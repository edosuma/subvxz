02:11.642 --> 02:13.443
Tell me!

02:14.929 --> 02:17.348
If you know what the ending
should be, then just tell me.

02:17.448 --> 02:20.817
- It just has to be surprising...
- Don't say surprising and inevitable.

02:24.921 --> 02:27.993
- But in this story, what does that mean?
- You've got her at the top of a building.

02:28.093 --> 02:31.729
She takes a step off.
You set up her belief in God.

02:31.829 --> 02:36.001
Some belief in some God she thinks will
catch her, and we hope it will catch her.

02:36.101 --> 02:38.803
So should she not jump,
or should she jump and be saved,

02:38.903 --> 02:40.138
caught by something
or someone or should...

02:40.238 --> 02:43.839
- Just has to be surprising and inevitable.
- Surprising and inevitable.

02:44.408 --> 02:47.512
- I'm sending it to you.
- Don't send it to me. Un-send it!

02:47.612 --> 02:49.528
You're trying to get me
to give you an ending.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.621
- I'm onto something.
- You're absolutely onto something.

02:51.721 --> 02:53.032
But you want some archetypal ending.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.411
If you're doing some "let him
figure it out" thing, spare me.

02:55.511 --> 02:58.789
I've been walking the earth for half
as long as you and I need some help.

02:58.889 --> 03:01.092
...the "archetypes"
and line them up and shoot them.

03:01.192 --> 03:04.929
- Don't rag on archetype construction.
- You can't tell a real story with any detail

03:05.029 --> 03:09.133
if you're a slave to some Joseph Campbell
one-size-fits-all mad lib

03:09.233 --> 03:12.868
that applies to everybody
on the face of the Earth.

03:12.969 --> 03:16.444
Are you feeling you're close and you're
wanting me to validate the work you've done,

03:16.544 --> 03:19.743
- or are you feeling that...
- I'm feeling that I'm shit.

03:19.843 --> 03:24.690
And I'm feeling you have the power to
make me slightly less shitty, and you won't.

03:28.118 --> 03:30.571
You are the least...

03:30.671 --> 03:33.747
shitty person...

03:34.647 --> 03:36.196
I know.

03:37.327 --> 03:39.827
- So why do I feel like...
- Because congratulations.

03:39.927 --> 03:42.631
- For what?
- You're a writer.

05:38.215 --> 05:41.452
- Thanks for giving us an early look.
- The kids just moved out.

05:41.552 --> 05:45.721
Don't worry, it's only June.
It'll air out over the summer.

05:49.293 --> 05:50.812
- What?
- What?

05:50.912 --> 05:52.780
- What?
- What, what?

05:52.930 --> 05:56.968
You know, I just gave this tour to the kid
who's going to be your roommate in the fall.

05:57.068 --> 05:59.770
You guys are so different.
What are you majoring in?

05:59.870 --> 06:02.572
- Writing.
- He's working on writing.

06:02.672 --> 06:07.197
- What's he studying? The roommate.
- Science, I think.

06:07.378 --> 06:09.045
Zero sense of humor.

06:11.264 --> 06:13.318
You'll have all summer
to get used to the idea.

06:13.418 --> 06:16.220
- I'm working on writing?
- Yes, you're learning to write.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.472
You're a writer who's writing
while he's learning to write.

06:20.157 --> 06:21.159
- Two, please.
- Three.

06:21.259 --> 06:22.710
- Sorry, three.
- Right this way.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.886
Thank you.

06:26.863 --> 06:28.900
- Jesus!
- You asked me to come to dinner.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.336
- You asked me to read it.
- It's like a bloodbath.

06:31.436 --> 06:34.038
- A lot of it's punctuation. You got a letter.
- It's a style.

06:34.138 --> 06:35.673
- Don't say Cormac McCarthy.
- Cormac McCarthy.

06:35.773 --> 06:39.644
He made a huge impact, but he wasn't
sending out work at your age.

06:39.744 --> 06:43.247
Unless you have a real idea about the ending,
it's time for me to start sending it out.

06:43.347 --> 06:46.150
You just said you need an idea.
You just said it's not ready.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.035
- I do need an idea.
- So?

06:48.135 --> 06:49.971
- So give me one.
- I don't have one.

06:50.071 --> 06:52.223
If you do, you owe it to me,
because I don't think you have any ideas

06:52.323 --> 06:54.792
with your critical voice
constantly inside my head.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.127
You guys fight like my parents.

06:57.227 --> 07:00.898
But they say that's what keeps them hot
for each other, so I guess it's okay.

07:00.998 --> 07:04.151
You've got six, at least four years
of school ahead of you.

07:04.251 --> 07:06.737
- You're not supposed to know how to...
- I sent it out.

07:06.837 --> 07:08.039
- No, you didn't.
- You sent what out?

07:08.139 --> 07:11.209
- Jump. My story, I sent it out.
- Where, to be rewritten?

07:11.309 --> 07:12.610
- Mean.
- Sorry.

07:12.710 --> 07:15.914
This could be a good story. Way down
the line it could, but it needs...

07:16.014 --> 07:17.899
- What, you?
- Mean.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.100
- Sorry.
- Your dad's cute.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.586
You know, I know I can't...
Mean, mean, mean.

07:21.686 --> 07:23.271
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- What's it about?

07:23.371 --> 07:25.156
You only get one shot with these places.

07:25.256 --> 07:27.992
It's about what goes through a woman's mind
from the time she jumps off a building

07:28.092 --> 07:29.894
until she lands and dies.

07:29.994 --> 07:31.829
- You opened my mail?
- She did.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.694
- You opened my mail?
- Where did you send it?

07:33.794 --> 07:36.498
- Why did you open...
- I thought you didn't have any siblings.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.088
Half-sibling. She's my half-sibling.

07:40.188 --> 07:42.540
- Where did you send it?
- You haven't heard of it.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.208
- Oh, God.
- It's an online literary.

07:44.308 --> 07:46.744
- What's the name of it? The web thing?
- You haven't... You haven't heard of it.

07:46.844 --> 07:50.415
Try me. Fertile... something?
Bitter, whatever it is?

07:50.515 --> 07:53.818
- Subtly very mean.
- I'm sorry, tell me. I'll be good.

07:53.918 --> 07:55.286
- Blow Back.
- Gesundheit.

07:55.386 --> 07:56.837
- So?
- I'll have a chardonnay.

07:56.937 --> 07:58.823
- Me too.
- And a glass of red wine.

07:58.923 --> 08:00.525
- May I see some identif...
- They're for me.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.058
- All of them?
- It's a stressful time.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.597
You're leaving home. I'm shaken up too.

08:05.697 --> 08:08.600
- I'm not leaving home.
- You're going away to college.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.901
I'm not going away.

08:10.001 --> 08:13.135
Don't be ridiculous.
After the summer, you're g...

08:14.187 --> 08:18.035
One, two, three, four... 43, 44, 45...

08:18.135 --> 08:20.077
- 67, 68, 69.
- Okay.

08:20.177 --> 08:21.312
- 70, 71...
- Okay.

08:21.412 --> 08:23.468
76, 77...

08:23.568 --> 08:25.636
82, 83, 84, 85.

08:25.736 --> 08:27.471
- Mr. and Mrs. Durning?
- What's your point?

08:27.571 --> 08:31.142
I'm moving 85 steps away from you.
That doesn't rate as going away to college.

08:31.242 --> 08:33.057
- Do you want me to move across the park?
- Stop it!

08:33.157 --> 08:36.681
What am I doing?
You asked me to read it, I read it.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.350
I'm giving you my advice
as one adult to another.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.818
Why are you getting so upset?
I thought we were both adults.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.320
- We are, but it's different.
- Why?

08:43.419 --> 08:47.577
Because one adult came out
of the other adult's vagina!

08:48.525 --> 08:50.259
What?

08:57.800 --> 09:01.499
- Maybe I'll see you.
- Yeah, okay, bye.

09:09.580 --> 09:12.648
- She seems nice.
- She's awful.

09:16.453 --> 09:20.758
- There's something wrong with us.
- It's not just us. Nobody sleeps anymore.

09:20.858 --> 09:23.476
Besides, I'm not going to watch it
without you, so if you don't either,

09:23.576 --> 09:25.596
we'll have a six-week break
while you're in California.

09:25.696 --> 09:28.530
<i>If I can just spot
the triggering mechanism...</i>

09:28.932 --> 09:30.656
<i>Hello.</i>

09:35.905 --> 09:37.968
<i>It seems louder over here.</i>

09:38.068 --> 09:40.375
<i>Hand me that candle, will you?</i>

09:43.613 --> 09:48.016
Put ze candle back.

10:03.067 --> 10:04.724
<i>Wait.</i>

10:07.070 --> 10:10.639
<i>Wait. Where are you going?</i>

10:11.241 --> 10:13.844
<i>I was gonna make a pretzel.</i>

10:14.544 --> 10:17.415
Your dad's picking you up
at the airport. It'll be fun.

10:17.515 --> 10:20.450
Step-family. It'll be step-fun.

10:20.550 --> 10:21.919
- Oh, crap, crap, crap!
- What?

10:22.019 --> 10:23.550
- I forgot my...
- What did you need? No, I can get it.

10:23.650 --> 10:25.854
Just don't, don't, don't!

10:28.458 --> 10:30.814
Jesus, Jackie.

10:32.596 --> 10:33.698
Why won't it be fun?

10:33.798 --> 10:35.166
- Taxi?
- Yes, please.

10:35.266 --> 10:38.001
Your father looks happy. He looks sweet.

10:38.101 --> 10:41.371
- What does that mean?
- Where's your suitcase.

10:41.471 --> 10:44.542
For the summer? Is there anything
other than shorts in there? Pants?

10:44.642 --> 10:47.279
Do they even wear pants in California
when they're not...

10:47.379 --> 10:49.913
- Yes?
- Whatever. Shoes?

10:50.013 --> 10:54.785
Flip flops? Can you walk in those things?
What am I saying, nobody walks out there.

10:54.885 --> 10:56.788
- Can you drive in them?
- Not that you would know.

10:56.888 --> 11:00.091
- Many people don't drive.
- I don't drive.

11:00.191 --> 11:02.856
What about books? What will you read
during the day or at night?

11:02.956 --> 11:06.230
- What will you read at night?
- Maybe I won't read. Maybe I'll watch TV.

11:06.330 --> 11:10.686
Maybe I won't do anything at all except
stare into space, relax and breathe.

11:11.785 --> 11:13.589
Jesus.

11:14.485 --> 11:16.977
- What line'd you call?
- <i>I sent you On The Town.</i>

11:17.077 --> 11:19.526
- I just got it.
- <i>What'd you think of it?</i>

11:19.626 --> 11:22.046
- I just got it.
- <i>What'd you think?</i>

11:22.146 --> 11:25.483
I think it's long and full of adverbs.
Should I come in?

11:25.583 --> 11:27.685
<i>No, no. Read it. I'll hang up.</i>

11:27.785 --> 11:30.788
- I'll call you as soon as I'm done.
- <i>No, I need to know I can reach you.</i>

11:30.888 --> 11:33.128
- I'm here. You can reach me here.
- <i>No, I...</i>

11:33.228 --> 11:37.094
I'm going to give you your own special
ringtone so I always know it's you.

11:37.194 --> 11:40.298
<i>Yeah, but later, what hap...
Like, what, what if...</i>

11:40.398 --> 11:44.266
On and in my hand. Reachable.

11:44.718 --> 11:45.776
Always.

11:45.903 --> 11:47.719
Excuse me.

11:52.208 --> 11:55.410
<i>What did you mean about Dad being sweet?</i>

11:55.579 --> 11:58.632
- <i>Just what I said.</i>
- <i>You just meant that he's sweet?</i>

11:58.732 --> 12:01.585
- <i>Unless something goes wrong.</i>
- <i>Then what is he?</i>

12:01.685 --> 12:03.588
How do I know that
I can reach you at any time?

12:03.688 --> 12:05.722
<i>Not around.</i>

12:05.822 --> 12:07.992
I need to know that you are reachable.

12:08.292 --> 12:11.377
Hey, I'm heading out. Thank you.

12:11.827 --> 12:14.560
- Have fun. Where are you going?
- Aruba.

12:14.660 --> 12:17.067
- Nice.
- My wife's mother's coming with us.

12:17.167 --> 12:18.908
Mothers are awful.

12:19.268 --> 12:22.273
<i>I have plans later, so if I don't answer,
we'll talk when we talk.</i>

12:22.373 --> 12:23.608
<i>Talk when we talk?</i>

12:23.908 --> 12:27.789
- <i>Who is this? Plans?</i>
- <i>No, not those kinds of...</i>

12:27.889 --> 12:31.317
<i>I don't know and I don't want to know
how many years it's been,</i>

12:31.417 --> 12:35.419
<i>but at some point, I think it's actually
bad for you not to have...</i>

12:35.519 --> 12:39.156
<i>plans. For your health, I mean.
Powering down.</i>

12:39.256 --> 12:43.325
What is the matter with you?
I need to have a definite answer.

12:48.225 --> 12:52.086
- On and in my hand. Reachable always.
- Everyone needs a little peace...

12:52.186 --> 12:53.922
<i>I don't really have plans.
Call me when you land.</i>

12:54.098 --> 12:55.913
Everybody... <i>You there?</i>

12:56.013 --> 12:58.406
- What?
- Peace.

13:56.165 --> 13:59.768
No, no, no, no, no, no! I was waiting!

13:59.904 --> 14:02.425
You're a horrible man!

14:52.957 --> 14:55.925
- Hello?
- Oh, hello?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.061
- How...
- Peter, how are you?

14:58.161 --> 15:02.032
I'm doing great. No complaints.
I'm doing great.

15:02.132 --> 15:04.501
Well, good. I'm so glad.

15:04.601 --> 15:05.861
- What?
- What?

15:05.961 --> 15:09.206
- Did you say "well?"
- You're doing well. Not "great."

15:09.306 --> 15:11.931
- "Well." Anyway, I'm so glad.
- Who are you talking to?

15:12.031 --> 15:14.211
- Talking to Angelo's mama.
- May I talk to her?

15:14.311 --> 15:16.146
- <i>That's okay, she doesn't have t...</i>
- Hi.

15:16.246 --> 15:18.614
- Hello, how are you?
- Good.

15:20.583 --> 15:23.153
- So what have you been up to?
- Playing.

15:23.253 --> 15:25.171
- <i>How's that going?</i>
- Good.

15:25.271 --> 15:26.740
- Well.
- What?

15:26.840 --> 15:29.359
- Nothing.
- What are you doing?

15:29.459 --> 15:33.764
Working. Editing. I have deadlines.

15:33.864 --> 15:38.299
- I'm in fiction, but still they want...
- My mommy has a baby in her tummy.

15:41.838 --> 15:43.972
Hi, hello.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.544
You haven't answered your phone.
It's been five days.

15:47.644 --> 15:50.238
- Why haven't you answered y...
- What's up?

15:50.847 --> 15:53.287
What's up?

15:53.387 --> 15:55.517
Yeah, you doing okay?

15:56.152 --> 15:57.565
Yeah.

15:58.054 --> 16:00.914
<i>I'm doing... great.</i>

16:16.138 --> 16:18.742
I promise you this is the last time
I'll bother you till the fall.

16:18.842 --> 16:22.346
I'll lay it on the floor, pick it up
and go. I just want to see if it fits.

16:22.446 --> 16:24.347
He's going to kill me
for starting to decorate,

16:24.447 --> 16:26.484
but I also know if the room
looks nice, he's more likely to...

16:26.584 --> 16:28.293
He dropped out.

16:40.762 --> 16:43.267
<i>I hope you take a moment
before you react to this.</i>

16:43.667 --> 16:46.003
<i>This is not something I'm doing lightly.</i>

16:46.403 --> 16:49.138
<i>School and frankly New York City...</i>

16:49.238 --> 16:50.706
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

16:51.441 --> 16:53.275
<i>They're not for me.</i>

16:55.134 --> 16:56.945
Thank you.

17:14.463 --> 17:17.065
- Miss Durning.
- I'll follow you.

17:26.075 --> 17:29.580
Do you have a power port?
I need to charge my laptop and my phone.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.048
I do have one, yes, ma'am.

17:31.148 --> 17:34.749
I'll need you for a few hours.
More than a few. Are you free?

17:35.918 --> 17:38.592
- I told them it was "as directed."
- No problem.

17:41.391 --> 17:45.380
It's still in there, and the issue
goes to print in three hours.

17:45.629 --> 17:46.964
Regular.

17:47.064 --> 17:50.463
I don't want to live in a world where a cup
of coffee has to be described as regular

17:50.563 --> 17:53.370
unless it's 1940 and the guy
means cream and sugar.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.806
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- On my way to a meeting.

17:55.906 --> 17:57.240
- <i>Where?</i>
- West Side.

17:57.340 --> 18:00.243
- <i>I want you to look at it.</i>
- Send it to me, I'll get it on my phone.

18:01.656 --> 18:03.333
Got it.

18:15.091 --> 18:17.709
3550, there it is.

18:19.896 --> 18:21.949
That's a nice house.

18:22.432 --> 18:24.434
Yes, ma'am, it is.

18:25.296 --> 18:27.605
No, no, no, get in, get in, get...
get back in, get back in the car.

18:27.705 --> 18:30.288
- Ma'am?
- Get in.

18:38.514 --> 18:42.351
Ma'am, any idea how long we'll be here?

18:42.451 --> 18:46.414
I just have to see about something.
Shouldn't take long.

19:09.479 --> 19:11.214
Jesus!

19:11.314 --> 19:14.516
Yeah, they come out of the hills
'cause they're thirsty.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.995
This place is terrifying.

19:25.761 --> 19:28.196
Is that who you're waiting for?

19:33.937 --> 19:35.605
Follow him.

19:35.705 --> 19:37.459
- Ma'am?
- Follow him, follow him, follow him.

19:49.051 --> 19:51.085
Go slower.

19:52.438 --> 19:54.639
Go slower, slow down.

19:55.225 --> 19:57.034
And pull over.

20:06.602 --> 20:07.971
- Wetsuits?
- Ma'am?

20:08.071 --> 20:12.109
Californians have such thin skin. I'd like
to see one of them try to swim back east.

20:12.209 --> 20:13.871
- The water can get kind of...
- What is your name?

20:13.971 --> 20:17.478
- Ramon.
- Ramon, where is the ladies' room?

20:18.047 --> 20:22.852
Well, they're there, but I think
they're closed or broken or something.

20:22.952 --> 20:25.823
- Somewhere, there must be some place...
- Just those, I think.

20:25.923 --> 20:28.308
That's ridiculous.
Where do these people pee?

20:28.408 --> 20:33.206
I don't know for positive, but can't they
just go in their suits? Warms them up.

20:52.242 --> 20:54.731
<i>No, yo sé, si.
No, yo trabajé toda la noche.</i>

21:02.592 --> 21:03.770
<i>Sí, yo te llamo después.</i>

21:52.508 --> 21:54.277
Oh, shit!

21:54.377 --> 21:56.479
Shit, shit, shit!

21:56.579 --> 21:58.490
Shit!

22:12.428 --> 22:15.965
- What's he doing?
- Looking for a job?

22:16.065 --> 22:17.832
Thanks.

22:31.814 --> 22:34.315
Follow him, follow him, follow him.

22:36.652 --> 22:38.788
<i>Leave a message at the tone.</i>

22:38.888 --> 22:41.758
Oh, come on.
You haven't called me all day.

22:41.858 --> 22:44.511
Where are you?
I know you read what I sent.

22:44.611 --> 22:46.029
Get closer.

22:46.129 --> 22:49.896
- I like to keep one car length...
- Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer.

22:51.567 --> 22:52.769
I want to start a new life here,

22:52.869 --> 22:56.871
but that doesn't mean there has to be
this kind of distance between us.

23:00.276 --> 23:01.725
<i>Call me.</i>

23:06.349 --> 23:08.151
- Get closer.
- <i>We both need to make an effort here.</i>

23:08.251 --> 23:10.685
To be honest, ma'am,
I really think I'm close enough.

23:12.521 --> 23:16.824
God damn it! I just got rear ended
by some asshole tailgater!

23:24.200 --> 23:26.228
Jesus!

23:29.905 --> 23:30.874
I'm very sorry, sir.

23:30.974 --> 23:34.177
- It's okay. Will you step out of the car...
- You two have to pull over!

23:34.277 --> 23:36.343
Is anyone else in the car?

23:48.657 --> 23:50.827
- What happened?
- Are you kidding me?

23:50.927 --> 23:53.429
Jesus, it's so bright!

23:53.529 --> 23:56.364
You need to get these cars
off the street!

23:56.899 --> 24:00.537
Don't act like I'm the only crazy one.
What are you doing here?

24:00.637 --> 24:02.172
I'm living my life.

24:02.272 --> 24:05.608
- Here, I will live and work and...
- What, ride around on that thing?

24:05.708 --> 24:07.711
Many great writers
didn't believe in academia.

24:07.811 --> 24:09.967
- Name three.
- Hemingway, Gore Vidal...

24:10.067 --> 24:12.916
- That's two.
- I am choking. Do you understand?

24:13.016 --> 24:15.452
- In that city, in that apartment!
- Don't be dramatic.

24:15.552 --> 24:19.256
I'm choking on the women there.
These soulless free-floating heads.

24:19.356 --> 24:22.282
And every encounter I have with one
makes me want to be celibate

24:22.382 --> 24:25.428
- for the rest of my life.
- And the problem with that would be...

24:25.528 --> 24:27.331
- This is unhealthy.
- It was a joke.

24:27.431 --> 24:30.634
Jesus, I was joking!
That's the problem with Los Angeles.

24:30.734 --> 24:34.737
When they don't educate you,
and they don't educate you,

24:34.837 --> 24:39.009
you fail to develop the brain receptors
needed to have a fucking sense of humor!

24:39.109 --> 24:40.777
You have one. I've seen it.

24:40.877 --> 24:44.081
But you get out here
and on that thing and you lose it.

24:44.181 --> 24:46.416
You lose the power of reason.

24:46.516 --> 24:49.386
- Your father's just fine with this?
- You don't want to know.

24:49.486 --> 24:52.221
- What did he say?
- Just be happy.

24:52.321 --> 24:55.555
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
What's wrong with our apartment?

24:55.655 --> 24:58.215
Cleaned out the closet lately?

24:58.815 --> 25:01.718
You want me back there so you can
watch me miserably struggle over something

25:01.818 --> 25:04.935
- that I'll never do just right.
- Nobody does it "just right."

25:05.035 --> 25:06.921
And you shit on me
for getting on a surfboard,

25:07.021 --> 25:09.806
something you could never do
because you might get your hair wet!

25:09.906 --> 25:13.009
- And by the way, I sleep out here.
- Of course you do, it's Los Angeles.

25:13.109 --> 25:16.280
- There's no reason to get out of bed!
- Oh, my God!

25:16.380 --> 25:17.714
Go back to New York.

25:17.814 --> 25:20.417
Swim laps in a chlorinated pool
50 stories up in the air.

25:20.517 --> 25:23.186
Do whatever you want. I don't care!
You know why?

25:23.286 --> 25:25.722
Because you're not interesting
to me anymore.

25:25.822 --> 25:27.958
This is interesting to me.

25:28.058 --> 25:32.293
And this is interesting to me,
and you could never do it.

25:42.905 --> 25:45.792
Don't doubt yourself. We told the guy
to write what he knows and he did.

25:45.892 --> 25:48.324
I would tell your young copy editor
that the only other choice

25:48.424 --> 25:50.366
at this late date is a very thin story

25:50.466 --> 25:52.127
- about a heartbroken pigeon.
- <i>Send it by me.</i>

25:52.227 --> 25:56.686
I'll send you the draft now and I'll
call you with the final in three... six.

25:56.786 --> 25:58.321
- <i>Where are you now?</i>
- I'm at lunch.

25:58.421 --> 26:00.957
- <i>Where?</i>
- Midtown. I'm reachable.

26:01.057 --> 26:05.027
- You've never done this before?
- No, but I'm in very good physical condition.

26:05.127 --> 26:06.596
You must have a lot of money.

26:06.696 --> 26:10.900
You're staying in a nice hotel,
you've hired me for a second day in a row.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.771
- I think you should get an instructor.
- I don't need some illiterate teenager

26:14.871 --> 26:18.274
telling me how to lie on my belly
and splash my arms in the water.

26:18.374 --> 26:20.339
I live in the most
challenging city in the country.

26:20.439 --> 26:23.013
I can navigate a few small waves
in sunny Santa Monica.

26:23.113 --> 26:25.346
That goes on your leg.

26:27.583 --> 26:32.622
I swim 400 meters three times a week.
I've swum in Long Island Sound.

26:32.722 --> 26:35.525
I've leaned half my body over a yacht
to pull my wallet out of the Hudson.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.892
You don't have to worry about me.

26:42.932 --> 26:45.091
Freezing in here!

27:14.163 --> 27:15.432
Couldn't you please get a teacher?

27:15.532 --> 27:18.435
Do I think I'm going to be great
the first few times I do it? No.

27:18.535 --> 27:20.180
- We could ask one of those guys.
- I know plenty of people

27:20.280 --> 27:23.738
who have taught themselves various sports
and they've done just fine.

27:30.279 --> 27:32.409
Could we have a signal?

27:32.509 --> 27:34.008
What are you talking about?

27:34.108 --> 27:36.653
I'm responsible for your safety
while you have me on the clock.

27:36.753 --> 27:38.321
- No you're not.
- Well, irregardless...

27:38.421 --> 27:39.823
- Oh, my God.
- What?

27:39.923 --> 27:41.468
- There's no such word.
- What?

27:41.568 --> 27:45.480
- Go on.
- Could we agree on an arm signal?

27:45.580 --> 27:48.896
So if you're in trouble out there,
I can do something.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.669
It's not your job, but yes.

27:52.769 --> 27:56.604
If you see me give the international
S.O.S. sign,

27:56.705 --> 27:59.707
it'd be very kind of you to call 9-1...

28:02.312 --> 28:04.847
- What is happening?
- I think you need a lesson.

28:04.947 --> 28:09.818
What I need is for someone to get
this thing out past these first few waves.

28:21.364 --> 28:23.032
You want to try it?

28:23.132 --> 28:25.902
Hello, my name is Jackie Durning.

28:26.002 --> 28:30.340
Would you do me the tremendous favor
of allowing me to pay you money

28:30.740 --> 28:33.183
to take my surfboard and...

28:33.283 --> 28:36.880
pull it or push it out there
just past those first few waves?

28:36.980 --> 28:40.183
Once you're out there, I'll swim to you.
I'm an excellent swimmer.

28:40.283 --> 28:44.254
I'll take the board from you
and you can come in and resume...

28:44.354 --> 28:47.290
- What? Doing nothing?
- Pretty much.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.130
- Will you do it?
- Okay.

28:54.163 --> 28:55.590
- Right, here I go.
- Remember.

28:55.690 --> 28:59.769
Yes, yes. I remember. I know it sounds
like hubris, but once I get out there,

28:59.869 --> 29:03.538
I really think I'm going to be better
than average at intuiting how to do this.

29:19.731 --> 29:21.756
Thank you very much.

29:28.665 --> 29:31.034
Darn it. Sorry.

29:31.134 --> 29:33.301
Poor planning on my part.

29:33.401 --> 29:36.491
I'm going to have my driver give you money.
Would $30 be all right?

29:36.591 --> 29:38.255
Yeah.

29:49.585 --> 29:51.119
What?

30:00.362 --> 30:04.100
Help! I'm coming! Lifeguard, lifeguard!

30:04.200 --> 30:05.901
Help!

30:06.001 --> 30:08.705
No! No!

30:08.805 --> 30:11.690
Lifeguard, help!

30:12.107 --> 30:14.444
- No, you idiot, I'm fine!
- Help!

30:14.544 --> 30:16.387
That wasn't it!

30:24.820 --> 30:27.114
I'm fine!

30:32.261 --> 30:35.665
- Let's get you back to shore.
- I just got out here.

30:36.065 --> 30:39.503
Well, just to be safe, show me you can put
your leash on and get back on your board.

30:39.603 --> 30:42.870
- I can.
- Great. Show me.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.817
It's possible I can't.

31:08.797 --> 31:11.601
- I didn't need any help. I was fine.
- You're welcome.

31:11.701 --> 31:14.536
- Maybe this man could give you a lesson.
- I don't need a lesson.

31:30.947 --> 31:34.580
<i>Gore Vidal was an Olympic athlete,
slept with men and fought in a world war.</i>

31:34.680 --> 31:37.259
<i>Talk to me when you've done
even one of those...</i>

32:07.856 --> 32:10.390
I want to surf like that.

32:39.221 --> 32:42.091
You just bailed?
Our parents would freak.

32:42.191 --> 32:44.094
Your parents were fine
with you leaving school?

32:44.694 --> 32:46.821
- My dad was.
- Not your mom?

32:48.793 --> 32:53.543
<i>Hemingway was in the army, lived
all over the world and shot himself!</i>

32:53.643 --> 32:56.904
She's had a slightly harder time
adjusting to the idea.

33:24.833 --> 33:27.370
The weather in this God-forsaken place!

33:27.470 --> 33:29.505
Most people put their wetsuits on
at the beach.

33:29.605 --> 33:33.373
Good for them. It took me 20 minutes and
someone from housekeeping to get into it.

33:33.473 --> 33:35.178
- Yes, I'm here.
- <i>What's wrong with it?</i>

33:35.278 --> 33:37.613
Page 17 of the proofs.

33:37.713 --> 33:41.951
"Gender". Feels like he wanted to write
"sex", but was too spineless to do it.

33:42.051 --> 33:43.878
- I can hear you fine.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

33:43.978 --> 33:47.490
In a taxi, downtown. Way down.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.409
In fact, I'm heading into a tunnel,
so it's possible we'll...

33:50.509 --> 33:53.343
Fill this out and sign, please.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.606
- Your age?
- I'm sorry.

34:03.706 --> 34:05.742
- What's your age?
- What's your age?

34:05.842 --> 34:08.812
- Thirty seven.
- Yeah, good. Me too.

34:08.911 --> 34:11.505
- Good morning.
- Hey.

34:15.117 --> 34:18.721
Just so you know, another driver will be
arriving during your lesson to pick you up.

34:18.821 --> 34:21.123
- Why?
- I'm not available after 1:30, ma'am.

34:21.224 --> 34:24.056
- Why?
- Professional reasons.

34:25.994 --> 34:28.965
I have to get my kids from school.
All of them.

34:29.065 --> 34:31.668
- 'Cause I missed two days.
- Pick them up and come back.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.437
I won't have to meet someone new
and you can stay on the clock.

34:34.536 --> 34:36.734
The limo company won't lose anything.
They never have to know.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.875
You don't want my kids in the back
yelling and throwing stuff.

34:38.975 --> 34:40.310
I'll see you when I'm done.

34:41.010 --> 34:44.945
Okay, Jackie. Lie down
on your surfboard for me.

34:55.524 --> 34:58.492
Good. Paddle your arms.

35:00.795 --> 35:02.553
- Is there a problem?
- I understand, I'll paddle.

35:02.653 --> 35:05.966
I don't have to do it now.
I'm lying in the dirt.

35:06.602 --> 35:08.371
Okay.

35:08.471 --> 35:13.109
Well, after you're done paddling, place
your hands on either side of your chest,

35:13.209 --> 35:14.810
push up arching your back.

35:14.910 --> 35:18.915
And a lot of beginners start
on one knee and then stand up.

35:19.015 --> 35:24.853
For later, what you're going
to do is jump or pop up.

35:24.953 --> 35:27.721
- Now?
- Why not now?

35:34.563 --> 35:36.797
Good, try it again.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.470
Okay, there's no need to rush to pop up.

35:41.570 --> 35:43.239
I'd rather just learn
the right way from the beginning.

35:43.339 --> 35:44.425
This isn't the wrong way...

35:44.525 --> 35:47.308
I'm sorry, it hasn't stopped.
I think I answered it.

35:47.676 --> 35:49.444
Yes, what?

35:49.544 --> 35:52.220
I do stand by it.
The Flowers That Flowered?

35:52.320 --> 35:55.161
Seriously? There's whimsy,
and then there's whatever that is.

35:55.261 --> 35:59.255
My phone is on. Turn off my phone.
What were you saying?

35:59.355 --> 36:00.489
Here's the deal, Jackie.

36:00.589 --> 36:04.327
We are going to put this inanimate object
into an ever-changing environment.

36:04.427 --> 36:06.961
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

36:07.061 --> 36:09.165
The surfboard does nothing on its own.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.811
It only moves if this ever-changing
environment moves it,

36:12.911 --> 36:16.606
or if you, who are also
ever changing, make it move.

36:16.706 --> 36:18.808
- Do you understand?
- Yes, obviously, I...

36:18.908 --> 36:22.044
The ocean moves over a sandy floor
that we cannot see.

36:22.144 --> 36:25.375
When the shape of that floor rises,
a wave is formed,

36:25.475 --> 36:28.201
and that wave moves towards
the shore, do you understand?

36:28.301 --> 36:30.019
I'm not stupid.
If you can understand it...

36:30.119 --> 36:33.756
That wave moving toward the shore
will also move anything in its path.

36:33.856 --> 36:37.286
If you or the object are in its way,
it will hit you.

36:37.386 --> 36:40.843
Therefore, the safest place
you can be in the water is where?

36:42.302 --> 36:45.868
The safest place to be given that you
and the object are ever-changing?

36:45.968 --> 36:48.335
At home watching 20/20?

36:49.404 --> 36:52.873
- Can I have some water?
- We're going to paddle out to there.

36:53.775 --> 36:57.113
When I tell you to, you're going to paddle
to where the wave is breaking.

36:57.213 --> 36:59.448
If you're lucky enough to catch a wave,

36:59.548 --> 37:03.886
you'll stand up, placing your feet evenly
over the center line of the surfboard

37:03.986 --> 37:05.821
and ride that wave toward shore.

37:05.921 --> 37:10.526
If you're that lucky, well, then lower
yourself back down onto the surfboard,

37:10.626 --> 37:13.362
turn around and paddle back to me.

37:13.562 --> 37:17.765
Whatever happens,
you do as I say, understand?

37:20.802 --> 37:23.637
We can skip it and go back
if you're too freaked out.

37:24.839 --> 37:26.707
Let's go.

37:30.111 --> 37:34.650
The most dangerous part of surfing
is entering and exiting the water.

37:34.750 --> 37:39.202
What happens if this object comes between
you and an oncoming wave?

37:39.302 --> 37:40.322
What?

37:40.422 --> 37:44.858
- What happens if this inanimate object...
- For God's sake...

37:46.428 --> 37:48.962
Get on your board.

37:56.738 --> 37:59.430
Oh, my God!

38:00.175 --> 38:01.644
Tiring, isn't it?

38:01.744 --> 38:04.680
- Can we take a break?
- We are inside.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.782
- You know what that means?
- No.

38:06.882 --> 38:09.435
- We are in the impact zone.
- Oh, please.

38:09.535 --> 38:11.020
- Pardon?
- Nothing. Go ahead.

38:11.120 --> 38:15.490
If we stay here, we'll be hit by every
single wave that comes in

38:15.590 --> 38:18.392
and get tumbled in the white water.

38:19.427 --> 38:24.300
So we're going to go outside,
or beyond the breaking wave.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.967
See that one?

38:26.367 --> 38:29.071
- We're going to paddle beyond that.
- I can't.

38:29.171 --> 38:31.973
- You have to.
- Says who?

38:32.073 --> 38:34.108
Nobody's ever asked me that before.

38:37.512 --> 38:39.579
What is that?

38:40.560 --> 38:41.770
- Freak set.
- What?

38:41.870 --> 38:44.253
Bigger set of waves
than we've seen before.

38:44.353 --> 38:47.554
- Well, what do I do?
- Do you have children?

38:47.989 --> 38:50.418
- What did you say?
- Do you have a child?

38:50.518 --> 38:51.601
Yes.

38:51.701 --> 38:55.392
Paddle as if your child's life
depends on it.

38:55.797 --> 38:59.059
Paddle, Jackie. Paddle down hard.

39:06.241 --> 39:08.232
Good job.

39:09.711 --> 39:13.210
Boy, from this angle it doesn't look
so bad. I thought it was bigger...

39:20.455 --> 39:22.945
Get back on your board.

39:24.759 --> 39:27.561
Get on top of your surfboard.

39:30.866 --> 39:32.668
Sit up.

39:34.836 --> 39:36.478
Do you own an egg beater?

39:37.572 --> 39:38.607
I'm begging you.

39:38.707 --> 39:41.205
Assuming you've at least seen
an egg beater,

39:41.305 --> 39:43.980
I want you to move your ass
to the back of the board,

39:44.080 --> 39:47.016
hold onto the rail,
egg beater your legs around.

39:47.116 --> 39:50.586
I can turn the surfboard around.
Is this really the best use of our time?

39:51.386 --> 39:54.187
Why don't you try to turn
the board around your way?

39:54.289 --> 39:56.557
For God's sake!

40:16.277 --> 40:18.912
Can you explain it one more time?

40:19.681 --> 40:21.570
Slide back.

40:21.923 --> 40:24.986
Hold on. Egg-beater your legs.

40:27.522 --> 40:29.990
Good, do it again.

40:30.925 --> 40:33.193
Good, other way.

40:35.029 --> 40:37.834
It'll be to your benefit
to be able to do that quickly.

40:38.234 --> 40:40.469
- In general?
- Nope, now.

40:40.869 --> 40:43.972
Slide back, egg-beater your legs,

40:44.072 --> 40:46.008
paddle towards shore.

40:46.108 --> 40:50.829
If you catch it, stand up, bend your knees
and ride the wave towards shore.

40:50.929 --> 40:53.402
If you fall off, cover your head
and fall flat.

40:53.502 --> 40:55.651
You don't know what's on the bottom.
You hear me?

40:55.751 --> 40:58.285
- Yes, yes, whatever!
- One, two, three!

42:03.017 --> 42:05.709
Good job. Call me
if you want another lesson.

42:33.362 --> 42:35.079
<i>Hijo!</i>

42:40.288 --> 42:41.690
<i>Dickens!</i>

42:41.790 --> 42:44.458
- <i>Look who's texting!</i>
- <i>Dickens!</i>

42:44.558 --> 42:48.053
<i>Dickens wrote soap operas and was maniac
depressive. You don't want to be him.</i>

42:48.153 --> 42:49.731
<i>Heard from "Blow Hard"?</i>

42:49.831 --> 42:52.332
<i>Mean. Sorry. Blow Back?</i>

42:53.034 --> 42:54.855
Thank you.

43:01.176 --> 43:03.111
- Did you go out?
- Yeah.

43:03.211 --> 43:06.980
- How was it?
- It was okay. Closed out.

43:07.315 --> 43:09.716
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

43:15.857 --> 43:17.893
Did you go out?

43:18.193 --> 43:20.060
I did.

43:20.662 --> 43:22.729
Closed out, right?

43:23.064 --> 43:24.267
Beautiful.

43:24.867 --> 43:28.135
Every day I'm out there
is absolutely beautiful.

43:34.208 --> 43:36.778
- Have you read this?
- I have.

43:36.878 --> 43:39.454
- It's supposed to be amazing.
- Is that for school?

43:39.554 --> 43:43.049
- No, for fun.
- Well, then you might actually enjoy it.

43:43.985 --> 43:46.071
What are you reading?

43:46.850 --> 43:50.590
A little bit of the world,
a little bit of pleasure.

43:51.325 --> 43:55.262
- Anything to avoid writing.
- You're a writer?

43:56.578 --> 44:01.803
Oh, my God, you are so lucky,
to write in a place like this.

44:01.903 --> 44:03.437
I am lucky.

44:06.724 --> 44:10.393
Can I ask you a question? Do you work?

44:11.145 --> 44:13.355
I'm sorry, I mean,
like, to survive, do you...

44:13.455 --> 44:16.916
I work, but I work to live,
not the other way around.

44:22.223 --> 44:25.025
I'm sort of stuck lately.

44:26.094 --> 44:29.298
How do you write here with the ocean
and the sunlight right outside?

44:29.398 --> 44:31.931
I have to agonize in a dark room.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.101
Yeah, I don't agonize.

44:38.122 --> 44:40.728
<i>I have an idea for your story.</i>

44:45.313 --> 44:47.199
This is an ever-changing environment,

44:47.299 --> 44:49.032
- so while we're out...
- Not again.

44:49.884 --> 44:51.918
You know a better way?

44:53.955 --> 44:57.624
Cover your head when you fall. Let's go.

45:37.131 --> 45:40.533
Hey! Who raised you, you ins...

46:13.734 --> 46:14.665
- Hello...
- What is it?

46:14.765 --> 46:17.105
- That's how you say hello?
- What's the idea?

46:18.247 --> 46:20.310
That's work calling.
Let's meet somewhere and...

46:20.410 --> 46:22.191
- You're still in LA?
- So?

46:22.291 --> 46:25.083
I've sent the story out.
Maybe you're right. Maybe no one will call.

46:25.183 --> 46:27.926
- I'm not going to agonize.
- You're going to agonize. You're a writer.

46:28.026 --> 46:30.168
It's agony.
I've never heard such a ridiculous...

46:30.268 --> 46:32.820
- I'll call you back.
- Don't call me back.

46:32.920 --> 46:37.393
- Dropout who reads Marquez. Cool.
- Yeah, they'll never get that.

46:37.493 --> 46:41.263
- They?
- My parents. Well, my mother.

46:41.363 --> 46:44.118
Once it's not being shoved down
your throat, you want to read it.

46:44.218 --> 46:48.203
Yeah, she's never going to get that.
I was lucky. Second kid.

46:48.303 --> 46:51.722
He wore them down, so by the time
they got to me, they were too tired to care.

46:53.641 --> 46:55.672
That is lucky.

46:57.078 --> 47:00.415
- Ignore it.
- Do you have any brothers or sisters?

47:00.515 --> 47:02.951
- I do.
- Good. So they can share the load.

47:03.051 --> 47:06.219
- How many?
- Two.

47:08.756 --> 47:10.536
One.

47:15.580 --> 47:17.904
I have a half-sister.

47:28.576 --> 47:30.587
And I don't...

47:30.929 --> 47:32.846
have a brother.

47:38.620 --> 47:40.787
I... I did...

47:41.723 --> 47:44.824
but I now don't.

47:48.896 --> 47:51.834
Oh, my God! It's worse!

47:51.934 --> 47:55.270
My arms! After all these times,
how can it be worse?

47:55.370 --> 47:58.205
- Sure you want a lesson every day?
- I'm sure.

47:59.473 --> 48:02.728
- Paddling hard, good for you.
- But I'm not getting anywhere.

48:02.828 --> 48:05.447
Well, just for today,

48:05.547 --> 48:09.248
if you can catch me,
I'll give you a ride.

48:36.477 --> 48:40.027
Can I ask you? How?

48:44.652 --> 48:47.822
He was... little.

48:47.922 --> 48:49.589
He...

48:50.557 --> 48:52.314
choked.

48:52.810 --> 48:54.544
Very quickly.

48:55.463 --> 48:58.166
- Your poor parents.
- Yeah.

48:58.266 --> 49:01.168
She thought he had him,
he'd thought she had him...

49:11.512 --> 49:13.636
What did you think?

49:17.218 --> 49:21.112
I told you not to call me back.
I'm sorry, who?

49:23.424 --> 49:25.792
Yes. One sec.

49:29.696 --> 49:33.067
Yeah, I see it. I'm here, I'm here.
I'm definitely here.

49:33.567 --> 49:35.337
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I can't talk now.

49:35.437 --> 49:38.540
- <i>You called me! Once again you...</i>
- I'm letting you know that I can't talk now.

49:38.640 --> 49:41.777
I've got some work I've gotta do and I
really want to concentrate on that, okay?

49:41.877 --> 49:45.345
- <i>Okay, break a leg.</i>
- What do you mean, "Break a..."

49:51.819 --> 49:54.790
- Hey, are you...
- I think so.

49:54.890 --> 49:56.058
- Okay. Hey!
- Hey.

49:56.158 --> 49:59.926
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

50:02.096 --> 50:05.133
Hey! Fuck.

50:05.233 --> 50:08.804
This is Jackie Durning. She's...
I work with her sometimes.

50:09.154 --> 50:10.372
You work together as...

50:10.472 --> 50:12.708
- I was work as... I work as his mother.
- She's my mother.

50:12.808 --> 50:15.844
Okay. Well, that makes sense. You know,
when we spoke on the phone, I didn't...

50:15.944 --> 50:17.795
- You didn't speak.
- We didn't?

50:17.895 --> 50:20.215
- You set this up!
- You know, we really like your story, man.

50:20.315 --> 50:23.252
- It's going to get better, too.
- Oh, well, I thought it was finished.

50:23.352 --> 50:24.527
- It is finished.
- It's going to get better.

50:24.627 --> 50:26.664
- It's not going to get any better.
- But he doesn't know yet.

50:26.764 --> 50:29.206
He doesn't know someone
at your place will figure that out,

50:29.306 --> 50:31.226
but he's got a great idea
for the ending.

50:31.326 --> 50:32.328
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

50:32.428 --> 50:35.830
- No, I don't. What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

50:35.930 --> 50:38.699
You're killing it. You set this up
and now you're killing it.

50:38.799 --> 50:40.833
She what?

50:42.970 --> 50:46.206
- I'm sorry, I'm a little slow, I...
- Why are you still here?

50:46.306 --> 50:48.410
Why are you still in your least
favorite city in the world?

50:48.510 --> 50:50.045
- I'm working on something.
- On what?

50:50.145 --> 50:52.447
Something. Where are you going?

50:52.547 --> 50:54.574
- If you really wanted this, you wouldn't...
- You should be afraid.

50:54.674 --> 50:56.818
But you know better. You know this isn't
where you want to be published!

50:56.918 --> 51:01.820
Whatever she's promised you isn't worth it.
Unless it's a new name for your magazine.

51:02.656 --> 51:05.577
Yes, enjoy the great news.
I'm just like you now.

51:05.677 --> 51:10.029
Too clever to have any respect
for anybody, including this poor guy.

51:21.509 --> 51:22.945
- Why?
- Why what?

51:23.045 --> 51:26.114
Why do all women fall feet first?
Makes no sense!

51:26.214 --> 51:29.318
'Cause we'd rather hurt our feet
than crack our heads open. Call us crazy.

51:29.418 --> 51:32.004
Yeah, you fall flat
you won't hurt anything.

51:32.104 --> 51:34.670
Here comes one. Lie down.

51:35.189 --> 51:36.391
- Fall flat!
- I will.

51:36.491 --> 51:39.084
- Jack...
- I will, I will, I will!

51:47.669 --> 51:49.836
Son of a bitch!

51:50.437 --> 51:51.451
Pull them out.

51:51.551 --> 51:53.942
- They don't come out.
- They don't come out?

51:54.042 --> 51:55.718
- They're barbs.
- What do I do?

51:55.818 --> 51:58.046
Break them off, try and dissolve
some of the protein.

51:58.146 --> 52:00.468
I can't do it. You do it.

52:00.568 --> 52:03.349
No, no, no, no, no.
I can do it, I can do it.

52:05.519 --> 52:08.123
- Oh, God, I can't do it.
- I'll do it.

52:08.223 --> 52:11.324
It's going to hurt. You might puke.
Or I might.

52:24.638 --> 52:27.376
- Your driver here?
- No, he won't be back for over an hour.

52:27.476 --> 52:30.848
Oh, God, it hurts so bad.
How do you even use this thing?

52:31.912 --> 52:33.548
You have to break down the protein.

52:33.648 --> 52:35.984
- How?
- Pee on it.

52:36.084 --> 52:38.687
- Pee on it? I can't pee on it.
- Why not?

52:38.787 --> 52:42.857
It's the bottom of my foot. I couldn't
reach it. How could I aim at it?

52:42.957 --> 52:46.293
Well, unless you want to be in agony
tonight and on crutches for a week,

52:46.593 --> 52:48.928
somebody's gotta pee on it.

52:57.872 --> 52:59.639
<i>I'm injured.</i>

53:01.592 --> 53:02.815
- Just do it.
- I'm trying.

53:02.915 --> 53:05.895
- How difficult is it?
- Hold on a second!

53:10.217 --> 53:11.686
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Who is this?

53:11.786 --> 53:13.622
- Who's this?
- You called me.

53:13.722 --> 53:17.591
- I got a text, someone's injured?
- Oh, yeah. Are you the husband?

53:17.691 --> 53:20.332
- Whose husband?
- My husband.

53:20.662 --> 53:21.696
- I'm injured.
- <i>What happened?</i>

53:21.796 --> 53:24.439
- There is something very wrong with my foot.
- Your foot?

53:24.539 --> 53:26.630
- Yes, it's horribly...
- <i>Horribly what?</i>

53:26.730 --> 53:30.209
- Splintered. It's horribly splintered.
- Splintered, or you got a splinter in it?

53:30.309 --> 53:31.773
- Whatever.
- <i>How bad can it be?</i>

53:31.873 --> 53:35.502
You never take your shoes off. Find someone
to help you, or better yet, go home.

53:35.602 --> 53:39.053
- I'm working. Shouldn't you be?
- What are you working on?

53:48.489 --> 53:49.924
- Are you doing it?
- You'd know.

53:50.024 --> 53:52.294
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not a machine, all right?

53:52.394 --> 53:56.030
Just... I need... sing something.

53:56.130 --> 53:58.967
- Did you say sing?
- Too quiet. I can't go.

53:59.067 --> 54:02.637
- Always, or just now?
- Just sing, all right?

54:02.737 --> 54:05.473
About water, dripping, or rain.

54:05.573 --> 54:08.364
Just do what I'm telling you to do.

54:37.438 --> 54:39.041
Can you unwrap?

54:39.141 --> 54:40.442
- I can't get it?
- Why not?

54:40.542 --> 54:43.028
Because my arms don't work.
You broke them with all the paddling.

54:43.128 --> 54:44.713
Let me do it.

54:48.015 --> 54:50.250
Now you're all... you're all tied up.

54:52.854 --> 54:54.536
What do you want me to do about it?

54:55.723 --> 54:58.924
Guess you should probably
take horrible advantage of me.

56:11.729 --> 56:14.510
I'm... I'm not 37.

56:14.610 --> 56:17.436
I didn't have to pee on your foot.

57:05.854 --> 57:08.055
Isn't he cool?

57:08.155 --> 57:09.841
Don't you want his life?

57:09.941 --> 57:13.461
Not really. Why is he hanging out
with a bunch of 20 year old kids?

57:13.561 --> 57:17.258
- Because he's cool!
- Because he's selling them weed.

57:17.358 --> 57:20.866
- He is?
- He is.

57:21.735 --> 57:25.970
- Want some?
- No. Makes me paranoid.

57:26.607 --> 57:31.312
So what? He writes, he surfs...
sells a little weed.

57:31.412 --> 57:34.613
Sounds better than the life
of most writers I know.

58:19.526 --> 58:21.360
Thank you.

58:23.130 --> 58:24.366
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

58:24.466 --> 58:28.052
- Thanks for dropping off my stuff.
- Are you okay?

58:28.152 --> 58:31.373
- Good, you?
- Good. How did you get home?

58:31.473 --> 58:33.806
I got a ride.

58:54.295 --> 58:56.029
Hey, how's it?

58:57.464 --> 58:59.531
Are you kidding me?

59:00.234 --> 59:01.867
What?

59:05.672 --> 59:09.108
- How are you today?
- Good. Very good.

59:09.777 --> 59:11.744
How are you?

59:12.646 --> 59:14.565
I'm well.

59:14.665 --> 59:18.184
I'm feeling very... very well.

59:20.220 --> 59:23.055
Come here, come here. Come here.

59:32.499 --> 59:36.135
- Everything okay?
- What is happening?

59:38.572 --> 59:41.075
Did he just kiss that girl?

59:41.175 --> 59:43.745
He might have. I don't think so.

59:43.845 --> 59:46.712
At the very least, he nuzzled that girl.

59:46.813 --> 59:49.782
Bummer. That's your boyfriend?

01:00:07.601 --> 01:00:09.498
Mrs. Jackson!

01:00:11.272 --> 01:00:13.407
Understandable, very interesting.

01:00:13.507 --> 01:00:15.707
Will you order food,
and will you get a table?

01:00:15.807 --> 01:00:17.879
- What are you going to do?
- Get out of the rest of my wetsuit.

01:00:17.979 --> 01:00:19.914
- Inside the car?
- There's a bathroom inside.

01:00:20.014 --> 01:00:21.282
- He can't see me in this.
- Why?

01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:23.916
He just can't. Please?

01:00:48.692 --> 01:00:50.378
That looks like...

01:00:51.478 --> 01:00:54.481
- Sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Jackie?

01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:00.021
- What are you doing here?
- Hi, what are you doing here? Hello.

01:01:00.121 --> 01:01:03.525
- This is Blanche, Brad, Newsome and Lex.
- Hello.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:05.993
Hey, did you want to introduce me?

01:01:06.093 --> 01:01:08.661
This is my friend Ramon.

01:01:10.531 --> 01:01:12.266
And, this is Ian.

01:01:12.366 --> 01:01:14.168
- Hello.
- Hey!

01:01:14.268 --> 01:01:19.474
- And how do you guys know each other?
- From... around. And you all?

01:01:20.124 --> 01:01:22.084
From around.

01:01:29.049 --> 01:01:30.907
This is weird.

01:01:31.007 --> 01:01:33.121
Well, have a nice lunch.
It was great to see you.

01:01:33.221 --> 01:01:35.520
Good to see you too.

01:01:48.935 --> 01:01:50.990
- Why does he call you Jackie?
- Because he hates me.

01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:54.606
It's not respectful.
He should call you "Mom" or "Mama."

01:01:57.444 --> 01:02:00.331
- And he shouldn't be getting high.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:02:00.431 --> 01:02:02.439
Maybe it's his friend's. You don't know.

01:02:04.885 --> 01:02:07.188
It's just pot,
for whatever that's worth.

01:02:07.288 --> 01:02:10.124
- Does that mean it's not a big deal?
- You never get high?

01:02:10.224 --> 01:02:12.182
Twice, in college. It wasn't pretty.

01:02:12.282 --> 01:02:15.163
It means there's no reason
to assume that it's a big deal.

01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:17.614
- You don't know what it means.
- Do you smoke pot?

01:02:17.714 --> 01:02:21.201
- No, allergic.
- Allergic.

01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:23.335
In a sense.

01:02:23.737 --> 01:02:25.340
- What about you?
- What?

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.843
Could you try some?
Smoke a little so I know what he's doing?

01:02:28.943 --> 01:02:30.775
I'd like to smoke
the whole thing, but...

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:34.648
I'm at work and I have to pick up
three small children in two hours. Sorry.

01:02:35.048 --> 01:02:37.349
Maybe you should smoke it.

01:02:56.246 --> 01:02:58.270
It's my office.

01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:02.307
Hello?

01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:06.533
I know.

01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:10.449
Yes, of course I'm listening.

01:03:20.527 --> 01:03:22.961
I have to call you back.

01:03:24.464 --> 01:03:27.700
- I don't feel anything.
- You probably should give it a minute.

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:31.164
Pretty fucked up?

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.147
I'm getting fired!

01:05:46.823 --> 01:05:49.091
Where did he go?

01:06:15.969 --> 01:06:17.729
Hello.

01:06:18.171 --> 01:06:20.174
- I'm...
- Of course I know who you are.

01:06:20.274 --> 01:06:24.677
- Of course, hello.
- Hello, I'm good.

01:06:26.746 --> 01:06:30.217
- What?
- Did you... what?

01:06:30.317 --> 01:06:31.869
Please, come in.

01:06:37.624 --> 01:06:39.493
I spent all day working on this.

01:06:39.593 --> 01:06:42.394
It would be just like me
to overcook it last minute.

01:06:43.596 --> 01:06:48.043
Can I offer you something
to drink, or anything?

01:06:49.242 --> 01:06:50.969
Or...

01:06:53.706 --> 01:06:56.410
- He's up there with a...
- Young woman?

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:57.578
- Well...
- He'll be fine.

01:06:57.678 --> 01:07:00.679
Don't worry. Door's open.

01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:08.887
- Yin and yang.
- Totally.

01:07:09.457 --> 01:07:11.759
- No.
- No?

01:07:11.859 --> 01:07:13.593
- Do re mi?
- Hi, I'm here.

01:07:13.693 --> 01:07:16.395
- Jesus!
- He can't help you now!

01:07:17.397 --> 01:07:20.467
Jesus. Little joke.

01:07:20.567 --> 01:07:22.499
Never mind.

01:07:23.637 --> 01:07:25.871
You thrilled to see me?

01:07:28.741 --> 01:07:31.846
I got past your obviously
horrible stepmother

01:07:31.946 --> 01:07:35.715
and her hideous, charmless child,
and that was a chore.

01:07:38.618 --> 01:07:40.417
You see, the point of that joke

01:07:40.517 --> 01:07:43.858
is to imply that they are clearly
neither hideous nor charmless.

01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:45.756
They are in fact beautiful,

01:07:46.397 --> 01:07:49.239
welcoming. Enchanting, even.

01:07:49.339 --> 01:07:51.156
- You got that, right?
- I did.

01:07:51.256 --> 01:07:53.167
I'm gonna go.

01:07:53.267 --> 01:07:55.637
Oh, do you wanna get high?

01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:57.638
Where are my people?

01:07:57.738 --> 01:07:59.704
This is wrong.

01:08:00.274 --> 01:08:02.776
Can you see it, Jackie,
how wrong it all is?

01:08:02.876 --> 01:08:05.481
- You can see it, right? She sees it.
- Hello, Jackie.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:08.758
- What are you saying is wrong?
- I'm not your lover.

01:08:08.858 --> 01:08:12.728
God. Ick. Just the choice
of words is so creepy.

01:08:12.828 --> 01:08:14.246
- I'm not your son.
- Angelo!

01:08:14.346 --> 01:08:17.625
- You're not my son now?
- I'm not your other son.

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:18.826
Is everything okay?

01:08:18.926 --> 01:08:21.212
- Why did you come over here?
- To say happy birthday.

01:08:21.312 --> 01:08:22.596
- It's your birthday?
- In a week.

01:08:22.697 --> 01:08:25.466
I wanted to be near you. Steal a whiff.

01:08:25.566 --> 01:08:29.804
What's the idea here? That if he
were alive you'd be less weird?

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:31.471
- Son...
- If your mother had been nicer?

01:08:31.572 --> 01:08:33.193
- Son... Son!
- If your marriage hadn't...

01:08:33.292 --> 01:08:35.393
Bad things happen.

01:08:35.493 --> 01:08:37.526
In a life.

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:40.648
Do it, Jackie.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:43.582
- Do what?
- You know.

01:08:43.683 --> 01:08:48.055
He should be here. I'm sorry he's not.
I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry for me.

01:08:48.154 --> 01:08:50.225
- Is there anything I can do?
- You don't want to get high, do you?

01:08:50.325 --> 01:08:51.359
- Do it.
- Do what?

01:08:51.459 --> 01:08:54.895
- We're going to let you two have some time.
- Why, because this doesn't involve you?

01:08:54.995 --> 01:08:56.279
- Both of you?
- It doesn't.

01:08:56.379 --> 01:08:59.600
- Most people by the time they're your age...
- Fuck you!

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.471
Fuck each and every last
one of you. Not you.

01:09:04.572 --> 01:09:06.564
It's very popular around here...

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:08.809
to think that I don't want him
to find a woman to be with.

01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:13.042
They won't say it, but it's true,
but they think it's a blame thing. What?

01:09:13.142 --> 01:09:14.548
That's an allusion
to how it was your fault.

01:09:14.648 --> 01:09:17.384
- The mother? Of course it's my fault.
- What were you doing?

01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:19.185
- You said you had him.
- I had him.

01:09:19.286 --> 01:09:23.020
I'm just asking what you were doing
that you needed to step away.

01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:26.219
I don't know.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.446
Nothing.

01:09:29.129 --> 01:09:31.965
Ten things, probably.

01:09:33.765 --> 01:09:35.669
But I must've stepped away.

01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:38.938
It's not that you stepped away.

01:09:39.037 --> 01:09:41.975
It's that if it hadn't happened,
he'd be here right now,

01:09:42.075 --> 01:09:45.779
feeling that the one stupid thing
you were doing isn't enough for you.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.962
He would?

01:09:51.783 --> 01:09:54.840
And what would you tell him,
if that's how someone made him feel?

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:58.002
I'd tell him that that someone
would rather die...

01:09:58.102 --> 01:10:00.034
than sit still,

01:10:00.393 --> 01:10:03.395
than be with one thing.

01:10:04.164 --> 01:10:06.298
One son.

01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:10.052
If that person wanted to be near me,

01:10:11.971 --> 01:10:15.942
I'd stay very, very far away,

01:10:16.042 --> 01:10:18.610
and I wouldn't come back.

01:11:31.851 --> 01:11:34.287
- High!
- Hi.

01:11:34.387 --> 01:11:36.857
No, are you high?

01:11:36.957 --> 01:11:39.991
Now that you're a woman that partakes?

01:11:41.327 --> 01:11:44.426
No, I'm just unable to do it.

01:11:47.333 --> 01:11:49.634
Do you have other kids?

01:11:50.803 --> 01:11:54.140
- It's sort of a long...
- He's mad.

01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:57.376
He seemed mad.

01:11:57.476 --> 01:12:00.780
You were once a 20 year old male person.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.350
What did you want?

01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:05.635
To get laid.

01:12:05.735 --> 01:12:09.688
Anything else?
What did you want from your mother?

01:12:10.256 --> 01:12:12.319
For her to want nothing from me.

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:19.473
It's a beautiful day.

01:12:21.201 --> 01:12:22.768
You're hot.

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:25.304
No.

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:31.178
- Say it again?
- You are hot.

01:12:31.878 --> 01:12:34.849
If I was going to really
hook up with somebody,

01:12:34.949 --> 01:12:36.517
you'd be...

01:12:36.617 --> 01:12:39.420
Well, I... I don't know how you'd be.
Awesome, probably.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.989
Really, do you think I'd be awesome?

01:12:42.089 --> 01:12:43.555
Yes.

01:12:45.558 --> 01:12:49.161
Unless, relationships are not...

01:12:49.261 --> 01:12:52.550
- And I hope you didn't think...
- Just use me for my body till I dump you.

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:54.382
Okay.

01:13:07.714 --> 01:13:09.916
And to live her life.

01:13:10.016 --> 01:13:11.383
What?

01:13:12.652 --> 01:13:14.487
My mother...

01:13:14.887 --> 01:13:18.356
she had some bad things
happen in her life.

01:13:21.027 --> 01:13:22.625
You have bad things happen?

01:13:26.599 --> 01:13:29.090
World's full of bad things.

01:13:30.069 --> 01:13:31.885
What did you want her to do?

01:13:35.708 --> 01:13:38.486
I wanted her to love it anyway.

01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.219
Jackie?

01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:15.853
Did you do it?

01:18:16.622 --> 01:18:19.426
- Did I...
- Whatever you needed to do in New York?

01:18:19.526 --> 01:18:21.727
Whatever... did you get it done?

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:25.029
- Yes, I did.
- Nice.

01:18:25.665 --> 01:18:27.932
Yes, it was.

01:18:28.568 --> 01:18:30.583
So lucky, aren't we?

01:18:32.071 --> 01:18:35.721
- We are. So lucky.
- Yeah.

01:18:37.577 --> 01:18:39.523
That's a nice one.

01:18:41.314 --> 01:18:43.247
Right?

01:18:51.056 --> 01:18:52.803
- Man, I wish I were you.
- No kidding.

01:18:52.903 --> 01:18:55.762
Everyone will be out of the ocean
a week from now. It'll be all yours.

01:18:55.862 --> 01:18:57.831
Do you wish you were me?

01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:00.058
No, I like it.

01:19:00.158 --> 01:19:03.337
Good teachers, lame teachers,
the boring reading, all of it.

01:19:03.437 --> 01:19:05.341
You'll have fun though.

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:09.759
You can live like, what's his name,
your surf guy. That can be you.

01:19:10.576 --> 01:19:14.612
- It was a fun summer.
- It really was.

01:19:31.765 --> 01:19:32.896
Thank you.

01:19:51.751 --> 01:19:54.019
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

01:19:54.119 --> 01:19:57.121
- I'm dialing you.
- I'm dialing you too.

01:20:02.361 --> 01:20:06.130
I would like to see you.
Can I make a time to see you?

01:20:07.966 --> 01:20:11.970
<i>If I told you where to meet me,
would you come here?</i>

01:20:26.486 --> 01:20:29.087
- He's here.
- Gotcha.

01:20:44.837 --> 01:20:49.774
- Hey, I think we met before. Ian.
- Right, hey. How you doing?

01:20:50.676 --> 01:20:54.606
- Is my mom here?
- I think I saw her.

01:20:55.548 --> 01:20:56.939
Is that her?

01:22:08.487 --> 01:22:10.555
What's up?

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.665
The most dangerous part of surfing
is entering and exiting the water.

01:22:19.765 --> 01:22:21.849
Yes, it is.

01:22:22.802 --> 01:22:24.561
It is.

01:22:26.605 --> 01:22:29.740
- Jackie.
- Happy birthday.

01:22:30.342 --> 01:22:34.378
- Don't you have a job?
- I was fired.

01:22:35.013 --> 01:22:38.615
Turns out if you just stop
answering your phone...

01:22:39.552 --> 01:22:41.458
So listen.

01:22:42.254 --> 01:22:44.290
There's no way else to say this.

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:46.872
There's no way
you're not going to hate it.

01:22:46.972 --> 01:22:50.035
In fact, I don't think there's any way you're
gonna do anything other than scream at me

01:22:50.135 --> 01:22:52.932
and forbid me from doing it,

01:22:53.032 --> 01:22:55.451
but I'm staying.

01:22:55.868 --> 01:22:58.603
- Staying where?
- In Los Angeles.

01:22:59.471 --> 01:23:02.875
There's no point in talking
about collective IQ.

01:23:02.975 --> 01:23:05.111
There's no sport in it.

01:23:05.211 --> 01:23:08.548
By the time you drive to a museum
you've lost the will to look at a painting,

01:23:08.648 --> 01:23:10.999
so it's hardly a decision
based on culture,

01:23:12.084 --> 01:23:14.485
but I'm staying.

01:23:14.787 --> 01:23:16.021
Here.

01:23:18.757 --> 01:23:20.389
I'm going to say something.

01:23:21.593 --> 01:23:26.689
And I don't care if you believe me,
because I'll prove it to be true.

01:23:28.467 --> 01:23:30.907
You don't have to see me.

01:23:31.303 --> 01:23:34.607
I'll be here. If I see you somewhere,
if I run into you,

01:23:34.707 --> 01:23:38.344
I'll say hello and let you go
on your way.

01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:42.382
You know I'd give everything I might ever
hope to have to spend time with you,

01:23:42.482 --> 01:23:44.949
but if you don't want that...

01:23:46.785 --> 01:23:48.853
it's okay.

01:23:52.908 --> 01:23:54.980
I just need nothing.

01:23:55.928 --> 01:23:59.999
Do you mean you need something,
or that you don't need anything?

01:24:00.099 --> 01:24:03.067
Being here is corrupting
your English, Jackie.

01:24:04.136 --> 01:24:06.563
I need nothing.

01:24:07.039 --> 01:24:09.640
The nothing that is here.

01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:13.777
- So...
- I'm going back.

01:24:14.046 --> 01:24:16.382
I begged the school.

01:24:16.882 --> 01:24:19.985
Blamed it on you, which seemed to work.

01:24:20.085 --> 01:24:22.553
They're taking me back.

01:24:23.555 --> 01:24:25.923
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:24:27.493 --> 01:24:29.170
Good luck.

01:24:31.029 --> 01:24:35.132
- It's okay, you can say you'll miss me.
- I'll miss you so much.

01:24:38.569 --> 01:24:41.673
You know, I've pissed away
a good amount of our money here.

01:24:41.773 --> 01:24:46.777
Was your father on board with this
crazy school thing you're wanting to do?

01:24:47.746 --> 01:24:51.415
- He is.
- What did he say?

01:24:51.951 --> 01:24:54.401
Whatever makes me happy.

01:24:55.387 --> 01:24:57.754
How does he do that?

01:25:00.092 --> 01:25:02.526
I don't want to live to work.

01:25:06.665 --> 01:25:10.703
- Okay.
- I will see you. I'll be around.

01:25:10.803 --> 01:25:13.137
You'll go there.

01:25:14.373 --> 01:25:16.403
Life is long.

01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:19.550
It is.

01:25:21.646 --> 01:25:23.866
What was the idea...

01:25:23.966 --> 01:25:26.318
for the end of the story?

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:28.688
That she jumps.

01:25:28.788 --> 01:25:31.092
And she falls.

01:25:32.391 --> 01:25:34.862
And nothing catches her.

01:25:34.962 --> 01:25:37.973
And she cracks her head open and dies.

01:25:40.104 --> 01:25:42.694
It might need a little work.

01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:47.907
- Carry your board?
- Thank you, Angelo.

01:25:48.007 --> 01:25:50.229
You got it, kidget.

01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:53.692
Did you bring your board?
