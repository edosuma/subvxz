That was the fun part.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.191
The disturbing part is
what Mr. Lissol uncovered.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.278
Just this evening, Dalia
accepted his friend request.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.572
Look at her feed
over the past two days.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.157
"Watched Tessa eat
an unborn chicken. LOL."

09:35.199 --> 09:38.786
"Watched Tessa eat her
salad like a boss. LOL"

09:38.828 --> 09:42.498
She's broadcasting every single
thing she does with you.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.167
- But why?
- Don't know.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.836
I can tell you
who intends to find out.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.504
- Lars Lissol.
- Yeah.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.423
Thanks, Lisa, but I don't
think that we need

09:50.464 --> 09:52.300
to drag an imaginary person
into this.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.552
I'll just ask Dalia what's up.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.096
It's not like she's hiding it.
It's on the Internet.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.431
I'll let you know
what she says. Okay?

09:58.472 --> 09:59.932
Okay, so I guess
I'll just tell Lars

09:59.974 --> 10:02.018
that his services
will no longer be needed.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.185
Although I can tell you
right now

10:03.227 --> 10:05.313
he would've appreciated
a thank you.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.944
Lookin' good, daddy.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.654
Ugh.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.197
Everything looks so heavy.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.324
Uh, excuse me.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.993
Sir, uh, do you
have a-a printout

10:19.035 --> 10:20.995
of the calorie count
entrees?

10:21.037 --> 10:24.165
- We most certainly do not.
- Oh. Okay.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.250
Well, can you at least
ask the kitchen how much butter

10:26.292 --> 10:28.002
they intend to put
in this pan-seared salmon?

10:28.044 --> 10:29.420
'You think you're ordering
something healthy'

10:29.462 --> 10:31.213
'cause it's a fish,
and then by the time

10:31.255 --> 10:32.840
they sneak all that butter
in there, you've got this--

10:32.882 --> 10:35.760
I'll go check
on the undercover butter agenda.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.181
- George.
- Yeah?

10:40.222 --> 10:41.515
(Dallas)
'What's up?'

10:41.557 --> 10:44.685
You just seem
a little...annoying.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.354
Well, yeah, I'm just trying
to shred up, you know?

10:46.395 --> 10:49.565
I've got my, my big photo shoot
in a couple of days, so..

10:49.607 --> 10:52.443
Photo shoot? Is this
about that silly calendar?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.654
Ye-yes, it's about
that silly calendar.

10:54.695 --> 10:58.407
Per your suggestion,
I am having a silly good time.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.744
Well, you seem to be taking
the silliness pretty seriously.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.288
Well, th-that's because I
happen to be

11:04.330 --> 11:06.040
in the running for December.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.958
You seem fidgety.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.460
Yeah, that's
'cause I'm fidgeting.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.586
It's a great way
to burn calories.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.754
I've been fidgeting for days

11:11.796 --> 11:12.880
and it's like

11:12.922 --> 11:14.465
hello, cheekbones. Ha ha ha.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.884
[instrumental music]

11:20.262 --> 11:22.390
[instrumental music]

11:22.431 --> 11:23.849
Hey. Carmen let me in.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.643
I figured you wouldn't mind
since we're

11:25.685 --> 11:28.062
such good friends these days.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.814
- LOL.
- I'm tweeting that.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.524
Dalia..

11:31.565 --> 11:33.401
...what is going on?

11:33.442 --> 11:35.403
I knew it was weird
when you started

11:35.444 --> 11:36.862
being nice to me
all of a sudden

11:36.904 --> 11:38.656
but I have no idea
why you are

11:38.698 --> 11:42.493
tweeting and posting every
stupid interaction we have

11:42.535 --> 11:43.911
for the whole world to see.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.955
So I guess
you want the true-true

11:45.996 --> 11:48.749
as they say in my
favorite movie "Cloud Atlas"

11:48.791 --> 11:51.752
featuring Tom Hanks playing,
like, 17 different roles.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.838
Yes. Give me the true-true.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.715
'Kay.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.801
Jenna Werner and I
used to be really good friends.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.886
I said true-true.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.221
Seriously, Tessa.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.098
Her and I were mad tight

12:04.140 --> 12:07.560
and then she, like,
turned on a dollar

12:07.601 --> 12:09.437
and ditched me.

12:09.478 --> 12:13.107
I think her Brown friends
thought she was too good for me.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.651
And when I saw you guys
hanging out, I..

12:17.027 --> 12:18.821
You got jealous.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.991
And I wanted her to think that I
was good friends with you, too.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.784
Look, Dalia..

12:23.826 --> 12:25.578
...if you wanna
be friends with me

12:25.619 --> 12:29.540
you don't have to be
weird about it or force it.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.918
I mean...I can..

12:32.960 --> 12:34.920
...imagine..

12:34.962 --> 12:38.299
...one day us being..

12:38.340 --> 12:40.718
...friend-like.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.804
Thanks, Tessa.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.806
That means a lot to me.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.230
Since you and I
are so close now

12:53.272 --> 12:55.274
will you do me a favor?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.026
Sure.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.069
Will you not be friends
with Jenna anymore?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.115
I can't believe
the movie's sold out.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.658
What else should we see?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.035
You know what?

13:06.076 --> 13:09.622
I'm rethinking the whole
movie idea in general.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.332
I can't stop picturing
my metabolism

13:11.373 --> 13:13.000
just plummeting in there.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.752
Can't we just go for a jog?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.837
You could sit on my back
while I do push-ups.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.298
I'm tired of sittin'
on your damn back, George!

13:19.340 --> 13:20.716
You know, all this
body conscious stuff

13:20.758 --> 13:22.259
is super unappealing.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.428
And ever since it started,
I can't help wishing

13:24.470 --> 13:26.013
you'd get hit by a car.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.307
Really? Hit by a car?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.976
Well, I'm not proud of it,
George, but that's how I feel.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.605
You know what,
I think you're just mad

13:34.647 --> 13:37.399
because the ladies
are checking me out.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.068
The ladies
are checking you out

13:39.109 --> 13:40.736
because you're wearing
a garbage bag.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.448
Hey, you have nothing
to be jealous of, sugar.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.908
Should probably come up
with a different nickname

13:45.950 --> 13:48.369
'cause I'm watching my intake.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.831
Bye. Be careful crossin'.
Or don't.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.083
[instrumental music]

13:55.501 --> 13:57.336
So how's the groove been
now that Jenna's back?

13:57.378 --> 13:58.462
Her and Opus
getting along?

13:58.504 --> 14:01.340
Opus lights up
whenever she.. Hey.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.550
You trying to distract
me with chitchat?

14:02.591 --> 14:03.592
I'm in my zone right now.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.135
I will not be thrown from it!

14:05.177 --> 14:07.179
Alright, that's fine, man,
'cause I'm in the zone, too.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.515
Alright? I'm in
the exact same zone.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.475
Frederick.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.185
So when do they tell us
what month we get?

14:13.227 --> 14:15.563
Oh! First, they make us
work for it.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.399
[music continues]

14:19.650 --> 14:20.985
[song on player]

14:21.026 --> 14:24.405
Let me see you
work that sausage, George.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.657
'It's there for a reason.'

14:26.699 --> 14:28.492
Use it!

14:28.534 --> 14:30.035
'Surf's up, Noah.'

14:30.077 --> 14:31.912
Surf's all the way up.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.414
Oh, yeah!

14:33.455 --> 14:34.748
[instrumental music]

14:34.790 --> 14:36.917
'That is romance, Fred.'

14:36.959 --> 14:40.796
Oh, my heavens.
You are not shy.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.592
Alright, boys,
now, I just want you

14:44.633 --> 14:47.136
to have fun, okay?
Get silly.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.929
Alright! Now, come on,
why don't you give me

14:48.971 --> 14:51.473
a little butt-to-butt?

14:51.515 --> 14:54.810
Come on. Don't be shy.
Just a little butt-to-butt.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.604
Don't worry.
These are just for me.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.063
Yeah!

14:58.105 --> 14:59.565
Oh, that's fun.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.233
Part of me
is excited to get back

15:01.275 --> 15:03.152
but part of me
feels bad leaving Opus

15:03.193 --> 15:05.154
in the middle of all this
divorce drama.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.488
But what am I gonna do, right?

15:06.530 --> 15:08.616
I mean, the kid's
gonna have issues.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.992
Yeah.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.661
I guess nobody
gets out unscathed, right?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.122
Speaking of which

15:15.164 --> 15:18.292
can I talk to you
about Dalia Royce?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.710
I know this is gonna
be hard to believe

15:19.752 --> 15:22.546
because of how she acts,
but I think

15:22.588 --> 15:25.341
she still wants
to be friends with you.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.426
Yeah, but that never works.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.929
It's always awkward
trying to be friends with an ex.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.765
What?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.893
Dalia and I used to hook up.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.354
What?

15:38.395 --> 15:40.147
Two Thanksgivings ago
was the first time.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.523
[instrumental music]

15:41.565 --> 15:43.692
(Jenna)
It was more of a hate hook-up.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.780
Say it. Say it.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.448
You go to Brown.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.451
[music continues]

15:52.493 --> 15:55.162
It happened a couple more times
before I broke things off.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.748
She's been a total head case
ever since

15:57.790 --> 16:00.501
sending me pictures
of her weird little boyfriend.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.379
Did you know she got his face
tattooed on her crack?

16:04.296 --> 16:06.298
Above her crack, actually.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.676
- I was there.
- Figures.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.010
I knew when she saw me
hanging out with you

16:10.052 --> 16:11.887
she'd try to use you next.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.348
She's the most
vindictive person I know.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.226
All she cares about is hurting
the people who hurt her.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.728
So just be careful around her.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.854
[door opens]

16:20.896 --> 16:23.857
[instrumental music]

16:28.529 --> 16:30.114
(Tessa)
Dalia and Jenna
used to hook up?

16:30.155 --> 16:32.992
It was crazy,
but also weirdly made sense.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.452
Suddenly I understood
Dalia's lesbian jokes

16:35.494 --> 16:37.538
for what they were,
a deflection.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.540
Are you guys talking about me?

16:41.208 --> 16:45.421
Jenna...told me...
everything.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.173
And I-I just want you to know
that there is..

16:48.215 --> 16:49.883
...no judgment.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.510
Thanks, Tessa.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.429
You're a true friend.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.431
I'm really glad
you feel that way.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.558
And look, I've had
some bad breakups, too.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.601
I mean, who hasn't?

16:59.643 --> 17:02.938
But sometimes I think
it's best to just move on.

17:02.980 --> 17:06.734
- I think you'll feel better--
- Thanks, Tessa. I know.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.153
You really helped
clear things up for me.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.240
I really, really owe you one.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.621
Yeah. If I were you,
I'd move.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.376
[indistinct chattering]

17:25.919 --> 17:27.504
So..

17:27.546 --> 17:29.590
This is it.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.217
This is it.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.886
Moments from now,
I'll know whether or not

17:33.927 --> 17:35.345
I'm too sexy for my shirt

17:35.387 --> 17:37.389
which I suspect I am not.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.766
Well..

17:38.807 --> 17:40.726
It's only 'cause it's
a pretty sexy shirt.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.186
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.188
- It's rayon.
- Oh.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.274
I'd like to thank
all the dads for their help.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.692
Because of you,
we expect to have

17:48.734 --> 17:51.028
a record-breaking year
for our charity

17:51.070 --> 17:54.406
mothers against the defamation
of undiluted apple juice.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.657
[clapping]

17:55.699 --> 17:57.242
What, what,
that's the charity?

17:57.284 --> 17:58.619
- Mm-hmm.
- Apple juice?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.662
This year's Decemberfold
represents everything

18:00.704 --> 18:02.456
we look for at Maduap.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.250
Sexiness, hunkability
and a belief

18:05.292 --> 18:07.920
in unrestrained fructose.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.547
Get on with it!
Let's see the man meat!

18:10.589 --> 18:12.758
(female #1)
'Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for the guy'

18:12.800 --> 18:15.302
we wanna see two pages of

18:15.344 --> 18:17.221
George Altman!

18:17.262 --> 18:18.680
[all clapping]

18:18.722 --> 18:20.682
[laughing]
Hey!

18:20.724 --> 18:21.850
Aha!

18:21.892 --> 18:23.393
Well, thank you.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.688
Yes! Thank you! Thanks!

18:26.730 --> 18:28.398
Oh, that, look at that.
That's nice.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.275
- 'Well done.'
- 'Really great photo.'

18:30.317 --> 18:33.612
You did it, buddy. Every man
in Chatswin wants to be you.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.824
Every woman in Chatswin
wants to be with you.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.660
