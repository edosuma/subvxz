00:27.790 --> 00:31.590
Inspired by a true story

01:37.080 --> 01:39.540
Joan Elizabeth Stanley,
you are resident at this address?

01:39.580 --> 01:42.750
Special Branch, you are under arrest!/
What's going on?!

01:42.750 --> 01:45.750
You are being charged with 27 breaches
of the official secrets act..

01:45.750 --> 01:47.500
..you must come with us now.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.830
<i>In other news,
The investigation is continuing...</i>

02:08.870 --> 02:12.660
<i>...into the death of the former head of the Foreign Office,
Sir William Mitchell...</i>

02:12.700 --> 02:15.410
<i>...a statement will be made to Parliament on Friday.</i>

02:53.290 --> 02:55.000
Sit here, please.

03:03.580 --> 03:07.130
I don't want a lawyer.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.170
I haven't done anything wrong.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.490
Mrs. Stanley, you are being charged with treason!

03:12.000 --> 03:12.540
What?!

03:12.540 --> 03:16.290
Unless you can prove to the contrary,
your name will be released to the House of Commons on Friday.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.540
Why?

03:18.750 --> 03:22.000
There is a case against Sir William Mitchell,
which strongly implicates you.

03:22.450 --> 03:25.280
If you are going to present a defense,
then you must do it before Friday.

03:25.540 --> 03:28.250
I have nothing to defend!/
There's a file on you.

03:28.290 --> 03:32.040
Starting in 1938,
when you went to Cambridge University.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.660
Mrs. Stanley?

04:28.700 --> 04:31.030
My room is on the third floor.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.620
I can't climb that high!

04:36.160 --> 04:38.990
I have been out on the razzle.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.070
Are you also a <i>first year</i> ?

04:54.080 --> 04:57.880
English Literature?/
Natural Sciences, Physics

04:58.120 --> 05:00.370
I was fooled by your cushion covers.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.540
Modern languages.

05:02.950 --> 05:05.160
Can I borrow a dressing gown?

05:05.200 --> 05:09.950
If a bulldog catches me,
I can say we were drinking cocoa.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.920
Is that a mink?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.790
Hideous isn't it? My mothers cousin brought it by.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.710
No, it's not hideous..

05:29.160 --> 05:30.910
..it's different.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.460
I'll bring it back tomorrow.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.280
Thank you so much.

06:24.290 --> 06:25.920
Oh, wait a second.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.070
<i>Hello!</i>

06:30.870 --> 06:34.450
That's the girl I was telling you about.
I climbed into her window.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.580
It's all been a bit of a scramble.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.040
My mother was so busy ordering me my college trousseau, that..

06:58.330 --> 07:02.290
..we didn't buy any of the practical science equipment,
let alone the set texts.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.420
So, are your parents against you coming here?

07:05.450 --> 07:07.240
My father was delighted.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.490
Yours?

07:10.830 --> 07:12.210
I am an orphan.

07:13.370 --> 07:15.530
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.000
No, it happened a long time ago.

07:19.910 --> 07:22.410
Flu.. Russia..

07:24.790 --> 07:29.080
So I went to live with my cousin,
Leo, in Germany.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.790
He had just moved there.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.000
And when Leo came here, I followed him.

07:35.910 --> 07:39.490
He is a student here too?/
St. John's.

07:41.370 --> 07:46.490
You know? I guess I am just making up excuses,
why we are older than everybody else.

07:58.410 --> 08:02.160
Russia, Germany,
That's why modern languages.

08:02.870 --> 08:05.990
After the first three,
it all gets really easy.

08:08.370 --> 08:10.030
We're Jewish, by the way.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.710
I have never met ../
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

08:15.620 --> 08:16.870
Pardon?

08:19.830 --> 08:22.630
Would you like to come
to a film night with me tomorrow?

08:23.370 --> 08:26.620
I would love to, but I have
my tutor's sherry evening.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.070
Let's go!

08:42.330 --> 08:45.080
That's William!
...William Mitchell

08:45.120 --> 08:48.240
He's a viscount or something.

08:49.250 --> 08:53.420
Kharak is a Mahārāja./
Are we the only ones here without a title?

08:56.200 --> 08:59.910
William! Kharak!
Wonderful to see you.

09:05.830 --> 09:08.000
That's my cousin, Leo.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.960
Fancy for film night!/
Socialists can't have glamour?

09:25.160 --> 09:26.660
You must be Joan.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.700
I'm.. Leo

09:31.080 --> 09:33.210
Sonya says you saved her life.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.380
Not exactly.

09:38.290 --> 09:40.000
I hope you enjoy the film..

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
...Joan.

09:42.500 --> 09:55.000
<i>Beneath its shade we'll live and die,
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,
We'll keep the red flag flying here.</i>

10:18.580 --> 10:20.080
Mrs. Stanley?

10:21.910 --> 10:24.740
At Cambridge, you were known
to consort with Communists,

10:24.790 --> 10:26.920
and attend their meetings
and their film showings.

10:27.370 --> 10:31.870
Oh, is that what this is all about?
Everyone did it back then.

10:31.910 --> 10:35.990
Even if the films were dreadful!
Not that you could say it, but ...

10:36.450 --> 10:38.160
It was the <i>in</i> thing.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.870
The world was so different then.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.420
You have no idea.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.040
So, tell me, Mrs. Stanley..

10:47.450 --> 10:50.620
Would you describe your father as a socialist?

10:51.750 --> 10:53.250
Goodness!

10:54.620 --> 10:57.660
Well, he was a headmaster.

10:58.870 --> 11:00.780
He cared for the ordinary man.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.670
He'd seen the Gyro marches
pass through the town.

11:04.040 --> 11:07.750
But a socialist? No!/
So, who politicized you, then?

11:08.290 --> 11:10.380
That's a peculiar way of putting it.

11:10.410 --> 11:15.160
My family escaped anti-Semitism
in Russia to settle in Germany

11:16.330 --> 11:18.330
It was not the best decision.

11:18.870 --> 11:24.950
By the time I was at university,
Hitler's thugs were unstoppable.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.960
But I would not hide from them.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.670
Not because I was a hero!
But because if I did not stand up to them, who would?

11:33.700 --> 11:36.200
<i>Well said, sir</i>./
My small action..

11:36.250 --> 11:40.540
could join with a small action of another
until we had a movement!

11:41.580 --> 11:42.710
<i>Yes.</i>/
<i>That's right, yes.</i>

11:42.750 --> 11:44.080
Compelling, isn't it?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.820
<i>All of us have to decide..</i>

11:46.820 --> 11:48.820
..which side we are on.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.780
<i>Yes!</i>/
Warmonger!

11:50.830 --> 11:54.000
<i>Let him speak.</i>/
The war has already begun,

11:54.580 --> 11:57.420
While they are saying "Peace at all costs".

11:57.450 --> 12:00.370
We are being dragged
into the future by dark forces.

12:00.410 --> 12:02.660
We have to stand together.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.880
Banish our enemies of apathy and hatred.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.240
Rally our allies of hope!

12:10.290 --> 12:10.880
<i>- Yes!</i>

12:10.910 --> 12:13.320
<i>Courage and honor</i>

12:13.700 --> 12:15.700
- Take action!
<i>Yes!</i>

12:15.750 --> 12:18.000
Join us!/
<i>Yes!</i>

12:20.200 --> 12:22.160
Great speech, Leo./
Well done, old man.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.120
They tried to drown him, you know.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.910
The Nazis?/
They beat him up..

12:29.500 --> 12:31.380
..and threw him off a bridge.

12:34.290 --> 12:35.580
What did you think?

12:36.410 --> 12:38.240
Very moving./
Moving?

12:38.290 --> 12:41.460
I wanted it to be rousing!/
<i>Extremely good show, Leo!</i>

12:41.500 --> 12:43.790
Thank you./
Yes, well done, old chap.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.130
If I hadn't already,
I'd sign up on the spot.

12:58.580 --> 13:02.000
<i>It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.</i>

13:04.330 --> 13:09.080
It was the age of wisdom.
It was the age of foolishness.

13:09.620 --> 13:14.450
It was the epoch of belief.
It was the epoch of incredulity.

13:15.370 --> 13:20.240
It was the season of light.
It was the season of darkness.

13:20.950 --> 13:25.740
The tale of two cities, book one.
Recalled to life!

13:25.790 --> 13:29.040
That's communism./
That's Dickens.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.320
And I thought far too English for you.

13:34.410 --> 13:37.280
So, what made you want
to read physics?

13:37.580 --> 13:42.920
The clever answer is, when in 1932,
they discovered the Neutron..

13:43.660 --> 13:46.910
..and the whole world changed,
and I wanted to be a part of that.

13:48.330 --> 13:51.080
But the reality is..
tadpoles.

13:52.330 --> 13:57.000
When my sister and I were little, we used to go down
to our local pond, and take them home with us.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.450
They were a bit smelly,
so we gave them a nice hot bath..

14:02.080 --> 14:03.920
..and accidentally boiled them alive!

14:03.950 --> 14:06.200
You are a monster!/
<i>- No!</i>

14:07.330 --> 14:09.380
It made me want to understand.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.460
And now I'm here studying physics.

14:16.410 --> 14:18.660
I want to show you something.

14:20.410 --> 14:21.870
Let's go!

14:26.750 --> 14:28.080
This way.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.740
Tell me, if all of this..

15:08.370 --> 15:10.660
Whole world is going to be destroyed..

15:11.370 --> 15:13.030
What would you save?

15:15.910 --> 15:17.410
The Pyramids.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.380
The Eiffel Tower, perhaps?/
Why those things?

15:21.870 --> 15:23.820
Why any of them?

15:25.200 --> 15:29.870
Maybe it's a chance to rebuild
a civilization from scratch.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.240
A completely new way.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.630
My little Comrade.

15:56.370 --> 15:58.280
See you at the meeting?

16:22.450 --> 16:23.620
<i> Mrs. Stanley?</i>

16:23.660 --> 16:28.240
<i>I, Zinoviev, would like to repeat,
that I am fully and utterly guilty..</i>

16:28.910 --> 16:34.740
I am guilty of having been the organizer,
second only to Trotsky of the attempted killing of Stalin.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.880
Do you think Stalin forced him to confess?

16:40.910 --> 16:43.410
Of course not!
These confessions are freely given.

16:43.790 --> 16:46.000
The only people who claim otherwise,
are members of the Western press,

16:46.040 --> 16:47.630
out to discredit the USSR.

16:47.660 --> 16:51.120
But surely you can see why they say
some of the confessions aren't credible.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.870
Who is they?/
Most people in England.

16:52.910 --> 16:58.450
Then they are playing into the hands of criminals,
and enemies of the state who plant confusion.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.990
The final words of his co-conspirator,
Kamenev, say it all:

17:03.040 --> 17:06.170
"Whatever my sentence may be, I consider it just ..."

17:06.200 --> 17:10.780
... together with the people,
follow where Stalin leads!"

17:11.369 --> 17:12.700
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:23.910 --> 17:26.740
How funny!
About you and Leo.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.290
What about us?

17:30.700 --> 17:33.570
Are you sleeping together?/
Sonya!

17:33.950 --> 17:35.950
What are you waiting for?

17:37.870 --> 17:39.660
You will laugh but..

17:41.910 --> 17:44.450
I think people should be in love.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.040
See?

17:47.870 --> 17:50.530
You silly goose!
Love?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.740
This isn't how Leo works.

17:52.790 --> 17:56.000
If you wait for him to loves you,
you'll die a virgin.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.570
Anyway,
it doesn't matter now, does it?

17:58.830 --> 18:00.330
What do you mean?

18:01.120 --> 18:04.530
He's going next week./
Where?

18:18.160 --> 18:21.740
Russia?
For three months?

18:22.160 --> 18:23.990
We can write.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.370
No, I think it's a wonderful opportunity.

18:27.410 --> 18:32.990
I'm giving a lecture, and then I'll be taken
on a tour of the factories for my thesis.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.380
Leo..

18:37.160 --> 18:38.700
I'll miss you.

18:45.830 --> 18:48.000
My little Comrade!

19:21.250 --> 19:24.170
Hello! Mum?

19:26.200 --> 19:27.530
Mum!

19:30.660 --> 19:33.700
There you are!
Listen, I've heard the strangest thing.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.380
I have been calling you.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.830
Is your Sciatica back?

19:41.750 --> 19:43.670
I got a call in chambers.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.870
It's a tip-off from the CPS,

19:45.910 --> 19:48.450
who'd somehow heard this from MI-5.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.210
It's utterly ridiculous;
you will laugh.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.380
I don't supposed you've heard
about a man called Sir William Mitchell.

19:53.410 --> 19:55.070
Who died recently?

19:57.200 --> 20:01.160
Well, they think he was a communist.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.280
And might have been part of some Cambridge spy ring.

20:04.330 --> 20:08.380
But that is not the funny part, this is:
they think you might be involved.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.710
That's nonsense, isn't it?
Isn't it?

20:22.500 --> 20:24.080
What's the matter?

20:31.450 --> 20:33.120
What have they done to you?

20:33.700 --> 20:37.570
It's like a nightmare.
I can't believe it's happening, Nick.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.330
They put me under a control hood./
What?

20:41.370 --> 20:44.240
Sir William.
I knew him at Cambridge.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.740
We were there at the same time.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.330
This is an absolute disgrace.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.490
I'll talk to Bernard directly,
I'll take them to the bloody cleaners.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.880
How dare they put that thing on you?

21:01.580 --> 21:05.790
<i>The Home Office has announced,
 that all foreign nationals must report immediately,</i>

21:05.830 --> 21:07.250
<i>with their passports</i>

21:07.290 --> 21:09.790
<i>to their local police station for registration...</i>

21:12.200 --> 21:15.280
Darling!

21:16.750 --> 21:20.250
So sorry I am late!
You know what Alistair can be like?

21:20.290 --> 21:24.710
Alistair? I thought it was Angus./
Former was Angus.

21:25.330 --> 21:28.880
This is Alistair./
<i>Afternoon! What would you like, Ma'am?</i>

21:29.250 --> 21:31.710
Tea and a crumpet, please.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.540
Coffee, please.

21:34.790 --> 21:38.540
Have you heard from Leo?
<i>I have not heard a word for weeks!</i>

21:38.870 --> 21:41.910
They will let him back in, won't they?

21:41.950 --> 21:45.660
Don't worry about Leo.
Our passports make it difficult for us.

21:45.700 --> 21:50.070
But he can be very persuasive./
This is war, Sonya!

21:50.410 --> 21:53.740
His beloved Stalin is cahoots
with the Nazis who tried to kill him.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.460
You mean the pact?

21:55.750 --> 22:01.000
That's just tactics to buy us time./
Not us; you!

22:01.500 --> 22:03.750
We are not on the same side anymore.

22:37.870 --> 22:39.370
JoJo!

22:40.540 --> 22:41.830
Leo!

22:49.700 --> 22:51.530
I missed you so much!

22:52.540 --> 22:54.000
Did you miss me?

22:54.500 --> 22:57.790
Yes, but not as much
 as the roast beef at the Eagle.

22:57.830 --> 22:59.500
You Rotter!/
 What?

23:01.160 --> 23:04.910
How did you get back in?/
I told them, I ...

23:04.950 --> 23:07.200
...had to finish my studies.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.290
But I might be on borrowed time.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.450
Communist International.
Comintern - that was the name of the group.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.990
I was never a member./
<i>Of the group?</i>

23:23.330 --> 23:25.500
Of anything!/
Why not?

23:26.660 --> 23:28.000
I didn't agree with what they said.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.910
When are you going to realize,
you are wasting your time?

23:29.910 --> 23:32.570
Because we're not;
are we, Mrs. Stanley?

23:37.160 --> 23:41.320
Leo Galich, you are being interned as an enemy alien
under the Emergency Powers Act.

23:41.370 --> 23:42.950
Come now./
He's on our side!

23:43.000 --> 23:45.130
Can I take anything?/
One case.

23:45.410 --> 23:47.320
Don't you know anything?
The Nazis tried to kill him.

23:47.370 --> 23:49.120
I have been expecting this.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.400
Do not make a scene./
Young lady, he's a German.

23:52.750 --> 23:54.420
Joan! Joan! Joan!

23:54.450 --> 23:57.660
Can we have a moment?/
We'll be outside.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.790
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

24:03.750 --> 24:06.580
Joan, Come on! come!

24:08.790 --> 24:12.040
Please, do not take this so hard.

24:12.290 --> 24:14.460
I can't bear it.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.380
This is not the Joan I know.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.530
When this is all over, we..

24:23.250 --> 24:25.000
..we will be together.

24:29.700 --> 24:32.620
<i>In 1940,
Sonya went to Switzerland ...</i>

24:32.660 --> 24:35.320
<i>... and Leo was interned briefly
on the Isle of Man.</i>

24:36.500 --> 24:41.210
I lost touch with him then./
<i>No, you corresponded regularly.</i>

24:41.750 --> 24:45.880
Right up until you started work
at the Tube Alloys project, in Cambridge in '41.

24:47.830 --> 24:50.790
<i>So, did Leo Galich get you that job?</i>

24:59.910 --> 25:01.570
Bag please, Miss.

25:03.370 --> 25:04.660
Joan Smith!

25:04.910 --> 25:07.410
Very Punctual!
I'm Max.

25:08.290 --> 25:09.920
Alright, follow me.

25:12.450 --> 25:14.120
You come highly recommended.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.320
First Class Certificate
in the natural sciences.

25:16.370 --> 25:18.870
Specializing in theoretical physics, Professor.

25:18.910 --> 25:22.200
We are going to be working with the Yanks here,
so just Max.

25:23.540 --> 25:26.330
Do you have any idea what we do here?/
No.

25:26.660 --> 25:29.370
I just had a letter telling me,
to report here for an interview.

25:30.040 --> 25:33.710
Yes! We recruit
by personal recommendation only.

25:37.910 --> 25:39.370
This way.

25:47.500 --> 25:51.250
I'm looking for a personal assistant.
Typing, filing, that sort of thing.

25:51.290 --> 25:54.130
But crucially,
someone who understands the science.

25:54.160 --> 25:58.070
Now, that's important because
you could be a party to everything that goes on here.

25:58.120 --> 26:04.530
So, before we go any further,
I'm going to need you to sign one of these.

26:04.580 --> 26:08.670
It's an undertaking,
that binds you to absolute secrecy.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.700
Do you have a pen?

26:19.410 --> 26:22.990
So, our name:
Tube Alloys

26:23.700 --> 26:25.490
Any idea what that means?

26:26.120 --> 26:31.370
I would assume you are developing
non-corrosive metals for oil drills or gas pipes?

26:32.250 --> 26:34.170
But I don't know how it fits in
with secret war work.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.950
Tube Alloys is a code name.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.790
Even some members of the Cabinet
don't know what we do.

26:40.950 --> 26:43.070
Am I allowed to know what you do?

26:44.120 --> 26:48.620
Our aim is to break the machine..

26:49.580 --> 26:52.210
..touch the ghost of matter./
And that means?

26:53.160 --> 26:54.820
After your probation.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.920
<i>The critical mass is less than anyone thought.</i>

27:15.950 --> 27:19.070
<i>That can't be right
235 with a radius..</i>

27:36.870 --> 27:40.070
I'm sure we'll get better a better answer,
as soon as we have the data on 235.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.450
But getting enough of the damn stuff is tough.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.630
Centrifuge?

27:46.500 --> 27:49.710
I'm so sorry; I studied gasses./
Say that again.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.990
I studied gases./
No, the other bit?

27:54.750 --> 27:58.210
Well, I'm sure you've already thought of this, but..

27:58.790 --> 28:03.790
..a centrifugal force could separate
a gaseous mixture of the two isotopes.

28:04.370 --> 28:07.990
That's good.
It's an interesting theory.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.700
Go and have a chat with Spencer about it.

28:20.540 --> 28:24.710
This is exactly why I wanted
a first class science graduate as an assistant..

28:24.750 --> 28:26.460
..and not a pretty face.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.120
I mean, of course..

28:29.450 --> 28:32.490
You're not... NOT a pretty face.

28:35.330 --> 28:38.210
Can we start again?/
Please do.

28:40.700 --> 28:45.700
Imagine if it were possible,
to separate the two isotopes.

28:45.950 --> 28:51.530
And you had a critical mass;
pure uranium 235 in isolation.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.620
One atom split.

28:55.370 --> 28:58.120
That would produce more neutrons.

28:58.700 --> 29:02.320
Then more Uranium nuclei would split.

29:02.370 --> 29:06.280
The result will be a self-sustaining chain reaction.

29:07.910 --> 29:10.030
A bomb?/
A super bomb.

29:10.750 --> 29:15.130
If we have a chance in hell of winning this damned war,
we have to beat the Germans to it.

29:16.120 --> 29:20.660
Now, I want you to read these summaries.

29:21.250 --> 29:25.420
See if you can create a basic diagram
for the laymen to understand.

29:25.450 --> 29:30.490
We don't have much time.
We have an important delegation arriving; not just scientists.

29:30.540 --> 29:33.540
Deputy Prime Minister Attlee,
as well as Sir James Chadwick.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.210
James Chadwick?/
<i>That's right!</i>

29:37.830 --> 29:40.210
Nobel prize winner for the discovery of the neutron?

29:40.250 --> 29:41.960
I hope you are good at drawing!

30:00.870 --> 30:04.990
Listen, if you want to make pictures
of the next phase, that would be good.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.740
Joan!

30:22.500 --> 30:24.830
William! Hello!

30:28.450 --> 30:30.780
You are a long way from the Foreign Office!

30:30.830 --> 30:34.330
I came to see my old tutor
before he pops his clogs.

30:36.580 --> 30:39.750
Have you heard from anyone?/
Leo writes.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.040
Sonya has my new address;
but no word.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.080
The cat that walks alone..

30:45.620 --> 30:48.820
Are you enjoying your job?/
Working in sciences is all I ever wanted to do.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.250
Which is exactly?/
Research.

30:52.290 --> 30:53.710
Into?

30:53.750 --> 30:57.080
You know I can't say./
Come on, Jojo.

31:01.080 --> 31:05.000
Now we've reconnected.
I could pop up next week?

31:05.040 --> 31:07.880
Maybe you could show me around your office?/
Laboratory!

31:07.910 --> 31:09.700
And we could have lunch?

31:09.950 --> 31:11.490
I can't!/
Come on!

31:11.540 --> 31:13.420
They are going to send me abroad any moment.

31:13.450 --> 31:15.950
We might not have much time./
William, I..

31:16.910 --> 31:18.950
I just have to say, that..

31:20.000 --> 31:23.130
I don't think of you that way./
What way?

31:23.790 --> 31:25.500
Husband material.

31:25.790 --> 31:28.250
God! Joan!

31:28.540 --> 31:32.130
I'm already spoken for.
Remember Kharak?

31:32.370 --> 31:34.370
We have been together for years.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.880
<i>So, William knew what you were doing
at Tube Alloys, didn't he?</i>

31:39.330 --> 31:44.000
<i>Did you tell him?</i>/
No, I didn't tell him! I did not tell anyone!

31:55.540 --> 31:57.580
Who is there, miss Smith?

31:58.500 --> 32:02.290
It's just my cousin, Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
He's here to..

32:02.330 --> 32:04.420
Make passionate love to me.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.130
Help me build a bookshelf.

32:09.250 --> 32:11.330
So, you can't even tell me the basics?

32:12.080 --> 32:15.330
No, I can't.
It's the rules.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.790
We are on the same side now.

32:18.830 --> 32:21.960
Even Churchill says so.
I am not telling you!

32:28.750 --> 32:30.330
I left the party.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.160
Did they make you?/
No.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.380
It's easier for Comintern.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.170
I can continue my work in Canada../
Canada?

32:42.200 --> 32:45.910
Not be considered a security risk./
You're going to Canada?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.750
I need your help.

32:52.620 --> 32:53.950
JoJo.

32:54.410 --> 32:57.700
That is why I'm here./
I thought you were here to see me.

33:01.250 --> 33:02.750
Come on.

33:05.330 --> 33:08.920
That goes without saying./
Well, try saying it sometimes!

33:14.000 --> 33:15.960
My little Comrade!

33:29.660 --> 33:32.240
When the USSR came into the war..

33:32.660 --> 33:36.450
Churchill promised that all
technological advancements would be shared.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.080
He has not kept that promise.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.280
We need documents..

33:42.250 --> 33:43.540
.. designs..

33:44.910 --> 33:46.240
..research..

33:48.370 --> 33:49.950
How do you know?

33:51.120 --> 33:54.200
About the project?/
It's nothing to do with you and me.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.950
It is about saving the revolution./
You want me to smuggle the research out?

34:00.410 --> 34:02.870
To steal it?/
No! No! No!

34:02.910 --> 34:06.410
To share it./
No, Leo! No, I won't!

34:06.450 --> 34:11.530
This new weapon is on a completely different level.
Is it not?

34:12.199 --> 34:14.239
Help us./
Absolutely not!

34:14.290 --> 34:17.630
Do you know, Jojo?
I really expected more from you!

34:19.540 --> 34:24.130
Do not you see that you are in a special position?

34:25.949 --> 34:28.239
You can change the world.

34:28.290 --> 34:31.750
No, for God's sake! I'm not one of your rallies!/
Jojo, listen!

34:31.790 --> 34:36.500
No, Leo, I won't! I won't do it!
You shouldn't have asked me!

34:37.250 --> 34:39.960
Just leave!
I've had enough!

34:48.830 --> 34:52.460
You are being principled and stubborn.

34:53.290 --> 34:56.250
No reason./
Just go!

35:17.580 --> 35:19.130
I have to take this!

35:22.330 --> 35:25.830
<i>Time is now 12:31, and this interview is suspended.</i>

35:34.830 --> 35:37.000
You never told me you worked on the bomb.

35:37.370 --> 35:41.530
I couldn't tell you.
I signed the Offical Secrets Act.

35:42.950 --> 35:46.030
I'm not angry, Mum.
I'm just surprised.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.910
I thought you were over-educated for a librarian.

35:51.790 --> 35:53.710
It's like I don't know you.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.700
I am your mother.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.280
Did you know what the bomb could do?

35:59.330 --> 36:03.170
We knew that we had to get it before Germany.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.450
Just imagine if they got it first.

36:05.790 --> 36:10.500
We knew we were doing something worthwhile.
You know, for the long term.

36:10.540 --> 36:13.420
The uses of its energy./
Did dad know?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.380
Yes, that's why we moved to Australia.

36:19.790 --> 36:22.000
I thought you met on the boat going over?

36:22.370 --> 36:27.240
Well, we did know each other beforehand, but..

36:27.750 --> 36:32.920
We thought it would be better, if we pretended../
Is anything you've ever told me actually true?

36:34.080 --> 36:36.750
Yes, everything relating to you.

36:55.700 --> 36:57.490
Deputy Prime Minister!
Professor Chadwick!

36:57.540 --> 36:59.830
This is Professor Edward,
Professor Jenkins,

37:00.160 --> 37:01.450
..good morning./
Good morning

37:01.500 --> 37:03.040
<i> Professor Thornau</i>./
Good morning.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.670
<i>Professor Holloway</i>./
Good morning.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.200
<i>And this is Donald Hastings</i>./
Good morning.

37:07.250 --> 37:10.420
He is in charge of quantitative and qualitative analysis.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.210
Are you in charge of the tea?

37:20.040 --> 37:21.670
You have come a long way.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.880
Not far enough, sir.
We need to build a reactor to breed Plutonium.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.700
The Canadians?/
Exactly.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.950
If we can share with them../
We need to go there.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.070
With your permission, sir?

37:38.290 --> 37:39.710
Agreed!

37:40.290 --> 37:43.750
If you succeed,
you understand what it means?

37:43.790 --> 37:45.960
A seat at the table..

37:46.750 --> 37:49.330
How will we sleep at night?

37:50.950 --> 37:53.780
At the moment, it's only intended as a deterrent.

37:53.830 --> 37:59.920
All the more reason to develop one of our own.
Otherwise the Yanks will control everything.

38:00.790 --> 38:02.540
We need one now..

38:02.790 --> 38:06.330
And we need it with a bloody Union Jack on top.

38:11.910 --> 38:13.410
Sonya!

38:14.290 --> 38:16.750
You're late, so the landlady let me in!

38:16.790 --> 38:19.580
It's lovely to see you!/
And you!

38:21.370 --> 38:23.160
Three years!

38:23.200 --> 38:27.200
Thanks for looking after my trunk!/
That's alright.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.670
I am married.

38:32.700 --> 38:36.950
To Jamie; I met him last winter in Switzerland.
Thanks to William.

38:37.410 --> 38:41.410
He is a Pinko, and he is English.

38:42.370 --> 38:43.820
Is that why you're back?

38:44.120 --> 38:46.240
Where will you live?/
In Eli.

38:51.410 --> 38:52.990
Look!

38:55.660 --> 38:57.990
Do you know what happened to my mink coat?

38:58.830 --> 39:00.330
It disappeared.

39:03.580 --> 39:04.710
I am going to Canada.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.880
I hope you are in a convoy./
In a destroyer.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.170
It's terrifying.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.450
Well, with some handsome scientists?

39:15.450 --> 39:17.320
Anyone a catch?

39:18.330 --> 39:19.920
They're all married.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.410
So?

39:21.700 --> 39:23.950
Sonya!/
Aw, come on.

39:25.370 --> 39:28.950
You know, Leo is in Montreal?
At the University.

39:29.330 --> 39:34.040
You could see him./
Montreal! I don't think..

39:34.080 --> 39:37.040
Imagine how annoyed Leo would be,
to discover you're having an affair.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.920
Oh, stop it!

39:40.330 --> 39:41.750
It's a hell of a journey!

39:42.450 --> 39:46.490
What else is there to do?
Except have marvelous sex..

39:48.160 --> 39:49.990
I thought I'd take a book.

39:52.620 --> 39:56.240
<i>.. becomes explosive./
So, that's why the backup reactor is..</i>

39:56.290 --> 39:58.000
<i>..a breeder reactor.</i>

39:59.200 --> 40:02.950
The thing is, there's lots of
chemicals you see, and if you mix..

40:04.700 --> 40:07.450
<i>Heterogeneous reactor,
uses far less heavy water.</i>

40:07.500 --> 40:12.170
<i>If you take the Plutonium from Uranium
or Uranium 233 from Thorium, or..</i>

40:13.620 --> 40:15.450
Or Borium!
Christ!

40:15.500 --> 40:19.130
Listen to me; I'm sorry!
I haven't stopped talking shop since we left.

40:19.580 --> 40:22.710
There's plenty of time to go through all of this.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.910
Will your wife miss you for five weeks?

40:28.790 --> 40:32.000
I'd be surprised if she even noticed that I'd gone.

40:36.830 --> 40:38.460
To not being torpedoed!

40:40.950 --> 40:42.660
<i>Yes, receiving.</i>

40:46.500 --> 40:48.250
<i>No, it's gone again, I'm afraid.</i>

41:02.370 --> 41:04.120
We married too soon.

41:04.370 --> 41:06.700
But you were in love?/
Yes!

41:07.370 --> 41:09.200
No? I don't know..

41:12.160 --> 41:13.530
I don't think so!

41:45.500 --> 41:47.960
Have you ever loved anyone enough to..

41:51.290 --> 41:53.040
There was someone..

41:54.120 --> 41:57.660
I loved him and I think he loved me.

41:59.790 --> 42:01.960
I thought I was going to marry him, but..

42:03.200 --> 42:05.280
He never asked.

42:06.870 --> 42:08.660
He sounds like an idiot!

42:22.620 --> 42:24.410
Professor Davis!

42:24.450 --> 42:26.570
Taylor Scott./
Good to meet you.

42:26.620 --> 42:28.370
Please, this way!/
Thank you!

42:32.160 --> 42:35.530
They will take you to your cabins later./
Cabins?

42:36.200 --> 42:39.370
Your quarters.
But first, you should meet Kierl.

42:39.410 --> 42:41.320
I know I met him once before.
In London, I think.

42:41.370 --> 42:43.370
Oh, that makes it even easier.

42:43.410 --> 42:48.160
There is something for the little lady.
It's called a tumble dryer.

42:49.040 --> 42:51.920
For isotopes?/
No, for laundry.

42:52.330 --> 42:56.540
Not that you'll have any time to do it
We're all on 18 hour shifts.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.670
Are there any American scientists here?

43:01.700 --> 43:06.240
No, no, they stopped sharing research with us
when they started the Manhattan project.

43:06.700 --> 43:10.700
They think all us foreigners are security risks.
And they got it into their heads that we Canadians..

43:10.750 --> 43:13.920
..want to bring the russians into it./
Well, it might not be such a bad idea.

43:14.870 --> 43:16.030
Excuse me?

43:16.080 --> 43:18.750
The Russians saved us,
we couldn't have stood much more of the Blitz.

43:18.790 --> 43:23.080
Thank God Hitler invaded them, and not us./
Don't let anyone else here know that you think that.

43:23.370 --> 43:26.070
They are our allies.
Now we have cut them out of research.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.910
Hardly surprising,
it's making them even more paranoid.

43:28.950 --> 43:30.700
The Yanks want to get there first.

43:30.750 --> 43:34.170
They don't trust anyone now,
and they're looking for any excuse to see us shut down.

43:34.750 --> 43:40.130
Ah, Professor Kierl, this is
Professor Davis and his assistant..

43:40.160 --> 43:42.700
Joan Smith!
We've met once before.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.540
Yes, I admire your work at Cambridge.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.960
One, we won't know
if we have enough Plutonium..

43:48.000 --> 43:53.290
..until we have our pilot reactor at criticality using heavy water.

43:53.330 --> 43:56.540
I will leave you to it.
We all eat dinner together every night, so I'll see you then.

43:56.580 --> 43:59.380
Two, we are planning to closely follow DuPont Oak Ridge.

43:59.410 --> 44:03.570
Using chemical separation techniques;
Bismuth-Phosphate process.

44:03.620 --> 44:06.280
Now about that tumble dryer; it really is fun.

44:06.330 --> 44:10.540
If I am gonna get up to speed, I'll need the help
of First Class Cambridge Science Graduate.

44:10.580 --> 44:15.500
With one of the quickest minds in atomic physics,
so maybe your tumble dryer could wait?

44:16.790 --> 44:19.540
Peter Kierl is a genius..

44:20.580 --> 44:24.830
..but he is utterly exhausting.
 I don't know why the man can't just talk normally.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.920
Thank you for sticking up for me today.

44:30.290 --> 44:31.750
It was the truth.

44:31.790 --> 44:35.130
It's nice ... working together.

44:45.660 --> 44:47.030
Joan.

44:52.040 --> 44:55.630
Don't worry. I promise I won't tell anyone!/
No, that isn't it.

44:58.330 --> 44:59.540
I love you.

45:01.250 --> 45:03.960
No, don't be silly./
I've loved you from the moment..

45:05.160 --> 45:08.120
From the moment I said
you were not not a pretty face.

45:08.830 --> 45:10.420
But my wife..

45:13.500 --> 45:15.750
She'll never divorce me.

45:16.450 --> 45:20.200
That's why I don't want to have
just an affair with you.

45:20.250 --> 45:22.290
Not like this, do you see?

45:23.200 --> 45:24.660
I love you.

45:27.410 --> 45:29.070
You deserve more than that.

45:32.330 --> 45:36.420
Maybe ... one day.

46:24.790 --> 46:29.040
One last thing; my colleagues would like to
show you around the University of Montreal.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.540
The University? No!

46:32.330 --> 46:33.750
I mean we don't have time.

46:33.790 --> 46:37.080
I have asked them to put together a tour for you!

46:37.120 --> 46:42.910
There has been tension between the university and us.
You know, funding.

46:43.290 --> 46:46.210
You must, please
meet the dean.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.200
So it is, thank you.
Goodbye.

47:19.790 --> 47:21.580
Hello./
Good to meet you!

47:21.620 --> 47:23.570
Max Davis./
Please, this way.

47:24.790 --> 47:26.880
<i>University of Montreal
Pierre Chrichleurre pavilion.</i>

47:27.370 --> 47:29.950
Profesor Smith./
Max Davis

47:47.700 --> 47:49.120
JoJo!

48:02.830 --> 48:07.630
What are you doing in here?/
I was told by friends, that you were visiting the university.

48:08.250 --> 48:13.040
I meant, lurking in the Ladies'./
Oh, well, we can't be seen together.

48:22.410 --> 48:24.780
You are on a research trip?

48:28.540 --> 48:30.750
Dare I ask?/
No

48:35.950 --> 48:37.950
Jojo, I had to find you!

48:42.370 --> 48:45.910
I... I can't stop thinking about you.

48:53.160 --> 48:54.950
My little Comrade!

48:56.620 --> 48:58.740
The bomb must be shared..

49:00.160 --> 49:02.530
The Russians, they deserve to know.

49:04.620 --> 49:07.450
The Allies are going to do
something dreadful with it.

49:09.950 --> 49:11.570
Do not be naïve.

49:16.580 --> 49:17.830
<i>Joan!</i>

49:20.450 --> 49:24.320
I am sick of your poison kisses.

49:25.620 --> 49:28.950
Has any of it..
us.. been real?

49:29.870 --> 49:34.570
<i>Joan!</i>/
I'm fed up with being picked up and let down!

49:35.000 --> 49:37.710
You pop up whenever you want something,
and never when I need you!

49:38.160 --> 49:40.160
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

49:40.200 --> 49:43.240
<i>They are waiting to start the tour.</i>/
 Coming.

49:45.830 --> 49:47.960
You have got me all wrong!

49:49.580 --> 49:53.670
If you change your mind, call Sonya.

50:09.120 --> 50:11.240
<i>Did you meet Leo in Montreal?</i>

50:12.660 --> 50:15.370
<i>What about after the war,
back in Cambridge?</i>

50:17.200 --> 50:18.950
Mrs. Stanley?

50:20.500 --> 50:25.380
108 long tons, releasing the equivalent,

50:25.410 --> 50:29.780
..of 22 Kilotons of TNT.

50:29.830 --> 50:33.710
Successful detonation in New Mexico!

50:36.500 --> 50:39.380
One chance to get it right
and they did it!

50:41.040 --> 50:42.830
Now what?/
They'll use it.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.130
Japan?

50:45.160 --> 50:48.700
Well, they will warn them first, won't they?

50:48.750 --> 50:51.630
I went to the pictures last night,
and saw the newsreels of the death camps.

50:51.660 --> 50:53.200
We should have used it on the Krauts.

50:53.250 --> 50:56.500
But unlike the Germans,
the Japanese, they'll never surrender.

50:56.540 --> 51:00.460
It would mean the death of hundreds of thousands of people!/
Don't think like that!

51:00.500 --> 51:04.380
We are scientists.
Our job is to get the physics right.

51:04.410 --> 51:08.030
Leave the politics to the politicians.
Now, listen..

51:08.080 --> 51:10.540
..it is not a secret,
that America has the bomb.

51:10.580 --> 51:13.460
It's bound to come out,
that we are trying to make one.

51:13.500 --> 51:15.040
Stalin will want one, too.

51:15.080 --> 51:18.920
What are they going to do about that?/
Bring Russia in on it!

51:20.290 --> 51:23.080
Well, they will!
Won't they?!

51:23.120 --> 51:25.530
I don't think so./
But we are allies!

51:25.580 --> 51:28.040
For now, but who knows later./
But when we were in Canada..

51:28.080 --> 51:30.750
They won't want Stalin
having a weapon like this!

51:30.790 --> 51:33.830
Why?
In case he uses it like we could?

51:38.620 --> 51:40.570
I tell you what!
Scratch all this!

51:40.620 --> 51:43.990
Pub lunch on me, and an afternoon off!
What do you say?

51:46.870 --> 51:48.030
<i>Well done!</i>

51:49.040 --> 51:50.250
<i>Jolly good work!</i>

51:55.450 --> 51:57.240
<i>The first atomic bomb has been dropped..</i>

51:57.290 --> 52:00.330
<i>..by United State aircraft,
on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.</i>

52:01.040 --> 52:05.290
<i>..President Truman has said that the device
was more than 2000 times more powerful..</i>

52:05.330 --> 52:07.630
<i>..than the largest ever bomb used to date.</i>

52:12.540 --> 52:17.960
<i>President Truman has announced, a second bomb
 has been dropped on the city of Nagasaki..</i>

52:18.830 --> 52:24.170
<i>...74,000 people have been killed
and at least as many injured.</i>

52:35.950 --> 52:39.410
<i>This is what Hiroshima looked like after the blast..</i>

52:40.000 --> 52:44.080
<i>..four and a half square miles
 of this heavily populated city..</i>

52:44.120 --> 52:46.120
<i>..completely burned out.</i>

52:46.160 --> 52:50.780
<i>..135,000 dead.
Either killed instantly..</i>

52:50.830 --> 52:54.420
<i>..or from the effects
 of radiation in the aftermath.</i>

52:54.700 --> 53:00.530
<i>Nobody yet knows how many more thousands
 will die in the coming years, due to radiation.</i>

53:00.580 --> 53:05.380
<i>The world has never witnessed destruction
on this scale before.</i>

53:52.830 --> 53:54.710
<i>Eli 4 3 6?</i>/
Sonya!

53:54.750 --> 53:57.290
Joan?/
I've got something for you.

53:58.910 --> 54:00.990
<i>Preparing Exhibit E.</i>

54:00.990 --> 54:03.250
<i>Can we wrap this up?
We've been through all this! </i>

54:03.250 --> 54:05.500
She's denied everything you've alleged.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.710
Passing Exhibit E to the accused.

54:09.540 --> 54:10.540
Do you recognize this?

54:10.830 --> 54:15.330
<i>"Fluctuations in the efficiency of a diffusions plant,
2 September 1945 "</i>

54:15.660 --> 54:16.950
No.

54:17.290 --> 54:20.130
This report was produced by the Cambridge division of Tube Alloys.

54:20.160 --> 54:22.530
In 1945 just after the end of the war.

54:22.580 --> 54:24.290
It's classified material.

54:24.660 --> 54:27.570
Yet somehow found its way
into a KGB file in Moscow?

54:27.620 --> 54:30.620
Attributed to Agent Lotto?/
Who is Agent Lotto?

54:30.660 --> 54:33.410
We have this file
from a recently defected Russian agent.

54:35.750 --> 54:37.960
What does it got to do with me?

54:50.080 --> 54:51.330
Joan!

54:53.790 --> 54:56.920
I've become so English,
I'm desperate for a tea!

54:58.120 --> 55:00.070
Sonya!/
What?

55:00.620 --> 55:03.740
Congratulations!/
Oh, this?

55:04.950 --> 55:08.410
We thought it was about time
It has been much easier than..

55:09.790 --> 55:11.210
Than what?

55:12.450 --> 55:15.780
Than I expected!
Jamie's been wonderful.

55:26.700 --> 55:29.120
So!
Have you got something for me?

55:31.120 --> 55:34.160
What if it goes wrong?/
The KGB will have me shot!

55:35.370 --> 55:36.740
I mean here.

55:37.950 --> 55:40.450
The British hang you for treason,
don't they?

55:42.330 --> 55:43.750
Stop scaring yourself.

55:44.330 --> 55:47.210
We're going to be fine./
I'm not brave like you.

55:47.250 --> 55:50.830
Nobody would suspect us!
We're women.

55:52.950 --> 55:54.870
I almost forgot.

55:55.950 --> 55:57.910
Happy Birthday, darling!/
But it's not..

55:57.950 --> 56:01.820
I know it's a little early,
so do not open it here. Save it!

56:14.250 --> 56:15.670
<i>What happens..</i>

56:16.620 --> 56:18.490
<i>..after I give it to you?</i>

56:18.540 --> 56:22.330
<i>I tell William.
Then some of it, I can radio.</i>

56:22.370 --> 56:25.620
<i>Can't people listen in?</i>/
<i>I'll encrypt it first!</i>

56:31.000 --> 56:34.460
<i>Behave normally.
Don't look nervous.</i>

56:36.410 --> 56:37.780
Thank you./
Thanks.

56:37.830 --> 56:42.630
<i>We need files, reports,
drawings, diagrams.</i>

56:49.830 --> 56:51.500
So sorry!

56:57.620 --> 57:00.240
<i>We should always meet in public places.</i>

57:01.910 --> 57:04.490
<i>It's too dangerous to come to my house.</i>

57:05.330 --> 57:08.670
<i>For new material, make an extra copy.
Don't conceal it.</i>

57:09.040 --> 57:11.830
<i>Keep it with the real filing,
until you're ready to bring it to me.</i>

57:14.200 --> 57:18.870
<i>If you must hide anything,
do it in plain sight.</i>

57:19.290 --> 57:21.580
<i>Be prepared to improvise!</i>

57:22.370 --> 57:23.740
Oh!/
Sorry!

57:24.330 --> 57:28.460
<i>And if you think you're being followed,
go into a ladies' shop.</i>

57:28.830 --> 57:31.580
<i>No man will follow you there.</i>

57:37.620 --> 57:39.240
Hello Katya.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.700
<i>Agent Lotto!</i>

57:47.700 --> 57:49.990
You did this, didn't you?

57:54.200 --> 57:55.780
What did you think?

57:59.580 --> 58:01.250
Nick ../
How could you?

58:06.080 --> 58:07.380
Why?

58:11.910 --> 58:14.320
Everyone in my office,
now!

58:20.080 --> 58:25.290
I have been  informed by MI-5,
that Peter Kierl..

58:25.330 --> 58:29.040
The scientist whom Joan
and I worked with in Canada,

58:29.080 --> 58:31.420
Has been uncovered
as a Russian spy.

58:31.700 --> 58:36.200
<i>He's given the Russians a windfall,
which could accelerate them making their own bomb</i>

58:36.250 --> 58:41.960
So everyone please,
extra precaution, extra vigilance!

58:43.750 --> 58:45.040
Thank you.

58:46.540 --> 58:49.080
Joan!
Could I have a word, please?

58:56.080 --> 58:59.000
It seems Kierl wasn't such a wet fish after all.

59:01.040 --> 59:06.290
I've been given a list of potential suspects,
identified in Canada.

59:06.330 --> 59:08.000
Which might have been Kierl's contact.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.330
One of them is Leo Galich.

59:10.370 --> 59:16.160
Now, I know that from your file,
you associated with him while he was here.

59:19.080 --> 59:21.670
He's not the one, is he?

59:22.790 --> 59:24.960
On the..
On the boat.

59:25.200 --> 59:29.070
When you said that,
there was one who didn't..

59:30.410 --> 59:32.320
It was a long time ago.

59:35.330 --> 59:37.920
I still think he's an idiot, by the way.

59:39.330 --> 59:43.290
I haven't mentioned him in my report.
There's no need to, is there?

59:44.950 --> 59:47.990
The police are here!
It's some sort of inspection.

59:48.040 --> 59:51.210
<i>Who has the key to this locker?
Open it, please!</i>

59:51.450 --> 59:53.160
<i>Open this door, sir!</i>

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:34.170
Goodness!
What a palaver!

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.910
Karen, I don't suppose you have
any spare sanitary towels?

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.570
I've been caught out!

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.450
I left a box in the cupboard in the lavvy./
Thanks.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:01.740
Excuse me, Miss.
The professor said you might be here.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.990
We need to examine some files.

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:10.780
- Tea!
 - Pardon?

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:13.830
Well, you must be parched!/
Not on duty.

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:19.420
If you don't need me../
Would you mind if I take a look?

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.040
Of course not.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.370
I'm sorry, Miss.

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.030
Don't worry!
Excuse me.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.910
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.910
It's only me.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.990
I don't know how
you can be so relaxed.

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:33.490
The police searched
Tube Alloys today.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.320
Kierl was one of yours, wasn't he?

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:47.580
He fell more easily than you.

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:51.830
He was angry at how the Soviet Union
had been exluded from the research.

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.570
They're on to you!

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.910
MI-5..
They have your name on a list!

01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:58.910
Well, I'm part of the establishment now

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:02.240
They'd look pretty slack,
if they hadn't spotted me.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:10.920
I've been given a research post at King's College
in London on Soviet planning policy.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.570
That's why you're back, then./
 No!

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:16.370
For you.

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:22.030
I want you to be careful.

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.830
I am careful!/
JoJo!

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:30.500
Be more..
More careful!

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.950
You have no idea how important you are.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.410
There's a key in there.
My London address; telephone number.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.490
Call me..
Any time.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.870
You better go.
It's getting late.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:04.320
I rather thought I could stay.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:11.830
I'll get some blankets.
The sofa is a bit lumpy, but with some cushions ...

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.370
I have something for you.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:08.210
It's the patron saint of scientists.

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:11.660
You?

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:16.070
Religious?/
We all have one.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.910
Mine is St. Christopher.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.820
Patron saint of travelers.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.700
Curare.
You place it in the crook of your elbow.

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:39.960
It's untraceable.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.620
Keep it with you at all times.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.700
Will I need it?

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.240
<i>So, your affair with Leo Galich started again?</i>

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.320
You saw quite a lot of him
over the next few months?

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.320
I'm sorry, I have got
a terrible headache.

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:11.920
Time's 15:23.
Interview suspended.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.030
Very well, we'll take a break.
See what we can find.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.950
I'm so sorry, Nick.

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:26.210
For what you did? Or getting found out?/
About all this.

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.540
Sorry doesn't quite cover it.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.830
There's something,
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:38.660
Could you ... would you
 speak for me, when this goes to court?

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:43.070
I'd plead guilty;
I'm not asking you to lie for me.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.620
Good!
We'd both end up in jail if I did.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.130
Your only chance is mitigating circumstances.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.240
I knew you would understand./
I don't!

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:58.040
How could you have done this?!/
Nick!

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.130
You became a barrister because you believed
in what you were doing. Well, so did I!

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:10.070
So, in your arrogance, you decided you'd save the world,
by sending our classified documents to a murderous dictator?!

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.370
We didn't know that then!

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.750
Sonya and Leo and I, we had no idea!/
They were using you!

01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:18.290
<i>No!</i>

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.660
So..

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.040
Nick..

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.830
Will you speak for me?/
I don't know!

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.210
I don't know if I can.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.580
I was thinking of going away.

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:49.240
Where?

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.240
Not Russia!

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.630
I want you to come with me./
I'll never go there!

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:02.200
Think of what they can offer us.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:11.620
Years and years ago... you told me,
if there was total destruction, which we've had.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.500
You communists would build up civilization.
From scratch. In a new way.

01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:18.960
How is Russia doing that?

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.960
All I see is repression./
So why do you help us?

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.240
To make a just world!

01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:29.960
An equal place.
I am not doing it for them!

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.880
I'm doing it for everyone!

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.790
You are so blinkered!
- No, that's belief!

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:44.410
What about my beliefs? The purity of science?
You've ruined that for me!

01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.210
And us?

01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.490
A smokescreen.

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.540
Fog.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.870
I've been a fool.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:09.450
And that's not what love is.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.630
Get off me!
Excuse me.

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.330
Come on, Leo! Answer!

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:50.410
Pick up!

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.200
Leo!

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.920
<i>The police ruled it suicide.</i>

01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:44.950
<i>But our files suggest the KGB were involved.</i>

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:47.950
I should never
have walked out on him.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.170
What else did he have?
Poor Leo!

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.670
I think that's enough for now.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.630
We'll give you a few minutes.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.070
Time's 11:32;
interview suspended.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.710
They'll wear you out./
It was only a blackout.

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.000
I've still got all my marbles.

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:26.580
Did you tell Allison and the children?/
Allison, yes.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.200
Don't know what to say to the boys.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.380
Maybe I can.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.950
There is one thing you have to tell me.
And I want the absolute truth.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.660
How much did dad know?

01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:50.120
Enough.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:00.670
What are you doing here?

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:06.160
This is bigger than one person, you know./
Have you already white-washed him from history?

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.750
That's what you lot usually do, isn't it?

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.170
Doesn't anyone care why?/
Of course we do!

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.490
You know what I felt for him!

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.870
Sonya thinks he'd lost his way.
He was questioning Stalin; the whole system!

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:25.240
That's rubbish!
He wanted to go to Russia.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.240
William, I think..

01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:34.820
The last thing I said to him was..

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.000
was.. that I didn't love him!

01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:42.660
And then I found his body!

01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.620
Look, everyone thinks you
did all this for Leo.

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.530
But I know that wasn't true.

01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:53.290
I can't start again.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.750
We're not allies any more.
The war's over.

01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:59.330
Yes, with 80 million dead.

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.820
20 million of them Russians.
Do you want that again?

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:05.630
What happens if I get caught?/
You won't!

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:09.740
But, if it looks like you might..
I can help!

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.660
I can get you out./
How?

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.910
I'm pretty high up in
the Foreign Office these days.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.660
For some reason, they rather like me.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.630
Did Sonya tell you,
I'm getting married?

01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:24.070
She is my secretary.
Lovely girl!

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.920
It is a good cover for Kharak.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.460
Listen, Joan.

01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:33.450
We need you.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.370
Let me tell Sonya to expect your call!

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.120
Please connect me to Eli 4-3-6.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.370
<i>I am sorry, caller.
That line is no longer in service.</i>

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:04.450
<i> Would you like me to try another?</i>/
 No.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.830
No, thank you.

01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:17.620
<i>Now boarding!</i>

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.210
<i>Now boarding!
Platform 2.</i>

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.530
Excuse me,
do you know where this is?

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:32.410
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:35.910
Thank you!/
Madam.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.960
Sonya!

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:31.580
Sonya!

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.950
Sonya! Are you here?

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.170
Uhm, Joan!

01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:07.460
Come and have a drink with me.

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.450
I have to go./
Joan!

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.710
I thought you said you didn't want an affair?/
I don't!

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:37.910
Then, why../
I asked my wife for a divorce.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:43.620
I have been asking her for years.
Ever since we got back from Canada.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.870
She has always refused..
The social embarrassment.

01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:49.990
But she can't hold out forever.
I've offered her..

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.210
..everything.

01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:56.280
I need to be responsible for my own happiness.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.420
That means being with you.

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.460
I still love you, Joan.

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:04.950
Tell me you feel the same.

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:41.700
<i>Yes, sir!</i>/
We are from Special Branch.

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.780
We are here to see Professor Davis.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.740
One moment.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.420
Max!
The police are here!

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:00.910
MI-5 will think it's come from us!

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.000
The Russians. They've done it!
They've tested!

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.880
How did they get there?
They were nowhere near us!

01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:07.820
So, someone must..

01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:13.630
Everything I've worked for.. it's gone!
It's..

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500
I can't believe this is happening!

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.700
Professor Max Davis?

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.240
Special Branch.
You are under arrest!

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.580
I haven't done anything!

01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:32.380
We have received a report from the
Canada Research Unit about your Russian sympathies.

01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:45.910
<i> How could you let them arrest him?</i>/
I thought he was safe.

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:48.130
There was no evidence against him.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.160
I knew something was wrong.
I had no idea it was all built on lies.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.200
What lies?
My love for you? For your father?

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:56.040
You clearly had no love for your country!

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.620
How dare you?!

01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:01.540
You have no idea what it was like!

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:06.750
War after war after war;
all the dead, the grieving, the heartbreak!

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:10.960
We were saturated with it.
I would have done anything to stop that happening again.

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:14.330
It wasn't about communism
or fascism.

01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:18.030
They were using you and you still don't see it?/
<i>Who was using who?</i>

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.910
Alright, I was a shadow in a man's world
Invisible, but ...

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:26.870
In the end, powerful./
Betraying your own country? God, I'm ashamed of you!

01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:30.210
I loved my country!

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.450
Alright, I was frightened
 out of my wits most of the time!

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:36.830
But I knew I had to do it.
I knew I had to carry on.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.200
Why can't you understand?

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.420
Use your heart for once,
Nick, instead of your head.

01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:45.740
You are a traitor./
<i>To what?</i>

01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:49.210
<i>To millions more dying?</i>
I was fighting for the living!

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.210
I thought if both sides had the same weapon,
that could destroy each other..

01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:56.410
..neither side would use it.

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.540
I was in a unique position..

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:03.420
I could defuse their bombs. So I did!
And I was right, wasn't I?

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:07.910
They haven't used it; not for 50 years.
Have they?!

01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:10.410
<i>Have they?!</i>

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:15.540
Alright, you can call
me a traitor to my county, but..

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.830
...at least I was trying to save
the world from mass destruction!

01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:21.910
You are just twisting words.

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:24.250
You gave Russia the bomb!

01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:27.290
I'm finished when this comes out!

01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:31.570
I can't..

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:36.210
Can't what, Nick?

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.240
I can't do this!

01:23:40.290 --> 01:23:41.710
You mean..

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.420
You mean you won't stand by me?!
Your own mother?

01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:53.920
I can't do this, Nick!

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.320
Not on my own.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.500
You came!

01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:14.830
Of course I came./
Keep your distance!

01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:26.420
The service around here is terrible.

01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:34.080
I brought you some cigarettes.

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:36.420
I've got some news!

01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:39.210
I got a letter from my wife.

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:43.450
If I had known all I had to do,
was get myself arrested ...

01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:48.320
Why are you crying?

01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.380
I can't marry you, Max!

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:56.920
Of course you can./
No I can't!

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.670
I'll get out of here, I haven't done anything./
I know you haven't!

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.580
Two minutes alone?

01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.820
It was me./
What?

01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:03.320
The secrets!

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:11.460
Secrets?/
I'm so sorry!

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.410
I'm going to tell them everything!

01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:23.080
The bomb!

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.660
Oh My God!/
I'm so sorry!

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.460
You?

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.740
How could you?

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.540
Why?

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.660
Hiroshima!

01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:53.170
Why?

01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.910
I'm going to tell them everything!

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:02.500
There is a boat to Australia.

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.130
I'll get on it, confess..
And then you'll be free!

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.070
No!

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:11.280
Please, just a few days./
No!

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.330
But don't you see? What is the point of that?
I love you!

01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:19.030
I can't live without you!

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.620
I don't want you to go to Australia!

01:28:24.450 --> 01:28:25.870
I love you!

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.490
Do you feel the same?/
Of course, I do!

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:34.490
Max! What have I done?/
Let me go to trial!

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.240
There is no evidence.
I'll clear my name.

01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:40.420
No, then you'll have to lie about me
in court. I can't let you do that.

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.740
Even if you are acquitted,
everyone will remember this.

01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:45.790
You won't be able to clear your name!

01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:48.250
You won't be able to go back to
your old job.. or your old life!

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:53.130
But don't you see? I don't want my old life!
I want a new life here with you!

01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:01.910
There might be another way!/
What?

01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:04.670
Time!

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.700
What other way?

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:22.710
I will not be put off any longer!
I have been sat there for a whole bloody hour!

01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:25.460
Now, you tell Mr. Mitchell that I want to see him right now!/
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:28.040
I demand to see him!
It's completely unacceptable!

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.920
I'm so sorry!
A dreadful misunderstanding.

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:35.030
Did you have to make such a ghastly scene?

01:29:35.290 --> 01:29:37.380
Did you have to ignore my calls?

01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:41.830
Everything's falling apart!

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:45.780
Kharak's been posted to
the Indian embassy in Washington.

01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:49.330
It should be a coup, except he's a
 terrible lush, falling out of clubs.

01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:52.210
I think the pressure's got to him.

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:55.830
But that's not why you're here though, is it?

01:29:55.870 --> 01:29:58.030
How could you let Sonya do it?

01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:04.070
I can't stop Sonya doing anything.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.200
Well, you run all the operations../
My dear girl, Sonya does!

01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.000
Always has..

01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:19.660
I didn't know she denounced him,
until it was too late.

01:30:20.410 --> 01:30:22.990
Do you think I'd let anyone hurt him?

01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:32.750
Who is this?

01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:38.380
Leo./
Turn it over!

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:41.330
Ah..

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.920
Who is it?/
Leo's son.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.700
With Sonya?

01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:53.160
So that's why she suddenly
went to Switzerland/

01:30:55.330 --> 01:30:57.170
Everybody knew, except me.

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:00.700
You must think I'm such an idiot!

01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:04.380
He felt deeply for you, you know.
He just didn't have the words.

01:31:06.370 --> 01:31:10.120
Listen, I can organize
a full defector program!

01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:13.200
Not Russia.
Australia!

01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:14.750
That's where I want to go./
You're right.

01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:18.040
Sonya's gone back to Moscow,
that might be awkward.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.670
Australia..

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.960
Alright, but give me a week or two./
No.

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:28.570
There is a boat; leaves in 3 days.
And I need two tickets.

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:32.280
You have to get Max out of prison!/
The professor?

01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:34.000
I told him everything!/
Why?

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.540
Because I am not going to let him rot
in jail for something he didn't do.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:41.290
No, I can't.
It's too risky!

01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:43.910
You will have to leave him, and go alone.

01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:56.790
You wouldn't!

01:31:56.830 --> 01:32:00.130
I have one for you wife,
and one for the Daily Mail.

01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:04.950
I want two tickets;
two new identities.

01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:11.410
<i>Britain's last spy from  the Atomic Age
has finally been exposed.</i>

01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:14.660
<i>Joan Stanley's name was released
 to the House of Commons yesterday.</i>

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.660
<i>She was personally responsible
for providing Russia with British atomic secrets.</i>

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:47.630
I have been accused of passing information
to the Russians in the 1940s.

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:56.500
<i>Information which accelerated
 their ability to build an atomic bomb.</i>

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:06.530
I have been accused of deceiving my colleagues and my family.
This I don't deny.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.960
But I have also been accused
 of deceiving my country.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.030
I'm not a spy!

01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:37.030
I don't believing working against one's country.

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:42.920
I wanted the Russians to be
on an equal footing with the West.

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:45.740
I'm not a traitor.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.370
I...

01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:57.910
I wanted everyone to share the same knowledge.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.200
Because../
How much did the Russians pay you?

01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:02.750
<i>Did you think you would get away with it..</i>

01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:06.210
..because only that way..

01:34:06.450 --> 01:34:11.700
..could the horror of
another World War be averted.

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:19.120
And I think if you look back
at history, you'd see I was right.

01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:24.670
<i>You should be ashamed of yourself!</i>

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:27.670
Red Joan!

01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:33.210
Mrs. Stanley has nothing to be ashamed of!

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.330
She has made real something we all talk about,
but have no idea how to achieve.

01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:42.290
Peace.

01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:47.450
Now, if you have any further questions for Mrs. Stanley,
would you please address them to me.

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.280
I am her lawyer.

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:54.130
And her son.

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:54.540
