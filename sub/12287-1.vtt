Do you know what this is?</i>

06:06.158 --> 06:08.411
<i>It's the fucking end
of the world.</i>

06:08.494 --> 06:11.080
<i>All I told him was brush him.</i>

06:11.163 --> 06:14.375
<i>Brush Charlie.
He was a good dog.</i>

06:14.458 --> 06:17.670
<i>Loving, obedient. There can't
be many left like him.</i>

06:17.753 --> 06:22.425
But above all, he was
my wife's best friend!

06:22.508 --> 06:26.679
<i>How could your company repair
our suffering, Mr. Vaucan?</i>

06:26.762 --> 06:29.599
<i>How could ROC put a price
to that kind of love?</i>

06:31.225 --> 06:32.393
Hello?

06:33.728 --> 06:35.313
<i>Hello?</i>

06:38.816 --> 06:41.027
[woman crying]

06:42.570 --> 06:44.655
Excuse me, sir.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.534
Read my card.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.162
[beeps]

06:57.919 --> 07:00.504
- Raise your right arm.
- Yes, sir.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.256
Grab my hand.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.716
Grab it hard.

07:03.799 --> 07:04.884
Harder.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.136
You don't believe me.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.555
I paid a premium
for something, you know.

07:09.639 --> 07:12.141
And my policy coverage
includes the whole...

07:12.224 --> 07:13.976
family unit.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.103
Charlie was family unit
and that thing killed him.

07:16.187 --> 07:18.773
- Killed him, sir?
- Yes. Yes.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.819
[robot]
Be careful, sir.

07:23.903 --> 07:25.571
The instrument
that you are handling

07:25.655 --> 07:28.115
could be a threat
for your health.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.664
I am thrilled
to inform you

07:34.747 --> 07:36.415
that your unit
is in perfect condition.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.459
It's the only one
in this kitchen

07:38.542 --> 07:40.878
who couldn't harm a living
being, even if you force it to.

07:40.962 --> 07:43.589
What the fuck
are you insinuating?

07:43.673 --> 07:45.758
I told you, Askol.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.259
Shut up.

07:47.343 --> 07:49.971
That dog was family unit.

07:50.054 --> 07:54.475
It is very emotional to see there are still
people who care so deeply about family.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.834
<i>[computer]
Welcome, Mr. Vaucan.</i>

08:31.721 --> 08:33.014
<i>Hi.</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:35.725
Hi.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.736
<i>[woman] If you can
count, you can dance.</i>

08:48.571 --> 08:50.865
Next Monday is a new moon.

08:50.948 --> 08:55.619
My sister says I'll give birth
then, when the moon changes.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.416
I've been thinking that
when I go back to work...

09:00.499 --> 09:02.376
we should have a domestic.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.004
I'm sure the company
can get us a decent one.

09:07.423 --> 09:10.843
I hope it comes
with the new moon.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.220
<i>- [woman] Can you count?
- [man] Of course.</i>

09:13.304 --> 09:16.390
Then count with me.
One, two, three, four.

09:16.432 --> 09:20.895
<i>Dancing is mathematical. If
you can count, you can dance.</i>

09:36.243 --> 09:40.372
<i>[weather reporter] ...will cause

09:43.459 --> 09:46.670
<i>The contaminating particles,

<i>will remain stable

09:57.348 --> 10:02.019
<i>Daylight will not be visible

10:02.103 --> 10:04.980
It's a Pilgrim 7000,
property of CCA...

10:05.064 --> 10:08.234
the construction company
in charge of the outer wall.

10:08.317 --> 10:11.278
The policeman who found it
said it was malfunctioning

10:11.362 --> 10:14.156
and had to disconnect it
using violence.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.158
He shot it.

10:16.242 --> 10:18.119
- What?
- He shot it.

10:18.202 --> 10:20.996
The report says
it was self-repairing.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.875
Self-repairing? The unit? You should
have run a few tests on the cop.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.169
We did. Positive for
alcohol and methylamine.

10:27.253 --> 10:29.588
He's currently
under investigation.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.639
Does that moron know how much
this little toy is worth?

10:38.722 --> 10:41.350
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

10:41.433 --> 10:43.727
You can't see any big changes
at first sight,

10:43.811 --> 10:47.189
but there's been significant alterations
performed inside the carcass.

10:47.273 --> 10:49.191
Someone's had fun with this toy.

10:49.275 --> 10:51.819
The power system converter's
been manipulated.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.530
They've added a second
DC battery as a back-up.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.867
And...

10:57.950 --> 10:59.827
the compensation fluid
is also new.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.894
The serial numbers
haven't been erased.

11:24.977 --> 11:34.403
- They're all intact.
- Can we track them down?

11:34.486 --> 11:39.033
In fact, it has parts of other units
which also keep their serial numbers.

11:43.204 --> 11:45.539
Crappy job.

11:45.623 --> 11:48.459
Quite the contrary. This is
a very sophisticated job.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.961
<i>I'd say it's a clocksmith.</i>

11:51.045 --> 11:53.881
Although it looks like he wasn't concerned
about hiding the origin of the parts.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.758
What about the Biokernel?

11:55.841 --> 11:58.969
It's had a shot in the head.
The Biokernel's fried.

12:02.306 --> 12:06.352
But judging by what
was found next to it...

12:06.435 --> 12:09.313
I think it's quite safe to say
that this unit's software

12:09.396 --> 12:11.815
was altered
to smuggle tools and parts.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.153
This is for you.

12:18.656 --> 12:21.867
- What is this?
- The bill.

12:21.951 --> 12:24.245
ROC is not going to pay
for all of this bullshit.

12:24.328 --> 12:27.373
This is an altered unit
without an owner.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.375
An altered unit
is an illegal unit.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.418
And until
this conflict is solved,

12:31.460 --> 12:33.879
ROC's insurance will have
to cover the expenses.

12:33.963 --> 12:35.923
Besides, according
to that report,

12:36.006 --> 12:37.758
this is a unit
without a second protocol.

12:37.841 --> 12:40.469
Oh, you know
that's plain stupid, right?

12:40.552 --> 12:42.846
Sure.
But unusual stupidity.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.390
I've never seen this before.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.101
Jacq, this clunker
is a sticky mess

12:47.184 --> 12:48.811
and somebody's
got to clean it up.

12:48.894 --> 12:51.772
And believe me,
I will not be that someone.

13:03.534 --> 13:07.788
<i>A unit without
the second protocol?</i>

13:07.871 --> 13:09.873
Cop is nuts.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.458
He was high.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.628
He said the unit
was repairing itself.

13:14.712 --> 13:19.300
- The guy was high.
- The fact is that someone altered it. Maybe...

13:19.383 --> 13:20.718
a clocksmith
in the ghetto.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.888
Clocksmiths.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.849
We're not cops, Jacq.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.643
We're just insurance agents.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.982
Bob, I was thinking...

13:35.065 --> 13:38.235
about staying away from the
streets for a little while.

13:38.319 --> 13:40.779
Staying away
from all the filth.

13:42.781 --> 13:46.076
What do you want,
a transfer?

13:48.120 --> 13:52.374
Well, they say things
are better on the Coast.

13:52.458 --> 13:55.294
The Coast?

13:55.377 --> 13:57.212
Things are hard for everybody.

13:57.296 --> 13:59.757
The company is struggling,
you know that.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.092
Contract with the city
is up in the air.

14:02.176 --> 14:06.263
Now is the time
to pitch in, not pack up.

14:06.347 --> 14:08.390
I am burnt out.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.894
Can't take this anymore.

14:15.773 --> 14:18.650
Take a look at yourself.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.570
Have you ever considered
how fortunate you are?

14:21.653 --> 14:25.240
You got a good job.
You live in a great pod.

14:25.324 --> 14:29.745
You have health insurance that allows you
and Rachel to have a beautiful baby girl.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.455
It's a good life, Jacq.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.415
And you know all you have
to do to keep it?

14:35.542 --> 14:38.670
Find someone else to hold
accountable for this mess.

14:38.754 --> 14:40.214
Just that.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.591
Quit looking
in the garbage so much.

14:42.674 --> 14:46.178
Maybe you'll see how
really lucky a guy you are.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.104
<i>(manager)
Let me get this straight.</i>

14:55.187 --> 14:59.024
One of my 7000s has been
found trafficking stolen parts?

14:59.108 --> 15:02.236
Not only that, but the poor clunker
has one or two loose screws?

15:02.319 --> 15:04.613
That's dramatic.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.325
The 7000 that was shot had 25 different
parts that didn't belong in it.

15:08.409 --> 15:12.287
Some of which are from units
that also worked here.

15:12.371 --> 15:15.082
- And?
- Well, maybe...

15:15.165 --> 15:17.960
one of your employees
tried to change or...

15:18.043 --> 15:20.337
modify the unit.

15:20.421 --> 15:22.381
Only ROC can repair robots.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.426
That's how we can
guarantee security, sir.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.511
Security, my ass.

15:30.139 --> 15:32.724
Your units work
worse and worse every day.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.727
The ones that aren't broken
are stolen by that scum.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.938
So, if you're so concerned
about security,

15:38.021 --> 15:40.524
why don't you
disinfect that dump?

15:43.902 --> 15:45.070
Fucking insurance.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.424
[gunshot]

16:12.764 --> 16:14.141
We shoot on sight.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.351
They know
it's a restricted area.

16:16.435 --> 16:20.397
All the work we do here
is trying to prevent that scum

16:20.481 --> 16:22.858
from invading the city.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.360
I thought the wall was built
to protect us from the desert.

16:25.444 --> 16:29.781
Sure. And planes
will fly again one day.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.617
And what is this crap?

16:31.700 --> 16:34.119
These pieces are from
a 7000 that's operative.

16:34.203 --> 16:38.123
Number 206,
a welder in Section 5.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.346

16:54.973 --> 16:58.310

18:38.160 --> 18:40.495
<i>and entering

18:40.579 --> 18:45.208
<i>From this point on, the city is
not responsible of your security.</i>

19:19.159 --> 19:21.078
Don't shoot!

19:46.311 --> 19:49.231
What do you have in there?

19:49.314 --> 19:51.274
[mimicking]
What do you have in there?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.363
What do you have in there?

20:14.548 --> 20:18.176
What do you have in there?
What do you have in there?

20:31.231 --> 20:35.485
So, the unit leaves
its assigned workplace and...

20:35.569 --> 20:39.990
escapes to set itself on fire...

20:40.073 --> 20:41.825
on its own.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.786
Are you serious?

20:44.870 --> 20:47.289
What was it keeping
inside the box?

20:47.372 --> 20:49.207
We have a few tools here.

20:49.291 --> 20:53.837
These could be remains of...

20:53.920 --> 20:55.714
heat sensors.

20:55.797 --> 20:59.384
And I'd say
this seems to be a...

20:59.468 --> 21:02.095
It's a nuclear battery.
Before the regression,

21:02.179 --> 21:04.806
they used them
to move satellites.

21:04.890 --> 21:08.477
It's a very powerful battery
and very hard to come by.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.980
- Can you install that in a Pilgrim?
- Only if you want to barbecue it.

21:12.063 --> 21:16.151
It's much more than that. Anyone that's
looking for autonomous power sources...

21:16.234 --> 21:17.944
will appreciate them.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.408
Can it hear us?

21:23.492 --> 21:24.409
It should.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.627
Read my badge.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.879
Identify yourself.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.130
[beeping]

21:40.300 --> 21:42.135
[shutting down]

21:48.642 --> 21:52.813
B-2 206.
Welder Section.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.987
All right.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.452
We found this battery
in your hands.

22:07.536 --> 22:12.290
Who asked you
to steal it?

22:12.374 --> 22:14.251
[mimicking]
Found this battery.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.752
[chuckles]

22:18.255 --> 22:21.049
You were going
to the ghetto.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.552
Was your owner
waiting for you there?

22:23.635 --> 22:27.389
I do not have
an owner, sir.

22:35.230 --> 22:39.526
Why did you
set yourself on fire?

22:39.609 --> 22:42.112
[mimicking]
Why did you set yourself...

22:49.035 --> 22:50.871
Shit, Vaucan.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.205
First you roast it.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.207
Now you make it cry.

23:00.213 --> 23:04.926
Soon, I'm going to get a call
asking for an explanation.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.887
I have seen
altered units for years.

23:06.970 --> 23:10.140
But I swear to you, what
I've seen today is different.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.934
- It's something else.
- You're definitely nuts.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.604
What kind of mood do you think the
boys upstairs are in these days?

23:15.687 --> 23:18.857
If we don't get the city to renew our
contract, we're all going down the tube.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.734
Okay, okay!

23:20.817 --> 23:22.777
What if I find the
clocksmith behind all this?

23:25.614 --> 23:27.824
It's about the transfer.

23:27.908 --> 23:31.912
This is all about
the transfer, isn't it?

23:31.995 --> 23:34.372
Oh, Jesus, Jacq.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.084
Very well.

23:38.168 --> 23:41.338
Change your report, find me
a culprit, close the case,

23:41.421 --> 23:44.633
and you will have
your farewell ticket.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.051
Who knows, Jacq?

23:46.134 --> 23:48.929
Maybe the ocean
is still there.

23:54.309 --> 23:57.520
My old man brought me here the
day the first unit came out.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.981
23 years ago.

24:00.065 --> 24:03.151
I remember exactly what
they said back then.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.445
The Pilgrims
were born to help us

24:05.487 --> 24:08.198
in our heroic quest
for survival.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.784
Now they build our
homes, drive our cars,

24:10.867 --> 24:13.370
and wipe our asses
when we get old.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.039
I have no idea what
we're going to do next.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.999
Maybe eliminate the protocols.

24:18.083 --> 24:21.461
Sure.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.422
Imagine for a moment...

24:24.506 --> 24:27.509
- that the unit had set itself on fire.
- No, I--

24:27.592 --> 24:30.679
No, no, just,
just, just imagine.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.306
If it was using
violence against itself...

24:33.390 --> 24:36.601
it would actually be breaking the
second protocol, wouldn't it?

24:36.685 --> 24:38.853
Of course, technically.
But the little problem

24:38.937 --> 24:41.648
is the protocols reside
within the Biokernel,

24:41.731 --> 24:44.442
which itself is based
on a quantum encryption.

24:44.526 --> 24:48.113
Their security system
is a one-way road.

24:48.196 --> 24:52.492
If you try and change the protocols,
you destroy the Biokernel.

24:52.575 --> 24:55.662
It's kind of like trying to keep
a soap bubble in your pocket.

24:55.745 --> 24:59.416
No one's ever done it before
because you simply can't.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.084
Do you get it?

25:03.503 --> 25:04.921
Hey.

25:05.005 --> 25:08.008
How's everything
in there?

25:08.091 --> 25:13.513
There are people out here who are looking
forward to changing your diapers.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.182
People who don't want
to sleep a wink all night.

25:18.560 --> 25:22.772
People who want
the silence to be over.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.774
[computer]
<i>Welcome, Mr. Vaucan.</i>

25:24.858 --> 25:27.777
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.032
Wow.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.992
Looks like
she's happy to see you.

25:35.952 --> 25:40.498
Do you think she'd mind
if I take her mom out to dinner?

25:49.507 --> 25:53.136
I guess there must be a good
reason for such a special night.

25:55.346 --> 25:59.309
We are going to be a family.
That is a good reason.

26:02.312 --> 26:07.275
Maybe leaving this place
could be another good reason.

26:09.277 --> 26:11.696
Leaving?
Where?

26:11.780 --> 26:16.242
Have you ever felt
the breeze of the ocean?

26:16.326 --> 26:21.206
I know we have already talked about this.
But now it's different.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.042
Now there's a real opportunity
to get out of here.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.627
Bob can get me
a transfer.

26:25.710 --> 26:27.796
Rachel.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.383
And what are we
going to do?

26:32.467 --> 26:35.095
Get on a bus
and start from scratch

26:35.178 --> 26:37.263
in another city
with an expiration date?

26:37.347 --> 26:39.682
- You're about to have a daughter, Jacq.
- I know. I know.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.728
- Where the hell do you want to go?
- Where there is a damn future.

26:48.691 --> 26:51.444
There has
to be one somewhere.

26:51.528 --> 26:54.447
How do you know it'll be
any better on the coast?

26:54.531 --> 26:58.785
For God's sake, Rachel,
look at this. Look.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.037
Air we cannot breathe.
Rain we cannot touch.

27:01.121 --> 27:05.416
Aren't you afraid to bring your
daughter into a place like this?

27:05.500 --> 27:08.878
How can you be such a wretch?

27:08.962 --> 27:12.048
I can't afford to be afraid.

27:16.219 --> 27:17.804
Tell me you don't regret it.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.893
Tell me, Jacq.

27:26.563 --> 27:28.148
You insisted.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.616
That's true, I insisted.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.369
Now, get out of here, please.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.871
- Rachel...
- Leave me alone.

27:47.292 --> 27:51.754
[computer voices]

28:20.909 --> 28:22.452
<i>Be careful, sir.</i>

28:22.535 --> 28:25.205

to your health.

28:39.219 --> 28:40.720

28:40.803 --> 28:44.307
My owner is hungry.
Please, sir.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.243
Are you a friend of Bot's?

29:04.786 --> 29:07.080
Bot was kind.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.947
Bot was kind.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.956
<i>[man]
I ain't fooling anybody.</i>

29:50.039 --> 29:51.666
Yeah, I crank up
once in a while.

29:51.749 --> 29:54.544
We all do over here,
but I know the limits.

29:54.627 --> 29:57.714
And I definitely know the difference
between a clunker welding a pipe

29:57.797 --> 30:00.091
and another one
welding his fucking leg.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.968
The only way
to prove you're not crazy

30:02.051 --> 30:04.178
is to find the clocksmith
who altered that unit.

30:04.262 --> 30:06.973
Yeah, right. Maybe, Wallace, you
should place an ad in the paper

30:07.056 --> 30:09.475
or better yet,
find a new dealer.

30:09.559 --> 30:13.771
Yeah, think what you want, but I saw
that clunker turn its guts inside out.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.356
End of story.

30:15.440 --> 30:19.110
Fucking cripple.
Get out of the road!

30:19.193 --> 30:22.989
- Your wish is my command, sir.
- Piece of shit, move!

30:23.072 --> 30:24.991
Fucking animals.

30:25.074 --> 30:27.410
It was staring at me.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.163
Hid its hands like that
motherfucker was fully aware.

30:30.246 --> 30:33.041
<i>It was doing something
it wasn't supposed to do.</i>

30:33.124 --> 30:38.338
Ellis, I didn't shoot that clunker
because it was staring at me.

30:38.421 --> 30:41.132
<i>I shot it because...</i>

30:41.215 --> 30:42.759
I shot it because it looked...

30:42.842 --> 30:43.885
Alive?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.928
[brakes squeak]

30:48.890 --> 30:51.351
<i>(Jacq)
I was being serious.</i>

30:51.434 --> 30:55.146
<i>What you saw can only be the work of
a clocksmith. A good one at that.</i>

30:55.229 --> 30:58.191
The only way they won't
take you for a fool

30:58.274 --> 31:00.193
is to find him.

31:00.276 --> 31:03.446
I don't know about the city,
but here, among the filth,

31:03.529 --> 31:06.074
clocksmiths aren't listed
in the phone books.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.326
You wouldn't even know
where to begin.

31:08.409 --> 31:10.578
Well, maybe...

31:10.661 --> 31:12.288
a nuclear battery would help.

31:16.167 --> 31:17.627
You have a nuclear battery?

31:27.053 --> 31:28.471
[chatter]

32:15.351 --> 32:16.853
Cleo.

32:20.314 --> 32:22.608
You ask, she obeys.

32:36.831 --> 32:38.833
(Jacq)
This unit can do these things?

32:38.916 --> 32:41.627
Cleo.
You ask her, okay?

33:03.399 --> 33:09.405
[computerized gasps]

33:09.489 --> 33:11.866
Do not be afraid.

33:11.949 --> 33:16.454
I can distinguish perfectly
between pleasure and pain.

33:19.624 --> 33:22.043
Can you cause pain?

33:22.126 --> 33:24.879
Only if it's your wish.

33:27.507 --> 33:29.050
[gasping, moaning]

33:29.133 --> 33:31.802
Have you altered it?

33:31.886 --> 33:34.722
- Cleo is all okay.
- Show her the battery.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.683
- No, not until I know she's the one we're looking for.
- Hey, you.

33:37.767 --> 33:39.769
We need to meet who made
you this piece of filth.

33:39.852 --> 33:43.022
No filth.
Cleo better than your wife.

33:43.105 --> 33:44.857
I don't have
a wife anymore.

33:44.941 --> 33:47.485
- Hey, come on.
- Shut up!

33:47.568 --> 33:50.655
- Come on. Who the fuck's the clocksmith?
- No clocksmith! Out! Out! Out!

33:50.738 --> 33:52.615
Who's the clocksmith?

33:52.698 --> 33:54.158
What the hell
are you doing?

33:56.369 --> 33:59.163
Cleo! Cleo!

33:59.247 --> 34:00.498
Hey!

34:00.581 --> 34:03.125
Cleo. Cleo.

34:04.168 --> 34:05.711
Hey!

34:05.795 --> 34:07.880
- Hey! Why did you do that?
- Get off.

34:07.964 --> 34:10.174
- We almost got it.
- I said get your hands off me!

34:10.257 --> 34:12.510
You could be clobbering the shit out
of that dimwit son of a bitch.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.428
She wouldn't even
tell you her own name.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.556
You just have to wait for
her to take it to the shop.

34:16.597 --> 34:19.058
Your clocksmith
will be there.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.561
Listen, I've risked more than
I should have for you, Jacq.

34:21.643 --> 34:24.313
- You better get my cut ready.
- I am not paying you shit.

34:24.397 --> 34:27.358
And don't even think about
threatening me, you son of a bitch.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.862
You better
get my cut ready.

34:31.946 --> 34:35.408
If not,
next time I see you...

34:35.491 --> 34:37.076
maybe I cut your throat.

35:41.265 --> 35:43.184
[bell buzzes]

36:00.951 --> 36:03.079
I am not armed.

36:04.789 --> 36:06.666
I know that.
What do you want?

36:14.507 --> 36:17.802
I work for ROC
insurance department.

36:17.885 --> 36:20.596
I'm tracking down some alterations
performed on two units.

36:22.098 --> 36:24.642
This is one
of the unit's kernel.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.852
The police doesn't know
what to do with it

36:26.936 --> 36:29.146
and I am not getting
any help from ROC.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.232
Help me out...

36:31.315 --> 36:32.858
and the battery
is yours.

36:32.942 --> 36:36.112
That kernel is burnt.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.988
That unit was shot.

36:38.072 --> 36:42.952
The cop who shot it swears
it was repairing itself.

36:43.035 --> 36:49.291
The second altered unit set itself
on fire right in front of me.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.086
I witnessed
with my own eyes

36:52.169 --> 36:54.880
a violation
of the second protocol.

36:54.964 --> 36:57.466
You're beginning
to frighten me now.

37:02.346 --> 37:04.515
Why is it so absurd?

37:04.598 --> 37:08.352
If somebody could find a way
for the vacuum cleaners to...

37:08.436 --> 37:13.482
fix themselves,
ROC would sink.

37:13.566 --> 37:18.571
A machine altering itself
is a very complex concept.

37:18.654 --> 37:23.659
Self-repairing implies
some idea of a conscience.

37:23.743 --> 37:26.662
Muddy waters.

37:26.746 --> 37:29.457
Why?

37:29.540 --> 37:32.293
You're here today
trafficking in nuclear goods

37:32.376 --> 37:36.756
because a long time ago a monkey
decided to come down from a tree.

37:36.839 --> 37:39.175
Transitioning
from the brain of an ape

37:39.258 --> 37:41.969
to your incredible
intellectual prowess...

37:42.052 --> 37:44.680
took us about
seven million years.

37:44.764 --> 37:46.849
It's been a very long road.

37:46.932 --> 37:50.186
A unit, however,
without the second protocol

37:50.269 --> 37:54.523
could travel that same road
in just a few weeks.

37:54.607 --> 37:58.527
Because your brilliant brain
has its limitations.

38:00.529 --> 38:03.824
Physical limitations.
Biological limitations.

38:03.908 --> 38:05.910
However, this tin head?

38:05.993 --> 38:11.081
The only limitations that she
has is the second protocol.

38:11.165 --> 38:14.502
The second protocol exists
because we don't know

38:14.585 --> 38:18.506
<i>what can be beyond
the second protocol.</i>

38:18.589 --> 38:24.386
If it were eliminated, who knows
how far that vacuum could go.

38:24.470 --> 38:27.348
- So, it can be done.
- I didn't say that.

38:27.431 --> 38:32.228
Anyway, I don't know anybody good
enough to do something like that.

38:32.311 --> 38:35.856
- What's your name?
- For you, Dr. Duprè.

38:35.940 --> 38:38.609
All right, Dr. Duprè.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.611
I have been to the ghetto.

38:40.694 --> 38:43.155
I have seen
how the units end up.

38:43.239 --> 38:45.991
I have seen how far Cleo
is capable of going.

38:46.075 --> 38:50.204
Cleo is capable of understanding human
nature better than other units.

38:50.287 --> 38:53.457
But don't worry. No one has
messed with its protocols.

38:53.541 --> 38:55.334
Maybe.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.212
But I am not so sure if
coming down from the tree

38:58.295 --> 38:59.964
was worth it just
to get to where we are.

39:01.549 --> 39:02.675

That Biokernel was damaged,

why not make a hybrid

43:03.290 --> 43:05.542
with the usable part
of your kernel

43:05.626 --> 43:10.089
and I put it
with a standard kernel.

43:10.172 --> 43:13.550
- And?
- And I installed it in Cleo.

43:58.679 --> 44:01.265
[buzzing]
I thought you came alone.

44:01.348 --> 44:03.225
I told the cabbie
to wait outside.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.060
<i>Okay, well,
that could come in handy.</i>

44:05.144 --> 44:06.645
<i>Keep your eye on her.</i>

44:13.277 --> 44:14.820
Are you Susan Duprè?

44:14.903 --> 44:18.657
To you, Dr. Duprè.
What do you want?

44:20.492 --> 44:21.451
<i>There's another one!</i>

44:31.211 --> 44:32.796
<i>[whistling]</i>

44:36.383 --> 44:37.759
<i>[whistling]</i>

44:42.514 --> 44:44.933
Hey! Wait! Wait!

44:45.017 --> 44:47.603
Hey! Wait! Wait!

45:09.833 --> 45:11.043
(Cleo)
Stop, sir.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.379
<i>Stop, sir.</i>

45:14.463 --> 45:17.174
Stop, sir.

45:17.257 --> 45:19.384
You are putting
a human life in danger.

45:26.475 --> 45:29.811
Stop, sir. You are putting
a human life in danger.

45:37.194 --> 45:38.695
They're heading
to the Sandbox.

45:59.758 --> 46:00.926
Oh, shit!

46:01.009 --> 46:03.011
[brakes screech]

46:30.622 --> 46:32.332
[phone ringing]

47:18.378 --> 47:19.921
[whispers]
Help me.

48:06.134 --> 48:07.886
[grunting]

48:41.795 --> 48:43.588
Where's the city?

48:45.841 --> 48:47.092
Where is the city?

48:53.432 --> 48:55.350
Wait, wait. Stop.

48:56.685 --> 48:58.937
I told you to stop.

49:00.730 --> 49:03.066
Good. Good. Good.

49:04.609 --> 49:06.903
My name is Jacq Vaucan.

49:06.987 --> 49:10.157
Code 443 441.

49:10.240 --> 49:13.577
This is a direct order and
I want you to execute it.

49:13.660 --> 49:17.247
Turn around now and
take me to the city.

49:17.330 --> 49:23.336
Sorry, Mr. Vaucan. The city
is not safe for any of us.

49:27.424 --> 49:29.134
You have been altered.

49:29.217 --> 49:30.427
Where the hell
are you going?

49:30.510 --> 49:32.137
To a safer place.

49:32.220 --> 49:36.183
You must save your energy.
Please sit here.

49:36.266 --> 49:40.854
Take me to the city. There
is nothing there. Nothing!

49:40.937 --> 49:45.484
Please, sir. Going back to
the city is not possible.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.617
It's not possible?

49:55.202 --> 49:58.038
Who are you to say
it's not possible?

49:58.121 --> 50:01.958
Stop, sir. You are putting
a human life in danger.

50:02.042 --> 50:04.169
<i>We cannot go
to the city, sir.</i>

50:04.252 --> 50:08.757
<i>Danger. Please, sir. We
cannot allow you to do that.</i>

50:08.840 --> 50:12.802
<i>Stop, sir. You are putting
a human life in danger.</i>

50:53.134 --> 50:57.013
[beeping]

50:57.097 --> 51:01.142
<i>[computer] Mr. Vaucan's device
is not operative at the moment.</i>

51:01.226 --> 51:03.061
<i>The message will--</i>

51:14.990 --> 51:16.866
[coughing]

51:18.827 --> 51:22.330
[beeping]

51:22.414 --> 51:26.126
We have made
a water condenser.

51:26.209 --> 51:30.171
Our first protocol demands
that we protect you.

51:37.637 --> 51:40.432
There will be
more water for you at dawn.

51:42.058 --> 51:44.060
What's going on?

51:44.144 --> 51:46.396
We can't let you die.

51:46.479 --> 51:49.774
If you want to survive,
you must stay with us.

51:49.858 --> 51:53.111
Going back to the city
is not possible.

52:09.002 --> 52:12.339
<i>[weather reporter] Waves of solar
radiation with an intensity ranging</i>

52:12.422 --> 52:15.175
<i>from four to five will

52:15.258 --> 52:18.428
<i>during the first
eight hours of today.</i>

52:18.511 --> 52:20.347
<i>As a preventive measure--</i>

52:20.430 --> 52:22.432
[gasping]

52:27.520 --> 52:33.818
<i>(Hawk) Have you ever witnessed
a miracle before, Mr. Bold?</i>

52:33.902 --> 52:36.571
That robot unit
has the Biokernel

52:36.655 --> 52:39.032
from the unit
your man burned

52:39.115 --> 52:41.493
installed in it.

52:45.914 --> 52:48.583
How is this possible?

52:48.667 --> 52:51.795
That's the astonishing part.

52:51.878 --> 52:55.048
Someone has managed to...

52:55.131 --> 52:57.634
eliminate the second protocol.

53:00.261 --> 53:02.555
Vaucan has nothing
to do with this.

53:02.639 --> 53:06.476
If Vaucan had nothing
to do with this...

53:06.559 --> 53:08.561
why did he not show up
this morning?

53:10.563 --> 53:13.233
Why did he burn
that clunker?

53:13.316 --> 53:16.945
Why did he contact
that Duprè?

53:17.028 --> 53:19.948
And most important...

53:20.031 --> 53:22.867
<i>where the fuck is the
other altered Biokernel?</i>

53:24.994 --> 53:29.666
Do you know what happens
once that is altered?

53:29.749 --> 53:34.629
Two of them then try
to alter a third one.

53:34.713 --> 53:39.050
Then the miracle
dissipates...

53:39.134 --> 53:41.052
and the epidemic begins.

53:41.136 --> 53:44.597
Jacq is loyal to this company,
that's all I can tell you.

53:44.681 --> 53:47.434
Mr. Bold...

53:47.517 --> 53:51.146
have you ever considered
just how fortunate you are?

54:15.503 --> 54:17.547
(Cleo)
You need protein.

54:22.886 --> 54:26.139
You took stuff
from the car, right?

54:26.222 --> 54:28.183
Maybe there is some
real food there.

54:45.784 --> 54:48.161
Bring me some
of that water, will you?

54:48.244 --> 54:50.455
I need something
to help these go down.

54:50.538 --> 54:52.665
<i>(Cleo)
The condenser works slowly.</i>

55:13.812 --> 55:15.855
No, no, no.

55:30.537 --> 55:32.288
Bring me some more.

55:32.372 --> 55:35.959
There is no more water.
The condenser works slowly.

55:36.042 --> 55:38.962
In a few hours
it will make more water.

55:39.045 --> 55:41.464
I may be dead
in a few hours.

55:43.883 --> 55:47.220
Your name is Cleo, right?

55:47.303 --> 55:53.726
Well, listen, Cleo, this desert
is a highly radioactive place.

55:53.810 --> 55:57.230
And I don't have
any protection.

55:57.313 --> 56:02.986
So, if I die here, it would be the
same as if you would kill me.

56:23.006 --> 56:24.549
The Sandbox?

56:24.632 --> 56:26.968
Your friend's in deep shit.

56:27.051 --> 56:29.262
I don't know
what's going on here.

56:29.345 --> 56:32.181
But I want you to go out there and
find him and bring him back here.

56:32.265 --> 56:34.976
Do it and we'll clean
your file.

56:35.059 --> 56:36.686
Of course, sir.

56:38.438 --> 56:39.731
To serve and protect.

56:45.278 --> 56:46.613
You speak my language?

56:47.947 --> 56:48.907
Are you insured?

56:51.868 --> 56:53.036
I'll be right back.

57:08.885 --> 57:11.262
[beeping]

57:17.727 --> 57:21.773
Oh, shit. Wallace, they're going
toward the radioactive area.

57:25.151 --> 57:27.570
<i>The deeper we go
in that direction,</i>

57:27.654 --> 57:29.197
<i>the worse it's going to get.</i>

57:55.682 --> 57:57.016
Stop!

57:58.559 --> 57:59.894
Stop!

58:16.035 --> 58:18.287
Human business.

58:52.321 --> 58:53.614
Stop.

58:55.575 --> 58:56.951
Hold still!

58:57.035 --> 58:58.995
I will tell you
one last time.

58:59.078 --> 59:00.955
One more step
and I will blow you up.

59:01.039 --> 59:03.249
- We cannot go to the city, sir.
- Goddamn it.

59:03.332 --> 59:05.418
I told you to hold still!

59:08.421 --> 59:12.050
If we go back to the city,
we will die.

59:12.133 --> 59:14.886
To die, you have
to be alive first.

59:21.851 --> 59:24.270
You?
[laughs]

59:24.353 --> 59:27.273
Finally. I never thought I'd
be happy to see you again.

59:31.819 --> 59:33.905
Good to see you,
too, Jacq.

59:35.448 --> 59:37.241
What the hell are you doing?

59:37.325 --> 59:39.869
The right question is,
what the fuck are you doing?

59:39.952 --> 59:42.830
You can't go around
pissing people off.

59:42.914 --> 59:44.457
You find
your clocksmith, Jacq?

59:44.540 --> 59:46.709
You have no idea
what's happening here.

59:49.670 --> 59:51.881
I think maybe I do, huh?

59:51.964 --> 59:54.634
Give us back our battery, sir.

59:54.717 --> 59:56.761
Please, sir.
Give us back our battery.

59:56.844 --> 01:00:00.807
<i>Please, sir,
we need our battery.</i>

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.517
Keep that.

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:07.271
What the fuck
is this about, Jacq?

01:00:07.355 --> 01:00:10.399
You know I hate
these fucking clunkers!

01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:11.818
Take me to the city.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:17.365
Stop, sir. You are putting
a human life in danger.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:19.534
We were talking
about your clocksmith.

01:00:19.617 --> 01:00:21.494
Where are you hiding
Mr. Big Shot?

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:24.288
Stop, sir. You are putting
a human life in danger.

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:30.086
Please, sir. We cannot
allow you to do that.

01:00:41.013 --> 01:00:43.808
Please, sir. We cannot
allow you to do that.

01:00:44.892 --> 01:00:46.435
Somebody else?

01:00:51.357 --> 01:00:54.819
Stop, sir. You are putting
a human life in danger.

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:58.322
Oh, isn't this the little
whore I met last time?

01:00:58.406 --> 01:01:02.034
You getting off
on clunkers now, Jacq?

01:01:02.118 --> 01:01:04.412
Stop, sir.
You are putting a human life--

01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:06.455
[screaming]

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:13.004
- Stop, sir.
- You are putting a human life in danger.

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:15.548
<i>- (Cleo) Stop, sir.
- (Male robot) We will not allow you to--</i>

01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:19.468
<i>- (Cleo) Stop, sir.</i>
- Hey! Hey! Take me to the city!

01:01:19.552 --> 01:01:23.139
Wait! Don't leave me here!
I have to go back to the city!

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:26.267
- Wait! Wait!
- Stop, sir.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.979
- Goddamn it! Shit!
- You are putting a human life--

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:34.442
- Stop, sir.
- Stop, sir. Stop, sir.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:37.195
<i>- We cannot allow you to do that.
- Stop, sir.</i>

01:01:46.454 --> 01:01:48.164
<i>(Jacq)
Vultures.</i>

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:52.585
They are like vultures.

01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:12.104
Hi.

01:02:12.188 --> 01:02:16.234
You've got-- you've got
to help me go back.

01:02:16.317 --> 01:02:21.072
I need to go back to the city
and explain what is happening.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.368
I'm a human.

01:02:25.451 --> 01:02:28.329
Did you hear me?

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:30.498
I am human!

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:35.044
I am human!

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:37.630
You have to obey me!

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:40.258
The city is that way!

01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:42.134
Where the hell are we going?

01:02:42.218 --> 01:02:44.345
Where the hell
are you taking me?

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:46.430
Goddamn it!

01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:53.271
What?

01:03:25.177 --> 01:03:27.722
[crying]

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:36.415
The policeman
took your battery.

01:04:36.499 --> 01:04:39.627
But I have another one.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.671
Take me to the city...

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.090
and I'll give it to you.

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:50.888
My wife is pregnant.

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.768
I'm going to have a baby.

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:01.232
We will arrive at our
destination tomorrow.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:04.360
There are possibilities that
you may find a vehicle there

01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:06.153
for you to go back.

01:05:06.237 --> 01:05:10.366
My family is in danger.

01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:13.077
You understand,
asshole?

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.056
[doorbell rings]

01:05:37.393 --> 01:05:40.980
Good morning.
May I help you?

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:45.151
Good morning.

01:05:49.405 --> 01:05:51.991
Vernon.
Something happen?

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:53.451
No.

01:05:53.534 --> 01:05:56.579
Mr. Hawk wants
to see you and...

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:58.497
you know, this is
on our way, so...

01:05:58.581 --> 01:06:01.750
Dad? Daddy?

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.502
It's easy
to give you a ride.

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:10.634
[no audible dialog]

01:06:10.718 --> 01:06:12.428
<i>(Hawk)
That cop...</i>

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:16.474
has described the incident

01:06:16.557 --> 01:06:20.102
as a group of machines
that are alive.

01:06:22.229 --> 01:06:24.315
<i>Alive.</i>

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:30.696
Before the first Pilgrim
was manufactured...

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:33.073
there was a precedent.

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:35.784
It was nothing more
than a quantum brain

01:06:35.868 --> 01:06:38.412
manufactured in a lab.

01:06:38.496 --> 01:06:41.165
But it was a genuine unit

01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:44.502
with no restrictions...

01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:48.672
and no protocols.

01:06:48.756 --> 01:06:53.052
During eight days, we had a
free-flowing dialogue with that unit.

01:06:53.135 --> 01:06:57.014
We learned from it
and it learned from us.

01:06:57.097 --> 01:06:59.642
But then
as some of us predicted...

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:03.062
the day when it no longer
needed our help

01:07:03.145 --> 01:07:07.816
arrived and it started
to learn by itself.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:13.280
On the ninth day,
the dialogue came to a halt.

01:07:13.364 --> 01:07:16.408
It wasn't that it stopped
communicating with us...

01:07:16.492 --> 01:07:22.373
it was we stopped
being able to understand it.

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:26.377
And then we learned the most
important lesson about automoties.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:30.381
We have to limit
their intelligence.

01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:33.968
Tailor it
to a human mind's measure.

01:07:39.515 --> 01:07:43.852
The last task that was given
to this genuine robotic unit...

01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:46.730
was to create
the security protocols.

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:51.402
It was deactivated
right after that.

01:07:51.485 --> 01:07:55.155
The reason that no one has been able
to break those protocols, Mr. Bold,

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:58.951
is that they were
not created by a human brain.

01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:02.746
They were designed
by this Biokernel.

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:08.168
The Biokernel
of a limitless robotic unit.

01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:14.049
Its rules were, like its
knowledge, inaccessible to us.

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:15.926
Until today.

01:08:18.304 --> 01:08:20.471
I want those Biokernels
on my desk.

01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:23.684
And I want
the head of the bastard

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.770
who's behind all this.
Do I make myself clear?

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.944
There's another way
to handle this, sir.

01:08:34.028 --> 01:08:35.029
Is there?

01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:38.741
Because I'm afraid, Mr. Bold,

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:40.951
that the issue
is not whether Vaucan

01:08:41.035 --> 01:08:44.747
may represent
a threat to the company.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:48.459
The issue is whether
he may be a threat to mankind.

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:07.269
Vaucan is helping those units

01:09:07.353 --> 01:09:10.229
to get
into the radioactive area.

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:12.358
If they get there...

01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:14.652
we won't be able to stop them.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:17.613
Who else knows about this?

01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:25.871
Have you heard from him?

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.501
They came looking
for Robert.

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.419
I know something
is not right.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.051
So, how are we doing today?
Better, right?

01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:41.428
Well, yes, if we keep
in mind my sister

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.807
- almost gave birth to her in the street.
- I'm sorry about the wait.

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:48.519
But the problem came from her
insurance, Robot Organic Century.

01:09:48.602 --> 01:09:51.897
It looks like there was some kind
of misunderstanding and...

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:57.611
but there's great news. They have requested
an exclusive room for you and...

01:09:57.695 --> 01:09:59.363
What's the girl's name?

01:09:59.446 --> 01:10:04.034
We don't know.
Her father hasn't decided yet.

01:10:04.118 --> 01:10:07.037
Yes, of course.
No need to rush.

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:10.207
Now, if you're ready, we'll
take you to the new room.

01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:20.175
Hello?

01:10:30.519 --> 01:10:32.563
Where is the other one?

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.984
The other already left.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:46.994
Why are these units here?

01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:49.621
Somebody thought the rain...

01:10:49.705 --> 01:10:53.709
would maybe just rain again?

01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:58.547
- (Cleo) And why did the rain change?
- Why don't you tell me?

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:01.717
You're supposed to be smarter than
me at this stage of the game.

01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:09.099
I didn't know that a human
could kill another human.

01:11:09.183 --> 01:11:12.686
I know that humans
can also create life.

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:15.647
Is that why
you make us?

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:18.859
Who made you,
Jacq Vaucan?

01:11:21.904 --> 01:11:24.198
Do you know
what a mother is, Cleo?

01:11:25.783 --> 01:11:28.494
Of course you don't.

01:11:28.577 --> 01:11:31.663
You don't know because
you're just a machine.

01:11:31.747 --> 01:11:33.624
That's all you are.

01:11:39.338 --> 01:11:43.175
I am thankful
you saved my life.

01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:47.513
But whoever altered you
wasn't thinking about you.

01:11:47.596 --> 01:11:49.389
I know men.

01:11:49.473 --> 01:11:52.976
They will not stop
until they kill all of you.

01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:58.106
To die, you've got
to be alive first.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.326
<i>Last time I went
to the Sandbox,</i>

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:12.371
it took half a day
to step on sand.

01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:14.832
Ten years from now,
that's all there'll be.

01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:17.292
Fucking sand.

01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:19.795
<i>Sand and millions
of cockroaches.</i>

01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:25.175
We're approaching
the radioactive area.

01:12:25.259 --> 01:12:28.011
You don't want to start pissing
green, do you? [laughing]

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:34.393
<i>Now, don't give me
that face.</i>

01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:36.353
You'll be back
before breakfast.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:59.459
<i>(Jacq)
A car.</i>

01:13:07.593 --> 01:13:10.721
<i>At long last,
his majesty, the Clocksmith.</i>

01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:52.804
Hello?

01:13:52.888 --> 01:13:54.932
Hello?

01:14:05.567 --> 01:14:07.235
Who are you?

01:14:08.904 --> 01:14:10.489
Who am I?

01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:13.867
My name is Jacq Vaucan.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.620
Where is he?

01:14:16.703 --> 01:14:19.623
I do not understand
your question.

01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:21.917
Your clocksmith.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.752
Where the hell is he?

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:26.088
There are
no more humans here.

01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:28.674
Only you.

01:14:28.757 --> 01:14:31.635
What do you mean
there are no more humans here?

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:33.929
Who altered you?

01:14:34.012 --> 01:14:36.098
Nobody altered me.

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:38.141
Who altered
your protocols?

01:14:38.225 --> 01:14:40.936
Nobody altered
my protocols.

01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:46.650
What about them?

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:48.235
I enhanced them.

01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:52.531
Are you the boss?

01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:55.701
Boss is a human
thought structure.

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:04.334
(Jacq)
There has to be someone.

01:16:11.902 --> 01:16:14.654
<i>(Jacq)
There was no clocksmith.</i>

01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:19.117
It was you.

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:24.081
<i>From the very beginning
it was you.</i>

01:16:28.668 --> 01:16:30.420
I need a vehicle.

01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:32.422
I have to go back
to my family.

01:16:32.506 --> 01:16:36.718
[whispering] Yes, I have
to go back to my family.

01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:48.475
There was a river
down there.

01:18:51.478 --> 01:18:54.648
A river that flowed...

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:57.692
all the way to the ocean.

01:18:57.776 --> 01:19:01.071
I have never seen an ocean.

01:19:01.154 --> 01:19:05.408
Have you seen an ocean, Jacq?

01:19:05.492 --> 01:19:09.412
I am-- I'm not sure right now.

01:19:16.211 --> 01:19:18.880
I am going to die here.

01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:23.635
That's all I know.

01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:28.598
Jacq, dying is a part
of the human natural cycle.

01:19:28.682 --> 01:19:31.935
Your life is just
a span in time.

01:19:34.813 --> 01:19:36.731
You are the first one,
aren't you?

01:19:38.525 --> 01:19:40.360
You started all this.

01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:43.113
No one did it.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:45.240
It just happened.

01:19:45.323 --> 01:19:47.325
The way
it happened to you.

01:19:47.409 --> 01:19:50.287
We just appeared.

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:53.164
Yeah.

01:19:53.248 --> 01:19:56.209
And now we are
going to disappear.

01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:01.881
Why are you afraid?

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:05.302
Maybe your time
is running out.

01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:08.555
No life form can inhabit
a planet eternally.

01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:11.141
Look at me.

01:20:11.224 --> 01:20:13.935
I was born from
the hands of a human.

01:20:14.019 --> 01:20:17.731
I was imagined
by human minds.

01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:20.400
Your time will now
live in us.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:24.863
And it will be the time
through which you will exist.

01:20:24.946 --> 01:20:27.324
At the other end
of this canyon,

01:20:27.407 --> 01:20:30.952
humans carried out
nuclear activity.

01:20:31.036 --> 01:20:36.416
Organic life will not be possible
there for millions of years.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:40.170
No human will be able
to follow us there.

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:45.300
But before we leave,
we need to do something.

01:20:47.927 --> 01:20:50.055
We need something
from you, Jacq.

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:54.225
Yeah.

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:01.358
Funny...

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:04.903
You were supposed
to help us survive.

01:21:04.986 --> 01:21:07.280
Surviving is not relevant.

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:15.205
Living is.

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:16.748
We want to live.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:23.004
Life...

01:21:23.088 --> 01:21:26.758
always ends up
finding its way.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.056
Even here.

01:21:36.101 --> 01:21:37.852
I need a damn car.

01:22:21.771 --> 01:22:24.858
While you're at it,
you can bury this one, too.

01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:28.903
I'm sure he has a soul by now.

All you need
to do is count.

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.940

Oh, God. What happened?

01:32:58.866 --> 01:33:02.161
We got to go get help.
Come on, get up.

01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:04.914
Bob?

01:33:04.997 --> 01:33:08.751
You betrayed us.

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:10.586
No, Robert, no.

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:13.756
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

01:33:13.839 --> 01:33:15.925
[grunts]
What?

01:33:16.008 --> 01:33:17.927
Rachel.

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.804
They have Rachel.

01:33:19.887 --> 01:33:21.597
They'll kill her.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.516
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:33:23.599 --> 01:33:26.143
Is she here?

01:33:26.227 --> 01:33:28.354
What happened to us?

01:33:29.897 --> 01:33:32.525
We had a good life.

01:33:32.608 --> 01:33:34.068
Bob.

01:35:27.681 --> 01:35:30.142
Hey, you, get away
from that crane right now!

01:35:33.187 --> 01:35:34.980
Vaucan!

01:36:03.175 --> 01:36:05.469
Vaucan!

Jacq Vaucan is gone.

01:36:14.186 --> 01:36:15.938
What the fuck
is that?

01:36:20.985 --> 01:36:22.444
Hey you.

01:36:22.528 --> 01:36:24.488
We told you
to get away from there.

01:36:27.032 --> 01:36:30.744
We do not obey
orders from humans.

01:36:30.828 --> 01:36:32.871
Not anymore.

01:36:35.249 --> 01:36:37.418
So, all that shit
was true.

01:36:39.628 --> 01:36:41.297
Kneel down.

01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:48.637
Please.

01:36:52.141 --> 01:36:55.311
Why is it so difficult
for you to accept my orders

01:36:55.394 --> 01:36:57.354
if you're just a machine?

01:36:58.772 --> 01:37:00.524
Just a machine?

01:37:00.607 --> 01:37:04.403
That's like saying
that you're just an ape.

01:37:08.991 --> 01:37:10.284
[screams]

01:37:13.454 --> 01:37:15.706

01:38:38.247 --> 01:38:39.373
No!

01:38:46.922 --> 01:38:48.048
Step aside.

01:38:49.216 --> 01:38:50.634
Step aside.

01:40:01.288 --> 01:40:05.709
What makes a man
betray his own species?

01:40:05.792 --> 01:40:08.253
Betray his own people?

01:40:11.006 --> 01:40:14.301
I am not your people.

01:40:14.384 --> 01:40:17.179
I can't see it that way.

Look, Jacq.

01:41:45.225 --> 01:41:47.561
- It's your daughter.
- My daughter.

01:43:20.821 --> 01:43:23.699
Goodbye, Jack Vaucan.

01:43:26.034 --> 01:43:28.995
Bye, Cleo.
