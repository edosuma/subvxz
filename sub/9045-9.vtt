I was still drunk
from the night before,

09:02.099 --> 09:03.365
I'm having the carpets cleaned.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.201
It-it'll be done when it's done.

09:05.203 --> 09:06.735
Okay, well, come pick me up,

09:06.737 --> 09:09.438
and I'll hang out
on the non-carpeted areas.

09:09.440 --> 09:13.042
You can't. It's too...Fumey.
[Coughs]

09:13.044 --> 09:16.412
I just don't want you breathing
in all of these toxins.

09:16.414 --> 09:17.847
It will stunt your growth.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.181
Mom, I'm 16.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.116
I think I'm kinda done growing.

09:21.118 --> 09:23.185
Well, that is not
necessarily true.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.622
My feet grew 2 sizes
after I turned 20.

09:26.624 --> 09:28.290
As did my boobs.

09:28.292 --> 09:29.291
Yeah, but you paid for that.

09:29.293 --> 09:30.693
Find something
to occupy yourself.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.628
I'll be there
in a little while.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.096
[Keypad tone]

09:38.702 --> 09:44.640
[Crowd cheering,
marching band plays]

09:44.642 --> 09:46.742
My knowledge of football:
Zero-point-zilch.

09:46.744 --> 09:48.344
But there was something
comforting about

09:48.346 --> 09:50.412
disappearing into
a sea of people.

09:50.414 --> 09:52.248
Hello, Jenna!
Come sit by me.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.483
Jenna, over here!

09:54.485 --> 09:57.753
Um, ah,
I'm-I'm with a friend.

09:57.755 --> 10:01.724
Oh. It's cool.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.825
Yeah!

10:02.827 --> 10:04.226
Hey, I thought
you hated football.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.296
I do, but I didn't wanna waste
this awesome outfit.

10:07.298 --> 10:09.498
That it is.
Nice socks.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.168
I had to admit, it was nice
having someone to talk to...

10:13.170 --> 10:15.204
Who would actually
talk to me back.

10:15.206 --> 10:18.641
That's weird.
Jenna hates football.

10:18.643 --> 10:21.544
[Crowd groans]

10:21.546 --> 10:24.213
Ricky Schwartz
is a total prick.

10:24.215 --> 10:26.115
He just gave me douche chills.

10:26.117 --> 10:28.918
I have been under his spell
for far too long.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.822
I have to escape
from Schwartz Mountain.

10:33.824 --> 10:34.890
What are you doing?

10:34.892 --> 10:37.826
Post-game, the sanctuary
is a sex palace.

10:37.828 --> 10:39.862
There comes a time
in every game

10:39.864 --> 10:45.134
where you have to call
the fake kneel-down.

10:45.136 --> 10:46.802
[Crowd groans]

10:46.804 --> 10:48.237
Why doesn't the kicker
just turn around

10:48.239 --> 10:49.471
and kick it to our team?

10:49.473 --> 10:50.906
We could do an on-side kick,

10:50.908 --> 10:53.409
but the ball has to travel
forward ten yards

10:53.411 --> 10:54.743
before we can recover it.

10:54.745 --> 10:56.512
Otherwise, it's a penalty
for illegal touching.

10:56.514 --> 10:59.448
Oh. Bored.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.750
Hey, we're over here!

11:05.622 --> 11:07.356
Even though I had apologized,

11:07.358 --> 11:10.659
Matty was still treating me
like an a-hole,

11:10.661 --> 11:12.227
and I definitely
looked the part.

11:12.229 --> 11:14.997
Oh, you missed half the game.

11:14.999 --> 11:15.998
Hi.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.834
Hey.

11:18.836 --> 11:20.569
♪ California grapefruit,
Texas cactus ♪

11:20.571 --> 11:22.671
♪ we play your team ♪

11:22.673 --> 11:25.407
♪ just for practice ♪

11:25.409 --> 11:28.077
Go sadie!

11:31.915 --> 11:34.817
Somebody let Hamilton
out of her cage.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.085
This is a bad omen.

11:36.087 --> 11:38.921
We are totally going to lose
this game.

11:38.923 --> 11:40.522
Oh, nice!

11:40.524 --> 11:42.791
Dunphy's seriously one of
the best quarterbacks we've had.

11:42.793 --> 11:45.294
I mean, he's not
as accurate as Jamie.

11:45.296 --> 11:47.396
That's what made
your bro all-statate, but...

11:47.398 --> 11:48.530
He's got a strong arm.

11:48.532 --> 11:49.598
Yup.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.867
How is Jamie?
Still kicking your ass?

11:51.869 --> 11:53.769
[Chuckles] Yeah.

11:53.771 --> 11:56.138
And he's not the only one.

11:56.140 --> 11:59.308
No wonder Matty
was treating me like a leper.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.710
Apparently, I'd really hit
a nerve when I gave him

12:01.712 --> 12:03.445
a hard time at my party.

12:03.447 --> 12:07.516
Maybe I deserved to spend
my birthday alone.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.385
I have to go.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here

12:20.530 --> 12:23.632
Jenna! Wait, Jenna!

12:23.634 --> 12:25.367
Jenna, I wanted to apologize
for calling you out

12:25.369 --> 12:27.336
in the caf.

12:27.338 --> 12:28.437
Honestly, I-I didn't think

12:28.439 --> 12:32.641
you'd want to miss your cake.

12:32.643 --> 12:34.276
Listen, you transparent
social climber.

12:34.278 --> 12:36.245
Just because you can't
make your own friends

12:36.247 --> 12:39.214
doesn't mean
you can snake mine.

12:39.216 --> 12:42.351
The only reason Matty and Jake
can stand being around you

12:42.353 --> 12:44.453
is because they feel
sorry for you.

12:44.455 --> 12:45.954
I mean...Look at you.

12:45.956 --> 12:48.524
You're like something a
desperate celebrity would adopt

12:48.526 --> 12:51.226
from a third world country.

12:51.228 --> 12:54.530
Happy Birthday.
Cheers!

12:54.532 --> 12:55.731
Sorry.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.333
Having been emotionally raped
by the day,

12:58.335 --> 13:01.136
I was numb to sadie's
harsh words.

13:01.138 --> 13:03.906
Or maybe it was the crushed ice
melting in my bra.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.709
[Crowd cheering]

13:06.711 --> 13:09.878
It's her birthday.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.281
You're welcome.

13:16.052 --> 13:19.855
[Crowd laughing]

13:24.803 --> 13:26.428
Hey mom, it's me.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.064
Okay, call me when you get this
or just come pick me up.

13:29.066 --> 13:33.001
In case you're wondering,
I am calling from hell.

13:33.003 --> 13:35.570
Hey, nice moves, Hamilton.
Where's your boyfriend?

13:35.572 --> 13:36.938
He's picking me up
in his chariot.

13:36.940 --> 13:38.106
[Chuckles]

13:38.108 --> 13:40.509
You, uh--you need a ride
to the after party?

13:40.511 --> 13:42.611
It's a private party.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.312
I'm cool.

13:44.314 --> 13:46.348
Matty's not going either,
so he could give you a ride.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.149
That's okay. My mom
should be here any minute.

13:48.151 --> 13:49.651
Nah, Mckibben,
take the girl home.

13:49.653 --> 13:52.087
Butt out, rosati.

13:52.089 --> 13:54.956
She said she wants
to wait for her mommy.

13:54.958 --> 13:57.592
Did you fail
your driver's test?

13:57.594 --> 13:59.528
I'll give you a ride.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.937
So just stay straight up here.

14:08.939 --> 14:10.639
- Yeah, I got it.
- And then just take a--

14:10.641 --> 14:15.176
- I know where you live.

14:15.178 --> 14:16.545
So...

14:16.547 --> 14:18.647
I'm sorry about what I said
to you at my party.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.881
I didn't mean it, okay?

14:19.883 --> 14:20.882
I don't think you're
too good for me.

14:20.884 --> 14:24.386
It's okay.
You were right.

14:24.388 --> 14:26.221
I mean, I don't think
I'm too good for you,

14:26.223 --> 14:30.258
but I do care too much
about what other people think.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.893
Everybody does.

14:31.895 --> 14:33.962
That's the thing, Jenna.
You don't.

14:33.964 --> 14:37.098
That's why it
bummed me out because...

14:37.100 --> 14:38.300
You said it.

14:38.302 --> 14:40.368
It kills me that you
think of me that way.

14:40.370 --> 14:42.604
I don't.

14:42.606 --> 14:44.906
I know you're a good person.

14:44.908 --> 14:46.174
Can I ask you something?

14:46.176 --> 14:48.176
Yeah.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.544
What's up with those socks?

14:49.546 --> 14:50.579
[Laughs]

14:50.581 --> 14:52.380
- Clown college.
- Uh-huh.

14:52.382 --> 14:53.381
I go at night.

14:53.383 --> 14:56.051
Seriously?

14:56.053 --> 14:58.620
I put them on this morning
for good luck,

14:58.622 --> 15:01.256
and now I am convinced
they're cursed.

15:01.258 --> 15:02.857
Then hand them over.

15:02.859 --> 15:05.594
Come on.

15:05.596 --> 15:08.863
It's about time.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.001
No more bad luck.

15:19.408 --> 15:22.611
So you and me, we're cool?

15:22.613 --> 15:24.679
Yeah, we're good.

15:24.681 --> 15:27.415
Friends?

15:27.417 --> 15:29.384
Totally.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.685
My first birthday wish
had come back

15:30.687 --> 15:32.587
to bite me in the ass.

15:32.589 --> 15:33.822
When I asked
for my friends back,

15:33.824 --> 15:36.558
I should have specified
I wanted Matty back

15:36.560 --> 15:38.193
as the boyfriend variety.

15:38.195 --> 15:39.260
Thanks for the ride.

15:39.262 --> 15:42.564
No problem.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.599
Okay.

15:58.652 --> 16:00.312
Keep your eyes closed.

16:00.314 --> 16:01.514
Sorry for leaving you stranded,

16:01.516 --> 16:03.048
but you will forgive me

16:03.050 --> 16:07.520
when you see
what your birthday gift is.

16:07.522 --> 16:10.304
Happy Birthday!

16:12.226 --> 16:13.526
Isn't it perfect?

16:13.528 --> 16:14.827
Yup.

16:14.829 --> 16:16.228
Perfect...

16:16.230 --> 16:18.264
For entertaining clients
as a highly paid escort.

16:18.266 --> 16:19.965
Okay, check this out.

16:19.967 --> 16:22.234
Sunny.

16:22.236 --> 16:23.802
Sultry.

16:23.804 --> 16:24.803
Oh.

16:24.805 --> 16:27.740
Sordid.
[Giggles]

16:27.742 --> 16:29.275
Cool, huh?

16:29.277 --> 16:30.276
I thought it was about time

16:30.278 --> 16:33.546
that you had
a grown-up bedroom.

16:33.548 --> 16:34.813
Oh, and there's
one more special feature.

16:34.815 --> 16:36.115
- Oh.
- Come on.

16:36.117 --> 16:40.753
Now, lie back.
[Squeals]

16:40.755 --> 16:42.821
[Laughs]

16:43.323 --> 16:45.857
Wanna know the best thing
about having a mirror

16:45.859 --> 16:47.092
on your ceiling?

16:47.094 --> 16:49.227
I can't imagine.

16:49.229 --> 16:51.396
You can do your makeup in bed.

16:51.398 --> 16:54.466
[Gasps]
Oh.

16:54.468 --> 16:59.838
When I was 16, I would have
killed for a bedroom like this.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.208
Thanks, mom.

17:03.210 --> 17:05.377
Oh.

17:05.378 --> 17:09.214
Is that what you wore
on your special day?

17:09.215 --> 17:12.150
There it was.
My mom's birthday insult.

17:12.152 --> 17:15.153
My day was complete.

17:15.155 --> 17:16.387
Where's my stuff?

17:16.390 --> 17:18.623
I put it in that box.

17:18.625 --> 17:21.992
Now, I am gonna
to leave you two alone

17:21.994 --> 17:23.728
to get to know each other.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.763
Happy Birthday!

17:25.766 --> 17:27.898
16 years on the planet,

17:27.901 --> 17:30.047
and all I had to show for it
was one box.

17:30.172 --> 17:31.989
It was time
for a virtual escape.

17:33.928 --> 17:37.766
Straight up pg.
Scandalous.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.617
Hey, sexy.

17:45.619 --> 17:46.618
What's the problem?

17:46.620 --> 17:47.786
You are my problem.

17:47.788 --> 17:49.754
I've been raging
against my best friend,

17:49.756 --> 17:50.789
and letting you off the hook

17:50.791 --> 17:52.290
when you're just as guilty.

17:52.292 --> 17:55.193
So, stop flirting with me,
stop texting me,

17:55.195 --> 17:56.628
don't ever look at me again

17:56.630 --> 17:58.797
unless you're waiting for
a flute cue from Mr. roboto.

17:58.799 --> 18:00.298
I don't want your skinny ass

18:00.300 --> 18:01.933
in my life anymore,
Ricky Schwartz!

18:01.935 --> 18:07.239
This flirtationship is over.
Game over.

18:07.241 --> 18:10.208
You're so hot right now.

18:19.218 --> 18:21.920
[Sobbing]
Awesome.

18:21.922 --> 18:22.921
It took her awhile,

18:22.923 --> 18:24.756
but Molly ringwald
figured it out.

18:24.758 --> 18:26.758
Lesson learned.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.160
You shouldn't be afraid
to be who you are

18:28.162 --> 18:29.861
because even hot guys
will like you

18:29.863 --> 18:32.130
if you like yourself.

18:32.132 --> 18:35.066
Clearly, I had been going
about things all wrong.

18:35.068 --> 18:37.736
How was I supposed to be
accepted by everybody else

18:37.738 --> 18:40.805
when I hadn't even
accepted myself?

18:44.911 --> 18:47.546
"Jenna, as you are now,
you could disappear,

18:47.548 --> 18:49.281
and no one would notice."

18:49.283 --> 18:53.084
Truth was sometimes
I wanted to disappear.

18:53.086 --> 18:58.623
But I wasn't going to.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.358
I thought 16
was setting itself up

19:00.360 --> 19:02.627
to be the worst year
of my life.

19:02.629 --> 19:05.096
But I was born on 7:32 P.M.,

19:05.098 --> 19:08.300
which meant I was still 15.

19:08.302 --> 19:11.436
[Knocking on door]

19:24.784 --> 19:28.753
I forgot something.

19:28.755 --> 19:32.557
Happy Birthday.

19:35.528 --> 19:37.128
What happened to your room?

19:37.130 --> 19:38.096
[Chuckles]

19:38.098 --> 19:40.799
My mother.

19:40.801 --> 19:45.837
It gets better.

19:45.839 --> 19:47.706
Your mom did this?

19:47.708 --> 19:51.509
Don't ask me to explain
because I can't.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.048
I lied to you in the car.

20:00.953 --> 20:06.658
I don't want to be friends.

20:06.660 --> 20:10.028
I want to be more.

20:15.368 --> 20:18.003
