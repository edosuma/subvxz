00:05.573 --> 00:08.374
She wants Henri
on the throne,

00:08.376 --> 00:09.992
not his older brother.

00:09.993 --> 00:11.609
Leeza will allow Charles
to remain king

00:11.612 --> 00:13.712
while Henri's delayed.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.448
I feared that Mary's wedding
would empower other nations.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.250
She could invade!
If she does,

she will not find you alone.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.588
If the Protestants of
Clan Hamilton agree

own feelings,

Instead, he now treats me

04:30.704 --> 04:32.638

he shows the furniture.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.519
I'm turning her

Well, if only

07:41.028 --> 07:43.161
that were enough for Leeza,
queen of Spain

07:43.163 --> 07:45.130
and of meddling
in French politics.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.998
She still wants Charles
off the throne.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.836
She believes that Henri is
the man to keep France Catholic.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.805
The Protestants have been
troublesome of late.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.140
A firm hand is needed.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.708
Well, a firm hand
will be needed

07:56.710 --> 07:58.877
to keep my sons
from each other's throats.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.947
And after agreeing
to let me handle matters,

08:01.949 --> 08:05.217
Leeza went behind my back and
she wrote to Henri directly.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.052
And he is on his way here now,

08:07.054 --> 08:09.554
fresh from his latest defeat
of the Turks,

08:09.556 --> 08:11.790
aware that Spain wants him
on the throne.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.625
Toppling the Turks.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.795
You know, I have to say,
he does sound impressive.

08:16.797 --> 08:17.863
He's ambitious.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.564
And Charles,

08:19.566 --> 08:21.132
he's no match for
his younger brother.

08:21.134 --> 08:25.103
Nicole must get him
to willingly abdicate

08:25.105 --> 08:27.806
and disappear
from the world's stage.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.809
And once he does, we must pray
that the people accept it,

08:30.811 --> 08:31.877
and leave him in peace,

08:31.879 --> 08:34.880
because I cannot survive
the loss

08:34.882 --> 08:36.715
of another son.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.222
NICOLE:
It's gorgeous.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.195
There is another
reason for my visit.

08:50.197 --> 08:55.000
Hmm.
An important task for you,
regarding Charles.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.135
It won't be easy, but

08:57.137 --> 08:59.070
you will be well rewarded.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.306
A country chateau of which
you will have full control--

09:01.308 --> 09:03.108
kitchen, staff,

09:03.110 --> 09:05.143
decor.
Go on.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.611
It would be your new home.

09:06.613 --> 09:10.115
Once Charles agrees
to abdicate.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.683
How is that even possible?

09:11.685 --> 09:14.219
Unless Charles leaves court.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.087
Well, he would leave court.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.722
Well, he'd have to go far away,
to remove himself completely

09:17.724 --> 09:18.957
from the public eye.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.792
You really have learned so much.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.694
That's what the chateau is for.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.929
Mm.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.196
He would still be a Valois,

09:25.198 --> 09:27.332
a noble of high rank.
(exhales shakily)

09:27.334 --> 09:29.200

09:29.202 --> 09:33.071
well, you would have
your every need fulfilled.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.774
It's more than you could
possibly have dreamed of.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.579
I dreamt that I'd be
the first of my family

09:40.581 --> 09:42.113
to escape that dreary farm.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.149
That I'd meet
someone like you,

09:44.151 --> 09:45.250
who would initiate me
to the excitement

09:45.252 --> 09:46.618
and intrigue of court.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.985
I don't want to
go off into hiding

09:47.988 --> 09:50.221
with some weak, fallen king.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.223
I want to be in
the thick of things.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.658
With you.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.960
With me?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.362
I've fallen for you.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.899
I love you.
I need you

10:00.901 --> 10:02.233
to save a king's life.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.670
You must convince
Charles to abdicate.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.205
Which means going away with him.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.677
You don't care about me at all.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.813
I could. I might.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.248
But we have an arrangement.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.150
Which is now utterly

10:19.152 --> 10:21.186
and completely over.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.187
Nicole...

10:22.189 --> 10:23.688
You hurt me.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.123
I'm done helping you,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.958
and the monarchy,
and France.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.126

10:28.128 --> 10:29.628

<i> Lord Hamilton,</i>

I'm pleased
you're here.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.190
And what
of your Catholic husband,

13:12.192 --> 13:14.192
the king consort?

13:14.194 --> 13:15.994
Where is he?

13:15.996 --> 13:19.964
His absence suggests he does
not share in your... pleasure.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.300
Lord Darnley is busy with
matters regarding the Crown.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.536
But we are
of one mind:

13:24.538 --> 13:26.371
to move forward, one nation,

13:26.373 --> 13:29.474
Catholics and Protestants
united.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.476
Then perhaps
you should have married me

13:31.478 --> 13:33.411
instead of a Catholic.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.513
Imagine it:
you, Catholic,

13:35.515 --> 13:38.483
me, Protestant, both with a
claim to the Scottish throne.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.885
There is the unity you speak of.

13:40.887 --> 13:43.388
But I'm looking beyond Scotland,

13:43.390 --> 13:44.522
to England.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.224
And you can help me.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.159
If you stand with me

13:48.161 --> 13:49.194
at Lord Darnley's coronation,

13:49.196 --> 13:50.395
it will show both faiths

13:50.397 --> 13:52.497
that we share a common goal.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.066
You're asking me to turn my back
on my family,

13:55.068 --> 13:57.502
ignore a hundred years
of animosity

13:57.504 --> 13:59.337
that exists
between Lord Darnley's family

13:59.339 --> 14:01.072
and mine.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.173
What's in it for me?

14:04.411 --> 14:07.412
I am willing to restore
the Hamilton family's seat

14:07.414 --> 14:08.479
on the privy council.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.382
You would do this?

14:12.385 --> 14:13.952
Allow me to influence policy,

14:13.954 --> 14:15.486
knowing my hatred
for Lord Darnley?

14:15.488 --> 14:18.323
I am interested in the future,

14:18.325 --> 14:19.557
not the past.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.092
It is a generous offer,

14:21.094 --> 14:23.328
and one that I encourage you

14:23.330 --> 14:24.462
to accept.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.498
I will consider it.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.237
James?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.305
May I speak with you?

14:34.307 --> 14:35.506
I'm just heading out.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.641
Can it wait until...

14:36.643 --> 14:38.376
No. It will only take a moment.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.113
At Mary's wedding,
there were things said,

14:42.115 --> 14:43.848
by me,

14:43.849 --> 14:45.582
that I'm afraid have made you
uncomfortable around me.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.419
I'm sorry, Greer. If I've
treated you differently, it's--

14:48.421 --> 14:51.422
it's only because I've been
preoccupied with my duties.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.057
And preoccupied with Emily Knox.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.160
Do you care for her, James?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.528
I only press the issue
because Mary said

14:57.530 --> 14:58.463
things aren't always
as they seem.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.530
And I realize...

15:01.501 --> 15:03.334
...love doesn't need to be
a thing of the past for me.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.970
Not if I am clear
about what I want.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.972
Who I want.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.409
Greer, my life is...

15:11.411 --> 15:12.410
complicated.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.479
I hope it will
not always be,

15:14.481 --> 15:16.648
but for now, it is.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.617
I'm sorry.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.004
Be patient with me.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.073
Please.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.247
PRIEST:
<i> I baptize thee</i>

15:49.249 --> 15:51.249
in the name of the Father,

15:51.251 --> 15:53.451
and of the Son,

15:53.453 --> 15:55.153

(grunting)

16:02.729 --> 16:05.596
(gasping)

16:05.598 --> 16:08.399
See that this message
reaches King Charles,

16:08.401 --> 16:09.634
or this church

16:09.636 --> 16:12.337
will become your child's grave.
Now run!

16:14.107 --> 16:15.606
CATHERINE:
<i> If Charles doesn't release</i>

16:15.608 --> 16:17.041
the Protestant prisoners
listed here,

16:17.043 --> 16:19.277
they'll start killing
the Catholic hostages,

16:19.279 --> 16:20.545
one by one.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.213
Please, do as they ask.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.715
My entire family
is in that church,

16:23.717 --> 16:25.283
my baby boy.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.751
We will speak with the king.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.252
And he will respond.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.522
This is worse than I feared.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.523
The<i> gall.</i>

16:32.525 --> 16:35.059
We need to crush them.

16:35.061 --> 16:37.595
Charles has balked at this sort
of military action in the past,

16:37.597 --> 16:39.564
especially against Protestants.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.399
Well, Henri would have
no such hesitation.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.633
But as Charles is king,

16:42.635 --> 16:44.569
only he can authorize
a military strike.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.271
Has Nicole spoken with him
about abdicating?

16:47.273 --> 16:48.306
(sighs)
No.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.607
You said
you had her in hand.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.541
That was before she decided

16:50.543 --> 16:52.243
she was in love with me.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.445
(sighs)
I tried to hedge
my response, but...

16:54.447 --> 16:56.547
But now what? Hmm?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.116
She's brokenhearted and angry.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.118
(sighs)
Well, the answer is simple.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.486
You must seduce her,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.121
convince her that
you could love her.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.589
You're very good at that.
(sighs)

17:06.493 --> 17:09.060
Or you used to be.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.395
What is holding you back?

17:11.698 --> 17:12.797
Charles needs guidance.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.465
You know that he will
want to give in

17:14.467 --> 17:15.666
to the Protestants' demands.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.402
If we appear weak,

17:17.404 --> 17:21.806
we are one step closer
to civil war.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.674
(church bell tolls)
Another hour passes.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.143
It is time to
show your king

17:25.145 --> 17:26.611
that our threats

17:26.613 --> 17:28.079
are to be taken seriously.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.580
(church bell tolls)

17:29.582 --> 17:32.316
(grunting)
(woman screaming)

17:32.318 --> 17:34.752
(scattered yelling)

17:40.493 --> 17:41.692
How could you
invite the Hamiltons here

17:41.694 --> 17:44.162
knowing our history?
I explained my reasons.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.196
After it is done.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.497
After they are comfortably

17:46.499 --> 17:48.099
within the walls of our home.
(slaps table)

17:48.101 --> 17:51.202
The very people
who murdered my grandfather!

17:51.204 --> 17:52.804
I have heard enough about the
bad blood between your families.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.173
This feud will never
end, unless somebody

17:55.175 --> 17:56.574
is willing to be the better man.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.177
I am asking you to be that man.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.511
Then you are asking
to be disappointed.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.081
We need their Protestant
support.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.283
It is support that
they are unlikely to give.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.284
I think they will.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.786
I have offered Lord Hamilton

18:08.788 --> 18:10.154
a seat on the privy council.

18:11.091 --> 18:14.225
A seat on the privy council?

18:14.227 --> 18:16.761
Why don't you just hand him
your throne, as well?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.129
The same ambition
that drove the Hamiltons

18:18.131 --> 18:19.664
to take my grandfather's life

18:19.666 --> 18:21.299
could drive them to take yours.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.600
And since you refused me

18:22.602 --> 18:24.569
the Crown Matrimonial,

18:24.571 --> 18:27.238
they will stake
their own claim to rule.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.473
You are determined to paint them
as murderers.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.674
And you

18:29.676 --> 18:30.842
should have discussed this
with me!

18:30.844 --> 18:32.176
I'm your husband, I'm your king!

18:32.178 --> 18:33.544
Not just some figurehead!

18:36.449 --> 18:37.849
What am I saying?

18:37.851 --> 18:39.150
Of course,

18:39.152 --> 18:40.318
that's all I am to you.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.753
I didn't want it to be
like this.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.422
I had hoped
that our marriage

18:44.424 --> 18:46.157
would be a partnership
in every way.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.126
But with your drinking,
your cheating,

18:48.128 --> 18:49.293
your blind ambition...

18:49.295 --> 18:50.795
I am trying to be better!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.363
Then try harder.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.600
I mean it, Darnley.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.135
If the Hamiltons stay

18:57.137 --> 18:58.302
for your coronation,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.171
you cannot let them provoke you

19:00.173 --> 19:01.205
to anger or violence.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.174
A better partner,

19:03.176 --> 19:04.709
a better king
knows that sometimes,

19:04.711 --> 19:08.312
we must do things we hate
for the sake of the Crown.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.751
(scoffs)

19:15.188 --> 19:16.220
(door opens)

19:16.222 --> 19:17.788
(sighs)

19:17.790 --> 19:19.490
(door closes)

19:21.594 --> 19:22.593
GIDEON:
The archduke of Austria

19:22.595 --> 19:24.262
seemed like a nice fellow.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.764
He's a little bit
fancy for my taste.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.800
Well, he was very handsome.

19:29.802 --> 19:33.304
With a long, powerful stride.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.340
I was practically breathless
trying to keep up with him.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.475
Stride is what one looks for
in a horse,

19:37.477 --> 19:38.609
not a husband.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.179
I prefer to match my pace

19:41.181 --> 19:42.413
to my partner's.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.783
I may take things
more slowly, but...

19:45.785 --> 19:48.619
you will still
find yourself

19:48.621 --> 19:50.488
breathless.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.431
Oh, wait.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.966
I forgot to bring the...

20:01.968 --> 20:03.334
Oh, it doesn't matter.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.936
You are a queen

20:04.938 --> 20:06.337
looking to make a strategic
marriage alliance.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.306
You can't very well do that

20:08.308 --> 20:09.507
when you're pregnant
with another man's child.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.410
If I can get pregnant at all.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.378
Once I am wed,

20:14.380 --> 20:16.581
I will be expected
to produce an heir

20:16.583 --> 20:18.583
and blamed if I do not.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.218
Getting pregnant
before I'm married

20:20.220 --> 20:21.319
might not be
the worst idea.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.455
If I am barren,

20:24.457 --> 20:26.958
there's no reason to give up
half my throne.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.176
If you do get pregnant...

20:28.177 --> 20:29.393
I could be married
within a week.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.861
With my child.
No one will know.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.296
What, and that makes it better?

20:32.298 --> 20:33.531
I'm just your stud horse,

20:33.533 --> 20:35.433
testing your fertility?

20:35.435 --> 20:36.601
I'm sorry,
I just thought that...

20:36.603 --> 20:38.636
I know this is
meant to be

20:38.637 --> 20:40.670
a relationship of convenience
and nothing more, but...

20:42.375 --> 20:43.808
...what we share has--

20:43.810 --> 20:46.344
has quite unexpectedly
become very personal to me.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.678
I appreciate that's
not what you need

20:47.680 --> 20:49.880
right now. Or want.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.482
I'm sorry for that.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.685
(door opens)

20:54.687 --> 20:56.420
NICOLE:
Are you here to lavish me

20:56.422 --> 20:57.371
with more gifts

20:57.372 --> 20:58.321
and then send me away to rot?

20:58.324 --> 21:00.424
You are the only one at court

21:00.426 --> 21:01.525
who has the king's heart.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.327
That makes you
very special.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.396
Charles needs you now.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.399
There is a very delicate
situation at Vendome.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.268
Protestants have
taken hostages.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.602
I thought I made it clear.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.305
Our arrangement is off.

21:14.307 --> 21:17.441
I won't do anything for a
man who only seeks to use me.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.277
Nicole...

21:19.279 --> 21:21.646
I need to apologize.

21:21.648 --> 21:25.283
You<i> have</i> come
to mean something to me.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.385
You're just saying that now
to get what you want.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.388
It's what I want that pains me.

21:36.362 --> 21:39.664
I had a wife
who was killed.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.499
Lola.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.968
Yes.
Of course.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.304
Why didn't I realize?

21:46.306 --> 21:50.074
Because you're young
and still so innocent.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.976
Being with you

21:51.978 --> 21:55.313
feels like a betrayal...

21:55.315 --> 21:58.482
Because you love me, too?

21:58.484 --> 22:01.018
I don't want to.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.787
The truth is that...

22:02.789 --> 22:06.490
I cannot erase you from my mind.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.738
(Nicole moans)

22:21.908 --> 22:24.075
CHARLES:
<i> I have deemed</i>

22:24.077 --> 22:26.410
that immediate
military action is required

22:26.412 --> 22:28.846
to quash the Protestant
insurgents in Vendome,

22:28.848 --> 22:30.681
and save innocent lives.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.451
France will not tolerate
such blatant and aggressive

22:33.453 --> 22:35.419
defiance of the Crown
and its laws.

22:35.421 --> 22:36.554
MAN:
Very wise,

22:36.556 --> 22:37.588
Your Majesty.
Excellent.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.891
Well done, Nicole.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.394
She's good in bed,
and she can turn on

22:43.396 --> 22:44.929
the tears as well
as the praise.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.465
And well done you.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.400
I was starting to think
you didn't have it in you.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.869
Oh, I played her masterfully.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.770
Hmm.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.472
And all it cost me

22:54.474 --> 22:56.707
was the desecration
of Lola's memory.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.877
But that doesn't mean
anything to you, does it?

23:02.548 --> 23:03.948
(horse whinnying,
dog barking)

23:03.950 --> 23:05.649
JAMES:
<i>Emily, tell me what's happened.</i>

23:05.651 --> 23:08.552
My husband knows about us.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.787
(sighs)

23:09.789 --> 23:13.891
And I know
you were only using me.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.029
And I hate you.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.866
More than I thought possible.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.503
But I need you.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.004
My husband says
he forgives me,

23:27.006 --> 23:29.707
but he treats me worse
than a common whore.

23:29.709 --> 23:32.843
I am forced to sleep and eat
with the animals.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.578
And I am beat

23:34.580 --> 23:35.746
with the same rod.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.481
Emily, I'm sorry.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.717
Tell me how I can help.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.555
You took my life from me,

23:44.557 --> 23:46.991
and now you will
find me another.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.559
Away from my husband,

23:48.561 --> 23:51.562
away from you,

23:51.564 --> 23:53.764
away from anyone
who knows my shame.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.000
Emily, that's-that's not
something I can do.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.602
Because you fear
my husband, too.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.037
But you know people in France.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.107
Get me there. I have information
that will make it

24:03.109 --> 24:06.677
worth whatever retribution
you face from him.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.547
Something horrible is going
to happen to Mary.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.915
Tell me what it is,

24:10.917 --> 24:12.750
and I will get you away
from here, I promise.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.618
Tomorrow,

24:14.620 --> 24:16.754
before the coronation,

24:16.756 --> 24:21.692
Lord Hamilton has plotted
with my husband to kill Mary.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.577
<i> (knocking on door)</i>

24:39.579 --> 24:42.780
You must be Lord Darnley.

24:42.782 --> 24:43.914
We have not met, Lord Hamilton.
What gave me away?

24:43.916 --> 24:45.049
You have the look
of an Englishman.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.751
And the face of a traitor.

24:47.753 --> 24:50.554
I wish to apologize
for not greeting you earlier.

24:50.556 --> 24:53.090
I also wish to make it
up to you personally

24:53.092 --> 24:55.693
by inviting you to stay
for my coronation.

24:55.695 --> 24:58.062
Oh, my, aren't you a good lad,
doing your wife's bidding.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.930
I can't help but think
how different things would be

24:59.932 --> 25:01.131
if the queen had married me.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.067
She'd be pregnant by now,
that's for certain.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.535
We are working on it.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.170
Working?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.005
If Mary were in my bed,
I assure you

25:08.007 --> 25:09.673
she would not consider it work.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.609
Anyway, no need
to feel pressure.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.944
If you fail to produce an heir,
well, my family,

25:13.946 --> 25:16.046
as next in line, is more
than ready to step in.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.115
Lord Hamilton,

25:18.117 --> 25:19.583
might we not set aside

25:19.585 --> 25:20.851
our differences?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.253
Think of what could accomplish

25:22.255 --> 25:24.522
if we supported our queen
and country together.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.690
Hmm. Perhaps.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.260
How long can we really resent
one another for the tension

25:29.262 --> 25:31.128
that existed between
our grandfathers, anyway?

25:32.665 --> 25:34.832
In truth,
it was more than tension.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.601
Your family murdered
my grandfather.

25:37.603 --> 25:41.105
Your grandfather was a traitor.
And your grandfather
was a bastard.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.240
By birth.
Who persecuted Protestants,

25:43.242 --> 25:45.009
and then became one.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.277
A Catholic who becomes
a Protestant

25:46.279 --> 25:48.679
still serves the same God.

25:48.681 --> 25:51.882
A Scot who becomes an Englishman
loses his soul.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.217
Like your father.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.556
I've taken up
enough of your time.

25:58.558 --> 25:59.957
I do hope

25:59.959 --> 26:01.659
that you will accept
Mary's offer

26:01.661 --> 26:03.827
of a seat on the privy council.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.162
If I do,

26:05.164 --> 26:07.598
it will be to block
your every move.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.233
I'll turn the privy council
against you

26:09.235 --> 26:11.168
and render you powerless,
so everyone can see

26:11.170 --> 26:14.138
what a weak and impotent man
you truly are.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.706
And I'll laugh.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.141
Like my grandfather
must've laughed

26:17.143 --> 26:19.109
when he slit
your grandfather's throat.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.645
(inhales sharply)
A gift from the future

26:21.647 --> 26:24.081
king of Scotland to one
of his loyal subjects.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.850
You've probably poisoned it.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.592
Prince Erik, too powerful.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.827
Duke of Savoy, too powerless.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.229
Count Alejandro, too dull;

26:39.231 --> 26:42.266
Alfonso D'Este, too... lumpy?

26:42.268 --> 26:43.901
Elizabeth, these are all
viable marriage candidates.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.235
You need to take
this seriously.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.270
Uh...

26:46.272 --> 26:49.173
Gideon, about last night...

26:49.175 --> 26:51.108
Oh, I apologize for my outburst.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.110
But I do believe
it is best that we

26:53.112 --> 26:55.179
return to things
as they once were--

26:55.181 --> 26:57.648
you, my Queen and I,
your advisor.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.817
Nothing more.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.218
Um, what about the
archduke of Austria?

27:01.220 --> 27:02.686
You said you liked his...

27:02.688 --> 27:05.255
stride.
I don't want the archduke.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.091
He's a Catholic,
a good fit both politically,

27:07.093 --> 27:09.193
strategically...
I don't want any of them.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.828
Then who do you want?
You.

27:12.898 --> 27:15.332
What I want,

27:15.334 --> 27:17.368
and what I need,

27:17.370 --> 27:19.670
is you.

27:19.672 --> 27:22.072
Since last night,
I have done little

27:22.074 --> 27:24.174
but think about
what my life would be like

27:24.176 --> 27:26.844
if we were not together.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.880
A life where I would
see you every day

27:29.882 --> 27:32.883
and know that I would
not feel your touch at night.

27:32.885 --> 27:35.919
A life where I
would be unloved

27:35.921 --> 27:40.324
and unknown as only you love

27:40.326 --> 27:42.893
and know me.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.763
And it is not a life I desire.

27:45.765 --> 27:49.400
This is personal for me,
as well.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.042
No explosions from Darnley.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.743
I know I have you
to thank for that.

27:59.745 --> 28:01.278
Well, except for a moment
when he asked me

28:01.280 --> 28:02.946
to check on alterations
being made to the crown,

28:02.948 --> 28:04.248
I was with him all day.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.883
If it all goes according
to plan,

28:05.885 --> 28:08.252
by this time tomorrow,
Darnley will have his crown,

28:08.254 --> 28:10.320
and the Hamiltons will have
their seat on the privy council.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.323
Here's to you taking
Elizabeth's throne.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.893
(door opens)
Mary,

28:15.895 --> 28:17.361
you must come with me, quickly.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.196
There's a plot
against your life.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.066
Knox incited the
Hamiltons to stage a coup.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.333
I've sent guards
to arrest the Hamiltons,

28:23.335 --> 28:25.035
but they're not
in their chambers.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.970
Until they're located,
we must leave the castle.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.839
Now.
Greer, you come with me.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.874
David, find Darnley.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.110
He needs to be taken
to safety as well.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.080
(Hamilton laughs)

28:39.218 --> 28:41.218
Stay back.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.020
Halt.

28:43.022 --> 28:46.390
Stand where you are
and surrender your weapons.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.459
What have we done?

28:48.461 --> 28:51.995
Are we not allowed to leave if
we desire female companionship?

28:51.997 --> 28:54.298
I will ask one more time.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.767
Remove your weapons
and lay them on the floor.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.069
You are under arrest

28:59.071 --> 29:01.271
for treason
and conspiracy to assassinate

29:01.273 --> 29:02.439
the queen.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.318
(grunts)

29:14.320 --> 29:16.386
(men grunting)

29:18.157 --> 29:19.757
(man cries out)

29:19.759 --> 29:22.159
(grunting continues)

29:38.277 --> 29:40.310
(whimpering)

29:40.312 --> 29:41.979
(Hamilton coughs)

29:41.981 --> 29:43.947
So...

29:43.949 --> 29:45.816
Knox was right.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.251
You meant to kill us
all along.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.954
Is that what he told you?

29:50.956 --> 29:52.289
Is that
why you wouldn't disarm?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.159
He said it was a trap.
I didn't believe him.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.961
MARY:
My God, no.
We can't let him die.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.296
He's the only one
that can prove Knox has been

29:59.298 --> 30:01.064
feeding us all lies.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.432
Greer, fetch the physician.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.969
(panting):
No.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.471
Mary, he won't make it.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.482
Emily told me once
she was a terrible liar.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.284
She's quite good, actually.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.152
I believed her.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.288
You will never know
Emily's motives.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.557
Knox may have given her
no choice.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.525
May have threatened her
very life if she refused

30:28.527 --> 30:30.561
to feed you false information
about the Hamiltons.

30:30.563 --> 30:33.831
And now, because we were unable
to save Lord Hamilton,

30:33.833 --> 30:36.366
Knox is free to say that
you lured them to the castle,

30:36.368 --> 30:39.336
powerful Protestants
to the slaughter.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.121
He'll preach of your treachery.

30:41.122 --> 30:42.905
I will lose all hope
of Protestant support.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.044
Unless someone else
takes the blame.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.379
James, no.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.181
It is because of me that
you're in this trouble, Mary.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.549
You must hold me accountable.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.318
But it's because of me
that you slept with Emily

30:54.320 --> 30:56.320
in the first place.
Mary,

30:56.322 --> 30:58.922
to take England,
to hold Scotland,

30:58.924 --> 31:01.391
you must say that
I acted on my own.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.927
You must ban me
from Scotland.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.030
Make me a public spectacle
so that all will hear of it.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.499
You shouldn't have to do this.

31:10.636 --> 31:14.438
You are a good
and fair queen, sister.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.406
Your people need you.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.609
My only regret is that I will
no longer be able to serve

31:18.611 --> 31:21.879
at your side,
and protect you.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.648
Only for a time.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.617
I will call you back, James.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.923
What am I going
to do without you?

31:32.925 --> 31:34.591
JAMES:
Summon Lord Bothwell.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.894
I know he would rather die
than see you harmed.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.462
You can't rely

31:38.464 --> 31:40.898
on Darnley for this,
it's too important.

31:42.635 --> 31:45.269
MARY:
<i> Tell me, Mrs. Knox,</i>

31:45.271 --> 31:48.105
When you told James that
the Hamiltons intended me harm,

31:48.107 --> 31:49.673
did you know
it was a lie,

31:49.675 --> 31:51.208
even as you spoke it?

31:51.210 --> 31:53.443
It is no worse than
lies he has told me.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.514
Why don't you kill me now?

31:57.516 --> 32:00.150
You've destroyed
my life anyway.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.152
I may still need you,

32:02.154 --> 32:04.154
to connect your husband
to the slaughter.

32:04.156 --> 32:07.691
His followers believe
he is God's messenger.

32:07.693 --> 32:11.161
Anything you do to him
will only make him a martyr.

32:15.301 --> 32:18.168
You have cost me much, Emily.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.537
But something tells me

32:20.539 --> 32:23.640
there is some truth
in your lies

32:23.642 --> 32:25.142
about the way you live, hmm?

32:26.679 --> 32:28.679
Go home

32:28.681 --> 32:31.148
to the powerful man
who knows

32:31.150 --> 32:32.983
that you betrayed him.

32:32.985 --> 32:36.553
Enjoy the living hell
that is your marriage.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.622
That is your punishment.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.593
NARCISSE:
Your Majesty.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.463
It has just been
confirmed--

32:46.465 --> 32:47.597
the attack on the rebels
has been executed.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.433
And the hostages?

32:49.435 --> 32:51.601
Thanks to your quick action,
they are saved.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.603
But at what cost?

32:53.605 --> 32:56.173
How many gallant soldiers
did I send to their deaths?

32:56.175 --> 32:59.710
Charles, come
with me, please.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.345
There's something
you need to see.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.990
You helped Charles
find the strength

33:12.992 --> 33:14.725
to do the right thing.

33:14.727 --> 33:18.095
You saved lives today.

33:21.266 --> 33:23.400
I did it for you.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.006
(people cheering)

33:29.008 --> 33:31.174
WOMAN:
Charles, the savior of France!

33:31.176 --> 33:33.744
It's all right,
you are their hero.

33:33.746 --> 33:35.612
They're calling me
their savior.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.748
They love you.

33:37.750 --> 33:40.183
(cheers and applause)

33:49.661 --> 33:52.696
Is that...
My son.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.064
What's his name?

33:54.066 --> 33:55.465
Charles.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.434
Named after the king
who saved his life.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.239
I wish Leeza were here
to see this.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.408
NARCISSE:
Charles, a Catholic king

34:04.410 --> 34:05.675
embraced by his people.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.778
Oh, I'll make sure
she knows.

34:07.780 --> 34:10.313
And perhaps this turn
of events

34:10.315 --> 34:13.183
will get her to stop
interfering in French affairs,

34:13.185 --> 34:15.452
and let us live
in peace.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.054
I wouldn't go that far.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.690
She is your daughter,
after all.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.793
Perhaps this will
buy us some room.

34:22.795 --> 34:25.462
Yes, giving us time to
secure Charles' reign.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.731
If we can keep
his hand steady,

34:27.733 --> 34:29.299
he won't need
to abdicate.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.501
Henri might not be
too happy about that.

34:31.503 --> 34:35.505
We can't have him
contesting the throne.

34:35.507 --> 34:39.676
Not when his brother is
finally embracing being king.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.379
And as long as Nicole thinks
she has your love,

34:42.381 --> 34:45.715
We can use her
to control Charles.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.718
For the good
of France, of course.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.722
For the good of France.

34:52.724 --> 34:56.093
Lord James Stuart,
Earl of Moray,

34:56.095 --> 34:58.261
for your egregious crimes,

34:58.263 --> 35:00.730
you are hereby banished
from Scotland.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.733
Furthermore, your lands
and titles are forfeits

35:03.735 --> 35:06.403
to the Crown, your wealth
stripped from your person

35:06.405 --> 35:08.872
as you leave in disgrace.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.585
Wait.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.217
(horse neighs)

36:04.229 --> 36:07.797
How many more people
will you sacrifice?

36:07.799 --> 36:10.200
Was there no other way?

36:23.615 --> 36:25.415
Don't go.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.616
I have work.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.718
Or should I tell
the privy council

36:28.720 --> 36:31.555
that the queen's needs
are more pressing?

36:31.557 --> 36:34.424
Fine. You're released.
(chuckles)

36:34.426 --> 36:35.959
Shall I write
to the archduke

36:35.961 --> 36:37.494
to officially initiate
courtship proceedings?

36:37.496 --> 36:39.229
It's all right.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.831
For England's sake,
you still need a husband.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.600
I understand that.

36:43.602 --> 36:44.935
But I don't want
to lose you.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.937
You won't.

36:46.939 --> 36:49.940
I've traveled this path before.

36:49.942 --> 36:53.443
It won't be easy
standing on the sidelines,

36:53.445 --> 36:55.445
seeing me
with someone else.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.847
You will want
a love of your own.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.250
It's very complicated.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.519
I'm not Dudley.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.622
I expect no more
than what we enjoy now.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.258
It will not be
enough for you.
It is.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.594
If our love
must be secret,

37:10.596 --> 37:12.229
and our child, so long
that it is loved,

37:12.231 --> 37:16.233
never know its father,
then... so be it.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.236
At least I'll be
a part of your life.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.005
The most precious part.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.981
(swords clanging)

37:32.751 --> 37:34.684
(grunting)

37:38.390 --> 37:39.723
(Catherine laughs)

37:39.725 --> 37:42.259
You're getting good
at this.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.628
Well, I'll have to be
a great swordsman

37:44.630 --> 37:47.264
if I want to lead France
to victory on the battlefield.

37:47.266 --> 37:49.266
And you're no longer afraid
of that responsibility?

37:49.268 --> 37:51.368
Not anymore.
I understand that

37:51.370 --> 37:52.569
sometimes a king
must wield a sword

37:52.571 --> 37:53.937
to protect his people.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.438
And your people will
honor you for it,

37:55.440 --> 37:57.040
as they did today.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.942
They loved me.

37:58.944 --> 38:02.045
I can still hear the crowd
chanting my name.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.781
I want it, Mother.
To be king.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.051
I am so proud of you.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.761
(whispering)

38:26.305 --> 38:27.871
Mother.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.406
Looking lovely, as always.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.308
Not exactly the
welcome reception

38:31.310 --> 38:32.709
I was hoping for.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.912
Henri, you must not have
received my letter.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.548
There's been a change
of plan.
Oh.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.016
Leeza said Charles
is unwell,

38:40.018 --> 38:41.584
and I was needed
immediately.

38:41.586 --> 38:44.054
Well, I had hoped
to save you the journey.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.590
Your brother
is quite recovered.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.860
So he's not going
to be abdicating?

38:50.862 --> 38:52.062
No.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.098
Good.

38:56.068 --> 38:57.467
That's a relief.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.905
You're not disappointed?

39:01.907 --> 39:03.673
Charles is my brother,

39:03.675 --> 39:04.974
and the lawful
king of France.

39:04.976 --> 39:09.012
And I'm a prince
who gets to do

39:09.014 --> 39:10.747
whatever he wants.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.416
(sighs)

39:18.357 --> 39:21.057
Welcome home, my son.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.759
(chuckles)

39:35.107 --> 39:36.773
I think we should
keep my coronation

39:36.775 --> 39:38.108
a small, private affair.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.877
This does not feel
like the time

39:40.879 --> 39:43.046
for pomp or pageantry.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.117
I know how much
you were looking forward to it.

39:47.119 --> 39:51.154
I appreciate your understanding
and sacrifice.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.490
Sometimes a ruler must
do things they hate

39:53.492 --> 39:55.125
for the sake of the Crown.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.960
I know his death is
a terrible complication,

39:56.962 --> 39:58.661
but so you know,

39:58.663 --> 40:00.563
I refused to let
Lord Hamilton provoke me.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.732
Though I was tempted,

40:02.734 --> 40:05.034
I found strength
in your challenge

40:05.036 --> 40:07.036
to be a better man.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.739
That is what
I hope to be.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.574
I can take care
of you, Mary,

40:11.576 --> 40:14.110
and I can protect you,

40:14.112 --> 40:16.479
if you will only allow me.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.482
I will consider it.

40:21.153 --> 40:25.422
Might you also consider,
at last,

40:25.424 --> 40:27.590
starting a family with me?

40:31.430 --> 40:33.563
Actually...

40:35.534 --> 40:37.967
...we have already started.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.771
I am pregnant
with your child.

40:45.076 --> 40:48.645
I will be a good father
and a good husband.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.981
On that you have my oath.
