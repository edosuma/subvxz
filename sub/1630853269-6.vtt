00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
'The following programme contains
strong language from the outset.'

00:10.680 --> 00:13.040
'He can't even see you.'
'He can now. I don't know why.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.240
I don't know what's going on.
Maybe he's always seen me.'

00:15.280 --> 00:16.000
Your mum and I have been talking.
It's William Wyatt. What?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.040
Your mum and I have been talking.
It's William Wyatt. What?

00:18.080 --> 00:20.040
William Wyatt killed me,
with his belt.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.400
I've so wanted
to share this with you.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.000
Just sort this out. Come home.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.120
Just sort this out. Come home.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.280
I believe you.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.000
You're embarrassing yourself,
and you're embarrassing Christine.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.920
You're embarrassing yourself,
and you're embarrassing Christine.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.080
I thought you were
supposed to be a friend.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.040
I am. And as her friend, I've never
understood what she saw in you.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.200
What the hell are you doing,
Joseph?!

00:44.240 --> 00:45.360
Stop!

00:49.520 --> 00:51.280
'You gave me GHB.'

00:51.320 --> 00:52.480
Neve!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.000
Oh, my God.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.000
Neve!

01:04.000 --> 01:04.400
Neve!

01:05.800 --> 01:07.000
Neve!

01:07.880 --> 01:10.000
What the fuck just happened?

01:16.600 --> 01:19.680
I know you're upset
but you can't just ignore that.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.800
I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you about the GHB.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.880
I just... I didn't...

01:25.920 --> 01:28.000
I didn't want you to blame yourself.

01:28.000 --> 01:28.280
I didn't want you to blame yourself.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.040
I don't!

01:31.760 --> 01:35.080
You're the only good thing
in my life right now.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.640
Neve! Please don't push me away.
Please, please.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.360
You lied to me.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.000
I didn't lie to you, I just didn't
know how to tell you the truth.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I didn't lie to you, I just didn't
know how to tell you the truth.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.000
And I messed up, OK?
I'm so sorry, I really am.

01:52.000 --> 01:52.640
And I messed up, OK?
I'm so sorry, I really am.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.000
My dad...my murderer...and you.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.520
My dad...my murderer...and you.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.000
Maybe the only people who can see me
are the ones who hurt me the most.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.160
Maybe the only people who can see me
are the ones who hurt me the most.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.000
How are your ribs?

02:24.800 --> 02:27.040
You think anything's broken?

02:27.080 --> 02:28.840
Nothing that can't be fixed.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.200
Oh.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.000
Hello?

02:56.680 --> 02:58.680
Yes, speaking.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.000
What's happened?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.560
What's happened?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.960
They're releasing Neve's body.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.640
there's no better days

03:23.480 --> 03:26.560
until I'm scared of day

03:41.800 --> 03:43.680
We can't let this happen.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.000
Why?

03:47.040 --> 03:50.680
It might change something,
and...I'm not ready.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.000
You've had all this time.
I've not even...

03:52.000 --> 03:54.800
You've had all this time.
I've not even...

03:58.360 --> 04:00.000
I need to speak to her.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.720
I need to speak to her.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.280
I need to see her.
Shh, shh, shh.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.400
I can't lose her again.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.000
What is it? Is she here?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.240
What is it? Is she here?

04:19.120 --> 04:21.040
She's here.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.480
Don't tell her.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.280
Where is she? Neve?

04:28.160 --> 04:31.600
Mum?
We've been talking. She believes me.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.800
She knows you're here.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.160
There. You're touching.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.000
I can't feel anything.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.760
It's OK.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.760
Let's just go inside.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.160
Come on.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.000
I haven't been able to stop thinking
about the argument...after the race.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.240
I haven't been able to stop thinking
about the argument...after the race.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.480
Don't be an idiot.
Like I care about that now.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.680
She said it doesn't matter.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.000
Doesn't sound like Neve.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.920
Well, she actually said,
"Don't be an idiot."
Like she cares about that now.

05:51.960 --> 05:52.000
Can you not...

05:52.000 --> 05:53.760
Can you not...

05:54.480 --> 05:57.320
Just tell me exactly what she says.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.000
Yeah. Sorry.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.280
Do you remember...

06:05.520 --> 06:08.000
..when you were younger,
we'd go to the cafe together

06:08.000 --> 06:08.480
..when you were younger,
we'd go to the cafe together

06:08.520 --> 06:11.080
and we'd always have the same thing?

06:11.120 --> 06:15.400
Apple juice... A carton of juice...
..and salt and vinegar crisps.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.320
It was your way of getting me
out of the house when...

06:21.120 --> 06:23.960
..you had too much drink.
What's she saying?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.920
She said, um...
that's what you used to do

06:26.960 --> 06:29.280
to get her out of the house
when I was, um...

06:30.120 --> 06:32.000
..when I'd been drinking.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.680
I didn't realise you knew that.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.720
I was thinking about it because...

06:44.600 --> 06:47.280
..it was our thing for years...

06:48.160 --> 06:50.840
..even after we moved out, and...

06:52.880 --> 06:56.000
..at some point we stopped doing it,
and...and I don't know why.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.200
..at some point we stopped doing it,
and...and I don't know why.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.440
I guess you just grew up.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.000
I can't remember
the last time, and...

07:04.000 --> 07:05.480
I can't remember
the last time, and...

07:06.160 --> 07:08.120
..I think it's because
I didn't realise

07:08.160 --> 07:10.240
it was gonna be the last time

07:10.280 --> 07:12.000
so I didn't pay attention.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.040
so I didn't pay attention.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.040
I didn't... I didn't memorise it.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.400
Now it's gone.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.840
And now I'm scared, because...

07:26.680 --> 07:28.000
..cos the last time I held you,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.640
..cos the last time I held you,

07:29.680 --> 07:31.800
I didn't know then either...

07:31.840 --> 07:36.000
that I wouldn't get to do it again,
and I don't want to lose her,

07:36.000 --> 07:36.800
that I wouldn't get to do it again,
and I don't want to lose her,

07:36.840 --> 07:40.000
I don't want to lose
any of the last times.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.280
Hey, you haven't lost Neve.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.000
She's still here.
I just...

07:44.000 --> 07:46.040
She's still here.
I just...

07:46.760 --> 07:49.040
I just...

07:49.080 --> 07:52.000
I just wish I could see something.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.040
I just wish I could see something.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.920
Is she here?
Daniel?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.160
I tried calling.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.320
Has something happened?

08:14.960 --> 08:16.000
I spoke to the coroner's office.
Can we talk about this outside?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.400
I spoke to the coroner's office.
Can we talk about this outside?

08:18.440 --> 08:22.600
Why? Didn't you decide together?
What's going on? Decide what?

08:22.640 --> 08:24.000
It was our decision to make.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.360
It was our decision to make.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.560
But you can't just refuse
to accept her body.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.120
She has to be buried, Maria.
I know it's hard.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.000
We're not ready.
I've made an appointment
with the vicar.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.120
We're not ready.
I've made an appointment
with the vicar.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.600
What? I thought
maybe you could chat to him.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.000
I'll leave you two to it.
Cancel it!

08:40.000 --> 08:40.480
I'll leave you two to it.
Cancel it!

08:43.680 --> 08:45.800
Neve, wait. It's OK.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.960
Something's happening to me, Dad.
I'm changing.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.080
What do you mean?
I don't know.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.000
It's like...I've started
disappearing...bit by bit.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.640
It's like...I've started
disappearing...bit by bit.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.120
What will happen if you bury me?
We're not going to.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.840
Where am I gonna go?
We're gonna stop it.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.000
I've just started talking to Mum.
Maybe she will see me.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.280
I've just started talking to Mum.
Maybe she will see me.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.560
Hey, hey. I said we'll stop it.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.080
You're not going anywhere.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.880
How could you know that?

09:17.080 --> 09:20.000
I can't be here for any of this.
Neve.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.960
We'll decide.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.720
It's not just about you.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.400
Doesn't Neve deserve
a proper goodbye?

09:56.120 --> 09:58.160
Hey.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.000
You OK?

10:00.000 --> 10:00.160
You OK?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.840
Yep.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.080
Thought you might need to talk.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.800
Do you mind
if I stay here for a bit?

10:17.840 --> 10:20.200
Police are searching the house.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.000
They're up at the hotel, too.
Absolute joke.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.600
They're up at the hotel, too.
Absolute joke.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.000
They won't find anything.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.840
They won't find anything.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.440
I hope they do.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.480
You don't think he did it?

10:41.600 --> 10:45.680
For real? He's your fucking dad.
It's always someone's dad, isn't it?

10:45.720 --> 10:47.560
Or son.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.000
Brother.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.320
Brother.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.000
No-one ever thinks
it's gonna be theirs.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.560
You been in a fight?
No.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.720
You don't have to be like them,
you know?

11:07.760 --> 11:10.160
Who?
Grandad...

11:10.200 --> 11:12.000
Dad...

11:12.000 --> 11:12.680
Dad...

11:12.720 --> 11:14.320
..the guys at the club.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.640
The way you all turn
every feeling into anger

11:19.680 --> 11:20.000
cos you're too scared
to feel anything else.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.560
cos you're too scared
to feel anything else.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.440
That's not true.
Lashing out

11:23.480 --> 11:26.160
to prove that you're not weak.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.480
When are you gonna realise
it's the same thing?

11:32.880 --> 11:34.920
I don't want to be this angry.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.760
It just takes over sometimes.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.040
Especially since Neve.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.560
It's contagious.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.120
I swear, it spreads
through this place like disease.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.000
I'm sorry.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.640
I'm sorry.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.920
I know the crash wasn't your fault.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.000
I guess it was easier
to blame you than myself.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.360
I guess it was easier
to blame you than myself.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.880
I'll tell everyone the truth.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.720
What's the point?

12:20.520 --> 12:23.160
Have them hate you, too?

12:27.440 --> 12:29.640
I'm used to it now, anyway.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.040
Why'd you come back?

12:38.160 --> 12:40.000
Cos of my dad.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.320
Cos of my dad.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.360
He's controlled us our whole lives.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.000
'Well, that's all changed now.'

12:48.000 --> 12:49.400
'Well, that's all changed now.'

13:02.320 --> 13:04.000
Chris, come on.
You don't need to be in here.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.040
Chris, come on.
You don't need to be in here.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.360
Been trekking all over town
looking for you.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.000
Your dad's worried.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.160
Your dad's worried.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.040
Guess I'll text him
and be on my way, then.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.680
Sit down if you want.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.440
Is that what you want?

13:52.720 --> 13:54.720
I'll take that as a yes.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.320
Maybe you were right...

14:05.240 --> 14:07.600
..about facing what's happened.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.000
But the GHB's screwed up my memory.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.160
But the GHB's screwed up my memory.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.520
I don't think it's the drugs.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.440
I remember everything that night.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.000
Maybe you've blocked it out.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.440
Maybe you've blocked it out.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.080
It's my fault.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.000
I made the choice,
I put myself in that position.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.680
I made the choice,
I put myself in that position.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.640
If I hadn't taken that shit,
I could have fought back.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.000
I got myself killed.
Stop!

14:32.000 --> 14:32.960
I got myself killed.
Stop!

14:33.640 --> 14:36.520
This is exactly what
I didn't want you to do.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.000
I've fucked everyone's life up.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.680
I've fucked everyone's life up.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.600
Mum's never gonna get over this.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.000
Me still being here
is just making it worse. She's...

14:48.000 --> 14:48.160
Me still being here
is just making it worse. She's...

14:49.440 --> 14:51.280
She's trapped, too.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.560
You didn't do that to her.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.000
You didn't get a choice.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.200
You didn't get a choice.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.720
And you didn't fuck
anyone's life up.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.000
You saved mine.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.720
You saved mine.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.480
Mum's trying to stop them
releasing my body.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.000
I think she thinks if...
they bury me, I...

15:20.000 --> 15:21.040
I think she thinks if...
they bury me, I...

15:22.280 --> 15:24.880
..I might pass on, or something.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.000
Is that what you think, too?

15:28.000 --> 15:28.280
Is that what you think, too?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.160
You saw what happened to my hands.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.800
I'm already fading, so...

15:41.880 --> 15:44.000
Nope. Still here.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.480
Nope. Still here.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.800
Alex.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.360
Your body's been lying in a freezer.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.000
What difference will it make
if it's in the ground?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.680
What difference will it make
if it's in the ground?

15:54.760 --> 15:57.160
You're not gonna disappear.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.000
Maybe it's better if I do.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.800
Maybe it's better if I do.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.640
We've been granted an extension
to your custody time

16:14.680 --> 16:16.000
due to additional evidence.

16:16.000 --> 16:16.280
due to additional evidence.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.760
What evidence?

16:24.600 --> 16:27.480
These keys were found
inside your workshop...

16:28.360 --> 16:31.320
..and one of them matches
the lock on the boat shed.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.960
So?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.880
Did you take a boat from that shed,
the night of the party,

16:36.920 --> 16:38.600
to dispose of Neve's body?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.000
I've had these keys for years,
since Alex was a kid.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.560
I've had these keys for years,
since Alex was a kid.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.960
Plenty of people use the boat shed.
You haven't answered the question.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Well, the answer's no.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.920
Well, the answer's no.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.280
Is that all you've got?

16:59.160 --> 17:02.600
We've also found traces of blood
in Room 7 of Keaton Hall.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.000
Do you know anything about that?

17:04.000 --> 17:04.960
Do you know anything about that?

17:13.560 --> 17:15.640
No comment.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.720
Forensics are working
to extract DNA,

17:18.760 --> 17:20.000
which we'll compare with Neve's.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
which we'll compare with Neve's.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.640
It's in your interests to cooperate.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.000
Is it Neve's blood?

17:29.040 --> 17:30.640
No comment.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.880
William...

17:36.760 --> 17:40.960
William...did you murder Neve Kelly?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.000
No fucking comment.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.320
No fucking comment.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.320
Where's Mum?
Gone to church.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.000
Family meeting.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.120
Family meeting.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.600
I've gotta get down there,
but I just...

18:04.360 --> 18:06.760
My head's pounding non-stop.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.680
I never said it before, but...

18:13.920 --> 18:16.000
..I am proud of you for stopping.

18:16.000 --> 18:16.840
..I am proud of you for stopping.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.480
Don't get mushy.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.000
I... I don't know
who I am without it.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.040
I... I don't know
who I am without it.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.160
So things are a bit scary right now.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.040
But I know it's the right thing...
for you and for your mum.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.000
If I'd just stopped a long time ago,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.040
If I'd just stopped a long time ago,

18:42.080 --> 18:44.360
maybe things
would've been different.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.880
I've gotta go.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.160
I promise you, you don't need
to worry about this funeral.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.000
We're gonna shut this down.
Maybe you shouldn't.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.360
We're gonna shut this down.
Maybe you shouldn't.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.000
I don't know who I am either...
if I'm not here any more,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I don't know who I am either...
if I'm not here any more,

19:06.040 --> 19:09.360
but...that's no reason to fight it.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.760
I think I'm ready to find out.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.000
We're gonna be late.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.520
We're gonna be late.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.880
Why'd Max throw these away?

19:40.680 --> 19:44.000
Oh, camera's broken.
See the smudges?

19:44.000 --> 19:44.040
Oh, camera's broken.
See the smudges?

19:44.080 --> 19:45.680
Mm.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.360
Said he wanted to take it
to Maria to fix but, um...

19:48.400 --> 19:50.760
I said it wasn't a good idea
right now.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.000
I'll, uh, have a look later.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.480
I'll, uh, have a look later.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.960
You look smart.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.560
You know you don't have to come?

20:04.960 --> 20:07.120
No, I want to.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.320
For Neve.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.880
Hop in the car.
I'll only be a minute.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.000
I've got an appointment.
It won't be long.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.080
I've got an appointment.
It won't be long.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.280
Just a few questions.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.440
What, about William?
Uh...

20:30.480 --> 20:32.000
Actually, um,
it's about your ex-wife.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.160
Actually, um,
it's about your ex-wife.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.280
What does Victoria
have to do with Neve's case?

20:36.320 --> 20:39.600
I'm not sure yet.
Just following a line of enquiry.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.880
What did you think had happened,
when Victoria went missing?

20:44.920 --> 20:47.080
Things had got too much for her.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.000
I thought she walked out on us.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.680
I thought she walked out on us.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.840
But then she would have come back.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.000
For the kids.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.440
For the kids.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.400
She struggled...being a mum...

21:02.960 --> 21:04.000
..but she loved them both so much.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.280
..but she loved them both so much.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.880
So, what do you believe now?

21:15.560 --> 21:17.560
That she took her own life.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.000
That maybe she was in such a state,
there was some sort of accident.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.840
That maybe she was in such a state,
there was some sort of accident.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.000
How is this relevant to Neve?

21:28.000 --> 21:28.040
How is this relevant to Neve?

21:28.080 --> 21:31.120
Victoria was one of the architects
on Keaton Hall, is that right?

21:31.160 --> 21:33.320
Yeah, it was her last project.
Mm.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.000
And William obviously
ended up buying the property.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.720
And William obviously
ended up buying the property.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.240
Did the two of them
spend much time there alone?

21:39.280 --> 21:41.880
Do you think
he did something to her?

21:41.920 --> 21:44.000
We found evidence of blood
at the Hall.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.080
We found evidence of blood
at the Hall.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.640
Obviously, we were looking
to link it to Neve,

21:47.680 --> 21:49.360
but forensics have identified

21:49.400 --> 21:52.000
that it's around
seven or eight years old.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.160
that it's around
seven or eight years old.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.120
We haven't been able
to extract DNA yet.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.040
It takes longer
with a sample of that age.

21:56.080 --> 21:59.520
It's entirely possible that it's
totally unconnected to Victoria.

21:59.560 --> 22:00.000
But you think it's her?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.480
But you think it's her?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.800
What did she say?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.000
Nothing important, love.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.360
Nothing important, love.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.080
I don't believe you.

22:23.920 --> 22:24.000
Why would she want that?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.720
Why would she want that?

22:25.760 --> 22:28.680
She just feels like
it might be better for everyone.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.600
Not for me.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.000
If she's still here,
why would I risk losing her?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.320
If she's still here,
why would I risk losing her?

22:33.360 --> 22:35.440
Just hear what they have to say.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.280
Give them a chance.

22:49.680 --> 22:53.360
I've spoken to the vicar.
He knows we don't want to go ahead.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.000
So, we don't even get a say?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.440
So, we don't even get a say?

22:59.160 --> 23:03.440
This was supposed to be a meeting,
an actual conversation, Maria.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.080
The coroner can't keep the body.
Just for a bit longer.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.480
For what?!
I'm not ready.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.160
So fuck the rest of us?!
Katie.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.000
No.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.400
No.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.840
I'm sick of her being so selfish.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.520
You know Max is barely
getting out of bed now?

23:19.560 --> 23:20.000
No. Cos you didn't bother to ask.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.200
No. Cos you didn't bother to ask.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.760
He needs to be able to say goodbye.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.000
You're not just holding
Neve hostage, it's all of us.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.640
You're not just holding
Neve hostage, it's all of us.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.640
I don't know why I'm surprised.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.960
You couldn't even let her go
when she was alive.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.080
OK, that's enough.
No.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.240
Maria.
I need time on my own.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.640
Did they find anything?

24:20.440 --> 24:23.080
They wouldn't let me know
if they had.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.000
Leave that. I'll do it.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.840
Leave that. I'll do it.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.360
I said I'll do it.
I want to help.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.440
I don't want you
to have to lift a finger. Ever.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.560
I'm sorry I let you down.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.160
It's OK.
No...

24:56.360 --> 24:58.200
..it's not OK.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.200
I should've seen it.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.840
What he was like.

25:04.560 --> 25:08.000
I should have seen it...
and I should have protected you.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.280
Ever get sick of pretending?

25:52.560 --> 25:54.880
The way people are around here.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.880
We just go along with it.

25:59.960 --> 26:00.000
Like sheep.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.800
Like sheep.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.440
Like how I did with Tom.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.840
I saw the look on your face.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.480
I knew what you thought of me.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.000
I don't want to be that person.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.120
I don't want to be that person.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.320
The night she died...

26:23.080 --> 26:24.000
..Neve said to me
that she didn't want to be stuck

26:24.000 --> 26:25.840
..Neve said to me
that she didn't want to be stuck

26:25.880 --> 26:28.880
in the same place
with the same people for ever.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.000
She wanted to get out,
see the world.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.160
She wanted to get out,
see the world.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.760
Figure stuff out.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.040
I think I might need that too.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.040
Where would you go?

26:46.720 --> 26:48.000
I don't know. Anywhere.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.760
I don't know. Anywhere.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.880
Wh... When?

26:53.320 --> 26:55.320
There's no point delaying it.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.960
What about me?

27:01.720 --> 27:03.280
We're not fucking married.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.480
Come with me.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.560
Nah, nah.
You'd do my fucking head in.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.840
How'd you know it's gonna be
better somewhere else, hm?

27:27.200 --> 27:28.000
I don't.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
I don't.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.360
But at least I'd be trying.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.760
You're really serious?

27:36.920 --> 27:38.760
Yeah.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.000
I'll miss you.

27:44.000 --> 27:44.320
I'll miss you.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.480
Yeah, I'll miss you, too, mate.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.160
I don't know if you're here.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.000
I am.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.880
I am.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.640
I'm right beside you.
I'm not sure I want you to be.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.520
I'm scared that you're trapped.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.680
Like you were when you were alive.
Because...

29:42.160 --> 29:44.000
Because I'm still not strong enough
to let you go.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.360
Because I'm still not strong enough
to let you go.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.840
It's OK, Mum.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.000
Neve?

30:08.000 --> 30:08.400
Neve?

30:12.080 --> 30:14.080
Are you there?

30:20.880 --> 30:22.440
Blow it out.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.960
I need you to tell me what you want.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
And I...
I promise to listen his time.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.600
And I...
I promise to listen his time.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.440
I just want you to live your life.
Do you want to say goodbye?

30:47.800 --> 30:48.000
Blow it out again if you do.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.320
Blow it out again if you do.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.320
You don't have to hold on any more,
sweetheart.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.560
You can be free.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.400
Nothing's gonna happen.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.520
You can't go anywhere
if I don't let go.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.760
You know, I think...I still needed
to work some things out.

31:59.960 --> 32:00.000
That's why I was trapped here.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.360
That's why I was trapped here.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.800
But it's done now.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.000
You deserve to be free as well.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.080
You deserve to be free as well.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.600
You did your time.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.680
I'm free when I'm with you.

32:23.840 --> 32:24.000
Just...whatever happens...

32:24.000 --> 32:27.120
Just...whatever happens...

32:30.120 --> 32:32.000
..promise me you're...
you're going to live.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.240
..promise me you're...
you're going to live.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.800
Really live.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.520
You know, get out of this place.
Do something amazing.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.000
OK. I'm gonna put a stop
on goodbye speeches

32:40.000 --> 32:43.480
OK. I'm gonna put a stop
on goodbye speeches

32:43.520 --> 32:45.840
because you're not going anywhere.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.000
And I will continue to live
an entirely mediocre life

32:48.000 --> 32:50.480
And I will continue to live
an entirely mediocre life

32:50.520 --> 32:52.840
and I will live it with you.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.000
See? You're still here.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.200
See? You're still here.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.000
Joe?

35:12.000 --> 35:12.200
Joe?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.920
I'm gonna head down to the station.

35:14.960 --> 35:18.480
If they don't charge him today,
they'll have to release him.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.000
Where you going?

35:20.000 --> 35:20.480
Where you going?

35:26.640 --> 35:28.000
I'm leaving, Dad.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.560
I'm leaving, Dad.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.080
Don't be daft.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.400
I'm being serious.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.000
I can't be here any more.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.560
I can't be here any more.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.800
Why?

35:39.840 --> 35:41.760
It's not what it was.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.000
Not since Neve.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.080
Not since Neve.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.320
Is this about Tom?

35:46.360 --> 35:48.680
I know you feel bad,
but grief does funny things.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.840
You're still a good lad.
There's no such thing round here.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.000
Especially not in this family.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.480
Especially not in this family.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.360
What's that supposed to mean?

35:57.160 --> 35:59.000
Hey.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.000
Your uncle never touched Neve.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.600
Your uncle never touched Neve.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.800
How can you defend him,
the way he treats you?

36:04.840 --> 36:06.520
Look what he's done for us.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.000
He bought the Hall
so we could do it up,

36:08.000 --> 36:08.440
He bought the Hall
so we could do it up,

36:08.480 --> 36:10.160
so we could work on it as a family.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.160
He uses you for labour
and barks orders.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.240
That... That is not his fault.
That's how we were brought up.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.000
By Grandad who was kicking
the shit out of the pair of you.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.920
By Grandad who was kicking
the shit out of the pair of you.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.560
Where is all this coming from?
Can't you see it?

36:22.480 --> 36:24.000
It's history repeating itself.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.680
It's history repeating itself.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.200
I'm sorry, but it's true.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I don't want to turn out like that.

36:32.000 --> 36:32.640
I don't want to turn out like that.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.080
So you're just gonna leave me
on my own?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.000
You can visit me, whenever you want.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.720
You can visit me, whenever you want.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.920
It's not like
I'm never gonna see you again.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.080
But I have to do this
and I need you to understand.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.000
Wouldn't have been able
to do this a few days ago.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.240
Wouldn't have been able
to do this a few days ago.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.520
My hands would've been
all over the shop.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.480
It really is different this time.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.760
What happened to Neve...

37:24.800 --> 37:27.160
I'm sorry that's what it took,
but...

37:28.200 --> 37:30.920
..I'm not wasting
any more of my life.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.760
Good.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.240
Don't go back to Daniel.
Tom.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.600
I know I don't deserve you.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.000
But I never did...
and you still loved me anyway.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.280
But I never did...
and you still loved me anyway.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.880
It's still there, isn't it?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.000
I'll always love you.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
I'll always love you.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.560
We can't undo what happened.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.680
We're not those people any more.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.720
I don't want to be those people.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.880
I want to be better.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.000
And I...I can be better -
WILL be better - for you.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.160
And I...I can be better -
WILL be better - for you.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.000
I'm sorry.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.960
I'm sorry.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.000
It's the police station.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.400
It's the police station.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.240
How could you just let him go?!

39:14.280 --> 39:17.280
The CPS didn't feel there was
a strong enough case to charge.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.000
I'm sorry.
The investigation is still ongoing.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.120
I'm sorry.
The investigation is still ongoing.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.000
And in the meantime,
he's just out there?

39:22.040 --> 39:23.560
Free to hurt someone else?

39:23.600 --> 39:25.480
I saw him at the party with Neve.
I told you.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.000
No-one else would corroborate that.
Even if they did, it's not enough.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.640
No-one else would corroborate that.
Even if they did, it's not enough.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.320
So, when you searched his house,
you didn't find anything?

39:31.360 --> 39:33.480
And at the hotel?
What about forensics?

39:33.520 --> 39:35.680
What about the belt?!
What belt?

39:40.640 --> 39:43.440
We've never released
any information about a belt.

39:48.480 --> 39:52.000
They let me go. Right?
What more proof do you need?

39:52.000 --> 39:52.520
They let me go. Right?
What more proof do you need?

39:52.560 --> 39:55.200
That just proves they don't have
enough evidence to charge you yet.

39:55.240 --> 39:58.560
Oh, come on.
You made our daughter tell a lie

39:58.600 --> 40:00.000
that put her in
a juvenile detention centre.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.280
that put her in
a juvenile detention centre.

40:01.320 --> 40:04.920
Our daughter!
Christine, she killed someone.

40:08.280 --> 40:14.440
Oh! It's like I'm getting
my sight back after 20 years.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.000
You're a fucking disgrace!

40:16.000 --> 40:17.520
You're a fucking disgrace!

40:17.560 --> 40:20.320
Please, Chris. Chris -
Did you kill Neve?!

40:25.920 --> 40:28.240
No.
You're a liar...

40:29.600 --> 40:32.000
..and I want you out of this house.

40:32.000 --> 40:32.120
..and I want you out of this house.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.720
I'm packing you a bag.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.520
Dad.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.560
Police had to let me go.
Lack of evidence.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.000
You were wrong.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.040
You were wrong.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.000
If the police will never give me
justice, I have to get it myself.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.600
If the police will never give me
justice, I have to get it myself.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.640
What does that mean?
I don't know.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.280
That sound.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.280
OK, I'm listening.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.000
I'm right here.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.640
I'm right here.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.400
Come on.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.000
Come on!

42:00.000 --> 42:00.800
Come on!

42:07.360 --> 42:08.000
Neve!

42:08.000 --> 42:09.160
Neve!

42:24.920 --> 42:26.920
I'm here.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.000
Neve!

42:32.000 --> 42:32.160
Neve!

42:38.000 --> 42:39.640
Show me.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.240
Bye, Neve.
