HIS WIFE A PICTURE OF ME,

05:51.268 --> 05:53.270
AND SHE THINKS I LOOK LIKE

05:51.268 --> 05:53.270
ELIZABETH TAYLOR,

05:53.312 --> 05:56.064
WHICH MAKES HER DEBBIE REYNOLDS

05:53.312 --> 05:56.064
AND STANLEY, EDDIE FISHER.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.566
THAT'S CRAZY.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.566
ESPECIALLY

05:56.106 --> 05:58.566
IF YOU'VE<i> SEEN</i> STANLEY.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.360
HE IS NO EDDIE FISHER.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.360
FISHER STEVENS, MAYBE.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.780
CAN'T YOU TALK TO HER?

06:01.402 --> 06:03.780
AT MY OWN RISK.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.533
AT LEAST SHE THOUGHT YOU LOOKED

06:03.822 --> 06:06.533
LIKE ELIZABETH TAYLOR.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.409
I'VE NO PARTNER.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.409
YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER ONE.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.870
ELIZABETH TAYLOR

06:08.451 --> 06:09.870
ALWAYS DID.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.454
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE

06:09.911 --> 06:11.454
OUT THERE.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.291
I GUESS.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.291
HERE. HAVE SOME MORE CHICKEN.

06:14.333 --> 06:18.128
THANKS, MOM.

06:14.333 --> 06:18.128
AND IF YOU'D LIKE, LATER ON,

06:14.333 --> 06:18.128
YOU CAN MAKE MY ASPARAGUS TALK.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.047
OH, MAYBE NEXT WEEK.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.757
OKAY, SO, LET'S TALK

06:20.088 --> 06:22.757
ABOUT SATURDAY.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.757
WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.301
THE 75th-ANNIVERSARY ISSUE

06:22.799 --> 06:24.301
OF THE<i> FRANKLIN</i>

06:24.343 --> 06:27.095
COMES OUT NEXT MONTH,

06:24.343 --> 06:27.095
AND I WANT IT TO BE AMAZING.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.890
I'VE GOT GREAT

06:27.137 --> 06:29.890
COVER ART LINED UP.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.890
OLD PICTURES, NEW PICTURES?

06:29.931 --> 06:33.060
COLLAGE STYLE WITH KIND OF

06:29.931 --> 06:33.060
A SEPIA-TONE FINISH TO IT.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.644
OKAY. I LIKE IT.

06:34.686 --> 06:35.854
TIME!

06:35.896 --> 06:38.148
SEE YA.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.148
BYE.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.025
SO WHAT

06:38.190 --> 06:40.025
WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.569
WORKING SATURDAY

06:40.067 --> 06:42.569
ON THE 75th-ANNIVERSARY ISSUE.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.906
THANKS FOR ASKING!

06:42.610 --> 06:45.906
BUT YOU GUYS ALREADY HAVE SOME

06:42.610 --> 06:45.906
DECENT STUFF PLANNED, RIGHT?

06:45.947 --> 06:48.242
MADELINE --

06:45.947 --> 06:48.242
OR MAY I CALL YOU "SPICOLI"?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.911
IF YOU HAVE TO.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.911
THIS IS THE 75th-ANNIVERSARY

06:48.283 --> 06:50.911
ISSUE.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.081
THERE IS ONLY GOING TO BE<i> ONE</i>

06:50.952 --> 06:54.081
75th-ANNIVERSARY ISSUE EVER.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.167
WE SCREW THIS UP,

06:54.122 --> 06:57.167
AND WE'VE BASICALLY MOONED

06:54.122 --> 06:57.167
A PIECE OF HISTORY.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.460
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT --

06:57.209 --> 06:59.460
TO B.A. HISTORY?

06:59.502 --> 07:02.964
LAST YEAR WAS THE

06:59.502 --> 07:02.964
74th-ANNIVERSARY ISSUE

06:59.502 --> 07:02.964
OF THE<i> FRANKLIN.</i>

07:03.006 --> 07:06.301
SO?

07:03.006 --> 07:06.301
THERE'S ONLY GONNA BE ONE

07:03.006 --> 07:06.301
74th-ANNIVERSARY ISSUE<i> EVER.</i>

07:06.343 --> 07:08.345
AND WE DIDN'T DO

07:06.343 --> 07:08.345
ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR<i> IT.</i>

07:08.387 --> 07:10.513
THE COVER WAS

07:08.387 --> 07:10.513
OF A DEEP-FRIED MARS BAR.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.516
NOBODY CARES ABOUT

07:10.555 --> 07:13.516
THE 74th-ANNIVERSARY ISSUE.

07:13.558 --> 07:17.478
I'LL BET THE PERSON WHO WORKED

07:13.558 --> 07:17.478
ON IT 74 YEARS AGO DID.

07:13.558 --> 07:17.478
WE'RE WORKING SATURDAY!

07:18.646 --> 07:19.940
"WHY ARE WE WORKING SATURDAY?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.775
"WHAT'S SO SPECIAL

07:19.981 --> 07:21.775
ABOUT THE 75th ISSUE?

07:21.816 --> 07:25.695
WHY DOES MY HEAD FEEL SO LIGHT

07:21.816 --> 07:25.695
AND YET NOT FLOAT AWAY, PARIS?"

07:25.737 --> 07:27.697
WHAT?

07:25.737 --> 07:27.697
WHAT'S<i> HE</i> DOING HERE?

07:27.739 --> 07:29.616
I BET HE'S HERE

07:27.739 --> 07:29.616
TO SEE<i> YOU.</i>

07:29.657 --> 07:31.410
I HAVEN'T SEEN

07:29.657 --> 07:31.410
OR HEARD FROM HIM

07:31.451 --> 07:33.328
SINCE OUR DATE THREE MONTHS AGO.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.915
MAYBE HE WANTS TO EXPLAIN WHY.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.915
HE WAS TO GO AWAY,

07:33.370 --> 07:36.915
NEVER COME BACK.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.209
I ALREADY WROTE HIS NAME

07:36.957 --> 07:39.209
IN MY REVENGE NOTEBOOK.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.752
HE KNOWS YOU'RE TALKING

07:39.251 --> 07:40.752
ABOUT HIM.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.546
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

07:40.794 --> 07:43.546
GO OVER THERE AND FIND OUT.

07:46.758 --> 07:50.553
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

07:46.758 --> 07:50.553
I'M ON BREAK FROM SCHOOL.

07:46.758 --> 07:50.553
I THOUGHT I'D COME SEE YOU.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.056
BUT...YOU NEVER CALLED.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.056
I KNOW.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.558
YOU...LOST MY NUMBER?

07:53.098 --> 07:55.558
NOPE -- I MEMORIZED

07:53.098 --> 07:55.558
YOUR NUMBER.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.852
YOU DIDN'T WANNA USE IT?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.852
I WAS STARTING CLASSES.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.396
IN PHONE DIALING?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.396
HOW'S IT GOING?

07:59.438 --> 08:01.273
PARIS, THIS YEAR'S

07:59.438 --> 08:01.273
VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.317
THE LAST THING

08:01.315 --> 08:03.317
I NEEDED WAS A DISTRACTION.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.820
WELL, I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.820
THIS YEAR IS VERY IMPORTANT

08:03.358 --> 08:06.820
FOR ME, TOO.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.363
I'M FOCUSING

08:06.861 --> 08:08.363
ON GETTING INTO HARVARD,

08:08.405 --> 08:10.657
AND THE LAST THING<i> I</i> NEED

08:08.405 --> 08:10.657
IS A DISTRACTION.

08:10.698 --> 08:14.453
SO...GOOD MOVE. YOU SAVED US

08:10.698 --> 08:14.453
BOTH A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.580
THANK YOU...

08:14.494 --> 08:17.580
AND GOOD LUCK.

08:17.622 --> 08:21.168
I NEED MY HAND.

08:17.622 --> 08:21.168
IF I LET GO,

08:17.622 --> 08:21.168
HOW FAST WILL YOU RUN AWAY?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.920
3.2 SECONDS.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.920
I THOUGHT SO.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.920
HEY, RORY.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.048
HEY, JAMIE.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.048
HOW'S PRINCETON?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.425
GOOD. CRAZY, BUT --

08:27.090 --> 08:28.425
LET GO.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.426
NO.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.426
YES.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.593
PARIS...

08:30.635 --> 08:32.804
LOOK,

08:30.635 --> 08:32.804
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.891
I GET IT -- I'M A DISTRACTION.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.891
PULL A "BOXING HELENA"

08:32.846 --> 08:36.891
OR GIVE ME BACK MY HAND.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.935
YES, TALKING TO YOU

08:36.933 --> 08:38.935
WOULD'VE BEEN A DISTRACTION.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.230
I KNOW. I HEARD YOU ALREADY.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.230
FIND A PIRATE TO SIT ON.

08:42.272 --> 08:46.067
HOWEVER,<i> NOT</i> TALKING TO YOU HAS

08:42.272 --> 08:46.067
TURNED OUT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

08:42.272 --> 08:46.067
WHAT?

08:46.109 --> 08:49.904
I FLUNKED A POP QUIZ IN POLI SCI

08:46.109 --> 08:49.904
BECAUSE I COULDN'T STOP

08:46.109 --> 08:49.904
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.866
YOU STILL WANT

08:49.946 --> 08:52.866
YOUR HAND BACK?

08:49.946 --> 08:52.866
I'VE GOT ANOTHER.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.909
I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS,

08:52.907 --> 08:54.909
AND APPARENTLY,

08:54.951 --> 08:56.953
YOU'RE A DISTRACTION

08:54.951 --> 08:56.953
THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

08:56.995 --> 09:00.040
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BAD TIME

08:56.995 --> 09:00.040
ON THE DATE?

08:56.995 --> 09:00.040
ARE YOU BUSY?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.958
WELL --

09:00.081 --> 09:01.958
NO. WE'RE DONE.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.958
SHE'S FREE.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.128
GOOD.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.128
LET'S GO GET SOME COFFEE.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.464
BYE, RORY.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.464
BYE, JAMIE.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.717
HE TOOK MY BOOKS.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.717
WELL, GO GET THEM BACK.

09:15.180 --> 09:19.059
WELL?

09:15.180 --> 09:19.059
STILL RINGING.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.727
HE'S HOME.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.727
HOW'D HE SOUND?

09:20.768 --> 09:21.895
HOMEY.

09:20.768 --> 09:21.895
NICE.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.688
I KNOW THIS IS

09:21.936 --> 09:23.688
A STUPID QUESTION,

09:23.730 --> 09:25.732
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU JUST

09:23.730 --> 09:25.732
TALK TO HIM?

09:25.773 --> 09:27.526
BECAUSE YESTERDAY

09:25.773 --> 09:27.526
HE CALLED TO SAY

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
THEY WERE STILL LOOKING

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
FOR A REHEARSAL SPACE

09:29.610 --> 09:31.863
AND THAT HE'D CALL

09:29.610 --> 09:31.863
WHEN HE HAD MORE NEWS,

09:31.905 --> 09:34.157
SO NOW I HAVE TO WAIT

09:31.905 --> 09:34.157
UNTIL HE CALLS.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.701
IN BETWEEN, I CALL

09:34.199 --> 09:36.701
AND HANG UP ON HIM -- PATHETIC.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.246
NOT SO PATHETIC.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.246
I USED TO HANG UP ON DEAN.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.914
YOU DID?

09:39.287 --> 09:40.914
I REMEMBER THAT.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.708
WHEN DID YOU HANG UP ON ME?

09:40.955 --> 09:43.708
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.502
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.502
I COULDN'T.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.213
THEN YOU WOULD'VE KNOWN THAT

09:45.544 --> 09:48.213
I LIKED YOU.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.507
BUT I LIKED YOU, TOO.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.507
I KNOW THAT<i> NOW.</i>

09:50.549 --> 09:53.593
YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN THAT<i> THEN. </i>

09:50.549 --> 09:53.593
DEAN, THIS IS A GIRL THING.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.887
TELL ME WHEN I'M SUPPOSED TO

09:53.634 --> 09:55.887
PAY ATTENTION AGAIN.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.265
I'LL LOVE HIM FOREVER,

09:55.929 --> 09:58.265
AND HE'LL NEVER KNOW IT.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.640
HE WOULD IF YOU COUGHED.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.640
DEAN!

09:59.682 --> 10:01.684
AT LEAST HE'S AT HOME

09:59.682 --> 10:01.684
AND NOT OUT WITH A GIRL.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.977
VERY TRUE.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.188
HE COULD BE<i> HOME</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:05.188
WITH A GIRL...

10:03.019 --> 10:05.188
DEAN!

10:05.230 --> 10:06.773
SITING HERE,

10:05.230 --> 10:06.773
STARING AT MY PIZZA.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.317
YOU THINK HE'S HOME WITH A GIRL?

10:06.814 --> 10:09.317
<i>I</i> DON'T.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.404
I'M GONNA CALL AGAIN.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.404
PAY ATTENTION TO

10:09.359 --> 10:12.404
THE BACKGROUND NOISE THIS TIME.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.947
OH, COOL -- PIZZA.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.741
SHE'S CALLING DAVE TO SEE

10:13.988 --> 10:16.741
IF SHE CAN HEAR A GIRL.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.535
I VOTED THAT

10:16.783 --> 10:18.535
SHE ACTUALLY SAY SOMETHING.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.620
YOU'RE A BOY.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.620
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.663
WHAT'D YOU HEAR?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.663
"QUADROPHENIA."

10:22.705 --> 10:25.333
CLASSY, BUT NOT DATE-LIKE.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.333
YOU THINK?

10:25.375 --> 10:28.420
WHAT IF HE MET A GIRL

10:25.375 --> 10:28.420
WHO'S A MAJOR WHO FAN?

10:25.375 --> 10:28.420
WHAT?

10:28.462 --> 10:30.297
WHY ARE YOU

10:28.462 --> 10:30.297
CAUSING TROUBLE?

10:30.338 --> 10:33.967
CAN I TALK TO YOU

10:30.338 --> 10:33.967
IN THE KITCHEN?

10:30.338 --> 10:33.967
OH, SURE. BE GOOD!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.766
GO AHEAD.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.272
OKAY, SO,

10:44.894 --> 10:47.272
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.357
[ GIGGLES ]

10:47.314 --> 10:49.357
I THINK I FIGURED OUT

10:49.399 --> 10:51.651
WHO CAN BE MY DANCE PARTNER

10:49.399 --> 10:51.651
FOR THE MARATHON.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.278
GREAT! WHO?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.155
BYE.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.155
COME ON!

10:55.196 --> 10:58.116
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.116
FIRST OF ALL -- YOU LOVE ME.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.453
NOT RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.453
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

10:58.158 --> 11:01.453
THIS MEANS TO ME.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.497
YOU'D NEVER FALL ASLEEP

11:01.495 --> 11:03.497
OR CHASE A PIE.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.291
I DO NOT DANCE.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.291
IT'LL BE FUN.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.291
WE'LL GET DRESSED UP.

I CANNOT DANCE WITH YOU.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.964
WHY NOT?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.342
BECAUSE THIS IS

DEAN'S FIRST MARATHON.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.512
WE WERE GONNA WATCH AND HANG

11:18.553 --> 11:21.722
I TOLD HIM HOW ANDREW

11:18.553 --> 11:21.722
GETS IN A FIGHT WITH HIS DATE

11:21.764 --> 11:23.266
AND STORMS OFF THE FLOOR.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.230
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A MAGICIAN.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.525

HE LIKES TO TAKE HIS VICTORY LAP

HE CAN STILL COME

11:37.905 --> 11:40.241
AND SEE ALL THOSE THINGS,

11:40.283 --> 11:42.285
EXCEPT IF<i> YOU</i> DANCE,

MAYBE THAT VICTORY LAP

11:42.327 --> 11:44.454

15:31.806 --> 15:33.892

HAVE THESE KIDS WITH?

15:39.230 --> 15:41.816

THE PROBLEM COMES IN.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.779
WHAT?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.779
I THINK I SAID "YES."

15:45.820 --> 15:47.154
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!

15:47.196 --> 15:48.948
I WAS SHOCKED

15:47.196 --> 15:48.948
WHEN HE ANNOUNCED IT,

15:48.989 --> 15:51.701
SO I KIND OF SAID,

15:48.989 --> 15:51.701
"O...KAY?"

15:51.743 --> 15:53.953
BUT I THINK HE TOOK IT

15:51.743 --> 15:53.953
AS "OKAY!"

15:53.994 --> 15:55.996
SO, APPARENTLY,

15:53.994 --> 15:55.996
NOW I HAVE TO GET BUSY.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.625
DO<i> YOU</i> WANT

15:56.038 --> 15:58.625

15:56.038 --> 15:58.625
NO.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.168
I MEAN, I WANT KIDS.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.168
YOU KNOW I WANT KIDS.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.630
I KNOW YOU WANT KIDS.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.630
I THOUGHT MAYBE<i> ONE --</i>

16:03.671 --> 16:06.507
TWO IF THE FIRST ONE

16:03.671 --> 16:06.507
IS<i> REALLY</i> QUIET.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.342
WELL, YOU HAVE

16:06.549 --> 16:08.342
TO TELL JACKSON THAT.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.345
I CAN'T.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.345
THIS ISN'T LIKE THE BOWL

16:08.384 --> 16:11.345
HIS MOTHER GAVE.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.848
YOU CAN'T STICK KIDS

16:11.387 --> 16:13.848
IN THE ATTIC AND PULL
