WEBVTT

00:10.928 --> 00:12.429
Bought something to toast with.

00:12.512 --> 00:15.307
Figured we should celebrate
21st-century style.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.601
The 21st century
doesn't even know we saved them.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.562
Well, there'd be a lot of this
if they did.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.021
You know, a lot of people died.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.230
- We should--
- Because of them,

00:22.314 --> 00:23.941
a hell of a lot more people
are gonna live.

00:24.608 --> 00:28.654
91,462,000 more.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.906
It worked.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.742
In 18 months, Helios is gonna miss.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.452
Isn't that worth taking a moment?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.037
Yeah.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.872
Yeah, sure. I just...

00:40.332 --> 00:43.251
I never thought past the mission,
you know?

00:44.211 --> 00:47.631
I mean, the authorities can call it
a chemical explosion all they want,

00:47.715 --> 00:49.717
but the Russians, the Chinese,
they've got satellites.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.177
They're gonna know
it was an antimatter detonation.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.055
This could end up
in the same arms race

00:55.138 --> 00:56.348
that we came here to prevent in the--

00:56.431 --> 00:59.101
Boss... take the win.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.312
All right.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.108
Is anybody else's arm killing them?

01:06.191 --> 01:09.987
I told you the inoculation
might have some side effects.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.655
How about a toast?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.910
Well, I'm not big on speeches, so, um...

01:18.203 --> 01:20.163
May you all live long lives.

01:20.956 --> 01:21.957
Cheers.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.920
<i>Prost, salute, viva,</i>
<i>bud'mo, sk√•l. Le'Chaim!</i>

01:29.757 --> 01:30.799
Oh, God.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.635
Oh, that's just wrong.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.804
Ugh. I'm sorry, guys.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.515
I only had $20 on me.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.017
I really...

01:40.100 --> 01:43.771
And when you say,
"May you all live long lives,"

01:43.854 --> 01:45.939
that kinda sounds like
there won't be any more missions.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.986
Well, we may have done
what we came here to do...

01:51.069 --> 01:53.989
created a future
where we're no longer needed.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.452
All we have to do is...
live out our lives.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.539
These lives, I mean.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.166
Protocol 5.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.168
Indefinitely.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.670
Afternoon.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.463
Come with me.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.760
What's up?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.515
This has always been solid, right?
Between me and you?

04:25.598 --> 04:28.476
-Are you breaking up with me?
-No, I'm serious, man, I'm in trouble.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.686
What kind of trouble?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.729
-What you got on this afternoon?
-More of that.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.648
Not anymore. I need your help.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.900
Tell me what's going on.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.944
Look, you've been dropping off the grid
left and right lately,

04:37.027 --> 04:39.404
and I haven't asked one single question.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.614
Now, you're my partner, right?
And I trust you.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.575
Do you trust me?

04:43.658 --> 04:45.410
Of course I do.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.329
All right, let's go.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.443
It's okay.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.488
It's okay.
I know. I know.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.824
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.203
I'm not gonna stand it.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.915
I really don't know
how you stand this either.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.124
It's okay.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.463
None of this fits.
I think I'm getting fat.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.507
I don't think you understand
the meaning of the word.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.886
Well, either I'm getting fat,
or my boobs got bigger.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.347
Can you come in here a sec?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.890
Actually, no,
I don't think that's a good idea.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.767
-Don't think I'm supposed to--
-Come in here.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.894
-I need your help.
-Rene, the lady's right there,

08:39.977 --> 08:42.314
and she could... Okay.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.275
Look at all this stuff.
I got so much good shit.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.443
Yeah.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.486
-Look at this. Open back.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.904
And these pants.
Aren't they perfect?

08:49.987 --> 08:52.240
Yeah, they're really pants.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.326
-'Kay, open your coat. We gotta go.
-What?

08:54.409 --> 08:56.703
Open your coat!
I can't fit this all in my purse.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.247
You don't actually, uh,
want to steal all this stuff?

08:59.331 --> 09:01.124
Well, not all of it.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.294
Rene, don't.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.754
Come on!
You love this stuff!

09:06.838 --> 09:07.839
Help me.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.507
Do you have these in a size 13?

09:09.591 --> 09:12.510
It's so hard for me to find good shoes,
so... I really like these kicks.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.306
Do you think you could
maybe take a look,

09:16.389 --> 09:17.724
like, in the back?

09:17.807 --> 09:20.268
In the back? Sure.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.940
I thought this stuff got you hot.
Come on.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.442
-It gets me hot.
-Come on, look, Rene,

09:27.525 --> 09:29.944
I'm gonna have to admit
a bit of confusion at this point, okay?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.405
- I didn't think that--
- Hey, that's illegal!

09:32.489 --> 09:34.074
So's that.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.533
- Hey!
- Hey, wait!

09:35.617 --> 09:36.701
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:36.784 --> 09:38.411
The director's gonna
make you pay for this.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.372
Excuse me?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.082
You're paying for what they stole.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.430
Oh, shit.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.976
Hey, Phil. Phil?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.109
Hey, Phil.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.736
Come on, man.
Don't make me chase you.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.945
What's up?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.073
I thought you were off
of that shit.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.952
What am I, getting you the Percs
just for show?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.373
What do you want, Ray?

10:24.374 --> 10:25.667
Why don't you let me take you home?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.835
-Come on, man.
-I'm going for a walk.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.087
Yeah. I can see that.

10:30.172 --> 10:32.424
-Don't have any bets for you today.
-Forget about the bet.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.220
-You're scaring the children.
-Boo.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.013
Sorry. Sorry.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.971
Come on, let's go.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.764
Walt, what are we doing?

11:23.182 --> 11:24.642
-What is this?
-Just keep it reined in.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.894
These guys don't mess around.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.692
Stop where you are!
Eyes front!

11:32.775 --> 11:36.446
Put the bag down! Weapons down!
Put 'em on the ground!

11:36.529 --> 11:38.323
- Okay, we're doing it!
- Seriously?

11:38.406 --> 11:40.283
It's gonna be all right.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.455
Get your hands in the air.
Above your head!

11:45.538 --> 11:46.789
Eyes front!

11:49.417 --> 11:50.418
Sorry about that, Mac.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.464
Let's go.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.940
Surprise!

12:13.024 --> 12:15.527
Easy there, bud.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.236
You son of a bitch.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.655
You've got some new moves, Mac.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.072
Jesus, man,
I could've broken something.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.658
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.993
You still got no chill, man.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.830
Congratulations, partner.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.707
Oh, and thanks for the assist
with the propane.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.752
Come on, man.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.424
Fifteen years
and they can still surprise you?

12:37.507 --> 12:40.009
Congratulations.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.560
I swore to myself
I would never eat this shit again.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.438
Well,
the body needs fuel, man.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.064
When was the last time
you had a proper meal?

12:53.147 --> 12:56.859
All I ever see you eat
is Coke and Twinkies.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.487
When did you start caring
about my health?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.197
You see,
that's your problem, right there.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.660
Probably all you ever had
is junkies for friends, right?

13:05.743 --> 13:09.331
You never had anyone just lookin' out
for you 'cause they care.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.791
You only care because I give you bets.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.460
Yeah, your special abilities,

13:13.543 --> 13:18.340
they play a fundamental part
in our relationship, that's for sure.

13:18.423 --> 13:22.009
But I'm buying you lunch
'cause I'm a goddamn humanitarian.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.388
Hey, Marce?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.598
In here.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.683
Hey, I couldn't remember
if you liked the green apples

13:28.766 --> 13:31.603
or the red apples, so I just...
Jesus Christ.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.563
What?

13:35.357 --> 13:37.066
What the hell are you doing?

13:37.149 --> 13:39.402
Uh, just a minor surgery.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.488
Nothing serious.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.615
What have you done to yourself?

13:44.407 --> 13:49.912
I've installed a vagus nerve stimulator...
in order to minimize my seizures.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.040
Normal people don't operate
on themselves, Marcy.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.169
-The Terminator, maybe, but that's it.
-It's just minimally invasive.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.546
Don't worry, I'll clean up the mess.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.798
It's not about the mess.

14:00.882 --> 14:04.761
The fact that you would do
something like this alone is insane.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.179
Well, you would've
made me go to the hospital.

14:07.263 --> 14:11.601
Yes! Surgery? Yes!
I mean, look at this place!

14:11.684 --> 14:14.937
It's just a little bit of blood.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.565
No, it's not.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.360
No, it's not. This...
this is a great deal of blood!

14:20.443 --> 14:22.529
How do you not...
How do you not recognize this?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.406
I mean...

14:24.489 --> 14:27.742
Oh, come on! I can't...
I can't keep doing this.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.452
Doing what?

14:30.327 --> 14:31.913
Pretending that this is normal.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.708
And it's not just this, it's everything.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.960
I mean, it's...
it's the staying out late all night

14:38.044 --> 14:39.879
without telling me where you are,

14:39.962 --> 14:42.632
it's... it's CPR
during phone conversations, it's the...

14:42.715 --> 14:45.009
How about the phone message saying
that you might be relocating?

14:45.092 --> 14:47.429
"Another time, another life."
What...

14:55.520 --> 14:59.982
And please stop kissing me
to just shut me up.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.067
That's not fair.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.782
Do you want me to leave?

15:08.866 --> 15:10.076
No.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.871
No. Do you know what it is?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.917
Stop trying to do everything alone.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.961
Let me in.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.297
Let me help you with the battle.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.009
Because I can't help but think
that whatever it is you're doing,

15:27.093 --> 15:28.886
it's a battle.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.264
Would you have helped me with this?

15:32.348 --> 15:33.725
Oh, God, no. No.

15:33.808 --> 15:39.146
But... I am here for you
for anything and everything non-surgical.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.736
Okay, maybe, like, minor surgery, like...

15:44.819 --> 15:46.446
Band-Aids.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.824
I can do Band-Aids.

15:52.827 --> 15:55.538
A'ight, get him up here.
Come on, let's go.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.874
Yeah, get his jacket.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.209
-No...
-Take your jacket off.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.669
Come on, everyone,
let's hear it for him!

16:01.753 --> 16:02.879
Why?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.508
-Why are you taking my jacket?
-You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.262
-Special Agent Grant MacLaren.
-Mmm.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.431
In recognition of your many years
of dedication to this bureau,

16:14.516 --> 16:17.309
the men and women of this division
would like to present you with...

16:18.227 --> 16:20.522
this token of our appreciation.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.233
Here's to 15 years, bruh.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.985
Come on, hold it up.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.658
-What are you doing? Come on.
-No, no, no, no.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.577
Here we go.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.914
There you go.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.667
- Kat, take a picture.
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.755
- I can't get in.
- Just swipe up.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.298
Did you... Did you change it?

16:52.595 --> 16:54.305
All right. Let's do this.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.558
Big smiles!
Come on, man.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.941
Hey, it's okay.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.277
We're just gonna play it
extra safe today, okay? Okay?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.166
Shit.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.218
Hey, Walt.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.721
- Hey, sweetheart, how are you?
- Mmm, good.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.473
Thanks so much
for putting this together for him.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.850
It means a lot.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.822
Yeah,
he's all right.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.326
So, how are things?
You look good. Everything fine now?

17:57.409 --> 17:59.621
Yeah, unless you know something I don't.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.831
Uh, no, it's just that Mac told me

18:01.914 --> 18:04.667
that he took you
to the doctor's the other day.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.460
You know what?
It's none of my business.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.671
-I never should've said anything.
-No, no, no, it's fine.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.923
It wasn't anything serious.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.258
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.802
Yeah, everything's good.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.888
We're good.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.557
- Should I top you up?
- Uh, yes, please.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.110
There you go.
I'm really sorry.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.324
Hey, what the fuck was that in there?

18:37.408 --> 18:38.660
Well, I don't know, dawg, you tell me,

18:38.743 --> 18:39.952
because you really botched it in there.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.162
-I did?
-Yeah.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.539
-Was I getting you all worked up?
-No! It was a terrible plan.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.582
-No, no! It wasn't a terrible plan!
-Yes, it was!

18:45.667 --> 18:47.459
-It was your plan!
-No, it wasn't my plan!

18:47.543 --> 18:49.211
It's your plan, Trevor!
We've done it 10 times, all right?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.964
You're killing me out here, man.
You are so off your game today.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.009
-What are these?
-It's benzos, your favorite.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.637
-This is my mother's medication.
-Trevor.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.847
-How did you get this?
-Are you kidding? Man, don't even.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.307
Are you stealing from my family?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.268
-You told me to!
-No, I didn't tell you to!

19:05.519 --> 19:08.690
-Look, man... just give me the pills.
-No, I'm not giving--

19:08.773 --> 19:10.357
Just be fair
and give me the pills, all right?

19:10.441 --> 19:11.483
I gave you the last stash!

19:11.567 --> 19:12.735
-We had a deal, bitch!
-Don't touch me!

19:12.819 --> 19:13.820
Come on, chill out, guys.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.321
Come on, Trevor,
your head's still healing.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.530
-I'm not in any danger.
-No, you're right.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.490
Just give me back the pills,
and you won't be.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.660
Walk away.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.833
Trevor.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.042
Don't.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.599
Trevor!

19:43.683 --> 19:45.727
Yeah, fuck you!

19:45.810 --> 19:48.229
- What?
- Are you okay?

19:56.946 --> 19:59.990
Okay, just sit back and close your eyes.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.705
What is this even supposed to do?

20:06.622 --> 20:10.126
This... is connected
to a nerve in your head.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.878
No, it's not.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.963
You know reflexology's not real medicine.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.422
Okay, next you're gonna tell me

20:15.506 --> 20:18.425
that the hip bone's
not connected to the leg bone.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.886
-It isn't.
-All right, you know what?

20:19.969 --> 20:23.097
I'm trying to help you relax,
so just play along?

20:23.180 --> 20:25.224
Okay, close your eyes.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.811
What happened here?

20:28.895 --> 20:32.189
Uh, it's nothing.
It's just a reaction from an injection.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.108
An injection of...

20:34.191 --> 20:36.027
An antitoxin.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.862
An antitoxin for...

20:40.322 --> 20:41.866
Marcy...

20:43.534 --> 20:45.411
You're seeing things.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.121
What do you mean?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.706
The psychotropic effects
of the antitoxins.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.127
You've been experiencing them
all day, kiddo.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.171
An antitoxin for what?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm just...

20:57.339 --> 21:00.551
I'm just experiencing
some side effects.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.595
Did you have anything to do
with that huge explosion at Van Huizen?

21:04.513 --> 21:06.348
You know about that?

21:06.432 --> 21:09.518
Well, it was the first mushroom cloud
we've had in the area

21:09.601 --> 21:11.771
in what seems like forever.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.355
It was all over the news.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.566
They said it was
a combination of spilt chemicals

21:15.649 --> 21:17.151
that accidentally combined with...

21:17.234 --> 21:19.111
I mean, why am I telling you?
You were there.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.530
They did say it was
just an accident, though.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.532
They evacuated the area in time...

21:23.616 --> 21:25.451
-...and no one was hurt.
-Marcy.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.203
Marcy.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.163
Marce?

21:29.246 --> 21:31.958
Marcy?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.625
Marcy, look at me.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.441
Hey, Mac, MacLaren.
Mac. Mac.

21:57.524 --> 22:01.028
We're talking about the time that
we had to evac out of the south shelter.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.073
Yeah.
The emergency alarm goes off,

22:04.156 --> 22:06.158
reveille bell's ringing bloody murder...

22:06.242 --> 22:08.327
People screaming...

22:11.622 --> 22:13.540
...and who comes walking in,
but 3468.

22:13.624 --> 22:14.917
"Shit!

22:15.001 --> 22:16.668
That warrant was in that other coat!"

22:23.217 --> 22:24.635
There you are, man.
Where's your drink at?

22:24.718 --> 22:25.761
No, no. I've had enough.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.389
Don't quit on me now, Mac.
You'll need courage for your speech.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.848
Nobody wants to hear me talk.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.601
- Who wants to hear Mac's speech?
- No, shh!

22:32.684 --> 22:34.186
I gotta take a piss.
I'll be... I'll be back.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.687
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.356
Just have some Scotch.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.739
Isn't this a great party, people?

22:49.451 --> 22:50.953
You know what you need?

22:52.163 --> 22:53.580
Something to love.

22:54.665 --> 22:57.293
It ain't good for a guy
to sit around that garage all day.

22:57.376 --> 23:01.130
You know, no sunshine,
no companionship, no girlfriend.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.339
You got a boyfriend?

23:02.423 --> 23:04.425
It's not a priority either way.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.803
What about a pet?
You need something to talk to

23:07.886 --> 23:10.181
other than your computer
or yourself.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.059
I've heard dog is a man's best friend.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.602
A puppy? Yeah, right.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.480
That's much better!

23:18.564 --> 23:22.068
Puppy's a lot of commitment, Phil.
It takes a whole lot of effort.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.737
You gotta pick up their shit.
They bark all the time.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.531
You can't travel anywhere.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.658
A professional gambler like you,

23:29.741 --> 23:32.786
you gotta be able to pick up
and fly to Vegas at any time, right?

23:32.869 --> 23:34.246
Right?

23:34.330 --> 23:36.207
Thanks, Ray. She's cute.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.625
You're welcome.
Yeah, look at her.

23:38.709 --> 23:41.212
All right, there's one more place
I want to take ya.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.757
You okay?

23:46.883 --> 23:48.760
Yeah, I think so.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.762
Come on, I thought
you were gonna kick that guy's ass.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.974
Yeah, well, look, Rene,
I'm sorry if who I am

23:53.057 --> 23:54.976
doesn't work for you anymore, okay?

23:55.059 --> 23:57.478
No, I like who you are.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.021
To be honest...

23:59.105 --> 24:02.358
I was never really
into that other stuff anyways.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.611
I kinda just played along.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.030
Really?

24:08.114 --> 24:09.615
True story.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.908
Okay, come on.
Let me show you something.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.827
Come with me.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.038
I think you're gonna like this.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.499
I know there's a camera here somewhere.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.176
Don't worry.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.803
I won't let them hurt you. Okay?

24:39.770 --> 24:42.356
No, it was a complete waste of time.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.732
I'm gonna have to cut it all out again.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.026
No, no, no. Come on.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.610
Slow down. Take a breath.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.492
I am so tired.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.328
I know.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.418
You really wanna help me?

25:03.877 --> 25:04.878
Anything.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.216
Not anything.
You said no surgery.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.720
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm not gonna operate on you.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.597
I mean, that's where I draw the line.
Sorry.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.225
It's more of a procedure.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.518
A simple one.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.395
Well, see, now, how simple?

25:21.478 --> 25:24.022
-Because you said the last one was minor.
-You can do this.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.607
I know you can.

25:27.609 --> 25:31.655
I wanted to ask you for a while,
but I was afraid that you'd say no.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.076
Okay.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.121
What do you want me to do?

25:49.005 --> 25:50.799
I know that you're staring at me.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.884
How?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.761
'Cause I'm highly trained.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.974
How do you do that?
Clear your mind?

25:59.933 --> 26:02.103
Most of the time, it's easy.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.607
But today I'm finding it a bit difficult.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.817
Am I distracting you?

26:10.944 --> 26:12.863
A lot's changed the last little while.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.950
What? Talk to me.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.163
I thought my life had purpose.

26:24.250 --> 26:30.214
And then, one day, I woke up
almost surprised to be alive, and...

26:33.134 --> 26:35.552
I found out that my purpose was gone.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.642
Everything that I've been doing...

26:43.101 --> 26:45.437
has been focused on this one mission.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.485
And now that there's no mission...

26:53.945 --> 26:56.157
I'm just living a stranger's life.

26:57.491 --> 27:02.204
It must be hard
not to be able to play football...

27:05.541 --> 27:06.583
But...

27:07.751 --> 27:09.420
just so you know...

27:10.462 --> 27:15.717
I was never with you 'cause
you were some superstar quarterback.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.430
-Really?
-No.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.309
It was the size of your dick.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.731
I'm kidding.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.484
- I'm kidding.
- Well...

27:34.445 --> 27:35.612
But honestly...

27:35.696 --> 27:38.490
even if that's not your mission anymore...

27:40.742 --> 27:43.495
you're still gonna be someone great.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.877
There's the 15-year man!

27:50.961 --> 27:52.087
- Oh, come on.
- Hey!

27:52.170 --> 27:53.839
Now, I was pretty reluctant
to do any of this,

27:53.922 --> 27:56.758
because, let's be honest,
he's a pretty lousy partner,

27:56.842 --> 27:58.219
but enough about his squash game.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.015
Let's hear it for our colleague
and our friend...

28:04.099 --> 28:07.102
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.688
Thanks a lot.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.816
Uh, thanks, partner.

28:12.899 --> 28:16.403
Um... it's a great afternoon.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.571
Isn't it?

28:26.413 --> 28:29.458
A lot of familiar faces here.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.131
I can't tell you
how strange it is to know that...

28:38.550 --> 28:40.886
I'll never see any of you again.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.807
Uh... until Monday,
uh, I mean.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.643
Monday...

28:47.726 --> 28:51.187
Um, so many stories from our past...

28:53.940 --> 28:56.235
So many I can't talk about.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.822
Teamwork... is everything, right?

29:00.906 --> 29:02.157
Uh...

29:02.241 --> 29:04.243
The people you work with, they're...

29:05.327 --> 29:06.828
they become your family.

29:07.788 --> 29:13.544
A shared history, a shared mission,
that's... that's what you hold onto.

29:15.629 --> 29:18.340
And my actual, uh, family,

29:18.424 --> 29:20.467
my... my wife, Kathryn. Uh...

29:20.551 --> 29:22.803
She... she holds me up.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.139
Probably literally tonight.

29:26.222 --> 29:27.223
Jesus.

29:27.308 --> 29:30.352
-Ah, ah, no, no.
-Come on! Come on! Come on!

29:33.397 --> 29:34.731
All right.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.149
Fifteen more years!

29:37.568 --> 29:39.278
Whoo!

29:43.990 --> 29:45.241
Thanks.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.119
Hey, maybe you should drive home.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.705
Let's go.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.506
Get in here!

29:59.590 --> 30:00.966
Just...

30:03.259 --> 30:05.220
- What's going on?
- Why don't you tell us?

30:05.304 --> 30:06.347
I, uh...

30:06.430 --> 30:08.349
Trevor, why did you steal my medication?

30:08.432 --> 30:09.433
I didn't steal your medication.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.477
Well, it sure as hell didn't get up
and walk away on its own!

30:11.560 --> 30:13.770
-Okay, okay!
-Look, Nick stole it.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.689
Nick? What the hell was Nick doing
in our bathroom?

30:15.772 --> 30:18.233
He was under the mistaken impression
that I wanted him to take it.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.360
Jesus!
What are you doing?

30:19.443 --> 30:21.612
You're lying, you're stealing,
and now you're doing drugs?

30:21.695 --> 30:23.238
No, I'm not doing drugs.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.490
Well, you look like you're high right now.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.408
- I'm not high. I--
- Take responsibility!

30:26.492 --> 30:28.118
-Be a man, for Christ's sake!
-That's enough.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.537
What? Like you, Gary?
That kinda man?

30:37.669 --> 30:39.546
I told you the truth.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.217
Here's your medication.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.261
Trevor!

30:51.517 --> 30:54.686
L3... L4...

30:54.770 --> 30:56.187
L5. Right there.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.773
Right there,
between L4 and L5.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.857
This is insane.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.942
I can't do this without you.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.195
You've already frozen the site.
It won't hurt as much as you think.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.867
Okay, okay...

31:19.878 --> 31:21.087
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.715
You're doing good.
You're doing good. Keep going.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.601
Oh, God, I...
I felt a pop.

31:34.685 --> 31:35.894
I'm sorry.
Something popped.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.354
No, it's good.
Keep going. Okay.

31:46.530 --> 31:47.656
Yeah?

31:47.739 --> 31:48.824
Okay.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.411
Really?
How much of this goes in?

31:52.494 --> 31:54.788
That's good.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.206
Okay.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.088
Oh, God, it's starting to leak.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.631
You're doing really good.
Keep going.

32:04.715 --> 32:07.342
Not really.
I'm kinda fainting over here.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.016
-Done?
-Okay.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.608
These used to be your favorite.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.200
-Okay.
-Oh, shit.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.620
Okay... I need to start analyzing the CSF.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.497
Oh, no, no.
Not now. Not now.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.581
Rest.

32:37.664 --> 32:41.042
Just... just rest.

32:42.085 --> 32:45.130
It's, uh...
pretend-doctor's orders.

32:57.350 --> 32:59.603
Looks clean.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.422
What do you want?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.050
Is this the residence of Miss Shannon?

33:30.133 --> 33:32.218
Who wants to know?

33:32.302 --> 33:35.931
I'm Jacqueline Peele
with Child Protective Services.

33:39.392 --> 33:43.730
Miss Shannon, it would be much better
if we had this conversation inside.

33:45.566 --> 33:46.942
Miss Shannon, I just have...

33:47.025 --> 33:48.860
-Why are you here?
-...a few questions for you.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.948
I'm just here responding to some concerns

33:53.031 --> 33:54.658
that were raised
about Jeffrey's situation here.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.910
Where is this coming from?

33:56.993 --> 33:58.954
Your husband.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.582
Jeff is not my husband.

34:01.665 --> 34:05.085
He's the father,
and we're obligated to follow up.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.755
What are you writing?

34:08.839 --> 34:11.883
Just my observations.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.387
Miss Shannon,
are you in some kind of trouble?

34:19.390 --> 34:20.684
Who are you, really?

34:21.476 --> 34:22.477
I beg your pardon?

34:22.561 --> 34:23.687
Who sent you?

34:24.980 --> 34:26.147
Who are they?

34:26.231 --> 34:27.899
What do they want from me?

34:27.983 --> 34:30.068
I've already told you,
I'm with Child Protective Services.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.778
Do you have a warrant to be here?

34:31.862 --> 34:33.238
A court order of some kind?

34:33.321 --> 34:36.532
No, this is an informal meeting,

34:36.617 --> 34:39.953
-but if you want me to leave--
-Yes, I do. Now.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.291
All right.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.253
I will have to make a note
that you refused this initial meeting...

34:48.336 --> 34:50.380
-Get out.
-...Miss Shannon.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.540
Walt seems good.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.001
Well, he's a machine.

35:28.084 --> 35:31.672
He said that you've been paying
more attention to me lately.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.840
Well, that's not so bad, is it?

35:33.924 --> 35:36.051
It's not true.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.468
What's not true?

35:38.511 --> 35:42.849
He said you left work early
to take me to an appointment?

35:42.933 --> 35:44.184
I did?

35:44.267 --> 35:46.019
No, Grant, you didn't.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.689
So what were you really doing?

35:48.772 --> 35:50.774
When?

35:51.566 --> 35:53.026
What were you really doing

35:53.109 --> 35:55.361
when you were supposed to be taking me
to the doctor?

35:55.445 --> 35:58.364
I'm not an idiot, Grant.
I've noticed the changes.

35:59.783 --> 36:03.244
The diet,
locking me out of your cell phone.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.830
Something's going on.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.042
Tell me. Tell me.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.755
I'm not who you think...

36:13.839 --> 36:14.840
What?

36:16.841 --> 36:18.593
You're not what? Tell me!

36:31.189 --> 36:33.108
I'm in love with you.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.992
I always have been.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.483
No, stay.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.731
I'm Colin, and I'm an addict.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.608
Hi, Colin.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.111
We'd like to welcome a newcomer.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.404
Would you please introduce yourself?

38:49.953 --> 38:51.412
The kid's shy.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.164
That's okay.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.624
Then why don't you start?

38:57.543 --> 39:01.840
I admitted I was powerless
over my addiction.

39:01.923 --> 39:04.342
I give over my will
and my life to the director.

39:05.510 --> 39:09.430
And I pray for the knowledge
of the director's will for me...

39:10.348 --> 39:12.558
and the power to carry it out.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.856
The director doesn't know.

39:17.939 --> 39:20.859
Thank you, Traveler 7294.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.828
I'm Traveler 3326.

39:32.913 --> 39:35.123
I've been in the 21st century
for five weeks now,

39:35.206 --> 39:37.125
and I am so fucking tired,

39:37.208 --> 39:39.127
I just wanna lie down and get high.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.798
The other day, we saved the world.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.383
Now what do I do?

39:47.468 --> 39:51.097
<i>I was selected and trained</i>
<i>to remember everything.</i>

39:51.181 --> 39:52.933
<i>Everything.</i>

39:53.016 --> 39:54.309
<i>Dates, coordinates,</i>

39:54.392 --> 39:55.977
<i>candidates, people.</i>

39:57.228 --> 39:59.147
<i>Every death. Every single one.</i>

40:01.942 --> 40:04.860
But I can't even remember my own face.

40:06.362 --> 40:09.865
The face I was born with
hundreds of years from now.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.164
But I guess that's okay.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.793
Because that's who I am now...

40:20.876 --> 40:23.004
and I'd better get used to it, right?

40:26.549 --> 40:29.719
I'm Philip, and I'm from the future.

40:33.806 --> 40:36.684
Go ahead and say it loud, kid.
That's all you got to do.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.231
Makes a difference.

40:49.572 --> 40:52.492
My name is Philip,
and I'm a heroin addict.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.786
- Hi, Philip.
- Hi, Philip.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.370
You do some redecorating?

42:21.497 --> 42:24.542
What happened to Protocol 5 indefinitely?

42:25.501 --> 42:27.545
Can't Trevor and Philip be friends?

42:29.672 --> 42:31.716
You're at least 100 years older than me.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.343
Well, I'm young at heart.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.428
Not so much.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.180
Okay, I need a couch to crash on.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.848
That I believe.

42:40.308 --> 42:43.018
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

42:43.103 --> 42:44.270
Thank you.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.148
It's been a weird day.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.901
You have any side effects
from the antitoxin?

42:50.985 --> 42:52.737
-Hallucinations? Voices?
-Yeah.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.741
Happens to me all the time, actually.

42:56.824 --> 42:57.867
Really?

42:58.701 --> 42:59.702
Yeah.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.456
That's some shit you deal with.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.835
I think it's starting to wear off.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.796
Yeah. Me, too.

43:15.801 --> 43:16.927
What is it?

43:17.970 --> 43:19.972
We just received a new mission.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.270
We're back on.
