{\an1}I won't hold you back
any longer.

18:10.889 --> 18:13.292
Good-bye forever.

18:13.358 --> 18:16.728
{\an1}Oh and Harvey,
keep my fur glued to your back.

18:16.795 --> 18:20.265
{\an1}As a going away present.

{\an1}Don't you dare follow me,

What?

[sobbing and panting]

18:36.982 --> 18:39.218
Mustache Mountain.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.923
Yeah, okay, this is gonna be
a good decision Dade.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.059
Go live alone as a hermit.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.827
You won't be a bother to no one.

18:48.894 --> 18:52.030
[grunting]

18:53.432 --> 18:55.734
This is a good spot
to live forever.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.171
This is--this is a good--
this is a simple life.

18:59.238 --> 19:02.374
[thunder rumbles]

19:03.242 --> 19:04.576
This is the worst.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.579
- [grunting loudly]

19:10.916 --> 19:12.718
{\an1}Phew.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.586
- Jeremy?
- [shrieks]

19:14.653 --> 19:15.854
Oh, darn it.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.256
{\an3}- Uh, what are you doing
up here?

19:17.322 --> 19:18.924
{\an1}- Oh, you know,
sometimes it's nice

19:18.991 --> 19:20.826
{\an1}to take a hike up here
all by myself.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.761
Just to get away from it all.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.329
Also, I'm very lost.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.031
{\an3}- You're preachi''
to the choir.

19:26.098 --> 19:30.102
{\an3}I'm lost too.
Emotionally lost.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.637
{\an3}Thank you.

19:31.703 --> 19:32.938
- I know how you feel.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.040
Sometimes I get sad too.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.875
{\an1}But you know
what always cheers me up?

19:36.942 --> 19:38.744
{\an1}A peanut butter and jelly
sandwich!

19:38.810 --> 19:41.380
- Stress eating, huh?
Been there, done that.

19:41.446 --> 19:42.848
{\an1}- No, no.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.017
{\an1}No, peanut butter and jelly
is my favorite kind of sandwich.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.752
{\an1}Here.
It'll make you feel better.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.320
- Um, no thanks.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.489
{\an3}My family doesn't believe
in mixing condiments.

19:50.556 --> 19:53.425
{\an3}Either you have just
peanut butter or just jelly.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.160
{\an3}Not both.
That's weird.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.829
{\an1}- Aw, come on.
You won't know until you try it.

19:57.896 --> 20:01.133
{\an3}- You know, I used to think
me and Harvey

20:01.199 --> 20:04.536
{\an3}were like two peas in a pod,
but the truth is,

20:04.603 --> 20:08.607
{\an3}we couldn't be
any more different.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.443
{\an3}Holy Bingo!
This is pretty good.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.712
{\an1}- Yeah, I love peanut butter
and jelly.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.615
{\an1}Peanut butter's salty
and the jelly's nice and sweet.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.651
{\an1}It's like, you know,
they're both different but--

20:19.718 --> 20:21.853
{\an1}but when you put 'em together
that's what--

20:21.920 --> 20:25.824
{\an1}You know, that's what
makes 'em so--so great.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.426
- Oh, my gosh.

20:27.492 --> 20:29.828
Harvey and I don't have
to be exactly the same

20:29.895 --> 20:31.196
to be best friends.

20:31.263 --> 20:32.931
We're not two peas in a pod.

20:32.998 --> 20:36.068
We're peanut butter and jelly!

20:36.134 --> 20:37.703
- Who isn't what now?

20:37.769 --> 20:39.237
{\an3}- Thank you, Jeremy,
for all that you've taught me.

20:39.304 --> 20:42.007
I got to go find Harvey!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.275
- Hey, Dade, are you gonna...

20:43.342 --> 20:46.678
Aw, I'm just gonna eat it.

might cheer you up!
