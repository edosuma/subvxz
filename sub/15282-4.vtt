WEBVTT

00:01.220 --> 00:03.440
Yeah, ***

00:03.450 --> 00:05.960
I know, it's ridiculous !

00:05.970 --> 00:08.810
And Tom wants to have another baby,
did I mention this ? 

00:10.140 --> 00:12.970
Let's see, I'm 38 years old,

00:12.980 --> 00:15.470
and I have runaway boze
growing out of my feet.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.130
19?

00:21.140 --> 00:22.360
You're guessing again.

00:22.370 --> 00:23.500
Because I don't know.

00:23.510 --> 00:25.910
Because you're not focusing.

00:29.940 --> 00:30.870
Damn it.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.010
Hey,what kind of language is that?

00:33.020 --> 00:34.880
Mom says it all the time.

00:34.890 --> 00:36.490
Mom is a grown-up.

00:36.790 --> 00:40.260
I know. I always wanted a girl,but
now that I have 2 boys,it just seems...

00:40.270 --> 00:41.770
Oh,damn it.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.000
No. I just spilled some wine.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.500
Well,it's doable.

00:47.510 --> 00:50.090
I got my whole life ahead of me,right?

00:51.240 --> 00:52.730
Lynn?

00:53.170 --> 00:54.830
Hello?

00:55.330 --> 00:56.430
Great.

00:58.660 --> 00:59.960
Tom,could you get that?

00:59.970 --> 01:02.910
I
- it's probably carol returning the dish from the potluck.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.450
You... Focus.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.000
Hey.

01:17.340 --> 01:19.660
It just ran out in front of the car.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.600
- Is it yours?
- Oh,my gosh.

01:21.610 --> 01:22.780
Uh,no.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.100
We don't have a cat.

01:24.110 --> 01:25.770
Could it maybe be one
of your neighbor's?

01:25.780 --> 01:27.940
I don't... I guess it's possible.

01:27.950 --> 01:28.780
Is it dead?

01:28.790 --> 01:30.650
Hayden,go in the other room.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.880
Well,it looks like there's a tag.

01:32.890 --> 01:34.780
Oh,don't touch it. It
might have a disease.

01:34.790 --> 01:38.230
There's a number. Do you think,uh,maybe
I could use your telephone?

01:38.240 --> 01:39.380
It's not working.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.470
What do you mean it's not working?

01:40.480 --> 01:41.590
I don't know. It died.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.110
Maybe the batteries.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.270
- You can use my cell.
- Thanks.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.190
Hey,those are some pretty nice
clubs. You must be a good player.

01:49.110 --> 01:52.270
Yeah,nice clubs,but my game is a wreck.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.790
That's weird. There's no signal.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.450
You got a bag?

01:55.460 --> 01:56.960
A bag?

01:57.330 --> 01:59.360
Like she said,it might have a disease.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.470
Yeah,sure. Just a second.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.200
- Y- you wanna step
in? - Yeah.Thank you.

02:08.259 --> 02:10.530
I don't see why we
have to get him a bag.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.180
It's called being neighborly.

02:12.190 --> 02:13.640
He's not our neighbor.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.640
Do we have to argue about this?

02:15.650 --> 02:18.940
Well,excuse me for not wanting a
dead animal brought into my house.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.910
Sorry. My friend is a little shook up.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.950
He was driving when we,you know...

02:29.290 --> 02:30.660
Yeah,sure.

02:33.090 --> 02:34.520
Little guy's a load.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.400
Should maybe double-bag it.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.370
Look,guys,uh,we were
just getting ready to eat.

02:39.380 --> 02:41.390
Oh,a family dinner. That's nice.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.810
Come home from playing golf,have
a nice meal,nice family.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.290
- You're a lucky guy.
- Yeah.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.480
Uh,so if you guys don't mind...

02:50.070 --> 02:52.380
Well,what are we supposed
to do with the cat?

02:52.840 --> 02:53.960
I don't know.

02:53.970 --> 02:55.220
Take it to a vet,I guess.

02:55.230 --> 02:57.780
What's a vet gonna do? It's dead.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.720
Hey,what kind of clubs are these anyway?

03:00.730 --> 03:02.760
Uh,guys,I don't want any trouble.

03:02.770 --> 03:03.710
We'll call the police.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.310
How you gonna do that?

03:05.770 --> 03:07.700
You could yell,I guess.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.760
You have to be real loud,though.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.140
Look,this is ridiculous.
You guys get out...

03:11.150 --> 03:12.140
Hey,don't touch me,bitch!

03:12.150 --> 03:13.700
Hey,who the hell do you think you...

03:14.100 --> 03:16.620
- Dad!
- Boys,get in your room.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.340
No,boys.

03:18.670 --> 03:19.840
Stay.

03:21.310 --> 03:22.830
The halbert family.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.470
They were murdered in their home last
night in the denver suburb of cherry creek.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.850
It's the third home invasion
like this in the last month.

03:28.860 --> 03:29.980
They kill everyone.

03:29.990 --> 03:32.450
Parents,kids,pets if they have them.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.340
Always families,nice neighborhoods.

03:34.350 --> 03:35.570
What do they take?

03:35.580 --> 03:37.150
Nothing they can't
fit in their pockets...

03:37.160 --> 03:38.280
Cash,jewelry.

03:38.290 --> 03:41.560
Hundreds of ways to get cash and
jewels without killing entire families.

03:41.570 --> 03:44.070
That's why home invasions
are so hard to profile...

03:44.080 --> 03:44.960
Multiple motives.

03:44.970 --> 03:50.280
National statistics show an uptick in home
invasions over the last few years,18% in colorado.

03:50.290 --> 03:52.510
You know it's bad if
they're inviting us back.

03:52.530 --> 03:53.280
Back?

03:53.290 --> 03:55.410
Well,things went bad after
the jonben\t ramsey case

03:55.420 --> 03:58.210
when a couple of agents publicly
criticized local detectives.

03:58.220 --> 03:59.830
Well,they didn't need
us to make them look bad.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.900
And that was in boulder.

04:00.910 --> 04:03.940
Yeah,but the statewide media ran with
it,and it took on a life of its own.

04:03.950 --> 04:05.920
Well,I talked to a lieutenant nellis.

04:05.930 --> 04:07.360
Trust me. They want our help.

04:07.370 --> 04:08.640
They need it.

04:08.650 --> 04:11.140
The first 2 invasions
were 20 days apart.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.570
This last one was just 9 days later.

04:13.580 --> 04:16.620
So they're killing in faster
cycles,acquiring a taste.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.690
And getting better at it every time.

{\a6}Halbert Neighborhood
CHERRY CREEK,COLORADO

04:53.470 --> 04:57.720
In the city,crime is taken as
emblematic of class and race.

04:57.730 --> 05:01.510
in the suburbs,though,it's
intimate and psychological,

05:01.520 --> 05:06.540
resistant to generalization,a
mystery of the individual soul...

05:06.550 --> 05:08.520
Barbara ehrenreich.

05:09.950 --> 05:13.390
Home invasions typically involve
the elderly and single females.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.860
The fact that entire families are
being targeted suggests multiple unsubs.

05:16.870 --> 05:19.620
Could mean gang-related,revenge
motive,personal business.

05:19.630 --> 05:22.300
I don't think any of these victims
are running in gang circles.

05:22.310 --> 05:23.920
Sewing circles,more like it.

05:23.930 --> 05:26.860
P.t.a.Moms,gray-flannel dads...

05:27.160 --> 05:29.020
These guys are killing the cleavers.

05:29.030 --> 05:30.060
Strange.

05:30.070 --> 05:30.940
The pattern?

05:30.950 --> 05:32.220
No,the cleavers.

05:32.230 --> 05:34.980
Of all the names for a
1950s idyllic tv family,

05:34.990 --> 05:37.960
I mean,it's rife with
violent implication.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.150
Kind of makes you wonder how the
writers really felt about suburbia,huh?

05:41.160 --> 05:42.140
Focus,please.

05:42.150 --> 05:45.280
Uh,ok,what
about,um,class-based uprising?

05:45.290 --> 05:46.370
Helter skelter?

05:46.380 --> 05:49.760
There's no graffiti,no messages,at least
not visible ones. There's no rituals.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.370
Manson's aim was to start a race war.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.230
There's no proof of any hate crime here.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.380
The parent murders are brutal,messy.

05:55.390 --> 05:57.100
The instruments vary.

05:57.110 --> 06:00.300
Uh,golf club,kitchen knife,iron.

06:00.310 --> 06:02.200
Household implements,symbols of family.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.320
But the kids were different.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.440
They died by injection,pentobarbital.

06:05.450 --> 06:08.800
It's a barbiturate sometimes used
as an anticonvulsant for epileptics,

06:08.810 --> 06:10.710
anxiety disorders,and state executions.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.390
The invasions are well planned.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.580
Phone lines are cut.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.840
Ligature marks show the
parents were bound and gagged.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.310
Look like these guys had
some robbery experience.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.730
And then found their true calling.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.020
No sign of forced entry.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.060
- Same as the other 2 houses,right?
- Yeah.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.740
So it's late,and the doorbell rings.

06:32.590 --> 06:35.540
I come over,and I flip the switch.

06:46.730 --> 06:48.130
They made it dark.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.730
No one sees anything
if they're walking by.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.180
But I can still see
through the peephole.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.360
If you look like trouble,I
might not let you in...

07:00.370 --> 07:04.230
But if you look
nonthreatening,maybe I open up.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.400
So the occupants either knew
them,or they lied their way in.

07:07.410 --> 07:10.220
With this kind of
overkill,there's usually history.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.480
Right.

07:11.790 --> 07:15.560
If it was just about eliminating
witnesses,it would never have been so vicious.

07:15.570 --> 07:16.790
This is rage.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.850
You think they know the families?

07:17.860 --> 07:18.960
It's possible.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.900
And then there's the kids...

07:20.910 --> 07:23.150
Tucked in,quiet,orderly,controlled.

07:23.160 --> 07:27.180
Speaks to an introvert with
some capacity for remorse.

07:27.390 --> 07:28.450
2 profiles.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.690
2 unsubs.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.320
Have these chairs been moved?

07:31.330 --> 07:33.360
No. It's all how we found it.

07:33.370 --> 07:37.280
So they've been positioned to face
the area where the parents were killed.

07:37.740 --> 07:40.090
Everything's been
cleared out like a stage.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.450
It's entertainment.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.710
They sit and watch the parents die.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.390
Maybe.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.520
I came by about 9:00
to return the pyrex.

07:51.530 --> 07:54.410
No one answered when I rang the
bell,but lights were on inside.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.750
Did you happen to look in the windows?

07:57.760 --> 07:59.060
Not then,no.

07:59.070 --> 07:59.910
I had my cell phone.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.150
I was gonna call,but I...

08:02.160 --> 08:04.230
I couldn't get a
signal,which was strange.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.630
Why was that strange?

08:05.640 --> 08:06.610
You always get a signal here.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.790
There's a tower on the next block.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.430
Uh,I left the dish.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.420
This morning,it was still here...

08:13.620 --> 08:15.450
So I came over.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.990
Th-that's when I looked inside.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.280
And you called the police on your cell.

08:21.990 --> 08:23.610
Yeah.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.100
These guys don't lack confidence.

08:25.110 --> 08:27.470
Targeting entire families
is a high-risk endeavor.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.910
It's possible they're minimizing that risk
by jamming cell phones inside the house.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.140
No one can call out.

08:32.150 --> 08:33.580
High tech. That narrows
the profile,right?

08:33.590 --> 08:34.400
not really.

08:34.409 --> 08:37.500
Oh,you can buy a hand-held
jammer online for what,100 bucks?

08:37.510 --> 08:39.880
I could use one of those
next time I go to the movies.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.850
Hey,girl. You're on speaker.Behave.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.110
Or what,you'll spank me?

08:49.080 --> 08:51.750
So I've been searching the
area for unsolved robberies.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.150
I found 4 with similar elements...

08:54.160 --> 08:56.850
Phone lines cut,small valuables only.

08:56.860 --> 08:57.810
Occupants tied up?

08:57.820 --> 08:59.510
- Yes,but no homicides.
- Ok.Thanks,dollface.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.660
I'll call you back.

09:01.030 --> 09:04.000
Well,if this is our guys,something
made them graduate to murder.

09:04.010 --> 09:07.370
If we can figure out what that trigger was,it
might tell us how they choose their victims.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.560
Well,that would help.

09:08.570 --> 09:12.370
I been lookin' into victimology,and so
far,there's really nothing to connect the families.

09:12.740 --> 09:16.550
Different political affiliations,different
careers,different school systems.

09:17.250 --> 09:21.290
At this point,it simply appears the unsubs
are targeting their victims at random.

09:21.460 --> 09:24.960
a reunion is in your future.

09:24.970 --> 09:26.710
Hey,what do you... What
do you think that means?

09:26.720 --> 09:28.240
It doesn't mean nothin'.

09:28.850 --> 09:30.630
It's a gimmick.

09:47.890 --> 09:48.890
ok.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.260
It's your turn.

09:50.270 --> 09:51.690
See anything you like?

09:53.120 --> 09:55.390
We just don't think it's a good idea.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.930
No,you haven't even thought about it.

09:56.940 --> 09:59.680
You're just too young to spend a
weekend with some boys. That simple.

09:59.690 --> 10:01.300
No,it's a whole group of us,dad.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.540
Look,I've earned some capital here.

10:05.550 --> 10:07.670
I should be able to
spend it however I want.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.100
Who are you,george bush?

10:09.110 --> 10:10.470
Don't laugh at me.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.890
Gosh,I do everything
you've ever wanted...

10:12.900 --> 10:14.530
Summer job,student government.

10:14.540 --> 10:16.100
Drill team. You like drill.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.050
Are you kidding?

10:17.060 --> 10:20.930
I do it to pad my r\sum\,to fulfill your
dreams of getting me into a good college.

10:20.940 --> 10:23.240
Oh,that's not fair,carrie.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.630
You know,just because you
two were losers in high school

10:26.640 --> 10:28.800
doesn't give you the
right to take it out on me.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.610
- ¿ad_nde vas?
- A lavar mis manos.

10:33.830 --> 10:36.740
Hey,you ever think about goin' home?

10:37.160 --> 10:39.480
- no.
- Visit the folks?

10:41.550 --> 10:42.570
Might be time.

10:42.580 --> 10:46.300
I... I don't wanna ever
go back there,not ever.

10:47.150 --> 10:48.420
I'm bored.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.430
Pick somebody,or I'm takin' your turn.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.460
Reunion.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.100
Hey.

11:32.470 --> 11:34.620
It just ran out in front of my car.

11:34.630 --> 11:36.220
Is it yours?

12:29.250 --> 12:31.200
god,what happened to you?

12:32.300 --> 12:33.990
They killed us.

12:35.770 --> 12:37.390
Call 911!

12:38.780 --> 12:41.450
We're looking for 2 men,probably
white,given the neighborhoods that

12:41.460 --> 12:44.680
they hit,mid to late
twenties,intelligent,and organized.

12:44.690 --> 12:46.220
These are career criminals.

12:46.230 --> 12:48.400
One or both has done hard time,

12:48.410 --> 12:50.230
but neither presents as a convict.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.440
They would appear
clean-shaven,well dressed...

12:53.450 --> 12:54.470
Neighborly.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.370
This helps them talk
their way into the homes.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.160
They may also be using a ruse.

12:58.170 --> 12:58.980
What kind of ruse?

12:58.990 --> 13:01.850
Given that the invasions have taken
place in the evening,it could be anything.

13:01.860 --> 13:05.010
Could be door-to-door sales,person
in distress,car trouble.

13:05.020 --> 13:09.860
Uh,derrick todd lee used a tape of a baby crying
to get women to open their doors in baton rouge.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.580
Never underestimate their creativity.

13:11.590 --> 13:16.320
These men share a very tight bond
and a mutual compulsion to kill,

13:16.330 --> 13:19.830
but their signatures reveal
2 very distinct personalities.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.570
One brutalizes the parents.

13:21.580 --> 13:22.970
This is the dominant one...

13:22.980 --> 13:25.900
Sadistic,remorseless,extremely volatile.

13:25.910 --> 13:27.360
The other prefers a needle.

13:27.370 --> 13:30.130
His injections are consistent
with an angel of death.

13:30.140 --> 13:34.650
He's more withdrawn,sensitive,and
he has a warped sense of mercy.

13:34.660 --> 13:38.700
Agent morgan is passing out a list of places
where he might have access to the drug he uses.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.840
- It's long,but...
- Hotch.

13:40.850 --> 13:42.940
There's been another one,and
they're sending an ambulance.

13:42.950 --> 13:45.020
- Ambulance?
- There's a survivor?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.170
She's lucky to be alive.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.240
The injection went into the soft
tissue of the arm,missed the vein.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.230
That's a first.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.510
This guy doesn't miss.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.860
Like I said,she's lucky.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.130
She conscious?

13:55.140 --> 13:56.310
She's in and out.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.430
Keep in mind she's suffering the
effects of an acute barbiturate overdose.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.330
She's drowsy,confused.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.480
Given what's happened,that's
probably best.

14:05.830 --> 14:08.630
You can inform the next of
kin,but ask them to keep it close.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.010
I don't want the media to
know there's a survivor.

14:17.930 --> 14:19.730
kid's in his room down the hall.

14:20.170 --> 14:22.240
- How old?
- 7

14:25.150 --> 14:26.330
You all right?

14:26.530 --> 14:28.750
Least they left the flowers alive,right?

14:28.760 --> 14:30.760
Looks like the bodies
were moved postmortem.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.820
The daughter had blood on
her when they found her?

14:32.830 --> 14:35.210
She must have woken up,come
out here,and found them.

14:35.220 --> 14:37.200
You answer your door,and
the next thing you know,

14:37.210 --> 14:39.630
everyone you care about is gone.

14:42.710 --> 14:45.490
If it was me,i'd wanna be gone,too.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.810
I went to get a bag...

14:50.350 --> 14:52.340
But when I got
back,there were 2 of them.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.550
What did the other one look like?

14:55.890 --> 14:57.200
Heavier...

14:57.950 --> 14:59.550
Hispanic...

15:00.310 --> 15:01.880
Quiet.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.350
He never looked straight ahead.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.970
What do you mean?

15:05.980 --> 15:07.480
Like...

15:08.310 --> 15:11.170
A few times,I felt him staring at me.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.600
When I looked up,he always looked away.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.610
Avoiding eye contact?

15:18.310 --> 15:20.930
Then my dad came in
from the study,and...

15:22.020 --> 15:24.120
They jumped him.

15:25.190 --> 15:29.660
They made danny call for my
mom,and they tied them up.

15:30.020 --> 15:34.010
And then one of 'em went over,got
the thing from the fireplace,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.520
he started hitting them with it.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.180
And they made us watch.

15:39.190 --> 15:40.960
Ok,you know what? We can take a break...

15:40.970 --> 15:42.180
no.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.200
You need this,right?

15:47.840 --> 15:51.930
After a while,the quiet
one took danny away,

15:54.100 --> 15:57.340
and the other one just started going
through drawers,looking for stuff.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.880
And I ran.

16:01.540 --> 16:02.660
Danny.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.510
Danny,we gotta go.

16:04.850 --> 16:06.030
It's better this way,lucy.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.380
What did you do to him?

16:07.390 --> 16:09.340
- Lucy,listen...
- My name's not lucy,you freak.

16:09.350 --> 16:12.160
- I could take care of you now.
- Please,por favor,dejame ir...

16:12.170 --> 16:16.320
I don't know what you're trying
to say,but you have to be quiet,ok?

16:16.330 --> 16:18.430
You're gonna make my brother mad.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.420
- Let's go.Let's go.
- No!

16:22.210 --> 16:23.240
Lucy,come on.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.340
hey,hotch!

16:37.100 --> 16:41.280
They only take things with monetary
value,right,jewelry and cash,no souvenirs?

16:41.290 --> 16:42.710
Far as we know.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.370
One of them just broke pattern.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.140
Witness says these
unsubs are using cats.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.810
We should find out where
they might be getting them.

17:02.820 --> 17:03.770
There's plenty of strays out there.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.579
Nobody would notice
if a few went missing.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.960
Or they could work someplace
where they had access to animals.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.380
Could overlap with the pentobarbital...

17:10.390 --> 17:12.119
Research labs,veterinary hospitals.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.750
I'll get garcia to make up a list.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.359
Carrie said that they referred
to each other as brothers.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.280
It's not uncommon for
duos to be related.

17:18.290 --> 17:19.839
The hillside stranglers were cousins.

17:19.849 --> 17:21.960
The carr brothers perpetrated
the wichita massacre.

17:21.970 --> 17:24.290
Yeah,but these two
are of different races,

17:24.300 --> 17:27.940
and carrie said the hispanic one did
not speak spanish,which makes me think...

17:27.950 --> 17:30.300
Raised in a white household.
Maybe they're half brothers.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.530
What if they're adopted?

17:31.540 --> 17:33.320
Family destruction plays
a role in the crimes.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.420
It could be a reflection
of their own broken home.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.030
This guy expressed affection for carrie.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.770
We know he took her photograph.

17:38.780 --> 17:39.920
We could use that.

17:39.930 --> 17:43.180
If we release news of her
survival,it might draw him out.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.880
Not comfortable with that?

17:44.890 --> 17:49.240
Ok,but I would be more comfortable
if we doubled her security.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.750
I know.I know.

17:55.670 --> 17:59.610
You were probably expecting some nice
family to take you away from all this,

17:59.620 --> 18:02.300
but that's a lie.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.600
They would have hurt you.

18:09.430 --> 18:11.990
You're one of the lucky ones,ok?

18:12.410 --> 18:13.870
Sleep.

18:14.380 --> 18:15.550
Sleep.

18:18.590 --> 18:21.400
Hey,ervin,you got a visitor.

18:29.430 --> 18:30.720
What did you do?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.060
W
- what did I do? I didn't do anything.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.830
That girl,she survived.
It's all over the news.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.020
She did?

18:37.030 --> 18:39.770
Yeah. She's probably telling
'em everything right now.

18:41.050 --> 18:43.180
Hey,man,I... I thought
it was a good shot.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.830
And this has nothing to
do with your little crush.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.230
Hey,it's not a crush. I
- it...

18:47.240 --> 18:49.100
It doesn't matter!

18:51.710 --> 18:53.080
Maybe this is a sign,gary.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.380
M
- maybe we should stop. I mean...

18:55.810 --> 18:58.250
- I'm making good money here.
- Screw the money.

18:58.890 --> 18:59.550
But the kids,they...

18:59.560 --> 19:01.210
The kids are better off.

19:01.220 --> 19:02.570
You know that.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.810
Don't go soft on me now.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.430
We're all we got. We're
family.We're family.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.080
Thank you for your time.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.020
Hey. So carrie's been cleared to go.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.960
Well,I wish she had somewhere to go.

19:20.140 --> 19:22.110
No luck with the l.a.Thing?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.480
Can't this girl catch a break?

19:37.680 --> 19:39.620
It just ran into the road.

19:39.630 --> 19:41.260
Is it yours?

19:50.380 --> 19:52.050
Carrie.Carrie.Carrie.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.860
Wake up.Wake up.Wake up.

19:54.220 --> 19:54.980
It's ok.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.140
Oh,it was daddy.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.210
It's ok. It's just a dream.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.330
Ok.

20:00.680 --> 20:01.600
I'm ok.

20:01.610 --> 20:03.060
- ok?
- Yeah.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.260
We,uh... We brought
you a change of clothes.

20:07.510 --> 20:12.030
I... I didn't know what to grab
you,so I just got three of everything.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.010
From the house.

20:17.030 --> 20:18.740
Looks like a flower shop in here.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.640
Yeah. They all started,um...

20:21.020 --> 20:23.540
Coming in after the news broadcast.

20:25.230 --> 20:28.250
Exact same floral arrangement
was in the ortiz living room.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.730
Could be coincidence.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.810
Or the sender was in the
house,associated it with her.

20:32.820 --> 20:33.540
No note?

20:33.550 --> 20:35.840
No,just a blank card
from the floral shop.

20:35.850 --> 20:39.170
Get garcia to track the delivery,and reid's
got something for us when you're done.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.180
Hey,garcia. It's em.

20:42.190 --> 20:43.830
- Why cats?
- Sorry?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.860
Evil has no boundaries.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.140
Well,for what it's worth,I
think they go peacefully.

20:48.150 --> 20:49.790
Yeah. How do I catch these guys?

20:50.670 --> 20:53.290
Uh,back-trace a flower delivery for me.

20:53.300 --> 20:57.150
This is the laybourne house,where we believe
our unsubs graduated from robbery to murder.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.440
Did you find a trigger?

20:58.450 --> 21:00.540
Not until I looked at the
daughter's autopsy reports.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.700
Uh,check out the bruises on her torso.

21:02.710 --> 21:03.610
She was beaten?

21:03.620 --> 21:05.280
But not by our unsubs.

21:05.290 --> 21:08.310
The coroner noted those
bruises were several days old.

21:08.320 --> 21:12.110
Uh,it turns out she'd been to the
emergency room 3 times in less than 2 years.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.630
The d.s.Had even been notified.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.880
So the laybournes were abusing
their daughter. Where's this going?

21:15.890 --> 21:19.050
One of the unsubs
decimates parental figures,

21:19.060 --> 21:21.070
but we know the
statistics there. It's...

21:21.080 --> 21:22.920
It's likely he was abused himself.

21:22.930 --> 21:26.120
So you're saying the unsub
recognized the signs of abuse,

21:26.130 --> 21:27.690
flew into a rage,and killed the parents?

21:27.700 --> 21:30.470
Anger displacement. He's getting
revenge for his own childhood abuse.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.240
So you think what,the victims
were beating their kids?

21:33.250 --> 21:35.270
Uh,the laybourne case
was just the trigger,

21:35.280 --> 21:37.110
but now they see all parents the same.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.410
That doesn't explain the kids.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.560
Maybe it does.

21:39.570 --> 21:42.720
Think of the family annihilators
john list and mark barton.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.880
They thought they were saving
their kids by killin' 'em.

21:44.890 --> 21:46.480
But what is he savin' them from?

21:46.490 --> 21:49.430
Life without their
parents,without love,life like his.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.490
They're orphans.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.960
What if they both grew up
in a third-party household?

21:52.970 --> 21:54.130
What,like a foster home?

21:54.140 --> 21:56.230
Didn't carrie describe an
aversion to eye contact?

21:56.240 --> 21:57.490
Oppositional defiant disorder.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.620
Often seen in kids who
grew up in foster homes.

21:59.630 --> 22:02.390
Guys,I think we may have found
our girl's secret admirer.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.710
- Garcia traced the flowers?
- Yep.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.240
Paid for by phone with a credit
card under the name robert serrano.

22:37.270 --> 22:38.620
Detective.

22:38.630 --> 22:41.110
Flowers weren't the only thing they
bought on that stolen credit card.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.010
$31 worth of gas at a
station 3 blocks from here.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.450
Hey,paul. Paul.The station...

22:45.460 --> 22:47.770
See if you can pull the security
camera footage,i.d.That car.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.000
Security chain's been broken.

22:49.010 --> 22:51.210
They couldn't lie
their way in this time.

22:51.220 --> 22:52.640
Media blew their m.o.

22:52.650 --> 22:55.220
They're speeding
up,feel us getting close.

22:55.230 --> 22:56.930
This is close?

23:00.940 --> 23:02.350
Talk to me,garcia.

23:02.360 --> 23:06.010
So,felons in the denver
area with foster background,

23:06.020 --> 23:07.810
stress on assaults and burglaries.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.110
- What'd you get?
- The phone book.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.520
Foster system's a bit of a
breeding ground,go figure.

23:11.530 --> 23:12.350
Well,try crossing it with...

23:12.360 --> 23:15.580
With offenders having workplace access
to small animals and/or pentobarbital?

23:15.590 --> 23:17.000
- How many names?
- 9

23:17.010 --> 23:20.150
Matching all 3 criteria.
Sending them now.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.950
Now we're close.

23:25.310 --> 23:27.340
Cameras at that gas station
grabbed a visual of the car.

23:27.350 --> 23:29.720
Oldsmobile,mid-eighties,partial
plate only.

23:29.730 --> 23:30.650
Anything on the driver?

23:30.660 --> 23:31.530
It was fuzzy.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.030
Well,then I guess it's
gonna be up to her.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.460
She up for it?

23:36.470 --> 23:38.160
I don't know.

23:40.330 --> 23:41.430
This one.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.850
Are you sure?

23:44.020 --> 23:46.420
Ok,that's a ervin robles.

23:46.430 --> 23:48.460
Last known is 39 hill street.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.450
That's downtown.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.320
Employed by the denver city pound.

23:51.330 --> 23:52.740
Let's go.

23:53.670 --> 23:56.160
Your parents would be
really proud of you.

23:57.490 --> 23:59.230
It's too late to be a good daughter now.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.310
Oh,that's not true.

24:02.410 --> 24:04.640
I was horrible to them.

24:05.580 --> 24:07.560
And now they're gone.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.720
Why did they do it?

24:12.860 --> 24:14.430
I mean,there has to be a reason,right?

24:14.440 --> 24:18.330
Oh,you'll drive yourself crazy
trying to figure out the reason.

24:19.770 --> 24:22.700
I go crazy every time I close my eyes.

24:22.710 --> 24:28.240
It may have something to do with what
happened to them when they were younger.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.020
Like what,they were abused or something?

24:31.030 --> 24:32.860
There's a good chance.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.700
Are there any happy families?

24:44.610 --> 24:45.820
Thank you.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.230
Excuse me,sir.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.630
I'm agent hotchner with the fbi.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.880
This is agent prentiss.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.450
We're looking for ervin robles.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.850
Ervin's off till the weekend.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.030
Do you have any idea
where we might find him?

24:57.040 --> 24:58.660
You might want to try his apartment.

24:58.670 --> 25:00.030
We've been there. It's abandoned.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.650
Where do you send his checks?

25:01.660 --> 25:03.610
He picks them up. What's this about?

25:03.620 --> 25:05.240
We'd just like to talk to him.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.890
Who can we talk to
that actually knows him?

25:06.900 --> 25:08.390
Well,nobody,really.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.570
He comes in,does his job,and leaves.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.010
Real quiet. Efficient,though.

25:12.020 --> 25:12.710
Doing what?

25:12.720 --> 25:14.840
Well,actual title's
animal care technician,

25:14.850 --> 25:18.370
but,really,he's kind of
the on-site kevorkian.

25:20.050 --> 25:22.100
We need you to call him.

25:22.110 --> 25:24.540
Supervisor left a message for
ervin to come in right away.

25:24.550 --> 25:25.720
Work emergency.

25:25.730 --> 25:29.360
He also said a man stopped by yesterday,got
into a heated argument with ervin.

25:29.370 --> 25:31.360
The description sounded a
lot like the one carrie gave.

25:31.370 --> 25:32.850
The partner... Did he say
what they were fighting about?

25:32.860 --> 25:33.740
He couldn't hear it.

25:33.750 --> 25:35.060
We need a name on this guy.

25:35.070 --> 25:37.580
Well,until we find ervin,there's
only one person that can tell us that.

25:37.590 --> 25:38.500
The foster mom.

25:38.910 --> 25:40.850
My god. Ervin?

25:40.860 --> 25:44.640
Well,I mean,he had behavior
problems. They all do.

25:44.650 --> 25:46.410
But nothing we couldn't handle.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.520
And he hasn't been acting
alone,Mrs.Manwaring.

25:48.530 --> 25:49.380
He's got a partner.

25:49.390 --> 25:52.010
Perhaps someone else
who grew up in your care.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.060
Tyler,the adults are talking here.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.200
I just want some milk.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.420
- Can you open the fridge?
- You know the rules.

26:07.630 --> 26:10.510
They'll eat you out of house
and home if you let them.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.970
Is there anyone ervin
was especially close to?

26:12.980 --> 26:14.500
Someone he would have looked up to?

26:14.510 --> 26:16.500
Somebody who protected him?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.450
Gary.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.300
We tried with him,but...

26:26.310 --> 26:27.450
He tested us.

26:27.460 --> 26:28.650
Have you kept in touch with him?

26:28.660 --> 26:29.620
Oh,god,no.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.810
Gary left the day he
turned 18,never looked back.

26:33.110 --> 26:35.610
Ervin was a mess when he got here.

26:35.620 --> 26:37.770
Got separated from a younger sister.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.100
Where did she go?

26:39.110 --> 26:40.250
Nobody told me.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.480
Siblings get separated all the time.

26:42.490 --> 26:44.820
But they find new ones here.

26:44.830 --> 26:46.770
Like ervin found gary?

26:47.370 --> 26:50.400
What was the name of his sister,the
one he was separated from?

26:50.410 --> 26:51.930
Oh,let me think.

26:51.940 --> 26:54.620
He used to call her name out in the middle
of the night,wake the whole house up.

26:54.630 --> 26:56.320
Hal,what was that girl's name?

26:57.060 --> 26:58.610
Rosie,I think.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.190
- Lucy?
- Yes!

27:00.200 --> 27:02.220
Lucy,lucy,that was it.

27:02.230 --> 27:03.770
Carrie said he called her lucy.

27:03.780 --> 27:05.130
Hotchner.

27:05.140 --> 27:06.580
Yeah,just leaving.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.910
Ervin returned the call.
He's on his way to work.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.570
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

27:14.870 --> 27:17.480
Subject spotted approaching
on foot from north alley.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.060
Ervin robles,right there!

27:21.070 --> 27:23.350
Get your ass down on
the ground right now!

27:23.360 --> 27:24.510
Ervin!

27:26.000 --> 27:27.080
Where you goin',ervin,huh?

27:27.090 --> 27:28.470
Why are you running?

27:32.470 --> 27:33.440
Give me your hand.

27:36.530 --> 27:37.720
Let's go.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.970
You're not helping yourself
if you don't talk to me.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.640
He's giving me nothing.

27:57.230 --> 27:58.270
Do you want another crack at him?

27:58.280 --> 28:00.310
No. We can't keep
going around like this.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.120
So let him stew. Wear him down.

28:02.130 --> 28:03.860
We don't have time.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.510
We need him to find gary.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.260
Kids who grew up like he did,they're
incapable of forming attachments.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.030
It's not like we're
gonna earn his trust.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.260
Their whole m.o.Was predicated on
the union of their two personalities,

28:13.270 --> 28:15.990
and with ervin out of the picture,there's
no telling what gary could do.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.220
So he won't talk to us.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.590
But maybe he'll talk to family.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.560
Right this way.

28:21.990 --> 28:24.820
Remember,he'll be
in,uh,handcuffs,leg irons.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.190
There'll be nothing to worry about.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.020
And I will be in there with you.

28:28.030 --> 28:29.340
ok.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.970
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to,carrie.

28:33.220 --> 28:34.130
I do.

28:34.140 --> 28:35.570
Remember,we're interested in gary.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.610
His whereabouts,his next move.

28:37.620 --> 28:39.790
I will keep him on
point about that,carrie.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.860
Just try your best to keep him engaged.

28:42.870 --> 28:44.210
This way.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.370
Ok,I'm... I'm sorry.Can...

28:46.380 --> 28:48.570
Can we just stop and think
about this for a minute?

28:48.580 --> 28:50.440
- She'll be ok.
- She's a kid.

28:50.820 --> 28:52.940
What is she trying to prove here?

28:53.340 --> 28:55.900
That she can be a good daughter.

29:00.710 --> 29:03.210
Hey. You're here.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.270
Did you,uh,did you get
the flowers that I sent?

29:11.280 --> 29:12.830
Yeah.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.030
Pretty.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.630
They were to say that,uh...

29:17.640 --> 29:19.450
That I'm sorry.

29:22.430 --> 29:24.610
Flowers aren't enough,ervin.

29:24.620 --> 29:26.140
We need gary.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.790
That won't make it up,though.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.980
It's a start.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.290
no!

29:31.300 --> 29:33.720
They're gonna send you away now.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.960
Don't you see? That's what
they do with all the strays.

29:35.970 --> 29:37.580
They send them away.

29:38.370 --> 29:41.750
That's why I make them go to sleep,

29:42.070 --> 29:44.900
so that they don't have to suffer.

29:45.270 --> 29:48.470
Ervin,more people are going to
suffer if we can't find gary.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.560
So when you killed my brother,you
were doing him a favor?

29:51.570 --> 29:52.340
It's true.

29:52.350 --> 29:53.300
And what about me?

29:53.310 --> 29:55.240
Let's just address one thing at a time.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.530
I just wanted to see you again.

29:57.540 --> 30:00.500
You look so much like lucy,I just...

30:01.400 --> 30:02.550
I couldn't... I...

30:02.560 --> 30:04.130
I know... I know it's selfish,but...

30:04.140 --> 30:05.860
Selfish?

30:05.870 --> 30:06.770
It's insane.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.240
Ok,carrie,let's take a break.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.710
What happened to you that was so bad?

30:15.850 --> 30:18.050
She used to make it...

30:18.060 --> 30:19.700
Go dark.

30:19.710 --> 30:22.140
I mean,that's what we used to call it.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.590
She would...

30:23.600 --> 30:26.770
Put me in the bath to pray.

30:29.190 --> 30:33.930
And then she'd hold my
head down under the water.

30:34.530 --> 30:37.350
Sometimes I could stay awake...

30:38.340 --> 30:41.160
For like a minute...

30:42.620 --> 30:45.290
And sometimes a little more.

30:47.060 --> 30:48.820
Then it would all go dark.

30:48.830 --> 30:50.260
They've still got kids in that house.

30:50.270 --> 30:51.790
Another kid,another welfare check.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.730
Let's call d.s.And see if
we can get them out of there.

31:00.350 --> 31:02.410
What is she doing?

31:03.540 --> 31:05.630
They can't hurt you anymore,ervin.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.430
I wanted to stop,but gary,he...

31:08.950 --> 31:12.340
He went through it way,way
worse when we were kids,and he...

31:12.980 --> 31:15.230
He never got the chance to fight back.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.000
So he fought those other families.

31:19.650 --> 31:22.690
Only because I wouldn't go back.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.310
Back?

31:25.370 --> 31:29.410
Gary's going to your
foster home,isn't he?

31:31.550 --> 31:33.750
Get him out of there.

31:43.430 --> 31:44.350
Carrie.

31:45.130 --> 31:46.400
Oh,you did so good.

31:47.790 --> 31:49.370
you did good.

31:57.190 --> 31:58.020
What is all this?

31:58.030 --> 32:00.970
We have reason to believe that gary
may be on his way here to hurt you.

32:00.980 --> 32:01.970
Me?

32:01.980 --> 32:04.450
- I don't understand!
- These murder are rehearsals of what he wants to do to you.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.300
'cause of what you did
to him in this house.

32:06.310 --> 32:08.660
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Ma'am,we don't have time to debate this.

32:08.670 --> 32:11.040
The fact is,you and your
husband are in danger.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.270
- I...I have to pick up the children at school.
- We'll send someone to pick them up.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.730
The only way we can protect
you is if you go back inside.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.790
Hey,buddy.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.050
You don't remember me?

32:45.060 --> 32:46.930
I used to live in your
house,a long time ago.

32:46.940 --> 32:47.810
You were just a little guy.

32:47.820 --> 32:49.430
We're not supposed to talk to strangers

32:49.440 --> 32:51.350
you're not supposed to wear
your shoes in the house,

32:51.360 --> 32:54.140
not supposed to go to the
bathroom after bedtime.

32:54.150 --> 32:56.900
Does she still wear the
refrigerator key around her neck?

32:58.260 --> 33:00.420
I'm gary. I'll give you guys a ride.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.230
Come on.

33:23.420 --> 33:27.000
Witnesses saw the kids getting into a late
eighties oldsmobile about 20 minutes ago.

33:27.010 --> 33:29.200
I heard. Denver p.d.Set
up a 20 mile perimeter.

33:29.210 --> 33:30.840
What does he want with the kids?

33:30.850 --> 33:33.550
With ervin out of the way,maybe
gary's trying to do his job.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.530
He makes them sleep.

33:37.200 --> 33:37.910
Reid,what?

33:37.920 --> 33:38.560
We got him.

33:38.570 --> 33:40.750
He's at a donut shop 2
miles from the school.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.420
Black and whites saw
the car,called it in.

33:42.430 --> 33:43.680
Kids?

33:44.480 --> 33:48.050
Ah,we got a visual on gary and
the boy,but I don't see the girl.

33:49.670 --> 33:51.700
- Are you the police?
- Yeah.

33:52.770 --> 33:55.010
He told me to give this to you.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.570
We might have a problem,hotch.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.350
Guys,guys,fall back,I don't
want them feeling boxed in.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.230
I got sharpshooters lining up.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.000
Tell them to keep their safeties on.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.120
I want to talk to him first.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.460
If you come in.I'll kill him.

34:19.610 --> 34:20.840
- Hotch?
- Yeah?

34:20.850 --> 34:22.190
Got the clerk.

34:24.190 --> 34:27.340
That guy sitting at the table with the
little boy, i'd like to speak to him,please.

34:28.290 --> 34:30.820
You,uh,got a call over here,man.

34:31.150 --> 34:32.960
Grab your stuff. Come on.

34:42.710 --> 34:43.340
Who's this?

34:43.350 --> 34:46.179
I'm the only thing standing
between you and a bullet.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.429
Bring it.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.159
I always wanted to die in a donut shop.

34:53.170 --> 34:55.090
And never see ervin again?

34:56.100 --> 34:58.500
He told us what the manwarings
did to you in that house.

34:58.510 --> 35:00.330
I don't care what he
told you,it's history.

35:00.340 --> 35:03.350
They're the objects of your
anger,gary,not that little boy in there.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.060
It's too late for the boy,regardless.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.550
No,it's not. It's not,gary.

35:07.940 --> 35:11.110
And deep down,I think you know
that he still has a chance.

35:11.490 --> 35:13.470
He doesn't have to be you.

35:16.410 --> 35:17.950
Maybe.

35:18.260 --> 35:19.730
Maybe not.

35:20.670 --> 35:22.870
So what say we leave it up to him.

35:24.050 --> 35:25.960
What is it? What'd he say?

35:31.860 --> 35:33.950
- Tyler!
- Come here!Come on.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.510
Gary,put your hands up
where I can see them.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.530
Don't move!

35:57.540 --> 35:59.100
Get down on your knees.

35:59.110 --> 36:01.180
Interlace your fingers behind your head.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.210
Give me this hand.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.830
Give me this hand.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.520
Get on your feet.

36:28.310 --> 36:30.440
I don't know what you did,but nice work.

36:32.410 --> 36:33.910
Thanks.

36:34.810 --> 36:36.820
Yeah,I understand that,I'm just...

36:36.830 --> 36:39.760
I'm asking if there's some
type of alternative for them.

36:41.640 --> 36:42.950
Nothing?

36:43.920 --> 36:45.660
Yes,I got it.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.350
Don't ask me to like it.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.460
Well,what? What is it?

36:48.470 --> 36:51.970
Social services won't intervene
until they do a full investigation.

36:51.980 --> 36:53.780
We have to take them home?

36:53.790 --> 36:54.880
Yeah.

37:04.050 --> 37:05.610
Hang on a second.

37:11.050 --> 37:13.030
I teach cris negotiation.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.950
I co-wrote the
textbook,and in 12 years,

37:14.960 --> 37:17.220
I've never talked anybody
off a ledge so fast.

37:17.230 --> 37:20.290
Oh,bit of a milestone,huh?

37:21.080 --> 37:23.500
Why'd you walk out that door,gary?

37:23.930 --> 37:25.670
Sugar crash.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.920
Tyler...

37:38.930 --> 37:40.790
I need to talk to you for a second.

37:41.870 --> 37:43.760
Kid,listen to me.

37:44.180 --> 37:48.550
Anything you ever need,any problem
you might be having here at home,

37:49.250 --> 37:51.240
I want you to know you can call me.

37:51.990 --> 37:53.760
Any time,tyler.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.450
You understand? Any time.

38:19.490 --> 38:21.290
This sucks.

38:23.990 --> 38:25.940
So meet at 4:30 on the stairs,

38:25.950 --> 38:29.470
and you can direct all your questions to
lieutenant nellis of the denver p.d.,all right?

38:29.480 --> 38:31.680
- They'll be taking everything.
- What happened next?

38:32.880 --> 38:34.270
You're welcome.

38:35.060 --> 38:38.360
I didn't know anything was up
until he,uh,came and got the phone.

38:38.370 --> 38:40.270
That's when I saw the piece.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.070
Then I handed him the phone.

38:42.950 --> 38:44.740
Excuse me,did you say piece?

38:44.750 --> 38:47.380
Uh,yeah,revolver of some sort.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.640
He had it stuck in his pants.

38:48.650 --> 38:50.630
- Did you clear a gun?
- No.

38:55.540 --> 38:56.300
Yeah,reid?

38:56.310 --> 39:00.780
Hotch,the clerk said gary had a
gun,but we didn't recover anything here.

39:00.790 --> 39:02.820
- You sure?
- Yeah.

39:02.830 --> 39:05.350
I saw nellis turn him inside
out. He had nothing on him.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.060
I guess it's probably here somewhere.

39:07.070 --> 39:09.870
a gun doesn't just walk away.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.680
hotch?

39:21.210 --> 39:22.760
yeah,hotch?

39:24.240 --> 39:26.600
we just dropped them off. We're leavin'.

39:28.130 --> 39:29.410
the backpacks? No,why?

39:29.420 --> 39:31.340
Why would we search the back...

39:46.810 --> 39:48.090
Tyler!

39:48.100 --> 39:49.630
drop that gun.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.000
- Are you hurt?
- No.

39:54.230 --> 39:55.080
Tyler...

39:56.710 --> 39:58.610
come on,kid,take it easy.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.810
they're lies.

40:06.330 --> 40:07.700
I know.

40:07.980 --> 40:10.720
but you could have come in here,and
you could have made her pay,

40:10.730 --> 40:13.220
and you didn't,because you're good.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.500
you're not gary.

40:16.510 --> 40:19.480
no. you're nothing like him.

40:22.550 --> 40:23.900
look at me.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.350
I don't want to hurt you.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.700
ok?

40:32.010 --> 40:34.180
let's make a deal.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.490
you give me that gun,and I promise you,

40:37.500 --> 40:41.840
I will walk you out of here and
you will never have to come back.

40:44.470 --> 40:46.780
sound pretty good?

40:47.940 --> 40:49.910
yeah?

40:50.740 --> 40:52.580
ok.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.650
give me the gun.

41:04.340 --> 41:05.660
I got you.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.850
I got you.

41:20.110 --> 41:21.680
I could take her.

41:23.140 --> 41:24.970
- Take her?
- Carrie.

41:26.450 --> 41:28.060
To D.C.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.460
- You mean to live with you?
- Yeah.

41:31.380 --> 41:32.850
why would you want to do that?

41:32.860 --> 41:36.530
I have room,money,and,you
know,she's smart.

41:36.540 --> 41:38.430
2,3 years,she goes to college.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.020
Prentiss...

41:40.430 --> 41:44.950
this is the job,and I need to
know that you can be objective.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.860
and I need to know that I can be human.

41:50.020 --> 41:53.370
J.J.heard from the family,and
they're on their way from l.a.

41:59.950 --> 42:02.720
That's... That's great.

42:09.550 --> 42:11.070
Tell me they restocked the bar.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.530
I called ahead.

42:13.630 --> 42:16.580
Do you... Do you mind
waking him up?I just...

42:16.590 --> 42:18.990
I just want to hear his voice.

42:19.690 --> 42:20.680
Thanks.

42:28.650 --> 42:29.930
You ok?

42:30.380 --> 42:31.860
Yeah.

42:34.710 --> 42:36.570
They're good people.

42:36.580 --> 42:38.110
Carrie's family.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.000
Good.

42:40.350 --> 42:41.920
I'm glad.

42:45.750 --> 42:48.110
I think it's a good idea,though.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.830
What's that?

42:49.840 --> 42:53.130
You. Kids.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.150
I can see it.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.200
Yeah?
