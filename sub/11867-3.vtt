WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.699
ZOE: Previously on Eureka.

00:02.753 --> 00:04.038
I want to continue
Kim's research.

00:04.087 --> 00:07.375
So you think you can put
this tragedy behind you.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.416
HENRY: Never.

00:10.552 --> 00:14.545
BE VERL Y: According to
Nathan Stark, the artifact
appears to be dead.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.598
Energy of that magnitude
doesn't just die.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.311
It had to go somewhere.

00:26.026 --> 00:31.237
How about this Saturday night,
you, me, ribs, root beer
and ESPN Classic?

00:31.240 --> 00:32.446
How about this Saturday night,
you, me, ribs, root beer
and ESPN Classic?

00:32.741 --> 00:36.359
They're showing
the Lakers game we went to
around your ninth birthday.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.571
It was my sixth.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.910
Yeah.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.248
Actually, I was thinking
more like Red Bull and
pizza at Pilar's house.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.034
Oh.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.204
'Cause it's your birthday,
so I figured it could be great
to do something together.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.043
Just the two of us.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.794
Yeah.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.587
That's nice, but, you know,
I'm turning 16, not 60.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.882
Which still qualifies you
as a minor. Wearing that
doesn't qualify as a shirt.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.766
So, put on a jacket.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.263
We're in the middle
of a heat wave.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.727
SARAH: Today's forecast
calls for heat, frost,
rain, hail,

01:07.776 --> 01:10.358
gale force winds
and severe lightning.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.437
I'll have Fargo
give her a checkup.

01:13.532 --> 01:14.521
(SIGHING)

01:14.658 --> 01:16.865
You know, ljust...
I want to do
something normal,

01:16.910 --> 01:19.572
like a party
with my friends.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.327
Hmm.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.577
I think I liked it better
when you were six.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.424
Hey, Pilar.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.591
Whoa! What are
you doing?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.418
Dad!

01:37.139 --> 01:38.595
Hey, Sheriff.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.844
Bye,Shenﬁ.

01:41.935 --> 01:46.554
Oh, Pilar, just so you know,
Zoe already has
plans for her birthday.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.557
Oh. Bummer.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.941
Yeah. Bummer.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.484
Okay, enough mortification.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.186
Have a great day.

01:58.577 --> 02:02.365
l'll remember this when
you're getting arrested
on Dateline.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.744
Nice. No, we're plan...
The surprise party.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.162
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

02:08.253 --> 02:13.247
Hey, Kevin, what is
November 3, 1957?

02:13.342 --> 02:14.582
Tuesday.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.879
Oh, I'm pretty sure
it was a Thursday.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.179
Nope. Tuesday.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.844
Whatever.
I'm still going to
look it up.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.011
(LAUGHS)

02:21.058 --> 02:23.515
Have a good day, sweetie.
Good luck.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.684
He's in
a great mood.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.345
Yeah. He's been
different recently,

02:28.523 --> 02:29.899
like he's opening up.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.064
That's great. It's...

02:33.070 --> 02:34.310
Isn't it?

02:34.738 --> 02:36.319
Yeah. Of course.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.395
(MUMBLING)

02:37.491 --> 02:38.856
Yeah, yeah.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.739
So, are you
going to come to
Zoe's surprise party?

02:42.829 --> 02:45.036
Oh, me?
I thought you were
into young brunettes.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.744
No. No.
I'm into old...

02:47.834 --> 02:49.165
Didn't come out
right, did it?

02:49.252 --> 02:53.165
No. No. Look, well,
we got a DJ, and you
really haven't lived

02:53.256 --> 02:55.668
until you've seen me
dance to Hips Don't Lie.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.715
Well, you're on,
old man.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.926
You want to get
a cup of coffee?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.095
l have a meeting.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.813
But you can ask me again.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.355
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

03:12.984 --> 03:14.269
Oh.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.308
You better...
Yeah.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.939
(SIGHING)

03:17.030 --> 03:18.236
Morning!

03:20.951 --> 03:23.408
Hey, it's been
six months.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.406
Six months since what?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.572
Six months
since you said
we would discuss

03:28.667 --> 03:30.658
my promotion
in six months.

03:31.086 --> 03:34.578
Jo, there's no
official position
between yours and mine.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.962
Great.
I'll take yours.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.082
No. Today
you're not going
to bother me.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.296
Today is a great day
for Jack Carter.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.420
Zoe has no idea about
her surprise party,

03:42.431 --> 03:44.922
and l have a rain check
for a coffee date.

03:44.975 --> 03:48.934
You said, you'd make
a call to DC for
special consideration.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.933
But you're not very good
at doing things that you
don't really want to do.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.933
I'll tell you what,
because everything's
going so well for me

03:56.027 --> 04:00.111
and because I'm such
an amazing guy, lwill
make the call right now.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.949
(THUNDER CLAPPING)

04:04.995 --> 04:05.984
Oh.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.571
Hello?

04:12.169 --> 04:13.158
Oh.

04:13.879 --> 04:17.292
Maybe it's a sign.
I think the gods
are angry with you.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.625
And what makes you
think that they're
not angry at you?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.919
Oh, because
I'm an amazing guy.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.264
ABBY: Jack?

04:28.685 --> 04:29.800
Abby?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.228
What are you doing here?

04:34.483 --> 04:37.441
Well, that's a nice way
to welcome your ex-wife.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.435
You could have
given me a heads up.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.560
It's her 16th birthday.
You could have
given me an invitation.

05:21.613 --> 05:22.898
(CARTER LAUGHING)

05:23.156 --> 05:24.316
Thank you, Sheriff Lupo.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.318
lt's Deputy.
Deputy.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.155
Until your husband
chooses to promote me.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.407
Ex. And I said
I'd make the call.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.873
Jack doesn't like doing things
Jack doesn't want to do.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.534
(PHONE RINGING)
Tell me about it.
Phones are back.

05:40.715 --> 05:41.750
JO: Lupo.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.915
You look good, Jack.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.048
Does she know
you're coming?

05:44.094 --> 05:45.709
"You look
good, too, Abby."

05:45.762 --> 05:46.968
Come on.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.755
You do. It's just...

05:50.809 --> 05:51.889
You hate surprises.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.721
Yeah, well, especially
when I don't know
they're coming.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.977
Yeah, well, look, Jack,
we had an agreement
and it's been a year.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.725
| just assumed
we'd talk about it again.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.059
Okay, fine.
Let's talk.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.142
Deputy?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.689
Rub it in.
There's been an
accident at the spa.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.772
Oh.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.699
Eureka has a spa?

06:09.995 --> 06:12.782
Yeah. It's a
fission-powered hot spring.
And it's members only.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.784
There's been
a malfunction.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.448
Can you check it out?

06:16.543 --> 06:19.501
Abby and l are going
to go for a coffee.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.042
Thanks.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.591
Nothing would make
me happier, sir.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.670
TWINS 1: Hey, Sheriff!

06:30.765 --> 06:32.050
Hey, guys.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.136
TWINS 2: Morning, Sheriff.
Morning.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.722
Well, did you...
Did you see them?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.352
Just like clones.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.192
Very similar.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.272
And why is it only
raining over there?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.450
Pacific Northwest.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.662
Look, Zoe loves it here.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.206
I mean,
she couldn't be happier.
She's really thriving.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.242
And I think
it's the best thing
we could have done for her.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.704
Are you sure that
that's her perception
and not yours?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.497
Oh, don't do that.
What?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.666
The shrink thing you do
where you make,

07:07.719 --> 07:09.675
you know, you sound like
you're the better parent.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.428
It's called insecurity
and it stems from
the person listening,

07:12.515 --> 07:14.597
not the person
speaking.
What...

07:14.684 --> 07:17.266
And remind me again
why I used to think it was
fun to fight with you?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.686
Because you like
a challenge.
Uh-huh.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.517
With these unstable
pressure systems,

07:21.566 --> 07:24.228
[predict a whopper
of a storm is coming
our way.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.518
I’m Pete Puh/man
for Storm Watch.

07:26.613 --> 07:30.197
So, I thought
I'd stay a week and
we'd have the party

07:30.283 --> 07:32.365
and we'd still have
a couple of days
before Zoe and I go...

07:32.452 --> 07:36.695
My special double-yolk
quail-egg omelet
with Estonian caviar

07:36.748 --> 07:39.114
and basil grafted
from an Italian monastery.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.244
Thanks, Vince.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.999
Oh, my God,
is that truffle oil?

07:42.087 --> 07:44.999
Yes! Finally,
a refined palette.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.415
The last time
I served it to him,
he asked for ketchup.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.041
On the house.
Oh...

07:50.095 --> 07:52.006
Except for the muffin.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.221
Abby, let's talk.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.342
Look at those two. Wow.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.851
Oh, now,
| just feel sick.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.603
Hey, what a surprise!

08:02.649 --> 08:04.640
I hate surprises.
Meeting, huh?

08:04.776 --> 08:06.107
(CHUCKLING)
Brunettes, huh?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.768
l was just telling Jack
what a striking couple
you are.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.112
Well, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
And you are...

08:11.199 --> 08:14.316
Oh, Jack's
evil ex-wife,
Dr. Abby Carter.

08:14.786 --> 08:15.775
Oh.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.861
Dr. Allison Blake.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.950
Dr. Nathan Stark.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.625
Wow. All these doctors.
Your worst
nightmare, Jack.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.670
He used to hate it
when I dragged him around
to my alumni functions.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.792
He called it
"death by dull."

08:28.925 --> 08:30.426
He is very clever.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.671
(ABBY LAUGHING)

08:33.304 --> 08:35.681
So, will you be staying
at the house?

08:37.434 --> 08:40.426
(STUTTERING)
We're setting her up
at Beverly's.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.814
Well, then I guess
I'll see you
at Zoe's party.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.934
I hear there'll
be dancing.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.652
Jack and I won
a Macarena contest
in Cabo once.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.770
Do you remember
that, Jack?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.320
I can't wait
for the party.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.621
You may think you've put
the past behind you,

09:02.625 --> 09:04.035
but these things take time.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.046
The heart doesn't
heal overnight.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.620
Nor should it.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.841
That's why it's important
to find constructive ways
to work through the pain.

09:12.927 --> 09:17.387
Which is precisely
why I want to continue
Kim's research.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.430
Is that the only reason?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.261
Does it matter?

09:21.311 --> 09:24.803
When you're asking to work
at the most advanced research
facility on the planet,

09:24.856 --> 09:26.938
I'm afraid
it does matter.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.018
And does everybody
at G.D. fall under
this level of scrutiny?

09:31.112 --> 09:33.774
Of course.
lncluding Kim.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.023
Were you seeing Kim?

09:37.535 --> 09:38.991
On and off.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.244
More during the months
leading up to her...

09:41.414 --> 09:42.790
To the accident.

09:43.833 --> 09:44.822
Huh.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.991
But she never talked
about her research?

09:47.045 --> 09:50.583
Up to a point.
My security level doesn't
cover Section Five projects,

09:50.673 --> 09:52.880
but she told me
what she could.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.796
So you never
visited her lab?

09:57.555 --> 09:58.590
No.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.677
Right.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.350
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

10:04.437 --> 10:05.552
Oh. Sorry.

10:05.647 --> 10:09.014
Go ahead. We're done.
Same time tomorrow?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.270
Absolutely. Yeah?

10:15.657 --> 10:16.988
Hot, yeah?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.819
Yeah, so I've noticed.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.243
It's crazy.
I come to turn on
the nuclear bubbles,

10:22.413 --> 10:24.074
and look what I see.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.990
What is...
What is this?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.665
My first big case.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.881
ABBY: So is Zoe
excited at all?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.921
Yeah. Yeah, sure,
I guess.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.301
You guess.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.463
Abby, we should talk.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.048
Oh, God, Jack.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.132
Well, I never thought
it was settled.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.058
You didn't tell her.
I assumed we were
gonna talk about it.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.352
We had an agreement...
That was before.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.814
Before what?

10:49.065 --> 10:52.478
(STAMMERING)
Before probably the
greatest year of my life.

10:54.028 --> 10:57.236
And when were
you planning on
sharing this with me?

10:57.782 --> 11:01.320
I don't know.
The next time you called.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.402
ldidn't plan on
you just showing up.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.412
Oh, God, Jack,
you've had a year.
I mean, this is just like you.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.789
ABBY: This is
so unfair. And it's...

11:10.461 --> 11:11.587
lt's snowing.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.259
What is it
with this place?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.588
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
l... Hold on.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.766
Yeah, Jo, it's not
a good time right now.
It's

11:27.562 --> 11:28.551
snowing.

11:29.898 --> 11:30.933
What?

11:31.566 --> 11:33.431
Did you call Henry?

11:34.068 --> 11:37.731
Okay. I'll be there
as soon as | get
Abby settled. Thanks.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.317
Abby is not settling
this time, Jack.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.079
JO: We didn't close down
the entire spa.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.914
No reason to cause
a panic.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.624
I've got sciatica,
and no one's ever told
me about this place?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.416
It's on G.D. property,
Carter.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.586
You guys don't
belong here.
Employees only.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.800
We're here on
official business.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.598
The grotto closure.
Yeah. Inconvenient.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.766
At least Alma's still
giving shiatsu.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.765
You have shiatsu?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.771
(GROANING)

12:13.942 --> 12:15.682
JO: Carter, up this way.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.438
Is that embroidered?

12:17.528 --> 12:19.735
Membership has
its privileges.

12:22.617 --> 12:26.109
You mean those brainiacs
use a nuclear reactor
to heat their whirlpools?

12:26.162 --> 12:30.030
Not the reactor,
just the by-product of
the core cooling system.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.449
Oh.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.041
This is
a by-product of
a cooling system?

12:37.131 --> 12:39.622
Flash freezing?
Not likely.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.833
Well, we better get an ID.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.275
Okay. Which piece
do we start with?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.404
Still think these
nuclear hot tubs
are safe?

13:07.912 --> 13:09.698
You know, temperatures
would have had
to have dropped to

13:09.789 --> 13:12.906
minus 460 degrees
Fahrenheit like that.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.951
Yeah, but you see what
happens when they change
the natural order of things?

13:16.045 --> 13:18.536
I mean, everything's under
control and then somebody
throws a wrench

13:18.589 --> 13:21.376
in something that's working
perfectly fine for
their own selfish reasons,

13:21.426 --> 13:24.213
and then your life
is shattered and
she's blaming you.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.544
What?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.629
Are we still talking
about the reactor?

13:27.724 --> 13:29.555
Yeah.
What?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.182
Okay. So how are we
going to get an ID now?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.261
We just look for a finger.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.930
Finger.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.524
How about a thumb?

13:44.699 --> 13:46.530
You sure that's a thumb?

13:46.576 --> 13:48.783
Well, only if
it has a print.

14:06.804 --> 14:11.468
"Baxter, Neil.
G.D. employee
number 18-56-27."

14:12.060 --> 14:13.641
It's a thumb.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.260
ALLISON: I can't
explain the death.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.937
Scientifically, the reactor
just doesn't make sense.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.482
I mean, ifthe hot springs
had boiled, I'd say, you know,
maybe there was a leak.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.647
Well, Henry mentioned
something about
the cooling system.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.271
Which doesn't go
below 20 degrees,
skiing weather.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.607
Okay. So like
the snow at Beverly's?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.441
I don't know, Carter.
Why don't you look into it?

14:30.495 --> 14:31.951
Unless you're too busy
with personal matters.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Did I miss something?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.791
| just want to
get this figured out
as quickly as possible.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.960
Oh, my God,
you're jealous.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.457
Of?

14:42.548 --> 14:43.833
What do you think?

14:43.966 --> 14:45.467
Oh, please.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.132
Come on.
You have nothing
to worry about.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.297
I'm not worried.
You know what?

14:49.347 --> 14:51.303
Let's just stay
focused on work,

14:51.391 --> 14:54.007
so we can avoid
these awkward moments.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.353

are the only social life

(SIGHING)

15:03.194 --> 15:06.311
Check this out.
This was Baxter,
the frozen guy's lab.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.647
I've been filling in
sometimes.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.412
Baxter was conducting
a real-time field study
on the mating habits

15:13.496 --> 15:15.862
of a tribe in Tanzania.
You see those two?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.620
That's Danny and Sandy.
They've been together
since they were teenagers.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.500
How about the jumpy one?

15:21.546 --> 15:25.004
Tom. He's been like that
since he hooked up with Katie.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.171
Exactly how much
time have you spent
down here, Fargo?

15:30.680 --> 15:33.797
Baxter put up
a live webcast every day
to poll viewer reaction

15:33.850 --> 15:35.886
to the relationship dynamics.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.600
Better than The Bachelor.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.018
Was he working
with anyone else?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.142
lwouldn't call it working.

15:42.316 --> 15:46.150
He was known to do
a lot of field testing
with the female lab techs,

15:46.195 --> 15:48.151
if you know what I mean.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.104
Gave new meaning
to the term
"wild monkey."

15:50.158 --> 15:51.819
Please stop that.
Okay.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.783
CARTER: Total mystery to me.
I'm scared, Henry.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.407
In three days,
Zoe turns 16.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.668
And any man who says
he understands women is
either naive or a liar.

16:45.755 --> 16:46.790
(SIGHS)

16:46.839 --> 16:49.922
Well, apparently Baxter did.
He was the Casanova
of Section Three.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.425
l've questioned six women
who thought he was
God's gift to their gender,

16:53.471 --> 16:55.336
even when there
wasn't enough of him
to go around.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.671
Well, there
certainly is now.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.757
Yeah.
What did Allison say?

16:58.809 --> 17:00.424
She doesn't think
it was the reactor.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.718
Yeah, she's right.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.224
The cooling system
could not possibly create
a temperature that low

17:04.315 --> 17:05.805
to freeze tissue that fast,

17:05.858 --> 17:08.474
unless we were into
China Syndrome times five.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.484
Yeah, well, I have Jo
retracing his last day.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.278
It's going to take me
a little time to get you
an accurate time of death.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.319
l have to wait
for this tissue to thaw.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.697
Yeah. Or we could
just read his watch.

Twenty-six.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.449

that smart about women...

what time is it?

Mmm-hmm.

17:31.801 --> 17:32.790

next to Mercury?

what's going on?

an agreement when
you came to live here.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.711

you were supposed to
come back to LA with me,

supposed to tell her.

22:17.294 --> 22:21.583
PETE: They all began with
a severe temperature drop last
night over the hot springs,

22:21.632 --> 22:25.420
which precipitated
a chain reaction of
unstable pressure systems.

The rain downtown,
the snow on the north side,
the dust storm, all...

22:29.014 --> 22:32.757
Yeah. All caused
by the initial drop
in pressure. Now, watch.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.138
PETE: The pressure drop
began here,

22:35.271 --> 22:37.478
and by the time
it hit the hot springs,
insta-freeze.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.811
So the freaky weather
didn't cause the freeze,

22:41.861 --> 22:43.977
the freeze caused
the freaky weather.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.444
Exactly.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.543
I know.
I appreciate you coming.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.296
I'm always happy
to come to the office
for a session.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.836
Actually, I didn't
call you here for me.
It's Henry.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.388
I need him cleared
to work at G.D.

23:13.976 --> 23:14.965
Oh.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.310
Well, our sessions
are going well.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.433
I think maybe in
another few weeks.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.894
I'm afraid
I can't wait that long.

23:23.277 --> 23:26.815
Henry's in a fragile
state of mind, Allison.
He's not ready.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.319
I'd like to help you out,
but I have to put him first.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.822
I'm afraid
in good conscience
I can't sign off on this.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.457
All right. Then
I'll do it myself.

24:17.831 --> 24:21.073
Henry Deacon is being
cleared to return to Global.

24:21.460 --> 24:25.248
I know. I'm coming in
for a debriefing.
We need to strategize.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.250
Jo? I sent you
a picture of a map.
JO: Got it.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.713
Need you to check out
what's there.
Did it.

24:32.763 --> 24:34.378
I think it's
a pretty good lead.
Good lead. I know.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.135
So if you'll let me do
my job for a change.
Emphasis on change.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.887
Jo, l have enough women
who are mad at me today.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.559
I found a cabin.

24:40.813 --> 24:41.928
What? Where?

24:41.981 --> 24:45.269
Right smack dab in the
middle, and it's owned
by Dr. Steven Whiticus,

24:45.317 --> 24:49.811
and you'll never guess who
was the last person to call
Baxter the night he died.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.736
Steven Whiticus.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.074
JO: Well, no,
his wife Wendy.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.952
Baxter was field-testing
the wife?

24:59.164 --> 25:02.577
Maybe the husband
found out, and, you know,
crime of passion.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.408
(DOOR OPENING)
Okay, I'll check out
the cabin.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.492
You check out the doctor.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.168
She's gone, Jack.
She ran away.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.249
What?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.546
It's just like before.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.462
All right, did she take
anything with her?

25:12.469 --> 25:15.461
No, she just...
She left the house
by herself.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.972
Well, she does that
all the time.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.509
I mean, she's not gone,
Abby. She's 16.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.976
Yeah, but how do
you know for sure?

25:22.980 --> 25:25.221
Because I do.
I know her.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.226
She wouldn't run away.
Not like that. Not anymore.

25:27.317 --> 25:30.309
Oh, so I'm the only parent
that she runs away from.
Is that what you're saying?

25:30.404 --> 25:33.988
I'm not saying that.
What I am saying is that
things have changed.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.866
You haven't changed, Jack.
You've always put
your work before us.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.656
That's why she
started running away
to begin with.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.745
Okay.

25:43.876 --> 25:44.865
Let's go.

so if you want to talk,
you have to come with me.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.922
See? Change.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.466
Yeah. I'll call you
from Whiticus' cabin.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.180
She's still not answering.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.345
(SIGHS)
That's because
she's still pissed.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.354
And whose fault is that?

26:08.650 --> 26:10.686
Oh, well, mine obviously.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.315
Because everything bad that
happens would be my fault.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.780
Oh, well, lwouldn't say
everything bad.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.402

Yeah, you're right.
I was wrong. I...

26:34.051 --> 26:35.632
What did she say?

26:37.137 --> 26:38.468
She's fine.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.808
She never wants to talk
to either one of us again,
but she's fine.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.639
She's spending the night
at a friend of hers, Pilar's.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.350

Good influence.
I think you'd like her.

alive last night?

are so complicated.

He's a brilliant man.

It's just that

27:30.983 --> 27:34.475
Neil gave me something
I haven't had for so long.

so powerful.

together last night?

At the cabin
until about midnight.

to the hot springs.

to soak after...

get a hold of you. I found
something in his basement.

using some kind of
microwave technology.

the schematics.
Yeah.

down here is any indication

to see out there,

were having an affair,

calibration problems that
I was working to fix.

to my accident.

it wouldn't have happened.

My Cumulator technology
is very precise.

not Neil Baxter.

my forecast,

35:17.365 --> 35:18.775
maybe it could have
been prevented.

been prevented,

in the grotto.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.413
You think that's
what caused all this?

35:31.463 --> 35:32.828
Pretty sure.

35:35.425 --> 35:36.961
I warned him.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.126
I warned him that
it was reckless
to continue his research.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.010
Honestly, that thing
should be destroyed.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.474
That would be
a relief to you, huh?

35:45.935 --> 35:47.095
Why would I...

35:47.145 --> 35:48.430
Well, ifWhiticus could
control the weather,

35:48.521 --> 35:50.773
then there's not much need
for a weatherman, is there?

35:51.941 --> 35:54.603
I had nothing...
You started the storms,
so you could be a hero,

35:54.653 --> 35:57.019
and Whiticus' research
could be shut down
once and for all.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.102
But you can't prove that.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.780
Actually, I can.
We found footprints
by the dish.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.941
Odd thing, though,
there was no tread.

36:03.036 --> 36:06.620
Now, who would wear
dress shoes to tramp around
in the woods after midnight?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.329
CARTER: Huh, Pete?

36:13.338 --> 36:16.876
Now, why don't you save us
the trouble of matching
our prints to your shoes

36:17.008 --> 36:19.044
and help us
stop this thing.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.880
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

36:26.184 --> 36:27.515
No, I never...

36:29.437 --> 36:31.894
(STAMMERING) I never
meant to hurt anyone.

36:33.608 --> 36:37.021
I mean, I didn't even know
that Wendy and Baxter
were out there.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.863
I'm not a killer, Sheriff.
I'm just...

36:44.035 --> 36:48.574
I'm so tired of no one
taking me seriously
as a scientist in this town.

36:49.249 --> 36:52.662
I mean, it works.
My technology
is the vanguard.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.251
Well, it won't matter
if the storm
wipes out the town.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.169
And we only have
a few hours to save it.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.249
(ALARM BEEPING)

37:00.343 --> 37:02.379
Yeah. Make that one hour.

37:04.764 --> 37:07.221
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

37:08.226 --> 37:10.558
STEVEN: It's been building
since last night.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.103
It is an incredibly
dangerous confluence
of meteorological events.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.055
Perfect storm.
CARTER: Thank you.

37:16.109 --> 37:19.192
A spinning cyclone
of instability high up
in the cryosphere.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.272
Ice funnel of death.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.740
Gotcha. Why don't
you people just say
ice funnel of death?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.738
How is this happening
so far from the ocean?

37:24.784 --> 37:27.446
Lake Archimedes.
Because of all the
volatility in the area,

37:27.537 --> 37:30.950
it's providing enough cold
moisture for the storm to
brew, and it's happening fast.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.496
This is tomorrow.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.619
And there's
no way to stop it?

37:33.710 --> 37:36.372
Well, warm tropical
currents could counteract
an event like this,

37:36.463 --> 37:38.294
but we're nowhere
near an El Nino.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.666
All right, we might have
to evacuate the town.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.674
No. There's no time.
We might end up with
a bunch more frozen Baxters.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.630
Look, all we need
is warm water, right?

37:48.725 --> 37:51.592
Theoretically it could,
but it doesn't have
the range.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.802
Presumably, it's attached
to a mainframe somewhere
in the cabin.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.388
Yeah. It's attached
underneath the house.
It heats the house.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.064
It's an
environmentally
conscious design.

37:58.151 --> 38:00.563
Well, that's it. The lake
is the water source for
the hot springs, right?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.523
Linked to the reactor
by an underground aquifer.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.647
So you crank up
thejuice at G.D.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.198
and we build some steam.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.652
CARTER: I'm going
to need a coat.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.071
(SIREN BLARING)

38:16.044 --> 38:17.500
Hey, how's it looking
on your end?

38:17.545 --> 38:20.127
ALLISON: We're at
850 degrees Celsius.
Are you there yet?

38:20.632 --> 38:22.873
Yeah, but not for long.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.835
STEVEN: Inside the main
control panel of the dish
array is an override switch.

38:26.888 --> 38:30.176
You need to manually aim
the dish directly at the lake

38:30.308 --> 38:32.014
to get it to
flash boil the water.

38:32.060 --> 38:35.678
STEVEN: If it evaporates
too slowly, we only
strengthen the hurricane.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.350
So, no pressure.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.486
The timing
is critical. You need
to activate the dish

38:49.536 --> 38:53.529
when we reach
1,000 degrees Celsius
to hit the flash-boil point.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.495
I found the override!
Where do I aim it?

39:01.548 --> 39:04.335
You need to dial it
60 degrees to the northeast.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.849
ALLISON: We're at 975 degrees.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.306
Got it!

39:17.355 --> 39:18.390
(GRUNTING)

39:18.481 --> 39:19.470
(YELLING)

39:19.983 --> 39:21.519
Almost there. Ready?

39:21.609 --> 39:22.689
Hang on!

39:22.861 --> 39:25.022
We're at 1,000 degrees.
You have to do it now!

39:25.113 --> 39:26.523
I'm trying!

39:26.865 --> 39:28.230
(GRUNTING)

39:29.367 --> 39:30.777
How hard is it
to push a button?

39:32.287 --> 39:33.527
You want to do it?

39:33.621 --> 39:34.610
Carter!

39:45.383 --> 39:48.671
(WATER BUBBLING)

39:52.932 --> 39:55.218
We did it.
Carter, are you okay?

39:55.351 --> 39:57.091
(PANTING)

39:57.186 --> 39:59.438
ALLISON: Carter?
Say something.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.138
I want a raise.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.907
Like, they think this
is a solution, bouncing
me back and forth.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.823
Well, who would you choose?
I mean, if you had to.

40:15.872 --> 40:16.861
Your mom or your dad?

40:17.874 --> 40:21.787
Well, ifthey loved me,
they wouldn't make me,
but...

40:21.878 --> 40:25.370
Right now, I'm just
so mad at my dad
for lying to me.

40:25.465 --> 40:28.332
Well, you know,
sometimes people have
good reasons for lying.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.501
There is no good reason
for lying.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.012
ALL: Surprise!

40:36.351 --> 40:38.467
(ALL APPLAUDING)

40:40.813 --> 40:42.428
I hate surprises.

40:47.195 --> 40:50.403
(SLOW DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

40:59.582 --> 41:01.197
Any job offers?

41:02.377 --> 41:03.537
A few.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.960
I heard 17.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.963
It would be crass to count.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.709
Just so you know,
I traced the e-mail
on KB-201.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.843
I know you sent it.

41:19.936 --> 41:22.518
I just wanted
what was best
for Kevin.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.601
Give me one second.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.857
Henry, I've arranged
for everything to be
unsealed tomorrow.

41:35.952 --> 41:38.785
Kim's Section Five records,
all of her data.

41:38.830 --> 41:42.197
Oh, thanks.
It means a lot to me.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.783
Me, too.
Thank you.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.788
CARTER: Has she said
anything to you?

41:46.879 --> 41:48.289
ABBY: Not a word.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.132
(SCOFFING)
I knew it.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.002
It really is a nice party.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.383
Yeah. I'm glad
she's having fun.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.300
NATHAN: Mr. and Mrs. Macarena.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.348
Oh, I really hate him.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.767
So, what do we do now?

42:07.900 --> 42:09.856
What do you want to do?

42:12.363 --> 42:13.864
I don't know.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.692
Well, then Zoe and I
will go back to LA and...

42:19.120 --> 42:22.783
And when you do,
you'll know
where to find us.
