Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:01.738 --> 00:03.924
- Jake said he loved me.
- You left Jake hanging?

00:04.037 --> 00:05.124
You know what
her response to me was?

00:05.125 --> 00:06.426
- "Awesome."
- Ooh.

00:06.427 --> 00:08.360
We know you were
in love with Matty.

00:08.361 --> 00:09.828
- But when did you know?
- After we had sex.

00:09.829 --> 00:12.650
Okay, you have to have sex with Jake.
Then you'll know.

00:12.759 --> 00:15.326
It will be worth the wait.
I promise.

00:16.001 --> 00:18.370
From an early age,
I'd been programmed

00:18.371 --> 00:19.738
to dream about my wedding--

00:19.739 --> 00:20.872
What I would be wearing,

00:20.873 --> 00:22.974
who I would be marrying, and...

00:22.975 --> 00:24.975
What kind of debt
I'd be inheriting.

00:24.976 --> 00:26.744
'Cause, let's face it,
the matrimonial business

00:26.745 --> 00:28.145
was a racket,

00:28.146 --> 00:30.514
and my mother was a sucker
for a good party.

00:30.515 --> 00:33.417
I'd be paying that shit off
till I died.

00:33.418 --> 00:36.754
But it would be worth it,
because the day would be...

00:36.755 --> 00:38.989
Crap! I forgot my cutlets!

00:38.990 --> 00:40.423
Considering Ally's past,

00:40.424 --> 00:42.525
I never expected her to be
a traditional bride.

00:42.526 --> 00:43.960
Found 'em.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.262
She was more
the drive-thru chapel type.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.665
How much you wanna bet her
dress is gonna have cutouts?

00:48.666 --> 00:50.467
20 bucks.

00:50.468 --> 00:51.735
50.

00:51.736 --> 00:53.703
It's not gonna be obscene.

00:53.704 --> 00:55.772
It's gonna be spandex.

01:07.283 --> 01:08.350
You look stunning.

01:08.351 --> 01:10.085
And you will too.

01:10.086 --> 01:12.953
Because...

01:12.954 --> 01:15.490
I bought you all your dresses.

01:15.491 --> 01:16.624
I love it.

01:16.625 --> 01:18.726
I'm not gonna throw up.

01:18.727 --> 01:20.294
You did a good job, Al.

01:20.295 --> 01:21.996
Ally had really
turned a corner.

01:21.997 --> 01:23.798
She suddenly had style, class,

01:23.799 --> 01:25.032
and generous spirit.

01:25.033 --> 01:27.034
I had your dress
specially made.

01:27.035 --> 01:29.903
I guess people really could
escape their past.

01:31.906 --> 01:33.874
What? You're not
a bridesmaid.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.241
You're the flower bitch.

01:35.242 --> 01:37.711
But clearly,
I couldn't escape mine.

01:44.051 --> 01:46.051
There has got to be
a way to tone this down.

01:46.052 --> 01:48.921
- Suggestions?
- Put on a hat.

01:48.922 --> 01:50.656
- What's that gonna do?
- Hide your face.

01:50.657 --> 01:51.957
Okay, look at the bright side.

01:51.958 --> 01:53.459
You're in a wedding.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.061
It's gonna have full booze bars
and dirty old men

01:56.062 --> 01:58.130
- to sneak you drinks.
- Nobody's getting me a drink

01:58.131 --> 01:59.131
looking like
a five-year-old.

01:59.132 --> 02:00.665
Every family has a perv.

02:00.666 --> 02:02.033
And, knowing Ally,

02:02.034 --> 02:03.902
her family would
have more than one.

02:03.903 --> 02:06.438
So my mom's crashing
at the hotel,

02:06.439 --> 02:08.406
which means tonight
is gonna be the night.

02:08.407 --> 02:11.208
- Project bone is in effect?
- Yep.

02:11.209 --> 02:12.944
With my lifetime
supply of protection...

02:12.945 --> 02:14.278
I'm ready.

02:14.279 --> 02:16.013
But maybe we won't do it here.

02:16.014 --> 02:17.614
I should prepare
for spontaneity.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.450
Where am I gonna put these?

02:19.451 --> 02:20.584
Mom, I need a purse.

02:20.585 --> 02:22.820
Look at the ones on my bed.

02:22.821 --> 02:25.388
Your bad tan lines are lifting.

02:25.389 --> 02:27.090
I knew that moron at the salon

02:27.091 --> 02:28.358
used the wrong skin toner.

02:28.359 --> 02:30.461
Lil' bitch,
get me my sippy cup.

02:30.462 --> 02:31.562
Sippy cup?

02:31.563 --> 02:34.564
I need my juice!

02:34.565 --> 02:35.998
And a cheeseburger.

02:35.999 --> 02:38.300
Ally had been on a cleanse
for over a month,

02:38.301 --> 02:40.269
which had taken her from
bridezilla

02:40.270 --> 02:41.403
to bridesaster.

02:44.475 --> 02:45.708
I'm getting nervous.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.910
- Why?
- It's my big day.

02:47.911 --> 02:49.811
Well, I'm hoping
that the wedding

02:49.812 --> 02:52.146
will rekindle something
with Kevin,

02:52.147 --> 02:54.850
which is why I got a room
for the night.

02:54.851 --> 02:56.985
He is a sucker for hotel sex.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.389
Lace, put the fan down.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.359
Kevin's not coming.
He RSVP'd with regrets.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.961
Regrets?
What kind of regrets.

03:06.962 --> 03:09.497
The wedding kind.
Frickin' relax.

03:09.498 --> 03:11.966
'Cause guess who's single, hot,

03:11.967 --> 03:15.068
and still hung up on you.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.436
Ben's coming.

03:16.437 --> 03:17.571
My Ben?

03:17.572 --> 03:18.873
Who's Ben?

03:18.874 --> 03:20.407
Did she just say "my Ben"?

03:20.408 --> 03:21.674
Mom, why is he your Ben?

03:21.675 --> 03:24.844
Damn... I haven't seen him
in like--

03:24.845 --> 03:27.146
- 15 years.
- Yeah!

03:27.147 --> 03:30.617
Not since after--
after Jenna was born.

03:30.618 --> 03:32.785
Is he still funny?

03:32.786 --> 03:34.821
Ohh. Funnier.

03:34.822 --> 03:36.022
With my dad out of the picture

03:36.023 --> 03:37.856
and my mom
in a vulnerable place,

03:37.857 --> 03:39.225
suddenly a hotel room
out of my sight

03:39.226 --> 03:40.659
didn't seem like a good idea.

03:40.660 --> 03:43.229
I needed some clarity
on the Ben sitch.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.531
Mom, answer me.
Who is Ben?

03:45.532 --> 03:47.166
Lil' bitch,
why do you need a purse?

03:47.167 --> 03:48.867
You're supposed to have
a basket-- Where is it?

03:48.868 --> 03:50.569
Don't know.

03:50.570 --> 03:52.771
Emily!

03:52.772 --> 03:55.907
Where's the flower basket?

03:55.908 --> 03:57.409
It's... here.

03:57.410 --> 03:59.511
Let's see, we have
something old,

03:59.512 --> 04:01.913
something new,
something borrowed,

04:01.914 --> 04:03.614
- and blue.
- And-- and basket.

04:03.615 --> 04:05.483
I don't see a basket.

04:05.484 --> 04:07.318
That was on your list!

04:07.319 --> 04:08.753
Don't worry, we're gonna...

04:08.754 --> 04:09.786
Figure this out.

04:09.787 --> 04:11.088
And we'll be right back.

04:12.357 --> 04:15.926
I can't have a wedding
without a basket.

04:19.329 --> 04:20.564
Take this!

04:20.565 --> 04:22.699
See? Big flower bitch.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.268
Big basket!

04:24.269 --> 04:25.601
That is not gonna work!

04:28.705 --> 04:30.506
Mom, who is Ben?

04:30.507 --> 04:33.376
So we have
a little bit of a glitch.

04:33.377 --> 04:36.479
Nothing too major,
but my assistant just quit.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.782
Don't fret, I'm gonna
find someone to help.

04:39.783 --> 04:41.016
I hope.

04:41.017 --> 04:42.417
Tamara can assist you.

04:42.418 --> 04:44.052
What? Why me?

04:44.053 --> 04:46.088
Because I can't get through
this day alone.

04:46.089 --> 04:47.589
I pay cash!

04:47.590 --> 04:48.756
I am your slave.

04:48.757 --> 04:49.958
Ohh.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.193
Whoa.

04:51.194 --> 04:52.894
Everything is under control.

04:52.895 --> 04:54.129
They're gonna get me a basket,

04:54.130 --> 04:55.930
and you don't need to implode.

04:55.931 --> 04:58.065
Implode?

04:58.066 --> 05:00.834
All I asked was for you
to do one thing.

05:00.835 --> 05:02.703
Hold a frickin' basket!

05:02.704 --> 05:04.438
You are ruining my wedding

05:04.439 --> 05:07.608
just like you ruined my life
the day you were born.

05:07.609 --> 05:10.677
Apparently, Ally couldn't
get past the past.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.812
And I was done.

05:11.813 --> 05:13.813
You just lost
your flower bitch.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.482
Good.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.282
Girls, please.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.850
Let's not get crazy.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.619
Okay, we're already there...

05:27.328 --> 05:29.261
Hey, babe. Just borrowing a suit
and I'll be on my way.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.729
Forget the suit.
I quit.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.397
Quit?
What do you mean you quit?

05:32.398 --> 05:34.266
- The wedding.
- There's baskets everywhere!

05:34.267 --> 05:36.001
- We will find--
- I just wanted to marry...

05:36.002 --> 05:38.937
Ally's lost half her body
weight, along with her sanity.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.939
We're gonna do something
fun instead.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.341
My mom's staying at the hotel,

05:42.342 --> 05:44.709
so we've got the place
to ourselves.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.944
Are you suggesting what
I think you're suggesting?

05:46.945 --> 05:48.746
Oh, I don't know.

05:48.747 --> 05:50.848
But if you have a dirty mind,
you'll meet me here around 5:00.

05:50.849 --> 05:52.617
I'll be there at 4:59.

05:54.085 --> 05:55.686
Ally! Ally!

05:55.687 --> 05:57.888
Change of plans, dude.
I don't need a suit.

05:57.889 --> 06:00.158
Good thing,
'cause this might be cursed.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.626
Last time
I wore it was to the formal.

06:02.627 --> 06:05.195
Right... When you got
dissed by that girl

06:05.196 --> 06:06.996
with that other guy--
I forgot about that.

06:06.997 --> 06:08.298
Hey, who was that, anyway?

06:14.605 --> 06:17.073
Courtney?
Don't you wanna get it?

06:17.074 --> 06:18.240
Not with you here.

06:18.241 --> 06:19.542
Uh, oh, hey, it's Matty.

06:19.543 --> 06:20.909
I been thinking
about you all day,

06:20.910 --> 06:22.311
- writing in my diary.
- Hi.

06:22.312 --> 06:25.080
Yeah? Can I call you back?

06:25.081 --> 06:26.182
- Courtney.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

06:26.183 --> 06:27.616
I'll see you tonight.

06:27.617 --> 06:28.750
Dude, really funny.

06:28.751 --> 06:30.919
So what's up
with you two, anyway?

06:30.920 --> 06:32.921
Eh... She's cool.

06:32.922 --> 06:35.823
As in... girlfriend cool?

06:35.824 --> 06:37.525
I'm feeling it out, yeah.

06:37.526 --> 06:39.860
Well, I'm glad you're finally
over that chick from camp.

06:39.861 --> 06:41.896
Yeah, I'm ready to move on.

06:41.897 --> 06:43.331
I can't move on.

06:43.332 --> 06:45.400
Ally's always holding
my birth against me,

06:45.401 --> 06:46.767
like I had some choice
in the matter.

06:46.768 --> 06:49.036
- I hate her.
- Then why are you helping me?

06:49.037 --> 06:50.904
Because I'm a nice person!

06:50.905 --> 06:52.539
Hide it.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.008
Now that I'm out, I don't
want a way back in.

06:55.009 --> 06:56.643
No, you are.

06:56.644 --> 06:59.012
No, you.

06:59.013 --> 07:00.814
Ricky, shut it.
I gotta go.

07:00.815 --> 07:02.048
Where can I get ready?

07:02.049 --> 07:03.584
- By the dumpster.
- That's sweet,

07:03.585 --> 07:06.419
but I don't have time
for a tour of your home.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.287
Guest bath
is through the kitchen.

07:09.923 --> 07:11.390
I can't do this.

07:11.391 --> 07:13.025
I can't work a wedding
while Sadie and Ricky

07:13.026 --> 07:14.427
gnaw on each other.

07:14.428 --> 07:16.495
I'm into porn,
but not the torture kind.

07:16.496 --> 07:18.831
Ricky's with Sadie.
He's the one being tortured.

07:18.832 --> 07:19.965
True.

07:19.966 --> 07:21.799
Ricky has a sadie.

07:22.835 --> 07:24.536
Ben is coming!

07:24.537 --> 07:26.705
My mom has a Ben.
Who the hell is Ben?

07:26.706 --> 07:29.241
He's the guy your mom
should have married.

07:30.976 --> 07:34.112
So far, there were no Bens
in my mom's freshman class.

07:34.113 --> 07:35.714
Maybe he's older?

07:35.715 --> 07:38.215
Jesus, your mom documented
every moment of high school,

07:38.216 --> 07:40.618
like it was the best time
of her life.

07:40.619 --> 07:42.085
It was.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.654
- Sad.
- Sad.

07:44.856 --> 07:48.659
Lode to the mother.
I struck scrunchies.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.461
Ben and my mom
were definitely a couple.

07:50.462 --> 07:53.263
Maybe this is the guy
she slept with before my dad.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.498
Red flag. See his skin?
Oily.

07:55.499 --> 07:57.734
Odds are,
he's now bald and fat.

08:00.103 --> 08:02.639
They went to a costume party?

08:02.640 --> 08:05.040
Something called "kid n play"?

08:05.041 --> 08:06.208
What is that?

08:06.209 --> 08:07.677
Not a threat.

08:07.678 --> 08:09.811
Ben's definitely not gonna
out-hot your pop.

08:09.812 --> 08:12.247
- Kid!
- Play!

08:16.248 --> 08:19.586
- Threat alert.
- T, get me that basket.

08:21.648 --> 08:23.382
You smell so good.

08:23.383 --> 08:24.449
Are you still using...

08:24.450 --> 08:25.850
- Coconut body wash.
- Coconut body wash.

08:25.851 --> 08:27.152
Yeah.

08:28.387 --> 08:29.854
Reunion's over.
Oh, hi.

08:29.855 --> 08:33.024
Looks like you got that
nasty skin condition cleared up.

08:33.025 --> 08:33.857
Jenna!

08:33.859 --> 08:35.727
Ben, I am so sorry.

08:35.727 --> 08:37.696
She is not usually this rude.

08:37.697 --> 08:39.764
Ah, it's okay.
She's spunky.

08:39.765 --> 08:41.332
She takes after her mom.

08:41.332 --> 08:43.600
Sounded like a compliment,

08:43.601 --> 08:46.203
but you should know that
all the good things about me

08:46.204 --> 08:47.871
are directly related to my dad,

08:47.872 --> 08:49.807
who, for the record,
is still married to my mom.

08:49.808 --> 08:52.475
So... What are you doing here?

08:52.476 --> 08:54.678
Uh, Ally wanted me
to give you all a ride

08:54.679 --> 08:55.946
over to the ceremony.

08:55.947 --> 08:57.681
- Oh, did she?
- Yeah, she did.

08:58.916 --> 08:59.916
Good news, mom.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.250
We found the basket.

09:01.251 --> 09:02.551
Back in the wedding!

09:02.552 --> 09:04.754
That is so great, sweetie.

09:05.956 --> 09:07.623
We need to finish
getting ready.

09:07.624 --> 09:10.159
Oh! Well, Ben, why don't
you wait in the living room?

09:10.160 --> 09:12.895
Or the car.

09:12.896 --> 09:16.031
I w-- I will go
wait in the car.

09:16.032 --> 09:17.766
Okay.

09:17.767 --> 09:18.934
Ahem.

09:21.804 --> 09:23.471
What was that?

09:23.472 --> 09:24.773
Was I frazzled?

09:24.774 --> 09:26.674
I felt frazzled.

09:26.675 --> 09:29.377
I haven't seen him in...

09:29.378 --> 09:30.911
- 15 years.
- 15 years.

09:30.912 --> 09:33.214
I forgot how handsome he is.

09:33.215 --> 09:35.315
And those eyes.

09:35.316 --> 09:40.487
What he could make me do
just by looking a--

09:40.488 --> 09:42.623
No wonder I felt frazzled!

09:42.624 --> 09:45.292
I <i>look</i> frazzled!
Why didn't you say something?

09:45.293 --> 09:47.093
Well, it was a little hard
to get a word in edgewise

09:47.094 --> 09:49.796
between his stare
and your drool.

09:49.797 --> 09:50.830
Who is this Ben guy?

09:50.831 --> 09:52.698
He's my ex-boyfriend.

09:52.699 --> 09:54.968
The one who swiped
your V-card?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.636
Well, I wouldn't
put it like that,

09:56.637 --> 09:58.604
but, yes.

09:58.605 --> 10:00.339
Thank God for the girls.

10:00.340 --> 10:01.940
At least they
were in good form.

10:01.941 --> 10:03.642
Shoot! I have to get ready.

10:03.643 --> 10:07.312
Oh, I can't believe he saw me
looking like such a mess!

10:07.313 --> 10:08.313
Ohh!

10:08.314 --> 10:09.915
- This is not good.
- No joke.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.116
Ben's your mom's Matty.

10:11.117 --> 10:12.417
Tamara had connected the dots.

10:12.418 --> 10:14.019
Ben was hot, hovering,
and waiting

10:14.020 --> 10:15.754
to give my mother a ride,
again.

10:15.755 --> 10:17.756
If he was my mom's Matty,
then I was in trouble,

10:17.757 --> 10:19.290
and so was my dad.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.992
Dad, it doesn't matter
what you're doing.

10:20.993 --> 10:22.660
Drop it and call me back.

10:22.661 --> 10:25.696
- It's an--
- Emergency!

10:25.697 --> 10:27.932
My water just broke.

10:27.933 --> 10:29.600
Crap... Balls!

10:29.601 --> 10:31.769
Damn it!
Fuck Me!

10:31.770 --> 10:33.570
Now I have one more thing
to worry about.

10:33.571 --> 10:35.105
You know, Monica's
gonna be fine.

10:35.106 --> 10:36.406
She's on her way
to the hospital.

10:36.407 --> 10:37.908
I'm not talking about Monica.

10:37.909 --> 10:40.877
Now, I have a hole
in my bridal party.

10:40.878 --> 10:42.279
- Jenna can do it!
- No.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.147
Lil' bitch needs
to throw the flowers.

10:44.148 --> 10:46.316
I have to have
one more bridesmaid.

10:46.317 --> 10:49.186
What you have to have
is a detox from the crack pipe.

10:49.187 --> 10:51.921
No one is gonna be available
at the last minute

10:51.922 --> 10:53.355
on a Saturday.

10:53.356 --> 10:54.790
I love it!

10:54.791 --> 10:56.258
It's so blousy.

10:56.259 --> 10:58.627
Now I can hit the ol' buffet
extra hard.

10:58.628 --> 11:00.830
Thank you so much

11:00.831 --> 11:02.198
for doing this.

11:02.199 --> 11:03.199
Ah, of course.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.766
Lacey!

11:07.436 --> 11:09.570
- I need a favor.
- I'm here for you.

11:09.571 --> 11:11.505
My dad isn't here,
but my mom's ex is.

11:11.506 --> 11:13.141
He's still hot for her.

11:13.142 --> 11:14.575
Since my mom's
an emotional hot mess,

11:14.576 --> 11:15.877
I think she might be
an easy target tonight.

11:15.878 --> 11:17.245
Get my drift?

11:17.246 --> 11:18.779
You want me to keep
the dude distracted

11:18.780 --> 11:21.349
so your mom doesn't feel
the need to revisit history.

11:21.350 --> 11:23.783
- Exactly.
- I don't know.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.185
Please?

11:25.186 --> 11:26.220
Ugh.

11:26.221 --> 11:27.520
Let me break it down
for you, J.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.956
I'm in a relationship.

11:28.957 --> 11:31.124
Okay? And in this
bad-ass dress,

11:31.125 --> 11:33.260
I might have a hard time
keeping his paws off me.

11:33.261 --> 11:36.296
God forbid he hit
my sweet spot...

11:36.297 --> 11:37.564
Unh!

11:37.565 --> 11:39.932
I can't guarantee
I can keep Vixen Val

11:39.933 --> 11:41.167
from stepping out on her man.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.369
I will buy you a cat.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.203
Persian?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.272
Feral.
I like to rescue.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.940
Bitch?

11:49.642 --> 11:50.877
It's lil' bitch.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.178
Bitch.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.945
Crazytown 80 pounds
wants us to wear

11:53.946 --> 11:55.347
our hair in double buns.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.082
This is not gonna work for me

11:57.083 --> 11:59.684
and definitely not for you
and your <i>big love</i> hair.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.386
Can you reason with her?

12:01.387 --> 12:04.789
No.
Do what she wants.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.225
As expected, you're useless.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.361
I'll handle it.
You're welcome.

12:11.796 --> 12:13.397
Listen, auntie attitude,

12:13.398 --> 12:15.532
I appreciate
that this is your day,

12:15.533 --> 12:17.201
but I'm at my limit
of concessions.

12:17.202 --> 12:18.802
I'm not gonna succumb to some

12:18.803 --> 12:20.537
fugtastic
figure-skater style

12:20.538 --> 12:21.538
because you--

12:21.539 --> 12:26.110
Because... I... what?

12:27.011 --> 12:28.678
I hate her.

12:28.679 --> 12:30.380
Well, welcome to the club.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.918
Your dad just called
and said there was an emergency.

12:34.919 --> 12:36.653
- What's wrong?
- Ben!

12:36.654 --> 12:38.321
I saw the way
you looked at each other.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.156
Need a reminder
of the vow you took?

12:40.157 --> 12:42.325
Honey, we're old friends.
That's it.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.793
So there's no need
to worry about

12:43.794 --> 12:45.928
how ridiculously hot he is.

12:45.929 --> 12:47.095
Mom!

12:47.096 --> 12:49.264
Ladies, final touches.

12:49.265 --> 12:51.667
And you have a special visitor.

12:54.237 --> 12:57.039
Hey... What are you
doing here?

12:57.040 --> 13:00.207
I, uh, brought Jake my suit.

13:00.208 --> 13:01.142
Yeah.

13:01.143 --> 13:02.310
♪ Follow me around ♪

13:02.311 --> 13:05.012
Uh, he should be on his way.

13:05.013 --> 13:06.881
So the wedding's back on.

13:06.882 --> 13:08.082
It was never off.

13:08.083 --> 13:11.319
I just had a momentary
freak-out.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.054
Well, you look good now.

13:13.055 --> 13:14.588
I look like a cream puff.

13:15.657 --> 13:16.790
Hey, I'm here.

13:16.791 --> 13:17.825
I'm here. Hi.

13:17.826 --> 13:19.125
Hi.

13:19.126 --> 13:20.627
Where can I change?

13:20.628 --> 13:22.062
Uh, there's a room
down the hall.

13:22.063 --> 13:23.129
Great. Thanks, man.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.531
You're the best.

13:24.532 --> 13:27.668
Oh... Have fun tonight
with Courtney.

13:27.669 --> 13:30.503
Do something I would
definitely do, huh?

13:30.504 --> 13:33.372
Then I guess I'm in
for a dull evening.

13:33.373 --> 13:34.941
Hilarious!

13:34.942 --> 13:37.076
♪ You're the only one ♪

13:37.077 --> 13:38.310
Everything good?

13:38.311 --> 13:40.079
Yeah.
Thanks for bringing the suit.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.914
Oh, it's what I do.
I problem solve.

13:41.915 --> 13:44.083
And since the problem
is solved,

13:44.084 --> 13:46.118
I guess I better head out.

13:46.119 --> 13:48.186
♪ All that I want ♪

13:48.187 --> 13:49.688
You guys look good together.

13:49.689 --> 13:51.022
You think so?

13:51.023 --> 13:53.057
Yeah, and I'm really
happy for you.

13:53.058 --> 13:56.060
Even if it does sting a little.

13:57.262 --> 13:59.464
- So how's Courtney?
- Great.

13:59.465 --> 14:00.999
Yeah, she's--
she's great.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Really great.

14:02.001 --> 14:03.701
Thanks for asking.

14:03.702 --> 14:06.904
Matty...

14:06.905 --> 14:09.640
It still stings
a little for me too.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.175
Matty and I finally
had closure.

14:12.176 --> 14:13.777
And while it was bittersweet,

14:13.778 --> 14:16.113
we were rooting for each other.

14:16.114 --> 14:17.515
So what was I worried about
with Ben?

14:17.516 --> 14:19.682
Well, Lacey looks really good.

14:19.683 --> 14:21.183
And she's separated.

14:21.184 --> 14:23.720
I think tonight might be
my chance to make up

14:23.721 --> 14:24.949
for some lost time.

14:26.814 --> 14:28.618
<i>Where is the flower bitch!?</i>

14:31.217 --> 14:33.685
I'm married, bitches!

14:35.988 --> 14:37.922
This is gonna be a long night.

14:37.923 --> 14:39.123
Can I get you
something to drink?

14:39.124 --> 14:40.724
Yes, preferably with some kick.

14:41.893 --> 14:43.994
Oh! Mrs. Hamilton.
Cocktail?

14:43.995 --> 14:45.729
She'll have a soda.

14:47.466 --> 14:49.567
Honey, I do not
need a chaperone.

14:49.568 --> 14:51.702
Mm, but that's the thing--
You do.

14:51.703 --> 14:53.804
If it isn't the beautiful
Hamilton sisters.

14:55.173 --> 14:57.574
Gross. Ben's tactics
were tacky.

14:57.575 --> 14:59.676
But, unfortunately,
so was my mother.

14:59.677 --> 15:01.178
So they were working.

15:01.179 --> 15:03.846
Still the charmer.

15:03.847 --> 15:06.316
Oh! You don't wanna
do something you'll regret.

15:08.118 --> 15:09.686
I need to get out of here.

15:09.687 --> 15:11.820
Emily is so far up my butt,
I could taste her,

15:11.821 --> 15:13.222
and if that wasn't
craptastic enough,

15:13.223 --> 15:14.756
I can't escape Sadie and Ricky!

15:14.757 --> 15:17.726
They've been raping each other's
faces all night.

15:20.697 --> 15:24.066
I'm gonna crack, Jenna.
I am seriously gonna...

15:26.035 --> 15:28.069
Move the wedding cake.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.537
- You owe me.
- And I did.

15:29.538 --> 15:32.574
Tamara had singlehandedly
saved my sanity all day,

15:32.575 --> 15:34.909
and I needed
to return the favor.

15:34.910 --> 15:36.211
If she couldn't
escape her past,

15:36.212 --> 15:39.180
then I would recount it.

15:39.181 --> 15:41.048
Doll face, you are
the most beautiful woman

15:41.049 --> 15:42.583
in this room.

15:42.584 --> 15:43.850
And...

15:43.851 --> 15:46.052
And I love your full lips.

15:46.053 --> 15:48.955
And your full face.

15:48.956 --> 15:50.156
And your full a--

15:50.157 --> 15:51.758
Watch it.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.828
Mind if I steal her
for a second?

15:54.829 --> 15:56.330
Only for a second.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.297
- Heel.
- Can you tone it down?

15:58.298 --> 15:59.565
Tamara's still
a little sensitive

15:59.566 --> 16:01.200
to the Ricky suck-face
sideshow.

16:01.201 --> 16:04.870
Oh, no...
I-I'm so sorry.

16:04.871 --> 16:06.038
I'm not.

16:06.039 --> 16:07.806
You win some, you lose some.

16:07.807 --> 16:09.408
Ricky might want
to be with you now,

16:09.409 --> 16:11.477
but just wait--
He's a cheater and a liar,

16:11.478 --> 16:13.112
and while you might
think you're special,

16:13.113 --> 16:14.346
you're not.

16:14.347 --> 16:17.382
So enjoy the delusion
while it lasts.

16:22.821 --> 16:26.258
You seem uncommonly calm.

16:26.259 --> 16:29.127
I took a muscle relaxer.

16:29.128 --> 16:31.828
Just a muscle relaxer?

16:31.829 --> 16:34.465
Or three.

16:34.466 --> 16:35.532
Al...

16:35.533 --> 16:37.668
It is not too late to back out.

16:37.669 --> 16:39.270
You haven't slept with him yet.

16:39.271 --> 16:42.539
It'll be an easy annulment.

16:42.540 --> 16:44.841
I think you rushed into this.

16:44.842 --> 16:47.443
- I did.
- Why?

16:47.444 --> 16:48.978
So he wouldn't change his mind.

16:48.979 --> 16:52.515
Lace, he's the first man
who's really loved me.

16:52.516 --> 16:55.818
And that's a feeling
that's hard to forget.

16:58.955 --> 17:00.523
I know.

17:07.128 --> 17:09.364
You're on. Ready?

17:09.365 --> 17:12.567
Point me to the target.

17:12.568 --> 17:14.368
Oh, God.
No, I can't do this.

17:14.369 --> 17:16.438
I won't be able
to hold it together.

17:16.439 --> 17:19.106
- I know he's attractive, but--
- He is not my type.

17:19.107 --> 17:20.308
Pretend.

17:20.309 --> 17:21.709
I can pretend
to be many things,

17:21.710 --> 17:23.377
but attracted to a pretty boy?

17:23.377 --> 17:25.579
That is above
the call of duty, J.

17:25.579 --> 17:29.216
I'll just keep your mom
preoccupied instead.

17:29.217 --> 17:32.119
How many girls
have you cheated on?

17:32.120 --> 17:34.487
Define cheating.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.456
Yes.

17:36.457 --> 17:38.191
Okay? Yes.
I've cheated.

17:38.192 --> 17:40.327
On every girl
I've ever been with.

17:40.328 --> 17:41.828
But they were not you.

17:41.829 --> 17:43.930
I love you, doll face.

17:43.931 --> 17:45.865
And only you.

17:48.202 --> 17:50.069
Say it again.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.505
I love you, and only you.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.978
Hey, what's wrong?

17:59.979 --> 18:01.380
What isn't?

18:01.381 --> 18:03.482
I'm destined to be
an unlovable loser

18:03.483 --> 18:05.784
and Sadie can't help
but rub it in my face.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.754
Yeah.
She's out of control.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.989
I'm gonna put an end to this.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.158
- I'm putting an end to this.
- To what?

18:14.159 --> 18:16.260
Your waltz down memory lane.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.729
Just because
my parents are separated

18:17.730 --> 18:20.297
doesn't mean it's open season
on my mom.

18:20.298 --> 18:22.366
I know your type.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.368
You lost out,
and now you want her back.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.236
But it doesn't matter
what you do,

18:26.237 --> 18:28.505
because my mom loves my dad,

18:28.506 --> 18:30.974
- and she wants him back.
- Point taken.

18:30.975 --> 18:32.876
- Good.
- You're right.

18:32.877 --> 18:37.514
I should have fought for
your mom when I had the chance.

18:39.383 --> 18:41.484
But learn from my mistakes.

18:41.485 --> 18:43.318
I mean, if you have
someone special,

18:43.319 --> 18:44.754
don't take it for granted.

18:44.755 --> 18:46.555
And I did have someone special

18:46.556 --> 18:48.691
who I'd been taking
for granted all night.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.557
With the Ben sitch put to bed,

18:50.648 --> 18:53.489
it was finally time to
jump into mine with Jake.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.526
You off the clock?

18:55.527 --> 18:56.827
Not quite, but at this point,

18:56.828 --> 18:58.529
Emily can suck it.

18:58.530 --> 18:59.730
Have you seen Jake?

18:59.731 --> 19:01.698
He's giving it to Sadie for me.

19:01.699 --> 19:03.099
I love that kid.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.868
And I did too.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.504
And it was time to tell him.

19:07.505 --> 19:10.507
Right there, right then.

19:10.508 --> 19:11.742
Come on, please.

19:11.743 --> 19:12.876
Just chill out.

19:12.877 --> 19:14.511
Mind your own business.

19:14.512 --> 19:16.245
You're acting like an idiot.

19:16.246 --> 19:19.248
Hey... Sorry I've been
MIA All day.

19:19.249 --> 19:20.916
I want to make it up to you.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.951
I think it's time
we ditched the reception.

19:22.952 --> 19:25.454
Me? I'm the fool?

19:25.455 --> 19:27.423
Um, sadly, that would be you.

19:27.424 --> 19:31.193
Why don't you go back to your
best friend's sloppy seconds

19:31.194 --> 19:32.327
and leave me alone.

19:32.328 --> 19:34.862
Excuse me?

19:34.863 --> 19:36.731
Ohh.

19:36.732 --> 19:38.433
You don't know?

19:38.434 --> 19:41.135
You really are the fool.

19:43.439 --> 19:45.072
You're a bitch.

19:45.073 --> 19:47.874
And I don't believe
a thing you're saying.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.176
Ask Matty.

19:49.177 --> 19:51.278
He had a piece of your
Hamilton pie

19:51.279 --> 19:53.814
long before you did.

19:55.183 --> 19:58.218
Go to hell.

20:02.023 --> 20:03.323
Where is she?

20:03.324 --> 20:05.257
She's with another guy.

20:05.258 --> 20:07.794
Glad you're finally getting
over that chick from camp.

20:07.795 --> 20:08.795
Yeah.

Trouble in paradise?

I just have a gut feeling that
that guy's still around.
