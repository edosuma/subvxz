["Right Down the Line"
by Gerry Rafferty playing]

00:39.289 --> 00:40.790
Thanks for doing this.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.214
[Jonah] You okay?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.385
Yeah, I'm just a little, uh, hungover.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.182
There's no one at work to hang out with,
so last night I just

00:57.682 --> 01:01.519
drank a half a bottle of wine by myself
and fell asleep watching crap TV.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.316
You look tired too.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.154
Yeah, I, uh,
had to reconcile the profit and loss

01:11.237 --> 01:15.158
for 11 Panamanian accounts
before business opened today.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.245
And then I had to do
my humanities homework.

Twenty-thousand.

02:43.913 --> 02:44.914
Thank you.

02:46.791 --> 02:47.792
Really.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.464
[engine turns over]

03:21.534 --> 03:23.369
You can't stay silent forever.

03:29.542 --> 03:33.254
I just don't understand it.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.342
If we keep Camilla close,
if we keep her engaged,

03:37.425 --> 03:40.220
it-- it makes it harder
for her to make another move.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.018
How am I supposed to funnel shipments
to the FBI right from under her nose?

03:47.101 --> 03:48.311
You did it with Javi.

03:48.394 --> 03:52.190
Yes, I did. Barely. It is not sustainable.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.486
We tell Navarro what she did,
she goes away.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.947
Uh, when the time is right.

go clean up that hand, take a shower?

04:06.537 --> 04:08.998
-[sighs]
-And I'll-- I'll call Jim.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.502
I'll get him to start working on dropping
today's charges.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.216
[Marty chuckling]

04:20.969 --> 04:23.221
I-I don't know what that was.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.306
I'm pretty sure what it was.

04:26.140 --> 04:26.975
Yeah?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.311
I know I'm not easy to love.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.861
That's not true.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.488
[sighs] We are so close.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.285
And when this is over,

04:46.244 --> 04:47.745
when we get outta here…

04:51.291 --> 04:53.334
if you wanted to leave, I'd understand.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.046
[Marty exhales]

04:59.549 --> 05:01.134
-Is that what you want?
-No.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.432
But I would understand if you did.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.698
-[shudders]
-[sighs]

05:27.160 --> 05:28.870
[Mel] I told you
when we first started this

05:28.953 --> 05:31.539
that I might find some stuff
you don't wanna know.

05:33.541 --> 05:34.959
Well, I hate to tell you this,

05:35.043 --> 05:37.045
but I don't think
we're ever gonna find your son.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.298
What do you mean?

05:44.093 --> 05:47.347
The day your daughter left Ben
at the diner in Barlow,

05:47.847 --> 05:49.098
this man showed up.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.771
He's a triggerman
for a Mexican drug cartel.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.690
I don't understand.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.111
[sighs] I believe that--
that he was there for Ben.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.743
[inhales] Why…

06:10.370 --> 06:13.748
Why would Ben be mixed up
with a Mexican drug cartel?

06:15.416 --> 06:16.334
[smacks lips]

06:16.417 --> 06:20.213
Okay, your daughter and her husband,
they were investigated by the FBI

06:20.296 --> 06:21.589
for money laundering.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.884
Of course.

06:26.886 --> 06:27.720
It was her.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.972
Well, I mean,
no charges were ever brought.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.475
Dear God.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.022
If you like, I can bring this information
over to the local authorities.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.609
Well, I'll-- I'll need some time to think.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.611
Of course.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.367
I'm really sorry.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.713
They fucked up your shit,
her shit, and my whole family.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.299
-They don't deserve to get away with it.
-[Charles] Oh, please.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.469
Well, you had me at
"pay back Wendy Byrde."

07:08.553 --> 07:11.389
I will do whatever I can to help you guys.

07:11.889 --> 07:15.476
Including selling you
my share of the Belle.

07:15.560 --> 07:20.398
Oh, with your stake and Darlene's,
we can take control of the whole thing.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.816
[Charles] Please.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.360
-Mmm! Holy shit.
-Yeah, that's good, right?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.319
[laughing]

07:25.403 --> 07:26.821
[Charles] All right.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.781
So… [exhales]

07:28.865 --> 07:30.450
…two ways to go about this.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.870
Easy way is to just put everything
in Ms. Garrison's name,

07:33.953 --> 07:36.372
sell the Missouri Belle to her
and help her run it.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.374
Oh, um, ahem, what's the hard way?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.335
Exactly how bad is your record?

07:41.419 --> 07:43.963
Uh, three felonies, four misdemeanors.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.715
[Charles] Predominantly juvenile?

07:46.799 --> 07:48.134
You know, that's doable.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.388
-What?
-Expunging your record.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.349
I think I know a judge
who might be amenable.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.685
W-what's that gonna cost?

07:57.768 --> 08:00.730
[Charles] No, no, won't work like that.
I can get you the meeting.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.482
I'll put in a persuasive word.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.443
You can donate to certain causes,
if you choose,

08:05.526 --> 08:07.403
but it'll still be up
to the judge to decide.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.741
-Why-- why can't I just pay them off?
-[Charles laughs] Oh, come on, Ruth.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.119
You just inherited a fortune,
and now you're spearheading

08:15.203 --> 08:18.080
a hostile takeover
of Missouri's newest casino.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.416
That's a-- that's a scale of visibility

08:20.500 --> 08:24.045
even the most well-paid judge
isn't gonna be entirely comfortable with.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.004
Well, neither am I.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.881
Hang on a second. Hang on a second.

08:27.381 --> 08:30.009
You saying she's got
a shot at getting clean?

08:30.092 --> 08:33.387
With the right attitude,
a little bit of luck.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.847
You have to do it.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.434
What, you're afraid
to be my partner or something?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.228
No. I mean-- no.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.440
Look, this is life-changing.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.693
A clean record?
People like us don't get that ever.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.863
You gotta try.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.324
I don't know.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.246
I've been in the system somewhere
since I was three years old

08:58.329 --> 09:01.123
crawling around through cat flaps
for my daddy.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.334
Yeah.

09:03.834 --> 09:07.964
The judge is gonna take one look at me
and know exactly what I am.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.091
Ruth, you own half the land in the county.

09:10.174 --> 09:15.304
You operate an almost successful motel.
You are a goddamn redneck success story.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.974
At least try.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.855
The first clean Langmore
in five generations.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.357
[Rachel] Mm-hmm.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.818
[chuckles]

09:30.820 --> 09:31.904
What the fuck?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.739
-[Charles laughs]
-Yes.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.534
-Let's do it.
-All right. Good, I'll set up the meeting.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.785
But here's the thing, okay?

09:37.868 --> 09:39.287
-It's important.
-Mm-hmm.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.455
When you meet Judge Mayhew,

09:41.539 --> 09:45.459
it's "Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am."
You got it, okay?

09:47.211 --> 09:49.589
-You fucking got it, Charlie.
-[laughs] Okay.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.551
[men and women] Amen.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.846
[Annalise] Thank y'all so much for coming.
It was wonderful.

09:59.932 --> 10:00.975
Sam.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.438
So, how'd you like the study?

10:06.022 --> 10:09.150
Yeah, yeah, I liked it a lot.
It reminded me of Sunday school.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.069
In fact, I can't remember
why I stopped going.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.323
A lot of people say that. [chuckles]

10:15.823 --> 10:17.533
You know what else they say?

10:17.617 --> 10:21.954
What I said when I'd messed up my life?
That I felt lonely and alone.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.415
But I wasn't really.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.209
Excuse me for a minute.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.379
I just made a muck of my life, you know?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.174
I gambled my inheritance, lost my girl.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.509
Shh! Be grateful for it.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.722
I-I fought with my mom, and I-I sent
her running out in front of that truck.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.891
Now I don't even have
the diamond I made from her.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.061
Are you talking about
compression services?

10:45.144 --> 10:46.771
Like with your Mom's ashes?

10:46.854 --> 10:47.688
Yeah.

10:49.106 --> 10:52.526
That is the most beautiful thing
I have ever heard.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.070
Really?

10:55.196 --> 10:58.449
Sam, have you ever been baptized?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.044
[Nathan] Hey, there, children.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.128
Grandpa.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.553
I got a proposition for you.
I'd like you to hear me out.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.139
We're gonna be pulling up stakes here
in a few days,

11:22.223 --> 11:24.642
and I'd like you to come back with us.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.560
And move in with me.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.982
Now, don't both of you
go answering all at once. [chuckles]

11:33.734 --> 11:34.694
Why you leaving?

11:34.777 --> 11:38.364
To be honest,
we're giving up the search for your uncle.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.991
I don't think we're ever gonna find him.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.703
That surprise you?

11:47.081 --> 11:47.915
Look.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.837
I know I haven't been a big part
of your lives for these last years,

11:52.920 --> 11:54.463
but that wasn't my choice.

11:54.547 --> 11:59.301
Being here, getting to spend time
with you, it's felt like a second chance.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.012
And I'm not gonna lie to you.

12:02.096 --> 12:06.976
I think you might be in danger here,
and I think you might think it too.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.690
Now, big decision. Take some time with it.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.416
[Mayhew] Just because
Charles and I are friends

12:30.499 --> 12:33.294
doesn't mean I'm gonna rubber-stamp this.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.879
I-I understand.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.340
Uh, ma'am.

12:38.966 --> 12:42.636
Your family's been raising hell
in Missouri for a long time.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.638
Uh, yes, ma'am.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.601
That kind of history,
sometimes it's hard to change.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.606
Have you changed?

12:56.358 --> 12:57.359
Yes, ma'am.

13:06.827 --> 13:11.165
[inhales] I-I gave up crime
when my daddy died.

13:12.416 --> 13:16.629
I've already made something of myself
I couldn't ever expected.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.715
I managed a casino.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.968
[chuckles] I even own a motel.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.011
So I see.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.139
And you've come into some money lately.
I mean, you're a lucky girl.

13:27.848 --> 13:31.560
Yeah, not so lucky.
I-I got that money 'cause my cousin died.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.312
I'm sorry.

13:34.230 --> 13:38.984
All the same, if I clean your record,
we're tied forever.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.779
You mess up again, it comes back on me.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.155
I-I don't plan to fuck up.

13:45.115 --> 13:45.950
Um…

13:46.033 --> 13:47.076
[clears throat] Miss, uh…

13:47.159 --> 13:49.036
[chuckles] Ma'am.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.788
Uh, judge.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.459
This is everything to me.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.170
Good.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.840
Here's what I'm gonna do.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.760
I'm gonna comb through
every arrest warrant, every police report,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.805
and every scrap of information
I can get on you.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.599
I may even find something
that the authorities missed.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.561
-Are you prepared for that?
-Mm-hmm.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.729
-You sure?
-Yes, ma'am.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.815
And provided that doesn't
turn up any surprises,

14:17.898 --> 14:20.025
I'll likely do a drop-in visit.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.654
Right. O-okay.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.740
Is that gonna be a problem for you, Ruth?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
N-no, no, not at all, ma'am.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.346
[knock on door]

15:03.986 --> 15:05.154
What's that?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.990
A petition for Jonah and Charlotte
to come live with me.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.575
[huffs]

15:09.658 --> 15:12.119
I think you oughta read it,
and I think you oughta sign it.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.329
That's never gonna happen.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.248
They wanna come, Wendy.
They are not safe with you.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.126
I'm not signing anything.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.713
Then I'll see you at family court
in three days for a hearing.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.715
-You don't wanna do that.
-Neither do you.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.926
I got my investigator ready to testify,

15:27.009 --> 15:29.595
and you know very well
what he's got on you. Sign it.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.890
-They wanna be with me.
-Get the fuck out of my house!

15:46.278 --> 15:48.739
-Did you know he was taking us to court?
-No.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.866
Did he ask you to go with him?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.244
-Both of you?
-Yeah.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.331
And what did you say?

16:00.834 --> 16:02.252
That we would.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.050
We are so close.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.387
So close to being out of this.
Do you realize that?

16:11.470 --> 16:12.930
It's not forever.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.224
Do you want to go with him?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.936
[sighs] It's just…

16:19.019 --> 16:22.189
[exhales] Grandpa's
not just gonna go away.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.857
I mean, he knows things, and--

16:24.900 --> 16:27.611
You know, how are we supposed
to protect you if we don't go with him?

16:29.029 --> 16:30.823
Let me worry about Grandpa.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.786
[Charlotte sighs]

16:55.139 --> 16:57.474
[Marty sighs]

16:57.558 --> 16:59.351
I'm not fucking letting them go.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.436
I know.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.983
Not to that house, with that man.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.818
What are we supposed to do though?

17:07.901 --> 17:10.446
I mean, he's-- he's playing
a-- a game of chicken, you know?

17:10.529 --> 17:13.741
He's-- he knows we can't let Mel testify.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.076
That's exactly right.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.539
We just need to make sure
that Mel never makes it to court.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.332
[sniffles]

17:26.545 --> 17:27.838
[sniffles]

17:33.093 --> 17:35.471
[car door opens, closes]

17:38.682 --> 17:40.267
There a problem?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.478
I wanted to come tell you myself.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.775
We arrested somebody for Wyatt's murder.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.028
Uh, who?

17:51.653 --> 17:55.407
Uh, Timothy Wheeling.
Comes out of Hastain.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.952
Worked in the fields off and on
for Darlene. You know him?

17:59.745 --> 18:02.331
Well, how-- how do you--
how do you know it was him?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.750
Let me show you something.

18:13.008 --> 18:17.096
Can you confirm this belonged to Wyatt?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.768
I wondered where it got to.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.354
Wheeling pawned it
two days before the murder,

18:25.437 --> 18:28.148
along with three pieces
of Darlene's jewelry.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.151
We think she found it missing
and accused him.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.445
Guy's got a long rap sheet.

18:33.529 --> 18:37.491
Armed robbery, felony breaking
and entering, weapons charges.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.244
Can I have it back?

18:41.954 --> 18:42.955
It's evidence.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.500
But I will get it back to you
as soon as I can.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.926
Why are you being
so nice to me all of a sudden?

18:56.009 --> 18:57.427
Coming all this way.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.556
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.143
Me and this new job.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.895
You sorry?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.648
Or did you hear I inherited Wyatt's money?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.528
[hesitates] I hope
this brings you some peace.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.783
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

19:33.714 --> 19:36.884
[Wendy] We want him reinstated
to the Chicago PD as soon as possible.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.303
[Marty] He's all cleaned up,
no more drugs.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.471
His, uh, PI work is impeccable.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.892
So, uh, when do you need this favor?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.936
W-we'd like an official offer
by the end of the day.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.105
Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

19:51.356 --> 19:56.445
You know, when somebody comes to me
and asks me to help out a detective,

19:56.528 --> 19:58.822
my guess is somebody's in trouble.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.657
Now, should I be worried?

20:00.741 --> 20:03.452
-[chuckles] Huh.
-Not at all.

20:03.535 --> 20:07.372
Well, I've already pulled
every string I can over at OFAC,

20:07.456 --> 20:09.958
but your money only spreads so thin.

20:16.757 --> 20:17.925
What do you need?

20:18.550 --> 20:21.136
Hmm, well, I do have one pressing matter.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.725
-My grandson's voting machines.
-No.

20:26.808 --> 20:30.103
Your boys in Wisconsin and Michigan
could really help us out there,

20:30.187 --> 20:32.022
get 'em in place before the next cycle.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.482
We can't do that.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.317
We won't.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.488
Okay, then.
Well, you have a choice to make.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.783
I'm not your dancing monkey, Wendy.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.118
Either one or the other.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.788
Now, Navarro off the SDN list

20:47.871 --> 20:51.833
or Mel Sattem rejoins Chicago PD.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.003
You go ahead,
and you let me know what you decide.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.636
Jesus. Even I stopped short
of massive fucking election fraud.

21:02.719 --> 21:03.971
He truly asked you that?

21:04.054 --> 21:05.055
He did.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.891
I-I can't do this, Jim.

21:08.976 --> 21:09.935
I know.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.730
So if we use Schafer
to help Mel get his job back,

21:13.814 --> 21:17.567
then we have to find someone else
to get Navarro off the SDN list.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.860
Yeah, won't be easy.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.445
Yeah, but it's possible, right?

21:21.029 --> 21:24.741
[sighs] Yeah, well, you're gonna
need four, maybe five new faces

21:24.825 --> 21:26.326
to pull Schafer's weight.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.787
Plus you're gonna
have to fill his board seat.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.665
Ideally someone well-placed
to run damage control

21:31.748 --> 21:34.293
in case he,
I don't know, takes this personally.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.964
I can put together a few names,
make a list, but it's gonna take some time

21:39.047 --> 21:41.049
for them all to get on board.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.593
How's Mr. Navarro's patience these days?

21:43.677 --> 21:45.304
-Wearing thin.
-He'll hold.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.430
Get me those names.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.641
And thank you, Jim. We'll-- we'll let
you know when to pull the trigger, okay?

21:49.725 --> 21:50.559
-Yeah.
-All right.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.144
-Thanks. Bye.
-[beeps]

21:52.227 --> 21:55.147
We can't let them go
to North Carolina with my father.

21:59.359 --> 22:02.487
Hi, Senator Schafer's office, please.
It's Wendy Byrde calling.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.616
[Dicicco] So I looked up your boy.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.953
Sounds like he was
a pretty good cop before he stole coke.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.331
[Marty] Yeah, that's what we're saying.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.293
Right, but then, you know, he stole coke.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.879
[Marty] Mm-hmm.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.258
-How'd you like your breaded steak?
-Oh, it's terrific.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.928
Look, here's the deal.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.807
You like the cokehead.
I like Schafer. Schafer likes you.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.518
Hence this conversation.

22:35.187 --> 22:40.108
We know the Chicago Police Department
has had a-- a tough PR hit lately,

22:40.942 --> 22:46.114
and we were wondering, m-maybe a donation…

22:48.116 --> 22:50.118
to the police union
might go a very long way

22:50.202 --> 22:52.204
in showing just how much
confidence we have.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.707
It'd be much appreciated.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.878
How soon you wanna get this done?

23:01.755 --> 23:02.756
Today.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.009
[chuckles]

23:08.929 --> 23:11.556
-Not today, huh?
-Ah, nah, nothing. I'm sorry.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.936
Something that I've always wanted to do
since I was a kid is

23:16.019 --> 23:19.731
cross Lake Michigan
to Wisconsin on a boat.

23:21.441 --> 23:25.237
Well, that sounds nice.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.406
Problem is I don't got a boat.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.630
What the fuck are you doing?

23:43.713 --> 23:44.965
Redecorating.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.884
You mind maybe doing it
when I'm not around?

23:50.554 --> 23:51.555
Hell.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.515
What's going on?

23:54.015 --> 23:56.560
They arrested someone for Wyatt's murder.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.189
Oh, shit.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.650
What are you gonna do?

24:04.901 --> 24:06.153
[scoffs]

24:06.236 --> 24:09.781
It's a little tough to explain
how I know he didn't do it,

24:09.865 --> 24:12.659
at least without spending
the rest of my life in prison.

24:13.160 --> 24:17.831
And-- and now I don't think
any judge is gonna figure out

24:17.914 --> 24:20.167
how to clean that off my record.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.544
Fuck.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.424
What do you know about the guy?

24:27.924 --> 24:32.387
Not much.
Worked a few odd jobs for Darlene.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.723
Didn't kill her.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.103
What the fuck should I do?

24:42.189 --> 24:43.190
Oh, no. [chuckles]

24:44.441 --> 24:46.693
Don't-- don't look at me. I, uh…

24:48.528 --> 24:50.697
Nah, I fucked up about every--

24:50.780 --> 24:54.201
yeah, every major decision
I ever made, so…

24:56.119 --> 24:57.579
You want my advice?

25:00.373 --> 25:01.583
Don't take my advice.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.716
-You want a turn?
-Does it feel good?

25:09.799 --> 25:11.635
Felt real fucking good.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.142
[gun cocks]

25:27.567 --> 25:29.569
[vehicle approaching]

25:34.199 --> 25:36.826
[door opens, closes]

25:38.828 --> 25:39.746
[sniffles]

25:41.790 --> 25:43.792
Well, I see you're seizing the day.

25:43.875 --> 25:48.213
I-I was going over receipts
at the motel until two a.m.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.304
Pretty spot, isn't it?

25:56.388 --> 26:00.517
Except for all our shit fucking it up.
[chuckles]

26:02.602 --> 26:04.104
What happened over there?

26:05.272 --> 26:06.940
Oh, oh, that-- that was my daddy's.

26:07.899 --> 26:08.858
Oh.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.195
I looked over your record.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.533
Seems like you were with your father
or some other family member

26:16.616 --> 26:18.785
every time you got arrested.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.788
Pretty much.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.124
Led you astray, huh?

26:27.919 --> 26:28.920
No.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.506
No, I-I did that all by myself.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.931
They're all dead now.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.017
I saw.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.230
Why do you think
Charlie Wilkes called me about you?

26:49.482 --> 26:50.775
I don't know. I--

26:50.859 --> 26:53.820
I asked for his advice when
I found out about the Snell money,

26:53.903 --> 26:58.074
and I guess he took a shine to me
when I was working at the casino.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.498
[Mayhew sighs]

27:10.754 --> 27:11.838
[gasps]

27:15.300 --> 27:16.426
I don't, uh,

27:17.927 --> 27:20.764
I don't blame you for doubting me, ma'am.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.060
I get it. I do.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.772
But I promise you,

27:29.814 --> 27:31.316
you clean me up,

27:31.399 --> 27:35.779
and I will do
whatever it takes to stay that way.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.455
Well,

27:46.665 --> 27:49.125
that-- that reinstates you
to the Chicago PD,

27:49.209 --> 27:50.877
contingent that you start immediately.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.671
-[Mel] I-I know what it is.
-Okay.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.049
Needless to say,
we went on a serious limb for you.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.133
[Mel] Just don't.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.266
And the fact that
I'm due in court tomorrow?

28:07.143 --> 28:10.647
Oh, I'm afraid, well, they would need you
in Chicago immediately.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.815
Right.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.694
[chuckles] Wow.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.115
You people are good.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.493
Jesus Christ.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.205
[scoffs] Dicicco.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.625
Fat bastard. What'd you, uh, promise him?

28:31.251 --> 28:34.838
[inhales] A car, boat?

28:35.755 --> 28:36.840
Hmm.

28:37.841 --> 28:41.511
Look, uh, I-- you can do
some real good as a cop again.

28:41.594 --> 28:43.012
Don't talk to me about that, okay?

28:43.096 --> 28:46.433
All I wanted for the last four years
is a chance to be a cop again.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.977
-Well, now you got it.
-Fuck you.

28:49.602 --> 28:54.190
Look, I--I know you-- you think
you've uncovered something about us,

28:54.274 --> 28:58.862
some deep, dark secret,
but the-- the truth is you're wrong.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.824
And I can-- I can promise you,
you've reached the absolute end

29:02.907 --> 29:04.868
of what you can learn about my brother.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.872
I think you should take the gig
and go do some good

29:08.955 --> 29:12.083
'cause the only thing you're gonna do here

29:12.167 --> 29:14.878
is you're gonna--
you're gonna break up a family.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.693
[Mel] I mean, they saw me do what I do.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.278
They know I'm good at it.

29:42.822 --> 29:46.534
You know, maybe a small part of 'em
thinks I'm more valuable with a badge.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.244
[man] More valuable to who?

29:49.245 --> 29:51.915
-[exhales]
-Just how bad are these people?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.626
[chuckles] I don't know.

29:54.709 --> 29:55.794
[sighs]

29:57.170 --> 29:59.798
Scale of one to ten,
ten being pure evil, uh,

30:01.299 --> 30:03.593
nine, nine point five.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.809
We're talking about
getting my old life back.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.687
I know. This is-- this is difficult shit.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.150
So?

30:19.818 --> 30:23.696
The high-road move is telling them
to shove it up their ass.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.574
Then again, four years
you've been tearing my ear off

30:26.658 --> 30:30.370
about wanting your old job back,
and I always tell you the same thing.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.914
"More will be revealed."

30:34.290 --> 30:35.875
Well, maybe it just was.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.879
I don't know.
God's will comes in all shapes and sizes.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.633
So what are you telling me?

30:43.716 --> 30:47.846
To get real quiet
and hear your HP's voice.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.723
Or maybe you already did.

31:12.745 --> 31:15.039
Samuel Eugene Dermody,

31:15.874 --> 31:20.128
you have strayed from God's path,
and, in so doing, have suffered.

31:21.421 --> 31:25.592
Are you ready to accept the Lord
Jesus Christ as your personal savior?

31:26.217 --> 31:27.552
Yes, I am.

31:28.636 --> 31:29.596
Well…

31:33.099 --> 31:36.436
then let him look
into those beautiful eyes.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.314
[panting]

31:39.981 --> 31:41.316
[grunts]

31:41.399 --> 31:44.444
I baptize you in the name of the Father…

31:44.527 --> 31:45.403
[Sam gasps]

31:47.322 --> 31:48.865
-…the Son…
-[gasps]

31:50.950 --> 31:52.285
…and the Holy Ghost.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.246
[crowd applauding]

32:04.255 --> 32:05.256
Brother Sam!

32:07.550 --> 32:09.010
So proud, Sam.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.055
[woman] Well done!

32:12.138 --> 32:13.431
[man] Hard to believe it.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.393
-[Annalise] Congratulations, Sam.
-[panting]

32:17.477 --> 32:20.104
May the Lord's light
always shine upon you.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.651
[gasps]

32:29.530 --> 32:32.283
Really ought to charge more
for poolside revivals.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.077
[both chuckle]

32:36.955 --> 32:42.669
I, uh, I figured you might wanna take this
with you since you're headed out of state.

32:42.752 --> 32:43.670
[sighs]

32:47.006 --> 32:50.677
You don't want to,
um, keep some for yourself?

32:52.679 --> 32:56.557
Not sure how he'd feel about us
divvying him up like a bag of sugar.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.934
[Jonah chuckles]

33:06.943 --> 33:09.237
Hey, are you--
are you coming to court tomorrow?

33:11.072 --> 33:12.115
Of course.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.832
[exhales] You wanna hear something crazy?

33:22.291 --> 33:26.045
[clicks tongue] I ain't got
a criminal record no more.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.340
-Really?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.383
[sighs]

33:30.466 --> 33:33.553
Email came in from Board of Corrections
ten minutes ago.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.097
-[both laugh]
-How did you swing that?

33:37.098 --> 33:39.142
I know a guy who owns a judge.

33:40.893 --> 33:42.478
But… [exhales]

33:42.562 --> 33:43.980
…Wilkes put in a good word for me.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.149
That's amazing.

33:47.233 --> 33:49.485
[chuckles] How does it feel?

33:53.156 --> 33:54.949
[chuckles] I…

33:57.952 --> 34:01.789
I don't know.
It's, uh, it's just words, right?

34:11.716 --> 34:12.675
[sighs]

34:23.061 --> 34:25.646
[Marty] What are we supposed
to tell him about the SDN list?

34:25.730 --> 34:26.731
It's in motion.

34:27.565 --> 34:31.486
-[Marty] Well, except it's not.
-Well, it is. It's just delayed.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.947
Wendy, if we take too long
to find a replacement for Schafer,

34:35.031 --> 34:37.408
it's gonna give Camila
more time to make a move.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.828
[sighs] I'll tell Jim to work faster,
but hopefully Camila will be

34:40.912 --> 34:43.581
too bogged down
in the day-to-day to be making moves.

34:49.879 --> 34:52.799
I didn't realize
that you would be here, Camila.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.885
Omar thought it was important.

34:57.553 --> 34:58.763
Is there an issue?

35:00.139 --> 35:02.350
Where do we stand on the SDN list?

35:03.351 --> 35:06.062
-It's in motion.
-[Omar] That's not what I hear, Wendy.

35:06.771 --> 35:10.024
I asked my lawyer
to look into the status quietly.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.693
She said no petition has been filed.

35:13.319 --> 35:17.073
-Mm-hmm. We're still back-channeling.
-And I'm still in this pinche prison.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.243
We need to be laundering more.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.914
We're laundering the same pace
we've always been.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.457
Yeah, that's my point.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.795
We need to spread
more money around in Mexico.

35:30.878 --> 35:34.715
We also need clean money for
the officials that would allow my brother

35:34.799 --> 35:38.136
to make a quick exit from
whatever prison he's been transferred to.

35:39.804 --> 35:43.141
Yeah, we-- we can cover that
with the current amounts.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.268
We also have a chance to expand.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.604
With the pharmaceutical deal,

35:48.688 --> 35:51.566
we're gonna need more product,
and that means more land.

35:52.650 --> 35:56.445
[inhales] I also need money
to spread across our lieutenants.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.489
I need them calm and happy.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.076
Yeah, um,

36:03.703 --> 36:05.037
I'll launder more.

36:05.621 --> 36:06.497
Good.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.834
Wendy, when can you get me off this list?

36:11.836 --> 36:13.921
-Realistically, in a few months.
-[Omar] No.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.298
Not months.

36:16.883 --> 36:18.092
Not weeks.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.306
Days. Yeah?

36:25.099 --> 36:27.768
-Hmm?
-We'll get back to work.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.903
-I'll call Jim.
-[Marty] Yeah, and tell him what?

36:36.986 --> 36:39.864
His four-month window
now needs to be accomplished in four days?

36:39.947 --> 36:43.242
You know-- you know,
she's spreading that money around

36:43.326 --> 36:45.161
to buy loyalty with the lieutenants.

36:45.244 --> 36:46.120
Yeah, I know.

36:46.204 --> 36:50.249
Do you? Yeah, because, you know,
we need to get him off the list right now

36:50.333 --> 36:53.753
so that we can tell him what's going on,
and he can take care of her.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.926
[inhales] Fuck!

37:12.813 --> 37:13.940
[huffs]

37:17.777 --> 37:20.988
Hi. It's Wendy Byrde
for Senator Schafer's office, please.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.282
Thank you.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.453
[Randall] Wendy Byrde.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.872
Tell me you got good news.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.708
We can give you what you need
in Michigan and Wisconsin.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.409
Who the fuck are you?

38:09.328 --> 38:10.746
Did Pam send you?

38:12.164 --> 38:14.834
No, I don't-- I don't know Pam.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.797
So, you from the lawyer?

38:22.550 --> 38:24.927
It was my cousin's guitar you stole.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.346
I've seen you before
over at the Snell place.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.973
I used to work over there.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.102
The fuck you do for Darlene Snell?

38:34.520 --> 38:35.896
You two dykes or something?

38:38.774 --> 38:41.235
I just wanna know
why you stole that guitar.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.822
If it was your cousin's guitar
that I stole,

38:45.364 --> 38:47.199
that means it was
your cousin that got murdered.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.327
So, why haven't you asked me about that?

38:50.619 --> 38:52.371
I didn't do it, by the way.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.502
Just tell me
why you stole that fucking guitar.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.421
[chuckles] For drugs, bitch.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.132
Fuck.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.219
Why does anyone steal anything?

39:12.016 --> 39:13.392
Where are you from?

39:15.811 --> 39:16.812
Jadwin.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.440
Where are you from?

39:19.523 --> 39:20.608
Osage.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.904
What's your name?

39:24.987 --> 39:26.447
Ruth Langmore.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.367
I know your people.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.911
Russ Langmore, he was your daddy?

39:32.787 --> 39:34.413
He was a real piece of shit.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.124
[huffs] He was my uncle.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.378
Dead, huh?

39:42.797 --> 39:44.131
[inhales]

39:44.215 --> 39:46.592
I lost both my brothers
the last two years.

39:48.594 --> 39:49.762
Fucking assholes.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.057
Both of 'em.

39:55.434 --> 39:58.479
[inhales] Uh, thanks--
thanks for your-- for your time.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.563
Hey!

40:02.566 --> 40:04.276
Why the fuck you really come here?

40:06.612 --> 40:08.614
I just wanted to lay eyes on you.

40:10.449 --> 40:14.245
Yo, I know you heard me before…
when I said I didn't do it.

40:15.955 --> 40:18.916
Well, you sure as shit did something.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.429
[Mel] I mean,
my sponsor says it's God's will.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.681
[Maya] Then what are
you talking to me for?

40:38.185 --> 40:39.145
[exhales]

40:41.439 --> 40:43.107
I was a really good cop.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.109
-You still are.
-Yeah.

40:46.902 --> 40:50.406
I do a bang-up job of helping
the highest bidder weasel out of alimony.

40:50.489 --> 40:51.532
[inhales]

40:53.492 --> 40:58.289
Whenever I'm twisting myself in a pretzel
like you are right now,

40:59.457 --> 41:02.126
it's because I know
exactly what I should be doing,

41:03.127 --> 41:06.338
and I want someone to come along
and tell me I don't have to.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.800
I'm not gonna be that someone for you.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.304
You'll hate yourself.

41:13.387 --> 41:14.972
-You don't know that.
-I do.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.308
I've been there.

41:21.353 --> 41:22.813
And if I'm not like you?

41:25.900 --> 41:27.860
Then I don't wanna see you again.

41:30.446 --> 41:32.156
And I'm really hoping I do.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.730
[cell phone ringing]

42:08.359 --> 42:09.360
[Marty] Hello, Maya.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.570
[Maya] What is it with you people?

42:12.488 --> 42:17.159
You see someone doing good, and you think,
"Hey, how can I fuck up their life?"

42:19.453 --> 42:20.996
Not sure what we're talking about here.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.375
I just had coffee with Mel Sattem.

42:25.751 --> 42:29.755
Listen, he's a grown man
with a chance to do the work he loves.

42:30.464 --> 42:32.633
Oh, so the whole
brain trust is here. Good.

42:32.716 --> 42:35.469
Let me just say,
from the depth of my soul,

42:35.553 --> 42:38.806
if you succeed, God'll still know.

42:39.431 --> 42:40.933
There's no escape.

42:42.851 --> 42:44.770
So, Mel's going back to Chicago?

42:45.354 --> 42:47.231
No, he's weighing his humanity.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.986
I'd explain but, you know, why?

42:59.702 --> 43:01.203
Marty, are you still there?

43:02.538 --> 43:03.372
Yep.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.208
You had a choice.

43:08.043 --> 43:09.503
[line beeps]

43:21.181 --> 43:23.183
[engine turns over]

43:24.184 --> 43:25.769
[gears ratchet]

43:33.944 --> 43:36.071
[judge] I assume we're still
waiting on Mr. Sattem.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.281
[Nathan] Yes, ma'am.

43:37.364 --> 43:39.825
And when exactly can we expect him?

43:39.908 --> 43:44.246
Any minute now.
I just called, and, uh, he didn't answer.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.290
I imagine 'cause he's on his way.

43:46.915 --> 43:49.627
Well, you'd best call him again,
Mr. Davis.

43:49.710 --> 43:52.212
I'm giving him
exactly ten minutes to show.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.632
-My docket is full.
-Yes, ma'am.

43:59.219 --> 44:01.513
-[line ringing]
-[sighs]

44:07.227 --> 44:09.980
[Sam humming "Wade in the Water"]

44:10.064 --> 44:12.066
[rings, vibrates]

44:16.153 --> 44:19.156
[Mel] I always loved it
when they played that one in church.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.660
I accepted Jesus Christ as
my Lord and personal savior yesterday.

44:22.743 --> 44:24.453
-Yeah. No, I saw that.
-Yeah.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.665
-Good for you.
-Thanks.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.249
-Just checking out.
-[cell phone rings]

44:29.333 --> 44:31.460
Will you be joining us again anytime soon?

44:33.170 --> 44:35.381
[exhales] Nah, probably not.

44:35.464 --> 44:37.841
[Sam] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

44:38.550 --> 44:41.178
Don't be. It's got nothing to do with you.

44:42.304 --> 44:43.305
Hey, um,

44:44.014 --> 44:47.518
I've been meaning to ask, uh, about AA.

44:47.601 --> 44:50.270
You know, if--
if you found it helpful 'cause…

44:51.563 --> 44:54.483
Yeah, I was considering
giving Gamblers Anonymous a go.

44:55.901 --> 44:58.070
Everything I have today is 'cause of AA.

44:59.988 --> 45:02.199
-You have a good one.
-Yeah, you too.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.840
Mr. Davis, would you like to proceed
with the hearing without your witness?

45:17.923 --> 45:19.842
It's just that any factual information I--

45:19.925 --> 45:22.094
[judge] It's a simple question, Mr. Davis.

45:23.387 --> 45:26.098
I don't believe my grandchildren
are safe in that house.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.474
Mr. Davis.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.896
No, Your Honor.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.816
[judge] In that case,
the Court is prepared to rule.

45:36.442 --> 45:39.528
What do you mean "rule"?
There was no hearing.

45:39.611 --> 45:43.657
But there is a petition on my desk,
and I am fully aware

45:43.741 --> 45:46.744
of the unstable home life
these children have had to endure.

45:46.827 --> 45:49.204
That Jonah Byrde
has been living in a motel,

45:49.288 --> 45:52.040
and that both his parents
were recently arrested.

45:52.124 --> 45:54.752
But, Your Honor,
there were no charges filed.

45:57.045 --> 46:00.841
[judge] Considering that Charlotte
is months away from her 18th birthday,

46:01.508 --> 46:03.969
it is the opinion of this court
that she should be free

46:04.052 --> 46:06.221
to make a decision about her own welfare.

46:06.305 --> 46:07.389
Jonah's only 15.

46:07.473 --> 46:12.561
It is the further opinion of this court
that if Jonah can live in a motel,

46:13.145 --> 46:16.607
there can be no reasonable argument as
to why he cannot move to North Carolina…

46:16.690 --> 46:17.524
[exhales]

46:17.608 --> 46:18.942
…in custody of a family member.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.404
[exhales]

46:23.238 --> 46:27.743
Jonah, Charlotte, you're old enough
to decide for yourselves.

46:29.620 --> 46:30.621
Next.

46:36.043 --> 46:39.213
You know, I thought that was a little, um,

46:40.088 --> 46:42.591
hasty. I think she… [mutters]

46:53.185 --> 46:54.978
Take all the time you need.

47:05.405 --> 47:06.907
What is going on?

47:09.201 --> 47:10.202
Jonah?

47:10.828 --> 47:12.412
We're going with Grandpa.

47:13.038 --> 47:15.332
-Come on.
-You're not-- you're not serious.

47:15.415 --> 47:17.167
-Both of you? Really?
-[Charlotte] I'm sorry.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.752
-What did he say to you?
-Nothing.

47:18.836 --> 47:21.338
He must've said something to you.
You said you didn't wanna go.

47:21.421 --> 47:23.590
-I never said that.
-Yes, you did. You said to me--

47:23.674 --> 47:24.925
You just heard what you wanted.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.760
Why don't we talk
about this at home, okay?

47:26.844 --> 47:28.637
-[Charlotte] Dad.
-We'll talk in the morning?

47:28.720 --> 47:31.139
-What is there to talk about?
-Everything.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.016
All you do is talk.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.227
Nothing changes.

47:35.310 --> 47:38.897
If there was something to say,
do you think she would actually hear us?

47:38.981 --> 47:41.817
Charlotte, you don't understand
what you're getting into, okay?

47:41.900 --> 47:45.362
-Your grandfather is not a good man.
-You think that because Mom told you to.

47:45.445 --> 47:47.739
-[Marty] That's not true.
-You just do everything she says.

47:47.823 --> 47:51.285
-[Marty] No, I do not.
-Dad, you said so yourself.

47:51.368 --> 47:54.329
-What?
-She only does what she wants.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.248
The whole thing's rigged.

47:56.331 --> 47:59.084
Okay. That had nothing to do
with your grandfather.

47:59.167 --> 48:02.838
He doesn't have
your best interests in mind, okay?

48:02.921 --> 48:05.132
You're not 18 yet, and you're far from it.

48:05.716 --> 48:08.969
You need to think about the house
you're moving into, okay?

48:09.052 --> 48:12.222
And who runs it… [continues indistinctly]

48:15.058 --> 48:15.893
Daddy.

48:17.811 --> 48:19.229
[shudders]

48:19.313 --> 48:20.814
Daddy, please.

48:21.607 --> 48:24.276
Don't-- don't take them.

48:24.359 --> 48:26.612
Don't-- don't take them away from me.

48:26.695 --> 48:29.573
I will do whatever you want.
I-I-I will do anything.

48:29.656 --> 48:32.200
Just tell me.
Just tell me. Tell me what it is.

48:32.284 --> 48:34.870
What can I give you?
What do-- just-- just tell me.

48:34.953 --> 48:37.289
Just tell me what it is you want.
I'll give you anything.

48:37.372 --> 48:38.457
Stop it, Wendy.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.709
Daddy, please, please, please.

48:40.792 --> 48:45.547
Don't-- don't take them away from me.
I will do whatever you want. Please.

48:46.548 --> 48:47.758
I'm sorry.

48:48.425 --> 48:50.802
I am. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

48:50.886 --> 48:54.264
I'm sorry that I'm so hard to love.
I don't-- I don't mean to be.

48:54.348 --> 48:57.643
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.
I'm sorry that I left home.

48:57.726 --> 48:58.936
I'm sorry.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.730
I'm sorry, but please
do not take my children! Do–

49:01.813 --> 49:03.523
I am not doing this to hurt you.

49:03.607 --> 49:05.901
I am just trying
to keep my grandchildren safe.

49:05.984 --> 49:07.819
Let them-- let me keep them.

49:07.903 --> 49:10.113
Just-- just don't
take them away from me, please.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.699
I will be-- I will be so good.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.701
I will.
I'll do whatever you want. Just tell me.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.620
Tell me. Tell me what to do! Please!

49:16.703 --> 49:21.291
I want you to get up and stop
making a fool of yourself, Wendy Marie.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.960
Nobody's falling for this anymore.

49:23.043 --> 49:26.046
When I am done,
they are gonna know exactly what you are,

49:26.129 --> 49:28.423
and they are never coming back to you.

50:10.590 --> 50:11.591
[door opens]

50:14.386 --> 50:15.345
[door closes]

50:16.555 --> 50:18.348
-[keys jangle]
-[engine turns over]

50:18.432 --> 50:19.307
[bangs]
