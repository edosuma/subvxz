00:09.340 --> 00:11.540
Chris: I think
there's a grouse.

00:11.570 --> 00:14.610
It flew right back in here.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.580
Jessi: Oh, right here,
right here, right here,
right here.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.080
It's a good size grouse.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.890
Chris: Yeah.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.300
Jessi: If I miss the shot,

00:35.330 --> 00:38.100
I could totally
lose the bird,

00:38.130 --> 00:40.730
and I can't waste
those opportunities,

00:40.770 --> 00:43.040
or come December,
January, February,

00:43.070 --> 00:46.410
I'm going to be
sorely disappointed.

00:47.910 --> 00:48.980
Chris: You got about
three seconds to get on

00:49.010 --> 00:50.740
him and kill him.

00:50.780 --> 00:52.080
Jessi: Ow, dang.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.620
Oh, come on.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.890
Thank you, grouse.
Thank you, grouse.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.490
Thank you, grouse.
Thank you, grouse.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.960
When it comes to
hunting and fishing,

01:04.990 --> 01:06.830
I will get my hands dirty.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.560
I took off its head cause
I want it to die fast.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.270
Chris: Oh, good job.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.970
Jessi: I don't
want him to suffer.

01:14.270 --> 01:16.040
I feel like this is an omen.

01:16.070 --> 01:17.640
Winter is coming.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.010
We need to get everything
buttoned up so we can make it

01:20.040 --> 01:22.640
through the rough winter
that it always is.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.460
Jessi: Great, there's that.

01:35.490 --> 01:37.490
Chris: Ah, this is
the one that I wanna use.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.590
Should probably
check this thing out,

01:39.630 --> 01:41.600
it's been sitting up
there a little while.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.200
Just stretch it all
the way out for me.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.130
The fall in alaska's
pretty short.

01:46.170 --> 01:49.170
And the cosna's a really
tough place to harvest fish.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.210
Ice is coming,
and once that hits,

01:52.240 --> 01:54.840
we're going to have to pull
our nets and stop fishing,

01:55.810 --> 01:57.780
which means you have to do
everything in your power in a

01:57.810 --> 02:00.150
very limited amount of
time to catch these fish.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.280
Gotta make sure all the
knots are tight but looks

02:04.320 --> 02:06.420
like it's in good shape.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.160
Jessi: And this is
supposed to be tied, right?

02:08.190 --> 02:09.560
Like that?

02:09.590 --> 02:11.890
Chris: Yeah, make
sure it's tight enough
a fishy can't get out.

02:11.930 --> 02:14.260
I think we should go, try
dropping this thing in.

02:15.060 --> 02:17.460
If the fish get in there,
they're not getting out.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.040
The fats that
you find in fish are
really healthy for you.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.370
As we get into
the colder days,

02:26.410 --> 02:28.340
we're really gonna need those.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.310
When you eat it, you can
actually feel the energy burn

02:30.350 --> 02:32.280
inside of you.

02:32.310 --> 02:34.950
Especially when it's
40 and 50 below.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.320
So, it's one of the best
sources of fat that we really

02:37.350 --> 02:39.290
want to chase after.

02:42.860 --> 02:45.330
Okay. Yeah.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.760
There's a small eddy
up here on the river that

02:47.800 --> 02:49.260
I'd like to get down to.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.430
It looked like it was a
pretty good fishing spot

02:51.470 --> 02:53.730
from our side of the river.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.670
See if we can work
our way down there.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.110
Just walk really carefully.

02:59.710 --> 03:03.080
Jessi: The river is
obviously coming downriver.

03:03.110 --> 03:04.440
Is this the spot?

03:04.480 --> 03:06.750
Chris: Yeah, look at this nice
little eddy that's coming in.

03:06.780 --> 03:09.780
Jessi: That eddy is a
current, actually going up,

03:09.820 --> 03:13.150
and its usually kind of a
small area on the outer bank

03:13.190 --> 03:15.120
and that's where we want
to put the fyke net.

03:15.160 --> 03:19.360
Chris: And we're gonna
go one, two, and release.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.360
Jessi: We want the fyke
net in the pathway that the

03:23.400 --> 03:25.670
fish is gonna take when
it's going upriver.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.670
Chris: And let it sink.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.540
Jessi: The fish is gonna
take that turn into the eddy,

03:30.570 --> 03:33.740
exactly where the opening
of the fyke net needs to be.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.780
Chris: Perfect.
That looks great.

03:36.810 --> 03:38.480
(grunt)

03:38.510 --> 03:42.650
but we gotta expect that the
water's gonna come up too, so.

03:42.850 --> 03:46.390
Jessi: Yeah,
I mean if it comes up more
than two or three feet,

03:46.420 --> 03:48.490
we might, you know,
be in trouble,

03:48.520 --> 03:51.160
but I am slightly worried
about the fyke net.

03:51.190 --> 03:54.760
The river is rising right now,
so if the river rises too much,

03:54.800 --> 03:57.560
or if the bank
gives away, we're out,

03:57.600 --> 03:59.800
our only fyke net.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.700
But I'm still gonna give
it a shot because there is
still a chance that tomorrow,

04:03.740 --> 04:05.870
that thing's gonna
be full of fish.

04:06.340 --> 04:09.310
Chris: It is very important
to catch fresh food out here.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.080
We're always low.

04:11.110 --> 04:13.350
And this is gonna be
a way to get ahead.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.950
Michael: This asphalt
that we put down;

04:18.990 --> 04:21.520
this is just a little blip
in the history of humans.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.720
You know, these liquid roads?

04:23.760 --> 04:25.790
These are the
realest road around.

04:30.730 --> 04:33.770
Michael: The crisp part of
fall is finally kicking in.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.200
Frost every night.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.070
This is prime time for moose.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.380
I'm moving with a purpose.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.150
My heart is just pumping hard.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.880
I'm in the hunt mode.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.120
And this right here,
this frosty, freezing cold,

04:53.160 --> 04:56.460
this is what gets them
big bulls moving down here

04:56.490 --> 04:58.360
to the river.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.560
And today's gonna
be a good day.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.430
<i> Narrator: With moose</i>
<i> hunting season nearing an end,</i>

05:05.470 --> 05:08.370
<i> michael manzo must track</i>
<i> down a bull moose to</i>

05:08.400 --> 05:11.910
<i> secure his lifeline of meat</i>
<i> for the dark winter ahead.</i>

05:14.880 --> 05:17.880
Michael: My pursuit
of new wild river,

05:17.910 --> 05:20.110
this feeds it very well.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.380
This is one of the
slimmest rivers I think

05:22.420 --> 05:24.750
I've ever hunted.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.990
And I'm happy to be here,

05:28.020 --> 05:31.020
but I would really
like to come out of here
with some moose meat.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.730
That is the number
one priority.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.600
To subsist for the winter
off what I catch in the fall.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.340
The fog's starting to
clear and I see a big bluff

05:44.370 --> 05:47.210
relatively close to the river.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.580
So, I'm gonna hike up there.

05:50.380 --> 05:54.250
Get to sendin' some calls out
and try to get on a moose.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.860
A couple more hard frosts,

06:01.890 --> 06:05.060
these leaves will
drop off these trees.

06:05.330 --> 06:08.600
I might be able to see
another twenty yards in

06:08.660 --> 06:11.700
and catch a moose that I
otherwise wouldn't have seen.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.770
Moose tracks.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.670
They're here.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.740
There's a lot of activity here.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.840
This is a highway.

06:23.310 --> 06:26.310
This is what I'm looking for.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.790
The anticipation builds
as this fog is set in.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.420
You couldn't even cut
that with a knife.

06:36.860 --> 06:39.190
I just really want to
see this landscape,

06:39.230 --> 06:42.260
get my bearings and get my
moose calls up above the

06:42.300 --> 06:44.430
sounds of the water.

06:47.270 --> 06:48.700
If I see a moose.

06:48.740 --> 06:52.640
It's gonna be a safe but mad
dash down this mountaintop.

06:55.380 --> 06:59.780
As this fog recedes back
from the cold frosty night,

07:00.680 --> 07:04.050
all the peaks
should be exposed.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.950
I'll get my call up.

07:10.560 --> 07:16.800
(imitating moose call)

07:19.100 --> 07:21.770
I might keep my eyes peeled
on this little creek here.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.710
I can see good depth
a couple, three miles up.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.380
Looks like it's got
some good flow to it.

07:30.810 --> 07:34.210
I'm gonna get down to the
boat and motor down here,

07:35.620 --> 07:38.320
check out this creek.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.490
Brittany: Living out here in
mccarthy it's not super easy

07:43.530 --> 07:47.130
to just run to the grocery
store any time you need meat.

07:50.930 --> 07:53.670
Brittany: Ahh,
what do you hear?

07:53.700 --> 07:55.800
What do you hear?

07:55.840 --> 07:57.070
Look at that.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.740
What do you think's
in the cages?

07:58.770 --> 07:59.740
Elovie: Bunnies.

07:59.780 --> 08:00.940
Brittany: Bunnies?

08:00.980 --> 08:03.780
Yay! You got us bunnies.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.610
How'd they do on
the four-wheeler?

08:05.650 --> 08:06.880
Kaleb: Oh, they did great.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.280
Brittany: Yeah?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.980
So, normally in the winter,
we have about 30 people here.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.520
This last winter
when covid started,

08:13.560 --> 08:15.290
there were around 100 people,

08:15.320 --> 08:19.130
which is a big deal when
thinking about the fall hunts.

08:19.160 --> 08:24.330
We may not have enough
big game animals to
feed that many people,

08:24.600 --> 08:27.500
so I decided to start
raising some of our own meat.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.340
All right, you can open it.

08:29.370 --> 08:32.340
Elovie: So pretty and nice.

08:32.370 --> 08:34.570
Not even biting.

08:34.610 --> 08:35.740
Brittany: Are you
excited to see little

08:35.780 --> 08:37.240
baby rabbits sometime?

08:37.280 --> 08:41.180
My children are
definitely too young to go
out hunting on their own,

08:41.220 --> 08:46.750
however they can
begin to learn things
like animal husbandry.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.120
I have never
built a rabbit cage.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.960
I have never raised rabbits,

08:51.990 --> 08:53.860
but I'm very
eager to try both.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.060
I'll be building
these hutches with
my six year-old, gilbert.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.430
Hold this.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.370
(drill whirring)

09:02.600 --> 09:03.700
look at that.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.110
And my four-year-old, elovie.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.570
You do it.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.680
Elovie: Whoa.

09:09.910 --> 09:13.110
Brittany: Nice.
'kay, can you please not?

09:14.280 --> 09:15.680
Hopefully no one gets hurt.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.080
<i> ♪ I talk it out, talk it out,</i>
<i> I talk it out, I talk ♪♪</i>

09:18.120 --> 09:19.690
brittany: But I think it's
going to be a lot of fun.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.420
I don't often get to use
power tools, but when I do,

09:21.460 --> 09:23.190
I like it.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.190
This is not a
kaleb rowland building.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.530
This is a
brittany rowland building.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.730
And that means it will
have some beautiful unique

09:30.770 --> 09:34.600
qualities such as
not being square.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.410
Elovie: That looks
too beautiful.

09:38.470 --> 09:40.510
Brittany: Too beautiful?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.740
There we go.

09:44.780 --> 09:46.750
The frame is done.

09:46.780 --> 09:48.850
The walls are the next phase.

09:52.150 --> 09:56.060
Alex: If I'm not going to
buy new technology to solve
all of my inconveniences,

09:56.090 --> 09:58.390
then what I have to
do is change myself.

09:58.430 --> 09:59.930
It's not really
to define myself,

09:59.960 --> 10:01.560
it's more to refine myself.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.230
There's only a few days
left of moose season.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.100
After that, moose
is off the table,

10:09.140 --> 10:11.470
and I'll have to depend on
whatever small game I can hunt.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.810
If I get a moose, that's
basically peace of mind for

10:14.840 --> 10:17.410
the entire winter.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.650
To do my moose calling,

10:19.880 --> 10:21.820
it's a little better
to have a megaphone.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.280
Of course,
you can, you know,

10:23.320 --> 10:24.650
buy plastic
ones at the store.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.920
I don't have access to that,
so, uh, birch bark will do.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.120
Think that's good.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.590
I've never done this before,

10:30.630 --> 10:33.060
but it's always fun
to try something new.

10:34.730 --> 10:37.230
No matter, like, how tough
you are, how smart you are.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.130
This is working
real good, I think.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.400
You have to be ready
to reinvent yourself.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.340
Pull it tight.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.880
My name is alex javor and
we're in bear creek, alaska.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.550
There's not too many
places left in the world

10:52.580 --> 10:54.980
where you can be free.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.480
Living a really soft
lifestyle in the city,

10:57.520 --> 10:59.650
I wanted to see if I could
just move out into the

10:59.690 --> 11:01.790
wilderness and make it.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.760
I could've lived
off-grid in tennessee,

11:04.790 --> 11:07.160
but I chose alaska
for the challenge.

11:09.130 --> 11:13.430
My main goal living out
here is to wean myself
off the teat of society,

11:14.470 --> 11:19.840
to get all of my meat and
a lot of my food in general

11:19.880 --> 11:21.780
just from the land here.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.280
Everything here
is more extreme.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.320
And that's what I like.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.120
You also have to remember,

11:34.160 --> 11:36.320
this place is
always bigger than you.

11:37.290 --> 11:40.130
Yeah, just like that.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.830
Perfect.

11:42.060 --> 11:44.360
I got a new tool I can
take with me for the hunt.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.530
Hopefully it'll, uh, be
worth the time it took to make.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.270
(animal call)

11:51.310 --> 11:52.540
(clears throat)

11:52.570 --> 11:53.770
ah, it's more like.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.140
(animal call)

11:57.050 --> 11:59.550
(animal call)

11:59.580 --> 12:00.950
sipsey!

12:01.320 --> 12:04.620
Hey. Hey. Sipsey!

12:06.860 --> 12:09.260
For moose hunting, it's
kind of a tough balance.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.730
I'm walking a long ways,
and then I also have to be

12:11.760 --> 12:14.990
prepared to carry back
thousands of pounds of meat if

12:15.030 --> 12:18.800
I'm successful, so I need
to travel light and fast

12:18.830 --> 12:20.400
at the same time.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.170
I need to make sure I have
everything that I need.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.470
One last thing, gotta
make sure sipsey, hey,

12:27.510 --> 12:28.610
look at him ready to go.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.640
Sipsey.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.910
Come here.

12:31.950 --> 12:34.250
For the moose hunt,
I think it's best if

12:34.280 --> 12:35.920
I don't take sipsey.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.880
See you soon, buddy, okay?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.120
Sipsey might chase
after it, rile it up.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.890
It's just kind of
unpredictable what a

12:41.920 --> 12:44.220
dog might do.

12:44.260 --> 12:47.160
But, it's kind of scary
walking around without him.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.930
Even with a
shotgun or a rifle.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.570
Come out here
unprepared and at best,

12:53.600 --> 12:55.540
you're probably going to
have a really bad day.

12:55.570 --> 12:58.610
At worst, you could
end up dead out here,

12:58.640 --> 13:01.140
and you're really never
completely in control,

13:01.910 --> 13:04.110
so you have to keep the faith.

13:07.150 --> 13:10.550
Jessi: In town,
social media or tv or
whoever are telling you,

13:10.590 --> 13:12.450
you need to do these
certain things, like,

13:12.490 --> 13:14.850
I don't have that type
of pressure out here.

13:14.890 --> 13:16.960
I have more
dangerous pressures,

13:16.990 --> 13:20.890
but I will take
that every day over the
dangers of being in town.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.370
Chris: Whoa.
Jessi: Oh, man.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.070
Chris: Look how much this
river's come overnight.

13:32.110 --> 13:35.210
Chris: I'm thinking at least
five feet since last night.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.280
God, I bet the
net is underwater.

13:38.910 --> 13:41.780
Jessi: Holy smokes.
I mean, everything's gone.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.650
The bank's gone, where
we were standing is gone.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.190
I don't know how
we're going to be able
to find the fyke net.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.900
Jessi: As the minutes tick by,

13:56.930 --> 13:59.600
this river takes all
of the bank away.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.300
We need to find our, our net.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.240
Chris: It's a constant
battle with this river.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.570
The cosna's fed by
rainwater way upriver.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.410
We're talking 50 to 100 miles.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.480
Aw, man, love.

14:09.510 --> 14:11.040
I don't know if we
can get down there.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.880
So, if it rained
heavy three days ago,

14:12.910 --> 14:14.550
this water's going up.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.380
Okay.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.820
Jessi: What am I gonna do
if you go into the water?

14:17.850 --> 14:19.750
Chris: Just stay put.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.860
Whoa! That's deep.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.000
Okay.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.730
Just hoping I
can feel the line.

14:33.770 --> 14:34.830
But.

14:34.870 --> 14:36.300
Jessi: Be careful, love.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.500
Chris: Love, I
feel like we lost it.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.140
I found my line.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.080
Jessi: Did you?
Chris: Yeah.
Jessi: Okay.

14:42.110 --> 14:43.810
I'm mean, if the line's there,
then it's likely there's still

14:43.850 --> 14:45.080
a net there, right?

14:45.110 --> 14:47.610
Chris: Yeah. I gotta get
this net before we lose it.

14:47.650 --> 14:49.380
Whew! Holy (bleep)!

14:49.450 --> 14:51.990
That's cold.

14:53.150 --> 14:55.490
Jessi: Big log
coming your way.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.860
Chris: I got it.
Jessi: You go it?

14:56.890 --> 14:58.520
Chris: Let's see if I
can get it outta here.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.730
All right.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.030
Jessi: Well?
Chris: Nothing.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.070
Jessi: Nada.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.600
Chris: Look where it's tied.
Jessi: Way down there?

15:09.640 --> 15:13.210
Chris: Yeah.
I was worried we lost the net.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.110
I'm not so bummed I
didn't catch a fish.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.410
I mean, I would love to catch
a fish but losing the net

15:17.450 --> 15:20.050
would have really sucked.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.950
Just cause the fyke
net didn't work today,

15:21.980 --> 15:23.880
doesn't mean we're giving up.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.420
Jessi: I got it.
It's in my hands.

15:26.450 --> 15:28.660
Chris: We gotta get
fish for this winter.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.390
Alex: I don't like
depending on a complex system,

15:34.430 --> 15:37.360
it's like if someone else fails
on the other side of the world,

15:37.400 --> 15:40.400
it'll make it
hard for me to live.

15:41.170 --> 15:42.970
Self-reliance is one of
the most important values we

15:43.000 --> 15:44.800
should try to honor.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.270
I'm not trying
to die out here,

15:46.310 --> 15:49.140
I'm trying to stay alive.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.180
Today I'm doing a reconnaissance
of the north area.

15:53.210 --> 15:56.280
For a new place to hunt moose.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.920
This is as far as
I've been to the north.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.390
Before I left, I
studied a topographic map.

16:05.430 --> 16:08.490
Found some satellite
photos of the area,

16:08.530 --> 16:10.000
you know, you should
have a big, nice,

16:10.030 --> 16:12.130
open clearing up here,
where I can see for

16:12.170 --> 16:15.130
potentially hundreds of miles.

16:15.170 --> 16:18.270
But this kind of forest, it's
kind of the toughest (bleep)

16:18.310 --> 16:20.410
alaska has to offer.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.480
It's a doozy.

16:22.510 --> 16:25.680
But I just gotta
trust my compass.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.310
I know that if I
head 280 degrees,

16:28.350 --> 16:31.650
I'm going to be
heading the right direction.

16:33.760 --> 16:38.990
Hmm. I don't know.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.930
It's no country
for a bull moose.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.570
It looks like there
was an apocalypse here.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.300
I think this is maybe what I
thought was the clearing on

16:49.340 --> 16:52.410
the satellite images.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.210
I thought that was tundra.

16:55.240 --> 17:00.550
This is the remains
of a forest fire.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.150
This is the opposite of
what I wanted to find.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.920
As far as I can see,
there's just these dead,

17:06.960 --> 17:10.160
kinda gnarled trees.

17:11.490 --> 17:15.090
So, you can see here the ash
on the trees where they burned.

17:15.130 --> 17:18.700
So, the forest fire, you know,
obviously destroyed everything.

17:18.730 --> 17:23.100
But it created just
the right conditions
for these blueberries.

17:23.140 --> 17:27.010
Um, and they're really good.

17:27.040 --> 17:32.350
So, I'm glad I wasn't here
when there was a forest fire.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.680
That was probably
pretty terrifying,

17:34.720 --> 17:38.220
but it created
something new and good.

17:39.420 --> 17:43.320
This is the kind of
thing that I really enjoy
about being out here.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.860
The simple pleasures.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.290
They're good, but there's
really no point to try and

17:48.330 --> 17:50.230
hunt up here.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.800
I don't think animals like
to come through this

17:51.830 --> 17:55.230
any more than I do.

17:57.010 --> 18:00.410
Is that a
sandhill crane yakking?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.010
Oh, yeah, look,
look, look, look!

18:02.040 --> 18:04.610
They're really close.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.410
Tomorrow, I've only got
one place left to hunt.

18:07.450 --> 18:11.320
It's not a great spot, but
it's pretty much my last shot.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.220
That's pretty cool.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.750
I've never seen
them so low down.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.820
Usually, they're really high.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.090
They should be going
south for the winter,

18:18.130 --> 18:19.530
they're kind of
heading east right now,

18:19.560 --> 18:22.700
but I'm sure they know
where they're going.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.770
It's gonna be a lot of
work to find a moose.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.870
(imitating moose call).

18:31.910 --> 18:33.770
Michael: Just like
the river of life,

18:33.810 --> 18:36.780
you never know
what's around the bend.

18:36.810 --> 18:40.110
And that to me is
an addictive thing.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.890
Your ears are stinging.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.790
And the wind's going through
whatever you're wearing,

18:51.830 --> 18:53.790
your nose starts running.

18:53.830 --> 18:56.400
Just deal with it.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.900
My, oh my.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.830
It's a bit on the
noisy side, this river.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.900
I'm not seeing a
lot of moose tracks, so.

19:03.940 --> 19:07.970
I think these moose stay up
right near the major creek.

19:08.010 --> 19:11.510
Hard luck creek.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.210
It's quieter and they
find little kettle ponds,

19:14.250 --> 19:17.280
and little moose pastures
where they can hang out.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.120
I just have to see new
rivers all the time.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.090
I can't stop.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.920
This ain't even a
river, this is a creek.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.590
Getting shallow.

19:27.630 --> 19:31.300
Gonna go ahead and
jump out right here.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.510
This is in my blood.

19:39.540 --> 19:43.280
Challenging.

19:47.550 --> 19:51.050
Let's get it on.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.950
And maybe a moose as well.

19:57.790 --> 20:01.890
That what's around the
bend mentality is kicking in.

20:02.700 --> 20:06.800
But I don't want to push my
luck too much on a creek named

20:06.830 --> 20:10.540
"hard luck."

20:10.570 --> 20:13.840
and I think I've
gone far enough.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.890
This river valley is
a corridor for moose.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.200
So, what I'd like to do, is I
like to throw out a cow call

20:37.230 --> 20:38.530
in one direction.

20:38.570 --> 20:44.700
(imitating moose call).

20:45.840 --> 20:49.040
And I like to throw out
a bull tending run in
a different direction.

20:49.080 --> 20:55.310
(imitating moose call).

20:59.590 --> 21:03.620
Everything increases
your odds when you're
throwing out calls.

21:03.660 --> 21:06.390
But look at that sun.

21:06.430 --> 21:09.000
Low in the sky.

21:09.030 --> 21:12.200
Time to get home.
It's been a long day.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.640
Going downstream with
the current pushing you,

21:20.680 --> 21:26.150
sometimes it pushes
you into something that
you don't want to go down.

21:26.180 --> 21:30.080
And it's harder to
judge where the rocks are.

21:36.860 --> 21:41.660
Gotta really be on your game
when you're going down river.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.930
As good as you
can be, anyways.

21:49.070 --> 21:51.900
I didn't even see that.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.780
Yup.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.290
Whew.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.060
(bleep) this creek.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.130
Jesus (bleep).

22:30.480 --> 22:34.410
Too much of a turn
with a 22-foot boat.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.850
Every day that I stay out
here later into the season,

22:39.890 --> 22:43.020
it's quite the risk
pushing moose meat.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.760
These motors don't like running
around in really cold weather.

22:47.460 --> 22:49.930
I'm gonna feel that.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.530
Hard luck.

22:55.940 --> 22:59.770
So, I've got maybe at most
two days of hunting left,

22:59.810 --> 23:02.580
and then I gotta
get off this river.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.220
Brittany: I refer to my
children as free-range children.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.490
Elovie: Ahh!

23:14.520 --> 23:16.190
Brittany: It's
exactly how that sounds.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.620
I let them roam
around our property,

23:18.660 --> 23:21.260
as opposed to if we
lived in the city.

23:24.930 --> 23:26.170
All right, little ones.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.340
We need to decide how big the
hole should be for the rabbits

23:29.370 --> 23:32.610
to hop through to
their nesting box.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.780
If I lift this up,
this is how tall it is.

23:35.810 --> 23:36.880
This is two feet.

23:36.910 --> 23:38.310
Elovie: Yeah. Uh-huh.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.710
Brittany: Like.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.750
Gilbert: No, that,
no, that's too small.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.280
Brittany: Maybe
up to this one?

23:43.320 --> 23:44.880
Gilbert: Yeah, up there.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.190
Brittany: All right, you
have to come over here,

23:46.220 --> 23:48.790
and I need you
guys to sit on these.

23:48.820 --> 23:49.990
You guys are my helpers.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.260
Hold your ears.

23:51.290 --> 23:52.390
Elovie: Like this?

23:52.430 --> 23:53.660
Brittany: Yeah. Both hands.

23:53.690 --> 23:56.660
Gilbert. Both hands.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.530
It's a lot of fun to
have the kids around.

23:59.570 --> 24:02.170
I really do love them,
and I really do enjoy it.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.070
And I love that they are
capable of helping me,

24:05.110 --> 24:08.510
even if it's not
exactly how I want it to go.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.380
Elovie: Yay!
A little door!

24:13.650 --> 24:16.050
Brittany: Ellie, can
you hold that end?

24:16.080 --> 24:19.350
I'm trying to push
it, can you pull it?

24:19.390 --> 24:22.120
There we go.
That's not too bad.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.890
Elovie: Not too bad!

24:23.930 --> 24:26.230
Brittany: As any mother knows,
it is really hard to get

24:26.260 --> 24:28.490
anything done
with the children.

24:28.530 --> 24:30.130
Gilbert: Drill holes!

24:30.160 --> 24:31.900
Brittany: No.
You may not drill holes.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.130
Hand me the screws.

24:35.070 --> 24:37.470
Even if they sometimes
actually hinders things.

24:37.510 --> 24:40.970
Elovie: Yay!
Brittany: Too loud.

24:41.010 --> 24:43.880
It's a lot of fun
to have them help.

24:43.910 --> 24:47.050
This is how you get
projects done as a mother.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.650
A little bit of time here, and
I little bit of time there, and

24:49.680 --> 24:51.950
"oh, they're
hungry again?"

24:51.990 --> 24:53.920
kaleb: Do you need a hand?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.990
Brittany: So, this is
just shimmied a little bit,

24:56.020 --> 24:57.720
can you square it
up there so that.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.090
Kaleb: Yup.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.260
Brittany: Excellent.
Tell me when.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.330
Kaleb: Okay, you
can screw it in.

25:02.360 --> 25:03.860
Don't hit my fingers.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.400
Brittany: No promises!

25:06.430 --> 25:08.670
I hope these rabbits
appreciate everything that

25:08.700 --> 25:10.800
we're doing for them.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.810
And they give us lots
and lots of babies!

25:12.840 --> 25:16.780
Elovie: Whee!
Brittany: And that is done.

25:16.810 --> 25:18.180
Kaleb: I like it.

25:18.210 --> 25:20.280
Brittany: Thank you.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.080
Kaleb: Gilbert!
Brittany: Ugh.

25:26.550 --> 25:30.520
Alex: I know that I really
value challenges, even
though you totally regret it

25:30.560 --> 25:32.830
and you swear you'll
never do it again.

25:32.860 --> 25:35.490
Uh, but somehow I just keep
doing stuff like this.

25:35.530 --> 25:37.900
Uh, it's just my life.

25:43.340 --> 25:47.970
Today's my last shot, but
I've recon to north, west, east.

25:48.010 --> 25:49.740
No good hunting areas.

25:49.780 --> 25:53.680
And now's my last shot in the
south to be able to find moose.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.680
Not too many
people do it like this.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.490
I imagine that's why most
hunters stick to places they

25:59.520 --> 26:01.790
can get to with the vehicles.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.720
I was really hoping
this year I'd find a

26:03.760 --> 26:05.860
better place to hunt.

26:05.890 --> 26:08.990
I was hoping to find
some ideal location.

26:09.030 --> 26:11.260
I didn't find anything.

26:11.300 --> 26:15.230
So, best I can do is return to
my usual stomping grounds and

26:15.270 --> 26:18.100
give it one last hail mary.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.110
I'm going to leave my backpack
here and just basically try to

26:25.150 --> 26:29.150
get up to the top of that
hill before I call it quits.

26:29.180 --> 26:31.520
I just want to get a
good look down this valley,

26:31.550 --> 26:34.820
make sure that I'm not missing
something before I head back.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.990
Once I get into
that thick forest,

26:37.020 --> 26:38.560
it's real easy to
get turned around,

26:38.590 --> 26:40.830
so I'm just going to
hang this coat up.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.330
I don't want to give up yet,
I need to be a little bit

26:43.360 --> 26:45.460
stubborn here, and
when I come back,

26:45.500 --> 26:48.000
I don't want to waste another
hour trying to figure out

26:48.040 --> 26:50.200
where I put my stuff, kind
of like writing a checklist

26:50.240 --> 26:53.270
before you go to
the grocery store.

26:53.310 --> 26:56.080
Something to
save you some time.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.310
Of course, you won't get lost
for hours in the grocery store

26:59.350 --> 27:04.720
and want to kill yourself,
but kinda same idea.

27:05.850 --> 27:07.050
That's about it.

27:07.090 --> 27:09.150
Those trees are
kinda in my way.

27:09.190 --> 27:11.760
I'm not gonna climb a
tree, that's crazy.

27:11.790 --> 27:15.030
I think this is about the
best view I'm gonna get.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.400
This is pretty much the
end of the ridgeline.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.470
Take a look on my
binoculars to be sure.

27:25.040 --> 27:28.140
As far as I can see,
black spruce trees.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.810
Basically, a wasteland.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.080
Moose, they don't like
thick woods like this.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.610
It's pretty safe to say
this is a place I can

27:34.650 --> 27:37.680
scratch off the list.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.690
That doesn't really bode
well for me if I want to kinda

27:39.720 --> 27:41.890
consistently get
moose every year.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.090
I might have to look into
traveling somewhere else.

27:45.760 --> 27:49.900
I had high hopes,
they were shot down.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.570
Of course, even
though I don't expect to,

27:53.600 --> 27:55.230
you know, there's some chance
I could bump into a moose

27:55.270 --> 27:56.240
along the way.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.500
That's always a possibility.

27:58.540 --> 28:01.770
So, I need to keep my
eyes and ears tuned in.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.880
You know, I don't want
to just be staring at
my feet in front of me.

28:17.090 --> 28:19.390
There's one.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.990
Right in the middle of the
tree, about halfway up.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.330
There's a grouse.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.430
Usually, if you see one,
there's always going to be a

28:27.470 --> 28:29.740
second one nearby.

28:29.770 --> 28:31.770
So, I'm going to
go real quiet.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.070
If I can get a
couple of grouse,

28:33.110 --> 28:35.770
tonight won't feel
like such a failure.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.050
Threw my earphones off
just because I want to hear,

28:41.080 --> 28:44.080
you know, in case they move...

28:44.120 --> 28:45.880
Talking.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.930
(gunshot).

29:12.750 --> 29:16.520
(gunshots).

29:19.190 --> 29:21.320
Ahh, I hope that
one didn't get stuck.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.290
But I don't know if
the first one came down.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.520
Oh, he did.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.430
They're both down.
Okay. Nice.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.300
It's no moose, but, you know,
it still kind of gives you a

29:31.330 --> 29:33.130
little dopamine kick.

29:33.170 --> 29:35.600
A lot of
high-quality protein there.

29:36.300 --> 29:39.540
They were relying
on the camouflage so
I wouldn't see them.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.870
You know, their camouflage
works great for other predators,

29:41.910 --> 29:45.610
it's not much use against a
man with a shotgun, of course.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.610
This is, kind of
on a larger scale,

29:48.650 --> 29:51.150
a little bit disappointing,
because I came out here

29:51.190 --> 29:54.350
looking for an entire
winter's worth of meat.

29:54.390 --> 29:56.960
More importantly, I didn't
find a good moose hunting area.

29:57.890 --> 30:03.130
But, one night of dinner is
better than zero nights.

30:05.030 --> 30:07.930
Mostly, I'm just thinking
about putting on some dry socks.

30:12.770 --> 30:16.070
(imitating moose call).

30:16.110 --> 30:17.980
Michael: If I come out
of here empty-handed,

30:18.010 --> 30:20.010
I won't regret it.

30:20.050 --> 30:21.780
I'm here for the challenge.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.380
I'm not here for an easy way.

30:26.790 --> 30:30.090
My last day of the
hunt is tomorrow.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.790
I've been going at this
for a good long while.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.490
I've put away a lot of moose
in my time and I've hunted a

30:35.530 --> 30:39.130
lot of places, but this is the
most sparse I've ever hunted.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.290
It's one of the biggest-bodied
cows I've ever seen.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.560
Literally looked like a
bull moose with no antlers.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.570
That's a big hoof for a cow.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.500
Look!

31:18.540 --> 31:22.070
There's the bed right here.

31:22.110 --> 31:25.440
Where there's a cow,
there could be a bull.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.750
It's where they bed down.

31:28.780 --> 31:32.020
They're in estrus right now,
it'll drive bulls to them.

31:32.050 --> 31:34.620
So, I'm gonna camp here.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.660
(imitating moose call).

31:38.690 --> 31:42.960
Just below this bend right
here is the bedding area for

31:43.000 --> 31:46.600
the first moose I've
seen all trip long.

31:47.030 --> 31:51.140
A lot of tracks through
here, cows with calves.

31:51.170 --> 31:54.770
That tells me
there's a bull close by.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.240
I'm gonna stay right on a cot.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.350
I'm not even gonna
sleep in a tent.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.150
Don't even wanna have a tarp.

32:02.180 --> 32:04.820
I just wanna be dialed
into my surroundings.

32:04.850 --> 32:09.590
If something comes in,
I got my rifle right here.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.160
If it rains tonight,
I don't give a crap.

32:13.190 --> 32:16.860
I'm as close as
I'm ever gonna get.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.770
(imitating moose call).

32:20.800 --> 32:24.600
To be sleeping here, stopped
at many place as I have,

32:24.640 --> 32:29.170
hiked as many miles as I have,
without seeing a bull moose,

32:29.210 --> 32:32.310
kind of makes me
question myself.

32:33.750 --> 32:37.280
Am I crazy?
What am I doing?

32:37.320 --> 32:39.420
I'm getting down to
the crunch time here.

32:39.450 --> 32:42.750
Tomorrow's gonna be big time,
my last-ditch effort to come

32:42.790 --> 32:45.760
out of here with a moose.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.800
Chris: You're always fighting
against mother nature.

32:56.840 --> 33:00.070
And honestly, mother
nature always wins.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.980
So, we just have to find
our niche and chase after it.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.350
That's perfect.

33:10.380 --> 33:13.390
Currently the river is down,
so we think it's a good time

33:13.420 --> 33:15.350
to get the net in the water.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.460
Look at that.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.320
We got a slow-moving eddy
that goes through here,

33:18.360 --> 33:20.560
so hopefully we get this
set out just right and we can

33:20.590 --> 33:22.690
catch some fish with it.

33:22.730 --> 33:26.100
Jessi: All right, well,
we're gonna have to do
something here, love.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.430
Chris: Yeah,
fishing's just been a bust.

33:28.470 --> 33:32.240
But cosna has different
plans for us this year.

33:32.270 --> 33:34.470
We got a long
winter ahead of us.

33:34.510 --> 33:36.310
Right now, I wanna
focus on grouse.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.010
I've been hearing 'em.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.680
Let's get em!

33:40.710 --> 33:42.780
The cosna river really hasn't
been generous with giving us

33:42.820 --> 33:44.420
fish this year.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.720
But luckily the grouse
are back in full force.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.390
I love this little
spot across the river.

33:49.420 --> 33:51.320
There's just little
tiny pebbles and sand,

33:51.360 --> 33:53.360
and those birds love
munching down on it.

33:53.390 --> 33:56.700
Helps them digest their food.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.560
Jessi: There's six
grouse are across the river.

33:58.600 --> 34:01.400
You can throw
something or shoot over there.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.570
And they'll usually fly
over the river towards you.

34:16.150 --> 34:19.080
They're in the tree.
They're over.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.920
Jessi: Four grouse just flew
over the river and they're

34:21.960 --> 34:24.390
right up here in these trees.

34:25.530 --> 34:26.830
Chris: I see one.

34:26.860 --> 34:28.990
Right here on this
branch sticking out
between the two birch.

34:29.030 --> 34:32.400
He's kinda hidden.

34:32.430 --> 34:34.030
(gunshot).

34:34.070 --> 34:36.840
Get 'em, jess!

34:37.440 --> 34:38.400
Jessi: No, don't
go in the river!

34:38.440 --> 34:40.870
Don't go in the river!

34:40.910 --> 34:43.680
Damn it!

34:43.710 --> 34:45.840
What am I gonna do, chris?

34:49.920 --> 34:53.050
Chris: (bleep). (bleep).

34:54.120 --> 34:55.850
Get me a stick.

34:55.890 --> 34:57.460
Quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick!
I'm gonna lose him!

34:57.490 --> 34:58.720
Jessi: I can't get
down there, chris.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.690
Chris: I can.

35:00.730 --> 35:03.730
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

35:04.630 --> 35:07.330
I got him.
I got him.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.370
Jessi: Holy smokes!

35:13.410 --> 35:15.940
Chris: There's nothing worse
than killing a grouse and

35:15.980 --> 35:18.040
watching it float down river.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.640
Jessi: I'm right here.
I'll help you up.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.610
Chris: We're real big into
"if you kill something or you

35:21.650 --> 35:23.820
wound something you have to
do everything in your power to

35:23.850 --> 35:26.080
harvest that animal."

35:26.120 --> 35:28.890
just take the grouse
so it doesn't fall.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.260
I'll work my way up down-river.

35:32.290 --> 35:35.060
Give me a second.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.930
Jessi: That was a
difficult grouse, man.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.270
Try to go get some more.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.810
Chris: Did they all fly off?
Jessi: I'm looking.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.210
I don't think.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.410
Chris: I bet they're
still in the tree.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.480
Jessi: I bet
they're still here.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.580
Chris: Oh, that feels
good to get a grouse.

35:56.620 --> 36:00.150
We've been having such
a hard time with fish.

36:00.190 --> 36:01.450
Jessi: Oh!
Right here, chris.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.890
Come here! Come here! Come here!

36:03.920 --> 36:08.090
There's a spruce and
he's almost at the top.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.260
Chris: Okay, I see him.

36:10.300 --> 36:13.730
Jessi: Okay, I'm gonna
get ready so this
doesn't happen again.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.670
(gunshot).

36:18.840 --> 36:20.340
Chris: Pop in
the wide clearing.

36:20.370 --> 36:23.010
Make sure this goes
in nice and tight.

36:24.210 --> 36:26.680
Jessi: Thank you so much.

36:29.880 --> 36:30.950
Thank you, grouse.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.950
Thank you.
That's a big grouse.

36:33.990 --> 36:37.220
That is a huge grouse, man.

36:37.260 --> 36:38.560
Chris: Awesome.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.390
If we can eat
one grouse a day,

36:40.430 --> 36:41.630
and we're only
bringing one or two home,

36:41.660 --> 36:43.500
we're not stocking up much.

We gotta come out morning and
night and get as many as we can.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.400
Jessi: Try to
get a couple more?

36:48.440 --> 36:50.940
Chris: Yeah, that'd be
great if we get a couple more.

36:50.970 --> 36:53.540
Jessi: Out here, it does seem
like we have to work a lot

36:53.570 --> 36:55.840
harder for our dinner.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.010
But do I want to pay
the price in town?

36:58.050 --> 36:59.640
No.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.550
Do I wanna pay
the price out here?

37:01.580 --> 37:03.010
Absolutely.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.820
There's a grouse,
right over there.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.480
Him go left and me go right.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.090
We gotta do
everything that we can...

37:08.120 --> 37:09.820
Gosh darn it!

37:09.860 --> 37:12.390
To get as many grouse as
possible to sustain us through

37:12.430 --> 37:14.460
this winter.

37:14.490 --> 37:17.060

of the most challenging moose

37:27.710 --> 37:30.380

This is the last
day of the hunt.

nervous about filling my food

cache for the season.

37:46.860 --> 37:50.500
Woke up all night
from a cold rain.

37:50.530 --> 37:54.570
I sent out calls
every hour or so.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.840

37:58.870 --> 38:02.010
Just right there

with my rifle
right next to me.

I can't tell if my ears are
playing tricks on me or not.

38:20.830 --> 38:24.060
And then finally, the
moose I had been waiting for.

38:27.270 --> 38:30.070
Tricked this big
fighter into a fight.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.340
(imitating moose call).

38:33.370 --> 38:36.780

big this moose was.

Couldn't quite tell
'cause it was so dark.

41:36.690 --> 41:39.660

barreling in here,

41:39.690 --> 41:42.090
scraping brush.
