04:03.125 --> 04:05.125
Shoot.  God!

04:10.583 --> 04:13.166
Hello! Oh, Jesus Christ!

04:13.250 --> 04:16.500
Listen, what do you recommend
for a catatonic fit in a parking garage?

04:16.583 --> 04:18.708
I… Ugh, ask your doctor.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.875
<i>That's why I'm calling. He just canceled. </i>

04:20.958 --> 04:22.208
Can I come over?

04:22.291 --> 04:24.416
Donald, you're about
a day and a half early.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.333
<i>-What am I supposed to do?</i>
-I just got in.

04:26.416 --> 04:28.916
I'm not ready for you yet.
Why did the prick cancel?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.750
I don't know.
He said he was just too sick.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.791
<i>Why don't you tell him</i>
<i>you're sicker than he is?</i>

04:32.875 --> 04:34.083
He already knows that.

04:34.166 --> 04:37.458
Okay, Donald, come on over,
but bring a bag of ice.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.375
<i>Please do not give me any responsibility.</i>

04:39.458 --> 04:41.458
At this moment, I cannot cope
with anything weightier

04:41.541 --> 04:43.083
than the directions to your apartment.

04:43.166 --> 04:46.083
<i>If you want a cold martini when</i>
<i>you get here, you'll cope with some ice.</i>

04:46.166 --> 04:48.333
-I'll cope with some ice.
-And hurry up.

05:07.791 --> 05:09.500
I gotta go.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.833
I was saying hello to an old friend.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.000
What?

05:28.250 --> 05:29.958
10th and Broadway, please.

06:13.958 --> 06:17.250
Coming! Jesus Christ.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.583
-How did you get inside?
-The street door was open.

06:25.666 --> 06:28.416
-You want a drink?
-Not until I've had my shower.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.125
I want something to work out today.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.083
I'm gonna try to relax
and enjoy something.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.125
You in a blue funk because of the doctor?

06:48.208 --> 06:52.166
Christ, no.
I was depressed long before I got there.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.583
This should pick you up.

06:53.666 --> 06:59.125
I went shopping today,
and I bought all sorts of goodies. Look.

06:59.958 --> 07:02.375
-Sandalwood soap.
-I feel better already.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.541
-Mm-hmm.
-What we got here?

07:03.625 --> 07:05.916
Oh! Your very own toothbrush,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.125
because I am sick to death
of you using mine.

07:08.208 --> 07:11.458
-How do you think I feel?
-You've had worse things in your mouth.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.333
Oh, also for you,
something called "Control."

07:15.416 --> 07:17.333
Notice nowhere is it called "hairspray."

07:17.416 --> 07:20.375
Just simply "Control"
and the words "for men"

07:20.458 --> 07:23.416
written about 37 times
all over the goddamn can.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.416
Yeah, it's called Butch Assurance.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.583
Well, it's still hairspray,
no matter if they call it "balls."

07:28.666 --> 07:30.291
It's all on your very own shelf,

07:30.375 --> 07:33.458
which is to be labeled
Donald's Saturday Night Douche Kit.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.083
By the way, are you spending the night?

07:42.791 --> 07:45.541
Nope, I'm driving back.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.791
I still get very itchy
when I'm in this town too long.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.666
Why didn't the prick call you and cancel?

07:50.750 --> 07:52.583
Suppose you'd driven
all this way for nothing?

07:52.666 --> 07:54.333
Why do you keep calling him a prick?

07:54.416 --> 07:55.500
Who ever heard of an analyst

07:55.583 --> 07:58.625
having a session with a patient
for two hours on a Saturday evening?

07:58.708 --> 08:01.500
He simply prefers to take Mondays off.

08:01.583 --> 08:04.458
He works late on Saturday
taking Monday off?

08:04.541 --> 08:07.250
What is he,
a psychiatrist or a hairdresser?

08:07.333 --> 08:08.666
Actually, he's both.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.083
He shrinks my head and then combs me out.

08:11.166 --> 08:15.416
Besides, I had to come in town
for a birthday party anyway, right?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.333
Oh, you had to remind me.

08:17.416 --> 08:19.625
God, if there is one thing
I'm not ready for,

08:19.708 --> 08:22.750
it is five screaming queens
singing "Happy Birthday."

08:22.833 --> 08:25.791
-Who's coming?
-I think you know everybody anyway.

08:25.875 --> 08:29.833
I mean, the same old tired fairies
you've seen around since day one.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
Actually, you know what?

08:31.583 --> 08:34.416
There will be seven,
counting Harold and you and me.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.083
Are you calling me
a screaming queen or a tired fairy?

08:37.166 --> 08:38.500
Oh, I beg your pardon.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.250
There will be six tired,
screaming fairy queens

08:41.333 --> 08:42.750
and one anxious queer.

08:43.833 --> 08:47.583
I'll be out of your way in a second.
I've only got one more thing to do.

08:47.666 --> 08:50.125
Surgery? So early in the evening?

08:50.208 --> 08:51.416
Sunt.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.708
-That's French with a cedilla.

08:53.791 --> 08:57.083
I've got to comb my hair
for the 37th time.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.041
Hair, that's singular.

08:59.125 --> 09:03.208
My hair, without exaggeration,
is clearly falling on the floor.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.791
You're totally paranoid.
You've got plenty of hair.

09:05.875 --> 09:09.916
No, what you see before you
is a masterpiece of deception.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.166
My hairline starts about here.

09:12.833 --> 09:15.375
All this is just tortured forward.

09:16.125 --> 09:16.958
Look.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.958
That's not good, huh?

09:20.916 --> 09:22.333
It's not the greatest.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.750
- It's called getting old.

09:28.958 --> 09:33.041
Oh, well.
One thing you can say for masturbation:

09:33.125 --> 09:35.250
you certainly don't have
to look your best.

09:36.291 --> 09:40.375
So what are you so depressed about?
I mean, other than the usual everything?

09:40.958 --> 09:43.708
I really don't want to get into it.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.375
Well, Donald,
if you're not going to tell me,

09:46.458 --> 09:48.833
then how can we have
a conversation in depth?

09:48.916 --> 09:51.541
A warm, rewarding, meaningful friendship.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.833
Up yours.

09:53.625 --> 09:58.125
It's just that today I finally realized
I was raised to be a failure.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.500
I was groomed for it.

09:59.583 --> 10:03.041
Oh, Christ. How sick analysts must get

10:03.125 --> 10:06.375
of hearing how Mommy and Daddy
made their darlin' into a fairy.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.708
It's beyond just that now.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.291
Today I finally began to see

10:10.375 --> 10:12.833
how some of the other pieces
of the puzzle relate to them.

10:13.416 --> 10:16.250
My neurotic compulsion to not succeed.

10:17.500 --> 10:21.250
I realize it was always when I failed
that Evelyn loved me the most.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.291
Because it displeased Walt,
who wanted perfection.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.333
I began to fail on purpose to get love.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.875
Failure is the only thing
with which I feel at home

10:34.958 --> 10:36.583
because it's what I was taught at home.

10:37.875 --> 10:38.833
No.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.291
<i>♪ You better chase all the blues away ♪</i>

10:42.375 --> 10:44.041
<i>♪ Shout hallelujah, come on… ♪</i>

10:45.791 --> 10:49.375
What is more boring than a queen
doing a Judy Garland imitation?

10:49.458 --> 10:51.750
A queen doing a Bette Davis imitation.

10:52.750 --> 10:53.916
Where'd you get that sweater?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.458
Oh, this clever little shop
on the Right Bank called Hermès.

10:57.541 --> 10:58.833
I work my ass off

10:58.916 --> 11:02.000
for 45 lousy dollars a week,
scrubbing floors,

11:02.083 --> 11:06.000
and you waltz around
throwing cashmere sweaters on them.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.875
The one on the floor
in the john is vicuña.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.875
Oh, I beg your pardon.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.833
You could get a job doing something else.

11:11.916 --> 11:15.000
Nobody holds a gun to your head
to be a charwoman.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.041
That is, how you say, your neurosis.

11:17.125 --> 11:19.458
Gee, and I thought it's why I was born.

11:19.541 --> 11:22.625
Besides, just because
I wear expensive clothes,

11:22.708 --> 11:24.291
doesn't mean they're paid for.

11:24.375 --> 11:27.708
That is, how you say, your neurosis.

11:28.333 --> 11:32.166
However, thanks to the silver screen,
your neurosis has got style.

11:32.250 --> 11:37.000
It takes a certain flair to squander
one's unemployment check at Joe Allen.

11:37.791 --> 11:40.916
What's so snappy
about being head over heels in debt?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.416
The only thing smart about it

11:42.500 --> 11:45.833
is the ingenious ways
I dodge the bill collectors.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.000
Yep, come to think of it,

11:48.708 --> 11:51.416
you're the type
that gives faggots a bad name.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.625
Oh, and you, Donald,
you are a credit to the homosexual.

11:54.708 --> 11:58.958
You're a reliable, hard-working,
floor-scrubbing, bill-paying fag

11:59.041 --> 12:00.583
who don't owe nothing to nobody.

12:00.666 --> 12:03.208
-I am a model fairy.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.833
You think it's just nifty

12:04.916 --> 12:11.250
how I've always flitted from Beverly Hills
to Rome to Acapulco to Amsterdam,

12:11.333 --> 12:13.541
picking up a lot of one-night stands,

12:13.625 --> 12:16.083
a lot of custom-made duds along the trail?

12:16.708 --> 12:20.125
I'm here to tell you
the only place in all those miles,

12:20.875 --> 12:25.000
the only place that I've ever been happy
was on the goddamn plane.

12:26.416 --> 12:28.375
Run, charge.

12:28.458 --> 12:32.541
Run, buy, borrow, make, spend.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.708
Run, squander, beg.

12:35.791 --> 12:39.916
Run, run, run. Waste, waste…

12:40.750 --> 12:41.833
waste.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.333
And why?

12:53.500 --> 12:54.958
<i>Finis.</i> Applause.

12:59.791 --> 13:02.000
-Hey.
-Don't. You don't have to.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.208
Hey, come on.

13:06.750 --> 13:10.250
Oh, there's nothing quite as good
as feeling sorry for yourself, is there?

13:10.333 --> 13:11.333
Nothing.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.208
Okay.

13:17.916 --> 13:20.666
I adore cheap sentiment.

13:57.375 --> 13:59.041
Backstage, <i>Funny Girl.</i>

13:59.125 --> 14:02.041
<i>-Hi, it's Alan.</i>
-Alan?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.333
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

14:04.416 --> 14:08.000
Alan, oh, I don't believe it.
How are you? Where are you?

14:08.083 --> 14:10.916
I'm here… on business.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.041
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

14:13.125 --> 14:16.833
Oh, I'm tied up tonight.
Alan, tonight's no good for me.

14:16.916 --> 14:20.625
Oh, I'm tied up, too, but I thought
I might just drop by for a drink.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.125
What, you mean now?

14:24.208 --> 14:26.500
Well, Alan, old boy, listen to me.

14:26.583 --> 14:29.666
It is a friend's birthday,
and I am having a few people in.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.208
-Oh.
-And I'm sorry

14:31.291 --> 14:33.875
I can't ask you to join us. It's just…

14:33.958 --> 14:36.208
It just wouldn't work out,
kiddo, you know?

14:36.291 --> 14:38.583
And I'd hate to just see you
for ten minutes

14:38.666 --> 14:41.000
<i>-and then have to say goodbye.</i>
- Mickey, please?

14:42.666 --> 14:43.583

14:44.666 --> 14:46.333
<i>-Mickey?</i>
-Alan…

14:48.041 --> 14:48.875
What's wrong?

14:48.958 --> 14:50.916
I've gotta see you
about something right away.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.041
Okay, Alan, come on over.

14:56.541 --> 14:58.000
No, it's perfectly all right.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.458
Just come on over, have a quick drink,

15:00.541 --> 15:03.041
<i>-but-but hurry up.</i>
-Same old address?

15:03.125 --> 15:04.958
-Yeah.
<i>-Okay.</i>

15:10.916 --> 15:12.000
Well…

15:13.541 --> 15:14.541
am I stunning?

15:14.625 --> 15:16.166
You're absolutely stunning.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.333
You look like shit,
but I'm absolutely stunned.

15:19.416 --> 15:22.583
Your grapes are, how you say, sour.
Where's my drink?

15:22.666 --> 15:25.583
I didn't make it. My old roommate
from Georgetown just called.

15:25.666 --> 15:27.791
-Alan what's-his-name?
-McCarthy.

15:27.875 --> 15:30.500
He's up here from Washington
on business or something,

15:30.583 --> 15:31.833
and he's on his way here.

15:31.916 --> 15:34.291
I hope he knows
the lyrics to "Happy Birthday."

15:34.375 --> 15:37.916
Listen, asshole.
What am I going to do? He's straight.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.583
What'll he feel about this freak show
I've got booked for dinner?

15:41.666 --> 15:43.250
Ah, Christ, is that good.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.958
He absolutely
lost his spring on the phone.

15:46.041 --> 15:48.916
He started crying,
and that's not his style at all.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.125
Alan's so goddamned pulled together,

15:51.208 --> 15:53.541
he wouldn't show any emotion
if he were in a plane crash.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.125
What am I going to do?

15:55.208 --> 15:57.791
Are you suddenly ashamed of your friends?

15:57.875 --> 16:02.208
Donald, you are the only person I know
of whom I am truly ashamed.

16:02.291 --> 16:06.250
Some people have different standards
from yours and mine, you know?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.541
And if we don't acknowledge them,

16:08.625 --> 16:12.375
then we're just as backward
and narrow-minded as we think they are.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.958
You know what you are, Michael?
You're a real person.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.791
Thank you. Fuck you.

16:19.708 --> 16:21.000
Do you want some cracked crab?

16:21.875 --> 16:23.125
No, thanks.

16:23.208 --> 16:26.500
How could you ever have been friends
with a bore like that?

16:26.583 --> 16:29.458
Well, believe it or not,
there was a time in my life

16:29.541 --> 16:32.708
when I didn't go around
announcing that I was a faggot.

16:34.166 --> 16:37.708
That must have been
before speech replaced sign language.

16:37.791 --> 16:41.791
Don't give me any static on that score.
I didn't come out until I left college.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.291
Seems to me
that the first time we tricked,

16:44.375 --> 16:48.208
we met in a gay bar on Third Avenue
during your junior year.

16:48.291 --> 16:49.333
Cunt.

16:49.416 --> 16:50.791
Thought you'd never say it.

17:13.458 --> 17:14.583
Don't wait up.

17:18.833 --> 17:19.875
Hi, doll face.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.791
-You look cute.
-Always.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.375
-Hello, Emory.
-Hi.

17:25.208 --> 17:28.208
You know I hate coming
between the two of you like this.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.750
That makes one of us.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.750
This is gonna be fun.

17:35.916 --> 17:37.250
Oh, great.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.416
Well, that's all we need, for it to rain.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.875
-You want some more club soda?
-What?

17:41.958 --> 17:43.833
There's nothing
but club soda in that glass.

17:43.916 --> 17:46.208
I've been watching you
for several Saturdays.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.041
You've actually stopped drinking,
haven't you?

17:48.125 --> 17:49.083
And smoking, too.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.791
-How long's it been?
-Five weeks.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.000
-That's amazing.
-I found God.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.541
-It is amazing. For you?
-Or is God dead?

17:55.625 --> 17:59.000
I could always tell
when you were getting high. One way.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.208
-I'd get hostile.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.625
Hey, what made you stop? The analyst?

18:04.708 --> 18:08.041
Oh. He certainly had a lot to do with it.

18:08.125 --> 18:11.625
Mainly I didn't think I could get through
another morning-after ick attack.

18:11.708 --> 18:12.833
Morning-after what?

18:12.916 --> 18:17.666
Icks! Anxiety, guilt, unfathomable guilt.

18:18.208 --> 18:20.166
From the second
your eyes open and you say,

18:20.250 --> 18:21.958
"Oh, my God! What'd I do last night?"

18:22.041 --> 18:23.166
Mmm, tell me about it.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.125
And then that struggle
to survive till lunch…

18:26.208 --> 18:28.083
-Mmm.
-…where you have a double Bloody Mary.

18:28.166 --> 18:30.250
That is, if you've waited till lunch.

18:30.333 --> 18:34.208
And then you're half pissed again
and useless for the rest of the afternoon.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.625
So you hang on till cocktail time,

18:36.708 --> 18:39.666
and by then, you're ready
for whatever the night holds,

18:39.750 --> 18:41.625
which hopefully is another party,

18:41.708 --> 18:45.375
and that whole goddamn cycle
starts all over again.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.500
Well, I have been
on that merry-go-round long enough,

18:49.583 --> 18:53.583
and I either had to get off
or die of centrifugal force.

18:55.125 --> 18:58.125
Oh, Joe College has finally arrived.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.916
All right, Donald, listen to me.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.833
Don't insult me by giving me any lecture
on acceptable social behavior.

19:03.916 --> 19:04.875
-I promise

19:04.958 --> 19:08.041
to sit with my legs spread apart
and keep my voice in a deep register.

19:08.125 --> 19:11.416
Donald, you are a real card-carrying cunt.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.458
All right. This is a raid.

19:20.541 --> 19:23.958
Everybody's under arrest.

19:24.041 --> 19:26.833
Hello, darling. Connie Casserole.
Oh, Mary, don't ask.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.625
Hi, Emory. Come on,
you can put it in the kitchen.

19:29.708 --> 19:32.708
-Hi, Hank. Larry.
- Who is this exotic woman?

19:32.791 --> 19:34.083
My dear, I thought you had perished!

19:34.166 --> 19:36.541
Where have you been hiding
your classically chiseled features?

19:36.625 --> 19:38.208
I don't live in the city anymore.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.541
I'll take those.
Emory, where's your present?

19:40.625 --> 19:42.208
It's arriving later.

19:43.000 --> 19:43.833
Larry.

19:45.125 --> 19:47.625
Larry. Larry!

19:47.708 --> 19:49.708
-What?
-Give Michael the gift.

19:50.708 --> 19:52.750
Oh, here.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.166
Louder, so my mother
in Philadelphia can hear you.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.000
-You were standing there in a trance.
-Was I?

19:57.083 --> 20:00.208
-You both know Donald, don't you?
- Sure. Nice to see you.

20:00.291 --> 20:01.708
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

20:01.791 --> 20:03.791
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd met.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.791
Well, we haven't exactly met, but we've…

20:07.750 --> 20:09.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:10.666 --> 20:11.750
But you've what?

20:13.416 --> 20:14.875
Seen each other before.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.750
Oh, that sounds murky.

20:16.833 --> 20:18.583
You've never met,
but you've seen each other.

20:18.666 --> 20:21.833
-What was wrong with the way I said it?
-They're gonna have their first fight.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.666
The first one
since we got out of the taxi.

20:23.750 --> 20:27.708
- Where did you find this trash?
-Downstairs, leaning against a lamppost.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.250
With an orchid behind my ear

20:29.333 --> 20:31.625
and big, wet lips
painted over the lip line.

20:32.708 --> 20:35.291
-Oh! Just like Maria Montez.
-Oh, please.

20:35.375 --> 20:38.333
Hey, what have you got against Maria?
She was a good woman.

20:38.416 --> 20:39.916
Hold on. Everybody, listen.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.916
This old college friend of mine
is in town,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.750
and he's stopping by for a fast drink
on his way to dinner,

20:45.833 --> 20:47.333
but he's straight, so…

20:47.416 --> 20:51.041
Straight? If he's the one I met,
he's as straight as the yellow brick road.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.291
No, you met Justin Stuart.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.000
I don't remember meeting a Justin Stuart.

20:56.083 --> 20:59.083
-Of course you don't, dope. I met him.
-This is someone else.

20:59.166 --> 21:03.125
Yes, Alan McCarthy,
a very close total stranger.

21:03.208 --> 21:06.208
It is not that I care
what he would think of me. Really.

21:06.291 --> 21:10.125
It's just he's not ready for it,
you know, and he never will be.

21:10.916 --> 21:14.250
-You understand that, don't you, Hank?
-Sure.

21:14.333 --> 21:16.041
Do you really think
he doesn't know about you?

21:16.125 --> 21:18.875
If there is the slightest suspicion,
he's never let on.

21:18.958 --> 21:20.791
-What's he had, a lobotomy?

21:20.875 --> 21:23.958
Hey, I was super careful
when I was in college,

21:24.041 --> 21:26.083
and I still am whenever I see him.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.708
-I don't know why, but I am.
-Tilt.

21:28.791 --> 21:32.000
I was just like Alan
when I was in college.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.500
I was very large in the dating department.

21:34.583 --> 21:38.750
I wore nothing
but those constipated Ivy League clothes,

21:38.833 --> 21:41.458
and those, oh, ten-pound cordovan shoes.

21:45.958 --> 21:48.041
-No offense.
-Quite all right.

21:48.125 --> 21:52.208
I butched it up quite a bit,
and I didn't think I was lying to myself.

21:52.291 --> 21:54.291
I really thought I was straight.

21:54.375 --> 21:57.208
I know damn well I did not come out
until after I graduated.

21:57.291 --> 21:59.083
What about all those weekends
up from school?

21:59.166 --> 22:01.041
Oh. I still wasn't out.

22:01.125 --> 22:04.125
I was still in the
Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome.

22:04.208 --> 22:07.750
"Christ, I was so drunk last night,
I don't remember a thing."

22:07.833 --> 22:08.666
That's it.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.708
You were just guilty
because you were Catholic.

22:10.791 --> 22:12.375
-That's all.
-That is not true.

22:12.458 --> 22:16.583
The Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome
knows no religion,

22:16.666 --> 22:19.291
although there's a high percentage
of it among Mormons.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.541
Who do you have to fuck
to get a drink around here?

22:22.625 --> 22:24.375
Will you light somewhere?

22:24.458 --> 22:29.208
We all somehow managed
to justify our actions in those days.

22:29.291 --> 22:33.291
You know, I later found out
even Justin Stuart, my closest friend--

22:33.375 --> 22:34.500
Other than Alan McCarthy.

22:34.583 --> 22:37.375
Zip it. He was doing the same thing.

22:37.458 --> 22:40.166
Only Justin was going
to Boston on weekends.

22:40.250 --> 22:43.166
You see, in the
Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome,

22:43.250 --> 22:45.541
you really are drunk.
That part of it is true.

22:45.625 --> 22:49.416
It's just you also do remember everything.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.083
Well, a lot of guys
have to get loaded to have sex.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.375
So I've been told.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.708
Donald…

22:58.791 --> 23:00.916
…if you remember,
the first time we made it,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.625
I was so drunk I could hardly stand up.

23:03.708 --> 23:06.166
You were so drunk,
you could hardly get it up.

23:07.833 --> 23:11.791
-Christ, I was so drunk, I don't remember.
-Oh, bullshit. You remember.

23:11.875 --> 23:14.375
-Oh, Jesus. All right, that's Alan.

23:14.458 --> 23:17.958
Please, everyone do me a favor.
Cool it for the few minutes he's here.

23:18.041 --> 23:19.833
Anything for a sis, Mary.

23:19.916 --> 23:21.000
Emory, no!

23:21.083 --> 23:23.958
I'm sorry, but that is exactly
what I'm talking about.

23:24.041 --> 23:26.000
-No camping.
-Sorry.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.416
Think the Giants are gonna win
the pennant this year?

23:28.500 --> 23:30.458
-Fuckin' A, Mac.

23:31.416 --> 23:34.125
-Oh, hey, Bernard.
-Hey, baby.

23:34.208 --> 23:37.500
I'll take these. Everyone's outside.
You can put your present with the others.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.416
-Oh, it's only another queen!

23:39.500 --> 23:42.583
-And it ain't the red one either.
-It's the queen of spades!

23:42.666 --> 23:45.083
Anybody ever tell you
you'd look divine in a hammock,

23:45.166 --> 23:49.333
surrounded by louvers and ceiling fans
and lots and lots of lush tropical ferns?

23:49.416 --> 23:52.208
You're such a fag. You take the cake. Up!

23:52.291 --> 23:55.625
-What about the cake? Whose job was that?
-Mine. I ordered it to be delivered.

23:55.708 --> 23:58.000
How many candles
did you say to put on it? 80?

23:58.083 --> 24:00.916
Wait, Alan. There's too much noise.
I'll get another phone.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.500
-Michael, did the cake come?
-No.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.833
-Oh, God. Can I use your private line?
-Sure.

24:04.916 --> 24:08.375
Listen, everybody, there is some
cracked crab out there. Help yourselves.

24:08.458 --> 24:11.291
Can I have the number for the
Marseilles Bakery in Manhattan, please?

24:11.375 --> 24:13.416
-Is everybody ready for a drink?
-Yeah!

24:13.500 --> 24:16.166
Ready? I'll be your
topless cocktail waitress.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.375
Please, spare us the sight
of your sagging tits.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.666
What are you having, kids?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.666
-Is there any beer?
-Oh, in the fridge.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.291
-I'll get it.
-Beer?

24:23.375 --> 24:26.166
-Who drinks beer before dinner?
-Beer drinkers.

24:26.250 --> 24:30.625
How can a sensitive artist like you
live with an insensitive bull like that?

24:30.708 --> 24:32.541
-I can't.

24:32.625 --> 24:33.916
Well, here's hoping.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.416
Alan, don't be silly.
There's nothing to apologize for.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.583
<i>It's just that I feel like such a fool.</i>

24:40.666 --> 24:44.833
I can shoot myself
for letting myself act that way.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.833
Look, it is just as well.
I have people over.

24:47.916 --> 24:50.041
It wouldn't be a good time to talk.

24:50.125 --> 24:53.708
Hey, what about this?
What if we do lunch tomorrow?

24:53.791 --> 24:57.708
<i>Sure. Why don't you meet me</i>
<i>at the Oak Room at about one o'clock?</i>

24:57.791 --> 24:59.416
That sounds perfect.

24:59.500 --> 25:03.416
And listen, Michael,
can you just forget about tonight?

25:04.750 --> 25:06.083
Pretend it never happened?

25:06.583 --> 25:08.458
Alan, done. It's forgotten.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.333
<i>-I'll see you tomorrow?</i>
-Great.

25:18.041 --> 25:21.375
-Yeah, baby! Let's hear that sound! Whoo!

25:21.458 --> 25:24.250
A drumbeat
and their eyes sparkle like Cartier.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.333
Terrible.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.666
Wow, thanks, Bernard.

25:28.750 --> 25:30.708
It's like you stock up
for the whole summer.

25:30.791 --> 25:32.916
You kidding? That'll last him two days.

25:33.791 --> 25:36.083
-Well, he's not coming.
-Oh!

25:36.166 --> 25:38.375
Some people eat,
some people drink, some take dope.

25:38.458 --> 25:42.500
-I read.
-Yeah, and read, read, read.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.458
It's a wonder your eyes
don't turn back into your head

25:44.541 --> 25:47.875
-at the sight of a dust jacket.
-At least he's a constructive escapist.

25:47.958 --> 25:51.500
Oh, that's true.
What do I do? I take planes.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.208
No. No, I don't do that anymore

25:53.291 --> 25:56.250
because I don't have
the money to do that anymore.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.750
I go to the baths. That's about it.

25:58.833 --> 26:01.333
I'm about to do both.
I'm flying to the West Coast.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.416
You still got that act
with the donkey in Tijuana?

26:04.541 --> 26:07.708
I'm going to San Francisco
on a well-earned vacation.

26:07.791 --> 26:08.875
I'm going to the Club Baths,

26:08.958 --> 26:13.333
and I'm not leaving till they announce
the departure of TWA one week later.

26:13.416 --> 26:15.333
You'll never learn
to stay out of the baths, will you?

26:15.416 --> 26:18.208
-Bernard, don't… Bernard!
-The last time Emily took the vapors,

26:18.291 --> 26:20.916
this big hairy number strolled in.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.791
So Emory says, "I'm just resting."

26:22.875 --> 26:25.875
Big hairy number said,
"Oh, I'm just arresting."

26:25.958 --> 26:27.708
-It was the vice.
-Emory!

26:27.791 --> 26:30.625
You have to tell everything,
don't you? Thanks, honey.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.583
You live with your parents?

26:33.291 --> 26:35.250
Yeah, but it's all right, they're gay.

26:38.958 --> 26:40.541
Thought that was funny, Hank?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.375
What happened to Alan?

26:47.458 --> 26:52.000
Oh, he suddenly got terrible icks
about having broken down on the phone.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.375
Kept apologizing over and over.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.291
Did this big about-face,

26:56.375 --> 27:00.250
reverted to the old Alan
right before my very eyes.

27:00.333 --> 27:02.166
-Ears.
-Ears.

27:02.250 --> 27:05.208
Well, the cracked crab
obviously did not work out.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.291
I don't know why everyone
has such an aversion to it.

27:07.375 --> 27:10.291
Sometimes you remind me
of the Chinese water torture.

27:10.916 --> 27:12.583
No. No, I take that back.

27:12.666 --> 27:16.375
Sometimes you remind me
of the relentless Chinese water torture.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.708
-Bitch.
- Whoo! Whoo!

27:20.500 --> 27:23.625
- Wonder where Harold is.
-Yeah, where is the frozen fruit?

27:24.208 --> 27:26.208
Emory refers to Harold as the frozen fruit

27:26.291 --> 27:28.833
because of his former profession
as an ice skater.

27:28.916 --> 27:30.208
Whoo!

27:31.458 --> 27:32.916
You know he's out here looking rough.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.666
If your mother could see you now,
she'd have a stroke.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.833
- Got a camera on you?

27:39.916 --> 27:42.625
Oh, my God, it's Lily Law.
Everybody, three feet apart.

27:42.708 --> 27:44.333
It's probably Harold now.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.583
No, it's the delivery boy from the bakery.

27:49.666 --> 27:52.291
-Oh, thank God.
-Ask him if he's got any hot cross buns!

27:56.375 --> 27:57.958
Come on, Emory. Knock it off.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.750
You can take her anywhere but out.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.583
You remind me
of an old maid school teacher.

28:03.666 --> 28:05.291
You remind me of a chicken wing.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.041
-I'm sure you meant that as a compliment.
-Good evening.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.333
Hey, Bernard, remember that thing
we used to do on Fire Island?

28:18.416 --> 28:21.708
Whoo! That was in so far back,
I think I've forgotten.

28:21.791 --> 28:23.583
I remember.

28:23.666 --> 28:25.416
-Baby, come on, follow.
-What is it?

28:25.500 --> 28:28.166
-It goes swing, swing. Hook, hook.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

28:28.250 --> 28:31.083
Milk the cow,
milk the cow, milk the cow…

28:31.166 --> 28:33.208
You gotta swing it. You gotta hit it.

28:35.791 --> 28:38.916

-Why would you--

30:03.500 --> 30:06.583
I thought… I'm…
You said that you weren't coming.

30:06.666 --> 30:08.291
Well, I'm sorry.

30:10.083 --> 30:12.458
Well, we were just acting silly.

30:13.958 --> 30:16.458
When I called,
I was at a phone booth around the corner.

30:16.541 --> 30:18.083
My dinner party isn't far from here.

30:18.166 --> 30:21.041
Emory was showing us this silly dance.

30:21.125 --> 30:23.250
I walked past,
and your downstairs door was open.

30:23.333 --> 30:24.375
This is Emory.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.125
Everybody, this is Alan McCarthy.

30:29.208 --> 30:34.166
Alan, counterclockwise, we have
Larry, Bernard, Donald, Emory and Hank.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.500
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.583
-Would you like a drink?
-Thanks, no. I-I can't stay long.

30:38.666 --> 30:41.250
You're here now, so stay.
What would you like?

30:41.333 --> 30:42.666
-Scotch, please.
-Scotch.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.583
-I'll get it.
- Thank you.

30:49.875 --> 30:52.375
-Guess I'm the only beer drinker.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.875
Whose, uh, birthday is it?

30:54.958 --> 30:56.750
-Harold's.
- Harold?

30:56.833 --> 30:59.583
- He's not here yet.
-She's never been on time in her li--

31:01.916 --> 31:05.041
He's… never been on time in his life.

31:05.125 --> 31:09.875
Hank, Alan is from Washington.
We went to college together, Georgetown.

31:09.958 --> 31:10.958
-Ah.
-Yeah.

31:13.125 --> 31:14.750
Well, isn't that fascinating?

31:14.833 --> 31:17.416
If that's too strong,
I'll put some water in it for you.

31:18.958 --> 31:20.750
It's fine, thanks. Fine.

31:22.875 --> 31:25.666
-You in the government, Alan?
-No, I'm a lawyer.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.500
-What do you do?
-I teach school.

31:27.583 --> 31:30.416
Oh. Would have taken you
for an athlete of some sort.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.250
You look like you might play sports.

31:35.333 --> 31:39.000
Well, I'm no professional, but I was
on the basketball team in college.

31:39.083 --> 31:41.166
-Played quite a bit of tennis.
-I play tennis, too.

31:41.250 --> 31:43.291
-Great game. It is, yeah.
- Yeah, great.

31:45.166 --> 31:46.625
-What do you teach?
-Math.

31:46.708 --> 31:47.958
-Math?
-Yeah.

31:48.541 --> 31:49.375
Math.

31:51.291 --> 31:55.041
Kind of makes you want to rush out
and buy a slide rule, doesn't it?

31:56.041 --> 31:57.791
Emory, I need help in the kitchen.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.041
-You're elected. Come on.
-I'm always elected.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.958
-You're a natural-born domestic.
-Said the African queen!

32:03.041 --> 32:05.291
You come, too. Fan me
while I make the salad dressing.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.125
- This way, Emory.

32:11.750 --> 32:12.750
Why don't we all sit down?

32:12.833 --> 32:13.916
-Sure.
-Yeah.

32:24.166 --> 32:26.583
I feel terrible
barging in on you fellas this way.

32:26.666 --> 32:27.541
Ah, that's okay.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.791
- How've you been?
-Fine, thanks. And you?

32:33.375 --> 32:34.416
You married?

32:35.750 --> 32:37.500
-What?
-I see you're married.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.750
Oh.

32:38.833 --> 32:42.333
Yes, Hank is married.
Donald, cope with some ice.

32:44.541 --> 32:46.458
-Do you have any kids?
-Yes, two.

32:46.541 --> 32:47.916
A boy, nine. A girl, seven.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.708
You should see my boy play tennis.
Really puts his dad to shame.

32:51.791 --> 32:53.958
-I have two kids, too. Both girls.
- Great.

32:54.708 --> 32:57.458
-How are the girls, Alan?
-Oh, just sensational.

32:57.541 --> 32:59.708
-Yeah?
-They're something, those kids.

32:59.791 --> 33:01.750
God, I'm-I'm nuts about them.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.916
-How long you been married?
- Nine years.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.375
Ah!

33:06.458 --> 33:08.625
-Can you believe it, Mickey?
-No.

33:09.208 --> 33:11.708
Mickey used to go with my wife
when we were all in school.

33:11.791 --> 33:13.416
-Can you believe that?

33:13.500 --> 33:16.125
Oh, Lord. Sorry.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.500
You live in the city?

33:23.250 --> 33:26.000
Yes, we do.

33:30.958 --> 33:31.958
Oh!

33:32.458 --> 33:34.625
I'm in
the process of getting a divorce.

33:35.125 --> 33:38.666
-Larry and I are roommates at the moment.
-Yes, they're roommates.

33:39.958 --> 33:42.208
Oh, I'm very sorry. I mean--

33:42.291 --> 33:43.916
-No, I understand.
- Mmm.

33:48.041 --> 33:50.791
-I think I'd like another.
-Of course. I'm so sorry.

33:55.125 --> 33:56.291
Can I help you, Alan?

33:56.958 --> 33:58.041
Uh…

33:59.583 --> 34:01.166
Can't seem to find the scotch.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.166
It's in your hand.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.875
-Oh.

34:04.958 --> 34:06.208
Of course. How stupid of me.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.791
-Why don't you let me do that for you?
-Thank you.

34:08.875 --> 34:12.833
-Where the hell could Harold be?
-Oh, he's always late.

34:12.916 --> 34:15.291
You know how neurotic
he can be about going out in public.

34:15.375 --> 34:16.791
Takes him hours to get ready.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.708
-Why is that?
-Why is what?

34:18.791 --> 34:21.958
Why does it take Harold hours
to get ready before he can go out?

34:22.750 --> 34:24.541
Because she's a sick lady. That's why.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.708
Alan, why don't we go upstairs and talk?

34:26.791 --> 34:28.583
I'm just gonna finish this and go.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.833
Come on. You can bring your drink.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.791
-I-I finished it.
- Here.

34:40.291 --> 34:43.583
-Excuse me. We'll be down in a minute.
-Oh, he'll still be here.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.625
-Come on. This way, Alan.
-Sure.

34:54.375 --> 34:55.583
What was that supposed to mean?

34:55.666 --> 34:57.791
-What was what supposed to mean?
-You know.

34:58.875 --> 35:00.375
-Do you want another beer?
-No.

35:02.208 --> 35:03.625
You're jealous, aren't you?

35:03.708 --> 35:05.833
-I'm Larry.

35:06.958 --> 35:08.166
You're jealous.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.500
So, Donald, where have you been
hanging out these days?

35:12.583 --> 35:14.333
I haven't seen you in a long time.

35:19.666 --> 35:21.125
- Alan…

35:23.291 --> 35:26.833
I want to try to explain
something about this evening.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.291
What's to explain? Sometimes you just…

35:29.375 --> 35:31.583
can't invite everybody
to every party, and…

35:32.166 --> 35:34.458
Some people take it personally,
but not me.

35:34.541 --> 35:36.791
I should apologize for inviting myself.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.958
That is not exactly what I meant.

35:39.666 --> 35:42.250
Your friends seem like awfully nice guys.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.958
That Hank is a very attractive fellow.

35:45.541 --> 35:46.666
Yes, he is.

35:47.500 --> 35:50.083
-What's his roommate's name?
-Uh, Larry.

35:50.166 --> 35:51.000
What does he do?

35:52.166 --> 35:53.708
He's a commercial artist.

35:53.791 --> 35:56.291
I liked Donald, too.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.916
The only one
I didn't care for too much was…

36:02.625 --> 36:04.041
What's his name? Emory?

36:04.125 --> 36:05.916
Yes, Emory.

36:06.541 --> 36:09.125
Just can't stand that kind of talk.
It grates on me.

36:13.541 --> 36:15.333
What kind of talk, Alan?

36:15.416 --> 36:19.458
Oh, you know, his…
brand of humor, I guess.

36:19.541 --> 36:22.250
He can be really quite funny sometimes.

36:22.333 --> 36:25.291
I suppose, if you find
that sort of thing amusing. He just…

36:26.083 --> 36:28.458
seems like such a goddamn little pansy.

36:31.583 --> 36:34.333
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean to say that. That's…

36:35.541 --> 36:38.083
such an awful thing
to say about anyone.

36:38.958 --> 36:40.750
But you know what I mean, Michael.

36:41.458 --> 36:43.375
You have to admit he is effeminate.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
-He is a bit.
-A bit?

36:48.125 --> 36:50.083
He's like a butterfly in heat.

36:51.416 --> 36:54.083
There's no wonder
he was teaching you all to dance.

36:54.875 --> 36:57.166
He probably wanted to dance with you.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.416
Oh, come on, man. You know me.

37:04.625 --> 37:08.458
You know how I feel.
Your private life is your own affair.

37:09.291 --> 37:11.416
No, I don't know that about you, Alan.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.416
I-I…

37:13.291 --> 37:15.708
don't care what people do
as long as they don't do it in public

37:15.791 --> 37:18.083
or try to force their ways
on the whole world.

37:18.166 --> 37:20.208
What were you crying about
on the telephone?

37:20.291 --> 37:24.333
All I-- All I can say is
please forgive me for making…

37:25.166 --> 37:26.750
such an ass of myself.

37:26.833 --> 37:29.083
You must have been upset
or you wouldn't have said you were

37:29.166 --> 37:31.125
and that you wanted to see me,
you had to see me.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.583
-Michael, please.
-Is something wrong between you and Fran?

37:33.666 --> 37:35.166
Listen, I've really gotta go.

37:35.250 --> 37:36.333
Why are you in New York?

37:36.416 --> 37:38.916
-Late for this dinner.
-Whose dinner? Where are you going?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.250
-Is that the loo?
-Yes.

37:40.791 --> 37:41.958
Excuse me.

37:50.791 --> 37:53.333
What's going on in here?
Oh, Mary, don't ask.

37:53.916 --> 37:55.875
Hank, why don't you come and join us?

37:56.916 --> 37:59.958
That's an interesting suggestion.
Whose idea is that?

38:00.583 --> 38:02.583
-Mine.

38:02.666 --> 38:04.458
He means in conversation.

38:04.541 --> 38:08.291
-Where are the rest of the wine glasses?
-I's working as fast as I can.

38:09.916 --> 38:11.666
- To your health.
- Up yours.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.583
Up my health?

38:14.166 --> 38:16.625
-Where's the gent?
-He's in the gent's room.

38:16.708 --> 38:18.875
If you can all hang on
for five more minutes,

38:18.958 --> 38:20.208
he's about to leave.

38:20.291 --> 38:22.083
-Well, at last.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.083
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

38:29.166 --> 38:30.958
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

38:31.041 --> 38:34.958
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Harold</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

38:35.916 --> 38:37.000
Oh!

38:40.625 --> 38:42.083
Who the hell are you?

38:42.166 --> 38:44.833
She's Harold's present from me
and she's early,

38:44.916 --> 38:47.458
and that's not even Harold, you idiot!

38:47.541 --> 38:49.208
You said whoever answered the door.

38:49.875 --> 38:53.666
But not until midnight.
He's supposed to be a midnight cowboy.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.666
He looks right out of the chorus
of a bus-and-truck <i>Oklahoma!</i>

38:57.750 --> 39:01.041
Not until midnight, and you're supposed
to sing to the right person.

39:01.125 --> 39:05.083
I told you Harold
has very tight, tight, black curly hair.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.041
This number's practically bald.

39:07.125 --> 39:09.291
Thank you, and fuck you!

39:09.375 --> 39:10.875
Good thing I didn't open the door.

39:10.958 --> 39:13.958
-Not that tight and not that black.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.083
I-I forgot.

39:15.583 --> 39:17.666
Besides, I wanted to get
to the bars by midnight.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.000
Oh, he's a class act all the way around.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.708
What do you mean, "get to the bars"?

39:21.791 --> 39:24.041
Sweetie, I paid you
for the whole night, remember?

39:24.125 --> 39:27.291
I hurt my back doing my exercises,
and I wanted to get to bed early.

39:27.375 --> 39:29.875
Well, that's too bad. What happened?

39:29.958 --> 39:32.291
-I lost my grip doing my chin-ups,

39:32.375 --> 39:34.333
and I fell on my heels
and twisted my back.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.458
You shouldn't wear heels
when you do chin-ups!

39:38.833 --> 39:41.833
I shouldn't do chin-ups.
I got a weak grip.

39:41.916 --> 39:44.833
Aw, weak grip. In my day,
it used to be called a limp wrist.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.625
Who can remember that far back?

39:46.708 --> 39:49.666
-What's your card say?
-Here. Read it.

39:52.708 --> 39:56.000
"Dear Harold, bang-bang. You're alive."

39:56.083 --> 39:58.583
"Now roll over and play dead."

39:58.666 --> 40:01.125
-"Happy Birthday, Emory."

40:01.208 --> 40:02.958
Sheer poetry, Emmy.

40:03.041 --> 40:05.083
And in your usual good taste.

40:05.166 --> 40:08.333
So conservative of you
to resist a sign in Times Square.

40:10.541 --> 40:14.291
-Cheese it, here comes the socialite nun.
-Shit. God damn it, Emory.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.458
Well, I'm off.
Thanks, Michael, for the drink.

40:20.541 --> 40:23.041
Oh, you're entirely welcome.
So I'll see you tomorrow?

40:23.125 --> 40:27.208
No. No, I think I'm gonna be awfully busy.
Might even go back to Washington.

40:27.291 --> 40:30.125
-Got a heavy date in Lafayette Square?

40:30.208 --> 40:31.625
-What?
- Emory.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.041
Forget it.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.208
Are you Harold?

40:38.291 --> 40:41.083
No, he's not Harold. He's for Harold.

40:44.750 --> 40:48.000
-Goodbye, Hank. It was nice to meet you.
-Same here, Alan.

40:48.083 --> 40:50.125
If you're in Washington,
I'd like you to meet my wife.

40:50.208 --> 40:52.250
That'd be fun. Wouldn't it, Hank?

40:52.333 --> 40:54.833
Yeah, I'm sure they'd love to meet him…

40:54.916 --> 40:56.083
Her.

40:57.333 --> 41:00.791
I have such a problem with pronouns.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.833
How many S's are in the word pronoun?

41:04.625 --> 41:07.791
How'd you like to kiss my ass?
That's got two more S's in it.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.750
-How'd you like to blow me?
-Mmm.

41:11.583 --> 41:13.750
What's wrong with your wife?
She got lockjaw?

41:13.833 --> 41:15.750
Faggot! Fairy!

41:18.500 --> 41:20.791
-Emory!
- You goddamn freak.

41:28.041 --> 41:31.125
Motherfucker!
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

41:38.250 --> 41:40.416
Fucking faggot! Faggot!

41:41.166 --> 41:42.416
-Get some ice!
- Freak!

41:42.500 --> 41:44.208
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

41:45.583 --> 41:46.625
Just relax.

41:46.708 --> 41:48.833
He just
busted your lip, love. Larry?

41:48.916 --> 41:50.291
-Here.

41:51.875 --> 41:53.583
- Jesus.
- Damn it.

42:00.166 --> 42:02.208
Do you mind waiting
over there with the gifts?

42:08.208 --> 42:11.375
Well, Harold! Happy birthday.

42:11.916 --> 42:13.625
You're just in time for the floor show,

42:14.208 --> 42:17.000
which you can see is on the floor.

42:17.083 --> 42:19.333
Hey, you, this is Harold.

42:20.250 --> 42:21.958
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

42:22.041 --> 42:25.583
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday, dear Harold ♪</i>

42:25.666 --> 42:27.541
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

43:06.500 --> 43:08.250
What's so fucking funny?

43:13.166 --> 43:14.125
Life.

43:15.750 --> 43:19.375
Life is a goddamned laugh riot.
You remember life?

43:19.458 --> 43:21.666
-You're stoned.
-Happy birthday, Harold.

43:21.750 --> 43:23.750
You're stoned, and you're late.

43:23.833 --> 43:25.500
You were supposed
to arrive at this location

43:25.583 --> 43:28.291
at approximately 8:30 dash 9:00.

43:29.750 --> 43:31.166
What I am, Michael,

43:32.416 --> 43:37.416
is a 32-year-old,
ugly, pock-marked, Jew fairy,

43:38.125 --> 43:41.583
and if it takes me a while
to pull myself together,

43:42.166 --> 43:45.583
and if I smoke a little grass
before I can get up the nerve

43:45.666 --> 43:47.416
to show this face to the world,

43:48.541 --> 43:52.750
then it's nobody's
goddamn business but my own.

43:54.791 --> 43:56.625
And how are you this evening?

43:57.208 --> 43:58.958
Happy birthday, Hallie.

44:00.083 --> 44:02.166
- What happened to you?
-Don't ask.

44:02.250 --> 44:03.458
Your lips are turning blue.

44:03.541 --> 44:05.458
You look like
you've been rimming a snowman.

44:05.541 --> 44:07.458
That piss-elegant kooze hit me.

44:07.541 --> 44:10.666
Careful, Emory. That kind of talk
just makes him so nervous.

44:10.750 --> 44:11.875
Who is she?

44:12.458 --> 44:13.666
Who was she?

44:14.333 --> 44:16.375
Who does she hope to be?

44:16.458 --> 44:18.208
Who knows? Who cares?

44:18.291 --> 44:20.166
His name is Alan McCarthy.

44:21.416 --> 44:25.666
Not the famous college chum?
Is this my surprise from you, Michael?

44:25.750 --> 44:27.791
I think Alan is the one
who got the surprise.

44:27.875 --> 44:31.625
- You'll notice he's speechless.
-I hope she's in shock! She's a beast!

44:32.458 --> 44:33.875
Is it his birthday, too?

44:33.958 --> 44:36.916
- That's your surprise.
-Speaking of beasts.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
From me to you, darling.
How do you like it?

44:39.083 --> 44:42.625
Well, I suppose
he has an interesting face and body,

44:42.708 --> 44:46.583
but it turns me right off 'cause
he can't talk intelligently about art.

44:46.666 --> 44:48.500
Yeah, ain't it a shame?

44:48.583 --> 44:51.416
-I could never love anyone like that.
-Never. Who could?

44:51.500 --> 44:54.416
I could and you could, that's who could.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.291
Mary, she's gorgeous.

44:56.875 --> 44:59.250
She may be dumb, but she's all yours.

44:59.333 --> 45:03.125
I think my present is a super surprise.
I'm so thrilled to get it.

45:03.208 --> 45:06.583
I would kiss you,
but I don't want to get blood all over me.

45:06.666 --> 45:08.500
Look at my top!

45:09.250 --> 45:11.250
Wait till you see your face.

45:11.333 --> 45:14.625
Come on, Emory. Let's clean you up, hmm?
Happy birthday, Harold.

45:15.250 --> 45:17.541
-Thanks, love.
- Top is ruined.

45:17.625 --> 45:19.291
Take one of mine
from the bedroom.

45:19.375 --> 45:21.166
The one on the floor is vicuña.

45:22.250 --> 45:25.250
Just another birthday party
with the folks.

45:26.416 --> 45:30.541
Here's a cold bottle of Pouilly-Fuissé
I bought especially for you, kiddo.

45:30.625 --> 45:34.208
Pussycat, all is forgiven. You can stay.

45:34.791 --> 45:39.208
No. You can stay,
but not all is forgiven. Cheers.

45:44.958 --> 45:48.125
Who asked Mr. Right
to celebrate my birthday?

45:49.125 --> 45:50.916
There are no accidents.

45:51.666 --> 45:53.000
And who asked him?

45:54.541 --> 45:55.375
Guilty.

45:56.041 --> 45:58.375
Always got to have
your crutch, haven't you?

45:58.458 --> 45:59.708
I'm not leaving.

45:59.791 --> 46:02.541
I feel sick. I think I'm gonna throw up.

46:02.625 --> 46:05.875
Say that again, and I won't
have to take my appetite suppressants.

46:05.958 --> 46:09.250
-Easy does it. One step at a time.

46:20.125 --> 46:23.125
I am not ready
for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.

46:25.583 --> 46:27.750
Nor will I be for the next two weeks.

46:27.833 --> 46:30.958
Oh, my God! He's after me again!

46:31.041 --> 46:33.458
-He's sick.
-Yeah, sick in the head.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.125
Mary, take me home.
These queens are crazy.

46:40.666 --> 46:41.833
Turning on.

46:45.791 --> 46:48.958
-Anybody care to join me?
-Many thanks. No.

46:49.875 --> 46:51.250
No, thank you.

46:51.875 --> 46:54.041
How about you, Tex?

46:54.666 --> 46:55.625
Yeah.

46:57.125 --> 47:01.583
Michael, I left the casserole
in the oven. Take it out anytime.

47:01.666 --> 47:02.750
You're not going.

47:02.833 --> 47:05.750
- I couldn't eat now anyway.
-Well, I'm absolutely starving.

47:05.833 --> 47:07.416
I'll eat until I have a fat attack.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.541
I said you're not going.

47:09.625 --> 47:11.250
Beware the hostile fag.

47:11.333 --> 47:14.583
When he's sober, he's dangerous.
When he drinks, he's lethal.

47:14.666 --> 47:17.625
-Attention must not be paid.
- Well, I'm starved, Em.

47:17.708 --> 47:21.666
I'm ready for some of your
Alice B. Toklas' opium-baked lasagna.

47:21.750 --> 47:24.375
Are you really? Aw.

47:24.458 --> 47:27.458
That makes me so pleased.
Maybe I'll serve it before I leave.

47:27.541 --> 47:30.291
Nobody is going anywhere.

47:31.458 --> 47:34.041
You're gonna have schmertz tomorrow
you wouldn't believe.

47:34.125 --> 47:36.500
-Hey, do a figure-eight on that.

47:37.416 --> 47:41.291
I'm turning on. You're just turning.

47:41.375 --> 47:44.541
-Michael? Is there any air spray?
- Hairspray?

47:45.166 --> 47:48.666
You're supposed to be holding his head,
not doing his hair.

47:48.750 --> 47:50.083
Air spray, not hairspray.

47:50.166 --> 47:52.416
There's a can of floral spray
on top of the john.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.666
Thanks.

47:53.750 --> 47:57.000
I keep my grass
in the medicine cabinet in a Band-Aid box.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.833
Somebody told me it's the safest place.

47:58.916 --> 48:01.250
If the cops arrive,
you can lock yourself in the bathroom

48:01.333 --> 48:02.625
and flush it down the john.

48:02.708 --> 48:03.916
That's very cagey.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.833
Makes more sense
than where I was keeping it.

48:05.916 --> 48:08.208
In an oregano jar in the spice rack.

48:08.875 --> 48:13.000
I kept forgetting, and accidentally
turning my hateful mother on with a salad,

48:13.916 --> 48:15.083
but I think she likes it.

48:15.166 --> 48:18.625
No matter what meal she comes over for,
even if it's breakfast, she says,

48:18.708 --> 48:19.791
"Let's have a salad!"

48:25.250 --> 48:28.958
You are definitely the type
that still moves his lips when he reads,

48:29.625 --> 48:31.083
and who sits in a steam room

48:31.166 --> 48:33.583
and says things like,
"Hot enough for you?"

48:33.666 --> 48:36.250
I never use the steam room
when I go to the gym.

48:36.875 --> 48:39.208
It's bad after a workout.
It flattens you down.

48:40.541 --> 48:44.833
Just after you've broken your back
to blow yourself up like a poisoned dog?

48:46.416 --> 48:48.791
-Yeah.
- You're right, Harold.

48:49.833 --> 48:52.708
Not only can he not
talk intelligently about art,

48:52.791 --> 48:55.750
he can't even follow
from one sentence to the next.

48:56.625 --> 48:58.041
But he's beautiful.

48:58.916 --> 49:01.541
He has unnatural natural beauty.

49:02.208 --> 49:05.125
-Not that that means anything.
-It doesn't mean everything.

49:05.208 --> 49:08.708
Keep telling yourself that
as your hair drops out in handfuls.

49:09.541 --> 49:14.708
Not that it's not natural for one's hair
to recede as one reaches seniority.

49:15.750 --> 49:19.208
You know, faggots are worse
than women about their age.

49:19.291 --> 49:21.500
They think their lives are over at 30.

49:21.583 --> 49:24.708
Physical beauty
is not that goddamned important.

49:24.791 --> 49:27.041
Well, of course it's not. How could it be?

49:27.125 --> 49:29.041
It's only in the eye of the beholder.

49:29.125 --> 49:33.375
And it's only skin-deep.
Don't forget about that one.

49:34.833 --> 49:37.791
Oh, no,
I haven't forgotten that one at all.

49:38.291 --> 49:42.375
It's only skin-deep,
and it's transitory, too.

49:42.458 --> 49:44.708
It's terribly transitory.

49:44.791 --> 49:50.416
I mean, how long does it last?
30 or 40 or 50 years at the most?

49:50.500 --> 49:54.833
Yes, it's too bad
about this poor boy's face.

49:55.833 --> 49:57.000
It's tragic.

49:57.625 --> 49:59.875
He's absolutely cursed.

50:01.041 --> 50:04.916
And how could his beauty
ever compare with my soul?

50:05.666 --> 50:07.625
And although I have never seen my soul,

50:07.708 --> 50:10.875
I understand from my mother's rabbi
that it's a knockout.

50:11.791 --> 50:14.791
I, however, cannot seem
to locate it for a gander,

50:14.875 --> 50:17.833
and if I could,
I would sell it in a flash

50:17.916 --> 50:21.750
for some skin-deep,
transitory, meaningless beauty.

50:21.833 --> 50:24.541
Forgive him, Father,
for he know not what he do.

50:24.625 --> 50:27.125
Oh, Michael, you kill me.

50:27.208 --> 50:29.083
You don't know
which side of the fence you're on.

50:29.166 --> 50:31.708
If somebody says something pro-religion,
you're against them.

50:31.791 --> 50:34.166
If somebody denies God,
you're against them.

50:34.833 --> 50:37.333
One might say
you have a problem in this area.

50:37.416 --> 50:39.791
You can't live with it,
you can't live without it.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.458
-Hot stuff coming through!
-Hey!

50:41.541 --> 50:44.625
You know what? One could murder you
with very little effort.

50:44.708 --> 50:48.708
You hang on to that great
insurance policy called the church.

50:48.791 --> 50:50.541
That's right, I believe in God.

50:50.625 --> 50:54.416
And if it turns out that there
really isn't one? Okay, nothing lost.

50:54.500 --> 50:57.208
But if it turns out that there is,
I'm covered.

50:57.291 --> 50:59.958
Harriet Hypocrite, that's who you are.

51:00.041 --> 51:03.000
Right. I am one
of those truly rotten Catholics

51:03.083 --> 51:06.791
who gets drunk, sins all night,
and goes to Mass the next morning.

51:06.875 --> 51:09.541
It depends on what you think sin is.

51:09.625 --> 51:13.458
Would you shut your minty mouth
and get back to the goddamn kitchen?

51:14.875 --> 51:17.333
Say whatever you want. Just don't hit me.

51:18.708 --> 51:21.333
Well, is it bigger than a breadstick?

51:21.416 --> 51:23.250
He's laying down for a little bit.

51:23.333 --> 51:25.625
-How does the bathroom smell?
-Better.

51:25.708 --> 51:28.000
-Before it smelled like somebody puked.

51:28.083 --> 51:30.583
Now it smells like somebody
puked in a gardenia patch.

51:30.666 --> 51:32.666
Dinner is served!

51:35.083 --> 51:36.666
What would you like, big boy?

51:36.750 --> 51:39.291
Alan McCarthy, and don't hold the mayo.

51:39.375 --> 51:42.833
Oh, Em, it looks absolutely fabulous.

51:42.916 --> 51:44.583
I'd make somebody a good wife.

51:44.666 --> 51:46.583
-What is it?
-Lasagna.

51:46.666 --> 51:49.833
Looks like spaghetti and meatballs
sort of flattened out.

51:51.166 --> 51:54.041
-Well, it's been in the steam room.

51:54.125 --> 51:55.833
-It has?
-Oh, my God.

51:56.500 --> 52:00.458
"It looks like spaghetti and meatballs
sort of flattened out."

52:00.541 --> 52:02.916
Oh, yes, Harold, truly enviable.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.833
As opposed to you,
who knows so much about haute cuisine.

52:06.916 --> 52:10.458
Raconteur, gourmet, troll.

52:11.083 --> 52:12.875
-It's good.
-You like it? Eat it.

52:12.958 --> 52:14.875
Stuff your mouth
so you can't say anything.

52:14.958 --> 52:15.791
Turning.

52:15.875 --> 52:17.416
- Wine?
- No, thank you.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.833
Oh, go on, kiddo. Force yourself.

52:19.916 --> 52:23.541
Have a little <i>vin ordinaire</i>
to wash down all that depressed pasta.

52:23.625 --> 52:27.333
Sommelier, connoisseur, pig.

52:28.250 --> 52:29.708
Aren't you gonna have any?

52:29.791 --> 52:33.750
No, my lip hurts too much to eat.
Anybody gonna bring a plate up to Alan?

52:33.833 --> 52:37.833
Oh. The punching bag
is now dissolved into Flo Nightingale.

52:37.916 --> 52:39.375
Do you like it, Hallie?

52:39.458 --> 52:42.750
Mmm. I'm having seconds and thirds
and maybe even fifths.

52:42.833 --> 52:45.250
I'm absolutely desperate
to keep the weight up.

52:46.708 --> 52:50.083
You're absolutely paranoid
about absolutely everything.

52:50.166 --> 52:54.125
Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you
not tell me about it?

52:54.916 --> 52:57.125
You starve yourself all day

52:57.208 --> 52:59.625
so that you can
gorge yourself at one meal,

52:59.708 --> 53:04.500
and then you moan and groan about
how fat you are and how ugly you are,

53:04.583 --> 53:08.000
when the truth is you're no fatter
or thinner than you ever were.

53:08.083 --> 53:10.333
-Polly Paranoia.
-This is great, Emory.

53:10.416 --> 53:13.666
Connie Casserole. No trouble at all.
Oh, Mary, don't ask.

53:13.750 --> 53:18.250
Oh! Oh! And this pathological lateness,
that's downright crazy.

53:18.333 --> 53:19.333
Turning!

53:19.416 --> 53:22.291
Standing before a bathroom mirror
for hours and hours

53:22.375 --> 53:24.791
before you can walk out on the street,

53:24.875 --> 53:29.041
and looking no different
after Christ knows how many applications

53:29.125 --> 53:33.916
of Christ knows how many
ointments and salves and creams and masks.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.208
I've got bad skin. What can I tell you?

53:37.291 --> 53:40.041
Who wouldn't after they deliberately
take a pair of tweezers

53:40.125 --> 53:42.791
and deliberately mutilate their pores?

53:42.875 --> 53:44.666
There's no wonder
you got holes in your face

53:44.750 --> 53:48.583
after the hack job you have done
on yourself year in and year out.

53:48.666 --> 53:50.916
King of the pig people.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.041
Yes, you've got scars on your face,
but they're not that bad.

53:54.125 --> 53:56.041
And if you'd leave yourself alone,

53:56.125 --> 53:59.125
you wouldn't have any more
than you've already awarded yourself.

54:00.541 --> 54:03.916
You'd really like me
to compliment you now, wouldn't you,

54:04.000 --> 54:05.333
for how honest you're being?

54:06.458 --> 54:08.250
For being my best friend who will tell me

54:08.333 --> 54:12.458
what even my best friends won't tell me,
you hateful sow.

54:12.541 --> 54:14.625
And the pills!

54:14.708 --> 54:16.958
Harold has been gathering, saving,

54:17.041 --> 54:19.708
and storing up barbiturates
for the past year

54:19.791 --> 54:21.375
like a goddamn squirrel.

54:21.458 --> 54:24.375
Hundreds of Nembutals,
hundreds of Seconals.

54:24.458 --> 54:26.250
All in preparation for,

54:26.333 --> 54:30.291
and anticipation of,
the long winter of his death.

54:30.375 --> 54:31.958
I'll tell you right now, Hallie,

54:32.041 --> 54:35.416
when the time comes,
you'll never have the guts.

54:36.041 --> 54:38.333
It's not always like it happens in plays.

54:38.416 --> 54:42.000
Not all faggots bump themselves off
at the end of the story.

54:46.625 --> 54:49.208
-What you say may be true.

54:50.208 --> 54:52.416
Time will undoubtedly tell.

54:53.333 --> 54:56.333
But in the meantime,
you've left out one detail.

54:58.375 --> 55:01.666
The cosmetics
and astringents are paid for,

55:02.625 --> 55:05.208
the bathroom is paid for,

55:05.916 --> 55:07.666
the tweezers are paid for,

55:07.750 --> 55:12.625
and the pills… are paid for.

55:19.125 --> 55:22.166
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

55:22.250 --> 55:26.625

55:34.750 --> 55:36.041
You're so sweet.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.541
Blow out the candles, Mary,
and make a wish!

55:39.625 --> 55:41.083
Blow out your candles, Laura.

55:49.583 --> 55:53.125
- She's 32 years young!
- Oh, my God.

55:53.208 --> 55:56.041
-Now you have to open your gifts.
-Start with this one.

55:56.125 --> 55:59.041
Presents! Where's the card?

55:59.125 --> 56:01.083
-Uh…
- Here.

56:01.875 --> 56:04.291
-Oh, from Larry.
- Larry.

56:04.375 --> 56:06.083
Why would you put it on the back?

56:09.375 --> 56:14.208
Oh, it's heaven.
Oh, I just love it, Larry.

56:14.291 --> 56:16.875
-What is it?
-The deed to Boardwalk.

56:16.958 --> 56:19.375
- Aw. Gay pop art.

56:20.083 --> 56:22.666
Oh, Larry, it's super.
It goes up the minute I get home.

56:22.750 --> 56:24.166
-Oh, good.
- I don't get it.

56:24.250 --> 56:25.958
You cruise Atlantic City or something?

56:26.875 --> 56:28.583
How much did you pay for him?

56:29.250 --> 56:33.375
-He was a steal.
-I'm not a steal. I cost $20.

56:35.583 --> 56:38.291
And what do you do for $20?

56:38.875 --> 56:39.958
I do my best.

56:40.041 --> 56:43.416
Oh, what a nifty sweater.

56:44.416 --> 56:45.625
Thank you, Hank.

56:45.708 --> 56:47.750
You can take it back,
exchange it for something else.

56:47.833 --> 56:52.833
-No, I think this one is just… nifty.

56:54.166 --> 56:55.791
-Who wants cake?
- Everybody?

56:55.875 --> 56:56.791
None for me.

56:56.875 --> 56:58.291
-There you go.
-Thanks.

56:58.875 --> 57:02.208
Oh, Bernard! How divine!

57:02.291 --> 57:05.083
Look, everybody, bejeweled knee pads.

57:07.666 --> 57:08.958
Monogrammed.

57:09.541 --> 57:11.166
Bernard, you're a camp!

57:23.125 --> 57:24.333
Thank you, Michael.

57:25.083 --> 57:26.000
What?

57:27.458 --> 57:28.458
Oh.

57:30.750 --> 57:33.333
-You're welcome.
- What is it, Harold?

57:34.083 --> 57:36.375
It's a photograph of him
in a silver frame,

57:36.458 --> 57:39.166
and there's an inscription engraved
and the date.

57:39.958 --> 57:41.000
What's it say?

57:46.750 --> 57:48.458
Just something personal.

57:51.041 --> 57:54.875
Hey, Bernard, what do you say we have
a little music to liven things up?

57:54.958 --> 57:58.333
-Okay.
-Yeah, I feel like dancing.

58:00.583 --> 58:01.625
Come on, Michael.

58:02.458 --> 58:04.375
Oh, no, thanks. I can only lead.

58:05.166 --> 58:08.958
- I can follow.
-Oh, I think I'll sip this one out.

58:09.041 --> 58:09.875

-Michael!
- Everybody, help clean up.

1:00:26.916 --> 1:00:28.791
Go, go, go! Come on!

1:00:33.583 --> 1:00:36.250
-Come here, kid.

1:00:39.833 --> 1:00:42.625
- Everybody, hurry up!
- Close the door!

1:00:44.375 --> 1:00:46.208
- Come on, guys.
- Come on.

1:00:47.791 --> 1:00:49.166
Get the fuck inside.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.875
- Oh God.

1:00:51.958 --> 1:00:53.208
I'm dripping all over.

1:00:55.083 --> 1:00:57.208
Take a towel.
Don't get the goddamn furniture wet.

1:00:57.291 --> 1:01:00.458
-Here. Towel. Dry off.
-Jesus, Michael.

1:01:00.541 --> 1:01:02.125
-Thanks. Thanks, Michael.

1:01:05.208 --> 1:01:06.208
Wanna dance?

1:01:06.291 --> 1:01:08.833
Uh-oh, Yvonne the Terrible is back.

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.833
Oh, hello, Alan. You feel better?

1:01:13.458 --> 1:01:15.791
Oh, no. No, no, no. Alan, no.

1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:20.833
As they say in the Deep South,
don't rush off in this inclement weather.

1:01:20.916 --> 1:01:22.250
You'll never get a cab.

1:01:22.333 --> 1:01:24.416
Revolution complete.

1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:27.916
You missed the cake
and you missed the opening of the gifts,

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.500
but you're still in luck.

1:01:29.583 --> 1:01:32.208
You're just in time for a party game.

1:01:32.291 --> 1:01:34.125
Hey, everybody, game time.

1:01:34.208 --> 1:01:36.291
Michael, why don't you just let him go?

1:01:36.916 --> 1:01:38.333
He can go if he wants to,

1:01:39.083 --> 1:01:41.375
but not before we play a little game.

1:01:41.458 --> 1:01:43.708
What's it gonna be, movie-star gin?

1:01:43.791 --> 1:01:48.625
No. No, that's too faggy for Alan to play.
He wouldn't be any good at it.

1:01:48.708 --> 1:01:50.958
What would you like to play, Michael?
The Truth Game?

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:52.458
Cute, Hallie.

1:01:52.541 --> 1:01:54.583
Or would you like to play Murder?

1:01:54.666 --> 1:01:57.750
-You all remember that one, don't you?
- Very, very cute.

1:01:57.833 --> 1:01:59.625
As I recall, they're quite similar.

1:01:59.708 --> 1:02:02.416
The rules are the same in both:
you kill somebody.

1:02:03.291 --> 1:02:05.250
-Mickey, I'm leaving.
-Stay where you are.

1:02:05.333 --> 1:02:08.958
-Michael, let him go.
- He really doesn't want to.

1:02:09.041 --> 1:02:11.750
If he did, he'd have left a long time ago,

1:02:11.833 --> 1:02:13.750
or he wouldn't have come
in the first place.

1:02:13.833 --> 1:02:16.291
-Mickey. I don't feel--
-My name is Michael.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:17.958
I'm called Michael.

1:02:18.625 --> 1:02:21.500
You must never call
anyone called Michael "Mickey."

1:02:22.625 --> 1:02:26.000
Those of us who are named Michael
get very nervous about it.

1:02:27.541 --> 1:02:29.166
If you don't believe it, try it.

1:02:30.875 --> 1:02:32.208
I'm sorry. I…

1:02:33.875 --> 1:02:35.333
I can't think.

1:02:35.416 --> 1:02:36.958
You can think.

1:02:37.916 --> 1:02:39.500
What you can't do is leave.

1:02:39.583 --> 1:02:41.750
It's like watching
an accident on a highway.

1:02:41.833 --> 1:02:44.333
You can't look at it,
and you can't look away.

1:03:07.791 --> 1:03:10.041
Who's going to play
with Alan and me? Everyone?

1:03:10.125 --> 1:03:13.875
-I have no intention of playing.
-Yeah, nor do I.

1:03:13.958 --> 1:03:16.125
Well, not everyone
is a participant in life.

1:03:16.208 --> 1:03:19.083
There are always those
who stand on the sidelines and watch.

1:03:19.166 --> 1:03:21.708
-What's the game?
- Simply this:

1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:25.250
We all have to call on the telephone

1:03:25.333 --> 1:03:29.916
the one person
we truly believe we have loved.

1:03:31.791 --> 1:03:34.625
-I'm not playing.
-Oh, yes, you are.

1:03:35.250 --> 1:03:37.916
-You'd like for me to play.
-I'd like to know who you'd call

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.375
after all the fancy speeches
I've heard lately.

1:03:40.458 --> 1:03:42.875
Who'd you call, Hank? Would you call me?

1:03:42.958 --> 1:03:46.291
Oh! Sounds like there's,
how you say, trouble in paradise.

1:03:46.375 --> 1:03:49.250
Well, if there isn't,
I'm sure you could stir up some.

1:03:49.333 --> 1:03:51.375
And who would you call? Hmm?

1:03:52.041 --> 1:03:54.458
Don't think I think for one minute
that it would be me.

1:03:55.166 --> 1:03:57.583
Or that one call would do it.
You'd have to make several.

1:03:57.666 --> 1:04:00.250
Three long-distance,
God only knows how many locals.

1:04:00.333 --> 1:04:02.833
-I'm glad I don't have to pay the bill.
-Quiet.

1:04:02.916 --> 1:04:05.833
Don't worry.
Michael won't pay it either.

1:04:06.375 --> 1:04:10.875
Now, here's how it works.
If you make the call, you get one point.

1:04:10.958 --> 1:04:13.958
If the person you are calling answers,
you get two more points.

1:04:14.041 --> 1:04:16.041
Somebody else answers, you only get one.

1:04:16.125 --> 1:04:18.375
And if there's no answer at all…

1:04:18.958 --> 1:04:19.958
you're screwed.

1:04:20.041 --> 1:04:21.833
You're screwed if you make the call.

1:04:21.916 --> 1:04:24.750
When you get the person
whom you are calling on the line,

1:04:24.833 --> 1:04:28.208
if you tell them who you are,
you get two points. And then…

1:04:29.625 --> 1:04:33.083
If you tell them that you love them,

1:04:33.166 --> 1:04:35.958
you get a bonus of five more points.

1:04:36.041 --> 1:04:37.625
-Hateful.

1:04:37.708 --> 1:04:41.416
Therefore, you can get
as many as ten points and as few as one.

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:44.083
You can get as few as none
if you know how to work it.

1:04:44.166 --> 1:04:45.541
Hank, leave with me?

1:04:45.625 --> 1:04:47.750
Oh, well, now, did you hear that?

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:53.708
You don't understand, Alan. I can't.

1:04:54.583 --> 1:04:57.166
You can, but I can't.

1:04:57.250 --> 1:04:59.666
If he doesn't understand,
explain it to him.

1:04:59.750 --> 1:05:01.833
-I'll explain it.
-I had a feeling you might.

1:05:01.916 --> 1:05:04.416
Alan, Hank and Larry are lovers.

1:05:05.083 --> 1:05:06.500
They're not roommates.

1:05:06.583 --> 1:05:08.583
-Bedmates, lovers.
-Michael.

1:05:08.666 --> 1:05:11.583
No man's still got a roommate
when he's over 40 years old.

1:05:11.666 --> 1:05:13.583
If they're not lovers, they're sisters.

1:05:13.666 --> 1:05:16.583
-Hank is the one who's over 40.
-Well, you're pushing it.

1:05:17.541 --> 1:05:18.708
Hank.

1:05:21.166 --> 1:05:24.625
Yes, Alan. Larry and I are lovers.

1:05:24.708 --> 1:05:25.541
But…

1:05:26.791 --> 1:05:27.875
But you're married.

1:05:31.875 --> 1:05:33.125
Jesus Christ.

1:05:34.916 --> 1:05:37.625
I think you said the wrong thing.

1:05:37.708 --> 1:05:40.000
Don't you love that quaint little idea?

1:05:40.083 --> 1:05:43.500
If a man's married,
he's automatically heterosexual.

1:05:43.583 --> 1:05:49.708
Alan, Hank swings both ways…
with a definite preference.

1:05:55.416 --> 1:05:58.791
Now… who makes the first call?

1:06:03.208 --> 1:06:05.291
-Emory?
-You go, Bernard.

1:06:05.375 --> 1:06:08.958
-Mm. I don't want to.
-Go on, call up Peter Dahlbeck.

1:06:09.041 --> 1:06:12.000
-That's who you'd like to call, isn't it?
- Who is Peter Dahlbeck?

1:06:12.083 --> 1:06:13.208
The boy in Detroit

1:06:13.291 --> 1:06:15.583
whose family Bernard's mother
has been a laundress for

1:06:15.666 --> 1:06:18.208
since he was a little black-eyed pea.

1:06:20.541 --> 1:06:21.958
I worked for them, too,

1:06:23.083 --> 1:06:24.958
after school and every summer.

1:06:28.666 --> 1:06:30.416
I think I've loved him all my life.

1:06:33.958 --> 1:06:36.083
<i>But he never knew I was alive.</i>

1:06:42.416 --> 1:06:43.958
Besides, he's straight.

1:06:44.041 --> 1:06:45.750
Nothing ever happened between you?

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:49.083
They finally made it
in the pool house one night

1:06:49.166 --> 1:06:51.083
after a drunken swimming party.

1:06:51.166 --> 1:06:55.458
With the right wine and the right music,
there are damn few that aren't curious.

1:06:55.541 --> 1:06:58.833
And afterwards, we went swimming,

1:06:59.666 --> 1:07:04.333
in the nude, in the dark,
only the moon reflecting the water.

1:07:04.416 --> 1:07:06.166
How romantic.

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:10.500
And the next morning, you took him
his coffee and Alka-Seltzer on a tray.

1:07:13.125 --> 1:07:16.666
I remember I was worried sick all morning
about having to face him,

1:07:17.458 --> 1:07:20.166
but he pretended
like nothing at all had happened.

1:07:20.250 --> 1:07:23.791
Christ, he must have been so drunk,
he didn't remember a thing.

1:07:23.875 --> 1:07:25.416
Odd how that works.

1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:29.458
And now for ten points,
get that liar on the phone.

1:07:34.416 --> 1:07:36.583
- Mmm!
- Oh!

1:07:43.791 --> 1:07:45.041
You know the number?

1:07:46.083 --> 1:07:49.541
Sure, he's back
in Grosse Pointe, living at home.

1:07:49.625 --> 1:07:51.875
Just got separated from his third wife.

1:07:51.958 --> 1:07:53.166
-Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:08:00.541 --> 1:08:02.458
-DA or BY?
-What?

1:08:02.541 --> 1:08:05.625
It's operator lingo.
It means "doesn't answer" or "busy."

1:08:05.708 --> 1:08:07.750
He didn't even give it time
to find out.

1:08:07.833 --> 1:08:11.791
Come on, Bernard. Pick up that phone.

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:15.166
You know you want to call him.
You know that, don't you?

1:08:16.333 --> 1:08:17.333
Well, go ahead.

1:08:18.125 --> 1:08:22.291
Your curiosity's got the best of you now.
So go on, call him.

1:08:44.541 --> 1:08:45.541
Do it.

1:08:56.916 --> 1:08:58.416
-Hello?
- One point.

1:08:59.125 --> 1:09:00.333
Who's speaking?

1:09:03.125 --> 1:09:04.125
Oh!

1:09:04.958 --> 1:09:07.208
-Mrs. Dahlbeck.
- One point.

1:09:07.291 --> 1:09:08.291
It's Bernard.

1:09:11.041 --> 1:09:12.291
Francine's boy.

1:09:13.166 --> 1:09:15.208
- Son, not boy.
-Shh.

1:09:17.833 --> 1:09:20.750
Oh, just fine, thank you.

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:25.666
Mrs. Dahlbeck, is-is… Peter at home?

1:09:30.041 --> 1:09:31.166
Oh.

1:09:33.708 --> 1:09:34.583
Oh, I see.

1:09:34.666 --> 1:09:35.666
Oh, shit.

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:38.000
-Oh, no, no.

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:42.125
Oh, no, no. No, no.
It-It's nothing important. I, um…

1:09:45.708 --> 1:09:47.458
I just wanted to tell him that…

1:09:51.750 --> 1:09:54.833
<i>Just to tell him that I…</i>

1:09:54.916 --> 1:09:59.708
I love him… and I've always loved him.

1:10:06.125 --> 1:10:08.916
That I was very sorry
to hear about him and his wife.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.041
No points.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:13.125
Mama wrote me.

1:10:15.333 --> 1:10:19.166
Yes, it is. It-It-It really is. Well, uh…

1:10:21.291 --> 1:10:25.416
Would you just tell him
that I called and said that I…

1:10:35.166 --> 1:10:36.166
That I, uh…

1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:50.333
I was just very, very sorry to hear

1:10:50.416 --> 1:10:52.916
and hope they can
get everything straightened out.

1:10:55.375 --> 1:10:57.750
Good night. Uh-huh.

1:10:58.666 --> 1:10:59.791
Goodbye.

1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.416
Two points total.

1:11:15.916 --> 1:11:18.125
-Terrible. Next.
-You all right, Bernard?

1:11:19.916 --> 1:11:20.833
Why did I call?

1:11:22.833 --> 1:11:24.166
Why did I do that?

1:11:24.958 --> 1:11:27.291
-Where was he?
-Out on a date.

1:11:29.958 --> 1:11:30.833
Come on.

1:11:31.333 --> 1:11:32.166
Emory.

1:11:34.166 --> 1:11:35.208
Punch in.

1:11:50.583 --> 1:11:52.458
May I have a number, please?

1:11:53.583 --> 1:11:54.708
In the Bronx.

1:11:57.041 --> 1:11:59.583
For a Delbert Botts.

1:11:59.666 --> 1:12:04.083
A Delbert Botts?
How many could there be?

1:12:04.166 --> 1:12:05.916
Wish I hadn't called now.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.750
No, the residence number, please.

1:12:18.708 --> 1:12:19.708
Thank you.

1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:23.125
I do wish Information
would stop calling me "ma'am."

1:12:23.208 --> 1:12:24.666
-Hey, by all means,

1:12:24.750 --> 1:12:26.375
scribble all over my phone.

1:12:26.458 --> 1:12:28.375
It comes off with a little spit.

1:12:28.458 --> 1:12:30.500
Ooh, like a lot of things.

1:12:30.583 --> 1:12:32.541
Who the hell is Delbert Botts?

1:12:32.625 --> 1:12:36.541
The one person I've always loved.
That's who you said to call, isn't it?

1:12:36.625 --> 1:12:37.541
Right, emery board.

1:12:37.625 --> 1:12:41.000
Ugh, how could you love somebody
with a name like that?

1:12:41.583 --> 1:12:46.625
Yes, Emory, you couldn't possibly
love anyone with a name like that.

1:12:46.708 --> 1:12:49.541
That wouldn't look good
on a place card. Right, Alan?

1:12:49.625 --> 1:12:51.500
I admit his name is not so good,

1:12:52.291 --> 1:12:53.250
but he…

1:12:54.416 --> 1:12:56.250
Absolutely beautiful.

1:12:56.333 --> 1:13:00.125
I've loved him ever since
the first day I laid eyes on him,

1:13:01.708 --> 1:13:04.125
which was when I was in the fifth grade

1:13:04.791 --> 1:13:08.291
and he was a senior.

1:13:10.791 --> 1:13:12.666
Then he went away to college,

1:13:12.750 --> 1:13:15.416
and by the time he got out,
I was in high school.

1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:18.875
And he had become… a dentist.

1:13:18.958 --> 1:13:22.958
And you went and had every tooth
in your head pulled out, right?

1:13:23.625 --> 1:13:24.541
No.

1:13:25.750 --> 1:13:27.875
I just had my teeth cleaned, that's all.

1:13:27.958 --> 1:13:31.000
-Oh, I shouldn't have called.
-Will you shut up, Bernard?

1:13:31.083 --> 1:13:34.208
And take your boring, sleep-making icks
somewhere else. Go.

1:13:35.208 --> 1:13:39.458
I remember I looked
right in his eyes the whole time.

1:13:41.291 --> 1:13:43.500
I kept wanting to bite his fingers.

1:13:43.583 --> 1:13:45.625
Well, it's absolutely mind-boggling.

1:13:45.708 --> 1:13:48.916
-Phyllis Phallic.
-It absolutely boggles the mind.

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.833
I told him I was having my teeth cleaned

1:13:51.916 --> 1:13:56.833
for the junior-senior prom
for which I was in charge of decorations.

1:13:58.375 --> 1:14:00.833
<i>I told him</i>
<i>it was a celestial theme,</i>

1:14:00.916 --> 1:14:03.875
<i>and I was cutting stars out of tin foil</i>

1:14:03.958 --> 1:14:08.916
<i>and making clouds</i>
<i>out of chicken wire and angel's hair.</i>

1:14:10.541 --> 1:14:13.875
<i>Oh, Mary, it takes a fairy</i>
<i>to make something pretty.</i>

1:14:13.958 --> 1:14:17.125
I got angel's hair down my shirt
once at Christmastime.

1:14:17.208 --> 1:14:18.458
Gosh, did it itch.

1:14:19.041 --> 1:14:21.541
It would be terrible
if you got that stuff in your…

1:14:24.375 --> 1:14:25.333
I'll be quiet.

1:14:31.416 --> 1:14:35.166
He was engaged
to this stupid-ass girl named Loraine,

1:14:35.250 --> 1:14:37.708
whose mother was truly
a real see-you-next-Tuesday.

1:14:37.791 --> 1:14:39.750
Uh-uh. Don't digress.

1:14:41.166 --> 1:14:45.791
Well, anyway… I was a wreck.
I mean, a total mess.

1:14:45.875 --> 1:14:49.333
I couldn't eat, sleep,
stand up, sit down, nothing.

1:14:50.541 --> 1:14:54.500
Finally, I called him on the phone
and asked if I could see him alone.

1:14:55.375 --> 1:14:57.666
Clearly, not the coolest of moves.

1:14:58.708 --> 1:14:59.833
He said okay.

1:15:00.875 --> 1:15:02.458
Told me to come by his house.

1:15:04.791 --> 1:15:08.958
I was so nervous, my hands were shaking.
I couldn't even look at him.

1:15:09.791 --> 1:15:15.041
I just… stared straight in space
and blurted out why I'd come.

1:15:15.125 --> 1:15:18.500
I told him I wanted him to be my friend.

1:15:19.833 --> 1:15:24.166
I said that I had never
had a friend I could talk to

1:15:24.875 --> 1:15:28.583
and tell everything to and-and trust.

1:15:30.541 --> 1:15:32.291
I asked him if he would be my friend.

1:15:34.208 --> 1:15:36.291
He said he would be glad to be my friend,

1:15:36.875 --> 1:15:40.208
and anytime I wanted
to see him or call him,

1:15:40.291 --> 1:15:42.750
to just call him and he'd see me.

1:15:44.083 --> 1:15:48.166
And he shook my trembling hand,
and I left…

1:15:50.166 --> 1:15:53.125
-on a cloud.
-One of the ones you made yourself.

1:15:53.208 --> 1:15:54.291
And the next day,

1:15:55.083 --> 1:15:57.791
I went out and bought him
a gold-plated cigarette lighter

1:15:57.875 --> 1:15:59.958
and had his initials monogrammed on it.

1:16:00.041 --> 1:16:04.791
I wrote a card that said,
"From your friend, Emory."

1:16:05.375 --> 1:16:08.166
Seventeen years old
and already big with the gifts.

1:16:08.250 --> 1:16:09.958
And then the night of the prom,

1:16:10.833 --> 1:16:15.083
I heard Loraine
and another girl I knew giggling together.

1:16:17.708 --> 1:16:21.666
<i>Obviously, Del had told Loraine</i>
<i>about my calling and about the gift.</i>

1:16:22.833 --> 1:16:25.625
<i>Pretty soon, everybody at the dance</i>
<i>had heard about it.</i>

1:16:26.666 --> 1:16:28.791
<i>They were laughing and making jokes.</i>

1:16:30.791 --> 1:16:34.375
<i>Everybody knew</i>
<i>that I had a crush on Dr. Delbert Botts</i>

1:16:34.958 --> 1:16:37.500
<i>and that I had asked him to be my friend.</i>

1:16:44.208 --> 1:16:46.416
What they didn't know
was that I loved him,

1:16:48.375 --> 1:16:50.125
and that I would go on loving him

1:16:50.208 --> 1:16:55.833
years after they had all forgotten
my funny little secret.

1:16:57.916 --> 1:17:01.500
Well, I for one need an insulin injection.

1:17:01.583 --> 1:17:02.750
Oh.

1:17:07.083 --> 1:17:09.041
-Call him.
-Don't, Emory.

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.958
Since when are you telling him what to do?

1:17:11.041 --> 1:17:13.166
Don't. You'll be sorry.
Take my word for it.

1:17:13.250 --> 1:17:14.875
What have I got to lose?

1:17:14.958 --> 1:17:17.416
Your dignity.
That's what you've got to lose.

1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:19.750
Oh, that's a knee-slapper. I love…

1:17:19.833 --> 1:17:21.791
You're telling him about dignity

1:17:21.875 --> 1:17:24.208
when you allow him
to degrade you constantly

1:17:24.291 --> 1:17:25.916
by Uncle Tom-ing you to death.

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:30.166
He can do it, Michael.
I can do it. But you can't do it.

1:17:30.250 --> 1:17:33.583
Isn't that discrimination?

1:17:33.666 --> 1:17:36.833
I don't like it from him,
and I don't like it from me.

1:17:37.791 --> 1:17:39.458
But I do it to myself,

1:17:40.375 --> 1:17:42.083
and I let him do it.

1:17:42.166 --> 1:17:44.458
I let him do it
because it's the only thing that,

1:17:44.541 --> 1:17:46.333
to him, makes him my equal.

1:17:48.125 --> 1:17:50.500
We both got the short end of the stick,

1:17:50.583 --> 1:17:53.708
but I got a hell of a lot more
than he did, and he knows it.

1:17:53.791 --> 1:17:55.083
I let him Uncle Tom me

1:17:55.166 --> 1:17:58.291
just so he can tell himself
he's not a complete loser.

1:18:00.583 --> 1:18:02.625
How very considerate.

1:18:03.125 --> 1:18:05.208
It's his defense, Michael.

1:18:05.291 --> 1:18:08.083
You have your defense,
but it's indescribable.

1:18:11.708 --> 1:18:17.000
Y'all want to hear a little polite
parlor jest from the liberal Deep South?

1:18:17.083 --> 1:18:20.375
Do you know
why niggers have such big lips?

1:18:20.458 --> 1:18:23.166
Because they're always going…

1:18:23.250 --> 1:18:25.791
Christ, Michael!
Give me that. Let go, Michael.

1:18:27.208 --> 1:18:30.833
I can do without your goddamn spit
on my telephone, you nellie coward!

1:18:30.916 --> 1:18:33.291
I may be nellie, but I'm no coward!

1:18:35.875 --> 1:18:37.041
Yo, Bernard…

1:18:38.375 --> 1:18:39.666
forgive me. I'm sorry.

1:18:39.750 --> 1:18:42.250
I won't ever say
those things to you again.

1:18:56.625 --> 1:18:57.708
Huh.

1:19:03.750 --> 1:19:05.416
-BY.
-It's busy?

1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:07.666
Loraine is probably talking to her mother.

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.208
Oh, yes, Delbert married Loraine.

1:19:11.291 --> 1:19:14.000
I'm sorry, you'll have
to forfeit your turn. We can't wait.

1:19:14.916 --> 1:19:17.041
Well, you're not wasting any time.

1:19:17.708 --> 1:19:19.625
-Who are you calling?
- Charlie.

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:23.791
I refuse to forfeit my turn.
It is my turn, and I'm taking it.

1:19:23.875 --> 1:19:25.750
That's the spirit, Emory.

1:19:25.833 --> 1:19:29.500
You hit that iceberg! Don't miss it.
Hit it! God damn it!

1:19:29.583 --> 1:19:31.500
I want a smash of a finale.

1:19:31.583 --> 1:19:34.666
- God, I'm drunk.
-You're a falling-down-drunk-nellie-queen.

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:36.958
Now that's the pot
calling the kettle beige.

1:19:37.041 --> 1:19:41.000
I am not drunk.
You cannot tell that I am drunk.

1:19:41.083 --> 1:19:42.875
-I'm drunk.
- So am I.

1:19:42.958 --> 1:19:44.708
-I am a major drunk.
-Shut up and dial.

1:19:44.791 --> 1:19:49.125
I'm a major drunk
of this or any other season.

1:19:56.041 --> 1:19:57.708
It's ringing. It's no longer BY.

1:20:00.833 --> 1:20:02.500
-Hello?
- One point.

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.000
Who's speaking?

1:20:07.458 --> 1:20:08.291
Who?

1:20:10.041 --> 1:20:11.375
Dr. Delbert Botts?

1:20:11.458 --> 1:20:12.625
Two points.

1:20:17.458 --> 1:20:19.208
Del, is this really you?

1:20:22.625 --> 1:20:24.791
Nobody.

1:20:28.625 --> 1:20:31.333
Yeah, you don't know me.
You wouldn't remember me.

1:20:32.166 --> 1:20:33.000
Um…

1:20:37.375 --> 1:20:38.666
I'm just a friend.

1:20:40.791 --> 1:20:42.958
A falling-down, drunken friend.

1:20:47.583 --> 1:20:48.708
Hello?

1:20:51.458 --> 1:20:52.458
Hello?

1:20:56.625 --> 1:20:57.625
Hello?

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:13.583
- He hung up.
-Three points total. You're winning.

1:21:13.666 --> 1:21:15.125
He said I must have the wrong party.

1:21:15.208 --> 1:21:17.916
Well, he's right. We have the wrong party.

1:21:19.708 --> 1:21:22.083
It's your party, Hallie.
Having a good time?

1:21:22.166 --> 1:21:23.666
Simply fabulous.

1:21:23.750 --> 1:21:26.291
How about you?
Are you having a good time, Emory?

1:21:26.375 --> 1:21:29.083
Are you having as good a time
as you thought you would?

1:21:35.625 --> 1:21:38.000
-My turn now.
-No, it's my turn to call Charlie.

1:21:38.083 --> 1:21:40.916
No… Let me.

1:21:42.791 --> 1:21:44.333
Are you gonna call Charlie?

1:21:45.250 --> 1:21:46.875
Don't, Hank.

1:21:46.958 --> 1:21:47.958
I want to.

1:21:50.666 --> 1:21:51.541
Larry.

1:21:54.666 --> 1:21:56.458
Be my eager guest.

1:21:58.625 --> 1:22:00.166
Is he gonna call Charlie for you?

1:22:00.750 --> 1:22:03.291
Charlie is all the people
I cheat on Hank with.

1:22:03.375 --> 1:22:05.166
With whom I cheat on Hank.

1:22:05.250 --> 1:22:07.625
The butcher, the baker,
the candlestick maker.

1:22:07.708 --> 1:22:09.666
Right! I love 'em all,

1:22:09.750 --> 1:22:13.083
but what Hank refuses to understand
is I gotta have 'em all.

1:22:13.166 --> 1:22:15.541
I'm not the marrying kind.
I never will be.

1:22:15.625 --> 1:22:16.708
Who're you calling?

1:22:16.791 --> 1:22:18.250
Did it ever occur to you

1:22:18.333 --> 1:22:20.666
that Hank might be doing
the same thing behind your back

1:22:20.750 --> 1:22:21.750
that you do behind his?

1:22:21.833 --> 1:22:25.833
I wish to Christ he would.
Would make life a hell of a lot easier.

1:22:25.916 --> 1:22:26.791
Who are you calling?

1:22:26.875 --> 1:22:30.916
Well, whoever it is, they're not
sitting on top of the telephone.

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.166
-Hello?
-Must have been in the tub.

1:22:33.250 --> 1:22:34.166
One point.

1:22:34.250 --> 1:22:37.416
- I'd like to leave a message.
-Oh, not in. One point.

1:22:37.500 --> 1:22:39.166
Would you say that Hank called?

1:22:40.583 --> 1:22:41.500
Yes, it is.

1:22:43.041 --> 1:22:45.583
-Oh, good evening. How are you?
-Who the hell is that?

1:22:45.666 --> 1:22:48.875
Yes, that's right.
The message is for my roommate, Larry.

1:22:48.958 --> 1:22:50.416
-Just say that I called…

1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:52.458
It's our answering service.

1:22:52.541 --> 1:22:54.916
…and said I love you.

1:22:56.583 --> 1:22:58.000
Hank, are you crazy?

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.583
You heard me correctly.
The message is for Larry.

1:23:01.666 --> 1:23:04.250
It's from me, Hank,
and it is just as I said.

1:23:07.541 --> 1:23:08.583
I love you.

1:23:12.375 --> 1:23:13.291
Yeah, thanks.

1:23:14.583 --> 1:23:16.291
Seven points total.

1:23:16.375 --> 1:23:20.083
Hank, you're ahead, baby!
You're way, way ahead of everybody.

1:23:20.166 --> 1:23:22.416
Why, Hank? Why did you do that?

1:23:23.833 --> 1:23:26.541
Because I do love him,
and I don't care who knows it.

1:23:26.625 --> 1:23:28.916
- Don't say that.
-Why not? It's the truth.

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:32.333
I left my wife and family for Larry.

1:23:32.416 --> 1:23:34.875
-I'm not interested in hearing about it.
-Sure you are.

1:23:34.958 --> 1:23:36.666
Go ahead, Hankola. Tell him all about it.

1:23:36.750 --> 1:23:39.791
-I don't want to hear it! It's disgusting.
-Some men do it for another woman.

1:23:39.875 --> 1:23:42.458
Well, I can understand that.
That's normal.

1:23:45.041 --> 1:23:47.000
It doesn't always work out that way, Alan.

1:23:48.166 --> 1:23:50.833
No matter how you might want it to,
and God knows,

1:23:50.916 --> 1:23:53.000
nobody ever wanted it more than I did.

1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:58.000
I really and truly felt
I was in love with my wife

1:23:58.083 --> 1:23:59.416
when I married her, but…

1:24:01.458 --> 1:24:03.333
there was always that something else.

1:24:03.875 --> 1:24:05.000
Always?

1:24:09.250 --> 1:24:12.083
I don't know. I suppose so.

1:24:12.916 --> 1:24:15.666
I've known what I was
since I was four years old.

1:24:15.750 --> 1:24:18.291
Oh, everybody's always known it
about you, Emory.

1:24:18.375 --> 1:24:20.833
I've always known it about myself, too.

1:24:22.166 --> 1:24:24.666
I don't know
when I first admitted it to myself that…

1:24:27.833 --> 1:24:30.666
I always labeled it something else
or denied it completely.

1:24:30.750 --> 1:24:33.875
Oh. "Christ, was I drunk last night."

1:24:33.958 --> 1:24:36.500
There came a time
where I couldn't lie to myself anymore.

1:24:37.666 --> 1:24:41.291
I thought about it
but never did anything about it.

1:24:44.708 --> 1:24:47.458
The first time
was during my wife's last pregnancy.

1:24:50.375 --> 1:24:52.666
We lived near New Haven in the country.

1:24:52.750 --> 1:24:54.750
There was
this teachers' meeting in New York.

1:24:56.333 --> 1:24:59.875
My wife didn't feel up to the trip.
I came into town on my own and…

1:25:01.625 --> 1:25:04.041
That day on the train,
I began to think about it.

1:25:05.791 --> 1:25:07.041
And think about it.

1:25:08.583 --> 1:25:09.916
And think about it.

1:25:12.541 --> 1:25:14.375
<i>I thought of nothing else the whole trip.</i>

1:25:17.208 --> 1:25:19.208
<i>And then 15 minutes after I had arrived,</i>

1:25:19.291 --> 1:25:22.500
<i>I'd picked up a guy in the men's room</i>
<i>of Grand Central Station.</i>

1:25:22.583 --> 1:25:23.916
Jesus.

1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:26.458
I'd never done
anything like that before.

1:25:28.625 --> 1:25:30.125
<i>I was scared to death.</i>

1:26:02.458 --> 1:26:04.541
<i>He turned out to be a nice fellow.</i>

1:26:07.375 --> 1:26:08.791
<i>I've never seen him again.</i>

1:26:09.750 --> 1:26:10.958
<i>You know, it's funny.</i>

1:26:13.208 --> 1:26:15.250
Can't even remember his name anymore.

1:26:18.333 --> 1:26:20.041
Anyway, after that, it got easier.

1:26:20.125 --> 1:26:22.208
Practice makes perfect.

1:26:22.291 --> 1:26:24.416
Then, sometime later,

1:26:25.791 --> 1:26:28.791
Larry and I met at a party
my wife and I went in town for.

1:26:28.875 --> 1:26:31.541
And your real troubles began.

1:26:31.625 --> 1:26:32.958
That was two years ago.

1:26:35.416 --> 1:26:41.541
Why am I always
the goddamn villain in this piece?

1:26:42.375 --> 1:26:44.666
If I'm not the happy home-wrecker,

1:26:44.750 --> 1:26:47.583
I'm an impossible
son of a bitch to live with.

1:26:47.666 --> 1:26:49.958
Guilt turns to hostility.

1:26:50.666 --> 1:26:53.916
-Isn't that right, Michael?
-Go stick your tweezers in your cheek.

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.708
I'm fed up to the teeth

1:26:55.791 --> 1:26:59.583
with everybody feeling so sorry
for poor, put-upon Hank.

1:26:59.666 --> 1:27:02.166
Aw, Larry, everybody knows
you're Frieda Fickle.

1:27:02.250 --> 1:27:04.541
Hey, I never made any promises.

1:27:04.625 --> 1:27:05.708
I never intend to.

1:27:05.791 --> 1:27:09.333
It's my right to lead my sex life
without answering to anybody,

1:27:09.416 --> 1:27:10.583
Hank included.

1:27:10.666 --> 1:27:15.250
And if those terms aren't acceptable,
then we can't go on living together.

1:27:15.333 --> 1:27:18.000
Numerous relations
is a part of the way I am.

1:27:18.083 --> 1:27:19.833
You don't have to be gay to be a wanton.

1:27:19.916 --> 1:27:24.000
By the way I am,
I don't mean gay. And Emory…

1:27:24.083 --> 1:27:25.958
You are the most
promiscuous person I know.

1:27:26.041 --> 1:27:28.625
-I am not promiscuous at all!

1:27:28.708 --> 1:27:30.666
Not by choice, by design.

1:27:30.750 --> 1:27:33.958
Why would anybody want to go to bed
with a flaming little sissy like you?

1:27:34.041 --> 1:27:35.875
-Michael!
- Who'd make a pass at you?

1:27:35.958 --> 1:27:37.583
I'll tell you who. Nobody.

1:27:37.666 --> 1:27:39.958
Except maybe some fugitive
from the Braille Institute.

1:27:40.041 --> 1:27:43.958
-Why do you let him talk to you that way?
-Physical beauty isn't everything.

1:27:44.041 --> 1:27:46.000
Thank you, Quasimodo.

1:27:46.083 --> 1:27:49.875
What do you think it's like
living with a goddamn Gestapo, huh?

1:27:49.958 --> 1:27:52.375
Can't even take a breath
without getting the third degree.

1:27:52.458 --> 1:27:55.708
-Larry, it's your turn to call.
-And I am so sick of this

1:27:55.791 --> 1:27:59.083
let's-be-faithful-
and-never-look-at-another-person routine.

1:27:59.166 --> 1:28:01.416
That doesn't work.
If you want to promise that, fine.

1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:03.583
Then you promise it, and you stick to it.

1:28:03.666 --> 1:28:05.458
But if you have to promise it,

1:28:05.541 --> 1:28:08.666
as far as I'm concerned,
nothing finishes a relationship faster.

1:28:08.750 --> 1:28:11.208
Give me Librium or give me meth.

1:28:11.291 --> 1:28:12.875
Yeah, freedom, baby! Freedom!

1:28:12.958 --> 1:28:17.125
You got to have it.
It doesn't work any other way.

1:28:17.208 --> 1:28:23.333
And-And the ones who swear their
undying fidelity to each other are lying.

1:28:24.291 --> 1:28:26.500
Most of them, anyway. 90% of them.

1:28:26.583 --> 1:28:29.916
They cheat on each other constantly
and then lie through their teeth.

1:28:30.416 --> 1:28:33.541
I'm sorry I can't be like that.
It drives Hank up the wall.

1:28:33.625 --> 1:28:35.041
There is that 10%.

1:28:35.125 --> 1:28:39.791
The only way it stands a chance
is with some kind of understanding.

1:28:39.875 --> 1:28:41.166
I've tried to go along with that.

1:28:41.833 --> 1:28:43.375
-Come on!
-I agreed to an agreement.

1:28:43.458 --> 1:28:45.291
-Your agreement!
- What agreement?

1:28:45.375 --> 1:28:47.625
A ménage.

1:28:48.375 --> 1:28:51.583
A lot of people think that's the answer,
but that's not my style.

1:28:51.666 --> 1:28:53.041
I certainly didn't want it!

1:28:53.125 --> 1:28:55.000
-Then who suggested it?
-It was a compromise!

1:28:55.083 --> 1:28:56.125
- Exactly!
- You agreed!

1:28:56.208 --> 1:28:57.791
I didn't agree to anything.

1:28:57.875 --> 1:29:01.208
You agreed to your own proposal
and then informed me that I agreed!

1:29:01.291 --> 1:29:02.833
I don't understand. What's a--

1:29:02.916 --> 1:29:04.583
I will kick you!

1:29:04.666 --> 1:29:08.791
The ménage, baby.
Two's company, three's a ménage.

1:29:10.875 --> 1:29:12.083
Oh.

1:29:12.166 --> 1:29:13.458
It works for some.

1:29:13.541 --> 1:29:15.958
-Well, I'm not one for group therapy.

1:29:16.041 --> 1:29:18.583
I can't relate to anyone
or anything like that.

1:29:19.458 --> 1:29:20.458
I'm old-fashioned.

1:29:20.541 --> 1:29:23.583
I like 'em all,
but I like 'em one at a time.

1:29:24.375 --> 1:29:27.958
Did you like Donald
as a single side attraction?

1:29:53.875 --> 1:29:54.958
Yes.

1:29:58.291 --> 1:30:00.416
-Did you tell him?
-No.

1:30:00.500 --> 1:30:03.000
It was perfectly obvious
from the moment you walked in.

1:30:03.083 --> 1:30:04.416
What was that song and dance

1:30:04.500 --> 1:30:06.958
about having seen each other
but never having met?

1:30:07.583 --> 1:30:09.250
Don't look at me like that, Hank.

1:30:11.583 --> 1:30:14.708
You've been playing footsie
with that penguin all night.

1:30:14.791 --> 1:30:17.000
Oh! I suppose you want the three of us
to have a go at it.

1:30:17.083 --> 1:30:19.833
-At least that would be together.
-Well, that point eludes me.

1:30:19.916 --> 1:30:22.250
What kind of an understanding do you want?

1:30:22.333 --> 1:30:23.500
Respect!

1:30:23.583 --> 1:30:27.666
Respect for each other's freedom
without any need to lie or pretend.

1:30:27.750 --> 1:30:30.125
Hank, in my way, I love you,

1:30:30.208 --> 1:30:33.208
but you have to understand
although I want to live with you,

1:30:33.291 --> 1:30:34.833
sometimes there might be others.

1:30:34.916 --> 1:30:37.333
If that happens,
I know I'll never mention it.

1:30:37.416 --> 1:30:40.666
But if you ask me, I will tell you.

1:30:40.750 --> 1:30:42.041
He gets points!

1:30:42.666 --> 1:30:43.500
What?

1:30:44.750 --> 1:30:47.458
He said it. He said "I love you" to Hank.
He gets the bonus.

1:30:47.541 --> 1:30:49.458
-He didn't call him.
-He called him.

1:30:49.541 --> 1:30:50.916
He just didn't use the telephone.

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:54.291
- Then he doesn't get any points.
-He gets five points.

1:30:54.375 --> 1:30:57.583
He didn't use the telephone.
He doesn't get a goddamn thing!

1:31:16.833 --> 1:31:18.541
It's for you, Hank!

1:31:31.208 --> 1:31:32.041
Hello?

1:31:32.625 --> 1:31:33.500
One point.

1:31:36.791 --> 1:31:38.208
Hello, Hank.

1:31:39.125 --> 1:31:40.208
Two points.

1:31:42.333 --> 1:31:43.625
This is Larry.

1:31:44.750 --> 1:31:46.333
- Two more points.

1:31:48.458 --> 1:31:50.791
For what it's worth, I love you.

1:31:53.333 --> 1:31:54.583
Five-point bonus.

1:31:57.041 --> 1:31:57.875
I'll…

1:31:59.666 --> 1:32:00.750
I'll try.

1:32:10.375 --> 1:32:11.500
I will, too.

1:32:16.875 --> 1:32:20.041
-That's ten points total.
-Larry is the winner.

1:32:22.916 --> 1:32:26.083
Well, that wasn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

1:32:26.166 --> 1:32:27.875
Game isn't over yet.

1:32:28.666 --> 1:32:32.291
It's your turn, Alan.
Pick up the phone, buster.

1:32:32.375 --> 1:32:33.750
-Michael, don't.
-Stay out of this!

1:32:33.833 --> 1:32:35.583
You don't have to, Alan. You don't.

1:32:35.666 --> 1:32:40.000
Emory, I'm sorry for what I did before.

1:32:41.958 --> 1:32:42.958
Forget it.

1:32:43.541 --> 1:32:45.625
Forgive us our trespasses.

1:32:45.708 --> 1:32:46.791
Christ.

1:32:46.875 --> 1:32:48.916
You guys joined at the goddamn hip now?

1:32:49.708 --> 1:32:52.541
Who are you going to call, Alan? Hmm?

1:32:56.708 --> 1:32:58.166
Can't remember anyone?

1:32:59.916 --> 1:33:03.250
I believe this will be the final round.

1:33:03.833 --> 1:33:06.125
Michael, aren't you gonna call anyone?

1:33:06.958 --> 1:33:10.583
How could he? He's never loved anyone.

1:33:15.958 --> 1:33:18.666
<i>♪ No matter how you figure</i>
<i>It's tough to be a nigger ♪</i>

1:33:18.750 --> 1:33:22.708
- Stop that, Michael!
<i>-♪ But it's tougher to be a Jew ♪</i>

1:33:22.791 --> 1:33:25.666
My God, Michael, you're a charming host.

1:33:25.750 --> 1:33:28.250
Michael doesn't have charm, Donald.

1:33:29.166 --> 1:33:32.208
Michael has counter-charm.

1:33:34.333 --> 1:33:37.291
-Wait, are you going somewhere?
-Yes, excuse me.

1:33:37.375 --> 1:33:39.458
You're going to miss the end of the game.

1:33:40.041 --> 1:33:42.541
With any luck,
I won't be down until it's all over.

1:34:09.291 --> 1:34:12.583
What do you suppose
is going on up there, hmm, Alan?

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.208
What do you imagine that Larry and Hank
are doing up there, hmm?

1:34:18.291 --> 1:34:20.833
Whatever they're doing,
they aren't hurting anyone.

1:34:20.916 --> 1:34:22.875
And they're minding their own business.

1:34:22.958 --> 1:34:25.125
Yeah, and you mind yours, Harold.
I'm warning you.

1:34:27.041 --> 1:34:28.166
Are you, now?

1:34:29.666 --> 1:34:31.041
Are you warning me?

1:34:32.958 --> 1:34:33.791
Me?

1:34:40.625 --> 1:34:41.875
I'm Harold.

1:34:43.833 --> 1:34:46.166
I'm the one person
you don't warn, Michael,

1:34:46.250 --> 1:34:48.125
because you and I are a match.

1:34:49.541 --> 1:34:52.708
And we tread very softly with each other

1:34:52.791 --> 1:34:55.583
because we both play
each other's game too well.

1:34:57.208 --> 1:35:00.083
I know this game you're playing.

1:35:01.666 --> 1:35:04.500
I know it very well,
and I play it very well.

1:35:04.583 --> 1:35:06.875
You play it very well, too,
but you know what?

1:35:08.416 --> 1:35:12.583
I'm the only one
who's better at it than you are.

1:35:12.666 --> 1:35:15.500
I can beat you at it, so don't push me.

1:35:18.125 --> 1:35:21.750
I'm warning <i>you.</i>

1:35:34.208 --> 1:35:35.416
You're funny, Hallie.

1:35:36.125 --> 1:35:38.416
You're a laugh riot. Isn't he funny, Alan?

1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:41.375
Or as you might say, "Isn't he amusing?"

1:35:41.458 --> 1:35:43.500
He's an amusing faggot, isn't he?

1:35:44.375 --> 1:35:46.375
Or, as you might say, freak.

1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.875
That's what you called Emory, wasn't it?
A freak, a pansy.

1:35:51.458 --> 1:35:54.708
God, what an antiquated vocabulary
you have.

1:35:54.791 --> 1:35:58.166
I'm surprised you didn't say
"sodomite" or "pederast."

1:35:58.250 --> 1:36:00.333
You better let me bring you up to date.

1:36:00.416 --> 1:36:03.458
Have you ever heard
the term "closet-queen"?

1:36:03.541 --> 1:36:04.791
You know what that means?

1:36:05.333 --> 1:36:08.666
Do you know what it means
to be "in the closet"?

1:36:08.750 --> 1:36:11.041
If you're insinuating
that I'm a homosexual,

1:36:11.125 --> 1:36:13.041
I can only say that you're mistaken.

1:36:14.250 --> 1:36:15.208
Am I?

1:36:19.208 --> 1:36:21.208
What about Justin Stuart?

1:36:21.791 --> 1:36:22.916
What about Justin Stuart?

1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.916
You were in love with him,
that's what about him.

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000
And that is who you are going to call.

1:36:28.083 --> 1:36:30.875
Justin and I were very good friends.
That's all.

1:36:30.958 --> 1:36:34.416
According to Justin,
that friendship was quite passionate.

1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:35.458
What do you mean?

1:36:35.541 --> 1:36:37.875
I mean that you slept with him
in college several times.

1:36:37.958 --> 1:36:39.875
-That's not true.
- Several times.

1:36:39.958 --> 1:36:42.833
One time, it's youth.
Twice is a phase, maybe.

1:36:42.916 --> 1:36:45.208
Several times, you like it.

1:36:45.291 --> 1:36:47.500
-It's not true.
- Yes, it is!

1:36:47.583 --> 1:36:50.250
Because Justin Stuart is a homosexual!

1:36:51.541 --> 1:36:53.916
He comes to New York on occasion,
and he calls me.

1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:55.375
I've taken him to parties.

1:36:55.458 --> 1:36:59.250
Larry had him once,
and he has told me all about you.

1:36:59.333 --> 1:37:00.750
Then he told you a lie.

1:37:00.833 --> 1:37:03.625
You were obsessed with Justin.

1:37:03.708 --> 1:37:07.208
That is all you talked about
morning, noon and night.

1:37:07.291 --> 1:37:10.666
You started doing it
about Hank upstairs tonight.

1:37:10.750 --> 1:37:13.416
"What an attractive fella he is."
All that transparent crap.

1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:17.833
-I said he was attractive. That's all.
-How many times do you have to say it?

1:37:17.916 --> 1:37:21.541
How many times
did you have to say it about Justin?

1:37:21.625 --> 1:37:25.000
What a good tennis player he was,
what a good dancer he was,

1:37:25.083 --> 1:37:28.125
what a good body he had,
how bright he was,

1:37:28.208 --> 1:37:32.583
how amusing he was,
how-how the girls were all mad for him,

1:37:32.666 --> 1:37:34.666
what close friends you were.

1:37:34.750 --> 1:37:37.083
We were very close, very good friends.
That's all.

1:37:37.166 --> 1:37:39.000
It was obvious.

1:37:39.083 --> 1:37:42.458
And when you did it around Fran,
it was downright embarrassing.

1:37:42.541 --> 1:37:45.291
-Even she must have her doubts about you.
-Justin lied.

1:37:46.416 --> 1:37:48.083
If he told you that, he lied.

1:37:48.166 --> 1:37:51.291
He'd say anything about me now
to get even.

1:37:52.041 --> 1:37:54.625
He could never get over
the fact that I dropped him.

1:37:54.708 --> 1:37:56.708
You ended the friendship, Alan,

1:37:57.500 --> 1:38:00.333
because you couldn't face
the truth about yourself.

1:38:00.416 --> 1:38:04.541
You could go on sleeping with Justin
as long as he lied to himself

1:38:04.625 --> 1:38:06.291
and you lied to yourself.

1:38:06.375 --> 1:38:10.541
And you both dated girls
and you labeled yourselves men

1:38:10.625 --> 1:38:12.916
and you called yourselves
"just fond friends,"

1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.916
but Justin finally had to be honest,
and you couldn't take it.

1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.916
-You couldn't take it, and so…
-No.

1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.666
…you destroyed the friendship
and your friend along with it.

1:38:21.750 --> 1:38:22.708
- No.
-Oh, yes.

1:38:22.791 --> 1:38:27.250
Justin never understood what he had
done wrong to make you drop him.

1:38:27.333 --> 1:38:28.541
-He blamed himself.
- No.

1:38:28.625 --> 1:38:31.875
He did,
until he eventually found out who he was.

1:38:31.958 --> 1:38:33.041
-And what he was.
- No!

1:38:33.125 --> 1:38:36.500
But to this day,
he still remembers the treatment.

1:38:36.583 --> 1:38:38.291
-Scars he got from you.
-No.

1:38:38.375 --> 1:38:41.083
You pick up this phone,
and you call Justin.

1:38:41.166 --> 1:38:42.000
No.

1:38:42.083 --> 1:38:44.250
I want you to call him and apologize.

1:38:44.333 --> 1:38:47.416
You tell him what you should have
told him many years ago.

1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:50.250
-He lied. Not a word of it is true!
- Call him!

1:38:53.041 --> 1:38:54.666
All right, then I'll dial.

1:38:56.541 --> 1:38:58.375
You're so helpful.

1:38:59.708 --> 1:39:00.750
Give it to me.

1:39:34.625 --> 1:39:35.458
Hello?

1:39:36.041 --> 1:39:37.083
One point.

1:39:39.041 --> 1:39:40.250
It's Alan.

1:39:40.333 --> 1:39:41.291
Two points.

1:39:43.708 --> 1:39:46.041
-Yes. Yes, it's me.
- Is that Justin?

1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.291
- You sound surprised.

1:39:49.375 --> 1:39:51.625
I should hope to think so,
after all this time.

1:39:51.708 --> 1:39:52.541
Two more points.

1:39:54.083 --> 1:39:55.166
I'm in New York.

1:39:57.416 --> 1:39:58.541
Yes, I…

1:40:01.333 --> 1:40:03.333
I won't explain now, I just…

1:40:05.583 --> 1:40:06.791
called to tell you…

1:40:09.625 --> 1:40:13.125
That I love you. God damn it, I love you.

1:40:16.875 --> 1:40:18.041
I love you.

1:40:18.125 --> 1:40:22.333
You get the goddamn bonus.
Ten points total. Jackpot!

1:40:22.416 --> 1:40:25.958
-I love you, and I beg you to forgive me.
-Give me that. Give me that!

1:40:26.041 --> 1:40:28.958
Justin, did you hear
what that son of a bitch said?

1:40:33.958 --> 1:40:34.833
Fran.

1:40:36.708 --> 1:40:40.625
No, of course I knew it was you.

1:40:41.125 --> 1:40:42.333
How are you?

1:40:44.416 --> 1:40:45.250
Yes.

1:40:46.125 --> 1:40:47.750
Yes, he told me everything.

1:40:49.208 --> 1:40:51.250
No, now, don't thank me.

1:40:51.333 --> 1:40:53.375
Please. Please, don't thank me.

1:40:57.125 --> 1:40:59.416
I'll put him back on.

1:41:03.625 --> 1:41:04.916
My love to the kids.

1:41:15.958 --> 1:41:18.791
Darling, I'll take
the first plane I can get.

1:41:20.166 --> 1:41:21.666
Yes, I'm sorry, too.

1:41:23.708 --> 1:41:24.958
I love you very much.

1:41:54.333 --> 1:41:55.625
Thank you, Michael.

1:42:09.833 --> 1:42:10.791
Who won?

1:42:11.958 --> 1:42:13.625
It was a tie.

1:42:21.416 --> 1:42:24.833
-Now, it is my turn.

1:42:27.958 --> 1:42:30.291
And ready or not, Michael, here goes.

1:42:34.041 --> 1:42:39.541
You are a sad… and pathetic man.

1:42:43.083 --> 1:42:46.208
You're a homosexual,
and you don't want to be.

1:42:48.541 --> 1:42:51.250
But there is
nothing you can do to change it.

1:42:53.583 --> 1:42:56.958
Not all your prayers to your God,

1:42:58.708 --> 1:43:04.208
not all the analysis you can buy
in all the years you have yet to live.

1:43:06.375 --> 1:43:11.583
We may very well one day be able to know
what it is to live a heterosexual life

1:43:12.958 --> 1:43:15.000
if you want it desperately enough,

1:43:17.208 --> 1:43:21.666
if you pursue it with the fervor
with which you annihilate.

1:43:28.083 --> 1:43:31.875
But you will always be homosexual as well.

1:43:35.791 --> 1:43:37.333
Always, Michael.

1:43:40.666 --> 1:43:41.625
Always.

1:43:44.541 --> 1:43:46.708
Until the day you die.

1:43:53.958 --> 1:43:55.916
Oh, friends…

1:43:57.500 --> 1:44:01.333
thank you for a nifty party
and a super gift.

1:44:01.416 --> 1:44:04.000
It's just what I needed.

1:44:11.541 --> 1:44:13.625
Bernard, thank you.

1:44:17.375 --> 1:44:18.791
And you'll get him home?

1:44:18.875 --> 1:44:22.333
Don't worry about her.
I'll take care of everything.

1:44:25.708 --> 1:44:27.125
Good to see you, Donald.

1:44:27.625 --> 1:44:28.708
Good night, Harold.

1:44:29.958 --> 1:44:32.583
-See you again sometime.
-Yeah.

1:44:35.291 --> 1:44:37.500
How about a year from Shavuot?

1:44:39.333 --> 1:44:42.041
Come on, Tex. Let's go to my place.

1:44:45.875 --> 1:44:47.541
Are you good in bed?

1:44:49.458 --> 1:44:53.083
Well… I try to show a little affection.

1:44:55.458 --> 1:44:57.750
Keeps me from feeling like such a whore.

1:45:03.333 --> 1:45:06.208
Uh, Michael, thanks for the laughs.

1:45:13.833 --> 1:45:14.958
Call you tomorrow.

1:45:21.583 --> 1:45:23.583
Come on, Bernard. Time to go home.

1:45:24.125 --> 1:45:26.083
Mary, you're a heavy mother.

1:45:27.375 --> 1:45:29.625
Why'd I call?

1:45:31.708 --> 1:45:33.750
-Why?
-Hey, thank you, Michael.

1:45:33.833 --> 1:45:35.833
-Good night, Donald.
- Good night, Emory.

1:45:42.375 --> 1:45:44.250
I'm gonna
take you for some coffee,

1:45:44.333 --> 1:45:46.166
and everything's gonna be all right.

1:45:46.250 --> 1:45:48.625
-Careful.

1:46:12.791 --> 1:46:13.625
Donald?

1:46:14.416 --> 1:46:16.958
-Donald, Donald. Donald?
-Michael?

1:46:17.041 --> 1:46:19.625
-Oh, my God, what have I done?
-Christ, Michael.

1:46:19.708 --> 1:46:21.458
-Oh, God.
-Michael, I'm not--

1:46:21.541 --> 1:46:24.125
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1:46:24.208 --> 1:46:26.583
-Hey, hey.
-God, Donald. Oh, my God, no!

1:46:26.666 --> 1:46:29.458
-I'll get you some water. Here.
-God, what have I done?

1:46:29.541 --> 1:46:31.250
-Hey, stop it. Stop it.
-Jesus, God.

1:46:31.333 --> 1:46:32.750
I'm gonna give you a Valium.

1:46:32.833 --> 1:46:35.750
-No! Not pills and alcohol. I'm gonna die!
-I'm not…

1:46:35.833 --> 1:46:37.750
Come on, take this. You're scaring me.

1:46:37.833 --> 1:46:39.166
Stop that crying. Take this pill.

1:46:44.291 --> 1:46:45.875
Come here.
Come here, Michael.

1:46:45.958 --> 1:46:48.625
-Come here, Michael! Come here!
-Get off of me!

1:46:48.708 --> 1:46:49.666
Jesus Christ.

1:46:55.833 --> 1:46:58.708
-Hey.

1:46:59.916 --> 1:47:00.916
It's okay.

1:47:02.375 --> 1:47:03.333
It's okay.

1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:09.416
It's okay.

1:47:13.375 --> 1:47:14.458
Hey, it's okay.

1:47:17.083 --> 1:47:17.958
It's okay.

1:47:26.166 --> 1:47:28.125
Who was it that always used to say,

1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:33.583
"Show me a happy homosexual,
and I'll show you a gay corpse"?

1:47:35.541 --> 1:47:36.500
I don't know.

1:47:37.500 --> 1:47:39.458
Who was it who always used to say that?

1:47:43.416 --> 1:47:46.291
If we could
just not hate ourselves so much.

1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.916
That's it, you know?

1:47:53.041 --> 1:47:54.208
If we could just…

1:47:55.333 --> 1:47:59.083
Oh. If we could just learn
not to hate ourselves…

1:48:00.291 --> 1:48:01.916
quite so very much.

1:48:03.958 --> 1:48:04.916
Yes, I know.

1:48:08.083 --> 1:48:10.083
-I know.

1:48:24.416 --> 1:48:25.250
Okay.

1:48:37.958 --> 1:48:40.291
By the way,
I think your analyst is a quack.

1:48:42.333 --> 1:48:46.625
-Earlier, you said he was a prick.
-That's right. He's a prick quack.

1:48:46.708 --> 1:48:49.041
-Or a quack prick. Whichever you prefer.
-Okay.

1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:55.375
Harold was right.

1:49:01.333 --> 1:49:02.750
You'll never change.

1:49:28.958 --> 1:49:32.750
You suppose there's any possibility
of just flushing this place?

1:49:38.041 --> 1:49:39.125
What time is it?

1:49:39.916 --> 1:49:41.000
It's early.

1:49:44.916 --> 1:49:46.000
Where are you going?

1:49:48.708 --> 1:49:50.625
The bedroom's <i>ocupado,</i>

1:49:51.583 --> 1:49:53.708
and I don't want
to go to sleep yet anyway.

1:49:54.958 --> 1:49:56.875
I'm gonna try and walk off this booze.

1:49:57.375 --> 1:49:58.791
If I went to sleep right now,

1:49:58.875 --> 1:50:01.875
when I woke up,
they'd have to put me in a padded cell.

1:50:02.750 --> 1:50:04.625
Not that that's where I don't belong.

1:50:10.458 --> 1:50:12.708
There's a midnight mass
over at St. Malachy's

1:50:12.791 --> 1:50:14.583
that all the show people go to. I th--

1:50:15.250 --> 1:50:17.125
I think I'll walk over and catch it.

1:50:20.333 --> 1:50:21.916
Well, pray for me.

1:50:25.375 --> 1:50:27.291
Maybe they'll be gone when I get back.

1:50:31.791 --> 1:50:33.791
Will I see you again next Saturday?

1:50:36.583 --> 1:50:38.125
Unless you have other plans.

1:50:41.916 --> 1:50:42.875
No.

1:50:44.625 --> 1:50:46.250
- Michael.
-What?

1:50:47.916 --> 1:50:50.333
Did he ever tell you
why he was crying on the phone?

1:50:50.416 --> 1:50:51.333
No.

1:50:52.541 --> 1:50:54.458
It must have been that he'd left Fran.

1:50:56.500 --> 1:50:59.500
Or maybe it was something else,
and he changed his mind.

1:50:59.583 --> 1:51:00.708
Maybe so.

1:51:03.333 --> 1:51:04.750
I wonder why he left her.

1:51:07.916 --> 1:51:10.833
As my father said to me
when he died in my arms,

1:51:12.916 --> 1:51:14.708
"I don't understand any of it."

1:51:15.708 --> 1:51:16.958
"I never did."

1:51:18.500 --> 1:51:20.625
Turn out the lights
when you leave, will you?

1:52:31.291 --> 1:52:33.208
What? Oh.
