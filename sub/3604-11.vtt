this guy to come back

Look, maybe
that's a good thing.

Samedi's abilities are
gone, too. He's not
invulnerable anymore.

01:30.508 --> 01:34.217
That does not make him
powerless. His followers
think he's a god.

01:34.303 --> 01:37.841
Then I say we make him bleed.
We show them he's not a god.

01:38.975 --> 01:40.431
Why did you
come here, Peter?

01:40.518 --> 01:42.054

I'm not.

who he is because
you helped create him.

the last story.

34:31.779 --> 34:32.814
What do you mean?

34:35.574 --> 34:37.656
There's a legend
I heard from a guy
at a convention,

34:37.743 --> 34:40.359
who heard it from a dude,
who heard it
from another dude,

34:40.454 --> 34:43.446

story exists.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.620
Where?

34:45.668 --> 34:46.783
The day that he died,

34:46.877 --> 34:50.665
Isaac Mendez bequeathed
his sketchbook to
a humble bike messenger.

Pete, you've always made

I haven't agreed with
all of them, but they've
always come from your heart.

I respect that.
And I'm sorry...

35:45.185 --> 35:48.769

It's got nothing
to do with Dad.

Look, I'm never
gonna forgive him
for what he did to us,

36:00.284 --> 36:05.404
but his idea,
giving people abilities,
the right people...

36:05.497 --> 36:07.954

It's not wrong, Pete.

36:08.459 --> 36:09.824

nearly did to this country.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.169
Yeah, but we stopped him.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.873
We didn't do anything.
He did.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.550
Because he still had power.

That was just one village.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.068
Don't we have
an obligation
to try and stop it?

36:38.155 --> 36:39.986
Yes, we do,
but not like this.

36:40.074 --> 36:41.234
Then how?

36:43.660 --> 36:45.912
Pinehearst has a way, Pete.

36:45.996 --> 36:49.159
It's not perfect,
not yet,

36:51.126 --> 36:54.459
but if we don't try
and stop what's
happening in the world,

36:54.546 --> 36:58.084
then we're just
as guilty as the people
who are committing the crime.
