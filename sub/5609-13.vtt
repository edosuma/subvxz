when you steal from a witch, witch?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.784
Fair enough.
So, who are you looking for?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.751
His name's Hercules.
You know, from the myths.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.292
(CHUCKLES) I know who Hercules is.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.916
He comes in here
on his lunch break every day,

14:05.428 --> 14:07.589
and no matter
how hard I try to fatten him up,

14:07.638 --> 14:11.256
his muscles are always bulging.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.472
It's a shame,
he'd make a great Sunday roast.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.344
Lunch break from where?

14:20.109 --> 14:21.269
Herc?

14:27.784 --> 14:29.866
You don't recognize me, do you?

14:33.623 --> 14:34.988
Snow?

14:36.793 --> 14:37.828
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

14:46.344 --> 14:48.175
You're still so young.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.386
When... How...

14:52.558 --> 14:55.391
You mean, uh, how did I die?

14:55.686 --> 14:57.551
That's, uh... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

14:59.148 --> 15:00.888
Uh, that's, that's not important.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.975
What are you doing down here?
I mean, how did you...

15:05.530 --> 15:06.565
I'm not dead.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.031
Um, I came down here
to help my daughter.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.368
You have a daughter?

15:14.497 --> 15:15.828
And a son.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.748
And a grandson, actually.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.124
(CHUCKLES)

15:21.170 --> 15:23.206
-You are not a grandmother.
-(LAUGHS)

15:23.881 --> 15:25.166
Actually,

15:26.050 --> 15:29.918
it's kind of a convoluted story,
but, um, I am.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.262
It's been quite a life.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.680
Yeah.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.760
Yeah, I wish I could say the same.
(CHUCKLES)

15:40.523 --> 15:42.013
I'm so sorry.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.184
What if I told you
there might be a way for you

15:46.320 --> 15:48.026
to leave the UndenNorld
once and for all?

15:48.406 --> 15:51.068
I never finished my Labors.
I can't move on until I do.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.658
I know. And Cerberus is here.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.907
Wha... Here?

15:57.707 --> 15:59.538
He's, he's guarding a prison

15:59.584 --> 16:01.415
where the man my daughter
loves is being held and...

16:03.754 --> 16:06.882
Hercules, you're the only one
strong enough to defeat that beast.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.334
It's your destiny.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.718
(SIGHS) Well, that hero died.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.224
Only if you let him.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.927
Don't forget what you taught me.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.230
"You can't let fear of failure
keep you from trying."

16:35.036 --> 16:36.242
(GRUNTS)

16:36.746 --> 16:40.113
Oh. This is going to be
quite an exciting day.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.913
(GROANS) It will be... When I kill you.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.713
(CHUCKLES) Why does
everyone say that?

16:48.758 --> 16:51.750
You can't kill me. I'm Hades.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.754
This... This is death.

16:56.474 --> 17:01.093
Well, then I'll find whatever's worse
and do it to you.

17:05.066 --> 17:09.730
Oh. I see you've... You've met my pet.

17:09.779 --> 17:14.648
You're about to realize his master
is not nearly as friendly.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.785
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:23.960 --> 17:25.416
Wait.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.126
Protection spell.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.463
Looks like Grandma Cora
left this place locked up.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.802
Not completely.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.516
(GRUNTS)

17:48.317 --> 17:49.432
Okay...

17:49.944 --> 17:51.809
(GRUNTS) you stay here.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.893
No.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.488
Someone needs to stand guard outside.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.650
And only one of us knows
where to look in my mom's office.

18:01.956 --> 18:02.991
Be very careful.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.672
CRUELLA: Hello, darling.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.549
Cruella.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.384
Tell me, how's your mother?

18:19.974 --> 18:22.841
Oh, yes, with you,
I need to be more specific.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.384
How is the one that killed me?

18:26.647 --> 18:28.228
This is the tunnel
she said she came out of.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.564
Hook's in here somewhere.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.901
All right, Wonderboy,
are you sure you can do this?

18:34.030 --> 18:35.019
Regina.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.151
I know you can do this.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.067
We'll find your friend. Don't worry.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.570
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:47.918 --> 18:49.874
Wait for me here.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.548
Hmm.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.091
Where's the rest of it?

19:06.062 --> 19:10.055
That's all we have. I swear.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.436
Leave my people alone.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.860
Princess Snow, please help us.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.741
Where's your daddy's army?

19:24.580 --> 19:27.242
I don't need an army.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.410
Return what you've taken
from these people

19:29.460 --> 19:31.542
and leave my kingdom...

19:32.129 --> 19:33.710
(INDISTINCT MURMURS)

19:35.925 --> 19:37.961

lands in your good eye.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.383
(SCOFFS)

19:40.221 --> 19:42.257
I'd like to see you try.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.303
(LAUGHS)

19:57.780 --> 20:02.274
Run back to your palace, little girl.
These are my woods now.

(LOUD THUD)

20:07.623 --> 20:08.908
(GRUNTS)

20:08.958 --> 20:10.414
Leave her alone!

20:13.129 --> 20:14.835
You're going to have to answer to me.

20:22.513 --> 20:25.926
Your boyfriend won't be around
to protect you forever.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.440
We did exactly what you asked.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.988
There's more where this came from.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.445
Are you sure
you don't want me to kill her?

20:45.494 --> 20:49.988
I won't turn her into a martyr
for these people to worship.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.159
No.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.034
l have to turn them against her.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.876
Then these miserable people
will finally realize the truth.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.508
I am meant to be their queen.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.431
(WATER TRICKLING)

-Come on.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.255
Whoa.

(CERBERUS GROWLING)

21:56.607 --> 21:57.722
(HADES WHISTLES)

22:01.028 --> 22:02.234
What the hell was that?

22:02.279 --> 22:04.531
HADES: I called them off.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.196
Who are you?

22:10.246 --> 22:11.577
My uncle.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.620
Hades?

22:13.749 --> 22:15.865
Don't look so surprised.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.125
Who'd you think was in charge
of this place, your mommy?

22:18.754 --> 22:22.292
Well, if this is your realm,
maybe you can answer a few questions.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.587
Like, why does this hellhole
look like Storybrooke?

22:26.136 --> 22:29.469
l have my reasons,
and I don't have to share them with you.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.429
Leave them alone, Uncle.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.763
There's that famous courage
people love to talk about.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.604
Oh, Hercules, did you really think
you could face Cerberus again?

22:39.608 --> 22:40.597
Again?

22:40.943 --> 22:43.480
(GASPS) You mean, he didn't tell you?

22:47.074 --> 22:49.156
Cerberus killed you.

22:49.577 --> 22:53.991
Yeah, I didn't want you to know.
Snow, I couldn't let you down.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.244
Well, it's nothing to be
ashamed of, nephew.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.160
After all, losing your life
to my little pet

23:00.296 --> 23:02.582
is what finally
brought us together as family.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.796
We're not afraid of you.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.798
(GASPS) Oh.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.921
Snow White.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.505
(GASPS) Or is it Mary Margaret?

23:12.808 --> 23:13.843
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

23:13.934 --> 23:16.175
My nephew said you were a spitfire.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.429
But trust me,
you should be quite afraid of me.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.644
Because the next time
you interfere with my family,

23:22.693 --> 23:24.479
I will come after yours.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.779
Bring it. We're not gonna rest
until we find Hook.

23:29.325 --> 23:32.158
Oh, and that must make you Emma.

23:32.661 --> 23:37.200
(CHUCKLES) Since your pirate
likes to send you messages,

23:37.333 --> 23:41.201
I told him
I would deliver this one personally.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.502
What did you do to him?

23:49.470 --> 23:52.633
It's not what I've already done
you should worry about, no.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.848
It's what I'm about to do.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.009
(CLATTERS)

24:03.734 --> 24:06.441
So, darling,
this is actually quite fortuitous.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.019
What do you want?

24:08.155 --> 24:11.147
Why, you, of course. I need your help.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.159
You see, Hades,
the being that runs this place,

24:15.204 --> 24:16.865
has set up the most awful conundrum.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.030
For those of us
in this ghastly UndenNorld,

24:20.167 --> 24:22.158
we have two choices,

24:22.211 --> 24:26.705
leaving for a better place,
or a worse one.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.543
I think I know where you'll end up.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.501
(SIGHS) Charming. Just like your family.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.545
And also probably quite correct.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.884
Which is why I need a third choice.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.387
To go back to the real world.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.055
Oh, how I miss it.

24:41.772 --> 24:44.730
The music, the gin, the glamour...

24:45.567 --> 24:46.602
The gin.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.568
You're already dead.
No one can change that.

24:49.613 --> 24:54.073
Actually, one person can. The Author.
Oh, yes, that's you now.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.567
No, the Apprentice told me
it's impossible.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.069
Because he didn't want you to.

24:58.956 --> 25:01.743
But, Henry, you can.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.578
The Author's power is far greater

25:03.711 --> 25:06.202
than that bearded old man
wanted you to believe.

25:06.547 --> 25:07.753
l destroyed the quill.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.123
Oh, yes, yes. I know what you did.
We hear it all down here.

25:12.136 --> 25:15.628
But I'm guessing you don't know
much about the quill, do you?

25:16.473 --> 25:18.589
The Sorcerer bequeathed the quill
to all of you,

25:18.726 --> 25:20.432
but it is not a simple pen.

25:20.561 --> 25:24.725
It is a magical energy.
It is a living, breathing entity.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.389
It's alive?

25:26.692 --> 25:27.932
Oh, yes.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.900
And when you broke it, Henry,

25:30.612 --> 25:33.604
you sent it right down here
to the UndenNorld,

25:33.741 --> 25:35.606
its purpose unfulfilled.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.279
It epitomized "unfinished business."

25:39.246 --> 25:43.080
And now, you're going to
find it down here, with my help,

25:43.125 --> 25:46.663
and you're going to send me
right back to our world.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.418
Why would I ever help you?

25:48.797 --> 25:54.133
Mmm. Because, Henry, ifl come
back to life, guess what happens?

25:55.137 --> 25:59.176
The woman who killed me, your mother,
is no longer a murderer.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.264
You see?

26:02.519 --> 26:05.101
You see, by helping me, Henry,

26:05.147 --> 26:10.107
you can restore Mommy Dearest
to the pure soul she once was.

26:10.152 --> 26:13.610
You can save her.

(SIGHS)

26:18.035 --> 26:20.526
What are you doing?
We have to find Hook.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.651
I can't help you.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.120
(SIGHS) We can't have you quitting.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.655
I'm not quitting. I'm being practical.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.323
Since when are you practical?

26:26.460 --> 26:29.998
This is all my fault.
I thought I was doing the right thing.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.628
Hercules was destined to kill Cerberus.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.005
I thought it would
help us get to Hook, but now...

26:34.134 --> 26:36.170
Now is not the time to give up.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.130
Need I remind you,

26:38.180 --> 26:42.344
l dedicated years to knocking you down,
but nothing could stop you.

26:42.476 --> 26:45.468
You took my kingdom, cast your curse.

26:45.521 --> 26:48.388
I lost my daughter for 28 years.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.355
And then you found her.

26:51.735 --> 26:54.351
You defeated me in a way
no one thought was possible.

26:56.573 --> 27:01.033
You made me your friend
by never giving up on me.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.861
So, what's the difference this time?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.909
And how am I supposed to help anyone
stand up to Hades,

27:07.042 --> 27:11.331
when all l have is
speeches about hope?

27:12.881 --> 27:14.382
You're right.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.675
Mary Margaret can't help.
In fact, we don't need her anymore.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.337
We need Snow White.

(YOUNG SNOW WHITE SNIFFLES)

27:28.272 --> 27:29.512
What are you doing?

27:36.738 --> 27:38.069
I'm done, Herc.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.691
I tried to be a leader,
but I am not cut out to be one.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.911
Regina will make a better queen
than I could ever hope to be.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.573
So, you're just going to
abandon your kingdom?

27:49.710 --> 27:52.452
I don't want to be Snow White anymore.

27:53.755 --> 27:54.790
That's a shame.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.788
Because I was really starting to like her.

27:56.925 --> 28:01.589
l was crazy to think that
I could stand up to those bandits.

28:01.722 --> 28:05.761
No one wins every battle, Snow.
Especially their first.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.094
You did.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.390
Can you keep a secret?

28:19.114 --> 28:21.400
My first Labor nearly killed me.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.658
It's the truth. The Nemean lion.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.453
Do you know why no one could kill it?

28:29.625 --> 28:32.082
Because its fur was impenetrable.
Like steel.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.460
With every blow I struck,
all I did was blunt my sword.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.329
So how did you defeat it?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.631
(SIGHS) When I had exhausted myself

28:39.676 --> 28:41.792
and I thought that
the beast was going to kill me,

28:41.845 --> 28:43.631
I accidentally dropped my torch.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.971
I set the brush surrounding us on fire.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.642
The flames singed the lion's fur
from his body.

28:50.687 --> 28:52.803
He wasn't invincible anymore.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.812
And | slayed him.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.311
Don't you see?

28:57.444 --> 28:58.809
If I hadn't failed,

28:58.862 --> 29:01.695
I never would have figured out
how to succeed.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.152
Okay.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.740
(SIGHS)

29:13.710 --> 29:16.668
So, how do I stop these bandits?

29:20.676 --> 29:21.665
Pick it up.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.552
It's pointless, Snow.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.639
I can't defeat Cerberus.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.471
We're just going to
antagonize my uncle.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.385
Well, that's a chance
we're going to have to take.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.520
Herc, how did Cerberus kill you?

29:39.403 --> 29:40.518
Why does it matter?

29:40.570 --> 29:44.062
Because... Because that is the only way
we're gonna figure out

29:44.199 --> 29:46.941

29:47.661 --> 29:49.197
He has three heads, Snow.

29:53.542 --> 29:57.251
no matter how valiantly I fought,
the other two would attack.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.997
I never should have
fought that beast alone.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.674
Well, that's it.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.045
That's why you're going to win this time.

You're not going to fight him alone.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.718
You wanna face Cerberus with me?

30:14.855 --> 30:18.564
Herc, I became that hero
you always believed I could be.

30:20.193 --> 30:21.854
And we are going to fight
that three-headed beast,

30:21.903 --> 30:24.030
and we are going to win.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.946

30:31.580 --> 30:32.695
What is it?

30:32.748 --> 30:35.410
Did Mary Margaret talk Muscles
