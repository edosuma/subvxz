the Linderman group recently
invested in your campaign.

I don't know why
you'd be surprised.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.897
Mr. Linderman
was a good friend
of my father's.

Mr. Linderman gets.

How long was he
hiding Claire?

This is goodbye.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.628
You don't have to do this.

There can't be any doubt
cast on your father.

No.

I thought
she was you.

01:37.807 --> 01:41.595
It was supposed
to be you.
Can't you do something?

01:42.478 --> 01:43.843
She's dead.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.062
Can't be.

don't remember anything?

03:14.320 --> 03:15.605
I told you. I'm trying.

is driving home from
the hospital with my wife,

of your memory with him.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.070
He did the same thing
to your wife and son.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.155
They remember even less.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.914
When can I go after them?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.492
Sorry, can't let
that be your errand.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.667
She's my daughter.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.792
She's an assignment,
or have you forgotten?

04:18.384 --> 04:19.920
We gave her to you,

04:20.010 --> 04:23.594
took her out of a bassinet,
put her in your hands
and told you to take her home,

04:23.681 --> 04:27.469

"No, thank you."

ends now.

five bucks.

anything all day.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.360
It's not like you'll tell me
where we're going anyway.

where we're going,
I will tell you.

campaign contributions

07:09.054 --> 07:11.170
you may have received
from the Linderman Group.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.393
The FBI is curious

07:18.856 --> 07:21.723
why the Las Vegas-based
Linderman Group
would be so interested

07:21.817 --> 07:23.557

a New York candidate.

there'd be no face-to-face.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.784

to deliver Linderman.

you in here, remember?

a little discretion

a meeting with you
at his casino tonight.

after I win.

the same thing,

07:59.104 --> 08:00.719

to record it.

incriminating evidence
to put him behind bars.

and so do you.

Did my DNA help?

13:34.398 --> 13:35.558
(SIGHING)

13:36.108 --> 13:37.143
No.

13:37.693 --> 13:39.558
Okay, well,
Mohinder, you've been
driving all night.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.688
Why don't you
just take a break?

13:40.779 --> 13:42.360
I can't.
These people
are in danger.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.438
We have to warn them.
If Sylar gets
to them first...

13:44.533 --> 13:46.615
Exactly, so let me help.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.409
I mean, here.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.536
Now, this one is in New York.

13:52.624 --> 13:56.583
I'll... Isaac Mendez.
I'll call him,
and you just relax,

13:56.670 --> 13:58.410
just take a minute.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.040
You're very kind,
Zane. Thank you.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.342
(KETTLE WHISTLING)

14:05.429 --> 14:09.638
You have no idea
how alone I used to feel,
how insignificant.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.095
You've given me hope.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.349
Hope is great.
We need caffeine.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.978
So, this formula,
if you figure it out,
how many of us will you find?

14:21.069 --> 14:24.436
Who knows?
Hundreds? Thousands?
Maybe more.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.530
No. It's busy.
I'll get him later.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.866
To new friends.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.043
This is good.
What is it?

14:40.130 --> 14:43.714
Chai. It's a special blend
my father brought from India.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.053
(CLEARING THROAT)

14:47.846 --> 14:49.962
Who are we gonna call next?

14:50.974 --> 14:52.180
No one.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.385
I already have you,
Mr. Sylar.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.335
Hiro?

15:24.841 --> 15:26.377
Mr. Petrelli?
Yeah.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.833
Flying...

15:27.928 --> 15:28.963
(SHUSHING)

15:29.346 --> 15:30.335
Not here.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.670
Sorry.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.431
Flying man.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.730
Yeah. Let me guess.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.103
You're still trying
to steal that sword
from Mr. Linderman?

15:44.194 --> 15:45.354
Where's your friend?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.525
Ando?

15:47.781 --> 15:49.692
I sent him back to Japan.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.240
This mission getting
too dangerous for him.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.158
I think I know
what you mean.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.908
You can't protect
everyone, right?

15:57.165 --> 15:59.076
Sometimes it's better
to go it alone.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.577
The more people
you try and help...

16:00.669 --> 16:02.125
The more people get hurt.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.292
Yeah.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.371
Please, you must help me.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.920
I can't get past
casino-security giant.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.589
When I first met you,
I thought you were nuts.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.011
It's okay.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.763
I thought you were mean,

16:16.059 --> 16:17.174
but now I know.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.806
You pretend
you do not care
aboutanyone,

16:19.896 --> 16:21.602
but you care too much.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.981
It's really important
to you to get
your powers back, huh?

16:28.071 --> 16:30.403
It is important
for everyone.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.656
Follow me.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.488
You know who I am?

16:36.580 --> 16:37.820
Of course,
Mr. Petrelli.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.496
My friend here
is making a delivery
from me to Mr. Linderman,

16:40.584 --> 16:42.324
something he's expecting.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.201
Oh, I didn't realize...

16:44.296 --> 16:46.332
You look like
you've been around long enough
to know what happens

16:46.423 --> 16:49.085
when Mr. Linderman
doesn't get something
he's expecting,

16:49.926 --> 16:51.917
or do I have
to paint you a picture?

16:52.721 --> 16:54.882
He can take it
to the curator.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.634
That work for you?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.723
Vivian Lewis?

16:59.561 --> 17:02.394
My name is Vivian,
and I'm from Canada?

17:02.731 --> 17:04.312
Are you kidding me?

17:04.399 --> 17:07.061
I do not need you happy,
only safe.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.851
There's nothing left of me.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.482
Everything I am
is gonna disappear

17:11.573 --> 17:12.938
the second
I get on that plane.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.945
My friends, my family, me.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.366
I can make you
forget it all

17:17.454 --> 17:19.194
if that's what
you would prefer.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.531
There's nothing
left for you here,
no one to trust.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.213
No, you cannot
see him again.

17:27.297 --> 17:31.415
Peter Petrelli is
the only person I know
I can trust, more than you.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.713
He cares about me.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.302
Why can't I hide
in New York with him?

17:36.389 --> 17:40.132
He's not in a position
to be responsible,
for you or himself.

17:40.644 --> 17:41.724
Come.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.311
Boarding pass and ID?

17:48.610 --> 17:50.316
Boarding pass, ID?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.571
Boarding pass and ID?

17:58.203 --> 18:01.787
Sorry, sir,
only ticketed passengers
are allowed beyond this point.

DETECTIVE TRACY:
Isaac Mendez. NYPD. We have
a few questions for you.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.852
Mr. Mendez?
Detective Jeff Tracy, NYPD.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.358
You know this woman,
Simone Deveaux?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.687
She and I,
we broke up recently.

18:36.074 --> 18:39.692
We received
an anonymous phone call
that she might be hurt.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.904
Some of your neighbors said
they heard an argument,
then gunshots.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.869
You mind ifwe take
a look around?

18:48.211 --> 18:51.703
Isaac, what's going on?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.792
Something wrong?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.721
No, ma'am,
apparently not.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.891
Sorry for taking your time.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.183
Simone, you're alive.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.565
Lucky you.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.733
My, you're very useful.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.494
Candice is special,
just like you.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.835
And Simone's...
She's traveling Europe
indefinitely

19:33.256 --> 19:35.918
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.295
There's a crew coming
to clean up this mess.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.843
How am I supposed to pretend
this didn't happen?

19:40.930 --> 19:45.048
Maybe you should have thought
about that before
you shot her, twice.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.931
What's the matter, sweetie?

19:49.022 --> 19:51.138
You want to shoot me again?

19:54.110 --> 19:55.316
Enough.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.198
(SIGHING)

19:59.908 --> 20:03.071
I can't stay here.
Take me with you.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.867
That's not our assignment.

20:04.954 --> 20:08.617
Please, I don't know
what to do.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.459
Of course you do.
You keep painting.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.252
My condolences.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.605
JESSICA: Here we go.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.769
When did you get so good?

20:38.863 --> 20:40.239
I'm unemployed.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.939
What do you think
I do all day
when you're at school?

20:43.743 --> 20:44.949
Wow.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.613
One more?

20:46.704 --> 20:48.615
I can't.
I'm gonna be late
for the bus.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.741
So be late.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.666
You're not gonna learn
anything at school
that you don't already know.

Love you.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.711
(SIGHING)

to admit it, Niki.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.676

21:11.438 --> 21:13.850
Did you think
Iwouldn't find out?

21:14.524 --> 21:15.889
About what?

21:19.404 --> 21:20.894
Where'd you get that?

21:20.989 --> 21:22.729
It was on my pillow.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.863
Well, I didn't put it there.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.536
Were you digging
through my stuff?

21:30.623 --> 21:34.207
Don't turn this
around on me, Niki.
You said no more secrets.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.784
Now I find out
you're going
to Linderman's casino.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.370
For what?
What they got you
doing with this guy?

21:38.465 --> 21:39.921
It's nothing.
Linderman called,

21:40.008 --> 21:42.465
and he asked me
to be a dealer.
That's it.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.713
You know you're not
talking aboutjust
dealing cards, here.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.171
That's all this is.
Don't you trust me?

21:48.266 --> 21:53.977
I promise you,
I won't do anything that
I don't want to, all right?

22:11.247 --> 22:13.704
You left that for him,
didn't you?

22:16.085 --> 22:17.291
Cute.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.171
I can't feel my fingers.

22:26.262 --> 22:30.426
It's the curare. It induces
paralysis of the brain,

22:30.767 --> 22:33.930
which means
you can't control
your abilities.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.682
Whoever you think I am,
I'm not.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.606
You are the man
who murdered my father,

22:39.692 --> 22:42.559
or do you still expect me
to believe you're Zane Taylor?

22:45.448 --> 22:49.236
Zane was killed
three days ago,
the same day I met you,

22:51.621 --> 22:55.239
and you thought
you were so clever
giving me his DNA.

22:56.251 --> 23:00.210
You're a parasite.
You killed my father
and fed off his work.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.874
(SCREAMING)

23:02.966 --> 23:05.753
Let me hear you say it.
Tell me your name!

23:05.843 --> 23:08.550
Say it! Iwant
to hear you say it!

23:15.186 --> 23:17.928
There's only one thing
to do with a parasite,

23:18.022 --> 23:20.479
kill it before
it kills again.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.900
You're just like your father.
Murderers, the both of you.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.569
I'm a scientist.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.232
Your father said that,
but he kept leading me...

23:30.326 --> 23:31.907
He had no idea
what you were.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.110
He knew.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.444
He might not have admitted it,

23:34.539 --> 23:37.281
but, after all, we were making
so much progress together.
Why would he stop?

23:37.375 --> 23:39.536
You know nothing
about my father!

23:40.795 --> 23:44.879
I know everything.
He confided in me.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.502
He told me things he felt
he could never tell you,

23:47.594 --> 23:50.006
things about
your sister, Shanti.

23:50.972 --> 23:56.638
He thought you were too...
What's the word?
Fragile to know the truth.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.598
That's why he liked me.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.769
You were always
seeking his approval,
while I provided stimulation.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.192
He gave up on you,
but he adored me.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.770
Now, who's
the real parasite, here?

24:17.206 --> 24:22.200
You're right.
My father did want answers.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.545
He called you Patient Zero.

24:26.466 --> 24:29.674
You're the template he used
to create this formula.

24:29.761 --> 24:32.548
You're the key
to unlocking its secret.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.970
As much as I'd like to,

24:35.058 --> 24:37.515
killing you will not
give me what I need.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.931
So what are you gonna do?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.516
I'm going to take a sample
of your spinal fluid,

24:45.193 --> 24:47.058
and it's going to hurt.

24:49.197 --> 24:52.064
Might actually do
some good before you die.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.991
(SCREAMING)

25:27.777 --> 25:30.519
There are so few
Dead Sea fragments
left in the world.

Be a pity
if you crushed this one.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.527
So many things.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.026
You've brought
the new Mendez.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.279
This one is very special.

25:47.380 --> 25:52.295
This painting is ripped
and repaired with scotch tape.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.842
Yes, very special.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.346
Is there something else?

26:00.101 --> 26:03.514
I need receipt for delivery.

go straight to my room.

I guess it's hard to act
natural when you're going
after the whale.

Mr. Linderman

Don't run surveillance
on a man from inside
his own hotel.

It's really tacky.

28:14.277 --> 28:16.017
Kick over your guns.

It's so much easier

they answer everything.

Don't I deserve
to be saved?

28:49.687 --> 28:54.522
Aren't | just
a victim, too?
I didn't ask for this.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.484
And what
would you have me do?

28:58.863 --> 29:00.478
Help find a way.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.523
Give me salvation.

29:07.330 --> 29:10.868
Give me your damn list
so I can sink my teeth in!

29:18.633 --> 29:21.466
I'm the natural progression
of the species.

29:22.678 --> 29:26.842
Evolution is a part
of nature, and nature kills.
Simple, right?

29:26.933 --> 29:29.424
What you've done
is not evolution.
It's murder.

29:29.518 --> 29:32.555
What I am doing
is revenge.

29:33.481 --> 29:36.063
Now, I can fulfill
my duty as a son.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.170
I wasn't begging
for my life.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.049
I was offering you yours.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.009
You are your father's son.

30:10.643 --> 30:14.636
So determined,
you didn't even notice
I stopped the IV.

30:19.026 --> 30:24.646
Don't worry. You might
actually do some good
before you die,

30:27.284 --> 30:29.275
starting with that list.

31:26.844 --> 31:30.382
I'm back in my room.
I'll be on the floor
in an hour.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.851
Wearing this could get
a person killed.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.152
Okay, it's all right. Easy.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.197
Listen to me. I don't know
how much time we have
before she comes back.

31:50.326 --> 31:53.568
Who?
Jessica, the woman
that they sent after you.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.287
You picked the wrong day
to screw with me.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.581
Linderman knows
about the wire and the FBI.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.499
Then you know
the FBI can hear
everything we're saying.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.373
No, they can't.
They're dead.

32:06.342 --> 32:09.004
Linderman knows
that you turned on him.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.087
Did you come here
to kill me or warn me?

32:14.141 --> 32:15.677
Just trust me.

32:19.855 --> 32:22.562
Well, you're back early.
Hey, good news.

32:22.650 --> 32:26.359
I convinced the hotel
to let us keep Mr. Muggles
in the room.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.356
That is good news.

32:33.077 --> 32:36.069
I've been going
out of my head, thinking
everybody's watching me,

32:36.163 --> 32:38.074
waiting for me
to make a mistake.
Did you find her?

32:38.165 --> 32:39.496
No, I can't do that.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.287
If I know where she is,
they can extract it from me.

32:42.378 --> 32:44.369
I need you to be strong
a little while longer.

32:44.463 --> 32:48.206
We both have to pretend
that we have no idea
what happened

32:48.300 --> 32:49.335
so Claire will be safe.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.461
But the company...

32:50.553 --> 32:52.794
Has to be stopped
for good.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.881
That's the only way
to make sure
that Claire will stay safe.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.896
I didn't know
that I could talk
to you like this.

33:06.318 --> 33:10.982
I always just thought
that you'd be so furious at me
for all the lies and deceit.

33:11.073 --> 33:14.031
Right now, we just have
to take care of Claire.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.154
We'll talk about us later.

Yes, he is going

I'm looking
for Peter Petrelli.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.540
You picked a terrible time
to do that.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.667
Peter's not here just now.

come inside, Claire.

to protect you, but you
haven't made that very easy.

36:09.835 --> 36:13.544
Quite stubborn, aren't you?
Just like your father.

36:19.553 --> 36:22.670
Linderman hired her
to kill the FBI
and keep you in line.

36:22.765 --> 36:23.845
Who?

36:25.434 --> 36:27.425
Let's just say I owe her.

Then run.
Get your family and run.

You said that
you had kids.
Two boys?

36:40.491 --> 36:41.981
I can't do that.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.285
You don't have
any other option.

36:46.497 --> 36:49.409
Yeah, I do.
I could kill him.

36:52.586 --> 36:53.996
Then knock me out.

Mr. Linderman?

37:48.434 --> 37:49.549
Right.

37:50.561 --> 37:53.394
Do you enjoy vegetables,
Mr. Petrelli?

37:57.818 --> 37:59.979
I've been known
to eat zucchini
when the mood strikes,

38:00.070 --> 38:01.776
but not as a rule.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.780
You know, you can
probably hire someone
to do that for you.

38:04.867 --> 38:08.325
Oh, yeah,
I like to cook.
It's my meditation.

38:08.412 --> 38:11.119
One aims for perfection
in one's life,

38:11.206 --> 38:13.492
but one doesn't
find it very often.

38:13.876 --> 38:17.664
For me, this is about
as close as it gets.

Voila! A pot pie,
wholesome, warm, healthy.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.377
That's, of course,
if you can live
without the cream sauce.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.384
Personally, I can't.
I mean, what's the point?

38:31.226 --> 38:34.343
You know, people can sleep,
or they can gamble,

38:34.813 --> 38:38.021
or they can even make love
when they're miserable,

38:39.067 --> 38:43.231
but I think that most people
eat when they're happy.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.445
I like to see people happy.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.814
Are you happy, Nathan?

38:49.077 --> 38:50.578
Not especially.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.908
I guess I have a few issues
that plague me.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.411
Oh, dear,
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:57.461 --> 39:00.498
You see, I think
there comes a time
when a man has to ask himself

39:00.589 --> 39:04.332
whether he wants a life
of happiness
or a life of meaning.

39:05.594 --> 39:06.674

(LINDERMAN CHUCKLING)

39:08.305 --> 39:11.593
Can't be done.
Two very different paths.

39:12.434 --> 39:17.679
I mean, to be truly happy,
a man must live
absolutely in the present.

39:17.898 --> 39:20.890
I mean, with no thought
of what's gone before

39:20.984 --> 39:22.724
and no thought
of what lies ahead.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.946
But for a life of meaning,

39:25.656 --> 39:30.116
a man is condemned
to wallow in the past
and obsess about the future.

39:30.953 --> 39:35.242
My guess is that
you've done quite a bit
of obsessing

39:35.332 --> 39:37.618
about yours
these last few days.

39:47.427 --> 39:50.260
Now, you can't have
any of my pot pie.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.345

39:59.439 --> 40:02.055

have tried to kill me.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.520
Of course, you can pull
that trigger, Nathan.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.776
You'd be taking
both of our lives.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.153
You'll be dead within moments.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.620

you something.

in anything
you have to offer me.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.872
