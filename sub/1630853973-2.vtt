of wrestling display on,

09:27.052 --> 09:28.619
and they need a judge.

09:28.663 --> 09:30.142
RUTHERFORD:
Oh, yeah, baby! Let's go!

09:30.186 --> 09:31.796
Didyou decouple
the flow inverters?

09:31.840 --> 09:34.364
Of course I did.
Just focus on your own work.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.800
You know, it's not a big deal

09:35.844 --> 09:37.541
to admit
that we should be down there

09:37.585 --> 09:39.021
and they should be up here.

09:39.064 --> 09:40.762
Starfleet
isn't all about being fed fruit

09:40.805 --> 09:43.199
by erotic aliens with
slightly different nose ridges.

09:43.242 --> 09:45.331
Sometimes
you got to get your hands dirty.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.117
Engineers would've been done
with this hours ago.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.771
Arguing
with your commanding officer

09:49.814 --> 09:52.338
isn't gonna get the job done
any sooner.

09:52.382 --> 09:54.166
Aah! Oh, no. Oh, no,

09:54.210 --> 09:56.038
-no, no, no, no.
-[Mariner grumbles]

10:01.043 --> 10:03.436
[indistinct chatter]

10:03.480 --> 10:05.395
-[door whooshes open]
-Oh, hey.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.092
Hey.
What's with all the new faces?

10:07.136 --> 10:08.659
We're hosting
everyone that got stranded

10:08.703 --> 10:10.400
on the orbital lift
while it gets repaired.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.794
That's cool. Listen,
you were totally right earlier.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.534
I've been saying yes
to everything today,

10:14.578 --> 10:16.101
going way outside
my comfort zone,

10:16.145 --> 10:18.016
and so far,
Shaxs says he owes me a favor,

10:18.060 --> 10:19.801
I'm not afraid
of Chief Lundy anymore...

10:19.844 --> 10:22.455
[exhales] It's just been
a really great day.

10:22.499 --> 10:24.153
Oh, I love that for you, Boims.

10:24.196 --> 10:25.763
See?
When you get rid of the plan,

10:25.807 --> 10:27.330
you leave room for good things.

10:27.373 --> 10:30.681
From now on, the new plan
is say yes to everything.

10:30.725 --> 10:32.117
But that's, uh, still a plan.

10:32.161 --> 10:33.684
How about just no plan?

10:33.728 --> 10:35.817
Nope. Today, I am a new Boimler.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.645
A bold Boimler.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.734
And the next person
who asks me to do something,

10:39.777 --> 10:42.040
I'm saying yes no matter what.

10:42.084 --> 10:44.042
-K'RANCH: Excuse me.
-[screams]

10:44.086 --> 10:45.740
I am K'Ranch.

10:45.783 --> 10:48.699
I was supposed to be
on the planet by now,

10:48.743 --> 10:50.875
but the space elevator
is broken.

10:50.919 --> 10:52.964
Hi, K'Ranch.
Welcome to the Cerritos.

10:53.008 --> 10:55.793
I'm Tendi, and this is Boimler.

10:55.837 --> 10:59.928
K'RANCH: My species has an
undeniable natural urge to hunt.

10:59.971 --> 11:03.845
This delay to the planet
has been weighing on me.

11:03.888 --> 11:06.761
Would either of you
be willing to...

11:06.804 --> 11:08.676
[moans, gasps]

11:08.719 --> 11:11.200
...be willing to be hunted?

11:11.243 --> 11:13.593
Oh, no, thank you.
Maybe you should see

11:13.637 --> 11:15.247
if Dr. T'Ana can help you out
in sickbay.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.814
Wait. Uh, Mr. K'Ranch,

11:16.858 --> 11:18.642
I'm gonna say yes to the hunted.

11:18.686 --> 11:20.644
-To-to being hunted.
-Uh...

11:20.688 --> 11:22.777
Uh, just because you said
you were going to say yes

11:22.820 --> 11:24.430
to the next person
who asked you to do something

11:24.474 --> 11:25.780
doesn't mean
you have to do this.

11:25.823 --> 11:27.346
You can do the next one.

11:27.390 --> 11:28.783
Eh, you're right...

11:28.826 --> 11:30.828
is what the old Boimler
would have said.

11:30.872 --> 11:32.830
It would be an honor
if you hunted me, sir.

11:32.874 --> 11:34.484
Let's do it.

11:36.486 --> 11:39.532
[roars]

11:39.576 --> 11:40.838
[snarls]

11:40.882 --> 11:45.495
You are now my prey.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.325
The hunt begins in one hour.

11:49.368 --> 11:50.761
[Boimler groans]

11:50.805 --> 11:53.982
[K'Ranch gasps, growls]

11:54.025 --> 11:55.766
It won't be as bad as it sounds.

11:55.810 --> 11:57.594
What are you doing?!
You only have an hour!

11:57.637 --> 12:00.466
-Run! Run! Run!
-[gasps, screams]

12:06.821 --> 12:08.518
At this point,
everything should be lining up.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.129
All you need to do is align
the magnetic seal on the panel,

12:11.173 --> 12:13.175
and the repair is complete.

12:13.218 --> 12:14.567
Magnetic seal? I don't even...

12:14.611 --> 12:15.743
What the hell
is she talking about?

12:17.701 --> 12:19.442
Billups,
these space elevators use

12:19.485 --> 12:20.660
Federation standard
measurements, right?

12:20.704 --> 12:22.662
Uh, we've run into a little bit

12:22.706 --> 12:24.229
of a diplomacy problem
down here.

12:24.273 --> 12:25.883
[gasps]
You dare enter the sacred hall

12:25.927 --> 12:27.406
without an exposed navel?!

12:27.450 --> 12:29.800
Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't know.

12:29.844 --> 12:31.628
What's going on down there?
It sounds a little tense.

12:31.671 --> 12:33.891
Uh, well, I don't know how well
you know Dulainian religion,

12:33.935 --> 12:35.937
but we weren't wearing the right
outfits in the right place,

12:35.980 --> 12:37.852
and now the locals are getting
pretty testy, so maybe,

12:37.895 --> 12:39.810
sir, you could, uh, come down
here and help smooth things out.

12:39.854 --> 12:41.246
-That would be great.
-Ha!

12:41.290 --> 12:42.639
I knew it. All right, let's go.

12:42.682 --> 12:43.988
No can do, Billups.

12:44.032 --> 12:45.120
What?

12:45.163 --> 12:46.730
We still have work to do
up here.

12:46.774 --> 12:48.601
Show them your belly buttons.
You'll be fine.

12:48.645 --> 12:50.560
We tried that,
and it just made them angrier.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.997
No, look. Our B-buttons
are out and about.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.825
Just explain
that we respect all cultures

12:54.869 --> 12:56.696
and, you know, morality

12:56.740 --> 12:58.698
and the Prime Directive
and all that stuff.

12:58.742 --> 13:01.353
Okay, I'll try it.

13:01.397 --> 13:04.182
Jack... Uh, sir, okay,
you've made your point.

13:04.226 --> 13:06.924
Can we please just go down there
and lend a diplomatic hand?

13:06.968 --> 13:09.013
Billups can rebuild the
navigation computer blindfolded.

13:09.057 --> 13:11.059
I think he can handle
some angry locals.

13:11.102 --> 13:12.930
He clearly can't!
Is it really worth

13:12.974 --> 13:15.150
endangering those guys
just to get under my skin?

13:15.193 --> 13:16.499
My command decisions

13:16.542 --> 13:18.457
have nothing to do
with your sensitivities.

13:18.501 --> 13:20.938
You need to learn how to trust
your superiors, Ensign.

13:20.982 --> 13:23.201
Fine.
I'm gonna go work over there

13:23.245 --> 13:24.724
so I don't have to watch you
fumble around

13:24.768 --> 13:26.291
-with that stupid pipe.
-I'm not fumbling!

13:26.335 --> 13:27.815
[grunts]

13:29.773 --> 13:31.862
[inhales deeply]

13:31.906 --> 13:34.299
[snarls]

13:34.343 --> 13:37.172
Uh, hello? Mr. K'Ranch, sir?

13:37.215 --> 13:39.870
What do you want, prey?

13:39.914 --> 13:41.350
I was just wondering,
when you say

13:41.393 --> 13:43.178
you're gonna hunt me,
you mean, like,

13:43.221 --> 13:45.528
-metaphorically, right?
-[inhales]

13:45.571 --> 13:47.225
[snarls]

13:47.269 --> 13:49.706
K'RANCH: There are only
three types of prey.

13:49.749 --> 13:51.447
You are the first type:

13:51.490 --> 13:53.884
immobilized by your fear.

13:53.928 --> 13:56.887
The second type
scurries away to hide,

13:56.931 --> 13:59.847
delaying the inevitable.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.283
Uh, what's the third kind?

14:01.326 --> 14:03.502
The third
is a winged lizard-type creature

14:03.546 --> 14:05.113
that doesn't really apply
to you.

14:05.156 --> 14:07.115
Oh, okay. Yeah. No,
I'm just gonna scurry away

14:07.158 --> 14:09.639
while I think about it.
When does the hunt start?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.076
It already has!

14:12.120 --> 14:14.513
-[grunts]
-[Boimler screams]

14:14.557 --> 14:16.037

14:34.403 --> 14:36.753
Oh, no!
[grunts]

14:38.233 --> 14:40.104
No, no, no!
[screaming]

14:47.982 --> 14:49.548
[gasps]
Someone's trying to kill me!

14:49.592 --> 14:51.811
-[inhales deeply]
-[K'Ranch snarls]

14:55.163 --> 14:56.468

14:56.512 --> 14:57.774
[whimpers]

14:57.817 --> 14:59.689
[panting, grunts]

14:59.732 --> 15:01.691
Captain, you got to help me.
I'm being hunted.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.562
What? Not on my ship.

15:03.606 --> 15:05.086
That's totally unacceptable.

15:05.129 --> 15:07.653
Security,
I need a team on Deck Three.

15:07.697 --> 15:10.265
Oh, thank God. It's this big guy
called K'Ranch.

15:10.308 --> 15:11.831
I told him he could hunt me
in the bar,

15:11.875 --> 15:13.442
-but that was a mistake, and...
-K'Ranch?

15:13.485 --> 15:15.052
[chuckles]
Well, that's different.

15:15.096 --> 15:17.446
-Security, belay that order.
-What?!

15:17.489 --> 15:20.623
I shared a lovely brunch
earlier today with K'Ranch.

15:20.666 --> 15:22.842
[chuckles]: You know,
he's quite the charmer.

15:22.886 --> 15:25.410
I'm glad he found someone
to partake in his Venarix hunt.

15:25.454 --> 15:27.412
But I don't want to be hit
with an arrow or a boomerang

15:27.456 --> 15:28.979
or any of that. Please, Captain.

15:29.023 --> 15:31.242
Ensign,
we have to respect his culture.

15:31.286 --> 15:33.070
And didn't you give him
your word?

15:33.114 --> 15:34.942
-I want my word back.
-[K'Ranch snarling]

15:34.985 --> 15:37.553
-Oh, he's good. You better run.
-[Boimler screams]

15:37.596 --> 15:40.817
-Thanks again for the mimosas.
-My pleasure.

15:40.860 --> 15:42.688
-Happy hunting.
-[Boimler screams]

15:42.732 --> 15:44.473
-[Mariner groans]
-[PADD chimes]

15:44.516 --> 15:46.301
RUTHERFORD: Sir, we could
really use your help.

15:46.344 --> 15:48.477
The Dulainians saw that
Lieutenant Billups had an outie,

15:48.520 --> 15:50.174
and now he's being sacrificed
to Morgo,

15:50.218 --> 15:52.394
which I think
is a sentient volcano.

15:52.437 --> 15:54.004
Help!

15:54.048 --> 15:56.398
[groans] Just demand to parley
with their leader

15:56.441 --> 15:59.183
and explain they cannot
sacrifice Mr. Billups. Okay?

15:59.227 --> 16:01.490
Straight spine.
Speak from the diaphragm.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.318
Right. Okay. Also, their leader

16:03.361 --> 16:05.276
is either an ancient god
or a telepathic baby.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.799
They're kind of dancing
around it.

16:06.843 --> 16:09.454
Sounds like you're
narrowing it down. You got this.

16:09.498 --> 16:10.803
RUTHERFORD:
Uh, right. Okay.

16:10.847 --> 16:12.153
I'll speak from the diaphragm.

16:12.196 --> 16:13.676
BILLUPS:
Help me!

16:13.719 --> 16:15.156
-I demand parley!
-BILLUPS: Help!

16:15.199 --> 16:16.679
-Hello? Someone?
-[Billups screams]

16:16.722 --> 16:18.855
[sighs]

16:18.898 --> 16:20.988
[grunts]
Oh!

16:21.031 --> 16:22.728
Ugh! I'm gonna do it.

16:22.772 --> 16:23.903
I'm just gonna do it.
I don't care.

16:23.947 --> 16:24.992
I don't care. All right.

16:25.993 --> 16:27.777
[sighs]

16:31.476 --> 16:32.869
I'm coming, Ruthy!

16:32.912 --> 16:34.044

16:39.484 --> 16:40.485
[Mariner whooping]

16:40.529 --> 16:42.835

16:42.879 --> 16:43.836
Yeah!

16:43.880 --> 16:45.316
[laughs]

16:47.318 --> 16:48.885
RANSOM:
Ransom to Mariner. Come in.

16:48.928 --> 16:50.278
Crap.
[clears throat]

16:50.321 --> 16:51.801
What's up, sir?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.325
Mariner, I was, uh...
What's that sound?

16:54.369 --> 16:56.066
-Is that wind?
-Uh, I, uh...

16:56.110 --> 16:59.504
I had to open up an exterior
pressure conduit. Oh!

16:59.548 --> 17:01.289
Ah, right.
The old pressure conduit.

17:01.332 --> 17:03.813
Well, I've been doing some
thinking, and you were right.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.815
I was going out of my way
to try to prove

17:05.858 --> 17:08.774
that you would disobey my orders
if you felt you knew better.

17:08.818 --> 17:11.908
But you stayed on task.
You didn't go rogue.

17:11.951 --> 17:13.779
Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah.

17:13.823 --> 17:16.391
Anyway, listen, those engineers
are in way over their heads.

17:16.434 --> 17:18.306
It's time for us
to go save their butts.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.308
I'll come meet you
in Section Eight.

17:20.351 --> 17:23.006
[grunting]

17:23.050 --> 17:24.442
-[panting]
-What? You okay?

17:24.486 --> 17:26.966
I-I-I was just saying, "Yah!

17:27.010 --> 17:29.056
Sounds good," sir.

17:29.099 --> 17:30.622
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep]

Where are you, prey?

17:54.255 --> 17:58.085
...am a proud soldier
of the Klingon Empire!

17:58.128 --> 17:59.129
-[snarls loudly]
-Shut it.

17:59.173 --> 18:01.088
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

18:01.131 --> 18:02.915
Stupid Ferengi program.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.353
Warrior,
fight to the last breath.

18:05.396 --> 18:07.572
Easy for you to say.
I'm not a Klingon.

18:07.616 --> 18:11.054
I-I-I tried to be bold today,
but I just ended up as prey.

18:11.098 --> 18:13.143
The only way you can lose now
is by letting

18:13.187 --> 18:15.232
your foe define who you are.

18:15.276 --> 18:17.930
Never back down! Never cower!

18:26.983 --> 18:29.855
The hunt is on.

18:29.899 --> 18:32.075
-[door whooshes open]
-K'Ranch!

18:32.119 --> 18:33.076
[snarls]

18:33.120 --> 18:34.382
I am not your prey.

18:34.425 --> 18:36.862
I am Bold Boimler!

18:36.906 --> 18:38.690
I haven't backed down all day,

18:38.734 --> 18:40.562
and I'm not starting now.

18:40.605 --> 18:43.869
You better run,
because now the hunted

18:43.913 --> 18:45.219
has become...
[grunts]

18:45.262 --> 18:46.698
Oh, my God!

18:46.742 --> 18:48.570
-No, no, no! [crying]
-[K'Ranch snarls]

18:48.613 --> 18:52.878
The hunted always tries
to become the hunter.

18:52.922 --> 18:55.272
Tale old as time.

18:55.316 --> 18:57.753
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
I didn't say you could kill me.

18:57.796 --> 19:00.016
Stop! Please!

19:00.059 --> 19:02.323
-[snarls]
-[camera clicks]

19:02.366 --> 19:04.281
And with that,
my hunt has ended.

19:04.325 --> 19:06.196
Y-You're not gonna kill me?

19:06.240 --> 19:08.720
Kromsapiods
practice catch and release.

19:08.764 --> 19:10.940
We respect life above all else.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.246
That's why we hunt.

19:12.289 --> 19:13.464
Oh, thank God.

19:13.508 --> 19:15.031
You were excellent prey,

19:15.074 --> 19:16.511
but I do have notes.

19:16.554 --> 19:18.861
Can you maybe give them to me
in sickbay?

19:18.904 --> 19:21.255
When you decide to switch it up
and become the hunter,

19:21.298 --> 19:23.561
you can't just announce it
and stand there.

19:23.605 --> 19:25.128
Stick and move, you know?

19:25.172 --> 19:26.956
Uh-huh, yeah.
I'll keep that in mind.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.654
You have earned my respect,
Bradward Boimler.

19:29.698 --> 19:32.875
I will be passing along
high praise to your captain.

19:32.918 --> 19:35.878
Really? Thank you.
[grunts]

19:35.921 --> 19:40.187
Maybe just one more
for the boys back home.

19:40.230 --> 19:42.232
[grunting, panting]

19:45.192 --> 19:47.237
Climbing wall? For real?

19:47.281 --> 19:48.760
This stupid society

19:48.804 --> 19:52.155
built on exercise and wellness.

19:52.199 --> 19:54.288
Okay.
[groaning]

19:54.331 --> 19:56.638
[exhales]

19:57.682 --> 20:00.207
Whoa!
[groans]

20:00.250 --> 20:02.687
[panting]

20:06.561 --> 20:08.345
Sorry I'm late.
Had to make a quick trip

20:08.389 --> 20:10.260
-to the little commanders' room.
-No biggie.

20:10.304 --> 20:12.262
I've just been waiting here
the whole time.

20:12.306 --> 20:13.959
This is gonna sound crazy,
Mariner,

20:14.003 --> 20:15.396
but since we don't have
a shuttle

20:15.439 --> 20:17.136
and the elevator
still won't descend,

20:17.180 --> 20:19.400
we're gonna have
to skydive down.

20:19.443 --> 20:22.098
Oh, wow. That's a wild plan,
sir. It's wild.

20:22.141 --> 20:24.579
I know. But if we hurry,
we can make it in time.

20:24.622 --> 20:26.450
Maybe...
Maybe we take a quick break?

20:26.494 --> 20:28.147
[chuckles]
Good one.

20:28.191 --> 20:29.975
-Let's roll. [laughs]
-[groans]

20:30.019 --> 20:32.804
[whoops]
Yeah!

20:32.848 --> 20:34.676
-[shouting]
-[Mariner yawns]

20:34.719 --> 20:36.678
[Ransom laughs]

20:36.721 --> 20:39.376
[Mariner snores, grunts]

20:44.903 --> 20:48.429
TIMBER: We come to you,
Volcanic Lord Morgo!

20:48.472 --> 20:50.169
Navel of the Planet!

20:50.213 --> 20:52.998
We sacrifice these sinners
in the name

20:53.042 --> 20:55.305
of Mendrick,
our psychic baby leader,

20:55.349 --> 20:58.308
and his coleader, 355,

20:58.352 --> 21:00.702
the sentient computer!

21:00.745 --> 21:03.400
Ooh, they weren't lying.
This did get complicated.

21:03.444 --> 21:06.882
Wow. Psychic baby,
evil computer anda volcano?

21:06.925 --> 21:08.187
You guys ever heard of overkill?

21:08.231 --> 21:10.146
VOLCANO:
It provides a system

21:10.189 --> 21:13.018
of checks and balances.

21:13.062 --> 21:15.151
MENDRICK: How dare you question
our method of governance.

21:15.194 --> 21:16.544
Throw them in the volcano.

21:16.587 --> 21:18.067
[355 beeps]

21:21.940 --> 21:23.159
For what it's worth, sir,

21:23.202 --> 21:25.030
it was an honor
serving with you.

21:25.074 --> 21:27.555
Oh, Samanthan,
the honor is mine.

21:27.598 --> 21:29.296
RANSOM:
Wait!

21:29.339 --> 21:31.341
I demand parley!

21:31.385 --> 21:33.952
You live a health-based way
of life, correct?

21:33.996 --> 21:35.693
VOLCANO:
Yes.

21:35.737 --> 21:37.608
It is our highest calling.

21:37.652 --> 21:38.696
[355 beeps]

21:38.740 --> 21:41.003
-Then behold.
-[crowd gasping]

21:41.046 --> 21:42.700
[355 beeps]

21:42.744 --> 21:44.136
VOLCANO:
Wow.

21:44.180 --> 21:47.314
Your lava tubes are perfect.

21:47.357 --> 21:49.359
MENDRICK:
You are wise, Starfleet.

21:49.403 --> 21:50.447
We will hear you out.

21:50.491 --> 21:52.362
Although we all come

21:52.406 --> 21:56.018
from different worlds,
we are only slightly different.

21:59.238 --> 22:01.676
-[door chimes]
-Yo, yo.

22:01.719 --> 22:03.765
You, uh,
you wanted to see me, sir?

22:03.808 --> 22:05.506
I owe you an apology. I assumed

22:05.549 --> 22:07.856
you'd be looking
for ways to piss me off

22:07.899 --> 22:10.075
and flame out.
I was wrong to push it.

22:10.119 --> 22:13.557
Thanks. I-I really want to stay
on the Cerritos.

22:13.601 --> 22:16.560
I-It was good work today,
but this was just one day.

22:16.604 --> 22:18.301
Don't think it erased
all the insubordination

22:18.345 --> 22:19.998
I've gotten from you
in the past.

22:20.042 --> 22:22.000
Yep. Yes, sir. Message received.

22:23.045 --> 22:26.353
Sir, you were really impressive
down there,

22:26.396 --> 22:28.050
the way you navigated
that volcano

22:28.093 --> 22:29.443
and the baby and all that.

22:29.486 --> 22:30.618
Save it for your personal log,
Mariner.

22:30.661 --> 22:32.010
Buttering me up
is not gonna make

22:32.054 --> 22:33.490
your life any easier.

22:33.534 --> 22:34.752
[exhales]
All right.

22:34.796 --> 22:36.319
[door whooshes shut]

22:36.363 --> 22:39.235
Yeah, I was pretty impressive.

22:39.278 --> 22:41.629
So, Ransom's a dick,
and I hate him.

22:41.672 --> 22:43.370
Oh, sounds like today went well.

22:43.413 --> 22:45.415
I mean, he did keep me
from getting dumped into lava.

22:45.459 --> 22:47.939
No. He was the whole reason
you were dangling over the lava

22:47.983 --> 22:49.854
-to start with.
-Nah. That was on me.

22:49.898 --> 22:51.465
I really should have had
my belly button out.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.772
You eat breakfast
and gain plus-three stamina!

22:54.816 --> 22:56.383
Damn,
they really programmed Martok

22:56.426 --> 22:58.559
with, like, full intensity
at all times.

22:58.602 --> 23:01.300
Hey, there he is.
How's the shoulder?

23:01.344 --> 23:04.129
Dr. T'Ana says it'll probably
always feel a little off,

23:04.173 --> 23:05.696
-but it's fine.
-Uh, sorry.

23:05.740 --> 23:07.481
I kind of feel responsible
since I was the one

23:07.524 --> 23:08.917
who told you
to go against your plans.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.614
All those years
of trying too hard

23:10.658 --> 23:12.486
never got me half the
recognition that I got today.

23:12.529 --> 23:13.922
Plus nerve damage.

23:13.965 --> 23:15.837
Plans are officially
out the air lock.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.230
I'm Bold Boimler
from here on out.

23:18.274 --> 23:20.842
I'm not sure that was the lesson
to learn today, you know?

23:20.885 --> 23:22.670
Uh, how about moderation?

23:22.713 --> 23:24.236
Old Boimler was into moderation.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.108
Bold Boimler is into boldness.

23:26.151 --> 23:29.720
I confidently enter the bar
and demand bloodwine.

23:29.764 --> 23:33.071
The bartender rips your arm off
and kills you with it.

23:33.115 --> 23:34.595
It is not an honorable death

23:34.638 --> 23:37.511
since, technically,
you have died by your own hand.

23:37.554 --> 23:39.338
Ah, whatever.
I'm still gonna be bold.

23:39.382 --> 23:41.123
