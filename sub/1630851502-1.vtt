You were standing there,

08:11.156 --> 08:13.259
looking at the calendar

08:13.259 --> 08:15.279

08:13.259 --> 08:15.279
was about to happen,

08:15.279 --> 08:17.329

08:15.279 --> 08:17.329
"What's he doing?"

That's something

08:27.106 --> 08:28.942

The fact that I didn't propose

08:36.349 --> 08:39.753
the right way.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.745
- [yodeling]

14:05.745 --> 14:07.447
Oh, my God.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.381
- Aloha!

14:09.381 --> 14:11.350
- It's Paris Hilton

14:09.381 --> 14:11.350
and her twin!

14:11.350 --> 14:13.352
- I'm so glad you noticed.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.221
- It's always fun going

14:13.352 --> 14:15.221
on vacation with Dad.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.524
You don't ever know

14:15.221 --> 14:17.524
what's going to happen.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.929
We went on a ski trip one time

14:17.524 --> 14:20.929
when we were kids,

14:20.929 --> 14:23.229
and Dad--well, we left him

14:20.929 --> 14:23.229
alone, which was the problem.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.597
All of a sudden, we hear

14:23.229 --> 14:25.597
people talking about him,

14:25.597 --> 14:27.801
and he had ran into a tree.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.469
- Yeah.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.469
- On his skis so it's--

14:29.469 --> 14:31.104
- It literally looked like

14:29.469 --> 14:31.104
a garage sale.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.773
Like, his stuff--his stuff

14:31.104 --> 14:33.773
flew everywhere.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.307
This is gorgeous.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.307
- This is so pretty.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.769
- You guys look great.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.312
- Y'all also watch for whales

14:37.769 --> 14:39.312
'cause it's whale season.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.780
- I have yet to see one, like,

14:39.312 --> 14:41.780
fly in the air.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.415
- Yeah.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.415
Look what I ordered us.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.552
- Oh, oh my.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.552
- Oh.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.421
- You know the key

14:46.552 --> 14:48.421
to their heart.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.588
- Love ya.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.588
Thanks for coming.

14:49.588 --> 14:50.724
- Cheers.

14:49.588 --> 14:50.724
Thanks for having us.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.919
- Love y'all.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.919
- Is this a bloody Mary?

14:52.919 --> 14:53.759
- Fun time.

14:52.919 --> 14:53.759
- Yep.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.294
- I've got some plans.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.929
- What are those yellow

14:55.294 --> 14:56.929
things?

14:56.929 --> 14:59.331
- Fish eggs.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.331
Aren't they?

14:59.331 --> 15:03.503
They are, aren't they?

15:03.503 --> 15:04.604
- All the smells.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.773
- No.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.308
- You better go pee on a

15:06.773 --> 15:09.308
stick.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.509
Wouldn't that be something?

15:10.509 --> 15:11.778
- Oh, it'd be great.

15:10.509 --> 15:11.778
- Yeah.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.312
I mean, we're

15:11.778 --> 15:13.312
definitely trying.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.481
We just don't know

15:13.312 --> 15:15.481
when we'll be pregnant.

15:15.481 --> 15:16.816
- Tell your dad

15:15.481 --> 15:16.816
we're having a baby.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.586
- What?

15:16.816 --> 15:20.586
- In 2021.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.756
- It's not, like, on a

15:20.586 --> 15:23.756
schedule where we're, like,

15:23.756 --> 15:25.792
on an ovulation calendar.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.792
Like, I'm just more, like--

15:25.792 --> 15:27.192
- Like, time to go.

15:27.192 --> 15:28.827
- Yeah. Like, if it happens,

15:27.192 --> 15:28.827
it happens.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.629
- Took the goalie

15:28.827 --> 15:30.629
out of the place, so I mean...

15:30.629 --> 15:32.664
- She shoots.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.664
She scores.

15:32.664 --> 15:35.467
- He shoots. He scores.

15:32.664 --> 15:35.467
- God!

15:35.467 --> 15:39.505
- Well, the reason

15:35.467 --> 15:39.505
I wanted you guys

15:39.505 --> 15:44.543
to come--I'm gonna ask Tammy

15:39.505 --> 15:44.543
to marry me.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.547
I'm gonna renew our vows.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.547
- Aww.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.648
- I'm glad we can be here

15:47.547 --> 15:48.648
the second time around.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.115
- That's sweet.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.418
- Yeah, well,

15:50.115 --> 15:51.418
that's why you're here.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.486
I don't have a lot

15:52.686 --> 15:54.486
of regrets in life,

15:54.486 --> 15:57.856
but not having the kids there

15:54.486 --> 15:57.856
for the first wedding--yeah,

15:57.856 --> 15:59.919
you know,

15:57.856 --> 15:59.919
that's something I regret.

15:59.919 --> 16:02.279
You weren't here

15:59.919 --> 16:02.279
for the first time,

16:02.279 --> 16:03.797
and probably a good thing

16:02.279 --> 16:03.797
you weren't,

16:03.797 --> 16:05.331
'cause if everybody

16:03.797 --> 16:05.331
had been flying in,

16:05.331 --> 16:06.666
I'd have been flying out.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.360
- You would've been like,

16:06.666 --> 16:10.360
"Out."

16:10.360 --> 16:12.379
- There's nothing

16:10.360 --> 16:12.379
more embarrassing,

16:12.379 --> 16:15.409
nothing I'm more ashamed of,

16:15.409 --> 16:19.546
than knowing that I've been

16:15.409 --> 16:19.546
through four weddings.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.470
- How long were

16:19.546 --> 16:21.470
you married to JoJo?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.186
- Six weeks.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.955
- Six weeks?

16:26.186 --> 16:28.955
- Wow, what a lucky lady.

16:29.688 --> 16:32.759
What about Melissa Babish?

16:29.688 --> 16:32.759
How long were y'all married?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.360
- About 10 months.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.960
- Did you propose

16:34.360 --> 16:36.960
to any of them?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.431
- I never was gonna get

16:36.960 --> 16:38.431
on my knee, you know.

16:38.431 --> 16:42.869
I think a lot of it--

16:38.431 --> 16:42.869
a lot of it had to do with--

16:42.869 --> 16:44.537
I didn't wanna fail again.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.107
It's my fourth wedding

16:48.107 --> 16:51.911
and, I can promise you,

16:48.107 --> 16:51.911
my last.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.712
You know, I got the right gal,

16:53.712 --> 16:56.820
and it just kinda

16:53.712 --> 16:56.820
makes it complete

16:56.820 --> 16:59.586
if I redo it--renew the vows

16:56.820 --> 16:59.586
and my children are there.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.922
- It's a shock to your ego

17:00.220 --> 17:02.922
to keep getting married

17:02.922 --> 17:04.590
and divorced.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.590
It's like when Rachel

17:04.590 --> 17:06.226
tells us she gets

17:04.590 --> 17:06.226
a new boyfriend, we're like--

17:06.226 --> 17:08.279
- Oh, okay.

- I don't trust it.

17:37.569 --> 17:38.910
I think that's something

Pappy ate a worm.

- This is so pretty.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.145
- I know.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.145
I love the flowers.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.554
- Hey, you know,

18:07.554 --> 18:09.855
tonight I'm gonna do something

18:07.554 --> 18:09.855
I've never done before.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.558
I'm gonna get down on one knee

18:09.855 --> 18:12.558
and ask Tammy to marry me.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.599
I'm a little bit nervous.

18:14.599 --> 18:15.461
- Pappy.

18:14.599 --> 18:15.461
- Huh?

18:15.461 --> 18:16.563
- This is your night.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.763
- My night.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.763
- You got it.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.650
- Okay, thanks.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.650
- Focus.

18:19.650 --> 18:20.799
- Is this a cheer--

18:19.650 --> 18:20.799
- Focus.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.501
- Okay.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.476
- Okay, you can stop

18:26.472 --> 18:29.476
focusing now.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.112
- Let me have your all--

18:29.476 --> 18:32.112
let me have your attention.

One of the reasons--the main

18:37.717 --> 18:40.953
reason--the only reason to--

18:40.953 --> 18:43.559
- Are you nervous?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.559
- A little bit.

- Are you feeling

18:43.559 --> 18:44.223
a little nervous?

coming up on seven years ago,

18:49.395 --> 18:51.463
we did it really fast,

18:51.463 --> 18:54.667
and the only thing missing

18:51.463 --> 18:54.667
was you.

I never did this before.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.210

19:06.119 --> 19:08.548
- I don't think which knee

19:06.119 --> 19:08.548
you go on matters.

- Aww.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.269
without you,

19:21.269 --> 19:24.299
voice and your face

19:24.299 --> 19:27.099

21:02.561 --> 21:04.763
about.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.660
- Hold it.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.680
Left hand.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.680
Now do this.

21:08.680 --> 21:09.602
The pump--come up higher.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.710
No--no, right there.

21:11.710 --> 21:14.540
Look, like that, okay?

21:14.540 --> 21:15.607
- Oh.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.607
- Oh!

21:15.607 --> 21:17.309
- There it is.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.611
Keep your head down.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.613
*

21:20.613 --> 21:22.214
- They're gonna have to get

21:20.613 --> 21:22.214
that ball picker-upper

21:22.214 --> 21:24.839
by the time I'm done.

21:24.839 --> 21:25.652
- Whoo.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.886
- Like, wasn't last night

21:25.652 --> 21:27.886
cool? - It was very fun.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.255
- Did you ever think

21:27.886 --> 21:29.255
I'd get down on my knee

21:29.255 --> 21:30.423
and ask someone to marry?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.925
- No, I'm very proud of you.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.760
- I mean, getting married

21:32.925 --> 21:34.760
is a huge thing,

21:34.760 --> 21:36.996
and it hadn't been exactly...

21:36.996 --> 21:40.933
the strength of my life,

21:36.996 --> 21:40.933
that's for sure so.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.902
- The first time,

21:40.933 --> 21:42.902
it kind of hurt my feelings

21:42.902 --> 21:45.971
that we weren't included.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.741
- I never thought that it

21:45.971 --> 21:48.741
would hurt your feelings

21:48.741 --> 21:50.175
seriously.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.644
I never gave

21:50.175 --> 21:52.644
any thought to that,

21:52.644 --> 21:53.779
and I should have,

21:53.779 --> 21:56.849
so I apologize for that.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.585
This is my family.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.319
Two girls, stepdaughter,

21:58.585 --> 22:00.319
two son-in-laws, grandkids,

22:00.319 --> 22:03.189
closest part of my world

22:00.319 --> 22:03.189
right there.

22:03.189 --> 22:06.589
- To hear Dad say

22:03.189 --> 22:06.589
that he really regrets

22:06.589 --> 22:08.609
that we weren't there

22:06.589 --> 22:08.609
for the first wedding,

22:08.609 --> 22:09.796
it's a super vulnerable

22:08.609 --> 22:09.796
moment.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.631
He doesn't really talk

22:09.796 --> 22:11.631
like that very often,

22:11.631 --> 22:13.432
so it does mean a lot.

22:13.432 --> 22:14.867
- It takes a lot to kind of

22:13.432 --> 22:14.867
admit something like that,

22:14.867 --> 22:17.336
especially to your two--

22:14.867 --> 22:17.336
to your two daughters.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.373
- We appreciate you

22:17.336 --> 22:20.373
including us this time.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.674
- Made it a lot better.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.509
- Love you.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.178
- Thank you.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.346
Thanks for being

22:25.178 --> 22:27.346
a great daughter.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.815
- You're welcome.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.815
- Okay?

22:28.815 --> 22:31.839
- Love you.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.220
- As kids?

22:34.220 --> 22:36.823
- That too, I know

22:34.220 --> 22:36.823
I'm a light in your life.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.525
- A dim one!

22:36.823 --> 22:38.525
- What?

22:38.525 --> 22:40.930
Dad.

22:40.930 --> 22:43.960
[lively surf rock]

22:43.960 --> 22:46.499
*

22:46.499 --> 22:47.901
- Where'd the mountains go?

22:47.901 --> 22:49.336
- Yeah, clouds are moving in.

22:49.336 --> 22:50.703
- It's so peaceful here

22:49.336 --> 22:50.703
in the morning.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.105
- Yeah.

22:52.105 --> 22:54.140
- You think it's gonna be

22:52.105 --> 22:54.140
that way in Texas?

22:54.140 --> 22:58.177
- No. We're giving up birds

22:54.140 --> 22:58.177
chirping for train horns.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.479
- We're just trying

22:58.177 --> 22:59.479
something new.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.681
Last year

22:59.479 --> 23:01.681
Terry would not let up

23:01.681 --> 23:03.148
about us moving

23:01.681 --> 23:03.148
from Hawaii to Texas.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.317
- Wow!

23:03.148 --> 23:04.317
- Key chain.

23:04.317 --> 23:06.152
- It says "Pappy."

23:06.152 --> 23:08.688
- Just figure we got to go

23:06.152 --> 23:08.688
home to pack all our things up

23:08.688 --> 23:11.191
and move 'em over here

23:08.688 --> 23:11.191
into the new house.

23:11.191 --> 23:13.226
- In Texas.

23:11.191 --> 23:13.226
- Are--are you serious?

23:13.226 --> 23:14.661
- But then the pandemic

23:13.226 --> 23:14.661
happened

23:14.661 --> 23:16.563
and it just didn't make sense

23:14.661 --> 23:16.563
for our family.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.731
So we finally agreed to live

23:16.563 --> 23:18.731
in Texas half of the year

23:18.731 --> 23:20.660
and so we're renting

23:18.731 --> 23:20.660
a house there.

23:20.660 --> 23:21.835
So just half there, half here.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.269
Half my family,

23:21.835 --> 23:23.269
half your family.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.704
Sounds ideal, really.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.704
[laughter]

23:25.704 --> 23:27.173
- Just enough

23:25.704 --> 23:27.173
till you get tired of 'em

23:27.173 --> 23:27.941
and then you switch.

23:27.173 --> 23:27.941
- Uh-huh, and then you switch.

23:27.941 --> 23:29.241
- Yeah.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.542
- I'm excited

23:29.241 --> 23:30.542
'cause Zuri is really,

23:30.542 --> 23:32.112
really happy to go back.

23:32.112 --> 23:33.747
- Yeah, she got the horses.

23:32.112 --> 23:33.747
That makes her happy.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.548
- Mm-hmm.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.548
- She got Gigi and Pappy.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.218
- Yes. I really thought we

23:35.548 --> 23:38.218
were moving to Texas for our

23:35.548 --> 23:38.218
family,

23:38.218 --> 23:39.952
but I'm pretty sure

23:38.218 --> 23:39.952
ulterior motives are

23:39.952 --> 23:41.855
Noah just wants

23:39.952 --> 23:41.855
to be close to Terry.

23:41.855 --> 23:44.124
- So welcome to our crib

23:41.855 --> 23:44.124
with Noah.

23:44.124 --> 23:45.625
- Oh, thank you for having me.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.361
- What are we cooking today

23:45.625 --> 23:48.361
for the Bradshaws?

23:48.361 --> 23:49.729
- Eggs Florentine.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.463
- Look right here, Noah.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.099
- Dad, no, no. Serious--

24:00.640 --> 24:02.642
Oh.

24:02.642 --> 24:05.450
- I mean, you guys

24:02.642 --> 24:05.450
are like the two stooges.

24:05.450 --> 24:06.945
- Am I Curly or Moe?

24:06.945 --> 24:08.714
- Ugh.

24:08.714 --> 24:09.915
We leave next week.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.451
You feel like you're ready?

24:11.451 --> 24:13.859
- Luckily, I've got a list.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.859
- Oh, you have a list?

24:13.859 --> 24:14.386
- I have a checklist.

24:13.859 --> 24:14.386
- Let me see it.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.954
- It's four pages.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.954
- What?

24:15.954 --> 24:17.257
- Yeah, we're leaving

24:15.954 --> 24:17.257
for six months.

24:17.257 --> 24:18.324
- Why are you like this?

24:18.324 --> 24:21.461
[laughter]

24:21.461 --> 24:23.395
- What'd you say, gang?

24:21.461 --> 24:23.395
Oh!

24:23.395 --> 24:24.596
- What the hell?

24:24.596 --> 24:26.665
- What is this?

24:24.596 --> 24:26.665
- What is that?

24:26.665 --> 24:27.933
- Oh, that's Tammy's face?

24:27.933 --> 24:30.269
- Wow.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.269
- You like it?

24:30.269 --> 24:33.440
- Eh.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.440
[laughter]

24:33.440 --> 24:34.807
- This is beautiful.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.308
- This is like the first time

24:34.807 --> 24:36.308
we sat down here

24:36.308 --> 24:37.911
and enjoyed the view.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.578
There's a whale.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.578
- Oh, wow.

24:39.578 --> 24:40.613
See the blow.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.614
- Where are you looking for?

24:41.614 --> 24:42.515
Is your ship coming in?

24:42.515 --> 24:43.750
- Where?

24:43.750 --> 24:46.185
- That's what I'm asking you.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.253
Dinner last night

24:46.185 --> 24:48.253
with everybody was nice.

24:48.253 --> 24:49.622
- I was nervous.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.257
- You were nervous.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.325
- I was.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.325
- Why?

24:52.325 --> 24:53.859
Did you think I might say no?

24:53.859 --> 24:56.528
- No.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.530
- I wasn't expecting

24:56.528 --> 24:58.530
any of it, actually.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.700
- And then you started crying.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.134
- It's because you did.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.470
- Mm-mm.

25:03.470 --> 25:05.380
- You did.

25:03.470 --> 25:05.380
- No.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.172
- Uh-huh.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.374
- Well, whatever.

25:07.374 --> 25:08.942
- Okay.

25:08.942 --> 25:11.845
- I thought I didn't do it

25:08.942 --> 25:11.845
right the first time.

25:11.845 --> 25:13.346
- I don't think

25:11.845 --> 25:13.346
you did it wrong.

25:13.346 --> 25:17.851
- One of the reasons that I

25:13.346 --> 25:17.851
wanted to renew the vows

25:17.851 --> 25:19.685
I wanted all the girls

25:17.851 --> 25:19.685
to be here.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.549
- Yeah.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.549
So you've--you've got

25:22.549 --> 25:24.569
this whole plan planned,

25:22.549 --> 25:24.569
is that right?

25:24.569 --> 25:27.160
- What?

25:24.569 --> 25:27.160
- For the event?

25:27.160 --> 25:29.295
You didn't--

25:27.160 --> 25:29.295
you don't have a plan.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.830
- We're getting--renewing

25:29.295 --> 25:31.830
our vows, that's our plan.

25:31.830 --> 25:35.201
- Okay.

25:31.830 --> 25:35.201
Where are we gonna do it?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.736
- I don't know.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.736
- Is it Saturday?

25:36.736 --> 25:38.171
- Yeah, no.

25:38.171 --> 25:39.506
- You got any flowers?

25:38.171 --> 25:39.506
- No.

25:39.506 --> 25:42.342
- What time?

25:42.342 --> 25:43.375
- What time do you want

25:42.342 --> 25:43.375
to do it?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.510
Do we need a cake?

25:44.510 --> 25:46.112
- Do they make those?

25:47.212 --> 25:50.250
[chickens clucking]

25:50.250 --> 25:51.884
Yeeh.

25:51.884 --> 25:56.556
I got so wrapped up

25:51.884 --> 25:56.556
in the marriage proposal

25:56.556 --> 25:59.659
that I forgot

25:56.556 --> 25:59.659
to plan for the marriage.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.227

the ways of men.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.832
- All right,

26:03.529 --> 26:05.832
who's performing the ceremony?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.329
Do you have someone?

26:07.329 --> 26:08.567
- I asked Lacy.

26:07.329 --> 26:08.567
She's ordained.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.336
- That'd be great, yeah.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.439
- You want me to do what?

26:10.336 --> 26:12.439
- Marry us.

26:12.439 --> 26:14.173
That saves money.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.376
- No, no, I am very expensive.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.211
- How about it right here?

26:17.376 --> 26:19.211
If we can have the whales.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.579
- I know.

26:51.344 --> 26:52.711
- This is not--

26:51.344 --> 26:52.711

26:52.711 --> 26:54.381

26:52.711 --> 26:54.381

26:54.381 --> 26:55.582
Go, go underneath.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.852
- No, don't burn my hair.

26:58.852 --> 27:00.686
Hey.

26:58.852 --> 27:00.686
- I hope no one's watching.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.922
- It's a little freaking too

27:00.686 --> 27:02.922
close there with that head.

- That's love right there.

27:11.498 --> 27:13.866
- How do you know

27:11.498 --> 27:13.866
when you really love somebody?

27:13.866 --> 27:16.869
- You can't stop thinking

27:13.866 --> 27:16.869
about them and your heart

27:13.866 --> 27:16.869
flutters.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.938
You want them always

27:16.869 --> 27:18.938
in your life.

27:18.938 --> 27:22.208
It's a good feeling being

27:18.938 --> 27:22.208
in love with the right person.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.876
- If your first wedding

27:22.208 --> 27:23.876
was so perfect,

27:23.876 --> 27:25.679
why are you doing it again?

27:25.679 --> 27:28.480
- Because nobody was there.

27:25.679 --> 27:28.480
None of the family was there.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.182
- What are you

27:28.480 --> 27:29.182
sitting around for?

27:29.182 --> 27:30.450
You have a wedding

27:29.182 --> 27:30.450
to plan today.

27:30.450 --> 27:32.519
Hurry.

27:32.519 --> 27:33.853
- I'm pacing myself.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.387
- Help me, Pappy!

27:35.387 --> 27:37.423
The kite's flying away!

27:37.423 --> 27:38.590
Pappy!

27:40.527 --> 27:47.733
*

27:47.733 --> 27:51.604

27:47.733 --> 27:51.604
back out of this.

27:51.604 --> 27:52.905

27:51.604 --> 27:52.905
- Cold feet?

27:52.905 --> 27:54.641
Let's run.

27:54.641 --> 27:56.576
- Oh, you're talking about the

27:54.641 --> 27:56.576
marriage, not the driveway.

27:56.576 --> 27:58.278
[laughter]

27:58.278 --> 28:01.714

28:01.714 --> 28:03.883

28:03.883 --> 28:04.917
- Don't mess it up.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.554
- Don't drop it.

28:07.554 --> 28:09.655
- What do you think our girls

28:07.554 --> 28:09.655
are doing today?

28:09.655 --> 28:11.910
- Hmm.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.910
- Probably just complaining

28:11.910 --> 28:12.920
about us.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.599
[laughter]

28:14.599 --> 28:16.496

Okay, touch your toes.

28:22.501 --> 28:23.769
- Oh, my boobs are out.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.305
- Downward dog, glute.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.305
Left leg up.

28:25.305 --> 28:28.740
- Oh, my Botox

28:25.305 --> 28:28.740
is gonna wear off.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.709
No, I don't like this.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.811
- Grab your foot.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.513
- Oh, no, (BLEEP) that.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.513
I'm not doing that.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.348
You're making this up.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.348
This is not a move.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.518
- Not fu--this is Bikram Yoga,

28:36.348 --> 28:38.518
bitch.

28:38.518 --> 28:41.320
Yoga always just soothes me

28:38.518 --> 28:41.320
and calms me down.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.559
Namaste.

28:43.559 --> 28:45.491
- Oh. Well, I'm a stay over

28:43.559 --> 28:45.491
here so.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.794
I've actually never been more

28:45.491 --> 28:47.794
stressed than during that

28:45.491 --> 28:47.794
yoga.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.962
- Than doing yoga?

28:47.794 --> 28:49.962
- For--for five minutes.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.964
- Has Dad, like, planned this?

28:51.964 --> 28:53.298
- You're asking

28:51.964 --> 28:53.298
the wrong person.

28:53.298 --> 28:54.834
I'm such a planner.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.368
I feel like I have anxiety

28:54.834 --> 28:56.368
for everyone.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.138
- Music, food, attire.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.272
So who's the coordinator?

29:00.272 --> 29:01.807
- I don't think there is one.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.777
- I know how much stuff

29:01.807 --> 29:03.777
that Dad hasn't even thought

29:03.777 --> 29:06.479
about to make this

29:03.777 --> 29:06.479
a decent moment.

29:06.479 --> 29:09.150
And I'm like, he doesn't even

29:06.479 --> 29:09.150
know where to get flowers.

29:09.150 --> 29:11.183
- I'm still just stressed

29:09.150 --> 29:11.183
about yoga.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.185
[laughter]

29:13.185 --> 29:15.821
- I bought Lacey flowers

29:13.185 --> 29:15.821
for an entire year.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.691
I called the florist

29:15.821 --> 29:17.691
and I said, "Every week,

29:17.691 --> 29:19.792
deliver me a bouquet of

29:17.691 --> 29:19.792
flowers for an entire year."

29:19.792 --> 29:21.326
- Now, that is--

29:19.792 --> 29:21.326
that--that's sweet.

29:21.326 --> 29:22.194
- That's what I thought.

29:21.326 --> 29:22.194
You know what she said?

29:22.194 --> 29:23.630
She said, "No, no,

29:23.630 --> 29:25.309
"you just made it easier

29:23.630 --> 29:25.309
for yourself

29:25.309 --> 29:27.329
"so you pre-ordered

29:25.309 --> 29:27.329
all the flowers

29:27.329 --> 29:28.134
so it's not romantic anymore."

29:28.134 --> 29:30.700
- Ooh!

29:28.134 --> 29:30.700
- Oh!

29:30.700 --> 29:31.904
- I would cancel that order.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.573
- She thought that through.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.573
- Yeah.

29:33.573 --> 29:35.407
- For an entire year,

29:33.573 --> 29:35.407
you don't have to think

29:35.407 --> 29:37.576
about getting me flowers.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.576
They just show up.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.677
- But why don't you

29:37.576 --> 29:38.677
think about it

29:39.712 --> 29:40.480
like for an entire year

29:39.712 --> 29:40.480
you get flowers.

29:40.480 --> 29:41.914
- I think it's great.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.583
I just wish that you thought

29:41.914 --> 29:43.583
of me when you got them.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.317
- I did when I called them

29:45.317 --> 29:47.220
and said "Bring it on a

29:45.317 --> 29:47.220
different day every week."

29:47.220 --> 29:48.755
- You said that because

29:47.220 --> 29:48.755
you didn't want me

29:48.755 --> 29:51.569
to know it was a subscription.

29:51.569 --> 29:52.925
- She really did that, Bub?

29:51.569 --> 29:52.925
- Yeah.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.594
Are you sh---ing me?

29:54.594 --> 29:56.496
Don't lie to me.

29:54.594 --> 29:56.496
No, you're not--are you se--

29:56.496 --> 29:57.896
- No, I swear to God.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.165

30:19.853 --> 30:22.788
to those, I bet.

39:20.626 --> 39:23.128
Great. Mark it off the list.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.431
- Set it and forget it.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.431
- Oh, my God.

39:24.431 --> 39:26.989
- Lot of appeal.

39:26.989 --> 39:27.701
- Everything's fine.

Everything's fine.

you flowers every month."

39:29.601 --> 39:30.804
And I'm like, "Yeah,

39:29.601 --> 39:30.804
because you signed up for it."

to you.

- Yeah!

39:33.907 --> 39:35.407
It's not like you think

39:33.907 --> 39:35.407
about it.

[all speaking at once]

39:37.309 --> 39:40.413

39:45.784 --> 39:46.952
- I thought of it.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.155
[laughter]

39:49.155 --> 39:53.590
I think today

39:49.155 --> 39:53.590
I-I deserve a gold star.

39:53.590 --> 39:55.661
- Yes, a gold star for you.
