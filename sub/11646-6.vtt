WEBVTT

00:09.433 --> 00:11.732
- Alex is gay.
- If you didn't want to come to mine,

00:11.779 --> 00:14.138
why didn't you just say?
You make up some bullshit story?

00:14.143 --> 00:15.863
You could come over later
and watch a DVD.

00:15.864 --> 00:17.784
It's cos you want to get
in my knickers, right?

00:17.785 --> 00:18.705
I'll settle for a kiss.

00:18.706 --> 00:22.502
Finn showed me this video of you and
this guy in an underground car park.

00:22.543 --> 00:24.942
I think he's paying him for sex.

00:24.943 --> 00:27.462
I didn't want to believe it,
and then we come back here

00:27.463 --> 00:29.862
and there's photos of you
with your arm round some guy,

00:29.863 --> 00:31.062
and you're cooking!

00:31.063 --> 00:32.502
You really like her, don't you?

00:32.503 --> 00:34.862
I always have done.

00:34.863 --> 00:38.142
She acts all tough, but she's not.
And I know I can make her happy.

00:38.143 --> 00:41.782
Just so you know,
Alex "from the bar" is so not gay.

00:41.783 --> 00:44.182
I'm sure he'll make someone
a lovely husband.

00:44.183 --> 00:46.182
Or should I say "civil partner"?

00:46.183 --> 00:50.182
"Twat"!

00:52.983 --> 00:56.822
Listen to me. Show me your cock
and I'll let you go.

00:56.823 --> 01:00.822
Show me your cock!

01:07.823 --> 01:11.822
Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Those are a mistake, by the way!

01:12.103 --> 01:12.862
What are?

01:12.863 --> 01:14.782
Light-coloured trousers.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.063
Honestly, that's a basic
schoolboy error, that is, mate.

01:17.064 --> 01:18.024
What's wrong with these?

01:18.025 --> 01:21.662
What's wrong with these?
We're about to enter a war zone.

01:22.423 --> 01:23.742
It's going to get really messy.

01:23.743 --> 01:26.942
Honestly, man, it's going to be
the most insane house party

01:26.943 --> 01:29.342
you've ever been to
in your shitty little life.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:41.943 --> 01:43.902
Strangers are going to fuck strangers.

01:43.903 --> 01:47.342
Heads are going to get shaved.

01:47.343 --> 01:49.262
There'll be puke, blood,
sperm and piss.

01:49.263 --> 01:50.382
Will there be a buffet?

01:50.383 --> 01:54.382
Yes, there'll be a buffet. A buffet
of drugs, alcohol and shagging.

02:03.983 --> 02:06.622
This is Richard Saunders.
Do you understand me?

02:06.623 --> 02:10.622
Richard "The Colonel" Saunders.
He's a fucking lunatic.

02:16.543 --> 02:18.423
Y'know, they used to call him
Richie Two-Tabs.

02:18.424 --> 02:20.462
Because he used to drop two
tabs of acid

02:20.463 --> 02:23.742
before he'd even got out of
friggin' bed in t'morning.

02:23.743 --> 02:27.302
So, to summarise,
a Richard Saunders house party

02:27.303 --> 02:30.182
is absolutely no place
for fucking chinos, man.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.502
Well, they aren't chinos, so...

02:31.503 --> 02:32.262
They are chinos.

02:32.263 --> 02:33.542
Hiya.

02:33.543 --> 02:34.422
You all right?

02:34.423 --> 02:35.022
All right?

02:35.023 --> 02:36.822
Are you ready for the carnage?

02:36.823 --> 02:38.062
What you on about?

02:38.063 --> 02:42.062
Oh, you'll see. You'll see
what I'm on about.

02:43.503 --> 02:45.822
Are we going to this party, or what?

02:45.823 --> 02:49.822
Yeah.

03:47.383 --> 03:51.342
Trust me, you will never forget your
first Richard Saunders house party.

03:51.343 --> 03:53.822
Guaranteed.

03:53.823 --> 03:56.902
Honestly, Colonel Saunders
is a fucking legend.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.902
Aw... it's going to be buzzing.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.339
I like your top.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.099
It's nice. What do you call
that kind of top?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.639
It's just a top.

04:15.724 --> 04:17.123
It's not like a halterneck.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.202
I know.

04:20.204 --> 04:23.523
No, it's nice, whatever it is.
It's a nice top.

04:23.524 --> 04:27.523
Yeah. Thanks.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.323
Oh, you made it!

04:33.324 --> 04:35.243
I can't find this party.

04:35.244 --> 04:37.763
I know where it is. It's down here
somewhere. Follow me.

04:37.764 --> 04:39.363
I like your top.

04:39.364 --> 04:41.003
Good colour on you.

04:41.004 --> 04:44.243
Thanks!

04:44.244 --> 04:48.243
Fuck's sake.

04:50.604 --> 04:52.683
Oh, yes!

04:52.684 --> 04:54.043
Right. Now, then...

04:54.044 --> 04:56.043
Wait! Whoo! What you doing?

04:56.044 --> 04:57.803
Listen, brace yourself.
All right?

04:57.804 --> 05:01.803
This thing is going to hit you
like a train.

05:01.804 --> 05:04.603
- So you do some deep breaths.
- In through the nose...

05:06.684 --> 05:08.603
out through the mouth.

05:09.564 --> 05:13.563
It's good stuff.
I'll see you on the other side.

05:23.404 --> 05:26.123
N-N-N-No! This... this is
bubbling under nicely.

05:26.124 --> 05:29.283
We just need to get ourselves
a drink, we need to get settled,

05:29.284 --> 05:33.283
cos there is a hurricane
a-coming! It's on its way.

05:35.284 --> 05:36.483
It's a weird party.

05:36.484 --> 05:38.203
Yeah, it's pretty weird.

05:38.204 --> 05:42.203
Hey! Seen this?
Saunders, the mad bastard, 'ey?

05:42.484 --> 05:44.683
Everyone's drinking sherry.

05:44.684 --> 05:48.323
Honestly! It's going to go fucking
mental in here, I'm telling you!

05:48.622 --> 05:49.661
Really?

05:49.662 --> 05:50.941
Mm.

05:50.942 --> 05:52.141
This is a wake.

05:52.142 --> 05:53.741
What are you on about?

05:55.142 --> 05:58.221
It's a funeral.

05:58.222 --> 05:59.421
Ohh...

05:59.422 --> 06:02.661
No, it's not.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.221
Don't fucking...

06:04.222 --> 06:05.381
Saunders, no!

06:06.822 --> 06:08.941
He's me best...

06:08.942 --> 06:12.141
He's me best friend.
Why do only the good die young?

06:12.142 --> 06:15.421
It's some old woman called Glenda.

06:15.422 --> 06:17.981
It's the wrong flat.
Get... get your shit.

06:17.982 --> 06:21.981
It's the wrong flat.

06:24.062 --> 06:26.821
So, erm, this is a great night.

06:26.822 --> 06:30.461
Scotch eggs if you're hungry.

06:30.462 --> 06:33.061
Oh, my God.
You stole from a funeral.

06:33.062 --> 06:34.941
I'm impressed!

06:34.942 --> 06:36.781
If you think that's good...

06:36.782 --> 06:37.381
Ohhh!

06:37.382 --> 06:39.821
Ah, cheesy pineapple.

06:39.822 --> 06:41.861
It's definitely on this floor.

06:41.862 --> 06:45.621
- Why don't you just ring him?
- I might just ring him.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.901
Just ring him up.
Probably won't answer.

06:47.902 --> 06:50.021
Probably lost his phone again.

06:50.022 --> 06:51.501
Fuckin' maniac.

06:53.542 --> 06:54.742
I didn't know you were coming.

06:54.743 --> 06:56.861
Yeah. Jess asked me.

06:56.862 --> 06:58.701
Is that all right wi' you?

06:58.702 --> 07:01.261
It's absolutely fine.

07:01.262 --> 07:04.221
Hey, here he is!
How you doing, you cunt?!

07:04.222 --> 07:06.461
You all right, Saunders?

07:06.462 --> 07:09.661
Yeah, listen.
Bit... bit of a problem.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.541
I forgot where you live.

07:12.542 --> 07:13.861
Nice one.

07:13.862 --> 07:15.061
See you there.

07:15.062 --> 07:18.541
We're on the wrong floor.
Get back in t'lift. Shit.

07:23.342 --> 07:25.621
If you haven't got anything
to hide, then just say.

07:25.622 --> 07:26.901
I don't see why it matters.

07:26.902 --> 07:28.261
It matters to me.

07:28.262 --> 07:31.901
So just tell me, how many people
have you slept with?

07:31.902 --> 07:35.261
Fine. It's four.

07:35.262 --> 07:37.741
Before you, I slept with four guys.

07:37.742 --> 07:41.741
Fucking liar.

07:42.422 --> 07:44.261
Yeah, this is it.

07:54.662 --> 07:57.101
Welcome to the jungle.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.101
I'm going to get us a drink.

07:59.102 --> 08:03.101
I'm going to check in with t'Colonel.

08:06.782 --> 08:08.541
Why have you got a 2 on your head?

08:08.542 --> 08:09.781
Why have you got a 1?

08:09.782 --> 08:13.781
What?

08:14.102 --> 08:15.381
I didn't do that.

08:15.382 --> 08:16.541
It's not coming off.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.661
How the fuck did it get on there?

08:18.662 --> 08:20.741
Oi! Shit, mate. Oi, check this out.

08:20.742 --> 08:24.621
Turns out I've been going round
with a bloody big 99 on me head,

08:24.622 --> 08:26.541
which, strangely enough,

08:26.542 --> 08:30.301
is the exact amount of girls
I've slept with, dude.

08:30.302 --> 08:34.301
I keep a list.
I've got to keep a record.

08:34.861 --> 08:37.941
I just want to keep tabs on where
he's been. It's like service history!

08:37.942 --> 08:40.020
Can I just say...?

08:40.022 --> 08:43.341
Long-term relationship,
so no shame in that.

08:43.342 --> 08:44.781
There's deep shame in that.

08:44.782 --> 08:47.701
OK. Any idea why I've got
the number 46 on my head?

08:47.702 --> 08:51.381
Yes, because you are a fucking Viking.

08:51.382 --> 08:53.501
Respect to the dark horse.

08:53.502 --> 08:56.221
It's how many "girls"
you've slept with.

08:56.222 --> 08:58.061
Hmm.

08:58.062 --> 09:00.861
Is this some kind of power thing?

09:00.862 --> 09:04.701
How do you know about powers?

09:04.702 --> 09:07.301
I just do.

09:07.302 --> 09:09.701
What about you, then?

09:09.702 --> 09:12.061
Are the goods still intact, or...?

09:12.062 --> 09:14.901
Unlike yours,
which must be fucking disgusting,

09:14.902 --> 09:17.141
like an old banana
that's been left out in the sun.

09:17.142 --> 09:19.941
How come someone as fit as you
only has shagged two people?

09:19.942 --> 09:22.261
Cos it's not like
you don't get offers, is it?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.021
Are you just not that bothered
about cock?

09:24.022 --> 09:26.141
It doesn't make you a lesbian,
or anything.

09:26.142 --> 09:28.821
Cos honestly, lads,
I'm just like this with Twixes.

09:28.822 --> 09:33.661
- I can take 'em or I can leave 'em.
- Just fuck off.

09:33.662 --> 09:35.381
Very angry.

09:35.382 --> 09:39.381
Maybe if she put it about more, she
wouldn't be angry. I'm just saying.

09:54.262 --> 09:55.461
Are you all right?

09:55.462 --> 09:56.541
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:56.542 --> 09:59.021
Alex?

09:59.022 --> 10:01.781
46!

10:01.782 --> 10:03.901
How many of them
do you reckon were blokes?

10:03.902 --> 10:07.901
Can you just go?

10:15.622 --> 10:18.781
Start working
on your friggin' digits, mate.

10:18.782 --> 10:21.221
That is a mark of honour.

10:21.222 --> 10:22.701
It shows I'm a good person.

10:22.702 --> 10:24.341
Do you know...? Here we go.

10:24.342 --> 10:26.821
All right, here's a graph, right?

10:26.822 --> 10:28.661
And down the bottom,
it says "niceness",

10:28.662 --> 10:31.021
and down the side,
it says "number of times

10:31.022 --> 10:33.421
"I've ejaculated inside
a real human woman," right?

10:33.422 --> 10:36.781
And your friggin' graph, dude,
is doing this. Are you watching?

10:36.782 --> 10:37.981
Boom!

10:37.982 --> 10:40.741
All right?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

10:40.742 --> 10:44.141
I don't care about numbers.
It's not about quantity.

10:44.142 --> 10:45.821
It's about quality.

10:45.822 --> 10:49.421
Yeah, right, see her, there?

10:49.422 --> 10:51.181
She is never going to respect you

10:51.182 --> 10:53.501
while you got that on your head,
you moron!

10:53.502 --> 10:55.221
You're wrong.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.061
Because she respects
people with morals.

10:58.062 --> 11:02.061
People who actually stand up
for something. And I reckon...

11:02.822 --> 11:04.501
tonight's the night.

11:04.502 --> 11:07.661
Do you? All right. So while
you're just... jerking off...

11:07.662 --> 11:11.381
into a wet flannel,
like a stinky little Hobbit bitch,

11:11.382 --> 11:13.861
I'm going to be joining
the Hundreds Club, all right?

11:13.862 --> 11:16.261
Here we go, here we go.
Hello, I'm Rudy, how you doing?

11:16.262 --> 11:17.941
I'll be your waiter for the evening.

11:17.942 --> 11:20.341
I'll get you a white wine
spritzer. That's for you.

11:20.342 --> 11:23.101
Why have you got 99 on your head?

11:23.102 --> 11:25.101
Mm, very interesting story about that.

11:25.102 --> 11:28.861
If you'd like to come to the bedroom
with me, I'll just explain it all.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.621
It's very interesting.

11:31.622 --> 11:32.301
All right.

11:32.302 --> 11:36.301
Oh, my God! Hm, hm, hm, hundred.
One hundred.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.901
Fuck off.

11:39.902 --> 11:43.901
Ohh!

11:52.102 --> 11:54.501
Prrrr! No... stop it.

11:54.502 --> 11:56.421
Stop it. Stop it.

11:56.422 --> 11:57.941
Knock it off!

11:57.942 --> 11:59.421
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

11:59.422 --> 12:01.221
I'm just not really feeling it.

12:01.222 --> 12:02.261
What?

12:02.262 --> 12:05.700
Well, it's just if it's going to be
me centenary fuck,

12:05.701 --> 12:08.221
it's gotta be summat special,
hasn't it? You know what I mean?

12:08.222 --> 12:09.541
Summat a bit magical.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.021
It's got to be something
I can tell me grandkids

12:12.022 --> 12:14.661
when they run around me ankles,
you know what I mean?

12:14.662 --> 12:15.821
You're a prick.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.501
Shit, well, sorry you feel that way,

12:17.502 --> 12:19.581
but you know what,
it doesn't change the fact...

12:20.822 --> 12:21.621
What was that?

12:24.942 --> 12:28.061
There's something in that cupboard.

12:28.062 --> 12:29.421
All right.

12:29.422 --> 12:30.981
It's all right, erm...

12:32.502 --> 12:36.021
Ah!

12:36.022 --> 12:39.021
Yeah.

12:39.022 --> 12:43.021
Imagine that.

12:45.702 --> 12:46.541
The white rabbit!

12:46.542 --> 12:48.181
It's him! It's Saunders, he's here.

12:48.182 --> 12:49.781
What you doing in there?

12:49.782 --> 12:52.901
He's coming for us. He's out there!
The white rabbit's coming!

12:52.902 --> 12:54.701
Oh, this is classic Saunders, this is,

12:54.702 --> 12:57.221
trippin' his friggin' balls off.
What have you taken?

12:57.222 --> 12:59.701
It won't mean anything to you,
this, right,

12:59.702 --> 13:03.541
but I'm tellin' you, this is
bloody vintage... vintage Saunders.

13:03.542 --> 13:04.821
The white rabbit.

13:04.822 --> 13:06.141
R-R-Rabbit! White rabbit!

13:28.741 --> 13:32.680
There's no food.

13:32.737 --> 13:34.137
I think we should raid the funeral.

13:34.138 --> 13:36.216
Can we just talk about the numbers?

13:36.217 --> 13:39.176
I guess we should.

13:39.177 --> 13:40.576
46?

13:40.577 --> 13:44.576
Must have been one hell of a weekend.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.136
You could fill a coach with all those.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.496
A fuck bus.

13:49.497 --> 13:51.416
It would be an awkward journey.

13:51.417 --> 13:52.976
Mine...

13:52.977 --> 13:56.976
we could all fit inside a small car,
something like a Vauxhall Corsa.

13:58.697 --> 13:59.936
We'd have a seat left over.

13:59.937 --> 14:01.416
I know what you must think...

14:01.417 --> 14:03.896
No, it's fine. You don't have
to justify yourself to me.

14:03.897 --> 14:07.896
I'm not that person any more.

14:12.137 --> 14:13.256
We should keep drinking.

14:13.257 --> 14:14.336
We definitely should.

14:14.337 --> 14:18.336
OK. My round.

14:22.457 --> 14:24.936
So...

14:24.937 --> 14:28.936
it turns out we've got
something in common.

14:29.657 --> 14:31.736
Neither of us are slags.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.336
A-ha.

14:33.337 --> 14:36.816
Maybe we should do
a bit of bedroom mathematics...

14:36.817 --> 14:40.016
find out if two can go into one.

14:40.017 --> 14:41.576
If I'm two and I'm going into one,

14:41.577 --> 14:43.656
that would mean
that I'm penetrating you.

14:43.657 --> 14:45.856
It was a joke. God...

14:45.857 --> 14:47.256
forget it.

14:47.257 --> 14:49.496
I know you'd rather spend the evening

14:49.497 --> 14:51.296
talking to Mr HIV over there.

14:51.297 --> 14:52.216
I know that, but...

14:52.217 --> 14:56.216
Finn, can we not do this tonight?

15:04.897 --> 15:07.056
Oh, no. No, thank you.
Are you all right?

15:07.057 --> 15:08.816
No.

15:08.817 --> 15:10.216
No.

15:10.217 --> 15:11.376
No.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.256
Hello! Would you...?

15:13.257 --> 15:16.176
Fucking unbelievable.

15:16.177 --> 15:17.336
No!

15:17.337 --> 15:19.416
Oh! Who is that fuckin' guy?

15:19.417 --> 15:22.336
No. Sorry. It's not happening.

15:22.337 --> 15:24.216
Shit! Ooh, 'ey!

15:24.217 --> 15:26.576
You're all right. What's your name?

15:26.678 --> 15:27.517
Holly.

15:27.518 --> 15:28.277
Yeah?

15:28.278 --> 15:29.797
Why've you got a 99 on your head?

15:29.798 --> 15:31.517
That's how aroused I am out of 100.

15:31.518 --> 15:35.517
I'm going to let you know if you get
down to final three. Yeah?

15:36.838 --> 15:38.037
Wanker!

15:38.038 --> 15:40.157
Just conducting
a little field study, eh?

15:40.158 --> 15:43.517
Trying to make a short list
for the Miss 100, aren't I?

15:43.518 --> 15:47.517
Right.

15:47.958 --> 15:50.117
You're sulking
cos you've been blown out the water

15:50.118 --> 15:51.517
by the sexy barman, aren't you?

15:51.518 --> 15:52.637
He's not sexy.

15:52.638 --> 15:53.877
He's quite sexy.

15:53.878 --> 15:55.677
OK, he's quite sexy.

15:55.678 --> 15:59.677
He's got the whole... face thing
going on.

16:00.118 --> 16:01.677
But... so what?

16:01.678 --> 16:04.317
D'you know, I think the best thing
you can do right now,

16:04.318 --> 16:08.037
let's just find someone else
and make her jealous.

16:08.038 --> 16:09.357
Maybe you're right.

16:09.358 --> 16:11.917
Course I'm right.
Uncle Rudy were born right, mate.

16:11.918 --> 16:13.437
99. Let's do this.

16:13.438 --> 16:15.517
Come on, little man.

16:15.518 --> 16:18.397
Richie! I just want to go home.

16:18.398 --> 16:22.357
You can't. The white rabbit's
out there. He's coming for us.

16:22.358 --> 16:24.477
Don't be a prick!

16:24.478 --> 16:28.477
You can't go out there!

16:35.518 --> 16:39.517
White rabbit.

17:06.518 --> 17:09.317
Right, there we go.
Right, that's a freebie.

17:09.318 --> 17:13.317
Pudding is served.

17:13.558 --> 17:16.237
I can't. She...

17:16.238 --> 17:17.117
She's wasted.

17:17.117 --> 17:19.196
Look, mate, there is no law against

17:19.198 --> 17:22.797
fucking a wasted girl.
It's a bloody loophole is what it is.

17:22.798 --> 17:24.757
Right, this is your loophole here.

17:24.758 --> 17:27.877
You take that loophole, you put
your dick through the loophole.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.037
Do you understand me?

17:29.038 --> 17:33.037
Just so we're clear, there is a law
against fucking a drunk girl.

17:33.278 --> 17:37.117
Really, Finlay?

17:37.118 --> 17:38.037
Really?

17:38.038 --> 17:38.597
Yes.

17:38.598 --> 17:41.837
Shit. Right... Right, well,
in that case, drink up. Come on.

17:41.838 --> 17:43.037
Where are we going?

17:43.038 --> 17:44.677
You're not going to get laid here.

17:44.678 --> 17:47.077
You need a party
where the girls are emotional,

17:47.078 --> 17:48.517
a bit confused,

17:48.518 --> 17:51.157
desperate to forget how sad
and miserable their lives are.

17:51.158 --> 17:52.478
Are we going back to the funeral?

17:52.479 --> 17:55.757
Yeah, we're going back
to the funeral. Come on.

17:55.758 --> 17:59.757
Ohh!

18:02.638 --> 18:05.197
Yeah, mate.

18:05.198 --> 18:07.317
'Ey, I think she's the one for you,
in't she?

18:07.318 --> 18:08.677
Do you think she's all right?

18:08.678 --> 18:10.118
Yeah, I think she looks really nice.

18:10.119 --> 18:11.237
I think we should move her.

18:11.238 --> 18:13.237
No, leave her, she's peaceful.

18:13.238 --> 18:14.877
Let's put her inside. Grab her legs.

18:14.878 --> 18:17.437
For fuck's sake!

18:17.438 --> 18:19.357
One, two, three...

18:19.358 --> 18:21.037
Everybody, get out of the way!

18:21.038 --> 18:22.677
Drunk girl coming through.

18:22.678 --> 18:26.677
We haven't spiked her,
so no-one panic.

18:27.358 --> 18:28.957
Excuse me...

18:28.958 --> 18:30.517
Cheers, dude, nice one.

18:30.518 --> 18:31.797
Good God, man!

18:31.798 --> 18:35.437
Right there. All right, mate?

18:35.438 --> 18:39.437
Up we go! Now. Right...

18:43.718 --> 18:45.037
What are you doing?

18:45.038 --> 18:47.517
Just making her comfortable.

18:47.518 --> 18:50.277
Fuckin' idiot.

18:50.278 --> 18:51.797
I'm glad you came.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.557
Me too.

18:55.558 --> 18:57.797
So...

18:57.798 --> 18:58.997
you look nice.

18:58.998 --> 19:02.917
Do I? I was starting to get a bit
self-conscious. It's been, um...

19:02.918 --> 19:05.037
15 minutes since you paid me
a compliment?

19:05.038 --> 19:06.117
No?

19:06.118 --> 19:09.397
No, you look great.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.797
I like your top.

19:10.798 --> 19:12.957
Really?

19:12.958 --> 19:16.957
Yeah.

19:17.998 --> 19:21.397
How about the colour?

19:21.398 --> 19:25.397
Looks good on you.

19:50.518 --> 19:54.517
I... I don't think we should do this
right now.

20:18.598 --> 20:20.917
What?

20:20.918 --> 20:23.997
Just... don't.

20:23.998 --> 20:27.317
What is wrong with you?
You lead me on then fuck me about.

20:27.318 --> 20:28.558
No, it's... It's not like that.

20:28.559 --> 20:29.399
Then what is it like?

20:29.400 --> 20:30.397
It's complicated.

20:30.398 --> 20:33.277
Ohh...

20:33.278 --> 20:37.277
That's it? That's all I'm getting,
"It's complicated"?

20:37.558 --> 20:38.877
Or maybe it's me.

20:38.878 --> 20:40.837
And there wasn't a problem
with the other 46?

20:40.838 --> 20:44.717
Do you know what? I've had enough
of you and your bullshit head games.

20:44.718 --> 20:48.717
Jess, wait.

20:59.438 --> 21:01.197
Hi. I'm Jess.

21:01.198 --> 21:01.717
Will.

21:01.718 --> 21:05.717
Nice to meet you, Will.

21:09.398 --> 21:12.077
Some of these
are very vulnerable, mate, right?

21:12.078 --> 21:15.237
You know, they're weak, bit delicate.

21:15.238 --> 21:17.717
It's time for some
sweet, sweet bereavement pussy.

21:17.718 --> 21:21.357
Hmm! Ooooh!

21:21.358 --> 21:22.277
I dunno about this.

21:22.278 --> 21:25.437
Course you don't. That's why
you're still on that, innit?

21:25.438 --> 21:26.797
Please stop flicking me.

21:26.798 --> 21:29.797
Get your game face on. Hmm? Come on.

21:29.798 --> 21:31.877
Step up to the plate.

21:31.878 --> 21:32.997
Yeah?

21:32.998 --> 21:34.477
Yes.

21:34.478 --> 21:38.477
Yeah?

22:00.518 --> 22:01.877
Hi, I'm Finn.

22:01.878 --> 22:05.517
You've got something in your teeth.

22:19.478 --> 22:20.757
Oh.

22:20.758 --> 22:23.197
It's tragic, innit, really?
Fragility of life.

22:23.198 --> 22:24.517
Mmm.

22:24.518 --> 22:27.517
Puts it all in perspective,
really, all this, doesn't it?

22:27.518 --> 22:28.197
Yeah.

22:28.198 --> 22:29.957
Mmm.

22:29.958 --> 22:32.637
Actually, no.

22:32.638 --> 22:36.037
It doesn't. I think that's just
something people say at funerals

22:36.038 --> 22:37.757
when they can't think of anything else.

22:37.758 --> 22:41.037
Oh.

22:41.038 --> 22:41.997
Er...

22:41.998 --> 22:44.877
Can I interest you in a dry sherry?

22:45.678 --> 22:47.797
Oh. What's the matter with you?

22:47.798 --> 22:48.877
Oi.

22:48.878 --> 22:51.037
Why are you getting upset?

22:51.038 --> 22:53.637
She was a good person.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.357
I'm going to miss her.

22:55.358 --> 22:57.157
Let me sort you out. Um...

22:57.158 --> 22:58.637
Can I just take that, mate?

22:58.638 --> 23:00.717
Cheers. Sorry, dude.

23:00.718 --> 23:01.677
There you are.

23:01.678 --> 23:02.437
Thank you.

23:02.438 --> 23:06.437
It's all right.

23:06.598 --> 23:09.997
You're probably going to feel
like this for a long time, you know,

23:09.998 --> 23:13.557
and then one day, you'll be sitting
there and you'll suddenly realise

23:13.558 --> 23:17.557
that when you think about her, it's...

23:17.718 --> 23:21.117
it's a happy feeling,
you know, instead of...

23:21.118 --> 23:25.117
just instead of it being so sad.

23:25.118 --> 23:27.917
I just think that's when you know
you're all right.

23:27.918 --> 23:31.757
You're right.

23:31.758 --> 23:34.357
It's depressing, innit?

23:34.358 --> 23:35.997
Well, it is a funeral.

23:35.998 --> 23:39.997
Yes, I s'pose it'd be a bit
disrespectful if we were all...

23:40.678 --> 23:43.397
downing shots of vodka
and getting nude.

23:45.038 --> 23:46.157
Thank you.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.997
That's all right.

23:47.998 --> 23:50.117
You've... You've cheered me up.

23:50.118 --> 23:52.077
No worries.

23:52.078 --> 23:55.837
Can I ask... Why have you got
a number on your head?

23:55.838 --> 23:58.677
Oh. It's a long story,
really, that one.

23:58.678 --> 24:00.957
Very long.

24:00.958 --> 24:01.597
Nadine.

24:01.598 --> 24:02.877
Oh, I'm Rudy. Sorry.

24:02.878 --> 24:04.838
How... how come
I didn't see you at the funeral?

24:04.839 --> 24:06.637
Er, I was, er, working.

24:06.638 --> 24:07.957
Where do you work?

24:07.958 --> 24:10.317
At the community centre.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.877
Yeah, I'm a caretaker there.

24:12.878 --> 24:15.477
I like to give a bit back
to t'community, to kids...

24:15.478 --> 24:16.717
That's nice.

24:16.718 --> 24:20.717
Mmm.

24:21.678 --> 24:24.877
Can I get you a drink, then?

24:24.878 --> 24:25.557
Yeah. OK.

24:25.558 --> 24:28.717
Yeah? All right, then,
you stay there, Nadine.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.917
Two dry sherries coming right this way.

24:30.918 --> 24:32.437
Is that the right time?

24:32.438 --> 24:34.037
- 'Ey?
- I have to go.

24:34.038 --> 24:35.917
No, don't go. Please don't.

24:35.918 --> 24:38.037
I wasn't hitting on you,
if that's what you thi...

24:38.038 --> 24:40.197
But it's not
that I don't think you're attractive,

24:40.198 --> 24:42.237
cos... you're beautiful.

24:42.238 --> 24:45.877
It's... The numbers, though,
they don't mean anything. And...

24:45.878 --> 24:48.317
And the 100 thing
I-I don't give a shit about, so...

24:48.318 --> 24:49.997
just stay and have a drink.

24:49.998 --> 24:52.237
It's been really nice meeting you.

24:52.238 --> 24:53.717
Don't go.

24:53.718 --> 24:56.797
What...?

25:00.438 --> 25:04.437
What the fuck was that?

26:12.918 --> 26:15.517
You all right? How's it going?

26:15.518 --> 26:17.277
It isn't.

26:17.278 --> 26:20.637
I just met this girl
who's really nice...

26:20.638 --> 26:23.637
and... different.

26:23.638 --> 26:24.837
Great.

26:24.838 --> 26:26.477
I'm...

26:26.478 --> 26:30.157
I'm made up for you.
Hey, you've finally found Miss 100.

26:30.158 --> 26:32.877
Maybe we should throw
a little ceremony when you shag her,

26:32.878 --> 26:36.437
a bit of... bit of confetti...
nice little trophy, ye-eah!

26:36.438 --> 26:38.877
No. Wasn't like that.

26:38.878 --> 26:42.397
Wasn't like that. It was...

26:42.398 --> 26:45.277
It was something else, wasn't it?

26:45.278 --> 26:49.277
I've not... I never got her number.

26:50.518 --> 26:53.877
Are we OK to mix sweet and savoury?
It's just I'm never sure.

26:53.878 --> 26:57.877
I think you'll be OK.

26:58.998 --> 27:01.157
You have nice eyes.

27:03.678 --> 27:06.037
Hmm!

27:06.038 --> 27:07.717
Ohh!

27:07.718 --> 27:08.877
Sweetheart?

27:08.878 --> 27:10.957
Oi.

27:10.958 --> 27:14.917
Oi! Sweetheart, you all right?

27:14.918 --> 27:17.597
Jesus fuckin'... Jesus Christ!

27:17.598 --> 27:20.277
Fuck!

27:20.278 --> 27:23.757
Oi! Who's there?

27:23.758 --> 27:24.637
Who is it?

27:25.678 --> 27:29.677
Who is it?

27:34.878 --> 27:37.997
What the fuck?!

27:37.998 --> 27:40.157
Come on, come on, for fuck's sake!

27:40.158 --> 27:44.157
Come on.

27:44.518 --> 27:48.517
Come on! Fucking come on!

27:49.398 --> 27:53.397
No. N-N-N-N...

27:54.358 --> 27:56.861
Piss off, rabbit bastard. Fuck!

28:03.595 --> 28:05.654
Fuck me harder.
Really?

28:05.655 --> 28:06.535
Yeah.
Cos I'm already

28:06.596 --> 28:08.715
fucking you pretty hard,
to be honest with you.

28:08.716 --> 28:10.435
I'm reluctant to fuck you any harder.

28:10.436 --> 28:11.755
Oh, yeah, that's it, come on!

28:11.756 --> 28:13.635
OK.
Come on.

28:13.636 --> 28:15.195
Oh, yeah!

28:15.836 --> 28:16.875
How's that?

28:16.876 --> 28:18.715
That's about as hard as I
can fuck. Shut up.

28:18.716 --> 28:20.315
Yep... Shut up.

28:20.316 --> 28:21.355
Come on. Oh, my God.

28:21.356 --> 28:22.955
Oh! Ohh...

28:22.956 --> 28:24.915
Oh, yeah.

28:39.476 --> 28:42.035
Are you OK? I didn't...

28:42.036 --> 28:43.915
I didn't wanna do any damage
down there.

28:43.916 --> 28:45.435
That's good.
Yeah?

28:45.436 --> 28:46.995
It's fine.
Finlay.

28:46.996 --> 28:48.995
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are
you doing?

28:48.996 --> 28:50.475
We've got major problems, mate.

28:50.476 --> 28:52.036
Can't it wait?
It can't bleedin' wait!

28:52.037 --> 28:54.477
I've had to wait for you
to ejaculate. What more d'you want?

28:54.478 --> 28:55.955
You get your shit together, right?

28:55.956 --> 28:59.955
Finlay!

29:01.076 --> 29:02.235
What kind of rabbit?

29:02.236 --> 29:04.915
I don't know what kind of fucking
rabbit. They're all the same.

29:04.916 --> 29:06.435
Well, actually, they're not.

29:06.436 --> 29:09.555
You've got the lop-eared,
the American lop-eared,

29:09.556 --> 29:10.915
the French Angora...

29:10.916 --> 29:12.995
Just shut up. Shh, shh. Be quiet.

29:12.996 --> 29:15.355
It's... It is a psycho rabbit

29:15.356 --> 29:18.795
and he's wearing a suit
and it's got a golf club.

29:18.796 --> 29:21.635
That's all I know.
Right, OK.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.035
Did it have a silky coat?

29:23.036 --> 29:25.435
Just shut up! Shut up about
the rabbit.

29:25.436 --> 29:27.395
Seriously, man, be quiet.

29:27.396 --> 29:29.555
Fuck!

29:29.556 --> 29:31.235
We've gotta find the others.

29:31.236 --> 29:33.515
All right. No... No, I'm gonna have
to tool up.

29:33.516 --> 29:35.635
Gonna have to...

29:38.436 --> 29:40.075
Just gonna put 'em like that.

29:40.076 --> 29:41.275
See?

29:41.276 --> 29:44.595
Another one through there.
Pshhew! Ah! Let's do it.

29:44.596 --> 29:46.915
Hang on, I want one!
Come... Come on, mate.

29:46.916 --> 29:50.475
Honest to God, do not have time for
this sort of shenanigary, do we?

29:50.476 --> 29:54.475
If I could just get my finger under
there, it wouldn't be so bad, but...

29:54.796 --> 29:57.835
I can't get it off, mate. You'll be
all right. You'll be all right.

29:57.836 --> 29:59.515
You'll be all right.
Fuck!

29:59.516 --> 30:01.035
Sorry, but I need to ask...

30:01.036 --> 30:02.835
Why have you got a "2" on your head?

30:02.836 --> 30:05.755
What, you've never seen a girl
with a number drawn on her head?

30:05.756 --> 30:08.475
It's a fashion thing, you
should try it. You think so?

30:08.476 --> 30:10.875
You could definitely carry off
a number,

30:10.876 --> 30:13.755
something like... a...

30:13.756 --> 30:14.955
7?

30:14.956 --> 30:16.595
Maybe a 9.

30:16.596 --> 30:18.755
Jess, can I talk to you?
Not now.

30:18.756 --> 30:21.235
There's something I need to
tell you.Fine, go ahead.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.955
Can we go somewhere a bit more quiet?

30:22.956 --> 30:24.435
Why?

30:24.436 --> 30:28.435
So you can just fuck me about and
drop me when you feel like it?

30:30.236 --> 30:33.195
Um...

30:33.196 --> 30:34.475
See you later.

30:34.476 --> 30:37.635
Mmm.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.755
Great. Thanks!

30:39.756 --> 30:41.115
So let me guess.

30:41.116 --> 30:43.915
You don't want me but no-one else can
have me either?

30:43.916 --> 30:47.915
I had you so wrong. I thought you
were this lovely, genuine guy.

30:48.796 --> 30:52.795
You're just like all the others.

31:03.516 --> 31:05.715
Hey.

31:05.716 --> 31:07.075
You're OK!

31:07.076 --> 31:09.155
Why wouldn't I be?

31:09.156 --> 31:12.035
You were kind of out of it. We... We
found you out in the hallway.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.315
Right.

31:14.316 --> 31:16.075
You the one that put me in the toilet?

31:16.076 --> 31:18.475
Yeah, I-I... I felt bad just leaving
you there like that.

31:18.476 --> 31:21.715
Didn't touch me up or anything while
you were moving me?

31:21.716 --> 31:22.835
Bit of the old side boob?

31:22.836 --> 31:23.635
No. God, no. No.

31:23.636 --> 31:25.995
Then why are my knickers on inside out?

31:25.996 --> 31:29.115
You...! I-I-I didn't do anything.
I didn't.

31:29.116 --> 31:31.115
Tell that to the judge.

31:31.116 --> 31:35.115
- Oh, Finlay!
- Oh, my God.I never...

31:37.196 --> 31:38.675
I'm joking.

31:39.916 --> 31:41.955
Hey! No.

31:41.956 --> 31:43.755
No, th... Thanks a lot.

31:43.756 --> 31:45.995
Anyway, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

31:45.996 --> 31:47.595
Yeah. Have a good night.

31:47.596 --> 31:50.435
Nice one. Hey, come on, drink up.
We're goin'.

31:50.436 --> 31:51.675
Why?

31:51.676 --> 31:54.595
Because there's a giant white rabbit
out there who's wearing a suit,

31:54.596 --> 31:57.275
he's got a golf club, and he's...
goin' round killing people.

31:57.276 --> 31:59.515
What rabbit?
What is wrong wi' you both?

31:59.516 --> 32:00.915
It's just a fucking rabbit!

32:00.916 --> 32:02.635
I told you. Fuck me!

32:02.636 --> 32:05.195
I told you he was out there.
Told me what? The white rabbit.

32:05.196 --> 32:07.555
I said he was coming for us.

32:07.556 --> 32:10.075
Richard, did you do this?
Is this your rabbit, mate?

32:10.076 --> 32:12.835
I hadn't done any in a while.
I didn't think

32:12.836 --> 32:14.635
it was gonna happen again.

32:14.636 --> 32:17.555
Done what? The storm.

32:17.556 --> 32:19.235
I dropped some acid and it got bad.

32:19.236 --> 32:21.555
It got really fucking bad.

32:21.556 --> 32:23.395
Mate, did you shit yourself?

32:23.396 --> 32:26.955
This hallucination...

32:26.956 --> 32:29.835
Shat himself. The white rabbit,
it's become real.

32:29.836 --> 32:32.386
Hang on a minute. You've
taken acid, there's a giant

32:32.387 --> 32:34.935
white rabbit wi' a golf club,
no-one's shat'emselves.

32:34.985 --> 32:36.024
That's good.

32:36.025 --> 32:38.044
We need to find Jess.
I thought she was with you.

32:38.126 --> 32:39.445
She stormed off.

32:39.446 --> 32:42.605
She... Well, we need to find
her.

32:42.606 --> 32:46.605
Oh, fuck!

33:00.566 --> 33:03.765
She's not in the bathroom. Listen,
she's bloody gone 'ome.

33:03.766 --> 33:05.685
She'll be on t'couch, curled up,
Maltesers,

33:05.686 --> 33:06.925
watching a film about boys.

33:06.926 --> 33:09.046
- Look, we need to find her.
- You need to find her.

33:09.047 --> 33:11.525
This is your fault.How?
She was with you, then we come back

33:11.526 --> 33:13.365
and she's gone, so what happened?

33:13.404 --> 33:14.443
Nothing happened.

33:14.444 --> 33:17.204
Look, just stop. Me and Finn will
go and have a look at the funeral.

33:17.205 --> 33:18.803
Just ask around, man.

33:18.804 --> 33:21.044
Fine, but if we're going out
there, I want me own keys.

33:21.045 --> 33:24.401
Really?! Fuck!

33:26.122 --> 33:30.121
Oh!

35:16.162 --> 35:20.161
Ah, fuck.

35:23.002 --> 35:24.521
Hi.

35:24.522 --> 35:25.761
It's me.

35:25.762 --> 35:27.681
You haven't seen me friend,
have you? She...

35:27.682 --> 35:29.201
Sorry, do I know you?

35:29.202 --> 35:32.921
Oh, right, I...

35:32.922 --> 35:36.921
I thought you were someone else.

35:37.082 --> 35:38.881
Sorry. She's not here.

35:38.882 --> 35:40.881
She's not here. No, I know.

35:43.722 --> 35:46.441
There's a rabbit out there,
a fucking big one,

35:46.442 --> 35:50.441
and he's got this girl...

35:58.762 --> 36:00.201
- Oi!
- Who did that?!

36:00.202 --> 36:03.161
What you fuckin' doing, man?
OK...

36:03.162 --> 36:04.681
Um...

36:04.682 --> 36:07.001
Sorry to break up this whole
party thing,

36:07.002 --> 36:10.921
but I think I have something
quite important to say.

36:10.922 --> 36:14.881
There's a white rabbit out there and
he's fucking weird and...

36:14.882 --> 36:18.561
he's got this girl and she's
unconscious, and I feel like maybe

36:18.562 --> 36:20.881
we should be doing something.
What does she look like?

36:20.882 --> 36:22.761
You saw it too?
Where did he take her?

36:22.762 --> 36:24.561
He dragged her into the lift.

36:24.562 --> 36:28.561
She was bleeding.
It looked pretty scary.

36:30.882 --> 36:32.921
What the fuck's wrong with this thing?

36:32.922 --> 36:34.641
Calm down, I'm sure she's OK.

36:34.642 --> 36:38.281
I dunno, mate. She looked
in a pretty bad way.

36:40.802 --> 36:43.001
Hang... Hang on!
Whoa, whoa.

36:43.002 --> 36:47.001
Just stop, hang on. Hang on. We don't
even know where he's taken her, do we?

36:47.402 --> 36:50.761
Eh?

36:50.762 --> 36:53.401
Oh, she's in the fucking basement.

36:53.402 --> 36:55.496
Brilliant.

37:04.306 --> 37:07.025
Where you...? Hey, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:07.026 --> 37:09.985
You stay here, little lady.
This is absolutely no place...

37:10.065 --> 37:11.704
Man's work.

37:11.705 --> 37:15.704
It's dangerous.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.224
Right. Right, listen, right?
Listen.

37:36.225 --> 37:39.304
You're going to have to go down
that way, we'll go down this way.

37:39.305 --> 37:41.704
Why do I have to go on my own?

37:41.705 --> 37:45.704
Because you're bigger than us.

37:46.505 --> 37:50.504
Yes, he is bigger.

38:32.425 --> 38:34.944
We need to get her out of here.

38:35.027 --> 38:36.626
Rudy.

38:36.627 --> 38:40.626
Oh, fuck.

39:25.507 --> 39:28.826
I'm Abbey, by the way.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.947
So, are we all going to go on
somewhere for a drink?

39:30.948 --> 39:34.626
Cos this rabbit-slaying's
thirsty work.

39:47.227 --> 39:48.946
So, here he is.

39:48.947 --> 39:52.066
Richard Saunders, honestly,
what a complete cock-sucker.

39:52.067 --> 39:56.066
I fuckin' hate people
who can't handle their drugs.

39:59.267 --> 40:00.426
Shit party, by the way.

40:00.427 --> 40:01.546
Really shit.

40:01.547 --> 40:03.386
And next time,
buy some fucking nibbles.

40:03.387 --> 40:07.386
Mmm!

40:26.867 --> 40:30.586
I can't stop thinking about her.

40:30.587 --> 40:34.586
I'm never going to see her again.

40:34.627 --> 40:38.626
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

40:41.107 --> 40:45.106
Yeah, you're right.

40:45.747 --> 40:49.466
No. Ac... No, sorry, no. That's
just... I think that's bullshit.

40:49.467 --> 40:51.866
I think that's just something
people say

40:51.867 --> 40:55.866
when they can't think of anything else.

40:56.867 --> 40:59.746
I shouldn't have done it.

40:59.747 --> 41:02.986
I was only trying to make her
jealous and she didn't even notice.

41:02.987 --> 41:05.186
Huh!

41:05.187 --> 41:09.186
When d'you think it'll come off?

41:09.547 --> 41:12.026
Soon.

41:13.227 --> 41:17.226
Soon... probably.

41:40.907 --> 41:42.626
What's going on with us?

41:42.627 --> 41:45.626
Hmm?

41:45.627 --> 41:49.626
We need to talk,
because I'm really confused.

41:56.907 --> 42:00.906
What are you doing?

42:05.227 --> 42:09.106
I wanted to tell you.

42:09.107 --> 42:13.106
But I didn't think you'd understand.

42:18.747 --> 42:21.626
What happened?

42:21.627 --> 42:22.826
Is that...?

42:22.827 --> 42:25.506
Were you born like that?

42:25.507 --> 42:28.066
I was in a club.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.906
Someone stole it from me.

42:29.907 --> 42:30.826
They... They stole it?

42:30.827 --> 42:31.866
Yeah, it was a girl.

42:31.867 --> 42:33.826
A bloke.

42:33.827 --> 42:36.946
A transgender bloke.

42:36.947 --> 42:38.826
She wanted to be a man.

42:38.827 --> 42:41.226
She had a power.

42:41.227 --> 42:44.066
So she... took it from me.
We... We swapped.

42:44.067 --> 42:45.346
Holy shit!

42:45.347 --> 42:49.346
My cock is out there somewhere.

42:50.147 --> 42:52.866
It's mine.

42:52.867 --> 42:56.866
And I'm going to get it back.

42:57.947 --> 43:01.946
So now you know...

43:01.947 --> 43:05.946
why we can't be together.

43:29.227 --> 43:30.826
I'll double your money.

43:30.827 --> 43:32.666
Whatever it takes.

43:32.667 --> 43:34.506
Just find my cock.

43:34.507 --> 43:35.586
Now, then.

43:35.587 --> 43:38.026
Passed-out girl on the floor,
good-looking girl.

43:38.027 --> 43:39.226
Hello.

43:39.227 --> 43:42.226
- Are you on community service?
- No. Just pretending.

43:42.227 --> 43:43.546
You're not on the system.

43:43.547 --> 43:47.546
And if you're not on the
system then you don't exist.

43:47.707 --> 43:49.306
I know who's got your cock.

43:49.307 --> 43:51.226
There's half.

43:51.227 --> 43:53.386
You get the rest when I get it back.

43:53.387 --> 43:56.826
Hi, Rudy.

43:56.827 --> 43:58.066
What are you doing here?

43:58.067 --> 43:59.586
I came to see you.

43:59.587 --> 44:01.266
I'm not the caretaker.

44:01.267 --> 44:04.826
I just told you that cos I didn't
want you to know the truth, really.

44:04.827 --> 44:06.866
It's not for me to judge you.

44:06.867 --> 44:07.906
How did it go?

44:07.907 --> 44:09.746
It was amazing,
and then she's ran away.

44:09.747 --> 44:11.146
Again.

44:11.147 --> 44:15.146
Maybe she's a sexy, psycho werewolf
who doesn't want you finding out.

44:26.307 --> 44:29.146
What are you doing?

44:29.147 --> 44:30.632
Get it out. I want to see it.

44:30.660 --> 44:38.660
