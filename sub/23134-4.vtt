that many countries still
have a long way

00:15.616 --> 00:18.286

for LGBTQ rights.

Don't let down your hopes.
And nearly everything

00:20.421 --> 00:22.556

has made us think of home.

what two-spirit means?

Mm.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.888

and so we coined that word

01:27.921 --> 01:30.824
as an umbrella
for all our tribes.

you're transgender.

You're lesbian."

that say things like,
"This is a Western construct.

So maybe tell us more
about your studies on sexuality.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.583
One of the studies was,

07:29.617 --> 07:31.952
how many men
in the United States are gay?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.622
As the surveys tell us,
only about 1 percent or --

07:34.655 --> 07:36.123
of -- of men are homosexual.
Mm.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.925
And it's clear from the data

07:37.958 --> 07:40.060
that it's more in the range
of about 5 percent.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.829
So what does this suggest?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.797
This suggests a lot of men
in the least tolerant parts

07:43.831 --> 07:45.733
of the country
are in the closet.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.101

at pornographic search data.

that only about 1 percent

07:50.571 --> 07:52.606

are gay in Mississippi?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.074

07:54.107 --> 07:56.910
of pornographic searches
are for gay male porn.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.748
We can also look at what men
search right after gay porn.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.015
Mm-hmm.

common searches,

08:03.283 --> 08:04.652
particularly in
intolerant states,

08:04.685 --> 08:05.986
is "gay test."

through the mind set of a guy

08:07.621 --> 08:09.590

and then ra--

08:09.623 --> 08:10.991

By far, it's,
"Is my husband gay?"

about 80 percent

what the mood

09:51.659 --> 09:53.260

09:58.131 --> 09:59.733
Hey, Ian.
Hey.

How's it going down there?
We're in Iowa.

PAGE: In the ramp-up to the 2016
presidential election,

10:05.172 --> 10:08.208
Iowa is a battleground
for votes and the first place

10:08.241 --> 10:11.211
to hear the candidates
on the soapbox.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.914
We're here to talk with one
of the country's most prominent

10:13.947 --> 10:16.349
conservative critics
of gay rights,

10:16.383 --> 10:19.019
Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.855
So we're gonna try and have
some form of interaction

10:21.889 --> 10:25.125
with him, but we'll see.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.360
So sorry.
So how this is...

10:27.394 --> 10:29.062
Thank you.
High school kids...

Hi.
Hi.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.167
We're just exploring
the options, yes.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.403
You made a decision?
Uh, no.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.005
Not yet.
No.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.808
PAGE: What is appealing
about Ted Cruz for you guys?

10:42.810 --> 10:45.345
Yeah. In what sense
do you feel you are?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.120
BOTH: Right, right.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.094

Okay. Watch out, watch out.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.898
Thank you very much.

state of Iowa.

PAGE: Here's a quick primer

11:10.904 --> 11:13.874
on Senator Cruz's position
on queer rights:

11:13.907 --> 11:15.342
He opposes marriage equality...

11:15.375 --> 11:18.912
I have been proud
to defend traditional marriage

11:18.946 --> 11:21.915
as the union of one man
and one woman my entire life.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.917
PAGE: He has urged states
and individuals

11:23.951 --> 11:25.753
to ignore the court's ruling.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.989
He voted against workplace
protections for queer Americans.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.924
He supports those
who deny services

11:30.958 --> 11:32.459
to the LGBTQ community

11:32.492 --> 11:35.028
on the basis
of religious liberty.

11:35.062 --> 11:39.066
And most recently, he campaigned
alongside Kevin Swanson,

11:39.099 --> 11:42.335
a pastor who preaches
on the execution of homosexuals.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.838
Romans chapter one verse 32,
the Apostle Paul

11:44.872 --> 11:46.439
does say

11:46.473 --> 11:49.042
that homosexuals

11:49.076 --> 11:51.278
are worthy of death.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.346
PAGE: And among Republicans,

11:53.380 --> 11:55.816
he's a top choice
for our next president.

Thank you!
And God bless you!

PAGE: I thought he was
gonna answer questions.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.425
Probably shouldn't talk.

Christian musical group

They tour the country
as an expression of their faith.

12:26.513 --> 12:30.884
So it'll be interesting
to hear their perspective.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.485
DANIEL: You have many more
family members,

12:32.519 --> 12:33.887
but they're all sleeping?
That's right.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.188
Over here?
Sleeping or resting or s--

12:35.222 --> 12:37.124
some of the sort, yes.
We have 10 children.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.959
We're farm folks.
We have a farm...

12:38.992 --> 12:40.493
Yeah.
And spend about 6 months

12:40.527 --> 12:42.863
of the year on the farm and the
other 6 months on the road,

12:42.896 --> 12:44.331
touring with our music.
Awesome.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.966
Awesome.
So...

12:45.999 --> 12:47.367
Are you homeschooled?
Is that how that works?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.036
Road schooled.
Road schooled.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.871
Well-said.
Bus schooled.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.439
Wherever.
Yeah.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.174
But, I mean, uh, clearly,
we're here because I think

12:54.207 --> 12:55.943
it just seems like people
are really passionate

12:55.976 --> 12:57.377
about religious liberty.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.879
And there are people
that are really passionate

12:58.912 --> 13:00.347
about LGBT issues.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.015
I mean, I'm just kind
of wondering your opinion

13:02.049 --> 13:04.084
about how those two things
exist in our country

13:04.117 --> 13:05.485
and, like, what...
I-is there a battle

13:05.518 --> 13:07.520
between the two?
There is a bit of a battle.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.422
But I think the media
plays a lot of that up.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.559
Okay?
A hundred years ago in our U.S.,

13:12.592 --> 13:14.361
this issue wasn't a big issue.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.230
And as a country,
my feeling is,

13:17.264 --> 13:18.866
is farther we
drift away from God,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.567
the more this has crept in.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.235
Sure.
I -- I think a lot of people

13:22.269 --> 13:24.905
would say about why it seems
like there's gay people

13:24.938 --> 13:27.307
more now is because,
you know, back 50,

13:27.340 --> 13:30.177
100 years ago, it -- you know,
they were so persecuted,

13:30.210 --> 13:33.413
so it was hard to live openly.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.282
Yeah. I think -- I think,
overall, you know,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.050
you look at the Bible.
And it talks about,

13:37.084 --> 13:38.852
like, the issue
that you're talking about, um,

13:38.886 --> 13:40.854
in that way as being unnatural.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.222
God didn't create us like that.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.424
I think that's what a lot
of people misunderstand.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.626
God created everything perfect.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.896
We're the ones
that messed it up.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.630
Here's the thing
I think, you know,

13:50.663 --> 13:53.466
I believe people
are born gay, right?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.937
And I want you guys to be able
to believe whatever you want.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.406
But it makes me sad
when I sit here

13:59.439 --> 14:03.911
as a gay person and I know
that you think I'm unnatural.

14:03.944 --> 14:07.114
And what that does
is it creates a climate

14:07.147 --> 14:09.349
that is, I think,

14:09.382 --> 14:11.651
really hard for
young gay kids to grow up

14:11.684 --> 14:15.155
in because they're being told,
"You're just not the same.

14:15.188 --> 14:19.059
And, in fact, you're not --
you're not equal."

14:19.092 --> 14:22.429
There's so much despair,
I -- I know that -

14:22.462 --> 14:24.064
in that whole community,

14:24.097 --> 14:26.633
in your homosexual community
that you're talking about.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.469
I don't see peace or happiness
or joy.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.504
Mm.
And I don't believe it's

14:31.538 --> 14:35.442
because they can't get married
in this certain church.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.977
I think it's
because they're not living

14:37.010 --> 14:38.345
according to God's plan.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.980
I'm just trying to --

14:40.013 --> 14:41.248
to understand the religious
perspective

14:41.281 --> 14:43.150
on, if you ever
had a transgender person

14:43.183 --> 14:45.919
or a gay person in your family,
have you thought about what --

14:45.953 --> 14:48.021
what would happen or what --

14:48.055 --> 14:50.123
what you would do
in that situation?

14:50.157 --> 14:52.125
Well, no, I haven't thought
about it a lot.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.061
I'll be honest with ya.

14:54.094 --> 14:57.530
I guess I would take him back
to the scripture.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.332
If they follow the Bible

14:59.366 --> 15:01.634
and believe what the Bible says,
I don't think it'll be an issue.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.670
Mm-hmm.
You know, I believe,

15:03.703 --> 15:05.973
in America, you should be able
to believe whatever you want.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.142
But in our culture today,
we've gone and said, you know,

15:09.176 --> 15:10.543
"We don't need
the Bible anymore."

15:10.577 --> 15:12.279
Well, then, let's say
there's a 20-year-old guy

15:12.312 --> 15:14.014
who falls in love
with a 10-year-old girl and...

15:14.047 --> 15:15.615
Or a dog.
Or -- or a dog or a cat.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.150
And -- and the thing
about the 10-year-old girl...

15:17.184 --> 15:18.551
Well, that would be rape.
That's...

15:18.585 --> 15:20.053
But who said...
That's what our law defines.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.989
Yeah, to compare
a dog to...

15:22.022 --> 15:23.690
The same thing.
Gay people getting married...

15:23.723 --> 15:25.158
Well, I'm not saying
it's the same thing.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.326
What I'm saying is...
It... You are --

15:26.359 --> 15:28.161
you are, in one...

15:28.195 --> 15:29.396
Okay.
Fell swoop...

15:29.429 --> 15:31.031
But it does kinda...
Comparing the two.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.565
I'm just saying...
It does kinda go down that path.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.367
Yeah.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.141
PAGE:
As hard as that was to hear,

15:41.174 --> 15:43.710
they're ultimately entitled
to their beliefs,

15:43.743 --> 15:47.514
but turning those beliefs
into laws is a different matter.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.349
That's exactly
what's motivating us

15:49.382 --> 15:53.120
to talk to Senator Cruz today.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.089
We're on the search
for Ted Cruz right now.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.959
We found him?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.499
Is there a line?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.468
Where are we going, Ellen?
Uh, we're going...

16:08.501 --> 16:11.238
Ted Cruz is, like, getting
some pork or something.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.607
So we're gonna go try
and talk to him.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.476
Sorry.
Where are you going, ma'am?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.045
This is a food line.
Um, yeah.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.513
I'm going with these guys
to talk to Ted Cruz.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.254
He's gonna be right here.
Excuse me.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.625
MAN: Pork burgers.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.626
Sena... How's
the pork, Senator?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.694
Huh?
Is it good?

16:34.727 --> 16:35.728
Oh, it's fabulous.
Yeah?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.364
Awesome.
It's...

16:37.397 --> 16:39.166
I highly recommend it.
This is the place to be?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.633
Uh, can we a -- can we
ask you questions right now?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.602
It's -- it's incredible.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.474
Thank you for having me here.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.044
Uh, hey --

17:01.421 --> 17:05.192
PAGE: Religious liberty laws
have been key in the backlash

17:05.225 --> 17:08.128
to the Supreme Court's
marriage-equality decision.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.198
And now, I'm gonna ask Senator
Cruz about his position on them.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.500
Uh, hey.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.135
Hey, Senator.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.369
I was wondering
if I could ask you a question

17:16.403 --> 17:17.637
about the religious
liberty rally.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.672
Yeah.
Um, I think, uh,

17:19.706 --> 17:21.541
a lot of people, particularly,

17:21.574 --> 17:23.643
like, in the LGBT community,

17:23.676 --> 17:25.545
are worried just 'cause,
in the past,

17:25.578 --> 17:27.114
during Segregation Era

17:27.147 --> 17:29.382
or when women were trying to,

17:29.416 --> 17:32.152
you know, get the right to vote,

17:32.185 --> 17:35.155
religious liberty
was often used to defend

17:35.188 --> 17:36.689
and justify that discrimination.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.459
So a lot of people
in the LGBT community

17:39.492 --> 17:42.262
just have this fear due
to the past examples

17:42.295 --> 17:43.696
that that's what's gonna happen.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.565
So I was wondering
if you could speak to that.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.567
Well, you know, it's interesting
you bring up that example.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.702
If you actually look
at the history in this country

17:49.736 --> 17:51.304
of defeating slavery...
Mm-hmm.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.306
You look at the history
of defeating Jim Crow...

17:53.340 --> 17:54.574
Mm-hmm.
It was leaders in the church

17:54.607 --> 17:56.276
that played a critical role.
Yeah.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.445
But a lot of religious people
also used the Bible

17:58.478 --> 18:01.414
to defend segregation,
to defend slavery.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.483
So all I'm...
So I'm just saying,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.885
like, I think religious
freedom's so important.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.855
It's so crucial
for all religions.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.557
LGBT people are worried

18:10.590 --> 18:12.692
that they will directly
be discriminated against.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.427
And, you know...
But -- but we don't have a right

18:14.461 --> 18:16.496
to force anyone
to abandon their faith.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.331
It is one
of the foundational commitments

18:18.365 --> 18:19.532
of who we are as Americans

18:19.566 --> 18:21.134
to respect diversity.
Sure.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.602
But for example, still,
in a lot of states,

18:22.635 --> 18:25.538
LGBT people can be fired
for just being gay

18:25.572 --> 18:27.440
or for just being trans.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.176
Um, that's totally legal.
I mean,

18:29.209 --> 18:30.510
how do you feel about that?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.212
That just doesn't sound
very American to me.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.747
Well, we're saying
Bible-believing

18:34.781 --> 18:36.216
Christians are being persecuted.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.684
So for example,
one of the couples...

18:37.717 --> 18:39.452
Yeah, for discriminating
against LGBT people.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.221
No, for living according
to their faith.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.455
So for example...
Yeah, but you...

18:42.489 --> 18:43.623
People would've
used that argument

18:43.656 --> 18:45.292
in Segregation Era.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.526

27:41.928 --> 27:45.464
However, today, violence
directed at the queer community

27:45.497 --> 27:47.834
is still a nationwide problem.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.904
And transgender women of color
face the most brutality,

27:51.938 --> 27:56.909
with an average life expectancy
of only 35 years.

27:56.943 --> 28:01.380
This is one of the biggest civil
rights issues of our generation.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.716
WOMAN: I am disappointed
in my community,

28:03.750 --> 28:05.451
as a queer black woman,

28:05.484 --> 28:07.787
with the nonresponse

28:07.820 --> 28:11.290
to our black trans sisters
being murdered out here.

to meet with

28:15.862 --> 28:17.163
Miss Major Griffin-Gracy,

28:17.196 --> 28:19.999
a trans activist
for the last 40 years.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.801
GRACY: We're here.
And we're not going nowhere.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.937
I am not going down
without a goddamn fight.

28:26.839 --> 28:30.209
PAGE: She was one of the leaders
of the Stonewall riots

28:30.242 --> 28:33.946
and has been key in advancing
the struggle of trans Americans

28:33.980 --> 28:38.084
within the broader
gay rights movement.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.485
DANIEL: Thanks for having us.
Sure. No problem.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.821
We really appreciate meeting you
and being here.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.289
What do you feel are sort
of the next steps

28:43.322 --> 28:45.491
or the next moves
that should be taken?

28:45.524 --> 28:47.126
Reading about it

28:47.159 --> 28:49.461
and hearing it in the media
is really nice.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.530
But they're not taking it
to heart.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.465
Yes, we've gotten
more visibility now.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.168
Well, that's nice.
But that doesn't make it safer.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.970
So I worry every time I go out

28:58.004 --> 29:01.207
that someone is gonna run up
behind me, hit me in my head...

29:01.240 --> 29:03.810
Mm-hmm.
And I'm not gonna make it home.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.212
And to have to live your life
like that every day,

29:06.245 --> 29:09.215
24 hours a day, every time
you step out your house,

29:09.248 --> 29:10.516
it's hard.
Mm-hmm.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.318
And how would you compare
the climate now

29:12.351 --> 29:13.886
to the climate in --

29:13.920 --> 29:17.423
in the '60s, when your,
you know, activism began?

29:17.456 --> 29:19.225
You know, at that time,

29:19.258 --> 29:21.427
you couldn't go out
till it was after dark.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.863
Uh, the bars
that you were able to go to,

29:23.896 --> 29:25.898
you would use the back door

29:25.932 --> 29:27.900
so that no one would see you
go in the front door

29:27.934 --> 29:29.368
to know that you were in there.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.403
It's better today
than it used to be.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.439
But it's not
where it should be, you know?

29:33.472 --> 29:36.108
That a majority
of us are still struggling,

29:36.142 --> 29:38.010
still going
in and out of prison.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.411
We're a small community.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.013
And all we've got is each other.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.448
Yeah.
You know?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.183
And if we don't care
about each other, no one else

29:44.216 --> 29:47.119
is gonna give a damn about us
one way or the other.

29:47.153 --> 29:51.157
You have to create a nice,
safe social network, you know?

29:51.190 --> 29:53.425
Like, for me,
some of the girls call me Mom.

29:53.459 --> 29:54.894
Some call me Grandma.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.964
So we've created
our own sense of family.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.566
And so the fight continues.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.969
That's all I know to do,
is to keep fighting.

30:05.637 --> 30:10.276
Well, Miss Major has helped
and supported and saved,

30:10.309 --> 30:12.945
you know, countless lives.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.081
And I'm humbled
by the individual,

30:15.114 --> 30:16.348
face-to-face activism

30:16.382 --> 30:19.285
she does by supporting
other trans women.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.920
And what an amazing thing.

30:27.894 --> 30:31.097
PAGE: Since 1999,
the St. James Infirmary

30:31.130 --> 30:33.599
has offered
free health and social services

30:33.632 --> 30:35.201
for the trans community

30:35.234 --> 30:37.469
and is the only clinic
in the country run

30:37.503 --> 30:40.172
by and for sex workers.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.474
We are meeting
with Star Amerasu,

30:42.508 --> 30:44.476
who is helping
to protect the community

30:44.510 --> 30:46.345
with a bad-date list.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.880
Hey.
Hi.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.016
What's up?
So the bad-date list,

30:50.049 --> 30:51.417
these people are
perpetrators of violence.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.552
They're doing sexual assault,
robbery,

30:53.585 --> 30:55.487
all these different things
to sex workers.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.957
And we wanna be able
to collect that information

30:57.990 --> 30:59.525
and spread them
around the community

30:59.558 --> 31:02.394
so that we can sort of,
like, protect each other.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.230
Are you from here
originally, Star?

31:04.263 --> 31:07.266
So, I moved here
from Austin, Texas.

31:07.299 --> 31:08.634
Oh, cool.
Like, you know, San Francisco's,

31:08.667 --> 31:10.402
like, the trans Mecca...

31:10.436 --> 31:12.004
Mm-hmm.
Of America.

31:12.038 --> 31:15.341
Um, I, like, moved here
specifically to transition.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.043
Mm.
Mm.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.245
And so do you feel really
supported in San Francisco?

31:19.278 --> 31:20.679
I do.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.049
You know, there's a lot
of access to health care here

31:23.082 --> 31:24.283
for trans people.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.452
And so I was able to have,

31:26.485 --> 31:27.987
um, hormone therapy.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.488
I was able to have surgery.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.223
And all of these things
were paid for by the city.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.458
Mm.
We have all this access

31:32.491 --> 31:33.492
to this care.

31:33.525 --> 31:34.927
But at the same time, like,

31:34.961 --> 31:36.695
transgender people
can't get jobs.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.130
Mm.
Mm-hmm.
Transgender people

31:38.164 --> 31:39.398
are having a hard time
finding housing.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.933
Mm.
And so then, what kind of work

31:40.967 --> 31:42.234
are you gonna do?
You're gonna do sex work.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.136
And then, sex work
is criminalized, right?

31:44.170 --> 31:45.537
Mm-hmm.
And they're going

31:45.571 --> 31:49.541
after these specifically black
and Latina trans women

31:49.575 --> 31:51.410
who are working
the streets, right?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.045
And then,
when they get arrested,

31:53.079 --> 31:54.546
they don't go to women's prison.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.448
They get sent to men's prisons.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.450
This shouldn't be happening
to our people.

31:58.484 --> 32:01.387
We need to protect the most
vulnerable group

32:01.420 --> 32:03.122
of people in America right now,

32:03.155 --> 32:05.257
which is black trans
women need to be protected.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.725
Mm-hmm.
I think it would help

32:06.758 --> 32:08.961
to put in perspective
some of the discrimination

32:08.995 --> 32:10.429
that you face and especially

32:10.462 --> 32:13.299
when we're looking at stats
like the life expectancy

32:13.332 --> 32:15.501
is 35 years
for trans women of color.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.170
What are some of the things
that lead to that?

32:18.204 --> 32:21.307
I think it has to do with
an internalized transphobia.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.210
If you look at those murders,
they were all done by men

32:24.243 --> 32:25.711
who may or may not have been

32:25.744 --> 32:28.314
in a relationship with the woman
that they killed.

32:28.347 --> 32:31.050
There's a defense that people
use, trans-panic defense,

32:31.083 --> 32:32.451
or, like, gay-panic defense...
Mm-hmm.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.386
Where it's like, "Oh,
I didn't know she was trans.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.422
And when I found out
she was trans, I blacked out.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.656
And I fucking killed her,"

32:37.689 --> 32:39.225
which is really
fucked up, like...

32:39.258 --> 32:41.660
Yeah.
That people can use that defense

32:41.693 --> 32:43.562
to get away with murder.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.597
I'm at the most vulnerable point

32:45.631 --> 32:48.300
right now in my life
as a trans woman

32:48.334 --> 32:51.737
because I am young
and attractive.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.372
And that is the people
that are dying.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.407
Like, all these girls,
if you look through the pictures

32:55.441 --> 32:57.509
of all these women
that were murdered, none...

32:57.543 --> 32:59.378
You could never say
that any of these women

32:59.411 --> 33:01.080
weren't beautiful.
Mm-hmm.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.481
And there's something
about this beauty

33:02.514 --> 33:04.783
that these people
want to get rid of.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.753
And that has to end,
because the world

33:07.786 --> 33:10.356
is gonna lose some
if its vibrancy with us gone.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.559
Mm-hmm.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.095
PAGE:
In 2015, the United States

33:16.128 --> 33:18.530
saw more murders
of transgender people

33:18.564 --> 33:20.766
than ever in recorded history.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.368
And recently,

33:22.401 --> 33:25.804
another young woman
was tragically lost.

33:25.837 --> 33:31.677
Taja DeJesus, a prominent member
of the community, was murdered.

We're meeting with Taja's mother

33:33.312 --> 33:35.181
and sister to hear more
about the woman

33:35.214 --> 33:38.517
they loved and lost too soon.

DANIEL: If you could tell us
about her childhood

33:41.253 --> 33:43.522
and just kind of start
at the beginning...

33:43.555 --> 33:44.823
Who she was like as a person?
Kind of, yeah.

33:44.856 --> 33:48.627
Yeah.
When she was about 3 years old,

33:48.660 --> 33:50.062
she asked me,

33:50.096 --> 33:52.398
"When am I gonna grow up
to be a girl?"

33:52.431 --> 33:56.135
Hmm.
I never even heard
of the word transgender.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.270
My family, we didn't talk
about that.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.206
Mm-hmm.
You know, and everything

34:00.239 --> 34:02.741
that was different was a sin.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.577
We were all very protective
of her.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.479
Mm.
But we couldn't keep her

34:07.513 --> 34:08.647
in our little bubble.

34:08.680 --> 34:12.451
And...
[ Breath catches ]

34:12.484 --> 34:17.189
Sad to say,
my worst fear came true.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.161
I woke up.
And I had, like, a --

34:22.194 --> 34:24.696
a weird feeling.

34:24.730 --> 34:28.167
And then, I called her up.
And I can't get ahold of Taja.

34:28.200 --> 34:32.271
You know? And this is Sunday,
then Monday.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.706
And then, Tuesday,
my phone rang.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.575
And it was the medical examiner.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.210
And he said,

34:38.244 --> 34:41.680
"Your daughter Taja
passed away."

34:41.713 --> 34:44.183
And I said, "You know,

34:44.216 --> 34:47.186
my daughter suffered
through her life.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.587
She did.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.223
And I just want to know
that she didn't suffer."

34:51.257 --> 34:53.325
And he said, "I'm sorry.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.894
I can't tell you that.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.665
Your daughter was a victim
of a fatal homicide."

34:59.698 --> 35:01.233
Hmm.
And it was like,

35:01.267 --> 35:02.668
every place we called,

35:02.701 --> 35:05.337
they didn't have
any information.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.573
They couldn't tell us anything.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.808
No law enforcement
reached out to you whatsoever?

35:09.841 --> 35:11.577
No.
We went to the police station.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.479
We went to the closest
police station.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.182
And we picked up a police...
And there was a blurb.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.616
Blotter: 36-year old...
Male.

35:17.649 --> 35:21.520
Male found stabbed to death
in the stairwell.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.556
And it was her address.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.358
Taja was in a relationship

35:26.392 --> 35:29.695
with someone who didn't
want anyone to know...

35:29.728 --> 35:31.497
Mm-hmm.
That he was in a relationship

35:31.530 --> 35:34.433
with a transgendered woman.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.903
And he committed suicide.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.908
Had she not been transgender,

35:42.941 --> 35:46.612
and had she not lived
in a, you know, a --

35:46.645 --> 35:48.580
a neighborhood that's known
to be, you know,

35:48.614 --> 35:50.716
social-economically challenged,
you know...

35:50.749 --> 35:52.518
Mm-hmm.
That maybe there would've been

35:52.551 --> 35:54.420
more attention 'cause I think,

35:54.453 --> 35:57.289
oftentimes, people
think that somebody

35:57.323 --> 35:59.791
who's transgender, nobody cares.
They're... You know?

35:59.825 --> 36:01.360
Well, they probably think that
they don't have a family...

36:01.393 --> 36:03.329
Uh, yeah, you know?
Or a family that cares.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.730
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.798
And, you know, Taja,
we were talking.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.468
And she would tell me,
"You know, Mom,

36:09.501 --> 36:12.904
you don't know how lucky
you are to wake up

36:12.938 --> 36:16.542
and everybody
sees you as a woman."

36:16.575 --> 36:21.413
And we can't get so caught up
in what's, you know,

36:21.447 --> 36:25.284
society expects or dictates
to us or what our church says

36:25.317 --> 36:27.819
because your children
are your children.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.755

and you accept them
unconditionally.

angry all day.

DANIEL: Yeah.
And I feel like I feel angry

36:40.732 --> 36:42.301
all day 'cause
we were just in Iowa,

36:42.334 --> 36:44.603
and we were surrounded by, like,

36:44.636 --> 36:47.473
so much homophobia.

I don't have time
for some conservative dude

spewing his shit,

36:52.978 --> 36:54.713

36:54.746 --> 36:57.516
It just is.
You can't tell me that it's not.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.919
You know, you have so much --
you have so much influence.

37:03.555 --> 37:09.528
And you are perpetuating
a society that is homophobic,

37:09.561 --> 37:13.999
that is transphobic.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.001
At that point, you don't wanna
hear about religious liberty.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.936
You don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit

37:17.969 --> 37:20.606
that you got your business
shut down because

37:20.639 --> 37:22.574
you will not let gay people
have a wedding at your venue.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.009
Yeah.
You just don't...

37:24.042 --> 37:26.278
Like, who gives a fuck, really?
I mean...

37:26.312 --> 37:27.679
Don't discriminate
towards people.

37:27.713 --> 37:28.980
Yeah.
Don't.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.716
It's like, just don't do it.
And don't --

37:30.749 --> 37:34.720
do not say that gay people
are now the bigots 'cause

37:34.753 --> 37:36.054
we want equal rights.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.523
That's not acceptable.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.957
It's not acceptable.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.460
Can we please move past this?
It's just...

37:41.493 --> 37:43.629
You -- you...
I really just find myself going,

37:43.662 --> 37:46.865
like, "What is wrong
with people?"

37:54.873 --> 37:59.511
PAGE:
We've seen firsthand how,

37:59.545 --> 38:01.513
even with the progress
being made,

38:01.547 --> 38:03.449
it can be incredibly difficult,

38:03.482 --> 38:04.683
even dangerous,

38:04.716 --> 38:07.586
to be young
and trans in America.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.421
That's why we're in Chicago,

38:09.455 --> 38:12.891
at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie
Children's Hospital.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.727
It's one of only a few
groundbreaking facilities

38:15.761 --> 38:18.697
in this country that provides
developmental support

38:18.730 --> 38:21.032
and early treatment
for trans youth.

38:21.066 --> 38:24.002
Dr. Robert Garofalo
is a pediatrician

38:24.035 --> 38:26.004
and director
of the gender program.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.740
Who would've predicted,
you know, 3 or 4 years

38:28.774 --> 38:30.742
ago that there would be
this explosion

38:30.776 --> 38:32.911
around sort
of transgender-related issues?

38:32.944 --> 38:34.946
Mm-hmm.
So we predicted it right.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.382
And we're ahead of the --

38:36.415 --> 38:39.084
sort of the curve
in terms of the planning

38:39.117 --> 38:40.586
for this type of program.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.020
Maybe we could just
get a general idea

38:42.053 --> 38:44.523
of what your project
does specifically.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.092
Yeah.
So we see children

38:47.125 --> 38:48.860
and adolescents,
really starting

38:48.894 --> 38:50.762
at the age
of about 3 or 4 up

38:50.796 --> 38:53.865
through about 20,
21, um, who are s --

38:53.899 --> 38:55.601
struggling or dealing

38:55.634 --> 38:58.970
with issues related to what
we call gender nonconformities.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.840
You know, so everyone
that walks into our clinic,

39:01.873 --> 39:03.509
you know, meets a team
of people:

39:03.542 --> 39:06.144
a medical provider,
a mental-health provider

39:06.177 --> 39:08.113
and then our program
support staff.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.648
I think that's not like a lot

39:09.681 --> 39:11.049
of other programs
in the country.

39:11.082 --> 39:13.819
But we've been, like, training
pediatric institutions

39:13.852 --> 39:16.855
and hospitals across the country
to sort of help, um,

39:16.888 --> 39:19.958
better understand how to build
a program like this

39:19.991 --> 39:21.593
and better care
for these children.

39:21.627 --> 39:22.761
Mm-hmm.
It's really about

39:22.794 --> 39:24.863
educating society at large

39:24.896 --> 39:28.600
that there is this fluidity
of gender expression

39:28.634 --> 39:30.736
and that there is
no gender binary,

39:30.769 --> 39:33.171
that there are a range
of expressions and that,

39:33.204 --> 39:35.874
certainly for young kids
and adolescents,

39:35.907 --> 39:38.477
that, you know,
their identity, uh,

39:38.510 --> 39:40.812
can remain somewhat fluid.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.614
Have you met some of the kids?

39:42.648 --> 39:44.082
'Cause they're, like, amazing.
Oh, we're going to.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.684
I mean, they're amazing.
Yeah.

39:45.717 --> 39:46.918
Yeah.
We can't wait, honestly.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.454
Yeah.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.721
I mean, you won't even
put me on.

39:49.755 --> 39:50.889
Once you meet these kids,
it's like,

39:50.922 --> 39:52.658
why put the doctor on?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.526
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.495
PAGE: Heather, who is 16,

39:56.528 --> 39:57.796
has been a patient at Lurie

39:57.829 --> 39:59.498
for the past 3 years

39:59.531 --> 40:01.500
and is transitioning
with the full support

40:01.533 --> 40:04.035
of her family.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.505
Um, it, I think it'd be nice to
maybe understand your childhood

40:06.538 --> 40:07.839
a little bit.
What was your childhood like?

40:07.873 --> 40:09.908
Or what were some questions
you were having?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.910
I guess I just remember being
pretty much just,

40:11.943 --> 40:16.081
like, a really awkward
little child.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.917
I guess, really...
I didn't really ever

40:18.950 --> 40:20.752
thought of myself as,
like, a boy.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.755
I just didn't really
feel comfortable with who I am,

40:23.789 --> 40:25.891
especially with
the people I was around.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.960
I was going through depression.

40:28.994 --> 40:32.564
When I was 13,
I went to my, uh, mom.

40:32.598 --> 40:36.001
And I was like,
I would really rather just more

40:36.034 --> 40:38.236
look like an everyday girl.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.871
Mm.
I just felt more comfortable.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.073
It just felt right.

40:42.107 --> 40:45.076
My mind just felt at peace,
where it's thinking of,

40:45.110 --> 40:47.679
"Yeah. I identify as a girl."

40:47.713 --> 40:49.748
When we first took her shopping
a couple times,

40:49.781 --> 40:51.216
I was all excited to buy stuff.

40:51.249 --> 40:52.951
But she never likes anything
that I like.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.086
She actually doesn't like
that girly stuff.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.755
Right.
Yeah.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.189
She gets stuff that's really
shiny and, like, glossy.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.626
It's like...
It's not your style.

41:00.659 --> 41:01.893
For me, it's just not for me.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.262
Like, I'm just --
I'm just not that...

41:04.295 --> 41:05.797
I'm just not that type of girl.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.065
Yeah, me neither.
Yeah.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.700
Many different
types of girls, yeah.

41:08.734 --> 41:10.736
We have that in common, yeah.
And so when --

41:10.769 --> 41:12.704
when you started talking
to your parents about it,

41:12.738 --> 41:14.105
what was --
what was your reaction?

41:14.139 --> 41:16.675
We -- we were very supportive.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.209
I read a few books.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.711
As soon as I read the books,
it seemed pretty clear.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.613
It's like, "Okay.
Well, let's...

41:21.647 --> 41:23.649
How do we make you happy again?"

41:23.682 --> 41:25.216
Being people of science, I --

41:25.250 --> 41:27.052
I don't believe in re--

41:27.085 --> 41:28.954
a religion.
I don't have that...

41:28.987 --> 41:30.722
I don't have that luxury
of having a faith.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.257
So this is what makes
you feel better.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.125
It's clearly working.

41:34.159 --> 41:37.996
It's clearly w-- what --
who she is on the inside.

41:38.029 --> 41:41.600
And I guess I'm curious about
what you would say to someone

41:41.633 --> 41:43.268
that doesn't have
supportive family

41:43.301 --> 41:45.904
or friends and kinda feel alone.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.741
It's just pretty much just,
you know...

41:49.775 --> 41:52.878
It's just,
uh, hold on.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.646
You know?
Mm-hmm.

41:59.651 --> 42:02.588
PAGE: I feel like, if I was 16
and going through something

42:02.621 --> 42:05.624
like that or even just
being attracted to women,

42:05.657 --> 42:08.193
A, I think I'd be a serious
emotional mess;

42:08.226 --> 42:11.730
B, hell, no, would I be letting
strangers with cameras in.

42:11.763 --> 42:15.066
Come in. The last time, we were
talking a lot about

42:15.100 --> 42:17.636
your boyfriend
coming up from Texas.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.004
Right.
Awesome.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.906
Oh, we didn't hear about this.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.841
I actually met a guy.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.810
At first, I was kinda
scared of telling him

42:24.843 --> 42:26.311
that I was actually trans.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.780
But having the experience
of telling him

42:28.814 --> 42:32.183
that and him being completely
fine with it, I was like, "Wow.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.654
Someone I actually
have full feelings for."

42:35.687 --> 42:37.623
But it's not, like,
a family member, right?

42:37.656 --> 42:39.925
It's a complete, like,
different person has these,

42:39.958 --> 42:41.326
like, strong feelings
for me as well.

42:41.359 --> 42:42.994
And then, that was,
like, the start.

42:43.028 --> 42:44.763
I was feeling...
I was like, "You know what?

42:44.796 --> 42:46.665
It really isn't a big deal."
It's like I shouldn't be

42:46.698 --> 42:50.201
hiding myself
for being who I am.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.137
It's just radical
to see young people

42:52.170 --> 42:54.105
speak so openly
and not be afraid.

42:54.139 --> 42:55.306
And it's just...
Yeah.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.307
I wish I was open that young.
Yeah.

42:56.341 --> 42:57.843
I do.
So much...

42:57.876 --> 42:59.177
I would never be able
to talk about it.

42:59.210 --> 43:00.378
I would be appalled
that they were even

43:00.411 --> 43:01.913
asking me that question,
you know,

43:01.947 --> 43:03.314
because I would be
so closeted and afraid

43:03.348 --> 43:07.819
and -- and chained by it.
So we're learning.

43:07.853 --> 43:09.755
Thanks so much, Heather.
No problem.

43:09.788 --> 43:11.823
Think you're so awesome.
Thank you.

43:11.857 --> 43:16.762
One, two, three.
Cute.

43:16.795 --> 43:19.665
PAGE: It's incredibly moving
to see that, no matter

43:19.698 --> 43:22.167
what, Heather's family
loves and supports her.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.670
But unfortunately,
for many trans youth,

43:24.703 --> 43:27.005
their journey of self-identity
begins alone.

43:27.038 --> 43:28.373
Hey, Neil.
Hey, Neil.

43:28.406 --> 43:30.108
Neil is also getting
treatment at Lurie...

43:30.141 --> 43:32.110
Nice to meet you.
But does not have the support

43:32.143 --> 43:35.714
or consent of his parents.

43:35.747 --> 43:37.148
Maybe start by telling us
how your family

43:37.182 --> 43:39.117
feels about what
you've been going through

43:39.150 --> 43:41.252
and what you're
going through now.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.154
Um, so right now,
both of my parents

43:43.188 --> 43:44.823
are very unsupportive.

43:44.856 --> 43:48.159
When I told my mom, she cried
and blamed herself because

43:48.193 --> 43:51.763
she thought it was because of
her that I am the way I am.

43:51.797 --> 43:54.165
Mm.
It's more of a surprise
to me that --

43:54.199 --> 43:57.168
that parents can be
supportive and loving.

43:57.202 --> 43:58.704
And people say that,

43:58.737 --> 44:00.371
"Oh, you know, my mom
did this thing for me."

44:00.405 --> 44:03.809
And I'm like,
"Moms do that for you?"

44:03.842 --> 44:06.344
Do you hope that, over time,
they'll begin to understand

44:06.377 --> 44:08.413
and, um... Or what are your --

44:08.446 --> 44:10.048
what are your thoughts
about that?

44:10.081 --> 44:13.384
I personally don't feel
like my parents

44:13.418 --> 44:15.053
will ever adjust.

44:15.086 --> 44:17.155
My mom says that, you know,
the more I do this,

44:17.188 --> 44:19.991
the more she's going to cut
communication with me.

44:20.025 --> 44:22.060
So...
Mm. I'm so sorry.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.862
Yeah.

44:23.895 --> 44:26.231
Right now, what would you say
is your biggest challenge?

44:26.264 --> 44:28.433
The people around me have
to try so hard

44:28.466 --> 44:30.235
for me to make sure I'm happy.

44:30.268 --> 44:31.970
And I have to try hard
for myself

44:32.003 --> 44:33.338
to make sure I'm happy.

44:33.371 --> 44:37.208
Sometimes, I'll feel
that it's just easier

44:37.242 --> 44:39.778
to just stop everything
and give it up

44:39.811 --> 44:44.482
and just live a life
that people want me to.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.217
But at the same time,

44:46.251 --> 44:48.754
to imagine a life

44:48.787 --> 44:52.490
where I can't be who I am is,

44:52.523 --> 44:54.459
um,

44:54.492 --> 44:56.461
definitely not a life
I would ever like to live.

44:56.494 --> 44:57.929
Mm-hmm.

44:57.963 --> 45:00.265
People need to evolve
to respect you

45:00.298 --> 45:01.933
and love you for who you are.

45:01.967 --> 45:03.769
That's just your right
as a human.

45:03.802 --> 45:07.205
And that's your right as a man.

45:07.238 --> 45:09.841
You deserve to be happy.

45:20.085 --> 45:21.352

45:21.386 --> 45:24.089
PAGE: We're in New York City,
a place

45:24.122 --> 45:26.792
where many young people
create their own families

45:26.825 --> 45:28.259
and support systems.

45:28.293 --> 45:30.962
These communities,
in expressing their identity,

45:30.996 --> 45:35.200
created powerful movements
in queer art and pop culture.

45:35.233 --> 45:38.269
One of the most prominent
of which is voguing.

45:38.303 --> 45:41.873
It came out of the 1980s
Harlem Ballroom Scene.

45:41.907 --> 45:44.175
This highly stylized
dance battle

45:44.209 --> 45:47.145
grew into a worldwide
cultural phenomenon

45:47.178 --> 45:49.547
and brought with it
mainstream exposure

45:49.580 --> 45:51.316
for the gay and trans community.

45:51.349 --> 45:54.552
So we are here in New York,

45:54.585 --> 45:56.287
checking out
a classic vogue night.

45:56.321 --> 45:59.257
But first, we have to pregame
in Brooklyn with our host

45:59.290 --> 46:01.259
for the night, CUNTMAFIA.

46:01.292 --> 46:04.029

I -- I think, really,
what would be cool to know

46:25.283 --> 46:27.185
is, for people that don't
know about voguing...

46:27.218 --> 46:28.319
Yeah.
Like, what is it,

46:28.353 --> 46:29.921
what its significance is.

46:29.955 --> 46:31.957
Well, voguing is really
important to the, um,

46:31.990 --> 46:33.959
LGBT people of color
because, I guess,

46:33.992 --> 46:36.194
if you get banned from, like,
playing at the Olympics,

46:36.227 --> 46:37.929

46:37.963 --> 46:39.264
Yeah.
They come out.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.966
They get disowned.
And that's where they go.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.467
They go to the ballroom scene.
That's why you have houses.

46:42.500 --> 46:45.070
They -- they become family.
It's bigger than just voguing.

46:45.103 --> 46:47.205
They use that to get
away from all

46:47.238 --> 46:48.606
that extra dumb shit 'cause
it's like...

46:48.639 --> 46:49.975
Right.
Sometimes, it's really hard,

46:50.008 --> 46:51.476
you know?
But the underground

46:51.509 --> 46:53.611
is also not becoming
so underground anymore 'cause,

46:53.644 --> 46:55.947
even if you look at a lot of,
like, the celebrities,

46:55.981 --> 46:57.615

like underground artists anyway.

47:04.555 --> 47:06.124

a lot of artists.

49:25.763 --> 49:29.567
in helping LGBTQ youth
get off the streets.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.502
You know, L.A. sort of
has the dubious distinction

49:31.536 --> 49:33.638
of being the homeless youth
capital of the country.

49:33.671 --> 49:35.273
And there's a couple reasons
for that.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.742
One is the weather here
is better than, you know,

49:37.775 --> 49:39.377
any place where it snows.
Mm-hmm.

49:39.410 --> 49:41.046
And the other is that there's
sort of these ideas

49:41.079 --> 49:42.647
that kids are gonna come here
and be discovered and sort

49:42.680 --> 49:45.516
of the Hollywood glamour,
which is obviously not the case

49:45.550 --> 49:47.085
for most of our clients.

49:47.118 --> 49:48.686
So oftentimes, what will happen:

49:48.719 --> 49:51.356
These kids will get off the bus
with everything they own,

49:51.389 --> 49:53.191
typically in backpack.

49:53.224 --> 49:55.426
And within that first week,
they are likely to be beaten,

49:55.460 --> 49:57.262
robbed of
all of their possessions.

49:57.295 --> 49:59.430
They are likely to have done
drugs for the very first time.

49:59.464 --> 50:01.266
And they are likely to have
performed their first act

50:01.299 --> 50:02.767
of survival sex,
which is typically

50:02.800 --> 50:05.203
not for money, even.

50:05.236 --> 50:07.772
It's for food
or for a place to stay.

50:07.805 --> 50:10.641
To give you sort of a sense
of the scale of the problem,

50:10.675 --> 50:12.810
there are about 200 beds
in L.A. County

50:12.843 --> 50:16.114
that are specifically funded
for youth in general.

50:16.147 --> 50:17.648
Mm-hmm.
So if there are 6,000 kids

50:17.682 --> 50:19.217
on the street, the need

50:19.250 --> 50:21.452
so dramatically
outstrips the resources...

"It's Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Steve."

And so I got kicked out.

50:44.242 --> 50:46.711

you know, was to stop hurting,

50:46.744 --> 50:48.179
to stop the pain

51:14.705 --> 51:16.574
It's so easy to get to.

Because there is a lot
of sex work out here.

51:18.609 --> 51:19.877
Yeah.
So they do do it

51:19.910 --> 51:21.612
to, kind of, numb themselves.

51:21.646 --> 51:24.182
Not... Yeah, numb themselves
so they don't f...

to do sex work...

for the trans male community?

53:51.896 --> 53:53.331

question constantly.

53:53.364 --> 53:54.499
That's the golden question.
Mm-hmm.

53:54.532 --> 53:56.501
And to me,
it's rooted in misogyny.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.269

that trans women,
of color specifically,

54:04.742 --> 54:06.511
are given a platform 'cause

54:06.544 --> 54:09.447
I'm not facing
the same struggles.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.417
I get to assimilate into society

54:12.450 --> 54:14.385
a white straight man, you know?
Mm-hmm.

54:14.419 --> 54:16.554
Uh, that's... Obviously,
that's not how I identify.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.956
But that's how I'm read
and observed.

54:18.989 --> 54:22.460
But I feel like a big fear is,
like, am I a real person?

54:22.493 --> 54:23.861
That's just, like,
a baseline fear

54:23.894 --> 54:26.564
I have on a regular basis.
What if someone finds out?

54:26.597 --> 54:28.699

at this point 'cause, like...

Yeah.

happen if people do find out?

54:35.373 --> 54:36.607

differently?

they'll think about my genitals.

Always.

But it's just...

54:41.812 --> 54:42.980
Yeah.
A fear of, like, being treated

54:43.013 --> 54:44.849
differently and being seen as...
A freak.

54:44.882 --> 54:46.684
Freak.
Right.

54:46.717 --> 54:48.719
On some level, we all share
that experience of,

54:48.753 --> 54:50.988
like, "I'm gonna act
like something I'm not."

54:51.021 --> 54:53.624
Even, like, growing up
in -- in Indiana,

54:53.658 --> 54:55.092
if I could've acted
like I wanted to,

54:55.125 --> 54:56.461
I would be, like, sashaying.

54:56.494 --> 54:58.095
You know, I probably would.

54:58.128 --> 54:59.864
But instead, I'm like, "I'm
gonna have to walk like this."

54:59.897 --> 55:01.466
Yeah.

55:01.499 --> 55:02.700
"I'm gonna have to talk
like this. My voice

55:02.733 --> 55:04.402
is gonna get a little deeper."
Mm-hmm.

55:04.435 --> 55:06.571
And when people would ask me
if I'm gay, I'd be like,

55:06.604 --> 55:07.838
"What did you just say?"

55:07.872 --> 55:09.407
Like, you run off, you know?

55:09.440 --> 55:10.675
And -- and you just
don't acknowledge it.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.343
And, um,

55:12.377 --> 55:15.746

go through that today.

55:21.519 --> 55:23.120
how to be safe
at all times

55:23.153 --> 55:25.390
and that your relationship
to others

55:25.423 --> 55:26.857
is conditional upon

55:26.891 --> 55:31.562
how you present yourself really
creates barriers.

55:31.596 --> 55:34.399
But when you are a queer kid
and you know that you're queer

55:34.432 --> 55:36.367

to remove all of that

55:36.401 --> 55:37.968

Indiana originally.

58:47.625 --> 58:49.193
That's where I'm from.
Yeah.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.796
So what was it like growing up
in Indiana when you were young?

58:51.829 --> 58:53.297
Well, I was bullied

58:53.330 --> 58:56.166
after they found out
that I was a homosexual.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.334
Yeah.
There was no such word

58:57.367 --> 58:58.903
as gay.
Right.

58:58.936 --> 59:01.105
And then I went to transform,

59:01.138 --> 59:03.073
to become a woman.

59:03.107 --> 59:06.143
And I got dra--
involved with drugs

59:06.176 --> 59:07.612
and everything.
Mm.

59:07.645 --> 59:09.079

and then getting in pro--

59:09.113 --> 59:12.249
to prostitution and going
to jail so many times.

59:12.282 --> 59:14.184
And then, one day,
I just finally decided

59:14.218 --> 59:15.820
I can't take it anymore
and left.

59:15.853 --> 59:20.124
But I overcome that
after I joined the Army.

59:20.157 --> 59:21.792
Ah.
Which I kept it secret,

59:21.826 --> 59:24.094
you know, that --
that I was who I was.

59:24.128 --> 59:26.363
And so to be here, it just means
that you can live freely.

59:26.396 --> 59:29.800
I can be myself. And where I was
at before, for 30 years,

59:29.834 --> 59:32.302
I was scared to walk
down the hall to go outside.

59:32.336 --> 59:33.871
This is my home, you know?

59:33.904 --> 59:36.306
And I love everybody here.

59:36.340 --> 59:38.743
And where are you from?
I was born in L.A.,

59:38.776 --> 59:42.379
and back then,
it was very difficult.

59:42.412 --> 59:45.816
I struggled as a kid
with mom and dad

59:45.850 --> 59:48.052

But God loves us just the way
that we are.

59:51.121 --> 59:54.124

how anybody else thinks.

59:54.158 --> 59:55.793
It's okay to be who you are.

59:55.826 --> 59:58.863
I was in a relationship
for 36 years.

59:58.896 --> 1:00:02.032
We raised a son together,
so my son had two mommies.

1:00:02.066 --> 1:00:03.267
Awesome.

1:00:03.300 --> 1:00:05.803
And my other half passed away,

1:00:05.836 --> 1:00:08.906
and then I met Nancy.

1:00:10.908 --> 1:00:12.643
Yes.
Ah!

She's just been more
than a friend to me.

1:00:15.312 --> 1:00:18.849
I mean, she's just been there,
you know, to pick up the pieces.

1:00:18.883 --> 1:00:22.720
And, uh, and this place
is such a safe haven

1:00:22.753 --> 1:00:25.089
because if you live
anywhere else,

1:00:25.122 --> 1:00:28.693
you have to pretend
to be somebody else.

1:03:28.372 --> 1:03:30.140
so I've always been
out in my life.

1:03:30.174 --> 1:03:32.142
And in terms
of my business,

1:03:32.176 --> 1:03:34.845
I happened to be
in an industry where,

1:03:34.879 --> 1:03:37.381
if you're an executive
and you're gay,

1:03:37.414 --> 1:03:39.049
it's not an issue.
Mm.

1:03:39.083 --> 1:03:40.417
So I never hid it,

1:03:40.450 --> 1:03:42.519
and I'm very proud
of my relationship

1:03:42.552 --> 1:03:44.388
and proud of my family.

1:03:44.421 --> 1:03:46.256
I felt like I've been
a good example

1:03:46.290 --> 1:03:49.994
of a successful person
who happens to be gay.

1:03:50.027 --> 1:03:52.396
So we met when I was 20?
Um...

1:03:52.429 --> 1:03:54.564
Yeah, 20.
I was about to be 21.

1:03:54.598 --> 1:03:56.133
I have to say,

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:58.368
you were a different person
than you are now.

1:03:58.402 --> 1:04:01.872
It's crazy, actually,
how much you've changed...

1:04:01.906 --> 1:04:04.108
Mm.
In particular
since you came out.

1:04:04.141 --> 1:04:06.543
I think what's an interesting
conversation is your evolution.

1:04:06.576 --> 1:04:08.645
My visual is you like this...
Yeah.

1:04:08.678 --> 1:04:11.315
Like, hiding.
To being like, you came out

1:04:11.348 --> 1:04:13.283
and something did
totally change.

1:04:13.317 --> 1:04:14.584
I remember even
being overwhelmed

1:04:14.618 --> 1:04:16.253
in that time
because I was young.

1:04:16.286 --> 1:04:17.654
I was still figuring out
my own identity,

1:04:17.687 --> 1:04:19.623
and people were writing
about my sexuality.

1:04:19.656 --> 1:04:21.458
It was just overwhelming
for sure.

1:04:21.491 --> 1:04:23.193
Mm-hmm.
But that wouldn't be happening

1:04:23.227 --> 1:04:25.562
if there were
more out gay people,

1:04:25.595 --> 1:04:27.031
particularly young, out,

1:04:27.064 --> 1:04:28.933
gay people in Hollywood.
Yeah.

1:04:28.966 --> 1:04:31.902
But, also, you felt confident
and ready to do that.

1:04:31.936 --> 1:04:33.470
But in terms of Hollywood

1:04:33.503 --> 1:04:37.341
and being out,
it's still very new.

1:04:37.374 --> 1:04:39.176
You were supported fully
by everyone

1:04:39.209 --> 1:04:40.510
in your life and embraced.

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:43.147
And you are having,
like, a very busy,

1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:44.581
active career moment right now.

1:04:44.614 --> 1:04:46.550
But in terms of long term,

1:04:46.583 --> 1:04:48.385
will it have affected
your career?

1:04:48.418 --> 1:04:49.586
We don't know.
Mm-hmm.

1:04:49.619 --> 1:04:51.321
You know, we'll see.

1:04:51.355 --> 1:04:53.157
We'll see.
Yeah.

1:04:53.190 --> 1:04:56.927
**

1:05:02.199 --> 1:05:04.134
I can't hold a surfboard
like this

1:05:04.168 --> 1:05:05.669
because my arms
aren't long enough.

1:05:05.702 --> 1:05:08.272
I have to hold it...
Over your head.

1:05:19.516 --> 1:05:21.285
PAGE: Of course, there's still
a long way to go.

1:05:21.318 --> 1:05:23.653
That's very --
that's very, very evident.

1:05:25.990 --> 1:05:28.558
It does feel
like this massive societal shift

1:05:28.592 --> 1:05:29.994
needs to happen,

1:05:30.027 --> 1:05:33.197
which I'm hopeful will happen.

1:05:33.230 --> 1:05:37.001
And it's because young people
are moving past this.

1:05:39.236 --> 1:05:41.405
And this noise
and this political rhetoric

1:05:41.438 --> 1:05:42.973
is going to disappear.

1:05:43.007 --> 1:05:45.209
And if the politicians
don't make it disappear,

1:05:45.242 --> 1:05:47.011
they're going to disappear.

1:05:49.313 --> 1:05:53.050
It can feel daunting
with what we've seen,

1:05:53.083 --> 1:05:55.519
but it does feel
like love prevails.

1:05:55.552 --> 1:05:59.056
