Standard!

00:03.520 --> 00:05.440
Standard!

00:05.480 --> 00:08.480
Come and get your Standard!
Standard, sir?

00:08.520 --> 00:12.680
Standard!
Biggest gold heist of the century!

00:12.720 --> 00:14.160
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

00:14.200 --> 00:18.520
Standard!
Come and get your Standard!

00:18.560 --> 00:20.800
Biggest gold heist of the century!

00:20.840 --> 00:23.320
"The Metropolitan Police
are this morning investigating

00:23.360 --> 00:26.960
"what is believed to be
one of the biggest armed robberies
of all time."

00:27.000 --> 00:30.280
"They are searching for a blue van
which was seen in the area
at the time

00:30.320 --> 00:32.160
"and is believed to be connected..."

00:32.200 --> 00:34.360
"Police say there's no real evidence
to go on.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.160
"The robbery was not captured
on camera

00:36.200 --> 00:39.960
"and is believed to have been
meticulously planned
by a professional gang."

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
"..believed to be one of
the biggest armed robberies..."

00:42.040 --> 00:45.360
"..among items stolen from
the east London storage facility..."

00:45.400 --> 00:47.680
REPORTER SPEAKS SPANISH

00:47.720 --> 00:50.240
..a professional job,
and we suspect ex-military.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.760
..reported to be 7,000 gold bars.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.560
"The robbery has been described..."
'It was surreal.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.200
'Like watching ourselves in a movie.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.240
'The whole world talking about us,

01:01.280 --> 01:05.120
'painting pictures
of dangerous criminals

01:05.160 --> 01:08.560
"We will very much be ensuring
that these criminals
are brought to justice."

01:08.600 --> 01:12.480
"We will bring the full force of the
law down on upon them for the crimes
they have carried out."

01:19.000 --> 01:20.720
All right, boys.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.600
First things first, couple of
loose ends to tie up. Yeah.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.840
Phil, you're in charge
of the getaway vehicle.
What, lick of paint, change the reg?

01:27.880 --> 01:31.200
Destroy it.
Destroy it, obviously, as well.
I was about to say that, Clive.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.080
Mick, are you...
Do you wanna do that with me?
Yeah, consider me there, mate.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.320
Alberto, me old mucker!
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

01:37.360 --> 01:40.600
JOE LAUGHS
Your job...Yeah?

01:40.640 --> 01:42.800
..is to make sure your
brother-in-law keeps his mouth shut.

01:42.840 --> 01:46.240
The filth are gonna be
right up his arse.
You need to make sure it's clean.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.720
Yeah. Def...

01:48.760 --> 01:51.360
I-In sort of, in what way clean?

01:51.400 --> 01:53.040
It means make sure
Sidney doesn't rat.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.320
Right. Sorry. Got ya. It was all
the arse stuff, it threw me off!

01:56.360 --> 01:58.440
JOE LAUGHS
Yeah. Got ya.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.000
You boys have done very well.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.040
Very well indeed!
Thank you! Thank you.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.560
But there's a lot of work
left to do.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.440
It's just the beginning.
Yeah, it's just the beginning.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.720
Really? Cos I felt like
it was more like the end,

02:10.760 --> 02:15.680
just because we've already
got everything we needed, I thought.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.480
I can see how you're feeling,
Alberto.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.040
If you wanna take the money and run,
there's no shame in that.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.280
No shame in that whatsoever.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.600
Leave us to deal with the gold.
There's a good few grand in there.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.880
You can take it,
leave the dirty work to us.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.320
Easier for ya. Yeah, I mean...
Could I? Cos that'd be...

02:35.360 --> 02:37.320
Absolutely. Yeah? Yeah.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.280
We can do an even split.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.560
You take the money,
we take the gold.

02:42.600 --> 02:47.240
If I'm honest, that's a huge relief
because I'm not really built
for all this,

02:47.280 --> 02:51.880
so thank you very much. Absolutely.
We can do an even split. A-A-A-Aye!

02:51.920 --> 02:54.200
I'm gonna have to tell you
to hold your horse here, pal.

02:54.240 --> 02:59.960
We need to talk about this decision
amongst us, as friends.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.840
How much is that gold worth?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.400
That's a piece of gold.
That's a ring.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.680
How much is the ring worth?
200 quid?

03:05.720 --> 03:09.760
So you go one...
BOTH: Two, three, four, five...

03:09.800 --> 03:13.640
That's a grand.Joey...All right!
HE LAUGHS HEARTILY

03:13.680 --> 03:17.120
D'you know what? We can make
a decision on who takes the gold...

03:17.160 --> 03:20.120
..after the evidence is destroyed.
Sleep on it.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.600
Tomorrow night we meet back here.
Back here tomorrow night.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.200
What sort of time you thinking?
Seven.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.040
Of course. In the meantime,

03:27.080 --> 03:29.760
keep your heads down.
Yep. No talking to each other.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.800
In the case of Mick and Phil,
are we allowed to talk
while we're in the van together?

03:33.840 --> 03:38.360
Is that permitted? Obviously
because it'll be quite complicated
if we can't have a chat.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.960
He was joking.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.720
I'm not joking. What have I told you
about asking stupid questions?

03:53.280 --> 03:55.520
Looks like they came in
and exited through the main door.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.880
The CCTV was turned off,

03:57.920 --> 04:02.160
it may be just bad luck,
but it got me thinking about
the possibility of an inside job.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.680
There's a few things
that don't really add up here, Guv.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.800
Well, that's only ifs and maybes,
innit, Thread?

04:06.840 --> 04:10.840
This is what's happening.
Me and the boys are gonna go round
and do a synchronised smashdown

04:10.880 --> 04:13.600
on everyone in the area who's got
armed robbery on their records.

04:13.640 --> 04:17.240
Well, just before we do that,
I think it might be worth doing
a recreation with the guards.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.240
Go through everything that happened,

04:19.280 --> 04:21.720
where everyone was.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.320
A reconstruction.
What do you mean?

04:25.360 --> 04:26.840
Like a school play?

04:26.880 --> 04:28.960
It can be quite useful
to see everyone's movements.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.400
For example, how the robbers were
able to get in through the main door
without having to force it.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.680
OK, fine.

04:43.160 --> 04:47.400
But if that doesn't work,
I want every armed robber on my desk
first thing Monday morning.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.080
Are we clear? Yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.560
Fuck!

05:10.760 --> 05:14.360
"Our main story is still the biggest
gold heist in history last night,

05:14.400 --> 05:17.440
"where a number of gold bars,
thought to be worth Â£30 million

05:17.480 --> 05:22.160
"were stolen from a storage compound
in east London." 30 million?
Did you hear that? 30 million.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.280
That's a lot more
than what Clive said it was worth.

05:24.320 --> 05:28.200
He must not have realised. That,
or he's pulling down our pants.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.080
He's not gonna pull down the pants
of someone that he respects,
his right-hand man,

05:32.120 --> 05:33.520
someone that's part of the Firm.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.160
What, Joey? No, me! Everyone knows
I'm part of the Firm, Mick!

05:36.200 --> 05:40.160
Let me be clear here, mate. I don't
need no help pulling my pants down.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.880
I can pull my pants down on my own.

05:41.920 --> 05:46.160
You tell Clive, he's coming for
my pants, have a big breakfast, son!

05:46.200 --> 05:48.680
And bring an army with ya,
cos you'll need 'em!

05:48.720 --> 05:51.000
Mick, breathe for a bit.

05:53.040 --> 05:58.120
Where the fuck are we? It's a little
place Big Mick likes to call...

05:58.160 --> 05:59.800
..the middle of nowhere.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.320
This thing is gonna go up
like a dragon's arsehole.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.480
So, what, is this gonna blow up
or just burn out?

06:24.520 --> 06:26.400
Phil, Phil, please, mate. What?

06:26.440 --> 06:28.560
Just show a little patience, please.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.240
Ah, I love 'em.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.640
I get some of my best thinking done
looking into the flames of a fire.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.920
How long is this gonna take?
Hours, mate. I ain't got a time.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.720
Hours? Hours, mate!
It takes as long as it takes.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.840
That was really loud.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.320
Don't worry, mate.
There's no prying ears here.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.080
We might as well be on the moon.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.920
Right,
where have you stashed the car?

06:59.480 --> 07:03.680
Pardon me?
Why is that my responsibility?
You're in charge of transport, boy.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.240
You didn't think about
stashing a car to get home?
It's not my job to think!

07:07.280 --> 07:09.600
I really worry
about what's going on in your head.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.000
That's not fair! You're grouchy,
you're being out of order.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.160
I'm not listening to you
when you're like this!
We're in the fucking moors!

07:16.200 --> 07:21.240
I know we're in the... And also,
our A to Z's in there, so now
we don't know where we're going.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.440
Great! That's from the library,
so that's a fine!

07:24.480 --> 07:27.840
Well, do you wanna get it?
No, it's on fire now, you plum!

07:29.200 --> 07:33.040
If we just take the cash, we can be
out of here. We don't need the gold.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.680
Well, you've stolen it now, darling.
You've done the hard part.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.520
But I didn't know
what I was stealing, did I?

07:37.560 --> 07:41.200
It could be from the Royal Treasury
for all we know.
That's like killing a swan.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.960
People get hung
for that sort of thing.
No-one gets hung for killing a swan.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.480
I wish I'd never got involved
in this. We were happy enough
before all this.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.040
Were we? Well...

07:51.080 --> 07:53.080
30 million pound that gold's worth.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.880
30! Sidney, shut up! "Biggest
Gold Heist of the Century!" Great!

07:56.920 --> 08:00.400
There's a cafe full of people!
They think we're ex-military
because it was so well organised.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.840
Maybe I should be in the military.
Or MI5.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.560
I could get one of those James Bond
exploding pens
that blows yer hand off.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.040
Sidney, stop running your mouth.
Just shut up, Sidney.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.360
You two need to calm down. Look,
they haven't got anything on us.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.520
BELL RINGS
"Highly organised."

08:13.560 --> 08:17.160
"Highly organised" they call us.
Well, me technically,
because it was my job, wasn't it?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.120
Fuck, it's Saunders! It's Saunders!

08:19.160 --> 08:22.560
Saunders!
Don't! Put it in the bin!

08:22.600 --> 08:23.880
What are you doing?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.200
Albert!

08:26.240 --> 08:28.960
Albert, get up!
Why do I have to be out?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.240
You have to be up here
running a cafe like normal! Great(!)

08:32.280 --> 08:34.920
Why does he get to hide?
Tash, I'm gonna stay down here.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.880
Ssh! Don't tell him I'm here.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.840
Morning, Natasha, love.
You all right? Yeah!

08:40.880 --> 08:42.440
Good. Yeah.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.680
I'm noticing you had a bit of salmon
on the menu today.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.120
Me and Albert just, erm, love it.
Oh, I love a bit of salmon.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.120
Where's Albert? Here I am.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.000
Running my cafe, as usual!
How you doing, Albert?

08:53.040 --> 08:57.040
Yeah, good. Classic day at the cafe,
really! Good, good, good.

08:57.080 --> 09:00.560
What can we get ya, Inspector?
Just the usual, please, Tash.
Soft egg, Alb.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.600
Yep. Got ya. Yeah.
I'll just go and do that now, then!

09:06.120 --> 09:08.800
So, how's it going? Not bad, Tash.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.040
Got me work cut out, as you can see,
today.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.360
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I heard about that one.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.520
Any leads?
Fuck all at the moment, girl.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.120
But mark my words, Tash,

09:17.160 --> 09:19.640
we'll get 'em.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.800
Good.

09:20.840 --> 09:25.160
You had any suspicious-looking
characters in here
over the past few weeks?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.760
Actually, yeah.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.480
Erm... A couple of days ago,
actually.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.200
There was some really
suspicious-looking people.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.960
Suspicious how, Tash?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh, erm...

09:38.000 --> 09:40.160
..talking quietly.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.880
Some of them
were wearing sunglasses.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.480
Sunglasses? Yeah.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.960
Anything else, Tash?
Accents. Some of 'em had accents.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.800
Funny accents? Yeah. There you go.
Softest egg in the East End for ya!

09:50.840 --> 09:53.040
Even tucked in an extra sausage
for you there.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.600
Oh, did you want a sauce?
Brown sauce. Brown sauce!

09:55.640 --> 09:57.520
Absolutely incredible choice.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.160
You always have brown sauce.
I actually always have brown sauce,
as well. I love the stuff.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.320
Er, yeah, I have it with, like,

10:03.360 --> 10:05.920
even just,
obviously fry-ups and that,

10:05.960 --> 10:07.800
but even fish and chips some...

10:07.840 --> 10:12.360
Well, not with the fish.
That wouldn't really work, would it?
Not for me. Nah, same here.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.920
There we go.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.000
Brown sauce? Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry!

10:17.040 --> 10:20.520
What's wrong with me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.360
Ah, God!
HE LAUGHS

10:22.400 --> 10:26.120
Here we go. I-Is that enough for ya?
That's lovely. Yeah. Here we go.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.400
What do I owe you, son?
Oh, no, don't...

10:28.440 --> 10:30.720
Yeah, no. Don't offend me!
It's on the house!

10:30.760 --> 10:32.720
Yeah, your money's no good here.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.160
Be lucky. Cheers, Chief! All right.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.080
You can do it, mate.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.800
Out the way! Fucking ridiculous!
It's a dance, mate!

11:00.840 --> 11:04.000
You gotta smile, you gotta own it!
Own it!

11:04.040 --> 11:07.200
Are you going to London, mate?

11:07.240 --> 11:09.760
So degrading! We should just
steal a car, get home.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.240
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey, hey!

11:11.280 --> 11:12.360
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:12.400 --> 11:14.080
Don't shout at me!
You don't shout at me!

11:14.120 --> 11:16.040
Don't shout at me!
I'm sick of your shoutin'!

11:16.080 --> 11:20.240
I'm done with this!
We are not stealing a car.
We just destroyed one stolen car!

11:20.280 --> 11:22.400
We steal another car,
we've got to destroy that!

11:22.440 --> 11:26.680
Then we're in a vicious circle
of destroying car after car, mate!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.640
Phil! Philip!

11:28.680 --> 11:30.680

you come back here!

11:49.880 --> 11:51.440
The man himself. Joey!

11:51.480 --> 11:54.600
Also the man himself, as well.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.320
Well, the better man, if anything!

11:56.360 --> 11:59.680
My better half! No, that's...
Not like that.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.360
I saw the filth were in here earlier,
sniffing about. Ah, God, yeah.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.520
No, that's just Saunders.
He's always in here, just, er...

12:05.560 --> 12:09.080
He was just asking if
we've heard anything. Bloody pig!

12:09.120 --> 12:10.680
Too right! Too right!

12:10.720 --> 12:14.520
What did you tell him?
Well, nothing. You know me,

12:14.560 --> 12:19.920
the old, er, slaving away, chained
to the hobs, pots and pans. Yeah.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.400
Tasha done really well, so, yeah.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.560
What, you told your missus?

12:25.600 --> 12:28.920
HE STAMMERS
No, yeah, no, Sidney told her.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.080
Sidney? Yeah. Where is he?

12:31.120 --> 12:32.960
Have you seen him?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.440
No.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.880
Are you sure?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.040
Erm, no, yeah, no.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.880
"Yeah, no" what?
Why do you keep saying "yeah, no"?

12:41.920 --> 12:44.560
I don't know!
It's really out of character.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.840
I never say that usually.
Erm, I'm trying to think.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.280
Yesterday I saw him...

12:49.320 --> 12:52.520
No, you're right.
I saw him today, as well. Yeah. No.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.160
God, I... Yeah, yesterday...
I think I saw him both days

12:55.200 --> 12:57.880
and that's where the confusion was,
I think.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.760
Er, so, yeah. No, he's all great.

13:00.800 --> 13:06.000
Nothing to worry about. Right.
Not that you'd worry about it.
You probably never worry.

13:06.040 --> 13:10.000
So I can tell Clive
you're on top of it all, yeah?
Yeah, well, not just me, but...

13:10.040 --> 13:12.160
But, yes, completely.

13:12.200 --> 13:17.720
Just looking forward to it
all being over, i-if I'm honest.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.800
In a good way, though.
I-In a really good way.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.560
30 million they think it's worth.

13:23.600 --> 13:27.360
HE LAUGHS
Well, it won't be worth that much,
Tash.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.200
You know what the press are like.
Yeah, Tash!

13:29.240 --> 13:33.320
You know what the press are like,
man. They're always yapping about
and exaggera-

13:33.360 --> 13:36.760
Look after yourself, yeah? Yeah.

13:40.760 --> 13:45.000
HE LAUGHS
Alberto!

13:45.040 --> 13:47.560
Joey!

13:47.600 --> 13:50.160
See you tomorrow, man. Mate.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.920
Nice. Really well handled.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.520
I thought so.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.280
I can't wait to put a bullet
in that cunt's head.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.240
Sidney first,

14:08.280 --> 14:10.480
then the rest.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.720
Sidney Wilson?

14:48.760 --> 14:51.960
If you'd like to come with us.
W-What...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.120
What's this about?

15:01.160 --> 15:04.560
OK, so the entry point
was via the shutters.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.000
So, who opened the shutters?

15:08.040 --> 15:10.240
EXHALES LOUDLY

15:10.280 --> 15:12.520
Oh, yeah, that was me.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.160
What's your name, sunshine?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.360
Wilson. Sidney Wilson.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.360
Did you get a good look at 'em,
Sidney?

15:18.400 --> 15:22.280
No. D-Didn't see any of them at all.
Erm, no.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.160
Well, what did they sound like,
Sidney?

15:24.200 --> 15:27.280
I didn't hear... I didn't hear them,
either. I didn't...

15:27.320 --> 15:29.080
You mean they didn't say anything,
Sidney?

15:29.120 --> 15:32.880
No funny accents
or nothing like that?

15:32.920 --> 15:35.520
Accents? They did have accents.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.480
Yes. They was northern.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.800
Cos they came in and they...
HE STAMMERS

15:40.840 --> 15:42.480
..sort of said, erm,

15:42.520 --> 15:45.000
INDISTINCT ACCENT
.."Get on the floor
and open the shutters!"

15:45.040 --> 15:48.080
They told you to get on the floor
and open the shutters?
The shutters were closed?

15:48.120 --> 15:51.120
Yeah, yeah, no, cos they, erm...

15:51.160 --> 15:54.360
HE STAMMERS
Cos the shutters are always closed,

15:54.400 --> 15:57.840
so, erm, at that point,
they would've been closed,

15:57.880 --> 16:00.400
cos there's no reason why
I would've opened them for them

16:00.440 --> 16:02.640
cos I didn't know
they were even gonna come.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.920
You must've got a good look
at the others,

16:04.960 --> 16:08.520
so how many were there in total,
Sidney?

16:08.560 --> 16:12.240
No, cos, erm,
cos I wasn't near the window

16:12.280 --> 16:15.240
when they... When the van came in,
I wasn't near the window.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.160
Where were you? I was,
where I was, actually, was just,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.040
I was standing over here,

16:21.080 --> 16:26.200
so I was... Where the window is,
I didn't really...

16:26.240 --> 16:27.600
Can you demonstrate?

16:27.640 --> 16:31.000
Yeah, I was just...
I was just here, like,

16:31.040 --> 16:33.600
erm, just leaning here, I think.
OK.

16:33.640 --> 16:38.880
Would you mind pressing the button,
Sidney? Press... Press the button?

16:38.920 --> 16:40.760
So I just, erm,

16:40.800 --> 16:43.320
just stand like that
and then just pressed it,

16:43.360 --> 16:46.000
and then press that.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.000
Is that how you would normally
press the button?

16:48.040 --> 16:51.400
Yeah. Yeah.
What, you would stand like that
in the corner, facing that way?

16:51.440 --> 16:53.840
It's... It's just how I stand.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.080
That's not how you stand.
Stay out of this, Jonathan!

16:56.120 --> 16:58.040
Are you lying to us, Sidney? No.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.400
No-one in the history
of standing and pressing buttons

17:00.440 --> 17:03.840
has ever stood like that and pressed
a button that way, Sidney.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.920
Well, maybe I was sitting down.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.920
Maybe I was...
I could've maybe been like that.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.880
(What do you think?)

17:17.640 --> 17:19.880
HE SIGHS DEEPLY

17:20.920 --> 17:22.960
Well, you're all free to go.
Thanks for coming.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.280
Not you, Steak and Kidney.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.600
You're coming for a nice ride
in the van.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.640
Is this because of the button thing?

Did I tell you about Josie
from school?No.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.680
She has been

17:48.720 --> 17:50.960
running about with that Tony.
Hello?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.920
What?
What, Tony with the small eyes?

17:53.960 --> 17:57.040
I heard from Sally
that he is good friends with John.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.960
OK. What, John her ex?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.920
They met at their engagement party
two years ago.

18:00.960 --> 18:06.400
Tash, he's obviously had his
small eyes on her this whole time!

18:06.440 --> 18:07.600
That's what I heard.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.640
Tash, I'm telling you a story.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.320
Gimme a sec.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.520
It's Sidney. He's at the station.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.160
What? I knew this would happen!
Can we just give it all back?

18:20.200 --> 18:23.400
What, you're gonna go
to the police station and hand in
three tons of gold? No!

18:23.440 --> 18:26.920
Like, maybe just wait till
after hours and go to the doorstep

18:26.960 --> 18:30.640
and just leave it there with
a letter saying I'm really sorry?

18:30.680 --> 18:33.960
We should've just taken the cash
instead of the gold.
Doesn't matter now, does it?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.280
Because if he grasses,
then we're all fucked.

18:36.320 --> 18:40.680
Literally, up the arse, because
they love doing that in prison.
You, as well. It's not just the men.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.160
Women... I mean, I don't know
if it's up the arse
or whatever your version is, but...

18:44.200 --> 18:47.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's OK. Yeah.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.360
It's OK.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.080
Look at me. Yeah.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.440
No-one's getting fucked up the arse.
Promise? Mm-hm.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.440
Right.

19:09.480 --> 19:13.360
What's that you got there? I think
we need to start taping interviews.
Do what?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.640
So you can listen to everything
I've said in there? Well, yeah.
You're mad, ain't ya?

19:16.680 --> 19:19.000
Not on my watch, girl.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.640
You don't wanna record this,
trust me. It's gonna be
a brutal couple of hours.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.760
I think we need to be delicate
on how we approach him.
We don't want him to clam up.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.960
Look, you go in there being
all delicate with your questions

19:29.000 --> 19:31.840
and your lovely little fringe
and your plum jacket,

19:31.880 --> 19:34.040
he'll play you like a fool.

19:34.080 --> 19:38.840
You see, men like Steak and Kidney,
they're not intimidated by Old Bill.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.680
They're intimidated by brute force.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.160
He seemed pretty intimidated
earlier.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.440
When I'm finished
with that long streak of piss,

19:45.480 --> 19:48.160
he'll be curled up on the floor
in the foetal position,

19:48.200 --> 19:50.440

before I joined the police force,
Sidney?

20:03.720 --> 20:05.400

20:10.280 --> 20:12.640
And I broke many a man.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.680
Harder than you. Tougher than you.

What, really?

20:32.720 --> 20:35.080
But I want total anonymity.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.960
Don't mess me around, son!
Do you understand?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I just said
I'd give you the information!

20:46.040 --> 20:50.560
When I want shit from you,
I will squeeze your fucking head!

20:50.600 --> 20:52.640
Now start talking!

20:52.680 --> 20:56.640
I'm confused because I've just
said I'll give you the names,
and this all seems very unnecessary.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.200
Start talking!
Write all the names down now!

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
Well, have you got a pencil or...?

21:01.280 --> 21:03.400
Don't mess with me, Sidney,

21:03.440 --> 21:07.680
cos I'm gonna open you up
like a tin of plum tomatoes.

21:07.720 --> 21:12.360
It would be easier if I had a table
to write on, so I'm just...

21:13.240 --> 21:15.240
That's all the names.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.240
You've done the right thing there,
boy.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.520
We've decided to accept your offer.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.480
We'll take the cash. But... But...

21:33.520 --> 21:36.600
..we want protection. Protection.

21:36.640 --> 21:41.080
And we want a guarantee that you
and your boys will leave us alone
forever. Forever!

21:41.120 --> 21:43.320
Yeah, I'm still not sold
on the repeating thing.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.320
It just throws it off a little bit.
You don't like it? I liked it.
I thought it was dramatic.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.400
I thought it was good.
One thing, though,

21:49.440 --> 21:51.480
I'm gonna still be
working with them,

21:51.520 --> 21:55.000
so that's something that we do need
to iron out in the small print.
Yeah.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.240
I think it's a no-brainer, though,
innit? They're getting the gold,
so they should go for it.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.520
I'm just gonna say it now,

22:00.560 --> 22:03.640
does anyone else here think
we're getting the fuzzy end
of the lollipop?

22:03.680 --> 22:05.800
Like we could be asking
for more cash? Yes.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.960
Not this again.
I feel like it's fine how it is.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.800
No, that's a good point.
Maybe I could chuck in a promotion.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.040
Let's sort the deal out
and then maybe jump in after that.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.360
What are you boys thinking about
the pacing? I like it personally.

22:18.400 --> 22:22.760
It's disorientating, like there's
a fly in the room and you're just
trying to, "Where is it?"

22:22.800 --> 22:25.240
Right, OK, but apart from that,
we're all agreed, OK,

22:25.280 --> 22:29.080
stick to the plan, cut all ties
and we'll take the cash. OK?

22:29.120 --> 22:30.200
Deal.
