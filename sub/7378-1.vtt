01:07.710 --> 01:10.335
<i>It's like everything
changed in the blink of an eye.</i>

01:10.460 --> 01:12.168
<i>One moment we were fine,</i>

01:12.793 --> 01:15.168
<i>then everything turned to shit.</i>

01:24.835 --> 01:26.793
My little one...

01:27.460 --> 01:30.001
I'm going to miss you all.

01:31.293 --> 01:32.293
Look at me.

01:34.418 --> 01:37.626
We'll write to each other.
You have my address,

01:37.751 --> 01:38.876
don't you?

01:39.918 --> 01:41.918
Then everything's fine.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.001
Off you go.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.626
We'll all miss you, Teacher Dilek.

02:02.585 --> 02:06.085
- Good luck in Istanbul.
- Give your mother my best.

02:07.626 --> 02:08.710
Have a good holiday, Miss.

02:11.918 --> 02:13.251
You're all sad.

02:16.668 --> 02:17.668
Come here.

02:22.043 --> 02:23.210
Selma,

02:23.335 --> 02:25.626
the sun's out, let's walk.

02:38.293 --> 02:39.418
Lale!

02:50.251 --> 02:51.418
Don't splash me!

03:11.460 --> 03:12.626
Ready?

03:34.918 --> 03:36.001
Stop it!

03:43.043 --> 03:44.085
We win!

03:44.585 --> 03:45.710
What?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.251
- My turn again!
- No way.

03:48.376 --> 03:49.668
I want another go.

03:50.210 --> 03:51.376
No way!

03:52.460 --> 03:53.918
You cheated.

03:55.043 --> 03:56.501
No, we didn't.

03:59.126 --> 04:00.501
It's not fair.

04:00.626 --> 04:03.043
- You cheated!
- No, we never!

04:03.168 --> 04:04.501
Give her another go.

04:04.626 --> 04:06.251
Everyone gets just one go.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.168
Take your turn!

04:10.418 --> 04:11.543
Let me go!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.085
Let me go!

04:47.835 --> 04:49.251
I can't reach.

04:59.293 --> 05:01.126
I was going to help you.

05:07.876 --> 05:10.585
Look, they've grown all of a sudden!

05:12.960 --> 05:14.376
Show me your boobs.

05:16.751 --> 05:20.251
What are you doing in my garden!
Clear off!

05:20.376 --> 05:22.501
We've only taken a few apples.

05:25.335 --> 05:26.668
Get out of my garden!

05:26.793 --> 05:28.835
- OK, we're going.
- Calm down.

05:49.210 --> 05:50.210
Sonay,

05:50.835 --> 05:52.460
as you're the eldest,

05:53.126 --> 05:54.876
I'll start with you.

05:55.210 --> 05:56.210
Grandma!

05:57.960 --> 05:58.710
Sonay!

05:58.835 --> 06:01.001
Grandma, open the door!

06:01.126 --> 06:02.126
Grandma?

06:03.210 --> 06:04.293
Sonay, are you OK?

06:06.668 --> 06:08.168
Your turn now.

06:08.293 --> 06:09.293
Selma!

06:11.001 --> 06:12.335
Open the door!

06:12.460 --> 06:13.960
Grandma, open up!

06:15.751 --> 06:18.043
Grandma, open the door!

06:25.210 --> 06:27.335
- Get out!
- What's this all about?

06:27.460 --> 06:30.168
- Ece, come here.
- What did we do?

06:32.001 --> 06:33.876
It was just a few apples.

06:34.001 --> 06:37.001
Everyone's talking
about your obscene behaviour.

06:37.126 --> 06:38.168
What?

06:38.293 --> 06:40.585
Rubbing up against boys' necks.

06:40.710 --> 06:41.835
What?

06:41.960 --> 06:43.376
On the beach.

06:44.001 --> 06:46.710
Rubbing your parts on boys' necks!

06:46.835 --> 06:49.793
We were on their shoulders,
it was a game...

06:49.918 --> 06:51.751
There's no such game!

06:51.876 --> 06:53.376
Who told you this?

06:53.501 --> 06:55.418
- Ece, come here.
- Who told you?

06:55.543 --> 06:56.585
Come here!

06:58.543 --> 07:03.210
Mrs Petek called me
to tell me what you were up to.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.793
How could she?

07:04.918 --> 07:07.918
My granddaughters,
pleasuring themselves on boys' necks!

07:08.043 --> 07:09.335
What?

07:11.460 --> 07:12.668
You're depraved!

07:12.793 --> 07:14.418
Come here!

07:14.751 --> 07:15.751
Get out!

07:15.835 --> 07:18.043
I can't watch you all day long.

07:18.168 --> 07:19.710
You're disgusting!

07:20.626 --> 07:21.710
Get back!

07:22.543 --> 07:24.210
Grandma, stop it!

07:27.418 --> 07:29.126
Nur, what are you doing?

07:39.585 --> 07:40.751
What are you doing?

07:41.251 --> 07:44.210
These chairs touched our arseholes!
That's disgusting!

07:44.335 --> 07:45.793
Have you gone mad?

07:46.501 --> 07:47.501
Come here!

07:48.251 --> 07:49.251
Come back!

07:54.085 --> 07:55.460
Mrs Petek!

08:16.543 --> 08:17.668
Girls!

08:17.793 --> 08:19.918
Mrs Petek's at the market.

08:24.376 --> 08:25.501
Lale!

08:27.626 --> 08:28.793
Mrs Petek!

08:29.460 --> 08:34.001
Do your shit-coloured clothes
make you everyone's moral judge?

08:34.126 --> 08:35.626
What are you doing?

08:40.585 --> 08:42.168
I did it for your own good.

08:42.293 --> 08:43.376
No.

08:43.501 --> 08:44.668
Yes.

08:45.335 --> 08:47.168
I'm sorry, Mrs Petek.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.001
Please forgive them.

08:53.376 --> 08:54.585
Straight home!

08:55.543 --> 08:56.668
Now!

08:58.501 --> 09:00.293
What am I going to do with you?

09:09.751 --> 09:11.001
That's enough, Mum.

09:11.126 --> 09:12.126
Enough!

09:12.668 --> 09:14.876
You've been saying that for years.

09:15.251 --> 09:18.876
"Give them their freedom,
they're just children."

09:19.001 --> 09:21.585
- It's true.
- What's true?

09:21.710 --> 09:25.418
Their parents have been dead
a decade now.

09:26.043 --> 09:29.418
- Be more understanding...
- About what?

09:29.543 --> 09:30.626
They've grown up.

09:31.043 --> 09:32.335
Can't you see?

09:32.460 --> 09:34.293
You know what people are saying?

09:34.418 --> 09:36.501
Don't listen to gossip.

09:36.626 --> 09:38.335
Do you know what they do?

09:38.460 --> 09:40.626
You think you're helping them?

09:41.585 --> 09:44.210
How can you talk like this
to your own mother?

09:44.335 --> 09:45.585
I'll show them!

09:45.960 --> 09:47.251
Where are they?

09:47.751 --> 09:49.210
Watch your language.

09:49.335 --> 09:51.001
Lale, Nur, out!

09:51.126 --> 09:52.210
Out!

09:53.418 --> 09:54.418
Calm down.

09:55.085 --> 09:56.710
Which one is it?

09:56.835 --> 09:59.168
- Calm down.
- Or is it all of you?

09:59.293 --> 10:00.960
- Which one?
- Calm down.

10:01.085 --> 10:04.168
Which one acts like a whore?
Or is it all of you?

10:04.293 --> 10:07.293
Teasing the boys, eh?
Is it you?

10:14.710 --> 10:15.710
Mum!

10:17.043 --> 10:20.251
- They've done nothing wrong!
- How do you know?

10:20.376 --> 10:23.668
- I know.
- How can you be so sure?

10:24.043 --> 10:26.960
They're my granddaughters.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.501
If they're sullied, it's your fault.

10:30.085 --> 10:31.543
I'll prove it to you.

10:32.335 --> 10:33.585
Calm down.

10:33.918 --> 10:36.876
They've always done just what they want.

10:37.001 --> 10:40.376
- How can you fix that?
- Do you think it's easy?

10:40.501 --> 10:42.835
I lost my sons.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.501
I understand.
But it was a long time ago now.

10:46.626 --> 10:48.168
Pull yourself together.

10:48.293 --> 10:51.001
I've raised them
by myself for years.

10:51.126 --> 10:53.710
I understand.

10:53.835 --> 10:56.210
But Erol is right.

10:56.585 --> 10:58.793
He has every reason to be angry.

10:59.335 --> 11:02.335
It's come to this
because you didn't do your job right.

11:19.335 --> 11:22.835
What are you looking at?
Spit out that gum!

11:34.251 --> 11:37.001
Ece, Sonay, Selma, come with me.

11:48.710 --> 11:49.710
Selma.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.168
- What did they do?
- A virginity report.

11:53.293 --> 11:54.418
What's that?

11:54.543 --> 11:57.335
- Did you strip naked for the doctor?
- Yes.

11:57.460 --> 12:01.376
He said I had nothing
he hadn't seen before.

12:01.501 --> 12:03.376
It's true.

12:03.751 --> 12:05.501
We're all made the same.

12:06.376 --> 12:09.710
No. You've got one boob
bigger than the other!

12:38.251 --> 12:40.501
We didn't need to go to the doctor's.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.210
We told you.

12:42.876 --> 12:44.793
If there was the slightest doubt,

12:44.918 --> 12:47.085
you'd never be able to get married.

12:51.460 --> 12:55.251
<i>After that, the doors to the house
were always locked.</i>

13:09.501 --> 13:12.793
<i>Anything likely to pervert us
was banned.</i>

13:56.960 --> 13:58.418
What?

13:58.960 --> 14:00.335
Which road?

14:01.085 --> 14:02.335
All right.

14:06.043 --> 14:07.626
The bastards!

14:15.418 --> 14:19.251
Mum, will you take these girls in hand,
or do I have to?

14:20.085 --> 14:23.085
<i>Sonay, you're mine</i>

14:37.918 --> 14:40.168
Welcome!

14:42.001 --> 14:45.376
- Jump...
- I'm going to fall!

14:45.501 --> 14:46.918
You won't fall.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.210
She's falling.

14:55.376 --> 14:57.085
My baby's born!

14:59.668 --> 15:00.960
Move your feet!

15:01.085 --> 15:03.126
Your order is here.

15:03.251 --> 15:05.835
Your toe dessert from foot world!

15:07.918 --> 15:11.210
- I didn't order anything.
- It's your order!

15:11.335 --> 15:13.960
There's been a mistake.

15:14.085 --> 15:15.835
A mistake?

15:16.418 --> 15:20.543
Put a vine leaf on your plate...

15:22.626 --> 15:25.210
<i>The house became a wife factory,</i>

15:25.335 --> 15:27.126
<i>that we never came out of.</i>

15:30.418 --> 15:31.876
Watch...

15:32.210 --> 15:36.626
If you overstuff them, they go soft,
which isn't good.

15:36.751 --> 15:38.335
No one likes a soft dolma.

15:38.460 --> 15:40.126
Don't burst the peppers.

15:40.460 --> 15:43.168
It has to be nice and round.

15:43.293 --> 15:45.168
Watch carefully.

15:46.043 --> 15:47.876
Yes, you're doing it well.

15:48.668 --> 15:50.418
That's very good.

15:50.543 --> 15:52.460
There's nothing you can't do.

15:52.793 --> 15:56.376
Keep turning it.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.335
You watched me do it, right?

15:58.460 --> 16:00.543
There, that'll be perfectly round.

16:03.751 --> 16:05.085
Well done.

16:06.793 --> 16:08.168
Shall we show the others?

16:09.043 --> 16:10.168
Straight towards you.

16:12.543 --> 16:16.043
You'll all learn how to do this.

16:16.168 --> 16:18.460
Careful with the knife.

16:19.918 --> 16:22.376
Ece, it's your turn.

16:26.293 --> 16:28.876
Well done, girls.

16:30.918 --> 16:34.210
Spread it out evenly.

17:26.710 --> 17:27.835
Come here.

17:33.335 --> 17:37.543
<i>Now it was our turn to wear
shapeless, shit-coloured dresses.</i>

17:43.543 --> 17:46.251
A few basic principles about soup.

17:46.376 --> 17:49.418
Made from a proper broth,
it has more taste.

17:49.543 --> 17:53.210
You can also improve the flavour
and nutritional value

17:53.335 --> 17:55.668
with certain preparations.

17:59.001 --> 18:00.460
In front of my house!

18:02.335 --> 18:03.501
I'll kill him!

18:08.251 --> 18:10.126
"Sonay, you're mine"?

18:24.293 --> 18:25.585
Lale!

18:26.085 --> 18:28.043
That's enough! Get out!

18:35.751 --> 18:37.501
What are you doing here?

18:44.710 --> 18:47.585
Once the milk
takes on this consistency,

18:47.710 --> 18:50.835
add the sugar and the gum.

18:51.293 --> 18:54.418
A measure of salep...

18:56.668 --> 18:58.751
Pour it into these moulds,

19:00.418 --> 19:01.835
put it in the fridge,

19:01.960 --> 19:03.543
and once it's cooled

19:03.668 --> 19:05.960
you'll have chewing-gum!

19:11.835 --> 19:13.043
I'm going to faint!

19:13.168 --> 19:14.751
Help, I'm stuck!

19:14.876 --> 19:16.335
Hang on...

19:19.626 --> 19:21.043
Watch it!

19:21.168 --> 19:23.751
How are we going
to get the dress back?

19:23.876 --> 19:25.251
Did it fly out?

19:27.835 --> 19:29.210
What's that?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.460
Chewing-gum.

19:30.585 --> 19:32.668
Really? Where did you get it?

19:32.793 --> 19:34.960
- We made it.
- How?

19:43.001 --> 19:45.501
The best chewing-gum ever!

19:47.043 --> 19:48.251
It's a bit sticky.

19:48.376 --> 19:49.376
You know what?

19:49.960 --> 19:52.001
We can improve these dresses.

19:55.668 --> 19:57.085
That's better.

19:57.210 --> 19:59.168
- Nice.
- Tear it a bit more.

19:59.293 --> 20:00.585
All the way up.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.960
Wear it like that.

20:04.085 --> 20:06.293
- Strike a pose!
- Like this?

21:01.543 --> 21:03.001
Ouch, my ear!

21:33.001 --> 21:34.043
Where did you go?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.418
The beach.

21:36.835 --> 21:38.793
What were you doing at the beach?

21:38.918 --> 21:40.585
Mind your own business.

21:55.585 --> 21:57.710
Go and put some clothes on!

21:57.835 --> 22:00.335
It's only us here.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.751
What if your uncles saw you?

22:03.710 --> 22:06.335
They're out. Let me breathe!

22:11.668 --> 22:12.710
Come here!

22:14.085 --> 22:15.710
I'll kill you!

22:20.960 --> 22:22.418
You think it's funny?

22:28.085 --> 22:31.126
Nick my stuff again,
I'll rip your head off!

22:31.251 --> 22:32.251
Take it off!

22:44.376 --> 22:49.001
He lost the third trial
and he wants to appeal again.

22:49.585 --> 22:50.710
What do you want?

22:50.835 --> 22:53.001
To ask you a favour, Uncle.

22:53.126 --> 22:54.210
Yes?

22:56.501 --> 22:59.501
It's the Super League quarter finals
on Friday.

22:59.626 --> 23:00.960
So?

23:01.335 --> 23:03.126
Can I come to the match with you?

23:03.251 --> 23:05.293
Do the others want to come too?

23:05.418 --> 23:07.168
They don't like football.

23:07.585 --> 23:10.126
You can't be among all those men.

23:10.251 --> 23:11.501
I asked Grandma.

23:11.835 --> 23:13.293
She didn't say no.

23:13.418 --> 23:16.626
- What did she say?
- That it's up to you.

23:17.126 --> 23:18.751
That it's up to me?

23:22.043 --> 23:24.460
She knows I've followed
all the matches,

23:24.585 --> 23:27.418
that I know all the teams
and the players.

23:27.543 --> 23:29.293
It'll be my last season.

23:30.001 --> 23:33.710
What does she say about the men
who invaded the pitch on Saturday?

23:33.835 --> 23:35.751
And all the fighting?

23:36.293 --> 23:37.876
It's out of the question.

23:43.043 --> 23:44.418
<i>Shame on him.</i>

23:45.751 --> 23:48.960
<i>Shame on him!
Is that how a man behaves?</i>

23:51.876 --> 23:54.085
<i>Don't get all worked up.</i>

23:54.626 --> 23:58.168
<i>Think of your blood pressure.
Drink some water.</i>

23:58.668 --> 24:01.085
<i>Did you know about his wickedness?</i>

24:03.376 --> 24:05.293
<i>Suzanne, answer me.</i>

24:06.210 --> 24:08.710
<i>Did you know what your son was doing?</i>

24:09.501 --> 24:10.626
<i>No.</i>

24:15.043 --> 24:16.960
Goal!

24:43.751 --> 24:48.126
<i>Following the pitch invasion
which caused the match to be suspended,</i>

24:48.251 --> 24:51.168
<i>the Turkish Football Federation
has announced</i>

24:51.293 --> 24:56.210
<i>that Trabzonspor's match on Friday
will be off-limits to men.</i>

24:58.918 --> 25:01.335
<i>Trabzonspor will be the next team</i>

25:01.460 --> 25:03.793
<i>to play to a solely female crowd.</i>

25:03.918 --> 25:08.043
<i>Women only for the home match
against Galatasaray.</i>

25:09.585 --> 25:13.085
<i>Women know how to support their team</i>

25:13.960 --> 25:16.293
<i>and make plenty of noise...</i>

25:18.668 --> 25:21.710
We have to go to that match!

25:21.835 --> 25:23.585
In your dreams!

25:25.085 --> 25:29.210
<i>The most devoted supporters
are already queuing for their tickets.</i>

25:29.335 --> 25:31.918
<i>I was here at dawn.</i>

25:32.043 --> 25:33.585
<i>- You waited for 4 hours?
- Yes.</i>

25:33.710 --> 25:36.126
<i>I'm grateful to the men!</i>

25:39.043 --> 25:40.043
What's going on?

25:40.126 --> 25:41.501
Coming to the match?

25:41.626 --> 25:44.876
- Are you going?
- All the girls in the village are.

25:45.251 --> 25:47.668
They've organized a bus to take us.

25:47.793 --> 25:49.293
Where does it go from?

25:49.418 --> 25:51.626
In front of the café, at 4.

25:53.918 --> 25:55.460
We'll say we're sick.

25:55.585 --> 25:57.751
They'll think we're in bed.

25:57.876 --> 25:59.210
I'm in!

25:59.793 --> 26:02.126
When did you start liking football?

26:02.251 --> 26:05.585
I don't care about the match,
I want to get the hell out.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.085
We can make heads
to put under the covers.

26:09.210 --> 26:11.043
It hasn't even got any hair!

26:11.168 --> 26:12.335
Quiet!

26:19.876 --> 26:23.043
We can't go that way
in broad daylight.

26:23.168 --> 26:24.751
And it's a long way down.

26:24.876 --> 26:27.710
You're mad! They'll skin us alive.

26:27.835 --> 26:30.835
At least something will happen.

27:12.835 --> 27:15.376
- I'm stuck!
- What do you mean, stuck?

27:15.501 --> 27:18.501
- It hurts!
- Push yourself.

27:18.626 --> 27:20.960
- I can't!
- Why can't you?

27:21.085 --> 27:23.126
- Get out!
- I can't!

27:23.251 --> 27:24.251
Get out!

27:24.376 --> 27:26.710
Lale's got no boobs
so she can get through.

27:26.835 --> 27:30.543
It's not your boobs,
it's your fat bum jammed in there!

27:30.668 --> 27:32.085
Be quiet!

27:32.210 --> 27:33.251
Up here.

27:33.376 --> 27:34.793
Give us a hand.

27:35.335 --> 27:37.335
- Hurry up!
- I've got you.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.210
Can you give me a hand?

27:39.335 --> 27:40.710
Go on, Ece.

27:42.793 --> 27:46.835
- Nur won't get up with her fat bum!
- Shut up, shorty!

27:46.960 --> 27:48.460
Pancake chest!

27:48.585 --> 27:49.835
Don't push!

27:49.960 --> 27:52.168
Come on, Selma, hurry up!

27:57.335 --> 27:59.418
Wait for us!

28:06.168 --> 28:07.251
Stop!

28:23.918 --> 28:25.710
It's all your fault!

28:25.835 --> 28:28.418
If you hadn't been scared
of a fly...

28:28.543 --> 28:30.626
It was a great big wasp!

28:30.751 --> 28:33.043
You can't even walk properly!

28:33.168 --> 28:35.460
Stop it, Lale! She fell.

28:37.460 --> 28:41.126
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

28:41.251 --> 28:44.001
We missed the bus
for the match in Trabzon.

28:44.126 --> 28:46.126
Help us catch it up.

28:46.251 --> 28:48.501
Are you mad? No!

28:48.626 --> 28:50.043
- Take us!
- No way!

28:50.168 --> 28:51.460
- Please!
- No.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.210
Stop!

29:12.335 --> 29:13.876
Thank you so much.

30:40.126 --> 30:42.168
Erol, the cable's too short.

30:42.293 --> 30:45.210
Are we going to miss the match
because of a cable?

31:00.168 --> 31:01.418
What's the matter?

31:19.835 --> 31:21.543
What the hell?

31:26.460 --> 31:29.376
There's light at Durmus Emmi's.

31:29.501 --> 31:31.043
We'll drink here after.

31:31.626 --> 31:35.293
<i>I only found out later
what Aunt Emine did for us.</i>

32:08.001 --> 32:09.210
Quiet!

32:13.168 --> 32:16.543
<i>The fallout from our escape
wasn't what we expected.</i>

32:17.251 --> 32:18.751
Stand up straight.

32:19.835 --> 32:22.168
Put your sleeves down.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.668
Show your face.

32:27.793 --> 32:29.543
That's good.

32:29.668 --> 32:32.876
Your hair needs fixing.

32:35.418 --> 32:36.793
Done it?

32:37.251 --> 32:38.376
Ready?

32:38.501 --> 32:41.501
We're going out for lemonade.

33:05.293 --> 33:07.501
Don't drag your feet.

33:19.668 --> 33:21.335
We'll sit here.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.585
Come here a second.

33:25.335 --> 33:26.710
Wait...

33:27.210 --> 33:29.376
Walk over to the fountain
and back again.

33:29.501 --> 33:31.168
What for?

33:31.293 --> 33:34.793
Just go and walk
while I order the lemonade.

33:45.626 --> 33:47.668
She wants us to drink here?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.418
It's a foot fountain!

34:02.835 --> 34:04.918
<i>Grandma started by showing us off.</i>

34:10.793 --> 34:13.251
<i>A few days later some workers came.</i>

34:19.710 --> 34:22.668
Press down hard on the rug.
Lale, do you hear me?

34:26.626 --> 34:30.418
Couldn't you have talked to me
about it first?

34:30.543 --> 34:33.668
You're not always here.
I called the workers.

34:33.793 --> 34:35.626
They're raising the walls a bit.

34:37.126 --> 34:40.293
<i>Now the house
really did look like a prison.</i>

34:48.210 --> 34:50.335
Get this ball out of here!

34:50.460 --> 34:51.751
Play somewhere else!

35:16.210 --> 35:18.543
Grandma, we've got visitors.

35:19.085 --> 35:20.085
Visitors?

35:20.376 --> 35:21.460
Do your hair.

35:21.585 --> 35:23.668
And go get dressed.

35:23.793 --> 35:25.210
Sonay? Selma?

35:26.293 --> 35:29.376
Look how you're dressed!
Put some clothes on!

35:29.501 --> 35:31.751
Bare feet too!

35:31.876 --> 35:35.376
Hurry, Lale,
you come and get dressed too.

35:35.501 --> 35:36.668
Quick, quick, quick!

35:38.210 --> 35:41.126
It's so hard to raise children nowadays.

35:41.251 --> 35:43.335
That's true.

35:47.793 --> 35:48.960
Here she is.

35:49.585 --> 35:52.335
God bless her, she's beautiful!

35:53.626 --> 35:54.876
She's one of a kind!

35:55.710 --> 35:59.043
Sonay, will you serve the tea?

35:59.168 --> 36:00.876
Grandma, I want a word.

36:03.251 --> 36:04.668
Excuse me, please.

36:08.293 --> 36:09.710
I love Ekin.

36:09.835 --> 36:13.376
If you try to marry me off
to anyone else, I'll scream.

36:13.501 --> 36:14.835
What?

36:18.376 --> 36:19.418
All right!

36:19.751 --> 36:21.543
All right, all right.

36:21.668 --> 36:25.751
But if you want to see him again,
he'll have to ask for your hand.

36:31.251 --> 36:34.710
Finally Selma will serve the tea.

36:35.751 --> 36:37.501
A beautiful girl too.

36:37.626 --> 36:39.210
You like her?

36:39.626 --> 36:41.043
Yes, God bless her.

36:41.168 --> 36:42.835
She's one of a kind too.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.043
Go on, serve the tea.

36:47.085 --> 36:50.751
Osman, the lady's son,
has just done his military service.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.335
I'd love all my granddaughters
to be married

36:54.460 --> 36:56.501
while I'm still alive.

36:57.460 --> 37:00.293
What is the young man doing now?

37:01.710 --> 37:03.251
Welcome, Osman.

37:03.585 --> 37:04.626
Thank you.

37:06.418 --> 37:08.168
Come and sit here.

37:13.043 --> 37:14.501
Do you know each other?

37:15.335 --> 37:16.376
By sight.

37:17.793 --> 37:19.376
How are you?

37:19.918 --> 37:21.210
Good, thanks. And you?

37:21.335 --> 37:22.876
Very well, thank you.

37:25.585 --> 37:27.251
Do you like her, Osman?

37:27.835 --> 37:30.918
They're still so young and shy.

37:31.043 --> 37:33.335
But they'll grow fond of one another.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.251
With time, God willing.

37:36.376 --> 37:39.876
Shall we ask the men to join us?

37:40.001 --> 37:44.126
To settle the matter.

37:44.501 --> 37:45.710
Right now?

37:46.126 --> 37:47.376
Why not?

37:48.876 --> 37:52.501
The children seem to like each other.

37:57.626 --> 37:58.668
Welcome.

37:58.793 --> 38:00.376
Good evening.

38:01.418 --> 38:04.085
Go and fetch some more chairs.

38:06.793 --> 38:10.210
I understand the children
have taken a liking to each other.

38:10.335 --> 38:11.668
The women are agreed.

38:11.793 --> 38:13.835
I ask, with God's blessing
and the word of the Prophet,

38:13.960 --> 38:16.460
for your daughter's hand
for our son.

38:17.210 --> 38:19.126
Very well. It's agreed.

38:19.251 --> 38:20.251
It's agreed.

38:23.043 --> 38:24.251
Osman, your ring.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.376
Congratulations!

38:31.710 --> 38:33.668
<i>At least that was settled.</i>

38:34.001 --> 38:35.668
<i>And while we were at it...</i>

38:35.793 --> 38:38.626
We could watch some matches together.

38:39.710 --> 38:41.293
Who do you support?

38:42.501 --> 38:44.126
The national team!

38:50.585 --> 38:51.710
Do you drink alcohol?

38:52.710 --> 38:53.793
No.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.626
I ask, with God's blessing

39:01.335 --> 39:02.876
and the word of the Prophet,

39:03.001 --> 39:05.043
for the hand of your daughter

39:05.168 --> 39:09.751
for our son,
with your full consent.

39:10.126 --> 39:13.001
If God wills it,
we have nothing to say.

39:13.126 --> 39:14.835
<i>Two down.</i>

39:16.335 --> 39:19.293
Lale, I have to take
your measurements too.

39:47.126 --> 39:49.251
- Grandma...
- Yes, my child?

39:49.376 --> 39:50.751
Where do I put these?

39:50.876 --> 39:54.918
In Sonay's chest.
Those are Selma's.

39:55.043 --> 39:57.543
We'll keep these for Ece's wedding.

39:57.668 --> 40:00.293
- Ece's wedding?
- Of course.

40:02.585 --> 40:04.710
<i>All About Sex</i>

40:08.960 --> 40:12.501
Do I really have to sleep with Osman?

40:12.626 --> 40:14.085
Straight away?

40:14.210 --> 40:17.960
Why are you so worried?
You're not a virgin?

40:18.085 --> 40:19.668
Of course I am!

40:20.168 --> 40:21.710
You can tell me.

40:21.835 --> 40:23.168
No, honestly.

40:23.710 --> 40:24.710
Listen...

40:26.668 --> 40:31.126
Me and Ekin make love
but I'm still a virgin.

40:31.251 --> 40:32.418
How?

40:33.001 --> 40:34.126
We do it the back way.

40:34.751 --> 40:36.251
The back way?

40:36.376 --> 40:40.626
So I stay a virgin
and no chance I'll get pregnant.

41:01.418 --> 41:08.210
<i>If my mother had a boat,
she'd sail it to me</i>

41:16.501 --> 41:21.918
<i>If my father had a horse,
he'd ride it to me</i>

41:32.501 --> 41:36.085
<i>If my brothers and sisters
knew where I am</i>

41:36.210 --> 41:38.126
<i>They'd come looking for me...</i>

41:42.501 --> 41:43.835
They're coming!

41:44.501 --> 41:45.960
Come on, girls!

41:46.668 --> 41:48.043
They're here!

41:49.168 --> 41:50.418
Get ready.

41:50.543 --> 41:51.751
Where are the veils?

42:02.960 --> 42:03.960
Sonay!

42:05.876 --> 42:07.543
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

42:07.668 --> 42:09.960
Put your veil on, they're here.

42:10.085 --> 42:11.501
Where's the veil?

42:12.085 --> 42:13.501
Hurry up!

42:15.085 --> 42:16.085
Hanife!

42:16.210 --> 42:18.210
Put her veil on, quick!

42:19.751 --> 42:20.960
Erol?

42:21.960 --> 42:23.751
Are you coming?

42:36.835 --> 42:39.001
- Welcome.
- Wait a minute!

42:39.126 --> 42:40.376
Wait.

42:40.501 --> 42:42.210
At a wedding,

42:42.335 --> 42:45.043
the girl's family plays hard to get.

42:45.168 --> 42:47.501
Sit on those chests, girls.

42:48.001 --> 42:49.751
Don't give yourselves up too easily.

42:49.876 --> 42:52.168
Now we're playing hard to get?

42:55.293 --> 42:56.418
My love!

44:45.960 --> 44:47.335
What's the matter?

44:51.710 --> 44:54.376
If you don't want to marry Osman,
run away.

44:54.501 --> 44:55.710
How?

44:56.543 --> 44:57.876
Just get in a car and go.

44:58.835 --> 45:00.126
Where?

45:00.251 --> 45:02.585
To Istanbul, like everyone.

45:03.085 --> 45:04.960
It's 1000 km away.

45:05.835 --> 45:08.085
And I can't drive.

45:16.085 --> 45:17.168
Goodbye.

45:17.543 --> 45:19.835
Stop it, you'll make me cry.

45:26.126 --> 45:29.293
<i>It was the last time
we were all together.</i>

46:44.043 --> 46:46.293
- Did it hurt?
<i>- Yes.</i>

46:46.668 --> 46:49.085
- What was it like?
<i>- Bumpy.</i>

46:49.210 --> 46:52.668
<i>Aunt Emine said it'd be hard at first,</i>

46:52.793 --> 46:55.418
<i>but that I'd get used to it.</i>

46:55.543 --> 46:57.001
Did you bleed a lot?

46:57.126 --> 46:58.460
<i>Not at all.</i>

47:00.043 --> 47:01.710
Osman, my son, we're waiting.

47:10.376 --> 47:13.085
Osman, are you going
to show us the sheet?

47:25.293 --> 47:26.460
Coming!

47:28.085 --> 47:30.168
I swear I'm a virgin.

47:31.293 --> 47:33.918
- So where's the blood?
- I don't know.

47:36.543 --> 47:38.543
Show us the sheet.

47:38.668 --> 47:39.751
Just a minute!

47:39.876 --> 47:41.835
What do I tell them?

47:43.710 --> 47:44.960
Where is it?

47:56.960 --> 47:58.126
Good evening.

47:59.251 --> 48:03.168
We just married our son
and the girl didn't bleed.

48:10.460 --> 48:13.376
Your husband doesn't seem very romantic.

48:13.501 --> 48:15.168
I don't know him that well.

48:21.001 --> 48:23.960
You weren't a virgin, then?

48:25.960 --> 48:28.418
That'll stay between us.

48:37.918 --> 48:39.918
I slept with the entire world.

49:15.001 --> 49:16.126
Are you sure?

49:17.085 --> 49:20.793
- About what?
- Sleeping with the entire world.

49:20.918 --> 49:23.751
I must have slept with someone
and forgotten.

49:23.876 --> 49:26.418
- Your hymen's right here.
- How?

49:26.543 --> 49:29.626
It happens.
It's just the way you're made.

49:29.751 --> 49:34.168
It'll break sometime.
With your husband, or giving birth.

49:34.293 --> 49:36.876
But I can see it there.

49:37.001 --> 49:39.501
It wouldn't have resisted
"the entire world"!

49:39.626 --> 49:42.210
Why do you say things like that?

49:46.751 --> 49:48.210
I don't know.

49:48.335 --> 49:50.293
It's late.

49:50.918 --> 49:52.168
I'm tired.

49:52.876 --> 49:56.543
When I say I'm a virgin,
no one believes me.

49:57.126 --> 49:59.251
Why won't you all leave me alone?

50:25.001 --> 50:26.001
What's going on?

50:26.126 --> 50:28.501
They've come to ask for Ece's hand.

50:33.168 --> 50:36.251
Tell them,
"You want coffee? Get it yourself!"

50:36.376 --> 50:38.501
Then slam the door and go.

50:38.626 --> 50:39.918
Open this.

50:40.043 --> 50:42.835
Did they bring it?

50:45.335 --> 50:48.168
Lale, what are you doing?

50:53.543 --> 50:56.251
I'll slap you! Get out!

50:56.376 --> 50:58.918
Don't walk on the biscuits!

50:59.918 --> 51:01.501
Put that salt down!

51:15.001 --> 51:16.001
Be quiet!

51:20.418 --> 51:21.626
Don't push me.

51:24.168 --> 51:26.460
Ece is one of a kind.

51:26.585 --> 51:28.751
She's so helpful.

51:28.876 --> 51:30.001
Thank you.

51:30.126 --> 51:31.418
Elegant...

51:31.543 --> 51:34.793
<i>When it was Ece's turn,
at first she went along with it.</i>

51:37.168 --> 51:40.460
<i>Then she started behaving dangerously.</i>

53:00.126 --> 53:02.418
Another match?
Where are you going?

53:02.543 --> 53:03.668
I'm leaving.

53:03.793 --> 53:04.835
Going where?

53:06.460 --> 53:07.835
Istanbul.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.293
On foot?

53:10.335 --> 53:12.793
Get in, I'll take you home.

53:12.918 --> 53:14.085
No way.

53:14.210 --> 53:15.293
You're right.

53:15.418 --> 53:19.376
It'll only take you
about nine or ten days.

53:20.835 --> 53:22.585
And you're in luck.

53:22.710 --> 53:26.376
Muddy slippers
are all the rage in Istanbul.

53:34.918 --> 53:36.126
Open up!

53:40.751 --> 53:44.960
<i>Maybe it was the fresh air, but it felt
like returning to the nut-house.</i>

53:45.710 --> 53:48.418
<i>I used to kiss
the soles of my mum's feet.</i>

53:48.543 --> 53:50.251
<i>She made a fuss about it.</i>

53:50.376 --> 53:52.543
<i>I said,
"Mum, don't pull your feet away.</i>

53:52.668 --> 53:55.251
<i>"That's the fragrance of paradise."</i>

53:55.376 --> 53:58.793
<i>Sometimes she cried.
That's how mothers are.</i>

53:59.876 --> 54:01.251
Coming for a swim?

54:02.251 --> 54:04.751
Easy! You'll end up
a fat cow at your wedding!

54:07.001 --> 54:08.751
<i>Some will understand, others won't.</i>

54:08.876 --> 54:13.585
<i>Feminists won't.
They refuse motherhood.</i>

54:13.710 --> 54:14.918
One,

54:15.043 --> 54:16.585
two, three!

54:18.793 --> 54:20.543
I'm going to dive under the water.

54:26.001 --> 54:27.626
Don't spit at me!

54:33.876 --> 54:35.710
I'm down really deep.

54:37.043 --> 54:38.710
Lale, where are you?

54:41.376 --> 54:43.085
I'm coming to find you.

54:50.626 --> 54:53.418
Look, I found a seashell.

54:55.210 --> 54:56.293
Listen.

54:57.960 --> 55:01.501
Not in front of my door!
You've put bars everywhere.

55:03.335 --> 55:05.501
Aren't you coming back to school?

56:51.751 --> 56:54.918
I'm going to the bank. Stay here.

57:11.001 --> 57:12.168
What's that?

57:20.418 --> 57:23.210
- Shall I beat those boys up?
- No.

57:23.335 --> 57:25.876
Hang them up by their feet?

57:26.001 --> 57:27.251
No, don't bother.

57:29.168 --> 57:30.501
Where are you going?

57:30.626 --> 57:31.751
Across the street.

57:41.751 --> 57:45.210
<i>Güven Travel
Istanbul, Ankara, Samsun</i>

58:17.251 --> 58:19.460
Warn me when Erol comes back.

58:40.835 --> 58:43.335
Why are you out of the car?

58:43.460 --> 58:46.793
Now we're here,
can we have an ice-cream?

58:46.918 --> 58:49.126
We don't have time.

58:52.251 --> 58:53.376
Later.

59:18.460 --> 59:21.251
I leave you two minutes
and everybody's out.

59:21.376 --> 59:23.918
And why did you close the windows?

59:38.168 --> 59:39.251
Ece?

59:43.876 --> 59:44.876
I want you!

59:49.376 --> 59:51.293
Is that you, Ece?

59:55.376 --> 59:57.543
It's the guy who got in the car.

59:57.668 --> 01:00:00.751
I've been talking to my mates
about you all night.

01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:05.751
Come into my arms, Ece!

01:00:08.043 --> 01:00:09.460
I want you!

01:00:10.001 --> 01:00:11.085
Idiot!

01:00:15.418 --> 01:00:16.626
Did he follow us?

01:00:16.751 --> 01:00:18.793
How does he know where we live?

01:00:19.335 --> 01:00:20.418
I told him.

01:00:20.543 --> 01:00:23.168
Erol, do you hear that?

01:00:23.876 --> 01:00:26.001
There are people in the garden.

01:00:26.126 --> 01:00:27.710
Go and see.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.210
Are you mad?

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.460
Get the hell out of here!

01:00:49.918 --> 01:00:50.960
Girls?

01:01:26.793 --> 01:01:27.793
Stop!

01:01:35.335 --> 01:01:38.043
Teach me how to drive a car.

01:01:38.168 --> 01:01:39.751
I've tried loads of times.

01:01:39.876 --> 01:01:43.168
I press down, the engine revs
but it doesn't move.

01:01:43.293 --> 01:01:45.543
Show me how to do it.

01:01:46.043 --> 01:01:49.960
I could get in big trouble
hanging about with you.

01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:50.918
And me?

01:01:51.043 --> 01:01:53.626
You think I should be here with you?

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:55.751
Turn the wheel...

01:01:56.418 --> 01:01:57.460
Nice and gently.

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:02.251
Come off the brake.

01:02:03.126 --> 01:02:04.126
Well done.

01:02:07.085 --> 01:02:09.293
Don't let the clutch out suddenly.

01:02:11.876 --> 01:02:13.001
Do it gradually.

01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:18.543
Accelerate a bit.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.001
Not all at once!

01:02:22.251 --> 01:02:23.251
That's it.

01:02:23.793 --> 01:02:24.835
What's this?

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.085
The horn.

01:02:29.793 --> 01:02:30.793
Watch it!

01:02:30.918 --> 01:02:33.251
Accelerate. More!

01:02:48.626 --> 01:02:49.710
Very nice.

01:02:50.126 --> 01:02:53.126
Huge progress with your shoes, at least.

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:28.126
<i>Women must be chaste and pure,</i>

01:03:28.251 --> 01:03:30.876
<i>know their limits,</i>

01:03:31.001 --> 01:03:33.335
<i>and mustn't laugh openly in public,</i>

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.835
<i>or be provocative with every move.</i>

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.668
<i>Women must guard their chastity!</i>

01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:45.543
<i>Where are the girls who blush
when you look at them?</i>

01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:53.835
What's this?

01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:56.460
A bunch of these!

01:04:18.001 --> 01:04:20.043
Can you read between the lines?

01:04:27.043 --> 01:04:28.460
What's going on?

01:04:56.376 --> 01:04:57.626
Leave the table.

01:04:58.251 --> 01:04:59.418
Go away!

01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:02.460
All right.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.960
Finish your meal.

01:05:38.751 --> 01:05:40.501
Seref, get the girls away from here!

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.126
Darling, we're going.

01:07:06.543 --> 01:07:08.626
Selma, your husband's waiting too.

01:07:33.918 --> 01:07:35.126
Lale...

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.085
Thank you.

01:08:25.126 --> 01:08:27.292
Don't you want to leave?

01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:28.626
Where to?

01:08:31.626 --> 01:08:33.626
We could go to Istanbul.

01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:35.585
Istanbul...

01:09:08.292 --> 01:09:10.126
I want to get out of here.

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:14.042
If we get caught, they'll murder us.

01:09:14.167 --> 01:09:15.417
We'll do it right.

01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:19.001
No one will know we're gone
until we're far away.

01:10:03.293 --> 01:10:05.501
What have you done to your hair?

01:10:15.335 --> 01:10:16.460
It's hot.

01:10:32.085 --> 01:10:34.835
Get up and take the girls out.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960
They're hot.

01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:19.293
What were you doing?

01:12:21.085 --> 01:12:22.835
I asked you a question!

01:12:25.501 --> 01:12:28.501
Stop that! Stop it right now!

01:12:34.335 --> 01:12:35.460
Not sleeping?

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.210
I was thirsty.

01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:43.918
Not sleeping?

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:45.835
Yes, I am.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:03.043
It's nice to see you
working hard like this.

01:13:03.168 --> 01:13:04.835
You do it really well.

01:13:05.293 --> 01:13:07.043
You're a woman now.

01:13:08.668 --> 01:13:11.001
It'll soon be time for you to marry.

01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:14.210
- What?
- You're a young woman now.

01:13:14.335 --> 01:13:16.168
I got married when I was your age.

01:13:16.293 --> 01:13:18.751
There were special circumstances too.

01:13:18.876 --> 01:13:19.876
Married?

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.085
Me?

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:24.001
- Yes, you.
- Marry who?

01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:28.918
There'll be plenty of suitors
once you're ready.

01:13:29.043 --> 01:13:31.710
I didn't know my husband at all.

01:13:31.835 --> 01:13:33.501
But I grew to love him.

01:13:34.335 --> 01:13:35.918
It'll be the same for you.

01:13:36.043 --> 01:13:37.876
You'll fall in love.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:40.585
You fall in love easily at your age.

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:41.918
You're joking, right?

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:43.710
No.

01:13:48.585 --> 01:13:50.585
Your son has a very good job.

01:13:51.085 --> 01:13:53.251
Nur, sit next to Bülent.

01:13:56.668 --> 01:14:01.168
Bülent will be in the army
for a year and a half.

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:04.793
When you're married,
you'll live with his parents.

01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:07.751
They'll be
like a mother and father to you.

01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:27.168
She won't need that.

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:32.126
She can use this one.

01:15:33.418 --> 01:15:34.460
All ready.

01:17:12.168 --> 01:17:13.251
Welcome.

01:17:15.876 --> 01:17:17.001
Welcome.

01:17:33.126 --> 01:17:35.501
What are you doing?
Open the door!

01:17:35.626 --> 01:17:37.460
We're playing hard to get!

01:17:38.626 --> 01:17:39.626
Girls!

01:17:40.793 --> 01:17:43.501
- What are you doing?
- You want to marry him?

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:44.460
No.

01:17:44.585 --> 01:17:46.876
Then help me move this.

01:17:47.543 --> 01:17:48.751
Open the door!

01:17:55.085 --> 01:17:57.376
Maybe they have a surprise for us.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.210
They should have followed us out.

01:18:03.793 --> 01:18:05.126
Where are you?

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:07.543
Everything's fine, don't worry.

01:18:07.668 --> 01:18:11.293
Let's make ourselves comfortable.
They'll join us later.

01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:14.793
It's all the excitement.
It happens sometimes.

01:18:15.626 --> 01:18:18.335
They'll be out soon, don't worry.

01:18:19.251 --> 01:18:22.043
She's been so looking forward to it.

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:44.960
I'm not marrying that guy!

01:18:45.085 --> 01:18:46.168
What did you say?

01:18:46.293 --> 01:18:48.585
You didn't have to say it like that!

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.251
Keep calm.

01:18:55.376 --> 01:18:56.376
Come here.

01:18:57.585 --> 01:18:58.626
Closer.

01:18:59.585 --> 01:19:01.210
Let's have some music.

01:19:01.335 --> 01:19:02.668
Do what I tell you.

01:19:03.085 --> 01:19:05.293
Open the door now.

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:08.960
Pull yourself together.

01:19:09.085 --> 01:19:10.543
All right, Mum.

01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:13.126
Let's go and sit over there.

01:19:13.251 --> 01:19:15.626
Let's sit down.

01:19:25.793 --> 01:19:26.835
Open the door!

01:19:31.293 --> 01:19:32.293
Come here!

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:33.876
Open the door!

01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:35.001
Open it!

01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:00.835
He's looking for a way in.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.210
Nur, be reasonable.

01:20:24.335 --> 01:20:25.543
Take this.

01:20:27.876 --> 01:20:29.293
Leave me alone.

01:20:29.918 --> 01:20:31.210
Come down.

01:20:31.918 --> 01:20:34.918
I know it's a special day for you.

01:20:35.043 --> 01:20:38.710
No way am I doing stuff like that
with that guy!

01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:42.668
I've never been so humiliated.
The wedding's off!

01:20:42.793 --> 01:20:43.793
Now we agree!

01:20:43.918 --> 01:20:45.501
Be reasonable, Nur.

01:20:46.251 --> 01:20:47.626
There's your dowry!

01:20:55.251 --> 01:20:57.085
<i>I have loads of salesmen.</i>

01:20:57.210 --> 01:20:59.543
His name's Yasin, he has long hair.

01:20:59.668 --> 01:21:02.293
<i>I don't have any queer salesmen.</i>

01:21:05.501 --> 01:21:07.960
Nur, I can see you!

01:21:08.293 --> 01:21:11.918
I'll call the police, you bastard,
and tell them everything!

01:21:12.793 --> 01:21:13.835
Yasin?

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.710
<i>Yes?</i>

01:21:14.835 --> 01:21:17.460
It's Lale.
You have to come and help me.

01:21:17.585 --> 01:21:20.585
We're locked in the house.
They want to kill us.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.043
Yasin?

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.626
I'll kill you!

01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:28.835
Shit!

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.293
They've cut the phone line.

01:21:32.418 --> 01:21:34.418
Do they have their guns?

01:21:49.543 --> 01:21:51.960
I've got Uncle Erol's car keys.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.293
Show yourselves!

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:37.085
Where are you?

01:23:46.126 --> 01:23:47.626
I'll get you!

01:24:36.085 --> 01:24:37.835
- Leave them.
- Let me go!

01:24:38.335 --> 01:24:40.543
They're getting away!

01:24:40.668 --> 01:24:42.335
Leave it to me!

01:24:43.376 --> 01:24:44.710
Erol, don't go.

01:24:46.335 --> 01:24:47.751
Stay there!

01:24:55.543 --> 01:24:56.543
Hurry up!

01:25:02.751 --> 01:25:03.751
Quick!

01:25:57.210 --> 01:25:59.460
If he heard me, he'll come.

01:26:04.835 --> 01:26:06.085
Hide!

01:26:35.543 --> 01:26:37.085
He's not going to come.

01:26:38.418 --> 01:26:39.543
Wait!

01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:48.501
Stop him! That's him!

01:26:52.918 --> 01:26:55.085
Stop, Yasin!

01:30:45.835 --> 01:30:47.085
Big sister.

01:30:48.126 --> 01:30:49.918
Do you know this address?

01:31:36.585 --> 01:31:37.585
Hello?

01:31:37.918 --> 01:31:40.793
I'm looking for my teacher, Miss Dilek.

01:31:42.835 --> 01:31:43.960
Dilek!

01:31:52.918 --> 01:31:53.918
Lale?

01:32:02.043 --> 01:32:03.126
Sweetheart.
