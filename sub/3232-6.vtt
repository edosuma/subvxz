00:39.088 --> 00:41.799
Yo.
-Yo.

00:42.008 --> 00:43.259
What up?

00:43.468 --> 00:44.594
Damn, bitch.

00:49.432 --> 00:53.227
You got something for me?
-Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

00:57.857 --> 01:01.361
Is this a five or an S?
-Five, yo.

01:01.569 --> 01:03.446
No, wait. S.

01:03.654 --> 01:07.533
No, no. Yeah, five.
-Yeah?

01:08.868 --> 01:12.705
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

01:12.914 --> 01:13.956
Hey, man.

01:14.165 --> 01:17.210
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

01:17.418 --> 01:20.171
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.881
Hey.

01:22.090 --> 01:23.800
So they got names?

01:24.008 --> 01:28.262
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

01:28.471 --> 01:30.348
Him, they call Spooge.

01:31.724 --> 01:35.770
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

01:35.978 --> 01:37.897
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked...

01:38.106 --> 01:40.066
...by a guy named Spooge?

01:40.274 --> 01:41.901
Yo, what's his name matter?

01:42.110 --> 01:45.697
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

01:45.905 --> 01:48.533
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing...

01:48.741 --> 01:50.910
Did I say that?
-Because I'll go do it myself.

01:51.119 --> 01:55.415
It's just I'm on probation and all.
-Yeah.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.292
So you gonna do it?

01:59.419 --> 02:00.795
Yeah.

02:01.003 --> 02:03.256
Good. Right on.

02:05.466 --> 02:09.679
Because these two,
they need to get got.

03:39.727 --> 03:43.064
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

03:43.272 --> 03:45.149
Where's my-?

03:45.358 --> 03:50.196
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

03:50.405 --> 03:53.533
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

03:53.741 --> 03:55.326
Where's my money?

03:55.535 --> 03:57.954
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

03:58.162 --> 04:00.289
Come on.

04:04.293 --> 04:07.130
I will mess you up.

04:07.338 --> 04:10.299
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

04:10.508 --> 04:13.052
Your funeral, jack.

04:13.261 --> 04:19.058
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

04:19.267 --> 04:22.060
<i>Yeah, mucho loco.</i>

04:22.270 --> 04:25.398
Do not test me.

04:34.782 --> 04:37.535
Good morning.
-Good morning.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.496
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.794
Looks like it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

04:47.003 --> 04:50.048
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

04:50.256 --> 04:54.385
You have a great day.
-Right on. You too.

05:10.026 --> 05:13.071
God. Shit.

05:45.895 --> 05:49.273
Yo, anybody home?

05:54.070 --> 05:55.113
Hello?

06:50.501 --> 06:56.466
<i>Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...</i>

06:56.674 --> 06:58.926
<i>...tonight in the steel knock out.</i>

06:59.135 --> 07:02.055
<i>Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>

07:02.263 --> 07:04.599
<i>That's 15 easy instalments.</i>

07:04.807 --> 07:07.810
<i>And, folks, the knock out is only-</i>

07:08.019 --> 07:10.772
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

07:10.980 --> 07:13.566
<i>Now, Terry put this one together-</i>

07:13.775 --> 07:16.361
Where's your folks? They here?

07:16.569 --> 07:18.488
<i>-and I'm here to tell you-</i>

07:18.696 --> 07:23.868
<i>Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a...</i>

07:24.660 --> 07:25.912
<i>Already done it.</i>

07:26.120 --> 07:28.247
<i>Tonight, folks...</i>

07:36.631 --> 07:38.591
<i>Do you realise how long it's been...</i>

07:38.800 --> 07:43.388
<i>...since we've offered this sword
in this set?</i>

07:43.596 --> 07:49.936
<i>Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.</i>

07:50.144 --> 07:51.813
<i>It's no wonder-</i>

07:52.021 --> 07:55.108
<i>It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now-</i>

07:55.316 --> 07:56.442
What's your name?

07:56.651 --> 07:59.946
<i>I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm-</i>

08:00.154 --> 08:03.616
My name's Diesel.

08:03.825 --> 08:05.785
<i>-eleven, 12, 13-</i>

08:07.203 --> 08:10.123
<i>-sixteen, 17, 18, 19...</i>

08:10.331 --> 08:12.875
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

08:13.084 --> 08:16.713
<i>Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?</i>

08:16.921 --> 08:21.092
<i>Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.</i>

08:21.300 --> 08:24.262
<i>Folks, custom pieces-</i>

08:29.684 --> 08:33.895
<i>Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...</i>

08:34.105 --> 08:36.357
<i>...but there's a reason for that.</i>

08:36.566 --> 08:41.821
<i>Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.</i>

08:42.030 --> 08:45.658
<i>These knives possess edges like...</i>

08:54.250 --> 08:58.755
So when are your folks
coming home?

08:58.963 --> 09:03.343
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

09:05.845 --> 09:08.181
I'm hungry.

09:13.561 --> 09:15.355
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

09:15.563 --> 09:18.358
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

09:18.566 --> 09:23.529
<i>We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences...</i>

09:23.738 --> 09:26.866
<i>Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.</i>

09:27.075 --> 09:29.911
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

09:33.081 --> 09:35.958
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...</i>

09:36.167 --> 09:38.211
<i>...calling to say hello.</i>

09:38.419 --> 09:41.547
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both...</i>

09:41.756 --> 09:43.007
<i>...hoping everything's well.</i>

09:43.216 --> 09:46.302
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...</i>

09:46.511 --> 09:49.013
<i>...so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

09:49.222 --> 09:51.391
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

09:54.102 --> 09:56.229
<i>-Hello?
-Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>

09:56.437 --> 09:59.899
<i>This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

10:00.108 --> 10:02.235
No. No, not at all.

10:02.443 --> 10:04.904
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

10:05.113 --> 10:06.489
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>

10:07.365 --> 10:11.202
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

10:11.411 --> 10:14.747
<i>...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

10:14.956 --> 10:16.833
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.002
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

10:20.211 --> 10:21.587
That's wonderful.

10:21.796 --> 10:26.634
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

10:26.843 --> 10:30.763
...and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

10:30.972 --> 10:33.224
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant...</i>

10:33.433 --> 10:37.103
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and...

10:37.311 --> 10:40.106
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just-

10:41.024 --> 10:45.737
<i>-What? What is it?
-I can't...</i>

10:45.945 --> 10:49.449
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

10:50.992 --> 10:53.911
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...</i>

10:55.663 --> 10:57.749
It saved us.

11:00.668 --> 11:02.837
I don't know if I...

11:03.046 --> 11:05.798
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

11:06.007 --> 11:08.217
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

11:08.426 --> 11:11.888
To me. And to all of us.

11:12.096 --> 11:14.766
So I just...

11:14.974 --> 11:19.228
...finally wanted to say thank you.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.234
<i>Anyway...</i>

11:26.778 --> 11:27.862
End of speech.

11:28.071 --> 11:30.740
So I do-
I hope we get to see you soon.

11:30.948 --> 11:35.828
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

11:36.829 --> 11:40.875
<i>-How about this afternoon?
-Yeah, okay.</i>

11:43.795 --> 11:47.173
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

11:47.382 --> 11:50.968
...trienes, polyenes.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.639
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.891
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

11:57.100 --> 11:59.352
...and you will...

11:59.560 --> 12:03.690
...just keep in mind
that one element...

12:03.898 --> 12:06.150
...carbon.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.862
Carbon is at the centre of it all.

12:10.071 --> 12:13.825
There is no life without carbon.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.536
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

12:16.744 --> 12:23.668
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

12:25.503 --> 12:26.504
Carmen is carbon.

12:27.380 --> 12:31.676
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

12:33.011 --> 12:34.887
No. Okay.

12:36.264 --> 12:38.516
I like to think of it...

12:39.559 --> 12:43.021
I like to think that the diamond...

12:43.229 --> 12:45.273
...and the woman
who wears it on her finger...

12:45.481 --> 12:48.693
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

12:49.944 --> 12:54.866
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.411
That got your attention, right?

12:58.619 --> 13:02.331
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

13:03.666 --> 13:07.628
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

13:08.838 --> 13:12.759
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

13:12.967 --> 13:15.386
..for making synthetic diamonds.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.764
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

13:17.972 --> 13:23.144
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

13:23.353 --> 13:28.066
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

13:28.274 --> 13:31.861
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

13:32.070 --> 13:37.033
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

13:39.952 --> 13:44.457
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.962
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

14:01.391 --> 14:03.101
Anyway...

14:04.018 --> 14:07.438
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

14:07.647 --> 14:09.190
...paid to a carbon-based man...

14:09.399 --> 14:15.071
...for something
he made out of carbon.

14:17.031 --> 14:18.783
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>

14:20.201 --> 14:22.829
You're looking great, by the way.

14:23.037 --> 14:27.542
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

14:27.750 --> 14:31.004
And then there's the hair thing.
-I actually like that.

14:31.212 --> 14:33.506
That's a great look for you.

14:34.966 --> 14:40.930
But you're feeling good?
-Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

14:41.139 --> 14:43.307
It's...

14:43.516 --> 14:44.976
I'm glad to be back at work.

14:45.184 --> 14:50.064
I'm glad to... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

14:50.273 --> 14:52.275
We're happy too.

14:53.776 --> 14:56.154
And I just...

14:58.031 --> 15:02.326
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

15:05.872 --> 15:09.375
Is everything okay?

15:10.376 --> 15:15.757
Just please feel comfortable
coming to me...

15:15.965 --> 15:20.720
...with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

15:20.928 --> 15:23.848
You know, completely confidential.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.975
Okay?

15:29.937 --> 15:33.232
See you tomorrow, Flynn.
-See you, Jeffrey.

15:34.609 --> 15:36.986
Oh, man.

15:49.665 --> 15:51.417
Let me see it.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.506
Dad, let me see it.
-Don't worry about it.

16:00.134 --> 16:03.054
Hey, let's go.

16:35.837 --> 16:39.132
<i>Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price...</i>

16:41.426 --> 16:42.468
Hey.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.597
Peekaboo.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.145
No?

16:57.150 --> 16:58.568
Peekaboo.

17:02.864 --> 17:04.156
Oh, man.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.328
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

17:11.705 --> 17:14.416
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

17:15.251 --> 17:18.003
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

17:18.212 --> 17:21.089
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

17:23.009 --> 17:29.307
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

17:43.071 --> 17:44.280
Shut up!
-You shut up.

17:44.489 --> 17:46.908
You shut up, you-
-You shut up!

17:47.116 --> 17:49.827
You're the one who dropped it.
-I didn't drop it.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.037
I didn't drop-

17:51.245 --> 17:53.456
Shit! You dropped it.
-Shut the hell up about it.

17:53.664 --> 17:55.041
You shut up!
-You shut up.

17:59.170 --> 18:00.713
Get up.

18:02.674 --> 18:06.386
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

18:25.613 --> 18:30.034
You know who might have done it?
-I have an idea.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.415
Well, here's what I think.

18:35.623 --> 18:40.086
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

18:40.294 --> 18:45.466
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

18:45.675 --> 18:51.055
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.726
Saw it in an old Western.

18:58.146 --> 18:59.814
You with me?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.944
Scorpions?

19:07.488 --> 19:10.116
Scorpions are good.

19:10.533 --> 19:12.410
Yeah.

19:20.043 --> 19:21.294
Nice.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.978
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

19:39.187 --> 19:41.773
Who is this?

20:00.792 --> 20:03.670
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

20:03.878 --> 20:06.005
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

20:06.214 --> 20:08.591
Mom.
-What? I'm just offering the choice.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.302
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.472
Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
-Nice to meet you too.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.848
Oh, Walt.

20:17.725 --> 20:19.477
Look who's here.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.687
Gretchen.
-Hi.

20:20.895 --> 20:23.940
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

20:24.148 --> 20:26.693
Look at you. You're looking good.

20:26.901 --> 20:28.903
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

20:29.112 --> 20:30.613
I know it was for me.

20:30.822 --> 20:34.409
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

20:34.617 --> 20:35.993
May I?
-Oh, sure.

20:36.202 --> 20:39.414
For good luck, right?
-Exactly. Here's hoping.

20:39.622 --> 20:41.249
We could use some of that.
-Yeah.

20:41.457 --> 20:45.712
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

20:46.921 --> 20:51.718
It was a really good thing.
-You're very welcome.

20:51.926 --> 20:55.054
We're gonna find a way to repay you.
-No, no, no.

20:55.263 --> 20:58.391
We don't wanna ever hear that.

20:59.767 --> 21:02.729
You know, I hate to say it...

21:02.937 --> 21:06.065
...but I really need to get going.

21:06.274 --> 21:07.900
Oh, that's too bad.

21:08.109 --> 21:10.153
You can't stay for dinner?
-I wish I could...

21:10.361 --> 21:13.698
...but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

21:13.906 --> 21:14.907
Okay. Okay.

21:15.116 --> 21:19.912
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

21:20.121 --> 21:21.414
Yeah, hopefully.

21:21.622 --> 21:24.459
Gretchen, your purse.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.546
Well, good to see you.

21:29.255 --> 21:33.509
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

21:34.552 --> 21:38.014
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

21:38.222 --> 21:40.350
It's so good to see you.
-And you.

21:40.558 --> 21:44.479
Nice meeting you.
-Likewise.

21:44.687 --> 21:48.566
Okay. Bye, now.
-Drive safely.

21:50.151 --> 21:53.196
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

21:53.404 --> 21:55.239
I'll be right back.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.745
Gretchen.

22:01.746 --> 22:02.747
Hey.

22:07.710 --> 22:10.296
Hey.
-Hey yourself.

22:10.505 --> 22:12.340
What did you...?

22:14.884 --> 22:16.719
We need to talk.

22:16.928 --> 22:20.973
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

22:22.225 --> 22:25.228
Please. Please.

22:39.450 --> 22:44.080
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

22:44.288 --> 22:48.418
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

22:48.626 --> 22:51.963
I just wanna say, man-
-What? What do you wanna say?

22:52.171 --> 22:53.673
I just wanna go on record, man.

22:53.881 --> 22:57.260
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

22:57.468 --> 22:59.762
Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
-Shut up!

22:59.971 --> 23:01.764
Jesus.

23:01.973 --> 23:05.309
Serious, I might have a concussion.
-Don't fall asleep, baby.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.437
Subdural hematoma.
-Don't fall asleep.

23:07.645 --> 23:10.189
Shut up.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.525
All right. Empty your pockets.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.111
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

23:15.319 --> 23:16.529
Do it!

23:21.492 --> 23:23.036
All right, turn around.

23:23.244 --> 23:24.495
Turn around.

23:24.996 --> 23:27.290
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

23:32.337 --> 23:36.049
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

23:49.604 --> 23:51.522
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any-

23:51.731 --> 23:53.399
We shot it all.
-Yeah?

23:54.025 --> 23:56.903
Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
-Yeah.

23:57.111 --> 23:59.238
All right, tell you what.

23:59.447 --> 24:03.242
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now...

24:03.451 --> 24:07.413
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

24:07.622 --> 24:09.540
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.754
There you go.

24:17.632 --> 24:19.967
All right, come on.
On the table.

24:20.885 --> 24:24.180
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

24:24.389 --> 24:25.431
Division of labour.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.812
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

24:31.020 --> 24:33.106
Where's the rest of my meth?

24:33.314 --> 24:35.733
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.819
You shut up.
-You shut up, skank.

24:38.027 --> 24:40.863
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

24:41.364 --> 24:44.742
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.454
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

24:48.663 --> 24:51.833
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

24:52.041 --> 24:54.836
...for being such a pussy.

24:57.338 --> 25:00.800
Hey. Hey, baby.

25:01.009 --> 25:04.887
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

25:10.184 --> 25:11.853
All right.

25:12.061 --> 25:15.481
You two are never
getting high again.

25:15.690 --> 25:18.276
I will make it my life's mission.

25:18.484 --> 25:21.154
Not another needle,
not another ball...

25:21.362 --> 25:25.408
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mine.

25:27.785 --> 25:29.662
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

25:29.871 --> 25:33.041
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

25:33.249 --> 25:34.751
You're damn right, plus interest.

25:34.959 --> 25:37.462
Where?
-Back yard.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.298
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

25:40.506 --> 25:43.676
Hurting. Painful.
-Hey, hey, hey.

25:43.885 --> 25:47.597
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

25:47.805 --> 25:50.808
Hey, don't move.

25:54.103 --> 25:55.855
Come on.

25:58.274 --> 25:59.525
See?

25:59.734 --> 26:02.987
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

26:03.196 --> 26:06.032
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.034
What am I supposed to do with this?

26:08.242 --> 26:11.204
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

26:11.412 --> 26:13.706
Get high.

26:18.002 --> 26:19.587
Yo, that's my bank.

26:19.796 --> 26:22.006
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

26:22.215 --> 26:24.717
It's a victimless crime.

26:25.426 --> 26:26.469
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

26:27.887 --> 26:28.971
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>

26:29.180 --> 26:31.683
<i>In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>

26:32.266 --> 26:35.186
<i>What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumbass?</i>

26:35.395 --> 26:37.563
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>

26:37.772 --> 26:40.108
<i>All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>

26:40.316 --> 26:42.568
<i>-Nobody even noticed.
-Nobody noticed?</i>

26:42.777 --> 26:47.448
<i>-For real?
-I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>

26:55.705 --> 26:57.665
Oh, my God.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.752
Jesus. Come on already.

27:01.961 --> 27:05.423
It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
-You don't know what you're doing.

27:05.631 --> 27:08.050
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.428
Yeah. Boosted.

27:10.636 --> 27:12.596
It's not like he ever got one open.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.598
At least I got persistence.

27:14.807 --> 27:17.685
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

27:17.893 --> 27:22.440
Don't listen to that skank.
-Stop calling me that.

27:23.190 --> 27:24.734
I ain't no skank!

27:24.942 --> 27:27.278
Skank, skank, skank-
-Hey, hey, hey.

27:27.486 --> 27:28.988
Sit, sit.

27:29.196 --> 27:33.284
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

27:34.118 --> 27:36.078
Now, chill.

27:36.662 --> 27:39.582
You, get that thing open.

27:39.790 --> 27:43.961
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

27:48.424 --> 27:50.426
Where's the kid?

27:52.011 --> 27:53.471
The kid. The little kid!

27:53.679 --> 27:56.640
What are you asking me for?

28:12.907 --> 28:16.494
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

28:16.702 --> 28:17.953
Didn't see that coming, huh?

28:22.667 --> 28:23.959
What kind of mother are you?

28:25.378 --> 28:28.881
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

28:29.090 --> 28:31.634
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

28:31.842 --> 28:34.512
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.180
Are you serious?

28:36.389 --> 28:39.517
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

28:39.725 --> 28:41.102
Oh, my God.
-Yeah, Diesel...

28:41.310 --> 28:44.188
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.775
Get out of the way.

28:48.275 --> 28:50.611
Get out of the way!

29:06.460 --> 29:07.837
So you didn't tell anyone.

29:08.045 --> 29:11.424
You didn't tell Elliott.
-Not yet.

29:12.216 --> 29:15.886
Well, what does that mean?
-That means exactly what it means.

29:16.095 --> 29:19.390
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

29:22.059 --> 29:25.396
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

29:25.604 --> 29:26.731
All right.

29:26.939 --> 29:32.236
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

29:32.445 --> 29:34.405
This was...

29:34.613 --> 29:38.451
This entire thing was unfortunate.

29:38.659 --> 29:40.911
Unfortunate?

29:42.288 --> 29:45.458
And I apologise deeply.

29:46.042 --> 29:47.585
Thank you.

29:49.128 --> 29:52.423
Now please tell me why you did it.

29:54.175 --> 29:58.012
That's not really at issue here.

29:58.346 --> 30:02.266
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

30:04.435 --> 30:07.605
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

30:07.813 --> 30:09.273
...how are you paying for it?

30:09.482 --> 30:14.236
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

30:14.862 --> 30:17.615
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

30:17.823 --> 30:20.534
You tell your wife and son...

30:20.743 --> 30:22.953
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

30:23.162 --> 30:25.790
Why are you doing this?

30:27.583 --> 30:30.461
I will clear this up with them.

30:30.670 --> 30:33.881
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

30:34.090 --> 30:35.716
...thanking me for saving your life.

30:35.925 --> 30:40.012
Why would you do that to her?
-As I said, I will clear this up.

30:40.221 --> 30:44.934
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

30:45.142 --> 30:46.143
All right?

30:46.352 --> 30:48.979
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

30:49.188 --> 30:51.649
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

30:54.568 --> 30:56.904
I don't owe you an explanation.

30:57.113 --> 31:00.741
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologised.

31:00.950 --> 31:03.744
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

31:03.953 --> 31:06.914
There. I've apologised twice now.

31:07.123 --> 31:10.001
I'm humbly sorry.

31:10.209 --> 31:11.669
Three times.

31:11.877 --> 31:13.838
Let me just get this straight.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.424
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

31:16.632 --> 31:18.092
...no strings attached.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.511
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.389
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

31:23.597 --> 31:28.019
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

31:28.227 --> 31:30.062
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

31:30.271 --> 31:32.273
...you involve us in your lie.

31:32.481 --> 31:38.362
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

31:40.364 --> 31:44.327
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

31:46.829 --> 31:49.206
What happened to you?

31:52.084 --> 31:54.211
Really, Walt.

31:54.420 --> 31:56.213
What happened?

31:56.422 --> 31:59.216
Because this isn't you.

32:02.261 --> 32:06.140
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

32:06.349 --> 32:10.770
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

32:10.978 --> 32:13.314
That I should go begging
for your charity?

32:14.023 --> 32:17.360
And you waving
your chequebook around...

32:17.568 --> 32:21.113
...like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget...

32:21.322 --> 32:22.448
...how you and Elliott-

32:22.657 --> 32:25.743
How you and Elliott cut me out?

32:25.951 --> 32:27.745
What? That can't be how you see it.

32:27.953 --> 32:31.415
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

32:31.624 --> 32:33.542
That cannot be how you see it.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.670
Good. That's beautifully done.
-You left-

32:35.878 --> 32:37.672
You are always
the picture of innocence.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.424
You left me.
-The picture of innocence.

32:40.633 --> 32:44.178
Just sweetness and light.
-You left me.

32:44.970 --> 32:46.263
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

32:46.472 --> 32:49.600
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

32:49.809 --> 32:52.395
...and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

32:52.603 --> 32:55.272
What? Did I dream all of that?

32:55.481 --> 32:57.983
That's your excuse...

32:58.192 --> 33:00.986
...to build your little empire
on my work?

33:01.195 --> 33:03.447
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

33:03.656 --> 33:06.701
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

33:06.909 --> 33:09.620
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

33:14.041 --> 33:17.628
I don't even know what to say to you.

33:18.337 --> 33:21.382
I don't even know where to begin.

33:26.679 --> 33:32.018
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

33:34.603 --> 33:37.148
Fuck you.

34:12.766 --> 34:14.685
Hey.

34:17.730 --> 34:21.275
Hey, little man, you hungry?

34:35.081 --> 34:36.623
Hey.

34:59.438 --> 35:02.316
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

35:04.151 --> 35:05.194
No, what are you doing?

35:07.613 --> 35:09.615
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

35:09.824 --> 35:11.492
Baby, get up and help me.

35:11.701 --> 35:15.246
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

35:15.454 --> 35:17.373
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

35:21.252 --> 35:22.336
Bedtime.

35:26.090 --> 35:28.634
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

35:33.431 --> 35:36.267
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

35:36.475 --> 35:38.352
Is that you? You're the big man?

35:38.561 --> 35:41.230
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

35:41.439 --> 35:44.066
Try and hit me now, bitch.

36:15.806 --> 36:17.099
Oh, hey.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.727
Should I ask where you've been?

36:20.853 --> 36:22.563
Never mind.

36:22.772 --> 36:25.775
We're long past that, I suppose.

36:26.859 --> 36:28.694
Skyler.

36:34.825 --> 36:38.245
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

36:48.673 --> 36:50.341
Walt.

36:51.217 --> 36:53.511
We need to talk.

37:05.272 --> 37:07.149
Just say it.

37:16.951 --> 37:19.829
They're cutting off the money.

37:31.590 --> 37:34.552
What did she say, exactly?

37:36.846 --> 37:41.892
Not much. It was abrupt.

37:42.101 --> 37:45.938
She said something like:

37:47.440 --> 37:51.360
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

37:51.569 --> 37:56.157
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

37:56.365 --> 37:59.452
I wish you the very best."

38:01.203 --> 38:03.497
And that was it.

38:09.170 --> 38:10.755
Yeah.

38:11.422 --> 38:15.676
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

38:15.885 --> 38:17.803
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

38:18.012 --> 38:20.514
I was so stunned, but...

38:20.723 --> 38:25.644
I called her back
and she didn't pick up.

38:31.609 --> 38:36.864
So, what do you know about this?

38:39.533 --> 38:44.622
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

38:44.830 --> 38:48.459
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

38:48.668 --> 38:51.962
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

38:56.008 --> 38:57.760
Walt.

38:58.427 --> 39:00.471
What do you know that I don't?

39:05.434 --> 39:07.812
Where were you tonight?

39:09.772 --> 39:11.273
I drove up to Santa Fe.

39:13.943 --> 39:15.194
I was with Gretchen.

39:15.403 --> 39:18.656
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

39:19.740 --> 39:24.412
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

39:24.620 --> 39:27.498
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

39:27.707 --> 39:30.835
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

39:31.043 --> 39:32.920
...and beating around the bush-

39:33.129 --> 39:37.008
Okay, what-? Tell us what?

39:38.759 --> 39:40.511
Well...

39:42.471 --> 39:43.514
There was a lot of...

39:44.807 --> 39:47.184
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

39:47.393 --> 39:52.940
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

39:53.149 --> 39:55.109
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

39:55.317 --> 39:59.655
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

40:03.576 --> 40:05.119
They're broke.

40:05.911 --> 40:08.706
You are kidding me.
-No.

40:09.415 --> 40:12.293
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

40:12.501 --> 40:17.131
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and...

40:17.340 --> 40:20.009
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

40:20.217 --> 40:24.055
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

40:25.431 --> 40:27.099
That is-

40:28.851 --> 40:30.978
Jesus, that's...

40:34.440 --> 40:35.733
Yeah.

40:45.951 --> 40:52.083
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

40:54.669 --> 40:57.254
Well, they're prideful people.

40:59.882 --> 41:01.509
Listen.

41:03.177 --> 41:05.221
Not to sound selfish...

41:06.055 --> 41:08.432
...but as far as we go...

41:08.641 --> 41:12.103
...we'll get through this, okay?

41:12.645 --> 41:19.068
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

41:19.735 --> 41:20.778
Hey.

41:24.907 --> 41:29.578
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.747
Okay.

41:42.425 --> 41:44.343
And yet...

41:45.678 --> 41:48.681
...she still drives a Bentley.

41:53.769 --> 41:57.982
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

42:10.369 --> 42:13.331
Baby, that don't make any sense.

42:13.539 --> 42:17.251
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

42:17.460 --> 42:20.254
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

42:20.463 --> 42:21.922
Nowhere.

42:22.131 --> 42:25.051
I'd make it, like, strong.

42:25.259 --> 42:27.345
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

42:27.553 --> 42:29.680
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

42:29.889 --> 42:34.602
Oh, baby,
that H is bringing me down.

42:34.810 --> 42:37.104
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

42:37.313 --> 42:40.316
I need to... I need to even out.

42:40.524 --> 42:43.736
Let me get a hit of that crystal.
-Hell, no. You lost your share.

42:43.944 --> 42:45.237
Come on, baby.

42:45.446 --> 42:48.449
It's all I need, just a little hit.

42:48.658 --> 42:52.578
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

42:52.787 --> 42:54.622
I ain't no skank.

42:55.456 --> 42:59.210
I would appreciate an apology.

43:02.922 --> 43:03.964
What?

43:04.173 --> 43:06.884
I am trying to take
the high road here.

43:07.093 --> 43:08.427
Are you gonna do right?

43:08.636 --> 43:09.720
Listen to me, stupid.

43:09.929 --> 43:13.432
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

43:13.641 --> 43:17.395
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

43:17.603 --> 43:21.107
...and assist me and shut up.

43:24.527 --> 43:26.737
I ain't no skank.

43:26.946 --> 43:28.906
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

43:29.490 --> 43:32.576
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

43:33.244 --> 43:34.578
You listening to me, skank?

43:35.162 --> 43:36.455
You hear me, skank?

43:36.664 --> 43:40.751
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

43:40.960 --> 43:44.839
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

43:45.047 --> 43:48.217
I ain't no skank.

43:48.592 --> 43:51.012
No, no, no. Don't. No.

44:07.278 --> 44:10.114
I ain't no skank.

45:10.132 --> 45:11.175
<i>911.</i>

45:24.313 --> 45:26.941
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

45:27.149 --> 45:30.361
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

45:30.569 --> 45:33.280
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

45:33.489 --> 45:35.700
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

45:35.908 --> 45:39.370
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

45:51.799 --> 45:53.718
Here you go.

45:53.926 --> 45:58.556
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

45:58.764 --> 46:02.393
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

46:03.602 --> 46:07.398
Look, just...
Just don't go back inside. All right?

46:07.606 --> 46:10.526
You stay right here. Okay?

46:17.408 --> 46:21.037
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.
