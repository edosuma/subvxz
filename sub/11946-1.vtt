00:38.706 --> 00:41.457
[Male narrator] Since
before recorded time

00:41.458 --> 00:46.462
it had swung through the universe
in an elliptical orbit so large

00:46.463 --> 00:52.427
that its very existence remained
a secret of time and space.

00:52.428 --> 00:56.723
But now, in the last few years
of the 20th century,

00:56.724 --> 00:59.892
the visitor was returning.

01:07.901 --> 01:11.946
The citizens of Earth would get
an extra Christmas present this year,

01:11.947 --> 01:15.074
as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.286
Scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions,

01:18.287 --> 01:22.874
something not seen on Earth
for 65 million years.

01:22.875 --> 01:27.045
Indeed, not since the time
that the dinosaurs disappeared,

01:27.046 --> 01:28.838
virtually overnight.

01:32.176 --> 01:37.346
There were a few who saw this
as more than just a coincidence.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.267
But most didn't.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.385
I'm showing you
the top of the line here.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.889
This is the best we have.
This is $9.50.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.016
- $9.50?
- But wait a minute.

02:22.017 --> 02:25.228
This is $8.00, okay?
This is $7.50.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.604
This lady over here,
she's wearing the $7.50.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.481
- Yeah, I like it.
- Let me tell you about this thing.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.005
Blow on it there.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.133
See?
See how nice that is?

02:55.134 --> 02:56.717
Isn't that great?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.845
I know you got $9.50.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.316
- Will it work?
- Oh, yeah.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.901
I know it will.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.153
This spring, look at it.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.696
Isn't that nice.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.489
And the other side.
Look at it.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.949
Isn't that great?
$9.50.

03:21.410 --> 03:22.660
[Salesman]
Enjoy the movie.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.371
Excuse me,
where's the men's room?

03:25.372 --> 03:27.331
- One minute.
- Do you work here or not?

03:27.332 --> 03:28.457
Hey, Regina.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.750
Regina, give that thing
a rest, will ya?

03:29.751 --> 03:30.877
In a minute, Mel.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.130
Look, I don't pay you to do
that kind of stuff around here.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.465
Regina, I want you
to clean everything up

03:36.466 --> 03:39.010
so we can get out of here
in time to watch the comet.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.261
Everything's cleaned up.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.471
Damn!

03:42.472 --> 03:45.933
I want you to take this flashlight
and walk the house.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.977
Aw, Mel,
they throw things at me.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.562
Who cares?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.189
Walk the house.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.232
Have you ever been hit
with Dots, Mel?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.610
Milk Duds?
Those things hurt.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.778
I... I don...

03:57.779 --> 03:59.030
Oh, how are you, sir?

03:59.031 --> 04:01.032
The refreshments
are right over there.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.700
Thank you.
Thank you.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.870
I don't want those weirdos cutting up
the seats, you understand?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.414
Okay, okay, okay.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.084
Replacing Reg in third place

04:12.085 --> 04:16.672
is Reg, third place.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.050
[Beeping]

04:20.677 --> 04:21.844
Wait a minute.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.597
Somebody named DMK
in sixth place.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.765
When did this happen?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.183
[Mel]
Look, don't be an overachiever,

04:27.184 --> 04:29.352
you'll fit in better
with your age group, okay?

04:30.187 --> 04:32.230
This is really annoying.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.357
Regina, Regina,
look this way.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.234
Regina!
Look at me!

04:36.235 --> 04:37.735
Read my lips.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.780
Flashlight.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.659
Walk house now, hm?

04:44.660 --> 04:45.952
Okay, Mel.

04:47.663 --> 04:48.871
Let me take this for you.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.415
Uh, uh, that, that's great,
they go to profits.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.542
And listen, stay out
of the projection booth.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.710
And stay away from Dupree!

04:54.711 --> 04:56.796
I'm gonna fire that guy
some day.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.673
He's been doing to me what
he's been doing to her in the booth.

04:58.674 --> 05:02.677
[Screaming in movie]
[Female] David, that was a scream.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.762
[Male] You're right,
I'm gonna check it out.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.097
You stay here.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.307
[Male #2] I'm talkin'
about a mint condition print

05:08.308 --> 05:09.600
of It Came from Outer Space.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.645
In 3D, man.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.481
Yeah, right, Tres Dimensiones.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.900
Look, you know as well as I do,
you got film freaks

05:17.901 --> 05:19.986
who'd go down on you
for a bootleg print of that.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.948
Oh, a hundred bucks?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.032
Hundred bucks, right.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.701
[Knocks phone] Something wrong
with the phone here

05:26.702 --> 05:28.286
or did I hear you say
a hundred dollars?

05:28.287 --> 05:30.371
Look, a hundred dollars
isn't going to get it this time.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.207
Because I'm gonna have
to spend the night in here

05:33.208 --> 05:35.126
waiting for you
to bring the print back.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.962
Think I'm gonna miss this comet thing
for a lousy hundred dollars?

05:37.963 --> 05:40.047
[Yelling in movie soundtrack]

05:40.048 --> 05:42.008
Okay, $110's
a little better, yeah.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.552
Hey, Reggie, here's the deal.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.220
You leave,
I let you in the back door.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.764
Okay, I leave, you let me back in.
Mel thinks everybody's gone.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.850
Larry, do you know anybody
named DMK?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.059
No, ow!

05:52.060 --> 05:54.645
No, you gotta have the print back
by 6:00 in the morning.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.773
You know, if we spend the night
in here, we're gonna miss the comet.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.651
It's not like you can't see it
on television, you know.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.486
All right, hey,
get your guy here in an hour.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.489
Yeah, well, maybe I want
to see it for real, okay?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.908
Hey, television's real.
Television's very real.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.454
So, what do you say?
I'll give you $15.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.457
Are you kidding?

06:14.458 --> 06:16.125
We spend the night in here
and we end up making it.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.418
And you give me 15 bucks?

06:17.419 --> 06:18.836
Do you know what
that makes me look like?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.630
Reggie, I'm not giving you 15 bucks
for making it with me.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.676
Okay, well, just so we have
that straight, okay?

06:25.677 --> 06:27.386
Yeah, for sure.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.972
I mean, you'd be worth
a lot more than 15 bucks.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.474
Everybody knows that.

06:33.352 --> 06:37.772
The first earthlings to see the effects
will be in Newfundland.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.982
Or Newfoundland.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.736
This is expected
to begin at... at 2:04.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.780
- That's Pacific Standard Time.
- [Male] Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

06:45.781 --> 06:50.534
Uh, interesting, uh, sidebar
to this story is the fact that

06:50.535 --> 06:53.329
all telecommunications
seem to be out

06:53.330 --> 06:54.872
in that part of the world.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.707
Uh, this could have...
[phone ringing]

07:03.673 --> 07:05.049
Hello.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.968
Samantha, you sound pissed.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.889
I just had it out with Doris
once and for all again.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.684
She wants me to like,
haul chips and dips around

07:15.685 --> 07:18.062
for her little comet party.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.815
Yeah, well, speaking of Doris,
look, I need your help.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.818
Tell her that, uh, you know
all about this field trip

07:23.819 --> 07:25.986
that I'm gonna take, okay,
with my science class?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.197
We're gonna go to the observatory
to watch the comet.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.824
She won't go for it.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.909
She'll go for it.
Just tell her, okay?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.285
Okay.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.206
[Sighs]

07:38.750 --> 07:40.584
Doris.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.253
Reggie's on the phone.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.256
She's not having car trouble?

07:45.257 --> 07:46.715
She's gonna be out all night

07:46.716 --> 07:48.926
with her science class
at the observatory.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.637
I know all about it.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.264
[No audible dialog]

07:53.265 --> 07:54.640
[Male in movie]
We gotta get outta here.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.891
Yeah, hi, Doris.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.977
What's this about a science
class, Regina?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.854
Well, you want me to do better
in science, don't you?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.858
I want you home in five minutes
after you finish work.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.193
If you want to watch the comet,
you can do it here.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.321
Look, Doris, like, I'm 18, okay?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.740
And I can watch the comet
wherever I want to watch the comet.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.952
Here, Samantha.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.787
You and your sister share
a lot of secrets.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.289
I want you to share
this one with her.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.376
If it were up to me,
I couldn't care less what she did.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.795
But if your father
makes it back home

08:24.796 --> 08:27.631
without some Sandinista
blowing his brains out,

08:27.632 --> 08:29.216
he's gonna hold me responsible

08:29.217 --> 08:31.260
for any kind of trouble
you two girls get into.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.929
What we have here is
a chain of command.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.390
The Major jumps on me,
I jump on you.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.351
Did you get that?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.020
Okay.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.357
Now, are you going
to join the party?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.526
Join the party for what, Doris?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.445
So I can watch Chuck
from across the street

08:49.446 --> 08:51.906
stick his hands
down your pants?

08:51.907 --> 08:53.699
I think that's something
Daddy should know.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.410
Chuck's a nice guy.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.747
He's certainly nice to be with
while Daddy's down in Banana Land.

08:59.748 --> 09:03.042
You were born with an asshole, Doris,
you don't need Chuck.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.971
Looks like a... a... a real nice crowd
we have out here tonight.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.734
Sarah, Chucky.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.069
Hey, where have you been?
You're gonna miss everything.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.862
- It's gonna start.
- Oh, kids.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.198
I'll never marry
another man with kids.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.368
In 1910,
Halley's Comet returned.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.453
Everybody thought
they were going to die then.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.417
[Explosion]

09:45.835 --> 09:47.211
What was that?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.337
Look!

09:56.555 --> 09:58.806
You want to know
what bugs me about all this?

09:58.807 --> 09:59.974
What?

10:01.351 --> 10:05.229
Well, I'm always afraid someone's
gonna see us, you know?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.313
See us how?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.774
There's no windows.
They can't see through walls.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.819
Well, Superman
can see through walls.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.905
Not these walls,
they're made out of steel.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.365
Used to be a fire law.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.242
Uh!

10:18.243 --> 10:21.203
Superman can see through steel.

10:21.204 --> 10:24.415
Nope, it's the one thing
he cannot see through.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.417
That's lead, you nerd.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.211
- Lead?
- Yeah.

10:29.212 --> 10:32.047
I mean, Superman can see through steel
like it wasn't there even.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.173
Huh.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.384
Larry!

10:35.385 --> 10:36.969
[Male DJ] well, I guess I'm the only
one who's not outside

10:36.970 --> 10:38.095
watching the meteor shower.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.263
I just might put
the radio station

10:39.264 --> 10:41.181
on autopilot
and sneak out myself.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.851
[Explosions]

[Ticking]

13:17.589 --> 13:19.631
[Male on radio]
This is the big K in Los Angeles.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.633
A great looking morning
in Southern California.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.220
Fifty thousand watts of coiled steel
and passion FM in the AM.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.722
It's wake up time
in the city of angels.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.932
And I'm Steve LaBeau.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.392
[Knock]
[Male] God damn it!

13:30.977 --> 13:32.644
What? What?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.148
I've been waiting by that door
for the last 30 minutes

13:36.149 --> 13:37.900
and that pinhead hasn't brought
the film back yet!

13:37.901 --> 13:39.526
Oh, give the guy a break.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.737
I mean, people are late
sometimes.

13:42.697 --> 13:45.157
No, something's wrong.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.826
If he screwed that film up,
we could all be in a lot of trouble.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.329
[Radio playing pop]

13:50.330 --> 13:52.122
I'm gonna go over there
on the bike.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.541
Aw, jeez, don't I get
an Egg McMuffin or anything?

13:55.376 --> 13:56.418
You could do me a favor.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.378
I did you a favor last night.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.713
That guy calls,

14:01.382 --> 14:02.883
you tell him
I'm on my way over

14:02.884 --> 14:04.635
and I'm very, very, very,
very pissed!

[Chuckles] Get it?
5-5-5-hits.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.135
Do you know where the Armed
Forces Reserve Center is

33:33.136 --> 33:34.762
at Los Alamitos?

33:34.763 --> 33:36.430
Yeah.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.891
My dad used to take us there
for target practice.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.978
They store automatic
weapons there.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.313
You know how to use 'em?

33:45.190 --> 33:47.108
Come on, Hector.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.526
The MAC-10
submachine gun

33:48.527 --> 33:50.987
was practically designed
for housewives.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.408
I got a call.

33:55.409 --> 33:57.326
It came in on the hit line.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.953
Hello?

34:00.330 --> 34:02.289
- Hello.
- It went dead.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.000
- Did they say they were okay?
- I don't know.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.668
[Samantha] They said
they were in the desert.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.211
[Regina] The desert.
What desert was it?

34:07.212 --> 34:09.295
- I don't know.
- [Hector] shit! Think!

34:09.297 --> 34:10.755
Why don't you just
pull your gun on her?

34:10.757 --> 34:12.007
Maybe you can scare it
out of her.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.219
They said they were like,
part of a think tank,

34:15.219 --> 34:16.637
a research group
or something.

34:16.638 --> 34:17.972
[Hector]
Where, was it in this State?

34:19.474 --> 34:20.641
I forget.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.476
[Hector]
Okay, let's take it real slow.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.395
Did they mention a town?

34:24.396 --> 34:28.482
Uh, someplace they were near,
like maybe Blythe, Bishop?

34:28.483 --> 34:30.484
[Regina] Uh, what about
Edwards Air Force Base?

34:30.485 --> 34:33.612
If I knew, I'd tell you.
I didn't expect the call, you know.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.239
I didn't take notes
or something.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.241
[Regina]
Just try and remember.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.243
You think I'm not telling you
something on purpose?

34:39.244 --> 34:41.661
Well, if they'll stay put,
we can get them.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.289
From a psychological standpoint,

34:43.290 --> 34:45.498
the radio station represents
a link to normalcy.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.543
I don't think they'll wander far
as long as it's operating.

34:48.378 --> 34:52.840
Dr. Carter, I'd just like to say
up front, I'm opposed to this.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.801
There's no reason for us
to bring those people

34:55.802 --> 34:58.054
or any other survivors
back here.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.348
What about
the disintegration factor?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.267
You just want
to let that happen?

35:03.268 --> 35:06.062
We don't know that the condition
is progressive.

35:06.063 --> 35:08.064
I think we've
established that, Audrey.

35:08.065 --> 35:11.192
Partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.611
But progression is steady
in any case.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.489
- Drying of the body fluids...
- Oh, get to the point, Oscar!

35:16.490 --> 35:19.617
We've heard this a thousand times.
What about the dust?

35:19.618 --> 35:22.870
Ultimately, there is nothing left
but calcium dust.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.539
Right, so there isn't even
enough hope

35:25.540 --> 35:27.917
to warrant bringing
anybody back here.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.170
So, what you're saying is,
we shouldn't even try.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.381
Right.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.636
We don't want to be caught
in the city after dark.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.720
We'll leave tomorrow.

35:42.099 --> 35:44.350
We've had an indication
of some survivors

35:44.351 --> 35:47.228
in San Bernardino, as well...
four, maybe five.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.772
[Hector]
Wait, girls, just shut up!

35:49.773 --> 35:54.777
Samantha, did they say
anything else? Anything?

35:57.155 --> 36:01.117
Yeah. They said
be careful on the street.

36:01.701 --> 36:04.745
Because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.499
What happened to Doris
is happening to them.

36:09.459 --> 36:10.793
Only slower.

36:12.462 --> 36:16.465
And like... they're dangerous.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.802
[Regina]
Like what happened to Larry.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.662
[Motor racing]

36:55.297 --> 36:58.174
You're not gonna blame me
because the phone went dead.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.176
I'm not the phone company.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.887
Nobody's the phone company
anymore.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.568
[Pop music playing]

37:17.569 --> 37:18.777
What?

37:20.197 --> 37:21.488
Cops?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.867
Where were you guys earlier?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.792
[Police radio chattering]

37:33.793 --> 37:36.295
Oh, shit.
My license.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.423
Oh, shit!

37:47.390 --> 37:49.642
I know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something,

37:49.643 --> 37:52.770
but I am really glad to see...
[screams]

38:05.742 --> 38:07.076
[Gasps]

38:09.829 --> 38:11.247
[Recorded broadcast continues]
It's the weekend comet sale.

38:11.248 --> 38:12.248
Everything must go.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.667
Big savings on tuners,
turntables, car stereos.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.210
Also demos
and crate damaged items.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.504
This weekend only.
Henry's Stereo warehouse.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.256
Fourth and Alameda.
Free coffee for the adults.

38:20.257 --> 38:21.548
Free balloons for the kids.

38:24.386 --> 38:26.303
[Jingle]
Number one.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.848
[Pop music playing]

38:58.295 --> 38:59.962
[Water running]

39:45.425 --> 39:46.800
[Screams]

39:47.010 --> 39:49.470
This is from your stepmom,
you punk.

39:50.638 --> 39:51.930
[Screams]

39:51.931 --> 39:54.850
They're here, they're here!

39:54.851 --> 39:57.311
- What's wrong?
- It's okay, I got it.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.897
- You've got her?
- Yeah, I got her!

40:06.988 --> 40:08.822
Sammy, Sam, it's only a dream.

40:10.658 --> 40:15.913
I know.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.167
Is there anything I can do?

40:22.045 --> 40:23.253
I'm fine.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.006
[Broadcast] Interstate Technologies
is an equal opportunity employer.

40:26.007 --> 40:29.176
[Click] Looks like the weather
is shaping up for a great weekend.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.302
You know, it's hard to believe
that there's

40:30.303 --> 40:32.971
only 11 more shopping days
till Christmas.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.556
Good luck finding
a parking space

40:34.557 --> 40:36.058
within hitchhiking distance
of a mall.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.684
You know how jammed
it can get.

40:46.903 --> 40:47.903
She okay?

40:48.905 --> 40:51.365
Yeah.
I guess so.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.619
Come on in, have a seat.

41:01.626 --> 41:02.918
Listen.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.796
I have to go
to San Diego tomorrow.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.006
Why?

41:09.175 --> 41:10.509
My mom.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.430
Some friends, my sister.

41:14.431 --> 41:16.640
But you know they're gone.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.100
I know, but...

41:19.352 --> 41:20.644
I still have to find out.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.729
I mean, you guys know for sure,
but I don't know.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.901
Did you have like,
a close family?

41:30.697 --> 41:31.864
Yeah.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.616
Pretty close.

41:36.453 --> 41:38.120
You?

41:38.121 --> 41:40.330
No, not really.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.333
My real mom hung around
till my dad came back from Viet Nam

41:43.334 --> 41:44.793
and then she split.

41:44.794 --> 41:47.212
So, it's been mostly
me and Sam.

41:47.213 --> 41:51.216
And Dad
and Third Special Forces.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.634
Smoke Bomb Hill.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.053
Fort Bragg.

41:55.805 --> 41:57.097
[Explosion sound]

42:00.935 --> 42:04.104
But, then around
about sixth or seventh grade,

42:04.105 --> 42:06.148
it became real obvious
that we weren't boys

42:06.149 --> 42:08.233
and we were never gonna go
to ranger school.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.818
[Chuckles]

42:10.320 --> 42:14.656
So, I guess Dad figured
there was nothing more to offer us.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.116
So, he found us a new mom.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.827
Went off looking for a war.

42:20.455 --> 42:21.580
[Scoffs]

42:24.083 --> 42:25.834
What about the um...

42:28.421 --> 42:29.755
the guy?

42:30.798 --> 42:32.007
Larry?

42:32.008 --> 42:35.636
Oh, he and I weren't going steady
or anything like that.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.232
[Sighs]

42:51.778 --> 42:54.363
Look, don't go
to San Diego, okay?

42:54.364 --> 42:55.739
I have to.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.659
But I'll be back.

43:02.038 --> 43:03.539
Please, okay?

43:04.332 --> 43:05.707
[Exhales]

43:09.629 --> 43:11.588
What'll you give me
if I come back?

43:19.222 --> 43:20.389
Texas.

43:20.390 --> 43:21.682
[Chuckling]

43:21.683 --> 43:24.309
[Regina laughing]
I'll give you Florida.

43:24.310 --> 43:26.103
Florida and Texas.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.480
[Hector]
Florida, Texas, and Hawaii.

43:28.481 --> 43:31.024
[Regina laughing]
Hawaii?

43:31.025 --> 43:33.068
I wanted Hawaii.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.112
[Hector]
When I come back...

43:37.323 --> 43:38.699
I'll take you to dinner.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.287
Your choice.
[Regina laughing]

43:55.675 --> 43:57.718
[Hubcap rattling]

43:57.719 --> 43:58.802
Here.

44:09.522 --> 44:11.356
[Cocking]

44:14.902 --> 44:16.111
Great.

44:16.112 --> 44:17.154
[Cocks]

44:24.495 --> 44:26.872
See, this is the problem
with these things.

44:26.873 --> 44:28.582
Daddy would have
gotten us Uzis.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.586
The car didn't know
the difference.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.716
[Bells chiming]

44:42.430 --> 44:44.097
So, did you make it
with him last night?

44:45.099 --> 44:46.266
Who?

44:46.267 --> 44:48.268
The good humor man,
who do you think?

44:50.229 --> 44:51.688
Jeez, is that
what's buggin' you?

44:51.689 --> 44:53.231
That's no answer, man?

44:54.192 --> 44:57.277
No, I didn't make it with him
last night.

44:57.278 --> 44:58.695
Why are you so weirded out?

44:58.696 --> 45:00.697
Oh, right, Reg,
why should I be weirded out?

45:00.698 --> 45:03.283
My sister, who swiped every guy
I ever had my eye on,

45:03.284 --> 45:06.453
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freaked-out world.

[Growling]

47:26.052 --> 47:28.804
I don't know who you are
out there, but I have a gun.

47:29.722 --> 47:32.599
So, if I were you,
I'd split while I had a chance.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.559
[Growling continues]

47:34.560 --> 47:35.894
Okay?

[Snarling]

47:46.989 --> 47:49.199
Look kid, just stay away,
we don't want any!

47:53.621 --> 47:54.746
Shit!

47:55.122 --> 47:56.164
[Growling]

47:56.624 --> 47:58.291
Get outta here,
you little creep.

48:07.468 --> 48:09.261
Lucky for you I like kids.

48:17.854 --> 48:20.272
Jesus!
There goes the neighborhood.

48:37.123 --> 48:38.415
Shit.

48:44.213 --> 48:46.339
Audrey, what's the code?

48:49.594 --> 48:50.635
Mm.

48:57.727 --> 48:58.852
[Chuckles]

49:07.737 --> 49:09.362
We found survivors.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.032
How long will
the blood tests take?

49:15.870 --> 49:17.037
Not long.

49:17.038 --> 49:21.124
I've talked with some of the others
and we decided that it would be

49:21.125 --> 49:24.085
more beneficial to conduct
the blood tests in the field.

49:25.004 --> 49:27.339
So, I want you to go to I.A.
With the rest of the group.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.675
Whatever the majority wants.

49:35.806 --> 49:39.392
You don't seem to hold majority rule
in very high regard.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.770
[Female]
If something's wrong, it's wrong.

49:41.771 --> 49:43.939
Majority rule doesn't have
anything to do with it.

49:44.941 --> 49:47.525
But it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group,

49:47.526 --> 49:49.277
which is to survive.

49:49.278 --> 49:51.279
You'll grant me that?

49:51.280 --> 49:55.158
The core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility.

50:26.732 --> 50:28.984
[No audible dialog]

50:59.932 --> 51:02.350
It's about the twelfth can
you've downed this morning.

51:02.643 --> 51:03.685
Thirsty.

51:03.686 --> 51:06.396
Yeah, well, what are you going to do
when your complexion freaks out?

51:06.397 --> 51:08.732
Dermatologist is dead,
you know.

51:08.733 --> 51:11.234
I know, and I'm getting a rash
or something too.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.570
Oh, God, you and your rashes.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.989
Hey, I'm sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.789
[Sighs]
So, do you like him?

51:26.834 --> 51:28.668

Come on, Sam.

51:28.669 --> 51:30.837
I'm just interested.

51:33.215 --> 51:35.717
Yeah, well, I guess so.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.927
I mean, he's nice.

51:40.347 --> 51:43.016
There was this new guy
at school, Paul Morgan.

51:43.309 --> 51:46.394
He transferred from Taft.
Junior.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.354
Oh, I don't hang around
with juniors much.

51:51.901 --> 51:53.526
I liked him.

51:53.527 --> 51:54.611
Mm.

51:54.612 --> 51:58.698
I mean, he was from Taft, but...

52:00.910 --> 52:02.410
he was nice.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.877
Kathy said he was probably
going to ask me out.

52:13.756 --> 52:15.256
Kathy.

enough to debate the issue.

Hey, it's 450 FM in the PM.

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:56.215
I'm Steve LaBeau, and you're listening
to 50,000 watts of rock and roll

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:58.841

Did you happen to see
two girls runnin' around here?

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:53.522
One's a cheerleader.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.568
I'm not thinking straight.

01:09:57.569 --> 01:10:00.696
I wrote everything down, but...

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.114
I think I misspelled it.

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.580
No, thanks, I have one.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.293
Seems to be the perfect

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.130

they were talking hypothetically.

Until they found
the first survivors.

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:32.144
Then they really did it.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.149
Some of those survivors
were just kids.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.860
Hey, wait a minute.
What's all this about blood?

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:45.324
They think they can
generate a serum.

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:47.743
A serum?

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:51.705
We were exposed.
Not a lot. Just enough.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.459
They left the ventilating
ducts wide open.

That's not important.

How much blood were we expected
to get from these people?

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:06.757
- Uh, 300 ccs, yes, that's it.
- That can't be right.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:10.093
If we draw 300 ccs a day,
they'll expire altogether.

No, I don't think so, now that
we've terminated brain functions.

is manufacture blood.

like 300 ccs out of those children.

to the respirators now.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.380
- Keep an eye on her.
- Right.

01:23:30.381 --> 01:23:32.715
Now, Wilson!

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:35.259
Forget the door!
Turn off the alarm!

01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:40.306
Uh!

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:47.480
[Solid tone]

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.652
[Child]
I don't know.

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:56.155
My parents told me never
to breathe anything from strangers.

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:57.240
Hey!

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.368
Get your hands up.

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:08.418
What are you guys doing?

01:24:08.419 --> 01:24:10.003
They said if we breathe this,

01:24:10.004 --> 01:24:13.798
we could go to the North Pole
and see Santa Claus.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:15.591
That's so sick.

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:16.634
Hey!

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:18.136
[Screams]
Holy shit!

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:19.512
- Whoa.
- Sam?

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:20.763
I give, I give.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:22.890
They said you were dead.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.977
They were exaggerating totally.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:28.438
- Hey, that's a great outfit.
- Thanks.

01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:29.939
[Samantha] Is that guy
in the hallway dead?

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:32.775
Don't.

01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:37.780
[Solid tone]

01:24:43.954 --> 01:24:45.121
Well?

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.378
You can give up
if you want to, Wilson.

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:58.259
But we still have
the two children and that girl.

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:01.512
[Boy]
I forgot my football.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:02.638
[Samantha]
We'll get you another football.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:04.140
[Regina]
We'll get you a stadium.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:08.144
Now.

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.814
[Laughing]

01:25:20.491 --> 01:25:22.658
Get everybody topside.
Now!

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:23.618
What about them?

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.037
Screw them.

01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:27.914
[Laughing continues]

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:35.254
[Samantha]
Okay, kids, going up.

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:37.298
Put your hands down, kids.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.675
God, don't be so stupid.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.482
- Come on, kids!
- Who are the kids?

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:55.942
- I'm Brian.
- I'm Sarah.

01:25:55.943 --> 01:25:58.152
Yeah, and I'm Aunt Reg
and that's Aunt Sam

01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:59.654
and that's Uncle Hector.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:00.822
Can I have my bunny?

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:03.491
In a minute.
Beat feet, Uncle Hector.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:04.784
Uncle Hector?

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:06.744
Hey, it's my bunny, you know?

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:08.830
[Country music playing]

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:16.129
Where have you been?

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:17.380
[Samantha]
Can we change this?

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.048
Arranging a hotfoot
for your friends.

01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:20.716
I really hate this music.

01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:22.093
Give me a break!

01:26:24.805 --> 01:26:25.847
What are you doing?

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:29.600
I'm not kidding,
I get car sick without my bunny.

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.936
Come on, Reg,
give the kid the bunny.

01:26:31.937 --> 01:26:33.855
We've stopped,
why have we stopped?

01:26:33.856 --> 01:26:36.899
- Son of a...
- Don't shoot them, you idiot.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.694
Okay, kids, cover your eyes
for Uncle Hector.

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:44.532
Hey!

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:45.867
Think tank, huh?

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:48.619
Uh, look, couldn't
we just like, leave?

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.745
Think over this!

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:52.999
We can get them.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.043
- Hey, we'll be taking off now.
- We have to get them.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:59.046
Look us up at Chasen's.
Uh, we'll party down, huh?

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.840
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, this is fun.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.927
The kids would like to say good-bye,
it's been fun.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:06.804
Hope to see you around
real soon.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.058
Is that gasoline I smell?

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:17.440
Wait, wait, don't, don't!

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:43.424
Wow.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.634
All right, Hector.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.601
[Screaming]

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.734
Let go of her!
Leave her alone!

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:06.155
Hector!

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:10.159
[Gunshots]

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:13.746
- [Child] Reggie.
- [Samantha] It's all right.

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:16.666
- [Crying]
- It's all right. It's okay.

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.210
I got you.

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.711
It's all right.

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:22.380
It's okay.

01:28:22.381 --> 01:28:23.714
I got you.

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.341
Shhh.

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:34.141
[Thunderclaps]
[Rain]

01:29:07.301 --> 01:29:09.427
[Female]
Okay, kids, smile, come on.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:11.679
[Sighs]

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.682
Oh, don't... God, you're so cute!
You're just so cute... wait.

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:17.810
Mr. Bunny needs to be
in this picture too.

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:19.437
So, okay, that's great.

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:20.730
Can I take this jacket off?

01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:22.231
- It itches.
- No, you can't.

01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:24.108
I just want to take
another picture, all right?

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:25.359
- Please?
- No.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.652
Now, you just hold on to that.

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:28.154
- Stay there. Okay, perfect.
- Oh, brother.

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:30.239
[Boy] There's still
a few zombies around.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.034
Don't slouch.
And Sarah...

01:29:33.035 --> 01:29:34.160
Hold that.

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:37.288
Smile.

01:29:37.289 --> 01:29:39.457
[Camera cycles]
[Sighing]

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:40.666
[Regina]
Did the flash go off?

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:42.626
Can't tell on these things.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.920
Hey, if you're gonna throw
those guns away,

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:46.213
can I have one?

01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:51.135
Don't look at me.

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:52.803
I mean, I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:58.809
Smile, Hec.

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:02.730
Handsome.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:06.776
Maybe I could be
a nun or something.

01:30:07.527 --> 01:30:09.737
Ooh, I just love these pictures.

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:11.989
[Brian] You've only taken
about 30 of 'em.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.282
You know, we're going to need
some more film soon.

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:14.367
- Let me straighten your tie.
- Okay.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:17.912
God, they look
like the Brady Bunch.

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:21.207
What are you waiting for?

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.209
Can I see 'em?

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:25.044
We're waiting
for the light to change.

01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:26.629
We do not cross
against the light.

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:32.760
Are you nuts,
Auntie Regina?

01:30:33.512 --> 01:30:37.306
[Sighs] You may as well
face the facts, Samantha.

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:41.227
The whole burden of civilization
has fallen upon us.

01:30:43.647 --> 01:30:45.272
What's that supposed to mean?

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:50.277
It means we do not cross
against the light.

01:30:52.406 --> 01:30:54.573
That's totally stupid!

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:56.075
There's nobody here!

01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:59.328
See, we're talking ghost town!

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:07.753
[Tires squealing]

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:08.838
See what happens.

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:18.556
God, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross
against the light like that.

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.727
Hey, you guys are
survivors too, huh?

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:29.442
- What?
- Nothin'.

01:31:29.443 --> 01:31:30.401
Great car.

01:31:30.944 --> 01:31:33.362
Thanks, I have 23 of them.
You want to go for a ride?

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:35.406
More than you know.

01:31:39.077 --> 01:31:40.619
We don't know anything
about this guy.

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:42.872
Where's he from?

01:31:42.873 --> 01:31:44.165
What's his name?

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:46.375
- What's your name.
- Danny Mason Keener.

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:48.961
Danny Mason Keener, okay?

01:31:50.881 --> 01:31:54.341
Yeah, all right, well, just be back
by midnight, okay?

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:55.885
Midnight?

01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:58.971
The burden of civilization
is on us, okay?

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.681
Oh, yeah.

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:02.224
Bitchin', isn't it?
