00:52.052 --> 00:52.845

00:55.296 --> 00:57.195
Time to hand in your own work.

00:57.195 --> 00:59.783
[bright music]

01:02.510 --> 01:05.720
If you're wondering why
we're not emailing this

01:05.720 --> 01:07.274
or pressing a button to make

01:07.274 --> 01:08.930
some sort of
computer submission,

01:08.930 --> 01:11.485
it's because I want this
physically handed in.

01:11.485 --> 01:15.454
200 people on this
job. 40,000 man hours.

01:15.454 --> 01:17.318
Two strong suspects.

01:17.318 --> 01:20.252
There's a weight
of evidence here,

01:20.252 --> 01:22.496
and I want 'em to
feel that weight.

01:22.496 --> 01:25.292
I want 'em to hold all your
hard work in their hands

01:25.292 --> 01:27.466
before they make their decision.

01:27.466 --> 01:30.090
It's the biggest job
of my career, this,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.678
and I know it's the same for
many of you, so well done.

01:35.025 --> 01:36.579
Now, we just need a volunteer

01:36.579 --> 01:38.167
to take it round to CPS, please.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.585
[bright music continues]

01:44.863 --> 01:46.485
- Marina?

01:46.485 --> 01:47.452
It's in.

01:47.452 --> 01:48.901
Now all we can do is wait.

can't stay away. Look.

04:10.146 --> 04:13.149
[telephone ringing]

04:16.946 --> 04:18.637
- What?

04:18.637 --> 04:22.572
- CPS have agreed to
press charges, and
request extradition.

04:22.572 --> 04:24.747
- But you knew that already.

04:24.747 --> 04:26.058
- No.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.268
- Then, then why are you here?

04:28.268 --> 04:31.305
- Because Marina
wants a meeting,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.618
and she wants it at
her lawyer's place.

04:36.137 --> 04:38.312
- Why would Marina
need a lawyer?

04:38.312 --> 04:39.589
- What my client would like

04:39.589 --> 04:42.454
while the CPS
considers its options

04:42.454 --> 04:46.044
is a public inquest into
her husband's death.

04:46.044 --> 04:49.634
She believes that an inquest
will maintain public awareness.

04:49.634 --> 04:51.739
She believes it will
expedite matters.

04:51.739 --> 04:53.362
She believes that
it will give us all,

04:53.362 --> 04:55.329
and we include you in this,

04:55.329 --> 05:00.230
a far better chance
of establishing
Russian culpability.

05:00.230 --> 05:01.231
- Sorry.

05:01.231 --> 05:03.820
She believes this or you do?

05:05.028 --> 05:08.584
- Louise Christian is
a human rights lawyer.

05:08.584 --> 05:09.930
Very experienced.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.483
She explained what we-
- To be clear,

05:11.483 --> 05:15.384
my client does not need your
permission for any of this.

05:15.384 --> 05:17.144
She's just making you aware.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.906
- Marina, we were going
to call you about this,

05:20.906 --> 05:22.494
but given you wanted a meeting,

05:22.494 --> 05:25.014
we agreed that it will be
better coming in person.

05:26.464 --> 05:30.088
The CPS has decided to
press murder charges,

05:30.088 --> 05:31.641
and to request extradition.

05:31.641 --> 05:33.333
It's fantastic notes.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.853
- Yes, but it won't
change anything.

05:36.853 --> 05:38.959
Extradition won't follow.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.547
- Extradition will be requested

05:40.547 --> 05:42.100
by the British Embassy directly.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.274
- Fine, but they're
not gonna get anywhere.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.863
- [scoffs] We don't know that.

05:46.863 --> 05:47.692
- [Peter] No.

05:49.763 --> 05:53.214
- How did your detectives get
on when they were in Moscow?

05:54.975 --> 05:57.115
- I'm in the process
of finding a barrister

05:57.115 --> 05:58.875
to represent my client.

05:58.875 --> 05:59.842
- [Clive] You don't
need to do that.

05:59.842 --> 06:01.878
- If by a miracle-

06:01.878 --> 06:03.397
- It confuses things.
- extradition is granted-

06:03.397 --> 06:04.881
- It gets in the way.
- then we can all reconvene.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.435
- [Louise] That way we
will waste no more time.

06:06.435 --> 06:07.677
- What do you mean, more time?

06:07.677 --> 06:09.196
- Is that fair?

06:09.196 --> 06:10.749
I address that to you, you
being the most senior, yes?

06:10.749 --> 06:13.303
- Look, you either trust in
the British justice system,

06:13.303 --> 06:14.512
or you don't.

06:14.512 --> 06:16.410
- Honestly, I could
trust in it more.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.206
- I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about your client,

06:19.206 --> 06:21.760
or Marina, as we
tend to call her.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.762
She asked us to do
a job. We did it.

06:23.762 --> 06:26.006
We put colleagues'
lives in danger,

06:26.006 --> 06:27.766
and now we need to
let it play out.

06:27.766 --> 06:28.595
- Stop!

06:31.598 --> 06:33.047
It's like cats and dogs.

06:35.809 --> 06:37.500
- Here's an idea.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.227
Whatever the decision
over extradition,

06:40.227 --> 06:43.195
it shouldn't take more
than a few days to arrive.

06:43.195 --> 06:46.682
The second it does,
we let Marina know.

06:46.682 --> 06:48.200
From that moment on,

06:48.200 --> 06:51.825
everyone around this table
agrees to support Marina

06:51.825 --> 06:55.553
with an inquest or whatever
you choose to do next.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.418
How does that sound

07:03.043 --> 07:08.048
- Thank you.

07:10.153 --> 07:11.223
- [Clive] Peter?

07:11.223 --> 07:13.156
- [Peter] You near a television?

07:13.156 --> 07:14.364
- Um...

07:14.364 --> 07:15.193
Yes.

07:16.505 --> 07:18.265
- [Peter] It's called Russia TV.

07:18.265 --> 07:19.784
- Russia TV?

07:19.784 --> 07:21.302
- Right the way up.

07:21.302 --> 07:23.097
If you get to the dirty
ones, you've gone too far.

07:24.167 --> 07:26.756
- Yeah.
[ominous music]

07:29.932 --> 07:32.037
'An insignificant
target who the FSB

07:32.037 --> 07:34.454
would not have
bothered murdering.'"

07:34.454 --> 07:36.732
- When are the embassy
asking for extradition?

07:36.732 --> 07:38.285
- [Peter] This afternoon.

07:38.285 --> 07:40.183
- Pff. Talk about bad timing.

07:40.183 --> 07:42.634
- No, this, this
isn't timing, Clive.

07:43.773 --> 07:45.810
This is him giving
his answer in advance.

07:47.190 --> 07:50.470
All you're watching
is televised fuck you.

07:50.470 --> 07:54.474
[ominous music continues]

07:54.474 --> 07:57.511
- The Russians are not
going to allow extradition.

07:59.893 --> 08:01.998
We heard about an hour ago.

08:01.998 --> 08:05.277
I wanted to be the one to
tell you, face to face.

08:07.694 --> 08:09.454
- This is why we
ask for a meeting.

08:10.593 --> 08:11.974
We knew this would happen.

08:12.906 --> 08:14.563
And

08:14.563 --> 08:16.496
police work is finished.

08:17.807 --> 08:20.016
- A murder case is never closed.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.469
- You're working on this now?

08:26.333 --> 08:27.196
- Personally?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.720
- Clive working on this now?

08:37.206 --> 08:38.863
Brent,

08:38.863 --> 08:39.898
I

08:39.898 --> 08:41.451
trust you

08:41.451 --> 08:42.487
very much.

08:43.902 --> 08:48.528
From beginning, all of you,
you try to catch this man,

08:51.979 --> 08:53.740
but now it is

08:53.740 --> 08:55.017
done.

08:55.017 --> 08:56.812
If want to continue fighting-

08:56.812 --> 09:00.298
- Marina, I'm always
here if you need someone-

09:00.298 --> 09:02.265
- If?
- to talk to.

09:02.265 --> 09:04.164
- If I want to
continue fighting,

09:07.443 --> 09:09.410
I fight on my own, yes?

09:12.275 --> 09:14.933
[Brent exhales]

[people yelling]

09:44.653 --> 09:48.173
[ominous music continues]

09:55.664 --> 09:57.907
- Uh, Louise, I
don't understand.

09:57.907 --> 09:59.046
You are my lawyer.

09:59.046 --> 10:00.841
- I'm your solicitor.

10:00.841 --> 10:02.981
But if there's an inquest,
we'll need a barrister, too.

10:02.981 --> 10:04.983
There are a lot of
good ones in London.

10:04.983 --> 10:06.813
He is one of the very best.

10:09.470 --> 10:10.713
[intercom ringing]

10:10.713 --> 10:11.956
- [Receptionist] Matrix.

10:11.956 --> 10:13.440
- [Louise] Hello. Here
to see Ben Emmerson.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.683
- [Receptionist]
One moment, please.

10:14.683 --> 10:17.271
- So, the question for
you is never gonna be,

10:17.271 --> 10:20.378
is he good enough,
but, do I trust him,

10:20.378 --> 10:22.967
and does this feel right?

10:22.967 --> 10:24.900
[door lock buzzes]

10:24.900 --> 10:27.592
[siren wailing]

10:36.152 --> 10:37.671
- Well, they'd have been
placed with the teapot.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.605
That's excellent, but here's
the one that seals it for me,

10:40.605 --> 10:44.022
the U-bend from Lugovoy's
sink, because I'm sorry,

10:44.022 --> 10:45.472
polonium might do many things,

10:45.472 --> 10:47.232
but it doesn't
cross-contaminate its way

10:47.232 --> 10:48.509
into the U-bend of your sink.

10:48.509 --> 10:50.028
You have to pour it there.

10:50.028 --> 10:53.549
Now, this shows that these
are the men responsible.

10:53.549 --> 10:54.792
- Yes?

10:54.792 --> 10:56.138
- Well, when you factor
in all the rest of it,

10:56.138 --> 10:57.277
unquestionably.

10:58.865 --> 11:03.628
But, you know, it
is very important to
say, Mrs. Litvinenko,

11:03.628 --> 11:06.320
that if you and I are to
work together on this,

11:06.320 --> 11:07.874
now, push for this inquest,

11:07.874 --> 11:10.877
then our objective
cannot be to show

11:10.877 --> 11:13.086
these are the men that
killed your husband.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.331
- But I need to show this.

11:18.816 --> 11:20.162
- That's not our brief.

11:21.611 --> 11:22.958
- It is brief.

11:22.958 --> 11:24.718
- It's not the one
I've been given.

11:26.271 --> 11:27.100
May I show you?

11:29.550 --> 11:31.104
Not that you won't
have seen it already.

11:31.104 --> 11:35.695
- This may be the time
to say one or two things

11:35.695 --> 11:37.282
to the person responsible.

11:38.456 --> 11:41.252
You may succeed in silencing me,

11:42.460 --> 11:45.359
but the howl of protest
from around the world

11:45.359 --> 11:48.397
will reverberate, Mr. Putin,

11:48.397 --> 11:51.987
in your ears for the
rest of your life.

11:55.093 --> 11:57.130
- It's not what your
husband's asking us.

11:59.028 --> 12:03.343
He wants us to lay this at
the door of Vladimir Putin.

12:04.344 --> 12:05.414
That is the brief.

12:05.414 --> 12:07.036
[bright music]

12:07.036 --> 12:09.107
So if we do this,

12:09.107 --> 12:12.732
and even though it might take
a considerable amount of time,

12:14.941 --> 12:17.046
then that is what I
suggest we try and do.

12:19.635 --> 12:22.017
[door shuts]

12:25.020 --> 12:28.471
[bright music continues]

12:31.958 --> 12:33.545
Before any inquest can begin,

12:33.545 --> 12:36.238
the rules of the game
need to be established,

12:36.238 --> 12:39.759
what is or or is not
admissible, and so on,

12:39.759 --> 12:42.865
but none of what happens
here is gonna be a trial.

12:42.865 --> 12:44.142
It's not us versus them.

12:44.142 --> 12:47.007
It's a lot of stuffy
old lawyers like me

12:47.007 --> 12:49.665
putting a lot of
things before a judge,

12:49.665 --> 12:52.047
and it's for the
judge alone to decide.

12:53.462 --> 12:54.981
- To judge the judge.

12:54.981 --> 12:58.398
- Precisely. But first we need
to jump through some hoops.

12:58.398 --> 12:59.917
- Our preliminary assessment

12:59.917 --> 13:02.471
does establish a
prima facie case

13:02.471 --> 13:05.060
as to the culpability
of the Russian state

13:05.060 --> 13:07.096
in the death of
Alexander Litvinenko.

13:09.098 --> 13:10.099
- Mr. Emmerson.

13:12.515 --> 13:14.379
- Sir, may I thank
the inquest team

13:14.379 --> 13:16.692
for their preliminary report.

13:16.692 --> 13:20.213
That there is a case for
Russian state responsibility

13:20.213 --> 13:23.457
in the death of Mr. Litvinenko
is of course something

13:23.457 --> 13:26.875
that my client has
been hoping to explore

13:26.875 --> 13:30.879
since her husband made
clear to her whilst dying

13:30.879 --> 13:33.674
that that was his own belief.

13:35.090 --> 13:37.886
- In which case, I will
look to confirm the date

13:37.886 --> 13:40.371
on which we can begin
the substantive hearings.

13:41.648 --> 13:43.098
[cheerful Christmas music]

13:43.098 --> 13:45.548
- Ben is very happy,
very positive.

13:45.548 --> 13:47.102
Everything take time, of course,

13:47.102 --> 13:49.311
but Ben says there
is good chance

13:49.311 --> 13:52.901
to prove Russian responsibility
at highest level.

13:54.109 --> 13:57.008
He keeps fighting.
You keep fighting.

13:57.008 --> 13:59.252
Ben and I, well,
we keep fighting.

14:01.564 --> 14:02.600
What?

14:02.600 --> 14:03.843
- Oh,

14:03.843 --> 14:05.361
nothing.

14:05.361 --> 14:08.364
You said the name Ben three
times in the last minute.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.608
- [chuckles] What
is wrong with that?

14:11.712 --> 14:13.162
- [Alex] Nothing, nothing.

14:13.162 --> 14:13.991
- Stop.

14:15.924 --> 14:18.788
This is very dangerous
situation for me.

14:18.788 --> 14:19.617
Do you not see?

14:21.861 --> 14:22.689
- Yes.

14:24.277 --> 14:26.382
- I put all my hope

14:27.556 --> 14:30.870
in this one man,
in this one place.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.287
[bright music]

14:34.287 --> 14:37.877
[Alex speaking in Russian]

14:40.741 --> 14:44.159
[bright music continues]

14:46.402 --> 14:47.231
- Right.

14:48.473 --> 14:49.302
Sorry.

14:51.131 --> 14:51.960
Ready?

14:59.899 --> 15:02.384
[door clacks]

15:06.629 --> 15:10.288
[Oscar speaking in Russian]

15:14.706 --> 15:17.537
[keys clattering]

15:19.263 --> 15:20.471
Boss?

15:20.471 --> 15:23.232
[ominous music]

15:23.232 --> 15:24.061
Boss?

15:30.619 --> 15:34.312
[ominous music continues]

15:34.312 --> 15:35.141
Boss?

15:43.045 --> 15:43.908
Boris!

15:48.568 --> 15:49.396
Boss?

15:52.675 --> 15:53.504
Boss?

15:54.919 --> 15:58.405
[ominous music continues]

16:02.306 --> 16:03.893
[Oscar grunts]
[door shatters]

16:03.893 --> 16:06.482
[Oscar gasping]

16:06.482 --> 16:09.485
[people chattering]

16:15.975 --> 16:18.391
- The, uh, the judge is going
to invite the government

16:18.391 --> 16:20.393
to hold a public inquiry.

16:20.393 --> 16:22.740
Now, that would mean
that the materials

16:22.740 --> 16:25.501
they wanted hidden
will remain hidden,

16:25.501 --> 16:28.263
but that he, crucial,
will get to see them,

16:28.263 --> 16:30.886
and not just see them, take
them into consideration.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.820
- This is good?

16:33.820 --> 16:35.339
- Oh, it's a hell of a lot
better than it was at lunchtime.

16:35.339 --> 16:36.719
Put it that way. All right.

16:39.136 --> 16:41.621
You're Temple, I'm
Chancery Lane, so.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.004
- How long will this take?

16:47.523 --> 16:49.974
- Too long, probably, but then,

16:51.113 --> 16:53.012
yeah, we knew that
it would, didn't we?

16:55.497 --> 16:56.946
My knowing's half the battle.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.780
[carillon tolling]

17:05.541 --> 17:08.096
[rain pouring]

17:10.546 --> 17:14.274
- "Evening Standard."

17:14.274 --> 17:19.279
[ominous music]
"Standard."

17:23.076 --> 17:26.597
[ominous music continues]

17:32.499 --> 17:36.745
[ominous music continues]

17:36.745 --> 17:41.060
- Taxi!

17:41.060 --> 17:44.580
[ominous music continues]

17:50.759 --> 17:54.003
- He makes a series of
anti-Putin remarks, like Sasha,

17:54.003 --> 17:56.316
and the next thing
you know, like Sasha,

17:56.316 --> 17:58.836
he's found dead in
unexplained circumstances.

17:58.836 --> 18:01.873
- But not like Sasha in that
he had a scarf around his neck.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.220
Bruising all on there.

18:03.220 --> 18:05.187
- Yeah, I'm not saying
that it's not suicide.

18:05.187 --> 18:06.430
- And the door was
locked from the inside.

18:06.430 --> 18:09.157
- I'm saying it's
worth investigating.

18:09.157 --> 18:11.849
- You know what, Brent?
It's a simple job.

18:13.230 --> 18:15.818
You get a brief,
you get to work,

18:15.818 --> 18:18.580
you make your submission
at CPS, or not, depending,

18:18.580 --> 18:20.064
and you move on to the next one.

18:20.064 --> 18:21.824
Staying emotionally attached-

18:21.824 --> 18:22.929
- Oh, you mean caring?

18:22.929 --> 18:25.897
- is not a strength.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.106
Not in a way you think it is.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.590
[cellphone ringing]
- Sorry.

18:32.732 --> 18:34.285
Oh, I, I've...

18:34.285 --> 18:36.701
I'm sorry.
[cellphone ringing continues]

18:36.701 --> 18:39.118
[door opens]

18:40.740 --> 18:41.568
Hi.

18:43.467 --> 18:44.778
Okay.

18:44.778 --> 18:45.607
Tell me.

18:46.677 --> 18:49.266
[somber music]

18:50.819 --> 18:52.545
I'm coming right now.

18:54.685 --> 18:58.102
[somber music continues]

19:00.277 --> 19:02.727
- Just I [sighs]

19:02.727 --> 19:05.247
feel like we keep running
into the same brick wall.

19:07.007 --> 19:10.459
- Yeah, but at least we get
to run into it together.

19:14.325 --> 19:17.777
[somber music continues]

19:18.640 --> 19:20.124
- Thank you.

19:20.124 --> 19:22.885
- The UK has refused a request
to set up a public inquiry

19:22.885 --> 19:25.474
to replace the
inquest into the death

19:25.474 --> 19:28.305
of the former Russian
spy Alexander Litvinenko.

19:28.305 --> 19:29.927
Mr. Litvinenko was poisoned

19:29.927 --> 19:33.586
with radioactive polonium
in London in 2006.

19:33.586 --> 19:36.589
A disappointing decision
then for the family today.

19:36.589 --> 19:39.281
- Six reasons from
the home secretary

19:39.281 --> 19:42.974
for why a public inquiry
is being refused,

19:42.974 --> 19:44.355
including, risibly,

19:44.355 --> 19:48.014
the admission that international
relations are a factor,

19:48.014 --> 19:51.914
which, to translate into English
from the original bullshit,

19:51.914 --> 19:54.020
means that trade opportunities

19:54.020 --> 19:57.851
are more important to this
country than the life of,

19:57.851 --> 19:59.784
of, of one of its citizens.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.445
- Maybe government knows
it was not actually Putin.

20:06.619 --> 20:08.414
- But it was actually Putin.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.451
[Marina sobbing]

20:11.451 --> 20:13.764
What Russian citizen would
dare do something like this

20:13.764 --> 20:14.937
without his blessing?

20:14.937 --> 20:17.146
But you know, Putin's
not the problem.

20:18.355 --> 20:20.426
Well, he's not the only problem.

20:20.426 --> 20:23.256
What today proves
more than anything

20:23.256 --> 20:26.846
is that we are taking on
an entire regime here,

20:27.881 --> 20:31.264
one that is immoral, cowardly,

20:31.264 --> 20:35.026
one that, yeah, it
answers to Putin's drum,

20:35.026 --> 20:37.270
one that deludes
itself into believing

20:37.270 --> 20:39.030
that it has an
international relevance

20:39.030 --> 20:40.618
that it lost long ago.

20:40.618 --> 20:42.896
But as of today, the
regime we are up against

20:42.896 --> 20:44.553
isn't the Russian regime.

20:44.553 --> 20:47.211
[ominous music]

20:51.319 --> 20:56.289
- It's the United Kingdom.

20:58.464 --> 21:02.399
[garbage truck beeping]

21:02.399 --> 21:06.713
[wind howling]
[leaves rustling]

21:06.713 --> 21:09.440
[Marina humming]

21:11.891 --> 21:14.065
[birds twittering]

21:14.065 --> 21:17.241
- He would. He definitely
would, if you can see it.

21:17.241 --> 21:19.243
It's real, to be honest.

21:19.243 --> 21:22.142
Oh, mate, your mum's here.

21:22.142 --> 21:23.385
- See ya, mate.

21:29.046 --> 21:30.219
- You smoke?

21:30.219 --> 21:31.048
- What?

21:31.911 --> 21:34.293
- Do not smoke, Anatoly.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.778
Your sports like your father.

21:36.778 --> 21:39.125
- Well, sport's not
exactly my thing.

21:39.125 --> 21:42.231
- How about helping your
mother with shopping?

21:42.231 --> 21:43.336
Is this your thing?

21:47.858 --> 21:49.377
Alex is coming later.

21:49.377 --> 21:54.140
I was gonna take this to the
cemetery, but maybe tomorrow.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.003
- I can do it now.

21:57.039 --> 22:02.044
- Hmm. Okay.
[bright music]

22:06.290 --> 22:09.707
[bright music continues]

22:14.712 --> 22:18.129
[bright music continues]

22:20.891 --> 22:22.824
- Anatoly's school
fees are settled.

22:23.859 --> 22:25.447
The apartment is secured,

22:25.447 --> 22:30.349
but there can be no more
money taken from the estate.

22:30.349 --> 22:35.250
We certainly cannot afford
barristers like Ben Emmerson.

22:38.218 --> 22:39.047
- So,

22:42.222 --> 22:43.431
that's it?

22:43.431 --> 22:47.366
I just tell him it's
over, everything stop?

22:48.436 --> 22:49.298
- Sorry.

22:50.645 --> 22:52.198
- Okay, so, uh,

22:53.475 --> 22:54.338
no more money.

22:56.616 --> 22:57.755
We think of new way.

22:59.481 --> 23:02.173
[clock ticking]

23:04.003 --> 23:04.831
- Marina,

23:07.593 --> 23:08.904
it's been seven years.

23:10.458 --> 23:12.356
Seven years.
[door shuts]

23:12.356 --> 23:14.945
I think it's time for you to
ask yourself the question,

23:14.945 --> 23:17.050
"What more can I do?"

23:19.812 --> 23:21.365
[somber music]

23:21.365 --> 23:24.506
- The grave was covered in
moss and leaves and stuff,

23:24.506 --> 23:26.059
but I took care of it.

23:27.475 --> 23:29.166
You should never let
it get like that.

23:30.823 --> 23:31.962
- Thank you.

23:31.962 --> 23:35.379
[somber music continues]

23:41.420 --> 23:44.837
[somber music continues]

23:46.873 --> 23:48.530
- There are three things
we could be doing.

23:48.530 --> 23:51.050
One, keep this in
the public eye,

23:51.050 --> 23:53.017
two, keep the police on side,

23:53.017 --> 23:55.330
and three, wait.

23:55.330 --> 23:56.158
Crucial.

23:57.505 --> 24:01.232
Every time Putin does something,
influences an election,

24:01.232 --> 24:04.235
annexes Georgia,
the pressure mounts,

24:04.235 --> 24:07.307
and there'll come a point when
even the British government

24:07.307 --> 24:08.930
can't be seen to
look the other way.

24:08.930 --> 24:12.105
And when that day comes,
that's when we strike.

24:17.007 --> 24:18.595
You haven't touched
your sandwich.

24:22.875 --> 24:24.601
- This morning, I, um,

24:25.567 --> 24:27.327
visit Louise Christian.

24:30.158 --> 24:31.262
I explain her,

24:32.747 --> 24:33.886
I'm very scared.

24:36.578 --> 24:37.476
From now on,

24:38.787 --> 24:39.788
no more money.

24:42.377 --> 24:44.690
Expensive barrister,

24:46.795 --> 24:47.624
not possible.

24:53.319 --> 24:54.838
- So now you've come to see me?

24:57.426 --> 24:59.428
You bought a sandwich
you don't even want,

24:59.428 --> 25:01.154
and you wanna know what I think?

25:06.435 --> 25:07.264
I think,

25:10.681 --> 25:13.339
I think we're just gonna
have to carry on anyway,

25:13.339 --> 25:14.478
is what I think.

25:14.478 --> 25:16.273
You and I, we've
started something, and,

25:17.723 --> 25:19.863
well, I'm afraid that I'm
just gonna have to insist

25:19.863 --> 25:22.037
we see it right towards the end.

25:22.037 --> 25:25.696
I also think you need to put
that sandwich back in your bag.

25:25.696 --> 25:27.629
Take it home for Anatoly.

25:27.629 --> 25:29.562
- Yes.
- Before I eat it for him.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.187
- Thank you, Ben.

[bright music continues]

26:14.849 --> 26:17.161
[keyboard clacking]

26:17.161 --> 26:19.198
Dear Mr. Putin,

26:19.198 --> 26:22.581
my name is Marina Litvinenko.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.548
I believe you to be responsible

26:24.548 --> 26:26.515
for the murder of my husband.

26:27.931 --> 26:30.243
I have shared this belief
with the British media,

26:31.417 --> 26:34.213
and I have asked
my prime minister

26:34.213 --> 26:36.525
to authorize a public inquiry

26:36.525 --> 26:39.425
so that you may be
held to account.

26:39.425 --> 26:42.704
In the words of my husband,
may God forgive you.

26:44.326 --> 26:46.156
[dog barks]

[somber music continues]

27:10.974 --> 27:14.633
[people chattering]

27:14.633 --> 27:16.462
- [clears throat]
Sorry, everybody.

27:24.263 --> 27:27.646
[somber music continues]

27:31.063 --> 27:32.202
Forgive me.

27:32.202 --> 27:33.030
Thanks.

27:40.313 --> 27:42.350
What are we doing
this afternoon?

27:42.350 --> 27:44.145
No, don't, don't answer that.

27:44.145 --> 27:46.078
I'll tell you exactly
what we're doing.

27:47.493 --> 27:50.979
- I cannot understand why
the British government

27:50.979 --> 27:53.430
needs to cover for
the people in Kremlin

27:53.430 --> 27:55.915
responsible for the
murder of my husband.

27:55.915 --> 27:59.574
After all, the government
is supposed to be interested

27:59.574 --> 28:02.750
in finding out who is
responsible for the murder

28:02.750 --> 28:05.373
of a British citizen in
the streets of London.

28:06.546 --> 28:09.826
Now the decision is
up to Theresa May.

28:09.826 --> 28:11.310
- [Jenny] Brent.

28:11.310 --> 28:14.485
- I call on her to
begin an investigation.

28:15.797 --> 28:19.352
I want to ask her as
one woman to another,

28:21.147 --> 28:23.425
how would she feel in my place

28:24.806 --> 28:28.189
if her husband were
murdered in such a way?

28:29.397 --> 28:31.226
Would she not want
to know the truth?

28:33.539 --> 28:34.367
- [Newsreader] Our
correspondent, Julia Kremer,

28:35.299 --> 28:36.887
is in Westminster.

28:36.887 --> 28:39.787
[birds twittering]

28:41.754 --> 28:45.206
[somber music continues]

28:46.379 --> 28:48.450
[footsteps approaching]
[floorboards creaking]

28:48.450 --> 28:49.658
- Mum.

28:49.658 --> 28:50.487
Mum!

28:53.524 --> 28:55.526
[Marina speaking in Russian]

28:55.526 --> 28:58.184
[Anatoly sighs]

29:01.567 --> 29:03.155
- It's in the Ukraine.

29:03.155 --> 29:05.053
They think it was
shot down by Russia.

29:06.468 --> 29:09.126
Isn't that the kind of thing
we've been waiting for?

29:09.126 --> 29:11.128
The thing they can't ignore?

29:11.128 --> 29:14.131
[telephone ringing]

29:16.168 --> 29:17.583
Hello?

29:17.583 --> 29:20.172
[bright music]

29:24.659 --> 29:26.937
- So what, she's
just coming over?

29:26.937 --> 29:28.905
It's that like a,
like a Russian thing,

29:28.905 --> 29:30.216
like with Australians?

29:30.216 --> 29:32.391
You know, just invite
yourself round?

29:32.391 --> 29:34.013
- You don't need to tidy up.

29:35.187 --> 29:38.638
She's not that sort
of person. She's nice.

29:38.638 --> 29:41.296
[taxi rumbling]

29:46.785 --> 29:49.511
[engine revving]

29:49.511 --> 29:50.305
- This morning,

29:51.237 --> 29:52.791
Theresa May,

29:52.791 --> 29:54.516
she decided.

29:54.516 --> 29:55.621
yes,

29:55.621 --> 29:56.760
we have inquiry.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.764
I wanted to tell you, Brent,

30:01.661 --> 30:03.008
before anyone else.

30:04.423 --> 30:08.599
Straight away, I know
Brent needs to know this,

30:08.599 --> 30:12.500
because Brent was the first
person at the hospital.

30:13.708 --> 30:14.640
- Yes.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.572
- Late at night.

30:16.573 --> 30:17.505
- Yes.

30:17.505 --> 30:18.506
- How many years ago now?

30:19.645 --> 30:21.440
- Eight years this year.

30:21.440 --> 30:26.376
- The first person to believe
my husband, to listen to us.

30:27.239 --> 30:29.793
This is very big moment.

30:31.105 --> 30:33.176
- And you'll need everyone
on the police side

30:33.176 --> 30:35.834
to take part in the
inquiry, I'm presuming?

30:37.697 --> 30:38.940
Then that's what we'll do.

30:43.151 --> 30:45.947
- We're about to have some
food, Marina. Will you stay?

30:47.500 --> 30:50.124
[water running]

30:54.714 --> 30:57.510
[plates clanking]

31:01.618 --> 31:02.515
- Everything okay?

31:07.589 --> 31:08.418
- Brent,

31:10.351 --> 31:13.319
for me and Anatoly,
this inquiry is easy.

31:14.769 --> 31:19.187
We stand in public and we say
Vladimir Putin is murderer.

31:19.912 --> 31:20.637
Because it is family.

31:22.363 --> 31:23.882
For other people, this is

31:25.469 --> 31:26.298
big risk.

31:27.540 --> 31:31.303
You must think about the
things closest to you.

31:31.303 --> 31:32.097
- Marina

31:34.340 --> 31:35.652
- The people you love.

31:37.309 --> 31:41.002
- We're giving evidence,
we're giving it everything,

31:41.002 --> 31:42.383
and we're doing it for you.

31:44.350 --> 31:45.144
End of.

31:46.939 --> 31:47.871
- You will?

31:49.114 --> 31:50.874
- You just try and stop him.

31:52.531 --> 31:55.154
[Marina laughs]

31:59.262 --> 32:02.092
- Marina, how are you feeling?
- All right now.

32:02.092 --> 32:04.612
Excuse us.
[reporters shouting]

32:04.612 --> 32:05.682
All right, come on now.

32:05.682 --> 32:08.029
That's enough. Excuse us.

32:08.029 --> 32:11.308
[reporters shouting]

32:11.308 --> 32:13.932
[somber music]

32:16.244 --> 32:17.659
- [Bailiff] Rise.

32:21.422 --> 32:24.839
[somber music continues]

32:30.534 --> 32:31.777
- Sir, my

32:32.881 --> 32:33.848
client,

32:34.883 --> 32:36.333
Mrs. Litvinenko,

32:37.748 --> 32:42.236
as you know, has fought
long and hard to reach this,

32:42.236 --> 32:45.480
the opening day of
a public inquiry

32:45.480 --> 32:48.173
into the assassination

32:48.173 --> 32:51.314
of her husband in 2006.

32:52.418 --> 32:53.695
That murder

32:53.695 --> 32:57.976
was an act of
unspeakable barbarism.

32:57.976 --> 33:01.531
The significance of this
dreadful murder, though,

33:01.531 --> 33:05.811
resonates far beyond those
immediately involved.

33:05.811 --> 33:09.366
It is a matter of grave national

33:09.366 --> 33:12.645
and international concern.

33:12.645 --> 33:17.443
On his deathbed, Mr. Litvinenko
accused Vladimir Putin

33:17.443 --> 33:20.308
of having ordered
his assassination,

33:20.308 --> 33:25.003
and we, sir, so on hearing all
the evidence out before you

33:25.003 --> 33:26.556
that you will conclude

33:29.110 --> 33:30.456
he was right about that.

33:32.355 --> 33:34.702
[people murmuring]

33:34.702 --> 33:36.428
[elevator dings]

33:36.428 --> 33:40.225
[cellphone ringing]

33:40.225 --> 33:41.329
- Brent.

33:41.329 --> 33:42.848
- Hello, Jim.

33:42.848 --> 33:44.643
Um, sorry to do this
out of the blue.

33:44.643 --> 33:46.231
The original
interview transcripts,

33:46.231 --> 33:47.749
how do I get those?

33:47.749 --> 33:50.269
- It'll be summaries on the
database of Operation Wimble.

33:50.269 --> 33:51.546
- No, not the summaries.

33:52.927 --> 33:53.755
The whole lot.

33:54.653 --> 33:55.619
- [Jim] How soon d'you need it?

33:55.619 --> 33:57.035
- How soon can you get them?

34:00.279 --> 34:04.421
- [Solicitor] Whenever
you're ready, I think.

34:04.421 --> 34:07.424
[people chattering]

34:12.878 --> 34:17.296
- Mrs. Litvinenko, when
you first met your husband,

34:17.296 --> 34:19.781
what did you understand
his job to be?

34:19.781 --> 34:22.784
- He was, uh, Special Unit,

34:22.784 --> 34:24.303
FSB.

34:24.303 --> 34:27.168
- But he had concerns over
corruption within the FSB,

34:27.168 --> 34:28.376
did he not,

34:28.376 --> 34:30.689
to the point where
he submitted a report

34:30.689 --> 34:32.691
to the head of the FSB?

34:32.691 --> 34:33.623
- That is correct.

34:35.142 --> 34:38.248
- Who was the head of
the FSB at that time?

34:39.939 --> 34:41.458
- Vladimir Putin.

34:43.011 --> 34:43.978
- [Robin] Thank you

34:47.050 --> 34:52.055
- Mrs. Litvinenko, when he
reported those concerns,

34:53.436 --> 34:56.715
did he think Mr. Putin
would act on them at all?

34:56.715 --> 34:57.854
- No.

34:57.854 --> 35:00.098
Very soon Sasha realized that

35:01.409 --> 35:04.619
Putin will not act
against these people.

35:04.619 --> 35:05.448
- No?

35:06.621 --> 35:07.415
Why?

35:08.554 --> 35:12.420
- Because Putin
knows these people.

35:12.420 --> 35:16.252
He protect them,
protect himself.

35:16.252 --> 35:19.117
- Putin was involved
in these plots.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.049
That was your husband's view.

35:22.465 --> 35:23.983
- Yes.

35:23.983 --> 35:26.089
- [Sir Robert] Thank
you very much indeed.

35:28.505 --> 35:31.129
[bright music]

35:38.308 --> 35:39.827
- [Ben] Sir, the next witnesses

35:39.827 --> 35:42.761
will be from the
Metropolitan Police,

35:42.761 --> 35:46.799
members of SO15
Counter Terrorism,

35:46.799 --> 35:51.079
and the detective who led the
murder investigation itself.

35:54.462 --> 35:57.362
- The polonium was found
in the Itsu restaurant,

35:57.362 --> 35:58.880
where Lugovoy and Kovtun ate,

35:59.985 --> 36:03.126
in the Millennium Hotel,
where they stayed,

36:04.231 --> 36:05.715
in the Pine Bar,
which they visited,

36:05.715 --> 36:08.166
at the table where they sat,

36:08.166 --> 36:09.581
in the teapot that they ordered,

36:09.581 --> 36:11.686
in the spout of the
teapot that they ordered,

36:11.686 --> 36:13.619
that was on the
table where they sat,

36:13.619 --> 36:15.690
in both their hotel rooms,

36:15.690 --> 36:20.005
in the U-bend of the basin
in Mr. Lugovoy's room,

36:20.005 --> 36:23.664
and, um, oh, several
other sites across London,

36:23.664 --> 36:25.528
too long to commit to memory.

36:25.528 --> 36:26.770
- Thank you-

36:26.770 --> 36:28.013
- Including the
seats they sat in

36:28.013 --> 36:30.257
on the flight they
flew in on from Moscow.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.707
- Thank you Mr. Timmons.

36:32.707 --> 36:35.434
[brooding music]

36:41.371 --> 36:44.202
- Lugovoy was career KGB.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.100
Mr. Litvinenko mentioned
that in his statement,

36:46.100 --> 36:49.068
but we, of course, carried
out our own investigations,

36:49.068 --> 36:50.518
and were able to verify that.

36:51.933 --> 36:54.522
And if I may, it's worth
saying that, just this week,

36:54.522 --> 36:56.559
Mr. Lugovoy was given a medal

36:56.559 --> 36:58.940
for services to the motherland.

36:59.872 --> 37:02.220
- And you mention that...

37:02.220 --> 37:05.119
- We just all thought it was
curious timing, that's all.

37:06.500 --> 37:10.366
- [Robin] You interviewed
Mr. Lugovoy in December 2006?

37:10.366 --> 37:11.815
- Yes, that is correct.

37:11.815 --> 37:13.231
- Am I right in saying

37:13.231 --> 37:14.887
there is no tape recording
of that interview?

37:16.061 --> 37:18.408
- I'm afraid that
is also correct.

37:18.408 --> 37:20.445
- [Robin] That is
unfortunate, is it not?

37:22.309 --> 37:24.034
- That would be
an understatement.

37:26.554 --> 37:29.247
- Now, since you paused Mr. Tam,

37:29.247 --> 37:30.903
may I ask

37:30.903 --> 37:32.767
Mr. Tarpey,

37:32.767 --> 37:35.598
is it right to say
that it's not the case

37:35.598 --> 37:37.289
that there was no tape?

37:37.289 --> 37:39.464
- Yes, there was
a physical tape.

37:39.464 --> 37:42.363
- There was a tape
provided by the Russians

37:42.363 --> 37:45.746
that purported to
be of Mr. Lugovoy,

37:45.746 --> 37:50.751
but which was later found to
be blank, or wiped, perhaps.

37:51.476 --> 37:52.925
- Yes, that is correct.

37:53.961 --> 37:56.653
- An important
clarification, I think.

38:02.521 --> 38:05.731
- Mr. Hyatt, the interviews
that you conducted

38:05.731 --> 38:08.389
with Mr. Litvinenko in hospital,

38:08.389 --> 38:11.289
do you have the
transcripts with you there?

38:11.289 --> 38:14.326
Now, for this section,
sir, unusually,

38:14.326 --> 38:16.190
we will be educing evidence

38:16.190 --> 38:19.745
relating to the death
of Mr. Litvinenko

38:20.781 --> 38:23.542
from Mr. Litvinenko himself.

38:24.716 --> 38:26.994
The suggestion is
that Mr. Hyatt read

38:26.994 --> 38:29.445
some of his questions
aloud for the court

38:29.445 --> 38:33.656
and that I shall read the
answers given by Mr. Litvinenko.

38:33.656 --> 38:36.037
Starting then, Mr. Hyatt.

38:37.832 --> 38:39.213
- Um. [clears throat]

38:39.213 --> 38:42.423
At the bottom of page 078,

38:42.423 --> 38:44.322
I'm asking Sasha about the work

38:44.322 --> 38:46.289
he was asked to do by the FSB.

38:48.187 --> 38:50.466
"Your job was to kill.

38:50.466 --> 38:52.985
That's what you're saying. Who?"

38:53.848 --> 38:57.265
- "Enemies of the Russian state.

38:57.265 --> 39:01.339
They give me names.
They must be killed.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.618
That is why I am here today."

39:04.618 --> 39:06.344
- "Because you killed?"

39:06.344 --> 39:08.760
- "Because I refuse.

39:08.760 --> 39:11.521
This job is not human.

39:11.521 --> 39:13.903
FSB is corrupt.

39:13.903 --> 39:17.216
I want to tell
this to the world."

39:17.216 --> 39:21.635
- Then further on at 085,

39:21.635 --> 39:23.706
I say to him,

39:23.706 --> 39:25.777
"You became a target.

39:25.777 --> 39:29.021
They sent someone
over to London."

39:29.021 --> 39:31.058
Uh, Sasha agreed with that,

39:31.058 --> 39:32.991
said he thought
someone had been sent

39:32.991 --> 39:35.545
from Moscow to poison him.

39:35.545 --> 39:38.928
Then my colleague,
Jim Dawson, asks,

39:38.928 --> 39:42.725
"Do you have any idea who
might have ordered this?"

39:43.933 --> 39:47.005
- "I know the man who
makes order for this,

39:47.005 --> 39:50.215
the man who says I must die."

39:50.215 --> 39:53.632
- "You have a name?
Let's start with a name."

39:53.632 --> 39:54.599
- "His name,

39:57.464 --> 39:59.397
Vladimir Putin."

39:59.397 --> 40:01.640
[ominous music]

40:01.640 --> 40:06.645
[rain pouring]
[thunder cracking]

40:09.061 --> 40:12.548
[ominous music continues]

40:14.342 --> 40:15.723
- [Sir Robert] Mr. Emmerson.

40:17.276 --> 40:20.487
- Sir, the final chapter
will come, of course,

40:20.487 --> 40:22.627
when you deliver your report.

40:24.042 --> 40:27.355
But the evidence here,
sir, is utterly objective,

40:28.529 --> 40:29.496
utterly damning,

40:30.876 --> 40:34.259
and it has the simplicity
of undeniable fact.

40:35.398 --> 40:37.124
Polonium-210

40:37.124 --> 40:39.195
is only manufactured

40:40.299 --> 40:41.162
in Russia,

40:42.370 --> 40:45.373
in a tightly-controlled
state facility

40:46.409 --> 40:47.341
in Russia.

40:48.549 --> 40:50.655
In the hands of Mr.
Lugovoy, Mr. Kovtun,

40:50.655 --> 40:53.278
and Mr. Putin, therefore,

40:53.278 --> 40:55.694
it's not simply a murder weapon

40:58.179 --> 41:00.043
but also a calling card.

41:03.150 --> 41:04.427
- Mr. Emmerson, thank you.

41:09.812 --> 41:13.332
[ominous music continues]

41:19.649 --> 41:20.478
- What Now?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.135
- Now we wait for his judgment.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.830
- To judge the judge.

41:27.830 --> 41:28.727
- [Ben] Exactly.

41:34.699 --> 41:37.115
[door opens]

41:40.670 --> 41:43.362
[Marina groans]

41:46.745 --> 41:48.506
[intercom ringing]

41:48.506 --> 41:51.509
[ominous music]

41:51.509 --> 41:52.302
- Hello?

41:56.375 --> 41:59.827
[ominous music continues]

42:01.449 --> 42:02.968
- Mum.

42:02.968 --> 42:05.384
[door opens]

42:07.248 --> 42:10.735
[ominous music continues]

42:13.082 --> 42:16.257
[streetlamps buzzing]

42:20.814 --> 42:24.542
[Marina speaking in Russian]

42:30.548 --> 42:31.652
You stop.

42:32.757 --> 42:34.552
I will never stop.

42:35.622 --> 42:38.797
[streetlamps buzzing]

42:44.182 --> 42:46.633
[door slams]

42:46.633 --> 42:49.256
[somber music]

42:57.540 --> 43:01.682
[somber music continues]

43:01.682 --> 43:04.720
- The inquiry has found
that Mr. Litvinenko

43:04.720 --> 43:06.653
was deliberately poisoned

43:06.653 --> 43:09.828
by Andrey Lugovoy
and Dmitry Kovtun.

43:11.278 --> 43:14.626
The inquiry has also found
that Lugovoy and Kovtun

43:14.626 --> 43:16.594
were acting on behalf of others

43:16.594 --> 43:19.597
when they poisoned
Mr. Litvinenko.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.529
There is a strong probability

43:21.529 --> 43:23.324
that they were acting
under the direction

43:23.324 --> 43:26.017
of the Russian domestic
security service,

43:26.017 --> 43:28.606
the Federal Security
Service, or FSB.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.609
And the inquiry has found

43:31.609 --> 43:35.682
that the FSB operation
to kill Mr. Litvinenko

43:35.682 --> 43:38.685
was probably approved
by Mr. Patrushev,

43:38.685 --> 43:41.446
the then head of the FSB,

43:41.446 --> 43:43.655
and by President Putin.

[Marina speaking in Russian]

[Alex speaking in Russian]

43:54.321 --> 43:55.149
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:59.809 --> 44:00.948
Why?

44:00.948 --> 44:01.742
What is this?

44:04.055 --> 44:05.953
Why you hide this from me?

44:10.026 --> 44:11.027
When are you due?

44:11.027 --> 44:11.856
- Any day now.

44:12.857 --> 44:13.789
A little boy.

44:14.962 --> 44:16.239
And, well,

44:17.585 --> 44:19.415
we were hoping...

44:19.415 --> 44:20.899
- Um, we were hoping,

44:22.004 --> 44:22.970
if you'd be so kind,

44:22.970 --> 44:25.317
as to give us your blessing, um,

44:26.664 --> 44:27.906
to name him Sasha.

44:29.908 --> 44:32.670
