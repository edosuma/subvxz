00:17.951 --> 00:19.151
<i>My name is ichabod crane.</i>

00:19.153 --> 00:20.619
<i>I became a spy</i>
<i>under the command</i>

00:20.621 --> 00:21.787
<i>Of general washington.</i>

00:21.789 --> 00:22.788
George washington.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.956
Do you know him?

00:23.958 --> 00:24.990
Crane:
<i>In 1781,</i>

00:24.992 --> 00:27.459
<i>I died on the battlefield.</i>

00:27.461 --> 00:29.795
<i>But I was saved</i>
<i>by a mysterious spell</i>

00:29.797 --> 00:32.965
<i>Cast upon me by</i>
<i>my beloved wife katrina.</i>

00:32.967 --> 00:35.968
<i>Now I've been awakened</i>
<i>250 years later</i>

00:35.970 --> 00:38.871
<i>In a land</i>
<i>I no longer recognize.</i>

00:38.873 --> 00:40.205
You've been emancipated,
I take it.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.707
Excuse me?

00:41.709 --> 00:43.042
From enslavement.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.377
<i>And fate led me</i>
<i>to miss abigail mills,</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:46.478
<i>A young police lieutenant</i>

00:46.480 --> 00:48.881
<i>Investigating</i>
<i>baffling mysteries.</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:51.383
The horseman has been awakened,
and you along with him.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.986
Crane:
<i>We are now bearing witness</i>
<i>to strange events</i>

00:53.988 --> 00:55.554
<i>And dark forces</i>
<i>that I would not believe</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:57.556
<i>Had I not seen</i>
<i>with my own eyes.</i>

00:57.558 --> 00:59.491
<i>They foretell that</i>
<i>our realm is in danger,</i>

00:59.493 --> 01:02.661
<i>And the apocalypse</i>
<i>may be upon us.</i>

01:02.663 --> 01:05.064
Revelation?
This speaks of
two witnesses.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.732
You were called
to something, abbie.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.833
<i>We both were.</i>

01:07.835 --> 01:09.401
<i>Our destinies are entwined.</i>

01:09.403 --> 01:10.836
<i>We're on the battleground</i>

01:10.838 --> 01:12.404
<i>Where the armies</i>
<i>of good and evil</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:14.907
<i>Will wage war</i>
<i>for the fate of mankind:</i>

01:14.909 --> 01:16.909
<i>Sleepy hollow.</i>

01:18.011 --> 01:20.179
<i>Previously on</i> sleepy hollow...

01:20.181 --> 01:21.246
Crane:
<i>This home belonged</i>
<i>to sheriff corbin.</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:25.350
(automatic gunfire)

01:25.352 --> 01:28.520
A bible was buried here with me
<i>with this passage marked.</i>

01:28.522 --> 01:31.090
This tells of the four horsemen
<i>of the apocalypse.</i>

01:31.092 --> 01:33.559
Katrina:
<i>Conquest, war, famine</i>
<i>and death, ichabod.</i>

01:33.561 --> 01:35.694
Together, they will unleash
the apocalypse.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.362
The hessian's
final words were,

01:37.364 --> 01:39.098
<i>"moloch shall rise."</i>

01:39.100 --> 01:42.034
This is the creature you saw
in the forest, miss mills.

01:42.036 --> 01:43.435
The one who controls
the horsemen,

01:43.437 --> 01:45.037
<i>Who guards katrina.</i>

01:45.039 --> 01:46.805
And now we know
his name.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.443
(birds twittering)

02:05.225 --> 02:07.693
(humming)

02:18.738 --> 02:20.572
Girl:
Hi.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.074
Are you lost?

02:22.076 --> 02:24.743
Want to play?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.745
I bet you can't

02:26.747 --> 02:28.614
Catch me!

02:28.616 --> 02:30.149
(giggling)

02:31.251 --> 02:33.685
Come on!
It's okay!

02:34.787 --> 02:37.156
(giggling)

02:47.000 --> 02:49.668
(hoofbeats approaching)

03:17.030 --> 03:19.531
â™ª

03:27.173 --> 03:29.708
(crickets chirping)

03:32.845 --> 03:36.315
Are you sure you want
to stay in this old cabin?

03:36.317 --> 03:39.151
It's a bit of
a fixer-upper.

03:39.153 --> 03:42.221
You and I have very different
definitions of "old."

03:42.223 --> 03:44.656
It seems if a building
stays upright

03:44.658 --> 03:46.225
For more than a decade,

03:46.227 --> 03:48.293
You people declare it
a national landmark.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.163
No.

03:51.165 --> 03:54.032
This cabin has all
the modern means I need.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.468
It's certainly preferable
to that motel.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.072
You know, we could
spackle the bullet holes.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.007
Unless you want
to keep them.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.342
No, no.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.678
By all means,
we'll... Spackle.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.080
You know
you can admit

04:08.082 --> 04:10.515
When you don't know
what a word means.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.684
This is the ideal setting
for you, though.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.353
It's rustic,

04:14.355 --> 04:16.421
By the lake...

04:17.523 --> 04:19.891
Maybe corbin meant for us

04:19.893 --> 04:21.393
To find this place.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.395
An act of faith?

04:23.397 --> 04:26.031
That's unusual,
coming from you.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.033
It's true.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.401
Never been
a big believer

04:29.403 --> 04:31.570
Of what
I can't see.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.072
And the irony isn't
lost on me, okay?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.741
I get I'm supposed
to be a player

04:35.743 --> 04:37.409
In the big guy's
endgame, but...

04:37.411 --> 04:39.244
I'm not ready
to abandon

04:39.246 --> 04:41.813
My better judgment outright.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.053
What is this
impenetrable barrier

04:48.055 --> 04:49.254
Around this
instrument?

04:49.256 --> 04:51.890
It's called
plastic.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.458
That's why
I bought scissors.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.898
Miss mills...

04:59.900 --> 05:02.134
Do you think I look
out of place in this century?

05:02.136 --> 05:04.069
You look good for 200.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.737
But a change of
clothes wouldn't hurt.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.072
Luke (over radio):
Unit 27,

05:07.074 --> 05:08.307
Citizen flag down.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.741
Boy unconscious and breathing.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.243
Requesting an r/a

05:11.245 --> 05:12.644
And additional unit
to market and fifth.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.146
Lieutenant mills.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.647
I have a close eta.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.015
Show me en route.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.584
It's a routine call.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.153
I think routine

05:21.155 --> 05:22.654
Is a thing of
the past for us.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.327
(indistinct radio transmissions)

05:44.277 --> 05:45.610
What have we got?

05:45.612 --> 05:47.112
The boy was seen
stumbling down the street.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.447
Then he just
passed out.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.283
Mail carrier over
there called it in.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.318
Mail carrier:
I saw him along
my route earlier.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.121
He was coming out of the woods
by rockefeller preserve.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.956
Anyone with him?
No.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.958
Witnesses say
he was unaccompanied.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.961
Wish I could say
the same for you.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.996
Don't you get tired
of being a babysitter?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.298
You know,
for a detective,

06:06.300 --> 06:07.632
You really don't
have a clue.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.368
Lieutenant.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.972
The boy's hands.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.041
Blackening
veins.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.144
Is this condition
common in this time?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.879
Abbie:
Not in the slightest.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.147
The garments
he's wearing...

06:22.149 --> 06:25.217
Their simplicity...

06:25.219 --> 06:27.018
He looks like he got lost

06:27.020 --> 06:28.754
On his way back from
a renaissance faire.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.958
(breathing rapidly, gasps)

06:35.695 --> 06:38.363
<i>Euel perne.</i>

06:38.365 --> 06:42.868
Did he just say <i>euel perne?</i>

06:42.870 --> 06:44.669
I take it
that means something to you.

06:44.671 --> 06:48.240
Yes, it's a language you, too,
are familiar with.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.275
English.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.846
<i>Hwon be pa euel perne?</i>

06:54.848 --> 06:57.115
We've got to
get him loaded.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.088
Abbie:
That is not
any english

07:03.090 --> 07:04.856
We speak around here.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.526
That's because
it's middle english.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.495
The sort only spoken
in the middle ages.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.586
Hundreds of children go
missing in this country?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.920
Sadly, yes.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.256
It's called kidnapping.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.591
And though I'm
hoping this boy

08:12.593 --> 08:13.925
Isn't a victim,

08:13.927 --> 08:16.261
We keep a database
of all reported abductions

08:16.263 --> 08:18.129
And this could be
our only way to id him.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.931
Irving: Until then,
he's a john doe

08:19.933 --> 08:21.800
At westchester memorial,
and we've got no way

08:21.802 --> 08:23.268
To explain
what's happening to him.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.437
John doe is what
we call somebody...

08:25.439 --> 08:27.305
Someone whose identity
is unknown, yes.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.140
The term came into being
in britain, thank you.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.610
Long before
my time.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.778
As is his language,
captain.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.814
The boy speaks
middle english.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.982
Naturally.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.684
I... Studied it
at oxford.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.186
It's the language
of chaucer's

08:41.188 --> 08:42.954
<i>Canterbury tales,</i>
<i>for example.</i>

08:42.956 --> 08:44.656
So did the boy go to oxford,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.691
Or are you suggesting
that we're dealing with someone

08:46.693 --> 08:48.360
From king arthur's court?

08:52.131 --> 08:55.300
All I can tell you is the boy
said, <i>"euel perne,"</i>

08:55.302 --> 08:57.202
Which means "evil girl"

08:57.204 --> 08:59.170
In a dead version
of our language.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.640
Any leads I'm
going to like?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.808
No trace of him

09:03.810 --> 09:05.043
In the national database.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.545
Nobody's looking for him.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.013
Morales has even tried

09:08.015 --> 09:09.514
Local amish communities.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.216
It seems his identity
is as much of a mystery

09:11.218 --> 09:12.484
As his disorder.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.719
I've contacted the cdc.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.322
Centers for disease control.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.723
This cdc...

09:18.725 --> 09:20.559
Do they think the
illness could spread?

09:20.561 --> 09:22.994
When I described the black
veining on the boy's arms,

09:22.996 --> 09:24.229
They said they'd send someone

09:24.231 --> 09:25.497
To take a look.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.698
We don't want
an epidemic.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.400
Brush up on your chaucer, crane.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.135
I need you to question
our john doe.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.305
Hey, captain.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.708
What's on your
mind, morales?

09:36.710 --> 09:37.909
Well, sir,

09:37.911 --> 09:40.345
It's a small town.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.913
There's been a lot of talk.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.015
About...?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.717
Well, this guy crane.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.052
He was a suspect.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.020
Now he's a consultant?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.555
What's he doing here?

09:50.557 --> 09:54.125
You and lieutenant mills
have... History.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.229
Is that gonna cause
a problem, morales?

09:58.231 --> 09:59.898
No, sir.
Good.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.033
Crane's knowledge
of the beheadings

10:02.035 --> 10:04.402
Makes him an important
advisor to me right now.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.538
So until we catch
the perp behind them,

10:06.540 --> 10:09.441
I'd advise you to stay
focused on your work.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.143
Yes, sir.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.898
This is the stuff
of nightmares.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.467
Woman:
Mills, we're ready for you now.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.068
This isolation will
only scare him more.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.737
They have to do it.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.572
The plastic barriers keeps
the contaminated air contained.

10:40.574 --> 10:41.906
Yes, plastic.

10:41.908 --> 10:45.744
How did we survive without it?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.646
You will speak
into this camera.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.981
Here's what I need
to know for starters:

10:49.983 --> 10:52.417
What did the vector eat,
what drugs has he tried,

10:52.419 --> 10:54.152
Where's he from,
and where's he been.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.921
While you may see in there
a nameless, faceless source,

10:56.923 --> 11:00.825
I see a boy, and I intend
to treat him as such.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.328
Whatever it takes.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.454
Thomas.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.223
Thomas grey.

11:47.139 --> 11:49.207
Thank you.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.507
It seems he was forbidden
from leaving his home.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.242
We see this
all the time.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.512
People, monsters,
keep kids caged up.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.347
Threaten them
if they break rules.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.683
And teach them middle english?

12:31.685 --> 12:33.551
Maybe. That's one way

12:33.553 --> 12:35.420
Of keep them
from asking for help.

12:35.422 --> 12:39.858
Or the boy is lost and
disoriented by his surroundings.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.393
I think most of us
can relate to that.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.130
Where's he from?
I need a location.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.640
Roanoke?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.543
I need all
the hospitals

12:58.545 --> 13:00.245
Contacted in
roanoke, virginia.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.081
Find everything going in
and out of their doors.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.217
I'll have the department
contact local law enforcement.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.119
Track down his family.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.590
No... I think parsons
may be looking

13:12.592 --> 13:14.726
In the wrong place.

13:14.728 --> 13:17.228
The boy did say
roanoke, right?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.063
But I don't think
thomas meant a roanoke

13:19.065 --> 13:21.733
You'd find on today's map.

13:21.735 --> 13:26.905
The older version of english,
his antiquated appearance...

13:26.907 --> 13:31.576
What if thomas
is from the lost colony?

13:31.578 --> 13:34.579
What lost colony?

13:34.581 --> 13:37.115
Crane: <i>Roanoke was the very</i>
<i>first british colony</i>

13:37.117 --> 13:40.585
<i>In the new world,</i>
<i>led by governor john white.</i>

13:40.587 --> 13:43.121
In fact, white's daughter
and her husband produced

13:43.123 --> 13:45.757
The very first
american-born colonist,

13:45.759 --> 13:48.626
<i>Their daughter, virginia dare.</i>

13:48.628 --> 13:51.429
So, white returned
to europe

13:51.431 --> 13:53.431
For provisions
for the colony.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.268
And when he got back to roanoke,
everyone was gone?

13:57.270 --> 13:58.770
Crane:
<i>Not a single person was there.</i>

13:58.772 --> 14:00.438
<i>They had disappeared.</i>

14:00.440 --> 14:03.441
<i>It became known</i>
<i>as the lost colony.</i>

14:03.443 --> 14:04.943
That's pretty weird.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.778
We still haven't found 'em.

14:06.780 --> 14:10.181
Perhaps, because they've
relocated to sleepy hollow.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.684
Whoa.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.787
True, we found a kid
that looks like

14:15.789 --> 14:17.455
He stepped off
the    <i>mayflower,</i>

14:17.457 --> 14:19.023
But that does not mean

14:19.025 --> 14:21.693
That a colony that vanished
from north carolina

14:21.695 --> 14:25.129
400 years ago has relocated
to the neighborhood.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.965
I did say "perhaps," lieutenant.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.535
And I can name a few
stranger turns of events.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.303
You really believe
anything is possible.

14:32.305 --> 14:36.140
My own circumstance makes me
open to the prospect.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.376
(phone rings)

14:39.378 --> 14:42.981
Sir, I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.650
Irving:
Thomas' disease is starting
to spread.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.686
The black veining has taken over
more of his body, and

14:48.688 --> 14:51.055
<i>The emt who treated the boy</i>
<i>collapsed ten minutes ago.</i>

14:51.057 --> 14:53.358
<i>He's been infected.</i>

14:53.360 --> 14:55.894
He's deteriorating rapidly.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.396
A couple of nurses have been
feeling ill.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.064
This may be an outbreak.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.367
Captain, we are onto a theory.
And we will get

15:02.369 --> 15:04.402
Right back to you
as soon as we do

15:04.404 --> 15:05.737
Some more digging.
Thank you, sir.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.538
Well, we had better
dig quickly.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.241
If thomas does indeed
carry a plague--

15:10.243 --> 15:11.910
And one from half
a millennium ago--

15:11.912 --> 15:16.381
The effects could be
apocalyptic.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.050
Okay. We'll start looking in
the woods where they found him.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.886
And perhaps...

15:21.888 --> 15:25.790
Perhaps we will find
the lost colony of roanoke.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.628
(rapid beeping)

15:36.568 --> 15:39.637
(approaching hoofbeats)

15:41.907 --> 15:44.809
(beeping becomes steady tone)

15:49.381 --> 15:51.416
Abbie:
<i>Word must have spread</i>
<i>about the virus.</i>

15:51.418 --> 15:52.884
<i>Looks like people</i>
<i>are leaving town.</i>

15:52.886 --> 15:54.786
Crane:
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

15:57.556 --> 15:59.157
(abbie groans)

15:59.758 --> 16:02.060
So, here we are.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.729
This is where
the mail carrier saw thomas,

16:04.731 --> 16:06.898
Right near the
"welcome to roanoke" sign.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.468
Yours isn't the
first generation
to invent sarcasm.

16:12.571 --> 16:17.241
So who was more sarcastic,
jefferson or adams?

16:17.243 --> 16:19.410
Is this more sarcasm?

16:19.412 --> 16:23.781
No, I'm serious.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.283
I'm not saying.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.752
Come on. Please?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.754
I'll tell you this:

16:29.756 --> 16:33.257
Jefferson had an
obsession with puns,

16:33.259 --> 16:36.427
And adams kept a notebook
of unsavory limericks.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.396
Seriously?

16:39.331 --> 16:42.033
Welcome to roanoke.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.270
Abbie:
<i>According to my phone's</i>
<i>compass app,</i>

16:46.272 --> 16:48.639
We're heading due east.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.441
That much
I can tell you.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.111
Just not sure if we're heading
in the right direction...

16:53.113 --> 16:55.113
If there is one.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.950
I suspect there is,
and we are on it.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.618
Look.

17:00.620 --> 17:04.122
This spiderweb has been broken
at about thomas' height,

17:04.124 --> 17:06.290
And these footfalls are the same

17:06.292 --> 17:08.326
I've been tracking
since we began.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.328
I'm afraid your so-called

17:10.330 --> 17:12.330
Smart phone couldn't
tell you that.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.466
Look at you,
copping some 'tude.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.969
There's more.

17:17.971 --> 17:19.637
Jones, morales, meet me

17:19.639 --> 17:21.039
At westchester memorial
in 30 minutes.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.974
We got to compare
notes with the cdc.

17:22.976 --> 17:24.375
You got it, captain.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.146
Did you talk to him about
bringing the new guys in?

17:28.148 --> 17:30.314
Yeah.
What'd he say?

17:30.316 --> 17:32.717
Basically, to keep our heads
down and do as we're told.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.218
Fine by me.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.387
Let's keep the captain
on our good side.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.656
He's axing us out.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.158
Hey, score enough points,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.393
Maybe me and you move on
to bigger and better.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.895
Think about it. Nypd.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.664
What does an oxford history
professor know

17:46.666 --> 17:48.066
About serial killings
in sleepy hollow?

17:48.068 --> 17:51.002
If he even is
who he says.

17:51.004 --> 17:54.405
(quietly):
Obviously the captain knows
something we don't.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.340
Just let it go.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.709
I'll meet you at the hospital.
I'm gonna make some calls.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.144
All right.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.022
<i>Mimosa pudica.</i>

18:11.024 --> 18:14.926
It closes up for days
in response to human touch.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.435
Thomas has been here.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.605
Seriously, where did you learn
to track like this?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.208
Foxhunting, actually.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.243
Excuse me.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.412
Mm. My father
was a nobleman.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.915
I had a rather regal upbringing.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.685
That's one thing I'm pleased
to have left behind.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.225
These footprints
are different from thomas'.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.726
Right.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.561
He was barefoot.
You can see

18:50.563 --> 18:53.064
The outline of his toes,
but not in these.

18:53.066 --> 18:56.234
Maybe they belong to
the girl he mentioned.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.402
The evil girl.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.938
They stop out of nowhere.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.673
Where did she go?

19:04.243 --> 19:07.745
Perhaps she was never
even here to begin with.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.413
Look...

19:09.415 --> 19:11.916
Lost colony or not,

19:11.918 --> 19:13.618
We have to be prepared

19:13.620 --> 19:17.622
For whatever's on
the other side of that trail.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.190
Are you all right?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.227
Let's keep going.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.766
Luke:
We've got two more patients.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.801
Both on the scene
when the boy went down.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.670
Parsons:
<i>Are we any closer to knowing</i>

19:32.672 --> 19:34.105
Where patient zero came from?

19:34.107 --> 19:35.439
Still searching.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.308
We're working on a
possible bioterrorism angle.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.277
Looked into a new cult
that's surfaced.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.678
So far, no link to them.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.113
Why do the others seem more sick

19:42.115 --> 19:43.948
<i>Than the kid?</i>

19:43.950 --> 19:45.449
Parsons:
<i>People's immune systems</i>
<i>react differently.</i>

19:45.451 --> 19:46.651
Some may not be affected.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.953
Others may be completely
compromised.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.123
The vector must come
from a very different
environment than ours.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.491
Why is that?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.193
His blood panels.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.961
<i>They show traces</i>
<i>of foreign antibodies</i>

19:56.963 --> 19:59.130
And a lack of others
present in our population.

19:59.132 --> 20:02.967
There's no evidence
he's ever been vaccinated
against anything.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.703
To inoculate everyone else
against this thing,

20:05.705 --> 20:07.371
We need to identify it.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.707
We're coming across nothing
like it in our database.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.377
I have officers retracing
the boy's trail as we speak.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.225
This is where
thomas' trail ends.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.094
Or... More
accurately, begins.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.864
I believe the answer
to his survival lies

20:33.866 --> 20:36.300
Somewhere
over there.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.703
Abbie:
That tiny island?

20:38.705 --> 20:39.737
Crane:
Mm-hmm.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.906
There's nothing
on it.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.175
Looks can be deceiving,
lieutenant.

20:44.177 --> 20:45.743
Perhaps this is how
the community

20:45.745 --> 20:47.245
Has remained hidden.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.180
Sure. Maybe.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.514
Are you telling me

20:50.516 --> 20:52.083
You think the kid
swam across this?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.418
No...

20:54.420 --> 20:56.254
No, his feet were
covered in muck,

20:56.256 --> 20:58.756
But not the
rest of him.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.101
Okay.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.939
We're gonna have to find
another way over there.

21:21.246 --> 21:22.613
Crane. Crane!

21:27.753 --> 21:30.254
This is how thomas
made it across.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.089
How did you know that?

21:32.091 --> 21:34.759
Markings on these trees

21:34.761 --> 21:36.294
Indicate a hidden crossing.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.964
Step this way,
miss mills.

22:09.261 --> 22:11.829
(birds chirping,
insects trilling)

22:24.976 --> 22:27.778
What is this place?

22:27.780 --> 22:30.214
(conversing quietly)

22:37.322 --> 22:40.358
Abbie:
Crane... They're all infected.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.703
(colonists conversing quietly)

22:58.176 --> 23:00.711
Abbie:
They have the black veins,
but don't seem sick.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.546
Crane:
Yes. Quite curious.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.328
So this is where
thomas was raised.

23:17.330 --> 23:19.497
In a community
that hasn't changed

23:19.499 --> 23:22.400
In some 400 years.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.602
How is that
possible?

23:48.693 --> 23:51.796
Virginia dare.

24:00.739 --> 24:03.040
The spirit of virginia dare

24:03.042 --> 24:04.875
Guided the colonists here

24:04.877 --> 24:07.111
To protect them.
Protect them?

24:07.113 --> 24:08.946
But they all have
the disease.

24:51.923 --> 24:54.191
(murmuring)

24:58.263 --> 25:00.598
The spirit of virginia dare
seems to watch over them here,

25:00.600 --> 25:03.434
Keeping their symptoms at bay.

25:03.436 --> 25:04.768
Sort of like katrina

25:04.770 --> 25:06.337
Putting a spell on you

25:06.339 --> 25:08.939
To keep
you alive.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.342
It seems the colonists
of roanoke and I

25:11.344 --> 25:13.677
Share much in common.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.449
In order to save thomas,
we must bring him back.

25:18.451 --> 25:20.284
I'm no middle english expert,

25:20.286 --> 25:22.119
But I could've sworn

25:22.121 --> 25:23.821
I heard the word "horseman"
thrown in there.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.356
Indeed you did,

25:25.358 --> 25:26.657
Though not
the headless one

25:26.659 --> 25:27.992
With whom we
are acquainted.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.160
The colony was infected
with this plague

25:30.162 --> 25:32.463
By the horseman
of pestilence,

25:32.465 --> 25:34.298
Also known as
conquest.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.800
So another horseman of
the apocalypse has arrived?

25:36.802 --> 25:38.302
Not yet.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.971
And not if we
can stop it.

25:40.973 --> 25:45.009
Pestilence instituted
this plague centuries ago,

25:45.011 --> 25:47.144
But the roanoke colony
contained it,

25:47.146 --> 25:48.512
Stopping its spread
and thwarting

25:48.514 --> 25:50.581
The horseman
from riding forth.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.885
It's been unleashed
anew through thomas.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.222
If it manages
to spread this time...

25:58.224 --> 25:59.523
Then the horseman
of pestilence

25:59.525 --> 26:01.025
Will come to
sleepy hollow

26:01.027 --> 26:03.060
And join forces with
the horseman of death.

26:05.163 --> 26:08.165
We must prevent this
at all costs.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.334
And I think
bringing thomas here

26:10.336 --> 26:11.936
Will be the answer.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.720
No, thank you.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.789
You keep it.

26:35.393 --> 26:38.095
(slow hoofbeats echo)

26:41.232 --> 26:43.033
Crane.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.301
We gotta get going.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.400
Oh, my god,
you're infected.

27:16.402 --> 27:20.070
Be it the protection
of virginia dare,

27:20.072 --> 27:22.806
Or something in
the environment,

27:22.808 --> 27:25.409
The cure seems to lie
within the colony.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.077
Maybe, but the cdc

27:27.079 --> 27:28.779
Is not going to let
anyone leave the hospital.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.314
And how are we
supposed to get
them to a place

27:30.316 --> 27:31.849
That no one
believes exists?

27:39.958 --> 27:42.092
It's spreading.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.594
Crane:
Miss mills...

27:43.596 --> 27:45.996
These people are
going to die here.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.465
Do you think
the roanoke remedy

27:48.467 --> 27:51.368
Would even work on
people other than thomas?

27:53.438 --> 27:55.339
Crane?

27:57.642 --> 27:59.777
I've been infected.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.478
It was the colony.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.780
Get me a hazmat team in here,

28:02.782 --> 28:03.981
On the
double.
No.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.949
No, I think it was earlier...

28:05.951 --> 28:07.851
<i>When I first</i>
<i>encountered thomas.</i>

28:10.955 --> 28:12.289
Get him into quarantine.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.158
No. No, I feel perfectly fine.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.459
Listen to him.

28:15.461 --> 28:16.794
Don't touch him.
Do not take him!

28:16.796 --> 28:18.462
Stay back, he's contagious.

28:18.464 --> 28:19.697
Stop this!

28:19.699 --> 28:21.799
No! I must
help thomas!
Sedate him!

28:21.801 --> 28:23.634
No, I just... Please!

28:23.636 --> 28:25.035
Abbie:
No!

28:43.988 --> 28:46.457
(wind whistling)

28:58.002 --> 28:59.670
Katrina.

28:59.672 --> 29:00.871
Ichabod?

29:00.873 --> 29:02.306
Are you
really here?

29:10.348 --> 29:12.182
You're not well.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.518
How did you know?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.820
Because you're here.

29:17.856 --> 29:19.890
But I have
been here before.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.192
Only when
I've summoned you.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.062
I've... I've not been
able to for some time.

29:25.064 --> 29:28.365
If you are here
in any other way...

29:28.367 --> 29:31.535
It means that
you are dead.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.971
Or near to it.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.982
(phone ringing)

29:46.251 --> 29:47.751
Detective morales.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.086
Woman (british accent):
Yes, hello, detective.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.554
I'm calling from
the history department

29:50.556 --> 29:52.389
Of oxford's merton college

29:52.391 --> 29:54.291
Regarding your inquiry
into a mr. Ichabod crane.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.726
Yes.

29:55.728 --> 29:57.461
He is indeed
a tenured professor here,

29:57.463 --> 29:59.229
On sabbatical at the moment,

29:59.231 --> 30:01.899
And on loan to law enforcement
in westchester county, new york.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.567
I see.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.068
Is there anything else
I may be of assistance with?

30:05.070 --> 30:06.770
No. No, no.
Thank you.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.972
That's all
I needed to know.

30:10.074 --> 30:11.942
Everything okay,
morales?

30:11.944 --> 30:13.911
Yes, sir.
All good.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.579
Track down parsons
from cdc.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.748
We need to make a plan
to control public response.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.650
Yes, sir.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.592
Katrina:
<i>You must understand.</i>

30:28.594 --> 30:29.927
It's only under
great duress

30:29.929 --> 30:32.262
You would find
yourself here.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.431
I am sick.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.301
I did not realize
how critically.

30:37.303 --> 30:40.103
Another has died from this.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.940
And I fear you will, too.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.108
Ichabod, this place
I've been trapped in,

30:45.110 --> 30:46.677
It's purgatory.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.613
Purgatory?

30:49.615 --> 30:51.448
Then those are...

30:51.450 --> 30:53.183
Souls.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.786
Who've been collected here.

30:55.788 --> 30:59.523
We're all trapped together,
and yet very much apart.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.626
Those there are moving on.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.361
To where?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.930
To wherever he determines.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.633
He?

31:09.635 --> 31:13.704
The beast who keeps me captive.

31:14.973 --> 31:17.274
Moloch.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.047
Sir, I need a minute.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.315
Don't have one.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.817
But it's about crane
and the boy.

31:26.819 --> 31:28.652
If you can help me
get them out...

31:28.654 --> 31:30.320
They're not going
anywhere.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.689
We have most of
sleepy hollow in
an absolute panic

31:32.691 --> 31:34.057
Over this potential
epidemic.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.525
The doctors will handle
the patients.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.394
I need you
on the streets.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.230
We have to shut down
the traffic moving
in and out of town.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.565
There is no time
for that.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.900
My point exactly.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.801
Report to morales for your post.

32:10.361 --> 32:11.929
Really?

32:13.932 --> 32:16.867
Hmm, what the hell.

32:16.869 --> 32:20.203
Why would you be trapped
in such a place?

32:20.205 --> 32:22.806
What does moloch want
with your soul?

32:25.243 --> 32:27.744
Katrina...

32:27.746 --> 32:30.614
What is it
you're not telling me?

32:35.553 --> 32:38.655
If this is a trial...

32:40.725 --> 32:43.560
...I'm gonna need
a little evidence.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.062
Is that boy
really gonna be saved

32:45.064 --> 32:46.563
If I get him back to his home?

32:46.565 --> 32:47.898
What about the others?

32:47.900 --> 32:49.232
What about crane?

32:49.234 --> 32:51.401
Would he be saved at roanoke

32:51.403 --> 32:54.805
Because it's... Trapped
in time like him?

33:03.247 --> 33:06.984
Show... Me... A sign.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.387
Give me something.

33:12.924 --> 33:15.392
Isn't that the kind of thing
that you're known for?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.435
Yep. (chuckles)

33:25.437 --> 33:27.704
Didn't think so.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.958
Crane:
Something in the environment,

33:47.960 --> 33:50.394
The cure seems to lie
within the colony.

34:05.309 --> 34:07.677
What is it
you're afraid to say?

34:07.679 --> 34:11.481
I believe I know
why I am here.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.550
Why I cannot leave.

34:13.552 --> 34:17.054
Why? Tell me.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.488
Ichabod!

34:18.490 --> 34:21.224
You fight for your life!

34:21.226 --> 34:22.459
You fight for the both of us!

34:23.828 --> 34:25.729
(gasps)

34:28.566 --> 34:31.568
Abbie:
<i>I need to get them back</i>
<i>to the colony.</i>

34:31.570 --> 34:33.036
I think that
the springwater there

34:33.038 --> 34:35.205
Could be what heals them.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.507
Think about it.

34:37.509 --> 34:41.011
Water is used in many religions
as a way to purify.

34:41.013 --> 34:45.015
Roanoke seems
to be some sort of holy place.

34:45.017 --> 34:48.185
So you think they need to
baptized in it or something?

34:48.187 --> 34:49.853
I do.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.556
For now, we're just stalling
the inevitable.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.091
Thomas will die
if he isn't returned.

34:54.093 --> 34:55.459
And crane.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.930
Do you really believe
that's gonna work?

35:01.766 --> 35:05.368
I've got no choice
but to believe.

35:05.370 --> 35:09.239
Okay.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.875
I think I have a way.

35:11.877 --> 35:15.045
<i>Another quarantine facility</i>
<i>has been set up</i>

35:15.047 --> 35:16.546
<i>For projected overflow.</i>

35:16.548 --> 35:17.948
<i>Parsons will get orders</i>
<i>to transfer</i>

35:17.950 --> 35:19.616
<i>Thomas and crane there,</i>

35:19.618 --> 35:20.750
Creating an opportunity for you

35:20.752 --> 35:21.785
<i>To get them to this colony.</i>

35:21.787 --> 35:23.253
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

35:23.255 --> 35:25.122
<i>If the solution is there,</i>

35:25.124 --> 35:27.724
<i>I'll do what I can to get</i>
<i>the remaining infected</i>

35:27.726 --> 35:29.092
<i>To the location.</i>

35:29.094 --> 35:32.395
<i>But, abbie... Hurry.</i>

35:32.397 --> 35:35.532
Hey, what are you doing?!

35:41.405 --> 35:43.240
Abbie:
<i>Keep talking to me, crane.</i>

35:43.242 --> 35:46.443
Keep your mind off the pain.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.745
Katrina.
I saw katrina

35:48.747 --> 35:50.614
While I was
unconscious.

35:50.616 --> 35:54.117
And now I understand
why I haven't been
able to go there.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.452
Why?

35:55.454 --> 35:58.755
The place is...

35:58.757 --> 36:01.258
Is a purgatory

36:01.260 --> 36:04.261
For souls left hanging
in the balance,

36:04.263 --> 36:07.097
Caught between good and evil.

36:07.099 --> 36:11.434
It's like a no-man's-land
on a battlefield.

36:11.436 --> 36:14.437
I'm glad you fought
your way out of it.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.605
(grunts)

36:15.607 --> 36:17.107
Crane!

36:17.109 --> 36:18.675
I'm all right.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.243
I can't say the same for thomas.

36:21.445 --> 36:23.847
We're losing him.

36:37.328 --> 36:40.997
It's weak, but he's
still got a heartbeat.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.800
We've got to keep moving.
Almost there.

36:43.802 --> 36:48.038
I'm so sorry.
I feel a little faint.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.374
You go on to roanoke.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.310
Send the colonists back for us.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.145
I cannot make it
without you.

36:55.147 --> 36:57.547
Yes, you can.
All the trees look
the same to me.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.982
(chuckles)
hang on.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.984
I need
a little rest.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.352
Hang on.

37:02.354 --> 37:05.422
I think you just need
a little, a little boost.

37:07.191 --> 37:09.626
(gasps)

37:11.329 --> 37:13.163
What was that?

37:13.165 --> 37:14.497
Adrenaline.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.933
I like it.
(approaching hoofbeats)

37:18.569 --> 37:20.904
Let's go. Let's go.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.306
Let's keep moving.
(groans)

37:32.750 --> 37:34.784
Crane!

37:46.564 --> 37:47.964
Crane!

37:48.866 --> 37:50.267
Crane!

37:51.535 --> 37:52.902
Crane!

37:52.904 --> 37:54.804
Crane! Crane!

38:04.248 --> 38:06.082
You were right.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.151
The waters provide a cure.

38:15.726 --> 38:18.295
(wind whistling)

38:19.397 --> 38:20.664
(gasps)

38:22.300 --> 38:23.967
(gasps)

38:26.404 --> 38:28.972
What just happened?

38:30.775 --> 38:32.876
Thomas...

38:35.479 --> 38:38.248
He was dead all along.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.317
They all were.

38:44.588 --> 38:47.090
But everyone else

38:47.092 --> 38:49.592
In sleepy hollow,
they saw him.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.261
They were affected by him.

38:51.263 --> 38:54.664
He returned
to flesh and blood...

38:54.666 --> 38:58.268
<i>Once he was lured into our</i>
<i>world to spread a plague.</i>

38:58.270 --> 39:00.437
But we stopped it.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.805
Somehow.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.473
You stopped it

39:03.475 --> 39:05.608
By having faith.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.611
Your faith in being one
of the witnesses allowed you

39:08.613 --> 39:11.848
To see what your eyes could not.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.351
(phone rings)

39:18.122 --> 39:19.789
Captain?

39:19.791 --> 39:20.957
You're not gonna believe this.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.292
Try me.

39:22.294 --> 39:26.196
We don't know how,
but everyone's recovering.

39:26.198 --> 39:27.964
I'm glad to hear it, sir.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.367
Thank you.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.204
It worked.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.206
Everyone in town's
gonna be fine.

39:39.510 --> 39:44.981
Hey, I know everything
has been so new for you,

39:44.983 --> 39:46.483
So different.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.651
It's been hard
to adjust.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.320
Actually, for a minute there,

39:50.322 --> 39:52.889
I thought you might choose
to stay in the colony.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.995
But, crane...

39:58.997 --> 40:01.331
Believe me...

40:01.333 --> 40:04.601
When I say that you belong
in sleepy hollow.

40:06.504 --> 40:09.139
In the here and now.

40:14.712 --> 40:17.013
Well...

40:17.015 --> 40:19.315
What do you say we go home then?

40:22.520 --> 40:24.754
We have much more work to do.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.723
Though we have prevented
one horseman's arrival today,

40:26.725 --> 40:28.591
<i>We will require much more</i>
<i>than faith</i>

40:28.593 --> 40:31.361
<i>If and when</i>
<i>the horseman of death returns.</i>

40:31.363 --> 40:33.830
(neighs)

40:36.367 --> 40:37.867
(whinnies)

40:37.869 --> 40:40.303
(thunder crashes)
