WEBVTT

00:02.687 --> 00:06.396
Captain's log, stardate 46682.4.

00:06.487 --> 00:09.160
The Enterprise is docked
at the Remmler Array,

00:09.247 --> 00:13.365
where it will undergo a procedure
to eliminate baryon particles.

00:13.447 --> 00:17.281
In preparation for the sweep,
we are evacuating the ship.

00:18.327 --> 00:21.160
Attention,
personnel on decks 14 and 15.

00:21.247 --> 00:25.035
Your transporter-room assignment
has been changed.

00:25.127 --> 00:29.245
Captain, we're still behind
schedule on decks seven and eight.

00:29.327 --> 00:31.841
Shall I tell our base
there'll be a delay?

00:31.927 --> 00:34.566
No. Open up the transporters
on cargo bay two.

00:34.647 --> 00:38.117
Divert everyone from deck seven
to put it on track.

00:38.207 --> 00:41.802
All Engineering personnel
are requested to report to...

00:41.887 --> 00:43.684
Captain!

00:43.767 --> 00:46.759
The Arkaria Base does not have
the units I requested.

00:46.847 --> 00:50.886
I have living tissue samples
that won't survive the baryon sweep.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.685
I've tried to reason with them.

00:52.767 --> 00:56.521
Have La Forge transport
a stasis unit from astrophysics.

00:56.607 --> 00:58.802
You can convert it to store samples.

00:58.887 --> 01:00.400
Thank you, Captain.

01:00.487 --> 01:02.443
All science personnel.

01:02.527 --> 01:06.566
Please check in with your
section chief for duty assignment.

01:06.647 --> 01:08.285
I'm heading to deck seven.

01:08.367 --> 01:11.837
The auto-shutdown is on hold
until we're back on schedule.

01:11.927 --> 01:16.045
Resume the sequence.
Troi has taken care of the situation.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.762
- Captain.
- Bridge.

01:25.847 --> 01:29.635
It has been quite a day. Has it not?

01:32.087 --> 01:33.486
Yes, it has.

01:35.567 --> 01:38.479
However, a change of routine
is often invigorating

01:38.567 --> 01:41.400
and a welcome diversion
after a long assignment.

01:41.487 --> 01:42.602
Exactly.

01:45.527 --> 01:50.396
I understand that Arkaria has
very interesting weather patterns.

01:51.407 --> 01:54.683
- Mr. Data, are you alright?
- Yes, sir.

01:54.767 --> 01:58.601
I am filling a silent moment
with non-relevant conversation.

02:01.007 --> 02:03.965
- Small talk.
- Yes, sir.

02:04.047 --> 02:08.039
I find that humans often use
small talk during awkward moments.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.961
Therefore, I have written
a new subroutine for that purpose.

02:12.047 --> 02:13.400
How did I do?

02:15.487 --> 02:18.763
Perhaps it was
a little too non-relevant.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.442
But if you really are
interested in small talk,

02:22.527 --> 02:27.203
keep your eye on Cmdr Hutchinson
at the reception this afternoon.

02:28.087 --> 02:29.918
He's a master.

02:31.607 --> 02:33.325
Thank you, sir. I will.

02:36.847 --> 02:38.246
- Captain.
- Captain.

02:41.007 --> 02:42.918
- After you.
- No, after you.

02:43.007 --> 02:47.000
- I believe you spoke first.
- Gentlemen! Mr. Worf?

02:47.087 --> 02:51.319
The computer needs your authorization
to disable command functions.

02:51.407 --> 02:53.079
- Are we ready?
- Almost.

02:53.167 --> 02:56.716
I requested two field diverters
for the core and the bridge.

02:56.807 --> 02:59.685
- They haven't been installed.
- Additional units?

02:59.767 --> 03:00.995
Yes, sir.

03:01.087 --> 03:06.115
We've logged so many warp hours
that our baryon levels are high.

03:06.207 --> 03:09.597
I'm concerned that when
the Remmler Array sweeps the ship,

03:09.687 --> 03:12.838
it will have to use a stronger beam
than normal.

03:12.927 --> 03:16.397
It might overload the field
converters protecting our systems.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.796
How long till new ones are in place?

03:18.887 --> 03:22.197
- About 20 minutes.
- Very well.

03:22.287 --> 03:25.643
Computer, disable
all command functions in 30 minutes.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.400
Authorization, Picard, Gamma 6073.

03:28.487 --> 03:30.921
Authorization acknowledged.

03:31.007 --> 03:33.885
Captain, incoming message.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.800
It's the station administrator,
Mr. Orton.

03:36.887 --> 03:39.162
- In my ready room.
- Captain.

03:39.247 --> 03:43.559
Request permission to be excused
from Cmdr Hutchinson's reception.

03:44.287 --> 03:48.246
Permission granted. I wish I could
excuse myself as well.

03:48.327 --> 03:49.726
Permission to...

03:49.807 --> 03:53.595
Mr. La Forge, I cannot excuse
my entire senior staff!

03:53.687 --> 03:56.042
Mr. Worf beat you to it.

04:04.727 --> 04:06.001
Go ahead.

04:06.087 --> 04:08.840
If you're on schedule,
I'd like to confirm

04:08.927 --> 04:13.523
that we'll begin the baryon sweep
at 1500 hours, one hour from now.

04:13.607 --> 04:14.596
Confirmed.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.440
Cmdr Hutchinson also
wanted me to make sure

04:17.527 --> 04:21.440
that you will
attend his reception this afternoon.

04:23.327 --> 04:26.444
Tell him...
I'm looking forward to it.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.483
He'll be delighted to hear that.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.159
Arkaria Base out.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:26.487 --> 05:28.443
Tell Arkaria we're almost finished.

05:28.527 --> 05:30.518
We need two more conduits.

05:30.607 --> 05:34.839
- I need to run a diagnostic.
- Get the diverter aligned.

05:34.927 --> 05:36.724
Where's the ODN interface?

06:03.607 --> 06:06.679
Space, the final frontier.

06:08.207 --> 06:12.200
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

06:12.287 --> 06:16.439
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

06:17.447 --> 06:20.678
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

06:21.687 --> 06:25.566
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

07:36.447 --> 07:37.516
Beverly.

07:37.607 --> 07:40.679
Lovely as ever!
How do you manage it?

07:40.767 --> 07:44.043
- Good to see you again.
- It's been too long. Four years!

07:44.127 --> 07:48.279
Now, I want to hear about
everything after Starfleet Medical.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.642
And I have so much to tell you!

07:50.727 --> 07:54.242
That must be Cmdr Riker!

07:54.327 --> 07:56.682
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.678
Pardon me.

08:01.327 --> 08:04.205
- You must be Will Riker.
- I must be.

08:04.287 --> 08:06.596
Calvin Hutchinson. Call me Hutch.

08:07.527 --> 08:10.644
Calvin, awful name.
I've never forgiven my parents.

08:11.247 --> 08:15.240
Soon as I saw you,
I knew you were the First Officer.

08:15.327 --> 08:18.125
Of course.
Your reputation precedes you!

08:18.207 --> 08:20.596
Flashing blue eyes, square jaw.

08:20.687 --> 08:23.963
Quite the ladies' man.
Don't be modest, Will.

08:24.047 --> 08:26.607
- May I call you Will?
- Sure.

08:26.687 --> 08:30.441
I also hear that you're a musician.
I hope you'll play something.

08:30.527 --> 08:34.725
It's not often we entertain
the Command crew of the flagship.

08:35.327 --> 08:37.557
And speaking of command!

08:39.807 --> 08:42.719
- Hello, Capt Picard.
- Commander.

08:42.807 --> 08:47.005
I was just saying what a pleasure
it is to have you here.

08:47.087 --> 08:50.079
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

08:51.087 --> 08:54.079
It is very good
to see you both again!

08:54.167 --> 08:56.761
Beverly! May I call you Beverly?

08:58.047 --> 09:01.323
Have you noticed that the mean
temperature here on Arkaria

09:01.407 --> 09:05.480
is slightly higher than normal
for human comfort-levels?

09:05.567 --> 09:09.116
I have found that humans prefer
a body temperature of 21C

09:09.207 --> 09:12.005
in order to operate most efficiently.

09:12.087 --> 09:14.396
However, there are several cultures

09:14.487 --> 09:17.240
who actually prefer
that their temperature

09:17.327 --> 09:20.603
is identical to the room
in which they are standing.

09:20.687 --> 09:22.040
The Sheliak.

09:22.127 --> 09:25.278
I am telling you, you have
never seen anything like this.

09:25.367 --> 09:29.360
There were thousands of them.
The northern sky turned dark.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.119
Geordi, Deanna.

09:32.207 --> 09:34.402
I don't think you have met our host.

09:34.487 --> 09:38.241
This is Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge.
Counsellor Deanna Troi.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.966
- This is Cmdr Hutchinson.
- Call me Hutch.

09:41.047 --> 09:45.006
I was just telling your captain
about the sights on Arkaria.

09:45.087 --> 09:47.237
Are you interested in ornithology?

09:47.647 --> 09:48.875
Well...

09:48.967 --> 09:53.245
The mating habits of the Arkarian
horn fowl are interesting.

09:53.327 --> 09:57.206
If the weather were better,
we could take horses to their nests.

09:57.287 --> 09:59.198
- Horses?
- Yes.

09:59.287 --> 10:01.403
We have trails through the plains.

10:01.487 --> 10:04.718
Unfortunately,
it's not pleasant now. Cold, muddy.

10:04.807 --> 10:08.004
- Not a soul for kilometers.
- Perfect.

10:08.087 --> 10:10.760
Mr. La Forge,
how long before the baryon sweep?

10:10.847 --> 10:12.246
About 25 minutes.

10:12.727 --> 10:16.481
- I have time to get my saddle.
- Your saddle?

10:16.567 --> 10:20.446
Yes.
A saddle is a very personal thing.

10:20.527 --> 10:24.440
It has to be broken in,
used, cared for.

10:24.527 --> 10:27.280
You keep a saddle
on board the Enterprise?

10:27.367 --> 10:30.564
Yes, for when I have
the opportunity to ride.

10:30.647 --> 10:32.399
- I see.
- It's normal.

10:32.487 --> 10:35.957
Most serious riders
do have their own saddles.

10:36.047 --> 10:37.799
- Of course.
- Absolutely!

10:37.887 --> 10:39.718
Well, if you will excuse me...

10:42.647 --> 10:44.205
Amazing man.

10:44.287 --> 10:47.120
He reminds me
of another officer I knew years ago.

10:47.207 --> 10:50.040
A Capt Edwell. He was fascinating.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.595
Born on Gaspar VII,
but you wouldn't know it.

10:58.447 --> 11:02.599
Auto-shutdown in progress.
Defensive systems off line.

11:02.687 --> 11:05.918
Baryon sweep begins
in eight minutes.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.805
What are you doing?

11:24.687 --> 11:28.123
Someone left
this ODN junction box open.

11:28.207 --> 11:31.517
I thought you were supposed
to be off the ship.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.476
The diverters
have to be synchronized.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.556
I was laser-bonding a backup.

11:38.247 --> 11:43.446
I see. I'd better let you finish up
so that you can get off.

11:46.487 --> 11:48.159
Excuse me a minute.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.355
Auto-shutdown sequence
in progress.

12:04.447 --> 12:07.280
Primary power off line
in one minute.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.955
- We need to bypass the conduit.
- That's on deck 30.

12:17.047 --> 12:20.119
Get Pomet started on it right away.

12:24.567 --> 12:28.082
Primary power off line
in 30 seconds.

12:35.807 --> 12:40.358
Final warning. Primary power
off line in ten seconds.

13:14.207 --> 13:16.482
Yes. I find it fascinating

13:16.567 --> 13:20.355
that your family dropped
the prefix Pel from your surname.

13:20.447 --> 13:23.166
It was my understanding
that Pel Orton

13:23.247 --> 13:26.205
is a more noble appellation
than Orton.

13:26.287 --> 13:27.686
Yes.

13:27.767 --> 13:33.285
Perhaps the recent trend toward an
egalitarian society is responsible.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.041
Perhaps.

13:36.127 --> 13:39.836
The crew of the Magellan
put on a talent show here.

13:39.927 --> 13:43.522
Capt Conklin did a poetry reading.
Imagine that.

13:43.607 --> 13:47.282
- I'm trying to.
- Did I tell you how I came here?

13:47.367 --> 13:51.042
I was serving on Admiral Mitchell's
staff on Star base 97.

13:51.127 --> 13:55.245
- Awful place.
- Have you met our Cmdr Data?

13:55.327 --> 13:58.603
As a matter of fact,
I find it oddly amusing!

13:58.687 --> 14:02.965
- No, I don't think so.
- Come on. I'll introduce you.

14:03.047 --> 14:07.165
Several cultures have extremely
similar etymological histories.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.717
Mr. Data, have you had a chance
to meet Cmdr Hutchinson?

14:10.807 --> 14:13.799
- Call me Hutch.
- Our second officer.

14:13.927 --> 14:16.919
- A pleasure.
- The pleasure is mine, Hutch.

14:17.007 --> 14:19.999
I want to compliment you
on your choice of colours.

14:20.087 --> 14:21.759
You really think so?

14:21.847 --> 14:24.566
It wasn't easy,
making a final decision.

14:24.647 --> 14:29.084
I can imagine. The light would
make colour selection problematic.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.600
Precisely!

14:32.887 --> 14:34.525
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:34.607 --> 14:38.122
- I'm not sure who to feel sorry for.
- Mr. Orton?

14:38.207 --> 14:40.357
You'll excuse me, Commander?

14:41.447 --> 14:46.157
- Geordi, where's the Captain?
- He went back to get his saddle.

14:46.247 --> 14:47.566
His saddle?

14:47.647 --> 14:50.719
Any serious rider
would have his own saddle.

14:51.327 --> 14:54.478
He's probably ten kilometers
from here already.

14:54.567 --> 14:56.285
Lucky him!

14:57.607 --> 14:59.086
Thank you.

15:35.407 --> 15:37.125
Kelsey to Devor.

15:38.087 --> 15:40.237
Kelsey to Devor

15:40.327 --> 15:42.238
Devor, this is Kelsey. Reply.

15:42.327 --> 15:44.204
Devor, do you read me?

15:45.127 --> 15:48.005
- Kelsey to Kiros.
- This is Kiros.

15:48.087 --> 15:52.285
Devor isn't responding
There must be too much interference.

15:52.367 --> 15:55.439
Go find him.
See if he's finished on deck seven.

15:55.527 --> 15:58.564
- Meet us in Main Engineering.
- Understood.

16:07.327 --> 16:10.524
Who are you?
What are you doing on my ship?

16:12.607 --> 16:16.441
The baryon sweep uses
a high-frequency plasma field.

16:16.527 --> 16:18.324
Your phaser won't work.

16:18.407 --> 16:22.685
You're probably right.
But I'd like to bet this will.

16:23.447 --> 16:25.836
A laser welder can be deadly.

16:25.927 --> 16:29.283
Now, what's going on
in Main Engineering?

16:30.967 --> 16:33.322
I suggest that you cooperate.

16:33.967 --> 16:37.164
You're Starfleet. You won't kill me.

16:37.927 --> 16:39.758
You sure?

16:51.047 --> 16:53.117
Seems you're right.

17:27.087 --> 17:31.239
Tyrellian laser art is very similar
in form and composition.

17:31.327 --> 17:34.922
Of course!
I used to be stationed on Tyrellia.

17:35.007 --> 17:39.205
Really? There are five Tyrellians
serving aboard the Enterprise.

17:39.287 --> 17:41.642
Fascinating.
Not many people know this.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.083
Tyrellia is only one
of three known inhabited planets

17:45.167 --> 17:47.965
- without a magnetic pole.
- I was aware of that.

17:48.047 --> 17:49.765
Are you aware that Tyrellia

17:49.847 --> 17:52.759
is one of seven known planets
with no atmosphere?

17:52.847 --> 17:54.166
Really?

17:54.247 --> 17:56.761
- They're still at it!
- Non-stop.

17:56.847 --> 17:58.758
It has a strange fascination.

17:58.847 --> 18:02.283
How long can two people
talk about nothing?

18:15.287 --> 18:16.800
Is something wrong?

18:17.807 --> 18:22.005
I don't know. I got strange
energy readings from your table.

18:22.087 --> 18:23.839
I'm sure it's not serious.

18:23.927 --> 18:26.521
Perhaps the heating
is malfunctioning.

18:26.607 --> 18:28.120
Maybe I should look.

18:28.207 --> 18:31.165
I'm sure we can handle this,
Commander.

18:31.247 --> 18:33.886
There's no need to concern yourself.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.003
Maybe I should look
at the element.

18:36.087 --> 18:38.317
It's alright. Please, don't worry.

18:39.287 --> 18:41.437
What was that all about?

18:41.527 --> 18:44.564
I assure you it's alright.
We'll look into it.

18:44.647 --> 18:46.797
You don't have to concern yourself.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.558
Orton, now!

18:58.087 --> 18:59.839
What is going on?

19:02.367 --> 19:04.756
Stay right where you are.

19:25.007 --> 19:29.159
Reduce the plasma pressure
to 0.6 percent nominal.

19:29.887 --> 19:31.559
0.6.

19:31.647 --> 19:35.640
- How does the conduit look?
- It's clear.

19:35.727 --> 19:40.323
Alright. The plasma flow has
been shunted to the aft conduit.

19:40.407 --> 19:41.965
We're ready here.

19:45.087 --> 19:47.362
OK, that should do it, I think.

19:49.287 --> 19:50.925
Be sure, Neil.

19:51.967 --> 19:54.401
Yes. Yeah, that does it.

19:55.127 --> 20:00.884
Alright! Transfer 500 milligrams
from the reserve system to the core.

20:07.087 --> 20:09.840
- Perfect!
- Adequate.

20:09.927 --> 20:14.125
Disable the overrides. Get
the interlocks off the seal. Pomet!

20:14.687 --> 20:17.042
Prepare the transport assembly.

20:17.127 --> 20:20.005
Keep watching that power flow.
It might...

20:29.087 --> 20:30.440
Keep working!

20:34.007 --> 20:36.805
- Where did he come from?
- Deck seven.

20:38.127 --> 20:41.199
- Who are you?
- My name is Mot.

20:41.287 --> 20:44.199
- I'm the barber.
- Barber?

20:44.287 --> 20:48.724
What are you doing here? Everyone
was evacuated to the surface.

20:48.807 --> 20:50.684
Yes, I know.

20:50.767 --> 20:54.203
But I wanted to ride.
I didn't have my saddle...

20:54.287 --> 20:56.847
- Your saddle?
- That's right.

20:57.487 --> 21:02.277
It's on deck seven.
The power went out and I got lost...

21:02.367 --> 21:04.835
Alright! Shut up. Just shut up!

21:06.647 --> 21:08.524
- Any sign of Devor?
- No.

21:10.407 --> 21:16.277
Satler. Get down here
and keep an eye on our barber.

21:18.287 --> 21:21.996
Go see if you can find Devor.
Make sure nothing's wrong.

21:25.127 --> 21:26.560
Sit down.

21:28.447 --> 21:31.359
Alright.
Just don't point that thing at me.

21:31.447 --> 21:34.883
Do what I tell you.
You won't have to worry.

21:47.927 --> 21:51.203
- How long until you're ready?
- 40, maybe 50 minutes.

21:51.287 --> 21:53.721
The baryon sweep hits
in 30 minutes.

21:53.807 --> 21:58.323
- The diverter will protect us.
- I'm worried about that unit.

21:58.407 --> 22:02.036
I want the trilithium resin
in there before the sweep gets here.

22:02.127 --> 22:05.676
- I don't want to take chances.
- Understood.

22:30.487 --> 22:33.877
They haven't tried
to communicate with the outside.

22:33.967 --> 22:37.277
No demands,
no political statements, no theft.

22:37.367 --> 22:39.756
They must want something.

22:39.847 --> 22:44.284
Orton is not as calm as he looks.
He's agitated and nervous.

22:44.367 --> 22:46.323
As if something's gone wrong.

22:46.407 --> 22:50.685
Maybe Geordi upset their timetable
when he saw the hidden weapons.

22:50.767 --> 22:52.485
Orton may be improvising.

22:52.567 --> 22:56.560
Maybe he didn't plan on hostages
and doesn't know what to do.

22:56.647 --> 23:00.799
If they do not have a plan,
we may have the initiative.

23:00.887 --> 23:04.596
Maybe, but we need to figure out
how to use it.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.279
How is he?

23:06.847 --> 23:09.236
There's no permanent damage.

23:09.327 --> 23:12.717
I've adjusted
the optical transducer in his visor

23:12.807 --> 23:16.959
to block out some of the pain.
It's only partially effective.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.720
I need to get him
to a medical facility.

23:19.807 --> 23:22.196
I doubt if they'll agree to that.

23:22.287 --> 23:26.280
But maybe if we tell them
Geordi's dying,

23:26.367 --> 23:29.359
they would give us
access to a medical kit.

23:30.247 --> 23:33.398
We might be able to use the tools
to make a weapon.

23:33.487 --> 23:36.047
Perhaps we can use the visor
as a weapon.

23:36.127 --> 23:38.641
If the optical transducer
were modified,

23:38.727 --> 23:41.639
we might be able to generate
a hypersonic pulse.

23:41.727 --> 23:45.686
A hypersonic pulse would overload
the audio receptors of everyone.

23:45.767 --> 23:48.759
It would cause
immediate unconsciousness.

23:51.727 --> 23:54.366
Can you adjust the visor yourself?

23:54.447 --> 23:57.166
It will look suspicious
if you both work on it.

23:57.247 --> 24:01.957
I'll try. I might need Geordi
to help me through.

24:02.047 --> 24:04.959
Alright. Be as casual as you can.

24:05.087 --> 24:07.078
Let me know when you're ready.

24:25.007 --> 24:26.076
Ready.

24:26.167 --> 24:30.604
Begin draining the trilithium
at 100 milligrams per minute.

25:09.447 --> 25:11.199
Neil, what's going on?

25:11.287 --> 25:13.562
Neil, get over here. Put that down.

25:13.647 --> 25:16.719
Don't worry.
I've got it. I'll be right there.

26:53.967 --> 26:58.643
The primary inducer is fused.
There's no way to fix it.

26:58.727 --> 27:02.402
With no diverter, we have
no protection from the baryon sweep.

27:02.487 --> 27:06.196
I know that. How long before
the baryon sweep gets here?

27:06.287 --> 27:09.802
About 12 minutes.
We should go to ten-forward.

27:09.887 --> 27:14.005
That's the last place that
will be swept by the baryon field.

27:14.087 --> 27:18.842
Alright, we're leaving.
We're taking the trilithium with us.

27:19.727 --> 27:23.402
What? Do you know
how volatile trilithium is?

27:23.487 --> 27:26.718
We can't just start hauling it
through the ship!

27:27.407 --> 27:28.886
I'll...

27:28.967 --> 27:32.039
I'll try to make some modifications.

27:41.407 --> 27:44.365
Satler's dead.
He ran into the baryon sweep.

27:44.447 --> 27:46.597
- What about Mot?
- I don't know.

27:46.687 --> 27:51.602
I don't think he's a barber.
I found this in the Jefferies tube.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.483
Kelsey to Kiros.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.125
This is Kiros.

28:24.207 --> 28:26.004
We have a problem.

28:26.087 --> 28:28.476
There's a Starfleet officer
still aboard.

28:28.567 --> 28:30.842
He's killed Satler and maybe Devor.

28:30.927 --> 28:33.600
He destroyed the diverter
in Engineering.

28:33.687 --> 28:36.485
We have to leave
before the baryon sweep enters.

28:36.567 --> 28:41.277
- What about the trilithium resin?
- We're taking it to ten-forward.

28:41.367 --> 28:42.959
Kelsey, don't be a fool.

28:43.047 --> 28:46.517
You know better
than to move trilithium resin.

28:46.607 --> 28:49.519
Mr. Mot!
Or should I call you Lieutenant?

28:49.607 --> 28:51.677
Lieutenant Commander, perhaps?

28:51.767 --> 28:53.280
Call me what you wish.

28:53.367 --> 28:56.245
Moving trilithium
requires specific equipment.

28:56.327 --> 28:57.919
You can't just improvise.

28:58.007 --> 29:01.761
I wouldn't need to improvise
if you hadn't damaged our diverter.

29:01.847 --> 29:06.125
If you're so concerned, I suggest
you stop interfering with us,

29:06.207 --> 29:10.723
before you set off an explosion that
destroys the Enterprise. And you.

29:11.127 --> 29:15.643
I would rather destroy the ship
than give the resin to terrorists.

29:15.727 --> 29:18.002
What makes you think
I am a terrorist?

29:18.327 --> 29:22.843
Trilithium resin is a toxic waste-
product produced by our engines.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.441
Its only use is as a weapon.

29:27.847 --> 29:33.558
You might be right, but we have been
planning for this for a long time.

29:33.647 --> 29:37.526
I doubt you'll be able to stop us.
Find him!

29:37.607 --> 29:39.199
Or even slow us down.

29:47.527 --> 29:51.440
There. 300 milligrams of trilithium.

29:52.247 --> 29:56.684
I'm using a dynamic stabilizer
to act as a control rod.

29:58.007 --> 30:01.477
That should keep the resin
stable enough for transport.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.127
Come on! Don't be so tense.

30:04.207 --> 30:08.405
If something goes wrong, you won't
have time to worry about it.

30:24.047 --> 30:29.838
Three more decks, then we take
corridor 15B to ten-forward.

30:35.727 --> 30:39.481
- What's wrong?
- We have to find another way up.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.439
The rungs are cut.

30:47.567 --> 30:50.365
That wasn't very clever, Mr. Mot.

30:50.447 --> 30:53.644
If you knew where we were,
you should have attacked.

30:53.727 --> 30:57.720
Now we'll take a route,
one you might not be able to predict.

30:57.807 --> 31:00.844
There are only so many ways
to ten-forward.

31:00.927 --> 31:04.556
Ten-forward is the logical place
to stay ahead of the sweep.

31:04.647 --> 31:08.003
That sweep is just as big a threat
to you as it is to us.

31:08.087 --> 31:11.045
In fact, if I were you, Mr. Mot,

31:11.127 --> 31:14.597
I'd be trying
to find another way off this ship.

31:16.687 --> 31:20.566
I plan on leaving
the same way you do. On your ship.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.515
- What ship?
- Come on, Kelsey.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.804
You've been planning this.

31:25.887 --> 31:29.960
You must have a way to get off
the Enterprise and leave this system.

31:30.047 --> 31:34.245
I think a ship is coming for you.
I plan to be on it.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.283
It's a small ship, Mr. Mot.

31:36.367 --> 31:39.325
I don't think there's room
for both of us.

31:39.407 --> 31:43.161
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll send your regrets.

32:04.407 --> 32:05.920
How is he, Doctor?

32:07.647 --> 32:11.322
He's in a lot of pain
but I think he should be fine.

32:12.367 --> 32:14.801
He needs some water.
Is that alright?

32:27.647 --> 32:29.638
We're almost ready.

32:29.727 --> 32:33.879
When we set the visor to emit the
pulse, there'll be a burst of light.

32:33.967 --> 32:35.605
We need a distraction.

32:49.887 --> 32:52.879
- They need a distraction.
- How long?

32:52.967 --> 32:55.037
Just a few seconds.

32:55.127 --> 32:58.039
I think I can distract Orton
for a few seconds.

32:58.127 --> 33:01.676
I don't think Orton's
in a talking mood, Will.

33:01.767 --> 33:04.725
You just have to know
how to talk to him.

33:11.247 --> 33:14.523
Orton. I think we need
to discuss the situation.

33:14.607 --> 33:17.679
There is nothing to discuss.
Sit down.

33:17.767 --> 33:20.406
There's a lot to discuss.
Be reasonable.

33:20.487 --> 33:25.117
I am not interested in hearing
your hostage-negotiation tactics.

33:25.207 --> 33:28.199
It can't hurt you to listen, can it?

33:29.607 --> 33:32.041
- Alright.
- Thank you.

33:32.127 --> 33:35.881
Now, the first thing
we need to discuss is this...

34:36.367 --> 34:37.846
Hold it.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.764
Put your weapon down.

34:52.847 --> 34:57.204
Kelsey, this is Kiros.
I'm on deck ten. I have Mot.

34:57.287 --> 34:59.198
- Is he alive?
- Yes.

34:59.287 --> 35:02.597
Good. Meet us at intersection 41 .

35:02.687 --> 35:03.961
Understood.

35:06.207 --> 35:07.799
This way.

35:29.887 --> 35:32.037
Give me the trilithium.

35:34.127 --> 35:36.197
How much farther do we have to go?

35:36.287 --> 35:40.246
Not far. With all the modifications
you've made to this unit,

35:40.327 --> 35:43.160
will we have problems
removing the trilithium?

35:43.247 --> 35:48.162
No. Just remove the control rod,
drain the unit.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.477
There shouldn't be any problem.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.526
That's all I wanted to know.

36:00.247 --> 36:03.125
Well! Not as clever as you thought.

36:03.207 --> 36:06.916
- Where's Pomet?
- He shot him with an arrow.

36:07.007 --> 36:09.157
- He's not dead.
- He will be soon.

36:09.247 --> 36:12.125
The sweep's nearly here.
No time to go back.

36:12.207 --> 36:16.166
- What about Neil?
- The sweep got him. Let's go.

36:26.927 --> 36:29.077
I thought you'd just talk to him.

36:29.167 --> 36:32.045
I did. He just didn't like
what I had to say.

36:45.127 --> 36:48.244
That was a perimeter warning
from the Remmler Array.

36:48.327 --> 36:52.115
A small ship is approaching.
Mr. Orton has dropped his shields.

36:52.207 --> 36:53.799
This must be the sign.

36:53.887 --> 36:57.926
Mr. Data, you will be the only one
unaffected by the burst.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.396
As soon as everyone else
is unconscious,

37:00.487 --> 37:05.038
I need you to get to that computer
and stop that ship somehow.

37:05.127 --> 37:06.685
I will try, sir.

37:09.567 --> 37:10.682
Now.

37:28.847 --> 37:31.361
Kelsey,
perhaps we can work out a deal.

37:31.447 --> 37:33.961
You're the one who needs a deal, Mot.

37:34.047 --> 37:37.084
My name isn't Mot.
It's Jean-Luc Picard.

37:38.407 --> 37:42.480
Capt Picard,
this is all beginning to make sense.

37:42.567 --> 37:46.401
Leave the trilithium.
Take me with you as a hostage.

37:46.487 --> 37:49.797
I am not a terrorist,
I have no political agenda,

37:49.887 --> 37:52.720
although I know some people
who do have agendas.

37:52.807 --> 37:56.766
And they are very interested
in this little container.

37:56.847 --> 38:00.442
Profit. This is all about profit.

38:00.527 --> 38:03.360
I prefer to think of it
as commerce.

38:13.207 --> 38:14.720
Open the door.

38:29.927 --> 38:32.157
Now, go through slowly.

39:29.367 --> 39:34.441
Well, Picard, I guess I'll be the one
to send your regrets.

39:42.407 --> 39:45.843
Picard to Arkaria Base.
Deactivate the baryon sweep.

39:51.927 --> 39:55.556
Arkaria Base. This is Capt Picard
on board the Enterprise.

39:55.647 --> 39:58.081
Deactivate the baryon sweep!

40:00.847 --> 40:03.077
Arkaria Base. This is Capt Picard.

40:03.167 --> 40:06.239
Deactivate
the baryon sweep immediately!

40:23.407 --> 40:26.683
Data to Capt Picard.
Do you read me, sir?

40:27.887 --> 40:31.004
- Picard here.
- Are you alright, Captain?

40:31.727 --> 40:33.524
Yes, Mr. Data.

40:33.607 --> 40:36.758
A scout ship has just beamed
someone off the Enterprise.

40:36.847 --> 40:38.883
Do you know anything about it?

40:42.967 --> 40:44.958
I know they won't get far.

41:15.567 --> 41:18.559
Hold still.
You have a nasty cut here.

41:19.847 --> 41:21.166
Any luck?

41:21.247 --> 41:24.603
Sorry, Captain.
I don't know what happened to it.

41:24.687 --> 41:28.475
Hold still! I can't heal this
if you don't stop fidgeting.

41:28.567 --> 41:31.843
Security has searched deck seven.
They found nothing.

41:31.927 --> 41:32.916
There.

41:37.607 --> 41:39.518
I found it.

41:41.367 --> 41:43.881
Someone put it
in a maintenance locker.

41:44.727 --> 41:48.845
- Thank you.
- You keep a saddle on board?

41:48.927 --> 41:50.485
Mr. Worf, I'm surprised.

41:51.167 --> 41:54.842
Anyone who is an experienced rider
has his own saddle.

41:54.927 --> 41:59.284
- It's perfectly normal.
- Actually, it came in handy.

41:59.367 --> 42:02.518
I only wish I'd been able
to use it on a horse.

42:03.207 --> 42:04.640
Of course.

43:04.727 --> 43:05.716
(ENGLISH)

43:06.305 --> 43:12.560
