WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:03.701
(speaking quietly)

00:06.771 --> 00:09.305
(whispering): Coach and May are fighting.
We don't want to disturb them.

00:09.307 --> 00:10.606
They're not fighting.

00:10.608 --> 00:12.341
I know how to read
body language. Look.

00:12.343 --> 00:13.942
Her arms are crossed
in a position of dominance,

00:13.944 --> 00:15.543
and he's playing his forehead
like a piano.

00:15.545 --> 00:17.211
WINSTON:
Will you clowns focus?

00:17.213 --> 00:19.947
My waffle is in the toaster,
and if I wait too long

00:19.949 --> 00:21.848
after it pops, it'll get hard.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.182
Look, I know
about relationships.

00:23.184 --> 00:24.449
Winston can
vouch for me.

00:24.451 --> 00:26.350
That girl, KC,
just texted him,

00:26.352 --> 00:28.185
"What's up?"

00:28.187 --> 00:29.486
That riddler. So I
had him text back

00:29.488 --> 00:31.287
an empty bubble.

00:31.289 --> 00:34.156
Is he thinking about her? Or is
a baby playing with the phone?

00:34.158 --> 00:36.491
She don't know,
but she want to know.

00:36.493 --> 00:38.025
There she is. There she is.
Oh.

00:38.027 --> 00:38.992
JESS:
Hey.

00:38.994 --> 00:40.860
Morning. Hello. How do?

00:40.862 --> 00:42.862
Hey. Oh, someone left a waffle
in the toaster.

00:42.864 --> 00:43.996
Bye, guys.

00:43.998 --> 00:45.230
Man, this waffle
better be hot

00:45.232 --> 00:47.232
or I am going
Durst on y'all!

00:47.234 --> 00:49.000
Hey... Coach.

00:49.002 --> 00:51.502
Why... Jess,
are you talking like that?

00:51.504 --> 00:52.636
She thinks you and
May are fighting.

00:52.638 --> 00:53.870
No, we're not fighting.

00:53.872 --> 00:55.071
(chuckles)

00:55.073 --> 00:56.238
We did break up though.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.639
(gasps)
Oh, my God, I knew it.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.040
I mean, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

00:59.042 --> 01:00.341
May accepted a
job in New York

01:00.343 --> 01:03.577
as a section musician
for the Met.

01:03.579 --> 01:05.312
Oh, has Alan taken a liking
to her? Oh, bravo.

01:05.314 --> 01:07.147
Good for... You know,
I've always been a fan of his.

01:07.149 --> 01:10.550
When he conducted, uh,
<i> Das Rheingold</i>

01:10.552 --> 01:13.586
with the Royal Stockholm
Orchestra, it was magnificent.

01:13.588 --> 01:14.987
Jar or slap?

01:14.989 --> 01:17.255
I don't have
any cash on me.

01:17.257 --> 01:18.489
Good slap.
JESS: Are you okay?

01:18.491 --> 01:20.057
Do you want to talk about it?

01:20.059 --> 01:22.059
No, I'm good. Yeah.
I'll miss her, but...

01:22.061 --> 01:24.027
we're still friends.
We're cool.

01:24.029 --> 01:26.062
I'm cool. Cool. NICK: All right.

01:26.696 --> 01:28.763
He is not good.

01:28.765 --> 01:32.732
Winston, get back here! We need
to powwow about May and Coach!

01:35.435 --> 01:37.669
Winnie's gonna need a minute.

01:44.543 --> 01:47.177
What are you
reading? What is...

01:47.179 --> 01:50.013
<i> One Woman's Journey</i>
<i> Up Inside Herself?</i>

01:50.015 --> 01:51.514
It's really inspiring.
I actually want to be

01:51.516 --> 01:52.915
the woman in this book.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.450
"Finding inner strength
in a time of crises."

01:55.452 --> 01:57.852
Cece, are you in crises?

01:57.854 --> 02:00.521
I'm fine. Cece's fine.

02:00.523 --> 02:02.623
How are you?
How's Fawn holding up?

02:02.625 --> 02:05.125
If you must know, my paramour
Councilwoman Fawn Moscato

02:05.127 --> 02:07.427
has been so strong
since the incident.

02:07.429 --> 02:08.895
(crowd gasping)

02:08.897 --> 02:10.963
You know, reporters
are calling it Panty-Gate.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.931
There's pictures
of her naked lady-bottom

02:12.933 --> 02:14.532
all over the Internet. Sid,

02:14.534 --> 02:16.300
put the
phone away.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.436
You picked it up right when
I said "naked lady-bottom."

02:19.438 --> 02:21.571
Please. You guys are good, then?

02:21.573 --> 02:23.739
You know,
'cause the last time we spoke,

02:23.741 --> 02:26.975
you said you were feeling
a little, you know, used.

02:26.977 --> 02:28.977
Well, not anymore.
We're a team now.

02:28.979 --> 02:30.311
Fawn and Schmidt.

02:30.313 --> 02:31.245
Fawmidt.

02:31.247 --> 02:33.747
Vomit?
No, Fawmidt.

02:33.749 --> 02:34.814
You're saying the word "vomit."

02:34.816 --> 02:36.382
No, I don't hear that, but okay.

02:36.384 --> 02:38.550
Fawn's holding a press
conference later today,

02:38.552 --> 02:40.451
and I don't mean to toot
my own shofar,

02:40.453 --> 02:42.419
but I'll be standing there
right by her side.

02:42.421 --> 02:43.553
So this scandal is actually

02:43.555 --> 02:44.787
bringing you two
closer together.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.289
Team Fawmidt
has never been stronger.

02:47.291 --> 02:48.990
I heard it there.

02:48.992 --> 02:51.092
Wow, that sounds
exactly like "vomit."

02:51.094 --> 02:53.661
That's a problem.
Mm-hmm.

02:53.663 --> 02:56.664
"Roughly the same length
as<i> The Pearl."</i>

02:56.666 --> 02:58.666
How is that a pull quote?

02:58.668 --> 03:00.734
And that...

03:00.736 --> 03:02.602
is how babies get made.

03:02.604 --> 03:03.970
It's gross, right?

03:03.972 --> 03:05.338
How does the sperm find the egg?

03:05.340 --> 03:07.306
Propelled by its tail,

03:07.308 --> 03:10.409
the sperm travels up the canal
until it reaches the egg.

03:10.411 --> 03:12.811
Now, for us,
it's only a couple of inches,

03:12.813 --> 03:16.747
but for Mr. Sperm there,
it's miles away.

03:16.749 --> 03:20.517
Miles and miles and miles away.

03:20.519 --> 03:22.418
(sighs)

03:22.420 --> 03:25.120
It's almost like...

03:25.122 --> 03:29.457
why would the egg want to be
so far away from the sperm?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.091
You know? Like, didn't
the egg and the sperm

03:31.093 --> 03:32.792
have a great time
together?

03:32.794 --> 03:34.994
And then you're just gonna
pack your bags and leave

03:34.996 --> 03:36.428
and go to New York?

03:36.430 --> 03:38.763
To play music
with some other sperm.

03:38.765 --> 03:41.599
You're just-just gonna leave?
You're gonna leave your sperm

03:41.601 --> 03:43.634
and go play music
with other sperms?!

03:43.636 --> 03:45.769
And I'm cool with that!
I'm cool with that!

03:45.771 --> 03:49.205
You know, I got eggs.
I have eggs on deck!

03:49.207 --> 03:50.806
This sperm got swag.
All those other sperms

03:50.808 --> 03:53.041
ain't got swag like me.
Can any other sperm

03:53.043 --> 03:57.211
sport this much green
and still look dope?

03:57.213 --> 03:58.612
No!

03:58.614 --> 04:01.514
That ain't tight!
This is tight!

04:01.516 --> 04:03.182
This is tight!

04:03.184 --> 04:05.551
(crying):
I just want you

04:05.553 --> 04:07.685
to come back, and I...
(sniffles)

04:09.688 --> 04:12.790
I guess I chose the wrong day
to observe Health.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.325
COACH (crying):
I miss her!

04:15.327 --> 04:16.959
May!

04:16.961 --> 04:19.795
Listen, thanks for standing
next to me up there, Ponyboy.

04:19.797 --> 04:21.129
I hope this show of remorse

04:21.131 --> 04:22.630
will keep these reporters
off my back.

04:22.632 --> 04:24.298
Oh, I know it will.
And then, you know what,

04:24.300 --> 04:25.799
once this is over,
maybe we get out of here

04:25.801 --> 04:27.634
for a little bit. Lay low, Oh.

04:27.636 --> 04:29.202
rent a cabin in the woods,
Yeah.

04:29.204 --> 04:31.571
read some poetry,
have horizontal sex.

04:31.573 --> 04:33.839
Okay, two of those three things
sound like fun. Now,

04:33.841 --> 04:36.474
here's your statement in case you're
asked any questions. Oh, a st...

04:36.476 --> 04:38.709
I'm not gonna need a statement.
I'm a seasoned improviser.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.577
Hey, guys.
We're the Belly Laughs.

04:40.579 --> 04:42.078
So I need a location.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.646
BOY:
How 'bout fat camp?

04:43.648 --> 04:46.682
(laughter)

04:46.684 --> 04:50.419
That's adorable. But just,
please, read what I wrote.

04:50.421 --> 04:52.421
I will. But I'm not gonna
do it until I get out there.

04:52.423 --> 04:54.389
You're gonna want me
in the moment for this.

04:54.391 --> 04:56.257
Okay.

04:57.058 --> 04:58.691
(reporters clamoring)

04:58.693 --> 05:00.159
Good afternoon.

05:00.161 --> 05:02.394
Um, before I answer
any of your questions,

05:02.396 --> 05:05.096
my partner would like
to read a statement.

05:05.098 --> 05:07.098
Honey.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.567
I am a sick man.

05:15.072 --> 05:16.772
On Saturday last,
Councilwoman Moscato

05:16.774 --> 05:20.275
was caught not wearing
underpants because I...

05:20.277 --> 05:23.044
I asked her
not to wear them.

05:23.046 --> 05:25.679
Why?

05:30.451 --> 05:33.686
Because it turns me on.

05:33.688 --> 05:35.854
What I did was wrong.

05:35.856 --> 05:37.555
I'm so sorry, Fawn.

05:37.557 --> 05:41.358
I'm sorry, Los Angeles.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.060
And I'm sorry
to the man upstairs,

05:44.062 --> 05:46.829
my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.234
Dress shirts on a Monday?
You know how it is.

05:53.236 --> 05:55.269
Coach breaks up with a lady,
we take him out,

05:55.271 --> 05:56.303
and he gets loaded.

05:56.305 --> 05:57.971
Yeah, I know how it usually goes

05:57.973 --> 06:00.039
when Coach breaks up with
a girl, but May is different.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.107
Sometimes she comes over
and they don't even have sex.

06:02.109 --> 06:04.142
I don't get that.
Trust me, I am right

06:04.144 --> 06:06.477
about this, just like
I was right about them fighting.

06:06.479 --> 06:07.911
I'm on, like, a streak here.

06:07.913 --> 06:11.381
I might just be...
an expert in love.

06:11.383 --> 06:14.484
Like a... you know,
like a love doctor, if you will.

06:14.486 --> 06:17.320
I will not. You are
the least qualified person

06:17.322 --> 06:20.489
to call themselves
a doctor of love.

06:20.491 --> 06:23.158
Exhibit "A": you dated me.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.292
I rest my case.
(chuckles)

06:24.294 --> 06:26.327
Court is adjourned.

06:26.329 --> 06:28.062
Guilty as charged.

06:28.064 --> 06:29.663
(laughs)

06:29.665 --> 06:31.064
Put... I would stop that.

06:31.066 --> 06:32.999
Case... rested.
Listen, I got to say

06:33.001 --> 06:35.067
I agree with Nick
on this one, Jess.

06:35.069 --> 06:37.936
I mean, it's been a whole day,
and KC still hasn't texted me.

06:37.938 --> 06:39.938
Well, that's just proof
that the bubble is working.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.273
Look, you guys,
Coach needs to talk to May.

06:42.275 --> 06:44.675
Trust me. He is in pain.

06:44.677 --> 06:49.078
I'm happy and I'm healthy
and I'm ready to party!

06:49.080 --> 06:50.779
(Nick and Winston laughing)
Let's get drunk!

06:50.781 --> 06:52.013
(whoops)
You're wrong.

06:52.015 --> 06:53.748
Coach. (chuckles)
(Coach grunts)

06:53.750 --> 06:55.015
Do you want to talk about
what happened today or...?

06:55.017 --> 06:56.016
Talk about what?

06:56.018 --> 06:57.917
Nah. (chuckles)

06:57.919 --> 07:00.252
(Nick and Winston laugh) Hey, um,
actually, can you do me a favor?

07:00.254 --> 07:01.786
May's gonna be recording later.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.754
She's gonna stop by
and pick up her rubber circle.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.289
May has a diaphragm?

07:05.291 --> 07:06.690
No, it's the thing
that you put on the floor

07:06.692 --> 07:07.791
to stabilize the cello.

07:07.793 --> 07:09.759
Condom.
No.

07:09.761 --> 07:11.427
No, it's the thing
you put on the floor

07:11.429 --> 07:13.061
to make sure
the cello stays put.

07:13.063 --> 07:14.128
Cello stabilizer.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.963
Oh, yeah.
Cello stabilizer.

07:15.965 --> 07:18.899
Oh. Well, wouldn't you like
to be here when she comes by?

07:18.901 --> 07:20.901
No, that's gonna be hella weird.
(laughter)

07:20.903 --> 07:22.402
I want to party!
Yeah!

07:22.404 --> 07:24.771
We 'bout to par...
Come on, party!

07:24.773 --> 07:28.441
I'm gonna do this
and gonna do this, this,

07:28.443 --> 07:29.475
this, this, this.

07:29.477 --> 07:31.610
(sighs)

07:31.612 --> 07:34.245
What was that speech?

07:34.247 --> 07:36.580
I'm sorry, okay? I told you to
read the statement beforehand,

07:36.582 --> 07:38.214
and then you told me
that terrifying story

07:38.216 --> 07:40.249
about doing improv
at a fat person's camp.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.583
I didn't know
that the statement

07:41.585 --> 07:43.918
was gonna blame me
for Panty-Gate.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.753
And by the way,
for your information,

07:45.755 --> 07:48.555
the Belly Laughs
did not "do" improv.

07:48.557 --> 07:50.657
We reinvented it.

07:50.659 --> 07:53.426
I know you must be embarrassed,
but... you saved me.

07:53.428 --> 07:55.561
Yeah, well, people
think I'm a sicko now.

07:55.563 --> 07:57.963
One of your aides spit at me.
Was it Shallon?

07:57.965 --> 08:00.565
Yeah, that's a lisp,
but still, he's fired.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.467
Look, if you want to leave,
I completely understand.

08:03.469 --> 08:05.235
But the truth is...

08:05.237 --> 08:08.071
I can't do this without you.

08:08.073 --> 08:11.240
Well, now Ponyboy is
feeling very conflicted.

08:11.242 --> 08:12.507
Just one last photo op.

08:12.509 --> 08:14.108
You and I having
a lovely evening.

08:14.110 --> 08:15.676
Show the press
everything's back to normal.

08:15.678 --> 08:19.112
And then I promise
it'll just all be about us.

08:19.114 --> 08:20.780
Could we do
horizontal sex?

08:20.782 --> 08:22.481
Yes.
With foreplay?

08:24.450 --> 08:26.751
It's a deal-b... It's a deal-breaker.
Uh... Yeah.

08:26.753 --> 08:29.754
It's a deal-breaker. Okay.
Fine, yes, fine, yes.

08:29.756 --> 08:30.988
Oh, God.

08:30.990 --> 08:32.356
No, please. Oh...

08:32.358 --> 08:33.857
Oh, God.

08:33.859 --> 08:35.925
(knocking)
May.

08:35.927 --> 08:36.992
Cece!

08:36.994 --> 08:38.860
So Coach and May
broke up?

08:38.862 --> 08:40.094
Long story short,

08:40.096 --> 08:41.195
they shouldn't have broken up,

08:41.197 --> 08:42.329
and I am the only person

08:42.331 --> 08:43.697
that sees this.

08:43.699 --> 08:45.265
I realize I'm kind of
an expert in love.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.634
A love doctor, if you will.

08:47.636 --> 08:49.135
Where are
your crackers?

08:49.137 --> 08:50.469
A-Above the fridge.

08:50.471 --> 08:52.037
Cece, did they raise
your tuition again?

08:52.039 --> 08:53.505
Why are you so hungry?

08:53.507 --> 08:57.708
I've decided I'm going to climb
Mount Shasta.

08:57.710 --> 08:58.875
By yourself?

08:58.877 --> 09:00.476
I'm leaving
for three weeks.

09:00.478 --> 09:02.110
I want to be like the woman
in the book;

09:02.112 --> 09:04.679
I want to go on a climbing trip
and find myself.

09:04.681 --> 09:07.982
Okay, um... Ceec,

09:07.984 --> 09:09.316
are you sure

09:09.318 --> 09:11.451
you're ready
for a climbing trip?

09:11.453 --> 09:13.152
Jess, I just...
I can't sit here

09:13.154 --> 09:16.321
and watch Schmidt with Fawn.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.657
And I don't think they're
breaking up any time soon, so...

09:19.659 --> 09:21.492
Cece, they're never gonna last.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.494
He doesn't really love her.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.028
Did he tell you that?

09:25.030 --> 09:27.330
No, but...

09:27.332 --> 09:29.899
as a doctor of love,
I sense these things.

09:29.901 --> 09:31.634
(knocking)

09:31.636 --> 09:34.436
The Love Doctor just knows.

09:37.373 --> 09:38.973
May.
Hi.

09:38.975 --> 09:41.342
Uh, I'm here for
my endpin anchor.

09:41.344 --> 09:42.209
Yeah.

09:42.211 --> 09:44.377
Ah, thank you.

09:44.379 --> 09:46.579
Very sorry to hear
about the breakup.

09:46.581 --> 09:47.546
Are you okay?

09:47.548 --> 09:49.414
Um, yeah. Yeah.

09:49.416 --> 09:51.382
I'm here to talk
if you ever need to.

09:51.384 --> 09:54.817
In hard times,
it's nice to have a friend, May.

09:54.819 --> 09:57.019
Thanks...

09:57.021 --> 09:58.387
Jess, right?

09:58.389 --> 10:00.222
Yes.
Well, uh...

10:00.224 --> 10:01.690
I'm in the middle of
a recording session.

10:01.692 --> 10:03.825
I got to get back to the
studio, so... see ya.

10:03.827 --> 10:06.394
Bye.

10:07.596 --> 10:10.597
Yeah, Jess, she looks
real broken up about it.

10:13.033 --> 10:16.402
(knocking)

10:16.404 --> 10:18.837
I... I'm a mess.

10:18.839 --> 10:20.839
I know!

10:20.841 --> 10:23.341
(May crying)

10:23.343 --> 10:25.376
(whispers):
The doctor is in.

10:25.378 --> 10:26.677
Wait, what?

10:26.679 --> 10:28.411
Nothing. Cry it out.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.848
Mmm! Ah.

10:32.850 --> 10:34.716
Wow.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.884
I've never seen Coach go
this hard after a breakup, man.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.852
You sure he's okay? It's
good, it's good, it's good.

10:38.854 --> 10:41.221
You treat an outside wound
with rubbing alcohol,

10:41.223 --> 10:43.423
you treat an inside wound
with drinking alcohol.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.791
That's science.

10:44.793 --> 10:45.958
I feel that, man.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.592
It is time to
turn things up.

10:47.594 --> 10:48.926
Sidney!

10:48.928 --> 10:51.161
Do what you do!
(chuckles)

10:54.598 --> 10:56.131
("Black Velvet"
by Alannah Myles playing)

10:56.133 --> 10:58.433
Aw...

10:58.435 --> 10:59.801
(chuckles)

10:59.803 --> 11:04.871
This... is... my... jam.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.539
MAY (muffled):<i> We've only been</i>
<i> dating for a few months.</i>

11:06.541 --> 11:08.274
I just thought that...

11:08.276 --> 11:10.876
that breaking up was, like, the
smart thing to do, you know?

11:10.878 --> 11:12.143
I know you're upset,

11:12.145 --> 11:14.578
sweetie, but I...
I can't understand

11:14.580 --> 11:17.146
anything you're saying
with the crackers.

11:18.214 --> 11:19.147
Do you love him?

11:19.149 --> 11:21.315
I think I do.

11:21.317 --> 11:23.250
Well, then maybe moving
to New York doesn't mean

11:23.252 --> 11:25.085
you have to break up.
(muffled): So you think

11:25.087 --> 11:28.555
that I should... that I should
ask Coach to move with me?

11:28.557 --> 11:30.623
Okay, how about
we put down the crackers?

11:31.391 --> 11:33.158
I think she wants Coach

11:33.160 --> 11:34.893
to move to New York
with her.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.462
Oh! Yes, yes!
I mean...

11:37.464 --> 11:40.932
Yeah? You-You... You think that he
would say yeah? Yeah. Definitely.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.634
He's crazy about you. He had a
meltdown today in health class.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.903
Now, the kids did learn that sex
is emotionally complicated,

11:46.905 --> 11:48.905
so it was a good class,
but trust me...

11:48.907 --> 11:51.807
What Jess is trying to say
here is that if you...

11:51.809 --> 11:54.976
if you really know
how you feel about someone,

11:54.978 --> 11:56.777
you need to act now.

11:56.779 --> 11:59.146
Wow. (laughs)

11:59.148 --> 12:00.514
Am I really doing this?

12:00.516 --> 12:02.115
Yeah, but not before
we clean your face,

12:02.117 --> 12:03.816
'cause it's caked in snot.

12:03.818 --> 12:07.686
WINSTON:
Ooh, yeah, Coach!

12:07.688 --> 12:09.187
Who you think
he's gonna hook up with?

12:09.189 --> 12:10.488
It's a tough Monday crowd. It...

12:10.490 --> 12:11.822
It's nearly impossible to say,

12:11.824 --> 12:13.123
but I'm gonna go
with the white bodysuit

12:13.125 --> 12:14.424
and, uh,
the leopard print leggings.

12:14.426 --> 12:16.359
She looks
smart to me.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.195
WINSTON: No way. No way. My money's
on the one with the wedding ring

12:19.197 --> 12:20.863
whose husband is clearly
over there in the corner

12:20.865 --> 12:22.130
spying on her.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.498
Yeah, he's not
happy about that.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.634
Oh, oh, ooh!
Dora the Explorer

12:26.636 --> 12:27.801
just entered the scene!
(laughs)

12:27.803 --> 12:30.103
You're tiny. I like it.

12:30.105 --> 12:32.338
NICK: There she g... Oh!
For the kiss!

12:32.340 --> 12:34.373
Oh!
The winner.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.640
The winner.

12:35.642 --> 12:36.874
What the hell?

12:36.876 --> 12:38.275
Oh. May's here. Coach!

12:38.277 --> 12:40.610
(both grunting, growling)

12:40.612 --> 12:41.944
(Nick and Winston
whistling, grunting)

12:41.946 --> 12:43.946
May here, she here!

12:45.214 --> 12:47.181
Wh-Wha... Uh, May!

12:47.183 --> 12:48.482
Wh-What are... what
are you doing here?

12:48.484 --> 12:50.350
No, come on.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.018
No, no...

12:52.020 --> 12:54.387
♪ In a flash, he is gone ♪

12:54.389 --> 12:56.188
♪ It happened so soon... ♪

12:56.190 --> 12:58.623
In case you were
wondering, she, uh...

12:58.625 --> 13:02.593
she did get her little
rubber holder thing.

13:10.134 --> 13:12.902
Coach, um, I wanted
to apologize.

13:12.904 --> 13:14.703
Not now, honey.
He needs some time, honey.

13:14.705 --> 13:16.638
I brought over a beer.
We'll take that beer.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.039
Give us that beer, honey.

13:19.074 --> 13:21.408
Sorry.

13:21.410 --> 13:23.743
I'm not a freaking love doctor.

13:23.745 --> 13:26.312
I'm Dr. E.D. Ote.

13:26.314 --> 13:27.846
(chuckles)
Dr. Idiot.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.247
Yeah, I get it. I just
never understood

13:29.249 --> 13:31.315
the whole love doctor
thing, anyway.

13:31.317 --> 13:34.418
I guess I was just hoping that
with all the mistakes I've made,

13:34.420 --> 13:36.720
at least I could
help you guys find love.

13:36.722 --> 13:40.190
That I didn't go through
all that for no reason.

13:40.192 --> 13:41.991
Yeah, but no one has
the answers, you know?

13:41.993 --> 13:45.160
It's love, it makes no sense.
It's messy.

13:45.162 --> 13:47.895
There's no such thing
as a love doctor.

13:48.930 --> 13:51.231
You know what, Cece?

13:51.233 --> 13:53.933
Go on your trip.
Go get over Schmidt.

13:53.935 --> 13:55.534
Don't listen to me.

13:55.536 --> 13:57.402
I'm gonna climb that mountain.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.270
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.238
But I'm not gonna
do it for Schmidt,

14:01.240 --> 14:02.707
I'm gonna do it for me.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.841
Good. Go.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.243
I love you, girl.
Love you, too.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.882
Hey, don't smile.
Don't smile.

14:12.884 --> 14:14.216
Look sadder
that you're buying underpants.

14:14.218 --> 14:15.383
Underpants make you
very, very sad.

14:15.385 --> 14:17.351
Oh, I hate being
here so much.

14:17.353 --> 14:20.187
These underpants make
me so uncomfortable.

14:20.189 --> 14:22.989
That's perfect. There's that
fat boy improv training.

14:22.991 --> 14:25.358
Now, next, I'm going to ask
for something with a little more

14:25.360 --> 14:27.193
coverage; you're gonna flip out,
say you can't take it anymore,

14:27.195 --> 14:28.861
and leave the store.

14:28.863 --> 14:30.562
Then tomorrow, we enter you into
some kind of rehab facility.

14:30.564 --> 14:32.797
When you get out, we'll announce
that we're getting married.

14:32.799 --> 14:35.166
Married? What? I don't...
Shh. Yes. Shh.

14:35.168 --> 14:36.634
Yes, yes. Okay.

14:36.636 --> 14:39.670
So what I say is we build
on this momentum, okay?

14:39.672 --> 14:42.239
And we get married. I know
it's not the most romantic

14:42.241 --> 14:44.908
idea in the world,
but we'd be happy.

14:44.910 --> 14:46.809
And then, we play
our cards right,

14:46.811 --> 14:50.512
you and I are living
in the mayor's mansion by 2020.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.081
Fawn. Fawn.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.182
No.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.317
No? Oh, n-no to some of it?

14:56.319 --> 14:59.053
No to all of it. We can't get
married. I barely even know you.

14:59.055 --> 15:00.654
You... You know me.

15:00.656 --> 15:01.921
The real you, Fawn.

15:01.923 --> 15:03.355
This is the real me.

15:03.357 --> 15:06.891
I'm a politician,
not in<i> The Vagina Monologues.</i>

15:06.893 --> 15:08.993
I mean, what do you want?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.828
I can get you anything you want.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.329
You'll be rich,
I'll be powerful.

15:12.331 --> 15:14.597
I'm realizing...

15:14.599 --> 15:18.200
just now that it's
<i> not</i> what I want.

15:18.202 --> 15:20.235
I don't want
any of that.

15:20.237 --> 15:21.903
I want to be in love.

15:23.205 --> 15:25.606
I want to be... I want
to be crazy in love.

15:25.608 --> 15:28.041
Okay, well, certainly
don't quote Beyoncé

15:28.043 --> 15:29.842
and then pretend like
you just thought of it.

15:29.844 --> 15:31.343
Uh, uh, I want to
be drunk in love.

15:31.345 --> 15:33.545
But that's also
a Beyoncé lyric.

15:33.547 --> 15:35.780
Come on, Fawn.

15:35.782 --> 15:38.182
You're not really
in love with me.

15:38.184 --> 15:40.384
I'm not really in
love with-with you.

15:40.386 --> 15:45.321
We just look great together
buying underpants.

15:46.356 --> 15:49.524
Are you breaking up with me?

15:49.526 --> 15:52.560
I guess I kind of am.

15:52.562 --> 15:54.962
Well, um...

15:54.964 --> 15:57.264
I don't want this

15:57.266 --> 16:01.067
to come out
the wrong way, but...

16:01.069 --> 16:03.436
does this mean I lose your vote?

16:03.438 --> 16:05.371
(chuckles)

16:05.373 --> 16:07.539
Never.

16:08.607 --> 16:10.441
(cameras clicking)

16:12.644 --> 16:15.612
(shouting): I just can't stand
to be in here any longer!

16:15.614 --> 16:17.647
Surrounded...

16:17.649 --> 16:19.582
by these underpants!

16:19.584 --> 16:22.918
Red ones and yellow ones
and blue ones and pink ones!

16:22.920 --> 16:27.087
And this woman with her
brassiere-slash-teddy!

16:27.089 --> 16:29.389
Underpants everywhere!
They're driving me nuts!

16:29.391 --> 16:31.724
I feel like I got
underpants all over my body!

16:31.726 --> 16:34.426
Schmidt out.
This is ridiculous.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.929
Enough is enough.
Get out of here, paparazzi.

16:37.931 --> 16:41.565
No, leave me...
Get-get out of my way, sir.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.410
I just want to say something.
No.

16:54.412 --> 16:56.178
And then I'll leave.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.979
Look, I'll never get involved in
your personal life ever again.

16:57.981 --> 17:00.247
Okay? Because I have no
idea what I'm talking about.

17:00.249 --> 17:02.182
And I know that now.

17:02.184 --> 17:03.950
You could just... you could just
troll for basic bitches

17:03.952 --> 17:06.252
at the juice bar,
and I will say, mm, nothing.

17:06.254 --> 17:09.488
Okay? So, look, I was
wrong, and I'm sorry.

17:09.490 --> 17:10.888
I do love her.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.325
I'm crazy about her.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.026
Yes! I was right!

17:17.028 --> 17:19.928
(laughs)
Love Doctor! I'm back.

17:19.930 --> 17:22.130
Really? I thought
it was just a regular breakup.

17:22.132 --> 17:24.832
But in all fairness, I hadn't
thought about it that hard.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.700
I mean, what do I do, man?

17:26.702 --> 17:28.868
You know, it's like
she's going to New York.

17:28.870 --> 17:30.870
Yup. I can't go to New York with her.
That's crazy.

17:30.872 --> 17:33.873
You know? I like my sun on the
right and my ocean on the left.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.174
It's a rule of mine.

17:35.176 --> 17:36.975
Plus, I'd have
to leave you guys.

17:36.977 --> 17:39.177
Can't leave you
guys, I mean,

17:39.179 --> 17:41.344
I finally have a home.

17:44.181 --> 17:48.116
All right, flash forward
to the future.

17:48.118 --> 17:50.885
40, 50 years.

17:50.887 --> 17:53.988
You're married. Kids, grandkids.
Mm-hmm.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.856
I'm long dead.
Naturally.

17:55.858 --> 17:56.656
Of course.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.024
And you look over

17:58.026 --> 17:59.325
to the woman sitting
next to you.

17:59.327 --> 18:00.859
And she's gray.

18:00.861 --> 18:03.461
She's old. She has that,
like, grandma smell.

18:03.463 --> 18:06.230
You have a grandpa smell, but you got...
Grandmas always smell like...

18:06.232 --> 18:07.831
like right when you
open a cupboard.

18:07.833 --> 18:10.300
Yeah, she has that smell, but...
Mm-hmm.

18:10.302 --> 18:11.401
...you love her.

18:11.403 --> 18:13.536
Be honest with yourself.

18:13.538 --> 18:16.005
Is that fat old lady sitting
beside you... Mm...

18:16.007 --> 18:18.240
Honestly, right now, in my head,
I'm just picturing, like,

18:18.242 --> 18:20.175
a beanbag chair
with a wig on it.

18:20.177 --> 18:22.877
Okay. We have gone too much
into the description. Okay.

18:22.879 --> 18:26.313
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Is that May?

18:27.315 --> 18:30.149
I think so.

18:31.918 --> 18:34.686
Well, that's big.

18:34.688 --> 18:36.387
Let's go get her.

18:36.389 --> 18:37.921
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:37.923 --> 18:40.023
JESS: Whoo-hoo! Let's go get May.
Yeah!

18:40.025 --> 18:42.925
Hey, Jess, she texted me back!
The blank bubble worked!

18:42.927 --> 18:45.861
Guys?

18:45.863 --> 18:48.029
Have you seen my white friends?

18:48.031 --> 18:49.930
In 40 years,
when we're old and...

18:49.932 --> 18:52.599
Do it.
...a mess of fat,

18:52.601 --> 18:55.702
loose skin hanging,
I have boobs,

18:55.704 --> 18:56.736
and you've got hair

18:56.738 --> 18:58.270
on your face...

18:58.272 --> 18:59.738
Holding my rock sack
while I'm sitting on the toilet

18:59.740 --> 19:01.239
so it doesn't fall
in the water.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.040
What are you saying?

19:03.042 --> 19:06.843
I'm saying, as you get older,
your testicles lengthen.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.045
(scoffs) No, what I'm
saying is I love you.

19:09.047 --> 19:10.679
Oh.
And that I would be

19:10.681 --> 19:13.848
a fool if I let you leave
to New York

19:13.850 --> 19:15.516
without even fighting for us.

19:20.021 --> 19:22.022
Ernie...

19:22.024 --> 19:24.624
I love you, too.

19:26.593 --> 19:29.194
But I... I can't stay here.

19:29.196 --> 19:30.962
I don't want you to stay here.

19:30.964 --> 19:34.098
Um... look, I know we haven't
been dating that long,

19:34.100 --> 19:36.066
and, um, this might seem crazy,
but I was won...

19:36.068 --> 19:38.401
Will you move to
New York with me?

19:38.403 --> 19:40.736
Yes! That! That's what I...

19:40.738 --> 19:42.537
Yes?! Yeah, that's what
I wanted to do, yeah.

19:42.539 --> 19:44.272
(screeches) Right. So,
we're moving to New York?

19:44.274 --> 19:46.307
We're moving to New York.
We're moving to New York!

19:46.309 --> 19:48.108
Jersey City.
What?

19:48.110 --> 19:50.343
Jersey City!
Jersey... I don't...

19:54.114 --> 19:55.447
NICK:
Well, this is all you, Jess.

19:55.449 --> 19:57.115
Come on.
This is<i> all</i> you.

19:57.117 --> 20:00.218
I mean it. If Coach were
hanging out with me,

20:00.220 --> 20:02.920
we'd be beating up a priest right now.
(laughs)

20:02.922 --> 20:04.888
You had a lot
to do with this, too.

20:04.890 --> 20:07.323
No, really. All that stuff about

20:07.325 --> 20:09.758
"Who do you see
yourself next to?"

20:09.760 --> 20:11.292
That's-that's really good.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.094
Do you do that?

20:14.096 --> 20:17.563
Who-who<i> do</i> you
see yourself next to?

20:18.431 --> 20:20.465
Winston mostly.

20:20.467 --> 20:23.501
Ah. Yeah, me, too, actually.

20:23.503 --> 20:24.935
(both laugh)

20:24.937 --> 20:27.404
I just see a really old Winston.
(chuckles)

20:27.406 --> 20:30.340
Eating handfuls of birdseed
out of the bag.

20:30.342 --> 20:31.808
He gets really into birds.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.910
Hey!

20:33.912 --> 20:36.245
Play some music!
Play some music!

20:37.513 --> 20:40.314
(playing romantic
classical music)

20:51.526 --> 20:53.260
I'm sorry about Fawn.
Yeah, sorry, buddy.

20:53.262 --> 20:54.761
Yeah, you guys
were good together.

20:54.763 --> 20:56.429
She was fine.
Okay, that's enough.

20:56.431 --> 20:58.197
I know you guys didn't like her.
Hated her guts.

20:58.199 --> 21:00.465
So much! JESS: Wait. What
are we watching right now?

21:00.467 --> 21:02.633
That girl just
took her boobs out!

21:02.635 --> 21:05.002
Nick, why are you watching smut?
It was already in the DVD player.

21:05.004 --> 21:07.871
I didn't want to get up and get it.
Schmidt, are you sitting on my pillow?

21:07.873 --> 21:10.506
Who leaves porn in the DVD? What's it
doing out here in the first place?

21:10.508 --> 21:11.992
The only thing we use it for.
Might as well

21:12.017 --> 21:13.509
just leave it in. I'm
sleeping on the couch.

21:13.511 --> 21:15.511
Furguson and I are fighting.
SCHMIDT: Why is that pillow wet?

21:15.513 --> 21:17.112
NICK: It's a good story. Let's
just watch and see what happens.

21:17.114 --> 21:20.181
What are you smiling at?
Nothing.

21:20.183 --> 21:22.316
For crying out loud, take this
soft-core off the TV right now.

21:22.318 --> 21:23.717
Why is this pillow wet?
Furguson...

21:23.719 --> 21:25.885
Jess, I have to see
how the story ends.

21:25.887 --> 21:28.687
There isn't any plot! This is the
wrong time to stop this, trust me.

21:28.689 --> 21:30.855
Get you and your wet pillow and
your big old legs out of here.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.857
Nick, I know you want that.
I don't want to eat that.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.159
Get that damn pizza out of my mouth!
(laughter)

21:35.161 --> 21:36.960
