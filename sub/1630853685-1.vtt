WEBVTT

01:21.790 --> 01:23.125
We've all heard that thing

01:23.208 --> 01:25.502
about the butterfly flapping its wings
in Africa,

01:25.586 --> 01:29.006
and months later
there's a hurricane in Miami.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.299
Well, if you haven't, look it up.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.679
It means things you don't think
are connected actually are.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.816
I never knew this girl.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.403
Never met her.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.993
This is the life she knew.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.847
And this is the life I knew.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.398
There I am. There's the kid.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.442
Did you just call yourself "the kid"?

02:30.526 --> 02:33.529
Wait, isn't this the game
you fumbled three times in one quarter?

02:34.238 --> 02:36.907
This is also the game
where I did this, motherfucker.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.702
You wouldn't think so,
but it is all connected.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.164
These knuckleheads. That girl on the bike.

02:44.248 --> 02:47.584
Wait. Who's that
streaking down the sideline?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.711
Kankakee's favorite son.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.672
Me, with my million-dollar smile.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.091
Owner of grad school records
that still stand.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.427
Given not one, not two,
but three fucking scholarship offers.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.929
Hey, it was four, actually.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.268
Christ, Jimmy, you really were something.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.022
What about me?

03:09.106 --> 03:10.858
Well, he made even you look good.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.610
Pride and joy of Kankakee.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.532
-See?
-Okay.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.034
Try not to burn the place down,

03:21.118 --> 03:22.744
and remember to lock up this time.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.496
-Yeah.
-Wait, what's with the pillow?

03:26.582 --> 03:27.791
Anybody heard from Danny?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.423
Here's the real play. Watch this shit.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.008
Right here. Right there.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.843
You fucking has-been pretty boy.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.280
You know those times where
you think something's gonna go one way,

03:59.156 --> 04:00.324
but it goes sideways?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.120
If I had to pick the moment,

04:06.205 --> 04:08.498
here's where it all started to go sideways
for me.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.837
Like, for fucking ever.

04:29.645 --> 04:30.646
Hiya, Jimmy.

04:31.522 --> 04:32.981
-Hi, Rog.
-Hop in.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.816
What's with the pillow?

04:34.900 --> 04:38.237
Well, last time I saw you, you said
you kept getting cricks in your neck.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.321
I used to get 'em too.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.822
Discovered this pillow.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.407
Never got 'em again.

04:42.491 --> 04:47.246
You are the most profoundly considerate
motherfucker I've ever met.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.164
I thank you, my good man.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.457
Put it in the back.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.346
What's with the orange shotgun?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.348
I got a shipment of bean bags.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.142
You know the kind cops fire
at riots and shit?

05:09.226 --> 05:10.936
They trick the guns out with weird colors

05:11.019 --> 05:13.730
so they don't load live rounds
during protests,

05:13.814 --> 05:14.857
kill some poor fucker

05:14.940 --> 05:17.192
who's just asking to be treated
like a human being.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.031
So appreciative you came in person
to deal with this. That it--

05:24.324 --> 05:25.826
Touches me in a deep place.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.204
I'm so sorry about that last shipment.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.039
Mistakes happen.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.334
Not a whole kilo, man. I've--

05:36.086 --> 05:37.379
It's fucking embarrassing.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.214
I mean, I've never been light before.

05:39.798 --> 05:43.635
Not so much as a gram with anyone, ever.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.388
Why would I claim I got shorted?

05:47.139 --> 05:48.891
Hard to know a man's heart.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.189
Come on now.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.831
How did you know
the shortage was on my end?

06:12.915 --> 06:16.293
I know because my guy told me.
And I trust my guy, Danny.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.171
And why do you trust Danny, man?

06:19.254 --> 06:20.589
We grew up together.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.134
That's adorable.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.726
Jimmy. I'm sorry, Jim.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.146
-Danny.
-Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.397
What did you do?

06:38.690 --> 06:39.858
Tell him.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.111
Tell him.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.324
I stole your key, man.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.910
I needed to get right with Bern's people.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.204
We knew it wasn't us.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.748
I had no idea.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.416
He told me that.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.252
No, Rog, no!

07:00.045 --> 07:01.588
-Okay.
-Bean bag.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.466
Okay, he clipped the key.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.636
Okay? Here's a key.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.350
And a second.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.811
For your trouble.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.524
No!

07:21.942 --> 07:23.402
Fuck, man!

07:24.403 --> 07:25.404
Okay.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.114
Not a bean bag.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.700
And a third for our friendship.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.289
You know, this isn't just about the money.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.083
Come on. Nothing's just about money,
but they mostly are.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.170
He stole from me.

07:41.253 --> 07:44.173
No, he stole from me.
I'd already paid you.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.509
I came here today to be compensated
if there had been some kind of mistake,

07:47.593 --> 07:48.719
but there wasn't.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.054
Just this asshole stealing from me.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.849
-But blaming me.
-No, I never blamed you.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.517
-I didn't--
-Shut the fuck up!

07:57.477 --> 08:02.983
Rog. This guy, I've known him
since first grade. He's like family.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.985
Be like if you were asked
to give up your own brother.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.403
No matter what, could you do it?

08:06.486 --> 08:07.988
You still have half the bag.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.115
My family would be worth the whole bag.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.125
I think we come from
different types of family.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.587
So, you're saying his life is
only worth three kilos?

08:23.670 --> 08:26.465
His life is worth
three times what you lost,

08:26.548 --> 08:27.883
because you lost nothing!

08:27.966 --> 08:29.593
He's only worth three kilos?

08:29.676 --> 08:33.347
Yes! Okay, his life is only worth
three kilos to me!

08:43.690 --> 08:49.279
All I ask of the people I do business with
is their authentic self.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.158
Nice to see you, Jimmy.

08:55.744 --> 09:00.791
You can use the cart to transport
that young rascal to the car.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.026
Have you had a look at the menu, sir?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.574
Jesus. No. I'm sorry…

10:17.993 --> 10:18.994
Rochelle.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.416
Could I get a water, please?

10:24.499 --> 10:26.877
And I'll have an answer for you
by the time you're back?

10:26.960 --> 10:27.961
Of course, sir.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.464
Jimmy.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.592
Of course, Jimmy.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.105
Yeah.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.251
Hands, motherfucker! Hands!

11:54.798 --> 11:56.049
You smiling now, bitch?

12:06.643 --> 12:08.020
Can I get up now, please?

12:08.520 --> 12:09.897
You just lie there and take it.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.441
We're clear.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.525
Turn it off.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.452
Damn, Jimbo.
What you get up to last night?

12:28.332 --> 12:30.083
You even know her name?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.251
Rochelle.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.546
Her last name?

12:46.350 --> 12:48.393
Planning to shoot up
a local middle school?

12:48.477 --> 12:49.728
That's federal.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.402
Fuck is this, Jimbo?

12:58.570 --> 13:00.656
Jimmy. It's an AK-47.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.200
It's a "no possibility
of reduced sentence."

13:03.784 --> 13:04.993
I got great lawyers.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.666
They turn water into wine?

13:20.217 --> 13:22.719
Hey! You got a visitor.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.228
Window one!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.896
They tried that last time…

13:33.897 --> 13:36.233
Keene. Next up, window two.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.125
Window three, you're up.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.293
You okay?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.838
Did your mother come visit you yet?

13:57.921 --> 14:01.216
She's still pissed I got Tim mixed up
in that thing a while back.

14:01.300 --> 14:05.137
Well… at least your brother's gonna walk.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.682
I'm not?

14:09.183 --> 14:11.226
I talked to some of the guys.

14:11.310 --> 14:16.273
They said the prosecutor, Beaumont,
he's trying to prove something with you.

14:17.566 --> 14:18.567
Prove what?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.777
That he's not part of the machine.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.738
I'm not part of the machine.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.073
I was.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.618
My family.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.204
Your mother's family.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.457
Tell me there's a way out of this.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.708
Not a quick one.

14:35.501 --> 14:36.919
Window four, that's it.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.754
You'll get five years.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.380
Five--

14:41.048 --> 14:42.799
Four with good behavior.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.928
The low end
of the sentencing guidelines is

14:46.011 --> 14:49.348
if you take the plea, you get two years.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.518
They're not gonna give you two years.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.229
Why not?

14:55.312 --> 14:56.355
The guns.

14:57.064 --> 15:02.528
You're not some homey who's running around
capping grandmothers, doing a drive-by.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.112
You didn't sell crack, right?

15:04.196 --> 15:07.074
You're a good kid
who strayed off the path.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.536
You'll have to do the midrange.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.205
How do you know?

15:14.915 --> 15:17.376
I was a cop for 23 years.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.964
And I asked around,
and they all said the same thing.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.383
Midrange of the guidelines.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.260
Five.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.427
Out in four.

15:28.679 --> 15:29.721
I…

15:31.014 --> 15:33.433
I never wanted this for you.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.522
I wanted a totally different deal.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.484
Like what?

15:43.318 --> 15:44.444
Like I said.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.529
No.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.072
What?

15:47.573 --> 15:51.285
For you to have,

15:51.368 --> 15:52.369
you know…

15:52.452 --> 15:53.579
No, I don't.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.875
A wife. Kids.

15:58.584 --> 16:01.628
A fucking dog to play Frisbee with.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.006
And a steady paycheck.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.175
Pension at the end.

16:07.759 --> 16:08.760
I do--

16:10.137 --> 16:11.305
I couldn't have…

16:12.681 --> 16:13.724
What?

16:15.642 --> 16:18.103
…helped you if I lived that life.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.902
I still wanted it for you.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.410
I know.

16:35.204 --> 16:36.455
I know you did, Dad.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.336
You just never mentioned it before.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.215
Four! Window four, all done.

16:46.924 --> 16:52.221
Take the deal. Okay? Plea out.

17:01.230 --> 17:05.025
Okay. In the case of the United States
versus James Keene…

17:06.108 --> 17:08.487
Mr. Beaumont, am I to understand

17:08.569 --> 17:11.698
that the defendant has entered into
a plea agreement with your office?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.076
He has, Your Honor.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.078
And Mr. Steinbeck,

17:16.161 --> 17:19.080
is your client fully aware
of what he's pleading to today?

17:20.207 --> 17:21.208
He is, Your Honor.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.711
Mr. Keene.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.641
Police officer's son, correct?

17:38.976 --> 17:40.227
Yes, sir.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.272
Star athlete at Kankakee High.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.441
I see you're quite generous
with a few local charities.

17:47.442 --> 17:51.113
But what you're pleading guilty to today
is the sale and trafficking of narcotics,

17:51.196 --> 17:53.657
the possession of paraphernalia
associated with the same,

17:54.241 --> 17:57.369
and possession
of multiple illegal firearms.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.456
So, how plead you?

18:02.875 --> 18:03.876
Guilty.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.713
The sheer amount of narcotics
that you trafficked in, Mr. Keene,

18:07.796 --> 18:11.175
is enough to push your sentence
to 25 years.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.553
Which you most certainly
would have gotten at minimum

18:14.636 --> 18:16.305
if your case had gone to trial.

18:16.889 --> 18:19.391
But you did the smart thing today.
You pled.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.686
Still, there are the weapons,
which one presumes

18:22.769 --> 18:25.189
you were prepared to use
against other human beings

18:25.272 --> 18:26.940
to protect your narcotics.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.194
Therefore,

18:30.277 --> 18:33.030
it is the judgment of the court
the defendant be committed

18:33.113 --> 18:36.491
to the custody of the attorney general
of the United States,

18:36.575 --> 18:38.493
or her authorized representative,

18:39.369 --> 18:42.664
for the minimum guideline term
of 120 months.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.586
Bailiff.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.839
Ten years?

18:50.923 --> 18:53.926
Ten fucking years? Are you kidding me?

18:54.009 --> 18:56.929
You lied to me, Beaumont!
You fucking lied to me!

19:19.159 --> 19:20.577
You know what this is about?

19:47.479 --> 19:48.647
On or off?

19:49.314 --> 19:50.315
Off.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.580
I'm Special Agent Lauren McCauley.

20:04.663 --> 20:06.456
You can call me that or Lauren.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.834
I remember you don't like "Jimbo."

20:09.626 --> 20:10.669
Jimmy, please.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.505
And you know Mr. Beaumont.

20:16.925 --> 20:20.512
Mr. Beaumont sandbagged me
into accepting a five-year plea

20:20.596 --> 20:22.514
when he knew I'd get ten.

20:22.598 --> 20:23.807
So you remember it?

20:24.474 --> 20:26.268
No possibility of parole.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.353
Who takes that deal?

20:29.354 --> 20:30.355
You.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.566
You're a drug dealer.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.986
And you played chicken with us,
and you lost.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.156
Embrace that concept.

20:39.781 --> 20:40.908
Now, sit down.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.627
I hear you're making a real go of prison.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.337
No major beefs.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.631
Seem to get along
with most of the dominant gangs

20:55.714 --> 20:58.008
and successfully avoid
the ones you don't know yet.

20:58.091 --> 21:02.054
And… you've developed a sideline in here?

21:02.137 --> 21:03.305
No shit.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.307
That's in there?

21:05.390 --> 21:07.100
You use your profits to buy

21:08.769 --> 21:11.396
fresh vegetables and lean cuts of meat?

21:11.480 --> 21:12.523
Prison food sucks.

21:12.606 --> 21:14.149
So does prison life,

21:14.233 --> 21:16.443
but you seem to have
grabbed it by the balls.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.780
What is this sideline, by the way?

21:22.491 --> 21:23.617
Just a service.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.285
He's so modest.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.912
You rent porno mags, right?

21:27.538 --> 21:31.291
Hustler. Penthouse. Barely Legal.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.086
How's that work?

21:35.170 --> 21:37.464
They pay for half-hour blocks.

21:38.423 --> 21:41.260
Must be a lot of--
What do they call it in retail? Breakage?

21:42.427 --> 21:44.221
I turn my inventory over a lot.

21:44.304 --> 21:47.391
That's what you called drugs too.
Your "inventory."

21:47.933 --> 21:49.309
At least on the tapes I heard.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.941
I'm not surprised you're thriving in here,
Jimmy.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.067
I'm not thriving.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.820
Because you're a charming guy.
Everyone likes you.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.239
I've heard you talk
to Mexican cartel guys,

22:02.322 --> 22:03.782
Cabrini-Green bangers,

22:03.866 --> 22:06.910
Outfit goombahs in their tracksuits
at the Elmwood Park Social Club.

22:06.994 --> 22:08.704
You get along with everyone.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.623
I've noticed something else.

22:11.707 --> 22:12.791
After a certain point,

22:13.876 --> 22:15.794
they do most of the talking.

22:17.629 --> 22:18.463
I'm sorry?

22:18.547 --> 22:20.257
You've got your patter,
your funny story or two,

22:20.340 --> 22:23.468
but then you settle back
and just let them run their mouths.

22:23.552 --> 22:25.053
Take me.

22:25.137 --> 22:27.848
Something in those soulful eyes of yours.

22:28.932 --> 22:32.019
The way you sit so still,
so at peace with yourself.

22:32.728 --> 22:36.190
It makes me want to babble, man.
Unlock myself.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.442
You mentioned a point a while back?

22:38.525 --> 22:41.320
You in a rush?
'Cause we can let you get back to it.

22:43.197 --> 22:44.656
No. I'm fine.

22:44.740 --> 22:47.117
You got porn to sell, veggies to procure,

22:47.201 --> 22:48.243
and only

22:49.453 --> 22:51.705
nine years,
three months left on your sentence?

22:51.788 --> 22:54.082
-Just tell me what you want.
-I don't wanna hold you up.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.792
Just fucking tell me why I'm here.

22:58.128 --> 22:59.129
Temper.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.382
Not as cool as he thinks.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.059
We would like you
to transfer to another prison

23:12.142 --> 23:14.853
and befriend someone
to elicit a confession.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.650
We need the precise location
of a dead body.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.530
You need it?

23:24.613 --> 23:27.741
We suspect that the man
that you'll read about in that file

23:27.824 --> 23:30.160
has killed 14 women, maybe more.

23:30.244 --> 23:34.373
But we only tied him to two.
And we only have one of the bodies.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.876
We'd like to find the other one.
And maybe 12 more.

23:41.630 --> 23:44.091
And this prison where the guy is?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.262
It's in Springfield, Missouri.

23:49.179 --> 23:52.349
Maximum security,
specializing in the criminally insane.

23:56.645 --> 24:01.942
So… you want me to check in to hell,

24:03.318 --> 24:05.153
cozy up to a fucking demon,

24:05.237 --> 24:10.742
and ask him all casual,
"Hey, so where'd you bury 13 bodies?"

24:12.452 --> 24:13.579
Is that right?

24:21.295 --> 24:24.381
Not for all the fucking money
in the world.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.178
How about freedom?

24:31.972 --> 24:35.058
A complete commutation of your sentence.

24:40.981 --> 24:42.149
If I transfer?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.693
If you transfer.

24:46.111 --> 24:49.573
And if you get the location
of Patricia Reitler's body.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.491
No body, no release.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.411
No body, no release.

25:03.962 --> 25:04.796
No.

25:06.423 --> 25:07.674
No?

25:07.758 --> 25:08.884
No.

25:11.011 --> 25:14.515
His conviction's on appeal.
He could win and walk.

25:14.598 --> 25:20.437
If he walks, he'll kill again and again
until he fucks up and gets caught.

25:20.521 --> 25:23.732
The last time,
he killed 14 girls before he got caught.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.984
And it won't have anything to do with me.

25:26.068 --> 25:27.319
It will.

25:27.402 --> 25:30.239
You had the chance to stop him,
and you didn't take it.

25:30.322 --> 25:36.537
Look, I'm sorry about these women,
but I don't know them.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.331
And if he gets out,
I won't know the next ones he kills.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.041
I might be sad about it, but…

25:41.124 --> 25:43.252
This kind of deal
won't walk through the door twice.

25:43.335 --> 25:49.591
So, before you spend the next ten years
wondering why you didn't take it…

25:53.303 --> 25:54.555
look at the file.

26:01.270 --> 26:05.023
At the very least,
it'll make unique reading material.

26:10.571 --> 26:12.155
Your attorney has our contact info.

26:52.863 --> 26:54.114
Come on, Brooke!

26:56.575 --> 26:58.452
Come on, Brookie!

26:58.535 --> 27:00.787
-She hung onto it.
-Holy shit. She did!

27:00.871 --> 27:01.955
Okay.

27:02.039 --> 27:04.208
-Honey, you're going the wrong direction!
-Honey, the other way!

27:04.291 --> 27:06.251
-Wrong direction!
-The other way!

27:11.381 --> 27:13.300
Well, she runs pretty fast.

27:15.219 --> 27:16.220
Yeah. Not bad, right?

27:18.347 --> 27:20.307
Will he be home for dinner?

27:20.390 --> 27:21.558
Not likely.

27:22.476 --> 27:23.852
We found Jessica Roach.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.574
Line it up. Here we go. First down.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.647
Over there. Yeah.

30:39.965 --> 30:41.842
He stepped out right about here.

30:42.342 --> 30:43.343
What did he look like?

30:43.927 --> 30:46.221
He was white. That's about all I saw.

30:46.722 --> 30:50.142
Was he short? Tall? Bald? Not bald?

30:51.101 --> 30:53.979
I didn't get a good look at him.
He hopped in a van and drove off.

30:54.605 --> 30:55.856
What color van?

30:56.440 --> 31:00.068
It was like a gray or brown--

31:00.569 --> 31:02.863
It was night.
It could have been green too, or black.

31:03.572 --> 31:05.199
I know it was a Dodge, for sure.

31:06.909 --> 31:09.161
You don't know the color of the van,
but you know…

31:09.244 --> 31:11.622
I'm a mechanic.
I know a Dodge when I see one.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.886
Vermilion County
Sheriff's Department. Can I help you?

31:27.804 --> 31:28.805
He sure is.

31:39.608 --> 31:44.321
Hey, Len.
You filed a report a couple of weeks ago

31:44.404 --> 31:47.241
on a possible 647 over at Whittier?

31:47.324 --> 31:50.494
Yep.
Two 14-year-old girls riding their bikes.

31:50.577 --> 31:52.955
Said this perv in a van kept passing them.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.706
Told them he liked their boobies.

31:55.791 --> 31:57.626
-He said "boobies"?
-Yep.

31:57.709 --> 32:00.045
He also asked
if they wanted to take a ride with him.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.129
Uh-huh.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.298
Yeah, well, they said the van…

32:04.800 --> 32:06.343
the van's gray?

32:06.426 --> 32:08.470
Yep, they got a plate.

32:08.554 --> 32:10.639
-They got what?
-Indiana plate number.

32:11.306 --> 32:13.392
Check the notes at the end of the report.

32:14.142 --> 32:16.687
Okay. Did you run it?

32:16.770 --> 32:20.190
No. The guy drove off.
They never saw him again.

32:20.274 --> 32:22.651
And the girl struck me as
a little dramatic.

32:22.734 --> 32:24.069
You know girls, man.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.696
But be my guest, Brian.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.698
Okay. Thanks, Len.

32:32.995 --> 32:36.290
That van that followed
the two girls in Whittier,

32:36.790 --> 32:39.501
it's been called in three other times
in the last year.

32:41.003 --> 32:45.757
Once in Indianola, once in Olivet,
once near the Dauphin Reserve.

32:45.841 --> 32:48.677
The same complaint every time. Harassment.

32:50.679 --> 32:52.472
And said van is registered to--

32:52.556 --> 32:56.393
Larry D. Hall. Wabash, Indiana.

32:58.353 --> 33:00.939
Your sister told me
your mother actually visited.

33:01.023 --> 33:04.276
She did. She's pissed you brought
your girlfriend to my sentencing.

33:04.359 --> 33:07.154
I've been with Sammy
longer than I was with your mother.

33:07.237 --> 33:09.323
She's pissed Sammy makes me happy.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.700
I just wish you liked her more.

33:11.783 --> 33:14.494
Sam? I like her fine.
She just ain't my mother.

33:15.454 --> 33:16.622
Uh-huh.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.588
I've been thinking about that deal.

33:24.671 --> 33:27.257
What? You think this place is bad?

33:27.966 --> 33:31.345
Springfield is the kind of prison
that they send subhumans to.

33:31.428 --> 33:33.805
The fucking freaks with no souls.

33:33.889 --> 33:35.766
Lifers with nothing to lose.

33:35.849 --> 33:38.143
They'll commute my whole sentence.

33:38.227 --> 33:40.854
What happens if you don't get them
what they want?

33:41.563 --> 33:42.981
Then what?

33:43.065 --> 33:44.608
What happens
if you have to defend yourself,

33:44.691 --> 33:47.361
and they tack on another ten fucking years
to your sentence?

33:48.028 --> 33:49.863
That'd be a death sentence.

33:49.947 --> 33:52.157
We'll find a way.
We'll figure something out.

33:52.241 --> 33:53.951
-How?
-I don't know.

33:55.202 --> 33:56.745
But we're going to find a way.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.114
You've got a call from Wabash PD.

34:32.197 --> 34:35.449
Yeah? Put it through, please.

34:37.494 --> 34:40.289
Detective Miller? Chris Drysdale.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.873
Hey, Chris.

34:41.956 --> 34:44.668
Got a question about a van

34:44.751 --> 34:50.924
registered to a resident of yours,
a Lawrence D. Hall?

34:51.007 --> 34:52.467
Sure. Larry.

34:52.551 --> 34:53.552
You know him?

34:54.136 --> 34:55.469
I grew up with him.

34:56.096 --> 34:57.556
You know him well?

34:57.639 --> 34:59.933
Well enough. It's a small town.

35:00.517 --> 35:02.352
You looking at him for something?

35:02.436 --> 35:08.692
Well, we're just trying to figure out
why a van registered to him

35:10.277 --> 35:13.488
passed through our area
a couple of times in the last year.

35:13.572 --> 35:16.074
You're in Illinois, the girl said.

35:16.158 --> 35:18.744
Georgetown, about 130 miles down the road.

35:19.453 --> 35:21.622
So, he wasn't picking up a gallon of milk.

35:21.705 --> 35:22.831
Nope.

35:22.915 --> 35:24.791
Or doing Civil War shit?

35:25.375 --> 35:26.376
What's that?

35:26.460 --> 35:32.216
Larry's into Civil War reenactments.
You know, they dress up in the uniforms.

35:32.299 --> 35:35.219
Larry has these funky muttonchop
sideburns, and they play at the battles.

35:35.302 --> 35:37.054
They do it all over the place.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.932
You should check if they had any
at the times he was around your town.

35:40.015 --> 35:41.475
I bet that will explain it.

35:42.351 --> 35:43.393
Okay.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.230
Thank you, Chris. I'll look into it.

35:46.313 --> 35:47.648
Yeah, sure enough. Take care.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.978
Vermilion County Parks Department.

37:50.062 --> 37:53.106
Hey, this is Brian Miller
over at the Sheriff's Department,

37:53.190 --> 37:54.983
trying to ascertain whether or not

37:55.651 --> 38:01.448
any Civil War reenactors
have filed for permits in the last year?

38:02.908 --> 38:04.952
That could take a bit. Can you wait?

38:05.035 --> 38:06.703
Yes, ma'am, I can. Thank you.

38:06.787 --> 38:07.829
Okay, hold on.

38:13.502 --> 38:16.547
Okay. Are you still there?

38:16.630 --> 38:17.631
Yes, ma'am.

38:18.131 --> 38:20.884
Sorry, we have no record
of a Civil War reenactment

38:20.968 --> 38:23.011
over the last three years.

38:23.095 --> 38:24.346
Okay.

38:24.888 --> 38:27.140
Well, thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.

38:27.224 --> 38:29.518
However, there was a Revolutionary War.

38:30.769 --> 38:31.770
What is that?

38:31.854 --> 38:35.607
I said there was
a Revolutionary War reenactment though.

38:35.691 --> 38:36.692
When?

38:36.775 --> 38:38.944
Last summer, Forest Glen Park.

38:39.695 --> 38:41.488
The exact date was,

38:41.572 --> 38:44.116
let me see, July 19th.

38:46.827 --> 38:47.870
Hello?

38:48.662 --> 38:50.038
Hello, are you still there?

38:52.416 --> 38:53.458
Detective?

38:54.459 --> 38:56.086
Okay. Thank you.

39:06.597 --> 39:07.764
Sammy?

39:12.436 --> 39:13.729
Great.

39:23.572 --> 39:24.823
Where's Dad?

39:27.784 --> 39:32.581
He came in from the yard last week
talking funny, you know,

39:32.664 --> 39:34.499
like he was drunk, but he wasn't.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.794
He said that he had a headache.

39:37.878 --> 39:39.254
You know, he--

39:39.338 --> 39:41.757
He went to sit down,
but he missed the chair.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.301
And the side of his face went all droopy--

39:44.384 --> 39:45.719
-He had a stroke?
-Yeah.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.846
-Is he alive?
-Yeah. He's alive.

39:47.930 --> 39:50.349
He was in the hospital for a few days,
but now he's out.

39:50.432 --> 39:51.558
Is he okay?

39:54.228 --> 39:55.771
Is he okay?

39:55.854 --> 39:57.147
Told me to say he was…

39:59.399 --> 40:00.567
but he's not.

40:01.735 --> 40:05.948
He can't talk all the way right,
and he walks kinda to the side.

40:06.031 --> 40:08.700
He's really weak, and he tires.

40:08.784 --> 40:12.371
He's not good at all, no.

40:14.164 --> 40:15.290
When did it happen?

40:17.292 --> 40:19.545
Last week. Wednesday.

40:19.628 --> 40:21.630
-Why didn't anybody tell me?
-I am telling you.

40:21.713 --> 40:24.132
Before. Someone should have called me.
I'm his son.

40:24.675 --> 40:27.302
Well, he is like a baby right now.

40:27.886 --> 40:31.431
I had to have my sister drive two hours
to watch him so I could come and tell you.

40:31.515 --> 40:33.100
What do you want? A fucking parade?

40:36.186 --> 40:40.566
You know, the doctor said
it was stress that did it.

40:42.651 --> 40:45.821
Know what caused that stress?
You. In here.

40:46.864 --> 40:49.575
It is all he ever fucking talks about.

40:49.658 --> 40:53.120
His poor Jimmy doing time
because he was a bad father.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.331
He was a bad father. Didn't do his job.

40:56.415 --> 40:58.458
Well, listen to me. He did his job.

40:59.126 --> 41:00.878
Nobody made you sell that shit.

41:01.378 --> 41:02.963
Nobody put a gun to your head.

41:03.505 --> 41:06.049
And now you're in here,
and it is killing him.

41:16.393 --> 41:17.394
You through?

41:19.313 --> 41:23.817
He told me you got some way of getting out
of here earlier than the ten years.

41:26.570 --> 41:28.238
He don't got ten years.

41:29.281 --> 41:33.827
And if you stay in here,
he don't got three.

42:15.494 --> 42:19.790
Detective Drysdale, this is Brian Miller
from Georgetown again.

42:19.873 --> 42:20.999
Hey, Brian.

42:21.959 --> 42:26.004
Yeah, well, that Civil War tip you gave us
really paid off. Thank you for that.

42:26.797 --> 42:28.632
You said you grew up with Larry.

42:28.715 --> 42:30.884
Well, what's he like?

42:30.968 --> 42:32.678
A harmless weirdo.

42:35.138 --> 42:38.016
Sorry, I got "harmless."

42:38.100 --> 42:41.061
I said, he's a harmless weirdo.

42:41.562 --> 42:43.522
Uh-huh. Why weirdo?

42:43.605 --> 42:46.942
Well, the sideburns, like I said.

42:47.025 --> 42:50.904
He grew up
with a mom and dad who were odd.

42:50.988 --> 42:53.740
And the cemetery, you know.

42:54.491 --> 42:55.659
The cemetery?

42:57.911 --> 42:58.912
A what?

42:58.996 --> 43:02.040
A gravedigger.
Larry grew up on a graveyard.

43:02.541 --> 43:03.834
But he's harmless.

43:03.917 --> 43:05.127
Why would you say that?

43:05.627 --> 43:07.713
He just is. He's a twerpy kinda guy.

43:07.796 --> 43:09.464
He got beat up a bunch in school.

43:09.548 --> 43:10.549
Uh-huh.

43:11.175 --> 43:13.677
The thing is,
there's a girl that went missing--

43:13.760 --> 43:14.803
The college girl?

43:15.762 --> 43:18.056
He confessed to that, but he didn't do it.

43:19.183 --> 43:20.517
Marion PD cleared him.

43:20.601 --> 43:23.395
Said he was a serial confessor.

43:23.896 --> 43:25.522
But no, I--

43:28.233 --> 43:30.903
He confessed in a missing persons case?

43:30.986 --> 43:32.946
In Marion, yeah.

43:33.030 --> 43:35.449
They ascertained he was full of shit.
That--

43:35.532 --> 43:38.952
But that's Larry. He's always trying
to make himself look bigger than he is.

43:40.287 --> 43:42.289
Let me call you from my landline.

45:03.662 --> 45:04.663
Hey.

45:04.746 --> 45:05.747
I'm back.

45:05.831 --> 45:09.751
Yeah. So, Chris, the thing is,

45:10.627 --> 45:14.965
we got a girl, went missing,
turned up dead.

45:15.799 --> 45:18.760
And you think Larry Hall
could have something to do with it?

45:19.261 --> 45:20.387
Well, we don't know.

45:20.929 --> 45:25.851
What we do know is a van was seen
driving around the area

45:25.934 --> 45:30.898
and, you know, he was creeping out girls
in the area on more than one occasion.

45:30.981 --> 45:33.942
So, with your help,
we'd like to talk to him.

45:38.238 --> 45:39.698
Well, I mean…

45:42.201 --> 45:43.911
I have to disagree with you here.

45:46.830 --> 45:48.332
On which part?

45:48.415 --> 45:51.877
Where Larry Hall could have
anything to do with a dead girl.

45:53.921 --> 45:55.506
He just likes to talk.

45:56.507 --> 45:57.674
Like in Marion.

45:57.758 --> 46:01.512
They got the guy who did it,
and it sure wasn't Larry.

46:05.224 --> 46:06.308
Fair enough.

46:10.354 --> 46:13.815
I'll call him in here,
and I'll get us a room.

46:13.899 --> 46:15.108
I'll set it up.

46:17.110 --> 46:19.321
10:00 tomorrow work for you?

46:20.072 --> 46:22.699
Yes. Sure. Yes.

46:22.783 --> 46:24.743
You think you can get him there
without a hitch?

46:24.826 --> 46:26.411
If I can't, I'll call you.

46:26.495 --> 46:27.955
Else, I'll see you at 10:00.

46:36.588 --> 46:37.589
Okay.

46:44.346 --> 46:46.306
-I said, okay.
-I heard the word.

46:47.724 --> 46:48.976
Why don't you elaborate?

46:51.770 --> 46:53.355
I'll accept the transfer

46:54.481 --> 46:58.235
and befriend this sick fucking puppy
and get you what you want.

46:59.236 --> 47:00.612
So, let's get to it.

47:03.490 --> 47:05.576
I'm glad you've made yourself available.

47:07.286 --> 47:09.454
But I never said the job was yours.

47:11.164 --> 47:12.791
I asked if you were interested.

47:13.292 --> 47:14.835
-Now I know you are.
-Wait a second.

47:14.918 --> 47:17.671
We're looking at more than one applicant
for the position.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.175
Fuck are you talking about?

47:21.258 --> 47:22.593
I just told you.

47:25.637 --> 47:28.140
I'll let my bosses know
you're amenable to a transfer

47:28.640 --> 47:32.311
and put your name in the hat for the job.

47:32.394 --> 47:33.604
And we'll go from there.

47:39.860 --> 47:41.195
Keep doing your homework.

47:41.945 --> 47:44.531
You're not going to want to blow
the job interview, believe me.

48:27.616 --> 48:31.411
Hi. Detective Miller.
I have a 10:00 a.m. with Drysdale.

48:31.495 --> 48:33.872
-Brian?
-Chris!

48:33.956 --> 48:35.541
Hey, it's good to meet you.

48:35.624 --> 48:36.667
Likewise.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.544
-He in a box?
-Larry?

48:38.627 --> 48:40.045
No, he's across the street.

48:40.128 --> 48:42.464
We got him in a conference room
with the Marion guys.

48:43.131 --> 48:44.383
The detectives?

48:44.466 --> 48:46.552
Yeah. They want to question him
on the Reitler case.

48:47.845 --> 48:49.179
We wanted to observe.

48:49.263 --> 48:51.557
But I was hoping that he would be at ease.

48:52.307 --> 48:53.725
Not think anything was up.

48:53.809 --> 48:57.062
Well, he spent a whole day
with the Marion guys once, driving around.

48:57.145 --> 48:58.522
He's pretty relaxed with them.

48:59.606 --> 49:01.066
Why were they driving around?

49:01.567 --> 49:03.986
He claimed he could take them to a body.
Patricia Reitler's.

49:04.069 --> 49:06.071
-But he didn't, because, like I said--
-Yeah, no.

49:06.154 --> 49:07.573
He's "full of shit." I know.

49:12.703 --> 49:16.540
Detective Russ Aborn, Brian Miller,
with the Vermilion Sheriffs.

49:16.623 --> 49:17.624
Hey.

49:17.708 --> 49:19.960
Derek's in with him now,
shooting the shit.

49:20.669 --> 49:23.589
I know you like him
for some dead girl in your town,

49:23.672 --> 49:26.758
but we wasted a day with this guy
on the Reitler case.

49:26.842 --> 49:30.345
And he dragged us all around,
one cornfield to the next,

49:30.429 --> 49:32.598
and he didn't do it.

49:32.681 --> 49:35.100
So, I doubt he did yours.

49:35.184 --> 49:38.228
He just likes confessing to cops.

49:40.689 --> 49:41.857
Good to know.

49:52.242 --> 49:53.327
Derek Johansen.

49:54.620 --> 49:58.498
Now, those are some exquisite burnsides.

49:59.625 --> 50:02.878
Named after General Ambrose Burnside,

50:03.462 --> 50:05.797
a civil war general
from around these parts, right?

50:05.881 --> 50:11.136
A lot of people call them sideburns,
but the proper term is burnsides, yeah.

50:11.220 --> 50:14.056
Well, yours are impressive,
no matter what they're called.

50:14.556 --> 50:16.225
You leave them in place year-round?

50:16.725 --> 50:21.188
Yeah, it's easier than having to regrow
them before every reenactment.

50:22.064 --> 50:25.609
You do both the Civil War
and Revolutionary War reenactments, right?

50:26.568 --> 50:29.571
Sorry, I'm Brian.

50:29.655 --> 50:33.116
I'm with the Vermilion County Sheriffs
in Georgetown.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.243
Indiana?

50:34.326 --> 50:35.369
Illinois.

50:38.205 --> 50:39.373
Never heard of it.

50:42.334 --> 50:45.587
We had a Revolutionary War reenactment.

50:45.671 --> 50:49.883
I guess it was one town over.
The same county.

50:50.968 --> 50:55.681
You didn't attend a Revolutionary War
reenactment in Illinois last summer?

50:59.726 --> 51:01.979
I don't know, maybe.

51:02.771 --> 51:06.942
Well, yeah, he did a lot of this
when he was leading us to Tricia Reitler.

51:07.025 --> 51:08.944
"I don't know, maybe."

51:09.695 --> 51:10.863
Didn't you, Larry?

51:12.823 --> 51:15.117
C'mon, tell him, Larry.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.494
Tell him how you, I don't know, maybe.

51:17.578 --> 51:19.371
And, I can't quite remember--

51:19.454 --> 51:21.415
If you want to question Mr. Hall
in your case,

51:21.498 --> 51:23.083
why don't you go ahead and arrange a time.

51:23.166 --> 51:25.127
Right now,
I'd like to chat with him about mine.

51:28.463 --> 51:30.507
By all means, chat.

51:33.927 --> 51:38.557
All right, Larry,
this is Georgetown right here, okay?

51:38.640 --> 51:43.353
And this is Forest Glen Park.

51:49.359 --> 51:50.360
And…

51:51.153 --> 51:53.030
McHenry Township, right up here.

51:53.113 --> 51:56.283
And this would have been
where the reenactment take place.

51:56.366 --> 51:58.035
McHenry. Yeah, I've been there.

51:58.869 --> 51:59.870
Last summer?

52:00.913 --> 52:04.416
I mean,
I think so, yeah. Like around there.

52:05.501 --> 52:07.169
I know that there's a Hardee's--

52:08.295 --> 52:09.296
Sorry.

52:10.380 --> 52:11.381
No, it's okay.

52:14.301 --> 52:17.137
I remember there was a Hardee's
right around here.

52:17.221 --> 52:19.640
That's right. They do, Larry.
It's right here.

52:19.723 --> 52:24.353
Yep.
I had a sandwich and some french fries

52:24.436 --> 52:29.399
when I was driving around
trying to find a guy who had a Charger.

52:30.275 --> 52:31.735
A Dodge?

52:32.236 --> 52:39.117
Yeah. I have a '82 Dodge van,
and some of the parts are interchangeable.

52:40.494 --> 52:41.995
Did you ever find the guy?

52:44.998 --> 52:47.084
No, I don't think that I did.

52:48.001 --> 52:51.088
-But you drove around looking?
-Yep.

52:51.171 --> 52:55.759
Larry loves Dodges. Heard all about them
that day we drove him around.

52:55.843 --> 52:58.136
Yeah, well, I like Mopar parts.

52:58.804 --> 53:03.809
I'll find these little junkers
that are rusted underneath a tree

53:03.892 --> 53:06.812
or behind some of these people's houses.

53:07.646 --> 53:08.981
They're not doing nothing with them.

53:09.064 --> 53:12.401
So… maybe I know a body shop

53:12.484 --> 53:17.573
that… needs a tailpipe

53:17.656 --> 53:20.659
or… filter housing,

53:20.742 --> 53:24.663
and then I'll just buy it for 20
and resell it for 35.

53:26.039 --> 53:27.583
Must be a lot of driving around.

53:27.666 --> 53:29.001
Oh, yeah. A lot of miles.

53:29.084 --> 53:30.294
But I like to drive.

53:32.171 --> 53:35.966
And when you were driving around,
do you remember talking to two girls?

53:42.139 --> 53:45.934
I asked for directions.
They were very rude.

53:46.018 --> 53:47.269
How were they rude?

53:51.398 --> 53:54.526
They told me to--

53:57.362 --> 53:58.572
Sorry, what?

53:59.281 --> 54:01.783
Told me to go fuck myself.

54:02.367 --> 54:04.161
Did you exchange words with them?

54:04.244 --> 54:06.121
I did. It was all in fun.

54:06.747 --> 54:09.666
Like the misunderstanding
with the jogger, Larry?

54:09.750 --> 54:11.001
Yeah.

54:11.084 --> 54:12.669
-Yeah.
-Misunderstanding?

54:12.753 --> 54:15.339
Larry had some words with
a jogger in town a few times.

54:15.422 --> 54:17.049
She accused him of stalking her.

54:17.132 --> 54:19.176
I didn't stalk anyone.

54:19.259 --> 54:21.261
Yeah, I can't help it if I drive home

54:21.345 --> 54:25.682
past where some girl runs
the same time every day. I mean--

54:25.766 --> 54:28.352
Come on, Larry.
Was a little more to it than that.

54:28.435 --> 54:29.686
And she smiled at me.

54:29.770 --> 54:31.730
-She smiled at you?
-Yeah.

54:32.606 --> 54:34.358
Abby, the--

54:34.441 --> 54:35.692
The jogger.

54:36.193 --> 54:37.361
And you know her name?

54:38.195 --> 54:39.905
Yeah, it's a small town.

54:44.785 --> 54:47.246
Larry, these two girls in my town--

54:47.329 --> 54:49.206
You know,
I was just goofing around with them.

54:49.289 --> 54:51.124
If they said that there was more to it,

54:51.208 --> 54:53.335
then they just didn't get the joke,
I'm sorry.

54:53.418 --> 54:56.171
I would never dream of hurting two girls.

54:56.255 --> 54:57.923
Well, you might dream of it.

55:01.760 --> 55:04.137
All right.
What are you guys talking about?

55:05.848 --> 55:07.975
Larry has vivid dreams.

55:09.059 --> 55:11.687
Tell Brian here about your dreams, Larry.

55:15.941 --> 55:17.693
They're just dreams.

55:18.986 --> 55:20.320
Just tell me about 'em.

55:24.700 --> 55:26.243
In my dreams, I--

55:29.162 --> 55:35.252
In my dreams,
I, like… kill women… you know?

55:39.840 --> 55:40.841
Sure.

55:42.050 --> 55:43.719
They're just dreams.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.767
Tell me more.
