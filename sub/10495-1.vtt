01:05.098 --> 01:08.033
Of course you can kiss me.

01:26.319 --> 01:27.684
Of course you can kiss me.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.821
Of course you can kiss me.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.920
You can kiss me.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.225
-ldentification, please.
-Hi. Grant Hillman.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.919
-That's H-l--
-Just the lD, please.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.999
l'm here to pick up....

02:51.871 --> 02:53.600
Okay.

02:53.773 --> 02:56.867
-Grant Hillman picking up Liberty.
-He's clear.

02:57.477 --> 03:01.379
lt's not often you come here for a date.
Maybe when Clinton was in office.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.846
Would you please get out the car?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.678
That was a joke.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.587
Seriously, how many guns
are pointed at me right now?

03:11.224 --> 03:13.317
l'll need those flowers too.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.698
Hi, Grant.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.539
Thank you, Mark.

03:39.219 --> 03:44.452
These were for you.
They would have impressed you.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.889
No, no, no. They still do.
They died for their country.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.495
-Do you wanna get out of here?
-More than you know.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.739
Alone at last.

04:39.345 --> 04:45.409
<i>All agents are in position. lf possible,</i>
<i>can you walk me out a latte? lced, soy.</i>

04:47.086 --> 04:51.079
l am so glad you finally asked me out.
lt wasn't that hard, was it?

04:51.257 --> 04:53.782
Come on, l'm easy. l'm--

04:53.960 --> 04:56.428
Okay, l'm not really easy, but--

04:56.596 --> 04:59.292
l'll shut up, because
l don't know what l'm saying.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.056
l have wanted to ask you out
for a long time.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.661
-But l was a little intimidated.
-Because of my father?

05:05.838 --> 05:09.137
No, because you're easy.
l'm just going off what you said.

05:09.509 --> 05:12.307
<i>Looks like Liberty found herself</i>
<i>a good one this time.</i>

05:12.645 --> 05:15.170
l hate first dates. Too painful.

05:15.348 --> 05:19.910
-For you or the girl?
-All l want is to love and be loved, Morales.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.890
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.859
Would you like to take a picture?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.494
-That would be great.
-Okay. Come here.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.995
-Go.
-You can stand here.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.829
We're visiting from Florida.
l voted for your father.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.903
My husband didn't,
but we split up...

05:39.405 --> 05:42.841
...but not because of that!
There were other things too.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.978
But l got the girls!
Lilly, get over there.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.340
Come here. Here we go. Stand here.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.212
Thanks.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.651
-Oh, that's great. Thank you.
-You're so welcome.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.656
-Girls. Come on.
-Have fun. Enjoy Washington.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.556
Thank you.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.231
-ls that Anna Foster?
-How can you stand to have people...

06:08.401 --> 06:11.928
-...staring at you all the time?
-lt's part of the job description.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.073
After six years in the White House...

06:14.240 --> 06:18.301
...and eight as the governor's daughter,
l don't really know anything else.

06:18.478 --> 06:22.278
l think you'd get all this attention
if you weren't the first daughter.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.146
Yeah.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.719
You look good in that blouse.
You should wear that more often.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.155
<i>Actually, it's a sweater.</i>

06:34.394 --> 06:37.557
Sweater, blouse, you wear it well.
Take a compliment.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.123
-Have you heard from Rhode lsland?
-l got in.

06:42.301 --> 06:46.101
-Congratulations. l knew you would.
-My parents are pushing premed.

06:46.272 --> 06:51.437
l think parents want you to appreciate
the good things in life, but not do them.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.739
-They want you to see art....
-We got something at 9:00.

06:54.914 --> 06:58.907
--but not make art. They want you
to have love, find love and value love...

06:59.085 --> 07:00.985
...but not make love, ever.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.622
Thought l'd make this night
more memorable.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.417
He's reaching. Go!

07:05.858 --> 07:08.793
-What are you guys doing?
-Wait, these are my friends.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.521
-You don't know what you're doing!
-Get off me!

07:16.669 --> 07:18.261
This street is off-limits.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.735
lt's only a camera.

07:19.906 --> 07:22.170
<i>Okay, folks, it's over.</i>
<i>Clear the street.</i>

07:22.341 --> 07:25.208
-l'm so sorry.
-l should wait for them.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.142
No, come on, it's still early.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.942
We could go catch a movie or something.

07:32.518 --> 07:33.849
Anna...

07:35.321 --> 07:36.982
...you are really great.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.515
But this is just way
too out of control for me.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.052
l'm sorry.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.133
Of course you can kiss me.

07:57.510 --> 08:01.537
Weiss to Control.
Returning home with Liberty.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.391
Good night.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.330
-Poor kid.
-All right, well, at least she's home safe.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.472
How about l get you home safe?

08:26.639 --> 08:30.370
-How about l call you when l get there?
-Sure.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.107
-You're not gonna call me, are you?
-No.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.412
lt's out of my way, anyway!

08:58.604 --> 09:00.868
-How was the date?
-l need to talk to him.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.100
-l can't let you in there, Anna.
-Anna, wait.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.102
-Go on.
-l'm not going.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.846
Dad.

09:11.817 --> 09:16.117
Way to go. l can't believe
you had that restaurant swarming...

09:16.289 --> 09:18.951
...with your secret servants.
You ruined my date!

09:19.125 --> 09:22.117
And now l'm gonna die
before l ever get to third base.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.825
l mean second base.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.874
Anna?

09:39.045 --> 09:43.072
-Talk to you about this later.
-No. No, stay.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.844
Pull up a chair. We're just discussing
the G8 Summit in Prague.

09:47.019 --> 09:50.750
How to persuade the EU to adopt our plan
to give humanitarian aid...

09:50.923 --> 09:53.414
...and medical technology
to developing nations.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.891
But you had a bad date...

09:56.062 --> 10:00.931
-...so we should probably focus on that.
-No, l'm so sorry to have interrupted.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.965
Excuse me.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.101
So third base is what again?

10:10.376 --> 10:13.675
-l always thought it was below the waist.
-l don't remember, sir.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.711
Maybe that was just cheerleaders.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.479
Glad l asked.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.259
Anna...

10:28.427 --> 10:31.555
...l know that dating is
a little more difficult for you.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.528
Try ''impossible.''

10:33.699 --> 10:36.463
And you know that
the extra security is necessary.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.737
They ruined her date.
She really likes this boy.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.768
Oh, okay.

10:42.942 --> 10:46.469
A boy who ranks 24th in his class,
plays Xbox two hours a day...

10:46.646 --> 10:49.672
-...and wants to go to art school.
-Who told you that?

10:49.849 --> 10:51.817
-Phil.
-Okay, l don't want some guy...

10:51.984 --> 10:55.249
...who wears his sunglasses
inside at night-- Sorry, Phil.

10:55.421 --> 10:59.517
Listening in on my dinner dates.
That is such a total abuse of power.

10:59.692 --> 11:04.061
l am 1 8 years old and l wanna go out
on a date without guys in bad suits--

11:04.230 --> 11:09.167
Sorry, Harper. Hiding behind every tree.
Nothing is private.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.701
Sweetie, l am just trying to protect you.

11:11.871 --> 11:17.400
Dad, l'm not that 1 2-year-old girl who would
only dance with you at your inaugural ball.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.346
You're right.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.574
Excuse me, sir.
lt's the vice president on the phone.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.475
He says it's urgent.

11:28.554 --> 11:31.682
Dad. You can make it up to me
when we're in Prague.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.886
We'll see.

11:35.061 --> 11:38.292
-Remember Gabrielle Le Clerc?
-French ambassador's daughter.

11:38.464 --> 11:42.594
She'll be in Prague and she's invited
me to this concert. And l wanna go.

11:42.768 --> 11:47.068
Yes, Gabrielle. Pierre's little girl.
lt's all right, l suppose.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.730
Without the army. One agent.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.704
Thank you, Mom. Yeah, one agent.

11:52.878 --> 11:57.713
-Two. Weiss and Morales. Final offer.
-Just Weiss and Morales, promise?

11:57.883 --> 12:02.479
-Never ask a president to promise, honey.
-l'm not. l'm asking my dad.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.486
Promise?

12:04.924 --> 12:06.289
Promise.

12:08.794 --> 12:13.060
Later, maybe we can talk about me leaving
Prague to go to the Berlin Love Parade.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.393
-Forget it.
-l've been reading about it...

12:15.568 --> 12:19.334
-...and it's basically one big peace rally.
-No, it's basically an orgy.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.997
Not if l keep my top on
and l go like this a lot:

12:23.409 --> 12:26.276
lt's not going to happen, Anna.

12:26.979 --> 12:31.473
-The answer's no.
-Sir, vice president. Still waiting.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.579
President. Still president.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.359
-Z-Y-G-O-T-E.
-Very good.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.328
Z ygote.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.195
Ten, 20, 40 points.

12:49.368 --> 12:52.997
Okay. ln Prague, l will fulfill
all my diplomatic obligations.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.164
l'll go to the reception,
the concert with Gabrielle...

12:56.342 --> 13:00.802
...where l will be escorted by two agents,
stay out as late as l want.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.847
Next day, l'll have every moment
accounted for again.

13:04.016 --> 13:07.247
Two days later, l go to the Love Parade,
meet you in Prague...

13:07.419 --> 13:09.683
...go to college, love you, fantastic plan.

13:09.855 --> 13:14.656
Take out the Love Parade,
you got yourself a deal. H-A-T.

13:14.827 --> 13:18.058
Hat. Eight points.

13:18.397 --> 13:19.659
Damn.

13:19.832 --> 13:24.963
Dad, l'm 1 8, and if you let me go
to the Love Parade, maybe l'll vote for you.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.937
-You are a very funny child.
-Mom.

13:29.108 --> 13:35.206
Q-U-l-V-E-R-S.

13:35.381 --> 13:39.317
That is a triple-word score
with a seven-letter bonus...

13:39.485 --> 13:41.646
...makes 1 44 points.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.082
-Damn.
-Damn.

14:07.546 --> 14:10.572
<i>lt's been busy</i>
<i>for America's first family in Prague...</i>

14:10.749 --> 14:12.683
<i>...during this G8 Summit week.</i>

14:12.852 --> 14:18.085
<i>First daughter Anna Foster took a carriage</i>
<i>ride with the mayor of Prague and his wife.</i>

14:18.257 --> 14:21.715
<i>After a press conference,</i>
<i>a tour of the Air Force Museum...</i>

14:21.894 --> 14:26.854
<i>...with the minister of culture,</i>
<i>then a caricature on Charles Bridge...</i>

14:27.032 --> 14:30.092
<i>...a photo op with high school students</i>
<i>at Prague Castle...</i>

14:30.269 --> 14:34.638
<i>...and even a few moments entertaining</i>
<i>children at the Prague Marionette Theater.</i>

14:34.807 --> 14:37.275
<i>lt seems Anna Foster's</i>
<i>diplomatic skills...</i>

14:37.443 --> 14:41.004
<i>...are on the way to matching</i>
<i>those of her father, President Foster.</i>

14:41.180 --> 14:46.015
<i>The day ended with a presidential</i>
<i>banquet at the National Museum.</i>

14:56.262 --> 14:58.196
Anna.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.633
-Gabrielle! How are you?
-Good.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.734
-Gabrielle?
-l'm sorry l am late...

15:03.903 --> 15:06.667
...but the guards outside
took turns to search me.

15:07.039 --> 15:11.840
-Gabrielle, you're all grown up.
-lt happens.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.549
-What's that in your mouth, candy?
-No, it's pierced.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.588
-You like it?
-No.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.995
Remind me to commission
a study and find out...

15:31.163 --> 15:33.961
...why on Earth anyone wants
to pierce their tongue.

15:34.133 --> 15:38.627
l'll save your country's money.
See, some guys think it makes for better--

15:38.904 --> 15:42.237
Gabrielle, let's go mingle over here.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.109
She's a nice girl.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.872
-Wonder what else she has pierced.
-Oh, relax, Jim.

15:49.048 --> 15:53.985
-How should l relax?
-Set up an embargo. You love those.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.815
Have you been smoking?

15:56.989 --> 16:01.016
l had a cigar with the prime minister.
lt's rude if you don't.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.460
l love champagne.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.261
Yes, and 1 8 is okay in Europe, so....

16:11.971 --> 16:16.067
l don't believe they're still following you.
Go away, men with guns.

16:18.077 --> 16:21.274
lt's no good. l've tried.
Even in English, they don't get it.

16:21.447 --> 16:26.214
l don't know how you stand it. l got rid
of my babysitters when l was, like, 1 4.

16:26.385 --> 16:31.220
Yeah, l'm afraid it doesn't work
like that in the ''land of the free.''

16:31.390 --> 16:33.187
Cheers.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.361
What?

16:55.614 --> 16:59.778
Thank God Gabrielle found another
trashy friend to hang out with.

16:59.952 --> 17:03.615
Yes. Your daughter.

17:05.790 --> 17:10.353
Bye, Mom. And thank you
so much again, Dad. Bye.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.861
See? He loved the hair.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.425
Little change in plans, Mr. President?

17:16.602 --> 17:20.060
Oh, you two have been
with me a long time.

17:22.473 --> 17:26.308
We spend the day at the Love Parade
and then we go to my friend's club.

17:26.478 --> 17:29.504
lt's the hottest place in the whole city.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.615
That's okay.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.981
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.884
What a great idea, to change my hair.
lt's perfect.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.821
-Yes, l told you.
-No one knows who l am.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.055
-You get jet lag, Morales?
-No.

17:44.229 --> 17:48.325
-Really? l get it awful.
-l take herbs.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.024
-Herbs?
-Yep.

17:50.202 --> 17:53.729
-Really? Why?
-They help reset your clock.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.602
l'd like to reset your clock.

17:57.376 --> 17:58.775
l'm just saying.

17:59.211 --> 18:05.047
-Gabby, l am so excited. l feel so free.
-You're going to love it.

18:05.217 --> 18:08.311
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Excuse me.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.785
-Anna, come on.
-lt's okay.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.183
There's plenty more inside.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.865
Gabby, you are so right.
There are lots of cute guys here.

18:23.035 --> 18:28.496
Oh, and wait till the Berlin Love Parade.
500,000 cute guys.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.871
-Sounds like so much fun. l can't wait.
-lt's gonna be crazy.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.741
Here we are.

19:24.429 --> 19:27.421
Hey, yo. Break it down.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.400
Break it down for me.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.059
Spread your wings,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:32.237 --> 19:37.470
You are now rocking with the best,
hard-working, revolution sure-shot.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.019
What?

19:59.765 --> 20:01.062
No.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.230
No! No way!

20:06.939 --> 20:08.736
No way! He said just two of you.

20:09.308 --> 20:13.904
-No, that's just security--
-Don't worry about it. They're local guys.

20:15.347 --> 20:18.077
Liberty's heading out to the bathroom.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.713
Got her.

20:32.464 --> 20:35.490
l can't believe he did it again.

20:35.667 --> 20:39.330
He completely broke his promise.
Don't l deserve one night of freedom?

20:39.504 --> 20:42.905
l'm not even talking freedom.
Two agents.

20:46.478 --> 20:49.242
Oh, my God, Anna. l have a great plan.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.748
Don't look back. Don't look back.

20:57.923 --> 21:02.087
-l'm saying-- Anna?
-Anna! Anna!

21:03.962 --> 21:08.194
-Secure the perimeters. Liberty's AWOL.
-Anna, run!

21:13.705 --> 21:16.503
Anna! Anna!

21:21.213 --> 21:23.044
Oh, God.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.281
Excuse me.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.817
-Sir, excuse me.
-You all right?

21:29.421 --> 21:31.855
Could you please help me get out of here?

21:34.393 --> 21:35.826
-Yeah, why not?
-Thank you.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.791
Stop!

21:39.331 --> 21:40.730
-Get them!
-Go, go, go.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.499
Go!

21:50.976 --> 21:53.467
Oh, my God. l can't believe l just did that.

22:02.487 --> 22:06.355
l'm on fire! l'm untouchable!
l'm Anna. Who are you?

22:06.525 --> 22:08.789
Ben Calder. Freelance getaway man.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.985
Yeah, need the hand. Need the hand.

22:22.374 --> 22:27.437
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much, Mr. Ben.

22:27.612 --> 22:31.708
You're welcome. l think. Depending on
what crime l've just aided and abetted.

22:31.883 --> 22:34.977
No. No, no crime. l don't think.

22:35.153 --> 22:38.145
Thank you again, very much. Thanks.

22:38.323 --> 22:42.487
Anna? Do you have a last name?

22:43.895 --> 22:48.127
No, actually, it's just-- lt's Anna. Like Pink.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.234
Thank you again.

22:51.103 --> 22:55.335
Actually, l need another ride, if that's okay.
Very fast. Like, right now.

22:55.507 --> 22:59.375
Whatever you say, Mrs. Bond.

23:05.584 --> 23:08.075
They're chasing us! They're chasing us!

23:15.427 --> 23:17.224
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.943
Ben, l think we just lost them.

23:38.116 --> 23:40.346
Oh, we lost them, did we?

23:40.519 --> 23:44.250
-So why the wild ride, Anna?
-Concert security.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.085
l snuck in, they caught me.
Chaos erupted.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.660
Yeah, because they always give
giant chase vehicles to bouncers.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.992
Maybe there was a little bit more
involved than just that.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.795
-Almost always is, isn't there?
-Yeah.

24:03.909 --> 24:06.343
Well, l'm gonna go.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.510
So....

24:08.847 --> 24:12.112
Thank you so much for the ride, Ben.
l appreciate it.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.012
Bye.

24:19.424 --> 24:20.914
Oh, wait.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.328
Helmet?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.658
So sorry. Thanks.

24:33.538 --> 24:37.304
-You're sure you know where you're going?
-Yes.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.306
No.

24:40.479 --> 24:44.347
l'm supposed to be meeting a friend
of mine at this bar, Marquis de Sade.

24:44.516 --> 24:48.316
-Do you have any idea where that is?
-Hang on.

24:50.388 --> 24:55.325
Mate, it's me. l've got a question for you.
Marquis de Sade bar, what's the address?

24:55.494 --> 24:58.258
The corner of Jakubska and Templova.

24:58.430 --> 25:01.365
Okay, yeah. See you later, mate. Bye.

25:03.268 --> 25:08.900
Ben, l know you probably think
l'm this really rude....

25:09.074 --> 25:11.099
Thank you.

25:14.713 --> 25:16.613
Hold on.

25:28.860 --> 25:33.388
-So you a big drinker?
-l drink.

25:37.435 --> 25:40.871
-You're not drinking?
-You're getting pissed for the both of us.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.201
So where are you headed?

25:45.677 --> 25:47.770
l am kind of...

25:47.946 --> 25:52.076
...backpacking through Europe
on my way to Berlin for the Love Parade.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.048
Oh, right.
Where's your backpack?

25:56.288 --> 26:01.055
-Backpacking is just an expression.
-Oh, yeah.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.887
For what?

26:05.764 --> 26:10.292
Fine. Okay, fine. You caught me.
l'm on vacation here with my parents...

26:10.468 --> 26:15.906
...and it's this numbing series of five-star
hotels and seven-course brunches.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.532
-And l just can't take it anymore.
-lt's tough to take, l guess.

26:19.711 --> 26:23.010
You know, chocolate mint
on your silk pillow. Nightmare.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.458
So...

26:35.160 --> 26:36.684
...what's your story?

26:36.861 --> 26:40.592
l mean, like, why are you here
all by your eyelashes?

26:44.069 --> 26:47.937
-l mean, self.
-Well, actually, l'm here on holiday.

26:48.573 --> 26:54.637
lndulging in my passion for photography.
Taking pictures of European architecture...

26:54.813 --> 26:58.715
-...and drunk teenage fugitives, of course.
-Hey. l'm not some drunk--

27:01.386 --> 27:02.944
Holy shit.

27:04.889 --> 27:07.517
l have to go. Oh, God, l have to go.

27:08.059 --> 27:13.019
Why don't you duck into the loos
and, kind of, kill two birds sort of thing.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.026
You....

27:17.569 --> 27:19.059
You are great.

27:19.237 --> 27:23.503
You. You stay here, you. Okay?

27:23.675 --> 27:25.666
Be back.

27:35.186 --> 27:38.087
-What took you so long?
-Why'd you leave, Agent Calder?

27:38.256 --> 27:40.486
You should have stopped her
at the concert.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.595
And let the first daughter cause a scene
with photographers hanging around?

27:44.763 --> 27:48.859
She's yours. She's hiding in the loos
and drunk, so l'm sure she'll go easy.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.002
l'll check in with you later.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.974
-He's tall.
-What?

27:57.142 --> 27:59.042
He's tall. Great.

27:59.210 --> 28:02.646
-She ran off with a stranger.
-You said he was Secret Service.

28:02.814 --> 28:06.545
-lt smells like wet cigars.
-She does not know he's Secret Service.

28:06.718 --> 28:09.016
l think the maid was smoking.

28:09.487 --> 28:11.648
She's desperate for freedom, Jim.

28:11.823 --> 28:14.553
You pushed her into this
with your lack of trust.

28:14.726 --> 28:17.354
You'd tell me if you started
smoking again, right?

28:17.529 --> 28:22.125
You want me to trust some person that
would go off with a complete stranger?

28:22.300 --> 28:25.929
-Of course l'd tell you.
-l thought you said he was Secret Service.

28:26.104 --> 28:30.541
-She does not know that.
-The maid smokes cigars?

28:30.709 --> 28:34.008
Wait. She doesn't know that.

28:34.179 --> 28:37.444
How can a president
with a 63 percent approval rating...

28:37.615 --> 28:40.880
...have absolutely no understanding
of his teenage daughter?

28:41.052 --> 28:43.714
She needs at least
the illusion of independence.

28:43.888 --> 28:46.948
That's exactly what l'm gonna give her.

28:47.358 --> 28:49.918
Phil! Harper!

28:50.595 --> 28:53.029
-Yes, Mr. President.
-Tell me about Ben Calder.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.564
Very capable. Youngest agent in Europe.

28:55.734 --> 28:59.966
Father was American. Respected ClA.
Killed in the line of duty seven years ago.

29:00.138 --> 29:02.572
Ben was raised in England
by a British mother.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.971
-Harper, get Ben Calder on the phone.
-Sir.

29:05.143 --> 29:08.544
-Phil, contact Weiss and Morales.
-Sir.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.875
-What are you doing?
-Get Calder.

29:11.049 --> 29:13.779
She wants freedom? Let freedom ring.

29:13.952 --> 29:17.080
-l don't know if he can handle that.
-What do you want now?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.485
-<i>Ben Calder.</i>
-Whatever you say.

29:19.657 --> 29:23.115
-Mr. President, hello.
-l want you to keep our daughter.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.626
-Sir?
-Make sure she has no idea who you are.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.492
-But, Jim--
-But, sir--

29:27.665 --> 29:31.601
Weiss and Morales are being informed
of this plan as we speak.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.330
-<i>James.</i>
-Mr. President, with all due respect--

29:34.506 --> 29:38.602
All due respect would mean accepting
this duty without protest, Calder.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.211
-My apologies.
-l know my daughter.

29:41.379 --> 29:44.177
Without MTV and clean sheets
she'll beg to come home.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.941
What if she doesn't, sir?

29:46.117 --> 29:49.211
The point is to get a little rebellion
out of her system...

29:49.387 --> 29:53.380
<i>...without risk to her</i>
<i>or revealing your identity. Ever.</i>

29:53.892 --> 29:57.794
And that's paramount, Calder. Ever.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.965
lt's all you, baby.

30:05.036 --> 30:08.494
-l don't think we should be doing this.
-l want Anna to be happy.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.506
You think the only way
is to give her freedom...

30:11.676 --> 30:13.337
...so that's what l'm doing.

30:13.511 --> 30:17.174
Only, l'm gonna be the one
controlling that freedom.

30:18.116 --> 30:21.552
Trust me. lt's perfect diplomacy in action.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.389
They just left?

30:28.560 --> 30:33.998
Yeah, l guess you gave them the slip.
Too smart for them, hey?

30:34.599 --> 30:36.533
So l'm free.

30:38.837 --> 30:44.639
Yes! l finally will get
to experience the real Prague.

30:44.809 --> 30:47.937
l wanna taste it. l wanna smell it.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.637
Be sure to smell it before you taste it.

30:50.815 --> 30:54.342
-Ben, l wanna find passion--
-Awful.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.749
-Sorry about that, we're just--
-Yeah.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.183
Looking for passion.

31:02.026 --> 31:06.520
Tell you what. Second thoughts.
Why don't we just forget the bike.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.029
Okay. Sorry.

31:50.008 --> 31:54.240
lt's so beautiful.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.472
-Okay, now you've seen it. Let's go.
-Hold this.

31:58.149 --> 32:01.118
-What are you doing?
-l'm taking my clothes off.

32:03.821 --> 32:07.450
-Can you please stop it?
-l told you, l wanna experience freedom...

32:07.625 --> 32:09.217
...at its utmost freest.

32:09.394 --> 32:13.854
l wanna swim naked in the Danube!

32:14.032 --> 32:16.500
Actually, it's the Vltava.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.603
Who wants to swim naked in the Vltava?
Nobody says that.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.831
ln English, Vltava means
''unhealthy bacteria level.''

32:23.007 --> 32:25.475
-Yeah, right.
-Why can't you be free...

32:25.643 --> 32:29.238
-...without being naked?
-Can you help me unhook this?

32:29.447 --> 32:32.746
-Oh, good Lord.
-Never mind. l got it.

32:32.917 --> 32:36.148
l'm a dead man. l am officially a dead man.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.948
Oh, perfect.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.493
Anna, get here right now.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.655
This is inappropriate behavior
in a public place.

32:47.832 --> 32:51.165
-l'm not coming in that water.
-Like to buy that camera, please.

32:51.336 --> 32:53.463
Why would l want to--?

32:58.910 --> 33:01.310
-Okay.
-Thank you. There.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.606
Pleasure doing business with you.

33:03.781 --> 33:07.239
Honey? You know, let's get a quick shot.

33:07.418 --> 33:10.012
-Just one for the kids. Quick one.
-Smile.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.679
All right, what do you say? Schnitzel.

33:18.062 --> 33:19.324
l tell you what.

33:19.497 --> 33:23.991
l bet a nice, warm bubble bath back
at the hotel would be fabulous about now.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.899
-lt would be my pleasure to escort you.
-No. l've smelled the city...

33:28.072 --> 33:32.202
-...and now l wanna taste it.
-God, l knew you were gonna say that.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.641
You are no fun. You know that?

33:34.846 --> 33:39.306
Oh, l'm sorry. l tend to lose my <i>joi de vivre</i>
when l'm cold, wet...

33:39.484 --> 33:41.452
...and starting to chafe.

33:41.619 --> 33:44.679
lt's your own fault.
Who swims fully clothed in the Danube?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.290
We've been over this.

33:50.061 --> 33:52.586
Where's that music coming from?

33:56.901 --> 33:59.961
Oh, my God.

34:02.106 --> 34:04.097
lt's amazing.

34:13.717 --> 34:18.382
l wanna see it from up there.

34:23.795 --> 34:28.822
See, what you don't understand is,
like, this is historic for me.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.402
No one ever lets me do anything
remotely dangerous, and l'm never alone.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.540
Anyway, it's not like this
is that dangerous or anything.

34:36.706 --> 34:39.266
Well, not unless you grab the pipe.

34:43.848 --> 34:45.281
Oh, God.

34:51.688 --> 34:55.750
All right, it's probably best if you hold
your horses and let me go first...

34:55.927 --> 35:00.387
...because this looks to me like
it could be a little bit...

35:00.565 --> 35:02.055
...tricky.

35:03.968 --> 35:09.497
-We almost died. That was incredible.
-Not too dramatic, are you?

35:10.875 --> 35:12.740
Come and have a look at this.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.975
This is incredible.

35:21.152 --> 35:24.952
You see that woman?
She thinks that she's just having a dream.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.149
But she's not, and he's deceiving her.

35:28.326 --> 35:32.763
Yeah? Well, how else can Paris get Helen
to show him how she truly feels?

35:32.930 --> 35:35.296
lt's the perfect deception.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.401
So it's all right to deceive
with good reason?

35:38.569 --> 35:39.900
Here's my theory.

35:40.071 --> 35:43.563
Telling the truth isn't always good,
but lying isn't always bad.

35:43.741 --> 35:47.040
lf telling the truth makes someone feel bad,
lying can be good.

35:47.211 --> 35:50.476
Good things can come from lying,
bad things from the truth...

35:50.648 --> 35:54.846
...although sometimes telling part of the
truth is the same thing as telling a lie.

35:55.019 --> 35:58.011
-And that's good or bad?
-l don't know.

35:58.189 --> 36:01.556
That part of the theory
is kind of new for me.

36:05.096 --> 36:06.791
Anna.

36:18.409 --> 36:20.001
Beautiful.

36:25.383 --> 36:27.374
lsn't this romantic?

36:28.653 --> 36:31.679
Almost like we're on a date,
isn't it, Morales?

36:31.856 --> 36:36.520
Yeah, right. You on a last-name basis
with most of your girlfriends?

36:38.462 --> 36:40.930
-Cynthia.
-Please, don't. Just don't.

36:41.098 --> 36:44.158
l know. l know, it didn't feel right. Sorry.

36:49.540 --> 36:53.636
Offenbach is okay,
but l much prefer the ltalian operas.

36:53.811 --> 36:58.180
You know, tragic and romantic.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.976
l'm terribly sorry, milady.

37:00.151 --> 37:03.678
All those rooftops were booked
this evening, so deal with it.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.055
<i>Rigoletto</i> is my favorite.

37:08.226 --> 37:14.426
l can totally relate to Gilda, you know,
cloistered and love-starved in the nunnery.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.299
Come on.

37:16.467 --> 37:21.336
Trips to Europe. Tickets to the opera.
Your life can't possibly be that bad.

37:21.505 --> 37:24.497
l never said it was bad. lt's just...

37:26.477 --> 37:28.104
...lonely.

37:30.248 --> 37:34.378
And the funny thing is
l am never, ever alone.

37:45.696 --> 37:48.494
Beer is good, isn't it?

37:49.800 --> 37:52.030
l've always thought so.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.702
Oh, my God.

39:08.446 --> 39:10.710
What time is it?
l need to call my parents.

39:10.881 --> 39:15.011
-l thought you wanted to be liberated.
-Liberated, yes. Grounded, no.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.622
-Can l use your cell phone, please?
-Dead, l'm afraid.

39:18.789 --> 39:21.690
Drenched with your Danube.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.925
-Are these correct?
-Approximations.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.894
-l want exact numbers. How long?
-Approximately?

39:28.065 --> 39:29.726
-Just get them.
-Yes, sir.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.461
-Home base. Go.
-<i>Hi. lt's Anna. Can l speak to my mom?</i>

39:34.538 --> 39:35.903
Honey, are you okay?

39:36.540 --> 39:41.739
Yes, Mom, l'm fine. l'm totally fine,
okay? Don't worry about me.

39:42.613 --> 39:44.046
How's Dad?

39:44.582 --> 39:47.050
-Anna?
-Dad? Listen to me.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.449
You were wrong. You broke your promise.
l needed your trust.

39:50.621 --> 39:54.717
When l saw you sent all those agents,
l went crazy, which l know wasn't right.

39:54.892 --> 39:58.259
This is your fault,
so l'll give you the chance to apologize.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.561
You're right, sweetie.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.529
l shouldn't be making promises
l don't intend to keep.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.896
Maybe l can learn to lighten up a bit.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.765
Sir.

40:07.938 --> 40:11.101
Dad, thank you very much
for not being mad about this.

40:11.275 --> 40:14.403
l was your age once too.
l'm just glad you're safe.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.977
l don't know.

40:16.147 --> 40:21.016
You know what? l'm gonna say it. You guys
have officially turned into cool parents.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.881
-<i>Maybe you're starting to</i>--
-Anna Catherine Foster...

40:24.054 --> 40:26.147
...you get yourself
back here right now.

40:26.323 --> 40:28.848
-<i>Your little adventure is over with.</i>
-What?

40:29.026 --> 40:32.018
See what your daughter's been up to?
l want her here now.

40:32.196 --> 40:34.187
-What about ''let freedom ring''?
-Where is she?

40:34.365 --> 40:36.196
-Train station.
-Listen to me.

40:36.367 --> 40:39.461
You do not, you hear me,
do not get on a train!

40:39.637 --> 40:42.936
Are you kidding? You traced my call?

40:43.107 --> 40:47.976
l'm your father. And the president.
l'll trace whatever l wanna trace.

40:48.145 --> 40:51.308
Know what? l'll meet you
on the plane on Sunday. Trace this.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.847
Anna?

40:53.751 --> 40:56.117
Get her brought in.
Get Calder on the phone.

40:56.287 --> 41:00.485
-Ben. lt's time for me to go now.
-So where are they picking you up?

41:00.658 --> 41:04.526
They're not. l'm not going back.
l'm going to Berlin for the Love Parade.

41:04.695 --> 41:08.028
-You're not going back with your parents?
-No, they turned cool.

41:08.199 --> 41:13.330
They told me to fly like the wind
or something. Are you gonna come?

41:13.504 --> 41:16.701
-l'm not gonna chase you through Europe.
-l can go by myself.

41:16.874 --> 41:18.307
-Well, you can't.
-Why not?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.943
-Because.
-Because why?

41:20.110 --> 41:23.341
Because European railway travel
can be very dangerous.

41:23.514 --> 41:27.450
l mean, it's the preferred method of travel
for delinquents and lunatics...

41:27.618 --> 41:33.113
...perverts, thieves, the odd slasher now
and again. They're not properly maintained.

41:33.290 --> 41:37.226
-The trains. The slashers are world-class.
-Yeah. Nice try, Ben. Thanks.

41:37.394 --> 41:42.354
-Anna, just stop and think, will you?
-l don't wanna think. l wanna live.

41:42.533 --> 41:46.196
l am so tired of knowing where l'm
gonna be every second of every day.

41:46.370 --> 41:49.601
Prisoners have more freedom
than l do. l just....

41:49.773 --> 41:53.334
l want real life, where real things happen.

41:53.511 --> 41:57.072
Real life is overrated. lt's a lot
of odd smells and disappointment.

41:57.248 --> 42:00.684
-Besides, you don't even have any money.
-l have enough.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.810
When l researched the Love Parade,
l read about this girl from Cleveland...

42:04.989 --> 42:08.447
...who made it on 2 bucks.
She sold her poetry along the way.

42:08.626 --> 42:10.992
By the time she got there,
she made $ 1 00,000.

42:11.161 --> 42:13.186
-Bollocks.
-l read it on the lnternet.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.629
On the lnternet,
Elvis is the conductor on the Orient Express.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.633
-l have this theory.
-Great, another theory. Hit me.

42:19.803 --> 42:22.294
lf something's meant to happen, it will.

42:22.473 --> 42:24.600
-That's a short one.
-No time. Thank you.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.402
-Bye.
-You're killing me.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.204
All right, we got them.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.706
The tracks are this way.

42:36.587 --> 42:39.852
Hurry. Hurry. Which one is it?

42:40.024 --> 42:42.322
-Probably the green one.
-Thank you.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.996
Sir? Excuse me. Can you tell me
which train goes to Berlin?

42:46.430 --> 42:48.125
-That one.
-Thank you.

43:00.210 --> 43:02.075
Berlin, over there.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.804
-What?
-Nothing.

43:33.010 --> 43:36.776
-Why is it l find that highly unlikely?
-You have a little thing for me.

43:36.947 --> 43:41.884
l'll stop you there. l do not have
a thing for you. Little or otherwise.

43:42.052 --> 43:45.180
Why did you get on the train
with me to Berlin, then?

43:48.592 --> 43:50.423
Okay, you know what? You're right.

43:50.594 --> 43:53.825
l'm attracted to exhibitionist runaways.
lt's an addiction.

43:53.998 --> 43:58.628
l was in a program where we had to
spend time with fully clothed homebodies...

43:58.802 --> 44:00.394
...but l've relapsed again.

44:00.571 --> 44:04.598
Nobody forced you to come with me.
l don't need a babysitter.

44:05.943 --> 44:07.433
What?

44:07.611 --> 44:11.513
What is that smile for?
You don't think l can take care of myself?

44:11.682 --> 44:16.085
Just because we spent the last 1 5 hours
together and l've rescued you 1 5 times...

44:16.253 --> 44:19.347
...which, for the record,
works out at once an hour...

44:19.523 --> 44:23.459
...how could l think you couldn't
take care of yourself? That's ridiculous.

44:23.627 --> 44:26.858
Would you get over yourself?
l don't need you. l'm sorry.

44:27.031 --> 44:30.125
lf that's what you think of me,
why don't you just leave.

44:30.300 --> 44:35.533
Seriously. Go.
Bye-bye. l don't need you.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.767
Why aren't you leaving?

44:40.544 --> 44:42.944
We're on a moving train.

44:44.982 --> 44:48.850
Fine. Then don't talk to me.

45:18.816 --> 45:21.250
<i>Not on this train. Great.</i>

45:21.418 --> 45:24.615
This is a Mickey Mouse assignment.
l resent it. Do you?

45:24.788 --> 45:26.346
-No.
-l do.

45:26.523 --> 45:29.356
-l just do what l'm told.
-Oh, yeah? Strip naked.

45:30.794 --> 45:34.958
Oh, gosh. Let me ask you something,
Weiss. Do you actually get women like this?

45:35.132 --> 45:39.296
l was really curious if there were actually
women out there in the world...

45:39.470 --> 45:43.839
...who walk by the construction lunch break
which is your very personality and say:

45:44.007 --> 45:46.840
''Oh, yeah, please. Baby, give it to me.

45:47.010 --> 45:51.413
Give me some of that hard hat,
right here, right now.''

45:51.815 --> 45:53.783
There are actually women like that?

45:56.787 --> 45:58.220
A couple.

46:08.165 --> 46:09.996
Hello, sleepy.

46:12.870 --> 46:15.338
Toblerone? lt's got almonds.

46:15.739 --> 46:18.674
Oh, gosh. No, thanks.

46:18.942 --> 46:21.706
l'm not really a nut person.

46:22.846 --> 46:25.110
-Don't l know you?
-No, l don't think so.

46:25.549 --> 46:29.076
-l guess not. Scotty McGruff.
-Hi. l'm Anna.

46:29.253 --> 46:31.380
-Oh, right.
-That's Ben.

46:31.922 --> 46:36.382
Hello. So are you two...?

46:36.693 --> 46:38.024
No.

46:38.829 --> 46:42.697
Yeah, Ben here accidentally got
on this train when he meant to get on...

46:42.866 --> 46:45.664
...the knight-in-shining-armor express.

46:46.570 --> 46:48.970
-So you're not together?
-Definitely not.

46:49.406 --> 46:52.239
Delight.

46:52.976 --> 46:57.379
So, Anna, ever made slow love
on a high-speed train?

46:57.548 --> 47:00.244
Sorry, Romeo. Sun's in my eyes.

47:00.417 --> 47:03.909
Mellow yellow, mate.
l was just making conversation.

47:04.087 --> 47:09.115
No one's looking to snag your travel buddy.
ln fact, l prefer to float along alone.

47:09.293 --> 47:13.923
-Just me, my tunes and my knapsack.
-And your sandals.

47:14.932 --> 47:17.492
-You sassing my Air Jesus?
-Don't listen to Ben.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.637
-He's full of himself.
-Something you need to talk about?

47:20.804 --> 47:23.170
Oh, no. Ben's issues are not my problem.

47:23.340 --> 47:27.436
He doesn't know me, because
l'm not the selfish brat he thinks l am.

47:27.611 --> 47:33.345
-l never said you were selfish.
-You know nothing about my life. Nothing.

47:33.517 --> 47:36.452
-No, l suppose l don't.
-Whatever.

47:36.620 --> 47:40.920
lt doesn't matter, because when this train
stops we'll go our separate directions.

47:41.091 --> 47:45.926
Chilly willy, squabblers. Take a few
of these on your solo travels, then.

47:46.530 --> 47:49.590
What are these?
<i>Six Million Dollar Man</i> stickers.

47:49.766 --> 47:55.432
These stickers are my contribution
to the global community.

47:55.606 --> 47:59.269
Everyone l meet gets a handful.
Your job, post them up.

47:59.543 --> 48:03.570
Pound one on a door, slap one on a kiosk,
place one on a postbox...

48:03.747 --> 48:05.977
...wherever your life may lead you.

48:06.149 --> 48:08.447
-And then what?
-Then, nothing.

48:08.719 --> 48:14.089
You forget about the sticker. You move on.
One day, maybe you're down in the dregs.

48:14.258 --> 48:16.317
And all of a sudden, there it is.

48:16.660 --> 48:20.994
ln the corner of a window, the door of a
subway, the side of a telephone booth.

48:21.164 --> 48:24.827
One of the stickers. lt puts a smile
on your face because you know...

48:25.002 --> 48:29.735
...you are not alone in the world.
We're all connected.

48:30.374 --> 48:32.069
Wanker.

48:39.683 --> 48:41.412
Want some?

48:54.598 --> 48:57.692
Hey, listen. l'm sorry
l treated you like a child.

48:57.868 --> 49:01.360
l was just feeling a little bit overprotective.

49:01.772 --> 49:06.402
Thank you. That's very nice of you,
but l already have a father.

49:06.576 --> 49:08.066
Yeah.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.810
God, get off me.

49:13.817 --> 49:15.648
Rock on, mate.

49:17.421 --> 49:19.821
Oh, my new friends.

49:20.157 --> 49:23.490
Who knows when the fickle finger
of fate will bring us together?

49:23.660 --> 49:27.653
l propose a moment of silent bonding
before we reach Venice.

49:28.131 --> 49:30.190
Before we get where?

49:36.640 --> 49:40.599
Okay. So we got on the wrong train.
So what?

49:40.777 --> 49:46.374
-Let's just make the best of our misfortune.
-Our misfortune will last until tomorrow...

49:46.550 --> 49:50.111
...because the next train
to Berlin is in the morning.

49:50.554 --> 49:55.491
So it's just a bit of a diversion.
Come on, enjoy. Take a picture.

50:01.198 --> 50:06.636
This could be one of the most
beautiful places l have ever seen.

50:06.803 --> 50:09.431
Be with you in two shakes.
l'm gonna make a call.

50:09.606 --> 50:12.439
No worries. l'll look after her.

50:17.647 --> 50:19.842
Sir, l got Agent Calder.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.017
They're putting him through.

50:31.428 --> 50:34.727
-For God's sake. Anna?
-<i>Calder? Calder?</i>

50:35.899 --> 50:38.424
-We lost him.
-Great.

50:38.602 --> 50:42.197
-The call came from Venice.
-Weiss and Morales are halfway to Berlin.

50:42.372 --> 50:46.900
-We can get them to Venice in a few hours.
-We can have agents in the city in minutes.

50:47.077 --> 50:52.310
l do not want to cause a scene. Just get
them to Venice and keep calling Calder.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.206
Anna!

50:59.222 --> 51:00.689
Anna!

51:09.766 --> 51:11.393
Ben!

51:11.935 --> 51:14.995
Come on. Venice awaits.
Where have you been?

51:15.172 --> 51:17.834
Just having a mild heart attack.

51:19.176 --> 51:20.973
Come on.

51:37.127 --> 51:39.960
Look at this!

52:11.561 --> 52:13.620
Check it out.

52:15.532 --> 52:17.397
Check it out.

52:18.568 --> 52:20.729
-You're so gullible.
-Yeah.

52:30.747 --> 52:32.544
Can l have one of those?

52:43.460 --> 52:45.587
Shopping!

53:14.524 --> 53:16.685
Marry her, Steve.

53:19.329 --> 53:22.924
l say we hit all the tourist spots.
Anna will want to see the sights.

53:23.099 --> 53:24.862
Whatever you say.

53:34.177 --> 53:36.873
-Knock it off.
-What? l'm not doing anything.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.948
-What's the problem?
-No problem.

53:40.116 --> 53:41.981
No problem.

53:42.852 --> 53:46.344
Here in the construction lunch break
that is my very personality...

53:46.523 --> 53:48.821
...l'm adding on a sensitivity wing.

53:48.992 --> 53:51.586
-l didn't really mean any of that.
-Yeah, you did.

53:53.163 --> 53:55.791
Well, mostly l did, yeah.

54:02.305 --> 54:05.103
-lt looks good to me.
-No <i>gelato</i>.

54:05.275 --> 54:07.971
l need to refuel my belly
with some tasty yumminess.

54:08.144 --> 54:11.341
-l'll get it to go and meet you back here.
-Okay.

54:12.382 --> 54:16.580
So nice to make new friends.
Group hug.

54:18.755 --> 54:22.191
-Sweetness.
-Ben.

54:22.692 --> 54:25.126
-Come on.
-Come on. Join in the hug, Ben.

54:25.295 --> 54:28.696
-We've got a chickie buffer here.
-l'm a chickie buffer.

54:29.199 --> 54:33.533
Chickie buffer negates the potential
for man-touching-man discomfort.

54:33.703 --> 54:37.639
Ben, hug us. Please, please, please.

54:38.208 --> 54:41.200
Quickly. Very quickly.

54:42.779 --> 54:44.906
Delight!

54:53.957 --> 54:56.221
l wonder where McGruff is.

54:56.393 --> 54:59.988
Probably off taking a bath in canal water.

55:01.298 --> 55:05.894
Please. Come on, can you just admit for
once that you've had a little bit of fun?

55:06.469 --> 55:08.494
Maybe a little bit of fun.

55:13.043 --> 55:15.534
-Very attractive.
-Very funny.

55:15.712 --> 55:19.978
Wonderful. Smile. Darling. Smile.

55:25.188 --> 55:28.624
Come on. Don't be shy. There we go.

55:28.792 --> 55:30.692
Oh, my God.

55:31.294 --> 55:32.886
Ben.

55:33.530 --> 55:37.591
Ben, l have stickers. l have no wallet.
l think McGruff stole from me.

55:37.767 --> 55:41.225
-Calm down, don't make a scene.
-No, l have stickers, no money.

55:41.404 --> 55:44.339
l have.... Stickers.

55:44.507 --> 55:46.372
-lsn't that Anna Foster?
-Damn it.

55:46.543 --> 55:48.977
-l have to go.
-l'll talk to the manager--

55:49.145 --> 55:52.672
l can't explain now, but thank you
for everything you've done.

55:52.849 --> 55:55.613
l have to go. l'll see you later.
Thank you.

55:55.785 --> 55:57.844
Here we go again.

55:59.923 --> 56:02.118
-There she is.
-Anna!

56:02.292 --> 56:03.884
Pull it over.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.794
Anna!

56:41.898 --> 56:43.331
This way.

57:02.552 --> 57:03.985
Gondola?

57:04.154 --> 57:05.644
-Yes.
-No.

57:06.689 --> 57:08.520
My first customer.

57:09.259 --> 57:12.228
The other <i>gondolieri</i>, they put me here,
but nobody visit.

57:12.395 --> 57:17.526
l tell them, ''Nobody come to my bridge.''
They say, ''Somebody will, Eugenio.''

57:17.700 --> 57:19.497
And now you are here.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.235
We don't have any money.

57:26.225 --> 57:29.786
-Well, then, l'm sorry.
-But, sir, we're newlyweds.

57:29.962 --> 57:34.331
-Right? Right, honey?
-That's right, sweetums.

57:34.500 --> 57:38.197
Precious, l just love it
when you call me that.

57:39.338 --> 57:42.102
Your love, it's beautiful.

57:44.443 --> 57:46.968
-No money, no ride.
-Sir, please.

57:47.146 --> 57:49.944
We were married
against my parents' wishes.

57:50.115 --> 57:54.518
-We tried to stay apart, but it was no good.
-Exactly, because l would rather die...

57:54.686 --> 58:00.056
...than live another day
without my lover man.

58:00.225 --> 58:02.659
We have nothing but we have everything.

58:02.828 --> 58:08.562
We've come so far
on only the currency of young love.

58:12.004 --> 58:15.997
lf sweet stories could buy pasta,
you'd be very fat by now.

58:16.175 --> 58:17.836
Thank you.

58:18.143 --> 58:20.043
All right. Yes.

58:20.212 --> 58:24.273
For you, the canals are free tonight.
My first <i>cliente</i>.

58:24.450 --> 58:28.648
-Mama will be so proud!
-On second thought....

58:29.054 --> 58:31.454
After you, darling.

58:34.259 --> 58:38.093
Let me remember.
Where does this go?

58:38.263 --> 58:41.255
Just kidding!

58:41.433 --> 58:45.369
My first joke with my first customer.

58:56.415 --> 58:58.383
We did good, huh?

58:58.550 --> 59:02.646
l was a little worried when you went
to ''the currency of young love.''

59:02.821 --> 59:05.517
But apart from that,
you were fairly magnificent.

59:05.691 --> 59:08.159
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

59:08.727 --> 59:12.663
You know, l just married you,
but l know nothing about you.

59:12.831 --> 59:15.129
There's not much to know.

59:19.438 --> 59:22.930
Okay. Ben Calder, 23 years old.

59:23.108 --> 59:29.138
Born in Wales and then moved to London
with my mother when she left my father.

59:29.948 --> 59:32.348
My father...

59:33.118 --> 59:36.747
...was always at work. Never at home.

59:37.222 --> 59:41.124
My mother wanted him
to make the big gesture.

59:42.494 --> 59:44.291
What's the big gesture?

59:45.164 --> 59:47.997
You know, ''l'll quit for you.

59:48.167 --> 59:53.503
l'll stay home for you, darling.''

59:54.506 --> 59:56.337
But he didn't.

59:56.975 --> 01:00:01.071
Because.... Well, people don't
really do that, do they?

01:00:01.813 --> 01:00:04.111
l don't know what people do.

01:00:28.307 --> 01:00:30.172
Thank you, Ben.

01:00:30.576 --> 01:00:31.873
What for?

01:00:32.044 --> 01:00:35.536
l couldn't have done any
of this without you.

01:00:36.615 --> 01:00:41.211
Seems to me you'd have
been just fine on your own.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.989
<i>Amore</i>, such a beautiful thing.

01:01:23.629 --> 01:01:26.029
Take you back to your hotel now?

01:01:27.733 --> 01:01:31.294
Actually, we don't have a hotel.

01:01:34.539 --> 01:01:38.600
Newlyweds. First no money
and now no place to....

01:01:38.777 --> 01:01:40.677
To stay.

01:01:43.415 --> 01:01:45.406
You stay at my home.

01:01:45.584 --> 01:01:49.645
You can meet my mama.
She will be so happy.

01:01:54.993 --> 01:01:59.862
-Mama, please be nice.
-Why l let you buy that crazy boat?

01:02:00.032 --> 01:02:03.524
You were good accountant.
Now you killing me.

01:02:03.702 --> 01:02:07.729
-Mama, they're newlyweds.
-Newlyweds!

01:02:11.076 --> 01:02:15.035
-Eugenio, this is so kind of you.
-You're welcome.

01:02:20.252 --> 01:02:26.680
Tonight you are family.
You must stay and celebrate.

01:02:26.858 --> 01:02:30.385
You will sleep in Eugenio's room.
lt will bring him luck.

01:02:30.562 --> 01:02:32.530
Oh, no, that's--

01:02:33.665 --> 01:02:35.895
Change the sheets.

01:02:36.401 --> 01:02:39.859
l want you to try some of my <i>grappa</i>.

01:02:41.306 --> 01:02:42.671
Tell me your names.

01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:45.810
Well, l'm Ben. And this is...

01:02:47.679 --> 01:02:49.271
...Anna.

01:02:51.149 --> 01:02:55.950
<i>Make no mistake. America is committed</i>
<i>to backing leaders and nations...</i>

01:02:56.121 --> 01:03:01.684
<i>...that are paving the hard but rewarding</i>
<i>path toward political and economic reform.</i>

01:03:02.828 --> 01:03:06.457
Okay. Let's just check with the local police.

01:03:07.866 --> 01:03:11.461
To answer your question, no.
l don't get women that way.

01:03:11.636 --> 01:03:14.264
Haven't actually had a girlfriend since--

01:03:14.439 --> 01:03:17.840
Let's just say that women
stopped beating down my door...

01:03:18.009 --> 01:03:21.877
...about the same time the bangs
stopped covering the receding hair line.

01:03:26.752 --> 01:03:30.415
Stop overcompensating.
You're a good-looking....

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:33.954
You look fine. Some girls like a bald head.

01:03:34.126 --> 01:03:37.186
-l'm not bald yet.
-l'm just saying. You should embrace it.

01:03:37.362 --> 01:03:42.493
Maybe you could cut it really short.
Some girls like that. They think it's sexy.

01:04:02.287 --> 01:04:03.879
So....

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:08.053
l'm gonna sleep on the floor...

01:04:08.226 --> 01:04:12.094
...which means that
you can have the bed to yourself.

01:04:12.264 --> 01:04:15.665
You don't have to do that.
There's plenty of room here for both--

01:04:15.834 --> 01:04:18.769
No, no. lt's fine. l prefer the floor...

01:04:18.937 --> 01:04:21.531
...because it's just a bit...

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:27.171
...lower. Which l like. You know, so....

01:04:27.345 --> 01:04:28.778
Yeah.

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:42.150
Oh, come on. Don't be shy.
lt's our wedding night.

01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:46.224
-Ben?
-Night, now.

01:05:02.714 --> 01:05:06.047
-Where are you going?
-Anna, go to bed.

01:05:06.218 --> 01:05:08.243
l'm trying to.

01:05:09.921 --> 01:05:11.752
Over there.

01:05:13.925 --> 01:05:15.756
But, Ben, we....

01:05:16.561 --> 01:05:18.426
-We kissed--
-l understand that.

01:05:18.864 --> 01:05:22.163
And l liked it. l like you.
Will you stop walking away from me?

01:05:22.334 --> 01:05:25.963
-Anna!
-You don't need to protect me.

01:05:29.774 --> 01:05:33.733
-l know what l'm doing.
-No, you don't--

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:37.207
Can you please stop taking
your clothes off around me?

01:05:37.382 --> 01:05:39.316
-What's wrong with you?
-Anna...

01:05:39.484 --> 01:05:43.853
...what happened on the gondola
was me trying to hide you, nothing else.

01:05:44.022 --> 01:05:46.081
-That was a real kiss.
-No, it wasn't.

01:05:46.258 --> 01:05:48.226
-l don't believe you.
-lt's the truth.

01:05:48.393 --> 01:05:52.227
l told you. We're just two people traveling
in the same direction.

01:05:57.068 --> 01:05:59.127
So you didn't...

01:05:59.905 --> 01:06:03.272
...feel anything?

01:06:03.608 --> 01:06:07.601
No. l didn't feel anything.

01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:13.681
So can you please just get into bed?

01:06:29.301 --> 01:06:32.361
Naked virgin safely in bed.

01:07:00.899 --> 01:07:03.834
<i>Yes, sir. l understand, Mr. President.</i>

01:07:04.002 --> 01:07:07.233
Don't worry, we're gonna find her.

01:07:07.572 --> 01:07:09.062
Yes, sir.

01:07:09.541 --> 01:07:13.033
Did l mention what a ridiculous idea
this was to begin with, sir?

01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:15.372
One of your stupidest.

01:07:15.547 --> 01:07:17.742
He hung up before any of that.

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:27.289
You look at this view?

01:07:27.959 --> 01:07:29.449
ls Anna in it?

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:31.095
No.

01:07:31.262 --> 01:07:33.127
Let's keep moving.

01:07:33.298 --> 01:07:36.961
l'm not leaving this spot till you
take a moment to appreciate this.

01:07:42.407 --> 01:07:45.342
You know, it's not enough
just to be a beauty, Morales.

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:48.411
You have to be able
to appreciate beauty too.

01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:52.078
Nice to have you back, Weiss.

01:07:59.758 --> 01:08:03.125
l'd like to take a moment
to give thanks to Anna...

01:08:03.294 --> 01:08:07.162
...who ran from her parents, jumped
a train to Venice instead of Berlin...

01:08:07.332 --> 01:08:11.894
...thus giving us the opportunity
to witness this phenomenal sight.

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:14.095
-Amen.
-Finished?

01:08:17.975 --> 01:08:20.341
Oh, come on.

01:08:30.955 --> 01:08:32.819
lt's hip-hop Hebrew.

01:08:36.795 --> 01:08:38.819
You had a good night?

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.666
Yes, great. Thank you.

01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:44.960
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

01:08:45.403 --> 01:08:50.841
But you were very quiet.
The walls is like paper, but l hear nothing.

01:08:51.009 --> 01:08:53.273
That's just because
he's repelled by me.

01:08:55.846 --> 01:08:57.404
But it's not true.

01:08:57.582 --> 01:09:00.745
Tell her she's a beautiful woman.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.644
You're a beautiful woman.

01:09:05.055 --> 01:09:06.716
And kiss her.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:11.919
Come on. You want a happy marriage,
you gotta kiss her every day.

01:09:14.933 --> 01:09:17.094
lt's okay. We'll work it out.

01:09:20.772 --> 01:09:23.332
Mama, where are the car keys?

01:09:23.508 --> 01:09:27.035
You driving with Eugenio?
Better kiss her now.

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:42.924
-The bike, the bike, the bike!
-ldiot!

01:09:48.733 --> 01:09:50.394
Thank you, darling.

01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:56.972
Eugenio, thank you so much for everything.
l wish l had something else to offer you.

01:09:57.709 --> 01:10:01.873
<i>Six Million Dollar Man</i>.
lt's a wonderful gift.

01:10:05.884 --> 01:10:09.752
A beautiful couple.
Take care of each other.

01:10:20.198 --> 01:10:23.224
-Hey.
-Don't touch me.

01:10:37.916 --> 01:10:39.406
English, <i>por favor.</i>

01:10:40.285 --> 01:10:41.547
That's Spanish, Weiss.

01:10:42.887 --> 01:10:45.754
<i>Allora</i>, about Eugenio.

01:10:46.424 --> 01:10:49.825
He was a good accountant.
Why he buy the stupid boat--?

01:10:50.228 --> 01:10:53.061
He was last seen with these two people.

01:11:00.305 --> 01:11:02.432
The newlyweds.

01:11:05.343 --> 01:11:10.246
l say we don't tell him until we have
something really good to go with it.

01:11:10.415 --> 01:11:15.614
We find her and say, ''Here's your daughter.
Sorry, Mr. President. She's married.''

01:11:15.787 --> 01:11:20.690
God, this is bad. lt was bad before,
but now it's beyond bad.

01:11:20.859 --> 01:11:24.989
Yep. This is pretty much
as bad as it gets.

01:11:25.997 --> 01:11:27.794
Now you touch me?

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:43.276
-They just crossed the Austrian border.
-Weiss and Morales are en route.

01:11:43.448 --> 01:11:45.507
No contact with Calder since yesterday.

01:11:45.683 --> 01:11:48.811
Enough. l want a full contingent
at that Love Parade.

01:11:48.987 --> 01:11:53.151
-Jim, how could you let this happen?
-l don't know. lt happened.

01:11:53.925 --> 01:11:55.950
Sir? There's one more thing.

01:11:57.161 --> 01:11:58.685
What else?

01:12:02.133 --> 01:12:04.294
We think they're married.

01:12:21.853 --> 01:12:26.688
So, what is it? Do you have a girlfriend?
l mean, is that who you called yesterday?

01:12:27.325 --> 01:12:28.917
No, no girlfriend.

01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:37.793
Okay, well, if you didn't like girls,
you could've just said something to me.

01:12:37.969 --> 01:12:40.335
Hey, listen, l like girls.

01:12:43.808 --> 01:12:47.244
Oh, okay. So you're just
not attracted to this one.

01:12:47.412 --> 01:12:52.315
No, that's okay. This whole time l felt alone
because l never had any opportunities...

01:12:52.483 --> 01:12:56.613
...because l never had privacy, but thanks
for proving me wrong. l needed that.

01:12:56.788 --> 01:12:59.279
Anna, believe me,
this is not about you.

01:13:00.825 --> 01:13:03.919
Romance is simply not...

01:13:04.095 --> 01:13:06.086
...a feasible option for me right now.

01:13:06.264 --> 01:13:11.429
Oh, God. Kill me now. l can't even attract
some guy who says stupid things like:

01:13:11.602 --> 01:13:14.400
''Romance is not a feasible option''?

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.636
You know what?
The joke is on you, my friend.

01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:22.246
l was just kidding last night.
l would never go through with it.

01:13:22.413 --> 01:13:23.675
Of course you wouldn't.

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:30.147
No! Stop!

01:13:31.055 --> 01:13:32.454
Anna, don't.

01:13:33.358 --> 01:13:34.825
Anna. Anna.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:37.461
Oh, come on.

01:13:40.465 --> 01:13:41.932
Bye-bye.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.609
Unbelievable.

01:14:50.535 --> 01:14:51.934
Good luck.

01:15:07.518 --> 01:15:09.008
Shit.

01:15:19.397 --> 01:15:23.766
Hi, l just-- <i>Guten tag</i>. That's the extent
of my German. l really need the bike.

01:16:01.038 --> 01:16:04.405
He's gonna jump.
No, no, no! Somebody stop him!

01:16:04.575 --> 01:16:06.133
No, don't do it!

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:08.642
Bungee!

01:16:17.955 --> 01:16:21.652
Very good. Very good.

01:16:37.909 --> 01:16:41.572
You found us on the lnternet?
Jumpinggermans.com?

01:16:41.746 --> 01:16:43.077
No.

01:16:47.718 --> 01:16:50.346
-McGruff?
-To life!

01:16:50.755 --> 01:16:52.347
McGruff.

01:16:53.257 --> 01:16:56.021
-Look. My reasons were noble.
-l trusted you.

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:59.254
l needed the scratch. What can l say?
Please forgive.

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:01.625
-Three, two, one, bungee!
-Bungee!

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:27.615
Need to put this tighter.

01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:39.426
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait!

01:17:41.906 --> 01:17:44.704
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:47.742
Get away from me.
l'm jumping, and you can't stop me.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.814
Bloody hell.

01:18:01.892 --> 01:18:03.359
lf you're scared, why do it?

01:18:05.563 --> 01:18:10.967
Because the things you're scared of are
usually the most worthwhile. Just a theory.

01:18:13.571 --> 01:18:16.335
You know what?
Actually, my dad taught me that.

01:18:20.077 --> 01:18:21.942
Hold tight.

01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:35.450
-God!
-Oh, my Lord.

01:18:47.271 --> 01:18:48.568
Hi.

01:18:49.573 --> 01:18:51.768
Hello. Here we go.

01:18:59.917 --> 01:19:02.442
l can't believe we just did that.

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.560
Check that out.

01:19:13.898 --> 01:19:16.958
Holy crap.

01:19:33.784 --> 01:19:35.979
Yeah, you'd better stay out there.

01:19:36.354 --> 01:19:38.515
You know, we needed that money.

01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:40.247
You guys got it all wrong.

01:19:40.424 --> 01:19:44.417
l gave most of it back.
Besides, that money was for love.

01:19:44.595 --> 01:19:49.225
l've been traipsing over this stinking
continent looking for a girl l've never met.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.631
We made goo-goo eyes
from, like, 30 meters.

01:19:52.803 --> 01:19:58.571
But our eyes locked. We connected,
which is next to impossible in this world.

01:19:58.743 --> 01:20:03.442
You know that. You can't let a feeling
like that pass you by.

01:20:07.518 --> 01:20:10.043
You'd hug him all over again,
wouldn't you?

01:20:14.425 --> 01:20:17.189
l'm all right. l'm all right.

01:20:29.407 --> 01:20:32.672
Just so you know,
that's incredibly hot.

01:20:33.611 --> 01:20:35.203
Oh, l'm sorry.

01:20:50.694 --> 01:20:52.855
Oh, hi, Gus Gus.

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:57.364
Gus Gus. So much of you
they had to name you twice.

01:20:57.535 --> 01:21:00.436
l thought you might need this.

01:21:01.772 --> 01:21:04.332
-Thanks.
-So....

01:21:07.678 --> 01:21:09.043
Yes?

01:21:10.781 --> 01:21:12.339
So....

01:21:13.017 --> 01:21:14.382
No.

01:21:19.056 --> 01:21:23.891
For a girl who claims to be terminally alone,
you sure do get a lot of offers.

01:21:24.929 --> 01:21:26.590
And rejections.

01:21:30.734 --> 01:21:32.099
You're right.

01:21:34.171 --> 01:21:38.267
You know what?
l'm tired of living my life just in theory.

01:21:38.943 --> 01:21:42.242
-l think l'm gonna go talk to Gus Gus.
-Oh, come on.

01:21:43.447 --> 01:21:46.848
You can't seriously be attracted
to that walking...

01:21:47.418 --> 01:21:48.885
...Alp.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.547
l don't know.

01:21:51.722 --> 01:21:54.623
l can see myself in the mountains,
raising children...

01:21:54.792 --> 01:21:59.058
...little Hans Hans and Gunther Gunther.

01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:01.129
Anna, don't.

01:22:03.167 --> 01:22:06.603
-Why not?
-Because l don't trust him.

01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:11.236
-l don't think he's good enough for you.
-Yeah, right.

01:22:11.408 --> 01:22:15.469
Because up until the last three days
l was perfectly content with my life...

01:22:15.646 --> 01:22:18.444
...of solitary adventure
and then you came along....

01:22:18.616 --> 01:22:23.110
Well, you came along and those
two things seemed mutually exclusive.

01:22:23.287 --> 01:22:24.652
Ben.

01:22:25.256 --> 01:22:30.592
Can you ever just say
what you really feel?

01:22:35.566 --> 01:22:37.261
Okay, all right.

01:22:37.434 --> 01:22:39.061
Because...

01:22:39.503 --> 01:22:41.528
...l'm jealous as hell.

01:22:41.705 --> 01:22:45.436
l'd hate to see you with Gus Gus.
l'd hate to see you with another man.

01:22:45.609 --> 01:22:49.443
Not only did l adore kissing you
in Venice...

01:22:49.947 --> 01:22:51.812
...but also because...

01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:57.383
...l'm so un-bloody-hinged
just being near you.

01:23:18.175 --> 01:23:19.836
l guess you fixed it, huh?

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.015
Anna.

01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:52.203
Calder.

01:23:52.376 --> 01:23:58.508
-Where the hell have you been?
-Listen, Weiss. She's here and she's safe.

01:23:58.682 --> 01:24:01.617
We've been trying to reach you.
Your orders changed.

01:24:01.785 --> 01:24:03.184
What're you talking about?

01:24:03.354 --> 01:24:07.620
Your assignment has been over since
you jumped on that train to Venice.

01:24:09.326 --> 01:24:10.884
-What?
-Ben?

01:24:13.497 --> 01:24:14.896
l'll be right there.

01:24:15.699 --> 01:24:17.030
Okay.

01:24:18.869 --> 01:24:20.131
l've gotta go, mate.

01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:22.669
Bring her in immediately.
We have a plan.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.933
l promised l'd take her to the parade.

01:24:25.109 --> 01:24:29.443
-Calder, listen to me. Listen.
-<i>l've got really bad reception here. l gotta</i>--

01:24:29.613 --> 01:24:31.342
Who was that?

01:24:33.517 --> 01:24:36.918
Just some friends from Prague
wondering where l am.

01:24:47.765 --> 01:24:52.464
-He's gonna take her to the parade.
-Well, l guess we're going to the parade.

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.271
What? What?

01:25:01.345 --> 01:25:03.006
You did this for me, right?

01:25:03.614 --> 01:25:06.777
-This? No, l didn't do it for you. What?
-Really?

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:09.783
No, it was-- l got tired of styling it,
you know.

01:25:11.188 --> 01:25:12.849
Okay.

01:25:15.492 --> 01:25:17.585
Because it's kind of sexy.

01:25:27.905 --> 01:25:31.966
-l'm sorry. Saw an opening, so l went for it.
-Sorry. Yeah.

01:25:44.688 --> 01:25:47.384
When we get Anna,
l'm gonna put you in that tower.

01:25:47.558 --> 01:25:49.958
You've been a very bad
super-secret agent.

01:25:56.633 --> 01:25:58.498
You've got cute morning hair.

01:25:58.669 --> 01:26:00.796
You've got cute everything.

01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:08.910
Hey, McGruff.

01:26:11.682 --> 01:26:14.708
Wanna go to the Love Parade,
see if mystery girl's there?

01:26:14.885 --> 01:26:16.113
Rock on.

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.952
Sir. We just heard from Weiss.

01:26:19.123 --> 01:26:21.956
Anna and Calder are going
to the Berlin Love Parade.

01:26:22.126 --> 01:26:24.026
-Get to Berlin.
-Yes, sir.

01:27:09.106 --> 01:27:10.733
Anna!

01:27:11.975 --> 01:27:16.878
Hey! Oh, my God!
Gabrielle, l never thought l'd find you.

01:27:17.915 --> 01:27:20.440
You made it. l was so worried.
Where were you?

01:27:20.617 --> 01:27:24.576
You have no idea what
it took us to get here.

01:27:27.057 --> 01:27:30.686
-Do l know you?
-My name is Scott Thomas McGruff.

01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:34.991
l know how to make a woman feel like
she's wearing laundry fresh out the dryer.

01:27:35.365 --> 01:27:37.196
Gabrielle Le Clerc.

01:27:38.068 --> 01:27:41.902
-He okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Just hold on to your wallet.

01:27:43.006 --> 01:27:44.405
Nice to meet you.

01:27:47.244 --> 01:27:50.645
-McGruff, what about your mystery girl?
-What girl?

01:27:53.317 --> 01:27:57.777
-Okay, you are glowing. Sex?
-No.

01:27:58.555 --> 01:28:00.182
Love.

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:12.794
Weiss, l'll need at least an hour
before you move in.

01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:15.996
The president is not waiting an hour
for his daughter.

01:28:16.173 --> 01:28:18.698
-lt's important to her.
-l don't care.

01:28:18.876 --> 01:28:20.901
l do, damn it.
So stick to the plan.

01:28:21.078 --> 01:28:23.603
l'll have her by the Victory Column
in one hour.

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:27.147
Then this whole thing will be over
and she'll be all yours.

01:28:27.451 --> 01:28:30.716
What is going on? Who the hell--?

01:28:30.888 --> 01:28:32.321
No, Anna. Just--

01:28:32.489 --> 01:28:33.888
No!

01:28:37.895 --> 01:28:40.489
You see a Victory Column
somewhere around here?

01:29:11.762 --> 01:29:13.423
Anna!

01:29:14.698 --> 01:29:17.064
-Let me explain.
-Get away from me.

01:29:17.234 --> 01:29:19.702
-l'm Secret Service.
-That is such bullshit.

01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:22.270
l was outside the consulate
when you ran.

01:29:22.439 --> 01:29:25.340
l was in contact with Weiss and Morales
the whole time.

01:29:29.479 --> 01:29:32.915
-Oh, my God.
-Your father gave you controlled freedom.

01:29:33.083 --> 01:29:34.573
So l was his safety net.

01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:39.813
And yours.

01:29:43.126 --> 01:29:46.994
-You lied to me?
-l know. l'm sorry. Jesus, l'm sorry.

01:29:47.164 --> 01:29:50.691
-But something happened along the way.
-No kidding, you asshole.

01:29:50.867 --> 01:29:55.031
-You gotta believe me.
-How can l believe anything at this point?

01:29:55.205 --> 01:29:59.369
That's what l'm telling you.
l didn't plan for it to happen, but it did.

01:30:01.478 --> 01:30:02.809
l fell in love with you.

01:30:10.721 --> 01:30:13.451
You can go to hell.
You and my father both.

01:30:17.894 --> 01:30:19.259
Anna.

01:30:42.486 --> 01:30:45.853
<i>This is Harper.</i>
<i>We're flying over the Love Parade now.</i>

01:30:56.333 --> 01:30:59.461
Excuse me.

01:31:15.218 --> 01:31:17.345
My grandmother throws
better than you.

01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:21.013
<i>Sprechen sie</i> English, punk?
Yeah, that's what l thought.

01:31:22.692 --> 01:31:24.353
Hey, where are you guys going?

01:31:26.196 --> 01:31:27.458
Hey, watch it.

01:31:28.398 --> 01:31:30.161
Hey, hey, hey.
Look who that is.

01:31:31.301 --> 01:31:34.031
-No. No way.
-lt's Anna Foster.

01:31:34.204 --> 01:31:35.796
-lt's Anna Foster, guys.
-Hey.

01:31:35.972 --> 01:31:38.770
-No. No, l'm not Anna, okay?
-Where you going?

01:31:38.942 --> 01:31:43.208
-Come on, Anna. Come on, precious.
-Excuse me. You've got the wrong person.

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.371
You're a bit far from the White House.

01:31:45.549 --> 01:31:47.710
-What you doing here?
-l need to go.

01:31:47.918 --> 01:31:50.478
-How about a date, babe?
-Don't touch me!

01:31:50.654 --> 01:31:54.317
-Wanna party? You're far from home.
-Leave me alone. Just stop!

01:31:55.025 --> 01:31:56.788
-Come on, Anna.
-Good God.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.726
-Hey, that's enough. Let's go.
-Come on. Get out of my way. Who're you?

01:32:01.131 --> 01:32:04.897
-Anna, let me help you get out of here.
-Thank you so much.

01:32:05.068 --> 01:32:07.866
Hey, you want some real fun?
Come with us, sexy.

01:32:08.038 --> 01:32:11.064
-Get away from me.
-Come with us. She's a princess.

01:32:37.033 --> 01:32:38.864
Anna, it's okay.

01:32:39.569 --> 01:32:41.537
You're safe.

01:32:52.749 --> 01:32:55.684
-You all right?
-Come on, Anna. Let's go home.

01:34:42.459 --> 01:34:46.953
Together we've been able to move
this humanitarian effort forward.

01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:49.724
This has taken the cooperation
of all our allies.

01:34:49.899 --> 01:34:56.134
But we are still confident
that these programs will benefit....

01:35:14.424 --> 01:35:16.255
How's your heart?

01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:18.761
lt's...

01:35:19.596 --> 01:35:21.461
...a little bit broken.

01:35:29.105 --> 01:35:31.471
Oh, Mom.

01:35:46.156 --> 01:35:49.990
Something about a college campus.
lsn't there, Morales? You know?

01:35:50.193 --> 01:35:53.629
-What do you mean?
-l mean, you know, the falling leaves...

01:35:53.797 --> 01:35:56.857
...the promise of youth,
the smell of curricula.

01:36:00.503 --> 01:36:04.234
l'm thinking we probably
gotta get new partners.

01:36:06.743 --> 01:36:09.075
-l'm thinking l'm okay with that.
-Yeah?

01:36:09.245 --> 01:36:10.906
-That so?
-Yeah.

01:36:11.081 --> 01:36:14.608
-As long as your partner's an old fat guy.
-l love old fat guys.

01:36:14.784 --> 01:36:16.979
-You do too. You do.
-l do.

01:36:17.153 --> 01:36:19.018
-What?
-You're so silly.

01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:20.451
You think?

01:36:27.130 --> 01:36:29.428
You guys are in love, huh?

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.760
-Yeah, l guess so.
-lt's amazing. l'm at this great school...

01:36:34.938 --> 01:36:37.133
...and there's not one course on love.

01:36:37.307 --> 01:36:41.368
You can't learn about love in a classroom.
The dorms, maybe.

01:36:41.544 --> 01:36:44.012
What? You can't learn about it
in a classroom.

01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.273
Love is not always that easy, Anna.

01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:49.184
Nothing worth getting ever is.

01:36:50.353 --> 01:36:53.254
Have you tried to get chili fries
on this campus?

01:36:53.423 --> 01:36:58.326
They sell chili. Oh, yes, and they sell the
fries. But they cannot put the two together.

01:36:58.495 --> 01:37:00.963
You got a building
with engineering students...

01:37:01.297 --> 01:37:02.787
-...but they--
-Just kiss me.

01:37:02.966 --> 01:37:04.331
Okay.

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:15.970
Anna. Welcome home.

01:37:16.146 --> 01:37:18.580
-Thank you. Happy holidays.
-Thanks. And you.

01:37:18.748 --> 01:37:21.512
Hey, Phil. ls he busy?

01:37:21.684 --> 01:37:23.584
Not for you.

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.651
-New shades?
-Yeah.

01:37:25.922 --> 01:37:29.016
-Nice. Hey, Harper. New suit?
-No.

01:37:32.128 --> 01:37:37.896
Hey, Buddy! Hi, Buddy.
How have you been? Hey.

01:37:38.067 --> 01:37:40.661
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hey, Daddy.

01:37:44.707 --> 01:37:46.971
You look....

01:37:47.911 --> 01:37:49.538
You look collegiate.

01:37:49.712 --> 01:37:51.441
Thanks.

01:37:53.383 --> 01:37:55.783
-How's school?
-lt's good. Yeah.

01:37:56.085 --> 01:37:59.919
-Good. Am l in any textbooks yet?
-No, not yet.

01:38:01.524 --> 01:38:04.357
l hope you're taking some time
to have some fun.

01:38:04.527 --> 01:38:06.722
-You do?
-Yeah.

01:38:06.896 --> 01:38:08.523
Since when?

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.665
-Anna.
-No, Dad. You know what?

01:38:13.837 --> 01:38:18.206
l know why you were so protective.
You didn't want me to get hurt...

01:38:18.374 --> 01:38:23.038
...and you were right. l needed protection
because people can't be trusted.

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:25.311
l have learned my lesson.

01:38:26.049 --> 01:38:28.313
l didn't want you to learn that lesson.

01:38:29.185 --> 01:38:30.743
Too late.

01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:37.384
God.

01:38:37.894 --> 01:38:40.624
l love this house at Christmas.

01:38:42.365 --> 01:38:44.094
We miss you around here, Anna.

01:38:55.445 --> 01:39:00.007
So have you given any more thought
to that exchange study program at Oxford?

01:39:00.183 --> 01:39:02.515
No, not really. Why?

01:39:02.819 --> 01:39:05.253
Just always thought
it was a great opportunity.

01:39:06.055 --> 01:39:07.716
Yeah, l guess.

01:39:09.592 --> 01:39:14.052
Okay, well, l'll leave you to it
and l will see you at dinner.

01:39:17.333 --> 01:39:21.269
-Do l smell cigar smoke? Dad.
-No.

01:39:21.437 --> 01:39:22.904
-Come on.
-l don't think so.

01:39:23.072 --> 01:39:26.405
-That's the story you're sticking with?
-Don't tell your mother.

01:39:32.715 --> 01:39:35.047
You remember Agent Calder?

01:39:35.818 --> 01:39:37.183
Ben.

01:39:37.654 --> 01:39:40.885
-Dad.
-He's not an agent anymore. He quit.

01:39:43.159 --> 01:39:46.617
-Really?
-Yeah, he's living in London now.

01:39:46.930 --> 01:39:49.797
Maybe he found something
he's more passionate about.

01:39:49.966 --> 01:39:51.297
Just a theory.

01:39:52.502 --> 01:39:53.901
Yeah.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.540
Thought you'd wanna know.

01:40:02.545 --> 01:40:03.910
Okay.

01:40:47.523 --> 01:40:50.583
Charlie, kill dimmer four and light one.

01:40:52.895 --> 01:40:54.294
Yeah.

01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:02.637
Hey, did you see who just walked in?

01:41:06.075 --> 01:41:10.034
Have you seen who just walked in?
That's the president's daughter.

01:41:15.752 --> 01:41:17.583
There's Anna Foster.

01:41:38.741 --> 01:41:40.174

-You did?
-Yeah.

01:41:59.762 --> 01:42:02.196

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.067

01:42:19.816 --> 01:42:21.443
Big thing.

-Yeah, why not?

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:55.500
