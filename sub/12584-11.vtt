WEBVTT

00:32.449 --> 00:35.285
I can't believe we're going
to be late for church.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.705
Bobby, you spring forward,
not spring back.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.998
Yes.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.500
Hank, we're gonna make it on time,
God willing.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.793
And if He's not willing,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.962
He's giving me way too many green lights.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.508
We are still gonna make it.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.219


00:53.303 --> 00:55.972


00:56.056 --> 00:57.474
Shoot.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.699
Uh, excuse me. Uh, these are our seats.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.285
-Pardon me?
Uh, you're probably new here.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.662
Uh, this is where my family always sits.

01:22.207 --> 01:27.420
So, uh, do you think maybe you could, uh,
you know, sit somewhere else?

01:28.338 --> 01:30.381
We're kind of settled in here.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.217
Well, no problem. We'll help you move.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.054
Look, we're staying.
Maybe you could sit somewhere else.

01:36.137 --> 01:39.057
-But... it's just...
Give it up, Hank.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.059
We'll have to sit in the back
with the coughers.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.355
And now I would like to welcome

01:45.438 --> 01:48.024
the newest members
of Arlen First Methodist.

01:48.108 --> 01:53.071
Would the Smith family please stand up
and accept our blessings? Uh... Oh.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.323
There you are, right down in front.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.242
And that is how Jesus...

01:57.325 --> 01:58.409
I can't get comfortable.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.329
What'd she say? I can't hear anything.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.374
Oh, great. Now the sun's
gonna bounce off that cross,

02:04.457 --> 02:06.084
and it's gonna hit me right in the eye.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.669
Ah. Dang it.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.547
It's just not right.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.007
I've been in the same place 12 years.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.135
I know God's up there, and He knows

02:15.218 --> 02:17.804
I'm smack dab in the middle
of the second pew.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.348
That was really embarrassing
at church this morning

02:20.431 --> 02:21.808
when you yelled out "What?"

02:21.891 --> 02:25.687
Reverend Stroup acted like
that new family owned the place.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.105
That's silly, Hank.

02:27.188 --> 02:31.025
Everybody knows our church is owned
by General Electric himself.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.945
-

02:34.028 --> 02:37.365
I'm having trouble letting
this pew situation go, Peggy.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.493
-I don't know, maybe I'm just being petty.
-You're not petty, honey.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.330
It is Stroup who has lost touch
with the little things that matter.

02:44.414 --> 02:48.751
I have offered her countless ideas
for adding some pizzazz to that church.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.336
She's rejected them all.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.756
Maybe we should try the new megachurch.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.592
I don't want to change churches.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.677
Besides, that place is too big.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.471
What's it got, 5,000 some-odd members?

03:00.555 --> 03:02.015
And it pampers all of them.

03:02.098 --> 03:05.768
They have their very own coffee shop,
florist, mini-mart, bank,

03:05.852 --> 03:08.646
and a dry cleaner that accepts
all competitors' coupons.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.106
If I wanted to go that route,

03:10.190 --> 03:13.318
I could just walk around the mall
and think about Jesus.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.529
No, I'm just gonna go have a talk
with Reverend Stroup.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.575
You see, we were running late,

03:20.658 --> 03:23.620
and when we got here,
someone was sitting in our seats.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.205
Your seats?

03:25.288 --> 03:30.043
Yes, ma'am, where we always sit.
Second row, right side, inside aisle.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.794
That new family was sitting there.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.756
Oh, the Smiths. Lovely young family.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.383
Anyway, we were wondering
if you could talk to them

03:37.467 --> 03:38.843
so it doesn't happen again.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.512
Hey, I know. Why don't we assign seats?

03:41.596 --> 03:42.764
I could make up a chart.

03:42.847 --> 03:46.809
Even if I wanted to,
and I don't, I can't do that.

03:47.018 --> 03:51.147
This is God's house, not mine,
not the Smiths', not yours.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.233
Hank, let it go.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.735
Okay, then.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.075
So, what do you do with an artichoke?

04:02.408 --> 04:03.284
Do you eat it?

04:03.368 --> 04:07.372
Yeah, just not the furry part
that looks like asbestos, honey.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.625
Uh, if a fellow was looking
for a new church,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.001
does anyone know a good one?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.673
I got a great church.
You're gonna love it.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.466
My church is made out of steel.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.552
You got to be right with God
to go to my church, honey.

04:21.636 --> 04:22.929
It's hardcore.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.223
All right, all right,
everyone, break it up.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.975
Give the man some room.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.059
Thank you, sir.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.311
You're coming with me, boy.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.607
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is here.
Get back, Satan, get back there.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.693
Jesus love and Jesus Man.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.279
Jesus, Jesus, promised land.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.364
Whoo! A-hoo.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.515
<i>♪ Day by day, day by day ♪</i>

05:08.975 --> 05:12.562
I just want a decent, normal church.
Is that too much to ask?

05:12.645 --> 05:16.399
You had a perfectly good church
and you were disloyal to it.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.694
Reverend Stroup was the one
who was disloyal, not me.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.612
Me, I don't go to church.

05:21.904 --> 05:22.989
Church goes with me.

05:23.406 --> 05:28.703
I'm worshipping when I'm drinking a beer,
digging a hole or fishing for trout.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.205
Wow, that's beautiful, Lucky.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.167
Luanne, I happen to know it's asinine.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.962
Hank, we have no choice.
It is time to try the megachurch.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.922
You know, the preacher
used to be a quarterback

05:40.006 --> 05:41.382
for the Texas Longhorns.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.677
Yeah, and I still don't want to go.
That ought to tell you something.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.888
Fine, we won't go to any church.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.098
You and I and our son

05:49.182 --> 05:52.310
will live the barren, empty lives
of secular humanists.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.936
Dad.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.491
Well, I guess I can understand
buying coffee in church,

06:06.574 --> 06:10.328
but do you really think
Jesus recommends Nat King Cole?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.163
Chai Tea Latte
for Reverend Stroup.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.958
God bless you...
Wait, is there cinnamon in there?

06:16.042 --> 06:18.669
Reverend Stroup?
What the heck is she doing here?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.380
Do you think she's looking for us?

06:20.463 --> 06:22.715
This is gonna be so freaking awkward.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.801
Pretend we're buying a travel mug.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.637
-We don't use the ones we've got.
-Pretend, Hank.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.514
She's coming this way.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.557
Oh, I can't be here for this.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.685
Hank? Peggy?

06:34.769 --> 06:37.647
Reverend Stroup.
Uh, it, it's Sunday morning.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.816
Shouldn't you be over at First Methodist?

06:39.899 --> 06:43.403
Well, I just popped over before services
for a coffee and a cruller.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.571
They're free to all local clergy.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.448
Why are you here?

06:47.532 --> 06:51.411
We've, uh, well, you know,
been trying out a few churches.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.870
Trying out?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.997
Is, is this over the seats?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.249
You've got to be kidding.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.669
First, you ignore my idea
about open mic Sundays,

06:59.752 --> 07:01.546
then you take away our seats.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.256
You reap what you sow, Reverend.

07:03.339 --> 07:06.467
If you want a pastry
or some Christian-themed paper goods,

07:06.551 --> 07:07.844
you can't beat this place,

07:07.927 --> 07:11.681
but you can't seriously be thinking
of worshipping at this behemoth.

07:11.764 --> 07:12.723
Now, hold on.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.643
Just because a place is big,
doesn't mean it's bad.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.478
The Pentagon's good.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.814
Hank, it's times like these,

07:19.897 --> 07:22.775
I like to ask myself,
"What would Jesus do?"

07:22.859 --> 07:25.945
And you know what He'd do, Hank?
He would grow up.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.198
You know what, Reverend?

07:29.282 --> 07:32.243
I'm glad I ran into you
so I could tell you to your face.

07:32.326 --> 07:35.580
We're switching to this church,
and we're never coming back.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.914
Just for the record,

07:36.998 --> 07:40.501
the Smiths have been sitting
in your seats every week since you left,

07:40.585 --> 07:41.919
and they sing.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.680
<i>The tram
to the sanctuary is now boarding.</i>

07:52.763 --> 07:54.932
<i>Parishioners,
please keep your arms and legs</i>

07:55.016 --> 07:56.309
<i>inside the vehicle.</i>

07:56.893 --> 07:58.269
Oh, God.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.110
What have I gotten us into?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.490
Oh, I recognize that look.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.534
You either just got mugged
or you're first-timers.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.078
I'm Bryce Carmody,
the liaison for new members.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.748
I see you already enjoyed
our coffee bar. How is it?

08:18.831 --> 08:19.999
Uh... it's good.

08:20.082 --> 08:23.127
So, would you say you were satisfied
or extremely satisfied?

08:23.211 --> 08:26.756
Well, I guess I'd say
I'm extremely satisfied.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.549
What's that?

08:28.633 --> 08:31.219
That is our renowned youth handbell choir.

08:31.302 --> 08:34.347
They have played at halftime
of the Nokia Sugar Bowl.

08:34.430 --> 08:37.266
And they're always looking
for a new pair of hands.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.187
Uh... there's a grown-up in charge, right?

08:41.270 --> 08:44.190
You don't just leave kids alone
with a bunch of bells?

08:44.273 --> 08:46.984
Absolutely. Mrs. Porter
watches those kids like a hawk.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.780
I want to make it clear
that we're just looking.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.199
We sort of had a falling out
with our old church

08:53.282 --> 08:55.493
because of a situation with our pews.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.578
Boy, do I understand situations.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.706
A few years ago, I made top salesman
at McNabb Motors.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.918
The one thing people don't realize
about car dealerships is

09:04.001 --> 09:06.921
the easy access to cocaine. Whoo.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.006
But God was still looking out for me.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.260
Sent my wife to taser me
in the shower. Praise the Lord.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.762
Of course, then my wife was tempted,

09:14.845 --> 09:16.806
you know, by the company of other men.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.766
Bryce, um, I'm glad I ran into you.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.727
We got a situation with a hostile goose
in the parking lot.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.770
I'm on it,

09:23.479 --> 09:25.439
You folks looked like
you needed some rescuing.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.192
Bryce can get a little too enthusiastic,
but he's a good man.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.735
You're Reverend Nealey.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.113
I recognize you from the bus benches.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.406
I am Peggy Hill.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.949
This is my husband, Hank.

09:37.660 --> 09:42.164
It's TV the way
I always dreamed TV could be.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.749
High def.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.418
We televise services on it.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.713
And then, afterwards, we've been known
to leave it on for the Cowboy game.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.425
Well, we better hurry up
if we want to get good seats.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.469
No need to rush. The seating's assigned.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.015
I think we've found a new home.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.393
Uh, Nealey.

10:02.476 --> 10:03.769
Okay, just calm down.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.230
Why don't you just order
the bigger envelopes?

10:06.314 --> 10:09.609
This is the same thing we went
through with the cups. What?

10:09.692 --> 10:12.570
How could you schedule carpet cleaning
on Sunday morning?

10:12.653 --> 10:14.196
What do you think we're doing here?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.616
Hmm. May I make a suggestion?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.200
I would welcome it.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.952
You need help.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.540
Well, I admit I was skeptical at first,

10:24.624 --> 10:28.711
but that church really understands
the concept of customer service.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.629
Check this out.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.882
Eh. What's that alien
transponder-like device?

10:32.965 --> 10:37.720
Bryce Carmody, the new member honcho,
is a manager at Rattlers Steakhouse.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.263
He gives 'em out to church members.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.558
It vibrates and lights up
whenever there's important church news.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.270
It's like being paged by God
without being killed.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.980
Why don't y'all come next Sunday?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.774
I'll be honest with you, Hank.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.567
You leaving Arlen First Methodist

10:51.651 --> 10:53.527
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.489
Stroup is so desperate to keep
members from jumping ship,

10:56.572 --> 10:59.283
she turned the last two pews
into a smoking section.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.952
Yeah. Who knows how far
she'll go to keep us?

11:02.036 --> 11:03.788
When I hugged her after the service,

11:03.871 --> 11:06.248
I lingered a little
and I was not rebuffed.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.709
Oh. There it goes.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.836
I better get on the horn with Bryce.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.589
Hey, Bryce, what's up?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.550
The sermon? Extremely satisfied.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.429
The Rattlers Steakhouse disc?
Extremely satisfied.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.058
I'll tell you
who's not extremely satisfied.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.435
The Lord. With Uncle Hank.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.689
And when he gets unsatisfied, he smites.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.023
Now, baby doll,

11:31.107 --> 11:34.026
we should be tolerant
of other people's religion.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.986
I guess you're right.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.614
Where are you and God gonna be today?

11:38.698 --> 11:41.742
Getting a fuel filter
for my truck at Western Auto.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.508
Now, with our volume in communion wafers,

11:57.591 --> 11:59.385
I thought the price
would be more competitive.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.346
Oh. Uh... Could you hold? Yes?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.932
Oh, uh, I'll try and transfer you.
Uh, oh...

12:06.058 --> 12:07.768
Peace be with you. Please hold.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.395
Peace be with you, please hold.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.105
About those communion wafers.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.482
Yeah, we want the same price
you give the Baptists.

12:14.108 --> 12:14.942
Done.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.152
Thank you, Peggy.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.487
You are a gift straight from heaven.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.780
I really am.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.782
You know, Reverend Stroup never got that.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.619
All right, Apostles, let's huddle up.

12:25.703 --> 12:29.248
Bryce, I think I can get deep
on old Ace Bandage over there.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.500
Dear Lord, we ask you
to watch over this play.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.418
Oh.

12:32.501 --> 12:36.630
Oh, I thought we were covered
by the pre-game prayer. Sorry.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.342
So Nancy was talking
with Don Ringles,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.970
the sportscaster at channel 84.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.514
Guess which NFC starting quarterback

12:45.598 --> 12:46.599
is gay.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.518
Now, it's not who you think.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.563
Hey, Bryce. Another survey, huh?

12:53.063 --> 12:55.816
Well, let's see, uh, extremely satisfied.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.278
Condition of the field,
extremely satisfied.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.573
Overall experience, uh...

13:03.199 --> 13:04.366
Satisfied.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.285
Uh, just satisfied.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.955
Well, I guess I deserve that
for having spent 13 years dealing weed

13:10.039 --> 13:11.207
out of my grandmother's house.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.127
Uh, you know, I just got home from work,

13:15.211 --> 13:16.712
and I'm not thinking clearly.

13:16.796 --> 13:20.800
Uh, you know, remembering back,
I was extremely satisfied.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.927
-Great. See you in an hour.
-Huh?

13:23.010 --> 13:23.969
The woodworking club.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.472
They get together every Tuesday, Thursday,
Saturday and Sunday.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.307
<i>I knew you'd want to check it out.</i>

13:31.685 --> 13:35.105
Reverend Nealey. Oh, no.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.732
I'm very sorry to hear that.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.859
Your mother was one
of my favorite parishioners.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.903
Sign here, here, here and here.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.113
Um, Peggy, I'm on the phone.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.323
Oh. Oh, sorry.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.535
Sign here, here, here and here.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.248
No, it's okay.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.834
-You cry if you need to.
-Hey.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.252
Which one do you like better?

13:56.877 --> 14:00.256
This is an extremely personal matter
about one of our members.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.508
Oh, of course.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.560
I can't wait to get home
and have a beer in the alley.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.895
You know, I'll bet Dale
has an interesting take

14:14.979 --> 14:16.397
on that new super-flu.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.653
Come on, everyone.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.822
Hop on board for the midnight movie.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.367
You love movies, Hank.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.923
I say,

14:43.007 --> 14:46.552
even beaten to a pulp,
Jim Caviezel is one handsome man.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.554
I feel kind of dizzy.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.972
Me too.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.267
It's 2:00 in the morning.
We've been here over 16 hours.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.894
Well, let's go home and go to bed.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.687
Church starts in six hours.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.403
Peggy, we need to talk
about the new church.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.655
I think things are moving a little fast.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.284
I know. After years of being ignored
by Reverend Stroup,

15:10.367 --> 15:15.539
in just a few days, I have become a player
in the ninth biggest church in Texas.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.207
Well, I'm glad for you and all,

15:17.291 --> 15:20.169
but we haven't had
any family or friend time.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.504
I haven't been in the alley in three days.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.506
God knows what's been going on there.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.509
Oh, Hank, come on, honey,
the sky's getting light, go to sleep.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.511
We'll talk about it on the way to church.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.391
Huh.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.857
Clergy business. Please step aside.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.905
You know, uh, I didn't get much sleep.
I, I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.841
<i>♪ Do you wanna drink? ♪</i>

16:08.550 --> 16:12.680
Yes, Bocephus, I am most definitely
ready for some football.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.890
Hey, Uncle Hank.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.935
You scared the bejesus out of me, Lucky.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.061
I thought you were Peggy.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.022
Monday Night Football's
on Sunday now, too?

16:22.398 --> 16:23.315
Sweet.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.110
Say, aren't you supposed to be in church?

16:26.193 --> 16:27.861
Well, I'm fed up with church.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.949
My old one didn't pay any attention to me
and my new one won't leave me alone.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.868
You need to get in touch with God,
not church.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.454
-You know what I mean?
-Uh, kind of.

16:37.538 --> 16:41.333
Yep, I find that sometimes
church just gets in the way.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.586
That's why I have my own services
at the Point After Lounge.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.754
Want to come with?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.507
I don't know if I can go to a bar
on Sunday morning.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.135
Look at your TV reception, friend.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.805
I think the Lord is trying to tell you
to go to the Point After.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.851
Mic check, mic check.
Testing one, two, three.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.646
Before I introduce Reverend Nealey,
I have a few announcements.

17:02.730 --> 17:08.110
If anyone taped last week's <i>Amazing Race,</i>
please drop the tape off at my office.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.530
And nobody talk about it until I see it.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.740
That's enough.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.493
<i>♪ Baby, come back ♪</i>

17:17.369 --> 17:20.205
<i>♪ You can blame it all on me ♪</i>

17:20.497 --> 17:22.124
<i>♪ I was wrong ♪</i>

17:22.458 --> 17:25.669
<i>♪ And I just can't live without you ♪</i>

17:29.548 --> 17:31.884
Hey, Aunt Peggy. Baby doll.

17:31.967 --> 17:32.926
Lucky.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.137
Where have you been?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.766
I was going to call the police,
but I don't know your last name.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.850
Where have you been?

17:39.933 --> 17:43.437
Uh, we were at the, uh,
the Point After Lounge.

17:43.520 --> 17:47.274
They make a French dip
stuffed with a whole pound of roast beef.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.695
I was, uh, trying out Lucky's way
of worshipping.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.199
It's, uh, kind of...
I guess you'd call it lax.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.911
Anyway, it's not a stretch
that you might end up in a bar.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.996
Here's the thing.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.665
I'm done with church. Period.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.875
Sorry, Lucky.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.462
Well, thank you for at least giving my way
some consideration.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.713
I am not hearing this.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.217
If you don't go to church,
you'll go to hell.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.385
You don't think Lucky's going to hell,
do you?

18:15.469 --> 18:18.138
Lucky is true to his faith.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.224
You are a apostate.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.726
It's a Bible-study word
for you'll go to Hell.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.269
I rebuke you, Hank.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.606
Um, I'm having a little trouble
standing up.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.941
You can keep being mad at me,

18:29.024 --> 18:31.902
but I'm just gonna sit down
and rest my eyes.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.908
Consider this an intervention.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.912
Reverend Nealey is here
to make you come to your senses, Hank.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.706
Please don't take this the wrong way,
Reverend,

18:44.790 --> 18:47.751
but I, I don't want to go
to your church anymore.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.213
I must admit, I'm a little surprised.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.258
I was getting reports from Bryce
that you were extremely satisfied.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.177
And I was for a little while,
but your church,

18:57.261 --> 19:00.180
no offense, it just keeps coming at you.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.348
I understand, Hank.

19:01.431 --> 19:05.018
See, I went to a big state school
with a lot of options and activities,

19:05.102 --> 19:06.186
and that was good for me,

19:06.270 --> 19:08.438
but some people want to go somewhere
a little smaller.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.941
I'm guessing that's what your old church
was like.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.277
-Yeah.
-Maybe that's where you belong.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.280
I can't tell you what play to call, Hank,

19:16.530 --> 19:18.991
but I know someone
who might have an opinion.

19:19.074 --> 19:22.119
Yes, and my opinion
is that Hank should suck it up

19:22.202 --> 19:24.288
and stay at our wonderful new church.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.165
I don't belong there, Peggy.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.793
But I can't go back to Reverend Stroup
with my tail between my legs.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.880
The Lord will help you find a way
to get back to your old church,

19:32.963 --> 19:35.757
and He will probably insist
that Peggy go with you.

19:35.841 --> 19:39.052
Oh, now, Reverend,
I can't leave you like that, you need me.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.014
-My loss.
-No. No. We'll think of something.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.390
This does not have to be goodbye.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.474
Yes, it does.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.976
-Pray on it, Hank.
-Wha...

19:54.735 --> 19:55.861
Megachurch...

19:55.944 --> 19:57.613
Extremely satisfied...

19:57.696 --> 19:59.990
Stroup... pews...

20:02.284 --> 20:03.660
Thank you, God.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.500
Hank. You came back.

20:10.584 --> 20:14.671
Yeah, uh, it seems that God thinks
I should be here.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.048
God knows best.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.925
That's why he's God.

20:18.008 --> 20:21.595
And He would want me to forgive you
and welcome you back.

20:21.678 --> 20:25.724
Yep. Oh, and by the way,
that's where God wants me to sit.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.852
Uh, where are the Smiths?

20:28.936 --> 20:32.522
Well, it seems they found out
the megachurch has day care,

20:32.606 --> 20:34.983
a movie club, and Bible bingo.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.318
Oh, really?

20:36.401 --> 20:40.239
Yeah, that place is good for them,
but we really like it here.

20:40.572 --> 20:44.660
That is, unless we have to worry
about our seats being taken every week.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.995
I can't promise anything, Hank.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.790
Well, I can't promise you
Bill won't find out

20:49.873 --> 20:52.584
that the megachurch
has Christian speed dating.

20:52.668 --> 20:56.129
And Dale and Boomhauer
love to ride on trams.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.134
Welcome back, Hank.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.679
Please take...

21:03.762 --> 21:05.389
...your seat.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.853
Good to see you again, Lord.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.394
-
