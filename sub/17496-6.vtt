WEBVTT

00:06.959 --> 00:10.124
Previously on Mars.

00:10.125 --> 00:11.999
When you believe
in a goal the way we believed

00:12.000 --> 00:15.165
in Mars, conviction alone
will sustain you through

00:15.166 --> 00:17.791
almost any test.

00:17.792 --> 00:18.999
Robert!

00:19.000 --> 00:22.791
If you find evidence
of a second genesis.

00:22.792 --> 00:25.290
Evolution can begin again.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.332
I've got faith.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.207
You know,
I used to stand in the doorway

00:29.208 --> 00:31.165
of the farmhouse where I
grew up looking at all of the

00:31.166 --> 00:33.874
crops, thinking about
all the people they'd feed.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.457
If you push too hard too fast,

00:35.458 --> 00:37.791
something's gonna break.

00:37.792 --> 00:41.542
If they fail, everyone's out.

00:42.291 --> 00:45.040
But faith
doesn't guarantee success.

00:45.041 --> 00:48.374
Without plants we're nothing.

00:48.375 --> 00:52.583
The real test is
what happens when you fail.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.582
Richardson, Leslie.

02:17.583 --> 02:23.125
Phase 2, personal entry.

02:51.792 --> 02:55.333
Damn tragedy.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.000
God.

03:07.208 --> 03:12.041
The entire
west section is destroyed.

03:34.333 --> 03:37.666
Paul was always late.

03:37.667 --> 03:41.165
He would get so caught up
in his work that he would

03:41.166 --> 03:45.375
just lose time,
completely forget about it.

03:50.250 --> 03:54.999
And then he would show
up hours later, filthy,

03:55.000 --> 03:56.666
like a kid that had
been playing out in the

03:56.667 --> 03:59.666
mud all day.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.374
And always with that
look on his face,

04:02.375 --> 04:07.999
that look as if he knew
that he was in trouble.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.541
But it was all worth it.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.999
There was this one
night I remember,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.040
It was while we were living
out in South America,

04:16.041 --> 04:20.708
he was still in the
forest collecting samples.

04:20.709 --> 04:24.874
He was late, as usual.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.749
But somehow it was different.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.416
Morning came.

04:30.417 --> 04:33.207
Another day went by.

04:33.208 --> 04:37.416
Finally I could hear
his footsteps approaching.

04:37.417 --> 04:42.458
So, I rushed out to meet him.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.541
And all of the sudden all of
that fear and worry that I'd

04:46.542 --> 04:52.291
felt turned into anger, rage.

04:56.417 --> 05:02.625
I couldn't believe
how selfish he'd been.

05:02.917 --> 05:07.291
And then he appeared.

05:08.417 --> 05:11.291
Victor.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.499
There he is.

05:15.500 --> 05:21.166
Covered
from top to bottom in mud.

05:27.125 --> 05:31.166
With that look on his face...

05:36.125 --> 05:40.375
that look.

05:43.625 --> 05:48.166
And all I could say was,

05:54.625 --> 05:58.417
"I love you."

06:02.208 --> 06:07.208
Without plants we're nothing.

06:08.375 --> 06:14.041
We are not nothing, my friend.

06:46.917 --> 06:49.499
We'd lost seven of our own.

06:49.500 --> 06:54.458
The lab and the
greenhouse were destroyed.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.207
Olympus Town was on complete
lock down until the nations of

06:58.208 --> 07:02.166
the IMSF decided on the
fate of our mission.

07:02.208 --> 07:05.708
Was Mars going to be
a giant leap forward,

07:05.709 --> 07:08.207
or just a passing novelty.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.874
It wasn't the first
time humankind had

07:09.875 --> 07:12.583
faced this question.

07:23.959 --> 07:26.958
We accomplished
the impossible by

07:26.959 --> 07:29.874
stepping on the Moon.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.040
This was, the first hop.

07:32.041 --> 07:35.541
And there would be a skip,
and a jump afterwards.

07:35.542 --> 07:39.416
And we'd keep going
and going and going,

07:39.417 --> 07:43.542
and the future would be
one of endless possibilities,

07:43.583 --> 07:47.124
where the Cosmos was ours.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.582
What do you think
about this Moon landing?

07:48.583 --> 07:50.916
Well it's the
beginning of a new frontier,

07:50.917 --> 07:52.916
a gateway to Mars.

07:52.917 --> 07:56.249
That came to a very abrupt halt.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.749
A major
turning point for Apollo was

07:58.750 --> 08:01.624
the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.332
Alright Houston,
we've got a problem.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.457
There is a
bulletin from ABC news.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.791
The Apollo 13 spacecraft
has had a serious

08:07.792 --> 08:09.582
power supply malfunction.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.082
A late report says the
spacecraft now is operating

08:12.083 --> 08:15.000
on battery power alone,
all unnecessary equipment

08:15.001 --> 08:17.916
is being turned off.

08:17.917 --> 08:19.582
Let's everybody keep cool.

08:19.583 --> 08:23.666
Let's not make it
any worse by guessing.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.250
We came
close to losing astronauts.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.124
And it scared the
living daylights out

08:28.125 --> 08:30.165
of lots of people.

08:30.166 --> 08:33.624
And some leaders at NASA
said we gotta stop this.

08:33.625 --> 08:37.666
This is too risky.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.666
We all lived
through that in real time.

08:40.667 --> 08:45.375
We were all wrapped up with
the fate of the astronauts.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.290
It was a close call
to get them back and that

08:49.291 --> 08:52.290
really spooked Nixon.

08:52.291 --> 08:55.165
It soured him on the
notion of sending humans away

08:55.166 --> 08:57.541
from Earth into deep space.

08:57.542 --> 09:01.791
So it was a catalytic
turning point in attitudes

09:01.792 --> 09:03.791
towards space exploration.

09:03.792 --> 09:06.874
Jack and
Fred and I are very proud and

09:06.875 --> 09:09.165
glad to be back
here in Texas tonight.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.000
There were times when
we really didn't think that

09:12.001 --> 09:13.541
we'd make it back here.

09:13.542 --> 09:16.165
After the anomaly on 13,

09:16.166 --> 09:19.207
I thought that our
space exploration would

09:19.208 --> 09:21.040
continue to go.

09:21.041 --> 09:24.165
But the extreme rate of
progress slowed down.

09:24.166 --> 09:26.000
Apollo was this massive promise

09:26.001 --> 09:27.874
of what was going
to be going on, right?

09:27.875 --> 09:30.749
We were going to the
Moon, not to stop.

09:30.750 --> 09:35.332
There were plans beyond the
Moon but all this got killed

09:35.333 --> 09:40.750
as the political will
petered out and was gone.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.833
On a Mars
mission there may be some loss

09:44.834 --> 09:47.541
of life in the process,
there may be failures along

09:47.542 --> 09:50.834
the road, but
people will take it on.

09:50.875 --> 09:54.541
One of the things that you
have to ask is: 'Are the rest of

09:54.542 --> 09:56.582
us willing to allow
them to do that?'

09:56.583 --> 10:00.249
Space exploration is
subject to public opinion,

10:00.250 --> 10:01.874
and political support.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.541
There's no question about that.

10:03.542 --> 10:06.582
If you send astronauts
to Mars and they die there,

10:06.583 --> 10:09.040
I guarantee you, public
opinion will prohibit you from

10:09.041 --> 10:13.125
ever doing it again.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.582
As we buried our friends,

10:21.583 --> 10:24.249
the fate of the mission was
back on Earth in the hands of

10:24.250 --> 10:28.792
my sister and the IMSF.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.416
Hi Ed.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.582
How long until we know?

10:51.583 --> 10:54.249
I told the
press everything I know;

10:54.250 --> 10:56.582
The nations are meeting to
discuss how to proceed and

10:56.583 --> 10:58.416
then we'll make an
official announcement.

10:58.417 --> 11:00.749
You can't let them give up.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.916
You just can't.

11:02.917 --> 11:08.667
They knew something like this
was a possibility, we all did.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.332
Seven of
the world's most beloved

11:11.333 --> 11:14.290
scientists and
astronauts are dead.

11:14.291 --> 11:16.499
Does that mean anything to you?

11:16.500 --> 11:18.124
Of course it
means something to me.

11:18.125 --> 11:21.290
What are you talking about?

11:21.291 --> 11:25.124
It's a time to be strong, to
make a statement that says

11:25.125 --> 11:26.833
we're here to stay.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.666
You're not going
to influence my recommendation

11:28.667 --> 11:30.124
to the committee.

11:30.125 --> 11:31.624
We've come too far Joon.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.290
If the train is derailing,

11:33.291 --> 11:36.457
there's nothing I can do
to keep it on the tracks.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.207
The nations respect you,

11:38.208 --> 11:40.290
they will listen to you;

11:40.291 --> 11:44.124
You can inspire them
to stay the course.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.040
Even if we can Ed,

11:46.041 --> 11:48.040
I'm not sure that we should.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.624
What?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.332
I'm not sure that we should.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.666
Me, I'm sure of one thing.

11:53.667 --> 11:57.709
I won't let go.

12:06.834 --> 12:10.165
Dreamers
of space have always had

12:10.166 --> 12:14.374
their eyes, their hopes,
their aspirations,

12:14.375 --> 12:17.833
on getting to Mars.

12:17.834 --> 12:20.165
Mars has been the goal since.

12:20.166 --> 12:24.750
Wernher Von Braun
got involved with NASA.

12:28.208 --> 12:31.040
Liftoff, we have a liftoff!

12:31.041 --> 12:35.000
Von Braun
overbuilt entirely the rocket

12:35.041 --> 12:36.500
to go to the Moon.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.207
Saturn 5 is the
largest, longest,

12:39.208 --> 12:42.207
and heaviest machine
ever built by humans.

12:42.208 --> 12:45.207
It's absolute overkill
for going to the Moon.

12:45.208 --> 12:48.207
And the reason is, Von Braun
didn't wanna go to the Moon.

12:48.208 --> 12:50.374
He wanted to go to Mars.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.374
The only reason he got
involved in rocketry was

12:52.375 --> 12:54.874
because ever since
he's a little kid,

12:54.875 --> 12:58.624
he's focused on this
idea of getting to Mars.

12:58.625 --> 13:01.374
He invented the
V2 rocket when he was in

13:01.375 --> 13:03.541
his late twenties and
it was the first thing

13:03.542 --> 13:05.624
that ever went
into space from Earth.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.374
Von Braun surrenders
to US forces.

13:08.375 --> 13:11.207
He and his fellow rocket
scientists actually welcomed

13:11.208 --> 13:13.040
by the Americans.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.374
After the war,

13:14.375 --> 13:16.541
he writes a book
called 'das Marsprojekt',

13:16.542 --> 13:19.916
which is basically a manual
on how to build a fleet of

13:19.917 --> 13:23.916
ships that can get to Mars
and get humans back.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.457
He's worked out all the
equations, all the details,

13:26.458 --> 13:28.791
of how it could
actually be done.

13:28.792 --> 13:32.416
And it captured the
mind of the world.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.290
Nobody was thinking
about going to the Moon;

13:34.291 --> 13:39.166
They were all imagining
going to Mars.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.416
This closes a
golden chapter in the age

13:42.417 --> 13:44.916
of space exploration.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.749
At the
end of the Apollo program,

13:46.750 --> 13:48.791
NASA's beginning
to lose its focus:

13:48.792 --> 13:49.916
What do we do next?

13:49.917 --> 13:53.916
And there are two proposals
on Richard Nixon's desk.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.582
One proposal is that
we build a spaceplane,

13:57.583 --> 13:59.583
called the Space Shuttle.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.833
The other proposal was
from Von Braun and he was

14:01.834 --> 14:03.624
really storming
the halls of Congress,

14:03.625 --> 14:05.791
to say that we can go to Mars.

14:05.792 --> 14:08.457
When would
you see a man on Mars?

14:08.458 --> 14:10.624
We could land a man on Mars in

14:10.625 --> 14:12.833
a little over 10 years
if we really wanted to do it.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.791
Richard Nixon was never that

14:14.792 --> 14:16.624
big of a supporter
of the space program.

14:16.625 --> 14:19.457
He came in wanting to cut
the budget to lower taxes,

14:19.458 --> 14:21.624
and space just
was not a high priority

14:21.625 --> 14:23.207
for that administration.

14:23.208 --> 14:26.499
Basically they just wanted
fewer leaps for mankind, right?

14:26.500 --> 14:29.124
Small steps, small steps.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.499
So Nixon
chooses the Space Shuttle

14:31.500 --> 14:33.791
over going to Mars.

14:33.792 --> 14:37.124
Von Braun quits NASA,
and within a few years

14:37.125 --> 14:39.874
has cancer and dies.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.666
It must
have taken a great deal of

14:41.667 --> 14:44.207
determination to carry
on and, in view of some the

14:44.208 --> 14:45.833
early failures that you've had.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.708
Well, yes you just have to,

14:48.709 --> 14:52.207
shouldn't give up.
It's very simple,

14:52.208 --> 14:54.207
something blows in your face,

14:54.208 --> 14:56.000
try again, try again, try again.

14:56.001 --> 14:59.917
One fine day you'll
wind up on top.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.332
After the
devastation to the west section

15:06.333 --> 15:10.332
we needed to scavenge from
our other resources to rebuild,

15:10.333 --> 15:13.458
even the old workshop.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.333
Figure
we use the housings to patch

15:22.375 --> 15:25.541
the corridor the best we can.

15:25.542 --> 15:28.708
If we can get the
section sealed with scrap,

15:28.709 --> 15:32.249
my team can start
working on the damage done

15:32.250 --> 15:33.582
to Olympus Town.

15:33.583 --> 15:38.750
Javier!

15:39.709 --> 15:40.916
What?

15:40.917 --> 15:43.834
<i>Ven mira.</i>

15:47.625 --> 15:52.667
<i>Que, what is that,</i>

15:56.750 --> 15:59.958
corrosion?

15:59.959 --> 16:03.875
It looks like,
aragonite crystal.

16:04.917 --> 16:07.582
Possible the metal catalyzed

16:07.583 --> 16:10.916
perculate carried by the storm?

16:10.917 --> 16:13.416
Unless
something reacted with the

16:13.417 --> 16:18.624
water that came out of
the condensation filter.

16:18.625 --> 16:22.834
It would be nice if I had a lab.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.499
It's getting dark.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.166
Let's get out of here.

16:38.917 --> 16:42.249
Phobos and Deimos.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.667
Fear and terror,

16:45.291 --> 16:48.958
good names for
the Moons of Mars.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.165
We lost
two of our finest cosmonauts

16:51.166 --> 16:52.999
to this catastrophe;

16:53.000 --> 16:56.124
The support of the
Russian people is fading.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.999
We've known this since Apollo:

16:58.000 --> 17:02.457
Once the novelty passes,
so does public support,

17:02.458 --> 17:04.833
and no one ever
died on the Moon.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.708
Is this not
the time to make a statement

17:06.709 --> 17:10.124
that we're here to stay?

17:10.125 --> 17:14.375
We have committed resources,
delivered speeches.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.999
Giving up now could be
a great embarrassment.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.540
More embarrassing than

17:19.541 --> 17:21.624
another tragedy?

17:21.625 --> 17:23.833
We only accepted the risk
in the 60s because it was a

17:23.834 --> 17:26.833
matter of national defense.

17:26.834 --> 17:28.959
People love space,

17:29.001 --> 17:32.666
but not when it means
watching heroes die.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.874
Secretary Seung,

17:34.875 --> 17:38.332
you are as personally
invested as any of us.

17:38.333 --> 17:43.041
I would like to hear your
recommendation to the committee.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.917
May I?

18:15.083 --> 18:17.959
I'm so sorry.

18:19.208 --> 18:21.207
Paul was my responsibility.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.749
We don't need to do this.

18:23.750 --> 18:28.040
They all were.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.457
You didn't kill them and

18:30.458 --> 18:33.458
neither did Paul.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.874
And neither did you.

18:36.875 --> 18:40.374
I gave that order, not you.

18:40.375 --> 18:44.249
We didn't have a choice Leslie.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.374
Paul was right in front of me

18:46.375 --> 18:50.249
and I didn't see him.

18:50.250 --> 18:53.249
If we have
any chance in this place

18:53.250 --> 18:57.625
we need you with us.

19:03.917 --> 19:08.291
Hana...

19:08.333 --> 19:12.749
they asked me to make a choice,

19:12.750 --> 19:16.834
whether to keep pushing,
or to bring you home.

19:17.917 --> 19:22.124
I tried to go
back to that feeling,

19:22.125 --> 19:24.332
that feeling we had,

19:24.333 --> 19:30.333
staring up at those stars
imagining what was beyond.

19:35.291 --> 19:38.457
Unnie, do you
remember that recurring dream

19:38.458 --> 19:40.457
I used to have?

19:40.458 --> 19:44.624
Walking along the regolith
under the twin Moons before

19:44.625 --> 19:51.208
I even knew it was
Mars I was dreaming about.

19:56.041 --> 20:00.499
When I think about you up there,

20:00.500 --> 20:05.375
if it had been you
in that corridor...

20:09.208 --> 20:13.207
If it had
been me in that corridor,

20:13.208 --> 20:18.165
I only hope someone else
would have done the same.

20:18.166 --> 20:23.499
This mission, it's
bigger than all of us.

20:23.500 --> 20:29.875
I've made my peace, and I'd
do it again if I have to.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.666
That dream I used
to have about Mars.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.582
I could never tell
Mom why I would wake up

20:39.583 --> 20:41.999
crying every time.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.625
It wasn't because
it was a nightmare.

20:47.166 --> 20:52.583
It was because the
dream was over.

20:53.208 --> 20:58.458
Hana, I told
them to bring you home.

21:00.208 --> 21:03.207
I'm going to make a public
announcement next week.

21:03.208 --> 21:07.166
I'm sorry.

21:13.917 --> 21:17.207
The mission had failed,

21:17.208 --> 21:23.959
I'd failed the crew,
I failed Ben.

22:21.125 --> 22:26.958
Man, this
reminds me of a place I used

22:26.959 --> 22:30.791
to go with my father
when I was a kid.

22:30.792 --> 22:33.000
So beautiful.

22:33.001 --> 22:36.457
Yeah.

22:36.458 --> 22:41.041
You know,
they can give us a rover;

22:41.625 --> 22:43.791
Put us in EVA suits,

22:43.792 --> 22:49.041
but that blue sky,
gonna miss that.

22:53.041 --> 22:56.624
There's really no way of
knowing if we actually make it

22:56.625 --> 22:59.417
up there, is there?

22:59.792 --> 23:04.375
Nope, but...

23:06.166 --> 23:10.542
What good would we
be if we didn't even try?

23:12.709 --> 23:17.375
Let's get moving.

23:41.166 --> 23:46.040
The tragedy,
for me, of the shuttle...

23:46.041 --> 23:48.708
it was as if we'd
lost our nerve.

23:48.709 --> 23:52.040
Instead of building on the
technology that had gotten us

23:52.041 --> 23:57.250
to the Moon, and saying
okay, let's go to Mars,

23:57.542 --> 24:04.207
we ended up to a shuttle
which was going nowhere.

24:04.208 --> 24:06.207
We went
into lower Earth orbit for

24:06.208 --> 24:07.874
the next forty years.

24:07.875 --> 24:11.541
And I think a lot people felt
a certain amount of betrayal.

24:11.542 --> 24:14.457
So far, the previous
generations since Apollo have

24:14.458 --> 24:19.333
not picked up that torch
and carried it forward.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.874
We're approaching the

24:21.875 --> 24:24.375
50th Anniversary of the
Apollo Moon landing.

24:24.417 --> 24:27.916
People who watched it happen
are still around and still

24:27.917 --> 24:31.416
remember a time when we
did things like this.

24:31.417 --> 24:35.124
And if anybody had told
me that I would be 64 and

24:35.125 --> 24:37.916
we wouldn't be on Mars,

24:37.917 --> 24:42.082
I would have thought
they were crazy.

24:42.083 --> 24:44.332
Dr. Zubrin,
you're mad that this vision

24:44.333 --> 24:46.082
has been stolen
from a generation?

24:46.083 --> 24:48.082
Yes, we turned our back on the

24:48.083 --> 24:49.749
whole Apollo vision.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.916
It's like Columbus coming
back from the New World and.

24:51.917 --> 24:53.416
Ferdinand and Isabella saying,

24:53.417 --> 24:55.416
"so what,
forget it, burn the ships."

24:55.417 --> 24:57.916
The purpose of space ships
is to actually travel across

24:57.917 --> 24:59.749
space and go to new worlds.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.916
Mars is where the science is,

25:01.917 --> 25:03.916
Mars is where the challenge is,

25:03.917 --> 25:06.332
and Mars is where the future is.

25:06.333 --> 25:10.791
That if we say no,
that is beyond us,

25:10.792 --> 25:13.624
then it would really indicate
that we have become less than

25:13.625 --> 25:16.290
the kind of people we used to
be and that is something that

25:16.291 --> 25:19.667
this country cannot afford.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.791
As the others
prepared Olympus Town for the

25:26.792 --> 25:30.541
official evacuation order,
Robert and I took a trip to

25:30.542 --> 25:35.542
visit an old friend, we needed
her help taking us back.

25:35.959 --> 25:39.250
There she is.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.457
Never thought we'd be trying

25:41.458 --> 25:43.791
to take her back.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.709
Me neither.

25:53.667 --> 25:57.332
It looks like she's
been through a war.

25:57.333 --> 26:00.040
She has.

26:00.041 --> 26:03.165
This is it, your
home for the seven-month

26:03.166 --> 26:07.374
journey and the first two
years you'll be living on Mars

26:07.375 --> 26:13.082
surface, when the time
comes to face the unknown,

26:13.083 --> 26:14.999
there has never been
another suit of armor more

26:15.000 --> 26:19.625
skillfully crafted
than this one.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.916
Take good care of her.

26:23.917 --> 26:27.750
She'll take good care of you.

27:16.417 --> 27:19.916
I want you to
stop and ask yourself what

27:19.917 --> 27:25.791
really is important
to you about this mission;

27:25.792 --> 27:28.416
And if the answer to
that question is not the most

27:28.417 --> 27:31.582
important thing in your life,
then I'm gonna invite you to

27:31.583 --> 27:35.666
walk out that door and pursue
that thing, whatever it is.

27:35.667 --> 27:39.249
And don't ever look back,
because no one will ever have

27:39.250 --> 27:43.875
the right to hold
it against you.

27:46.750 --> 27:52.333
Well alright, welcome home.

27:53.458 --> 27:58.417
External
solar arrays are online.

28:07.333 --> 28:11.000
Initializing
for start up on my mark...

28:11.001 --> 28:13.332
3, 2, 1.

28:13.333 --> 28:16.709
Engage.

28:18.959 --> 28:23.709
Pressurizing.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.457
No pressure now Hana,

28:26.458 --> 28:30.207
this is all of humanity
relying on you.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.958
You ready for this?

28:31.959 --> 28:32.999
Three.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.291
Are you?

28:34.333 --> 28:36.875
Two, one, ignition.

28:42.375 --> 28:47.542
Pressurization complete.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.332
NDEs are registering no

29:03.333 --> 29:05.666
micrometeoroid damage.

29:05.667 --> 29:09.499
She'll need the new parts to
address the damage from landing,

29:09.500 --> 29:11.165
but Cygnus brought
everything we need to

29:11.166 --> 29:15.917
get her flight-ready.

29:19.375 --> 29:23.040
How will it be?

29:23.041 --> 29:24.874
What's that?

29:24.875 --> 29:29.792
Going home.

29:32.041 --> 29:36.625
I'm already home.

29:54.875 --> 30:01.291
Marta...

30:02.583 --> 30:06.124
I thought you might
be interested in this.

30:06.125 --> 30:10.375
It was Paul's.

30:12.417 --> 30:17.500
I'd like you to have it.

30:31.792 --> 30:36.667
Is there anything
I can do to help?

30:51.333 --> 30:55.875
Thank you.

30:57.458 --> 30:59.624
When Paul was working on his

30:59.625 --> 31:01.708
early climate
resistant hybrid studies,

31:01.709 --> 31:06.040
I went with him to the
western highlands of Guatemala.

31:06.041 --> 31:09.124
We knew that if we didn't
plan our lives around our work

31:09.125 --> 31:11.791
we'd never see
each other at all.

31:11.792 --> 31:15.791
He was always gone,
sometimes weeks.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.624
Because on top of
his own research,

31:18.625 --> 31:21.040
he also decided that he could
figure out how this particular

31:21.041 --> 31:25.000
pathogen was spreading
through local communities,

31:25.001 --> 31:29.208
so I barely got to see him.

31:29.500 --> 31:33.499
And I resented him for it.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.332
It was as if, plants
were more important to him

31:36.333 --> 31:37.833
than human beings.

31:37.834 --> 31:42.750
Certainly to my mind,
more important than me.

31:43.750 --> 31:47.582
Eventually I understood
that for Paul,

31:47.583 --> 31:49.833
every time he looked
at those plants,

31:49.834 --> 31:54.666
he could see all the
people they could feed,

31:54.667 --> 31:59.500
all the people they could heal.

32:11.041 --> 32:13.749
So how did he figure it out?

32:13.750 --> 32:15.582
Figure what out?

32:15.583 --> 32:18.040
The pathogen.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.917
How was it spreading?

32:19.959 --> 32:22.207
Paul realized that the outbreak

32:22.208 --> 32:24.749
pattern followed the same
vectors as one of the airborne

32:24.750 --> 32:26.874
blights he'd been tracking.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.582
He'd also been mapping
these very complex wind flows

32:29.583 --> 32:31.916
from the mountains.

32:31.917 --> 32:36.541
And from that, he was able
to conclude that the pathogen

32:36.542 --> 32:39.708
must have mutated,
and it was able to survive

32:39.709 --> 32:44.207
in the air and travel on...

32:44.208 --> 32:47.124
The wind.

32:47.125 --> 32:50.667
Yeah.

32:56.083 --> 32:59.416
By executive order,
all non-evacuation related

32:59.417 --> 33:03.500
extra-vehicular activity
is now prohibited.

33:07.917 --> 33:11.500
The biggest
failure in history...

33:11.750 --> 33:14.082
biggest failure in history.

33:14.083 --> 33:15.791
It's easy...

33:15.792 --> 33:17.082
yeah, easy.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.749
Four years of my life...

33:18.750 --> 33:21.082
20 years preparing.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.249
Very good and it's over.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.166
Hey.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.791
We'd be
looking for another location

33:54.792 --> 33:57.666
with moisture to replicate
the reaction use on the WAVAR

33:57.667 --> 34:02.083
so we'd be following
the wind patterns.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.457
Wind patterns.

34:04.458 --> 34:06.040
Javier and I found something.

34:06.041 --> 34:09.165
The samples were too
contaminated to analyze but I

34:09.166 --> 34:12.666
figured it blew in from the
east in the storm because of

34:12.667 --> 34:18.125
the easterly arc of the wind,
no way to track its source.

34:18.833 --> 34:22.165
Your story made me think.

34:22.166 --> 34:26.000
Even though I may not be able
to pinpoint where it came from,

34:26.001 --> 34:30.331
I can figure out where
else it might have blown to.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.998
The way the Tharsis Plateau
affects the wind flow,

34:33.000 --> 34:34.833
it would have
blown straight into the

34:34.833 --> 34:36.873
recurring slope lineae.

34:36.875 --> 34:40.998
On these elevated bedrock
outcrops just to the west.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.165
If there wasn't a moratorium on

34:43.166 --> 34:46.666
nonessential EVAs...

34:46.667 --> 34:50.958
What moratorium?

35:01.875 --> 35:07.207
The history
of space exploration begins

35:07.208 --> 35:12.959
with individuals taking
the road not taken,

35:15.375 --> 35:17.874
with people with a vision.

35:17.875 --> 35:19.958
I really never had any doubts

35:19.959 --> 35:22.207
that it was possible
to go to the Moon.

35:22.208 --> 35:23.874
Today I know.

35:23.875 --> 35:27.749
People being
able to see with their minds

35:27.750 --> 35:32.375
what others had yet to be
able to see with their eyes.

35:32.917 --> 35:34.749
There is
a direct correlation between

35:34.750 --> 35:37.749
the dreams and the works
of science fiction

35:37.750 --> 35:39.749
and the reality.

35:39.750 --> 35:42.416
We as humans over and over
again create the future,

35:42.417 --> 35:44.249
we create the
future we envision.

35:44.250 --> 35:47.958
And then we bring to bear
our resources, our capital,

35:47.959 --> 35:49.791
our technology, our friendships,

35:49.792 --> 35:53.667
and then we make it real.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.499
What is this building called?

36:05.500 --> 36:07.124
This is the launch tower,

36:07.125 --> 36:11.166
so this is where the
astronauts would go up,

36:11.458 --> 36:14.083
and then there would be a big
arm that would swing over to

36:14.125 --> 36:18.791
the spacecraft, and then
they'd walk down the gangway,

36:18.792 --> 36:22.750
climb in the
spacecraft, go to space.

36:25.667 --> 36:30.041
This isn't floors, this is feet.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.958
The long-term goal of
SpaceX is to establish a

36:32.959 --> 36:36.040
self-sustaining
civilization on Mars.

36:36.041 --> 36:39.542
Pretty cool.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.624
It's always seemed like we
should have gone there by now,

36:43.625 --> 36:46.874
that's what everyone expected.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.374
We just kind of lost our way.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.708
It's a long way down.

36:51.709 --> 36:56.375
But now we're gonna
get back there.

36:57.001 --> 36:59.833
SpaceX Falcon 9 go for launch.

36:59.834 --> 37:02.040
Stage 1
tanks pressing for flight.

37:02.041 --> 37:04.666
Verify F9 is in startup.

37:04.667 --> 37:06.165
F9 is in startup.

37:06.166 --> 37:11.208
T-minus 4 minutes.

37:18.375 --> 37:21.165
SpaceX Falcon 9 go for launch.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.833
Vehicle's in manual.

37:22.834 --> 37:24.332
T-minus 1 minute.

37:24.333 --> 37:26.332
This is a
return to flight launch.

37:26.333 --> 37:30.917
We'd had a failed
mission on June 28 of 2015.

37:37.542 --> 37:41.040
After the failure, the whole
launch program ground to a halt.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.249
That obviously put a lot
of strain on the company.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.416
All stations
verify ready for launch.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.249
T-minus 30 seconds.

37:47.250 --> 37:50.582
Elon Musk
has said the key to get to Mars

37:50.583 --> 37:53.207
is the reusability of rockets.

37:53.208 --> 37:56.124
He wants to be able to
fire a rocket into orbit,

37:56.125 --> 37:59.582
launch a payload into space,
and then fire retro rockets

37:59.583 --> 38:04.582
and bring that rocket down to
land vertically, and reuse it.

38:04.583 --> 38:08.207
That's an extremely
difficult concept.

38:08.208 --> 38:12.958
If he cannot make rockets
truly reusable then he cannot

38:12.959 --> 38:15.959
launch a new
civilization on Mars.

38:19.583 --> 38:23.208
So the stakes for every
rocket launch are huge.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.749
T-minus 20 seconds.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.082
Stage Two tanks
pressing for flight.

38:27.083 --> 38:28.416
Flight computer has
control of the vehicle.

38:28.417 --> 38:30.249
Do we
see anything on the sensors

38:30.250 --> 38:31.416
that's a problem?

38:31.417 --> 38:32.916
No, nothing.

38:32.917 --> 38:35.125
They all say go for launch.

38:35.166 --> 38:39.166
T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

38:39.792 --> 38:45.166
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

39:00.792 --> 39:02.958
It's gone, baby.

39:02.959 --> 39:05.417
Let's go, check it out.

39:24.291 --> 39:28.624
Speed 1.2 kilometers down
range distance 11 kilometers.

39:28.625 --> 39:30.666
Shortly after main
engine cut off,

39:30.667 --> 39:32.624
we're going to
separate the stages and

39:32.625 --> 39:35.583
begin the second stage ignition.

39:38.458 --> 39:40.250
Come on.

39:46.834 --> 39:50.291
Main engine cut off.

39:50.709 --> 39:55.499
The first stage is returning
to land as the second stage

39:55.500 --> 39:59.874
powers the OrbComm satellites
to low Earth orbit.

39:59.875 --> 40:05.083
The fairings have
successfully deployed.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.332
The first stage will soon
begin its series of three

40:12.333 --> 40:16.166
burns to head back
towards Cape Canaveral.

40:20.333 --> 40:22.332
Where is it going?

40:22.333 --> 40:25.541
Okay, this is bad.

40:25.542 --> 40:28.917
Potentially bad.

40:43.625 --> 40:46.207
That is that first
stage, coming back down.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.208
History in the making guys.

41:10.917 --> 41:13.667
It's standing up!

41:14.291 --> 41:16.916
Coming in, it sounded
like an explosion.

41:16.917 --> 41:18.582
Yeah man!

41:18.583 --> 41:21.082
My God!

41:21.083 --> 41:22.457
Look at this, look at this!

41:22.458 --> 41:25.916
It's just sitting
there, look at that.

41:25.917 --> 41:29.500
What... holy smokes man.

41:35.333 --> 41:37.416
It's kind of amazing that
this window of opportunity

41:37.417 --> 41:41.000
is open for life
to go beyond Earth.

41:41.001 --> 41:42.249
And we just don't
know how long that window

41:42.250 --> 41:45.249
is going to be open.

41:45.250 --> 41:48.499
The thing that gets me
most fired up is that creating

41:48.500 --> 41:51.165
a self-sustaining
civilization on Mars would be

41:51.166 --> 41:53.666
the greatest adventure ever...

41:53.667 --> 41:55.499
ever in human history.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.791
It would be so exciting to
wake up in the morning and

41:58.792 --> 42:03.667
think that that's
what's happening.

42:04.709 --> 42:07.666
Apollo is
still within living memory.

42:07.667 --> 42:11.709
Houston the Eagle has landed.

42:12.542 --> 42:17.124
But the longer
we let it fade into the past,

42:17.125 --> 42:20.709
the dimmer our prospects become.

42:22.333 --> 42:25.374
We do need to make discoveries,

42:25.375 --> 42:29.040
we do need to find out
the truth about life,

42:29.041 --> 42:30.792
and the universe.

42:30.834 --> 42:33.833
To resolve mysteries that
thinking men and women have

42:33.834 --> 42:37.000
wondered about for
thousands of years.

42:37.001 --> 42:39.374
Look up, look up!

42:39.375 --> 42:42.207
There's everything out there!

42:42.208 --> 42:45.499
There's trillions
of other Earths.

42:45.500 --> 42:49.207
That's why we're gonna do
it and the next time we go,

42:49.208 --> 42:51.750
we're gonna go to stay.

42:56.041 --> 42:57.666
The story
Leslie Richardson told me

42:57.667 --> 42:59.249
sparked a thought.

42:59.250 --> 43:03.749
Javier and I found something
at the old workshop.

43:03.750 --> 43:07.083
I need to go there.

43:07.333 --> 43:09.249
The wind
patterns lead to a location

43:09.250 --> 43:11.834
87 kilometers west
of Olympus Town.

43:11.875 --> 43:13.874
We hoped to find a
new sample of the substance.

43:13.875 --> 43:15.708
Marta found on the WAVARs.

43:15.709 --> 43:20.040
Leslie, have
you ever driven one of these?

43:20.041 --> 43:23.374
No, I haven't.

43:23.375 --> 43:26.040
Do you want to have a go?

43:26.041 --> 43:28.750
Come.

43:30.709 --> 43:33.708
We're here at
IMSF headquarters waiting for.

43:33.709 --> 43:36.416
Secretary Seung to make her
announcement regarding what we

43:36.417 --> 43:40.291
believe will be the end
of the Mars mission.

43:49.709 --> 43:53.582
We've come so far,

43:53.583 --> 43:58.458
we stop now
the Mars dream is dead.

45:03.125 --> 45:07.874
Today marks the end of an era,

45:07.875 --> 45:11.875
and the beginning of a new one.

45:28.166 --> 45:31.333
There is life on Mars.

45:41.709 --> 45:45.917
We had come so far.

45:47.875 --> 45:51.583
Overcome so many obstacles.

45:53.750 --> 45:56.332
And though there were times
when our faith flagged,

45:56.333 --> 45:59.917
we persevered.

46:03.375 --> 46:08.207
There would be no evacuation.

46:08.208 --> 46:10.207
And as we prepared
for the next phase,

46:10.208 --> 46:12.874
one thing was clear.

46:12.875 --> 46:14.750
Our dream was alive.
