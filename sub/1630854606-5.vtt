00:13.013 --> 00:14.055
[camera shutter clicking]

00:14.139 --> 00:15.765
Hold that. Hold that.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.269
You're a natural, man.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.186
Wait.

00:25.775 --> 00:26.651
Yeah. Good.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.283
[in French] That's enough!

00:33.783 --> 00:35.118
You don't like it?

00:36.286 --> 00:37.495
[music continues playing]

00:38.621 --> 00:39.456
Yes.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.460
[in English] Give me some of that
strong business attitude.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.754
That's very good. Love it.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.548
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.800
-Okay, that's good.
-Okay.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.261
All right. We've got it. Thanks, everyone.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.346
Oh!

00:55.430 --> 00:56.431
<i>Bonjour,</i> Luc.

00:57.015 --> 00:57.849
Everyone…

00:57.932 --> 00:59.559
-Everyone looks so nice.
-[Luc] Yeah.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.727
Why are we taking pictures?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.604
For the press packet we are sending out.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.481
Oh. Um…

01:04.564 --> 01:06.649
Shouldn't I be having my photo taken too?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.236
Perhaps you should ask Sylvie.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.948
Yeah, Emily,
you're not officially part of the company

01:14.032 --> 01:15.658
until your work visa's approved.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.703
I've been filling out
tons of paperwork for you,

01:18.787 --> 01:20.663
which is the last thing I want to do.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.046
Is there anything I can do to help?

01:28.129 --> 01:31.007
I have to write a letter
arguing why you're so exceptional

01:31.091 --> 01:33.134
-no French person could do your job.
-Well--

01:33.760 --> 01:35.804
Don't say your Instagram account.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.764
That'd be more likely to get you deported.

01:37.847 --> 01:41.726
So, until your visa's approved,
you'll make a low base salary

01:41.810 --> 01:44.145
and you have
to earn the rest in commissions.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.980
You're paying me like a car salesperson?

01:46.064 --> 01:48.817
No, I'm paying you
like an American without a work visa.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.568
You eat what you kill.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.278
But you're resourceful,

01:52.362 --> 01:54.364
and I'm confident you can make it work.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.533
Okay, listen up, everyone.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.576
Hi.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.247
So those press packets
are going out to our former clients

02:02.330 --> 02:03.915
and the people we already know.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.795
But, the survival of the company
depends on attracting new clients.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.046
I have ideas for socials.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.381
Okay, get me a proposal.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.342
What I really want
is to get onto La Liste.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.761
That would raise
the visibility of the company

02:16.845 --> 02:18.930
and legitimize me as its head.

02:19.013 --> 02:23.434
So let's see which one of you can
get me an interview with Janine Dubois.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.231
Janine Dubois,
that name sounds so familiar.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.149
'Course it does.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.360
Janine Dubois writes a monthly column
in the newspaper <i>Le Monde</i>

02:32.443 --> 02:34.445
about the "10 Faces Changing Paris."

02:34.529 --> 02:35.738
Everyone reads it.

02:35.822 --> 02:40.994
We're always trying to get our clients
on La Liste, it's impossible.

02:41.077 --> 02:41.911
She's a bitch.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.621
I knew it! She follows me.

02:44.914 --> 02:45.790
She follows you?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.125
She follows her?

02:48.251 --> 02:50.086
Why don't you follow me, Emily?

03:01.556 --> 03:02.932
[upbeat music playing]

03:06.853 --> 03:07.979
Yeah, cheers for that.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.481
The table should be ready
in a couple of minutes.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.025
Mindy should be here by then.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.944
I was telling her about your new place,

03:15.028 --> 03:18.907
and we both think you should throw
a housewarming party on Saturday.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.575
You gonna show up this time?

03:21.576 --> 03:22.410
I promise.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.371
Let's blow it out.
Let's invite everyone we know in Paris.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.831
That's, like, eight people.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.835
Everyone knows a good party is
a 1-to-10 ratio of friends to strangers.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.880
Hello, <i>monsieur,</i> come to my party.
I've just moved to Paris.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.590
Go home, rosbif.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.258
Yeah, I'll see you there, mate.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.844
Roast beef? He'll definitely be there.

03:39.928 --> 03:40.803
Good chat, right?

03:41.888 --> 03:44.891
God, that's Nicolas de Leon.
He's one of the heads of JVMA.

03:44.974 --> 03:48.019
I met him at Pierre's retrospective.
He was surprisingly friendly.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.354
Surprisingly friendly?

03:49.854 --> 03:51.564
Should I be jealous, Cooper?

03:51.648 --> 03:54.525
The only interest I have in Nicolas
is strictly business.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.402
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.403
Hi.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.655
-Mwah!
-Mwah!

03:58.738 --> 03:59.614
[Alfie] All right.

04:00.114 --> 04:00.990
Oh, my God.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.159
Nicolas?

04:04.994 --> 04:06.079
Mindy Chen?

04:06.162 --> 04:07.747
-Stop.
-Hey.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.625
Hi. This is so crazy.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.378
Wait, I know you.
How do you guys know each other?

04:13.461 --> 04:14.504
-Roommates.
-Roommates.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.964
How do you know each other?

04:16.047 --> 04:19.342
We went to boarding school together
in Switzerland. Le Rosey.

04:19.425 --> 04:23.346
Mindy was this very naughty girl who
used to sell weed out of her dorm room.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.682
-Stop. You were the naughty one.
-Nah, it was you.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.226
-No, stop. You, so naughty.
-You know that it was…

04:28.893 --> 04:31.187
That's a whole lot of naughty going on.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.399
I'm sorry, this is my boyfriend Alfie.
Alfie, Nicolas.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.150
-Nice to meet you.
-You too, mate.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.903
I'm running super late.
How long are you in Paris?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.238
[in French] I live here now.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.155
I can't believe it!

04:41.239 --> 04:42.407
Oh, yes.

04:45.326 --> 04:48.246
[in English] Alfie's having a party
on Saturday. You should come.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.040
Yeah. No. No, yes.
But yes, you should come.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.959
-Call my office.
-Okay.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.253
-Mindy Chen.
-Nicolas de Leon.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.921
-I love it.
-Me too.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.131
-Okay, ciao.
-Bye.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.801
Okay. I literally cannot believe
you know Nicolas.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.720
Can't believe he's still so hot.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.806
All the girls were madly in love with him.
Including me.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.100
Also, it wasn't just weed.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.311
That's a story for another time.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.563
[Emily] I don't need
to hear those stories.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.690
-You really do.
-No, I really don't.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.866
[cheerful music playing]

05:38.755 --> 05:39.589
[gasps]

05:45.136 --> 05:46.137
[footsteps approaching]

05:46.846 --> 05:48.139
You free for lunch today?

05:48.222 --> 05:49.724
With you? <i>Non.</i>

05:50.224 --> 05:51.934
And Janine Dubois?

05:54.395 --> 05:57.357
Really? How did you manage to set that up?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.649
She follows me on Instagram.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.942
Janine Dubois follows you?

06:00.860 --> 06:01.861
[chuckles]

06:02.612 --> 06:05.740
Well, I guess all those endless selfies
are finally paying off.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.451
I'll take that as a "yes."

06:14.332 --> 06:15.958
Since Janine is <i>très</i> influential

06:16.042 --> 06:17.960
and decides who's who
in the cultural scene,

06:18.044 --> 06:19.629
I figured why not have her here

06:19.712 --> 06:21.923
so you and Chez Lavaux
can be on her radar.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.717
Thanks. I'll do my best to impress her.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.802
<i>Merci.</i>

06:25.885 --> 06:28.096
Do I seem nervous because I'm so nervous.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.599
Relax. You're <i>très</i> influential too.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.767
[chuckles softly]

06:34.477 --> 06:35.311
Emily.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.772
Oh, Janine. <i>Bonjour, enchantée.</i>

06:37.855 --> 06:38.856
How are you going?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.901
I've never been here before. Nice spot.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.653
You're not French?

06:43.736 --> 06:44.821
Australian.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.364
You're an expat too.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.367
I should've figured. I don't have
many French Instagram followers.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.035
Their loss. I've been following you

06:51.119 --> 06:53.955
since Brigitte Macron retweeted
your Vaga-Jeune campaign.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.249
I thought, now there's a kindred spirit.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.960
I thought I was gonna
get kicked out for that.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.254
No. You've got to give it back to them.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.589
It's the only way
you get respect around here.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.801
I really appreciate you
taking the time to talk to Sylvie.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.262
She's the kind of woman
I can only aspire to be.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.222
You're doing just fine being you.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.599
You're here on a work visa?

07:14.183 --> 07:16.269
Well, it's a tricky situation.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.980
How did you prove
you were so exceptional at your job

07:19.063 --> 07:20.565
that a French person couldn't do it?

07:21.315 --> 07:22.150
I didn't.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.569
I married one instead.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.946
Well, there's an idea.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.489
Something smells spectacular.

07:29.073 --> 07:32.160
Yes, I brought you here
because the food is extraordinary.

07:32.952 --> 07:33.995
<i>-Merci.</i>
<i>-Merci.</i>

07:34.078 --> 07:35.037
<i>Bonjour.</i>

07:35.121 --> 07:37.039
[in French] I'm Gabriel,
the chef here at Chez Lavaux.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.667
Janine Dubois. Lovely to meet you.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.170
Emily says your food is extraordinary.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.838
I'm prepared to be dazzled.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.090
I hope you will be.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.093
A little amuse-bouche. Asparagus velouté.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.266
Wow.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.851
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.520
[in English] So he's not just
<i>"le chef hot."</i> He can cook.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.688
Oh, yeah.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.150
I may have followed a link
from Emily's Instagram to your package.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.778
Marketing package.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.071
[chuckles]

08:09.197 --> 08:12.074
See. <i>Très</i> influential.
She's really good at what she does.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.577
Stop. Now I'm the one blushing.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.495
Enjoy.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.292
You've got the answer
to your visa problem right there.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.668
[chuckles]

08:23.586 --> 08:24.420
Janine.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.297
[in French] Sylvie Grateau.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.924
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.008
No apology necessary, Sylvie.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.510
So happy to meet you.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.638
I hope you don't mind
that we started without you.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.389
[in English] Of course not.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.351
-Are you English?
-She's from Australia.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.644
Oh.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.855
Well, for an Australian,
you certainly have the pulse of Paris.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.608
Sometimes it's easier
being on the outside looking in.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.652
-Right.
-Closest I've been to Australia

08:47.735 --> 08:49.070
is Outback Steakhouse.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.572
It was the special occasion restaurant
with my family.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.992
You have not lived
until you've tried their "bloomin' onion."

08:56.202 --> 08:58.996
Has Emily been regaling you
with her Chicago stories?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.748
Not yet.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.001
So… Where shall we begin?

09:04.085 --> 09:07.630
Well, maybe you could talk to me
a bit about how you opened the agency.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.632
What inspired you?

09:17.765 --> 09:19.350
[rock music playing]

09:19.934 --> 09:21.143
-[chattering indistinctly]
-Sorry.

09:22.937 --> 09:23.771
Oh, my God.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.658
There you are. Who are all these people?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.743
I invited the entire building.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.704
Hopefully, we don't run out of booze.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.331
I've got three kegs of beer,
one case of champagne

09:42.415 --> 09:45.084
and tons of bottles of Grey Goose
for my special martinis.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.420
Sounds like you have enough
for two buildings.

09:47.962 --> 09:48.879
Oh, my God!

09:49.422 --> 09:52.508
Nicolas de Leon actually showed up.
Excuse me.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.762
Nicolas, you made it.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.306
Yes. Thanks for inviting me.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.515
Of course.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.644
Mmm. Very nice.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.605
It's Domaine de Lalisse.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.940
One of the brands
we market at Agence Grateau.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.651
I've seen the social for Champère.
Very clever.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.321
But I haven't seen Mindy. Is she here yet?

10:13.404 --> 10:14.989
Oh, I'm sure she's on her way.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.743
But by the way, congratulations
on acquiring Pierre Cadault.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.369
He is such a talent.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.039
Thank you. He's having quite a resurgence.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.416
He is. Which, as you know,

10:25.499 --> 10:27.585
happened when we started
working with him at Savoir.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.588
Yes. He often credits you
for inspiring his latest chapter.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.757
Oh, so then you see our value.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.719
I wish there was a way that we could
work together on Pierre's account.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.262
We could be outside consultants.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.641
Hasn't anyone told you
we don't do business at parties in France?

10:42.266 --> 10:44.852
Well, this apartment
is technically on British soil.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.395
Excuse me, I just saw Mindy.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.403
-Thanks, Emily.
-You're welcome.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.907
You're Emily?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.284
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm Sofia.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.620
I'm Camille's friend.
I'm meeting her here.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.080
Oh, yes, you're the artist.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.998
I've heard wonderful things
about your show.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.834
I can't wait to see it.
How long are you in town for?

11:08.918 --> 11:11.545
Just for another week.
And then back to Greece.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.590
Camille has been my concierge
and tour guide.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.093
She's the only person I know in Paris,
so she has no choice.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.678
Well, now you know me.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.889
Is she here yet?

11:21.972 --> 11:23.724
I don't know, I haven't seen her.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.976
But here…

11:26.060 --> 11:28.187
<i>saucisson en croûte.</i>

11:28.688 --> 11:29.689
Fancy.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.024
Just pigs in a blanket,
but don't tell anyone.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.484
Bye.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.904
I thought you were gonna be
a professional polo player.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.323
No, come on, you were so good in school.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.367
You know we used to call you Nacho?

11:41.450 --> 11:42.576
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.246
I don't think
my father would've liked that.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.873
He expects his children
to work at the company.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.750
-Mmm.
-Does have its perks.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.253
Two weeks ago
I was on a company retreat in Fiji.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.131
How nice. Two weeks ago,
I was busking in the metro.

11:56.006 --> 11:59.135
But I did get a gig at a jazz club,
so yeah, now I'm legit.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.303
I'm not sure you'll ever be legit.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.514
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

12:03.597 --> 12:05.599
-Even in school, you were a rebel.
-[laughs]

12:05.683 --> 12:08.477
Yeah, well, the one downside
to being a rebel

12:08.561 --> 12:10.688
is your parents shut you out. So…

12:12.398 --> 12:13.566
Wow.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.485
We're getting deep
before I finished my first glass.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.403
That's okay.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.865
It's nice to talk to someone
you don't have to explain yourself to.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.575
Yeah, it is.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.162
Come here.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.788
I'm glad I bumped into you.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.915
Yeah, me too.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.542
-There you are.
-Hi.

12:32.376 --> 12:35.129
Oh. Well, Nicolas,
this is my boyfriend, Benoît.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.090
-Nice to meet you, Benoît.
-Nice to meet you, too.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.175
We perform together,

12:39.258 --> 12:42.678
and actually,
he's going to be joining me on stage

12:42.762 --> 12:44.388
at La Trompette Bleue this week.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.599
Really? Since when?

12:46.682 --> 12:48.434
Since I insisted and they said yes.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.604
This is Nicolas.
A friend from boarding school.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.147
Boarding school?

12:53.230 --> 12:54.774
Le Rosey. In Switzerland.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.401
Well, where else?
Were you in the same class?

12:57.485 --> 12:59.111
No, Nacho was a few years ahead.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.615
I thought you said his name was Nicolas?

13:02.698 --> 13:05.868
I meant Nicolas.
But no, he barely knew I existed.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.995
No, I knew she existed,

13:08.078 --> 13:10.956
but when you're that age,
three years is a giant gulf.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.834
I was about to turn 18
and she was just a kid.

13:13.918 --> 13:14.835
Ew.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.797
But at this age,
three years is nothing, right?

13:18.589 --> 13:19.507
So true.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.970
If you'll excuse me, I need to get going.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.848
-It was lovely seeing you again.
-You too.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.099
-Nice meeting you.
-Yep.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.729
La Trompette Bleue.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.857
You two seemed very cozy.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.651
No, we're just old friends.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.906
Thank you for a lovely evening.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.282
Oh! Um…

13:45.366 --> 13:46.992
Yeah, no, thank you for coming.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.036
Tomorrow, JVMA is sponsoring an event

13:49.119 --> 13:51.497
to launch a new sunblock at Hôtel Molitor.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.374
I'll arrange for VIP lounge chairs.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.291
And bring Mindy.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.796
Oh, well, if there will be VIP
lounge chairs, we will definitely be in.

13:59.004 --> 13:59.964
See you soon.

14:02.424 --> 14:07.638
I'm not much of a city person,
but Paris really is magical.

14:07.721 --> 14:08.931
[Camille] Mmm-hmm.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.726
I live here
and I never get over how beautiful it is.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.353
The people are beautiful too.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.814
Not as beautiful
as the visitors from Greece.

14:16.897 --> 14:17.982
[both chuckle]

14:18.983 --> 14:21.902
You know, this show has been
so much more than I expected.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.488
I know, the response has been incredible.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.365
I was talking about you.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.495
It has been such a special experience.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.789
Working with you and getting to know you.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.626
I don't want it to end.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.047
Do you?

14:43.215 --> 14:44.049
I don't.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.265
[jazz music playing]

15:05.487 --> 15:06.322
Ah.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.323
Hey.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.657
Mmm, looks good.

15:12.703 --> 15:16.415
It's getting a little stuffy in here.
You want to show me that roof?

15:21.879 --> 15:22.713
Absolutely.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.133
[jazz music playing]

15:37.353 --> 15:40.105
You know what,
it's kind of windy out there. And cold.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.858
It's beautiful, but we can
go back another day. Okay?

15:44.234 --> 15:45.069
All right.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.535
[dance music playing]

16:00.459 --> 16:02.086

16:04.880 --> 16:06.006
Mindy, over here!

16:07.341 --> 16:08.592
[Mindy] Wow.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.386
Nicolas really hooked us up.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.304
Plus he sent over some champagne.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.807
Finally, someone who understands my needs.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.100
Have you seen him yet?

16:16.183 --> 16:17.810
Not yet, but he'll find us.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.355
So, I saw something at Alfie's party

16:21.438 --> 16:23.857
that I wish I hadn't,
but I don't want to gossip.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.777
Ooh! You know I love when
a story starts like that.

16:26.860 --> 16:30.864
Okay, I was up on the roof
and I saw Camille and Sofia making out.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.826
Sexy. Why am I never around
when anything good happens?

16:33.909 --> 16:35.786
It's not good, okay? It's terrible.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.205
She's having an affair
and Gabriel has no idea.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.165
-What am I supposed to do?
-An affair?

16:40.249 --> 16:43.002
You saw two girls kissing at a party.
You need to get out more.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.795
Okay, well, it was quite the kiss.

16:45.295 --> 16:49.049
Okay, Emily Jane Cooper,
<i>occupe-toi de tes oignons.</i>

16:49.800 --> 16:51.093
Occupy your onions?

16:51.176 --> 16:53.637
Watch your onions.
It means stay out of it.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.682
You're responsible
for breaking up Camille and Gabriel once.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.351
Why couldn't they've been
making out on someone else's roof?

16:59.435 --> 17:01.103

17:01.186 --> 17:02.104
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
-Hi.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.691
[in French] Would you like to try
our new mineral sunblock, Soleil De Paris?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.152
It rubs in clear, is non-greasy,

17:08.235 --> 17:09.945
and has a subtle scent of citrus.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.113
<i>Merci.</i>

17:12.406 --> 17:14.700
[in English] Well, I'll just be
taking one. Thank you.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.455
Just because I was raised rich
doesn't mean I don't love a free sample.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.998
Soleil De Paris.

17:21.623 --> 17:25.085
[gasps] You know what song would be
perfect for their commercials?

17:25.169 --> 17:28.172
Dear Lord, please, give it a rest
for, like, two minutes, Em.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.466
"Mon Soleil,"
the song Benoît wrote for you.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.010
We should pitch it to Nicolas
to use in their ads.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.221
Do you think he'd be interested?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.806
Why not? The song is so good.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.809
I mean, Benoît could
really use that money.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.189
Plus, I feel like
his self-esteem kind of took a hit

17:45.272 --> 17:47.483
when I got the job
at La Trompette Bleue without him.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.402
Maybe selling his song
will be just the boost he needs.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.071

Oh, you can relax.

I'm not going to make any more
outrageous proposals… for myself.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.675
We've a friend who wrote a song

18:13.759 --> 18:16.470
that could be perfect
for a Soleil De Paris commercial.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.930
It's called "Mon Soleil."

18:18.013 --> 18:19.973
Benoît wrote it. Remember, you met him.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.600
-The boyfriend? Right.
-Yes.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.353

Mindy sings on it and she's amazing.

Well, no. Shh!

Well, if Mindy's singing,
then I'd love to hear it.

Play him the remix version.

What am I gonna do?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.072
Hold my phone to his ear
for three minutes?

18:35.739 --> 18:37.616
-I should send it to you.
-Give me your phone.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.076
-Give it.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.536

-No.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.741
but it turns out Benoît isn't interested
in selling the song.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.993
Hey, you tried.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.287
Artists are strange creatures.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.998
I'm going to give you a shot
on the Soleil De Paris account.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.000
-Really?
<i>-Yes.</i>

21:33.083 --> 21:35.127
It's not because you made La Liste today.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.586
<i>But congrats on that.</i>

21:37.337 --> 21:40.215
<i>You think outside the box.</i>
<i>It makes me think I should too.</i>

21:42.050 --> 21:44.011
Wait, what? I made La Liste?

21:48.765 --> 21:50.517
I'm sorry, I have to call you back.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.769
I'm thrilled
to be working with you, though.

21:52.853 --> 21:53.770
Okay, bye.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.897
Um…

21:59.443 --> 22:00.736
Oh, my God.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.657
Oh, wow. Gabriel?

22:05.741 --> 22:06.992
Um…

22:07.534 --> 22:10.787
Where is Sylvie? This is a disaster.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.708
Um… Just one second.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.625
Hello?

22:15.709 --> 22:16.710
Did you see?

22:16.793 --> 22:18.086
Yes, just now.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.464
The voice mail is full
with people asking for tables.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.716
If this keeps up,
we'll be booked for two months out.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.843
I'm so happy for you, Gabriel,

22:24.926 --> 22:28.388
but Sylvie didn't make the list,
and I don't know what she's gonna do.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.099
[suspenseful music playing]

22:34.186 --> 22:35.729
So, what number am I?

22:38.273 --> 22:39.107
What?

22:40.609 --> 22:41.610
I didn't make it.

22:46.073 --> 22:46.907
Emily.

[exhales]

22:51.495 --> 22:54.081
So I'm not
one of the faces changing Paris.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.085
Fuck La Liste.
Who reads print anymore, anyway?

23:00.379 --> 23:01.838
Anyone who matters in Paris.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.269
How is she?

23:16.353 --> 23:17.229
How do you think?

23:17.312 --> 23:20.148
You are on La Liste and she's not.
How did that happen?

23:20.232 --> 23:21.108
I don't know.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.067
[Luc] Emily.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.903
Sylvie wants to see you
in her office right away.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.405
Is she really mad?

23:31.952 --> 23:33.370
I wish you well.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.709
[shudders]

23:45.549 --> 23:47.551
Sylvie, I had no idea.

23:47.634 --> 23:51.596
You were supposed to promote this company,
not yourself and your chef.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.850
Do you understand
the sort of pressure I'm under

23:54.933 --> 23:57.185
to let people know
Agence Grateau even exists?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.813
To convince people I'm up to the job.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.107
All I did was talk
about how amazing you are.

24:02.190 --> 24:05.277
Yeah, well, you're American,
she's Australian, you colluded.

24:05.360 --> 24:09.531
Okay, I can understand
why you might feel that way,

24:09.614 --> 24:12.742
but believe me,
it's the last thing I would have wanted.

24:12.826 --> 24:17.164
And when you hear my good news,
maybe we can get past this.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.915
Now what?

24:19.916 --> 24:23.712
I got us a new client and it's a big one.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.715
JVMA.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.842
No, that's impossible.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.428
Okay, well, maybe not all of JVMA,

24:31.511 --> 24:34.973
but a brand that they work with,
and that's a foot in the door. Right?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.393
Agence Grateau is
now repping Soleil De Paris.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.189
Okay, that is good news.

24:44.316 --> 24:49.237
And I guess this story will save me
from the torture of filling out your visa.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.532
I understand why
people don't trust the press.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.412
About JVMA…

24:58.914 --> 24:59.748
Good work.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.299
[Gabriel] Tonight was amazing.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.593
We never had
so many sittings in one evening.

Here's to number 8.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.179
Thank you, thank you,

25:14.262 --> 25:17.682
but I wouldn't be where I am today
if it wasn't for number 1.

-To number 1.
-To number 1.

-Hey!

25:22.562 --> 25:23.980
-Who's my number 8?
-Hey.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.318
You must be Gabriel. I'm Sofia.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.028
Sofia, nice to finally meet you.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.446
I forgot you haven't met.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.449
Thank you for loaning me your girlfriend.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.785
[Gabriel chuckles] My pleasure.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.245
What are you guys drinking?

25:38.328 --> 25:40.455
-[Camille] Gin, tonic?
-[Sofia] Gin, tonic.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.378
It's gonna be after my second number

25:46.461 --> 25:47.879
and you'll come on with the guitar

25:47.963 --> 25:51.299
and I'll be at the piano,
and it'll be super simple and elegant.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.927
And if they like us both,
maybe this can be a regular thing.

25:54.010 --> 25:54.844
[Mindy] I hope so.

It's from him, isn't it?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.738
They're just flowers, Benoît.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.491
It's not just that. Okay?

26:17.659 --> 26:20.161
I saw the way
you were talking to him at the party.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.955
I told you, we're old friends.

26:22.038 --> 26:24.332
Yeah, from a fancy boarding school

26:24.416 --> 26:26.876
in a life that I'll never be a part of
or understand.

That again?

Are you serious? I…

26:30.755 --> 26:33.383
I am so tired of apologizing for who I am.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.177
I can't change my past.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.431
If you'll always resent me for it,
maybe we don't have a future.
