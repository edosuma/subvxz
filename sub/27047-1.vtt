12:21.436 --> 12:24.613
would've made it seem
almost, uh, surreal.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.093
And...

12:27.921 --> 12:30.837
it's normal to romanticize
about how good things were.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.839
[Chuckling]

12:32.882 --> 12:34.362
- Wow!

12:34.405 --> 12:36.930
You've really
haven't experienced

12:36.973 --> 12:39.193
what Tyler and I had, have you?

12:39.236 --> 12:41.717
'Cause, trust me,
it was very real.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.982
[Crickets chirping]

13:12.922 --> 13:16.273
- Hey, Frank, you want me to
lock the door on my way out?

13:16.317 --> 13:18.188
- No, I'll get it
in a few. Cheers!

13:32.376 --> 13:34.726
- Sorry, but we're closed.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.946
- I know!

13:36.990 --> 13:40.689
I just thought this might
be a good time to talk...

13:40.732 --> 13:42.691
about a job.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.388
If you're hiring,
that is.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.741
[Chuckling]

14:13.591 --> 14:17.900
[Breathing heavily]

14:17.944 --> 14:19.162
[Gasping]

14:21.425 --> 14:23.253
[Breathing heavily]

14:32.262 --> 14:34.221
[Sighing]

14:49.236 --> 14:50.802
[Clearing throat]

14:50.846 --> 14:55.111
- Welcome, and thank you
all for being here today.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.897
I'd like to start off
today's sermon

14:57.940 --> 15:01.030
with, uh, with something
from Psalm 139.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.078
- Kara! Surprised
you're here.

15:05.121 --> 15:08.951
Tyler and I always spent
Sunday mornings in bed.

15:08.995 --> 15:09.952
[Chuckling]

15:09.996 --> 15:11.475
- So you've said!

15:11.519 --> 15:12.955
What about you?

15:12.999 --> 15:16.089
I didn't think you were
interested in attending.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.308
- I'm here for
the same reason I see you,

15:18.352 --> 15:21.007
to assure my doting dad
I'm redeeming my sinful soul.

15:21.050 --> 15:24.314
I gotta go. Make sure
you thank Tyler for me.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.577
- Thank him?

15:26.621 --> 15:28.101
- For the job!

15:28.144 --> 15:30.146
Turns out he was short-staffed.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.713
- Isabelle.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.021
As your counsellor,

15:35.064 --> 15:36.979
I have to tell you
it's not a good idea

15:37.023 --> 15:38.850
for you to be
working with Tyler.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.244
And I'm sure that
your father would agree.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.813
- Are you really telling me that
as my counsellor or his fiancée?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.336
- It's Recovery 101.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.860
Anyone you associate from
your past with drug use

15:48.904 --> 15:50.645
should be cut out
of your life.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.604
- I'm sure you'll
figure this out, Kara,

15:53.648 --> 15:56.346
but I don't always
do what I'm told.

15:56.390 --> 16:00.698
And as I said to you before, I
like the friends I had, a lot.

16:22.633 --> 16:23.765
[Sighing]

16:23.808 --> 16:26.507
- She went straight
to Frank, hon.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.076
- And you think
that's it?

16:30.119 --> 16:31.816
She got the job
just like that,

16:31.860 --> 16:33.818
even though we weren't
short-staffed.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.169
- I like to think Frank's
a better man than that.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.300
- What about her?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.041
- Look, I'm sorry,
Kara. I tried.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.348
I even spoke to Frank
about the situation,

16:41.391 --> 16:44.177
but he already put her
on the schedule for tonight.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.352
[Sighing]

16:47.919 --> 16:49.704
- Well, she's clearly
playing games...

16:51.445 --> 16:53.534
and I can't be
her counsellor anymore

16:53.577 --> 16:55.188
if that's what she's doing.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.277
- OK, and I'll make sure
I juggle your shifts

16:57.320 --> 16:59.061
so you're not working
the same ones.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.324
- I don't care about having
to work with her, Tyler!

17:01.368 --> 17:02.325
I care about you!

17:02.369 --> 17:03.674
[Scoffing]

17:03.718 --> 17:05.849
The history that
you guys have together,

17:05.894 --> 17:07.242
the drugs,
the alcohol.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.637
I mean, she clearly
has no boundaries.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.944
- Hey, look, you have nothing
to worry about, all right?

17:12.988 --> 17:14.816
I'm a different man now.

17:14.858 --> 17:17.297
And we're getting
married, remember?

17:17.339 --> 17:18.472
- When?

17:18.515 --> 17:20.430
I know we talked
about the spring,

17:20.473 --> 17:22.084
but we haven't
set a date.

17:22.127 --> 17:26.435
- Then pick one, and I'll be
there till death do us part.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.176
- Sounds kind
of morbid.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.832
- Well, then, we'll
write our own vows.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.055
- I just don't want you
to get sucked back in again.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.231
- Trust me,
that'll never happen.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.106
[Sighing]

18:00.905 --> 18:02.081
[Chuckling]

18:16.704 --> 18:17.661
[Cell ringing]

18:21.839 --> 18:23.276
- Hey, babe! What's up?

18:23.319 --> 18:26.844
- How does May 6 sound?

18:26.888 --> 18:30.370
- Are there any other dates?

18:30.413 --> 18:34.504
- Not in May, and I thought we
wanted to have a spring wedding.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.463
- Yeah, no, no.
I do, I do.

18:36.506 --> 18:39.074
It's just, uh,
May 6 is Elle's birthday

18:39.118 --> 18:42.991
and I don't our wedding to
have anything to do with her.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.340
[Sniffing]

18:44.384 --> 18:47.169
- Fine! Um, I'll just pick
another date!

18:47.213 --> 18:50.477
How are things going with her?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.479
- No problems.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.307
- Good.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.091
Then...

18:58.224 --> 19:02.489
how does June 17 sound?

19:02.532 --> 19:05.056
- OK, book it.
Look, I gotta go.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.711
I'll see you when
I get home, OK?

19:11.889 --> 19:14.370
- Thanks, Brie.
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.893
- Bye!

19:22.248 --> 19:24.075
- Why don't you go?
I can do that.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.642
- Are you kidding me?

19:25.686 --> 19:28.732
I gotta show my new boss
I can finish the job.

19:28.776 --> 19:29.733
[Chuckling]

19:34.608 --> 19:38.351
Hey, remember that time we went
to that bar in the east end?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.048
I got there
ahead of you,

19:40.091 --> 19:42.572
and we pretended we
didn't know each other.

19:42.616 --> 19:43.704
[Chuckling]

19:43.747 --> 19:44.966
I was sitting
at the bar,

19:45.009 --> 19:46.750
and all those boys
were hitting on me.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.404
And then you walked in.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.974
You watched me
for a while,

19:53.017 --> 19:55.629
then introduced
yourself to me.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.805
And within minutes,

19:57.848 --> 20:01.548
I let you slide your
hand under my skirt.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.245
[Chuckling]

20:03.289 --> 20:06.553
Oh, I thought those boys were
gonna fall off their stools

20:06.596 --> 20:07.815
when they saw that.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.340
- That was a long time ago.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.298
- Yeah!

20:13.908 --> 20:15.126
[Sighing]

20:15.170 --> 20:17.477
I wish I hadn't
been gone so long.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.958
- It was a
good thing.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.917
It helped you kick
your bad habits.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.136
- Not all of them.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.247
What, you don't
drink anymore?

20:49.639 --> 20:51.075
- Not for 6 months.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.296
- Wow! Is that
the Kara effect?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.037
- Kara's a good person.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.736
She works hard, and she knows
how to take care of people.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.477
- So she's a good girl.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.829
Not like I was.

21:05.873 --> 21:06.917
[Sighing]

21:06.961 --> 21:08.789
You know,

21:08.832 --> 21:12.140
I don't mind giving up
the pills and the alcohol.

21:12.183 --> 21:15.186
There's one thing
I do not wanna give up.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.321
Do you know
what that is?

21:22.237 --> 21:23.369
[Clicks tongue]

21:23.412 --> 21:25.066
Come on, Tyler!

21:25.109 --> 21:29.244
You can't tell me you don't
remember how good it was.

21:29.288 --> 21:33.161
We couldn't go anywhere
without getting into it.

21:36.164 --> 21:40.516
Hmm! The laundry mat,
the elevator...

21:42.953 --> 21:46.566
top of the bar,
just like this.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.878
- I'm gonna finish closing up.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.880
I'll lock the door
after you leave.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.757
[Chuckling]

22:03.800 --> 22:05.019
- Hmm!

22:09.110 --> 22:11.155
[Sighing]

22:13.288 --> 22:14.855
[Cell phone chiming]

22:23.603 --> 22:24.691
[Cell phone chiming]

22:42.143 --> 22:43.797
- I'm off to play squash
with Dave.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.233
- Stop! Turn around!
- What?

22:45.276 --> 22:46.626
- Don't look!
- What is it?

22:46.669 --> 22:48.367
- It's my mother's
wedding dress.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.151
It's bad luck
if you see it!

22:50.194 --> 22:53.937
- Kara, I've already seen photos
of your parents' wedding day.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.897
- That is not the same
thing, and you know it.

22:56.940 --> 23:00.422
Now, close your eyes and do
not open them until I'm gone.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.163
- Where you going?

23:02.206 --> 23:05.079
- I'm going to the tailor, and
then I'm going to the church.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.080
I'll see you later.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.168
[Groaning]

23:07.211 --> 23:08.474
Keep 'em closed!
- Mm-hmm!

23:17.700 --> 23:18.919
- Father?

23:18.962 --> 23:23.271
- Kara! Something
I can help you with?

23:23.314 --> 23:25.447
- Um, yeah.
Sorry to interrupt.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.231
I just wanted to let you know

23:27.275 --> 23:30.278
that we decided on a date
for the wedding: June 17.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.932
- Wonderful!

23:31.975 --> 23:33.455
[Giggling]

23:33.499 --> 23:35.544
Afternoon or evening?

23:35.588 --> 23:38.460
- We think an afternoon
wedding would be nice.

23:38.504 --> 23:41.115
- Ah, great! I--I'll
put it in the calendar.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.725
- Great!

23:42.769 --> 23:44.684
Oh, and I was wondering

23:44.727 --> 23:47.295
if you could possibly
find another counsellor

23:47.338 --> 23:49.428
for one of my clients,
Isabelle Lloyd.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.429
- Of course!

23:50.472 --> 23:51.517
But before I do,

23:51.560 --> 23:53.867
is there a problem
I should know about?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.390
- No! Of course not!

23:55.434 --> 23:57.871
You know, sometimes
you just realize

23:57.914 --> 24:00.569
it's not a great fit
for either of you.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.442
- Fair enough!
- Great, thanks!

24:12.059 --> 24:13.669
- He always looked after us.

24:13.713 --> 24:16.193
I mean, whenever
I even mentioned getting a job,

24:16.237 --> 24:17.281
he'd get upset.

24:19.501 --> 24:23.026
- That's because he wanted
to isolate you, Laura.

24:23.070 --> 24:26.203
He wanted you to
feel dependant on him.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.032
[Sniffling]

24:29.076 --> 24:32.514
- I know! But now I don't know
how to get away from him.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.602
[Sighing]

24:33.646 --> 24:36.518
- You are skilled IT.

24:36.562 --> 24:39.434
You can make a life for you
and your daughter.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.915
- And what if he finds us?

24:41.958 --> 24:44.047
- We will find a way
that he doesn't.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.529
[Sniffling, whimpering]

24:47.573 --> 24:51.011
- No one's ever wanted
to help me like you.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.014
Why do you care so much?

24:55.450 --> 24:57.147
[Sighing]

24:57.191 --> 25:01.151
- 'Cause nobody should have
to live the way that you do.

25:01.195 --> 25:04.285
It's my job to help you
get through this.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.461
OK?

25:10.857 --> 25:13.207
- I know exactly
the kind of day you've had,

25:13.250 --> 25:15.862
so I'll make sure they
throw in an extra splash.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.341
[Giggling]

25:17.385 --> 25:19.692
- Just make sure there's
no carbs on my plate.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.563
- I'm sorry.
What--what was that?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.173
- Just salad
on the side.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.740
- Right, no carbs. I got it.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.655
Um, I'll be back
with your drinks.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.352
- Excuse me!

25:28.396 --> 25:31.268
But we've been waiting
30 minutes for our meal.

25:31.312 --> 25:34.663
- Oh! I'm sorry. I'll go
check with the kitchen.

25:34.707 --> 25:35.751
[Scoffing]

25:35.795 --> 25:37.405
Can I get a house red?
- Yeah.

25:37.448 --> 25:39.059
- Do you have
the inventory list?

25:39.102 --> 25:40.016
- Sure.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.589
- Tyler, I'm sorry, I don't
know what happened,

25:47.633 --> 25:50.244
but somehow the kitchen
didn't get Table 7's order,

25:50.287 --> 25:52.638
and they've already been
waiting for 30 minutes.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.944
- All right,
don't worry.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.816
I'll just comp them their meals.
- OK.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.034
- You OK?

25:58.078 --> 26:00.384
- Yeah, I'm fine!

26:00.428 --> 26:03.083
- I need a bottle of
vodka on ice, please.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.911
- Can I get
that house red?

26:04.954 --> 26:07.000
- Hey, tone it down.
This isn't the bar.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.392
- You're
the boss!

26:09.698 --> 26:11.047
[Sighing]

26:11.091 --> 26:13.397
- I'm sorry you had
to work with her, Kara,

26:13.441 --> 26:15.443
but I had no choice
when Brie called in.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.619
- It's OK.
- Not really.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.794
[Laughing]

26:18.838 --> 26:20.535
Come on!

26:20.579 --> 26:23.973
- Stop it! Stop, stop!
Wow, you are handsy!

26:24.017 --> 26:25.192
[Laughing]

26:25.235 --> 26:26.236
No!

26:26.280 --> 26:27.542
- Excuse me, guys.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.675
I don't mind if you
guys have a good time,

26:29.718 --> 26:31.328
but hands off my
staff, all right?

26:33.809 --> 26:35.028
- That's my hero.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.034
[Sighing]

26:54.569 --> 26:56.963
I'm glad to know
Tyler still has my back.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.837
Although he didn't always mind
me flirting with other men.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.449
- He was doing
his job, Elle.

27:05.493 --> 27:06.450
[Chuckling]

27:06.494 --> 27:08.365
- Maybe.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.280
But when someone
trusts you enough

27:10.324 --> 27:12.674
to let them act out
their wildest fantasies,

27:12.718 --> 27:14.633
you know they'll
always have your back.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.996
- Is she gone?
- Yeah.

27:30.039 --> 27:33.521
- Good. I'll have to have a talk
with her about tonight.

27:33.564 --> 27:36.655
Working the tables like that
was fine in the bar,

27:36.698 --> 27:38.221
but not here.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.399
- When you two
were together...

27:44.140 --> 27:46.882
did you like it when she
flirted with other guys?

27:48.492 --> 27:49.929
- What?

27:49.972 --> 27:51.931
[Sighing]

27:51.974 --> 27:53.628
- Did it turn you on?

27:56.762 --> 27:59.939
- Why are we talking about this?
Did she say something to you?

28:01.897 --> 28:05.074
- Maybe I just wanna
know what turns you on.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.859
[Sighing]

28:06.902 --> 28:08.730
- You do.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.559
And when we get home, I'm gonna
show you exactly how much.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.433
- Come here.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.175
- What are
you doing?

28:21.787 --> 28:23.527
- I'm not waiting
until we get home.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.459
[Cell phone chiming]

28:44.287 --> 28:47.508
[Sighing, grunting]

28:51.991 --> 28:53.470
[Cell phone chiming]

28:55.342 --> 28:57.039
What is it?

28:57.083 --> 28:59.433
- It's Elle.
She's freaking out.

28:59.476 --> 29:00.913
- Why?

29:00.956 --> 29:04.307
- Her dad's working.
She's taken a bunch of oxy.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.570
- Tell her to
call her sponsor.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.921
- She did.
She hasn't responded.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.966
She wants me
to come help.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.664
- Tyler, it's not your
job to save her anymore.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.971
- What am I supposed
to do, Kara, ignore it?

29:16.015 --> 29:17.930
'Cause I've seen
her OD before.

29:17.973 --> 29:18.974
[Ringing]

29:23.544 --> 29:24.850
- Isabelle?

29:24.893 --> 29:26.547
[Elle on phone, indistinct]

29:26.590 --> 29:29.332
No, I'm not putting
him on the phone.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.594
Calm down.

29:30.638 --> 29:31.987
[Elle sobbing]

29:32.031 --> 29:34.120
What about your dad?
- Yeah, right!

29:34.163 --> 29:35.948
- I'm sure if you
called your dad,

29:35.991 --> 29:37.645
he would be willing
to help you.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.908
- Nah, you don't get it.

29:39.952 --> 29:43.303
- Isabelle? Isabelle!

29:44.391 --> 29:45.827
[Sighing]

29:48.699 --> 29:49.831
- What are you doing?

29:49.875 --> 29:51.485
- What I was
trained to do.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.487
- I'll come with you.
- No, Tyler.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.141
It's exactly what she wants.

29:55.184 --> 29:58.187
And when an addict gets
what they want, they never stop.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.584
[Sighing]

30:19.905 --> 30:21.602
- What the hell are
you doing here?

30:21.645 --> 30:23.734
- I came to see
if you're OK.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.954
- And why do you care?

30:25.998 --> 30:28.174
- Until Father Macey finds
you another counsellor,

30:28.217 --> 30:29.349
you're still my client.

30:29.392 --> 30:30.829
How many pills
did you take?

30:30.872 --> 30:32.874
- And why would I need
a new counsellor?

30:32.918 --> 30:34.833
- Because this
isn't working.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.270
- Because you're
starting to crack?

30:37.313 --> 30:39.968
- I need to know if
I should call 911.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.536
And if I do, I'm gonna have
to call your father as well.

30:42.579 --> 30:44.886
- I'm fine.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.714
- That's what
I thought.

30:46.757 --> 30:50.370
- You know, it's sad how
painfully insecure you are.

30:50.413 --> 30:54.200
But I guess you can't be
faulted, after being orphaned.

30:54.243 --> 30:57.551
I'm just surprised Tyler's
with someone like you.

30:57.594 --> 30:59.858
- I'm not the one who
called my ex-boyfriend

30:59.901 --> 31:01.772
in the middle of
the night, Isabelle.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.296
You might wanna
reflect on that.

31:03.339 --> 31:05.037
- Wow!

31:05.080 --> 31:07.909
Underneath this whole Mother
Teresa thing you got going,

31:07.953 --> 31:08.997
you're a real bitch!

31:15.134 --> 31:16.787

- Hey, Kara.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.137
- Is everything OK?

32:02.181 --> 32:05.532
- He, um, came home
from work, so I can't.

32:05.575 --> 32:06.881
[Sighing]

32:06.925 --> 32:08.361
- I understand.

32:08.404 --> 32:11.016
- I hate this place.
I need to talk to you.

32:11.059 --> 32:13.366
- Just call me
when you can get away,

32:13.409 --> 32:16.021
and we'll make
another appointment, OK?

32:16.064 --> 32:18.066
- OK.

32:18.110 --> 32:19.720
- It'll be OK.

32:19.763 --> 32:22.592

He's calling me.

32:22.636 --> 32:24.029
I'll see you when I can.

[Cat meowing, bell tinkling]

33:03.285 --> 33:05.157
- Kara! I have
some good news.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.203
One of our other counsellors
is more than happy

33:08.247 --> 33:09.813
to take on
your client.

33:09.857 --> 33:12.251
- That's great!
Thank you!

33:12.294 --> 33:13.817
- You're welcome!

33:42.107 --> 33:45.588
[Breathing unevenly]

33:52.378 --> 33:55.076
- You normally leave
your office unlocked?

33:55.120 --> 33:57.905
- This is a church. We don't
usually lock the doors.

33:57.948 --> 34:00.473
- No. I--I didn't
lock my office.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.258
- You didn't see
anybody coming or going?

34:03.302 --> 34:05.434
- Just Father Macey.

34:05.478 --> 34:08.045
- And I was in my office
for most of the morning,

34:08.089 --> 34:09.525
so Kara's the
only one I saw

34:09.569 --> 34:11.310
other than my
assistant, Mrs. Walsh.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.746
- Kara? You OK?

34:13.790 --> 34:16.228
- Yeah.

34:16.271 --> 34:17.967
- This is?

34:18.012 --> 34:20.754
- My fiancé, Tyler.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.625
- Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

34:22.668 --> 34:25.150
- Yeah, sure. Sure. How about
we take it outside, though?

34:25.193 --> 34:26.107
- Yeah.

34:34.594 --> 34:38.424
You know the last session
I had with Isabelle,

34:38.467 --> 34:42.036
she kept asking me questions
about my parents.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.213
And then when I went to her
house the other night,

34:45.257 --> 34:46.649
she called
me an orphan.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.654
- Why didn't you
tell me all this?

34:51.697 --> 34:53.873
- I didn't wanna
make her a problem.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.356
- Why do you think
she did this?

34:59.706 --> 35:01.838
- I think she's
being forced

35:01.882 --> 35:05.146
to give up something
she doesn't want to: you.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.974
And I think
she's fighting it.

35:07.017 --> 35:10.369
Part of me wants to keep
treating her so I can help her,

35:10.412 --> 35:13.676
and the other part just wants
her the hell out of our lives.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.766
[Sighing]

35:16.810 --> 35:19.291
- I'll talk to Frank again
tomorrow when she's not in.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.684
I'll say whatever I have
to so he lets her go.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.295
And then we can
be done with her.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.168
But just in case
it wasn't her...

35:28.474 --> 35:30.780
I want you to keep
this in your office.

35:30.824 --> 35:31.738
To load a round...

35:33.566 --> 35:35.437
you pull the slide.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.743
Now it's ready.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.704
- I can't bring this
into the church.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.706
- I don't care if
it's the Taj Mahal.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.013
You deal with people
with serious problems.

35:46.056 --> 35:48.624

clients finds it and uses it?

35:48.668 --> 35:49.495

want it in the house.

door even when I'm there.

about Elle Lloyd.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.059
- Why? Is there a problem?

36:32.102 --> 36:34.540
- No, I just don't think
she's a good fit

36:34.583 --> 36:35.889
for the restaurant.

36:35.932 --> 36:38.326
I mean, she was great
working at the bar,

36:38.370 --> 36:40.546
but I think you run
a classier place,

36:40.589 --> 36:42.635
and she can be
a bit too hands on.

36:42.678 --> 36:46.029
- As far as I can see,
she's good for business.

36:46.073 --> 36:49.250
- She's a troublemaker, Frank.
- For who? You?

36:49.294 --> 36:52.035
- I told you the situation.

36:52.079 --> 36:55.822
- And I'm telling you she's good
for business, so figure it out.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.954
If you can't handle your women,

36:57.998 --> 37:00.479
then maybe this isn't
a good fit for you.

- Sorry. Didn't mean
to almost hit you.

37:54.141 --> 37:55.708
- What are you doing here?

37:55.751 --> 37:57.013
- I had a craving.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.624
- For what?

37:58.667 --> 38:01.322
- Something
hot and sticky.

38:01.366 --> 38:04.456
You know, Mike's Donuts
around the corner.

38:04.499 --> 38:07.676
I couldn't wait,
so I pulled over.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.809
- Is that really
the reason you're here.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.202
- Is there another?
- I don't know.

38:12.246 --> 38:15.815
Maybe the same reason you took
a job at the restaurant.

38:15.858 --> 38:20.602
- I lived here, Kara, slept in
his bed, ate in his kitchen.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.604
Sometimes I miss it.

38:22.648 --> 38:25.303
The donuts, that is.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.049
Have a good night.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.418

cleaning? It's 1:00 a.m.

38:56.682 --> 38:57.770
[Sighing]

38:57.813 --> 39:00.207
- Did you talk to Frank?

39:00.250 --> 39:04.559
- He said Elle was
too good for business.

39:04.603 --> 39:05.952
- Course she is.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.652
Did you know
she was here?

39:10.696 --> 39:13.873
She said she had
a craving for donuts.

39:13.916 --> 39:17.398
But I know she was just
watching us, or me at least.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.747
- Like a stalker?

39:18.791 --> 39:21.010
- She took a job
at our place.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.883
She calls in the
middle of the night.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.667
Yeah, like a stalker.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.365
[Sighing]

39:27.408 --> 39:30.106
- Look, I'll, uh, I'll talk
to her myself, all right?

39:30.150 --> 39:32.935
I'll, uh, I'll make sure
she leaves us alone.

39:41.683 --> 39:43.555
[Sighing]

39:50.649 --> 39:52.651
How were
your donuts?

39:52.694 --> 39:55.305
- Just like they
always were.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.177
[Chuckling]

39:57.220 --> 40:00.528
Remember you used to bring me
a half-dozen every Saturday

40:00.572 --> 40:01.964
and feed them
to me in bed?

40:03.575 --> 40:05.751
- Did you vandalize
Kara's office?

40:05.794 --> 40:07.666
- What are you
talking about?

40:07.709 --> 40:10.233
- You need to back off, Elle.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.410
- Hey! I am not
her client anymore,

40:12.453 --> 40:16.022
so whatever work issue she has
has nothing to do with me.

40:16.065 --> 40:19.678
- You know, if I had it my way,
you wouldn't be working here.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.637
- I am just trying to get
back on my feet, Tyler.

40:22.681 --> 40:26.162
It's not my problem that
your future wife is so insecure,

40:26.206 --> 40:29.165
which is why I'm sure
you're talking to me right now.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.428
[Chuckling]

40:30.471 --> 40:33.648
- I'm happy, Elle!
All right?

40:33.692 --> 40:37.870
I've--I've moved on,
and so should you.

40:37.913 --> 40:41.482
I mean, look how far
you've come.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.876
- Oh! Are you proud of me?

40:43.919 --> 40:45.443
That's so sweet.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.184
I wish I could say the same,

40:48.228 --> 40:52.101
but to be honest,
you've disappointed me.

40:52.145 --> 40:56.192
From what I recall, you're
not the marrying type.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.499
Variety is the spice
of life, remember?

40:58.543 --> 41:00.893
At least that's
what you told me

41:00.936 --> 41:02.895
when you brought
a third into our bed.

41:02.938 --> 41:03.939
[Chuckling]

41:03.983 --> 41:05.985
- It wasn't real, Elle.

41:06.028 --> 41:10.511
What we had, it was a drug-
and alcohol-infused fantasy.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.557
You understand
that, right?

41:20.521 --> 41:23.611
- Are you getting married
in a church, Tyler?

41:23.655 --> 41:26.832
- What does that have
to do with anything?

41:26.875 --> 41:30.836
- I know you, and you're the
one living in a fantasy now.

41:35.014 --> 41:37.582
- Back off, Elle.
I mean it.

41:37.625 --> 41:40.541
- I'll see you
at my next shift.

41:40.585 --> 41:45.198
[♪ Humming Wedding March♪]

41:45.241 --> 41:46.678
[Sighing]

41:46.721 --> 41:48.288
[Scoffing]

42:00.866 --> 42:03.477
- Have you seen
Gulliver this morning?

42:03.521 --> 42:05.740
He hasn't come in
for breakfast.

42:05.784 --> 42:08.874
- He's probably decapitating
a bird somewhere.

42:08.917 --> 42:12.704
We'll get the cat flap sealed
up before the weather turns.

42:19.014 --> 42:22.017
Do we have to get married
in a church?

42:22.061 --> 42:23.758
[Stammering]

42:23.802 --> 42:28.589
- No, it's what we discussed.
Why, you don't want to anymore?

42:28.633 --> 42:30.591
- No! No, no.
It's just...

42:30.635 --> 42:34.508
I guess I'm just wondering
why it has to be at church.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.032
Why not our backyard
or something?

42:37.076 --> 42:38.904
Aren't the vows the same?

42:38.947 --> 42:40.906
- Yeah! They can be.

42:44.170 --> 42:45.084
Tyler, you...

42:45.127 --> 42:46.607
[Chuckling]

42:46.651 --> 42:49.349
You were the one who insisted
on doing this for me.

42:49.392 --> 42:52.134
But if you've changed your
mind, I totally understand.

42:52.178 --> 42:54.397
- Oh, no, no.
No, you're right.

42:54.441 --> 42:58.750
You're right, I was the one that
pushed the issue, and I'm sorry.

42:58.793 --> 43:01.448
I don't know why
I'm over-thinking this.

43:01.491 --> 43:03.493
We'll still do
it, all right?

43:03.537 --> 43:07.019
Just don't expect me to
get baptized anytime soon.

43:07.062 --> 43:10.675
- I would never force you to do
anything you didn't wanna do.

43:10.718 --> 43:12.067
You know that, right?

43:12.111 --> 43:13.503
- Yeah! Yeah, of course.

Gulliver!

43:47.799 --> 43:50.802
No! Oh my God!

[Sobbing]

43:53.761 --> 43:55.589
Tyler!

43:56.982 --> 43:59.071
Tyler, please come here!

44:00.986 --> 44:02.988
Oh, my baby!

44:03.031 --> 44:06.382
Oh! No, no, no!

[Crying and sniffling]

44:21.876 --> 44:23.530
- Where is he?

44:23.573 --> 44:26.751
- Don't worry.
I took care of him.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.709
[Sighing]

44:28.753 --> 44:30.493
- She did this, Tyler!

44:31.843 --> 44:33.235
I know she did!

44:33.279 --> 44:35.411
- Kara, you don't know that.

44:35.455 --> 44:37.805
Maybe he tried walking
on the cover and got stuck.

44:37.849 --> 44:39.546
He sat by that pond all summer.

44:39.589 --> 44:41.679
- Why are you defending her?
- I'm not!

44:41.722 --> 44:43.898
I just don't think
she's a sociopath.

44:43.942 --> 44:46.205
- And how can you say that?
Are you the therapist?

44:46.248 --> 44:49.121
We have to go to the police.
- With what?

44:49.164 --> 44:52.907
We have no proof she's done any
of this, so it'll just make it

44:52.951 --> 44:55.301
that much easier for her dad
to make it go away.

44:55.344 --> 44:57.607
- I don't know,
but we have to do something.

44:57.651 --> 44:58.739
You can't tell me

44:58.783 --> 45:00.654
that all the bad stuff
that's happened

45:00.698 --> 45:02.221
since she came back into town

45:02.264 --> 45:03.178
is all coincidence!

45:03.222 --> 45:04.397
I don't buy that!

45:06.660 --> 45:08.706
Where are you going?

45:08.749 --> 45:10.708
- I know her, Kara,
like no one else does.

45:10.751 --> 45:12.361
So, when I tell
her what happened,

45:12.405 --> 45:13.493
I'll know if
she did it.

45:13.536 --> 45:15.234
- And if you think
she did it,

45:15.277 --> 45:16.148
then what happens?

45:18.019 --> 45:19.629
- I'll be back
as soon as I can.

45:19.673 --> 45:23.155
[Sniffling, sighing]

45:42.304 --> 45:44.742
[Doorbell ringing]

45:49.659 --> 45:52.793
- Tyler. Something
I can help you with?

45:52.837 --> 45:54.186
- Is Elle home?

45:54.229 --> 45:56.579
- She is. What's
this about?

45:56.623 --> 45:58.059
- I just need
to talk to her.

45:58.103 --> 45:59.104
[Sighing]

45:59.147 --> 46:00.192
- She's good, Tyler.

46:00.235 --> 46:02.020
She's doing much
better on her own.

46:02.063 --> 46:03.021
- And I respect that.

46:04.196 --> 46:05.719
- Tyler!

46:11.856 --> 46:13.683
Did you wanna
come in?

46:13.727 --> 46:16.730
I'll make sure my dad
leaves us alone.

46:16.774 --> 46:20.734
- I'm good. I just wanted
to talk to you about this.

46:20.778 --> 46:23.519
- It's a bit small for me,
don't you think?

46:23.563 --> 46:24.825
[Chuckling]

46:24.869 --> 46:29.003
- It's for a cat,
Kara's, actually.

46:29.047 --> 46:31.832
She found him in
our pond, drowned.

46:31.876 --> 46:35.705
I just wanted to know if
you knew anything about it.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.709
- And how would I?

46:39.753 --> 46:41.755
- It's no secret how
you feel about Kara.

46:41.799 --> 46:44.105
- So, what, you think
I killed her cat?

46:44.149 --> 46:45.541
- Did you?

46:48.501 --> 46:51.286
- You know me, Tyler.
What do you think?

46:51.330 --> 46:52.418
[Sighing]

46:52.461 --> 46:55.377
- I'm hoping it
was an accident.

47:00.078 --> 47:02.645
- I think it's time
for you to leave, son.

47:02.689 --> 47:05.387
- Tell Kara I'm sorry
about her cat.

49:10.991 --> 49:12.514
- Isn't your
shift over?

49:12.558 --> 49:15.778
- I told Frank I could work
a double if he needed me,

49:15.822 --> 49:19.521
and seeing that it's inventory,
looks like you do.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.135
- If you wanna help,
you can count those.

49:36.060 --> 49:40.412
- You believe me, right?
About the cat?

49:43.023 --> 49:46.244
'Cause if you don't,
that's the way to hurt me.

49:46.287 --> 49:48.202
- I wanna believe
you, Elle,

49:48.246 --> 49:50.596
but you've been
doing what you do,

49:50.639 --> 49:53.207
stirring things up,
causing problems,

49:53.251 --> 49:54.904
starting with
this job.

49:54.948 --> 49:57.298
- Fine, I'm busted,
all right?

49:57.342 --> 49:59.518
I got this job to
get close to you.

49:59.561 --> 50:01.302
But that's it!

50:01.346 --> 50:03.696
- So, you haven't been
watching the house,

50:03.739 --> 50:05.393
trying to mess with Kara?

50:05.437 --> 50:07.047
- Tyler, you know me!

50:07.091 --> 50:09.919
Even high, I wouldn't do
the things Kara thinks I did.

50:09.963 --> 50:13.053
And you said it yourself, you
wanna believe me, so just do it.

50:15.403 --> 50:16.883
- Hey, is Tyler here?

50:16.926 --> 50:19.755
- Yeah, downstairs.
You're here to lend a hand?

50:19.799 --> 50:22.454
- Course! Wouldn't leave
you guys high and dry.

50:23.716 --> 50:25.457
- We were messed
up, Tyler,

50:25.500 --> 50:27.459
but it was
never complicated.

50:27.502 --> 50:29.200
Because we
weren't trying

50:29.243 --> 50:32.029
to be something or
someone that we're not.

50:32.072 --> 50:33.465
[Chuckling]

50:33.508 --> 50:36.163
You came in with a squash
racket the other day.

50:36.207 --> 50:37.512
[Chuckling]

50:37.556 --> 50:39.601
What, you're--you're
Mr. Country Club now?

50:41.429 --> 50:42.778
'Cause that
is so not you.

50:44.215 --> 50:47.348
You're the guy who
doesn't care if he shaves,

50:47.392 --> 50:50.134
who flies by the
seat of his pants,

50:50.177 --> 50:52.310
who doesn't
follow the rules.

51:00.405 --> 51:03.016
So, come on, Tyler.

51:03.060 --> 51:06.106
Stop pretending,
and break them.

51:09.501 --> 51:10.676
That's it.

51:11.807 --> 51:13.679
Throw me up
against the wall

51:13.722 --> 51:15.768
and take me like
I don't want it.

51:15.811 --> 51:17.422
'Cause I know
you like that.

51:25.691 --> 51:29.129
Is it really that
good, Tyler, with her?

51:29.173 --> 51:32.828
'Cause I find that
really hard to believe.

51:32.872 --> 51:35.744
- You got a problem,
Elle, a serious one.

51:35.788 --> 51:37.616
Go home.

51:40.140 --> 51:42.490
- Frank wants me--
- Tell Frank you couldn't stay.

51:47.365 --> 51:49.628

51:49.671 --> 51:53.414
[Panting, sighing]

51:57.201 --> 51:58.245
[Sighing]

51:59.855 --> 52:01.118
- Can't take
the rejection?

52:02.989 --> 52:05.948
Elle, when are you gonna
realize he's not yours anymore,

52:05.992 --> 52:08.560
that he's done with the
toxic life you guys had?

52:08.603 --> 52:10.953
- You don't know anything
about what we had,

52:10.997 --> 52:12.520
except for the sex,

52:12.564 --> 52:14.957
which you obviously couldn't
handle hearing about.

52:15.001 --> 52:16.045
[Chuckling]

52:16.089 --> 52:18.222
- Elle, you need help,

52:18.265 --> 52:22.748
not so you can play games,
so you can get better.

52:23.836 --> 52:25.229
- Wow!

52:25.272 --> 52:27.056
That must get
really exhausting,

52:27.100 --> 52:28.841
hiding behind
that whole persona

52:28.884 --> 52:31.496
of wanting to fix people
when you're the broken one.

52:31.539 --> 52:32.801
But guess what?

52:32.845 --> 52:34.325
I saw the cracks

52:34.368 --> 52:37.197
when I was talking to you
about your parents,

52:37.241 --> 52:39.025
both trapped
under the boat.

52:39.068 --> 52:40.331
[Inhaling sharply]

52:40.374 --> 52:43.856
It's no surprise that
you cling onto Tyler

52:43.899 --> 52:45.727
like a life
preserver.

52:45.771 --> 52:49.209
But the problem is...

52:49.253 --> 52:51.298
no matter how
hard you hang on,

52:51.342 --> 52:53.735
you'll never give
him what he wants.

52:55.215 --> 52:58.131
And, eventually,
I'll hit that nerve,

52:58.175 --> 53:00.742
that one thing
that'll break you,

53:00.786 --> 53:03.963
and everything
will fall apart.

53:04.006 --> 53:07.706
And when that happens,
it's game over.

53:10.796 --> 53:14.713
Oh, and Karoline,
don't call me Elle.

53:20.719 --> 53:21.589
[Scoffing]

53:26.377 --> 53:28.901
[Chuckling softly]

53:31.251 --> 53:33.775
- Kara? Kara!

53:41.870 --> 53:44.482
Kara, wait! Kara!

53:47.311 --> 53:48.747
[Sighing]

53:54.056 --> 53:55.319
[Door opening]

54:00.715 --> 54:02.543
What were you doing
at the restaurant?

54:05.590 --> 54:07.592
- I saw you two, Tyler.

54:07.635 --> 54:10.334
- If you're talking about Elle,
nothing happened.

54:10.377 --> 54:13.075
- This is supposed to be
a happy time in my life,

54:13.119 --> 54:14.512
planning a
life with you!

54:14.555 --> 54:16.905
- And it still is.
- Really?

54:16.949 --> 54:18.951
When all we do
is talk about her?

54:18.994 --> 54:21.301
Not where we should
have the reception

54:21.345 --> 54:22.868
or who we
should invite?

54:22.911 --> 54:25.174
And instead of
making a guest list,

54:25.218 --> 54:27.786
I am documenting
everything that she does

54:27.829 --> 54:31.180
so, in case she goes off the
deep end, I have a record of it.

54:31.224 --> 54:34.358
- This is what she wants, Kara.
She wants us talking about her.

54:34.401 --> 54:36.490
So we just
need to stop

54:36.534 --> 54:39.232
and spend our time
doing exactly what you said...

54:41.190 --> 54:43.323
planning our lives together.

54:43.367 --> 54:45.673
[Sniffling]

54:45.717 --> 54:48.894
- She called me
Karoline tonight.

54:48.937 --> 54:50.548
[Sniffling]

54:50.591 --> 54:53.202
The only ones who ever called
me that were my parents.

54:55.030 --> 54:56.771
How would
she know that

54:56.815 --> 54:59.774
unless she was trying
to mess with my head?

54:59.818 --> 55:00.819
- Kara, please.

55:00.862 --> 55:02.299
[Crying]

55:02.342 --> 55:04.605
We can't
let her win.

55:04.649 --> 55:07.521
[Crying]

55:27.846 --> 55:31.980
[Whimpering]

55:32.024 --> 55:36.724
Oh no! No!

55:38.857 --> 55:40.946
Oh my God!

55:40.989 --> 55:44.341
[Sobbing]

55:48.040 --> 55:50.390
- Was there any sign
of forcible entry?

55:50.434 --> 55:53.175
- No! No, she was in my
house. I know that she was.

55:53.219 --> 55:55.656
- Well, is it possible
she still has access?

55:55.700 --> 55:57.745
- She gave me all the keys
after we split.

55:57.789 --> 56:00.226
But I don't know.
She may have made duplicates.

56:00.269 --> 56:02.184
- I recommend getting
your locks changed.

56:02.228 --> 56:03.316
- Yeah, of course.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.970
- So, are you
gonna arrest her or...

56:05.013 --> 56:07.799
- This documentation of
events you've created

56:07.842 --> 56:09.975
will definitely
help us build a case.

56:10.018 --> 56:11.977
- So, what, you have to
wait to build a case

56:12.020 --> 56:13.370
before you
can do anything?

56:13.413 --> 56:14.762
- We'll start an
official file

56:14.806 --> 56:16.329
in the hopes that
we can use it

56:16.373 --> 56:17.809
to secure a
restraining order.

56:17.852 --> 56:19.811
A lot of the times,
once that's done,

56:19.854 --> 56:22.335
the person sees they've
crossed the line and backs off.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.815
- And what if
they don't?

56:23.858 --> 56:25.773
- Let's just take it
one step at a time.

56:25.817 --> 56:28.559
But I assure you, we will
take it seriously, OK?

56:28.602 --> 56:29.560
[Sighing]

56:29.603 --> 56:31.170
- I hope you do.

56:40.527 --> 56:41.876
- What was that about?

56:41.920 --> 56:44.096
- I would have spoken
to you if you were here.

56:49.101 --> 56:53.018
- This is just some "he said,
she said." I'll take care of it.

56:53.061 --> 56:54.323
- OK.

56:57.718 --> 57:00.634
[Crying]

57:06.640 --> 57:09.426
[Panting]

57:22.047 --> 57:24.832
- Chief! Can I get you a table?
- I'm not here to eat.

57:24.876 --> 57:26.355
I just came
to inform you

57:26.399 --> 57:28.183
Isabelle won't be
working here anymore.

57:29.794 --> 57:32.405
I never thought
it was a good idea,

57:32.449 --> 57:35.756
but sometimes, Isabelle, ah,
she's got a mind of her own.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.323
- She sure does.

57:37.366 --> 57:40.805
- Well, at least now
everyone can relax

57:40.848 --> 57:42.850
and get on
with things.

57:42.894 --> 57:43.808
Understood?

57:48.377 --> 57:49.857
- Loud and clear.

57:57.038 --> 57:58.257
[Sighing]

58:06.178 --> 58:07.571
- You OK?

58:09.660 --> 58:10.704
- Great.

58:13.533 --> 58:16.188
[Sighing]

58:16.231 --> 58:20.540
Remember when I said there's no
point in going to the police?

58:20.584 --> 58:23.543
I got a visit
today from the Chief.

58:28.069 --> 58:30.855
He quit on Elle's behalf.

58:30.898 --> 58:34.249
So, as he put it,

58:34.293 --> 58:37.470
we can all relax
and get on with our lives.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.735
- So nothing's going to happen?

58:41.779 --> 58:42.606
[Bottle opening]

58:46.740 --> 58:47.915
- Told ya.

58:49.047 --> 58:50.657
[Scoffing]

58:50.701 --> 58:53.747
- I know what you told me,
Tyler, but we have proof!

58:53.791 --> 58:55.314
Documents, incidents.

58:55.357 --> 58:57.011
- We don't have anything,

58:57.055 --> 58:59.492
not according
to the Chief of Police.

58:59.536 --> 59:00.580
[Sighing]

59:00.624 --> 59:02.539
- So, what are
we supposed to do?

59:02.582 --> 59:05.150
Just accept the fact
that there's not gonna be

59:05.193 --> 59:06.978
a restraining order or charges,

59:07.021 --> 59:10.111
that she can damage
everything that we have?

59:10.155 --> 59:12.157
- What do you want me
to do, Kara?

59:12.200 --> 59:13.593
Tell me, 'cause
I'm at a loss.

59:25.910 --> 59:27.476
[Glass shattering]

59:41.969 --> 59:44.450
- Chief Lloyd! Can
I have a minute?

59:44.493 --> 59:46.060
- I have a minute.

59:46.104 --> 59:50.891
- Uh, look, I know that I
only counselled your daughter

59:50.935 --> 59:52.589
a couple of times,

59:52.632 --> 59:54.416
but she needs help.

59:54.460 --> 59:56.157
She's unstable.

59:56.201 --> 59:59.770
I mean, if you would just look
at the things that she's done--

59:59.813 --> 01:00:01.467
- Isabelle is fragile.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:04.601
And if I had known the
association with you and Tyler,

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:07.647
I never would've suggested
she seek church counsel.

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:10.389
- Isabelle is not fragile.
She is dangerous.

01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:13.522
I mean, I've obtained orders
of protection for far less.

01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:15.133
But I think
you know that.

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:17.701
- I hope you're not trying
to tell me how to do my job.

01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:19.964
'Cause we don't just hand
out restraining orders

01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:21.530
because of some
female rivalry.

01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:23.315
From what I read
in your documents,

01:00:23.358 --> 01:00:24.795
that's what
this is about.

01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:27.449
- How can you say-- This
isn't about a rivalry.

01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:30.670
This is about your daughter.
It is about what she has done!

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:33.020
- There's no proof that
she's done any of the things

01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:34.543
that you're
accusing her of,

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.850
so I suggest that you
get on with your own lives

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:38.722
and leave my daughter
the hell out of it!

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:57.044
- Ah, Kara! Have you
chosen another date?

01:00:59.133 --> 01:01:00.308
- I'm sorry?

01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:02.180
- For your wedding.

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:04.443
- I don't understand.

01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:07.141
- Your email indicated
that you had to cancel.

01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:10.231
- I never
sent an email.

01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:14.061
Are you sure
it was from me?

01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.498
- I--I don't know!
I assume so!

01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:19.458
Oh, Kara, don't tell me
that I misunderstood.

01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:22.113
Because your date, it's
no longer available.

01:01:22.156 --> 01:01:23.592
I--I'd feel terrible.

01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:24.942
- No, it's...
- Are you OK?

01:01:24.985 --> 01:01:26.291
- It's OK.

01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:28.641
No, it's fine.
Um, yeah.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:32.253
Of course, we'll
chose another date.

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:34.691
Thank you, Father.
- Sure!

01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:47.094
[Breathing heavily]

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:51.098
[Dinging]

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.899
- How do you want me?
- Just like that.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:11.249
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's hot.

01:02:11.292 --> 01:02:12.250
[Giggling]

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:13.512
- Come over here.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:21.085
[Gasping]

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:22.782
[Elle giggling]

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:35.534
- Kara?

01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:36.622
- Laura!

01:02:36.665 --> 01:02:37.710
[Sniffling]

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.973
Hi! Come on--Come on in!

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:42.454
- Is everything OK?

01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:44.673
- Yeah! Of course!

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:47.938
Um...

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.204
Um, I'm actually
glad you're here.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.383
I have a plan on how to
get you away from him.

01:02:58.426 --> 01:02:59.601
[Sighing]

01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:02.735
If you're willing.
Are you?

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.434
- Yes.

01:03:07.566 --> 01:03:09.176
- Good.

01:03:23.147 --> 01:03:24.801
[Sighing]

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:29.893
I offered my parent's place
to a client of mine.

01:03:32.765 --> 01:03:34.419
I think she needs
it more than we do.

01:03:37.639 --> 01:03:40.033
Besides, we don't have
a wedding date anymore,

01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:42.514
so it's not like we need
the money to plan anything.

01:03:46.648 --> 01:03:48.476
- I'm sorry, Kara.

01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.349
u deserve
better than this.

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:57.181
[Sniffling]

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:59.400
- Remember
what you said?

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.578
We can't let
her win.

01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:08.888
- I'm just afraid for
what this is doing to you.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.717
- I'm afraid of what
this is doing to us.

01:04:16.287 --> 01:04:17.592
[Sighing]

01:04:17.636 --> 01:04:19.246
[Sniffling]

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:33.695
- Wow! We can't seem to
stop running into each other!

01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:35.306
Creepy.

01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:37.917
Maybe you should get a
restraining order or something.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.353
- It's good to know

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:41.703
the Chief of Police
makes light of sociopaths.

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:42.879
- Who, me?

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:44.793
His sweet, reformed daughter

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:47.840
who insisted I volunteer
for the church bake sale?

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.450
Well, he couldn't be prouder.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:54.238
Make sure you try my
Spanish wedding cakes

01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:55.500
before they're
all gone!

01:04:59.112 --> 01:05:02.289
- It has everything you need
for you and your daughter.

01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:05.336
And the lot's been paid
till the end of the year.

01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:06.293
[Sighing]

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:14.780
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm!

01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:16.086
Ah!

01:05:18.218 --> 01:05:20.612
Can I come visit you once
you've settled in?

01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:21.918
- Of course!

01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:26.618
Oh, and Kara.

01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:28.141
Good luck
with everything.

01:07:08.937 --> 01:07:10.069
[Grunting]

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:11.418
[Screaming]

01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:13.594
- No! Get off of me!

01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:15.944
[Screaming]

01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:19.948
Stop! Get off me!

01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:24.692
[Grunting]

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:27.695
[Man panting]

01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:30.524
- Oh, you gotta learn
how to play.

01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:35.399
[Kara whimpering]

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:40.665
[Door closing]

01:07:42.232 --> 01:07:45.887
[Knife clattering]

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:47.324
[Sobbing]

01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:49.282
[Panting]

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.985
- Did he say
anything?

01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:58.204
[Sighing]

01:07:58.248 --> 01:08:00.337
- That I needed to
learn how to play,

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.295
like it was some
kind of game!

01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:05.472
- Have there been any other
incidents prior to this attack?

01:08:07.735 --> 01:08:09.476
[Scoffing]

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.131
- I submitted a whole
file of incidents.

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:14.960
Tyler's ex has
been harassing us.

01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:17.658
- Ex-girlfriend?
- Yeah, Isabelle Lloyd.

01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:20.921
- Who did you submit
this file to?

01:08:20.966 --> 01:08:23.099
- One of your officers.

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.448
Officer Peterson,
I think.

01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:28.843
- Can you explain
the harassment?

01:08:28.886 --> 01:08:31.629
- She--she destroyed
Kara's wedding dress.

01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:34.805
She--she sent her, uh,
a sex video of her and I.

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:36.154
- She even
killed my cat.

01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:38.026
[Sniffling]

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:40.158
- You have proof of this?
- Trust me, it was her.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:41.551
If you just
saw the file,

01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:43.770
it wouldn't be a surprise
that I was attacked.

01:08:43.814 --> 01:08:46.033
- We were told the restraining
order would happen,

01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:47.166
but it didn't.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.993
- Don't worry,
I'll dig up the file.

01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:50.822
- What am I supposed
to do until then?

01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:53.738
What if it's some kind of sick
game? Who's gonna protect me?

01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:56.523
- We'll set up surveillance.
We'll make sure you're safe.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.488
- I can't believe
this is happening.

01:09:06.316 --> 01:09:09.319
Why--why would somebody just
come into--come into our house

01:09:09.362 --> 01:09:11.321
and attack me?

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:13.801
[Hyperventilating]

01:09:13.845 --> 01:09:16.804
[Sobbing]

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:19.198
I'm sorry!

01:09:20.852 --> 01:09:24.421
- What are
you sorry for?

01:09:24.464 --> 01:09:25.683
[Crying]

01:09:25.725 --> 01:09:27.511
- I'm afraid.

01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:34.212
I'm afraid that this is
part of her twisted game,

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:36.259
and that it
is not over.

01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:39.000
- If she's responsible
for what happened to you,

01:09:39.044 --> 01:09:41.916
I swear not even her father
will be able to cover her ass.

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:51.883
- Peterson.
- Yeah.

01:09:51.926 --> 01:09:54.668
- Did you file a report
on Isabelle Lloyd?

01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:56.714
- No.

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:59.630
- But a complaint was brought
to your attention, correct?

01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:02.894
- Yeah, but Chief
took it over.

01:10:02.937 --> 01:10:05.201
- Of course he did.

01:10:08.726 --> 01:10:09.944
[Sighing]

01:10:09.988 --> 01:10:11.250
- Come in.

01:10:13.121 --> 01:10:14.949
Clemens, what
do you need?

01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:16.603
- The report on your daughter.

01:10:18.605 --> 01:10:19.998
- What's this about?

01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:23.175
- Kara Spencer was
almost raped last night.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.091
- It's amazing how trouble
just seems to find some people.

01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:28.093
- Maybe you didn't
hear me correctly.

01:10:28.136 --> 01:10:30.574
She was attacked and
almost raped in her own home

01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:32.010
by a man she doesn't know.

01:10:32.053 --> 01:10:33.707
I'm gonna need
any prior reports.

01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:35.492
- Well, there aren't any.

01:10:35.535 --> 01:10:38.364
- Kara Spencer didn't report
any harassment by your daughter?

01:10:38.408 --> 01:10:39.887
- Sure, she came in.

01:10:39.931 --> 01:10:41.889
I read the file,
but there was no evidence

01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:43.674
of any criminal activity
that I saw,

01:10:43.717 --> 01:10:46.459
just the rantings of a couple
of women out for the same man.

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:49.636
- Destroying personal property
and uttering veiled threats

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.725
isn't considered
criminal activity?

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:54.598
- I understand your need to
investigate this alleged attack,

01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:57.035
so why don't you and
your department focus on that

01:10:57.078 --> 01:10:58.645
and leave my daughter out of it?

01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:01.387
- There's clearly a pattern
of behaviour that's--

01:11:01.431 --> 01:11:02.997
- We're done here!

01:11:04.869 --> 01:11:07.175
- I'm gonna need an officer
for surveillance.

01:11:07.219 --> 01:11:08.786
- We're low
on manpower.

01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:13.051
[Sighing]

01:11:28.849 --> 01:11:30.286
- The detective
asked me

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:32.766
for everything that I have
documented on Isabelle.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:34.290
[Chuckling]

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:36.422
- Not surprising she
couldn't dig it up herself.

01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:38.250
[Sighing]

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.471
- Do you think they'll finally
take it seriously this time?

01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:44.909
- It's not about them taking it
seriously. It's about the Chief.

01:11:44.952 --> 01:11:48.652
- But this isn't about
accusations anymore.

01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:49.696
I was attacked!

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.178
What do--What do
I have to do,

01:11:53.221 --> 01:11:56.224
get raped or murdered before
somebody does something?

01:11:56.268 --> 01:11:57.835
- Hey, hey!
Don't say that.

01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.663
As long as I'm
here, you're safe.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.897
I'll see if I can get
out of work early tonight,

01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:18.899
maybe get some of
my shifts covered.

01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:22.033
- Oh, Tyler, I don't want you
to lose your job because of me.

01:12:22.076 --> 01:12:24.992
- Hey! You're more important
to me than anything, all right?

01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:26.603
Lock the door.

01:12:26.646 --> 01:12:29.170
Don't leave the house. I'll
be back as soon as I can.

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:51.105
- I'm sorry, Father Macey.

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:53.107
I know I have a lot of clients,

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:55.501
but I need to seek
other counsel for them.

01:12:55.545 --> 01:12:57.938
- Oh, well, is there a problem?

01:12:57.982 --> 01:13:00.071
- No, everything's fine.

01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:01.942
Um, I just--

01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:03.422
[Sighing]

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:05.598
I need to take
some personal time.

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:07.905
I hope you understand.

01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:10.429
- Of course. Our other
therapists can help.

01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:13.606
- Oh, but, um, I would like
to keep one of my clients.

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:15.129
Laura Fischer?

01:13:15.173 --> 01:13:17.480
- Oh, I'll be sure to
make a note of that.

01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:19.177
- All right, great.
Thank you.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.439
I'll talk to you soon.

01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:22.180
- Take care, Kara.
- Bye.

01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:53.080
[Clattering in distance]

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:13.013

[Ringing]

01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:27.419
- Kara, you OK?

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.291
- No. No, I'm not OK.

01:14:32.293 --> 01:14:33.686
I gotta get out of here.

01:14:36.123 --> 01:14:39.083
- Kara, just wait.
I'm on my way.

01:14:39.126 --> 01:14:42.434
- Tyler, you don't understand.
I can't stay here.

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:52.531
[Screaming]

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:54.098

01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:00.887
No! No!

01:15:05.022 --> 01:15:06.589
Get off of me!

01:15:06.632 --> 01:15:08.504
[Grunting]

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:11.550
Ah! No! No!

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:15.815
Help me! Help me!
No! No!

01:15:15.859 --> 01:15:17.774
[Grunting]

01:15:18.905 --> 01:15:20.472
[Whimpering]

01:15:24.389 --> 01:15:26.957
Please don't do this! Please!

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.568
No, please don't!

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:30.830
- Step away from her

01:15:30.874 --> 01:15:33.441
and put your hands up
where I can see 'em.

01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:36.140
- What's going on? Is
this some kind of setup?

01:15:36.183 --> 01:15:37.576
- You're
under arrest

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.187
for trespassing and
attempted bodily harm.

01:15:40.231 --> 01:15:42.886
- Look, I didn't do anything!
She asked for it.

01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:44.670
[Whimpering]

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:05.473
[Sighing]

01:16:05.517 --> 01:16:06.736
- Are you OK?

01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:07.780
[Whimpering]

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:09.739
[Breathing heavily]

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:10.914
[Sniffling]

01:16:10.957 --> 01:16:12.437
Was that him?

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.005
Was that the son of a bitch
that tried to rape you?

01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:15.962
- One of 'em.

01:16:16.006 --> 01:16:17.268
[Breathing heavily]

01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:19.705
- What the hell are
you talking about?

01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:22.621
- He claims he was
responding to an ad.

01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:24.580
- An ad to come and rape me.

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:26.669
- It's a good thing
I was watching.

01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:28.627
- Who did this?

01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:31.369
- Well, supposedly Kara.
- That's ridiculous!

01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:33.632
- According to our suspect,
he was emailing Kara,

01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:35.939
who sent him details
of her daily routine

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:37.505
so he'd know when to attack.

01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:39.638
- This is crazy!
Why would I want that?

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:42.119
- She would never do
anything like this.

01:16:42.162 --> 01:16:44.382
- And who would?
Your ex-girlfriend?

01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.776
I mean, I read the
documents you sent me.

01:16:46.819 --> 01:16:48.386
- So you believe me.

01:16:48.429 --> 01:16:50.997
- I believe there's a clear
pattern of behaviour.

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:52.608
- 'Cause she's sick!

01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:55.698
- Jesus! If she did this,
you need to arrest her.

01:16:55.741 --> 01:16:58.135
- Well, first,
I'm gonna need your permission

01:16:58.178 --> 01:16:59.919
to seize your
electronic devices.

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:01.704
Computers, laptops, cell phones.

01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:04.010
That way our digital
forensics team can get to work

01:17:04.054 --> 01:17:06.491
on eliminating either
of you as suspects.

01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:07.666
- Fine, here, take it.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.146
- You'll have
them back as soon

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:11.104
as any pertinent
information is downloaded.

01:17:11.148 --> 01:17:12.584
- And what
about Isabelle?

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:14.455
- We'll bring her in
for questioning.

01:17:14.499 --> 01:17:16.544
- For real this time?
- For real.

01:17:25.989 --> 01:17:27.512
- What are you doing, Dad?

01:17:29.079 --> 01:17:30.254
What are you doing?

01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:32.604
- Where are they?
Where are the drugs?

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.301
- I don't have anything.
- Bull!

01:17:34.345 --> 01:17:37.043
- Dad, this is crazy.
I don't have any drugs!

01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:38.784
- Then what the hell
are you doing?

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:40.743
I don't like being told
as a courtesy

01:17:40.786 --> 01:17:43.093
that my daughter's being
brought in for questioning!

01:17:43.136 --> 01:17:44.660
- For what?
I didn't do anything!

01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:48.794
- Just so you
and I are clear,

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:51.057
I cannot save you from
every crazy thing you do.

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:01.633
[Gasping]

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.679
You're wasting my time
and yours,

01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:06.769
which explains all of your
department's inefficiencies.

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:08.335
- We're just
following protocol.

01:18:08.379 --> 01:18:10.642
- Questioning someone
with no proof or priors.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.513
Protocol? That's
bull is what that is.

01:18:12.557 --> 01:18:14.428
- Especially when
I didn't do anything.

01:18:14.472 --> 01:18:16.082
- So you haven't
been harassing her

01:18:16.126 --> 01:18:18.563
even though her fiancé's
collaborated all accounts?

01:18:18.606 --> 01:18:19.825
- She's being paranoid.

01:18:19.869 --> 01:18:21.653
I mean, she may be a therapist,

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.481
but she's the one
with the issues.

01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:25.091
Just look at
her history.

01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:27.615
Mommy and Daddy dead,
leaving her an orphan.

01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:29.617
That's enough to mess anyone up.

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:31.358
- You seem to know
a lot about her.

01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:33.317
Is this including
her daily routine?

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.233
- You have no proof my client
had anything to do with that ad

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:38.801
or any of the other
accusations for that matter.

01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:42.369
- Isabelle, what do you know
about virtual private networks?

01:18:42.413 --> 01:18:43.457
- What the
hell's that?

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:45.068
- It's used when
you don't want

01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:47.679
your online activity to be
tracked, such as your emails.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.942
- Sounds clever.
- It is.

01:18:49.986 --> 01:18:52.510
Until our team unravels
it and finds the ad.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:55.818
- So, what you're saying is,
right now, you have nothing.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:58.777
- Actually, you should know that
all we need is enough reason

01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:01.693
to believe that Kara's life's
in danger to make an arrest.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.347
- Then go ahead!
Arrest my daughter!

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.003
That's what I thought.

01:19:08.918 --> 01:19:11.790
- I will be obtaining that
restraining order, though,

01:19:11.834 --> 01:19:13.792
the one that should've
been in place

01:19:13.836 --> 01:19:15.359
before that file got buried.

01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:16.664
- Knock yourself out.

01:19:28.502 --> 01:19:30.374
- What are you doing?

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:34.291
- I'm deleting all of my online
profiles so nobody can find me.

01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:36.597
[Computer chiming]

01:19:36.641 --> 01:19:38.382
[Sighing]

01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:42.473
[Sighing]

01:19:43.648 --> 01:19:45.345
- Don't worry.

01:19:45.389 --> 01:19:48.087
Det. Clemens said the
restraining order's been filed.

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:50.655
It should be delivered
in the next couple days.

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:54.180
- She told me, you know.

01:19:56.704 --> 01:19:58.445
About the sex
that you guys had.

01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:02.710
The fantasies.

01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:08.673
- We were also doing
a lot of other things.

01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:10.414
- I know that.

01:20:10.457 --> 01:20:14.157
But I still feel
the need to ask.

01:20:17.464 --> 01:20:19.945
Did you fulfill a
rape fantasy with her?

01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:23.470
Because I heard what she said
that night at the restaurant

01:20:23.514 --> 01:20:26.299
about you taking her
like she didn't want it.

01:20:26.343 --> 01:20:29.128
- I told you, Kara,
we were messed up.

01:20:29.172 --> 01:20:31.478
- I think you need to
tell Det. Clemens,

01:20:31.522 --> 01:20:34.133
because the more they have
to build a case against her,

01:20:34.177 --> 01:20:35.395
the safer I'll be.

01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:38.050
- OK.

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:47.451
[Sighing]

01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:53.761
- Would you be willing
to make an official statement?

01:20:53.805 --> 01:20:57.026
Thank you, Tyler.
Anything at this point helps.

01:20:57.069 --> 01:20:58.766
Bye.

01:21:00.246 --> 01:21:01.857

to trace 2 of
the outgoing emails

01:21:03.684 --> 01:21:06.383
back to St. Timothy's
church on December 1st.

01:21:06.426 --> 01:21:08.907
- So that means whoever
sent them had to be

01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:10.213
at the church
that day.

01:21:10.256 --> 01:21:11.605
- You got it!
- Thank you.

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:19.613
- St. Timothy's!

01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:21.180
- Yes, hello.
Is this Father Macey?

01:21:21.224 --> 01:21:22.878
- It is!

01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:25.141
- This is Det. Clemens
at the Special Victims Unit.

01:21:25.184 --> 01:21:26.446
Yes, how are you today?

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:28.144
- Well, and you?
- Good, thanks.

01:21:28.187 --> 01:21:30.320
I was hoping you'd
be able to tell me

01:21:30.363 --> 01:21:32.800
if you were at the church
on November 24.

01:21:32.844 --> 01:21:34.193
- That was our bake sale.

01:21:34.237 --> 01:21:35.716
- Oh, a bake sale, really?

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.979
- We have it every year.

01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:38.676
- Uh, do you happen to remember

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:41.809
if there was a young woman there
by the name of Isabelle Lloyd?

01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:43.376
- Yes. Is there a problem?

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.509
- No. No, nothing
to be concerned about.

01:21:45.552 --> 01:21:47.250
You've been very helpful
Thank you.

01:21:47.293 --> 01:21:48.251
- You're welcome.

01:21:48.294 --> 01:21:49.513
- Have a good day.

01:21:50.688 --> 01:21:52.516
[Door opening]

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.348
- We need to talk.

01:21:58.391 --> 01:22:00.654
[Sighing]

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.312
- Do you have
to go out tonight?

01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:08.793
[Chuckling]

01:22:08.836 --> 01:22:10.882
- She's my only
client, Tyler.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:14.103
I wanna make sure that she
has everything she needs.

01:22:18.368 --> 01:22:19.673
Don't worry.

01:22:19.717 --> 01:22:22.415
They have enough
evidence to arrest Elle,

01:22:22.459 --> 01:22:25.288
and they finally
tracked down all the men,

01:22:25.331 --> 01:22:27.899
so there's nobody
out there, not anymore.

01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:32.382
Come on!

01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:34.079
Go for your run.

01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:35.124
I'll be fine.

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:36.560
- All right, all right.

01:22:38.605 --> 01:22:39.911
I love you.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:41.347
- I love you so much.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.238
[Doorbell ringing]

01:23:03.587 --> 01:23:05.763
Tyler? You forget your keys?

01:23:33.399 --> 01:23:34.357
[Screaming]

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.272
- Bitch!

01:23:36.315 --> 01:23:37.708
[Grunting]

01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:40.232
I know what you're trying to do,
you psycho!

01:23:43.366 --> 01:23:45.629
- [Woman]: 911.
- Yeah, I'm being attacked.

01:23:45.672 --> 01:23:47.587
[Woman on phone, indistinct]

01:23:47.631 --> 01:23:51.330
She's not in the house yet,
but she's trying to get in.

01:23:51.374 --> 01:23:53.724
Just send--send the police.
195 Berwick.

01:23:53.767 --> 01:23:55.421
OK.

01:23:55.465 --> 01:23:58.207
[Breathing heavily]

01:24:04.822 --> 01:24:06.563
- Glass houses, Kara!

01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:10.915
That's what you've built, just a
glass house that's gonna break.

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:12.786
[Breathing heavily]

01:24:16.138 --> 01:24:17.443
[Breathing heavily]

01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:19.097
You surprise me, Kara,

01:24:19.141 --> 01:24:21.099
with how much spunk
you've actually got!

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:22.840
- Get out!
- Why?

01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:25.103
I've got nothing
to lose now, do I?

01:24:25.147 --> 01:24:26.887
The police are gonna
arrest me anyway,

01:24:26.931 --> 01:24:28.019
and you took care of that.

01:24:29.151 --> 01:24:31.762
[Screaming]

01:24:31.805 --> 01:24:33.677
[Elle grunting]

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:39.335
- Don't do this, Isabelle.
Your father can still help you.

01:24:39.378 --> 01:24:41.119
- I don't know, Kara.

01:24:41.163 --> 01:24:45.167
You've raised the stakes of the
game and made it pretty hard.

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:47.821
[Breathing heavily]

01:24:47.865 --> 01:24:49.345
[Breathing heavily]

01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:50.476
You won't do it.

01:24:52.174 --> 01:24:54.263
- You sure
about that?

01:24:54.306 --> 01:24:57.309
- Then go ahead.
Do it, you crazy bitch.

01:24:58.441 --> 01:25:00.399
- Well, you forced me.

01:25:03.533 --> 01:25:05.404
- If you think you've won,
you're wrong,

01:25:05.448 --> 01:25:07.580
because the truth
will come out.

01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:08.842
- Never!

01:25:11.845 --> 01:25:13.195
- Kara.

01:25:13.238 --> 01:25:16.111
- Tyler, she was
trying to kill me.

01:25:16.154 --> 01:25:19.418
- Kara, give me the gun.

01:25:19.462 --> 01:25:22.378
Elle put down the axe.

01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:24.684
It's OK.

01:25:27.687 --> 01:25:29.733
[Breathing
heavily]

01:25:29.776 --> 01:25:31.213
No!

01:25:31.256 --> 01:25:33.258
[Yelping]

01:25:33.302 --> 01:25:35.347
[Whimpering]

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:39.525
[Sobbing]

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:41.136
- Tyler!

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:43.834
Please, Tyler!

01:25:46.663 --> 01:25:49.361
[Breathing shallowly]

01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:11.340
[Door closing]

01:26:16.823 --> 01:26:19.043
- Have you eaten
yet this morning?

01:26:19.086 --> 01:26:22.307
- Not really. Morning sickness
has been pretty bad.

01:26:22.351 --> 01:26:24.004
- Don't worry,
it'll pass.

01:26:24.048 --> 01:26:27.182
And then I'm sure you'll
have all sorts of cravings

01:26:27.225 --> 01:26:29.575
for, like, pickles
and all that fun stuff.

01:26:29.619 --> 01:26:30.620
[Giggling]

01:26:30.663 --> 01:26:31.795
- Oh!

01:26:31.838 --> 01:26:34.232
A hot dog with sauerkraut...
- Mmm!

01:26:34.276 --> 01:26:38.018
- ... is all that I want right
now if I could stomach it.

01:26:38.062 --> 01:26:40.717
- I promise, when you can,
I will have it ready.

01:26:43.023 --> 01:26:46.288
You know, the Chief
called me. He wants to talk.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:50.901
- You think that's
a good idea?

01:26:50.944 --> 01:26:52.903
- What do you think?

01:26:52.946 --> 01:26:55.514
- I think he can't come to
terms with what happened,

01:26:55.558 --> 01:26:57.603
but talking to you
isn't going to help him.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.781
- See? You always
know what to do.

01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:05.655
You working today?

01:27:05.698 --> 01:27:08.005
- Yeah, for a few clients.

01:27:08.048 --> 01:27:11.095
- Well, then I'll
see you both later.

01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:12.096
[Giggling]

01:27:21.061 --> 01:27:22.585
- One, two, three, four.

01:27:22.628 --> 01:27:24.326
[Chuckling]

01:27:24.369 --> 01:27:27.503
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:30.332
That was so good!

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:33.073
Hey, sweetie, why
don't you go inside

01:27:33.117 --> 01:27:35.162
and get yourself
a snack, OK?

01:27:38.383 --> 01:27:39.776
- Hey!- Hi!

01:27:42.082 --> 01:27:44.476
- Have you heard?
- Yeah!

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.435
- Have any other
men contacted you?

01:27:46.478 --> 01:27:48.393
- No, not since I
took down the ad.

01:27:48.437 --> 01:27:52.919
Was it worth it, putting
yourself in that kind of danger?

01:27:52.963 --> 01:27:56.662
- I didn't have a choice.
She was never gonna stop.

01:27:56.706 --> 01:27:58.621
- Neither was
my husband.

01:27:58.664 --> 01:28:03.234
So don't worry. No one will
ever trace this back to us.

01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:07.107
- Thank you so
much, Laura.

01:28:07.151 --> 01:28:10.154
And you take care of
that beautiful family.

01:28:10.197 --> 01:28:11.155
[Sighing]

01:28:11.198 --> 01:28:12.243
- You too!

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.505
[Both chuckling]

01:28:13.549 --> 01:28:16.682
- Don't you worry,
I always will.

01:28:25.691 --> 01:28:27.214
Bye.

01:28:27.258 --> 01:28:28.607
- Bye!
