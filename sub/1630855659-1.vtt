so we can land it on the helicopter pad.

have we not heard about this place?

it's a Korean ownership group.

07:24.542 --> 07:25.542
Uh…

07:26.375 --> 07:28.167
I read about it before I got here,
because I--

07:28.250 --> 07:30.375
Before I get to places,
I like to, like, read up on it.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.000
You do the same thing, don't you?

07:32.083 --> 07:33.292
-No.
-[Kyla] Marcus!

07:33.875 --> 07:35.792
How the hell did you get us in here?

07:35.875 --> 07:37.250
I was talking shop with the manager.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.792
He said this is booked out
five years in advance.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.375
He-- He said five years, huh?

07:41.458 --> 07:44.000
I guess-- [chuckling] I guess I was lucky.
You know?

07:44.083 --> 07:46.375
It's so weird how lucky you get sometimes.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.292
Mm-hmm. Very weird, ain't it, baby?

07:48.792 --> 07:50.542
You know,
so I'm about to go take a shower,

07:50.625 --> 07:52.958

sitting on that plane.

Given the information in front of you,
is there any scenario

08:13.292 --> 08:15.375
where we don't drink this rum
right fucking now?

09:48.500 --> 09:51.167
-[Emily] Oh, God…
-Thank you for watching him last night.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.542
Hi!

09:52.625 --> 09:53.750
Aw.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.917
Man, we went hard last night.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.333
You should've seen Mommy talk her way
out of getting arrested last night.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.292
You would've been so proud.

10:01.375 --> 10:04.583
You guys, you thinking conch fritters
or something from the smoothie family?

10:04.667 --> 10:07.875
-Baby, something definitely fried.
-No, I want something healthy.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.208
I'll take a smoothie, please.

10:09.292 --> 10:10.333
-[Ron] Okay.
-I'm with her.

10:10.417 --> 10:11.625
-[Emily groans]
-Let's go healthy.

10:11.708 --> 10:13.458
-Why don't you make it two--
-[Ron] Okay.

10:14.250 --> 10:17.417
-What? Oh… Just someone…
-[Kyla sighs]

10:17.500 --> 10:21.292
[Ron] Ah, oh… See anybody in there? No?

10:22.208 --> 10:24.000
[Kyla] Yeah. I don't see anybody.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.167
-[Ron] Hmm. Just gotta find a waiter.
-[cell phone vibrating]

10:28.792 --> 10:32.958
[Ron] Oh, there-- I'm just gonna
send my vibes, I'm just gonna-- Nope…

10:33.042 --> 10:34.042
Zeke, what's up?

10:34.125 --> 10:36.083
First of all,
there's nothing to worry about.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.125
Yeah, man, everything's totally fine.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.292
Every time y'all say shit like this,
something fucked up has happened.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.208
Have you not checked your phone?

10:42.292 --> 10:45.000
We've been trying to reach you
for the last 24 hours.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.083
Yo, did you turn your notifications off
or something?

10:47.167 --> 10:49.042
Look, I don't know.
Maybe I did. What's up?

10:49.125 --> 10:52.750
The meeting with the CEO, Mrs. Kim?
It got moved up.

10:52.833 --> 10:54.875
<i>She's flying in this Tuesday.</i>

10:54.958 --> 10:55.958
Wha-- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:56.042 --> 10:57.583
-[Kyla] Oh, God.
-Why would they do that?

10:57.667 --> 11:00.917
All right, motherfuckers! What do we want?
We want breakfast coladas?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.167
[Zeke] <i>No idea, man. But I guess all of
the executives landed there this morning.</i>

11:04.250 --> 11:05.875
Lucky you're already out there, right?

11:05.958 --> 11:09.042
-Right there.
-No, no, no. No, no, no. Shit!

11:09.125 --> 11:10.542
-You okay?
-[Zeke] <i>Brother, chill.</i>

11:10.625 --> 11:14.083
We called to tell you we got you covered.
We even overnighted you the handouts.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.125
That's right.
No need to thank us or anything.

11:16.208 --> 11:19.208
I don't wanna thank y'all. Fuck y'all.
Look-- Whoa. Damn. Fuck. Fuck!

11:21.667 --> 11:24.458
Oh, you must be Mr. Parker.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.042
Fuck yes, he is.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.750
Ah! Ron, no.

11:27.833 --> 11:28.958
Yeah. But he's right.

11:29.042 --> 11:31.833
I am-- I-- I am Mr. Parker.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.083
My name is Goe.

11:33.167 --> 11:36.042
I'm from the advance team
for the Kim Wae Group.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.292
Wait. Are you the Kim Wae people--

11:38.375 --> 11:40.458
-Like is this your hotel?
-Mm-hmm.

11:40.542 --> 11:42.375
Okay, because I, for one,
really need to tell you

11:42.458 --> 11:44.458
how much fucking ass this place kicks!

11:44.542 --> 11:45.667
No, no, no. Hey, hey, stop!

11:45.750 --> 11:47.792
I mean, I love hotels.
I'm relaxed, I'm horny.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.875
I'm relaxed, I'm horny…

11:48.958 --> 11:50.833
-[scoffs] Sit down.
-…after a day in the sun, or three.

11:50.917 --> 11:53.042
-It's amazing.
-Y-You're not hiring, are you?

11:53.125 --> 11:57.583
[Marcus] Look, don't pay them no mind.
I'm sorry. Yes. How-- How can I help you?

11:57.667 --> 12:01.542
We merely wanted to extend our apologies
for the change in schedule.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.333
Again, thank you
for being so accommodating.

12:04.417 --> 12:05.917
Accommodating? Wait.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.708
The rum. The rum was from you.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.750
Yes. I hope you enjoyed it.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.500
Oh, enjoyed it? I mean--

12:11.583 --> 12:13.542
Wait. Was I on fire last night?

12:13.625 --> 12:14.750
Just your head, babe.

12:14.833 --> 12:15.708
You-- Don't listen.

12:15.792 --> 12:17.250
-They just be playing. [laughs]
-[Goe] Oh.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.708
And you know something?

12:18.792 --> 12:20.917
We was getting kind of busy,
'cause we about to get breakfast.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.750
So if we can catch up later today,
that would be…

12:24.833 --> 12:27.542
-[blows] That'd be perfect.
-[Goe] Oh, we hope to catch up tonight.

12:27.625 --> 12:31.958
Mr. Yeon, who is the lead on the Chicago
project, is very eager to meet with you

12:32.042 --> 12:33.583
before Mrs. Kim arrives.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.542
Mr. Yeon is our most senior
vice president.

12:36.625 --> 12:40.375
He's invited you for drinks
down at the lagoon tonight as our guests.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.208
All of you.

12:42.292 --> 12:46.083
-You don't have to invite all of us.
-[Goe] No, no, no, no. It's our pleasure.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.042
We insist.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.375
[sighs]

12:50.458 --> 12:54.125
Appreciate it. That's right.
We'll-- We'll be at the lagoon tonight.

12:55.917 --> 12:57.333
[Ron] What was that all about?

12:57.417 --> 13:00.125
I'm just confused.

13:00.208 --> 13:02.792
Marcus, why don't you just tell them?

13:02.875 --> 13:04.083
Tell us?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.542
Tell us what?

13:07.250 --> 13:08.250
Fuck!

13:12.500 --> 13:15.917
[Marcus] Okay, again.
This is a big deal for me and my company.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
So, everybody just please,
please be presentable.

13:19.083 --> 13:22.250
Ah, speaking of. Hold on. [chuckles]

13:22.958 --> 13:25.000
I knew I should've packed more clothes.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.750
Back to the baby carrier.

13:27.292 --> 13:28.417
-Oh? Oh!
-[Kyla] Oh!

13:28.500 --> 13:30.250
-Thanks, Maurillio!
-Maurillio, you're the best.

13:30.333 --> 13:33.333
-Baby, just get a drink.
-No, I don't wanna have a drink, baby.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.625
-I am hungover, and I'm nervous.
-[sighs]

13:35.708 --> 13:37.417
This isn't how
I pictured things going at all.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.542
-Okay, can you remember something for me?
-Thank you.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.042
That you are personable,
you are charismatic,

13:42.125 --> 13:43.667
and you are damn good at your job.

13:43.750 --> 13:48.042
Baby, I know, I know. I know I'm good,
but I have to be the best, okay?

13:48.125 --> 13:49.125
Picture your dick.

13:51.042 --> 13:52.167
-Oh, yeah.
-[Kyla] Mmm.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.000
Wait, what?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.458
It's exactly what we did
when we prepared for battle.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.083
Visualize to achieve.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.208
Marcus, you got more talent
in the tip of your dick hole

14:01.292 --> 14:03.208
than everybody at this entire party.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.500
I'm actually visualizing it right now.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.250
And, wow, it's a gorgeous dick.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.000
Stop it! Cut the shit.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.458
Stop it!

14:12.542 --> 14:15.625
I talked to y'all earlier, and I thought
y'all heard me loud and clear.

14:15.708 --> 14:19.167
I don't want you talking to nobody,
I don't want you making eye contact,

14:19.250 --> 14:22.833
and I especially don't want you
talking about my damn dick, okay?

14:22.917 --> 14:24.000
Ah, excuse me?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.958
Hi. You must be Marcus Parker?

14:28.625 --> 14:31.042
I'm Yeon, VP of properties at Kim Wae.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.625
Oh. [chuckles]

14:33.708 --> 14:34.708
[stammers] You're Yeon.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.417
First of all, what I was just--
What you was just hearing,

14:38.500 --> 14:40.958
that was me, uh, being funny.
You know, I was--

14:41.042 --> 14:44.375
I was just playing around with my friends.
You know, it's a little American humor.

14:44.458 --> 14:45.333
Oh, right. [chuckles]

14:45.917 --> 14:47.625
I went to college in Pittsburgh.

14:47.708 --> 14:50.375
I must've missed the class
on American humor.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.083
Damn. Uh, well,
I own a construction company.

14:54.167 --> 14:56.625
-I'm not a stand-up comic, so maybe I--
-Clearly.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.167
But check this out.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.542
I am excited to meet Mrs. Kim.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.500
When I tell you
this presentation is perfect,

15:05.583 --> 15:08.208
-I've been working on it for months--
-Mr. Parker, I'm-I'm sorry.

15:08.292 --> 15:09.583
Let me stop you right there.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.083
-Can I be honest with you?
-Of course you can.

15:12.167 --> 15:15.167
You are not my first choice for this job.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.500
-What?
-It's nothing personal.

15:18.583 --> 15:22.125
We just already have another candidate
we've worked with before.

15:22.208 --> 15:24.917
He's a real no-brainer, honestly.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.125
So, I don't know why
Mrs. Kim is making us go through this.

15:29.208 --> 15:32.250
Frankly, I find this whole thing
a little insulting.

15:33.417 --> 15:34.417
Is it…

15:35.042 --> 15:38.583
[chuckles] Is it insulting for you,
or is it insulting for me?

15:38.667 --> 15:41.750
Ah, for both of us.

15:44.042 --> 15:47.292
-Goddamn, that was honest. Okay.
-Anyway, nice to meet you.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.750
[stammers] Zero overages!

15:52.250 --> 15:53.458
Sorry, what?

15:53.542 --> 15:57.125
We took on 12 major projects last year
and had zero overages.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.125
-Really?
-Y-Yes.

15:59.208 --> 16:03.542
Uh, and I'm Emily, Marcus's wife.
And I can attest to that.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.292
And you are?

16:08.208 --> 16:09.208
Um…

16:09.792 --> 16:11.042
Um…

16:11.792 --> 16:13.208
I'm Kyla.

16:14.167 --> 16:16.500
And I am Ron.

16:16.583 --> 16:19.833
And you work with him, or…

16:19.917 --> 16:21.333
[Kyla] Mm-mmm.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.208
-[Ron clears throat]
-[Kyla] Mm-hmm.

16:24.292 --> 16:25.333
[in Korean]

16:27.667 --> 16:29.458
[in English] Oh, you can speak Korean?

16:29.542 --> 16:31.000
[Ron, in Korean]

16:46.500 --> 16:49.417
[in English] And I second that,
but make it a double.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.833
That was… esoteric.

16:55.125 --> 16:59.792
-But oddly impressive. As are you both.
-[giggling, speaks softly] Ooh, thanks.

17:02.833 --> 17:06.208
When the wind is right,
we will be releasing these lanterns.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.292
The flame represents happiness

17:08.875 --> 17:09.875
and good luck.

17:11.833 --> 17:13.708
Whew. Wow.

17:13.792 --> 17:15.458
[stammers] Ron, first of all,
thank you, man.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.167
How do you always pull that off?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.542
Okay, I'm going to let you in
on a secret, Marcus.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.208
I don't know if you've noticed.

17:23.458 --> 17:24.458
Everybody likes me.

17:25.750 --> 17:26.917
Come on now. Everybody?

17:27.833 --> 17:29.375
No, I'm serious.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.417
-[sighs]
-Every single person I have ever met.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.583
[giggles]
The crazy thing is he likes them all back.

17:34.667 --> 17:35.792
-Right?
-Oh, yeah.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.917
Okay, well, you can't possibly
like everybody back--

17:38.000 --> 17:39.500
No, Emily. I do.

17:41.042 --> 17:42.750
Every single person.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.792
-Every single person in the entire--
-What? Fucking hell!

17:44.875 --> 17:47.833
What's wrong with you people?
Come on. What are you doing?

17:47.917 --> 17:49.875
I'm-- I'm an invited guest.

17:49.958 --> 17:53.042
Okay, I'm not invited invited.
I'm just looking for somebody.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.875
-Okay, handsome, what's it gonna be?
-[Maurillio] What's up with that guy?

17:55.958 --> 17:57.458
Fifty, a hunny? Now you tell me.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.375
-You've got to be kidding me.
-[guest] What's wrong with you people?

18:00.458 --> 18:02.167
-No. No!
-[waiter] I gotta do my job.

18:02.875 --> 18:07.500
No, no, no, no, no!
What the fuck are you doing here?

18:07.583 --> 18:08.667
Fuck you, lady!

18:08.750 --> 18:11.125
Fuck me? Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of here!

18:11.208 --> 18:13.792
[chuckles] What? Are you going to make me?
What are you gonna do?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.083
I'll fucking kick your ass.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.083
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

18:17.167 --> 18:18.625
-Ooh…
-Ooh…

18:20.292 --> 18:23.417
Dad! Oh, my God! [chuckles]

18:23.500 --> 18:24.708
Oh, my God!

18:24.792 --> 18:27.250
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Wait. What?

18:27.333 --> 18:28.958
What do you mean what am I doing here?

18:29.042 --> 18:32.000
-That's her dad? I thought he was in jail.
-So did I.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.958
I'm glad you're here.
These guys wouldn't let me in.

18:34.042 --> 18:36.208
-Fuck you! And fuck you!
-What's going on with this place.

18:36.292 --> 18:37.500
-Dad!
-[laughs]

18:38.083 --> 18:40.292
Shit, that's Reese.
I'm finally gonna meet Reese.

18:40.375 --> 18:41.625
Emily, how do I look?

18:41.708 --> 18:43.333
-[Kyla laughs]
-What?

18:43.417 --> 18:45.125
Guys, look who it is! It's my dad!

18:45.208 --> 18:46.667
One-- One second, one second.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.875
Don't say another word. Marcus, right?

18:48.958 --> 18:49.958
Am I right? Oh!

18:50.042 --> 18:52.417
Fuck right off. You must be Emily!
[laughs]

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
[Reese] Maurillio.

18:53.583 --> 18:55.125
Oho! That mustache!

18:55.208 --> 18:57.792
-It's even better than Kyla said.
-Oh, thank you.

18:57.875 --> 19:01.500
Whoa! He's got your eyes.
The most beautiful eyes in the world.

19:01.583 --> 19:04.250
-Well, Dad, you haven't seen these eyes.
-[coos, chuckles]

19:04.333 --> 19:07.625
I want to introduce you to Ron.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.083
This is Ron?

19:13.958 --> 19:16.292
Kylie, you didn't say
he was a fucking gorilla.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.833
-[chuckles] Well, he's my fucking gorilla.
-Oh!

19:19.625 --> 19:22.542
Dad, he's my soul mate.
He's the love of my life.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.917
Hold on.
I thought I was the love of your life.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.125
Well, now I have two.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.125
Oh, Mr. Hackford.
Can-- Can I call you Reese?

19:29.917 --> 19:33.500
Whew. I cannot tell you
what an honor it is to finally meet you.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.208
Salaam.

19:41.292 --> 19:44.500
Uh, a kiss on the forehead.
That's the ultimate sign of respect.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.917
-Learned that from a sheikh in Kuwait.
-[Emily] Mmm.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.208
Okay, Ron.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.500
It's nice to finally…

19:52.583 --> 19:53.583
Blah, blah, blah.

19:54.417 --> 19:55.750
Don't worry. I approve.

19:57.167 --> 19:58.375
Or do I?

20:00.458 --> 20:03.750
-[laughing]
-[laughing] Did you see his face?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.042
[laughing] That was good.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.000
Goddamn it,

20:06.083 --> 20:07.792
-I can't believe I'm actually here.
-Yeah.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.708
-Yeah, you know, neither can we.
-Yeah, man.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.000
It's crazy that you-- That you're here.

20:12.083 --> 20:15.042
I mean, if you don't mind me asking,
why you-- why are you here?

20:15.125 --> 20:17.083
Guys, this is so fucking crazy.

20:17.167 --> 20:20.208
He was literally just released
from San Quentin.

20:20.292 --> 20:22.458
Just yesterday. Perfect timing, right?

20:22.542 --> 20:24.125
So, wait, Kyla, you told him to come here?

20:24.208 --> 20:27.250
No. I mean, all I told him was, like,
the hotel we were staying at

20:27.333 --> 20:29.583
and then, classic my Dad,
completely surprised us.

20:29.667 --> 20:33.375
Look, I have missed all the big events
in Kyla's life.

20:33.458 --> 20:37.417
You know, the birth of her kid, wedding,
graduation from CoolSculpting school--

20:37.500 --> 20:38.500
That one hurt.

20:38.583 --> 20:40.083
And her mom's death.

20:40.167 --> 20:42.833
May Jesus rest her beautiful,
precious, lovely soul.

20:42.917 --> 20:44.417
God, I hated that witch.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.708
So after all that, I had no choice.

20:46.792 --> 20:48.833
-I had to come crash her honeymoon.
-Right?

20:48.917 --> 20:52.792
-[chuckles] We are so glad you did.
-[Marcus] Can I tell you something though?

20:52.875 --> 20:57.333
This particular honeymoon is not the type
of honeymoon that you "crash."

20:57.417 --> 21:00.833
If you're worried about your, like,
"business stuff," please do not be.

21:00.917 --> 21:03.208
Because honestly, we're cool.
My dad's even cooler.

21:03.292 --> 21:04.708
Yeah, no, I'll be cool.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.917
Now where can an asshole like me
get a drink around here?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
-We need to get him a drink!
-I gotta work the room.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.042
-I'm going to the bar.
-No, no. Hey, brother.

21:11.125 --> 21:14.083
It's-- You don't wanna go that way.
We got liquor for you.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.917
-We got some rum. In the room.
-In the room.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.250
-No, we don't.
-No. We-- We drank it.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.958
-We get another bottle of rum…
-Yeah.

21:20.042 --> 21:21.250
…just for you to celebrate.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.875
-We're gonna celebrate him.
-Marcus, it's $700.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.000
It's $700. It's on me. It's on me.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.708
We gonna get another bottle for you on me.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.250
-Classy guy here.
-I know!

21:29.333 --> 21:30.583
-[laughs] All right.
-Okay, let's go.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.833
[Kyla] He's very nice.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.625
Thanks, Marcus. That's sweet.

21:33.708 --> 21:36.042
[shouting] Who also needs drinks?

21:45.375 --> 21:49.708
[laughing] <i>Dad, you're so funny.
I mean, come on though.</i>

21:49.792 --> 21:52.125
-You're such a cutie-pie.
-[baby Marcus cooing]

21:53.417 --> 21:54.875
[Kyla] You guys are so cute.

21:55.458 --> 21:56.708
[Reese] Okay.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.458
Oh, the rum is here.
I know where this is headed.

21:59.542 --> 22:00.542
[Reese chuckles]

22:01.167 --> 22:02.417
[Ron] Don't tell me, Reese.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.000
-You're a guy that likes it straight up.
-Nah, I'll just have a beer.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.542
A beer?

22:06.625 --> 22:09.833
So, Reese.
Um, you know, I hate to be intrusive…

22:09.917 --> 22:11.917
Oh, ask away. Open book here.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.292
So what were you in for?

22:13.375 --> 22:15.083
[scoffs] Nothing.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.125
Absolutely nothing.
I'm an innocent victim of the system.

22:18.208 --> 22:21.292
Okay, come on now.
You had to do something to go in.

22:21.375 --> 22:22.375
Here's a cold one, Reese.

22:22.458 --> 22:25.458
All right,
let me put it to you this way, Marcus.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.875
Kyla tells me you own
your own construction company, right?

22:27.958 --> 22:30.250
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, imports, exports.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.083
And so I get a little aggressive
with some tax write-offs,

22:33.167 --> 22:36.292
and all of a sudden I'm money laundering
with criminal intent?

22:36.375 --> 22:37.792
Bullshit.

22:37.875 --> 22:42.208
And now I have to make up
for eight fucking years of lost time.

22:42.292 --> 22:43.625
Aw…

22:43.708 --> 22:47.667
Speaking of,
I got you the best wedding presents ever.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.333
-My God. Give it to me.
-No, honey-- Okay.

22:49.417 --> 22:52.208
-I know how great you are with money.
-She's the best with money.

22:52.292 --> 22:53.625
Yeah, Ron. I just said that.

22:53.708 --> 22:56.792
But you have a family now, right?
With a kid to take care of.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.083
And you gotta start thinking
about your long-term financial security.

23:00.167 --> 23:01.833
-Right.
-Don't ask me how,

23:01.917 --> 23:07.333
but I got you in on an amazing,
rock-solid investment opportunity.

23:07.417 --> 23:08.917
-Ready?
-Yes.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.083
Crypto.

23:10.167 --> 23:11.750
I'm sorry. What?

23:11.833 --> 23:14.083
-Oh, cryptocurrency.
-No, I know what that is, but--

23:14.167 --> 23:15.542
Dad, I've heard of that.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.708
-Yeah, so have I.
-No, no, you haven't. No, no.

23:17.792 --> 23:20.333
-This is SCOM-coin.
-Did you say Scam-coin?

23:20.417 --> 23:21.625
No, SCOM-coin.

23:21.708 --> 23:24.833
-Scum-coin?
-No, no, no. S-C-O-M.

23:24.917 --> 23:26.458
Yeah, it's an acronym.

23:26.542 --> 23:27.708
-For what?
-For what?

23:27.792 --> 23:29.417
Fuck, I don't remember. [chuckles]

23:29.500 --> 23:32.750
But anyway, it's gonna be huge. Okay?

23:32.833 --> 23:36.250
All you gotta do is give me
like 40, 50 grand and boom!

23:36.333 --> 23:38.125
You are going to be so fucking rich
in no time.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.417
Dad, I'm crying. This is so sweet.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.250
It's the best wedding present ever.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.542
Okay, so I actually work in finance.

23:44.625 --> 23:46.125
Yeah. And I--

23:46.208 --> 23:48.167
I know you guys may think
I'm a little conservative,

23:48.250 --> 23:52.083
but the last time I checked,
cryptocurrency is insanely volatile.

23:52.167 --> 23:54.708
Yeah. They're awesome. [chuckles]

23:54.792 --> 23:57.125
Hey, trust me.
You're gonna want a piece of this.

23:57.208 --> 24:00.125
-Emily, trust him.
-[Emily] Oh.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.875
[Kyla] Also, I have a fun idea.

24:01.958 --> 24:03.958
-Emily, why don't we do it together?
-Yes!

24:04.042 --> 24:05.792
Oh, and Marcus,
I could tell the Koreans about it.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.625
-No, no. No.
-[Reese] It might help you out.

24:07.708 --> 24:10.458
Can we talk about--
We can talk-- We need to talk.

24:10.542 --> 24:11.750
-We should.
-Now we gonna talk.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.625
But you don't talk to nobody else
about this shit.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.208
Yeah, no. Okay, okay.

24:16.292 --> 24:17.583
-I'ma tell you this.
-T-Tell me--

24:17.667 --> 24:20.250
I want you to hear me.
I do not trust Kyla's daddy for nothing.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.583
Who goes to jail for eight years for,
what, tax write-offs?

24:23.667 --> 24:25.000
He went to San Quentin. Come on.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.125
You don't go to San Quentin
for no tax shit.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.750
-We should know 'cause we from Chicago.
-Exactly.

24:29.833 --> 24:32.167
You know he gonna stay here.
You know he plans on staying here.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.250
What was I supposed to do?

24:33.333 --> 24:35.083
I couldn't have him bro-ing it up
with the Koreans.

24:35.167 --> 24:38.208
You know what? Matter of fact,
this motherfucker didn't even try the rum.

24:38.292 --> 24:39.708
Hold up. Did we pay for that rum?

24:39.792 --> 24:41.417
-Yeah, baby.
-Did we pay for the rum?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.083
-I paid for the rum.
-What the hell?

24:43.167 --> 24:45.292
Fucking right, and I had to leave a tip.
Goddamn it.

24:45.375 --> 24:46.500
Calm down.

24:46.583 --> 24:48.917
You know what?
When we first met Ron and Kyla,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.708
we thought--
We thought that they were batshit crazy.

24:51.792 --> 24:54.500
-Yeah, we did.
-And you know what? We were wrong.

24:55.125 --> 24:57.458
No, we were--
Baby, we were-- We were right.

24:57.542 --> 24:58.833
Okay, but they're harmless.

24:58.917 --> 25:02.083
And so that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe Reese is of the same variety.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.583
A-And it's not like
he's gonna be in your meetings with you.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.208
-And that should be the plan.
-Yes.

25:07.292 --> 25:10.125
We need to keep him away from the Koreans.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.333
Okay, I like that plan.

25:11.417 --> 25:13.167
In fact, let's keep him as busy as we can.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.792
And we just pray
that nobody burns down the hotel.

25:15.875 --> 25:18.250
[squeals] Guys! Oh, my God.
There's a bonfire.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.333
-We're all going. Come on.
-[Emily] Bonfire? What?

25:23.083 --> 25:24.125
Wait.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.292
That's not a bonfire.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.167
Question. Um…

25:34.250 --> 25:35.833
Y'all wouldn't happen to know who--

25:35.917 --> 25:38.667
whose lantern it was
that-that caused this, right?

25:39.292 --> 25:40.875
[Yeon sighs] Nope.

25:40.958 --> 25:43.750
We just built this meditation temple too.

25:44.333 --> 25:48.083
Well, this is-- this is gonna have to be
a total rebuild, you know.

25:48.167 --> 25:50.583
From my professional opinion, you know?

25:50.667 --> 25:51.917
[Yeon] Shit!

25:52.667 --> 25:54.292
What the fuck, man?

25:54.375 --> 25:56.833
I told you not to do
the stupid lantern shit.

25:56.917 --> 26:00.333
Once the lanterns are lit,
you can't control the direction.

26:00.417 --> 26:02.625
You're making us look bad
in front of the Americans.

26:02.708 --> 26:06.000
You had to be like, "Yeah, it'd be good
to promote Asian culture.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.667
I used to do this when I was a kid."

26:07.750 --> 26:12.708
Do you know how bad it looks for a hotel
group to have a building burn down?

26:15.958 --> 26:17.875
[sighs] Ironic.

26:17.958 --> 26:20.958
The lanterns were supposed to be
a symbol of good luck.

26:23.667 --> 26:27.250
Goddamn. It is heaven
to eat with a metal fork again.

26:27.333 --> 26:31.000
I can't tell you what it's like
to drop a deuce with nobody watching.

26:31.083 --> 26:34.167
-[Ron] Deuce. [chuckles]
-I'm serious, Ron. It's not funny.

26:35.333 --> 26:38.000
Do you like shitting
in front of other people? I don't.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.417
[clears throat] Cool. Um…

26:39.500 --> 26:42.417
Well, look, um, what--
What plans do everybody got today?

26:42.500 --> 26:46.083
You know, is it-- You guys plan to do
something that's off the resort?

26:46.167 --> 26:48.250
Why? Why would you wanna leave this place?

26:48.333 --> 26:49.958
I'm never leaving. [chuckles]

26:50.042 --> 26:54.583
I mean, I've never been to the Caribbean
before, but this place is nice.

26:54.667 --> 26:56.542
You know, it's-- It's drug lord nice.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.708
I'm sorry. "Drug lord nice"?

26:58.792 --> 27:03.125
Emily, come on. These places
are like Soho Houses for all the heavies.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.208
The Barnes Brothers, Escobar.

27:05.292 --> 27:09.208
I wouldn't be surprised if Chencho himself
is with us in the hot tub tonight.

27:10.208 --> 27:13.958
-[whispers] Chencho?
-Chencho Novar. From Colombia?

27:14.042 --> 27:16.042
Ah, yes, Chencho Novar.

27:16.750 --> 27:19.125
I watched an entire documentary
about him once.

27:19.208 --> 27:22.042
So deadly, no one who has seen his face
is still alive.

27:22.125 --> 27:25.083
So scary,
nobody will utter his name in public.

27:26.083 --> 27:27.875
Although I-- I guess I just did.

27:27.958 --> 27:31.167
Okay, well, I-- I don't think we have seen
anyone like that around here.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.500
I suppose next they're gonna tell us

27:32.583 --> 27:34.667
that those aren't high-priced hookers
over there.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.542
Definite hookers.
They look extremely expensive though.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.125
And super niche.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.292
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna set up camp by the pool

27:41.375 --> 27:43.667
-and check out the merchandise.
-[Kyla] You earned it, Daddy.

27:43.750 --> 27:44.958
-Think of something.
-What?

27:45.042 --> 27:46.333
Oh, um, hey!

27:46.417 --> 27:47.458
Um…

27:47.542 --> 27:50.083
Why don't-- Why don't you guys go, um…

27:51.417 --> 27:52.417
go surfing?

27:52.500 --> 27:53.958
-Surfing!
-[Kyla] That is-- Mm-hmm.

27:54.042 --> 27:56.292
Let's go surfing. Let's do some surfing!

27:57.417 --> 27:59.625
Yo, Marcus. What's the room number?

27:59.708 --> 28:01.958
I'm having
another little wedding gift sent here.

28:02.042 --> 28:03.958
You don't have to do that for us.

28:04.042 --> 28:05.042
It's really for her.

28:05.625 --> 28:08.917
Okay, look. Just fill my name on it,
and they'll get it to me, okay?

28:09.833 --> 28:12.583
-Ron, look, thank you for doing this, man.
-Oh, yeah, man.

28:13.375 --> 28:15.417
I was kind of surprised to hear
you know how to surf.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.875
Nah, I don't know how to surf.

28:16.958 --> 28:19.125
I-- I'm not good.
I do some paddleboarding.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.208
Marcus!

28:20.708 --> 28:22.833
-Sometimes you gotta push your limits.
-Okay.

28:22.917 --> 28:24.708
[Ron] Look, I'm just glad to be out here.

28:24.792 --> 28:27.250
It gives Reese and I a chance to bond,
you know?

28:27.333 --> 28:29.083
Reese, I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

28:29.167 --> 28:32.125
I've heard so much about you through
the years and to finally get to know you--

28:32.208 --> 28:34.292
Wait. Are you sure
we're going the right way?

28:34.375 --> 28:36.000
Oh, yeah, I am.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.417
Checked the map at the front desk
before we left.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.792
Old habit I picked up in the service.

28:41.375 --> 28:42.542
Right. I heard.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.500
You're a park ranger.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.500
I am. Uh…

28:47.125 --> 28:49.333
It was-- It was before that. Like the…

28:50.667 --> 28:51.917
service service.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Special Forces.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.333
Yeah.

28:56.417 --> 28:58.125
Ah, I could've done that.

28:58.208 --> 29:01.292
I picked the hard road, pal.
Sales. Now that's war.

29:01.958 --> 29:04.542
What? Look, sales isn't-- It's not war.

29:04.625 --> 29:07.500
He actually fought in the war.
Like combat.

29:07.583 --> 29:08.833
Oh, my bad.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.792
So tell me,
have you ever killed anyone before?

29:14.167 --> 29:17.792
I don't relish in admitting it,
but yes, Reese.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.667
-Yes, I have.
-[chuckles] Okay, Ron. How many?

29:21.250 --> 29:23.958
[sighs] We don't really talk about it.
It's, uh…

29:24.500 --> 29:26.458
It's kind of a code we all live by.
We just--

29:26.542 --> 29:30.875
Code? And you can't tell us
because it's a secret code.

29:30.958 --> 29:32.958
Look, Reese, that is very disrespectful.

29:33.042 --> 29:35.375
You don't ask a soldier
a question like that.

29:35.458 --> 29:36.625
Forty-two.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.833
Damn. For real?

29:39.917 --> 29:41.250
Forty-two confirmed.

29:41.750 --> 29:42.750
A couple of "iffys."

29:42.833 --> 29:45.417
[chuckles] Okay, Rambo.

29:45.500 --> 29:48.792
What are you gonna tell me next?
You deserve a medal for bravery?

29:49.292 --> 29:50.583
Wow.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.708
I have eight of those, actually.

29:56.458 --> 29:59.375
[sighs] What a beautiful day.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.667
I guess. [chuckles]

30:01.750 --> 30:02.958
What's wrong with you?

30:03.042 --> 30:06.333
There was a striking young woman
at breakfast getting yogurt,

30:06.417 --> 30:09.458
and all I could think to say to her was,
"Mmm, strawberries."

30:09.542 --> 30:11.083
Mmm. That's not gonna get it done.

30:11.167 --> 30:13.333
It is still very early, okay?

30:13.417 --> 30:16.083
All you gotta do is be yourself. Okay?

30:16.167 --> 30:20.875
And I promise by the end of this week,
you are gonna be a stone-cold killer.

30:20.958 --> 30:23.083
-[Kyla giggles]
-Um, do you want me to be myself,

30:23.167 --> 30:24.625
or do you want me to be a killer?

30:24.708 --> 30:27.292
Because, Emily,
these are two very different things.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.333
[Emily] Oh, this is heaven. [sighs]

30:30.417 --> 30:31.500
Poor girl.

30:31.583 --> 30:34.792
If only she knew how much Ron
and I assed up that chair the other night.

30:48.833 --> 30:50.917
You don't think these waves are too big?

30:51.708 --> 30:52.875
[Ron] I can't tell.

30:52.958 --> 30:56.417
-I mean, those guys are out there.
-[Marcus] Those guys are fucking crazy.

30:56.500 --> 30:59.750
-I'm not going in that shit.
-What? Are you guys scared?

30:59.833 --> 31:00.958
Not at all.

31:01.042 --> 31:03.542
But even in the best conditions,
you have to be careful.

31:04.125 --> 31:06.375
She's a fickle mistress.
You gotta respect her.

31:07.042 --> 31:08.917
You gotta listen to
what she's telling you.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.167
She?

31:11.167 --> 31:12.417
The natural world, Reese.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.667
And if you just be patient,
she'll reveal all the mysteries to you.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.708
It's what I've dedicated my life to.

31:19.292 --> 31:20.292
Like that.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.167
-See that bird there?
-[Reese] Yeah?

31:23.750 --> 31:25.167
I can tell from here.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.417
-That bird's about to shit.
-Hey, Jerome!

31:27.917 --> 31:29.958
Jerome, there you are.

31:30.583 --> 31:31.750
Damn it! I had him.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.333
Hey, tell me if you see another bird.

31:34.417 --> 31:37.458
-Tell me, how we doing this?
-Brother, this thing is a bad idea.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.000
For why you even want to involve Warren?

31:40.083 --> 31:42.875
Because I'm trying go
through the proper channels here.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.917
-[whispers] Oh, man.
-That way we get paid,

31:45.000 --> 31:46.833
and we keep our heads on.

31:46.917 --> 31:48.083
-No, no.
-You don't understand.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.958
I have to get that money.
Look, tell him I have the coordinates.

31:51.042 --> 31:54.333
-[Reese speaking indistinctly]
-[Marcus] How-How does he know this guy?

31:54.417 --> 31:56.958
He said he'd never been
to the Caribbean before.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.750
[panting]

31:58.833 --> 32:00.458
Mr. Parker.

32:00.542 --> 32:01.792
Ron.

32:01.875 --> 32:03.042
[in Korean] Hello.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.625
[in English] What are you two doing
on the backside of the island?

32:06.708 --> 32:08.333
We-- We-- You know something?

32:08.417 --> 32:10.708
We about to get our surf on.
We about to do some surfing.

32:10.792 --> 32:13.500
Ah. I didn't know you surfed.

32:13.583 --> 32:17.208
-That's unusual for someone from Chicago.
-That's not unusual. You know something?

32:17.292 --> 32:19.875
I'm-- I'm a little more
than somebody just from Chicago.

32:19.958 --> 32:20.833
Huh.

32:20.917 --> 32:22.875
Matter fact, it looks intimidating,
but it's not.

32:22.958 --> 32:24.833
You know?
All you gotta do is push your limits.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.250
That's right. Like my friend Ron says.

32:26.333 --> 32:27.667
Right, Ron?

32:27.750 --> 32:29.542
What? Oh. Yes.

32:29.625 --> 32:30.875
That's what-- Yep, yep.

32:30.958 --> 32:33.750
-I like people who push their limits.
-Hell yeah.

32:33.833 --> 32:37.250
All right. Well, uh, we better keep
the pace up before we tighten up.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.417
-Do that. We're gonna do some surfing.
-[in Korean] Let's go!

32:39.500 --> 32:41.750
-[Goe, in English] Okay. Let's go.
-Hey, fools, back to the hotel.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.292
Chop, chop. Let's go.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.875
Wait, wait. You're going back?

32:47.708 --> 32:50.083
Because you just said
you were gonna jump in.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.292
So, are you surfing
or are you not surfing?

32:52.375 --> 32:55.625
-Yeah, that's--
-[chuckles] Are you kidding me?

32:55.708 --> 32:58.583
These two caked their trunks
the second they saw the waves.

32:58.667 --> 33:01.000
Caked? Me?

33:01.083 --> 33:03.875
What? You're telling me now
that you're not chickening out?

33:03.958 --> 33:06.250
As a matter of fact, Reese,
I'm going for it right now.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.500
Let's do this, Marcus.

33:10.167 --> 33:11.208
[chuckles]

33:13.000 --> 33:14.458
[whispering] Fuck.

33:14.542 --> 33:17.083
[Kyla] Okay, have a good nap, sweetie.

33:18.458 --> 33:22.125
Oh. Isn't he just the most beautiful thing
in the entire world?

33:22.208 --> 33:23.083
[sighs]

33:25.625 --> 33:26.625
You okay?

33:29.083 --> 33:32.042
-I don't wanna have a baby.
-[chuckles] Me neither right now.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.958
No, I mean, like, ever.

33:34.042 --> 33:35.125
Like, of my own.

33:35.208 --> 33:36.708
-Wait. Are you serious?
-Yeah.

33:36.792 --> 33:38.417
I just saw you with baby Marcus.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.125
You were just incredible.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.917
I know! I love kids.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.167
And Marcus and I
have always talked about having them,

33:44.250 --> 33:45.833
but now that the moment is here,

33:45.917 --> 33:49.208
I realized I never actually envisioned
myself carrying these babies.

33:49.292 --> 33:51.958
You've gone through the process.
You know what it does to your body.

33:52.042 --> 33:53.417
-Sweetheart, it's fucking hell.
-[sighs]

33:53.500 --> 33:56.833
I had a stage three tear, which means
I pissed and shit at the same time.

33:56.917 --> 33:59.083
-Oh, my God.
-You're gonna love it.

33:59.667 --> 34:00.792
[sighs]

34:00.875 --> 34:03.292
I just love my life the way it is now.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.083
I know it sounds selfish. I know.

34:05.167 --> 34:08.500
I can hear it. But I feel like
a baby would just ruin all of that.

34:08.583 --> 34:10.833
And I am the happiest
I have ever, ever been.

34:11.958 --> 34:12.958
Does Marcus know?

34:13.667 --> 34:15.667
The man with the ovulation tracker
on his phone?

34:15.750 --> 34:17.250
No, he doesn't know.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.792
I don't want to be a negative Nancy,
but you do have to tell him.

34:19.875 --> 34:23.250
-It would literally break his heart.
-Can I just say something?

34:23.333 --> 34:26.083
I don't know why
I'm not eloquent or smart enough

34:26.167 --> 34:28.458
to be able to say the kind of,
like, badass feminist thing

34:28.542 --> 34:31.333
that I wish I could say now,
but I'm proud of you for knowing yourself.

34:31.417 --> 34:34.542
And secondly, you know,
I think he's gonna understand.

34:34.625 --> 34:37.083
Come on. I mean, do you really think
he's gonna lose his shit?

34:37.167 --> 34:40.417
[screams] Ah! No!

34:40.500 --> 34:41.667
Ron, what the fuck?

34:41.750 --> 34:44.292
Okay. Could be a little tough
paddling out.

34:44.375 --> 34:48.000
[grunts] Man, fuck this!
Okay, why don't we go back? Huh?

34:48.083 --> 34:50.833
We can come up with something.
Say it's a rip current, or something.

34:50.917 --> 34:52.292
Man, you heard Reese.

34:52.375 --> 34:54.917
-I can't chicken out now.
-Who gives a fuck what he thinks?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.417
You kind of cared
what your father-in-law thought, huh?

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
I don't know
if you picked up on it back there.

34:59.583 --> 35:03.417
It was kind of subtle, but it just seems
like Reese and I aren't connecting.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.583
I knew it. Chickenshit.

35:05.667 --> 35:08.083
Great. So now
what the fuck am I supposed to do then?

35:08.167 --> 35:10.125
Go back up there alone? And look at--

35:11.083 --> 35:13.542
This motherfucker's filming us. Fuck!

35:13.625 --> 35:16.000
There's only one thing left to do, Marcus.

35:16.833 --> 35:18.167
Surf.

35:18.750 --> 35:19.750
Hell no!

35:19.833 --> 35:23.042
-Come on. You did paddleboarding.
-Twice! In a lake!

35:23.125 --> 35:25.125
Look at that set, Marcus.

35:25.208 --> 35:29.000
This may be the only chance in your life
to ride something that fucking perfect.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.792
Once you're out there,
your instincts will kick in,

35:31.875 --> 35:34.292
and then you'll just be one with the wave.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.500
-Are you sure about this?
-Believe in yourself! You can do this!

35:37.583 --> 35:39.792
-I can do this. I can do this.
-You can do this!

35:39.875 --> 35:41.042
-Yes!
-We're going out there,

35:41.125 --> 35:42.917
-and we're going surfing.
-Yes!

35:43.000 --> 35:44.167
Yes!

come out of a person before.

Did I-- Did I throw up a lot?

36:34.625 --> 36:36.375
Then where did the water come from?

36:57.667 --> 36:59.833
So, how's it going with my dad?

37:02.167 --> 37:04.042
It's going. It's good.

37:04.125 --> 37:07.125
It seems like you guys have, like,
really had a chance to bond.

37:07.208 --> 37:10.958
-Yeah. Yeah, totally bonding. Yeah.
-Oh, thank God!

37:11.667 --> 37:14.542
-I'm so relieved.
-Huh? What?

37:14.625 --> 37:19.292
I don't know if it was, like, my weird
psychic ability kind of flaring up,

37:19.375 --> 37:22.417
but I did have a moment where
I was looking at you, and I was like,

37:22.500 --> 37:25.083
"Oh, my God. I love him so much."

37:25.167 --> 37:27.875
Then I was looking at my dad, and I was,
"Oh, my God. I love him so much."

37:27.958 --> 37:29.875
Then I was looking at you two together
and was like,

37:29.958 --> 37:32.583
"Oh, my God. What if they don't love
each other so much?"

37:33.292 --> 37:34.875
Yeah. A nightmare, right? [laughs]

37:34.958 --> 37:37.542
[laughs] I know! A total nightmare.
It was a total nightmare.

37:37.625 --> 37:41.417
And it got me thinking about Sue's dad
doesn't get along with her husband,

37:41.500 --> 37:43.125
and that's why she got cystic acne

37:43.208 --> 37:44.833
and started collecting
those little glass cats.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.292
And everyone's just worried about her.

37:46.375 --> 37:48.458
I was like,
"I don't want that to happen to me."

37:48.542 --> 37:51.375
But then I'm like,
"I'm just being crazy," because…

37:52.167 --> 37:55.333
you're Ron, and everyone loves you.

37:55.417 --> 37:58.042
Ha! Not literally everyone, you know.

37:58.125 --> 38:01.625
Literally everyone. Every single person.

38:02.542 --> 38:04.375
And that's why I love you.

I will never, ever, ever, ever,
ever suggest surfing again.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.625
Good. 'Cause I don't want to even hear
the word surfing. You know what I mean?

38:15.708 --> 38:17.667
Look, I had to do
whatever I had to do to--

38:17.750 --> 38:21.250
to get rid of Kyla's fucking
shady-ass father somehow. You know?

38:21.333 --> 38:23.250
Well, you don't have to worry
about him tonight.

38:23.333 --> 38:26.125
Apparently he already got plans.
Some business thing.

38:26.208 --> 38:28.458
Ah, thank God. [groans]

38:29.083 --> 38:32.625
[exhales sharply] Okay, so what, uh--
What you had going on today?

38:32.708 --> 38:33.750
Yeah, it was good.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.167
-You know, we just kicked it by the pool…
-Mmm.

38:36.250 --> 38:37.833
…just talked about stuff.

38:37.917 --> 38:42.375
-Stuff? Like, what type of stuff?
-[smacks lips] Baby, you know.

38:42.458 --> 38:47.333
Girl stuff,
some personal stuff, some deep stuff.

38:48.625 --> 38:51.000
-[cell phone chimes]
-[automated voice] <i>You are ovulating.</i>

38:51.083 --> 38:52.208
[Marcus] Shit! Goddamn it!

38:52.292 --> 38:54.667
Oh, you guys just go at it.
I'll turn the music up.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.083
[cell phone ringing]

38:56.167 --> 38:57.542
[Marcus] What? Hold on.

38:58.583 --> 38:59.583
Hello?

38:59.667 --> 39:01.208
Mr. Parker, it's Yeon.

39:01.292 --> 39:02.833
Hey, man.

39:02.917 --> 39:04.667
Yeon, what's going on, brother?
How you doing?

39:04.750 --> 39:09.083
Mrs. Kim wanted me to check
that you are still, well, alive.

39:09.167 --> 39:11.583
-You told her about that today?
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

39:11.667 --> 39:14.458
I sent her the video.
Uh, it made quite the impression.

39:15.042 --> 39:16.958
<i>I wish I could say
she found your effort admirable,</i>

39:17.042 --> 39:19.792
but really she was just concerned
about your well-being.

39:19.875 --> 39:22.125
She said that if you wanted
to cancel your presentation--

39:22.208 --> 39:23.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can-- No, no, no.

39:24.042 --> 39:26.250
We're not using that word here.
We're not canceling anything.

39:26.333 --> 39:29.167
You know, 'cause-- 'cause guess what?
I'm-- Pfft. I am--

39:29.250 --> 39:31.792
-[stomach gurgles]
-I am great. I am so fine.

39:31.875 --> 39:33.292
You're totally fine?

39:33.375 --> 39:35.958
Matter of fact, I was telling my wife
how bad I want to go surfing again.

39:36.042 --> 39:37.333
-What?
- <i>Really?</i>

39:38.167 --> 39:39.583
Well, I wasn't gonna offer this,

39:39.667 --> 39:42.042
but the group and I,
we're going to the casino tonight.

39:42.125 --> 39:44.625
<i>You and your guests
are more than welcome to join, of course.</i>

39:44.708 --> 39:48.292
But, uh, if you can't make it…
[smacks lips] …that's totally fine.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.000
No, no, no. Ain't no buts. [chuckles]

39:50.083 --> 39:53.875
We-- We would love to meet y'all
at the casino tonight.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.375
Okay. Well, I'll see you there then.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.208
-Bye.
-[stomach gurgles]

39:59.083 --> 40:01.250
[groans]
Okay, that was a lot, holding that in.

40:01.333 --> 40:03.708
Uh-uh. You can't go out.
You can't even walk.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.417
-I can walk. Watch. Watch me walk.
-[stomach gurgles]

40:07.083 --> 40:09.750
-See? I'm walking to the bathroom.
-Oh! Oh, baby.

40:15.042 --> 40:17.708
-[slot machines pinging]
-[patrons talking indistinctly]

40:21.500 --> 40:23.167
-[whispers] Wow!
-Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

40:23.667 --> 40:24.958
This place is nicer than Reno.

40:25.042 --> 40:27.833
Okay. And look, guys,
I want all of us to have fun tonight,

40:27.917 --> 40:29.333
but the Kim Wae people are here,

40:29.417 --> 40:31.167
and I want to make
a good impression. Okay?

40:31.250 --> 40:33.708
Got you.
You want us to get super fucked up.

40:33.792 --> 40:36.708
Let's score some Molly, and maybe
we could pitch Yeon on a hot three-way.

40:36.792 --> 40:38.500
-No, no, no, no. Hell no.
-No.

40:38.583 --> 40:41.208
I'm kidding. I'm not drinking tonight.
We've got our child here.

40:41.292 --> 40:42.625
Come on. We're not monsters.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.917
[laughs]
How's that fucking ass tonight, buddy?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.583
You ready to get spanked?

40:46.667 --> 40:47.833
Four hundred for us.

40:47.917 --> 40:49.583
Let me go find Yeon. I'll be back.

40:49.667 --> 40:51.167
Come on, Em. You wanna play? Come on.

40:51.250 --> 40:54.625
Actually, I don't really see
the appeal of gambling.

40:54.708 --> 40:58.583
What? Come. Let mama show you.
You just have to know how to play.

40:59.083 --> 41:01.875
Sir, you can't have a baby at the table.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.792
-[groans]
-[stomach gurgles]

41:05.875 --> 41:07.125
[Yeon] Good.

41:07.208 --> 41:08.958
Hey! Hey, Marcus!

41:09.792 --> 41:12.250
-Marcus!
-Yeon.

41:12.333 --> 41:14.375
-Hey, come over here.
-[in Korean] Come here, come here.

41:14.458 --> 41:16.625
-[Yeon, in English] Yeah, yeah! Sit, sit.
-[in Korean] Go, go.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.958
[in English] How you doing?
What's going on?

41:19.042 --> 41:21.375
-Sit, sit, Marcus.
-[Goe, in Korean] Sit down. Sit down.

41:21.458 --> 41:23.333
-[in English] What's going on?
-Come play with us.

41:23.417 --> 41:26.917
-Play what?
-[in Korean] A drinking game, Mr. Parker.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.250
[mutters]

41:28.333 --> 41:30.917
[in English]
What we call after-work drinks.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.750
This is how we bond in our business.

41:32.833 --> 41:35.667
-It's a company tradition. [chuckles]
-[Goe chuckles]

41:35.750 --> 41:37.250
-Huh.
-[Goe, in Korean] Get ready.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.333
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

41:48.458 --> 41:51.708
-Ah! [laughs]
-[in English] I win again! You all suck!

41:51.792 --> 41:52.958
You all suck!

41:53.042 --> 41:55.667
[all laughing]

42:00.375 --> 42:02.000
[laughter ends]

42:02.083 --> 42:05.583
[Marcus continues laughing] He was-- He--

42:07.125 --> 42:08.167
[Yeon clears throat]

42:10.875 --> 42:11.875
Oh.

42:13.500 --> 42:14.958
These were for me?

42:17.000 --> 42:18.500
No, I'm not drinking tonight, man.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.875
I'm taking a break.
I'm on a-- I'm on a drink fast.

42:21.917 --> 42:23.083
Excuse me?

42:23.167 --> 42:26.000
Okay, look,
I'm not trying to offend any of y'all.

42:26.083 --> 42:29.750
Especially you, Yeon.
But I-- I cannot do this tonight.

42:29.833 --> 42:31.500
This is how we bond.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.375
Are you saying
you don't want to bond with us?

42:35.458 --> 42:37.958
No! Come on now. I just can't drink, okay?

42:38.042 --> 42:40.875
I said it's a company tradition.

42:41.458 --> 42:43.292
Somebody has to play.

42:45.458 --> 42:47.208
Twenty again? Shit!

42:47.292 --> 42:51.542
Ron, Ron! Wait. Why you and the baby--
Look, no, fuck that-- I need you to drink.

42:51.625 --> 42:53.417
[chuckles]
Marcus, you told me specifically--

42:53.500 --> 42:55.958
I know what I said, damn it!
Come with me. Come now.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.500
Mmm. So, babe, oh, my God. It looked like
Marcus took your talk really well.

43:01.583 --> 43:03.667
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

43:03.750 --> 43:05.250
Because we didn't have it.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.208
I just wanna make sure
I'm assessing this correctly.

43:08.292 --> 43:11.917
-This is a-- This is a drinking game?
-Yes. I need you to pinch hit for me.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.500
No, Marcus. If I do something like this,
I'm gonna have to unleash the beast.

43:15.583 --> 43:17.750
Are you comfortable with that? Yes or no?

43:17.833 --> 43:19.042
In this case…

43:21.083 --> 43:22.083
yes.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
All right, you fucking pussies.

43:29.042 --> 43:33.500
-Let's do this.
-No. It's you who's the pussy.

43:35.333 --> 43:37.875
[in Korean] Hey, okay, get ready!

43:37.958 --> 43:39.083
All right.

43:44.958 --> 43:46.208
Cheers!

43:51.708 --> 43:54.167
[shouts, speaks in English] Suck it!

43:54.750 --> 43:57.875
Fuck yeah! [laughs]

44:00.208 --> 44:02.000
[in Korean]

44:10.167 --> 44:12.000
[in English] Get Minjin.

44:13.458 --> 44:16.792
I saw it in his eyes. I know
how much he wants this baby, and I just--

44:16.875 --> 44:18.792
I couldn't do it to him.
I couldn't break his heart.

44:18.875 --> 44:22.042
-[dealer] Nineteen. Dealer wins.
-You're on fucking notice, dude.

44:22.958 --> 44:25.833
But I mean, it's also so confusing.

44:25.917 --> 44:30.250
So, I think that this is
just one of those moments in life

44:30.333 --> 44:33.042
-where you have to listen to that wisdom…
-[sighs] Mmm.

44:33.125 --> 44:35.875
…that is deep within your soul that says,

44:35.958 --> 44:38.583
-"You cocksucker."
-I'm sorry. What?

44:38.667 --> 44:39.750
You cocksucker!

44:39.833 --> 44:41.833
I see exactly what it is
that you're doing.

44:41.917 --> 44:43.417
Excuse me, ma'am?

44:43.500 --> 44:46.208
You're not showing us your cards
until after we find out what ours are.

44:46.292 --> 44:48.917
-You know what? You gotta go first.
-Ma'am, ma'am, don't--

44:49.000 --> 44:51.167
-[Kyla] Just go first.
-Don't touch the cards.

44:52.083 --> 44:55.250
-Great. You just burned the deck.
-Hey, sorry.

44:55.333 --> 44:58.333
[clears throat]
I thought you said you knew how to play.

44:58.417 --> 45:00.458
I do know how to play.
All the face cards were out.

45:00.542 --> 45:03.208
The shoe was absolutely fucked,
and I had to do something.

45:03.292 --> 45:05.750
My tits are on fire. I gotta go pump.

45:05.833 --> 45:06.667
I'll be right back.

45:06.750 --> 45:11.250
Okay, so whenever the low cards come out,
that's when you go deep. Trust me.

45:12.333 --> 45:13.750
Uh-huh.

45:13.833 --> 45:16.250
[crowd cheering]

45:16.583 --> 45:20.917
[Yeon, in Korean]

45:21.000 --> 45:23.958
-[in English] Okay, we end this right now.
-Fuck that, dude. I got this!

45:24.042 --> 45:26.625
Listen to me, damn it!
Alcohol poisoning is fucking dangerous.

45:26.708 --> 45:29.292
-You get what I'm saying?
-Dude, I fucking got this.

45:29.375 --> 45:31.083
[crowd cheering]

45:31.167 --> 45:33.333
[in Korean] Quiet, quiet! Be quiet!
Calm down!

45:34.833 --> 45:37.208
Hey. Let's get ready.

45:38.250 --> 45:39.417
One.

45:40.375 --> 45:41.708
Two.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.250
Three.

45:45.167 --> 45:46.667
-One shot!
-[crowd cheering]

46:12.542 --> 46:13.750
[grunting]

46:15.292 --> 46:16.833
[person cheers, claps]

46:16.917 --> 46:18.083
[cheering stops]

46:22.958 --> 46:24.708
[in English] Um…

46:25.208 --> 46:26.792
[paramedic] <i>Fifty-five year old male…</i>

46:26.875 --> 46:28.958
-[paramedic 2] Sir, sir! Can you hear me?
- <i>…No response.</i>

46:29.042 --> 46:31.167
[paramedic 3] There we go.
Sir, do you know where you are?

46:31.250 --> 46:32.625
He's breathing.

46:32.708 --> 46:33.708
He's breathing.

46:33.792 --> 46:35.667
[Yeon sighs] Thank God.

46:35.750 --> 46:38.333
Oh! Hi, my sweet little baby boo!

46:38.958 --> 46:40.625
Well played, Mr. Parker.

46:41.208 --> 46:42.625
Well played.

46:42.708 --> 46:44.000
[Marcus] Thank you. [chuckles]

46:44.083 --> 46:46.375
Uh, I need to find a bathroom.
I'll be back.

46:46.458 --> 46:47.958
[Ron] Me too.

46:49.417 --> 46:51.208
Okay, here's the way I look at it.

46:51.833 --> 46:56.583
I've got something you want,
and I really wanna fucking give it to you.

46:56.667 --> 46:59.875
So we just need to come up
with some kind of agreement.

46:59.958 --> 47:02.792
I told you. Ten grand.

47:02.875 --> 47:06.917
Actually, Warren,
I was thinking more like half.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.125
Half? Half of what?

47:09.208 --> 47:11.292
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

47:11.375 --> 47:12.958
Of whatever you've got on that plane.

47:15.667 --> 47:18.042
Yeah. That was a close call.

47:18.125 --> 47:21.375
I didn't exactly make it,
but thank God there were so many sinks.

47:22.750 --> 47:23.917
[Marcus] Reese?

47:26.500 --> 47:28.250
Holy shit, that is Reese.

47:29.125 --> 47:31.250
I don't know
what Jerome told you about me--

47:31.333 --> 47:33.000
-Jerome not work for me.
-[Reese] Okay, look.

47:33.083 --> 47:34.750
I know where your plane went down.

47:35.333 --> 47:36.667
Yeah, the location's a little hot,

47:36.750 --> 47:39.042
but I could take you there tomorrow
if you want.

47:39.125 --> 47:40.542
You can do that.

47:41.042 --> 47:43.250
Or you can just give me
the coordinates now.

47:43.333 --> 47:44.875
And give up all my leverage.

47:44.958 --> 47:46.667
Why the fuck would I do that?

47:46.750 --> 47:49.125
So I don't blow your damn brains out.

47:49.792 --> 47:51.958
What you gonna do?
Shoot me in the middle of the dance floor?

47:52.042 --> 47:53.375
Of course not.

47:53.458 --> 47:56.250
Take him outside and then shoot him.

47:58.458 --> 48:00.542
Come on. Let's take a walk.

48:02.208 --> 48:04.542
Reese! Reese!

48:06.750 --> 48:09.208
Tell your ding-dongs
to put their guns away, all right?

48:09.292 --> 48:11.500
You see this guy
coming over here right now?

48:11.583 --> 48:14.500
The one who looks like
he just had diarrhea?

48:14.583 --> 48:16.167
Mmm. No, not him. The one next to him.

48:16.250 --> 48:18.542
The big guy,
the scary-looking motherfucker.

48:18.625 --> 48:20.500
-He's with me.
-[Ron] Reese.

48:20.583 --> 48:22.000
-[chuckling] Hey, you two.
-Reese.

48:22.083 --> 48:24.000
Oh, Ron, am I glad to see you.

48:24.083 --> 48:26.208
Yeah, me too, Reese. We gotta talk.

48:26.708 --> 48:28.208
It's something important.

48:30.625 --> 48:31.625
Okay.

48:32.958 --> 48:36.042
[sniffles] Why don't you like me?

48:36.125 --> 48:37.875
[crying] I don't get it.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.583
[crying continues]

48:44.958 --> 48:46.958
-[Reese] Ron, Ron.
-[Ron speaks indistinctly]

48:47.042 --> 48:50.625
-Hey, um… [chuckles] …I'm-- I'm Marcus.
-[sniffles]

48:50.708 --> 48:54.292
Okay, come on, baby. Paint that ace!
Okay, come on! Let's paint that ace.

48:54.375 --> 48:56.750
-Paint that ace with a ten!
-Blackjack again.

48:56.833 --> 49:00.250
-Y'all see that? That's me all day.
-[floor boss] Excuse me, ma'am.

49:00.333 --> 49:03.000
-[Emily] Hey.
-I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

49:03.083 --> 49:04.333
Why?

49:04.417 --> 49:08.417
You are aware that in this casino
counting cards is strictly forbidden?

49:08.500 --> 49:10.125
Oh! Well, I'm not counting cards.

49:10.208 --> 49:11.625
See-- Let me tell you how to play.

49:11.708 --> 49:15.250
You just gotta keep track
of the face cards and the low cards. Boom.

49:15.333 --> 49:17.083
That is counting cards.

49:18.583 --> 49:19.583
It is?

49:19.667 --> 49:20.625
[sniffling]

49:20.708 --> 49:22.917
Get it together, man. What's the matter?

49:23.000 --> 49:24.625
[stammers] For the first time ever,

49:24.708 --> 49:27.000
I'm having to deal with
all these emotions.

49:27.083 --> 49:29.625
You know, uh, disappointment, insecurity…

49:29.708 --> 49:31.875
-Okay, now is not the time to--
-…inadequacy.

49:31.958 --> 49:35.458
How about anger? Huh?
You feeling some anger now? Fury?

49:35.542 --> 49:38.958
No. It's, uh--
It's like a pain and a sadness.

49:39.042 --> 49:41.667
I just wish you knew
I would do anything for you, Reese.

49:42.458 --> 49:44.708
-Anything?
-You name it. You name it.

49:44.792 --> 49:49.083
Okay, well, why don't you tell Warren here
how many people you've killed?

49:51.625 --> 49:52.625
Oh, I…

49:54.000 --> 49:57.208
Warren, hey, I am Ron.

49:58.292 --> 49:59.792
Yeah, nice to meet you guys.

49:59.875 --> 50:01.250
I can't do that because of the code.

50:01.333 --> 50:02.583
-We talked about it. I--
-Ron!

50:02.667 --> 50:04.542
Okay, 42 people. Forty-two.

50:06.875 --> 50:09.542
All legitimate targets though.
Hmm. Every one of them.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.458
[whispers] Hey, um…

50:15.833 --> 50:17.833
I think
we should get the fuck out of here.

50:17.917 --> 50:20.542
Um… I don't think
you're reading the room correctly.

50:20.625 --> 50:24.292
-[chuckles] We gonna get up out of here.
-That would be best.

50:24.375 --> 50:27.667
No, wait. A few iffys. You guys--
They wanna hear about the iffys?

50:29.292 --> 50:31.208
What can I say, Warren? I tried.

50:34.417 --> 50:35.792
Reese, what was that all about?

50:36.292 --> 50:37.333
[Reese] What was what about?

50:37.417 --> 50:39.292
You know what. The shit with those dudes.

50:39.375 --> 50:40.375
Who?

50:40.458 --> 50:43.542
Oh, those guys. Yeah, no, they're--
They're just new friends of mine.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.125
New friends who were very impressed
with you, Ron.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
As was I.

50:49.833 --> 50:51.667
-Really?
-[chuckling] Yeah, hey.

50:52.208 --> 50:54.958
Salaam and all that. Thanks again.

50:55.042 --> 50:56.250
I'll catch you guys later.

50:58.083 --> 51:00.583
Look, Ron. I know that's
your father-in-law and everything,

51:00.667 --> 51:02.875
but that guy is up to something.
I'm telling you.

51:02.958 --> 51:03.958
Reese?

51:04.792 --> 51:05.792
Come on.

51:05.960 --> 51:08.042
You were right. He didn't bite. [sighs]

51:08.125 --> 51:09.792
In fact, he was being a dick about it.

51:10.292 --> 51:12.000
Look, it's time to move to plan B.

51:13.208 --> 51:17.083
Yes, Jerome. I have a plan B.
Tell me you know how to scuba dive.

51:17.667 --> 51:18.875
Reese is a great dude.

51:18.958 --> 51:21.042
Look at me, no the fuck he's not.

51:21.125 --> 51:22.333
He's not even an okay dude.

51:22.417 --> 51:24.000
Did you just not see that?

51:25.167 --> 51:26.292
We connected, man.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.875
I think this might've been,
like, a real breakthrough.

51:28.958 --> 51:31.458
You know what? I may even
look into that crypto thing he's got.

51:31.542 --> 51:33.792
-What? You don't need to be participa--
-[Emily] Let me go!

51:33.875 --> 51:35.000
But I wasn't even cheating!

51:35.083 --> 51:36.833
-Wait, where's my money?
-Is that Emily?

51:36.917 --> 51:39.667
Where is my money?
I'm from Chicago. Let me down!

51:39.750 --> 51:42.042
Shit. Get your hands off my fucking wife!

51:45.833 --> 51:49.208
[Yeon] Again, thank you so much
for doing this.

51:49.292 --> 51:51.917
[Marcus] Ah, it's okay. It's okay.
We're-- We're almost to your room.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.458
[inhales sharply]
You wanna know something, Marcus?

51:54.542 --> 51:56.625
[laughs] I'm starting to like you.

51:57.125 --> 52:00.125
Okay, that's cool and everything, man.
And-And Yeon, look, I-I like you too.

52:00.208 --> 52:02.583
No, I'm not just drunk. I mean it.

52:03.208 --> 52:05.208
You're a fighter, like me.

52:05.292 --> 52:06.708
You think on your feet.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.625
Plus, you have great friends.

52:10.375 --> 52:11.500
Fucking love you, man.

52:12.292 --> 52:14.250
-[Ron] Oh!
-[Yeon] And in my opinion…

52:14.333 --> 52:16.083
-[Ron grunts] Okay.
-[breathes heavily]

52:16.167 --> 52:17.375
…you should get this job.

52:17.875 --> 52:19.333
Seriously?

52:20.042 --> 52:21.208
It's my honest opinion.

52:21.292 --> 52:23.125
[chuckles] That's great, man.

52:23.708 --> 52:26.167
Too bad my opinion doesn't matter.

52:27.583 --> 52:29.875
Wait, what? What are you
talking about? You're the VP.

52:29.958 --> 52:32.375
-You're in charge of this whole project.
-So what?

52:32.917 --> 52:34.542
She doesn't listen to me.

52:34.625 --> 52:38.125
Mrs. Kim doesn't care one bit
about my opinion.

52:38.208 --> 52:39.333
That's fucked up.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.042
-Ron, come on now.
-Sorry.

52:41.125 --> 52:42.833
No. No, he's right.

52:43.458 --> 52:44.917
That is fucked up.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
[scoffs] You wanna hear my opinion?

52:48.167 --> 52:50.792
-You wanna hear my opinion, Mrs. Kim? Kim.
-Okay, okay.

52:50.875 --> 52:56.000
My opinion is that you are a mean person.

52:57.458 --> 52:59.292
-Yeon, you know she's not--
-I'm gonna tell her that.

52:59.375 --> 53:02.167
Next time I talk to her. I don't even
care anymore, I'm just gonna say it.

53:02.250 --> 53:03.667
I'm gonna say it to her face.

53:04.167 --> 53:07.167
-That's right. I'm gonna say--
-[cell phone buzzing]

53:11.958 --> 53:12.958
[clears throat]

53:13.667 --> 53:14.667
Mrs. Kim.

53:15.375 --> 53:16.375
Yes.

53:17.167 --> 53:18.208
[in Korean] Yes.

53:18.292 --> 53:20.458
[in English]
No, no, no, no, no. No. That--

53:20.542 --> 53:21.583
That won't be a problem.

53:21.667 --> 53:23.875
No, no, of course. Of course. Thank you.

53:23.958 --> 53:24.958
I'm sorry.

53:25.792 --> 53:27.083
Thank you. Sorry.

53:28.125 --> 53:29.125
[cell phone clicks]

53:29.625 --> 53:33.167
Uh. Mrs. Kim just spoke to her architects.

53:33.250 --> 53:37.000
And, uh, she would like the roof
to be slate now.

53:37.917 --> 53:41.917
[chuckles] She want the roof to--
to be slate?

53:42.000 --> 53:43.167
Is that gonna be a problem?

53:43.917 --> 53:45.375
Pfft. What?

53:45.458 --> 53:48.083
Shit, man! Look,
we've never worked with slate before.

53:48.167 --> 53:49.708
So what? We'll figure it out.

53:49.792 --> 53:52.750
What you mean, "So what"?
Look, this isn't thermo PVC, okay?

53:52.833 --> 53:54.625
And you gotta take into account
all breakages

53:54.708 --> 53:57.500
and fucking finding, uh-- uh,
bonding agents, all that shit.

53:57.583 --> 54:00.375
Come on, man. You gotta relax,
everything's gonna be fine.

54:00.458 --> 54:02.083
What the hell do you mean,
"It'll be fine"?

54:02.167 --> 54:05.125
I don't want it to just be fine.
I want it to be perfect.

54:05.208 --> 54:08.333
If you try to get it perfect,
you're just gonna fuck it up, playboy.

54:08.417 --> 54:09.417
Exactly why I never try.

54:09.500 --> 54:12.417
Shut the fuck up.
Both of y'all, just-just shut up.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.750
Do me a favor, okay?

54:14.250 --> 54:17.708
Work out a new budget, add the slate
in there, and give it to me tonight.

54:17.792 --> 54:19.083
Whoa. Tonight?

54:19.167 --> 54:22.625
Yes. Tonight. Okay, I wanna read
all of it. No surprises, okay?

54:22.708 --> 54:24.625
-Marcus Parker?
-[Fred] <i>Okay.</i>

54:24.708 --> 54:25.875
<i>Just so you know,</i>

54:25.958 --> 54:28.833
when you get the handouts tomorrow,
skip over the last part.

54:28.917 --> 54:29.958
That's all fucked up now.

54:30.042 --> 54:31.875
What are you talking about?
I got it in my hand here.

54:31.958 --> 54:34.708
Oh, no, you don't. We're tracking
right here, it says it's still in Miami.

54:34.792 --> 54:35.792
What's this then?

54:37.750 --> 54:40.958
What the fuck.

54:41.042 --> 54:42.042
[Fred] <i>Boss?</i>

54:42.625 --> 54:44.208
-Cocaine.
-Hey.

54:44.292 --> 54:46.125
-Oh!
-Glad I caught you.

54:46.208 --> 54:48.667
Cau-Caught me doing-- What'd you say?

54:50.667 --> 54:55.292
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for getting me home last night.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
Oh.

54:58.958 --> 55:01.667
Last night. Man, come on.
That-That was nothing.

55:01.750 --> 55:04.250
-No-No big deal at all.
-No, no, no. It is a big deal.

55:04.958 --> 55:07.375
[stammers]
I shared some thoughts that were…

55:08.583 --> 55:09.500
out of line.

55:09.583 --> 55:11.375
Thoughts about my superior.

55:12.708 --> 55:14.708
Dude, I don't know
what you're talking about.

55:14.792 --> 55:16.875
I don't even remember
none of that shit, but--

55:16.958 --> 55:20.167
No, no, no.
It was totally unprofessional and, uh…

55:20.250 --> 55:23.417
In fact, I don't even know
why I said that.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.667
I don't know where it came from.
I didn't mean it.

55:25.750 --> 55:29.792
Look, man. I-I'm not no snitch, okay?
I ain't gonna tell on you. You good.

55:30.667 --> 55:31.792
-Really?
-Yeah.

55:31.875 --> 55:34.125
Great, because the last thing
I would ever want to do

55:34.208 --> 55:36.667
is put you in an embarrassing situation
where you had--

55:37.667 --> 55:41.250
Oh. I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm, like, totally crushing your package.

55:41.333 --> 55:43.333
You ain't crushing my package,
'cause that's not mine.

55:43.417 --> 55:46.708
-Whatever you're crushing, no, it's not--
-Sorry, man. Gotta re-scan that.

55:47.292 --> 55:49.167
-Re-scan what?
-Uh, your express pack.

55:49.250 --> 55:50.750
You know, the one you just signed for?

55:50.833 --> 55:52.375
-Oh. This?
-There it is.

55:54.250 --> 55:55.542
Oh. [chuckles]

55:55.625 --> 55:57.167
You know something, I forgot--

55:57.250 --> 56:00.250
'Cause I had to sign for this earlier
for somebody else. 'Cause this not mine.

56:00.333 --> 56:02.583
-Know what I mean?
-Wait. Are you not Marcus Parker?

56:02.667 --> 56:03.833
No. No, he is.

56:03.917 --> 56:06.542
I thought so. Well, all yours.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Thank you.

56:09.917 --> 56:11.167
[whispering] Motherfucker.

56:13.833 --> 56:15.250
Is-- Is everything okay?

56:15.333 --> 56:16.417
Mm-hmm.

56:16.500 --> 56:17.833
Cocaine!

56:18.375 --> 56:20.875
Your father sent me cocaine.

56:20.958 --> 56:24.417
Wow! This is way more than you've
ever smuggled in your ass, babe.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.708
-It's a lot of cocaine.
-There's like five pounds in there.

56:26.792 --> 56:27.792
-What?
-[Maurillio] Marcus,

56:27.875 --> 56:30.167
why did you sign
for five pounds of cocaine?

56:30.250 --> 56:32.167
Yeah, baby. Why did you do that?

56:32.250 --> 56:33.958
I didn't know it was cocaine
in the package.

56:34.042 --> 56:36.250
When you sign for something,
they don't tell you what's in there.

56:36.333 --> 56:40.000
Oh, God! That's like major trafficking.
Like-like international--

56:40.083 --> 56:41.250
[snorts]

56:42.292 --> 56:43.292
Hey!

56:43.875 --> 56:45.625
What the fuck are you do--

56:45.708 --> 56:47.958
I didn't bring this to you to snort it.

56:48.042 --> 56:50.583
It is cocaine, Marcus. What are we--
Are we not supposed to do it?

56:50.667 --> 56:52.417
No, motherfucker! No!

56:52.500 --> 56:53.792
-[snorts]
-What the fuck are--

56:53.875 --> 56:57.042
You just heard me say some shit to him.
Get rid of this shit right the fuck now.

56:57.125 --> 56:58.292
We got rid of a little bit.

56:58.375 --> 57:01.958
Yeah. And I think if we just keep plugging
away, it'll be gone before we know it.

57:02.042 --> 57:04.167
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?

57:04.250 --> 57:08.958
Oh, great! Come on, Marcus.
Now Kyla knows?

57:09.042 --> 57:11.417
It was supposed to be a surprise. What--

57:12.333 --> 57:13.750
Oh. [laughs]

57:14.333 --> 57:17.708
I'm sorry, Reese.
Did I-- Did I ruin your surprise?

57:18.208 --> 57:19.500
Wow!

57:19.583 --> 57:21.708
You wanna know who else was surprised?
Come here.

57:22.500 --> 57:23.542
Me, motherfucker!

57:23.625 --> 57:24.958
I was surprised to get a package,

57:25.042 --> 57:26.875
and I almost opened that shit
in front of Yeon!

57:26.958 --> 57:28.667
First off, you told me
to put it in your name.

57:28.750 --> 57:30.125
I know what I said. Shut the fuck up.

57:30.208 --> 57:32.583
-Okay?
-What? What? Marcus. Marcus!

57:32.667 --> 57:34.958
Baby, I am sorry, but I was fucking right!

57:35.042 --> 57:37.375
He almost blew the job for me,
and I want him out of here.

57:37.458 --> 57:40.583
Matter of fact,
this guy right here is a criminal.

57:40.667 --> 57:43.500
If you went to jail,
you must have really did some shit.

57:43.583 --> 57:46.875
And, man, don't you give me that
"innocent victim of the system" bullshit.

57:46.958 --> 57:50.167
-I am an innocent victim of the system--
-I am an innocent-- Shut the fuck up!

57:50.250 --> 57:52.708
Just admit it,
you were using me to smuggle drugs.

57:52.792 --> 57:55.125
Marcus, that's not drugs.

57:55.208 --> 57:56.917
Kiss my ass, okay?

57:57.000 --> 58:00.125
If it's not drugs,
then, Reese, what the fuck is it?

58:00.208 --> 58:02.000
Why does this coke not taste coke-y?

58:03.500 --> 58:05.042
Because it's your mom.

58:07.292 --> 58:08.542
Oh, my God!

58:09.250 --> 58:10.583
That's her?

58:10.667 --> 58:13.542
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
-Yes, Emily.

58:13.625 --> 58:16.000
Those are her mom's ashes.

58:16.083 --> 58:17.375
[Kyla] Oh, Mom!

58:17.458 --> 58:19.208
She died while he was in jail,

58:19.292 --> 58:21.625
and we didn't get a chance
to spread her ashes around.

58:21.708 --> 58:24.333
Again, hated her, a witch.

58:24.833 --> 58:27.833
But I had them sent here
so we could scatter them together.

58:28.417 --> 58:29.625
I just snorted your mom?

58:30.125 --> 58:31.125
I just did too.

58:32.417 --> 58:34.583
It's really kind of beautiful
if you think about it.

58:34.667 --> 58:39.292
Well, I realize now I should've
reminded you about it, but fuck, Marcus.

58:39.792 --> 58:43.167
I had no idea you'd rip it open
and start chopping her up into lines.

58:43.250 --> 58:44.833
-Hey, hey. Look, man.
-I mean--

58:44.917 --> 58:48.667
Now you can-- I did some fucked--
I said some mean--

58:48.750 --> 58:51.458
I said some really mean things,
but I'ma tell you what I didn't do.

58:51.542 --> 58:54.375
I did not chop those white-woman ashes up.

58:54.458 --> 58:56.750
-That is what they did. I did not do that.
-Look-- [scoffs]

58:56.833 --> 58:59.667
Marcus, I know you're all stressed out
before your million dollar meeting,

58:59.750 --> 59:03.500
but I was just trying
to do something special for my daughter.

59:04.250 --> 59:05.250
Now it's ruined.

59:06.375 --> 59:07.375
Look, Reese, I--

59:08.500 --> 59:11.500
I-I didn't know it was
a father-daughter moment, okay? I'm sorry.

59:12.125 --> 59:14.333
Yeah, well, hey,
it's a little late for sorry.

59:15.083 --> 59:19.667
And to think I came in here to tell you
all about this great day trip I booked.

59:19.750 --> 59:20.875
A day trip?

59:20.958 --> 59:22.167
Yeah, snorkeling.

59:23.125 --> 59:26.375
I found out about this secret spot
that's supposed to be amazing.

59:27.542 --> 59:30.458
Ah, never mind,
the vibe is too shitty now.

59:31.042 --> 59:32.708
No, hey!

59:32.792 --> 59:34.583
Reese, you stop that crazy talk, okay?

59:35.583 --> 59:36.917
Snorkeling is a great idea.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.417
-Right, Kyla?
-Yeah, Dad.

59:38.500 --> 59:39.458
-Really.
-Ah.

59:39.542 --> 59:41.333
Yeah. Right, Marcus?

59:42.250 --> 59:43.458
Right, Marcus?

59:43.542 --> 59:45.542
Right, Marcus?

59:46.583 --> 59:48.167
Right, Marcus?

59:49.917 --> 59:53.125
Aight, look, if y'all wanna go snorkeling,
I'm in. Shit.

59:53.208 --> 59:56.708
-Yay! Everyone's happy again!
-Fuck yeah! Let's do this!

59:57.542 --> 59:58.542
-Right.
-[chuckles]

59:58.625 --> 01:00:02.000
Oh, my God, Dad! Look, I brought Mom.

01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:06.333
I thought we could spread her when
we're done here. Or, you know, 99% of her.

01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:09.667
-That's great.
-[Emily] Wait. Reese, hold up.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.667
We're flying in there? In that?

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.083
-[Reese] Awesome, right?
-Reese, no, I can't fly nowhere.

01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:16.292
I got a big meeting tomorrow
I gotta prepare for.

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:19.625
Well then you should thank me because
we're gonna get there ten times faster.

01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:21.000
That is some great thinking, Reese.

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:23.208
No seats! It's so rustic!

01:00:23.292 --> 01:00:24.667
[Reese] Come on, Marcus.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.708
I got it all handled. There's even
a boat waiting for us and everything.

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:28.792
Right, Captain?

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.917
-[Kyla] I am so excited, Dad.
-[Reese chuckles]

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.208
You guys, it's gonna be so fun!

01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:35.917
[Reese] Oh, honey.
Just wait until you get in the water.

01:00:36.543 --> 01:00:37.917
[ship horn blows]

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
[siren wailing in distance]

01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:48.667
Reese, what the fuck is this?
This place sucks!

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:53.458
Think you gotta go out further. Yeah.
Oh, I think I see some dolphins.

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:55.625
-What?
-Yeah, yeah. Go!

01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:04.583
We're just a happy family snorkeling.
Nothing to see here.

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:11.375
[Reese grunts, pants]

01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:14.042
-Is this all of them?
-Nah, man. Me think there's one more.

01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:16.000
Hurry up, Jerome. Come on.

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:32.208
[baby Marcus crying]

01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:34.667
[Maurillio]
Okay, somebody's getting upset.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.125
Somebody's getting more upset, and…

01:01:37.875 --> 01:01:40.250
-Okay. Let's go wrap you.
-[crying continues]

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:43.583
[sighs, speaks in Spanish]

01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:45.500
[in English] I'm no killer.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.000
[in Spanish]

01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:56.708
[person, in English] Excuse me?

01:01:57.583 --> 01:02:00.542
I-- Hi, I-I don't mean
to be forward, I just--

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:03.708
I have to tell you
that I have never seen a man

01:02:03.792 --> 01:02:05.417
with a better touch
with his baby than you.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.292
Oh, eh. Thank you, <i>señora</i>.

01:02:07.917 --> 01:02:10.167
-It's Veronika.
-Ah. Thank you, Veronika.

01:02:10.667 --> 01:02:13.958
I am Maurillio.
But this Caucasian baby is not mine.

01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:16.208
Seriously?

01:02:16.292 --> 01:02:19.250
Oh, yes. I have no children,
uh, that I know of.

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:25.083
I am kidding. I am childless.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.000
-Can I ask you a question?
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:29.208 --> 01:02:30.667
Are you doing anything later?

01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:44.917
[groans] Oh, God,
that was fucking disgusting.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.125
Wait, what is that shit?

01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:49.083
You mean the jellyfish?

01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:50.875
I saw all too clearly what it was.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.375
For recreational waters,
these conditions are deplorable.

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:55.875
I'm not talking about that.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.917
Wha-What Reese got going on? Fuck this.

01:03:00.542 --> 01:03:02.625
We are definitely gonna need
tetanus shots.

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.125
This is disgusting.

01:03:04.208 --> 01:03:05.333
[moans]

01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:10.583
-[Marcus groans]
-[Reese] Hey. Sorry.

01:03:10.667 --> 01:03:12.292
I was just about to call you in.

01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:13.500
-[Marcus] Is that right?
-Yeah.

01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.083
Visibility is not so great today, huh?

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.167
-Reese, what are these bags?
-What bags?

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:21.042
"What bags"? You fucking with me--
I'm talking about these bags here.

01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:23.833
-Oh, yeah.
-Reese? Reese! Somebody's got eyes on us.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.292
[Reese] Ah, fuck!

01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:28.792
[Jerome] We gotta get moving, like, now!

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.708
Okay, kids. Time to pack up
and head out. Right now.

01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:37.375
Reese, seriously. What's in these bags?

01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:39.042
-Come on.
-What's with the crazy rush?

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:41.250
Oh, man. That's--
It's a really funny story.

01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:43.250
-[Kyla] Oh? Tell me!
-Oh, I will, baby.

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:45.125
But on the way back, okay? Come on.

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:46.375
-[Kyla] Okay.
-[Ron] Hey, uh,

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.000
don't we have to tie up the boat?

01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:49.625
No, Ron. It's okay, just leave it.

01:03:49.708 --> 01:03:51.375
All right, everybody in.

01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.917
We can catch that beautiful sunset, right?

01:03:54.417 --> 01:03:56.750
And dig into that fancy bottle of rum
you bought.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.583
[Kyla] Oh, that sounds good!

01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:03.042
[engine sputters]

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.292
Fuck!

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.875
[in Spanish] <i>Attention.
This is the National Cuban Police.</i>

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:07.958
[in English] Oh, no.

01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:09.875
[in Spanish]
<i>You have entered Cuban territory.</i>

01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:11.417
[in English] But who the hell are they?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.125
[Reese] Oh, yeah.
Must be the local game wardens,

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:17.583
and they-- they are really strict
about snorkeling in Cuba, so come on.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:20.667
Cuba. Hey! Fucker--
You brought us to Cuba?

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:21.792
Yeah, yeah. But it's okay.

01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:23.542
We just don't wanna deal with them.
Come on.

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:25.208
-Shit.
-[engine sputters]

01:04:25.292 --> 01:04:26.625
[Reese] Jerome, please!

01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:28.000
I'm trying!

01:04:29.083 --> 01:04:30.458
Jerome? Reese?

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.083
What?

01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:33.833
I do want to deal with them.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.417
That is the filthiest snorkeling site
I've ever seen.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.792
-No, you really don't wanna--
-[Ron] No, Reese.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:40.875
As a park ranger,

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:44.250
it's not the first time I've had to call
out the negligence of game wardens.

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:46.958
-Kyla? My credentials?
-Oh, got it. Got it, got it. Right here.

01:04:47.042 --> 01:04:49.500
-[engine sputtering]
-[Cuban police continue indistinctly]

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:54.458
Gentlemen!

01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:56.542
Over here!

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.917
Just gonna find out who's in charge.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.625
Whoever is, is about to get their ass--
Oh, shit!

01:05:07.292 --> 01:05:09.583
-Ron! You gotta get the fuck in here!
-[Reese] Come on!

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.542
Go! Go!

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:12.917
[Jerome] Get in! Get in!

01:05:13.792 --> 01:05:15.000
-[Ron grunts]
-[Kyla screams]

01:05:18.292 --> 01:05:20.500
-What is happening?
-Why are they shooting at us?

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.542
-What the fuck is going on?
-[shouts]

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.250
[Emily screams]

01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:26.833
Shit!

01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:28.958
-Can you take off already?
-[Jerome] I can't.

01:05:29.042 --> 01:05:31.250
-We're too fucking heavy.
-[Reese] What?

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:32.625
Toss something! Now!

01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:33.708
[Kyla] What the--

01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:34.958
[Reese grunts]

01:05:37.792 --> 01:05:39.000
[groans]

01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:48.458
I love you, Mom!

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:05.792
[sighs] And I came on this trip
with all of these stupid expectations.

01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:08.542
Like, I'm a single woman, right?
I'm available.

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:11.917
Oh, you are more than available.
You are ready to meet someone.

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:16.333
What was I thinking? The reality is,
I've barely left the resort all week.

01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:19.000
But then I saw you and--

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:21.542
The world of possibilities just opened up?

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:24.042
Yes! Exactly!

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:26.625
-[laughs] Would you get out of my brain?
-I don't want to.

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:28.208
[both laughing]

01:06:29.375 --> 01:06:33.375
You know, I heard that the casino in town
is supposed to be great.

01:06:34.083 --> 01:06:35.083
Coral Cay?

01:06:35.167 --> 01:06:38.667
Oh, yes. It's supposed to be magnificent.

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.958
Well, then I guess there's just
one thing left to ask.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.333
How much do you charge?

01:06:50.167 --> 01:06:52.500
I mean for the whole night.
'Cause if I'm going, I wanna go deep.

01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:56.000
Quick question.
Uh, what exactly are you looking for?

01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:57.875
Hmm? Someone to watch my baby.

01:06:58.792 --> 01:07:00.208
-Baby?
-Yeah!

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:02.167
-Hi, little bubs.
-Oh, look at that baby.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:03.375
[Maurillio] Oh.

01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:06.042
[gasps] Isn't he so cute?

01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:08.125
-[Maurillio chuckles]
-[mumbles]

01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:14.542
Oh. I-I didn't even ask.

01:07:15.042 --> 01:07:16.083
How was the snorkeling?

01:07:16.167 --> 01:07:17.917
It was just okay.

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.292
Fuck that! See what's in there--

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:23.042
Hey, wait. What are you doing?
Marcus, no, no, no.

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:26.000
-[Marcus] What's in this bag, right--
-Hey, no. Do not open that--

01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:29.542
Reese?

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:32.000
Whose money is this, huh?

01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:33.250
Whose money is this?

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:34.458
[screams]

01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:37.583
[engine sputters]

01:07:38.167 --> 01:07:40.708
Um. Shit, shit.
I think we got a problem, brother.

01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:43.292
-They must've hit a fuel line.
-The fuel line?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.250
[sighs]

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.042
Don't tell me that's Lower St. James.

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:49.000
[sighs] That's Lower St. James.

01:07:57.208 --> 01:08:00.042
[airplane engine sputtering]

01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:01.542
Okay, we cannot land there.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:02.625
[Jerome] No shit!

01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:05.583
[Reese] The hotel's just over that bridge.
Turn, turn, turn.

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:06.667
[Jerome] I got it!

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:09.375
All right. Can you make it
to the other side of the island?

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:10.667
Yeah, man. Definitely.

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:15.500
-[crashes]
-[engine stops]

01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:18.375
[crashing]

01:08:18.458 --> 01:08:19.917
[Warren] Hold on right there.

01:08:23.458 --> 01:08:25.125
Now what the fuck was that?

01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:27.667
I could've sworn that was Jerome's plane.

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:30.708
Jerome?

01:08:35.583 --> 01:08:36.833
[Marcus coughs]

01:08:36.918 --> 01:08:37.710
[Emily coughs]

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:40.792
[Kyla coughs]

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:43.750
[pants] That was not a fun crash.

01:08:43.833 --> 01:08:45.833
-[Emily grunts, pants]
-[Reese grunts]

01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:47.958
Is everybody okay?

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:49.042
I'm good. Everybody else?

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.500
-[Kyla] Yeah.
-[Reese] All good.

01:08:50.583 --> 01:08:52.417
-[Kyla] God, I keep--
-[Reese] Except for Jerome.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.292
Oh, God, no. Did he not make it?

01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:57.792
Oh, he did. And he just fucked me
out of a million bucks.

01:08:57.875 --> 01:08:58.958
What a dick.

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.708
I thought we were friends!

01:09:02.583 --> 01:09:04.875
Okay, guys. That was a goddamn commotion.

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:08.208
So, yeah, we should--
We should get all our stuff and go.

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:10.375
Shit!

01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:12.250
I have no bars. Fuck!

01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:14.000
-Baby.
-Hey, where you going?

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:16.042
-[Emily] Baby, wait. What is--
-[Marcus] Shit.

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:17.667
[Reese] Marcus, what are you doing?

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:20.625
Something I should've did a long time ago
is to call the cops on your ass.

01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:24.542
-Shit. I can't get a signal.
-No, no. No cops. Will you listen to me?

01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:25.833
We need to get out of here.

01:09:25.917 --> 01:09:28.917
Look, I'm not fucking moving, okay?
Until you tell us the truth, okay?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.417
Look, what is all this shit?

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.417
Dad, there's gotta be, like, a perfectly
innocent explanation for all this, right?

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:36.250
Okay, fine. All right, look.

01:09:36.333 --> 01:09:39.583
I'm gonna give you the God's honest.
All my cards, plunk, on the table.

01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:42.500
When I heard
that I was gonna get out of prison,

01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:44.708
was my first thought to come see you?

01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:48.125
To belatedly celebrate
my beautiful daughter's nuptials?

01:09:48.208 --> 01:09:50.708
-Yes. Yes, it was.
-[chuckles] See?

01:09:51.208 --> 01:09:52.750
-Thank you.
-[Reese chuckles]

01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:54.875
You know, me being away
and out of your life.

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:57.958
I just thought that there's no way
I could ever make it up to you.

01:09:58.042 --> 01:10:02.208
But when I told the other guys in prison
that I was headed for the Caribbean,

01:10:02.292 --> 01:10:05.417
well, this very nice dude
named Frankie in D-block,

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:09.625
he told me about a plane that went down
in the waters off Cuba.

01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:13.292
-[Kyla] Hmm.
-A plane containing five million dollars.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.708
And then I thought, boom!

01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:18.083
That's my big wedding present to you.

01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:19.333
Minus my cut, of course.

01:10:19.417 --> 01:10:20.792
That's so sweet.

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:22.292
Kyla!

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:25.042
What? He's being thoughtful.

01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:28.458
Thoughtful?
Whose plane and whose money is this?

01:10:28.542 --> 01:10:30.958
-Is that really important right now?
-It actually kind of is.

01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:34.083
Reese, whose fucking money is it? Huh?

01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:36.667
A drug dealer's. That-- that guy, Warren.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:38.375
Warren, Warren, Warren.

01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:40.750
From the casino?

01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:42.458
[Reese] Yeah, can we get moving?

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:45.333
Because that was a super loud crash.

01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:48.708
And trust me, Warren's gonna eventually
find out where we are.

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:49.917
-Wait, what?
-What?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.333
Yes. Come on, can we just get the money
out of the plane before he--

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.875
[screams] Oh, my God.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:07.250
[Reese] Aw, I had it.
I had it right in my hands.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.708
-[Warren] Over there!
-Oh, fuck.

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:13.292
It's Reese.

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:15.333
I fucking knew it.

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:17.417
-[Marcus scream]
-[Emily] Shit! [screams]

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.375
[all scream]

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:19.583
-Go, go.
-Let's get out of here.

01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:20.792
-Cut them off!
-[shooter] Okay!

01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:22.917
Come on… We're on the move!

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.417
-[Ron] Go!
-[Kyla screams]

01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:27.708
[Emily] Go! Keep going!

01:11:27.792 --> 01:11:29.250
-[Ron] Go!
-[Kyla screams]

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.583
[Warren] Get them!

01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:34.667
[Marcus] Oh!

01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:38.458
[pants] Okay, the body's reaction
to gunfire is a surge of adrenaline.

01:11:38.542 --> 01:11:39.542
It's good. Harness it.

01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:41.875
Just don't let it overwhelm you,
you might give in to panic.

01:11:41.958 --> 01:11:44.750
[Marcus] Panic has already happened.
What if I've already given in to panic?

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.875
[cell phone rings]

01:11:46.958 --> 01:11:48.833
Zeke! Thank God! Zeke, listen to me!

01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:50.583
-Okay, so the slate's in the budget.
- <i>Listen!</i>

01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:53.000
-But there's one little surprise.
- <i>Damn it! Shit, motherfucker!</i>

01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:55.917
-Shut the fuck up!
- <i>Now this is probably gonna freak you out,</i>

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.375
-but I decided to change…
- <i>Zeke just--</i>

01:11:57.458 --> 01:11:58.708
-…the font in one section.
- <i>Please--</i>

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:01.708
- <i>I tried Helvetica, Times New Roman--</i>
-Shit! Listen! Motherfucker, shut up!

01:12:01.792 --> 01:12:03.500
-You don't understand!
- <i>No, no. Trust me.</i>

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:05.292
-It looks better bigger.
-[Marcus screams]

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:07.167
I don't give a fuck
about that shit right now!

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.500
<i>…trying to fucking kill me--</i>

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:13.667
I lost him! Shit!

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.917
So, how'd he take it?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.583
Hmm. Better than I thought.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.333
[Reese] Come on!

01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:20.583
[Emily screams]

01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:23.667
[Reese] Come on!

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:24.792
[Kyla panting]

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:27.625
[all panting]

01:12:32.333 --> 01:12:34.458
-[Marcus panting]
-[Emily] Come on, baby. Hurry up! Come on.

01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:35.708
-Yo! Yo.
-[Emily] Wait, what?

01:12:36.792 --> 01:12:38.792
-[whispers] Go, go, go, go.
-[Emily pants]

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:39.875
[Kyla] Go.

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.333
[whispers] Get in there. Get--

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:48.208
-[Reese stammers]
-Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:58.958
[car engine stops]

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.042
Now where the fuck did they go?

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:39.250
-[cell phone chimes]
-[automated voice] <i>You are ovulating.</i>

01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:48.167
[babies crying]

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.792
[Maurillio panting]

01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:52.083
[groaning]

01:13:53.625 --> 01:13:54.750
[grunts]

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.417
[in Spanish]

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.375
-[knocking]
-[sighs]

01:14:06.292 --> 01:14:08.167
[in English] Oh. Hey, Yeon. Come on in.

01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:09.458
Thanks. Uh…

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:13.333
I just wanted to check in with Mr. Parker
to see if he's, uh, okay with--

01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:18.125
Wait. Why are there two babies here?

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:20.667
Yes. I am asking myself
that very question.

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.750
Okay, uh.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:24.083
Anyway, I just wanted to check in
with Mr. Parker

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:27.042
to see if he's feeling good
about the presentation tomorrow.

01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:29.583
Because he seemed
a little stressed this morning.

01:14:29.667 --> 01:14:32.250
Oh. Well he's still
on his snorkeling trip.

01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:35.500
-Without me.
-He went on a snorkeling trip?

01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:37.250
Mm-hmm. Without me.

01:14:37.333 --> 01:14:38.333
Huh.

01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:41.750
Well, then I guess
he must have everything under control.

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:43.500
[babies crying]

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.417
I also have everything under control.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.250
[crying continues]

01:14:49.917 --> 01:14:51.708
[Reese] Look, Warren. I get it. I get it.

01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:54.250
You really want some answers here,
but it's getting late.

01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:56.667
So I was thinking we just pick this up
in the morning.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:58.042
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.208
You're not so tough, when your muscle
have an Uzi pointed at him. Eh?

01:15:05.917 --> 01:15:07.667
-Muscle?
-Kyla,

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.625
tell your dad to stop playing around.

01:15:09.708 --> 01:15:13.125
Dad. Why don't you honestly
just tell him what happened?

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.458
Yeah.

01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:17.083
Yeah, Reese. Tell me.

01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:21.000
Tell me where the fuck my money is!

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.542
Warren, I-I am out of moves here, okay?

01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:27.167
I'm gonna give you the God's honest.
All my cards, plunk, on the table.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.333
-[Warren] Mm-hmm.
-Oh, not this.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.917
Did I intend to take your money?

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:33.625
Yes.

01:15:34.292 --> 01:15:37.958
But then the Cubans showed up
and started shooting up our plane.

01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:39.042
So, I--

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:42.000
I never got to it.

01:15:43.042 --> 01:15:44.667
Your money is still down there.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.833
Under the water, where it's always been.

01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:50.375
So how about if I just give you
the coordinates, all right?

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:54.667
And then you guys can-- can go get it,
then we'll just-- We'll call it a day.

01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:03.875
Yeah, okay. Look, here.
I'm gonna write it down.

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:11.875
Okay?

01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:16.083
Yeah, well…

01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.792
-See? He's so smart.
-[whispers] Oh, God.

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:21.917
[Reese grunts]

01:16:22.492 --> 01:16:23.875
[ship horn blows]

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.625
[inhales sharply]
You know something, right now…

01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:34.917
is about when I'd be running through
my presentation for the last time.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.917
Then I'd call Zeke up, you know,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.417
yell at him to get the blood pumping,
and then I'd put my suit on and--

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.583
[chuckles]

01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:43.750
Make sure everything is right,
look through the papers,

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.333
make sure I got everything together…

01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:48.083
And then I'd go in the bathroom
and look right in the mirror.

01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:50.375
And I'd tell myself,

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:52.708
"You got this, playboy.

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.667
You fucking got this."

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:57.083
[scoffs, sighs]

01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:59.750
-[Emily] Hmm.
-But instead…

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.250
I'm in a fucking box.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.333
So thank you, Reese. Thank you so much.

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:09.458
You're welcome.

01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:12.292
Really, Reese?

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:14.417
Well, hey.
I bought us a little time, didn't I?

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.625
Look, if they find the plane, right?

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:19.792
And see no money's in there, what the fuck
you think is gonna happen, huh?

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:22.208
Well, Marcus.
I haven't figured that part out yet.

01:17:22.292 --> 01:17:23.875
-God.
-You haven't figured that part out?

01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:27.125
Reese hasn't figured that part out yet.
Wow.

01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:30.042
I mean, it feels like you
just know all types of shit.

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:33.625
But you-- But you haven't figured
that part out yet? Great job.

01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:35.417
Marcus, I'm not sure
if you're being sarcastic,

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.375
but I don't think there's
any reason to make my dad

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:39.542
out to be the bad guy here.

01:17:41.292 --> 01:17:42.417
But he is the bad guy.

01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:46.042
What did you just say?

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:49.083
Kyla, Marcus is right.
Reese is the bad guy here.

01:17:50.125 --> 01:17:53.375
Ever since he showed up, he turned
this relaxing family vacation into chaos.

01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:56.167
Total chaos. Who does that? [huffs]

01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.500
-Kyla.
-Yeah?

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.583
Kyla, there's something
I need to say to you, and--

01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:03.958
It is not gonna be easy to hear.

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:06.917
-But I'm gonna say it anyway.
-Okay.

01:18:07.542 --> 01:18:09.292
You know how everybody likes me?

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.208
Everyone on planet Earth.

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:16.167
Everybody does. Except for your father.

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.708
[scoffs]

01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:18.792
What?

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.125
-That's impossible.
-That's not all.

01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:25.500
You know how I like everyone?

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:27.625
Everyone you've ever met.

01:18:30.917 --> 01:18:34.583
There is a small piece of me… [sighs]

01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:38.250
-…that doesn't like him. I said it.
-[gasps] Ron!

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.125
Well, I guess that evens things out then.

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:43.083
What the hell's your problem, Reese?

01:18:43.167 --> 01:18:45.167
It's like everything out of your mouth's
an insult to me.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:48.667
-Like you're in some contest with me.
-Uh. It's hardly a contest.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.292
-Guys, you don't--
-Wanna know what I think?

01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:52.833
You're the one who feels inadequate.
I think you feel threatened by me.

01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:54.458
-Ron!
-What are you now, a therapist?

01:18:54.542 --> 01:18:55.500
This is not the moment

01:18:55.583 --> 01:18:56.875
-to have this conversation--
-The only

01:18:56.958 --> 01:19:00.583
time you were even remotely nice to me
was when you were using me at the casino.

01:19:00.667 --> 01:19:02.542
-'Cause you needed me to be your muscle.
-Fuck.

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:04.250
Hey. You should be flattered.

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:07.250
At least it's a step up
from being a fucking park ranger.

01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:10.417
Fuck you! How dare you
belittle that hallowed position!

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.208
Take it back, right now!

01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:14.042
-Take what back?
-Take it back, or there's gonna be

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.833
-some fucking consequences--
-Stop!

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:20.250
Both of you! Stop!

01:19:21.708 --> 01:19:25.708
We are family whether you like it or not,
you assholes.

01:19:25.792 --> 01:19:27.500
We are going to get out of here.

01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:30.542
And tomorrow we're gonna be sitting
on the beach,

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:33.417
sipping cocktails, having a great time.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.542
So sit the fuck down!

01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:40.417
And remember, everything is gonna be okay.

01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:43.042
[Marcus] What the fuck was that?

01:19:45.667 --> 01:19:46.750
-Oh, my God!
-[Reese] Uh--

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.542
We're moving!

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:50.792
[Kyla, Emily clamoring]

01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.833
[muffled shouting]

01:19:54.417 --> 01:19:56.833
All right, what's the word?

01:19:57.417 --> 01:20:00.917
It's definitely our plane.
It's right where the guy said it would be.

01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:04.125
<i>We're diving down now to get the money.</i>

01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:07.667
All right. We're done with them.

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:09.750

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.125

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.583
[Kyla screams] Are you okay?

01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:19.583
[Reese] What the--

01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:23.333
-[Kyla] They dropped us in the ocean?
-[Reese] Don't worry. Don't worry.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.667
[muffled shouting]

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:30.542
-[Marcus] Why's this thing moving?
-[Emily] What's happening, baby?

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.875
-It's filling up with water. We sinking?
-[Reese] It's all right.

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.125
We're sinking!

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:35.875
[Kyla] It's coming in fast.

01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:39.500
Relax, relax. We're not sinking, okay?
These things can float for days.

01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:40.833
How the fuck do you know that?

01:20:40.917 --> 01:20:42.458
Imports, exports, remember?

01:20:42.958 --> 01:20:45.667
I'm telling ya,
as long as we're floating, we're fine.

01:20:56.333 --> 01:20:57.708
-[screams]
-Damn it!

01:20:57.792 --> 01:21:00.458
-[Reese grunts] All right. Help!
-[Kyla] Let us out right now! Help!

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:02.708
I thought you said these things
don't sink, Reese!

01:21:02.792 --> 01:21:04.125
-[Kyla] Hey!
-Hey! Hey!

01:21:04.208 --> 01:21:05.250
-[pounding]
-[muffled shouting]

01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:07.625
[Marcus] Help us! Get us out of here!

01:21:08.292 --> 01:21:09.250
[Kyla] My God!

01:21:09.958 --> 01:21:13.292
-[Emily] Help! Help! Help us!
-[Reese] You hear us?

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:14.875
Ron! You gotta help us, man!

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.125
-Tell us what to do!
-[Ron] One thing left to do.

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:19.417
-[Kyla] Goddamn it! Help!
-[Emily] Get us out of here!

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.375
That's what you're gonna do
right the fuck now?

01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:24.667
-[Reese] Let us out!
-Old park ranger trick.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.208
Used to teach it to all the kids.

01:21:26.292 --> 01:21:27.875
-Help!
-You taught the kids to smoke weed?

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:30.083
[Ron]
No, I didn't teach them to smoke weed.

01:21:30.167 --> 01:21:32.042
I taught them
if you're ever stuck in a cave,

01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:36.375
find any incendiary material, light it,
and let the smoke lead you out.

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.458
-[Emily screams]
-[Kyla] Oh, my God!

01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:41.167
'Cause it always finds a way out.

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:42.792
[Emily cries] Please!

01:21:45.208 --> 01:21:48.208
There. The weak point. It's right there.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.917
-Get ready.
-To do what?

01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:56.375
Just float.

01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:58.958

-Come on, baby!

01:22:21.042 --> 01:22:23.167
Something supposed to happen? Because--

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:26.583
Yes, it was.
And I don't understand why it didn't.

01:22:26.667 --> 01:22:28.833
That's more than enough force
to breach corroded steel.

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:30.833
Here comes another flood of bullshit.

01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:34.875
It's not bullshit, Reese.
It's basic physics.

01:22:34.958 --> 01:22:38.000
The pressure differential in here
is much more--

Yeah, Ron. Now can you hot-wire
one of these cars?

01:27:33.583 --> 01:27:35.125
Raise your fucking hands.

01:27:36.667 --> 01:27:40.083
Oh, God. This is bad.
Kyla, this is really, really bad.

01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:41.167
Hold on. Hold on.

01:27:41.667 --> 01:27:44.542
Ron has, like, a really good touch
with drug dealers.

01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:46.542
Hands up higher, you pussy.

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:47.667
-Kyla.
-[pants] What?

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:48.875
Drug dealers!

01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:51.208
-Oh, my God. This is it. Come with me.
-Where are you--

01:27:56.708 --> 01:27:59.292
-Maurillio!
-Maurillio! Maurillio!

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:01.083
-[babies crying]
-[Kyla] Maurillio!

01:28:01.167 --> 01:28:02.583
[cooing]

01:28:02.667 --> 01:28:04.875
-Where is he? Fuck! Is he here?
-[Emily] Check upstairs--

01:28:04.958 --> 01:28:07.167
-In here.
-Oh, my God. Come on. Okay.

01:28:07.667 --> 01:28:09.292
[panting]

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:13.542
-Why are there two babies in here?
-Because I am very clearly not a killer.

01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:15.083
No, no, no. But you are.

01:28:15.167 --> 01:28:18.792
You're Novar. Chencho Novar!

01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:22.667
Wait. What?

01:28:22.835 --> 01:28:25.333
You have one last chance.

01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:27.042
Reese,

01:28:27.708 --> 01:28:30.500
where is my money?

01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:34.083
Pfft. You mean it wasn't on the plane?

01:28:34.167 --> 01:28:37.458
You know, salt water is pretty corrosive,
so maybe--

01:28:37.542 --> 01:28:38.750
Okay, it's torched.

01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:40.708
All of it, torched.

01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:44.792
Believe me, I am more bummed
about this than you are.

01:28:45.583 --> 01:28:46.750
You sure are.

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:49.833
You sure fucking are.

01:28:49.917 --> 01:28:50.917
[Maurillio] Gentlemen.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.500
May I ask you to put your guns down?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.417
[mouthing] What are you doing?

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.458
Who the fuck are you?

01:29:02.542 --> 01:29:03.583
-[muttering]
-Go!

01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:06.875
You know my name.

01:29:08.833 --> 01:29:10.625
Perhaps all too well.

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:14.833
For I am Novar.

01:29:17.542 --> 01:29:18.625
Chencho Novar.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.708
You're not no fucking Novar.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.417
But I am.

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:27.833
You see…

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:31.375
nobody knows what I look like
for a reason.

01:29:33.292 --> 01:29:36.458
Unlike you, who is known by so many,

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.500
Warren.

01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:40.833
How you know my fucking name, eh?

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.167
How do I know his name?

01:29:45.167 --> 01:29:46.458
You may run this island.

01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:49.542
You may know everything
that goes on here. But me?

01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:52.292
I know everything that goes on everywhere.

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:57.000
So if I were you,
I would let my friends go.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.500
Friends?

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:02.250
-They're with you?
-Oh. Yeah.

01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:03.500
Hey, Novar.

01:30:04.792 --> 01:30:05.958
We're totally with him.

01:30:07.167 --> 01:30:08.917
Because if you do not release them,

01:30:09.417 --> 01:30:14.083
well, the consequences
will be most unpleasant.

01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:18.375
Violence…

01:30:19.792 --> 01:30:21.125
she is my sweet lover.

01:30:21.208 --> 01:30:23.500
Uh. Too-- too much Maurillio.
Too-- too much.

01:30:23.583 --> 01:30:25.167
I know, he needs to pull back.

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:27.833
Perhaps you've seen some
of my cruel handiwork in Cartagena?

01:30:28.333 --> 01:30:29.375
Hmm?

01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:31.792
The bag of heads in Caracas?

01:30:32.292 --> 01:30:35.042
No, you back there
with the BO I can smell from here?

01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:39.625
Well, they made the most impressive
documentary about it.

01:30:40.792 --> 01:30:41.917
You should check it out.

01:30:43.083 --> 01:30:45.375
But that? That will be nothing, Warren.

01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:47.250
If you do not heed my warning,

01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:52.917
this quaint island of yours
will endure horrors you can't imagine.

01:30:53.417 --> 01:30:56.667
The streets bathed in crimson.

01:30:56.750 --> 01:31:01.208
Severed heads affixed upon
all manner of public signage.

01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:04.792
The entrails of your beloved ones
strewn across the room--

01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:05.875
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chencho?

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:10.125
Well, you get the point.

01:31:15.833 --> 01:31:18.167
All right. Fine.

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:21.250
These two can go.

01:31:22.542 --> 01:31:24.500
[whispering] You smart fucking lady.

01:31:24.583 --> 01:31:27.083
Honestly, me don't know
who the fuck them is anyway.

01:31:27.667 --> 01:31:29.833
And I definitely
don't give a fuck who you is.

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:31.917
But Reese.

01:31:32.875 --> 01:31:35.000
Reese, I want five million for him.

01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.333
Or him dead.

01:31:37.667 --> 01:31:38.875
Five million dollars?

01:31:39.417 --> 01:31:41.458
Pfft. No problem.

01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:46.375
[inhales deeply]
Does anybody have five million dollars?

01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:50.583
I do.

01:31:50.667 --> 01:31:51.833
[Marcus] What?

01:31:51.917 --> 01:31:53.083
No. Seriously, I do.

01:31:54.917 --> 01:31:56.208
I believe you have my phone.

01:31:56.292 --> 01:31:58.000
What you want your phone for?

01:31:58.083 --> 01:32:00.833
So I can wire you the money.
You-- I mean, you can watch.

01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:13.958
What-- What is he doing? What's Ron doing?

01:32:14.042 --> 01:32:15.333
I don't know.

01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:21.875
-What kind of bullshit is he pulling?
-I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

01:32:23.708 --> 01:32:25.583
-[cell phone chimes]
-Yeah.

01:32:30.208 --> 01:32:34.375
-All right. We're good here, guys.
-[Warren's guy] Yep, move on.

01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:35.458
-Okay.
-Oh, my God!

01:32:35.542 --> 01:32:36.375
[Emily] What!

01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:37.458
What?

01:32:39.542 --> 01:32:41.792
-Ron, what the fuck did you do?
-[Kyla squeals]

01:32:41.875 --> 01:32:43.792
You're a genius! [squeals]

01:32:43.875 --> 01:32:46.375
Baby! I'm so proud of you!

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.292
-Ron, what the fuck was that?
-I just paid the man.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:51.917
With what?
Where'd you get five million dollars from?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.292
Check this out.

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:57.958
What the hell is Secure Commerce
for Online Markets?

01:32:59.583 --> 01:33:00.708
SCOM-coin!

01:33:01.292 --> 01:33:02.417
Wait, wait, wait.

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.208
-That crypto thing? That was real?
-[Ron] Yeah.

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:05.542
Took Reese up on his hot tip.

01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:08.542
Yesterday morning I invested 30K
and it 200x-ed by lunch.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:09.625
Oh, my God.

01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:11.125
-You're such a genius.
-Whoa, whoa.

01:33:11.208 --> 01:33:14.417
You-you paid five million bucks for me?

01:33:15.208 --> 01:33:16.583
To save my life?

01:33:16.667 --> 01:33:18.875
[sighs] What can I say? Kyla was right.

01:33:20.083 --> 01:33:21.083
We are family.

01:33:23.083 --> 01:33:24.208
Seriously, son.

01:33:27.292 --> 01:33:28.292
Salaam.

01:33:28.875 --> 01:33:31.250
[whirring]

01:33:34.708 --> 01:33:35.917
-Baby. Go!
-Shit! I gotta--

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.542
-Go!
-Go!

01:33:38.792 --> 01:33:40.583
Mrs. Kim! Mrs. Kim! Wait.

01:33:40.667 --> 01:33:43.458
Hey, hey, hey! You stop that!
You stop the helicopter!

01:33:43.542 --> 01:33:45.125
[panting] Cut it off!

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:46.750
Okay, Mrs. Kim.

01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:50.125
-[pants] I really need you to hear me out.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:52.958
I have another meeting.
Now if you will excuse me.

01:33:53.042 --> 01:33:55.625
Okay, no! No! No.

01:33:56.125 --> 01:33:59.917
I-I don't-- I don't mean to yell
but I-I can't excuse you.

01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:04.542
Understand this, me and my friends
have been through hell to get here.

01:34:04.625 --> 01:34:05.917
Hell!

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.208
Okay? So this has to happen.

01:34:08.292 --> 01:34:11.792
And if I can be honest with you,
I don't give a fuck no more. All right?

01:34:12.583 --> 01:34:14.667
So if you can, just stand there in your--

01:34:15.167 --> 01:34:16.625
in your perfect outfit

01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:21.875
and your very comfortable heels
and beautiful steamed blouse.

01:34:22.875 --> 01:34:25.125
And just hear me out. Please!

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.292
Please. I got something I gotta say.

01:34:28.917 --> 01:34:29.917
Which is?

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:34.250
Pretend like I have a clicker
'cause I had a whole slideshow.

01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:40.042
[blows] Parker Construction
was founded in 2007,

01:34:41.292 --> 01:34:42.750
-by a kid--
-Stop!

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Mr. Parker.

01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:49.792
In the silence
of that empty conference room,

01:34:50.417 --> 01:34:52.500
I was able to digest your written budget,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.250
which was quite thorough.

01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:58.167
But I didn't become head of my company
by just analyzing numbers.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I did it by listening to my gut,
Mr. Parker.

01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:04.417
Do you know what my gut
is telling me right now?

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.667
That-that, um--

01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:08.750
That your gut likes--
likes Parker Construct--

01:35:08.833 --> 01:35:09.833
It's telling me…

01:35:10.375 --> 01:35:12.750
I flew you out here,
put you up for a week,

01:35:12.833 --> 01:35:15.208
had my staff tend to your every need,

01:35:15.292 --> 01:35:18.792
and yet you still left me sitting there
for 12 full minutes.

01:35:19.292 --> 01:35:21.792
Now I don't care
if you were held at gunpoint, or if--

01:35:21.875 --> 01:35:24.708
Okay, I'm glad you brought that up
'cause that actually just happened

01:35:24.792 --> 01:35:26.875
-two minutes ago right over there--
-The point…

01:35:26.958 --> 01:35:28.375
is that my gut is never wrong.

01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:34.375
So, I'm quite certain
you are not the man for this job.

01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:40.833
I have a different opinion.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:46.625
What did you just say?

01:35:48.833 --> 01:35:50.458
I have a different opinion.

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.250
Oh.

01:35:58.042 --> 01:36:00.708
Baby. Okay, so…

01:36:03.125 --> 01:36:05.167
-He got the job.
-I got the fucking job.

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:07.333
-[Emily] You got the job?
-I got the fucking job.

01:36:07.417 --> 01:36:08.875
-[Emily] Yes! Baby!
-Fuck yeah, Marcus!

01:36:08.958 --> 01:36:10.750
-[Maurillio] Oh! [laughs]
-[Kyla] Yes!

01:36:10.833 --> 01:36:12.167
We knew you could do it!

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:14.333
I didn't, but yes!

01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:17.542
[sighs] Baby, I am just so proud of you!

01:36:17.625 --> 01:36:19.125
You know something? Honestly,

01:36:19.792 --> 01:36:21.875
if it wasn't for Yeon,
I wouldn't have the job.

01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:24.250
He-- He really vouched for me, you know?

01:36:24.833 --> 01:36:26.958
[sighs] Yeon. Thank you, brother.

01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:31.833
Yeah. Turns out my opinion
actually does matter.

01:36:32.833 --> 01:36:35.000
This calls for a celebration. Right?

01:36:35.083 --> 01:36:38.375
And when we get some drinks, I'm going
to be the first one to raise my glass to--

01:36:38.458 --> 01:36:41.792
Oh, my God! The babies.

01:36:48.875 --> 01:36:50.750
[Ron] I fucking love this little guy.

01:36:50.833 --> 01:36:52.667
-[Kyla chuckles]
-He's a little genius.

01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:55.292
You guys have any second thoughts?

01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:56.958
-I'm good, you good?
-I'm Gucci.

01:36:57.042 --> 01:36:59.167
-Oh, no, we good.
-We're great, thank you though.

01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:02.458
Hey, hey. But little Marcus
can come visit us anytime he wants to.

01:37:02.542 --> 01:37:03.542
Absolutely. I mean,

01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:06.333
we may even know of a hotel
where you guys can stay at in Chicago.

01:37:06.417 --> 01:37:08.292
[Marcus] Mm-hmm. We may have an idea.

01:37:09.875 --> 01:37:10.875
So, Reese.

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.167
What are you gonna do next?

01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:14.833
Well, actually, uh.

01:37:14.917 --> 01:37:17.833
I think I'll be heading back up
to San Francisco for a bit.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.708
For, like, ten to 20 years.

01:37:21.583 --> 01:37:22.958
Dad! What?

01:37:24.042 --> 01:37:25.417
Aw, honey.

01:37:26.625 --> 01:37:29.333
I am so goddamn grateful
I got to spend time with you.

01:37:30.583 --> 01:37:34.333
But there's one thing that I haven't
exactly been straight with you about.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.292
You do like to shit in front of people?

01:37:37.875 --> 01:37:39.000
No, no. It's--

01:37:39.083 --> 01:37:43.375
It's just that I wasn't really paroled,
like I told you.

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.250
I kinda broke out.

01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:48.667
Which was stupid, I know.
But it was worth it. I got to see you.

01:37:50.333 --> 01:37:52.333
You and your family. All of you.

01:37:53.208 --> 01:37:54.375
Reese Hackford?

01:37:55.542 --> 01:37:56.667
That's me.

01:37:56.750 --> 01:38:00.292
-FBI. Hands behind your head, please.
-[agent] Everybody, step back.

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:02.667
-Come on.
-Thanks for having me, honey.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:06.625
-[Reese] I hope I didn't ruin everything.
-Dad, are you kidding?

01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:08.958
I got to snort my own mom.

01:38:10.542 --> 01:38:12.083
This was the best honeymoon ever.

01:38:12.625 --> 01:38:13.708
-And Ron…
-Down on the ground.

01:38:13.792 --> 01:38:15.208
…you were right. [grunts]

01:38:16.292 --> 01:38:17.500
I was threatened by you.

01:38:18.083 --> 01:38:20.333
But you know why? Because you're great.

01:38:20.917 --> 01:38:24.083
In all the ways that I'm not.
And that's a lot of fucking ways.

01:38:24.583 --> 01:38:26.458
Sorry I was such a dick.

01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:29.625
And the truth is
I couldn't imagine a better son-in-law.

01:38:29.708 --> 01:38:30.917
[agent] Come on. Get up.

01:38:31.792 --> 01:38:33.500
-I don't know what to say.
-[chuckles]

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.917
Except for when our kid gets married,

01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.958
I hope I'm the type of father
that would break out of prison

01:38:39.042 --> 01:38:41.125
to face another ten to 20 years
just to see him.

01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:43.417
-[agent] Time to go. Let's move.
-[police radio chatter]

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.000
So nice to meet you both.

01:38:45.583 --> 01:38:47.708
-And you too, Chencho.
-Hmm?

01:38:47.792 --> 01:38:50.542
-Okay. It's just a joke. It's a joke.
-[agent] Come on, let's go.

01:38:50.625 --> 01:38:52.292
[Kyla] I love you so much, Daddy.

01:38:52.792 --> 01:38:54.125
Have a great flight.

01:38:57.375 --> 01:38:58.583
What are we doing tonight?

01:38:59.083 --> 01:39:01.375
It's our last night in the Caribbean.

01:39:01.875 --> 01:39:03.792
Well, I have a date.

01:39:03.875 --> 01:39:04.875
With who?

01:39:04.958 --> 01:39:07.000
-With her. Veronika.
-[Emily] Oh.

01:39:07.083 --> 01:39:09.833
I finally found the nerve
to ask her out to dinner.

01:39:09.917 --> 01:39:13.875
You see, playing a drug dealer almost
may have gotten us shot in the face,

01:39:14.375 --> 01:39:16.250
but it also unleashed
something inside of me.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.917
Apparently, I can be the killer after all.

01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:21.958
Till tomorrow.

01:39:22.042 --> 01:39:23.458
[squeals, laughs]

01:39:23.542 --> 01:39:25.167
[Emily] All right, Chencho.

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:27.292
[Maurillio] Hi.

01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:28.375
[chatters]

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:31.292
So what about us, you guys?
Should we get some drinks?

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:33.583
Yeah. We should definitely
get drinks and dinner.

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.417
And maybe, like, the casino after?

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.958
Girl, you know I'm not allowed
back in there. Like, ever.

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:40.167
You know what, you guys go ahead.

01:39:47.208 --> 01:39:49.458
I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:57.250
[blows]
