00:04.059 --> 00:06.200
Previously on
"The Enemy Within"...

00:06.240 --> 00:08.550
- I worked with Laine.
- I'm sorry.

00:08.590 --> 00:10.070
I know our two agencies
haven't always

00:10.110 --> 00:11.420
worked well together
in the past,

00:11.460 --> 00:12.786
but we're willing to do
anything in our power

00:12.810 --> 00:14.030
to find those responsible.

00:14.070 --> 00:15.250
You're working with her?

00:15.290 --> 00:17.600
She's responsible for
my daughter's murder.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.356
Dean asked me to research
something for him.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.600
It was a name, Sierra Maestra;
a mountain range in Cuba.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.480
I think whatever Dean was
killed over

00:24.520 --> 00:26.130
had something to do with Cuba.

00:26.170 --> 00:29.050
Tal, three years ago
you made me an offer.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.610
You want me to work for you?

00:30.660 --> 00:33.180
Feed me intelligence,
protect me from your country.

00:33.220 --> 00:36.490
I want you to feel the noose
of incarceration

00:36.530 --> 00:38.400
tightening around your neck.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.490
Only then do I want your answer.

00:40.530 --> 00:45.540
I am not going to die in a cage.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:07.650 --> 01:09.870
How did he first approach you?

01:09.910 --> 01:12.610
What did he say?

01:13.790 --> 01:15.106
Come on, Carla,
you have to remember

01:15.130 --> 01:16.740
the first time
you met Mikhail Tal.

01:16.790 --> 01:18.830
I told you.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.750
I've never spoken to Tal
in my life.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.800
Bowman, heads up.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.840
We're six miles out from
the location now.

01:27.890 --> 01:30.110
Copy that.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.630
We have you on
surveillance outside

01:31.670 --> 01:34.280
the National Intelligence
Center in Madrid.

01:34.330 --> 01:37.200
The same building Tal
destroyed earlier this month.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.250
We both know that building
doesn't come down

01:39.290 --> 01:40.730
without your
engineering expertise.

01:40.770 --> 01:42.770
Tal ordered you to carry out
that attack.

01:42.810 --> 01:44.730
So don't sit there and try to
make me believe

01:44.770 --> 01:46.120
you've never spoken to him.

01:46.170 --> 01:47.690
I'm only a teacher.

01:47.730 --> 01:49.820
What would Tal possibly
want with me?

01:51.210 --> 01:52.740
Tal's trained you well.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.350
So maybe you think you can
hold up under interrogation.

01:55.390 --> 01:57.700
Maybe you already have.

02:03.620 --> 02:06.450
But Carla...

02:06.490 --> 02:09.750
I know everything about you.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.450
I know all your secrets,
all your fears.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.460
That's why sooner or later
you're going to tell me

02:16.500 --> 02:19.850
everything you know about Tal.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.720
If you say so.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.900
Turn off's approaching
on your right-hand side.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.380
I see it.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.850
- What the hell was that?
- Convoy's under attack.

03:01.890 --> 03:02.890
Stay there.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.560
- Two gunmen outside...
- coming for us.

03:17.870 --> 03:19.520
Coming around back.

03:30.570 --> 03:31.920
We need to get out of here now.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.930
It's our only chance.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.860
- Tell them anything?
- What do you think?

03:58.910 --> 04:01.340
He caught you in the shoulder.

04:01.390 --> 04:03.300
Call a doctor.

04:14.050 --> 04:16.920
Earlier this morning,
a prisoner in CIA custody

04:16.970 --> 04:18.839
escaped during transport.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.450
Her name is Carla Mendoza.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.580
She's a structural engineer
and served three years

04:22.630 --> 04:25.060
with the Spanish Special
Operations Group.

04:25.110 --> 04:27.410
She also happens to be
one of Tal's top lieutenants.

04:27.460 --> 04:30.420
Our reports say Mendoza
was killed in Spain last week.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.640
That was a CIA cover story
spun by us

04:32.680 --> 04:34.420
in order to buy more time
alone with her.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.770
The truth is,
she was apprehended in Madrid.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.950
This morning,
en route to Langley,

04:38.990 --> 04:41.340
Tal operatives ambushed
her convoy.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.430
Five private security
contractors were killed,

04:44.470 --> 04:47.740
including one of
my top interrogators.

04:47.780 --> 04:48.976
He was with my team for years.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.066
That's a major operation
to mount

04:50.090 --> 04:51.660
just to break out one person.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.766
Like I said, we think she's
of huge significance to Tal.

04:53.790 --> 04:54.896
Any leads on her whereabouts?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.960
Well, if he did,
he wouldn't be here.

04:57.010 --> 04:58.790
Trust me, there's nothing
the CIA hates more

04:58.840 --> 05:00.750
than asking the FBI for help.

05:00.790 --> 05:03.010
Especially when
they're working with a traitor.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.800
So how can we help you
find Mendoza?

05:05.840 --> 05:07.450
Dr. Alan Novak,

05:07.500 --> 05:09.800
he's a physician on
Tal's payroll.

05:09.850 --> 05:11.370
30 minutes after she escaped,

05:11.410 --> 05:12.810
he walked into CIA Headquarters

05:12.850 --> 05:15.030
and said he knew where
she was hiding.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.200
How would he know that?

05:18.250 --> 05:19.616
During her escape,
she was shot in the shoulder.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.640
Novak was asked to treat her.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.470
Why'd he come to you?

05:24.430 --> 05:26.910
Novak wants out of
Tal's organization.

05:26.950 --> 05:28.740
In exchange for a new life,

05:28.780 --> 05:31.040
immunity from prosecution,
and federal protection,

05:31.090 --> 05:34.520
he is offering us
Mendoza on a silver platter.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.506
But there's something that's
stopping him from cooperating?

05:36.530 --> 05:38.400
Or someone.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.960
Four years ago,
Novak thought about

05:40.010 --> 05:42.400
leaving Tal's organization.

05:42.450 --> 05:45.450
He even contacted an agent
at the CIA,

05:45.490 --> 05:48.060
a woman named Rebecca Martin.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.100
Martin and Novak talked
for months.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.890
He came to trust her.

05:51.930 --> 05:55.500
And now, she's the only person
he's willing to talk to.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.850
So who is Rebecca Martin?

06:01.640 --> 06:04.380
I am.

06:04.420 --> 06:08.430
Rebecca Martin was an alias
I used for covert operations.

06:08.470 --> 06:10.690
I'm the one that spoke to
Novak four years ago.

06:10.730 --> 06:13.870
- I need you to do it again.
- You're asking for my help?

06:13.910 --> 06:16.000
I wanna find Mendoza.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.700
Novak said she's stable,

06:17.740 --> 06:20.400
but she's losing blood
and she's in shock.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.750
We have three, maybe four hours
at the most.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.620
Where is he?

06:26.660 --> 06:27.790
Langley.

06:31.230 --> 06:32.930
I'll let security at
the Agency know

06:32.970 --> 06:34.450
we're on our way over.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.800
Shepherd's right.

06:35.850 --> 06:38.500
CIA's only working with us
'cause they have to.

06:38.540 --> 06:39.696
Once Mendoza's in their custody,

06:39.720 --> 06:41.070
we'll never see her again.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.550
Which means we need to
get to her first.

06:43.590 --> 06:47.120
Now, details of Mendoza's
transport were classified.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.080
Tal's operatives had to have
gotten them somehow.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.900
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

06:50.950 --> 06:53.560
Tal had an inside man
on that convoy.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.780
Pull the background
on all the private contractors.

06:55.820 --> 06:58.220
We find that inside man,
we find Mendoza.

07:04.610 --> 07:06.490
You sure you're ready for this?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.100
Do I look worried?

07:10.140 --> 07:12.116
You're walking into the CIA
as the most hated person

07:12.140 --> 07:14.150
in Agency history.

07:14.190 --> 07:16.036
I'm guessing they won't be
throwing you a party.

07:16.060 --> 07:20.060
How is that different from
any other room that I walk into?

07:20.110 --> 07:23.240
- All set.
- Let's move out.

08:05.980 --> 08:09.070
- Open your mouth.
- Lift your tongue.

08:10.330 --> 08:13.680
Clear.
What about the shackles?

08:13.730 --> 08:15.510
Leave 'em on.

08:39.710 --> 08:43.580
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please help me welcome our new

08:43.630 --> 08:46.760
Deputy Director of Operations,
Erica Shepherd.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.290
- Congratulations, boss.
- Thank you, Laine.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.560
Thank you.

09:09.870 --> 09:11.830
Thank you, Director Robert.

09:11.870 --> 09:14.960
We all know that
there are those intent

09:15.010 --> 09:16.660
on destroying our country;

09:16.700 --> 09:19.620
people who despise what
we stand for,

09:19.660 --> 09:22.620
who are determined to corrupt
our ideals

09:22.670 --> 09:26.320
and erode our belief in
basic intrinsic goodness.

09:26.360 --> 09:30.240
And the threats that
they present us with are real,

09:30.280 --> 09:31.800
and they are dangerous.

09:31.850 --> 09:36.720
And they are multiplying
exponentially every single day.

09:36.770 --> 09:39.290
But I have no fear.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.900
I know we will overcome
every challenge that

09:41.950 --> 09:44.640
we are presented with,
because I know firsthand

09:44.690 --> 09:47.650
the talent, the dedication,

09:47.690 --> 09:49.650
and the unerring integrity
in the hearts and minds

09:49.690 --> 09:51.870
of all of the patriots
in this room.

09:51.910 --> 09:54.310
You are on the first lines
of defense,

09:54.350 --> 09:57.350
and I am honored to be
at your side.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.750
So, for your trust
and your faith, thank you.

09:59.790 --> 10:02.050
And I give you my word,
I will not let you down.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.820
Welcome home.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.090
I got her from here.

11:14.210 --> 11:15.780
How are you, Sarah?

11:15.820 --> 11:17.780
I can't imagine it.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.350
What's that?

11:19.390 --> 11:20.870
What Laine would say.

11:43.540 --> 11:45.370
Dr. Alan Novak.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.370
That's him?

11:47.420 --> 11:48.696
What, you don't recognize him?

11:48.720 --> 11:50.770
Well, I've never met him.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.966
- What are you talking about?
- We never met in person.

11:52.990 --> 11:54.820
- You recruited him.
- With an alias.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.430
I never met him face-to-face.

11:56.470 --> 11:57.690
Okay, so how do we know that

11:57.730 --> 11:59.186
that's the same Alan Novak
you were talking to?

11:59.210 --> 12:01.350
- I don't.
- How 'bout we just find out.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.320
It's nice to finally
meet you in person.

12:24.930 --> 12:27.500
- I'm Rebecca Martin.
- No, you're not.

12:27.550 --> 12:29.630
I know who you are.
You're Erica Shepherd.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.200
You worked for Tal.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.566
- What is this?
- Just hear her out.

12:33.590 --> 12:35.340
She worked for Tal.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.056
This was a mistake.
I never should have come here.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.950
Richard Pearce was the alias
you used for our communication.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.910
Your decryption key for
my emails was

12:42.950 --> 12:45.560
7-5-tango-4-6-2-alpha-9.

12:46.610 --> 12:48.780
I am Rebecca Martin.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.570
We exchanged dozens of emails.

12:50.610 --> 12:53.480
Now is not the time to be shy,
Alan.

12:53.530 --> 12:55.336
The longer you sit here,
the less of a chance

12:55.360 --> 12:56.570
we have of finding Mendoza.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.840
She's running out of time.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.800
What do you wanna do, Doctor?

13:06.410 --> 13:07.646
Daniel, tell me
you got something.

13:07.670 --> 13:09.590
Tal had an insider
on the convoy.

13:09.630 --> 13:11.550
He's one of the private
military contractors.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.436
- His name is Luke Bowman.
- What do we have on him?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.770
I got in touch with the
owner of the security company.

13:15.810 --> 13:17.900
He said Bowman's been MIA
since the attack.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.510
We dug into Bowman's background.

13:19.550 --> 13:22.470
He's a former Marine who spent
15 years working K&R.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.666
He's an extraction specialist?

13:23.690 --> 13:25.300
One of the best in the world.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.780
We think Bowman was the one
who planned Mendoza's escape.

13:27.820 --> 13:28.820
Well, if you're right,

13:28.870 --> 13:30.130
I'm sure he's gonna try getting

13:30.170 --> 13:31.416
Mendoza out of the country
as soon as possible.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.626
I'll check every
private charter company

13:32.650 --> 13:33.870
in a 100-mile radius.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.350
Make sure you do it fast.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.456
If we made him this quickly,
CIA's not too far behind.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.570
Yeah, we're on it.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.720
I don't know about this.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.640
How do I know you're not still
working for Tal?

13:58.680 --> 13:59.960
I've spent the last three years

13:59.990 --> 14:01.680
of my life in prison.

14:01.730 --> 14:03.860
And up until recently,
that meant 23 hours a day

14:03.900 --> 14:06.730
of solitary confinement.

14:06.770 --> 14:08.820
I'm not sure you can even
imagine what that's like,

14:08.860 --> 14:12.350
not hearing another human voice
for days on end.

14:12.390 --> 14:14.520
It erodes you.

14:14.570 --> 14:17.440
Everything I valued in my life
was taken from me.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.880
And I should have known
it was gonna happen,

14:19.920 --> 14:21.960
because everyone who gets
involved with Tal

14:22.010 --> 14:26.490
either ends up dead
or in prison.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.970
And I promise you, Alan,
unless you talk to us now,

14:29.010 --> 14:31.890
one of those will be your fate.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.110
I thought it'd just be one job.

14:38.150 --> 14:40.940
I was helping somebody
who would have died otherwise.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.680
At least,
that's what I told myself.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.950
But Tal...

14:47.990 --> 14:49.560
he wouldn't let me stop.

14:52.650 --> 14:55.350
I have three boys, a wife...

14:55.390 --> 14:56.710
You want a better life for them.

14:56.740 --> 14:57.960
- Yes.
- Four years ago,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.700
I came to you with this choice,

14:59.740 --> 15:01.790
and you turned me down.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.830
So what's changed?
Why now?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.620
- Something happened.
- With your family?

15:05.660 --> 15:06.920
No...

15:06.970 --> 15:09.930
with Tal in Cuba.

15:12.190 --> 15:14.710
One of Tal's operatives
was injured in a firefight,

15:14.760 --> 15:16.670
and I was sent down to Havana
to treat him.

15:16.710 --> 15:17.850
But during the surgery,

15:17.890 --> 15:19.410
we were attacked by
the military.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.680
Bullets were flying,
hitting everywhere around me,

15:22.720 --> 15:27.070
but I had only one thought
running through my mind...

15:27.120 --> 15:30.640
my boys growing up
without a father.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.640
Has Tal ever sent you
to Cuba before?

15:32.690 --> 15:34.430
- No.
- Do you have any idea of

15:34.470 --> 15:35.756
what his operatives
are doing there?

15:35.780 --> 15:37.560
Okay, that's enough.

15:41.130 --> 15:43.570
Can I talk to you for a minute?

15:56.670 --> 15:59.060
We're on the clock, Shepherd.
We do not have time for this.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.410
What are you hiding about Cuba?

16:00.450 --> 16:01.930
Nothing.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.070
You used to be a better liar
than that.

16:04.110 --> 16:05.590
Found a number of leads linking

16:05.630 --> 16:07.550
Tal's activities to Cuba.

16:07.590 --> 16:08.786
If the CIA knows
something we don't,

16:08.810 --> 16:10.250
it might be
a good time to tell us.

16:10.290 --> 16:12.810
We are here to get Mendoza's
location out of Novak.

16:12.860 --> 16:14.550
Now, if you wanna help
with that, great.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.080
Go back in there.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.860
If not, walk.

16:25.090 --> 16:26.130
We got an address,

16:26.180 --> 16:28.480
5103 Ambrose Street in Rosslyn.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.116
Novak's supposed to meet there
in 30 minutes.

16:30.140 --> 16:31.960
Get a surveillance team
out there ASAP.

16:32.010 --> 16:33.440
We do not have much time.

16:33.490 --> 16:34.766
- Andrews, you can see them out.
- Wait.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.490
We're working on this together.

16:36.530 --> 16:39.580
Mendoza's not gonna be there.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.126
She's gonna be at a different
location by now,

16:41.150 --> 16:43.086
one they won't tell Novak about
until the last minute.

16:43.110 --> 16:44.556
- You don't know that.
- I know that Tal's gonna

16:44.580 --> 16:46.800
take every precaution possible
to protect Mendoza.

16:46.850 --> 16:48.086
- Why?
- For the same reason that he

16:48.110 --> 16:49.070
had a team of operatives

16:49.110 --> 16:50.980
interrupt
a CIA transport convoy.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.980
- Tal values Mendoza.
- For what?

16:53.030 --> 16:55.860
- I don't know.
- You know she's right.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.096
Let us work this out with you.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.640
I knew it was just
a matter of time

16:58.690 --> 17:00.170
before this would happen.

17:00.210 --> 17:04.210
- We're done.
- I got Novak to talk.

17:04.260 --> 17:05.910
I got you an address.

17:05.950 --> 17:08.040
Don't let your personal
feelings towards me

17:08.089 --> 17:09.740
get in the way of you
doing your job.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.130
I... I don't know how you do it.

17:12.180 --> 17:13.480
She's an asset, that's how.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.010
One that you're already
working with.

17:15.050 --> 17:16.675
Don't pretend you're above
asking for our help.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.880
Look, we both want
the same thing here.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.190
Let's go get her.

17:23.060 --> 17:25.630
All right, let's work
this one together.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.980
We both know this isn't
just about helping the CIA.

17:34.030 --> 17:36.070
You wanna know what
they're doing in Cuba.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.990
Don't you?

17:40.030 --> 17:41.160
Of course.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.730
Well, whatever it is, it's big.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.820
You see the badges that
they're wearing over there?

17:46.860 --> 17:47.886
That means they were read into

17:47.910 --> 17:50.130
a Top Secret
Special Access Program.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.650
That only happened a handful
of times while I was here.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.156
The safes in the corner,
they're class four.

17:54.180 --> 17:56.740
They're brought in for
highly sensitive information.

17:56.790 --> 17:59.660
And that team of
senior analysts...

17:59.700 --> 18:01.010
I worked with them.

18:01.050 --> 18:04.270
They specialize in Tal's
Latin American activities.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.010
I don't know what Tal's doing
in Cuba,

18:06.060 --> 18:07.060
but I'm gonna find out.

18:07.100 --> 18:10.890
A- How?

18:10.930 --> 18:12.980
I'm gonna spy on the CIA.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.330
What's the status?

18:21.380 --> 18:22.746
Just pulled up to
the address in Rosslyn,

18:22.770 --> 18:25.420
but nothing to report here,
no signs of Mendoza.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.380
Okay, let's just give it
a minute.

18:36.610 --> 18:38.130
That's a STE phone.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.870
It's used to
make encrypted calls.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.180
So?

18:41.220 --> 18:44.270
So he just got it out of
a class four safe.

18:44.310 --> 18:45.790
Whatever he's discussing is at

18:45.840 --> 18:49.190
the highest level of
security clearance.

18:49.230 --> 18:51.930
I wanna know what
he's talking about.

18:51.970 --> 18:53.370
So do I.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.720
There's no shades on
the windows,

18:58.760 --> 19:01.500
multiple lines of sight
into the residence...

19:01.550 --> 19:03.250
this isn't the place.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.250
I need to use the restroom.

19:24.610 --> 19:26.360
Sierra Maestra...

19:54.730 --> 19:56.706
- Daniel, what's up?
- We may have a lead on Bowman.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.950
Yeah, this morning,
a heliport in Anacostia

19:59.000 --> 20:01.690
received a wire transfer from
an untraceable Swiss account.

20:01.740 --> 20:04.610
Whoever sent the payment
rented a medevac helicopter.

20:04.650 --> 20:06.350
We think Bowman's using
the helicopter

20:06.400 --> 20:08.416
to pick up Mendoza and then get
her on a private plane

20:08.440 --> 20:09.620
out of the country.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.270
There's no signs
of Bowman yet, though.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.726
He shows up,
you do whatever you can

20:12.750 --> 20:14.580
to take him in alive.

20:14.620 --> 20:15.726
Let me know when
you have something.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.360
We're running out of time
on our end.

20:25.330 --> 20:26.460
What'd he say?

20:26.500 --> 20:28.720
"Sierra Maestra."

20:28.770 --> 20:30.826
Mountain range in Cuba
Dean Merriman was investigating.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.290
Right before he was murdered.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.900
What does the CIA have to do
with Tal and Cuba?

20:34.950 --> 20:37.990
I don't know.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.300
But I know someone
who could help.

20:47.310 --> 20:49.050
I gotta call you back.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.140
Yes?

20:52.180 --> 20:53.960
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out?

20:54.010 --> 20:55.750
What are you talking about?

20:56.840 --> 20:59.400
Sierra Maestra.

20:59.450 --> 21:00.490
Never heard of it.

21:00.540 --> 21:03.840
- Oh, you have.
- You all have.

21:03.890 --> 21:05.320
CIA's planning an operation
there.

21:05.370 --> 21:08.410
- What do you want, Shepherd?
- I wanna be read in.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.070
I have information
I know you'll want,

21:10.110 --> 21:11.176
and I think we should share.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.550
I think we should help
each other.

21:12.590 --> 21:13.850
You gotta be kidding me.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.550
No.

21:15.590 --> 21:17.900
Excuse me.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.610
Sarah's a rule follower.

21:27.650 --> 21:29.430
Everything's by the book.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.000
Security breaches
are supposed to be

21:31.040 --> 21:33.610
immediately reported
to the operation supervisor.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.440
That's what she'll do.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.450
I'll follow her,
see who she reports to.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.900
What division's on
the fifth floor?

22:04.950 --> 22:06.990
Uh... logistics directorate.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.470
They're in charge of
off-book transportation.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.960
What's the CIA bringing to
a mountain range in Cuba?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.480
Novak just got a text.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.830
New location for the meeting,
some diner in Arlington.

22:15.870 --> 22:17.870
He's supposed to be there
in 15 minutes.

22:19.050 --> 22:20.790
Come on.

22:23.450 --> 22:25.140
I'll be following
right behind you, Alan.

22:25.190 --> 22:26.466
Aren't you gonna put
some kind of

22:26.490 --> 22:27.750
a tracking device on me?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.426
Tal's operatives will be
looking for that.

22:29.450 --> 22:30.970
We can't risk it.

22:31.020 --> 22:32.036
I don't know if I can do this.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.410
Yes, you can.

22:34.460 --> 22:36.020
Start driving.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.810
Let's go.

23:04.440 --> 23:07.050
- Here we go, black car.
- That's Bowman.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.800
All right, let's go.

23:22.070 --> 23:23.200
- Bowman!
- FBI!

23:23.240 --> 23:24.460
Get down.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.030
Get down!

23:27.070 --> 23:28.030
Hey, hey!

23:28.070 --> 23:29.640
Don't fight.

23:33.990 --> 23:36.910
- Let him go, Bowman!
- Stay back!

23:36.950 --> 23:39.130
Stay back or he dies.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.450
Daniel, I'm in position
for a shot.

23:55.490 --> 23:57.360
- Stand down.
- We need him alive.

23:57.410 --> 23:59.240
Pettigrew is gonna try
to talk him down.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.280
Understood.

24:01.330 --> 24:03.200
Don't come any closer!

24:03.240 --> 24:05.020
- You got this, Jacquie?
- Yeah.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.200
I got this.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.290
Bowman, you've got options here.

24:08.330 --> 24:10.510
You just need to talk to me.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.250
- Stay back!
- Okay, I'm stopping.

24:13.290 --> 24:16.690
Easy, easy.

24:18.860 --> 24:20.260
Easy.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.310
I'm trusting you.

24:26.350 --> 24:29.960
And I need you to trust me.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.360
FBI.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.450
Bragg, stand by.

24:37.490 --> 24:38.970
Pettigrew's out on a limb
right now.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.450
- I can take him.
- Negative.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.946
The primary objective is
capture unless there's

24:41.970 --> 24:42.930
imminent threat to the hostage.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.410
- Understood?
- Understood.

24:48.940 --> 24:51.030
You've got to be honest
with yourself.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.810
It's time to put the weapon down

24:55.860 --> 24:58.510
and let that innocent man go.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.430
- No.
- Bowman!

25:01.520 --> 25:03.520
He's headed for the chopper.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.150
Don't do anything until
you hear my command.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.530
We can't let him take off.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.540
Ow.

25:27.540 --> 25:29.280
Take the shot.

25:29.330 --> 25:30.590
Take the shot!

25:31.680 --> 25:33.460
- Shots fired.
- Shots fired.

26:25.860 --> 26:27.140
He's not going to the location.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.470
I told you he'd be given
another address.

26:38.570 --> 26:40.350
Daniel, what do you got?

26:40.400 --> 26:42.140
We had to take Bowman out.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.530
He posed a threat
to the hostage.

26:43.570 --> 26:45.156
- We didn't have a choice.
- Did you get anything?

26:45.180 --> 26:47.530
Yeah, his cell phone,
a series of encrypted texts.

26:47.580 --> 26:48.670
Kate's working on it now.

26:48.710 --> 26:49.670
He's pulling over.

26:49.710 --> 26:52.240
Gotta go, keep me posted.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.110
Novak's stopping.

27:10.950 --> 27:12.560
Where is he going?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.570
Agents, we're at an alley
off Mason Road and Del Rey.

27:19.610 --> 27:21.090
- Proceeding on foot.
- Wait.

27:21.130 --> 27:22.700
- What?
- We're losing him.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.376
- That alley, it bottlenecks.
- You can't follow him down there.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.920
One of his operatives
will see you.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.286
Why do you think they're
sending him down a narrow alley?

27:27.310 --> 27:28.580
Novak's being watched.

27:28.620 --> 27:30.246
You follow him now,
you're gonna be exposed,

27:30.270 --> 27:31.970
the whole operation's
gonna be blown.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.130
Go, go, go.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.930
Agents, we lost Novak.
You got a visual on him?

28:13.970 --> 28:15.970
- No, we don't have him.
- He's gone.

28:17.450 --> 28:19.150
Damn it.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.200
Get facial recognition on
tolls and subways,

28:23.240 --> 28:24.460
and move the perimeter out.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.630
I want a status report in 20.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.740
Something's wrong.

28:44.780 --> 28:47.090
- The team tracked down Bowman.
- He took a hostage.

28:47.130 --> 28:49.350
Bragg had to take him out.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.570
You're running your own op.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.620
Your people found
the convoy driver and shot him.

28:53.660 --> 28:55.140
He was a critical asset.

28:55.180 --> 28:57.710
It was the only way
we could protect a civilian.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.296
You and Shepherd have been
running your own game

28:59.320 --> 29:00.760
from the start.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.190
I should've known.

29:02.230 --> 29:05.370
We know about
Sierra Maestra, and so does Tal.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.550
You're transporting something
to Cuba,

29:08.590 --> 29:11.200
and I'm guessing that something
is either weapons or people.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.656
Whatever it is,
it's either illegal

29:12.680 --> 29:14.510
or it's very embarrassing
to the Agency.

29:14.550 --> 29:17.990
Either way, we'll find out.

29:18.030 --> 29:21.510
Situations like these,
there's always a scandal,

29:21.560 --> 29:24.040
there's always a fall guy.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.520
Sure would hate for that
to be you.

29:27.130 --> 29:29.040
Good luck with that,
Agent Keaton.

29:34.090 --> 29:35.270
I have something.

29:35.310 --> 29:36.830
I just decrypted Bowman's texts.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.530
He sent a string of
numbers and letters

29:38.580 --> 29:40.360
to an unknown number.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.360
So at first I assumed it was
some sort of coded message,

29:44.410 --> 29:46.150
but that's not what
we're dealing with...

29:46.190 --> 29:48.190
1-8-S-U-J.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.590
That's a grid zone designation.

29:49.630 --> 29:51.370
You said Bowman was
former military?

29:51.410 --> 29:53.550
That's a location marker.

29:53.590 --> 29:54.696
That's where
they're hiding Mendoza.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.070
That's what I was thinking.

29:56.110 --> 29:57.770
I have an address for you.

29:57.810 --> 30:01.510
It's 2076 Norfolk Street,
Annapolis.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.250
- Got it.
- We're on our way.

30:18.830 --> 30:20.360
Just pulled up.
What's your ETA?

30:20.400 --> 30:21.880
I'm 20 minutes out.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.750
Any idea how many operatives
we're dealing with?

30:24.800 --> 30:27.150
No, there's no visuals
from here.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.230
I'm gonna do some recon.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.150
We'll game plan
when you get here.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.850
- Let me come.
- I can help.

30:37.370 --> 30:38.850
Here's a walkie
in case you need me.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.600
Keaton...

31:04.270 --> 31:05.580
New instructions just came in.

31:05.620 --> 31:06.840
What's going on?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.206
Tal thinks the doctor
may have been

31:08.230 --> 31:09.580
working with the CIA.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.490
We take him out as soon as
he finishes surgery.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.320
We need you back here now.

31:13.370 --> 31:14.580
On my way.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.456
Now it's a change of plans.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.830
I'm moving in now.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.286
- What are you doing, Will?
- We're on our way.

31:47.310 --> 31:49.710
- There's not enough time.
- He's gonna kill Novak.

31:49.750 --> 31:53.540
- Will?
- Will?

32:50.380 --> 32:51.860
The surgery's almost complete.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.290
I need one of you guys
up here now.

32:56.210 --> 32:58.120
- Copy that.
- On my way.

33:30.110 --> 33:31.900
Keep working.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.060
- Are you okay?
- You okay?

34:06.970 --> 34:08.239
Don't shoot.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.110
Mendoza, she's upstairs, alive.

34:31.130 --> 34:33.780
So, I've been in touch
with the CIA

34:33.830 --> 34:35.090
regarding your situation.

34:35.130 --> 34:37.400
And unfortunately,
since Carla Mendoza's

34:37.440 --> 34:39.830
in FBI custody,
they no longer feel the need

34:39.880 --> 34:42.270
to put you in
their relocation program.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.270
I see.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.929
But here at the FBI,
we feel differently.

34:49.969 --> 34:51.346
You were a huge part of
Mendoza's arrest,

34:51.370 --> 34:53.150
so we're gonna help you.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.255
We're gonna put you in the FBI's

34:54.280 --> 34:56.280
witness protection program
today.

34:56.330 --> 34:57.420
You have a new life.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.460
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

35:00.510 --> 35:02.200
An agent will be in here shortly

35:02.250 --> 35:03.860
to fill you in on
all the details.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.900
Good luck.

35:09.470 --> 35:10.870
I can't believe
this is happening.

35:10.910 --> 35:13.260
I never thought I would be
out from under Tal,

35:13.300 --> 35:17.170
but now my family has
a second chance.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.090
I don't know what to say.

35:19.130 --> 35:20.570
There's nothing to say.

35:23.490 --> 35:25.050
Goodbye, Alan.

35:28.490 --> 35:30.190
How are you feeling?

35:32.060 --> 35:33.150
Hm?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.500
You look like you're doing
much better today.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.160
You don't wanna talk to us,
I understand.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.030
The thing is, sooner or later
you're gonna have to.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.520
We don't just give up
on people like you, Carla.

35:55.260 --> 35:58.220
- We know who you are now.
- You know nothing about me.

36:03.530 --> 36:06.440
We know you are not
just one of Tal's operatives.

36:06.480 --> 36:10.230
You were in a relationship
with him for years.

36:10.270 --> 36:11.620
You're his confidant.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.190
That makes you
a very important person.

36:16.630 --> 36:19.190
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.060
Luke Bowman.

36:21.110 --> 36:23.980
He knew all about you
and your relationship with Tal.

36:24.020 --> 36:26.940
We read his texts, his emails,
his files...

36:30.160 --> 36:33.030
You look tired.

36:33.080 --> 36:36.080
I'm gonna let you rest
for a while.

36:36.120 --> 36:40.260
And we're gonna have
another chat.

36:40.300 --> 36:43.300
And we're gonna be
honest with each other.

36:49.350 --> 36:51.960
I've never seen someone
this close to Tal before.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.116
Imagine what she could tell us.

36:53.140 --> 36:55.620
And now she's vulnerable.

36:55.660 --> 36:56.710
I think we can turn her.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.060
This is Keaton.

37:03.540 --> 37:06.110
On my way.
Be right back.

37:14.730 --> 37:18.250
Wondered how long it'd be
before you came back.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.470
We need to talk about Mendoza.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.430
She's our prisoner,
Agent Keaton.

37:22.470 --> 37:23.560
We captured her in Bilbao.

37:23.610 --> 37:25.220
Then you lost her
on American soil,

37:25.260 --> 37:27.000
and we got her back.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.650
She's ours.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.310
This isn't Langley.

37:30.350 --> 37:32.610
You're in the Hoover Building
now.

37:32.660 --> 37:37.310
We'll be doing things my way,
by my rules.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.140
And what are those?

37:39.190 --> 37:42.620
Good old-fashioned inside
the Beltway horse-trading.

37:42.670 --> 37:44.500
We'll share what we get
on Mendoza...

37:44.540 --> 37:46.150
transcripts, all of it.

37:46.190 --> 37:48.330
But you're gonna tell me
everything you know

37:48.370 --> 37:50.630
about Sierra Maestra.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.020
That's the deal.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.330
What did he tell you?

37:57.380 --> 37:58.616
Over the past few years,
the CIA's

37:58.640 --> 38:02.210
had a series of problems
with security breaches.

38:02.250 --> 38:03.510
You were their case in point.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.170
They wanted a way to safeguard

38:05.210 --> 38:07.040
their most important
intelligence,

38:07.080 --> 38:08.326
starting with
the Tal investigation.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.690
So about six months ago,

38:09.740 --> 38:12.180
they started sending all of
their Tal prisoners

38:12.220 --> 38:14.530
to a black site detention center

38:14.570 --> 38:16.350
in a Cuban mountain range.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.220
- Sierra Maestra.
- Exactly.

38:18.270 --> 38:20.180
It's like a Guantanamo
for Tal operatives.

38:20.230 --> 38:22.270
I can't believe you got
Cabrera to crack.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.426
Yeah, he wasn't
too happy about it.

38:23.450 --> 38:26.540
- I bet.
- That's impressive.

38:26.580 --> 38:29.540
Had some help.

38:31.330 --> 38:33.500
- Good night.
- Yeah.

38:37.290 --> 38:38.640
Agent Keaton.

38:41.730 --> 38:45.030
All the pain
you've been through...

38:45.080 --> 38:46.380
all the pain you've

38:46.430 --> 38:50.520
put the people
in your life through...

38:50.560 --> 38:52.560
you're gonna see that
it all has honor

38:52.610 --> 38:54.650
when we catch Tal.

38:56.790 --> 38:58.830
See you tomorrow.

39:26.820 --> 39:28.380
What do you want?

39:28.430 --> 39:30.380
- Thomas, listen.
- I... I just wanted...

39:30.430 --> 39:32.430
What do you want, Will?

39:34.740 --> 39:36.220
I understand why you hate me.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.440
You... you need to leave.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.790
But... but working with Shepherd
is not easy for me.

39:43.610 --> 39:44.920
After what she did to Laine,

39:44.960 --> 39:47.360
do you know, it crosses my mind
every single time

39:47.400 --> 39:48.880
that I look at her.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.270
It's the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

39:55.500 --> 39:59.370
I loved your daughter
more than life itself.

39:59.410 --> 40:02.330
And I know you did too.

40:02.370 --> 40:04.590
We share that same grief.

40:04.640 --> 40:07.640
But this is not about Shepherd.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.340
This is about finding the man

40:09.380 --> 40:12.900
that's responsible
for all of this.

40:12.950 --> 40:16.520
I am not trying to
cause you any pain.

40:16.560 --> 40:20.480
It's just what I have to do.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.130
And I think that if...

40:23.180 --> 40:24.196
I think if you were in my shoes,

40:24.220 --> 40:26.310
you'd make
the same choices I did.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.490
Will.

40:39.370 --> 40:41.670
Come on inside.
Come on.

41:08.570 --> 41:09.586
You have Tal's attention now.

41:09.610 --> 41:10.790
Prove you wanna work for him,

41:10.830 --> 41:12.400
or there will be consequences.
