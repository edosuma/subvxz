00:31.431 --> 00:33.433
IT'S ME, SASHA.
YOUR NEIGHBOR.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.836
ARE YOU HOME?

00:35.836 --> 00:38.038
COME ON, YOU OLD CRONE.
YOU'RE ALWAYS HOME.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.041
GINNY, HEY. IT'S ME.
I JUST GOT HOME

00:41.041 --> 00:42.442
AND MY FRONT DOOR
IS WIDE OPEN.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.045
NOT SURE WHAT TO DO.
CALL ME.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.047
<i>( phone beeps )</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:49.049
MRS. WEIDEMEYER,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.490
IF YOU'RE THERE
AND YOU HEARD

00:50.490 --> 00:52.052
THAT UNFORTUNATE
VERBAL SLIP I JUST MADE,

00:52.052 --> 00:53.614
I'M VERY SORRY,
IT CAME OUT OF THE MOMENT,

00:53.614 --> 00:55.215
AND I WANT TO
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

00:55.215 --> 00:57.057
I THINK YOU HAVE
AN MRI NEXT WEEK?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.458
LOVE TO BE YOUR WHEELS.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.064
BOO? NOT THERE. OKAY.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.626
WHAT GOOD ARE CELLPHONES?

01:05.626 --> 01:07.187
LOOK, THERE MIGHT BE
A BURGLAR IN MY PLACE.

01:07.187 --> 01:08.068
CALL ME.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.473

‐ HEAVEN.

01:57.838 --> 01:59.119
‐ WHOA.
‐ WHAT?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.841
‐ I THINK I JUST SAW GOD.
‐ FROM EATING A MARSHMALLOW?

02:00.841 --> 02:02.603
‐ HIS WAYS ARE STRANGE.
‐ WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

02:02.603 --> 02:04.765
‐ JUDY GARLAND.
‐ GOD'S A GOOD GIG FOR HER.

02:04.765 --> 02:06.286
YOU'RE FALLING BEHIND,
TRULY.

02:06.286 --> 02:07.848
COME.
HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

02:07.848 --> 02:09.289
YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING.

02:09.289 --> 02:11.011
"MY HIPS SAY NO,
BUT MY MOUTH SAYS

02:11.011 --> 02:12.452
GET IN THERE, TRULY,
AND ENJOY SOMETHING

02:12.452 --> 02:14.134
WITHOUT FEELING
THE LIFE‐SUCKING GUILT

02:14.134 --> 02:15.736
YOUR MOTHER BEAT INTO YOU
FOR 20 YEARS."

02:15.736 --> 02:17.137
IS THAT HOW
THE OLD SAYING GOES?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.378
‐ WORD FOR WORD.
‐ <i>( cellphone ringing )</i>

02:18.378 --> 02:21.301
COOLNESS. A TEXT
FROM MY FIANCE.

02:21.301 --> 02:23.544
OH, THEY CAN TEXT ON
LIFE ALERT PENDANTS
NOW?

02:23.544 --> 02:24.945
IGNORING THAT.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.947
HE'S ALL PACKED AND READY
TO DRIVE OUT HERE TOMORROW.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.228
HIS BEST MAN'S
RIDING SHOTGUN.

02:28.228 --> 02:29.710
THEY HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
SINCE GRADE SCHOOL.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.431
‐ ISN'T THAT CUTE?
‐ THEY CAN REMINISCE
ABOUT SOUP LINES

02:31.431 --> 02:32.753
AND ICE WAGONS.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.955
BEST MAN? WHEN ARE YOU
AND RICK GETTING MARRIED?

02:34.955 --> 02:36.877
TOMORROW.
ON THE BEACH AT SUNSET.

02:36.877 --> 02:38.559
RECEPTION TO FOLLOW
AT THE MADONNA INN.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.160
THE WEIRDEST, COOLEST
PLACE IN CALI.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.044
AH, GIRLS, YOU KNOW WHAT
MARRYING A LOVELY MAN OF
MEANS MEANS?

02:44.044 --> 02:46.166
NO MORE PERFORMING.
I CAN HANG UP THE TIGHTS,

02:46.166 --> 02:48.408
HANG UP THE HEADDRESSES.
DO YOU KNOW I HAVE WORKED

02:48.408 --> 02:50.330
EVERY NEW YEAR'S EVE
SINCE I WAS 17?

02:50.330 --> 02:52.172
I HAVE NEVER
CELEBRATED NEW YEAR'S.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.014
NOW RICK AND I CAN
CELEBRATE NEW YEAR'S.

02:54.014 --> 02:55.175
All: IF HE MAKES IT
TO NEW YEAR'S.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.057
‐ SO OBVIOUS.
‐ GETTING SLOPPY.

02:57.057 --> 02:58.338
AND I CAN CRAFT.

02:58.338 --> 02:59.259
I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO CRAFT.

02:59.259 --> 03:00.701
YOU HAVE NEVER
WANTED TO CRAFT.

03:00.701 --> 03:02.823
WELL, I DO NOW.
IT'LL BE DIRTY CRAFTING,

03:02.823 --> 03:04.184
BUT IT'LL BE CRAFTING.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.186
AND I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO THE GYM SIX DAYS A WEEK.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.188
I CAN EVEN GAIN
THREE POUNDS.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.711
‐ THINK ABOUT THAT!
‐ I'D STILL LOVE YOU
IF YOU GAINED FIVE.

03:10.711 --> 03:12.432
AND I CAN GET A PACK
OF PEKINGESE TO GREET
ME AT THE DOOR

03:12.432 --> 03:14.995
WHEN I COME HOME FROM
NOT WORKING OR WORKING OUT.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.998
AND I CAN FEED THEM FROM
MY GIANT BOWL OF BONBONS.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.000
WHAT'S A PEKINGESE?
LONG‐HAIRED DOG?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.682
SHORT HAIR.
I THINK, YEAH. SHORT.

03:21.682 --> 03:22.763
AND YOU WON'T
MISS PERFORMING?

03:22.763 --> 03:24.204
THAT'S YOUR THING,
NOT MINE.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.566
BECAUSE RICK'S
YOUR THING NOW.

03:25.566 --> 03:26.727
RICK'S MY THING.

03:26.727 --> 03:28.368
AND MICHELLE'S
YOUR MAID OF HONOR?

03:28.368 --> 03:30.290
OH, WE DIDN'T EVEN
TALK ABOUT THAT.

03:30.290 --> 03:31.331
I'LL DO IT
IF YOU WANT ME TO?

03:31.331 --> 03:32.773
BECAUSE MAID OF HONOR

03:32.773 --> 03:34.615
IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF ANY WEDDING, I THINK.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.216
WITH THE SYMBOLISM,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.379
AND THE EXPRESSIONISM,
AND THE CEREMONIALISM,

03:39.379 --> 03:40.420
AND THE DALAI‐LAMA‐ISM.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.942
WHERE'S SHE
GOING WITH THIS?

03:41.942 --> 03:43.143
ONE OF THOSE
WASN'T EVEN A WORD.

03:43.143 --> 03:45.305
I JUST THINK
YOU SHOULD HAVE

03:45.305 --> 03:47.227
A DESIGNATED
MAID OF HONOR.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.630
I WOULD BE A GREAT
MAID OF HONOR.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.032
NO ONE'S EVER ASKED ME.
BUT THEY SHOULD.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.233
BECAUSE I WOULD BE GREAT.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.435
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF,
WHICH I JUST DID.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.037
‐ OH, YOU GOTTA.
‐ YOU DON'T MIND?

03:57.037 --> 03:58.478
LOOK AT THAT FACE.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.041
TRULY,

04:01.041 --> 04:02.843
WILL YOU BE MY
MAID OF HONOR?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.645
YES! REALLY?
I'LL BE A GREAT ONE.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.246
I JUST SAID THAT,
DIDN'T I?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.568
WE NEED MORE CHOCOLATE.

04:07.568 --> 04:09.249
MORE CHOCOLATE
COMING UP.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.411
IS SHE GONNA REMEMBER
SHE ASKED TOMORROW?

04:11.411 --> 04:12.492
VERY IFFY.

04:15.335 --> 04:16.256
‐ SASHA?
‐ AAH!

04:16.256 --> 04:17.257
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.059
I LOCKED THAT
THIS MORNING FOR SURE.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.060
I REMEMBER DOING IT.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.261
DID YOU CALL
THE POLICE?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.422
YES, AFTER BEING
ON HOLD FOR 20 MINUTES

04:22.422 --> 04:23.504
THEY TOLD ME TO
GO IN AND SEE IF

04:23.504 --> 04:24.745
ANYONE'S THERE.

04:24.745 --> 04:26.507
‐ THAT'S STUPID.
‐ I WAS DISAPPOINTED.

04:26.507 --> 04:29.069
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
NOTHING.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.831
I'LL GO IN AND MAKE SURE
IT'S ALL FINE.

04:30.831 --> 04:32.072
I LOCKED THAT DOOR.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.674
‐ I BELIEVE YOU.
‐ BE CAREFUL.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.437
DON'T STEP
ON MY FRUIT!

04:37.437 --> 04:39.279
IT'S AN ORANGE.
WHO CARES?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.681
IT'S A TANGELO.
IT'S ORGANIC,

04:40.681 --> 04:42.082
AND IT COST LIKE
A THOUSAND DOLLARS.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.084
OKAY. I'LL WATCH
THE TANGELOS.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.690
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
‐ I'M COMING WITH.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.851
‐ NO.
‐ I CAN HELP.

04:50.851 --> 04:52.292
‐ I KNOW THE PLACE.
‐ I KNOW THE PLACE TOO.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.453
I KNOW IT BETTER.

04:53.453 --> 04:54.935
IT'S A ONE BEDROOM
APARTMENT.

04:54.935 --> 04:56.176
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU NEED
THE SCHEMATICS OR ANYTHING.

04:56.176 --> 04:58.699
‐ I'M GOING WITH YOU.
‐ FINE.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.701
ANYONE THERE?

05:00.701 --> 05:03.303
IF YOU'RE THERE,
YOU'RE GONNA WISH
YOU WEREN'T.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.666
OH, GOOD. THAT WAS GOOD.
NICE FORCEFUL TONE.

05:07.868 --> 05:11.311
LISTEN, THERE'S
A BASEBALL BAT
UNDER THE COUCH.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.873
I DON'T NEED
A BASEBALL BAT.

05:12.873 --> 05:14.474
AND THERE'S AN UMBRELLA
IN THE LINEN CLOSET.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.476
IT'S GOT PRETTY PONY ON IT,
BUT THE END'S REALLY POINTY.

05:16.476 --> 05:17.477
YOU CAN POKE
HIS EYES OUT.

05:17.477 --> 05:18.879
HELLO?

05:18.879 --> 05:20.320
THERE'S A TENNIS RACKET
BY THE FIREPLACE

05:20.320 --> 05:21.722
AND THERE'S AMMONIA
UNDER THE SINK.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.123
SO WE CAN DISINFECT HIM?

05:23.123 --> 05:25.125
BLIND HIM.
THEN WE'LL OVERTAKE HIM.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.727
UNLESS HE FOUND
THE PRETTY PONY UMBRELLA,

05:26.727 --> 05:28.128
IN WHICH CASE
WE'RE DONE FOR.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
WAS THIS DOOR CLOSED
WHEN YOU LEFT?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.574
YES.

05:33.574 --> 05:35.736
NO.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.339
GET THE PRETTY PONY.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.356
‐ <i>( banging, clanging )</i>
‐ AAH! ROMAN!

06:00.761 --> 06:02.763
THERE IS A VERY LARGE
SPIDER IN THAT BATHROOM.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.444
A SPIDER?

06:04.444 --> 06:06.767
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING
PALEOLITHIC HORROR MOVIE
TYPE STUFF HERE.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.008
WHERE'S MY UMBRELLA?

06:08.008 --> 06:09.169
HE TOOK IT FROM ME.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.371
THIS IS A VERY
SERIOUS SPIDER.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.173
WHAT ABOUT THE BEDROOM?

06:13.173 --> 06:14.775
( exhales )

06:14.775 --> 06:16.176
LET'S CHECK IT.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.106
THERE'S ANOTHER
BASEBALL BAT IN
THE CLOSET

06:26.106 --> 06:27.948
AND THERE'S A CROWBAR
UNDER THE BED.

06:27.948 --> 06:30.190
REMIND ME NEVER TO
MAKE YOU MAD AT ME.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.802
‐ ( sighs )
‐ ANYTHING?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.403
JUST THE CROWBAR.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.645
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

06:44.645 --> 06:46.807
‐ WE'RE GOOD?
‐ WE'RE GOOD.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.609
GOOD.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.211
‐ THANK YOU FOR COMING.
‐ ANYTIME.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.413
I'VE NEVER LEFT
THAT DOOR OPEN.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.055
THAT WAS SO STUPID.

06:55.055 --> 06:56.817
YEAH.
YOU SHOULD WATCH THAT.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.419
I KNOW YOU
COULDN'T TELL,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.221
BUT I WAS SCARED.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.302
I COULD TELL.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.506
YOUR HANDS ARE COLD.

07:05.506 --> 07:06.827
THEY'RE ALWAYS COLD.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.434
WE SHOULD GO CHECK
ON MRS. WEIDEMEYER.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.836
SHE MIGHT BE DEAD.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.437
MRS. WEIDEMEYER'S FINE.

07:25.606 --> 07:27.327
<i>WE'RE HERE!</i>
<i>SASHA, IT'S RUSTY!</i>

07:27.327 --> 07:28.929
<i>‐ AND NANETTE!</i>
<i>‐ THE JORDANS!</i>

07:28.929 --> 07:30.851
RUSTY AND NANETTE JORDAN.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.452
‐ OH, THANK GOD.
‐ ARE YOU OKAY?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.254
WHO IS THIS BOY?
DO WE KNOW THIS BOY?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.696
‐ I DON'T KNOW THIS BOY.
‐ THIS IS ROMAN. HE GOT
HERE FIRST.

07:35.696 --> 07:37.538
‐ DID YOU CHECK
ALL THE ROOMS?
‐ ALL THE CLOSETS?

07:37.538 --> 07:38.859
‐ THE BATHROOMS?
‐ <i>THE CUPBOARDS?</i>

07:38.859 --> 07:40.180
YEAH.
WE CHECKED IT ALL.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.461
‐ <i>OH, THANK GOD.</i>
‐ I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.943
‐ DO WE KNOW THIS BOY?
‐ YEAH, WE KNOW HIM.

07:42.943 --> 07:44.464
‐ OH MY GOD.
‐ SHE'S OKAY.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.866
‐ YOU'RE OKAY?
‐ I'M OKAY.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.467
‐ HI, ROMAN.
‐ HI, BOO.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.869
SO WE KNOW THIS BOY?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.030
YES, WE KNOW THIS BOY.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.471
‐ RUSTY?
‐ <i>I'M DOING A SWEEP.</i>

07:51.471 --> 07:52.553
WE WERE SO WORRIED.

07:52.553 --> 07:54.114
‐ I'M OKAY.
‐ <i>LIVING ROOM'S CLEAR.</i>

07:54.114 --> 07:56.557
<i>‐ I'LL CHECK THE KITCHEN.</i>
<i>‐ I GOT THE KITCHEN.</i>

07:56.557 --> 07:57.558
DID YOU LOOK
UNDER THE BED?

07:57.558 --> 07:58.679
THAT'S WHERE THEY HIDE,
UNDER THE BED.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.240
I CHECKED
UNDER THE BED.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.562
‐ I'M GONNA CHECK THE BATHROOM.
‐ YEAH, CHECK THE BATHROOM.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.043
WHERE'D YOU HAVE
THE SLEDGEHAMMER?

08:03.043 --> 08:04.364
OH, I BROUGHT
THE SLEDGEHAMMER.

08:04.364 --> 08:06.607
Boys: ( yelling )

08:06.607 --> 08:09.009
YOU HAD TO BRING
THE WINKLEBURNS?

08:09.009 --> 08:10.731
IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE
TO LEAVE THEM IN THE CAR.

08:10.731 --> 08:11.972
YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS
A BURGLAR IN HERE.

08:11.972 --> 08:13.053
THAT IS SAFER?

08:13.053 --> 08:14.575
Rusty: <i>OH, GEEZ.</i>
<i>WHAT THE GEEZ!</i>

08:14.575 --> 08:16.577
‐ RUSTY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
‐ <i>IT'S THE BIGGEST SPIDER</i>

08:16.577 --> 08:18.498
<i>I'VE EVER SEEN IN HERE.</i>
<i>IT'S A MONSTER!</i>

08:18.498 --> 08:20.581
‐ WELL, KILL IT!
‐ <i>I TRIED. IT WON'T DIE!</i>

08:20.581 --> 08:22.623
WELL‐‐ BOO, GET
THE WINKLEBURNS.

08:22.623 --> 08:24.705
Rusty:
<i>OH, IT'S LOOKING RIGHT AT ME.</i>

08:24.705 --> 08:26.827
<i>‐ SMASH IT WITH</i>
<i>YOUR SLEDGEHAMMER.</i>
<i>‐ IT TOOK THE SLEDGEHAMMER!</i>

08:26.827 --> 08:29.510
<i>‐ CAN YOU JUMP OUT THE WINDOW?</i>
<i>‐ I CAN'T GET OUT THE WINDOW!</i>

08:29.510 --> 08:30.751
<i>IT'S GOT TEETH!</i>

08:30.751 --> 08:32.913
Michelle:
<i>FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.</i>

08:32.913 --> 08:34.915
<i>( piano playing )</i>

08:38.318 --> 08:39.680
GOOD, GUYS.
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

08:41.081 --> 08:42.523
WHERE ARE YOU SPOTTING?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.324
MICHELLE,
STRAPS OR STRAPLESS?

08:44.324 --> 08:45.926
‐ WHAT?
‐ FOR MY MAID OF HONOR DRESS.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.688
I'M MAKING IT
STRAPS OR STRAPLESS?

08:47.688 --> 08:49.610
I DON'T KNOW.
STRAPS, I GUESS.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.051
LIKE MINDS.

08:51.051 --> 08:52.172
REALLY USE YOUR FEET.

08:52.172 --> 08:53.173
WIDE OR SPAGHETTI?

08:53.173 --> 08:54.535
WIDE. GO WIDE.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.337
WE ARE SIMPATICO.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.699
LAND IN FIFTH,
PLEASE.

08:58.699 --> 09:00.100
TIME TO PICK A FABRIC,
PARTNER.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.942
TRULY, PLEASE.
CLASS ENDS IN 20 MINUTES.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.184
‐ WE'LL TALK THEN.
‐ I HAVE EIGHT HOURS
TO GET THIS MADE.

09:04.184 --> 09:05.706
MY FOCUS RIGHT NOW
IS HERE, OKAY?

09:05.706 --> 09:06.987
FAIR ENOUGH.

09:07.988 --> 09:09.349
Michelle: <i>NICE.</i>

09:09.349 --> 09:11.351
<i>USE YOUR PLIES.</i>

09:11.351 --> 09:13.353
I'M LEANING TOWARDS
THE CRINKLE CHIFFON.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.195
<i>TRULY, ASK TALIA.</i>
<i>SHE'S THE BRIDE.</i>

09:15.195 --> 09:17.037
I DID, BUT I WANT
A SECOND OPINION.

09:17.037 --> 09:18.639
IT'S A DRESS, NOT
A HIP REPLACEMENT.

09:18.639 --> 09:20.320
‐ <i>( whistle blows )</i>
‐ WHAT THE HELL?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.602
<i>‐ UH‐OH.</i>
<i>‐ BASH.</i>

09:21.602 --> 09:22.643
‐ WHAT ZONES?
‐ ZONES? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
ZONES?

09:22.643 --> 09:23.804
ZONE ONE?
I'M ZONE ONE.

09:23.804 --> 09:24.885
‐ I'M THREE.
‐ I'M FOUR.

09:24.885 --> 09:26.046
‐ I'M TWO.
‐ I'M LOST.

09:26.046 --> 09:28.448
THIS IS A FULL AND
IMMEDIATE EVACUATION,

09:28.448 --> 09:30.731
PEOPLE. ZONES
ONE THROUGH FOUR.

09:30.731 --> 09:32.813
( girls murmur )

09:32.813 --> 09:33.974
WHERE'S FANNY?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.095
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:35.095 --> 09:37.057
THE WOODS NORTH OF
THE HIGHWAY ARE ON FIRE.

09:37.057 --> 09:39.299
EVERYONE IN AN EVAC ZONE
NEEDS TO BE IN A SHELTER.

09:39.299 --> 09:41.221
OH, WOW. OKAY.
SO WHERE DO I GO?

09:41.221 --> 09:42.583
YOU'RE ALREADY THERE.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.904
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

09:43.904 --> 09:45.586
THE STUDIO IS ONE
OF TWO DESIGNATED

09:45.586 --> 09:47.588
EVACUATION CENTERS
IN TOWN.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.590
WE'RE THE EAST SIDE EVAC.
THEY'RE THE WEST SIDE.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.712
WAIT, SO PEOPLE
ARE COMING HERE
TO STAY? TO SLEEP?

09:51.712 --> 09:53.193
AND I'M ONE OF
THE ONES IN CHARGE.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.354
THAT'S WHY I'M
WEARING THIS CAP.

09:54.354 --> 09:55.956
‐ THAT SAYS "CAP."
‐ THAT'S RIGHT.

09:55.956 --> 09:57.077
THAT JUST SEEMS SILLY.

09:57.077 --> 09:58.599
CAP STANDS FOR CAPTAIN.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.840
IT IDENTIFIES MY AUTHORITY.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.522
YOU'D BETTER
CATCH UP HERE.

10:01.522 --> 10:03.764
HMM.
YOU'VE GOT A BIG HEAD,

10:03.764 --> 10:05.245
‐ BUT I THINK IT'LL FIT.
‐ THINK WHAT'LL FIT?

10:05.245 --> 10:06.767
THE "CAP" CAP.
IT COMES WITH THE JOB.

10:06.767 --> 10:09.409
WE'LL HAVE TO BROOM OUT
THESE CHAIRS HERE.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.490
WHAT JOB?

10:10.490 --> 10:11.692
WITH FANNY GONE,

10:11.692 --> 10:13.333
YOU ARE THE DESIGNATED
CO‐CAPTAIN

10:13.333 --> 10:14.935
OF THE EAST SIDE
EVACUATION CENTER.

10:14.935 --> 10:16.617
‐ NO. I REFUSE.
‐ YES. YOU CAN'T.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.939
‐ I'M UNQUALIFIED.
‐ SO WAS I, AND LOOK
AT ME NOW.

10:18.939 --> 10:20.100
THE TOWN IS DOOMED.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.022
LISTEN, TIME IS OF
THE ESSENCE HERE.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.704
THERE'S NO ONE
ELSE TO DO THIS.

10:23.704 --> 10:25.185
SO IF YOU CARE
ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY,

10:25.185 --> 10:26.627
PUT THE "CAP" CAP ON.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.273
HEAD'S TOO BIG.

10:40.721 --> 10:42.643
SO ALL THE IMMEDIATE‐NEED
FOOD AND WATER SUPPLIES

10:42.643 --> 10:44.805
WILL BE SET UP AND DISPENSED
ALONG THE SOUTH WALL HERE.

10:44.805 --> 10:45.806
"FOOD AND WATER SUPPLIES."
GOT IT.

10:45.806 --> 10:47.287
‐ DON'T WRITE THAT DOWN.
‐ OKAY.

10:47.287 --> 10:49.209
AND THIS WILL BE LAPTOPS
WITH INTERNET CONNECTIONS

10:49.209 --> 10:50.811
SO PEOPLE CAN KEEP
IN TOUCH WITH LOVED ONES.

10:50.811 --> 10:51.972
"IN TOUCH WITH LOVED ONES."
SWEET.

10:51.972 --> 10:53.814
‐ DON'T WRITE THAT DOWN.
‐ CROSSING IT OFF.

10:53.814 --> 10:55.656
AND OVER THERE IS
OUR MEDICAL AREA.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.578
BANDAGES, IV, ANALGESICS,
ALL THE BASICS.

10:57.578 --> 10:58.939
"ALL THE BASICS."

10:58.939 --> 11:00.901
‐ DON'T WRITE THAT DOWN.
‐ WHY DID YOU GIVE
ME A CLIPBOARD?

11:00.901 --> 11:03.063
MOST OF THE REST OF
THIS SPACE WILL BE
SLEEPING AREAS.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.825
SO YOU AND I WILL
HAVE TO SIT DOWN

11:04.825 --> 11:07.147
AND FIGURE OUT HOW
TO DIVIDE PEOPLE UP.
MAKE A CHART.

11:07.147 --> 11:08.909
DIVIDE THEM UP?
MAKE A CHART? WHY?

11:08.909 --> 11:10.751
OBVIOUSLY FAMILIES
CAN STAY TOGETHER,

11:10.751 --> 11:12.392
BUT THE YOUNG UNMARRIED
SHOULDN'T MIX.

11:12.392 --> 11:14.234
COME ON, BASH,
IT'S ONE BIG OPEN ROOM.

11:14.234 --> 11:15.916
WHAT COULD THEY
POSSIBLY DO?

11:15.916 --> 11:17.237
ORGY.

11:17.237 --> 11:18.919
HAVE THEY ORGIED
IN THE PAST?

11:18.919 --> 11:20.000
THERE'S ALWAYS
A FIRST.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.922
WELL, THIS IS AMERICA,
LAND OF THE FREE.

11:21.922 --> 11:23.844
LET THE PEOPLE CHOOSE
WHERE THEY WANT TO SLEEP.

11:23.844 --> 11:25.846
FINE. YOUR CALL.
FOLLOW ME.

11:27.407 --> 11:29.570
HERE'S OUR SLUSH STORAGE.

11:29.570 --> 11:32.172
AND OF COURSE, SPACE FOR
OUR FOUR‐LEGGED EVACUEES.

11:32.172 --> 11:33.694
CAN YOU BE IN CHARGE
OF THEIR WATER?

11:33.694 --> 11:35.495
‐ I WILL WATER THE ANIMALS.
‐ BETTER WRITE THAT DOWN.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.857
‐ OH, GEEZ.
‐ OH, AND...

11:36.857 --> 11:38.258
I ALMOST FORGOT.
HERE.

11:38.258 --> 11:39.780
A WALKIE‐TALKIE.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.862
SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE.
WE'RE CO‐CAPTAINS,

11:41.862 --> 11:43.263
AND COMMUNICATION
IS VITAL.

11:43.263 --> 11:45.065
‐ OKAY.
‐ SO IT'S IMPORTANT...

11:45.065 --> 11:45.866
‐ FIRE TORPEDOES!
FIRE TORPEDOES!
‐ ...TO USE IT RESPONSIBLY

11:45.866 --> 11:47.107
BECAUSE IT'S
NOT A TOY.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.268
RIGHT.
NOT A TOY.

11:48.268 --> 11:49.510
IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG NIGHT, MICHELLE.

11:49.510 --> 11:50.791
AND I CAN'T
DO THIS ALONE.

11:50.791 --> 11:51.872
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

11:51.872 --> 11:56.276
REALLY BE HERE FOR ME AND
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT...

11:56.276 --> 11:58.278
WE'LL HAVE THIS
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

11:58.278 --> 11:59.720
CHAMPAGNE.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.722
FOR WHEN THE FIRE'S OUT
AND EVERYONE'S OKAY.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.884
DO A GOOD JOB, AND YOU'LL
BE SIPPING IT WITH ME.

12:03.884 --> 12:05.606
I FEEL VERY
INCENTIVIZED.

12:05.606 --> 12:06.887
COME ON.
LET'S GET GOING.

12:10.050 --> 12:11.732

I THINK THAT'S A DOABLE
WORKLOAD FOR YOU.

13:13.273 --> 13:15.115
OH, COME ON.
WHERE'S THE TRUST?

13:15.115 --> 13:16.957

I'M THINKING.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.892

14:51.892 --> 14:53.373
SO, YOU NEVER

14:55.215 --> 14:56.697
THANK YOU,

HEY, EVERYBODY. IS IT COOL
IF MY GIRLFRIEND CUTS IN?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.078

15:23.644 --> 15:24.725
WANDERING AROUND
HERE SOMEWHERE.

15:24.725 --> 15:25.806
JEFF TOBEY.

15:25.806 --> 15:27.007
ALL RIGHT. GOT YOU
DOWN HERE, FRIEND.

15:27.007 --> 15:28.408
I'LL BE YOUR
POINT PERSON TONIGHT.

15:28.408 --> 15:29.810
‐ COOL.
‐ I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING

15:29.810 --> 15:31.091
ALONG THE LINES
OF ENTERTAINMENT,

15:31.091 --> 15:32.292
<i>BUT IF THERE'S</i>
<i>A DVD PLAYER,</i>

15:32.292 --> 15:33.934
I HAVE THE MOST
UNDERRATED MOVIE

15:33.934 --> 15:36.096
OF THE PAST YEAR.
"HOPE SPRINGS."

15:36.096 --> 15:38.939
"HOPE SPRINGS"?
I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.260
YEAH, WHAT'S
NOT TO LOVE?

15:40.260 --> 15:42.102
THE OSCARS SHOULD HAVE
BEEN ALL OVER THAT JOINT.

15:42.102 --> 15:43.103
YES!

15:43.103 --> 15:44.264
AT FIRST I WAS LIKE,

15:44.264 --> 15:45.746
"TWO MIDDLE‐AGED
EMPTY NESTERS

15:45.746 --> 15:48.348
TRYING TO REKINDLE THE SPARK
IN THEIR MARRIAGE? PASS."

15:48.348 --> 15:50.190
BUT WHO KNEW
TOMMY LEE JONES COULD BE

15:50.190 --> 15:51.952
SO TENDER
AND VULNERABLE.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.954
HE KICKED ASS.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.196
WHAT IS THAT THOUGH?
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THE ACTUAL DVD.

15:56.196 --> 15:58.358
IT'S NOT. I'VE GOT A COUSIN
WHO WORKS IN HOLLYWOOD

15:58.358 --> 16:00.961
AND THEY SEND HIM ALL
THESE FREE DVDS AT AWARDS TIME.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.843
WHY EVERY IDIOT WRITER
AND DIRECTOR IN HOLLYWOOD

16:02.843 --> 16:05.445
WANTS TO WATCH A FREE DVD
AND NOT SUPPORT THEIR INDUSTRY,

16:05.445 --> 16:07.447
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT HE BREAKS THE RULES

16:07.447 --> 16:09.369
AND GIVES THEM TO ME.
CHA‐CHING!

16:09.369 --> 16:11.211
"HELL YES, I WANT IT.

16:11.211 --> 16:12.893
YOU BET YOUR LIFE
I WANT IT."

16:12.893 --> 16:14.615
‐ WOW, THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
‐ THANKS.

16:14.615 --> 16:16.977
YEAH, BUT YOU SHOULD HIT
THE "IT" A LITTLE MORE.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.539
"HELL YES, I WANT IT.

16:18.539 --> 16:20.340
YOU BET YOUR LIFE
I WANT IT."

16:20.340 --> 16:22.543
AND YOU SHOULD HIT
THE "HELL YES" HARDER.

16:22.543 --> 16:23.784
LIKE TOMMY DOES.

16:23.784 --> 16:25.385
‐ "HELL YES."
‐ "HELL YES."

16:25.385 --> 16:28.228
‐ "HELL YES."
‐ "HELL YES."

16:28.228 --> 16:30.150
OKAY, COOL.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.872
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

16:31.872 --> 16:33.273
YEAH, SAME HERE.

16:33.273 --> 16:35.996
Talia: <i>MICHELLE?</i>

16:35.996 --> 16:37.397
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
EVERYBODY.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.239
OH HONEY,
YOUR WEDDING.

16:39.239 --> 16:40.561
MY GOD, THE TIMING
OF ALL THIS.

16:40.561 --> 16:42.242
‐ I KNOW.
‐ I WAS TALKING TO TALIA.

16:42.242 --> 16:44.004
SHE'S UPSET TOO.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.006
HAVE YOU TALKED TO RICK?
WE'LL RESCHEDULE, OKAY?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.568
‐ WE'LL DO IT NEXT MONTH?
‐ NEXT MONTH? NO.

16:47.568 --> 16:50.170
‐ WE'RE DOING IT TODAY.
‐ BUT HON, THE FIRE CUTS
US OFF FROM THE BEACH.

16:50.170 --> 16:52.172
I DON'T NEED THE BEACH.
ALL I NEED IS RICK AND
THE MINISTER.

16:52.172 --> 16:54.014
AND YOUR MAID OF HONOR,
AND I AM RIGHT HERE.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.936
‐ WE'RE DOING IT.
‐ Milly: <i>MICHELLE.</i>

16:55.936 --> 16:57.818
‐ <i>LET'S GO. A LOT OF</i>
<i>PEOPLE WAITING HERE.</i>
‐ COMING.

16:57.818 --> 16:59.259
WE'LL THINK
GOOD THOUGHTS.

17:00.741 --> 17:03.023
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
IN LINE BEFORE, MILLY.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.184
YOU DIDN'T CUT IN,
DID YOU?

17:04.184 --> 17:06.547
‐ NO. I WAS HERE.
‐ REALLY?

17:06.547 --> 17:08.348
ANYONE CLAIMING
I CUT IN?

17:08.348 --> 17:09.750
ANYONE?

17:12.593 --> 17:15.035
AND NOTE THAT THE GROUP
SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED BEING

17:15.035 --> 17:16.316
WISHED INTO THE CORNFIELD.

17:16.316 --> 17:18.759
WHY DOES EVERYONE MAKE THAT SAME
CORNFIELD REFERENCE ABOUT ME?

17:18.759 --> 17:20.921
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
YOU CHECKED IN, MILLY.
IT'S JUST YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER?

17:20.921 --> 17:22.683
MY DAUGHTER'S AT
THE OTHER EVAC CENTER.

17:22.683 --> 17:25.205
‐ SERIOUSLY?
‐ TUESDAYS ARE MY NIGHT
OFF FROM THE KID.

17:25.205 --> 17:27.167
TONIGHT'S TUESDAY.
SHE'S WITH A NANNY.

17:27.167 --> 17:28.969
‐ OKAY.
‐ SHE'S GOT TOYS.

17:28.969 --> 17:32.212
EVERYBODY, MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

17:32.212 --> 17:35.335
I REALLY NEED
A YOUNG BOY.

17:35.335 --> 17:38.218
OR GIRL TO VOLUNTEER
FOR SOME HEAVY LIFTING.

17:38.218 --> 17:40.621
I INCLUDE BOTH SEXES
BECAUSE IN THE PAST,

17:40.621 --> 17:42.222
MY SAYING I NEED
A YOUNG BOY

17:42.222 --> 17:43.864
LED TO A LOT OF
MISUNDERSTANDINGS.

17:43.864 --> 17:46.066
SO I'M INCLUDING
YOU LADIES AS WELL.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.309
YOU JUST NEED STRONG BACKS
AND TONED THIGHS.

17:49.309 --> 17:51.632
IF YOU FIT THE BILL,
PLEASE COME SEE ME.

17:51.632 --> 17:53.073
TO BE CLEAR,

17:53.073 --> 17:55.235
I LIKE MEN AND WOMEN
EQUALLY.

17:55.235 --> 17:57.077
BOTH SEXES WORK FOR ME.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.963
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GONNA LEAD TO
ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS AT ALL.

18:02.963 --> 18:06.086
VOLUNTEERS. I NEED
TWO MORE VOLUNTEERS.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.487
YOU GUYS FEELINGS
STRONG TODAY?

18:07.487 --> 18:09.129
NOPE.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.252
YOU'RE DANCERS. YOU HAVE
TONED THIGHS AND NO EXCUSE.

18:12.252 --> 18:13.774
I'LL VOLUNTEER.

18:13.774 --> 18:15.495
Bash: <i>YOU'LL HAVE TO</i>
<i>WEAR THE T‐SHIRT.</i>

18:15.495 --> 18:16.617
Frankie:
<i>I'LL WEAR THE T‐SHIRT.</i>

18:16.617 --> 18:18.018
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FIGHT ME ON THE T‐SHIRT?

18:18.018 --> 18:19.820
‐ I LIKE THE T‐SHIRT.
‐ NO ONE LIKES THE T‐SHIRT.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.101
I'LL WEAR THE T‐SHIRT.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.663
YOU CAN CHANGE BEHIND
THAT PRIVACY SCREEN.

18:47.568 --> 18:48.889
HELLO, LADIES.

18:48.889 --> 18:50.731
‐ HELLO, GIRLFRIEND.
‐ HELLO, BOYFRIEND.

18:50.731 --> 18:52.573
WHERE ARE YOU
SETTING UP?

18:52.573 --> 18:53.814
I WAS THINKING HERE.

18:53.814 --> 18:55.335
‐ IS THAT ALLOWED?
‐ NOT BY ME.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.737
WORD IS THE RULES
ARE LOOSE.

18:56.737 --> 18:57.898
COOL.

18:57.898 --> 18:59.179
HEY, GUYS.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.981
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT A FUN
LITTLE PARTY GOING ON.

19:00.981 --> 19:02.382
WE DID,
PAST TENSE.

19:02.382 --> 19:03.584
OKAY IF I CAMP OUT HERE?

19:03.584 --> 19:05.425
KINDA GOT STUCK IN
PARENTS LAND WHERE I AM,

19:05.425 --> 19:06.827
AND THE OTHER YOUTH SECTION
IS FULL OF JOCKS

19:06.827 --> 19:07.908
AND I'M KIND OF
FOOD FOR THEM.

19:07.908 --> 19:09.189
SURE, WHY NOT?

19:09.189 --> 19:10.831
PULL UP A COT, JEFF.

19:10.831 --> 19:12.192
YEAH, WHY NOT?
ANY FAN OF "HOPE SPRINGS"

19:12.192 --> 19:13.754
IS A FRIEND OF MINE.

19:13.754 --> 19:14.995
OH, NOT YOU TOO.

19:14.995 --> 19:17.197
CARL HAS MADE ME
SEE THAT MOVIE THREE TIMES.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.679
YOU KNEW I WAS
INTO THAT MOVIE, BOO.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.841
‐ I DID?
‐ I'VE DONE MY
TOMMY LEE JONES

19:20.841 --> 19:22.202
FOR YOU
A MILLION TIMES.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.204
"I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."

19:24.204 --> 19:25.365
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.847
IT SHOULD GO A LITTLE
FASTER THOUGH.

19:26.847 --> 19:28.208
TOMMY'S PACE
IS ALWAYS BRISK.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.450
‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."
‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."

19:30.450 --> 19:31.932
‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."
‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."

19:31.932 --> 19:33.774
‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."
‐ OKAY, WELL...

19:33.774 --> 19:35.856
YOU KNOW, NOW YOU'RE
KIND OF SOUNDING LIKE
GRANDPA SIMPSON

19:35.856 --> 19:38.498
AND TOMMY LEE JONES DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE GRANDPA SIMPSON.

19:38.498 --> 19:40.260
OKAY, GUYS.
EVERYBODY POSE.

19:42.783 --> 19:44.384
YOU SHOULD
TAKE THAT AGAIN.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.026
MM, I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE IT AGAIN.

19:46.026 --> 19:48.629
YOU USED THE FLASH.
NOTHING LOOKS GOOD
WITH A FLASH.

19:48.629 --> 19:49.710
YOU'RE WRONG.

19:49.710 --> 19:50.791
ADAMS NEVER
USED A FLASH.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.032
ADAMS WHO?

19:52.032 --> 19:54.635
‐ ANSEL ADAMS.
‐ YOU KNOW ANSEL ADAMS?

19:54.635 --> 19:56.116
YEAH, HE'S NO
CARTIER‐BRESSON,

19:56.116 --> 19:58.759
BUT HE'S OKAY.

19:58.759 --> 20:00.480
Jeff: <i>...DROVE BY IT</i>
<i>ON A FAMILY TRIP ONCE,</i>
<i>GOT A PICTURE.</i>

20:00.480 --> 20:02.322
YOU'VE GOT A PICTURE OF
TOMMY LEE JONES'S RANCH?

20:02.322 --> 20:03.403
I BLEW IT UP INTO
AN 8 x 10.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.965
IT'S HANGING
OVER MY BED.

20:04.965 --> 20:06.326
<i>I'VE SEEN THE ARCHITECTURAL</i>
<i>DIGEST PIECE ON IT,</i>

20:06.326 --> 20:08.408
<i>BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT</i>
<i>IN PERSON. IS IT COOL?</i>

20:08.408 --> 20:11.251
Jeff: <i>IT'S OWNED</i>
<i>BY TOMMY LEE JONES.</i>
<i>IT'S COOLNESS GUARANTEED.</i>

20:11.251 --> 20:12.773
‐ Carl: <i>YOU SURE IT'S IN TEXAS?</i>
‐ Jeff: <i>POSITIVE.</i>

20:12.773 --> 20:14.815
<i>‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."</i>
<i>‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."</i>

20:14.815 --> 20:17.257
<i>‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."</i>
<i>‐ "I LIKE RANCH CHIPS."</i>

20:17.257 --> 20:19.259
DROOL CUP.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:22.823 --> 20:24.505
OH, TRULY, GOOD.
IT'S JUST YOU.

20:24.505 --> 20:26.146
I WAS FEELING VERY
CLAUSTROPHOBIC OUT THERE.

20:26.146 --> 20:28.268
YES.
THIS IS MY PREP ROOM
UNTIL A COUPLE HOURS

20:28.268 --> 20:30.270
BEFORE THE CEREMONY,
AND THEN IT'S TALIA'S
DRESSING ROOM.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.912
I'VE GOT IT ALL
FIGURED OUT. LOOK.

20:31.912 --> 20:33.674
GOD, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:33.674 --> 20:35.836
‐ IT'S MY MAID OF HONOR
MUSLIN MOCK‐UP DRESS.
‐ YOUR‐‐?

20:35.836 --> 20:37.998
YOU NEVER WANT TO EXPERIMENT
ON THE ACTUAL FABRIC,

20:37.998 --> 20:40.280
SO YOU DO A MOCK‐UP
IN MUSLIN WHICH I DO NOT HAVE.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.281
‐ SO I‐‐
‐ CUT UP A COT.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.523
I CUT UP A COT.

20:42.523 --> 20:44.685
WELL, THE SHAPE
IS BEAUTIFUL. OW.

20:44.685 --> 20:46.607
IT'S A HYBRID.
BEYONCE IN FRONT,

20:46.607 --> 20:47.688
PIPPA MIDDLETON
IN BACK,

20:47.688 --> 20:48.889
AND EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
ON THE SIDE.

20:48.889 --> 20:50.931
<i>HEY, CHECK OUT TRULY'S</i>

20:50.931 --> 20:53.293
PIPPA‐BEYONCE‐
EDWARD SCISSORHANDS‐
COT DRESS.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.615
NO POINT.
RICK IS STUCK.

20:54.615 --> 20:55.856
HE CAN'T GET PAST
THE CHECK POINT.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.858
OH NO.
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

20:57.858 --> 20:59.860
I'M SO SORRY.
YOU MUST FEEL AWFUL.

20:59.860 --> 21:01.461
AWFUL AND DEVASTATED.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.143
I MEANT TALIA, TRULY.

21:03.143 --> 21:04.545
LOOK, GIRLS,
WE TRIED.

21:04.545 --> 21:06.026
BUT THE GODS
WERE AGAINST US.

21:06.026 --> 21:08.188
NO.
THE GODS HAVE NOT
DECIDED THIS YET.

21:08.188 --> 21:10.470
THE GODS NEED TO GIVE ME
MORE TIME TO THINK.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.112
HEY, GUYS.
QUICK QUESTION,

21:12.112 --> 21:13.714
CAN I SET UP
MY CREPE STATION IN HERE?

21:13.714 --> 21:15.435
‐ YOUR‐‐?
‐ <i>IT'S CREPE NIGHT FOR ME</i>

21:15.435 --> 21:16.757
AND I'M PAYING HER ANYWAY,

21:16.757 --> 21:18.278
SO I THOUGHT I'D GET HELGA
ROCKING ON SOME CREPES.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.120
MILLY, THIS IS AN
EVACUATION CENTER.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.082
PEOPLE DOWN THERE ARE
EATING COLD RATIONS.

21:22.082 --> 21:23.483
WHOA, WRONG IMPRESSION.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.485
THERE IS ENOUGH FOR
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.687
SWEET OR SAVORY,
CALL IT OUT.

21:26.687 --> 21:28.208
MILLY, WE ARE IN
CRISIS MODE HERE.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.490
OUR WEDDING IS
MISSING ITS GROOM.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.893
SURE, I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.
BACK IT UP, HELGA.

21:32.893 --> 21:36.016
TRULY, I KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANT TO YOU.

21:36.016 --> 21:36.897
NO, YOU DON'T.

21:36.897 --> 21:38.739
YOU REALLY DON'T.
THIS IS IT.

21:38.739 --> 21:40.340
THIS WILL NEVER
HAPPEN TO ME AGAIN.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.662
NO ONE WILL EVER
ASK ME AGAIN.

21:41.662 --> 21:42.743
AND I HAD THIS
BEAUTIFUL DRESS,

21:42.743 --> 21:43.824
AND ALL THESE THINGS
I WANT TO DO.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.666
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

21:45.666 --> 21:46.907
NO!

21:46.907 --> 21:48.749
THIS WEDDING IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

21:48.749 --> 21:49.910
WE WILL FIND A WAY.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.151
TRULY.

22:26.066 --> 22:27.908
<i>Michelle, it's Bash.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

22:27.908 --> 22:29.670
HEY, BASH. SURE.
I'M DOWN BY THE FOOD.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.231
‐ I KNOW.
‐ GEEZ. DON'T DO THAT.

22:31.231 --> 22:33.073
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
LOOK.

22:33.073 --> 22:35.756
‐ <i>( cheering )</i>
‐ WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

22:35.756 --> 22:37.758
‐ A JUGGLER.
‐ WOW, HE'S GOOD.

22:37.758 --> 22:39.079
WHAT IS THIS?
LIKE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL?

22:39.079 --> 22:41.522
IT'S THE ENTERTAINMENT
AT THE WEST SIDE
EVACUATION CENTER.

22:41.522 --> 22:43.764
‐ ARE YOU KIDDING?
‐ I HAVE A MOLE DOWN THERE
SENDING ME FOOTAGE.

22:43.764 --> 22:44.925
CHECK THIS OUT.

22:44.925 --> 22:46.927
<i>( singing )</i>

22:46.927 --> 22:48.929
THEY'RE SINGING
"THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER."

22:48.929 --> 22:50.090
WHAT ARE THOSE WORDS?

22:50.090 --> 22:51.932
THE SUPER OBSCURE
SECOND VERSE.

22:51.932 --> 22:53.093
THAT'S HARDCORE.

22:53.093 --> 22:54.935
AND AFTER DINNER,
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

22:54.935 --> 22:56.256
<i>( music playing, cheering )</i>

22:56.256 --> 22:58.098
‐ A CONGA LINE.
‐ WE SUCK.

22:58.098 --> 23:00.380
WE NEED TO FEED AND
ENTERTAIN THESE PEOPLE

23:00.380 --> 23:02.102
‐ BEFORE THEY TURN ON US.
‐ I'M WITH YOU.

23:02.102 --> 23:04.104
I'LL SPEED UP THE FOOD
AND I'LL HAVE MY KIDS
WORK UP SOMETHING.

23:04.104 --> 23:06.186
I SPENT A FEW YEARS ON
THE FRINGE FESTIVAL CIRCUIT.

24:48.649 --> 24:51.371
TRULY, THERE'S NO GROOM.
WHY ARE YOU STILL WORKING
ON YOUR DRESS?

24:51.371 --> 24:53.213
THE POWER OF
POSITIVE THINKING.

24:53.213 --> 24:55.215
IF I WILL IT,
IT WILL BE SO.

24:55.215 --> 24:56.657
SO I SEW.

NO, TRULY.
I FOUND A CONDOM

25:07.908 --> 25:09.229
UNDER ONE OF
THESE LOCKERS.

25:09.229 --> 25:10.390
‐ REALLY?
‐ YEAH.

25:10.390 --> 25:11.832
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHOSE IT IS

25:11.832 --> 25:13.393
OR IF THERE'S
MORE OF THEM.

25:13.393 --> 25:14.675
WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF
PEOPLE COMING THROUGH
HERE RIGHT NOW.

25:14.675 --> 25:16.316
YEAH, I GUESS.
ALTHOUGH IT WAS SHOVED

25:16.316 --> 25:18.158
BACK THERE PRETTY GOOD.
LIKE IT HAD BEEN THERE A WHILE.

25:18.158 --> 25:20.240
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT
ONE OF THE BUNHEADS DOWN
THERE IS HAVING SEX.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.683
‐ OR THEY ALL COULD BE.
‐ NO. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

25:22.683 --> 25:23.844
‐ SURE IT IS.
‐ THEY'RE TOO YOUNG.

25:23.844 --> 25:25.205
‐ NOT ALL OF THEM.

YES.

25:30.691 --> 25:32.252
HOW, TALIA?
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

25:32.252 --> 25:34.254
SOME GOOD SAMARITAN
HEARD WHAT WAS HAPPENING

25:34.254 --> 25:36.096
AND SENT A HELICOPTER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

25:36.096 --> 25:37.698
CLEARED IT WITH
THE AUTHORITIES
AND EVERYTHING.

25:37.698 --> 25:39.419

BILLY ELLIOT

25:58.118 --> 25:59.119

25:59.119 --> 26:00.641
BILLY ELLIOT IS
ALREADY A SHOW.

26:00.641 --> 26:01.882
OURS WASN'T ABOUT BILLY.

26:01.882 --> 26:03.804
IT WAS ABOUT BILLY'S
COAL MINER FATHER.

26:03.804 --> 26:05.045
WE ALL GOT BLACK LUNG

26:05.045 --> 26:06.286
Bash:
<i>Michelle, are you around?</i>

UP AND RUNNING.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.975
IT'S A LITTLE CRUDE,

YOU'RE GETTING A MASSAGE
WITH ALL THAT'S GOING ON?

29:38.378 --> 29:39.860
IT'S NOT FOR PLEASURE.

29:39.860 --> 29:42.022
IT'S FOR MY PHYSICAL THERAPY

MOM'S REALLY ITCHING
FOR ONE OF US TO HAVE ONE.

30:34.515 --> 30:36.476
WELL, SHE SHOULD
GIVE UP ON ME.

30:36.476 --> 30:38.919
IT'S NOT IN THE CARDS.

30:38.919 --> 30:40.921
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
A HUSBAND WAS

30:40.921 --> 30:43.083
WHAT WAS MISSING
FROM MY LIFE, YOU KNOW?

30:43.083 --> 30:45.485
BUT I WASN'T
MEETING ANYBODY,

30:45.485 --> 30:47.487
AND I WANTED A BABY,

30:47.487 --> 30:49.089
SO I HAD MY
LITTLE CHING LAN

30:49.089 --> 30:50.410
SHIPPED OVER
FROM CHINA,

30:50.410 --> 30:51.972

30:56.096 --> 30:58.498
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO PUT HER DOWN.

30:58.498 --> 31:00.500
AND I REALIZED,

31:00.500 --> 31:03.103
SHE'S ALL
I'LL EVER NEED.

31:03.103 --> 31:05.105
WELL, I'M NOT GIVING UP.

31:05.105 --> 31:07.027
I'M GETTING MARRIED

NO.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.361
‐ HEY.
‐ YEAH?

31:21.361 --> 31:23.203
‐ CAN YOU HELP ME OUTSIDE?
‐ YEAH, SURE.

32:00.561 --> 32:02.002
IT WAS ON THE GROUND,
SO I PICKED IT UP.

32:05.005 --> 32:06.166
YOU WERE SNIFFING IT.

32:06.166 --> 32:07.568
I WAS STIFLING A YAWN.

32:07.568 --> 32:09.570
WITH HIS JACKET?
PATHETIC.

32:09.570 --> 32:11.572
‐ EXCUSE ME.
‐ NO, WAIT.

32:11.572 --> 32:14.014
LET ME TELL YOU
A STORY.

32:14.014 --> 32:18.178
LAST YEAR, MY FAMILY
WENT ON THIS PRIVATE
SAFARI.

32:18.178 --> 32:21.181
MY PARENTS, FRANKIE‐‐
IT'S SUNSET...

32:21.181 --> 32:23.023
AND WE'RE WALKING
DOWN THIS TRAIL.

32:23.023 --> 32:25.586
GOLDEN SKIES,
BEAUTIFUL VISTAS,

32:25.586 --> 32:29.429
AND WE SEE THIS
LITTLE BABY ANTELOPE
ON THE HORIZON.

32:29.429 --> 32:30.711
YEAH?

32:30.711 --> 32:33.594
WE GET CLOSER,
AND IT TURNS ITS
HEAD TO LOOK AT US.

32:33.594 --> 32:36.196
AND THE GUIDE SAYS,
"TURN AWAY.

32:36.196 --> 32:38.198
A LION'S HAD AT IT."

32:38.198 --> 32:39.600
I DON'T GET IT.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.201
IT HAD BEEN HALF
EATEN BY A LION.

32:41.201 --> 32:42.603
OH MY GOD.

32:42.603 --> 32:43.604
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

32:43.604 --> 32:45.365
EVERYBODY FROZE,
AND I THOUGHT

32:45.365 --> 32:47.207
"IT'S WRONG TO
TURN MY BACK

32:47.207 --> 32:48.609
AND LET THIS
POOR LITTLE THING

32:48.609 --> 32:50.450
JUST SIT THERE
AND BLEED OUT

32:50.450 --> 32:53.053
LIKE JUDI DENCH IN
THAT JAMES BOND MOVIE."

32:53.053 --> 32:55.415
SO I GRABBED A GUN
AND SHOT IT IN THE HEAD.

32:55.415 --> 32:58.138
YOU BLEW A BABY
ANTELOPE'S HEAD OFF?

32:58.138 --> 32:59.540
PUT IT RIGHT
OUT OF ITS MISERY.

32:59.540 --> 33:02.382
AND YOU, MY DEAR,

33:02.382 --> 33:05.025
ARE A HALF‐EATEN
BABY ANTELOPE.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.227
AND YOU'RE GONNA
SHOOT MY HEAD OFF?

33:07.227 --> 33:10.631
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME,
FINE. I'M COOL.

33:10.631 --> 33:12.312
BUT I HAVE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING

33:12.312 --> 33:13.634
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
TOO SAD TO LOOK AT YOU

33:13.634 --> 33:15.235
AND I JUST CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

33:26.246 --> 33:28.088
LET ME GUESS‐‐
YOU'RE EXCITED, NERVOUS,

33:28.088 --> 33:29.409
HAPPY AND NAUSEOUS
ALL AT ONCE?

33:29.409 --> 33:31.411
ALL FOUR EQUALLY.
SUCH A BIG DAY.

33:31.411 --> 33:32.813
OKAY, I WAS TALKING TO
THE BRIDE‐TO‐BE HERE.

33:32.813 --> 33:35.415
RIGHT. I'M SURE SHE
HAS SIMILAR FEELINGS.

33:35.415 --> 33:37.257
DID I GO TOO TRAMPY
ON THE DRESS?

33:37.257 --> 33:39.660
‐ OKAY. TURN AROUND FOR ME.
‐ I WAS SHOOTING FOR MARILYN

33:39.660 --> 33:41.341
SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO KENNEDY,

33:41.341 --> 33:42.422
BUT WITH UNDERWEAR.

33:42.422 --> 33:44.665
‐ YOU LOOK PERFECT.
‐ THANKS.

33:44.665 --> 33:46.106
‐ <i>( phone buzzes )</i>
‐ OH NO.

33:46.106 --> 33:47.668
WHAT?

33:47.668 --> 33:49.269
‐ NO.
‐ WHAT IS IT?

33:49.269 --> 33:51.111
IT'S RICK.
HE WAS GETTING
OUT OF THE CAR

33:51.111 --> 33:52.272
AND HE TRIPPED
AND BROKE HIS ANKLE

33:52.272 --> 33:53.954
AND HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
IT NEVER STOPS.

33:53.954 --> 33:55.435
A BROKEN ANKLE
IS NOTHING.

33:55.435 --> 33:57.518
NO, A BROKEN ANKLE
MEANS HE'S IN A CAST
AND IN PAIN

33:57.518 --> 33:59.279
WHICH MEANS HE'S NOT
WALKING DOWN THE AISLE.

33:59.279 --> 34:02.282
‐ THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
‐ OKAY, SO HE CAN'T WALK
DOWN THE AISLE.

34:02.282 --> 34:03.684
WE CAN WHEEL HIM
DOWN THE AISLE,

34:03.684 --> 34:05.285
OR YOU CAN GET MARRIED
AT HIS BEDSIDE.

34:05.285 --> 34:06.607
THAT'S A FUN
WEDDING STORY.

34:06.607 --> 34:08.128
I DON'T WANT TO GET
MARRIED IN A HOSPITAL.

34:08.128 --> 34:09.449
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A DRESS
THAT YOU'D WEAR

34:09.449 --> 34:10.490
TO GET MARRIED
IN A HOSPITAL?

34:10.490 --> 34:11.532
WELL, IN A HOSPITAL
IN PARTS

34:11.532 --> 34:12.933
OF SAN FRANCISCO
PERHAPS.

34:12.933 --> 34:14.294
OR EAST VILLAGE.
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

34:14.294 --> 34:15.696
‐ CHICKIE.
‐ RICK'S BOOKIE?

34:15.696 --> 34:17.217
HIS BEST MAN.

34:17.217 --> 34:19.139
DAMN IT!
WHY ISN'T HE ANSWERING?

34:19.139 --> 34:20.300
WELL, MAYBE HE CAN'T
HEAR THE PHONE.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.782
NOT BECAUSE
HE'S OLD AND DEAF,

34:21.782 --> 34:24.064
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LET YOU
USE PHONES IN HOSPITALS.

34:24.064 --> 34:25.546
AND HE'S PROBABLY
OLD AND DEAF.

34:25.546 --> 34:26.867
OKAY, LOOK.

34:26.867 --> 34:29.149
MAYBE IN A SUPER WEIRD WAY
THIS IS A BLESSING.

34:29.149 --> 34:30.711
HOW?

34:30.711 --> 34:32.312
IT GIVES YOU
TIME TO THINK.

34:32.312 --> 34:34.394
‐ ABOUT WHAT?
‐ ABOUT THIS.

34:34.394 --> 34:35.876
‐ MARRYING RICK?
‐ YEAH.

34:35.876 --> 34:37.157
I DON'T NEED TO THINK
ABOUT MARRYING RICK.

34:37.157 --> 34:38.358
I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT
ABOUT MARRYING RICK.

34:38.358 --> 34:39.800
I KNOW YOU'RE
TIRED OF VEGAS

34:39.800 --> 34:40.881
AND THE SHOW
YOU'RE IN,

34:40.881 --> 34:42.482
AND YOUR LIFE,
AND I COMPLETELY
GET THAT.

34:42.482 --> 34:44.965
BUT MAYBE THIS ISN'T
THE ANSWER, YOU KNOW?

34:44.965 --> 34:46.406
YOU DON'T THINK I SHOULD
MARRY HIM, DO YOU?

34:46.406 --> 34:49.249
NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD MARRY HIM.

34:49.249 --> 34:51.732
‐ WHY?
‐ HE'S...

34:51.732 --> 34:52.773
NOT CATHOLIC.

34:52.773 --> 34:54.374
JUST STOP, MICHELLE, OKAY?

34:54.374 --> 34:57.858
I MEAN, ALL THIS JUST BECAUSE
RICKY TRIPPED AND FELL?
EVERYBODY FALLS.

34:57.858 --> 34:59.820
I WATCHED YOU FALL FROM
THE TOP OF AN ESCALATOR

34:59.820 --> 35:01.622
<i>AT A MALL IN VEGAS</i>
<i>ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM,</i>

35:01.622 --> 35:03.864
AND YOU BOUNCED BACK UP
AND RIGHT INTO NEIMAN'S.

35:03.864 --> 35:05.105
RICK LOVES ME.

35:05.105 --> 35:06.667
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

35:06.667 --> 35:08.789
YOU'RE TALIA.
YOU'RE GREAT.

35:08.789 --> 35:10.110
BUT YOU DON'T THINK
I LOVE HIM?

35:10.110 --> 35:11.592
NO.

35:11.592 --> 35:14.354
BECAUSE YOU'RE TWISTING
YOURSELF INTO A PRETZEL
FOR HIM.

35:14.354 --> 35:16.917
WITH THE CRAFTING
AND WANTING TO COOK

35:16.917 --> 35:19.439
AND WANTING A YAPPY
LITTLE PEKINGESE.
THAT'S NOT YOU.

35:19.439 --> 35:20.360
PEKINGESE AREN'T YAPPY.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.842
YEAH, THEY'RE
SUPER YAPPY.

35:21.842 --> 35:23.363
‐ THEY'RE REGAL.
‐ NO, THEY'RE NOT AT ALL REGAL.

35:23.363 --> 35:25.445
‐ BIG REGAL DOG.
‐ SMALL YAPPY SMOKE ALARMS.

35:25.445 --> 35:26.446
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS.

35:26.446 --> 35:29.369
YOU ARE TURNING DOWN
OFFERS FOR LEGIT SHOWS

35:29.369 --> 35:31.211
TO BE WITH HIM.
SHOWS THAT COULD
GO TO NEW YORK.

35:31.211 --> 35:33.373
‐ WHO DOES THAT?
‐ ME. I DO IT.

35:33.373 --> 35:35.015
I TOLD YOU,
THAT'S YOUR THING.

35:35.015 --> 35:36.296
YOU WANT TO GO BE IN
A SHOW IN NEW YORK,

35:36.296 --> 35:37.457
GO BE IN A SHOW
IN NEW YORK.

35:37.457 --> 35:38.619
I WANT TO GET MARRIED.

35:38.619 --> 35:40.861
IS THIS WHY YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO BE MY MAID OF HONOR?

35:40.861 --> 35:42.262
BECAUSE YOU THINK
THE MARRIAGE IS DOOMED?

35:42.262 --> 35:43.744
IT JUST DOESN'T
FEEL REAL TO ME.

35:43.744 --> 35:44.985
I'M PREGNANT!

35:46.386 --> 35:47.387
PRETTY REAL, HUH?

35:49.389 --> 35:51.391
OKAY.

35:51.391 --> 35:53.233
WE'LL MAKE THIS WORK.

35:53.233 --> 35:55.235
I'LL RAISE
THE BABY WITH YOU.

35:55.235 --> 35:57.037
IT'LL BE TOUGH,
BUT WE'LL MAKE IT FUN.

35:57.037 --> 35:58.879
LIKE A SITCOM.
IT'LL BE "TWO BROKE
GIRLS AND A BABY."

35:58.879 --> 36:00.040
IT'LL BE GREAT.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.562
YOU AND I AREN'T
DOING ANYTHING.

36:01.562 --> 36:02.803
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

36:02.803 --> 36:05.245
YOU DO WHATEVER.

36:05.245 --> 36:06.687
YEAH.

36:11.932 --> 36:12.933
<i>OKAY, GUYS.</i>
<i>SAY CHEESE.</i>

36:12.933 --> 36:14.214
All: CHEESE.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.617
CUTE.

36:16.617 --> 36:18.539
THAT'S GONNA LOOK GREAT
WITHOUT THE FLASH.

36:18.539 --> 36:19.700
GLAD YOU TOOK ME
UP ON THAT.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.781
( clears throat )

36:24.545 --> 36:27.387
HI, GUYS.
YOU COPING OKAY?

36:27.387 --> 36:28.949
I HAD A DOG.

36:28.949 --> 36:30.030
CALVIN.

36:30.030 --> 36:32.713
DAD NAMED HIM AFTER
SOME CARTOON GUY.

36:32.713 --> 36:34.234
"CALVIN AND HOBBES"?

36:34.234 --> 36:36.396
NO. HIS NAME
WAS JUST CALVIN.

36:36.396 --> 36:38.959
I USED TO TALK IN HIS VOICE
LIKE HE WAS THE ONE TALKING.

36:38.959 --> 36:40.561
CRACKED EVERYBODY UP.

36:40.561 --> 36:42.883
YES, YOU ARE A REGULAR
LOUIS C. K.

36:42.883 --> 36:45.966
I MISS HIM.
HE WAS A COOL DOG.

36:45.966 --> 36:47.568
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

36:47.568 --> 36:49.409
CAR HIT HIM.

36:49.409 --> 36:50.971
YEAH. YOU KNOW.

36:50.971 --> 36:53.253
WHATEVER.

36:53.253 --> 36:54.494
SO I GUESS GINNY
AND YOUR BROTHER'S

36:54.494 --> 36:55.576
NOT HAPPENING,
HUH?

36:55.576 --> 36:56.977
NOT FOR LIKE YEARS.

36:56.977 --> 36:58.418
WHAT HAPPENED?

36:58.418 --> 36:59.700
SHE'S INTO SOMEONE ELSE.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.702
WHY? CHARLIE'S COOL.

37:01.702 --> 37:02.983
IT WASN'T SO MUCH WHY,

37:02.983 --> 37:04.264
IT WAS THE WHY NOTS.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.746
AND SHE LIKES
THIS OTHER GUY.

37:05.746 --> 37:07.548
HUH.

37:07.548 --> 37:10.070
KINDA THOUGHT FOR A WHILE
THERE'D BE A DOUBLE‐DATE
THING OR SOMETHING.

37:10.070 --> 37:11.552
YOU MEAN YOU AND ME?

37:11.552 --> 37:12.753
YEAH.

37:12.753 --> 37:13.914
NO.

37:13.914 --> 37:16.557
‐ WHY NOT?
‐ BECAUSE.

37:16.557 --> 37:18.999
MY MOM SAYS
BECAUSE IS A WORD,

37:18.999 --> 37:20.120
NOT A REASON.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.683
WELL, THAT'S THE REASON.

37:22.683 --> 37:24.004
BECAUSE, OKAY?

37:24.004 --> 37:25.165
BECAUSE.

37:25.165 --> 37:27.768
SO YOU CAN'T THINK
OF A REASON WHY?

37:27.768 --> 37:29.890
I DON'T KNOW.

37:29.890 --> 37:32.012
IF YOU CAN'T THINK
OF A REASON WHY,

37:32.012 --> 37:35.375
CAN YOU THINK OF
A REASON WHY NOT?

37:38.619 --> 37:39.980
NOT OFFHAND.

37:39.980 --> 37:44.545
THEN WHY NOT?

37:54.034 --> 37:55.636
HEY, BRIDE.

37:55.636 --> 37:57.638
LOOK.
IT'S A PEKINGESE.

37:57.638 --> 37:59.800
RICK BROUGHT HIM.
ONE OF MY WEDDING GIFTS.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.642
‐ OH.
‐ YOU WERE RIGHT.

38:01.642 --> 38:03.403
I WAS THINKING
OF ANOTHER DOG.

38:03.403 --> 38:04.725
YEAH, BUT THIS
ONE'S GOOD TOO.

38:04.725 --> 38:06.326
AND IN A PINCH
YOU CAN DUST WITH IT.

38:06.326 --> 38:07.728
I GUESS.

38:07.728 --> 38:08.809
HEY, HE'S ADORABLE.

38:08.809 --> 38:11.011
YEAH.
HE KIND OF IS.

38:12.653 --> 38:13.854
YOU STILL WANT ME
IN YOUR WEDDING?

38:13.854 --> 38:16.657
YOU'RE TECHNICALLY
NOT IN THE WEDDING.

38:16.657 --> 38:18.498
WOULD YOU TAKE HIM
A SECOND?

38:18.498 --> 38:19.860
OH.

38:21.662 --> 38:22.983
YES, YOU'RE IN
THE WEDDING.

38:22.983 --> 38:24.144
AFTER ALL THAT
STUFF I SAID?

38:24.144 --> 38:25.666
YOU SAID IT BECAUSE
YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.

38:25.666 --> 38:27.067
AND THERE'S
EVERY REASON TO.

38:27.067 --> 38:29.670
LOOK AT HIM.
HE IS OLD.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.071
OLDER.
NOT OLD.

38:31.071 --> 38:32.352
HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.675
TEMPORARILY.
THE ANKLE WILL HEAL.

38:34.675 --> 38:36.517
I DON'T WANT TO
BE A YOUNG WIDOW.

38:36.517 --> 38:37.678
LIKE ME?

38:37.678 --> 38:39.520
NO.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.361
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.083
I HAD NO TIME
WITH HUBBELL.

38:43.083 --> 38:45.686
24 HOURS.

38:45.686 --> 38:47.848
BUT IT WAS A PRETTY
GREAT 24 HOURS.

38:47.848 --> 38:48.969
YEAH.

38:48.969 --> 38:51.171
YOU'LL HAVE TIME.

38:51.171 --> 38:52.693
DO I LOOK OKAY?

38:52.693 --> 38:54.174
DO YOU LOOK OKAY?

38:54.174 --> 38:55.536
‐ YOU MAY KILL HIM
WITH THAT LOOK.
‐ MICHELLE.

38:55.536 --> 38:56.697
I MEAN IT.
CROSS YOUR EYES

38:56.697 --> 38:58.018
OR PICK YOUR TEETH
WITH YOUR TONGUE

38:58.018 --> 38:59.700
WHILE YOU'RE
WALKING DOWN THE AISLE,

38:59.700 --> 39:00.941
BECAUSE OTHERWISE
THE MAN'S HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

39:00.941 --> 39:02.943
AND LIVES. HAS A
HEART ATTACK AND LIVES.

39:13.754 --> 39:15.796
SHE BLEW AN ANTELOPE'S
HEAD OFF?

39:15.796 --> 39:16.797
CLEAN OFF.

39:16.797 --> 39:17.958
THAT'S CRAZY.

39:17.958 --> 39:19.920
SHE JUST SAID ALL THAT
TO INTIMIDATE ME.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.162
‐ BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER BROTHER?
‐ I DON'T KNOW. ASK HER.

39:22.162 --> 39:24.925
I THOUGHT SHE WAS ALL ABOUT
PEACE, LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING.

39:24.925 --> 39:26.607
WAIT, SO WAS SHE
THREATENING YOU?

39:26.607 --> 39:28.809
‐ STAND DOWN, HULK.
‐ SHE SHOULDN'T
THREATEN YOU.

39:28.809 --> 39:30.130
SHE JUST CAME UP
AND TOLD YOU THIS?

39:30.130 --> 39:31.411
I MEAN,
JUST OUT OF THE BLUE?

39:31.411 --> 39:33.574
YES,
FOR THE MOST PART.

39:33.574 --> 39:36.496
I MEAN, I WAS
KIND OF SNIFFING
HER BROTHER'S JACKET.

39:36.496 --> 39:38.018
‐ WHAT?
‐ IT WAS A MOMENT.

39:38.018 --> 39:39.179
TO NEVER REPEAT.

39:41.141 --> 39:43.303
WOW.
ALL DOLLED UP.

39:43.303 --> 39:44.585
FRIEND JUST
GOT MARRIED.

39:44.585 --> 39:45.666
YOU LOOK
REALLY NICE.

39:45.666 --> 39:46.747
THANK YOU.

40:05.165 --> 40:06.767
‐ WHAT WAS THAT?
‐ IT WAS A CONDOM.

40:06.767 --> 40:08.609
I KNOW WHAT IT WAS.
WHAT WAS MICHELLE DOING?

40:08.609 --> 40:09.850
WAS SHE OFFERING IT TO US?

40:09.850 --> 40:11.331
THAT'S A MISDEMEANOR
AT LEAST.

40:11.331 --> 40:12.893
IT FELT MORE LIKE
SHE FOUND IT.

40:12.893 --> 40:14.254
AND THOUGHT IT
WAS ONE OF OURS?

40:14.254 --> 40:16.096
SO THAT WAS A CONDOM,
NOT A MINT?

40:16.096 --> 40:17.457
IT WAS A CONDOM, BOO.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.059
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO BUY ONE OF THOSE.

40:19.059 --> 40:21.181
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.
YOU GET SOME MONEY,

40:21.181 --> 40:22.943
YOU GO TO A DRUGSTORE,
AND YOU BUY THEM.

40:22.943 --> 40:25.185
COME ON. IT'S NOT LIKE
BUYING PAPER TOWELS, SASHA.

40:25.185 --> 40:26.867
PEOPLE IN LINE
AND THE CHECK‐OUT PERSON.

40:26.867 --> 40:28.348
‐ THEY JUDGE YOU.
‐ JUDGE YOU HOW?

40:28.348 --> 40:29.630
FOR BEING
A HUMAN BEING?

40:29.630 --> 40:30.751
WITH NATURAL URGES?

40:30.751 --> 40:31.792
PEOPLE DO JUDGE YOU.

40:31.792 --> 40:33.794
I MEAN, I LOOK.
I JUDGE.

40:33.794 --> 40:35.195
SO SQUEAMISH.

40:35.195 --> 40:37.558
I WOULD EXPECT THAT FROM BOO,
BUT NOT FROM YOU TWO.

40:37.558 --> 40:38.799
I DON'T NEED
TO BUY CONDOMS.

40:38.799 --> 40:40.280
I'M ON THE PILL.

40:41.682 --> 40:43.083
‐ WHAT?
‐ SINCE WHEN?

40:43.083 --> 40:44.805
AS SOON AS MY MOTHER
HEARD ABOUT CARL,

40:44.805 --> 40:46.046
SHE MARCHED ME
DOWN TO THE DOCTOR'S

40:46.046 --> 40:47.047
AND PUT ME
ON THE PILL.

40:47.047 --> 40:48.849
YOU AND CARL
ARE HAVING SEX?

40:48.849 --> 40:50.370
WHAT? NO.

40:50.370 --> 40:52.052
‐ THEN WHY ARE
YOU ON THE PILL?
‐ I JUST TOLD YOU.

40:52.052 --> 40:53.133
I'M GOBSMACKED.

40:53.133 --> 40:54.655
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

40:54.655 --> 40:56.376
I DON'T KNOW. I STICK IT
IN A PEPPERMINT PATTY.

40:56.376 --> 40:57.898
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:57.898 --> 40:59.580
BOO IS ON THE PILL.

40:59.580 --> 41:00.741
YOU'RE HAVING
SEX WITH CARL?

41:00.741 --> 41:02.503
WHY DOES EVERYBODY HEAR
I'M ON THE PILL

41:02.503 --> 41:04.344
AND AUTOMATICALLY THINK
I'M HAVING SEX?

41:04.344 --> 41:06.667
YOU ARE ABSURD, BOO.
YOU KNOW THAT?

41:06.667 --> 41:08.228
‐ ABSURD.
‐ WHY?

41:08.228 --> 41:10.230
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE PILL
BUT NOT HAVING SEX.

41:10.230 --> 41:11.872
IT'S LIKE HAVING
A SUPERPOWER AND NOT USING IT.

41:11.872 --> 41:13.233
I'LL USE IT EVENTUALLY.

41:13.233 --> 41:14.835
CARL AND I ALREADY
MAPPED OUT OUR FIRST TIME.

41:14.835 --> 41:16.076
IT'S GOING TO BE
AT SENIOR PROM.

41:16.076 --> 41:17.798
WARN ME SO I CAN
AVERT MY EYES.

41:17.798 --> 41:18.999
THAT'S A YEAR
AND A HALF AWAY.

41:18.999 --> 41:21.081
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S
WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE.

41:21.081 --> 41:22.523
ACTUALLY, IT'S GOING
TO BE THE NIGHT BEFORE

41:22.523 --> 41:24.525
THE SENIOR PROM
SO WE CAN GET IT
OUT OF THE WAY

41:24.525 --> 41:25.646
SO WE HAVE FUN
AT THE PROM.

41:25.646 --> 41:27.007
NOW I'VE HEARD
EVERYTHING.

41:27.007 --> 41:29.690
‐ HEY.
‐ YES? WHAT, DEZ?

41:29.690 --> 41:30.851
NOTHING.

41:30.851 --> 41:32.853
I JUST HEARD
YOU GUYS HAD CONDOMS.

41:32.853 --> 41:33.934
GET LOST, DEZ.

41:41.942 --> 41:43.864
YEAH.

41:43.864 --> 41:46.066
I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO TALK ABOUT ME.

41:46.066 --> 41:47.868
EVERYBODY.
THE FIRE IS OUT.

41:47.868 --> 41:49.870
THERE WAS NO
PROPERTY DAMAGE

41:49.870 --> 41:52.272
AND NO INJURIES.
YOU CAN GO HOME.

41:52.272 --> 41:54.915
( cheering )

41:54.915 --> 41:56.877
‐ SURVIVED ANOTHER ONE.
‐ RIGHT ON.

41:56.877 --> 41:58.278
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

42:02.723 --> 42:04.284
‐ HEY, THERE.
‐ HI.

42:04.284 --> 42:05.886
SO, I'LL TAKE THE JOB.

42:05.886 --> 42:07.768
‐ WHAT JOB?
‐ DRAWING LESSONS.

42:09.209 --> 42:12.012
MY SISTER SAID YOU
WANTED DRAWING LESSONS?

42:12.012 --> 42:14.615
‐ SHE SAID THAT?
‐ DID I HEAR WRONG?

42:14.615 --> 42:16.937
NO. YES,
I WANT LESSONS.

42:16.937 --> 42:18.779
GREAT. GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.
I'LL PUNCH IN MY NUMBER.

42:18.779 --> 42:19.900
OH. WILL DO.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.902
WE CAN MEET
AT YOUR PLACE,

42:21.902 --> 42:23.744
MY PLACE,
WHATEVER.

42:23.744 --> 42:25.065
I'M PRETTY
AVAILABLE.

42:25.065 --> 42:26.306
ME TOO.

42:26.306 --> 42:27.908
AND THANK HER FOR ME

42:27.908 --> 42:29.750
FOR PASSING
MY MESSAGE ON.

42:29.750 --> 42:30.911
WILL DO.

42:37.998 --> 42:39.319
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

42:39.319 --> 42:40.921
<i>Michelle.</i>
<i>It's Bash, come in.</i>

42:40.921 --> 42:42.322
HEY, BASH.
WHERE ARE YOU?

42:42.322 --> 42:43.844
COME ON OVER.

42:43.844 --> 42:45.926
<i>I just wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for all your hard work.</i>

42:45.926 --> 42:48.488
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I THINK WE MADE
A PRETTY SUCCESSFUL TEAM.

42:48.488 --> 42:49.570
<i>Definitely.</i>

42:49.570 --> 42:51.932
AND I BELIEVE IT'S
TIME WE CELEBRATE

42:51.932 --> 42:53.774
‐ OUR SUCCESS.
‐ <i>Come again?</i>

42:53.774 --> 42:55.776
THE CHAMPAGNE.
BREAK IT OUT, MAN.

42:55.776 --> 42:57.097
<i>But I'm not there.</i>

42:57.097 --> 42:58.098
WHAT?
WHERE ARE YOU?

42:58.098 --> 42:59.780
<i>On the road.</i>
<i>It's been a long night.</i>

42:59.780 --> 43:00.941
<i>I'm pooped.</i>

43:00.941 --> 43:01.942
BASH, YOU SNUCK OUT
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO

43:01.942 --> 43:03.504
SHARE THE CHAMPAGNE
WITH ME.

43:03.504 --> 43:05.105
<i>What's that?</i>
<i>You're breaking up.</i>

43:05.105 --> 43:07.427
‐ GET BACK HERE.
‐ <i>I must be getting</i>
<i>out of range.</i>

43:07.427 --> 43:09.790
BASH, YOU OWE
ME CHAMPAGNE!

43:09.790 --> 43:11.111
<i>( stammering )</i>

43:13.794 --> 43:15.796
( applause )
