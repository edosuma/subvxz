00:38.672 --> 00:41.573

03:41.956 --> 03:44.690
( horse neighs )

03:54.368 --> 03:56.335
Wade?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.706
Yep.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.378
M-Marcus.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.447
Marcus McCluskey.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.682
Marcus McCluskey?

04:10.684 --> 04:11.850
Yeah.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.751
( laughs )

04:12.753 --> 04:15.988
What the heck you doing
out here picking flowers?

04:15.990 --> 04:18.824
Uh, for my ma.

04:18.826 --> 04:19.858
Yeah?

04:19.860 --> 04:20.926
Eh.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.396
You always was
a mama's boy.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.664
( chuckles )

04:25.666 --> 04:27.399
Heh.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.268
How you been?

04:30.004 --> 04:31.770
I--I been good.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.338
( horse neighs )

04:33.340 --> 04:35.474
What are you
doing here?

04:36.477 --> 04:39.544
Came to see my family,

04:39.546 --> 04:41.280
find some peace.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.981
( horse grunts )

04:43.784 --> 04:46.985
I better be--
better be getting back.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.688
I'll ride with you.
Come on.

04:52.026 --> 04:52.691
All right.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.627
Good to see you
again, Wade.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.010
How's Jasper?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.579
He didn't make it back.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.083
Sorry to hear that.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.619
He was a good man.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.454
How are
your parents doing?

05:22.456 --> 05:25.924
My mama heard,
something went wrong
in her head.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.527
She hasn't been
the same since.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.462
And your pa?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.834
All right, well,
I'll ride over this week,

05:35.836 --> 05:37.669
give them
my condolences at--

05:37.671 --> 05:39.971
( cattle mooing )

05:41.842 --> 05:43.775
Marcus...

05:43.777 --> 05:46.044
where are
all your cattle?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.747
Army took 'em all.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.620
How you making ends meet?

05:56.824 --> 05:58.623
I--I can't be
late for supper.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.926
It's good--good
to see you, Wade.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.961
You, too.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.712
- All right.
- ( neighs )

06:25.753 --> 06:27.786
( pounding on door )

06:32.860 --> 06:35.694
( pounding on door )

06:36.630 --> 06:38.830
Man: Who goes there?

06:38.832 --> 06:40.565
Open up, Seamus.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.701
( rifle cocks )

06:42.703 --> 06:44.936
State your name.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.705
It's Wade.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.675
Wade?

06:57.184 --> 07:00.886
Oh. Howdy, Seamus.

07:00.888 --> 07:04.456
That's how
you're gonna greet
your brother-in-law?

07:07.461 --> 07:09.728
( door rattles )

07:13.667 --> 07:15.000
Abby.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.936
Uncle Wade.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.538
( gasps )

07:24.211 --> 07:26.044
Darling,

07:26.046 --> 07:28.580
let me look at you.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.651
( laughs )

07:32.653 --> 07:33.218
Look at you.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.087
I can't
believe it.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.060
All right.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.797
Sammy...

07:46.133 --> 07:49.901
you better
get over here,
hug your uncle.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.539
( laughs )

07:54.541 --> 07:55.707
Look at you.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.576
You're strong...

07:58.612 --> 08:00.846
like your old man.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.248
Wade.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.617
Seamus.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.621
Come here.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.057
Come here,
both of you.

08:20.734 --> 08:25.737
Hungriest I've
ever been, Arkansas.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.039
God-awful place.
Don't ever go.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.642
But they marched us
for four days

08:30.644 --> 08:33.010
to the battle
at Pea Ridge.

08:33.013 --> 08:33.945
No food.

08:33.947 --> 08:38.683
You get
a little bit of water,
but there's no food.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.854
And our general,
Earl Van Dorn...

08:43.789 --> 08:46.191
gives a big,
passioned speech

08:46.193 --> 08:48.760
about how--how a viper
has a split tongue,

08:48.762 --> 08:51.129
and we are
the split tongue
of the snake.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.631
There will be
a left flank,

08:52.633 --> 08:54.065
there will be
a right flank,

08:54.067 --> 08:55.066
and then
we will surround

08:55.068 --> 08:56.735
the blue bellies
with our tongue,

08:56.737 --> 08:59.204
- and we will gut them.
- ( laughing )

08:59.706 --> 09:02.941
So we find ourselves
in the woods at night,

09:02.943 --> 09:04.309
and it is dark.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.646
I mean, I can't even see
my big old nose.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.980
It is dark outside.

09:08.982 --> 09:13.818
And I'm standing there,
and no one's speaking,

09:13.820 --> 09:16.521
and we're just waiting.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.258
And all I can hear...

09:21.562 --> 09:23.595
is my stomach...

09:23.597 --> 09:24.129
( laughs )

09:24.131 --> 09:27.332
my stomach
yelling at me,

09:27.334 --> 09:29.968
"I need corn bread..."

09:29.970 --> 09:31.069
( laughing )

09:31.071 --> 09:31.903
"and I need beans."

09:31.905 --> 09:35.740
And then--and then
they give the--
the order to charge,

09:35.742 --> 09:38.076
and all I can
think to myself is,

09:38.078 --> 09:41.846
"Oh, Lord, please just
let me die in Texas."

09:41.848 --> 09:43.648
( laughing )

09:43.650 --> 09:47.319
And that was the battle
of Pea Ridge.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.856
So where's home now?

09:52.593 --> 09:55.293
Will you be staying
with us, Uncle Wade?

09:58.665 --> 10:02.334
That's up
to your father, Sammy.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.735
Papa?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.937
Uncle Wade
can stay, can't he?

10:05.939 --> 10:10.041
Afraid we don't have much
in way of a bed.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.982
You can stay
in my room.

10:17.985 --> 10:22.787
Abby, I don't need much.
You just dig me a hole.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.098
It's just
for a little while...

10:33.634 --> 10:37.602
till I can find
someplace a little
more permanent.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.973
My roof is yours.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.842
I appreciate that.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.813
( door closes )

10:58.058 --> 11:01.393
Don't feel right
being here without her.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.232
( sniffs )

11:07.234 --> 11:09.868
Her grave's in the field.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.072
You'll find it.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.090
( blade scrapes )

11:40.801 --> 11:41.366
Careful with that.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.369
Oh, I'm sorry, Uncle.
I--I was just, uh--

11:44.371 --> 11:47.172
No, no, no,
don't apologize.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.676
Just don't want you
hurting yourself is all.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.085
You still have these?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.787
Every one you made me.

12:03.156 --> 12:07.859
You used to say that
that was what you was
gonna be like out there.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.132
Sure did.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.340
( steady thumping )

12:25.178 --> 12:27.746
( thumping continues )

12:46.133 --> 12:48.333
( grunting )

12:58.879 --> 13:00.278
( sighs )

13:00.280 --> 13:02.046
Ah, damn it, Doris.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.516
It's like
fucking a corpse.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.847
( gunshot )

13:35.849 --> 13:36.915
Ahh, no,
you gotta--

13:36.917 --> 13:38.917
- Stupid rabbit.
- You gotta aim low.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.119
- I know. I know.
- Look, I'll--

13:41.121 --> 13:42.954
I'm gonna get it.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.123
I ain't stupid.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.227
Ah, come on.

13:49.229 --> 13:49.894
No.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.230
- I can't--
- Aim low, like--

13:52.232 --> 13:54.332
Okay, like this, right?

13:54.334 --> 13:58.469
Out here wasting time and
ammunition again, Marcus?

13:58.471 --> 14:00.572
Give me my damn riffle.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.176
Gotta--
We gotta eat, Pop.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.580
What,
you going hungry, son?

14:08.582 --> 14:10.582
Could learn
to catch our own.

14:10.584 --> 14:11.916
( sighs )
You mind telling me

14:11.918 --> 14:16.254
how a son
of mine could end up
so goddamn useless?

14:16.256 --> 14:16.921
( laughs )

14:16.923 --> 14:20.625
You ain't half the man
your brother was.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.560
Wade's back.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.462
Who?

14:24.464 --> 14:28.867
Wade, Mary's brother.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.002
La-de-da.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.272
You're useless.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.241
( laughs )

14:39.079 --> 14:41.079
Wait up, Pa!

14:51.224 --> 14:52.023
Morning.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.559
Morning.
So how do they fit?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.295
Mm, fit just fine, Abby.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.096
Whoo, look at this.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.632
You got your garden
looking real nice.

15:00.634 --> 15:01.266
Thank you.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.568
Got you mother's touch,
sweetheart.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.371
Come on.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.040
Howdy.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.276
Morning,
Uncle Wade.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.612
All right,
it's been a while.

15:14.614 --> 15:20.151
Maybe you could show me
how you've been doing
things around here, Sammy.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.536
Hey, Uncle,
bet you've never run
traps in a while.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.572
Ah, I seen a few
during the war.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.309
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.244
We'd be marching
through fields.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.278
Sometimes
in broad daylight,

15:47.280 --> 15:48.680
a grown man'd
step into one
of these things.

15:48.682 --> 15:53.117
And you know what sound
a grown man makes when
he steps into a trap?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.085
What?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.053
"Ouch."

15:55.055 --> 15:56.154
( laughs )

15:56.156 --> 15:58.356
Taking too long.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.326
All right.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.927
"Ouch."

16:12.105 --> 16:14.072
That's good.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.345
Seamus:
Samuel.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.987
Seamus:
Hold these here.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.156
Hold these.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.260
Set this one here.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.430
( traps clanking )

17:03.523 --> 17:06.223
( horse neighs )

17:54.841 --> 17:57.141
What are you doing here?

17:57.644 --> 17:59.510
I had to see you.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.314
You crazy?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.316
Someone could've
seen you.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.321
He always checks
the traps this time.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.424
I thought a girl
as beautiful as you

18:13.426 --> 18:16.761
deserved better
than plain old mustard seed.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.529
Thank you.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.724
Till tomorrow, Abigail.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.797
( neighs )

19:16.623 --> 19:18.289
Now, Sammy, a boar,

19:18.291 --> 19:21.592
they're
creatures of habit,
just like people.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.729
They tend to follow
the same routines.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.465
So now if he's
bedding up down there,

19:27.467 --> 19:31.736
chances are he's
gonna follow this path
down to the river,

19:31.738 --> 19:34.238
which means,
if we get lucky,

19:34.240 --> 19:36.707
we'll run
right into him.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.672
Ah, look at you.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.741
Oh, what you made of?

20:10.743 --> 20:14.412
- You made of meat.
- ( pats carcass )

20:15.782 --> 20:18.382
- ( grunts )
- ( metal clattering )

20:18.384 --> 20:20.751
Look at you.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.355
Oh, you--

20:24.357 --> 20:26.457
Oh, come on.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.459
Daddy's
gonna be happy.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.429
( grunting )

20:43.943 --> 20:46.377
( footsteps )

21:05.398 --> 21:06.931
Pa!

21:08.801 --> 21:10.534
Pa!

21:13.940 --> 21:17.408
That's a mighty nice piece
you got there, boy.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.443
It's a big pig.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.645
Good eating.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.414
Where you been?

21:24.050 --> 21:25.983
Out, riding.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.385
Riding?

21:27.387 --> 21:31.355
Look what your brother
brought home for us.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.493
What you been doing
for the family?

21:35.495 --> 21:40.431
You need to man up, son,
and stop daydreaming.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.734
Good job, boy.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.538
I caught him.
You clean him.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.906
No, come on.
You gotta help--

21:48.908 --> 21:50.574
I caught him.
You clean him.

21:50.576 --> 21:51.742
Dillard, come back!

21:51.744 --> 21:53.411
( laughs )

21:53.413 --> 21:55.012
( door closes )

21:55.014 --> 21:57.381
( sighs )

22:01.954 --> 22:04.789
Sam:
I'm sick of eating this.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.792
You ever had raw mule?

22:08.961 --> 22:11.362
No, but I had
a locust once.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.465
It just--it just
popped in my mouth
like a berry,

22:14.467 --> 22:15.700
and--and it
just flew around,

22:15.702 --> 22:17.768
and I could feel
its little wings
flapping.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.604
Oh, and then,
one time, this fly
went down my throat,

22:20.606 --> 22:22.940
and it was buzzing
all the way down.
It--It tickled.

22:22.942 --> 22:26.777
How long have the McCluskeys
been stealing from you?

22:34.654 --> 22:35.886
How long?

22:39.926 --> 22:42.893
I don't know.
Since Mama died.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.797
Your old man
ain't doing nothing?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.603
It's not that bad.

22:53.473 --> 22:56.674
Pop says they're
just desperate,
like all folk.

22:56.676 --> 23:00.911
Well, they can catch
their own goddamn food.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.482
They don't know
how to trap.

23:04.484 --> 23:08.652
They don't
know the spots,
how to catch 'em.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.856
Not like Pop does.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.945
May this food
restore our strength,

23:34.947 --> 23:36.947
giving new energy
to tired limbs,

23:36.949 --> 23:38.616
new thoughts
to weary minds,

23:38.618 --> 23:40.551
giving new visions
of dry spirits,

23:40.553 --> 23:41.519
new warmth
to cold hearts,

23:41.521 --> 23:44.855
and once refreshed,
may we give new
pleasure to you,

23:44.857 --> 23:45.723
who gives us all.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.725
Please be with Mama
in Heaven.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.460
And protect
Uncle Wade.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.862
- Amen.
- Amen.

23:51.864 --> 23:52.963
Amen.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.100
Amen.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.968
You hear that?

23:57.970 --> 23:59.770
That is
the type of love

23:59.772 --> 24:02.206
that kept me
in one piece out there.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.509
Did you think
I could hear you, hmm?

24:05.511 --> 24:06.477
In my darkest moment,

24:06.479 --> 24:08.112
I knew you two were
right there with me.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.047
Oh, we was only praying
for you to come back

24:10.049 --> 24:12.550
so you could shoot us
some dinner like you done.

24:12.552 --> 24:13.651
Wade:
Oh, Abby just ruined it.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.120
I don't want to hear
you joking about your
prayers to the Lord.

24:16.122 --> 24:20.191
Oh, heaven forbid you have
a sense of humor, Lord.

24:20.193 --> 24:21.125
- ( laughs )
- Mm, I know.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.561
I know it's not boar,
but raccoon will have to do.

24:23.563 --> 24:27.531
Of course, them McCluskeys
got a thing or two to do
about that, don't they?

24:27.533 --> 24:28.866
Hmm, now,
if it was up to me--

24:28.868 --> 24:30.801
I know it's not--
I'd go over there,

24:30.803 --> 24:32.203
and I'd wring
their necks,

24:32.205 --> 24:33.471
teach them
a lesson or two.

24:33.473 --> 24:34.171
That's enough, Wade.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.506
Mm, you have
not instilled in me

24:35.508 --> 24:38.142
the sense of patience
that you've instilled
in my brother-in-law,

24:38.144 --> 24:40.644
my brother-in-law,
who can pray for
a problem to go away.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.582
- You're real good at that,
ain't you, Seamus?
- ( table bangs )

24:47.153 --> 24:49.854
I said that's enough.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.850
You say your prayers?

25:36.536 --> 25:39.970
You know, when I was
about your age...

25:41.274 --> 25:43.641
my pa, he...

25:44.877 --> 25:47.011
he asked me...

25:48.281 --> 25:52.883
what I would do
if I came across a wolf.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.086
Would I panic...

25:58.124 --> 26:00.057
and run off?

26:01.827 --> 26:04.962
Would I try
to scare it off?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.799
Or would I...

26:11.137 --> 26:13.938
would I just leave it be

26:13.940 --> 26:18.142
and act like I never
saw it to begin with?

26:22.748 --> 26:24.114
You'd kill it.

26:32.959 --> 26:36.293
Even if it
never did me harm?

26:38.097 --> 26:40.097
But it could.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.937
( sighs )

26:56.849 --> 26:58.215
( sniffs )

27:18.170 --> 27:21.772
( door creaks )

27:45.965 --> 27:47.831
( gasps )

28:21.067 --> 28:23.400
( thunder rumbles )

29:30.202 --> 29:33.203
Quite a spot
you got you here.

29:43.149 --> 29:47.518
      I'll clean up for you
           little bit.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.286
Let's see.

29:51.991 --> 29:52.556
I got you these.

29:52.558 --> 29:56.160
         I'm just gonna
   set 'em right here for you.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.830
You do with 'em
what you want.

29:59.832 --> 30:01.865
( chuckles )

30:01.867 --> 30:03.867
Kids are all right.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.337
Abby's all grown up.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.239
She's--

30:09.241 --> 30:11.542
She's a woman,

30:11.544 --> 30:13.944
reminds me of you.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.982
Sammy's--

30:18.984 --> 30:20.350
He's good.

30:20.352 --> 30:24.321
          He's strong,
      and he's a sweet kid.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.024
You done a good job.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.494
( music playing )

30:43.309 --> 30:45.876
( music playing only )

31:02.294 --> 31:04.828
( insects chirping )

31:05.431 --> 31:07.130
( match flicks )

31:10.569 --> 31:12.169
( hoofbeats )

31:12.171 --> 31:14.471
( horse snorting )

31:21.146 --> 31:23.847
( horse neighs )

31:24.550 --> 31:27.651
Howdy, Mr. McCluskey.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.419
Howdy-do, Wade.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.955
Go on.
Make yourself at home.

31:31.957 --> 31:35.092
I ain't seen you
in a long time.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.226
( horse neighs )

31:36.228 --> 31:40.998
Been about five years
since my last visit.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.067
( clears throat )

31:44.069 --> 31:46.270
Yeah, well,
you're looking good.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.206
You come back
in one piece.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.441
I did better
than most.

31:52.044 --> 31:56.280
I wanted to come by
and give my condolences
for Jasper.

31:56.282 --> 32:02.653
Yeah, well, war has
to have its consequences,
don't it?

32:02.655 --> 32:05.022
Yeah, it does.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.262
So how long you
staying around here for?

32:12.264 --> 32:13.530
Ah, you know me.

32:13.532 --> 32:16.199
I like to come and go.

32:16.702 --> 32:20.103
But I figured
I'd try to stay on
for a while,

32:20.105 --> 32:22.239
make sure the family's
all right.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.008
I know
it's tough around here.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.378
Noticed
your cattle's gone.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.380
Yeah, well,
the Confederate boys,

32:30.382 --> 32:34.117
they come in here and
commandeered everything,

32:34.119 --> 32:36.620
but we're doing fine.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.289
Good.

32:41.460 --> 32:46.029
Well, if you need
anything from us,

32:46.031 --> 32:48.031
you don't hesitate
to ask.

32:48.033 --> 32:52.469
Well, that's mighty
neighborly of you, Wade.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.572
I appreciate you
saying that.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.409
But like I said,

32:59.411 --> 33:02.279
we're managing just fine.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.549
Yeah, cattleman
without cattle

33:05.551 --> 33:07.584
is doing just fine.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.357
Don't go dancing
around a maypole, son.

33:13.359 --> 33:16.159
You sound like
you got something to say.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.996
Oh, I ain't dancing.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.098
I'm just curious is all.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.133
Curious?

33:23.135 --> 33:25.135
( chuckles )

33:25.137 --> 33:27.437
A man,
he ought to be careful

33:27.439 --> 33:31.241
messing around with
another man's business.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.645
Couldn't have said that
better myself.

33:39.084 --> 33:42.519
You go mosey on now, Wade.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.521
Get off my porch.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.056
( match flicks )

33:51.397 --> 33:54.398
I was asking you nice.

33:55.467 --> 33:59.236
( horse neighs )

34:00.406 --> 34:01.638
( music playing )

34:01.640 --> 34:04.074
( whittling )

35:23.589 --> 35:26.456
You're so beautiful.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.167
Don't.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.201
( laughing )

35:38.203 --> 35:41.238
Are you afraid
of a little water?

35:42.608 --> 35:44.174
Oh.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.209
That's it.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.578
Okay, how do I do it?

35:48.580 --> 35:50.547
- So you sort of lean...
- ( laughs )

35:50.549 --> 35:53.450
and just give it
a smooth throw.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.218
Give it a try.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.288
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:58.891 --> 36:01.458
Let's see
what you got.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.695
Ooh. Frog. Ooh!

36:05.697 --> 36:06.830
( chuckles )

36:06.832 --> 36:08.331
( rocks clack )

36:14.540 --> 36:17.574
( yelps, laughs )

36:17.576 --> 36:19.442
What's wrong?

36:20.345 --> 36:22.179
It's nothing.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.882
Tell me.

36:25.884 --> 36:28.718
Your uncle came
to the house today,

36:28.720 --> 36:30.787
had words with Pa.

36:32.558 --> 36:36.293
For some reason,
he's got it out for us.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.761
( chuckles )

36:40.465 --> 36:43.200
Some reason?

36:43.202 --> 36:45.602
You know the reason.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.405
I know what Pop
and Dillard are doing

36:48.407 --> 36:49.406
ain't right, but--

36:49.408 --> 36:51.608
I ain't just them two.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.710
What am I
supposed to do?

36:53.712 --> 36:58.782
They'd beat the white
off of me if I didn't
go along with it.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.553
That's coward talk.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.290
I ain't no coward.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.308
( chopping continues )

37:25.310 --> 37:27.744
- Pa.
- Thank you, Abby.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.291
Sammy.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.416
( breathing heavily )

38:06.418 --> 38:08.718
( water sloshing )

38:11.490 --> 38:13.323
( exhales )

38:23.001 --> 38:25.802
( hoofbeats )

38:25.804 --> 38:28.438
( horse neighs )

38:38.917 --> 38:40.750
( horse neighs )

38:40.752 --> 38:42.919
Best make sure
that fire of yourn

38:42.921 --> 38:44.688
don't spread
on over to my land.

38:44.690 --> 38:49.526
You ride all the way
out here to tell me
about my fire, Randolph?

38:49.528 --> 38:52.329
Don't sass me,
Seamus.

38:52.331 --> 38:53.496
I rode out here
to tell you

38:53.498 --> 38:56.633
to keep that
wild dog of yourn
off my property.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.935
( horses neigh )

38:58.937 --> 39:00.804
Just trying to help.

39:00.806 --> 39:01.404
Help?

39:01.406 --> 39:04.607
I'm the one that
helped your sister
when she got sick.

39:04.609 --> 39:07.110
You didn't
tell him that,
did you, Seamus?

39:07.112 --> 39:08.878
Our debt's been paid,
Randolph.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.981
I'm the one
that decides when
your debt is paid,

39:11.983 --> 39:14.050
and you're far
from it, boy!

39:14.052 --> 39:15.952
( hoofbeats )

39:55.494 --> 40:02.098
"And God saw that
the wickedness of man
was great in the earth,

40:02.100 --> 40:06.503
"and that every imagination
of the thought

40:06.505 --> 40:11.574
"of his heart was
only evil continually.

40:11.576 --> 40:15.879
"And the Lord said,
'I will destroy men

40:15.881 --> 40:19.749
"'whom I have created
from the face of the earth...

40:19.751 --> 40:24.554
for it repenteth me
that I have made them.'"

40:24.556 --> 40:27.157
Boy, they are wretched.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.200
Why did you go there?

40:37.202 --> 40:41.037
Why do you let them
do this to you?

40:42.207 --> 40:45.708
That's not
your concern, Wade.

40:46.912 --> 40:51.214
Well, like it or not,
I am your family.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.850
I have a right to know.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.157
They don't take much.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.996
That's not the point.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.833
It's wrong.

41:09.835 --> 41:13.470
And you, of all people,
should know that.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.777
Let me help you.

41:22.514 --> 41:24.981
I don't need your help.

41:29.821 --> 41:33.256
"The earth was
filled with violence.

41:33.258 --> 41:34.224
And God said--"

41:34.226 --> 41:36.125
I was in the war...

41:36.695 --> 41:43.132
I saw a lot of men
get down on their knees
and start praying.

41:43.134 --> 41:47.604
They died
all the same.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.140
Sometimes
in this life

41:51.142 --> 41:54.177
you need to do
things for yourself.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.624
( gasps )

42:24.643 --> 42:27.577
( distant wolf howls )

42:30.181 --> 42:34.017
( wolves howl, yip )

43:06.618 --> 43:08.952
( insects chirping )

43:15.193 --> 43:16.759
( gasps )

43:18.830 --> 43:20.630
( man laughing )

43:20.632 --> 43:22.966
Oh, look. It's a 10.

43:22.968 --> 43:24.801
( laughs )

43:27.872 --> 43:30.073
All right, jeez, man.

43:30.075 --> 43:32.108
Look at this here.

43:32.110 --> 43:32.909
( trap clatters )

43:32.911 --> 43:35.845
Nice. We got a...
( indistinct )

43:39.985 --> 43:43.853
( grunts )

43:43.855 --> 43:44.954
Howdy.

43:48.627 --> 43:50.860
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:50.862 --> 43:51.794
It's all right.

43:51.796 --> 43:52.729
It's just me, Wade.

43:52.731 --> 43:56.599
I was just
sitting there,
and I saw you.

43:56.901 --> 44:00.870
Just wanted
to say hello, Dill.

44:00.872 --> 44:02.238
It's been a while.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.240
What you want?

44:04.242 --> 44:05.308
Nothing.

44:05.310 --> 44:08.978
You wanna
put the gun down?

44:10.649 --> 44:14.884
I ain't--I ain't
supposed to talk to you.

44:14.886 --> 44:19.789
Ah, well, I ain't
gonna cause any trouble.

44:20.692 --> 44:22.291
Then what you want?!

44:22.927 --> 44:25.895
Nothing,
like I told you.

44:25.897 --> 44:28.164
Just wanna come by
and say howdy.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.933
Can't a guy
do that anymore?

44:37.042 --> 44:38.975
That's nice.

44:38.977 --> 44:42.779
That is a real
nice collection
you got there.

44:43.348 --> 44:47.183
No, no, no, I didn't
mean anything by that.

44:47.452 --> 44:54.123
Got yourself a raccoon,
skunk, and a rabbit.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.725
That's a big coon.

44:55.727 --> 44:59.028
That is
a big raccoon.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.230
Hey, you remember
that time

45:01.232 --> 45:04.734
when we were out
in your father's
pasture...

45:05.437 --> 45:07.103
and we spooked
the cattle?

45:07.105 --> 45:11.207
You remember that?
And they went running.

45:11.209 --> 45:12.341
Yeah.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.877
Craziest thing
I ever saw.

45:14.879 --> 45:15.344
( laughs )

45:15.346 --> 45:17.814
Them big dumb animals
running everywhere.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.449
And then
your--your old man

45:19.451 --> 45:22.852
comes crashing out
of that front porch,

45:22.854 --> 45:24.153
and he starts
yelling at us.

45:24.155 --> 45:26.155
- ( both laughing )
- You remember that?

45:31.329 --> 45:32.061
Uh-huh.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.396
What happened
after that?

45:33.398 --> 45:36.332
Uh, he's chasing us.

45:36.334 --> 45:39.168
- Uh-huh.
- And--And you says,
"Run for it,

45:39.170 --> 45:41.370
and I got away
from him 'fore...

45:41.372 --> 45:44.974
( chuckles )

45:48.179 --> 45:51.314
And you ain't
never said a thing.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.917
Yeah.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.856
( screaming )

46:02.360 --> 46:03.826
Please!

46:03.828 --> 46:07.029
Please! ( screams )

46:07.031 --> 46:09.832
Please!
( sobbing )

46:09.834 --> 46:11.901
( screams )

46:11.903 --> 46:15.238
Please! ( screams )

46:15.240 --> 46:18.207
( screaming )

46:18.209 --> 46:21.110
( music playing )

46:21.112 --> 46:23.379
Mama!

46:23.381 --> 46:26.849
Mama!

46:27.452 --> 46:29.852
( screams )

46:29.854 --> 46:31.521
Come on!

46:31.523 --> 46:34.524
( screams )

46:34.526 --> 46:37.026
Please!

46:37.028 --> 46:39.395
Please! God!

46:39.397 --> 46:41.497
( screams )

46:41.499 --> 46:44.066
Please!
( sobbing )

47:04.956 --> 47:07.023
( sniffs )

47:09.994 --> 47:11.961
Abigail.

47:11.963 --> 47:14.997
Just gonna
go pick some flowers.

47:37.856 --> 47:40.189
( steady creaking )

47:57.275 --> 47:58.941
Mama,

47:58.943 --> 48:03.145
you shouldn't be
in Jasper's room.

48:03.147 --> 48:04.614
( creaking )

48:04.616 --> 48:07.116
Mm. Mm.

48:07.919 --> 48:10.620
- ( wails ) I been--
- ( shushing )

48:10.622 --> 48:11.988
It's all right.

48:11.990 --> 48:13.356
( gasping )

48:13.358 --> 48:15.491
( shushing )

48:15.493 --> 48:18.294
- ( water splashes )
- ( shushing )

48:21.332 --> 48:23.499
( muttering )

48:23.501 --> 48:26.369
It's all right, Mama.

48:26.371 --> 48:28.905
Dillard?!

48:30.074 --> 48:31.440
You seen your brother?

48:31.442 --> 48:33.643
No. What was he doing?

48:33.645 --> 48:36.045
He was due back
hours ago.

48:36.047 --> 48:37.513
( door crashes )

48:39.117 --> 48:42.285
Dillard!
Come here, son.

48:42.287 --> 48:43.486
What...

48:43.488 --> 48:44.453
( grunting )
He--He...

48:44.455 --> 48:46.188
Who done this to you, boy?

48:46.190 --> 48:48.190
He did it.
He stole it, Pa.

48:48.192 --> 48:50.559
- ( groans )
- Who?

48:50.561 --> 48:51.527
Aah!

48:51.529 --> 48:53.396
It was Wade.

48:53.398 --> 48:55.531
- Ohh!
- Don't move, boy.

48:57.235 --> 48:59.168
Don't move.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.404
( wincing )

49:02.573 --> 49:04.573
( buzzing )

49:04.575 --> 49:07.677
( water lapping )

49:15.620 --> 49:18.487
You told me
it would stop.

49:23.428 --> 49:25.328
What do you want,
pelts, meat?

49:25.330 --> 49:26.629
I'll go get it
for you right now.

49:26.631 --> 49:29.598
Abby, please,
can you just tell him
to lay low, will you?

49:29.600 --> 49:32.568
Just let this all
blow over. Come on.

49:34.172 --> 49:37.974
What, so it can go back
to how it was?

49:37.976 --> 49:39.442
Yeah, exactly.

49:39.444 --> 49:41.644
Bet your father
would like that.

49:41.646 --> 49:42.745
Abby, I want
the same as you do.

49:42.747 --> 49:47.083
I just--
I need a little more time
to figure this out, okay?

49:48.286 --> 49:52.021
We--We ain't gotta
be like them.

49:53.524 --> 49:55.024
We're different. We both--

49:55.026 --> 49:57.660
We're different, and--

49:57.662 --> 50:02.999
Why do you think I want
to see you all the time? Hmm?

50:03.001 --> 50:05.034
( laughs )

50:05.036 --> 50:07.436
I'm the only girl
for miles.

50:07.438 --> 50:10.272
Don't want no other girl.

50:10.274 --> 50:12.174
I want you.

50:14.579 --> 50:17.213
I don't know.

50:17.215 --> 50:18.280
Hey,

50:18.282 --> 50:22.084
ain't nothing to worry about,
you hear me?

50:22.086 --> 50:22.585
You hear me?

50:22.587 --> 50:25.588
Everything's gonna
be just fine, okay?

50:39.537 --> 50:42.204
( horse neighing )

50:46.277 --> 50:47.510
( horse snorts )

50:47.512 --> 50:48.344
What's going on?

50:48.346 --> 50:52.515
Eh, nice of you
to join your family
for a change.

50:52.517 --> 50:54.316
What are you doing?

50:54.318 --> 50:55.384
What you think
we're doing?

50:55.386 --> 51:00.089
Think I'm gonna let
that son of a bitch
have his way with us?

51:00.091 --> 51:00.823
Dillard was stealing.

51:00.825 --> 51:04.226
You told him to.
What do you expect
Wade to do?

51:04.228 --> 51:06.128
( horse neighs )

51:06.130 --> 51:07.463
Listen to me, boy.

51:07.465 --> 51:09.698
You're gonna get
back up on that horse,

51:09.700 --> 51:11.200
and you're
gonna come with us,

51:11.202 --> 51:15.204
or as God is
my witness, I'm gonna
kill you dead.

51:15.206 --> 51:17.573
( heavy breathing )

51:22.213 --> 51:24.280
Hold that
right there, Sammy.

51:24.282 --> 51:28.117
Down low. Hold it low.
Both hands.

51:31.155 --> 51:33.622
All right,
go ahead. Let go.

51:46.237 --> 51:48.404
What you got there?

51:51.509 --> 51:54.477
Thought Sammy
might like it.

51:57.248 --> 51:59.482
( whittling )

52:06.891 --> 52:08.591
( blows )

52:12.163 --> 52:15.898
It must've been horrible
out there in that war.

52:15.900 --> 52:19.235
Is this the peace
you were looking for?

52:20.738 --> 52:23.172
Work keeps me busy.

52:23.174 --> 52:25.641
( whittling )

52:30.748 --> 52:32.381
Uncle...

52:32.383 --> 52:36.485
I know
the McCluskeys have
been bothering you.

52:39.624 --> 52:42.424
Seems like
I'm the only one.

52:42.426 --> 52:43.559
That ain't true.

52:43.561 --> 52:47.830
Okay, no one likes it,
but they leave us alone.

52:47.832 --> 52:51.167
It really
ain't that bad.

52:55.907 --> 53:01.210
You think your mother
would've stood for it?

53:08.886 --> 53:11.520
Things will change.

53:11.956 --> 53:15.357
The war's over now,
and they'll get
their business back,

53:15.359 --> 53:18.761
and they won't have
no need for us anymore.

53:19.931 --> 53:21.697
You'll see.

53:32.810 --> 53:36.579
I caught
that Dillard prowling
through our traps.

53:37.848 --> 53:40.950
He left right quick,
though.

53:40.952 --> 53:43.319
Dropped all
them pelts, too.

53:43.321 --> 53:45.421
You shouldn't
have hurt him, Wade.

53:45.423 --> 53:48.324
Can't give McCluskey
no reason.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.330
I didn't touch him.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.434
I-I'm just afraid
that you might

53:58.436 --> 54:01.303
if you were
to catch him again.

54:07.411 --> 54:11.580
All I want is
for us to be safe,

54:11.582 --> 54:13.882
for Sammy
to be safe.

54:21.726 --> 54:24.660
That's all I want, too.

54:50.621 --> 54:53.789
( horse neighs )

54:59.463 --> 55:04.066
( hoofbeats )

55:04.068 --> 55:06.068
- ( gear clanking )
- ( gasps )

55:06.070 --> 55:09.471
( horse neighs )

55:17.581 --> 55:20.849
( door creaks open )

55:32.029 --> 55:34.797
Children, go inside.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.503
Come on, Sammy.

56:04.061 --> 56:06.729
What have you done?

56:10.468 --> 56:14.737
I'm not gonna
sit back and let them
muck my family.

56:14.739 --> 56:15.804
( trap rattles )

56:15.806 --> 56:16.772
This is my family, Wade.

56:16.774 --> 56:19.007
I told my sister
I'd look out
for those kids.

56:19.009 --> 56:21.877
She has got nothing
to do with this!

56:23.080 --> 56:25.514
Yes, she does.

56:25.516 --> 56:28.050
This is your debt.

56:29.086 --> 56:30.586
You have no idea.

56:30.588 --> 56:33.822
I did everything,
everything.

56:33.824 --> 56:34.957
Bullshit.

56:34.959 --> 56:37.860
You and I
both know that,

56:37.862 --> 56:40.596
and she was
your wife.

56:43.601 --> 56:46.602
Don't you think
I know that?

56:46.604 --> 56:50.072
We took a pact
before God--

56:50.074 --> 56:51.407
Fuck God!

56:51.976 --> 56:55.911
She was the godliest
creature I ever saw!

56:58.649 --> 57:01.650
He says,
"Thou shalt not steal,"

57:01.652 --> 57:05.654
and you let
these animals
steal from you?

57:05.656 --> 57:08.457
You're a coward, Seamus.

57:09.660 --> 57:10.893
You are a coward,

57:10.895 --> 57:12.895
and you are
not righteous,

57:12.897 --> 57:14.563
and you are not holy.

57:14.565 --> 57:18.133
She got sick, and you
turned your back.

57:26.043 --> 57:27.643
( clicks )

57:29.113 --> 57:31.547
( footsteps )

57:39.757 --> 57:41.924
"If any of you lack wisdom,

57:41.926 --> 57:45.561
"let him ask of God,
that giveth all men
liberally...

57:45.563 --> 57:48.230
"let him ask in faith,

57:48.232 --> 57:49.031
"Nothing wavering:

57:49.033 --> 57:54.436
for he that waverth
is like the wave
of the sea..."

57:59.210 --> 58:01.710
( music playing )

58:05.816 --> 58:10.652
"A double-minded man is
unstable in all his ways."

58:30.875 --> 58:33.108
( panting )

58:39.116 --> 58:40.616
( wood clatters )

59:45.749 --> 59:47.249
( spits )

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:17.646
Uncle Wade?

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.851
Uncle Wade?

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:34.696
Morning, Uncle Wade.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:36.064
Papa went to town,

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:39.167
said you needed
to set those traps.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:46.708
It's true
what you said...

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.077
about Mom and all.

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:54.950
Good man stands up
for his family...

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:58.253
for his country.

01:00:58.255 --> 01:01:01.757
He didn't even
fight in the war.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.296
Uncle Wade...

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:13.035
when you leave,
I wanna go with you.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:17.439
I wanna see
what the world's
like out there,

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:20.308
see all the things
you've seen...

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:23.712
fight alongside you.

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.914
I don't want
to stay here

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.282
and become
like my father.

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:28.817
Hell, I wish the war
wasn't over,

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:29.918
so that when
I was old enough,

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.320
I could've fought
and killed all
them dirty Yankees,

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:33.822
just like you did.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.967
( chair clatters )

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:53.408
You wanna know
what it was like?

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:03.685
You really think
you can do what I do?

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:06.288
Do you?

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:09.224
- Do you?!
- ( yelps )

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.793
( breathing heavily )

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.471
( water splashes )

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.073
Hi there.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.410
I came here to be alone.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:04.780
Abigail,
wait, wait, wait.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:08.984
Were you a part of it?

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:11.419
- I tried to stop it,
but my father--
- You're a coward.

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:15.490
None of this would've
happened if it weren't
for your stupid uncle..

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:17.993
And your whole
godless family.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.238
I'm sorry.

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:50.792
Leave with me.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:55.163
We can go away
from all of this.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:56.832
What?

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:58.600
I can get a job in town.

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:01.503
I'd take care of us,
Abby. You know I would.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:04.172
I--We could start
a family of our own.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.474
Don't be foolish.

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:08.143
I couldn't leave them.

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.511
Sure you could.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.613
Sure you could.
They'd be all right.

01:04:11.615 --> 01:04:13.481
What about your mother?

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:18.186
Think your brother
could take care of her
like you do?

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:25.093
Ain't nothing left
for me here...

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.301
nothing but you.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:56.024
( kissing )

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:32.327
How were things
in town today?

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.029
Good and nice.

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.631
Ain't nothing
but boring old flowers.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:40.035
They got roses up past
the McCluskey house.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:44.506
I don't want you
going near there,
okay, Abigail?

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:46.508
I was just riding by.

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:51.613
You steer clear
of there. You hear me?

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:58.219
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could put
the past behind us?

01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:01.056
What is done
cannot be undone.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:04.392
Families
have been desperate
because of the war.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:09.464
You haven't been here,
and so you don't what
it's been like.

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:13.668
I believe I have
a fairly good idea

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.604
of what the war
was like, Abby.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:17.706
I was there.

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.574
But not here.

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:25.213
We're blessed
that Papa's good
at what he does.

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.350
We had food
when other families didn't.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.354
Does that make it okay?

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:36.291
The Lord teaches us
to forgive.

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:38.259
Ain't that right, Papa?

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:40.328
Seamus:
That's right, Abigail.

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:48.036
I'm sorry.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:53.508
I'm sorry for that
whole wretched family.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.310
Wheezing pig
of a father,

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:57.545
brain-dead mother,
retard for a boy.

01:06:57.547 --> 01:06:58.747
Who's the other boy?
Marcus?

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:02.350
I've known him since
he was young, and he was
always kind of soft.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.519
Now he's just like
the rest of 'em,

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.054
a slave to his old man,

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:07.155
a good-for-nothing
coward.

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:08.523
He ain't like him.

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:17.432
Why are you
defending him?

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:22.537
You said it yourself.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.608
They do what
their father tells them.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:39.320
Say grace, Abigail.

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:44.025
( sighs )

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.327
May this food
restore our strength,

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:48.630
giving new energy
to tired limbs,

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:51.066
new thoughts
to weary minds,

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:52.667
giving new visions
to dried spirits

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:55.503
and new warmth
to cold hearts.

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:57.305
And once refreshed,

01:07:57.307 --> 01:07:59.407
may we give
new pleasure to you,

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.042
who gives us all.

01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:04.112
Please be with Mama
in Heaven.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:07.482
( music playing )

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:24.064
( moaning )

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.850
- ( music stops )
- ( gun clicks )

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.604
Go back to sleep, Sammy.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.189
( water splashing )

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.898
That feel good,
sweetheart?

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.135
( footsteps )

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.451
Hey, Mama.

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:52.687
How you doing?

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.698
Hey.

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:16.544
You look tired, Pa.
I could--

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.947
I can take over.

01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:27.722
You hear that, Doris?

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:32.493
Your boy's
gonna take care of you.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.330
Mm.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:39.567
Mm.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:43.404
( kiss )

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.245
Mm.

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:11.566
There's something I
haven't told you, Mama.

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:16.537
I got a girl.

01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:44.565
Would you mind
if I had this?

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:48.336
Will you please--
Please, Mama.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.504
( moans )

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:51.005
- Everything's--
- ( grunts )

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:52.473
It's all right,
Mama. Please.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.474
- ( moaning )
- We're--

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:54.942
We're gonna be happy
together, Mama.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:57.111
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:11:57.113 --> 01:11:58.546
( shushing )
It's all right.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:00.014
It's all right,
please, Mama!

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.649
We're gonna
be happy--

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.418
Mama, please,
please, please!

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.586
I need this, Mama!
Please!

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:07.922
I need--( gasping )

01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:15.930
Oh.

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:18.833
Oh.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.336
( music playing )

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.466
We can't
keep doing this.

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:52.800
Doing what?

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.836
This.

01:12:54.838 --> 01:12:57.805
Meeting in secrecy
all the time.

01:12:57.807 --> 01:12:58.806
( rocks clatter )

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:01.476
What if someone was
to find out about us?

01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:02.477
Don't worry
about that.

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.412
Your father's the one
who doesn't--

01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:06.581
Don't worry
about it, Abigail.

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:13.488
And so you're gonna turn
your back on him and run?

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:19.427
If it means
we can be together.

01:13:38.882 --> 01:13:40.715
It's beautiful.

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:47.588
This--This is
our way out of here.

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:49.624
We don't even need
to run away.

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:52.727
We can just
leave together.

01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:59.033
I love you, Abigail.

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:48.783
( water splashes )

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:55.790
Hi there, Wade.

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:00.862
( water splashes )

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:04.966
Can I ask you a question?

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:08.269
Can I try on your hat?

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:10.238
Please?

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:12.907
- It'd mean a lot to me.
- I gotta be--

01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:16.511
It'd mean a lot to me.
I'm not gonna mess it up.

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:21.816
What do you think?

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:22.617
Do I look smart?

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:24.719
Yeah, you look smart.
Can I have my hat?

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:26.821
That's a little bit
of a woman's hat.

01:15:26.823 --> 01:15:27.722
Hold on. Hold that.

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.790
Let me see
how you look with my hat.

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:31.959
That's a man's hat.
Look at that.

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.128
Look at that.
Look at you.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.765
You look good.

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:39.767
That's real nice.

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:50.878
( music playing )

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:06.227
( music playing only )

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:35.356
- ( water splashing )
- ( gasping )

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.191
Do you really think--
Look at me!

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:39.961
Look at me!
Look at me.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:40.828
( coughing )

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:44.031
Stay away
from that girl.

01:16:45.902 --> 01:16:48.736
( gasping )

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:57.745
( coughing )

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.761
( match flicks )

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:41.816
( sobbing )

01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:13.380
Marcus.

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:16.984
You turn around,
and look at me, son.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.060
Was it him
that done this to you?

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.429
Now don't you
lie to me, boy.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.899
I promise you, Pa,
it was an accident.

01:19:31.901 --> 01:19:33.000
An accident?

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:33.801
Yeah.

01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:34.769
Like what's gonna happen

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:38.472
to that girl of yours,
you don't tell me
the truth.

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:40.474
What?
You don't think I know

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:44.745
where my son goes
damn near every day?

01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:47.848
Don't you hurt her.

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:49.483
Was it him?!

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:51.519
Was it him?!

01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:00.227
( birds chirping )

01:20:10.006 --> 01:20:12.006
Get out of here.

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:30.791
( sighs )

01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:43.404
Pull.

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:00.180
Howdy.

01:22:11.193 --> 01:22:14.461
Before Earl Van Dorn
became General,

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:19.066
he was in charge
of Confederate forces
of Texas.

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:24.672
Mostly we were all on
recruiting trips then.

01:22:24.674 --> 01:22:28.142
He has a taste
for finer things
in life,

01:22:28.144 --> 01:22:30.077
including bird
for dinner.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.548
Well, we come across
these two pups,

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:38.986
and he asked,
"Who's good
with animals?"

01:22:39.722 --> 01:22:41.722
I said, "I am."

01:22:41.724 --> 01:22:45.192
Well, he says,
"Train them dogs."

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.329
And I did.

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:51.065
I trained them up
good and proper.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:52.199
I'd bag a bird.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:53.233
They'd go
and retrieve it

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:56.537
before I could blow
the smoke off my muzzle.

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:01.208
I loved them dogs.

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:10.451
Well, one night,

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:14.021
old Van Dorn wants
to join the hunt.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:17.124
He wants to bag
himself a bird,
and he does.

01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:20.194
It's big,
it's beautiful,

01:23:20.196 --> 01:23:23.030
colors like a rainbow.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:26.633
That bird goes down
over the horizon.

01:23:26.635 --> 01:23:29.003
Them dogs take off.

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:32.740
Thing is,
they don't come back.

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:37.311
So we go
charging after 'em,

01:23:37.313 --> 01:23:42.349
and we find them,
and they're tearing
that bird to pieces.

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:47.054
Limb from limb,

01:23:47.056 --> 01:23:49.023
eating pieces whole,

01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:52.226
blood on their snouts,
and it's in their teeth,

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:57.564
and Van Dorn tells me
to put them dogs down.

01:23:58.467 --> 01:24:01.101
Once they
got the taste for it,

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:03.203
they can't be trusted.

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:08.442
Didn't feel right...

01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:14.481
but it was an order.

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:16.517
He told me to do it,

01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:22.222
and so I shot
them dogs in the head
right then and there.

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:29.596
I think about
them dogs a lot.

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:34.201
Was it
their nature to kill?

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:39.073
I was training them
to go against it.

'Cause if you do that
to God's creatures
long enough...

( horse neighs )

01:26:12.535 --> 01:26:14.334
All right.

01:26:14.937 --> 01:26:18.172

Right there,
push on it.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.210
You gotta
push on it.

You're fine, Sammy.

There's nothing
wrong with you.

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:40.354
You be with the Lord.

     his days are as grass:
