- Really?
- Look, the last time I spoke to her,

06:55.040 --> 06:58.044
I was telling her
she had to go to the dentist,

06:58.120 --> 07:00.726
and she told I was being annoying.

That's the last thing she said to me.
"Dad, you're being annoying."

for the rest of my life

Well, great. Well, what can you do?

14:43.560 --> 14:45.528
I can ask escort you
to the perimeter of the premises.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.490
And if you resist, I can call the police.
That's what I can do.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.210
- Just get the fuck out of here.
- Come on, Kyle.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.725
Get the fuck out of here.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.848
- This is ridiculous.
- Get the fuck out of here.

Zach, you need to go.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.285

- Who?

16:11.360 --> 16:13.442
- Beth.
- Listen, (SCOFFS)

16:14.080 --> 16:16.606
if you're upset at me
for not returning your call...

16:16.680 --> 16:18.091
No, she is not dead. Is she?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.605
That's why you've been so secretive
about everything.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.806
- Zach, listen...
- Am I right?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.360
- Am I right, Maury? Just tell me.
- You're not right.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.566
- You're upset.
- Beth.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.564
- Listen, Zach, you need to leave.
- Beth! Beth!

- Mom.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.369
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh, Maury.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.130
Look who I found. It's Beth.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.840
- All right, calm down, Zach.
- It's Beth!

16:45.880 --> 16:47.644
What you doing? Hey, I have that scarf.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.051
What was I supposed to do?
He ran around me.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.929
- He made a juke, and he ran around me.
- Stop him in the hall!

16:52.720 --> 16:54.722

- It's a little bit hard to explain.
- GEENIE: Yes.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.201
How could you do this to me, Beth?

16:57.280 --> 16:59.408
- You made me think that you were...
- MAURY: Hey, hey, hey, hey, Zach.

16:59.480 --> 17:02.165
- She didn't do anything.
- Everything's normal. This just happened.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.641
- What just happened? What did I do?
- Nothing happened. It's normal.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.210
- You're fine.
- Everything is completely normal.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.486
- Just tell me. Just tell me.
- You're totally fine.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.324
- Tell me why you shut me out.
- Tell you what?

17:09.400 --> 17:12.801
Zach, why don't you and I go out
and have a little conversation in private?

17:12.880 --> 17:16.009
- No, Maury, no. You lied to me.
- I think that's a wonderful idea.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.127
- I never lied.
- BETH: What are you talking about?

17:17.200 --> 17:18.440
- Why are you acting all weird?
- Calm down.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.647
I'm not acting weird.
Stop playing dumb, Beth.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.564
- I'm not playing dumb. You're freaking out.
- That is no way talk to my daughter.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.166
- You know what? Fuck you people.
- Listen to me, Zach. You need to calm down.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.765
Look, this is good. This is a good thing.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.127
How could you people?
A fucking snakebite?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.009
Please stop. You're scaring me.
You're acting all crazy.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.241
This is all happening very fast.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.685
- No, I am not acting crazy.
- And you're confused.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.841
- You're all crazy.
- MAURY: You're confused.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.251
ZACH: Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

17:38.320 --> 17:39.731
- It's okay.
- All of you.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.484
You know what? You know what, Beth?

17:41.560 --> 17:45.121
It is one thing to say that
you want to see other people, okay?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.884
- What?
- I am a wreck.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.049
Don't say anything
you wouldn't want to say now like...

17:50.120 --> 17:51.884
You were supposed to be my friend.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.166
- I still am. We are friends.
- Wait a minute.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.210
- Who said I wanted to break up with you?
- Let's talk. You're upset. Let's talk.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.487
- Did Rachel say that to you?
- MAURY: We're all upset now...

17:58.560 --> 18:00.483
- Did she call you?
- MAURY: Listen, Zach.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.565
Oh, yeah, everything's great. Beth's alive.
It was all just one big hoax.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.483
So just forget about it.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.131
Well, I don't think that's funny.

There's a hole in the ground.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.850
Well... (SIGHS)

19:33.000 --> 19:34.729
She's not dead, Zach.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.407
Look, what kind of a grift is this?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.245
This is not a grift.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.764
Okay, okay.
Well, then why couldn't you tell me?

19:44.040 --> 19:46.725
Because she died.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.131
- What?
- She died.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.282
She died, and she's not dead now.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.365
I don't know why. But she's back.
Who cares why?

19:55.440 --> 19:56.885
My daughter's alive, Zach.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.123
Look, I am not stupid, okay?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.328
And I will go to the police.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.562
Tell me what happened.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.763

about a half an hour after you left

20:07.840 --> 20:09.251

20:09.320 --> 20:10.446
and it was Beth.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.523
We don't know how, okay?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.443
Okay. Okay, great.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.522
So this is not a grift, right?

20:17.600 --> 20:20.206
So then what is it?
Because you said she was really dead.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.402
And then you said she wasn't dead.
So, what are you saying?

20:22.480 --> 20:26.166
Are you saying that
she just dug herself out of her own grave

20:26.240 --> 20:28.971
- and then walked home?
- Yes.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.605
I don't know.

20:30.880 --> 20:31.881
She... Uh...

20:32.280 --> 20:33.964
Was it the type of snake?

20:34.040 --> 20:37.169
Was it a poison that didn't...
That made her seem dead?

20:37.240 --> 20:40.210
I'm not a herpetologist, Zach. I
don't know. She remembers nothing.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.886
I mean, what is that?
She's dead, now she's not dead.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.530
- What, she like...
- Crazy things happen.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.761
ZACH: She wasn't really dead?

20:45.840 --> 20:48.366
What is that? What are you saying?
Are you saying that she's a zombie?

20:48.440 --> 20:50.488
- She's my baby girl.
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.045
- It's a miracle.
- It's a miracle.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.724
- She's resurrected.
- She's resurrected.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.325

- She's resurrected!

Okay, and that's better why? Why is
that better? Because that's a nice...

21:01.120 --> 21:02.240
It's from the Old Testament.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.769

or MIT and have them study her?

- The attic? No. Why the attic?

21:23.480 --> 21:25.767
- She likes the attic.
- Why? What's with all this why?

21:25.840 --> 21:27.251
- Why? Why?
- Can't we just do something else?

21:34.040 --> 21:37.010
Go and tell her what you wanted to tell her
when you couldn't.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.361
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- No. Hold on a sec.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.090
You go first. I'm right behind you.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.803
What... What does that mean?

22:09.880 --> 22:12.167
Zach, why are you acting so weird?

22:13.360 --> 22:16.045
Like what's going on
with you and Mom and Dad?

22:16.120 --> 22:17.804
Everyone's so weird.

22:19.200 --> 22:23.000
Do you really not remember
what happened last week?

22:24.040 --> 22:28.250
I'm sorry. Did I do something
that pissed you off or something?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.330
Just tell me what you remember.

think straight right now.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.885
I Wish.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.728
What about breaking up with me?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.689
And what about...

22:56.760 --> 22:58.922
Why do you keep saying that?

23:00.200 --> 23:02.771
I don't want to break up with you, Zach.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.251

- I'm not being mean.

- I just...
- Yes, you are.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.124

a lot of thoughts about us recently.

- Um... No. No, no, no, no.

flamenco dancing with you

23:48.840 --> 23:50.330
And, um...

23:51.880 --> 23:55.282
And whenever you go away,

23:55.360 --> 23:57.931
you're the only thing I can think of.

23:58.640 --> 24:02.531
I think of you all the time too.
All the time.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.688
- You can borrow one of mine.
- Yeah.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.924
Well, I don't want to impose,
so maybe we could just go for a drive.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.002
- You're not imposing.
- It's just a bathing suit.

Is something wrong?

26:15.680 --> 26:17.569
I'm just really nervous
for that test tomorrow.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.681
What test?

26:19.800 --> 26:20.801
Oh.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.605

26:51.080 --> 26:52.650
Zach.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.246
Not right now, remember?

26:55.320 --> 26:56.845
No, I mean really eat me.

26:56.920 --> 27:01.084
Stop. Not with my parents around. Come on.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.527
That's so weird.
What was I just talking about?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.160
Nothing.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.451
You're so beautiful.

27:23.840 --> 27:26.525
I can't believe you're here.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.249
Where else would I be?

27:41.720 --> 27:45.008
- I had a really good time tonight.
- Me, too.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.805
- Good night.
- Good night.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.450
I love you.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.689
No, I love you more.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.649
Yes, I do.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.881
(LAUGHING) No.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.562
I want to eat your face off.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.846
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.002
I'm just cleaning Desert Eagle. Why?
It's not like you care.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.081
I care.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.400
Yeah, right.

Hey-

28:26.320 --> 28:27.651
Look, um...

28:28.600 --> 28:30.090
I'm really sorry about the other day.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.083
Okay, I know you were just doing your job,

28:32.160 --> 28:35.209
and I know that I can sound
condescending sometimes,

28:35.280 --> 28:39.046
but I actually really look up to you and...

28:39.120 --> 28:41.361
- You said Beth's alive.
- Yeah!

28:41.440 --> 28:44.922
Yeah, she is, and it's so great.
It's like love conquers all.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.720
- You're making fun of me or something?
- No, it's totally the truth.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.683
- Close the door, Zach.
- Just open your heart.

no up or down.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.091
Well, nothing. What do you mean?

Yeah, I understand.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.447
Uh-huh.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.090
Why don't you tell them to tell...

30:23.160 --> 30:24.366
MAURY: Unbelievable.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.089
She's building something.

30:27.160 --> 30:31.802
You know,
we really should let Beth know she died.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.566
- No. No.
- Well, I've opened up to her, you know?

30:35.640 --> 30:40.123
Yeah, but no, we're not gonna do that.
That'll just confuse her and make her upset.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.123
- That's not happening.
- GEENIE: Honey?

30:42.200 --> 30:43.361
What should I tell them?

30:43.440 --> 30:46.011
Tell them I'll come back
when I'm ready to come back.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.242
They have to stop calling
every five minutes.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.368

- Right.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.522
- And that is for a reason.
- Well...

30:52.600 --> 30:55.922
Also I think Pearline might have
something to do with this.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.530
- 'Cause she...
- No. Yeah, no.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.967
She disappeared
right before Beth appeared.

- And she's Haitian.
- No.

- Just think about it like this...
- Zachy. Zachy.

You're going down a rabbit hole.
This doesn't make any sense.

that you won't tell her.

start calling my dad Maury? Ew!

or light without dark.

It's not a blister. It's sunburn.

- Looks cute. (GRUNTS)

33:50.000 --> 33:51.001
Okay, no more.

- Honey, relax.
- You see, I told you shouldn't go,

33:52.960 --> 33:55.406
and now look. Look what happens.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.211
Honey, we'll just put
a little foundation on it.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.487

It's not that big of a deal.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.601
That's right.

34:01.680 --> 34:04.081
Maybe you should put some aloe on it
or something and a Band-Aid.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.322
Aloe? You think aloe's gonna do anything?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.090
- No more outings.
- ZACH: Whoa, whoa! Maury?

34:08.159 --> 34:10.731
Don't you go over my head, Zach.
That's final!

34:10.800 --> 34:12.404
Or we can use some of the aloe
from our front lawn.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.130
Geenie, stop triangulating.

34:14.199 --> 34:17.283
You know what? Maybe if we were just all
completely honest with one another...

34:17.360 --> 34:19.089
Enough already. Will you stop?

34:19.199 --> 34:22.170
No, you know what? Maury you are just
too jazzed to know what's what.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.766
Okay, look, this is simple.
If we just tell her...

34:24.840 --> 34:28.049
No. "Jazzed"? You want to know jazzed?
I'll tell you what, pal.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.442
I know! I know! I know!

34:31.520 --> 34:34.444

so she can study for her test.

- I was just getting something.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.566
Why?

37:35.640 --> 37:40.806
Because I am going to give you

37:42.600 --> 37:43.965
a concert.

What's going on?

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.801
- I'm doing my job protecting Briar Grove.
- We're going on a hike, baby.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.370
Just this one thing.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.683
- All right, do what you got to do, Romeo.
- BETH: Zach!

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.001
Do what you got to do,
but be at the Levine' at 1600, all right?

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.082
- Zach.
- You know when that is? It's 4:00 p.m.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.527
- Do what you got to do.
- Kyle.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.601
- Do what you got to do.
- Kyle!

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.887
- Do what you got to do.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.600
White Lightning Strike, this is Red Dog
Leader. Briar Grave's a 47.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.763
- MAN: (ON RADIO) What's a 47 again?
- All clear, man. Come on.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.281
ZACH: Hey!

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.446
BETH; Hiking.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.522
(SMOOTH JAZZ CONTINUES PLAYING)

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.971
- It's pretty.
- It's beautiful.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.610
Pretty!

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.490
(SNARLING)

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.043
Don't do that, okay?

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.529
Smell.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.366
Lavender!

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.570
Yeah. Yeah, it's really soothing.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.807
Wow.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.002
You were right.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.931
- It's a really beautiful view.
- (GROWLING)

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.762
I wish we could flamenco dance.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.208
Flamenco dance.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.281
Um...

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.887
But we got to do a lot of things.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.681
And I never got to say goodbye to you,

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.651
but at least I get to now.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.408
Oh, fuck! I can't...

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.444
I can't do this. This fucking sucks.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.921
Why? I thought you liked it.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.764
No, I do. It's not...

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.083
This is not the... Not the hike.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.768
Look, you were right, okay? Hey.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.241
Hey-

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.244
Thank you

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.365
for coming back

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.320
and for giving me a second chance.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.041
I, um...

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.685
I'm sorry the whole world went to shit.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:09.085
But it was totally worth it,
and I'm sorry if I screwed everything up.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.290
No, no. No.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.361
I, uh...

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.762
I'll always love you, Beth.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.845
Forever.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:38.004
I love you too, Zach.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.806
Good bye.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.769
Where are you going?

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.048
- ZACH: Hi, Mr. Levin.
- All right, you made it. Good. Come on.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.480
You hungry? We got bagels.
They're frozen, but they're good.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.609
Uh, no, I'm fine.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.251
Mom! Dad!

- JUDY: Zachery?
- Mom!

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.491
Oh, my God. Zach, my baby. Oh!

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.450
- NOAH: Oh, you okay?
- I missed you guys so much.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.403
- Oh, my God, are you hurt?
- There's blood all over your shirt.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.801
Yeah, it's Beth's.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.201
- Okay, so thank God you're okay.
- Yeah.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.805
I love you guys so much.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.240
Oh, honey, we're so sorry we didn't
believe you about the monsters.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.049
- We didn't know.
- I know. It's okay. It's okay.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.645
It's just really good to see you.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.085
- That's going to come off.
- My shirt's a mess.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.491
Hey, come here. Look who's here.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.081
Huh?

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.450
JUDY: Zach.
ZACH: Oh.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.201
Hi.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.284
I stuck a tent pole through my Nana's head.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.045
She's a bit traumatized,
but she'll be okay.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.531
Doesn't she look good?

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.810
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right?

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.211
Where's Kyle?

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.767
Right here. 1600. You made it.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.444
Punctual.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.851
That's good.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.211
I did what I had to do.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.650
Where's my Desert Eagle? I thought you
were gonna give my Desert Eagle back.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.291
- Oh, well, I tossed it into the ravine.
- Why?

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.601
- I need my gun.
- I thought you guys had bazookas and shit.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.523
You're such an asshole.
That cost me a lot of money.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.840
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I used it to murder my girlfriend.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.600
I didn't really feel like holding on to it.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.170
Hey, look, we need to
focus on what is next.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.810
- Exactly.
- All right.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.645
Everybody, listen up.
I've got some provisions.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.291
I think we need to get far away from here
where the zombies can't get to us.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.488
We cleared this sector, Zach.
We're safe here. Don't worry about it.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.641
- Like where?
- ZACH: Machu Picchu.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.926
- Macho what?
- JUDY: Where's that?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.162
- Zach, we cleared the sector.
- Kyle, stop interrupting your brother.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.725
- Act your age.
- Macho what?

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.201
Machu Picchu. It's remote and safe.
Look, I've got a map.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.408
I think if we take side streets
and sidewalks

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.641
- along the I-5...
