10:14.213 --> 10:16.449

10:16.515 --> 10:19.452

of Bubble Kitty.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.020
Meow!

10:21.087 --> 10:24.123
(Bubble Kitty meowing)

10:24.190 --> 10:25.691
Come on, Bubble Kitty.

10:25.758 --> 10:30.396
Here's a ball of yarn
for you to play with.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.365
(Meowing)

10:32.431 --> 10:34.700
Aw, what's the matter,
Bubble Kitty?

10:34.767 --> 10:36.702
Don't you wanna play?

10:36.769 --> 10:39.305
(Sneezing)

10:42.041 --> 10:43.943
Poor Bubble Kitty.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.644
She's really sad.

10:45.711 --> 10:49.181
Mr. Grouper, I think Bubble
Kitty misses her home.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.617
I think you're right, Oona.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.986
Maybe we can help her
find her owner!

10:54.053 --> 10:55.788
That's a good idea!

10:55.855 --> 10:57.289
Hey, Goby?

10:57.356 --> 10:59.458
May we use the picture
you just drew?

10:59.525 --> 11:00.993
Okay!

11:01.060 --> 11:03.329
Let's make this into a poster.

11:03.396 --> 11:07.133
We can hang it up to let people
know that we found Bubble Kitty!

11:07.199 --> 11:10.202
Yeah!

11:07.199 --> 11:10.202
{\an3}Good idea!

11:10.269 --> 11:11.971
I'll put my phone number on it

11:12.038 --> 11:14.273

can call us.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.075
Hey, guys, would you please
hang this up

11:16.142 --> 11:17.910

A reserve is a place where
animals live to stay safe.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.139
<i>Three baby cats are lost</i>

12:20.206 --> 12:22.508
<i>You must go get them</i>

12:22.575 --> 12:25.177

12:25.244 --> 12:27.179
We're on it!

<i>But watch out for</i>

12:31.217 --> 12:33.219

Uh-oh.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.287
{\an5}<i>DEEMA:</i>

12:43.496 --> 12:45.397
Look!
A baby lion.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.832
There you are, kitty!

12:46.899 --> 12:48.033

12:48.100 --> 12:51.303
Let's get you back home,
kitten.

12:51.370 --> 12:54.106
Babies of big cats
are called cubs.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.387
Let's get out of here!

13:14.994 --> 13:16.262
That was close!

13:16.328 --> 13:18.097
We need to find
a lost tiger cub

13:18.164 --> 13:20.866
before the Cat Burglar
shows up again!

13:20.933 --> 13:22.635
Tigers live in India!

13:22.701 --> 13:24.470
Let's go!

13:24.537 --> 13:26.138
<i>So the cat herders went</i>

13:26.205 --> 13:29.742
<i>to find the missing tiger cub.</i>

13:29.808 --> 13:33.479
Hmmm, I wonder where we should
look for the tiger cub.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.283
Well, tigers like to swim.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.984

13:39.051 --> 13:40.886
Look!

<i>So the cat herders got away</i>

14:15.154 --> 14:16.655
We need to find the last cub

14:16.722 --> 14:19.491
before the Cat Burglar
catches up with us!

14:19.558 --> 14:22.494
The last cub is a jaguar cub.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.463
Hey, jaguars live in Peru!

14:24.530 --> 14:26.432
We're already here!

14:26.498 --> 14:28.801
That worked out nicely!

14:28.867 --> 14:30.836
(Baby jaguar roaring)

14:30.903 --> 14:32.605
I just heard him!

14:32.671 --> 14:34.273
Meow!

14:34.340 --> 14:38.877
We need your help to find
the jaguar cub!

14:38.944 --> 14:41.313
Jaguars like to climb!

14:41.380 --> 14:43.816
Should we look for the jaguar
cub by the lake,

14:43.882 --> 14:46.318
in the meadow,

14:46.385 --> 14:50.322
or in the jungle?

14:50.389 --> 14:52.258
FISH:
In the jungle!

14:52.324 --> 14:53.892
Yeah!

14:53.959 --> 14:56.528
There are lots of trees for the
jaguar to climb in the jungle!

14:56.595 --> 14:59.431
CAT BURGLAR:
Here kitty, kitty, kitty!

14:59.498 --> 15:01.967
Oh, no!
The Cat Burglar's coming!

15:02.034 --> 15:04.436

15:19.952 --> 15:21.086

15:22.721 --> 15:26.759
CAT BURGLAR:

15:26.825 --> 15:30.963
Oh, no!
We're trapped!

15:31.030 --> 15:32.431
What are we going to do?

15:32.498 --> 15:34.933
Here, kitty.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.669
Meow!

15:36.735 --> 15:39.505
Aw, listen to his little roar!

15:39.571 --> 15:42.241

15:42.308 --> 15:45.044
It's your daddy,

15:45.110 --> 15:46.612
Meow!

15:46.679 --> 15:49.782

15:49.848 --> 15:52.151
That scared me!

15:52.217 --> 15:53.485
(Sobbing)

15:53.552 --> 15:55.988
Well, it's not nice
to chase people.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.723
{\an3}Or cubs!

15:57.790 --> 16:01.493
I just wanted to pet
the little kitties!

16:01.560 --> 16:03.829
(Cat Burglar sobbing)

16:03.896 --> 16:06.665
I have an idea!

16:06.732 --> 16:08.701
<i>And so, the cat herders</i>
<i>got all of the cubs</i>

16:08.767 --> 16:10.803
<i>back to the big cat reserve,</i>

16:10.869 --> 16:13.539
<i>and the Cat Burglar</i>
<i>got a new job.</i>

16:13.605 --> 16:16.875
Okay, Cat Burglar, your job
is to keep the cats safe

16:16.942 --> 16:20.179
by making sure they don't wander
out of the reserve.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.114
I'm a cat herder!
Woo!

to thank your puppy.

(Giggling)

21:06.898 --> 21:08.300
What were you doing
way up here?

21:08.367 --> 21:10.502
Oh!
You wanna see?

21:10.569 --> 21:12.471
I was working on this:

21:12.537 --> 21:17.142
Presenting some of the greatest
cats in the world!

21:17.209 --> 21:18.577
The leopard!

21:41.366 --> 21:43.368
BUBBLE KITTY:
Meow!

21:45.103 --> 21:48.540
I'm so glad we got Bubble Kitty
back where she belongs.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.410
And those big cats
were so cool!

21:51.476 --> 21:53.311
(Roaring)

21:53.378 --> 21:55.480
What was that?

21:55.547 --> 21:59.017
That sounds like a jaguar.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.852
Gilly, look!

22:00.919 --> 22:02.421
Bubble Puppy.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.323

You can come down.
