WEBVTT

00:13.114 --> 00:15.649
Oh, man! The ball rolled
under the fence!

00:15.683 --> 00:17.185
Go get it, Scott.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.486
No way!
That's quicksand!

00:22.290 --> 00:25.526
If you go, we'll let you play
"German soldier-girl prisoners"

00:25.559 --> 00:27.128
with us again.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.129
Okay.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.833
- 'Whoa!'
- Scott!

00:32.866 --> 00:34.034
(Scott)
'Help me!'

00:34.835 --> 00:36.604
[theme music]

01:14.342 --> 01:16.444
(female on loudspeaker)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

01:16.477 --> 01:20.714
'Reminder. It's Saturday, which
is not alright for fighting.'

01:20.748 --> 01:22.683
'Repeat, not alright.'

01:22.716 --> 01:26.120
Oh, I hate the weekends.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.688
It's so lonely.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.723
(male #1)
'I've got a live one here!'

01:29.757 --> 01:31.559
I got a thirteen-year-old
sinking in quicksand.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.594
I managed to isolate
the quicksand around him

01:33.627 --> 01:36.664
and then put it in this trough,
but there's not much time.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.898
Who's going to
treat him?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.533
Doctors don't work
on the weekend!

01:39.567 --> 01:41.869
He will sink by Monday!

01:41.902 --> 01:46.474
I'm just gonna have to call
the team back together again.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.376
The team?

01:48.409 --> 01:49.677
[screaming]

01:52.213 --> 01:53.814
Get me Cat Black
on the phone.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.483
[phone ringing]

01:55.516 --> 01:57.885
(female narrator)
 We are all tested.

01:57.918 --> 02:01.255
This better be good, Sy.
It's the weekend.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.790
Quicksand?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.325
I'll be right in.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.394
Eventually,
 our number comes up.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.795
Quicksand? Crap!

02:08.829 --> 02:13.401
I'll be right there.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.369
Someday, we all get the call.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.538
Phone for you,
Mr. Childrens.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.608
Sy Mittleman,
from the hospital.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.343
I knew this day would come.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.744
Tell them,
I'll be right in.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.792
I'm in a Tron-like world
right now, Sy. What's up?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.228
Quicksand?

02:40.261 --> 02:42.596
Be right there.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.766
No, I don't know any Sy.
You must have the wrong number.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.502
What? Sy?
Give me that.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.338
Sy, this better be good.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.472
It's the Sabbath.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.673
Oh, that is good.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.608
It doesn't matter who you are.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.444
This city needs a hero.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.612
With great power
 comes great responsi--

02:58.646 --> 03:00.348
[phone ringing]

03:00.381 --> 03:02.250
Oh! Got to get that.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.417
Hello?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.818
Oh, hey, Sy.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.655
No, I'm not busy.
Yeah. See you soon.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.758
It takes all kinds of people.
 Butchers, bakers

03:10.791 --> 03:13.927
even seashell shellers,
 seashell sellers.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.463
Seashell sellers.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.299
Seasell sheller.
God.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.933
Oh, hold on.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.702
It's Sy. Can we reschedule?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.537
- Well, we're in the midd--
- Hey, listen!

03:23.571 --> 03:25.773
I am a doctor,
and I don't have time

03:25.806 --> 03:27.608
to argue
with a voice-over coach!

03:27.641 --> 03:28.709
Seashell seller.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.877
[upbeat music]

03:39.753 --> 03:41.555
Quicksand,
our old nemesis.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.825
Just once I'd like a kid brought
in a trough full of quicksand

03:44.858 --> 03:47.261
and put one in the win column
for "us."

03:47.295 --> 03:48.929
Where's Lola?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.365
I'll be super-pissed
if she's in a Tron-like world.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.567
Who cares where she is?
She's pretty dumb.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.436
Dori, you go and find her

03:55.469 --> 03:57.405
and check
every voice-over coach in town.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.340
I hear that's what
she's doing, nowadays.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.808
(Valarie thinking)
 Lola's doing voice-overs?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.676
Son of a bitch.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.578
No, Mom.
I have to go.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.013
There's an emergency
at the hospital

04:06.046 --> 04:08.516
and I can't find
my stupid phone.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.419
What's that?

04:11.452 --> 04:14.622
Duh. You're the best,
mom, and I'm an idiot.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.824
I'll see you
and Phil on Sunday. Love you.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.661
(Valarie)
'Who is that chick?'

04:21.695 --> 04:23.864
- Is that Dori?
- Yeah.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.499
Wow, she's gotten
really fat, huh?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.401
'Especially,
the last nine months.'

04:27.435 --> 04:30.070
That is a very significant
abdominal protrusion.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.506
It's starting to give me
a very significant protrusion

04:32.540 --> 04:34.675
and I'm not talking
about my abdomen.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.510
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

04:36.544 --> 04:37.978
Yes.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.380
What?

04:39.413 --> 04:41.014
You don't know.
It's my wiener.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.850
- I know!
- Let's go talk to her.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.485
(Chief)
Come on, people!

04:44.518 --> 04:46.787
We're running out of time!
We need ideas!

04:46.820 --> 04:48.656
We could just pull him out.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.090
That'll break
all his bones, doi!

04:50.123 --> 04:52.326
We could send somebody in,
to get him.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.961
Work our way up
through the basement.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.730
We don't have time
for that! Think! Oh, hey!

04:56.764 --> 04:59.800
We can put kitty litter in there
to neutralize the quicksand.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.370
The couch cushions in my office.
They've got kitty litter.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.538
- We could use those.
- Great.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.608
Wait, does it matter if there's
cat poop already in the litter?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.443
- Mm, shouldn't.
- Okay.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.878
It's like a significant
amount, though.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.012
- Shouldn't.
- Okay, just..

05:12.045 --> 05:13.714
Where is Lola?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.883
This is her specialty,
this kinda thing!

05:15.916 --> 05:18.486
[whispers]
Lola, where are you?

05:22.590 --> 05:24.124
Oh, I should totally get gas.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.960
Don't want to run out
on the way to the hospital.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.897
That would slow things
down a little.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.366
- Lola?
- Greg.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.502
You never returned
any of my calls.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.636
My phone was sick.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.904
How are you?

05:36.937 --> 05:40.641
Still tall
and really pretty, I see.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.412
- I gotta go.
- Oh, I miss my Lola!

05:44.445 --> 05:46.046
I think about you
all the time.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.482
- Did you read my book?
- You wrote a book?

05:48.516 --> 05:49.617
In my head.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.485
How could I
have read that?

05:51.519 --> 05:53.454
My whole family
committed suicide!

05:53.487 --> 05:54.688
Are you drunk?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.457
- I was last night.
- Oh.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.692
- And also now.
- Mm.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.628
I don't know what's going on.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.062
One minute,
I was normal sized.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.698
And then boom,
nine months later, I was fat.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.034
Do you remember doing
anything out of the ordinary

06:07.067 --> 06:09.470
like putting fatty foods
in your mouth or vagina?

06:09.503 --> 06:12.172
No. I can't keep anything
down or up.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.008
I have been spending weekends
at an opium den having sex

06:15.042 --> 06:16.644
with a lot of sailors, though.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.446
Well, that's not nothing.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.081
I mean, opium dens are hotbeds
for really toxic materials

06:21.114 --> 06:24.685
like rodent droppings, dander,
all sorts of DNA.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.420
And the obvious, of course.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.988
- Opium.
- Karate instructors.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.594
Dori, I'm gonna find out
what happened to you, and I bet

06:33.627 --> 06:36.830
the answer is somehow linked
to my boner that won't go away.

06:36.864 --> 06:40.568
The kitty litter in this couch
cushion is pretty urine-soaked.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.470
Yeah, well,
tell me about it.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.738
It's from my pee couch.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.540
The quicksand is hardening.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.808
It's keeping him
from sinking.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.843
Gentlemen...I think,
we did it.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.879
[laughing]

06:51.912 --> 06:52.980
[groaning]

06:53.013 --> 06:55.483
No.
We didn't.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.718
The hardening quicksand
is compressing his organs.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.152
Would have been
better off sinking.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.621
Damn it!

07:00.654 --> 07:02.790
Put some water on there,
loosen it up. Stat!

07:02.823 --> 07:05.559
Blake, you find anything
in those old quicksand files?

07:05.593 --> 07:08.028
Nothing here, no story,
no sense of continuity.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.197
Interchangeable characters.
Mostly, lot of bathroom jokes.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.232
Ugh, this water's
making me have to pee.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.734
I'll be on my couch.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.769
Come on, Lola!
Where the heck are you?

07:15.803 --> 07:17.538
We need you here.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.573
What are you doing right now?

07:19.607 --> 07:22.776
We need you with us...
to help us do this thing!

07:25.579 --> 07:27.147
So where are you?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.583
Do you want to come
back to my apartment

07:29.617 --> 07:30.751
and read my journal?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.185
Okay, okay.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.522
Okay, well,
I gotta go.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.524
Will you tickle my back?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.694
Kyah!

07:40.728 --> 07:42.229
Ugh!

07:42.262 --> 07:43.664
Seashell seller.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.135
[intense music]

07:48.168 --> 07:50.871
Oh, my God!
I totally forgot to get gas!

07:54.074 --> 07:56.243
[intense music]

08:17.798 --> 08:18.866
[music continues]

08:28.175 --> 08:30.911
I figured it out!
You're pregnant.

08:30.944 --> 08:31.979
Pregnant?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.547
Did I stutter?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.815
[screaming]

08:34.847 --> 08:37.618
That explains my mood swings.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.986
And that explains my boner.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.621
How did you know?

08:40.654 --> 08:42.255
Well, you mentioned
you'd been having sex

08:42.289 --> 08:43.890
with strangers
in an opium den.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.926
- That could make you pregnant.
- No kidding.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.761
If I'm right,
that would indicate

08:47.795 --> 08:50.831
that there will be a newborn
baby coming out of your vagina

08:50.864 --> 08:52.733
at any moment.

08:52.766 --> 08:56.103
Oh, my God! I hope my baby's
not a karate instructor.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.905
Oh, it didn't say anything
about that.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.679
I'm calling it.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.049
(male #1)
'Lola!'

09:09.082 --> 09:10.784
Smash!

09:10.818 --> 09:12.820
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch out! Don't do anything!

09:20.628 --> 09:22.162
[hooting and cheering]

09:22.195 --> 09:23.363
Yes!

09:23.396 --> 09:24.998
'Yes!'

09:25.032 --> 09:27.100
I knew you would know
what to do.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.903
But for reals,
where were you, Lola?

09:29.937 --> 09:33.741
Well, let's just say..

09:33.774 --> 09:36.710
...I was decapitating
my ex-boyfriend Greg.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.378
Oh!

09:38.411 --> 09:40.781
Oh, snap!

09:40.814 --> 09:42.015
'You didn't!
Yes, you did!'

09:42.049 --> 09:43.784
Same Lola,
different day.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.619
[Lindsay Rae Spurlock singing
 "As for Now"]

09:45.653 --> 09:46.954
* Hey, you

09:46.987 --> 09:48.388
* Where have you been?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.957
* I could've sworn

09:49.990 --> 09:52.059
* That we were
more than friends *

09:52.092 --> 09:53.894
(Blake)
I was in a Tron-like world.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.798
* Because I saw something
in you *

10:00.167 --> 10:03.971
* And you saw something
in me *

10:04.004 --> 10:07.040
Quicksand?
Crap!

10:07.074 --> 10:10.177
I'll be right there.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.745
* And it's over

10:11.779 --> 10:13.814
* So as for now

10:13.847 --> 10:16.884
* We're just friends

10:16.917 --> 10:18.652
* We're just friends

10:24.191 --> 10:26.927
(female narrator)
 Next week
 on Childrens Hospital

10:26.960 --> 10:29.797
I'm not gonna lie. It doesn't
look good for your son.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.431
- Oh, God.
- I'm just playing with you.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.800
- What?
- I was lying.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.267
So my son's
gonna be okay?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.970
No. I was lying 'bout saying
I'm not gonna lie.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.405
Will he be okay
or not?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.273
Never know with me,
you know?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.009
(male on loudspeaker)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

10:42.042 --> 10:45.345
'Follow me on Twitter,
@attentionstaff.'

10:45.378 --> 10:46.847
'That is all.'
