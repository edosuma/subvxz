00:02.044 --> 00:04.755
[Sylvia] Client of mine,
Raul Arraya, one of these days,

00:04.839 --> 00:06.966
his boys are bound to pay you a visit.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.300
[grunts]

00:10.010 --> 00:13.013
A few months ago,
the bodies of Carl Rogers and Gwen Keating

00:13.097 --> 00:14.640
were found in a shipping container.

00:14.724 --> 00:15.683
[gunfire]

00:15.766 --> 00:17.184
We'd like to know
what you were doing there.

00:17.268 --> 00:18.519
You and Bosch.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.520
Harry Bosch.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.063
[Harry] So you can put
your subpoena on the table

00:21.147 --> 00:23.399
and you can go shag ass away from my crib.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.818
There's no way
Matthew is talking to the Feds.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.153
I know for a fact he is.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.279
Should I fire him?

00:28.362 --> 00:29.321
We might be able to use him.

00:30.656 --> 00:31.574
What do you want?

00:31.657 --> 00:33.325
What the fuck do you think we want?

00:33.409 --> 00:36.287
David Foster, you're under arrest
for the murder of Lexi Parks.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.997
- [Louise] David.
- Call Honey Chandler.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.875
So you wanna tell me
where you were and with whom?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.127
James Allen. He's my dealer.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.044
[man] What is it?

00:44.128 --> 00:46.422
Nothing to worry
your pretty little head about.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.467
- [Reina] How's crew?
- Love it.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.469
Just dying of boredom.

[dramatic music playing]

01:52.363 --> 01:53.364
It's all yours.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.960
Don't worry about those scratches.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.837
We'll take care of it.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.588
Where shall I send your security deposit?

02:09.672 --> 02:12.758
Just let me know when it's ready.
I'll stop by the office, pick it up.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.055
Sorry for your trouble here.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.141
[dramatic music playing]

03:17.072 --> 03:19.074
- What's your hurry?
- Get a grip, Dad.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.784
It's not like I'm moving cross country.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.661
I still think you're making a mistake.

03:22.745 --> 03:26.165
Yeah. I know you do.
But it's mine to make.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.291
It's just...

03:28.751 --> 03:30.711
I mean, what's the rush?
It's only been a few months.

03:30.794 --> 03:34.506
It's high time.
I--I need my own place, Dad.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.008
This is your perch. I'm underfoot.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.052
No, it's not. It's your home.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.392
You be a good boy?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.062
Take care of your old man?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.567
I'm worried about you.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.319
I'm worried about you.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.698
I love you, Mads.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.824
I love you.

04:02.952 --> 04:03.869
Get the fuck out of here.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.921
[dramatic music playing]

04:22.638 --> 04:24.807
Yeah, I know. It's just you and me, boy.

[Lexi] The City of West Hollywood
prioritizes public safety,

05:33.125 --> 05:37.046
first and foremost,
without sacrificing tolerance,

05:37.129 --> 05:40.758
diversity, quality of life,
or neighborhood sustainability.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.135
Out of an abundance of caution,

05:43.218 --> 05:48.515
the city council has decided to cancel
the 2021 Halloween Carnival.

05:48.599 --> 05:52.227
Protecting public safety
and health is paramount.

05:52.311 --> 05:56.440
We hope to bring this vibrant
and creative event back next year.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.361
[Harry]
What was Lexi like to work with?

06:01.445 --> 06:06.158
People underestimated her
because she was pretty, petite.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.869
But she got shit done.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.746
Did she have any enemies?

06:10.829 --> 06:15.000
Just the usual disgruntled constituents.
Nothing she worried about.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.295
Nothing worth killing her over.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.381
[phone rings and vibrates]

06:23.258 --> 06:24.134
Chandler?

06:24.218 --> 06:27.054
I've hit a wall with my alibi witness,
James Allen.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.473
- Number didn't pan out?
- [Honey] I've called and called.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.517
No answer. Voicemail's full.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.644
He's a dealer. Probably has priors.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.480
[Honey] Along those lines,
I asked Mo to do some digging.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.525
He found a booking number
from an older rep.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.568
Text it to me.
I can use it to get a last known.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.822
Coming your way. Thanks, Harry.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.657
How about that face to face
with your client?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.033
Working on it.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.377
Bosch, got a minute?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.586
Do I need a rep?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.713
Might if you don't come with me right now.

07:01.797 --> 07:02.714
Let's go.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.095
What's this about?

07:08.178 --> 07:09.721
Sarge wants to talk to you.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.640
About what?

07:11.723 --> 07:12.850
Didn't say.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.518
Am I in trouble?

07:15.477 --> 07:16.728
About to find out.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.694
- Officer Bosch.
- Sergeant.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.196
Good work on that bracelet.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.198
The burglary detectives
were most impressed.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.158
Thank you.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.993
[Sgt. Edgewood] Vasquez has been
singing your praises, too.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.537
I may have laid it on a little thick.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.498
[Sgt. Edgewood]
There's an opening in our unit,

07:36.582 --> 07:37.957
and I've been looking
for the right person to fill it.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.878
- Seriously?
- Interested?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.672
Will--will Vasquez and I be partners?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.966
[Sgt. Edgewood] Well, she did draw
the short straw.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.677
[Reina] Somebody has to protect the public
from Mad Dog Police.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.221
Can I think about it?

07:51.305 --> 07:53.182
I thought you said
she was chomping at the bit.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.058
- Thought so, too.
- [Maddie] No. I--I am. I am.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.186
Chomp-chomp, when do I start?

07:57.269 --> 07:59.563
[laughs] Welcome to the team.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.776
He was 19, scared to death.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.071
I knew his parents
and took the case pro bono and...

08:08.739 --> 08:10.991
...got the charges reduced
to misdemeanor possession,

08:11.074 --> 08:13.076
got David into a program.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.748
He turned his life around, I thought.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.752
And now all this
and, uh, it's a freaking nightmare.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.049
What else is keeping you up nights?

08:28.592 --> 08:31.178
[sighs]

08:31.261 --> 08:33.096
The other night at meditation.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.644
How's it going, the meditation?

08:38.727 --> 08:39.895
It's helping, I think.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.020
Go on.

08:43.190 --> 08:47.152
I caught this guy watching me
and he came up after and made small talk,

08:48.403 --> 08:50.197
introduced himself.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.449
Was he hitting on you?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.533
I don't know.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.870
A little maybe.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.623
How'd it make you feel?

08:59.706 --> 09:02.793
Annoyed, angry.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.046
Say more.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.549
I like that place.
I mean, I wanna go back.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.678
I shouldn't have to deal with...

09:14.471 --> 09:15.347
With?

09:15.430 --> 09:19.101
Attention, flirtation, you know,
the dance, whatever.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.563
Maybe just wants conversation.

09:24.690 --> 09:25.899
Why would you say that?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.195
Don't predetermine the outcome.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.032
No, thank you. Not interested.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.243
In him or in general?

09:36.326 --> 09:38.412
Either, both.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.123
Then we should talk about that.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.083
No, you fucking talk about it.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.639
Hello.

09:57.723 --> 09:58.724
Sorry to bother you.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.018
I'm looking for James Allen.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.936
- Who are you?
- My name is Harry Bosch.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.772
I'm a private investigator. You're Miss...

10:05.856 --> 10:07.649
Allen, his sister.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.987
Well, I just wanna ask him
a few questions. Is he around?

10:13.530 --> 10:14.906
James is dead.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.617
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.412
When did this happen?

10:20.996 --> 10:22.748
Couple of days ago, I guess.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.834
Two detectives came by
the house last night.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.920
They--they said his body was found
in an alley in Hollywood.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.090
They didn't know exactly how long
he'd been there.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.342
Did they know what happened?

10:34.176 --> 10:35.886
They think probably an overdose.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.014
Not such a surprise, the life he lived.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.351
These two detectives,
did they leave you a card?

10:43.477 --> 10:46.438
I have it inside. One minute.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.981
[Harry] Thank you.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.738
- [door closes]
- [line ringing]

10:55.989 --> 10:58.700
Chandler, Bosch. Call me.

11:03.705 --> 11:08.210
[Honey] Mr. Arraya is currently
incarcerated here at Terminal Island.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.212

11:10.295 --> 11:11.546
[man] What a coincidence.

11:11.630 --> 11:15.217
[Honey] One of these days,
his boys are bound to pay you a visit.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.637
- [man] Why would they do that?
- [Honey] Raul owes me a favor.

11:21.807 --> 11:24.184
Shortly after Willie Datz was murdered,

11:24.267 --> 11:26.478
you did meet with Honey Chandler.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.063
[Raul]
You taped that conversation, too?

11:28.146 --> 11:30.941
Of course not.
Attorney-client, it was privileged.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.944
And you always follow the rules.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.612
Did she call in that favor?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.490
Yeah. She saved your life.
It's a pretty heavy debt.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.033
[sighs]

11:40.117 --> 11:41.993
I'm gonna tell you all one thing.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.371
It was a bluff.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.956
She bluffed Datz.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.542
He fingered the Russians,
got himself killed.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.919
So you did not stick your boys on him?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.338
Didn't have to.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.757
Some Russian stooge shanked him in
the shower.

11:55.841 --> 11:56.716
The day room?

11:56.800 --> 11:59.511
- Not one of yours.
- [Raul] Asked and answered.

11:59.594 --> 12:03.056
[Maddie] When Chandler did come
to see you, what did you talk about?

12:03.140 --> 12:05.559
- You mostly.
- Me?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.644
You Feds.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.606
How you were all up in her business
looking at her for debts.

12:11.690 --> 12:15.110
Suborning murder, or conspiracy,
or some shit.

12:15.193 --> 12:18.572
She even wanted to know
if I had anything to do with Datz.

12:18.655 --> 12:22.409
Like I went off the reservation
and took it upon myself to, you know...

12:22.492 --> 12:24.578
[chuckles] Repay the debt.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.662
Did you?

12:25.745 --> 12:29.332
[Raul] What part of no snitching
don't you motherfuckers understand?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.855
- That's it?
- We're up on his phone.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.233
- And he won't know?
- You'd have to be me to figure it out.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.610
Shit's undetectable.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.988
And this gives us total access?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.740
[Mo]
Emails, texts, calls, everything.

13:02.866 --> 13:06.453
- You're a genius.
- Man, Sonny Rollins is a genius.

striving for excellence.

- Aloha.
- [chuckling]

13:17.923 --> 13:19.966
- I appreciate you coming, mate.
- Yeah.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.344
Well, I appreciate you picking up
the check.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.137
I'll bet you do.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.348
I--I just wanna check
and see how Maddie's doing.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.600
Oh, she's doing aces.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.561
I mean, this whole stolen bracelet caper,

13:31.645 --> 13:34.689

13:34.773 --> 13:36.942
Tenacious. Like her old man.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.735
Bracelet caper?

13:38.818 --> 13:42.364
- Oh, she didn't tell you?
- Well, we've both been busy.

13:42.447 --> 13:46.243
Right. Well, she impressed
the right people.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.870
For a P1 to snag a spot in CRU,

13:48.954 --> 13:50.872
oh, that's a big deal.

13:50.956 --> 13:51.957
Huge.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.210
I mean, you gotta be proud.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.670
As can be.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.511
[door clicking]

14:07.973 --> 14:10.225
- How'd you do?
- [Rico] Five miles.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.477
- Hmm.
- Barely broke a sweat.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.271
What are you up to?

14:15.897 --> 14:18.191
I'm working on my victim impact statement.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.111
How's it going?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.154
Nowhere fast.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.365
[sighs] Mind if I take a look?

14:31.162 --> 14:33.373
"Four months ago,
my life changed forever."

14:34.915 --> 14:36.042
That's a start.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.877
Why am I even doing this?

14:39.087 --> 14:40.547
What does it matter?

14:41.256 --> 14:43.592
It's supposed to be good for you.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.801
Like lancing a boil.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.512
That's what my dad says.

14:47.929 --> 14:48.847
You don't think so?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.308
I mean, I survived.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.436
He's going to prison.
That's all that matters.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.231
You don't have to do this.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.900
Your choice.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.697
I just wanna turn the page.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.410
You know what you need?

15:10.493 --> 15:11.536
[Maddie] What?

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
What are you doing?

15:13.663 --> 15:14.706
What's it look like?

15:15.749 --> 15:16.791
You making pancakes?

15:16.875 --> 15:19.169
- Cheer you up.
- Well, screw that.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.086
You don't want pancakes?

15:20.170 --> 15:21.713
No. It's a great idea.
We should just go there.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.383
[laughs]

15:32.724 --> 15:35.852
[Harry] So this case you're working,
a Lexi Parks murder.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.520
That woman in West Hollywood.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.191
We're representing the accused,
David Foster.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.734
What's your client got to do with our vic?

15:42.817 --> 15:47.656
Your vic, James Allen, is my guy's alibi.

15:47.739 --> 15:51.242
According to Foster, they were together
the night Lexi Parks was murdered.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.038
Allen's sister seems to be
under the impression that her brother

15:55.121 --> 15:56.498
died from a drug overdose.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.292
We may have given her that impression.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.794
That was before the autopsy.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.922
Ligature strangulation with a wire.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.383
Might be connected
to an earlier murder we're also working.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.510
Another male prostitute dumped
in an alley.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.553
Same MO, could be a serial.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.181
I think you buried the lede.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.102
So, James Allen was a prostitute?

16:17.185 --> 16:21.356
Sex worker, male escort,
number of priors for solicitation.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.192
Did you find his phone?

16:24.901 --> 16:27.028
No, unfortunately.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.407
Well, that's his client list, right?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.741
- His calendar?
- We know.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.703
Okay, young-blood.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.372
You let me know if you find it.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.375
Later.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.878
[helicopter blade whirring]

16:46.339 --> 16:47.632
Condescending know-it-all.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.551
The same old Bosch.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.181
[indistinct chatter]

16:59.144 --> 17:00.895
No more riding the front desk.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.606
How does it feel?

17:03.690 --> 17:07.193
Hmm, like I won the lottery.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.367
What about you, though?
I bet you can't wait to get back to work.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.788
You are coming back, yes?

17:18.872 --> 17:22.250
I don't know. It depends on the day.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.919
How much my neck and back
hurts when I get out of bed.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.422
My mom has it her way or I'd never set
foot in a police station again.

17:27.505 --> 17:30.800
Yeah. My dad had his druthers,
I'd be running the desk until I retired.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.385
[laughter]

17:32.469 --> 17:34.012
He knows about your new assignment?

17:35.680 --> 17:36.723
He might freak.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.143
But get over it.

17:42.312 --> 17:46.191
All right. To Maddie,
better bring your A-game, Boo.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.067
Don't call me Boo.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.613
- Fair enough.
- To Maddie.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.323
[woman] Hear, hear.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.577
Hmm.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.624
So much for David's alibi.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.167
Not to mention the DNA.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.002
Yeah. We're gonna need to cast doubt
on that.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.797
What? It--it's a frame?
Somebody planted it?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.591
That's possible.
I mean, you said so yourself.

18:11.674 --> 18:12.842
Their paths have never crossed.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.260
Well, as far as we know.

18:14.344 --> 18:18.056
What we do know for a fact
is David Foster, our client, is a liar.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.809
A man with a secret life
who wanted it kept secret?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.686
Sounds like the first
line in your opening.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.899
[Honey] A liar, an adulterer,
an addict, not a murderer.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.108
Can't wait to meet him.

18:29.192 --> 18:33.112
[Honey] Well, tomorrow, attorney-client
visit with an investigator in tow.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.072
Fine.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.865
What about our other problem?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.326
Mo has been up on Matthew's phone.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.494
Radio silence.

18:39.577 --> 18:40.745
Should we be worried?

18:40.829 --> 18:42.205
Concerned.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.169
[ominous music playing]

19:01.683 --> 19:03.768
Lawyer's in the dining room
having drinks with some guy.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.646
- Who?
- Seems like a cop to me.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.565
- [man] Hey.
- Carries himself like a cop.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.150
- [man] Get out of here!
- [horn honking]

19:13.528 --> 19:16.030
Believe-- these zombie fucks
make me puke.

19:16.114 --> 19:19.242
Hey. Could you spare a buck
so I could get something to eat?

19:19.325 --> 19:20.285
Get outta here.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.455
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Okay. Okay.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.625
God--God bless you. Have a good evening.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.142
Look at this fuckin' guy.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.061
Oh, hey, stay--stay in the car.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.439
[Detective Ellis] Hey, pal?
Hey. Come here.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.524
- I got something for you.
- [man] Oh, God bless.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.218
You're gonna pop an aneurysm.
You know that, right?

20:19.302 --> 20:21.262
The world's gone to shit.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.890
[man] There you go, sir.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.142
All right. That'll be $10.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.103
[man]
There you go. All right.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.691
[man]
That's him, the guy she was with.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.902
Yeah. Let me go take a closer look.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.342
Blue Jeep Cherokee.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.259
Classic.

21:00.343 --> 21:01.886
[Detective Ellis] Classic shit box.

21:01.970 --> 21:02.887
It's a collector's item.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.932
You stay on him and you take
the shit box. I'll stay on the lawyer.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.017
[car engine turns over]

21:11.187 --> 21:14.190
[suspenseful music playing]

21:41.134 --> 21:43.886
We have the schematic
of the container the bodies were found in.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.805
We could tie it to Rose & Associates.

21:48.099 --> 21:51.644
We have Bosch and Chandler
at the port at the same time.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.313
Bosch and his associates at the pipeline.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.190
Still need to prove it.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.943
It's enough for a search warrant.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.612
Not quite, but we're getting there.

22:02.363 --> 22:06.534
Chandler. She fucking fed Rogers
to the Russians.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.459
[man] Hey, how you doin'? Scotch rocks?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.056
Uh, Scotch. Neat.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.193
[cell phone vibrating]

22:42.820 --> 22:45.198
- Where you at?
- Not far.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.116
Hollywood Hills, just above Sunset Plaza.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.618
Oh, and the guy's strapped.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.535
So am I.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.996
[suspenseful music playing]

24:16.706 --> 24:18.708
[cell phone vibrating]

24:20.710 --> 24:21.669
What'd you got?

24:21.752 --> 24:24.172
[man]
His name is Hieronymus Bosch.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.631
What kind of name is that? Is that Dutch?

24:25.715 --> 24:27.800
- Where are you now?
- On my way back.

24:27.884 --> 24:28.718
Still got eyes on him?

24:28.801 --> 24:31.262
Yeah. She just called for the check.
I'm waiting outside.

24:31.345 --> 24:34.348
[dramatic music playing]

24:35.474 --> 24:38.477
[indistinct chatter]

24:48.321 --> 24:51.324
[suspenseful music playing]

25:26.400 --> 25:27.860
Shit.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.445
- Go, go, go, go.
- Where is she?

25:29.528 --> 25:30.571
Black Mercedes.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.448
- [indistinct]
- [man] Yeah, I see her. I see her.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.616
I see her.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.870
[suspenseful music playing]

25:54.345 --> 25:56.347
[911 operator]
911, what's your emergency?

25:56.430 --> 25:57.348
Yes, ma'am.

25:57.431 --> 26:01.018
Uh, there's a woman driving drunk,
swerving all over the road,

26:01.102 --> 26:03.980
and, uh, I'm just--I'm--I'm afraid
she's gonna kill somebody.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.106
[911 operator] What's your location, sir?

26:05.189 --> 26:08.693
[Det. Ellis] Uh, South on Gower,
approaching Melrose.

26:08.776 --> 26:10.861
[911 operator]
Repeat. Heading southbound?

26:10.945 --> 26:13.781
[Det. Ellis]
And now west on Melrose.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.366
[911 operator]
Can you describe the vehicle?

26:15.449 --> 26:18.369
[Det. Ellis] Yeah.
It's a black Mercedes-- oh, shit!

26:18.452 --> 26:19.745
She almost hit a car.

26:19.829 --> 26:21.664
Uh, she's out of control.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.959
She, uh, she's just turning left on,
on Larchmont.

26:29.964 --> 26:31.007
[911 operator]
One moment, sir.

26:36.595 --> 26:40.099
[tense music playing]

26:50.860 --> 26:52.987
[911 operator]
Calling [indistinct] units 67, 67.

26:53.070 --> 26:57.241
Citizen is following possible
DUI driver southbound on Larchmont.

26:57.325 --> 26:59.618
Vehicle described as a black Mercedes.

26:59.702 --> 27:00.995
[siren wails]

27:05.750 --> 27:07.376
[line ringing]

27:07.460 --> 27:09.170
[Martin]
Honey? What's wrong?

27:09.253 --> 27:12.882
Martin, I'm sorry to bother you
at home, but I have a situation.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.012
We're code six on Larchmont.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.306
Black Mercedes-Benz, license number 3,

27:20.389 --> 27:23.351
young, Adam, Mary, 543.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.421
What is this about?

27:52.505 --> 27:53.839
[man] Ma'am, I need you
to step over to the side.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.510
Wanna tell me why you pulled me over?

27:57.593 --> 27:59.345
Step off to the side, please.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.055
Let me see your driver's license
and registration.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.473
[Honey] They're in the car.

28:02.556 --> 28:03.557
Doors are locked.

28:03.641 --> 28:04.558
Do you have the keys?

28:04.642 --> 28:06.394
I'm not answering any further questions

28:06.477 --> 28:07.978
until you tell me what's going on.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.731
A citizen reported you
weaving all over the road,

28:10.815 --> 28:13.317
and you appear to be under the influence.

28:13.401 --> 28:15.361
[Honey] I wasn't weaving.
That's ridiculous.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.404
Where are you coming from?

28:16.487 --> 28:18.781
Musso & Frank's. Did you see me weave?

28:18.864 --> 28:20.032
How much you had to drink?

28:20.116 --> 28:23.327
Couple of glasses of wine,
not enough to affect my driving.

28:23.411 --> 28:24.787
That's for us to decide.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.749
You willing to undergo
a field sobriety test?

28:29.583 --> 28:30.793
Blow into a balloon?

28:30.876 --> 28:31.836
If that's what you wanna call it.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.879
Well, I'm not drunk, I am not impaired.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.006
[Det. Ellis] So are you refusing
a field sobriety test?

28:36.090 --> 28:38.342
Absolutely. I absolutely am.

28:38.426 --> 28:39.635
[Det. Ellis] Well then,
you understand we're obligated

28:39.718 --> 28:40.803
to take you into custody?

28:40.886 --> 28:42.346
For an unwarranted stop?

28:45.474 --> 28:47.017
Ma'am, please put your hands
behind your back.

28:47.101 --> 28:50.396
You've gotta be kidding--
fucking kidding me.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.730
We're taking your purse.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.735
Stupid motherfuckers.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.946
- What was that?
- Nothing.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.701
You made this easy on yourself.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.870
Well, you could tell me
why you're harassing me.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.914
[man]
Driver [indistinct] your hands.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.249
Yes, please.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.794
Patrol is gonna take her
down to the station.

29:13.878 --> 29:16.255
I told them to standby for a tow,
meet them there.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.339
Works for me.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.224
[man] [indistinct] we have alpha, Mary.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.607
[engine revving]

29:57.004 --> 29:58.214
[Det. Ellis] Got it.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.352
Bingo.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.362
[phone ringing]

30:22.029 --> 30:23.322
[gasps]

30:47.888 --> 30:48.889
What gives, Councilor?

30:48.973 --> 30:50.182
Well, that's what I'd like to know.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.351
- I've been here all night.
- DUI?

30:52.434 --> 30:54.144
Were you under the influence?

30:54.228 --> 30:56.188
I refused to take the test.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.398
Why didn't you take the test?

30:57.481 --> 30:59.567
I was not under the influence.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.402
You remind me of my ex.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.571
Often mistaken, never wrong.

31:03.654 --> 31:04.989
It was harassment.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.782
Did they take blood?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.492
Over my objections.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.286
All right. Um...

31:10.369 --> 31:12.538
...let me see what I can find out, okay?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.416
Can I get you anything in the meantime?

31:15.499 --> 31:17.585
A chocolate croissant, a diet Coke.

31:17.668 --> 31:19.920
[woman groans]

31:20.004 --> 31:21.880
And a barf bag for my friend here.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.215
Oh, yeah.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.509
All right. I will see what I can do.

31:25.593 --> 31:28.304
Um, you know what? Come with me.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.388
Let's get out of here.

31:30.848 --> 31:32.933
Let's, uh, let's walk this way.

31:33.767 --> 31:37.771
And you can just have a seat
while we sort this out.

31:38.814 --> 31:39.982
- Thank you.
- [Sgt. Mankiewicz] All right.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.693
You promise not to make a break
for it till I get back?

31:42.776 --> 31:43.902
- I promise.
- All right.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.323
- You're on the honor system.
- Got it.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.916
Mr. Bosch.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.960
Martin Rose of Rose & Associates.

32:00.044 --> 32:01.420
Nice to meet you.

32:01.503 --> 32:02.796
Heard a lot about you.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.048
You, too.

32:04.715 --> 32:05.758
Shall we?

32:05.841 --> 32:07.092
- [Harry] Lead the way.
- [Martin] Okay.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.776
- Who is this?
- This is Harry Bosch.

32:23.859 --> 32:26.070
He's the investigator working your case.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.246
- Where's Ms. Chandler?
- She's tied up in court.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.878
[Harry]
Something I wanna show you.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.803
Know who this is?

32:53.681 --> 32:55.265
- Lexi Parks.
- That's right.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.434
Murdered.

32:58.435 --> 32:59.937
And then raped postmortem.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.025
Your friend...

33:06.318 --> 33:07.236
...James Allen.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.949
Drugs, burglary, solicitation.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.702
Did--did he back my alibi?

33:14.785 --> 33:16.870
He can't help you anymore.
James Allen is dead.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.708
- What?
- [Harry] Strangled.

33:20.791 --> 33:23.168
His body was dumped
in an alley in Hollywood.

33:25.546 --> 33:27.631
You lied to your wife,
you lied to your attorney.

33:27.715 --> 33:30.092
Lie to me, and I will walk.

33:30.926 --> 33:31.927
Understood?

33:38.559 --> 33:39.768
I told you everything.

33:41.979 --> 33:42.896
Okay.

33:47.401 --> 33:48.777
Fuck this.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.906
Waste of time. Mr. Rose, let's go.

33:56.076 --> 33:57.161
Wait.

33:59.163 --> 33:59.997
Wait.

34:06.170 --> 34:09.172
[dramatic music playing]

34:11.884 --> 34:14.219
He wasn't just my dealer.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.600
We were involved.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.146
How long?

34:26.482 --> 34:27.315
Six months.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.610
You should have told us that, David.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.652
Right from the start.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.947
And what? Blow up the little,

34:35.032 --> 34:37.159
little life that I have left?

34:40.871 --> 34:42.206
Please...

34:44.166 --> 34:45.292
...I can't lose my family.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.681
Probably goes without saying,

34:59.765 --> 35:01.350
anybody finds out we're a thing...

35:02.309 --> 35:04.102
Oh, I don't plan on telling anyone.

35:04.186 --> 35:06.480
Me either, but we are living together.

35:07.481 --> 35:09.274
Until I find my own place.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.403
What about Vasquez? Does she know?

35:14.196 --> 35:15.656
Well, she's not blind.
Of course, she knows.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.074
She cool?

35:18.033 --> 35:18.867
Yeah.

35:18.951 --> 35:22.287
As long as the personal doesn't
interfere with the professional.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.211
See you around the barn.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.587
Don't you dare even look at me.

35:30.671 --> 35:32.130
[laughs]

35:38.762 --> 35:40.430
[Honey]
They were in plain clothes.

35:40.514 --> 35:42.182
- Did you get their names?
- No.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.601
I'll try to find out who brought you in

35:44.685 --> 35:46.395
and booked you, talk to them.

35:48.856 --> 35:49.940
How much did you have to drink?

35:51.191 --> 35:52.985
One more glass after you left.

35:53.861 --> 35:54.736
I had to go with Foster.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.573
He was with Allen that night.

35:58.115 --> 35:59.491
Doing more than drugs.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.243
One night stand?

36:02.286 --> 36:03.579
Last six months.

36:04.705 --> 36:06.123
And where were they that night?

36:06.206 --> 36:08.876
Motel in Santa Monica.
Allen worked out of Baruch.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.754
Great. Lied to me. Again.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.717
Everybody counts. Even David Foster.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.468
So now you believe him?

36:20.012 --> 36:21.221
Getting there.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.019
Here you go.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.520
How did you get this key?

36:29.229 --> 36:30.898
Vehicle was OOA.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.816
- Open on arrival.
- No, no. The car was locked.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.360
If you'd like to make a complaint,
I can get you the paperwork.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.280
Just show me where my car is.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.656
Space 20.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.257
Everything in order?

36:58.926 --> 37:00.928
Well, I thought I had
the Foster file in front,

37:01.011 --> 37:02.721
and now it's second to the last.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.265
You did have too much to drink.

37:06.183 --> 37:07.100
Fuck you.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.978
And I know I locked the car
with my spare key.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.230
Maybe the tow guy opened it.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.776
Look, we need to stay focused on Foster.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.278
What do we do next?

37:18.362 --> 37:20.530
[Lucas] The lab finally finished
enhancing the footage.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.370
Check this out.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.955
It's a video from the neighborhood.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.332
[Sylvia] Took long enough.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.001
[Lucas] Simon Wakefield's house,
day of the murder.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.296
Here's Chandler.

37:37.214 --> 37:40.801
Okay. Coroner estimated time
of death around early afternoon.

37:40.884 --> 37:43.720
And timestamp
puts Chandler's arrival on 4:30.

37:43.804 --> 37:46.181
Wakefield would have been floating
face-down in his pool.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.933
She didn't report it.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.727
Or maybe she was unaware
that he was living the life aquatic.

37:53.230 --> 37:54.982
Her--her prints were on the pool's camera.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.192
She retrieved Wakefield's phone
from the pool.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.069
The phone was never found.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.112
That would explain it.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.280
Then had Ramirez download the schematic.

38:04.366 --> 38:05.617
[Sylvia] What's this?

38:05.701 --> 38:07.411
[Lucas]
Wakefield's house, same day,

38:07.494 --> 38:09.705
hour or so early
before Chandler's arrival.

38:11.999 --> 38:14.084
Who does that look like to you?

38:15.836 --> 38:17.129
[Sylvia] Lev Ivanovich.

38:17.212 --> 38:20.132
That's Rogers, Keating, Wakefield.

38:21.008 --> 38:22.384
The Russians are out of reach.

38:24.428 --> 38:25.554
[Lucas] Chandler's not.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.393
[Harry]
Next time on Bosch: Legacy.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.186
[man]
All those years on the job

38:33.270 --> 38:35.272
and now lapdog to a lady lawyer.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.190
Dinosaur for the dark side.

38:38.692 --> 38:41.778
High-end watch case,
tan line on her left wrist.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.989
- You involved?
- That is, um...

38:46.116 --> 38:47.451
...that's a long story.

38:49.453 --> 38:51.246
- Am I done?
- You're not done.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.040
I accepted an assignment to CRU.

38:53.123 --> 38:54.166
Are you sure you're ready?

38:54.249 --> 38:56.334
Bosch and I will be on foot,
acting like tourists,

38:56.418 --> 38:58.712
oblivious to all the bad actors
looking to fleece us

38:58.795 --> 39:00.130
while soak in the sights.

39:01.548 --> 39:02.716
[Maddie] Freeze!

39:02.799 --> 39:04.676
[Sylvia] We don't believe
you blew up your own pipeline.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.554
You can help yourself by helping us.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.266
- So what's the emergency?
- [Harry] We've got a problem.

39:12.059 --> 39:13.977
The feds have taken over
the Wakefield case.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.981
[dramatic music playing]
