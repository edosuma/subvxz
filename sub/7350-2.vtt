WEBVTT

00:25.326 --> 00:27.795
Hey, Lieutenant,
you okay?

00:27.828 --> 00:28.829
Take a load off, man!

00:28.862 --> 00:30.264
Relax!

00:30.298 --> 00:32.433
I'm, uh... I'm fine.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.367
Yeah!

00:41.475 --> 00:43.211
Hey. How you doin' tonight?

00:43.244 --> 00:45.213
You look like you could use
something cold.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.415
Yeah. Just...

00:47.448 --> 00:49.383
some water, please. That's all.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.419
Thank you.
Darlin', why don't you go get
some air, okay?

00:51.452 --> 00:54.088
Relax a
little.

00:59.860 --> 01:03.297
Hey. Navy. Navy,
you all right?

01:04.165 --> 01:05.599
My God!

01:10.338 --> 01:12.072
Whoa, easy.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.163
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:35.196 --> 01:37.798
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:37.831 --> 01:40.301
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:40.334 --> 01:41.602
* How, how, how, how

01:41.635 --> 01:43.771
* Hey, hey

01:49.810 --> 01:51.179
* You gotta come on.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.518
You concentrate any harder,
you're gonna strain a muscle.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.488
I am learning about New Orleans.
Coming from the Great Lakes,

02:00.521 --> 02:03.491
I want to soak up all the
history and culture that I can.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.925
It'll make me
a better agent.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.361
Well, you don't need
a book to do that.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.497
I'm new to the Gulf. I need
all the help I can get.

02:09.530 --> 02:13.367
Tell me one thing you know
that I can't read about.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.370
Chicken Fried Raymond.
Who?

02:16.404 --> 02:18.839
Chicken Fried Cornelius Raymond.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.341
Street musician.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.575
Corner of Dauphine and Conti.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.377
Been standin' there for years.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.613
Got kicked in the mouth
by a buggy horse.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.216
Tooth flew
into the newly repaved concrete.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.219
Still there now, crown and all.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.453
That's disgusting.
You can't find that

02:32.486 --> 02:33.654
in a history book.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.522
Got another one.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.757
Streetcar 952

02:36.790 --> 02:39.693
that ran on the Desire
line started right here.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.562
A little slice of Americana.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.864
In all the nooks and crannies.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.600
Pride here.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.469
When?

02:48.502 --> 02:51.505
Call the morgue.
Tell 'em we'll be right there.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.840
What we got?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.842
USS Geronimo in port,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.544
and the crew's on liberty.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.546
One of her
officers got hit

02:58.579 --> 03:02.550
by a taxi early this morning
in the French Quarter.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.784
Are you going to speak
to his XO?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.853
Next on my to-do list.
Grab your things.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.855
Did you know in 1923
there was

03:07.888 --> 03:09.857
a train accident?
This horse-drawn delivery truck

03:09.890 --> 03:12.460
was crossing the rails
when out of nowhere...
Are you gonna do this all day?

03:12.493 --> 03:13.594
Do what?

03:18.799 --> 03:21.569
My mother always said, "Look
both ways before crossing."

03:21.602 --> 03:24.772
Now I realize she meant
physically and metaphorically.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.408
Why did the chicken
cross the road, Loretta?

03:27.441 --> 03:28.809
In this instance,

03:28.842 --> 03:31.412
"to get to the other side"
is clearly a misnomer.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.647
LASALLE: A simple case
of man versus car.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.650
Bartender says
Navy Lieutenant Lewis Collier

03:36.684 --> 03:39.487
was behaving erratically,
having trouble focusing.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.489
Seem like he was
on something?

03:41.522 --> 03:44.358
Drugged?
I won't know
till I do a full blood panel

03:44.392 --> 03:45.659
back at the morgue.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.561
Something had him jacked-up.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.963
Had to be something
in his system.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.333
Either he took it...

03:52.366 --> 03:53.534
Or was forced to.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.835
WADE:
Blood alcohol levels

03:54.868 --> 03:56.837
indicate he wasn't inebriated.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.308
Petechial hemorrhaging could
have been from impact but...

04:00.341 --> 04:03.844
the whites of his eyes, yellow
and jaundiced like he overdosed.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.980
The lieutenant is a plethora
of contradictions.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.582
Let me rephrase
the question.

04:08.616 --> 04:12.520
Why did the sailor
cross the road?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.555
Let me rephrase the answer.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.057
The sailor crossed
against his will.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.026
Something made him do it.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.429
Now he's dead.

04:34.975 --> 04:35.676
Anything?

04:35.709 --> 04:37.611
Collier's XO,
Commander Bates,

04:37.645 --> 04:39.313
is currently back on
board the Geronimo.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.548
We're meeting
in an hour.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.416
Details from Loretta?

04:42.450 --> 04:44.585
She and Sebastian have
started the autopsy.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.620
Anything on the lieutenant?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.722
LASALLE:
Lieutenant Lewis Collier,

04:48.756 --> 04:50.090
32 years old.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.759
Born and raised
in Chatham, Virginia.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.595
Straight "A"s in college.
No flags on the play.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.796
Engaged to be married.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.030
Navy record?

04:57.064 --> 04:58.466
Spotless.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.401
Not even
a rental car parking ticket.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.635
Somebody could've had
their eye on Collier

05:01.669 --> 05:03.571
the minute
he stepped ashore.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.006
Could've followed him,
drugged him at dinner.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.908
It's happened before.
It fits the M.O.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.610
Wait for the drugs to kick in,

05:09.643 --> 05:10.844
follow him back to port,

05:10.878 --> 05:12.513
mug him along the way.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.815
He just... never got that far.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.884
It'll show up in the labs.
Maybe.

05:16.917 --> 05:20.721
Pride, Collier's
fiancée just flew in.

05:20.754 --> 05:24.024
Let's see what she can tell us.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.428
WOMAN:
You didn't know Lewis.

05:27.461 --> 05:31.365
He was... so sweet,

05:31.399 --> 05:33.534
so gentle.

05:33.567 --> 05:37.705
You're right.
I-I didn't know the lieutenant.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.707
But I know his shipmates

05:39.740 --> 05:42.776
were having a good time
last night.

05:42.810 --> 05:47.448
A-And I know he might've
taken something accidentally.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.483
Or someone gave him something.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.118
Lewis liked
to have fun,

05:51.151 --> 05:52.920
but he was
super careful.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.624
He worked out,
watched his diet,

05:56.657 --> 05:59.693
took great
care of himself.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.862
Navy records don't disagree.

06:01.895 --> 06:07.635
He was the most responsible
man that I've ever known.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.570
And yet something happened.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.405
When he was in that bar,

06:11.439 --> 06:14.141
everything changed.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.710
Lewis cared about us.

06:16.744 --> 06:20.548
He wanted a family. He wouldn't
do anything stupid to risk that.

06:20.581 --> 06:24.652
Something made him run in front
of that car.

06:25.853 --> 06:29.557
Autopsy's happening as we speak.

06:29.590 --> 06:33.761
I loved him.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.899
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

06:38.932 --> 06:42.436
Agent Pride, my
fiancé's dead.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.672
Please find out why.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.745
Talk to me, Loretta.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.747
Steinbeck.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.783
Pardon?

06:55.816 --> 06:58.619
Gone are the days
when people died of...

06:58.652 --> 07:00.621
working too hard
in the fields,

07:00.654 --> 07:02.823
and old age
was a legitimate

07:02.856 --> 07:05.158
medical diagnosis.

07:05.192 --> 07:08.596
I bring up Mr. Steinbeck because
those were simpler times.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.665
Now it's all about peeling back
the layers.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.935
Cases like this are
mysteries wrapped in...

07:14.968 --> 07:17.004
complex enigmas.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.673
I take it
you're curious about this one.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.108
So far

07:21.141 --> 07:22.676
all I can determine
of the lieutenant

07:22.710 --> 07:25.613
is that he had some kind
of upper respiratory infection.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.748
Labs back?
Yeah.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.618
A basic analysis.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.919
White cells,

07:31.952 --> 07:33.253
slightly elevated.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.922
Antihistamines were found
in his system.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.257
Decongestants. He must
have been feeling flu-ish.

07:37.290 --> 07:41.862
As I said before, no alcohol
and no hallucinogenics.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.665
What about a chemical
imbalance or TIA?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.099
Something to account
for the behavior.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.202
A stroke's doubtful
but worth checking.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.639
Pride,
Hmm?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.807
you know, there's a snowball
truck in the parking lot.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.177
Is that you being polite?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.612
You want me to go?
I appreciate...

07:58.646 --> 08:01.248
You know I appreciate
the... guesswork,

08:01.281 --> 08:03.083
but you need to let us
do our jobs.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.786
Why are you so antsy
about him anyway?

08:05.819 --> 08:09.623
He was a good man,
good officer.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.859
No signs of bad behavior.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.094
I got a feelin'
there's more to it.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.630
As do I.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.065
Mango or chocolate?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.800
:
Neither.

08:19.833 --> 08:23.937
Until the lieutenant provides me
with some much-needed answers,

08:23.971 --> 08:26.574
I prefer to remain sugar-free.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.241
Go.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.223
I think the immigration monument
is not far from here.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.825
It's just down the road
from here.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.727
I used to patrol this area
when I was a deputy.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.796
You know,
the late 1800s was

08:48.829 --> 08:50.698
a very interesting time
in local history.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.633
Yesterday I was reading
about the Italian community

08:52.666 --> 08:54.602
in New Orleans...
You're really gettin' into this.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.969
There's just so much.
I'm like a sponge.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.738
I want to soak up everything
I can.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.840
Don't believe everything
you read, Brody.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.009
History's fun,
but it's not always accurate.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.777
I want to hear

09:03.811 --> 09:05.212
about your days
in the sheriff's department.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.147
Nothing much to hear.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.250
Alabama boy moves to New Orleans
and does some good.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.919
You're being modest.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.921
Got to be more to it
than that.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.756
Some things are better
in small bites.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.257
I guess I'm
one of 'em.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.929
Commander Bates.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.798
Agent Lasalle,
Agent Brody, NCIS.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.233
You're here
about Collier.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.068
He was a
gifted officer

09:28.101 --> 09:30.804
and a good man.
It's a terrible loss.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.806
This is Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt,
one of our medical consultants.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.942
He was just offering some
grief counseling to my crew.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.910
Glad I was here
and available to help.

09:36.944 --> 09:40.347
How are they doing,
Doctor?
Wounds take time to heal,

09:40.380 --> 09:43.617
whether they're accidental
or during times of conflict.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.252
Posttraumatic symptoms
will surface eventually.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.221
All we can do is address them
one day at a time.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.223
If there's anything more
I can do for you, Commander,

09:50.257 --> 09:52.760
don't hesitate to ask.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.729
People say Collier was behaving
erratically last night,

09:55.763 --> 09:57.064
like he was on something.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.099
Does that surprise you?
Very much.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.034
Collier was a pro.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.903
All business.
Does he have any enemies?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.404
None, as far as I know.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.973
But we work under
a lot of pressure.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.875
Issues come up on occasion.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.911
What are you getting at?
Wondering
if the lieutenant was targeted.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.281
By whom? We're all mourning
this loss together.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.883
You know, I've been
in the Navy 15 years,

10:15.916 --> 10:17.250
and I've never lost a sailor
until now.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.086
You always know

10:19.119 --> 10:22.222
it's a possibility in war time,
but not during a port visit.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.324
And not like this.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.430
Sebastian?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.967
Oh, nice to see you,
Agent Pride.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.669
Everything all right?

10:35.703 --> 10:37.270
Well, yes and no.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.272
Mind telling me
about the "no"?

10:41.909 --> 10:43.410
For thousands of years,
Agent Pride,

10:43.443 --> 10:45.412
people have been reaping
the benefits of yoga.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.915
Scholars have traced its roots
back to Stone Age shamanism.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.950
It increases blood flow
to the brain.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.085
Helps me and others focus
in times of trouble.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.954
You troubled about something?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.222
There are certain things

10:55.255 --> 10:56.924
that I've come
to count on in life.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.826
The Rebirth at the Maple Leaf
every Tuesday,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.728
the fact
that I can do a speed run

11:00.761 --> 11:02.262
of Super Mario Bros. 2
in eight and a half minutes, and

11:02.295 --> 11:04.898
my trusty Mass
Spectrometer, though,

11:04.932 --> 11:06.900
not necessarily in that order.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.335
What are you getting at,
Sebastian?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.103
Well, I had
prepped a sample

11:10.137 --> 11:11.872
of Lieutenant Collier's
stomach contents for analysis,

11:11.905 --> 11:13.941
but I'm getting readings
that don't make any sense.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.943
A bacteria that I didn't
expect to encounter.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.444
What kind of bacteria?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.446
Oh, I'm not talking
about a good kind of bacteria,

11:19.479 --> 11:22.382
like in live yogurt cultures,
or that Jamie Lee Curtis stuff,

11:22.415 --> 11:25.185
but like a real
nasty-looking bacteria.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.820
The kind that
destroys small cities

11:26.854 --> 11:28.188
in Japanese
monster movies.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.190
So, anyway, I thought
I'd take a moment,

11:30.223 --> 11:32.259
center myself,
do dolphin pose.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.894
Did it help?
Not especially, no.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.396
But it did give me time
to focus and prepare

11:36.429 --> 11:38.298
to explore the
accuracy of my data.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.067
Something's-something's
definitely miscalculated.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.969
How far along is Loretta?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.270
Concluding her autopsy.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.838
She should be
handing me all kinds

11:44.872 --> 11:46.473
of pertinent information
in a matter of...

11:46.506 --> 11:48.876
Uh-oh. Dr. Wade.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.283
Stop right there! Go back!

11:56.316 --> 11:58.351
Both of you, get back!
You need a mask in here.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.487
Loretta, what is it?
Are you all right?

12:00.520 --> 12:01.521
Go on, get back!

12:01.554 --> 12:04.357
Both of you!
Wh... hold on.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.459
I've detected septicemia

12:06.493 --> 12:09.029
and bacteria
in the decedent's lungs.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.331
The sinuses are full
of bloody mucus, the bleeding

12:11.364 --> 12:13.834
is into the dermis
and the internal organs.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.769
Can you make a hypothesis,
Mr. Lund?

12:15.803 --> 12:18.872
Well, I mean, it-it could be
any number of things really.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.507
Although, the bacteria
that you're mentioning

12:20.540 --> 12:22.910
explains my Mass
Spec concern.
And?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.845
But without definitive
sampling I could... Oh, my.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.746
I got to get
my orange vest!

12:29.082 --> 12:31.051
I'm very focused right now.
I know the protocol.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.254
Loretta, what
the hell is this?

12:34.287 --> 12:36.189
This man isn't drugged.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.758
He has bubonic plague!

12:53.540 --> 12:56.143
VANCE:
Before I continue,
were you all checked?

12:56.176 --> 12:57.110
Head to toe.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.445
Vaccinated, too.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.247
This is the first confirmed case

13:00.280 --> 13:03.416
of bubonic plague in a U.S.
metropolitan city in decades.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.452
Course of action
is Yumen, China.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.420
Happened in Yumen last July.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.157
Man died of the plague, and
they closed down the whole city.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.892
Quarantines, roadblocks,
you name it.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.526
Swift action prevented
an outbreak.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.528
Of course, we're not there yet,
but we need to follow suit.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.231
We need to track Collier's path
through the city.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.500
Figure out all the people
he came in contact with,

13:20.533 --> 13:22.502
where he ate, even
which bathrooms he used.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.071
Hospitals are on alert.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.139
BOLO's out
on anyone showing symptoms.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.275
New Orleans knows how
to take on a crisis.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.443
It should. You've been
to hell and back.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.445
And yet, we're still here,
Director.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.247
Can't get rid
of us that easy.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.448
All right,
we're following standard,

13:35.482 --> 13:37.284
bio-attack emergency protocol.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.452
Where are we
with the Geronimo?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.954
Ship is on lockdown, and

13:40.988 --> 13:42.189
we're rounding up sailors
from liberty.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.590
Round faster.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.425
Enlist the help
of local law enforcement.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.627
If the contagion happened
on board, they're all carriers.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.497
I'm on it.
PRIDE:
We're gonna need help
from the CDC.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.532
Details on symptoms
and treatments.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.567
Incubation is two to six days.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.369
Since the crew
just started liberty,

13:56.403 --> 13:59.339
that means it had
to originate on board at sea.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.409
Doc Wade said flu medication
was in Collier's blood work.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.511
He was sick, just
didn't know how bad.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.380
Mayor, governor,
who else knows?

14:07.414 --> 14:10.483
The goal is to keep this
orderly, calm and focused.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.887
Sir, it says here that the
bubonic plague, going back

14:13.921 --> 14:17.090
to the late Middle Ages,
was primarily spread by fleas

14:17.124 --> 14:19.559
associated with mice and rats.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.494
Water rat could have been
on board the whole time.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.463
Or snuck on
with food or supplies.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.565
Pride, it's clear we need
to contain this situation fast.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.235
If word gets out,
a citywide panic

14:28.268 --> 14:31.138
would be just as deadly
as the plague itself.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.441
:
Yeah.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.544
PRIDE:
That'd be 34 unaccounted
for, right?

14:37.577 --> 14:40.147
I got them, I got them.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.415
Okay.
All right, can I have
everybody's attention, please?

14:44.184 --> 14:48.055
We have the full support
of the Navy, the Pentagon,

14:48.088 --> 14:50.323
and the national
health organizations.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.961
Now, as of roll call half an
hour ago, there are 34 sailors

14:53.994 --> 14:56.296
from the Geronimo
still at liberty

14:56.329 --> 14:57.664
in the city of New Orleans.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.532
They're all
being contacted.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.702
NCIS, in conjunction
with local law enforcement,

15:02.735 --> 15:06.173
is looking to pick up
each and every one of them.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.508
And I can assure you
that we won't stop

15:08.541 --> 15:11.311
until every crew member
is safely returned

15:11.344 --> 15:13.913
to the ship and tested.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.217
Doc Wade.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.187
Have there been any reports
at local hospitals

15:20.220 --> 15:22.522
of civilian patients
exhibiting symptoms?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.357
None. We're in constant
communication

15:24.391 --> 15:25.725
with the emergency rooms,
and there's nothing yet.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.360
HUFCUTT:
We've gathered as much

15:27.394 --> 15:28.661
antibiotic

15:28.695 --> 15:31.398
and live-attenuated
EV76 vaccine as we can.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.433
Bubonic isn't something
we had stockpiled.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.735
No one saw this coming.

15:35.768 --> 15:40.573
All we can do is hope for the
best and prepare for the worst.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.542
Copies of my autopsy

15:42.575 --> 15:44.577
on Lieutenant Collier
are being distributed.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.580
As laboratory specifics
are determined,

15:47.614 --> 15:49.516
you'll be the first to know.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.484
Based on your initial
examinations, Dr. Wade,

15:51.518 --> 15:55.222
how physically destructive
is this bubonic strain?

15:56.589 --> 15:59.192
It's the worst I've ever seen.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.553
Six crew members from
the Geronimo were found

16:26.586 --> 16:28.188
in the Garden District.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.589
No visible sign
of illness.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.192
That's good news.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.027
Sheriff offering air support?

16:34.061 --> 16:35.628
Mounted officers
in the Quarter,

16:35.662 --> 16:38.031
air and patrol units
everywhere else.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.067
Why is finding sailors
like herding cats?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.203
I got to say-- murderers,

16:43.236 --> 16:45.372
drug dealers, terrorists--
I can take 'em all down.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.141
But chasing a germ scares
the hell out of me.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.644
We'll do it together.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.713
Let's get out there
and stop this.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.316
We're gonna stop it

16:56.349 --> 16:58.785
before it stops New Orleans.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.424
That was Pride.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.126
They just picked up five
more from the Geronimo.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.595
Fishing trip on a charter
in the gulf.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.796
All of 'em was together.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.098
Any symptoms?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.499
Nothing yet.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.700
Docs are checking.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.568
Local sheriff
and NOPD units divided the city

17:15.602 --> 17:17.304
into different search quadrants.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.172
Hospitals got
phone banks going.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.274
Reaching out to locals,
asking if they've seen anything.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.810
We put tracking software
on every sailor's

17:23.843 --> 17:26.246
cell phone.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.814
Brody, you've
been a big help.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.816
Pride and I
want you to know

17:29.849 --> 17:31.818
we kind of like
having you around.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.421
There's been way too
much testosterone

17:34.454 --> 17:35.755
in this office
for too long.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.191
Oh. You two know
I needed a change.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.826
I guess I got lucky.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.361
Cell tracker.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.164
Got a bead on one of
the missing crewmen.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.598
It's trying to lock in.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.668
Phone belongs to...

17:48.701 --> 17:51.838
Ensign Jerome Diggs
out of Cleveland, Ohio.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.541
Somewhere on the bayou.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.443
It'll be daylight
before we reach him.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.810
I'll call Pride, tell
him to meet us there?

17:57.844 --> 18:00.447
Let's move.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.463
Another hand.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.830
No limit, Texas Hold 'Em.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.467
Little blind's 25, big's 50.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.235
Antes doubled every 15 minutes.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.205
Little late to be upping
the stakes, hey, big man?

18:25.238 --> 18:27.574
It's my game, my rules.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.709
Hey, look, we're just
trying to have some fun.

18:31.578 --> 18:35.382
Fun. You want fun,
there's a casino downtown.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.849
Boy, I am prepared

18:36.883 --> 18:38.885
to advance you
some betting money.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.754
What's the vig?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.424
Double the advance every hand.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.394
It's too rich for my blood.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.495
You here to complain or win?

18:50.863 --> 18:52.832
NCIS. Hands where I can see 'em.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.907
You Ensign Diggs?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.510
Yes, sir. What's going on?

19:03.543 --> 19:06.646
More than you realize. Come
on. Let's go, everybody up.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.848
Come on, let's go, everybody!

19:10.250 --> 19:12.385
You too, Junior.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.886
Get a move on.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.822
I ain't going nowhere.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.390
Not with all my
money sitting here.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.427
I had a feeling.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.829
:
We were just playing
a friendly game.

19:22.862 --> 19:27.967
It really smells awful in here.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.770
Smells like
stupidity to me.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.408
You know what, uh...

19:35.442 --> 19:37.777
I think you best leave.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.612
You need to put your hands up.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.415
We're shutting
this game down.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.883
You're under arrest.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.260
Damn, Christopher.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.863
That was pretty.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.632
But if he's infected,

19:59.666 --> 20:02.269
we're gonna have
some sick gators on our hands.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.846
Talk to us, Brody.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.385
That's what I'm talking about.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.619
Also heard from the quarantine

20:19.652 --> 20:20.920
at the vets hospital.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.955
Ensign Diggs did test positive
for bubonic,

20:22.989 --> 20:24.591
but they got to him in time.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.593
Fatality rate
decreases by 50%

20:26.626 --> 20:28.295
once the antibiotic
is administered.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.896
They're pretty sure
he'll make it.

20:29.929 --> 20:30.963
11 to go.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.932
Let's find us some sailors.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.567
Call coming in.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.604
PRIDE:
That's the crisis center.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.572
Update, Doctors.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.808
Agent Pride, the antibiotics
seem to be working

20:41.841 --> 20:43.643
with the crewmen showing
positive symptoms.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.413
The EV76 vaccine
is being administered

20:46.446 --> 20:47.980
to everyone else
on board the ship.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.983
So far we have only one isolated
civilian case connected

20:51.017 --> 20:52.652
to a woman, a tourist, staying

20:52.685 --> 20:54.854
at a downtown hotel, but
we think we got to her in time.

20:54.887 --> 20:58.024
How far outside of the city
does the vaccine need to reach?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.659
We're prepared,
pharmaceutically,

20:59.692 --> 21:01.861
to go all the way to
the state border if necessary.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.996
All of the manufacturers
have been contacted

21:04.030 --> 21:05.532
and they're standing by.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.600
But we still haven't found
ground zero.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.069
Agent Lasalle's right. We can't
guarantee it's controlled

21:10.102 --> 21:11.904
until we know
where it started.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.040
Thank you, Doctors.
We need to get
back on that ship.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.942
If it started there, we have
to forensically determine

21:15.975 --> 21:17.544
the origin
of the bacteria.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.746
Okay, I like y'all
and I love this job,

21:19.779 --> 21:22.749
but...
Relax. I already
volunteered.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.551
When?
As long as the
hazmat suit fits,

21:24.584 --> 21:27.554
I'm good to go.

21:27.587 --> 21:32.091
And Director Vance has sent
some qualified help down, too.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.360
Who?
Someone who's
built up

21:33.393 --> 21:34.761
a possible tolerance

21:34.794 --> 21:36.363
having been exposed
to bubonic plague

21:36.396 --> 21:37.764
ten years ago.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.032
And he's willing
to roll the dice again?

21:40.066 --> 21:41.634
I don't know
if that agent's brave

21:41.668 --> 21:43.936
or just plain pigheaded
and foolish.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.907
BATES:
Are you some sort

21:47.940 --> 21:50.610
of infectious disease expert,
Agent DiNozzo?

21:50.643 --> 21:51.844
Ah.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.981
Do I detect
sarcasm, Commander?

21:55.014 --> 21:57.884
I've had my brush with
a particularly virulent strain

21:57.917 --> 21:59.118
a few years back, but...

21:59.151 --> 22:00.820
I came through smelling
like a daisy.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.889
Ah. You're a lucky man.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.891
I've heard that.

22:04.924 --> 22:09.729
Well, every time something like
this pops up, they call me in.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.831
They call me
the plague whisperer.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.967
Ah. Agent Pride.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.703
Don't you look protected.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.138
I feel like an andouille sausage
in an extra small casing.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.640
All I heard
was "sausage."

22:20.673 --> 22:22.008
But you're
dressed correctly

22:22.041 --> 22:24.411
because, of course,
you have a daughter

22:24.444 --> 22:27.514
and this is ground zero,
which makes it dangerous.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.981
By the way,
Commander,

22:29.015 --> 22:30.082
did you shut the
ventilation down

22:30.116 --> 22:31.083
all over the ship?
Of course.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.152
We followed all standard
operating procedures.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.021
What's the status of the crew,
Commander?

22:35.054 --> 22:37.123
Everyone remains on lockdown
in their assigned berthings.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.058
Our corpsmen
are still making rounds,

22:39.091 --> 22:41.060
giving every person a
thorough exam and administering

22:41.093 --> 22:42.929
the vaccine as necessary.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.998
So where was the ship recently?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.000
We've been conducting
training exercises nonstop

22:48.034 --> 22:49.736
the last few months.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.137
Started off Cape Horn,

22:51.170 --> 22:53.773
up the Peru-Chile Trench
to the Panama Canal.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.775
Passed Cuba
to the Tropic of Cancer

22:55.808 --> 22:56.976
and back into the Gulf.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.978
Make any stops along the way?

22:59.011 --> 23:01.414
Just for fuel and supplies
but no one left the pier.

23:01.448 --> 23:04.116
New Orleans was
the first liberty
the crew has had in weeks.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.519
We're going to need to see
the manifest and ship's log.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.120
That's not a problem.
We should start

23:08.154 --> 23:09.956
with Lieutenant Collier's
stateroom.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.458
Well, that's in O-Country.

23:11.491 --> 23:14.093
All right.
Here we go.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.466
Appreciate the company.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.934
I appreciate you coming down.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.070
Not exactly a
social call.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.507
You kidding me? Every time
I get a gig like this,

23:27.540 --> 23:29.175
they double my vacation time.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.710
Is it worth it?

23:30.743 --> 23:33.412
You've never been
on vacation with me.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.188
Hello.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.856
You must be Sebastian Lund.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.826
I could spot a forensic geek
from a mile away.

23:46.859 --> 23:47.894
Sebastian, allow
me to introduce

23:47.927 --> 23:49.462
Carol Wilson,

23:49.496 --> 23:52.131
lab tech extraordinaire
from the CDC.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.133
You keep laying on
that Southern charm, Doc,

23:54.166 --> 23:56.202
and I might not leave
when this case is over.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.938
It's nice to meet
you, sweetie.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.173
Pleasure. Look, I'm sorry.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.242
I'm not used to working
with strangers in my lab.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.046
Especially not on a case
as significant as this.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.548
Oh, well, Carol is no stranger.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.049
She's probably one
of the sharpest minds

24:10.082 --> 24:12.051
in bacterial immunology.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.821
And who doesn't get excited
about a plague?

24:14.854 --> 24:16.589
Best in the business.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.658
Dr. Wade's
been filling me in.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.927
Look, I'm here to help
in any way I can.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.063
See, the thing is what we need
is an expert in Yersinia pestis.

24:24.096 --> 24:27.734
So...
Well, that's funny because
I minored in pestis in college.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.602
If there's
a bad germ out there,

24:29.636 --> 24:31.638
this bad girl's gonna find it.

24:32.605 --> 24:33.806
Well, if you'll excuse me,

24:33.840 --> 24:34.807
I have some equipment

24:34.841 --> 24:36.075
to decontaminate.
No...

24:36.108 --> 24:39.145
You two... carry on.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.514
All right.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.750
Uh, well, let's... dive in.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.118
Ms. Wilson, feel free to get
acquainted with my equipment.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.688
Uh, no. Well,

24:48.721 --> 24:50.690
I wasn't...
I wasn't trying to suggest

24:50.723 --> 24:52.291
that you actually...
Let's get

24:52.324 --> 24:54.226
these synapses fired up,
Lund, okay?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.228
Uh, mm...

24:58.330 --> 25:00.933
Lieutenant Collier was
something of a neat freak.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.135
Collier led by example.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.237
He was always
a squared-away officer.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.273
Wish I could have seen this
coming.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.275
Nothing you could have done
about it, Commander.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.210
I'm responsible for everyone
on this ship.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.245
If the contagion
started here, I want

25:13.279 --> 25:16.048
to know how and why.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.117
Trash collecting.
Who knew there'd be

25:18.150 --> 25:21.287
a Fred Sanford element
to my very special career?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.690
Bad news, gentlemen.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.259
Come with me.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.702
Any vitals?

25:39.105 --> 25:41.107
Same signs. Same plague.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.942
And no one noticed?

25:42.975 --> 25:45.244
Duncan apparently said
he was tired.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.979
He went to sleep.
He never woke.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.215
We're gonna have
to search his whole quarters.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.851
Top to bottom.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.219
Shh. Hold on.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.922
What is it, DiNozzo?

25:55.955 --> 25:57.356
Do you hear that?
Something...

25:57.389 --> 25:59.225
Is it coming from
the walls?

26:01.628 --> 26:03.596
It's like a scra...

26:03.630 --> 26:05.331
It's over here.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.167
What is that?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.369
Oh, boy.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.337
Oh!
Hey, look out!

26:11.370 --> 26:13.906
Look out. There it is. Get it.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.341
BATES:
Where is it?

26:15.374 --> 26:17.209
Here... here it goes.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.378
Well, well.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.014
Look what the cat
dragged in.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.116
Can I go home now?

26:26.252 --> 26:29.789
How can something so small
be so dangerous?

26:29.822 --> 26:32.892
Actually, Agent Brody,
he's innocent.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.361
And totally healthy.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.896
Blood work came back negative.

26:36.929 --> 26:37.930
No plague at all?

26:37.964 --> 26:39.231
That's right. No sign

26:39.265 --> 26:40.800
of bacterial infection.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.902
Well, if it wasn't a rat,
what else could it be?

26:42.935 --> 26:44.403
Uh-oh.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.073
BRODY: What's uh
I don't like "uh-oh."

26:47.106 --> 26:49.108
Skin samples from both
Lieutenant Collier

26:49.141 --> 26:52.144
and the ensign appear
to be the same.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.981
Both men were infected by
the same strain of plague.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.116
That's not exactly a surprise.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.652
Yeah, but the purity
of the strain is.

26:59.686 --> 27:02.121
Guys, this is a version
of the plague

27:02.154 --> 27:06.392
that couldn't have come from
a flea or a cute little rat.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.394
This abomination
didn't occur naturally.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.062
It happened in a lab.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.865
It's a synthesized and
manufactured bacteria.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.702
So neither of our victims
were infected by accident.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.704
This ship was targeted,

27:17.737 --> 27:19.706
as in military terrorism.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.674
And by sending them out
on liberty...

27:21.708 --> 27:24.911
Our own sailors become weapons
of mass destruction.

28:00.412 --> 28:01.714
I've been calling your cell.

28:01.748 --> 28:04.817
You're not answering.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.485
Left my phone on my desk.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.954
Sorry.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.458
You want some
coffee? There's...

28:12.491 --> 28:15.862
a fresh pot. The beans
are from Spitfire.

28:15.895 --> 28:19.298
You're clearly not planning
on getting any sleep.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.300
Too much on my mind.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.170
Didn't sleep in 2005.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.438
No point
trying now.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.480
Two dead.

28:34.513 --> 28:39.385
How many more...
infected?

28:39.418 --> 28:42.321
How much
can the...

28:42.354 --> 28:44.423
city take?

28:44.456 --> 28:47.293
How much more
can the city handle?

28:48.360 --> 28:51.363
Dwayne Cassius Pride,
you listen to me.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.803
You want to see strength?

28:56.836 --> 28:59.338
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.243
I'll get the coffee.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.116
ABBY:
Only a handful of laboratories
in the world have access

29:10.149 --> 29:11.317
to a strain this powerful.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.353
The question is,
which one did it come from?

29:14.386 --> 29:18.858
I know the bubonic and
this offspring are crazy potent.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.159
Don't you just love her?

29:20.192 --> 29:22.094
We know for sure that...

29:22.128 --> 29:24.096
the Geronimo was circling
South America, right?

29:24.130 --> 29:26.298
In Chincha, Peru,
it's common to eat cat.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.568
Cats can carry Toxoplasma
that can cause toxoplasmosis.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.137
Okay, okay, okay.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.139
True but gross.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.907
And why?
Well,

29:34.941 --> 29:37.109
toxoplasmosis just happens
to be one of the many diseases

29:37.143 --> 29:38.945
Navy Medical Research Unit 6

29:38.978 --> 29:40.312
studies in their
lab at Lima.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.448
Including plague.

29:42.481 --> 29:46.919
Number Six is like
the Fort Knox of bad germs.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.455
It's like the world's
most secure petri dish.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.523
Yeah, and no one on the ship
had any business being there.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.359
How did it get on board?
I mean,

29:53.392 --> 29:55.127
it didn't just hitch a ride.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.296
Or did it?

29:57.329 --> 30:00.199
The evidence that
Agent Pride brought in--

30:00.232 --> 30:02.468
what did the victims
have in their trash cans?

30:02.501 --> 30:03.502
Well, there was
some dental floss,

30:03.535 --> 30:05.504
gum wrappers, one

30:05.537 --> 30:06.605
questionable magazine.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.540
Someone left
some chewing tobacco

30:08.574 --> 30:10.442
gnawed up in a big ball.
That's nasty.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.278
And there were muffin
wrappers in both.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.014
One blueberry and one... bran.

30:15.047 --> 30:18.350
Uh-huh. Now prove
they were tampered with.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.886
Yeah, running them.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.189
Looks like both foil

30:23.222 --> 30:26.225
wrappers had tiny needle
punctures in the outer paper.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.526
Yeah, and I'm
picking up a high

30:27.559 --> 30:29.495
concentration
of Yersinia pestis

30:29.528 --> 30:30.596
in the remaining crumbs.
They must have

30:30.629 --> 30:32.398
come from the ship's galley

30:32.431 --> 30:33.599
or ward room.
Okay, so

30:33.632 --> 30:36.535
connect baked goods
to darkest Peru.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.537
Sebastian, you're a genius.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.207
Namru Six in Lima
had a security

30:41.240 --> 30:42.942
breach two weeks ago.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.977
They kept it on the down low,

30:45.011 --> 30:47.947
but someone entered
the live contagion unit.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.551
Muffins?

30:52.584 --> 30:53.953
Bad ones.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.521
Filled with the plague.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.089
Where'd they come from?

30:57.123 --> 30:59.458
The galley.

30:59.491 --> 31:00.927
It says in the manifest

31:00.960 --> 31:02.628
Culinary Specialist,

31:02.661 --> 31:05.331
Second Class Petty Officer
Linus Warren

31:05.364 --> 31:08.300
signed for supplies
in port in Lima.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.568
Who is he?
Petty Officer Warren.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.271
One of the three sailors
still missing.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.973
Linus is up
to his eyeballs in debt.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.607
Headed for bankruptcy.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.009
That's motive.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.677
Yeah, but he's got a history
of charity work.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.446
He volunteers all over
the world, including a place

31:20.479 --> 31:23.916
in Central City the
last time he was here.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.617
Café Reconcile.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.253
Read about it
in one of my books.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.088
It was started years ago
as a youth support center.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.156
PRIDE:
Call them.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.323
Find out if he's there.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.712
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands in the air! Don't move!

31:53.745 --> 31:55.381
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:55.414 --> 31:56.582
NCIS! Hands up!

31:56.615 --> 31:58.584
Turn around!
Petty Officer Linus Warren,

31:58.617 --> 32:00.619
we've been looking for you.
Why

32:00.652 --> 32:02.921
I was on liberty; I didn't do
anything wrong, I swear!

32:10.062 --> 32:11.730
What happened
to these guys?

32:11.763 --> 32:12.398
They're dead.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.633
Bubonic plague, not pretty.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.368
You a baker, Linus?

32:16.402 --> 32:17.603
Yes, sir, that's what I do.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.605
Hm, and I'm sure

32:19.638 --> 32:22.741
you not answering
a dozen calls from your XO,

32:22.774 --> 32:25.444
NCIS and Navy HQ

32:25.477 --> 32:27.246
is just a coincidence.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.614
My phone broke.

32:29.748 --> 32:30.549
I was planning on being

32:30.582 --> 32:32.251
back at the ship
when liberty ended.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.685
People are dying,

32:33.719 --> 32:35.087
Petty Officer Warren,
and we think you're responsible.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.422
We think you poisoned them.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.589
How?

32:37.623 --> 32:38.624
Namru Six ring a bell?

32:38.657 --> 32:40.092
Nam... I don't know

32:40.126 --> 32:41.627
what you're talking about!

32:41.660 --> 32:43.595
I didn't kill anybody.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.064
I just bake.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.733
I needed to chill and unwind.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.568
I called some friends
at the café here in town,

32:49.601 --> 32:51.603
and they said to come on over.
This is messed up, man.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.205
This is crazy.

32:53.239 --> 32:56.675
I couldn't kill anybody.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.344
You just bake.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.412
Yes, sir, I just bake.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.688
What do you mean,
it came from the mess?

33:09.721 --> 33:12.524
Muffins, to be exact, Commander.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.593
And somebody had to get to them.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.262
And you think
one of my crew did this?

33:16.295 --> 33:18.197
Somebody from my ship?

33:18.230 --> 33:20.599
It had to be somebody on board.
You tell me.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.234
Agent Pride, I don't understand
what you're asking.

33:22.268 --> 33:26.705
Did anybody else
board the Geronimo, Commander?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.740
No. All crew
and passengers aboard

33:28.774 --> 33:31.177
were registered in the manifest.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.713
Then forgive my redundancy,
but...

33:34.746 --> 33:38.184
could you please run me
through things one more time?

33:38.217 --> 33:41.420
As we discussed,
the ship stopped in Lima

33:41.453 --> 33:43.655
to refuel and get supplies.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.257
And no crew left the pier?

33:45.291 --> 33:46.325
No one.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.731
But there was an adjustment.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.167
There was an adjustment

33:55.201 --> 33:58.770
to the ship's medical team.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.506
Dr. Hufcutt?

34:00.539 --> 34:03.175
You offer rides
to civilians sometimes?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.810
He transferred via helo.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.546
While we were already at sea,
not in port.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.348
But close enough, Commander.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.683
Can you tell me where
I might find the doctor?

34:11.717 --> 34:13.219
Well, if he's not
at the crisis center,

34:13.252 --> 34:14.620
he lives in Baton Rouge.

34:14.653 --> 34:15.787
That's where
his pharmaceutical company

34:15.821 --> 34:16.855
is based.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.290
You don't think...

34:18.324 --> 34:19.825
I don't think, ma'am.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.662
I know.

34:35.774 --> 34:36.975
Give me something.

34:37.008 --> 34:40.146
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, founder
of Hufcutt Pharmaceuticals.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.381
The company smartly made
alliances with the military,

34:42.414 --> 34:43.749
providing combat meds

34:43.782 --> 34:45.617
to field hospitals
for the past few years.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.153
His reputation alone

34:47.186 --> 34:48.720
gave him access
to the labs in Lima.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.456
How's business now?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.224
Terrible.
Several bad investments

34:52.258 --> 34:53.759
have him on the verge
of collapse.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.861
Is that a big ol' motive
I hear around the corner?

34:55.894 --> 34:58.464
Hufcutt takes advantage
of the navy

34:58.497 --> 35:01.833
to steal and create a plague
he can vaccinate against.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.802
Like the bird flu scare
a few years ago.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.838
He'd make hundreds of millions
on the antibiotics alone.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.240
He manufactured
the vaccine, too.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.442
Doesn't sound like
a coincidence to me.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.677
So where is he now?
No one knows.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.744
We called his home, his office.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.280
He's vanished,
fell off the grid.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.347
All right, track everything,

35:15.381 --> 35:17.183
credit cards, cell phones.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.685
I want to know when he unzips
his fly in the men's bathroom.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.321
Find the son of a bitch.
Where you going?

35:22.354 --> 35:25.191
Need to see a doctor, stat.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.427
DR. HALEY:
Look, I'm sorry, Agent Pride,

35:28.460 --> 35:29.528
but I don't know.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.197
I came home to take a shower.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.599
The last two days have been
difficult, to say the least.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.434
I need to get back
to the crisis center.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.236
I don't doubt that,
Dr. Haley, I just...

35:37.269 --> 35:38.670
You and I have been
through plenty over the years.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.206
I just need to know

35:40.239 --> 35:42.841
if there's anything you talked
with Dr. Hufcutt about.

35:45.744 --> 35:49.381
He mentioned he had an important
event to go to in Jackson.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.250
A convention of some kind.

35:51.283 --> 35:54.353
Something he said we actually
relevant to our dire situation.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.687
What kind of convention?

35:55.721 --> 35:57.223
I assume something medical.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.890
There's a gathering
of physicians

35:58.924 --> 36:00.426
from all over the world
happening.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.661
I suppose it's possible.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.897
But why now?

36:05.931 --> 36:08.600
Why when he's needed
so badly here?

36:08.634 --> 36:10.869
Germs travel, Doctor.

36:10.902 --> 36:14.306
Bigger crisis means
more vaccine.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.742
More medicine means more money.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.318
Tell me about the
convention in Jackson.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.387
An organization called
Doctors International Outreach.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.422
Doctors from around the globe
get together and share cases.

36:30.456 --> 36:31.957
And then they go home.

36:31.990 --> 36:35.661
Infected and carrying a bacteria
Hufcutt's company can medicate.

36:35.694 --> 36:36.928
Treating thousands of victims.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.664
The doctor's going global.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.233
And the clue trail
is next to impossible to track.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.834
Not if we can stop him.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.671
Dr. Hufcutt just turned his
cell phone on for a minute.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.306
I got him.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.007
Can you track it?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.376
I can do one better.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.844
I can run his ass off the road.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.870
NCIS. Where the hell do you
think you're going, Doctor?

37:18.904 --> 37:19.905
Hey, what are you doing?!
Huh?

37:19.938 --> 37:21.407
I didn't do anything.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.275
Let me go.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt,

37:23.309 --> 37:25.711
you are under arrest for murder

37:25.744 --> 37:27.746
and domestic terrorism.
What?

37:27.779 --> 37:29.415
Where's the bacteria you stole?

37:29.448 --> 37:31.917
And be careful what you say,
because I might just ram it

37:31.950 --> 37:33.285
right down your
pathetic little throat.

37:33.319 --> 37:34.820
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.588
This is crazy! Let me go!

37:36.622 --> 37:38.056
Wait... Hey! Hey!

37:38.089 --> 37:39.291
Hey, you can't do this.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.592
Hey, whoa, whoa.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.994
Stop! I can't swim! No!

37:43.028 --> 37:44.930
No! Please.

37:44.963 --> 37:45.997
Please don't do this.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.866
I made a mistake.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.669
The bacteria's safe;
it's in the car.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.971
Aah!

37:53.004 --> 37:55.974
King.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.710
Please.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.463
BRODY:
This place is kind of beautiful.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.997
I'm getting
some serious reading done.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.567
LASALLE:
Well, I'm getting some bites.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.403
A lot to be grateful for.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.805
People are healthy,

38:26.838 --> 38:29.508
bacteria's contained.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.343
Catfish don't know I'm using
my secret weapon.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.511
What is it?

38:32.544 --> 38:34.546
Moldy cheese and fatback.

38:34.580 --> 38:35.814
And you expect me

38:35.847 --> 38:37.115
to eat what you catch?

38:37.148 --> 38:39.918
If you don't, I will.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.420
Come on, baby.

38:41.453 --> 38:42.754
Come on.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.590
You know you want it.

38:44.623 --> 38:45.591
Take it.

38:45.624 --> 38:46.992
Come on, baby.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.760
Come to Daddy.
Come on now.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.896
I'm right here waiting for you.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.899
Is he really talking to that
fish like he's Barry White?

38:53.932 --> 38:55.066
LASALLE:
Come on.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.935
Called foreplay, Brody.

38:56.968 --> 39:00.338
Every good fisherman knows how
to tease with the best of them.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.520
This is Pride.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.557
One marine's been shot?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.562
Call the morgue.

39:24.430 --> 39:25.864
We'll reach out to the family.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.899
This is an NCIS case now.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.443
And we're back to work.

39:37.476 --> 39:40.679
Captioning sponsored by
CBS
