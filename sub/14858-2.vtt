08:47.902 --> 08:49.518
So it's gonna be 45 to an hour.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.028
Okay, let's roll.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.859
No, but wait,
this place is special.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.524
let's talk.
The time will fly by.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.317
Okay, fine.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.860
What's up?

08:59.164 --> 09:03.032
Well, why don't you tell me
your deepest fear?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.075
While we wait for a table
at a restaurant?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.664
Okay, I'll start.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.000
| guess my deepest fear
is that you die first

09:09.299 --> 09:11.757
and our condo goes
all Grey Gardens on me,

09:12.052 --> 09:13.588
and I spend
the last decade of my life

09:13.887 --> 09:15.548
nursing a leg wound
that won't heal

09:15.847 --> 09:18.088
and feeding stray cats
from my mouth.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.845
Yeah. Your turn.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.978
Wow. Uh, all right, um,
sharks.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.479
What? No, come on, seriously.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.984
Okay, fine, ghosts.
Of sharks.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.064
Ghost sharks?
Ghost sharks? Really?

09:32.363 --> 09:34.400
Yeah, it could happen.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.440
What do we know
about this guy?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.780
First name's Bo.
He's got a great physique.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.035
Loves to rollerblade.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.866
Chiseled features,
kissable lips.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.997
Just like a handsome dude in a
classic sense.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.327
Come on, that is not...

09:45.627 --> 09:47.459
That's not helping.
Not helping you.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.121
It's helping my spank bank.
Wait, wait.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.211
Alex said they
flirted a little at work.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.796
I'll bet
he did some work for her

09:55.095 --> 09:56.551
at her work,
at her store.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.757
Yes, like modeling
or something physical,

09:59.057 --> 10:00.218
like roofing

10:00.517 --> 10:03.930
or maybe carrying me
across a river.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.472
Okay, so the secret to a good
hollandaise is sensuality.

10:07.774 --> 10:08.980
Oh. Right.
And cumin.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.232
I'm just gonna grab this
right over here.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.484
Excuse me.
Sorry.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.985
Okay. Let me just pinch it,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.112
and we put it right in
with our forefingers

10:16.407 --> 10:19.024
and then we just put it
right back over here.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.910
Okay, I like it right
on the edge of the table.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.162
Salt.
Ha, ha. How much salt...

10:24.457 --> 10:26.494
You've gotta grind it.
Penny, you're right.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.908
This is lame,
let's get out.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.667
What”? No, I'm having fun.
What?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.204
He is an architect named John.
That is a top-two job

10:32.507 --> 10:34.168
and my third favorite name.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.175
What are the chances I'm gonna
meet a point guard named Adam?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.006
Can I at least join you guys?
Mm-mm.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.966
Listen, I'll be your wingman.
No.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.973
No, you are
the worst wingman ever.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.679
John, this is fun, right?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.969
To be honest, I usually
never go out with Penny

10:47.272 --> 10:48.228
because all the cute guys

10:48.523 --> 10:50.105
always go home with her
instead of me.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.640
| mean, not that she goes home
with a lot of dudes.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.776
She's not slutty.
She's not a prude, either.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.311
Okay.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.151
In conclusion, she has
a very healthy sexual curiosity.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.440
What's wrong with you?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.484
So who turned you on
to the class?

11:02.787 --> 11:04.494
Uh, my wife.
Well, ex-wife.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.702
Wow. That"s the first time
I've said that, ex-wife.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.833
I'm so sorry.
Did you just split?

11:10.128 --> 11:12.995
Like a long time ago?
Well, it was like a month ago.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.585
DAVE: This is the
back door to Alex's store.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.252
Real quick,
real simple, simple B&E.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.794
Whoa, man,
what are you doing?

11:21.097 --> 11:22.383

11:22.682 --> 11:25.094
| got the keys, man.
Well, then it's not a B&E.

gonna reach.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.236

11:38.531 --> 11:39.771
Are all the sizes
on the floor,

11:40.074 --> 11:41.485
or does Alex have
more in the back?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.274

he lived on Western.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.336
| had a boyfriend
who lived there.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.717
He's in a biker gang.

What would Seagal do
in this situation?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.521
Well, I think
it's pretty cut and dry.

Mm-hm.

Okay, here we go.
Oh, come on.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.274
They got here like
20 minutes after us.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.230
This is because
we're black on blonde.

next to each other

will grow between our grave

13:13.209 --> 13:15.246

first kiss under it.

Yeah, it does.

kissing in a graveyard?
