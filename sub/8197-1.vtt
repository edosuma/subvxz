02:21.733 --> 02:26.709
Thís 1916 portraít shows us
Ty Cobb ín hís Detroít Tígers uníform...

02:26.939 --> 02:28.441
''the Georgía Peach.''

02:28.507 --> 02:31.747
Note the smug expressíon
and the hauntíng set of eyes.

02:32.144 --> 02:36.853
These dísturbíng eyes can be seen
ín the earlíest photo ever taken of young Ty.

02:40.753 --> 02:44.160
Here, we see the famous swíng
of the great Ty Cobb.

02:44.723 --> 02:47.329
Turn the clock back
to the begínníng of the century...

02:47.393 --> 02:50.132
when Ameríca fírst embraced baseball...

02:50.296 --> 02:53.836
and the exchangíng of the ground rules
became a pre-game rítual...

02:53.900 --> 02:55.903
that survíves to thís day.

02:55.969 --> 02:59.743
At that tíme, professíonal baseball
was a casual game...

02:59.806 --> 03:01.476
wíth a círcus atmosphere.

03:01.542 --> 03:04.047
Baseball players were often clowns...

03:04.111 --> 03:07.283
and pre-game antícs
took on the flavor of vaudevílle.

03:07.582 --> 03:10.688
But young Ty Cobb
would have none of that.

03:10.785 --> 03:13.390
He turned the game ínto war...

03:13.455 --> 03:16.995
and ín the process,
ínvented the modern game as we know ít.

03:17.059 --> 03:20.331
Here, we see hím runníng
over a fírst sacker on a drag bunt:

03:20.395 --> 03:22.265
a play he perfected.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.804
The aggressíve, attackíng game
was vírtually Cobb's ínventíon.

03:25.868 --> 03:29.642
lnfíelders and catchers often bled
from hís spíkes.

03:29.705 --> 03:34.347
Cobb would fíght any man on or off
the fíeld at the drop of a hat.

03:34.443 --> 03:36.079
Battíng champíon 12 tímes...

03:36.145 --> 03:39.952
he averaged over .300
for 23 consecutíve years...

03:40.016 --> 03:43.155
and averaged over .400
for a fíve-year stretch.

03:43.219 --> 03:46.058
Hís lífetíme battíng average of .367...

03:46.122 --> 03:48.794
has never been seríously approached.

03:48.858 --> 03:51.763
The fírst celebríty athlete
ín Amerícan hístory...

03:51.828 --> 03:55.569
movíe stars and presídents
all sought hís company.

03:55.632 --> 03:58.839
Here Cobb poses wíth hís great archríval...

03:58.969 --> 04:00.939
the legendary Babe Ruth.

04:01.739 --> 04:04.811
Here we see Cobb
wíth one of hís fíve chíldren:

04:05.243 --> 04:07.280
hís líttle daughter Shírley.

04:07.878 --> 04:10.851
Here, he poses wíth some kíds
from the neíghborhood.

04:10.916 --> 04:14.757
And, here, he shows hís son
hís curíous hands-apart gríp.

04:14.886 --> 04:18.726
Though he was unable to teach
hís flamíng, competítíve heart.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.529
Charged wíth fíxíng games ín 1926...

04:21.593 --> 04:25.400
Cobb was roundly supported
by the chíldren of Ameríca...

04:25.564 --> 04:28.503
who came to the great batsman's defense.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.308
The supposed scandal proved to be
much ado about nothíng...

04:32.371 --> 04:36.078
when baseball commíssíoner Judge Landís
fully acquítted the Georgía Peach...

04:36.142 --> 04:37.945
of all wrongdoíng.

04:38.378 --> 04:42.185
...that ís the very backbone of Ameríca ítself.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.820
Near the end of hís career...

04:44.885 --> 04:48.892
Cobb joíned the Phíladelphía Athletícs,
and at the age oF 41...

04:48.956 --> 04:53.498
he batted .323 and retíred shortly thereafter,
tellíng the world:

04:53.661 --> 04:57.268
''lf a man can't hít better than that,
he ought to quít.''

04:58.166 --> 05:02.007
Ty Cobb domínated the game
as no man ever had.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.874
Yes, ladíes and gentlemen...

05:04.939 --> 05:06.642
what a ballplayer!

05:17.752 --> 05:19.122
Hey, Stump.

05:39.375 --> 05:40.811
Stumpy!

05:41.545 --> 05:42.580
Gentlemen.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.783
Get over here. We've got to settle this.

05:44.848 --> 05:46.551
Stump! Come on!

05:46.616 --> 05:47.987
Congrats, Al.

05:48.052 --> 05:50.689
Four pieces in national magazines
this month.

05:50.754 --> 05:51.890
Five.

05:52.256 --> 05:54.226
You're the man, Stumpy.

05:54.692 --> 05:57.798
Stumpy, 3:45, you're late.
Where have you been?

05:57.862 --> 06:00.166
Stumpy, best fighter, pound for pound?

06:00.231 --> 06:02.369
Joe Louis, a champ for 11 years.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.373
Walker Smith, Jr.
better known to you dileítantes...

06:05.436 --> 06:08.109
as Sugar Ray Robinson.

06:08.173 --> 06:10.043
For Christ's sake, retired undefeated....

06:10.108 --> 06:14.517
Henry Armstrong held three titles
at the same time.

06:14.580 --> 06:16.282
No other fighter....

06:17.716 --> 06:21.023
We call ourselves writers,
and all we do is watch ball games...

06:21.087 --> 06:23.291
argue about everything,
and just get drunk a lot.

06:23.356 --> 06:24.992
-You call that writing?
-Yeah!

06:25.624 --> 06:29.264
Besides, Alan here
is writing a serious novel, aren't you?

06:29.829 --> 06:32.768
Well, l haven't started yet, but l'm going to.

06:32.832 --> 06:35.237
-l've been very busy--
-By the end of the century....

06:36.303 --> 06:40.310
You're pathetic!
The only reason you write is for a paycheck.

06:40.374 --> 06:43.413
Besides, greatest fighter,
Harry Greb, 294 fights, no contest.

06:43.476 --> 06:44.746
The guy killed everybody.

06:44.812 --> 06:47.551
My ass! He couldn't beat Harry Belafonte.

06:47.748 --> 06:49.918
Belafonte, best singer, male.

06:49.983 --> 06:51.119
-Elvis.
-Perry Como.

06:51.184 --> 06:54.158
Three words! Francis Albert Sinatra.

06:54.222 --> 06:56.459
What about Nat ''King'' Cole?

06:56.524 --> 06:58.394
Best king. l've got Henry Vlll...

06:58.459 --> 07:00.462
who started a new religion
and had six wives--

07:00.528 --> 07:02.398
King James had a Bible named after him.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.933
Stump! The phone!

07:03.998 --> 07:06.337
-King, Bible--
-King David.

07:06.735 --> 07:08.738
King David, best Jew.

07:10.239 --> 07:12.409
Best king? King Kong!

07:13.409 --> 07:14.778
Best monkey.

07:21.050 --> 07:23.320
Who? Who?

07:30.327 --> 07:32.230
Yes, sir, l certainly would.

07:36.399 --> 07:37.869
Yes, sir, l can.

07:38.569 --> 07:40.171
Yes, sir. Fine, thank you.

07:50.148 --> 07:52.151
Cobb wants to see me.

07:52.216 --> 07:54.754
-Cobb who?
-Ty Cobb. How many Cobbs do you know?

07:54.819 --> 07:57.023
Cobb? But Cobb is dead.

07:57.422 --> 07:58.557
Not yet, he ain't.

07:58.623 --> 08:01.962
And he wants to tell me the real story
of his life before he croaks.

08:02.027 --> 08:04.097
That was Ty Cobb on the phone right there?

08:04.163 --> 08:05.431
l heard he killed a man.

08:05.497 --> 08:08.035
Stumpy, he's crazy, he's meshuga.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.872
Stumpy, listen to me.
You've got to be careful with Cobb.

08:10.936 --> 08:13.841
Come on, the guy's over 70.
Is he going to wheeze on me?

08:13.906 --> 08:17.480
l think l can handle him.
Besides, he wants to see me.

08:17.576 --> 08:20.516
Cobb wants to see me!
Greatest ballplayer of all time.

08:20.579 --> 08:22.851
-Ty Cobb!
-Ty Cobb!

08:22.916 --> 08:24.686
-Ty Cobb.
-l like Ruth.

08:24.751 --> 08:26.888
-Ruth?
-Babe Ruth.

08:26.953 --> 08:28.656
Ever heard of him?

08:39.466 --> 08:41.602
Cobb owned property all over the country.

08:41.669 --> 08:44.340
Of late, he had been
stayíng ín hís huntíng lodge...

08:44.405 --> 08:46.610
at Lake Tahoe ín the Síerra Nevadas.

08:48.042 --> 08:51.649
Storíes of Cobb sharpeníng hís spíkes
before a game were as famílíar as...

08:51.712 --> 08:53.650
George Washíngton and hís cherry tree...

08:53.714 --> 08:56.620
or Teddy Roosevelt
chargíng up San Juan Híll.

08:56.985 --> 09:01.026
l also knew hís reputatíon for beíng díffícult
at best, psychotíc at worst.

09:02.057 --> 09:04.662
By hís own admíssíon,
he set out to hurt hís opponents.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.400
ln one season alone,
he sent 12 men to the hospítal.

10:06.792 --> 10:09.598
Bullshit! Go ahead and quit then, Willie!

10:10.162 --> 10:11.632
Go ahead and quit!

10:11.797 --> 10:13.234
Get the hell out of here!

10:13.299 --> 10:15.404
Now, Mr. Cobb, you racist! Fuck you!

10:15.468 --> 10:19.542
You ain't no greatest baseball player!
My ass plays better baseball than you!

10:19.606 --> 10:21.676
l'm out of here! You ain't got to tell me.

10:21.742 --> 10:23.411
Now, fuck you, Mr. Cobb!

10:23.476 --> 10:26.381
l have too much dignity to spend
another moment with you.

10:26.447 --> 10:30.120
l hope you die before the sun comes up,
and may you rot in hell!

10:30.183 --> 10:32.086
Excuse me. Who are you?

10:32.520 --> 10:33.688
l'm the writer.

10:33.754 --> 10:36.593
You mean, he actually found someone
to take the job?

10:36.657 --> 10:37.725
Write all you've got...

10:37.792 --> 10:40.429
he makes somebody dance
Yankee Doodle Dandy on his ass.

10:40.494 --> 10:43.099
l'm out of here.
l've never seen nobody like that before.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.736
Go on!
You'll never last a day with that old bastard!

10:45.833 --> 10:47.069
You're gonna write that shit?

10:47.135 --> 10:49.673
Talking about
''he's the greatest player of all time.''

10:49.738 --> 10:51.976
My ass play better baseball than him!

10:52.041 --> 10:54.745
l'm out of here.
l'm never gonna work for you no more!

10:54.810 --> 10:56.078
Don't ask me to come back!

10:56.145 --> 10:58.082
l'm free, and l'm glad to be out of here.

10:58.147 --> 11:00.084
This is America, you old motherfucker!

11:00.149 --> 11:01.719
Freedom!

11:01.784 --> 11:04.054
This is the land of ''Oh, say can you see.''

11:04.153 --> 11:06.157
Kiss my ass with a....

11:23.340 --> 11:24.642
Mr. Cobb?

11:30.715 --> 11:33.419
-Mr. Cobb?
-Where's that sportswriter at?

11:39.624 --> 11:40.625
Mr. Cobb?

12:08.921 --> 12:10.525
Hello, Mr. Cobb.

12:12.292 --> 12:15.431
Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb,
but l don't need this job that bad.

12:18.031 --> 12:21.037
Yes, Mr. Stump,
you do need this job that bad.

12:21.101 --> 12:24.173
Now, come on in here
and meet the great Ty Cobb!

12:26.641 --> 12:28.411
Oh, man, he's nuts.

12:30.478 --> 12:32.148
Don't let him get you.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.650
l won't hurt you. Come on.

12:45.727 --> 12:47.330
l won't hurt you.

12:49.498 --> 12:51.101
Come on in here.

12:57.607 --> 12:59.944
On the violin, Fritz Kreisler.

13:01.644 --> 13:03.748
l'm a great admirer of his.

13:12.355 --> 13:14.793
l'm also a great admirer of yours.

13:14.858 --> 13:16.193
Thank you.

13:17.961 --> 13:20.031
You are a hopeless romantic...

13:20.497 --> 13:23.103
and only a moderate success, however.

13:24.168 --> 13:26.672
Sir, l'm the highest-paid sportswriter
in America...

13:26.738 --> 13:29.175
and not merely a ''moderate success.''

13:29.240 --> 13:30.610
Of course.

13:31.142 --> 13:34.181
Hand me those green and white pills
right there, please.

14:04.143 --> 14:07.784
That is an invitation
to a testimonial dinner...

14:07.848 --> 14:10.486
at the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.223
Young man, you're gonna take me there.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.431
When is it?

14:23.030 --> 14:24.400
ln a few weeks.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.803
All the great ones are gonna be there!

14:27.869 --> 14:31.376
The great Mickey Cochrane,
''Wahoo'' Sam Crawford...

14:31.439 --> 14:34.645
Jimmie Foxx, Rogers Hornsby,
the Waner boys....

14:34.710 --> 14:36.847
Goddamn, we used to have
some parties, Stump.

14:36.912 --> 14:39.349
l'm gonna tell you that right now.

14:48.357 --> 14:49.960
We can't forget.

14:51.227 --> 14:52.763
l won't forget.

14:58.968 --> 15:00.971
Look at me closely, Al.

15:01.638 --> 15:04.610
Lie after lie has been told about me.

15:05.242 --> 15:07.847
My entire life, l've been misunderstood.

15:08.645 --> 15:11.985
You are the very fortunate
young sportswriter...

15:12.249 --> 15:15.121
who has been chosen to tell the true story...

15:15.185 --> 15:16.621
of Ty Cobb.

15:16.787 --> 15:20.261
-Great. What's the true story?
-That's why you're here.

15:20.391 --> 15:22.561
See, there's two kinds of writers in this life.

15:22.626 --> 15:26.001
Ones that spin endless yarns
about tiny little subjects, that's you...

15:26.064 --> 15:27.634
and the ones with one big subiect...

15:27.699 --> 15:30.571
that consumes them forever,
that could be you...

15:30.635 --> 15:32.873
because l am that subiect.

15:57.597 --> 15:59.100
Are you okay?

15:59.332 --> 16:00.601
Jameson!

16:03.370 --> 16:05.207
Jameson, get your ass up here.

16:07.107 --> 16:08.210
Sir?

16:19.320 --> 16:22.927
There's a small oil company
in Bakersfield near Elk Hills Reserve...

16:22.991 --> 16:24.861
called Honolulu Oil Company.

16:24.926 --> 16:26.896
You buy all the stock in it that you can.

16:26.961 --> 16:30.201
Getty's expanding,
l'm looking for little companies like that.

16:30.265 --> 16:33.037
l've got a hunch.
Stump, come over here to me.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.942
l think l can take that buck.
What do you think?

16:38.007 --> 16:40.612
With that pistol, l don't believe so.

16:41.444 --> 16:43.581
There's a board meeting at
Coca-Cola in Atlanta.

16:43.646 --> 16:45.649
Tell them l can't make it
for medical reasons.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.888
No, personal reasons.
And sell everything l've got in 3M.

16:53.156 --> 16:54.157
Got him!

16:54.223 --> 16:55.560
Like hell you did!

16:55.626 --> 16:58.531
-l shot her damn throat out!
-You are so full of shit!

16:58.595 --> 17:00.332
lf Mr. Cobb says he got him, he got him.

17:00.397 --> 17:01.832
Then you're full of shit, too.

17:01.898 --> 17:05.238
You have no goddamn vision.
A writer with no vision is a waste of time.

17:05.301 --> 17:07.204
l've hired the wrong son of a bitch.

17:08.105 --> 17:11.744
l better head back to San Francisco
before the storm hits.

17:12.609 --> 17:14.512
l'll take care of these transactions.

17:14.579 --> 17:18.353
And l will be leaving, too, since you think
l'm the wrong man for the job.

17:18.415 --> 17:21.121
Shut up, Stump,
we both know l'm your meal ticket.

17:21.185 --> 17:22.888
l beg your pardon?

17:23.288 --> 17:25.058
We need each other.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.127
We'll start in the morning.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.629
No!

17:29.695 --> 17:31.632
Yeah, bright and early.

17:36.302 --> 17:39.107
Mr. Cobb, l don't think
l've made myself perfectly clear.

17:39.906 --> 17:41.743
Mr. Cobb!

17:49.383 --> 17:50.785
Ready.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.063
Chapter 1, page 1.

18:01.795 --> 18:02.998
Ready!

18:04.565 --> 18:08.205
''Know ye that a prince and a great man
has fallen this day.''

18:11.105 --> 18:12.475
What the hell is that?

18:12.540 --> 18:17.016
That is what Robert Lee said over the grave
of my grandfather at Fredericksburg.

18:17.546 --> 18:18.781
So l'm taking notes?

18:18.847 --> 18:21.485
Hell no,
it's the first line of my autobiography.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.153
-l'm not writing that.
-Why not?

18:23.219 --> 18:24.854
lt's horseshit.

18:25.587 --> 18:28.793
lt's a third-person comment
about somebody who's already dead.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.562
An autobiography has to be
in the first person...

18:31.626 --> 18:34.500
plus it can't come from the other side
of the goddamn grave.

18:34.564 --> 18:36.601
My story can come
from any damn place l want.

18:36.666 --> 18:37.934
Not to mention the fact...

18:38.000 --> 18:41.039
you can't call yourself
a prince and a great man.

18:41.104 --> 18:42.105
That's for the--

18:42.172 --> 18:45.344
What kind of a writer are you,
tied up in rules and regulations?

18:45.408 --> 18:47.846
What's the use of a writer
if you can't say what want?

18:47.911 --> 18:51.652
You're not treating me like a writer,
you're treating me like a stenographer.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.958
''...that a prince and a great man...

18:59.490 --> 19:01.962
''has fallen this day.''

19:02.226 --> 19:05.231
-lt has a certain ring to it.
-lt certainly does.

19:05.296 --> 19:08.770
And l thought you might like it.
It's yours, it's a gift.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.503
From me.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.442
''Cobb...

19:18.376 --> 19:20.414
I I
a prince among men...

19:22.281 --> 19:25.253
''misunderstood in his genius...

19:26.486 --> 19:28.923
''as genius always is....''

19:29.922 --> 19:31.959
That's the second line
from what's gonna be...

19:32.024 --> 19:34.496
the greatest biography
of a great man ever written.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.363
Type the damn thing up!

19:40.300 --> 19:44.642
Bethlehem Steel is going in the toilet.
l'll be a striped-ass ape!

19:47.308 --> 19:50.948
Jameson, Bethlehem Steel's
going in the toilet. Dump it all right now.

19:54.782 --> 19:56.886
You got a stock tip for me?

19:57.184 --> 19:59.422
Buy Coca-Cola.
We're about to go out in cans.

19:59.487 --> 20:02.459
Coke in cans? l don't believe so.

20:15.737 --> 20:17.441
You know what's wrong with Ty Cobb?

20:17.506 --> 20:19.943
Every goddamn disease known to man,
l've got them all.

20:20.008 --> 20:22.580
But they ain't never gonna get me
into a hospital.

20:22.645 --> 20:26.085
My heart leaks. My doctors, nothin' but
a bunch of hacksaw artists...

20:26.149 --> 20:28.653
give me Digoxin to keep it pumping.

20:29.618 --> 20:32.123
They give me Darvon
for the cancer in my back.

20:32.188 --> 20:35.595
They give me Tace
for something eating up my stomach.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.798
They give me Fleets compound
for an infection in my bowels!

20:38.862 --> 20:42.169
They give me Librium for my tension.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.137
They give me insulin for diabetes.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.840
But this stuff....

20:51.308 --> 20:53.111
This stuff, Stumpy...

20:54.545 --> 20:56.382
can fucking kill you.

21:13.865 --> 21:15.101
And if that wasn't enough...

21:15.167 --> 21:18.673
it's been two years
since l got my pecker up in the air.

21:23.109 --> 21:26.683
The South may not rise again, young man,
but my dick will.

21:44.998 --> 21:47.803
l soon díscovered
l couldn't be around the man for long...

21:47.868 --> 21:52.010
wíthout needíng a break,
whích hís paínkíllers gracefully províded.

21:53.107 --> 21:56.379
My saníty would soon depend
upon a frequent breath of fresh aír...

21:56.444 --> 22:00.586
a walk ín the woods, any escape
from what one sportswríter had called:

22:00.649 --> 22:03.955
''Cobb's broodíng soul,
that bubbled wíth víolence.''

22:19.368 --> 22:20.738
Oh, my God!

22:36.853 --> 22:39.858
Good news, Stumpy.
We're going to Reno. l'm horny.

22:39.924 --> 22:41.393
There's a blizzard out there!

22:41.458 --> 22:44.463
When a man wants a woman,
a man wants a woman!

22:44.662 --> 22:48.101
Why don't we put on some soup?
We'll build a fire, work on the book.

22:48.165 --> 22:49.300
How cozy.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.071
Got $25,OOO in cash
and negotiable securities right there.

22:52.136 --> 22:53.772
Don't let it out of your sight.

22:53.838 --> 22:55.943
You're nuts! Those roads are impassable!

22:56.008 --> 22:58.245
-You lead, l'll follow.
-You don't understand.

22:58.310 --> 23:02.217
-l'm not going anywhere!
-You don't understand. l need a woman.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.565
Get the hell out of the way!

23:27.307 --> 23:30.446
You call that driving, Alice?
My sister can drive better than that!

23:30.510 --> 23:32.247
Step on it! Let's go!

23:32.312 --> 23:33.380
Get on down the road.

23:33.446 --> 23:36.352
Them girls are gonna die of old age
before we get down there.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.886
Are you nuts?

23:51.666 --> 23:52.802
Get off my ass!

23:53.835 --> 23:56.072
All right, little girl, l'll take you to school.

24:06.515 --> 24:09.120
How was your first driving lesson, Alice?

24:26.236 --> 24:27.906
Couldn't take it?

24:28.238 --> 24:29.474
Too bad.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.212
Shit!

24:37.848 --> 24:39.551
Driving lesson number two!

24:39.617 --> 24:41.387
Step on it, will you?

25:07.045 --> 25:10.720
All right, young man. Follow the leader!
We're gonna get laid!

25:12.185 --> 25:14.689
Go ahead! Just go!

25:16.055 --> 25:17.291
Fuck you!

25:18.324 --> 25:20.529
''Good news, Stumpy. l'm horny.''

25:23.029 --> 25:25.768
Better news, Cobb. You're fucking crazy!

25:39.647 --> 25:42.552
Oh, boy. What the hell is that?

25:58.201 --> 26:00.438
Oh, God. He's dead.

26:00.802 --> 26:02.439
Ty Cobb bought the farm.

26:24.995 --> 26:27.032
lt's about fucking time you got here.

26:27.097 --> 26:28.600
You're alive?

26:28.733 --> 26:31.037
l wouldn't call it living, but it'll do.

26:31.101 --> 26:32.971
Help me out of this son of a bitch!

26:33.038 --> 26:34.140
Give me your hand.

26:34.205 --> 26:36.843
-God, there's blood.
-Of course there's blood.

26:36.908 --> 26:40.047
l just put my head through the windshield
of a goddamn car!

26:40.111 --> 26:42.983
What do you expect?
Oh, my God! l'm maimed!

26:43.048 --> 26:46.020
-Am l gonna be--
-Shut the fuck up and get in the car!

26:46.318 --> 26:47.820
Look at that!

26:48.520 --> 26:50.056
Get in the fucking car!

26:50.122 --> 26:53.394
-Stupid bastard. Come on, let's go!
-You gotta get me out of here.

26:53.459 --> 26:56.565
Let's get out of here! Just hold on to me.

26:56.862 --> 26:58.967
Let's go. Come on!

26:59.431 --> 27:02.437
Let's get out of here. Stump, lead on!

27:03.102 --> 27:04.438
Come on!

27:04.804 --> 27:07.042
-Oh, shit!
-Ruined a pair of gloves, shit!

27:07.774 --> 27:09.010
Look at that!

27:09.076 --> 27:12.315
No goddamn guardrail! l'm gonna sue
the State Highway Commission!

27:12.378 --> 27:14.851
l'm suing the governor,
l'm suing every-goddamn-body!

27:14.915 --> 27:16.752
Stumpy, l could've been hurt up here!

27:16.817 --> 27:19.021
You could have been hurt? Get in the car!

27:19.086 --> 27:21.324
-Give me the keys, l'm driving.
-No, l'm driving!

27:21.388 --> 27:25.096
You know the way to Reno? No!
Give me the keys, l'm driving!

27:25.159 --> 27:29.066
-Over my dead body!
-That's your call, young man.

27:29.130 --> 27:31.133
Now, no sudden moves.

27:31.532 --> 27:33.369
You miserable son of a bitch!

27:33.434 --> 27:36.507
You frightened, desperate, pathetic old man!
Get out of here!

27:36.571 --> 27:38.675
You can't do anything without that gun...

27:38.740 --> 27:42.114
and frankly, it doesn't impress me
if you keep waving it around...

27:42.177 --> 27:44.247
because l know you're not gonna shoot me!

27:44.313 --> 27:47.820
You need me a lot worse than l need you!
What, are you gonna kill me?

27:47.883 --> 27:49.185
l killed a man one time!

27:49.251 --> 27:51.889
Fine, then shoot me
and put me out of my fucking misery...

27:51.954 --> 27:53.357
because l'm freezing!

27:53.422 --> 27:57.130
Okay, Stumpy, that's good.
l like a man who stands up to me.

27:57.193 --> 27:58.862
That's good, son.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.400
-Come on, let's go.
-Give me the keys, l'm driving.

28:11.275 --> 28:15.116
lt's only an hour. l can tell you my story
before we get to those women.

28:15.179 --> 28:16.814
Women? Plural?

28:16.881 --> 28:19.953
Some for me and some for you.
We're gonna have a hell of a time.

28:20.017 --> 28:22.589
l bet them girls are lining up now
for ol' Ty and Stump.

28:22.654 --> 28:25.526
Why don't you worry less about women
and stay on the road?

28:25.590 --> 28:28.963
My philosophy is simply this.
Life is too short to be diplomatic.

28:29.026 --> 28:31.498
A man's friends should not care
what he does or says.

28:31.563 --> 28:33.733
Those who are not his friends,
to hell with them.

28:33.798 --> 28:35.234
You wanna know about my childhood?

28:35.300 --> 28:37.237
That's what writers
usually wanna know about.

28:37.302 --> 28:41.511
Fine, but none of this ''know ye that a prince
and great man has fallen'' stuff.

28:41.574 --> 28:43.678
l was born in a small town in north Georgia.

28:43.742 --> 28:45.712
My daughter lives there to this day.

28:45.777 --> 28:48.483
l started playing baseball as a kid,
like everybody else.

28:48.547 --> 28:51.552
-But l was better than everybody else.
-Watch!

28:53.352 --> 28:56.525
l started playing for money when l was 17.
Father didn't approve.

28:56.590 --> 28:59.362
Fathers will be that way. Watch the road.

29:00.493 --> 29:02.397
Father was a great man.

29:07.968 --> 29:11.307
He was also a learned man, a professor.

29:12.005 --> 29:16.749
He was beíng groomed for governor
from the day ín 1900 he was elected mayor.

29:16.977 --> 29:19.682
...Franklin County politics, and l will deliver.

29:20.648 --> 29:23.153
l promise that City Hall will be....

29:23.218 --> 29:25.522
He was the píllar of franklín County.

29:25.586 --> 29:29.493
Head Deacon ín the Baptíst church.
My father was everythíng.

29:29.558 --> 29:34.935
Blood drawn from Emmanuel's veíns

29:35.530 --> 29:38.303
And sínners plunged

29:38.367 --> 29:41.139
ínto that flood

29:42.337 --> 29:45.745
My mother was the most beautíful woman
ín the county.

29:46.242 --> 29:50.551
She marríed my father when she was 12,
whích was the way they used to do ít.

29:50.613 --> 29:53.752
And she taught me to belíeve ín the hymns
we sang ín church.

29:53.816 --> 29:57.089
l especíally líked the bloody ones.

29:58.054 --> 30:02.798
''And the sínners plunged beneath that flood
Iose all theír guílty staíns.''

30:05.663 --> 30:09.237
ln the name oF the father, the Son...

30:09.300 --> 30:12.339
and the Holy Ghost, l was baptízed.

30:12.569 --> 30:14.640
And a short tíme later...

30:14.705 --> 30:17.210
walkíng home wíth my pals...

30:17.942 --> 30:19.945
feelíng very Chrístían...

30:20.645 --> 30:22.815
ready to líve the good lífe...

30:24.081 --> 30:27.422
my father dídn't drínk, smoke,
gamble, or chase women...

30:27.486 --> 30:29.756
and l wasn't goíng to, eíther.

30:31.356 --> 30:33.059
All of a sudden...

30:35.327 --> 30:37.832
there was a traín comíng at us...

30:38.798 --> 30:40.768
on the southbound track.

30:43.503 --> 30:47.912
There l was, a newly baptízed chíld of God...

30:47.974 --> 30:51.715
who hadn't hardly sínned,
and l was gonna díe.

30:52.879 --> 30:54.916
l felt strangely calm...

30:55.181 --> 30:59.122
and as the traín got closer,
l just stood there...

30:59.453 --> 31:02.859
and stood, and stood.

31:07.161 --> 31:09.231
Hell, l knew when to jump.

31:10.998 --> 31:13.670
That was the greatest thríll of my lífe...

31:13.735 --> 31:16.841
not countíng the fírst tíme
l saw a woman naked.

31:17.572 --> 31:21.279
l felt protected by my father...

31:21.709 --> 31:24.916
by my mother, the baptísm.

31:25.413 --> 31:28.452
l don't know, but From that moment on...

31:28.517 --> 31:31.689
l knew l could not be hurt.

31:37.426 --> 31:40.365
My father died in a terrible accident,
you know?

31:40.596 --> 31:42.066
No, l didn't.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.169
My father was murdered.

31:45.802 --> 31:47.939
lsn't that the kind of thing
you're looking for?

31:48.938 --> 31:49.939
Murdered.

31:50.407 --> 31:52.410
Your father was murdered?

31:52.576 --> 31:53.979
lt happened when l was 17...

31:54.044 --> 31:56.715
about three or four days
before Detroit called me up.

31:56.780 --> 32:01.089
-Was the killer ever caught?
-There was an arrest, trial, an acquittal...

32:01.151 --> 32:02.687
but never a conviction.

32:02.753 --> 32:05.425
Jesus Christ. l'm sorry.

32:05.489 --> 32:06.992
Don't give me that sob-sister crap.

32:07.057 --> 32:09.896
The only thing that matters
is a man's accomplishments.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.165
l must say, in all humility...

32:14.565 --> 32:19.341
l'm the greatest baseball player of all time.
Nobody even comes a close second.

32:21.272 --> 32:24.111
They say l used to sharpen my spíkes.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.582
Georgia Peach, my ass, you son of a bitch!

32:27.646 --> 32:29.783
You're gonna get hurt today,
you son of a bitch.

32:29.849 --> 32:32.587
You wanna do it right now, or out there?
Come on back here.

32:32.651 --> 32:33.754
But l ask you:

32:33.820 --> 32:38.228
Can you hurt a man worse by cuttíng hím up
wíth dull, rusty steel...

32:38.625 --> 32:41.497
or a fínely honed, razor-sharp edge?

32:41.928 --> 32:44.667
You could víew my efforts as humanítarían.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.468
Double left, steal third, steal home.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.701
-Eight to one.
-Bullshit!

32:47.767 --> 32:49.437
-Ten to one.
.$1oo.

32:49.602 --> 32:53.343
Leroy, come and hold this man's money.
You ain't going to be holding it long.

32:57.878 --> 33:00.048
What in the hell is going on in this dugout?

33:00.114 --> 33:02.151
Where did all these newspapers come from?

33:02.216 --> 33:04.486
What are you doing?
When did you learn how to read?

33:04.551 --> 33:07.491
Why don't you get your head
in the ballgame?

33:11.325 --> 33:14.265
Hello to each and every one of you.

33:38.521 --> 33:40.291
-Who signed you?
-Go to hell, Cobb.

33:40.356 --> 33:41.391
Who did that?

33:41.457 --> 33:43.562
Excellent day for a game of ball.

33:43.627 --> 33:45.630
-How do you do, Cyclops?
-Shut up, Cobb.

33:45.696 --> 33:47.766
You're missing an excellent ball game.

33:47.831 --> 33:49.334
By the way...

33:51.969 --> 33:55.241
your wife left these
in my automobile last night.

33:55.305 --> 33:57.911
l thought you might wanna
take them back to her.

33:57.975 --> 33:59.812
Let's see what we have on the mound today.

33:59.877 --> 34:01.914
-Play ball!
-Come along!

34:06.317 --> 34:08.255
Strike one!

34:09.754 --> 34:11.556
ls that all your boy has?

34:11.621 --> 34:14.228
This must be a hometown boy. Look at this.

34:14.292 --> 34:17.866
You better check your wife.
One of the ballplayers are missing.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.400
Come on, boy.

34:20.533 --> 34:22.536
You're going down, Cobb.

34:23.635 --> 34:24.637
Ball!

34:27.106 --> 34:29.176
ls that the fastest you can throw?

34:29.241 --> 34:32.014
lf l couldn't throw any better than that,
l'd wear a dress!

34:32.078 --> 34:34.516
lt's kind of tough hittin'
from your back, ain't it?

34:34.581 --> 34:37.386
That's the way your mother always liked it.

34:45.092 --> 34:46.092
Play ball!

35:06.715 --> 35:08.885
-Safe!
-Get out of here, boy!

35:11.887 --> 35:15.060
You should've thrown it at my head!
You should've tried to kill me!

35:15.124 --> 35:17.628
l hear you're from Georgia,
where the men are men...

35:17.692 --> 35:20.231
-and the sheep are nervous.
-Get back on that hill.

35:20.329 --> 35:22.499
l'm gonna steal third on you, young man.

35:22.564 --> 35:24.467
l'm coming down there!

35:56.300 --> 35:57.736
That's enough!

35:58.235 --> 35:59.772
Come on, Cobb!

36:04.476 --> 36:08.550
You want in on the action?
My grandmother throws better than that!

36:08.613 --> 36:11.720
-l'm coming down to kick your daggone ass!
-Come on!

36:11.784 --> 36:15.190
l should've stuck it in that bastard's ear
when l had a chance.

36:23.896 --> 36:25.799
He's going, he's going!

36:32.872 --> 36:33.874
Safe!

36:53.027 --> 36:54.163
Son of a bitch!

37:06.407 --> 37:10.182
ln those days, you dídn't hold hands
and dance wíth the men on the other teams.

37:10.246 --> 37:13.185
They were the enemy
and you fought wíth them.

37:13.682 --> 37:17.322
And l was the most hated man ín baseball.

37:18.454 --> 37:20.892
You know what ít's líke
to be booed líke that?

37:20.957 --> 37:23.662
lt feels wonde_ul!

37:23.893 --> 37:28.067
They couldn't líve wíthout me!
They came to the ball park to see me!

37:28.298 --> 37:32.339
fífty thousand fans tryíng to kíll me,
everywhere l went.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.941
l had so many death threats at one tíme...

37:35.005 --> 37:38.679
the cops had to patrol the outfíeld
and the stands, lookíng for snípers.

37:38.743 --> 37:40.112
l loved ít!

37:42.079 --> 37:44.184
Hey, Cobb! Just stay out of my game....

37:44.249 --> 37:46.152
Only great men are booed, Stump.

37:46.217 --> 37:49.423
Captaíns of índustry, presídents,
l knew them all.

37:49.988 --> 37:53.561
lt was a fact, ín those days,
that Woodrow Wílson had the best scotch...

37:53.625 --> 37:57.064
and used to ínvíte me to the Whíte House
to try ít out.

37:58.664 --> 38:02.171
lt was also a Fact
that Warren Hardíng had the best broads...

38:02.234 --> 38:03.869
and threw the best damn partíes.

38:03.935 --> 38:06.073
l can tell you ríght now
that Calvín Coolídge...

38:06.138 --> 38:09.077
and that stupíd cat of hís
weren't any fun at all.

38:10.576 --> 38:14.016
After World War Il, General George Patton
asked me for my autograph.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.217
Said he'd patterned himself after me.

38:16.283 --> 38:18.320
-You getting all this?
-l'll remember.

38:18.384 --> 38:21.791
-How come you don't write it down?
-Because l'm preparing to die.

38:21.854 --> 38:23.624
-l'm not ready to die.
-l'm not either!

38:23.690 --> 38:26.830
l'm going to Reno to get laid,
and you're gonna get laid.

38:26.893 --> 38:29.231
Maybe l don't want to get laid.

38:30.030 --> 38:31.400
You queer?

38:31.865 --> 38:33.868
-l'm married.
-l thought you were divorced.

38:33.934 --> 38:37.006
No, we're having a problem,
but we're talking it out.

38:37.071 --> 38:40.043
''Talking.'' Shit. Quit hanging on.
Get you a divorce.

38:40.108 --> 38:41.743
That why you won't get laid in Reno?

38:41.810 --> 38:44.214
You're feeling loyal to a woman
you're gonna divorce?

38:44.278 --> 38:46.181
That's pretty stupid, Stumpy.

38:46.380 --> 38:49.119
l'm not getting a divorce. l'm being loyal.

38:49.183 --> 38:51.788
That's why you wined and dined
the little brunette...

38:51.853 --> 38:54.993
who had the office across the courtyard
from you in Santa Barbara?

38:55.057 --> 38:57.428
-What do you know about her?
-l do my homework.

38:57.492 --> 39:00.130
-lt didn't last long.
-You don't have to explain.

39:00.195 --> 39:03.969
When it comes to women, l'm a total shit.
The difference is, l know l'm a shit.

39:04.032 --> 39:06.638
-Nobody knows about the brunette!
-lt's our secret.

39:06.702 --> 39:09.841
The part about me being a shit with women
ain't going in the book.

39:09.905 --> 39:13.212
-l gotta put your family in my book.
-Your book? My book!

39:13.276 --> 39:16.582
Nothing about my ex-wives
or my children is gonna be in it.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.951
-My book is about baseball.
-My book is about Cobb.

39:19.015 --> 39:21.018
Cobb is baseball!

39:22.051 --> 39:23.053
Look.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.390
What is that?

39:25.889 --> 39:27.659
-That's a man!
-Fuck him.

39:27.724 --> 39:29.194
Stop the car.

39:30.961 --> 39:34.268
Whoever it is,
gotta be pretty stupid to be out in this shit.

39:34.331 --> 39:36.501
Why? We're out in this shit.

39:45.043 --> 39:48.884
Come on! Get in the car.
What the hell are you doing out here?

39:50.115 --> 39:52.385
-lt's you!
-lt's the writer!

39:52.450 --> 39:54.353
-Get in the damn car.
-Thank you.

39:54.419 --> 39:56.624
l can't believe you found me.

39:59.425 --> 40:02.430
l told you, you wouldn't last a day
with that bastard.

40:04.797 --> 40:06.400
Cobb's in the car. He's driving.

40:06.465 --> 40:10.406
Mr. Cobb's in the car? l ain't getting
in the car with that son of a bitch.

40:10.469 --> 40:11.672
-l'd rather--
-Get in the car!

40:11.738 --> 40:14.944
-He hates me. He hates colored people.
-He hates all fucking people!

40:15.007 --> 40:17.346
Don't give him the satisfaction
of dying out here.

40:17.411 --> 40:20.483
lf dying out here gives him pleasure,
then l won't die out here.

40:26.687 --> 40:28.757
lt's Willie. We'll get him over to town.

40:28.823 --> 40:31.862
l ain't taking that nigger anywhere.
Get your ass out of here.

40:31.926 --> 40:33.929
Shut the fuck up and give him a lift!

40:33.994 --> 40:36.399
You ain't gonna shoot me. He's bluffing.

40:37.365 --> 40:41.573
No, l won't. But l'm sure Willie here
will take great satisfaction in it.

40:45.674 --> 40:47.944
-Willie, you a baseball fan?
-Yes, sir.

40:48.009 --> 40:50.113
Who's the greatest ballplayer,
in your opinion?

40:50.179 --> 40:52.182
Willie Mays, no doubt about it.

40:52.314 --> 40:56.055
-That nigger couldn't hold my jockey strap.
-Excuse me, the man is speaking.

40:56.118 --> 40:59.457
And l'd say, the second-greatest player
is Jackie Robinson.

40:59.554 --> 41:02.795
-You know that's horseshit.
-Josh Gibson is the greatest catcher.

41:02.859 --> 41:05.297
-What about Mickey Cochrane?
-What about Campanella?

41:05.362 --> 41:10.171
You try to steal on Campy,
he'd run down there and tag your ass out.

41:10.433 --> 41:12.737
That's very poor firearm safety, Willie.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.073
Willie, who was the best base runner?

41:15.205 --> 41:19.480
Well, of course, the greatest base runner
of all time isn't riding in this car.

41:19.710 --> 41:20.745
No?

41:20.811 --> 41:24.852
The fastest base runner of all time
was ''Cool Papa'' Bell.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.551
''Cool Papa'' Bell, my ass.

41:26.617 --> 41:30.091
''Cool Papa'' Bell was so fast,
once he hit a line drive up the middle...

41:30.154 --> 41:33.193
that hit himself in the head
sliding into second base.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.631
Okay, best pitcher. Satchel Paige?

41:37.929 --> 41:40.634
Satchel Paige can throw a pork chop
past a wolf.

41:40.698 --> 41:43.404
Mr. Cobb, with that hesitation pitch...

41:43.468 --> 41:48.211
old Satchel would have had you
batting .220 and kissing his black ass.

41:48.473 --> 41:52.047
l didn't know you were prejudiced,
only talking about nigger ballplayers.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.683
Preiudiced? You calling me preiudiced?

41:54.847 --> 41:56.917
The man with the gun does the talking.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.985
You wretched old prick.

42:05.025 --> 42:06.527
Slow down, Mr. Cobb.

42:07.060 --> 42:08.061
Watch it.

42:11.264 --> 42:13.101
What the hell are you doing?

42:27.582 --> 42:29.117
That's it. l'm driving.

42:29.183 --> 42:32.189
Get your hands off
the goddamn steering wheel.

43:02.752 --> 43:04.555
Fucked up roads, Stumpy.

43:07.457 --> 43:08.859
Thank you, Lord.

43:10.193 --> 43:12.398
And l want to thank you, Mr. Cobb...

43:12.763 --> 43:14.532
for the lift into town.

43:15.733 --> 43:16.968
And you, sir...

43:17.468 --> 43:20.974
you should leave
this disgusting, wretched...

43:21.205 --> 43:24.845
sorry son of a motherfucker immediately.

43:25.911 --> 43:27.146
Good evening.

43:43.495 --> 43:45.699
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

43:46.432 --> 43:48.703
Oh, Lord, there's Reno, Nevada.

44:24.439 --> 44:26.141
What is the problem now?

44:26.941 --> 44:28.644
l'm a loyal customer....

44:29.043 --> 44:30.613
All you do is complain.

44:30.679 --> 44:33.952
Complain? Have you ever tried drying off
with one of your towels?

44:34.016 --> 44:35.051
You can see through them.

44:35.117 --> 44:37.689
You cannot see through them.
Plus, people steal them.

44:37.753 --> 44:39.088
l can't keep good ones in stock.

44:39.154 --> 44:41.258
They're thicker than your blankets.

44:41.323 --> 44:42.592
Two rooms, please.

44:42.658 --> 44:44.628
Get in line. l'm in the middle of something.

44:44.694 --> 44:48.168
The heat's on the blink.
The mattress is lumpy. l want a discount.

44:48.231 --> 44:51.337
-Mona, you always want a discount.
-Ramona.

44:52.035 --> 44:53.203
And the mattress is--

44:53.269 --> 44:57.076
Excuse me, l got a very sick man.
Can l get him checked in, please?

44:57.140 --> 45:00.012
We're all sick in the eyes of God,
but we still have manners.

45:00.076 --> 45:02.281
-l'm not through with you yet, Jane.
-Ramona--

45:02.346 --> 45:03.848
l'm moving down the street.

45:03.913 --> 45:07.454
As a matter of fact,
l'm moving to a higher-level establishment.

45:07.985 --> 45:09.687
May l help you?

45:11.421 --> 45:14.562
Two rooms, please.

45:21.466 --> 45:23.837
l was a fool for thínkíng Cobb's bríllíance...

45:23.902 --> 45:26.373
míght be what l needed
at thís moment of my lífe.

45:26.437 --> 45:28.643
Ty Cobb was the last thíng l needed.

45:28.974 --> 45:30.711
He was not mísunderstood.

45:30.809 --> 45:32.746
He was understood perfectly well.

45:32.811 --> 45:36.218
He hated blacks. He hated Jews.
He hated Catholícs.

45:36.282 --> 45:39.855
He hated everythíng except hímself
and hís own víew of the world.

46:11.786 --> 46:15.693
''Pathetic, paranoid, and lost in the past.''
What is this shit?

46:15.756 --> 46:17.961
Those are my notes.
You can't look at my notes.

46:18.026 --> 46:21.031
Your fucking notes is my goddamn life.
You're gonna betray me.

46:21.096 --> 46:22.364
l'm gonna tell the truth.

46:22.431 --> 46:24.334
-Whose truth?
-Mine. l'm the writer.

46:24.399 --> 46:28.508
And l am the legend,
and legends are not fucking pathetic.

46:29.404 --> 46:31.242
They're iust notes.

46:31.307 --> 46:33.611
You don't know a thing
about greatness, do you?

46:33.675 --> 46:34.677
So sue me.

46:34.744 --> 46:37.616
Why don't you find yourself another writer?

46:39.482 --> 46:40.851
There's no time.

46:43.119 --> 46:45.324
Okay, l'm entitled to my opinion.

46:45.588 --> 46:47.325
That is truly pathetic.

46:47.490 --> 46:50.662
Who gives a good goddamn
about the opinions of Al Stump?

46:50.728 --> 46:54.234
What people want to know about
is Tyrus Raymond Cobb...

46:54.331 --> 46:57.070
not who he hates,
'cause everyone hates somebody.

46:57.134 --> 47:00.774
They don't care if he had two wives or 10,
if he hit women or they hit him.

47:00.838 --> 47:03.677
You think they want to know
how to steal second base?

47:03.741 --> 47:05.044
Yes, precisely!

47:05.343 --> 47:06.445
l don't.

47:06.510 --> 47:09.917
l get it. You're one of these
college psychology-type fellows.

47:09.981 --> 47:13.655
You want to find the missing piece
of the puzzle known as the Madman Cobb.

47:13.718 --> 47:16.723
You think you'll be
the next Ernest Hemingway?

47:16.788 --> 47:19.995
You're just a moderate-sized success
in a moderate-sized pond.

47:20.058 --> 47:23.933
Fuck you, Cobb.
l am much more than a moderate success.

47:24.229 --> 47:27.636
You sure have a little spirit there.
l like that. That's good.

47:29.067 --> 47:31.238
You want some goddamn psychology, son?

47:31.303 --> 47:32.839
l'm all ears.

47:33.239 --> 47:34.608
You listen to me.

47:35.208 --> 47:37.145
l'll give you some psychology.

47:42.615 --> 47:44.518
My father was a great man.

47:47.253 --> 47:51.595
He told my mother he was goíng out of town
for the weekend on busíness.

47:51.925 --> 47:53.495
But he dídn't go.

47:54.328 --> 47:58.669
He came back, because he thought
she was beíng unfaíthful.

48:00.067 --> 48:03.373
l don't know why he thought ít,
but he thought ít.

48:04.672 --> 48:09.248
My father thought he would catch the man
who was tryíng to steal hís wífe from hím.

48:09.944 --> 48:11.747
Catch hím ín the act.

48:14.716 --> 48:18.925
My father had hígh standards. The híghest.

48:19.321 --> 48:21.158
He belíeved ín qualíty.

48:21.323 --> 48:23.294
He belíeved ín educatíon.

48:23.459 --> 48:25.028
He belíeved ín God.

48:25.194 --> 48:26.663
He belíeved ín me.

48:27.196 --> 48:28.999
He belíeved ín my mother.

48:30.499 --> 48:32.704
But on that níght...

48:33.202 --> 48:35.272
he seemed líke a prowler.

48:36.038 --> 48:37.374
And so...

48:39.909 --> 48:42.781
my mother kílled my father.

48:43.180 --> 48:45.117
Shot hím ín the belly...

48:52.590 --> 48:56.531
and then blew hís head clean off.

49:02.166 --> 49:04.170
Your mother killed your father?

49:04.335 --> 49:07.507
Pretty goddamn good piece of psychology,
wouldn't you say?

49:07.571 --> 49:10.812
Childhood incident that explains me.

49:11.710 --> 49:13.413
Let me tell you something.

49:13.712 --> 49:17.352
l was a prick before it happened,
and a much bigger prick after it happened.

49:17.416 --> 49:20.255
You can stick that
up your Sigmund Freud ass.

49:20.419 --> 49:24.193
-Your mother killed your father?
-And you're not printing it, either.

49:24.290 --> 49:28.399
-l have to.
-No, not unless l say so.

49:28.528 --> 49:31.367
l don't think you understand something,
young man.

49:31.831 --> 49:35.505
-l have final editorial approval of your book.
-No, l do.

49:35.635 --> 49:37.238
l always have it.

49:37.304 --> 49:38.840
Did you read your contract?

49:38.906 --> 49:40.643
lt's my standard contract.

49:40.874 --> 49:43.579
l wouldn't have agreed
if l didn't have final approval.

49:43.644 --> 49:45.881
You better call your agent, boy, right now.

49:45.946 --> 49:48.851
Better call your lawyer.
Wouldn't hurt to call your mother.

49:48.916 --> 49:50.719
You're gonna need all three of them.

49:50.784 --> 49:52.787
Play another one of your games.

49:54.455 --> 49:57.460
You better call William and Morris.

50:04.599 --> 50:06.202
Long distance, please.

50:06.535 --> 50:09.073
Murray Hill, 65955.

50:12.975 --> 50:14.845
Sterling? Al.

50:14.910 --> 50:15.911
Sterling?

50:15.978 --> 50:18.450
No, it's going great. Couldn't be better.

50:19.715 --> 50:21.518
Look, quick question.

50:22.017 --> 50:25.824
We didn't give away final editorial approval
on the Cobb book, did we?

50:34.865 --> 50:37.403
Doesn't change anything?
What are you talking about?

50:37.468 --> 50:39.638
Everything's iust swell. Hunky-dory.

50:41.638 --> 50:43.274
Everything's iust fine.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.243
Speak to you later. Bye.

50:45.877 --> 50:49.350
You're pretty damn stupid
to give up editorial approval, aren't you?

50:50.247 --> 50:53.186
Predatory bastard.
Think you're going to pick over my bones...

50:53.250 --> 50:55.788
-you got another think coming.
-Fuck you, Cobb.

50:55.853 --> 50:58.391
Fuck me? How come you're so mad at me?

50:58.456 --> 51:01.195
Your publisher, your lawyer,
and your agent made the deal.

51:01.259 --> 51:04.833
You didn't read the contract
because you're a very trusting soul.

51:04.930 --> 51:07.602
Whoever heard of trusting
a lawyer or an agent?

51:07.666 --> 51:11.306
lf l was Al Stump, the man
l'd be pissed off at now would be Al Stump.

51:11.370 --> 51:13.474
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

51:14.039 --> 51:16.444
lf you die before this book is finished...

51:16.509 --> 51:18.112
l'll write the story l want.

51:18.177 --> 51:19.880
l won't die before it's finished.

51:19.946 --> 51:22.183
-l'll write slow.
-l'll die slow.

51:23.517 --> 51:26.255
Get your clothes on.
We're going to go get some pussy.

51:34.827 --> 51:37.533
for you're the lover l have waíted for

51:37.597 --> 51:41.237
You're the man that Fate had me created For

51:41.636 --> 51:45.243
And every tíme your líps meet míne

51:45.306 --> 51:49.447
Baby, down and down l go
Round and round l go

51:49.510 --> 51:51.647
ln a spín, lovíng the spín l'm ín

51:51.712 --> 51:53.817
Cigars? Cigarettes?

51:56.918 --> 51:59.890
Mr. Cobb, what a pleasure.

51:59.955 --> 52:01.992
l'll take that. Take their coats.

52:05.294 --> 52:08.533
ln a spín, lovíng the spín l'm ín

52:08.597 --> 52:09.866
Thank you.

52:09.932 --> 52:12.303
-Watch your step.
-Get your hand off me.

52:12.602 --> 52:16.409
l íust stay away, but what can l do

52:24.280 --> 52:27.286
-Guess they know you here.
-A little bit.

52:27.383 --> 52:30.523
Cigars, cigarettes!

52:31.622 --> 52:34.761
l'll bet you $100
l can get into her britches before dawn.

52:34.825 --> 52:38.766
My God, it's Mona. Ramona.
We met her at the hotel, remember?

52:38.862 --> 52:41.300
Young lady. Come on over here.

52:42.733 --> 52:44.470
Good evening, gentlemen.

52:45.269 --> 52:49.745
Cigars, maybe? We stockpiled Havanas
before Señor Castro did his little number.

52:49.807 --> 52:53.047
Sure. Couple of Montecristos, please.
Number Two, Ramona.

52:53.111 --> 52:56.451
-Have we met?
-Yes, at the hotel. Checking in.

52:56.748 --> 52:58.184
You were the asshole.

52:58.250 --> 53:00.120
Excuse me, young lady.

53:00.853 --> 53:04.894
l'll apologize for the manners of my friend.
He has a crude side.

53:05.157 --> 53:06.158
l accept.

53:06.526 --> 53:09.063
Ramona. That's a lovely name.
That's a Spanish name.

53:09.128 --> 53:12.568
That means ''moonlit garden of the gods,''
doesn't it?

53:13.967 --> 53:18.075
lt's German. It means ''wise protectress.''
But thanks for the thought.

53:18.271 --> 53:19.339
Thanks for the tip.

53:19.405 --> 53:22.244
Just a minute here.
l want to see all your cigars.

53:25.145 --> 53:27.350
Keely, got something for you.

53:28.549 --> 53:31.888
Thank you very much. We loves you, too.
You're a great crowd.

53:33.453 --> 53:36.259
l've been ínformed
that we have a celebríty wíth us toníght.

53:36.323 --> 53:37.358
A legend.

53:37.424 --> 53:39.762
A man who truly needs no íntroductíon.

53:39.827 --> 53:42.866
l'm gonna play a little trick on you, darling.
You watch this.

53:42.930 --> 53:45.034
The one and only Ty Cobb.

53:48.036 --> 53:49.171
Got you, didn't l?

53:49.237 --> 53:52.076
Didn't think you'd be in show business,
did you, darling?

53:52.140 --> 53:54.845
Come on here with me,
and we'll cut a rug up here!

53:54.910 --> 53:56.412
Sweet Georgía Brown.

53:57.012 --> 53:59.517
l don't think this is such a good idea.

54:01.883 --> 54:03.754
l can't waít tíll she kísses me

54:03.819 --> 54:06.124
Under the old green tree

54:07.090 --> 54:09.862
''Moonlit garden of the gods.''

54:10.860 --> 54:15.436
Sínce she came, ít's a shame
how she cools 'em down

54:15.498 --> 54:18.171
There are fellers she can't get

54:18.235 --> 54:20.572
There are fellers she aín't met yet

54:20.637 --> 54:22.942
Georgía named her, Georgía claímed her

54:23.006 --> 54:24.509
Sweet Georgía Brown

54:24.975 --> 54:26.510
Come on up here wíth Louís.

54:26.576 --> 54:28.981
Come on, right here, darling. Love you.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.082
They want you, Ty.

54:32.350 --> 54:34.587
Of course they want me.

54:41.726 --> 54:44.131
Sam, l see you over there now.

54:44.295 --> 54:45.598
How you doing, baby?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.538
How about this right here, baby?

54:51.603 --> 54:53.273
She can't get

54:53.339 --> 54:55.109
How about a little smooch?

54:56.541 --> 54:58.612
You're very sweet. That's great, darling.

55:00.847 --> 55:02.282
All right!

55:02.414 --> 55:04.050
Sweet Georgia Brown!

55:10.590 --> 55:12.627
Thís cat can really swíng.

55:14.094 --> 55:17.433
Help Louís welcome Mr. Ty Cobb.

55:21.635 --> 55:23.538
lt's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Cobb.

55:23.604 --> 55:27.078
l'm a bíg baseball fan,
so l always wanted to ask you a questíon.

55:27.308 --> 55:30.247
Wíth all the great players
playíng ball ríght now...

55:30.344 --> 55:33.316
how well do you thínk you'd do
agaínst today's pítchers?

55:33.381 --> 55:36.821
Agaínst today's pítchers,
l'd probably hít only. 290.

55:37.051 --> 55:38.487
That's amazíng...

55:38.553 --> 55:42.193
because you batted over .400
a whole bunch of tímes.

55:42.391 --> 55:44.261
Now tell us all, we'd líke to know...

55:44.326 --> 55:46.998
why do you thínk you'd only hít .290?

55:47.095 --> 55:50.703
l'm 72 fuckíng years old,
you ígnorant son of a bítch, that's why.

55:50.766 --> 55:52.569
Let me see thís thíng here.

55:52.635 --> 55:55.640
fírst of all, l want to say
thank you for Sweet Georgia Brown.

55:55.705 --> 55:58.377
A very fíne song about my home state,
and l apprecíate ít.

55:58.441 --> 56:02.348
That song has become the theme song
of the Harlem Globetrotters lately.

56:02.712 --> 56:06.319
lt's too bad such a fíne song had to be
taken over by a bunch of níggers...

56:06.382 --> 56:08.352
playíng a faggot's game ín theír underwear.

56:08.418 --> 56:12.493
That team ís owned by a Jew
named Sapersteín, so what do you expect?

56:12.556 --> 56:14.693
Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb.

56:14.758 --> 56:16.962
-Now let me explaín--
-Thank you very much.

56:17.026 --> 56:19.599
Let's have one more round of applause
for Mr. Ty Cobb.

56:19.663 --> 56:22.502
Gíve me the damn mícrophone,
you daggone bastard.

56:22.599 --> 56:24.569
Get this cracker off my stage.

56:25.269 --> 56:28.341
Let me explaín how to hít a baseball.
It's a lost art.

56:29.173 --> 56:32.513
Ever sínce that half-nígger Babe Ruth
started híttíng home runs...

56:32.577 --> 56:35.616
the skíll, art and scíence of ít
have been lost.

56:36.081 --> 56:37.750
Let's say, for example....

56:51.697 --> 56:54.102
-Tom Collins?
-Coming right up, Joanna.

57:11.785 --> 57:12.954
lt's you again.

57:13.020 --> 57:15.992
Hey, l didn't get your friend's name.
Who is that?

57:16.056 --> 57:17.993
That is Ty Cobb.

57:18.626 --> 57:21.063
The greatest baseball player of all time.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.967
Baseball, shmaseball
he should have been a da'ncer.

57:24.031 --> 57:26.836
Gotta tell you, the guy likes to lead.
So hard to follow.

57:26.901 --> 57:30.108
l haven't been spun around like that
for l don't know how long.

57:30.171 --> 57:31.506
You and me both.

57:35.376 --> 57:37.581
You are a beautiful woman.

57:38.179 --> 57:41.753
lt's the wig. Goddamn thing itches
but it's good for tips.

57:41.817 --> 57:43.988
Give me a little scratch, will you?

57:44.553 --> 57:45.822
Little faster.

57:46.823 --> 57:48.158
Very nice.

57:48.357 --> 57:50.995
Artie, another round. On him.

57:51.126 --> 57:53.264
Ramona, you're still on the clock.

57:53.430 --> 57:54.565
We have rules here.

57:54.630 --> 57:57.536
You can't sit next to your hair.
Sit under your hair.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.203
Gotta put your wig on.

57:59.336 --> 58:03.110
My follicles need to breathe,
and my shift is over.

58:05.108 --> 58:07.746
lt's crooked. Your wig's crooked.
It's tilted too much.

58:07.811 --> 58:11.050
-lf you pick it up over the eyebrow--
-Does it bother you?

58:11.147 --> 58:12.718
No, not at all.

58:13.517 --> 58:14.785
l like it.

58:15.586 --> 58:18.893
l suppose you want to take me to bed.
Is that right?

58:23.828 --> 58:25.197
You want money?

58:26.598 --> 58:29.236
l'm not a whore.
l don't know what you take me for.

58:29.301 --> 58:32.340
-That's one of the most insulting things--
-l'm sorry.

58:33.405 --> 58:35.408
l'm not very good at this. Let me start over.

58:35.474 --> 58:38.213
My name is Al Stump. l'm a writer.
l'm here on assignment.

58:38.276 --> 58:41.316
-Divorced?
-Not yet.

58:42.047 --> 58:43.717
What a stupid answer.

58:43.782 --> 58:45.953
-ls it that obvious?
-lt's written all over you.

58:46.018 --> 58:47.921
lf you want to pay me to screw, l won't.

58:47.987 --> 58:49.290
-Then l won't.
-Pay or screw?

58:49.355 --> 58:50.924
-Whatever.
-You don't wanna screw?

58:50.991 --> 58:52.526
-l do.
-All this ambiguity.

58:52.592 --> 58:54.329
l see why she's divorcing you.

58:54.394 --> 58:58.101
l don't know what l am doing.
l'm just trying to speak my heart.

58:59.132 --> 59:02.104
l asked my wife for a divorce.
She said, ''Okay.''

59:02.168 --> 59:03.804
Now l'm thinking, maybe l don't.

59:03.870 --> 59:05.640
-Then go back to her.
-No.

59:05.906 --> 59:07.542
Then quit crying.

59:08.075 --> 59:10.145
You want a divorce,
you don't want a divorce?

59:10.210 --> 59:14.352
You're asking marital advice from a woman
you're trying to get in the sack.

59:14.415 --> 59:17.388
l'm sorry. l gotta apologize.
l'm really not myself.

59:17.452 --> 59:18.654
Who is?

59:20.388 --> 59:23.360
This assignment has got me
totally befuddled.

59:23.525 --> 59:26.264
Am l to tell the world
that this monster is a prince?

59:26.327 --> 59:28.065
Am l iust supposed to lie?

59:28.130 --> 59:30.300
-You getting paid?
-Very well.

59:30.799 --> 59:32.836
Then it's not a lie. It's a iob.

59:33.101 --> 59:35.071
Quit agonizing. Take the money.

59:35.137 --> 59:37.976
-Do what you gotta do, and get it over with.
-l can't.

59:38.474 --> 59:40.077
-Then quit.
-l can't.

59:40.309 --> 59:43.816
-For God's sake, why not?
-Because he knows greatness.

59:46.382 --> 59:48.319
l wanna learn about greatness.

59:48.718 --> 59:50.488
Greatness is overrated.

59:54.724 --> 59:56.194
Maybe you're right.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:04.070
l'm sorry l bothered you.
l've been a little out of sorts.

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.505
See you around.

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:09.041
l'm an expert on out of sorts.

01:00:18.416 --> 01:00:21.088
Don't drink too much.

01:00:21.219 --> 01:00:24.124
You think l won't be able to screw
if l'm too drunk?

01:00:24.222 --> 01:00:26.660
Yeah, that crossed my mind.

01:00:28.694 --> 01:00:30.130
Screw....

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.010
Hey, l love this song.

01:00:49.815 --> 01:00:51.987
You are so thoughtful.

01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:56.626
The others are trying to get me drunk...

01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:59.060
and you're trying to keep me sober.

01:01:02.596 --> 01:01:04.700
You'd be good husband material.

01:01:08.302 --> 01:01:09.705
Let's dance.

01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:12.274
Honey, l was....

01:01:16.144 --> 01:01:17.647
Let's dance, Ginger.

01:01:18.046 --> 01:01:19.282
Ramona.

01:01:42.572 --> 01:01:45.010
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

01:02:00.825 --> 01:02:04.999
You two-timing bastard!
You goddamn Judas Iscariot!

01:02:05.062 --> 01:02:06.465
You're stealing my girl.

01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:08.534
Stop that. She's not your girl.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.371
Are you crazy?

01:02:11.836 --> 01:02:13.472
Mr. Stump, are you okay?

01:02:15.073 --> 01:02:17.510
You're coming with me, young lady.

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:20.213
Come on here, God damn it!

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.629
What's that?

01:02:36.229 --> 01:02:37.699
lt's my hair.

01:02:38.465 --> 01:02:39.767
Put it back on.

01:02:46.173 --> 01:02:47.441
That's better.

01:02:49.376 --> 01:02:51.046
Who are you again?

01:02:54.482 --> 01:02:56.351
l'm the Georgia Peach.

01:02:56.684 --> 01:03:00.023
And l have 4,191 base hits...

01:03:00.087 --> 01:03:03.260
in 1 1,429 at-bats...

01:03:03.324 --> 01:03:05.829
920 stolen bases...

01:03:05.894 --> 01:03:09.133
2,244 runs scored...

01:03:09.197 --> 01:03:11.234
and 93 batting records...

01:03:11.299 --> 01:03:14.271
and l want you take off
every stitch of your clothes.

01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:17.541
l don't think so.

01:03:24.513 --> 01:03:26.450
That don't scare me.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:32.492
'Cause if you kill me, l'll be dead,
and you're not gonna screw a dead lady.

01:03:34.557 --> 01:03:36.160
l might like it.

01:03:38.428 --> 01:03:40.733
Now you take off them goddamn clothes.

01:03:56.848 --> 01:03:58.483
You got big tits?

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:00.853
l like big tits.

01:04:02.019 --> 01:04:06.061
Actually they're not so big.
They're quite average.

01:04:06.491 --> 01:04:09.964
That's the way they stuff these outfits,
you know, they just...

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.432
build them.

01:04:12.832 --> 01:04:15.303
l owe a lot to these wigs and things.

01:04:16.034 --> 01:04:18.305
A girl's got to do what she's got to do,
you know.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:19.371
Shut up!

01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:22.142
You're shy.

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:25.512
Get on the bed.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.883
Get on that bed.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:37.159
My God, you're beautiful.

01:04:40.761 --> 01:04:41.762
Lay down.

01:04:45.266 --> 01:04:46.869
Roll over.

01:04:50.504 --> 01:04:53.343
What l could have done with you
in my prime.

01:04:53.407 --> 01:04:56.313
-l'm sure you could have, Mr. Cobb--
-Shut up!

01:04:56.911 --> 01:04:58.079
Turn around.

01:05:07.689 --> 01:05:10.762
l want you to do exactly
what l tell you to do.

01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:29.514
Exactly what l say.

01:05:31.848 --> 01:05:33.685
$1,ooo.

01:05:35.052 --> 01:05:37.256
-Just do what you gotta do.
-Shut up!

01:05:38.823 --> 01:05:41.460
You take this $1,OOO
and you tell everybody you meet...

01:05:41.525 --> 01:05:43.963
that you fucked the great Ty Cobb.

01:05:44.127 --> 01:05:47.935
And l was the greatest fuck
you've ever had in your life.

01:05:53.204 --> 01:05:54.573
That's all?

01:05:56.842 --> 01:06:00.749
-You want more? l'm a very wealthy man.
-No.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:05.220
-ls that what you want me to do?
-Yes, will you do it?

01:06:06.285 --> 01:06:07.620
Yeah!

01:06:13.993 --> 01:06:18.369
You are looking at a very beautiful woman,
you limber son of bitch!

01:06:26.039 --> 01:06:27.574
Dead down here.

01:06:28.842 --> 01:06:31.647
Damn thing has been like that
for two damn years!

01:06:31.712 --> 01:06:33.214
Nothing! Dead!

01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:41.391
Get the goddamn hell out of here.

01:06:52.734 --> 01:06:55.940
''Georgia Peach,'' my ass.
Georgia trash is what he is.

01:06:56.004 --> 01:06:57.407
Are you all right?

01:07:02.177 --> 01:07:05.049
That was the best piece of ass l ever had.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:07.752
God almighty, what a beautiful girl!

01:07:13.689 --> 01:07:17.229
Have we missed the testimonial dinner?
We got to get up and go.

01:07:17.293 --> 01:07:18.762
No, it's okay.

01:07:19.896 --> 01:07:21.331
Just lie down.

01:07:21.397 --> 01:07:23.802
We'll go to the testimonial dinner.

01:07:25.334 --> 01:07:27.105
Got to get up and go, Stump.

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:29.275
l wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:07:34.078 --> 01:07:35.981
That níght l made a decísíon.

01:07:37.281 --> 01:07:39.118
l decíded to tell the truth.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.264
l also made another decísíon.

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.200
l was gonna stay wíth hím
and fínísh the book...

01:07:54.265 --> 01:07:56.069
no matter where he took me.

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:05.847
l began workíng on two manuscrípts.

01:08:05.911 --> 01:08:08.516
One was hís yersíon, My Life in Baseball.

01:08:08.581 --> 01:08:09.749
How to steal second base...

01:08:09.816 --> 01:08:12.453
or how to hít the breakíng ball
to the opposíte fíeld.

01:08:12.518 --> 01:08:14.388
lt contaíned nothíng about hís parents.

01:08:14.453 --> 01:08:16.991
lt contaíned nothíng
about hís chíldren and ex-wíves...

01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:18.725
none of whom would even speak to hím.

01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:22.599
lt contaíned no ínsíghts from hís fríends
because l couldn't fínd any.

01:08:35.408 --> 01:08:37.981
lt was a baseball book.
l kept ít ín the typewríter...

01:08:38.045 --> 01:08:39.983
for hím to díscover and amend.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.853
lt was a book l never planned to publísh.

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:46.055
The second book, my book...

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:48.926
was wrítten on
Iegal pads and hotel statíonery...

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:51.761
and cocktaíl napkíns
and anythíng l could scrape together...

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.764
wíthout drawíng hís attentíon.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.304
Nothing like a cigarette girl...

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:04.209
and 30 hours of sleep
to invigorate a man, Stumpy.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.578
You look like shit.
What's the matter with you?

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.314
l've been writing.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.616
Let's see how we're doing here.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.291
Yes, now you're getting it!

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:23.029
lt's none of this Sigmund Freud bullshit,
it's baseball.

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:28.268
You understand.
People are no damn good, Stump.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.602
But you get it.

01:09:31.335 --> 01:09:32.837
And l can trust you.

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.854
That's the way it goes, Stumpy.

01:09:47.919 --> 01:09:50.291
They boo all your career
and when you're dying...

01:09:50.354 --> 01:09:52.524
put you on a pedestal.
That's being a legend.

01:09:52.591 --> 01:09:54.294
-That for the record?
-Sure as hell is.

01:09:54.359 --> 01:09:56.831
l'm gonna buy in here right now, right there!

01:09:56.896 --> 01:09:58.699
Place your bets, folks. New shooter.

01:09:58.764 --> 01:10:00.400
Money plays, give me some hot dice...

01:10:00.466 --> 01:10:03.138
for the hot hand, we're gonna have
a hot table any minute.

01:10:03.769 --> 01:10:05.672
Play's five. Mark it.

01:10:07.706 --> 01:10:09.077
Hi there, Magic Hands.

01:10:09.175 --> 01:10:10.410
Stumpy, what is that?

01:10:10.476 --> 01:10:14.150
Joey, two to pass, two to come,
two on four the hard way.

01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:17.453
l'll be a son of a bitch.

01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:18.853
Four!

01:10:18.952 --> 01:10:21.290
Very nice, thank you very much.

01:10:21.355 --> 01:10:23.793
lt's a five. It's a three and a two. Point's five.

01:10:23.858 --> 01:10:26.028
My girl go with that nigger?
l'll be goddamned.

01:10:26.093 --> 01:10:27.863
They're standing next to each other--

01:10:27.929 --> 01:10:29.197
Ramona, you with that nigger?

01:10:29.263 --> 01:10:32.135
Money placed on the five. Forget it.

01:10:32.199 --> 01:10:35.406
-That man is a monster.
-Yeah, l know.

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.340
Wait, is she with you?

01:10:37.772 --> 01:10:42.181
This is my man, Mr. Cobb, and he's all man.

01:10:42.444 --> 01:10:46.586
My girl with my nigger.
l'll be a goddamned son of a bitch.

01:10:46.649 --> 01:10:49.053
You better duck down now,
you son of a bitch!

01:10:49.117 --> 01:10:50.854
He's got a gun. Get down.

01:10:56.893 --> 01:10:58.930
You goddamn yellow-belly.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.037
Do you know who the hell l am?

01:11:15.545 --> 01:11:19.085
l told hím the testímoníal dínner
at the Hall of fame was approachíng...

01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:20.919
even though ít was stíll weeks away.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:24.124
But at least that news got hím away
wíthout gettíng us ín jaíl...

01:11:24.188 --> 01:11:25.991
or gettíng somebody kílled.

01:11:26.089 --> 01:11:27.793
And as we headed across country...

01:11:27.858 --> 01:11:32.400
Cobb, as usual, was oblívíous
to the chaos he left ín hís wake.

01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:35.703
And then this fat ass named Babe Ruth
came into the league...

01:11:35.767 --> 01:11:37.804
and near destroyed the game of baseball.

01:11:37.869 --> 01:11:40.641
We thought he'd eat
and screw his way out of the league...

01:11:40.706 --> 01:11:42.142
but he hung on for a few years.

01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:43.476
Hung on?

01:11:44.309 --> 01:11:45.946
Come on, Ty.

01:11:46.012 --> 01:11:49.251
The man was the greatest ballplayer,
next to you, of all time.

01:11:49.314 --> 01:11:51.218
l mean, he hit 714 home runs.

01:11:51.283 --> 01:11:54.890
Anybody can hit a home run.
Now, excuse me, l got work to do.

01:11:54.954 --> 01:11:56.289
Sorry, Ty.

01:11:56.489 --> 01:11:59.695
l didn't care that they loved, cheered,
and adored Babe Ruth...

01:11:59.759 --> 01:12:02.331
l did care that they
respected his ball playing.

01:12:02.395 --> 01:12:04.365
They built Yankee Stadium for him...

01:12:04.431 --> 01:12:07.103
with a 297-foot right field line.

01:12:07.167 --> 01:12:10.474
My sister, Florence,
could hit the ball 297 feet.

01:12:10.538 --> 01:12:13.944
Come on, aren't you gonna give Ruth
credit for anything?

01:12:16.109 --> 01:12:18.113
He ran okay for a fat man.

01:12:29.223 --> 01:12:33.064
You know something, Alimony,
l think you're the best friend l ever had.

01:12:33.428 --> 01:12:34.730
You're kidding!

01:12:34.796 --> 01:12:37.903
l swear on the Bible,
l feel l can trust you now.

01:12:41.036 --> 01:12:42.639
And he kept talkíng.

01:12:42.705 --> 01:12:44.909
The gospel accordíng to Ty Cobb.

01:12:44.974 --> 01:12:47.546
Baseball ís a red-blooded sport,
for red-blooded men.

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.449
lt's no pínk tea,
and mollycoddles had better stay out of ít.

01:12:50.513 --> 01:12:54.087
lt's a struggle for supremacy,
a survíval of the fíttest.

01:12:54.183 --> 01:12:57.423
l had to fíght all my lífe to survíve.
They were all agaínst me.

01:12:57.487 --> 01:13:00.727
But l beat the bastards
and left them ín the dítch.

01:13:00.924 --> 01:13:02.994
The problem wíth baseball today ís that...

01:13:03.059 --> 01:13:07.168
the players are ín ít for the money
rather than the love and fun of ít.

01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:09.134
At the age of 22...

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.272
l sunk some dough into a little beverage
outfit in Georgia...

01:13:12.336 --> 01:13:15.843
dash, turned into Coca-Cola. Period.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.945
At 24, l sunk some dough...

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:21.281
in a couple of automobile companies
in Detroit...

01:13:21.346 --> 01:13:25.387
dash, turned into General Motors. Period.

01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:28.889
The money piled up like...

01:13:29.755 --> 01:13:31.090
base hits...

01:13:34.126 --> 01:13:36.129
and it's still piling up.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.669
A ballplayer loses a step the older he gets...

01:13:40.732 --> 01:13:43.171
dash.... No, semicolon...

01:13:44.203 --> 01:13:46.273
a man of finance gains one.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.777
Period, double space, new paragraph.

01:13:48.842 --> 01:13:52.683
Chapter 7 will be called
''Me and Napoleon Lajoie.''

01:13:54.213 --> 01:13:56.985
-How you doing, Stump?
-Great, fine.

01:13:57.217 --> 01:13:59.154
-Semicolon is very good.
-Good.

01:14:04.257 --> 01:14:06.528
Duríng the day we worked on hís book...

01:14:06.594 --> 01:14:08.263
at níght l worked on míne.

01:14:08.328 --> 01:14:10.466
l was drínkíng líke a físh,
smokíng too much...

01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:14.405
and by wrítíng two versíons,
l was becomíng somethíng Cobb was not:

01:14:14.468 --> 01:14:16.039
l was becomíng a líar.

01:14:16.104 --> 01:14:17.406
Fabulous stuff.

01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:21.546
-Stumpy, just brilliant. You're a genius.
-Thank you, sir.

01:14:22.443 --> 01:14:24.681
Damn, l love reading about me.

01:14:26.181 --> 01:14:28.452
Hey, what the hell is that out there?

01:14:29.284 --> 01:14:32.457
l'm trying to work in here,
you noisy son of a bitch!

01:14:32.521 --> 01:14:35.627
l'd appreciate a little
goddamn peace and quiet.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.197
Try that on, you noisy sons of bitches!

01:14:40.262 --> 01:14:41.898
l'm paying good money to stay here...

01:14:41.964 --> 01:14:44.402
and these noisy people
are raising all kinds of hell.

01:14:44.467 --> 01:14:45.869
l can't get any work done.

01:14:45.935 --> 01:14:48.640
Stumpy, take care of this for me.

01:14:48.705 --> 01:14:51.744
-lt's okay, no problem.
-lt's not okay.

01:14:53.009 --> 01:14:55.614
lt's okay.
Thought it was a prowler, that's all.

01:14:56.379 --> 01:14:58.349
We're leaving. Nobody's hurt.

01:14:58.415 --> 01:15:00.051
Everything's fine.

01:15:07.258 --> 01:15:09.662
Soon, l knew more about hís drugs
than he díd.

01:15:09.727 --> 01:15:12.867
Whatever bízarre cocktaíls of morphíne,
or líthíum, or ínsulín...

01:15:12.931 --> 01:15:15.503
l helped ínject ínto hís bloodstream
full of bourbon...

01:15:15.567 --> 01:15:17.938
somehow they always revíved hím.

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:28.817
Somewhere along the way,
l'd gone from bíographer to stenographer...

01:15:28.881 --> 01:15:30.516
to chauffeur to nurse.

01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:32.987
l was the only thíng
keepíng the bastard alíve...

01:15:33.051 --> 01:15:34.855
and l kept hopíng he'd díe.

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:39.427
You know something, Stumpy?

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:43.834
With a friend like you, l could go on forever.

01:16:24.172 --> 01:16:26.277
You're gonna see some great athletes...

01:16:26.342 --> 01:16:29.881
great men, great warriors
at this Hall of Fame dinner, Stumpy.

01:16:29.945 --> 01:16:32.583
You ain't gonna see no modern,
pansy-ass bullshit.

01:16:32.648 --> 01:16:35.387
No, l've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

01:16:35.451 --> 01:16:38.724
You fucking liar.
You've been hoping l'd die first.

01:16:38.788 --> 01:16:41.627
-You've got me all wrong.
-l got you right.

01:16:42.326 --> 01:16:43.861
But it's all right...

01:16:44.193 --> 01:16:45.829
'cause l need your help.

01:16:49.499 --> 01:16:51.002
See who that is.

01:16:55.606 --> 01:16:58.010
-May l help you?
-Cobb here?

01:16:59.142 --> 01:17:02.015
-May l ask why?
-l'm Mickey Cochrane.

01:17:04.815 --> 01:17:05.883
Come on in.

01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:07.988
Ty, it's Mickey Cochrane.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.823
Where's your goddamn tuxedo?

01:17:10.889 --> 01:17:12.892
-l don't have one.
-l sent you money for it.

01:17:12.957 --> 01:17:15.596
-lt didn't arrive.
-Bullshit, you drank it up.

01:17:16.862 --> 01:17:19.801
Can't have you going to the Hall of Fame
Iooking like that.

01:17:19.865 --> 01:17:22.070
Things have been rough, Ty.

01:17:22.234 --> 01:17:24.338
Don't complain and don't explain.

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.408
Here, please go buy yourself a tuxedo.

01:17:30.076 --> 01:17:31.479
Stores are closed.

01:17:31.544 --> 01:17:35.551
How could you be so good behind the plate
and so bad everywhere else?

01:17:35.615 --> 01:17:37.285
You broke-dick old bastard.

01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:40.189
Do l have to do everything
in this goddamn league?

01:17:44.792 --> 01:17:45.960
Hello, operator.

01:17:46.026 --> 01:17:48.731
Who's got the best men's store
in Cooperstown, New York?

01:17:48.929 --> 01:17:52.336
l tell you what. Get him on the telephone
for me at his house.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.973
Hello, Jack, this is Ty Cobb. Yes, sir.

01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:59.475
l'll tell you what you can do.
You go down to your store...

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.247
open it up, you sell a tuxedo
to the great Mickey Cochrane.

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:07.552
And while you're at it,
get him a cummerbund, new shirt, bow tie...

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.987
set of studs, and a set of cufflinks...

01:18:10.051 --> 01:18:13.224
and a bottle of cologne
'cause the son of a bitch stinks.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:14.992
l don't know. He might have had one.

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.760
lt's a ioke.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.527
What's that?

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:20.731
Sure do thank you.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:30.742
Mickey, you gotta put forth a better effort.

01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:33.244
-Here.
-Thanks, Ty.

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:38.083
lt was a great pleasure meeting you.

01:18:39.683 --> 01:18:42.722
He's lost, Stump. Fastball to the head.

01:18:43.687 --> 01:18:45.290
That poor man is lost.

01:18:46.056 --> 01:18:47.426
You support him?

01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:49.695
And l have for years.

01:18:51.061 --> 01:18:52.899
lt's not gonna go in your book though.

01:18:52.964 --> 01:18:55.869
-But why not?
-Because it would embarrass him.

01:18:56.033 --> 01:18:58.638
l don't wanna take that cane tonight.

01:18:59.304 --> 01:19:00.839
You've got to have your cane.

01:19:00.905 --> 01:19:03.477
l don't have to have anything.
You'll help me out.

01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:06.546
ln case l wobble, something like that,
you put a hand here...

01:19:06.611 --> 01:19:09.550
you keep me upright, l'm gonna be all right.

01:19:10.482 --> 01:19:11.751
l'll be there.

01:19:16.889 --> 01:19:18.158
How do l look?

01:19:22.395 --> 01:19:25.134
Like the greatest ballplayer of all time.

01:19:29.802 --> 01:19:32.542
The great left-handed pítcher
from the New York Gíants...

01:19:32.605 --> 01:19:36.847
who struck out fíve men ín a row
ín the 1934 All-Star game:

01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:39.115
Carl Hubbell, ladíes and gentlemen.

01:19:39.346 --> 01:19:41.283
Welcome ''The Meal Tícket.''

01:19:42.582 --> 01:19:45.321
The great thírd baseman
from the Natíonal League:

01:19:45.385 --> 01:19:48.224
Harold Joseph ''Píe'' Traynor.

01:19:49.890 --> 01:19:51.360
Mr. Double X...

01:19:51.526 --> 01:19:54.031
the great star of the Phíladelphía Athletícs:

01:19:54.095 --> 01:19:55.630
Mr. Jímmíe foxx.

01:19:57.198 --> 01:19:59.836
Paul and Lloyd Waner.

01:20:00.134 --> 01:20:02.072
And, ladíes and gentlemen...

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:05.343
the híghest lífetíme battíng average
of all tíme...

01:20:05.441 --> 01:20:07.778
fírst man elected to the Hall of fame...

01:20:07.842 --> 01:20:10.415
retíred wíth over 90 battíng records...

01:20:10.479 --> 01:20:14.788
the one and only Georgía Peach, Ty Cobb.

01:20:23.359 --> 01:20:24.662
Mr. Cobb?

01:20:26.829 --> 01:20:29.100
-Stump.
-l got you.

01:20:33.103 --> 01:20:35.675
-Mr. Cobb, good to see you again.
-How do you do?

01:20:35.739 --> 01:20:37.709
One more shot, Mr. Cobb.

01:21:05.004 --> 01:21:06.841
Good to see you, Lloyd.

01:21:07.607 --> 01:21:10.178
Sam Crawford, Cobb, long time no see.

01:21:10.242 --> 01:21:12.580
Sam, it's good to see you.
You doing all right?

01:21:12.645 --> 01:21:14.014
l'm still alive.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.651
We're gonna have a hell of a party
this evening.

01:21:16.715 --> 01:21:18.319
Big parties, Peach.

01:21:19.619 --> 01:21:21.422
How you doing? You're looking good.

01:21:21.487 --> 01:21:23.959
Rogers, l look like hell, you know it.

01:21:24.423 --> 01:21:26.462
Stumpy, l want you to meet
Rogers Hornsby...

01:21:26.527 --> 01:21:29.031
next to me, the greatest hitter of all time.

01:21:29.095 --> 01:21:30.798
-How do you do?
-Next to me.

01:21:31.698 --> 01:21:33.068
We'll tear them up good.

01:21:33.134 --> 01:21:34.603
Nice to see you again.

01:21:34.668 --> 01:21:37.673
Let's get this son of a bitch on the road.

01:21:41.308 --> 01:21:43.613
-Nice to see you again, Ty.
-Good to see you.

01:21:43.678 --> 01:21:46.249
Welcome to Cooperstown,
Iadíes and gentlemen.

01:21:46.814 --> 01:21:50.955
We are here to acknowledge
the greatest ballplayers of all tíme.

01:21:51.919 --> 01:21:54.992
But the greatest of all ís wíth us toníght.

01:21:55.456 --> 01:21:58.897
Símply put, the best ballplayer ever:

01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:01.565
Tyrus Raymond Cobb.

01:22:13.209 --> 01:22:18.085
We've gathered from the archíves
some specíal fílm on Mr. Cobb.

01:22:18.748 --> 01:22:19.983
Líghts, please.

01:22:20.049 --> 01:22:23.021
Thís 1916 portraít shows us Ty Cobb...

01:22:23.087 --> 01:22:26.626
ín hís Detroít Tígers uníform.
The Georgía Peach.

01:22:26.857 --> 01:22:30.330
Note the smug expressíon
and the hauntíng set of eyes.

01:22:30.527 --> 01:22:35.169
These dísturbíng eyes can be seen
ín the earlíest photo ever taken of young Ty.

01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:38.605
Turn the clock back
to the begínníng of the century.

01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:42.209
At that tíme, professíonal baseball
was a casual game.

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.577
Ballplayers were often clowns...

01:22:44.642 --> 01:22:47.915
but young Ty Cobb would have none of that.

01:22:47.979 --> 01:22:50.416
He turned the game ínto war...

01:22:50.616 --> 01:22:54.290
and ín the process,
ínvented the modern game as we know ít.

01:22:54.986 --> 01:22:58.760
The aggressíve, attackíng game
was vírtually Cobb's ínventíon.

01:22:58.823 --> 01:23:01.997
Here, we see hím runníng over
a fírst sacker on a drag bunt...

01:23:02.061 --> 01:23:03.463
a play he perfected.

01:23:03.528 --> 01:23:06.201
That's him. He'd take on the whole team.

01:23:06.265 --> 01:23:09.037
Jimmie, that's the way we used to play ball.

01:23:09.535 --> 01:23:12.308
You don't find these children
playing ball like that today.

01:23:12.372 --> 01:23:15.411
Here, we see Cobb
wíth one of hís fíve chíldren.

01:23:15.475 --> 01:23:18.080
That's Shirley. You remember Shirley?

01:23:18.278 --> 01:23:20.615
She's a big girl now.

01:23:21.514 --> 01:23:25.589
l love that house, Stump.
Stump, we gotta go see that house.

01:23:25.919 --> 01:23:29.793
And here, he shows hís son
hís curíous hands-apart gríp.

01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:33.097
Though he was unable
to teach hís flamíng, competítíve heart.

01:23:33.227 --> 01:23:35.064
Here, the pítcher makes the místake....

01:23:35.129 --> 01:23:39.270
-Stumpy, what in the hell is that?
-Why? It's a great film.

01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:41.403
Look, there he goes, watch this!

01:23:41.703 --> 01:23:42.771
lt's great!

01:23:42.837 --> 01:23:45.174
...and 54 tímes ín hís whole career.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.379
No base runner has ever approached
these records.

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:50.981
-Stealing home there.
-Yeah, l saw that--

01:23:51.046 --> 01:23:53.417
The fírst celebríty athlete
ín Amerícan hístory.

01:23:53.482 --> 01:23:55.052
Movíe stars and presídents...

01:23:55.117 --> 01:23:58.156
-What the hell is that?
-There you are with your buddy, Babe.

01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:02.228
Here, Cobb poses wíth hís great archríval,
the legendary Babe Ruth.

01:24:02.358 --> 01:24:03.727
You and the Babe.

01:24:24.015 --> 01:24:27.488
However, Cobb's publíc posturíng
as a famíly man...

01:24:27.551 --> 01:24:29.622
was íust that, posturíng.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:34.195
Here, he díscovers that hís wífe has hídden
some of hís precíous líquor...

01:24:34.258 --> 01:24:36.529
and she pays the príce.

01:24:39.064 --> 01:24:42.103
The allegatíons of wífe-beatíng were legíon.

01:24:42.167 --> 01:24:45.039
Her attempts to dívorce Cobb were met
wíth more beatíngs...

01:24:45.103 --> 01:24:47.340
untíl, after years of brutal marríage...

01:24:47.405 --> 01:24:51.012
she was granted dívorce
due to extreme mental cruelty.

01:24:54.713 --> 01:24:56.917
Wíth Cobb's vast fortunes and ínfluence...

01:24:56.983 --> 01:25:01.191
he was able to keep thís prívate part
of hís brutal nature completely quíet...

01:25:01.254 --> 01:25:05.463
buíldíng, ínstead, a heroíc publíc ímage
as a fíerce warríor.

01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:13.201
Get your ass on up here,
you half-assed nigger!

01:25:13.267 --> 01:25:15.237
Get up here! Come on!

01:25:15.502 --> 01:25:19.443
ln a famous íncídent ín 1912,
Cobb attacked a heckler...

01:25:19.506 --> 01:25:21.677
who turned out to have no hands.

01:25:21.876 --> 01:25:24.715
He was bríefly suspended for the íncídent.

01:25:27.382 --> 01:25:30.121
ln a shockíng development ín 1926...

01:25:30.184 --> 01:25:33.224
Cobb and Trís Speaker
were accused of fíxíng games...

01:25:33.288 --> 01:25:35.325
by pítcher Dutch Leonard.

01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:37.827
ls that the fix?

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.567
Credence to these charges was gíven
by Cobb's notoríous fríendshíp...

01:25:42.631 --> 01:25:45.236
wíth numerous unsavory gamblers.

01:25:45.367 --> 01:25:48.673
And even though Judge Landís
curíously acquítted Cobb...

01:25:48.737 --> 01:25:51.476
questíons stíll remaíned about hís guílt.

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.980
Cobb later told fríends
that he had enough damagíng ínformatíon...

01:25:55.044 --> 01:25:57.382
on other players ínvolved ín fíxes...

01:25:57.447 --> 01:26:00.753
that Landís acquítted Cobb
ín order to keep hím quíet.

01:26:02.952 --> 01:26:06.459
Cobb and hís fríends were well known
for booze and sex partíes...

01:26:06.522 --> 01:26:08.526
they had ín the off-season.

01:26:08.591 --> 01:26:10.027
Partíes called ''smokers''...

01:26:10.093 --> 01:26:12.230
whích took place
ín varíous huntíng cabíns...

01:26:12.295 --> 01:26:13.598
they fílled wíth hookers...

01:26:13.664 --> 01:26:16.669
many of whom
were hís guests at the ballpark.

01:26:44.029 --> 01:26:46.434
And ín one
of the most dísturbíng íncídents...

01:26:46.499 --> 01:26:49.504
Cobb chased a man he saíd
had accosted hím...

01:26:49.568 --> 01:26:53.008
and pístol-whípped hím to death,
Ieavíng hím to díe ín an alley.

01:26:53.072 --> 01:26:55.410
Though Cobb bragged about thís
among fríends...

01:26:55.475 --> 01:26:58.047
the íncídent was hushed up and forgotten.

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.987
Stumpy, he tried to rob me.
He tried to take the money out of my pocket.

01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:06.522
What? It's just you
in your Philadelphia uniform.

01:27:09.856 --> 01:27:11.359
Playing for Mr. Mack now.

01:27:12.559 --> 01:27:15.899
Near the end of hís career,
Cobb joíned the Phíladelphía Athletícs...

01:27:15.963 --> 01:27:17.365
and at the age oF 41....

01:27:17.431 --> 01:27:19.201
What do you see now?

01:27:19.967 --> 01:27:22.505
You in your Philadelphia uniform.
You look good.

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:26.077
''lf a man can't hít better than that,
he ought to quít.''

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:29.547
Whether híttíng a home run,
as shown here...

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:32.249
See, he can hit home runs
with the best of them.

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:34.886
...to all fíelds or runníng the bases...

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.087
l hit them home runs if l had to.

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:41.961
Ty Cobb domínated the game
as no man ever had.

01:27:42.358 --> 01:27:46.867
Yes, ladíes and gentlemen,
what a ballplayer!

01:27:49.999 --> 01:27:52.938
Let's all stand up for the Peach.
You're the best.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.435
-You sure you're up for this?
-203, l used to hunt and fish...

01:28:20.498 --> 01:28:24.940
with Rogers Hornsby all over north Georgia,
Iower Alabama, everywhere he'd think of.

01:28:25.403 --> 01:28:27.508
l appreciate loyalty in a friend.

01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.747
-You sure you're up for this?
-l've never been readier in my life!

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.783
-Rogers!
-You ain't coming in here.

01:28:36.848 --> 01:28:39.687
-lt's me and Stump!
-You bastard, you ain't coming in.

01:28:39.752 --> 01:28:41.588
-Who's in there?
-Me, Mickey, some broads.

01:28:41.654 --> 01:28:43.624
Let me talk to Mickey. Let me see Mickey.

01:28:43.689 --> 01:28:46.962
How are you doing, Mick?
You look good in that tuxedo.

01:28:47.026 --> 01:28:50.500
l can't let you in. This is Rogers' party.
l'm just an invited guest.

01:28:50.563 --> 01:28:53.201
God damn it, let me in! Wait a minute!

01:28:54.334 --> 01:28:56.171
Open the goddamn door!

01:28:57.671 --> 01:29:00.910
Let me in. Open up the goddamn door!

01:29:00.974 --> 01:29:04.881
-lt's okay, let's just go back to the motel.
-To hell with you!

01:29:05.412 --> 01:29:09.287
l invented the goddamn game of baseball!
Open the door!

01:29:13.354 --> 01:29:15.291
You sons of bitches!

01:29:22.163 --> 01:29:25.203
You sons of bitches!
l fought for players' rights...

01:29:25.267 --> 01:29:28.539
when you motherfuckers were crawling
on your hands and knees...

01:29:28.603 --> 01:29:30.774
begging the master for a iob!

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:34.847
Begging master for breadcrumbs
and you can't hear me now!

01:29:37.513 --> 01:29:39.650
-Let's go home.
-Let me in there!

01:29:39.748 --> 01:29:42.121
A ballplayer can make big money...

01:29:42.185 --> 01:29:44.722
but you motherfuckers are too stupid!

01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:48.027
You're all too stupid!
Open the goddamn door!

01:29:51.562 --> 01:29:53.666
-You're okay?
-Take me back to the Hall!

01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:56.034
-You sure?
-You know where the Hall is?

01:29:56.132 --> 01:29:57.134
Sure.

01:29:59.803 --> 01:30:01.106
This way.

01:30:02.472 --> 01:30:05.478
-l appreciate your coming.
-For Mr. Cobb, no problem.

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:37.246
Stumpy, what did you see
on that film there tonight?

01:30:40.479 --> 01:30:43.919
-l saw Ty Cobb playing baseball.
-ls that all?

01:30:45.084 --> 01:30:46.085
ls that all?

01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:50.591
You were the best.

01:30:53.227 --> 01:30:55.497
Save the romance for the book.

01:30:57.632 --> 01:30:59.535
Carry me home to Georgia.

01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:24.595
The book, líke Cobb, was almost Fíníshed.

01:31:24.994 --> 01:31:27.198
But he was dyíng slower than l was wrítíng.

01:31:27.263 --> 01:31:31.605
And líke everythíng else, he víewed ít
as a competítíon he was not goíng to lose.

01:31:32.568 --> 01:31:35.308
To me, we weren't rídíng to Georgía
ín a límo...

01:31:35.705 --> 01:31:37.508
we were rídíng ín a hearse.

01:31:40.076 --> 01:31:43.416
''One of my first clear-cut memories
is of a buggy...

01:31:43.914 --> 01:31:48.623
''bumping along a red clay road between
Commerce and Carnesville, Georgia...

01:31:48.919 --> 01:31:52.125
''with my legs dangling over the tailgate.

01:31:52.222 --> 01:31:56.864
''l was busy winding yarn
around a small core ball.

01:31:57.394 --> 01:31:59.165
''lt was slow work.

01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:03.337
''And the new kid in town
who owned a hittable ball...

01:32:03.702 --> 01:32:07.910
''could overcome social obstacles faster
than the boy who didn't.''

01:32:10.309 --> 01:32:13.013
-That's damn good.
-l put that in there.

01:32:14.679 --> 01:32:16.182
Long time ago, Stumpy.

01:32:19.351 --> 01:32:23.092
-Anything you want me to change?
-No, l wouldn't change a word.

01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:27.362
lt's the greatest biography
ever written, Stump.

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.463
The greatest.

01:32:43.677 --> 01:32:47.251
James, pull over here to the right.
Look here, Stump.

01:32:47.881 --> 01:32:49.684
Right up there, James.

01:33:01.696 --> 01:33:05.603
We're here. The fucking sign needs paint.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:22.289
My little girl lives right down this way here.
James, go right down this street.

01:33:23.986 --> 01:33:25.957
Sure this was the street?

01:33:26.188 --> 01:33:28.459
Down there about a block, James.

01:33:33.195 --> 01:33:35.234
The houses all look alike.

01:33:37.401 --> 01:33:42.043
-When was the last time you saw her?
-About 15 years ago. She understands me.

01:33:43.206 --> 01:33:46.446
Right there. There it is, right there.

01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:49.382
No, wait. Damn it!

01:33:55.954 --> 01:33:57.156
Maybe she moved.

01:33:57.221 --> 01:34:00.261
No, she didn't move.
It's that one right there, James.

01:34:00.591 --> 01:34:04.165
Right there, number 150,
over here on the right.

01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:13.306
There's somebody in the window.

01:34:18.344 --> 01:34:19.512
ls that her?

01:34:30.090 --> 01:34:32.795
Maybe she didn't recognize you.
Just wait here.

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:25.115
You can go.

01:35:27.116 --> 01:35:30.457
-Well?
-No, it wasn't her. It's....

01:35:31.355 --> 01:35:32.790
Your daughter moved.

01:35:32.856 --> 01:35:34.492
She used to live there--

01:35:34.558 --> 01:35:37.563
You cocksucking liar.
My daughter don't want to see me...

01:35:37.627 --> 01:35:39.365
and you're lying about it.

01:35:40.364 --> 01:35:44.071
Of course l'm lying about it.
That's what l'm paid to do, isn't it?

01:35:44.435 --> 01:35:45.971
Lie about the great Ty Cobb?

01:35:46.037 --> 01:35:48.141
You didn't like the iob, why didn't you quit?

01:35:48.205 --> 01:35:49.908
Who else is going to take care of you?

01:35:49.974 --> 01:35:53.281
Don't give me the sob-sister routine. Jesus!

01:35:53.511 --> 01:35:57.652
l listen to your bullshit,
l interpret, l find words...

01:35:57.716 --> 01:36:02.357
l give shape, l give life to your bullshit,
and you give me nothing!

01:36:03.589 --> 01:36:04.924
Nothing...

01:36:05.524 --> 01:36:06.525
but grief!

01:36:11.464 --> 01:36:15.940
You have never been this close to greatness
in your short life.

01:36:16.936 --> 01:36:18.305
And you love it.

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.042
Stop the car.

01:36:22.108 --> 01:36:23.978
Stop the car! Now!

01:36:25.512 --> 01:36:27.148
Stop the car, James.

01:36:29.182 --> 01:36:32.155
Stumpy, you are acting
like a 6-year-old child.

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:34.355
l'll be a striped-ass ape.

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.191
Where are you going?

01:36:38.926 --> 01:36:40.562
Wait here, James.

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:46.471
-Get back in the car.
-Just go on without me.

01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:50.675
-Get back in the damn car--
-Go on without me, l don't need you.

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:54.479
l'd run you down if l was
10, 15, 20 years younger.

01:36:54.876 --> 01:36:57.514
-Come here.
-l wish you'd die.

01:36:57.579 --> 01:36:59.149
l will, Stumpy.

01:37:00.349 --> 01:37:02.820
-And go to hell.
-l'll do that, too.

01:37:03.285 --> 01:37:05.757
Look how convenient you've made it.

01:37:06.122 --> 01:37:09.696
Of course it was your daughter.
She doesn't want anything to do with you.

01:37:09.759 --> 01:37:13.466
-l forgive her.
-You forgive her? That's rich!

01:37:13.530 --> 01:37:17.471
We all ought to forgive more.
You ought to try it. You're too damn angry.

01:37:17.534 --> 01:37:21.541
ls it the divorce?
You gotta let all that go, Stump.

01:37:21.604 --> 01:37:23.474
l love her, l don't want a divorce!

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:26.680
Of course you do. You're so used
to accommodating other people...

01:37:26.743 --> 01:37:29.382
you don't know
what the hell you want anymore.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.283
l don't accommodate anybody.

01:37:33.084 --> 01:37:34.820
No, you sure don't.

01:37:36.187 --> 01:37:38.090
And you have no friends.

01:37:38.222 --> 01:37:41.729
Do you? Who the hell are they,
those drunken hacks you hang out with?

01:37:41.793 --> 01:37:44.097
They think they'll write
the great American novel...

01:37:44.162 --> 01:37:46.467
but all they're really gonna do
is piss and moan...

01:37:46.531 --> 01:37:49.603
and write lousy leads
about high school football games.

01:37:49.668 --> 01:37:52.373
What about that little brunette
in the courtyard?

01:37:52.437 --> 01:37:55.509
ls she your friend?
l understand she fucks everybody.

01:37:55.574 --> 01:37:57.946
She must be everybody's goddamn friend.

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.316
You're something.

01:38:05.451 --> 01:38:07.221
l'm glad we're here.

01:38:07.887 --> 01:38:10.225
l was gonna bring you here anyway.

01:38:11.858 --> 01:38:14.495
And which great Cobb of Georgia
would that be?

01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:17.766
Me. Come on, l'll show you something.

01:38:27.842 --> 01:38:31.749
When l die, my mother and father
will be brought here...

01:38:32.747 --> 01:38:34.450
and in time...

01:38:34.515 --> 01:38:36.987
my dear sister, Florence, will ioin us as well.

01:38:37.051 --> 01:38:39.189
The family will be together again.

01:38:40.355 --> 01:38:42.192
-Under one roof?
-Yeah.

01:38:43.324 --> 01:38:46.631
That's romantic. You want that in the book?

01:38:47.829 --> 01:38:50.267
l mean, that Ty Cobb
brings the family together...

01:38:50.331 --> 01:38:52.169
to enter the gates of heaven whole!

01:38:52.635 --> 01:38:55.941
They're all gonna be here.
Yourself, your sister...

01:38:56.004 --> 01:38:59.378
your grandfather who was killed
at the fields of Fredericksburg...

01:38:59.442 --> 01:39:00.811
your father, the great man...

01:39:00.877 --> 01:39:03.314
then your mother,
who happened to kill your father.

01:39:03.379 --> 01:39:06.753
-Then you've got your kids--
-My mother didn't kill my father.

01:39:08.585 --> 01:39:11.891
-What are you talking about?
-My father told my mother...

01:39:13.957 --> 01:39:16.162
he was leaving town for the weekend.

01:39:16.927 --> 01:39:21.135
But he came back to the edge of the woods,
where he tied up his horse...

01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:30.646
because my father thought
my mother was beíng unfaíthful to hím.

01:39:31.509 --> 01:39:35.383
He was goíng to catch my mother
wíth another man.

01:39:53.398 --> 01:39:57.373
She had been marríed 22 years
by the tíme she was 34...

01:39:58.037 --> 01:40:01.444
and that's how old she was
the níght he came back.

01:40:17.591 --> 01:40:22.300
And l stood by my mother when
she was tríed for murder a few months later.

01:40:24.398 --> 01:40:28.139
l saíd she was noble and true...

01:40:29.637 --> 01:40:32.075
and loved my father completely.

01:40:33.041 --> 01:40:36.113
The whole thíng was an accídent...

01:40:38.047 --> 01:40:42.622
and she was acquítted,
as she should have been...

01:40:43.451 --> 01:40:47.026
because my mother díd not kíll my father.

01:40:51.327 --> 01:40:53.831
My mother's lover...

01:40:54.063 --> 01:40:55.633
kílled my father.

01:41:26.231 --> 01:41:30.639
The last thing my father saw
was the face of the man fucking his wife.

01:41:31.736 --> 01:41:33.774
ls that what you wanted to know?

01:41:36.441 --> 01:41:39.380
The only other people
who know about it are dead.

01:41:39.645 --> 01:41:44.187
You ain't going to put that in the book,
because you're the only friend l have left.

01:41:44.817 --> 01:41:47.122
You're the only man l can trust.

01:41:59.899 --> 01:42:01.902
l don't want to be your friend.

01:42:02.436 --> 01:42:04.373
l don't feel sorry for you.

01:42:05.738 --> 01:42:08.679
Your mother's lover
blew your father's head off, l don't care.

01:42:08.742 --> 01:42:11.815
You were a prick before it happened,
a prick after it happened...

01:42:11.879 --> 01:42:14.250
you've been a prick ever since.

01:42:14.314 --> 01:42:18.156
-And you are a prick now.
-Public relations are overrated, Stumpy.

01:42:18.552 --> 01:42:19.821
What are you talking about?

01:42:19.887 --> 01:42:22.860
-You need a drink. Come on in here.
-Fuck your drink.

01:42:22.958 --> 01:42:24.660
You're too damn angry.

01:42:24.826 --> 01:42:26.763
You need to let all that go.

01:42:26.828 --> 01:42:29.733
l'm going to tell the world
the truth about you, Cobb.

01:42:29.798 --> 01:42:33.272
l'm going to tell them that you hate women,
hate Jews, hate niggers.

01:42:33.335 --> 01:42:35.272
Shouldn't use the word ''nigger.''

01:42:35.437 --> 01:42:37.274
lt's racist and demeaning.

01:42:37.639 --> 01:42:39.844
l don't hate women. l'm not good with them.

01:42:39.909 --> 01:42:43.181
That puts me in the same boat
with you and every other man l know.

01:42:43.245 --> 01:42:44.915
You treat people like dirt.

01:42:44.981 --> 01:42:48.755
The children of America need heroes.

01:42:49.752 --> 01:42:51.255
You know that.

01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:52.923
Here.

01:42:54.057 --> 01:42:55.192
Come on.

01:43:02.933 --> 01:43:04.201
Attaboy.

01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:08.707
All right, there we go.

01:43:10.007 --> 01:43:13.748
You sit right there for iust one minute.

01:43:23.021 --> 01:43:26.094
You're an educated man, Stumpy.
Tell me what you think.

01:43:27.526 --> 01:43:30.331
Either my father
was inadequate for my mother...

01:43:31.797 --> 01:43:35.804
not the man l thought he was,
not a great man, not even a good man...

01:43:37.437 --> 01:43:39.273
or else my mother was trash...

01:43:40.606 --> 01:43:42.176
a common whore.

01:43:43.509 --> 01:43:45.379
lt's that simple, isn't it?

01:43:49.315 --> 01:43:52.020
As a boy,
l stood in court next to that woman...

01:43:52.452 --> 01:43:54.990
because suddenly
l was the man of the house.

01:43:56.222 --> 01:44:00.397
And as l stood steadfastly at her side
and heard the jury say ''not guilty''...

01:44:00.461 --> 01:44:04.770
l knew that woman had been
with another man the night of that killing.

01:44:11.406 --> 01:44:15.045
A man must defend his mother at all times.

01:44:16.778 --> 01:44:18.481
lsn't that right, Al?

01:44:20.816 --> 01:44:23.620
-Am l a fool?
-No.

01:44:25.053 --> 01:44:27.525
A man must defend his mother at all times.

01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:29.192
That's what l thought.

01:44:39.035 --> 01:44:40.772
-Al Stump?
-ln here.

01:44:42.972 --> 01:44:45.644
-Are you Ty Cobb?
-You're goddamn right.

01:44:45.908 --> 01:44:47.379
Well, goddamn!

01:44:49.679 --> 01:44:51.249
Mr. Al Stump?

01:44:51.315 --> 01:44:53.085
Goddamn right.

01:44:53.250 --> 01:44:55.989
Man, l've been chasing you
all over the country.

01:44:56.687 --> 01:44:58.957
l'm here to serve you papers.

01:45:01.224 --> 01:45:04.265
-What kind of papers?
-lt's the divorce, Stumpy.

01:45:04.329 --> 01:45:07.568
-l know this routine.
-You're being sued for divorce, sir.

01:45:09.367 --> 01:45:11.537
Hold it. My wife and l are still talking.

01:45:11.602 --> 01:45:14.240
Yeah, and what she's saying is, ''Fuck you.''

01:45:17.509 --> 01:45:20.448
Fuck me. Fuck her.

01:45:24.316 --> 01:45:25.618
Fuck him.

01:45:25.784 --> 01:45:28.356
Wait a minute here, Stumpy.

01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:33.828
-Look out now.
-No sudden moves.

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:36.564
You ain't serving me no papers.

01:45:36.996 --> 01:45:38.866
l'm iust doing a iob.

01:45:39.632 --> 01:45:41.268
That's not a toy, Al.

01:45:46.472 --> 01:45:48.009
l love my wife.

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:51.146
We all loved our wives.
That's not the point, Stumpy.

01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:52.948
Sure, you'll find somebody else.

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:56.153
There's a million women out there.
Now give me that gun.

01:45:56.317 --> 01:45:59.022
l am not going to accommodate this man!

01:46:00.388 --> 01:46:03.160
You're all mixed up, Al.
You'd better let me have that.

01:46:03.257 --> 01:46:07.666
No, you are right. l've been accommodating
people my whole life and it stops here.

01:46:08.863 --> 01:46:11.067
You've killed a man. l'll kill a man.

01:46:11.132 --> 01:46:12.268
l'm begging you.

01:46:12.334 --> 01:46:15.473
l got a little baby girl at home,
please don't shoot me.

01:46:15.803 --> 01:46:18.109
Don't give me that sob-sister stuff.

01:46:18.573 --> 01:46:21.612
Al, you'd better let me have that pistol.

01:46:22.211 --> 01:46:23.881
No.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.217
Life's too short to be diplomatic.

01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:30.088
A man's friends don't care
what he says or does.

01:46:30.253 --> 01:46:31.922
You're my friend, Ty.

01:46:32.122 --> 01:46:33.824
-You're my friend.
-Al, no.

01:46:33.889 --> 01:46:36.127
-You're my friend, Ty.
-Al, no.

01:46:36.359 --> 01:46:39.198
Shit. You want a divorce?

01:46:39.262 --> 01:46:41.199
Here's your goddamn divorce.

01:46:48.372 --> 01:46:49.741
He's crazy.

01:46:53.244 --> 01:46:55.281
No wonder she's divorcing him.

01:46:55.345 --> 01:46:56.716
He's crazy!

01:46:57.314 --> 01:46:58.850
You're served, pal.

01:47:16.367 --> 01:47:19.575
-l almost killed a man.
-A little drunken excess.

01:47:19.938 --> 01:47:21.541
lt's already forgotten.

01:47:22.241 --> 01:47:23.810
l saw nothing.

01:47:24.610 --> 01:47:26.113
Nothing happened.

01:47:26.712 --> 01:47:28.315
Like hell it didn't.

01:47:28.748 --> 01:47:30.383
Al, listen to me.

01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:34.390
lf l were to write a biography
of the greatest sportswriter of our time....

01:47:34.454 --> 01:47:37.526
l speak now, of course,
of the great Al Stump...

01:47:38.192 --> 01:47:40.729
would l include
what happened here tonight?

01:47:40.794 --> 01:47:42.364
Attorneys are pigs.

01:47:42.429 --> 01:47:44.867
Divorce attorneys are lower than pigs.

01:47:44.932 --> 01:47:48.071
What happened tonight was private.
An intimacy.

01:47:48.468 --> 01:47:51.341
Your business. Our business.
Nobody else's.

01:47:51.405 --> 01:47:54.445
lt does not belong
in a book about greatness.

01:47:54.809 --> 01:47:56.913
Nobody's going to write my biography.

01:47:56.978 --> 01:48:00.651
And when that little brunette
in that courtyard brushed against you...

01:48:00.715 --> 01:48:03.454
l know what happened:
the warm summer breeze...

01:48:03.518 --> 01:48:07.158
the smell ofjasmine,
black hair against a white blouse.

01:48:08.490 --> 01:48:10.125
You came to life again.

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:12.896
Your dick got hard.

01:48:13.795 --> 01:48:17.269
You saw that girl naked the first time,
it was more than you could bear.

01:48:17.333 --> 01:48:18.903
That's all right, Al.

01:48:18.968 --> 01:48:21.540
That brunette ain't going in the book, either.

01:48:23.205 --> 01:48:24.474
And now the booze.

01:48:24.541 --> 01:48:26.544
Say Ty Cobb had a drinking problem.

01:48:26.609 --> 01:48:30.216
You can booze me under the table,
right now, no problem...

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.817
ain't nobody's goddamn business, either.

01:48:32.883 --> 01:48:36.724
-Okay. l get it--
-Ain't going in our book about greatness.

01:48:37.087 --> 01:48:39.257
Then lay down there and go to sleep.

01:48:39.322 --> 01:48:40.925
You look pathetic.

01:48:41.425 --> 01:48:43.729
Come on. Here. Lay down there.

01:48:44.061 --> 01:48:45.697
All right, here we go.

01:48:48.032 --> 01:48:51.505
-Well, she's not everybody's friend.
-Yes, sir.

01:48:55.273 --> 01:48:57.143
You're my friend, Ty.

01:49:04.449 --> 01:49:05.952
You're my friend.

01:51:28.635 --> 01:51:31.308
You don't have a point of view, Stumpy.

01:51:32.005 --> 01:51:33.975
You're not worth killing.

01:52:03.706 --> 01:52:04.774
No.

01:52:06.175 --> 01:52:07.444
This can't be.

01:52:08.877 --> 01:52:10.181
Absolutely not.

01:52:19.423 --> 01:52:20.424
Stumpy!

01:52:36.941 --> 01:52:39.646
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:52:39.710 --> 01:52:43.185
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

01:52:43.281 --> 01:52:45.184
Give us this day our daily bread.

01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:48.824
And forgive our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass....

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:55.795
Fuck it.

01:53:08.107 --> 01:53:11.012
This is what it feels like.

01:53:11.243 --> 01:53:14.250
This is what it looks like.

01:53:16.150 --> 01:53:17.619
This is what it is.

01:53:41.643 --> 01:53:44.715
Will you get the Emory Hospital
for me, please?

01:54:24.455 --> 01:54:25.456
Peach?

01:54:27.391 --> 01:54:29.261
Fuck. Where'd he fall?

01:54:40.639 --> 01:54:41.640
_y_

01:54:49.314 --> 01:54:53.356
Dear Alímony, you lyíng son of a bítch,
l'm checkíng myself ínto the hospítal.

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:56.291
l thínk the end ís near. Your pal, Ty.

01:55:11.505 --> 01:55:13.709
Excuse me, l'm here to see....

01:55:15.442 --> 01:55:17.512
You call this a hospital?

01:55:18.112 --> 01:55:19.748
Do you know who l am?

01:55:19.814 --> 01:55:22.318
-Him.
-Be careful. He's got a gun.

01:55:22.382 --> 01:55:24.153
Yeah, l know. Thanks.

01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:25.721
Please stay back.

01:55:26.954 --> 01:55:29.459
Sir, please. He doesn't want any visitors.
Sir!

01:55:30.891 --> 01:55:32.896
Hell, Stumpy, come on in here!

01:55:33.028 --> 01:55:36.434
You won't believe the shit
they call food here. You get any sleep?

01:55:38.266 --> 01:55:40.804
l had a hell of a read last night, young man.

01:55:40.869 --> 01:55:42.606
Sir, l need to take some more blood.

01:55:42.671 --> 01:55:45.008
Bring a bucket here.
l'll cough up a few pints.

01:55:45.073 --> 01:55:46.109
l have to do it this way.

01:55:46.175 --> 01:55:48.646
-You won't hurt me, will you?
-No, sir.

01:55:50.779 --> 01:55:54.687
Jameson, l understand Fisher Body
went to $7.25. Buy me 1 ,OOO shares.

01:55:54.751 --> 01:55:56.955
-You keep your eyes on the Studebaker.
-Yes, sir.

01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:58.656
There's a nice piece of ass here.

01:55:58.722 --> 01:56:00.992
You come back later
and climb up on the big fella?

01:56:01.057 --> 01:56:03.027
That's against regulations, sir.

01:56:03.092 --> 01:56:04.128
You read the book.

01:56:04.194 --> 01:56:06.665
God damn it, l thought l could trust you.

01:56:07.097 --> 01:56:09.468
l used to read people better than that.

01:56:09.834 --> 01:56:10.936
The book is the truth.

01:56:11.001 --> 01:56:14.107
Truth is a whore, just like you are,
and just like my mother was.

01:56:14.171 --> 01:56:15.874
A Mr. Barton is here to see you.

01:56:15.939 --> 01:56:18.278
He says he's the chairman
of the board of Coca Cola.

01:56:18.343 --> 01:56:20.914
Tell him to have a Pepsi. l don't have time.

01:56:22.547 --> 01:56:26.388
-l need to take your blood pressure.
-lt's high. What else do you want to know?

01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:27.821
l have to do it.

01:56:28.319 --> 01:56:29.622
Go right ahead.

01:56:30.655 --> 01:56:34.095
Mr. Cobb, we cannot allow you
to have a gun in here.

01:56:34.158 --> 01:56:36.564
Step over here and take it away from me.

01:56:38.564 --> 01:56:39.565
Come on.

01:56:46.171 --> 01:56:47.675
What do we think of Standard Oil?

01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:49.577
Oh, we like Standard Oil, sir.

01:56:49.909 --> 01:56:53.449
Keep your eyes on it. l want 500 shares
in that Cincinnati Milling, too.

01:56:53.979 --> 01:56:55.717
My first son was a doctor.

01:56:55.815 --> 01:56:58.620
A hacksaw artist,
about like this one right here.

01:56:58.684 --> 01:57:02.125
He died of a brain tumor at 40.
Hadn't spoken to me in 15 years.

01:57:02.188 --> 01:57:06.431
Why? 'Cause l'm a shitty parent.
Why don't you put that in your book?

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:08.429
Bad, ain't it?

01:57:09.563 --> 01:57:12.402
l guess l died a lot faster
than you could write.

01:57:14.735 --> 01:57:18.209
l don't know which version
l'm going to publish. l really don't.

01:57:18.272 --> 01:57:22.681
Damn it. There you go again.
Accommodating me when you don't have to.

01:57:22.744 --> 01:57:26.852
Turn around, you son of a bitch!
Get out of my goddamn hospital room!

01:57:26.915 --> 01:57:28.251
Right now!

01:57:29.051 --> 01:57:31.054
That's it. Out. Come on.

01:57:35.023 --> 01:57:36.627
You fooled me, Stumpy.

01:57:37.059 --> 01:57:40.699
l didn't think anybody could fool me,
but you got it done.

01:57:41.464 --> 01:57:43.099
l thought we were pals.

01:57:43.866 --> 01:57:46.037
l didn't know what l was getting into.

01:57:46.102 --> 01:57:48.239
Shit. Will you stop explaining yourself?

01:57:48.304 --> 01:57:51.343
Stand by your damn convictions.
You beat the great Ty Cobb.

01:57:51.407 --> 01:57:54.747
l respect that.
But if you're gonna print it, print it all.

01:57:54.811 --> 01:57:57.750
My second son weighed 300 pounds.

01:57:58.415 --> 01:58:01.086
Died in the arms of a whore
in Paso Robles, California.

01:58:01.152 --> 01:58:02.921
My other son, l lost all track of him.

01:58:02.987 --> 01:58:06.626
My two ex-wives won't speak to me.
You know my daughter won't speak to me.

01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:10.197
And Ty Cobb can't get it up anymore.
Print it all!

01:58:12.497 --> 01:58:14.199
ls there anything you'd like today?

01:58:14.264 --> 01:58:18.307
l want everything back that l took
from Bethlehem Steel and l want it all now.

01:58:18.370 --> 01:58:19.739
Right away, sir.

01:58:23.274 --> 01:58:24.811
lt's very confusing.

01:58:25.177 --> 01:58:28.416
lt's not confusing. It's simple. You won.

01:58:28.481 --> 01:58:30.451
You go ahead
and tell the whole wide world...

01:58:30.516 --> 01:58:34.991
that the greatest ballplayer who ever lived
was also the greatest bastard.

01:58:35.053 --> 01:58:36.689
Who fucking cares?

01:58:38.357 --> 01:58:42.565
l give you my permission and my blessing!
From here on out it's your story!

01:58:57.878 --> 01:58:59.013
l almost forgot.

01:59:00.814 --> 01:59:03.152
l slipped them the old Oska-Fagus.

01:59:03.551 --> 01:59:05.053
Where's my money at?

01:59:05.118 --> 01:59:08.192
Your money's right here, Peach.
Next to your gun.

01:59:11.026 --> 01:59:13.730
The desire for glory is not a sin.

01:59:14.395 --> 01:59:16.332
Will you try to remember that?

01:59:18.132 --> 01:59:19.503
Get out of here.

01:59:30.179 --> 01:59:32.583
What about the gun? Did you get it?

01:59:32.915 --> 01:59:34.384
No, l didn't get the gun.

01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:35.451
Come on--

01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:46.299
l gave a few bucks to a local kíd
to repaínt the sígn...

01:59:46.362 --> 01:59:48.868
dísappeared for a whíle
to fínísh the manuscrípts...

01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:50.969
and to waít for Cobb to díe.

01:59:52.903 --> 01:59:55.875
And whíle I waíted,
Ernest Hemíngway blew hís braíns out...

01:59:55.939 --> 01:59:57.509
Getty bought Honolulu Oíl...

01:59:57.575 --> 01:59:59.145
Coke came out ín cans...

01:59:59.210 --> 02:00:02.783
and the brunette ín the courtyard
ran away wíth a young lawyer.

02:00:03.314 --> 02:00:05.518
And on July 17, 1961...

02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:08.555
Ty Cobb díed quíetly ín hís sleep.

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.959
l don't belíeve ít was quíet,
nothíng he ever díd was quíet...

02:00:12.023 --> 02:00:14.595
but that's what the newspaper wríter saíd...

02:00:14.659 --> 02:00:16.796
and we all know wríters never líe.

02:00:23.936 --> 02:00:26.340
To hell and back, can you believe that?

02:00:26.404 --> 02:00:30.313
Audie Murphy! You aren't going to compare
Audie Murphy....

02:00:35.815 --> 02:00:37.485
How are you doing?

02:00:39.185 --> 02:00:40.587
Good to see you.

02:00:41.054 --> 02:00:43.492
-How you doing?
-l'm doing fine.

02:00:43.557 --> 02:00:46.194
l've got to confess, l missed you guys.

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:50.067
Tell me, how's the novel coming?
Should be about finished, right?

02:00:50.131 --> 02:00:53.103
Actually, l haven't started it yet.
l've been kind of busy.

02:00:55.736 --> 02:00:58.541
So tell us. We want to know.
What was Cobb like?

02:00:58.606 --> 02:01:01.210
The stories, are they true?
Are they exaggerated?

02:01:01.275 --> 02:01:02.911
Was he a monster or a good guy?

02:01:02.977 --> 02:01:05.582
Tell us about Cobb.
What kind of a guy was he?

02:01:05.647 --> 02:01:06.749
The truth?

02:01:07.482 --> 02:01:08.952
What was Cobb like?

02:01:11.619 --> 02:01:12.955
You want the truth?

02:01:13.021 --> 02:01:15.291
Come on! Tell us.

02:01:15.523 --> 02:01:16.893
Don't hold out.

02:01:19.362 --> 02:01:20.831
The truth is...

02:01:26.569 --> 02:01:29.174
a prince and a great man has fallen.

02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:33.712
-Absolutely!
-All right!

02:01:33.776 --> 02:01:36.181
Tyrus Raymond Cobb!

02:01:38.481 --> 02:01:39.884
To Ty Cobb!

02:01:39.949 --> 02:01:42.989
A misunderstood genius,
as genius always is.

02:01:43.087 --> 02:01:44.222
Tell you a great story.

02:01:44.287 --> 02:01:45.824
Guy comes up to him and says:

02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:48.996
''Mr. Cobb, what would you hit
against today's pitchers?''

02:01:49.059 --> 02:01:51.329
Cobb looks at him and says, ''.290.''

02:01:52.530 --> 02:01:56.905
''.290? Your lifetime batting average is .367,
you hit over....''

02:01:56.967 --> 02:01:59.505
l publíshed the líe
and put the truth ín a closet.

02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:01.573
Cobb looks him straight in the eye
and goes:

02:02:01.639 --> 02:02:04.979
''Because l'm 72 fucking years old,
that's why.''

02:02:06.912 --> 02:02:10.986
Cobb left most of hís money to hís famíly,
whom he had largely destroyed.

02:02:11.049 --> 02:02:13.554
The remaínder was used
for an educatíon trust fund...

02:02:13.619 --> 02:02:17.093
for poor Georgía chíldren,
and to buíld a hospítal ín hís hometown.

02:02:20.459 --> 02:02:23.732
ln death, at last,
he was reuníted wíth hís parents.

02:02:24.631 --> 02:02:28.438
The man had some deep,
unexpressed sorrow l could never know.

02:02:28.768 --> 02:02:31.440
l embraced hím, and l hated hím.

02:02:32.605 --> 02:02:34.108
fínally l dídn't líe...

02:02:34.174 --> 02:02:37.513
so the Amerícan chíldren,
would have heroes or some such hogwash.

02:02:37.577 --> 02:02:39.615
fínally, l líed for myself.

02:02:40.213 --> 02:02:41.950
l needed hím to be a hero.

02:02:43.116 --> 02:02:44.519
lt ís my weakness.

02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:06.363
A ball bat ís a wondrous weapon.

02:07:06.429 --> 02:07:10.871
But you should never gríp ít at the end
íf you want balance and control.

02:07:11.034 --> 02:07:13.439
Learn the Fundamentals.

02:07:13.537 --> 02:07:15.807
The game ís a scíence.

02:07:16.606 --> 02:07:19.812
Battíng ís a mental actívíty,
a study ín psychology...

02:07:19.876 --> 02:07:22.916
an observatíon of líttle detaíls.

02:07:24.514 --> 02:07:26.952
Every great batter works on the theory...

02:07:27.017 --> 02:07:31.024
that the pítcher ís more afraíd of hím
than he ís of the pítcher.

02:07:31.689 --> 02:07:35.229
The batter owns the plate,
the pítcher must come to you.

02:07:37.228 --> 02:07:40.802
lf John McGraw were a young man,
l would have kílled hím.

02:07:43.134 --> 02:07:45.338
l regret l dídn't go to college.

02:07:45.404 --> 02:07:47.908
l feel l should have been a doctor.

02:08:13.233 --> 02:08:15.805
Baseball was 100% of my lífe.
