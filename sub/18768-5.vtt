00:16.520 --> 00:17.960
Everything all right, Chief?

00:18.040 --> 00:19.800
Well, it's just this final
section here, Dwayne.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.680
"Weaknesses and
areas for improvement."

00:22.760 --> 00:24.000
What about it?

00:24.080 --> 00:25.160
Well, it appears
you've left it blank.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.760
Mmm-hmm.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.920
Did you, uh,
forget to fill it in?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.200
No. I did try, Chief.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.240
I really racked my brains.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.720
But I just couldn't
think of anything.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.440
HUMPHREY: I see.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.480
Oh, well, then, I suppose
all we can do is take the fact

00:40.560 --> 00:42.520
that it seems
that you are entirely

00:42.600 --> 00:45.720
without fault,
erm, as a positive?

00:45.800 --> 00:46.880
I should say so, Chief.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.080
OK.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.000
Good!

00:51.080 --> 00:52.960
Well, thank you, Dwayne.
That concludes
your annual appraisal.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.720
Thank you, Chief.
Yes.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.520
JP, you're up
first thing tomorrow.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.560
Yes, sir.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.040
Why are we having to do
appraisals all of a sudden?

01:02.120 --> 01:04.080
Directive from
on high, Florence.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.000
The Commissioner's office,
no less.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.400
Now,
I'm sure he has good reason.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.200
Well,
I reckon that's it for today.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.360
We've all got homes to go to,
as they say.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.360
Night, sir.
Night, Florence.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.040
Night, sir.
JP.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.080
Night, Chief.
Dwayne.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.280
Oh, good evening, Humphrey.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.600
Evening, Catherine.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.280
Any chance of table for one?

01:36.360 --> 01:37.640
Oh, there's one over there.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.360
Thank you.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.920
I'll be ten minutes, no more.
Promise.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.640
How was the food?

02:34.720 --> 02:35.960
Delicious. Thank you.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.240
Oh, you and Martha.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.520
Um... (SIGHS)

02:40.600 --> 02:42.040
Yes.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.720
You miss her. Don't you?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.080
Quite a lot actually.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.280
You can't convince
her to come back?

02:51.360 --> 02:54.880
I think I sort of missed
my moment, Catherine.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.400
If you love someone,
you should tell them.

02:57.480 --> 03:01.360
Throw yourself at their feet
and declare it to the world.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.560
Beg if that's what it takes.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.520
That's very French
of you, Catherine.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.840
And so English of you, not to.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.200
Perhaps.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.040
(EXHALES)

03:15.000 --> 03:16.480
I've made my bed

03:16.560 --> 03:17.760
and I'll lie in it.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.000
Alone.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.640
Good night.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.880
Good night.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.760
Tom, please, I'm...

03:35.840 --> 03:38.600
I'm really worried about you.
I...

03:38.680 --> 03:40.720
Look, just call me when
you get this, OK?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.040
Is everything all right?
Sorry, erm...

03:43.120 --> 03:45.360
I heard you on your phone.
You sounded worried.
Are you OK?

03:45.440 --> 03:48.240
Well, it's...
It's my partner Tom.
He's...

03:48.320 --> 03:50.720
Well, he's supposed to be here
on our boat and...

03:50.800 --> 03:53.120
The boat's gone and he's not
answering his phone. So...

03:53.200 --> 03:55.360
Oh, OK. Look.
I'm a police officer, so...

03:55.440 --> 03:56.800
Let's try and get a hold
of the harbour master,

03:56.880 --> 03:58.360
see if he can
make contact, OK?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.880
There's been no response
from Mr Lewis all night,

04:21.960 --> 04:23.840
neither by phone nor radio.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.800
Now, the harbour master's got
a fix on the missing boat

04:25.880 --> 04:27.120
but we've been
waiting for the storm

04:27.200 --> 04:28.760
to pass to be able
to get out there.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.200
JP,
would you mind staying here
and waiting with Ms Boyd?

04:31.280 --> 04:32.400
Yes, sir.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.680
Let's go find
out what happened.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.080
Hello, HonorÃ© Police.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.640
Anyone on board?

Police!

04:59.320 --> 05:00.280
Sir.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:46.400 --> 05:48.160

05:48.240 --> 05:49.720
No sign of anyone below.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.640
Oh.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.200
He must have been
out in the storm
when the boom dropped,

05:55.280 --> 05:57.120
hit him on the head.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.120
Well,
he and his partner chartered
the boat out to tourists,

05:59.200 --> 06:00.880
so he's an experienced sailor.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.080
Then why would
he take a boat out
in such bad weather?

06:03.160 --> 06:05.520
Good question, Dwayne.
(GRUNTS)

06:08.280 --> 06:11.000
And his partner said he left
her at Catherine's Bar

06:11.080 --> 06:13.240
to secure the boat
in preparation for the storm.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.080
That was about 10:00.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.200
After an hour,
he hadn't returned
so she came to find him.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.240
(STRAINING)

06:20.080 --> 06:21.920
Both he and
the boat were gone.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.520
Something the matter, sir?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.640
Why is the blood
from his wound dry?

06:25.720 --> 06:28.040
Er, sorry,
Chief, I don't understand.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.600
Well, imagine it, Dwayne.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.920
Our victim is on deck,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.360
the weather's at its worst,

06:32.440 --> 06:34.760
the boom drops,
hits him on the head. Bang!

06:34.840 --> 06:36.760
His body lies here, lifeless,
for the rest of the night

06:36.840 --> 06:38.520
as the storm rages on.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.960
You'd expect the rain to wash
any blood away, wouldn't you?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.880
But look. It hasn't.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.480
See.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.800
So, you think he received
the injury somewhere else?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.680
Somewhere it was dry.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.240
And his body
was moved out here
after it had stopped raining

06:51.320 --> 06:52.760
to make it look
like an accident?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.400
Mmm-hmm.
So, he was murdered?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.360
I think he may
have been, Dwayne.
Yes.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.240
Then if that's the case,

06:59.320 --> 07:00.440
where did the killer go?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.560
Well,
they must have had access
to another boat

07:04.640 --> 07:06.720
and sailed off once
the deed was done.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.320
We could check the radar.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.960
It should have the boat's
movements from last night.

would you?

Yes, Chief.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.160
We're in luck, sir.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.280
The radar's been active
since yesterday morning.

Excellent.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.720
FLORENCE: What's that?

07:51.800 --> 07:55.120
Not sure.
Badge or a button.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.400

Maybe a tulip.

Hmm.

Sir?
Mmm-hmm?

This is the radar
log of the boat's
movements the last 24 hours.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.080
I've tracked through
from 10:00 last night...

08:10.160 --> 08:11.560
When he left Catherine's Bar.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.760
And it seems the boat
left harbour at 10:42,

08:14.840 --> 08:19.960
came straight out
to this position
and hasn't moved since.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.880
No other vessels are seen
in the vicinity of this one.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.320
No other boats came
near this one all night?

08:32.400 --> 08:33.360
Positive, sir.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.400
Chief, I checked all the rooms

08:36.480 --> 08:38.040
and everything
looks shipshape to me.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.920
Ah, yes. Thank you.
Thank you, Dwayne.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.760
So, if it was murder,

08:50.840 --> 08:52.800
how on earth did
the killer escape?

08:52.880 --> 08:53.920
Could they have swum back?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.840
I doubt it.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.960
We're five miles
out and the sea
was pretty rough last night.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.280

09:16.240 --> 09:17.200
Where's Tom?

Please.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.240
Contact the paramedics,
tell them we're
releasing the body.

Dwayne's on his way back

When he returns,
I want it searched
from top to bottom

09:32.920 --> 09:34.520
and everything
logged and photographed.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.120
Yes, sir.
When you've done that,

09:36.200 --> 09:38.440
I'd like you
going door-to-door,
or boat-to-boat rather.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.520
See if you can find anyone
who was present at the harbour

09:40.600 --> 09:42.160
at 10:42 when the boat left.

Here you are.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.480
I'm so sorry we
have to do this,

10:32.560 --> 10:34.640
I understand. I want to help.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.680
Thank you.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.800
So, just to be clear.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.480
You've all been out
with Mr Lewis and Ms Boyd

10:41.560 --> 10:43.000
on their boat
the last few days?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.720
Yes,
we chartered it for the week.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.280
Hema, Lucy and I,

10:46.360 --> 10:48.440
we're celebrating
our 40th birthdays.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.440
We thought we'd do
something special.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.480
You know,
leave the husband and kids
at home, celebrate in style.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.640
Sophie said that you think
that Tom was murdered.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.720
Is that right?

10:58.800 --> 11:00.440
Yes, we do, I'm sorry to say.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.240
Sophie.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.080
Can you think who
might have done this?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.200
Did Tom have any enemies?
Anyone he'd fallen out with?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.080
No.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.520
That's not what Tom was like.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.280
Yeah. Yeah, he was...

11:15.360 --> 11:17.440
He was just lovely.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.080
So, who did he know here
on Saint Marie?

11:20.960 --> 11:22.120
No one.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.200
No one at all?

11:30.280 --> 11:33.600
We're based on Antigua.
We hardly ever come here.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.920
It was us who asked to go
to Saint Marie.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.040
I see.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.000
So, the only people
Tom had contact with

11:40.080 --> 11:42.440
during his short
period on the island

11:42.520 --> 11:44.120
was the four of you?

11:44.200 --> 11:45.320
That's right.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.280
Could you talk me through
your movements last night?

11:51.360 --> 11:53.760
You were all at
Catherine's Bar?

11:53.840 --> 11:56.760
SOPHIE:
It was their
last night with us,

11:56.840 --> 11:58.440
so we all had
a drink together.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.080
Yeah,
we left around 8:00, I think.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.600
And then we all came back here
for the night.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.960
You didn't go out again?

12:04.040 --> 12:05.640
No,
we'd had a big day so we just

12:05.720 --> 12:07.240
headed straight
up to our rooms.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.720
Right. I don't
suppose there's someone

12:08.800 --> 12:10.160
who can vouch that
that was the case?

12:10.240 --> 12:12.960
Sorry, are you asking us
if we have alibis?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
Yes, I'm afraid I have to.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.920
We were all
alone in our rooms,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.640
I'm not sure how
we can prove that.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.240
So, how had things been
between you this last week?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.680
You all got on?

12:23.760 --> 12:25.560
It was their holiday,
of course we did.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.160
I'm sorry.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.280
You can't seriously think
that one of us killed Tom.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.040
We've only
known him five days.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.920
It's like the Inspector said.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.040
We have to ask the question.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.960
Well, then let me
answer it for you.
We all got on great.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.280
Tom was nothing
but friendly and charming.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.360
I can't think of
a single reason
why anyone, let alone us,

12:43.440 --> 12:44.480
would want to kill him.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.720
Yes.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.040
Just one last question.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.440
We found this on the boat,
below deck.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.800
I think it's
a button or something.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.160
Do any of you recognise it?

12:59.400 --> 13:00.720
No, I've never seen it before.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.160
No.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.200
OK.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.760
Well,
we'll leave it there for now.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.480
Oh, and, er...

13:18.680 --> 13:20.560
Should any of you remember
anything else, erm,

13:20.640 --> 13:22.400
anything at all,

13:22.480 --> 13:24.960
this is
the address of our station.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.520
Please.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.120
Do feel free to drop by.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.960
Lucy was very quiet.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.240
Yes, she was.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.840
Do you think she's
hiding something?

13:42.920 --> 13:45.120
I think she didn't want
to speak in
front of the others.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.320
Let's see if she comes
down to the station.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.240
(SPRAYING)

14:11.720 --> 14:14.280
JP: OK, thank you.
Thank you very much.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.760
Who are those people
you were talking to?

14:23.840 --> 14:25.520
Just some tourists
who chartered the boat

14:25.600 --> 14:27.400
to go fishing
with Mr Lewis this afternoon.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.520
Anything on your side?

14:29.600 --> 14:30.600
Come and take a look.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.360
Blood.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.000
(SIGHS)

14:47.000 --> 14:49.240
I think you're
right about Mr Lewis
being killed below deck

14:49.320 --> 14:50.760
and then brought up top,
you know, Chief.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.520
We found
significant traces of blood

14:52.600 --> 14:54.560
on the steps
leading up from the cabin.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.800
Yes. Whoever did it
must have cleaned up
after they moved the body.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.040
Or tried to.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.640
Excellent news.
Well done, Dwayne.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.000
I'm going to get the samples
we took over to the lab

15:01.080 --> 15:02.520
to see if they match
our victim's blood.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.160
And how did you get on
asking around the harbour?

15:04.240 --> 15:06.600
Anyone able to shed any light
on last night's events?

15:06.680 --> 15:08.800
Not really, sir.
But it was fairly quiet.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.760
A lot of the fishermen
are still out at sea.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.320
But I thought Dwayne
and I could go back

15:12.400 --> 15:13.800
first thing
tomorrow and speak to them

15:13.880 --> 15:15.120
before they head out
for the morning catch.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.640
Yes, good idea. Right.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.080
So, let's have a look
at what we've got so far.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.360
Our victim,
Tom Lewis, 50 years old,

15:21.440 --> 15:23.280
co-owner of
a boat charter business

15:23.360 --> 15:26.200
and by all accounts
a friendly and likeable man.

15:26.280 --> 15:29.840
And most importantly,
an infrequent
visitor to this fair isle.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.840
Which means,
as far as we're aware,

15:31.920 --> 15:33.920
that the only people
he knew on Saint Marie

15:34.000 --> 15:37.360
were these three women here
and his partner, Sophie Boyd.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.920
Originally from Cornwall,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.240
left school when she was 18.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.160
Appears to have spent
a lot of her life travelling.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.680
I checked with
the UK passport office

15:47.760 --> 15:49.520
and she's rarely
been back to England.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.800
Ms Boyd and Mr
Lewis started their boat

15:51.880 --> 15:54.040
charter business
seven years ago.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.960
And if Ms Boyd
is to be believed,

15:56.040 --> 15:58.800
she had a strong and
loving relationship
with Mr Lewis.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.960
Which is confirmed
by our three
possible suspects.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.960
Rachel Baldwin, Hema Patel,
Lucy Chapman.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.640
Now, they chartered
the boat for a week

16:06.720 --> 16:08.240
to visit some of
the smaller islands.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.800
Now, what have you got
on them, Florence?

16:09.880 --> 16:12.520
All from Redhill
in Surrey in the UK.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.720
All married. All have kids.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.120
And that's about it.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.000
But I'll keep digging.
Very good.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.720
So, the facts.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.280
Now, the victim was last seen
at 10:00 yesterday evening.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.920
Now, he claims that
he was going to go

16:24.000 --> 16:26.720
and secure his
boat in preparation
for the impending storm.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.880
However, we believe,
on returning to his boat

16:28.960 --> 16:31.160
he was murdered.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.640
The killer then sailed out
into said storm at 10:42

16:34.720 --> 16:36.720
and staged the scene
to make it look
like an accident.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.000
Until
the post-mortem comes back

16:38.080 --> 16:39.960
we can't be sure
of the exact time of death.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.240
Now, as Sophie Boyd

16:42.320 --> 16:44.680
was at Catherine's Bar
when Tom headed to his boat,

16:44.760 --> 16:47.200
and then here with
me at the station
for the rest of the night...

16:47.280 --> 16:50.040
Yeah. I'm trying to
locate the boat...

16:50.120 --> 16:54.240
We can, I think,
fairly rule her
out as a suspect.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.480
Which leaves our
three birthday girls.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.560
Now, they all claim
they were in
their hotel bedrooms

16:58.640 --> 16:59.920
when the victim was murdered.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.880
But as no one
can confirm this,

17:01.960 --> 17:04.480
that doesn't mean
that one of them
didn't return to the harbour

17:04.560 --> 17:07.000
to lie in wait
for Tom to arrive.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.480
Now, the only problem being

17:09.560 --> 17:11.600
if one of them
did kill Mr Lewis,

17:11.680 --> 17:12.960
take his boat
out into the storm,

17:13.040 --> 17:14.720
and stage it to
look like an accident,

17:14.800 --> 17:17.120
how the devil did they make it
the five miles back to shore?

17:19.280 --> 17:20.760
The answer,
I fear, will not be

17:20.840 --> 17:22.560
presenting
itself this evening.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.520
So as it's getting on, I...

17:24.600 --> 17:28.080
I think we
should call it a day,
go home, and sleep on it.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.920
Oh, er, sir, just to check.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.520
Are you still going
to appraise me today?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.480
Oh gosh, I totally forgot
about that, um...

17:34.560 --> 17:35.840
Sorry, JP.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.680
Uh...

17:37.760 --> 17:41.040
I think it's
best if we park it
until we solve the murder.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.160
You know what?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.600
I think
Catherine's got a beer with

17:43.680 --> 17:45.000
my name on it
waiting for me, you know.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.200
Anyone else?

17:46.280 --> 17:47.600
Yeah, just one quick one.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.080
Why not?

17:49.160 --> 17:51.400
Sir, drink at Catherine's Bar?

17:51.480 --> 17:52.640
Yes. That sounds, erm...

17:53.800 --> 17:56.160
Um, well, actually, I'm...

17:56.240 --> 17:58.680
I think maybe I should go
back to the shack tonight.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.880
Yes. Another time.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.000
(SIGHS)

18:38.400 --> 18:39.720
Right then.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.640
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

19:36.360 --> 19:38.400
Morning, Florence.
Morning, sir.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.680
Pleasant evening?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.040
Yes. Yes, it was, actually.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.600
Diner a deux at the shack.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.240
A deux?
Well,
me and Harry, as it goes.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.400
(CHUCKLES) You know,
it was good to catch up.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.880
It's, er... It's been a while.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.920
So, our post-mortem is in

19:50.000 --> 19:52.920
and confirms Tom Lewis died
from a severe
trauma to the head.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.280
Time of death
between 10:00 and 11:00.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.960
Which corresponds with him
leaving Catherine's Bar

19:58.040 --> 20:00.400
and his boat leaving harbour
40 minutes later.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.320
Yes. But more importantly,
the lab also confirms

20:03.400 --> 20:05.920
the blood Dwayne
found on the steps
leading down to the cabin

20:06.000 --> 20:07.360
does indeed
belong to our victim.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.320
So, you were right.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.480
He was killed in the hold
and his body moved
on deck later on.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.320
You look like
you've been busy.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.960
I'm afraid my evening
wasn't quite as
romantic as yours.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.800
I spent it going through
the victim's
financial records.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.200
I don't suppose
you came across

20:21.280 --> 20:22.960
any mention of
a City Met Bank.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.640
No. Why?

20:24.720 --> 20:27.240
Well, I started looking
on the Internet
for tulip logos

20:27.320 --> 20:30.520
to see if there was one
that could match this one.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.960
And I came across this.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.680
It's the same logo. City Met.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.520
Yes. It's a high
finance investment
bank based in London.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.040
They deal with hedge funds,
unit trusts,
that sort of thing.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.000
I'm pretty sure
there wasn't any mention of it

20:44.080 --> 20:46.280
in Mr Lewis'
financial records.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.280
Mr Lewis and Ms
Boyd shared a joint

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
account with
a small Caribbean bank.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.640
They seem to
have been struggling
the last few years,

20:52.720 --> 20:54.240
in and out of overdrafts.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.680
See if you can get hold
of our suspects'
records as well,

20:56.760 --> 20:58.760
it might have something
to do with them.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.800
Yes, sir.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.800
Sir?
Mmm-hmm.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.360
Hello.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.200
Mrs Chapman?

21:09.280 --> 21:11.200
I wanted to come
and talk to you,

21:11.280 --> 21:12.480
about Tom.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.200
So... (SIGHS)

21:18.280 --> 21:20.160
What do you want to tell us?

21:20.240 --> 21:23.360
I know everyone
was saying yesterday
what a great guy Tom was.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.880
(STAMMERS)
And I'm not
saying that he wasn't.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.080
He was charming
and friendly...

21:27.160 --> 21:28.960
But?

21:29.040 --> 21:31.240
There was something
going on with him.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.400
I'm sure of it.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.520
What do you mean?

21:33.600 --> 21:34.960
There were odd moments

21:35.040 --> 21:38.040
when I sensed that
Tom didn't want us around,

21:38.120 --> 21:39.840
didn't like us being there.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.880
OK.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.600
Erm...

21:44.720 --> 21:45.880
Anything else?

21:47.680 --> 21:49.080
Two days ago,
we were all going out

21:49.160 --> 21:51.120
for the evening,
Sophie as well.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.840
But Tom said that
he wanted to stay
and do some work on the boat.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.160
I realised that I'd left
my purse on the boat.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.880
So, I thought I'd pop back.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.400
I saw Tom below deck.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.280
He was counting money.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.360
There was a bag full of it.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.960
Cash.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.640
A lot of cash.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.160
Do you know what happened
to this bag of money?

22:12.240 --> 22:13.880
Only we, we never found it.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.720
No, I never saw it again.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.840
The other thing I
think you should know

22:19.920 --> 22:21.800
is that it's not
true that he didn't

22:21.880 --> 22:23.600
know anyone else
here on Saint Marie.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.120
Really?

22:27.840 --> 22:29.800
Our last day
with Tom and Sophie,

22:29.880 --> 22:31.560
we'd just pulled into harbour

22:31.640 --> 22:34.080
and I was in the galley
grabbing some fruit.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.160
Well, Tom was on deck,
on his phone.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.680
He didn't know I was there,

22:37.760 --> 22:40.720
and I heard him
arranging to meet someone.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.840
TOM: Yeah. Yeah.
Everything's set. Ready to go.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.200
I'll see you later on.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.360
Well, that's it.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.520
It's not much, I know.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.560
But he was
definitely up to something.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.400
We checked Tom's call register
on his mobile.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.720
He hadn't called
anyone for days.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.040
Second phone maybe?

23:00.120 --> 23:02.040
If so, we never found it.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.680
Whatever Tom was up to,

23:06.080 --> 23:08.280
do you think
Sophie was aware of it?

23:08.360 --> 23:10.560
No, I don't think so.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.040
It felt like whatever it was
he was up to,

23:13.120 --> 23:15.200
he didn't want
anyone else knowing.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.480
FLORENCE:
So, what do you think?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.160
HUMPHREY: I think there's more
to Tom Lewis than
we first believed.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.840
So, do we speak
to Sophie about it?

23:23.920 --> 23:25.920
It doesn't sound like
she knew what was going on.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.320
Could he really have kept
things secret from her?

23:28.400 --> 23:29.920
Well, she wouldn't
be the first person

23:30.000 --> 23:32.880
whose partner led
some sort of double life.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.520
FLORENCE: So, what do we do?

23:34.600 --> 23:36.240
Well,
what do we have, Florence?

23:36.320 --> 23:39.280
I mean, rather,
what don't we have? Erm...

23:39.360 --> 23:42.280
A bag of cash
that's gone missing

23:42.360 --> 23:44.520
and a possible second phone

23:45.800 --> 23:47.200
we never found.

23:48.560 --> 23:52.960
Oh, and we now also have
a new unknown suspect.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.280
The person Lucy heard
Tom arranging to meet

23:55.360 --> 23:56.800
the night he was killed.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.400
Exactly.
So,
who is our mystery suspect?

23:59.480 --> 24:01.840
Oh, we might be able to
help you with that, sir.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.080
What is it?

24:03.160 --> 24:04.800
We've been going
around the harbour

24:04.880 --> 24:06.400
trying to find any witnesses
from the night of the murder.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.000
And?
JP spoke to a fisherman

24:08.080 --> 24:10.200
who was repairing his nets
just before the storm hit.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.880
Around 20 past 10.
Yeah.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.120
JP:
He says that he saw Mr Lewis
on his boat.

24:15.200 --> 24:19.040
And then saw another man
climb aboard
a few minutes later.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.960
Now, it was dark so
he didn't see his face

24:21.040 --> 24:22.600
but he swears by it.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.880
He definitely saw a man
board Mr Lewis' boat.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.800
And then,
ten minutes or so after that,
the boat leaves the harbour.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.920
Which tallies
with the time we got

24:31.000 --> 24:32.960
from the boat's
radar log, 10:42.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.080
Yes.
It must be our killer, Chief.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.840
Yes.
It certainly would appear so.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.520
But if that is the case,
that would mean

24:39.600 --> 24:41.120
that none of these
three women here,

24:41.200 --> 24:43.680
who until now
have been our only suspects,

24:45.480 --> 24:48.720
murdered Tom Lewis.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.040
Which leaves us
asking the question,

24:52.160 --> 24:53.560
who the hell is this man?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.640
Sir, this might
explain what the little

24:55.720 --> 24:57.800
badge you found
was doing there.

24:57.880 --> 25:01.000
Maybe our mystery
man is connected
to City Met Bank in some way.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.520
I'm sorry. Did you just say,
"City Met Bank?"

25:03.600 --> 25:05.240
Why does it ring a bell?

25:05.320 --> 25:08.000
Yesterday at the harbour
I spoke to four men.

25:08.080 --> 25:11.760
They were
businessman here for the week,
entertaining a client.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.360
They briefly met with Mr Lewis
at Catherine's Bar
the night before.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.320
And they had made a booking
for him to take
them out fishing

25:21.400 --> 25:22.880
on his boat the next day.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.520
Mmm, they were staying
at the Rayon Vert Hotel.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.400
That's one of
their business cards.

25:28.480 --> 25:32.120
"Frank Henderson,
Head of Acquisitions,
City Met Bank."

25:32.200 --> 25:34.120
Er, but you said
this conversation
with Tom Lewis

25:34.200 --> 25:36.920
happened at Catherine's Bar.
They didn't
actually go on his boat.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.720
No. I mean, as I said,
it was
a two-minute conversation

25:39.800 --> 25:42.080
they had with Mr Lewis.
No more than that.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.200
That's why I
never mentioned it.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.520
Well, then how did this
end up on his boat?

25:49.160 --> 25:51.040
Let's get over to
the Rayon Vert Hotel.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.720
And, Florence, get Sophie Boyd
on the phone

25:52.800 --> 25:54.880
and see what she knows
about these four businessmen.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.160
(BELL DINGS)

26:13.120 --> 26:15.040
FLORENCE:
Sophie says Tom only met

26:15.120 --> 26:17.480
two of the four men
in Catherine's Bar that night.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.480
And she has no
idea what one of their

26:19.560 --> 26:21.400
company badges was
doing on Tom's boat.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.480
OK.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.800
Bit of a problem, Chief.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.400
This is the four
men's hotel, all right,

26:25.480 --> 26:26.920
but they all
checked out this morning.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.440
What?
They got the first flight

26:28.520 --> 26:30.160
back to London at 6:00 a.m.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.040
Well, did you manage to get
any of their details, or...

26:33.120 --> 26:35.200
Names, home addresses,
phone numbers.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.280
Good. Right, good.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.920
But that's not much use to us
if they're all in England.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.200
Is it, sir?

26:41.280 --> 26:42.360
No, Florence. No, it is not.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.080
HUMPHREY: I see.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.400
Yes, sir.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.960
No, no, no, of course, sir.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.600
No. It makes perfect sense.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.000
Yeah. Thank you, sir.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.920
Sir?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.840
The Commissioner says
we're to hand the case over

27:12.920 --> 27:14.280
to the Met Police in London.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.280
Do what?
Protocol.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.920
But it's our
murder inquiry, sir.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.600
Yes, I know, JP.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.160
But our suspects
are UK residents

27:21.240 --> 27:22.880
and they're now
back on UK soil,

27:22.960 --> 27:26.320
which I need hardly tell you
isn't within our jurisdiction.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.560
So, the police in London
will assign a case officer

27:28.640 --> 27:31.600
and we're to get
our physical
evidence over to them.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.000
You'd better
start scanning all

27:33.080 --> 27:34.280
your notes so we
can e-mail them over.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.440
Gee, man.

27:43.680 --> 27:44.680
(SIGHS)

28:11.400 --> 28:12.400
Inspector.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.480
Er, ah, Commissioner.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.520
Good morning.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.720
You sounded very
disappointed yesterday

28:18.800 --> 28:21.240
about your case
going to the Met.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.520
Well, yes, sir. Yes, I was.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.800
They're our suspects.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.640
Although,
of course, in fairness,

28:27.720 --> 28:29.360
we didn't know
they were suspects at the time

28:29.440 --> 28:31.040
or I wouldn't
have let them leave.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.160
Indeed.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.840
And after our phone call,

28:33.920 --> 28:35.760
I've been giving
it some thought.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.040
Oh?

28:37.120 --> 28:39.800
I think,
giving it due consideration,

28:39.880 --> 28:42.560
that simply
passing the case on

28:42.640 --> 28:45.200
reflects badly on
our police force,

28:45.280 --> 28:47.120
and on the island as a whole.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.640
As though we can't cope.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.960
Well, yes. There is that, sir.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.280
You will be pleased to hear
I've spoken to the governor

28:53.360 --> 28:55.640
who has spoken to
the Home Office.

28:57.000 --> 28:57.960
Yes?

28:59.680 --> 29:01.920
We can send a small team

29:02.000 --> 29:04.720
from Saint Marie to the UK
to work on the case

29:04.800 --> 29:07.640
in conjunction with
the Metropolitan Police.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.040
They've agreed for
you and your team
to question the suspects

29:11.120 --> 29:13.600
under the supervision
of one of their officers.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.240
Well done, sir.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.440
You are to liaise

29:17.520 --> 29:22.360
with a Detective
Inspector Jack Mooney
when you arrive.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.200
There's a flight
leaving for London

29:24.280 --> 29:26.480
Heathrow at 2:00
this afternoon.

29:26.560 --> 29:30.800
I have approved
the cost of you
and two other officers.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.640
I suggest you start packing.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.120
Yes, sir.
Yes, erm, and thank you.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.320
Show them how
it's done, Inspector.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.680
I'll do my very best, sir.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.480
(CLAPS HANDS)

30:35.160 --> 30:37.280
Oh,
and you'll take the luggage
to the hotel?

30:40.040 --> 30:42.080
Is it always this cold, Chief?

30:42.160 --> 30:44.640
This isn't cold, Dwayne.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.440
Is it good to be back, sir?

30:46.520 --> 30:47.800
You know what, Florence? Yes.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
What's that smell?

30:51.080 --> 30:54.000
Ah, yes. Drains.
You'll get used to it.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.480
Why is it so noisy?

30:55.560 --> 30:56.960
That'll be the traffic,
Dwayne.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.920
And the builders.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.680
Oh,
and the Overground as well.
Again, you'll get used to it.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.480
I don't think I will,
you know, Chief.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.760
Right, let's go see
where we're supposed to be.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.800
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.

31:09.880 --> 31:12.360
We've been assigned
a liaison officer...

31:12.440 --> 31:14.400
OK, I'll see if I
can get him for you.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.120
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

31:26.840 --> 31:27.800
Hello?

31:28.640 --> 31:29.600
Hmm.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.440
There's no one here.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.720
Well, this is the right room.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.120
Look, Chief.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.600
It's our crime scene.
Oh, yeah, so it is.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.440
And they've
clearly made a start.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.920
Yeah. And these are
the witness
statements we sent over.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.360
Where's everyone?

31:45.080 --> 31:46.400
There's the background checks
on our guys.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.800
Excellent.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.920
Frank Henderson,
Dominic Greene,
Steve Thomas.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.040
And Martin West.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.560
Jolly good!

31:53.640 --> 31:55.280
Now, we should really find
our Inspector Mooney,

31:55.360 --> 31:56.680
see what other
progress he's made.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.000
I've got his
number here somewhere.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.240
Yes. DI Jack Mooney.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.840
077...

32:01.920 --> 32:02.880
(CLEARS THROAT)

32:05.440 --> 32:06.480
I think I may have found him.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.080
Yeah?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.680
(INAUDIBLE)

32:13.000 --> 32:15.600
You need to turn
your volume up!

32:15.680 --> 32:16.720
We can't hear you!

32:17.920 --> 32:19.280
No comprende.

32:19.360 --> 32:21.160
I think you'll find
it's our volume, Dwayne.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.200
Er... Oh!

32:25.560 --> 32:27.360
Can you hear me now?
Yes! (LAUGHS)

32:27.440 --> 32:29.360
Uh, DI Mooney, I presume.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.360
You must be DI Goodman.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.120
Yes, I am indeed. And this is
Sergeant Cassell
and Officer Myers.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.960
Lovely to meet you all.
Welcome.

32:36.040 --> 32:39.320
Likewise. Only I was
perhaps expecting
you in the flesh.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.280
Oh, yes! Sorry, no.
I'm just down
the corridor in IT.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.440
Only you asked me
if we could set up
a video conferencing link,

32:45.520 --> 32:47.320
so you can talk
to your team in Saint Marie.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.680
Ah, yes, yes. I did, yes.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.280
Well, here it is.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.120
Obviously,
I'm not in the Caribbean.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.600
I would have taken
my jacket off for a start.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.680
No. I'm on my own, you see.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.800
So, to test it out, I had to
make a call and
answer it myself.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.800
Well, now that it's working,
maybe you should, erm...

33:02.880 --> 33:04.600
(CHUCKLING)

33:04.680 --> 33:06.360
Come in there!
Yes! (CHUCKLES)

33:06.440 --> 33:07.600
Excellent idea.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.360
(SIGHS)

33:09.440 --> 33:12.200
Oh! Hang on. Right.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.240
Sorry about that.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.040
It's this video
conferencing malarkey.
It's all new territory to me.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.840
My daughter's
been training me.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.560
But it's very much
early days, you know?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.120
DI Goodman.
Oh, Humphrey, please.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.600
Erm, and this is
Florence and Dwayne.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.120
Hello.
Hello. Jack.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.000
We were just starting to look
through the notes.

33:37.080 --> 33:40.480
Oh, yes!
Let me run you through it.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.760
You're wondering what an egg
has to do with your case.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.160
Yeah, and a torch.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.680
Nothing at all.
It's my daughter, you see?

33:46.760 --> 33:49.760
She makes me
a packed lunch every day,
darling girl that she is.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.040
And she happens
to know that I love

33:51.120 --> 33:52.240
a boiled egg with
a pinch of salt.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.880
Who doesn't?
Exactly, Humphrey!

33:53.960 --> 33:55.760
The problem is, though,
this past week

33:55.840 --> 33:58.440
she's been
incubating chicken eggs
in the airing cupboard.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.240
You know, for the little boy
who lives next door.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.520
He has chickens,
but no sense of
where they come from.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.920
So, well,
anyway, on Tuesday last,

34:04.000 --> 34:05.200
the long and
the short of it is,

34:05.280 --> 34:06.800
the egg in my lunchbox,

34:06.880 --> 34:09.960
it wasn't so much hard-boiled,
as alive and kicking.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.160
(CHUCKLES)
Like a tiny
velociraptor it was.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.960
(GROWLS)

34:15.040 --> 34:17.040
Yeah, with no chance
of the salt
making things better.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.520
Anyway, if you shine a torch
through the egg,

34:19.600 --> 34:20.800
you can see what's
going on in there.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.040
A very reasonable explanation,
Jack.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.920
JACK: Sorry,
I'm still a bit disorganised.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.320
We only got allocated
the incident
room this morning.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.760
And I've spent
a lot of time since
trying to organise a desk,

34:29.840 --> 34:33.000
and a phone and the video
conferencing thing,
as you know.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.840
So, where would
you like to start?

34:34.920 --> 34:36.600
Well,
I think first we should see
what our four suspects

34:36.680 --> 34:38.000
have to say for themselves.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.040
Right.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.720
WOMAN: Hi.
Good afternoon,

34:53.800 --> 34:55.840
we're here to see
Frank Henderson.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.040
OK, 15th floor,
just through there.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.160
Thank you.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.200
May I?
Of course!

35:16.560 --> 35:17.920
OK, JP.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.480
So, we've got Frank Henderson.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.880
Frank Henderson.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.360
Fifty-two years of age.
Head of Acquisitions.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.720
Been at City Met for 25 years.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.200
Single,
no kids, married to the job.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.320
Got it.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.680
Dominic Greene.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.920
Dominic Greene.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.120
Twenty-six.
This is his first job.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.760
He got
a double-first in Mathematics
from Imperial College,

35:38.840 --> 35:41.320
then went on to
Harvard to do an MBA.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.280
Steve Thomas!

35:43.360 --> 35:44.560
Steve Thomas.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.280
Also 26.

35:46.360 --> 35:49.040
Didn't do too well at school,
left at 16.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.760
Joined the bank a year later.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.280
And has never risen above
the level of team secretary.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.240
And finally,
we've got Martin West.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.040
Senior investment analyst.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.560
Only been here for four years.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.440
Worked in Hong
Kong before that.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.040
Came home after
he got married.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.800
Recently became a father.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.400
Well, Dwayne.
Sounds like you've been busy.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.480
I'm not here on holiday,
you know, JP?

36:11.560 --> 36:14.720
This is an international
investigation.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

36:16.320 --> 36:17.680
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

36:37.520 --> 36:39.280
Thank you for
seeing us so promptly.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.720
Didn't sound like
we had much choice.
What's this about?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.960
We were told it
was something to do

36:44.040 --> 36:46.120
with the boat
captain in Saint Marie?

36:46.200 --> 36:47.360
The one who died in a storm?

36:47.440 --> 36:48.600
Yes, that's right.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.200
But why do you
want to speak to us?

36:50.280 --> 36:53.480
(CHUCKLES) Erm, well...
May I?

36:55.920 --> 36:57.720
(CLEARS THROAT) The fact is

36:58.760 --> 37:01.360
this is now a murder inquiry,

37:01.440 --> 37:04.400
and we understand you saw
Tom Lewis the night he died.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.440
Yeah, he was
telling us about his boat.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.680
Ah! Out for a spot
of fishing, were you?

37:09.760 --> 37:10.920
Yes.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.880
Well, I can't say I blame you.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.640
I would have
done the same myself
if I was out in the Caribbean.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.680
It was me and Dominic
that were talking to him.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.840
It was what, a few minutes?

37:18.920 --> 37:21.600
Yeah.
I asked him if we could use
his boat the next day

37:21.680 --> 37:23.680
for a fishing trip
for a party of five.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.360
He said, "Yes,"

37:25.440 --> 37:27.960
and to meet him at the harbour
at 2:00 the following day.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.640
And did you see him again
after this conversation?

37:30.720 --> 37:32.360
No. No, we didn't.

37:35.160 --> 37:39.760
OK, uh, so where were you
from, say, 10:00 p.m. onwards?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.840
We'd a heavy one
the night before,

37:41.920 --> 37:44.680
so it was a quick night-cap
back at
the hotel and then bed.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.680
You said a party of five.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.480
We were closing
a deal with a client
who lives on Saint Marie.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.200
He was going to join us.
Name?

37:51.280 --> 37:52.840
Mike Wilson.

37:52.920 --> 37:56.080
We were negotiating terms
for a portfolio acquisition.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.160
We were there to
wine and dine him.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.720
Take him fishing.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.600
Kiss his backside
if that's what it took.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.200
(CHUCKLES)
And was it a successful trip?

38:04.280 --> 38:06.440
He flies in tomorrow
to sign the papers.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.880
Now, that doesn't
surprise me at all.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.520
You look like four
very persuasive fellas.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.040
You still haven't explained
why a five-minute chat

38:16.120 --> 38:19.520
with this guy
about hiring his boat
is such a big deal.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.280
It isn't.

38:22.640 --> 38:23.600
But this is.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.960
Do you recognise it?
It's your logo, I believe.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.840
It looks like
a badge or something.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.640
FRANK:
It's part of a cufflink.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.560
I had a set made for all of us
to commemorate the trip.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.160
(CHUCKLES) Cufflink? I see.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.120
And you, er...

38:43.200 --> 38:44.920
You all have a set of these?
Yes.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.320
How many pairs were made?
Just the four.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.080
Oh.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.200
Well, then you should know

38:55.280 --> 38:58.320
this was found on the boat
where Mr Lewis was murdered.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.760
My uncle used to
collect cufflinks.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.200
He must've had
about 100 pairs.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.920
I know on the surface,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.320
that may not
appear to be unusual,

39:22.400 --> 39:24.360
until I tell you
he only had the one arm.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.160
Yeah.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.760
He lost it.
I'll spare you the details.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.680
I'd love to see yours.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.320
Your cufflinks.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.120
Are you wearing them now?

39:40.160 --> 39:41.560
No.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.080
Mine's still at home.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.600
Still in the box, I think.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.120
No.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.320
Eh, it was just a thought.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.080
We'll pop back in tomorrow.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.120
So, if it's no trouble,
maybe you can
bring them in then.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.120
JACK: Well, that put the fox
amongst the chickens.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.680
HUMPHREY:
One of them is lying.
One of them was on that boat.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.160
And one of them, despite what
they're saying,
knew Tom Lewis.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.360
Exactly.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.840
Our officer
back in Saint Marie

40:11.920 --> 40:13.920
is speaking with
Mr Lewis' partner.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.880
Maybe she can help
us with that one.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.480
JP: OK. Look really carefully.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.160
Now, are these the four men
who spoke to your partner

40:23.240 --> 40:25.440
about hiring the boat
for a fishing trip?

40:25.520 --> 40:26.800
Yes.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.240
He spoke to these two.

40:32.040 --> 40:35.040
But it was just
for a few minutes.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.240
And have you ever seen them
before that night?

40:38.640 --> 40:39.600
No.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.640
Did you ever carry
any cash on the boat?

40:44.720 --> 40:46.520
No.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.440
Well,
just a few Eastern Caribbean
Dollars for provisions.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.920
But, not a large amount?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.520
No, of course not.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.080
All our bookings are made
in advance on credit card.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.120
Do you know if your partner
had a second mobile phone?

40:58.200 --> 41:00.680
I'm sorry.
Why are you asking
me these questions?

41:00.760 --> 41:02.120
Miss Boyd,
can you answer please?

41:02.200 --> 41:03.600
No, he didn't have
another bloody phone, OK?

41:03.680 --> 41:05.040
What's all this about?

41:06.800 --> 41:08.000
OK.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.600
Since we last spoke to you,

41:12.680 --> 41:14.320
we got some new information

41:14.400 --> 41:17.160
that your partner was seen
with a large amount of cash

41:17.240 --> 41:19.880
and making a call from
a phone we can't trace.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.480
Now,
would either of those things
mean anything to you?

41:22.560 --> 41:24.160
No, they wouldn't.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.840
(SIREN WAILING)

41:30.760 --> 41:32.120
OK, thank you, JP.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.600
(WHISTLING)

41:36.680 --> 41:39.560
Wow! Someone's been busy.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.080
It was very easy, once I found
everything I needed.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.880
But where did you
get all this stuff?

41:43.960 --> 41:45.720
I had trouble
getting a box of pens.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.280
Marjorie in
Logistics and Planning.

41:48.360 --> 41:49.960
Her grandfather's
from St. Lucia,
you know.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.200
Well, it's not what you know,
Dwayne, it's who you know.

41:52.280 --> 41:53.240
You know!

41:54.000 --> 41:55.120
Anything new?

41:55.200 --> 41:57.120
Well,
I just heard back from JP.

41:57.200 --> 42:01.320
Now, Sophie Boyd hadn't met
any of our guys
until that evening.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.240
She knows
nothing about the cash
or a second mobile phone.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.520
And does JP think
she's telling the truth?

42:06.600 --> 42:08.360
Well, he thinks so.

42:08.440 --> 42:09.680
He's gonna
start digging deeper
into the victim's history.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.040
See what that turns up.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.160
HUMPHREY: OK, good.
Then while he's doing that,

42:13.240 --> 42:14.680
we should approach it
from the other direction.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.240
See if we can find any links

42:16.320 --> 42:18.120
from our four bankers
back to the Caribbean.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.800
I'll get their phone
records up and take

42:19.880 --> 42:21.480
a look at their
e-mail correspondence.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.640
I'll start looking
into their finances.

42:23.720 --> 42:24.960
And get onto Immigration.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.160
Very good.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.800
You have a good
team here, Humphrey.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.280
Yes. Yes, I do.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
Commissioner?

42:43.920 --> 42:46.000
Carry on, Officer Hooper.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.400
Yes, sir.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.360
So, are you coping all right?

42:53.440 --> 42:55.320
Yes, sir.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.080
I'm just doing
further background checks
on the deceased, sir.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.800
And how is that going?

42:59.880 --> 43:02.640
Yes, er, fine, sir.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.360
I mean,
I've only just started.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.800
I know I need to
go further back,

43:05.880 --> 43:07.800
but I haven't worked out
a way to do it.

43:07.880 --> 43:11.640
Well, you may find it's easier
to work forwards than back.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.600
Start with his passport.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.040
Really?

43:15.120 --> 43:16.760
It will not only
give you the date,

43:16.840 --> 43:18.400
but also
the place of his birth.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.280
11th of May, 1967.

43:26.360 --> 43:27.480
In Chichester.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.600
Then you have
a starting point.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.440
School, first job,

43:31.520 --> 43:33.920
driver's licence,
voting register,

43:34.000 --> 43:35.680
first bank account.

43:35.760 --> 43:38.400
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

43:50.240 --> 43:54.040
I don't seem to
have had your appraisal
back from the inspector.

43:54.120 --> 43:56.360
Erm, no.
We haven't done it yet, sir.

43:56.440 --> 43:59.000
Then I suggest, perhaps,

43:59.080 --> 44:02.640
I watch how you cope
over the coming days.

44:02.720 --> 44:05.040
Do the appraisal
myself on what I see.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.320
How does that sound?

44:12.320 --> 44:14.160
(PRINTER WHIRRING)

44:29.800 --> 44:31.680
Right, everyone, erm...

44:31.760 --> 44:34.000
(SIGHS) There's not much more
we can do today.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.000
It's late,
we've all had a long flight,

44:36.080 --> 44:38.840
and I, for one, fancy a pint
at a good
old-fashioned British pub.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.200
Ha! A man after my
own heart, Humphrey!

44:41.280 --> 44:42.360
Florence? Dwayne?

44:42.440 --> 44:43.400
Of course.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.960
Er, not me I'm afraid, Chief.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.240
I promised I'd go and look
up my aunty, Lilibeth.

44:47.320 --> 44:49.280
Oh, you've family here?

44:49.360 --> 44:52.160
Yes, my aunty
Lilibeth and her husband
James came here in the 60s.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.640
I, of course,
was just a young boy.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.200
(CHUCKLES)

44:55.280 --> 44:57.200
OK, so...

44:58.160 --> 44:59.600

Hackney?

44:59.680 --> 45:01.120
Yes, Hackerney.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.240
Yes, I think you probably
need to get the Tube.

45:03.320 --> 45:04.360
Tube?

45:05.240 --> 45:06.920
I'll show you. Come on.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.160

45:24.920 --> 45:27.920

how long I've been
waiting for this.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.480
Thank you, Jack.

Cheers!
What is that?

45:41.120 --> 45:43.400
No! Can't abide the stuff.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.160

46:12.320 --> 46:14.520

46:14.600 --> 46:17.160
I was looking
for Lilibeth Myers.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.680
She's away.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.920
I'm looking after the house
until she gets back.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.680
I'm her brother, Nelson.

46:34.360 --> 46:37.640
Running back to
your mummy again,
eh, boy?

46:37.720 --> 46:41.240
Last time I saw you, you were
hiding behind
your mum's skirt.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.600
Wouldn't even give
your old man a hug.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.160
You were screaming at us.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.600
I was terrified.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.600
Now, you're all grown up.

46:56.680 --> 46:59.000
And a policeman.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.440
Listen, I didn't even know
you was living in London.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.000
I go where life takes me.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.160
Mmm.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.640
Just never back home.

47:07.560 --> 47:09.120
You judging me, boy?

47:09.200 --> 47:10.720
I'm not a boy
any more, old man.

47:10.800 --> 47:13.240
Look at you! All righteous.

47:13.320 --> 47:15.720
You don't know my story.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.360
And you don't know mine.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.960
You're right!

47:19.040 --> 47:20.760
When it comes
right down to it,

47:20.840 --> 47:23.960
there's nothing
to say, is there?

47:24.040 --> 47:26.080
I'll tell
Lilibeth you stopped by.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.880
Ah, it fell off.
But I had it replaced.
It's fine.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.320
He seems nice.
Yes.

47:42.400 --> 47:45.000
A little odd, though.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.160
Odd's not necessarily
a bad thing, Florence.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.040
Talking of which,
I wonder how Dwayne's

47:50.120 --> 47:51.840
getting along with
his family reunion.

47:51.920 --> 47:53.640

47:53.720 --> 47:55.080

48:02.200 --> 48:03.480
And?

48:03.560 --> 48:05.840
And so is Martha.

48:05.920 --> 48:09.680
Ah,
yes, it had crossed my mind.
Hard for it not to, really.

48:09.760 --> 48:12.480
So,
what do you think you'll do?
Go see her?

48:13.680 --> 48:14.960
Not quite sure, Florence.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.080
Still working
that one out, really.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.720
You know what I'm like
when it comes to
making a decision.

48:19.800 --> 48:21.280
Indecisive.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.320
Exactly.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.480
Good morning, Officer Hooper.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.880
Oh, good morning, sir.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.480

Ah, yes, sir.

48:40.560 --> 48:41.600
Good.

48:41.680 --> 48:42.640
Well, at least I think so.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.600
Go on.

48:46.680 --> 48:49.320
Erm, so I've been focusing on
the Chichester area,
just like you said.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.960
And birth, medical and
driving licence records

48:52.040 --> 48:55.280
weren't any use, you see.
The name Tom Lewis
is far too common.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.120
But then,
I decided to do a search

48:57.200 --> 48:58.920
on the Chichester
newspaper website

48:59.000 --> 49:00.280
for any Tom Lewis's there.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.200
And what did you find?

49:02.280 --> 49:06.080
An article
about a Mr Tom Lewis
winning a local sailing race.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.960
But how do we know
that this particular Tom Lewis

49:09.040 --> 49:10.320
is our Tom Lewis?

49:10.400 --> 49:11.960
OK, come and have a look.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.520
Please, sir.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.680
JP: Yeah.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.120
That's him.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.360
And that's interesting,
because?

49:25.440 --> 49:28.720
Because, look who was
in his crew for the race.

49:28.800 --> 49:31.800
One of our four suspects,
who denied knowing him.

49:31.880 --> 49:33.440
Frank Henderson.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.920
Sorry, drive on. Thank you.

Sorry, slept in a little.

Ah, but you managed
the tube all right?

into a space designed for ten?

close and personal.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.880
That's Tom Lewis,
about 20 years ago.

Jeepers. Isn't that...

50:59.760 --> 51:01.560
Yeah.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.440
That's exactly who it is.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.200
Tom was a friend.

51:16.200 --> 51:17.920
A trader here in the city.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.520
He worked for a rival bank
but he was very successful.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.120
We were both into sailing.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.440
And that's how
we got to know each other.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.080
You said you didn't know him.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.080
I know. That was a mistake.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.560
I thought it might
complicate things.

51:29.640 --> 51:32.120
Well, you're right
about that, Frank.

51:32.200 --> 51:33.640
I mean, what are we to think?

51:33.720 --> 51:35.600
It was a mistake.
An error of judgement.

51:35.680 --> 51:39.200
OK. Well,
let's not dwell on that.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.000
We all make mistakes.

51:41.080 --> 51:42.240
But can you answer me this?

51:42.320 --> 51:44.600
If Tom,
Mr Lewis, was such a huge

51:44.680 --> 51:47.000
success here in
the city of London,

51:47.080 --> 51:50.120
how did he end up
selling fishing
trips in the Caribbean?

51:50.200 --> 51:51.600
I don't know what you mean.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.040
Simple question, Frank.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.800
What happened to turn
his life upside-down?

51:55.880 --> 51:58.480
You know, this lot are
a tenacious bunch.

51:58.560 --> 52:00.040
They're sure to find out.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.440
All right,
I haven't got
anything to hide.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.560
Tom was a brilliant sailor.
He really was.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.560
But one day,

52:08.640 --> 52:11.280
he went out when
a storm was forecast,

52:11.360 --> 52:13.360
and he took his son.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.200
His eight-year-old son.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.680
And when the storm hit,

52:18.760 --> 52:21.200
it was much bigger
than he expected.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.920
And they were
both swept overboard.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.200
I mean,

52:29.280 --> 52:31.920
his son was swept overboard

52:32.000 --> 52:34.640
and Tom dived into
the sea to save him.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.520
But it was too late.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.120
The poor boy drowned.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.560
He fell apart.

52:42.640 --> 52:45.440
He blamed himself
for the kid's death.

52:45.520 --> 52:47.160
He started drinking,
getting violent.

52:47.240 --> 52:50.480
Within the year,
he'd been
sacked from his work.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.560
And then one day, he was gone.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.760
How do you mean, gone?

52:55.840 --> 52:57.440
He walked out of his life.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.680
According to his wife, he said
he was going out one day

52:59.760 --> 53:01.640
and he never came back.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.280
So, when did you discover that
he was,
in fact, on Saint Marie?

53:03.360 --> 53:04.560
Well, that's the thing.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.520
I haven't seen
Tom for two decades.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.200
And I didn't
even know he was on

53:09.280 --> 53:10.760
Saint Marie
when we were there.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.000
So, you're saying

53:14.080 --> 53:17.840
that although Mr Lewis
was a friend of
yours in the past,

53:17.920 --> 53:20.160
you want us to believe

53:20.240 --> 53:22.240
it was nothing more
than a coincidence

53:22.320 --> 53:24.880
that you happened to be on
the same island,

53:24.960 --> 53:27.480
and in the process
of hiring his boat,

53:27.560 --> 53:29.480
when he was brutally murdered?

53:31.720 --> 53:32.680
Yes.

53:58.680 --> 54:00.000
JACK:
So, you think he's your man?

54:00.080 --> 54:02.840
I think he's
the most likely option.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.000
And the chances are

54:05.080 --> 54:06.800
that piece of
cufflink belonged to him.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.560
But?

54:08.640 --> 54:11.560
But if he did kill Tom Lewis,
how did he get back to shore?

54:11.640 --> 54:14.040
I mean, if we could just
work out how he did it,

54:14.120 --> 54:15.880
then I'd say
we've got our man.

54:19.360 --> 54:20.320
Of course...

54:22.080 --> 54:24.200
Well, there is one explanation

54:24.280 --> 54:26.760
for how he got off the boat
and back to the shore.

54:26.840 --> 54:27.920
Which is?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.120
Maybe he didn't.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.920
What?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.560
Did you ever do cross-country
running at school?

54:32.640 --> 54:34.280
Yes. Yes, I did.

54:34.360 --> 54:36.920
Great! So, you know the way
you might run
the first half-mile,

54:37.000 --> 54:38.640
then maybe nip
off to a cafe for

54:38.720 --> 54:40.320
a bacon and egg
sandwich or whatever.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.200
Yeah.
Then get the number seven bus,

54:42.280 --> 54:45.080
muddy yourself up a bit,
then rejoin the lads,

54:45.160 --> 54:47.000
and run the last half-mile
back to school.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.960
You mean...

54:49.040 --> 54:51.640
When there is no possible way
for something
to have happened,

54:51.720 --> 54:53.920
it probably didn't.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.560
It's a bit like
when you lot first arrived.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.280
You didn't think I was here.
But I kinda was, wasn't I?

54:57.360 --> 54:58.640
You just hadn't seen me.

54:58.720 --> 54:59.880
You're right.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.640
Which of course
would explain how

55:01.720 --> 55:03.360
Frank Henderson
killed Tom Lewis,

55:03.440 --> 55:05.240
and then managed to make it
the five miles back to shore.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.480
Erm, Florence, call JP.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.520
Get him back to the boat,
tell him to search it again.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.640
Specifically, near where
we found the cufflink.

55:11.720 --> 55:12.720
What's he looking for?

55:12.800 --> 55:15.520
(SIGHS) Somewhere to hide.

55:20.880 --> 55:24.560

said the cufflink
was on the bed,

under the framed photo
of the victim and Sophie Boyd.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.080
OK.

55:34.160 --> 55:37.240
Why would Tom Lewis
have a hiding
space on his boat?

55:37.320 --> 55:39.880
The inspector
thinks that maybe
he was involved in smuggling.

55:39.960 --> 55:42.400
But he was
definitely up to something.

55:42.480 --> 55:46.040
And what with the bag of cash
that he was seen with,

55:46.120 --> 55:47.640
and the second mobile phone...

55:47.720 --> 55:48.960
Second phone, maybe?

55:49.040 --> 55:50.680
If so, we never found it.

55:53.320 --> 55:57.080
...it's very
possible it wasn't
just a boat-charter business

56:45.040 --> 56:46.400
Thank God you're here.

56:53.960 --> 56:55.200
He's dead.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.320
See, I know one of
you is the killer.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.040
It's just a question
of working out who.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.640
Whatever happened to Frank,
it had nothing to do with us.

57:07.720 --> 57:08.720
And that's where you're wrong.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.160
Officer Hooper?

57:10.240 --> 57:12.000
Commissioner!
I wasn't sleeping on the job.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.520
JACK:
Why has he not told us that?
That's very deceitful.

57:14.600 --> 57:15.800
You're not going anywhere
except to our cells.

57:15.880 --> 57:16.880
But I didn't do it!

57:16.960 --> 57:17.960
I don't need this.

57:18.040 --> 57:18.960
Well, I do.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.480
Hi, Dad!
Ah!

57:20.560 --> 57:21.920
Yes, that's
something of a puzzler.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.040
Inspector,
do you have your man?

57:24.120 --> 57:25.440
Hello, Martha.

57:26.640 --> 57:27.920
Humphrey?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.960
