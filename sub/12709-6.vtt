WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:03.570
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.604 --> 00:05.373
Spike, this is the Hellmouth.

00:05.405 --> 00:08.375
You have a soul?
Fine. Show me.

00:08.409 --> 00:11.579
-Get out of this basement.
-I don't have
anywhere else to go.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.846
There will always be
vengeance demons.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.550
But now you, Anya,
you're out.

00:16.583 --> 00:20.019
Whatever's between us,
it doesn't matter.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.821
You shouldn't be
alone in this.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.123
Yes, I should.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.097
You're gonna live in
the small room over there.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.030
I know it looks like a closet,
but it's a room now.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.033
You're not gonna touch my food,
I take the first shower
in the morning,

00:33.067 --> 00:35.936
and if I use up
all the hot water,
that's your tough noogies.

00:35.969 --> 00:39.673
And I hate this plan.
Are you keepin' up,
or do you need some kind of

00:39.707 --> 00:41.875
English to
constant-pain-in-my-ass
translation?

00:41.908 --> 00:45.612
Invitation?
Is there something more
emphatic than "hate"?

00:45.646 --> 00:48.216
Can I "revile" the plan?

00:48.249 --> 00:53.454
Fine. I invite you in,
nimrod.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.689
Don't want
your sodding food anyway.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.460
I just don't understand when his
problems became your problems--
more specifically, mine.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.131
The school basement
is making him crazy.
We can't just leave him there.

01:03.164 --> 01:08.236
Why not?
Crazy Basement Guy is better
than Stalking Buffy Guy.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.804
It's true.
You guys aren't--

01:10.837 --> 01:15.275
You're not starting up
again with the whole--
No. A thousand gallons of "no."

01:15.308 --> 01:19.746
It's just,
things are different now.
He has a soul.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.551
I'm sure that'll be a real
comfort when he soulfully
attacks you again.

01:23.584 --> 01:27.320
Yeah. What does that mean,
exactly, that Spike is
all soul-having?

01:27.355 --> 01:30.424
(sighs)
I don't know.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.593
But he's been through a lot,
okay? And nobody is attacking--
Buffy?

01:33.627 --> 01:36.664
(gasps)
Sorry.

01:36.697 --> 01:40.168
No, it's me. I just--
I'll go.
This can't work.

01:40.200 --> 01:46.140
It will. It already is, okay?
You know, you've been out of
the basement for half an hour,

01:46.174 --> 01:48.942
and you've already stopped
talking to invisible people.
Bollocks.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.645
Okay, so there was that
one episode in the car,
but--

01:51.679 --> 01:55.216
No. Bollocks to the whole thing.
I don't need your mollycoddling.
It's not coddling.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.019
Now go to your closet.

02:00.052 --> 02:02.256
(footsteps departing)
(sighs)

02:02.290 --> 02:05.325
DAWN: So, what is it?
BUFFY: What's what?

02:05.358 --> 02:08.360
DAWN: Last night,
you said you weren't
helping Spike out of pity.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.830
What is it?
It's a good
question.

02:13.667 --> 02:18.070
Is sitting there
drinking soda some kind
of a Zen non-answer?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.641
(sighs)
No. I just--

02:23.544 --> 02:26.447
I don't know
what I'm feeling. I--

02:26.479 --> 02:30.217
I think I can't stand him,
but then sometimes--

02:31.252 --> 02:33.820
You love him?
No.

02:33.853 --> 02:38.459
I--
I feel for him.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.995
Feel what,
exactly?
Dawn--

02:42.028 --> 02:45.332
No, um, I'm just trying
to understand.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.067
I mean, none of it
makes sense.

02:48.100 --> 02:52.506
First you say Spike disgusts
you, but secretly you two
are doing it like bunnies.

02:52.539 --> 02:57.043
And then Spike says
he'd die for you,
but he tries to rape you.

02:57.076 --> 02:59.212
(sighs)
For the record,

02:59.247 --> 03:02.650
Spike knew how wrong it was,
and that's why he went away.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.986
But to get a soul,
like that would
make him a better man?

03:07.020 --> 03:10.189
Xander had a soul
when he stood Anya up
at the altar.

03:10.223 --> 03:13.826
And now he says
he still wants her?

03:13.860 --> 03:18.532
I just don't think
it's the school basement
that's making people crazy.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.100
Oh, I should
really get back.
You coming with?

03:21.134 --> 03:23.704
I just don't see
why people bother.

03:23.736 --> 03:27.775
I mean, you put all this
energy into chasing and
having and brooding, and

03:27.807 --> 03:31.044
I just don't understand
these relationships where
you all do insane things.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.514
Bye, rant-girl.
Well, you could, like,
paint a beautiful mural

03:34.548 --> 03:36.750
on every ugly wall
in the world,

03:36.783 --> 03:40.320
and then you could paint
a beautiful mural
on every ugly mural in the wor--

03:41.655 --> 03:48.628
("Theme from A Summer Place" )

03:48.662 --> 03:51.564
(continues)

04:07.080 --> 04:09.081
(yelps)
(clatters)

04:10.850 --> 04:14.421
(theme music playing)

05:04.303 --> 05:05.805
(growling)

05:07.975 --> 05:10.644
Maybe I'm not even the right
Anyanka. Ever think about that?

05:10.677 --> 05:13.045
I mean,
tons of Anyankas out there.

05:13.079 --> 05:16.649
(blows landing)
Maybe one of them
pissed off this, uh--

05:16.684 --> 05:18.752
What did you say his name was?
D'Hoffryneffer?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.822
(groans)

05:24.591 --> 05:26.759
Good thing I stopped by
and heard screaming.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.701
So, I guess D'Hoffryn decided
to take you out after all?

05:33.733 --> 05:36.836
Yeah. He's, uh,

05:38.071 --> 05:40.340
not head of vengeance
for nothing.

05:42.442 --> 05:46.146
Well, thank you for
the generous life-saving.

05:46.178 --> 05:48.449
Now, please go away.

05:54.286 --> 05:56.122
Look, I don't need
anyone's help.

05:57.356 --> 06:00.494
Or, okay,
clearly I do,

06:00.528 --> 06:03.997
but I don't want to need
anyone's help, so...

06:04.031 --> 06:06.399
stop helping.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.836
I get it.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.540
After last week,
you feel you need to be
all renegade and broody.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.708
Taking yourself
out of the loop--

06:14.742 --> 06:18.745
I need to figure out who I am.
Another, something bad
is happening.

06:18.778 --> 06:24.151
I don't want my friends
out there alone right now,
okay?

06:28.656 --> 06:31.459
(no audible dialogue)

06:31.492 --> 06:35.028
Well, I--
I guess you guys
could use my help.

06:35.062 --> 06:40.300
Willow's not very good with
the practical strategizing...
except when she's evil.

06:40.332 --> 06:43.269
And Dawn,
she's not really
good for anything.

06:43.302 --> 06:47.574
WOMAN:
* When I think of you

06:47.608 --> 06:50.711
* I think
(sighs)

06:50.744 --> 06:53.713
* I'm just a fool
(mouthing words)

06:53.747 --> 06:58.284
* With handsome drink

06:58.317 --> 07:01.088
* It never fails

07:01.120 --> 07:07.461
* That I can't sleep
dreamin' of you *

07:07.495 --> 07:10.730
GIRL: You guys,
I've been thinking about it,
and I think I can still cheer.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.735
I mean, I could use a chair,
or we all could,
like the Laker Girls.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.737
GIRL #2: Oh, honey,
you need to concentrate
on getting better.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.240
Don't worry. We'll find
a replacement for you tomorrow.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.276
I just feel like I let you down.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.512
Hey, R.J.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.348
Oh. Dawn.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.350
Hey, Summers.

07:30.382 --> 07:33.620
Um, so,
I-I was wondering,

07:33.653 --> 07:37.557
you had Mr. Gurin for English
back at your old school, right?

07:38.558 --> 07:40.560
We all did.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.331
I have him this year.

07:48.668 --> 07:52.872
-What a drag.
-I actually kinda liked him.

07:52.906 --> 07:57.343
Right. Right. Uh, no, no.
I like him. It's just,

07:57.377 --> 08:00.781
you know, I-I meant "drag"
in a good, fun way.

08:00.814 --> 08:05.519
So, um, the tryouts tomorrow?
You gonna make the new girls
jump up and down a lot, right?

08:05.552 --> 08:07.620
(scoffs)
God, gross.

08:07.654 --> 08:11.925
A vending machine
fell on Cheryl, and all you can
think about is new cheerleaders?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.995
(chuckles)
Hey, um,
so, you know,

08:16.028 --> 08:18.130
I heard someone saying
yesterday that

08:18.165 --> 08:21.067
we're gonna go all the way
to the championships
this year...

08:21.100 --> 08:24.071
in football.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.305
We actually have a good shot,
considering we're a new team.

08:26.338 --> 08:30.711
Yeah, if you can get us past
Highland, we got a good shot.
Oh, like you could do better?

08:30.744 --> 08:33.980
-We'll see.
-You think coach would start
you at quarterback over me?

08:34.014 --> 08:37.717
I'm just saying.
The quarterback is the most
important member of the team.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.620
He is like the rudder
that guides the ship.

08:42.690 --> 08:46.559
Right. Could I give you
a hand with that?

08:46.594 --> 08:49.162
-Would you really?
-Oh, it's okay.
She can do it herself.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.865
Hey, we're all
on the same team, right?

08:55.635 --> 08:58.706
Yeah.
You're all on the team.

09:01.073 --> 09:04.277
We'll talk later, guys.
That's cool.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.682
MAN:
* And if you took to me

09:08.716 --> 09:13.285
* Like a gull
takes to the wind *

09:13.320 --> 09:17.356
* Well, I'd have jumped
from my trees *

09:17.389 --> 09:21.461
* And I'd have danced like
the king of the eyesores *
Go, Razorbacks!

09:21.494 --> 09:24.197
* And the rest of our lives
would've fared well *

09:24.230 --> 09:26.566
(scattered applause)
GIRL: Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.668
Up next we have...

09:29.903 --> 09:31.772
Dawn Summers.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.248
-Nice outfit.
-(crowd chuckles)

09:45.786 --> 09:50.322
(chanting)
Razorbacks! Razorbacks!
We're gonna play.

09:50.356 --> 09:54.394
We've got a secret weapon,
and his name is R.J.!

09:54.427 --> 09:58.398
Hear us cheer, hear us yell.
Listen what we say.

09:58.431 --> 10:03.636
Razorbacks! Razorbacks!
Go, R.J.!

10:03.671 --> 10:05.773
(yelps)

10:05.806 --> 10:07.740
Whoa.

10:07.774 --> 10:13.013
Okay. Thank you.
Very spirited.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.322
Come on, Dawnie.
Come out.
(sobbing)

10:23.355 --> 10:25.491
Dawn, sweetheart,
it's not that bad.

10:25.524 --> 10:29.162
How would you even know?
R.J.'s never gonna
notice me now.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.865
From what you said,
I'm sure he already noticed you.

10:31.899 --> 10:35.434
I mean, with the falling
and the-- spirit! Spirit!

10:35.467 --> 10:39.038
He-- They said you were
spirited, right?
Go away!

10:39.072 --> 10:41.709
Dawn.
sobbing)

10:41.741 --> 10:44.110
Things a lot better,
I see.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.779
I don't think
tonight's gonna be good
for videos, Xand.

10:46.813 --> 10:51.183
Right, with the wailing
and the crying. Still better
than a cozy evening with Spike.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.721
Shall I order a pizza?
Don't teens in a snit
like pizza?

10:54.754 --> 10:57.289
It is not a snit.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.327
I-I finally met him--
the guy of my dreams, okay?
And I blew it.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.562
R.J. hates me now.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.732
Dawn, what is that?

11:05.765 --> 11:09.601
Just the end of my life.
(sobs)

11:16.043 --> 11:18.211
Remember when she used to
have a crush on me?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.080
I miss the much cuter
"me" crush.

11:21.514 --> 11:27.187
(rock, on speaker, low)

11:29.088 --> 11:31.091
You shredded my outfit.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.426
I'll buy you a new one.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.764
That's not the point. I don't
want a new cheerleading outfit.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.165
Now, now,
let's not be hasty.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.033
Not the right time.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.974
(sighs)

11:48.274 --> 11:51.043
Dawn, I'm sorry
that you feel so bad.

11:51.077 --> 11:54.213
Okay? But in the morning,
this won't seem so terrible.
(sniffles)

11:54.246 --> 11:58.250
You don't even know
this R.J. Not really.

11:58.284 --> 12:02.089
I do know him.
I know his soul.

12:02.121 --> 12:07.961
Really? Dawn, he wasn't even
on your radar yesterday.
XANDER: It's the jacket.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.865
It's true. Something about the
big letter on the chest. Makes
girls get all swoony and crushy.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.566
I saw it all the time
in school.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.635
You couldn't just pin
any old felt letter
to your coat and get play.

12:16.668 --> 12:18.638
Not that I tried.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.140
It isn't a crush.

12:21.173 --> 12:25.044
It's love.
I love R.J.

12:25.077 --> 12:29.716
Again, since yesterday.
Dawn, it's awfully fast.

12:29.749 --> 12:34.421
What, you're telling me
I don't feel what I feel?
No, of course not.

12:34.453 --> 12:40.259
I believe that
you think it's real.
It seems real to you.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.394
(scoffs)
Know what?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.998
Maybe I don't want advice
from the dysfunction queen.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.269
You have no idea
how I feel.

12:50.302 --> 12:53.472
You have no idea
what real love is.

12:53.505 --> 12:56.844
Maybe if you did,
you wouldn't make fun
of me this way.

12:56.876 --> 13:00.480
Dawn, I'm not
making fun of you.
Just go.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.448
Leave me alone.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.655
(bell rings)

13:11.057 --> 13:14.427
Hey, Brooks.
Uh, I just talked to the coach.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.097
Yeah? I told you, man.
All those fumbles in practice--
he was gonna come down on you.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.933
I'm starting on Saturday.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.504
Great. Who knew
fumblin' all the time
was the key?

13:24.537 --> 13:28.674
It's just time to let
someone else have a turn, man.
And you knew this was comin'.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.576
Yeah, sure.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.515
(book clatters
in locker)

13:38.885 --> 13:41.453
You can't
do this to R.J.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.524
Oh, hey, it's you.
Nice cheering the other day.
(chuckles)

13:45.557 --> 13:50.797
It isn't fair. He works so hard.
What do you care? I mean,
this is how the game is played.

13:50.830 --> 13:56.202
It's dog eat dog.
May the best man win.
But nobody's better than R.J.

13:56.235 --> 14:01.073
(chuckles)
Yeah, well, that's not really
up to you, is it, hm?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.991
It all happened
so fast.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.727
I mean, one minute
he was walking,
and the next,

14:21.760 --> 14:23.763
he stumbled,
and then he fell.

14:23.796 --> 14:28.100
Why would he say
you pushed him
down the stairs?

14:28.134 --> 14:30.736
I don't know.
Maybe he was just embarrassed.

14:30.769 --> 14:36.408
It's hard being clumsy,
especially when you're
popular and athletic, I bet.

14:36.442 --> 14:40.712
Yeah. Well, to be candid,
it wouldn't be the first time
I caught O'Donnell in a lie.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.950
It would be nice if his lies
didn't involve my sister though.

14:42.982 --> 14:47.620
Anyway, I'm gonna have
to call Coach Wheeler and,
uh, tell him the bad news.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.788
Not a conversation
I really want to have.

14:49.822 --> 14:53.092
At least
he's still got R.J.
to take over.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.595
Yeah. Well, I think we have
everything we need for now.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.065
I'm sorry you had to get
involved in this, Dawn.

14:59.599 --> 15:03.269
That's okay.
I'm just really sorry
it happened.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.980
Summers! Hey.
Hi.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.583
I heard Wood hauled you
into his office.
Uh, well, yeah.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.586
About O'Donnell?
Yes.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.556
That sucks,
facin' the whole
inquisition thing.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.326
Yeah.
"No one expects
the Spanish Inquisition."

15:27.360 --> 15:31.163
(chuckles)
God. It's like I have
a disease or something.

15:31.197 --> 15:35.835
(sighs)
It was really no big deal.
No, it was.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.605
I think it's cool
that you faced him.
Wood.

15:38.638 --> 15:43.875
Well, we just talked.
He just wanted me
to tell him about the accident.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.812
Yeah.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.816
It sucks when these
things just happen,
outta nowhere.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.519
Right,
out of nowhere.

15:55.989 --> 16:00.126
You know, I was thinkin'
of headin' out tonight after
practice. You wanna meet up?

16:00.159 --> 16:02.028
Um--
(giggles)

16:03.529 --> 16:08.000
WOMAN:
* Hold what you've got

16:08.034 --> 16:11.370
* While Xenia
twists up the sky *

16:13.173 --> 16:15.607
* Akron flakes out

16:15.642 --> 16:20.613
* Grindcore
little fury *
* I feel hot tire

16:20.647 --> 16:25.118
* Why is it floating
You know, Spike definitely seems
a little more cogent, less--

16:25.152 --> 16:29.522
(burbling)
I'm just sayin'--
Once you get back the soul,

16:29.556 --> 16:33.860
doesn't that mean you start,
like, pickin' up your own
wet towels off the floor?

16:33.893 --> 16:37.897
No, but maybe you start
to feel really bad about
leaving them there.

16:37.929 --> 16:42.000
At least he's showering,
and that's a refreshing
and delightful change.

16:42.034 --> 16:45.004
-Buff.
-BUFFY: I think that's the guy.

16:45.105 --> 16:49.209
-What guy?
-The one who, according
to Dawn, is the, quote,

16:49.241 --> 16:51.344
"smartest, funniest,
coolest, hottest and

16:51.378 --> 16:55.414
"having-the-thickest-
boy-eyelashes boy
in school," unquote.

16:55.447 --> 16:58.451
He don't seem so tough.
Check out
the fan club.

17:03.289 --> 17:08.027
-Daddy like.
-What is that shirt
made of, paint?

17:08.060 --> 17:11.262
-Buff?
-Glad Dawnie isn't here to see
her precious boyfriend

17:11.298 --> 17:14.300
getting all thrusty
with some slutbag hussy--

17:18.637 --> 17:22.741
-Oh.
-Oh. Oh, no!
Daddy no--

17:22.775 --> 17:25.644
I wasn't--
When I was lookin'
I wasn't-- Oh, god.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.115
Right there with ya.

17:33.452 --> 17:37.356
* I got an empty case
of whippets
No more time on the meter *

17:37.390 --> 17:39.558
* Daybreak
about-face *

17:39.592 --> 17:41.394
So, do you have plans later?

17:41.427 --> 17:45.132
Or are you just gonna
go down to the docks,
wait for the fleet to come in?

17:45.164 --> 17:48.535
What?
Where do I start
with the bad?

17:48.567 --> 17:51.637
First, you told me
you were going
to the library.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.906
Second, you do not go
out on a date without
informing me first. Third,

17:54.941 --> 17:57.243
Anna Nicole Smith
thinks you look tacky.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.980
Yeah, well, I think I look hot
and so does R.J.
Oh, I bet he does.

18:01.012 --> 18:04.151
Maybe I should go have
a little word with him.
No!

18:04.183 --> 18:05.984
Don't you dare embarrass me
in front of him.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.387
I don't like this.
This boy has you acting crazy.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.557
It's my life.
I'll do what I want to.
I don't think so.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.162
Oh. So, what--
suddenly you're Mom now?
No, I'm not.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.829
And I am glad she's not here
to see you like this.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.970
Look, I'm sorry. I just--

18:24.002 --> 18:26.673
You just can't
handle it.
What?

18:26.705 --> 18:31.644
You've always been the
special one-- hot little Buffy
with her boyfriends. The Slayer.

18:31.678 --> 18:35.013
And now someone likes me,
and you just can't stand
that I'm getting the attention.

18:35.047 --> 18:38.750
That is the farthest thing
from true.
No, it's not.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.119
I'm sorry,
but I like the way
R.J. makes me feel,

18:41.153 --> 18:44.156
and if you think
that makes me a slut
or whatever, I don't care.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.960
Oh, no, no, no.
You are not going back
out on that dance floor.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.804
(empty can rattles)

19:03.742 --> 19:07.480
-R.J.?
-I know what
you're doing, slut.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.148
I saw you.
I saw you with R.J.

19:10.182 --> 19:14.287
So? We were just dancing.
Right.
You think I'm stupid?

19:14.320 --> 19:17.824
You're gonna
back off now.

19:17.856 --> 19:22.894
You know what's sad?
A girl who can't move on
when she's been dumped.

19:22.929 --> 19:26.932
He didn't dump me!
(both squealing, screaming)

19:37.277 --> 19:41.681
Okay. First with the lap dance,
now with the catfight. Hey,
wanna get drunk and barf next?

19:41.713 --> 19:43.750
Let go of me!
This isn't finished.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.152
I'll never let you
have him, bitch!

19:46.184 --> 19:49.556
R.J. is mine. I mean it.
Stay away from him!

19:49.588 --> 19:51.758
(sighs)

19:51.790 --> 19:54.961
Well, at least someone
agrees you shouldn't
be dating this guy.

19:57.263 --> 19:58.830
(bell rings)

19:58.865 --> 20:02.701
How about if you tried
doing your own homework
for a change, all right?

20:02.734 --> 20:07.105
No more getting these
young, impressionable women
to do it for you.

20:07.138 --> 20:11.109
Avoid detention, R.J.
Sound good?
Whatever.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.946
Oh, sweet, infectious
enthusiasm.

20:19.451 --> 20:23.055
Whoa, hang on there, slappy.
I'm not done with you yet.

20:23.088 --> 20:27.759
Oh, man. Like, it's not
bad enough I got that guy
ridin' my back all the time.

20:27.794 --> 20:31.897
-Now I gotta deal with you, too?
-Actually, I'm a bit more
formidable than Mr. Wood.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.366
You might come to look fondly
on his back riding.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.469
Yeah, but come on.
Sit.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.873
Hey, I told him
I was sorry
about the homework.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.376
Mm. Not the homework,
Mr. Wizard, the girls--

20:44.411 --> 20:47.814
what you're doing to them,
in specific, my sister.

20:47.846 --> 20:51.983
Hey, I-I didn't do anything
to your sister. And you saw
how hot she looked last night.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.587
I think that proved
that she--
Ah-ah, no more with the talky.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.557
(sighs)
Look, I know how guys
like you work.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.661
You turn on the charm, you get
whatever you want, no matter
who gets in your way, right?

21:01.693 --> 21:06.231
Okay. Look, it's not like
that. I just get along
really well with girls.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.569
Oh, I see how you get along.
"Ooh, look at me.
I'm Mr. Quarterback.

21:10.603 --> 21:16.742
"I crush little girls and
all their little feelings.
All I have to do is...

21:16.776 --> 21:19.511
"lead a...
team of high school athletes...

21:19.546 --> 21:23.148
"trying their best
to do a good job.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.817
"Everyone depending on me..."

21:25.852 --> 21:29.922
Boy, that is
a lot of pressure.
But...

21:29.955 --> 21:33.326
it doesn't mean
you get to disregard
other people's feelings.

21:33.359 --> 21:36.194
It's not like
I meant to
hurt anyone.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.699
No. I know that.

21:39.731 --> 21:44.302
It's just--
you're a leader.
A captain, okay?

21:44.336 --> 21:48.375
People look up to you,
and you need to keep
that in mind when you--

21:51.877 --> 21:55.213
I bet you run a lot, huh?

21:55.247 --> 21:59.486
I mean, they work you
pretty hard, don't they?

22:02.221 --> 22:06.959
Yeah. I guess so.

22:06.992 --> 22:11.329
I get that. I do.
I'm there.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.834
Or at least I was there
when I was still
in high school-- which I was

22:14.866 --> 22:19.038
just a couple
of years ago, really.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.039
You know, I-I just--
(chuckles)
realized,

22:21.073 --> 22:24.175
I-I'm basically
the same age as you.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.680
I'm not really older
at all, actually.

22:27.713 --> 22:31.718
I'm just like you...

22:31.750 --> 22:36.423
but with the sexual experience
and stuff.

22:36.455 --> 22:39.090
I think I hear
what you're saying.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.730
Uh, right.
(clears throat)
I'm--

22:44.763 --> 22:50.269
I'm really glad that we-- we had
this talk. So, uh, I think you
better get back to class then.

22:50.301 --> 22:54.205
Okay. Thanks.

22:54.240 --> 22:58.076
("Theme from A Summer Place")

22:58.109 --> 23:03.482
(continues)

23:04.717 --> 23:06.618
(giggles)

23:18.396 --> 23:21.400
BUFFY: Dawn, you wanna
come talk to me?

23:21.433 --> 23:23.335
Ambush.

23:31.978 --> 23:35.981
I wanted to tell you that
I talked to R.J. today.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.585
He's okay.
I think he likes you.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.421
Really?
Tell me what
he said about me--

23:42.454 --> 23:45.892
every word,
including intonation
and facial expressions.

23:45.924 --> 23:50.596
Well, he thinks you're--
you're funny and pretty
and interesting.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.999
Didn't have a thing
to say against you.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.003
Yes, he did.
I can tell.

24:00.271 --> 24:03.275
Just the tiniest thing.

24:03.308 --> 24:08.013
He might have said
that you came on
a little strong.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.449
Oh, my god.

24:10.482 --> 24:14.019
-I'm the pushy
queen of Slut Town.
-No, honey, honey. Not at all.

24:14.053 --> 24:18.958
No, no. It's just, you know,
lay back a little.
Let him come to you.

24:18.990 --> 24:24.530
I'm just scared that while I'm
laying back, some other girl's
gonna come and sweep him up.

24:24.564 --> 24:28.299
But we have inside info.
We know he doesn't like
being swept.

24:28.334 --> 24:30.970
He likes to be
the sweeper.

24:31.002 --> 24:35.775
Dawn, you're gonna
come out the winner here...
with me looking out for you.

24:35.807 --> 24:40.145
Yeah, I guess so.
Thank you.

24:43.715 --> 24:49.121
So, we do know that 6x + y = 16.
So, we can solve for "y"
in terms of--

24:49.154 --> 24:52.692
Sorry to interrupt.
Um, we need to see R.J. Brooks
down in the guidance office.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.608
There's no one here.

25:11.376 --> 25:13.412
Yeah, there is.

25:13.444 --> 25:15.948
There's one of you,

25:17.182 --> 25:19.518
and there's one of me.

25:22.555 --> 25:26.759
You were the one in math class.
Tell me what that adds up to.

25:31.963 --> 25:34.933
I'm not coming on too strong
if I just look at him.

25:37.202 --> 25:41.708
MAN:
* A warning sign

25:41.740 --> 25:46.712
* I missed the good part
BUFFY: I've always been
fascinated by football.

25:46.746 --> 25:50.215
(continues)
So, what's it like
to lead a team?

25:50.249 --> 25:52.384
The thing of it is
is the time.

25:52.417 --> 25:57.022
Nobody gets how much
time goes into it
with practices and games.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.358
I totally get it.
I was kinda juggling
some stuff

26:00.392 --> 26:02.961
when I was in high school, too,
which was also very recent.

26:02.994 --> 26:07.199
Principal Snyder
was always on me.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.536
Well, I still say Wood's
the worst. You haven't seen
the way that guy rides me.

26:10.568 --> 26:13.505
I wish somebody
would just get him
off my back.

26:14.773 --> 26:18.277
Yeah. That would be cool.

26:18.309 --> 26:20.346
And sometimes
I didn't even do
anything wrong.

26:24.851 --> 26:28.253
Oh, wow, you--
You're like a teacher.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.958
Not really.

26:31.990 --> 26:36.162
But I mean,
does it bother you?

26:36.194 --> 26:38.163
Not so much.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.935
-(bell rings)
-* I miss you

26:48.807 --> 26:51.477
* Yeah the truth is

26:55.714 --> 27:00.519
* That I miss you so

27:09.461 --> 27:11.363
(whimpers)

27:14.967 --> 27:18.470
Dawn, what's wrong?

27:18.503 --> 27:21.472
Is this--
Did that guy
in the jacket--

27:21.507 --> 27:24.676
(growls)
I don't even want
to hear his name anymore.

27:24.711 --> 27:27.713
I just called him
"that guy in the jacket."

27:27.747 --> 27:32.684
That's what I used to
call him in my head
before I knew his real name.

27:32.719 --> 27:38.324
Dawnie, honey, you seem...
extremely perturbed.
(sobs)

27:38.356 --> 27:40.826
Maybe I should go get Buffy.
No!
(sniffles)

27:42.493 --> 27:44.496
I don't ever want
to see her again.

27:44.529 --> 27:46.798
I thought this was about
that guy in the--

27:46.833 --> 27:50.568
the, um--
that guy with the thing.

27:50.602 --> 27:55.974
(sobs)
No. It's about both of them.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.477
(whimpers)

27:58.509 --> 28:01.480
(both moaning)
Buffy, I think
Dawn needs you-- Hey!

28:01.512 --> 28:05.718
Xander. Hi.
This is R.J.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.920
Uh, hey, guy.
It's called knocking.

28:07.953 --> 28:12.391
I'm sorry. It's just checkout
time was an hour ago. We were
hoping to make up the bed.

28:12.423 --> 28:16.028
And also, it's a classroom,
you chowderhead!

28:16.061 --> 28:18.730
Now, get off the boy, Buffy.
We're goin' home.

28:20.531 --> 28:24.737
(sobbing)
Dawn, please stop crying.
Please?

28:24.770 --> 28:28.106
Crying isn't gonna make
his love for me
go away, you know.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.742
Listen, you're
under a love spell.
That's what this has to be.

28:30.777 --> 28:34.079
You're right.
He's right.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.583
You're under a spell.
Oh, poor little Dawnie.

28:37.615 --> 28:39.919
But we're working on it.
It'll be better soon.

28:39.951 --> 28:44.589
Yes. Soon neither one of you
will be in love with this boy.

28:44.623 --> 28:47.459
-He's not a boy.
-What do you know
about our love?

28:47.492 --> 28:49.060
It's true and real.

28:49.095 --> 28:52.131
This isn't magic.
This is my heart.

28:52.163 --> 28:55.968
Fine.
We'll be
working.

28:56.001 --> 29:00.705
Look, I know this feels
terrible, but it isn't real.
Try to hold on to that.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.777
Did you hear that?
It isn't real.
You're just crazy.

29:04.810 --> 29:08.114
It is so real.
I love him.

29:08.146 --> 29:12.919
You knew how I felt-- like
I'd finally found something--
and you betrayed me.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.287
I betrayed you?

29:15.386 --> 29:19.125
You're the one that constructed
this elaborate fantasy
about you and my lover.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.292
Your "lover"?
Your "lover"?

29:21.326 --> 29:23.761
Guys, guys--
I tried to get you
to back away.

29:23.796 --> 29:28.666
-That's right. You lied to me.
-But did you want me to tell
you that he's in love with me,

29:28.700 --> 29:32.238
that your little crush
is hopeless?
It's not a crush!

29:32.270 --> 29:35.574
Stop! You're not
supposed to do this.
Why?

29:35.606 --> 29:40.246
Because he's younger than me?
You know, I am extremely
youthful and peppy.

29:40.278 --> 29:44.282
No. 'Cause you were
the one I trusted.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.221
Dawn, wait!
(door slams)

29:52.624 --> 29:56.261
Crazy little lust puppies,
aren't they?
At least the yelling went away.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.030
It was startin' to sound
like Christmas morning
with my family.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.867
Love spells. People forget
how dangerous they can be.

30:01.901 --> 30:05.336
-Hey, been there.
-WOMEN: Xander! Xander! Xander!

30:05.371 --> 30:07.906
Stop it! Stop!

30:09.674 --> 30:13.378
-Good times.
-Here. Something.

30:13.412 --> 30:17.516
(sighs)
She's locked her door. That
spell has her good and loopy.

30:17.548 --> 30:20.952
-Info on one R.J. Brooks.
-Oh! Let me see.
Is there a picture?

30:20.987 --> 30:23.855
Family stuff.
Hey, I knew his brother.

30:23.890 --> 30:27.393
He was a big jock
at Sunnydale High, too,
a couple of years ahead of us.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.795
He used to stick
chewing gum in my hair.

30:29.827 --> 30:32.798
-Hm.
-What are you thinkin'?

30:32.830 --> 30:36.501
Well, I think my relationship
with R.J.'s brother
was complex at best,

30:36.535 --> 30:39.505
but maybe
he's a way in.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.873
Now look
for a picture.

30:42.942 --> 30:46.077
I'm just sayin', we're--
we're tangling with
a powerful spell here,

30:46.112 --> 30:50.648
and we don't know what the deal
is, so-- so keep an eye out
if this guy looks twitchy.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.518
And don't let this guy
charm you either.

30:52.550 --> 30:57.056
He had everyone around him
practically kissing his ring
back in high school.

30:57.088 --> 30:58.690
(doorbell rings)

31:00.425 --> 31:03.028
(door opens, creaks)

31:03.061 --> 31:05.396
Yeah?

31:08.599 --> 31:10.769
Construction, huh?
That's awesome.
XANDER: Yeah.

31:10.801 --> 31:14.906
So, what's up with R.J.?
How's he doin' at the old
"alpha" mater?

31:14.941 --> 31:18.044
Uh, good.
It's just,

31:18.076 --> 31:21.779
I know a girl that might
be goin' out with him,
and I was wondering--

31:21.813 --> 31:23.382
Got it. You wanna know
if he's a good guy?

31:23.414 --> 31:27.519
Truth is, he's the best.
Followin' in my footsteps.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.122
You might not know it now,
lookin' at me
with a couple extra pounds,

31:30.155 --> 31:33.092
but back then
I was quite the guy.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.427
Yeah. I gather that
R.J. is pretty popular, too.

31:36.461 --> 31:41.366
Hey, I gotta tell ya.
There was a time
I was worried about R.J.

31:41.400 --> 31:46.704
Used to be all into comic books,
Model U.N., geek stuff.
No offense, Harris.

31:46.738 --> 31:50.041
One time, I found
all this poetry
under his bed.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.778
Turns out he wrote it.

31:52.810 --> 31:57.615
Then he, uh-- what do
you call it-- blossomed.
That's what it was like.

31:57.648 --> 32:02.087
And do you have any idea
why he,

32:02.121 --> 32:04.155
you know, burst into
a flower all of a sudden?

32:04.190 --> 32:06.291
SPIKE: You're wearing
your brother's jacket.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.493
Here in this picture.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.463
Oh, no, dude. He's wearin' mine.
That jacket was with me
all the way through high school.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.400
Gave it to him
when I graduated.

32:14.432 --> 32:18.470
Right before I started
over at the Pizza Barn.
I'm in the management program.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.939
So, Lance, where did you
get the jacket?

32:20.972 --> 32:26.345
Oh, Dad gave it to me. Made
a big deal about it, too, how
he met Mom wearin' that jacket.

32:26.377 --> 32:29.780
She was a former Miss Arkansas.
Very hot in her day.

32:29.815 --> 32:32.651
Wow. That's wonderful.
Boy, it's gettin' late.

32:32.683 --> 32:35.820
Hey, you guys don't have to
take off if you don't want to.
I-I got

32:35.854 --> 32:38.124
sort of a rumpus room
set up in the basement.

32:38.156 --> 32:41.027
There's air hockey
and a mini fridge.

32:41.059 --> 32:43.461
We could party.

32:43.494 --> 32:46.664
WOMAN:
Lance, do you have
guests down there?

32:46.698 --> 32:51.470
-There's little boxes
of raisins if you want snacks.
-We really gotta go.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.538
(keystrokes)
(sighs)
Damn love spell.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.775
I have tried every
anti-love spell spell
I can find.

32:56.807 --> 32:59.845
Even if you found the right one,
guy would probably just do

32:59.877 --> 33:03.148
an anti-anti-love spell spell...
spell.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.982
What?
(doorbell rings)

33:05.017 --> 33:09.055
I'll get it.
Maybe it's Xander with
some answers from the brother.

33:12.590 --> 33:16.295
-Oh. You have to be--
-I was lookin' for Buffy--
Miss Summers?

33:16.327 --> 33:20.531
-Buffy's not here.
Go away.
-You sure?

33:20.566 --> 33:23.368
No Buffy for you.
Leave quickly now.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.404
Uh-huh. Okay.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.374
Tell her to call me.

33:29.407 --> 33:31.643
Man.
(whew)

33:31.676 --> 33:33.545
Good thing Buffy and Dawn
are upstairs.

33:33.578 --> 33:37.848
If they knew
he was here--
 ("Theme from A Summer Place")

33:37.883 --> 33:42.087
(continues)

33:48.059 --> 33:52.198
But you don't even know him.
Yes, I do. I looked into him,
and I saw his soul.

33:52.230 --> 33:55.834
He was walking away.
So, unless his soul
is in his ass--

33:55.866 --> 33:58.170
A.J. is my best friend
and my dearest darling.

33:58.203 --> 34:03.209
It's "R.J.," and what you
were picking up on was his
deep caring and devotion to me.

34:03.241 --> 34:06.612
-What's going on?
-Willow thinks she's in love
with my boyfriend, R.J.

34:06.644 --> 34:09.347
What? No!
You two can't do this.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.284
Willow, you're a gay woman...
and he isn't.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.719
This isn't about
his physical presence.

34:14.753 --> 34:18.356
-It's about his heart.
-His physical presence
has a penis!

34:18.389 --> 34:22.228
-I can work around it.
-This isn't fair. How can
you all be doing this to me?

34:22.260 --> 34:27.233
Okay. Wait. Everyone wait.
Just calm down, okay?
I think I know what this is.

34:27.266 --> 34:32.271
Clearly, you've both
been affected by the same
love spell that got Dawn.

34:32.304 --> 34:35.306
This isn't a spell.
He owns my heart.

34:35.340 --> 34:38.577
Dawn, be quiet.
We're trying to work this out.
We don't need you interfering.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.813
There's a simple answer
to this. Just think about
who loves him the most.

34:41.847 --> 34:46.418
Clearly I do, since
I'm willing to look past
the whole orientation thing.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.320
-I need him.
-Well, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

34:49.355 --> 34:53.090
I'd kill for him.
You'd kill
for a chocolate bar.

34:53.125 --> 34:56.161
No. Yes! Kill for him.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.463
I'm a Slayer.
"Slayer" means "kill."

34:58.496 --> 35:03.469
Oh! I'll kill
the principal.
Hm. That is hard to top.

35:03.501 --> 35:08.306
Yeah? Well, I have skills.
I can prove my love with magic.

35:08.340 --> 35:12.411
Yeah, right. What are
you gonna do? Use magic
to make him into a girl?

35:12.443 --> 35:15.079
Oh, damn.

35:15.112 --> 35:16.715
ANYA: Oh, wait!
I know what he'll like.

35:22.653 --> 35:24.822
Sorry, Dawnie.

35:24.856 --> 35:30.396
-You're never gonna get him.
-No, never.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.875
(train horn blares, distant)

36:27.585 --> 36:30.255
O Hecate, I call on you.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.057
I humbly ask your will be done.

36:33.090 --> 36:36.193
Hear my request,
a simple change--

36:36.228 --> 36:38.530
(thunderclap)
Create a daughter from a s--

36:38.563 --> 36:40.398
(crystals pattering)

36:40.431 --> 36:44.068
(scoffs)
Oh, man. Now I've got to start
all over. Hecate hates that.

36:44.101 --> 36:48.039
What the hell are you doing?
Proving I love
R.J. the most.

36:48.072 --> 36:52.710
Wil, honey,
R.J.'s a guy.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.746
I did notice that, yeah.
That's why I'm doin' my spell,

36:55.780 --> 36:57.748
'cause, you know,
he doesn't have to be.

36:57.782 --> 37:01.286
Now, hand me back my crystals.
I don't have much time.
Much time before what?

37:01.320 --> 37:03.722
Before Buffy and Anya
and Dawn have a chance
to prove that

37:03.822 --> 37:06.056
they love R.J. the most.
And how are they gonna
do that exactly?

37:06.090 --> 37:10.061
Well, Buffy's gonna
kill Principal Wood--
Fine. Okay. Let's start there.

37:10.094 --> 37:15.333
(soft Latin jazz)

37:20.170 --> 37:22.072
(Spike roars, distant)

37:23.641 --> 37:25.476
(Buffy yells, distant)

37:38.856 --> 37:40.090
Hey!

37:42.527 --> 37:45.463
(panting)
What are you guys doing?

37:45.496 --> 37:48.666
Locator spell,
human variety.
Almost done.

37:48.699 --> 37:53.739
Well, I've got a principal
to kill. What's going on?
Who are we looking for?

37:53.771 --> 37:58.510
(train horn blares, loud)

38:07.117 --> 38:11.690
You realize that Anya's probably
seducing R.J. even as we speak.
My God, you think so?

38:11.722 --> 38:14.125
Well, I wouldn't put it
past her. She's recently
evil, you know.

38:14.159 --> 38:16.494
(horn blaring, louder)
Well, so am I.
Why should I miss out?

38:16.527 --> 38:18.929
Hey, crazy chicks,
look.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.632
-Dawn?
-(horn continues)

38:20.666 --> 38:22.467
-Dawn!
-Buffy!

38:24.835 --> 38:26.137
(train horn #2 blasts)

39:01.706 --> 39:03.742
What were you doing?
What is this?

39:03.775 --> 39:09.014
It doesn't matter.
This is a plan? You're gonna
steal R.J. by being trisected?

39:09.047 --> 39:11.081
What, am I gonna
compete with you?

39:11.115 --> 39:15.085
You're older and hotter
and have sex that's rough
and kill people.

39:15.119 --> 39:19.824
I don't have any of that stuff.
Um, but if I did this,
then his whole life he'd know

39:19.858 --> 39:23.429
there was someone
that loved him so much
they'd give up their life.

39:23.461 --> 39:24.695
Dawn.

39:24.730 --> 39:28.900
(sighs)
And it would be true...
forever.

39:28.934 --> 39:32.003
No guy is worth your life,
not ever.

39:32.036 --> 39:36.507
R.J. is, and don't
say he isn't. Look what
you were willing to do.

39:36.541 --> 39:42.246
Dawn, I would give him to you
in a second if I could. That's
how much you're scaring me.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.619
But I-- I thought
you wanted him,
for you.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.858
Nah.

39:52.891 --> 39:56.027
Well, yeah.

39:56.061 --> 39:59.565
My god, that boy is hot.

39:59.597 --> 40:04.135
Sorry.
I think I might
be under a spell here.

40:04.168 --> 40:05.402
I hear ya.

40:15.246 --> 40:19.016
Now, you're sure
you understand the plan?
I think I got it. Yeah.

40:22.454 --> 40:23.755
Hey! Hey!

40:23.789 --> 40:25.623
Ow!
(gasps)

40:29.494 --> 40:33.097
(rock, on speaker, low)
That, my friends, is the smell
of sweet, sweet victory.

40:33.130 --> 40:36.902
(continues)
Also burning
cotton-poly blend.

40:36.934 --> 40:40.005
Xander, be honest.
You didn't, you know,
think about

40:40.038 --> 40:42.340
slippin' that jacket on
just a little bit?

40:42.373 --> 40:45.275
I refuse to answer that
on the grounds
that it didn't fit.

40:45.309 --> 40:49.014
Man, this tool gets
this jacket from his brother,

40:49.047 --> 40:52.117
who got it from their father,
and we'll never know
where he got it.

40:52.150 --> 40:56.788
That bites.
Nah, welcome to the Hellmouth,
where even outerwear isn't safe.

40:56.822 --> 41:00.291
-I can't believe I almost--
-I can't believe I almost--

41:00.324 --> 41:02.760
It was a spell.
We were helpless.

41:02.793 --> 41:06.931
We're not responsible
for anything we did,
morally or, you know, legally.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.635
True. You fell for
a mystical, ancient curse.

41:09.668 --> 41:12.804
Who hasn't made that mistake,
mm, seven, eight times?

41:17.742 --> 41:21.478
You hear that?
Not your fault.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.614
(sighs)

41:23.648 --> 41:25.951
I'm just so--

41:25.983 --> 41:30.722
The way I acted,
the way I talked
to you--

41:30.755 --> 41:33.525
I feel so stupid.
All over a spell.

41:35.159 --> 41:38.329
Get ready to feel
even stupider
when it's not.

41:40.097 --> 41:44.369
Hey, Anya,
you never told us what you
"can't believe you almost--"

41:44.402 --> 41:46.538
"Almost" who now?

41:46.572 --> 41:51.175
No. You can't be the only
not-embarrassed one.
What did you do?

41:51.208 --> 41:55.346
Uh--
I, uh, wrote a poem,

41:55.380 --> 41:57.648
an epic poem,

41:57.682 --> 42:01.853
-comparing him to a daisy,
and a tower and a lake.
 -(stops)

42:01.887 --> 42:05.090
ANNOUNCER: And now the latest
on Sunnydale's late-night bandit
who is still at large.

42:05.123 --> 42:07.659
-A masked thief
held up a number of--
-(switch clicks)

42:07.693 --> 42:10.728
Okay. Great.
Ice cream. My treat?

42:37.588 --> 42:39.990
Grr! Arrgh!
