LEVEL OF BRAINWASHING IN SOME

09:20.300 --> 09:22.333
PEOPLE, AND THE UNDERSTANDING

09:22.400 --> 09:23.366
THEY TRULY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

09:23.433 --> 09:24.700
FIGHTING AGAINST THE FORCES OF

09:24.766 --> 09:27.866
EVIL JUST BECAUSE THE PERSON

09:27.933 --> 09:31.266
THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THE SECOND

09:31.333 --> 09:32.333
COMING BASICALLY TURNED OUT TO

09:32.400 --> 09:32.633
LOSE.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.300
>> Bill: DO YOU BELIEVE THERE

09:33.366 --> 09:35.733
IS SUCH A THING AS A DEVIL?

09:35.800 --> 09:39.966
>> I DO, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

09:40.033 --> 09:43.700
>> Bill: OKAY, BUT THEN YOU'RE

09:43.766 --> 09:44.900
TALKING ABOUT BRAINWASHING -- IF

09:44.966 --> 09:45.733
YOU BELIEVE THERE'S SUCH A THING

09:45.800 --> 09:48.266
AS A DEVIL TO BEGIN WITH, AREN'T

09:48.333 --> 09:50.833
WE HALFWAY TO NONSENSE RIGHT

09:50.900 --> 09:51.866
THERE?

09:51.933 --> 09:53.766
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE BUT

09:53.833 --> 09:55.500
LISTEN, I'LL TELL YOU I WAS

09:55.566 --> 09:57.866
SITTING THERE ON INSURRECTION

09:57.933 --> 10:00.266
DAY AND I FELT LITERALLY PURE

10:00.333 --> 10:02.366
EVIL COMING INTO THE CAPITAL.

10:02.433 --> 10:04.400
I'VE TALKED TO MANY OF THE

10:04.466 --> 10:06.200
OFFICERS INCLUDING THE GUY WHO

10:06.266 --> 10:07.966
WAS DRAGGED DOWN THE STAIRS AND

10:08.033 --> 10:08.833
TOLD TO KILL HIM WITH HIS OWN

10:08.900 --> 10:09.933
GUN AND HE SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN

10:10.000 --> 10:12.166
PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

10:12.233 --> 10:13.900
IF YOU CALL IT EVIL OR NOT, IT

10:13.966 --> 10:18.900
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS RAISING

10:18.966 --> 10:22.733
THESE PEOPLE, IF YOU GO TO THE

10:22.800 --> 10:23.666
CAPITAL OF DESTROYED YOU'RE

10:23.733 --> 10:24.966
SOMEHOW DOING SERVICE TO YOUR

10:25.033 --> 10:25.700
COUNTRY.

10:25.766 --> 10:27.100
>> Bill: YOU FEEL AND I'M GLAD

10:27.166 --> 10:28.000
YOU DO AND I'M WISHING YOU THE

10:28.066 --> 10:30.166
BEST FOR THE PROJECT YOU CAN

10:30.233 --> 10:33.533
RECLAIM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

10:33.600 --> 10:33.766
>> I DO.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.633
>> Bill: I'M LOOKING AT THE

10:36.700 --> 10:38.300
NUMBERS AND YOU WOULD NEED A

10:38.366 --> 10:41.566
SWING OF ABOUT 40 POINTS.

10:41.633 --> 10:44.166
TRUMP WANTS TO START HIS OWN

10:44.233 --> 10:45.233
PARTY, 33% OF REPUBLICANS ARE

10:45.300 --> 10:48.566
DOWN WITH THAT RIGHT AWAY,

10:48.633 --> 10:50.233
ANOTHER 37% SAY PROBABLY,

10:50.300 --> 10:55.233
MAYBE -- ONLY 30% ARE WITH

10:55.300 --> 10:56.933
REPUBLICAN CLASSIC.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.900
FOR YOU TO RECLAIM THE PARTY, I

10:59.966 --> 11:01.633
THINK YOU WOULD NEED A SWING OF

11:01.700 --> 11:02.833
ABOUT 40 PERCENTAGE POINTS, HOW

11:02.900 --> 11:06.666
CAN YOU REALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT?

11:06.733 --> 11:08.066
>> IT IS HERCULEAN AND THE THING

11:08.133 --> 11:11.000
I'VE LOOKED AT IS THERE HAS BEEN

11:11.066 --> 11:13.933
NO COUNTER VOICE IN THE PARTY TO

11:14.000 --> 11:14.933
DONALD TRUMP, EVERYBODY HAS BEEN

11:15.000 --> 11:15.900
SCARED AND THAT'S WHERE I

11:15.966 --> 11:18.200
FINALLY DECIDED TO BE JUST

11:18.266 --> 11:19.233
EXTREMELY BOLD ABOUT IT IS TO

11:19.300 --> 11:20.933
SAY PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THE

11:21.000 --> 11:22.400
OTHER SIDE OF THAT SCUM OF THE

11:22.466 --> 11:24.766
NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THERE IS A

11:24.833 --> 11:25.433
RICH HISTORY IN THE REPUBLICAN

11:25.500 --> 11:29.300
PARTY, WE CAN BE BETTER.

11:29.366 --> 11:31.233
I BASICALLY JUST DID A VIDEO AND

11:31.300 --> 11:34.900
PUT IT ON CountryFirst.com

11:34.966 --> 11:38.700
AND I DID IT WITH THE INTENTION

11:38.766 --> 11:39.333
OF SAYING 20,000 EMAIL SIGN-UPS

11:39.400 --> 11:43.766
IN 24 HOURS AND IT SHOWED IT'S

11:43.833 --> 11:45.566
NOT JUST DISAFFECTED

11:45.633 --> 11:46.166
REPUBLICANS, IT'S INDEPENDENT

11:46.233 --> 11:47.500
OFS AND ITS SOME DEMOCRATS WERE

11:47.566 --> 11:48.766
LIKE WE WANT A SAY IN REPUBLICAN

11:48.833 --> 11:50.966
PARTY, ALL I CAN DO IS PUT IT IN

11:51.033 --> 11:52.833
THE FIELD -- I MAY FAIL AND I'M

11:52.900 --> 11:54.933
AT PEACE WITH TRYING BUT

11:55.000 --> 11:55.566
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

11:55.633 --> 11:56.566
>> Bill: YOU'RE WILLING TO

11:56.633 --> 12:02.133
LOSE YOUR JOB.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.900
YOU SAY YOU BEEN IN CONGRESS 11

12:04.966 --> 12:05.100
YEARS?

12:05.166 --> 12:08.233
>> I HAVE.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.666
>> Bill: YOU'VE SERVED

12:09.733 --> 12:10.266
OVERSEAS, YOU'VE BEEN IN

12:10.333 --> 12:16.333
WORKPLACES TO MAKE WORSE PLACES

12:16.400 --> 12:16.666
THAN CONGRESS.

12:16.733 --> 12:18.600
TELL ME WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT

12:18.666 --> 12:20.100
THIS JOB THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING

12:20.166 --> 12:21.200
TO SELL THEIR SOULS, IS IT JUST

12:21.266 --> 12:22.366
BECAUSE YOU GET A STAFF AND YOU

12:22.433 --> 12:25.300
GET A CELEBRITY, IS THAT IT?

12:25.366 --> 12:30.800
YOU DON'T NEED ANY SKILLS BUT

12:30.866 --> 12:32.266
I'M SAYING IT'S ONE OF THE FEW

12:32.333 --> 12:34.333
JOBS IN AMERICA, THERE'S NO

12:34.400 --> 12:34.933
CHECKS, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS

12:35.000 --> 12:35.766
GET PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR YOU, YOU

12:35.833 --> 12:37.200
CAN BE THE BIGGEST MORON IN THE

12:37.266 --> 12:39.266
WORLD AND I'VE INTERVIEWED SOME

12:39.333 --> 12:40.300
OF THEM.

12:40.366 --> 12:41.900
ALL YOU NEED IS A CLIP ON HIGH

12:41.966 --> 12:45.666
AND THE VOTES AND YOU'RE THERE.

12:45.733 --> 12:46.266
WHAT IS IT?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.533
IS THAT REALLY WHAT IT IS?

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP

12:48.666 --> 12:49.933
THE JOB THAT GIVES THEM A KIND

12:50.000 --> 12:52.466
OF CELEBRITY?

12:52.533 --> 12:55.400
>> I THINK IT IS, I THINK SOME

12:55.466 --> 12:57.100
OF IT IS JUST FEAR BUT I THINK

12:57.166 --> 12:58.466
IT'S YOU SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE

12:58.533 --> 13:00.133
TRYING TO GET TO CONGRESS.

13:00.200 --> 13:00.833
IT'S A BIG DEAL TO GET THE

13:00.900 --> 13:02.300
CONGRESS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

13:02.366 --> 13:03.300
WHEN YOU THINK THAT'S YOUR

13:03.366 --> 13:05.900
TERMINAL JOB OR YOU'RE GOING TO

13:05.966 --> 13:08.066
GO HIGHER, YOU LIVE IN FEAR OF

13:08.133 --> 13:08.566
ANYTHING YOU DO.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.533
WHAT HAVE CONSTANTLY SAID TO

13:10.600 --> 13:13.100
PEOPLE IS THIS: AS A MILITARY

13:13.166 --> 13:15.900
GUY MYSELF, IF WE'RE GOING TO

13:15.966 --> 13:17.233
ASK YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE WILLING

13:17.300 --> 13:18.366
TO GIVE THEIR LIFE FOR THE

13:18.433 --> 13:20.700
COUNTRY, HOW DARE WE NOT BE

13:20.766 --> 13:22.933
WILLING TO GIVE OUR CAREER FOR

13:23.000 --> 13:27.700
SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT BE LIKE

13:27.766 --> 13:31.500
WARFARE.

13:31.566 --> 13:32.800
>> Bill: HERE IS THE TOUGHEST

13:32.866 --> 13:34.533
QUESTION YOU'RE GOING TO GET

13:34.600 --> 13:36.333
FROM ME.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.700
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

13:37.766 --> 13:40.333
2016, YOU WATCHED TRUMP RON AND

13:40.400 --> 13:46.233
YOU SAID "WHOA, W I'M A REPUBLIN

13:46.300 --> 13:49.300
BUT I CAN'T BOOK FOR THE SKY."

13:49.366 --> 13:51.066
HE WATCHED HIM FOR FOUR YEARS,

13:51.133 --> 13:52.566
YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM IN 2016,

13:52.633 --> 13:55.633
YOU VOTED FOR HIM IN 2020 AFTER

13:55.700 --> 13:59.500
WHAT YOU SAW WHAT HE DID AS

13:59.566 --> 14:00.166
PRESIDENT.

14:00.233 --> 14:01.866
EXPLAIN THAT TO ME AND WHO DID

14:01.933 --> 14:04.533
YOU VOTE FOR IN 2016?

14:04.600 --> 14:06.366
>> IN 2016 I WROTE SOMEBODY IN.

14:06.433 --> 14:07.000
>> Bill: WHO?

14:07.066 --> 14:09.433
>> I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER NOW,

14:09.500 --> 14:09.700
ACTUALLY.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.433
>> Bill: OH COME ON.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.700
YOU WERE DOING SO WELL.

14:16.766 --> 14:18.266
THE THAT'S -- COME ON, JUST SAY

14:18.333 --> 14:20.200
ANYBODY.

14:20.266 --> 14:22.666
YOUR WIFE, MITT ROMNEY, LINCOLN.

14:22.733 --> 14:24.966
>> I WROTE YOU IN.

14:25.033 --> 14:34.166
>> Bill: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

14:34.233 --> 14:35.133
SO YOU'RE ASHAMED OF YOUR

14:35.200 --> 14:36.666
FICTITIOUS WRITE IN VOTE?

14:36.733 --> 14:37.766
>> I AM NOW, YES.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.466
IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME NOW,

14:40.533 --> 14:43.333
I WOULD VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN IN A

14:43.400 --> 14:43.866
HEARTBEAT, THE THING THAT

14:43.933 --> 14:46.033
DIFFERENTIATED IT A LOT FOR ME,

14:46.100 --> 14:46.900
AFTER THE ELECTION AND

14:46.966 --> 14:49.300
UNDERMINING THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF

14:49.366 --> 14:51.066
THE ELECTION, YOU CAN EVEN SAY

14:51.133 --> 14:52.133
CRAZY STUFF AS PRESIDENT -- WHEN

14:52.200 --> 14:53.900
YOU START TO SAY THE ELECTION

14:53.966 --> 14:55.133
DOESN'T WORK, IT'S RIGGED,

14:55.200 --> 15:01.033
EVERYTHING, THAT IS STEP 1 OR

15:01.100 --> 15:01.800
STEP 2 OR 3 OF DESTROYING A

15:01.866 --> 15:03.900
CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC.

15:03.966 --> 15:04.166
[APPLAUSE]

15:04.233 --> 15:07.300
>> Bill: I COULDN'T AGREE MORE

15:07.366 --> 15:09.133
MORE.

15:09.200 --> 15:09.766
WHY DIDN'T NANCY PELOSI ASK YOU

15:09.833 --> 15:14.000
AND LIZ CHENEY, WHO ALSO HAD THE

15:14.066 --> 15:16.533
GUTS TO STAND UP -- WHY DIDN'T

15:16.600 --> 15:18.933
THEY ASK YOU TO BE IMPEACHMENT

15:19.000 --> 15:19.200
MANAGERS?

15:19.266 --> 15:21.700
I WOULDN'T SAY IT WOULD CHANGE

15:21.766 --> 15:23.233
THE VERDICT BECAUSE OF COURSE

15:23.300 --> 15:25.066
HE'S NOT GOING TO GET CONVICTED

15:25.133 --> 15:26.400
BUT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A MUCH

15:26.466 --> 15:28.233
MORE COMPELLING CASE FOR THE

15:28.300 --> 15:29.166
COUNTRY TO WATCH WITH TWO

15:29.233 --> 15:31.466
REPUBLICANS AS IMPEACHMENT

15:31.533 --> 15:31.833
MANAGERS?

15:31.900 --> 15:33.300
>> I THINK IN THEORY IT WOULD

15:33.366 --> 15:34.033
BE.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.233
>> Bill: YOU WOULD'VE TAKEN

15:35.300 --> 15:36.000
IT.

15:36.066 --> 15:36.633
YOU WOULD'VE DONE HIT?

15:36.700 --> 15:40.100
>> MAY BECOME I DON'T KNOW,

15:40.166 --> 15:41.733
PROBABLY.

15:41.800 --> 15:48.233
I NEVER WAS EVEN ASKED.

15:48.300 --> 15:48.833
DURING THE IMPEACHMENT VOTE I

15:48.900 --> 15:51.466
WANTED TO GO DOWN AND SPEAK ON

15:51.533 --> 15:52.633
IT AND I ASKED FOR TIME FROM THE

15:52.700 --> 15:55.033
DEMOCRATS AND GOT A MINUTE, TO

15:55.100 --> 15:55.900
THEIR CREDIT, I THOUGHT THAT

15:55.966 --> 15:57.033
WOULD'VE MADE SOME SENSE IF THEY

15:57.100 --> 15:58.133
WOULD'VE GIVE HER AN REPUBLICANS

15:58.200 --> 15:59.233
TIME TO GO DOWN AND MAKE THE

15:59.300 --> 16:01.700
CASE INSTEAD OF 45-SECOND

16:01.766 --> 16:02.766
SPEECHES BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

16:02.833 --> 16:03.133
POLITICS.

16:03.200 --> 16:03.766
EVERYONE WANTS TO HAVE THEIR SAY

16:03.833 --> 16:06.600
AND THERE'S LIMITED TIME AND ALL

16:06.666 --> 16:06.833
OF THAT.

16:06.900 --> 16:07.933
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT

16:08.033 --> 16:09.033
FROM YOUR NEXT PRIMARY FREIGHT

16:09.100 --> 16:11.500
IF YOU DO RUN AGAIN?

16:11.566 --> 16:15.566
>> IT'S GOING TO BE FUN.

16:15.633 --> 16:16.100
I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF

16:16.166 --> 16:16.900
PRIMARIES AND PEOPLE ALWAYS

16:16.966 --> 16:17.800
THINK THEY CAN BEAT ME AND THE

16:17.866 --> 16:19.666
TRUTH IS YOU JUST PAY ATTENTION

16:19.733 --> 16:22.333
TO WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND QUIT

16:22.400 --> 16:23.333
PEDALING IN FEAR.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.066
PEOPLE ACTUALLY REACT TO

16:25.133 --> 16:25.666
OPTIMISM.

16:25.733 --> 16:27.633
FEAR, WHEN IT'S LEGIT, I'M

16:27.700 --> 16:29.100
SCARED OF COVID AND SCARED OF

16:29.166 --> 16:30.933
DISUNITY IN THE COUNTRY COME I'M

16:31.000 --> 16:31.600
NOT SCARED OF DEMOCRATS.

16:31.666 --> 16:32.233
>> Bill: THAT'S NOT WHO YOU

16:32.300 --> 16:33.800
SHOULD BE SCARED OF, YOU SHOULD

16:33.866 --> 16:37.500
BE SCARED OF REPUBLICANS DEAR

16:37.566 --> 16:37.700
RIGHT.

16:37.766 --> 16:40.466
[APPLAUSE]

16:40.533 --> 16:42.133
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, WHAT'S

16:42.200 --> 16:43.566
GONNA GO ON AND NOT FIGHT?

16:43.633 --> 16:45.766
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY

16:45.833 --> 16:46.300
FOR YOU.

16:46.366 --> 16:47.466
>> I THINK A LOT OF THE TIME

16:47.533 --> 16:50.000
IT'S A PAPER TIGER BECAUSE QUITE

16:50.066 --> 16:51.000
HONESTLY DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE

16:51.066 --> 16:53.733
LESS AND LESS RELEVANT EVERY

16:53.800 --> 16:55.300
DAY, IF YOU TELL PEOPLE THE TRU-

16:55.366 --> 16:56.500
I'VE HAD THE RIGHT COME AT

16:56.566 --> 16:57.033
ME IN EVERY PRIMARY AND I

16:57.100 --> 17:00.400
WOULD MAKE HUGE AND I THINK

17:00.466 --> 17:01.933
IT'S GOOD TO HAPPEN AGAIN THIS

17:02.000 --> 17:02.733
TIME.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.900
I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND FIGHT

17:03.966 --> 17:05.766
HARD AND IF I LOSE, I'M AT

17:05.833 --> 17:06.433
PEACE.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.666
>> Bill: IF YOU WANT ME TO

17:07.733 --> 17:10.300
CAMPAIGN FOR YOU, I'M THERE.

17:10.366 --> 17:12.233
ADAM KINZINGER, WE APPRECIATE

17:12.300 --> 17:13.000
YOU BEING HERE.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.800
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

ALL RIGHT, IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

17:22.066 --> 17:22.900
HE'S THE FOUNDER OF THE DAILY

17:22.966 --> 17:24.033
KOS AND CO-HOST OF DAILY KOS'

17:24.100 --> 17:27.133
PODCAST "THE BRIEF": MARKOS

17:27.200 --> 17:30.466
MOULITSAS.

17:30.533 --> 17:35.766
BACK WITH US AFTER TOO LONG.

17:35.833 --> 17:43.400
AND HE'S CO-FOUNDER OF THE

17:43.466 --> 17:43.900
STRATEGIES AND AN MSNBC

17:43.966 --> 17:46.433
CONTRIBUTOR: STEVE SCHMIDT.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.533
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A BIG DEAL

17:47.600 --> 17:49.933
ABOUT THIS, THIS IS MY DAYS

17:50.000 --> 17:51.133
WAITING FOR A SOLAR CALENDAR --

17:51.200 --> 17:52.533
IS CHILLED A PICTURE OF MY SHED,

17:52.600 --> 17:54.166
THIS TOOK THREE YEARS TO BUILD,

17:54.233 --> 17:55.000
THREE YEARS TO GET THE PERMITS

17:55.066 --> 17:58.500
FOR THAT.

17:58.566 --> 18:00.466
I WILL TRY TO HOLD MY ANGER AT

18:00.533 --> 18:01.766
THE ARROGANCE OF THIS STATE AND

18:01.833 --> 18:02.733
JUST GIVE YOU THE FUN FACT THAT

18:02.800 --> 18:04.500
I READ IN THE PAPER THIS WEEK --

18:04.566 --> 18:09.500
WHEN THE VIRUS HIT -- IS THAT

18:09.566 --> 18:10.666
HOW YOU PRONOUNCE THE CITY IN

18:10.733 --> 18:11.000
CHINA?

18:11.066 --> 18:15.600
THIS WAS SOON AFTER IT WAS IN

18:15.666 --> 18:16.166
WUHAN, CHINA ERECTED ENTIRE

18:16.233 --> 18:18.366
TOWNS OF PREFAB HOUSING AND IT

18:18.433 --> 18:20.800
STARTED THE NEXT MORNING.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.366
I'M NOT SAYING WE ARE A

18:22.433 --> 18:23.033
DICTATORSHIP THAT CAN MOVE THAT

18:23.100 --> 18:26.800
FAST BUT ENTIRE TOWNS TO

18:26.866 --> 18:28.400
QUARANTINE PEOPLE, THREE YEARS

18:28.466 --> 18:33.033
FOR THAT SHIT.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.500
SO, I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS

18:34.566 --> 18:36.233
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE ALL OF OUR

18:36.300 --> 18:41.866
WOUNDS EXCEPT FOR 9/11 WHICH

18:41.933 --> 18:43.100
REALLY WASN'T MOSTLY OUR FAULT

18:43.166 --> 18:46.366
SEEM TO BE SELF-INFLICTED, WHEN

18:46.433 --> 18:46.966
YOU THINK ABOUT ELECTING TRUMP

18:47.033 --> 18:50.500
AND YOU THINK ABOUT IRAQ WAR AND

18:50.566 --> 18:53.200
YOU THINK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

18:53.266 --> 18:55.066
MELTDOWN OF 2008?

18:55.133 --> 18:56.800
STUFF LIKE THIS.

18:56.866 --> 18:59.500
WE CRIPPLE OURSELVES.

18:59.566 --> 19:02.166
WHAT IS IT ABOUT AMERICA THAT WE

19:02.233 --> 19:03.366
ARE SO INFLICTING OUR OWN WOUNDS

19:03.433 --> 19:06.500
ON OURSELVES?

19:06.566 --> 19:08.700
>> EXCEPT FOR THE SOLAR, THE

19:08.766 --> 19:09.300
OTHER EXAMPLES YOU WILL CITED

19:09.366 --> 19:14.733
WERE IN P REPUBLICAN PRESIDENCI,

19:14.800 --> 19:16.866
IT'S A COMMON THEME -- IT ALWAYS

19:16.933 --> 19:18.433
FEELS IS A DEMOCRAT, OBVIOUSLY

19:18.500 --> 19:19.466
IN A PARTISAN LIBERAL DEMOCRAT,

19:19.533 --> 19:20.666
IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE WE ARE

19:20.733 --> 19:21.866
CLEANING UP THOSE MESSES,

19:21.933 --> 19:23.333
WHETHER IT'S THE IRAQ WAR AND

19:23.400 --> 19:27.133
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS MESS, NOW

19:27.200 --> 19:30.500
THE COVID AND THE DESTRUCTION OF

19:30.566 --> 19:31.733
OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, IT IS

19:31.800 --> 19:33.400
FRUSTRATING THAT ONCE WE START

19:33.466 --> 19:35.266
BRINGING A LITTLE BIT NORMALCY

19:35.333 --> 19:36.500
BACK, REPUBLICANS COME BACK FOR

19:36.566 --> 19:38.900
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE COME BACK

19:38.966 --> 19:39.500
AND ELECT ANOTHER REPUBLICAN.

19:39.566 --> 19:40.766
>> Bill: ARE YOU STILL A

19:40.833 --> 19:41.933
REPUBLICAN?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.600
>> NO, I'M A REGISTERED DEMOCRA

19:44.666 --> 19:44.866
DEMOCRAT.

19:44.933 --> 19:45.333
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

19:45.400 --> 19:46.500
>> Bill: YOU DON'T HAVE TO

19:46.566 --> 19:49.000
ARGUE.

19:49.066 --> 19:50.866
>> I WAS ALWAYS A MODERATE

19:50.933 --> 19:51.466
REPUBLICAN BUT HERE'S WHAT THE

19:51.533 --> 19:54.800
DEAL IS.

19:54.866 --> 19:57.433
WE HAVE A REAL-LIFE AUTOCRATIC

19:57.500 --> 19:58.100
FETISHISTIC MOVEMENT IN THIS

19:58.166 --> 20:00.833
COUNTRY THAT HAS A FLOOR OF 40%.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.700
WE HAVE 140 MEMBERS OF THE

20:03.766 --> 20:05.333
HOUSE, SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE

20:05.400 --> 20:06.433
SENATE ON JANUARY 6TH AFTER A

20:06.500 --> 20:10.066
VIOLENT INSURRECTION TO

20:10.133 --> 20:11.300
DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY TAKES

20:11.366 --> 20:15.266
PLACE, THEY VOTED, THEY STOOD UP

20:15.333 --> 20:18.166
AND VOTED AN ACT OF CONGRESS TO

20:18.233 --> 20:20.066
NULLIFY THE RESULTS OF CERTIFIED

20:20.133 --> 20:21.600
STATE ELECTIONS IN A COUNTRY

20:21.666 --> 20:22.200
WHERE THE STATES CREATED THE

20:22.266 --> 20:24.766
CONGRESS AND THE OTHER WAY

20:24.833 --> 20:25.633
AROUND.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.900
IN DOING SO, ESTABLISHED A NEW

20:27.966 --> 20:30.100
JIM CROW CAUCUS AS THEY SOUGHT

20:30.166 --> 20:31.366
TO WIPE OUT MILLIONS OF BLACK

20:31.433 --> 20:36.000
VOTES JUST BECAUSE TO KEEP INTO

20:36.066 --> 20:39.700
POWER THE PERSON WHO LOST THE

20:39.766 --> 20:40.733
ELECTION, MAKING HIM DICTATOR

20:40.800 --> 20:42.433
AND ENDING THE AMERICAN

20:42.500 --> 20:43.833
REPUBLIC.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.133
THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.333
TO YOUR POINT ON POLITICS -- MY

20:48.400 --> 20:50.300
POLITICS HAS EVOLVED OVER THE

20:50.366 --> 20:51.266
YEARS AND I DON'T NECESSARILY

20:51.333 --> 20:54.066
LOOK AT IT, THOUGH I'M BROADLY

20:54.133 --> 20:56.100
SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR POINT OF

20:56.166 --> 20:57.666
VIEW ON REPUBLICANS IN

20:57.733 --> 20:58.300
PRESIDENCIES AND THE DISASTER, I

20:58.366 --> 21:01.433
THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF BIG

21:01.500 --> 21:04.466
IN THIS COUNTRY.

21:04.533 --> 21:05.100
TO BE BIG?

21:05.166 --> 21:07.433
>> BIG BANKS, BIG TECH, BIG

21:07.500 --> 21:10.100
EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE YOU SEE

21:10.166 --> 21:11.100
BIG, THE LITTLE GUYS GETTING

21:11.166 --> 21:11.366
FUCKED.

21:11.433 --> 21:14.933
>> Bill: AND BIG GOVERNMENT.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.866
I DID HEAR YOU TALK AGAINST BIG

21:16.933 --> 21:17.900
GOVERNMENT FOR A LOT OF YEARS,

21:17.966 --> 21:20.066
YOU COULDN'T HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL

21:20.133 --> 21:20.700
THAT!

21:20.766 --> 21:22.700
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE SOLAR

21:22.766 --> 21:24.266
CALENDAR, WE BUILT THE

21:24.333 --> 21:25.733
GOLDEN STATE BRIDGE AND THE

21:25.800 --> 21:26.700
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING AT ABOUT

21:26.766 --> 21:28.466
NINE MONTHS EACH IN THE 1930s,

21:28.533 --> 21:32.466
IF YOU TRY TO DO THAT TODAY, IT

21:32.533 --> 21:32.900
WOULD TAKE 15 YEARS.

21:32.966 --> 21:33.966
>> Bill: THREE YEARS FOR THIS

21:34.033 --> 21:34.166
SHIT?

21:34.233 --> 21:38.500
IT'S INSANE.

21:38.566 --> 21:39.366
THAT WAS INTERESTING WITH WHAT

21:39.433 --> 21:41.200
YOU JUST SAID, I THINK I AGREE

21:41.266 --> 21:42.966
WITH ALL OF IT, LET ME READ YOU

21:43.033 --> 21:44.900
WHAT JOE BIDEN SAID SIX WEEKS

21:44.966 --> 21:46.100
BEFORE THE ELECTION.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.733
"THE THING THAT WILL

21:47.800 --> 21:48.366
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WITH

21:48.433 --> 21:48.866
DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE

21:48.933 --> 21:51.366
WHITE HOUSE, NOT A JOKE" THAT'S

21:51.433 --> 21:54.833
HIM SAYING NOT A JOKE, NOT ME.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.700
"YOU WILL SEE AN EPIPHANY OCCUR

21:56.766 --> 21:58.333
AMONG MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN

21:58.400 --> 21:58.600
FRIENDS."

21:58.666 --> 22:01.700
HOW IS THAT EPIPHANY GOING?

22:01.766 --> 22:05.166
>> TEN?

22:05.233 --> 22:05.700
YOU HAD ONE OF THEM.

22:05.766 --> 22:10.400
>> Bill: ONE.

22:10.466 --> 22:10.600
OKAY.

22:10.666 --> 22:12.066
THEY DON'T DO AT TIFFANY'S, I

22:12.133 --> 22:13.600
FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH

22:13.666 --> 22:16.533
DEMOCRATS.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.900
ALWAYS HOPING FOR SOMETHING

22:19.966 --> 22:20.466
THAT, IT'S THE CHARLIE BROWN

22:20.533 --> 22:24.500
WITH THE FOOTBALL THING.

22:24.566 --> 22:27.100
THEY NEVER COME AROUND.

22:27.166 --> 22:27.700
SUSAN COLLINS NEVER DOES THE

22:27.766 --> 22:30.766
RIGHT THING.

22:30.833 --> 22:33.333
ROBERT MUELLER FUCKS IT UP.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.766
IF >> BIDEN HAS LEARNED, HE SOUD

22:37.833 --> 22:39.700
LIKE PEOPLE LIKE ME FOR THE LAST

22:39.766 --> 22:40.633
TEN YEARS, MOST DEMOCRATS

22:40.700 --> 22:42.333
INCLUDING BARACK OBAMA CAME IN

22:42.400 --> 22:44.333
AND THEY DEFINED BIPARTISANSHIP

22:44.400 --> 22:45.433
IS WORKING WITH MITCH

22:45.500 --> 22:46.566
McCONNELL AND MITCH

22:46.633 --> 22:47.133
McCONNELL COULD DENY THOSE

22:47.200 --> 22:51.666
VOTES AND DENY THE

22:51.733 --> 22:52.166
BIPARTISANSHIP.

22:52.233 --> 22:52.766
WHAT JOE BIDEN HAS COME IN AND

22:52.833 --> 22:55.133
SAID, IT'S NOT ABOUT MACCONNELL

22:55.200 --> 22:57.700
OR ANY OF THOSE OTHER

22:57.766 --> 22:58.666
REPUBLICANS, IT'S ABOUT THE

22:58.733 --> 23:00.366
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

23:00.433 --> 23:00.933
THE COVID RELIEF ACT THAT'S

23:01.000 --> 23:02.433
GOING THROUGH CONGRESS RIGHT NOW

23:02.500 --> 23:05.833
HAS APPROVAL RATING OF 86%, THAT

23:05.900 --> 23:07.733
INCLUDES REPUBLICANS AND

23:07.800 --> 23:13.833
INDEPENDENTS, THAT IS TRUE

23:13.900 --> 23:14.300
PARTISANSHIP, F MITCH

23:14.366 --> 23:14.566
McCONNELL.

23:14.633 --> 23:18.200
>> Bill: 80% IS THE HIGH

23:18.266 --> 23:18.433
NUMBER?

23:18.500 --> 23:19.433
DO YOU THINK THEY DID THE

23:19.500 --> 23:20.633
IMPEACHMENT THE RIGHT WAY?

23:20.700 --> 23:22.200
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING DOWN A FOOLS

23:22.266 --> 23:24.500
PATH WHEN YOU TRY TO LINK

23:24.566 --> 23:25.933
RHETORIC -- UNLESS IT'S REALLY

23:26.000 --> 23:28.400
EXPLICIT -- WITH ACTIONS.

23:28.466 --> 23:31.033
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT THE

23:31.100 --> 23:32.300
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING THE CASE

23:32.366 --> 23:33.500
FOR TODAY, IT'S A TERRIBLE CASE

23:33.566 --> 23:37.300
AND OF COURSE HE IS A CRIMINAL.

23:37.366 --> 23:37.933
BUT THE CRIME WAS DENYING THAT

23:38.000 --> 23:40.433
HE LOST THE ELECTION.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.900
I FEEL LIKE MAKING IT ABOUT THE

23:43.966 --> 23:47.633
RIOT WAS SORT OF A DISTRACTION.

23:47.700 --> 23:48.833
YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE SIMILAR

23:48.900 --> 23:50.233
CASES AND THAT'S WHAT

23:50.300 --> 23:51.466
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING -- ALL

23:51.533 --> 23:53.033
WEEK LONG COME ALL DAY SHOW WAS

23:53.100 --> 23:55.633
THE ONE TIME HE SAID IN HIS

23:55.700 --> 23:58.733
SPEECH ON JANUARY 6 THE WORD

23:58.800 --> 24:00.033
"PEACEFUL."

24:00.100 --> 24:00.700
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A REALLY HARD

24:00.766 --> 24:02.466
CASE TO MAKE IT, WHEREAS THEY

24:02.533 --> 24:04.200
HAD A TAPE OF HIM WITH THE GUY

24:04.266 --> 24:08.733
FROM GEORGIA SAYING "FIND ME

24:08.800 --> 24:10.600
11,000 NEW VOTES."

24:10.666 --> 24:12.266
THEY HAD HIS VOICE ON TAPE!

24:12.333 --> 24:13.333
THAT TO ME WOULD'VE BEEN A

24:13.400 --> 24:16.400
BETTER -- IF YOU WANT TO TRY HIM

24:16.466 --> 24:17.300
AGAIN, I WOULD HAVE RATHER SEEN

24:17.366 --> 24:19.466
THE REPUBLICANS DEFEND THAT.

24:19.533 --> 24:21.933
THE GUY ON TAPE SAYING "FIND ME

24:22.000 --> 24:22.966
11,000 NEW VOTES, AND I CAN WIN

24:23.033 --> 24:24.800
THIS THING."

24:24.866 --> 24:26.066
I CAN'T THINK OF THE MORE

24:26.133 --> 24:30.233
SMOKING GUN THAN THAT.

24:30.300 --> 24:33.500
>> THESE MONTHS THAT TOOK PLACE

24:33.566 --> 24:34.000
BETWEEN ELECTION DAY AND

24:34.066 --> 24:35.133
INAUGURATION DAY ARE SOME OF THE

24:35.200 --> 24:37.666
MOST SIGNIFICANT MONTHS IN THE

24:37.733 --> 24:38.066
NATION'S HISTORY.

24:38.133 --> 24:40.066
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN

24:40.133 --> 24:40.766
ELECTION DAY AND THE SIXTH IS

24:40.833 --> 24:44.400
FAITH AND BELIEF THAT AMERICAN

24:44.466 --> 24:47.033
DEMOCRACY WAS POISONED,

24:47.100 --> 24:47.900
PREMEDITATED AND DELIBERATELY,

24:47.966 --> 24:50.100
BY THE PRESIDENT, BY THE CYNICAL

24:50.166 --> 24:51.833
ELITES LIKE JOSH HAWLEY AND TED

24:51.900 --> 24:53.500
CRUZ, THE PAID LIARS LIKE SEAN

24:53.566 --> 24:54.233
HANNITY AND LAURA INGRAHAM, THEY

24:54.300 --> 24:58.066
POISONED IT.

24:58.133 --> 25:01.766
DAY BY DAY, LIKE AN EXXON

25:01.833 --> 25:04.500
VALDEZ, LIKE A BP DEEPWATER

25:04.566 --> 25:06.666
HORIZON, THE NUMBERS ROSE UNTIL

25:06.733 --> 25:07.866
82% OF REPUBLICANS SAID "THE

25:07.933 --> 25:10.600
FAIREST AND FREEST ELECTION IN

25:10.666 --> 25:12.333
AMERICAN HISTORY WAS STOLEN."

25:12.400 --> 25:13.633
WE'VE INVENTED A LOT OF GREAT

25:13.700 --> 25:15.500
THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY,

25:15.566 --> 25:17.466
AIRPLANES, iPHONES, SHIPS THAT

25:17.533 --> 25:19.166
CAN LAND ON THE MOON AND RETURN,

25:19.233 --> 25:21.600
PENICILLIN, I SAY THAT FOR

25:21.666 --> 25:26.266
TRUMP.

25:26.333 --> 25:26.533
[LAUGHTER]

25:26.600 --> 25:27.000
ALL OF THESE THINGS --

25:27.066 --> 25:29.433
>> Bill: WEIGHT.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.866
>> THE GREATEST THING WE EVER

25:30.933 --> 25:33.133
INVENTED IN THIS COUNTRY BARN ON

25:33.200 --> 25:35.833
IS THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF

25:35.900 --> 25:37.733
POWER THAT WAS UNINTERRUPTED

25:37.800 --> 25:39.866
FROM 1797 UNTIL 2021.

25:39.933 --> 25:40.400
>> Bill: AND SEPARATION OF

25:40.466 --> 25:41.866
POWER.

25:41.933 --> 25:45.066
>> AND THAT ENDED, THIS PROCESS

25:45.133 --> 25:46.666
WAS BLOOD-SOAKED IN THE

25:46.733 --> 25:47.666
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

25:47.733 --> 25:49.966
BECAUSE OF THE INCITEMENT TO

25:50.033 --> 25:53.000
VIOLENCE AND INSURRECTION OF

25:53.066 --> 25:55.233
DONALD TRUMP.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.366
[APPLAUSE]

25:56.433 --> 25:57.600
AND THE REALITY IS, THE MORE

25:57.666 --> 26:00.200
CLEAR IT WAS, THE MORE CERTAIN

26:00.266 --> 26:02.800
THE OUTCOME OF THAT TRIAL WAS,

26:02.866 --> 26:04.633
THE GREATER THE NECESSITY, THE

26:04.700 --> 26:09.100
GREATER THE MORAL NECESSITY FOR

26:09.166 --> 26:09.433
TAKING PLACE.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.066
BECAUSE WHAT WILL BE CARVED FOR

26:11.133 --> 26:14.466
THE AGES INTO THE GRANITE OF THE

26:14.533 --> 26:16.166
STORY OF AMERICA WHERE THE MEN

26:16.233 --> 26:19.066
AND WOMEN WHO BETRAYED THEIR

26:19.133 --> 26:21.233
OATH'S, BETRAYED THEIR JUROR

26:21.300 --> 26:23.200
OATH'S, BETRAYED THEIR COUNTRY,

26:23.266 --> 26:24.633
AND ALLOWING A PRESIDENT WHO

26:24.700 --> 26:26.366
SOUGHT TO BE A DICTATOR WALKED

26:26.433 --> 26:29.066
OUT AND MAKE NO MISTAKE:

26:29.133 --> 26:31.066
DONALD TRUMP RUNS THE REPUBLICAN

26:31.133 --> 26:32.533
PARTY, THAT PARTY IS AN

26:32.600 --> 26:35.433
AUTOCRATIC PARTY.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.633
I LOVE CONGRESSMAN ADAM

26:36.700 --> 26:38.033
KINZINGER'S COURAGE IN STANDING

26:38.100 --> 26:40.566
UP, A REQUIREMENT TO BE IN

26:40.633 --> 26:43.466
CONGRESS OUGHT TO BE THE

26:43.533 --> 26:44.100
WILLINGNESS, DEMOCRAT OR

26:44.166 --> 26:45.533
REPUBLICAN: TO LAY DOWN YOUR

26:45.600 --> 26:46.633
SEAT ON A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE

26:46.700 --> 26:49.666
BUT HE IS IN THE MINORITY.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.100
THE AUTOCRATS IN THAT CAUCUS ARE

26:51.166 --> 26:54.366
IN THE MAJORITY AND ANY TIME YOU

26:54.433 --> 26:55.500
HAVE A COALITION OF CONVENIENCE

26:55.566 --> 26:57.433
BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES AND

26:57.500 --> 26:58.366
FASCISTS, IT IS ALWAYS THE

26:58.433 --> 27:01.766
FASCISTS WHO WIN.

27:01.833 --> 27:02.500
THE FIRST THING THEY DO WHEN

27:02.566 --> 27:06.066
THEY WIN IS DISPATCH THE NAIVE

27:06.133 --> 27:06.666
CONSERVATIVES WHO IN COALITION

27:06.733 --> 27:08.766
HELP BRING THEM TO POWER.

27:08.833 --> 27:12.366
THE IDEA THAT IN 2020, YOU VOTE

27:12.433 --> 27:14.500
FOR DONALD TRUMP AFTER HE HAS

27:14.566 --> 27:16.733
THE BLOOD OF HUNDREDS OF

27:16.800 --> 27:18.000
THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS ON HIS

27:18.066 --> 27:19.100
HANDS FROM HIS LYING, HIS

27:19.166 --> 27:22.600
POISONING OF OUR DEMOCRACY?

27:22.666 --> 27:23.033
IT IS INEXPLICABLE.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.900
INEXPLICABLE TO ME.

27:25.966 --> 27:26.500
>> Narrator: >> Bill: THAT'S

27:26.566 --> 27:31.366
WHAT ADAM KINZINGER DID.

27:31.433 --> 27:37.000
>> IT'S UTTERLY INEXPLICABLE.

27:37.066 --> 27:38.266
>> Bill: YOU'RE SAYING THE

27:38.333 --> 27:39.266
PARTY IS BEYOND REDEMPTION.

27:39.333 --> 27:43.233
>> THERE IS NO PLACE TO ME IN

27:43.300 --> 27:44.700
THE MIDDLE WITH FASCISTS AND

27:44.766 --> 27:47.233
WHITE SUPREMACIST, THEY MUST BE

27:47.300 --> 27:48.066
BROUGHT TO SUBMISSION,

27:48.133 --> 27:48.366
ELECTORALLY.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.366
>> Bill: SAY WE COULD

27:49.433 --> 27:51.066
MAGICALLY WIPE OUT THE TRUNK

27:51.133 --> 27:53.666
PARTY, WE CAN'T HAVE JUST THE

27:53.733 --> 27:54.366
DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE THAT'S

27:54.433 --> 27:55.866
WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND I

27:55.933 --> 27:57.500
CAN'T GET MY SOUL ARE TURNED ON,

27:57.566 --> 27:58.600
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

27:58.666 --> 27:59.966
IF WE DO NEED A LOYAL

28:00.033 --> 28:01.166
OPPOSITION, WE USED TO HAVE A

28:01.233 --> 28:03.833
SANE ONE.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.600
>> WE DO, I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT

28:05.666 --> 28:06.233
AND I LOATHE EVERYTHING

28:06.300 --> 28:07.533
REPUBLICANS STAND FOR AND I

28:07.600 --> 28:09.300
REMEMBER THE TIMES WHEN

28:09.366 --> 28:12.433
JOHN McCAIN WAS THE DEVIL AND

28:12.500 --> 28:12.933
MITT ROMNEY, HOLY SHIT!

28:13.000 --> 28:14.066
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO TO

28:14.133 --> 28:15.233
AMERICA?

28:15.300 --> 28:15.933
BUT THERE WAS NEVER THE SENSE

28:16.000 --> 28:17.866
THAT IF WE HAVE A LOW TURNOUT

28:17.933 --> 28:19.166
ELECTION THAT WE ARE GOING TO

28:19.233 --> 28:19.833
LOSE OUR DEMOCRACY AND THAT'S

28:19.900 --> 28:24.066
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

28:24.133 --> 28:26.600
THE NEXT FASCISTS REPUBLICANS

28:26.666 --> 28:29.866
NOMINATE IS GOING TO BE' BE

28:29.933 --> 28:30.833
SMARTER THAN DONALD TRUMP --

28:30.900 --> 28:32.400
DONALD TRUMP IS A FUCKING MORON,

28:32.466 --> 28:33.266
HE ANNOUNCED HIS PLANS TO

28:33.333 --> 28:33.533
EVERYBODY.

28:33.600 --> 28:37.300
I'M GOING TO DESTROY THE POSTAL

28:37.366 --> 28:39.133
SERVICE -- IT WAS EASY, HE

28:39.200 --> 28:42.633
ANNOUNCED ALL THESE.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.966
YOU GET A VLADIMIR PUTIN LIKE

28:45.033 --> 28:47.233
CHARACTER AND WE ARE IN TROUBLE.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.266
>> Bill: TED CRUZ, JOSH

28:48.333 --> 28:50.266
HAWLEY, GUYS WHO ARE A LOT MORE

28:50.333 --> 28:51.233
SHREWD THAN DONALD TRUMP.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.566
>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONFUSED BY

28:52.633 --> 28:53.800
THIS AND I THINK THIS IS PART OF

28:53.866 --> 29:01.066
THE DESIGN FLAW PROGRE PROGRESS,

29:01.133 --> 29:01.400
RESPECTIVELY.

29:01.466 --> 29:03.266
THERE IS LITERALLY NO PERSON IN

29:03.333 --> 29:06.066
AMERICA WHO GOES INTO DRIVER'S

29:06.133 --> 29:06.666
LICENSE, SOCIAL SECURITY CARD,

29:06.733 --> 29:07.566
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO WALKS INTO

29:07.633 --> 29:08.933
THAT BUILDING AND WALKS OUT AND

29:09.000 --> 29:10.600
SAY I WANT TO PUT THESE PEOPLE I

29:10.666 --> 29:12.100
JUST INTERACTED AND IN CHARGE OF

29:12.166 --> 29:12.866
MORE STUFF HAVING TO DO WITH MY

29:12.933 --> 29:13.700
LIFE AND GIVE THEM MORE MONEY TO

29:13.766 --> 29:16.966
DO WITH IT.

29:17.033 --> 29:18.600
IF YOU WANT GOVERNMENT TO

29:18.666 --> 29:21.700
DELIVER SERVICES, AND WE DO NEED

29:21.766 --> 29:23.233
GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER SERVICES,

29:23.300 --> 29:24.666
WE SHOULD ALL DEMAND AS

29:24.733 --> 29:26.333
TAXPAYERS THAT THOSE SERVICES BE

29:26.400 --> 29:28.233
DELIVERED WITH RUTHLESS

29:28.300 --> 29:31.033
EFFICIENCY.

29:31.100 --> 29:31.300
[APPLAUSE]

29:31.366 --> 29:33.700
IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN

29:33.766 --> 29:34.633
ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAM THAT SPENDS

29:34.700 --> 29:35.366
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR POOR

29:35.433 --> 29:38.666
KIDS, WE BETTER MAKE IT WORK.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.633
WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY, WE NEED

29:40.700 --> 29:41.100
METRICS, WE NEED SMART

29:41.166 --> 29:42.833
GOVERNMENT AND THERE IS THIS

29:42.900 --> 29:44.866
IDEA THAT I THINK PERVADES

29:44.933 --> 29:46.666
WASHINGTON THAT IT IS INHERENTLY

29:46.733 --> 29:48.266
DEFENSIVE TO SAY BECAUSE

29:48.333 --> 29:49.233
SOMETHING COSTS A LOT, THERE IS

29:49.300 --> 29:51.966
INJURY BY SAYING IT DOESN'T WORK

29:52.033 --> 29:55.333
PARTICULARLY WELL.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.200
THE MORE PROGRESSIVE YOU ARE,

29:57.266 --> 29:58.833
THE GREATER THE DEMAND FOR

29:58.900 --> 30:00.066
EFFICIENCY SHOULD BE.

30:00.133 --> 30:00.633
>> Bill: I KEEP SAYING THIS

30:00.700 --> 30:02.266
BUT A LOT OF THIS IS COMPETENCE,

30:02.333 --> 30:04.733
WE WANT TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE

30:04.800 --> 30:11.266
CAPITAL RIOT IF THEY HAD DARTED

30:11.333 --> 30:11.666
THE CAPITOL.

30:11.733 --> 30:13.833
THESE GUYS WHO GOT IN MUST BE

30:13.900 --> 30:15.400
LIKE THE DOG WHO CAUGHT THE CAR,

30:15.466 --> 30:17.466
THEY'RE LIKE WE ARE IN THE

30:17.533 --> 30:17.733
BUILDING?

30:17.800 --> 30:19.066
THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE

30:19.133 --> 30:19.866
GOING TO GET IN.

30:19.933 --> 30:22.200
THEY TALKED ABOUT WHAT IF THEY

30:22.266 --> 30:23.400
HAD GOTTEN ROMNEY, WHAT IF THEY

30:23.466 --> 30:25.066
HAD GOTTEN PELOSI, WHAT IF THEY

30:25.133 --> 30:27.233
DIDN'T GET IN AT ALL?

30:27.300 --> 30:28.666
>> I THINK THE MOST AMAZING

30:28.733 --> 30:30.033
THING ABOUT THE WHOLE THING IS

30:30.100 --> 30:31.233
WATCHING THE VIDEO AND ON THE

30:31.300 --> 30:33.033
SENATE FLOOR, THERE'S A COP WHO

30:33.100 --> 30:36.066
IS ARMED AND A GUY BURSTS IN,

30:36.133 --> 30:39.700
THE QANON SHAMAN DRESSED LIKE A

30:39.766 --> 30:41.833
VIKING AND HE BASICALLY TALKS TO

30:41.900 --> 30:43.400
HIM.

30:43.466 --> 30:45.333
I'M WATCHING -- SHOOT HIM!

30:45.400 --> 30:48.066
SHOOT HIM!

30:48.133 --> 30:48.666
YOU BURST INTO THE

30:48.733 --> 30:50.633
UNITED STATES, IF HE WAS DRESSED

30:50.700 --> 30:51.333
LIKE BIN LADEN, WHAT YOU HAVE

30:51.400 --> 30:54.166
SHOT HIM?

30:54.233 --> 30:55.766
>> YOU TALK ABOUT COMPETENCE,

30:55.833 --> 30:59.000
THAT'S A HUMAN NATURE THING.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.366
ANYBODY TALKING TO COMCAST HAVE

31:00.433 --> 31:01.400
A REALLY GOOD?

31:01.466 --> 31:02.166
YOU COULD GO DOWN THE LIST OF

31:02.233 --> 31:04.600
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

31:04.666 --> 31:05.966
YOU HAVE A BIG INSTITUTION, YOU

31:06.033 --> 31:06.566
HAVE ISSUES LIKE THAT BUT ARE

31:06.633 --> 31:10.700
YOU GOING TO DOUBT THAT FAUCI

31:10.766 --> 31:12.666
AND THE CDC RIGHT NOW IS NOT A

31:12.733 --> 31:16.033
MILLION TIMES MORE COMPETENT

31:16.100 --> 31:17.500
UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION?

31:17.566 --> 31:18.766
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.333
>> Bill: I'M GLAD YOU

31:20.400 --> 31:21.233
MENTIONED THE SHAMAN BECAUSE HE

31:21.300 --> 31:24.333
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS,

31:24.400 --> 31:25.866
HE HAS RENOUNCED TRUMP -- A LOT

31:25.933 --> 31:26.900
OF THESE INSURRECTIONIST'S --

31:26.966 --> 31:27.633
IT'S TRUE.

31:27.700 --> 31:28.700
YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF HIM, HE IS

31:28.766 --> 31:31.800
TO LOOK REALLY COOL.

31:31.866 --> 31:33.533
THAT IS COOL, THAT IS A COOL

31:33.600 --> 31:34.633
LOOK.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.166
LOOK WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE NOW.

31:36.233 --> 31:36.700
I THINK HE WAS WAY BETTER

31:36.766 --> 31:40.866
WEARING THE PELT.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.666
NOW HE LOOKS LIKE SOME ASSHOLE

31:43.733 --> 31:44.266
TELLING YOU HOW HE BRUISE HIS

31:44.333 --> 31:48.033
OWN BEER.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.500
WHEN HE WAS HOT WITH THE SHAMAN

31:49.566 --> 31:51.300
THING, I MUST SAY I KIND OF FELL

31:51.366 --> 31:54.233
FOR HIM.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.433
HE WAS HOT THERE IN THE SHAMAN

31:56.500 --> 31:58.666
WORLD, HE OPENED SHAMAN WHERE

31:58.733 --> 31:59.466
FOR MEN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

31:59.533 --> 32:03.200
KNOW ABOUT THAT AND I SENT

32:03.266 --> 32:04.566
AWAY -- GO [APPLAUSE]

32:04.633 --> 32:07.233
YOU CAN SEND AWAY ON AMAZON AND

32:07.300 --> 32:08.600
WHEN YOU SEND AWAY FOR THE KNOCK

32:08.666 --> 32:12.700
OFF STUFF, GOT THIS.

32:12.766 --> 32:17.700
IT'S NOT REALLY, AND I GOT THE

32:17.766 --> 32:21.633
SPEAR.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.133
I GOT THE SPEAR TOO.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.366
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

32:25.433 --> 32:28.666
IS NOT AS GOOD -- IT'S LIKE THE

32:28.733 --> 32:30.666
BEATLES WIG OF SHAMAN WHERE, YOU

32:30.733 --> 32:32.233
DON'T REALLY LOOK LIKE THE

32:32.300 --> 32:32.466
BEATLES.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.366
HE SAID HE WAS WRONG ABOUT TRUMP

32:35.433 --> 32:37.966
WE GOT TO THEM, I SAID WHAT ELSE

32:38.033 --> 32:38.966
WE ARE WRONG ABOUT?

32:39.033 --> 32:39.900
WE GOT A LIST, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

32:39.966 --> 32:42.466
HEAR WHAT ELSE HE WAS WRONG

32:42.533 --> 32:46.600
ABOUT?

32:46.666 --> 32:48.800
HE SAID "I WAS WRONG TO THINK

32:48.866 --> 32:50.600
YOU CAN MIKE ROWE DOSE SALTS."

32:50.666 --> 32:53.166
HE ADMITTED IT.

32:53.233 --> 32:59.600
IF HE SAID I WAS WRONG WHEN THEY

32:59.666 --> 33:00.766
TOLD ME THE INSURRECTION WAS

33:00.833 --> 33:02.366
COSTUME ONLY.

33:02.433 --> 33:03.766
I WAS WRONG TO USE GORILLA GLUE

33:03.833 --> 33:04.366
TO KEEP THE VIKING HAT ON MY

33:04.433 --> 33:05.200
HEAD.

33:05.266 --> 33:06.733
I WAS WRONG TO THINK THE WAY TO

33:06.800 --> 33:07.966
GET RESPECT IN PRISON IS TO TALK

33:08.033 --> 33:12.033
ABOUT YOUR ALLERGIES.

33:12.100 --> 33:12.300
[LAUGHTER]

33:12.366 --> 33:13.333
I WAS WRONG TO SAY ALL THOSE

33:13.400 --> 33:14.133
THINGS ABOUT JEWS BEFORE I

33:14.200 --> 33:20.866
NEEDED A LAWYER.

33:20.933 --> 33:23.433
ALL RIGHT.

33:41.433 --> 33:42.333
GEORGIA SENATE ELECTION, WHICH

33:42.400 --> 33:45.733
WAS THE CRUCIAL ONE -- I CAN'T

33:45.800 --> 33:49.366
BELIEVE THIS NUMBER, IT COST

33:49.433 --> 33:50.000
$833 BILLION, THAT'S ALMOST WHAT

THE ENTIRE NATIONAL ELECTION IN

34:24.833 --> 34:27.233
TERRITORY -- I DON'T KNOW.

34:27.300 --> 34:31.400
I LIKED THE ADS.

34:31.466 --> 34:34.666
>> LOOK, I THINK WE BUILT THE

34:34.733 --> 34:36.166
MOST SUCCESSFUL SUPER PAC IN

34:36.233 --> 34:37.466
AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY, WE

34:37.533 --> 34:38.533
TURNED IT INTO A MOVEMENT AND I

34:38.600 --> 34:39.866
THINK WE GET TREMENDOUS DAMAGE

34:39.933 --> 34:42.600
TO DONALD TRUMP.

34:42.666 --> 34:42.866
[APPLAUSE]

34:42.933 --> 34:45.466
I THINK WE TOOK THE FIGHT TO

34:45.533 --> 34:45.666
HIM.

34:45.733 --> 34:47.366
>> Bill: IF THAT'S TRUE, WHY

34:47.433 --> 34:48.700
DID HE DO SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS

34:48.766 --> 34:52.666
BETTER WITH REPUBLICANS?

34:52.733 --> 34:53.733
HE GOT 94% OF REPUBLICAN VOTES

34:53.800 --> 34:59.400
AND 88% THE FIRST TIME --

34:59.466 --> 35:00.666
>> I THINK SOMETIMES YOU SAY

35:00.733 --> 35:02.333
THINGS AT THE BEGINNING AND THEY

35:02.400 --> 35:04.266
TAKE ON THE ORDER OF GOSPEL.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.833
WE WERE TRYING TO WIN THE

35:05.900 --> 35:06.900
ELECTION, I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT

35:06.966 --> 35:08.000
HOW MANY REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR

35:08.066 --> 35:09.433
TRUMP OR NOT.

35:09.500 --> 35:13.666
AT THE END OF THE DAY ONE OF THE

35:13.733 --> 35:14.300
DETERMINANT GROUPS WHICH ARE

35:14.366 --> 35:15.033
CONCENTRATION WAS MOST ACUTE ON

35:15.100 --> 35:15.933
WAS INDEPENDENT WHITE MEN AND IF

35:16.000 --> 35:18.933
YOU LOOK AT THE DELTA BETWEEN

35:19.000 --> 35:22.033
THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR BIDEN

35:22.100 --> 35:24.033
AND TURN DOWN TICKET FOR

35:24.100 --> 35:24.833
REPUBLICANS, WE PLAYED VERY

35:24.900 --> 35:26.633
HEAVILY IN THAT SPACE.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.733
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M PROUD

35:28.800 --> 35:31.466
OF THE FACT THAT WE DESTROYED

35:31.533 --> 35:32.633
DONALD TRUMP'S AND MIKE PENCE'S

35:32.700 --> 35:37.066
RELATIONSHIP AND TOOK MIKE PENCE

35:37.133 --> 35:38.433
OUT OF PUBLIC LIFE, AND PART OF

35:38.500 --> 35:39.800
THE FACT THAT WE DECAPITATED HIS

35:39.866 --> 35:41.066
CAMPAIGN MANAGER FROM THE

35:41.133 --> 35:43.066
CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF OUR ADS.

35:43.133 --> 35:45.066
WHEN DONALD TRUMP WENT OUT IN

35:45.133 --> 35:47.266
TULSA, HE TALKED ABOUT FOR

35:47.333 --> 35:50.066
45 MINUTES WALKING DOWN A RAMP

35:50.133 --> 35:51.266
AND DRINKING WATER AND ACTING

35:51.333 --> 35:52.066
INSANE.

35:52.133 --> 35:53.033
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE

35:53.100 --> 35:55.200
HELPED LEAD A BOYCOTT OF

35:55.266 --> 35:58.000
CORPORATE AMERICA FOR THOSE 147

35:58.066 --> 35:58.966
SEDITION NESTS, MICROSOFT SAYING

35:59.033 --> 36:01.633
"WE AREN'T GOING TO GIVE HIM ANY

36:01.700 --> 36:01.933
MORE MONEY."

36:02.000 --> 36:05.300
I THINK THERE IS $200 MILLION OF

36:05.366 --> 36:07.066
CASH THAT CORPORATE AMERICA IS

36:07.133 --> 36:09.966
LIKELY TO TAKE OUT OF REPUBLICAN

36:10.033 --> 36:11.666
ORGANIZATIONS ON THE BASIS OF

36:11.733 --> 36:13.400
THE VOTE THAT DISENFRANCHISE

36:13.466 --> 36:14.200
MILLIONS OF BLACK VOTES BECAUSE

36:14.266 --> 36:17.233
EVERY SINGLE COMPANY IN AMERICA

36:17.300 --> 36:18.500
HAS MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT

36:18.566 --> 36:20.600
RACIAL JUSTICE.

36:20.666 --> 36:22.700
EVERY COMPANY IN AMERICA HAS

36:22.766 --> 36:23.866
BLACK EMPLOYEES AND BLACK

36:23.933 --> 36:28.200
CUSTOMERS AND THEY CAN'T EVER

36:28.266 --> 36:30.200
SAY "I'M PRO BLACK LIVES MATTER

36:30.266 --> 36:31.000
BUT I'M ALSO FOR

36:31.066 --> 36:31.966
DISENFRANCHISING MY BLACK

36:32.033 --> 36:32.400
VOTES."

36:32.466 --> 36:34.466
ONE OF THE THINGS HAPPENING IN

36:34.533 --> 36:37.633
THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AS WE

36:37.700 --> 36:39.266
SPEAK IS A MASSIVE

36:39.333 --> 36:40.400
DISENFRANCHISEMENT LEGISLATIVE

36:40.466 --> 36:41.700
EFFORT THAT SEEKS TO PULL AS

36:41.766 --> 36:45.433
MANY VOTES OUT OF THE SYSTEM

36:45.500 --> 36:46.033
BEFORE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES CAN

36:46.100 --> 36:49.033
PUT MORE VOTERS INTO IT TO MAKE

36:49.100 --> 36:50.700
CERTAIN THAT THE REPUBLICANS CAN

36:50.766 --> 36:51.433
GET BACK INTO POWER ON A

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
MINORITY BASIS.

36:53.566 --> 36:58.433
WE HAVE A REAL LIFE, AND 2021,

36:58.500 --> 36:59.166
JIM CROW MOVEMENT THAT IS

36:59.233 --> 37:02.333
PLAYING OUT IN REPUBLICAN

37:02.400 --> 37:02.933
LEGISLATIVE STATES TO DENY THE

37:03.000 --> 37:04.766
RIGHT TO VOTE.

37:04.833 --> 37:07.566
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF

37:07.633 --> 37:09.033
WHAT THE LINCOLN PROJECT, WITH

37:09.100 --> 37:11.200
THE LINCOLN PROJECT DID IN THE

37:11.266 --> 37:11.733
SELECTION, WE ACCUMULATED

37:11.800 --> 37:15.033
BILLIONS OF VIEWS.

37:15.100 --> 37:15.633
WE HAVE MORE FOLLOWERS ONLINE

37:15.700 --> 37:19.566
THAN THE RNC DID.

37:19.633 --> 37:21.633
WE BUILT STREAMING SERVICES AND

37:21.700 --> 37:22.033
PODCAST SERVICES.

37:22.100 --> 37:22.900
>> Bill: AT ALL THE MONEY WENT

37:22.966 --> 37:26.233
TOWARDS WHERE IT SHOULD?

37:26.300 --> 37:28.633
>> OUT OF $87 MILLION THAT WAS

37:28.700 --> 37:30.833
RAISED BY THE LINCOLN PROJECT,

37:30.900 --> 37:34.466
ABOUT 63 TO 66000000 OF THAT

37:34.533 --> 37:37.633
MONEY WENT TO VOTER CONTACT,

37:37.700 --> 37:41.500
INTO VOTER CONTACT PROGRAMS.

37:41.566 --> 37:44.766
CAMPAIGNS COST A LOT OF MONEY.

37:44.833 --> 37:48.266
ALL OF THIS STUFF, EVERY

37:48.333 --> 37:48.900
SUPER PAC OPERATES LIKE THIS IN

37:49.000 --> 37:52.766
THE LINCOLN PROJECT DID IT FOR

37:52.833 --> 37:54.466
THIS REASON.

37:54.533 --> 37:55.533
>> Bill: WORD OF THE OTHER

37:55.600 --> 37:56.400
MONEY GO?

37:56.466 --> 37:58.033
>> THE LAW REQUIRES YOU MAKE

37:58.100 --> 38:00.500
DISCLOSURES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE

38:00.566 --> 38:01.033
TO DISCLOSE SUBCONTRACTOR

38:01.100 --> 38:03.166
PAYMENTS WHICH IS HOW YOU

38:03.233 --> 38:04.966
PROTECT YOUR STAFF AND ALL SORTS

38:05.033 --> 38:05.566
OF VENDORS FROM THE HARASSMENT

38:05.633 --> 38:08.266
OF THE TRUMP PEOPLE.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.400
I'M A GUY WHO HAD FBI AGENTS

38:10.466 --> 38:15.066
SHOW UP AT HIS HOUSE TO SAY YOUR

38:15.133 --> 38:16.633
NUMBER 11 ON THE TRUMP HIT LIST.

38:16.700 --> 38:17.766
>> Bill: I WAS EIGHT.

38:17.833 --> 38:20.733
>> YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST

38:20.800 --> 38:23.066
BATCH, I MADE A BET IN THE NEXT

38:23.133 --> 38:24.433
BATCH.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.633
WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE,

38:26.700 --> 38:28.033
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS BUT WE

38:28.100 --> 38:33.066
SPENT 75-80% OF TOTAL MONEY ON

38:33.133 --> 38:33.400
VOTER CONTACT.

38:33.466 --> 38:34.833
>> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP

38:34.900 --> 38:38.200
GEORGIA, IT'S AN INSTRUCTIVE

38:38.266 --> 38:39.033
CASE.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.833
GENERALLY SPEAKING, MOST BUT NOT

38:40.900 --> 38:42.900
ALL OF TELEVISION ADS WAS PISSED

38:42.966 --> 38:44.800
AWAY MONEY, NONE OF IT CHANGED A

38:44.866 --> 38:46.133
SINGLE PERSON'S MIND AT THE

38:46.200 --> 38:46.933
PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, WHO WAS

38:47.000 --> 38:48.533
GOING TO SEE AN AD THAT'S GOING

38:48.600 --> 38:52.033
I WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP?

38:52.100 --> 38:53.500
>> Bill: THAT'S WHY I STOPPED

38:53.566 --> 38:54.200
GIVING.

38:54.266 --> 38:57.433
>> HERE'S AN INTERESTING FACT,

38:57.500 --> 38:58.766
JOE BIDEN OUT SPENT DONALD TRUMP

38:58.833 --> 38:59.433
IN EVERY SINGLE BATTLEGROUND

38:59.500 --> 39:00.766
STATE EXCEPT THE ONE AND THAT

39:00.833 --> 39:02.600
INCLUDES STATES LIKE IOWA AND

39:02.666 --> 39:04.766
OHIO THAT WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE,

39:04.833 --> 39:06.400
TRUMP WON THOSE EASILY.

39:06.466 --> 39:07.833
THE ONE STATE WERE TRUMP

39:07.900 --> 39:09.600
OUTSPENT BIDEN WAS GEORGIA, SO

39:09.666 --> 39:11.433
THIS IDEA THAT MONEY IS

39:11.500 --> 39:12.533
DETERMINATIVE BUT EVEN MORE

39:12.600 --> 39:16.000
IMPORTANTLY IN 2016, TRUMP WON

39:16.066 --> 39:17.400
GEORGIA BY FIVE POINTS AND THEN

39:17.466 --> 39:23.233
HE ADDED 360,000 VOTES IN 2020.

39:23.300 --> 39:24.966
18% INCREASE SO YOU THINK YOU

39:25.033 --> 39:26.366
CAN'T LOSE -- JOE BIDEN WINS,

39:26.433 --> 39:28.333
HOW DID THEY DO THAT?

39:28.400 --> 39:32.766
600,000 NEW VOTES, IT'S OVER 30%

39:32.833 --> 39:34.766
INCREASE, 600,000.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.433
THEY WEREN'T PULLED OUT BY

39:36.500 --> 39:38.700
TELEVISION ADS, THEY WERE PULLED

39:38.766 --> 39:40.466
OUT BY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE STACEY

39:40.533 --> 39:42.433
ABRAMS NEW GEORGIA PROJECT THAT

39:42.500 --> 39:43.233
REGISTERED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

39:43.300 --> 39:45.166
OF VOTERS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HER

39:45.233 --> 39:45.433
BUDGET IS?

39:45.500 --> 39:51.200
NEW GEORGIA PROJECT BUDGET WAS

39:51.266 --> 39:52.433
$5 MILLION, HE TALKED ABOUT

39:52.500 --> 39:53.066
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

39:53.133 --> 39:55.666
SPENT TO THE ELECTION, SHE SPENT

39:55.733 --> 39:57.833
$5 MILLION IN 2020, REGISTERED

39:57.900 --> 39:58.466
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, THAT'S

39:58.533 --> 40:00.933
WHY WE WON.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.566
>> Bill: IN 2016, WHO SPENT

40:03.633 --> 40:04.600
ALL THE MONEY?

40:04.666 --> 40:04.966
HILLARY.

40:05.033 --> 40:08.200
>> SHE OUTSPENT TRUMP 2-1.

40:08.266 --> 40:10.833
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

40:10.900 --> 40:12.133
SAYING, MONEY ALMOST WORKS

40:12.200 --> 40:14.400
AGAINST ITSELF, PEOPLE CITY AT A

40:14.466 --> 40:15.833
MILLION TIMES AND GO I'M SO

40:15.900 --> 40:17.933
FUCKING SICK OF LOOKING AT THIS

40:18.000 --> 40:19.200
ONE AD, FUCK THIS PERSON, I

40:19.266 --> 40:20.633
DON'T CARE IF I AGREE WITH THEM,

40:20.700 --> 40:22.266
NOT VOTING FOR THEM.

40:22.333 --> 40:24.633
>> WHICH IS WHY THE POINT OF THE

40:24.700 --> 40:26.533
COMMUNICATION HAS TO BE A SET OF

40:26.600 --> 40:27.233
NARRATIVES.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.600
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE TRUMP

40:28.666 --> 40:30.333
CAMPAIGN RELEASED AND SAID THIS

40:30.400 --> 40:31.433
IS WHY WE LOST -- COVID, ALL OF

40:31.500 --> 40:35.366
THESE ISSUES.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.200
I REMEMBER WATCHING BEFORE

40:37.266 --> 40:37.766
LINCOLN PROJECT STARTED IN

40:37.833 --> 40:38.900
DECEMBER, I THINK IT WAS

40:38.966 --> 40:40.766
ELIZABETH WARREN CAME OUT OF ONE

40:40.833 --> 40:42.333
OF THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATES AND

40:42.400 --> 40:43.966
SHE SAID IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL

40:44.033 --> 40:46.366
DEBATE BECAUSE NO ONE TALKED

40:46.433 --> 40:48.233
ABOUT TRUMP AND IT TERRIFIED ME.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.833
I BELIEVE FOR THE CORE OF MY

40:50.900 --> 40:52.033
BEING AND WILL INTO THE DAY I

40:52.100 --> 40:52.800
DIE AND I THINK I WAS RIGHT

40:52.866 --> 40:55.933
ABOUT THIS, THE ELECTION WAS

40:56.000 --> 40:56.300
ABOUT ONE THING.

40:56.366 --> 40:59.800
IT WAS ABOUT TRUMP.

40:59.866 --> 41:01.933
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WAS TRUMP

41:02.000 --> 41:02.733
THE NEXT TEN AFTER THAT WERE

41:02.800 --> 41:05.333
TRUMP AND THE NEXT 3,000 AFTER

41:05.400 --> 41:05.566
THAT.

41:05.633 --> 41:07.966
WE TOOK THE FIGHT TO

41:08.033 --> 41:08.433
DONALD TRUMP.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.833
WE SLUGGED HIM IN THE JOB, I

41:10.900 --> 41:12.200
THINK WE INSTILLED FIGHTING

41:12.266 --> 41:14.366
SPIRIT AND I THINK WE WERE THE

41:14.433 --> 41:15.166
FIRST GROUP THAT DREW BLOOD ON

41:15.233 --> 41:18.966
THIS GUY EFFECTIVELY.

41:19.033 --> 41:20.900
>> Bill: YOU STOLE ONE OF MY

41:20.966 --> 41:23.433
BETS.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.633
>> WHICH ONE?

41:24.700 --> 41:26.133
>> Bill: THE AD ABOUT HIM

41:26.200 --> 41:28.066
BEING INFIRM AND COULDN'T PUT A

41:28.133 --> 41:28.466
SENTENCE TOGETHER?

41:28.533 --> 41:30.300
I'M GLAD YOU DID.

41:30.366 --> 41:33.366
>> IT'S NOT YOUR MOST ORIGINAL

41:33.433 --> 41:35.666
WORK, MAKING THAT -- HIS

41:35.733 --> 41:37.066
INFIRMITY.

41:37.133 --> 41:40.466
I'M SAYING IT'S NOT, IT'S A

41:40.533 --> 41:41.000
PRETTY OBVIOUS THING.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.833
>> Bill: DON'T MAKE ME SHOW

41:42.900 --> 41:45.766
BOTH OF THEM.

41:45.833 --> 41:46.166
[LAUGHTER]

41:46.233 --> 41:47.400
DO WE HAVE THAT ONE?

41:47.466 --> 41:48.800
CAN WE SHOW HOURS?

41:48.866 --> 41:49.400
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

41:49.466 --> 41:50.666
WE DID THIS AND YOU DID YOURS

41:50.733 --> 41:51.466
ABOUT A MONTH LATER, IF YOU HAVE

41:51.533 --> 41:54.633
IT, SHOW IT NOW.

41:54.700 --> 41:58.433
WE DON'T HAVE IT, LIKE I SAID.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.766
[LAUGHTER]

42:01.833 --> 42:02.033
[APPLAUSE]

42:02.100 --> 42:02.700
WILL YOU HAVE IT SOMETIME IN THE

42:02.766 --> 42:09.566
NEXT 5 MINUTES?

42:09.633 --> 42:10.566
OKAY, THIS VIRUS GOING AROUND.

42:10.633 --> 42:12.266
>> PEOPLE ARE PISSING AWAY MONEY

42:12.333 --> 42:14.933
ON ADS, I THINK LIBERAL SHOULD

42:15.000 --> 42:15.566
DEFINITELY FOCUS ON THOSE GROUPS

42:15.633 --> 42:17.266
ON THE GROUND DOING THE

42:17.333 --> 42:19.466
REGISTERING AT PLACES LIKE

42:19.533 --> 42:20.833
ARIZONA AND TEXAS WHICH IS THE

42:20.900 --> 42:22.400
NEXT STATE THAT IS GOING TO TURN

42:22.466 --> 42:23.466
BLUE, PEOPLE THINK I'M CRAZY

42:23.533 --> 42:26.033
WHEN I SAY THIS BUT MISSISSIPPI,

42:26.100 --> 42:27.100
DEMOGRAPHICALLY SHOULD BE A

42:27.166 --> 42:29.833
COMPETITIVE STATE BUT IT HAS A

42:29.900 --> 42:31.266
BLACK COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN

42:31.333 --> 42:32.666
DISENFRANCHISED AND KEPT DOWN.

42:32.733 --> 42:33.433
THIS UNDERGROUND ORGANIZING

42:33.500 --> 42:35.766
CONFLICT STATES LIKE GEORGIA AND

42:35.833 --> 42:36.000
ARIZONA.

42:36.066 --> 42:37.300
>> Bill: WE WOULD AGREE, I

42:37.366 --> 42:39.433
USED TO BE ABLE TO BOOK YOU TWO

42:39.500 --> 42:41.166
GUYS ON THE PANEL AND HAVE YOU

42:41.233 --> 42:42.800
ARGUE, THIS IS A DEBATE SHOW,

42:42.866 --> 42:43.766
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW SHOWS

42:43.833 --> 42:45.400
THAT STILL HAS PEOPLE FROM BOTH

42:45.466 --> 42:46.000
SIDES OF THE ISLAND OPINIONS

42:46.066 --> 42:48.166
MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH -- MAYBE

42:48.233 --> 42:50.600
IT'S THE ONLY SHOW LEFT.

42:50.666 --> 42:53.566
MSNBC HAS CONSERVATIVES LIKE YOU

42:53.633 --> 42:55.433
BUT YOU'RE ONLY INVITED TO BRING

42:55.500 --> 42:57.400
THE PART OF YOU THAT IS GOING TO

42:57.466 --> 42:58.300
SAY SOMETHING THE AUDIENCE

42:58.366 --> 42:59.233
ALREADY AGREES WITH, WOULD YOU

42:59.300 --> 43:03.266
AGREE WITH THAT?

43:03.333 --> 43:04.733
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BRING YOUR

43:04.800 --> 43:05.366
CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS.

43:05.433 --> 43:08.500
>> I'VE SAT ON A LOT OF TV SETS

43:08.566 --> 43:09.866
WHERE YOU GO TO BREAK AND A LOT

43:09.933 --> 43:12.133
OF THE REPORTERS PICK UP THEIR

43:12.200 --> 43:13.433
PHONE AND THEY LOOK AT THEIR

43:13.500 --> 43:18.566
TWITTER FEEDS.

43:18.633 --> 43:19.233
THE INVISIBLE MOB POLICES WHAT'S

43:19.300 --> 43:24.433
OKAY TO SAY, TO STAY INSIDE THE

43:24.500 --> 43:26.833
LINES AND WE HAVE A PROFOUND

43:26.900 --> 43:27.433
PROBLEM, A CRISIS OF COWARDICE

43:27.500 --> 43:30.666
IN THIS COUNTRY.

43:30.733 --> 43:31.333
>> Bill: I AGREE.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.933
>> EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,

43:34.000 --> 43:35.366
COWARDICE.

43:35.433 --> 43:36.833
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SOMEONE

43:36.900 --> 43:39.166
WHO INCITED INSURRECTION EMMA

43:39.233 --> 43:40.866
CLEAR AS DAY, TEN REPUBLICANS

43:40.933 --> 43:42.266
VOTE TO IMPEACH HIM WHICH IS

43:42.333 --> 43:43.100
BETTER THAN ZERO.

43:43.166 --> 43:45.933
>> Bill: WE KNOW ABOUT THAT,

43:46.000 --> 43:46.566
LET'S GET UNDER THIS.

43:46.633 --> 43:48.633
>> EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,

43:48.700 --> 43:48.900
COWARDICE.

43:48.966 --> 43:51.233
>> Bill: ISN'T IT ALSO

43:51.300 --> 43:52.266
COWARDICE TO NOT EVER SAY

43:52.333 --> 43:54.333
ANYTHING ON MSNBC THAT YOU

43:54.400 --> 43:55.300
REALLY BELIEVE EXCEPT THE THINGS

43:55.366 --> 43:58.866
THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT

43:58.933 --> 44:02.800
AUDIENCE GO YES.

44:02.866 --> 44:04.333
I WATCHED YOU AND MICHAEL STEELE

44:04.400 --> 44:05.166
AND RICK WILSON AND NICOLE

44:05.233 --> 44:11.300
WALLACE FOR YEARS -- YOU WERE

44:11.366 --> 44:12.400
SANE CONSERVATIVES COME I DIDN'T

44:12.466 --> 44:13.400
AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT YOU

44:13.466 --> 44:14.300
SAID BUT I APPRECIATED THAT

44:14.366 --> 44:16.300
THERE WAS DIALOGUE.

44:16.366 --> 44:18.766
NOW YOU'RE JUST SOMEWHERE WHERE

44:18.833 --> 44:22.566
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO -- YOU

44:22.633 --> 44:24.500
ONLY CAN CONFIRM THE ONE TRUE

44:24.566 --> 44:25.533
OPINION.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.100
>> IT'S NOT JUST ON THE MEDIA

44:28.166 --> 44:29.766
SIDE, I HAD CHUCK TODD ON MY

44:29.833 --> 44:30.566
PODCAST AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW

44:30.633 --> 44:31.800
HE'S TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO

44:31.866 --> 44:33.433
COME ON AND DEFEND TRUMP TO SHOW

44:33.500 --> 44:34.200
THAT SIDE OF THE QUESTION BUT

44:34.266 --> 44:35.700
THEY WON'T GO THERE, THEY DON'T

44:35.766 --> 44:37.500
WANT TO BE CHALLENGED, IT'S MUCH

44:37.566 --> 44:42.633
SAFER ON FOX NEWS OR OAM.

44:42.700 --> 44:45.400
I THINK THOSE SHOWS AT THE VERY

44:45.466 --> 44:48.000
LEAST DO WANT THAT IDEOLOGICAL

44:48.066 --> 44:48.766
DIVERSITY.

44:48.833 --> 44:49.766
THE PROBLEM ISN'T PARTISANSHIP,

44:49.833 --> 44:51.200
THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE

44:51.266 --> 44:52.933
GIVEN UP ON THE TRUTH, WE CAN'T

44:53.000 --> 44:55.333
EVEN ARGUE THE SKY IS BLUE

44:55.400 --> 44:55.566
ANYMORE.

44:55.633 --> 45:00.933
>> BUT IT IS BLUE.

45:01.000 --> 45:01.566
THAT'S THE POINT.

45:01.633 --> 45:01.833
[APPLAUSE]

45:01.900 --> 45:04.866
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE HAVE

45:04.933 --> 45:05.666
TWO SIDES IN AMERICAN POLITICS

45:05.733 --> 45:05.933
RIGHT NOW.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.200
THERE'S A PRO DEMOCRACY SIDE AND

45:10.266 --> 45:11.300
THERE IS AN AUTOCRACY SIDE, AND

45:11.366 --> 45:13.500
I DON'T WANT TO DEBATE TAX RATES

45:13.566 --> 45:14.100
WHEN THE QUESTION OF DEMOCRACY

45:14.166 --> 45:16.733
IS ON THE LINE.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.333
I THINK WE'VE SEEN FIVE YEARS OF

45:19.400 --> 45:24.633
BATCH IT BA BATCH SHIT INSANITY-

45:24.700 --> 45:26.833
I HAVEN'T BEEN ENGAGED IN A

45:26.900 --> 45:31.133
POLICY DISCUSSION ON AMERICAN

45:31.200 --> 45:31.766
TELEVISION SINCE 2015 SINCE HE

45:31.833 --> 45:34.800
RAN ON ANY IDF.

45:34.866 --> 45:36.200
>> Bill: BECAUSE THEY DON'T

45:36.266 --> 45:37.733
WANT TO BRING IT UP BECAUSE YOU

45:37.800 --> 45:39.866
MIGHT SAY SOMETHING THE AUDIENCE

45:39.933 --> 45:40.300
DOES NOT AGREE WITH.

45:40.366 --> 45:42.633
>> BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE

45:42.700 --> 45:44.233
MORE EXISTENTIAL ISSUE IS.

45:44.300 --> 45:45.433
>> Bill: THERE ARE BUT IT'S

45:45.500 --> 45:47.833
NOT THE ONLY ISSUE, THEY'RE ON

45:47.900 --> 45:48.833
FUCKING 24/7.

45:48.900 --> 45:49.766
OTHER THINGS DO COME UP IF YOU

45:49.833 --> 45:50.333
WANT TO BRING THEM UP, THEY

45:50.400 --> 45:54.100
DON'T WANT TO BRING THEM UP.

45:54.166 --> 45:55.066
THIS CRAZY SHIT GOING ON ON THE

45:55.133 --> 45:57.466
LEFT, WOULD YOU NOT AGREE WITH

45:57.533 --> 45:57.666
THAT?

45:57.733 --> 45:58.700
>> ABSOLUTELY.

45:58.766 --> 46:03.400
IF THE ON.

46:03.466 --> 46:05.866
THERE IS A STRIDENT, ILLIBERAL

46:05.933 --> 46:09.166
CULTURE, AUTOCRATIC ON THE LEFT

46:09.233 --> 46:15.166
THAT IS A MIRROR ON THE TRUMP

46:15.233 --> 46:16.300
RIGHT.

46:16.366 --> 46:16.566
>> WALKED?

46:16.633 --> 46:19.600
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SORT OF

46:19.666 --> 46:19.833
TWITTER.

46:19.900 --> 46:21.600
>> THEY'RE NOT IN POWER!

46:21.666 --> 46:22.566
>> Bill: BUT THEY HAVE A LOT

46:22.633 --> 46:22.866
OF POWER.

46:22.933 --> 46:24.666
>> THEY DON'T HAVE POWER.

46:24.733 --> 46:25.900
>> Bill: THEY CERTAINLY HAVE

46:25.966 --> 46:27.833
POWER TO DISAPPEAR PEOPLE.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.033
>> THEY DO NOT RUN THE

46:30.100 --> 46:31.500
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY ARE NOT

46:31.566 --> 46:33.733
IN POWER BUT THERE IS A

46:33.800 --> 46:36.300
LIBERALISM IN AMERICAN SOCIETY.

46:36.366 --> 46:37.533
>> Bill: THEY DON'T RUN THE

46:37.600 --> 46:38.500
DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT THEY AFFECT

46:38.566 --> 46:39.633
THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS MAKE

46:39.700 --> 46:39.900
DECISIONS.

46:39.966 --> 46:43.366
>> SO IN 2004, IT WAS A VERY

46:43.433 --> 46:44.366
CLOSE ELECTION, GEORGE BUSH WON

46:44.433 --> 46:45.800
BY THE MARGIN OF OHIO AND THERE

46:45.866 --> 46:46.666
WAS AN ENTIRE CONSPIRACY THEORY

46:46.733 --> 46:50.600
ON THE LEFT THAT DEEP OLD

46:50.666 --> 46:51.633
MACHINES FLIPPED THE VOTES AND

46:51.700 --> 46:52.233
ONE OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES

46:52.300 --> 46:56.633
ON THE LEFT PUSHING THIS WAS

46:56.700 --> 46:58.366
ALEX JONES.

46:58.433 --> 46:59.233
THERE WASN'T A SINGLE PERSON IN

46:59.300 --> 47:00.633
AUTHORITY OR PEOPLE LIKE ME IN

47:00.700 --> 47:03.033
THE ACTIVISM WORLD THAT TOOK

47:03.100 --> 47:04.100
THESE PEOPLE SERIOUSLY.

47:04.166 --> 47:05.600
I KICKED THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT

47:05.666 --> 47:07.500
BECAUSE THEY WERE A CANCER ON

47:07.566 --> 47:10.166
OUR SITE.

47:10.233 --> 47:14.266
>> I THINK THAT'S TRUE FROM A

47:14.333 --> 47:15.233
MATTER OF POWER AND AUTHORITY,

47:15.300 --> 47:18.200
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE TO BILL'S

47:18.266 --> 47:24.333
POINT THAT THERE IS A LIBERALISM

47:24.400 --> 47:26.066
THAT EXISTS ON THE FASCIST

47:26.133 --> 47:26.666
RIGHT, THERE IS A LIBERALISM

47:26.733 --> 47:30.300
THAT EXISTS ON THE FAR LEFT

47:30.366 --> 47:33.033
WHERE THEY HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH

47:33.100 --> 47:36.366
A CORE VALUE OF THE

47:36.433 --> 47:37.133
ENLIGHTENMENT, OF THE NOTION OF

FREE SPEECH, FREETHINKING, FREE

47:43.400 --> 47:45.800
CULTURALLY MANIFESTED ITSELF I

47:45.866 --> 47:48.066
THINK MOST ACUTELY IN AMERICAN

47:48.133 --> 47:48.733
UNIVERSITIES.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.766
I THINK WE ARE TURNING OUT A

51:21.500 --> 51:22.533
PANDEMIC WHO SAYS "WE'RE ALL IN

51:22.600 --> 51:23.733
IT TOGETHER" MUST WORK A SHIFT

51:23.800 --> 51:24.966
AT GRUBHUB.

51:25.033 --> 51:26.966
HALF THE COUNTRY IS HOME IN

51:27.033 --> 51:27.900
THEIR COMFY CLOTHES ORDERING

51:27.966 --> 51:28.966
TAKEOUT AND THE OTHER HALF IS

51:29.033 --> 51:30.833
OUT IN THE COLD DELIVERING IT -

51:30.900 --> 51:31.600
SO STOP WITH THE "IN IT

51:31.666 --> 51:38.000

51:38.066 --> 51:40.633
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

51:40.700 --> 51:41.666

51:41.733 --> 51:44.500
NEW "THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE"

51:44.566 --> 51:46.000
- JUST SOMETHING TO SAY TO THE

51:46.066 --> 51:47.200
PEOPLE DOING THE DIRTY WORK SO

51:47.266 --> 51:48.133
WE CAN FEEL BETTER ABOUT NOT

51:48.200 --> 51:50.766
DOING IT OURSELVES.

51:50.833 --> 51:51.966
AND EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

51:52.033 --> 51:53.800
HIT, AMERICA WAS ALREADY WELL

51:53.866 --> 51:57.233
INTO BEING A "GIG ECONOMY,"

51:57.300 --> 51:58.933
WHICH SOUNDS KIND OF HIP, LIKE

51:59.000 --> 52:00.666
YOU'RE IN A ROCK BAND.

52:00.733 --> 52:01.866
EXCEPT YOU'RE NOT IN A ROCK

52:01.933 --> 52:03.466
BAND, YOU'RE DELIVERING HOT

52:03.533 --> 52:04.566
CHICKEN, AND IT DOESN'T COVER

52:04.633 --> 52:06.166
YOUR RENT.

52:06.233 --> 52:08.266
EVEN "SIDE-HUSTLE" SOUNDS KIND

52:08.333 --> 52:09.533
OF COOL - LIKE YOU'RE A PRIVATE

52:09.600 --> 52:12.466
EYE WHO RUNS DRUGS.

52:12.533 --> 52:13.600
BUT REALLY YOU'RE AN UBER DRIVER

52:13.666 --> 52:14.800
AND YOU ALSO MAKE JEWELRY OUT OF

52:14.866 --> 52:18.500
SEASHELLS.

52:18.566 --> 52:18.766
[LAUGHTER]

52:18.833 --> 52:19.833
YOU CAN CALL IT "REMOTE WORK,"

52:19.900 --> 52:20.766
BUT WHAT'S REALLY REMOTE IS ANY

52:20.833 --> 52:22.933
CHANCE OF GETTING HEALTH

52:23.000 --> 52:23.666
INSURANCE.

52:23.733 --> 52:26.200
WHAT ARE UBER AND LYFT, REALLY,

52:26.266 --> 52:28.533
BUT AMERICANIZED RICKSHAWS?

52:28.600 --> 52:29.666
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S WHAT ANYONE

52:29.733 --> 52:31.500
WANTS TO DO.

52:31.566 --> 52:33.166
NO ONE EVER HAD A FRIEND THROW

52:33.233 --> 52:34.433
UP IN THEIR BACKSEAT AND SAID,

52:34.500 --> 52:35.233
"GOSH, I HOPE SOMEDAY I CAN MAKE

52:35.300 --> 52:41.833
A CAREER OUT OF THIS."

52:41.900 --> 52:42.100
[LAUGHTER]

52:42.166 --> 52:46.233
[APPLAUSE]

52:46.300 --> 52:47.966
BUT IN THE GIG ECONOMY, EVERYONE

52:48.033 --> 52:49.566
IS A FREELANCER, AND FINDING

52:49.633 --> 52:50.866
WORK IS THE VIRTUAL EQUIVALENT

52:50.933 --> 52:51.533
OF HANGING OUT IN THE PARKING

52:51.600 --> 52:53.666
LOT AT HOME DEPOT.

52:53.733 --> 52:55.000
HAVE A SPARE ROOM YOU DON'T MIND

53:03.500 --> 53:04.400
SOME 45- YEAR-OLD GUY'S MOM'S

53:04.466 --> 53:07.633

YEAH, YOU CAN DO THAT, BUT NO

ONE DOES: IT'S WOMEN SHOWING

I'M SORRY, I'M BEING CRUDE -

54:00.233 --> 54:01.766
WHAT I MEANT WAS ONLYFANS IS A

54:01.833 --> 54:02.733
"SOCIAL MEDIA" SITE WHERE OVER A

55:18.200 --> 55:20.766
WE'LL KNOW OUR ECONOMY HAS HIT

55:20.833 --> 55:22.500
ROCK BOTTOM: WHEN YOU CAN MAKE

55:35.033 --> 55:37.400
HOW BRUTAL THIS LOCKDOWN HAS

55:37.466 --> 55:38.766
BEEN FOR SINGLE PEOPLE; OVER

HALF OF 18-TO-34-YEAR OLDS DON'T

55:39.866 --> 55:42.600
HAVE A STEADY ROMANTIC PARTNER.

55:53.166 --> 55:55.200

55:55.266 --> 55:56.933
DOUBLED, WHICH BEGS THE

55:58.533 --> 56:00.533
SUCH A LARGE PART OF THIS

ALWAYS STILL REVOLVE AROUND

56:06.233 --> 56:07.600

56:32.800 --> 56:34.966
FAMILIES BEHIND.

56:35.033 --> 56:36.200
NOW IS THE TIME TO RENEW OUR

56:36.266 --> 56:37.333
COMMITMENT TO FAMILIES AS THEY

56:37.400 --> 56:39.133
TAKE ON MOST IMPORTANT WORK ANY

56:39.200 --> 56:40.800
OF US WILL EVER DO - RAISING OUR

56:40.866 --> 56:46.833
SOCIETY'S CHILDREN."

YOU LIKE KIDS AND FAMILY?

56:59.433 --> 57:00.700
GREAT, YOU DO YOU.

57:00.766 --> 57:02.933

57:04.833 --> 57:05.766
NOT SHARING THE REMOTE OR

57:05.833 --> 57:07.500
