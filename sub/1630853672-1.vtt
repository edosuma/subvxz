Sandy?

02:02.864 --> 02:05.728
Hi, um, can my friend come with?

02:05.764 --> 02:07.062
Uh.

02:07.097 --> 02:08.628
It's my first day.

02:08.663 --> 02:10.336
I don't really know
all the rules.

02:11.971 --> 02:13.605
Yeah, sure, why not?

02:13.640 --> 02:14.868
Okay.

02:24.646 --> 02:27.120
So I'm guessing
you all are students?

02:27.155 --> 02:29.346
Wow, you must be smart
for a U-Lift driver.

02:31.156 --> 02:32.852
Come on, give me a break.

02:32.887 --> 02:36.019
Hey, I did let your friend
come along for free.

02:36.055 --> 02:38.697
Sorry, we had a big test
and it kicked our ass.

02:38.732 --> 02:40.100
No worries.

02:40.136 --> 02:42.464
-What are you studying?
-Marketing.

02:42.499 --> 02:44.162
Oh, that's cool.
That's what I studied.

02:44.197 --> 02:47.974
And now you're a U-Lift driver.
Wow, we are totally screwed.

02:48.010 --> 02:50.138
We might as well
just drop out now.

02:52.210 --> 02:54.941
Marketing is a good major.

02:54.976 --> 02:58.317
I just hit a string of bad luck,
but it's only temporary.

02:58.353 --> 03:01.450
You will for sure get good jobs
when you graduate.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.190
We'll worry about that
some other time.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.726
We're gonna hit some shrooms.
Do you wanna join?

03:05.761 --> 03:08.790
Um, I wish,

03:08.825 --> 03:11.563
but I have a big marketing job
interview to get to.

03:11.598 --> 03:15.764
Plus, it might be a little hard
to explain to my girlfriend.

03:18.830 --> 03:20.701
All right, here we are, ladies.

03:20.736 --> 03:23.134
Well,
thanks for the free ride.

03:26.512 --> 03:29.041
-Have fun with the shrooms.
-We will!

04:04.618 --> 04:08.055
You probably thought I wasn't
gonna show up, didn't you?

04:08.090 --> 04:10.753
Look, I got you something
to drink.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.950
It's okay, Mom.
I'm fine, thanks.

04:13.986 --> 04:16.391
You know you need
to stay hydrated

04:16.426 --> 04:18.765
or you'll get your headaches.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.065
Yeah, Mom, I know.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.597
Okay, I'm an adult, remember?

04:22.633 --> 04:25.196
Well, if you acted
more like an adult,

04:25.231 --> 04:28.801
then I wouldn't have to
remind you of so many things.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.438
This is what
you should be drinking.

04:31.474 --> 04:33.642
It not only hydrates you,

04:33.678 --> 04:36.973
it boosts your energy,
it aids your digestion,

04:37.009 --> 04:39.110
it provides you
with antioxidants,

04:39.146 --> 04:43.752
it detoxifies your liver,
improves your eyesight,

04:43.788 --> 04:46.318
and it will even help you
with your constipation.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.889
Jeez, Mom!

04:47.924 --> 04:50.061
Why don't you say it louder
so everybody can hear?

04:50.096 --> 04:52.564
Sorry. You know I worry.

04:53.630 --> 04:55.831
I just wanna make sure
you're okay.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.395
I know, and I appreciate that,

04:58.430 --> 05:01.507
but sometimes you just need
to dial it back a little bit.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.914
Oh, my God.

05:10.949 --> 05:12.177
Mom...

05:13.179 --> 05:15.285
Why didn't you tell me
that it tasted like...

05:15.320 --> 05:17.286
licking somebody's underarm?

05:17.321 --> 05:20.993
Well, it is fermented.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.754
You know, like sauerkraut.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.123
And it's
the fermentation process

05:25.159 --> 05:27.964
that provides you
with all the health benefits.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.670
Great.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.631
Never mind.

05:31.666 --> 05:33.966
Tell me, how are you doing?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.740
How's the new job
at the computer company?

05:38.638 --> 05:40.172
What's wrong?

05:42.007 --> 05:46.219
-I got laid off.
-You what! Why?

05:46.254 --> 05:48.888
You just started there
last month.

05:48.924 --> 05:50.424
Does it matter why?

05:52.518 --> 05:54.187
Maybe.

05:54.222 --> 05:56.953
-Did you do something wrong?
-No, I didn't do anything wrong.

05:56.989 --> 05:58.525
-Was it the hair?
-No, Mom!

05:58.560 --> 06:00.898
Okay, just calm down.

06:00.933 --> 06:04.498
They were making cuts
and I was the new guy,
so it was me.

06:04.533 --> 06:06.137
But it's okay, relax.

06:06.173 --> 06:08.565
I already have a new job.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.469
Really?

06:10.505 --> 06:12.206
That was quick.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.370
Where?

06:14.177 --> 06:15.541
U-Lift.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.314
U-Lift?

06:18.349 --> 06:20.683
Driving people around?

06:20.719 --> 06:23.820
Jeff, you know
that's not a real job, right?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.755
It is a real job.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.725
And, actually, I have to
get back to work.

06:28.761 --> 06:31.427
So thank you for the fermented
sauerkraut drink,

06:31.463 --> 06:33.896
-but I'll see ya later.
-Jeff!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.265
I-- I didn't mean that.

06:36.301 --> 06:37.763
You know I love you.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.402
And I know it's a real job,

06:39.437 --> 06:42.135
but it's just temporary, right?

06:53.152 --> 06:54.852
Oh, hey babe.

06:54.888 --> 06:56.120
Hey!

06:56.156 --> 06:57.656
Oh, that looks good.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.856
Hi.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.259
Mmm.

07:03.294 --> 07:04.557
Oh, I missed you.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.263
How was your day?

07:06.298 --> 07:08.526
Uh... it-- it was a day.

07:08.561 --> 07:09.597
Okay.

07:09.632 --> 07:11.030
But I think I made over $100,

07:11.065 --> 07:13.206
so that's not too bad
for my first day.

07:13.241 --> 07:15.238
-I don't care about that.
-Mm?

07:15.273 --> 07:16.910
Well, I do, but...

07:16.945 --> 07:18.539
how was your day?

07:18.575 --> 07:20.206
How about some wine first?

07:21.079 --> 07:22.142
Yeah.

07:25.485 --> 07:29.621
All right, where do I begin?

07:29.657 --> 07:32.590
Okay, well my first riders
were these college girls

07:32.625 --> 07:35.155
who invited me
to do mushrooms with them.

07:36.293 --> 07:38.730
Uh, did you?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.893
No, of course not.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.736
-Come on.
-I-- I just...

07:43.771 --> 07:46.636
Okay, well, then,
things got really weird
after that.

07:46.671 --> 07:48.268
There was this couple
that I picked up

07:48.303 --> 07:50.970
and they were-- they were
dressed all in black clothing.

07:51.006 --> 07:52.807
They had this like goth type
makeup on

07:52.842 --> 07:55.775
and... and what I hope
was fake blood

07:55.810 --> 07:58.645
just dripping from their chins.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.911
I tried to talk to them.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.421
I said their costumes were cool,

08:01.456 --> 08:04.814
but they just grunted
and growled at me.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.117
-Weird.
-Oh!

08:06.152 --> 08:07.960
And guess
where I dropped them off.

08:07.995 --> 08:09.019
A cemetery.

08:09.054 --> 08:12.094
What?
That is so creepy!

08:12.129 --> 08:16.498
Uh, they left me five stars
and a pretty good tip, so... eh.

08:16.534 --> 08:18.066
Was that the worst of it?

08:19.170 --> 08:20.599
No.

08:20.635 --> 08:22.169
I wish it was.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.679
The worst part
was meeting my mom
at the coffee shop.

08:27.911 --> 08:31.649
You know,
I think she cares about me,

08:31.685 --> 08:35.279
but I don't know,
sometimes she can just be

08:35.315 --> 08:37.314
just so condescending,
and she told me today

08:37.350 --> 08:39.723
that she doesn't think
U-Lift is a real job.

08:39.759 --> 08:42.024
And it just made me feel
really crappy, you know?

08:43.359 --> 08:44.496
Yeah.

08:44.531 --> 08:46.358
I'm just happy
to be home with you.

08:50.171 --> 08:51.834
So, do you travel a lot?

08:51.869 --> 08:54.371
To some people
it might seem like a lot.

08:54.406 --> 08:57.309
To me, it's not too bad.

08:57.344 --> 08:59.872
-I still enjoy it.
-Cool.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.079
Do you have a favorite place?

09:02.115 --> 09:03.512
Oh, do I!

09:03.548 --> 09:05.215
Yeah, that would be India.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.950
Wow, India.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.322
And why's that?

09:09.358 --> 09:11.757
Wow,
where would I start?

09:12.893 --> 09:17.158
To me, India is just--
the natural beauty
is just awesome.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.562
The diversity of people.

09:20.597 --> 09:22.427
The sheer nature of it.

09:23.869 --> 09:27.465
And the people there,
wow, just so amazing.

09:32.378 --> 09:33.771
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!

09:33.807 --> 09:35.077
What the hell?

09:38.079 --> 09:39.851
-Ugh!

10:01.842 --> 10:04.269
-Crap! Could it get any worse?
-What's going on?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.946
Because of you,
I'm gonna miss my meeting.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.739
-Have you ever gotten
a zero star rating?
-Oh, come on, man.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.914
What happened to all that peace
and love and friendship stuff?

10:12.949 --> 10:14.386
All that stuff
was left back in India.

10:14.421 --> 10:16.289
I need to get to my meeting now.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.285
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I...

10:18.984 --> 10:20.593
I tell you what.

10:20.628 --> 10:23.488
I'll take off the charge
for the ride, and...

10:26.460 --> 10:28.592
You can have this too.
That's all the money I have.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.800
Please don't
give me a bad rating.
I need this job.

10:30.835 --> 10:32.965
How are you gonna be
a U-Lift driver

10:33.000 --> 10:35.170
with a piece of junk of a car?

10:39.445 --> 10:40.879
You need some help?

10:41.547 --> 10:43.107
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.811
With the car, I mean.

10:45.847 --> 10:47.215
You need to move it.

10:48.519 --> 10:51.725
Um, yeah, thanks.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.278
Thanks man, I--
I really appreciate the help.

11:14.313 --> 11:15.716
Sure thing.

11:20.822 --> 11:24.087
I'm sorry, I just gave
my last cash to the rider.

11:30.431 --> 11:32.898
So, what's the news?

11:34.059 --> 11:35.428
I lost my job.

11:36.866 --> 11:38.536
You got fired from U-Lift?

11:38.571 --> 11:41.332
No, I can't drive U-Lift anymore

11:41.367 --> 11:43.572
because my stupid car
broke down.

11:43.607 --> 11:47.605
And the mechanic said
it would be $1,000 to fix,
which I can't afford.

11:49.677 --> 11:51.213
I see.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.015
Sam, I don't think
you understand.

11:54.050 --> 11:56.721
If I don't work,
we can't afford rent.

11:56.756 --> 11:58.887
And we'll get kicked out
of our house.

11:58.923 --> 12:00.517
We can't afford
to live together,

12:00.552 --> 12:03.190
so I'll be forced to go move in
with my mom.

12:03.225 --> 12:05.491
There's no way in hell
that's happening.

12:05.526 --> 12:09.836
So, basically we're done
and I'm going to be homeless.

12:11.205 --> 12:14.767
And you don't think
you're overreacting
like just a little bit?

12:14.803 --> 12:16.265
No, no, I don't.

12:16.301 --> 12:17.940
My life is shit right now.

12:17.975 --> 12:20.004
I am on the worst string
of bad luck.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.780
Nothing is going right,
everything is falling apart,
not just my stupid car.

12:23.815 --> 12:26.419
-I think I'm cursed.
-Maybe so.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.052
But you know what they say,

12:28.087 --> 12:30.586
"It's always darkest
before the dawn," and all that.

12:30.621 --> 12:32.516
So, um, who knows?

12:32.552 --> 12:35.488
Maybe today is the day
that everything changes.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.797
What does that even mean?

12:37.833 --> 12:40.595
Are you gonna give me
some positivity pep talk?

12:40.630 --> 12:43.229
No.

12:43.264 --> 12:45.362
Remember my friend
from work, Kumar?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.299
Uh, yeah,
he's the IT guy, right?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.433
Yeah, well, he told me
this morning

12:49.468 --> 12:51.940
that he's going to India
for three months

12:51.976 --> 12:54.306
to visit his home city
of Baroda.

12:54.342 --> 12:57.083
Okay, so how is that
good news for me?

12:57.119 --> 12:58.984
Because...

13:02.686 --> 13:05.723
he gave me his car

13:05.758 --> 13:10.122
and said that I can use it
whenever I want while he's gone
so it doesn't just sit around.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.295
And it's a really nice car.

13:13.330 --> 13:16.333
Much better than the old smokey
that you were driving.

13:16.368 --> 13:18.064
So...

13:18.099 --> 13:20.505
you can use it, if you want,

13:20.540 --> 13:22.205
until yours gets fixed.

13:29.146 --> 13:32.177
<i>♪ Keep it all</i>
<i>Under lock and key ♪</i>

13:32.213 --> 13:35.116
<i>♪ On a test and a mystery ♪</i>

13:35.152 --> 13:38.252

13:38.287 --> 13:41.424

13:41.460 --> 13:45.191
Then he says he's been
sleeping with my sister,

13:45.227 --> 13:47.928
but still wants
to go out with me.

13:47.963 --> 13:49.663
Can you believe that?

13:49.698 --> 13:50.935
Jeez.

13:50.970 --> 13:52.997
Is that when you punched him
in the face?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.334
I should have.

13:54.370 --> 13:56.334
Instead, I just threw my beer
at him and left.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.269
Well, good for you.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.641
But, still, that really sucks.

14:00.676 --> 14:02.046
It does.

14:02.082 --> 14:04.509
But it's all right because
when I left his place,

14:04.544 --> 14:06.744
I went to his brother's
and slept with him.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.388
Nice sign.

14:14.891 --> 14:16.358
Hey, I know that guy.

14:17.893 --> 14:18.960
Wave him over.

14:18.995 --> 14:20.527
Hey, come here.

14:24.269 --> 14:26.973
Hey, man, thanks again
for the help with my car.

14:27.937 --> 14:29.204
You're welcome, sir.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.872
I really appreciate it.
You did me a favor.

14:31.907 --> 14:33.276
You deserve this.

14:35.615 --> 14:37.008
Thank you, General.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.042
Your Majesty.

14:52.265 --> 14:54.834
Well, I'm sorry things
didn't work out
with his brother,

14:54.869 --> 14:57.663
but I hope things work out
with his cousin.

14:58.532 --> 15:00.330
-I've got a good feeling.

15:00.365 --> 15:01.634
Thanks for listening.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.172
Oh, hey, you dropped some money.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.776
Not mine.

15:22.626 --> 15:23.755
Huh.

15:26.429 --> 15:30.360
I can't even describe
how happy I was all day

15:30.396 --> 15:32.104
after finding that money.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.008
I felt like I was floating.

15:35.806 --> 15:37.208
What'd I tell ya?

15:40.680 --> 15:42.774
I know, but...

15:47.312 --> 15:48.549
What's wrong?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.632
I'm really happy right now.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.530
I can't even describe it.

16:03.498 --> 16:06.501
But I'm also excited
and-- and scared too.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.936
Scared?

16:08.971 --> 16:10.835
Why? What's wrong?

16:12.942 --> 16:16.783
Well, this is the first bit
of good luck I've had
in awhile, and...

16:16.818 --> 16:18.645
I hope it's a sign
of things to come,

16:18.681 --> 16:22.011
but I'm scared
it'll all be over
before I know it.

16:22.046 --> 16:25.256
So, I'm worried and wondering
how to keep it going.

16:26.660 --> 16:30.195
Jeff, honey, relax.

16:31.160 --> 16:35.195
Luck, good fortune, magic...

16:35.230 --> 16:37.427
whatever you wanna call it,

16:37.462 --> 16:39.763
you can't keep it going

16:39.798 --> 16:42.406
any more than you can keep
a wave going.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.776
You just have to ride it
for as long as it lasts

16:45.811 --> 16:49.038
and then, like surfing,

16:49.073 --> 16:52.118
keep an eye out for the next one
and get ready for it.

17:05.327 --> 17:07.625
-Can you pop the trunk?
-Sure.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.630
-Do you need a hand?
-Nah, I got it.

17:25.053 --> 17:27.883
Hey, hope you didn't put
a dead body in there.

17:27.919 --> 17:29.653
Not the entire body.

17:29.689 --> 17:31.223
Just some parts.

17:33.759 --> 17:35.328
Just kidding.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.099
It's just some gear I'm using
for a workshop I'm doing.

17:44.468 --> 17:47.531
Hey, do you mind if I make
a stop real quick?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.175
Sure, go ahead.

17:56.648 --> 17:57.810
Hey.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.182
-Are you following me?

18:02.217 --> 18:04.221
-Busted.

18:04.256 --> 18:06.183
What are you doing
all the way over here?

18:06.218 --> 18:08.054
What?

18:08.089 --> 18:11.627
I can't come downtown
because I'm currently
without a residence?

18:11.662 --> 18:15.399
No, you're just a long way
from where I saw you last time.

18:15.434 --> 18:18.171
You must be tired as shit
from walking all that way.

18:20.165 --> 18:24.210
I don't have any money on me
right now, but, um... hold on.

18:29.982 --> 18:32.680
That's mighty nice.
Thanks.

18:34.118 --> 18:35.947
I gotta run, but I can come back

18:35.982 --> 18:38.686
and give you a ride
after I drop my passenger off.

18:39.627 --> 18:40.759
Not necessary.

18:40.795 --> 18:42.558
But thanks for the lunch.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.169
Uh, can I help you with these?

18:59.205 --> 19:02.248
I should be able to carry it on
if you just wanna hand it to me.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.917
-Thanks.
-Yeah, sure.

19:06.953 --> 19:08.182
And what about your bags?

19:08.217 --> 19:09.482
Um, they're not mine.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.689
Gotta go.
Don't wanna be late.

19:19.357 --> 19:20.830
Huh.

19:31.369 --> 19:32.711
Wow...

19:32.747 --> 19:34.346
What are all these?

19:35.640 --> 19:38.711
I mean, I am hungry.

19:38.747 --> 19:41.988
-What are you making me
for dinner?

19:42.023 --> 19:44.885
I haven't even thought
about that yet.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.693
Are you sure you didn't leave
some groceries in the car?

19:47.728 --> 19:49.157
Mm-hmm, I'm sure.

19:49.192 --> 19:51.296
Why do you keep asking?

19:51.331 --> 19:55.795
Well, if you didn't leave
groceries in the car

19:55.831 --> 19:59.063
and none of my riders did,
I didn't buy this stuff.

20:00.704 --> 20:03.570
You know you shouldn't drink
on an empty stomach.

20:03.605 --> 20:05.670
Come on, let me make you
some dinner.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.080
-Come on. Come on.
-Yeah.

20:08.115 --> 20:11.383
I know I can't make luck
continue...

20:12.386 --> 20:15.154
but I sure would like to know
what's causing this.

20:15.190 --> 20:18.019
You know, like how waves
are caused by the wind?

20:18.055 --> 20:21.522
Isn't it enough to know
that maybe you're just having
some good luck

20:21.557 --> 20:23.923
and things are finally
going your way?

20:25.029 --> 20:26.398
Yeah, I guess.

20:27.734 --> 20:31.598
But if I could just figure out
what's causing this wave,
then...

20:31.633 --> 20:33.700
maybe I could get
in the sweet spot

20:33.735 --> 20:36.133
-and ride it
for as long as possible.
-Mm.

20:37.142 --> 20:38.670
Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.

20:38.706 --> 20:42.440
-I need your help on this.
-Okay.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.583
I'm in. I'll help.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.275
Okay.

20:46.310 --> 20:49.614
So I found money
and a bunch of groceries
in my car--

20:49.649 --> 20:52.091
well, in your friend's car--

20:52.126 --> 20:55.018
after I dropped off
two passengers.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.926
And it didn't belong
to your passengers?

20:57.961 --> 21:00.055
Correct.

21:00.091 --> 21:03.565
Then you dropped off
other passengers,

21:03.600 --> 21:06.966
but didn't find anything
with them, right?

21:08.266 --> 21:13.036
So, what did
those two passengers
have in common

21:13.071 --> 21:17.914
that wasn't true
for the other passengers?

21:20.020 --> 21:23.251
I got it. I got it!

21:23.286 --> 21:25.624
Okay. You gonna tell me?

21:25.660 --> 21:26.689
I got it!

21:27.854 --> 21:31.364
You'll know tomorrow
if I'm right.

21:32.094 --> 21:33.498
Jeff!

21:37.462 --> 21:38.635
Well...

21:54.952 --> 21:56.448
Hey.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.815
-Hey.
-Hmm.

21:57.851 --> 21:59.622
I'm gonna go do
some early driving

21:59.657 --> 22:02.188
so we can hang out
later this afternoon, okay?

22:02.223 --> 22:03.823
Okay.

22:03.858 --> 22:05.893
What did you want me
to pick up for you?

22:07.033 --> 22:08.934
Um, some running shoes.

22:08.970 --> 22:11.033
Mine are getting worn out.

22:11.069 --> 22:12.603
Okay, what kind?

22:13.637 --> 22:18.502
Uh, just the kind
that I have is fine.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.110
Where are they?

22:20.145 --> 22:22.310
-Under the bed.
-Okay.

22:22.345 --> 22:23.878
Now go back to sleep.

22:31.652 --> 22:34.625
-Hmm.

22:39.932 --> 22:41.557
Hey... babe.

22:41.593 --> 22:42.801
Hi.

22:42.836 --> 22:44.366
Uh...

22:44.401 --> 22:46.035
Excuse me.

22:46.070 --> 22:47.039
Okay.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.035
Oh, my gosh.
What did you do?

22:50.071 --> 22:52.940
I have a little bit
of a surprise for you.

22:53.874 --> 22:56.081
-What did you do?

22:56.116 --> 22:58.542
I hope you like these.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.882
Uh...

22:59.918 --> 23:01.080
Um.

23:02.847 --> 23:05.320
Babe, these are awesome!

23:05.355 --> 23:06.589
Why are there so many?

23:06.624 --> 23:08.488
I mean, I'm not mad,
I'm-- that's great,

23:08.524 --> 23:11.226
but why'd you buy so many?

23:11.262 --> 23:12.997
I didn't buy these.

23:13.032 --> 23:14.394
What do you mean?

23:14.430 --> 23:15.730
I didn't buy these.

23:15.766 --> 23:18.564
I found all these boxes
in the back of the car.

23:18.599 --> 23:22.805
And I think I know now
what's causing this wave
of good luck for me, you know?

23:24.637 --> 23:25.940
Well, what is it?

23:28.213 --> 23:29.515
It's a homeless guy.

23:31.109 --> 23:34.843
I-- I mean,
can you believe that?

23:34.879 --> 23:36.181
It's a homeless guy.

23:37.225 --> 23:40.254
Okay, so when you say
"homeless,"

23:40.290 --> 23:42.091
you mean like...

23:42.126 --> 23:44.690
I don't know exactly,
but-- but every time
I give him something,

23:44.725 --> 23:46.761
I get back 10 times as much.

23:46.797 --> 23:49.860
So I gave him $20
and then I got back $200.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.302
And one day I gave him lunch,

23:51.337 --> 23:53.066
and we got
all those groceries.

23:53.101 --> 23:56.739
So today I gave him
your old pair of running shoes

23:56.775 --> 24:00.513
and found all these boxes
in the back of my car.

24:03.274 --> 24:08.383
I think he's like a magical
good luck charm.

24:08.418 --> 24:10.886
Or a-- a magical wave.

24:12.118 --> 24:16.654
Well, I think that
we should ride this wave

24:16.690 --> 24:18.861
for all it's worth.

24:19.759 --> 24:20.899
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

24:20.935 --> 24:22.832
Okay.

24:26.538 --> 24:29.003
-To Homeless Guy.

24:32.945 --> 24:34.643
Mm.

24:34.678 --> 24:36.615
Oh, this is
some really good wine.

24:36.650 --> 24:39.241
I found it in the groceries
that were in the car.

24:39.276 --> 24:41.411
But I think we only have
one bottle left.

24:43.223 --> 24:44.887
I sure would like some more.

24:47.621 --> 24:49.152
How about you?

24:49.188 --> 24:51.531
You wanna give wine
to a homeless guy?

24:52.999 --> 24:54.663
I mean...

24:54.698 --> 24:57.735
-To Homeless Guy.
-To Homeless Guy.

25:23.859 --> 25:26.963
Josh West?
Dude, are you kidding?

25:26.999 --> 25:29.995
Man, I've been a fan of yours
since you were on<i> The Voice.</i>

25:30.031 --> 25:32.897
And I love your band
Vanilla Aardvark.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.566
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

25:34.602 --> 25:35.803
No, I'm serious.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.667
I listen to your music
all the time.

25:37.702 --> 25:38.875
Awesome.

25:42.182 --> 25:43.407
Are you ready to go?

25:44.876 --> 25:46.211
Yeah, sorry, man.

25:46.246 --> 25:48.514
I didn't mean to go
all fan boy on you there.

25:48.549 --> 25:49.820
No worries.

26:05.264 --> 26:09.501
Hey, uh, Josh,
sorry to bother you, man.

26:09.536 --> 26:10.703
Mm-hmm.

26:10.739 --> 26:12.769
Can I ask you a big favor?

26:12.805 --> 26:14.009
Sure, what's up?

26:15.372 --> 26:17.615
Would you mind singing
a song for me?

26:17.650 --> 26:20.448
Well, not for me,
but for my girlfriend.

26:20.483 --> 26:22.384
She loves you too.

26:22.420 --> 26:24.055
But she's not here.

26:24.091 --> 26:25.284
Not a problem.

26:29.127 --> 26:30.759
Babe...

26:30.794 --> 26:33.630
guess who I have
in the car right now.

26:33.665 --> 26:35.465
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i>Your mom?</i>

26:35.500 --> 26:38.932
Not even close.

26:38.967 --> 26:41.440
It's Josh West
from Vanilla Aardvark.

26:41.475 --> 26:44.537
<i>-Yeah, right!</i>
-No, I'm serious.

26:44.573 --> 26:45.939
And guess what.

26:45.974 --> 26:47.776
He said he would
sing a song for you.

26:47.811 --> 26:49.576
Hey, can you do that one
about magic?

26:49.611 --> 26:50.742
We love that one.

26:50.778 --> 26:52.212

30:06.337 --> 30:07.913
To riding the magic wave.

30:09.109 --> 30:10.850
To riding the magic wave.

30:16.687 --> 30:19.991
And... to getting more.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.720
To having more.

30:27.565 --> 30:29.193
Anything else?

30:29.228 --> 30:31.132
Well, I have been thinking.

30:31.168 --> 30:34.731
And I think that we need
to be more strategic.

30:35.804 --> 30:37.035
What do you mean?

30:37.071 --> 30:39.104
Well, don't get me wrong.

30:39.139 --> 30:41.774
I love getting all the things

30:41.810 --> 30:44.616
and the fact that
we've been able to make
a couple thousand dollars

30:44.652 --> 30:48.016
from selling the surplus
is great.

30:48.051 --> 30:50.280
I just think it's time
that we got back

30:50.315 --> 30:52.315
to the way that you started.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.126
You know, by giving him money.

30:54.161 --> 30:55.356
Okay.

30:57.221 --> 30:59.288
That makes sense.

30:59.323 --> 31:01.126
But it won't be as fun.

31:01.162 --> 31:04.226
Since when is more money
not fun?

31:04.261 --> 31:05.597
Okay, good point.

31:06.340 --> 31:07.863
To more money.

31:08.441 --> 31:09.700
To more money.

31:28.519 --> 31:30.154
How much
are you gonna give him?

31:30.189 --> 31:32.261
I was thinking $1,000.

31:33.259 --> 31:37.167
That would give us $10,000.

31:38.866 --> 31:40.269
Yeah, okay.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.611
So how long
have you been working
for U-Lift?

31:46.646 --> 31:48.775
Uh, a little over a month now.

31:48.810 --> 31:50.373
You like it?

31:50.408 --> 31:52.047
It didn't start off too well,

31:52.082 --> 31:56.719
but lately it's been
very rewarding.

31:56.754 --> 31:58.122
That's good.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.095
What's up, buttercup?

32:12.130 --> 32:15.737
Hey,
it looks like this corner's
getting pretty crowded.

32:15.772 --> 32:17.272
Probably my fault.

32:17.307 --> 32:18.940
I've been talking too much
about the good luck

32:18.976 --> 32:20.672
I've been having
on this corner.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.373
What's going on?

32:23.408 --> 32:25.543
Is there a convention in town?

32:25.578 --> 32:28.884
Oh, no, I'm just trying
to do a good deed

32:28.919 --> 32:30.517
for someone less fortunate.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.326
Don't tell anyone about this.

32:48.108 --> 32:50.237
Hey, sorry for the detour
back there.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.308
Maybe it was
just a fender bender.

32:55.878 --> 32:57.181
Have a nice day.

32:58.145 --> 32:59.784
You too.

32:59.820 --> 33:02.480
Oh, yeah,
I definitely will.

33:02.515 --> 33:04.315
Can you meet me
at the coffee shop now?

33:04.351 --> 33:06.157
<i> Sure, hon.</i>
<i>On my way.</i>

33:10.693 --> 33:11.822
Well?

33:27.380 --> 33:28.644
Jeff!

33:55.268 --> 33:56.799
This seems really quick.

33:56.834 --> 34:00.402
Why? Look, if we just give him
this money,

34:00.438 --> 34:03.174
we'll have $100,000.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.313
Yeah, good point.

34:05.348 --> 34:08.518
Hey, um, do you know
where the other guy is?

34:08.553 --> 34:11.316
I don't know his name,
but he usually stands
on this corner.

34:11.351 --> 34:13.249
You got a better description?

34:13.285 --> 34:15.851
Um, well, he...

34:15.886 --> 34:17.562
Yeah, he's the guy
with the funny signs.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.395
We all got signs.

34:20.693 --> 34:22.926
What, you don't think
my sign is funny?

34:23.964 --> 34:25.170
Not bad.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.599
You're not gonna give me
something?

34:28.635 --> 34:30.670
Sorry, man,
you're not the right guy.

34:31.435 --> 34:33.310
Cheap bastard.

35:33.939 --> 35:35.834
You lost your good luck charm.

35:38.008 --> 35:40.138
He's a person, Sam.

35:40.174 --> 35:41.774
Mm, a person.

35:41.809 --> 35:45.382
-Whose name
you don't know. Nice.

35:48.448 --> 35:50.086
It's been less than a day.

35:50.122 --> 35:52.154
Okay, I saw him
yesterday morning.

35:52.190 --> 35:55.527
-I'll find him, don't worry.
-Mm.

35:55.563 --> 35:59.495
Yeah, well, you're not taking
the 10 grand with you
until you do.

36:03.668 --> 36:05.502
Okay.

36:05.537 --> 36:08.631
-Let me just get a shower
and some coffee,

36:08.666 --> 36:10.305
and I'll get back out there.

36:10.340 --> 36:12.376
He's gotta be
out there somewhere.

36:16.077 --> 36:17.307
Hey, Mom.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.613
What's wrong?

36:20.647 --> 36:23.847
Yeah, okay, sure,
I'll meet you.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.620
But then I have to
get out there and drive.

36:26.656 --> 36:31.025
Okay, U-Lift is my job, Mom,
and it's a real job.

36:31.061 --> 36:32.561
I'll see you later.

36:41.235 --> 36:42.971
Come, sit down.

36:43.007 --> 36:44.474
How's my boy doing?

36:47.003 --> 36:48.973
Mom, you know
I don't like that stuff.

36:49.783 --> 36:51.145
Remember what I said?

36:51.180 --> 36:52.976
It's an acquired taste.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.679
You won't like it
until you drink enough of it

36:55.715 --> 36:57.982
so your distaste for it
goes away.

36:59.290 --> 37:02.325
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Really?

37:02.361 --> 37:04.923
Think about the first time
you drank a beer.

37:14.071 --> 37:16.440
So, what's the big 911?

37:16.476 --> 37:20.239
Oh, I just wanted to see you
and see how you're doing.

37:20.274 --> 37:22.377
It's been so long.

37:22.413 --> 37:24.512
I'm sorry I don't call you
more often.

37:24.547 --> 37:27.076
But I am thinking about you
all the time.

37:27.112 --> 37:30.682
I just wanted to see you,
see how you're doing.

37:30.718 --> 37:33.855
And you don't look too good
right now.

37:33.890 --> 37:34.986
Well...

37:37.222 --> 37:40.299
everything was going fine
until yesterday and then...

37:42.428 --> 37:44.263
You can tell me.

37:44.298 --> 37:45.802
It's a long story.

37:51.441 --> 37:54.104
And that's how I lost
my lucky charm.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.215
I'm sorry you feel that way,
but...

37:57.250 --> 37:59.745
I really don't think
that's what happened.

37:59.781 --> 38:02.418
What do you mean?
I-- I can't find the guy.

38:02.454 --> 38:05.486
Well, I mean, I think
it wasn't luck at all.

38:05.521 --> 38:07.620
I-- I don't think
you need that guy,

38:07.656 --> 38:10.458
though it was nice
that you helped him.

38:10.493 --> 38:13.892
I actually think
it was instant karma.

38:13.928 --> 38:16.625
I read about it the other day
on the "interweb."

38:16.660 --> 38:19.101
It's fascinating.

38:19.136 --> 38:21.065
Have you heard of it?

38:22.309 --> 38:26.135
Instant karma
is when you do good for anyone

38:26.170 --> 38:29.972
and something good
immediately happens for you.

38:30.007 --> 38:32.477
That's what happened,
I'm sure of it.

38:32.512 --> 38:33.979
All you need to do now

38:34.014 --> 38:38.150
is go back to work at your job
and do good to anyone.

38:38.820 --> 38:43.318
Did you just say
what I do for U-Lift is a job?

38:44.864 --> 38:46.591
I sure did, honey.

38:46.626 --> 38:48.928
I'm sorry about the other day.

38:49.962 --> 38:52.636
I also read about U-Lift
on the "interweb"

38:52.672 --> 38:57.376
and now see
it is a valuable part
of our new gig economy.

38:58.637 --> 39:01.179
Mom, you're incredible.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.514
I don't care what anyone
says about you.

39:04.713 --> 39:07.276
-What are people
saying about me?

39:07.819 --> 39:09.317
Nothing.

39:09.352 --> 39:11.214
Nobody's talking about you, Mom.

39:12.691 --> 39:16.819
I have to get back to work,
but thanks for the drink.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.292
It wasn't as bad as last time.

39:18.328 --> 39:20.898
See, what did I tell you?

39:20.933 --> 39:22.434
Just like a beer!

39:45.025 --> 39:46.391
Mom, I can't talk right now.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.421
I have a passenger
I have to pick up right here.

39:48.456 --> 39:50.257
I know, honey, it's me.

39:50.293 --> 39:51.760
I'm your passenger.

39:56.234 --> 39:57.865
How can I tell all my friends

39:57.900 --> 40:01.165
how much I love and support you
if I don't support you?

40:02.767 --> 40:04.135
You're awesome, Mom.

40:13.281 --> 40:14.683
Hey, man.

40:14.719 --> 40:17.148
You look thirsty.
Do you want something to drink?

40:18.090 --> 40:19.755
Uh, not really, no.

40:22.095 --> 40:23.861
I knew I should've gotten water.

40:23.896 --> 40:25.220
Just relax.

40:25.255 --> 40:27.129
The universe will bring you
the right person

40:27.165 --> 40:28.533
at the perfect time.

40:38.605 --> 40:40.572
Are you thirsty?

40:40.607 --> 40:42.478
Yeah.
Can I have that?

40:42.513 --> 40:44.141
You know what this stuff is,
right?

40:44.177 --> 40:47.044
-Yeah, I've had that before.
-All right.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.884
Sorry, I don't have some food
to give you too.

40:49.920 --> 40:53.349
Aw, thanks, man.
But like my sign says,
anything helps.

40:54.489 --> 40:55.751
Wait a minute.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.386
Let's give him this.

41:02.802 --> 41:03.832
Wow.

41:05.662 --> 41:08.068
Wow!

41:08.103 --> 41:10.568
Thanks, man.
You don't know how much
this is gonna help.

41:10.604 --> 41:11.837
It's not a problem.

41:11.872 --> 41:13.443
Hey, what's your name,
by the way?

41:13.478 --> 41:16.244
Charles.
But my friends call me Chuck.

41:16.279 --> 41:17.580
All right, Chuck.

41:17.615 --> 41:19.842
It's nice to meet you.
I'll see you around.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.284
Oh, thank you so much.

41:21.319 --> 41:23.379
God bless you, God bless you.

41:29.822 --> 41:32.595
That's it, we did our part.

41:32.630 --> 41:35.391
Now we just wait for it
to come back to us.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.002
Thanks again, Mom.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.370
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

41:49.405 --> 41:51.774
I guess everything you read
on the internet

41:51.809 --> 41:53.644
isn't always true.

41:53.679 --> 41:54.979
That's okay, Mom.

41:55.014 --> 41:57.083
It was just fun
to hang out with you.

42:03.559 --> 42:05.355
Where have you been all day?

42:05.922 --> 42:07.656
I was with my mom.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.700
Oh, great.

42:09.735 --> 42:12.804
Bet you didn't even try
to look for your lucky charm.

42:12.839 --> 42:14.430
Correct.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.706
I told you not to waste
your time with her.

42:17.741 --> 42:20.244
You know she doesn't
even believe in you.

42:20.279 --> 42:21.842
Well, right now it seems like

42:21.877 --> 42:24.346
you're the one
who doesn't believe in me.

42:24.381 --> 42:26.409
Well, can you blame me?

42:27.620 --> 42:29.583
It seems like
you're pretty tired right now.

42:29.618 --> 42:31.213
Maybe you should just go to bed.

42:31.248 --> 42:35.055
Who are you
to tell me what to do?

42:35.090 --> 42:38.923
You were failing at one thing
and then another thing,

42:38.959 --> 42:41.257
and I'm the one
that stood by you

42:41.292 --> 42:43.866
when no one in their right mind
would have.

42:43.901 --> 42:47.603
You know, sometimes
I wonder why I even did that.

42:47.638 --> 42:51.036
Wow, thanks for the vote
of confidence.

42:51.071 --> 42:54.409
You stumbled upon
the biggest lucky charm

42:54.444 --> 42:55.911
that I've ever heard of,

42:55.946 --> 42:58.906
and then right before
we can hit it big, you blow it!

42:58.942 --> 43:00.542
You lose him,

43:00.577 --> 43:04.254
and now you're acting
like it's not even a big deal!

43:04.289 --> 43:06.020
Hey, will you calm down?

43:07.820 --> 43:09.890
I know it's a big deal.

43:09.926 --> 43:13.355
And I'm sorry
that I "lost the homeless guy."

43:13.390 --> 43:15.796
But did you ever think
that maybe he wasn't

43:15.831 --> 43:18.398
the lucky charm
that we thought he was?

43:18.434 --> 43:19.765
Of course he is.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.264
What are you talking about?

43:21.300 --> 43:23.867
How else do you explain
all of the magical stuff

43:23.902 --> 43:25.066
that's been happening?

43:25.101 --> 43:26.711
What if it wasn't him?

43:28.180 --> 43:29.981
What if it was...

43:30.017 --> 43:31.546
instant karma?

43:31.581 --> 43:33.743
Did you ever think about that?

43:33.779 --> 43:35.445
Instant karma?

43:36.419 --> 43:37.387
What is that?

43:37.422 --> 43:39.185
My Mom told me about it today.

43:40.260 --> 43:41.559
She read about it online.

43:41.595 --> 43:45.991
It's the act of doing
a good deed to anyone

43:46.027 --> 43:48.128
resulting in good
coming back to you.

43:48.859 --> 43:50.295
Seriously?

43:51.170 --> 43:52.894
It's a real thing.

43:52.930 --> 43:54.804
I looked it up.

43:54.839 --> 43:56.966
So Mom and I drove around
all day giving stuff

43:57.001 --> 43:58.910
to another homeless guy.

43:58.945 --> 44:00.140
Well?

44:02.510 --> 44:03.748
Did it work?

44:04.544 --> 44:05.574
No.

44:06.878 --> 44:08.983
Are you sure?

44:09.018 --> 44:11.585
Yeah, we checked everywhere
in the car and...

44:11.621 --> 44:13.186
and didn't find anything.

44:14.217 --> 44:15.620
What about the hatchback?

44:43.580 --> 44:45.947
So how is your day going today?

44:45.983 --> 44:48.188
Oh, pretty good.

44:48.223 --> 44:50.217
I got in a big fight
with my girlfriend last night,

44:50.253 --> 44:52.692
but we've already made up.

44:52.727 --> 44:54.890
Wow, that's impressive.

44:54.926 --> 44:56.293
What did you do?

44:56.328 --> 44:58.567
Well, I have to give her
most of the credit.

44:58.602 --> 45:00.900
But I did make her pancakes.

45:00.936 --> 45:03.137
So that's your secret?
Pancakes.

45:05.576 --> 45:07.603
Sorry to bother you, but...

45:08.238 --> 45:09.371
you look really familiar.

45:09.406 --> 45:11.080
Should I recognize you
from somewhere?

45:12.350 --> 45:15.982
Well, maybe you've seen
my photo in the post office
on the wall there.

45:16.017 --> 45:19.150
-America's most wanted.

45:19.185 --> 45:21.890
I don't think
they do that anymore.

45:21.925 --> 45:24.928
But, seriously,
where do I know you from?

45:26.396 --> 45:27.431
You got me.

45:27.466 --> 45:29.597
So, I'm the Mayor of Chandler.

45:29.632 --> 45:31.726
I knew it. I knew it!

45:32.866 --> 45:34.234
That's pretty cool.

45:35.638 --> 45:37.839
It must be a tough job.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.875
Everybody wanting
something from you.

45:39.910 --> 45:42.979
That it is, my friend.
That it is.

45:49.085 --> 45:51.614
Hey, before you go,
can I give you something?

45:52.487 --> 45:53.517
Sure.

45:56.493 --> 45:57.796
A stick of gum?

45:58.563 --> 46:00.195
Should I take this personally?

46:00.231 --> 46:03.965
No, no,
I'm just giving a small gift
to all my riders today

46:04.001 --> 46:06.770
to celebrate me
making up with my girlfriend.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.266
That's just what I grabbed
from the bag,

46:08.302 --> 46:10.875
but you can take
something else if you'd like.

46:11.475 --> 46:12.608
No, this is good.

46:12.643 --> 46:14.879
Maybe I do need it.
Thanks.

46:23.820 --> 46:25.956
Hi there.
Let me help you out.

46:27.352 --> 46:29.556
Oh, one second.
Let me move this.

46:38.128 --> 46:39.794
Sorry about that.

46:45.212 --> 46:46.735
Just right here.

46:55.048 --> 46:57.480
So, how's your day going so far?

46:57.515 --> 47:00.787
Who are you
and where are you taking me?

47:00.822 --> 47:04.093
-Gotcha!

47:05.864 --> 47:08.491
Seriously, it's been
a great day so far.

47:08.527 --> 47:12.535
We got two new residents
and they're both men.

47:12.571 --> 47:14.700
Oh, so you're not married.

47:14.736 --> 47:16.204
Not currently.

47:16.239 --> 47:18.836
But check back with me in a week
and I'll let ya know.

47:23.313 --> 47:25.782
So are you meeting
some of your girlfriends
for lunch?

47:25.817 --> 47:29.312
I'm meeting my boyfriend
for happy hour!

47:29.348 --> 47:31.714
Wow.
Well, he's a very lucky guy.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.772
This is for you.

47:57.846 --> 48:00.141
This is so beautiful.

48:00.177 --> 48:02.209
Thanks so much.

48:02.245 --> 48:05.918
And if things
don't work out at lunch,
I may have to call you later.

48:05.954 --> 48:07.882
Have a good time.

48:18.195 --> 48:19.498
-Hey.
-Hey.

48:24.945 --> 48:29.805
It is bigger and better
than I had ever imagined.

48:31.547 --> 48:32.610
What?

48:33.582 --> 48:35.178
Babe!

48:35.213 --> 48:37.280
-Oh, my God.
-Ah, ah.

48:37.315 --> 48:40.118
Let's go in the backyard, okay.

48:40.153 --> 48:42.085
I'll tell you all about it.

48:42.121 --> 48:43.291
-Okay?

48:52.498 --> 48:56.907
Okay, so anytime
you give anybody anything,

48:56.942 --> 49:00.441
it magically comes back to you
ten times?

49:00.477 --> 49:01.810
Yep.

49:01.845 --> 49:04.280
Passengers, homeless people,

49:04.315 --> 49:07.678
random strangers on the sidewalk
or in parking lots, anyone.

49:09.347 --> 49:12.615
But did it work with money too?

49:12.651 --> 49:15.026
I didn't have any on me,
but I'm sure it will.

49:16.252 --> 49:17.927
Hopefully.

49:17.962 --> 49:19.423
But I think
that we should try it

49:19.458 --> 49:21.692
before we go in
for the big score again.

49:22.862 --> 49:24.167
Copy.

49:28.035 --> 49:29.797
Mm! I almost forgot.

49:29.833 --> 49:32.472
That guy Frank called
and your car's ready.

49:35.939 --> 49:39.017
-Jeff, what is happening?
How are you?
-Frank.

49:39.947 --> 49:40.981
Life is great.

49:41.016 --> 49:42.911
Life is great?
Wunderbar!

49:42.946 --> 49:45.946
You should put
the "Life is Great"
on a shirt.

49:45.982 --> 49:48.521
-There's an idea.
-Yeah, let me show you your car.

50:02.839 --> 50:04.171
I thought it was fixed.

50:04.206 --> 50:06.835
It is,
but it's not what you thought.

50:06.871 --> 50:09.881
You thought your engine
was blocked and locked up.

50:09.916 --> 50:12.146
It wasn't.
You had plenty of engine oil.

50:12.181 --> 50:14.545
We had a simple
fuel system cleaning.

50:14.580 --> 50:17.045
That took care of it.
You're good to go.

50:17.081 --> 50:18.122
Wow.

50:18.918 --> 50:20.454
Thanks.

50:20.490 --> 50:22.387
But so you know,
I don't know what
any of that means

50:22.422 --> 50:24.857
that you just told me
about my car.

50:24.893 --> 50:26.491
Except that...

50:26.526 --> 50:28.792
you could have ripped me off
and charged me

50:28.827 --> 50:32.064
for a big repair
that I didn't need,
but instead...

50:32.099 --> 50:33.803
you looked out for me.

50:33.838 --> 50:35.798
-Thanks.
-It's not about me.

50:35.834 --> 50:38.306
If I take care of you,
I've got a business model.

50:38.341 --> 50:40.903
It's all about you.
Let's get you checked out.

51:11.571 --> 51:14.112
Would you mind
sitting in the back seat?

51:24.985 --> 51:26.256
Let's go!

51:30.288 --> 51:31.629
Do you hear me?

51:31.664 --> 51:34.091
-We gotta hurry!
-Yep.

51:34.126 --> 51:35.331
On our way.

51:40.666 --> 51:42.932
Should I ask
why you're in such a hurry?

51:45.407 --> 51:48.976
I just knocked out
my stupid boyfriend.

51:49.011 --> 51:51.405
And I stole his drugs.

51:53.449 --> 51:55.813
Well, that's something
I don't hear every day.

51:57.651 --> 51:59.817
I wouldn't even know
how to knock someone out.

52:02.259 --> 52:07.124
Well, it's easy
when you got one of these.

52:10.799 --> 52:11.829
Wow.

52:12.968 --> 52:14.304
That's a big gun.

52:18.005 --> 52:19.573
Oh, damn!

52:21.042 --> 52:22.945
Something wrong?

52:22.980 --> 52:25.641
I forgot my damn ChapStick!

52:25.677 --> 52:27.578
Oh, um, I can help you
with that.

52:27.613 --> 52:29.514
I-- I think I have some
in my bag here.

52:29.549 --> 52:31.279
-Hold on a second here.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.756
Watch it!

52:32.792 --> 52:34.451
Are you trying to kill us?

52:34.486 --> 52:37.085
Yeah, sorry.
Um... sorry.

52:38.024 --> 52:39.426
Here.

52:39.462 --> 52:42.332
Just take the bag.
You can find it yourself.

52:55.072 --> 52:57.872
-Did you find what
you were looking for?
-Yes.

52:57.907 --> 53:00.312
I can't live
without my ChapStick.

53:00.347 --> 53:03.480
Glad you had the good stuff.

53:03.515 --> 53:08.358
So, what else you got up there?

53:10.190 --> 53:11.856
You got any money?

53:13.998 --> 53:17.159
Here, take whatever you want.

53:17.195 --> 53:18.368
Oh.

53:29.408 --> 53:30.776
All right, here we are.

53:49.596 --> 53:53.095
So, did you really
pee your pants?

53:54.399 --> 53:55.801
Yeah, a little.

53:58.809 --> 54:00.069
Anyway...

54:01.742 --> 54:04.173
I have a coworker
that also drives for U-Lift,

54:04.208 --> 54:08.016
and he tells me
the craziest stories
about passengers.

54:08.051 --> 54:09.717
Yeah, involving guns?

54:09.753 --> 54:11.078
No.

54:11.114 --> 54:13.450
Which means that
this was probably just a one-off

54:13.485 --> 54:15.018
and won't happen again.

54:15.054 --> 54:17.958
Did you have any problems
with your other passengers?

54:17.994 --> 54:19.595
Didn't have any.

54:19.630 --> 54:23.593
Just drove around
for the rest of the day
and jammed out.

54:23.628 --> 54:25.534
Can we just change the subject?

54:26.932 --> 54:29.505
Okay, do you know
what you're gonna give next?

54:32.304 --> 54:34.072
Not really.

54:34.108 --> 54:36.938
-Do you think
you'll wanna drive tomorrow?
-Okay, stop, please.

54:36.973 --> 54:39.414
I feel like
you're interrogating me.

54:39.449 --> 54:41.916
Let me just go get the stuff
from the car.

54:41.951 --> 54:43.387
Can I help?

54:47.960 --> 54:50.387
Sam, we-- we have a problem.

54:50.423 --> 54:51.755
What? What happened?

54:51.790 --> 54:53.758
I went to get the stuff
out of the car,

54:53.794 --> 54:57.164
and I opened up the back,
and it was empty.

54:57.199 --> 55:01.402
I gave that lady a whole bag
of stuff and I didn't get
anything in return.

55:01.437 --> 55:03.937
Shit.
Am I losing the magic already?

55:03.973 --> 55:05.440
It's okay.

55:05.475 --> 55:07.570
There's gotta be
some kind of explanation.

55:07.605 --> 55:09.478
Let's just talk it out.

55:09.513 --> 55:11.773
What happened differently
with this passenger?

55:11.808 --> 55:14.108
Well, there were multiple items.

55:14.143 --> 55:15.953
But we did that
with the homeless man, so.

55:15.988 --> 55:18.322
Can you think of anything else?

55:18.358 --> 55:21.157
Um, she was in the car
when I gave her the stuff,

55:21.193 --> 55:23.493
but, well,
we've done that before.

55:25.160 --> 55:26.356
So that's not it.

55:26.391 --> 55:28.564
Okay, relax.

55:29.297 --> 55:30.731
There's no pressure.

55:31.333 --> 55:33.030
I think I know what it is.

55:34.536 --> 55:38.508
I didn't actually give her
anything.

55:38.543 --> 55:41.034
I thought you said she took,
like, two bags of stuff.

55:41.070 --> 55:43.178
That's just it,
she-- she took it.

55:43.213 --> 55:45.180
I didn't give her anything.

55:45.215 --> 55:47.042
I put the bags in the back seat

55:47.077 --> 55:49.277
and said she could take
whatever she wanted.

55:50.548 --> 55:52.049
I think that's it.

55:59.394 --> 56:01.390
Hey, I came as quick as I could.

56:01.426 --> 56:02.898
What's up?

56:02.934 --> 56:04.199
What is that?

56:04.234 --> 56:06.197
This all made sense at the time.

56:06.232 --> 56:08.868
Babe, I don't know
what you're thinking
unless you talk to me.

56:10.007 --> 56:11.700
Think about it.

56:11.736 --> 56:14.541
I was... shit out of luck.

56:14.576 --> 56:16.739
Every day
my life was getting worse.

56:16.774 --> 56:19.016
Not counting you, of course.

56:19.051 --> 56:20.848
And then I met the homeless guy.

56:20.884 --> 56:25.318
I gave him $20 and I find $200
in the front seat of the car.

56:25.353 --> 56:27.320
And I get to keep it.

56:27.355 --> 56:29.656
Then I gave him lunch,

56:29.692 --> 56:32.386
and we scored
all those big bags of groceries.

56:32.422 --> 56:35.389
So we're thinking
he must be my lucky charm,
right?

56:36.233 --> 56:38.165
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

56:38.201 --> 56:39.397
But then I lost him.

56:39.433 --> 56:40.765
Then Mom showed up.

56:40.801 --> 56:43.898
And she said
that it wasn't him at all.

56:43.933 --> 56:45.504
It had nothing to do with him.

56:45.539 --> 56:48.446
She said it was instant karma.

56:50.646 --> 56:52.242
So we drove around
the rest of that day

56:52.277 --> 56:55.351
and we gave drinks and money
to a different homeless person.

56:55.386 --> 56:58.583
Turns out...
it was instant karma.

56:58.618 --> 56:59.956
Sounds good to me.

56:59.991 --> 57:01.459
Of course it does.

57:02.294 --> 57:04.352
Then I gave the mayor
a pack of gum.

57:04.387 --> 57:07.257
I find ten packs of gum
in the back seat of the car.

57:07.293 --> 57:09.890
I met that really nice old lady,
gave her that beautiful scarf.

57:09.925 --> 57:11.392
And so on and so forth

57:11.427 --> 57:14.469
until the back seat of the car
is filled with stuff.

57:14.505 --> 57:16.565
Ten times as much
as I had given away.

57:16.601 --> 57:18.100
It was so fun.

57:18.135 --> 57:22.276
Until I gave that stuff
to the crazy lady.

57:22.311 --> 57:24.941
No, she took that stuff.

57:24.976 --> 57:27.112
And I didn't get anything
in return.

57:27.814 --> 57:30.711
Okay,
so if it's not instant karma,

57:30.747 --> 57:31.852
then what is it?

57:33.424 --> 57:35.449
I think it must be
your friend's car.

57:36.093 --> 57:37.121
Think about it.

57:37.997 --> 57:39.153
Before that showed up,

57:39.189 --> 57:41.098
I was on the worst string
of bad luck.

57:41.133 --> 57:42.566
You were ready to leave me.

57:42.601 --> 57:45.267
And you probably should have
if things didn't change.

57:45.302 --> 57:48.131
But they did change, big time...

57:48.166 --> 57:51.232
as soon as I started driving
your friend's car.

57:51.268 --> 57:53.233
And then when I tried
to do the same things

57:53.268 --> 57:55.678
while driving my car,
it didn't work.

57:57.016 --> 57:58.613
I think you're right.

57:58.648 --> 58:01.447
But why would Kumar
give me a magical car?

58:01.482 --> 58:02.948
I don't know.

58:02.984 --> 58:05.483
I think what we need
to do first is test this out

58:05.519 --> 58:07.190
to see if I'm right.

58:07.225 --> 58:09.922
And then we need to make a plan

58:09.957 --> 58:12.488
on how to maximize
using this while we have it.

58:12.523 --> 58:13.696
Yeah.

58:16.801 --> 58:20.835
So, did you go to church much
when you were growing up?

58:21.499 --> 58:23.039
Yep.

58:23.075 --> 58:25.041
Sorry to hear that.

58:25.076 --> 58:26.200
What do you mean?

58:26.235 --> 58:29.370
Well, I've heard
so many horror stories

58:29.405 --> 58:33.282
of people who were
earnestly searching for God

58:33.317 --> 58:35.713
and got totally turned off.

58:35.748 --> 58:38.616
Some were even hurt or abused.

58:38.651 --> 58:39.818
Oh, none of that for me.

58:39.853 --> 58:41.783
I just lost interest
in high school.

58:41.819 --> 58:43.220
I discovered girls.

58:43.986 --> 58:46.293
Well, that'll happen.

58:46.328 --> 58:48.327
And how about now?

58:48.363 --> 58:51.194
Um, you know,

58:51.229 --> 58:54.732
I guess I just try to live
by the golden rule.

58:54.767 --> 58:56.874
"Do unto others" and all that.

58:56.909 --> 58:58.233
Like karma.

58:58.268 --> 59:01.241
Give to others
and receive gifts in return.

59:01.277 --> 59:03.313
That's all good.

59:03.349 --> 59:06.707
"Give and you will be
given to."

59:06.742 --> 59:07.982
Exactly.

59:08.918 --> 59:11.314
Hey, you know what,
let me show you how it works.

59:19.296 --> 59:21.456
Hey, come here a second.

59:29.141 --> 59:30.864
Okay, you got a deal.

59:30.899 --> 59:32.440
Who's first?

59:32.475 --> 59:34.607
Uh, no, you have the wrong idea.

59:34.642 --> 59:36.177
You don't have to do anything.

59:36.213 --> 59:37.472
That's a gift.

59:40.579 --> 59:41.817
Thank you.

59:44.118 --> 59:47.020
I was a little nervous
for a bit there, young man.

59:48.054 --> 59:50.419
I was little worried
about this.

59:59.805 --> 1:00:01.804
Well, it's clear that
you only reached out to me

1:00:01.839 --> 1:00:04.369
so that you could have someone
to beat up on in tennis.

1:00:04.405 --> 1:00:07.041
Well, I always remember you
being better than me
in college, so.

1:00:07.076 --> 1:00:10.544
Okay, then either one of us
hasn't played much since then,

1:00:10.579 --> 1:00:12.381
or one of us has played a lot.

1:00:12.416 --> 1:00:14.541
-Or maybe both.

1:00:14.577 --> 1:00:16.979
Anyways, thank you
for letting me beat up on you

1:00:17.014 --> 1:00:19.121
and being a good sport about it.

1:00:19.157 --> 1:00:20.515
Of course, man.

1:00:21.359 --> 1:00:22.622
This has been a lot of fun.

1:00:22.657 --> 1:00:24.387
I can't remember the last time

1:00:24.422 --> 1:00:26.991
that I had some guy time
since I started dating Sam.

1:00:27.026 --> 1:00:28.924
Yeah, it's been a while
for me also.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:30.666
It's great to catch up.

1:00:30.701 --> 1:00:32.597
You know,
I never would have pegged you

1:00:32.633 --> 1:00:34.638
for a U-Lift driver.

1:00:34.674 --> 1:00:36.930
But it sounds like
it's working out for you, so...

1:00:36.965 --> 1:00:38.302
that's cool.

1:00:40.274 --> 1:00:43.011
Yeah, and I'm really sorry
to hear about your mom's cancer.

1:00:44.214 --> 1:00:47.449
Yeah, well, at least
she's getting great care
here at the clinic, so.

1:00:47.484 --> 1:00:48.917
That's all you can hope for.

1:00:49.950 --> 1:00:51.649
But I hear
that's really expensive.

1:00:51.685 --> 1:00:53.522
How's her insurance?

1:00:53.558 --> 1:00:55.625
Let's just say
it's not the best,

1:00:55.661 --> 1:00:58.223
but I'm working on a way
to supplement it, so.

1:01:00.022 --> 1:01:01.259
I'm glad to hear.

1:01:02.897 --> 1:01:05.326
Well, this has been
a lot of fun.

1:01:05.361 --> 1:01:07.098
The beer drinking part,
not so much

1:01:07.133 --> 1:01:09.633
getting my ass kicked
on the tennis court.

1:01:09.669 --> 1:01:10.970
But I gotta run.

1:01:11.006 --> 1:01:13.110
Let's get together again
while you're in town.

1:01:13.145 --> 1:01:14.806
Yeah, definitely.

1:01:14.841 --> 1:01:16.879
And let me pay for the beers.

1:01:21.385 --> 1:01:23.312
It's only $1,000, but...

1:01:23.347 --> 1:01:25.316
I want you to have that
to help your mom.

1:01:25.351 --> 1:01:27.789
-Dude, I can't take your money.
-Don't worry about it.

1:01:27.824 --> 1:01:29.857
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1:01:29.892 --> 1:01:31.729
And don't even worry
about paying me back.

1:01:47.174 --> 1:01:49.907
You know that karma's
spelled with a K, right?

1:01:49.942 --> 1:01:52.880
Yeah, but we have a magic car.

1:01:52.915 --> 1:01:56.015
-So I had it made with a C.
-Oh.

1:01:56.050 --> 1:02:00.486
I love you in pink,
but this is really pink.

1:02:00.522 --> 1:02:02.317
Yeah, I know.

1:02:02.352 --> 1:02:04.694
It was the only color
they had left.

1:02:04.729 --> 1:02:07.061
Maybe it'll fade
if I wash it a couple times.

1:02:16.938 --> 1:02:21.268
Wow, that shirt sure is pink!

1:02:21.304 --> 1:02:23.243
You get it at Goodwill?

1:02:23.278 --> 1:02:26.072
First time I see you in a month
and now you're a comedian?

1:02:26.108 --> 1:02:27.574
What can I say?

1:02:27.609 --> 1:02:30.018
I'm trying to expand
on my comedic signage.

1:02:31.290 --> 1:02:32.680
Speaking of which...

1:02:33.821 --> 1:02:35.458
What if I could change things?

1:02:35.493 --> 1:02:37.622
For you and Jennifer Aniston?

1:02:37.658 --> 1:02:39.093
Are you serious?

1:02:40.562 --> 1:02:41.689
Tell me more.

1:02:42.728 --> 1:02:44.299
Not here.

1:02:44.335 --> 1:02:45.528
Can I get in?

1:02:56.247 --> 1:02:57.441
Where to?

1:03:26.973 --> 1:03:28.905
Thanks for bringing me here.

1:03:28.940 --> 1:03:31.447
I love this place.

1:03:31.483 --> 1:03:33.781
It's a beautiful stadium.

1:03:33.817 --> 1:03:35.914
Have you ever been
to a game here?

1:03:35.950 --> 1:03:37.921
I wish.
I never had the money.

1:03:39.691 --> 1:03:43.157
When I was a kid
growing up in Chicago,

1:03:43.192 --> 1:03:46.358
my dad used to take me
to Wrigley Field all the time.

1:03:47.900 --> 1:03:51.264
I even used to dream
about playing for the Cubs.

1:03:52.864 --> 1:03:56.830
Can I ask you something
that I should have asked you
a long time ago?

1:03:57.835 --> 1:03:59.308
Harry.

1:03:59.344 --> 1:04:00.944
Harry Swayne.

1:04:02.978 --> 1:04:05.273
How'd you know
I was gonna ask that?

1:04:05.308 --> 1:04:07.182
No one ever asks me my name.

1:04:08.251 --> 1:04:11.449
Well, like I said,
I've been meaning to ask
for a long time.

1:04:12.214 --> 1:04:13.550
Sorry, Harry.

1:04:15.486 --> 1:04:18.520
I'm also curious--
why did you disappear

1:04:18.555 --> 1:04:20.964
after the last time
I gave you the money?

1:04:21.863 --> 1:04:23.694
You're not going to like it.

1:04:24.530 --> 1:04:26.901
Well, why not?
You think I'll be upset
that you...

1:04:26.936 --> 1:04:29.401
spent it on booze,
drugs, and women?

1:04:30.037 --> 1:04:32.140
I wish.
Never had the chance.

1:04:33.037 --> 1:04:34.406
What do you mean?

1:04:35.945 --> 1:04:38.976
One of the guys
on the corner that day

1:04:39.011 --> 1:04:41.012
saw you give me the cash

1:04:41.047 --> 1:04:43.877
and told a few of his friends.

1:04:44.919 --> 1:04:47.315
I-- I tried to downplay it

1:04:47.350 --> 1:04:49.759
and act like it was no big deal,

1:04:49.794 --> 1:04:53.095
but when I left,
three guys followed me,

1:04:54.025 --> 1:04:55.460
jumped me, and...

1:04:56.699 --> 1:04:58.100
beat the shit outta me.

1:04:59.196 --> 1:05:00.828
And took all the money.

1:05:03.740 --> 1:05:06.375
And even worse, all my signs.

1:05:06.411 --> 1:05:08.308
Sons of bitches.

1:05:09.107 --> 1:05:10.607
Don't be mad at 'em.

1:05:11.649 --> 1:05:13.742
It's just how it is out here.

1:05:13.777 --> 1:05:18.382
And... anyways, I spent
a few weeks in the hospital.

1:05:18.418 --> 1:05:21.420
Then they got me
into a rehab center to recover.

1:05:23.928 --> 1:05:25.955
I'm just getting back to work
this week.

1:05:27.594 --> 1:05:29.525
I'm glad you mentioned that.
I've always been curious.

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:32.429
How does that work?
Do you have to clock in?

1:05:32.464 --> 1:05:34.797
-Do you get to pick your corner

1:05:34.832 --> 1:05:37.373
or do you have like a supervisor
who assigns those to you?

1:05:37.409 --> 1:05:38.809
You're funny.

1:05:38.844 --> 1:05:41.374
I should get your help
with my new signs.

1:05:43.346 --> 1:05:46.709
Seriously,
what if I could help you
with your sign today?

1:05:48.111 --> 1:05:51.613
If you can get Jennifer Aniston
to go out with me,
sure, I'm down.

1:05:51.649 --> 1:05:54.421
Well, I don't know
if I have that much money.

1:05:54.456 --> 1:05:57.484
But what if I did have enough
to get you off the streets?

1:05:57.519 --> 1:05:59.561
At least for a little while.

1:05:59.596 --> 1:06:00.855
That'll work too.

1:06:01.860 --> 1:06:02.956
Okay.

1:06:14.469 --> 1:06:15.974
Fiesta Town Apartments.

1:06:16.010 --> 1:06:18.343
They're close by to here.

1:06:18.378 --> 1:06:21.249
I looked 'em up online
and they seem okay.

1:06:22.547 --> 1:06:24.651
They have
fully furnished apartments.

1:06:24.686 --> 1:06:27.417
You can get a six-month lease,
and that should give you
enough time

1:06:27.453 --> 1:06:31.525
to get back on your feet,
find a job.

1:06:32.361 --> 1:06:35.996
And if you need anything else,
you have my number.

1:06:36.032 --> 1:06:37.826
I'll even go to Goodwill
with you.

1:06:37.861 --> 1:06:40.602
We'll get you some blankets,
sheets, kitchen stuff.

1:06:40.637 --> 1:06:42.698
Whatever you need.

1:06:42.734 --> 1:06:45.298
Maybe we'll even find you
a cool shirt like this.

1:06:48.570 --> 1:06:50.944
I don't know what to say, man.

1:06:50.979 --> 1:06:52.676
You don't have to say anything.

1:06:53.751 --> 1:06:55.382
I've been in your shoes before.

1:06:57.051 --> 1:07:00.113
Well, not homeless, but...

1:07:00.148 --> 1:07:04.023
I did hit a string of bad luck
and someone helped me out.

1:07:04.058 --> 1:07:06.129
So I'm just paying it forward.

1:07:07.861 --> 1:07:09.396
Thanks, man.

1:07:10.768 --> 1:07:12.363
We'll have to come back here

1:07:12.398 --> 1:07:14.533
and go to a Cubs game
next season.

1:07:15.571 --> 1:07:17.036
Deal.

1:07:17.071 --> 1:07:19.206
I look forward to it, Harry.

1:07:19.241 --> 1:07:23.036
-Just don't wear that shirt.

1:07:41.530 --> 1:07:44.332
I just really don't like that
the money's just in the car.

1:07:45.530 --> 1:07:47.230
It's fine.
I parked right out front.

1:07:47.265 --> 1:07:49.401
No one's gonna take it.

1:07:49.436 --> 1:07:51.373
I don't know, I really think
you should just

1:07:51.408 --> 1:07:54.203
either do the next giveaway
or take it home or something.

1:07:54.238 --> 1:07:56.174
The next giveaway?

1:07:56.209 --> 1:07:58.247
-Already?
-Sure. Why not?

1:07:59.278 --> 1:08:01.415
We're gonna be millionaires.

1:08:02.313 --> 1:08:03.813
Well, that's the plan.

1:08:05.317 --> 1:08:07.055
All right, how about this?

1:08:07.090 --> 1:08:09.654
I'll take the money home,
hide it...

1:08:10.487 --> 1:08:12.686
but leave a little bit out

1:08:12.722 --> 1:08:14.526
so we can go
on a spending spree.

1:08:14.561 --> 1:08:18.196
That way, if we get
comfortable having money,

1:08:18.231 --> 1:08:19.698
maybe it won't feel as scary.

1:08:19.734 --> 1:08:20.764
Hmm.

1:08:22.234 --> 1:08:23.800
Yeah, I like that idea.

1:08:26.139 --> 1:08:28.772
I like that idea a lot.

<i>Looking at ourselves ♪</i>

1:10:25.697 --> 1:10:26.927
You need help?

1:10:26.963 --> 1:10:29.156
No, I got it.

1:10:40.210 --> 1:10:41.834
You can put that over here.

1:10:41.869 --> 1:10:43.041
-Right here?
-Yeah.

1:10:43.076 --> 1:10:44.206
Okay.

1:10:47.915 --> 1:10:49.409
Oh!

1:10:49.444 --> 1:10:51.113
Whoo!

1:10:51.149 --> 1:10:52.888
Oh!

1:10:52.923 --> 1:10:54.721
I can get used to this.

1:10:54.756 --> 1:10:57.093
Are you kidding me?
I'm ready to go back out
right now.

1:10:57.128 --> 1:10:59.886
No, we need to pace
ourselves, okay?

1:10:59.922 --> 1:11:02.224
-Do we have to?

1:11:02.259 --> 1:11:03.300
Mm-hmm.

1:11:07.070 --> 1:11:09.903
-Oh, sorry.
-Who is that?

1:11:09.939 --> 1:11:11.908
Eh, it's Emilio.

1:11:11.943 --> 1:11:13.442
I should probably get this.

1:11:16.672 --> 1:11:18.139
Hey, man, what's up?

1:11:19.409 --> 1:11:21.208
Um, no...

1:11:22.411 --> 1:11:23.452
Okay.

1:11:25.849 --> 1:11:27.557
All right, man,
I'll see you later.

1:11:27.592 --> 1:11:28.655
Okay.

1:11:29.828 --> 1:11:31.020
What was that all about?

1:11:34.694 --> 1:11:38.863
It's crazy,
but it might be perfect too.

1:11:40.663 --> 1:11:42.103
He's in a real bind.

1:11:42.138 --> 1:11:44.374
But... how is that perfect?

1:11:45.635 --> 1:11:49.711
Well, I can help him.

1:11:50.514 --> 1:11:55.748
And by helping him,
that could help us big time.

1:11:56.847 --> 1:11:59.845
Okay,
so you're Mr. Riddleman now?

1:11:59.881 --> 1:12:01.357
No, sorry, let me explain.

1:12:01.393 --> 1:12:04.094
So, when I saw Emilio,
he said that he had a plan

1:12:04.129 --> 1:12:06.156
to pay for his mom's
medical bills.

1:12:06.191 --> 1:12:07.428
Okay.

1:12:07.463 --> 1:12:09.656
It turns out that the plan
was to gamble

1:12:09.691 --> 1:12:10.824
and win the money.

1:12:10.859 --> 1:12:13.000
-Let me guess.
-Exactly.

1:12:13.035 --> 1:12:15.031
He lost, big time.

1:12:16.006 --> 1:12:17.198
So what does he want?

1:12:18.339 --> 1:12:20.436
Well, that's the crazy part.

1:12:20.471 --> 1:12:22.603
He needs $100,000.

1:12:22.639 --> 1:12:24.612
Right away, tonight.

1:12:27.078 --> 1:12:30.283
Does he need $100,000
for his mom's medical bills

1:12:30.318 --> 1:12:33.022
or for like a gambling thing?

1:12:33.057 --> 1:12:35.016
Says he needs it right away.

1:12:35.051 --> 1:12:37.993
I'm assuming the latter,
but I didn't ask.

1:12:38.029 --> 1:12:39.561
I just told him I'd help.

1:12:40.823 --> 1:12:43.323
He said he'd pay me back, but...

1:12:43.358 --> 1:12:45.864
I don't think he'll have to
because of the magic.

1:12:46.664 --> 1:12:50.707
Wow, this is crazy but perfect.

1:12:53.403 --> 1:12:54.939
Mm!

1:13:00.916 --> 1:13:02.045
Clint?

1:13:13.262 --> 1:13:14.827
I'll take that for you, sir.

1:13:19.267 --> 1:13:21.400
Welcome aboard, Clint.

1:13:21.435 --> 1:13:23.264
How's your day been so far?

1:13:24.239 --> 1:13:26.135
It's been a long day.

1:13:27.202 --> 1:13:29.738
At least I didn't have to
kill anyone, so.

1:13:29.774 --> 1:13:33.076
Yeah, right, me neither.

1:13:34.610 --> 1:13:36.715
I'm kidding.

1:13:36.751 --> 1:13:39.082
You do a lot of these
night shifts for U-Lift?

1:13:40.457 --> 1:13:43.125
Uh, not too many,
but I like the variety,

1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:45.121
so I do them every now and then.

1:13:46.129 --> 1:13:47.497
You should be careful.

1:13:48.726 --> 1:13:50.665
Crazies come out at night.

1:13:53.269 --> 1:13:54.801
Yeah, I know you said that

1:13:54.836 --> 1:13:57.433
you've had a long day,
but are you in a hurry now?

1:13:57.469 --> 1:13:58.767
That depends.

1:13:58.802 --> 1:14:01.241
Can you make it worth my while?

1:14:01.276 --> 1:14:03.645
Probably not.

1:14:04.909 --> 1:14:06.547
I have a buddy
who lives along the way

1:14:06.583 --> 1:14:09.583
and I have a bag
that I need to drop off to him.

1:14:09.618 --> 1:14:12.318
Would you mind if we stopped
on the way?

1:14:12.353 --> 1:14:13.985
Shouldn't be a problem.

1:14:15.453 --> 1:14:16.691
Thank you.

1:14:31.700 --> 1:14:32.905
You got it?

1:14:34.142 --> 1:14:35.303
Right here.

1:14:36.145 --> 1:14:37.278
The whole amount?

1:14:37.313 --> 1:14:39.075
Yeah, just like we talked about.

1:14:39.111 --> 1:14:41.411
Seriously, you have no idea
how much this means.

1:14:41.447 --> 1:14:43.352
Listen, I'll...

1:14:43.388 --> 1:14:46.523
Listen, I'll pay you back
every cent.

1:14:50.988 --> 1:14:52.918
Why'd you bring somebody,
though?

1:14:52.954 --> 1:14:54.855
Don't you trust me?

1:14:54.890 --> 1:14:56.263
Yeah, of course I do.

1:14:56.299 --> 1:14:57.957
He's just my U-Lift rider.

1:14:57.992 --> 1:14:59.096
Don't worry about it.

1:15:13.384 --> 1:15:16.812
See, I told you
that wouldn't take long.

1:15:16.847 --> 1:15:18.978
Easy peasy.
In and out.

1:15:19.013 --> 1:15:20.689
Bada bing, bada boom.

1:15:22.327 --> 1:15:24.187
Should I ask
what that was about?

1:15:25.359 --> 1:15:27.330
Please don't.

1:15:27.365 --> 1:15:30.790
I've got a U-Lift driver
who's a spy.

1:15:33.031 --> 1:15:36.505
But seriously, I could use
a guy like you.

1:15:36.540 --> 1:15:39.373
How'd you like to make
some extra money?

1:15:39.409 --> 1:15:42.403
Um, no, thanks.
Um, I'm good.

1:15:50.287 --> 1:15:51.918
I'll grab your bag for you, sir.

1:16:13.873 --> 1:16:16.107
For making my ride
entertaining, kid.

1:16:17.775 --> 1:16:19.275
Hope to see you around.

1:16:46.770 --> 1:16:48.134
-Surprise!
-Oh!

1:16:48.169 --> 1:16:50.538
Are you ready to celebrate?

1:16:50.573 --> 1:16:53.279
Well, don't you wanna see
what we're celebrating first?

1:16:55.282 --> 1:16:57.210
Sam...

1:16:57.245 --> 1:16:59.315
-We're millionaires.

1:17:04.358 --> 1:17:05.519
Oh, my gosh.

1:17:08.124 --> 1:17:10.628

Hey, It's a good thing
Kumar texted you

1:17:47.330 --> 1:17:49.968
to let you know
he's coming home tomorrow.

1:17:50.004 --> 1:17:52.972
I am so glad that we got
the money last night.

1:17:53.008 --> 1:17:56.240
-We're freakin' millionaires!
-Yeah!

1:17:58.014 --> 1:18:00.708
-Ugh,
it's probably my mom again.

1:18:00.743 --> 1:18:04.182
-What are you doing there?
-Don't worry about it.
I'm working.

1:18:13.427 --> 1:18:15.130
Who called?

1:18:15.166 --> 1:18:16.964
I'm not sure.

1:18:20.538 --> 1:18:23.003
<i>Jeff, this is Clint.</i>

1:18:23.038 --> 1:18:26.465
<i>Yeah, you remember giving me</i>
<i>a ride last night.</i>

1:18:26.501 --> 1:18:29.036
<i>You need to give me</i>
<i>my bag back now</i>

1:18:29.071 --> 1:18:31.544
<i>or you're in deep shit!</i>

1:18:31.579 --> 1:18:33.475
What's he talking about?

1:18:34.418 --> 1:18:37.312
I literally have no idea.

1:18:37.347 --> 1:18:39.646
He had one bag,
I put it in the hatchback,

1:18:39.681 --> 1:18:42.484
and then I gave it back to him
when I dropped him off.

1:18:44.057 --> 1:18:47.854
So you're positive
that you did not switch

1:18:47.889 --> 1:18:51.392
that dude's bag
with the giant bag of money
you brought home?

1:18:51.428 --> 1:18:54.267
I mean, the bags
looked similar, but, no, no, no.

1:18:54.303 --> 1:18:57.397
-There's no way
that I switched 'em.
-All right, Jeff, calm down.

1:18:57.432 --> 1:19:00.733
-Let's figure this out.

1:19:03.641 --> 1:19:04.876
Hello?

1:19:04.911 --> 1:19:07.444
<i>Did you get my message?</i>

1:19:07.479 --> 1:19:11.244
-There must be some mistake.
<i>-That's right, and you made it.</i>

1:19:11.279 --> 1:19:12.850
<i>You put my bag in your car.</i>

1:19:12.885 --> 1:19:14.555
<i>It had a million dollars in it.</i>

1:19:14.590 --> 1:19:17.690
<i>And now, my money's gone.</i>

1:19:17.725 --> 1:19:19.454
But I gave your bag back to you.

1:19:19.490 --> 1:19:22.555
<i>Listen, you little shit!</i>
<i>I'm not fucking around.</i>

1:19:22.590 --> 1:19:25.734
-I didn't do anything.
<i>-Quit lying to me.</i>

1:19:25.769 --> 1:19:28.195
<i>You're really starting</i>
<i>to piss me off.</i>

1:19:28.230 --> 1:19:30.036
<i>I know you have my money.</i>

1:19:30.072 --> 1:19:33.007
<i>I saw you looking at it</i>
<i>on the security camera.</i>

1:19:34.073 --> 1:19:38.212
Well-- well,
what if I don't have it?

1:19:38.248 --> 1:19:41.483
<i>If you don't have it,</i>
<i>then your little friend</i>
<i>Emilio here</i>

1:19:41.518 --> 1:19:43.650
<i>is in for a world of hurt.</i>

1:19:43.686 --> 1:19:47.384
<i>And then I'm coming after you.</i>

1:19:47.419 --> 1:19:50.716
<i>I've got Emilio at a warehouse</i>
<i>north of downtown.</i>

1:19:50.752 --> 1:19:54.226
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>
<i>Come around back.</i>

1:19:56.164 --> 1:20:00.061
<i>Bring me my fucking money</i>
<i>or you're both dead.</i>

1:20:00.096 --> 1:20:01.838
<i>You have two hours.</i>

1:20:03.364 --> 1:20:04.830
Put Emilio on the phone first.

1:20:04.865 --> 1:20:08.675
If you want your money.

1:20:08.710 --> 1:20:10.778
<i>Playing hardball, are ya?</i>

1:20:10.813 --> 1:20:12.175
If you want me
to bring you your money,

1:20:12.210 --> 1:20:14.246
I need to know
that Emilio's okay.

1:20:15.677 --> 1:20:17.744
<i> Oh, Jeff, Jeff,</i>
<i>you gotta help me.</i>

1:20:17.779 --> 1:20:19.818
<i>This guy's crazy.</i>
<i>Please, please, Jeff, just--</i>

1:20:21.722 --> 1:20:23.019
<i> Better hurry.</i>

1:20:23.055 --> 1:20:25.191
<i>I don't think he'll last long.</i>

1:20:27.465 --> 1:20:29.355
We've gotta get outta here.

1:20:29.390 --> 1:20:31.598
But we can't just leave Emilio.

1:20:31.633 --> 1:20:34.794
Did you hear that guy?

1:20:34.829 --> 1:20:37.472
Okay, before we do anything,
we have to figure out

1:20:37.507 --> 1:20:38.606
why this is happening.

1:20:38.641 --> 1:20:41.109
Everything was going so well.

1:20:41.144 --> 1:20:45.376
Maybe we messed up the magic
when we were cleaning the car?

1:21:02.496 --> 1:21:03.724
Ugh!

1:21:23.278 --> 1:21:24.748
Sam, where are you?

1:21:24.784 --> 1:21:26.285
I'm right here.

1:21:28.953 --> 1:21:30.523
What the hell?

1:21:30.559 --> 1:21:32.694
Just in case.

1:21:32.729 --> 1:21:35.459
-Have you lost your mind?
-No!

1:21:36.467 --> 1:21:38.228
I'm being practical.

1:21:38.263 --> 1:21:40.434
That guy sounds like
a total psycho.

1:21:40.470 --> 1:21:43.704
What's to stop him
from killing us both after
you give him the money?

1:21:43.739 --> 1:21:45.667
Okay, just stop for one second.

1:21:46.601 --> 1:21:48.437
You're right,
Clint is a psycho,

1:21:48.472 --> 1:21:51.572
but we have to at least try
to save Emilio.

1:21:51.608 --> 1:21:54.347
It's my fault
he got sucked into this anyway.

1:21:54.383 --> 1:21:57.679
And first we have to figure out
why all of this is happening.

1:22:01.822 --> 1:22:03.452
Do you recognize this?

1:22:03.487 --> 1:22:05.684
Yeah, it was in the car,
next to the console.

1:22:05.719 --> 1:22:08.025
I took it out
while we were cleaning.

1:22:08.060 --> 1:22:10.055
Do you have any idea what it is?

1:22:10.091 --> 1:22:11.429
No.

1:22:13.268 --> 1:22:17.133
It says that the statue
is the God Shani.

1:22:17.168 --> 1:22:20.801
And Shani is the God of Karma.

1:22:20.836 --> 1:22:26.475
Yeah, and Shani
is the most powerful
of all gods

1:22:26.510 --> 1:22:31.284
and has the power to reward
and to punish.

1:22:33.483 --> 1:22:35.717
So, this is the reason
for everything.

1:22:37.487 --> 1:22:39.926
It wasn't
Harry the homeless guy,

1:22:39.962 --> 1:22:42.625
or instant karma,
or even the car.

1:22:43.865 --> 1:22:47.168
It was Shani, the God of Karma.

1:22:51.466 --> 1:22:52.833
Maybe he got away.

1:22:54.509 --> 1:22:56.475
Emilio?

1:22:56.510 --> 1:22:59.477
<i> Emilio's a little</i>
<i>under the weather right now.</i>

1:23:01.547 --> 1:23:05.346
Clint, you better not
have done anything to him.

1:23:05.381 --> 1:23:08.088
He has nothing to do with this.

1:23:08.123 --> 1:23:10.651
Okay, it was a mistake,
a misunderstanding.

1:23:10.687 --> 1:23:13.793
I'm on my way right now
to make things right.

1:23:13.828 --> 1:23:15.531
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

1:23:15.566 --> 1:23:17.693
<i>You have one hour left.</i>

1:23:19.496 --> 1:23:21.368
-I have to go.
-Let me come with you.

1:23:21.404 --> 1:23:22.566
-No.

1:23:23.632 --> 1:23:25.437
I'm not letting you go
by yourself.

1:23:43.089 --> 1:23:44.885
Should we bring the money?

1:23:47.591 --> 1:23:49.626
I think we should leave it
here for now.

1:24:27.734 --> 1:24:28.995
Emilio!

1:24:47.725 --> 1:24:49.788
Well, well, well.

1:24:49.823 --> 1:24:51.292
Hello, Jeff.

1:24:56.396 --> 1:24:58.898
You son of a bitch.
Why are you doing this?

1:24:58.933 --> 1:25:00.099
He didn't do anything!

1:25:00.135 --> 1:25:02.796
You're right.
But you know what?

1:25:02.831 --> 1:25:05.939
He had to pay 10% interest
on your loan.

1:25:05.974 --> 1:25:08.239
Which he was unwilling to do

1:25:08.275 --> 1:25:10.779
until I applied
a little pressure.

1:25:10.814 --> 1:25:13.079
What the hell is wrong with you?

1:25:13.115 --> 1:25:17.947
Jeff, you stole
my fucking money!

1:25:20.452 --> 1:25:23.522
Hey,
who's your little friend there?

1:25:25.653 --> 1:25:27.196
You leave her out of this.

1:25:28.790 --> 1:25:30.892
Then why the fuck
did you bring her?

1:25:32.365 --> 1:25:35.735
You know what?
Don't answer that.

1:25:35.771 --> 1:25:37.206
Glad she's here.

1:25:40.974 --> 1:25:42.244
Oh, no!

1:25:43.175 --> 1:25:45.643
-No!

1:26:09.235 --> 1:26:10.932
What are you gonna do to us?

1:26:15.307 --> 1:26:17.103
Well, it depends.

1:26:18.815 --> 1:26:20.782
Did you bring my money?

1:26:20.817 --> 1:26:22.515
-Oh...
-No.

1:26:24.983 --> 1:26:26.112
No?

1:26:30.322 --> 1:26:32.052
No, we didn't bring the money.

1:26:36.424 --> 1:26:37.563
We hid it.

1:26:38.703 --> 1:26:40.236
So if you kill us...

1:26:41.530 --> 1:26:43.201
you'll never find it.

1:26:43.237 --> 1:26:45.365
-No, no!

1:26:45.401 --> 1:26:46.803
Listen!

1:26:52.410 --> 1:26:53.876
We'll trade you the money.

1:26:56.918 --> 1:26:58.254
For our lives.

1:26:59.789 --> 1:27:00.949
All three of us.

1:27:03.754 --> 1:27:07.728
So you give me my money
and I let you go.

1:27:07.764 --> 1:27:09.056
Is that right?

1:27:10.633 --> 1:27:11.828
No.

1:27:14.232 --> 1:27:15.502
You let us go,

1:27:17.305 --> 1:27:19.165
and then
I'll bring you the money.

1:27:25.046 --> 1:27:27.415
Do you think I'm stupid?

1:27:29.545 --> 1:27:30.913
No, I don't.

1:27:31.816 --> 1:27:33.749
But I can clearly see
that you're a tough guy,

1:27:33.784 --> 1:27:38.184
so I'm appealing
to your sense of fair play.

1:27:40.061 --> 1:27:41.594
Just give us a chance.

1:27:42.666 --> 1:27:43.992
I promise,

1:27:44.900 --> 1:27:46.302
if you let us go,

1:27:48.062 --> 1:27:51.100
I will promise that you get
your money.

1:27:51.136 --> 1:27:52.637
Fair play?

1:27:52.673 --> 1:27:56.642
You want me to trust you
after you stole my money?

1:27:58.816 --> 1:28:02.609
Okay, sure.

1:28:02.644 --> 1:28:04.386
Tell you what I'll do.

1:28:08.155 --> 1:28:09.721
On one piece of paper

1:28:11.092 --> 1:28:13.219
I'll write "Let you go."

1:28:21.168 --> 1:28:22.470
And on the other...

1:28:23.630 --> 1:28:24.868
"Kill you."

1:28:39.123 --> 1:28:41.750
And you pick
which piece of paper.

1:28:41.786 --> 1:28:45.185
That way, you decide
what I do to you.

1:28:46.456 --> 1:28:47.924
Now choose one.

1:28:52.902 --> 1:28:54.227
Untie me first.

1:28:55.973 --> 1:28:59.807
Okay, but no funny business.

1:29:12.146 --> 1:29:14.879
All right, but you--
you have to promise

1:29:14.915 --> 1:29:16.392
to be a man of your word.

1:29:18.086 --> 1:29:20.462
If I choose the one
that says "Let you go,"

1:29:21.998 --> 1:29:23.355
you have to let us go.

1:29:25.225 --> 1:29:30.065
Oh, Jeff, I cross my heart
and hope to die.

1:29:55.966 --> 1:29:57.466
What are you doing?

1:29:59.632 --> 1:30:01.665
You said that you wrote
"Kill you"

1:30:01.700 --> 1:30:03.769
and "Let you go" on the papers,
right?

1:30:05.033 --> 1:30:07.476
Well, let's see
which one's left...

1:30:08.639 --> 1:30:10.072
and we'll know what I chose.

1:30:11.046 --> 1:30:12.646
You little shit!

1:30:16.476 --> 1:30:18.877
It looks like I chose the one
that said "Let you go,"

1:30:18.913 --> 1:30:21.182
so you have to let us go.

1:30:22.654 --> 1:30:25.119
I'm not letting you go!

1:30:25.154 --> 1:30:29.465
-Don't let them get away!

1:30:31.730 --> 1:30:33.766
I'll be back for you later.

1:30:42.077 --> 1:30:43.636
Go, go, go, go!

1:30:51.014 --> 1:30:53.951
-You see 'em?
-Yes, I see them!

1:30:59.328 --> 1:31:00.961
-They're still there.
-Shit.

1:31:07.862 --> 1:31:09.167
Keep close.

1:31:09.202 --> 1:31:10.330
Step on it.

1:31:13.201 --> 1:31:15.735
-Can we go any faster?
-I'm trying! I...

1:31:15.771 --> 1:31:17.403
Let's go, catch up.

1:31:21.143 --> 1:31:24.047
-You're driving like your mom!
-Oh, my God.

1:31:26.182 --> 1:31:28.689
-I'll go up there.
-Take it. Take it, take it!

1:31:42.867 --> 1:31:44.705
I don't even know
where this goes.

1:31:48.544 --> 1:31:52.006
-No, no, no, no.
-Shit. Uh...

1:31:52.041 --> 1:31:54.550
-It's okay, just turn around.
-Yeah.

1:32:03.757 --> 1:32:05.786
Oh, my God,
I think we lost 'em.

1:32:05.821 --> 1:32:07.453
Where are they?

1:32:09.498 --> 1:32:11.290
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!
What do we do?

1:32:11.325 --> 1:32:13.701
-What do we do? What do we do?
-Sam, run!

1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:23.570
Come on.

1:32:35.588 --> 1:32:37.626
There's nowhere left to go.

1:32:42.058 --> 1:32:44.088
That was a good one
back there--

1:32:44.124 --> 1:32:45.931
eating the fucking paper.

1:32:46.731 --> 1:32:48.461
I didn't see that coming.

1:32:49.469 --> 1:32:52.168
But now your time is up.

1:32:53.576 --> 1:32:56.342
If you both come out
with your hands up,

1:32:56.378 --> 1:32:58.471
I might let one of you go.

1:33:19.562 --> 1:33:20.768
Okay.

1:33:21.565 --> 1:33:22.704
Coming out.

1:33:31.005 --> 1:33:32.307
Don't shoot.

1:33:37.285 --> 1:33:40.121
-Oh!

1:33:40.156 --> 1:33:42.482
Where's my money?

1:33:42.517 --> 1:33:45.818
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

1:33:46.921 --> 1:33:52.091
Jeff, if we just-- we just
tell him where it is,
it'll be-- it'll be...

1:33:52.126 --> 1:33:53.669
He's gonna let us go, right?

1:33:54.865 --> 1:33:58.300
-Right?
-Okay.

1:33:59.602 --> 1:34:00.874
Okay.

1:34:02.211 --> 1:34:03.611
Okay, I'll...

1:34:03.646 --> 1:34:05.411
-I'll tell you where it is.
-Where is it?

1:34:05.446 --> 1:34:07.639
It's in the car.

1:34:09.349 --> 1:34:10.510
Let's go!

1:34:11.713 --> 1:34:12.886
Show me!

1:34:14.351 --> 1:34:16.617
-It's in the back of the car.
-I said let's go!

1:34:30.204 --> 1:34:31.997
Here.

1:34:32.033 --> 1:34:33.566
That wasn't so hard.

1:35:28.354 --> 1:35:30.062
Can you pop the trunk, please?

1:35:33.369 --> 1:35:34.569
You okay with this, sir?

1:35:34.605 --> 1:35:36.805
Yeah,
it should be fun.

1:35:54.753 --> 1:35:56.253
First ride share, huh?

1:35:56.984 --> 1:35:58.690
Yes, sir.

1:35:58.725 --> 1:36:00.758
What kind of work do you do?

1:36:00.793 --> 1:36:04.191
I used to sell books online.

1:36:04.227 --> 1:36:07.099
Now I sell
just about everything.

1:36:07.134 --> 1:36:11.169
I've probably bought
something from you... before.

1:36:16.910 --> 1:36:18.671
Let me help you
with your bag, sir.

1:36:27.147 --> 1:36:28.752
Here you are, sir.

1:36:28.787 --> 1:36:30.387
Thank you.

1:36:30.422 --> 1:36:33.620
-What about this one?
-It's not mine.
