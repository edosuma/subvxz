since you're here...

15:28.177 --> 15:30.054
I noticed you take a lot of notes...

15:30.930 --> 15:34.099
and seeing as we have
that big final test coming up,

15:35.392 --> 15:36.936
maybe we can study together.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.271
Yeah, I'd like that.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.983
-Come on, have I ever let you down?
-No, never. Wow.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.861
Hey, I've got to go. No disrespect.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.783
Owen, so long as we're studying together,
the coffee's on me.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.370
Why are you so warm?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.831
I have chronic hypothermia.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.126
My skin's temperature is 106 degrees.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.213
That's fucked up.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.009
I've gotta go.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.517
She's a long way from home.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.856
-[Annia] Yes, she is.
-As are you.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.609
How did she find you?

16:25.693 --> 16:26.902
How does anyone?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.655
I was drunk in a tavern.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.409
She was lost, and sick, and...

16:34.493 --> 16:36.412
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

16:36.495 --> 16:41.250
Does the princess know
the ranger she's chosen as her guide

16:41.333 --> 16:44.753
is hunted by invisible assassins

16:44.837 --> 16:46.922
sent by Queen Gertrude?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.633
I tell Her Highness
only what she needs to know.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.386
And who doesn't have a price
on their head these days?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.346
She stirs.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.144
Such grace.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.105
How can we repay your kindness?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.442
No need, my child. It is my pleasure.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.111
[Ellia] Did my guide
tell you of our quest?

17:09.653 --> 17:10.654
[Ellia coughs]

17:14.825 --> 17:16.493
We seek a mythical water...

17:17.036 --> 17:20.122
-that will cleanse me of my sickness.
-The Lake of the Clouds.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.915
You know it?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.668
I was cursed to die by my mother.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.962
I came from the Riverdale forest
near death,

17:27.337 --> 17:28.922
grasping at the legend.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.675
Now, by the grace of the gods,

17:32.259 --> 17:33.927
it seems to be coming true.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.139
My ranger's going to save me
from death itself.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.102
[Lady Nora] I know where it is,
and I can show you.

17:42.936 --> 17:43.937
[man groans]

17:45.064 --> 17:46.231
-Yurick.
-All right.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.192
Up, you idiot.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.027
I'm sorry, m'lady.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.030
I was lost in my own head again.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.406
-Fetch the mirror.
-[Ellia coughs]

17:54.490 --> 17:56.575
All right, right. Thank you, thank you.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.534
Who is he?

17:58.118 --> 17:59.119
My husband.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.455
[Yurick] Thank you.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.124
I'd like your ranger...

18:04.792 --> 18:08.128
to peer into this looking glass.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.755
[Ellia] That's it.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.091
What nature of looking glass is it?

18:12.174 --> 18:13.967
Magic, of course.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.012
So why not have the royal elf
look into it?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.973
[Lady Nora] The glass needs
only see one of you.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.017
Your fates are intertwined,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.186
and I am most interested...

18:25.020 --> 18:27.064
in your reflection.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.033
What do you see?

18:40.369 --> 18:41.245
I...

18:42.329 --> 18:43.664
[Ellia] What is it, Annia?

18:47.668 --> 18:48.752
It's two girls. Who are they?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.714
Sisters.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.885
The younger one is leaning forward.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.847
The elder one is putting rouge on her.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.683
I know this image. It's familiar. The younger one adores the older.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.191
They've heard their mother is coming home.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.236
So they're getting ready.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.614
But she's not really coming.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.242
It's you.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.377
And me.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.634
How can that be?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.345
Did I find you?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.308
Or were you supposed to find me?

19:54.526 --> 19:56.737
Follow the stars north,

19:56.820 --> 19:58.322
and within two days

19:58.405 --> 20:01.491
you'll reach the lightning‐struck shell
of an awin tree.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.410
You'll find the lake,

20:03.827 --> 20:07.789
so long as your eyes
and your hearts are clear.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.210
I wish you luck on your quest.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.461
Thank you.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.421
Thank you for your help.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.800
-Get up. Boil some water.
‐[Yurick] Yes, ma'am.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.555
Come, child.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.017
Though you may be cursed,

20:28.143 --> 20:29.645
you're still her eyes.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.692
You're Greg FUN Nazlund.

20:40.781 --> 20:41.615
Asshole.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.790
Goodbye. Fare thee well.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.629
She's very strange, that woman.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.008
Did you really, you know,
see all those things that you said--

21:02.302 --> 21:06.014
Did you really see all those things
you said you saw in there?

21:07.057 --> 21:07.975
Ellie...

21:08.058 --> 21:09.810
Ellie, it's me.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.813
Look at me. It's me, Annie.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.773
Yes, Annia.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.608
My ranger and my guide.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.153
Of course, of course, of course.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.239
It's fucking fantasy.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.865
[laughs]

21:24.283 --> 21:25.909
It's my least favorite genre.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.245
What is this?

21:28.328 --> 21:30.580
What does this mean?
What is this supposed to be?

21:30.664 --> 21:34.334
What does any tale mean?
My tutor used to ask me this.

21:34.793 --> 21:39.464
I have read many fascinating moral tales
in the archives of the palace.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.342
‐[scoffs] Man, you love this.
‐Do you understand?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.636
You love this. This is...

21:45.304 --> 21:47.597
‐[coughing]
‐This was your idea, wasn't it?

21:47.681 --> 21:49.391
What? All right, come on.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.101
Hey. Come on.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.269
You're okay. You're okay.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.319
[Mantleray] You're probably
conspiring against me.

22:01.611 --> 22:04.614
Turning my test subjects against me.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.663
How are the systems running?

22:11.747 --> 22:14.166
[Azumi] So far,
all the key indicators look perfect.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.501
Whatever she's doing is helping.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.297
Maybe your mother
doesn't destroy everything after all.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.465
How is she?

22:23.425 --> 22:24.634
She's breathing.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.391
I never apologized to you about the gala.

22:32.225 --> 22:35.729
You don't have to. The consequences
were simply the end of our romance.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.898
I'm sorry, Azumi.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.109
It was a way out.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.403
A way out...

22:43.987 --> 22:44.863
of what?

22:46.615 --> 22:47.449
Failure.

22:51.953 --> 22:54.122
This is the quietest I've ever seen her.
