WEBVTT

00:00.935 --> 00:02.601
(lightning crackling)

00:03.837 --> 00:06.738
(intro theme)

00:45.746 --> 00:48.346
(soft music)

00:48.348 --> 00:49.748
(horse neighs)

00:49.750 --> 00:52.417
- It's just so beautiful
in the country.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.686
I can't wait to enjoy it.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.355
- I thought you were
here to teach?

00:56.490 --> 00:59.024
- Well, my classes won't
take up that much time,

00:59.026 --> 01:01.292
And you'll be busy.
- Oh, yes.

01:01.328 --> 01:04.229
I can't wait to see the
long-distance transmission lines

01:04.298 --> 01:07.966
From niagara falls installed.
Mayor hahn will even be there.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.234
(laughs)
- well, make sure

01:09.236 --> 01:11.036
To write everything down
in detail,

01:11.105 --> 01:13.105
So you can read it to susannah
as a bedtime story.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.406
- Oh! Do you think she...

01:17.144 --> 01:18.209
That was a joke.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.512
Very funny.
- Oh!

01:25.185 --> 01:26.851
- Hm.
- Hm.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.022
(indistinct chatter)

01:31.658 --> 01:33.058
- With crabtree
on his honeymoon,

01:33.127 --> 01:35.394
Murdoch on vacation
and watts gone,

01:35.529 --> 01:37.796
This place is as quiet
as a church.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.799
- I wish I was paid enough
to afford a vacation.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.936
- Eh? What was that?
- Nothing, sir.

01:43.938 --> 01:48.006
- Right. I'm off.
Higgins, you're in charge.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.041
And I never thought
I'd hear myself say that.

01:51.679 --> 01:52.877
- Hm.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.012
<i> - Women treating women</i>

01:54.081 --> 01:56.348
Offers great benefit,
particularly in childbirth.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.216
However, it's important to know

01:58.252 --> 02:01.553
When to seek medical attention
for the mother, or the child.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.355
One possible scenario--

02:03.357 --> 02:05.290
- Please!
- Oh, dear god!

02:05.993 --> 02:07.626
- Please! Help him!

02:07.761 --> 02:08.993
- Put him on the table!

02:09.697 --> 02:11.129
Careful with his head.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.098
He's bleeding badly.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.434
You all right?

02:16.504 --> 02:17.535
Can you hear me?

02:18.305 --> 02:19.871
Can you tell me your name?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.640
What happened to him?

02:23.043 --> 02:25.510
- Oh... I found her.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.116
(indistinct whispering)

02:33.487 --> 02:34.453
He's gone.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.353
(dramatic music)

02:40.828 --> 02:41.927
- Was hit from behind.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.863
- It's a deep laceration,
likely caused

02:44.998 --> 02:47.098
By something heavy
and very sharp.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.067
The edge of a rock, perhaps?

02:49.136 --> 02:51.470
- Without a full post-mortem,
I couldn't say for sure.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.476
And what do you have there?

02:59.079 --> 03:02.480
- It's a letter addressed
to enoch snider.

03:04.084 --> 03:08.920
From an otto pfanschmidt
in lancaster, pennsylvania.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.489
- I'm guessing
this is enoch snider?

03:12.292 --> 03:13.825
- You say he was brought in?

03:13.961 --> 03:16.161
- Carried in by a
young man who ran off

03:16.296 --> 03:17.496
Before I could talk to him.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.098
- That was mervin friessen.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.134
He and his family come
into berlin every weekend.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.371
- And what about enoch snider?
Do you know him?

03:26.506 --> 03:28.440
- I've never seen him before.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.808
- Do you where we can find
mr. Friessen?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.278
- The friessen colony
is just up the road.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.646
- Colony?

03:34.715 --> 03:35.980
- They're mennonite.

03:36.984 --> 03:37.849
- Oh.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.252
- Excuse me.
I wonder if you could--

03:41.288 --> 03:42.988
- Excuse me? Could you tell me

03:43.057 --> 03:44.723
Where I could find
mervin friessen?

03:44.792 --> 03:45.923
- A quick question?

03:45.960 --> 03:47.025
- Oh!

03:51.331 --> 03:53.965
Oh! Hello.
- Hello.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.602
- Oh! Is that for me?
- Yes.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.272
- It's beautiful.
- Edna.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.208
Go back to your mother.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.615
(chuckles)
can I help you?

04:11.818 --> 04:14.085
- We're looking for
a mervin friessen.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.688
- He's my son. Who are you?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.757
- I'm william murdoch.
This is my wife,

04:18.826 --> 04:20.091
Dr. Julia ogden.

04:21.028 --> 04:21.960
- Your son brought
an injured man

04:22.095 --> 04:23.695
Into the berlin clinic
this morning.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.164
He ran off before I was able
to ask him what happened.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.299
- He was scared.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.134
He said it was the snider boy.
How is he?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.370
- I'm afraid he didn't make it.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.439
- Lord in heaven.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.407
No...

04:37.444 --> 04:38.876
- Can you help us?

04:41.248 --> 04:42.114
- Come with me.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.185
<i>- Mr. Snider's death does raise</i>
<i> some suspicions.</i>

04:47.221 --> 04:48.653
How well did you know him?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.589
- Not well.
We were the same age,

04:50.724 --> 04:52.523
But he belonged
to the other colony.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.393
I only met him because he was
thinking of joining us.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.995
- There's another colony?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.530
- Over the way.

04:58.665 --> 05:01.333
- Why was he thinking
of leaving his colony?

05:01.402 --> 05:03.668
- Uncle jebediah is
an old order mennonite.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.738
His rules are more stringent
than those we live by.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.174
- Your uncle heads
the other colony?

05:09.243 --> 05:10.408
- Yes.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.876
My brother.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.280
But that is a long story
and we are short of time.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.851
Enoch was a fine young man.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.886
Quiet, friendly.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.055
- We found a letter on him

05:24.058 --> 05:26.424
From an otto pfanschmidt
in pennsylvania.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.693
Does that name seem
familiar to you?

05:28.729 --> 05:32.097
- We still have family there,
but I don't know an otto.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.631
What did the letter say?

05:33.633 --> 05:36.768
- "I'm sorry, I know not
of whom you speak."

05:37.838 --> 05:39.971
- The last thing he said
before he died was,

05:39.973 --> 05:42.641
"I found her." does that
mean anything to you?

05:43.510 --> 05:45.577
- No. Not at all.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.046
- Where did you find mr. Snider?

05:49.083 --> 05:51.149
- Uh, it was beside the road.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.718
I was driving
our buggy into town

05:52.853 --> 05:54.386
And I saw his hat on the ground.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.588
I stopped to retrieve it
and I found him

05:56.590 --> 05:58.390
Lying just a few steps away.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.626
- Can you show us
where you found him?

06:05.366 --> 06:06.932
- He was laying right over here.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.735
(sombre music)

06:12.339 --> 06:13.939
- The ground is soft here.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.673
- His injuries couldn't
have been caused

06:15.709 --> 06:16.908
By a fall on this terrain.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.344
- What's the matter?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.280
- Mr. Snider was struck
in the back of the head

06:22.282 --> 06:24.682
With something hard,
perhaps a rock,

06:24.684 --> 06:26.584
Possibly with deliberate intent.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.955
- Then, it was an outsider.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.091
Mennonites do not commit murder,
mr. Murdoch.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.625
It is not in our nature.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.232
(coughing)

06:40.367 --> 06:41.566
(door opens)

06:45.773 --> 06:46.971
(door closes)

06:49.643 --> 06:52.009
(dramatic music)

06:58.385 --> 07:00.518
(chuckles)
- you're looking well, son.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.123
- In some ways, this has been
the best thing to happen to me.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.261
- I wouldn't go that far.
The food can't be up to much.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.561
- I've been saved.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.730
- What's that, bobby?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.032
- I'd like to be called
robert now.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.802
- You've been saved?
Saved from what?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.206
- I've entered
the catholic church.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.674
- Absolutely not!

07:24.044 --> 07:26.210
It's one thing for my best
detective to be a catholic,

07:26.246 --> 07:29.080
But no brackenreid is going
to become a bloody papist!

07:29.116 --> 07:30.915
- I'm not becoming
a catholic, father.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.551
I am one.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.757
(birds chirping)

07:40.894 --> 07:42.894
- You believe he was murdered?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.764
By whom?
- We don't yet know.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.101
The answer may, however,
lie in his colony.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.837
- You will continue to run
into walls of silence,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.772
Worse there than here.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.577
We mennonites are mistrustful
of outsiders.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.245
- You know people there, though.

08:00.247 --> 08:04.081
Your brother?
- I don't know him anymore.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.784
There is a rift between us.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.388
I left there, long ago,
because I wanted to marry

08:10.457 --> 08:13.391
A woman who was not
from the community.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.461
Jebediah shunned me.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.397
It was like a death.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.802
We pass one another
in berlin like strangers.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.871
If he can treat his own
brother like that,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.939
The two of you have little hope.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.108
- That's what enoch
was running away from.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.877
- There must be a way
to gain his trust.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.578
(sighs)

08:34.948 --> 08:37.883
- A young man's life was cut
short far too soon.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.986
Solving this crime may
give his family some peace.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.256
- Jebediah does
take in boarders.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.494
Mennonites, of course.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.262
- Meaning what?

08:52.833 --> 08:55.132
(light music)

08:57.370 --> 08:58.803
- Is everything
all right up there?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.644
(chuckling)

09:06.713 --> 09:10.281
- Hello, irmgard
and cornelius penner.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.187
- Oh! I forgot to mention:
No jewelry.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.088
- Oh!

09:21.895 --> 09:22.827
- Perfect.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.930
- But...
- Except for the beard.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.764
- Yes.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.640
Jebediah knows and trusts him.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.009
- The colony is similar to ours,

09:38.078 --> 09:40.811
But with even fewer trappings
of the modern world.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.081
- Where do we start?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.949
- Meet them where they are,
julia.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.551
Talk to the women there.

09:46.686 --> 09:49.420
They will know things
the men never hear.

09:49.456 --> 09:52.824
- Mind, the men will not
communicate directly

09:52.959 --> 09:54.592
With a woman who
is not their wife.

09:55.762 --> 09:56.494
Right.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.429
Yes.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.497
- Shall we, cornelius?

09:59.533 --> 10:01.433
- Yes, irma.
- Irmgard.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.500
- Irmgard.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.372
(soft music)

10:27.193 --> 10:29.060
Is this the friessen home?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.328
- Yes.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.664
- We are cornelius
and irmgard penner.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.868
We are passing through on our
way to do missionary work.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.071
We need a place to rest
our head a few days yet.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.407
- From where do you hail?

10:42.409 --> 10:43.340
- Manheim.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.821
- You come all this way?

10:57.957 --> 10:59.991
- We are travelers
in need of hospitality.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.227
- And why are you asking for me?

11:04.531 --> 11:07.098
- Birken falck said there
was no one more generous

11:07.134 --> 11:09.901
And charitable
than jebediah friessen.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.104
- Surely the lord said
of birken,

11:14.441 --> 11:17.775
"well done, thou good
and faithful servant."

11:19.179 --> 11:22.413
- The lord also said, "you have
been faithful over a little.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.450
I will make you ruler
over many things."

11:27.854 --> 11:31.122
- Marta, set two places
for our new friends.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.824
You will join us for lunch.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.427
- I hope you don't mind,

11:36.430 --> 11:37.729
But I need a hand
in the kitchen.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.130
- Of course.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.798
- This one slows me down

11:40.834 --> 11:42.667
And we're busy
preparing for a funeral.

11:42.802 --> 11:43.934
Follow me.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.541
- I'm sorry to hear
of the funeral.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.076
- As are we.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.480
Working on a farm is rough
and sometimes dangerous work.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.950
Though we come from dust
and to dust we shall return,

11:59.953 --> 12:01.685
It is hard to lose
someone so young.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.888
- Yes. What was
the young man's name?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.824
- Did we say the funeral
was for a man?

12:09.429 --> 12:14.298
- Oh! Uh, hard, dangerous work
on the farm was mentioned.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.833
I only assumed--

12:15.969 --> 12:16.801
- Mm.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.002
- Of course.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.372
- How old was he?

12:21.374 --> 12:24.041
- Enoch was not yet 20

12:24.077 --> 12:26.310
And about to start a life
with our daughter.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.179
- They were to be married.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.181
- It is as if we've lost
one of our own.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.984
- I'm very sorry for your loss.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.852
(clears throat)

12:35.922 --> 12:37.655
- More hands make
for shorter work, irmgard.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.123
I hope you can help
prepare the faspa

12:39.126 --> 12:41.258
For the funeral service.
- Oh, yes.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.127
I'd be happy to help
with the faspa.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.731
Where should I begin?
- Come. I'll get you an apron.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.602
- There is a vacant farmhouse
nearby where you can stay.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.137
- Thank you.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.540
- Marta will send your wife
over with goat's milk,

12:55.609 --> 12:59.010
Apple butter and bread
for tomorrow's breakfast.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.745
- This is very generous
in these trying times.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.148
- The lord does not give
us more than we can bear.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.485
- How much do I owe you
for these lodgings?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.221
- You will repay with
the strength of your back

13:10.257 --> 13:12.223
And the sweat of your brow!

13:17.163 --> 13:18.029
(sighs)

13:23.370 --> 13:24.369
(groans)

13:35.181 --> 13:38.115
(light music)

13:42.289 --> 13:43.121
- Hm.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.329
- I know I should not say this,
but I do love having

13:51.331 --> 13:53.998
All the women together,
working shoulder to shoulder.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.500
- You're right, marta,
you should hold your tongue.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.171
It's almost sinful to rejoice
in funeral work.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.140
- Sinful? No.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.810
- Finding community
in the company of women,

14:05.812 --> 14:08.913
Where we can be ourselves?
It's natural.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.084
- You've been kneading
for a while now,

14:13.153 --> 14:15.753
But your dough is hardly
holding together.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.723
Haven't you made
biscuits before?

14:19.826 --> 14:21.092
- Ah...

14:23.463 --> 14:27.665
Oh! Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.334
Ah, shall I find a tea towel?
- Oh, no! Not that one!

14:31.304 --> 14:32.503
Uh, you know, irmgard,
let's get out

14:32.639 --> 14:34.038
Of this hot kitchen for a spell.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.574
I see we don't have
any zwieback for the faspa

14:36.643 --> 14:37.575
And that will not do.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.878
Come, let us to the bakery.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.646
- Uh, you'll take care
of that, yes, ruth?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.216
- Hm.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.589
- Is it my fault?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.123
- Is what your fault?

14:54.361 --> 14:57.462
- Anglican, united,
episcopalian.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.465
I'd even be fine with lutheran!
But roman catholic, margaret?

15:00.600 --> 15:01.599
- What does it matter?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.902
Truly? He has faith.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.803
- If I didn't know better,
I'd think the lad wanted

15:05.839 --> 15:07.138
To send me to an early grave.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.774
Oh! And he wants to be called
robert now, did I mention that?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.609
- Yes, dear. A few times.
(phone rings)

15:11.678 --> 15:13.210
- The faith I don't mind.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.246
It's the mackerel snapper
I can live without.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.214
Hello? Inspector brackenreid.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.350
All right.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.752
Yes. Thank you.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.522
(sighs)

15:26.893 --> 15:28.092
Speak of the devil.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.226
- What's wrong?

15:30.897 --> 15:33.664
- Bobby's parole hearing
has been moved up to this week.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.299
This week?

15:35.335 --> 15:38.236
I didn't think he was getting
a hearing for another year.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.304
- Apparently,
he's a model prisoner

15:40.373 --> 15:42.640
And his good behaviour
hasn't escaped notice.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.509
- Bobby's prayers have
been answered.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.179
- I suppose they have.
- Oh!

15:48.248 --> 15:50.514
Thomas, he's coming home.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.651
Our boy's coming home and we're
going to be a family again!

15:53.653 --> 15:54.719
(sighs)

15:58.391 --> 16:01.592
(soft music)

16:01.594 --> 16:03.394
(indistinct chatter
in the distance)

16:05.732 --> 16:06.531
(sighs)

16:08.635 --> 16:09.666
- Oh.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.070
Thank you.
- There.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.541
- It's good to get
the blood pumping,

16:17.610 --> 16:19.877
Especially after such
a long trip from pennsylvania.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.880
- Mm. Usually,
enoch would do it.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.582
When you arrived, it was
as if you were heaven sent.

16:26.886 --> 16:29.020
- Must be difficult now
without him.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.320
I imagine he was a...

16:31.557 --> 16:32.890
A big help here on the farm.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.161
- Truthfully, he wasn't built
for hard labour.

16:37.296 --> 16:40.431
- Oh?
- He was a daydreamer.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.001
And frail, like his
mother and father.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.703
God rest their souls.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.708
But oh,
what a sharp mind he had!

16:51.978 --> 16:55.046
It's a good match
for my spirited agnes.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.849
Very tragic to lose
her betrothed,

16:58.885 --> 17:01.519
Especially so close
to the wedding.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.754
I'd like to offer
her my condolences.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.859
She is not with us right now.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.996
She's visiting my cousin
and his family

17:12.065 --> 17:14.598
In lancaster, pennsylvania.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.600
- Lancaster, you say?
- Yeah.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.471
- Met a man from lancaster once.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.739
Pfanschmidt.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.409
Don't recall his given name.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.944
- He would be one of ours then.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.879
My mother was a pfanschmidt.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.489
- Enoch didn't fit in
with the other boys his age.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.491
But he liked to talk
to the baker,

17:40.527 --> 17:41.959
Ever since the man arrived.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.296
- The baker's new to the colony?
- He is indeed.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.368
Oh, good lord.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.203
How queer.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.772
Seems he closed shop
early today.

17:56.843 --> 17:57.941
Must have run out.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.022
- Agnes is in pennsylvania?

18:13.192 --> 18:15.526
- He said she was visiting
his cousin's family.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.827
In lancaster.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.065
Perhaps that's who sent
the letter to enoch?

18:22.068 --> 18:23.934
- "I know not
of whom you speak."

18:25.204 --> 18:26.336
Do you think there's
a connection?

18:26.372 --> 18:27.571
- There has to be.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.342
- When I was in
the kitchen with marta,

18:31.344 --> 18:33.878
She stopped me opening
a cupboard.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.146
It seemed like she was
hiding something.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.416
- Jebediah only spoke well
of the boy.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.284
He seemed...

18:41.521 --> 18:43.554
...Genuinely sad
that he was gone.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.290
She described him as solitary,

18:46.425 --> 18:48.993
Said he only talked to agnes
and was quite close

18:49.128 --> 18:51.696
To the baker,
who's new to the colony.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.432
- We should speak with him.
- You think he's a suspect?

18:54.567 --> 18:56.433
(sighs)
- I don't know what to think.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.737
I hardly understand
these people at all, julia.

19:01.975 --> 19:02.773
(sighs)

19:04.977 --> 19:06.643
(chuckling)

19:08.815 --> 19:11.248
(soft music)

19:16.456 --> 19:17.922
(laughs)
- william.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.924
- I may have overdone it,
yesterday.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.459
- Oh, so, you don't want
to relocate here after all?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.329
- Surely you jest.
(chuckles)

19:25.464 --> 19:27.998
- I don't know.
You seem to fit right in here.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.600
They don't even have
electricity.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.135
It's bordering on criminal.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.669
- Oh, good! They're open.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.007
- Mm.
- Morning.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.445
Hello?

19:42.248 --> 19:43.347
- Yes?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.917
- We'd like to ask you some
questions about mr. Snider.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.686
We understand you knew him?

19:52.492 --> 19:53.457
- Indeed, I did.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.026
- Llewellyn?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.466
- Watts!

20:04.771 --> 20:06.170
What are you doing here?

20:06.172 --> 20:07.905
- Just about to proof
this sourdough,

20:08.040 --> 20:09.140
If you don't mind.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.443
- Are you a mennonite now?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.845
- In a sense.
I've not yet been baptized

20:14.981 --> 20:17.047
Into their faith,
but these people

20:17.083 --> 20:19.917
Have become my community,
my family.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.185
They welcomed me
when I was lost.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.989
- Last we heard,
you were in new york city.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.390
I had to leave.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.460
I wandered for a time
and ended up back in canada.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.862
I didn't want
to return to toronto

20:31.864 --> 20:35.399
And found myself doing odd jobs
for farmers in this area.

20:35.401 --> 20:39.670
The mennonites were always
the kindest and most generous.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.538
I admired their peaceful lives.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.941
And so, I befriended them.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.411
- And moved here?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.547
- Jebediah friessen needed
a man for physical labour.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.150
In exchange for the work,
he gave me a place to stay.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.253
- And you're their baker now?

20:59.158 --> 21:00.991
- To bake bread is easy.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.026
The ingredients are simple.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.395
When I'm doing this work...

21:06.599 --> 21:07.964
...The world is still.

21:09.302 --> 21:12.503
- And you follow their rules
and believe in their faith?

21:12.572 --> 21:13.603
- I do.

21:15.308 --> 21:18.842
- Well, forgive our surprise,
but the llewellyn watts

21:18.878 --> 21:20.645
I came to know
would have problems

21:20.780 --> 21:23.246
With the mennonite faith.
- Some.

21:23.283 --> 21:26.584
But this is a place
that prizes simplicity,

21:26.586 --> 21:28.652
Honesty and hard work.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.087
- And what about love?

21:31.257 --> 21:32.389
- Julia...

21:37.897 --> 21:40.464
- The world is full of cruelty
and injustice.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.334
At least here,
I can see and believe

21:43.469 --> 21:44.468
In the goodness of people.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.737
- Mm.

21:46.872 --> 21:50.407
Unfortunately, injustice
is why we're here.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.645
- I don't believe it.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.480
What happened to enoch
was an accident.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.349
- The evidence suggests
otherwise.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.284
- These are peaceful people.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.553
No one here would harm anyone,
let alone one of their own.

22:02.688 --> 22:04.955
- Well, that may be true,
but we have questions

22:05.024 --> 22:06.490
That remain unanswered.

22:06.526 --> 22:09.026
- So, you've put on these
clothes and taken false names?

22:09.095 --> 22:11.628
- Something happened
to that boy, watts.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.364
We have to uncover the truth.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.999
- By lying to a community
of good people.

22:17.370 --> 22:20.704
- I'm sure they're good people,
but someone knows something.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.139
Help us, watts.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.775
- You were close to him,
weren't you?

22:25.778 --> 22:27.644
- We struck up a friendship.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.113
- How did that come about?

22:32.385 --> 22:35.119
- Outsiders can sense
other outsiders.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.187
- So, he didn't fit in here?

22:38.124 --> 22:39.457
- You could say that.

22:39.459 --> 22:42.259
- Not all the rules of
this place fit with his life.

22:43.329 --> 22:45.596
He was uneasy about
his upcoming marriage.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.830
- To agnes friessen?

22:48.134 --> 22:49.867
- It was arranged by
a matchmaker.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.001
He wasn't in love with her.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.502
- Do you know agnes?

22:53.673 --> 22:56.640
- She was already visiting
family when I arrived.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.009
- How long ago was that?

23:00.079 --> 23:01.078
- Four months.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.646
Maybe five.

23:04.117 --> 23:07.350
- Watts, something is going on
with agnes friessen.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.219
- The family is
hiding something.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.023
- The friessens have
been nothing but welcoming

23:13.025 --> 23:15.025
And hospitable to me
since I arrived.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.694
- When did you last see
enoch snider?

23:18.531 --> 23:19.830
- The morning before he died.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.198
- How did he seem?

23:22.735 --> 23:26.236
- Well, he was arguing
with a woman, sadie jutzi.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.671
- Who's that?

23:27.707 --> 23:31.708
- Some, not I, would describe
her as the colony busybody.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.977
She's a kind woman.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.512
She couldn't have
anything to do with a murder.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.381
- She might know something.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.383
Perhaps whatever they
were arguing about

23:39.385 --> 23:41.252
Has something to do
with why he's dead?

23:41.387 --> 23:42.453
- How would we find her?

23:43.722 --> 23:45.389
- Presumably, she'll be
preparing for the faspa

23:45.391 --> 23:46.423
With the other women.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.259
If you don't mind,
I have work to do.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.461
I'll keep your secret for now,

23:51.497 --> 23:53.296
But finish your business
here and go.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.008
- Oh, excuse me.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.879
- We don't have any
of the tiger lilies--

24:08.915 --> 24:10.948
- Excuse me. Are you mrs. Jutzi?

24:11.017 --> 24:12.149
- I am.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.885
- I was told to ask you
where to put the platz.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.121
- Were you? Well, the food is
being brought downstairs, dear.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.759
You're the one staying here
with your husband, are you?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.693
- Yes. We're staying with
the friessens.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.095
They've been so kind.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.898
Did you know mr. Snider well?

24:27.934 --> 24:28.899
- Yes.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.635
Do you have any sense
of what happened to him?

24:32.271 --> 24:33.403
- No one does.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.773
I'm just saddened his last hours
were spent in strife.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.607
- Oh?

24:40.713 --> 24:43.380
- He was having a row
with jebediah that morning.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.249
I tried to speak
to him about it,

24:45.384 --> 24:47.384
But he was such a private boy.

24:47.386 --> 24:49.119
I mean, it was clear
he was in distress.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.122
- About what?
- Well, he wouldn't tell me.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.258
- All I know is
I heard enoch saying,

24:54.393 --> 24:55.459
"what have you done?"

24:55.594 --> 24:57.695
- Do you know what he was
referring to?

24:57.697 --> 25:01.465
- No. But if I was to guess?
(clears throat)

25:01.600 --> 25:03.667
It must have had something
to do with the wedding.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.002
- To jebediah's daughter.
- Of course.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.606
- Oh, oh, yes. That's good.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.810
<i> - "what have you done?"</i>

25:12.945 --> 25:14.778
- That's what mrs. Jutzi said.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.883
- I hate to say it,

25:19.886 --> 25:22.686
Jebediah has to be a suspect
in this murder.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.556
- Why? Because enoch didn't
want to marry his daughter?

25:25.558 --> 25:30.093
- Or because enoch discovered
jebediah did something to her.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.495
- You can't think...

25:31.630 --> 25:33.964
- She hasn't been seen
in months.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.700
- Enoch's dying words were,
"I found her."

25:36.835 --> 25:38.702
You think it could have
been agnes he meant?

25:38.704 --> 25:42.239
- Perhaps. And perhaps
that's what got him killed.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.308
Well, if that's the case,
we're missing

25:44.310 --> 25:45.642
A rather large piece
of the puzzle.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.179
- We need to search
the friessen house.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.181
There's something behind
that cupboard door.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.118
- The entire colony will
be attending the funeral.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.120
Our absence would be noted.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.556
- Could be our chance.

26:02.127 --> 26:04.562
- We've learned that
enoch snider had

26:04.697 --> 26:07.798
A public disagreement with
jebediah just before his death.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.266
- And what do you make of that?

26:10.303 --> 26:13.003
- We believe it has something
to do with his daughter.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.540
We are going to search
jebediah's home

26:16.675 --> 26:18.608
During the service for evidence.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.877
We need you to occupy him
should he become aware

26:20.947 --> 26:23.279
That we have stepped away.
- Absolutely not.

26:24.517 --> 26:26.716
- We need your help, watts!
- I want no part of this.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.491
- Don't you want to know
what's happened to enoch?

26:34.493 --> 26:37.427
- Not like this.
I'm not a detective anymore.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.229
- You still know
right from wrong.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.566
- I do. And I know
the people here are good people.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.903
- I'm the last person
to judge anyone's faith,

26:46.939 --> 26:49.573
But you said yourself
you are tired of injustice.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.942
Someone here is lying.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.178
There is an injustice
that is being covered up.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.379
- You can't know that.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.580
- Oh?

26:56.715 --> 26:58.715
Then why is enoch snider dead?

26:59.885 --> 27:01.852
- What are you saying?
That jebediah killed him?

27:01.921 --> 27:04.154
- I don't know.
- No, you don't.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.056
And you don't know these people!

27:06.125 --> 27:08.993
- Watts, no community
is a monolith.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.263
I can see why you admire them,
why you admire their faith.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.332
But someone is lying
and someone is hiding something.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.268
Don't you want
to expose the truth?

27:20.205 --> 27:21.738
- That's not who I am anymore.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.274
- You're still
the same person, watts.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.876
You can't deny who you are!

27:30.016 --> 27:33.216
- I've denied who I am
every day of my life.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.419
It's no different here
than anywhere else.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.189
- Oh! You are hiding here,
watts!

27:40.159 --> 27:42.425
Hiding from the truth
of who you are

27:42.461 --> 27:44.761
And the truth of
what it is that you want.

27:44.797 --> 27:48.198
(church bell ringing)

27:49.568 --> 27:52.836
The only way out of darkness
is to bring the truth to light.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.509
- Funeral's about to start.

28:02.648 --> 28:03.714
(sighs)

28:06.585 --> 28:08.385
- Be prepared for anything
that they throw at you.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.586
- I am prepared, father.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.188
- If you tell them
what they want to hear,

28:11.323 --> 28:12.790
You'll be out of prison
in no time.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.658
- I will tell them the truth.
- Of course.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.394
- The result rests
in god's hands.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.196
- And the result will be
good if you tell them

28:19.265 --> 28:20.397
What they want to hear.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.998
- I'm not going to lie
anymore, father.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.467
- Who said anything about lying?

28:23.536 --> 28:25.202
- I'm going to tell them
about gerard lacroix.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.071
- That it was an accident,
like you said at trial.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.538
- It wasn't an accident.

28:28.574 --> 28:29.606
- What are you saying?

28:32.010 --> 28:34.043
- We fought,
as I've said before.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.946
- But in that final moment...

28:38.617 --> 28:39.616
...I wanted him dead.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.218
I meant to kill him.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.486
- No, you didn't.

28:42.621 --> 28:43.853
- My heart knows the truth.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.356
- I've already confessed
in the eyes of god

28:46.425 --> 28:47.590
And I will not lie again.

28:48.794 --> 28:51.028
- You do that, they'll never
let you out of here.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.162
You might never get parole.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.698
- And if I lie,
I betray god's forgiveness.

28:56.736 --> 28:59.903
If staying here is
god's will, so be it.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.439
- You'll break
your mother's heart.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.174
Is that what you want, robert?

29:04.210 --> 29:05.742
- This isn't about want, father.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.844
Confession requires sacrifice.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.747
- Then sacrifice for her.
She wants you home.

29:10.783 --> 29:11.982
- Bailiff,
bring in the prisoner.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.316
- She'll understand.

29:16.455 --> 29:17.453
I'm sorry.

29:18.424 --> 29:23.126
(sombre music)

29:43.615 --> 29:44.781
(clears throat)

29:49.655 --> 29:50.888
- And now, it's locked.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.223
- Whatever is in there,

29:53.259 --> 29:55.124
Someone doesn't want it
being discovered.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.398
Julia?

30:07.473 --> 30:09.640
- You're not staying
for the rest of the service?

30:09.642 --> 30:11.308
- I have a pressing matter
to attend to.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.443
- I'd like a moment
of your time.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.979
This funeral has given me
a newfound sense of clarity.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.449
- Walk with me.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.055
- I'm very grateful to be
a part of this community

30:25.057 --> 30:26.390
And very much want to stay.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.791
- We are lucky to have you.

30:28.527 --> 30:29.860
You're one of us.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.862
All that is left is
for you to be baptized.

30:33.198 --> 30:36.133
- What if I cannot ascribe
to all tenets of the faith?

30:36.135 --> 30:37.166
- What do you mean?

30:38.136 --> 30:39.803
- Even if I am ready
to accept god,

30:39.805 --> 30:42.806
He may not be ready
to accept me.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.075
- You are a child of god,
made in his image.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.677
He loves and accepts you.

30:47.746 --> 30:50.414
- And if I don't want
to take a wife?

30:50.549 --> 30:53.150
- Well, maybe not now,
but perhaps later.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.618
I will speak
with the matchmaker.

30:54.753 --> 30:56.887
- I'm not interested
in having a wife, jebediah.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.956
- You wish to be a bachelor?

30:59.992 --> 31:00.858
- Yes.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.695
- Life without
a partner is hard.

31:04.830 --> 31:05.595
- I know.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.700
- Your relationship
with god is your own.

31:10.736 --> 31:14.037
If you love him,
he will guide you.

31:16.842 --> 31:18.508
- And the people here?

31:18.644 --> 31:20.777
Will they love me if
I live my life differently

31:20.846 --> 31:22.045
From how they live theirs?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.481
- Have we not already
accepted you, my son?

31:33.058 --> 31:34.490
- This must be agnes.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.127
- There are over two dozen
unopened letters

31:37.196 --> 31:38.729
From enoch to agnes here.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.598
- They're all to lancaster,
but none with postage.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.600
- Enoch must have been
writing and writing

31:43.735 --> 31:46.136
To agnes and jebediah never
sent the letters.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.538
- He must have sent the letter
to otto himself,

31:48.574 --> 31:50.073
Hence the reply we found on him.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.475
- "I know not
of whom you speak."

31:51.477 --> 31:53.343
That had to be referring
to agnes friessen.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.246
- So, he confronts jebediah
with the letter from otto,

31:56.248 --> 31:58.615
Demanding to know where agnes is
and is killed for it?

31:59.818 --> 32:02.485
- Assuming all of that
is true, where's agnes?

32:03.555 --> 32:05.822
- Well, if she's not
where he says she is,

32:05.824 --> 32:07.224
One must think the worst.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.025
She's dead?

32:09.061 --> 32:12.195
- And if she is, we may
know where the body is.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.706
- Just one more question?

32:22.708 --> 32:24.240
- Good llewelyn,
you're like a puppy dog

32:24.310 --> 32:26.576
Nipping at my heels today.
What is it?

32:26.578 --> 32:28.111
- Where is agnes?

32:31.784 --> 32:33.082
- Why would you ask me that?

32:34.186 --> 32:35.952
- Just tell me. Please.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.259
- William, hurry!
I hear footsteps!

32:42.261 --> 32:43.927
- I assure you:
Telling me to hurry

32:44.062 --> 32:46.529
Will not hasten
this process, julia.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.064
- Get away from that door.

32:50.168 --> 32:51.167
What are you doing?

32:52.771 --> 32:54.071
- Searching for evidence.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.872
- Is this about enoch snider?

32:56.709 --> 32:58.475
He died in a tragic accident.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.010
- No, he didn't, mr. Friessen.

33:00.012 --> 33:02.479
He died from blunt force
trauma to the head!

33:02.548 --> 33:04.614
You killed him
when he discovered

33:04.750 --> 33:06.416
What you'd done
to your daughter, agnes.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.218
She's not in lancaster,
pennsylvania, is she?

33:08.287 --> 33:10.153
- What are you saying?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.687
- Is she dead?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.123
- Dead?

33:14.493 --> 33:18.628
How dare you come into my home
and... Who are you people?

33:18.664 --> 33:19.996
- Open this door!

33:20.131 --> 33:23.166
- I will take no orders
from you. Now, leave my home.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.869
- Open the door.
- I said, get out!

33:25.871 --> 33:28.505
- Open the door, jebediah.
Please.

33:30.909 --> 33:31.708
- Father?

33:36.048 --> 33:37.146
What's going on?

33:38.316 --> 33:43.453
- As you can see,
my daughter is alive and well.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.655
(dramatic music)

33:49.594 --> 33:50.460
- That's pretty.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.397
Your hands are a little swollen.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.600
Are you experiencing
any discomfort?

33:56.735 --> 33:57.467
- No.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.871
Agnes, how long have you
been locked in the attic?

34:02.641 --> 34:04.140
- Locked in?

34:04.209 --> 34:07.143
We are keeping her there
out of love, not punishment.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.612
- How is hiding her away love?

34:10.682 --> 34:12.815
- My daughter was betrothed,
but not wed.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.152
For her condition to be known

34:15.287 --> 34:17.019
Would bring great shame
upon all of us.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.722
- So, you lied to everyone?

34:20.059 --> 34:21.858
- She may have been shunned.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.960
Our entire family would
have been judged

34:23.962 --> 34:27.497
For failing to raise children
who follow the word of god.

34:28.700 --> 34:29.900
- So you hid her.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.770
- We agreed that she would
deliver the child

34:33.839 --> 34:35.839
And we would raise it
as our own.

34:35.908 --> 34:39.709
- And your wife, she isn't
really with child then.

34:39.845 --> 34:40.811
- Mm.

34:40.946 --> 34:43.813
It was the best solution
under the circumstances.

34:44.983 --> 34:47.984
- You shunned your own brother
for marrying

34:47.986 --> 34:50.520
Outside the faith 20 years ago.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.155
- And it hurt me deeply.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.923
But it was deemed appropriate
by myself

34:53.959 --> 34:55.659
And the other elders
at the time.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.728
- But why kill enoch?

34:59.865 --> 35:03.466
- As god as my witness,
I did not harm that boy.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.834
- But you were seen
arguing with him

35:04.903 --> 35:06.536
Just shortly before his death.

35:06.538 --> 35:10.874
He had discovered that agnes
wasn't in pennsylvania.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.743
- Yes, he received a letter
from my cousin, otto,

35:13.745 --> 35:15.345
That put the truth to the lie.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.246
- And confronted you with it.

35:17.282 --> 35:21.151
I told him she was in
a good place and safe,

35:21.220 --> 35:23.887
But couldn't make him understand
that I was helping her.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.425
- If you didn't kill him,
what happened?

35:29.461 --> 35:31.127
- I do not know.

35:33.031 --> 35:37.333
You may not believe me,
but god knows the truth.

35:44.877 --> 35:47.177
- Get away from my daughter.

35:47.179 --> 35:50.714
- Well, I was simply ensuring
that she's healthy.

35:50.849 --> 35:51.981
- I said...

35:54.519 --> 35:56.152
Get away from her.

35:58.356 --> 35:59.622
- He's still lying to us.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.658
- Why do you say that?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.793
- They know more about enoch's
demise than they're saying.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.328
- Well, how can you be sure?

36:05.463 --> 36:08.598
- I assure you, enoch did
not father agnes' child.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.200
- Meaning?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.937
- Enoch and agnes were already
supposed to get married.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.939
What would have stopped
the family from simply

36:16.074 --> 36:18.875
Moving up the wedding date
rather than this elaborate plan

36:18.877 --> 36:20.543
To hide her in the attic
for nine months?

36:21.947 --> 36:23.947
- Even if she had a different
suitor, what does that change?

36:24.016 --> 36:26.616
- If enoch had no interest
in marrying agnes,

36:26.652 --> 36:29.219
Why not allow her to
marry whomever she pleased?

36:29.354 --> 36:32.155
- It's someone the family
finds highly undesirable.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.458
- A union that would bring
even more shame

36:35.460 --> 36:36.826
Than a child out of wedlock.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.029
- The ring!
- The what?

36:39.164 --> 36:40.529
- We need to speak to agnes.

36:41.767 --> 36:44.233
- I'd rather not face
jebediah right now.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.906
- Agnes, could you hold
out your hands?

36:50.642 --> 36:51.641
- What are you doing?

36:53.912 --> 36:55.712
- When's the last time
you left the house?

36:55.847 --> 36:57.447
She hasn't been out
of the house for months.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.483
- Then, where did you
get that ring?

37:01.553 --> 37:02.952
The grass is still fresh.

37:04.189 --> 37:05.087
- I...

37:05.824 --> 37:06.956
- Agnes?

37:08.060 --> 37:09.259
- Someone's been visiting you,
haven't they?

37:09.261 --> 37:10.527
When your parents are out?

37:11.163 --> 37:12.495
- Speak up, girl.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.731
- Someone's been
visiting me here.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.068
I'm sorry, papa.

37:19.037 --> 37:21.504
- Who?
- I can't say.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.074
- You may feel it shameful,
but I promise you,

37:25.143 --> 37:26.676
There'll be no judgment from us.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.880
- It is time to tell them, dear.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.217
Oh, it's enough with the lies.
- We cannot.

37:34.219 --> 37:37.320
- Her suitor is mervin friessen.

37:39.224 --> 37:40.623
- Your brother's son?

37:40.626 --> 37:41.457
- Yeah.

37:42.494 --> 37:43.893
- The one you shunned
and cast out?

37:44.029 --> 37:46.496
- He can never know.
No one can ever know!

37:46.498 --> 37:48.098
- I want to marry mervin.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.132
- We have discussed this!

37:52.737 --> 37:55.371
- Mervin friessen is the one
that found enoch snider.

37:56.775 --> 37:57.840
- Yes, I lied to you.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.176
Of that I'm guilty.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.313
But I did not kill enoch snider.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.115
- Tell us exactly what happened.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.987
- I knew agnes was being hidden
by her parents,

38:12.024 --> 38:13.389
But I had to see her.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.727
When her family was
at the meeting house,

38:17.862 --> 38:19.462
I'd sneak into the attic.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.665
- Did enoch know about this?
- No.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.700
But he didn't want
to marry her, anyway.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.670
- What happened the day he died?

38:30.742 --> 38:33.609
- I was leaving agnes' place
when I found him injured

38:33.679 --> 38:36.879
On uncle jebediah's property.
That's why I lied.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.882
I couldn't tell you where
I was when I saw him.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.617
- Oh, mervin.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.885
(sighs)

38:42.020 --> 38:44.487
- You panicked because you
weren't supposed to be there?

38:45.724 --> 38:48.491
- But he was hurt.
I couldn't leave him.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.360
So, I picked him up
and I brought him to you.

38:50.362 --> 38:51.561
- You lied.

38:53.098 --> 38:56.099
To these fine people,
to your own father.

38:56.802 --> 38:57.767
- I'm sorry, father.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.037
- All right, take us to where
you really found him.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.175
- I found him lying just here.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.379
- No rocks that he could
have fallen onto.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.182
- It's still most likely that
a rock was used as the weapon.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.384
- There's a place back here
where rock pickers

39:14.519 --> 39:15.785
Leave their findings.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.387
They dump them in the creek!

39:20.592 --> 39:21.725
Right down there.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.130
- It's nothing but rocks.

39:32.003 --> 39:32.802
- Julia?

39:41.946 --> 39:43.712
- Yes, that's definitely blood.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.483
- There's something else here.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.284
- Something left by the killer?

39:55.093 --> 39:58.861
- Possibly, but mennonites
don't wear jewelry.

39:59.631 --> 40:00.629
- Except for watches.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.303
- Actually, I feel as if I've
seen that somewhere before.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.776
I noticed your watch chain
in this photograph earlier.

40:13.845 --> 40:14.977
It caught my eye,
because I didn't think

40:15.013 --> 40:16.146
Mennonites wore jewelry.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.717
- Yes, it is mine.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.354
- Marta,

40:27.259 --> 40:29.024
Tell them you did not
hurt the boy.

40:30.528 --> 40:32.328
- I cannot.
(sighs)

40:33.531 --> 40:34.831
- Why did you do it?

40:37.369 --> 40:38.868
- Enoch discovered the truth.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.337
He threatened to tell
abraham's colony

40:41.339 --> 40:42.806
That he'd found agnes
in our attic.

40:42.941 --> 40:43.806
- No.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.341
- He wanted out
of the engagement.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.910
I told him it wasn't possible,
that it would ruin everything!

40:49.247 --> 40:50.713
- Marta.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.216
- I saw him in the field
and I begged him not to tell.

40:54.419 --> 40:57.820
He called us false mennonites
in the eyes of god

40:57.856 --> 41:00.824
And that we would be
excommunicated as liars

41:00.959 --> 41:03.893
And hypocrites who shunned
abraham for a much lesser crime!

41:03.895 --> 41:05.695
- What have you done?

41:09.634 --> 41:10.800
- Lord forgive me.

41:12.904 --> 41:16.372
I knew not what I was doing,
but I had to stop him.

41:19.444 --> 41:20.777
- Mrs. Friessen,

41:20.912 --> 41:23.012
You are guilty of murder.

41:28.386 --> 41:30.119
- Please forgive me, jebediah.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.489
Please forgive me.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.795
- It is not for me to forgive.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.267
- Oh!

41:45.537 --> 41:47.537
(panting)

41:50.508 --> 41:52.141
(sobs)

41:57.282 --> 41:58.581
(man): See you in the courtroom.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.097
(soft music)

42:24.776 --> 42:29.111
(soft religious singing)

42:43.861 --> 42:45.294
- You decided not to stay?

42:46.331 --> 42:48.064
- This isn't the place for me.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.399
- Come with us.

42:49.534 --> 42:51.166
- Thank you, but no.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.703
- Where will you go?

42:55.340 --> 42:56.205
- I don't know.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.009
Should have known my wish
for utopia was folly.

43:00.144 --> 43:01.077
- Not folly.

43:02.380 --> 43:03.946
We all strive
for something better.

43:07.151 --> 43:07.951
- Thank you.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.620
For what you did for enoch.

43:11.856 --> 43:13.956
- Perhaps he'll find
justice in heaven.

43:21.165 --> 43:22.231
Hyuh!

43:26.904 --> 43:29.271
(♪)

43:41.919 --> 43:44.920
(dramatic music)

43:46.124 --> 43:48.357
Subtitling: Difuze
