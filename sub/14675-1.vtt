02:27.410 --> 02:31.650
Let's NDP here.
We're gonna NDP here.

02:39.930 --> 02:42.730
Eriksson, hold up.

02:43.010 --> 02:45.770
Set up claymores
on the left flank.

03:12.691 --> 03:15.210
Did that sound
hollow to you, man?

03:16.611 --> 03:17.811
What?

03:21.491 --> 03:22.851
Wait.

03:34.411 --> 03:38.531
We could be standing right over their
tunnels right now, couldn't we?

03:40.211 --> 03:42.251
Right under us
at this very second...

03:42.492 --> 03:44.772
...could be VC tunnels.

03:45.971 --> 03:47.731
-Shit!
-What was that?

03:48.892 --> 03:50.532
Fix that sound!

03:56.572 --> 04:00.012
-I hate fucking mortars.
-Fix that sound, sergeant.

04:00.292 --> 04:03.092
They're after somebody else.
Who are they after?

04:03.372 --> 04:06.692
-Is it 3rd Platoon?
-Captain Hill says Alpha's hit.

04:06.972 --> 04:10.652
-Do they know we're here?
-What do you say, Meserve?

04:11.052 --> 04:15.172
-I'll get it to you ASAP.
-Sergeant Hawthorne!

04:16.372 --> 04:18.732
Set out security to the flanks,
front and rear.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.692
But not too far so they
get separated from us.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.932
Eriksson, take the right flank.

04:24.092 --> 04:27.053
Call Superman 0-2.
We need a fix on the tube.

04:27.252 --> 04:29.532
We'll adjust by the sound.

04:29.733 --> 04:32.412
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2....

04:58.333 --> 05:02.613
-What the fuck is going on?
-Cease fire!

05:02.853 --> 05:06.214
I saw a gook, sarge.
One of them gooks from the ville.

05:07.334 --> 05:10.174
-You recognizing people?
-I saw him!

05:11.933 --> 05:14.933
The tube's kicking ass on Alpha.

05:15.134 --> 05:16.453
Fuck this!

05:17.054 --> 05:19.694
The tube's got a fix on us!

05:21.014 --> 05:22.654
Oh, Christ!

05:23.013 --> 05:25.734
They found us!
They're walking them in on us!

05:26.654 --> 05:28.454
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2.

05:29.774 --> 05:30.734
Let's move!

05:31.375 --> 05:35.895
The tube's got a fix on us.
Left flank! Move on!

05:38.654 --> 05:40.695
Silent Twin 0-2, out.

05:42.014 --> 05:43.334
Go! Go!

05:55.254 --> 05:59.695
Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus!
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

06:42.096 --> 06:44.376
-Where's Hawthorne?
-Up this way.

06:44.616 --> 06:47.336
Eriksson's on right flank.
He ain't in yet.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.097
This war's getting old, Mr. Meserve.

06:54.857 --> 06:56.777
Here comes arty!

06:57.696 --> 06:58.896
Fuck!

07:01.297 --> 07:05.736
Oh, shit!
Oh, Jesus!

07:06.296 --> 07:10.976
Okay, Brownie, you get up there with
them. Keep your shit together.

07:13.537 --> 07:18.737
My shit is forever together.
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker!

07:19.457 --> 07:22.177
Oh, fuck! Help me!

07:23.537 --> 07:28.137
Oh, fuck!
Somebody help me!

07:49.258 --> 07:52.018
What's wrong with my arm?
Where's my arm?

07:52.217 --> 07:54.858
-I got something for you.
-You gotta find my arm.

07:55.058 --> 07:59.058
-We gotta move!
-Calm down, soldier!

07:59.578 --> 08:03.658
Help me! Somebody help me! Help!

08:11.898 --> 08:14.699
Here's your arm. Here's your arm.

08:27.898 --> 08:31.339
Somebody help me!

08:32.018 --> 08:33.938
Help! Help!

08:41.899 --> 08:44.499
Help me! Somebody!

08:49.619 --> 08:52.379
Sarge, I need help!

08:52.579 --> 08:56.900
Sarge, help me! I'm stuck!
Oh, I'm stuck. Help me.

08:57.099 --> 09:01.219
-Thank God!
-Pull!

09:07.779 --> 09:09.459
Oh, shit!

09:14.820 --> 09:16.699
I'll put some tracers up there.

09:16.940 --> 09:20.620
-Back me up with the thumper, okay?
-Right.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.100
-Ready?
-Yeah.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.220
Get some, motherfucker!

09:26.500 --> 09:29.620
Get some! Motherfucker!

09:32.140 --> 09:34.420
Yeah, you fuck!

09:36.300 --> 09:38.181
Yeah.

09:50.141 --> 09:53.341
Some mad fucking
minute, huh, cherry?

10:11.501 --> 10:15.342
-We're getting too short for this.
-We ain't short yet.

10:15.541 --> 10:18.902
Thirty days and a wake-up.
We damn near invisible.

10:19.062 --> 10:23.101
You're gonna DEROS out of
this jungle and these clothes.

10:23.261 --> 10:28.222
Put me on that Freedom Bird
and I figure I'm short...

10:28.502 --> 10:31.701
...and maybe
the fucker's gonna crash.

10:31.942 --> 10:34.222
Can you imagine that?
Escape from Nam...

10:34.461 --> 10:37.822
-...to die an airline fatality.
-Never happen, cherry.

10:38.022 --> 10:41.062
You survive the Nam,
you get to live forever.

10:42.902 --> 10:44.742
How long you been here?

10:44.942 --> 10:46.982
-Three weeks.
-Three weeks?

10:47.502 --> 10:49.382
You're breaking my heart.

10:50.622 --> 10:52.822
You know, Meserve,
I've been thinking.

10:53.022 --> 10:56.382
Maybe it's time we stopped
balling these bitches.

10:56.582 --> 10:58.302
We might end up
home diseased.

10:58.502 --> 11:00.463
Dinky dau, man.

11:02.223 --> 11:03.782
The Nam's a trip.

11:03.982 --> 11:07.143
First you don't know shit,
then you don't give a shit.

11:07.343 --> 11:12.263
I mean, you care, but it's just
humpbacked and crooked, you know?

11:12.503 --> 11:15.743
The cherry'll get wasted
because he don't know nothing.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.543
We'll end up in peril because
we don't care about nothing.

11:18.742 --> 11:21.983
-I care, Brown.
-Sure you do.

11:22.183 --> 11:24.943
It's just humpbacked
and crooked, you know?

11:25.943 --> 11:27.663
Clark...

11:27.983 --> 11:31.983
...you and Hatcher and Eriksson
spread out here.

11:32.183 --> 11:34.103
Stay alert.

11:34.383 --> 11:37.543
And don't get lost.
Brownie, let's didi.

11:53.423 --> 11:57.784
Hershey bar number one! Good
stuff. Take a big bite.

11:58.223 --> 12:00.344
Check out this sad ass, man.

12:02.744 --> 12:04.384
Sui?
It's mango.

12:04.584 --> 12:08.584
Quit begging. They don't want your
candy bar. Give it to me.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.624
Cam on ong very much.

12:10.864 --> 12:15.784
Don't eat anything they give you.
Go back where you're supposed to be.

12:17.545 --> 12:19.664
You want to die horribly?

12:19.904 --> 12:22.104
-No, sarge.
-You were gonna eat it?

12:22.345 --> 12:26.585
These people are confused.
Are they Cong or not?

12:26.784 --> 12:30.225
-They're schizophrenic.
-Depends on who scared them last.

12:30.425 --> 12:34.945
You eat some razor blades or
glass in something they give you...

12:35.145 --> 12:37.505
-...what are you dead of?
-Stupidity.

12:37.745 --> 12:40.545
It's a rog, Brown.
Much affirmed.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.065
Yes, indeed.

12:44.265 --> 12:47.785
We're overjoyed to have travelled
11 ,000 miles...

12:47.985 --> 12:50.785
...to assist them in their struggle
to upgrade themselves.

12:50.985 --> 12:54.345
Every one of them is
old or kids. That ain't good.

12:54.545 --> 12:57.986
This is a retirement ville.
Sort of like Florida.

12:58.225 --> 13:02.106
I wasn't gonna eat that.
I didn't want to be rude.

13:02.305 --> 13:04.426
-Rude?
-Yeah.

13:05.266 --> 13:09.545
I'll smack you upside the
head for talking that foolishness!

13:09.746 --> 13:13.346
You do something rude, you say,
"Sorry about that."

13:13.586 --> 13:16.826
For example, you
strangle their chickens...

13:17.026 --> 13:21.266
...cop their rice, or
barbecue their fucking hootch...

13:21.466 --> 13:24.106
...you say, "Sorry about that."

13:24.306 --> 13:27.546
Let me hear you say it.
"Sorry about that."

13:27.746 --> 13:29.786
Sorry about that.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.147
I got something for us, sir.

13:32.386 --> 13:37.546
We asked him which path was safe. One
day he says one, next day the other.

13:38.906 --> 13:42.827
You VC? VC?

13:43.026 --> 13:45.947
Number fucking 10! VC?

13:46.146 --> 13:48.867
-You number fucking 10?
-No!

13:49.227 --> 13:51.347
-You VC?
-VC, no!

13:55.147 --> 13:59.747
All right! We got it!
Number one, old man.

13:59.987 --> 14:03.507
I hope that ain't your
idea of fun, buddy.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.587
This is some
piece of equipment!

14:06.827 --> 14:08.867
Don't look like it to me.

14:09.107 --> 14:12.308
Look like some tree got tangled up.

14:12.507 --> 14:16.267
And this fool gonna tie it to his cow.

14:16.548 --> 14:19.588
Do you know how
one of these things works?

14:19.787 --> 14:22.827
Ain't you supposed to be
hauling water to your pals...

14:23.028 --> 14:26.268
...instead of hanging out with
this motherfucker?

14:26.467 --> 14:28.348
-Yeah.
-So let's go, then.

14:28.547 --> 14:32.868
Right. Okay. No, no, no.
All right. Shit.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.348
Sarge wants us together,
we best do it.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.828
Don't you want to get home
for your own plowing?

14:39.028 --> 14:41.468
-You're married, right?
-Yeah.

14:43.468 --> 14:46.708
Yeah, yeah, come on, motherfucker!

14:52.948 --> 14:56.069
What the fuck
was I talking about, man?

14:57.549 --> 14:59.749
This some bad-ass Thai stick, man.

15:01.348 --> 15:04.709
You got any babies?
That's what I was talking about.

15:04.949 --> 15:07.149
-A little girl.
-A little girl?

15:07.348 --> 15:09.189
Now ain't that my point?

15:09.388 --> 15:12.828
What were you doing back there?
Sarge had to save you.

15:13.069 --> 15:15.269
The ground opened up on me.

15:15.509 --> 15:20.269
I'm hanging there. Half in,
half out of one of the tunnels.

15:20.509 --> 15:24.189
Mortar rounds coming straight
at me. Boom, boom, boom!

15:24.389 --> 15:27.070
-I couldn't believe it.
-Did you pee your pants?

15:27.269 --> 15:29.829
-Don't be shy. Talk to me.
-I'm talking.

15:30.029 --> 15:34.709
You ain't telling me nothing.
Your ass was stuck in a rabbit hole?

15:34.949 --> 15:36.829
So, what happened?

15:37.029 --> 15:38.629
-Man, come on.
-Come on.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.949
Think of me as your priest.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.790
-Lutherans don't have priests.
-Did you pee your pants?

15:43.989 --> 15:47.509
If the sarge hadn't come back
for me, I sure would have.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.590
Without sarge, you ain't
nothing but a sack of shit.

15:50.790 --> 15:53.590
You ain't walking along
jiving with me.

15:53.790 --> 15:58.470
You so much grief bagged and tagged
that your people moan all their lives.

15:58.710 --> 15:59.670
Right, sarge?

16:02.350 --> 16:03.910
Hatch!

16:04.310 --> 16:06.310
-Hatcher!
-What?

16:06.510 --> 16:10.470
You got 30 days to learn
what you can from me and Meserve.

16:12.630 --> 16:13.831
Hatcher!

16:15.150 --> 16:17.270
-Listen up.
-I'm listening.

16:17.511 --> 16:20.511
We gonna DEROS and leave
Freedom Frontier--

16:28.751 --> 16:31.071
One o'clock!

16:36.991 --> 16:38.471
Behind you!

16:44.871 --> 16:47.471
Oh, my God, I hit it!

16:47.791 --> 16:48.911
Sarge!

17:01.912 --> 17:05.752
All right, cease fire! Cease fire!

17:16.992 --> 17:21.872
-I told you this place wasn't safe.
-The bastards set us up!

17:24.112 --> 17:29.032
Sarge, I'm in trouble, man.
I'm in trouble, sarge.

17:29.592 --> 17:33.592
-It ain't nothing, Brownie.
-You sure, man?

17:34.952 --> 17:38.992
It sure feels like something.
It feels bad, sarge.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.752
It ain't nothing, man.

17:43.993 --> 17:47.833
Eriksson, the sarge says
I'm gonna be okay, man.

17:48.033 --> 17:51.313
Oh, yeah. No sweat, Brownie.

18:01.033 --> 18:04.313
Fuck this shit, man!
Fuck this!

18:26.753 --> 18:28.673
Let's go, let's go!

18:29.633 --> 18:31.034
Come on, move it!

18:31.234 --> 18:32.554
Sarge!

18:32.794 --> 18:36.634
Look in my fucking eyes!
I'm gonna hypnotize you!

18:36.794 --> 18:39.274
You're fine.

18:39.514 --> 18:43.554
I know it, man.
I know it.

19:01.474 --> 19:06.555
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker.
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker.

19:07.675 --> 19:09.715
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker.

19:17.355 --> 19:21.715
Sergeant! Sergeant Meserve, you're to
go two clicks back to the road.

19:21.915 --> 19:24.035
APCs are there to
take you to Ap Thanh.

19:24.275 --> 19:28.435
Take a truck back to Wolf.
The company's regrouping there.

19:28.595 --> 19:32.155
-Is that understood?
-You better watch your back here.

19:32.355 --> 19:35.475
This ville is bullshit.
They're harboring VC.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.075
We'll bust some chops
before we leave.

19:38.315 --> 19:41.836
-Don't you worry.
-Torch the fucking place.

20:17.357 --> 20:22.196
Hey, hey, there it is.
My rack, my rack!

20:23.477 --> 20:25.317
So, what are you gonna do?

20:25.476 --> 20:29.717
Get shitfaced and go hump
the brains out of some hos.

20:29.876 --> 20:34.837
-I don't know. I'm too tired.
-Come on. Are we on duty or off?

20:35.957 --> 20:38.197
Let me have a beer.

20:38.437 --> 20:42.757
-No. You should have bought more.
-Give the guy a beer.

20:42.957 --> 20:44.997
-They're mine.
-I'll give you 1000 pi.

20:45.197 --> 20:48.397
-You should have thought ahead.
-10,000 pi.

20:48.677 --> 20:50.157
For one?

20:50.357 --> 20:52.837
Oreos. I'll give you some cookies.

20:53.077 --> 20:56.237
-I was hoping you were still around.
-Forget about it.

20:56.477 --> 20:59.158
We just spent some time
in a combat zone.

20:59.318 --> 21:03.118
The lieutenant had difficulty
getting his head out of his ass...

21:03.357 --> 21:07.958
...and left us in the jungle
like a bunch of crazed motherfuckers.

21:08.638 --> 21:12.718
-What happened to you guys?
-I don't think anybody knows.

21:12.878 --> 21:16.678
-I just about got killed, though.
-What was that like?

21:16.878 --> 21:17.997
I went nuts.

21:18.198 --> 21:19.798
-You wanna shower?
-Later.

21:19.998 --> 21:23.358
Come on, I want to shower.
Let's go shower.

21:26.759 --> 21:30.638
Hey, sarge.
It's the sarge.

21:30.838 --> 21:34.518
This asshole, Clark,
bought one beer off me...

21:34.719 --> 21:39.118
...for 10,000 pi.
Ain't that some shit?

21:39.318 --> 21:42.038
Sarge, are we on duty or off?

21:42.239 --> 21:44.559
-Off.
-Fucking-A.

21:46.319 --> 21:50.078
We've been detailed a long-range
recon in the morning.

21:50.319 --> 21:52.438
We're off till 2100.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.398
Where we gonna go?

21:56.759 --> 22:01.079
The lieutenant will brief me.
I'll brief you guys, 2100.

22:02.839 --> 22:04.439
We're out of here
at 0600.

22:04.639 --> 22:07.199
-We're off till then?
-Yeah.

22:07.399 --> 22:12.319
Sarge, we're gonna take a shower.
What are you gonna do?

22:12.919 --> 22:15.560
I'm gonna go into town and get laid.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.160
What do you hear
about Brownie?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.000
He's dead.

22:31.800 --> 22:36.240
This place is bullshit.
I hate this fucking place.

22:36.439 --> 22:40.920
-They ought to blow it up and pave--
-Fucking-A.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.680
Brownie could make me laugh, man.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.720
And I like to fucking laugh.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.321
You know...

22:56.401 --> 23:01.000
...I never knew a far-out spade dude
like Brownie before Brownie.

23:01.241 --> 23:04.680
They shouldn't make you hump the
boonies when you're short.

23:04.881 --> 23:06.360
They should send you home.

23:06.561 --> 23:09.841
You'd be short when you were close
to where you didn't have to go.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.240
-So what?
-So nobody'd want to go.

23:12.481 --> 23:14.601
I don't want to go now.

23:14.801 --> 23:16.601
They keep moving it back.

23:16.801 --> 23:19.921
Pretty soon they wouldn't
send anybody here.

23:20.121 --> 23:21.481
What's wrong with that?

23:21.681 --> 23:25.361
What I'm saying is these fucking gooks
are shit, man!

23:26.121 --> 23:28.122
They're lowlifes!

23:29.641 --> 23:31.761
Every motherfucker in that ville.

23:32.001 --> 23:35.441
Every man, woman and child knew
about the fucking mortars.

23:35.681 --> 23:39.681
They knew about the snipers,
and they just let them zap Brownie.

23:40.442 --> 23:42.281
They're slugs.

23:42.482 --> 23:47.682
They're roaches, and total destruction
is the only way to deal with them.

24:00.802 --> 24:03.482
Sorry, sarge. Passes are cancelled.

24:03.682 --> 24:04.642
What?

24:05.082 --> 24:08.163
-The ville's off-limits.
-What did he say?

24:08.362 --> 24:11.282
-For how long?
-Indefinitely.

24:13.722 --> 24:15.602
He's serious, man.

24:15.843 --> 24:17.522
Fuck 'em.

24:20.162 --> 24:22.363
-Watch it, sarge!
-Come on.

24:22.643 --> 24:24.683
-Motherfucking--
-Take it easy.

24:24.883 --> 24:26.002
That was easy!

24:26.203 --> 24:29.283
-Motherfucking easy!
-What we gonna do?

24:29.483 --> 24:31.603
Know what this shit's about?

24:31.803 --> 24:36.483
Fucking Cong is in town tonight.
Charlie's in the whorehouse.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.443
-No shit?
-Didn't you know?

24:39.683 --> 24:44.763
Charlie's gotta get laid too.
He works hard killing us. Don't he?

24:47.963 --> 24:52.243
What are we gonna do, sarge?
What are we gonna do?

24:54.323 --> 24:56.523
Goddamn it!

24:59.004 --> 25:01.444
The Cong's getting laid.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.604
And we're just....

25:04.803 --> 25:07.604
It ain't fair, you know?

25:13.004 --> 25:16.004
Am I talking?

25:16.844 --> 25:19.484
I can't tell
if I'm talking or not.

25:22.084 --> 25:24.364
Diaz, how you doing?

25:29.364 --> 25:33.045
Do one of you guys got a Playboy
on you I can borrow?

25:34.364 --> 25:37.484
-Jeez, on me?
-Yeah.

25:37.685 --> 25:40.924
-I gotta find one.
-Somebody sent you a present.

25:41.484 --> 25:44.085
This is Diaz.
He's Brown's replacement.

25:44.285 --> 25:46.924
We're out of here in the morning
at 0500.

25:47.565 --> 25:52.124
I want everyone carrying two frags.
Make sure you got smoke. Sit down.

25:54.085 --> 25:57.245
Leave your vest. I don't want
any heat casualties.

25:57.445 --> 26:00.725
Beyond that, wear what you want,
as long as it's charmed...

26:00.925 --> 26:03.766
...as long as it's helped you survive.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.965
Our destination is Hill 209
in the Tra Khuc Valley.

26:08.165 --> 26:09.526
The hill's here.

26:09.725 --> 26:12.085
There are caves,
there might be VC.

26:12.485 --> 26:16.766
We're looking for tunnels, bunkers,
unmapped trails, whatever.

26:17.005 --> 26:21.925
Now. The orders are we don't shoot
except in self-defence.

26:22.845 --> 26:27.006
You get one of these fuckers
out in the open, you waste him.

26:32.165 --> 26:37.846
We're leaving an hour early because
we detour 2000 metres to the south...

26:38.086 --> 26:40.126
...to the ville of Nghia Hanh.

26:40.606 --> 26:44.446
What we're gonna do is
requisition ourselves a girl.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.966
A little portable R and R.

26:47.806 --> 26:51.487
It'll break up the boredom,
keep up morale.

26:54.487 --> 26:59.046
I want charmed people around me.
So bring your good-luck stuff.

27:02.206 --> 27:03.647
Like this, sarge?

27:07.207 --> 27:08.806
Does it feel lucky?

27:11.047 --> 27:12.167
It looks lucky.

27:12.407 --> 27:14.287
He really say that?

27:15.167 --> 27:17.287
He wouldn't do it, would he?

27:17.767 --> 27:19.887
Bring a girl?

27:20.087 --> 27:23.327
Are you crazy?
As short as he is?

27:23.527 --> 27:27.128
He is out of here
in less than 30 days.

27:27.367 --> 27:29.407
So why did he say it?

27:32.007 --> 27:35.368
I don't know. What did
the other guys think?

27:36.807 --> 27:38.527
Everybody was joking.

27:41.967 --> 27:43.327
Clark says:

27:43.528 --> 27:46.328
"What's this, some new
addition to Lurp rations?"

27:46.527 --> 27:50.928
Right. I mean,
some broad in your pack.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.408
You see how nuts that sounds?

27:54.568 --> 27:56.848
That'll never happen, G.I.

29:06.490 --> 29:09.770
That is the one, sarge.
She's the pretty one.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.770
Take the pretty one.

29:19.730 --> 29:23.570
-Get over here, you fucking cunt!
-Jesus God!

29:32.370 --> 29:33.650
What's going on?

30:10.931 --> 30:13.052
You guys done this before?

30:14.051 --> 30:15.411
No.

30:21.091 --> 30:22.731
This is unbelievable.

30:24.771 --> 30:28.372
I didn't think he meant it, Hatch.
Did you?

30:30.572 --> 30:32.172
I don't know, man.

30:40.572 --> 30:43.852
I want to be out of
here by first light.

30:59.492 --> 31:01.932
What do you want?
What do you want?

31:04.932 --> 31:06.972
You want her to have this?

31:07.213 --> 31:10.493
All right, no sweat. No big thing.

31:10.692 --> 31:14.733
She can have it! Shut up, bitch!

31:17.213 --> 31:19.333
Let's get out of here, sarge.

31:19.733 --> 31:22.013
Get some rest. You're upset.

31:30.493 --> 31:34.934
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:38.175 --> 32:42.935
We're gonna win her heart and mind.
If she's got one.

32:50.655 --> 32:51.935
Hey, sarge.

32:52.975 --> 32:55.536
A few more clicks, we'll rest.

32:57.336 --> 33:01.536
-I thought you were kidding.
-I was serious as a heart attack.

33:01.816 --> 33:07.296
That's what I mean. This is
kidnapping, ain't it, sarge?

33:09.416 --> 33:11.095
Take the point.

33:11.816 --> 33:14.336
-Go relieve Hatch on point.
-Why?

33:14.616 --> 33:16.496
You got the point.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.776
-Go!
-Yeah. Right.

33:28.816 --> 33:32.577
Hatch, slow up. I'm
supposed to relieve you.

33:36.216 --> 33:39.137
It's just like Genghis Khan, man.

33:40.777 --> 33:42.457
That's what I was thinking.

33:42.697 --> 33:45.337
-Ever heard of Genghis Khan?
-What?

33:45.577 --> 33:49.417
-What are you talking about?
-Meserve is unbelievable.

33:49.657 --> 33:52.377
I mean, what we're doing...

33:52.617 --> 33:54.337
...it's fantastic.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.577
Why didn't we think of it before?

33:57.817 --> 34:02.017
-This is nuts.
-It ain't nuts. It's what armies do.

34:02.257 --> 34:05.657
-We ain't Genghis Khan.
-You're the one who's nuts.

34:06.297 --> 34:08.737
It's the 20th century, man.

34:09.338 --> 34:12.377
We're supposed to be here to help.

34:19.137 --> 34:22.338
I'm definitely gonna fuck this bitch.

34:28.938 --> 34:32.138
What's the matter with you?
Come here.

34:34.177 --> 34:39.217
Come here for a second. Come here.
You all right? You all right?

34:53.297 --> 34:55.297
That was some hump, huh?

35:01.699 --> 35:03.138
You want some gum?

35:06.099 --> 35:08.338
I'm not gonna hurt you.

35:10.658 --> 35:13.339
Do I have to mess with her?

35:15.259 --> 35:16.539
Diaz....

35:17.939 --> 35:19.299
No, man.

35:19.579 --> 35:21.059
Hey, come here.

35:21.299 --> 35:22.980
Come here, somebody.

35:23.419 --> 35:26.260
Somebody, come here, quick.

35:27.059 --> 35:30.380
-Come here.
-Check it out, Clark.

35:36.619 --> 35:39.380
-Is that a farmer or VC?
-Where?

35:39.540 --> 35:43.019
-In the pool.
-What is it, Clark?

35:43.260 --> 35:46.179
-It's a rock, I think.
-It's moving.

35:46.339 --> 35:49.179
The bushes are moving,
the rock ain't.

35:52.339 --> 35:56.300
-What are you doing?
-He said to shoot them in the open.

36:00.660 --> 36:02.940
It's a water buffalo, sarge.

36:04.941 --> 36:08.540
Dumb, very fucking dumb.

36:59.701 --> 37:02.902
Aspirin. Number one. Okay.

37:32.703 --> 37:37.262
Hey, sarge.
We on track?

37:39.342 --> 37:41.703
Just follow the red Crayola line.

37:41.942 --> 37:45.143
Two and a half hours
and we'll be there.

37:48.502 --> 37:51.743
Give me a minute
on this thing we're doing.

37:51.983 --> 37:56.543
I mean, what we're doing.
What are we doing, sarge?

38:01.823 --> 38:05.503
We have a VC suspect.
Is that what you mean?

38:09.383 --> 38:13.863
She's a VC whore and we're
gonna have fun with her.

38:14.303 --> 38:15.983
She's just a farm girl.

38:16.184 --> 38:20.343
You're the cherry here,
right? So lighten up.

38:20.504 --> 38:24.504
-Let me carry the weight.
-What's the problem, sarge?

38:24.823 --> 38:27.904
He don't think our
VC whore is a VC whore.

38:28.104 --> 38:32.064
You've been in town.
They'll sell their children.

38:32.264 --> 38:35.224
These people were
sleeping in their hootch.

38:36.744 --> 38:39.704
He got the wrong
outlook on this thing.

38:39.904 --> 38:42.344
You got the wrong outlook.

38:44.624 --> 38:47.744
-What are you talking about?
-She's a VC.

38:49.225 --> 38:52.864
-She ain't.
-I'm telling you, Eriksson.

38:55.785 --> 38:59.105
This ain't a VC. Clark ain't.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.504
Hatcher, he ain't no VC.

39:08.505 --> 39:10.385
Diaz ain't no VC.

39:15.745 --> 39:18.545
I ain't. I ain't no fucking VC.

39:18.945 --> 39:20.145
Now this?

39:26.425 --> 39:28.545
This here's a VC.

39:33.825 --> 39:35.026
And you?

39:36.346 --> 39:38.505
You I don't know about.

39:54.026 --> 39:57.466
You ain't cutting
yourself this slack, man.

39:57.706 --> 40:00.546
You ain't humping your ruck,
hump mine.

40:00.706 --> 40:02.546
-Why, man?
-Just put it on.

40:02.786 --> 40:03.906
Hey, sarge!

40:04.186 --> 40:07.466
Hey! I'm a corporal, Hatcher.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.546
This is a direct order.

40:10.066 --> 40:11.546
You hump my ruck.

40:18.106 --> 40:21.347
Oh, man. What an asshole!

41:55.549 --> 41:57.549
It's all clear, sarge.

41:58.589 --> 42:02.549
The stream's 30 metres
down. Plenty of water.

42:04.630 --> 42:08.750
Get her inside. Get your
ruck off her, Hatcher.

42:09.589 --> 42:12.830
We'll use this place as our C.P.

42:13.029 --> 42:17.149
Eriksson, you and Diaz get
the chow and ammo stored.

42:23.350 --> 42:26.350
Clark, you and Hatcher come with me.

42:44.230 --> 42:46.591
I ain't gonna rape nobody.

42:47.430 --> 42:49.670
You gotta back me up.

42:51.750 --> 42:54.350
-I'll back you.
-Swear it.

42:55.351 --> 42:58.751
I do, man. I promise.

42:59.230 --> 43:01.231
You gotta back me too.

43:01.470 --> 43:03.510
You got it, man.

43:30.951 --> 43:33.872
I'm not gonna hurt you.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.672
You're cut. You're hurt.

43:35.912 --> 43:40.352
Let me fix it, okay?
No, no, give.

43:50.672 --> 43:52.431
We'll get it clean.

44:01.192 --> 44:03.552
I'm not going to hurt you.

44:05.392 --> 44:06.673
Shh! Come here.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.392
Stay still.

44:17.593 --> 44:19.872
See?

44:26.833 --> 44:28.753
It's going to be okay.

44:34.193 --> 44:37.953
Okay, I'm your friend.
I'm your friend.

44:59.594 --> 45:01.634
Mind if I pull up a chair?

45:03.314 --> 45:04.794
Go ahead.

45:07.193 --> 45:09.913
C-rats, huh? What you got there?

45:10.114 --> 45:13.554
-Franks and beans.
-Army don't want to surprise us.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.954
Leave that to the dinks.

45:18.634 --> 45:19.994
How you doing?

45:21.555 --> 45:22.914
I'm all right.

45:24.954 --> 45:27.554
I'm sorry I jumped on you back there.

45:29.034 --> 45:33.554
We're out here with the Cong
hanging in every tree...

45:33.794 --> 45:35.714
...waiting to grease us.

45:35.915 --> 45:38.354
Humping six hours of the worst bush.

45:38.635 --> 45:43.475
Gooks should be fighting to get
out of here, not to keep it.

45:44.115 --> 45:47.955
Six hours of the ugliest
snakes and spiders.

45:49.155 --> 45:53.155
All we have is each other. Right?

45:54.795 --> 45:56.155
Yeah.

45:58.795 --> 46:00.115
Come here.

46:16.315 --> 46:19.156
I don't want any problems with you.

46:20.236 --> 46:23.756
I'm counting on you in particular.

46:24.716 --> 46:27.756
I don't know what's going on here.

46:28.956 --> 46:30.356
We're gonna...

46:31.436 --> 46:33.396
...interrogate the prisoner.

46:34.636 --> 46:35.956
This isn't right.

46:37.316 --> 46:39.676
We ain't supposed to do this.

46:40.516 --> 46:43.876
Don't fuck with me.
You're taking your turn.

46:44.116 --> 46:46.076
I ain't raping nobody.

46:46.316 --> 46:48.156
You're saying no to me?

46:48.556 --> 46:51.276
You ain't hotshot enough to say no.

46:51.517 --> 46:54.077
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

46:54.316 --> 46:56.756
Think you're standing up to me?

46:57.237 --> 46:59.437
I ain't doing it. No way.

46:59.677 --> 47:03.876
Don't you like girls? You ain't
got a pair? Is that your problem?

47:04.117 --> 47:07.557
-Sarge?
-He don't want to ball the dink.

47:07.996 --> 47:09.837
-Chickenshit.
-Is that it?

47:10.036 --> 47:12.037
Is that your problem?

47:12.916 --> 47:14.797
-No.
-So, what is it?

47:15.037 --> 47:17.157
-Maybe he's queer.
-You a faggot?

47:18.157 --> 47:19.717
-Is that it?
-No!

47:20.197 --> 47:24.197
So, what is it?
Everybody else is up for this.

47:28.037 --> 47:29.957
What are you looking at Diaz for?

47:30.957 --> 47:33.878
He's with the program.
You got a problem?

47:38.398 --> 47:40.038
-Hell, no.
-Okay.

47:43.397 --> 47:46.397
Would you stop looking at Diaz?

47:47.118 --> 47:50.558
Oh, wait a minute.
Maybe he is a queer.

47:52.318 --> 47:54.758
Maybe Eriksson's a homosexual.

47:55.758 --> 47:59.118
We got us two gals.
Is Eriksson a faggot?

47:59.399 --> 48:01.278
-I don't know.
-I think so.

48:02.398 --> 48:05.758
He's chickenshit.
I'm gonna cut his heart out.

48:05.959 --> 48:09.959
How we gonna count on you?
You're a VC sympathizer.

48:10.199 --> 48:12.559
You could get killed real easy.

48:14.039 --> 48:17.798
Somebody stumbles....
They don't mean to shoot you.

48:18.039 --> 48:22.799
Friendly fucking casualty.
I mean, a body bag's a body bag.

48:23.438 --> 48:26.558
Your mama and your daddy are crying.

48:26.759 --> 48:29.359
-He's dead.
-What?

48:30.879 --> 48:35.959
-My father's dead.
-Nobody cares about your history.

48:36.799 --> 48:39.559
You're taking your turn.
In there.

48:43.960 --> 48:48.559
Maybe when I'm done with her,
I'm gonna come after you.

48:49.560 --> 48:53.400
When I'm done humping her,
I'm gonna hump you!

48:57.360 --> 49:00.360
You're taking an
attack posture with me?

49:05.360 --> 49:07.480
Yeah, you got a weapon.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.999
Clark got a weapon. He's got a knife.

49:11.240 --> 49:14.760
We all got weapons.
Anybody can blow anybody away...

49:15.200 --> 49:16.760
...any second.

49:18.360 --> 49:21.720
Which is the way
it ought to be. Always.

49:33.120 --> 49:35.160
The Army calls this a weapon.

49:36.201 --> 49:37.760
But it ain't.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.761
This is a weapon.

49:46.321 --> 49:48.521
This is a gun.

49:50.001 --> 49:51.881
This is for fighting.

49:52.721 --> 49:54.561
This is for fun.

50:22.762 --> 50:24.562
Are you gonna watch?

50:27.402 --> 50:29.362
Take security, Eriksson.

50:29.802 --> 50:31.562
You got security.

50:39.722 --> 50:42.962
-Who's next, man?
-Not you, man!

50:43.162 --> 50:45.362
I wish we had some beers.

50:45.603 --> 50:48.162
I'd really like an ice-cold beer.

51:00.442 --> 51:02.362
Better than nothing.

51:02.563 --> 51:06.563
Wish we had a beer.
Don't you wish you had a beer?

51:07.443 --> 51:09.202
Are we gonna flip a coin?

51:09.443 --> 51:12.443
-Diaz is next.
-When am I up, sarge?

51:12.683 --> 51:16.643
-After Clark.
-That's last.

51:16.883 --> 51:18.763
Move it, Diaz, move it!

51:20.564 --> 51:23.243
We ought to have some goddamn beers.

51:23.483 --> 51:27.684
-Shut the fuck up.
-I just want a beer, man.

51:27.923 --> 51:31.283
We should gag her.
We'll have VC all over our case.

52:07.924 --> 52:11.364
Hatcher manages three strokes,
then he goes--

52:13.765 --> 52:15.245
--Iike a fucking mouse.

52:15.444 --> 52:18.365
Clark had his knife to her throat.

52:18.604 --> 52:20.005
So what?

52:22.444 --> 52:23.885
What do you mean?

52:27.644 --> 52:31.005
When is the last time
you had a real woman?

52:32.965 --> 52:34.565
She was real.

52:36.165 --> 52:37.965
I think she was real.

52:39.645 --> 52:42.085
My brother had this car, man.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.525
It was a '57 Chevy Bel Air.

52:45.765 --> 52:47.565
Raked, nosed.

52:48.965 --> 52:53.565
Had 10 coats of hand-rubbed
candy-apple-red lacquer.

52:54.366 --> 52:56.366
The coolest.

52:57.646 --> 53:01.166
It had a 283 in it, bored and stroked.

53:01.365 --> 53:03.725
The fastest
thing in the street!

53:18.526 --> 53:21.366
Diaz will relieve you at 2400, okay?

53:34.247 --> 53:37.087
You probably like the Army, don't you?

53:42.167 --> 53:43.967
I hate the Army.

53:48.847 --> 53:51.487
This ain't the Army.

53:53.207 --> 53:55.327
This ain't the Army, sarge.

54:04.727 --> 54:09.167
Yea, though I walk
through the valley of evil...

54:09.368 --> 54:11.367
...I shall fear no death.

54:17.207 --> 54:20.728
'Cause I'm the meanest
motherfucker in the valley.

54:40.328 --> 54:43.249
It's a bunch of them little people.

54:45.368 --> 54:47.209
There you go.

54:47.448 --> 54:50.968
What do you think?
You want to light them up?

55:15.849 --> 55:18.569
There's something happening here.

55:18.809 --> 55:21.090
Maybe they're just fishing.

55:27.089 --> 55:29.690
You two get back to the hootch.

55:29.929 --> 55:32.929
Load up on extra ammo
and smoke grenades.

55:33.169 --> 55:35.890
Diaz, get Big Brother. I want support.

55:36.130 --> 55:37.810
Didi mau, gentlemen.

55:40.490 --> 55:44.009
Big Brother 0-2,
this is Silent Twin 0-2.

55:54.050 --> 55:56.690
Fucking bullshit, man.

55:56.890 --> 56:02.050
What did I do to deserve this?
I'm sick of babysitting this whore.

56:10.490 --> 56:11.890
What's happening?

56:12.091 --> 56:15.690
-Meserve wants ammo.
-We're gonna light them up.

56:15.931 --> 56:18.610
-Where's Meserve?
-He's at the ridge.

56:18.811 --> 56:20.291
What do I do, man?

56:20.490 --> 56:24.371
Babysit the whore
while you guys waste some gooks?

56:29.371 --> 56:31.091
What'd he say about me?

56:33.491 --> 56:35.851
He didn't say anything.

56:36.091 --> 56:39.291
All right, man. I'm saying it.

56:39.491 --> 56:41.531
I'm going up there, man.

56:41.771 --> 56:44.691
Eriksson, you stay here.

56:45.292 --> 56:49.491
-I'm supposed to go.
-I'm going up there and get some.

56:49.731 --> 56:52.291
I ain't gonna miss this. You ready?

56:52.491 --> 56:56.892
-Meserve won't like this.
-I'm a corporal. You're a PFC.

56:57.131 --> 57:00.372
Now you stay here.
Give me the thump gun.

57:04.651 --> 57:08.092
-Let's didi, Hatch.
-We're gonna K.I.A. some VC.

57:08.372 --> 57:10.092
Fucking-A.

57:53.053 --> 57:54.933
No more.

57:59.053 --> 58:01.934
No more. I'm not gonna hurt you.

58:09.133 --> 58:11.733
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

58:11.973 --> 58:14.893
I just want to untie you. All right?

58:22.614 --> 58:24.094
Just a minute.

58:25.494 --> 58:26.894
Okay.

58:35.734 --> 58:37.574
Oh, God!

58:42.374 --> 58:44.094
I'm sorry.

58:51.054 --> 58:52.854
My friends...

58:54.135 --> 58:55.655
...number 10.

58:59.535 --> 59:02.095
You're sick, huh?

59:02.454 --> 59:04.094
You're sick?

59:08.655 --> 59:10.135
It's okay.

59:16.895 --> 59:20.015
Oh, man, you're burning up.

59:23.495 --> 59:25.296
You're hot.

59:28.456 --> 59:30.896
You hungry? Hungry, food?

59:31.095 --> 59:36.296
Eat, okay? Number one.
Get you something to eat.

59:38.375 --> 59:40.656
Okay? Okay.

59:42.576 --> 59:46.096
Number one. It's good, it's good.

01:00:02.656 --> 01:00:04.296
It's okay. Good.

01:00:09.256 --> 01:00:12.296
Okay, okay, take it easy.

01:00:20.297 --> 01:00:22.417
I don't understand.

01:00:29.777 --> 01:00:32.977
I don't know what you're saying.

01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:36.697
I don't know what you're saying.

01:00:55.297 --> 01:00:58.098
-What's happening?
-Why are you here?

01:00:58.298 --> 01:01:01.018
-Shit's happening.
-Where's Eriksson?

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:05.177
-In the hootch.
-You left him alone with the whore?

01:01:05.418 --> 01:01:06.537
Are you nuts?

01:01:06.778 --> 01:01:11.698
Go get him up here. Get everybody
and everything up here ASAP.

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:14.138
I gotta do everything?

01:01:44.099 --> 01:01:47.699
I'm gonna take you out of here. Okay?

01:01:47.939 --> 01:01:50.819
You. You.

01:01:51.059 --> 01:01:55.579
You, me, we go.
We're gonna didi. Okay?

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.900
We're gonna go home.

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:15.979
Home.

01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:19.860
We go home in the ville. Ville.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.501
Thank God.

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.980
Okay, that's right. We're going home.

01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.581
Wait a minute.

01:03:00.581 --> 01:03:04.501
I can't go. You go. Go, go!

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:08.261
I can't go! I'll be a goddamn deserter.

01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:11.861
Go! Go!

01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:20.341
No, I'm sorry! I can't do this!

01:03:20.581 --> 01:03:22.501
You don't understand!

01:03:30.062 --> 01:03:32.901
Oh, Jesus. Okay.

01:03:47.302 --> 01:03:49.222
What are you doing?

01:03:51.182 --> 01:03:53.142
Nothing, man.

01:03:54.422 --> 01:03:56.102
Nothing.

01:03:58.343 --> 01:04:00.702
Meserve wants everybody up top.

01:04:56.783 --> 01:04:58.904
Shut the fuck up!

01:05:03.864 --> 01:05:07.304
She'll give us away
with all that coughing.

01:05:10.544 --> 01:05:13.904
We gotta waste her.
She'll get us lit up.

01:05:20.424 --> 01:05:24.904
-Eriksson, waste the bitch.
-What?

01:05:25.864 --> 01:05:28.224
You heard me. Grease her.

01:05:30.104 --> 01:05:31.705
Another boat, sarge.

01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:41.705
Get Reilly. I want that support.
Slicks, snakes, everything.

01:05:41.945 --> 01:05:43.945
Right, sarge.

01:05:44.265 --> 01:05:48.145
Big Brother 0-2,
this is Silent Twin 0-2, over.

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:50.305
I want you to waste her.

01:05:50.745 --> 01:05:53.785
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:05:55.905 --> 01:05:58.905
-Kill the bitch.
-You're nuts!

01:05:59.065 --> 01:06:01.785
Brownie would kick your ass on this.

01:06:01.985 --> 01:06:04.906
He would not tolerate this bullshit!

01:06:05.105 --> 01:06:07.906
Brownie ain't on my frequency no more.

01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:11.665
Brownie's dead.
You on my frequency, motherfucker?

01:06:11.945 --> 01:06:15.306
If you ain't, you're K.I.A.,
just like the gooks.

01:06:16.026 --> 01:06:20.305
Let her go, sarge!
What she gonna do, man? Let her go!

01:06:21.306 --> 01:06:23.706
-Hatcher, waste her.
-What?

01:06:24.026 --> 01:06:26.946
-I'll do it.
-No, Hatcher's gonna do it.

01:06:27.186 --> 01:06:31.026
-Why me?
-You piece of shit. You do what I say.

01:06:31.266 --> 01:06:32.986
I don't want to.

01:06:37.266 --> 01:06:39.266
Choppers, sarge.

01:06:39.906 --> 01:06:41.426
Goddamn it!

01:06:44.746 --> 01:06:46.826
They're gonna see her.

01:06:48.227 --> 01:06:50.066
We gotta get rid of her.

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:53.147
We'll have every bird
circling this area.

01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:54.706
Diaz!

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:57.827
-Do it!
-I'll do it, sarge.

01:06:58.067 --> 01:07:01.306
-Diaz is gonna do it. Do it!
-Diaz, no, man.

01:07:01.507 --> 01:07:05.027
-You yellow piece of shit! Be a man!
-Don't do it.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:09.147
-Be a man! Do it! Do it!
-Don't do it!

01:07:10.347 --> 01:07:12.987
-Do it!
-Don't let him make you.

01:07:13.187 --> 01:07:15.147
-Don't do it, man!
-Do it!

01:07:15.827 --> 01:07:19.027
Do it!
You fucking piece of shit, do it!

01:07:19.227 --> 01:07:22.827
-Diaz! Diaz!
-Do it! Do it!

01:07:23.027 --> 01:07:25.227
-Do it!
-Diaz! No!

01:07:28.747 --> 01:07:32.508
You don't have to worry
about her coughing anymore!

01:07:47.428 --> 01:07:50.107
Eriksson, you stay here!

01:07:50.348 --> 01:07:52.708
Everybody else move! You cover!

01:07:52.988 --> 01:07:55.108
Now we're in the shit.

01:07:55.548 --> 01:07:59.149
Take no names and count the bodies!

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:35.589
What the hell is that? Look, sarge!

01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:39.309
It's a gunboat.

01:08:40.868 --> 01:08:42.509
I fixed her, sarge.

01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:04.510
Everybody, move! Right flank!
Right flank!

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:08.510
Switch with me, Hatch. Go!

01:09:30.711 --> 01:09:34.510
Get some, motherfuckers! Get some!

01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:10.191
Oh, God!

01:10:17.111 --> 01:10:19.552
-She's getting away!
-No! No!

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:25.232
She's getting away!

01:10:25.792 --> 01:10:27.512
She's getting away!

01:10:27.712 --> 01:10:32.232
That bitch!
I stuck her more than twice!

01:10:37.632 --> 01:10:39.392
Waste her!

01:10:39.593 --> 01:10:41.793
-No! Stop it!
-Waste her!

01:10:45.353 --> 01:10:46.952
Shoot her!

01:10:50.352 --> 01:10:52.112
Shoot her!

01:10:54.552 --> 01:10:56.593
Shoot her!

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:21.113
Let's make our hat!

01:14:11.077 --> 01:14:13.198
Rowan! Rowan!

01:14:14.757 --> 01:14:17.917
They did it.
We didn't think they would...

01:14:18.158 --> 01:14:20.517
...but they did. They killed her.

01:14:20.677 --> 01:14:23.998
-The girl?
-This ain't supposed to happen.

01:14:26.277 --> 01:14:30.198
We go into this ville.
We just march in...

01:14:30.398 --> 01:14:33.118
...and they take this girl.

01:14:33.318 --> 01:14:35.798
They fucked her and killed her.

01:14:36.078 --> 01:14:37.398
Jesus Christ.

01:14:37.638 --> 01:14:40.638
I mean, this ain't supposed to happen.

01:14:41.278 --> 01:14:43.358
Hatcher's talking....

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:47.438
Hatcher's talking about Genghis Khan.

01:14:47.678 --> 01:14:50.278
-Meserve said I'm K.I.A.
-And Clark?

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:51.919
-He's nuts.
-He's here.

01:14:52.319 --> 01:14:56.119
Eriksson, what are you
talking to him about?

01:14:58.079 --> 01:15:00.759
I'm allowed to be talking to him.

01:15:00.998 --> 01:15:04.639
What happens in the field
stays in the field, man.

01:15:04.919 --> 01:15:08.279
You know that. Everybody knows that.

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:14.799
Clarkie, where's Meserve? Is he back?

01:15:16.759 --> 01:15:20.199
What happened? You disappeared.

01:15:20.759 --> 01:15:22.880
I got choppered out, Clark.

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:26.320
-We have to regroup--
-Don't pull at me!

01:15:26.519 --> 01:15:28.839
Don't pull at me.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.520
Reilly said in an hour.

01:15:31.719 --> 01:15:34.439
-I'll be there.
-You better be, cherry.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.960
Victor Charles Cong is hardcore.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.720
They said that we were on alert.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.520
I said, "I am always on alert."

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.840
-Did you see him, man?
-That was freaky, man.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.720
They get me back in the bush,
I'm coming back in a bag.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.000
You gotta tell somebody.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.120
Who do you think?

01:15:56.361 --> 01:15:59.400
-Tell Reilly.
-Hill's the captain.

01:15:59.641 --> 01:16:02.080
You should tell Reilly first.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.960
All right.

01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:08.561
On the day I was born,
my mama grunted.

01:16:08.801 --> 01:16:12.401
I popped out. Took one look around.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.120
"Shit," I says,
"it's Two Creeks, Texas."

01:16:18.961 --> 01:16:23.081
So about eight years ago
I'm still in Two Creeks.

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:26.601
My wife's about to have
our first child.

01:16:26.841 --> 01:16:30.601
I took her to the hospital,
a natural thing to do.

01:16:30.881 --> 01:16:36.041
She was refused admittance to this
hospital on the basis of her race.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:41.521
Which is, as you might guess, Negro.

01:16:42.282 --> 01:16:45.722
Next thing I know,
the baby ain't about to wait.

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:49.321
So my son is born
on the goddamn floor...

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:52.321
...of this hospital's reception room.

01:16:54.162 --> 01:16:58.322
Eriksson, I flipped the fuck out.

01:16:59.362 --> 01:17:02.522
I started turning over chairs...

01:17:02.722 --> 01:17:04.722
...kicking lamps.

01:17:04.882 --> 01:17:08.122
It wasn't long before I was in jail.

01:17:10.402 --> 01:17:15.242
Now wasn't I on the side
of righteousness?

01:17:20.362 --> 01:17:22.722
So, what was I doing in jail?

01:17:24.403 --> 01:17:28.962
What I was doing, let me advise you...

01:17:29.762 --> 01:17:34.162
...was fixing to shoot some
motherfuckers in that hospital.

01:17:35.163 --> 01:17:37.363
That's what I was doing.

01:17:38.723 --> 01:17:40.563
But you know what?

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:43.643
It was like they read my mind...

01:17:43.882 --> 01:17:48.883
...and they kept me in that jail
until my mind was turned around.

01:17:49.363 --> 01:17:52.523
When I got out, I only wanted to see...

01:17:52.763 --> 01:17:55.883
...my baby and my wife.

01:18:02.883 --> 01:18:05.843
And I started thinking to myself...

01:18:07.324 --> 01:18:11.723
...what happened is the way things are.

01:18:12.244 --> 01:18:16.523
So why try and buck the system?

01:18:19.644 --> 01:18:21.804
This is what I'm gonna do.

01:18:23.164 --> 01:18:27.964
I'm gonna break up the squad,
send you in different directions.

01:18:29.764 --> 01:18:33.924
-I think this is--
-No, you don't think. You listen.

01:18:34.564 --> 01:18:39.324
You'd best just relax and try
to forget about this thing.

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:44.844
You can't expect anything else
in the combat zone.

01:18:46.925 --> 01:18:48.924
Is that clear?

01:18:52.925 --> 01:18:56.324
Sir. Yes, sir.

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:09.724
I got some boneless chicken
I'll trade for some pound cake.

01:19:10.005 --> 01:19:14.525
-We'd kill to keep our pound cake.
-Everybody says that.

01:19:14.805 --> 01:19:18.925
In fact, we have killed
to keep our pound cake.

01:19:27.565 --> 01:19:31.045
If you was me,
what would you have done?

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.325
What do you mean, man?

01:19:34.285 --> 01:19:38.285
I mean, if you were me,
what would you have done?

01:19:38.525 --> 01:19:40.246
I don't know.

01:19:42.726 --> 01:19:45.726
There was this one minute, you know?

01:19:45.966 --> 01:19:48.286
I had this chance.

01:19:49.526 --> 01:19:54.526
I could have got her out of there.
We both could have taken off.

01:19:55.126 --> 01:19:59.806
And then Clark-- What was I
supposed to do? Waste a corporal?

01:20:00.086 --> 01:20:04.007
-No, man.
-Just blow away four Americans?

01:20:04.287 --> 01:20:05.807
-No.
-What then?

01:20:06.047 --> 01:20:08.326
Guys, I can't find my squad.

01:20:10.047 --> 01:20:11.367
Why are you here?

01:20:11.567 --> 01:20:14.886
-I can't find Wilkins.
-Find any pound cake?

01:20:15.127 --> 01:20:18.007
-No, just chicken.
-Where is yours?

01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:21.287
Somebody stole it.
Can I stay with you?

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:22.927
Yeah, back there.

01:20:23.127 --> 01:20:27.727
I should have gone to Captain Hill.
He'd straighten this out.

01:20:28.007 --> 01:20:32.007
When we reconnoitre to those caves,
do you think--

01:20:32.207 --> 01:20:34.687
Private, move out.

01:20:36.407 --> 01:20:39.447
-You told Reilly?
-Reilly's bullshit.

01:20:39.647 --> 01:20:43.928
No, I gotta see Captain Hill.
He'll square this shit away.

01:20:44.087 --> 01:20:47.127
Don't go around
your immediate superior.

01:20:47.328 --> 01:20:49.928
If I do nothing, she'd just vanish.

01:20:50.127 --> 01:20:52.408
There's a chain of command.

01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:56.287
I wouldn't violate something
so sacred for a murder.

01:20:56.567 --> 01:20:58.887
What are you talking about?

01:21:00.407 --> 01:21:02.528
Don't worry about it.

01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:08.288
I better go. I feel like
I'm doing something wrong.

01:21:08.568 --> 01:21:10.528
I'll see you later.

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:18.768
You won't see us later if you don't
stop bopping around here.

01:21:20.328 --> 01:21:23.928
Just take it easy, okay? Slow down.

01:21:26.409 --> 01:21:28.368
Tough. There he goes.

01:21:28.609 --> 01:21:32.488
-Pathetic.
-He ain't rendezvoused with his brain--

01:21:34.329 --> 01:21:36.729
Cease fire! Cease fire!

01:21:37.448 --> 01:21:39.129
What's the haps, sarge?

01:21:39.289 --> 01:21:42.648
Booby trap.
Somebody stepped on a toe-popper.

01:21:42.849 --> 01:21:45.089
All right, let's move it out.

01:21:45.329 --> 01:21:48.529
-Who got hit, sarge?
-Cherry.

01:21:48.809 --> 01:21:52.489
That boy was bagged
the minute they sent him here.

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:55.729
They should have
just shot him at home.

01:21:55.929 --> 01:21:57.729
Okay, let's move out.

01:22:00.889 --> 01:22:03.889
Get your people out of here. Let's go.

01:22:05.329 --> 01:22:07.410
Oh, Jesus!

01:22:16.369 --> 01:22:18.410
Pathetic, dumb-ass Cherry.

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:20.370
Wait a minute.

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:24.770
This goddamn thing
is turning us on our heads.

01:22:25.969 --> 01:22:28.130
We're getting it backwards.

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:31.130
Because every day
is a dose of bullshit.

01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:34.250
Just because we could
all be blown away...

01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:37.650
...everybody's acting like
we can do anything.

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.611
And it don't matter what we do.

01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:47.130
But I think it's the other way around.
The main thing is the opposite.

01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:50.570
Because we might die
in the next second...

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:54.171
...maybe we gotta
be extra careful what we do.

01:22:54.891 --> 01:22:57.411
Because maybe it matters more.

01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:02.931
Maybe it matters more
than we even know.

01:23:19.572 --> 01:23:23.412
-PFC Eriksson reporting, sir.
-At ease, Eriksson.

01:23:23.652 --> 01:23:26.371
Captain Hill, something happened--

01:23:26.571 --> 01:23:29.172
I'm aware of why you're here.

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:34.571
Lt. Reilly detailed it to me
just after you brought it to him.

01:23:35.371 --> 01:23:36.932
I didn't know that, sir.

01:23:37.131 --> 01:23:39.732
That just about cover it, trooper?

01:23:39.972 --> 01:23:43.092
I am max-attentive to this situation.

01:23:43.372 --> 01:23:44.932
Yes, sir.

01:23:47.652 --> 01:23:49.932
Is there someone I should speak to?

01:23:50.132 --> 01:23:53.052
Has the investigation started?

01:23:55.612 --> 01:23:59.292
I hope you understand how serious
this situation is.

01:23:59.972 --> 01:24:03.412
Yes, sir.
That's why I reported it, sir.

01:24:03.693 --> 01:24:08.052
This could cause a major international
incident. Do you know that?

01:24:08.572 --> 01:24:10.332
Yes, sir.

01:24:13.133 --> 01:24:15.532
These men fucked up good...

01:24:15.812 --> 01:24:19.173
...but you bringing
formal charges against them...

01:24:19.453 --> 01:24:22.853
...is that gonna help that girl
one little bit?

01:24:25.413 --> 01:24:28.213
Maybe if you had been there, sir.

01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:31.253
If you heard her scream--

01:24:31.493 --> 01:24:36.573
Don't tell me shit about screaming!
I've heard a lot of fucking screaming!

01:24:36.853 --> 01:24:40.253
Most of it's come from
wounded American boys.

01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:47.694
I'm gonna transfer you out
of my company. That okay?

01:24:47.974 --> 01:24:52.654
I'll get you out of the bush,
any fucking place you want to go.

01:24:54.414 --> 01:24:56.894
I saw your 201 file in the rear.

01:24:57.174 --> 01:25:01.333
You volunteered to be a tunnel rat.
Is that what you want?

01:25:01.613 --> 01:25:03.813
I want out of this company.

01:25:04.094 --> 01:25:07.134
Well, that's a rog.
You're a tunnel rat.

01:25:07.374 --> 01:25:10.014
It won't keep me
from bringing this out.

01:25:10.174 --> 01:25:14.294
Nobody's trying to keep you
from doing a goddamn thing.

01:25:14.814 --> 01:25:19.254
My function here is just to tell you
how this will come down.

01:25:19.894 --> 01:25:22.054
And you ought to be advised...

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:25.534
...that military
court-martials are lenient.

01:25:25.735 --> 01:25:29.375
And stateside review boards
are even more lenient.

01:25:29.614 --> 01:25:33.935
If these guys get convicted
they won't do any real time.

01:25:34.615 --> 01:25:35.735
Yes, sir.

01:25:36.015 --> 01:25:39.975
They'll be out of the stockade
before you know it.

01:25:40.215 --> 01:25:42.695
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off.

01:25:42.935 --> 01:25:46.095
I'd be looking for payback!

01:25:47.095 --> 01:25:51.135
Now, a man like you,
wife, baby daughter...

01:25:51.335 --> 01:25:55.095
...I'd be considering
those factors very carefully.

01:25:57.375 --> 01:26:00.655
Pardon me, sir.
What's your point, sir?

01:26:01.815 --> 01:26:04.376
There ain't no point, Eriksson.

01:26:04.615 --> 01:26:09.375
I'm just illuminating the terrain
in which we find ourselves deployed.

01:26:09.616 --> 01:26:12.535
You don't mind.
And if you do, fuck you!

01:26:12.736 --> 01:26:15.535
-You on my frequency?
-Yes, sir.

01:26:15.815 --> 01:26:18.576
You maggot! Who do you think you are?

01:26:18.776 --> 01:26:21.576
You recommended Meserve
for a Bronze Star!

01:26:21.856 --> 01:26:24.936
He pulled you out of a VC tunnel, boy!

01:26:25.216 --> 01:26:27.175
What he did was wrong.

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:31.376
But he's a kid.
He's 20 goddamn years old!

01:26:31.616 --> 01:26:36.176
And you're gonna ruin his life?
He saved yours!

01:27:51.658 --> 01:27:54.738
No, man, no!

01:27:56.538 --> 01:27:58.458
Now listen to me, man.

01:27:58.698 --> 01:28:01.938
Just don't get too happy
with those dice.

01:28:02.138 --> 01:28:06.338
-I'll be there in two seconds.
-Okay. All right.

01:28:07.899 --> 01:28:09.938
Hey, Clarkie!

01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:12.459
What?

01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:57.420
-Charlie's in the wire!
-What the hell's going on?

01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:00.020
Christ! What was it?

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.620
Who was on watch?

01:29:01.859 --> 01:29:03.900
Anybody still in there?

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.740
Get that fire out over there.

01:30:03.942 --> 01:30:06.061
You sick son of a bitch!

01:30:15.062 --> 01:30:17.782
I told you, cherry.
What happens--

01:30:24.182 --> 01:30:26.382
Nobody cares, Meserve.

01:30:29.502 --> 01:30:33.102
Oh, I told everybody.
You don't have to worry.

01:30:33.342 --> 01:30:35.262
You don't have to kill me.

01:30:39.822 --> 01:30:42.942
I told them, and they don't care!

01:30:43.463 --> 01:30:45.663
You dinky dau, man.

01:30:46.222 --> 01:30:48.503
You beaucoup dinky dau!

01:31:43.344 --> 01:31:44.944
How you doing, son?

01:31:46.704 --> 01:31:48.144
Sir.

01:31:49.744 --> 01:31:51.424
I'm sorry, sir.

01:31:51.744 --> 01:31:53.184
Drunk, sir.

01:31:53.864 --> 01:31:55.784
Mind if I join you?

01:31:56.624 --> 01:31:58.745
Drunk. Very drunk, sir.

01:31:59.504 --> 01:32:01.224
You going on leave?

01:32:04.584 --> 01:32:08.425
Getting transferred, sir.
Fini boonies.

01:32:10.945 --> 01:32:13.625
This little darling
must be your daughter.

01:32:17.185 --> 01:32:20.704
You're not gonna do anything
crazy with that gun, are you?

01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:25.105
Just protecting myself, sir.

01:32:26.825 --> 01:32:28.785
I gotta protect myself.

01:32:34.065 --> 01:32:36.025
Trouble at home, son?

01:32:38.065 --> 01:32:39.625
Pardon, sir?

01:32:40.385 --> 01:32:45.305
I thought maybe you had problems
at home, sickness in the family.

01:32:49.265 --> 01:32:52.026
The answer's not in that can, son.

01:32:53.426 --> 01:32:56.385
Are you sure, sir?

01:32:56.666 --> 01:33:01.346
I'm a chaplain. Try me.
That's what I do.

01:33:02.586 --> 01:33:05.106
You a chaplain, sir?

01:33:06.386 --> 01:33:09.506
Are you religious, son?
I'm a Methodist.

01:33:12.786 --> 01:33:14.786
I'm a Lutheran.

01:33:16.146 --> 01:33:18.267
We can still talk, can't we?

01:33:28.827 --> 01:33:33.067
I went on a long-range patrol, sir.

01:33:36.707 --> 01:33:40.467
And we kidnapped a girl...

01:33:42.307 --> 01:33:43.947
...from a village.

01:33:47.907 --> 01:33:50.107
And the other four men...

01:33:51.267 --> 01:33:52.627
...raped her.

01:33:53.747 --> 01:33:55.947
And they murdered her.

01:34:00.427 --> 01:34:04.987
And I failed, sir...

01:34:11.787 --> 01:34:13.748
...to stop them.

01:34:34.908 --> 01:34:37.348
Couldn't let it rest, could you?

01:34:37.988 --> 01:34:39.548
You had to push it.

01:34:41.468 --> 01:34:43.149
Go to hell.

01:34:45.028 --> 01:34:46.468
Sir!

01:34:49.508 --> 01:34:53.748
So you don't feel responsible for
the rape and murder?

01:34:57.789 --> 01:34:59.989
No, sir. I don't.

01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:02.669
Is it your feeling, Corporal Clark...

01:35:02.869 --> 01:35:07.149
...that you are wrongly brought
to trial by the U.S. Government?

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:16.309
I don't have anything
against the government.

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:21.950
But I just think soldiers like
Tony Meserve and me...

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.509
...belong out in combat...

01:35:24.749 --> 01:35:26.590
...not here.

01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:32.750
Throw us in the stockade and you're
helping nobody but the Viet Cong.

01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:38.510
When Sergeant Meserve called you, did
you go willingly into the hootch...

01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:42.110
...and rape the girl...

01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:43.950
...Tran Thi Oahn?

01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:48.350
Please answer the question.

01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:54.950
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:35:57.830 --> 01:36:02.350
Have you any idea why Eriksson
stayed out of the hootch?

01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:08.910
Well, he was brand-new, sir.

01:36:09.551 --> 01:36:14.950
I was there a lot longer than him.
At least three weeks longer than him.

01:36:15.391 --> 01:36:16.831
You're saying, then...

01:36:17.031 --> 01:36:22.151
...you involved yourself in rape to
avoid being ridiculed?

01:36:25.671 --> 01:36:28.431
When you go out on a patrol, sir...

01:36:28.631 --> 01:36:31.551
...you're not gonna be
as good as you wanna be.

01:36:31.751 --> 01:36:34.631
These guys aren't helping you
do anything.

01:36:35.872 --> 01:36:40.711
There's gonna be four people
on that patrol, and an individual.

01:36:48.032 --> 01:36:52.152
And so I did what I did,
and I got remorse about it.

01:36:55.472 --> 01:36:58.992
But I also got remorse about
talking at this trial.

01:37:00.192 --> 01:37:03.712
I have a loyalty to the men
I was out there with.

01:37:03.912 --> 01:37:06.352
Is it standard for
U.S. personnel...

01:37:06.592 --> 01:37:09.792
...to have sex with
prisoners and kill them?

01:37:09.992 --> 01:37:12.352
-Objection!
-Overruled.

01:37:12.712 --> 01:37:16.392
The prisoner tried to give
away the squad's position.

01:37:17.672 --> 01:37:22.353
She was ill and coughing from the
abuse of you and your men.

01:37:22.592 --> 01:37:25.952
She shouldn't have been there
to jeopardize your position!

01:37:26.193 --> 01:37:28.552
You dragged her out
and raped her!

01:37:28.752 --> 01:37:32.712
And then you blame her for coughing,
so you kill her!

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:36.033
-Does that about sum it up?
-Objection.

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:41.273
Well, sir...

01:37:42.153 --> 01:37:44.513
...I've seen a lot of killing...

01:37:45.433 --> 01:37:49.953
...which it's our duty to do,
because it's kill or be killed.

01:37:51.273 --> 01:37:54.953
Sometimes you hate
the enemy so badly....

01:38:01.073 --> 01:38:03.194
About two ops back...

01:38:03.553 --> 01:38:05.473
...Operation Turner...

01:38:05.674 --> 01:38:08.834
...we saw a hootch
that had been burned down.

01:38:09.354 --> 01:38:13.553
Some Vietnamese were carrying kids
out of a bunker.

01:38:13.794 --> 01:38:16.754
They suffered from smoke inhalation.

01:38:17.994 --> 01:38:21.754
I gave one small child
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

01:38:23.794 --> 01:38:27.394
That just shows you
we ain't all combat over here.

01:38:31.274 --> 01:38:35.034
Of the charges of rape and
unpremeditated murder...

01:38:35.274 --> 01:38:37.554
...PFC Diaz is found guilty...

01:38:37.754 --> 01:38:41.034
...sentenced to eight years' hard labour.

01:38:42.754 --> 01:38:47.154
Of the charge of rape,
PFC Hatcher is found guilty...

01:38:47.355 --> 01:38:51.114
...and sentenced to
15 years' hard labour.

01:38:51.475 --> 01:38:54.554
Of the charges of
rape and premeditated murder...

01:38:54.755 --> 01:38:57.115
...Corporal Clark is found guilty...

01:38:57.355 --> 01:39:00.555
...sentenced to life imprisonment
at hard labour.

01:39:01.875 --> 01:39:04.395
Of the charge of
unpremeditated murder...

01:39:04.595 --> 01:39:08.475
...Sergeant E5 Meserve
is found guilty...

01:39:08.675 --> 01:39:11.555
...sentenced to 10 years' hard labour.

01:39:12.315 --> 01:39:14.515
Sentences will begin immediately...

01:39:14.755 --> 01:39:18.355
...at Disciplinary Barracks,
Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas.

01:39:18.555 --> 01:39:20.755
Prisoners dismissed.

01:39:27.796 --> 01:39:31.715
If these guys get convicted,
they won't do any real time.

01:39:32.436 --> 01:39:35.356
They'll be out of the stockade
before you know it.

01:39:35.555 --> 01:39:38.076
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off.

01:39:38.276 --> 01:39:40.636
I'd be looking for payback!

01:41:18.759 --> 01:41:21.958
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss!

01:41:22.798 --> 01:41:26.238
-You forgot this.
-Oh! Thank you. Bye.

01:41:33.918 --> 01:41:36.119
Do I remind you of someone?

01:41:39.559 --> 01:41:40.878
Yeah.

01:41:46.479 --> 01:41:49.159
You had a bad dream, didn't you?

01:41:49.679 --> 01:41:51.079
Yes.

01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:59.879
It's over now, I think.
