WEBVTT

00:19.270 --> 00:20.589
John".

00:23.310 --> 00:24.891
Stay with me, all right?

00:27.150 --> 00:30.062
Got your note. I got your note.

00:40.490 --> 00:41.536
Take him this way.

01:01.140 --> 01:02.175
Hey!

01:02.680 --> 01:03.840
She's right there.

01:04.310 --> 01:06.050
She's just one of 'em.
We're gonna get 'em all.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.600
I came here with him.

01:15.650 --> 01:16.856
I'm his friend.

01:17.780 --> 01:21.113
- Okay. I can get medical supplies.
- I got it.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.156
- I'll be back.
- I know you will.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.749
Guys. Behind the bus.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.345
Go, go, go.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.391
You told me we could take 'em!

01:49.480 --> 01:52.722
Yeah, I was wrong.
We've got to get out of here. Let's go!

02:16.300 --> 02:17.335
Cover me.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.215
Wait!

02:20.470 --> 02:22.210
Stop. I just need the field kit.

02:22.850 --> 02:24.215
No, we need to get outta here.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.345
Please!

02:26.600 --> 02:28.841
Jesus, Naomi. I thought you got it.

02:56.670 --> 02:57.716
We took you in.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.870
No... I wasn't. It's not what you think.

02:59.970 --> 03:02.677
We gave you a home. And you took it...

03:08.770 --> 03:11.648
There's nothing left here.
We have to get him someplace else.

03:11.730 --> 03:12.799
Get him where?

03:12.900 --> 03:14.720
I know a place, but we have to
get him out of here somehow.

03:35.590 --> 03:36.625
I'm sorry.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.546
We gotta leave!

03:56.440 --> 03:59.648
Al... John's hurt real bad.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.139
We need to get in there and get him out.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.616
Al. Hey.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.321
I'm not part of this story.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.859
Hey, no, no, no.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.781
You're not hiding behind that thing today.

04:11.870 --> 04:14.703
Because if you do,
a good man is gonna die.

04:16.210 --> 04:17.700
This story's almost finished.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.040
Doesn't have to be that way for John.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.715
Look at me.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.126
Let's get him inside.

05:05.090 --> 05:07.081
We gotta move. Now!

05:12.270 --> 05:15.728
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.220
I have to go make sure Mel's okay.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.475
Over there!

05:23.240 --> 05:24.855
Erm, he's gone.

05:25.610 --> 05:27.566
I'm real sorry,
but you need to come with me.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.446
It's the only way you don't die.

05:51.890 --> 05:53.096
All right, where we goin'?

05:54.680 --> 05:55.726
The stadium.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.680
They told us that place fell.

05:59.770 --> 06:02.318
It did. That's why we have to go there.

06:02.980 --> 06:04.311
You're supposed to be dead.

06:06.490 --> 06:08.026
Want to tell us what else they got wrong?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.021
All right.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.126
Hey.

07:01.670 --> 07:03.740
You know none of this is
gonna be ready for months?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.159
The rations'll get us through.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.341
Did you ever think
we weren't gonna make it?

07:17.720 --> 07:18.880
Plenty of times.

07:21.350 --> 07:22.647
So what got you through?

07:23.650 --> 07:26.107
Thinking about how bad
I didn't want to be back out there.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.568
It's better in here. We're better in here.

07:33.450 --> 07:34.485
Hey, Mad/son?

07:37.540 --> 07:38.689
What is it, Douglas?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.160
We got a Visitor.

07:50.090 --> 07:51.216
Why you here, Charlie?

07:53.430 --> 07:54.465
I need your help.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.607
He doesn't have much time.

08:08.110 --> 08:10.180
I'm in, Morgan. I'll get him there.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.446
Okay.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.440
You're Nick's friend.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.161
Yeah.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.586
You know what I did.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.461
Why did you save me?

08:35.340 --> 08:37.547
Because this has to stop someplace.

08:38.970 --> 08:40.050
You know?

08:42.140 --> 08:43.186
Yeah.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.954
Come on. Look at me.
Look at me. Stay with me.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.979
He's been looking for you.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.704
He has, all this time. He never gave up.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.290
You try to protect someone...

10:01.760 --> 10:03.136
you just wind up hurting them.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.646
What happened?

10:13.780 --> 10:17.318
Alicia, Luciana, Strand, Nick?

10:18.360 --> 10:19.736
What did you do to them?

10:25.580 --> 10:27.741
What happened back there wasn't her fault.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.625
It was mine.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.896
He is breathing. Barely.

11:00.070 --> 11:01.480
We've got to bring him back.

11:01.570 --> 11:03.902
I think he may have some
lung damage from the crash.

11:07.540 --> 11:08.905
So, Charlie, why'd you come to us?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.536
Why didn't you go to
someone else in your own group?

11:12.290 --> 11:13.951
Because Mel and Ennis had a fight.

11:15.130 --> 11:16.165
About what?

11:16.960 --> 11:18.040
I...

11:18.130 --> 11:20.963
I don't know, okay? They were ﬁghting
and Mel told me to get in the bus.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.545
He said we were leaving.

11:23.430 --> 11:25.671
When we were driving,
one of the dead stepped onto the road.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.170
He tried to go around it, but...

11:32.440 --> 11:35.011
If we leave him out here, will he make it?

11:35.110 --> 11:36.259
I don't know.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.681
If any of the dead show up,
he's not gonna be fighting them off.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.857
So, leaving him out here,
we're leaving him out here to die.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.367
Okay, so they lost.

11:45.530 --> 11:49.489
Ennis was mad.
And they know we have supplies now.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.701
You got us pretty good before, Charlie.

11:53.790 --> 11:56.748
I lied about that, and I'm sorry.
But I'm not lying now.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.335
Madison.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.960
Please.

12:07.850 --> 12:09.090
We'll bring him back with us.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.637
Whoa, whoa.
Mom, we just started replanting.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.641
We're finally in a good place again.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.267
- If this is some kind of trick...
- It's not.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.816
If it is, we'll handle it.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.642
But we don't know who they are, okay?

12:21.740 --> 12:25.949
We don't know what this is.
Mom, we can't just keep doing this.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.730
She pointed a gun at my head
when we first met.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.247
And now we're replanting our crops,
thanks to her.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.376
I'll help you get him in the truck.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.840
This one's got keys!

13:11.790 --> 13:14.361
He got hit in the gut.
She'll be looking for supplies.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.457
The Vultures raided every place
from here to the stadium.

13:23.090 --> 13:24.159
Except for one.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.846
Wait.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.411
How long was she with you?

14:03.960 --> 14:06.508
How. Long.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.010
You know what?

14:21.440 --> 14:22.566
It doesn't matter.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.915
What am I doing here?

14:42.420 --> 14:44.126
It's all right. You broke a couple ribs.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.291
You may have bruised your lungs.

14:46.670 --> 14:48.080
I can't be in here.

14:50.010 --> 14:52.296
Where's Charlie? Where's Charlie?

14:52.680 --> 14:54.216
Charlie asked us to help you.

14:57.850 --> 15:00.842
She's here? She safe?

15:01.610 --> 15:02.645
She's fine.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.349
You need to let us go.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.230
I can't be in here.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.521
You have a serious injury.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.826
It's not safe in here.

15:13.910 --> 15:15.821
You said that once before,
but we proved you wrong.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.036
My brother...

15:19.040 --> 15:21.452
He said if this place
wasn't gonna fall on its own,

15:21.540 --> 15:23.167
he was gonna make it fall.

15:27.090 --> 15:28.546
You know how many weapons we have.

15:28.630 --> 15:29.665
You know how many people are here.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.751
If your brother and
your crew want to try something,

15:31.840 --> 15:33.046
we can handle them.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.052
They're not the ones
you need to be worried about.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.157
The tanks were empty. The dead were gone.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.366
This is all that was left.

15:56.530 --> 15:57.736
Mel's telling the truth.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.325
You think Ennis is leading them all here?

16:04.170 --> 16:06.707
No, he wouldn't do that.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.540
Are you sure, Charlie?

16:16.140 --> 16:20.224
Gotta be ready, either way.
It's gonna be tough, but we can manage.

16:20.310 --> 16:23.552
Madison, the tanks where we met
our new acquaintance, Naomi,

16:23.650 --> 16:24.890
were not the only ones out there.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.686
They run the whole length of the railway.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.976
Those tanks have dead in them, too?

16:29.690 --> 16:30.770
Had.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.565
How many are we talking?

16:45.960 --> 16:49.544
- Oh, my God.
- Tell Douglas to double the watch.

16:50.340 --> 16:53.673
Check the weapons in the armoury.
No one goes in or out without us knowing.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.795
I'm on it.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.928
You take Charlie to your room.
Make sure she stays there.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.981
All right, just try to
take the deepest breaths you can.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.538
You take me to Charlie. Right now.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.201
Ah!

17:29.130 --> 17:30.950
Don't make me break those cracked ribs.

17:47.730 --> 17:50.437
Your name is... Naomi, right?

17:50.610 --> 17:53.226
I'm here to keep you breathing, that's it.

17:54.780 --> 17:56.065
These people, they...

17:58.740 --> 18:01.573
I keep warning them,
but they won't listen to me.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.326
But Charlie...

18:08.000 --> 18:09.706
She said you're new to this place.

18:11.710 --> 18:13.371
Maybe you were out there for a while.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.626
Maybe you were at
another place that went down.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.176
Maybe you know what I know.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.841
The people who stay die.

18:27.390 --> 18:29.972
And everything they were fighting for
dies with them and...

18:31.610 --> 18:33.566
Doesn't need to be _
that way for you, Naomi.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.732
Whatever you think of this place,
it's not worth your life.

18:41.530 --> 18:43.191
You should come with us.

18:46.910 --> 18:50.619
You help us, we'll help you.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.836
'Cause I just got a feeling that...

18:58.050 --> 18:59.369
You know I'm right.

19:59.150 --> 20:00.196
Madison.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.611
Madison. Madison...

20:05.910 --> 20:07.866
Need the lumber to reinforce the walls.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.286
We'll build you another room
once this is all done.

20:10.370 --> 20:11.701
We're not safe here, Madison.

20:11.790 --> 20:14.122
- We will be.
- No, we won't.

20:16.750 --> 20:17.796
Mel?

20:21.470 --> 20:22.789
We should consider what he's saying.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.130
We should think about leaving.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.340
No, that's what they want.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.807
That's what they've wanted
since the minute they showed up.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.977
Whatever comes at us, we'll handle it.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.814
'Cause goin' back out there...
things don't get any better.

20:38.900 --> 20:39.969
Madison...

20:40.070 --> 20:41.947
No. I built this place for my kids.

20:42.990 --> 20:45.982
So Nick and Alicia could
have something close to a real life.

20:47.490 --> 20:50.288
You want to protect them,
you're going to have to disappoint them.

20:56.330 --> 20:57.991
I thought about us walking away.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.336
After we came back with the seeds,

21:02.670 --> 21:04.331
I asked Alicia to prep a car.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.459
"Just in case."

21:09.060 --> 21:10.459
But I saw it on her face.

21:14.060 --> 21:16.346
Like I was chipping away at everything
we'd built here.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.310
I told myself I wouldn't use it.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.651
I think you should reconsider.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.706
What'd he say to you?

21:34.870 --> 21:36.167
He didn't have to say anything.

21:39.540 --> 21:43.124
Madison, I've been on the wrong side
of where you are right now.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.508
And I really don't want to see
that happen to you.

21:45.590 --> 21:48.718
This place...
I know you built it for your kids.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.136
But it's not worth risking their lives.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.135
Or yours.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.695
You want to go?

22:53.620 --> 22:56.441
Go. Why are you really here, huh?

22:56.540 --> 22:59.703
Turn everyone against us?
Bring this place down from the inside?

22:59.790 --> 23:01.451
Where's Charlie?

23:01.540 --> 23:03.667
She's not going with you, Mel.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.411
I helped you.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.626
I told you about my brother.
Where's Charlie?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.369
Which is why
we're gonna protect this place.

23:09.470 --> 23:11.711
But I can't let you risk Charlie's life
by taking her out there.

23:23.690 --> 23:24.725
Open up the gate.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.856
Madison, what are you doing?

23:27.940 --> 23:29.191
Get the Land Rover.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.695
Mom?

23:31.780 --> 23:33.611
There's food in there. There's supplies.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.577
But he's hurt. He might die out there.

23:35.660 --> 23:36.820
He wants to go.

23:36.910 --> 23:38.616
It's not up to us to show him the way.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.497
We don't have time to. Open the gate.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.629
Madison, I'm standing here
because you didn't give up on me.

23:44.460 --> 23:45.745
What makes him any different?

23:46.420 --> 23:47.751
Open the gate or I will.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.386
Gate.

23:56.220 --> 23:57.300
Let's go.

24:00.810 --> 24:01.970
Let me take her. Please.

24:02.060 --> 24:03.095
- No.
- But...

24:03.190 --> 24:05.397
The two of you, moving place to place,
you won't make it.

24:05.860 --> 24:08.727
Even if you do, whoever Charlie turns into
won't be Charlie any more.

24:08.820 --> 24:11.448
Madison, please.
The goddamn walls aren't gonna hold!

24:11.530 --> 24:13.521
Yes, they will. And we'll keep her safe.

24:13.610 --> 24:15.521
Oh, "We will keep her safe"? Really?

24:16.740 --> 24:18.446
That's the same thing
Charlie's parents said to me.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.939
And you know what? They died.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.861
Right in front of her.
Don't make her go through that again.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.666
That wasn't here. That wasn't us.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.383
You're holding onto something that's gone!

24:37.560 --> 24:40.347
You're trying to be the
type of people that are extinct!

24:47.110 --> 24:48.816
No one's gone til! they're gone.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.829
Seal that up.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.056
And don't think about what he said.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.229
Think you should've
made him stay.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.900
He was gonna get out anyway.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.319
He might've taken Charlie with him.

25:45.410 --> 25:48.959
Wouldn't have gotten far.
He's not gonna get far now.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.792
I'm trying to protect you and your sister.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.920
- Hey, Mom.
- What?

25:58.970 --> 26:00.961
You remember when I said that

26:01.060 --> 26:03.301
I was afraid of who I was out there?

26:05.730 --> 26:08.802
I think I was really afraid
of being away from you.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.441
Because you show me the way.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.401
And you always find me when I get lost.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.537
And I felt found here.

26:25.910 --> 26:27.116
I felt like...

26:28.460 --> 26:30.166
I was finally starting to get it.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.965
So, having a guy kill himself
because we're afraid of him...

26:36.510 --> 26:38.671
I don't think that's the way
you wanted us to wind up.

26:51.770 --> 26:55.024
He's gone? But he's hurt.

26:59.610 --> 27:03.159
He's not gonna make it.
And he's my friend.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.747
I put a walkie in the car. It's on.

27:11.830 --> 27:12.876
Please.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.508
Please let me just see if he's okay.

27:22.970 --> 27:24.005
Mel?

27:25.180 --> 27:26.386
Mel, can you near me?

27:30.060 --> 27:31.095
Charlie?

27:33.650 --> 27:36.562
Mel, where are you? Are you okay?

27:41.530 --> 27:42.565
Mel?

27:44.080 --> 27:45.115
Mel!

27:50.000 --> 27:51.035
Mel?

28:00.090 --> 28:02.888
Please. Please, you have to help him.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.260
Let's get a couple more over there.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.971
I'm hopin' all this keeps out
whatever's comin' our way.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.640
Cole?

28:18.690 --> 28:20.271
We're gonna need you to take it down.

28:20.650 --> 28:21.730
We have to get out.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.310
Does Madison know you're leaving?

28:26.990 --> 28:28.036
What do you think?

28:28.580 --> 28:29.820
You gonna let us out or not?

28:33.580 --> 28:35.286
You're going after him, aren't you?

28:41.380 --> 28:42.961
Your mother did the same thing for me.

28:43.840 --> 28:47.003
Far be it from me to stop you.
Come on. Let's take it down.

29:08.740 --> 29:09.786
Keep up the chatter.

29:09.870 --> 29:11.940
Mad/son never checks
higher than channel 6.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.626
Sure this is the right thing?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.125
I'm sure.

29:24.550 --> 29:28.134
She'll come around. We'll find Mel.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.097
She'll remember why she built this place.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.270
Ready?

29:52.200 --> 29:53.280
You know what to do.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.576
You here to tell me you're going?

30:37.370 --> 30:38.416
No.

30:40.580 --> 30:42.628
In that case, sorry about your bedroom.

30:45.050 --> 30:46.256
I can sleep anywhere.

30:47.590 --> 30:50.548
But if you try to remove the showers,
I will chain myself to the pipes.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.221
I forgot what it felt like for my kids
to look at me like that.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.487
_ Wouldn't it be worse
If they didn't look at you lIke that?

31:13.450 --> 31:15.190
Guess I taught 'em something after all.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.996
Whatever's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen soon.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.170
I'm prepping the infirmary.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.902
Over there.
The Land Rover. There.

32:01.330 --> 32:02.365
We found him.

32:02.460 --> 32:03.950
Then get back here
with due haste.

32:18.850 --> 32:19.885
Is he okay?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.847
Tell Naomi we're bringing him back.
He's in rough shape.

32:23.940 --> 32:25.009
Alicia.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.486
It's all right. It's all right.

32:31.570 --> 32:33.106
We're just gonna
take you back to the stadium.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.940
Wait, Alicia.

32:36.030 --> 32:37.941
Please. No, no, no, no.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.325
Headlights. Headlights. Headlights.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.150
Okay. It's Ennis.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.456
Strand, you have a convoy coming your way.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.371
Take the county road.
We can beat 'em back there.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.961
Get Madison. Sound the alarm.

33:49.020 --> 33:51.102
You knew they went out there
and you didn't try to stop 'em?

33:51.400 --> 33:53.641
They needed to do it, Madison.
They needed to save him.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.276
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.818
There. That ain't a convoy.

34:11.130 --> 34:12.370
Nick? Alicia? Is that you?

34:13.670 --> 34:15.080
We ’re st/Y/ half a m/7e oﬁf

35:07.640 --> 35:08.846
Who the hell is that?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.429
We don't know. Just get in here.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.776
What if they want you
to open the gate?

35:16.150 --> 35:17.310
What if it's a trap?

36:09.580 --> 36:10.865
We gotta get 'em inside now.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.165
What's happening?

36:16.090 --> 36:17.660
They're out there. Nick and Alicia.

36:19.130 --> 36:20.620
Take her. I'll be back.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.201
We ’re gonna open the gate.
Get inside.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.516
They're covered in oil. They get close...

37:59.900 --> 38:02.312
I know. Get the irrigation truck!

38:09.660 --> 38:12.197
Madison, you can't go out there.

38:12.910 --> 38:15.287
My kids are in that parking lot.
You gonna stop me?

38:15.370 --> 38:18.203
No. I'm coming with you.

38:21.170 --> 38:22.205
So am I.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.712
- How much ammo do you have?
- Not enough.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.591
We ’re not gonna
last much longer out here.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.851
There’s too many.
We can’t drive through them.

38:45.190 --> 38:46.316
Open the gate. We're going out there.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.526
Now wait!

38:47.610 --> 38:50.272
We gotta get that fire out
before anybody goes aanhere.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.533
Not a discussion, Douglas.
Shut up and open the gate.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.325
I got this.

39:02.710 --> 39:04.120
Mom, I ’m sorry.

39:06.130 --> 39:07.370
We had to come out here.

39:10.220 --> 39:11.630
We had to try and save him.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.460
We cou/dn ’t just. . . Hide.

39:17.930 --> 39:19.682
We didn’t mean to do this to you.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.140
But it was the r/ght thing to do.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.227
No. Don't stop. We don't have time.

40:03.190 --> 40:05.067
You're sure this place has what you need?

40:05.150 --> 40:06.640
I set up the infirmary myself.

40:06.730 --> 40:08.061
What makes you think it's still there?

40:08.150 --> 40:10.527
Ennis and the rest, they took
what they could from the outside

40:10.610 --> 40:11.941
but even they wouldn't go in there.

40:14.780 --> 40:15.826
But we are?

40:16.280 --> 40:17.326
Please...

40:22.670 --> 40:23.739
Hey, Al.

40:25.670 --> 40:27.297
I think I know who you are.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.462
- I think I've seen it.
- Yeah, you definitely don't know who I am.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.676
'Cause I am a chick with layers.

41:05.750 --> 41:06.830
Hold on.
