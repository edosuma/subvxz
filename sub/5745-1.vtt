00:50.492 --> 00:52.426
<i>On the day the world ended...</i>

00:52.494 --> 00:57.830
<i>the fate of mankind was carried</i>
<i>in a small metal box.</i>

01:07.309 --> 01:11.905
<i>In a secret location, architects,</i>
<i>scientists and engineers met...</i>

01:11.980 --> 01:15.438
<i>and concluded that there was</i>
<i>only one hope for our future:</i>

01:17.085 --> 01:19.883
<i>To build an underground city...</i>

01:19.955 --> 01:23.686
<i>designed to keep its citizens
protected for generations to come.</i>

01:35.504 --> 01:38.007
Secure the box.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.007
Set it for
200 years.

01:40.108 --> 01:43.441
We'll keep them in the city for 200 years.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.080
You're certain
that'll be long enough?

01:47.149 --> 01:51.051
None of us can be certain of anything.
We can hope.

01:51.119 --> 01:55.112
<i>Growing up with no knowledge</i>
<i>of a world outside...</i>

01:55.190 --> 01:59.854
future generations will be spared sorrow
for what they've lost.

02:05.033 --> 02:09.901
For the good of all mankind.

02:13.208 --> 02:16.143
<i>The box was entrusted to the first mayor...</i>

02:16.211 --> 02:18.475
<i>who was to pass it on</i>
<i>to her successor.</i>

02:26.087 --> 02:28.021
<i>As the years counted down...</i>

02:28.089 --> 02:31.490
<i>the box passed from mayor to mayor.</i>

02:31.560 --> 02:33.755
<i>None knew what secrets it held...</i>

02:33.829 --> 02:37.060
<i>only that it would open</i>
<i>when it was needed most.</i>

02:40.101 --> 02:42.934
<i>But fate ran another course...</i>

02:44.005 --> 02:46.599
<i>and the chain was broken.</i>

02:55.584 --> 02:59.315
<i>The box was tucked away</i>
<i>and forgotten...</i>

02:59.387 --> 03:02.379
<i>- and as the city grew old and began to crumble...</i>

03:02.457 --> 03:07.087
<i>the box quietly clicked open.</i>

03:54.743 --> 03:58.611
- Dad, do you hear that?
- Uh, hurry up. You don't wanna be late.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.672
- I am hurrying.
<i>- I'm proud of you, Son.</i>

04:01.750 --> 04:04.082
- Today's a big day.
- Yeah.

04:04.152 --> 04:07.918
I just hope I don't get assigned
some useless job.

04:07.989 --> 04:11.049
<i>You can't control what job you get on</i>
<i>Assignment Day. That's not the point.</i>

04:11.126 --> 04:14.721
The important thing is to do-

04:14.796 --> 04:17.230
your part.

04:17.298 --> 04:22.931
One, two, three, four...

04:23.004 --> 04:27.998
five, six, seven, eight-

04:32.814 --> 04:34.748
They're getting longer.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.808
- That one was.
<i>- Yeah, and it's the third one this week.</i>

04:37.886 --> 04:39.945
The Generator's
our only source of power.

04:40.021 --> 04:42.046
<i>- All Electricians and Wiremen-</i>
- If it goes-

04:42.123 --> 04:44.148
<i>- are advised to report to their stations.</i>
- we all go.

04:44.225 --> 04:47.956
- That's dramatic.
- Dad, this place is falling apart.

04:48.029 --> 04:52.261
No, I will not just sit around
while Ember collapses.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.098
I'm getting into that Generator,
whatever it takes.

05:24.399 --> 05:26.959
Congratulations...

05:27.035 --> 05:30.869
on achieving
this momentous occasion:

05:30.939 --> 05:34.102
your Assignment Day.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.938
I'm late!

05:40.015 --> 05:42.506
- Lina, are you and your granny all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

05:42.584 --> 05:45.246
- You all right, Mr. Tock?
- Just another blackout, Lina.

05:46.521 --> 05:48.318
Hi.

05:57.198 --> 05:58.995
<i>Be you eight or 18, the time has come...</i>

05:59.067 --> 06:01.365
<i>- to answer the call to service.</i>
- Hi, Mr. Boaz.

06:01.436 --> 06:04.462
- Stop!
- Produce the Book Of The City Of Ember.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.639
- You need to sign in!
- I'm late!

06:25.126 --> 06:27.060
Psst! Lizzie.

06:29.898 --> 06:33.766
<i>- We swear-</i>
- Eternal loyalty to our city.

06:33.835 --> 06:37.100
We declare our infinite gratitude
to the Builders...

06:37.172 --> 06:39.106
who chose this site
with the greatest care.

06:39.174 --> 06:42.109
We flourish above
our mighty flowing river.

06:42.177 --> 06:46.443
We thrive thanks to the unbounded
capacity of our mighty Generator...

06:46.514 --> 06:49.449
beating at our very center
like a magnificent heart.

06:49.517 --> 06:54.079
Beyond Ember, the darkness
goes on forever in all directions.

06:54.155 --> 06:57.124
Ours is the only light in a dark world.

06:58.860 --> 07:00.851
It's true.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.738
Bag.

07:24.119 --> 07:26.952
Be the first to discover your future.

07:29.224 --> 07:31.385
Reach in, young man.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.488
Read it aloud.

07:37.565 --> 07:40.466
Electrician's Helper.

07:41.536 --> 07:43.663
I get to work in the Generator.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.801
<i>Timekeeper's Assistant.</i>

07:47.876 --> 07:49.810
<i>You get to work with clocks.</i>

07:53.414 --> 07:56.850
- Building Repair Assistant.
<i>- They have a lot of fun.</i>

07:59.053 --> 08:01.385
- Greenhouse Helper.
<i>- That-a girl.</i>

08:02.857 --> 08:06.088
- Potato Peeler.
<i>- You're gonna come in handy.</i>

08:12.934 --> 08:15.562
- Warehouse Clerk.
- A vital job.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.868
Pick one, young lady.

08:36.457 --> 08:38.618
Pipeworks?

08:38.693 --> 08:41.787
Louder, so we can all hear.

08:43.597 --> 08:45.623
I'm a Pipeworks Laborer.

08:45.700 --> 08:49.158
You're a very fortunate girl.
That is an important job.

08:58.446 --> 09:02.439
- Mold Scraper.
- We got a Mold Scraper. Great.

09:12.393 --> 09:16.022
Messenger.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.166
<i>- I picked a dull job, but compared to yours-</i>
- Lina.

09:24.239 --> 09:25.866
<i>- mine's a shining light bulb.</i>
<i>- Lina.</i>

09:25.940 --> 09:27.840
- Scream if you need me.
- Trade with me.

09:27.909 --> 09:30.707
- What?
- Swap jobs. Please. You have to.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.246
You want to work in the Pipeworks?

09:33.314 --> 09:37.011
I want to be Electrician's Helper and work
in the Generator, but Joss won't swap.

09:37.085 --> 09:38.950
I would rather die
than be a Messenger.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.386
- I don't want to waste my time while the whole city crumble-
- Yes.

09:41.456 --> 09:45.119
- What?
- Yes.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.025
- Thank you, Doon!
- Thanks!

10:01.442 --> 10:04.605
<i>#The light from the lamp is not all #</i>

10:04.679 --> 10:08.615
- #There is a brighter light ##
- Mrs. Murdo!

10:08.683 --> 10:11.743
- How was your Assignment Day?
- I'm a Messenger!

10:11.819 --> 10:15.482
That's wonderful, Lina!
Congratulations!

10:17.225 --> 10:19.056
Granny!

10:20.028 --> 10:22.428
Granny! Where are you?

10:23.498 --> 10:26.399
I'm a Messenger.

10:26.467 --> 10:30.426
You shouldn't make things up.
You-You're not a Messenger, Lina.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.564
But today was Assignment Day,
remember?

10:32.640 --> 10:35.632
Oh.

10:35.710 --> 10:38.804
- Where's Poppy?
- Poppy?

10:38.880 --> 10:43.476
- Poppy?
- She was helping me look for something.

10:43.551 --> 10:45.746
I- Here's Poppy.

10:49.390 --> 10:51.324
Poppy.

10:52.327 --> 10:54.761
<i>Poppy.</i>

10:54.829 --> 10:57.855
Poppy, take that out of your mouth.

10:59.334 --> 11:01.859
Here.

11:01.936 --> 11:04.427
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

11:13.915 --> 11:16.941
- I made it.
- Yeah, I can tell.

11:19.020 --> 11:23.013
- Uh, what's it for?
- It's for your graduation.

11:23.091 --> 11:26.788
I mean, what does it do?

11:26.861 --> 11:28.829
You'll figure it out.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.666
There's more to a bottle cap than
keeping liquid from leaking out of glass.

11:36.738 --> 11:41.402
The main thing is, pay attention.

11:41.476 --> 11:45.071
Pay close attention to everything-
everything you see.

11:45.146 --> 11:47.876
<i>Notice what no one else notices...</i>

11:47.949 --> 11:50.975
and you'll know
what no one else knows.

11:51.052 --> 11:54.818
<i>What you get is what you get.</i>

11:56.657 --> 11:58.420
What you do with what you get-

11:58.493 --> 12:01.257
<i>That's more the point.</i>

12:01.329 --> 12:04.230
Wouldn't you say?

12:04.298 --> 12:06.664
Really useful, Dad.

12:09.570 --> 12:11.834
Don't you want to eat?

12:11.906 --> 12:14.170
I'm not hungry.

12:16.144 --> 12:19.045
<i>I mean, we'll have to replace those.</i>

12:33.327 --> 12:35.454
Hey.

12:37.598 --> 12:39.463
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, it's okay.

12:39.534 --> 12:41.468
You hurt your wing.

12:44.405 --> 12:46.430
Hmm.

12:55.616 --> 12:58.779
- Good night, Lina.
- Good night, Poppy.

13:00.221 --> 13:03.315
I'll play you the voices
while you fall asleep, okay?

13:11.199 --> 13:14.430
Yoo-hoo.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.470
<i>Yoo-hoo.</i>

13:18.406 --> 13:20.966
Anybody home?

13:21.042 --> 13:23.272
<i>Don't hold dinner for me, darling.</i>

13:23.344 --> 13:26.108
<i>I'll be there before lights out.</i>

13:26.180 --> 13:29.911
<i>Mrs. Mayfleet, your shoes are ready.</i>

13:29.984 --> 13:34.580
Hi, Raine. It's Clary.

13:34.655 --> 13:38.523
The sprinkler system's down
again in number two.

13:38.593 --> 13:42.996
Raine, it's me, Barrow.

13:43.064 --> 13:45.294
I've been thinking about it.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.527
I watch my boy and...

13:48.603 --> 13:52.004
<i>I've come around.</i>
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

13:52.073 --> 13:54.098
<i>I'm in.</i>

13:56.677 --> 13:58.474
<i>Where do you go?</i>

14:47.995 --> 14:49.929
Lina Mayfleet, reporting for duty!

14:53.668 --> 14:56.228
You're early, Mayfleet.

14:57.238 --> 14:59.229
At ease. At ease.

15:23.931 --> 15:25.899
8:00!

15:25.967 --> 15:28.868
Stations, everybody!

15:45.019 --> 15:47.886
- It's beautiful.
- Wear it proudly.

15:47.955 --> 15:51.721
Take care of it.
Always keep it in good repair.

15:51.792 --> 15:53.783
I will.

15:55.363 --> 15:57.490
Your station is Garn Square.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.261
Stop!

16:00.334 --> 16:04.065
I need to tell you the rules.

16:04.138 --> 16:06.129
One: When a customer-

16:06.207 --> 16:08.607
Gives you a message, repeat it back
to make sure you've got it right.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.577
Two: Always wear the red cape
so people can identify you.

16:11.646 --> 16:14.171
<i>Three: Our customers pay</i>
<i>20 coins for every message...</i>

16:14.248 --> 16:17.046
no matter how far we have
to carry it, so go fast.

16:17.118 --> 16:19.086
I love going fast.

16:19.153 --> 16:21.678
Very good. I'm impressed.

16:21.756 --> 16:23.690
Now go!

16:28.362 --> 16:31.490
Sit. Sit.

16:31.565 --> 16:35.501
These overalls will go
over your clothes.

16:35.569 --> 16:38.538
That belt will have
all the tools you'll need.

16:38.606 --> 16:41.473
And I think there's enough traction
left in these boots.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.171
You need traction to work the pipes.

16:45.246 --> 16:47.441
- Thank you.
<i>- Now, this locker is yours.</i>

16:47.515 --> 16:51.007
You can put in your shoes
and whatnots.

16:51.085 --> 16:53.519
- All right?
- Okay.

16:53.587 --> 16:56.613
All right. Try this.

16:59.193 --> 17:01.957
You've got a big head.

17:02.963 --> 17:04.828
Try this one.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.833
Oh, that fits.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.496
All right, now.
Cut your name in there.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.732
- Why?
- Why?

17:12.807 --> 17:15.469
In case something happens to ya.

17:15.542 --> 17:19.479
The guy who wore this helmet
before you drowned.

17:19.547 --> 17:23.574
If he hadn't cut his name in there,
we wouldn't have known who he was.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.676
Here. Use this.

17:33.060 --> 17:35.995
I think I can figure out what's wrong
with the Generator.

17:37.064 --> 17:39.931
When can I see it? Hmm?

17:41.001 --> 17:44.630
Done.

17:44.705 --> 17:47.037
Sul?

17:59.019 --> 18:01.419
Twenty coins, please.

18:11.332 --> 18:13.596
Hey, slow down.

18:20.608 --> 18:22.405
Clary!

18:24.311 --> 18:26.609
<i>Clary! It's me.</i>

18:26.680 --> 18:28.875
Look at you.

18:28.949 --> 18:31.042
<i>- Roner told me.</i>
- You're my first message.

18:31.118 --> 18:33.245
That's great. I'm ready.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.220
From Arbin Swinn,
the vegetable vendor.

18:35.289 --> 18:37.450
Let me have it.

18:40.194 --> 18:43.994
"If this is a potato,
then I'm 16 and sexy."

18:49.370 --> 18:51.304
<i>Help!</i>

19:09.023 --> 19:10.957
<i>Stay back.</i>

19:11.025 --> 19:13.516
<i>He could be contaminated.</i>
<i>He's been in the Unknown Region.</i>

19:13.594 --> 19:15.528
<i>Don't go near 'im.</i>

19:15.596 --> 19:19.464
I couldn't see it, but I ran right into it.
I swear. It was as big as a house.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.798
I was just trying to get out
along the river.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.839
It was so dark.
I grabbed onto it.

19:25.906 --> 19:28.374
- I had to, before it grabbed me!
<i>- Don't touch him!</i>

19:28.442 --> 19:32.469
Stand back! Back!

19:32.546 --> 19:34.946
I had to! No! Ow!

19:35.015 --> 19:39.850
I knew it was dark,
but I had no idea how dark.

19:39.920 --> 19:43.287
I couldn't see anything.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.990
Why would he risk being thrown in jail-

19:48.062 --> 19:51.327
when everyone knows
it's against the law to go out there?

19:51.398 --> 19:53.963
<i> Come on, move!</i>

19:53.964 --> 19:56.529
There's far too much to do
here to worry about out there.

19:58.606 --> 20:02.042
Your father would have known
how to fix these potatoes.

20:05.145 --> 20:07.511
Don't dig too deep, Lina.

20:21.428 --> 20:25.387
<i>- The whole thing is rusted.</i>
- Yep.

20:25.466 --> 20:27.491
- You know, it ought to be replaced, Sul.
- Yep.

20:27.568 --> 20:31.766
- So where do you store new pipe?
- New pipe?

20:32.840 --> 20:35.570
We haven't had new pipe...

20:35.643 --> 20:38.077
since my second decade here.

20:38.145 --> 20:40.079
Yeah.

20:40.147 --> 20:42.741
We've been patchin' so long,
we have more patches than pipe.

20:42.816 --> 20:44.750
Here, hold that.

20:44.818 --> 20:46.911
Attaboy. That's good.

20:46.987 --> 20:50.218
Round and round we go. There.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.225
All right, we'll check it.

20:53.327 --> 20:55.693
Squeeze it.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.234
Is it holdin'?

21:01.302 --> 21:03.770
Uh, so far.

21:03.837 --> 21:08.297
So far? So far is so good.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.309
Oh.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.838
- W-What's gonna happen?
- Same as always.

21:14.915 --> 21:16.712
- What's that?
- We'll cope.

21:16.784 --> 21:18.581
But what about the blackouts?
They're getting worse.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.552
- They're-They're-They're-
- Slow down, kid.

21:20.621 --> 21:23.249
You have to learn
to take things as they come.

21:28.362 --> 21:31.490
Well, what's th-
What's this tunnel called?

21:31.565 --> 21:35.023
It's Tunnel 25. And this is 26.

21:35.102 --> 21:37.195
How do you know?

21:41.775 --> 21:43.834
Come on.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.447
<i>- What's that for?</i>
<i>- Pressure.</i>

21:49.516 --> 21:51.984
Waterwheel.

21:52.052 --> 21:54.043
And this?

21:54.121 --> 21:56.817
Don't know. It's not my job.

21:56.890 --> 22:00.417
But you've worked here forever.
How could you not know?

22:00.494 --> 22:03.019
Mindin' my own business keeps me-

22:03.097 --> 22:05.531
keeps me busy enough.

22:05.599 --> 22:09.865
Uh, can we go into the Generator?

22:52.146 --> 22:55.638
There's gotta be another way
into the Generator.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.221
Huh. This tunnel's been erased.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.990
Hey! What are you doing here?

25:19.059 --> 25:22.119
- You don't work in the storeroom.
- You're-You're Looper.

25:22.196 --> 25:25.632
- Uh, your brother was in my class.
- Oh.

25:25.699 --> 25:28.793
Thanks for the enlightening information.
Is that why you're here?

25:28.869 --> 25:30.803
- No. I'm training in the Pipeworks.
- Huh?

25:30.871 --> 25:32.532
- I'm-I'm training in the Pipeworks. I saw this-
- Huh?

25:32.606 --> 25:35.074
This rope. I-I-I got lost. I'm sorry.

25:35.142 --> 25:38.202
- Yeah, well, get lost again!
- Oh!

25:38.278 --> 25:40.872
You okay?

25:40.948 --> 25:42.882
Huh.

26:14.147 --> 26:16.445
<i>I'm over here!</i>

26:24.658 --> 26:27.058
<i>Lights, come on.</i>

26:27.127 --> 26:29.960
<i>- Help me!</i>
- Please.

26:30.030 --> 26:32.260
Please come on.

26:32.332 --> 26:34.197
<i>Lina? Lina?</i>

26:34.268 --> 26:36.202
- Doon?
<i>- Lina, keep talking.</i>

26:36.270 --> 26:38.204
Doon, where are you?

26:38.272 --> 26:40.638
Where are you? Hey, you okay?

26:40.707 --> 26:42.641
- Yeah.
- Keep talking. Are you okay?

26:42.709 --> 26:44.734
Yeah, I'm okay.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.905
Something's not right.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.007
They never last this long.

26:52.686 --> 26:55.951
- What's that sound?
- It's the Generator.

26:56.023 --> 26:58.753
<i>- But they can fix it, right?</i>
<i>- Maybe for now.</i>

26:58.825 --> 27:01.623
But we're-
We're running out of time.

27:01.695 --> 27:04.289
We have to do something.

27:04.364 --> 27:06.457
<i>There was a man this morning.</i>

27:06.533 --> 27:09.832
He came back from the Unknown Regions.
He said he heard water.

27:09.903 --> 27:12.599
Did you ever think
there might be a way out?

27:13.907 --> 27:15.841
A way out of Ember?

27:18.679 --> 27:21.512
<i>All Pipeworkers.</i>

27:21.581 --> 27:23.640
<i>All Pipeworkers,</i>
<i>Electricians and Engineers-</i>

27:23.717 --> 27:25.947
- Look, I need to get down the Pipeworks.
<i>- report immediately.</i>

27:26.019 --> 27:28.249
- You stay safe, Lina, okay?
- Doon.

27:28.322 --> 27:30.586
<i>- Attention, all Pipeworkers.</i>
- Doon!

27:30.657 --> 27:33.182
- Wait!
<i>- All Pipeworkers, Electricians, Engineers, report immediately.</i>

27:33.260 --> 27:35.194
Where'd you get that?

27:35.262 --> 27:38.959
- I-I think it came from some kind of animal.
- No, where did you get it?

27:39.032 --> 27:41.432
A man came back with it
from the Unknown Regions.

27:41.501 --> 27:43.492
It's from a beetle.

27:43.570 --> 27:45.663
<i>- Messenger!</i>
- It's beautiful.

27:45.739 --> 27:48.299
- Can I keep it?
<i>- I have a message.</i>

27:48.375 --> 27:51.674
Miss Sample, I need to get home
and check on my granny first.

27:51.745 --> 27:54.942
Pass the message as you go.
Tell everybody.

28:01.188 --> 28:03.281
Seven minutes!

28:03.357 --> 28:06.292
The power failure lasted seven minutes!

28:06.360 --> 28:08.260
Twice as long as we've ever had!

28:08.328 --> 28:10.262
# It was so strong #

28:10.330 --> 28:14.699
# But we live by the joy of our song #

28:14.768 --> 28:16.861
#The city shines-##

28:18.772 --> 28:20.763
Granny!

28:55.509 --> 28:57.500
No time! You better move!

28:58.645 --> 29:01.205
It's out of control!

29:01.281 --> 29:03.715
- It's here somewhere.
- What's here?

29:03.784 --> 29:08.949
Somewhere. Something.
It's very, very important.

29:09.022 --> 29:11.786
My great granddaddy-
He told me this.

29:11.858 --> 29:14.759
Wait here.

29:14.828 --> 29:18.423
Poppy, no. Give me that.

29:18.498 --> 29:20.432
Spit it out.

29:21.334 --> 29:23.598
Poppy, come on.

29:23.670 --> 29:26.605
Pop- Mmm! Fine.

29:26.673 --> 29:29.437
You're ruining the couch, Granny.

29:31.745 --> 29:35.272
You-You found it.

29:36.850 --> 29:39.318
- This is what you're looking for?
- Uh-huh.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.320
Are you sure?

29:43.690 --> 29:45.248
What's so special about it?

29:48.128 --> 29:51.620
I don't- I forget. I don't remember.

29:55.302 --> 29:58.135
I don't remember.

29:59.739 --> 30:01.673
Okay, Granny.
I've gotta get back to work.

30:01.741 --> 30:03.732
Okay.

30:04.811 --> 30:08.144
See ya, Pop.

30:18.091 --> 30:20.025
Joss?

30:20.093 --> 30:21.890
<i>- Joss.</i>
- Don't bother asking.

30:21.962 --> 30:24.123
The Generator's broken.
It's hopeless.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.427
<i>Next load!</i>

30:26.500 --> 30:29.628
<i>I have a message for Seely Schnap.</i>

30:29.703 --> 30:32.194
<i>I'm Seely Schnap. What is it?</i>

30:32.272 --> 30:34.763
- Munn Millders sent me.
- He did?

30:34.841 --> 30:37.435
He wants me to tell you that he
can't come over for lunch today.

30:37.511 --> 30:38.842
Oh.

30:38.912 --> 30:41.005
He said that your house
is too far away from his...

30:41.081 --> 30:43.049
and he's afraid of the blackouts.

30:52.359 --> 30:54.327
I have a message...

30:54.394 --> 30:56.726
for the mayor.

30:59.032 --> 31:00.932
"Your ship is in."

31:16.716 --> 31:19.583
Good day, Messenger.

31:19.653 --> 31:22.679
What brings you to the Gathering Hall?

31:23.757 --> 31:25.884
I have a message for the mayor.

31:25.959 --> 31:27.586
Very good.

31:30.964 --> 31:33.660
Right this way, if you please.

31:37.971 --> 31:41.099
These pictures
are of all the mayors of Ember.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.443
I'm related to him.

31:44.511 --> 31:47.173
He was my great-great-

31:47.247 --> 31:50.614
I don't know how many "greats"-
grandfather.

31:50.684 --> 31:54.552
"Podd Morethwart,
Seventh Mayor of Ember."

31:55.622 --> 31:58.113
We still live in the same place he did.

31:59.192 --> 32:01.183
Mmm.

32:15.008 --> 32:16.942
<i>Come in.</i>

32:26.486 --> 32:28.977
I recognize you
from Assignment Day, don't I?

32:29.055 --> 32:32.786
She's a direct descendant
of our seventh mayor.

32:32.859 --> 32:36.056
Are you? How nice. Name?

32:36.129 --> 32:39.997
- Lina Mayfleet.
- "Mayfleet"?

32:40.066 --> 32:44.503
<i>That is a name for a Messenger.</i>

32:47.140 --> 32:50.109
May your feet be fleet.

32:56.416 --> 32:59.146
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>you were born for the job.</i>

32:59.219 --> 33:01.244
What is your message for me,
Lina Mayfleet?

33:01.321 --> 33:03.687
It's from Looper, sir.

33:03.757 --> 33:06.282
Oh.

33:16.102 --> 33:18.332
"Your ship is in."

33:20.940 --> 33:22.874
Excellent.

33:28.415 --> 33:31.384
What are those boxes
in the portraits, sir?

33:31.451 --> 33:34.352
Is that part of the message?

33:34.421 --> 33:37.015
No, I was just curious.

33:37.090 --> 33:39.650
Thank you.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.591
<i>- Attention. Sewage spill in Apartment Block 14.</i>

33:47.667 --> 33:49.999
<i>Plumbers and Bucketmen, be advised.</i>

33:50.070 --> 33:54.029
I'm just looking after myself. You've heard
the rumors. You know what they're saying.

33:54.107 --> 33:56.803
- It's going black for good.
- What's going black for good?

33:56.876 --> 33:59.071
Clean your ears, Little Miss Nosy.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.079
I said "back."

34:01.147 --> 34:03.081
<i>Going back for good.</i>

34:05.452 --> 34:07.386
Did you deliver the message?

34:09.723 --> 34:11.815
Ember's been here a long time.

34:12.891 --> 34:15.087
Blackouts or no blackouts...

34:15.161 --> 34:17.094
the Generator hasn't failed us yet.

34:17.163 --> 34:19.324
The Generator won't last.

34:19.399 --> 34:21.367
It's falling apart.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.594
And no one knows
what they're doing down there.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.161
Something's really wrong.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.230
What can you do about it?

34:28.308 --> 34:30.242
Hmm?

34:31.578 --> 34:34.478
What can <i>you</i> do about it?

34:45.824 --> 34:48.885
How do you explain
that this used to be so small?

34:53.366 --> 34:55.800
You're gonna
give yourself a headache.

35:25.799 --> 35:27.664
"Ember."

35:29.536 --> 35:31.265
"Time."

35:34.040 --> 35:36.736
"Support life."

35:42.415 --> 35:44.440
"One: Proceed."

35:44.517 --> 35:47.247
"Two: R-Release."

36:09.409 --> 36:11.468
It's so shiny.

36:11.544 --> 36:15.173
What do you think it is?

36:15.248 --> 36:17.443
<i>I need 20 packages of light bulbs.</i>

36:17.517 --> 36:20.384
<i>My shop's outta peas.</i>
<i>I need 15 airtights.</i>

36:20.453 --> 36:23.354
Well, ya can't have 15.
You can only have three.

36:23.423 --> 36:26.688
<i>Don't give me that. Just yesterday I saw</i>
<i>plenty airtights in Pott Street Market.</i>

36:26.759 --> 36:29.159
Well, that's why there aren't
so many today, isn't it?

36:29.229 --> 36:32.289
- Don't be smart with me.
- What do you want me to do? Make peas out of thin air?

36:32.365 --> 36:34.629
- Next!
- I need help right now, please!

36:43.042 --> 36:46.239
- Did-Did we find it?
- Lie back, Roo.

36:46.312 --> 36:48.371
- Did we-
- You need to stay in bed today.

36:48.448 --> 36:51.076
We found it, Granny.

36:51.150 --> 36:53.084
Found it.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.513
Granny, what is it?

36:56.589 --> 36:58.523
Can you tell me?

36:58.591 --> 37:01.059
- Don't ask her to talk now.
<i>- Found it.</i>

37:01.127 --> 37:03.493
What's best for you is to sleep.

37:03.563 --> 37:07.522
<i>Isn't there any medicine you can give her?</i>

37:07.600 --> 37:09.932
I'm low on medicine. I'm sorry.

37:11.504 --> 37:14.405
Give her as much water
as she'll drink, eh?

37:16.342 --> 37:18.674
Can you look at Poppy too?

37:18.745 --> 37:20.679
Hang onto her.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.042
I'm just gonna look in your mouth.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.610
Don't bite.

37:29.689 --> 37:33.216
Well, what was that doing there?

37:46.506 --> 37:49.942
Poppy. Poppy, stop.

37:52.378 --> 37:55.711
Poppy, stand still. Don't move.

37:58.518 --> 38:01.180
Okay. Okay, I've got you.

38:05.191 --> 38:07.819
Granny, we're coming.

38:10.196 --> 38:12.130
<i>Granny?</i>

38:30.883 --> 38:34.842
<i> You and Poppy have to share,</i>
<i>but I think the bed's big enough.</i>

38:36.923 --> 38:40.381
<i>Poppy, let's make some dinner</i>
<i>and let your sister get settled.</i>

38:50.236 --> 38:53.171
Do you know your part?

38:55.675 --> 38:57.609
Um-

38:57.677 --> 39:00.703
I-I think I remember it pretty well
from last year.

39:00.780 --> 39:04.876
Oh, the Great Day of Singing
is so important.

39:04.951 --> 39:08.443
Oh, it lifts all of our hearts.
How lucky we are.

39:10.123 --> 39:12.990
I don't feel very lucky lately.

39:13.059 --> 39:17.189
- There's nothing to worry about.
- The blackouts worry everybody.

39:17.263 --> 39:19.993
Help is coming.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.000
- Help?
- Mm-hmm.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.195
Who built our city, dear?

39:24.270 --> 39:27.068
- The... Builders?
- That's right.

39:27.140 --> 39:30.803
And the Builders will come again
and show us the way.

39:41.988 --> 39:45.549
Whatever it is, Granny,
I'll figure it out.

39:47.226 --> 39:49.160
I promise.

40:06.846 --> 40:10.179
<i>- It says "Pipeworks. ''</i>
- That's why I brought it to you.

40:10.249 --> 40:12.615
This printing-

40:12.685 --> 40:15.176
You know what it reminds me of?

40:15.254 --> 40:17.586
Come on.
I gotta show you something.

40:23.362 --> 40:25.421
What are we doing here?

40:25.498 --> 40:28.433
The Builders left us this book.
We learned about it in History.

40:40.546 --> 40:42.537
Go on. Open it up.

40:44.283 --> 40:46.945
N-No one but the mayor's supposed to.

40:58.898 --> 41:00.957
The Builders wrote these instructions.

41:01.033 --> 41:03.263
It's exactly the same.

41:33.399 --> 41:35.367
Come on.

41:35.434 --> 41:37.834
There's something I have to show you.

41:39.405 --> 41:42.533
- Wow.
- What do you think?

41:42.608 --> 41:45.736
- I think it's instructions.
- Yeah?

41:45.812 --> 41:48.975
What I don't understand is,
why would they have it in a circle?

41:49.048 --> 41:51.039
- I mean, I know it must be important.
- Add a "T."

41:51.117 --> 41:53.051
- What?
- Add a "T."

41:53.119 --> 41:55.883
E-X-I-T. Exit.

41:55.955 --> 41:58.389
What if there's an exit from Ember?

42:05.598 --> 42:08.499
I don't think
we're supposed to be down here.

42:08.568 --> 42:11.765
<i>This tunnel was erased from Sul's map.</i>

42:11.838 --> 42:13.897
<i>It dead-ends in a locked room.</i>

42:16.876 --> 42:19.003
This could be it.

42:28.988 --> 42:32.185
<i>- That was just the last time.</i>
- Come on.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.226
<i>- The time before that I-</i>
<i>- Shh.</i>

42:35.461 --> 42:37.895
<i>You're gonna get us caught.</i>

42:37.964 --> 42:39.898
Come on.

42:55.681 --> 42:58.514
What was that?

42:59.652 --> 43:01.620
I have no idea.

43:45.298 --> 43:47.061
Run.

43:49.969 --> 43:51.834
Lina! Up here!

43:51.904 --> 43:55.738
<i>Go, go, go, go, go! Quickly, quickly!</i>

43:58.844 --> 44:00.971
Hurry! Get the box!

44:03.349 --> 44:05.943
Run!

44:48.027 --> 44:50.393
Hey!

44:50.463 --> 44:52.897
<i>Over here!</i>

45:01.640 --> 45:04.370
Lina! Lina! He's stuck! Jump!

45:14.420 --> 45:16.684
Thanks for another great idea.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.986
Moles need to eat all the time
just to stay alive.

45:19.058 --> 45:21.356
Probably just as hungry as we are.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.598
Did you see those storerooms?
They're completely empty.

45:30.669 --> 45:32.660
We're gonna run out of food.

45:36.342 --> 45:39.539
It doesn't matter anyway.
The Generator won't last.

45:39.612 --> 45:42.479
<i>And pretty soon</i>
<i>it'll be black for good.</i>

45:46.752 --> 45:51.018
"Mayfleet." That's my name.

45:51.090 --> 45:53.422
The man who wore that helmet
before me drowned.

45:56.796 --> 45:59.629
Drowned?

46:01.200 --> 46:03.225
He worked here.

46:03.302 --> 46:06.465
There's no water
but the irrigation pipes.

46:07.873 --> 46:09.864
How could he have drowned?

46:10.943 --> 46:13.503
<i>I miss him so much.</i>

46:15.681 --> 46:18.707
Mom too.

46:18.784 --> 46:21.981
How am I ever gonna figure out
what this is all about?

46:22.054 --> 46:24.284
It's all these zeros.

46:24.356 --> 46:26.790
That's what scares me the most.

46:27.860 --> 46:30.124
What would count down to nothing?

46:32.898 --> 46:35.423
- It sounds like doomsday.
- Oh, shh.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.594
Please, honey.

46:37.670 --> 46:40.696
Don't do anything foolish.

46:40.773 --> 46:42.764
I couldn't bear to lose you too.

46:42.842 --> 46:44.969
How did he die, Clary?

46:45.044 --> 46:46.978
Oh.

46:48.047 --> 46:49.981
Did he really drown?

47:03.929 --> 47:07.524
Your father thought
it was doomsday too.

47:07.600 --> 47:10.592
<i>He believed there was a way</i>
<i>to get out of Ember.</i>

47:10.669 --> 47:13.467
<i>I couldn't dissuade him.</i>

47:13.539 --> 47:17.908
<i>I said it was our duty to stay here</i>
<i>and fix our problems...</i>

47:17.977 --> 47:20.605
that it's illegal to venture out
into the Unknown.

47:20.679 --> 47:22.374
Why is it illegal?

47:28.154 --> 47:32.352
Your father said,
"The river runs in one direction...

47:32.424 --> 47:37.521
<i>so it must come from someplace</i>
<i>and go to someplace. ''</i>

47:37.596 --> 47:42.124
<i>But he must've hit it too early or something.</i>
<i>I- I don't know.</i>

47:42.201 --> 47:45.568
<i>The tunnel flooded, and-</i>

47:45.638 --> 47:49.335
<i>And my dad died.</i>

47:53.112 --> 47:55.706
He was by himself?

47:55.781 --> 47:59.410
Everyone else got out
before it collapsed.

48:05.391 --> 48:09.691
I was- I was considering
taking the box to the mayor.

48:09.762 --> 48:12.162
<i>Yes! Do that.</i>

48:12.231 --> 48:14.597
Do that instead, please.

48:14.667 --> 48:17.329
Let him handle the situation.

48:22.441 --> 48:24.739
<i>These are trying and troubled times.</i>

48:24.810 --> 48:28.576
Our problems are grave.

48:30.416 --> 48:32.407
We need answers.

48:32.484 --> 48:34.748
<i>But beyond answers-</i>

48:34.820 --> 48:38.722
more important than answers-

48:38.791 --> 48:41.191
we need solutions.

48:41.260 --> 48:43.194
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

48:43.262 --> 48:46.629
And in order to find those solutions...

48:48.534 --> 48:53.369
I propose we launch
a thorough investigation.

48:53.439 --> 48:55.532
Yes. Yes.

48:55.608 --> 48:59.442
I hereby declare
the creation of a task force...

48:59.511 --> 49:01.502
to investigate the blackouts.

49:06.485 --> 49:09.249
<i>Do I have volunteers?</i>

49:13.025 --> 49:18.019
Today we, the people...

49:18.097 --> 49:20.793
stand united against the darkness.

49:32.878 --> 49:34.675
My turn!

49:34.747 --> 49:37.238
Lizzie.

49:37.316 --> 49:39.079
Lizzie!

49:43.022 --> 49:46.014
<i>Hands off! Give me that!</i>

49:46.091 --> 49:48.286
- Peaches!
- All right! Go away!

49:48.360 --> 49:51.022
<i>Back off!</i>

49:51.096 --> 49:53.530
What's "applesauce"?

49:53.599 --> 49:55.658
<i>Hey, give me some!</i>

49:56.935 --> 49:58.818
Pineapple?

49:58.819 --> 50:00.701
- Give me that!
- Come on!

50:00.773 --> 50:04.641
No one's had pineapple since my grandmother
was a little girl. Where'd you get this?

50:04.710 --> 50:06.769
Give me that!

50:06.845 --> 50:09.313
Lizzie! Where'd you get that food?

50:11.517 --> 50:13.485
All right.

50:14.586 --> 50:17.384
I got it from my boyfriend.

50:17.456 --> 50:19.185
You don't have a boyfriend.

50:19.258 --> 50:22.455
It's not official, but there's this guy
who really likes me.

50:22.528 --> 50:26.294
He explores the storerooms,
especially the ones on the edges.

50:26.365 --> 50:29.198
They're marked empty in the ledger,
but they're not all empty.

50:29.268 --> 50:31.930
I'll give you a bite
if you promise not to tell.

50:34.840 --> 50:38.037
- It's wrong, Lizzie.
- Well, he says it's all gonna be gone soon anyway.

50:38.110 --> 50:40.476
Why not live as well
as we can right now?

50:40.546 --> 50:42.537
There he is.

50:54.093 --> 50:56.152
Doon!

50:56.228 --> 50:58.219
Have you-

51:01.400 --> 51:03.334
<i>Doon!</i>

51:08.307 --> 51:10.241
I need to tell you something.

51:10.309 --> 51:13.244
<i>It was Looper we saw</i>
<i>near that 351 door.</i>

51:13.312 --> 51:15.803
Before that, I took a message
to the mayor for him.

51:18.584 --> 51:21.576
<i>I'll bet there's something big</i>
<i>on the other side of that door.</i>

51:42.474 --> 51:44.465
<i>There's so much food.</i>

52:16.341 --> 52:18.275
Go.

52:28.253 --> 52:31.347
And I thought he was lying
when he talked about finding a solution.

52:31.423 --> 52:33.357
He wasn't lying.

52:33.425 --> 52:35.586
He's found his solution.

52:35.661 --> 52:37.993
Poppy. Lie down, okay?

52:38.063 --> 52:40.122
It's time to go to sleep.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.929
Could you just pump those pedals?

52:43.001 --> 52:45.196
What is this?

52:45.270 --> 52:48.865
It's the answering machine tape
from my parents' phone.

52:48.941 --> 52:51.000
When we still had one.

52:51.076 --> 52:54.443
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo!

52:54.513 --> 52:56.447
Anybody home?

52:56.515 --> 53:00.007
<i>Don't hold dinner for me, darling.</i>

53:00.085 --> 53:02.110
- That's my dad's voice.
<i>- I'll be there before lights out.</i>

53:04.022 --> 53:08.288
Raine, it's me, Barrow.
I've been thinkin' about it.

53:08.360 --> 53:12.592
I watch my boy,
and... I've come around.

53:12.664 --> 53:16.225
I've changed my mind. I'm in.

53:17.369 --> 53:19.701
What's wrong?

53:23.542 --> 53:26.170
He lied to me.

53:26.245 --> 53:28.873
Where are you going?

53:28.947 --> 53:31.711
Well, meet me
at the Greenhouses, okay?

53:31.783 --> 53:34.217
<i>Good night, young man.</i>

53:34.286 --> 53:37.084
How was your rehearsal?

53:39.157 --> 53:41.648
For the Singing.

53:41.727 --> 53:45.185
Oh. I-It was fine.

53:45.264 --> 53:48.358
- It was really good.
- Good.

53:48.433 --> 53:51.425
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>

53:54.139 --> 53:57.040
Dad. I heard you.

53:57.109 --> 53:59.202
<i>I heard you on the answering-</i>

53:59.278 --> 54:03.146
Lina Mayfleet has her parents'
old answering machine tape.

54:03.215 --> 54:06.048
I heard you.
You said her dad could count you in.

54:10.188 --> 54:12.918
You tried to leave the city, didn't you?

54:14.226 --> 54:16.717
W-Why would I do that?

54:16.795 --> 54:18.456
Because of me.

54:27.306 --> 54:29.206
Dad.

54:29.274 --> 54:31.208
<i>Please.</i>

54:33.812 --> 54:36.804
- We were wrong.
- No, you were right.

54:36.882 --> 54:38.816
There is an exit.

54:38.884 --> 54:42.115
Yeah. Raine thought so, too,
and it got him killed, Son.

54:42.187 --> 54:44.348
Dad, there's a way out
in the Pipeworks...

54:44.423 --> 54:46.482
but you have to tell me
everything that you know.

54:46.558 --> 54:49.925
- Tell me what you know.
- I don't know anything, and neither do you.

54:51.563 --> 54:53.531
<i>The Builders left Instructions.</i>

54:53.599 --> 54:55.624
The Builders abandoned us.

54:55.701 --> 54:58.465
No, they didn't.
They didn't, Dad. I have proof.

55:02.074 --> 55:03.974
Show me.

55:20.225 --> 55:22.853
Wait!

55:22.928 --> 55:25.863
Oh. Happy Great Day of Singing,
young lady.

55:25.931 --> 55:28.764
I need to speak to you in private.

55:28.834 --> 55:31.098
Very well then.

55:31.169 --> 55:34.605
What I need to tell you is secret
and really important.

55:34.673 --> 55:37.335
- What is it?
- The mayor- He's got a bunker in the Pipeworks.

55:37.409 --> 55:39.400
It's filled with food.

55:41.747 --> 55:44.238
The shortages aren't as bad
as everyone thinks.

55:46.451 --> 55:49.545
You mean the mayor is stealing?

55:49.621 --> 55:52.920
Looper, who works in the storerooms,
is helping him.

55:55.427 --> 55:57.418
Well, this is shocking.

55:58.597 --> 56:02.089
Shocking. I'm shocked.

56:04.202 --> 56:07.535
Um, we have to report this.

56:07.606 --> 56:09.540
Come with me.

56:09.608 --> 56:11.673
Well done, Lina Mayfleet.

56:11.674 --> 56:13.738
Once you arrest him, Doon and I can show you where the room is -

56:13.812 --> 56:16.280
<i>Wait. Where are we going?</i>

56:39.271 --> 56:41.171
I beg your pardon, Your Honor.

56:41.239 --> 56:44.766
<i>You remember Lina Mayfleet?</i>

56:44.843 --> 56:46.902
She wants to accuse you.

56:49.147 --> 56:51.081
Accuse me of what?

56:51.149 --> 56:53.344
Of stealing food
from the people of Ember.

56:55.487 --> 56:59.389
I love my city and everyone in it.

57:04.930 --> 57:06.921
And I would never think
to do such a thing.

57:06.998 --> 57:09.125
We saw your room!
We saw you in it!

57:10.302 --> 57:14.068
- "We"?
- She and her friend, Doon Harrow.

57:17.776 --> 57:20.711
What's that box?

57:20.779 --> 57:22.713
<i>Hmm.</i>

57:22.781 --> 57:24.715
It's mine.

57:26.151 --> 57:28.881
It's unusual looking.

57:28.954 --> 57:32.219
Where'd you get that?

57:36.228 --> 57:38.662
You're related to one of the mayors.

57:38.730 --> 57:41.221
Yes. Uh, he was the seventh mayor.

57:48.073 --> 57:51.304
A lot of things got lost
when the seventh mayor passed.

57:52.310 --> 57:54.301
May I look at that box, Lina?

57:54.379 --> 57:58.315
- Why?
- What's inside the box, Lina?

57:58.383 --> 58:02.513
I imagine it's official
mayor-related business.

58:03.822 --> 58:06.347
<i>Box. Give it to me.</i>

58:06.424 --> 58:08.949
- It's not yours.
- Give me the box!

58:09.027 --> 58:11.587
- No!
- Get it from her. Now.

58:12.597 --> 58:14.622
<i>Take it from her! Move!</i>

58:14.699 --> 58:16.997
<i>Grab her!</i>

58:17.068 --> 58:20.629
Have you got her?

58:39.891 --> 58:41.552
Get her.

58:54.639 --> 58:57.199
Stop! After her!

59:16.161 --> 59:19.096
Is this the home of Doon Harrow?

59:19.164 --> 59:21.325
Is he here?

59:21.399 --> 59:25.233
I-I-I can't hear. I have a weak ear.
Y-You have to talk louder.

59:25.303 --> 59:27.828
- Doon Harrow!
- Doon Harro- No, Loris.

59:27.906 --> 59:31.000
We're looking for Doon Harrow.
He's charged with treason against the city.

59:31.076 --> 59:34.705
That's terrible.
If it's true, he's no son of mine!

59:34.779 --> 59:37.247
<i>Treason is the worst offense</i>
<i>anyone could possibly commit.</i>

59:37.315 --> 59:41.445
Builders were wise when they said,
"If you have proof, you have to pursue it!

59:41.519 --> 59:45.353
<i>There's more to a bottle cap than</i>
<i>keeping liquid from leaking out of glass!''</i>

59:45.423 --> 59:47.254
- Get him!
- Uh, we'll go this way.

59:47.325 --> 59:50.988
Doon! The guards are here!
You traitor!

59:51.062 --> 59:53.394
- In here. Follow him.
- They're comin' to get you!

59:54.499 --> 59:56.729
The keypad is somewhere.

59:56.801 --> 59:58.996
What's he doin'?

59:59.070 --> 01:00:01.061
- Just one second.
<i>- He's crazy.</i>

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.869
<i>- Is this the way to your apartment?</i>
- Apparently not.

01:00:16.621 --> 01:00:19.818
<i>Upstairs!</i>

01:00:29.067 --> 01:00:31.001
- They're after me!
- Who?

01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:33.003
- Guards!
- Why?

01:00:33.071 --> 01:00:35.130
Doon and I, we- Quick.

01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:38.266
<i>What is this all about?</i>
<i>We'll be late for the Great Day of Singing.</i>

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.277
Well, excuse me, ma'am.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.472
I'm- I'm looking for Lina Mayfleet.

01:00:42.547 --> 01:00:44.811
Well, she's not here. She's probably
already in Harken Square.

01:00:44.883 --> 01:00:46.583
Okay, okay. Well, I guess
I'll just have a look for myself.

01:00:46.584 --> 01:00:48.284
Oh! Excuse me.

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:51.083
Beg your pardon! So sorry.

01:00:54.159 --> 01:00:58.562
<i>You know, the mayor did</i>
<i>ask for her specifically.</i>

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:01.827
The Greenhouse. Uh, she was meeting
a friend at the Greenhouse.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.834
<i>Does that help?</i>

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:36.029
Careful!
That's food you're destroying!

01:01:36.101 --> 01:01:38.501
Our food!

01:01:42.374 --> 01:01:44.308
<i>Psst!</i>

01:02:07.132 --> 01:02:09.066
A warning:

01:02:09.134 --> 01:02:12.831
If I discover you were helping, harboring
or otherwise assisting those kids-

01:02:12.904 --> 01:02:14.895
Why would I do that?

01:02:18.543 --> 01:02:21.011
I have information
they were coming this way.

01:02:21.079 --> 01:02:23.070
Who provided you
with that information?

01:02:23.148 --> 01:02:25.582
That's confidential.

01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:30.144
All I need for you to understand is this:
If you're involved, you'll regret it.

01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:34.917
<i>- Anything you hear, anything you see...</i>

01:02:34.993 --> 01:02:37.018
you tell me.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.398
Otherwise,
there will be consequences.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:45.198
Should anything happen in the future
that you hear of or see...

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.204
<i>I'll expect to be informed.</i>

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.936
I don't need to tell you
that I have the mayor's ear.

01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:03.977
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.616
Okay.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:35.744
Leave two guards behind!

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.345
We've gotta find a way out of here.

01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:40.323
Now.

01:03:47.765 --> 01:03:49.699
What is this?

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.107
My dad made this.

01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:06.039
It doesn't look very safe.

01:04:06.117 --> 01:04:08.608
That's my dad.

01:04:12.624 --> 01:04:14.615
Everything he makes looks like this.

01:04:14.692 --> 01:04:17.024
What do you mean, your dad?

01:04:17.095 --> 01:04:20.690
Barrow. His voice is on
your answering machine.

01:04:20.765 --> 01:04:23.529
But your dad's name is Loris.

01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:27.037
Barrow Harrow. It's his nickname.

01:04:27.105 --> 01:04:29.972
- After some wheelbarrow he used to push around.
- You're the boy!

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:34.071
That means our parents
were trying to escape together.

01:04:35.213 --> 01:04:37.704
They were trying.

01:04:37.782 --> 01:04:41.513
We're running out of time.
They'll come back for us.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.370
Pedal!

01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:07.403
Now, you stay here and be a good girl.

01:05:07.478 --> 01:05:09.708
Okay? And look for me up there.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:12.909
- Where's Lina?
- Oh, I'm- She's here somewhere.

01:05:17.655 --> 01:05:20.522
- Can you see anything?
- Barely.

01:05:33.037 --> 01:05:35.972
Here it is again-
the moment in the year...

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.635
when we pause to celebrate
our fair city.

01:05:39.711 --> 01:05:42.077
This beacon of light...

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:43.943
in a world of darkness.

01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:47.284
Hold on!

01:06:01.699 --> 01:06:03.633
Okay. That stuff- Cover it.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.770
This miracle of planning...

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:13.902
<i>this magnificent achievement...</i>

01:06:13.978 --> 01:06:18.176
that is our city of Ember.

01:06:26.758 --> 01:06:29.352
#This is all we know #

01:06:29.427 --> 01:06:32.157
# Ember is forever #

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.858
#When the light comes on #

01:06:34.932 --> 01:06:38.129
# I will be with you #

01:06:38.336 --> 01:06:40.998
#When the light comes on #

01:06:41.072 --> 01:06:44.041
# Hope is everlasting #

01:06:44.108 --> 01:06:45.803
They started singing.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:50.940
<i># The morning light</i>
<i>Spend some time with you #</i>

01:06:53.918 --> 01:06:57.718
Oh, I've gotta show you.
The mayor had one too.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:02.549
- He gave this to you?
- Not exactly.

01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:18.975
The Generator.

01:07:19.043 --> 01:07:21.739
Okay. We have to get there.

01:07:21.813 --> 01:07:24.043
We have to get there now.

01:07:24.115 --> 01:07:26.049
Come on.

01:07:26.117 --> 01:07:28.483
Wait! Poppy.

01:07:28.553 --> 01:07:32.819
# I will be with you #

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:35.085
#This is all we know #

01:07:35.159 --> 01:07:38.219
<i># Ember is forever#</i>

01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:40.662
- #When the light comes on #
<i>- Yoo-hoo!</i>

01:07:40.732 --> 01:07:43.895
# I will be with you #

01:07:43.968 --> 01:07:46.903
- #This is all we know #
<i>- Yoo-hoo!</i>

01:07:46.971 --> 01:07:50.236
# Ember is forever #

01:07:50.308 --> 01:07:52.776
- #When the light comes on #
<i>- Yoo-hoo!</i>

01:07:52.844 --> 01:07:56.712
# I will be with you #

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.807
- #When the light comes on #
- Come here.

01:07:59.884 --> 01:08:03.581
# Hope is everlasting ##

01:08:20.604 --> 01:08:22.970
That's it.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.970
Poppy.

01:08:32.049 --> 01:08:34.540
<i>Maybe he knows.</i>

01:08:34.618 --> 01:08:36.984
Sul. Sul.

01:08:37.054 --> 01:08:39.215
Okay, we have to get him on his feet.

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:43.488
Wake up. Sul, is there a key
to the Generator door?

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.495
Sure, there's a key.

01:08:45.563 --> 01:08:47.997
Great. Where is it?

01:08:48.064 --> 01:08:50.625
How should I know?
It's not my job.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.944
Wait.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.241
Something's not right.

01:09:06.317 --> 01:09:09.616
The Builders were smart.
They would have made it simple.

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.951
I wouldn't call any of this simple.

01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:16.491
They would have thought it through.

01:09:18.429 --> 01:09:20.363
They planned...

01:09:28.238 --> 01:09:30.173
everything.

01:09:38.249 --> 01:09:40.183
Doon.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.524
There's something behind those lockers.

01:09:49.961 --> 01:09:52.395
Poppy, come on. Let's go. Quick.

01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:59.133
There's gotta be a way in.

01:10:34.205 --> 01:10:36.605
What... are these for?

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.108
"Bo-at."

01:10:41.178 --> 01:10:43.169
"Boat."

01:10:48.319 --> 01:10:50.787
Okay. "Release by"-

01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:52.447
<i>- "Rotating''-</i>
- Something.

01:10:52.523 --> 01:10:54.354
<i>- "Mechanism clockwise. ''</i>
- "Clockwise."

01:10:57.695 --> 01:11:00.323
It's that. It has to be.

01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:03.060
Okay.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:29.626
Poppy!

01:11:40.571 --> 01:11:42.562
There's more coming.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:47.106
There's another one. Look.

01:13:14.799 --> 01:13:17.597
<i>The water level is too low!</i>
<i>It's gonna hit.</i>

01:13:20.404 --> 01:13:23.202
It should have moved out of the way.

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:26.539
We're not supposed to skip ahead.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:30.637
- We need to follow the Instructions exactly.
- Okay.

01:13:30.715 --> 01:13:32.706
It's what the Builders
would have wanted.

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:34.717
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay. Um-

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.720
<i>"Access''-</i>
<i>Something, something.</i>

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.348
- "1 room."
- 1 room.

01:13:40.424 --> 01:13:42.790
Room-

01:13:48.666 --> 01:13:51.965
<i>Come on, Poppy.</i>
<i>Come on. Move it.</i>

01:14:01.178 --> 01:14:03.476
It wasn't "1 room"
we were looking for.

01:14:03.547 --> 01:14:07.210
It was "L."
"Emergency Control Room."

01:14:08.686 --> 01:14:11.177
Okay.

01:14:11.255 --> 01:14:13.587
The cards. Let's try the cards.

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:15.591
Okay.

01:14:28.405 --> 01:14:30.339
Oh, come on!

01:14:30.407 --> 01:14:32.466
Come on!

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.116
Nice work, Poppy.

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.252
Okay.

01:15:12.249 --> 01:15:14.717
Are you okay?

01:16:01.232 --> 01:16:03.700
The cards. Get the cards.

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:17.276
"Set waterwheel 1 to full thrust."

01:16:17.348 --> 01:16:20.283
Waterwheel 1. Full thrust.

01:16:27.258 --> 01:16:31.194
<i>Okay. It's moving.</i>
<i>Okay. What's next?</i>

01:16:31.262 --> 01:16:33.526
Um, "Set waterwheel 2 to full stop."

01:16:33.597 --> 01:16:36.122
Waterwheel 2. Full stop.

01:16:53.684 --> 01:16:55.413
It's stuck.

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:15.301
Sul.

01:17:16.573 --> 01:17:18.507
<i>Sul!</i>

01:17:20.311 --> 01:17:22.245
Stay here.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.121
<i>Sul! Sul!</i>

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:34.919
Go away, boy! Go away!

01:17:34.992 --> 01:17:37.153
Sul, what are you doing up here?

01:17:37.227 --> 01:17:40.754
This thing is jammed stuck!
I've gotta free it.

01:17:40.831 --> 01:17:42.992
How do you know
that's what you should do?

01:17:46.837 --> 01:17:49.237
It's my job!

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:53.366
Aah! Nothing's working.

01:17:53.444 --> 01:17:55.469
Try this!

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.311
It's beginning to move!

01:18:06.357 --> 01:18:08.689
It's moving!

01:18:10.761 --> 01:18:13.355
- It's working, Sul!
- It's working!

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:16.831
Sul, this is the exit!
It's the way out of Ember!

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.664
- To where, boy?
- We'll find out!

01:18:46.497 --> 01:18:48.988
#The Builders have always known #

01:18:49.066 --> 01:18:55.027
# But you and you and you ##

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.617
Hold on!

01:19:15.859 --> 01:19:17.884
Doon!

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:20.623
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

01:19:28.439 --> 01:19:30.964
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:39.782
<i># About you and you #</i>

01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:42.785
#And you ##

01:20:05.876 --> 01:20:08.777
Poppy!

01:20:10.013 --> 01:20:12.982
Sul, come on! Now!
We've gotta go now! Come on!

01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:16.577
- I've got to keep this open!
- Sul, come now! Come with me!

01:20:16.653 --> 01:20:19.520
You go! Now!

01:20:22.092 --> 01:20:23.923
It's all right!

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.495
Are you okay?

01:20:35.572 --> 01:20:39.099
- Okay. Get in!
- Did you see what happened to the first one?

01:20:39.176 --> 01:20:41.770
We don't have any choice. Come on!

01:20:50.354 --> 01:20:52.288
Hold on, Poppy.

01:21:01.298 --> 01:21:03.232
<i>It's lowering.</i>

01:21:50.314 --> 01:21:55.013
<i>Mayor Cole?</i>

01:21:56.587 --> 01:21:59.317
I made it.

01:21:59.389 --> 01:22:03.086
What are you doing?
You can't leave me here!

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.958
Wait!

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.440
No. No!

01:22:20.043 --> 01:22:22.944
We had a deal. Wait. Wait!

01:22:24.381 --> 01:22:28.112
It was you and me!
Open the door!

01:22:28.185 --> 01:22:31.245
We had a deal! We had a deal!

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:34.916
<i>Open the door! Open the door.</i>

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.926
<i>Not fair!</i>

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:38.985
<i>You said!</i>

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.518
<i>Doon, to the right! The right!</i>

01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:08.490
I'm trying!

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.351
- Drop!
<i>- Hold on!</i>

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:33.492
There's something up ahead.

01:25:42.913 --> 01:25:44.847
Okay.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:07.658
They were right.

01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:10.063
There's nothing but darkness.

01:28:03.687 --> 01:28:05.621
Lina.

01:28:28.545 --> 01:28:30.604
It's blue.

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:45.987
<i>Ember! You can see it!</i>

01:28:46.062 --> 01:28:48.121
Hello!

01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:51.634
They won't hear you.
It's way too far.

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:53.999
Well-Well, we've gotta
tell them somehow.

01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:56.334
We need to tell them what's up here.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:02.004
<i> Lina and Doon</i>
<i>tied their hope to a rock...</i>

01:29:02.078 --> 01:29:04.740
<i>and tossed it down toward the city.</i>

01:29:12.989 --> 01:29:16.083
<i>The rock could've ended up on a roof.</i>

01:29:18.762 --> 01:29:20.753
<i>Or kicked into a gutter.</i>

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.390
<i>But fate ran another course.</i>

01:29:27.871 --> 01:29:30.669
<i>And the message found its way.</i>

01:29:39.249 --> 01:29:41.843
<i>Now the path was clear for all.</i>

01:29:44.354 --> 01:29:48.051
<i>All of us who kept</i>
<i>the flame of Ember burning...</i>

01:29:48.124 --> 01:29:50.490
<i>through the darkness...</i>

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.552
<i>so that we could live again</i>
<i>on the earth...</i>

01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:56.190
<i>in the air and the light.</i>
