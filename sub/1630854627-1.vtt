<i>Action Pack</i>

00:16.375 --> 00:18.291
<i>Here we go</i>

00:18.375 --> 00:21.708
<i>We always shine so bright</i>
<i>We'll help you make it right</i>

00:21.791 --> 00:23.750
<i>Heart, smarts, and mega might</i>

00:23.833 --> 00:25.375
<i>Ready for action</i>

00:25.458 --> 00:26.375
Watts!

00:27.416 --> 00:29.000
<i>Bring on adventure</i>

00:29.083 --> 00:30.208
Clay!

00:30.750 --> 00:32.625
<i>Yeah, we've got your back</i>

00:32.708 --> 00:33.541
Wren!

00:34.666 --> 00:36.500
<i>Nothing stands in our way</i>

00:36.583 --> 00:37.625
Treena!

00:38.541 --> 00:40.875
<i>We are the Action Pack!</i>

00:49.000 --> 00:49.833
All right!

00:49.916 --> 00:52.541
-We've got it!
-Plant-tastic!

00:54.666 --> 00:55.958
Come on, let's go!

01:01.000 --> 01:01.958
Perfect.

01:02.041 --> 01:03.708
Plasma-powered prettying.

01:03.791 --> 01:05.625
And I'll light the menorah.

01:08.166 --> 01:09.958
Mission accomplished!

01:10.041 --> 01:11.208
-Yeah!
-All right!

01:14.708 --> 01:16.541
Feliz Navidad!

01:17.125 --> 01:19.708
Look at all these presents!

01:19.791 --> 01:23.208
Nothing's better than
a grizzly-bear-big stack of presents

01:23.291 --> 01:24.875
with your name on them.

01:24.958 --> 01:26.291
Hot Sparks!

01:26.375 --> 01:27.750
Is this one for me?

01:27.833 --> 01:28.666
Yeppers.

01:28.750 --> 01:32.833
I had so much fun making Hanukkah presents
when we celebrated with you, Watts,

01:32.916 --> 01:35.791
that I made Christmas presents
for everyone too.

01:35.875 --> 01:39.291
Oh, holidays make me
hamster-hedgehog-hummingbird happy!

01:39.375 --> 01:40.541
Can I open it?

01:40.625 --> 01:43.791
Nuh-uh, Watts.
It's Hope Springs' Christmas tradition

01:43.875 --> 01:46.208
that you don't open gifts
until the gift exchange

01:46.291 --> 01:47.875
at the tree lighting ceremony.

01:47.958 --> 01:51.500
Right. Presents happen
<i>after</i> I help light the tree.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.083
Zip!

01:53.583 --> 01:54.541
Zap!

01:54.625 --> 01:57.708
-Watts!
-The crowd cheers! They chant my name!

01:57.791 --> 02:00.125
-That's me. Thank you.
-Watts!

02:00.208 --> 02:01.791
-Watts!
-Yes?

02:01.875 --> 02:04.166
Light the tree, not the teacher.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.541
Oops! Sorry, Mr Ernesto.

02:09.125 --> 02:13.500
Wow, Action Pack! Mission Decorate
The Action Academy is complete.

02:14.666 --> 02:16.208
Hoodies down, team.

02:16.791 --> 02:19.125
You kids are clear
to go to the tree lighting.

02:19.208 --> 02:20.750
Grab your gifts for the exchange,

02:20.833 --> 02:23.250
and I'll be there as soon
as my cookies are done.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.416
Yeah!

02:27.625 --> 02:31.708
<i>Dashing through the snow</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

02:31.791 --> 02:35.666
<i>O'er the fields we go</i>
<i>Laughing all the way…</i>

02:35.750 --> 02:38.083
Everybody loves winter!

02:38.166 --> 02:40.791
<i>Making spirits bright</i>
<i>What fun it is to…</i>

02:40.875 --> 02:43.500
It's too early for Christmas music!

02:43.583 --> 02:46.625
Oh, Mr Grumpman, it's Christmas Eve!

02:46.708 --> 02:48.541
Oh, fiddlesticks.

02:48.625 --> 02:51.708
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

02:51.791 --> 02:53.041
Ah, Matthew.

02:53.125 --> 02:58.083
As my first toy, you understand that being
the child of a Von Taker toy tycoon

02:58.166 --> 03:00.750
means that I get every toy
made in Hope Springs.

03:00.833 --> 03:06.041
But I, Teddy Von Taker, need more toys,
toys not built in Hope Springs.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.541
And to take them, I need more power.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.833
That's where my
Christmas Cheer-Taker comes in.

03:11.916 --> 03:16.583
Once I get the Christmas cheer,
I'll be ready for Santa tonight.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.416
It's a flurry of white!

03:21.250 --> 03:24.791
There's a kid with Christmas cheer!
Shall we, Matthew?

03:26.791 --> 03:28.958
Time to take the cheer away.

03:30.291 --> 03:31.375
Yay!

03:31.458 --> 03:33.208
Winter!

03:34.833 --> 03:35.875
-Whatever.
-Whatever.

03:35.958 --> 03:37.416
Whatever.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.750
It's just snow.

03:40.416 --> 03:44.875
It's working! More cheer for me,
less cheer for everyone else!

03:44.958 --> 03:46.166
<i>Jingle bells…</i>

03:46.250 --> 03:49.083
I'll be taking your cheer too.

03:49.166 --> 03:53.708
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!</i>

03:53.791 --> 03:55.666
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

03:55.750 --> 03:57.833
-Oh, hot dog.
-Let's go.

03:57.916 --> 04:00.291
I don't really feel like singing.

04:02.083 --> 04:05.375
Finally, I can enjoy Christmas in peace.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.333
Why isn't my Cheer-Taker working?

04:15.416 --> 04:18.041
You think you're just
gonna suck out all the cheer

04:18.125 --> 04:21.458
to power up that battery thingamajig?

04:21.541 --> 04:24.000
Well, I don't have any cheer to take!

04:27.416 --> 04:30.125
I say the joke is on you, sir.

04:30.208 --> 04:33.166
You have a little cheer
in there after all.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.750
Oh, fiddlesticks.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.416
More cheer, more power for me!

04:48.875 --> 04:53.875
And then, one Christmas I got an art kit,
and it had paint and glitter and--

04:56.708 --> 04:57.708
Why are they leaving?

04:57.791 --> 05:01.000
This Christmas party
isn't looking like a party at all.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.541
Let's see what's going on.

05:04.291 --> 05:08.750
-What's wrong, Cold Snap?
-I don't feel like celebrating. Goodbye.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.791
What? I thought Cold Snap
would love Christmas.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.791
Maybe he celebrates something else?

05:13.875 --> 05:18.625
Well, Hanukkah's all about being with
your family, and kindness, and giving too.

05:18.708 --> 05:22.083
And all of those things make me happy,
so I don't think that's it.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.833
Something strange is going on here.

05:24.916 --> 05:27.833
This place should be bubbling
with Christmas cheer.

05:27.916 --> 05:30.500
<i>Did someone say Christmas cheer?</i>

05:31.083 --> 05:32.375
Teddy Von Taker?!

05:32.458 --> 05:37.208
<i>Why, hello, Action Pack.</i>
<i>You have just the cheer I'm here to take.</i>

05:37.916 --> 05:43.125
Wonderful! The Toy Tycoon
Multi-Purpose Gauntlet is quite handy.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.833
Take our cheer? What does he mean?

05:45.916 --> 05:48.416
I don't know. But we better find out.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.833
Action Pack, circle up, hoodies up, and…

05:51.916 --> 05:53.041
Take action!

05:53.125 --> 05:54.250
<i>Action Pack</i>

05:54.958 --> 05:56.875
<i>Here we go</i>

05:58.833 --> 06:02.291
Treena, mighty flowers and plant power!

06:03.125 --> 06:06.916
Clay, plasma power and Invinci-ball!

06:08.083 --> 06:12.208
Wren, changing up
with animal powers. Roar!

06:12.791 --> 06:16.583
Watts, supercharged electric zaps!

06:22.291 --> 06:24.916
<i>I'm tired of waiting, Action Pack!</i>

06:25.458 --> 06:26.625
So loud!

06:27.791 --> 06:30.416
Oh, pardon me. Microphone off.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.708
I'm just here to take your cheer.

06:32.791 --> 06:35.708
Watch out! Action on, Invinci-ball!

06:36.583 --> 06:37.666
Butterfly Wings!

06:39.958 --> 06:41.333
Oh Zap!

06:42.416 --> 06:43.583
It's not working!

06:43.666 --> 06:47.333
Hey! Taking people's
Christmas cheer is not nice!

06:47.416 --> 06:49.166
Being all cheery, happy, smiley,

06:49.250 --> 06:52.458
and full of feel-good feels
is what Christmas is all abou--

06:52.541 --> 06:53.583
Wren!

06:53.666 --> 06:55.958
Don't worry, I'll stop this.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.458
Electric Blast!

07:02.041 --> 07:05.833
Fully charged and ready
to take for phase two.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.791
-Wren!
-Oh no!

07:08.875 --> 07:13.416
I won't even need the cheer from the rest
of the Action Pack. Ready, Matthew?

07:14.458 --> 07:15.416
Then let's go.

07:20.916 --> 07:23.125
-Are you okay?
-How do you feel?

07:23.208 --> 07:24.416
I'm okay.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.833
I just feel nothing.

07:27.416 --> 07:30.291
Oh no! He actually took
her Christmas cheer.

07:30.375 --> 07:31.791
Why would Teddy do that?

07:31.875 --> 07:36.666
Well, Mr Ernesto did teach us
that Christmas cheer is really powerful.

07:36.750 --> 07:41.791
Oh Zap! With all Wren's cheer,
Teddy Von Taker will be mega-powered!

07:41.875 --> 07:44.291
I think we need a plan of action. Treena?

07:44.375 --> 07:47.333
You got it.
Our mission is to save Christmas.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.000
<i>We have to stop Teddy Von Taker</i>

07:50.083 --> 07:53.375
<i>from doing whatever he plans</i>
<i>to do with that cheer power.</i>

07:54.500 --> 07:58.166
<i>Then we need to figure out</i>
<i>how to get the cheer out of that battery</i>

07:58.250 --> 07:59.750
<i>and back into the people.</i>

08:00.541 --> 08:02.125
<i>Then I'll light up the tree!</i>

08:03.166 --> 08:04.500
<i>That is a plan.</i>

08:06.291 --> 08:07.333
Action on!

08:07.416 --> 08:08.875
Action on,

08:08.958 --> 08:10.041
I guess.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.875
Hold it right there, Teddy Von Taker.

08:13.958 --> 08:15.041
Bye!

08:16.750 --> 08:18.583
Give that cheer back, or I'll--

08:19.125 --> 08:20.500
Hot Sparks!

08:20.583 --> 08:24.833
Is that really an UltraFly Zoom Board 2.0?
Can I try it?

08:24.916 --> 08:29.125
Actually, it's the 3.0 version
with advanced agility.

08:30.625 --> 08:31.916
Bye!

08:38.791 --> 08:39.916
-What?
-Gotcha!

08:40.000 --> 08:40.833
Yeah!

08:44.875 --> 08:46.708
Release the penguins!

08:55.833 --> 08:57.041
Watch out!

08:57.125 --> 08:58.833
Distract those heroes by…

09:00.875 --> 09:03.083
destroying that Christmas tree!

09:06.208 --> 09:07.583
Don't hurt the tree!

09:10.166 --> 09:12.291
Petal-copter Power!

09:12.875 --> 09:15.916
If they destroy the tree,
then I won't be able to light it.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.875
Penguins. Meh.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.250
Wren! Invinci-ball!

09:26.208 --> 09:28.875
Invinci-ball. How unexpected.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.166
Petal Flurry!

09:36.666 --> 09:39.125
This tree is under our protection.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.875
Not the presents!

09:48.125 --> 09:49.583
Electric Trail!

09:52.041 --> 09:53.375
Oh yeah!

09:53.916 --> 09:55.916
-All right!
-Way to grow, buds.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.000
-No!
-Invinci-ball!

10:04.833 --> 10:08.125
-What do we do?
-There are too many penguins!

10:10.375 --> 10:11.708
Do you hear that?

10:15.416 --> 10:16.375
What is that?

10:17.375 --> 10:18.708
Penguins!

10:20.000 --> 10:21.791
You're on my naughty list.

10:46.791 --> 10:51.208
Super Santa and Striker are here
to save Christmas!

10:51.291 --> 10:55.875
-Incredible!
-Santa Claus is a superhero?

10:55.958 --> 10:57.458
Santa. That's nice.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.708
Action Pack, I brought cookies!

11:00.416 --> 11:01.458
Santa?!

11:01.541 --> 11:02.666
I know who you are.

11:02.750 --> 11:07.541
Ernesto Action, top of the nice list
for the past 27 years.

11:08.416 --> 11:10.458
Meet my reindeer, Striker.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.708
Action Pack, I was out delivering presents

11:18.791 --> 11:21.375
when I received a red and green alert
on the naughty list

11:21.458 --> 11:26.041
that Hope Springs' Christmas cheer
was taken by Teddy Von Taker.

11:26.125 --> 11:29.541
Well, I'm here to get that cheer back.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.500
What do you think
he's trying to do with the cheer, Santa?

11:32.583 --> 11:36.791
Well, I don't know. You see,
Christmas cheer is usually used for good,

11:36.875 --> 11:40.166
helping others, spreading joy, giving.

11:40.250 --> 11:44.750
But the raw power of Christmas cheer
can also be used for bad.

11:44.833 --> 11:46.916
It could power
all sorts of villain devices.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.916
I have to save Christmas!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.458
Excuse me, Super Santa, sir.

11:51.541 --> 11:53.333
I mean, Mr Claus.

11:53.416 --> 11:57.166
-Your mission is our mission too.
-And we'd love to help.

11:57.791 --> 12:02.916
Well, Santa always needs
a few little helpers, that's for sure.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.333
But first, we must get Wren
feeling like her cheerful self again.

12:07.416 --> 12:11.791
And to fill her full of Christmas cheer,
we'll need her presents.

12:12.958 --> 12:16.333
Presents! This one's for Wren!
And that one!

12:17.083 --> 12:19.083
You misunderstood, Watts.

12:19.166 --> 12:20.916
Getting presents is great,

12:21.000 --> 12:26.125
but the quickest way to gain
Christmas cheer is by giving.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.833
Hey, Wren, get the present
you bought for Clay.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.083
Okay, if you say so.

12:32.625 --> 12:33.875
For you, Clay.

12:34.708 --> 12:39.750
<i>The Exciting Adventures of Clay.</i>
Wow, you made a comic for me?

12:39.833 --> 12:41.916
It's my favourite present.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.958
Thanks, Wren!

12:45.125 --> 12:47.083
And one for Treena.

12:47.791 --> 12:49.166
A flower pot!

12:49.250 --> 12:51.583
I painted the flowers just for you.

12:51.666 --> 12:52.750
Thank you, Wren!

12:54.250 --> 12:57.208
-And the last one is for Watts.
-Yes!

12:57.291 --> 13:01.166
Hot Sparks! You made a drawing of me
with the Crimson Cape?

13:01.250 --> 13:04.541
We look so cool! Can I get a hug, Wren?

13:04.625 --> 13:06.083
Abso-toucan-lutely!

13:07.291 --> 13:08.250
Group hug!

13:09.666 --> 13:10.583
Santa?

13:11.833 --> 13:15.291
Santa's here! Are you ready
to save Christmas? 'Cause I am!

13:15.375 --> 13:19.375
Hi, Striker. I want to hear
all about being a reindeer.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.291
Yeah? Really?

13:22.916 --> 13:25.416
Wow, I didn't understand a word you said,

13:25.500 --> 13:28.458
'cause I don't speak reindeer,
but I love the way you snort.

13:28.541 --> 13:32.291
-What?
-Ah, Mr Ernesto, welcome back.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.166
I'll need you to run Mission Control

13:34.250 --> 13:36.375
while we go to Teddy's hideout
to wait for him.

13:36.458 --> 13:41.041
Me? Mission Control for you?
The big guy in the red suit?!

13:41.791 --> 13:44.166
I'd be honoured, sir! Come on, Plunky!

13:45.000 --> 13:48.833
Action Pack, be smart,
be safe, be superheroes!

13:48.916 --> 13:49.916
Action on!

13:51.750 --> 13:56.291
For Hanukkah, we celebrate eight nights,
and we get presents every night.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.791
Oh, that sounds amazing, Watts.

13:58.875 --> 14:03.250
Lighting the way, you say.
That reminds me of someone else.

14:04.666 --> 14:05.750
There he is!

14:09.708 --> 14:13.333
See, Matthew? Everything is working out
just according to--

14:13.416 --> 14:15.041
Teddy Von Taker!

14:15.583 --> 14:20.541
Hello, Santa. Isn't it a bit early
for you to be in Hope Springs?

14:20.625 --> 14:23.416
It is, but he was alerted
because of what you did,

14:23.500 --> 14:25.083
and now we're here to stop you.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.791
I'm taking this cheer and returning it
to the people of Hope Springs.

14:28.875 --> 14:29.708
Sure.

14:29.791 --> 14:32.916
But first, won't you join me for a snack?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.041
Milk and cookies?

14:39.583 --> 14:41.708
Milk and cookies!

14:41.791 --> 14:42.625
-Santa!
-No!

14:42.708 --> 14:44.875
-It's a trap!
-Don't do it!

14:44.958 --> 14:48.000
-Santa, stop!
-Milk and cookies!

14:48.083 --> 14:50.041
The Invinci-ball is breaking!

14:52.583 --> 14:55.750
-We'll do it together, old sport.
-Cookies.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.458
Cookies.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.708
-A force field!
-Leaping lemurs!

15:03.458 --> 15:05.125
-No!
-We're trapped!

15:08.833 --> 15:09.791
What happened?

15:09.875 --> 15:11.916
Oh no, milk and cookies!

15:12.000 --> 15:13.875
My only weakness.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.458
The Christmas cheer
powering this force field

15:18.541 --> 15:23.500
is more powerful than even you,
my ho-hoing chum, so you can't escape.

15:23.583 --> 15:27.416
And now to take my prize!

15:28.250 --> 15:29.583
No!

15:30.250 --> 15:34.291
Santa's cape!
Everything I ever wanted to take is here.

15:34.375 --> 15:38.875
-Wow, I guess Teddy really likes capes.
-He knows. But how?

15:38.958 --> 15:40.666
Allow me to explain.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.500
I have every toy
Hope Springs has to offer.

15:43.583 --> 15:48.791
What I don't have is every toy
from the North Pole, and I want them all!

15:48.875 --> 15:50.583
I tried taking some last year.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.875
<i>It was Christmas Eve.</i>

15:52.958 --> 15:58.291
<i>I placed my spy in the Action Academy,</i>
<i>where those heroes would get their gifts.</i>

15:58.375 --> 16:01.041
<i>That's when I saw</i>
<i>that the cape was the bag,</i>

16:01.125 --> 16:03.125
<i>and that the bag was a portal</i>

16:03.208 --> 16:06.375
<i>connected directly</i>
<i>to the North Pole Workshop.</i>

16:06.458 --> 16:07.833
Santa's Workshop,

16:07.916 --> 16:12.333
would you mind getting me a super snuggly
snuggle bug for Wren Reyes, please?

16:13.083 --> 16:17.916
<i>Any toy that the holder of the bag</i>
<i>asked for would appear in the bag.</i>

16:18.000 --> 16:20.291
<i>I wasn't able to take it last Christmas,</i>

16:20.375 --> 16:23.083
because I wasn't powerful enough
to trap Santa.

16:23.166 --> 16:25.333
That's where the Christmas cheer came in.

16:25.416 --> 16:28.791
Now every North Pole toy will be mine!

16:28.875 --> 16:33.000
Attention, Santa's Workshop,
I'll take a toy car.

16:34.291 --> 16:37.250
Yes, it worked! I'll take another car.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.416
And another car!

16:39.500 --> 16:40.583
And another!

16:40.666 --> 16:42.833
Boy, he really likes cars.

16:42.916 --> 16:45.875
I think we're going to need
more help than that, Striker.

16:45.958 --> 16:49.083
I can help. Action on, Polar Bear!

16:49.666 --> 16:50.583
Polar Bear!

16:51.083 --> 16:55.041
Oh no! I think the Cheer-Taker
messed with my animal powers.

16:55.125 --> 16:57.416
Mr Ernesto will be able to help us.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.125
Mr Ernesto, come in.

16:59.208 --> 17:02.666
Treena, what's wrong?
Is Santa okay? Can he hear me?

17:04.791 --> 17:07.250
Yes, he can hear you.
And no, we're not okay.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.125
We're trapped inside
a Christmas cheer-powered force field.

17:10.208 --> 17:13.250
Oh no! I'm scanning the design
through your insignia.

17:15.291 --> 17:18.333
And another car! And another!

17:18.416 --> 17:20.875
Got it.
If it works the way I think it does,

17:20.958 --> 17:23.000
the only way to deactivate the force field

17:23.083 --> 17:25.375
is to press the red button
on the power dock.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.041
Maybe I can reach it.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.916
Plasma Putty Stretch!

17:31.958 --> 17:33.416
It's too far,

17:33.500 --> 17:35.333
and I can't quite push it.

17:35.416 --> 17:40.125
If I could just change into a tiny mouse,
I could fit through!

17:40.208 --> 17:43.541
Action on, Tiny Mouse!

17:44.416 --> 17:49.125
Wren, you are one of the best
gift-givers I have ever met.

17:49.208 --> 17:53.625
I bet if you think of your powers
as a gift you can give to Hope Springs,

17:54.125 --> 17:55.583
you'll be able to do it.

17:55.666 --> 17:57.375
You're silly, Santa.

17:57.458 --> 18:01.125
It's not a gift. There's no way
to put it in a pretty box and wrap it.

18:02.375 --> 18:05.791
Gifts don't have to be things
you can hold in your hands.

18:05.875 --> 18:09.458
Some of the best gifts
are something you do for someone.

18:09.541 --> 18:10.500
Okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.208
Action on, Tiny Mouse!

18:13.833 --> 18:15.333
Tiny Mouse!

18:16.250 --> 18:18.875
A gift for Hope Springs.

18:19.708 --> 18:22.041
Action on, Tiny Mouse!

18:26.125 --> 18:27.250
It worked!

18:27.333 --> 18:29.666
-Plant-tastic!
-Hot Sparks!

18:29.750 --> 18:33.916
I'll shut off that battery
before you can say duck-billed platypus!

18:37.791 --> 18:40.208
Being itty-bitty is mega-biggie dangerous.

18:41.541 --> 18:45.750
Where did this bear come from?
And I can't go big, or Teddy will see me.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.125
Attention, Santa's Workshop.

18:48.208 --> 18:52.000
My dear Matthew has requested more bears.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.083
Bad car!

19:07.708 --> 19:09.458
Good car!

19:24.041 --> 19:25.541
-Yeah!
-Great job, Wren!

19:29.416 --> 19:31.083
Push!

19:31.166 --> 19:32.125
You!

19:32.750 --> 19:34.791
Action on, Sneaky Fox!

19:34.875 --> 19:37.708
Action on, Cheetah? Action on, anything?

19:38.541 --> 19:42.000
My animal powers aren't working again!
And I'm stuck as a mouse!

19:42.083 --> 19:43.541
Santa's Workshop,

19:43.625 --> 19:48.125
I need something that will take this
meddling rodent far away from that button.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.708
How about some Taker Tots?

19:53.583 --> 19:54.875
<i>-Take.</i>
<i>-Take.</i>

19:59.083 --> 20:00.041
Wren, look out!

20:00.833 --> 20:01.833
Oh no!

20:07.875 --> 20:09.750
<i>-Take!</i>
<i>-Take!</i>

20:14.166 --> 20:17.333
Wren, a gift for Hope Springs!

20:18.958 --> 20:21.333
This is my gift for Hope Springs.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.250
Action on,

20:24.125 --> 20:26.000
Polar Bear Arms!

20:29.125 --> 20:30.041
I did it!

20:30.125 --> 20:33.083
A gift for Hope Springs!

20:33.166 --> 20:37.166
They're going to be so happy and cheerful
and have a very merry Christmas!

20:38.166 --> 20:39.000
<i>Take!</i>

20:46.416 --> 20:48.291
Taker Tots, take them!

20:50.916 --> 20:52.416
-Action on!
-Action on!

20:54.041 --> 20:55.583
Invinci-ball!

21:04.291 --> 21:06.375
Get the Taker Tots in here!

21:06.458 --> 21:08.541
Flower Power!

21:12.083 --> 21:13.291
<i>Take?</i>

21:13.375 --> 21:14.291
Home run!

21:14.375 --> 21:15.208
<i>Take.</i>

21:17.583 --> 21:18.708
Strike!

21:22.458 --> 21:24.583
<i>-Take?</i>
<i>-</i>Slam dunk!

21:25.750 --> 21:27.041
Just let--

21:29.375 --> 21:30.708
<i>-Take.</i>
<i>-Take.</i>

21:30.791 --> 21:34.416
I'll be taking that
and all the toys you took.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.958
-Come along, toys.
-No! Not my toys!

21:38.833 --> 21:41.541
<i>Take.</i>

21:43.833 --> 21:44.750
<i>-Take.</i>
<i>-Take.</i>

21:44.833 --> 21:47.458
Hey, I took those fair and square!

21:47.541 --> 21:48.750
<i>Take.</i>

21:48.833 --> 21:52.916
That one didn't listen to you,
so it's mine. And you can't take it back.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Taker Tot, take them.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.125
<i>-Take?</i>
-No, wait!

21:58.291 --> 21:59.333
Hey!

21:59.416 --> 22:01.750
Matthew!

22:06.583 --> 22:09.458
It's time to restore Christmas cheer.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.708
Nothing like a quiet walk.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.208
Oh, look at that.

22:33.125 --> 22:33.958
Hot dog!

22:34.750 --> 22:37.375
<i>Dashing through the snow</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh…</i>

22:37.458 --> 22:39.791
No carolling!

22:39.875 --> 22:42.291
<i>O'er the fields we go…</i>

22:42.375 --> 22:46.708
They did it! The Action Pack and Santa
returned the Christmas cheer!

22:46.791 --> 22:51.583
Merry Christmas to you, Mr Ernesto.
And you too, Plunky.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.708
Christmas!

22:56.791 --> 23:00.708
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!</i>

23:00.791 --> 23:04.875
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

23:04.958 --> 23:05.958
<i>Oh, what fun…</i>

23:06.041 --> 23:09.333
Thank you for your help.
You did a jolly good job.

23:09.416 --> 23:11.375
But our mission isn't over yet.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.916
Yeah. We'd light up if it was.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.708
Well, we only finished the first part
of the mission to save Christmas.

23:17.791 --> 23:21.041
With all that hullabaloo,
I'm behind on my gift deliveries.

23:22.083 --> 23:25.458
Action Pack, would you like
to help me deliver the gifts?

23:25.541 --> 23:26.958
-Yes!
-That would be awesome!

23:27.041 --> 23:29.000
-I think I'd like that.
-I love giving!

23:29.083 --> 23:32.916
Mr Ernesto, can you help us
by mapping the fastest route?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.500
One step ahead of you.

23:34.583 --> 23:37.500
Plunky and I have already planned out
the perfect delivery route

23:37.583 --> 23:40.166
so you can get all the presents
out on time.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.750
Excellent Mission Controlling, you two.

23:42.833 --> 23:45.958
But it's not Christmas
until we light the tree.

23:46.041 --> 23:47.791
Hot Sparks! That's my cue!

23:53.791 --> 23:54.791
Happy holidays!

23:54.875 --> 23:56.250
Feliz Navidad!

23:56.333 --> 23:58.458
-Merry Christmas!
-Happy Christmas!
