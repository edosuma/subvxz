01:02.851 --> 01:04.671
<i>So, Rosie honey,
are you excited</i>

01:04.694 --> 01:06.361
about spending the whole
summer with us?

01:06.430 --> 01:08.630
Yes, ma'am. Mom told me
about all the cool things

01:08.666 --> 01:12.668
there are to do, like fishing.
And the festival.

01:12.703 --> 01:15.455
Don't forget, that Red Rock
summer camp is coming up very soon.

01:15.556 --> 01:19.608
That'd be a great opportunity for you
to make some new friends.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.644
Whatever happens, it's going
to be an amazing summer.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.680
Wait and see.
Look, honey.

01:58.883 --> 02:01.476
I told her it doesn't really matter
whether I have to go dead.

02:01.477 --> 02:02.518
I don't think so!

02:02.553 --> 02:03.553
Surprise!

02:05.556 --> 02:08.690
That's ama... Thank you!

02:08.726 --> 02:10.324
You didn't have to do all that!

02:10.360 --> 02:13.729
- Don't be silly, sweetheart.
- Welcome home, Tyler. Come on!

02:13.764 --> 02:14.730
George!

02:15.199 --> 02:17.166
We missed you.

02:18.146 --> 02:20.330
Look at you, Rosie.
You've grown.

02:20.365 --> 02:22.504
You were just a baby
when I saw you last time.

02:22.992 --> 02:25.064
- I am George.
- Hi.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.976
- Are you hungry, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.711
How about I fix you a nice,
big stack of blueberry pancakes?

02:29.780 --> 02:31.013
Yes, please.

02:31.361 --> 02:34.253
- She's huge!
- I know. She's so big now.

02:35.787 --> 02:38.620
And you're probably wondering
where Eddie is.

02:38.656 --> 02:40.206
Actually, Jo already told us,

02:40.207 --> 02:42.157
and I figured you wouldn't
want to talk about it.

02:42.193 --> 02:46.094
That's sweet, but honestly,
the divorce was final

02:46.130 --> 02:49.498
over two years ago, and Eddie
and I just realized

02:49.567 --> 02:52.467
we're better as friends than
we were as husband and wife.

02:52.503 --> 02:55.638
I know the feeling. I made
two friends the exact same way.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.273
How long are you
and Rosie staying?

02:58.309 --> 02:59.309
The whole summer.

02:59.377 --> 03:01.421
Rosie really wanted to spend
her birthday here,

03:01.445 --> 03:04.613
and guess I needed
a bit of a breather.

03:04.648 --> 03:07.249
I'll bet you're nice
and busy at the big,

03:07.284 --> 03:09.451
fancy restaurant
out in San Francisco.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.062
Yup. Yeah, pretty busy.

03:12.857 --> 03:14.256
It's so good to be back here,
though.

03:14.292 --> 03:17.036
- Everything looks exactly the same.
- We don't like change.

03:17.422 --> 03:20.169
Any chance you guys have
an extra apron in the back?

03:20.291 --> 03:23.002
You know, your mama hangs
your apron in the same spot.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.199
Of course she does.

03:25.263 --> 03:27.067
<i>...sugar.
Now, your mom was telling me</i>

03:27.068 --> 03:30.272
<i>that you have got a teacher
that you really, really like.</i>

03:30.341 --> 03:32.174
What, what are you doing?

03:32.209 --> 03:34.009
I thought I'd help
with the lunch rush.

03:34.044 --> 03:35.856
You've been in town
less than thirty minutes,

03:35.880 --> 03:38.347
and you already want
to get back to work?

03:38.382 --> 03:41.149
Yup.
Some things never change.

03:42.887 --> 03:46.544
No! My CD player!
You still have this?

03:49.081 --> 03:50.959
It's right where I left it.

03:55.629 --> 03:57.866
This was my favorite!

04:03.374 --> 04:06.275
No I can't dance!
I cannot dance!

04:22.059 --> 04:25.093
Okay, so just give them some of
that Texas charm, and you'll be done.

04:25.129 --> 04:26.428
Let's do it.

04:27.865 --> 04:31.099
Alright, alright! Can I get
everyone's attention?

04:31.982 --> 04:35.444
I have to get on out of here
before Corey finds out I'm a vegetarian.

04:36.707 --> 04:39.019
As you all know, we're here
celebrating the release

04:39.043 --> 04:42.844
of Corey's newest cookbook,
"Tales of a Texas Pit Master",

04:42.880 --> 04:45.180
which - and I haven't even
told him this yet -

04:45.215 --> 04:49.384
just reached enough advance sales
to make it his third best seller!

04:53.891 --> 04:56.525
Hey, that's all you guys.
No, no, that's, that's you guys.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.594
In the ten years since he arrived
from a little town in central Texas,

04:59.629 --> 05:03.129
Corey's built a barbecue empire
that includes his books,

05:03.135 --> 05:06.201
a product line, and three
restaurants he's opened.

05:06.236 --> 05:08.904
So, let's give it up
for Corey Turner!

05:13.444 --> 05:16.111
You know, for a vegetarian,
she sure eats a lot of ribs.

05:18.048 --> 05:21.316
No. Listen, I do want
to say a special thank you

05:21.352 --> 05:24.019
to my manager, Sofia Johnson.

05:24.054 --> 05:27.376
<i>She has single-handedly
helped me achieve all my dreams,</i>

05:27.411 --> 05:28.957
...and I will be forever grateful.

05:31.128 --> 05:33.295
So, thank you guys
for taking your lunch

05:33.330 --> 05:36.098
and coming here
to help us celebrate.

05:36.133 --> 05:40.335
It's been an amazing,
and exhausting journey.

05:40.404 --> 05:43.138
One of my favorite quotes
is from the late journalist,

05:43.173 --> 05:45.107
named Harriet Von Horne,
who said,

05:45.142 --> 05:48.076
"Cooking is a lot like love.
It should be entered into...

05:48.112 --> 05:50.196
...with abandon, or not at all".

05:50.197 --> 05:54.024
Well, I have entered into
all of this with abandon,

05:54.025 --> 05:56.651
but I've done it
with each of you at my side.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.922
I love you guys, and thank you,
and go eat some more brisket.

06:01.877 --> 06:03.591
Baby backs and mac are up.

06:09.211 --> 06:11.177
Hey, Tyler, come here a sec.

06:13.487 --> 06:16.119
- Tell me what you think.
- Okay.

06:18.842 --> 06:22.544
Maybe a pinch more
butter and chive.

06:22.612 --> 06:24.512
I think you may be right.

06:24.548 --> 06:25.848
It's good to have you
back in the kitchen.

06:25.895 --> 06:27.706
It feels good to be back.

06:27.707 --> 06:31.720
George, it seems slow
for lunch. What gives?

06:31.755 --> 06:33.889
Well, I hadn't really noticed.

06:35.325 --> 06:37.859
George? You've worked here
for twenty years.

06:37.895 --> 06:43.031
- You notice everything.
- Probably just a slow day.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.267
Okay, you're not fooling me.
Give it up.

06:45.302 --> 06:49.638
Okay, but you did not hear this
from me.

06:53.177 --> 06:55.243
It's been slow
like this for a while.

06:55.279 --> 06:58.057
Two new, flashier barbecue restaurants
opened up in town this past year,

06:58.092 --> 07:00.199
and they've pulled
a lot of our business away.

07:00.914 --> 07:04.125
Your mama won't say anything,
but she's worried.

07:04.321 --> 07:05.854
So are we all.

07:07.424 --> 07:09.758
I'll go check on the smoker.

07:09.793 --> 07:10.826
Okay.

07:15.599 --> 07:16.731
What you drawing, ladybug?

07:21.772 --> 07:24.072
That's really good!
It's a keeper.

07:24.108 --> 07:25.740
Thank you.

07:25.776 --> 07:29.497
So, your grandma said they still have
some spots left at that summer camp.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.914
Think you might want to try it?
It's just for two weeks.

07:32.950 --> 07:36.017
What if I go,
and no one likes me?

07:36.053 --> 07:38.164
What are you talking about?
Why wouldn't they like you?

07:38.188 --> 07:41.523
You're smart and funny.
Of course they're going to love you!

07:41.558 --> 07:43.636
You just have to say those
things because you're my mom.

07:43.660 --> 07:46.361
No, I have to say them
because they're true.

07:49.066 --> 07:53.735
Alright. Well, the meat's cooked,
but the Staubach just quit on us.

07:56.006 --> 07:57.506
There we go.

07:58.575 --> 08:00.742
So, Staubach is the smoker?

08:00.811 --> 08:05.747
Yup. Named after your grandfather's
favorite Dallas Cowboy, Roger Staubach.

08:05.782 --> 08:07.816
And the backbone of this place.

08:07.851 --> 08:09.918
Ray always used to say,
"Without the right smoker,

08:09.953 --> 08:11.464
your barbecue ain't
going to be right".

08:11.488 --> 08:14.405
So, we got him back, but
how long has he been on the fritz?

08:14.558 --> 08:16.291
A little while now.

08:16.326 --> 08:19.060
Seems like something new breaks
down every day around here.

08:19.095 --> 08:21.630
- I heard that!
- Heard what?

08:22.632 --> 08:24.098
Rosie, come help me
in the kitchen.

08:24.134 --> 08:25.233
Okay!

08:26.603 --> 08:29.938
Mom, how come
you haven't said anything?

08:29.973 --> 08:32.573
Oh, honey.
There's nothing to say.

08:32.609 --> 08:36.443
Oh, come on. The smoker, the
broken appliances, fewer customers?

08:36.480 --> 08:40.381
It's, it's nothing. Trust me.
We're going to be fine.

08:40.417 --> 08:42.350
Things work themselves out.
Now, come on.

08:42.385 --> 08:44.419
We've got hungry mouths to feed.

08:49.726 --> 08:51.926
And that's done.

08:51.995 --> 08:54.195
Okay. So, admit it.
You had fun.

08:54.231 --> 08:56.197
Of course I did.
I always have fun.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.073
It's true. You definitely
have more energy than

08:58.101 --> 09:00.001
any of my other clients.
That's for sure.

09:00.036 --> 09:03.355
And you're going to need it for the
meeting with the network tomorrow.

09:03.356 --> 09:05.508
I think they're going to
make you an offer.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.975
Wait.
You set that for tomorrow?

09:07.010 --> 09:08.977
Don't tell me you forgot.

09:09.012 --> 09:11.412
No, I didn't forget.
Maybe you forgot.

09:11.481 --> 09:12.714
I'm flying to Texas tomorrow.

09:12.782 --> 09:16.066
Corey, this is the network. All the
top executives are going to be there.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.152
What can possibly be
more important than this?

09:18.188 --> 09:20.321
I know, I know. I just know
that we talked about this.

09:20.357 --> 09:23.531
I'm supposed to be on a plane
first thing in the morning to Texas.

09:23.627 --> 09:25.972
No, you said you were thinking
about going to Texas.

09:25.996 --> 09:27.402
There's a difference.

09:27.831 --> 09:28.963
I promised Jay.

09:28.999 --> 09:31.666
- And who is Jay again?
- My best friend from high school.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.102
Let me get this straight.
You're putting Jay, from high school,

09:34.103 --> 09:36.638
over a national TV show
that could change your life?

09:36.673 --> 09:38.740
Look. I promised him
that I would go back

09:38.775 --> 09:41.024
to our hometown's annual
barbecue cook off.

09:41.111 --> 09:42.013
Corey.

09:42.046 --> 09:44.173
Attendance is down.
He thought I could help him out.

09:44.247 --> 09:46.581
I am sure he'll understand
that this is the priority,

09:46.616 --> 09:48.950
and you have to back out.

09:49.753 --> 09:53.170
You know what? Where I'm from,
when you make a promise, you keep it.

09:53.205 --> 09:56.466
I'm sure that you can use
your magic with the network,

09:56.467 --> 09:58.927
and they'll be happy
to reschedule for later.

10:00.864 --> 10:02.031
Fine.

10:02.052 --> 10:04.244
I'll buy us some time.
Just please get back here ASAP.

10:04.246 --> 10:06.440
You're not the only chef
who wants a TV show.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.636
Thank you.

10:45.026 --> 10:47.462
<i>I'm telling you, man.
It is so good to have you back, buddy.</i>

10:47.497 --> 10:50.145
<i>It's been like fifteen years
since you moved out to New York?</i>

10:50.180 --> 10:51.991
<i>Yeah, something like that.</i>

10:52.015 --> 10:54.078
Well, I've got to tell you,
I really appreciate all those times

10:54.079 --> 10:56.017
that you hosted me and Karen
out there.

10:56.086 --> 10:58.853
That loft of yours is amazing.

10:59.656 --> 11:01.456
Hey, whatever happened
with that? Huh?

11:01.491 --> 11:03.424
You guys were together
seven years.

11:03.460 --> 11:04.692
I never got that far.

11:04.761 --> 11:08.863
Yeah, I know. It's just, when she got
that job out in Chicago, I just couldn't...

11:08.965 --> 11:12.167
I didn't have it in me to move.
Red Rock is where I belong.

11:12.202 --> 11:13.802
I get it.

11:14.104 --> 11:15.970
This place's changed some, huh?

11:16.006 --> 11:17.672
Yeah, but it still
feels like home.

11:18.442 --> 11:20.442
- This you?
- Yup, this is us.

11:24.314 --> 11:27.293
- This is yours?
- It's just a little renter I own.

11:27.317 --> 11:29.429
Nobody's here right now.
I figure it's the perfect place

11:29.453 --> 11:30.885
for you while you're in town.

11:30.921 --> 11:33.455
I mean, gas range,
smoker out there.

11:33.790 --> 11:34.942
Not bad, huh?

11:34.943 --> 11:39.894
And I have got you
a fully stocked fridge.

11:39.929 --> 11:41.195
Nice.

11:41.231 --> 11:44.431
See? I know how to treat
my celebrity guest.

11:44.466 --> 11:45.701
Stop it.

11:46.503 --> 11:49.070
Listen, thank you again
for coming out.

11:49.105 --> 11:51.372
Really, I mean it.
It means so much to everyone.

11:51.408 --> 11:55.176
And your name alone is going to
seriously boost our attendance this year.

11:55.211 --> 11:56.711
I don't know about that.

11:56.746 --> 11:59.380
And I don't know who would put you
in charge of this festival.

11:59.895 --> 12:01.861
I mean, did they not know you
in high school?

12:01.885 --> 12:04.231
What are you talking about?
I was a good high school student.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.921
- Jay.
- When I showed up.

12:06.006 --> 12:09.969
Right. And now you're a teacher.
And a real estate mogul, apparently.

12:10.326 --> 12:12.444
- What is the world coming to?
- Well, don't worry.

12:12.445 --> 12:14.087
I am not going to challenge your status

12:14.088 --> 12:16.725
as Red Rock's most
notable son anytime soon.

12:17.534 --> 12:19.401
I'm going to make an omelet.
Do you want one?

12:19.469 --> 12:20.786
I'd love to, but I've got to go.

12:20.787 --> 12:22.738
I'm volunteering at
the town summer camp.

12:22.806 --> 12:24.639
You're what?
You're volunteering?

12:24.674 --> 12:27.475
Come on! Who are you?
Thank you, man.

12:27.511 --> 12:29.477
- See you soon.
- Appreciate you.

12:36.586 --> 12:38.876
<i>And there's still time
for anyone who wants to enter</i>

12:38.877 --> 12:42.090
<i>the annual Red Rock Barbecue
Cook Off, but you'd better hurry!</i>

12:42.125 --> 12:45.560
- Something smells good in here.
- Good morning.

12:45.595 --> 12:48.896
Good morning. So, are you thinking
of signing up for that cook off?

12:48.932 --> 12:51.699
- Probably not.
- Well, why not?

12:51.735 --> 12:54.068
I saw you in the restaurant
yesterday.

12:54.104 --> 12:55.703
Didn't miss a beat.

12:55.739 --> 12:59.340
I don't know. The contest was always
your and Daddy's thing, not mine.

12:59.375 --> 13:02.910
Sure. I'm just saying it could
be your thing, too if you wanted.

13:02.946 --> 13:06.781
I don't know. I think I'll stick
with French cuisine.

13:06.850 --> 13:11.219
Whatever makes you happy, hon.
That's all I care about.

13:13.056 --> 13:16.224
I forgot. I saw one of Corey's
cookbooks in the kitchen.

13:17.694 --> 13:19.538
I thought that was really nice,
what he wrote to you.

13:19.562 --> 13:22.630
- Yeah, wasn't that sweet of him?
- Who's Corey?

13:22.665 --> 13:27.568
Good morning.
Corey is... was...

13:27.637 --> 13:30.638
Corey is your mom's good friend.

13:30.673 --> 13:33.374
Here you go, sweetie.

13:34.177 --> 13:36.477
When Dad and I FaceTimed
last night, he said he might

13:36.513 --> 13:38.312
try to fly in for my birthday.

13:38.348 --> 13:39.847
That would be great.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.483
Why are you wearing a backpack?

13:42.519 --> 13:44.986
Well, I was thinking
I might want to go

13:45.021 --> 13:47.989
to summer camp today,
if you're okay with it.

13:48.258 --> 13:51.826
Of course I'm okay with it.
I think that's a great idea.

13:52.462 --> 13:54.529
Why don't you
eat your breakfast,

13:54.597 --> 13:56.964
and then I'll drive you
over to camp?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.833
Thank you.

13:58.902 --> 14:01.803
Okay, gather round, everyone!
Please, gather round.

14:02.172 --> 14:05.940
<i>Welcome to this year's
Red Rock Summer Camp!</i>

14:07.944 --> 14:10.428
Yeah! Now, over the next two weeks,

14:10.429 --> 14:15.250
we want all of you to try as
many new experiences as you can.

14:15.318 --> 14:19.649
Whether that's a dance class,
or a nature hike, or horseback riding.

14:19.684 --> 14:24.092
The goal here is for you to have
the best summer of your life!

14:25.428 --> 14:29.139
Alright, before we start,
I'm going to ask you for a favor.

14:29.174 --> 14:33.201
I would like you
to help us tell everyone

14:33.236 --> 14:36.371
about the Red Rock
Barbecue Cook Off and Festival

14:36.406 --> 14:39.440
by handing out these flyers
after camp, alright?

14:39.776 --> 14:40.942
You, there.

14:42.212 --> 14:44.146
- Hand these out?
- Sure.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.047
- There you go.
- Okay.

14:47.517 --> 14:49.183
And here's some for you.

14:49.753 --> 14:52.053
Alright, before we get on
to our first activity,

14:52.088 --> 14:53.488
I'm going to give you
an assignment.

14:55.258 --> 14:58.192
Don't worry! It's not homework,
I promise!

14:58.228 --> 15:02.834
I just want you to start documenting
your camp experience.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.513
And that could be anything
that you want.

15:04.548 --> 15:07.314
It could be taking photos,
drawing pictures,

15:07.349 --> 15:09.894
anything that is going to
tell the story of your summer.

15:09.895 --> 15:12.040
And it's not due until
the very end of camp.

15:12.075 --> 15:14.208
Now, let's split up into threes,
and let's go!

15:18.815 --> 15:21.182
Do you want to come join us
for the treasure hunt?

15:21.217 --> 15:22.217
Sure!

15:25.956 --> 15:29.465
Tyler, you should be outside
enjoying this beautiful summer's day.

15:29.593 --> 15:32.160
I am enjoying it, by cooking
in your kitchen again.

15:32.195 --> 15:36.164
I'm very glad to have you around,
so I'm not going to complain.

15:38.401 --> 15:43.137
Do you think that Eddie's actually
going to get here for Rosie's birthday?

15:43.173 --> 15:46.574
I don't know. He's got a lot
on his plate right now.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.509
I don't want Rosie
to get her hopes up.

15:48.578 --> 15:49.922
Everything alright
with his business?

15:49.946 --> 15:52.280
Yeah. Yeah, it's...

15:53.450 --> 15:54.782
What?

15:54.818 --> 15:57.752
I didn't want you to worry,
so I didn't say anything,

15:57.787 --> 15:59.754
but Eddie and the other
investors decided to close

15:59.789 --> 16:04.592
the San Francisco restaurant.
So, I am currently out of a job.

16:04.628 --> 16:06.427
What happened?

16:06.763 --> 16:09.748
You know how it is. At first
you're the hottest place in town,

16:09.783 --> 16:11.766
until something new opens up.

16:11.834 --> 16:15.870
- Honey. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

16:15.905 --> 16:18.139
When I get back, I'll line up
some interviews,

16:18.174 --> 16:20.174
and my savings will get us
through until then.

16:20.209 --> 16:23.262
- You sure you'll be okay?
- Yes, I will be fine.

16:23.263 --> 16:28.049
Honestly, I could use the break,
and maybe it's for the best.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.231
They didn't seem like
they were going to offer me...

16:30.232 --> 16:32.241
...the head chef position
anytime soon.

16:32.422 --> 16:33.855
Couldn't Eddie have
said something?

16:33.890 --> 16:35.807
No, I didn't want him to do that.

16:35.808 --> 16:38.984
I only wanted to move up
if it was because of my skill.

16:39.129 --> 16:40.495
Good for you.

16:52.609 --> 16:53.909
Hey there, ladybug.

16:53.910 --> 16:56.640
I can't believe I barely
had time to talk to you

16:56.641 --> 16:58.312
since you got back from camp.

16:58.348 --> 17:01.016
- How was it?
- It was really fun.

17:01.017 --> 17:03.451
I think I even made
some new friends.

17:03.486 --> 17:08.656
- That is great.
- And you should enter this.

17:10.894 --> 17:12.711
I don't know.

17:12.712 --> 17:15.896
I don't exactly look like
your every day barbecue chef.

17:15.932 --> 17:20.367
Mom, I'm not kidding.
You could totally win this.

17:20.403 --> 17:23.871
Well, thank you for
the vote of confidence.

17:24.906 --> 17:26.707
Lights out in ten.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.623
Do you remember that day?

17:42.659 --> 17:44.992
One of many wins
for you and Daddy.

17:46.663 --> 17:49.897
I'm going to enter
the contest this year.

17:49.933 --> 17:54.068
What? Really? Honey!
Why the change of heart?

17:54.137 --> 17:56.738
Well, $25,000 would
really help around here.

17:56.806 --> 18:00.298
Think about it. New appliances,
new parts for the smoker,

18:00.333 --> 18:02.009
and being in the contest
is going to bring in

18:02.045 --> 18:03.811
a lot of free advertising
for the restaurant.

18:03.847 --> 18:05.847
Tyler, honey, that's very sweet
of you, but...

18:05.882 --> 18:09.851
Mom, don't be so stubborn.
I want to help you.

18:11.154 --> 18:13.554
- Alright.
- Okay.

18:13.623 --> 18:14.623
Alright, sweetie.

18:16.526 --> 18:18.292
Besides, I'm doing this
for me, too.

18:18.628 --> 18:21.730
I want to show Rosie that
sometimes taking risks is important,

18:21.765 --> 18:24.131
and you'll never win
unless you try.

18:25.635 --> 18:27.001
That is my girl.

18:34.377 --> 18:36.444
- Jay?
- Tyler!

18:36.479 --> 18:39.880
I can't believe it!
It's so good to see you!

18:39.916 --> 18:43.050
It's good to see you, too!
It's been a while.

18:43.086 --> 18:44.552
Yeah. What are you doing here?

18:44.587 --> 18:48.389
They said this is where to sign up
for the contest, so here I am.

18:48.424 --> 18:52.160
Well, this is it. Actually, I'm in charge
of running the festival this year.

18:52.237 --> 18:54.378
Can you believe that?
Of course you can!

18:55.098 --> 18:56.514
It's so good to see you.

18:56.515 --> 18:58.333
I'm so glad you're going to be
competing in the cook off.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.847
- Yeah, me too.
- And I don't know if you heard...

19:00.870 --> 19:03.571
...but we announced the
participation of a celebrity chef.

19:03.918 --> 19:07.395
He's going to be joining us all week,
and taking part in the cook off finale.

19:07.430 --> 19:11.918
- That's exciting! Who is it?
- Actually, I think you know him.

19:26.196 --> 19:29.508
Is it me, or does it feel like
we just saw each other yesterday?

19:29.532 --> 19:31.465
I was just thinking
the same thing!

19:31.501 --> 19:34.902
I know! I mean, probably because
we haven't aged at all.

19:34.971 --> 19:36.871
So true. No, we look
exactly the same.

19:36.940 --> 19:37.940
Exactly.

19:38.475 --> 19:40.775
Seriously, Corey,
you did so well for yourself.

19:40.811 --> 19:43.044
The cookbooks,
and the restaurant,

19:43.079 --> 19:46.047
and I think I might even own
one of your spatulas.

19:46.082 --> 19:47.015
That's embarrassing.

19:47.050 --> 19:48.483
No!
Are you kidding?

19:48.518 --> 19:50.852
Do you know what I'd give
for a product line?

19:50.887 --> 19:51.820
Well, it has paid some bills.

19:51.852 --> 19:54.723
I bet. And I'm sure your parents
are very proud.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.737
Speaking of your parents,
how are they?

19:58.061 --> 20:00.128
They're great. They retired
to Coco Beach.

20:02.366 --> 20:04.366
What about you, huh?
How have you been?

20:04.401 --> 20:05.967
Hey, I heard you have
a daughter.

20:06.003 --> 20:08.169
I do.
I do. Her name's Rosie.

20:08.205 --> 20:09.304
That's great.

20:09.339 --> 20:11.373
Let me guess who your source is.
My mom?

20:11.408 --> 20:12.408
Your mom, yeah.

20:13.177 --> 20:15.677
And full disclosure,
I Googled you.

20:15.712 --> 20:16.712
Really?

20:18.182 --> 20:22.017
Probably once.
Really?

20:24.555 --> 20:28.823
Well, something you might not know
about me is I'm divorced.

20:29.159 --> 20:30.559
Nope, knew that, too.

20:30.594 --> 20:33.161
- My mom.
- Your mom.

20:33.297 --> 20:35.163
How was that?
I bet that was hard.

20:35.532 --> 20:38.566
You know, it was actually
very friendly.

20:38.602 --> 20:39.901
Good.

20:39.936 --> 20:41.748
We just really wanted to keep
everything normal for Rosie,

20:41.772 --> 20:43.405
so that became
the most important thing.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.806
Yeah, of course.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.308
I almost forgot.
I saw one of your cookbooks...

20:47.378 --> 20:52.794
...at my mom's house.
It was Life is a BBQ.

20:52.949 --> 20:56.351
And I wanted to thank you
for what you wrote about my mom.

20:56.386 --> 20:58.820
Look, I meant it.
It's the truth.

20:58.855 --> 21:02.023
Everything I learned, I learned
from them in that restaurant.

21:03.693 --> 21:06.161
How long are you in town for?

21:06.196 --> 21:09.597
I'm going to have to go back to New York
right after the competition.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.433
Figured.

21:13.136 --> 21:15.270
I should head back to
the restaurant.

21:15.305 --> 21:16.504
Yeah. Yeah.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.239
It was really nice
seeing you again.

21:18.275 --> 21:19.718
You, too.

21:19.850 --> 21:22.077
Maybe we can
see each other again.

21:22.112 --> 21:23.362
Maybe.

21:27.117 --> 21:28.983
You look great, Tyler.

21:47.968 --> 21:50.605
Isn't it great to see
Corey back in town again?

21:50.674 --> 21:53.007
Yeah, it's been a long time.

21:53.076 --> 21:55.477
Have you been able
to catch up with him at all?

21:55.512 --> 21:59.914
I actually saw him at the
sign up for the cook offs.

21:59.950 --> 22:03.451
It was amazing to see how he hasn't
changed with all that success.

22:03.487 --> 22:06.788
You know, I know you were
both young, but I always thought

22:06.823 --> 22:08.957
that you two were going
to end up together.

22:08.992 --> 22:14.295
Yeah. I think we were
just too much alike.

22:14.331 --> 22:16.030
You know, we were
two headstrong kids

22:16.066 --> 22:18.566
who wanted to take the world
by storm, and...

22:18.602 --> 22:20.201
- Oh, honey.
- Thank you.

22:20.237 --> 22:21.603
You never told me that before.

22:21.938 --> 22:23.071
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

22:24.174 --> 22:26.374
Yeah, well, I bet
you had a hunch.

22:26.409 --> 22:29.377
Well, maybe.

22:30.046 --> 22:32.580
I'm just glad that the
two of you are going to be

22:32.649 --> 22:34.816
cooking together again.
You know, like the old days.

22:34.851 --> 22:36.484
We're not going to be
cooking together.

22:36.519 --> 22:38.886
Even if I do make it
into the final round,

22:38.955 --> 22:40.848
we're going to be competing
against each other.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.151
Thank you.

22:42.397 --> 22:46.647
I'm just saying, it's nice that you're going
to be spending some time together again.

22:47.363 --> 22:50.298
He's single right now, isn't he?

22:50.333 --> 22:51.365
Ma.

22:51.434 --> 22:54.969
Okay, fine.
I won't say another word.

22:55.004 --> 22:57.171
What do I know, anyway?
I'm just your mother.

22:59.342 --> 23:01.543
Yeah, good. Don't put the holes
too close together.

23:01.578 --> 23:03.811
Okay. Why?

23:03.880 --> 23:05.914
Well, we puncture the meat
to let it breathe

23:05.949 --> 23:07.415
while it's cooking.

23:07.450 --> 23:08.783
That's silly.

23:08.818 --> 23:13.121
It kind of is,
but it's also very important.

23:13.189 --> 23:14.889
Ladybug, can you
grab me a tomato?

23:14.925 --> 23:16.391
Sure.

23:21.765 --> 23:24.365
Hey, Mom, do you think
we can try one of the recipes

23:24.401 --> 23:25.767
from your friend
Corey's cookbook?

23:28.738 --> 23:30.438
Grandma, are you okay?

23:30.507 --> 23:32.206
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm fine, yeah.

23:33.677 --> 23:36.911
Grandma just needs to be a little
more careful next time, right, Grandma?

23:36.980 --> 23:40.648
Why don't we put this away so
we can focus on what we're making?

23:42.319 --> 23:43.351
Go check your dish.

23:43.586 --> 23:44.586
Okay.

24:18.221 --> 24:20.188
No, no. Staubach,
don't quit on me now.

24:28.131 --> 24:30.031
Okay.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.537
Alright. Okay.

24:44.458 --> 24:48.249
Just give me till the end
of the competition, okay, Big Guy?

24:58.061 --> 24:59.627
Hi, Eddie.

24:59.663 --> 25:02.997
<i>Hey! Just wanted to touch base,
and see how you're holding up.</i>

25:03.066 --> 25:04.277
It's been really nice
being back in Red Rock.

25:04.301 --> 25:07.068
I even entered
the barbecue contest.

25:07.103 --> 25:11.139
That's great! You're back behind
a smoker again! Fantastic!

25:11.207 --> 25:13.141
It only took fifteen years.

25:13.869 --> 25:14.943
How's Rosie?

25:14.978 --> 25:17.211
She's good. She's spending
the day with my mom.

25:17.247 --> 25:19.714
Do you think you're going
to make it for her birthday?

25:19.749 --> 25:22.917
I hope so, but I'm about to
catch a flight to San Diego.

25:22.953 --> 25:24.886
We've got a new place opening up
this weekend.

25:24.921 --> 25:26.254
The manager just quit, so...

25:26.289 --> 25:29.023
Right, right. But it would mean
a lot to her, so I...

25:29.359 --> 25:31.826
<i>Final boarding call
for Flight 342 to San Diego.</i>

25:31.861 --> 25:34.128
Yeah, I'll do my best,
but I've got to go.

25:34.163 --> 25:35.863
Tell Rosie I'll call her
tonight. Bye.

25:38.568 --> 25:40.134
Bye.

25:40.637 --> 25:41.637
Hello again.

25:43.506 --> 25:45.073
Hello.

25:48.078 --> 25:51.346
Well, how are you
on this fine Texas morning?

25:51.381 --> 25:53.781
Fine. I'm just running
some errands.

25:53.817 --> 25:55.049
Yeah? Anything
I can help with?

25:55.118 --> 25:56.718
No, I got it.

25:56.786 --> 25:58.453
I'm sure you do.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.590
- I remember that.
- What?

26:02.626 --> 26:05.460
That disarming smile of yours.

26:05.495 --> 26:09.964
No that was my charming smile.
This is my disarming smile.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Okay, okay.

26:13.904 --> 26:15.937
Do you want
to grab dinner later?

26:15.972 --> 26:18.940
I don't think
that's a good idea.

26:19.843 --> 26:21.609
I mean, we're competitors now.

26:21.645 --> 26:24.479
Right, right. I mean,
but really are we?

26:24.514 --> 26:26.394
Because I'm just competing
against the finalist.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.082
Well, we don't know.

26:28.118 --> 26:30.718
Okay! So, you don't think
I'm going to make it into the finals.

26:30.754 --> 26:31.964
I don't know.
French cuisine?

26:31.988 --> 26:34.322
You might be a little rusty
back there.

26:34.391 --> 26:38.026
I will have you know that I will be
competing against you in the finals.

26:38.061 --> 26:39.727
And therefore, we need
to act accordingly.

26:39.763 --> 26:43.231
And so I can't afford
any distractions.

26:45.876 --> 26:49.437
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
and a special welcome to the contestants.</i>

26:49.472 --> 26:51.505
We are thrilled
to have you here!

26:54.043 --> 26:56.043
Alright!

26:56.079 --> 26:59.499
Now, this year's cook off will take
place over the course of a week,

26:59.534 --> 27:04.228
leading to our grand finale,
which will close out our festival.

27:04.521 --> 27:07.388
Now, the first round is going
to be an on-site cook off,

27:07.424 --> 27:11.680
and the menu will consist of chicken,
plus one side of your choice.

27:12.127 --> 27:14.996
Your meals will be evaluated
by our esteemed judges.

27:20.670 --> 27:23.771
After which they will eliminate
six contestants.

27:23.807 --> 27:26.307
Four will remain
for the semi-final.

27:26.342 --> 27:29.377
After the semi-finals,
only one contestant

27:29.446 --> 27:33.981
will be selected to participate
in the grand finale,

27:34.017 --> 27:37.452
where they will face off
against our own celebrity chef,

27:37.487 --> 27:39.020
Red Rock's Corey Turner.

27:43.693 --> 27:46.127
And there, a champion
will be crowned,

27:46.162 --> 27:47.562
and good luck to you all!

27:55.505 --> 27:57.739
Chef Corey, can I ask you
some questions?

27:57.774 --> 27:58.774
Yes, of course.

27:58.808 --> 28:00.575
How does it feel
being back home again?

28:00.910 --> 28:04.635
I love Red Rock. Being here
kind of feels like I never left.

28:04.781 --> 28:06.614
Excuse me, one sec.
Hey.

28:06.649 --> 28:09.550
Let me know if you change
your mind about dinner.

28:09.586 --> 28:11.886
Don't think that smile
is going to change my mind,

28:11.921 --> 28:15.723
or help you win this contest,
either, Mister Turner.

28:15.759 --> 28:19.160
Well, okay then.
Let the games begin.

28:22.232 --> 28:23.232
Sorry about that.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.510
What's going on in here?

28:33.545 --> 28:35.746
Mom is testing a new sauce
for the competition.

28:35.814 --> 28:39.102
I figured since people are starting
to come into town for the festival,

28:39.137 --> 28:41.812
we could set up
a sampling tray out in front,

28:41.813 --> 28:43.887
and drum up
some new business.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.056
And get people excited
about the restaurant!

28:46.125 --> 28:47.658
I love that idea.

28:47.685 --> 28:51.728
Anything that gets
new customers in is okay with me.

28:53.308 --> 28:54.965
That is delicious, Tyler.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.668
Good. Then take this tray.
I'm putting you to work.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.102
Alright.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.044
Sofia, hey. How are you?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.981
Do you realize this is the first time
we've talked since you left?

29:11.017 --> 29:13.250
No, I know. I know.
It's just been slammed,

29:13.285 --> 29:17.754
and they've got a couple of more
things scheduled for me, and then...

29:18.090 --> 29:20.924
You know, hey, listen. Maybe
we can just do a video conference.

29:20.959 --> 29:24.227
No, we can't do a video conference.
They need to see you in person.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.440
And Corey,
they're losing patience.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.596
I can't stall them forever.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.231
I know. I know. Sorry.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.886
Best barbecue in Red Rock!

29:29.887 --> 29:32.936
Come and get your free samples,
and come on in!

29:32.971 --> 29:35.050
Hey, listen. I'm going to call
you back, okay? Alright.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.707
I'm not...

29:36.742 --> 29:37.941
Finished!

29:39.912 --> 29:42.946
- Excuse me, are these for anyone?
- Why, yes they are!

29:43.015 --> 29:45.782
- It's great to see you!
- It's so nice to see you!

29:45.851 --> 29:47.340
- You look great!
- Thank you. So do you.

29:47.341 --> 29:49.886
How are things
in that big city of yours?

29:49.922 --> 29:52.322
You know, a little different
than Red Rock here, but...

29:52.359 --> 29:55.203
You know, being here makes me
pump the brakes a little bit.

29:55.228 --> 29:55.928
Which I need.

29:55.937 --> 29:58.095
Well, home has a way
of doing that.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.996
Yeah. This is a good idea.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.849
Oh, yes. It's Tyler's idea.

30:01.850 --> 30:04.034
It's her brisket, actually.
Do you want to try some?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.535
Absolutely.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.642
That's amazing.
Hey, is she here?

30:12.678 --> 30:14.845
Yeah, she's around back
at the smoker.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.352
How's old Staubach doing?

30:22.621 --> 30:24.454
What are you doing back here?

30:27.192 --> 30:31.436
I was just out, out front with
your mom, and I tasted your brisket.

30:31.471 --> 30:33.663
Ty, man, it's crazy good.

30:33.732 --> 30:36.600
Like, really. The bark on it
was perfect...

30:36.635 --> 30:39.903
Okay.
I see what you're doing.

30:39.938 --> 30:41.271
What?

30:41.306 --> 30:43.251
Coming back here, trying to spy
on the competition,

30:43.275 --> 30:44.608
get some intel on my sauce...

30:44.643 --> 30:45.776
No, no.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.491
...in case I make it
into the final round.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.146
Trust me, I am not doing that.

30:49.214 --> 30:50.925
I'm going to tell you something,
Mister Turner.

30:50.949 --> 30:54.785
I will have you know that my
brisket and my sauce are off limits.

30:56.255 --> 31:00.890
- You need to flip those ribs.
- See what a distraction you are?

31:06.131 --> 31:09.585
Just so you know, I didn't come back
here for any insider information.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.128
I just came back here to tell you that

31:11.129 --> 31:13.549
that is honestly some of the
best brisket I've ever had.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.117
- Really?
- Really.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.943
And I wanted to see you again.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.149
Great music, by the way.

31:26.184 --> 31:28.218
That takes me back.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.288
Why is he leaving so soon?

31:34.826 --> 31:37.160
Okay, Ma, I know you think
of Corey like a son,

31:37.195 --> 31:40.986
but you can't just let him come back here
with out at least giving me a heads up.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.932
The first round is in three days.
He's the competition now.

31:43.936 --> 31:48.438
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.
I forgot how competitive you are.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.106
Here we go.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.542
I'm just saying, ever since
you were a little girl,

31:52.577 --> 31:54.878
you have always had
that desire to succeed,

31:54.913 --> 31:56.929
and it only makes me
love you more.

31:58.245 --> 32:02.419
Your sample idea is working.
We are getting so busy in there!

32:03.188 --> 32:04.188
Really?

32:06.744 --> 32:07.994
Told you!

32:15.534 --> 32:19.769
This was my absolute favorite place
in the world when I was your age.

32:19.838 --> 32:20.838
Really?

32:22.507 --> 32:24.310
Yeah, let's do it.
Come on. Of course.

32:27.806 --> 32:29.410
Thank you. Good to meet you.

32:29.411 --> 32:31.414
Well, look who it is.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.516
Hi, Corey.
This is my daughter, Rosie.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.084
- Hey, Rosie.
- Hi.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.090
- I'm Corey. Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.556
Your mom brought you to
the best ice cream in Texas.

32:39.592 --> 32:42.503
Yeah. You're the guy
from the cookbook, right?

32:42.527 --> 32:43.004
I am.

32:43.039 --> 32:44.873
Mom and Grandma
were just talking about you.

32:44.927 --> 32:47.452
Really? They were talking about me?
What were they saying?

32:48.200 --> 32:54.187
It was, it was at breakfast, and I was
asking Mom about your cookbook.

32:56.708 --> 32:57.691
Anyway...

32:57.743 --> 32:59.620
Want to sit with me and Mom?

32:59.644 --> 33:02.846
Thank you for the invite, Rosie.
I would love to do that.

33:02.914 --> 33:04.197
Here, you guys get something.

33:07.619 --> 33:11.195
Ice cream on a beautiful, sunny day.
It's no better than that, right?

33:12.290 --> 33:14.380
So, what else do you guys
have planned today?

33:14.392 --> 33:16.426
I'm going to work
on some of my sketches.

33:16.461 --> 33:17.606
Yeah? What do you sketch?

33:17.641 --> 33:20.679
Well, pretty much anything,
but right now I'm working on people.

33:20.966 --> 33:21.966
You any good?

33:22.329 --> 33:24.951
She's definitely the artistic one
in the family.

33:25.565 --> 33:29.167
Some day, I'd love for
my pictures to hang in a museum.

33:29.934 --> 33:32.537
You know what?
If you practice,

33:32.711 --> 33:35.912
I bet that dream
will absolutely come true.

33:37.782 --> 33:39.883
You know, we kind of do
the same thing.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.451
What do you mean?

33:41.519 --> 33:45.054
Well...
Can I use your spoon?

33:45.090 --> 33:46.055
Okay.

33:46.091 --> 33:50.527
Whether you are cooking
or painting,

33:50.762 --> 33:52.862
it's all about taking chances.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.282
Being creative.

33:54.730 --> 33:59.030
Because you never know what the
winning combination is going to be.

33:59.871 --> 34:05.008
Alright. So, you take a chance,
and try new things.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.978
- That's really good.
- Alright!

34:13.013 --> 34:16.469
- Here, Mom, you have to try this.
- Okay, let's see.

34:19.827 --> 34:21.429
- That's not bad!
- Right?

34:21.494 --> 34:22.967
That's not bad at all!

34:25.221 --> 34:26.435
Here, you do one.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.309
I'm going to add chocolate.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.312
Okay, everyone, can I get
your attention, please?

34:42.380 --> 34:45.949
Now, today we are going to do
things a little bit differently.

34:45.984 --> 34:48.585
We have a very special guest
joining us,

34:48.620 --> 34:51.822
so can you please help me
welcome Chef Corey Turner!

34:54.525 --> 34:58.395
Hey, guys! Mister Knowles tells me
you're having a great week, huh?

34:59.732 --> 35:01.676
Well, I am here to show you
how to make some good things

35:01.700 --> 35:03.545
in the kitchen,
talk about cooking a little bit.

35:03.569 --> 35:07.471
So, what I need to know is who is ready
to make something delicious?

35:09.074 --> 35:10.907
No, no, I can't hear you!
Who's ready?

35:12.478 --> 35:14.144
How are you guys doing, huh?

35:14.179 --> 35:15.223
How are these beans coming?

35:15.247 --> 35:16.791
I think I might have
forgotten something.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.615
Well, let's give them a taste
and see.

35:20.319 --> 35:21.351
How are they?

35:21.587 --> 35:24.187
Rosie!
Look, they're sweet enough,

35:24.223 --> 35:25.722
so you got your
brown sugar right.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.824
I'm getting a hint
of the garlic powder.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.494
They're fantastic.
They're better than your mom's.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.530
- Really?
- Really.

35:32.899 --> 35:35.009
Look, just don't tell her
I told you that.

35:35.033 --> 35:37.000
Alright, good job.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.802
Okay! How are you guys
up here?

35:42.674 --> 35:44.307
This was a great idea.

35:44.343 --> 35:47.310
Please remember,
try not to hit the pitcher.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.116
I should have gone pro!

35:55.420 --> 35:57.022
Alright.

35:57.656 --> 36:02.869
So, tell me, how you feeling about
potentially competing against Tyler?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.933
Well, I guess there's my answer.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.169
Tyler I'm not worried about.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.305
You know, by the way,
I thought I was coming back here

36:14.306 --> 36:18.141
for an appearance at the cook off,
not to actually compete in it.

36:18.210 --> 36:21.096
You're actually going to take
this competition seriously, aren't you?

36:21.981 --> 36:23.948
- One more.
- Alright.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.220
I am not getting that.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.860
- Hey, I went by Jo and Ray's.
- Yeah?

36:36.895 --> 36:39.195
Man, when I went through
those doors, I'm telling you.

36:39.231 --> 36:42.699
- Memories, huh?
- Oh, man.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.202
But you know what it did?

36:47.706 --> 36:51.374
It reminded me of why I started
cooking in the first place.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.075
Oh, yeah?

36:52.111 --> 36:54.409
It was barbecue, and that
restaurant, and that family,

36:54.444 --> 36:56.346
...were the whole reason
I wanted to become a chef.

36:56.962 --> 37:00.483
Because now...
You know, now I'm just...

37:02.220 --> 37:03.520
...I don't know.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.856
What?

37:06.892 --> 37:10.260
I'm a brand, you know.
Writing books,

37:10.295 --> 37:13.712
and making appearances,
and I'm managing restaurants.

37:14.166 --> 37:17.602
I miss getting my hands messy, and
just being in the excitement all day long.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.636
You know?

37:19.671 --> 37:22.439
I'm grateful, of course.
But...

37:27.346 --> 37:28.445
But what?

37:31.083 --> 37:33.483
It just made me stop and think.

37:33.552 --> 37:37.120
Maybe... I don't know.

37:38.977 --> 37:41.458
Come on. I'm up.

37:41.493 --> 37:45.195
Alright. At least I know
I won't have to shag any balls,

37:45.230 --> 37:46.529
because you won't hit anything.

37:57.843 --> 38:01.745
You keep pacing like that, you're
going to wear a hole in my porch.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.881
Sorry, I'm just trying
to figure something out.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.517
I feel like the sauce for
the brisket just isn't right.

38:07.552 --> 38:09.285
Tyler, the sauce is good.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.695
It got a whole lot of new
customers into the restaurant.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.411
Yeah, but that's the thing.
I don't want it to be just good.

38:14.446 --> 38:18.395
I don't want it to be great.
I want it to be extraordinary.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.130
And it will be.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.499
The competition's in two days.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.801
Tyler, you've got to trust yourself.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.303
They're not expecting
Tyler Dawson, Ma.

38:27.339 --> 38:30.140
They're expecting the daughter
of Jo and Ray Dawson,

38:30.175 --> 38:33.610
the five time winners
of the Red Rock barbecue contest.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.497
Come on. Come, sit. Listen...

38:38.834 --> 38:41.783
...you have always been
so hard on yourself,

38:42.130 --> 38:45.026
but all this over-thinking, it's
just leads you to doubt yourself.

38:45.027 --> 38:46.907
Listen, what were you saying
to Rosie the other day...

38:46.908 --> 38:48.787
...when you two were
cooking in the kitchen?

38:49.791 --> 38:52.492
Don't eat so much at once.
You'll choke?

38:52.527 --> 38:56.496
No. No, you told her that
the most important thing

38:56.531 --> 38:59.817
about cooking sometimes
is letting things breathe.

38:59.880 --> 39:03.236
Well, I believe that same is true of life.

39:04.270 --> 39:07.271
Sometimes you just
have to let things breathe.

39:11.478 --> 39:12.910
Trust yourself.

39:34.567 --> 39:38.035
<i>Okay, step right up!
Two for a dollar! Step right up!</i>

39:42.008 --> 39:44.370
Alright, everyone. We're going
to be starting in a few minutes.

39:44.405 --> 39:47.245
I want to remind you that on
today's menu we have chicken,

39:47.280 --> 39:49.014
and one side dish.

39:49.015 --> 39:52.216
Now, contestants, please make
your way to your stations.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.186
Here we go.
Wish me luck.

39:55.221 --> 39:57.188
- You got this, Mom.
- Good luck, sweetheart.

39:57.223 --> 39:59.558
- You make us proud, Tyler.
- Okay.

40:05.698 --> 40:08.666
- Well, how's it going here?
- Good.

40:08.868 --> 40:10.935
Hey, don't forget to wait
on the blue smoke.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.771
Okay, thank you.

40:13.806 --> 40:16.707
Alright.
I can see when I'm not wanted.

40:16.776 --> 40:18.309
Corey.

40:18.344 --> 40:19.277
Yes.

40:19.312 --> 40:22.580
- I wanted to say thank you.
- For what?

40:22.615 --> 40:25.449
For what you said to Rosie.
For making her feel so special.

40:25.485 --> 40:26.517
Well, she is special.

40:28.488 --> 40:30.855
Like her mom.

40:30.924 --> 40:33.624
Contestants!
Places, please.

40:33.660 --> 40:34.892
Good luck.

40:34.928 --> 40:37.652
Now remember, you have
three hours on the clock...

40:37.653 --> 40:40.598
...to make your chicken,
and your side dish.

40:40.633 --> 40:43.434
Contestants ready?
Set? Smoker!

41:22.709 --> 41:26.065
<i>And it looks like we've got about
a half an hour left, contestants.</i>

41:26.100 --> 41:27.511
Half an hour!

41:30.650 --> 41:32.650
One minute left, folks.
One minute left.

41:34.421 --> 41:39.490
<i>Five, four, three, two, one!</i>

41:41.828 --> 41:43.461
Hands up!
Hands up!

41:48.968 --> 41:50.668
<i>You are so ready for this.</i>

41:50.669 --> 41:52.837
You've been prepping
for your whole life, honey.

41:52.872 --> 41:54.631
So, what happens now?

41:55.141 --> 41:56.785
Well, they're almost done
with the tasting,

41:56.809 --> 41:58.476
and then they'll rank us.

41:58.511 --> 42:02.332
<i>Well, it looks like the judges
have come to their final decision.</i>

42:02.733 --> 42:06.117
Now let's give all of the contestants
a big round of applause.

42:07.053 --> 42:08.053
Well done!

42:08.349 --> 42:11.282
I don't know how that tasted,
but it smelled fantastic.

42:12.358 --> 42:14.012
Here we are.
Thank you very much.

42:14.594 --> 42:16.360
Okay.

42:17.430 --> 42:21.399
Very good.
Our first semi-finalist...

42:21.434 --> 42:22.434
...Chef Steve!

42:24.537 --> 42:28.406
Our second semi-finalist...
Chef Austin!

42:28.441 --> 42:29.441
Yes!

42:32.512 --> 42:36.280
And our third semi-finalist,
is none other than Chef Jackson!

42:42.155 --> 42:44.708
And last but not least...

42:44.709 --> 42:49.656
...our final semi-finalist is...

42:50.697 --> 42:52.563
...Chef Tyler!

42:57.070 --> 42:58.669
Congrats!

42:58.705 --> 43:00.182
<i>Good job, everyone!
Congratulations to everyone!</i>

43:00.206 --> 43:01.839
Terrific job!
Wonderful!

43:01.874 --> 43:03.474
- Way to go.
- Thanks.

43:05.011 --> 43:07.111
- Congrats. Great job.
- Thank you.

43:07.146 --> 43:08.146
<i>Corey!</i>

43:09.215 --> 43:10.948
<i>Sofia!</i>

43:10.983 --> 43:12.216
What are you doing here?

43:12.285 --> 43:14.819
I'm here to get you on a plane
back to New York.

43:19.661 --> 43:22.895
Rosie, Tyler, George, Jo,
this is Sofia,

43:22.964 --> 43:23.964
...my business manager.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.167
Hi.

43:28.536 --> 43:30.503
We have some things
we have to deal with,

43:30.538 --> 43:32.004
so excuse us for one second.

43:34.042 --> 43:35.808
You haven't returned
any of my phone calls,

43:35.844 --> 43:37.777
so I had to come
track you down myself.

43:37.812 --> 43:39.252
The network is calling me
constantly.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.947
They want to meet with you
tomorrow.

43:40.982 --> 43:43.616
Tomorrow? Sofia, there's
no way I can do tomorrow.

43:43.651 --> 43:45.386
Corey, they're chomping at the bit.

43:45.387 --> 43:46.954
I have been working with them
for a long time.

43:46.955 --> 43:48.724
I've never seen them
this excited.

43:48.757 --> 43:51.558
Corey, Corey, we've got
to go do the press conference,

43:51.593 --> 43:52.926
over at the community centre.

43:52.927 --> 43:54.661
- Hi, I'm Jay.
- Hi.

43:54.729 --> 43:55.430
Sorry.

43:55.465 --> 43:57.788
Jay, Sofia, Sofia, Jay.
She's my manager.

43:57.823 --> 44:00.099
Sorry. Barbecue sauce.
It won't happen again.

44:00.135 --> 44:02.068
Alright, we have to get
down to this thing.

44:02.103 --> 44:04.971
- Would you like to come with us?
- I'm going where you're going.

44:05.040 --> 44:06.040
Okay.

44:07.609 --> 44:09.542
Chef Jackson, what
are you planning to do

44:09.778 --> 44:11.911
with the prize money if you win?

44:11.946 --> 44:14.247
Well, I think you mean
when I win,

44:14.282 --> 44:17.250
and I'll probably take a much
needed Caribbean vacation.

44:20.388 --> 44:24.557
Chef Tyler, didn't your parents
win this competition five times?

44:24.592 --> 44:26.559
Yes, yes they did.

44:26.594 --> 44:31.330
And is it true that you and Chef Corey
were once high school sweethearts?

44:31.366 --> 44:35.501
That was also a long time ago.

44:35.537 --> 44:39.505
- I still feel like I'm eighteen, though.
- And sometimes you act like it.

44:43.011 --> 44:45.845
Okay, okay, okay.
Before we finish,

44:45.880 --> 44:47.680
I want to announce
the second round menu

44:47.715 --> 44:51.484
for the semi-finals,
which happens in four days.

44:51.519 --> 44:54.720
And on the menu will be
barbecued ribs,

44:54.789 --> 44:56.722
along with your choice of sides,

44:56.791 --> 44:59.025
and we will be once again
at the on-site grills.

44:59.060 --> 45:02.495
And remember, three of you
will be eliminated.

45:02.530 --> 45:03.796
Alright, good luck to you all.

45:09.471 --> 45:10.867
I'm going to get you back.

45:13.586 --> 45:14.738
Sofia.

45:14.776 --> 45:16.756
So, what's there to do
in this town?

45:18.580 --> 45:20.780
Jay! Jay! Jay!

45:20.815 --> 45:25.585
Jay is the perfect tour guide,
and he would love to take you

45:25.620 --> 45:27.004
and show you our
charming, little town.

45:27.022 --> 45:28.412
- I would?
- Sure, you would.

45:28.413 --> 45:31.519
And Sofia was just saying
how much she wanted to see...

45:31.520 --> 45:32.425
...all the sights of Red Rock.

45:32.460 --> 45:34.293
- I did?
- Sure, you did.

45:34.329 --> 45:36.462
You seem like a very busy woman.

45:36.498 --> 45:37.498
You guys have fun.

46:00.588 --> 46:02.121
It's over here.

46:06.070 --> 46:07.262
They moved it.

46:08.996 --> 46:11.163
- Yeah.
- See?

46:11.959 --> 46:14.044
<i>It's held up pretty good,
given how old it is.</i>

46:14.064 --> 46:15.266
<i>I should hope so.</i>

46:15.267 --> 46:17.936
I think it took you
two hours to carve that in.

46:17.972 --> 46:18.972
Probably.

46:20.341 --> 46:23.475
- Do you want to sit?
- Sure.

46:28.549 --> 46:31.951
What? What is going on
up there?

46:31.986 --> 46:35.654
I... Nothing.

46:35.723 --> 46:38.490
Okay, listen. I know that
it's been a long time,

46:38.559 --> 46:40.926
but I can still read
your lousy poker face.

46:40.962 --> 46:46.866
Okay. I guess I was just wondering
how it went with your manager.

46:48.759 --> 46:51.657
Listen, for the record,
she is just my manager.

46:54.108 --> 46:55.975
No, she flew down here
because we have

46:56.043 --> 46:57.509
a big meeting set
with the network

46:57.545 --> 46:58.844
who wants to do a show.

46:59.131 --> 47:01.725
So, she's just making sure
I get back there on time.

47:01.749 --> 47:04.230
So, she says she's not leaving
without me.

47:04.752 --> 47:06.952
So, I guess that means
she's going to stick around

47:07.021 --> 47:08.387
till I finish the cook off.

47:08.456 --> 47:12.463
Good. Then we get to keep you
a little while longer.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.620
That was a sweet thing to say.

47:15.263 --> 47:17.263
Well, you know, you don't
want to disappoint Jay,

47:17.331 --> 47:18.697
and the citizens of Red Rock.

47:18.733 --> 47:21.000
No, Jay. Don't want
to disappoint Jay and Red Rock.

47:21.035 --> 47:22.534
Definitely not.

47:22.570 --> 47:23.782
What about you? Huh?

47:23.783 --> 47:26.205
When do you go back
to San Francisco?

47:26.240 --> 47:29.808
I think we're going to stay for a few
more weeks until school starts.

47:29.844 --> 47:32.511
They gave you a nice vacation.

47:32.546 --> 47:37.383
- It's not exactly a vacation.
- What do you mean?

47:37.451 --> 47:42.621
Okay, the restaurant I was working
in closed down about a month ago.

47:42.657 --> 47:46.425
So, you're looking at an unemployed
sous chef, with a thing for barbecue.

47:46.460 --> 47:49.828
- Sorry, Tyler.
- It's okay.

47:49.864 --> 47:53.166
Well, hey, do you ever just think
about opening up your own place?

47:53.200 --> 47:54.411
Yeah, of course.

47:54.412 --> 47:56.422
But I want to do it
on my own terms,

47:56.423 --> 47:58.500
and I want to do it
in my own time.

47:58.745 --> 48:01.408
Mark my words, though.
One day it's going to happen.

48:01.603 --> 48:03.195
I have no doubt.

48:07.581 --> 48:09.715
We're going to squeeze you in.
I promise we will.

48:09.750 --> 48:12.251
You might have a little bit
of a wait, because you see,

48:12.286 --> 48:13.886
it's been kind of busy.

48:14.341 --> 48:15.754
- Y'all are slammed!
- I know!

48:15.790 --> 48:17.087
- This is amazing.
- I know!

48:17.122 --> 48:18.568
What, with the sample table outside,

48:18.592 --> 48:20.392
and all the local news coverage,
we've got...

48:20.429 --> 48:23.895
People coming back.
But, we're a little busy right now,

48:23.930 --> 48:26.984
- ... so we could really use a hand.
- Yeah. I got it. I got it.

48:28.035 --> 48:29.268
Hey, hey!

48:29.337 --> 48:30.536
What are you doing here?

48:30.571 --> 48:32.204
Tell me what you need, Chef.

48:33.407 --> 48:35.047
Okay. We need fully loaded
baked potatoes,

48:35.076 --> 48:36.909
and biscuits on all
these orders.

48:36.944 --> 48:37.944
Yes, ma'am.

48:47.088 --> 48:48.488
Pulled pork is up!

48:54.161 --> 48:56.363
- Perfect.
- Chicken's up!

49:04.972 --> 49:08.166
Alright, guys, sorry.
Brisket here. Pulled pork here.

49:08.201 --> 49:11.276
Let me get you some napkins. Did you
guys need anything else? You're good?

49:13.014 --> 49:14.014
Good.

49:25.159 --> 49:27.626
- Sorry.
- Watch it, buddy.

49:27.661 --> 49:28.661
You watch it.

49:30.888 --> 49:33.098
Okay, make it stop. I can't.

49:33.134 --> 49:37.069
I'm so glad you guys
closed early tonight.

49:37.104 --> 49:40.073
I mean, I don't think
I had anything left in me. Honestly.

49:40.142 --> 49:42.386
Yeah, Mom and Rosie wanted
to get to the festival early,

49:42.410 --> 49:44.043
so you can thank them.

49:44.078 --> 49:45.078
I will.

49:49.450 --> 49:50.843
You good?

49:51.585 --> 49:55.554
I think that was the most fun I've had
in a kitchen in a long time.

49:56.424 --> 50:00.526
Back in San Francisco,
I wasn't really enjoying myself.

50:00.561 --> 50:03.262
- No?
- No.

50:04.398 --> 50:08.497
For me, it feels like that was the
first time I was in a kitchen in forever.

50:08.532 --> 50:10.335
It's just been all business lately.

50:10.371 --> 50:13.672
Boardrooms, book signings, just...
You know.

50:13.707 --> 50:16.075
I miss it. I miss that.
That was, that was fun.

50:16.143 --> 50:17.843
It was.

50:22.850 --> 50:24.089
Remember that one?

50:24.885 --> 50:26.552
That brings back memories.

50:33.794 --> 50:35.595
- Why not?
- Why not?

51:19.073 --> 51:20.173
Tyler?

51:22.510 --> 51:23.542
Eddie?

51:32.186 --> 51:35.053
I'm sorry. I hope
I'm not interrupting?

51:35.122 --> 51:37.524
- No, no, just... Cleaning up.
- No!

51:37.558 --> 51:38.668
You're not interrupting.
I'm sorry.

51:38.692 --> 51:41.928
- This is Eddie, and this is...
- Corey.

51:41.963 --> 51:44.411
- Nice to meet you, Corey.
- Nice to meet you, as well.

51:45.166 --> 51:48.135
Hey, I said I would meet Jay
and Sofia over at the festival,

51:48.170 --> 51:49.335
- ... so I'm going to take off.
- Okay.

51:49.404 --> 51:50.718
- It's good to meet you, Eddie.
- You, too.

51:50.805 --> 51:51.922
Alright. See you, guys!

51:54.809 --> 51:56.680
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

51:57.144 --> 52:00.312
I wanted to surprise Rosie...
And you.

52:00.864 --> 52:04.863
Well, I'm definitely surprised.

52:05.252 --> 52:07.730
Rosie's going to be so happy
to see you, though.

52:09.957 --> 52:12.591
- Where are you staying?
- I got a room at a hotel nearby.

52:12.626 --> 52:14.226
- Great.
- Yeah.

52:14.261 --> 52:15.572
Rosie and my mom
are at the festival,

52:15.596 --> 52:17.529
and I was just about
to head over.

52:17.565 --> 52:20.366
- Do you want to go with me?
- I'd love to.

52:24.271 --> 52:26.705
I can't believe I haven't even
looked at my phone all day.

52:26.740 --> 52:28.707
You're going to need
a napkin when you're done.

52:30.544 --> 52:33.193
I am glad Corey made you
be my tour guide.

52:33.547 --> 52:35.614
Corey didn't make me
do anything.

52:35.683 --> 52:38.517
You know, in Texas,
we eat those, not wear them.

52:38.552 --> 52:40.919
These alone could keep me
in Red Rock for another week.

52:40.988 --> 52:43.989
And the network got back to me.
I bought us a little time.

52:44.024 --> 52:44.856
Great. Great.

52:44.892 --> 52:45.825
Where you been?

52:45.828 --> 52:48.230
I was over helping Tyler
and Jo at the restaurant.

52:48.296 --> 52:51.129
Yeah. And I met
Tyler's ex-husband.

52:53.834 --> 52:55.801
- Hi, Corey!
- Hey, where'd you come from?

52:55.836 --> 52:58.370
- We were just on the ferris wheel.
- Fun.

52:58.439 --> 52:59.772
Welcome to Red Rock.
I'm Jay.

52:59.807 --> 53:01.173
I'm Eddie.
Nice to meet you.

53:01.242 --> 53:02.953
I'm Sofia.
I'm usually not this messy.

53:04.113 --> 53:06.412
Mom, look!
It's my favorite - Longhorns!

53:06.864 --> 53:09.770
I'm on it. I'm on it.
Excuse me.

53:10.484 --> 53:12.485
- Coming?
- Ferris wheel.

53:12.553 --> 53:14.487
- Yes.
- Shall we?

53:15.356 --> 53:17.601
So, Dad wanted
to hang out with me in town

53:17.625 --> 53:19.391
a little bit tomorrow.
Do you mind?

53:19.427 --> 53:21.827
Of course not. I want you
to spend as much time

53:21.896 --> 53:23.462
with him as possible
while he's here.

53:23.531 --> 53:25.781
Cool. And thanks.

53:25.782 --> 53:27.599
I had a really fun time
at the festival.

53:27.635 --> 53:30.803
Good. It was really fun,
wasn't it?

53:30.838 --> 53:33.372
I even collected some
ticket stubs, and a postcard

53:33.407 --> 53:35.074
for my summer camp project.

53:35.109 --> 53:37.778
I'll bet you made
enough great memories...

53:37.779 --> 53:40.379
...to make yourself
a beautiful sketch.

53:40.414 --> 53:43.698
Absolutely. It's funny.

53:43.699 --> 53:46.251
I never knew how much
I was going to like it here.

53:46.891 --> 53:48.736
I was hoping you'd say that.

53:49.356 --> 53:54.092
I mean, San Francisco is great, but
I really like spending time with Grandma,

53:54.127 --> 53:55.494
...and helping out
in the restaurant.

53:56.897 --> 54:00.133
But most importantly, I really like
spending more time with you, Mom.

54:02.203 --> 54:04.670
Me, too.
Come on.

54:07.475 --> 54:09.842
<i>And so, you have
to make sure that your sauce</i>

54:09.877 --> 54:11.710
<i>compliments the flavor
of your meat,</i>

54:11.746 --> 54:15.781
<i>because the sauce that we made
here today for the pulled pork,</i>

54:15.850 --> 54:20.152
<i>may not compliment your chicken,
or say, your ribs.</i>

54:24.692 --> 54:26.692
Pretty good. But listen,
the reality is this...

54:26.760 --> 54:28.460
What's going on?

54:28.496 --> 54:31.497
The Women's Auxiliary requested
a private cooking lesson

54:31.565 --> 54:32.765
with the town's favorite chef.

54:33.734 --> 54:35.968
Not the kind of group
you say no to.

54:36.003 --> 54:38.003
<i>The spoons,
all that's out the window.</i>

54:38.072 --> 54:40.973
If you'll excuse me,
festival duty calls.

54:41.008 --> 54:43.008
<i>That's why, for me,
it's important that</i>

54:43.077 --> 54:45.777
you don't want to use too much
Worcestershire in the sauce,

54:45.813 --> 54:47.079
because that will over pow...

54:47.748 --> 54:49.523
Excuse me, back of the room.

54:51.118 --> 54:54.386
<i>It seems like you disagree
with expert opinion.</i>

54:54.421 --> 54:56.945
Sorry, I...

54:57.858 --> 55:02.695
No, I just... You're making
pulled pork, right?

55:03.097 --> 55:04.163
I am, indeed.

55:04.232 --> 55:05.737
Okay, well, this is just my opinion,

55:05.738 --> 55:07.343
but I really feel that the
Worcestershire and garlic

55:07.399 --> 55:11.603
...are what brings out
the boldness of the pork.

55:11.672 --> 55:15.073
Very interesting suggestions.

55:16.510 --> 55:18.577
Why don't you come on up
and join the discussion?

55:18.646 --> 55:20.846
No, no, I just...
I've got to go.

55:20.881 --> 55:23.882
Ladies, please welcome Red
Rock's own, Chef Tyler Dawson!

55:26.053 --> 55:28.487
Come on up.
We'll get you looking official,

55:28.522 --> 55:32.157
and you can just take over,
and make your own...

55:32.193 --> 55:34.660
- Thanks, thanks.
- ... version of this.

55:34.695 --> 55:36.362
- Hi.
- Hi!

55:36.897 --> 55:40.132
Alright, let's give this
a try, shall we?

55:42.136 --> 55:43.136
Well?

55:45.005 --> 55:49.842
As I suspected, Worcestershire
and garlic are key to pulled pork.

55:50.878 --> 55:52.611
But you know what?
This is a good start.

55:52.914 --> 55:55.280
- It's a good start.
- It's a good start. Okay.

55:56.284 --> 55:58.295
So just so we're
all on the same page,

55:58.319 --> 56:01.954
she said that my finished sauce
was a good start for her.

56:02.890 --> 56:03.890
Interesting.

56:05.092 --> 56:06.892
So, we'll just take this
as a base.

56:08.462 --> 56:12.530
I think we're going to do one and a half
tablespoons of Worcestershire,

56:12.665 --> 56:18.637
and then I think we're going
to go with the raw garlic.

56:20.941 --> 56:25.077
Ladies, what do you think about
a blind taste test with Chef Corey?

56:25.112 --> 56:27.045
Yes!

56:27.081 --> 56:29.249
Let me...
Let me be your assistant here.

56:29.284 --> 56:30.334
Help me out.

56:30.369 --> 56:31.384
- Okay.
- Yup.

56:31.453 --> 56:34.033
Let's just make sure
this is nice and snug.

56:35.512 --> 56:37.222
- Plenty tight, thank you.
- Okay, good.

56:37.258 --> 56:42.114
- Can't see a thing.
- Don't want you peeking at all.

56:45.199 --> 56:46.164
Sauce number one.

56:46.200 --> 56:49.901
- Nice. Nice.
- Pretty good, huh?

56:49.936 --> 56:52.504
Here comes sauce number two.

56:57.544 --> 56:58.544
Okay.

56:59.313 --> 57:02.214
- Which one tasted better?
- Two, definitely.

57:02.283 --> 57:06.485
Well, you were right...
To choose my sauce!

57:10.491 --> 57:12.591
No clapping! No clapping!
I quit!

57:20.434 --> 57:21.833
Yes!

57:29.810 --> 57:32.277
You know, this morning
you woke up, and you were not

57:32.313 --> 57:34.780
a potato sack champion.
Look at you now!

57:37.618 --> 57:40.085
Ferris wheel. Come on.
Let's go do that.

57:40.120 --> 57:43.222
No, no, no. I have so much
prep work to do. I should go.

57:43.257 --> 57:44.960
It's five minutes.
It'll be fun. Come on.

57:46.961 --> 57:50.095
<i>So, it's good to see
you still have all...</i>

57:50.130 --> 57:51.730
<i>...the competitiveness
really going.</i>

57:51.765 --> 57:53.899
Yeah, I'm kind of intense.

57:53.900 --> 57:56.101
Especially when it comes
to potato sack races.

57:56.170 --> 57:57.336
Or darts.

57:57.371 --> 57:59.705
Okay, maybe
a little too intense.

57:59.940 --> 58:02.774
I know, I'm very competitive.

58:02.843 --> 58:07.679
I think it's this whole afraid to fail thing
I've been carrying around my whole life.

58:07.715 --> 58:09.414
What are you talking about?

58:09.483 --> 58:10.650
It's in everything.

58:10.651 --> 58:13.418
I have it with running
a kitchen, it's this cook off.

58:13.487 --> 58:15.004
Tyler, Tyler, stop.

58:15.305 --> 58:18.400
I guarantee you, you are
as talented, or probably more,

58:18.401 --> 58:20.158
than what your parents are.

58:23.230 --> 58:24.329
Are we stuck?

58:27.701 --> 58:29.741
Hey, hey, hey.

58:31.972 --> 58:35.098
- Just, let's just take in the view.
- Okay.

58:38.779 --> 58:40.703
It is beautiful up here.

58:42.616 --> 58:44.483
Yeah, everything's
beautiful up here.

58:54.195 --> 58:55.395
Really?

59:02.369 --> 59:05.303
- You didn't, Mom.
- I did! I did! Look!

59:06.073 --> 59:07.806
Hi! How was your day?

59:07.875 --> 59:10.575
Great. We went to
the festival's petting zoo,

59:10.611 --> 59:12.244
and then we went on a hayride.

59:12.513 --> 59:14.112
And are you hungry?

59:14.148 --> 59:15.647
- Always!
- Of course.

59:15.683 --> 59:18.383
Okay, come on.
Let's get something to eat.

59:18.419 --> 59:19.718
Thank you.

59:19.753 --> 59:22.866
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, what's going on?

59:23.223 --> 59:26.502
So, I was waiting for that phone call,
and we just got confirmation.

59:26.537 --> 59:29.713
We're opening up another
restaurant in San Francisco.

59:30.397 --> 59:32.330
And we want you to be head chef.

59:35.436 --> 59:38.236
I can't believe this.

59:38.305 --> 59:41.445
I mean, you may have to cut your
summer vacation a little bit short,

59:41.480 --> 59:44.209
...but isn't this what
you've always wanted?

59:44.244 --> 59:49.781
It's amazing! I just,
I need to think about it.

59:49.817 --> 59:54.319
What's there to think about?
I thought you'd be over the moon.

59:54.354 --> 59:58.831
Yeah, a week ago I would
have been, but now I...

59:58.866 --> 01:00:00.191
And I have Rosie's
birthday tomorrow,

01:00:00.227 --> 01:00:02.260
I have everything I need to prep
for the second round.

01:00:02.329 --> 01:00:04.616
It's just,
it's a little overwhelming.

01:00:05.299 --> 01:00:06.865
I just need some time to think.

01:00:06.934 --> 01:00:08.767
I think it's good you're
thinking it through.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:12.203
You're obviously taking
it seriously, so...

01:00:12.239 --> 01:00:14.473
Just let me know soon, okay?

01:00:14.508 --> 01:00:16.767
Yeah, of course.
Thank you.

01:00:17.478 --> 01:00:21.246
Don't thank me.
You've earned it. Okay?

01:00:35.662 --> 01:00:40.499
Would you just slow down a bit?
Why are we walking so fast?

01:00:41.678 --> 01:00:46.172
Sorry. Sorry, Mom.
I'm just, I'm distracted.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.773
What is wrong?

01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:49.777
Eddie offered me
the head chef position

01:00:49.778 --> 01:00:51.744
at a new restaurant
in San Francisco.

01:00:51.779 --> 01:00:53.479
Honey!
Well, that's wonderful!

01:00:53.514 --> 01:00:56.816
It is, it is. But I don't know
if I want it.

01:00:56.884 --> 01:00:59.485
But, hasn't that always
been your dream?

01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:01.971
Yes, until this week.

01:01:01.972 --> 01:01:05.165
Being back here, cooking barbecue again,

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:09.903
spending quality time with you
and Rosie, it just, it feels right.

01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:12.531
Maybe I belong here.

01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:15.635
Look, there's nothing
I would like better

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:19.038
than having you and Rosie back here,
but I think you really have

01:01:19.073 --> 01:01:22.842
to think this through, and make sure
it's what you really want.

01:01:22.877 --> 01:01:26.512
And I know one thing for sure,
whatever choice you make

01:01:26.547 --> 01:01:29.749
it is going to be the right
choice for you and Rosie.

01:01:29.784 --> 01:01:30.784
Thanks, Mom.

01:01:33.554 --> 01:01:35.488
Now, let's go get
that birthday cake, huh?

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:39.325
And this time, let's walk
like they do in Texas.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.360
Nice and easy.

01:01:42.997 --> 01:01:43.796
Okay, go!

01:01:48.803 --> 01:01:49.803
Corey!

01:01:51.038 --> 01:01:53.072
Hey, happy birthday!

01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:54.141
Thank you!

01:01:55.009 --> 01:01:56.009
You're welcome.

01:01:57.612 --> 01:02:00.392
- Do you have it?
- Whoa! No! I love it!

01:02:00.427 --> 01:02:02.047
- You'll love it! It's good.
- Thank you so much!

01:02:02.116 --> 01:02:03.182
You're welcome.

01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:05.918
Sweetheart, everyone is raving
about your ribs,

01:02:05.953 --> 01:02:07.953
and quite right, too.
They're delicious.

01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:10.356
Thank you. I'm trying out
a new sauce for the competition.

01:02:10.792 --> 01:02:13.303
So, hopefully the judges
like it tomorrow, too.

01:02:13.327 --> 01:02:14.960
Well, they'd be fools not to.

01:02:14.996 --> 01:02:18.264
- Good to see you, Eddie.
- You, too. You, too.

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:20.466
- Let me take that for you.
- Thank you.

01:02:20.501 --> 01:02:22.768
- Can I fix you a plate?
- Yes, please.

01:02:22.804 --> 01:02:24.270
Okay. Why don't you
take this one?

01:02:24.305 --> 01:02:25.271
Thank you.

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:26.172
Get some watermelon.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.606
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

01:02:27.642 --> 01:02:29.342
- Hi!
- How are you?

01:02:29.377 --> 01:02:31.101
Do you want to come play
pin the tail on the cow with me?

01:02:31.146 --> 01:02:33.870
Why don't you let your dad eat,
and I will play with you?

01:02:33.895 --> 01:02:36.116
- Okay.
- I'll be there in a bit. I promise, okay?

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:39.283
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:02:40.588 --> 01:02:42.355
- Hey, Eddie. Corey.
- Hey!

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:44.223
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah. You, too.

01:02:44.258 --> 01:02:46.119
- You alright?
- Doing great.

01:02:46.154 --> 01:02:47.604
With a spread like this,
how could you not be?

01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:53.866
You... you based in San Francisco
as well?

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:55.267
Yes, I am. Yeah.

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:56.836
Yeah? How's that?
Do you like it?

01:02:56.871 --> 01:02:59.672
Things are good.
And how about the cook off?

01:02:59.707 --> 01:03:00.907
You ready for the final round?

01:03:00.942 --> 01:03:05.314
I guess. But, you know, doesn't
matter how much prep you do,

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:07.847
something always happens
that you don't expect.

01:03:07.882 --> 01:03:09.098
I hear you.

01:03:09.099 --> 01:03:12.017
By the way, you've got yourself some
pretty steep competition here, my friend.

01:03:12.053 --> 01:03:13.786
These ribs are delicious.

01:03:13.821 --> 01:03:17.438
- She is a great chef.
- That she is.

01:03:18.306 --> 01:03:22.007
And if my company had of put Tyler in
charge of the restaurant to begin with,

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.829
it may have survived.

01:03:23.865 --> 01:03:25.856
I just hope she accepts
our new offer.

01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:27.411
New offer?

01:03:28.302 --> 01:03:30.024
She didn't tell you?

01:03:30.872 --> 01:03:33.306
We offered Tyler
the position of head chef...

01:03:33.307 --> 01:03:35.140
...back at our new restaurant
in San Francisco.

01:03:35.176 --> 01:03:36.408
Great!

01:03:36.444 --> 01:03:38.974
So, it looks like her summer vacation
may be cut a little bit short.

01:03:39.009 --> 01:03:41.113
But you know how it is, right?
Right?

01:03:41.148 --> 01:03:43.525
When opportunity knocks,
you've got to run.

01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:45.151
Yeah.

01:03:46.687 --> 01:03:50.606
Well, if you'll excuse me, it looks like
I've got to go pin a tail on a cow.

01:03:50.607 --> 01:03:52.725
Now there's something
you don't say every day, right?

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.728
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.467
<i>No. Well, this is why
adults don't play.</i>

01:04:02.141 --> 01:04:04.314
<i>The fun part for me
is definitely seeing the prep,</i>

01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:05.883
and seeing everybody
put their rubs together,

01:04:05.907 --> 01:04:07.606
and start to get things
ready to go,

01:04:07.675 --> 01:04:09.208
and then slap it on the grill.

01:04:09.243 --> 01:04:11.711
Look, I think it's going to be
a great competition. Good luck.

01:04:16.551 --> 01:04:17.551
<i>Hey!</i>

01:04:17.585 --> 01:04:18.829
Hey. How'd it go
with the reporter?

01:04:18.853 --> 01:04:19.853
Fine.

01:04:22.657 --> 01:04:24.824
- What was that?
- What was what?

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.161
What was that little,
smiley wave thing you just did?

01:04:27.844 --> 01:04:29.596
Is there something
going on here?

01:04:29.631 --> 01:04:33.165
What? No! I mean,
I don't think so.

01:04:33.201 --> 01:04:34.201
Okay, maybe.

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:36.252
Like... Look...

01:04:36.253 --> 01:04:38.148
He's not my normal type,
but I find him interesting.

01:04:38.172 --> 01:04:39.271
Alright.

01:04:39.307 --> 01:04:41.384
And cute, and enough
about my love life.

01:04:41.408 --> 01:04:43.008
Just go charm the good people
of Red Rock,

01:04:43.044 --> 01:04:44.944
...and I will see you
after the contest.

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:50.215
Hey!

01:04:50.284 --> 01:04:51.828
I just wanted to say thanks
for coming to the party.

01:04:51.852 --> 01:04:54.520
Yeah. It was fun.
Had a chance to talk to Eddie.

01:04:54.555 --> 01:04:56.789
- He's a good guy.
- Yeah.

01:04:56.824 --> 01:04:58.602
And he told me about your
job offer in San Francisco.

01:04:58.626 --> 01:05:00.125
Congrats!
That's, that's huge.

01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:02.081
Kind of a no-brainer
for you, huh?

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:05.263
When you... when you thinking
about heading back?

01:05:06.367 --> 01:05:10.230
I don't know. When are you
heading back to New York?

01:05:11.626 --> 01:05:13.939
Tyler, let me ask you something.
I just want you to be honest with me.

01:05:13.975 --> 01:05:16.630
<i>Contestants!
Please take your places.</i>

01:05:16.665 --> 01:05:18.046
No, no, go.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.746
We're about to begin.
Remember that you have

01:05:20.781 --> 01:05:23.882
four hours to complete
your rib dishes,

01:05:23.918 --> 01:05:27.319
along with your side dishes.
Contestants ready?

01:05:27.388 --> 01:05:29.788
Set?

01:05:30.091 --> 01:05:31.091
Barbecue!

01:05:43.204 --> 01:05:44.681
<i>Let's go!
You know it, Tyler!</i>

01:05:54.382 --> 01:05:55.981
Thank you, thank you.
Watch this.

01:06:00.321 --> 01:06:01.821
Cook it, Tyler!

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:04.023
Two hours left!
Two hours.

01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:07.029
<i>Those ribs are in the smokers,
and getting very tender.</i>

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:09.313
<i>We got a lot of slow cooking
going on.</i>

01:06:10.651 --> 01:06:12.977
<i>And it looks like we're down
to the thirty minute mark.</i>

01:06:13.038 --> 01:06:15.074
<i>Chefs, we have half an hour.</i>

01:06:15.864 --> 01:06:17.195
<i>Thirty seconds!</i>

01:06:18.506 --> 01:06:19.907
<i>You've got to be plating now.</i>

01:06:20.666 --> 01:06:25.411
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

01:06:25.446 --> 01:06:30.249
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

01:06:30.284 --> 01:06:31.750
<i>Step away from your dishes!</i>

01:06:36.224 --> 01:06:37.530
Go, Mom!

01:06:42.728 --> 01:06:46.104
Well, it looks like the judges are in
the final stages of their deliberation.

01:06:46.139 --> 01:06:48.085
I'd like to take this moment
to tell you that...

01:06:48.086 --> 01:06:50.369
...the next round is going to be
a little bit different.

01:06:50.933 --> 01:06:55.464
The two finalists will be cooking
a dinner of barbecue brisket off site,

01:06:55.499 --> 01:06:59.490
along with sides for ten
pre-selected, local tasters,

01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:01.981
and they will be making
the final decision.

01:07:02.149 --> 01:07:05.482
And it looks like we have our
decision for the semi-finalist.

01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:14.906
And it's unanimous.

01:07:15.129 --> 01:07:17.207
<i>And the chef who will be
moving onto the final round,</i>

01:07:17.231 --> 01:07:18.999
and who will be competing
against Chef Corey Turner,

01:07:19.067 --> 01:07:20.733
is Chef Tyler Dawson!

01:07:29.877 --> 01:07:31.377
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

01:07:31.445 --> 01:07:32.445
Thank you!

01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:39.151
- I knew this was going to happen.
- You did?

01:07:39.186 --> 01:07:43.122
- I got my work cut out for me.
- Yes, you do.

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:53.078
This is so yummy.

01:07:53.622 --> 01:07:55.768
It's always better the next day.

01:07:55.803 --> 01:07:58.037
Would you say this is
the best birthday cake ever?

01:07:58.072 --> 01:07:59.371
Best birthday ever!

01:08:00.408 --> 01:08:01.785
I didn't know so many people
would come.

01:08:01.815 --> 01:08:04.768
And see, you were so worried
about making new friends at camp.

01:08:04.803 --> 01:08:09.014
You took a risk, and it paid off.
Really proud of you.

01:08:11.686 --> 01:08:13.510
Do we have to go?

01:08:14.422 --> 01:08:15.688
What do you mean?

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:19.216
I mean, do we have to go
back to San Francisco?

01:08:20.533 --> 01:08:22.027
We'll see.

01:08:29.002 --> 01:08:30.781
There you are.

01:08:31.973 --> 01:08:34.773
I really miss the old swing
that used to hang over there.

01:08:34.809 --> 01:08:39.979
Yeah. Remember how you used
to make me push you so high?

01:08:40.014 --> 01:08:41.380
You were fearless.

01:08:42.049 --> 01:08:43.402
Was I?

01:08:43.403 --> 01:08:46.755
It's crazy how life
changes that in people.

01:08:47.287 --> 01:08:48.953
Well, it can if you let it.

01:08:52.593 --> 01:08:54.493
What if I lose tomorrow?

01:08:54.562 --> 01:08:59.163
Sweetheart. For starters,
you are not going to lose.

01:08:59.233 --> 01:09:01.100
And it wouldn't matter
if you did.

01:09:01.135 --> 01:09:03.602
I only care if you're happy.

01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:05.938
Thanks. I'm working on it.

01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:07.973
Knock knock!

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:10.376
- Hi, George.
- What are you doing here?

01:09:10.411 --> 01:09:13.912
Just thought I'd check and see if you
all wanted to go to the festival dance.

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:19.118
Well, Tyler, why don't you go?
I'll look after Rosie for you.

01:09:19.185 --> 01:09:21.153
- Are you sure?
- Of course!

01:09:21.188 --> 01:09:23.033
Okay, well, that sounds fun!
Just let me get changed.

01:09:23.057 --> 01:09:26.191
- I'll be right back.
- Sounds good.

01:09:36.237 --> 01:09:38.381
Hey, buddy. I'm meeting Sofia
down at the festival.

01:09:38.406 --> 01:09:39.714
You coming with?

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:42.508
Sure.

01:09:42.894 --> 01:09:44.292
Sure?

01:09:47.014 --> 01:09:49.794
Alright, what's wrong?

01:09:49.817 --> 01:09:52.126
Nothing. It's ridiculous.

01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:57.122
You're thinking about Tyler,
aren't you?

01:09:57.358 --> 01:09:59.658
Jay, I haven't seen her
in fifteen years,

01:09:59.693 --> 01:10:01.960
and now I can't get her
out of my head.

01:10:01.996 --> 01:10:04.630
Well, what did you think
was going to happen?

01:10:04.865 --> 01:10:07.032
I don't know. I don't know
what was going to happen.

01:10:07.101 --> 01:10:10.135
I didn't expect her to be here.
I didn't even think about it.

01:10:10.171 --> 01:10:13.238
I may not be the best person
to give relationship advice,

01:10:13.274 --> 01:10:16.475
but what I do know is that you two
were crazy about each other

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:18.844
all those years ago.

01:10:19.513 --> 01:10:24.249
And from what I can tell...
Yeah, I think you still are.

01:10:24.285 --> 01:10:25.984
Exactly.

01:10:26.053 --> 01:10:30.155
And I don't want to go back to New
York until I know how she feels.

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:32.458
Alright, then.

01:10:32.493 --> 01:10:35.327
You can make fun
of my two step.

01:10:35.362 --> 01:10:36.362
Thanks, man.

01:10:48.242 --> 01:10:50.809
Now, let's show them
how it's done, huh?

01:11:04.658 --> 01:11:06.158
You can take the girl
out of Texas,

01:11:06.193 --> 01:11:08.427
but you can't take
the Texas out of the girl.

01:11:09.196 --> 01:11:10.196
Won't argue with that!

01:11:15.869 --> 01:11:18.237
Can you excuse me
for just one minute?

01:11:18.305 --> 01:11:20.572
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
- Okay, thanks.

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:23.566
Eleven years of knowing you.

01:11:23.567 --> 01:11:26.178
How did I not know
you could dance like that?

01:11:26.213 --> 01:11:27.713
Well, it's all about
your partner.

01:11:30.718 --> 01:11:32.251
You look happy, Tyler.

01:11:33.721 --> 01:11:36.355
I am.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:41.426
Which is why I can't accept
the position you've offered me.

01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:44.396
- I figured as much.
- You did?

01:11:44.465 --> 01:11:48.734
Yeah. You just seem different.

01:11:48.802 --> 01:11:50.802
I thought that job was
everything I ever wanted,

01:11:50.838 --> 01:11:52.972
but it's just not anymore.

01:11:53.702 --> 01:11:56.256
I would really like for Rosie and I

01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:59.144
to stay here in Red Rock
and give it a try.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:03.315
She loves it here, and I think
it'd be really good for her.

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:04.583
For both of us.

01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:08.848
But it's something we both
have to agree on, so...

01:12:08.883 --> 01:12:12.168
Rosie means the world to me,
but if this is what's best for her,

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:15.768
and I'm pretty sure that it might be,
then you have my blessing.

01:12:15.829 --> 01:12:17.496
Thank you.

01:12:17.531 --> 01:12:19.398
So, I'll fly back
as much as I can.

01:12:19.467 --> 01:12:21.484
That said, I've got to catch a flight.

01:12:21.485 --> 01:12:24.603
- I'll see Rosie before I leave.
- Sounds good.

01:12:25.473 --> 01:12:26.539
Thank you.

01:12:26.571 --> 01:12:29.390
And good luck tomorrow
at the final. I'm proud of you.

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:31.621
Man, whoever put
this festival together...

01:12:31.645 --> 01:12:32.978
Yeah, sure nailed it.

01:12:33.047 --> 01:12:35.747
Come on, show this city girl
how it's done down south.

01:12:35.783 --> 01:12:36.915
Don't mind if I do.

01:12:40.178 --> 01:12:42.235
So, it's fast, fast, slow, slow.

01:12:46.193 --> 01:12:48.227
I know I'm the competition.

01:12:50.598 --> 01:12:53.165
But may I have this dance?

01:12:54.796 --> 01:12:56.170
Lead the way.

01:13:02.877 --> 01:13:04.257
You ready for tomorrow?

01:13:04.292 --> 01:13:06.511
Mostly. I still got a lot
of prep work to do.

01:13:06.547 --> 01:13:07.547
Same.

01:13:07.615 --> 01:13:08.875
It's probably going to be
a long night,

01:13:08.883 --> 01:13:11.461
so I figured a little calm
before the storm wouldn't hurt.

01:13:11.485 --> 01:13:12.851
Well, I'm glad you came.

01:13:17.224 --> 01:13:20.659
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you, Mister Turner.

01:13:44.552 --> 01:13:46.152
There's something
I should tell you.

01:13:48.122 --> 01:13:50.811
I'm not going to take
that job in San Francisco.

01:13:52.092 --> 01:13:53.458
Really?

01:13:53.494 --> 01:13:55.969
Rosie and I are going
to stay here for a while.

01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:02.772
That's really great news.

01:14:03.704 --> 01:14:04.830
Is it?

01:14:05.539 --> 01:14:07.525
<i>Have your plans changed, too?</i>

01:14:07.942 --> 01:14:10.324
There's actually something
I want to talk to you about.

01:14:10.812 --> 01:14:13.779
Tyler! There's a fire
at the restaurant.

01:14:13.847 --> 01:14:15.548
- A fire?
- Yeah! Come on! Come on!

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.919
<i>So, it looks like the source
of the fire is the smoker,</i>

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.858
and then it spread to part
of the kitchen in there.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.885
There's some obvious
smoke damage,

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.497
and we're going to need
to replace some of your electrical.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:33.232
That smoker's, well, cooked.
No pun intended.

01:14:33.467 --> 01:14:34.718
At the end of the day,

01:14:34.719 --> 01:14:37.970
...you're going to need about
a month before you can reopen.

01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:41.040
Okay. Thanks, Bill.
My mom's inside.

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:42.942
She wants to see you
before you go.

01:14:42.977 --> 01:14:43.742
Okay.

01:14:43.778 --> 01:14:45.411
<i>Thank you, guys.</i>

01:14:47.481 --> 01:14:49.281
It could have been a lot worse.

01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:50.828
No one got hurt,
the restaurant's fine.

01:14:50.852 --> 01:14:53.152
You got lucky.

01:14:54.989 --> 01:14:57.089
What am I going to do now?

01:15:05.733 --> 01:15:07.132
What did the insurance
company say?

01:15:07.201 --> 01:15:09.301
Well, it looks like they're
going to cover us,

01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.370
so we'll probably be fine.

01:15:11.405 --> 01:15:13.157
That's great news.

01:15:14.442 --> 01:15:17.076
But honey.
The cook off.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.814
Yeah. I don't know how I'm going
to cook a meal for ten people

01:15:21.882 --> 01:15:24.216
by tomorrow without a smoker.

01:15:25.052 --> 01:15:27.193
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

01:15:27.309 --> 01:15:29.254
Maybe I should just
throw in the towel.

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:32.558
No. Things have a way
of working themselves out.

01:15:32.593 --> 01:15:33.593
You'll see.

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:45.104
I know it's late, I was just
thinking about you.

01:15:45.172 --> 01:15:47.272
I just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

01:15:50.559 --> 01:15:53.992
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, you know, it will be.

01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:58.517
I just have a lot on my mind.

01:15:58.552 --> 01:16:01.864
Yeah. Well, is there anything
I can do?

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:06.776
If you want to come and use
that kitchen over the loft,

01:16:06.777 --> 01:16:09.027
you're more than welcome
to do that.

01:16:09.764 --> 01:16:14.366
I think maybe I turned down
Eddie's job offer too soon.

01:16:14.435 --> 01:16:18.134
And maybe all of this,
the fire, the smoker,

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.806
...maybe it's a sign.

01:16:20.841 --> 01:16:23.509
A sign of what?

01:16:24.712 --> 01:16:26.814
That I'm fooling myself.

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:31.650
That we're fooling ourselves.

01:16:33.754 --> 01:16:35.988
I mean, my whole life
is in San Francisco,

01:16:36.023 --> 01:16:37.656
you're whole life
is in New York.

01:16:37.725 --> 01:16:39.992
Tyler.

01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:51.083
Up until about a week ago,
I thought I had a pretty perfect life.

01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:56.218
I thought I had everything
I had ever dreamed of.

01:17:01.215 --> 01:17:03.039
And then I saw you again.

01:17:06.053 --> 01:17:11.439
And I met Rosie, and now...

01:17:13.318 --> 01:17:17.095
...I can't imagine what my life
would look like without you guys in it.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.733
It's not going to work, Corey.

01:18:08.649 --> 01:18:13.071
So, I just wanted to
apologize about earlier.

01:18:13.187 --> 01:18:15.287
I was confused,
and upset, and...

01:18:15.322 --> 01:18:16.154
Tyler.

01:18:16.223 --> 01:18:20.125
- And you deserve better from me.
- That's fine.

01:18:20.194 --> 01:18:21.653
It's not fine.

01:18:22.789 --> 01:18:26.300
And I wanted you to know
that even though we're competitors,

01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:29.241
I'd like us to work
side by side tonight.

01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:31.022
I'm glad to hear that.

01:18:31.428 --> 01:18:32.491
Good.

01:18:34.008 --> 01:18:38.577
So, we have twelve hours
to make two meals for ten people.

01:18:40.014 --> 01:18:41.514
Are you with me?

01:18:41.549 --> 01:18:44.216
- What do you think?
- Let's get to work!

01:19:45.012 --> 01:19:46.251
You're busted!

01:19:53.187 --> 01:19:54.453
You're going down.

01:19:55.568 --> 01:19:56.855
We'll see about that.

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.124
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see.

01:20:02.496 --> 01:20:03.696
<i>Alright, you're out.</i>

01:20:03.731 --> 01:20:06.732
- Alright, I got that. I got that.
- Thank you.

01:20:07.341 --> 01:20:09.602
Look at the time.
We're going to be late.

01:20:15.309 --> 01:20:17.226
She has been gone all night!

01:20:18.417 --> 01:20:20.880
I've been calling, and calling her,
but she's not picking up.

01:20:20.915 --> 01:20:23.182
Don't worry, they'll be here.
Believe you me.

01:20:23.217 --> 01:20:24.817
<i>I think I see them!</i>

01:20:24.852 --> 01:20:27.987
Yes, ladies and gentlemen!
Our finalists have arrived.

01:20:32.193 --> 01:20:33.859
There!

01:20:33.928 --> 01:20:36.128
Thanks, guys! You only took
five years off my life.

01:20:36.163 --> 01:20:36.762
Sorry.

01:20:36.797 --> 01:20:39.198
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:40.366
As ready as I'll ever be.

01:20:40.434 --> 01:20:42.134
Alright, well, break a leg,
or break a rib,

01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:43.802
I don't know.
Whatever you guys say.

01:20:43.838 --> 01:20:45.504
I love you.

01:20:45.539 --> 01:20:48.073
- Thanks, Jay.
- Okay.

01:20:50.144 --> 01:20:53.679
Well, now you decide
whose dish is best,

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:55.068
Corey Turner's,
or Tyler Dawson's!

01:21:05.893 --> 01:21:08.560
I mixed some of Dad's recipe
with my own.

01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:10.062
You did?

01:21:10.097 --> 01:21:11.897
Thought it might
bring me some luck.

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:14.433
Sweetheart, it will.

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:17.469
Sofia, hey.

01:21:17.538 --> 01:21:19.605
Hey, all packed and ready
to fly out after this?

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.206
We need to talk.

01:21:21.242 --> 01:21:24.376
Well, nothing good ever comes
after a line like that.

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:27.913
I've decided to make Red Rock
my home base for a little while.

01:21:28.249 --> 01:21:29.915
Like, a while meaning?

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:31.801
Like indefinitely.

01:21:31.802 --> 01:21:33.569
Obviously I'm still going
to run the businesses,

01:21:33.604 --> 01:21:35.126
and get back to New York
when I need to,

01:21:35.161 --> 01:21:38.157
...but this town's
where I want to hang my hat.

01:21:38.192 --> 01:21:39.825
So, no TV show then?

01:21:40.728 --> 01:21:42.995
You know, this may be
your last shot?

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:48.500
I know. But I need to follow
my gut on this one.

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.235
Well, I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

01:21:50.304 --> 01:21:53.572
- We put a lot of work into this.
- I know.

01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:56.308
But honestly, after seeing how
different you are around here,

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:59.812
I think I understand.

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:03.148
And you're right. This place
certainly does grow on you.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:05.551
And besides, I'm still your
manager, so a few trips

01:22:05.619 --> 01:22:08.020
every year back here to
check up on you won't kill me.

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.488
Sounds good.

01:22:11.659 --> 01:22:15.548
- It was great meeting you, Tyler.
- You have to leave already?

01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:16.628
Yeah, I've got a bunch
of meetings tomorrow,

01:22:16.664 --> 01:22:18.647
so I've got to catch the last
flight out of Dallas,

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.667
but I have no doubt
we'll be meeting again.

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:22.935
Bye, everyone!

01:22:23.337 --> 01:22:25.170
- Call you later.
- Okay.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.640
Is everything okay?

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:30.806
And we have a winner!

01:22:30.872 --> 01:22:33.285
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to announce

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:38.363
the winner of the 30th Annual
Red Rock Barbecue Cook Off...

01:22:40.554 --> 01:22:41.720
Tyler Dawson!

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:53.266
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:22:57.338 --> 01:22:59.671
Shall we give this
another chance?

01:22:59.707 --> 01:23:02.041
I was just thinking
the same thing.

01:23:15.389 --> 01:23:18.157
And he insisted on calling it
Chef Tyler's famous recipe.

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:22.895
<i>Okay, let's do it, huh?
Should we do this!</i>

01:23:23.179 --> 01:23:24.399
Rosie, come on.

01:23:24.865 --> 01:23:25.865
Here, you do it.

01:23:26.087 --> 01:23:27.239
Got it?

01:23:34.641 --> 01:23:35.874
Nice.

01:23:40.981 --> 01:23:42.450
Good job.
