00:05.273 --> 00:07.041
[Payson] This season on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.075 --> 00:09.077
What are you waiting for?
You can do this.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.582
I have something to tell you.
I'm scared of gymnastics.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.550
But I'm the National Champ.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.187
Don't you get it, Kaylie?
Your reign is over.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.089
[Sasha] In three days,
we go up against China.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.324
They're considered to be
the best team in the world.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.326
I'd like to sing
this song for Emily.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.362
- He doesn't sing in public.
- I'm sorry.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.531
[Emily]
I can't talk to you, Damon.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.067
Don't call me. Don't contact me.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.568
And don't come
to the Invitational.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.071
I think it's best
if we stop dating.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.640
I want you to be happy.
I love you both.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.546
[up-tempo music plays]

00:45.579 --> 00:47.181
* This a big one right here

00:47.215 --> 00:51.552
Lauren, you had one of the worst
performances of your career last
month in Beijing.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.522
What happened? And can you
turn it around tomorrow?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.357
I guess I can
tell you guys now...

00:56.390 --> 00:59.493
I was competing with a
severe case of the stomach flu.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.496
I am here with Sara Columbo,
Rock Team member.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.500
- Sara, are you nervous?
- I'm, um, Emily Kmetko.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.602
- Who?
- Everyone knows,

01:08.636 --> 01:10.504
no American gymnast,
not even the healthy ones,

01:10.538 --> 01:12.406
medaled on beam
against China.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.109
But tomorrow
I will be the first.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.511
Emily Kmetko.
I'm on the National Team.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.548
[speaking foreign language]

01:20.581 --> 01:22.216
My back's a hundred percent

01:22.250 --> 01:23.917
but I'm not up
to competition level yet.

01:23.951 --> 01:27.621
So although I won't be competing
tomorrow, I'll be on the floor
supporting my teammates.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.524
- Any plans for Nationals
next year?
- Just to win it.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.394
Yes, we know who you are.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.230
You are the one everyone
thinks doesn't belong.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.399
Yeah.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.601
Hey. The Chinese
will be here any minute

01:40.634 --> 01:42.203
and Kaylie's
still not here.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.572
She told me last night
she was doing the meet.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.640
- Could something have
changed her mind...?
- She'll be here.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.142
OK.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.577
[M.J.] You're doing
the right thing, Kaylie.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.513
This is a non-sanctioned meet.
You're under no obligation

01:52.546 --> 01:55.616
to lose your status or your
endorsements just to have
the backs of your teammates.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.251
Especially when
the only thing

01:57.285 --> 01:59.553
they have in my back
is a knife.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.155
Well, not all of them.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.891
This is ultimately an individual
quest for the Gold.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.160
Your teammates may act
like your friends,

02:06.194 --> 02:08.529
but everyone is looking
out for number one.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.563
You should do the same.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.931
Funny, that's what
my dad said.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.900
Wow. For once we agree.

02:12.933 --> 02:16.304
- Where is your father?
- Taking his own advice.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.572
Well, the National Committee
and I have your back.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.341
I wonder what
the Chinese will do

02:20.374 --> 02:22.510
when they find out they came
all the way to Boulder

02:22.543 --> 02:24.912
and the US National Champion
isn't even gonna compete?

02:24.945 --> 02:27.715
That's not your problem.
I want you to lay low.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.184
Don't answer the phone. I don't
want you talking to the press

02:30.218 --> 02:31.585
or your friends
until this blows over.

02:31.619 --> 02:35.223
You don't owe anyone
an explanation. OK?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.326
Ladies, remember,

02:38.359 --> 02:40.561
the Chinese prefer
to shake hands very lightly

02:40.594 --> 02:43.597
and they lower their eyes
as a symbol of respect.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.267
Let's do the same
so we don't appear rude.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.601
Talk about rude,
the National Champion

02:47.635 --> 02:49.337
isn't even here
to greet them.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.573
Yeah, I know. Where is Kaylie?
I can't believe she's late.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.174
[pop music playing]

03:02.383 --> 03:03.617
There's Genji Cho!

03:05.253 --> 03:07.388
That's Genji Cho?
She looks like a kid.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.290
Don't be fooled,
they're machines.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.625
They take them away from their
parents and the little gymbots

03:11.659 --> 03:14.628
are practically forced to do
gymnastics around the clock,

03:14.662 --> 03:17.231
every single day.
It's all they know.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.566
[whispering] Let's go!

03:22.670 --> 03:25.539
- Are we still sure
Kaylie's coming?
- Yeah.

03:25.573 --> 03:29.610
It's all over, Belov.
Kaylie's not doing the meet.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.445
I'm glad I'm here
to see you cancel

03:31.479 --> 03:33.247
this little ego trip
of yours.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.683
Your girls would've
been decimated anyway.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.726
Excuse me. I have
an announcement to make.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.729
I've just been told
that Kaylie Cruz

03:48.762 --> 03:50.664
will not be competing
in the meet tomorrow.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.633
- [indistinct murmuring]
- [Sasha] So...

03:52.666 --> 03:58.038
...as a result, Rachel Colter
will be competing in her place.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.442
- [indistinct chatter]
- Coach, do you feel this
will affect your chances?

04:01.475 --> 04:03.411
And now,
I'd like to introduce

04:03.444 --> 04:05.379
Coach Kai-Yung Tseng
and his honorable team

04:05.413 --> 04:07.815
to Boulder and to The Rock.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.817
[light applause]

04:15.556 --> 04:17.458
We did not travel
7,000 miles

04:17.491 --> 04:19.827
to compete against
your second string, Mr. Belov.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.829
Even without Kaylie Cruz,

04:21.862 --> 04:25.333
I assure you, this team will
give you a fight.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.669
And I assure you,
we will bury your team.

04:28.702 --> 04:32.340
And then,
I will bury you.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.498
[Carter] She's probably wigged
about the Invitational tomorrow.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.733
- Give her a little time.
- That's just it,
I don't have time.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.670
The prize for the contest
is a European tour.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.705
And I leave tomorrow,
after the radio show.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.107
- For how long?
- Six months.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.879
But I can't leave without
trying to work this out
or saying goodbye.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.482
But she said she didn't want
to see me or talk to me,

05:14.515 --> 05:16.083
and I have to
respect that, right?

05:16.116 --> 05:18.519
I've been dying to text her
and call her all day,

05:18.552 --> 05:19.753
but she's got a
huge day tomorrow,

05:19.787 --> 05:20.888
I don't want to get
in the way.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.590
But she might feel differently
if she knew

05:22.623 --> 05:26.427
you were leaving the country
tomorrow for half a year.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.397
How about a letter?
You can pin it by her paycheck.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.632
She's coming by later
to pick it up.

05:31.665 --> 05:36.136
That's good. I can write down
how I feel and what's going down

05:36.169 --> 05:38.639
and she can decide what
she wants to do without
any pressure.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.741
And if you want my opinion,

05:40.774 --> 05:42.643
now's not the time
to hold anything back.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.478
Yeah, I can give you
the same advice.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.514
[chuckling]

05:46.547 --> 05:48.416
[indie rock music plays]

05:49.650 --> 05:51.719
[knocking on door]

05:54.187 --> 05:56.490
No! You have to hear us out.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.792
- Get her and get out.
- Please, Kaylie.
You gotta let us explain.

05:58.826 --> 06:02.430
Explain what?
That you've been sneaking up
to Lauren's garage apartment

06:02.463 --> 06:05.165
- to have sex this whole time?
- He was just living up there.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.534
That's all.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.935
You've been living
at Lauren's?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.704
- My dad kicked me out.
- He was living in his car.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.875
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What would you have done?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.777
You didn't care when Carter
got kicked out of the gym

06:16.810 --> 06:19.179
and couldn't compete at
Nationals, all to save
your career.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.582
Why would you care
if he was homeless?

06:21.615 --> 06:25.453
I let you back into my life
under one condition:

06:25.486 --> 06:29.923
that you'd have nothing to do
with Carter! And you lied to me.

06:29.957 --> 06:33.627
Again. But then why
does that surprise me?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.663
- You're nothing but...
- That's enough!

06:35.696 --> 06:39.166
Seriously, Kaylie. She was being
a friend when I had no one.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.536
And you shouldn't use this
to pull out of the China meet.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.639
- You're defending her?
- Please, Kaylie. We need you.

06:45.673 --> 06:49.777
No. You only need me because
you'll do better with me

06:49.810 --> 06:51.679
than without me.
But guess what?

06:51.712 --> 06:55.015
This time I'm
looking out for myself.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.853
We're done here.
Let's go.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.791
Please, Kaylie.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.827
- You've gotta believe me.
- Goodbye, Carter.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.577
[grunting]

07:25.679 --> 07:27.848
Her people are telling her
to stay away from The Rock.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.685
[sighing] I'm glad her loyalty
is with her "people," then.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.987
She respects you, Emily.
As a teammate and a friend.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.556
She doesn't want
to let you down

07:35.589 --> 07:36.990
but she thinks she's got
too much to lose

07:37.024 --> 07:38.626
- if she competes.
- [scoffing]

07:38.659 --> 07:40.761
That's what she
told me to tell you.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.031
Do you know what I'm losing?
My scholarship.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.968
- Almost half of
my family's income.
- Man, that's awful.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.838
- What happened?
- The National Committee
found out I have a job.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.006
What are you gonna do?

07:53.040 --> 07:55.743
I don't know. I don't know
how we're going to make it.

07:55.776 --> 07:59.046
But, I've come too far
to be passed over.

07:59.079 --> 08:03.917
Gymnastics is my life and
I'm not gonna let anyone...

08:03.951 --> 08:05.919
...or anything get in my way.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.655
Damon?

08:07.688 --> 08:10.891
I should never have been seeing
anybody in the first place.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.960
Where is my mother?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.664
Do you need a ride home?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.634
I came to ask you a favor.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.303
Because of my mistake,
my husband is AWOL

08:23.336 --> 08:25.973
and Kaylie is
in a terrible place.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.875
Of course,
she doesn't want to listen

08:27.908 --> 08:29.877
to anything
I have to say, but...

08:29.910 --> 08:33.080
- I think she's getting
some bad advice.
- So do I.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.083
So, could you please
come and talk to her?

08:36.116 --> 08:39.319
I think I've said everything
I could to her, Mrs. Cruz.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.989
Please? We need you.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.025
Right now, you're
the only man in her life.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.896
- You're it.
- [sighing]

08:48.929 --> 08:51.732
[rock music plays]

08:52.900 --> 08:55.703
Hey, Carlos.
This is my friend Leo.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.070
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.840
I just gotta grab some
stuff from my locker.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.091
- OK.
- Ready?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.794
Yeah,
I just have to get my check.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.796
All right. Ready.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.073
Belov.
What do you want?

09:33.106 --> 09:35.042
I want you to go home
and talk to your daughter.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.778
You want her to compete, you
talk to her. You're the coach.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.681
And you're the father. You're
the one she needs right now.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.783
So why don't you wrap up
this little pity party

09:42.816 --> 09:45.118
you've been throwing for
yourself and act like a father.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.858
[sighing]

10:00.868 --> 10:02.636
[indistinct chattering]

10:05.739 --> 10:08.041
This is exciting.
It's really happening.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.811
- Yeah, we did it.
- You did it.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.046
I do have a question about
the scoreboard, though...

10:13.080 --> 10:16.083
- What about it?
- China's our opponent.
Not the National Committee.

10:16.116 --> 10:20.087
- Ellen Beals will go ballistic.
- And the problem is...?

10:22.222 --> 10:26.093
I have to admit.
Going rogue is kind of fun.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.864
I think I'm gonna
go back to my old landing.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.933
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10:32.966 --> 10:37.404
I can do that one perfectly.
This thing is stressful enough,

10:37.437 --> 10:39.006
I just don't think
it's a good idea to go too far

10:39.039 --> 10:40.774
out of my comfort zone.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.745
I can't believe
Kaylie bailed.

10:44.778 --> 10:48.215
I'd feel so much better
if you were competing.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.750
I'm not ready.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.754
Can I tell you a secret?

10:53.787 --> 10:57.457
I still can't go on bars.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.127
I tried, but since I got hurt
I haven't been able

11:00.160 --> 11:03.931
- to touch them.
- You will.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.000
Can I tell you a secret?

11:07.868 --> 11:10.904
[inhales]
The other night,

11:10.938 --> 11:14.041
I said "I love you"
to someone for the first time.

11:14.074 --> 11:18.946
Wow! Talk about going
out of your comfort zone.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.248
If you can do that, I mean,
this should be...

11:21.281 --> 11:24.284
- ...I'm just sayin'.
- [chuckling]

11:29.222 --> 11:31.859
So, your husband won't
be joining us?

11:31.892 --> 11:36.263
He wanted to, but
he got called out of town.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.967
- Business.
- In that case,
I'll just get to it.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.772
- Oh, look! You're back!
- Sorry, everyone.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.273
Hope I didn't miss anything.
Hey, kiddo.

11:46.306 --> 11:50.878
- Hi!
- So, what's this all about?

11:50.911 --> 11:54.514
Just a long-overdue visit.
I realized I'd never told

11:54.547 --> 11:56.784
you and your wife
how much all of us

11:56.817 --> 11:59.052
on the National Committee
appreciate Kaylie.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.990
She's a real asset. To both her
country and her team.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.859
If I was such an asset,
why didn't I go to Beijing?

12:05.893 --> 12:08.195
Because Beijing
was unwinnable.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.064
It was in everyone's best
interest to protect you.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.134
You understand, I'm sure, Alex,
as you were a star athlete.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.303
- You have to pick your battles.
- Hm-hm.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.773
The world needs to see you
as a winner, Kaylie.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.108
You couldn't
have won in China.

12:21.141 --> 12:24.144
I wish your coach understood
that, but he doesn't.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.280
We're the ones who have your
back here, not Coach Belov.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.884
- We all appreciate it.
- You're lucky to have
Alex as a dad.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.786
You don't get to be
a major league phenomenon

12:32.820 --> 12:34.087
like your father
unless you understand

12:34.121 --> 12:36.556
how the game is played.
On and off the field.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.059
Thanks for coming by,
Ms. Beals.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.194
It's a great comfort
knowing that Kaylie

12:41.228 --> 12:43.230
has someone looking
out for her.

12:49.837 --> 12:50.838
What a pompous ass.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.206
Who does she think she is,
coming into my home

12:53.240 --> 12:54.908
telling us that
you're not good enough

12:54.942 --> 12:56.877
to win a Gold medal
against the Chinese?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.078
Why aren't you competing today?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.047
The National Committee
doesn't want me to,

13:00.080 --> 13:03.951
and my sponsors and my manager
are freaked out,

13:03.984 --> 13:07.154
and I don't trust...
certain members of my team.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.923
You're a gymnast.
An elite athlete.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.091
None of those are reasons

13:11.124 --> 13:12.960
why you shouldn't go
out there and do

13:12.993 --> 13:17.364
what you're born to do.
So, what's really stopping you?

13:17.397 --> 13:20.600
- No one thinks I can win.
- What do you think?

13:20.633 --> 13:24.137
- I think they're right.
- [Ronnie] Kaylie...

13:24.171 --> 13:27.841
Nationals was supposed to be
this huge validation for me,

13:27.875 --> 13:29.376
but practically
the second I won,

13:29.409 --> 13:32.112
everybody was saying
that it a fluke.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.247
And ever since the day
I got the title?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.583
I've been terrified
of the day

13:36.616 --> 13:40.053
that I have to prove
it wasn't a fluke.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.122
So, what,
you're gonna just run away?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.224
Quit gymnastics altogether?

13:45.926 --> 13:48.395
I can't.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.163
I was born to do this.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.135
Then go do it. You're gonna
have to face that fear someday,

13:55.168 --> 13:57.137
it might as well be today.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.047
[dance music plays]

14:07.080 --> 14:09.983
Here they are,
the Chinese National Team.

14:10.017 --> 14:14.154
The best in the world,
and some say, ever assembled.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.197
[applause]

14:34.174 --> 14:36.076
[male announcer] And here
come the young women

14:36.109 --> 14:38.378
from the Rocky Mountain
Gymnastics Training Center.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.181
Perhaps the gutsiest
team ever assembled.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.151
[female announcer] Some people
are calling them the craziest.

14:44.184 --> 14:48.155
To do this meet, especially
without Kaylie Cruz?

14:49.356 --> 14:52.192
You girls look nervous!
I will give you one thing.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.162
When you decide to go down
in flames, you girls go big.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.065
[male announcer]
Let the games begin.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.101
[speaking in Chinese]

15:03.236 --> 15:05.338
Do you know why younger
gymnasts have an advantage

15:05.372 --> 15:07.140
over older gymnasts?

15:07.174 --> 15:10.177
It's not because they're
more flexible or stronger.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.678
It's because they're
more fearless.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.347
- But I believe that...
- [audience cheering]

15:14.381 --> 15:15.515
[audience murmuring]

15:18.518 --> 15:20.988
[male announcer] Things are
getting very interesting here.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.223
It looks like
National Champ Kaylie Cruz

15:23.256 --> 15:25.192
is back in the line-up
for The Rock.

15:25.225 --> 15:29.129
- Kaylie, we had a deal.
- My daughter doesn't make deals
with the devil.

15:36.403 --> 15:40.107
Coach Belov?
I want to compete today.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.109
I think we can arrange that.

15:42.142 --> 15:47.147
And I'd like to talk to my team,
if that's OK with you?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.481
You are the team leader.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.387
[female announcer]
It looks like Kaylie Cruz,

15:54.421 --> 15:57.457
the team captain, wants to
give her team the pep talk.

15:57.490 --> 16:01.461
You want to know the real
reason I disappeared?

16:03.430 --> 16:06.066
I was afraid.

16:06.099 --> 16:11.004
I was afraid that I was going
to come out here and choke,

16:11.038 --> 16:15.075
and that my National win
really was a fluke.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.145
I know you guys are afraid, too.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.214
But we each have something
bigger than our fear.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.749
We have each other.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.352
Not sure what Kaylie is telling
her teammates right now,

16:25.385 --> 16:27.754
but they look like
they're getting fired up.

16:27.787 --> 16:31.258
Guys, we're more than a team.
We're a family.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.760
Those girls out there aren't
allowed to have lives,

16:33.793 --> 16:37.030
so they don't
have distractions. We do.

16:37.064 --> 16:40.367
And we have our issues.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.537
With our parents.
With boys.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.574
With each other.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.376
That's part of being a family.

16:51.311 --> 16:55.282
And yeah, we have our fear.
But you know what?

16:55.315 --> 16:59.152
It's OK to have fear because
that means you have passion.

16:59.186 --> 17:03.790
But just for today, we're gonna
leave the fear in here,

17:03.823 --> 17:06.226
and we're gonna take that
passion out there,

17:06.259 --> 17:08.161
onto that floor.

17:08.195 --> 17:12.065
Where this Rock Family is
gonna go, right now,

17:12.099 --> 17:14.201
- and kick some serious ass.
- [all] Yeah!

17:14.234 --> 17:15.835
- [Lauren] Let's do this!
- [Kaylie] Ready?

17:15.868 --> 17:19.139
- One, two, three...

17:22.175 --> 17:23.410

17:23.443 --> 17:26.213
[male announcer]
That's why they call
these girls renegades.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.216
The contrast between these
teams couldn't be clearer.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.552
[female announcer] The first
rotation will be vault and
floor exercise.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.422
The Rock is looking
to get five medals today

17:35.455 --> 17:38.225
to beat the performance of
the National team in Beijing.

are off to an amazing start.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.514
They might as
well stop looking up.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.251
Their names aren't gonna
be on that board all day.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.620

Here she is... Genji Cho.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.290
Americans who have never seen
this athlete compete before

18:10.323 --> 18:14.127
are in for a shock.
She is in a league of her own.

18:14.161 --> 18:17.230
She won every Gold medal
in Beijing last month.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.412

I'm frankly speechless.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.547
A three-and-a-half twist?
Who does that?

18:34.581 --> 18:37.284
That was absolutely
incomparable.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.152
You've got to feel
a little sorry

18:39.186 --> 18:40.119
for Kaylie Cruz right now.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.122

magnitude since Nationals.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.771
She is.
Lauren Tanner is hurt.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.006

24:35.708 --> 24:37.844
Damn it!

24:39.278 --> 24:41.013
[sighing]

24:41.047 --> 24:42.682
You're on bars next.
How do you feel?

24:42.715 --> 24:44.050
I'm fine.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.661
[male announcer] Well, this
is a big problem for The Rock.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.963
With Kaylie Cruz not
medaling on bars,

24:56.996 --> 24:59.632
Sasha Belov needed
Lauren Tanner to do so.

24:59.666 --> 25:03.269
And now it looks like she
may be done for the day.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.071
[female announcer]
Hard to see, given the lineup,

25:05.104 --> 25:06.939
how The Rock can get
that fifth medal now.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.908
His alternate hasn't
even been

25:08.941 --> 25:11.110
in an international
competition before.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.759
Payson.

25:26.793 --> 25:27.927
You're in.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.973
- Me?
- You.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.942
You're cleared to
do gymnastics, let's go.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.712
But I'm working my way back
with simple routines.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.979
It will never
be enough to medal.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.348
Rachel wouldn't medal,
either.

25:49.381 --> 25:53.586
But you will inspire your
team to do the impossible.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.889
Sasha. I haven't been on
the bars since my injury.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.025
I...

25:59.058 --> 26:01.961
I can't. I'm...
I'm so afraid of them.

26:01.994 --> 26:05.932
- You've got this, Pay.
- You can do it, Payson.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.100
Payson, you were here
to help me do this

26:08.134 --> 26:09.969
and now I'm here for you.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.141
Come on.

[male announcer] It's odd to
see the great Payson Keeler

28:19.165 --> 28:21.100
do such a simple routine

28:21.133 --> 28:27.006
but, I've... I've never
seen her look better.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.742
The Rock looks more fired up
than we've ever seen them.

28:59.338 --> 29:02.208
It looks like she will sweep
the Golds here today,

29:02.241 --> 29:04.110
just like she did
in Beijing.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.779

Emily Kmetko is the last
gymnast up on the bars.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.959
She is trying to give The Rock
its fourth medal of the day,

29:19.992 --> 29:23.062
tying the number of medals
won by the National Team
won in Beijing.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.765
Emily Kmetko? Fat chance.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.873
[male announcer] This is a very
high pressure situation

29:33.906 --> 29:35.007
for this young gymnast.

29:35.041 --> 29:37.009
[female announcer] Yeah, this
is where her inexperience

29:37.043 --> 29:38.077
might be a problem for her.

of this situation.

it's safe to say nobody
expected Emily Kmetko

30:41.307 --> 30:42.875
to get a Silver medal on bars.

30:42.909 --> 30:46.412
[female announcer]
She's walking out of here today
with a Silver and a Bronze.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.048
Let's remember, that's as good
as Kelly Parker did

30:49.081 --> 30:50.616
against the Chinese
last month.

30:50.649 --> 30:53.285
[male announcer]
I think this young woman
answered any questions

30:53.319 --> 30:55.888
anyone could have had about
her background,

30:55.922 --> 30:57.289
her training,
or her worth

30:57.323 --> 30:59.158
as a National Team
member today.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.028
And she's also proven that
Sasha Belov was right.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.897
His renegade group here
has just won

31:04.931 --> 31:06.298
as many medals against
the Chinese

as the hand-selected members
of the US National Team.

athlete for The Rock.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.173

31:14.206 --> 31:16.442
The Rock will beat
the US's four medals.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.312
Listen to me carefully,
Kaylie.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.114
I want you to add
a triple twist.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.216
I've seen you
working on it.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.318
- You can do it.
- Why?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.154
We have the four medals.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.023
If I just do my routine clean,
we can probably get our five.

31:31.057 --> 31:34.226
And that would be
wonderful for the team.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.062
But I'm talking
about you, Kaylie.

31:36.095 --> 31:40.232
I'm talking about you going
for the Gold, right now.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.936
- You think I can beat that?
- Yeah, I do.

31:43.970 --> 31:47.206
Prove yourself,
right here, right now.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.309
But if I don't land it,
I might not medal at all.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.078
And we won't
beat the National Team.

31:52.111 --> 31:57.083
But if you do? You're clearly
the best gymnast in America.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.185
And you rival
the very best in the world.

the gymnastic world

34:04.343 --> 34:06.078

34:06.112 --> 34:09.615
And someone at the National Team
has a lot of explaining to do.

These girls clearly should've
been taken to Beijing.

when we stopped by

35:21.553 --> 35:23.255
to pick up your check.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.224
Why would you do that?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.695
To protect you.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.631
You'd just told me
how important it was to focus

35:32.664 --> 35:34.400
and I didn't want anything
to mess with that.

35:34.433 --> 35:38.304

note until after the China meet.

that was your call?

I can't believe this is true,

that you had a phobia

of other people.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.866
to let them in.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.669
Well, I finally did.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.606
I love you Emily,
wherever you are.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.610
And I'm so glad I told you,
and I'm so glad I can say that,

38:31.643 --> 38:34.746
and I can sing it to the world.

38:34.780 --> 38:38.116
Letting go and loving you...

38:38.149 --> 38:43.522
...opened me up,
made me free.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.123
Free enough to do this.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.593
It made me better, too.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.729
[announcer]
You're leaving for a six month
European tour tonight.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.699
Let's give these people a taste
of what they're gonna get.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.834
[Damon] This is for you, Emily.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.470
I thought you would've
come to say goodbye.

38:58.504 --> 39:02.508
I guess you really
are letting me go.

39:02.541 --> 39:07.646
But thank you... for giving me
the guts to fall...

39:09.648 --> 39:14.686
...for opening me up to life.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.390
I will never forget you.

39:20.526 --> 39:24.396
[* Paul Freeman: Tightrope]

39:25.196 --> 39:29.535
* I don't want to wait
too long *

39:29.568 --> 39:34.673
* And I don't want
to break it down *

39:34.706 --> 39:39.611
* The sun is sinking
just like stone *

39:39.645 --> 39:42.981
* And it's hard for me
to breathe *

39:43.882 --> 39:45.784
I have to go say goodbye.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.687
He's gonna think I didn't
care enough to say goodbye.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.522
- Go!
- [Kaylie] Come on,
I'll drive you!

39:50.556 --> 39:52.491
* Fear and the pain

39:52.524 --> 39:55.927
Do what you want.
Love who you want.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.897
* But I'll keep holding

39:58.930 --> 40:00.832
* Holding

40:00.866 --> 40:05.704
* And I'm higher before
than I've ever been *

40:05.737 --> 40:11.643
* I was walking a tightrope
can't you see *

40:11.677 --> 40:15.681
* But nobody wants
to be alone *

40:15.714 --> 40:20.185
* I was walking a tightrope

40:20.218 --> 40:24.990
* Can you catch me?

40:25.023 --> 40:28.527
* If I let go

40:30.228 --> 40:32.931
Well, go! Before
it's too late, go!

40:34.900 --> 40:39.905
* The world is turning out
of time *

40:39.938 --> 40:41.873
Before it's too late.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.810
* Will pull me close

40:44.843 --> 40:47.245
* And it's all I'll ever need

40:47.278 --> 40:48.914
[sighs]

40:48.947 --> 40:52.484
It's me. Um...

40:52.518 --> 40:57.789
I know this is crazy, but,
uh, I love you. I just do.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.891
And I know you're right.
We're meant to be together.

40:59.925 --> 41:04.796
So let's just put the stupid
stuff behind us and be together.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.898
I want you to come
to my room tonight.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.900
I'll be waiting for you.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.468
[cell phone beeps]

41:11.803 --> 41:14.506
* I was walking a tightrope

41:14.540 --> 41:15.974
* Walking a tightrope

41:16.007 --> 41:18.810
* Can you catch me?

41:20.646 --> 41:22.981
* If I let go

41:25.316 --> 41:30.722
[Damon on radio]
* As far as I can see

41:30.756 --> 41:33.825
Isn't this where
Damon Young was just singing?

41:33.859 --> 41:36.662
Is there another studio?

41:36.695 --> 41:38.296
Oh, you must be Emily.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.699
You're in the right place,
but it's the wrong time.

41:40.732 --> 41:43.001
I don't understand.
I was just listening to him.

41:43.034 --> 41:43.969
Yeah, the show's pre-recorded.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.539
His flight left about
an hour ago. I'm sorry.

41:50.709 --> 41:55.547
* Cause all we are
is skin and bones *

41:55.581 --> 42:01.019
* So just keep holding
Just keep holding on *

42:01.052 --> 42:06.024
* And I'm higher before
than I've ever been *

42:06.057 --> 42:09.027
* I was walking a tightrope

42:09.060 --> 42:11.763
* Can't you see?

42:11.797 --> 42:16.668
* Nobody wants to be alone

42:16.702 --> 42:19.905
* I was walking a tightrope

42:19.938 --> 42:21.039
* Walking a tightrope

42:21.072 --> 42:24.743
* Can you catch me?

42:25.877 --> 42:28.914
* If I let go

42:28.947 --> 42:30.982
* There's no way back

42:31.016 --> 42:33.752
* If I let go

42:33.785 --> 42:35.754
* You're where I'll land

42:35.787 --> 42:38.990
* So here I go

42:39.024 --> 42:44.663
* Cause I just want to live

42:44.696 --> 42:48.967
* And I just want to feel it

42:51.637 --> 42:53.171
* Oh

42:54.840 --> 42:57.375
* I just want to feel it

42:57.408 --> 43:01.647
* I'm higher to fall
than I've ever been *

43:01.680 --> 43:06.718
* I was walking a tightrope
Can't you see? *

43:06.752 --> 43:11.857
* That nobody wants
to be alone *

43:11.890 --> 43:15.994
* I was walking a tightrope

43:16.027 --> 43:20.666
* Can you catch me?

43:20.699 --> 43:24.102
* If I let go *
