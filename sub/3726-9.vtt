00:01.760 --> 00:03.660
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.700 --> 00:06.032
He did this to these girls
and then he put it up on a wall

00:06.070 --> 00:08.493
for everyone to see.
He was in this building!

00:08.540 --> 00:10.565
These things are gonna have me
knocked out for a while.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.009
(Lorenzo)
There's a spare key.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.702
Did you get what
you were looking for?

00:14.740 --> 00:15.775
- Lorenzo, I--
- Don't.

00:15.810 --> 00:17.141
They're gonna kill my brother

00:17.180 --> 00:18.545
and I don't really
even know him.

00:18.580 --> 00:21.174
Mrs. DiLaurentis gave money
to the Carissimi Group

00:21.220 --> 00:22.244
to support Charles.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.780
You must be Rhys Matthews.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.118
- 'That guy looks exactly--'
- Like a DiLaurentis.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.457
We had birthday cake

00:27.490 --> 00:29.424
that day at the arcade
when Jason and I met him.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.382
(Alison)
He said it was the best
birthday he ever had.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.058
I've been thinking
about what I want.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.262
(Spencer)
You're friend Clark

00:37.300 --> 00:39.268
he was meeting some guy
named Rhys Matthews.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.733
'He works for
the Carissimi Group'

00:40.770 --> 00:43.034
and we think that he might be
working for Charles.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.259
I'm sure they took
your feelings

00:45.310 --> 00:46.470
into consideration.

00:46.510 --> 00:47.670
And, yes, it sucks

00:47.710 --> 00:48.802
but it came from up high.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.148
What? The police?

00:50.180 --> 00:52.569
- The school board.
- What?

00:52.620 --> 00:54.212
They think your attendance
could endanger

00:54.250 --> 00:55.274
the other students' safety.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.287
And from what I understand

00:56.320 --> 00:57.685
about the gallery situation

00:57.720 --> 00:59.688
I don't completely disagree.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.585
I do.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.848
They can't punish us.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.585
- It's not a punishment.
- Really?

01:04.630 --> 01:06.598
Being disinvited
to your own prom?

01:06.630 --> 01:10.191
- What would you call it?
- 'A blessing.‘

01:10.230 --> 01:12.289
If Charles, A,
whatever he calls himself

01:12.340 --> 01:14.331
was bold enough to pull
that stunt with the photos

01:14.370 --> 01:16.702
he's not gonna be scared
to crash a school party.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.708
Well, then, fill
the ballroom with police.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.469
It's a fairy-tale theme. They
can come as the village idiots.

01:20.510 --> 01:22.205
You can still
celebrate that night

01:22.250 --> 01:24.468
in a quiet,
more intimate way.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.740
Veronica's offered _
to host a small gathering

01:26.780 --> 01:28.179
in the backyard barn.

01:28.220 --> 01:29.448
You're kidding me.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.209
- 'Seriously?‘
- Why not?

01:32.260 --> 01:33.852
Because it's filled
with Melissa's stuff.

01:33.890 --> 01:35.187
How is that a banquet hall?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.450
- You can roll up a rug.
- And what?

01:37.490 --> 01:40.220
Take our prom picture
on top of a washer-dryer?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.129
Hanna, you don't have a choice.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.126
If the school board
doesn't want you at prom

01:45.170 --> 01:46.728
Ol‘ commencement. .

01:46.770 --> 01:48.260
Commencement? Wait.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.234
We were barred from that too?

01:50.270 --> 01:51.362
So now we're not gonna graduate?

01:51.410 --> 01:52.877
(Pam)
You will graduate.

01:52.910 --> 01:54.798
You just won't be walking
across the stage

01:54.840 --> 01:56.376
to get your diploma.
You'll be--

01:56.410 --> 01:58.241
Walking to the mailbox.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.212
Unbelievable.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.877
(Pam)
'I'm sorry.‘

02:00.920 --> 02:02.512
No, I'm sorry.

02:02.550 --> 02:03.744
I've spent the past two weeks

02:03.790 --> 02:05.485
writing that stupid
valedictorian speech

02:05.520 --> 02:07.249
that I didn't even wanna
give In the first place.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.224
Honey, the circumstances
have changed

02:09.260 --> 02:10.659
since you started that speech.

02:10.690 --> 02:14.148
I know. It went from a pity-toss
to a humiliation-hurl.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.363
Please, stop focusing
on what you don't have

02:17.400 --> 02:18.424
and focus on the fact
that you're here

02:18.470 --> 02:21.359
and you have four dear friends
to celebrate with.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.265
That barn is not big enough
for us, our dates

02:23.310 --> 02:24.766
and our poufy dresses.

02:24.810 --> 02:26.300
You'll open a window.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.637
That's what she said?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.375
Oh, no. There was more.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.173
She said something about
hanging twinkly lights

02:31.210 --> 02:32.370
on Melissa's
shower curtain.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.773
But by that time,
I was already

02:33.820 --> 02:35.378
halfway up the stairs.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.308
I guess it could be worse.

02:37.350 --> 02:38.419
Really? How?

02:39.690 --> 02:41.282
I'm thinking.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.429
Ali, are you okay?

02:46.360 --> 02:49.261
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.289
Even if we went to the real prom

02:50.330 --> 02:52.195
who would we hang out with
besides each other?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.389
(Hanna)
'That's true.‘

02:53.440 --> 02:54.464
Everyone would just stare at us

02:54.500 --> 02:56.400
like we were in some fishbowl.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.203
And we wouldn't be safe.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.277
We already know that Charles has
some twisted thing for formals.

03:01.310 --> 03:04.302
We've already been to one
psycho-prom that he hosted.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.319
[pop song on speaker]

03:07.880 --> 03:09.347
Have you spoken to Clark?

03:09.390 --> 03:11.346
No, I've left him,
like, five messages.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.358
Did you mention
who we saw him meet up with?

03:13.390 --> 03:14.812
You didn't give me a name.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.327
What about Charles?

03:16.360 --> 03:17.759
He goes by Rhys.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.838
(Emily)
'Don't sweat it, Ali.
He'll forgive you.'

03:29.870 --> 03:32.304
If it were his brother
on the suspect board

03:32.340 --> 03:34.479
he would have done
the same thing.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.318
I gotta go to the bathroom.

* If one of them is dead *

04:22.460 --> 04:23.825
Could you call me?

04:23.860 --> 04:25.885
I don't know if,
if you went out of town

04:25.930 --> 04:28.023
or if your phone is not
working, but I really

04:28.060 --> 04:29.493
need to talk to you, Clark.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.724
Call me.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.365
Shouldn't the police

04:33.400 --> 04:35.493
be leaving these messages..

04:35.540 --> 04:37.508
...and not you?

04:37.540 --> 04:38.905
Aria, if, if you
and your friends think

04:38.940 --> 04:40.908
that this guy is in any way
connected to Charles--

04:40.940 --> 04:43.374
I thought a lot of my
friends were connected.

04:43.410 --> 04:45.640
Well, just look at what
happened with Andrew Campbell.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.819
He can barely say my name
without spitting.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.711
Mom, what are you doing here?

04:51.750 --> 04:55.379
- Have you checked your emails?
- No, why?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.921
What, am I banned
from here too?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.325
The contest judges

04:58.360 --> 04:59.952
finally saw your work.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.525
You won first prize, Aria.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.468
What does that mean?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.525
It means there's a cash prize

05:05.570 --> 05:07.959
and an internship
waiting for you in LA.

05:09.370 --> 05:10.803
Congratulations!

05:10.840 --> 05:12.933
It starts the Monday
after school ends.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.072
That's fantastic. Right?

05:14.110 --> 05:16.340
Wait, what if the police
haven't caught him by then?

05:16.380 --> 05:18.075
Well, honey, we have to believe

05:18.110 --> 05:19.577
that they're closer
than you think.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.973
Yeah, but what if they're not?

05:21.020 --> 05:24.012
I can't just go
and hop on a plane.

05:24.050 --> 05:25.085
What about my friends?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.759
None of _us can move on
until this thing IS over.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.451
Aria, have-have you
been threatened

05:29.490 --> 05:30.582
by Charles since the gallery?

05:30.630 --> 05:32.359
No, but that doesn't
mean he's retired.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.823
He's probably waiting
for me at baggage claim.

05:34.860 --> 05:37.363
Aria, don't go there. Let's just
try and live in the moment.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.368
Really? What moment?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.368
For all we know, Charles is
in Spencer's barn right now

05:41.400 --> 05:44.460
installing a lethal disco ball.
Which would make sense.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.478
That's where this whole
nightmare started.

05:46.510 --> 05:48.603
You need a sandwich.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.968
Would it help
if I were there?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.373
- Where?
- At Spencer's.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.910
The-the barn prom.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.445
I thought you said that you..

05:58.490 --> 06:00.014
Uh, that was when I was

06:00.060 --> 06:01.118
gonna be sharing a punch bowl

06:01.160 --> 06:03.583
with a bunch of former students.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.451
If you want me there,
I will be there.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.889
Unless I have to dress up
like a troll or something.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.367
I don't, do I?

06:21.780 --> 06:23.668
Uh, my dad has some work there

06:23.710 --> 06:24.745
so he thought it would be cool

06:24.780 --> 06:26.543
if we spent a few days together.

06:26.580 --> 06:27.672
Well, can't you
come home earlier

06:27.720 --> 06:29.039
so you don't miss the prom?

06:29.080 --> 06:30.081
We're all missing it.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.781
You said we're just hanging
out in Spencer's barn

06:31.820 --> 06:33.754
watching Molly Ringwald movies.

06:33.790 --> 06:36.486
- We could do that any day.
- Yeah, you know what?

06:36.530 --> 06:38.020
You're right.
It doesn't matter anyway.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.168
What?

06:54.210 --> 06:55.939
What's wrong?

06:55.980 --> 06:57.470
Nothing.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.516
Why are you bringing
an industrial strength laptop

07:02.550 --> 07:03.619
with you?

07:04.590 --> 07:06.558
Oh, um..

My dad wanted me to bring it.

He's...slowly morphing
into a techno geek.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.721
One of his clients wanted
him to build cabinets

07:13.760 --> 07:15.955
for all of his electronic toys.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.969
Hey, what do you want
from New York?

07:20.900 --> 07:21.935
Nothing. Honestly.

07:21.970 --> 07:24.063
At least let me
get you a new helmet.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.601
- Will you stop?
- Will you let me do something?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.733
Will you go
to prom with me?

07:31.110 --> 07:33.670
Sorry, that's..

07:33.720 --> 07:34.709
...not how I wanted
to ask you.

07:34.750 --> 07:38.208
I...did wanna
ask you, but..

07:42.630 --> 07:44.222
Yeah, it's weird.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.488
I get it.

07:45.530 --> 07:48.090

- Spencer..
- Just let me talk to Tanner.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.594
She needs to know
that I sent you to the arcade

08:25.630 --> 08:26.767
and that the candy
was meant for me.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.869

what was in it.

make me go there.

- Indefinitely.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.696
There's an investigation
and a hearing.

08:57.730 --> 08:59.027
Let me say something. Please?

08:59.070 --> 09:01.561
They're not interested
in anything you have to say.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.637
I gotta go.
I'm expected in there.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.739
I'm gonna call you later.

09:11.810 --> 09:13.641
Wait, before you call his dad

09:13.680 --> 09:15.045
why don't you just talk
to Caleb directly?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.685
There is no directly.
He's not answering his phone.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.709
I'm calling his dad.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.081
[cell phone beeping]

09:25.090 --> 09:25.920
What's that?

09:25.960 --> 09:28.758
It's a necklace
my grandmother gave me.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.725
I wore it to my prom.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.692
I thought maybe..

09:33.740 --> 09:35.662
...Hanna would
wanna wear It too.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.703
She's probably wearing sweats.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.334
What? Why? You all
bought beautiful dresses.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.940
Yeah, and those dresses
are now gonna be our dates.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.208
No one wants
to put on a ball gown

09:45.250 --> 09:47.718
and get splinters
in their butt.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.713
It's not that kind of barn.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.889
It's that kind of a prom.

09:55.790 --> 09:57.849
Why isn't Caleb coming?

09:58.660 --> 09:59.797
Um..

10:01.730 --> 10:03.129
...Caleb's in New York.

10:03.170 --> 10:07.095
Yep, everyone's
kind of scattered.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.631
[sighs]
Emily..

10:09.670 --> 10:13.106
...you all have been robbed
of so much already.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.973
Senior prom only
comes around once.

10:16.010 --> 10:18.774
Downsized or not,
dates or no dates.

10:18.810 --> 10:21.677
You guys should put on those
dresses and dance and..

10:22.450 --> 10:24.748
...feel beautiful.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.620
Well, I guess I'll give this
to her another time.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.009
- What's going on?
- Caleb's not going to New York.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.860
He packed that Rambo-laptop

10:45.910 --> 10:47.434
because he's gonna hunt
A down himself.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.731
Okay, how do you
know that he's--

10:48.780 --> 10:50.304
What else would it be, Emily?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.772
That's why he's been AWOL.

10:51.810 --> 10:52.947
And now he's gone all vigilante

10:52.980 --> 10:54.208
and he still doesn't think

10:54.250 --> 10:56.138
that he's gonna
get himself killed.

10:56.180 --> 10:58.080
[cell phone beeping]

10:58.720 --> 11:01.188
[phone ringing]

11:01.220 --> 11:03.882

Answer your phone, damn it.

[ringing continues]

11:06.090 --> 11:08.991
[ringing]

11:17.210 --> 11:18.336
Hello?

11:21.210 --> 11:22.700
Charles?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.843
Is that you?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.984
I can't go to that school prom.

11:31.820 --> 11:33.754
I'm not gonna be there.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.482
Please. Charles, talk to me.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.929
[call disconnects]

11:38.960 --> 11:39.722
[twig snaps]

11:39.760 --> 11:42.866
[dramatic music]

11:57.250 --> 11:58.376
- Hey.
- 'Hi.'

11:58.410 --> 11:59.809
Sorry I'm late.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.112
My physical therapist
is a talker.

12:01.150 --> 12:04.142
[chuckles]
Um, can I get you a coffee or..

12:04.190 --> 12:05.817
No, I'm good.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.078
What's this about?

12:07.120 --> 12:10.829
- Well, how is your arm?
- Still attached.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.020
Are you still
in a lot of pain?

12:12.060 --> 12:13.755
Spencer, you
didn't call me here

12:13.800 --> 12:14.949
for a medical update.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.820
And you don't have
to apologize again.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.759
It's not about me.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.836
It's about Alison.

12:21.870 --> 12:24.236
Look, I understand
why you're angry.

12:24.270 --> 12:26.875
Okay, stealing that
keycard was stupid

12:26.910 --> 12:28.878
and it was impulsive,
and it put you

12:28.910 --> 12:30.104
in a really
terrible position.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.846
But she just didn't
think it through.

12:32.880 --> 12:33.972
You sure about that?

12:34.020 --> 12:35.840
Because ever since I got
to Rosewood, all I've heard

12:35.880 --> 12:37.848
about Alison is how
she's a master planner

12:37.890 --> 12:38.982
and manipulator.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.510
Yeah, but you
didn't believe that.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.778
- You gave her a chance.
- I gave her more than that.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.923
And look where we are.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.898
Look...Lorenzo, um..

12:50.970 --> 12:53.268
...I know how you feel.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.292
I mean, I have been used
and abused by that girl

12:56.340 --> 12:58.900
more times than I
could pOSSlbly count.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.931
But she has changed.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.948
She's been through so much.

13:04.980 --> 13:07.244
And she's desperate.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.043
And I know that
she needs you.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.414
No, I think she got
what she needed.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.087
I think you're wrong.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.224
Alison's never had anyone
like you in her whole life.

13:21.530 --> 13:23.020
Somebody who saw
something in her

13:23.070 --> 13:24.890
that was vulnerable..

13:24.930 --> 13:26.363
...and genuine.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.867
Idid..

13:28.940 --> 13:30.828
...but I don't anymore.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.029
And there's..

13:35.080 --> 13:37.799
...really no way
you could ever forgive her?

13:41.950 --> 13:43.588
Not yet.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.417
Okay. Okay. Look.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.921
Um...if you change your mind..

13:49.960 --> 13:53.054
...we're having a promette..

13:53.100 --> 13:56.126
...in the barn
behind my house tonight.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.960
And maybe you could...
surprise her.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.830
Maybe you could
surprise yourself.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.013
Wow. Ha ha.
Is that all seafood?

14:16.050 --> 14:17.608
That looks delicious.

14:17.650 --> 14:19.982
Do you want me
to run it out to the girls?

14:20.020 --> 14:21.351
Oh, God, no. This is for us.

14:21.390 --> 14:23.358
They're having nachos.

14:23.390 --> 14:26.029
Did Spencer give you a hard time
about having us here?

14:26.060 --> 14:27.527
I know Aria
was not thrilled

14:27.560 --> 14:30.120
that I was gonna be
30 feet from her prom.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.968
You were closer to her when
you were her EngIIsh teacher.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.036
[rumbling]

14:35.070 --> 14:36.628
What was that?

14:36.670 --> 14:38.968
Was that thunder or music?

14:39.010 --> 14:41.433
That was probably
Hanna parking.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.629
Sorry.

14:42.680 --> 14:43.669
I wasn't expecting to know

14:43.710 --> 14:45.974
both the cops out front.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.012
Did that get us
any insider info?

14:48.050 --> 14:49.574
Are they closer
to finding him?

14:49.620 --> 14:52.248
I'm afraid that would take
more than a pecan sandie.

14:52.290 --> 14:53.985
Besides, these aren't
high-ranking officers

14:54.020 --> 14:56.113
so they wouldn't know anything.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.526
Well, as long as they stay awake
for the next three hours

14:58.560 --> 15:01.120
I am just grateful
they're out there.

15:04.030 --> 15:06.328
Uh, I don't think so.

15:06.370 --> 15:09.032
- Not tonight.
- No, I'll-I'll pass.

15:09.070 --> 15:11.504
Well, I'm not driving.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.401
[instrumental music]

15:16.440 --> 15:19.045
- You know, since it's open..
- I'll have one.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.308
Me too.

You'll forward this
to me, rIght?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.111
Yeah. Don't talk. Just smile.

15:57.150 --> 15:59.618
* Pretty pretty pretty

15:59.650 --> 16:00.981
Oh, no, you're not done.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.988
I want some on my phone.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.522
* I'd like to know
your name.. **

16:06.560 --> 16:09.051
Toby, can you just call
someone at the station?

16:09.100 --> 16:11.068
Hanna, when I
turned in my badge

16:11.100 --> 16:12.397
I got frostbite.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.591
I can't call in
any favors rIght now.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.131
Okay, if Caleb has some crazy
plan and you know about it--

16:17.170 --> 16:19.502
- I don't.
- Look at me when you say that.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.373
I don't know what Caleb
is up to right now. I swear.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.742
How did he keep this
a secret for so long?

16:28.780 --> 16:31.146
Not just him. Both of them.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.408
I mean, she was visiting him
and letting Kenneth

16:33.460 --> 16:35.382
believe that
their son was dead.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.524
I could never keep something
like that from my husband.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.098
Oh, please. You can't compare
yourself to that family.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.564
Lying is like
oxygen to them.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.625
I mean, Jason didn't even know
that he wasn't Kenneth's..

16:45.670 --> 16:46.989
[glass clinks]

brought to the prom?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.134
Bridget Woo.
And check this out.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.398
She's 85% tequila

17:22.440 --> 17:23.600
and her dress
is on backwards.

17:27.110 --> 17:28.338
What's going on?

17:28.380 --> 17:29.472
Nothing.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.814
Wow. Bridget really
should've gone with a zipper.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.818
Wait till Ali sees this.

17:35.850 --> 17:37.488
- Where is she?
- Alison?

17:37.520 --> 17:40.614
Where do you think?
She likes to make an entrance.

might just go under *

will be altered *

Am I supposed
to know these people?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.341
No. You're just supposed
to be looking at their outfits.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.779
Wait, is that
a-a lantern or a hat?

18:46.820 --> 18:48.617
That's her hair.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.220
Wait, Lucas took Jenna
to the prom? Seriously?

18:51.260 --> 18:53.353
No, they're just standing
next to each other.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.823
- Yeah, holding hands.
- She's tipping him.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.794
She probably thinks
he Uber-ed her there.

- Yeah.

19:06.670 --> 19:09.571
- Why? What's wrong?
- Alison went to prom.

19:09.610 --> 19:13.717
- He must've lured her there.
- Who did? Why is she there?

We shouldn't have
made you tell that story

19:36.300 --> 19:37.938
about Peter and Jessica.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.803
Believe me, it was easier
telling it than living it.

19:40.840 --> 19:44.276
Amen. Been there,
done that.

19:44.310 --> 19:46.949
I'm sorry, did I
say that out loud?

spend tIme out here anymore

on the girls?

20:17.650 --> 20:20.312
I think we should check

- Hey.

You are here.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.414
Yeah, it's my prom.

What are you doing here?

21:31.450 --> 21:32.439
Taking pictures.

You don't go
to school here, Clark.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.050
You're in college.

21:36.090 --> 21:38.524
Who hired you?

21:38.560 --> 21:41.051
Someone on the prom

21:41.100 --> 21:42.795
at the contest.

21:42.830 --> 21:44.821

were off the guest list.

21:49.370 --> 21:52.407

Who were you meeting?

21:58.580 --> 22:00.468
I don't think you wanna
be photographing her.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.977
Get one of the ice sculpture

This is a beautiful tray.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.052
I love it.

23:20.090 --> 23:21.626
It wasn't bad enough

23:21.660 --> 23:24.788
that this bitch tried
to steal my husband

23:24.830 --> 23:28.539

to bury her in our backyard.

Maybe we should
put on some music.

23:34.980 --> 23:38.541
This deranged freak tried
to frame my entire family.

23:38.580 --> 23:40.445
Maybe it wasn't Charles.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.782
I mean, I know that he put
our daughters through hell

23:44.820 --> 23:48.551
but I'm just saying that maybe
we can't pin all of this on him.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.449
You can't possibly
be defending--

23:51.490 --> 23:52.650
No, no, not at all, I'm just

23:52.690 --> 23:54.226
I'm just saying that

23:54.260 --> 23:56.899
maybe somebody else
buried Jessica out there.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.526
Like who?

23:59.570 --> 24:01.538
Like her husband.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.539
I mean, from what I've heard

24:04.570 --> 24:06.561
it could be revenge.

24:06.610 --> 24:09.238
For all the years
she kept this kid a secret.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.579
Maybe he wanted Peter
to discover the body.

24:12.610 --> 24:14.919
Maybe...we should ask him.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.111
- Who?
- Kenneth.

24:19.590 --> 24:21.808
- Where are you going?
- To get an answer.

Did he text you?

24:49.550 --> 24:50.983
So what if he did?

24:51.020 --> 24:53.511
I didn't ask you guys
to follow me here!

- Please...let me go.

- I stopped by the barn.

It was empty,
so I figured..

- You aren't upset, are you?
- No.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.005
Of course not. I just..

25:20.050 --> 25:21.779
I can't believe you'd
leave your prom to come to--

25:21.820 --> 25:24.618
This is where I felt
I should be.

25:24.650 --> 25:26.618

the night to pass

Kenneth?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.762
Why was the door open?

25:42.800 --> 25:46.236
Maybe he just stepped out.
His car is out there.

25:46.270 --> 25:47.578
Did you close that door?

my fingerprints on that.

to do this tonight.

I can look him in the eye

27:13.900 --> 27:14.992
and ask him why.

Why are you here?
You're not supposed to be.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.213
And you said
you were in New York.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.740
Which was a lie.
I talked to your dad.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.815
- You were never there.
- Yes, I was.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.748
Why? What are you
doing over there?

27:42.790 --> 27:43.927
I can't talk about it.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.178
Oh, do I need to make
an appointment?

27:46.230 --> 27:48.448
No. You need
to dance with me.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.196
- I'm not dancing with you.
- Yes, you are.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.925
I'm wearing the suit
that you picked out for me

27:52.970 --> 27:55.063
and it was_
a really long rIde.

27:55.100 --> 27:58.137
Just one dance...
and then we'll talk.

28:00.810 --> 28:03.802
I'm confused.
Is Mr. DiLaurentis here or not?

28:04.280 --> 28:05.907
We're not sure.

28:05.950 --> 28:08.248
Are any of you part
of the DiLaurentis family?

28:08.280 --> 28:10.316
Are you?

28:10.350 --> 28:11.783
We're neighbors. We were just--

28:11.820 --> 28:13.185
No, wait, hold it.

28:13.220 --> 28:15.916
I live next door.
What is your business here?

that was sponsored'

I had some
questions for him.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.730
Maybe I'll come back
at a better time.

- Shh.

is connected to Charles.

he's telling the truth.‘

Well, he is
a legitimate photographer.

29:32.030 --> 29:34.191
Well, he must've
tricked her into this.

He's seriously
freaking me out.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.468

Why would she say that?

29:46.510 --> 29:49.149
Why would she say that
I never even liked her?

29:49.180 --> 29:52.149
Well, because she hasn't always
been the easiest person to like.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.488
Yeah, but we came here
to protect her.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.182
That's all any of us have
been trying to do for weeks.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.357

We basically missed out
on our high school experience

trying to solve
the mystery that is Alison.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.364
The only reason we survived
is because we had each other.

Is that what
your speech is about?

30:12.140 --> 30:13.937
- For commencement?
- Oh, my God.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.038
Just forget about
the stupid speech.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.139
Nobody's ever gonna hear it.

Thanks again.
You didn't have to do this.

want you to know

to come with me to LA.

When I go there this summer
for my internship..

30:49.910 --> 30:52.879
...I need to go alone.

30:52.910 --> 30:55.140
I saw your airline
confirmation on your phone.

30:55.180 --> 30:58.980
I...I know that you bought
a ticket to LA.

31:00.390 --> 31:04.224
Ahem, did you also see
that it was a..

31:04.260 --> 31:07.149
...a layover
on my way to Thailand?

31:09.660 --> 31:10.991
What?

31:11.030 --> 31:14.090
Yeah, it's a, it's
a connecting flight.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.960
I'm not following
you to LA, Aria.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.160

...sticking around
here either.

I just, 1-1 decided
to join the Habitat Group

sooner rather than later.

Oh, you're going
to Thailand for the summer?

31:28.620 --> 31:30.247
Yeah.

Do you think
that's a mistake?

31:32.020 --> 31:34.409
No. God, no. I..

31:34.460 --> 31:37.020
That's a great idea.

31:37.060 --> 31:39.153
You need to move on.

Yeah.

be good for both of us.

about your friends?

the bar really high.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.151
Somebody who'll put
someone else's needs

32:14.200 --> 32:16.020
before their own..

32:16.060 --> 32:18.119
...and then not
resent them for it.

32:20.070 --> 32:23.961
Somebody who always expects
you to do the right thing..

32:24.010 --> 32:26.262
...and then forgives
you when you don't.

32:30.610 --> 32:32.976
Wow.

32:33.010 --> 32:36.446
I think your mother would be
pretty moved by that.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.641
Yeah, she might be.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.612
But I wrote it about you.

32:43.090 --> 32:49.051
* Ooh ooh ooh *

32:49.100 --> 32:52.160
[music continues]

32:59.170 --> 33:00.603
Crap.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.471
- 'What?‘
- 'We lost her.'

33:02.510 --> 33:05.001
[intense music]

33:06.150 --> 33:08.209
Are there more pictures
of him around here?

33:08.250 --> 33:09.376
How much more
do you need to see?

33:09.420 --> 33:12.412
They clearly
share the same DNA.

33:12.450 --> 33:15.157
We do not need to be looking
for more photographs.

33:15.190 --> 33:15.986
If we really think
that's Charles

33:16.020 --> 33:17.783
there are two cop cars
sitting outside.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.755
Jessica probably had her
secret stash of old photos.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.020
No, no, no. We are not
opening drawers now.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.028
That is trespassing.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.391
[rattling]

33:28.740 --> 33:30.059
What was that?

33:31.410 --> 33:33.162
[whispering]
It came from the basement.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.007
[rattling continues]

33:36.610 --> 33:38.498
That's where he is.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.371
- No, no, no, wait.
- Kenneth?

33:41.420 --> 33:43.615
Are you here?
I wanna talk to you.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.685
Look, we know you're here.
We heard you.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.124
What just happened?

33:55.160 --> 33:56.252
[lock clicks]

33:56.300 --> 33:57.551
[panﬁng]

33:58.370 --> 33:59.723
[rattling]

33:59.770 --> 34:02.068
Who locked that?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.204
- Open the door!
- Hey!

34:04.240 --> 34:05.468
[clanging]

34:05.510 --> 34:07.603
'Come on!'

34:07.640 --> 34:09.471
Open the door!

34:09.510 --> 34:11.341
[dramatic music]

34:13.650 --> 34:18.189
* Lo-o-ost

34:18.220 --> 34:23.715
* So lo-o-ost

34:24.590 --> 34:28.458
* Without you

34:30.400 --> 34:36.498
* Without you..

34:38.210 --> 34:39.734
Okay, you said
one dance.

34:39.770 --> 34:43.206
This is more than I danced
at the Katy Perry concert.

34:43.240 --> 34:45.208
If you were in New York,
what were you doing there?

34:47.750 --> 34:49.308
Getting a job.

34:49.350 --> 34:51.215
What? You already have a job.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.184
Not one that will pay
for a move to New York.

34:53.220 --> 34:55.188
Yeah, that job
is called bank robber.

34:55.220 --> 34:57.279
And who's moving
to New York?

34:58.490 --> 35:00.253
We are.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.258
If that's still your dream.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.261
Hanna, I-I had
to sign a waiver.

35:06.300 --> 35:11.328
But...I'm officially
an information risk analyst.

35:11.370 --> 35:14.134
- What's that?
- I keep the hackers out.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.101
For who?

35:15.140 --> 35:16.471
I can't even tell you
the name of the company.

35:16.510 --> 35:19.399
- Caleb.
- Hannah, it's real. Okay?

35:19.450 --> 35:21.247
And it pays enough
to cover your tuition

35:21.280 --> 35:22.417
and a place for us to live

35:22.450 --> 35:24.782
that's bigger than
that girl's hair.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.684
Wait, so this has
nothing to do with A?

35:31.260 --> 35:33.125
Just getting away from him.

35:34.200 --> 35:39.661
* So |o-o-ost..

35:41.600 --> 35:44.569
(Veronica)
Let's find another way
outta here.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.363
Who slammed the door? Don't
tell me that was just the wind.

35:47.410 --> 35:49.275
The wind has
a name. Charles.

35:49.310 --> 35:51.505
And we were in the same
room as that anImal.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.903
I'm sure he's still upstairs.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.770
No, he's probably in my yard

35:54.820 --> 35:56.276
on his way to the barn.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.413
Okay, there are
police right outside.

35:58.450 --> 35:59.917
Who cannot hear us.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.656
Why didn't any of us
bring a phone?

36:01.690 --> 36:04.579
Okay...let's find
another way out.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.281
What is this?
What's behind this?

36:07.630 --> 36:09.655

Move!

37:15.630 --> 37:17.518
(Aria)
What's the rush, Clark?

37:17.560 --> 37:19.266
We know who hired you
for this party.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.460
Where is he? Where's Charles?

37:20.500 --> 37:21.159
Look, get out of the way.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.031
You guys are totally off base.

37:23.070 --> 37:25.368
[grunting]

37:26.370 --> 37:27.928
Whose photo did you plan
on shooting with this?

37:27.970 --> 37:29.608
Look, get your hands
off of me, alright?

37:29.640 --> 37:30.800
You guys have no idea
what you're doing.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.876
Actually, I do.
I'm an officer.

37:32.910 --> 37:34.775
[sighs]
So am I.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.285
Wait. W-what's going on here?

37:41.990 --> 37:45.380
Is it true? Is that real?

37:45.430 --> 37:46.624
(Aria)
'Wait a minute.‘

37:46.660 --> 37:48.059
That whole time in the dark room

37:48.090 --> 37:50.297
when I met you at Hollis..

37:50.330 --> 37:51.365
How?

37:51.400 --> 37:52.697
Undercover, Aria.

37:52.730 --> 37:54.664
'Now, please let me
go do my job.'

* Ooh ma-ma-ma

38:03.680 --> 38:06.308
You really had no idea?

38:06.350 --> 38:07.647
None.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.511
Well, at least you were
safer than you thought.

Is she with Clark?

38:25.500 --> 38:27.388
We don't know.

Shouldn't we just
call the police?

40:01.800 --> 40:04.621
Clark and I already
called for backup.

40:04.670 --> 40:05.568
Where are the others?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.158
Hanna and Caleb are
checking the coatrooms.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.633
Aria was checking
the bathrooms.

40:08.670 --> 40:10.934
Somebody should
check the kitchens.

40:10.970 --> 40:12.608
Where's Alison?

40:14.810 --> 40:17.438
- Is she not here?
- She was, but..

40:17.480 --> 40:19.971
- We can't find her.
- But we will.

40:20.010 --> 40:22.069
Someone should check
with the parking guys.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.940
I'll-I'll go check the exits.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.208

Did you see any access

40:37.030 --> 40:37.997
to the baclqard?

40:38.030 --> 40:41.193
No, I couldn't see access
to my right hand.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.061
It's pitch black
and very tight

40:43.100 --> 40:44.567
and I think there's
something rotting in there.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.135
Please don't ask me
to do that again.

How are we gonna
get outta here?

How did they get through it?

40:57.120 --> 40:58.610
Our girls.

They went through this
and much worse.

We had one job tonight.

- Yeah, who else?
