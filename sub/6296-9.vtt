- ...formation! Corporal.
<i>- Oui, mon Capitaine!</i>

01:38.735 --> 01:40.503
Ready, my general!

01:40.604 --> 01:43.673
When we enter Rome,
Your Highness,

01:43.675 --> 01:45.373
we should demand
an immediate convocation

01:45.398 --> 01:47.059
of the sacred
College of Cardinals.

01:47.444 --> 01:49.946
For what purpose?

01:50.047 --> 01:52.215
Only the College
of Cardinals...

01:52.282 --> 01:54.884
...can depose a pope.

01:54.952 --> 01:59.589
I think you may find Rome
empty of cardinals, Your Highness,

01:59.623 --> 02:02.625
except for His Eminence
Cardinal Della Rovere.

02:02.693 --> 02:05.761
Forward!

02:05.829 --> 02:10.233
<i>Canon abord!</i>

02:10.300 --> 02:12.401
Forward!

02:15.305 --> 02:17.340
Tight file!

02:25.082 --> 02:26.983
- Faster!
- Forward!

02:27.084 --> 02:30.887
- Begin!
- Gate sentry, get ready!

02:32.890 --> 02:36.058
Where are
the cheering crowds?

02:36.126 --> 02:37.994
The welcoming populace?

02:38.095 --> 02:40.162
I would hazard
they have fled, my liege.

02:40.264 --> 02:43.099
Did you not promise us,
Cardinal,

02:43.166 --> 02:47.603
that the city of Rome would
welcome us with open arms?

02:47.671 --> 02:49.739
They have heard of your
military prowess, my liege.

02:49.806 --> 02:52.108
We smell politics.

02:52.175 --> 02:54.510
We dislike politics.

02:54.578 --> 02:56.198
There will be no argument
and no politics, sire.

02:56.223 --> 02:57.703
The battle has been won.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.877
And who won the battle?

03:00.250 --> 03:02.184
You did, sire.

03:02.252 --> 03:05.254
You truly are a clown,
Cardinal.

03:05.322 --> 03:08.024
Tight file!

03:08.125 --> 03:12.161
You are a true clairvoyance,
Lucrezia Borgia.

03:12.195 --> 03:16.098
- Why, thank you, Your Highness.
- And if we could impose

03:16.166 --> 03:21.203
on your diplomatic graces
once more, we would request

03:21.271 --> 03:27.276
an audience with your father,
His Holiness the Pope of Rome.

03:27.377 --> 03:31.347
There are matters of importance
I would discuss with him.

03:31.381 --> 03:36.819
- A private audience?
- Yes, of course.

03:36.887 --> 03:41.190
I think I know, at this hour,
where he may be found.

03:41.291 --> 03:44.360
Company halt!

03:53.236 --> 03:55.371
Cardinal.

03:59.843 --> 04:02.478
Men at arms, halt!

04:02.579 --> 04:04.580
Come, sire.

04:16.159 --> 04:19.995
His Holiness breaks his prayers
between prime and terce.

04:40.817 --> 04:45.354
<i>Miserere mei,</i>
<i>Deus,</i>

04:45.422 --> 04:47.390
secundum
magnam miseri...

04:47.457 --> 04:50.259
Your Holiness!

04:50.360 --> 04:54.296
- <i>Miserere mei...</i>
<i>- Your Holiness!</i>

04:54.398 --> 04:59.201
<i>...secundum magnam</i>
<i>misericordiam tuam.</i>

04:59.269 --> 05:02.271
Miserere mei, Deus,
secundum magnam

05:02.372 --> 05:04.940
<i>misericordiam...</i>
<i>Forgive me, Friar.</i>

05:05.008 --> 05:07.843
I am seeking an audience
with the pope.

05:07.944 --> 05:10.579
You have been interrupted
at prayer.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.916
Our prayers are ended.

05:14.017 --> 05:18.387
And perhaps
they will be answered.

05:20.891 --> 05:25.394
Can this really be
the Pope of Rome?

05:25.462 --> 05:26.862
Pope Alexander--

05:26.963 --> 05:31.200
Sextus.
At your service, my lord.

05:33.770 --> 05:36.939
And you, my lord, are?

05:37.040 --> 05:40.543
King Charles
of France.

05:43.313 --> 05:46.382
It is not
as we expected.

05:46.483 --> 05:49.952
Does the Pope of Rome
disappoint Your Highness?

05:49.986 --> 05:52.455
Had you hoped for gold

05:52.489 --> 05:54.924
and silver vestments?

05:54.991 --> 05:58.294
Display has its purpose.

05:58.328 --> 06:02.665
But simplicity must
rule our hearts.

06:02.766 --> 06:04.767
We are all of us naked

06:04.835 --> 06:08.104
before God.
Even the Pope of Rome.

06:08.171 --> 06:10.106
Even...

06:10.173 --> 06:13.943
...the King of France.

06:23.186 --> 06:27.957
Who's there?

06:34.765 --> 06:37.333
I have missed
those hands.

06:42.873 --> 06:44.940
And I have missed
that face.

06:47.878 --> 06:50.346
I have brought a king
to Rome, Cesare,

06:50.447 --> 06:52.381
from a far-off land.

06:52.482 --> 06:54.383
I have heard.

06:54.484 --> 06:58.354
My little sister has achieved
what the papal arms could not.

06:58.455 --> 07:00.689
He seeks guidance

07:00.791 --> 07:02.958
from the head
of Christendom.

07:03.026 --> 07:05.060
Of course.

07:08.265 --> 07:10.699
I am sure you too,
Your Highness,

07:10.767 --> 07:14.970
sometime long to be free
of the burden of kingship.

07:15.038 --> 07:18.808
- To walk as a man among men.
- Ah.

07:18.909 --> 07:20.876
It would be sweet relief,
Your Holiness.

07:20.911 --> 07:23.913
Just as we long to be free
of the burden of the papacy.

07:24.014 --> 07:28.984
The papal robes are such
a weight upon our shoulders.

07:29.052 --> 07:32.154
One longs to be relieved
of the burden,

07:32.222 --> 07:35.224
to be
a simple priest again,

07:35.258 --> 07:38.093
praying
to the God of Abraham.

07:38.161 --> 07:40.262
We understand,
Your Holiness.

07:40.330 --> 07:42.003
Then perhaps
Your Highness knows one who

07:42.028 --> 07:43.630
would relieve us of this burden?

07:45.001 --> 07:48.904
The very thought appals me,
Your Holiness.

07:48.939 --> 07:50.906
Really?

07:50.941 --> 07:53.342
Why?

07:53.410 --> 07:56.812
We do not choose our calling,
Your Holiness.

07:56.913 --> 07:58.914
It is chosen for us.

07:59.015 --> 08:03.619
When called to serve,
as King of France,

08:03.687 --> 08:06.455
and, I am sure,
as Pope of Rome,

08:06.556 --> 08:09.892
we can only have
one response:

08:14.297 --> 08:15.731
<i>serviam.</i>

08:15.799 --> 08:18.634
I will serve.

08:18.735 --> 08:21.136
However imperfect
my service,

08:21.238 --> 08:23.639
however human
my failings,

08:23.707 --> 08:26.275
when called to serve...

08:26.376 --> 08:30.379
Your Highness is
troubled.

08:32.549 --> 08:35.451
I have exulted
in the thrill of battle.

08:35.485 --> 08:38.287
I have turned streets

08:38.321 --> 08:41.657
into rivers of blood.

08:41.725 --> 08:44.460
I have played the part
of God,

08:44.494 --> 08:47.096
and in my arrogance,

08:47.163 --> 08:50.833
I assumed
that I served His cause.

08:53.169 --> 08:54.570
Then perhaps

08:54.671 --> 08:57.573
what is needed...

08:59.509 --> 09:02.278
...is a renewal
of one's vows.

09:02.345 --> 09:04.013
One's vows?

09:04.080 --> 09:06.482
A renewal
of your vows of kingship

09:06.516 --> 09:09.485
before the Pope of Rome.

09:09.586 --> 09:14.156
The papal investiture
of the Kingdom of France.

09:18.495 --> 09:19.962
France,

09:20.030 --> 09:22.464
as you must know,
Your Holiness,

09:22.565 --> 09:27.002
has traditional claims
upon the Kingdom of Naples.

09:27.070 --> 09:29.171
But of course!

09:29.272 --> 09:32.074
Even better.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.510
The papal investiture

09:34.611 --> 09:36.745
of the kingdoms

09:36.846 --> 09:40.649
of France and Naples.

09:40.750 --> 09:45.254
And your solemn oath,

09:45.322 --> 09:47.523
before God...

09:50.360 --> 09:55.197
...to rule them
in His holy name.

10:03.039 --> 10:06.542
You must tell me
everything, sis.

10:06.676 --> 10:10.479
There are some things, brother,
it would be best not to speak of.

10:10.547 --> 10:12.715
Your husband,
Giovanni Sforza,

10:12.782 --> 10:14.917
he proved ungallant?

10:15.018 --> 10:18.354
More than that. He betrayed
our father, the pope.

10:18.421 --> 10:20.823
I know of his betrayal, sis,
and he shall pay the price.

10:20.890 --> 10:24.493
but if he misused you he shall
pay a different kind of price.

10:24.594 --> 10:28.297
It has been a long journey,
Cesare, and I...

10:28.398 --> 10:31.934
And I have kept my spirits
intact thus far, but... I...

10:37.207 --> 10:42.678
- Lucrezia... you need a medic.
- No, no, no, brother.

10:42.746 --> 10:45.447
But you are ill.

10:45.515 --> 10:48.217
You are faint.

10:48.318 --> 10:50.386
It is a common illness,
brother.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.490
I am with child.

10:56.659 --> 10:58.594
My God.

10:58.661 --> 11:01.230
Does...
does anybody know?

11:01.264 --> 11:06.668
Only one: Giulia Farnese.
And I would keep it that way.

11:08.571 --> 11:12.674
- Why?
- Because the child,

11:12.776 --> 11:15.377
thank God...

11:15.445 --> 11:18.313
...is not my husband's.

11:30.293 --> 11:32.561
The Pope of Rome has kindly

11:32.629 --> 11:35.397
put the Castel Sant'Angelo
at our disposal.

11:35.465 --> 11:37.933
We can billet the troops
on the populace

11:37.967 --> 11:41.403
of The Eternal City.
And you'll be please to know,

11:41.471 --> 11:43.705
Cardinal Della Rovere,

11:43.807 --> 11:47.976
the College of Cardinals will be
convened.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.746
Gate sentry, ready!

11:55.985 --> 11:57.886
Father.

11:57.987 --> 11:59.888
Holy Father.

12:01.825 --> 12:03.492
Um...

12:03.626 --> 12:05.527
The French king--

12:05.628 --> 12:08.230
Proved to be a man of God

12:08.331 --> 12:11.767
in search of guidance
and spiritual solace,

12:11.835 --> 12:13.769
like any man.

12:13.837 --> 12:19.408
There may be kings
more handsome,

12:19.476 --> 12:21.610
but hardly more devout.

12:21.678 --> 12:25.681
And, uh,
what of Naples?

12:25.748 --> 12:28.575
We discussed the investiture
of the Kingdom of Naples.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.166
And I told him,

12:30.453 --> 12:33.088
there was no need
for a great army.

12:33.189 --> 12:35.624
All he had to do was
to ask.

12:38.828 --> 12:40.476
The College of Cardinals will be
convened not

12:40.501 --> 12:44.544
to discuss our deposition
but to consider their shameful

12:44.547 --> 12:47.913
abandonment of the Vatican in
its hour of need.

12:59.649 --> 13:03.218
You have returned the books,
Burchard.

13:05.221 --> 13:07.723
Of course,
Your Holiness.

13:07.790 --> 13:10.392
Well, please, continue.

13:13.897 --> 13:19.234
We have... convened
the College of Cardinals.

13:19.369 --> 13:22.252
We find their abandonment
of the Vatican

13:22.339 --> 13:26.544
in its hour of greatest peril
truly shameful.

13:27.443 --> 13:31.613
As must you,
surely,

13:31.681 --> 13:33.849
Burchard.

13:33.883 --> 13:38.120
It is indeed most shameful,
Your Holiness.

13:38.188 --> 13:42.858
Your own absence has been
noted.

13:42.892 --> 13:47.229
But we believe
that your concern was

13:47.363 --> 13:50.532
with the most sacred volumes
of our library.

13:50.633 --> 13:54.336
I did my best to protect them
from harm, Your Holiness.

13:54.404 --> 13:56.872
Well.

13:56.906 --> 14:00.409
Well, now you must study them
carefully

14:00.476 --> 14:03.812
and find a precedent
for us.

14:05.748 --> 14:08.317
We think that a period
of penitence is in order

14:08.384 --> 14:11.820
for the curia
who so selfishly abandoned us.

14:13.756 --> 14:16.892
What kind of penitence did
His Holiness have in mind?

14:18.828 --> 14:22.264
We think they should present
themselves in sackcloth

14:22.332 --> 14:26.902
and ashes
at the next convention.

14:26.936 --> 14:30.372
Sackcloth
and ashes?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.274
Yes.

14:32.342 --> 14:34.076
Can you find

14:34.177 --> 14:36.511
such a precedent for us?

14:36.579 --> 14:39.715
I will do my utmost,
Your Holiness.

14:54.797 --> 14:58.467
I am the convent's
benefactor. You'll be safe.

14:58.568 --> 15:01.370
Must I take
the cloth?

15:01.471 --> 15:03.805
No.

15:03.940 --> 15:08.543
But you may rest here
while you are still with child.

15:11.314 --> 15:13.982
Must I hide myself, then?

15:14.117 --> 15:17.386
Perhaps,
until the child is born.

15:17.453 --> 15:20.088
There is the annulment
of your marriage to consider.

15:20.156 --> 15:22.924
Can my marriage be
annulled?

15:22.992 --> 15:26.261
Only if it was
never consummated.

15:26.329 --> 15:29.464
But I am
with child, Cesare.

15:29.499 --> 15:32.334
Indeed.
The child is not his.

15:32.468 --> 15:34.836
But my marriage was
consummated.

15:34.904 --> 15:38.940
In... the harshest
possible manner.

15:39.008 --> 15:41.009
I beg you not
to worry about it, sis.

15:41.110 --> 15:43.745
I will find a solution,
I swear.

15:45.682 --> 15:47.690
And I have a dear friend here
who promised to take

15:47.715 --> 15:49.415
the very best of care of you.

15:51.688 --> 15:53.355
Her name?

15:53.489 --> 15:56.091
Sister Martha.

15:56.159 --> 15:59.494
She was once known
as Ursula Bonadeo.

15:59.595 --> 16:01.663
I remember.

16:11.007 --> 16:12.407
Sister Martha.

16:12.508 --> 16:16.878
- Cardinal.
- My sister, Lucrezia Borgia.

16:16.979 --> 16:19.681
I remember.
I was at her wedding.

16:19.782 --> 16:21.683
Sister.

16:21.718 --> 16:24.553
You still look beautiful.

16:24.687 --> 16:27.022
But you have lost
your wonderful hair.

16:28.958 --> 16:32.227
A woman's beauty can be
a great distraction.

16:32.328 --> 16:34.696
As you yourself must
already know.

16:36.566 --> 16:38.700
You will find it
peaceful here.

16:38.801 --> 16:41.336
And maybe peace is what you need
at this juncture.

16:41.404 --> 16:44.239
I must warn you,
Sister,

16:44.307 --> 16:47.376
I shall visit
at every available opportunity.

16:47.410 --> 16:49.845
You must.

16:49.912 --> 16:51.847
I will.

17:04.926 --> 17:07.028
Goodbye, sister.

17:12.902 --> 17:16.171
There are beauteous
women in Naples, I have been told.

17:16.271 --> 17:17.195
Oh!

17:17.221 --> 17:19.996
Even for
this ugly snout of mine.

17:22.111 --> 17:26.448
They will swear
it is divine, Your Highness.

17:28.384 --> 17:30.318
They can lie
in Naples?

17:30.386 --> 17:32.521
Exceedingly well.

17:32.588 --> 17:35.424
They hardly know what truth is.
Hah!

17:37.527 --> 17:39.895
A most excellent pontiff,
your father,

17:39.962 --> 17:41.296
is he not?

17:41.431 --> 17:45.400
I have... no other
to compare him with.

17:45.468 --> 17:48.904
Well, he has suited
our purpose.

17:48.971 --> 17:51.606
We could be said
to have an understanding.

17:51.707 --> 17:53.975
We could, indeed.

17:54.043 --> 17:56.545
But in case--
just in case--

17:56.646 --> 17:59.080
we would make a request
of Your Holiness.

17:59.148 --> 18:03.151
We will
respectfully hear it.

18:03.252 --> 18:06.488
We would have you nominate
a papal legate

18:06.589 --> 18:11.159
to accompany our armies
to the Kingdom of Naples.

18:11.227 --> 18:13.628
To remain with us

18:13.729 --> 18:16.097
for the duration
of our visit.

18:20.503 --> 18:23.104
Very well.

18:23.172 --> 18:25.807
We will nominate a legate
of our choice--

18:25.908 --> 18:28.610
Oh, no! Not of your choice,
Holy Father.

18:30.513 --> 18:33.148
Of ours.

18:33.182 --> 18:36.351
Who would you choose?

18:36.419 --> 18:38.987
Your son.

18:39.088 --> 18:41.423
Cardinal Cesare Borgia.

18:43.359 --> 18:45.794
You would have me
accompany your army

18:45.862 --> 18:48.630
as... a hostage?

18:48.698 --> 18:51.433
No. God forbid.

18:51.501 --> 18:54.936
A hostage implies
enmity.

18:55.037 --> 18:57.639
And what does legate imply?

18:57.707 --> 19:01.109
Friendship, surely.

19:01.177 --> 19:04.479
And a guarantee that
such friendship will continue.

19:04.547 --> 19:06.548
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

19:10.953 --> 19:12.888
What is the difference,
Holy Father,

19:13.022 --> 19:15.891
between hostage and legate?
As the king said,

19:16.025 --> 19:18.393
one implies enmity,
the other friendship.

19:18.494 --> 19:20.996
And you will insist
on this charade?

19:21.063 --> 19:25.367
King Charles will not remain
in Naples for long.

19:25.401 --> 19:27.402
How can you be certain?

19:27.470 --> 19:31.106
We are not certain,
but we suspect.

19:31.173 --> 19:33.909
You should take your manservant
with you.

19:34.010 --> 19:36.411
For entertainment.
For protection.

19:36.512 --> 19:38.134
And if you find the rumours
of an outbreak

19:38.159 --> 19:40.020
of plague in Naples are true,

19:40.516 --> 19:43.485
I'm sure you can
find your way home.

19:43.553 --> 19:45.487
Are we understood?

19:45.555 --> 19:47.222
Understood.

19:47.323 --> 19:49.591
Good.

19:49.659 --> 19:55.030
Because now another charade
demands our attention.

20:16.118 --> 20:19.120
You may sit,
cardinals.

20:19.188 --> 20:23.692
Now, before we begin
the proceedings,

20:23.759 --> 20:26.328
we would consider

20:26.429 --> 20:30.465
the penitential intentions
of each member

20:30.533 --> 20:32.233
of this college.

20:34.136 --> 20:37.238
We would start
with the vice-chancellor,

20:37.306 --> 20:40.041
Cardinal Ascanio Sforza.

20:46.349 --> 20:48.750
You may kneel,
Cardinal.

20:59.729 --> 21:02.664
My shame, I hope,

21:02.732 --> 21:05.433
is obvious to all,
Your Holiness.

21:05.501 --> 21:08.169
And of what
are you ashamed?

21:08.237 --> 21:12.407
Of my abandonment
of Rome--

21:12.475 --> 21:14.876
of St. Peter's,
of your...

21:14.977 --> 21:17.312
...sacred presence.

21:17.380 --> 21:19.247
In our hour of need.

21:19.348 --> 21:22.516
- Indeed.
- Mm.

21:22.627 --> 21:25.863
And in recompense,
I offer all the benefices

21:25.864 --> 21:29.657
of the Sforza
ecclesiastical estates

21:29.682 --> 21:31.527
to the Holy See
of St. Peter's.

21:36.298 --> 21:39.968
That is kind,
indeed.

21:40.036 --> 21:43.371
And we shall
most graciously accept.

21:45.341 --> 21:48.176
Cardinal...
Piccolomini.

21:59.622 --> 22:03.692
Unburden your soul.

22:08.130 --> 22:12.467
In our capacity
as the Chosen of God,

22:12.568 --> 22:14.736
the Bishop of Rome,

22:14.837 --> 22:17.372
the Vicar of Jesus Christ,

22:17.473 --> 22:19.374
successor to the prince

22:19.475 --> 22:21.609
of the Apostles,

22:21.677 --> 22:26.614
Supreme Pontiff
of the Universal Church,

22:28.551 --> 22:31.820
we invest thee,

22:31.921 --> 22:34.622
Charles of France,

22:34.690 --> 22:39.260
with the crowns
of France

22:39.361 --> 22:43.431
and the crown
of Naples.

22:43.499 --> 22:47.268
And we confer
our sacred blessing

22:47.369 --> 22:54.075
on thy reign
in both those kingdoms.

22:54.143 --> 22:57.178
♪

23:08.457 --> 23:11.626
It is an august sight,
is it not?

23:11.761 --> 23:14.662
St. Peter's
in its full glory;

23:14.764 --> 23:17.899
the Pope of Rome
in cathedra;

23:17.967 --> 23:21.936
the Sistine Chapel Choir
singing;

23:21.971 --> 23:27.275
it would bring tears
to one's eyes, Cardinal Borgia.

23:27.309 --> 23:30.578
I want to compliment you,
Cardinal, on your steadfastness,

23:30.646 --> 23:34.048
your probity,
your survival, indeed.

23:34.150 --> 23:37.585
It did prove hard
at times.

23:37.653 --> 23:41.156
In fact, you proved
such a worthy opponent

23:41.257 --> 23:44.592
that I would gladly have you
back in Rome.

23:44.660 --> 23:48.830
- You?
- I have my father's ear,

23:48.898 --> 23:50.832
as you must understand.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.135
And he needs someone with
the steel that your soul has.

23:54.236 --> 23:56.104
He has you, does he not?

23:56.172 --> 23:58.406
I will not be cardinal
forever.

23:58.507 --> 24:00.308
Surely you must know that.

24:00.409 --> 24:03.111
And the other
cardinals?

24:03.179 --> 24:06.281
The Holy Father's problem is,
he surrounds himself

24:06.348 --> 24:09.979
with weakness. And with
your strength, Cardinal...

24:10.004 --> 24:11.513
I serve God,

24:11.687 --> 24:14.923
and can only pray
the papacy survives

24:14.990 --> 24:17.325
its current occupant.

24:19.328 --> 24:22.363
I could have killed you--
twice.

24:24.333 --> 24:28.036
Perhaps, then,
you should kill me now,

24:28.103 --> 24:30.872
because my opposition
to the Borgia papacy will

24:30.973 --> 24:33.441
only die with me.

24:50.426 --> 24:55.763
Micheletto, how do you think
my escort becomes me?

24:55.831 --> 24:59.200
Seems to be an escort worthy
of your stature, Your Eminence.

24:59.301 --> 25:01.202
What is my stature,
Micheletto?

25:01.303 --> 25:04.839
Papal legate to our new friend,
the French king, is it not?

25:04.940 --> 25:07.281
And as papal legate,
I should be free to ride

25:07.306 --> 25:08.968
where I choose, should I not?

25:09.278 --> 25:11.312
Indeed you should,
Your Eminence.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.780
Well, then...

25:12.882 --> 25:16.217
I shall ride!

25:16.285 --> 25:19.888
Halt! Halt!

25:19.989 --> 25:22.223
- Company!
- Micheletto.

25:22.291 --> 25:24.392
It seems I am not
papal legate after all.

25:24.460 --> 25:26.561
Then what are you,
Your Eminence?

25:26.629 --> 25:29.230
It seems I am nobody,
Micheletto.

25:29.331 --> 25:31.766
Nobody?

25:31.834 --> 25:34.202
Either that
or a hostage.

25:34.270 --> 25:36.771
Is this why we ride
without weapons?

25:36.839 --> 25:40.909
We ride without weapons
because they were forbidden us.

25:41.043 --> 25:43.945
Then I am now servant
to a hostage, Your Eminence.

25:47.283 --> 25:49.584
There are many ways
to kill a man.

25:49.652 --> 25:54.155
But for absolute silence,
he prefers, um--

25:54.223 --> 25:56.391
tell them, Micheletto.

25:56.425 --> 26:00.028
- The garrote.
- And what is the garrote, pray?

26:00.095 --> 26:03.431
Ah, it's... it's
just a cheese cutter, my friend.

26:03.532 --> 26:06.935
You can kill with a cheese cutter?

26:07.069 --> 26:10.505
Most efficiently, yes.

26:10.572 --> 26:12.507
Show me.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.412
You wish to see?

26:17.513 --> 26:19.347
Certainly.

26:21.283 --> 26:24.352
How does it work?
Like this.

26:24.420 --> 26:26.688
Ugh!

26:42.638 --> 26:44.378
Where are we
heading, Your Eminence?

26:44.403 --> 26:45.981
To Pesaro.

26:46.709 --> 26:48.876
And Giovanni Sforza.
Come on!

26:50.813 --> 26:55.316
We are as shocked as you are,
Monsieur Ambassador,

26:55.451 --> 26:57.785
by the cardinal's
disappearance.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.722
But as to his whereabouts,
Your Holiness?

27:00.789 --> 27:02.824
Oh, his whereabouts,
well...

27:02.925 --> 27:04.592
We have no idea.

27:04.660 --> 27:07.962
Would you inform
His Royal Highness

27:08.030 --> 27:12.233
that we will dispatch
whatever cardinal he wishes

27:12.301 --> 27:13.735
to replace him--

27:13.802 --> 27:17.739
Cardinal...
Sforza, perhaps?

27:17.840 --> 27:22.076
I will inform His Royal Highness
thus, Your Holiness.

27:22.177 --> 27:25.780
And please convey to him
our wholehearted support

27:25.848 --> 27:28.983
for his Neapolitan
adventure.

27:29.051 --> 27:34.922
We do not regard the conquest of
Naples as an <i>aventure, Your Holiness.</i>

27:34.990 --> 27:37.191
Oh, no, no.

27:37.259 --> 27:40.094
But maybe Naples does.

27:40.195 --> 27:41.796
And now,

27:41.864 --> 27:44.065
if you will excuse us,

27:46.435 --> 27:49.470
we have another audience
to attend to.

28:07.890 --> 28:10.892
Come on.

28:10.959 --> 28:13.828
Walk on.
I'll take your mount, my lord.

28:15.831 --> 28:17.732
- Go on.
- There you go.

28:17.833 --> 28:19.734
Make sure
you tighten that saddle.

28:19.802 --> 28:21.836
How are my dogs?

28:32.748 --> 28:34.849
You missed the hunt
today.

28:34.917 --> 28:38.219
There's always tomorrow.
Always tomorrow.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.922
Don't eat too much.
Be ready for the stag.

29:00.242 --> 29:03.111
Killing would be easier,
Your Eminence.

29:03.245 --> 29:06.280
But some things should not be
easy, Micheletto.

29:12.521 --> 29:14.689
Hah!

29:17.659 --> 29:19.193
Yah!

30:06.675 --> 30:08.609
Where am I?

30:08.677 --> 30:11.846
Where all roads lead to:
Rome.

30:11.914 --> 30:15.016
Ah!

30:17.019 --> 30:19.687
In there.

30:19.788 --> 30:22.323
I must protest
against this outrage!

30:22.357 --> 30:24.125
Beaten, bound,

30:24.193 --> 30:26.594
taken here
against my will.

30:30.132 --> 30:32.533
Could this be true?

30:32.601 --> 30:36.804
Um, he did prove somewhat
unwilling, Your Holiness.

30:39.975 --> 30:43.878
Well, you're here now,
and you're safe.

30:43.946 --> 30:46.547
That's the main thing,
is it not?

30:48.850 --> 30:51.786
And, why, may I ask,
am I here?

30:51.853 --> 30:56.157
Why, to discuss the annulment
of your marriage, of course.

30:56.258 --> 30:58.459
Annulment
of my marriage?

30:58.527 --> 31:01.963
You must admit,
it did prove a disappointment.

31:02.030 --> 31:05.533
The promised help
of the Sforza family

31:05.567 --> 31:09.070
to the papal states
simply never arrived.

31:09.204 --> 31:10.905
And the marriage bed,

31:10.973 --> 31:15.076
we are told,
was far from happy.

31:15.210 --> 31:17.011
You'll never get
away with this.

31:17.079 --> 31:21.015
On the contrary,
canon law is admirably clear

31:21.083 --> 31:22.817
on these matters.

31:22.918 --> 31:26.420
Dear Burchard will
elaborate.

31:26.555 --> 31:29.257
It is written
as if in stone.

31:29.358 --> 31:33.427
There can be only one ground
for the annulment of a marriage.

31:33.562 --> 31:36.764
- And that is?
- Non-consummation.

31:36.865 --> 31:38.766
Non-consummation?

31:40.168 --> 31:42.570
You'll never be able
to prove it.

31:42.671 --> 31:44.905
Let me finish.

31:45.007 --> 31:48.843
If the marriage can be proved
never to have been consummated,

31:48.944 --> 31:51.512
why, then,
Your Holiness,

31:51.580 --> 31:55.716
it never existed as a m.

32:02.924 --> 32:05.359
Lady Lucrezia,

32:05.427 --> 32:09.063
you have intimated
some grave disappointment

32:09.097 --> 32:10.998
on your wedding night.

32:11.099 --> 32:14.074
It was disturbing,
Your Honour, in the extreme.

32:14.101 --> 32:16.633
Would you be so kind
as to elaborate?

32:16.934 --> 32:20.078
I blush with shame
to speak of such matters

32:20.108 --> 32:23.077
before this august company,

32:23.111 --> 32:26.514
but, sadly...

32:28.417 --> 32:32.953
...tragically, my husband
revealed himself to be...

32:36.124 --> 32:38.793
You may speak frankly,
Lady Lucrezia.

32:38.894 --> 32:41.462
These are grave matters.

32:41.530 --> 32:45.132
My husband...
turned out...

32:47.969 --> 32:50.805
Please proceed.

32:54.309 --> 32:56.610
Turned out...

32:56.645 --> 32:58.612
...to be impotent.

32:58.647 --> 33:00.548
Ah.

33:00.615 --> 33:04.118
Monstrous.

33:04.157 --> 33:07.426
This is monstrous! I can
prove it! On the wedding night--

33:11.226 --> 33:15.996
- Yes?
- You said, on the wedding night...

33:16.098 --> 33:18.833
- I say she lies.
- Indeed.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.736
But you just mentioned...
proof.

33:21.837 --> 33:23.637
She lies.

33:23.739 --> 33:25.506
Ah.

33:28.243 --> 33:31.512
There are precedents,
Your Holiness,

33:31.613 --> 33:36.183
for a demonstration
of proof of...

33:36.318 --> 33:39.019
...potency.
Oh.

33:39.121 --> 33:41.856
The Lord Sforza could
demonstrate the truth

33:41.957 --> 33:43.538
of his claims to full potency

33:43.563 --> 33:47.592
with the Lady Lucrezia before
a gathering of canon lawyers.

33:48.196 --> 33:50.765
No, no, no. That would
surely be distasteful

33:50.866 --> 33:53.033
to the lady herself--

33:53.101 --> 33:58.506
indeed,
as would the lord. Hmm?

33:58.573 --> 34:01.342
The very thought is
an outrage.

34:01.410 --> 34:05.346
Well, then, there remains
one more possibility.

34:07.315 --> 34:12.453
A public demonstration
of the Lord Sforza's prowess,

34:12.521 --> 34:15.523
with 1 or 2
willing maidens

34:15.590 --> 34:20.661
would also constitute
proof of potency.

34:20.762 --> 34:22.696
- Public?
- Indeed.

34:22.797 --> 34:24.799
In a place of the college's
choosing before a gathering

34:24.866 --> 34:29.170
of canon lawyers and a selection
of the Roman public.

34:31.005 --> 34:32.739
You mean courtesans?

34:32.841 --> 34:39.447
We will spare the Lord Sforza
such public humiliation.

34:39.514 --> 34:42.983
A demonstration here,

34:43.051 --> 34:45.485
before our brother cardinals

34:45.554 --> 34:48.022
would suffice.

35:41.776 --> 35:44.503
Would His Holiness see
the Lord Sforza

35:44.528 --> 35:46.684
with one or both of us?

35:54.956 --> 35:56.924
Burchard?

35:56.958 --> 36:01.395
One demonstration will
suffice.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.197
Me first, then.

36:20.815 --> 36:23.484
Do these thighs
not please you?

36:23.618 --> 36:27.054
Enough!

36:35.163 --> 36:36.997
Give me a divorce.

36:37.098 --> 36:39.133
But on what grounds?

36:41.069 --> 36:44.772
Impotence.

36:44.839 --> 36:49.677
We must hear it
from the Lord Sforza's own lips.

36:49.811 --> 36:52.079
For the record,

36:52.180 --> 36:55.783
on the wedding night...

36:55.850 --> 36:59.486
On the wedding night I did not
consummate my marriage.

36:59.521 --> 37:02.356
Did not, or could not?

37:02.457 --> 37:04.692
Did not.

37:07.495 --> 37:10.864
And could not.

37:10.999 --> 37:15.703
You were on that night
and remain...

37:19.374 --> 37:20.808
Impotent.

37:24.613 --> 37:26.447
We declare

37:26.514 --> 37:29.984
the marriage
between the Lady Lucrezia Borgia

37:30.051 --> 37:34.455
and the Lord Giovanni Sforza...

37:34.522 --> 37:37.458
...to be invalid,

37:37.525 --> 37:41.962
as if
it never existed.

37:57.746 --> 37:59.647
Farewell, my lady!

38:04.552 --> 38:07.287
Cockadoodle-doooooo!

38:24.239 --> 38:26.607
Is there a room
in this kingdom

38:26.741 --> 38:29.176
that doesn't stink
of death?

38:29.244 --> 38:34.448
What is this pestilence?
I know not, my liege.

38:36.418 --> 38:38.452
Noooooo!

38:51.066 --> 38:54.568
I will die on this bed.
No, you will not!

38:57.038 --> 38:58.939
Do not let my child die!

38:59.040 --> 39:02.476
- Nobody will die!
- You must push, my lady.

39:16.991 --> 39:18.926
Cesare!

39:18.993 --> 39:20.828
Mother.

39:20.929 --> 39:23.297
How is she?

39:23.331 --> 39:25.399
Alive still, at least.

39:25.467 --> 39:27.835
I came
as quickly as I could.

39:40.348 --> 39:42.416
Stay back.

40:01.035 --> 40:02.970
Plague.

40:03.037 --> 40:06.206
Did the Borgia Pope know
of this?

40:16.217 --> 40:20.888
More effort, my lady.
Water.

40:20.989 --> 40:22.322
Water!

40:24.225 --> 40:25.692
God is with you.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.802
Mother!

40:40.875 --> 40:42.810
- Hello, Mother.
- How are you, Cesare?

40:42.877 --> 40:44.812
- Has she had it yet?
- No.

40:44.913 --> 40:47.314
A boy, I hope.

40:56.024 --> 40:59.860
I tried, but I could not
keep him away.

40:59.928 --> 41:02.930
He insisted.
Indeed.

41:06.267 --> 41:08.335
Ah.

41:08.436 --> 41:11.538
He loves
each new arrival.

41:11.606 --> 41:14.908
But try to tell him
of the birthing pains.

41:14.943 --> 41:17.778
No, no, no, no, no.
Not now, Vanozza.

41:20.448 --> 41:24.184
With Juan
I was in agony for days.

41:24.285 --> 41:28.288
Do you remember?
Mmm. I remember...

41:28.389 --> 41:32.092
...the joy of holding him
in my arms.

41:32.193 --> 41:36.363
A brother for little Cesare
at last.

41:43.037 --> 41:46.440
We did love our children,
did we not, my dear?

41:46.474 --> 41:48.642
To a fault.

41:58.653 --> 42:00.087
My God.

42:35.857 --> 42:37.925
Lucrezia!

42:43.765 --> 42:45.632
My darling.

42:57.345 --> 43:00.047
May I... hold?

43:07.855 --> 43:09.723
A boy.

43:09.857 --> 43:11.291
Yes.

43:16.464 --> 43:18.565
Your Holiness.

43:40.288 --> 43:42.389
We should
give thanks.

43:44.292 --> 43:47.394
Whom
should we thank?

43:47.462 --> 43:53.734
God.

43:53.835 --> 43:56.570
We should thank God

43:56.637 --> 44:01.208
for all the blessings
He has visited upon this,

44:01.242 --> 44:04.745
our family.

44:04.812 --> 44:07.481
He's beautiful.

44:07.582 --> 44:09.916
Mmm.
