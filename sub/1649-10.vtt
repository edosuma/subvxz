00:02.628 --> 00:04.664
(wind blowing)

00:15.141 --> 00:17.302
(growling)

01:01.020 --> 01:03.352
(grunting)

01:13.366 --> 01:15.948
(theme music playing )

01:50.945 --> 01:53.982
( insects chittering )

02:35.698 --> 02:37.359
I thought we were
going further.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.035
We are.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.238
18 miles out.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.698
So why are we stopping?

02:50.338 --> 02:52.078
I wanted to talk.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.544
Been waiting a week
till we were gonna do this.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.260
- | just want to talk.
- We don't need to.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.176
We do.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.013
No, man, we don't.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.519
We're doing this.
| get it.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.771
He was passed out when
y'all brought him back,

03:10.941 --> 03:12.397
doesn't know
where the farm is.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.399
That isn't what I need
to talk to you about.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.408
I heard

03:23.579 --> 03:26.070
what really happened
at the school.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.039
(sighs)

03:29.210 --> 03:31.246
Was it to survive?

03:34.256 --> 03:35.917
Yeah.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.795
One of us wasn't
gonna make it out.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.005
It had to be him.

03:43.349 --> 03:47.183
One shot to the leg,
Carl lives.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.682
Reality is...

03:53.359 --> 03:55.771
he had no business
being here.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.029
Or there.
Whatever.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.786
You don't think
I would've done it?

04:07.957 --> 04:09.413
No, man, I know
you wouldn't have.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.541
You don't think I can keep
Lori or Carl safe?

04:13.546 --> 04:15.377
I didn't say that.

04:15.548 --> 04:17.209
Or my baby?

04:17.383 --> 04:19.419
Is it gonna
have to be me, too?

04:19.593 --> 04:22.175
Rick, you can'tjust be the good
guy and expect to live.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.053
Okay? Not anymore.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.385
I'm not
the good guy anymore.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.306
To save Carl's life,

04:31.480 --> 04:33.516
I would've done anything.
Anything.

04:33.691 --> 04:36.182
Now Lori says
you're dangerous,

04:36.360 --> 04:38.646
but you're not
gonna be dangerous.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.982
Not to us, not to me,

04:41.157 --> 04:42.897
not anymore.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.613
How about
you look at me?

04:52.501 --> 04:54.287
You and Lori--

04:57.840 --> 04:59.831
| get what happened.

05:01.844 --> 05:04.256
When I figured it out--
and I figured it out pretty quickly--

05:04.430 --> 05:06.591
I wanted
to break yourjaw,

05:06.765 --> 05:09.677
let you choke
on your teeth.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.514
But I didn't.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.563
That wasn't weakness.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.183
It took everything.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.736
That is my wife.
That is my son.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.775
That is my unborn child.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.491
I will stay alive
to keep them alive.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.296
You don't love her.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.335
You think you do,
but you don't.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.182
Now the only way
you and me keep on...

05:54.188 --> 05:57.646
is that you accept everything
ljust said right here, right now,

05:57.816 --> 06:00.523
and we move forward
with that understanding.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.162
When it started
it was just--

06:19.797 --> 06:22.083
it was a couple
of weird stories on the news.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.004
Then it was so quick.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.673
Everything--
itjust happened.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.430
Two weeks later
I'm in the hospital

06:35.604 --> 06:37.595
and there were soldiers shooting
people in the halls.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.684
They were shooting people,
man, not walkers.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.894
Then the walkers
came through.

06:43.279 --> 06:45.520
You know,
I tried to get you out.

06:45.698 --> 06:48.656
I tried, but we weren't
gonna make it.

06:48.826 --> 06:51.158
Man, there was no way
and I knew it.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.364
But I couldn't live with it.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.492
I couldn't live, knowing--

06:56.667 --> 06:59.204
(sighs)
But I had to.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.836
I didn't keep Lori
and Carl alive, man.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.543
They kept me alive.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.255
I want you to know that
I didn't look at her before that.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.425
Brother, if I could
take it all back, I would.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.097
I wanna check the ropes.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.273
-( loud rock music playing )
-( Randall grunting)

07:41.629 --> 07:43.665
( music continues)

07:44.798 --> 07:46.334
( muffled )
It's all good.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.839
( Randall whimpers)

07:52.765 --> 07:55.177
Rick say anything to you about Glenn
when they got back from town?

07:55.351 --> 07:57.763
Just that it had
gotten pretty bad.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.053
He's not the same.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.732
Says he froze.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.733
Blames me.
Says I got inside his head.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.770
He came back--
that's what matters.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.402
Men have to do certain things--
you know that--

08:12.576 --> 08:15.238
and they're either gonna
blame the little woman

08:15.412 --> 08:17.448
as the reason they do 'em
or the reason they don't.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.534
I'll tell you something--
what happens out there

08:19.708 --> 08:22.199
happens out there.
And we--

08:23.962 --> 08:26.123
we're just trying to keep it together
till they get back.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.710
- Things were good. Maybe |--
- Glenn's a big boy.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.875
He makes his own choices.
I mean, do you--

08:31.053 --> 08:33.044
do you have anything
to apologize for?

08:37.643 --> 08:39.679
Tell him to man up
and pull himself together.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.435
Just don't say, "Man up."

08:42.606 --> 08:44.813
( laughs )
It never goes well.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.442
Let me just
get this to Beth.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.729
You go on. I got it.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.290
Rick: We've gotta start
using our knives more.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.667
If there's one walker,

09:05.838 --> 09:07.294
we use our knives.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.716
We keep things quiet.
We save ammunition.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.128
Yeah.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.588
We need dry goods
ahead of the winter--

09:14.763 --> 09:17.345
warm clothes, fuel.

09:17.516 --> 09:20.007
Maybe we get a break.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.642
You gotta think
the cold affects them.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.858
If it doesn't kill 'em,
it's gotta slow 'em down.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.311
The second week
of January last year,

09:29.486 --> 09:31.397
we got all that
snow and ice.

09:31.572 --> 09:35.315
My cousin got stuck
on 85 for 24 hours.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.574
Sitting in his car
with a birthday cake

09:37.745 --> 09:39.576
for his girlfriend
at Georgia Tech.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.612
He just sat
and ate birthday cake

09:41.790 --> 09:45.328
and listened to the "Lord
of the Rings" book on tape.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.539
We get lucky, we get the same
winter as last year.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.835
By December,
it's a different world.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.466
Safer.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.962
Maybe we find some snowmobiles
to make runs.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.801
Yeah, sounds good.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.352
( door opens)

10:13.530 --> 10:15.066
Lori:
Knock, knock.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.955
How about this--
you,uhn

10:25.125 --> 10:27.207
you eat up all your food,
we'll get you up and out of here

10:27.377 --> 10:28.708
and go take a walk.
What do you say?

10:28.879 --> 10:31.086
lt'll do good
to be outside.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.670
You're pregnant?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.677
How could you do that?

10:42.601 --> 10:44.762
Uh, I don't really
have a choice.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.514
You think it'll make
a difference?

10:51.693 --> 10:53.229
Of course it will.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.439
You eat something.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.867
It's more than 18.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.582
Yeah, I'm looking
for a place.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.543
A place for what?

11:16.718 --> 11:19.300
Give him a fair shake.
A shot.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.409
There.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.036
This'll do.

12:28.206 --> 12:32.074
We'll leave the boy here,
scavenge some supplies.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.706
Psst
Over there.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.917
(growling)

12:42.471 --> 12:45.053
- ( gun cocks )
- Wait.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.923
Like I said.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.733
(snarling )

13:09.915 --> 13:11.200
Gun's quick, easy,

13:11.375 --> 13:13.912
but other ways to do this.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.667
- ( walker growling )
- One more. Your turn.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.052
- ( metal creaks )
-( liquid splashing)

14:59.941 --> 15:03.183
Hey, Rick.
( grunting )

15:05.489 --> 15:07.320
I don't see any bites.

15:07.491 --> 15:10.278
Gotta be scratches then--

15:10.452 --> 15:12.067
this one's hand,

15:12.245 --> 15:14.622
other one's cheek.

15:16.208 --> 15:20.121
They had walkers here--
burned bodies down the hill.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.413
I guess it gotta
be scratches then, huh?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.432
( muffled rock music playing )

15:42.150 --> 15:43.936
(grunting)

15:49.783 --> 15:52.741
- ( crying )
-( knocks on door)

15:55.247 --> 15:56.612
Haven't eaten a thing, huh?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.826
- You're gonna--
- ( crying continues)

16:05.507 --> 16:07.122
Hey.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.876
I know how hard it is.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.597
I tried for days to reach my mom
and get her on the phone.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.225
It's just so pointless.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.307
Oh.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.346
You have Maggie

16:23.525 --> 16:26.642
and your father
and Patricia and Jimmy.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.233
And you've gotta
stay strong for them.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.948
lwish I could promise you
it would be all right in the end.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.328
I can't,

16:38.498 --> 16:42.082
but we can make now
all right.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.792
And we have to.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.457
Thank you.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.136
I'll be right back.
We'll go take that walk.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.231
( exhales deeply )

17:14.034 --> 17:15.365
( fork clatters )

17:15.535 --> 17:17.241
Beth?

17:22.834 --> 17:24.495
You give it to me,
sweetheart.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.921
You don't
wanna do this.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.897
Andrea, have you seen
Maggie or Hershel?

17:51.071 --> 17:53.733
I haven't seen Hershel, but I saw
Maggie and Glenn walk by

17:53.907 --> 17:55.647
- maybe 20 minutes ago.
- Could you find her for me?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.690
- I've gotta get back to the house.
- Of course.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.826
- ( muffled music playing )
- ( groaning )

18:05.585 --> 18:07.792
(grunts)

18:10.006 --> 18:11.837
(whimpers)

18:13.802 --> 18:15.838
- What the hell is this?
- ( music stops)

18:19.140 --> 18:21.631
Oh, come on,
don't be stupid.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.846
I owe you guys.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.477
I can help protect
what you've got.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.606
Why would you save my life just
to kill me by leaving me here?

18:29.776 --> 18:33.143
One guy-- one guy
can't make it alone.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.312
That's why I was
with those dudes-- l was alone.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.445
Don't be stupid!
I'm not like them!

18:41.746 --> 18:43.737
I'm just some guy.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.123
| used to watch football
and screw around on the internet.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.784
I lived with my mom!

18:48.962 --> 18:51.453
I lost her
like you lost people.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.168
I went to school with Maggie,
for God's sake!

19:01.266 --> 19:03.097
I went to church.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.179
I rode the bench
on varsity baseball.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.345
- You went to school with Maggie?
- Did you go to school with Maggie?

19:08.523 --> 19:11.435
- Answer the question!
- Did you go to school with Maggie?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.474
|-- it--
she didn't know me.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.814
Didn't even know
I existed.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.606
I mean, I knew her.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.820
I knew who her dad was.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.535
There is no way

19:24.706 --> 19:26.116
I would ever do anything

19:26.291 --> 19:28.498
- to hurt her or her family.
-Jesus.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.283
Or you.
Or your people.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.670
I'm not like the guys
I was with!

19:33.840 --> 19:35.705
(whispering )
He knows where the farm is, Rick.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.966
Where we are.
He knows.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.843
Say he finds his way
back to his people...

19:48.063 --> 19:49.803
- Shane, no!
- ( gunshot)

19:49.981 --> 19:53.098
Not now.
Just not now.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.191
Well, when, Rick? When?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.402
( clatters )

20:03.078 --> 20:05.194
When I've had a chance
to think about it.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.910
- Don't let him kill me. Please, don't.
- Shut up!

20:12.003 --> 20:13.834
We're going back.
It's a man's life.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.417
I need a night
to think it through.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.422
You're gonna bring
this piece of garbage--

20:18.593 --> 20:21.050
this piece
of garbage who--

20:21.221 --> 20:22.552
he shot at you, Rick.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.053
He ran with men
who tried to kill you.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.089
You gonna bring him back
to where Lori sleeps?

20:26.267 --> 20:29.430
- To where Carl sleeps?
- He'll be locked up in the barn.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.562
- Unless you bust it open.
- Oh, don't start that shit.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.563
- I'm taking the night.
- Man, you take that--

20:34.734 --> 20:37.271
you think on it, Rick.
Keep struggling with it.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.437
It ain't hard, man. The right choice
is the one that keeps us alive.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.606
It's always the same with you.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.196
It's like the first moment--
it's whenever you're put to the test.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.282
Stop acting like you know the way
ahead, like you know the rules.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.118
There are no rules, man.
We're lost.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.953
No, no, no, man.
I know exactly where I am.

20:53.128 --> 20:55.210
- You don't know shit anymore.
- I don't think you can do it, Rick.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.122
- It's my call, man.
- I don't think you can keep them safe.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.802
( both grunting )

21:15.442 --> 21:17.854
( panting )

21:28.580 --> 21:28.614
( both grunting )

21:28.621 --> 21:30.407
( both grunting )

21:49.809 --> 21:50.969
Ah!

21:51.144 --> 21:53.635
- ( panting )
- Rick: Damn!

21:53.813 --> 21:55.724
Oh, God!

22:07.368 --> 22:09.029
No!

22:12.540 --> 22:14.280
Get off me, man.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.056
( panting )

22:44.572 --> 22:46.233
You're not doing this!

22:47.909 --> 22:50.616
You don't get to make
these calls anymore.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.403
-( both panting )
- I won't let you.

22:58.628 --> 22:59.959
(yells)

23:17.146 --> 23:19.808
(walker growling )

23:36.165 --> 23:38.201
(walkers growling )

23:58.271 --> 24:01.308
Maggie: Are you crazy?
What if Dad finds out?

24:01.482 --> 24:03.814
What's he gonna do?
Kill me for committing suicide?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.939
Stop being such a brat.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.615
He'd die.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.363
So would I.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.029
This isn't
just about you.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.489
We all lost Mom.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.905
May lose each other,
and I couldn't stand that.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.914
So you give up?

24:23.338 --> 24:25.329
(growling continues)

24:43.358 --> 24:45.519
(growling)

24:56.871 --> 24:58.077
( snarls )

25:11.344 --> 25:13.551
(grunts)

25:13.721 --> 25:16.554
Come on, bitch.
Let's see what you got. Come on.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.142
(grunting)

25:25.858 --> 25:27.894
(Maggie and Beth arguing )

25:38.413 --> 25:40.199
Where's Hershel?

25:40.373 --> 25:42.455
Maggie doesn't want him
to find out yet.

25:44.127 --> 25:46.413
It's a family affair.
We'll let them work it out.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.293
That's working it out?

25:48.464 --> 25:50.455
When Beth stops fighting,
that's when it's time to worry.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.208
(arguing continues)

25:53.386 --> 25:55.593
Maggie:
You are being so selfish!

25:55.763 --> 25:57.754
This could've
been handled better.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.548
How so?

26:00.727 --> 26:02.934
You shouldn't have
taken the knife away.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.979
- Excuse me?
- You were wrong.

26:07.150 --> 26:10.438
Like Dale taking my gun.
That wasn't your decision.

26:12.405 --> 26:13.941
She has to choose
to live on her own.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.980
She has to find
her own reasons.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.444
Want me to tie
a noose for her?

26:17.618 --> 26:19.449
If she's serious,
she'll figure out a way.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.781
Doesn't mean
I can't stop her

26:21.956 --> 26:23.321
or let her know
that I care.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.784
That has nothing
to do with it, Lori.

26:24.959 --> 26:27.120
She only has so many choices
in front of her,

26:27.295 --> 26:29.627
and she believes
the best one is suicide.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.833
- That's not an option.
- Of course it is.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.590
She doesn't need to be yelled at
or treated like a child.

26:34.761 --> 26:37.002
She needs
a loaded gun, right?

26:37.180 --> 26:38.795
You'll understand if
I don't send you in there.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.474
I came through it.

26:40.641 --> 26:43.348
And became such a productive
member of the group.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.475
- Let Maggie handle this her way.
- I contribute.

26:45.646 --> 26:47.557
| help keep
this place safe.

26:49.692 --> 26:52.479
The men can handle this on their own.
They don't need your help.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.442
I'm sorry.
What would you have me do?

26:57.617 --> 26:59.858
Oh, there's plenty
of work to go around.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.947
Are you serious?

27:02.121 --> 27:04.498
Everything falls apart, you're in
my face over skipping laundry?

27:05.833 --> 27:07.539
Puts a burden
on the rest of us,

27:07.710 --> 27:10.702
on me and Carol
and Patricia and Maggie.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.461
Cooking and cleaning
and caring for Beth.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.372
And you--

27:14.550 --> 27:16.336
you don't care about
anyone but yourself.

27:16.511 --> 27:17.626
You sit up on that RV,

27:17.804 --> 27:19.669
working on your
tan with a shotgun in your lap.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.341
No, lam on watch
against walkers.

27:24.519 --> 27:27.226
That is what matters, not fresh
mint leaves in the lemonade.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.227
And we are
providing stability.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.855
We are trying to create
a life worth living.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.982
Are you kidding me?

27:34.153 --> 27:37.862
Look, I went after Rick.
I took down two walkers.

27:38.032 --> 27:40.694
After crashing Maggie's car.
Ever apologize for that?

27:41.786 --> 27:43.492
Crashing her--

27:43.663 --> 27:46.075
- You're insane.
- No, you are.

27:46.249 --> 27:47.989
And you're the one
that's self-centered,

27:48.167 --> 27:50.078
the way you take it
all for granted.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.577
My husband is out there

27:52.755 --> 27:54.746
for the hundredth time.

27:54.924 --> 27:56.664
My son was shot.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.925
Don't you dare tell me
that I take this for granted.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.551
You don't get it,
do you?

28:00.721 --> 28:03.554
Your husband came back
from the dead, your son, too.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.555
And now you've
got a baby on the way.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.887
The rest of us have
piled up our losses--

28:08.062 --> 28:10.428
me, Carol, Beth-- but you just
keep on keeping on.

28:10.606 --> 28:11.812
We have all suffered.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.223
Playing house,
acting like the queen bee,

28:13.401 --> 28:15.392
laying down rules
for everybody but yourself.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.777
You know what?
Go ahead.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.233
Go in there and tell
that little girl

28:20.408 --> 28:22.899
that everything's gonna
be okay, just like it is for you.

28:23.077 --> 28:26.114
She'll get a husband,
a son, baby,

28:26.289 --> 28:27.904
boyfriend.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.125
She just has to look
on the bright side.

28:37.425 --> 28:38.790
(sighs)

28:45.808 --> 28:45.842
- ( walkers growling )
- ( grunts)

28:45.850 --> 28:48.683
- ( walkers growling )
- ( grunts)

29:03.117 --> 29:04.653
( groans )

29:29.310 --> 29:30.971
( gunshots)

29:31.145 --> 29:33.352
(gun clicks)

29:33.522 --> 29:35.513
( panting )

29:42.657 --> 29:44.693
(grunts)

29:54.085 --> 29:55.495
Mom would be ashamed

29:55.670 --> 29:57.706
to learn she raised
such a coward.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.914
- What about Dad, Beth?
- He's clueless.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.835
- He had us waiting for a cure.
- He knows he was wrong.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.469
When has Dad ever
admitted he was wrong?

30:07.640 --> 30:10.302
He's just telling Rick's group
what they want to hear.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.307
And Jimmy?

30:12.478 --> 30:15.470
We went out for three months
and now I'm married to him?

30:17.525 --> 30:19.186
And me?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.191
You could do that to me?

30:21.362 --> 30:23.569
I can't take
another funeral.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.196
You can't avoid it.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.702
What are we waiting for?

30:35.543 --> 30:37.829
- We should both do it.
- What?

30:38.004 --> 30:40.837
At the same time.
Help each other.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.213
- No.
- It's hard to do it.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.544
- No one wants to, but...
- No.

30:44.719 --> 30:45.708
- we could do it so it's easy.
- Stop talking like that.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.128
Our choice,
and then it would be over.

30:49.306 --> 30:52.890
Or we'll be forced to do it when
the farm and this house is overrun.

30:53.060 --> 30:56.143
- No one can protect us.
- That's not true.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.349
Who, Glenn?

30:59.817 --> 31:01.682
I heard what happened.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.068
Rick will save his family,

31:05.239 --> 31:07.275
the others, too.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.441
We're alone.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.326
You, me, Patricia,

31:13.497 --> 31:17.081
with only Dad and Jimmy
against a whole world of those things.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.576
I don't wanna be gutted.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.083
lwanna go...

31:28.929 --> 31:32.262
in this bed tonight...

31:33.392 --> 31:35.474
with you beside me.

31:38.773 --> 31:40.434
Please.

31:41.442 --> 31:43.478
(walkers growling )

31:46.280 --> 31:48.191
(grunting)

31:48.365 --> 31:50.492
(walker shrieks )

32:13.390 --> 32:15.255
Okay.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.941
You want some of that?

32:29.824 --> 32:32.816
- ( body thuds )
-( laughs ) Oh, shit.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.660
( knocks on door)

32:39.250 --> 32:41.241
(sighs)

32:42.336 --> 32:43.997
Hey.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.627
You can't sit on top of her.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.665
- I can't leave her by herself.
- You're gonna have to.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.672
You're exhausted.

32:52.847 --> 32:55.008
Go get some air.
|'|| sit with her.

32:55.182 --> 32:56.843
Go ahead.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.803
Wash up,
get something to eat.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.516
- I got it.
- Okay.

33:05.276 --> 33:06.356
Okay.

33:06.527 --> 33:08.518
- Thanks.
- Okay.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.542
Aren't you gonna
say something?

33:39.727 --> 33:41.888
(sighs)

33:46.066 --> 33:47.931
Is this what you want?

33:53.574 --> 33:55.781
The pain doesn't go away.

33:57.411 --> 33:59.572
You just make room for it.

34:11.050 --> 34:14.258
( door opens, shuts)

34:17.181 --> 34:19.172
- Stop!
- Holy shit.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.716
( both grunt)

34:21.894 --> 34:23.759
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

34:23.938 --> 34:25.269
What did you
expect me to do?

34:25.439 --> 34:27.020
Please,
just let me go, man.

34:27.191 --> 34:28.931
That's what
you came here for.

34:29.109 --> 34:32.067
- I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.
- Shut up.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.687
You wanna stay here?

34:34.865 --> 34:36.776
Help the guy that just tried
to bash your head in?

34:39.119 --> 34:40.370
There's 10 roamers there.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.448
You think you can
take that on?

34:42.623 --> 34:45.956
They don't see us.
We can get out of here.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.745
Fine. Fine!

34:51.924 --> 34:53.289
But let me have a gun.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.798
I'll help you.

34:54.969 --> 34:56.925
I'll show you.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.132
Let's go.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.262
- What?
- He did this.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.515
- We're going.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.477
Rick. Rick.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.643
Come back, man.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.120
Beth?

35:26.292 --> 35:28.123
( Beth sobbing )

35:28.294 --> 35:31.502
- Beth? Beth?
- ( glass shatters )

35:33.340 --> 35:36.082
- Maggie?
- She's in there. I heard glass.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.421
- ( knocks )
- Beth, you all right?

35:38.595 --> 35:40.005
Don't do this, Beth.
Don't do this.

35:40.180 --> 35:41.920
- Open up, please.
- ( sobbing continues)

35:42.099 --> 35:44.306
God, I left her
with Andrea.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.309
- Lori: Where's the key?
- I don't know.

35:48.439 --> 35:50.430
Beth, honey,
please open the door.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.144
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad, Beth.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.684
Maggie.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.693
- Hang on.
- ( creaking )

35:57.990 --> 36:00.356
-( poker clatters )
- ( sobbing continues)

36:02.536 --> 36:04.037
I'm sorry.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.497
Okay. It's okay.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.042
( panting )

36:18.886 --> 36:20.626
Stay there.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.490
All right.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.575
Come on, that's it.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.750
Yeah, you like that?

36:59.635 --> 37:01.341
(yells)

37:10.729 --> 37:12.435
Rick: Shane!

37:14.566 --> 37:15.817
- ( gunshots )
- Rick: Shane!

37:15.984 --> 37:17.690
Go for the back door!

37:17.861 --> 37:19.522
Come on!

37:24.701 --> 37:26.692
Come on, get in!

37:26.870 --> 37:29.782
Go, man, go!
Come on!

37:36.171 --> 37:38.207
(walkers growling )

37:43.095 --> 37:45.131
Whoo! Yeah!
Hell yeah!

37:45.305 --> 37:47.170
You see that?
You see what we did?

37:47.349 --> 37:49.556
Just keep driving.

37:50.811 --> 37:53.393
( panting )

38:03.115 --> 38:05.071
- Where were you?
- I heard. Is she all right?

38:05.242 --> 38:07.358
She would be if you had stayed
with her. Where were you?

38:07.536 --> 38:09.242
- How bad is she?
- It wasn't deep.

38:11.248 --> 38:14.240
She wants to live.
She made her decision.

38:14.418 --> 38:16.249
- She tried to kill herself.
- No, she didn't.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.502
My father is stitching
her wrist right now.

38:18.672 --> 38:20.663
She'll live.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.752
Stay away from her.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.587
From both of us.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.968
Don't you dare step foot
inside this house again.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.642
I'm not gonna say
she was right,

38:41.820 --> 38:43.776
but Beth has
made her choice.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.029
She want to live
and now she knows it.

38:47.409 --> 38:49.616
And sometimes you have to
cross the line.

39:09.264 --> 39:12.301
-( Randall breathing heavily )
-( rock music playing )

39:13.977 --> 39:16.013
( Randall moaning )

39:34.081 --> 39:36.072
(whimpering)

39:45.425 --> 39:47.461
If you want to kill me,

39:47.636 --> 39:49.422
you're gonna have to do
better than a wrench.

39:53.350 --> 39:56.934
Probably gonna
have to kill that boy.

39:59.189 --> 40:01.145
But I am gonna
think about it a night.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.023
It can't be that easy,
killing someone,

40:04.194 --> 40:06.401
killing anyone.

40:07.531 --> 40:09.362
You know that.

40:16.957 --> 40:19.243
That is my wife.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.126
That is my son.

40:24.339 --> 40:25.795
That is my child.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.631
If you're gonna be with us,

40:32.806 --> 40:35.593
you gotta follow my lead,
you gotta trust me.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.235
It's time
for you to come back.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.745
(music playing )

41:05.213 --> 41:07.704
J‘ I am nothing J‘

41:07.883 --> 41:09.999
J‘ Without pretend J‘

41:10.177 --> 41:12.509
J‘ I know my faults J‘

41:12.679 --> 41:16.763
J‘ Can't live with them J‘

41:16.933 --> 41:18.639
J‘ I am nothing J‘

41:18.810 --> 41:20.801
J‘ Without a man J‘

41:20.979 --> 41:23.095
J‘ I know my thoughts J‘

41:23.273 --> 41:28.643
J‘ But I can't hide them J‘

41:42.668 --> 41:47.128
J‘ I don't need
another friend J‘

41:47.297 --> 41:49.629
J‘ When most of them J‘

41:49.800 --> 41:53.418
J‘ I can barely
keep up with them J‘

41:53.595 --> 41:57.713
J‘ Perfectly able
to hold my own hand J‘

41:57.891 --> 41:58.425
J‘ But I still can't kiss J‘

41:58.433 --> 42:00.549
J‘ But I still can't kiss J‘

42:00.727 --> 42:03.810
J‘ My own neck. J‘
