WEBVTT

01:07.129 --> 01:08.798
My grandfather always taught me

01:08.863 --> 01:11.267
that it's important
to play by the rules.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.572
Unfortunately, he never mentioned what
to do when the rules don't quite apply.

01:15.636 --> 01:18.974
Free Forrest Bingham!
Free Forrest Bingham!

01:19.037 --> 01:22.443
Free Forrest Bingham!
Free Forrest Bingham!

01:22.507 --> 01:25.178
Free Forrest Bingham!
Free Forrest Bingham!

01:27.478 --> 01:28.713
Here they come!

01:28.778 --> 01:30.413
Carol! Carol Baldwin! Over here.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.351
Ms. Baldwin, are you worried about the
defense that Forrest Bingham will mount?

01:33.415 --> 01:35.815
We're very pleased with the case
the prosecution has presented

01:35.817 --> 01:37.486
and we're certain that it
will stand up against

01:37.552 --> 01:38.854
anything that the defense
can throw against us.

01:38.919 --> 01:42.225
We've heard that you've received death
threats. Can you substantiate that?

01:42.289 --> 01:43.959
Absolutely not.
Those are just rumors.

01:44.023 --> 01:46.995
Oh, but you have received phone
calls, angry ones from the public?

01:49.094 --> 01:52.132
Look! Look. Now, I am
well aware that my office

01:52.196 --> 01:54.701
is prosecuting a man
who is enormously popular.

01:54.765 --> 01:58.370
However, popularity is not
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.

01:58.434 --> 02:01.138
Right. That's all for today.
Thank you.

02:01.203 --> 02:05.176
Free Forrest Bingham! Free Forrest Bingham!
Free Forrest Bingham.

02:07.707 --> 02:09.842
Come on, let's go.

02:09.907 --> 02:13.180
I can't believe I said that, that
"Popularity is not guaranteed by..."

02:13.245 --> 02:15.916
Woody, stand there
and talk to them!

02:16.847 --> 02:18.984
It doesn't make any sense.

02:19.049 --> 02:20.684
Oh, my God!
The inauguration speech.

02:20.751 --> 02:23.754
Hey! Wait! I stole it from
the Governor's speech.

02:24.754 --> 02:26.891
Listen, I was just leaving,
I didn't have any change.

02:26.956 --> 02:29.459
There's no need to write this up.
Have a nice day.

02:29.890 --> 02:31.493
$68!

02:31.559 --> 02:33.863
I was just here five minutes!
I'm gonna fight this.

02:36.129 --> 02:38.666
People, please, let's
be adults about this.

02:38.730 --> 02:41.468
- Free Forrest Bingham!
- Free Forrest Bingham!

02:41.533 --> 02:45.039
Free Forrest Bingham! Free Forrest Bingham!
Free Forrest Bingham!

02:45.102 --> 02:47.572
You're gonna pay for this!
Come back here!

02:47.904 --> 02:50.308
You haven't heard
the last of us, honey!

02:50.738 --> 02:53.643
That's it, I know that's
where I heard it.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.646
The press is gonna have
a field day with this one.

02:56.711 --> 02:59.916
"Beleaguered Bingham
faces Plagiarist Prosecutor."

03:00.047 --> 03:03.285
Oh, Thomas, why do I let them
rattle me like that?

03:07.886 --> 03:11.224
"By the Constitution."
That's not what I said.

03:11.288 --> 03:14.493
Do you think they'll think
that's what I said?

03:14.557 --> 03:16.360
Thomas, what are you looking at?

03:16.426 --> 03:18.195
Nothing.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.895
What? Oh!

03:19.960 --> 03:21.863
They... They hit
the car with those eggs.

03:21.929 --> 03:23.932
Oh, just a couple.

03:24.031 --> 03:26.402
Well, Thomas, you have to stop right
now, you've gotta wash that off.

03:26.466 --> 03:28.803
Carol, it's nothing.
Really. Nothing?

03:28.867 --> 03:33.007
Do you know that those eggs may
permanently mar the finish on this car?

03:33.071 --> 03:34.908
And Higgins will tar and
feather you for that one.

03:34.972 --> 03:36.307
Will you forget about Higgins?

03:36.374 --> 03:38.644
Here.

03:38.942 --> 03:42.681
The important thing is that we got
you away from that angry crowd.

03:42.745 --> 03:45.784
Which kind of brings up something I've
been meaning to talk to you about.

03:45.847 --> 03:48.685
$68? For what?

03:48.750 --> 03:51.421
See, I've been thinking that
maybe it's not a good idea

03:51.485 --> 03:53.245
for you to stay at your
place alone right now.

03:53.253 --> 03:54.855
"Blocking an emergency
facility...

03:54.921 --> 03:56.723
There was the tire slashing incident...
"parking too close

03:56.788 --> 03:57.890
"to a fire hydrant...

03:57.956 --> 03:59.992
and the phone calls. "...And
encroaching on a bike lane."

04:00.057 --> 04:01.960
Oh, Thomas, I hope
you're gonna fight this.

04:02.026 --> 04:05.599
Will you forget about the ticket?
It's no big deal, Carol.

04:06.061 --> 04:10.101
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
The eggs are no big deal?

04:10.165 --> 04:12.969
Higgins, don't worry about him?
Forget about the ticket?

04:13.034 --> 04:14.269
What's going on here?

04:14.335 --> 04:18.541
Well, I just kinda thought it would be a
good idea to play it on the safe side.

04:18.605 --> 04:21.442
You know, I think you should
move out until the trial's over.

04:21.507 --> 04:25.146
To a kind of more secure place.

04:25.777 --> 04:28.348
You are such a sweetheart,
do you know that?

04:28.412 --> 04:31.383
But I can't stay at the estate.
You're a key witness.

04:31.447 --> 04:33.651
And the press would go
crazy with that one.

04:33.716 --> 04:38.324
Exactly. And that is why I have
found another place for you.

04:38.385 --> 04:39.788
Another place?

04:39.854 --> 04:43.727
A terrific place. A place
you are going to love.

04:43.790 --> 04:47.197
So we'll just stop by your
place and pack a bag.

04:47.260 --> 04:50.865
What? Why are you so suspicious?
What is it?

04:50.928 --> 04:52.430
An occupational hazard?

04:52.498 --> 04:55.569
Just give this new
place a chance, okay?

04:56.600 --> 04:59.104
Okay, I'll take a look at it.

04:59.168 --> 05:02.273
But I think that you ought to stop
and wash those eggs off your car.

05:02.337 --> 05:05.475
Forget about the eggs! I'm
not worried about the eggs!

05:12.812 --> 05:15.049
Well, I knew Thomas
had cooked something up.

05:15.113 --> 05:19.086
I just never suspected that he'd be
in collusion with my very own mother.

05:19.183 --> 05:21.854
Well, you sound as if we
were conspiring against you.

05:21.918 --> 05:23.120
Well?

05:23.186 --> 05:25.857
Well, darling, it's
only for your own good.

05:25.921 --> 05:27.590
We're both very
concerned about you.

05:27.656 --> 05:29.793
Now, Mother.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.463
Right now you look
exactly like Leo.

05:34.361 --> 05:36.330
You certainly are your
father's daughter.

05:36.530 --> 05:41.337
Mama, listen to me. You don't
have to worry about me, really.

05:41.399 --> 05:43.736
Well, it's not only those
threatening phone calls.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.573
I know you've gotta
expect those. But...

05:46.638 --> 05:48.807
This is a very demanding case.

05:48.871 --> 05:51.375
You shouldn't have to come home
every night to an empty house.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.076
I'm so glad Thomas convinced
you to come home.

05:54.142 --> 05:56.613
Oh, I didn't have
to do much convincing.

05:56.711 --> 05:58.213
She thought it
was a terrific idea.

05:58.279 --> 06:01.952
Oh yeah, I would have if you'd
ever told me what you were up to.

06:02.048 --> 06:04.352
Why didn't you just say that you
were bringing me to my mother's?

06:04.417 --> 06:06.219
No reason. Thank you for
bringing up the bags.

06:06.285 --> 06:08.222
You wanna take them to Carol's room?
Okay.

06:08.286 --> 06:10.356
Actually, the guest room
has a lot more space.

06:10.421 --> 06:12.257
And I've got a lot of work, and
I need to spread out, Mom.

06:12.322 --> 06:13.625
You don't want
to stay in your own room?

06:13.690 --> 06:16.529
No, of course. My room is fine.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.831
No, no, no, no. The guest
room is bigger and sunnier.

06:19.894 --> 06:21.096
It's really very cheerful.

06:21.162 --> 06:23.466
Mother, if you want me to
stay in my room, I'll stay.

06:23.531 --> 06:25.735
I just want you to be happy.
You decide.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.636
She'll stay in the guest room.

06:40.310 --> 06:41.512
Magnum!

06:44.479 --> 06:45.882
Magnum, how could you?

06:45.948 --> 06:47.015
How could I what?

06:47.081 --> 06:49.118
You know perfectly well
what I'm talking about.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.386
I do?

06:51.451 --> 06:54.590
Uh, well, things just kind
of got out of control.

06:54.654 --> 06:56.890
So you simply fled the scene.

06:56.955 --> 06:59.159
I wouldn't call it fleeing.
More like orderly retreat.

06:59.224 --> 07:01.895
A gentleman doesn't retreat
in the face of such distress.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.796
Anyway, I got it all off.
Miss Babcock was so upset,

07:03.861 --> 07:05.530
I allowed her to wait for
you in the guest house.

07:05.596 --> 07:08.467
Miss Babcock? Are you telling
me you don't know Miss Babcock?

07:08.531 --> 07:09.866
Miss Babcock?

07:09.931 --> 07:12.268
Of course I know Miss Babcock. She's
waiting for me in the guest house.

07:12.334 --> 07:13.435
What did you say?

07:13.501 --> 07:14.603
I said, "Of course
I know Miss Babcock."

07:14.669 --> 07:16.371
No. Earlier.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.140
What are you hiding?

07:19.205 --> 07:20.874
Hiding, Higgins?
Hiding? Nothing.

07:20.939 --> 07:23.009
There's something wrong with the Ferrari.
That's ridiculous.

07:23.075 --> 07:24.977
I order you to stand aside.

07:25.043 --> 07:26.645
You're going to feel
very silly about this.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.147
Immediately!

07:34.417 --> 07:37.354
I can't believe it.
I can explain.

07:37.419 --> 07:40.055
You...

07:40.120 --> 07:41.856
You've washed the car.

07:43.223 --> 07:45.293
It's clean.

07:47.026 --> 07:48.528
You've had it washed.

07:48.628 --> 07:50.797
Well I was gonna
surprise you, but...

07:52.663 --> 07:54.800
How extraordinary.

07:57.066 --> 07:59.103
Why would you do such a thing?

08:03.605 --> 08:05.245
What did you mean
by "I got it all off"?

08:05.306 --> 08:07.810
Look, I don't wanna keep
Miss Babcock waiting.

08:08.309 --> 08:09.443
Magnum!

08:11.411 --> 08:13.815
What happened to the car?

08:21.652 --> 08:24.923
Oh! You're here! Great!

08:24.986 --> 08:26.823
Everything's ready.

08:26.889 --> 08:27.924
Miss Babcock?

08:27.989 --> 08:31.362
Please, call me Brenda. Some pâté?
No, thanks.

08:31.493 --> 08:32.928
Ah. Caviar?

08:32.993 --> 08:34.159
No, really.

08:34.227 --> 08:35.263
Champagne?

08:35.328 --> 08:36.864
No. Nothing, thank you.

08:36.929 --> 08:39.366
Oh, you've gotta have something.

08:39.866 --> 08:42.937
I don't know what this is about,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.237
but this is my house!

08:45.870 --> 08:46.905
Yeah.

08:46.971 --> 08:49.876
You should've heard the story I had
to concoct for that guy at the gate

08:49.940 --> 08:51.442
to let me in here. Sit down!

08:51.508 --> 08:52.809
He said you were upset.

08:52.876 --> 08:54.979
Ah, I guess you're wondering
why I wanted to see you.

08:55.043 --> 08:56.078
That would be a good start, yes.

08:56.144 --> 08:59.817
Okay. I wanna hire
you to find somebody

08:59.881 --> 09:00.881
for me.

09:00.947 --> 09:02.383
Oh.

09:02.449 --> 09:03.984
So, where do we start?

09:04.050 --> 09:06.020
Well, I have a little
problem with that, because

09:06.085 --> 09:10.725
I have this rule about
missing persons cases.

09:10.789 --> 09:13.492
I don't take them. What do you
mean you don't take them?

09:13.556 --> 09:15.326
I mean, you're a private
investigator, aren't you?

09:15.391 --> 09:17.494
Yes, but as a general
rule, I do not take...

09:17.560 --> 09:20.798
Okay, here's
the whole story. Okay.

09:20.862 --> 09:24.001
And this is me. A long
time ago, much younger,

09:24.065 --> 09:29.140
backup singer visiting Hawaii,
poor, starry-eyed, naive.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.471
Well, maybe not exactly naive,

09:31.537 --> 09:32.973
but impressionable,
impressionable.

09:33.038 --> 09:34.473
That's very interesting, but...

09:34.540 --> 09:36.542
And then there was him.

09:36.607 --> 09:41.449
See, rich, handsome,
sophisticated, older

09:41.511 --> 09:43.580
and married.

09:43.646 --> 09:46.050
And I got pregnant.

09:47.582 --> 09:50.586
I was scared, see, I
didn't know what to do.

09:50.652 --> 09:52.888
Well, yeah that's a tough
spot to be in. And then

09:52.953 --> 09:55.524
when he offered me money you know,
to have the kid and split...

09:55.588 --> 09:58.426
I know now that
it was a mistake.

09:58.490 --> 10:01.027
But at the time,
I just jumped at it.

10:01.092 --> 10:02.594
I just jumped right at it.

10:02.660 --> 10:03.928
That's okay, that's fine, sit down.
See?

10:03.994 --> 10:06.064
Okay, now. Jumped.

10:06.129 --> 10:09.834
There are already organizations
set up to find adopted children.

10:09.898 --> 10:11.968
You just need a birth certificate.
I don't have one.

10:12.034 --> 10:13.469
Okay, go to the courthouse.

10:13.534 --> 10:14.969
No, no, I've already been there.

10:15.036 --> 10:16.239
They don't have
a record of this birth.

10:16.304 --> 10:18.205
He was a very influential guy.

10:18.270 --> 10:21.409
Okay, all right. Well,
maybe I can help you

10:21.475 --> 10:23.444
find someone to help you.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.518
That's okay.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.823
You know, maybe I shouldn't have
gotten my hopes up, anyhow.

10:43.656 --> 10:45.993
It's just that...

10:50.495 --> 10:52.932
it's just that I
never saw my kid.

10:54.564 --> 10:56.467
I never got to hold him.

10:58.869 --> 11:02.107
If you had any kids, you'd
know what I was talking about.

12:39.143 --> 12:40.845
Come on.

12:52.752 --> 12:53.753
Are you all right?

12:54.088 --> 12:56.224
Yeah, just surprised me.

12:56.288 --> 12:58.557
I guess the kids are
shoring up the perimeters.

12:58.623 --> 12:59.925
I'm sorry, Mr...

13:00.225 --> 13:01.927
Magnum. Thomas Magnum.

13:01.993 --> 13:03.729
I'm O'Shea. What
can I do for you?

13:03.794 --> 13:06.966
I'm a private investigator. I'm
trying to locate a Father Patrick.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.734
That's me, or it was years ago.

13:09.799 --> 13:11.869
Although, as you can
see, I am a father.

13:11.934 --> 13:13.135
I want a piggy back.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.903
Ups-a-daisy.

13:18.739 --> 13:21.877
These are all yours?

13:22.775 --> 13:25.378
Angie, don't iump
so hard, sweetheart.

13:25.443 --> 13:28.515
Well, some of them are friends, but
seven or eight of them are mine.

13:28.579 --> 13:30.982
You won't tell the Pope?

13:31.782 --> 13:35.354
So, you're the Father Patrick that was
at the St. Agnes' Home? In the '50s?

13:35.417 --> 13:37.052
Right again. But how
did you know that?

13:37.153 --> 13:40.525
Father... No, Mr. O'Shea,

13:40.588 --> 13:43.693
I'm trying to find a birth certificate
for a woman who was at the home.

13:43.757 --> 13:47.296
She had a baby boy in September of '55.
Brenda Carmichael.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.995
- You remember her?
- Guess who?

13:49.061 --> 13:51.933
Angie, sweetheart,
your daddy can't see.

13:51.998 --> 13:56.638
Carmichael, you say? No, I don't
remember any of them, really.

13:56.700 --> 13:59.303
Now, Sister Michael, she's the one.
She was really close to the girls.

13:59.368 --> 14:00.404
She might remember.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.774
Well, I talked to her. She's
in a convalescent hospital.

14:02.838 --> 14:04.374
She doesn't remember too well.

14:04.439 --> 14:05.606
Sorry to hear that.

14:05.674 --> 14:07.275
Now, the doctor,
the doctor's name was...

14:07.308 --> 14:08.375
Dr. Kanesha. Yeah.

14:08.441 --> 14:09.944
He passed away
a couple years ago.

14:10.011 --> 14:11.847
Angie! That's hurting
your daddy, love.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.481
I'm sorry, I don't seem to be
much help to you, Mr. Magnum.

14:15.547 --> 14:18.152
Well, I appreciate
your trying. Hi, kids.

14:18.249 --> 14:20.218
Hi. Hi.

14:20.951 --> 14:22.921
Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong.

14:25.254 --> 14:27.023
Hey, wait a minute.

14:27.089 --> 14:28.624
Hey, look what Daddy has.

14:28.690 --> 14:30.326
What's in there, Dad?

14:30.458 --> 14:31.792
I wanna see, too.

14:31.993 --> 14:32.994
Ah-ha!

14:35.096 --> 14:37.399
I didn't know if
I still had this.

14:37.463 --> 14:38.898
What'd you say the date was?

14:38.965 --> 14:41.001
Uh... This is a journal I kept.

14:41.066 --> 14:44.138
I imagine the prose is rather flowery,
but the facts should be accurate.

14:44.202 --> 14:46.305
September 17th, 1955.

14:46.369 --> 14:49.808
17th. And the name
was Carmichael?

14:50.006 --> 14:51.342
Right.

14:52.508 --> 14:54.043
There's no mention of it here.

14:54.109 --> 14:56.813
I did record a birth that day.

14:56.878 --> 14:59.683
But it was a girl.
It's not that name.

14:59.781 --> 15:02.152
Could it be Babcock? Babcock...

15:02.215 --> 15:05.020
No, it's Baldwin.

15:05.085 --> 15:08.022
Carol Baldwin.

15:13.974 --> 15:16.578
I just don't understand
why you're so upset.

15:16.675 --> 15:17.877
First of all you lied to! Me!

15:17.943 --> 15:18.978
Oh, not about everything.

15:19.045 --> 15:21.882
Then I wasted a whole day
chasing around the island

15:21.946 --> 15:24.518
looking for a birth certificate
that never even existed.

15:24.582 --> 15:26.818
But we found the journal,
we've got proof.

15:26.883 --> 15:28.118
That's not the point.

15:28.184 --> 15:29.486
Then what is the point?

15:29.652 --> 15:31.589
The point is that
you conveniently

15:31.654 --> 15:34.592
left out some very important
parts of the story.

15:34.656 --> 15:36.625
Aha! Aha, what?

15:36.791 --> 15:38.593
That's what's really
bugging you, isn't it?

15:38.659 --> 15:41.129
It's not the lying.

15:41.193 --> 15:42.862
I'm not gonna talk about this.

15:42.929 --> 15:44.398
You just don't want to
be caught in the middle.

15:44.462 --> 15:46.032
That's got nothing
to do with it.

15:46.098 --> 15:47.900
You don't know how to tell
her any better than I do.

15:47.966 --> 15:49.134
And that's what's
making you mad.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.003
That is not what's making me mad,
and I am not gonna tell her.

15:52.068 --> 15:54.907
Well, somebody has to tell her, and
she probably won't believe me.

15:54.971 --> 15:56.373
Well, why should she?

15:56.438 --> 15:58.240
Well, that's the point.

15:58.306 --> 16:01.679
No, that is not the point!

16:02.609 --> 16:05.080
You don't think that she has
a right to know the truth?

16:05.145 --> 16:07.315
This is not exactly
a terrific time

16:07.379 --> 16:10.417
for her to find out that her
mother is not her mother.

16:10.481 --> 16:12.083
Now, she's in the middle
of an important trial.

16:12.150 --> 16:13.519
She's under a lot of pressure.

16:13.584 --> 16:15.888
There's never gonna
be a right time.

16:15.953 --> 16:19.492
She's been lied to for over 30 years.
That's long enough.

16:19.589 --> 16:21.325
And you were part of that lie.

16:24.225 --> 16:26.897
You gave her up,
you took the money.

16:43.940 --> 16:46.177
It's still a lie.

17:21.901 --> 17:23.637
Listen,

17:23.702 --> 17:25.672
I'm sure once you've had a
chance to think it over...

17:25.738 --> 17:29.778
Thinking it over's what got me into
this in the first place, Brenda.

17:45.085 --> 17:47.456
Oh, Thomas, you're too much.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.490
This is so sweet of you.
And I do appreciate it.

17:49.555 --> 17:51.024
But I think you're overdoing it.

17:51.090 --> 17:52.130
What are you talking about?

17:52.157 --> 17:53.518
Well, ever since
this case started,

17:53.525 --> 17:56.229
you've been picking me up,
you've chauffeured me around

17:56.294 --> 17:57.695
and now you're
taking me to lunch.

17:57.762 --> 18:00.600
Well, I am one of the state's key
witnesses. I have a vested interest

18:00.664 --> 18:02.967
in the well-being of the prosecutor.
Thank you.

18:03.032 --> 18:05.971
Oh, I'd like to order right away,
because we are in a hurry.

18:06.035 --> 18:08.239
Okay, I'll be right with you.
Thank you.

18:08.302 --> 18:10.172
Now, let's see, where were we?

18:10.238 --> 18:12.040
Oh, yes. You and my mother.

18:12.139 --> 18:14.476
Me and your mom? Yes. We were
talking about how you're both

18:14.540 --> 18:16.844
hovering over me. Hovering? L
wouldn't call it hovering.

18:16.909 --> 18:19.913
Concern, maybe. Care. You are
under a great deal of pressure.

18:20.412 --> 18:22.114
What? I don't...

18:22.180 --> 18:25.018
Okay, so maybe you're right.
Is it starting to show?

18:25.082 --> 18:28.187
Have you decided? I haven't
even looked at the menu yet.

18:28.251 --> 18:31.523
I'll come back. All right. Right
away, though, we're in a hurry.

18:31.586 --> 18:35.926
So being home with your mom probably
brings back old times, huh?

18:36.490 --> 18:37.791
Yeah. I guess so.

18:37.892 --> 18:40.629
You're probably sitting around
late at night, talking over things

18:40.693 --> 18:43.398
like you used to do
when you were a kid.

18:43.829 --> 18:46.366
Thomas, do you think that
I'm being too hard on her?

18:46.431 --> 18:48.500
I mean, you were there yesterday.
Was that verbal wrestling?

18:48.565 --> 18:50.368
Was that my fault?
Verbal wrestling?

18:50.434 --> 18:53.071
Because I love my mother.
I love her dearly.

18:53.136 --> 18:55.496
But all we seem to do lately is fight.
Have you noticed that?

18:55.538 --> 18:57.340
No more than usual.

18:57.405 --> 18:58.707
Have you decided?

18:58.773 --> 19:00.675
I don't know. I'll come back.

19:00.741 --> 19:03.947
No, no, no, your special.
Whatever it is, I don't care.

19:04.011 --> 19:05.480
Two.

19:05.713 --> 19:07.382
I hope it isn't something
with garlic and onions.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.882
So, I'll bet

19:09.115 --> 19:14.357
over the years you and your mom
have confided in each other a lot.

19:14.752 --> 19:16.754
Yeah, I guess so. What are
you getting at, Thomas?

19:16.820 --> 19:17.855
Nothing.

19:17.922 --> 19:19.658
Because you're acting
kind of weird.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.559
Carol, it's nothing at all.

19:21.623 --> 19:24.194
Well, yeah, I was
curious, that's all.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.497
I was just wondering,
oh, for instance,

19:26.794 --> 19:30.800
what kinds of things would your
mother confide in you in the past?

19:31.064 --> 19:33.601
I don't know. Actually, my
dad and I used to confide

19:33.666 --> 19:36.237
in each other much more
than my mother and I. Yeah?

19:36.302 --> 19:38.204
Oh, yes.

19:38.269 --> 19:40.339
I mean, I still drive out
to Aukai Point sometimes,

19:40.405 --> 19:42.709
the place where we used to go
when we'd talk things out.

19:42.773 --> 19:44.843
What kinds of things?

19:45.440 --> 19:47.243
Something is
definitely going on here.

19:47.310 --> 19:48.445
Carol, I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.614
You might as well tell me right now.
It's nothing.

19:50.712 --> 19:54.617
Thomas, you're gonna have to tell me
sooner or later. It's nothing, really.

19:54.681 --> 19:58.989
Okay, there's one little thing.
This is silly. But

19:59.785 --> 20:02.389
a friend of mine found out that
a friend of his... Specials.

20:02.453 --> 20:04.891
Liver with onions
and garlic toast.

20:07.391 --> 20:08.659
What were you saying?

20:08.725 --> 20:10.094
Nothing.

20:10.526 --> 20:11.728
Mmm.

20:22.836 --> 20:24.171
I think those are going
to be just fine.

20:24.238 --> 20:25.572
Hi.

20:25.637 --> 20:28.575
Thomas, what a nice surprise.

20:28.639 --> 20:30.909
I wanna talk to you about Carol.

20:30.975 --> 20:32.912
Yeah, well, that's
why I stopped by.

20:32.977 --> 20:35.681
See? I knew I wasn't the
only one worried about her.

20:35.745 --> 20:38.049
Abigail... She says
she's perfectly fine,

20:38.114 --> 20:40.685
but last night I woke up,
OO in the morning, really,

20:40.749 --> 20:43.820
and I came downstairs, there she
was, wide awake, going over briefs.

20:43.885 --> 20:45.487
She says she can't sleep.

20:45.552 --> 20:47.289
Of course, with all
the coffee she drinks,

20:47.355 --> 20:49.057
I don't know how
she can sleep at all.

20:49.122 --> 20:52.460
Thomas, would you talk to her
about taking care of herself?

20:52.524 --> 20:56.197
I talk till I'm blue in the face,
but she never listens to me.

20:59.463 --> 21:02.635
Does the name Brenda Babcock
mean anything to you?

21:08.069 --> 21:10.473
Oh, God.

21:12.006 --> 21:13.875
She's here in Honolulu.

21:18.544 --> 21:22.150
Oh, I'm gonna
have to stop pretending.

21:23.781 --> 21:27.587
See, I'd wanted a child so much,

21:29.152 --> 21:33.224
and when Leo told me
about his liaison,

21:35.890 --> 21:39.462
it seemed that bringing
the baby into our house...

21:39.559 --> 21:43.667
You don't owe me an explanation.
No, no, I want you to know.

21:43.729 --> 21:47.734
I went to the hospital,
and I took the baby,

21:48.934 --> 21:52.306
and I hoped to God I'd never
have to see that woman again.

21:53.870 --> 21:56.841
And I began to pretend
she was really mine.

21:57.639 --> 22:01.445
Oh, I supposed that some day,

22:01.510 --> 22:03.680
I knew she'd have to know.

22:06.012 --> 22:08.282
But I didn't know
how to tell her

22:08.348 --> 22:11.653
that her wonderful father
had been unfaithful to me.

22:12.784 --> 22:16.857
We paid her once.
Isn't this blackmail?

22:16.920 --> 22:21.395
Abigail, I really
think that she just

22:21.458 --> 22:23.494
wants to get to know Carol.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.864
Can you get me 24 hours?

22:28.530 --> 22:31.968
Until I can find a way
to tell Carol myself?

22:35.401 --> 22:37.203
I think I can do that.

22:38.769 --> 22:41.006
Can I get you something? Tea?

22:41.138 --> 22:42.640
No, thank you.

22:44.307 --> 22:45.943
Please excuse me.

23:18.132 --> 23:21.070
I told Mom I have to work
late after the trial.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.806
So she calls me at the office and
she says that it's very important

23:23.870 --> 23:25.472
that we talk tonight.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.140
Want some ice cream?

23:27.206 --> 23:28.608
No, I don't think so, thanks.

23:28.673 --> 23:32.045
The flavor of the month is
papaya-macadamia nut crunch.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.579
Yuck, sounds awful.

23:34.545 --> 23:37.149
So anyway, I ask her, "Mother,
what's this all about?"

23:37.214 --> 23:40.252
And she gets all stuttery, she can't
talk, and she hangs up the phone.

23:40.316 --> 23:41.685
Hi, can I help you?

23:41.816 --> 23:44.520
A scoop of peanut butter
chocolate, please.

23:44.618 --> 23:46.387
Wait a minute, I thought
that you wanted

23:46.453 --> 23:48.490
the papaya-macadamia nut crunch.

23:48.621 --> 23:51.892
No, I didn't want it.
I wanted you to try it.

23:51.957 --> 23:54.862
So, did she say what it was about?
Who?

23:54.927 --> 23:57.463
Your mom. Oh. My mother?
Yes. No.

23:57.528 --> 23:59.598
No, but I think I know. You do?

23:59.663 --> 24:03.236
Yes. It's the trial.
She's obviously very upset.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.937
I shouldn't even be staying with her.
It's just too hard on her.

24:06.001 --> 24:07.637
- Hi. Here you go.
- Thanks.

25:29.114 --> 25:31.717
I don't know, I just
hate feeling paranoid.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.116
And don't worry about yesterday.

25:33.182 --> 25:35.653
If that guy shows up
again, we'll get him.

25:36.252 --> 25:38.054
I know. I'm sorry, Thomas.

25:38.153 --> 25:40.589
I usually don't let that
stuff get to me, but

25:40.655 --> 25:43.126
having some creep
follow you around...

25:43.257 --> 25:44.926
I know. Yeah.

25:44.991 --> 25:47.795
So, how'd it go last night?

25:47.860 --> 25:49.897
How'd what go?

25:49.962 --> 25:52.633
Your talk with your mom. You
said she wanted to talk to you.

25:52.697 --> 25:53.799
Oh, Mom, yes.

25:53.865 --> 25:55.266
Well, it went fine.

25:55.333 --> 25:57.536
She's just worried about that
guy who's following me around.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.004
I probably shouldn't have
even told her about it.

26:00.069 --> 26:03.674
Anyway, she fixed this very special
nouvelle dinner for two, and we talked,

26:03.737 --> 26:07.210
we laughed about silly stuff we used
to do together, and I went to bed.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.610
That was it?

26:08.676 --> 26:10.045
Hey, Magnum!

26:12.511 --> 26:15.783
Hey, Magnum! Thomas Magnum!
Well, fancy meeting you here.

26:15.847 --> 26:16.915
Brenda.

26:16.982 --> 26:19.419
Say! I know you.
You're Carol Baldwin!

26:19.483 --> 26:22.019
You're prosecuting that...
That Forrest Bingham.

26:22.085 --> 26:23.922
Well, it's a pleasure
to shake your hand.

26:23.987 --> 26:25.288
You know, we need
more people like you

26:25.355 --> 26:27.959
to go after the Forrest
Binghams of the world.

26:28.023 --> 26:29.492
Yeah, she's really something.

26:29.557 --> 26:32.261
Say, you've been taking some kind
of beating in the press, huh?

26:32.326 --> 26:34.630
Well... Don't let that
stuff get you down.

26:34.695 --> 26:37.399
Believe me, if they think they smell
blood, they're gonna go in for the kill.

26:37.463 --> 26:40.267
You've just got to go and stare
them in the eye and let them know

26:40.332 --> 26:41.701
that you're alive and kicking.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.370
They'll slink off and they'll
go after some other victim.

26:44.435 --> 26:45.904
You think so?

26:45.969 --> 26:47.839
Just keep doing your job, honey.

26:47.905 --> 26:49.641
They can't hurt you
if you don't let them.

26:49.706 --> 26:52.510
You don't wanna be late. It's
nice seeing you again, Brenda.

26:52.574 --> 26:53.943
Bye-bye. Goodbye.

26:54.009 --> 26:56.813
Oh, and thanks for the pep talk.
I needed that.

26:56.877 --> 27:01.517
, Remember, walk tall
stand proud, and

27:01.581 --> 27:02.949
look them right in the eye.

27:03.015 --> 27:04.618
Right.

27:09.288 --> 27:11.759
Who was that? A client. She
had a necklace stolen,

27:11.822 --> 27:13.425
an heirloom. I tracked
it down for her.

27:13.490 --> 27:14.959
I like her attitude.

27:19.794 --> 27:22.632
Dirty Bart's Oboe,
five-two-seven.

27:22.696 --> 27:26.636
You've gotta be kidding. This is
my first day off in two weeks.

27:26.699 --> 27:30.272
Once I sit down, I am not
moving off of this pier.

27:30.336 --> 27:33.474
Come on, T.C. It was rented
at Big Tony's car rental!

27:33.537 --> 27:34.572
So?

27:34.638 --> 27:36.875
So, I just thought with

27:36.941 --> 27:39.044
your... What should I call it?

27:39.109 --> 27:41.246
"Reciprocal agreement"
with Big Tony...

27:41.311 --> 27:44.482
You know, his customers get a
ten-percent discount on your charters,

27:44.545 --> 27:48.351
and your customers get a ten-percent
discount on his car rentals.

27:48.416 --> 27:52.322
Are you implying that there's something
illegal or unethical about that?

27:52.385 --> 27:56.392
No. No. Not in the
strict legal sense. No.

27:56.455 --> 27:59.827
And I know that's not the reason
you'd call Big Tony for me, anyway.

28:02.726 --> 28:03.727
What is?

28:03.794 --> 28:05.531
Well, being a friend of Carol,

28:05.596 --> 28:08.266
I'm sure that you'd wanna
help her out if you knew

28:08.331 --> 28:11.269
there was something you could do
when people are following her around

28:11.333 --> 28:14.505
and making threatening phone calls.
I know you'd want to do that.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.539
This is the nut
that was following Carol?

28:17.604 --> 28:18.872
Uh, yes.

28:18.938 --> 28:20.674
Well, why didn't
you tell me that?

28:20.739 --> 28:24.378
You have the most frustrating habit
of talking all around something

28:24.443 --> 28:27.614
instead of coming right out and
saying what it is that you want.

28:31.882 --> 28:35.053
I'll bet you never knew I'd figured
that out about you and Big Tony.

28:35.117 --> 28:38.522
Did it ever occur to you that
life would be a lot easier

28:38.585 --> 28:41.223
if you'd just tell the truth?

28:41.722 --> 28:43.524
Hey, hello, Big Tony!

28:43.756 --> 28:45.626
How you doing?

28:45.691 --> 28:50.065
Listen, I need an address on one of
your clients. That's for the F.B.l.

29:17.781 --> 29:20.753
I don't know why you went to all
the trouble to track me down.

29:20.818 --> 29:24.457
Well, I... l just wanted
to see if you were okay.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.890
We didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

29:26.955 --> 29:29.326
You weren't that easy
to find, you know.

29:29.391 --> 29:31.728
I talked to the desk clerk
at the other hotel.

29:33.993 --> 29:35.730
He said you checked
out rather suddenly.

29:35.795 --> 29:37.130
Oh, that place.

29:37.198 --> 29:41.103
Listen, the thing is, this hotel
offered me a terrific rate,

29:41.233 --> 29:43.403
you know, if I'd do
a couple of sets a night.

29:43.468 --> 29:46.039
And so, I thought, as long
as I'm in Honolulu

29:46.103 --> 29:49.174
I might as well take advantage
of the opportunity.

29:49.272 --> 29:51.109
That was...

29:52.741 --> 29:56.012
I'm glad you didn't
tell Carol today.

29:56.911 --> 30:00.684
You know, I thought when I came here that
I was coming to get things straight.

30:00.747 --> 30:04.452
You know, to get what was rightfully mine.
My daughter.

30:04.517 --> 30:07.256
But you know who I saw
when I looked at her today?

30:07.320 --> 30:09.122
Leo.

30:09.187 --> 30:11.790
Can you believe it?

30:11.856 --> 30:14.160
I still miss him.

30:14.425 --> 30:16.327
I don't know. After seeing her,

30:16.426 --> 30:18.730
I don't know if I can
tell her, you know?

30:18.794 --> 30:21.900
Oh, I wanna get to know my
daughter more than anything.

30:22.430 --> 30:25.235
I don't know if I have the right

30:25.299 --> 30:29.105
to turn her world upside down.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.473
Listen,

30:33.371 --> 30:34.474
whatever you decide...

30:34.540 --> 30:37.176
Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna
ask you to tell her again.

30:37.308 --> 30:39.308
I didn't have the right to
put you in that position.

30:39.309 --> 30:41.846
I didn't think you were.

30:41.912 --> 30:43.781
Brenda,

30:43.846 --> 30:46.650
what I'm trying to say is,

30:48.149 --> 30:52.790
whatever you decide, I'm sure
you'll do what you feel is right.

31:37.420 --> 31:38.487
You looking for me, pally?

31:38.553 --> 31:39.821
Or me.

31:41.522 --> 31:44.594
All right, okay.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.696
What do you want? I want you
to tell your boss to lay off.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.598
Forrest Bingham isn't gonna
scare her out of doing her job.

31:51.062 --> 31:52.764
Forrest Bingham?

31:52.830 --> 31:55.434
This is absolutely the last
time I do this for you, Thomas.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.371
Look, I wasn't hired
by Forrest Bingham.

31:58.435 --> 32:01.406
My name is Keough Palmer.
I'm a private investigator.

32:01.470 --> 32:05.176
Then who hired you? Hey, I'm not
getting paid enough for this.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.409
You chase me three
blocks through a mall,

32:07.475 --> 32:10.046
you throw punches
at me in a garage.

32:10.110 --> 32:11.479
You guys are crazy.

32:11.545 --> 32:13.682
You wanna know who hired me?
Her mother.

32:13.746 --> 32:16.750
What? Okay, Palmer, you don't
have to say anything else.

32:16.815 --> 32:17.849
Give me a break, Palmer.

32:17.915 --> 32:19.595
You expect me to believe
that her own mother

32:19.649 --> 32:21.352
hired a P.l.
to follow her around?

32:21.419 --> 32:23.355
Rick, that's client
confidentiality.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.190
Hey, whose side are you on?

32:25.255 --> 32:26.957
Look, all I know is
there's some wacky babe

32:27.022 --> 32:28.591
running around
somewhere out there

32:28.723 --> 32:30.058
that wants to talk to you.

32:30.124 --> 32:32.595
Abigail Baldwin hired
me to keep them apart.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.496
That's all I know.

32:34.562 --> 32:37.133
You think I could have
my license back now?

32:37.497 --> 32:39.366
Okay, let's take your car.

32:39.432 --> 32:42.670
Hey, I told you once before I'd
never dress up like this again.

32:42.733 --> 32:45.205
And if it weren't for Carol here,
I'd never went for this stupid idea

32:45.270 --> 32:47.239
in the first place!

32:48.204 --> 32:49.941
Answer my questions.

32:50.006 --> 32:53.478
I can't stand this, Thomas. Are
you hiding something from me?

33:04.350 --> 33:06.287
I just wanna know what
in the hell is going on.

33:06.352 --> 33:09.324
Carol, this is between you and your mom.
I think you should talk to her.

33:11.722 --> 33:14.426
Who's in there? I wanted
permission to see her.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.728
I won't give it to you. Why not?

33:16.792 --> 33:21.166
Because I don't want her to learn about
your relationship with her father.

33:21.397 --> 33:23.566
Can't you understand that? Oh.

33:24.398 --> 33:27.203
As a matter of fact, I
don't need your permission

33:27.267 --> 33:29.003
because I've already seen her.

33:29.068 --> 33:30.771
I've had a
conversation with her.

33:30.837 --> 33:35.076
I just failed to mention
that I was her real mother.

33:44.913 --> 33:47.549
This is my fault.

33:47.616 --> 33:49.552
I meant to tell you.

33:49.617 --> 33:52.054
I was trying to tell
you last night.

33:52.687 --> 33:56.426
Are you telling me that
what she said is true?

33:57.089 --> 34:01.262
That this woman is my...

34:01.759 --> 34:03.295
Your mother.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.969
How long have you known?

34:14.869 --> 34:16.705
What were you doing?

34:20.507 --> 34:24.614
Were you all just going to keep
this little secret from me forever?

34:30.614 --> 34:32.117
For my own good?

34:32.181 --> 34:33.885
No, Carol.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.520
Maybe it was a mistake.

34:37.585 --> 34:39.422
Yes, it was!

34:39.654 --> 34:42.993
It was a very big one.
A very big one!

34:43.924 --> 34:45.359
Carol.

34:45.426 --> 34:48.264
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

34:48.827 --> 34:51.297
I need some time to myself.

34:51.664 --> 34:54.000
And just leave me alone.

35:07.807 --> 35:10.311
I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.

35:10.376 --> 35:13.180
I had a hard and fast rule
about missing persons cases.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.079
I never took them.

35:15.346 --> 35:18.285
Unless there was
a very good reason.

35:18.349 --> 35:21.587
Like, the missing
person was my friend.

35:21.651 --> 35:25.190
And she'd already told me where
she went to think things out.

35:50.305 --> 35:53.443
I'm not talking to you.
I'm mad at you.

35:53.508 --> 35:56.346
And you, you of all people.
You should know

35:56.410 --> 35:57.746
that you cannot protect
me from the truth!

35:57.812 --> 36:01.017
That is just the worst
thing you can do to me.

36:01.714 --> 36:03.818
I thought about that, Carol.

36:05.383 --> 36:07.385
I thought about it a lot.

36:08.986 --> 36:11.925
There just wasn't really
anything I could do.

36:11.989 --> 36:14.193
Abigail wanted
to tell you herself.

36:14.256 --> 36:17.495
She's had 30 some
years to bring it up.

36:17.559 --> 36:21.465
If she really wanted to, you would've
thought that she could've found some way.

36:21.529 --> 36:23.431
If she really wanted to.

36:24.799 --> 36:27.670
I think she did something pretty
spectacular 30 years ago.

36:27.734 --> 36:31.440
I cannot believe that this is
happening tonight, of all nights.

36:31.503 --> 36:33.840
Do you know that I have closing
arguments in the morning?

36:33.939 --> 36:35.106
Tomorrow.

36:36.107 --> 36:37.976
I'm just so mad at her.

36:39.109 --> 36:41.813
Well, I don't think you're
really mad at Abigail.

36:41.877 --> 36:44.749
Please don't bother to
tell me who I am mad at.

36:44.813 --> 36:47.150
I can figure that
out myself just fine.

36:47.214 --> 36:49.618
I think you're
mad at your father.

36:50.818 --> 36:54.624
That is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard you say.

36:55.587 --> 36:57.991
That is just so stupid.

36:58.790 --> 37:01.160
That's what's really
upsetting you, isn't it?

37:01.224 --> 37:02.225
No!

37:02.760 --> 37:04.329
What your father did.

37:04.394 --> 37:05.562
No!

37:05.628 --> 37:09.468
He didn't know it,
he was... He loved me!

37:09.965 --> 37:11.867
I didn't say he didn't.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.838
Then why did he lie to me?

37:17.737 --> 37:19.506
You don't lie
to people that you love.

37:19.572 --> 37:21.474
Why, why didn't
he trust me enough

37:21.540 --> 37:24.278
to tell me who I really am?

37:24.642 --> 37:26.177
I think he did.

37:29.779 --> 37:32.918
He just couldn't
tell you about Brenda.

37:34.516 --> 37:36.553
But she was my mother.

37:40.254 --> 37:41.789
Oh, Thomas.

37:46.091 --> 37:49.230
L... l wish you would
have known him.

37:49.294 --> 37:53.833
He was a strong man, he was
kind and he was funny.

37:53.898 --> 37:56.202
He was very funny.

37:56.266 --> 37:58.569
And I thought he was perfect.

37:59.468 --> 38:00.970
And he wasn't.

38:04.238 --> 38:07.676
And he's not even around
anymore for me to get mad at.

38:12.645 --> 38:15.549
Do you think I'll ever be
able to love him again?

38:18.149 --> 38:20.151
I think you do right now.

38:32.225 --> 38:35.531
I'm speaking to you from the Honolulu
Courthouse which erupted in pandemonium

38:35.595 --> 38:38.599
just minutes ago, when Honolulu
businessman Forrest Bingham

38:38.664 --> 38:42.369
was found guilty as charged of
first-degree murder. The verdict...

38:42.433 --> 38:45.604
Of course we're very pleased.
Very gratified.

38:45.669 --> 38:48.907
Carol Baldwin and I have been working
on this prosecution for months,

38:48.971 --> 38:50.941
and to tell you
the truth, early on...

39:04.150 --> 39:08.223
Miss Babcock, I had a
feeling you might show up.

39:08.286 --> 39:10.923
Yeah.

39:10.988 --> 39:14.393
Well, I had to see
my girl win, didn't I?

39:16.392 --> 39:20.732
Besides, I think I deserve a shot at
telling her my side of the story.

39:22.196 --> 39:24.967
Please, take this.

39:25.032 --> 39:26.734
It's a check.

39:27.500 --> 39:31.808
I hope it'll persuade you to leave
this island and never come back.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.941
Why are you doing this?

39:35.439 --> 39:39.813
You took money before.
Why won't you take it again?

39:42.377 --> 39:44.814
You say you love Carol.

39:45.279 --> 39:48.183
The best way to demonstrate
that would be to leave,

39:50.050 --> 39:53.490
I'm hoping that
when you leave, I...

39:53.686 --> 39:57.325
That I'll be able to
reconnect with Carol

39:58.423 --> 40:02.263
and build a new relationship
with my daughter.

40:05.996 --> 40:07.531
Your daughter?

40:39.187 --> 40:40.489
Hi.

40:43.956 --> 40:44.958
Hi.

40:47.294 --> 40:50.231
You know, I've always wondered
how come I like to sing.

40:51.029 --> 40:52.799
I do. I'm not very good at it.

40:52.864 --> 40:55.534
But I like to sing in the
shower and in the car

40:55.598 --> 40:58.236
and nobody else
in my family sings.

40:59.135 --> 41:01.004
Yeah, well.

41:01.470 --> 41:02.470
Well.

41:05.007 --> 41:08.212
You know, I'm not quite
sure where we go from here.

41:09.375 --> 41:12.814
But I was thinking, I guess
maybe you and I should try

41:12.878 --> 41:15.449
to get to know one another.
What do you think?

41:17.382 --> 41:19.218
I think...

41:21.252 --> 41:23.455
That's a real good idea.

41:25.487 --> 41:28.826
The trouble is,
I'm... I'm leaving.

41:28.890 --> 41:30.058
You're leaving? Yeah.

41:30.125 --> 41:32.929
But you just got here. I
mean, I've just met you.

41:32.993 --> 41:36.264
Yeah, I know. My timing,
as usual, is the pits.

41:37.263 --> 41:41.570
But you see, I've got this
terrific gig in Atlantic City.

41:41.632 --> 41:45.338
And there's this guy.

41:46.203 --> 41:49.074
And you know that old
saying, "Absence makes"

41:49.139 --> 41:51.810
"the heart grow fonder,
for somebody else."

41:55.810 --> 41:58.046
Look, kid.

41:59.313 --> 42:00.782
The truth is,

42:02.282 --> 42:05.921
I just don't think that I'm
cut out to be somebody's mom.

42:08.354 --> 42:10.657
And frankly, I don't much like

42:10.721 --> 42:14.259
the idea of people knowing I got
me a kid as old as you are.

42:14.424 --> 42:17.829
So, it was nice meeting you.

42:18.060 --> 42:20.397
Yeah, and

42:21.429 --> 42:22.764
this is goodbye.

42:22.830 --> 42:24.165
Wait a minute.

42:24.231 --> 42:25.901
Wait a minute.

42:26.432 --> 42:28.402
Didn't you think about that?
You must have,

42:28.467 --> 42:31.472
you must have thought about it
before you decided to come.

42:33.072 --> 42:34.574
No.

42:37.441 --> 42:39.812
No, I didn't.

43:40.621 --> 43:42.523
Thomas.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.796
Come with me. What're you doing?

43:48.861 --> 43:50.029
I'm not gonna go with you.

43:50.095 --> 43:51.530
Oh, yes, you are.

43:55.599 --> 43:56.834
Abigail!

43:59.136 --> 44:00.270
Abigail!

44:00.336 --> 44:01.805
Yes.

44:02.871 --> 44:05.408
Okay, talk!

44:06.607 --> 44:09.678
Thomas, I do appreciate
what you're trying to do.

44:09.742 --> 44:11.211
I don't have anything to say.

44:11.277 --> 44:12.445
Yes, you do.

44:12.511 --> 44:14.548
Both of you!

44:14.613 --> 44:16.615
Carol, you wanna say
that you're mad as hell

44:16.680 --> 44:19.718
because nobody ever
told you the truth. Right?

44:20.517 --> 44:21.719
Yeah. I guess that's right.

44:21.785 --> 44:24.824
And Abigail, you wanna say even a natural
mother could never have loved a daughter

44:24.888 --> 44:27.224
the way that you
loved Carol. Right?

44:27.289 --> 44:28.824
Of course.

44:28.890 --> 44:30.592
Okay.

44:32.026 --> 44:34.229
So, maybe, Carol,

44:34.294 --> 44:37.900
you're just going to have to
accept the fact that Abigail

44:38.230 --> 44:40.300
and your dad

44:40.432 --> 44:42.569
did the very best they could.

44:46.137 --> 44:49.408
And that in every way
that means anything,

44:50.539 --> 44:52.676
you ale Abigail's daughter.

44:59.746 --> 45:01.348
I love you, Mom.

45:14.090 --> 45:15.892
Let's go, driver.

45:28.367 --> 45:31.072
Oh, dear, I'm leaking
all over your suit.

45:32.438 --> 45:34.541
Oh, Mother, would
you please stop?

45:35.539 --> 45:38.710
Now, listen, how about this? How
about if I take you two to lunch?

45:38.775 --> 45:40.845
And we'll celebrate
the Baldwin victory.

45:40.910 --> 45:43.347
Great. How about
Benny's Fish Emporium?

45:43.413 --> 45:45.282
Oh, no. Not Benny's.

45:45.347 --> 45:48.251
The health department
cited him for cockroaches.

45:48.316 --> 45:50.219
Oh, Mother. That
was six years ago.

45:50.284 --> 45:51.284
Well, still.

45:51.351 --> 45:53.722
What? The food is very
good there. I don't...

45:53.786 --> 45:55.823
Oh, please, forget it.
Where do you wanna go?

45:55.888 --> 45:58.192
Whatever you say. Hold it.

45:58.257 --> 46:01.128
It's Benny's Fish Emporium.
And it's on me.

46:02.860 --> 46:06.165
Thank you for the rescue. I don't
know why we keep doing this.

46:06.562 --> 46:08.164
Neither do I.
