You see the tracks?

03:03.948 --> 03:05.849
BEN: They're not in a

03:05.916 --> 03:07.518
They're all a mess.

03:07.585 --> 03:08.953
Not a mess.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.089
Look careful at each set.

03:12.156 --> 03:14.724
Direction, intensity.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.593
All together, they tell a story.

03:16.661 --> 03:18.429
Hey, I need to rest.

03:18.495 --> 03:19.630
CATO: There ain't no resting.

03:19.697 --> 03:20.997
There's running
and there's being caught.

03:21.065 --> 03:22.699
Now get your ass up, old man.

03:22.765 --> 03:23.901
Let me carry her a while.

03:23.967 --> 03:25.235
Don't touch her!

03:26.237 --> 03:29.006
You said there was a plan. A map.

03:29.073 --> 03:30.742

MOSES: Then you just gonna leave us.

03:32.043 --> 03:33.378

03:40.551 --> 03:41.985
The five who used the fire
as a distraction

03:42.053 --> 03:43.788
must have met up
with the two who ran earlier.

03:43.854 --> 03:45.822
Is seven runaways a lot?

03:45.889 --> 03:47.824
More than I've ever seen.

03:47.892 --> 03:49.561
And they're all working together?

03:50.728 --> 03:52.930
Up to here, anyhow.

03:52.996 --> 03:56.299
See the skids, broken branches?

03:56.366 --> 03:57.567
There was a fight.

03:57.634 --> 03:59.402
Now, we all sorry
what done happen Pearly Mae...

03:59.470 --> 04:00.871
Ain't got no use for your sympathy!

04:00.937 --> 04:02.072
I trusted you.

04:02.139 --> 04:03.573
Now my family's torn apart.

04:03.639 --> 04:06.009
- Let go of him!
- They got my Pearly Mae. They got her!

04:06.077 --> 04:07.345

Stop it! You scaring Boo.

04:12.650 --> 04:14.285
I'm sorry, sorry.

04:14.352 --> 04:16.887
Noah, that slave catcher and
his son could be on our tails.

04:16.954 --> 04:18.622
We too exposed in this daylight.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.992
We have to find some place
to hide, wait till nightfall.

04:21.057 --> 04:23.593
So we can continue star gazing?

04:23.661 --> 04:25.196
Find ourselves the blue haze?

04:25.262 --> 04:27.029
Ain't none of us got any idea
what the hell any of that means.

04:27.096 --> 04:29.432
You got any better ideas on how to
run other than running, we all ears.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.069
Well, I'm glad you finally asked.

04:32.135 --> 04:33.437
Tell me what you see here.

04:36.774 --> 04:38.122
I ain't sure, sir.

04:38.188 --> 04:39.877
Changed course.

04:39.944 --> 04:42.380
They ain't just running
to escape no more,

04:42.447 --> 04:44.115
they running to something.

04:44.180 --> 04:45.848
- What's east?
- CATO: <i>A train.</i>

04:45.916 --> 04:47.517
Northbound. Out of Atlanta.

04:47.584 --> 04:49.433
Ain't no way in hell you could
know something like that.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.355
Her momma the one told me.
Said it'd be leaving today.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.523
Look, I don't know what your angle
is, but we sticking to the plan.

04:53.591 --> 04:56.461
- Oh, so now we "sticking to the plan?"
- NOAH: Hey!

04:56.528 --> 04:58.529
We ain't on the plantation no more.

04:58.596 --> 04:59.997
You ain't driving nothing round here.

05:00.062 --> 05:01.899
I'm the one who got the lion's
share of us off Macon.

05:04.868 --> 05:07.103
I'm going for that train.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.873
Ain't like we can just walk
into the city and buy tickets.

05:09.940 --> 05:12.009
I might be I know
somebody who could help.

05:13.478 --> 05:14.545
(EXHALES)

05:24.191 --> 05:25.625
Let's get a move on.

05:25.777 --> 05:26.979
We ain't that far behind.

05:54.325 --> 05:56.227
Now, this is a surprise.

05:56.292 --> 05:59.062
I had no idea you knew
where this nursery was.

05:59.128 --> 06:00.131
Give us the room.

06:01.698 --> 06:02.833
Now.

06:06.737 --> 06:08.006
(SIGHS)

06:08.172 --> 06:10.643
You've got all the slaves
out in that ruined field,

06:10.794 --> 06:13.397
I barely have any help
in this house as it is,

06:13.636 --> 06:15.404
and now you're dismissing them, too.

06:18.181 --> 06:20.551
(SOFTLY) This was
an attack on our family.

06:20.617 --> 06:22.352
Who knows how long
they'd been planning this...

06:22.419 --> 06:23.755
- ... how many were involved.
- Oh, please...

06:23.821 --> 06:25.890
... be more dramatic.

06:25.955 --> 06:28.893
When Daddy was in charge
they'd run off all the time

06:28.960 --> 06:30.762
and be dragged right back.

06:30.828 --> 06:33.429
It's just a facet of Southern life.

06:33.825 --> 06:34.999
These things happen.

06:35.064 --> 06:36.380
Not to me.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.536
This whole mess could not have come
at a worse time for my campaign,

06:39.604 --> 06:41.614
especially with the
reverend arriving soon.

06:42.273 --> 06:45.008
Now, I put a substantial reward
on those runners' heads,

06:45.075 --> 06:47.311
but there's not much more
I can do from here.

06:47.378 --> 06:49.180
Pearly Mae knows
where those runners went.

06:49.246 --> 06:51.215
She could help us catch 'em
sooner rather than later.

06:51.282 --> 06:53.417
So sick the paddy rollers on her.

06:53.484 --> 06:54.486
I have.

06:55.453 --> 06:57.088
She hasn't uttered a word.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.190
Now, I plan to talk to every
slave on this plantation,

06:59.256 --> 07:01.391
but Pearly Mae is the key.

07:03.361 --> 07:05.729
(SIGHS)

07:05.796 --> 07:08.600
Now, you share certain things
in common with her.

07:09.934 --> 07:11.314
You're both mothers.

07:11.936 --> 07:13.705
You're both born on this plantation.

07:14.972 --> 07:16.039
And...

07:17.140 --> 07:19.242
and I... (SIGHS)

07:19.309 --> 07:21.042
I would appreciate...

07:21.778 --> 07:25.449
... any insight you have
on how to get her to crack.

07:47.356 --> 07:48.726
I ain't seen any moving around inside.

07:48.949 --> 07:50.407
You sure this his place?

07:50.475 --> 07:52.309
Well, I ain't been here
since I was sold to Macon.

07:52.376 --> 07:53.544
Could be he gone.

07:53.611 --> 07:55.204
You okay?

07:55.847 --> 07:57.648
It ain't your fault,
what happened to Pearly Mae.

07:57.715 --> 08:00.251
We got to get on that train,
for Boo's sake.

08:01.652 --> 08:02.652
We going in.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.554
Moses, Cato, you're with me.

08:04.621 --> 08:05.756
I ain't taking Boo in there.

08:05.823 --> 08:07.024
You most certainly ain't.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.391
You the one know the man the best.

08:08.458 --> 08:09.793
He might not help less you with us.

08:09.861 --> 08:11.829
I ain't leaving my baby behind.

08:11.895 --> 08:13.698
You want to help her? This is how.

08:13.763 --> 08:14.997
I got her.

08:15.064 --> 08:16.400
Henry, Zeke with me,

08:16.467 --> 08:18.536
case anything happen,
anyways. Come on, baby.

08:19.837 --> 08:21.072
Come on.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.995
We don't mean you no harm.

08:44.062 --> 08:45.296
I knew I should have stayed away

08:45.362 --> 08:47.131
when you come at me for paper.

08:47.197 --> 08:48.799
You want us gone? You tell us how we

08:48.866 --> 08:50.467
get on that train leaving Atlanta today.

08:50.534 --> 08:52.102
Hey, now, that's tricky stuff.

08:52.169 --> 08:54.137
No, it got to be a way that don't
involve sneaking in the city.

08:54.204 --> 08:55.705
MOSES: You used to be a railroad man.

08:55.772 --> 08:57.607
If anybody know, figure it's you.

08:57.674 --> 09:01.245
Well, maybe I can help,
but everything got a price.

09:01.312 --> 09:03.347
We ain't got nothing
to trade but your hide.

09:03.414 --> 09:05.082
Now, that ain't at all true.

09:05.147 --> 09:06.383
We got a old revolver.

09:06.451 --> 09:07.585
From a collector.

09:07.651 --> 09:09.152
I helped procure it myself.

09:09.219 --> 09:10.620
- What kind of revolver?
- It ain't for trade.

09:10.688 --> 09:12.021
Everything's for trade.

09:12.088 --> 09:14.725
Oh, well, maybe I use it once,
before I give it up then.

09:16.961 --> 09:18.096
(GRUNTS)

09:19.496 --> 09:21.198
Now, we give you this here,

09:21.265 --> 09:22.634
you get us on that train.

09:41.385 --> 09:42.687
(CLANKING)

09:54.164 --> 09:56.467
Someone ought to take her some water.

09:56.534 --> 09:58.535
She don't deserve a drop of nothing.

09:58.602 --> 10:01.838
Life gonna be harder for all of
us 'cause of that woman and hers.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.607
I hear the rollers
working over the lot of us.

10:05.108 --> 10:06.944

10:11.915 --> 10:13.684
Seem like life gonna
change for all of us.

10:13.751 --> 10:15.653
Still, that woman there lost her child.

10:15.718 --> 10:17.088
She deserves some mercy.

10:19.589 --> 10:21.425
Don't be stupid, now.

Watch yourself, boy.

she hits the switch

11:15.371 --> 11:16.439
just outside of town.

11:16.506 --> 11:18.241
Now, that's when she slows down,

11:18.307 --> 11:20.809
exposing her ass
like a two-dollar hooker.

11:20.877 --> 11:23.212
So that's how you get all this
junk, stealing from the trains.

11:23.278 --> 11:25.080
This is good, okay?

11:25.147 --> 11:27.316
It's still think in the woods.
We have enough cover to slip on.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.785
Timing's tough.

11:28.852 --> 11:30.387
That's where I lost my leg.

It'll send 'em coming

29:03.130 --> 29:05.364
A sweet drink for the lady.

29:06.598 --> 29:09.134
Then he'd sit and look you in the eye,

29:09.201 --> 29:10.737

29:10.804 --> 29:12.305
