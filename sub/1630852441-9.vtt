00:14.791 --> 00:15.708
Come on!

00:16.208 --> 00:20.375
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.458 --> 00:23.916
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:24.833
All right!

00:24.916 --> 00:27.041
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:29.291
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:30.625
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.708 --> 00:32.083
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.416
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:36.333
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.416 --> 00:37.750
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.833 --> 00:39.833
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:39.916 --> 00:45.208
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.291 --> 00:47.166
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:54.708 --> 00:56.375
Wiggle.

00:56.458 --> 01:01.375
<i>The babies are playing a game</i>
<i>of Lulu Says.</i>

01:01.458 --> 01:04.458
Lulu says… stop wiggling!

01:06.000 --> 01:08.208
Lulu says…

01:08.875 --> 01:10.166
now clap.

01:14.583 --> 01:17.041
Lulu says…

01:17.708 --> 01:23.000
walk three steps that way!

01:24.708 --> 01:28.250
-Okay. One, two, three.
-Wrong way!

01:28.333 --> 01:32.208
Wrong way! Lulu wins!

01:34.208 --> 01:36.166
Did she say which way to go?

01:37.333 --> 01:40.875
Lulu, you didn't give good directions.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.750
"Directions"?

01:44.250 --> 01:49.541
<i>Babies, directions help you</i>
<i>tell someone where and how far to go.</i>

01:49.625 --> 01:51.666
But that's what Lulu said.

01:52.583 --> 01:55.916
"That way! Three steps."

01:56.000 --> 01:58.250
See? Lulu wins.

01:59.333 --> 02:03.416
Tilly, you only had to take three steps.
You can stop walking.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.916
-Tilly?
-I think Tilly needs help counting.

02:09.291 --> 02:12.458
-We should sing the counting song!
-Yeah!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.166
<i>One, two, three</i>

02:18.250 --> 02:19.416
<i>Four, five, six</i>

02:20.208 --> 02:23.041
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

02:23.125 --> 02:24.291
<i>Let's do it again!</i>

02:24.375 --> 02:26.458
<i>-One, two, three</i>
<i>-One, two, three</i>

02:26.541 --> 02:28.458
<i>-Four, five, six</i>
<i>-Four, five, six</i>

02:28.541 --> 02:31.208
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

02:32.375 --> 02:36.208
<i>Can we please count noodles?</i>
<i>One, two, three</i>

02:36.291 --> 02:40.500
<i>Let's count hats</i>
<i>There's one, two, three, four I see</i>

02:41.083 --> 02:42.958
<i>One dog, two ducks</i>

02:43.041 --> 02:45.000
<i>Three cars, four trucks</i>

02:45.083 --> 02:49.083
<i>When it's time to go to sleep</i>
<i>We can count sheep</i>

02:49.166 --> 02:50.333
<i>One, two, three</i>

02:51.333 --> 02:52.500
<i>Four, five, six</i>

02:53.375 --> 02:56.041
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

02:57.250 --> 02:59.625
<i>Let's count to ten from beginning to end</i>

02:59.708 --> 03:03.291
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six</i>
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

03:06.625 --> 03:09.541
<i>Yī, èr, sān.</i>

03:11.208 --> 03:16.375
"One, two, three."
Three steps. Good job, Tilly.

03:18.166 --> 03:22.541
Well, it's playtime now.
Do you want to read a Snaily Book?

03:26.041 --> 03:30.083
Well, do you want to play a board game
with Kip and Franny?

03:33.708 --> 03:36.208
No. Not there.

03:36.708 --> 03:38.083
Over here.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.833
Do you want to play with Lulu?

03:45.583 --> 03:49.041
Watch out for the noodle river! Oh no!

03:49.125 --> 03:50.791
Go!

03:51.958 --> 03:55.875
Spaghetti snakes! Go!

03:58.250 --> 04:02.750
I did it! I'm the Noodle Master!

04:07.333 --> 04:09.041
What are you playing, Lulu?

04:09.958 --> 04:13.625
It's a video game called <i>Noodle Master</i>.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.333
Well, could Tilly have a turn?

04:19.375 --> 04:20.208
No.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.250
Because Tilly doesn't know how to play.

04:25.875 --> 04:29.708
Well, but, you're so good at it.
You could teach her.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.666
Oh yes! And then maybe
you could be Noodle Master!

04:36.416 --> 04:37.250
Maybe.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.833
Lulu knows the best way to play.

04:45.458 --> 04:50.000
You pretend you're <i>in</i> the game.
Want to do that, Tilly?

04:50.625 --> 04:51.458
<i>Shì.</i>

04:52.541 --> 04:58.583
Okay. Let's use our imagination.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.083
<i>N ho.</i>

05:05.166 --> 05:10.708
Tilly, are you ready to try
to become a Noodle Master?

05:10.791 --> 05:12.208
<i>Shì!</i>

05:13.083 --> 05:15.083
I'll tell you where to go.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.333
Ready, Tilly?

05:17.500 --> 05:19.333
Just go over there.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Over there.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.041
That way. No. No, that way.

05:26.125 --> 05:30.875
Oh no! You're going to hit
the Leaning Tower of Pasta!

05:37.291 --> 05:39.166
Let's try again.

05:39.666 --> 05:43.208
Tilly, you have to go on the right path.

05:43.916 --> 05:46.416
There. Right there.

05:48.208 --> 05:51.666
No, you can't… No, right there.
No, you can't-- No--

05:55.791 --> 05:56.875
Okay.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.500
No, you can't go over--

06:00.583 --> 06:02.250
What-- No, not there.

06:02.333 --> 06:07.208
Where are you going? Tilly, don't--

06:07.291 --> 06:10.666
What are you doing? That's not right.

06:11.250 --> 06:14.958
Tilly, that's wrong!
You have to go that way.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.166
No, that-- What are--

06:17.250 --> 06:19.041
What is happening? Tilly!

06:19.125 --> 06:19.958
Oh okay.

06:21.291 --> 06:23.250
No. No, that's not right.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.291
No.

06:25.375 --> 06:27.333
No, Tilly, no.

06:27.416 --> 06:31.000
Oh careful, you're going to wake
the Macaroni Monsters!

06:32.875 --> 06:34.875
You're not doing it right.

06:37.458 --> 06:40.250
Tilly, you can't play my game any more!

06:41.750 --> 06:43.708
You have to give it back!

06:43.791 --> 06:45.291
Well, what's wrong?

06:45.375 --> 06:47.791
Tilly doesn't go where I say.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.916
She keeps going that way and not this way.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.916
Maybe you need to give better directions.

06:55.708 --> 06:58.125
-"Directions"?
-Yeah.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.041
I don't know how to do that.

07:02.125 --> 07:07.125
Well, you have to tell Tilly
which way to go and how many squares.

07:07.208 --> 07:12.041
Did you say "how many"?
Maybe this is a maths problem!

07:12.125 --> 07:13.583
We need…

07:13.666 --> 07:16.291
Maths Molly!

07:18.791 --> 07:20.250
There she goes!

07:20.333 --> 07:23.666
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:23.750 --> 07:25.291
We need help!

07:25.375 --> 07:29.541
Tilly really wants
to be a Noodle Master like me.

07:32.583 --> 07:37.041
First, Tilly has to go there.
Which way is that?

07:40.791 --> 07:42.958
<i>Down one square.</i>

07:45.791 --> 07:50.833
Now, Tilly has to go that way.
How do I say that?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.916
<i>To the side two squares.</i>

08:00.500 --> 08:04.375
That's the last direction.
Where does Tilly go now?

08:07.375 --> 08:09.750
<i>Up three squares.</i>

08:10.458 --> 08:13.625
So, those are the directions.

08:13.708 --> 08:18.166
Down, to the side, and then up.

08:18.250 --> 08:22.250
And a different number
of squares every time.

08:22.333 --> 08:26.083
-So Tilly can win!
-Yeah!

08:26.166 --> 08:29.000
But first, a…

08:29.875 --> 08:32.500
Maths Party!

08:32.583 --> 08:33.875
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:33.958 --> 08:35.375
<i>We did math</i>s

08:35.458 --> 08:37.541
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

08:38.458 --> 08:41.375
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

08:41.458 --> 08:44.833
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

08:44.916 --> 08:45.750
Yeah!

08:45.833 --> 08:47.458
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

08:47.541 --> 08:48.875
<i>We did maths</i>

08:48.958 --> 08:51.375
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

08:51.875 --> 08:54.541
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

08:54.625 --> 08:59.375
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

08:59.458 --> 09:02.000
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:02.583 --> 09:05.125
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:10.000 --> 09:11.458
Ready, Player Tilly?

09:13.458 --> 09:16.333
Go down one square.

09:20.666 --> 09:21.875
<i>Yī.</i>

09:23.500 --> 09:28.458
Okay. Go to the side two squares.

09:30.666 --> 09:32.875
<i>Yī, èr.</i>

09:32.958 --> 09:35.041
You're almost there!

09:35.916 --> 09:39.708
Now, go up three squares.

09:47.875 --> 09:51.375
<i>Yī, èr, sān.</i>

10:04.375 --> 10:07.500
You did it! You won the game!

10:10.500 --> 10:13.083
Yay, Tilly!

10:13.166 --> 10:15.708
Tilly the Noodle Master!

10:16.458 --> 10:20.916
And don't forget Lulu,
a Noodle Master Master!

10:23.458 --> 10:27.000
-You gave great directions.
-Thanks.

10:34.833 --> 10:38.208
I think Tilly wants
to give us directions now.

10:38.291 --> 10:39.333
Yeah.

10:39.416 --> 10:42.541
She wants to do the pattern dance.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.541
Let's go!

10:46.625 --> 10:48.708
<i>Let's do Tilly's pattern dance</i>

10:48.791 --> 10:51.083
<i>-It's such a fun dance to do</i>
-Yeah!

10:51.166 --> 10:53.083
<i>We'll follow Tilly's pattern</i>

10:53.166 --> 10:55.250
<i>You can do it too</i>

10:55.333 --> 10:56.916
And it goes like this!

10:57.416 --> 10:59.583
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

10:59.666 --> 11:02.041
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:02.125 --> 11:04.083
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

11:04.166 --> 11:06.541
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:06.625 --> 11:08.916
<i>Can we change it a little?</i>
<i>Put a hop in the middle?</i>

11:09.000 --> 11:10.916
<i>Spin around and pretend to climb?</i>

11:11.000 --> 11:13.625
<i>But that's not Tilly's pattern</i>

11:13.708 --> 11:17.666
<i>A pattern does the same thing every time</i>

11:18.333 --> 11:19.833
Here we go!

11:19.916 --> 11:22.250
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

11:22.333 --> 11:24.708
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:24.791 --> 11:26.916
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

11:27.000 --> 11:29.791
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

11:29.875 --> 11:32.000
<i>That's Tilly's pattern</i>

11:32.500 --> 11:37.458
Jump once. Clap twice.
Stomp one, two, three.

11:38.541 --> 11:42.583
Thank you for helping us
so that we could both be…

11:47.416 --> 11:49.750
Noodle Masters!

11:49.833 --> 11:51.416
<i>Zài jiàn!</i>

11:51.500 --> 11:53.166
-Jump once.
-Okay.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.416
<i>The babies are playing</i>
<i>in the playroom today.</i>

12:09.958 --> 12:12.791
Any sign of the outlaw?

12:13.291 --> 12:16.666
Howdy, Sheriff. Who y'all lookin' for?

12:16.750 --> 12:18.916
Tilly the Kid.

12:20.583 --> 12:25.125
She's wanted for eating too many crackers.

12:25.208 --> 12:28.916
And that could cause
the greatest crime of all.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.666
A tummy ache.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.458
Too bad you'll never find her.

12:34.541 --> 12:37.125
The Cookie Crumble Kid!

12:39.916 --> 12:46.166
That's right, Sheriff.
You'll never find Tilly the Kid

12:46.250 --> 12:49.875
because I taught her how to hide.

12:53.666 --> 12:57.833
It looks like you also taught her
how to be messy.

12:59.625 --> 13:03.250
Cracker crumbs!
So, where do they lead, Sheriff?

13:03.333 --> 13:06.208
This trail leads to the playground!

13:06.291 --> 13:09.458
Let's take the bubble train
and get there fast!

13:09.541 --> 13:10.500
Oh yeah!

13:10.583 --> 13:12.375
Good idea, Deputy.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.833
Yeehaw!

13:16.916 --> 13:18.541
I mean, let's go.

13:21.708 --> 13:23.416
-Yeah! Let's go!
-Come on!

13:24.958 --> 13:27.208
<i>-Woo-hoo!</i>
<i>-It's time for a ride</i>

13:27.291 --> 13:28.833
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

13:28.916 --> 13:30.208
<i>Feeling happy inside</i>

13:30.291 --> 13:31.375
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

13:31.458 --> 13:33.083
<i>We're moving on</i>

13:33.166 --> 13:35.541
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

13:35.625 --> 13:36.791
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

13:36.875 --> 13:38.208
<i>Places to go</i>

13:38.291 --> 13:39.625
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

13:39.708 --> 13:41.000
<i>-Go fast</i>
<i>-Or slow</i>

13:41.083 --> 13:42.208
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

13:42.291 --> 13:43.666
<i>We're moving on</i>

13:43.750 --> 13:46.416
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

13:46.500 --> 13:49.041
<i>It's great to travel in time and space</i>

13:49.125 --> 13:50.333
<i>Bopping and singing</i>

13:50.416 --> 13:51.541
<i>From place to place</i>

13:51.625 --> 13:52.833
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

13:52.916 --> 13:54.458
<i>We're moving on</i>

13:54.541 --> 13:56.833
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

13:56.916 --> 13:58.125
<i>I'm up front</i>

13:58.208 --> 13:59.500
<i>Me, caboose</i>

13:59.583 --> 14:02.208
<i>-Let's pop the bubbles</i>
<i>-The bubbles are loose</i>

14:02.291 --> 14:03.333
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:03.416 --> 14:05.041
<i>We're moving on</i>

14:05.125 --> 14:07.791
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

14:07.875 --> 14:10.541
<i>Sing with the bubbles</i>
<i>It's a bubble train song</i>

14:10.625 --> 14:12.500
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

14:16.041 --> 14:21.458
The trail of crumbs.
And they go right past the steps. Come on!

14:21.541 --> 14:24.125
-Coming, Sheriff.
-Wait for me, Sheriff.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.125
Gotcha, Tilly the Kid!

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
<i>N ho.</i>

14:34.416 --> 14:37.333
-Sheriff Franny saved the day!
-Yay!

14:37.416 --> 14:40.333
-Aw shucks. Just doing my job.
-Yay!

14:40.416 --> 14:44.083
Keeping our town safe and quiet.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.833
The What's It Toy!

14:46.333 --> 14:51.083
Don't worry, Sheriff.
I'll rustle him up for ya. Yeehaw!

14:53.166 --> 14:54.333
Go, What's It!

15:20.041 --> 15:23.291
All right. Open up there, What's It.

15:23.375 --> 15:26.875
The What's It Toy always has
what you need when you need it.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.041
-Thanks, What's It Toy!
-Thanks, What's It!

15:31.125 --> 15:33.250
-Bye.
-What is it?

15:33.333 --> 15:34.458
It's a…

15:36.291 --> 15:38.000
-Wow!
-…map!

15:38.500 --> 15:40.791
To treasure.

15:41.708 --> 15:45.083
Treasure? Well, I'll bet it's…

15:45.750 --> 15:48.708
gold! It's gold, I tell ya! It's gold!

15:48.791 --> 15:50.416
I want it! I need it!

15:50.500 --> 15:53.125
Somebody find me that sweet, sweet gold!

15:55.208 --> 15:57.625
I like gold. It's shiny.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.458
-Well, then, let's find that treasure!
-Yeah!

16:04.041 --> 16:08.041
Wait a second.
Do any of us know how to read a map?

16:08.125 --> 16:10.125
Well, I mean,

16:10.208 --> 16:11.041
of course…

16:11.750 --> 16:12.583
No.

16:12.666 --> 16:17.375
Well, maybe we follow these dots
like we followed the crumbs.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.541
Yeah!

16:18.625 --> 16:21.833
I think those dots show us where to go.

16:21.916 --> 16:27.625
Maybe less dots means we're close,
and more dots means…

16:27.708 --> 16:30.166
We're far.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.916
Well, less and more is maths, right?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.250
I think I know someone
who can help us read this map.

16:37.291 --> 16:40.666
Maths Molly!

16:47.916 --> 16:51.875
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

16:52.375 --> 16:54.750
Help us find the gold!

16:56.208 --> 16:59.708
That's our map. We start over there.

17:00.208 --> 17:03.041
And then we follow the dots to here.

17:03.541 --> 17:05.333
That's a mountain.

17:05.416 --> 17:08.541
Big kids, here we have to go…

17:13.083 --> 17:14.791
<i>Over.</i>

17:14.875 --> 17:18.541
Over the mountain.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.541
That's a bridge.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.958
So, big kids, here we should go…

17:31.500 --> 17:32.958
<i>Under.</i>

17:33.041 --> 17:36.083
Under the bridge. That makes sense.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.000
Yeah.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.250
That's a pond.

17:41.583 --> 17:45.166
So, big kids, here we should go…

17:51.583 --> 17:53.333
<i>Around.</i>

17:53.416 --> 17:57.875
Yep. Around the pond. We can do that.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.875
Those are two trees.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.375
So, big kids, here we should go…

18:12.125 --> 18:13.833
<i>Between.</i>

18:14.500 --> 18:18.750
Between two trees. I've got it!

18:19.541 --> 18:25.208
Now we're ready to follow this map
and find the gold!

18:25.708 --> 18:27.041
We sure will,

18:27.125 --> 18:30.083
but first, let's have a…

18:31.208 --> 18:34.583
Maths Party!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.666
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

18:38.750 --> 18:40.166
<i>We did math</i>s

18:40.250 --> 18:42.333
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

18:43.250 --> 18:46.166
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

18:46.250 --> 18:49.625
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

18:49.708 --> 18:50.541
Yeah!

18:50.625 --> 18:52.250
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

18:52.333 --> 18:53.666
<i>We did maths</i>

18:53.750 --> 18:56.166
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

18:56.666 --> 18:59.333
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

18:59.416 --> 19:04.166
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

19:04.250 --> 19:06.791
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

19:07.375 --> 19:09.875
<i>We love maths!</i>

19:10.500 --> 19:11.875
I really love it.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.791
Okay. Let's follow this map
and find the treasure!

19:17.875 --> 19:18.708
Yay.

19:18.791 --> 19:23.708
We'll find it even faster
if we take the bubble train!

19:24.375 --> 19:28.250
-Yes! Let's use our imaginations.
-Yeah!

19:29.083 --> 19:31.166
All aboard!

19:33.416 --> 19:35.083
Yay. Come on.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.916
<i>First, we go over the mountain.</i>

19:47.375 --> 19:50.500
<i>Then, under the bridge.</i>

19:54.250 --> 19:56.583
<i>And around the pond.</i>

20:02.250 --> 20:04.375
<i>And last stop.</i>

20:09.666 --> 20:13.375
The only direction left is…

20:14.375 --> 20:17.125
between the two trees.

20:19.166 --> 20:22.791
-There it is!
-Oh yeah! All right!

20:22.875 --> 20:25.208
There's a button on the treasure chest!

20:25.958 --> 20:27.583
What should I do?

20:27.666 --> 20:28.958
Push it!

20:29.041 --> 20:30.708
-Yeah!
-Okay!

20:33.666 --> 20:35.750
Wow!

20:35.833 --> 20:37.875
Balloony!

20:37.958 --> 20:39.250
Yay!

20:40.541 --> 20:42.708
Party-in-a-box!

20:44.250 --> 20:47.500
Our treasure is a party!

20:49.750 --> 20:52.958
Cookitybot brought yummy snacks!

20:53.041 --> 20:55.000
Best party ever!

20:56.166 --> 20:57.500
Thanks, Cookitybot.

20:59.208 --> 21:03.250
What's the matter, Bailey?
Don't you like the party?

21:03.333 --> 21:07.583
I do, but I was kind of excited for…

21:08.833 --> 21:09.833
Gold?

21:14.458 --> 21:17.458
Stickety Bot!

21:17.541 --> 21:21.875
<i>Babies, you did a great job</i>
<i>learning how to read a map today,</i>

21:21.958 --> 21:24.000
<i>so you're all getting a sticker.</i>

21:25.083 --> 21:26.125
Yay!

21:28.666 --> 21:29.666
Sticker!

21:32.708 --> 21:36.666
My sticker is… gold!

21:36.750 --> 21:39.875
Gold! Sweet, sweet gold!

21:39.958 --> 21:41.666
Feeling better, Bailey?

21:42.166 --> 21:45.416
Better? I feel so happy I could dance!

21:45.916 --> 21:48.666
A happy dance!

21:51.875 --> 21:55.833
<i>When you want to cheer up</i>
<i>'Cause you feel a little down</i>

21:55.916 --> 21:59.166
<i>It's a whole lot of fun</i>
<i>To start dancing around</i>

21:59.250 --> 22:02.375
<i>Let your feet take you for a real fun ride</i>

22:02.458 --> 22:05.333
<i>Hop a little</i>
<i>Jump a little, go for a slide</i>

22:05.416 --> 22:08.041
<i>And in no time at all</i>

22:08.541 --> 22:11.083
<i>You'll be having a ball</i>

22:11.166 --> 22:14.208
<i>We can dance, dance, dance</i>
<i>To a happy place</i>

22:14.291 --> 22:17.666
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

22:17.750 --> 22:20.333
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

22:20.416 --> 22:22.208
<i>When we're dancing together</i>

22:22.291 --> 22:24.041
<i>We feel a lot better</i>

22:24.125 --> 22:26.041
<i>-Get snappy</i>
<i>-And get clappy</i>

22:27.125 --> 22:30.250
<i>Right away you're gonna feel happy</i>

22:30.333 --> 22:32.958
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

22:33.041 --> 22:36.291
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

22:36.375 --> 22:39.375
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

22:39.458 --> 22:42.250
<i>Dance to a happy place</i>

22:44.708 --> 22:48.208
Thanks, big kids,
for helping us read our map.

22:49.208 --> 22:52.833
And for finding the gold!

22:53.958 --> 22:57.000
We couldn't have done it without ya.

22:57.083 --> 23:00.291
-Bye-bye!
-Bye!
