I eat Krunchies,
Kanine Krunchies.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.580
And you should, too.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.250
Announcer with French accent:
Kanine Krunchies.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.000
Perfect for lunchy.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.880
Designer Kanine Krunchies.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.670
Dare to be a dog.

01:31.670 --> 01:33.380
Bolt:
Shaken, not stirred.

01:33.380 --> 01:36.960
That is just so beautiful.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.750
Yeah, well,
that high-end designer chow

01:39.750 --> 01:41.120
costs big b-b-b-bucks!

01:41.120 --> 01:43.620
And we don't have any,
so get over it.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.080
-Announcer 2:
Hey, hounds,

01:45.080 --> 01:47.380
Monday is designer
Kanine Krunchie day

01:47.380 --> 01:48.880
-at the Stiffle Food Fortress!

01:48.880 --> 01:51.080
Your one and only chance
to try designer KK's

01:51.080 --> 01:52.620
-rocking new flavor...

01:52.620 --> 01:55.000
...pistachio veal,
absolutely free!

01:55.000 --> 01:56.920
I repeat: Free, free, free!

01:56.920 --> 01:58.880
So, come on down and get fed!

01:58.880 --> 02:01.460
-Too cool!
-That's it.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.040
I'm going to Stiffle.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.920
Uh, hello!
Anybody home?

02:05.920 --> 02:08.040
Stiffle is miles away.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.380
In order to cover
that kind of distance,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.170
you would need
transportation.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.830
Yes, yes, of course,
Miss De Vil, I'll get it.

02:17.830 --> 02:22.250
Now listen carefully.
I'm going to spring
a little surprise audit

02:22.250 --> 02:24.880
on that slippery Roger Dearly.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.880
As his chief investor,
I'm convinced that he is
cooking the books.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.830
Until I emerge, you have
one purpose in life:

02:31.830 --> 02:34.000
to watch my car.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.920
Capisce?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.960
Yes, yes,
of course I'm "ca-pish"--
I mean, I'm watching.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.290
You were saying?

02:46.290 --> 02:50.040
Look, even if we wanted
to take Cruella's car
to Stiffle,

02:50.040 --> 02:53.880
which we do not,
how are we supposed
to get past him?

03:00.250 --> 03:01.620
Hmm.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.960
Let's weigh the pros
and cons, shall we?

03:07.960 --> 03:10.250
-First--
-We get the kibble.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.620
Always wanted
to drive a car.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.790
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.790
That's one-sided reasoning.

03:16.790 --> 03:19.420
-Come on!
-Need I remind you

03:19.420 --> 03:23.080
-It's not stealing.

03:23.080 --> 03:27.000
Stealing is when
you take something
and never bring it back.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.920
-This is borrowing.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.750
Cadpig:
That's it, Lucky, bend reality
until it works for you.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.170
Please, allow me.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.540
-Oh!
-That's quite all right.

04:00.540 --> 04:04.290
-It's far too heavy.
-I can manage.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.580
Both: Oh!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.080
Well, I never!

04:12.670 --> 04:15.250
-You--

04:15.250 --> 04:17.880
you get the map,
I'll get the bus.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.500
...997, 998,

04:21.500 --> 04:24.830
999! Aha!

04:24.830 --> 04:26.670
You're one short, Richard.

04:29.170 --> 04:32.710
Very clever,
but not clever enough!

04:32.710 --> 04:34.920
No one can feed a family
on what you make.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.920
You're stealing
from me, Robert.
I know you are!

04:41.420 --> 04:43.290
Now-- now
listen here, Cruella.

04:43.290 --> 04:45.790
I work hard,
I play fair,

04:45.790 --> 04:49.880
I don't steal,
and the name is Roger!

04:50.830 --> 04:53.080
Now, if you don't mind!

04:54.830 --> 04:55.830
Hmm.

05:04.380 --> 05:06.750
Hey, neighbor,
what's your rush?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.620
If you could just drop me
at the roost.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.790
Whoa! Ooh!

05:12.790 --> 05:14.880
Gah! Brake!

05:14.880 --> 05:16.830
Shift! Shift!

05:18.290 --> 05:19.330
Brake!

05:21.830 --> 05:23.710
I'm an excellent driver.

05:23.710 --> 05:25.750
-D-duck!
Low bridge?

05:25.750 --> 05:28.830
No! Duck! Duck!
Baby duck!

05:30.170 --> 05:32.040
Lucky: Whoa!

05:32.040 --> 05:34.790
I think I just
passed a giblet.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.540
Wow! Let's do that again.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.000
Here's Lucky
in front of a bucket.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
Oh, and here's Lucky
beside a bucket.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.830
And here's Lucky
actually inside a bucket.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.790
I wish Nanny would hurry up
and find the puppies.

06:18.790 --> 06:21.750
Well, Ricky,
that was fascinating.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.380
And now,
if you'll excuse me...

06:24.500 --> 06:27.540
Only a hundred more to go!

06:27.540 --> 06:29.170
Oh!

06:30.500 --> 06:32.710
Radio announcer:
It's munchie market mayhem

06:32.710 --> 06:34.960
at the Stiffle Food Fortress!

06:34.960 --> 06:38.750
So, rush on down
and get your free sample
of designer Kanine Krunchies

06:38.750 --> 06:39.670
-now, now, now!
-That's it!

06:39.670 --> 06:41.620
-They're headed
to the Food Fortress.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.880
Quick, find Stiffle
on the map.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.710
-I think we're lost.
-We are not lost.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.000
I prefer the term
"locationally challenged."

06:54.000 --> 06:56.500
I told you I know
where I'm going.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.620
Spot:
Look out!

07:09.620 --> 07:12.710
-Smooth sailing, Columbus.
-Hey, lighten up.

07:12.710 --> 07:14.620
It could be
a whole lot worse.

07:14.620 --> 07:17.250
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

07:17.250 --> 07:19.620
Lucky:
It just got worse.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.580
Mm-hmm!

07:22.580 --> 07:25.080
-Oh, and here's a rock
I found when I was four.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.920
Oh, oh! And a piece of lint
I found when I was six!

07:27.920 --> 07:30.120
Oh, hey, you're gonna love this.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.830
Here's a big hunk
of my appendix.

07:32.830 --> 07:35.420
I was wrong
about you, Rodney.

07:35.420 --> 07:36.540
You're not a thief.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.170
You're a fine,
upstanding citizen.

07:39.170 --> 07:40.710
A prince among men!

07:40.710 --> 07:44.960
So, if you don't mind,
I'd like to put an end
to this neighborly nonsense!

07:44.960 --> 07:47.710
You are right, Cruella.

07:47.710 --> 07:51.620
Let's end the nonsense
and start the show tunes!

07:54.000 --> 07:56.380
Course me and the boys
can fix her.

07:56.380 --> 07:59.000
-Piece of cheese--
I mean, cake.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.080
-Horace: Make a left!

08:04.080 --> 08:05.580
There is no left!

08:05.580 --> 08:07.620
You'll miss the shortcut!

08:07.620 --> 08:09.580
-Ooh! Oh!
-Hey!

08:12.330 --> 08:13.460
Get off me!

08:14.540 --> 08:17.120
Please go away.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.670
Oh! My brother's a cop!

08:26.380 --> 08:29.120
-Good as new.
-Great!

08:29.120 --> 08:31.210
Now, if you'll excuse us.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.120
Swamp Rat:
So, what's it gonna be,
chief

08:34.120 --> 08:35.460
Cash or credit?

08:38.620 --> 08:41.960
You see, we're a little bit
short right now, and--

08:41.960 --> 08:44.880
No problem.
We'll take it out in trade.

08:49.710 --> 08:52.460
-Oh!

08:52.460 --> 08:54.580
-Nanny: Oh!

08:54.580 --> 08:56.500
-Whoa!

08:58.250 --> 09:00.920
That... is gonna leave a mark.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.420
Come on! One more time!

09:07.420 --> 09:10.500
♪ This old man,
he played 1,004 ♪

09:10.500 --> 09:12.710
♪ He played knick-knack
on my poor... ♪

09:13.710 --> 09:16.580
Enough. No more snapshots,

09:16.580 --> 09:18.460
no more movies

09:18.460 --> 09:20.540
-no more show tunes!
-Whoa!

09:20.540 --> 09:22.750
I am leaving,
I am out of here,
I am gone!

09:22.750 --> 09:26.000
Hasta la vista, Ripcord!

09:31.250 --> 09:33.330
Ooh. Ah.

09:33.330 --> 09:36.920
Of all the ridiculous,
wasteful, boring afternoons!

09:36.920 --> 09:39.670
Cruella!

09:39.670 --> 09:41.710
What is it now?

09:41.710 --> 09:44.920
-I-- I love you.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.540
Uh, never mind.

09:50.540 --> 09:53.710
Horace, get the car!
I'm leaving!

09:53.710 --> 09:56.000
Horace?
Where are you, Horace?

09:57.960 --> 10:00.830
She's leaving.
That means you're leaving.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.920
That means I'm free.
I'm free!

10:02.920 --> 10:04.580
-Hooray!

10:10.920 --> 10:13.540
Ahh.

10:25.250 --> 10:29.790
What did I tell ya?
Piece of cake.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.500
-Horace: Yow!

10:32.500 --> 10:34.790
Piece of cake?

10:34.790 --> 10:36.540
Piece of pancake!

10:36.540 --> 10:38.330
We almost got flattened!

10:38.330 --> 10:40.420
We almost got eaten!

10:40.420 --> 10:43.420
And we are
completely Krunchie-less.

10:43.420 --> 10:47.500
Yeah, but we got the car back
without Cruella finding out.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.380
-We win!
-Roger: Lucky!

10:50.380 --> 10:54.460
You guys are
in a heap of trouble.
You stole a car!

10:54.460 --> 10:57.080
And don't think you were
just borrowing it,

10:57.080 --> 10:59.830
because borrowing involves
consent and agreement.

10:59.830 --> 11:01.380
Now, correct me
if I'm wrong,

11:01.380 --> 11:05.290
but I don't think
Cruella consented
to lending you her car.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.580
There's a con
we could've weighed.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.960
What's he so testy about?

11:11.960 --> 11:14.380
It's not like it was
grand theft auto.

11:14.380 --> 11:17.330
That's exactly
what it was, Cadpig.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.420
Picky, Picky.

11:20.710 --> 11:22.420
Hey, look on the bright side.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.330
It could've been a lot worse.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.330
-Well, howdy, howdy, howdy!

12:04.750 --> 12:06.380
Pug:
Listen up, mange hounds.

12:06.380 --> 12:09.580
Today is your last chance
to earn paw merits

12:09.580 --> 12:11.580
to become Cadet
of the Month!

12:11.580 --> 12:13.750
Strive to be the best.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.250
Do it for honor, for duty!

12:16.250 --> 12:19.580
-For...
-The giant T-bone steak.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.120
What did you say,
mop ears?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.540
The only reason
we have that steak

12:24.540 --> 12:28.460
is because Colonel Mamby-Pamby
thinks you should be rewarded

12:28.460 --> 12:30.420
instead of driven
into the ground

12:30.420 --> 12:33.500
like the lily-livered
dog spot you are!

12:34.710 --> 12:36.120
Ten-hut!

12:36.120 --> 12:38.500
But you and your friends'll
never get close enough

12:38.500 --> 12:40.620
to smell that piece of meat

12:40.620 --> 12:44.710
as long as a hard-working cadet
like Tripod is in the game.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.000
Dismissed!

12:47.420 --> 12:51.670
He's gonna eat those words,
and I'm gonna eat that steak.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.960
Get real, Lucky.
The deadline is today

12:54.960 --> 12:57.580
and Tripod's already
45 points ahead.

12:57.580 --> 13:00.290
Oh yeah?
Bark Brigade code,

13:00.290 --> 13:02.250
section three,
paragraph four:

13:02.250 --> 13:06.330
"Rescuing a superior officer
from a dangerous situation

13:06.330 --> 13:09.790
earns the rescuing cadet
60 paw merits."

13:09.790 --> 13:13.170
And that will beat Tripod.

13:13.170 --> 13:16.120
There's a fine line
between optimism and delusion,

13:16.120 --> 13:18.170
and you just blew past it.

13:18.170 --> 13:21.250
Who you gonna rescue?
No one's in danger.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.120
Not yet.

13:24.210 --> 13:27.170
Every day
at precisely 1200 hours,

13:27.170 --> 13:29.960
Lieutenant Pug recons
these garbage cans

13:29.960 --> 13:31.920
-for Nanny's
best table scraps.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.120
Oh.

13:36.460 --> 13:40.330
Lucky:
But today,
he gets a big surprise.

13:40.330 --> 13:44.040
I filled the can
with chewed-up bubble gum.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.710
He's stuck!

13:54.460 --> 13:58.330
That's your plan?
He gets stuck in bubble gum?

13:58.330 --> 14:01.250
Ooh! Scary.

14:01.250 --> 14:04.710
What's next? Have him trip
on a snickerdoodle?

14:04.710 --> 14:07.120
Next I get him unstuck,

14:07.120 --> 14:09.420
and bingo, Pug saved!

14:11.040 --> 14:15.250
You won't be laughing
when I've got 60 points
and a T-bone steak.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.790
Have you really
thought this through?

14:19.420 --> 14:22.880
-There's no time to think!
We have to act now.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.960
Besides, what could go wrong?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.500
The garbage truck could come
and take him away?

14:35.290 --> 14:38.920
Help.
-Of course we'll help.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.830
We're your siblings,
your family,

14:41.830 --> 14:45.290
and I think I speak
for all of us when I say,

14:45.290 --> 14:47.380
this is gonna cost ya.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.210
-We get a cut of the steak.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.000
Oh, man.
We're never
gonna find him here.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.250
Horace,
is that more goodies?

15:09.250 --> 15:11.330
Yes, sir, Miss De Vil.

15:11.330 --> 15:14.080
Here it comes.

15:15.750 --> 15:16.830
Ah!

15:16.830 --> 15:20.000
I can't believe
they just throw
this stuff away!

15:27.210 --> 15:29.960
Ah! People have been
telling me for years

15:29.960 --> 15:32.080
that my clothing line
is garbage,

15:32.080 --> 15:34.830
Oh, why didn't I listen?
From now on,

15:34.830 --> 15:40.040
Cruella's Recylcowear is
going to sweep the market!

15:40.040 --> 15:43.210
Spot: We'll never be able
to find Lieutenant Pug
in all this garbage!

15:43.210 --> 15:44.830
He's gone!

15:44.830 --> 15:47.210
A goner!
Gone forever!

15:47.210 --> 15:50.540
Going, going, gone!
Gone, gone, gone!

15:53.170 --> 15:55.580
Getting yourself a might
worked up there, little lady.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.210
-Swamp Rat!
-Appears to me

15:58.210 --> 16:01.670
you folks could
use the assistance
of an experienced garbologist--

16:01.670 --> 16:03.540
that's "trash picker"
to you--

16:03.540 --> 16:07.920
and I'd be just plum tickled
to help you out...

16:07.920 --> 16:09.750
-for a trifling...

16:09.750 --> 16:13.290
-50 percent of the T-bone.

16:13.290 --> 16:17.210
Forget it!
We're already
splitting it four ways!

16:17.210 --> 16:21.210
Fine with me.
Then I suggest you start looking
in the damaged dog section.

16:21.210 --> 16:24.880
Go down three refrigerators
and make a right at the pile
of heaping stench.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.960
When you can't stand
the stink anymore,
bear left.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.960
Okay, okay. I give.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.120
So, where is the lieutenant?

16:34.170 --> 16:36.540
I think
they're all around us!

16:36.540 --> 16:40.040
Get off me!
-Let's go, cadets.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.960
Bark Brigade
to the rescue!

16:41.960 --> 16:44.880
Now don't y'all
forget our deal!

16:44.880 --> 16:47.670
I'll be waiting
on that T-bone reward.

16:47.670 --> 16:50.000
-Don't worry, sir!
We'll save you!

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
-Whoa!

16:55.000 --> 16:57.540
-Run for it!

17:11.330 --> 17:12.750
-Whoa!
-Eee!

17:28.830 --> 17:30.250
Hmm?

17:37.420 --> 17:39.580
Puppies?
I should've known.

17:39.580 --> 17:44.540
Out, out! You're soiling
my beautiful garbage
with your filthy paws!

17:44.540 --> 17:47.210
Get out before
I recycle you myself!

17:47.210 --> 17:48.750
And stay out!

17:56.330 --> 17:59.000
It's up to you, Spot.
Haul tailfeathers.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.960
Yeah!

18:08.000 --> 18:09.670
We're trapped!

18:11.580 --> 18:13.960
You know, aggressive behavior

18:13.960 --> 18:17.040
is often overcompensation
for a deep insecurity.

18:17.040 --> 18:22.420
Don't worry.
I'm sure no one actually notices
your stubby tail anymore.

18:22.420 --> 18:25.710
-Or your ridiculous ears.

18:28.210 --> 18:31.670
Say, are those caps?

18:31.670 --> 18:35.000
Oh, now, with those types
of defects,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.500
do you really think
you have the right

18:36.500 --> 18:39.120
to pick on these
poor little puppies?

18:39.120 --> 18:40.790
No.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.040
Next.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.920
Remember: First the pain,

18:47.920 --> 18:49.960
-then the gain.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.380
Help!

18:53.380 --> 18:55.420
Hang-hang-hang on!

18:55.420 --> 18:57.330
Who's that, huh?

18:57.330 --> 19:00.880
Help!

19:02.830 --> 19:05.330
Spot! Where's Lieutenant Pug?

19:05.330 --> 19:08.460
He's still up there.
I couldn't get him loose!

19:08.460 --> 19:10.040
-Puppies: No!

19:26.080 --> 19:28.540
-Oh no.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.750
He's been recycled.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.380
What have I done?

19:32.380 --> 19:37.040
Oh, if only I hadn't tried
to win the easy way.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.920
Oh, if only I had
thought this through,

19:39.920 --> 19:42.040
Lieutenant Pug
would still be here...

19:42.040 --> 19:44.830
instead of--
instead of being...

19:44.830 --> 19:46.790
Wearable art?

19:49.290 --> 19:52.170
It's all my fault.
-Ooh!

19:52.170 --> 19:55.620
You spotted vermin!
Look what you've done!

19:55.620 --> 19:57.790
There's dog hair
in the machine!

19:57.790 --> 19:59.380
My garbage is a mess!

19:59.380 --> 20:01.790
I'll sue you
for everything you've got!

20:06.380 --> 20:09.330
The Cadet
of the Month Ceremony
is about to start.

20:09.330 --> 20:12.540
Somebody should tell
the Colonel what happened.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.330
I can't believe
what I've done.

20:16.330 --> 20:19.250
I'll resign
from the Brigade.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.920
I'll build a shrine
to Lieutenant Pug.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.170
I'll, I'll--
I'll become a hermit
and devote my life

20:26.170 --> 20:30.380
to his teeny-tiny
pathetic little memory.

20:33.380 --> 20:37.120
You never know what
you'll miss until one day
it's gone.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.080
It is kinda funny.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.880
I'd give
a whole bowl of kibble

20:41.880 --> 20:44.000
just to hear
Lieutenant Pug shout.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.540
Pug: All right,
you tick transports!

20:46.540 --> 20:47.750
Ten-shun!

20:47.750 --> 20:51.290
-Lieutenant Pug!

20:51.290 --> 20:53.040
He's alive!

20:53.040 --> 20:57.710
For extreme bravery
and for rescuing
a superior officer,

20:57.710 --> 21:01.500
the Cadet of the Month Award
and the T-bone steak

21:01.500 --> 21:05.750
go to honorary
Bark Brigade cadet,
the swamp rat.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.380
All:
Swamp Rat?

21:08.380 --> 21:10.710
-Oh yeah!

21:12.880 --> 21:14.250
Dismissed!

21:19.000 --> 21:20.790
What a rip.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.920
Frankly, I like mine
medium rare,

21:24.920 --> 21:27.420
-but this'll have to do.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.670
After Tripod worked
so hard all month,

21:29.670 --> 21:31.830
Swamp Rat
swooped right in and...

21:35.960 --> 21:39.790
-Uh...
Be thankful.

21:39.790 --> 21:42.580
At least Lieutenant Pug
doesn't know whose
fault it was.

21:42.580 --> 21:46.540
Oh yeah, runt pup?
Who says he doesn't?

21:46.540 --> 21:50.830
So, you wanted to earn
some easy paw merits, huh?

21:52.830 --> 21:56.750
It's the new Bark Brigade
recycling program.

21:56.750 --> 22:00.580
Helping your community
gets you 45 paw merits.
