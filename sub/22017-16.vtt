00:03.440 --> 00:04.950
They're looking for somebody
for their new campaign.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.866
- So, what do they want me to do?
- New Orleans Pride.

00:06.890 --> 00:09.080
Pick your face up off the
ground, Maurice. I'm back.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.180
I can't wait to get in the
hotel with just you and me.

00:11.190 --> 00:12.500
I got to go finish packing.

00:12.530 --> 00:14.930
- Meet your grandson.
- Hey, Jayden. I'm Cotton.

00:14.970 --> 00:16.250
Thought I was going

00:17.770 --> 00:19.440

to a song I wrote?</i>

00:19.470 --> 00:20.720
You could give it to
someone at the label.

00:24.380 --> 00:25.400
Carlotta...

The sponsor called.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.560
Somebody else caught their eye.
You.

check came two weeks ago.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.550
I was just trying to
spruce the place up.

00:35.590 --> 00:36.736

TV-ready for the live show,
I got it covered here.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.560
I already prepped
Andy and Angel.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.800
Want me to call Maurice,
have him come pick you up?

03:37.670 --> 03:39.160
Wow.

03:40.270 --> 03:41.510
That man is stupid.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.440
He had himself a dime.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.580

03:55.160 --> 03:57.560

Cotton. The girls.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.790
Now Noah.

04:02.830 --> 04:05.560
I just can't let one ball drop.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.400
Go home. My shift.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.940
My heart ain't so bad
I can't sit here

04:12.970 --> 04:14.810
and cover my grandpa duties.

04:19.180 --> 04:21.480
Yeah. Okay.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.490
So, Natalie, you hired
your own security firm

04:30.520 --> 04:31.690
and charged my label.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.560
It's called capitalism.

04:33.590 --> 04:35.860
Natalie also got our artists
some great exposure.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.500
Come on, all promoters get
kickbacks here and there.

04:38.530 --> 04:39.930
Not on my watch.

04:39.970 --> 04:42.830
You're both fired. Get out.

04:42.870 --> 04:44.870
Bitch, please.

04:44.900 --> 04:48.240
You sure about that?

04:48.270 --> 04:51.080
I walk, they're off their
game for <i> Hot Track Live.</i>

04:51.110 --> 04:52.850
And you and I both
know they need to get

04:52.860 --> 04:54.560
Sound House on board
for Noah's tour.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.156
I just fired you, and
you're still trying me

04:56.180 --> 04:58.250
with this cheap smooth talk?
Get out.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.250
Oh, but I'm right. And
so is my A&R game.

05:01.290 --> 05:03.250
I do it better than
anyone at this label.

05:03.290 --> 05:05.690
See, you've been looking
for Midtown's crown jewel

05:05.730 --> 05:06.960
since you got here.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.460
I could help you find one.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.480
But if you fire me, I
work for the competition.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.680
Don't beg, Mo.

05:17.800 --> 05:21.170
Bring me an artist to
back up your promises.

05:21.210 --> 05:23.710
Or you're done here.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.920
Wow.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.180
I just got fired. You
just saved your ass.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.780
Look, I put in too
much work here

05:29.800 --> 05:31.020
not to fight for what's mine.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.620
Now, I find the next big
thing, I make my name.

05:33.650 --> 05:35.236
You know, I remember
when you used to be

05:35.260 --> 05:37.520
all talk and cheap shoes.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.060
Now, you're just hella arrogant.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.790
And I know what I want.

05:40.830 --> 05:43.220
Which is why we always
work well together.

05:44.060 --> 05:45.580
So, where you gonna start?

05:46.200 --> 05:47.540
The club. Internet.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.510
I'm-a go old school,
like back in the day.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.900

right under your nose.

the dark one, Crane...

05:54.620 --> 05:56.216

bigger than her father.

break up Carlotta's girls.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.280

actually used to make us

06:01.310 --> 06:04.480
call you Clive as interns? Yeah.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.580
Get the Crane girl...

06:06.700 --> 06:08.660
before someone else does.

06:12.390 --> 06:14.360
Hey, how's it going?

06:14.390 --> 06:16.190
Sorry, I'm late. I
was at the hospital.

06:16.230 --> 06:18.000
They said everything
is going good,

06:18.030 --> 06:20.410
but I got to get out of here and
rehearse for <i> Hot Track Live.</i>

06:20.430 --> 06:22.900

has been moved up.

No, no, Carlotta, we can't
let the girls down.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.020
No, I know. I'm-I'm-a fix it.

09:06.230 --> 09:07.470
You cool with that?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.700
Everybody gets a time
to shine, right?

09:11.800 --> 09:13.240
It's her turn.

09:13.270 --> 09:14.970
Yeah, but what if she pops off?

09:15.010 --> 09:16.070
What then?

09:17.040 --> 09:19.740
Don't try to play me, Maurice.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.710
Stay out of our business.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.900
Focus on breaking
your new artist.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.710
You're dropping
us from the show?

09:33.740 --> 09:36.380
I have to drop someone... we
only have 12 minutes on air.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.480
That's only enough
time for two acts.

09:38.530 --> 09:41.500
Noah is a lock because I have
to get his tour up and going.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.530
And he has "So Sick" with Alex,

09:43.570 --> 09:46.000
so Take Three is a natural
choice for that second spot.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.600
Have you seen the
Spotify charts?

09:47.640 --> 09:49.470
We have "Can't Stop
Loving Her" soaring.

09:49.510 --> 09:52.220
It doesn't matter. Alex is hot.
Noah's a name.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.160
Yeah, my uncle's not
your favorite person.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.560
This was purely a
business decision.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.740
I'll give you two a few minutes.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.620
This is not business.

10:04.660 --> 10:07.020
No, see, this is on Jahil.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.390
Damn!

10:08.430 --> 10:10.130
Now we're paying
the consequences.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.010
You know, as long as we're
getting repped by that snake,

10:12.030 --> 10:13.500
we're gonna keep getting bit.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.370
Maybe we split up to get free.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.860
Bro... we weren't
signed as solo artists.

10:20.910 --> 10:23.310
Yeah, what choice do
we have right now?

10:23.340 --> 10:25.240
He's not here.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.980
We got to make some moves. We
got to get from under him.

10:28.010 --> 10:30.580
So, what do you suggest?

10:30.620 --> 10:32.500
I don't know, man.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.120
I think we got to split up.

10:35.490 --> 10:36.990
All right.

10:38.590 --> 10:41.760
Okay, I got to go, I'm, uh, I'm
late for a meeting at the label.

10:41.790 --> 10:43.840
I'll, uh, I'll be back.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.960
I told you, I don't want you
donating blood for Jayden.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.110
I don't know where you've
been, who you've been with,

10:50.140 --> 10:51.280
or what you're
walking around with.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.120
You will not put your
blood in my son.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.510
- You came looking for me.
- I was looking for Arnold.

10:55.540 --> 10:58.710
Nakisha, you're a ho. You
is the biggest ho I know.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.390
You practically raped me,
and I haven't even been

11:00.410 --> 11:02.650
- with a woman since.
- Wait up, ain't nobody rape you.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.390
Okay, ladies, stop, stop it.
All right? You're both

11:04.400 --> 11:06.180
talking crazy 'cause
you're scared.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.320
Jayden needs both his
parents on the same page.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.480
He has one parent, and
I can make a choice

11:10.520 --> 11:12.166
- on who donates blood.
- Well, actually, they want

11:12.190 --> 11:14.480
the whole family to
donate if they can.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.490
All right? Just in case
Jayden needs surgery.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.330
You can donate.

11:20.370 --> 11:21.970
But I don't feel comfortable

11:22.000 --> 11:24.870
with Arnold or Cotton or
whatever you call yourself.

11:29.270 --> 11:32.580

12:59.510 --> 13:02.680
Somebody tried to break into
your grandma's house last night.

I don't know what you're telling him for.
What he care?

13:04.590 --> 13:06.550
Grandma, that is not true.

I packed your things,

13:13.100 --> 13:14.790
We're not moving in together.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.720
I'm getting my own
spot, off Broughton.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.760
But I heard a few houses
in the neighborhood

13:19.800 --> 13:20.820
been getting robbed.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.880
They just hit Ms. Dotson house,

13:22.940 --> 13:25.000
about two blocks away.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.980
You know they stole
her damn dentures?

13:27.020 --> 13:29.250
You got to be pretty hard up
to steal somebody's teeth.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.079
I mean, they <i> was</i> gold-plated.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.720
It ain't nothing but
them little gangbangers

13:32.740 --> 13:35.359
hanging around on the
street like it's 1992.

Hey, y'all not
gonna say nothing?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.520
What we supposed to say?

13:39.140 --> 13:41.680
You know we can't
call the police.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.290
You know ain't nobody doing
no snitching around here.

13:44.330 --> 13:46.430
Hmm.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.630
Mm.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.170
Yo, Alex,

13:54.200 --> 13:56.940
I sent you a song that I think
would be good for your voice.

13:58.340 --> 14:01.570
Yeah, okay, I know you're
focused on Take Three.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.040
Just take a listen.
It's worth it.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.240
Hey, there you are.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.010
So, how'd it go, huh?

14:07.050 --> 14:08.950
I'm sorry I missed the
meeting earlier, nephew.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.750
I'm not your nephew.

14:10.790 --> 14:12.390
Ayanna dropped us
from <i> Hot Track Live.</i>

14:12.420 --> 14:13.630
What do you mean,
Ayanna dropped you?

14:13.650 --> 14:14.720
What? I'll go talk to her.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.340
I don't want you to do anything.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.916
Andy and I are done;
we finally found a way

14:17.940 --> 14:19.500
to get out of our

14:19.530 --> 14:20.660
We're splitting up.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.100
just take a beat, all right?

14:23.160 --> 14:24.880

14:25.170 --> 14:26.470
But let me tell you something,

14:26.500 --> 14:28.259
your act is too good
to let it go now.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.270
I'll take my chances.

you to still be rehearsing?

Three million people are gonna
be watching us on TV tomorrow.

late to be rehearsing.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.090

16:28.700 --> 16:30.400
And you're bothering me.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.630
What else is new?

16:36.760 --> 16:38.520
I'm in a girl group.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.230
And I'm in here working
my damn ass off

16:41.270 --> 16:43.800
the night before a
performance by myself.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.580
I see Alex popping off so easy,

16:46.980 --> 16:49.599
and the only thing
I can think is...

16:49.600 --> 16:51.600
that should be me.

16:51.650 --> 16:54.280
You know, the first time
I sang for somebody,

16:54.320 --> 16:56.850
I got pissed off, 'cause
they told me I was good.

16:58.690 --> 16:59.820
"Good."

16:59.850 --> 17:01.120
I didn't want to hear that.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.860
I wanted to hear them
say I was great.

17:03.960 --> 17:07.400
Listen to me, Star,
that fire right there,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.130
that's your VIP ticket to
everything you ever wanted.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.900
I saw that in you the first
time you ever sang for me.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.839
You're the real deal, Star.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.079
All right.

17:25.859 --> 17:27.420
Well, I'm rehearsing.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.680
So if you could
let me do that...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.490
Oh, by the way, um,

17:32.520 --> 17:35.350
you were a little late on
that last eight count.

17:35.390 --> 17:36.990
Jahil, you know...

17:37.030 --> 17:39.160

18:05.460 --> 18:07.330
- Headed to the hospital?
- No.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.199

about me being there.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.580

Could you...?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.830

got to take this.

18:12.870 --> 18:15.470

What's going on, Alex?

Look, if it makes you
feel any better,

33:03.880 --> 33:06.500
we didn't get to
perform either, so...

33:07.440 --> 33:10.500
Me and Andy broke up just to get
out of our contract with Jahil.

33:11.080 --> 33:14.160
Everything I worked for is over.

33:19.250 --> 33:20.610
And, you know what,

33:20.650 --> 33:23.100
everything leads back to him.

33:25.380 --> 33:26.620
I grew up...

33:27.590 --> 33:29.380
looking up to him.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.820
And I can't even trust him.

33:34.630 --> 33:36.400
I can't trust anyone.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.570
You can trust me.

I know that we haven't
been talking, but...

33:46.540 --> 33:48.140
I want to trust you.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.110
But you keep a lot
of things inside.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.200
Yeah, well,

33:54.940 --> 33:57.420
there are some things...

33:57.700 --> 33:59.920
that are not so
easy to talk about.

34:01.690 --> 34:04.100
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.480
I promise.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.340
Well, okay.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.620
My, uh...

34:18.040 --> 34:20.139
my foster father...

34:23.080 --> 34:24.980
Otis...

34:26.699 --> 34:27.900
he...

34:30.500 --> 34:33.120
he did some things...

34:34.190 --> 34:35.360
that...

34:35.389 --> 34:37.620
that I didn't want him to do.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.530
You don't have to
say anything else.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.860
Okay.

34:47.870 --> 34:50.199
I love you.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.360
Star reminded me of Etta James.

35:18.020 --> 35:19.520
She was open,

35:19.700 --> 35:22.240
raw, ready.

35:22.270 --> 35:23.670
The crowd loved her.

35:23.710 --> 35:25.510
So why are you
trippin', Maurice?

35:25.540 --> 35:27.820
You already have your Star.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.880
Yeah, Carlotta would flip
if I push Star to go solo.

35:30.910 --> 35:32.910
But Star, that girl,

35:32.950 --> 35:34.640
she's a force to
be reckoned with.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.660
Do I walk away from that?

35:40.240 --> 35:42.090
You love Carlotta.

35:43.590 --> 35:45.230
You can't even hide it.

35:45.260 --> 35:47.260
I don't want to hurt her.

35:47.340 --> 35:49.180
So you're willing to
sacrifice your career

35:49.300 --> 35:52.200
for her feelings, Mo?

35:52.230 --> 35:53.870
You're acting like a newbie.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.540
Star wouldn't

35:55.570 --> 35:56.700
just give you Midtown.

35:57.020 --> 35:59.280
She's capable of
delivering the world.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.060
You know that.

36:04.250 --> 36:05.880
Sorry I'm late.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.250
Sorry.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.059
I was just explaining that

36:09.060 --> 36:10.680
Jayden's kidneys
are shutting down.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.420
We have to stabilize him
and then begin dialysis.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.160
What does that mean?

36:15.190 --> 36:17.560
You gonna have to find
him a new kidney.

36:17.570 --> 36:18.580
Mm-hmm.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.840
- He could have one of mine.
- No...

36:20.860 --> 36:23.030
- Bitch, that's my child, too.
- Cot.

36:23.070 --> 36:25.670
It doesn't matter.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.900
Unfortunately, neither
of you is a match.

36:27.940 --> 36:30.450
I've already put Jayden
on the UNOS list,

36:30.460 --> 36:33.040
so now it's-it's
just a waiting game.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.010
Doc, in the meantime,

36:35.040 --> 36:36.910
you can test me. And
anyone else we know,

36:36.950 --> 36:38.380
for that matter.

36:53.660 --> 36:55.430
What you doing?

36:55.460 --> 36:56.710
You're gonna hide
in here all night?

36:56.730 --> 36:58.300
Yo,

36:58.400 --> 37:00.300
thanks for having
my back tonight.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.700
Course.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.700
They ate it up. We're trending.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.710
Yeah, I saw that,

37:05.740 --> 37:08.380
but I didn't see any tweets
about how good the song was.

37:08.410 --> 37:11.180
Oh, my God, Noah,
you're so sensitive.

37:11.210 --> 37:13.100
It's some of your best work.

37:13.140 --> 37:14.740
You don't need a tweet
to tell you that.

37:19.990 --> 37:22.220
I was wasted when I wrote it.

37:25.360 --> 37:28.260
Thought you were done with that.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.300
So did I.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.720
Old habits are hard
to break, right?

37:44.750 --> 37:47.680
Noah! Noah! Are you
stepping out on Alex?

37:47.720 --> 37:50.220
Are you and Star together?
Is she inside?

37:50.250 --> 37:52.266
- It's not even like that.
- But you just sang with her.

37:52.290 --> 37:53.990
Is she replacing Alex?

37:54.020 --> 37:56.060
Look, she just filled in, all right?
That's it.

37:56.090 --> 37:57.920
Nobody can replace Alex.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.930
No-Noah! - Noah, Noah,

37:59.960 --> 38:01.900
what is your relationship
status with Alex?

38:01.960 --> 38:04.200
What did you think
of her performance?

38:08.970 --> 38:11.560
It's my job as your
manager to protect you.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.070
You need to be in rehab.

38:13.110 --> 38:14.810
- What? Come on.
- Look, you heard me.

38:14.820 --> 38:15.839
We got to figure this out.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.600
Sound House saw your performance

38:17.620 --> 38:20.360
on <i> Hot Track Live,</i> and
they loved your new song.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.480
They want to hear
your entire album.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.650
Really?

38:24.690 --> 38:27.590
Uh, that's-that's amazing.

38:27.620 --> 38:28.620
- O-Okay.
- I told you.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.660
It's all good.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.990
Congrats, Noah Brooks.

38:32.030 --> 38:34.140
You're one step closer
to a national tour.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.900
I-I can't believe this.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.760
Whatever the hell you've
been doing to get here,

38:38.780 --> 38:40.120
keep doing it.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.346
Because it's working to finally

38:41.370 --> 38:43.140
get you back on top.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.960
Oh, my God.

39:08.060 --> 39:09.520
I'm ready.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.780
You sure? We can wait
as long as you want.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.070
You said you love me, right?

39:19.820 --> 39:21.180
Yeah.

39:31.220 --> 39:33.450
God, that's Miss Carlotta.
Go, go, go.

39:33.490 --> 39:34.939
Go, go, go.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.259
I mean, what difference
does it make now?

39:36.260 --> 39:38.099
- Everything's on the table already.
- Go, go. Just go.

39:38.100 --> 39:39.380
I'm not here.

39:43.070 --> 39:44.500
Are you Angel Rivera?

39:45.700 --> 39:46.820
Yeah.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.300
Please sign here.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.820
What is it?

39:57.010 --> 39:59.610
It's a letter from Immigration.

40:05.140 --> 40:07.420
They denied my DACA application.

40:10.430 --> 40:12.180
I got a notice to appear.

40:29.910 --> 40:32.810
Where have you been?
At the label, right?

40:32.850 --> 40:35.050
- I'm sorry. This week has been crazy.
- This week?

40:35.090 --> 40:36.450
My whole damn life.

40:36.490 --> 40:38.290
First, it was the music.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.190
Then Mary. Then Mary's girls.

40:40.220 --> 40:42.220
Now Noah. I needed
you this week.

40:42.260 --> 40:44.140
- I know.
- I blame you for this.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.460
- Hey, don't talk to your mother like that.
- When I ran off

40:46.480 --> 40:47.939
to be with Grandma, you told me

40:47.940 --> 40:49.830
don't come back until
I became a man.

40:49.870 --> 40:51.930
So I tried to be a man,

40:51.970 --> 40:54.340
and I got with Nakisha
for you, so that you

40:54.370 --> 40:56.170
- would take me back.
- I'm sorry.

40:56.210 --> 40:58.410
Now my son is about to die

40:58.440 --> 41:01.000
because I tried to be
something that I wasn't.

41:10.290 --> 41:11.400
Jax?

41:11.620 --> 41:12.920
What's up?

41:12.960 --> 41:14.480
This is your track?

41:14.520 --> 41:16.956
Yeah, it was, um... I was hoping
