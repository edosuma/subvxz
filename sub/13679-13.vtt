American Gothic...
So, Dad wasn't Silver Bells...

00:03.570 --> 00:04.741
he was a copycat.

00:04.739 --> 00:06.369
Jennifer Windham--

00:06.374 --> 00:08.514
<i> you killed her, didn't you?</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:10.679
Say it!
I had to.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.638
I'm asking you
what you think I should do

00:12.646 --> 00:14.746
I got rid
of the bells.

00:14.749 --> 00:16.679
MADELINE: <i> You made a decision</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:18.554

SOPHIE: <i> You know the bear</i>
<i> Uncle Garrett gave you?</i>

00:20.087 --> 00:22.017
I recorded a message
for you on it.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.023
Christina, it's Garrett.
I got to know.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.555
I'm gonna be a father.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.659
Christina's pregnant.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.661
BRADY: John Martin.
That's the Silver Bells Killer.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.803
MADELINE:
<i> There is someone</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:33.768

00:33.768 --> 00:35.398
Dara Martin was born in 1986,

00:35.403 --> 00:38.043
the only child
of John and Brigid.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.509
BRADY:
<i> Dara Martin is the accomplice.</i>

00:40.508 --> 00:41.768
Which means SBK murdered
all these people

00:41.776 --> 00:43.206
with his own daughter.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.680
<i> This is someone</i>

00:45.679 --> 00:46.609
I told you to leave.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.054
I'm sorry, Alison...

00:48.049 --> 00:51.119

That policeman
stationed outside your house

01:28.789 --> 01:30.489
keeps driving
over my flowerbeds.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.691
My nasturtiums
have been decimated.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.232
That's yet another

01:34.228 --> 01:36.628
HOA infraction-- your fifth.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.300
I'm sorry your flowers
are struggling, Phyllis.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.800
My family and I are receiving

01:40.801 --> 01:42.841
psychotic death threats
from a killer.

01:42.837 --> 01:44.697
I don't think that cop
in the driveway's

01:44.705 --> 01:46.235
going to protect you.
When I drove past him

01:46.240 --> 01:47.870
this morning,
he was asleep at the wheel.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.716
You're dismissed.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.348
But wait. Huh?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.824
I'm supposed to wait here

02:01.822 --> 02:04.792
and look for suspicious
characters and all that.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.562
You didn't notice him?

02:07.561 --> 02:08.860
Is he...?

02:08.863 --> 02:10.763
Sh-Should I arrest him?

02:10.764 --> 02:13.474
He's private security.

02:13.467 --> 02:17.267
A crazed doll maker seems intent
on killing my entire family.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.741
Instead of relying on
the C-minus protection

02:19.740 --> 02:21.410
of a narcoleptic
beat cop,

02:21.408 --> 02:25.308
I decided to go with the best
that money could buy.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.712
Come on, Russo.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.891
I'm kind of rooting
for the doll maker.

02:33.888 --> 02:36.188
(engine starts)

02:39.259 --> 02:41.929
Okay, you get a button,
you get a flag.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.299
Thanks for being here.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.197
Cheers.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.829
Hey, you're flying solo.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.274
I thought maybe your
"friend" would be with you?

02:49.270 --> 02:51.500
Your implied ironic
quotation marks are unnecessary.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.835
April and I really
are just friends.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.841
Hmm.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.483
All right, you're not
supposed to date

02:57.478 --> 02:58.908
within the first
12 months of recovery,

02:58.913 --> 03:02.923
so we are enjoying our year
of living... platonically.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.517
Sounds like a long year.
Hey, you made it.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.289
Yeah, just being supportive.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.348
Well, this seems like the safest
place for us to be right now.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.916
Alison brought in
a lot of extra security.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.386
Do you know how long it takes
to count all the votes?

03:14.395 --> 03:17.555
I think it's an all-day,
all-night kind of a thing.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.825
But it'll be fun. We got
balloons! We got snacks!

03:19.833 --> 03:21.433
Oh, yeah.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.895
Come on, let's go wish
Alison good luck.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.743
Oh, I think she's outside
giving interviews.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.408
No, I was just there.
She's not there.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.607
She's not backstage either.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.240
Has anyone seen Alison
at all this morning?

03:36.916 --> 03:39.546
JOHN:
<i> I lost her.</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:43.863
I lost her because the hospital
prioritized patients with money.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.832
That never should've happened.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.329
Brigid should still be here.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.403
And now my daughter... (sighs)

03:55.402 --> 03:58.942
she has to grow up
without her mother.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.439
And someone
has to answer for that.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.239
John Roy Martin gave
this deposition as part of

04:05.246 --> 04:08.806
a malpractice suit against
Fisher Hill Hospital in 1997.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.316
Hospital lawyers
outmaneuvered him,

04:10.317 --> 04:12.017
and eventually the case
was dismissed.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.689
Two years later,
SBK's first victim was killed.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.559
Brian Long--
a wealthy entrepreneur

04:17.558 --> 04:20.428
who'd made a sizeable donation
to Fisher Hill Hospital.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.927
Now, these murders are
not a matter of making

04:22.930 --> 04:25.030
a general statement
about income inequality.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.932
They're about John and his
daughter Dara getting revenge.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.365
(phone buzzing, ringing)

04:29.370 --> 04:31.000
Escalating threats indicate

04:31.005 --> 04:34.005
that Dara's planning
to strike again. Soon.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.438
Hey.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.842
We can't find Alison.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.044
She's not picking up her phone,

04:38.045 --> 04:40.045
and she missed
an interview this morning.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.577
When was the last time
someone saw her?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.753
A staffer saw her
in her office last night.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.022
But what if she's...

04:46.020 --> 04:49.760
What if the accomplice
has got her?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.817
¶ ¶

04:53.526 --> 04:54.756
BRADY:
<i> Tessa said</i>

04:54.762 --> 04:56.562
she was at the office.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.903
What if the
accomplice is someone

04:57.898 --> 04:59.528
who's worked her way
inside the campaign?

04:59.533 --> 05:01.673
Cutter, Ross.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.003
Alison Hawthorne's
cell phone's off,

05:05.005 --> 05:08.035
but we were still able
to use locational data

05:08.042 --> 05:11.042
to pinpoint
her last coordinates.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.550
Boston PD! Freeze!

05:22.556 --> 05:25.686
Hands in the air!
Get down on the ground, now!

05:25.693 --> 05:27.063
Brady?

05:30.830 --> 05:32.700
What the hell?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.470
NAOMI:
<i> For the last month,</i>

05:34.468 --> 05:37.638
I have been secretly working
with the dockworkers' union.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.738
What is your
Social Security number?

05:41.708 --> 05:43.508
I thought the union
was in Conley's pocket.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.480
But last night, Naomi told me
I could swing their vote my way

05:46.480 --> 05:47.950
if I could guarantee
favorable arbitration

05:47.948 --> 05:50.718
in their next negotiation
with the shippers.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.918
We started hammering out
the details last night.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.820
It took a little longer
than I expected.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.052
But, Alison,

05:56.056 --> 05:58.416
some lunatic is
targeting you right now.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.125
You can't just sneak off
to some secret warehouse

06:00.127 --> 06:01.457
without telling anyone.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.032
I was with Naomi
the whole time.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.030
Yeah, well, for all we know,
Naomi could be that lunatic.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.102
We've determined that the
accomplice is SBK's daughter,

06:08.102 --> 06:10.442
and we know that she's
in her early 30s now.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.997
You think Naomi...?
No.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.105
I just did a quick
background check.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.138
She is and always
has been Naomi Flynn.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.783
Both parents still living.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.978
Can't be her.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.849
We had to
chase her down.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.679
In the meantime,

06:23.684 --> 06:26.084
the Bureau's got people
looking for something on Dara.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.786
School photos,
juvie records...

06:27.788 --> 06:29.118
They won't find anything.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.863
Martin did a good job
of keeping himself off the grid.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.159
It's even easier
to keep a child off the grid.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.161
It's the digital
age, Ross.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.763
Everybody's got a record
of existence somewhere.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.096
You know, we keep thinking
of Dara as being ruthless

06:41.101 --> 06:44.041
and methodical, but, you know
what, she's also emotional.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.137
This is someone whose
whole raison d'être

06:46.140 --> 06:49.040
is avenging the
loss of her mother.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.842
"Raison d'être"?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.014
Yeah, "reason for being."

06:52.012 --> 06:53.682
No, I-I know what it means.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.610
I...

06:55.616 --> 06:58.676
Just never thought of you
as a French phrase kind of guy.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.185
All I'm saying is
Dara probably pays her mother

07:01.188 --> 07:04.458
a visit from time to time,
so maybe we should, too.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.163
Raison.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.603
(applause)

07:12.599 --> 07:14.799
ALISON:
<i> I'm so sorry for the delay.</i>

07:14.802 --> 07:16.742
Thank you all for being here.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.197
I know it hasn't
been easy,

07:19.206 --> 07:20.906
but here we are.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.568
We made it.
We're still standing.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.076
And that's entirely due

07:25.078 --> 07:26.478
to your unflagging loyalty,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.210
hard work,
and tenacity.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.915
You held tight to the mission
all the way to the end.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.919
Many of us have been
in this fight

07:33.921 --> 07:36.221
together since the
beginning, and I'm thrilled

07:36.223 --> 07:38.963
to have this opportunity...
Hey.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.759
Um, I got your letter.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.062
Can we go
somewhere to talk?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.934
ALISON: I'm proud
of the campaign we ran.
(softly): Yeah.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.804
And I'm eternally
thankful for all of you

07:49.803 --> 07:51.203
for sticking by me
the whole way.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.195
Thank you.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.806
(applause)

07:55.809 --> 07:59.639
Ali, we can't stick by you
unless we know where you are.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.546
I'm so sorry
for worrying you guys.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.178
I just had to make
one final maneuver.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.183
Okay, but next time, charge your
cell phone when you maneuver.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.246
Yeah, fair enough.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.889
You okay?

08:10.891 --> 08:13.191
I'm just nervous.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.663
We're safe here. I promise you.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.502
There's security guards
everywhere,

08:17.498 --> 08:18.758
metal detectors at the door.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.195
Except that the person
targeting us

08:20.200 --> 08:22.270
doesn't need a gun or a knife.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.769
Just a belt.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.682
(bell tinkling)

08:36.883 --> 08:38.283
(bag zipping)

08:49.829 --> 08:52.959
(doorbell rings)

08:52.966 --> 08:54.996
Expecting someone?

08:55.002 --> 08:56.072
No.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.139
(pounding on door)

09:00.072 --> 09:01.572
(doorbell rings)

09:04.143 --> 09:05.913
(pounding on door)

09:10.016 --> 09:11.916
Who are you?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.919
I'm Sophie.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.591
Cam's wife.

09:17.223 --> 09:21.193
Please tell Hercules I'm your
daughter-in-law, Madeline.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.664
You can let her in.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.244
Former daughter-in-law.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.097
Yeah.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.765
You won.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.244
He kicked me out for good.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.312
I won't fight
your lawyer on custody.

09:38.312 --> 09:41.682
I'm leaving town.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.222
Cam has some of my photos
of Jack in his room.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.917
I was hoping to grab them.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.816
Please?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.230
It's just some pictures.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.329
And I'll be out of your life.

10:00.299 --> 10:02.229
You can follow her upstairs.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.095
Make sure the photos
are all she takes.

10:16.148 --> 10:17.618
Thank you.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.950
TESSA:
Hey, what's wrong?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.986
Why are you out here?

10:24.992 --> 10:28.662
I'm worried my brain isn't
going to develop correctly.

10:31.263 --> 10:33.633
What makes you say that?

10:33.634 --> 10:36.844
Studies show that hearing
your mother's voice

10:36.837 --> 10:40.137
releases neuropeptides
into your brain.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.270
And those help develop
social communication skills.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.276
And I need those.

10:46.279 --> 10:50.019
You won't even
let me see her anymore.

10:50.017 --> 10:53.317
I don't even have that stupid
bear Uncle Garrett gave me.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.790
She recorded a message
for me on it,

10:55.789 --> 10:57.989
and you made us
leave Grandma's so fast

10:57.991 --> 10:58.321
I didn't even get to grab it.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.962
CAM: Hang tight, buddy.
I'll get that bear for you.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.869
Be right back.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.439
...very upbeat here,
as you can imagine.

11:11.438 --> 11:15.108
I know I should've told you that
a long time ago.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.038
Yeah, but, um...

11:18.045 --> 11:20.345
I'm glad I know
everything now.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.677
I'm glad I know my father was
standing up for what's right.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.392
Look, when... when we talked

11:32.324 --> 11:36.294
I thought maybe there
might be a chance for us.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.429
Maybe there could be.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.365
Could be?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.240
But I can't
stay here.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.768
Too many bad memories.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.244
I got a job.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.942
Starts next week.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.384
San Francisco.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.710
We could give this a shot.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.151
Just not here.

12:05.191 --> 12:08.361
I don't think
I can leave my family again.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.931
Just not with everything
that's going on.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.970
Is there any chance
I can... get you to stay?

12:21.741 --> 12:22.871
No.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.453
Here it is.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.316
Can't remember
anybody coming by.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.534
Although I don't make
a habit of staring.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.827
I try and keep
my peepers to myself.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.365
Any surveillance
on the premises?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.497
Visitors'
records, maybe?

12:48.502 --> 12:51.772
We don't get many visitors.

12:51.772 --> 12:55.472
Truthfully, I'm not sure people
like cemeteries all that much.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.148
I'm sorry I made us drive
all the way out here.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.792
Ah.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.247
It was worth a try.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.892
(sighs)

13:13.459 --> 13:15.859
REPORTER: Early reports show
incumbent mayor Bill Conley

13:15.862 --> 13:18.462
ahead by a razor-thin margin
of 1,200 votes.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.425
(doorbell rings)
That margin could very easily

13:20.433 --> 13:22.103
be overtaken by Hawthorne-Price,

13:22.102 --> 13:24.102
who campaigned hard
in several suburban districts

13:24.104 --> 13:26.474
which are yet to be counted.
Russo?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.313
At this point in the day,

13:28.308 --> 13:29.538
Conley's team
has to be surprised...

13:33.112 --> 13:35.182
Someone's at the door!

13:36.849 --> 13:38.179
(doorbell rings)

13:39.819 --> 13:40.919
Russo?

13:42.555 --> 13:43.885
(sighs)

13:47.159 --> 13:50.199
Madeline, the HOA meeting
is about to start.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.897
(sighs)

13:53.499 --> 13:54.969
Ross?

13:54.968 --> 13:56.268
You coming?

13:57.837 --> 13:58.937
Ross!

14:00.606 --> 14:02.106
You okay?

14:03.275 --> 14:04.875
If you're standing right here,

14:04.878 --> 14:07.448
paying your respects,

14:07.447 --> 14:08.577
you'd look up...

14:11.083 --> 14:14.153
...and you'd see
the cherry blossoms.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.361
I think I know who Dara is.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.206
PHYLLIS: However,
I know your family

14:39.212 --> 14:40.452
has been through a series
of crises lately.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.307
It would be unfair
for us to judge you

14:43.316 --> 14:45.176
without hearing your
side of the story.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.275
Come on.

14:47.519 --> 14:50.619
You want me to go with you?

14:50.624 --> 14:53.524
I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.586
That's a hard no.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.903
There you are.

15:04.536 --> 15:06.366
Here I am.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.343
Did you get everything
you wanted?

15:10.175 --> 15:12.975
Well, I wanted my family.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.309
Cam and Jack. But...

15:15.315 --> 15:18.315
you ruined that for me.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.148
Turned Cam against me.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.488
You did that all by yourself.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.161
Mm...

15:26.159 --> 15:27.429
No.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.959
You know, parents have
such a big influence

15:32.966 --> 15:34.266
on their children.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.627
I know
my father had

15:36.636 --> 15:38.666
a huge impact on me.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.338
Do you know who my father was,

15:44.344 --> 15:46.014
Madeline?

15:46.012 --> 15:47.282
No.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.380
No.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.382
He was an artist, too.

15:53.386 --> 15:57.386
Very... avant-garde.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.720
Very controversial.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.103
And I helped him.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.269
That's sweet.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.598
Russo!

16:10.603 --> 16:12.543
He's not coming.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.339
(gasps)

16:26.585 --> 16:28.115
(inhales)

16:37.496 --> 16:38.726
Sophie...

16:38.732 --> 16:40.202
Not my name.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.670
Please don't do this.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.747
You know, when my father
came into this house,

16:53.747 --> 16:56.207
he was all I had left.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.716
My mom died
when I was ten.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.277
<i> I adored her.</i>

17:00.286 --> 17:04.786
And then... I lost her.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.161
You know what that's like?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.359
That kind of loss?

17:09.362 --> 17:11.102
The kind that...

17:11.097 --> 17:13.027
rips your insides out?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.601
'Cause that was me and my dad.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.665
Because it shouldn't
have happened.

17:22.307 --> 17:24.537
We were in a car accident.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.814
She had two surgeries,

17:26.813 --> 17:29.053
five weeks in the hospital.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.279
First-class hospital,
supposedly.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.684
They hardly ever

17:32.685 --> 17:34.185
checked on her.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.817
My dad and I kept
telling the doctors

17:36.823 --> 17:39.163
and nurses
that something was wrong.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.829
You know, she was out of it.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.127
<i> Disoriented.</i>

17:47.199 --> 17:49.129
<i> But they said she was fine.</i>

17:49.135 --> 17:51.135
<i> No special tests</i>

17:51.137 --> 17:52.667
<i> or second opinions,</i>

17:52.672 --> 17:54.212
no.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.607
Not for us.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.713
They said it was just side
effects from the medication.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.817
It was septic shock.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.461
By the time
they figured it out,

18:14.461 --> 18:16.191
it was too far gone.
(grunting softly)

18:18.130 --> 18:19.460
The rich patients,

18:19.466 --> 18:22.566
the ones with money and...

18:22.569 --> 18:23.869
connections,
well,

18:23.870 --> 18:25.500
they were given
special tests,

18:25.505 --> 18:27.805
state-of-the-art equipment.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.637
Did you know those patients

18:29.642 --> 18:31.642
were actually given
special blue blankets

18:31.644 --> 18:33.544
so the staff knows
to treat them better?

18:36.515 --> 18:37.845
(chuckles softly)

18:39.885 --> 18:41.385
Of course you do.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.316
As we sat

18:46.326 --> 18:49.586
and watched
as she slipped away...

18:55.134 --> 18:58.304
...something in me

18:58.304 --> 19:00.714
cracked.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.837
<i> In my dad, too.</i>

19:07.846 --> 19:10.146
<i> So...</i>

19:10.150 --> 19:12.450
<i> we started a list.</i>

19:12.452 --> 19:15.152
There was an easy place
to start.

19:17.289 --> 19:20.359
The rich donors
who helped create that divide.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.430
¶ ¶

19:26.298 --> 19:28.298
<i> And so...</i>

19:28.301 --> 19:30.841
his mission began.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.868
Borrowed a car
from a family friend.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.914
Learned how to break
into big, lavish mansions.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.876
I was good at it;
I still am.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.494
(beeping)

19:49.488 --> 19:50.958
Hey.
(exhales)

19:50.957 --> 19:52.657
Geez!

19:52.659 --> 19:54.729
How the hell'd
you get in here?

19:57.663 --> 19:59.963
Your father took you with him
when he committed murder?

20:03.468 --> 20:06.538
You're not exactly in a position
to judge parenting skills.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.680
My father
went in first.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.637
Made sure
it was safe.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.650
<i> I'd stay in the car.</i>

20:20.319 --> 20:21.989
Wait for my signal

20:21.988 --> 20:23.518
and then come in.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.223
Okay.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.800
Then...

20:30.797 --> 20:31.957
when he was done,

20:31.965 --> 20:34.665
I'd help him clean up, help him

20:34.667 --> 20:35.927
set the scene,

20:35.935 --> 20:37.535
create the
tableau.

20:38.537 --> 20:41.537
And finally...

20:41.541 --> 20:43.841
place the bell.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.443
(bell tinkling)

20:46.446 --> 20:49.806
The one thing they could've used
to call for help with.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.716
Just out of reach.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.420
Like it was for us.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.520
(crying):
What do you want from me?

21:00.526 --> 21:01.856
I'll give you anything you want.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.331
Shut up!

21:03.329 --> 21:05.729
Shut... up.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.732
My father came
into this house,

21:07.734 --> 21:09.734
and he never left!

21:09.736 --> 21:12.636
I waited for the cops
to come find me.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.909
Or to hear my father's name
on the news,

21:14.907 --> 21:17.437
but nothing ever happened.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.913
Because you never called
the cops, did you?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.383
No.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.482
You used my father,

21:25.485 --> 21:26.975
his name,

21:26.986 --> 21:28.886
his signature,

21:28.888 --> 21:31.888
his legacy

21:31.891 --> 21:34.891
to get rid
of your own enemies.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.064
And suddenly...

21:37.063 --> 21:40.973
well, suddenly,
I was an orphan.

21:43.502 --> 21:46.502
And you know what?

21:46.506 --> 21:50.676
That same family friend

21:50.677 --> 21:52.037
took me in.

21:53.912 --> 21:56.812
(crying):
<i> I didn't want to kill her.</i>

21:56.816 --> 21:59.046
But...
(shuddering breath)

21:59.052 --> 22:01.652
the cops were getting too close.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.064
You know,
if they questioned her again,

22:04.057 --> 22:05.987
she may have slipped.

22:05.992 --> 22:10.092
She may have mentioned my name.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.596
So I tried to make it
as quick as possible,

22:12.598 --> 22:15.598
because she didn't deserve
to suffer.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.701
I can help you.

22:17.704 --> 22:18.944
Li-Listen to me.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.938
Shut up.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.540
I can help you.
Shut... up.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.883
Let me help you.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.608
You need money.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.383
I can give you that.
Oh.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.382
$500,000.
(scoffs)

22:32.385 --> 22:34.445
It's in Mitchell's
mausoleum space.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.394
Sophie,
untie me

22:36.389 --> 22:37.889
and I can give you the key!

22:37.890 --> 22:41.760
(door creaks open)

22:41.761 --> 22:45.401
APRIL: Strength comes
from doing what's...
Just grabbing something

22:45.398 --> 22:47.398
for Jack, Mom. Just
pretend I'm not here.
(muffled screaming)

22:47.400 --> 22:49.830
Be in and out in a second.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.548
He misses me, doesn't he?

23:02.548 --> 23:05.148
What are you doing here?

23:05.151 --> 23:07.491
Whoa!
(grunts)

23:07.487 --> 23:10.387
Who the hell
is that?
I didn't want you to know.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.860
Sophie, what are you doing?

23:12.859 --> 23:13.889
I have to finish.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.963
Finish what?!

23:15.962 --> 23:18.802
What my father started.

23:20.665 --> 23:23.465
You.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.839
It's you.
(grunts)

23:25.838 --> 23:30.068
(grunts)
You were just supposed to be
my way into the family, Cam.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.036
You know, before I knew
who she was,

23:32.044 --> 23:35.114
I kept seeing her around
at different places.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.154
Coffee shop,

23:37.150 --> 23:38.680
movies.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.184
And then this one
day in the park...

23:40.186 --> 23:42.086
ALISON: When she just popped up
in front of you

23:42.088 --> 23:44.188
and...
And said, "Hi, I'm Sophie,

23:44.190 --> 23:46.420
and I'm gonna be
your girlfriend."

23:46.426 --> 23:48.486
She was right.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.134
Then I fell in love.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.531
<i> And we had this unique,</i>
<i> amazing child together.</i>

23:55.535 --> 23:58.465
And I wanted you more
than I wanted revenge.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.439
Could've stayed that way,
but you told me it was over.

24:04.444 --> 24:07.454
You told me I was
never gonna see my son again.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.107
Now all I have left is revenge.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.145
Sophie!

24:10.149 --> 24:11.849
No!

24:11.851 --> 24:14.521
Sophie!
(grunts)

24:14.520 --> 24:16.450
Sophie!

24:16.456 --> 24:20.116
(breathing deeply)

24:20.126 --> 24:22.026
(strained grunting)

24:22.028 --> 24:23.828
Come on, buddy.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.630
(grunts, groans)

24:25.631 --> 24:28.701
(panting)

24:36.641 --> 24:39.541
(grunting)

24:41.780 --> 24:43.850
(panting)

24:47.619 --> 24:49.949
(groans)

24:49.956 --> 24:52.216
(panting)

24:56.061 --> 24:58.061
(grunting)

24:58.064 --> 25:00.004
TESSA:
<i> This is getting exciting.</i>

24:59.999 --> 25:03.029
Naomi says it's neck and neck.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.535
(chuckles)

25:04.537 --> 25:06.937
Hey, uh...

25:06.939 --> 25:08.569
I just saw Christina.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.244
Oh, yeah?

25:10.243 --> 25:13.043
Yeah. Um...

25:13.045 --> 25:15.905
she's got a new job
in-in San Francisco,

25:15.915 --> 25:18.575
and... she wants me to go.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.624
Oh, wow.
(phone ringing)

25:21.621 --> 25:22.991
Your phone is ringing.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.189
Oh.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.961
Hey.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.259
BRADY: Tess, I've been trying
to reach you.

25:28.261 --> 25:29.591
Have you seen Sophie?

25:29.595 --> 25:30.725
She anywhere
near you?

25:30.730 --> 25:32.260
What? No, Sophie's not here.

25:32.265 --> 25:34.265
Why?
It's her, Tess.

25:34.267 --> 25:35.597
She's SBK's daughter.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.001
She's the accomplice.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.603
That can't be right, Brady.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.944
I mean, yeah,
I'm-I'm with Alison and Garrett

25:41.941 --> 25:44.171
and guards and cops
and hundreds of other...

25:44.176 --> 25:45.836
Cam.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.845
Cam went back to the house
to get something for Jack.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.678
Will you check in with the cop
assigned to the Hawthorne house?

25:52.117 --> 25:53.647
He's been gone a while.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.093
And Mom is there, too.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.787
OFFICER:
I'm at the station.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.260
Why the hell aren't you
at the Hawthorne house?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.758
Detail was lifted at the request
of the homeowner.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.331
(sighs)

26:03.329 --> 26:04.999
Okay, Tess, listen to me,

26:04.997 --> 26:06.927
I need you to stay put.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.673
I'm gonna go check on Cam
and your mom.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.938
Okay.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.637
Tess, you okay?

26:16.174 --> 26:18.014
It's Sophie.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.210
Sophie is the accomplice.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.252
Brady's going to the
house to check on Cam.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.978
And Mom.

26:27.018 --> 26:28.048
I'm going.

26:28.054 --> 26:31.094
Wait, Brady said to stay...

26:31.090 --> 26:32.290
Excuse me.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.732
Cam? Cam!

26:36.729 --> 26:38.699
He can't help you.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.837
(grunting)

27:03.855 --> 27:06.055
You know,
you're right.

27:06.058 --> 27:09.058
We treated you unfairly.

27:09.061 --> 27:12.731
So-so let me fix it.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.232
You want Jack?

27:14.233 --> 27:16.903
I can make that
happen.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.172
I can call the lawyers.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.340
Right now.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.868
Retract everything.

27:22.907 --> 27:25.077
(Cam continues grunting)

27:39.190 --> 27:41.930
I can speak
to the judge myself.

27:41.927 --> 27:45.197
I can tell him that...

27:45.197 --> 27:47.257
Jack needs you in his life.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.404
Not just supervised visits.

27:51.404 --> 27:52.874
Shared custody.

27:52.872 --> 27:57.272
I can say whatever
you want me to.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.106
You'd do that?

28:01.913 --> 28:03.253
Yes.

28:09.921 --> 28:11.421
(chuckles softly)

28:11.424 --> 28:13.094
Yeah, right.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.032
(gasps, groans)

28:21.299 --> 28:23.369
(grunting)

28:27.205 --> 28:29.405
(thud in distance)

28:29.408 --> 28:32.008
(gasps, panting)

28:35.113 --> 28:37.383
I'm sorry, buddy.

28:39.317 --> 28:41.347
(grunting)

28:48.159 --> 28:49.359
(coughs)

28:49.361 --> 28:52.431
(grunting)

28:52.431 --> 28:55.101
(panting)

28:56.501 --> 28:58.241
(grunts)
Sophie!

28:58.237 --> 29:00.367
You're too late.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.342
(panting)

29:14.953 --> 29:17.223
How could you?

29:17.223 --> 29:20.023
She was poison, Cam.

29:20.025 --> 29:22.085
(shuddering breaths)

29:26.232 --> 29:29.472
I'm not gonna hurt
anyone else.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.998
I promise you,
I'm leaving town.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.003
You'll never see me again.

29:32.004 --> 29:36.344
I let you into our family.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.942
I have to
stop you.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.343
GARRETT:
Don't do it, Cam.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.808
Don't do it.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.281
Cam, listen
to me.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.415
I've lived with someone's blood
on my hands for a long time.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.290
You don't
want that.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.359
I don't care.
It'll eat at you.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.418
It'll haunt you.

29:54.426 --> 29:57.856
Little brother, I don't want
you to have to live that way.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.833
Listen to him, Cam.
Shut up!

29:59.832 --> 30:01.172
Shut up!
I don't...

30:01.167 --> 30:03.127
Okay, okay,
but think.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.265
You're gonna go to prison.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.140
What's gonna happen to Jack?

30:06.138 --> 30:09.908
Jack deserves better than us.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.940
(grunts)

30:15.413 --> 30:18.083
(officers shouting)

30:20.385 --> 30:22.945
She was just here.
She went that way.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.185
LINDA:
Go! Find her!

30:24.190 --> 30:25.590
Find her! Go,
go, go, go, go!

30:25.591 --> 30:28.961
(officers shouting)

30:48.847 --> 30:50.477
It means so much
that you're here. Really,

30:50.482 --> 30:51.522
it was such
a generous contribution.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.377
Excuse me.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.985
What?
I can't believe it.

30:54.987 --> 30:58.317
I just got a heads-up
from my friend at WXQN.

30:58.324 --> 30:59.924
They're about to
call the election.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.055
Our play for the
union worked; you won.

31:02.061 --> 31:05.131
You are the new
mayor of Boston.
(gasps)

31:05.130 --> 31:07.330
With 98% of the vote
now counted,

31:07.333 --> 31:10.573
we can call the race for mayor
here in Boston.

31:10.569 --> 31:13.099
Challenger
Alison Hawthorne-Price

31:13.105 --> 31:15.505
has won
the incredibly close race.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.337
(cheering and applause)

31:18.344 --> 31:20.014
This is because of you.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.512
I just helped
everyone see the truth.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.154
You deserve it.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.323
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:28.320 --> 31:31.150
I would like
to introduce to you

31:31.156 --> 31:32.456
the mayor of Boston,

31:32.458 --> 31:35.328
Alison Hawthorne-Price!

31:35.327 --> 31:37.957
(cheering and applause)

31:37.963 --> 31:40.033
¶ ¶

32:10.061 --> 32:12.131
¶ ¶

32:22.540 --> 32:24.610
(indistinct radio chatter)

32:53.972 --> 32:56.042
¶ ¶

33:16.995 --> 33:19.755
(siren wailing in distance)

33:35.279 --> 33:37.749
¶ ¶

33:37.750 --> 33:40.450
(indistinct police transmission)

33:45.556 --> 33:46.656
I missed it.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.587
How did I miss it? How?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.056
I mean, I...

33:52.064 --> 33:54.204
I've known her...

33:54.199 --> 33:57.229
I've known her for years.

33:57.236 --> 34:01.266
Come on. No one sees
their own family clearly.

34:02.473 --> 34:04.313
Hey, now we know
what she looks like.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.309
Next time she shows
her face in public,

34:06.311 --> 34:08.150
we'll get her,
thanks to you.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.777
Yeah, but she's still out there.

34:09.782 --> 34:11.522
(sighs)

34:11.516 --> 34:15.117
17 years this thing
went unsolved.

34:15.120 --> 34:20.120
But your incredibly
annoying persistence

34:20.125 --> 34:24.355
and pathological inability
to let anything go,

34:24.362 --> 34:26.663
that's what finally
got us answers.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.829
Touché.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.666
Again with
the French.

34:45.349 --> 34:46.719
Recording of you and Conley.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.447
Only copy.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.685
You sure?

34:52.690 --> 34:55.231
You could hold this
over my head forever.

34:56.627 --> 34:58.127
Yeah, but...

35:00.698 --> 35:02.768
...couldn't do that
to my partner.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.278
(sighs) You know what?
This whole time,

35:12.277 --> 35:15.277
I was worried that Jack
had psychopathic genes,

35:15.280 --> 35:18.120
that his grandfather was SBK.

35:18.117 --> 35:20.247
I mean...
I mean, he was.

35:20.252 --> 35:23.422
It was his other
grandfather.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.722
Jack'll be okay.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.291
He's got you.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.363
He's got all of us.
He'll be okay.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.433
You're sticking around?

35:34.433 --> 35:36.173
What about Christina?

35:36.168 --> 35:38.198
What about
San Francisco?

35:38.203 --> 35:40.543
I can't leave you guys.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.673
Yes, you can.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.607
You have to.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.653
No, I've got
five years' probation.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.748
They're not even gonna
let me out of the state.

35:53.851 --> 35:57.691
They would if the mayor talks
to your probation officer.

36:01.692 --> 36:04.462
Promise us that you'll go.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.503
Be happy.

36:16.707 --> 36:18.777
¶ ¶

36:21.612 --> 36:23.612
Well, I guess she likes beets.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.445
(chuckles)
Hard to say.

36:25.450 --> 36:26.920
I don't know if she got
any in her mouth.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.749
(chuckles)
Hey, my baby.

36:28.754 --> 36:31.254
What did you think?
(chuckling)

36:31.256 --> 36:32.486
Good girl, Mia.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.261
(phone rings)

36:35.260 --> 36:36.830
Hey!

36:36.828 --> 36:39.458
Yes, can't wait.
Is your flight on time?

36:39.464 --> 36:42.704
Great.
I'll let Cam know, too. Bye!

36:42.701 --> 36:44.301
Okay, we'll see you there.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.803
Okay, bye.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.236
Noon.

36:52.243 --> 36:55.213
It's officially
been one year.

36:57.515 --> 36:58.815
Wow.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.847
We made it.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.693
Now, I-I don't know

37:03.689 --> 37:06.259
if we need to rush
into anything.

37:07.358 --> 37:08.888
You know.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.398
(April laughs)

37:15.400 --> 37:16.670
Do you see Dana?

37:16.668 --> 37:17.828
You see her up there?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.696
Say hi. Hey.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.835
Say, "Hey, Dana."
(laughing): Yeah.

SOPHIE (recorded):
Don't worry,
I'll see you again soon.

39:05.042 --> 39:07.942
Don't worry,
I'll see you again soon.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.646
Don't worry, I'll see you
again soon.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.645
(sniffles)

39:15.654 --> 39:16.994
When?

39:21.959 --> 39:23.429
REPORTER:
<i> Here we are,</i>

39:23.428 --> 39:25.428
a year into your first term.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.000
Which most would call
a resounding success.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.599
You've implemented

39:29.601 --> 39:31.001
an effective gun
buyback program,

39:31.002 --> 39:32.642
increased funding
for arts and music,

39:32.637 --> 39:34.967
and stoked the
local economy.

39:34.973 --> 39:38.383
What's the secret for coming out
of the gate so strong?

39:39.677 --> 39:41.637
Well, I'm thorough to a fault.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.076
I pay attention.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.121
It's trite but true--

39:45.117 --> 39:46.977
the devil's in the details.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.045
¶ ¶

39:57.495 --> 39:59.855
Doesn't seem like
your husband's type.

40:06.137 --> 40:09.537
¶ ¶

40:14.845 --> 40:16.575
ALISON:
<i> I know it's you.</i>

40:16.581 --> 40:19.121
You're the accomplice.

40:22.486 --> 40:25.586
The wallpaper
in your self-portraits?

40:25.590 --> 40:28.530
It's from
the blind lady's house.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.127
You must have known her
pretty well.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.958
Well enough to get her
to cover for you and your dad.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.965
Well enough to bring over

40:35.967 --> 40:38.437
a program
from my father's funeral.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.074
It all adds up.

40:43.074 --> 40:44.974
Of course,

40:44.976 --> 40:47.136
you haven't been
without your detractors.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.875
True.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.880
But I've learned
to turn an adversary

40:50.882 --> 40:52.822
into an ally.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.964
If I go to the police,

41:04.963 --> 41:07.103
you'll spend your life
in prison.

41:10.601 --> 41:12.241
I know what happened

41:12.237 --> 41:14.737
the night your father
came into our house.

41:17.541 --> 41:20.681
You don't need
to target all of us.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.679
Just my mother.

41:22.681 --> 41:26.151
She orchestrated
everything.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.851
The cover-up
of your father's death,

41:28.854 --> 41:31.994
killing David Morales
and Jennifer Windham...

41:31.990 --> 41:33.220
You want revenge.

41:35.693 --> 41:38.963
And you want to remove
a liability.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.134
Protect the rest of your family.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.097
So you see the elegance
of this solution.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.750
Much has been made

41:57.749 --> 42:00.079
of your family's involvement
in the Silver Bells case.

42:00.085 --> 42:03.885
Your mother's killer
is still at large.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.289
How do you cope with that?

42:05.290 --> 42:08.560
I learned from my mother

42:08.560 --> 42:11.060
that you can choose
to live in fear

42:11.062 --> 42:13.662
or you can move forward.

42:13.665 --> 42:16.925
You can be a victim
of your circumstances

42:16.935 --> 42:20.565
or you can summon the strength
to push through no matter what.

42:21.572 --> 42:23.872
Today, our family
is thriving.

42:27.044 --> 42:32.684
I think my mother
would be proud.
