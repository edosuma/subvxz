He's been staying

00:04.755 --> 00:07.090
with us over the summer,
interning at the record label.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.050
And I've just decided
to stay the year.

00:09.092 --> 00:12.179
Is it just me, or is our
sexual tension palpable?

00:12.220 --> 00:14.723
You don't have the gift.
You see this? I've got ten songs

00:57.474 --> 01:00.185

have access

01:21.832 --> 01:23.375

01:25.084 --> 01:26.253

01:26.294 --> 01:28.255

back the date

01:28.296 --> 01:30.131

10:09.984 --> 10:11.486
Hi.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.571
Gossip, please.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.114
What?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.116
It can even be about people
I don't know.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.742
Anything to get my mind off
the fact

10:17.784 --> 10:19.244
that Laurel still hasn't called
me back.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.580
Hey, I'm sure she's gonna
love your song.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.497
NAOMI:
Hey, you!

10:23.831 --> 10:26.000
Hey, Ade,
let me call you back, okay?

10:26.042 --> 10:27.752
Okay. Bye.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.298
Are you kidding me?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.382
"Hey, you"?

10:32.424 --> 10:33.674
So, it's true.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.635
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.804
When Annie said I needed
to apologize for hitting

10:37.845 --> 10:39.639
on Teddy,
I thought she was trying

10:39.680 --> 10:42.517
to make some kind of bad joke.
It wasn't a bad joke, was it?

10:42.559 --> 10:45.145
Are you actually implying
that you don't remember?

10:45.186 --> 10:46.980
Look, I know this might
sound crazy,

10:47.021 --> 10:48.773
but I think someone might have
put something

10:48.815 --> 10:49.857
in my drink that night.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.651
What are you talking about?

10:51.692 --> 10:53.445
I remember the beginning
of the party.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.780
I remember when Teddy got there,
and we toasted.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.198
And I was watching
people dance.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.367
And then this guy
came up to me and he

10:59.409 --> 11:01.869
said he was from
Carver Westhall or something.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.746
He had reddish-brown hair,
plaid shirt.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.165
Did you see him?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.167
Anyway, he asked me
if I wanted a drink,

11:07.208 --> 11:09.169
and I said sure,
and he brought me one.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.338
And I remember thinking
that it tasted funny,

11:11.379 --> 11:14.841
and after that, I don't
remember anything at all.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.343
Not even stripping?

11:16.384 --> 11:19.179
What?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.680
Oh, my God, I feel sick.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.976
Listen, Silver,
I don't know what to say,

11:25.018 --> 11:26.645
except that you know me.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.855
Okay?

11:28.896 --> 11:32.609
I would never hit on Teddy,
not in my right mind.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.404
I mean, it was kind
of out of nowhere.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.074
Are you okay?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.243
I guess it's just better
that I don't remember

11:42.285 --> 11:45.704
anything from that
night, you know?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.123
Yeah.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.047
I'd like to help,
but I'm not permitted

11:54.088 --> 11:55.632
to give the location
of a student.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.884
I'm sorry.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.760
Can I write a note, or...?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.101
OSCAR:
Dixon.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.396
Dixon, hey.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.356
Listen, I feel like

12:11.398 --> 12:13.316
we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.068
You and Ivy were
apart all summer,

12:15.109 --> 12:17.736
and her first day back, I
completely monopolized her.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.531
It was thoughtless,
unconscionable.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.948
No, listen, it's-it's
all good, all right?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.409
I was just in a bad mood.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.868
Well, you had every
reason to be.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.120
I was a third wheel, and
a squeaky one at that.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.331
It's just, I don't know
anyone except Ivy.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.083
So... it's fine.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.835
I'm sure I'll find
some mates, eventually.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.087
Hey.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.922
Why don't I introduce you
to my friends?

12:35.963 --> 12:37.924
Really?
Yeah.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.133
Yeah, that would be
brilliant.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.051
(chuckles)

12:46.349 --> 12:47.308
Hi.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.602
Hey.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.521
Um, I'm going to be working on
my documentary later--

12:51.563 --> 12:53.898
taking advantage of West Bev's
incredible equipment--

12:53.940 --> 12:56.109
and I thought
you might like to sit in.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.944
You know, learn a little
about the editing process.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.779
Uh, yes, I'd love
to, but I can't.

13:00.821 --> 13:04.075
It's Naomi's 18th
birthday party tonight.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.076
Oh.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.827
I didn't know
you two were friends.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.329
(clears throat)

13:08.371 --> 13:11.124
Yeah, look, I know she
made a mistake last year,

13:11.165 --> 13:12.626
but she's actually
a good person...

13:12.667 --> 13:13.627
No. She's not.

13:13.668 --> 13:14.628
She's a liar.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.795
And she almost
destroyed my life.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.798
Who knows what she'll
do, now that...

13:19.840 --> 13:20.799
I shouldn't say anymore.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.135
Just, um...

13:22.176 --> 13:24.387
have fun at
the birthday party.

13:31.852 --> 13:35.064
JEN: It was a total debacle
at the lawyers! I mean, really!

13:35.106 --> 13:36.483
How hard is it to put together

13:36.524 --> 13:37.734
an effective
PowerPoint presentation?

13:37.776 --> 13:39.026
I'm sorry.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.320
Oh, you're sorry?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.571
You are sorry.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.783
You're a sorry excuse
for an assistant.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.661
Am I paying

13:47.702 --> 13:49.621
you people to
stare at me?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.122
Go get me a glass of water.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.167
And do not make eye contact
with me for the rest of the day.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.168
Thank you.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.877
Oh, perfect.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.087
Jen, we have to talk.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.380
Ryan, you say that a lot.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.382
Look, I have the
paternity papers,

14:01.424 --> 14:03.884
and I'd like you
to sign them.
I'm not signing anything.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.346
Allison, where is the
updated inventory?!

14:06.387 --> 14:08.097
Jen, you can't
avoid this forever.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.516
Look, I have had a
really bad day,

14:09.557 --> 14:10.975
and I am not
in the mood.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.352
Yeah, well, you're never
in the mood, okay?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.395
You don't return
my phone calls, my e-mails...

14:14.437 --> 14:17.023
Ryan, I am not
feeling well.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.358
Okay?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.777
I have a bad stomachache,
and I'm not...

14:20.819 --> 14:21.986
(panting)

14:22.028 --> 14:24.280
Just one thing after another
with you, isn't it?

14:24.322 --> 14:25.406
There's no more
excuses, okay?

14:25.448 --> 14:28.242
I'm not leaving
until you sign these.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.036
What's wrong?

14:30.077 --> 14:31.037
I don't know.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.205
You're not going
into labor...?

14:32.246 --> 14:33.707
No, I'm not going
into labor, okay?!

14:33.748 --> 14:34.708
I'm not due for

14:34.749 --> 14:35.916
another two months.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.085
I'm sure it's noth-- ah!

14:38.127 --> 14:39.086
Ah, was that a contraction?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.756
How the hell am I
supposed to know?!

14:41.798 --> 14:42.757
(gasps):
Oh.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.800
Oh, God.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.760
(panting)

14:45.802 --> 14:47.303
Jen?

14:50.139 --> 14:52.392
Ryan, I can't be going
into labor right now, okay?

14:52.433 --> 14:53.560
It's...

14:53.601 --> 14:55.311
(gasps)
It's too soon.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.567
I can't believe it.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.903
I mean, that's her.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.530
That's our baby.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.407
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's a miracle.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.949
Uh, look, can we
wrap this up?

15:08.991 --> 15:10.577
I have things to do.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.829
Well, I hope they're things
you can do from bed, because

15:12.871 --> 15:14.997
that's where you're going to be
for the next two months.

15:15.039 --> 15:15.998
What?!

15:16.040 --> 15:17.208
W-Why?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.085
You said that
my contractions have stopped.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.545
They did.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.255
But your placenta
has started to separate

15:22.296 --> 15:23.673
from your uterus.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.425
So, if you want
to carry this baby to term,

15:25.466 --> 15:27.009
you're going to have
to stay off your feet.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.010
(chuckles)

15:28.052 --> 15:29.011
Jen, this is serious.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.012
No, we understand.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.473
I... understand.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.770
My assistant
will pick me up.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.938
Thank you for the
ride to the hospital.
Sure.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.691
I think your cheap upholstery
in your car gave me a rash,

15:41.733 --> 15:44.026
but, well,
you got me here, so...

15:44.068 --> 15:46.195
that's something.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.618
Okay.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.619
Bye.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.037
Yep.

15:56.997 --> 16:01.586
One for you, one for you, better
luck next year, one for you.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.838
Hmm, show me your abs.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.089
Ah.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.592
The rest of you should
lay off the Ho Hos.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.843
All right...

16:08.885 --> 16:10.428
Hey, uh, Naomi, I
got to talk to you.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.306
Ladies, make sure
not to wear metallic,

16:13.347 --> 16:14.724
as the queen will be
wearing gold.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.725
What is it, Liam?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.727
Hey, we're good, right?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.854
Well, I just turned 18
and inherited a fortune.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.856
I'm amazing. I don't
really know how you are.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.358
No, come on, I mean...

16:24.400 --> 16:26.152
I'm serious, Naomi.
W-We're cool?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.154
We-We're friends? No weirdness?

16:28.195 --> 16:31.491
You're, uh...
over me and all that?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.033
(chuckles) Please. I haven't
thought of you in months.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.789
Good. So you wouldn't mind
if I were to date someone else?

16:37.831 --> 16:38.998
I couldn't care less.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.251
Even if it's, like...
like a friend of yours?

16:45.212 --> 16:47.715
Are you talking
about Annie?

16:50.134 --> 16:51.761
Yes.

16:51.803 --> 16:52.887
But she wouldn't do anything

16:52.929 --> 16:54.889
because she's friends
with you, and I know

16:54.931 --> 16:57.183
that you guys have
the-the girl thing...

16:57.224 --> 16:59.811
Naomi, wait. Where
you going? Wait.

17:03.564 --> 17:07.108
I just want you to know
that I am totally over Liam.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.109
If you want to

17:08.152 --> 17:10.237
go for it,
go for it.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.656
I'm serious.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.532
I wouldn't care if you did it
right in front of me.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.242
Well, actually I would, 'cause
that'd be really nasty to watch,

17:15.284 --> 17:17.744
but I wouldn't care
that it was Liam that you were

17:17.787 --> 17:18.872
doing it with.

17:18.913 --> 17:19.873
Capisce?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.457
Capisce.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.541
(gasps)

17:22.583 --> 17:23.584
What is that heifer

17:23.626 --> 17:24.502
doing with my invite?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.424
So?

17:30.466 --> 17:33.469
Can I finally
take you on a date?

17:36.263 --> 17:37.891
JEN:
Okay, while I'm
on bed rest,

17:37.932 --> 17:39.225
I am going to need
your attention

17:39.266 --> 17:40.810
24 hours a day,
eight days a week.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.979
Okay, screw-ups will no
longer be tolerated,

17:43.021 --> 17:46.482
as it is imperative that
I stay calm and placated.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.985
When I say "Jump,"
you say "How high?"

17:49.027 --> 17:53.447
When I say "I need a manicure,"
you say "Round or square?"

17:53.489 --> 17:55.115
You got it?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.116
I quit.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.411
You can't quit.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.412
How dare you.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.997
Know what--
get back here!

18:01.956 --> 18:03.123
You know what?!

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
You're fired!

18:05.167 --> 18:07.127
Let me get the first round.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.005
No, dude, you must have
thrown down 100 bucks

18:09.047 --> 18:10.256
paying off the
guy at the door.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.340
It was my pleasure.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.508
Four?
Ah, count me out.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.509
Yeah.
I'm not drinking.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.427
Thank you.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.264
Hey, um, thank you, guys,
for doing this.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.265
You know, I figure,

18:19.306 --> 18:20.307
the more people
Oscar knows,

18:20.349 --> 18:23.061
the less he'll hang out
with me and Ivy.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.103
(British accent):
Our pleasure.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.606
He seems like a
bloody good chap.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.941
Dude, seriously,
please, no accent.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.149
How 'bout a wee one?

18:29.191 --> 18:30.777
I'm about to kick you
in your wee one.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.779
Dude, I'm just trying to
make him feel at home.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.655
DIXON:
Make him feel at...?

18:34.697 --> 18:35.531
Navid.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.816
Listen. The only
reason I lied

28:54.858 --> 28:56.776
is because I didn't want
to upset you,

28:56.818 --> 28:58.445
because of your mom and stuff.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.280
You want to know the worst thing

29:00.322 --> 29:01.865
about growing up
with an alcoholic?

29:01.907 --> 29:03.992
When she would look me
in the eye

29:04.034 --> 29:05.661
and swear she wasn't drunk.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.959
Wow.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.337
I didn't think parties
like this even existed.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.214
Don't you watch
My Super Sweet 16?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.633
On MTV?

29:19.675 --> 29:21.176
I read.
Ah. Snob.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.178
Hey, I'm proud of it.
(laughs)

29:23.220 --> 29:25.180
So, are you horrified
that I took you here?

29:25.222 --> 29:26.432
Are you kidding? No.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.518
I mean, snobs like to have fun
while we quietly judge.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.395
Oh. Judge, huh?

29:31.437 --> 29:33.355
Quietly, yeah.

29:33.397 --> 29:34.940
So, let's hear the judgments.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.735
Huh.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.654
Youth and excess.

29:40.696 --> 29:42.906
Conspicuous consumption.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.991
You can't just look
at this as a birthday party.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.911
You kind of got to look at it
like a moment in time.

29:47.953 --> 29:51.039
Ah. A moment
that a, uh, talented writer

29:51.081 --> 29:52.708
with a keen eye,

29:52.750 --> 29:55.377
grand literary ambitions
and a pretty cool blazer

29:55.419 --> 29:57.379
could turn into a stinging
social commentary?

29:57.421 --> 29:58.505
Something like that.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.839
(laughs)
Well, you're cute.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.216
For a snob.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.218
No, it's just
this really cool blazer.

30:03.260 --> 30:06.096
(chuckles) And the fact
that you actually talk.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.056
Oh, Mr. Unresolved
wasn't a talker?

30:08.098 --> 30:09.891
No, Mr. Resolved,

30:09.933 --> 30:12.686
uh, was more
of a grunter.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.895
ADRIANNA:
Hey, uh, did you hear

30:13.937 --> 30:15.814
what happened
between Silver and Naomi?

30:19.610 --> 30:22.154
(door opening)

30:22.195 --> 30:24.948
Does the offer to watch
you edit still stand?

30:26.908 --> 30:28.452
Is everything all right?

30:30.120 --> 30:31.455
(mutters softly)

30:31.497 --> 30:33.248
Come sit down.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.632
What happened?

30:41.674 --> 30:43.801
Stuff with Naomi.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.803
And my boyfriend.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.346
Or ex-boyfriend.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.930
I don't even know anymore.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.808
He's been such
a jerk lately,

30:50.849 --> 30:54.060
and-and part of me feels like
I should just be okay with it

30:54.102 --> 30:55.771
because he's going
through such a hard time.

30:55.813 --> 30:57.147
Just because
someone's going

30:57.189 --> 30:59.399
through a hard time doesn't mean
they can mistreat you.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.485
I know.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.195
I'm serious.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.573
You don't deserve it.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.618
You're kind and smart
and great.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.537
Did I already
say "great"?

31:12.705 --> 31:15.415
And, uh, if he can't see that,

31:15.457 --> 31:18.210
then he doesn't deserve
to be your boyfriend.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.673
(indistinct chatter)

31:22.715 --> 31:24.633
(laughing)
You know what I'm saying?

31:24.675 --> 31:26.635
Let's grab a
drink. Come on.

31:29.513 --> 31:30.639
Can we talk to you?

31:30.681 --> 31:32.683
Ugh. You have terrible timing.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.810
Adrian was just
giving me the eye.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.603
Why would you hit on Teddy
and lie about it?

31:36.645 --> 31:38.980
You know, I'm trying
to enjoy my party, all right?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.858
What were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.651
But why would you do it?
I don't know.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.611
Well, there has to be a reason.
There isn't.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.780
ADRIANNA:
What is wrong with you!
Please! Okay?

31:46.822 --> 31:48.824
You-you were a drug addict
who got pregnant

31:48.866 --> 31:50.659
and didn't even know
who the father was.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.035
Come on, you're
judging me, really?

31:52.077 --> 31:54.162
Well, this is not about Ade.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.163
Okay, stop acting
like Pollyanna.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.289
You freaking killed a guy.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.709
Screw you, Naomi.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.293
(partygoers cheering)

32:00.335 --> 32:01.545
ANNIE:
Where is Silver?

32:01.587 --> 32:03.171
Can we please get out
of here now?

32:03.213 --> 32:05.674
(groans) She's already taken off
to work with Mr. Cannon.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.843
Wh... What?

32:07.885 --> 32:09.845
Why is Silver
with Mr. Cannon?

32:09.887 --> 32:11.680
Because he's her advisor.

32:11.722 --> 32:14.182
They're editing.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.101
(sighs)

32:28.029 --> 32:30.282
What's going on?

32:30.323 --> 32:32.158
Well, um...

32:32.200 --> 32:36.413
I made a few simple demands,
and, uh, Allison walked out.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.664
So, now,
apparently, I have

32:37.706 --> 32:39.792
a-a bad reputation

32:39.833 --> 32:42.252
in the personal assistants
community because...

32:42.294 --> 32:45.839
I can't get anyone
to work for me.

32:45.881 --> 32:49.008
(sighs)
Hence, um... you.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.678
So, I'm going
to need a, um,

32:51.720 --> 32:53.639
sparkling lemonade,

32:53.680 --> 32:56.099
a new cell phone,
French Vogue...

32:56.141 --> 32:59.227
Yeah, you mean...
you're all alone.

33:00.687 --> 33:04.608
Um... I, uh, can't
even force my sister

33:04.650 --> 33:07.945
to take care of me, because
she's got her money back.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.279
So...

33:09.321 --> 33:12.198
there's nothing I can hold
over her head anymore.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.867
Well, I'd be happy
to help, Jen.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.536
Just as soon as

33:16.578 --> 33:17.996
you sign these.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.998
Ryan, it's
emotional blackmail.

33:20.039 --> 33:20.916
Regardless.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.007
(sighs)

33:31.009 --> 33:33.136
Great. So then I'll just
move in with you.

33:33.178 --> 33:36.348
Move in...? Wait. No. I do not
want you to move in with me.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.016
Well, it's not about what you
want anymore, Jen.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.601
Okay? It's about what's
best for the baby.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.145
I mean, that's what being
a good parent is, you know?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.063
It's focusing on what's
right for your child.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.899
But I don't want you
to move in with me.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.400
What if something goes
wrong? I mean, what if

33:47.442 --> 33:50.028
you need something in the middle
of the night, or what if there's

33:50.069 --> 33:51.029
an emergency?

33:51.070 --> 33:52.698
(sighs)

33:52.739 --> 33:53.949
Fine.

33:56.618 --> 33:59.204
Look at us.
(chuckles)

33:59.245 --> 34:03.709
Two mature adults making
decisions together.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.752
Just like real parents.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.420
Oh, please.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.422
Don't make me vomit.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.424
That's nice.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.759
(sighs)

34:12.801 --> 34:14.636
(cell phone ringing)

34:18.431 --> 34:20.350
Laurel, hi.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.436
You are in big trouble.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.815
Why have you been
holding out on me?

34:27.858 --> 34:30.902
That new song is unbelievable.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.530
(whispers):
What's she saying?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.697
Really, you liked it?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.699
More than liked, babe.

34:36.742 --> 34:37.951
Loved.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.369
And I...

34:39.411 --> 34:42.080
I'd like you to sing it
at Javier's memorial.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.049
(text message alert)

34:59.138 --> 35:00.098
Is everything all right?

35:00.139 --> 35:03.852
Yeah, it's just
a text from Naomi.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.103
I don't know what
her problem is.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.856
Yeah, well, um, she's
a very troubled girl.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.445
You know, I wasn't-- I wasn't
going to tell you this,

35:13.486 --> 35:14.613
but maybe I should.

35:17.950 --> 35:21.160
After Naomi lied about
the sexual harassment,

35:21.202 --> 35:25.624
she became somewhat...
infatuated with me.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.293
Obsessed, really.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.430
You okay?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.348
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.935
I just don't get
why guys have to act

35:44.977 --> 35:46.937
like such idiots sometimes.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.022
Look, however
out of control
things got,

35:49.064 --> 35:51.608
I'm sure it didn't
mean anything.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.402
You know, drunk people
just do stupid things.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.488
Trust me, I know.

35:56.529 --> 35:59.532
All right, my dad was
the king of stupidity.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.535
He was the life
of the party,

36:02.577 --> 36:05.914
sure, and he had
some grand parties--

36:05.956 --> 36:09.501
but you know, all I ever
wanted was a normal life.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.004
A mom, dad,

36:12.045 --> 36:15.214
white picket fence,
the whole thing.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.300
Sorry. I sound like a moron.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.802
No, no.
It...

36:18.844 --> 36:22.347
It's just that I-I-I kind of
felt that same way growing up.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.683
Really?
Yeah.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.353
I mean, I love
my mom, you know,

36:28.394 --> 36:30.188
but I just kind of...

36:30.229 --> 36:32.732
I don't know-- like
I hate her lifestyle.

36:32.774 --> 36:36.862
Sometimes I feel like
I grew up too fast.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.322
Did some things
before I was ready.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.033
Did you do that, too?

36:41.074 --> 36:43.326
No.

36:43.368 --> 36:48.206
No, I think I kind of went
in the other direction.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.418
You're still a virgin?

36:54.087 --> 36:55.672
No, don't--
don't be embarrassed.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.382
I envy you for that-- really.

36:57.423 --> 37:00.593
I mean, I lost my virginity
at the wrong time

37:00.635 --> 37:04.056
in the wrong place,
with the wrong girl.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.726
And I wish I could
do it over again.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.857
I...

37:13.899 --> 37:15.441
I should go.

37:28.287 --> 37:30.665
Okay, so here goes.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.130
Silver, I need
to talk to you.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.758
Uh... I don't
want to talk to you.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.259
Well, I'm not leaving
until you do.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.178
(chuckles)

37:43.220 --> 37:47.348
Okay, I'll be right back.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.941
(door closing)

37:55.982 --> 37:57.817
Look, you can't work
with Cannon.

37:57.859 --> 38:02.321
Why? Because you hit on him
and he rejected you?

38:02.363 --> 38:04.116
What?!
He told me everything.

38:04.157 --> 38:06.451
How you came on to him.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.120
How he turned you down.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.621
How you became obsessive...

38:09.662 --> 38:10.956
No.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.792
And after he shut you down,
you became crazy

38:13.833 --> 38:15.961
and vindictive.
That's not true.

38:16.002 --> 38:19.464
True? What do you know
about true?

38:19.505 --> 38:20.799
You've already proved
you're a liar.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.300
Not about this.

38:22.341 --> 38:25.303
Did you or did you not
try to run him over today?

38:25.344 --> 38:27.388
Yes, I did, but
that's because he...

38:27.430 --> 38:28.431
He what?

38:28.473 --> 38:29.474
He-- he...

38:29.515 --> 38:31.184
He rejected you?
No!

38:31.226 --> 38:33.812
Yes! And you've never
been rejected before.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.939
You just-- you can't accept it.
It's making you crazy.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.857
I mean, I guess that's
why you hit on Teddy.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.818
You got to make yourself
feel better somehow...

38:39.859 --> 38:43.362
Silver, no! This...
Cannon did not reject me!
That is not what this is!

38:43.404 --> 38:45.282
He-- he...
He what?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.325
What? What?
He raped me!

38:47.366 --> 38:50.162
It happened last year.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.788
And that's why I've
been so messed up.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.414
And I didn't think
I could tell you

38:53.456 --> 38:55.541
because it was too humiliating,
but I'm telling you now

38:55.583 --> 38:57.585
because you have
to stay away from him.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.340
Wow.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.510
I mean, you've done
