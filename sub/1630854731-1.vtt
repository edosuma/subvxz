00:02.359 --> 00:05.440
<i>In the beginning, there was The Boom.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:11.439
<i>Mankind used its science against itself,</i>

00:11.960 --> 00:15.679
<i>reducing the glittering towers
of glass and steel to dust.</i>

00:25.199 --> 00:26.559
My name is Sid.

00:27.559 --> 00:29.920
<i>I was born into a world with no past.</i>

00:30.800 --> 00:32.200
No future.

00:33.119 --> 00:35.399
Wandering the endless Wasteland.

00:36.759 --> 00:37.960
Alone.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.680
Hey, guys! Over here! Over here...

01:14.239 --> 01:15.359
Let's go!

01:36.120 --> 01:38.280
Must I do everything myself?

01:39.879 --> 01:41.280
Puny desert trash.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.519
No one escapes the wrath
of Freya Exaltada!

02:13.080 --> 02:16.919
- You're a tough little cockroach.
- And you're a psychotic bitch.

02:22.719 --> 02:24.400
I did not see that coming.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.479
Cute.

02:39.639 --> 02:41.000
Mazel tov!

02:45.400 --> 02:48.000
Are you sure about this?
I don't like the look of it.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.639
Oh, come on. What's so scary about
moving to the suburbs?

02:53.280 --> 02:54.639
Shall we?

03:07.400 --> 03:10.555
MIRACLE WORKERS

03:10.639 --> 03:15.840
END TIMES

03:17.280 --> 03:19.919
Freya, have you seen my tie?
I'm late for work.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.316
I've never had a 9:00 to 5:00 job before.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.515
Hey, we moved to Boomtown
to share a life together.

03:24.599 --> 03:26.876
I was on the road all the time
with my warlording,

03:26.960 --> 03:29.276
and you wanted to move out
of that cramped boulder

03:29.360 --> 03:30.955
you were hiding under like a crab.

03:31.039 --> 03:33.879
Which means one of us
needs to start making shmoney.

03:34.479 --> 03:37.240
- Just give it a shot, okay?
- Okay. I'll try.

03:37.639 --> 03:39.680
There's my brave road warrior.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.080
Scraps! Breakfast is ready!

03:45.759 --> 03:47.876
Kibble again? How frickin' lucky am I?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.719
Not so fast.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.159
Sit.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.479
Sit.

03:54.199 --> 03:55.756
Who's a good war dog?

03:55.840 --> 03:58.635
Who's willing to lay down
his life in combat for Mommy?

03:58.719 --> 03:59.919
I am, I am.

04:00.439 --> 04:03.276
Alright, I'm gonna get going. I don't want
to be late for my first day at work.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.916
Are you gonna be alright here?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.700
Yeah. I can warlord from anywhere.

04:07.319 --> 04:09.996
I'm gonna have these people
renouncing their old gods by lunch.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.996
I'm sure you will.
No slaughtering women and children.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.235
- I'll try. Love you.
- Love you more.

04:15.319 --> 04:17.480
- Alright. See you later.
- Bye!

04:19.279 --> 04:21.480
I ate that way too fast.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.120
- I'm gonna go take a nap.
- Okay.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.959
Excuse me. I'm looking for "The Junkman."

04:40.560 --> 04:43.410
Well, go wait in line with
the rest of the filthy animals.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.596
- No offense.
- My name's Sid.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.519
I'm your new employee.

04:48.319 --> 04:50.160
You're the new wasteland hire.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.995
Morris "The Junkman" Rubinstein
at your service. Be right with you.

04:54.079 --> 04:57.596
Alright. So, your carburetor
comes to 75 bird beaks.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.720
That's outrageous!

04:59.120 --> 05:01.755
Hey, if you think you can find
a better deal elsewhere, go for it.

05:01.839 --> 05:04.476
I think the next nearest outpost
of human civilization

05:04.560 --> 05:06.920
is about a thousand miles from here.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
I would've given it to him for
50 bird beaks, the big stinkin' lug.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.195
No offense.

05:17.279 --> 05:18.759
Closed for lunch.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.675
I like to hire one of you underprivileged
Wastelanders every year.

05:22.759 --> 05:25.036
Part of my way of giving
back to the community.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.235
Plus, I get a huge tax break.

05:27.319 --> 05:30.755
So, tell me, Sid, how much do
you know about the junk game?

05:30.839 --> 05:33.289
Isn't it just buying
and selling a bunch of trash?

05:33.800 --> 05:36.439
It's not trash. It's junk.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.156
And I'll have you know,
I've built an empire out of this stuff,

05:39.240 --> 05:42.439
ever since I received
my first rusty trombone.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.720
There it is.

05:45.199 --> 05:46.276
Yes, quite rusty.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.235
Alright, we'll start you off
as a junior junk associate

05:49.319 --> 05:51.076
and see if you're worth anything.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.235
- Any questions?
- Yeah, just where do I sit?

05:53.319 --> 05:54.396
Any small hole will do,

05:54.480 --> 05:56.195
preferably without a mutated
beast living in it,

05:56.279 --> 05:57.795
but I can obviously make that work, too.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.519
You don't have to sit in a hole.
You get a desk.

06:01.079 --> 06:03.560
I get that whole desk to myself?

06:04.839 --> 06:06.156
The chair, too?

06:06.240 --> 06:07.435
Snacks are in the kitchenette,

06:07.519 --> 06:10.636
and if you need anything else,
just ask the office manager.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.120
- Sound good?
- Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.040
This is my chair.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.079
Citizens of Boomtown,
it is I, Freya Exaltada,

06:29.240 --> 06:32.875
Commander of the Seventh Legion,
Slayer of the Dread Rat King,

06:32.959 --> 06:35.276
and High Priestess of Old Cincinnati.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.279
I command you to bend the knee
or face my axe.

06:40.639 --> 06:42.079
Citizens? Hello?

06:42.560 --> 06:43.800
Is this thing on?

06:44.199 --> 06:46.516
Hey, this is your future
overlord you're ignoring.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.639
You're being very rude.

07:01.399 --> 07:05.279
Freya Exaltada. I have been
programmed to eliminate you...

07:05.720 --> 07:07.519
for being a messy bitch.

07:11.720 --> 07:14.470
It was a joke. It's funny
how I thought I was gonna die.

07:14.759 --> 07:17.519
Scraps, you remember
my best friend, TI-90.

07:17.879 --> 07:20.235
- Call me Tai.
- What are you doing in Boomtown?

07:20.319 --> 07:22.995
I had to stop by the genius bar
to get my hardware cleaned.

07:23.079 --> 07:26.355
I hooked up with
the hottest killbot last night,

07:26.439 --> 07:28.435
but I woke up with all these pop-ups.

07:28.519 --> 07:31.755
- I really hope I don't have a virus.
- Oh, my God. You are such a ho.

07:31.839 --> 07:33.160
I know. I really am.

07:33.639 --> 07:35.476
More importantly,
what are you doing here?

07:35.560 --> 07:37.600
- Sid and I live here now.
- You do?

07:38.079 --> 07:40.129
Like some sort of ironic performance art?

07:40.439 --> 07:44.000
No. Like, as my actual life.
Why? What's wrong?

07:44.800 --> 07:47.920
- Oh, girl, we need to talk. Like, now.
- Sure.

07:48.279 --> 07:51.040
- Scraps, why don't you take over?
- Yeah, got it.

07:52.879 --> 07:57.199
Citizens of Boomtown, give me treats.
I've been a good boy.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.916
Alright, newbies,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.750
you better pay attention if you want to be
half as successful as me one day.

08:05.279 --> 08:07.040
Good one, boss. As if.

08:07.519 --> 08:08.759
Hey, Junkman!

08:09.800 --> 08:12.156
That carburetor you sold me was busted.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.396
Well, you should've read the fine print.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.040
It says, "Tough luck, sucker."

08:17.839 --> 08:19.560
You will pay for this in blood!

08:26.160 --> 08:28.560
Say, that was some pretty quick thinking.

08:29.279 --> 08:31.996
What do you say you and the missus
come over for dinner tonight?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.916
I'd like to discuss your future
at this company.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.120
My future?

08:36.879 --> 08:40.675
Yeah, I would like that very much, Mr.
Rubinstein. Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein.

08:40.759 --> 08:43.756
Freya, exactly how much
do you know about Boomtown?

08:43.840 --> 08:47.036
Not much. I mean, I've burned places
like it to the ground, if that counts.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.636
No, these people aren't like you and me.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.916
They don't care about
having fun or being cool.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.799
They've basically given up on life.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.475
Because the world is
an uninhabitable hellscape?

08:55.559 --> 08:59.276
No. Because they've settled down.
All they do is go to their boring jobs

08:59.360 --> 09:02.159
and then go back home
to their boring families.

09:02.639 --> 09:06.089
They're like robots, and I'm allowed
to say that because I am a robot.

09:06.399 --> 09:07.555
Oh, God.

09:07.639 --> 09:10.715
I think we made a horrible
mistake moving here.

09:10.799 --> 09:12.320
Freya! There you are.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.595
- We need to talk.
- Oh, Sid. Thank God.

09:15.679 --> 09:17.835
Look, I know I asked you
to give Boomtown a shot, and...

09:17.919 --> 09:20.236
Yeah, I know, and I am so glad you did.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.440
- You are?
- Yeah. I love it here.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.756
I hope I make a good impression
on Mr. Rubinstein tonight.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.595
I've never been to a fancy
dinner party before.

09:32.679 --> 09:33.759
What do you think?

09:34.600 --> 09:37.360
Found it on the corpse
of an old train conductor.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.315
- Too try-hard?
- I don't understand.

09:39.399 --> 09:41.715
I thought being a road warrior
was your whole thing.

09:41.799 --> 09:43.756
I don't know. Maybe this is my thing.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.919
You know, back in the Wasteland, I was
always so hot and covered in sand.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.799
Looking back, I think I might have been,
like, low-key depressed.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.320
I don't know. This...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.435
This feels like somewhere
I could be really happy,

09:57.519 --> 09:59.679
and I have you to thank for that.

10:02.039 --> 10:03.679
I'm so glad to hear that.

10:05.519 --> 10:07.319
I guess I should probably go change.

10:08.679 --> 10:11.120
Greetings. Welcome to Chez Morris.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.276
Good evening, Mr. Rubinstein.
This is my wife, Freya.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.600
Yes. Tis I. The wife.

10:18.759 --> 10:21.279
Morris Rubinstein.
Literal garbage person.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.240
Please, come in.

10:24.879 --> 10:27.075
This is your house?

10:27.159 --> 10:30.080
Yes, it's an authentic McMansion
from the 2020s.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.399
We kept the original laminate floors,
the chairs that only spin halfway,

10:34.919 --> 10:38.240
and after dinner,
we can retire to le ball pit.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.820
- Pretty swanky, huh?
- Yeah, this place is incredible.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.080
Honey, the guests are here!

10:46.480 --> 10:48.960
How lovely to meet you. I'm Holly.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.356
She's a ghost! Kill it!

10:51.440 --> 10:54.799
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. I forgot
to explain. Holly is a hologram.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.910
I bought her after my second
marriage hit the skids.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.555
Holly is my queen.
She's the light of my life.

11:00.639 --> 11:02.396
- And I love you, darling.
- Damn it!

11:02.480 --> 11:04.996
- I was right in the middle of talking!
- Silly me.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.530
Always forgetting my place.
I'll get dinner ready.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.600
Yeah. Why don't you do that?

11:10.679 --> 11:11.759
Ain't she a doll?

11:14.159 --> 11:16.600
I made Morris's favorite, fried rat.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.756
What can I say? I'm a foodie.

11:18.840 --> 11:23.120
I have never tried real rat before.
Thank you so much.

11:27.039 --> 11:29.200
What are you doing?
That's a cockroach fork.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.240
That's a rat fork.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.996
No, no, no. Of course. I was joking.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.236
Can you imagine if I
didn't know which fork to use?

11:36.320 --> 11:39.840
Like some feral beast.
So pathetic and stupid.

11:45.320 --> 11:49.080
So, Holly, you're a hologram.
That's cool.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.440
Oh, yes.

11:50.879 --> 11:52.715
I love doing menial chores

11:52.799 --> 11:56.299
all day and still finding time to satisfy
Morris's every want and need.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.440
- Soon enough, that'll be you.
- No!

11:59.480 --> 12:01.559
Sorry. Just girl talk.

12:02.519 --> 12:05.116
Darling, maybe I should
go home and check on Scraps.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.116
I mean, he hasn't been home
by himself before.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.516
But we just got here. I'm sure Scraps
doesn't even realize we're gone.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.879
What is happening?!

12:13.679 --> 12:16.240
Why did they do this to me?!

12:17.440 --> 12:19.519
Time is a liar!

12:23.759 --> 12:25.279
May I use the bathroom?

12:26.679 --> 12:27.715
It's right over there,

12:27.799 --> 12:31.120
but you'll need this key attached
to a giant spoon to get in.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.960
Be right back.

12:34.919 --> 12:37.159
Must be so fun to use the bathroom.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.996
This better be important!
I'm at Zion, bitch!

12:48.080 --> 12:50.955
Oh, Tai, thank God. I need you to come
rescue me from Sid's boss's house.

12:51.039 --> 12:52.435
These people are even worse
than you said.

12:52.519 --> 12:55.116
Oh, no, no. I can't leave now.
This party is lit!

12:55.200 --> 12:58.955
Everyone is so hot and sweaty
and unidentifiably multi-cultural!

12:59.039 --> 13:02.075
Please, if I stay here any longer, I think
I'm literally gonna kill one of them.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.555
Fine. Drop me a pin. I'll come get you.

13:04.639 --> 13:07.435
Yes! Oh, my God, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

13:07.519 --> 13:08.639
Love you!

13:10.039 --> 13:11.919
Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me.

13:12.279 --> 13:16.200
No, we get it. "We're all alive and free."
Get over yourselves.

13:17.519 --> 13:19.996
- Sorry about that.
- You're just in time.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.356
You didn't tell me your husband
here was born under a rock.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.075
I fairness, it was voted the seventh
best rock to give birth under,

13:25.159 --> 13:26.315
but yeah, point taken.

13:26.399 --> 13:30.480
Yes, sir, this is the life.
Big house, hot wife...

13:31.320 --> 13:33.919
and more bird beak
than I know what to do with.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.075
I mean, there must be more
to life than that, right?

13:37.159 --> 13:40.120
What about adventure,
excitement, meaning?

13:41.279 --> 13:44.636
Your wife is starting to sound like
one of those dirty Wastelanders.

13:44.720 --> 13:48.435
"Hey, man, I just want to drive my crazy
car and get into road wars."

13:48.519 --> 13:51.120
That's very good. We do sound like that.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.396
Must contain rising bloodlust.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.396
"You stole this land from the radioactive
zombies. They were here first."

13:58.480 --> 14:02.276
Oh, darling, you're so funny.
Not to mention sexually attractive.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.675
This is it.
I'm gonna murder him. It's happening.

14:05.759 --> 14:08.356
"Save the whale.
He's the last of his kind."

14:08.440 --> 14:12.320
Yeah, right. If I ever meet that whale,
I'm gonna harpoon his ass.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.876
Sorry. Door was locked.

14:16.960 --> 14:21.960
Tai? What are you doing here?
What a crazy coinki-dink.

14:22.720 --> 14:27.000
Don't you remember? You were going to
help me back up my files to the cloud.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.320
I didn't take you two
to be a couple of robot lovers.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.840
What's that supposed to mean?

14:34.200 --> 14:38.600
Oh, nothing. I think robots play a very
important role in society...

14:39.600 --> 14:42.279
for cleaning up my trash,
ya frickin' Roomba.

14:43.279 --> 14:45.159
Oh, you did not just say that.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.960
Annihilation mode, activated.

15:01.159 --> 15:02.759
You've got mail, bitch.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.595
Some people don't know
how to behave at a dinner party.

15:08.679 --> 15:10.675
Not like us, right, Mr. Rubinstein?

15:10.759 --> 15:14.360
Get out! And don't bother coming in
on Monday. You're fired!

15:16.320 --> 15:17.639
Coffee, anyone?

15:20.200 --> 15:23.195
Tonight was a disaster.
Tai was completely out of control.

15:23.279 --> 15:26.876
He's an emotionless killing machine.
Why is he always so dramatic?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.519
It wasn't Tai's fault.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.759
I asked him to come.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.195
Wait. Sorry, why?

15:33.279 --> 15:35.080
'Cause I'm not ready to settle down.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.156
I don't want to turn into
one of these boring people.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.675
I liked who we were back
in the Wasteland...

15:38.759 --> 15:42.200
Who said anything about becoming
like one of these people?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.080
You seem so happy here.
I thought that's what you wanted.

15:46.840 --> 15:50.159
Freya, I'm happy here
because I'm here with you.

15:51.480 --> 15:55.639
I don't care if we live in Boomtown
or the Wasteland or anywhere else.

15:56.679 --> 16:00.799
As long as I'm with the same
violent, sadistic,

16:01.559 --> 16:04.200
psychotic warlord
that I fell in love with.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.799
Oh, Sid.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.639
What happened?

16:16.399 --> 16:18.960
Oh, hey, you guys are back.

16:19.559 --> 16:24.360
So, it's probably not the best time,
but someone barfed in your shoes,

16:25.720 --> 16:28.519
and then... and then they ate the barf.

16:36.240 --> 16:41.159
How lucky am I that our guests left such
a big mess for me to clean up?

16:41.480 --> 16:44.480
Will you keep it down, please?
I'm trying to read the paper.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.840
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt
your studies, dear.

16:50.919 --> 16:54.200
Oh, geez. Couldn't you at least use
the other hole?

16:56.480 --> 16:59.236
It is I, Freya Exaltada,
Doom Bringer Extremus,

16:59.320 --> 17:00.715
Sultanness of the Great Garbage Islands,

17:00.799 --> 17:04.519
and Runner-Up in the third annual
Wasteland Beatbox Championships.

17:06.279 --> 17:09.116
I command you to give Sid his job back.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.200
Oh, yeah? Or what?
You'll curtsy me to death?

17:13.559 --> 17:17.279
Nope. I'm gonna beat the crap out
of you like a goddamn warlord.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.995
Stop that!

17:22.079 --> 17:26.519
Oh, Morris, I didn't know that you could
fit your head up your own butt like that.

17:27.039 --> 17:29.359
- It stinks in here!
- My flexible man.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.160
Well, it was really great
getting to know you.

17:36.559 --> 17:38.200
I know I only sat on you once,

17:38.920 --> 17:41.636
but it was probably the most meaningful
experience of my life.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.715
- Sid, can I have a word with you?
- Mr. Rubinstein, what happened to you?

17:45.799 --> 17:48.880
Nothing.
I slipped getting out of the shower.

17:49.279 --> 17:53.119
I certainly didn't have my esophagus
pulled through my butthole.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.190
On a completely unrelated note,

17:55.920 --> 17:58.359
I'm thinking of giving you your job back.

17:58.759 --> 18:00.519
Really? What changed?

18:01.200 --> 18:03.636
What? People can't change their minds
without being flayed alive

18:03.720 --> 18:06.920
and having your ribcage played
like a cartoon xylophone?

18:07.440 --> 18:09.240
So, what do you say?

18:11.039 --> 18:13.596
Thank you, Mr. Rubinstein.
Yeah, I won't let you down. I promise.

18:13.680 --> 18:17.279
Well, you better not.
I expect you to deliver, or else.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.200
And please give my regards to the missus.

18:22.559 --> 18:26.116
You know, not in a pushy way.
You know, in a polite, friendly way.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.039
- Sure.
- I mean, not too polite, either. Just...

18:29.960 --> 18:32.519
You know what?
Just forget I said anything.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.119
Welcome back.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.680
You hear that, chair?

18:45.359 --> 18:46.599
We're back!

18:51.240 --> 18:53.715
I am really excited
to go to work tomorrow.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.359
I do belong here, and I am gonna prove
that to Mr. Rubinstein.

18:57.839 --> 18:59.995
You know what? I'm excited, too.

19:00.079 --> 19:02.755
I mean, so what if Boomtown
isn't as cool as the Wasteland?

19:02.839 --> 19:04.119
We'll make it cool.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.076
- As long as we're together.
- As long as we're together.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.480
Mind if I scooch in?

19:10.079 --> 19:12.715
Scraps, you know you're not
allowed on the bed.

19:12.799 --> 19:14.079
Just for one night?

19:16.480 --> 19:18.515
I can't say no to that face.
Come in here, boy.

19:18.599 --> 19:19.680
Yes!

19:23.519 --> 19:25.279
- A little bit over.
- Okay.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.039
Yeah.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.359
This feels right.
