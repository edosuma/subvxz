WEBVTT

00:06.874 --> 00:08.804
This is delicious, Mrs. Cramblin.

00:08.854 --> 00:12.822
I know it's terrible, honey, but thank you.

00:13.456 --> 00:14.757
No, he said it was delicious.

00:14.790 --> 00:17.782
Oh, Trevor, do you wanna
join us for Sunday dinner?

00:17.807 --> 00:18.859
No can do.

00:19.002 --> 00:21.045
Trevor, your mother
invited you to sit down.

00:21.114 --> 00:23.250
- Sit down.
- Hey, uh, Jerry,

00:23.283 --> 00:25.416
why don't... why don't you eat my ass?

00:26.497 --> 00:27.643
Rude.

00:28.825 --> 00:30.157
What is he still doing in the house?

00:30.190 --> 00:31.432
I thought he moved into the house

00:31.457 --> 00:32.904
with, like, 15 of his friends.

00:32.904 --> 00:34.561
It didn't work out.

00:34.594 --> 00:37.783
They turned out all to
be backstabbers and liars.

00:37.931 --> 00:39.132
All 15 of them.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.873
They were nasty to him.

00:40.873 --> 00:42.502
- Boy needs a job.
- Jerry.

00:42.536 --> 00:44.872
- He got fired from Le Shish?
- My dad got him that job.

00:44.904 --> 00:46.173
It wasn't his fault.

00:46.206 --> 00:47.574
They were nasty to him.

00:47.607 --> 00:49.509
They wouldn't let him
choose what time he came in.

00:49.543 --> 00:51.111
So he just didn't show
up, is what you're saying?

00:51.144 --> 00:53.549
Honestly, he has to sleep in

00:53.574 --> 00:55.782
or he'll lose his voice.

00:55.816 --> 00:58.596
Besides, he doesn't have time for a job.

00:59.152 --> 01:00.877
He's very busy with Rochu.

01:01.765 --> 01:03.174
What is Rochu?

01:03.523 --> 01:06.053
Rochu is an Ultra Beast Trevor created.

01:06.053 --> 01:08.562
Look at the beautiful pictures he makes.

01:08.595 --> 01:10.764
Mom, don't put that on the fridge!

01:10.797 --> 01:13.200
The details are fantastic, Chrissy.

01:13.814 --> 01:17.571
Now, Rochu is the king
of the Banglo people.

01:17.604 --> 01:21.174
And he defeated Malgor
in the Battle of Light.

01:21.208 --> 01:23.173
- Oh.
- He's a Lich Priest.

01:23.173 --> 01:24.411
Uh... is that how you say it, Jerry?

01:24.444 --> 01:26.413
Am I... Lich... Lich Priest?

01:26.446 --> 01:27.614
I don't freakin' know.

01:27.647 --> 01:29.349
It's a bunch of cartoons
with their dicks out.

01:29.382 --> 01:31.051
- Jerry!
- They are, Sue.

01:31.084 --> 01:32.819
Some artist. Asked him to draw

01:32.853 --> 01:35.051
a picture of his mother
and me in Wings jerseys,

01:35.113 --> 01:37.453
he gives me a freakin' drippin' hog.

01:37.657 --> 01:40.293
Chrissy, you should see
the details on that hog.

01:40.481 --> 01:42.349
It's as if he's seen it.

01:42.820 --> 01:46.437
Down... to... the... veins.

01:58.937 --> 02:02.549
Oh, honey, that was great.

02:02.582 --> 02:06.063
I'll clean up.

02:06.319 --> 02:07.821
No, no, no, stop. No, no, no, stop, stop.

02:07.854 --> 02:09.005
I said stop!

02:09.489 --> 02:10.624
I said I'd clean up.

02:11.233 --> 02:12.663
- Put it back!
- Yeah.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.928
Here. Give me that.

02:16.430 --> 02:18.211
Sam, you got two answers

02:18.256 --> 02:20.000
when a woman tells you what to do.

02:20.178 --> 02:22.481
"Okay," and "Yes, honey."

02:23.577 --> 02:24.795
Is that Tim Allen?

02:25.591 --> 02:27.816
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, okay, yeah.

02:29.843 --> 02:31.278
Excuse me, I'd like to sit down, please.

02:31.579 --> 02:32.813
I was sitting here first.

02:32.846 --> 02:34.247
- I don't care.
- This is the spot I want.

02:34.281 --> 02:36.483
- I don't care.
- Well, there it is.

02:36.516 --> 02:37.814
- Move...
- So.

02:38.185 --> 02:39.760
Ohh!

02:40.020 --> 02:42.355
You only hit me in my
stomach after I just ate,

02:42.389 --> 02:44.124
- you frickin' idiot!
- Then I'll never get to

02:44.157 --> 02:45.692
- hit your fat ass.
- Ohh. Well, you shouldn't hit,

02:45.725 --> 02:47.127
- you bag of bolts.
- Whatever.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.699
God, I miss freakin' Shanahan.

02:51.164 --> 02:52.599
Mom, you can't just let Trevor

02:52.632 --> 02:53.941
move back into the house

02:53.984 --> 02:55.135
every time he screws up.

02:55.359 --> 02:56.927
Tim, he isn't like you.

02:56.961 --> 02:58.663
You weren't here for the divorce.

02:58.901 --> 03:00.202
That affected Trevor.

03:00.236 --> 03:02.696
He was 18. He should've
already been out of the house.

03:03.397 --> 03:05.192
I don't know what to do.

03:05.224 --> 03:06.456
I'm trying.

03:06.643 --> 03:09.276
Him and Jerry are at each other's throats.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.468
Trevor tosses him around like a ragdoll.

03:11.502 --> 03:12.878
He has your father's strength.

03:12.878 --> 03:14.905
He hit Jerry in the back
of the head with a chair

03:14.938 --> 03:16.214
and then Rock Bottomed him.

03:16.214 --> 03:17.541
- He Rock Bottomed him?
- Yes.

03:17.574 --> 03:18.730
That's a finisher.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.959
He needs motivation. Like you.

03:22.579 --> 03:24.448
What if you gave him a job at the office?

03:24.481 --> 03:26.570
Show him how it's done.

03:27.122 --> 03:28.163
Ah...

03:28.673 --> 03:30.287
Maybe some structure would be good for him.

03:30.321 --> 03:32.122
And he could stay with you
and Chrissy for a while.

03:32.156 --> 03:34.420
- Oh!
- Just to get him started.

03:34.541 --> 03:36.794
Transition is very hard for Trevor.

03:36.827 --> 03:38.362
- Oh, Mom.
- That way he could

03:38.395 --> 03:39.830
go straight to work with you.

03:39.863 --> 03:41.799
75 is a nightmare in the morning.

03:41.832 --> 03:43.167
He hits traffic, he turns around

03:43.200 --> 03:44.941
- and goes to the Taco Bell.
- Oh.

03:45.636 --> 03:47.291
I'll run it by Sam and Chrissy.

03:49.873 --> 03:51.287
- It'll be fine.
- Oh!

03:51.312 --> 03:52.609
I could talk to him. It'll be fine.

03:52.643 --> 03:54.044
Oh, Timmy! Thank you.

03:54.078 --> 03:55.779
You're a very good brother.

03:55.813 --> 03:57.125
- Love you, Mom.
- Very good.

03:59.350 --> 04:00.843
Hey, bud. What's up?

04:00.843 --> 04:01.952
Do not enter without knocking.

04:01.986 --> 04:03.253
Go back out and try again.

04:03.287 --> 04:04.788
No, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm already in here, Trevor.

04:04.822 --> 04:05.942
That's stupid.

04:07.291 --> 04:10.689
Hey, um, Mom told me that
you were in between jobs

04:10.689 --> 04:13.530
and we have an opening at Cramblin Duvet.

04:13.564 --> 04:16.200
Oh, what happened? Did Sam
get chronic diarrhea and die?

04:16.233 --> 04:17.635
No, don't even joke about Sam's death.

04:17.668 --> 04:19.036
We're gonna die at the same exact time.

04:19.069 --> 04:21.165
Even if we're miles apart,
our hearts will just know.

04:21.591 --> 04:23.240
You can stay with me and Chrissy.

04:23.273 --> 04:25.717
I think we could really use
your help around the office.

04:26.276 --> 04:28.078
You know, I could show you how it's done.

04:28.112 --> 04:30.065
Actually, I don't need
to be shown how it's done.

04:30.065 --> 04:31.258
I know how it's done.

04:31.615 --> 04:33.150
Well, you don't know how it's done,

04:33.183 --> 04:34.418
but I think with a little bit of work,

04:34.451 --> 04:35.486
you'd be pretty good at it.

04:35.519 --> 04:36.720
Yes, I do know how it's done

04:36.754 --> 04:38.122
and I could do advertising in my sleep.

04:38.155 --> 04:39.390
You're actually not good at advertising.

04:39.423 --> 04:40.424
You've never done it before,

04:40.457 --> 04:41.725
so how would you know if you're good at it?

04:41.759 --> 04:42.826
I do know how to do it.

04:42.860 --> 04:43.827
Okay, well then, do it, then.

04:43.861 --> 04:45.248
Fine, shithead! I'll do it!

04:45.249 --> 04:47.054
Do not call me a shithead!

04:47.197 --> 04:49.721
I'm giving you a job, a place to live!

04:49.721 --> 04:52.065
Oh, my God. Wow, thank you so much.

04:52.065 --> 04:53.937
- Oh, thank you!
- Oh, Mother Theresa!

04:53.971 --> 04:55.205
- I need to offer my body to you.
- Oh, thank you.

04:55.239 --> 04:56.907
Thank you so much. Okay, come on. Let's go!

04:56.940 --> 04:58.542
- Grab your stuff.
- What?

04:58.575 --> 05:00.644
Come on, Trevor. What...
you need to pack, don't you?

05:00.678 --> 05:01.879
- Oh, my God. Yeah.
- Don't you need

05:01.912 --> 05:03.280
- to pack some stuff, buddy?
- I gotta pack, yeah.

05:03.314 --> 05:05.849
- Oh, yeah, I gotta...
- Don't hit the dresser!

05:05.883 --> 05:07.151
- Shut up!
- That used to be yours

05:07.184 --> 05:09.586
- as a baby!
- That's my dresser!

05:09.620 --> 05:11.722
Trevor, pack your deodorant.

05:15.245 --> 05:17.263
Pack your deodorant I
got you for Christmas!

05:17.828 --> 05:19.215
Thank you!

05:19.285 --> 05:21.365
You don't need your Slipknot mask.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.215
- Yes, I do!
- When are you gonna use it?

05:23.215 --> 05:24.297
Take a shower.

05:24.297 --> 05:25.636
You take a shower in a Slipknot mask?

05:25.669 --> 05:27.480
- Yes! Shut up!
- You shut the fuck up!

05:29.406 --> 05:30.495
Morning, Sheila.

05:30.708 --> 05:31.762
Gentlemen.

05:32.379 --> 05:35.759
Trevor! My favorite Cramblin.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.616
A flower for the lady. Here you go, ma'am.

05:38.649 --> 05:41.852
Oh, ohh, Trevor, just like your father.

05:41.893 --> 05:44.052
It's been a while, but I've kept

05:44.052 --> 05:46.879
your favorite game in
my desk all these years.

05:46.904 --> 05:50.206
Oh, my God! A frickin'... a Game Guy?

05:50.207 --> 05:52.129
- Yes!
- Hey, guys.

05:52.162 --> 05:54.064
Tommy, this is my brother, Trevor.

05:54.098 --> 05:55.099
Nice to meet you, Trevor.

05:55.343 --> 05:56.433
Hey, Tommy. What's up?

05:57.469 --> 05:58.594
What's up?

06:01.155 --> 06:02.553
What's up?

06:04.567 --> 06:05.568
What's...

06:05.990 --> 06:06.955
up?

06:08.012 --> 06:10.371
- What's up?
- Has Tommy never heard

06:10.423 --> 06:11.585
the phrase, "What's up?" before?

06:11.610 --> 06:13.476
I mean, he seems pretty frickin' rocked.

06:13.939 --> 06:16.165
Hey, Lea. What's... up?

06:18.176 --> 06:19.298
What's up?

06:19.478 --> 06:22.080
Jake Tipper from Tipper's Jewelry

06:22.080 --> 06:23.515
is in your office waiting.

06:23.548 --> 06:25.217
Great. Trevor, you
wanna sit in on this one,

06:25.250 --> 06:26.551
see how it's done?

06:26.585 --> 06:28.553
Whoa. I mean, Tipper's Jewelry seems

06:28.587 --> 06:30.655
pretty big for Trevor's first day.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.090
Oh, he's gonna be fine.
He's just gonna watch.

06:32.124 --> 06:34.192
- Won't say a word.
- Unbelievable.

06:34.226 --> 06:36.094
Hear that, Trevor?
Don't say a word in here.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.467
- Yeah.
- Trevor!

06:37.492 --> 06:39.428
- Hm?
- Good luck, Trevor.

06:39.453 --> 06:41.630
So then the guy gets down on one knee,

06:41.725 --> 06:43.229
pulls out a jewelry box.

06:43.527 --> 06:45.777
In it is a note that says,

06:45.777 --> 06:48.015
"IOU one diamond."

06:48.224 --> 06:50.174
And the woman looks at him and says,

06:50.338 --> 06:53.174
"Maybe I should reconsider."

06:53.199 --> 06:56.645
You owe it to yourself to
shop at Tipper's Jewelry.

06:59.011 --> 07:00.145
That's cute.

07:00.517 --> 07:02.252
What? Okay, uh,

07:02.285 --> 07:04.221
a girl's taking her friends out to lunch.

07:04.254 --> 07:07.252
We pan around the table,
and reveal all of her friends

07:07.253 --> 07:08.648
are diamonds.

07:09.355 --> 07:11.397
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

07:13.970 --> 07:15.002
Eh.

07:15.027 --> 07:17.396
- What?
- We have... we have other ones.

07:17.429 --> 07:19.205
- Uh, this one's funny.
- He doesn't want

07:19.245 --> 07:21.797
- funny ideas, idiots.
- Shut up, Trevor!

07:22.628 --> 07:24.285
I'm sorry... I'm sorry about that.

07:24.470 --> 07:26.472
A diamond costs, what?
Three months' salary?

07:26.505 --> 07:27.606
- Wait, what are you...
- You think people

07:27.640 --> 07:30.011
- wanna joke about that?
- Go on.

07:30.508 --> 07:32.647
Guy comes home from the store,

07:32.672 --> 07:33.964
he's carrying a grocery bag.

07:33.964 --> 07:36.102
He opens up the door, he sees his wife,

07:36.102 --> 07:37.392
she's holding the baby.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.339
He reaches inside the grocery bag

07:39.372 --> 07:41.195
and he pulls out a diamond pendant.

07:41.242 --> 07:43.945
She's like, "Why? It's
not our anniversary."

07:44.144 --> 07:46.794
And he says, "I don't need a
reason to give you a diamond."

07:48.167 --> 07:50.223
She's the only reason you need.

07:52.837 --> 07:53.982
That's it.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.155
And maybe the baby craps itself.

07:57.722 --> 07:59.527
'Cause it should be a
little bit funny, I think.

07:59.561 --> 08:01.580
Ehh, that's perfect.

08:03.463 --> 08:05.902
You've cut the shit out of your lip, sir.

08:06.885 --> 08:07.902
Oh. Yeah.

08:07.936 --> 08:09.704
Ah, Sheila's got some tissues,

08:09.737 --> 08:11.283
- if you just follow me.
- All right.

08:11.573 --> 08:13.312
Price of having those rings, huh?

08:15.456 --> 08:17.479
- That was really good.
- Yeah.

08:17.512 --> 08:18.780
You know who he reminds me of?

08:18.813 --> 08:20.131
Yeah, your dad.

08:20.648 --> 08:22.951
No. I remind you of my dad.

08:22.984 --> 08:25.454
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, guys. What's... up?

08:26.592 --> 08:29.124
Tommy, I need you to get the
frickin' hell out of here.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.755
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, baby.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.647
Trevor actually did
really, really good today.

08:40.647 --> 08:42.774
- He did?
- Jake Tipper's gonna

08:42.875 --> 08:44.380
use one of his ideas for a commercial.

08:44.414 --> 08:45.982
It was amazing.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.116
Sam said he reminded him of me.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.619
That's nice, but can you please tell him

08:50.652 --> 08:53.293
- to turn that damn game down?
- Yes. Sorry.

08:56.925 --> 08:58.635
Hey, pal?

08:58.822 --> 09:00.996
Great job today, but can you turn down

09:01.029 --> 09:02.264
"Call of Duty," buddy?

09:02.297 --> 09:03.465
<i>It's "Battlefield," idiot.</i>

09:03.498 --> 09:04.933
<i>I gotta hear people's footsteps.</i>

09:04.966 --> 09:06.401
<i>You want me to get
fragged like a noob?</i>

09:06.435 --> 09:07.855
It's just a game, Trevor!

09:07.855 --> 09:09.171
<i>No, it's not!</i>

09:09.204 --> 09:10.706
<i>They use this to train NAVY SEALs.</i>

09:10.739 --> 09:13.241
Oh, so the NAVY SEALs
play "Battlefield" all day?

09:13.275 --> 09:14.710
- <i>Yes, they do!</i>
- And that's how

09:14.743 --> 09:15.967
they killed Bin Laden.

09:17.312 --> 09:19.014
No, this is actually how
they killed Bin Laden.

09:19.047 --> 09:20.849
- Boom!
- You don't fucking touch me

09:20.882 --> 09:23.462
- ever, you piece of shit!
- Ahh! Uhh! Uhh!

09:23.618 --> 09:25.587
- Ow! Ohh! Ohh!
- I didn't even touch you.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.856
- Oh, my... ahh!
- There! That hard enough?

09:27.889 --> 09:30.025
Ah! Ohh!

09:30.058 --> 09:31.234
<i>Get off my back!</i>

09:31.812 --> 09:34.074
Dumbasses. I should kick both they...

09:36.298 --> 09:38.202
Can I just stay here a little bit?

09:38.333 --> 09:40.969
Not on your fucking life.

09:41.616 --> 09:44.358
Well, I guess I'll
leave if you can make me move.

09:46.575 --> 09:48.769
What the frick... ahh!

09:49.687 --> 09:50.787
Ahh!

09:51.113 --> 09:52.814
How are you so frickin' heavy?

09:52.848 --> 09:55.450
- Ehh... frickin' whale, go home!
<i>- Get off of me, Trevor!</i>

09:55.484 --> 09:57.497
- I can't!
<i>- Get the hell off... oh!</i>

09:57.819 --> 09:58.887
<i>Ahh! Ahh!</i>

09:59.016 --> 10:01.684
Get off me, you fricking psychopath!

10:01.685 --> 10:02.866
Ugh!

10:02.866 --> 10:05.293
Fine. Stay.

10:05.327 --> 10:07.153
But don't talk during my stories.

10:10.699 --> 10:13.030
<i>R.J. Watkins on "The
New Dance Show."</i>

10:13.368 --> 10:15.303
<i>I always knew this...
we could do this.</i>

10:15.337 --> 10:17.028
<i>- Let's do it.</i>
- That's R.J. Watkins.

10:17.124 --> 10:18.774
He's the host with the
most. Who cares? Shut up.

10:20.275 --> 10:22.818
<i>- You idiot!
- You're gonna paralyze me!</i>

10:23.045 --> 10:24.046
- Ahh!
- I'm gonna beat the...

10:24.079 --> 10:25.347
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

10:25.380 --> 10:27.015
- Oh!
- Say what you will,

10:27.049 --> 10:29.016
I've never hit you with a stick.

10:29.016 --> 10:30.221
Yes, you have.

10:31.654 --> 10:32.992
Oh, yeah, I have.

10:36.658 --> 10:38.694
- You idiot!
- Welcome to the jungle!

10:38.727 --> 10:40.562
So we've cast a real
life husband and wife team

10:40.595 --> 10:42.364
to play the husband and
wife in the commercial.

10:42.397 --> 10:44.966
That way when they kiss,
they can really go at it.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.401
I don't want them to really go at it.

10:46.435 --> 10:48.637
Yeah, uh... well, not a problem.

10:48.670 --> 10:50.272
I mean, we had 'em really
go at it in the audition,

10:50.305 --> 10:51.540
so we can pull back.

10:51.573 --> 10:52.841
You know, I did have a question

10:52.874 --> 10:54.636
about the grocery bag surprise.

10:54.848 --> 10:56.244
Yeah, uh, what's the question?

10:56.278 --> 10:58.413
Actually, where's the young man that...

10:58.447 --> 10:59.718
who came up with the idea?

11:01.116 --> 11:02.784
Uh, I can go get him.

11:02.818 --> 11:04.486
Just one second.

11:06.154 --> 11:07.185
Trevor!

11:07.185 --> 11:08.190
Get in here!

11:08.368 --> 11:10.517
Put your shirt on!

11:11.173 --> 11:13.532
So Jake, I don't know
if I made it very clear

11:13.532 --> 11:14.709
when I was talking about the diamonds

11:14.742 --> 11:15.943
are a girl's best friend commercial.

11:15.977 --> 11:17.679
The diamonds would actually be animated.

11:17.712 --> 11:18.880
You know, they would each be, like,

11:18.913 --> 11:20.048
a different kind of personality.

11:20.081 --> 11:21.749
Like, there'd be, like, an old lady, uh,

11:21.783 --> 11:23.151
like, sassy old lady diamond.

11:23.184 --> 11:25.575
And, like, a dumb diamond,
you know what I'm saying?

11:25.575 --> 11:27.077
Sit down. Talk to him.

11:29.451 --> 11:30.490
Here he is, Jake.

11:32.007 --> 11:35.356
I was wondering if it
shouldn't be a grocery bag,

11:35.928 --> 11:37.685
but a bag from Tipper's.

11:38.054 --> 11:39.389
That way, it's less confusing.

11:39.422 --> 11:40.557
Yeah, I mean, we could do that.

11:40.590 --> 11:42.025
Just kinda replace the grocery bag

11:42.058 --> 11:43.193
with, like, a nice Tipper's bag.

11:43.226 --> 11:44.794
That'd be better, in fact, I think.

11:44.828 --> 11:47.464
'Cause that way, you know,
it'll say Tipper's on the bag.

11:47.497 --> 11:50.700
No, Sam, it's gotta be a
regular, every day grocery bag.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.303
It's gotta have this feeling
that you can buy jewelry

11:53.336 --> 11:55.639
at any time... when you're coming
home from the grocery store,

11:55.672 --> 11:58.128
after you bought milk, egg, cheese, beef.

11:58.408 --> 12:01.444
Yeah, like a... a diamond
in the ruffage, if you will.

12:01.478 --> 12:03.246
- No.
- You don't say no to me

12:03.280 --> 12:05.253
in the middle of the pitch.

12:05.615 --> 12:06.754
I'm sold.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.263
Grocery bag.

12:11.054 --> 12:12.289
Hey, Chrissy.

12:12.622 --> 12:14.157
I just wanna thank you
for being so understanding

12:14.190 --> 12:15.325
about Trevor.

12:15.358 --> 12:16.882
I know he can be a pain in the ass,

12:16.937 --> 12:19.471
but I really think this
has been good for us.

12:20.556 --> 12:21.970
Thank you, my sweetie...

12:25.035 --> 12:26.269
Why so serious?

12:26.303 --> 12:28.505
You freaking psycho!

12:28.538 --> 12:30.407
<i>Get out of my wife's pajamas!</i>

12:30.440 --> 12:32.742
- Make me pregnant!
- You're not my wife, idiot.

12:32.776 --> 12:35.149
- I wanna be pregnant!
- I know my wife's not a clown!

12:35.174 --> 12:36.718
- Yes!
- I know my wife's not a clown!

12:36.743 --> 12:38.929
<i>Do me, please! Give me a son!</i>

12:38.954 --> 12:40.784
<i>- I can't!
- Give me a clown son!</i>

12:46.323 --> 12:48.358
<i>R.J. Watkins on "The
New Dance Show."</i>

12:48.391 --> 12:50.460
<i>Let's do it. On the dance line.</i>

12:50.895 --> 12:52.273
Who's your favorite dancer?

12:52.462 --> 12:54.364
- General Get down.
- He's a general.

12:54.397 --> 12:56.444
- He's the best.
- Well, yeah.

12:56.618 --> 12:58.001
General Get Down's great.

12:58.034 --> 12:59.469
You know he's a bagger at Farmer Zack's?

12:59.502 --> 13:01.945
And Millionaire Greg is Dad's mailman.

13:02.789 --> 13:04.023
Who's your favorite?

13:05.844 --> 13:09.179
I'd have to say Seductra.

13:09.212 --> 13:12.065
Of course you like Seductra.

13:12.549 --> 13:14.851
She's a really great dancer.

13:14.885 --> 13:16.235
Mm-hmm.

13:16.946 --> 13:18.681
Seductra can dance.

13:18.989 --> 13:21.667
Uh, yeah. Just a little bit.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.294
Look at me!

13:24.327 --> 13:26.765
Look at me, Trevor! I'm proud of you!

13:26.997 --> 13:28.280
I'm proud of you!

13:31.289 --> 13:32.966
You're more like Dad than I am.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.087
And it kills me to admit that.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.023
I'm proud of you, Slipknot.

13:41.511 --> 13:42.589
Really?

13:43.950 --> 13:45.001
Yeah.

13:46.562 --> 13:48.155
Ohh!

13:57.561 --> 14:00.230
Hey, babe. You're up early.

14:00.263 --> 14:02.750
Big day today. Trevor's
first commercial shoot.

14:03.096 --> 14:04.467
Trevor!

14:04.501 --> 14:06.469
Let's go! Let's go, Trevor!

14:06.503 --> 14:08.917
Up, up! Wakey, wakey, let's go, pal...

14:10.120 --> 14:11.264
Damn it!

14:14.742 --> 14:15.796
Jizz.

14:16.226 --> 14:17.394
Fucking jizz.

14:23.124 --> 14:24.492
- Hey, Mom.
- Trevor told me

14:24.525 --> 14:26.561
- you were nasty to him.
- Why didn't he show up?

14:26.791 --> 14:28.826
Came crawling back to
you? Couldn't take it?

14:28.861 --> 14:30.829
You were supposed to show him the ropes!

14:30.863 --> 14:32.731
Not work him to death! He's a kid!

14:32.765 --> 14:34.271
He is not a kid, Mom!

14:34.400 --> 14:36.962
And if you baby him his entire
life, he's never gonna learn.

14:36.962 --> 14:38.321
I went out on a limb for him.

14:38.321 --> 14:39.622
At the risk of his health!

14:39.655 --> 14:40.979
He's sick as a dog.

14:41.354 --> 14:43.326
He told me he had to be
at the shoot at 7:00 a.m.

14:43.359 --> 14:45.221
Even turkeys aren't up at 7:00 a.m.

14:45.246 --> 14:47.463
What time are turkeys up, Mom?

14:47.496 --> 14:50.952
Don't you sass mouth me,
Timothy Dale Cramblin.

14:50.952 --> 14:52.034
I am here to pick up

14:52.068 --> 14:54.804
his Slipknot mask, his "Battlefield" disc

14:54.837 --> 14:56.706
and his "Five Nights at Freddy's" men.

14:56.739 --> 14:58.274
Yeah, well, you should take his sheet too,

14:58.307 --> 14:59.408
because it's caked.

14:59.442 --> 15:01.964
I'm sure I don't know what that means.

15:02.178 --> 15:03.301
Go get the stuff!

15:03.301 --> 15:05.176
Jerry wants to leave the
city before it's dark.

15:05.177 --> 15:06.449
He's terrified!

15:06.482 --> 15:07.693
All right, let's go, babe.

15:08.806 --> 15:10.734
Yo. How you doin'?

15:16.017 --> 15:18.261
He didn't even have the
balls to tell us to our face

15:18.294 --> 15:19.695
that he was gonna bail on us.

15:19.729 --> 15:21.122
You surprised?

15:21.122 --> 15:22.857
That's all he's ever done.

15:23.238 --> 15:26.101
How can you be so good at
this job and not wanna do it?

15:28.024 --> 15:29.079
What?

15:29.764 --> 15:30.879
Nothing.

15:31.216 --> 15:33.011
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, Sam.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.169
♪ Mail's here ♪

15:35.202 --> 15:36.291
Boo-yah!

15:38.706 --> 15:40.541
What the hell is your
cousin David doing here?

15:40.574 --> 15:42.476
Oh, well, Tim, since I just found out

15:42.510 --> 15:45.079
about the open door policy
for hiring family members,

15:45.112 --> 15:47.715
I figured it'd be okay for
David to come work here.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.719
You're not mad, are you? You can't be.

15:50.751 --> 15:52.386
Yeah, all right. I get it.

15:52.420 --> 15:53.888
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

15:53.921 --> 15:56.624
When you work at a company
where two people own it,

15:56.820 --> 15:59.293
all decisions need to go
through both of 'em, bud, okay?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.495
Yeah, you made your point, Sam.

16:01.529 --> 16:02.630
- Okay, that's all I'm sayin'.
- Okay.

16:02.663 --> 16:04.388
- All right? Okay?
- All right, cool.

16:04.413 --> 16:05.433
Great.

16:05.865 --> 16:06.901
Hey, David?

16:08.736 --> 16:10.438
All right, you can go on home.

16:10.776 --> 16:11.910
He got the point.

16:11.944 --> 16:14.178
- Got what?
- Tim got the prank.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.890
So this isn't a real job?

16:18.317 --> 16:19.279
Oh.

16:20.222 --> 16:21.617
Um, just one second.

16:23.801 --> 16:25.647
Joy. Hey.

16:26.306 --> 16:27.908
Yeah, the job's not real.

16:29.337 --> 16:30.825
Yeah, it was a prank on Tim.

16:32.778 --> 16:33.847
Okay.

16:34.179 --> 16:35.478
- Don't wave to us.
- Yeah.

16:35.478 --> 16:36.583
I'll do that. Sure.

16:37.847 --> 16:38.890
Guys...

16:41.391 --> 16:44.487
please, please, please don't do this!

16:44.520 --> 16:46.489
- I need this job.
- David, stand up.

16:46.522 --> 16:48.324
You can finish up the
rest of the week, okay?

16:48.358 --> 16:50.418
Thanks, Sam. I broke your stapler.

16:51.561 --> 16:53.896
Hey, David. What's... up?

16:54.779 --> 16:55.786
Just dumb.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.901
<i>We went the Pegasus.
I got a Wings jersey.</i>

16:59.584 --> 17:02.066
We even walked a block. Wasn't bad.

17:02.338 --> 17:04.140
That city's gotten okay.

17:04.743 --> 17:05.873
In certain parts.

17:06.179 --> 17:07.993
We were asked for change.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.760
But the guy was funny, actually.

17:12.636 --> 17:15.002
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Thank you.

17:15.672 --> 17:17.515
Chrissy and I applied and got in to be

17:17.515 --> 17:18.549
on "The New Dance Show."

17:18.582 --> 17:20.684
- Oh!
- Yeah, so excited.

17:26.577 --> 17:27.739
<i>Enter.</i>

17:30.127 --> 17:31.315
What the hell, man?

17:31.695 --> 17:33.364
You sneak back to Mom's
in the middle of the night,

17:33.397 --> 17:34.865
leave a puddle of rope on the bed?

17:35.404 --> 17:36.801
It's my two weeks notice.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.616
Trevor, you need to grow up.

17:40.004 --> 17:42.649
You can't just run away from everything.

17:43.514 --> 17:45.577
I'll tell you what. I'll give you a pass.

17:45.602 --> 17:46.950
You can come back and work for me.

17:46.975 --> 17:48.610
I tried it, I didn't like it.

17:48.643 --> 17:49.954
It was stupid, it was dumb.

17:50.057 --> 17:51.530
But you're so good at it.

17:51.840 --> 17:52.968
It's easy.

17:53.543 --> 17:55.244
It's your thing, man. It's not mine.

17:55.278 --> 17:56.395
What do you mean?

17:56.613 --> 17:57.914
Look, remember when we were kids

17:57.947 --> 17:59.994
and we would race and
you were faster than me,

18:00.019 --> 18:02.003
so you'd slow down and let me win?

18:02.028 --> 18:03.438
- Yeah.
- It's like that.

18:04.064 --> 18:05.142
Oh, my God.

18:05.714 --> 18:07.290
You quit because you're better than me

18:07.323 --> 18:09.148
and you didn't wanna make me feel bad.

18:10.418 --> 18:11.434
Oh...

18:12.503 --> 18:14.005
Give me the Slipknot mask.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.687
Give me Shawn Clown.

18:23.568 --> 18:24.702
Trevor!

18:24.736 --> 18:26.170
When we were racing,

18:26.551 --> 18:28.539
I didn't slow down so you could beat me.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.310
I didn't slow down.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.901
I just got tired.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.431
Mind if we join you guys?

18:51.740 --> 18:54.401
All my boys at the table together.

18:55.378 --> 18:57.303
Tim, you been crying?

18:57.722 --> 18:59.299
No, I'm just a little hot.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.739
Hey, uh, Sam, you mind
passing me the spaghetti?

19:01.782 --> 19:04.258
And by the way, diamonds
are a girl's best friend

19:04.283 --> 19:05.394
was really funny.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.481
Oh, thank you, Trevor.

19:09.006 --> 19:12.286
And you know what? Yours
was pretty good, too.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.915
Although, it coulda been a little funny.

19:13.948 --> 19:15.450
I mean, people remember
the ones that are funny,

19:15.483 --> 19:16.618
- in my experience.
- Yeah, so that's why

19:16.651 --> 19:17.786
they did yours, right?

19:17.819 --> 19:19.120
You piece of shit.

19:19.278 --> 19:21.079
Take your hat off at the table, Trevor.

19:21.113 --> 19:23.820
Hey, Jerry, why don't you suck my balls?

19:23.820 --> 19:26.374
Take your hat off at the table, Trevor.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.420
Let him wear his hat, Jerry.

19:28.453 --> 19:31.390
No, Sue. You think I
don't wanna be here eating

19:31.423 --> 19:32.929
with my Panama hat on?

19:33.192 --> 19:34.382
Take the hat off.

19:35.714 --> 19:37.162
Take the damn hat off.

19:37.196 --> 19:38.377
Oh.

19:38.797 --> 19:41.601
That's it! Time to take you to the bottom!

19:41.900 --> 19:43.669
- The Rock Bottom!
- No!

19:44.870 --> 19:46.605
- Ohh!
- Rock Bottom!

19:46.638 --> 19:48.073
- Oh, shit!
- Rock bottom!

19:48.106 --> 19:49.775
- That man got broken in half!
- Oh, shit!

19:49.808 --> 19:51.009
- On ramp!
- Infinite Rock Bottoms!

19:51.043 --> 19:52.678
- You never saw Rock Bottom!
- That man is dead!

19:52.711 --> 19:54.780
I am the new dad!

19:55.187 --> 19:57.128
We're back, we're back
on "The New Dance Show."

19:57.128 --> 19:59.718
This is R.J. Watkins and
we have two new dancers

19:59.748 --> 20:00.916
on our dance show tonight.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.479
- And this is?
- Rosie the Boogier.

20:03.786 --> 20:07.122
- And?
- Uh, Emperor King Gold

20:07.156 --> 20:09.725
- uh, The Midas Man.
- Fantastic.

20:09.985 --> 20:12.370
And now it's time for a dance
line on "The Dance Show."

20:12.955 --> 20:15.057
Can you break me off
something a little funky?

20:29.038 --> 20:31.668
- You had your turn.
- Turn's not over yet.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.492
- You're doin' too much.
- You ain't doin' enough.

20:37.127 --> 20:38.062
Uh!

20:38.352 --> 20:40.493
You don't open-hand slap me on TV!

20:41.584 --> 20:42.885
Ahh!

20:42.918 --> 20:44.167
Ohh!

20:47.050 --> 20:48.913
I just ate!

21:00.448 --> 21:01.794
What's up?

21:04.969 --> 21:06.434
What's up?

21:08.847 --> 21:10.379
What's up?

21:13.037 --> 21:15.452
Hey, Lea. What's up?

21:16.305 --> 21:22.808
