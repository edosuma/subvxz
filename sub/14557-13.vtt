WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.605
* *

00:27.528 --> 00:29.097
I'm feeling lucky tonight.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.338
Changing $5,000.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.681
Now there's a man
with confidence.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.983
MAN: Yeah, I'd love
to join you, partner,

00:50.050 --> 00:52.019
but I have two ex-wives
counting on me.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.454
How about you?

00:53.521 --> 00:55.656
I think I'll stick with
my 3-iron off the tee.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.091
Straight and safe, huh?

00:57.158 --> 00:59.660
* *

01:15.443 --> 01:17.945
-( heavy accent ): Split them.
-Where you from, kid?

01:18.011 --> 01:19.079
Moscow.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.714
But my dad's business

01:20.781 --> 01:21.982
brings me to L.A. a lot.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.118
Daddy's business
must be good, huh?

01:28.656 --> 01:30.658
( chuckles ):
You are lucky, son.

01:35.996 --> 01:36.930
Dealer busts.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.666
( sighs )

01:40.801 --> 01:43.937
Looks like everybody's
pretty lucky here tonight.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.206
Sit in, find out for yourself.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.208
I lost too much already.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.409
Maybe next time.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.248
You leaving?

01:54.315 --> 01:56.850
Just need a little fresh air.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.887
In L.A.? Good luck.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.827
I need my car.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.362
Sorry, man,
we're shorthanded.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.664
It's going to be a wait.

02:10.731 --> 02:15.403
If you want to get it yourself,
I can tell you where to go.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.604
( alarm beeps )

02:19.307 --> 02:20.841
( gun cocks )

02:23.043 --> 02:25.179
You want my money?

02:26.079 --> 02:29.116
( gunshot )

02:29.183 --> 02:31.252
Task force got the call
about an hour ago.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.687
Gunshot was reported
at 10:10 p.m.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.722
Any witnesses?

02:34.788 --> 02:36.123
Not so far.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.125
That makes four robberies
at this location

02:38.192 --> 02:39.427
in the past six months.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.362
First homicide, though.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.396
Manager says they installed

02:42.463 --> 02:44.432
a camera
after the last robbery.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.935
Might get a look off that.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.238
Also found this in the truck.

02:54.642 --> 02:58.479
That's a lot of notebooks.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.216
It's all numbers, equations.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.220
Lucky for us, we know a guy.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.422
We do know a guy.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.424
Wallet was tossed.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.361
Cash and credit cards
are missing.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.897
DON:
Yuri Chernov.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.500
Born '86.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.634
19.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.603
That's kind of young
for a high roller.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.372
DON:
Yeah, Huntington Tech undergrad.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.774
Picked the wrong night
to take a study break.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.808
Yep.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.983
CHARLIE:
We all use math every day,

03:36.049 --> 03:37.785
to predict weather,

03:37.851 --> 03:40.521
to tell time,

03:40.588 --> 03:43.891
to handle money.

03:43.957 --> 03:48.061
Math is more than
formulas and equations.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.299
It's logic...

03:51.365 --> 03:53.334
it's rationality.

03:53.401 --> 03:57.638
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.012
Well, I've heard about this,

04:05.078 --> 04:06.580
but I've never actually
seen it demonstrated.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.115
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

04:08.181 --> 04:09.082
Absolutely.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.851
DON: Hey, Charlie,
I've been looking for you.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.654
Hey, hey, hey.
Come over here, man.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.123
So this is for a lecture I'm
preparing-- "Math and Molecules:

04:16.189 --> 04:17.758
An Introduction
to Fluid Dynamics."

04:17.825 --> 04:21.362
It looks like mints
and soda to me.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.763
Well, two words:
surface tension.

04:22.830 --> 04:27.635
The stuff that gives soda its
fizz is a gas, carbon dioxide.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.103
What holds the gas inside
the liquid is surface tension.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.339
And we all know the importance

04:31.405 --> 04:32.973
of surface tension
in fluid dynamics.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.542
We do?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.810
Bubbles of gas in the soda

04:36.877 --> 04:38.812
experience viscous drag force
from the surrounding liquids.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.349
The mints hyper-excite
the thermodynamic equilibrium

04:41.415 --> 04:43.283
of the supersaturated CO2,

04:43.351 --> 04:45.919
weakening the surface tension,

04:45.986 --> 04:49.590
causing the gases to escape
rapidly, very rapidly.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.326
You guys actually
get paid for this?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.094
Despite your brother's
adolescent grin,

04:54.161 --> 04:55.763
this is actually very
sophisticated math here.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.332
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm ready to do this.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.967
-Are you guys ready?
-LARRY: Step back.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.635
Sure you don't need
a permit or something for this?

05:01.702 --> 05:02.836
CHARLIE:
Here we go.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.009
( laughs )
Yeah!

05:09.076 --> 05:10.344
That's awesome.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.680
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.815
So who cleans all this up now?

05:14.882 --> 05:18.018
I am... gonna clean it,
probably... later.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.153
Uh, I'm assuming
you're not here for the show.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.889
Um, yeah.

05:21.955 --> 05:22.890
This is Yuri Chernov,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.426
who was actually a math student
at Huntington Tech.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.161
They've got a brilliant
undergrad program there.

05:28.228 --> 05:31.465
Well, he was murdered last night
and we found this in his car.

05:31.532 --> 05:35.769
Thought maybe you could
figure out what it means.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.472
Those are probability
calculations.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.808
If I could, these equations,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.776
they just seem a little
familiar to me.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.379
Have you worked
with these equations?

05:45.446 --> 05:46.714
I don't know.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.283
If I could just examine them
more closely.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.819
DON:
All right, let me...

05:51.885 --> 05:54.755
can I make a copy
in your office?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.524
-Hey, Larry?
-Oh, uh...

05:56.590 --> 05:57.591
I'll bring it right back.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.793
I'm just gonna
make a copy, all right?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.934
Yuri's parents
are flying in today.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.603
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.472
Well, I can
talk to them for you,

06:11.539 --> 06:12.873
if that would
make things easier.

06:12.940 --> 06:17.244
No, I-I should be
the one to tell them.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.279
They always liked me.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.280
Really?

06:20.347 --> 06:23.150
How long did you two date for?

06:23.216 --> 06:26.487
About a year.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.355
We broke up a couple
of months ago.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.559
May I ask why?

06:31.625 --> 06:35.228
The gambling.

06:35.295 --> 06:38.632
At first, it was just
sort of a weekend thing for fun.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.401
Then it got to be that's
all he would talk about,

06:41.469 --> 06:42.703
all he'd do.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.572
He'd play all day,
all weekend.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.242
And did he start
getting into debt?

06:49.309 --> 06:51.579
It was the opposite.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.980
He just kept winning.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.682
And the more he won,

06:54.748 --> 06:59.587
Yuri got into this whole
player vibe--

06:59.653 --> 07:02.523
dressing differently,
acting differently.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.092
And that's why
you guys broke up?

07:05.158 --> 07:09.930
Crazy thing is,
a couple of days ago,

07:09.997 --> 07:13.200
I thought we might
get back together.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.668
He called and apologized.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.136
Said he was going to quit.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.873
Did he tell you why?

07:19.940 --> 07:24.545
He said he made a mistake...

07:24.612 --> 07:26.880
a big one,

07:26.947 --> 07:30.984
but that things
were going to be okay now.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.291
Excuse me, do you mind stopping
just for a second?

07:38.358 --> 07:39.426
Thanks.

07:39.493 --> 07:43.764
So Yuri Chernov is shot at close
range with a nine millimeter?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.033
Right, nine mil, I mean,
there should be some casings.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.968
Yeah, none were found.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.438
You know, the witness from
the last robbery at the casino

07:51.505 --> 07:52.906
described a .38 caliber.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.074
Right.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.209
The whole thing feels like
a different guy to me,

07:56.276 --> 07:57.778
so different gun.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.680
Yeah.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.081
What's up, boys?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.149
What's going on?

08:02.215 --> 08:03.116
Check this out.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.218
We found these
in Yuri Chernov's dorm room.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.254
Ah, driver's
licenses, fake IDs.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.457
DAVID: He had different
wardrobes in his closet,

08:10.524 --> 08:12.092
hair dyes in his bathroom.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.260
Yeah, look at this.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.896
He's got a different look
in each one of these.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.765
COLBY:
Checked his transcripts,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.667
straight A student,
total math geek.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.135
Well, none of this
fits that profile, right?

08:22.202 --> 08:24.972
No, but the ex told me that
he was playing the player role,

08:25.038 --> 08:26.306
and that he wanted out of it.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.008
Did we get anything
from these security cameras?

08:28.075 --> 08:29.643
Nothing. They're blind spots.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.411
Should we check inside?

08:31.478 --> 08:32.780
Club's eye in the sky, right?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.549
Yeah, maybe we can find
someone shadowing the kid.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.887
Something wrong, Charlie?

08:39.953 --> 08:42.623
I've been thinking about
this lecture I gave

08:42.690 --> 08:43.991
on applied probability.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.093
What, the famous casino night?

08:46.159 --> 08:49.496
Oh, yes, "Applying Probability
to Games of Chance."

08:49.563 --> 08:51.031
An Eppes classic.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.133
Turning the class
into a mini-casino

08:53.200 --> 08:57.437
and applying probability theory
to roulette, poker, blackjack.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.972
Gets kids hooked.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.774
I gave that lecture
as my guest lecture

09:00.841 --> 09:02.876
at Huntington Tech last year.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.445
Wait, you're not seriously
proposing a causal connection

09:05.512 --> 09:07.781
between this student's death
and your lecture?

09:07.848 --> 09:10.918
Students gamble, Charlie.

09:10.984 --> 09:11.985
Remember those MIT students?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.386
They took the casinos
for millions.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.657
How about the book that just
came out on blackjack strategy?

09:16.724 --> 09:17.725
What was it, Busting Vegas?

09:17.791 --> 09:20.127
Okay, maybe this student
read that book.

09:22.262 --> 09:26.934
Look, if anything,
I think I'm the one

09:27.000 --> 09:28.702
to proffer a mea culpa here.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.972
The moment Don showed me
these equations,

09:32.039 --> 09:33.373
I recognized them immediately.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.274
What?

09:34.341 --> 09:37.678
These are calculations
for card counting,

09:37.745 --> 09:39.579
blackjack, to be precise.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.749
You're a blackjack stud?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.984
Was a blackjack stud, okay?

09:44.051 --> 09:47.554
And in the unfinished biography
of my life,

09:47.621 --> 09:51.024
that is very much
a closed chapter.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.092
Outside of bulk calculations,

09:52.159 --> 09:53.927
what's involved
in card counting?

09:55.528 --> 09:57.030
You said
you attended my lecture.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.932
I had to duck out
after roulette.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.367
I was prepping
for my orals, sorry.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.836
Yeah, yeah, so much
for an Eppes classic.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.105
Well, blackjack
is all about math.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.307
The point is to hit 21
without going over.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.343
The game is ruled
by conditional probabilities.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.680
What you see affects
what you're going to see.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.482
If an ace is dealt,
then there's one less ace

10:15.548 --> 10:16.449
in the remaining cards.

10:16.516 --> 10:19.186
And knowing how the cards
are likely to be dealt

10:19.252 --> 10:21.188
works to the card counter's
advantage, because players can

10:21.254 --> 10:22.522
ask for a card
whenever they want.

10:22.589 --> 10:26.593
But a dealer must take a card
when the total is below 17

10:26.660 --> 10:30.764
and can't take a card when
the total is between 17 and 21.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.266
So lower value cards
favor the dealer,

10:33.333 --> 10:35.869
because there's less likely
chance that he'll bust.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.437
MAN:
21.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.140
The opposite is true
for aces and picture cards.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.809
Each of them are worth ten.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.811
They favor the player,
because the more of them

10:43.877 --> 10:45.012
that are left in the deck,

10:45.078 --> 10:47.547
the more chances
for the dealer to bust.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.982
24, dealer busts.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.884
Now keeping exact track
isn't easy,

10:50.951 --> 10:53.921
but card counters use
certain techniques, like, uh...

10:53.987 --> 10:55.155
Like assigning general values.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.025
Uh, plus one for cards
two through six, minus one

10:58.091 --> 11:00.627
for picture cards,
aces, tens,

11:00.694 --> 11:02.696
zeros for seven, eight, nine.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.231
Okay.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.365
Larry. Uh...

11:05.432 --> 11:08.468
Well, I'm sure you'll
correct me if I'm wrong,

11:08.535 --> 11:10.037
but doesn't that allow

11:10.103 --> 11:11.471
the card counter
to keep a tally?

11:11.538 --> 11:13.673
Yeah, yeah, yeah. High number
count favors a player,

11:13.741 --> 11:14.908
they make their bets
accordingly.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.810
Doesn't that attract attention?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.078
Yeah, of course it does.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.714
Sometimes
with grave consequences.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.117
You got caught.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.922
"Eyes In The Sky"
has Yuri Chernov gambling

11:28.989 --> 11:30.390
for seven hours that day,

11:30.457 --> 11:31.792
starting at 3:00.

11:31.859 --> 11:32.826
He made 20 grand.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.062
All right, so high roller,
a lot of cash,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.229
same as the other robberies...

11:36.296 --> 11:37.564
MEGAN:
Except none of the other

11:37.630 --> 11:38.598
robberies escalated to violence.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.667
-That's what I was going to say.
-Let alone homicide.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.535
And I don't see Chernov

11:42.602 --> 11:44.137
challenging a guy with a gun.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.806
Well, so, then
we're talking murder.

11:45.873 --> 11:46.907
MEGAN: Yeah, and then
you throw in

11:46.974 --> 11:48.041
the fake IDs and the disguises,

11:48.108 --> 11:49.676
and I just think
there's something more here

11:49.743 --> 11:50.878
than a robbery gone wrong.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.012
I see what you're saying,
and I agree.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.013
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.982
-Hi.
-CHARLIE: Larry has something

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
he'd like to say to you all.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.119
Yeah. Um, Don,
I owe you an apology.

11:59.186 --> 12:02.089
I withheld, uh, my insights

12:02.155 --> 12:04.457
due to personal discomfort
with, uh...

12:04.524 --> 12:06.693
past non-scientific exploits.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.628
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What...
What are you talking about?

12:08.695 --> 12:11.198
The notebooks that you found
in Yuri Chernov's car--

12:11.264 --> 12:14.167
they're filled
with card-counting equations.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.103
CHARLIE:
Larry thinks that Yuri

12:16.169 --> 12:18.571
was card counting
at blackjack at the club.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.407
Yeah? How do you know that?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.575
MEGAN:
Are you saying that you were

12:22.642 --> 12:24.244
a card counter, Larry?

12:24.311 --> 12:27.014
The salient point here
is that casinos and clubs,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.648
even other players--
they regard

12:28.715 --> 12:31.785
card counting as cheating, and

12:31.852 --> 12:34.387
this practice has led to certain
acts of violence on occasion.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.389
COLBY: The only thing is,
Professor-- and I don't mean

12:36.456 --> 12:39.126
to dis your theory-- but
we've been looking at this tape,

12:39.192 --> 12:40.727
and this kid--
he's been drinking

12:40.794 --> 12:41.528
and throwing money
around haphazardly.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.663
I mean, it doesn't really look
like a system.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.332
It just looks kind of
like dumb luck.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.035
And the sum total
of said dumb luck?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.270
20 grand.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.772
To beat the house, there's more
than one way to skin a cat.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.807
Can-Can we somehow just roll

12:53.874 --> 12:55.342
back to the point
where Yuri Chernov

12:55.408 --> 12:56.910
first begins to play?

12:56.977 --> 13:00.914
Okay, now, the card counter
faces one major obstacle

13:00.981 --> 13:02.916
to success...

13:02.983 --> 13:04.184
Transparent betting patterns.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.686
In order to make money,
a card counter has to raise

13:06.753 --> 13:09.222
or lower his bets based
on-on the count.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.058
That's right, and that's
where the team comes in.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.659
A team uses a spotter to count.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.362
Now the spotter will bet small.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.429
He stays inconspicuous.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.531
But that spotter
will signal the big player

13:18.598 --> 13:19.833
when the count is high.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.634
There you go, right there,
that's him.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.637
MEGAN: Okay, so you're saying
the guy in the purple,

13:24.704 --> 13:27.340
the preppy guy, is our spotter?

13:27.407 --> 13:28.942
Well, I mean,
unless he just has an itchy ear.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.077
DAVID:
Wait a minute.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.744
That guy that just walked in,

13:31.811 --> 13:35.182
in the yellow and green--
we've seen him before, right?

13:35.248 --> 13:38.118
Yeah, actually, he was
playing earlier, and he was

13:38.185 --> 13:39.652
throwing money around
the same way Chernov was.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.922
Was this guy playing

13:41.989 --> 13:44.524
with our spotter,
the preppy guy?

13:44.591 --> 13:45.792
DAVID:
Yeah.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.060
They were at the same table.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.428
Well, there you go.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.097
LARRY:
And then

13:50.163 --> 13:52.299
there were three.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.042
So, we're looking at a team
of card counters...

14:02.109 --> 14:04.211
Yeah, well, look, if that's
who got Chernov killed,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.113
we better find those partners,
'cause they're next.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.315
DAVID: All the kids
are in disguises.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.683
It might take some time
to find them.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.120
If Chernov was a student,
maybe the other two are, also.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.322
You know where to go.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.589
Huntington Tech.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.991
All right, see you later.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.227
Larry said these card rings
often have a backer

14:20.293 --> 14:22.362
who puts up money
at the beginning,

14:22.429 --> 14:24.264
and then takes a percentage
of the split.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.166
Maybe the guy got tired
of the split.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.867
All right,
so the backer's a suspect,

14:27.935 --> 14:30.337
but I don't want to rule out
that club yet, either, you know?

14:33.941 --> 14:35.142
CHARLIE:
So, you had a gambling problem.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.409
It only makes you

14:36.476 --> 14:38.845
that much more colorful,
you know, Larry?

14:38.912 --> 14:40.547
Just-Just so you realize,

14:40.613 --> 14:42.682
you know,
this wasn't some hobby.

14:42.749 --> 14:43.951
This was a calling.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.953
This was our way
of just demonstrating

14:46.019 --> 14:48.956
to the world the power
of mathematics.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.623
So winning money had nothing
to do with it?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.559
Not at all. No.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.793
Not...

14:53.860 --> 14:56.229
Not initially,
but listen, remember

14:56.296 --> 14:58.765
that a mathematician
named Ed Thorpe

14:58.831 --> 15:00.300
had already created a sensation

15:00.367 --> 15:02.102
back in the '60s
when he wrote this book

15:02.169 --> 15:03.903
called Beat the Dealer.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.138
Now, in response to that book,

15:05.205 --> 15:08.241
casinos introduced
the card shoe.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.477
Actually, they were called
"perfesser stoppers."

15:10.543 --> 15:12.445
And a few mathematicians
like myself,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.681
I mean, we saw it
as a challenge.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.216
David versus Goliath,

15:16.283 --> 15:18.551
uh, wits and nerves
versus cameras

15:18.618 --> 15:20.120
and high tech thuggery.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.821
What do you mean "thuggery"?

15:21.888 --> 15:23.323
Oh, listen to this.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.926
I was playing at a private
card club in Atlantic City.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.428
I was up $20,000.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.696
$20,000?

15:29.762 --> 15:30.930
Yeah, yeah.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.599
And the manager
and two pit bosses--

15:32.665 --> 15:34.201
they took me into the back room

15:34.267 --> 15:37.070
where they were cracking nuts
with pliers,

15:37.137 --> 15:39.239
and they told me
that mine were next.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.641
But they didn't...
I mean, you're still...

15:41.708 --> 15:43.810
No, I remain whole,
but I had friends

15:43.876 --> 15:46.346
whose fingers were broken,
who had kneecaps reconfigured.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.715
I mean, they said
we were cheaters.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.950
No, we were playing smart.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.220
Smarter than these kids today.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.056
We weren't losing our lives.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.392
( computer beeping )

15:59.459 --> 16:01.728
COLBY:
You got face recognition?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.396
Oh, yeah.
Our high rollers

16:03.463 --> 16:06.366
versus The Huntington Tech
online face book.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.437
I'm still trying
to get used to the idea

16:10.503 --> 16:13.273
of Larry Fleinhardt,
the player.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.575
COLBY: They say Einstein
was a chick magnet, right?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.110
Yeah.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.878
All right, that's our spotter
right there.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.848
Jason Brewer, 19.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.783
Second year math major.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.386
Local boy, West L.A.

16:26.453 --> 16:30.123
And our rich South American,
Ignacio Nadal.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.991
I wonder
if these two kids have any idea

16:32.059 --> 16:34.827
how much trouble they're in.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.597
I've given you statements,
handed over tapes.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.731
We want to help.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.533
These robberies
aren't good for business.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.203
Actually, we're not sure
that the shooting was a robbery.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.272
There are indications
that the victim is part

16:45.338 --> 16:47.440
of a card-counting scheme.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.210
I can't really say
you look surprised.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.180
Surprised people cheat? No.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.215
What happens
when they get caught?

16:55.282 --> 16:56.783
We walk them out the door.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.085
That's it?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.819
You think we shoot 'em?

16:59.886 --> 17:03.323
Maybe one of your employees
got a little overzealous?

17:03.390 --> 17:05.225
Guy wins five grand,

17:05.292 --> 17:07.360
I'm not risking 20 to
life going after him.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.162
That's just Economics 101.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.597
Did you know

17:10.663 --> 17:12.965
there was a card-counting ring
working your club?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.203
If I knew,
they wouldn't be here.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.038
I still think I'm going
to need to see a list

17:19.106 --> 17:21.308
of employees
over the past six months,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.510
particularly the ones
working security.

17:23.576 --> 17:27.214
'Cause that's just
Law Enforcement 101.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.216
DAVID:
When was the last time

17:29.282 --> 17:30.883
you saw your son,
Mrs. Brewer?

17:30.950 --> 17:32.085
About a week ago.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.986
My husband
and I have been out of town.

17:34.053 --> 17:34.921
Paris.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.589
Have you spoken to him since
you've been back?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.591
We got in late last night,
and when we got up this morning,

17:38.658 --> 17:40.460
it looked like
Jason was already gone.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.262
Should I call my husband
at work?

17:42.329 --> 17:44.331
I mean, is my son Jason
in trouble?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.598
We hope not, ma'am.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.334
It just seems that
a couple of his college friends

17:47.400 --> 17:49.136
may have gotten themselves
into a bit of a jam.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.803
You're talking about
Ignacio and Yuri.

17:50.870 --> 17:51.771
You know them?

17:51.838 --> 17:53.840
Jason and the boys have been
hanging out together

17:53.906 --> 17:55.074
quite a bit.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.409
We try to give Jason his space.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.845
That was the whole idea of his
taking over the guest house.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.651
We keep this for emergencies.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.092
COLBY:
Were you aware

18:13.160 --> 18:14.961
of this, ma'am?

18:15.027 --> 18:17.197
No. As I said, we...

18:17.264 --> 18:18.898
Try to give your son his space.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.767
The kid's running
a little casino out of here.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.636
-Probably uses it to practice.
-Practice? Practice what?

18:23.703 --> 18:27.140
COLBY: Your son plays an awful
lot of blackjack, ma'am.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.741
What are you talking about?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.245
Yuri Chernov was shot
last night.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.147
He's dead.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.549
No.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.751
Please let us do our jobs,
ma'am.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.587
I'm going to go

18:40.653 --> 18:42.121
call my husband.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.790
I think that's a good idea.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.209
Take a look at this.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.843
Looks like Yuri Chernov

19:03.910 --> 19:07.347
wasn't the only one
using fake IDs and disguises.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.155
Wait a minute.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.626
Check this out.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.693
Wow, looks like

19:20.760 --> 19:22.362
they were keeping
pretty careful records.

19:22.429 --> 19:25.164
Yeah. Any luck, it might lead us
to their backer.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.499
Yeah.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.669
Now, if I can take
this data here

19:29.736 --> 19:31.671
and isolate the student's
gambling history,

19:31.738 --> 19:33.373
maybe I can analyze
the money flow,

19:33.440 --> 19:34.741
maybe find a pattern.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.277
You could use multivariate
time series analysis

19:37.344 --> 19:38.778
to break the money down

19:38.845 --> 19:39.646
by specific days,

19:39.712 --> 19:41.648
-even hours.
-That's a really good idea.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.715
Wow.

19:42.782 --> 19:46.386
Oh, once again, my living room
has become a Cal Sci annex.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.121
Your-Your living room.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.257
My garage is full.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.124
All of my cognitive theory work,
so ...

19:52.191 --> 19:53.726
ALAN:
Why am I not surprised?

19:53.793 --> 19:54.527
What is this?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.128
AMITA: Well, the student
who was murdered--

19:56.195 --> 19:58.598
he and his two friends were
members of a card-counting team.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.267
Don asked Charlie
to have us look

20:00.333 --> 20:01.934
at this data to see
if we could discover

20:02.001 --> 20:03.035
who was bankrolling them.

20:03.102 --> 20:03.536
Card counting.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.204
Isn't that called cheating?

20:05.272 --> 20:08.608
Card counting is not cheating.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.777
It is the application
of probability theory to a game.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.144
ALAN:
Yeah, well, all those schmucks

20:12.211 --> 20:14.481
who play the game for fun--
they think it's cheating.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.148
LARRY: Well, those are
the same schmucks

20:16.215 --> 20:17.183
that should stick
to slot machines.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.752
ALAN: Well, you see,
that's why I like playing poker.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.954
'Cause I can handle the ones
that try to take advantage.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.691
Poker, I mean, you got
to have a mind, a pair of eyes.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.827
These probability grids--

20:27.894 --> 20:29.296
they go way

20:29.362 --> 20:31.631
beyond simple high-low counting.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.132
These were math students, Larry.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.367
LARRY:
Oh, oh.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.802
This-This is not
undergraduate work.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.437
You're saying
someone helped them?

20:37.504 --> 20:39.406
You know, this is reminding me
of someone.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.642
There was this guy Leonard,
and he and I

20:42.709 --> 20:44.577
were in graduate
school together.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.979
When the casinos opened
in Atlantic City, we were there

20:47.046 --> 20:48.548
the very first day.

20:48.615 --> 20:52.585
We were using counting systems,
probability grids like this,

20:52.652 --> 20:54.454
though these are at
a much higher level.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.656
Leonard Philbrick.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.691
Well, why haven't we heard
this name before, Larry?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.528
I don't... It's just not
a-a part of my life

21:01.594 --> 21:03.796
that I'm particularly proud of.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.232
I mean, I've moved on
from my obsession.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.268
But not so with Leonard.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.404
He lost his wife,
he lost his career,

21:11.471 --> 21:14.407
and he was a man
of great promise.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.843
I'll tell you something.

21:16.909 --> 21:20.179
Whoever did this
was a mathematician.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.948
You can bet on that.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.316
We were able to reach

21:23.383 --> 21:25.017
Ignacio Nadal's mom in Detroit.

21:25.084 --> 21:25.918
Single parent.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.754
Says he missed his
weekly call home.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.956
-She seems worried. -All right,
well, that's two kids

21:30.022 --> 21:30.957
no one's heard from.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.126
The fake IDs and disguises
in Brewer's place,

21:34.193 --> 21:36.463
you got to assume Nadal's
working the same angle, right?

21:36.529 --> 21:37.630
Anything in the dorm?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.699
No, looks like he cleared
out of there in a hurry.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.568
So both of these
kids are on the run.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.235
Hey, I was just looking
for you guys.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.704
Larry came up with a name.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.106
The probability grids
and algorithms

21:47.173 --> 21:49.208
found in Jason Brewer's place--
he thinks there's a chance

21:49.275 --> 21:50.577
they may belong
to Leonard Philbrick.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.844
He says he could
be our backer.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.913
Well, why don't you guys
just run it down, see if you

21:53.980 --> 21:55.915
-can find out where the guy is.
-You don't have to.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.050
I Googled Philbrick's
name on the way here.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.185
He's living in Long Beach.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.220
He teaches
high school math there.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.589
Well, that puts him
right next door

22:02.655 --> 22:04.123
-to the Huntington Tech campus.
-( phone ringing )

22:04.190 --> 22:05.625
Yeah, Eppes.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.194
All right, we're on our way.
Yeah.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.763
LAPD just found Jason Brewer.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.334
MEGAN:
Time of death was

22:15.402 --> 22:17.404
8:00 a.m., and the commuters
heard the shots,

22:17.470 --> 22:18.738
but by the time
they found the body,

22:18.805 --> 22:20.740
it was too late
to lock up the building.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.942
SID said it's
a nine millimeter.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.846
Same kind
that killed Chernov, huh?

22:26.913 --> 22:28.481
Yeah.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.617
Single shot to the head.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.018
No casings were found.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.352
We did find his backpack

22:33.420 --> 22:34.654
in the trash, though.

22:34.721 --> 22:37.223
Phone numbers, addresses,
and this.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.858
Yeah? What's this?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.094
Wow, look at this--

22:42.161 --> 22:44.130
J, K, Q, A...

22:44.196 --> 22:45.765
Jack, King, Queen, Ace.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.701
Some kind of card
sequence list.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.603
Ticket agent remembers
selling Brewer

22:50.670 --> 22:52.505
a one-way bus fare
to Vancouver.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.073
Stuck out because Brewer
didn't have the money.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.142
Older guy paid
for the ticket with cash.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.677
You get a description?

22:57.744 --> 22:58.878
Actually, better than that.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.648
They just ID'd the older guy
that was with Brewer.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.550
Leonard Philbrick?

23:03.616 --> 23:04.717
Same guy Charlie
and Larry pegged

23:04.784 --> 23:06.786
as a possible financial
backer for these kids.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.988
All right, well,
looks like they might be right.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.463
Jason dead?

23:16.529 --> 23:18.565
That's just horrible.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.167
His mother collapsed
when we told her about him.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.035
I can only imagine.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.837
I doubt that.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.839
You don't think I had anything
to do with it?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.575
Well, he was shot
in the head

23:28.641 --> 23:30.877
at a bus station within
30 minutes of you buying him

23:30.943 --> 23:32.545
-a ticket.
-As far as we know,

23:32.612 --> 23:34.881
you were the last person
to see him alive.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.316
I think, uh... I think
I better talk to my lawyer

23:37.383 --> 23:38.751
before we continue this.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.219
Yeah? Why don't you
ask them in there

23:40.286 --> 23:42.455
what they're gonna think
about you recruiting their kids

23:42.522 --> 23:43.790
to hustle cards, Leonard?

23:43.856 --> 23:45.592
We know all about
you, Professor.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.660
About your dreams
of putting your crew together,

23:47.727 --> 23:49.095
about your past gambling debts.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.830
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.264
DON: No?
Well, why do phone records

23:52.331 --> 23:54.266
put you in touch with Brewer,
Chernov, and Nadal

23:54.333 --> 23:55.434
within the last six months?

23:55.502 --> 23:58.571
You finally put together a team,
and now two of them are dead.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.907
I didn't hurt Jason or Yuri.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.342
I could never do

24:03.409 --> 24:04.611
something like that.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.245
Where is Ignacio Nadal?

24:06.312 --> 24:07.379
I don't know.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.281
Is he on the run
from somebody?

24:09.348 --> 24:10.983
Look, these kids--

24:11.050 --> 24:11.984
they came to me.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.987
They found articles I'd written
and a system I developed.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.189
What, you taught 'em, and
you bankrolled 'em, right?

24:17.256 --> 24:18.457
Until last month, yes.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.626
Why? What happened then?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.928
They told me
they found some new backer.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.863
Somebody with substantially
more money.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.932
And you just took that
in stride?

24:25.998 --> 24:27.266
I didn't kill Jason Brewer.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.035
All right, Leonard,
why don't you tell us

24:29.101 --> 24:30.970
what you were doing in
the bus station then?

24:31.037 --> 24:32.004
He needed help.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.873
He was on the run,
and his parents are out of town.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.942
He had nobody that
he could turn to.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.310
I would never do anything
to hurt these kids.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.547
I was their teacher.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.949
MEGAN:
We need to find

24:43.015 --> 24:44.050
Ignacio Nadal.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.552
We put a trace on
his mom's phone.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.786
We're monitoring
his cell provider.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.888
He makes one phone
call, we're on him.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.290
What about friends
or classmates?

24:51.357 --> 24:52.892
Aside from Chernov and Brewer,

24:52.959 --> 24:54.493
this guy's pretty
much a loner.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.162
-Colby?
-Hey, guys.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.196
I think I got something.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.398
Remember that girl the
other night who was with

24:59.465 --> 25:00.633
Ignacio on the tape?

25:00.700 --> 25:02.835
Mm-hmm. Brandi?

25:02.902 --> 25:04.671
-With an "I."
-Yeah.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.305
Check this out. She was not

25:06.372 --> 25:07.373
just with Ignacio.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.341
She was there other nights.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.310
-MEGAN: She's with all
three guys? -Yeah, all of them.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.713
See, I went through
Jason Brewer's address book.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.381
I found her number.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.749
It's her work number anyway.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.251
MEGAN:
The Bareback Club?

25:19.318 --> 25:21.187
She's the main attraction.

25:21.253 --> 25:24.123
So, who do we think
should do that interview?

25:26.358 --> 25:29.061
( hip-hop music playing )

25:37.369 --> 25:40.707
Check out the midday crowd.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.075
COLBY: Looks like a bunch
of dads got separated

25:43.142 --> 25:46.813
from their families on
the bus to Disneyland.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.815
( music continues )

25:51.483 --> 25:54.553
I'm sensing premeditation.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.558
We're looking for Brandi,
and don't start pouring.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.437
I'll tell the DJ
to cut the music.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.005
Whoa, hold on a minute.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.642
One song's not gonna
kill anybody.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.144
Relax, have yourself a soda.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.780
Let the Disneyland dads
have one last look.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.462
Yeah, I was there that night
with Ignacio, but I left early.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.330
So you knew him?

26:38.397 --> 26:39.732
I know a lot of people.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.200
How about people
who get murdered?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.434
Ignacio's dead?

26:42.501 --> 26:44.336
COLBY:
Not yet.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.072
I don't understand.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.473
We saw
the surveillance tapes.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.709
You were there with two
other guys besides Ignacio.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.277
Ignacio's friends.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.611
They're dead.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.013
Oh, my God.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.148
We're trying to make sure
that doesn't happen to Ignacio.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.950
Have you seen him?

26:58.017 --> 26:59.686
Has he tried to call you?

26:59.752 --> 27:02.488
Why'd you leave
early that night?

27:02.554 --> 27:04.957
I had another date?

27:05.024 --> 27:06.492
Did that date have a name?

27:06.558 --> 27:07.894
He's married.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.028
We'll be discreet.

27:09.095 --> 27:12.799
And Ignacio--
was he a date, also?

27:12.865 --> 27:14.566
Not exactly.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.902
Well, then be exactly.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.404
I provide a service.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.040
Not that service.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.709
What, were you their math tutor?

27:22.775 --> 27:25.044
They needed me
to pull off their act.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.046
With me on their arm,
it gave them some credibility.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.682
So you knew
they were counting cards?

27:29.749 --> 27:31.083
Nobody's that lucky.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.584
So, what did you get out
of the deal?

27:32.651 --> 27:34.486
Money.

27:34.553 --> 27:35.922
A lot of money.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.924
Did you notice
anybody following them?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.358
Anybody watching them?

27:39.425 --> 27:42.995
You're up five, ten grand,
people are watching.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.197
I told Ignacio
some day they'd get made.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.801
So you think
that's what happened to them?

27:48.868 --> 27:51.037
Nobody likes to lose money.

28:01.613 --> 28:04.283
Office getting cramped?

28:04.350 --> 28:05.617
Uh, it's being cleaned.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.820
After months battling
the maintenance department,

28:07.887 --> 28:09.088
you know, I gave in.

28:09.155 --> 28:12.458
-How's it going?
-Ugh!

28:12.524 --> 28:13.525
I'm having trouble isolating

28:13.592 --> 28:15.928
the students' gambling
histories, as we discussed.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.229
To find a pattern

28:17.296 --> 28:18.898
that'll yield the identity
of the backer.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.232
Maybe the killer.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.467
No luck so far.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.435
You know, I-I could really
use your help, Larry.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.375
Lawrence.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.010
Hey, did you two know

28:31.077 --> 28:34.380
that Yuri Chernov
was a Tasker Scholar?

28:34.446 --> 28:36.916
He was the first member of
his family to go to college.

28:36.983 --> 28:40.386
Jason Brewer--
his IQ is off the charts.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.154
Ignacio Nadal

28:42.221 --> 28:44.723
may be the most, I don't know,
gifted of them all.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.492
CHARLIE:
Well, don't you take

28:46.558 --> 28:47.827
solace in knowing that clearly,

28:47.894 --> 28:49.261
you're not the only
brilliant thinker

28:49.328 --> 28:50.863
to fall under the allure
of gambling?

28:50.930 --> 28:53.599
I need your brilliant thinking
right now.

28:53.665 --> 28:57.403
I'm-I'm... I-I just can't
make sense of these figures.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.605
If I could be as vague
and opaque as Larry,

28:59.671 --> 29:03.609
I'd say if the new backer
is behind these killings,

29:03.675 --> 29:07.079
then maybe you need to
look behind these numbers.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.149
Yeah, she's right, Charlie.

29:10.216 --> 29:13.920
It's like...
it's like money moves.

29:13.986 --> 29:18.825
Like planets, it's very movement
reveals truths.

29:25.064 --> 29:29.635
You really think
these kids are laundering money?

29:29.701 --> 29:31.470
On a pretty big scale.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.106
So they take money they
couldn't account for legally,

29:34.173 --> 29:36.208
and use gambling
to legitimize it?

29:36.275 --> 29:38.945
They use the card club
as their washing machine.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.347
Look. Look
how the money flow altered

29:41.413 --> 29:43.382
a month ago, when I believe a
new backer came onto the scene.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.418
These kids changed
the way they purchased chips.

29:46.485 --> 29:49.755
And in any 24-hour period,
they never exceeded $10,000.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.790
Right, 'cause they stayed below
the IRS reporting limit.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.993
So there's no record
of the cash they started with,

29:54.060 --> 29:55.895
and a few thousand winnings
doesn't really seem

29:55.962 --> 29:57.063
like a big scam.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.697
That's where they were smart.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.466
We have three students.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.534
Right. With multiple IDs.

30:02.601 --> 30:03.602
CHARLIE:
Which they used

30:03.669 --> 30:06.605
to create three separate
card club player accounts.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.107
So, we have three students

30:08.174 --> 30:10.042
with three separate
player accounts

30:10.109 --> 30:12.278
cashing out $9,900 a night.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.113
That's $89,100 per visit.

30:14.180 --> 30:18.150
Playing six or seven days a week
for a month.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.086
So, that's got to
be at least, what...

30:20.152 --> 30:22.488
I mean, it's over
two million, right?

30:22.554 --> 30:25.491
To be precise, in one month,
that's $2,138,000.

30:25.557 --> 30:28.027
So where's all that money go,
back to the backer?

30:28.094 --> 30:30.096
They wired their money
from the player account

30:30.162 --> 30:31.964
to an offshore account where...

30:32.031 --> 30:33.565
Right, it disappeared.

30:33.632 --> 30:34.967
Unfortunately.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.768
So we can't trace
it to the backer.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.871
This kid Ignacio

30:38.938 --> 30:40.439
is the only one
who can tell us where it is.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.042
Which I'm sure the backer knows,
as well.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.317
* This is it... *

30:51.383 --> 30:53.152
CHARLIE:
You ever been to one of these?

30:53.219 --> 30:55.054
A few times.
My dad's dragged me.

30:55.121 --> 30:56.322
He's into it.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.325
My mom always takes away
his credit cards before we come.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.428
Table six just went
to a plus 18 count.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.695
Is that good?

31:03.762 --> 31:04.897
Oh, yeah.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.298
I've got to tell you,

31:06.365 --> 31:09.501
I'm feeling so uncomfortable
about this.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.769
Larry, all you've been
telling me is

31:10.836 --> 31:12.638
that the only way to understand
this game is to sit

31:12.704 --> 31:14.773
at the blackjack table
and play the game.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.175
Charlie's right, Larry.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.644
The students were doing
very complicated equations

31:18.710 --> 31:19.979
in a high-stress environment.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.313
You know, I need
to feel how they felt.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.648
I need to play how they played.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.749
I-I need you to teach me.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.084
I don't think you understand

31:25.151 --> 31:28.120
just how truly narcotic
this is for me.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.789
Can't you just see this
as-as field work?

31:30.856 --> 31:32.324
Unfortunately,
it is a poppy field.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.394
I'm warning you both,
we're standing at the precipice.

31:35.461 --> 31:38.397
This is the event horizon
of a black hole.

31:38.464 --> 31:41.733
* There's just one place
for me *

31:41.800 --> 31:44.136
* This is it *

31:44.203 --> 31:47.739
* Yeah, just one place to be *

31:47.806 --> 31:50.276
* This is it *

31:50.342 --> 31:52.278
* I'm so happy to be here *

31:52.344 --> 31:54.613
* When I look around,
it's clear *

31:54.680 --> 31:59.451
* Yes, it's perfectly plain
to see *

31:59.518 --> 32:03.489
* There's the cream
of the crop *

32:03.555 --> 32:06.292
* This is it *

32:06.358 --> 32:09.661
* On my list at the top *

32:09.728 --> 32:12.431
* This is it *

32:12.498 --> 32:15.467
* Couldn't ask
for nothing more *

32:15.534 --> 32:17.503
* Like a hope that I adore *

32:17.569 --> 32:19.905
* If there's one place I fit *

32:19.972 --> 32:24.210
* This is it... *

32:24.276 --> 32:27.179
Well, nothing like the sting
of over-oxygenated air

32:27.246 --> 32:28.647
and endless pecuniary promise.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.182
You know, this used to be

32:30.249 --> 32:31.583
about demonstrating the
power of mathematics.

32:31.650 --> 32:32.985
Okay, well,
there is that, too.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.153
I think
we should call it a night.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.321
-What?!
-Yeah, let's get out of here.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.622
How about field research?

32:36.688 --> 32:38.190
Come on, we got table four
over there

32:38.257 --> 32:39.458
just ripe for the picking.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.193
What is he doing
with those cards?

32:41.260 --> 32:43.195
LARRY: Some clubs
introduce a fresh deck

32:43.262 --> 32:44.663
at the dealer shift change.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.965
Just prevents players
from marking the cards.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.234
People actually do that?

32:48.300 --> 32:51.837
I know players who can
cut a multi-deck stack

32:51.903 --> 32:53.639
at exactly 52 cards.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.941
Some players do other feats,
like shuffle-tracking.

32:56.008 --> 32:56.975
Shuffle-tracking?

32:57.043 --> 32:58.010
Yeah, well, no shuffle

32:58.077 --> 32:59.645
by human hand
is exactly perfect.

32:59.711 --> 33:00.646
Some cards remain together.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.181
And the players
who memorize the order

33:02.248 --> 33:03.782
look for those same groupings
in the next shuffle.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.951
That's why they're
using machines now.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.419
How do those machines work?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.555
LARRY: Auto-shufflers, they use
random number generation

33:09.621 --> 33:11.790
to create a random distribution
of cards.

33:11.857 --> 33:12.758
Interesting.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.227
Because what do we know
about random distribution?

33:15.294 --> 33:17.629
It's impossible
for machines to create

33:17.696 --> 33:19.998
truly random sequences.

33:23.102 --> 33:28.207
These kids cracked the code for
how an auto-shuffler shuffles.

33:28.274 --> 33:30.509
The sequences found
in Jason Brewer's notebook

33:30.576 --> 33:32.911
were in fact card-counting
cheat sheets,

33:32.978 --> 33:35.781
exploiting a weakness
in the random number generator

33:35.847 --> 33:37.749
found inside this box.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.451
DAVID: That's the
auto-shuffler we found

33:39.518 --> 33:40.452
in Jason Brewer's apartment.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.453
CHARLIE:
The students used it

33:41.520 --> 33:43.989
to adapt a card skill
called shuffle-tracking.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.257
Yeah, when dealers shuffle,

33:45.324 --> 33:47.326
there are little runs of cards
that stay together.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.528
So the players will
look for them to reappear.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.130
CHARLIE:
And clubs try to prevent this

33:51.197 --> 33:52.331
by using the auto-shuffler.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.933
But, as we all know,
machines aren't perfect.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.935
And the kids took advantage.

33:57.002 --> 33:57.736
How'd they do that?

33:57.803 --> 34:00.439
First, they must have analyzed
this mechanism.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.208
So an auto-shuffler shuffles

34:02.274 --> 34:03.975
using a system
of multiple shelves,

34:04.042 --> 34:07.613
depositing the cards on shelves
in a seemingly random order.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.615
But the shuffles
aren't really random,

34:09.681 --> 34:12.151
because
the random number generator

34:12.218 --> 34:14.019
controlling the auto-shuffler

34:14.086 --> 34:16.555
is governed by
a fixed algorithm.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.490
And these kids
figured all that out?

34:18.557 --> 34:20.058
That's not all they figured out.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.561
This specific card
club had a policy.

34:22.628 --> 34:25.597
On dealer shift changes,
they would introduce new decks,

34:25.664 --> 34:28.700
sealed straight
from the factory.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.436
Now, these cards
are in a preset order.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.538
Now, knowing this staring order,
as well as the algorithm

34:32.604 --> 34:34.140
-enabled these students...
-DAVID: To know the cards

34:34.206 --> 34:36.708
-that were coming before they
were even dealt. -That kind of

34:36.775 --> 34:38.710
math problem is
way beyond our three students.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.446
Their teacher was
Leonard Philbrick.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.080
He had to have helped them.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.115
Oh, he did more than that.

34:43.182 --> 34:45.517
I just got off the phone with
the auto-shuffler company.

34:45.584 --> 34:46.952
Guess who they hired as
their math consultant.

34:47.018 --> 34:47.886
What, Philbrick?

34:47.953 --> 34:49.321
He created the
auto-shuffler's algorithm?

34:49.388 --> 34:52.458
MEGAN: Yeah, which he
could have then given

34:52.524 --> 34:54.493
-to Ignacio and the students,
right? -Which means

34:54.560 --> 34:56.228
that he could have easily
designed an algorithm

34:56.295 --> 34:57.796
that had a much shorter period
to follow.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.898
Thousands of steps,
instead of billions.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.401
Okay, so they were cheating,
which gives the card club

35:02.468 --> 35:03.835
motivation to go after them.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.671
MEGAN: Yeah, but let's not
forget about Philbrick.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.440
All that "I was their teacher"
stuff goes out the window,

35:08.507 --> 35:10.542
if the students stole the scam
and ran with it.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.879
What was I supposed to do,
admit I stole a trade secret?

35:13.945 --> 35:16.282
Used it to cheat a card club
out of thousands?

35:16.348 --> 35:18.650
Would have been a start.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.653
You could have used it as
mitigation at your murder trial.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.389
I told you
I didn't murder anyone.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.291
Yeah, well, Leonard, I'm
guessing you know who did.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.025
One way or another,
you're involved in this,

35:27.092 --> 35:28.126
and you're not telling us, okay?

35:28.194 --> 35:30.362
So I'm telling you, anything
happens to that kid Nadal,

35:30.429 --> 35:31.930
that's three murders
I'm connecting you to.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.131
Do you understand that?

35:34.833 --> 35:39.171
Look, the kids got caught with
the auto-shuffler, all right?

35:39.238 --> 35:40.439
By who?

35:40.506 --> 35:42.174
Marius.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.775
A club manager.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.811
Next thing I know,
he's at my door.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.379
Oh, so the kids gave you up.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.848
I warned them not to get greedy.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.450
Knowing that shuffle,

35:51.517 --> 35:52.518
you can make returns

35:52.584 --> 35:54.786
of 200, even 300 percent
every few hours.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.555
Yeah, but not without
someone noticing.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.657
Marius caught them, day one.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.726
And that's how
the dirty money came in.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.862
He's got connections with drug
distributors on the East Coast.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.931
So you made a deal--

36:05.997 --> 36:07.733
your asses for the
money laundering scam.

36:07.799 --> 36:08.767
What else could we do?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.402
All right.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.170
So what went wrong?

36:12.238 --> 36:13.905
Well, the kids got cold feet.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.441
They wanted to come forward,

36:15.507 --> 36:18.009
admit to the gambling fraud,
the money laundering.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.010
What happened then?

36:19.077 --> 36:20.011
Marius found out?

36:20.078 --> 36:21.680
The recent high roller robberies

36:21.747 --> 36:23.282
presented
a perfect opportunity--

36:23.349 --> 36:24.583
a cover for Yuri's murder.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.786
As for Jason,
Marius must have followed him

36:27.853 --> 36:29.688
when he came to see me.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.823
That's got to mean
Ignacio is next.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.526
I guess he doesn't
want to leave any witnesses.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.675
Hey, FBI.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.877
Where's Marius, the manager?

36:58.384 --> 36:59.385
( sniffs )

36:59.451 --> 37:01.052
Smell that?

37:01.119 --> 37:02.120
Shots fired.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.490
Yeah, here we go.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.458
I got a dead body here.

37:06.525 --> 37:07.826
Lock this place down.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.801
DON:
All right, so Marius

37:15.867 --> 37:16.702
isn't the killer.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.970
So we have to figure out
who would want Marius dead.

37:19.037 --> 37:21.206
Well, how about the people
he was laundering for,

37:21.273 --> 37:23.375
these east coast
drug dealers.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.477
I mean, if you think about it,
Marius got a bunch

37:25.544 --> 37:27.045
of college kids involved
in money laundering,

37:27.112 --> 37:28.113
only he loses control of them.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.382
So what, he killed them all
to keep it quiet?

37:30.449 --> 37:32.017
Obviously he didn't
keep them quiet enough.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.486
Well, we know he's going
after Ignacio next.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.522
Yeah, 'cause he's the one
last witness.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.923
You, why are you so quiet
over there?

37:37.989 --> 37:39.758
It's statement Marius gave
to the LAPD.

37:39.825 --> 37:40.826
The night Yuri Chernov
was murdered,

37:40.892 --> 37:43.729
he says he started work
at 7:00 P.M.

37:43.795 --> 37:44.996
So?

37:45.063 --> 37:46.465
What are all these calls

37:46.532 --> 37:49.468
coming out of his office
first thing in the morning?

37:49.535 --> 37:50.736
Maybe somebody else
was using his office.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.404
COLBY:
Maybe he was just lying.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.872
DON: Yeah, but why
would he lie about that?

37:53.939 --> 37:57.142
Maybe he didn't want anyone
to know he was at the club

37:57.208 --> 37:58.076
when Yuri arrived.

37:58.143 --> 38:00.245
Constrained dynamics, right?

38:00.312 --> 38:01.780
Chernov's car was parked

38:01.847 --> 38:03.782
in a security camera
blind spot, right?

38:03.849 --> 38:06.251
Yeah, the whole corner
was obscured.

38:06.318 --> 38:07.285
All right. Do you have
an overview

38:07.353 --> 38:08.654
of the card club parking lot?

38:11.022 --> 38:13.392
Chernov arrived late afternoon,

38:13.459 --> 38:14.926
well before the evening
crowds showed up.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.562
Why the hell would he park
his car this far away

38:16.628 --> 38:17.796
from the club's entrance?

38:18.964 --> 38:20.832
-That doesn't add up.
-More than that,

38:20.899 --> 38:22.634
it defies mathematical
principles.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.370
Constrained dynamics
is used to analyze

38:24.436 --> 38:25.637
everything from traffic flow

38:25.704 --> 38:26.772
in supermarkets and malls

38:26.838 --> 38:28.507
to the mechanics
of granular matter...

38:28.574 --> 38:30.141
Meanwhile, back
in the parking lot?

38:30.208 --> 38:32.043
Applying constrained dynamics,

38:32.110 --> 38:33.579
the parking lot should have
filled up

38:33.645 --> 38:36.382
in a predictable pattern

38:36.448 --> 38:38.784
starting with the spaces
closest to the entrance

38:38.850 --> 38:41.953
and fanning out like a wave,
like, like a wave.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.855
Given the time
that Yuri arrived,

38:43.922 --> 38:46.825
I see no reason why
he parked his car this far away.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.661
Unless he wasn't the one
who parked there.

38:49.728 --> 38:52.664
-All I did was park his car
-Right.

38:52.731 --> 38:53.965
in the back of an empty lot.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.667
Hey, Willie,
you want to be charged

38:55.734 --> 38:57.569
as an accessory here, huh?

38:57.636 --> 39:01.072
Look, the man
paid me 500 bucks

39:01.139 --> 39:03.074
to park the dude's car
by the fence.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.175
What man? Marius?

39:04.242 --> 39:05.677
Another guy.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.213
But I saw him talking
with Marius that morning.

39:08.279 --> 39:11.817
Before that, he was with
the dude who got whacked.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.219
You're saying the guy that paid
you knew the victim.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.822
Yeah. A Latino dude,
a young guy.

39:16.888 --> 39:20.325
Came to the club all the time
with two friends.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.994
That day he was wearing
a soccer jersey

39:23.061 --> 39:24.763
-and a lot of jewelry.
-and a lot of jewelry.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.765
So Ignacio.

39:26.832 --> 39:31.069
He played both of his friends
and Philbrick and Marius?

39:31.136 --> 39:32.704
And if he's
killing witnesses...

39:32.771 --> 39:34.506
He's got one left.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.091
Philbrick's heading
towards his car.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.695
I've got Philbrick.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.270
Suspect's acquired.
He's moving in.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.171
Where is he?

40:06.237 --> 40:07.338
He's on the other side
of the car.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.507
He's tracking Philbrick.

40:11.142 --> 40:11.943
I got him.

40:13.044 --> 40:13.679
Mr. Philbrick?

40:13.745 --> 40:16.615
If you have a second,
can I talk to you

40:16.682 --> 40:17.749
on my calculus grade?

40:17.816 --> 40:19.150
This is not
a good time, Karen.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.285
But I really need...

40:20.351 --> 40:21.520
Karen, please walk away now!

40:23.088 --> 40:24.823
You guys, move, move!

40:26.625 --> 40:27.626
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.227
Make a move for that gun

40:29.294 --> 40:30.428
and you're dead.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.667
You set me up.

40:35.734 --> 40:36.768
COLBY: Yeah, just like
you set up your friends.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.103
And then you were going
to kill him.

40:38.169 --> 40:39.370
Up to your knees.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.707
Put your hands behind
your head slow.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.441
Why?

40:43.509 --> 40:44.943
Why? Why not?

40:45.010 --> 40:47.546
You told us the money
was there, remember?

40:47.613 --> 40:49.214
All we had to do
was take it.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.383
If Yuri and Jason
hadn't punked on me,

40:52.450 --> 40:54.586
it would have worked out, too.

40:54.653 --> 40:57.723
It looks like you gambled
and lost, pal.

41:02.293 --> 41:06.064
Well, I see once again you've
escaped all responsibility

41:06.131 --> 41:08.033
for your actions.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.067
Oh, Leonard,

41:09.134 --> 41:12.137
you must be very proud
of yourself.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.205
Larry Fleinhardt.

41:14.272 --> 41:17.008
Well, what's it been, 25 years?

41:17.075 --> 41:18.810
22, Leonard.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.513
I see your name in journals.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.481
Academic life
has treated you well.

41:23.549 --> 41:26.184
Well enough.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.453
What are you doing here?

41:28.520 --> 41:30.722
I'm just waiting on you.

41:30.789 --> 41:33.959
How could you do it?

41:34.025 --> 41:36.027
You know what the game
did to us.

41:36.094 --> 41:40.699
How could you visit such a fate
upon young gifted minds?

41:40.766 --> 41:42.768
Those kids came to me.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.102
And instead
of sharing your wisdom,

41:44.169 --> 41:46.972
two are dead and another's going
to prison.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.841
These kids were a second chance
for me.

41:49.908 --> 41:50.842
Come on.

41:50.909 --> 41:53.579
Don't tell me you don't remember
what it felt like

41:53.645 --> 41:56.314
to beat the house
at their own game.

41:56.381 --> 41:59.384
You were the best I ever saw,
Fleinhardt,

41:59.450 --> 42:01.019
and you just walked away.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.087
That's right.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.488
I never looked back.

42:03.555 --> 42:05.023
When the numbers
are running you,

42:05.090 --> 42:06.792
instead of you
running the numbers,

42:06.858 --> 42:08.894
it's time to take your money off
the table, Leonard.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.396
Men make choices they have
to live with.

42:11.462 --> 42:16.001
Well, you know, I know two
who will never get that chance.

42:21.807 --> 42:25.210
So Philbrick cut a deal:
two years probation.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.211
ALAN:
He got lucky.

42:26.277 --> 42:28.446
Oh, yeah, if you want
to call it that.

42:28.513 --> 42:30.782
Again, I apologize
for not coming forward sooner.

42:30.849 --> 42:31.883
Ah, it's all right.

42:31.950 --> 42:33.952
No, I was tormented.
I was mortified.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.353
Look, you stepped up ultimately.

42:35.420 --> 42:36.688
Larry, do you realize

42:36.755 --> 42:37.889
that without your help,
we would have never figured out

42:37.956 --> 42:39.090
those students
were money laundering.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.259
Not to mention
giving Charlie a taste

42:41.326 --> 42:43.028
of real action at the tables.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.696
What are we talking about
blackjack for?

42:44.763 --> 42:46.264
Let's play a real game.

42:46.331 --> 42:47.766
-A real game?
-Poker!

42:47.833 --> 42:49.901
All the math in the world
is useless

42:49.968 --> 42:53.171
against a good read,
steady nerves.

42:53.238 --> 42:54.906
I have had enough action
to last a lifetime.

42:54.973 --> 42:57.375
Besides, poker is for
professional card players

42:57.442 --> 42:59.310
and underemployed celebrities.

42:59.377 --> 43:00.846
DON:
Yeah. I'm out, too, actually.

43:00.912 --> 43:01.880
The last time I played with you,

43:01.947 --> 43:03.048
I ended up eating mac and cheese
for a week.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.349
Come on. We'll go sit outside.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.117
You can tell me about
the gambling days.

43:06.184 --> 43:07.853
Yeah. Yeah.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.421
I guess it's you and me.

43:10.488 --> 43:13.659
Texas Hold 'em, no limit.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.360
What do you say
we bet the house?

43:18.697 --> 43:21.599
You're not, you're not serious
about betting the house.

43:21.667 --> 43:23.735
I'm always serious.
