on the oversight panel
presentation

12:09.816 --> 12:11.731
you're making on Friday,
and I know one person

12:11.774 --> 12:13.776
on the committee--Jean Gilmer.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.300
Lovely woman.
Our families go way back.

12:16.344 --> 12:19.477
I--well, I went ahead
and primed her for your pitch.

12:19.521 --> 12:20.827
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.698
And the good news is,
she was very receptive.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.222
- As she should be.
This is a great program.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.311
- Is there bad news?

12:27.355 --> 12:28.965
- Not necessarily,
but she did say

12:29.009 --> 12:32.795
that one member, Tom Jensen,
is a bit of a stickler

12:32.839 --> 12:34.362
on anything
involving cost increases.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.493
- Oh, no.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.668
- But she thinks
she can sway him

12:36.712 --> 12:37.800
because it's such
a good program.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.194
Her words.
- Okay.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.892
Well, that makes me
feel better.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.764
- Speaking of, Violet,
how's your, uh--

12:44.807 --> 12:46.200
- 110%.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.332
Who needs an appendix anyway?
Not me.

12:48.376 --> 12:51.379
- Good. Good.
We were all worried about you.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.815
- Oh.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.991
[cell phone rings]

12:55.035 --> 12:56.471
- I gotta take this.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.733
Brett, I will see you
at the presentation.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.735
- Yes, you will.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.171
- Hello?

13:01.215 --> 13:02.999
- You know, when Chief Hawkins
first got that job,

13:03.043 --> 13:05.480
I was unimpressed,
but he's growing on me.

13:05.523 --> 13:06.829
- Yeah.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.309
- And the way he made sure
you were taken care of

13:08.352 --> 13:09.658
at the hospital...

13:09.701 --> 13:11.703
- What do you mean?
- He was on those nurses.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.010
Made them get you the best
recovery room in the hospital.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.490
- He did?

13:15.533 --> 13:17.013
- Checked on you more
than once too.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.449
- Oh.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.625
- All right,
I'm gonna look over my binder.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.236
- Okay.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.764
- Hey, Lieutenant?
- Hey, Kylie.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.940
- Chief Boden wants to see you.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.730
- You asking for me, Chief?
- I was, yes.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.515
Take a seat.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.867
Look, I don't like
to mix personal business

13:44.911 --> 13:46.260
and firehouse business,

13:46.303 --> 13:48.349
but I believe I need
to make an exception.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.307
- Okay.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.874
- Stella Kidd.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.920
She was approved furlough
for four weeks.

13:53.963 --> 13:57.053
Now, the fact that she was
taking Girls on Fire

13:57.097 --> 13:59.708
to a new city, that's--

13:59.751 --> 14:02.319
well, that's the Stella Kidd
that I know and appreciate.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.495
- But?

14:04.539 --> 14:06.584
- Four weeks became eight.

14:06.628 --> 14:10.414
Boston became Concord,
became Philadelphia.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.635
Now, I was willing to help her
cover the additional furlough,

14:13.678 --> 14:16.290
but now, after she knew

14:16.333 --> 14:20.729
that we had an open spot
for a truck lieutenant,

14:20.772 --> 14:23.036
she didn't immediately come
and claim it.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.560

14:25.603 --> 14:28.824
So you tell me...

14:28.868 --> 14:31.783
is there something more going
on here that I'm not seeing?

14:33.133 --> 14:35.483
- I appreciate you coming to me
with this, Chief.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.922
I'm in the same boat.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.750
Casey told Stella
he was leaving.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.752
I told her there was
this floater lieutenant

14:43.795 --> 14:45.623
who was impressing everyone,

14:45.667 --> 14:47.495
and it's like
she didn't hear me.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.540
She was so gung-ho
about expanding Girls on Fire

14:49.584 --> 14:52.500
that everything seemed to go
in one ear and out the other.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.460
- Here's the hard truth.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.115
Pelham is
a top-tier lieutenant.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.944

that she really wants this job

15:01.988 --> 15:05.121

when you can, okay?

15:31.321 --> 15:32.932

something like that.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.169
Plus, I want you to look over
some crime scene photos.

over here

Let me see the envelope.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.875
- Not a chance.

16:03.919 --> 16:07.314
Meet me at the Map Room Bar
tonight, 8:00 p.m.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.969

our booth.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.045
- All right. I'll be there.
- I'm so excited.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.047
Okay, we need a slogan
when we hand out the beers.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.093
Like, um, "Fire up your night"

16:47.136 --> 16:49.530
or, "We'll put the fire
in your belly."

will succeed here in Chicago.

Thank you for your time.

I appreciate your enthusiasm
for the program,

35:36.917 --> 35:38.266
but I don't think
this is the right time

35:38.310 --> 35:40.181

to be incurring--

35:40.225 --> 35:41.835

So sorry I'm late.
I'd appreciate it

36:01.550 --> 36:03.161
that I've seen the benefits

36:03.204 --> 36:05.902
of Sylvie Brett's program
firsthand.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.426
And as I'm sure
she laid out for you,

36:07.469 --> 36:09.471
she's reducing
non-emergency calls,

36:09.515 --> 36:11.865
but more importantly,
she's spending more time

36:11.908 --> 36:14.259
with her patients
and promoting wellness

36:14.302 --> 36:16.348
and mental health awareness
while she's there.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.480
I could go on
for hours about it,

36:18.524 --> 36:21.918
but rather than hear from me,

36:21.962 --> 36:24.182
why not hear about
the difference this program

36:24.225 --> 36:27.446
makes from the patients
whom it benefits?

36:34.279 --> 36:37.282

My name is Cheryl Reddings,

36:37.325 --> 36:43.375

in the paramedicine program.

came into my life,

I called 911 two
or three times a week.

without this program.
