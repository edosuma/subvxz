02:00.105 --> 02:01.855
Smile.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.050
I'm just looking for a sense.

02:09.095 --> 02:10.699
And what kind of a sense
are you looking for?

02:10.750 --> 02:12.520
- A sense of when.
- When what?

02:12.570 --> 02:15.720
- You know what.
- Oh, you mean the wedding?

02:15.770 --> 02:18.560
I'm just looking for a season, honey,
because if it's spring, then...

02:18.610 --> 02:20.560
Mom, we're figuring it out.

02:20.610 --> 02:22.810
Fine, fine. I withdraw.

02:22.860 --> 02:24.445
Here you go, ladies.

02:24.495 --> 02:28.065
Oh, I'm so sorry, but I ordered
this without the walnuts.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.070
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.870
<i>- Let me take care of that.</i>
- Thank you.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.705
- I did say no walnuts?
- You sure did, yeah.

02:36.375 --> 02:38.580
Let me pay for the wedding.

02:38.630 --> 02:40.745
You are relentless.

02:40.795 --> 02:42.965
- Look who's talking.
- I'm not relentless.

02:43.015 --> 02:45.550
Megan, you're the most relentless
person I've ever known.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.870
When you have a cause,
there's no stopping you.

02:50.475 --> 02:51.840
I can't let you pay.

02:51.890 --> 02:53.810
Why not? I treat you all the time.

02:53.860 --> 02:56.645
- I treated you to those boots.
- What boots?

02:56.695 --> 02:58.980
Those boots that
you saw at Bergdorf's.

02:59.030 --> 03:02.020
I didn't have my wallet and I
said I would pay you back.

03:02.070 --> 03:05.270
Well, that was March.
This is October.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.725
Megan, no. Forget it. Please, no.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.040
Do you remember how much they were?

03:09.085 --> 03:10.775
- Megan, forget it.
- I think it was 400.

03:10.825 --> 03:12.445
No, honey, I don't want your money.

03:12.495 --> 03:14.580
- I insist.
<i>- Fine, fine.</i>

03:14.630 --> 03:16.830
What's today? October what?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.450
The 13th.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.085
But 13 is unlucky. Date it tomorrow.

03:21.135 --> 03:24.005
October 14.

03:30.730 --> 03:32.680
Thank you for the loan.

03:32.730 --> 03:36.685
So once I deposit this, you'll
let me pay for the wedding?

03:38.185 --> 03:40.940
Oh, I just thought of something
that I have to tell you.

03:40.990 --> 03:43.475
I really have to pee.
Is it gonna take a while?

03:43.525 --> 03:45.310
A minute or two.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.980
Fine. Go, go, go.

03:48.030 --> 03:50.650
- But don't let me forget.
- I'll be right back.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.785
And ladies don't say pee.

04:06.815 --> 04:09.265
That's better.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.055
Hey, now that is
some pretty nifty singing.

05:36.105 --> 05:37.475
Give yourselves a hand.

05:37.525 --> 05:40.060
<i>All right.</i>

05:40.110 --> 05:42.530
<i>Hey, folks, thanks
for coming out to visit us.</i>

05:42.580 --> 05:46.280
Please forgive us as we're a little
rough around the edges right now.

05:46.330 --> 05:48.820
We've only been up and running
for a couple of months.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.155
<i>On your left as you get off,</i>

05:51.205 --> 05:53.540
<i>there'll be golf carts
and audio tours.</i>

05:53.590 --> 05:56.375
And please make sure we see
those wristbands at all times.

05:56.425 --> 05:58.830
<i>Now, the park closes at sundown.</i>

05:58.880 --> 06:00.995
So if you ain't on that last bus,

06:01.045 --> 06:02.665
we're gonna come hunt you down.

06:02.715 --> 06:05.180
<i>Welcome to Miracle. Come on!</i>

06:07.635 --> 06:09.805
We're not doing the audio tour.

06:09.855 --> 06:12.355
Oh, hell, yes, we are.

06:16.195 --> 06:18.315
<i>It's pretty
common for folks to get confused</i>

06:18.365 --> 06:21.515
<i>about where you've come to visit
today, so let's clear it up.</i>

06:21.565 --> 06:26.270
<i>The moment you cross the bridge,
you enter the town of Jarden.</i>

06:26.320 --> 06:30.275
<i>Miracle is the national park that
surrounds and protects that town</i>

06:30.325 --> 06:33.830
<i>from those who would corrupt
its exceptional properties.</i>

06:33.880 --> 06:37.250
<i>Historic site number seven.</i>

06:37.300 --> 06:39.585
<i>Some say the earthquakes
that occur in Jarden</i>

06:39.635 --> 06:41.535
<i>are a result of man-made fracking</i>

06:41.585 --> 06:44.375
<i>and wastewater disposal
in nearby towns.</i>

06:44.425 --> 06:47.545
<i>But this crack in the street
wasn't caused by a quake.</i>

06:47.595 --> 06:50.545
<i>It was the result of a gas
explosion in the sewage system</i>

06:50.595 --> 06:53.850
<i>on October the 14
that sent manhole covers</i>

06:53.900 --> 06:55.770
<i>flying a few blocks over.</i>

06:55.820 --> 06:57.635
<i>Instead of repairing the damage,</i>

06:57.685 --> 07:00.340
<i>the town has left it as a reminder.</i>

07:01.435 --> 07:02.435
_

07:02.480 --> 07:04.395
<i>Historic site number 13.</i>

07:04.445 --> 07:06.645
<i>This is Cecilia's place.</i>

07:06.695 --> 07:08.865
<i>It turns out that the gown
she tried on that afternoon</i>

07:08.915 --> 07:10.735
<i>wasn't even her cup of tea.</i>

07:10.785 --> 07:14.235
<i>Then when she heard what happened
around the world on October the 14,</i>

07:14.285 --> 07:16.290
<i>she bought it immediately.</i>

07:16.340 --> 07:19.375
<i>And to this day,
Cecilia still wears that dress</i>

07:19.425 --> 07:22.580
<i>for a few hours just in case.</i>

07:22.630 --> 07:25.130
Y'all want a picture?

07:25.180 --> 07:27.215
Oh, we're good.

07:27.265 --> 07:28.635
Thank you.

07:28.685 --> 07:31.005
Let's go. Let's go.

07:31.055 --> 07:33.270
Nice dress.

07:44.450 --> 07:46.235
There's no number.
Why are you stopping?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.990
There's a man in there
who can help me.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.495
Jesus, Meg.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.785
Another psychic?

08:00.835 --> 08:02.585
I've heard amazing things about him.

08:02.635 --> 08:04.835
This is why we took a road
trip to Texas, this guy?

08:04.885 --> 08:07.340
He's only been doing
readings for a few weeks

08:07.390 --> 08:09.220
and they say that he's the real deal.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.100
I want you to find
what you're looking for, I do.

08:16.150 --> 08:19.515
How's this guy gonna be any
different from any of the others?

08:20.735 --> 08:23.320
Because this place is different.

08:24.525 --> 08:27.140
It's special.

08:27.190 --> 08:29.275
And he's from here.

08:30.945 --> 08:33.565
So...

08:33.615 --> 08:37.034
she died the day
before the Departure?

08:37.085 --> 08:39.320
Uh-huh.

08:39.370 --> 08:41.455
Oh.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.710
Honey, I'm really sorry.

08:47.210 --> 08:49.880
It was two years ago. I'm okay.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.800
People say I'm lucky.

08:54.855 --> 08:56.470
How's that?

08:57.555 --> 09:00.090
That I know what happened to her,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.225
where she went.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.265
Wow.

09:04.315 --> 09:06.150
You lose your mama

09:06.200 --> 09:10.350
and the very next day nobody
gives a shit about her or you

09:10.400 --> 09:13.070
because they think
the world is ending.

09:14.575 --> 09:16.625
Lucky.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.410
<i>Please, have a seat.</i>

09:20.460 --> 09:23.045
<i>Make yourself comfortable, please.</i>

09:25.250 --> 09:27.120
You need my handprint?

09:27.170 --> 09:31.955
No, that is for people
who want to know their future.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.755
You don't want to do that.

09:40.815 --> 09:42.885
I brought one of her sweaters.

09:42.935 --> 09:45.185
Chilly?

09:45.235 --> 09:48.475
No, I... I just...

09:48.525 --> 09:50.610
I mean, the others

09:50.660 --> 09:52.645
wanted something
that belonged to her.

09:52.695 --> 09:54.565
<i>Well, Miss Abbott,</i>

09:54.615 --> 09:56.865
I don't need anything from her.

09:58.950 --> 10:01.000
But...

10:02.455 --> 10:04.505
I need something from you.

10:09.095 --> 10:10.545
Just chew that.

10:10.595 --> 10:13.880
It's safe. Don't swallow it.

10:24.975 --> 10:27.145
Here, just spit it here.

10:27.195 --> 10:28.765
In your hand?

10:28.815 --> 10:30.730
Yeah, in my hand.

10:42.295 --> 10:44.660
Mm...

10:53.090 --> 10:54.720
What do you want to know?

10:56.010 --> 10:58.045
You can just ask her?

10:58.095 --> 11:00.425
You can ask me.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.680
What do you want to know?

11:05.935 --> 11:08.970
She was gonna tell me something

11:09.020 --> 11:13.190
just before I got up from the
table to go to the bathroom.

11:14.525 --> 11:16.730
I want to know what it was,

11:16.780 --> 11:19.030
what she was gonna tell me.

11:24.035 --> 11:26.620
You know,

11:26.670 --> 11:29.240
people on their deathbeds,

11:29.290 --> 11:32.295
they have a chance to put
their last words together,

11:32.345 --> 11:33.410
make them count.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.180
Say something profound, poetic.

11:39.220 --> 11:42.805
But usually when folk don't
know that they're about to die,

11:42.855 --> 11:45.725
they... well,

11:45.775 --> 11:49.395
no disrespect to your mother
or anything, Miss Abbott,

11:49.445 --> 11:51.345
they say a lot of stupid shit.

11:51.395 --> 11:54.350
What do you mean?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.685
I can tell you what you want,

11:56.735 --> 12:01.440
but I've been doing this
long enough to know that

12:01.490 --> 12:03.690
no matter what I say,

12:03.740 --> 12:05.360
you're gonna be disappointed

12:05.410 --> 12:08.410
because it's not gonna fix
what's broke inside.

12:12.385 --> 12:14.670
Bullshit.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.040
Sorry?

12:16.090 --> 12:18.205
You don't know.

12:18.255 --> 12:20.425
You're not fucking real.

12:20.475 --> 12:22.095
I'm gonna be disappointed

12:22.145 --> 12:24.130
because whatever it is
that you're about to tell me

12:24.180 --> 12:26.265
- is fucking bullshit.
- Walnuts.

12:28.235 --> 12:29.885
What?

12:29.935 --> 12:32.890
Your mother sent her salad back

12:32.940 --> 12:36.020
because she asked for no walnuts.

12:37.575 --> 12:40.025
She was very polite about it, though.

12:45.615 --> 12:48.085
Are you sure you want to know?

12:53.625 --> 12:55.460
Tell me.

13:11.945 --> 13:13.845
<i>Well?</i>

13:13.895 --> 13:16.145
He wasn't the real deal.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.500
<i>All right, folks, five minutes.</i>

13:37.550 --> 13:40.505
<i>We've got five minutes
till the first bus gets here.</i>

14:13.620 --> 14:14.920
Want a baby carrot?

14:17.710 --> 14:20.160
What?

14:20.210 --> 14:23.130
You can't cry while you eat
them. It's impossible.

14:36.860 --> 14:38.860
Thanks.

14:45.735 --> 14:48.325
<i>Folks, please
make sure your vendor number</i>

14:48.375 --> 14:51.710
<i>is clear and visible at your stalls.</i>

14:59.050 --> 15:00.835
Is it working?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.590
Shit.

15:07.175 --> 15:10.345
I would tell you a joke,
but I don't know any.

15:10.395 --> 15:12.295
<i>All right, folks, two minutes.</i>

15:12.345 --> 15:15.515
<i>We have two minutes
till the first bus.</i>

15:15.565 --> 15:16.935
Knock, knock.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.140
Who's there?

15:21.190 --> 15:23.775
Broken pencil.

15:24.945 --> 15:27.360
Broken pencil who?

15:28.530 --> 15:30.945
Never mind. It's pointless.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.740
I'm Evie.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.960
Meg.

16:01.530 --> 16:04.530
I'm sorry you didn't find whatever
you were looking for here.

16:05.985 --> 16:07.900
No one ever does.

16:25.005 --> 16:26.670
<i>Who was that?</i>

16:31.975 --> 16:34.095
She gave me some carrots.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.350
Let's get out of here.

16:41.755 --> 16:43.290
<i>Let's go ahead forward, folks.</i>

16:43.340 --> 16:44.725
<i>We'll be leaving in two minutes.</i>

16:44.775 --> 16:46.320
<i>Two minutes.</i>

17:53.340 --> 17:55.795
<i>Hey, no! Let me go!</i>

17:55.845 --> 17:57.810
What did we do?

18:25.375 --> 18:27.575
Let us out!

18:27.625 --> 18:29.790
_

20:11.970 --> 20:14.135
_

20:15.735 --> 20:17.865
What about the bus?

20:25.460 --> 20:27.780
If you want to have a conversation,

20:27.830 --> 20:30.130
let's just have a conversation.

20:35.085 --> 20:39.840
We thought we had an understanding
after the incident with the dogs.

20:39.890 --> 20:43.010
But a school bus, Megan?

20:43.060 --> 20:45.465
We don't target children.

20:45.515 --> 20:48.715
Why not? Nobody got hurt.

20:48.765 --> 20:52.055
For the same reason we don't allow
them to live in our houses.

20:52.105 --> 20:53.805
The authorities would overreact.

20:53.855 --> 20:55.975
We stone each other to death,

20:56.025 --> 20:58.690
but we're afraid of the authorities?

21:00.110 --> 21:01.980
Please, can you explain that to me?

21:02.030 --> 21:04.615
Explanations are useless.

21:04.665 --> 21:07.900
Don't give me
that mysterious bullshit.

21:07.950 --> 21:10.205
That's what you say to them.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.960
I've been inside for almost a
year now and I need to know.

21:15.010 --> 21:18.415
<i>- Need to know what?</i>
- Why we're not fucking stepping it up.

21:18.465 --> 21:20.215
They're forgetting.

21:22.385 --> 21:25.470
And if I'm supposed
to be a living reminder,

21:25.520 --> 21:28.805
it's not enough for me to stand
outside of their fucking houses

21:28.855 --> 21:32.310
staring at them until they
start screaming in my face.

21:33.445 --> 21:35.145
<i>Why do I have to just stand there</i>

21:35.195 --> 21:38.685
when I can put my cigarette
out in their fucking eye?

21:38.735 --> 21:41.150
That's a reminder.

21:48.495 --> 21:51.995
Violence is weakness.

21:52.965 --> 21:54.545
You're wrong.

21:56.635 --> 22:00.000
And I'm not the only one
that feels that way.

22:01.505 --> 22:05.090
Are you contacting the heads
of other houses again, Megan?

22:06.010 --> 22:08.765
Why would I be doing that?

22:08.815 --> 22:11.685
There are rumors

22:11.735 --> 22:15.935
you're planning your own
action on October 14.

22:18.105 --> 22:20.860
I'm not authorized
to plan my own action.

22:20.910 --> 22:25.860
Just like you're not trying to
purchase plastic explosives?

22:28.750 --> 22:30.900
That's ridiculous.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.285
It is ridiculous, Megan.

22:36.005 --> 22:39.660
So I take it you and your house

22:39.710 --> 22:42.995
will be present at the
Heroes Day celebration

22:43.045 --> 22:45.300
in Dobbs Ferry?

22:45.350 --> 22:47.500
Absolutely.

22:47.550 --> 22:50.505
We've been painting
our signs all week.

22:53.440 --> 22:57.895
You will be in Dobbs Ferry
with your members

22:57.945 --> 23:01.350
and you will carry out the action.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.785
Mm-hmm.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.820
I need to hear you say it.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.660
You can count on me.

23:14.330 --> 23:16.410
Can we, Megan?

23:17.665 --> 23:20.415
Because we counted
on you to handle this.

23:22.420 --> 23:26.290
We lost 10 members from
New Rochelle last week.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.340
Apparently he's hugging
their pain away.

23:37.435 --> 23:40.140
I wanted to do what he could do.

23:40.190 --> 23:42.975
I wanted to be something.

23:43.025 --> 23:44.390
So I said yes.

23:44.440 --> 23:48.395
And he wrapped his arms around me

23:48.445 --> 23:52.400
and I felt everything I was,
everything I would be.

23:52.450 --> 23:55.235
I felt it get born and die

23:55.285 --> 23:57.740
over and over again.

23:57.790 --> 24:00.040
I had been afraid to use it.

24:00.090 --> 24:01.755
Afraid of...

24:05.630 --> 24:07.295
Afraid of what it meant.

24:10.970 --> 24:13.135
Of what came next.

24:14.690 --> 24:16.810
But I knew I couldn't
let you hurt anymore,

24:16.860 --> 24:19.225
not if I can take it away.

24:22.615 --> 24:24.615
I'm not afraid anymore.

24:29.455 --> 24:31.035
So...

24:37.960 --> 24:39.710
who wants a hug?

24:51.730 --> 24:53.740
_

24:54.310 --> 24:55.965
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:56.015 --> 24:59.465
- What's your name?
- Kristin.

24:59.515 --> 25:02.020
Do you want me to take
your pain away, Kristin?

25:20.455 --> 25:22.370
Thank you.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.330
Hi.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.380
What's your name?

25:37.770 --> 25:39.720
It's Meg, right?

25:43.895 --> 25:46.445
Do you want me to take
your pain away, Meg?

26:13.760 --> 26:16.340
I can do this for real.

26:40.785 --> 26:42.905
<i>Hey.</i>

26:42.955 --> 26:45.240
Did you forget about Paramus?

26:45.290 --> 26:47.910
I had 30 people there
waiting to see you.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.745
I tried to call you.
You didn't pick up.

26:49.795 --> 26:51.460
I had to give their donations back.

26:53.465 --> 26:56.215
- Donations?
- What?

26:56.265 --> 26:59.335
You mean their money?

26:59.385 --> 27:01.255
You had to give their money back.

27:01.305 --> 27:03.705
Well, we're gonna need money if we're
ever gonna get the permanent space.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.560
- We don't need a permanent space.
- Yes, we do, Tommy.

27:06.610 --> 27:09.595
It's been a month and renting out
these halls is very expensive.

27:09.645 --> 27:12.900
I don't want their money and I don't
want to build a fucking church.

27:12.950 --> 27:16.855
When they pay us, that is their
commitment to change, okay?

27:16.905 --> 27:19.105
If it were free, it wouldn't work.

27:19.155 --> 27:22.075
- We're helping people.
- We?

27:22.125 --> 27:24.160
<i>I'm the one up here lying.</i>

27:24.210 --> 27:26.195
You're not lying.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.915
We stole it, Mom.

27:28.965 --> 27:32.335
You said that if we took
Wayne's story and used it,

27:32.385 --> 27:34.455
<i>people would believe in us
the way they believed in him.</i>

27:34.505 --> 27:37.625
Well, they're getting better.
Isn't that what matters?

27:37.675 --> 27:38.925
It works!

27:41.395 --> 27:43.595
It doesn't work on me.

27:47.070 --> 27:49.555
Did something happen?

27:49.605 --> 27:52.025
Yeah.

27:52.075 --> 27:54.140
Something happened.

27:54.190 --> 27:56.560
Your book didn't work out,
so you figured...

27:56.610 --> 27:59.945
you figured you would pimp
out your own fucking son

27:59.995 --> 28:03.450
<i>so that you wouldn't have
to run people over anymore.</i>

28:05.170 --> 28:07.155
So that you didn't have to feel bad

28:07.205 --> 28:09.905
about leaving your
whole fucking family.

28:15.095 --> 28:17.500
I'm sorry.

28:17.550 --> 28:19.635
I'm so sorry.

28:19.685 --> 28:21.435
Tommy, I'm so sorry.

28:22.970 --> 28:25.340
Tommy. Tommy, please.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.610
I'm sorry.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.590
Stay.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.960
Hey, everybody!

29:37.010 --> 29:38.795
Remember me?

29:38.845 --> 29:40.965
I was here a month ago

29:41.015 --> 29:43.085
trying to recruit you.

29:43.135 --> 29:44.920
I just wanted you to come get better

29:44.970 --> 29:48.055
with some great group
therapy from my mommy.

29:49.140 --> 29:50.475
You!

29:50.525 --> 29:53.425
You. I tried to recruit you.

29:53.475 --> 29:55.930
You looked so sad.

29:55.980 --> 29:57.930
Then you blew
your fucking whistle at me.

29:57.980 --> 30:00.520
You blew the whistle
and they came and put me

30:00.570 --> 30:02.770
in a fucking van
that brought me to Meg.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.820
Hmm?

30:04.870 --> 30:07.275
Meg. You know Meg?

30:07.325 --> 30:08.775
You know Meg?

30:08.825 --> 30:11.580
You know Meg, huh?

30:11.630 --> 30:14.780
You know her? Where's your whistle?

30:14.830 --> 30:16.250
Where's your whistle?!

30:16.300 --> 30:18.035
Where's your fucking whistle?

30:18.085 --> 30:19.455
Where is it?

30:19.505 --> 30:21.005
Blow your fucking whistle!

30:21.055 --> 30:23.090
Blow the whistle that brings Meg.

30:23.140 --> 30:25.125
Where is she?

30:25.175 --> 30:27.925
Where the fuck is Meg?

31:01.510 --> 31:03.545
What do you want?

31:05.550 --> 31:07.500
You said you could do it for real.

31:07.550 --> 31:09.335
Do what?

31:09.385 --> 31:12.055
Take my pain away.

31:29.905 --> 31:32.325
Why don't you just hug yourself?

31:36.965 --> 31:38.530
Please.

31:38.580 --> 31:41.335
I'll do anything. I just
want to be a part of this.

31:43.505 --> 31:46.675
You don't understand this.

31:46.725 --> 31:48.840
You're not looking for this.

31:50.930 --> 31:52.845
You're looking for a family.

31:52.895 --> 31:56.565
If I wanted a fucking
family, I'd move to Texas.

31:57.735 --> 31:59.185
What?

31:59.235 --> 32:00.855
Texas.

32:00.905 --> 32:03.520
They moved there,
my dad and my sister.

32:06.445 --> 32:08.445
Where in Texas?

32:08.495 --> 32:10.945
Miracle.

32:12.785 --> 32:14.900
Jarden.

32:14.950 --> 32:17.240
<i>What?</i>

32:17.290 --> 32:20.090
The town is Jarden.

32:21.625 --> 32:24.580
Miracle is the national park

32:24.630 --> 32:26.465
that surrounds and protects it

32:26.515 --> 32:30.465
from those who would corrupt
its exceptional properties.

32:32.470 --> 32:35.770
I just so happen to be
headed there myself.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.985
My phone's in the glove compartment.

33:36.035 --> 33:37.785
Get it for me.

33:42.255 --> 33:44.675
Yeah?

33:46.460 --> 33:48.830
How many?

33:48.880 --> 33:50.965
Yeah, okay. Good.

33:52.885 --> 33:56.005
I'm gonna need
to see the bridge myself.

33:56.055 --> 33:58.555
<i>No, no, alone.</i>

33:58.605 --> 34:00.720
<i>I'll be there in the morning.</i>

34:13.955 --> 34:17.105
This is hard, huh?

34:17.155 --> 34:20.530
Not knowing what's gonna happen.

34:20.580 --> 34:24.245
You must be curious about what I'm
gonna do when we get to Texas.

34:26.335 --> 34:28.085
Are you, Tom?

34:29.335 --> 34:30.920
'Cause it's pretty fucking amazing

34:30.969 --> 34:32.719
what I'm gonna do.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.600
Why'd you fuck me?

34:47.070 --> 34:49.025
I know why you poured gasoline on me.

34:49.074 --> 34:50.389
I know why you threatened me,

34:50.440 --> 34:52.574
to try to send a message to my mom.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.365
But why did you fuck me?

35:03.370 --> 35:05.155
Oh, look.

35:05.205 --> 35:08.075
A honky-tonk.

35:08.125 --> 35:10.175
<i>You wanna go dancing, Tom?</i>

35:17.885 --> 35:19.600
Thank you.

35:27.395 --> 35:29.145
Mmm.

35:30.195 --> 35:31.945
Your turn.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.450
If you're not gonna drink...

35:41.160 --> 35:42.825
Now we're talking.

35:47.165 --> 35:49.200
So who's the blonde?

35:49.250 --> 35:51.535
What?

35:51.585 --> 35:54.420
Both your parents have dark hair.

35:54.470 --> 35:56.340
You know my dad?

35:56.390 --> 35:59.045
The former chief.

35:59.095 --> 36:00.760
Nice guy.

36:00.810 --> 36:04.215
Yeah, he's not my biological father.

36:04.265 --> 36:06.765
- But he raised you, right?
- Yeah.

36:06.815 --> 36:09.605
Yeah, he and my mother
got together when I was four.

36:09.655 --> 36:12.975
- He adopted me.
- Oh, yeah?

36:13.025 --> 36:17.360
My dad died when I was a baby.

36:17.410 --> 36:20.610
Then my mom got remarried
to this guy Elliot.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.535
He wanted us to be
an official family.

36:25.585 --> 36:27.490
I was really young, but I remember

36:27.540 --> 36:30.155
going down to the
courthouse and everything.

36:30.205 --> 36:32.660
The judge gave me a lollipop.

36:34.545 --> 36:36.595
Good old Elliot.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.385
He left my mom a year later

36:39.435 --> 36:42.215
and I never saw him again.

36:44.555 --> 36:46.605
<i>Can we get two more?</i>

36:48.025 --> 36:49.890
<i>- Please?</i>
- You got it.

36:56.450 --> 36:58.815
- Thank you.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

37:00.370 --> 37:02.620
So where's your mom now?

37:04.290 --> 37:06.375
She's in space.

37:07.545 --> 37:08.910
What?

37:08.960 --> 37:11.580
When she died, we had her cremated

37:11.630 --> 37:14.750
and we shot her ashes into space.

37:18.005 --> 37:19.755
Seriously?

37:19.805 --> 37:22.375
She didn't like the idea
of being in a box,

37:22.425 --> 37:25.545
you know, in the ground.

37:25.595 --> 37:28.880
And she was really into astrology.

37:28.930 --> 37:32.555
There's this company and they do it.

37:32.605 --> 37:35.555
Costs $12,000.

37:35.605 --> 37:37.990
Seems reasonable, right?

37:48.335 --> 37:51.405
What's happening right now?

39:00.740 --> 39:03.475
This feels nice, right?

39:03.525 --> 39:05.645
Yeah.

39:05.695 --> 39:07.695
It feels nice.

39:19.875 --> 39:22.210
To get you pregnant.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.000
What?

39:27.050 --> 39:30.135
I wanted to get you pregnant.

39:32.890 --> 39:35.010
That's why I fucked you, Tom.

40:28.945 --> 40:30.660
Nice to see you again.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.630
Open the chain.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.665
Just fucking tell me.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.250
Somebody got on the property.

41:37.765 --> 41:40.800
Come on. Just let me go.

41:40.850 --> 41:43.470
I didn't do anything.

41:43.520 --> 41:47.025
There's a bike trail about
a mid the property.

41:47.075 --> 41:49.325
<i>Guess he decided to go off it.</i>

41:51.580 --> 41:53.315
Where'd you find him?

41:53.365 --> 41:55.830
Right outside the barn.

41:58.535 --> 42:00.785
Did he see?

42:02.255 --> 42:04.205
Yeah, we think so.

42:04.255 --> 42:07.960
What? What did I see?
I didn't see anything.

42:08.010 --> 42:10.345
I don't know even know
what you're talking about.

42:14.185 --> 42:17.085
We can just keep him
here until tomorrow.

42:17.135 --> 42:19.605
Once it's over,
it won't matter anymore.

42:24.060 --> 42:25.895
Stone him.

42:28.315 --> 42:30.265
What does that... what did she say?

42:30.315 --> 42:32.185
What does that mean?

42:32.235 --> 42:35.155
Hey! Wait, guys!

42:35.205 --> 42:37.190
<i>Please, just let me go!</i>

42:37.240 --> 42:39.740
<i>Please! Just let me go!</i>

42:47.135 --> 42:48.835
Hey.

42:51.970 --> 42:53.790
What are you doing?

42:53.840 --> 42:56.125
I was following you.

42:56.175 --> 42:59.095
<i>I don't want you to follow me.</i>

43:01.400 --> 43:03.885
You wanted to come here,
and you're here.

43:03.935 --> 43:05.850
And now we're done.

43:07.020 --> 43:09.320
So what am I supposed to do?

43:15.495 --> 43:17.280
Make yourself useful.

43:20.615 --> 43:22.905
<i>Let me go!</i>

43:22.955 --> 43:24.620
<i>Please, let me go!</i>

43:24.670 --> 43:27.575
Come on! I didn't do anything!

43:27.625 --> 43:31.295
<i>- No! I didn't fucking do anything!</i>

43:31.345 --> 43:33.915
<i>Please!</i>

43:33.965 --> 43:35.715
<i>Stop! I'll do anything!</i>

43:35.765 --> 43:37.465
<i>You don't have to do this!</i>

43:37.515 --> 43:39.000
<i>Please! No!</i>

43:39.050 --> 43:40.805
Let me go!

43:40.855 --> 43:43.805
Please! Please!

43:43.855 --> 43:48.070
<i>No! Come on!</i>

44:29.110 --> 44:30.650
_

44:49.600 --> 44:51.850
_

46:38.360 --> 46:39.810
<i>Megan?</i>

46:49.220 --> 46:51.840
My God, what are you doing here?

46:53.875 --> 46:55.245
It's Matt.

46:55.295 --> 46:57.745
Matt Jamison from Mapleton.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.915
Oh, yeah.

47:01.965 --> 47:03.835
The priest.

47:04.970 --> 47:07.420
- You're talking.

47:07.470 --> 47:09.210
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

47:09.260 --> 47:11.975
So you left them, the Remnant?

47:13.145 --> 47:14.845
I sure did.

47:16.850 --> 47:18.315
Good for you.

47:20.350 --> 47:23.805
So Kevin and Nora have
been taking care of Mary

47:23.855 --> 47:27.025
and I'm immensely grateful for that.

47:27.075 --> 47:30.075
So the rangers just won't let you in?

47:31.280 --> 47:33.815
Their rules are very particular.

47:33.865 --> 47:36.820
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

47:36.870 --> 47:38.670
No, it doesn't.

47:40.955 --> 47:43.460
I can't get over it.

47:43.510 --> 47:44.910
What?

47:44.960 --> 47:48.130
Well, seeing you here in Texas.

47:48.180 --> 47:49.380
What?

47:49.430 --> 47:52.180
It's pretty amazing, don't you think?

47:53.185 --> 47:54.805
Not really.

47:54.855 --> 47:58.225
I mean, if we were just anywhere,
it would be a coincidence,

47:58.275 --> 48:03.010
but we're here in Miracle.

48:03.060 --> 48:05.895
I think we both came here
for the same reason.

48:08.285 --> 48:10.315
What reason is that?

48:11.785 --> 48:14.320
Because this place is safe.

48:16.910 --> 48:18.945
Now that you've left the Remnant.

48:18.995 --> 48:21.330
Exactly.

48:21.380 --> 48:24.835
It was really hard
to get away, you know,

48:24.885 --> 48:26.835
because they're everywhere.

48:28.720 --> 48:31.375
But I started to think to myself,

48:31.425 --> 48:32.635
there must be somewhere

48:32.680 --> 48:35.710
that the Guilty Remnant
wouldn't work, you know?

48:35.760 --> 48:37.510
Wouldn't work?

48:37.560 --> 48:40.715
Right, because in order
to get someone to join them,

48:40.765 --> 48:43.970
that person needs be in pain.

48:44.020 --> 48:46.220
And the people on the other
side of that bridge,

48:46.270 --> 48:48.190
Matt, they were spared.

48:49.690 --> 48:52.945
They're just not suffering
like the rest of us are.

48:58.950 --> 49:00.820
You know, Megan,

49:00.870 --> 49:04.005
I don't think you're being
entirely honest with me.

49:06.925 --> 49:09.760
You think I'd lie to a priest?

49:13.380 --> 49:16.420
Today is the anniversary, isn't it?

49:16.470 --> 49:18.920
Of the Departure? No,
I believe that's tomorrow.

49:18.970 --> 49:22.975
Not the Departure.
Your mother's death.

49:27.060 --> 49:30.430
You do remember
attacking me in Mapleton?

49:30.480 --> 49:32.935
I was outside your house
handing out fliers

49:32.985 --> 49:36.070
with your mother's photo on them.

49:37.825 --> 49:41.860
I know it was cruel. I'm sorry for
digging into your life like that,

49:41.910 --> 49:45.495
but I was doing everything
I could to make you feel again.

49:47.665 --> 49:50.335
I had forgotten that.

49:50.385 --> 49:54.705
Well, then I apologize for being your

49:54.755 --> 49:56.975
living reminder.

50:08.020 --> 50:09.970
Can I ask you something?

50:10.020 --> 50:11.905
Sure.

50:20.700 --> 50:23.535
What you waiting for?

50:25.205 --> 50:26.905
I'm sorry?

50:26.955 --> 50:30.995
You and all these people out here,

50:31.045 --> 50:33.095
you're so close.

50:34.715 --> 50:36.830
It's right there.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.880
Just over the bridge.

50:41.270 --> 50:42.970
You want it,

50:43.020 --> 50:45.305
but you're not doing
anything to get it.

50:45.355 --> 50:47.855
So what are you waiting for?

50:53.280 --> 50:55.365
You want me to tell you?

50:56.870 --> 50:58.400
Yes.

51:02.325 --> 51:04.405
You're waiting for me.

53:26.050 --> 53:27.935
Who are you?

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
