02:33.403 --> 02:34.695
- We're on the wrong fucking beach.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.280
- Ah...

02:36.906 --> 02:37.990
Tide turning.
- Yeah.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.783
We were moving faster
through the channel.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.994
- It plonked us around the fucking corner.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.413
- No chance getting back round the coast
fighting that rip.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.418
I was hoping for a cup of tea and a cake.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.003
- Better get off this beach.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.966
- Mines?
- Bound to be.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.316
: Ben...

03:13.026 --> 03:14.568
Got a date tomorrow.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.822
: Let me guess.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.616
You met her down the pub.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.744
Nurse, huge tits.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.666
- Like a pair of ripe melons
ready for the plucking.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.174
She's got this friend...

03:38.551 --> 03:39.509
I was...

03:45.850 --> 03:47.643
You've got to move on sometime, Ben.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.771
Look, just come along,
have a bit of fun.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.649
Her friend's a real doll.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.237
She's tall, ugh, blonde.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.407
Legs all the way up to her armpits.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.162
Ben...

04:07.330 --> 04:09.456
- We haven't got time for this.
I'm walking it.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.169
- Oh, shit.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.445
I was just admiring the view.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.533
My little nurse is not gonna be too happy
if I leave my crown jewels

05:26.701 --> 05:29.328
blown all over this beach.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.336
You better back off, Ben.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.838
- I trust you.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.945
If you marry her and have kids...

06:05.198 --> 06:07.240
you better bloody well
name one after me.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.535
- Slow... and steady this time.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.217
Better get on with it.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.386
Don't wanna keep the nursey
waiting now, do we?

07:19.313 --> 07:20.564
- Right address this time?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.943
- Path up there.
- Oh...

08:02.899 --> 08:04.483
- What the fuck was that?

08:08.488 --> 08:11.031
- I don't know, I don't care.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.950
Let's just get the job done
and get the fuck off this island.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.948
Ugly-looking place.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.576
This is bullshit.
Where is everyone?

09:04.252 --> 09:06.753
- They're fucking torturing
some poor bastard in there.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.215
- This isn't a rescue mission.
- What if it's one of ours?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.718
You know what those bastards did
to Blondie's men in Bordeaux.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.720
- It's not our mission.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.768
: Jesus.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.478
Jesus Christ in heaven!

10:49.940 --> 10:52.692
Help... Help us, please!

11:10.878 --> 11:14.089
- There's bad shit going on here.
Bad shit.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.510
Bastards. Fuckin' Nazi bastards.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.554
- No.

11:21.722 --> 11:25.058
It's not our war. This is our fight.
The gun, that's our mission.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.768
- Fuck the mission.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.269
- Jesus Christ.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.439
We leave. Now.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.692
We get out alive.
We get back home.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.652
- Back home to what?

11:37.113 --> 11:38.905
- Look, we've done what we came here to do.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.074
We'll get fucking medals for this.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.327
The girls will be falling all over us!

11:53.629 --> 11:55.130
- Give me ten minutes, Joe.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.135
- Five.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.094
Fuck.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.014
Fuck it.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.115
Bravo Seven Foxtrot,

15:09.283 --> 15:12.452
this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.830
Bravo Seven Foxtrot,

15:15.998 --> 15:19.417
this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.978
Bravo Seven Foxtrot,

15:39.146 --> 15:42.774
this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.408
Bravo Seven Foxtrot,
this is Alpha Nine Golf.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.953
Request radio check. Over.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.961
Bravo Seven Foxtrot,

16:03.921 --> 16:08.216
this is Alpha Nine Golf. Over.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.635
- Fuck you.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.569
- Joe...

21:22.281 --> 21:23.364
- Name...

21:26.118 --> 21:27.285
Rank...

21:27.452 --> 21:29.787
Number. Yes?

21:40.507 --> 21:41.716
Good teeth.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.302
Clean.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.514
Some people I know in Germany
actually collect teeth.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.059
Perhaps I should cut
that useless tongue out.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.648
But what use are you, if you can't...
talk to me, yes?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.509
You can thank your own people
for this little trick.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.935
Was it not your own gangster commandos
who raided these very islands,

22:36.188 --> 22:39.482
killing innocent German prisoners
with their hands tied behind their backs?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.068
Cathartic, is it not?

22:43.570 --> 22:45.071
The release of pain surging
through your body.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.692
What was your mission?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.195
- Hmm...

23:32.035 --> 23:33.369
- Not enough to destroy the installation,

23:33.537 --> 23:36.372
but adequate...
to put it out of action for a while.

23:38.708 --> 23:39.667
Why?

23:43.422 --> 23:46.465
To protect your armies...
as they cross the English Channel

23:46.633 --> 23:48.050
and... retake these islands?

23:51.721 --> 23:53.013
You're a little late,

23:53.181 --> 23:54.181
aren't you?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.436
The population here is so hungry...

23:59.646 --> 24:01.063
they're reduced to eating rats.

24:02.691 --> 24:06.444
What is this English... Channel... anyway?

24:09.698 --> 24:11.866
Does anybody outside of England
call it that?

24:13.076 --> 24:16.829
Do the people of these... Channel Islands
even think themselves English?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.469
So, you planned to put the gun
out of action.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.975
And presumably others
of the neighbouring islands,

24:38.143 --> 24:40.352
which... as the Führer predicted

24:40.520 --> 24:45.274
are to become the staging post
for your invasion of... France.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.499
Your silence is admirable.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.759
- Fuck you, Fritz.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.142
: God in heaven...

25:52.050 --> 25:53.133
It is hungry.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.263
: You bitch!

26:39.431 --> 26:42.725
You think I have nothing better to do
than feed you?

26:51.526 --> 26:52.526
Whore!

28:22.617 --> 28:25.035
So, should we begin again
in a more civilized way?

28:25.203 --> 28:28.706
Or do you wish to end up
like your unfortunate friend over there?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.338
Grogan.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.717
Captain.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.262
75241.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.727
Who is that woman up there?

28:52.147 --> 28:53.731
- If only you knew the truth of that.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.442
- Oh, I can see the truth,

28:56.609 --> 28:58.360
splattered all around this room.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.950
What is she, a plaything
for you and your men?

29:05.744 --> 29:09.288
You take a special little fancy to her, yeah?
Want her all for yourself?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.584
Even your own army
will hang you for this.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.960
- This?

29:16.588 --> 29:19.047
You think a single man
is responsible for this?!

29:20.759 --> 29:22.176
She did this to them!

29:22.802 --> 29:24.219
- You're insane.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.189
- You may not believe this,

29:35.356 --> 29:38.442
but you and I are in the same boat.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.279
- Call me picky,

29:42.947 --> 29:44.072
but I'm the one who's tied up

29:44.240 --> 29:47.659
and threatened with
summary execution here... Fritz.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.996
- Meyer. Klaus Meyer.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.166
Perhaps I should rephrase.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.419
We are in the same shit.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.339
I admire your marvellous accent.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.425
South Africa?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.971
Australia? Ah!

30:10.642 --> 30:13.018
The guttural... nuance.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.813
New Zealand.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.067
You are indeed
a long way from home.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.860
- Same could be said about you.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.654
New Zealanders.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.199
A bunch of farmers
pretending to be soldiers,

30:27.367 --> 30:29.827
driving around the deserts
of North Africa,

30:29.994 --> 30:33.038
attacking by night,
then fleeing to hide like cowards.

30:35.124 --> 30:38.669
So, where in England
will the invasion come from?

30:39.128 --> 30:40.254
Southampton?

30:41.840 --> 30:42.881
Poole?

30:46.135 --> 30:48.095
Which of these islands
do you plan to take first?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.555
Guernsey, perhaps?

30:50.265 --> 30:51.682
Alderney?

30:52.934 --> 30:54.101
Then to France?

30:54.853 --> 30:55.853
Which beaches?

31:01.860 --> 31:04.695
Oh, perhaps it's not so... bad
if we were to lose these islands...

31:04.863 --> 31:06.280
to men like you.

31:07.156 --> 31:08.699
- Never yours to lose.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.327
- And yet here you are,
thousands of miles from home.

31:12.495 --> 31:15.706
And what... exactly is your home,
Captain Grogan?

31:15.874 --> 31:18.125
An... island that does not
belong to you either,

31:18.293 --> 31:21.295
populated by the descendents
of cannibals and headhunters.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.714
Who exactly do you fight for,
Captain Grogan?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.465
For King and country?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.218
Or for Britain or New Zealand?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.263
We are more similar that you care to admit.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.764
You are a New Zealander,

31:32.932 --> 31:34.892
but of British descent,
are you not?

31:35.727 --> 31:38.270
Was not Britain itself
a nation of Vikings and Saxons,

31:38.438 --> 31:39.897
superior Germanic people?

31:40.231 --> 31:42.733
We should be fighting on the same side,
not against each other.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.571
But enough of politics.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.124
Very pretty.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.128
Strong features.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.841
Girlfriend?

32:10.094 --> 32:11.136
Wife?

32:13.348 --> 32:15.349
Awaiting the return of her hero husband?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.019
Pity...

32:19.187 --> 32:20.395
...if I were to...

32:22.941 --> 32:26.109
Tell me exactly when the Allies
plan to take back these islands.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.572
- Go fuck yourself.

32:31.199 --> 32:35.285
- Well, that is a soldier's lot
on lonely outposts such as this.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.164
- No!

32:42.168 --> 32:43.752
- Soon she will be gone.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.088
Who is she?

32:48.383 --> 32:49.758
I have my duty.

32:51.719 --> 32:52.803
Please.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.394
- She's Helena.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.402
My wife.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.321
She was my wife.

33:13.616 --> 33:16.994
April 1941, in London,
there was an air raid.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.830
Shelter was hit. Hundreds were buried.
I went to help.

33:25.211 --> 33:27.921
We found only mangled corpses,
women and children.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.010
I made it home in the early hours
of the morning. Our hou...

33:33.970 --> 33:35.679
Our house had been hit.
And...

33:40.435 --> 33:42.436
I dug again, this time alone.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.024
And I found her.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.238
What was left of her.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.037
I never got to say goodbye.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.418
This war has taken its toll on all of us.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.462
- You say that
as if you're not responsible.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.596
- I am just a soldier, like you.

34:17.764 --> 34:18.804
- No.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.141
No, not like me.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.503
Ah!

35:25.748 --> 35:27.332
: I told you...

35:29.335 --> 35:31.128
We're both in the same shit.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.341
We could've helped each other.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.596
- What could I possibly
help you with, Meyer?

35:45.434 --> 35:47.185
Torturing female prisoners?

35:50.439 --> 35:52.524
Murdering your own men?

35:55.570 --> 35:58.989
What kind of lunatic Special Action Unit
did they pull you out of?

36:02.577 --> 36:06.621
Jews and Gypsies not enough for you?
- I've already told you...

36:09.792 --> 36:12.169
None of those men died by my hand.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.838
That prisoner,
she is not what you think she is.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.235
- Sorry, Joe.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.287
: Please, help me. Please.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.093
Please, help me.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.600
- It's safe.
- Don't...

38:33.728 --> 38:36.021
You're safe now.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.408
I can take you from here.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.036
There's a submarine off the coast.
We can get to it.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.670
Jesus! Jesus Christ!

39:00.838 --> 39:02.589
Ben...

39:07.845 --> 39:09.346
- Helena...

39:13.351 --> 39:16.186
No... No, you're dead.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.771
- Please...

39:18.189 --> 39:20.357
There isn't time to explain.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.276
The German, he'll be back.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.699
Don't leave me here with him.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.578
Don't let him touch me.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.581
- How... How can this be?

39:37.041 --> 39:42.295
- Ben! You've got to get me free.
You've got to unlock this chain!

39:46.050 --> 39:49.344
- You were so...
You were so torn.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.807
You-you-you were broken.
You, uh...

39:55.601 --> 39:56.976
I held you in my arms.

39:57.144 --> 40:00.230
- Ben... pull yourself together.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.317
This is real. I promise.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.862
There's a key... downstairs.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.239
You must find it.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.449
- Don't think about releasing her.
There's a good chap.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.077
- What in God's name is going on here?!
- Nothing in God's name,

40:14.245 --> 40:15.537
I can assure you of that.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.664
Now, please, step away from her.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.874
- Ben, help...
- Silence, you hag!

40:20.835 --> 40:23.503
That creature
is not who you think she is.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.256
- How is she here?

40:28.259 --> 40:32.429
- That Luger had...
only three rounds left.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.557
By my count, you are out of bullets.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.270
You don't believe? Shoot me.

40:41.147 --> 40:44.190
- Drop the Schmeisser.
Kick it here.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.236
- An officer and a gentleman to the last.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.321
How boring.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.240
Ah!

40:52.408 --> 40:54.117
I need you alive.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.286
No!

40:56.454 --> 40:57.787
Bastard!

41:03.043 --> 41:05.503
What the fuck did you just do,
you Nazi bastard?

41:05.671 --> 41:07.714
: I've saved your life.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.883
She'd have killed you
if you'd set her free.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.470
Listen to me.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.847
I have information.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.516
A weapon...

41:18.684 --> 41:20.977
...more dangerous than anything
you can imagine.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.188
- You lying bastard!

41:23.772 --> 41:25.648
- Kill me... and you'll never know.

41:27.735 --> 41:28.776
- Talk!

41:31.280 --> 41:32.906
- That creature...

41:33.866 --> 41:35.283
She's part of it.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.495
- Bullshit.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.371
I can prove it.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.207
- No. Your turn to die.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.001
- Please, I beg you.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.644
- You lie to me
and I'll cut your fuckin' balls off,

42:02.811 --> 42:04.562
and gut you like a pig,
you understand?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.776
What the fuck is going on here?

42:09.944 --> 42:11.819
How can Helena be here?

42:12.530 --> 42:13.780
Tell me.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.532
- She's not your dead wife.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.786
Ugh... Please tell me you believe that.

42:25.543 --> 42:30.046
I am Colonel Meyer
of the SS Germanorden.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.716
How many soldiers have the blood tattoo?

42:38.847 --> 42:42.475
How many soldiers
carry papers of that nature?

42:43.978 --> 42:48.815
You must understand, the Führer
has long been obsessed with the occult.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.943
He set up the SS Germanorden,

42:52.111 --> 42:54.404
a specialist unit dedicated

42:54.572 --> 42:58.408
to scouring the world for...
mystical materials.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.577
I was sent here on...

43:02.997 --> 43:06.416
a highly secret mission.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.710
The outcome which c...

43:08.877 --> 43:11.087
could affect the entire war.

43:13.591 --> 43:17.218
These islands you're so keen to save...

43:19.054 --> 43:21.431
you know, they have something
of a reputation.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.143
- For what?
- Witchcraft.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.438
What on earth do... do you think
we're dealing with here?

43:30.482 --> 43:32.442
You may see her as your dead Helena.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.777
I see my loving Gretta,

43:34.945 --> 43:36.779
who is still very much alive in Hamburg.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.573
That soldier...

43:39.617 --> 43:43.286
That was Lieutenant Otto Schillmann.

43:43.454 --> 43:48.291
A good soldier, until his girlfriend
tried to use his intestines as a necklace.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.460
- Enough of this fairytale bullshit.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.629
- That is how they died.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.007
Each one.

43:56.175 --> 43:59.886
Ripped apart and devoured by someone
they thought was the love of his life.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.430
- Ah... you really are insane.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.641
- The platoon stationed here were starving.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.478
They hadn't been supplied for weeks,

44:09.938 --> 44:11.981
reduced to foraging for food.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.862
They found... an abandoned cottage.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.865
A ruin.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.368
There they found something.

44:23.535 --> 44:25.036
A book.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.080
Have you heard of the Grimoires?

44:27.831 --> 44:30.166
- The what?
- In the Middle Ages,

44:30.334 --> 44:33.169
witches were more feared
on these islands

44:33.337 --> 44:36.005
than in any other part
of the British Isles.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.679
They drew their power
from a series of ancient texts.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.100
Grimoires.

44:47.476 --> 44:49.102
Bad books.

44:50.104 --> 44:52.939
Whose purpose was the invocation
of demonic forces.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.982
Allow me to prove it.

44:55.150 --> 44:57.318
I will show you the true nature
of this horror.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.740
I need your knife.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.746
Come, demon bitch.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.915
You can cease pretending.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.377
I know you need your meat.

46:21.445 --> 46:22.528
See?

46:24.782 --> 46:26.824
- Jesus Christ, Meyer.
What have you done?

46:26.992 --> 46:30.495
: Benjamin?
: Do not implore his help, demon.

46:31.580 --> 46:32.997
I've shown him what you are.

46:36.043 --> 46:39.086
- My love... I'm your Helena.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.839
Surely you can see.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.384
- Isn't this what you really seek?

46:51.225 --> 46:53.768
- I am no animal to be chained.

46:55.020 --> 46:58.314
Release me, and the forces I serve

46:58.482 --> 47:01.651
will grant you powers
beyond your wildest dreams.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.654
- So said Lucifer in the desert
to Our Lord Jesus Christ.

47:04.822 --> 47:09.283
- Ah! Surely that holy name
turns to poison in your mouth, Nazi.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.702
- You cannot divide us, demon.

47:11.870 --> 47:14.497
I will send you back to the darkness.

47:15.457 --> 47:18.042
Treat this as your last meal.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.578
I present your loving wife.

47:56.665 --> 47:58.374
I will show you everything, Grogan.

47:58.542 --> 48:02.253
How I summoned... this monster.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.005
And how we will dispel it.

48:04.172 --> 48:05.715
Ugh...

48:10.888 --> 48:12.638
: Ben...

48:12.806 --> 48:14.891
Don't leave me.

48:42.544 --> 48:46.213
- Be warned... Captain Grogan.

48:47.549 --> 48:49.383
If I die,

48:49.551 --> 48:52.803
you lack the knowledge
to send that creature back to Hell.

49:06.610 --> 49:09.779
- You be warned, there's no morphine.

49:10.572 --> 49:12.865
This is gonna hurt... a lot.

49:23.710 --> 49:25.294
: Oh, God!

49:28.632 --> 49:30.383
Christ's blood!

49:30.550 --> 49:32.259
- Keep bloody still!

49:37.766 --> 49:39.642
: Oh, God!

49:47.275 --> 49:49.568
Christ's blood!

49:59.997 --> 50:01.789
Ah...

50:08.380 --> 50:09.505
- Colonel?

50:15.137 --> 50:17.847
Don't die on me now,
not after the trouble I've been through.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.628
: Ben...?

52:54.796 --> 52:56.964
Ben? Are you down there, darling?

53:14.983 --> 53:16.984
I know you're listening.

53:18.195 --> 53:20.196
I can replace her, Ben.

53:21.531 --> 53:23.199
I can be Helena.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.827
Release me from this chain.

53:27.621 --> 53:30.831
Release me,
and I will take my place beside you.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.718
- Do demons sleep, Colonel?

55:09.014 --> 55:10.347
- Who knows?

55:12.517 --> 55:14.143
When incarnate on earth,

55:16.146 --> 55:18.939
when clothed in living flesh--
- Yeah, spare me.

55:20.108 --> 55:22.318
- She is Femme-Varou.

55:24.112 --> 55:25.946
- What?

55:27.866 --> 55:29.325
- Femme-Varou.

55:30.744 --> 55:32.703
That is her real identity.

55:36.958 --> 55:38.334
May I?

55:51.556 --> 55:53.182
In mythology,

55:54.768 --> 55:57.353
the Femme-Varou
are shape-shifters.

56:01.024 --> 56:02.358
She is a carnivore.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.195
A desecrator of human flesh.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.822
But she comes with a beautiful
and familiar face,

56:08.990 --> 56:11.033
to confuse and deceive her victims.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.578
- You... summoned one.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.958
- I had orders to test... the book.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.382
- On fellow German soldiers?
- All war involves sacrifice.

56:27.384 --> 56:29.176
An island like this is perfect.

56:29.886 --> 56:33.097
This particular demon
cannot cross flowing waters.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.434
Even if she'd killed us all,
she would be trapped here.

56:37.602 --> 56:39.395
- But she didn't kill you all.

56:41.940 --> 56:44.233
One does not summon demons...

56:44.401 --> 56:46.443
...without the means
to defend oneself against them.

56:47.821 --> 56:49.613
Whoever carries the words

56:50.824 --> 56:54.326
contained within that pouch
will be safe from her.

56:54.494 --> 56:57.663
Against them she is forbidden
to cause mortal harm

56:57.831 --> 57:00.082
and has no more strength
than a normal woman.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.085
- Let me guess.

57:04.254 --> 57:06.130
There's only one of these.

57:09.801 --> 57:12.719
- I'll admit, I was not prepared
for the viciousness of her attack,

57:14.055 --> 57:15.806
or the extent of her appetite.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.101
But she killed so many...

57:20.645 --> 57:21.687
It's unfortunate.

57:21.855 --> 57:25.441
But what a...
what a weapon she is,

57:26.651 --> 57:28.318
spawned in Hell itself.

57:28.862 --> 57:32.114
Imagine if she were unleashed in London,

57:32.282 --> 57:35.659
deceiving and slaughtering her way
to Churchill himself.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.579
She would...

57:38.746 --> 57:41.457
she would make Jack the Ripper
look like a kindergarten tale.

57:43.626 --> 57:46.712
She cannot be killed by mortal means.
She can only be bound in iron.

57:46.880 --> 57:49.214
But that... will only hold her for so long.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.300
She can be dismissed back
to the netherworld,

57:51.468 --> 57:53.469
but only by the knowledge
contained in there.

57:54.137 --> 57:55.679
And trust me,

57:57.474 --> 57:59.099
she is just a lesser demon.

57:59.267 --> 58:01.143
There are far worse than her
in that book.

58:04.063 --> 58:07.107
Help me...
and the book is yours.

58:08.276 --> 58:09.776
- Why?

58:11.654 --> 58:13.489
Why would you do that?

58:14.324 --> 58:17.326
- I love my country, but I'm not blind
to the atrocities she's committed,

58:17.494 --> 58:20.704
nor am I comfortable with
what will happen if she wins.

58:22.332 --> 58:26.126
Perhaps it is...
better if the righteous prevail.

58:29.339 --> 58:31.507
- And what's the price
of betraying your country?

58:32.509 --> 58:33.926
- A deal.

58:35.136 --> 58:38.597
Immunity from prosecution for myself,
my wife smuggled out of Germany,

58:38.765 --> 58:41.141
new lives and a new identity
for both of us.

58:43.770 --> 58:44.811
In return...

58:45.522 --> 58:48.732
I will educate your leaders
in the dark secrets of this book.

58:49.400 --> 58:52.986
- Why don't I just take this book
and kill you?

58:53.947 --> 58:56.114
- A brave soldier returning
to rave of demons and witchcraft?

58:56.282 --> 58:58.575
How many occult experts
do you have in your army, Captain Grogan?

58:58.743 --> 59:00.285
Bravo Seven Foxtrot,

59:00.453 --> 59:02.162
this is Alpha Nine Golf.

59:02.330 --> 59:04.373
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!

59:04.541 --> 59:07.209
- How long was I unconscious?
- An hour, maybe longer.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.835
: God in Heaven!
The garrison on Guernsey

59:09.003 --> 59:10.587
is sending a boat
to collect me at dawn.

59:10.755 --> 59:12.172
We must escape before they arrive.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.840
- What about her?

59:14.008 --> 59:15.425
- She is trapped on this island,

59:15.593 --> 59:17.719
but she is a denizen of Hell.

59:17.887 --> 59:19.388
Who knows the strength of her powers?

59:19.556 --> 59:21.890
For our own safety,
we must dispel the demon now.

59:22.058 --> 59:23.475
- How?

59:24.394 --> 59:25.978
- The ritual.

59:26.980 --> 59:28.564
It requires two of us.

59:36.990 --> 59:38.574
The pouch. I need it.

59:40.410 --> 59:43.412
Captain Grogan, do you have any idea
with what you're dealing with here?

59:44.038 --> 59:45.205
There are rules.

59:46.124 --> 59:49.001
Without those words kept close to my skin,
I cannot complete the ritual.

59:51.588 --> 59:53.255
You must trust me.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.610
Get the candles.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.243
- Ben? Look at me.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:26.371
- Do not look at it.
- You've been swayed against your will.

01:00:26.539 --> 01:00:30.626
- You must cut me, then yourself.
A blood sacrifice is required.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.520
Now yours.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:56.026
Do you willingly give all that I ask of you
in this cause?

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.446
- Yes.
- We must be very clear on this.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.659
- Yes.
- You have not been coerced?

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.287
- No, I willingly give.

01:01:07.872 --> 01:01:09.373
- Then spill your blood.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:14.336
: No!

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.930
- Downstairs! Quickly!

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.318
- For God's sake, there's no lock!

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.792
- We must get downstairs!
- And that'll hold her?!

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.460
- Just long enough! Go!

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.383
Make space!

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:24.573
We must draw a double-edged circle
to protect us both.

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:35.041
Hurry! Now!

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:45.469
Stop!

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.724
Do not stand on or over the circle.
Exit and enter only through that gap.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:09.075
Once everything is prepared,
we will seal the circle from inside.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.203
More candles. Now!

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:26.635
Baal.

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:35.852
Xaphan.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.147
Samael.

01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:42.317
Lilith.

01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:44.861
Lucifer.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:51.159
White candles around the circle.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.171
Give me the knife!

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.715
Damn it, man!
Our lives depend on it!

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.700
The Flesh of Mankind harnessed.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.624
The Bone of Mankind harnessed.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.915
The Mind of Mankind harnessed.

01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:32.344
Stay inside the circle.

01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:36.097
If you value your life,
do not leave it.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.773
We are ready.
Let the demon bitch assail us.

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:23.436
- Joe?
- Ugh?

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.821
- Shacked up with the enemy, Ben? Ha!

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.573
- No, no. Joe...
- It's not real, Grogan.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:42.205
Stay in the circle!

01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:45.542
- After all those missions.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.004
After all the boys we lost.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:57.804
- It's not real.

01:07:01.475 --> 01:07:03.518
Ha!

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:09.441
There's nothing there.
It's just an apparition.

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:11.276
A trick.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.653
Nothing more.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.748
- Why don't you start?
- The demon must be present.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.625
- Why would she come down here
if this will harm her?

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:29.627
- She will come down here
because she is hungry

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:33.423
and we are the freshest meat,
the tastiest dish on the table.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.891
- What the hell is going on?
- Quiet.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.515
- What were you expecting, my love?
The Devil?

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.935
- Don't listen to it.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.109
- Ah!

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.118
Efficient and organized.

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:22.031
Haven't you wondered
why I'm attempting to entice you

01:09:22.198 --> 01:09:24.158
rather than him?

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.911
- He knows what you are.

01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:29.747
Does he?

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:51.853
- And I know you, too.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:59.068
: No, you do not!

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:01.321
: See, Grogan?

01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:03.323
This demon cannot abide defiance.

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:04.782
This is the truth of it.

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:07.243
The abomination that seeks to seduce you.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:09.537
: I wonder, Captain Grogan,

01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:13.875
do you really consider
you've backed the right horse here?

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:19.631
These goblins in black uniform
plan to enslave your world.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.718
Do you wish to hand them the means
on a plate?

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.095
: Do not listen to it.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:35.480
- Their leader has long been searching
for so-called wonder weapons,

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.443
magical items with which
he will kill your people...

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.112
in multitudes.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:46.866
He already holds the Holy Lance.

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:51.037
He had within his grasp
the Ark of the Covenant.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:54.374
He tried to awaken the Great Old Ones.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:59.796
And now he has within his reach
the power to summon Lucifer himself.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:03.258
: Do not listen, Grogan.
It will try to divide us.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.928
- I've laid bare my true self,
Captain Grogan.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:08.972
Has he?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.518
- I compel thee by the three most dreadful
and mighty names of Inferno,

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:15.937
Abaddon, Ob and Astaroth!

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.106
How long is this gonna take?

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.942
- I must incant the dismissal
for as long as necessary, to weaken it.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.278
- It doesn't seem
to be getting any weaker to me.

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:26.364
But I am, Ben. I am.

01:11:27.908 --> 01:11:30.952
- I curse thee into the depths
of the Bottomless Pit!

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.455
- I'll be gone from this world
if you allow him to proceed.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:37.292
- There to remain in unquenchable fire
and brimstone

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.668
until the Day of Wrath!

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.545
- Do you wish to lose me forever?

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:46.259
- Until thou be obedient and fulfil my will
and commandment once more!

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.720
- There were happy occasions weren't there,
my love?

01:11:48.887 --> 01:11:50.471
In the short time that we had.

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:54.142
- I command thee, demon,
who art wicked and disobedient!

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:59.063
- When you held me, kissed me,
made love to me...

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.774
- Helena...
- Her name is not Helena!

01:12:01.942 --> 01:12:04.152
She is a She-Devil!
A Femme-Varou!

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.530
- I've followed all your battles.
- I curse thee into the depths

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:08.990
of the Bottomless Pit!

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.825
- North Africa...

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.160
Greece...

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.369
Italy...

01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:17.665
- There to remain in unquenchable fire
and brimstone until the Day of Wrath!

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.751
- Always in the front line.

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:24.297
Driven beyond reason
by a desire to be with me again.

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:27.258
You don't have to do that now, my love.
I'm here for you.

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.802
Come to me.
- Grogan, in God's name!

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:32.764
Do not break the circle!

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.350
- Have you missed me, my love?

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:44.025
: Until thou be obedient and fulfil
my will and commandment once more!

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.736
- I can be this way for you always.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:50.615
- I command thee, demon,
who art wicked and disobedient!

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.283
Don't be a fool, Grogan!

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:56.162
Don't let her deceive you!
She's a devil, a desecrator!

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.831
- Listen to him, spewing his bile.

01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:03.211
- I command thee in the names of Peor
and Nyarlathotep!

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:08.925
I compel thee by the three most dreadful
and mighty names of the Inferno,

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:13.554
Abaddon, Ob, Astaroth!

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:16.849
- Do you know why I'm not
desecrating your flesh, my sweet?

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:20.895
- Hear ye, fallen ones,

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:25.650
dead names,
lords of the Netherrealm!

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:30.238
Receive back into thy clutches
this prodigal beast

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:33.658
who is condemned to return to thee!

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.451
- Why I'm not devouring your soul?

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:37.412
- Balor!

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.415
Choronzon!

01:13:41.291 --> 01:13:43.376
Adramelech!

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:47.088
Chancellors of all the darkness!

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.715
- The flesh of a good man is rank to me.

01:13:49.883 --> 01:13:52.844
- Be bound and obey my command!

01:13:53.011 --> 01:13:54.846
- The flesh of an evil man...

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.140
Give me the Nazi and you're spared.

01:13:57.307 --> 01:14:00.309
- No... No, I need him.

01:14:00.477 --> 01:14:03.146
- Be bound and obey my command!

01:14:03.313 --> 01:14:04.814
- You poor fool.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:07.650
Be bound and obey...

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.569
- Look.
- ...my command!

01:14:16.326 --> 01:14:19.370
: You son of a bitch!
- Fuck you, Hell whore!

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:30.840
Did you honestly believe...
a loyal servant of Germany

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:33.342
would hand you over the book
and betray his country?

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:38.181
As a willing sacrifice,
you are now the agent of our success.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.311
And when I'm recognized
as the architect of this triumph,

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.396
I will rise
and sit beside Hitler himself.

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:49.317
All I need now is the power contained

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.612
within the power of a brave
and beating heart.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.907
And that is the role you play, Grogan.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.870
How fortunate that you came here
to embrace your destiny.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:02.997
- You'll create Hell on earth.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:07.084
- We already have.
- Time you saw the real one.

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:27.605
: Give him to me!

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:33.361
- No, please.
- Give him to me!

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:36.697
Embrace your own fucking destiny!

01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:44.121
- No! You can't harm me!

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.504
- The deceiver deceived.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.140
At last we are together, my sweet.

01:16:04.017 --> 01:16:07.979
Did I not warn you of the price
when first you imprisoned me?

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:20.992
You, who have butchered so many...

01:16:22.202 --> 01:16:24.829
you're still novices
in the game of death.

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:21.093
- I compel thee, demon,
be bound and obey my command!

01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:22.845
Are you trying to dismiss me?

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:25.765
I thought you liked me.

01:17:25.932 --> 01:17:27.683
- Stay back.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:29.477
- Oh, look.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:33.064
Some thoughtful person
has built a little bridge for me.

01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:36.609
- I compel thee, demon,

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.653
be bound and obey my command!

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.321
I command thee, demon...

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.698
- Ben, your hand is hurt.

01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:44.867
Let me look at it.

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:47.787
Let me.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.209
Ben...

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:56.962
Darling...

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.688
You still fear me?

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:15.856
- Yes.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:18.150
- But...

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.697
I believe your yearning for Helena
is stronger, yeah?

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.246
Huh?

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:36.711
Ah...

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.037
What's wrong, my love?

01:19:12.205 --> 01:19:14.540
- You think I don't know my own Helena?

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:16.375
- Ben...

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:21.714
- Her taste? Her smell?
- Ben...

01:19:24.384 --> 01:19:26.343
- You can never replace her.

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:30.139
: No!

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:34.268
You cannot do this to me!

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:37.980
You wish to make an enemy of me
for eternity?

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:39.607
Unchain me now!

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.776
You bastard son of Adam!

01:19:43.403 --> 01:19:46.405
You're no better
than the ones you despise,

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:48.240
the ones you fight against.

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:49.784
- You should be thanking me.

01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:54.205
Every one of those German sailors coming
has a wife or a lover.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.792
And all the others after them.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.753
Plenty of fresh meat for ya.

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.464
- And when there are no more lambs
to the slaughter?

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.050
- We'll return, send you back
to where you belong.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:08.219
- How the righteous have fallen.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:10.221
- Ah, the enemy must be stopped.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.640
This war must be won.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.308
Bravo Seven Foxtrot,

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:16.060
this is Alpha Nine Golf.

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:18.479
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.565
- Quickly. They're coming.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.737
- Bravo Seven Foxtrot,
this is Alpha Nine Golf.

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:31.242
Status urgent!
Request radio check, over!

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.588
: Hello? Colonel Meyer?

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.778
My God.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:40.371
: Oh, my God.
Franz, is that really you?

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.626
Franz, Franz. It's me, Nicole.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.212
- Nicole? How?

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.590
What's... what's going on?
Where did you come from?

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.550
- Where did I come from?

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:57.012
From Hell, dear.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.640
: From Hell.
