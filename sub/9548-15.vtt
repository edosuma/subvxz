WEBVTT

00:07.274 --> 00:11.370
Four coins, nothing in the hands.
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.278
Watch carefully. If you blink,
you'll miss it.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.315
Coin number one jumps.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.144
Or maybe I want
to jump over there.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.948
Maybe it'll jump
over there.

00:20.021 --> 00:23.855
The third coin could go in that corner.
The last one, the hardest one.

00:23.924 --> 00:24.948
There it is.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.090
How does he do it?

00:28.162 --> 00:30.460
Why does he bother? Here.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.597
Not really.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.431
That's a lovely watch.
Can I borrow that?

00:37.605 --> 00:38.970
Thank you.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.269
I'll trade you.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.209
Your watch for

00:46.080 --> 00:47.138
this chick.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.541
He says, "Bring it back."

00:50.618 --> 00:51.607
Oh.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.454
Don't you like chicks?

00:56.791 --> 00:57.883
Okay.

01:05.266 --> 01:09.862
He says he will make this bullet disappear
in your skull. Where is the watch?

01:09.937 --> 01:12.098
That's a very good question.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.608
Why don't you ask him?

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

01:34.695 --> 01:36.560
How much?
Seventy kilos.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.427
It is the biggest
shipment yet.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.691
Can you handle it?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.861
Yes.
Absolutely. No problem.

01:42.937 --> 01:43.926
No problem.

01:46.941 --> 01:50.399
He says there is only one
magic trick he wishes to see.

01:50.845 --> 01:54.337
He wants to see this heroin
disappear from Thailand,

01:54.482 --> 01:57.940
and magically reappear on
the streets of San Francisco.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.513
Is that a trick you can do?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.122
Absolutely.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.760
Abracadabra!

02:11.198 --> 02:13.223
It's a jungle out there

02:13.667 --> 02:16.261
Disorder and confusion
everywhere

02:18.272 --> 02:20.365
No one seems to care

02:20.474 --> 02:21.498
Well, I do

02:21.609 --> 02:24.510
Hey, who's in charge here?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.546
It's a jungle out there

02:28.282 --> 02:31.080
Poison in the very air
we breathe

02:31.552 --> 02:33.986
You know what's in the water
that you drink?

02:34.054 --> 02:34.952
Well, I do

02:35.022 --> 02:38.014
It's amazing

02:38.359 --> 02:39.917
People think I'm crazy

02:39.994 --> 02:41.461
'cause I worry
all the time

02:41.595 --> 02:44.860
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too

02:44.932 --> 02:46.331
You better pay attention

02:46.400 --> 02:48.561
Or this world
we love so much

02:49.270 --> 02:52.569
might just kill you

02:53.007 --> 02:55.168
I could be wrong now

02:55.242 --> 02:57.005
But I don't think so

02:57.077 --> 02:59.739
'Cause there's
a jungle out there

02:59.813 --> 03:01.542
It's a jungle out there

03:11.023 --> 03:13.184
This goes here.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.456
Add this to this.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.396
You go here. There you are.

03:19.498 --> 03:21.056
I've been looking for you.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.727
Subtracting that,
subtracting that.

03:26.305 --> 03:28.205
Subtracting that, and...

03:29.475 --> 03:33.605
No. That is absolutely
not right. At all.

03:33.712 --> 03:35.976
Applause, applause, applause.

03:36.048 --> 03:38.573
Different music cue.
Show the cage.

03:39.118 --> 03:43.179
It's gone. Oohs and ahs from the audience.
That's when you bring on the cabinet.

03:43.255 --> 03:46.349
You wheel it on. There you go,
big smile. Give it a spin.

03:46.425 --> 03:49.485
Right there. Not too fast.
Let them see it.

03:50.963 --> 03:53.090
That's lovely. Okay.
Then we open...

03:53.165 --> 03:54.223
Round about
there is good.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.995
We open the cabinet.

03:56.068 --> 03:58.400
Nothing inside. Everyone can
see it's empty.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.462
Nothing up my sleeves.
You go inside.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.542
Like this?
Perfection. And...

04:05.277 --> 04:06.403
Who's that?

04:06.512 --> 04:08.036
Dorfman, what are
you doing here?

04:08.114 --> 04:10.378
This is a closed rehearsal.
Right. Sorry.

04:10.449 --> 04:12.417
I'm not looking.
I can't see anything.

04:12.485 --> 04:13.816
Well, I can see
my feet, actually.

04:13.886 --> 04:15.979
I hope that's all right.
I am looking at them.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.454
This better be
important, okay?

04:17.523 --> 04:18.990
Yes, it is.

04:19.658 --> 04:22.091
It's about your taxes.
My what?

04:22.161 --> 04:24.254
Why are you whispering?
Well, 'cause it's private.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.127
It's Tanya.
Hi, Tanya.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.930
Oh, my. That is
fantastic.

04:36.008 --> 04:39.967
You are really the Great Torini.
And I haven't even met the other Torinis.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.547
I don't even know if there
are halfway decent Torinis.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.016
You know, it's funny. I'm thinking about
doing something similar in my own act.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.076
As you know, I'm
a magician as well.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.918
Yes, Kevin. I've seen
your act on amateur night.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.187
Well, I'm not
in your league, of course.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.760
Not yet, anyway.
Here's the trick.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.057
I use a cat.
Mmm-hmm.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.860
A little Persian kitten. Hold it out
like this. Cover it with a handkerchief.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.532
Abraca-Dorfman.
It's a butterfly.

05:02.601 --> 05:04.193
Kevin, I'm very busy here.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.794
I realize that.
Little problem.

05:05.871 --> 05:10.205
I've been looking at your receipts from
your last world tour. Let me show you this.

05:10.276 --> 05:11.766
These are your airline receipts.
Right.

05:11.844 --> 05:15.610
Your equipment, according to these,
weighed more on the way back

05:15.681 --> 05:17.012
than on the way there.

05:17.983 --> 05:19.473
Really?
Yeah.

05:19.552 --> 05:22.988
I checked the records. Same thing happened
last year and the year before that.

05:23.055 --> 05:24.989
The airlines are
ripping you off.

05:25.057 --> 05:27.753
I say we get a lawyer.
I say we sue the SOBs.

05:27.826 --> 05:29.726
You and me.
Let's get 'em.

05:31.163 --> 05:32.687
Yes. Well.

05:33.232 --> 05:36.633
Good work, Kevin.
As always. Thank you.

05:36.702 --> 05:38.431
Here's what we're gonna do.
Okay.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.869
Close the book.
Okay.

05:39.939 --> 05:42.169
Go ahead, close it.
All right.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.932
I want you to forget about it.
Mmm-hmm.

05:44.009 --> 05:47.501
Put it out of your mind.
We'll take care of this next week.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.708
Right now I have a bigger problem.
I need your help. Okay.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.581
I'm supposed to headline
here Saturday night.

05:53.652 --> 05:55.813
Something's just come up.
Oh, my goodness.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.482
I'm taking Tanya to Reno.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.050
Truth is,
I'm going to ask her to marry me. Get out.

06:02.127 --> 06:03.719
That is wonderful.
Yeah.

06:03.796 --> 06:05.559
Anyway, point is I need
someone to fill in,

06:05.631 --> 06:08.225
and I wondered if
you'd be interested.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.699
Oh, my goodness.

06:11.237 --> 06:12.636
Am I ready?

06:13.772 --> 06:16.866
Kevin, I've been watching you.
You're a natural. That's true.

06:16.942 --> 06:18.842
See, magic is all about
self-confidence.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.937
If you believe you can do
something, you can do it.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.379
Then I can do it.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.542
I can do it and I'm gonna do it.
Okay.

06:25.618 --> 06:26.846
Thank you.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.012
Mr. Torini,
you will not regret this. Okay.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.453
Well, you might regret it
a little bit.

06:30.522 --> 06:32.956
But you won't regret it that much.
Okay.

06:37.696 --> 06:38.890
And...

06:44.937 --> 06:46.871
Thank you. Okay. Um.

06:48.340 --> 06:52.140
Has anyone seen my cane? I'm kind of
in the mood to take a little stroll.

06:52.211 --> 06:53.838
Oh, there it is.

06:57.916 --> 07:01.443
I'm going to need
everybody in the crowd

07:01.520 --> 07:04.318
to say Abraca-Dorfman.

07:05.891 --> 07:09.190
Abra... Abraca-Dorfman.
Abraca-Dorfman.

07:11.063 --> 07:13.258
Wow.
Wow!

07:13.332 --> 07:14.629
Oh. How is that happening?

07:14.700 --> 07:16.895
Wow, that's a good one.
How did you do that?

07:16.969 --> 07:18.095
It's not over yet.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.665
Now it's over.

07:20.739 --> 07:24.368
I'm sorry, but a magician
never reveals his tricks.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.541
Okay, I'll tell you.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.844
It's a special wire. You see,
it's painted black. So it's invisible.

07:31.216 --> 07:34.743
You see? You can't see it in the light,
and it's attached

07:35.187 --> 07:36.518
to this coat rack.

07:36.588 --> 07:41.252
You didn't even... You didn't even see
the coat rack. Okay, wait. Time out.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.251
Ow, that's really...

07:43.329 --> 07:44.353
Kevin.
Yeah.

07:44.430 --> 07:48.890
I'm just curious.
How did you get this job?

07:51.403 --> 07:54.702
It's an interesting story,
actually. Um, I have a...

07:54.907 --> 07:57.705
I have a friend at the, uh,
at the Castle,

07:57.776 --> 08:02.110
and, uh, Karl Torini, he's more of a...
More of a mentor, really. But a friend.

08:02.247 --> 08:05.648
We were chatting it up yesterday,
as friends do, about a lot of things.

08:05.718 --> 08:10.655
But mostly travel. And I was pointing out
to him that he is getting overcharged.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.715
Oh, yeah. The airlines have
been overcharging him for years.

08:13.792 --> 08:18.820
How can his equipment weigh more on
his return trips than when he left?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.859
Anyway, to make a long...

08:27.306 --> 08:29.240
Okay. One second.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.840
To make a long story short...
It's a little late for that.

08:37.916 --> 08:41.510
...he had to go to Reno and, uh,
kind of asked me to fill in for him.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.452
Yeah. Well, we should...
Okay.

08:43.621 --> 08:45.749
And now, it's time

08:45.824 --> 08:48.122
for my pièce de résistance.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.893
That means piece
of resistance.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.064
I call it

08:57.903 --> 08:59.598
the vanishing man.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.438
Or lady.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.439
The vanishing man or lady.
It's a temporary title.

09:06.512 --> 09:09.413
I'm going to need
a volunteer from the audience.

09:09.481 --> 09:12.382
Anyone want to volunteer?
Just raise your hand.

09:12.451 --> 09:15.113
Raise your hand up high to get up onstage...
Go. Come on.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.156
...with the magician.
Oh, you, sir!

09:18.223 --> 09:19.986
So gracious of you.

09:20.058 --> 09:23.118
I like that jacket.
Did somebody have a garage sale?

09:23.195 --> 09:25.891
I'm joking, folks,
but seriously.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.898
Have we ever met before?

09:27.966 --> 09:29.763
Kevin, I'm not gonna
get in that box.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.735
Please get in the box
real quick for a second.

09:31.804 --> 09:32.862
No. I was...
Just real quick.

09:32.938 --> 09:35.532
I was buried... No, I'm not.
Just one second. Just real quick in the box.

09:35.607 --> 09:38.508
I was buried alive once, and,
um... I understand.

09:38.577 --> 09:42.980
You know, there's just no way on God's green
earth that I'm going to get into that box.

09:43.048 --> 09:45.175
So... - You're disappointing
a lot of my fans out there.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.810
Just tell them you...
- Get in the box for a second, real quick.

09:47.886 --> 09:50.218
Just real quick,
get in the box. No.

09:50.722 --> 09:53.486
A lot of people are going to
go home disappointed tonight.

09:59.998 --> 10:01.795
Dorfman, ten minutes.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.030
You okay? Well.
Yeah. Yeah.

10:04.102 --> 10:06.195
I'm good.

10:06.472 --> 10:08.565
I'm good. Awesome.

10:08.907 --> 10:10.397
Magic Castle.

10:11.009 --> 10:12.408
Yeah. Sure.

10:12.911 --> 10:15.607
Yeah. Yeah, hold on. Hold on.

10:16.014 --> 10:17.743
Everybody, it's Torini!

10:17.816 --> 10:20.376
He's calling from Nevada.
Says he has some big news.

10:23.188 --> 10:26.385
Am I on speaker phone? Yes, sir.
Go ahead. We're all here.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.188
Tanya and I have some great news.
We wanted everyone to know.

10:29.261 --> 10:30.660
Tanya, do you
want to tell them?

10:30.729 --> 10:33.095
- No, you go ahead.
- Okay.

10:33.165 --> 10:36.362
I just asked Tanya to marry
me, and she said yes.

10:40.472 --> 10:41.837
Mr. Torini.
Yes.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.431
Hi, it's Kevin Dorfman,

10:43.575 --> 10:46.373
from back... From backstage here.
I just wanted to let you know,

10:46.445 --> 10:49.141
I am dedicating my show
to you and Tanya.

10:49.214 --> 10:50.806
Oh, Kevin.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.407
That's the icing on the cake.

10:52.484 --> 10:54.179
This is for you guys.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.982
That's great.
Damn it.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.953
And please let
that be your card. No.

11:04.296 --> 11:08.027
Is this your card

11:08.100 --> 11:10.728
that I magically pulled
out of your ear?

11:10.802 --> 11:11.860
No.

11:12.704 --> 11:15.002
Is it a heart or a spade?

11:16.074 --> 11:17.564
Red or black?

11:17.743 --> 11:19.643
Is it a jack of clubs?

11:20.012 --> 11:21.274
Say yes.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.847
Uh, yes. Excellent. Thank you so much.
Jack of clubs it was.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.511
Yeah. Give her a round of applause.
She was excellent.

11:27.619 --> 11:29.177
Um...

11:29.922 --> 11:33.619
Thank you. And now, who wants
to get sawed in half?

11:35.227 --> 11:36.990
No? No one? All right.

11:37.696 --> 11:40.563
You're leaving? Okay, excellent.
Thanks so much. Thanks so much for coming.

11:40.699 --> 11:44.100
Um, nobody wants to be sawed
in half. No one?

11:44.836 --> 11:46.201
Fantastic.

11:46.738 --> 11:48.137
Moving on.
For my final trick...

11:48.206 --> 11:49.696
I'd like for everybody...

11:50.242 --> 11:53.803
Thank you, sir. I'd like for
everybody to say hello to Fluffy.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.369
Hi, Fluffy.
Hello, Fluffy.

11:55.647 --> 11:58.980
Here he is. Fluffy,
say hello to everybody.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.212
Go in the box. Whoa. Easy.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.048
Fluffy. Come on.

12:04.623 --> 12:07.251
Here we go. Okay.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.191
Okay.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.423
Please, for the love of God.

12:13.231 --> 12:14.755
Abraca-Dorfman.

12:16.568 --> 12:18.536
Oh! Yeah.
Okay!

12:18.737 --> 12:21.035
Yeah.
Thank you so much. Yeah.

12:21.106 --> 12:23.540
Thank you. Okay, excellent.

12:23.609 --> 12:24.667
Um...

12:24.743 --> 12:29.646
My name is Kevin Dorfman. Uh, if you
like the show, please tell management.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.216
And, uh... Oh, my goodness.
Don't look at my pants.

12:33.151 --> 12:37.417
Please. Everything's fine.
It's all part of the act. This is part of it.

12:37.489 --> 12:38.547
Ah!

12:38.624 --> 12:41.855
That really hurt me.
Nibbling. Ah. Okay.

12:43.128 --> 12:46.461
Hurt a little bit.
I'm going to leave now. Thank you so much.

12:46.598 --> 12:49.032
Thank you. I thought
they only ate lettuce.

12:50.969 --> 12:52.732
What did you think?

12:54.106 --> 12:57.439
Give me a minute.
I'm still absorbing it.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.410
You know, I... I didn't
think it was that bad.

13:01.279 --> 13:05.716
Natalie, there are three
dead doves on that stage.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.886
Presentation, B-.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.916
Energy, A-.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.759
Execution,
let's be honest, D+.

13:17.062 --> 13:18.086
D-.

13:18.163 --> 13:21.257
But don't let it get you down.
You've got to just focus...

13:23.769 --> 13:25.259
What are you doing here?

13:25.871 --> 13:28.066
What do you think
is keeping him?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.334
Shame.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.340
Just a guess.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.504
Mr. Monk, why don't you go look
for him and I'll wait here?

13:45.357 --> 13:48.520
Oh, excuse me. I'm looking
for the dressing rooms.

13:48.593 --> 13:49.924
Thank you.

13:59.337 --> 14:01.601
Kevin? It's Adrian.

14:02.941 --> 14:04.738
Hey, congratulations.

14:06.378 --> 14:07.538
Kevin?

14:09.648 --> 14:11.946
Are you trying to levitate?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.211
Kevin?

14:22.658 --> 14:25.286
He was just... Just a kid.

14:26.428 --> 14:29.522
Did he say anything?
I mean, was he in trouble?

14:34.937 --> 14:36.063
Look.

14:37.406 --> 14:39.203
I know this is tough.

14:41.010 --> 14:46.038
If you want to take a step back,
go home, everybody here would understand.

14:46.115 --> 14:47.412
I'm here.

14:47.917 --> 14:49.851
Okay.
Let's do it.

14:52.288 --> 14:53.414
Okay.

14:55.090 --> 14:57.524
He was asphyxiated.
Strangled.

14:57.593 --> 14:58.787
Oh, no.

14:58.861 --> 15:00.556
Probably from behind.

15:00.629 --> 15:04.087
The killer used a ligature.
Something thin and strong.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.697
Probably piano wire.

15:06.802 --> 15:08.099
Can I see it?

15:08.170 --> 15:12.004
We haven't found it yet.
Or he took it with him. We don't know.

15:30.259 --> 15:33.023
The killer, it's a magician.

15:36.532 --> 15:38.796
What is that?
Black paint.

15:40.202 --> 15:42.966
They paint their wires
so they can't be seen.

15:43.038 --> 15:44.665
A magician. That's good.

15:44.740 --> 15:47.140
You were the first one back here.
Did you see anybody?

15:47.209 --> 15:48.471
Mmm-mmm.

15:48.677 --> 15:49.735
No.

15:49.979 --> 15:53.210
There was a maintenance man.
Maybe he saw something.

15:53.616 --> 15:56.312
The maintenance crew doesn't
work on Saturdays.

15:56.385 --> 15:57.784
Oh, my God.

16:00.689 --> 16:02.020
I saw him.

16:02.558 --> 16:03.547
You saw him.

16:03.626 --> 16:04.854
I saw the guy.

16:07.563 --> 16:09.997
He was the nicest
kid I ever knew.

16:10.099 --> 16:15.196
I mean, last summer, after the hurricane,
he came over and cleaned out all my gutters.

16:16.238 --> 16:17.967
Except for the garage.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.601
But we didn't have gutters in the garage.
We have them now.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.611
We didn't have them then.

16:25.047 --> 16:27.311
I put them in three weeks ago.

16:27.383 --> 16:31.444
Yeah, actually, I had
to redo the whole roof.

16:32.721 --> 16:34.484
That's a nice picture.

16:34.556 --> 16:36.456
I took that picture.
Oh.

16:36.525 --> 16:37.924
It took me two hours.

16:37.993 --> 16:41.190
I wanted to get one where he wasn't talking.
Huh.

16:41.664 --> 16:42.653
Well, you did it.

16:42.731 --> 16:45.222
Actually, I had to Photoshop it.
Right.

16:45.334 --> 16:47.529
You must be Adrian Monk.
That's right.

16:47.603 --> 16:49.833
And Natalie.
I'm Kevin's Aunt Sheila.

16:49.905 --> 16:53.068
Oh. Hello. We're
so sorry for your loss.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.702
Oh, thank you, dear. Oh.

16:55.811 --> 16:59.838
Oh, I just feel like I
know you both.

16:59.948 --> 17:02.280
He talked about you all the time.
Yeah.

17:02.351 --> 17:04.046
Oh, God bless him.

17:04.118 --> 17:05.551
We had a little tradition.

17:05.621 --> 17:07.851
He would call me every Sunday
and tell me all about his week.

17:07.923 --> 17:09.515
We never missed a Sunday.

17:09.590 --> 17:10.579
Yeah.

17:11.426 --> 17:14.726
I think that's what I'm
going to miss most of all.

17:14.797 --> 17:16.526
Our Sunday night chats.

17:16.665 --> 17:19.065
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, ma'am.
He was very special.

17:19.134 --> 17:20.226
Wait.

17:20.301 --> 17:21.564
I tell a lie.

17:21.704 --> 17:24.867
We did miss one Sunday
twelve and a half years ago.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.965
That was the summer I traveled
to Italy with my mahjong group.

17:28.042 --> 17:30.534
Oh.
But we made up for it when I got back.

17:30.612 --> 17:31.977
We spoke twice that week.
- Oh.

17:32.047 --> 17:34.379
Friday and Sunday.
Imagine that.

17:34.450 --> 17:38.477
Oh! Then, there was the time my telephone
service was interrupted. No, wait.

17:38.554 --> 17:41.489
That was a Tuesday. So, that really
would not have affected our...

17:41.557 --> 17:43.684
I'm sorry.
I just remembered I'm

17:44.293 --> 17:45.419
thirsty.

17:45.494 --> 17:47.428
You forgot you were thirsty?

17:47.496 --> 17:51.227
Oh. I've just been so busy.
So nice to meet you.

17:52.901 --> 17:54.664
Hello.
So, it's hereditary.

17:54.737 --> 17:58.468
Apparently, it's a dominant trait.
You know what? I really am thirsty.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.405
Oh, excuse me.
Where did you get that?

18:00.476 --> 18:03.274
Oh, it's in the lobby.
Just down the hall. Hmm.

18:07.349 --> 18:10.341
Excuse me. I'm... I'm looking
for the dressing rooms.

18:13.122 --> 18:16.250
Who is that man? That's Torini.
That's Kevin's friend.

18:16.325 --> 18:20.193
He's the magician. The best in the world.
That's what they say.

18:24.433 --> 18:28.529
I'm sorry. I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm Adrian Monk.

18:28.604 --> 18:29.901
This is Natalie Teeger.

18:29.972 --> 18:31.940
Yes, of course.
The famous detective.

18:32.074 --> 18:33.769
Karl Torini.
Yes.

18:33.842 --> 18:36.504
My assistant,
Tanya Adams. Hello.

18:36.578 --> 18:39.308
Were you a friend of Kevin's?
Or are you working on the case?

18:39.381 --> 18:41.076
Both. Both.

18:41.150 --> 18:44.313
How's it going? Well.
There's nothing to report.

18:44.386 --> 18:46.081
At least not yet.

18:46.755 --> 18:48.780
You worked with Kevin,
didn't you?

18:48.857 --> 18:51.826
Well, I didn't really know him.
I am a featured performer.

18:51.894 --> 18:54.260
He was usually in the back
room crunching numbers.

18:54.329 --> 18:57.298
He was filling in for you
on Saturday night, wasn't he?

18:57.366 --> 18:58.697
Oh, yes, that's right.

18:58.767 --> 19:01.634
Uh, it was a last-minute thing.
I took Tanya to Reno.

19:01.703 --> 19:04.399
We got engaged.
Oh, congratulations.

19:04.473 --> 19:06.065
You're not wearing a ring.

19:06.141 --> 19:09.406
Oh, I know, um. You know,
it just happened so fast and we didn't...

19:09.478 --> 19:12.106
As you can imagine,
after what happened.

19:12.181 --> 19:13.671
We were so distraught.
Oh.

19:13.749 --> 19:16.217
Suddenly, a ring just didn't
seem so important.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.479
Of course.

19:17.553 --> 19:20.522
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we'd like to pay our respects.

19:21.857 --> 19:23.654
Good luck, Mr. Monk.

19:28.764 --> 19:30.254
He's the guy.

19:30.332 --> 19:31.526
Because of the ring?

19:31.667 --> 19:33.328
Because he's the guy.

19:33.402 --> 19:36.303
I saw him.
I recognize him.

19:36.738 --> 19:38.228
He was there.

19:42.444 --> 19:43.775
Karl Torini?

19:43.846 --> 19:44.972
He's the guy.

19:45.047 --> 19:49.211
Monk, Karl Torini was in Reno.
As in Reno, Nevada, and he can prove it.

19:49.284 --> 19:51.912
No, no, no. He's the guy.

19:51.987 --> 19:53.181
Maybe he hired someone.

19:53.255 --> 19:54.745
No. I saw him.

19:55.157 --> 19:57.990
He was there dressed as
a maintenance man. Captain,

19:58.060 --> 19:59.254
he killed Kevin.

19:59.328 --> 20:02.923
Monk, he called the theater from
Nevada just before the show.

20:02.998 --> 20:04.488
Well, maybe he called
from someplace else.

20:04.566 --> 20:06.625
No. We already checked.

20:06.702 --> 20:09.193
The phone records are
right here.

20:10.439 --> 20:15.035
The call was placed from the Sands
Regency Hotel in Reno at 9:55 p.m.

20:15.477 --> 20:18.469
It was made from his hotel room.
It was a direct call. It was not rerouted.

20:18.547 --> 20:21.778
Right. Besides, he put the damn
phone call on the speaker phone.

20:21.850 --> 20:24.978
There were ten people that heard it.
We got statements from every one of them.

20:25.053 --> 20:28.113
Monk, if you were the DA,
what would you say?

20:30.492 --> 20:34.223
You want me to dig?
I'll... I'll grab a shovel. I'll dig for you.

20:34.630 --> 20:37.394
But you gotta tell me
what to look for.

20:37.466 --> 20:38.933
I don't know.

20:43.138 --> 20:44.628
I don't know.

20:46.575 --> 20:49.135
How long have you
two been together?

20:49.211 --> 20:50.974
Oh. Six years.

20:51.046 --> 20:55.073
See, Karl was in Toronto.
I was in the audience, believe it or not.

20:55.150 --> 20:58.551
He needed someone to levitate.
I raised my hand.

20:58.687 --> 21:00.211
And now, you're family.

21:00.289 --> 21:01.483
That's right.

21:03.325 --> 21:06.294
Oh. We bought it last night.
It's official.

21:06.361 --> 21:08.420
Congratulations again.

21:08.497 --> 21:11.125
Oh, look. Bunnies.

21:11.199 --> 21:12.962
Hello.

21:13.235 --> 21:14.725
Hi, sweeties.

21:15.704 --> 21:17.171
Natalie, don't touch.

21:17.239 --> 21:18.570
No, it's okay.
She can pet them.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.039
No, she can't.

21:20.108 --> 21:21.871
These are Karl's
other assistants.

21:21.944 --> 21:23.878
We breed them here.
It's cheaper than buying them.

21:23.946 --> 21:27.507
They're breeding
in the house?

21:27.582 --> 21:29.948
We'll be outside.
No, we won't be outside.

21:30.018 --> 21:32.350
We're staying.
We're not leaving.

21:33.655 --> 21:37.091
Did you know him very well?
Kevin, I mean.

21:37.159 --> 21:38.558
Um.

21:38.627 --> 21:41.653
He lived in Mr. Monk's
building. He was a neighbor.

21:42.864 --> 21:44.388
Did he have any children?

21:44.466 --> 21:45.660
No.

21:46.401 --> 21:48.164
Thank God for that.

21:48.303 --> 21:50.430
You don't ever cover them up?

21:50.505 --> 21:53.167
You leave them out in the open?
So close to the kitchen?

21:53.241 --> 21:56.233
Tanya? You know, if you know
anything about what happened,

21:56.411 --> 21:59.972
you can talk to us.
You could call us anytime.

22:00.082 --> 22:02.016
Oh, I don't know anything.

22:02.084 --> 22:03.813
I was just, you know, asking.

22:04.653 --> 22:06.780
I'll go see if Karl's ready.

22:07.856 --> 22:09.153
Mr. Monk.

22:09.624 --> 22:12.354
Mr. Monk, did you hear that?
I think she knows something.

22:12.427 --> 22:13.826
Uh-huh.

22:13.895 --> 22:15.624
What are you doing?

22:16.765 --> 22:18.596
Just trying to figure out
how it works.

22:18.667 --> 22:21.659
No. I don't want to know.
It ruins the effect.

22:24.639 --> 22:26.402
Ow!
Oh, okay.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.375
This one might be real.

22:28.443 --> 22:30.604
Don't play with this one.
Okay.

22:30.679 --> 22:32.112
I won't.
What's that?

22:35.817 --> 22:37.842
It's called a Zig-Zag Cabinet.

22:37.919 --> 22:39.511
I designed it myself.

22:46.695 --> 22:49.323
Please step away
from the cabinet, Mr. Monk.

22:49.398 --> 22:51.992
Secrets of the trade,
you understand.

22:57.906 --> 22:58.998
God.

22:59.274 --> 23:00.502
How did you do that?

23:00.575 --> 23:03.703
Misdirection, Ms. Teeger.
The secret to every illusion.

23:03.779 --> 23:07.078
Making the audience look where
they shouldn't be looking.

23:07.215 --> 23:08.614
For example.

23:12.721 --> 23:14.382
Did you see that?

23:14.723 --> 23:16.213
Watch closely.

23:16.291 --> 23:19.192
If it goes here,
then it can't be over here.

23:19.261 --> 23:21.161
If I take it in the left hand
and put it over there,

23:21.229 --> 23:22.662
then it can't be back
over here, can it?

23:22.731 --> 23:25.291
It's hard to follow. Sometimes,
people think the coin is too small.

23:25.367 --> 23:27.198
I can make it bigger.

23:28.670 --> 23:32.367
Hmm. Tough room. I'm sensing
a little hostility.

23:34.643 --> 23:36.736
The night Kevin was killed,

23:37.045 --> 23:39.036
you were in the theater. I...

23:39.114 --> 23:40.843
I saw you backstage.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.017
What? Really?

23:44.152 --> 23:46.552
You were dressed
as a maintenance man.

23:46.955 --> 23:48.616
Weren't you?

23:48.690 --> 23:50.624
Either you're mistaken

23:52.961 --> 23:54.588
or you're bluffing.

23:55.864 --> 23:58.128
I was 300 miles away.

24:01.670 --> 24:03.103
And I can prove it.
All right.

24:03.171 --> 24:05.298
Why did you have Kevin
work for you that night?

24:05.373 --> 24:08.035
Well, as I explained to the
police, I was leaving town.

24:08.110 --> 24:11.546
I needed someone to fill in.
I'd seen Kevin before and I thought he was

24:11.680 --> 24:12.738
quite wonderful.

24:12.814 --> 24:14.714
Ha.
Okay.

24:14.783 --> 24:19.413
We saw Kevin's act.
He was dreadful. God rest his soul.

24:19.521 --> 24:22.422
You're wasting
your time, Mr. Monk.

24:23.758 --> 24:25.919
You know, I called the club.

24:26.027 --> 24:28.928
Just five minutes before
Kevin went onstage.

24:29.931 --> 24:34.334
It was a direct call
from Reno, Nevada.

24:34.402 --> 24:36.393
I'm sure you checked
with the phone company.

24:37.939 --> 24:40.373
Ooh, looks like
it's going to rain.

24:42.043 --> 24:44.273
You killed him.
I know you did.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.214
Why would I harm the boy?

24:47.282 --> 24:50.547
You don't have the why.
And you don't have the how.

24:52.654 --> 24:54.019
Huh.

24:54.189 --> 24:55.850
I love this part.

24:57.492 --> 25:00.791
The look on their face.
When they can't figure it out.

25:00.862 --> 25:03.660
This isn't some trick,
Mr. Torini. This isn't a show.

25:03.732 --> 25:04.721
Kevin was our friend.

25:04.799 --> 25:06.528
He was a good man
who never hurt anybody.

25:06.601 --> 25:08.660
Natalie. He was the sweetest,
shyest person I ever met,

25:08.737 --> 25:11.103
and he was 34, and his life
was just getting started.

25:11.173 --> 25:13.164
This is the most brilliant
detective in the world.

25:13.241 --> 25:16.210
He's going to figure out how you did it,
and he's going to prove it. Aren't you?

25:16.378 --> 25:18.005
Uh... I am.
Aren't you?

25:18.079 --> 25:21.981
Well, if you're going to
catch me anyway, I suppose I

25:22.050 --> 25:23.608
may as well just confess.

25:23.919 --> 25:26.649
What... What?
What do you mean?

25:26.788 --> 25:30.280
In fact, I'll even
put it in writing.

25:36.965 --> 25:39.934
I hereby confess

25:40.001 --> 25:44.370
to the murder of Kevin...

25:44.839 --> 25:47.034
Dorfman.
...Dorfman. Thank you.

25:47.108 --> 25:50.271
Signed, Karl

25:53.148 --> 25:54.376
Torini.

25:58.587 --> 26:00.020
Here you go.

26:01.089 --> 26:02.681
Congratulations.

26:06.628 --> 26:08.528
Abracadabra, Mr. Monk.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.473
Mr. Monk, where are
you putting the trash?

26:20.543 --> 26:22.568
I'm not.

26:22.712 --> 26:24.577
I can't seem to throw
anything out.

26:24.647 --> 26:26.376
Me neither.

26:29.585 --> 26:30.643
God.

26:31.587 --> 26:35.819
Natalie, I have to tell you something.
I mean, I have to tell someone.

26:37.727 --> 26:39.354
I feel terrible.

26:39.529 --> 26:40.689
What is it?

26:42.131 --> 26:43.530
It's Kevin.

26:45.668 --> 26:47.533
He drove me insane.

26:47.637 --> 26:49.332
Oh, Mr. Monk.
No.

26:50.606 --> 26:54.565
He wouldn't shut up.
The man would not shut up.

26:54.677 --> 26:55.974
One time,

26:57.713 --> 26:58.873
he had a sore throat.

26:58.948 --> 27:02.315
He talked for two and a half hours
about how much it hurt him to talk.

27:03.553 --> 27:05.453
Honest. God forgive me.

27:06.189 --> 27:10.387
Sometimes, I'd hear him coming down the
stairs. I'd turn off all the lights.

27:10.459 --> 27:12.324
Pretend I wasn't home.

27:13.362 --> 27:14.351
I...

27:14.897 --> 27:16.262
Mr. Monk.

27:16.432 --> 27:19.401
It's okay, don't feel bad.
Everybody does that.

27:20.069 --> 27:21.934
Sometimes, late at night,
when you call me

27:22.004 --> 27:25.132
and I see your name on
the caller ID, I just...

27:26.642 --> 27:28.109
Just don't feel bad.

27:33.382 --> 27:35.407
Where's my phone?
Are you going to answer that?

27:35.484 --> 27:37.179
Yeah. Where is it?

27:37.620 --> 27:39.383
I hear it.
Where did you put it?

27:39.455 --> 27:41.446
I just put it
right here.

27:43.859 --> 27:45.520
Where did you...

27:46.529 --> 27:48.087
Oh. It's Randy.

27:48.864 --> 27:50.058
Hello?

27:51.467 --> 27:52.934
Yeah.
Tell him to hold on.

27:53.002 --> 27:54.560
Randy, hold on.

27:56.205 --> 27:57.934
Set the phone down.

28:03.846 --> 28:06.679
Monk? Hello? Monk?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.684
What?
Secret compartment.

28:09.752 --> 28:11.379
Monk? Hey, Monk.

28:11.454 --> 28:13.081
Torini, the magician.
Hello?

28:13.155 --> 28:16.784
All that equipment. There must be
secret compartments in everything.

28:16.993 --> 28:21.987
How can his equipment weigh more on
his return trips than when he left?

28:22.999 --> 28:24.728
Randy?
Monk.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.394
Randy, it's Adrian.
Are you there? I think so.

28:27.470 --> 28:30.200
Yeah. I think
you just solved the case.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.934
Glad I could help.

28:40.049 --> 28:43.541
Ladies and gentlemen.
Don't panic. I'm a professional.

28:45.021 --> 28:46.386
Here you go.

28:46.455 --> 28:47.786
All right, here we go.
You know what?

28:47.857 --> 28:49.916
I never know what to do with the
walking cane after that trick.

28:49.992 --> 28:51.653
I say we just get rid of it.

28:56.432 --> 28:58.957
You guys have met
the beautiful Tanya. Yes?

29:01.103 --> 29:03.264
She looks fabulous
in black, doesn't she?

29:03.339 --> 29:05.967
I think she'd look
even better in blue.

29:14.750 --> 29:18.242
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the Zig-Zag Cabinet.

29:22.858 --> 29:25.019
Now, you may have seen other
magicians perform this illusion.

29:25.094 --> 29:28.222
They usually have their
assistant get into the cabinet.

29:28.597 --> 29:31.395
But I just don't want to
lose this one, so...

29:32.568 --> 29:34.661
...l'm going to do
the very same trick

29:34.870 --> 29:36.599
with a complete stranger.

29:38.107 --> 29:41.372
I need a volunteer.
Could we have the house lights up, please?

29:41.444 --> 29:43.571
Thank you. Okay.

29:44.046 --> 29:46.674
Someone's... Amazing how everyone
just looks the other way.

29:46.749 --> 29:48.307
Volunteer, volunteer.

29:48.384 --> 29:49.783
Oh.

29:49.852 --> 29:51.786
The eager Ms. Teeger.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.482
You're volunteering?
Yeah.

29:54.557 --> 29:55.888
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.927
Actually, I'd rather have your boss up here.
No.

29:59.028 --> 30:00.052
No. No, thank you.

30:00.129 --> 30:02.825
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a celebrity in the audience tonight.

30:02.898 --> 30:04.923
Adrian Monk,
the world-famous detective.

30:09.071 --> 30:11.801
I've been reading
a lot about Mr. Monk.

30:11.874 --> 30:14.775
No one has
ever outwitted him.

30:15.010 --> 30:17.808
Tonight I'd like to give that a try.
What do you think?

30:18.114 --> 30:20.105
Yeah? Get him up!

30:20.483 --> 30:22.007
I can't do it.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.080
You have to do it.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.355
Come up. Adrian Monk.

30:31.227 --> 30:34.390
It's kind of perfect, really.
I... I wanted a stranger,

30:34.497 --> 30:36.727
and there's really no one
stranger than Adrian Monk.

30:39.802 --> 30:43.568
I had more. Not playing
with a full deck, Mr. Monk?

30:45.040 --> 30:48.373
Thank you. Okay, Mr. Monk.
Let's bring him up. Okay.

30:50.746 --> 30:51.974
Come up.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.277
Are you nervous?

30:57.153 --> 30:58.415
Are you?

31:00.556 --> 31:02.114
Let's really scramble
his brains.

31:03.893 --> 31:05.451
Stand here, please.

31:05.528 --> 31:08.520
Zig-Zag Cabinet.

31:09.131 --> 31:10.496
In you go.

31:13.903 --> 31:17.896
Oh, I forgot. You're just a little
bit claustrophobic, aren't you?

31:17.973 --> 31:20.703
Well, if you'd
rather not give it a try...

31:21.243 --> 31:24.508
Tanya? Would you like to help
Mr. Monk with his jacket?

31:24.613 --> 31:26.638
Uh, no.
She's very good at that.

31:26.715 --> 31:28.512
That's why I'm marrying her.

31:32.188 --> 31:33.450
Perfect.

31:34.757 --> 31:36.554
In you go, Mr. Monk.

31:50.873 --> 31:52.204
In you go.

32:06.288 --> 32:08.017
How are you doing
in there, Detective?

32:08.090 --> 32:10.149
Not so well.

32:10.259 --> 32:12.454
Yes, fabulous.
Lovely. Okay.

32:13.429 --> 32:14.691
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:14.763 --> 32:17.095
Tanya and I have performed this
illusion all over the world.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.724
Do it for Kevin.
- In fact, last year

32:18.801 --> 32:20.735
I accidentally cut a woman in two.
Do it for Kevin.

32:20.803 --> 32:22.600
It's okay. It's okay.
Do it for Kevin.

32:22.671 --> 32:24.036
She's now living
quite happily in Minneapolis

32:24.106 --> 32:25.266
and St. Paul.

32:30.613 --> 32:31.910
Comfy?

32:34.283 --> 32:37.013
Solid steel blades.

32:41.891 --> 32:44.155
Handmade
from surgical steel.

32:44.693 --> 32:47.662
Let's cut Mr. Monk in two.

32:49.331 --> 32:51.356
Check that out, Mr. Monk.

32:55.671 --> 32:57.161
One more.

33:06.415 --> 33:07.609
Watch.

33:21.964 --> 33:23.329
Okay.

33:28.671 --> 33:31.333
How are you doing
in there, Detective?

33:31.407 --> 33:33.773
I got you.
I beg your pardon?

33:33.842 --> 33:35.867
The real money is on the road.

33:35.978 --> 33:37.502
Isn't that what you said?

33:41.250 --> 33:42.581
And what is that?

33:42.651 --> 33:45.779
That is a chemical test strip.

33:46.889 --> 33:50.552
Your Zig-Zag Cabinet just
tested positive for heroin.

33:52.194 --> 33:56.096
You've been using your props to
smuggle drugs into the country.

33:56.498 --> 33:59.831
Here's what happened. Yes, well,
thank you. I almost forgot to mention,

33:59.902 --> 34:01.995
sometimes the cabinet drives
people completely batty.

34:03.639 --> 34:06.233
I think we need to
descramble him.

34:07.443 --> 34:08.739
Let's go.

34:37.906 --> 34:40.466
Adrian Monk,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:45.547 --> 34:46.844
Mr. Monk?

34:52.888 --> 34:54.185
Mr. Monk?

34:55.690 --> 34:57.090
He's gone.

35:02.001 --> 35:03.901
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're the damn magician!

35:03.970 --> 35:06.234
What happened to him?
But I don't know what more to tell you.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.034
It's not supposed to be
a vanishing act.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.007
It's a simple prop gag.
Look, look.

35:10.076 --> 35:12.909
Sections move back and forth
like this, and that's it.

35:12.979 --> 35:15.072
That's the whole gag.
I'm as mystified as you are.

35:15.148 --> 35:18.447
Yeah, well, you better get un-mystified,
and fast. Where's your assistant?

35:18.518 --> 35:19.985
Probably backstage.

35:20.453 --> 35:23.786
You can scream all you want.
No one ever comes down here.

35:23.856 --> 35:26.654
I'm going to die.
In this room.

35:26.993 --> 35:28.051
You're right.

35:28.127 --> 35:31.722
He's going to kill you, and then he's
going to burn your body in that furnace.

35:31.798 --> 35:35.097
No. I was talking
about the soot.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.795
But what you're saying
is worse.

35:39.906 --> 35:41.965
It's much, much worse.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.766
Hey. Any luck?
He could be anywhere.

35:44.844 --> 35:47.438
There must be
300 rooms in this place.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.545
Gentlemen,

35:49.615 --> 35:51.947
as much as I would
love to stay,

35:52.018 --> 35:53.713
I have two shows tomorrow.

35:55.588 --> 35:58.250
So, if you want to
talk to me again,

35:59.992 --> 36:01.550
call my lawyer.

36:03.062 --> 36:05.462
He's a better magician
than I am.

36:11.304 --> 36:12.794
Are you okay?

36:14.474 --> 36:17.204
I fall through trap doors
all the time. I know it hurts.

36:18.711 --> 36:23.546
And look. I just want you to know this
wasn't my idea. And I'm... I'm really sorry.

36:23.749 --> 36:26.809
Sorry enough to...
To let me go?

36:27.854 --> 36:28.912
No.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.698
You're not gonna
answer that?

36:40.766 --> 36:42.631
No, it's just an extension.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.757
Pipe tobacco.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.624
Clever.

37:07.793 --> 37:08.817
What is?

37:08.895 --> 37:10.863
How you killed my friend.

37:10.930 --> 37:13.490
Misdirection, right?

37:13.966 --> 37:16.366
The secret to every illusion.

37:18.304 --> 37:21.501
You and Torini went
to Reno that weekend.

37:21.574 --> 37:25.601
You checked in.
He made sure he was seen. Exactly 9:55.

37:25.711 --> 37:30.045
That afternoon,
he snuck out of the hotel and drove back.

37:31.150 --> 37:33.778
He was down here,
in the basement.

37:33.853 --> 37:36.378
He was hiding and waiting.

37:38.658 --> 37:43.391
Then, at 9:55 exactly,
you called the theater.

37:43.496 --> 37:47.193
The phone records were right.
The call did originate from Reno.

37:49.802 --> 37:53.294
Magic Castle.
- Torini picked up the extension phone.

37:53.506 --> 37:54.495
Hold on.

37:54.607 --> 37:57.735
Everyone assumed he was calling from Nevada.
Everybody, it's Torini.

37:58.878 --> 37:59.936
Am I on speaker phone?

38:00.012 --> 38:02.037
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
We're all here.

38:02.114 --> 38:05.982
Tanya and I have some great news.
We wanted everyone to know.

38:06.052 --> 38:07.383
Tanya, do you
want to tell them?

38:07.453 --> 38:08.943
No, you go ahead.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.750
- And she said yes.
- Nobody knew.

38:10.823 --> 38:14.259
Nobody could tell the killer
was already in the building.

38:15.228 --> 38:18.720
Karl, he knows. He knows. And I didn't
tell him. I swear I didn't tell him.

38:18.798 --> 38:21.164
He just figured it out.
He did?

38:21.234 --> 38:22.462
Huh!

38:22.768 --> 38:25.100
So, what do you think,
Mr. Monk?

38:25.504 --> 38:27.267
You have to admit,

38:27.340 --> 38:29.069
the best tricks are
the simplest, huh?

38:29.141 --> 38:31.302
What are we gonna to do?

38:31.377 --> 38:33.368
Like I told you onstage.

38:38.851 --> 38:39.875
Make him disappear.

38:59.672 --> 39:02.004
Monk! Hey! Monk!

39:03.943 --> 39:05.342
Hold still.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.348
Tanya, get down here
and hold his legs.

39:11.517 --> 39:14.953
I don't think I can go through with this.
Tanya! Now!

39:15.821 --> 39:17.686
All right. All right.

39:27.300 --> 39:28.892
You're right.

39:28.968 --> 39:30.526
I'm sorry.

39:31.637 --> 39:34.003
You know what? Let me do it.

39:34.273 --> 39:35.570
You hold his legs.

39:35.641 --> 39:36.903
All right.

39:41.514 --> 39:44.813
Goodbye, Mr. Monk. I'm
sorry it had to end like this.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.916
Looks like I'm going to
need a new assistant.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.316
Starting now.

40:21.387 --> 40:22.376
Please don't!

40:22.455 --> 40:24.923
Police! Let her go!
Let her go!

40:26.058 --> 40:28.959
Put your hands up!
Hands up!

40:29.028 --> 40:30.427
Turn around!

40:31.163 --> 40:32.892
You, too. You, too.

40:32.965 --> 40:35.832
Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk,
are you okay? God, you're...

40:35.901 --> 40:39.064
Let me help you.
There. There you go.

40:44.577 --> 40:46.977
Abraca-Dorfman,
you son of a bitch.

40:49.148 --> 40:50.638
Are you okay?

40:56.522 --> 41:01.789
Hello. My name is Kevin Dorfman,
and this is what they call a video will.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.016
Um...

41:03.429 --> 41:07.331
Which means, sadly,
if you're watching this, I am deceased.

41:10.436 --> 41:15.806
Unless you're me,
and I am watching it to see how I look.

41:16.876 --> 41:17.934
Or

41:18.444 --> 41:22.608
I might have put it in the wrong
case and lent it to you by accident.

41:22.882 --> 41:24.907
That's also a possibility.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.382
Or maybe you're Phil,

41:27.453 --> 41:31.549
the technician at the production
company who's editing this video.

41:31.924 --> 41:36.054
Or Phil is sick, possibly,
and you're his assistant, Craig.

41:36.128 --> 41:38.494
No. Not Craig.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.791
Greg. I remember now.
Craig left

41:40.866 --> 41:42.231
two years ago.
Should I fast-forward?

41:42.301 --> 41:44.963
Greg, I'm sorry for screwing
up your name like that.

41:45.037 --> 41:46.629
No.
Craig went back to school...

41:46.705 --> 41:49.333
Let it play.
...to get his real estate license.

41:49.442 --> 41:52.639
No. It wasn't real estate.

41:52.812 --> 41:55.042
But it was a license.

41:55.147 --> 41:58.139
What other licenses are there?

41:58.284 --> 42:01.310
Is it licenses or licensees?
