Don't you know,

Team Avalor
is the best!

01:13.750 --> 01:15.750
I've never seen
Avalor so excited.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.040
They should be.
This is the first Peace Festival

01:18.040 --> 01:19.750
in over 40 years.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.750
I guess old Queen Shuriki
wasn't so into peace.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.750
Not so much.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.210
But now that she's gone,
I thought it would be good

01:26.210 --> 01:27.500
to bring back the festival,

01:27.500 --> 01:29.460
to celebrate
the lasting peace

01:29.460 --> 01:31.750
between Avalor
and the kingdom of Cariza.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.580
But we all know
the real reason

01:33.580 --> 01:35.790
everybody's excited
about the Peace Festival.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.210
BOTH: Olaball!

01:41.880 --> 01:43.790
About time
you two showed up.

01:43.790 --> 01:46.120
Team Avalor,
fall in.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.540
I hope you all had
a good night's sleep,

01:48.540 --> 01:52.000
because you're going to practice
until I get tired.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.540
Take it to the hoop!
Take it to the hoop!

01:57.790 --> 02:01.330
Ha ha! Rico scores again!

02:01.330 --> 02:02.880
Looking sharp, Rico.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.620
Feeling sharp, coach.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.420
With Rico on the team,

02:06.420 --> 02:09.330
we're going to beat Cariza
like a dusty rug.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.790
Abuela, it's just
a friendly rivalry

02:11.790 --> 02:13.830
between the two
royal courts, remember?

02:13.830 --> 02:15.620
Friendly? Ha!

02:15.620 --> 02:19.330
This game is for
all the tortillas.

02:19.330 --> 02:22.460
Running drills. Go!

02:22.460 --> 02:24.580
I'll pick you up later.

02:24.580 --> 02:26.170
When she's done with us,

02:26.170 --> 02:27.750
you might have
to scrape us up later.

02:29.170 --> 02:31.750
Less talking,
more running.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.710
We have to make
400 empanadas
for the festival,

02:43.710 --> 02:45.000
and less than
a day to do it.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.170
Gabriel!

02:48.170 --> 02:51.580
Mamá! Papá!
Sorry I'm late.

02:51.580 --> 02:53.580
I had to take the princess
to olaball practice.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.540
Oh, how's the team look?

02:55.540 --> 02:57.120
Think they're ready
for the big game?

02:57.120 --> 02:59.210
Beats me. You know
I don't follow olaball.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.540
Who doesn't follow olaball?

03:02.540 --> 03:05.620
Mijo, help me
with the filling.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.040
It's about time we bring
that award back to Avalor.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.790
Right, Papá?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.880
Trophy. It's a trophy.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.080
Right. Trophy.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.580
You know, I actually work
with the team spiker.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.750
Striker. He's called
a striker.

03:18.750 --> 03:21.040
- Right. A striker.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.040
Well, filling's done.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.000
It's not good enough.
I'll have to redo it myself.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.330
I'm trying to help.

03:31.330 --> 03:32.580
What do you want
from me?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.750
I want you to help me
run the bakery.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.540
- We've already been
through this, Papá.

03:37.540 --> 03:40.830
I'm a royal guard now,
not a baker.

03:40.830 --> 03:44.040
The name of this bakery
is Nuñez and Son.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.330
I'm Nuñez, you're
supposed to be the son.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.120
Ugh, my lucky jersey.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.290
I gotta get
back to work.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.750
Gabriel.

03:58.420 --> 04:00.750
Please stay.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.120
Just once,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.880
it would be nice
if something I did
made him happy, you know?

04:05.880 --> 04:07.670
I know.

04:07.670 --> 04:10.420
But you know how stubborn
your papá can be.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.960
You make me happy, mijo.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.620
Thanks, Mamá.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.500
All right,
hot potato.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.210
Hot potato.
Around the horn,

04:20.210 --> 04:22.000
and thread
the needle.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.380
Goal!

04:25.380 --> 04:27.170
Ow, my ankle!

04:27.170 --> 04:29.460
Rico down,
Rico down!

04:29.460 --> 04:30.920
Rico?!

04:30.920 --> 04:32.580
Oh!

04:34.210 --> 04:36.420
It'll be okay, abuela.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.620
Here, Luisa.
Some té de manzanilla

04:38.620 --> 04:40.210
to calm your nerves.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.580
We lost our best player.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.670
How could he do this to me?

04:43.670 --> 04:46.000
Abuela, Rico's the one
with the sprained ankle.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.040
Oh, he'll be fine
in a week.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.960
But we'll endure humiliation
and defeat for an entire year.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.420
I'm sure we can find
someone else.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.500
The game is in two days.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.380
Where am I supposed to find
another big, strong player

04:59.380 --> 05:01.790
on such short notice?

05:01.790 --> 05:03.790
- Princess Elena.

05:03.790 --> 05:05.500
Just wanted to
let you know I'm back.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.170
Lieutenant Nuñez.

05:09.170 --> 05:12.790
How would you like to be
on the royal olaball team?

05:12.790 --> 05:14.880
Uh, me?
On the team?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.580
You should ask my dad.
He's the olaball player.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.790
It is you we need.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.830
Young, quick, strong.

05:21.830 --> 05:24.040
I'm sure he'd love
to see you play.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.000
You know what?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.960
He would love
to see me play.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.380
All right, I'm in.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.380
Ah, that's my boy!

05:34.380 --> 05:36.750
Defending Avalor's glory.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.620
Well, that's kinda
what I already do.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.750
You know,
as a royal guard?

05:41.750 --> 05:43.380
Right, but this is better.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.750
Let me show you some of
my signature moves.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.920
I call this one
the Roberto Rhumba.

05:50.210 --> 05:52.040
Hey, no hands in olaball.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.790
Sorry. Reflexes.

05:53.790 --> 05:56.540
This one's called
the Roberto Roundhouse.

06:02.170 --> 06:04.210
BOTH: Goal!

06:04.210 --> 06:06.670
Ah, you two.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.710
King Joaquin,
it's so good
to see you again.

06:14.710 --> 06:17.210
The feeling
is mutual, princess.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.960
This is Queen Teresa,

06:18.960 --> 06:20.420
and our daughter,
Caterina.

06:20.420 --> 06:22.000
Queen Teresa.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.170
And it's a pleasure
to meet you, Caterina.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.620
You can call me Cat.
Everyone does.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.380
Oh, you have
a Danaus plexippus

06:28.380 --> 06:29.670
on your shoulder, sir.

06:29.670 --> 06:30.960
A what?!

06:30.960 --> 06:32.620
It's okay, Esteban.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.710
Danaus plexippus
is the scientific name

06:34.710 --> 06:35.880
for a caterpillar.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.210
You know that, too?

06:37.210 --> 06:39.170
Doesn't everyone?

06:39.170 --> 06:41.670
Well, it looks like you two
have something in common.

06:41.670 --> 06:46.080
Your Majesties,
let the Peace Festival begin!

06:48.920 --> 06:50.420
Huddle up. Wait.

06:50.420 --> 06:52.880
- Right here.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.670
Welcome to the team--

06:59.670 --> 07:01.710
Lieutenant Nuñez!

07:01.710 --> 07:03.330
Okay, you know the rules.

07:03.330 --> 07:05.460
Their goal, our goal.

07:05.460 --> 07:08.670
You can use feet, legs,
arms, head, but no hands.

07:08.670 --> 07:11.000
Now let's play
some olaball!

07:12.250 --> 07:14.670
- Naomi!
- Armando!
- Gabe!

07:16.580 --> 07:18.290
Sorry. I wasn't ready.

07:18.290 --> 07:19.620
Let's try that again.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.960
Roberto Rhumba!

07:27.670 --> 07:29.040
I'll get that.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.790
Roberto Roundhouse.

07:38.670 --> 07:40.670
Wow. Gabe is...

07:40.670 --> 07:43.080
- Terrible.
- Yeah.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.790
Ugh! Take five.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.830
No, take ten.

07:46.830 --> 07:50.380
Oh, just take away Avalor's
chance of winning the trophy.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.120
Gabe, are you okay?

07:52.120 --> 07:53.830
What's going on?

07:53.830 --> 07:56.250
I hoped I'd be better
than when I was a kid,

07:56.250 --> 07:59.250
but nope,
I'm still awful.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.620
Then why did you
join the team?

08:00.620 --> 08:04.120
Look, my dad only cares
about two things in this world:

08:04.120 --> 08:06.420
baking and olaball.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.580
And I'm no baker,
so that leaves olaball.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.880
I know it's gonna
sound corny,

08:10.880 --> 08:13.080
but I thought if I could
help the team win the trophy,

08:13.080 --> 08:15.540
then I'd finally do
something to make him proud.

08:16.620 --> 08:17.880
I know.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.620
Pretty ridiculous.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.170
Sorry, princess.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.500
Thank you for
giving me a chance.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.670
I don't want to
drag down the team.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.420
I'm afraid I must
withdraw.

08:30.420 --> 08:33.170
Yes! I mean, what a shame.

08:33.170 --> 08:35.500
- He's not quitting.
- Yes, I am.
- Yes, he is.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.960
Nope. I'm gonna
train him myself.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.670
We'll work day and night.

08:38.670 --> 08:40.790
We only have
a day and a night.

08:40.790 --> 08:43.620
Well, that's more than
enough time.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.290
Are you sure
about this, Elena?

08:45.290 --> 08:47.500
Gabe, this is
important to you,

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
and that makes it
important to me.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.330
So you'll
stay on the team?

08:52.330 --> 08:53.750
If the coach
still wants me.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.420
Abuela.

08:55.420 --> 08:59.790
If you feel
that strongly about it, mija.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.790
I do, so
let's get to work.

09:01.790 --> 09:04.750
All right. I won't
let you down, I promise.

09:04.750 --> 09:05.880
Team Avalor!

09:05.880 --> 09:07.580
Ooh. Okay.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.620
We'll work on
that, too.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.750
BOTH: Whoa!

09:15.750 --> 09:17.500
ISABEL: The voladores!

09:19.750 --> 09:22.710
CAT: Looks like the ropes unwind
from some kind of wooden plank.

09:22.710 --> 09:25.500
I'd love to get up there
and see how it works.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.290
Hey, maybe they could
take us up.

09:28.290 --> 09:31.880
Caterina, Isabel,
time for dinner.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.620
ELENA: Almost.
Almost.

09:41.620 --> 09:43.170
Almost.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.500
I'm getting really
good at almost.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.670
Come on, Gabe.
Just make one hoop.

09:52.830 --> 09:55.000
The Roberto Rhumba.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.670
I don't know why
I can't get it.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.580
I've seen my dad
do these moves a zillion times.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.460
Those are your dad's moves?

10:07.460 --> 10:09.580
They look better
when he does 'em.

10:09.580 --> 10:10.580
Huh.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.120
Nice move!

10:21.120 --> 10:22.790
Where'd you learn that?

10:22.790 --> 10:25.210
I was just
doin' my job, ya know?

10:25.210 --> 10:27.330
Being a royal guard.
Protecting you.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.580
Well, maybe that's
what you have to do--

10:29.580 --> 10:30.920
take what
you're good at,

10:30.920 --> 10:33.580
and use it to play

11:23.750 --> 11:25.250
How am I supposed
to make a move?

11:25.250 --> 11:27.040
You're a great royal guard,

11:27.040 --> 11:31.170
so think about olaball
the same way you think
about being a guard.

11:31.170 --> 11:33.620
Pretend this ball
is a princess.

11:33.620 --> 11:36.790
She's in danger,
and the hoop is the palace.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.670
You have to make sure
the princess

11:38.670 --> 11:40.580
gets to the palace
safely.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.120
That's a lot to pretend.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.710
Here comes the princess.

11:44.710 --> 11:46.380
Protect the princess, Gabe.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.170
There you go!

11:51.170 --> 11:52.880
Protect the princess.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.290
- That's my first move.
- I love it.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.710
What else you got?

11:56.710 --> 11:58.000
Castle Cannon!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.620
We should call
that last move

13:05.620 --> 13:07.710
the Gabe Goalmaker.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.250
Ooh, I like
the sound of that.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.420
Good, because
we're gonna practice it

13:11.420 --> 13:13.620
until you can
do it in your sleep.

13:13.620 --> 13:14.880
Okay, Coach.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.330
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:22.330 --> 13:25.330
it is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

13:25.330 --> 13:29.960
The Peace Festival
olaball game!

13:33.750 --> 13:37.380
Please welcome the visitors
and defending champions,

13:37.380 --> 13:39.620
Team Cariza!

13:46.920 --> 13:52.920
And our very own
Team Avalor!

13:58.170 --> 14:00.750
- Team Avalor!
- Go, Avalor!

14:00.750 --> 14:03.380
Gabriel.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.250
Over here.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.580
Hey, Papá.

14:06.580 --> 14:07.880
The first time
you get the ball,

14:07.880 --> 14:10.040
do the Roberto Roundhouse
right away.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.790
It'll take 'em
by surprise.

14:11.790 --> 14:14.580
Actually, I've been
practicing some new moves.

14:14.580 --> 14:17.580
You can do those later.
First do the Roundhouse.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.290
Now go out there
and win that trophy.

14:21.830 --> 14:26.580
Okay, let's play
some olaball!

14:32.750 --> 14:34.790
What do you think?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.790
Uh, I'm not really
into sports.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.420
Me neither.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.210
Wanna go discover
a new species of lizard?

14:40.210 --> 14:42.620
I've got
a better idea.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.790
Cat, what are you doing?

14:49.790 --> 14:52.710
You said you wanted
to take a closer look.
Now's our chance.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.750
But I don't know
if we're supposed to.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.670
We'll just go up
for a minute,

14:56.670 --> 14:58.170
then come
right back down.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.580
Okay.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.750
Up we go!

15:04.750 --> 15:06.210
Whoa!

15:08.170 --> 15:09.790
Whoo hoo hoo!

15:09.790 --> 15:10.960
Naomi.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.580
Gabe.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.750
Do the Roberto Roundhouse!
Do it!

15:24.580 --> 15:26.420
Goal, Cariza!

15:26.420 --> 15:27.500
No!

15:30.040 --> 15:33.210
Gabe, I don't remember
practicing that move.

15:33.210 --> 15:34.920
I know. Let's
just keep playing.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.000
Do the Roberto Rhumba.
The Rhumba!

15:48.790 --> 15:49.830
No!!

15:49.830 --> 15:51.830
REFEREE: Two to nothing,
Cariza.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.540
Do the Roberto Rundown.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.250
The what?

15:58.710 --> 16:02.380
Cariza, three,
Avalor, zero.

16:10.210 --> 16:12.620
Oh, so that's
how it works.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.580
The frame unwinds
like a top.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.880
Okay, mystery solved.
Let's go back down.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.290
Already?
But we just got here.

16:19.290 --> 16:23.000
Whoa!
Okay, let's go down.

16:26.790 --> 16:28.000
It's stuck.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.460
Now what do we do?

16:29.460 --> 16:32.500
I don't know.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.960
What happened to
all the moves you
learned yesterday?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.500
My father wanted me
to do his moves.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.750
But his moves
don't work for you.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.210
You have to play
your way.

16:41.210 --> 16:44.580
You're a royal guard,
remember?

16:44.580 --> 16:46.040
Now play like one.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.540
Now slay the dragon.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.830
Dragon Slayer!

17:09.830 --> 17:13.040
- Yes, goal.
Hope is alive!
- We're back!

17:13.040 --> 17:15.790
Nice move, Gabe.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.500
One point for Avalor.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.210
Castle Cannon.

17:31.290 --> 17:33.620
- We scored again.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.210
Avalor, two,
Cariza, three.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.380
Battle Blast.

17:40.380 --> 17:42.290
Belly Bomb!

17:43.790 --> 17:46.580
Did you see that?
Go, Avalor, go, Gabriel!

17:46.580 --> 17:48.620
It's three to three!

17:48.620 --> 17:50.830
We are all tied up.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.420
We could actually win.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.750
We're back in it.

17:54.830 --> 17:56.250
Time's running out.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.920
We have to control
this tip-off

17:59.920 --> 18:01.540
so we can get
the last shot.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.290
- ALL: Team Avalor!

18:14.460 --> 18:15.920
Elena!

18:18.750 --> 18:20.670
Uh-oh. Gabe!

18:20.670 --> 18:22.790
Do the Gabe Goalmaker!

18:36.210 --> 18:37.830
Yes!

18:39.960 --> 18:47.670
Goooooooooal!!

18:50.670 --> 18:53.210
Team Avalor wins!

18:53.210 --> 18:55.750
- We won. Yes!
- We did it!

18:55.750 --> 18:58.330
Team Avalor!

18:58.330 --> 19:02.170
Our hero!

19:02.170 --> 19:04.500
I never doubted you.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.420
Mijo, you are
an olaball star!

19:07.420 --> 19:09.120
Thanks, Papá.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.250
Oh, this is just
the beginning.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.000
We'll get you a trainer,
you'll practice every day.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.830
You'll be on a professional
olaball team in no time,

19:17.830 --> 19:19.250
just like I was.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.620
But I... I already
have a job.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.420
Being a royal guard.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.290
So quit.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.920
I... I, I...

19:32.750 --> 19:35.210
Papá, I don't wanna quit.

19:35.210 --> 19:37.210
I like being
a royal guard.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.790
But you like
olaball better.

19:39.790 --> 19:42.500
No. You like
olaball better.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.670
I joined the team
for you, Papá.

19:44.670 --> 19:47.290
When I tried to
play like you,
I was terrible.

19:47.290 --> 19:50.290
I only got better when
I started playing
like a royal guard.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.500
You love baking
and olaball,

19:52.500 --> 19:55.670
and that's great,
but I love guarding
the kingdom.

19:55.670 --> 19:58.580
That's who I am.
That's my way.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.710
But... but...

20:00.710 --> 20:03.250
CAT AND ISABEL:
Help!!

20:03.250 --> 20:05.330
ELENA: Isabel?

20:05.330 --> 20:07.830
- What's she doing
up there?
- I'm on it.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.960
Hang on, girls.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.620
Be careful, mijo.

20:26.830 --> 20:29.620
Don't worry.
I'll get you down.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.710
All right, you ready to do
the dance of the voladores?

20:35.710 --> 20:39.500
- No.
- It's okay.
I've got you.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.580
GIRLS: Whoo hoo!

20:52.710 --> 20:54.250
Oh, they're safe!

20:54.250 --> 20:57.290
- My hero... again.
- He saved them.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.790
Did you see, Roberto?
Did you see?

20:59.790 --> 21:01.790
I saw.

21:01.790 --> 21:03.790
Dad!

21:03.790 --> 21:06.000
Oh, Caterina.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.170
- Isa.
- I'm sorry, abuela.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.420
I know I shouldn't
have gone up there.

21:10.420 --> 21:13.000
I'm just glad
you're okay.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.580
- Gabriel Nuñez.
- Papá.

21:15.580 --> 21:18.710
You risked your life
to save those girls
without a second thought.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.250
You knew exactly
what to do, and you
did it perfectly.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.580
Yeah.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.920
You were meant
to be a royal guard.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.000
I'm sorry
it took me so long,

21:29.000 --> 21:30.960
but now I see it.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.460
I... see you.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.790
Pardon me.

21:37.790 --> 21:40.580
I want to offer
my eternal gratitude

21:40.580 --> 21:43.540
for the bravery
you have shown today.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.960
I think this should
go home with you, Gabe.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.920
You've earned it.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.790
Thank you, princess...
for everything.

21:50.790 --> 21:53.580
Papá, I know the perfect
spot for this in the bakery.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.170
I don't need a trophy
to be proud of my son.

21:56.170 --> 21:58.000
I'll take it.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.880
But I think I know
the spot you mean.
