00:19.595 --> 00:21.353

Hey, Connor, listen,

00:43.227 --> 00:45.769
I-I know you guys are
going through some stuff,

00:45.771 --> 00:49.548

in my apartment forever, okay?

-You have to talk to her.
<i> -Well, she won't talk</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:54.778
to me. I think
it's her crazy pregnancy brain.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.630
Please don't tell me you used
those exact words with her.

00:56.632 --> 00:59.207
Well, if you did,
it would explain some things.

00:59.209 --> 01:00.300
Why don't you talk to her?

01:00.302 --> 01:03.287
Ah, listen, not my wife,
not my baby.

01:03.289 --> 01:04.955
Well, technically...

<i> Hey, don't even go there.</i>

01:06.383 --> 01:09.384

you're having a kid now.

and find a way
to be honest with Kameron

01:14.241 --> 01:15.723
-about how you really feel.
-Buck?

01:15.725 --> 01:17.484

to any... Uh...
<i> -Buck, don't hang up.</i>

just a telemarketer.

Yeah, I got you.
Uh, come on.

01:24.901 --> 01:25.976

-No.

packing time, not playtime.

-Oh--
-I know.

01:49.668 --> 01:52.444
This place looks like
a bomb exploded. I'm so sorry.

01:52.446 --> 01:56.097
No, no, no, not judging.
The kitchen's probably worse.

01:56.099 --> 01:57.616
Okay, what do we still need
to get together?

01:57.618 --> 02:01.011
Uh, Tristan is packing up
his bathroom stuff,

02:01.013 --> 02:03.530
Stephanie still has pants
in the dryer.

her red sneakers.

no running in the house!

-Hey, no!
-KAREN: Ugh!

02:18.864 --> 02:21.047
You'd think by now we'd have
the packing routine figured out.

02:21.049 --> 02:22.366
I don't think
there's really such a thing

02:22.368 --> 02:24.050

02:24.052 --> 02:25.126
You might be right about that.

Oh, I<i> am</i> right.
I also think

02:27.297 --> 02:31.208
you secretly thrive
on the chaos.

02:31.210 --> 02:33.134
It's how I grew up.

02:33.136 --> 02:34.636
Kids running around the house
all day long,

02:34.638 --> 02:37.047
you know, playing games,
getting into trouble.

02:37.049 --> 02:40.233
There's something comforting
about the chaos of a full house.

02:40.235 --> 02:42.494
(inhales) If you say so.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.388
Pretend all you want,

02:44.390 --> 02:46.331

who loves the crazy.

-Okay, you got me.
-Mm-hmm.

02:48.410 --> 02:51.228

I secretly love it, too.
-Hmm.

02:51.230 --> 02:53.063
You know, we're lucky that way.

02:53.065 --> 02:55.232
-All right.
-Yeah, even luckier,

-Take a picture so we can...
-Firefighter Han.

03:22.928 --> 03:24.036
I was gonna save this

03:24.038 --> 03:25.687

but why not make it

03:25.689 --> 03:27.097
the first order of business?

to that weather update.

All right,
apparatus maintenance.

Firefighter Diaz will be
running point this morning

Kameron, I don't know why
he's calling you.

you'll find...

Um, I got to go.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.410
Uh, s-sor... sorry, Cap. Um...

04:05.412 --> 04:07.395
-All right, folks, listen up.
-Uh, Cap?

04:07.397 --> 04:10.156
Can I just say, if Buck needs
to get the pregnant lady out

04:10.158 --> 04:12.084
of his apartment,
I do have a two-bedroom

04:12.086 --> 04:13.994

to be on the market, so...

04:13.996 --> 04:15.328

118, it's time to dial it in.

We have a job to do, but in
order to do that job, you have

to be here.
I need precision, I need focus.

04:25.173 --> 04:27.582
But most of all,
I need you to be present.

-Okay. Let's get cracking.

04:30.271 --> 04:34.088

08:55.460 --> 08:58.519
Come on, Mallory! Wake up!
Can you hear me?

08:58.521 --> 09:01.431
-There you go. There you are.
-Jo. Where's Jo? Where's Jo?

09:01.433 --> 09:03.116
Your daughter's gonna be fine.
How are you feeling?

09:03.118 --> 09:05.268
-I don't know.
-Okay.

09:05.270 --> 09:08.104
-Get this collar on her.
-Can you move your arms?

09:08.106 --> 09:09.881
That's good!

09:09.883 --> 09:12.050
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

09:13.962 --> 09:15.445
Movement
in your upper extremities.

09:15.447 --> 09:18.298
-That's a great sign.
-This is bad, isn't it?

09:18.300 --> 09:19.891
Spinal misalignment happens
in crashes like this.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.118
And the effects are often
temporary, okay?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.562
Just got to stay positive, okay?

09:23.564 --> 09:26.231
-CHIMNEY: Your daughter's
outside.
-She's not my daughter.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.125
Jo's mother was my best friend,

09:29.127 --> 09:30.735
and we were taking a trip

09:30.737 --> 09:33.129
-to honor her.
-Well, at least
you're doing it in style.

09:33.131 --> 09:34.739
I love this rig.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.223
She saved me so many times,

09:36.225 --> 09:39.135
and I wanted to do the same
for her little girl.

09:39.137 --> 09:42.063
-But look what I've done now.
-CHIMNEY: Hey,

09:42.065 --> 09:44.916
Mallory,
it's not your fault, okay?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.826
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:46.828 --> 09:50.505
-One, two, three.
-Nice and easy, all right?

09:52.575 --> 09:56.336
Hey, looks like we're getting
you an upgrade, too.

09:56.338 --> 09:58.412
We got you into first class.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.325
Okay, Kinard, Shore, let's get
these cars moved back 100 feet,

10:02.327 --> 10:04.160
-100 feet of clearance.
-Move back!

10:04.162 --> 10:06.271
Back it up!

10:07.165 --> 10:08.498
CHIMNEY:
She's right up here.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.834
-Okay? She's right up here.
-JO: Mallory!

10:10.836 --> 10:12.944
I'm so sorry.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.929
I can't lose you, too.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.263
I'm not going anywhere.

10:16.265 --> 10:18.858
We still have a lot of ground
to cover, okay?

10:18.860 --> 10:20.935
Next time, we'll take the train.

10:20.937 --> 10:24.247
Air support,
you are clear to land.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.798
BUCK:
Possible spinal!

10:33.800 --> 10:34.966
She's coming over now.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.618
Can't get rid of me,
can you, Buckley?

10:37.620 --> 10:40.788
Great to see you again,
for real this time.

10:40.790 --> 10:41.881
CHIMNEY:
Hey, Lucy,

10:41.883 --> 10:43.549
take good care of her, huh?

10:43.551 --> 10:44.792
Will do!

10:44.794 --> 10:46.794
Hey, congrats on the engagement!

10:46.796 --> 10:49.038
Good news travels fast!

10:49.040 --> 10:51.524
Thanks, L.D.!

11:03.555 --> 11:06.147
EDDIE:
Hey, Cap,
think there's a propane stove

11:06.149 --> 11:07.849
in the van.
I'm gonna go check it out.

11:07.851 --> 11:09.292
Good thinking, Eddie.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.657
-MAN: Get out of the way!

11:16.659 --> 11:18.343

So, outdoors.

12:10.046 --> 12:11.229

12:11.231 --> 12:13.732
-Boat.
-Ew. Definitely not boat.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.141
Mm. Indoor.

12:15.143 --> 12:17.068
Uh, ballroom. Loft. Rooftop.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.978
Why is it that every time

12:18.980 --> 12:20.888
you mention
a potential wedding venue,

12:20.890 --> 12:22.131
all I can think is

12:22.133 --> 12:24.242
the potential emergencies
that could ensue?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.745
-Not weird, just our life.

You're too close to the victims.
You know what the protocol is.

19:11.467 --> 19:12.966
You have to inform me
of the protocol,

19:12.968 --> 19:14.226
but you don't have
to enforce it.

19:14.228 --> 19:17.029
-Maddie!
-I can do this.

19:17.899 --> 19:19.732
How can I help?

19:19.734 --> 19:21.475

-or that anyone survived it?
-Both.

And they all can't wait
to get back out there again.

31:54.729 --> 31:58.640

32:11.338 --> 32:13.246
That's the fourth time
you've gone in the last hour.

32:13.248 --> 32:15.799
Well, I have a whole human
leaning on my bladder,

32:15.801 --> 32:18.310
so the struggle is real.

32:19.329 --> 32:20.270
Ow.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.088
-Ow? What was that?
-Um,

32:22.090 --> 32:23.181
I
don't know. Ow, ow,

32:23.183 --> 32:24.942
-ow, ow, ow, ow...
-Uh, was it...

32:24.944 --> 32:26.426
was it a contraction?

32:26.428 --> 32:28.186
Uh, I think so.

32:28.188 --> 32:30.355
Um, I don't know.
I-I felt something earlier,

32:30.357 --> 32:33.175
but it didn't feel like this,
you know.

32:33.177 --> 32:35.026
It wasn't that stro--
Oh, my God!

32:35.028 --> 32:36.511
Uh, okay, why don't
we have you sit down?

32:36.513 --> 32:38.288
-I'm gonna call your doctor.
-I'm in labor.

-You-you don't know that.

This is too early.

Um, okay, it is early, yes,
but it's-it's not too early.

32:45.872 --> 32:48.131
-Sit you down, okay?
-Okay.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.025

-Okay.

that breathing going. In.

-Just breathe.

Uh, you know, I'm gonna call the
paramedics. It's just in case.

33:05.209 --> 33:07.209

labor; it's coming on fast.

-Close. Minutes.

Paramedics are on their way.

Uh, Natalia, you remember
Kameron. She's in labor.

with 911

she's dilated.

-KAMERON: Hi.
-Here you go.

Okay, wait. Um, hello? 911?

34:16.204 --> 34:17.888
Okay, you tell them
she's at nine centimeters.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.447
This baby is not waiting.

34:19.449 --> 34:22.284
NATALIA: Nine centimeters.
The baby is not waiting.

34:22.286 --> 34:24.061
-I can't. I can't.
-Hey, hey, hey, Kam.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.620
You're strong and
you can do this.

34:25.622 --> 34:28.047
I'm gonna need you to push,
okay? Come on, let's go.

34:28.049 --> 34:29.991
There you go.

34:29.993 --> 34:31.643
Okay, Kam. On her head.

34:31.645 --> 34:34.145
There you go, that's great.
That's great.

34:34.147 --> 34:36.314
-(sustained pained cries)
-There you go. I know. I know.

34:36.316 --> 34:38.133
I think this baby might be here
before the paramedics.

34:38.135 --> 34:40.077
Keep on pushing.
We're gonna go again, okay?

34:40.079 --> 34:41.578
Come on, you can do this.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.246
-KAMERON: Okay.
-Hey, hey,
we're right here with you.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.823
You got this.
Come on, Kameron.

Come on, come on.

34:45.900 --> 34:47.309
That's it, I can see a head.

34:47.311 --> 34:48.643
I can see the head.
We're almost there.

34:48.645 --> 34:51.070
-We're almost there.
-I totally screwed this up.

34:51.072 --> 34:52.647
Connor should be here.
I need to wait.

34:52.649 --> 34:54.316
-Is that an option?
-(Kameron crying out)

34:54.318 --> 34:56.760
Uh, no, no, no, it's n...
it's not. Uh...

34:56.762 --> 34:58.002

34:58.004 --> 34:59.245
Right now,
we just need to focus.

34:59.247 --> 35:01.172
Okay?
We need to keep on pushing.

35:01.174 --> 35:02.657
Natalia, I need you
to get scissors

35:02.659 --> 35:04.326
-and something
to clamp the cord.
-Scissors. Okay.

35:04.328 --> 35:05.602
In the kitchen.
Go right now, right now.

Thank you.

I'll never be able to repay you.

36:12.913 --> 36:15.230
You don't have to repay me.

36:15.232 --> 36:17.916
Just have to love that kid.

36:17.918 --> 36:20.385
That's enough.

36:21.329 --> 36:22.470
Yeah.

36:35.861 --> 36:39.270
Uh... yeah, he's...

take him home
within a few weeks, if...

36:42.776 --> 36:44.618
if not sooner.

36:46.763 --> 36:48.371
It's weird.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.390
I've been there
at the end of life

36:50.392 --> 36:54.026
so many times,
but never the beginning.

36:54.028 --> 36:57.196
Yeah. So what'd you think?

36:57.198 --> 36:59.865
That the beginning was way
messier than the end.

36:59.867 --> 37:02.385
Yes, it, uh, it can be.

37:04.965 --> 37:07.307
Are you okay?

37:09.228 --> 37:12.136
I saw the way you looked
at that baby,

37:12.138 --> 37:16.140
and then watched you
give him away.

37:16.142 --> 37:19.811
I mean,
that was always the deal.

37:19.813 --> 37:21.312
NATALIA:
Hmm.

37:21.314 --> 37:24.616
And I still don't understand
why you did that for them.

37:25.893 --> 37:28.328
Because I could.

37:29.656 --> 37:31.748
(Buck chuckles)

37:31.750 --> 37:34.000
Wait a minute.

37:35.069 --> 37:36.419
-You came over tonight.
-(laughs)

37:36.421 --> 37:38.980
I thought you weren't
speaking to me.

37:38.982 --> 37:41.149
I came over to apologize

37:41.151 --> 37:44.427
and to say that
I may have overreacted

37:44.429 --> 37:48.156
when I accused you of having
a very complicated life.

37:48.158 --> 37:49.933
And then you walked in on a...

37:49.935 --> 37:53.311
a woman giving birth
on my couch.

37:56.182 --> 37:59.684
I like you, Buck.

37:59.686 --> 38:01.444
And I'm sorry I ran off.

38:02.764 --> 38:05.189

-Mm.

-Where is everybody?
-Uh, upstairs.

something new.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.252
Take a seat.

38:59.913 --> 39:02.063
Meditation?

39:02.065 --> 39:03.231
This is new.

39:03.233 --> 39:05.717
All right,
let's clear our minds.

39:07.179 --> 39:10.329
What we do here is
as important as any call,

39:10.331 --> 39:13.350
because it keeps us
from becoming the emergency.

39:14.836 --> 39:15.927
So let's close our eyes,

39:15.929 --> 39:19.397
focus in on our breathing.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.196
We can let go
of past traumas.

39:26.198 --> 39:29.348
Can let go of
future expectations,

39:29.350 --> 39:32.369
and allow opportunity
to find us.

39:35.432 --> 39:37.281
That we could probably use
for seating.

39:38.268 --> 39:40.435
Oh, what if we did it
on the patio?

42:02.078 --> 42:05.230
♪<i> Help me to name it...</i> ♪

42:07.100 --> 42:09.692
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:13.014 --> 42:15.256
So what do you want
to do today?

42:15.258 --> 42:18.701
Well, I had a few ideas.

42:22.523 --> 42:25.208
You want to help me pick out
a new couch?

42:25.210 --> 42:26.117
Yeah.

42:26.119 --> 42:27.118
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.936
(both chuckle)

42:28.938 --> 42:31.047
-That's a good idea.
-Mm.

42:34.944 --> 42:36.127
(sighs)

42:36.129 --> 42:37.945
BOBBY:
And now, whenever you're ready,

42:37.947 --> 42:41.558
take one last breath.

42:42.619 --> 42:43.726
(exhales)

42:43.728 --> 42:45.562
(alarm ringing)

42:46.623 --> 42:48.273
Let's go.

42:55.965 --> 42:58.908
I can't believe
we're doing this.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.985
Well, last-minute cancellation.

43:00.987 --> 43:02.245
How could we pass up
this opportunity?

43:02.247 --> 43:04.229
Ooh, and we didn't tell
anyone that we're going.

43:04.231 --> 43:05.898
Well, we'll call 'em
when we get there.

43:05.900 --> 43:07.825
-Ah! Or maybe not.
-(laughs)

43:07.827 --> 43:09.085
