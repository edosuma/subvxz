00:17.684 --> 00:21.939
<i>The 17th century witnessed
a violent and merciless battle</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:25.442
<i>against hideous bloodthirsty creatures</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:28.654
<i>who in the chronicles of that time
were referred to as vampires.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:32.031
<i>Brothers found the courage
to accuse their brothers,</i>

00:32.031 --> 00:33.742
<i>and fathers their children,</i>

00:33.784 --> 00:35.786
<i>lest the Earth never be cleansed</i>

00:35.786 --> 00:38.580
<i>of this horrible race of ferocious murderers.</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:41.250
<i>But before putting them to death,</i>

00:41.291 --> 00:45.087
<i>human justice anticipating divine justice,</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:48.590
<i> branded forever the cursed flesh of those monsters</i>

00:48.674 --> 00:50.843
<i>with the red hot mark of Satan.</i>

01:12.739 --> 01:16.285
Asa, from the lineage of the Princes of Vaida,

01:16.451 --> 01:20.497
the Sacred College of the Primats of Moldavia

01:21.290 --> 01:23.375
has declared you guilty.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.713
I, head of the family of the Princes of Vaida,

01:28.255 --> 01:32.134
in my capacity as Grand Inquisitor, sentence you,

01:32.801 --> 01:36.305
and as your brother I repudiate you.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.559
You have committed many sins

01:40.726 --> 01:43.437
to satisfy your satanic love

01:43.687 --> 01:47.900
for that servant of the Devil,
Igor Javutich.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.361
May God have mercy

01:51.445 --> 01:53.197
on your soul

01:53.405 --> 01:55.407
in this supreme moment.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.160
Cover her face

01:58.243 --> 02:00.370
with the mask of the Devil.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.497
Nail it down!

02:04.041 --> 02:07.711
May the cleansing flames
reduce her to ashes

02:08.002 --> 02:12.508
so that the wind will obliterate
all traces of her existence.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.620
Griabby!

02:41.912 --> 02:44.081
It is I who repudiate you,

02:44.206 --> 02:47.709
It is I who curses you in the name of the Devil.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.296
Go ahead, nail me down!

02:51.380 --> 02:55.300
You will never escape my claws,
nor those of Satan

02:57.010 --> 03:01.598
The unchained elements of the power
of darkness are ready to strike you

03:01.682 --> 03:03.183
Beware, Griabby!

03:03.392 --> 03:04.601
My vengeance

03:04.601 --> 03:06.895
will strike down you and your offspring,

03:07.020 --> 03:10.899
because in the blood of your
sons and the sons of your sons

03:10.983 --> 03:13.402
I will continue to live, immortal!

03:14.111 --> 03:18.615
They will restore to me the
life that you now take from me.

03:18.699 --> 03:23.912
I shall return to torment and
destroy throughout the night of time.

03:43.807 --> 03:49.313
MASK OF THE DEVIL

05:24.783 --> 05:27.202
As if by the Devil's command,

05:27.286 --> 05:29.204
the sudden fury of the elements

05:29.288 --> 05:32.291
extinguishes the purifying flames.

05:33.792 --> 05:38.297
The terrified people run from that cursed place.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.090
And for all that long night,

05:40.215 --> 05:45.387
the churchbells toll to keep away the spirits of evil.

05:50.309 --> 05:54.605
When the storm dies down, Javutich's body

05:54.688 --> 05:57.482
is buried in unconsecrated ground

05:57.608 --> 06:00.194
in the graveyard for murderers.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.114
And the corpse of the witch

06:04.198 --> 06:06.909
is placed in the tomb of her ancestors.

06:14.791 --> 06:19.296
TWO CENTURIES LATER

06:20.297 --> 06:22.090
Coachman!

06:22.508 --> 06:25.010
How much further is it to the crossroads of Mirgorod?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.013
Six or seven versts, sir.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.806
Did you hear that, Professor?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.600
If we stop at Mirgorod, we'll never

06:31.683 --> 06:33.519
be able to reach Moscow by evening.

06:33.602 --> 06:36.605
Yes, but it doesn't matter. We'll
spend the night at the inn at Mirgorod,

06:36.688 --> 06:38.690
with good smoked salmon and excellent vodka.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.485
We will arrive at the Congress tomorrow.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.780
But we'll miss the inauguration

06:45.781 --> 06:49.910
and Professor Blistanov of Saint Petersburg's speech.
It's such a pity.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.579
How long have you had your degree?

06:52.788 --> 06:55.707
For three years, and I have been assisting you for two.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.293
When you have been in this profession twenty years,

06:58.502 --> 07:02.297
you'll learn the true value of
the small talk of the Congress.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.015
Take the road through the
forest, it's much shorter.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.518
That is a bad route,
no one takes it anymore.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.687
You are afraid of the witch

07:17.187 --> 07:20.899
Afraid, no.
I fought against Napoleon,

07:21.108 --> 07:22.818
but to tell you the truth,

07:23.318 --> 07:27.990
I'd rather find myself face-to-face with
that Frenchman than to meet up with a ghost.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.702
This will help you to forget the ghosts.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.620
Come on, let's get going.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.610
What's causing that strange sound?

08:05.194 --> 08:07.613
It's nothing, just the wind in the trees.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.699
What's going on?

08:10.908 --> 08:14.286
The trees are extending their branches to strangle me!

08:14.494 --> 08:18.081
Try not to strangle yourself with that vodka.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.309
Why is he driving so fast?

08:38.602 --> 08:41.313
I guess it's a combination

08:43.607 --> 08:48.487
of my tip and his fear...

08:48.820 --> 08:50.197
Is it serious?

08:50.280 --> 08:55.118
No, no. Fortunately, it just slipped out
of the socket. I'll have it fixed in no time.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.119
Very well.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.206
It certainly isn't very cheerful here,

08:59.414 --> 09:00.916
and there's that sound on top of it...

09:02.417 --> 09:04.795
It's coming from there. Let's see what it is.

09:48.380 --> 09:53.093
That solves the mystery!
It's the wind in the pipes of this broken-down organ.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.890
What is happening, your Lordship?

09:58.015 --> 10:00.684
Nothing! Continue your work!

11:14.007 --> 11:18.011
More than a thousand years of battles, hates, and loves.

11:18.387 --> 11:21.515
Now there's nothing but dust in these tombs.

11:22.391 --> 11:27.187
Only the memories of old exploits remain here.

11:27.479 --> 11:31.817
The history of ancient Moldavia
is caught in these stones.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.295
Andreï, come here!

11:56.717 --> 12:00.012
It's the witch of the old legend.
Do you see this bronze mask?

12:00.095 --> 12:02.014
It was always placed on the
face of a condemned witch

12:02.681 --> 12:05.601
So she shall wear for all eternity her true face.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.187
And why is this window there?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.981
They thought that the witch might rise again,

12:11.190 --> 12:15.485
and that the cross visible through the glass
would keep her nailed down forever.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.404
Hey, my Lords!

12:19.114 --> 12:23.202
Where are you? I need someone
to come and give me a hand!

12:23.285 --> 12:24.995
Gentlemen, please don't leave me alone

12:25.120 --> 12:26.788
in this infernal place.

12:29.583 --> 12:33.504
He is frightened to death. Go and help him, will you?
I want to have another look around.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.714
Sure, I prefer it outside anyway.

12:35.714 --> 12:39.301
There's no air in here, and it's a bit gloomy.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.390
Professor!

13:27.391 --> 13:29.393
Professor Kruvajan,
What is happening?

13:29.518 --> 13:30.811
Why did you fire?
-Look here.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.605
It threw itself at me.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.108
That's very strange.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.194
Usually bats fly away from human beings.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.907
Let's go, Professor,
we'll be better off outside.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.785
Otherwise the coachman will be convinced he is right.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.495
Wait.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.805
What are you doing?

14:10.893 --> 14:13.520
Almost intact after two centuries.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.690
Professor, you are injured.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.610
Actually, I hadn't noticed it.

14:20.319 --> 14:23.906
A splinter of glass, just a few drops of blood...

14:25.407 --> 14:27.993
Those empty eyes seem to be looking at us.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.793
Let's go.

15:26.301 --> 15:29.388
Who are you?
What do you want?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.808
I am Professor Choma Kruvajan,

15:33.016 --> 15:35.811
and this is my assistant...

15:36.186 --> 15:38.105
Dr. Andreï Gorobek.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.900
I was walking in the park
when I heard a shot.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.819
Why?

15:44.111 --> 15:46.488
I killed a bat down in the crypt.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.409
You must excuse us for taking
the liberty of entering the chapel.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.703
We thought it was an abandoned ruin,

15:52.911 --> 15:55.581
and we couldn't resist our curiosity.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.791
It's all so strange

15:58.417 --> 15:59.710
and mysterious here.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.880
Everything is going to ruins here.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.216
My father, Prince Vaida,

16:06.300 --> 16:09.094
Refuses to repair even this old chapel.

16:10.304 --> 16:13.015
This place, in his eyes, is cursed.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.100
My Lords, the wheel is
ready, we can go now.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.603
We're coming.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.105
Please excuse us,
Princess, but we have to go.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.399
We still have five versts between us and Mirgorod.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.985
We are spending the night there.

16:25.986 --> 16:30.616
Allow me not to say 'goodbye'
to you, I hope to see you again...

16:31.408 --> 16:36.914
Thank you. I trust you will
spend a good night at Mirgorod.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.382
Did she bewitch you?

17:30.008 --> 17:31.802
What sadness in her eyes!

17:35.013 --> 17:36.098
And this?

17:41.103 --> 17:43.313
A souvenir of the witch.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.314
What a strange sound.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.609
Like a voice breaking off.

19:58.282 --> 20:01.410
Wolves!
That's why in the forest today

20:01.451 --> 20:04.288
we couldn't find any tracks of wild deer.

20:05.289 --> 20:08.083
No, it's a different kind of howling.

20:10.586 --> 20:11.920
Those are not wolves.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.303
The gryphon moved.

20:20.888 --> 20:23.390
Constantin! Katia!

20:23.515 --> 20:24.183
-What is it?
-Father?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.101
It wasn't painted like this, was it?

20:26.185 --> 20:28.687
It was alive for a moment,
now it's dead again.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.689
-What are you saying?
-I'm certain of it.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.609
Yes, Father is right, it
wasn't in that position before.

20:33.692 --> 20:36.987
Katia, you were always impressed by that portrait,

20:37.196 --> 20:38.405
I don't know why.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.908
That portrait is like a smoldering fire;

20:41.116 --> 20:42.701
it burns with a mysterious secret life.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.621
There is something different

20:45.621 --> 20:47.498
about her eyes, her hands...

20:48.081 --> 20:50.918
Sometimes I'm afraid to go near it.

20:50.918 --> 20:51.919
Katia,

20:53.504 --> 20:55.506
Constantin must be right.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.217
My imagination is playing tricks on me.

21:02.221 --> 21:03.805
Let's not talk about it anymore.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.188
How cold it is.

21:12.105 --> 21:16.109
The chill that seems to come out of the
fireplace tonight penetrates my bones.

21:16.401 --> 21:19.780
Why don't you get some sleep, Father?
Your eyes are tired.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.491
My eyes aren't tired...

21:23.283 --> 21:24.785
my spirit is.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.996
Go, go... I want to be alone now.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.206
Good night.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.292
Good night.

22:12.416 --> 22:13.417
Good night, my Lord.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.710
No, wait...

22:16.420 --> 22:19.089
How many years have you
been serving in this house?

22:19.214 --> 22:20.591
I was born here, my Lord.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.801
Today is the feast of Saint George.

22:24.386 --> 22:28.098
Do you know the legend of the
curse that was placed on this castle?

22:28.891 --> 22:33.187
Two centuries ago today, two people
were executed for practicing witchcraft.

22:33.312 --> 22:35.314
Princess Asa and her lover and accomplice,

22:35.480 --> 22:38.609
Prince Javutich. The mask of Satan
was nailed forever to their faces.

22:40.319 --> 22:44.781
One century later, an earthquake
destroyed only the ancient chapel

22:44.907 --> 22:47.201
and the witch's sarcophagus was found split open,

22:47.284 --> 22:50.496
as if Asa was trying to break
out and accomplish her revenge.

22:50.621 --> 22:53.290
In fact, on that night,
Princess Macha

22:53.790 --> 22:55.918
died mysteriously.

22:57.294 --> 23:01.381
Beautiful Macha... the very image of the witch.

23:05.511 --> 23:07.387
She was just twenty-one that day...

23:09.681 --> 23:10.766
Like Katia.

23:12.017 --> 23:14.019
And Katia is her living image.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.981
As if the witch chooses her victims and torments

23:17.981 --> 23:20.609
them with her own beauty before killing them.

23:20.692 --> 23:24.279
It is this resemblance, this echoing
vengeance of Asa

23:24.321 --> 23:25.280
that terrifies me.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.698
I am afraid, Ivan.

23:26.782 --> 23:30.702
You musn't be afraid, my Lord.
The cross will protect you.

23:30.911 --> 23:35.791
Even if what you say is true, these
creatures are terrified by the symbol of Christ.

23:36.208 --> 23:38.001
Always keep it near you
and you will be safe.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.753
Yes. You are right, Ivan.

23:40.212 --> 23:43.882
It is the atmosphere surrounding
this cursed day that has upset me so.

23:45.384 --> 23:47.803
Drink this, my Lord, before it gets cold.

24:05.529 --> 24:06.738
It's Death!

24:07.239 --> 24:07.990
I have just seen Death!

24:09.324 --> 24:10.242
It's a warning.

24:11.118 --> 24:13.662
I will defend myself!
They won't win!

24:13.996 --> 24:16.498
They won't win against the symbol of Christ!

25:22.898 --> 25:25.108
-Everything alright, sir?
-Yes, thank you.

25:25.317 --> 25:28.487
You were right, Professor,
this vodka is superb.

25:28.487 --> 25:30.697
Right now I feel as if I could conquer the world.

25:31.114 --> 25:35.911
Start with the castle. If I am not mistaken,
someone made quite an impression on you.

25:36.119 --> 25:39.581
An excellent idea!
Another glass or two...

25:42.084 --> 25:44.419
...and that's exactly where I'll go.

25:44.795 --> 25:49.216
You'd be wiser to go to sleep.
Mysterious princesses are easier to conquer in dreams.

25:49.383 --> 25:51.385
Besides, we must be up early tomorrow.

25:51.593 --> 25:52.886
You're right.

25:53.887 --> 25:55.597
I'll tell them to wake us at five.

25:55.681 --> 25:59.810
No, I'll do it. I will take a little
walk and inform our hostess.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.395
Alright, good night.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.190
And watch out for bats!

26:06.191 --> 26:07.818
Watch out for your head!

26:21.081 --> 26:23.709
-Why is it always the same story with you?
-I don't want to go there.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.503
And who do you think should go?
Me, with all the things I have to do?

26:26.712 --> 26:29.882
Excuse me, sir, isn't it
shameful that a girl of her age

26:30.090 --> 26:32.301
is afraid to go by herself
to milk the cow in the barn?

26:32.509 --> 26:33.510
Your mother is right.

26:33.594 --> 26:36.513
Yes, but the barn is right
beside the old cemetery.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.308
Don't be afraid of the dead.
They hurt nobody.

26:39.516 --> 26:41.393
Did you hear what the gentleman said?

26:41.602 --> 26:43.687
I'm coming!
Now hurry, I'm busy.

26:43.896 --> 26:44.980
I've been waiting for half an hour.

26:45.105 --> 26:47.191
I'll go tonight, but tomorrow I won't.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.802
Hello, Irina.

28:43.932 --> 28:46.101
Javutich!

28:47.186 --> 28:48.645
Javutich!

28:49.229 --> 28:52.482
Javutich, rise!

29:25.098 --> 29:28.810
It's OK, Irina, be still...
are you frightened too?

29:31.813 --> 29:33.482
What a storm!

35:01.101 --> 35:02.019
Papa,

35:06.815 --> 35:07.900
Papa, what is happening?

35:08.108 --> 35:10.986
It's me, Katia.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.280
We must find a doctor, but where?

35:13.614 --> 35:14.698
At the inn.

35:15.407 --> 35:19.495
I met two doctors in front of the chapel today,
they said they were staying at Mirgorod.

35:19.536 --> 35:21.788
Hurry, Ivan! Go down and wake up the groom!

35:21.914 --> 35:23.707
I'm here, master! What is happening?

35:23.916 --> 35:26.084
Go to the inn and get one of the
doctors who is staying there.

36:09.086 --> 36:10.879
Doctor Kruvajan!

36:12.297 --> 36:17.594
Princess Vaida sent me. She
begs you to come to the castle.

36:18.220 --> 36:20.389
I'll come, but first I'll have to notify the innkeepers.

36:20.514 --> 36:21.306
You won't need to.

36:21.515 --> 36:24.601
I have already done so.
They told me

36:24.810 --> 36:26.019
where to find you.

36:27.896 --> 36:29.106
In that case...

41:55.682 --> 41:57.017
Kruvajan!

42:00.854 --> 42:01.980
Kruvajan!

42:02.523 --> 42:03.982
I have been waiting for you.

42:11.114 --> 42:13.283
I need you again.

42:13.784 --> 42:15.494
Look into my eyes.

42:17.579 --> 42:19.289
Look into my eyes!

42:20.791 --> 42:22.251
Come closer.

42:22.251 --> 42:25.420
Just a few drops of your blood

42:25.587 --> 42:27.005
brought me to life again.

42:27.214 --> 42:31.510
All of your blood will give me the
strength to accomplish my vengeance.

42:32.302 --> 42:35.013
Come... embrace me.

42:35.597 --> 42:38.809
My lips will transform you.

42:46.233 --> 42:50.904
You will be dead to men,
but you'll be alive in death.

43:40.037 --> 43:41.079
Be quiet.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.584
What's keeping Boris so long?

43:45.709 --> 43:48.587
He will come.
Have courage, Katia.

43:52.007 --> 43:55.219
The griffon...
The man in the painting...

43:55.802 --> 43:58.514
-What's he saying?
-He's delirious.

44:00.349 --> 44:02.392
Only the crucifix can save us.

44:04.019 --> 44:07.105
In this day of... damnation.

44:16.615 --> 44:18.200
Did you send for me?

44:20.786 --> 44:23.497
Thank you very much for coming,
Doctor. He looks really bad.

44:23.580 --> 44:26.083
We will see.
You may go now.

45:00.284 --> 45:01.410
What's wrong with him, Doctor?

45:01.952 --> 45:04.496
Nothing serious.
He has just been very emotional.

45:04.538 --> 45:08.083
We were asleep when all of
a sudden we heard him scream.

45:08.083 --> 45:11.211
He was trembling, lying here with his arm
outstretched, holding this cross...

45:11.295 --> 45:14.256
...holding this cross as if trying to
drive back some horrible apparition.

45:14.298 --> 45:15.382
Don't show it.

45:16.550 --> 45:19.595
If he sees it again, it might
provoke another attack.

45:21.013 --> 45:25.309
Eternity has been broken.
You were able to do it!

45:25.601 --> 45:29.188
You tore me out of the
earth, heavy as lead.

45:29.396 --> 45:31.690
You won't be alone anymore.

45:31.982 --> 45:36.195
I will bring you her body,
she will be your prey.

45:36.487 --> 45:41.617
She was born for this fate.
She is your living image.

45:41.700 --> 45:44.203
Destiny has its way, Asa.

45:44.995 --> 45:46.788
In her you will live again,

45:47.498 --> 45:50.417
speak again,
and smile as she does.

45:51.376 --> 45:54.880
We will live once more, as we used to.

46:09.520 --> 46:12.189
Go have some rest, Constantin.
Father is quiet now.

46:12.314 --> 46:13.398
No, I'm not tired.

46:13.482 --> 46:15.984
Go, both of you.
I will stay here.

46:17.110 --> 46:19.780
Oh dear, the tormented barking of those dogs...

46:19.905 --> 46:22.616
-Ivan, try to quiet them.
-Yes, my Lady.

46:22.699 --> 46:25.410
Go, Constantin.
I'll sit up with him.

46:26.620 --> 46:28.997
-I'll call you if necessary.
-As you wish.

46:36.046 --> 46:39.675
What's the matter?
Quiet now!

47:22.551 --> 47:28.682
Why don't you go to bed now?
I'll stay here and watch over your father.

47:29.308 --> 47:32.102
But aren't you leaving tomorrow at dawn?

47:33.395 --> 47:35.481
Don't worry, I'll stay with him all night long.

47:42.029 --> 47:43.989
He is much calmer now, isn't he?

47:44.114 --> 47:48.785
Yes, he will be sleeping quietly the
rest of the night. You needn't worry.

47:49.119 --> 47:52.915
Go and have some rest
yourself now, you'll need it.

47:52.998 --> 47:55.584
Doctor, I don't know how to thank you.

47:55.709 --> 47:58.295
Call me if you need anything.

47:58.420 --> 47:59.713
I'm sure it won't be necessary.

48:00.297 --> 48:02.508
Your room is across the corridor here.

48:02.799 --> 48:04.510
Goodnight, and thank you again.

48:04.593 --> 48:05.802
Goodnight.

49:12.703 --> 49:13.787
Poor Father!

49:16.415 --> 49:17.583
Doctor Kruvajan!

49:21.587 --> 49:24.006
Katia wait!
Don't go in there!

49:25.507 --> 49:27.301
Don't look!

49:31.388 --> 49:32.806
Professor Kruvajan?

49:37.019 --> 49:38.103
It's me, Andreï.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.398
Your friend has already left.

49:41.815 --> 49:42.900
Left?

49:43.317 --> 49:45.694
Last night he was called to the castle. It seems

49:45.819 --> 49:48.697
that Prince Vaida was suddenly taken very ill.

49:48.780 --> 49:50.199
He hasn't come back.

49:50.616 --> 49:52.284
And why didn't he notify me?

49:52.409 --> 49:54.119
Maybe he didn't want to disturb you.

49:54.286 --> 49:58.081
My daughter saw him get into the coach
that came from the castle to pick him up.

49:58.707 --> 50:01.502
-Could I have a horse?
-Right away. Come with me.

50:08.592 --> 50:11.595
Be careful! If you knock
down the basket I'll spank you!

50:15.390 --> 50:16.892
Excuse me!

50:17.184 --> 50:19.186
Is this the shortcut to the castle?

50:19.311 --> 50:22.689
Yes, sir.
Take the road going uphill.

50:25.192 --> 50:28.987
Damn it, I told you to play someplace else!

50:31.114 --> 50:34.117
A shirt!
We have to catch it!

50:34.284 --> 50:36.703
Be careful you don't fall into the water too!

51:12.030 --> 51:12.990
Doctor Kruvajan!

51:32.342 --> 51:33.177
Who are you?

51:33.677 --> 51:34.720
What do you want?

51:35.220 --> 51:36.680
I am Doctor Gorobek.

51:37.347 --> 51:40.058
I heard that Doctor Kruvajan
was brought here last night.

51:40.601 --> 51:42.352
That is correct.

51:42.811 --> 51:46.023
We called him to attend to my
father, who had fallen ill suddenly.

51:46.398 --> 51:49.860
The doctor was left alone
with him, but then he left.

51:50.068 --> 51:54.364
If he hadn't abandoned him,
my father might still be alive.

51:54.907 --> 51:59.453
The behaviour of your colleague
is really incomprehensible.

52:00.162 --> 52:01.246
You're right.

52:01.914 --> 52:06.126
I don't know how to explain it, but I assure
you this comes to me as a great surprise.

52:06.543 --> 52:09.087
I know Doctor Kruvajan very well,

52:10.464 --> 52:11.965
and I don't understand...

52:12.382 --> 52:14.718
Something serious must have
happened, I'm sure of it.

52:16.094 --> 52:19.765
It is very strange. He
hasn't returned to the inn.

52:20.015 --> 52:21.266
He hasn't returned?

52:22.809 --> 52:24.061
Please, come up.

52:26.855 --> 52:29.399
Oh my god! It's Boris,
the groom from the Vaida's.

52:29.483 --> 52:31.443
What's going on, mama?
Nothing.

52:31.527 --> 52:35.781
Yes, it's him, and what a state he's in!
How did he end up here?

52:35.948 --> 52:38.075
The current. He is dead.

52:56.301 --> 52:58.637
Let's take her away from here.
Where is her room?

52:58.720 --> 52:59.805
Come.

53:15.279 --> 53:16.697
Quickly, some water.

54:13.086 --> 54:14.588
His face has changed completely.

54:14.796 --> 54:18.509
It's very scary, it looks like the face of the Devil.
It made me sick looking at it.

54:18.717 --> 54:21.303
Horrible! It's as if the Devil
had devoured him from within.

54:21.512 --> 54:24.890
Speak quietly, it's better
that they don't know yet.

54:25.098 --> 54:27.017
They are already grief-stricken
enough by their father's death.

54:27.893 --> 54:29.019
Ivan! What's this all about?

54:29.102 --> 54:32.397
They found Boris' body in the stream, my Lord.

54:32.606 --> 54:33.690
Boris' body?

54:33.899 --> 54:37.611
Yes, and in a terrible state.
His eyes are popping out of their sockets,

54:37.653 --> 54:39.988
his teeth are exposed,
and his hands are contorted.

54:41.114 --> 54:42.199
Where is he?

54:43.492 --> 54:46.912
We've carried him into the sacristy.
The parish priest is with him.

54:47.287 --> 54:47.996
You there...

54:48.997 --> 54:49.915
Me?

54:50.207 --> 54:51.500
Yes, come here.

54:54.503 --> 54:58.382
Is it true that you saw the carriage that came
to fetch Doctor Kruvajan yesterday evening?

54:58.590 --> 55:02.010
Yes, my Lord.
I saw it when it left the stable.

55:02.219 --> 55:04.388
When I heard the
noise, I hid myself.

55:04.805 --> 55:08.100
But it wasn't Boris who was driving
the coach. I know him well.

55:09.101 --> 55:11.186
It was a stranger,
an unknown face.

55:12.104 --> 55:13.188
Are you sure?

55:13.397 --> 55:14.898
Yes, my Lord.

55:15.607 --> 55:17.818
I'm going to the village to see Boris' corpse.

55:18.485 --> 55:22.197
And you come with me. You must tell
me everything. Everything that you saw.

55:22.614 --> 55:25.409
Do you understand?
It's very important.

55:25.492 --> 55:27.119
Certainly sir, I'll tell you everything.

55:29.121 --> 55:31.915
Come on now, go back to the village.

55:33.417 --> 55:34.585
It's him!

55:35.502 --> 55:37.296
Yes, it's him!

55:37.713 --> 55:40.507
It's the man who came last night
to get Doctor Kruvajan.

55:40.716 --> 55:43.010
I swear it, my Lord, it's definitely him!

55:43.218 --> 55:47.181
I am certain of it!
The moon was shining on his face.

55:47.306 --> 55:48.182
Airy chatter!

55:48.390 --> 55:53.520
Fantasies about a portrait of someone
who has been lying dead for centuries!

55:53.687 --> 55:55.814
We're all going insane!

55:56.398 --> 55:58.108
Calm yourself, Princess.

55:58.901 --> 56:01.111
I am going to the
village, but I'll be back.

56:01.487 --> 56:02.779
Gather your courage.

56:02.905 --> 56:05.699
Why don't you stay the night here, Doctor?

56:09.119 --> 56:11.914
Yes, I beg you.
We will all feel calmer.

56:26.011 --> 56:27.221
Unbelievable!

56:28.013 --> 56:30.891
The same horrible death as the prince.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.394
The wounds on his neck look like
the work of a wild beast...

56:34.603 --> 56:37.815
...but one that punctures
the flesh without tearing it.

56:38.982 --> 56:42.611
I am a doctor, and I only
believe in Science. But this...

56:45.489 --> 56:48.283
And what about Professor Kruvajan?

56:48.784 --> 56:50.619
Is it possible that a man such as he

56:50.786 --> 56:54.706
could abandon a patient without saying anything?

56:57.000 --> 57:00.587
I passed by the inn, but no one had seen him.

57:00.712 --> 57:04.383
Moreover, the inkeeper's daughter swore
that the man in the portrait at the castle

57:04.716 --> 57:08.595
is the same as the driver of the coach
who came last night to fetch the Professor.

57:09.513 --> 57:11.181
I don't know how to explain it.

57:11.390 --> 57:13.308
A man in a portrait, you say?

57:14.518 --> 57:16.395
Yes, the portrait hanging near the fireplace.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.689
A painting that is two centuries old.

57:19.314 --> 57:22.818
Of a man dressed in black with a griffon on his chest?

57:22.901 --> 57:24.403
Yes, why?

57:29.700 --> 57:31.493
Oh... nothing...

57:38.083 --> 57:39.418
Oh, Father,

57:39.918 --> 57:42.588
The Prince would like you to
prepare the funeral for tomorrow.

57:43.297 --> 57:46.383
Very well. Everything will
be ready tomorrow morning.

58:20.584 --> 58:21.585
come!

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:10.319
Help me!

01:00:11.612 --> 01:00:12.905
What is happening?

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:14.490
What's the matter, Princess?

01:00:14.615 --> 01:00:16.992
-There is someone in my room!
-Where?

01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:18.911
-Behind the curtain!
-Let's go!

01:00:18.994 --> 01:00:20.621
Ivan, keep guard over the stairway.

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:25.501
Over there, behind the curtain.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.094
-There's nobody there.
-You must have imagined it.

01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:39.806
No, I saw a hand, reflected in the mirror.

01:00:41.183 --> 01:00:45.312
Don't you believe me? I saw it!

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:48.106
I'll go and get a sedative.

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:08.293
Professor Kruvajan!
You frightened me.

01:01:08.418 --> 01:01:09.711
Where have you been?

01:01:11.797 --> 01:01:13.799
I have been searching for you all day.

01:01:15.717 --> 01:01:16.802
Your hair...

01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:20.806
Go away, Andreï.

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:24.017
Don't get involved in things that don't concern you.

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:28.397
Since you didn't come back to the inn,
I brought your luggage here for you.

01:01:28.981 --> 01:01:30.190
Look...

01:01:30.315 --> 01:01:33.819
I was trying to decipher the inscription.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:39.491
Professor!

01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:05.309
Krug! Brug!

01:02:07.895 --> 01:02:09.104
They carry the signs.

01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:12.691
Yes... and I think that maybe...

01:02:13.484 --> 01:02:15.110
Come, quickly.

01:02:15.486 --> 01:02:19.615
Carry everything into the
salon for the funeral service.

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:22.117
Take this. Carefully.

01:02:22.493 --> 01:02:24.995
He fled from you as if possessed?

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.788
Yes, the moment I showed him the icon.

01:02:27.206 --> 01:02:29.291
He disappeared without any explanation.

01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:35.506
It's very difficult to translate
these ancient Cyrillic inscriptions.

01:02:36.507 --> 01:02:38.509
We have to find the keyword.

01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:44.097
Let me take it along to the library, where
I can compare it with some texts I have.

01:02:44.181 --> 01:02:45.015
At your disposal.

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:46.517
My Father...

01:02:46.892 --> 01:02:50.521
My sister has been suffering
terribly from all this,

01:02:50.604 --> 01:02:55.609
I would really appreciate it if you
would urge her to leave the castle.

01:02:56.193 --> 01:02:58.403
I tried to convince
her, but in vain...

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.909
Princess!

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.206
I hope I'm not intruding...

01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:55.294
No, I just feel so desperate and alone.

01:03:56.086 --> 01:03:58.213
I understand, but you mustn't despair.

01:03:58.505 --> 01:04:02.217
You must always have
faith. In yourself, in life.

01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:04.511
In life?

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.389
What is my life? Sadness and grief.

01:04:08.015 --> 01:04:10.684
Something that destroys itself, bit by bit.

01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:12.603
And no one can rebuild it.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.982
Here is the very image of my life.

01:04:17.608 --> 01:04:18.817
Look at it...

01:04:19.693 --> 01:04:22.696
it is being consumed, hour
by hour, like this garden.

01:04:25.407 --> 01:04:28.494
Destined for a life without purpose.

01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:32.498
Even if all Mankind abandons this castle,

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:34.416
or even deserts these grounds,

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:36.585
there is no reason why you should do

01:04:36.793 --> 01:04:39.087
likewise with your life and your youth.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:44.510
Go far away from here, and
you'll be happy again, Katia.

01:04:45.886 --> 01:04:48.013
Forgive me if I call you by name.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.517
And remember that I'll always be ready to help you.

01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:54.812
You're very kind, Andreï,

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.689
but today everything seems so hopeless.

01:04:57.898 --> 01:05:01.485
I feel a sense of terror,
a premonition of death

01:05:02.903 --> 01:05:05.781
that tortures me without giving
me a single moment of peace.

01:05:07.115 --> 01:05:09.117
If only I had your strength, your faith.

01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:12.204
You mustn't despair.

01:05:12.913 --> 01:05:15.707
Lately everything must
seem very confusing to you.

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:17.209
But even here, in this garden,

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:21.713
the Sun will reach into the darkest corners
and chase away the shadows of the night.

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:27.219
Help me.

01:05:27.302 --> 01:05:29.596
Please, help me!

01:06:12.806 --> 01:06:17.686
Without you, I wouldn't know
how to survive this ordeal.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.108
In moments like these, it's
difficult to find the right words...

01:06:23.901 --> 01:06:26.820
...but when this is all over, Katia...

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:32.201
Thank you Andreï,
thank you very much.

01:06:34.203 --> 01:06:37.414
Forgive me, but it was threatening
to set the whole place on fire.

01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:38.790
Strange...

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.418
Who knows what's behind there?

01:06:41.919 --> 01:06:42.920
Doctor!

01:06:43.295 --> 01:06:46.381
When Ivan was putting out a
fire that started in the hanging,

01:06:46.507 --> 01:06:49.092
he ripped through this canvas.
Look!

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:50.511
Be careful.

01:06:57.684 --> 01:06:59.603
It's completely dark here.

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:14.910
A secret passage!

01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:17.496
Then my father was not delirious.

01:07:18.497 --> 01:07:19.581
His last words were:

01:07:20.582 --> 01:07:23.210
"The silver griffin...
the man in the portrait..."

01:07:23.585 --> 01:07:28.215
And this is where I found the dogs with
their throats sliced after Kruvajan disappeared .

01:07:28.507 --> 01:07:29.716
Let's go.

01:07:33.804 --> 01:07:37.683
Stand guard here, Ivan, and
make sure the door doesn't close.

01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:39.101
Yes, sir.

01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:53.991
It's the same face as the portrait in the salon.

01:07:54.783 --> 01:07:56.201
It's the witch!

01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:58.287
How did you know about her?

01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:03.500
I saw her when Doctor Kruvajan
and I visited the crypt.

01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:05.711
Hold this!

01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:08.189
Two days ago, the sarcophagus
was untouched, and the witch...

01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:09.983
She looks as if she has just died.

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:11.401
Look!

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:13.904
She is breathing!

01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:18.200
What a terrifying phenomenon!
I'm going to fetch the priest!

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:21.787
Return to the castle and don't leave Katia alone.
Quick, we don't have any time to lose!

01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:24.997
Go that way, you'll get to the stables quicker.

01:09:57.406 --> 01:09:59.992
After all you have told
me, everything is clear.

01:10:00.617 --> 01:10:03.662
We are facing the unleashed powers of the Devil.

01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:06.707
The ancient words on the icon explain
exactly what must be done.

01:10:07.291 --> 01:10:09.501
We must find the grave of Javutich...

01:10:09.585 --> 01:10:11.211
before sunset!

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.805
Father!

01:11:04.515 --> 01:11:06.183
The Mask of Satan.

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:08.602
Like the one I saw over the witch's face.

01:11:09.186 --> 01:11:10.896
It's just as I thought.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.981
We will find him here.

01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:18.612
Look!
A freshly dug grave!

01:11:20.197 --> 01:11:21.698
Open the coffin!

01:11:43.011 --> 01:11:44.179
Doctor Kruvajan!

01:11:44.805 --> 01:11:46.306
But last night,

01:11:47.015 --> 01:11:48.517
he was still alive.

01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:51.520
I saw him!

01:11:51.603 --> 01:11:53.814
No, he was already dead.

01:11:54.398 --> 01:11:56.483
But it's impossible, Father.

01:11:56.817 --> 01:12:00.487
He moved, he even spoke
to me, and then he ran away.

01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:05.617
Sometimes Satan, with his
great capacity for doing evil,

01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:08.203
even plays tricks with the dead.

01:12:18.297 --> 01:12:19.506
You see?

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:21.884
Here is the proof.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:27.389
Now we have to find a way
to let his soul to rest in peace.

01:12:28.682 --> 01:12:30.017
How?

01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:34.480
The inscription on the icon...

01:12:34.897 --> 01:12:37.483
...indicates the only way.

01:12:44.114 --> 01:12:48.202
The spell is broken.

01:12:48.285 --> 01:12:49.411
Poor Kruvajan.

01:12:52.789 --> 01:12:54.291
We have to act.

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.919
Quickly, now that everything is clear.

01:12:57.002 --> 01:13:01.507
The witch turned your friend
into a slave of the Devil.

01:13:01.715 --> 01:13:05.719
Dead during the day, but alive by night.

01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:09.515
So he could carry out the
malignant orders of his master.

01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:11.183
Then the Princess, too...

01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:14.186
Yes. We have no time to lose,

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:17.189
or the witch may regain her life.

01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:18.482
How?

01:13:18.816 --> 01:13:21.485
By possessing the body
of another young woman.

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:22.110
Katia!

01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:23.487
Yes, Katia.

01:13:23.821 --> 01:13:26.698
Run to the castle.
It's already late!

01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:30.285
Before the sun goes down, you
must pierce the left eye of the witch.

01:13:30.494 --> 01:13:34.790
Go now. I will do the same to the body
of Boris, which is still in the sacristy...

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:36.083
...and then I'll join you.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.508
Constantin!
Ivan!

01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:15.539
Is anyone there?

01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:21.003
Where is everyone?

01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:30.012
Help me!

01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:42.441
Where are you?

01:14:55.412 --> 01:14:57.998
Help me, Father!
Help me!

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:02.503
Don't leave me alone with all these horrors!

01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:37.996
I'm no longer your father.
My blood is no longer your blood.

01:15:38.705 --> 01:15:44.294
The spirits of evil have broken that tie between
us forever. Cursed fluids flow through your body!

01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:54.031
Constantin!
Ivan!

01:16:54.364 --> 01:16:55.365
Open up!

01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:03.499
Your vengeance is at hand, Asa.

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.418
Finally the hour of our freedom strikes.

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:19.681
Where are you?

01:19:10.584 --> 01:19:13.420
You are ignoring the fact that
you were born for this moment,

01:19:13.795 --> 01:19:18.425
and that your life has been
consecrated to me by Satan.

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:20.344
But you sensed it, didn't you?

01:19:20.427 --> 01:19:24.515
That's why my portrait fascinated

01:19:24.765 --> 01:19:26.308
and terrified you.

01:19:26.308 --> 01:19:29.770
You felt that your life and body were mine.

01:19:30.062 --> 01:19:33.315
You felt like me because you
were destined to become me.

01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:36.401
A living corpse.

01:19:37.611 --> 01:19:41.156
The love of that young man could have
saved you from this curse, you know.

01:19:41.156 --> 01:19:47.329
But I was stronger.
Now you will enjoy a beautiful new life,

01:19:47.412 --> 01:19:50.040
full of evil and hate, with me.

01:20:58.192 --> 01:20:59.902
-Constantin.
-Don't worry about me.

01:21:00.319 --> 01:21:03.614
Save Katia.
Don't lose time.

01:21:04.198 --> 01:21:07.201
Save Katia from the witch.

01:21:30.599 --> 01:21:33.769
Katia, thank God
I have arrived in time!

01:21:34.436 --> 01:21:37.147
She wanted to kill me.

01:21:37.147 --> 01:21:39.191
Do something before it's too late.

01:21:39.274 --> 01:21:42.069
I couldn't do it.
Quickly.

01:21:43.278 --> 01:21:46.073
Yes, you are right.
We must destroy her.

01:21:46.865 --> 01:21:48.200
Now I know how it can be done.

01:21:55.207 --> 01:21:58.418
Don't look, it's horrible,
but there is no other way.

01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:25.112
But... this is your cross.

01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:29.533
Katia...
How is this possible?

01:22:40.169 --> 01:22:41.170
I understand.

01:22:44.256 --> 01:22:44.756
Come...

01:22:48.302 --> 01:22:50.012
I am not your love.

01:22:50.095 --> 01:22:54.183
There she lies, devastated, lost forever.

01:22:54.224 --> 01:22:57.352
My vengeance is complete.

01:22:57.436 --> 01:23:00.439
Her entire family has been annihilated.

01:23:01.398 --> 01:23:04.985
Look at me, Andreï.
Look into my eyes,

01:23:05.944 --> 01:23:08.780
like Kruvajan did that night.

01:23:08.989 --> 01:23:11.617
and like him, lose yourself deep in my eyes.

01:23:12.534 --> 01:23:16.288
You too will feel the immense joy of hating.

01:23:16.413 --> 01:23:17.706
Look at me.

01:23:22.753 --> 01:23:24.588
She, she is the witch.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.466
Don't be deceived by her face.
Look at her body.

01:23:27.466 --> 01:23:30.052
She is transforming herself into Katia

01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:31.512
by draining her life's blood.

01:23:31.512 --> 01:23:32.513
Quemadla!

01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:19.393
<i>Two centuries ago,
a storm prevented the flames</i>

01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:22.354
<i>from destroying the wicked soul of the witch.</i>

01:24:22.813 --> 01:24:26.066
<i>Today, her innocent victims</i>

01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:31.363
<i>have broken the spell.</i>

01:24:36.952 --> 01:24:38.036
Why...

01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:40.873
Why was she taken away from me, Father?

01:24:45.043 --> 01:24:48.172
Katia's beauty is dying with her.

01:24:53.343 --> 01:24:56.096
My life has finally come to an end.

01:24:58.515 --> 01:25:00.476
How can I ever forget?

01:25:01.268 --> 01:25:03.228
How can I resign myself?

01:25:04.313 --> 01:25:06.482
I will never find peace again.

01:25:09.818 --> 01:25:12.571
Look at her young body, destroyed.
