WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.705
Ostensibly on Legion...

00:04.738 --> 00:08.076
NARRATOR: A delusion starts
like any other idea, as an egg.

00:08.109 --> 00:12.012
From the shell, you'd never
know anything was wrong.

00:12.046 --> 00:15.383
It's what's inside
that matters.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.221
You're still working for him.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.722
-The Shadow King.
-Okay,

00:21.755 --> 00:24.192
I'm not not working for him.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.993
How are you real?

00:29.097 --> 00:30.664
Whose body is that?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.366
LENNY: I'm not sure
Farouk found his body.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.003
I think he found mine.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.139
:
No, no, no, no.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.315
*

01:11.572 --> 01:16.110
NARRATOR: Moral panic is defined
as "public anxiety or alarm

01:16.144 --> 01:18.112
"in response
to a perceived threat

01:18.146 --> 01:20.648
to the moral standards
of society."

01:25.586 --> 01:28.489
The road to moral panic

01:28.522 --> 01:32.726
has several stops.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.464
The first is concern.

01:40.434 --> 01:45.439
This concern, limited at first,

01:45.473 --> 01:48.342
spreads from person
to person...

01:54.848 --> 01:57.351
...amplified
by cultural forces...

02:02.490 --> 02:06.160
...until rational concern

02:06.194 --> 02:09.163
becomes irrational fear.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.301
People come to believe

02:13.334 --> 02:15.169
something terrible
is happening.

02:15.203 --> 02:18.506
Something they cannot see.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.874
That they can't control.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.184
It has come for others.

02:30.218 --> 02:33.120
It will come for them.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.288
:
Witch!

02:34.322 --> 02:36.324
Get her!

02:39.860 --> 02:43.297
NARRATOR: Whether or not
the threat is real,

02:43.331 --> 02:46.734
the response certainly is.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.771
And it is often excessive.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.392
Ask yourself:

03:11.425 --> 03:15.563
what's more terrifying,

03:15.596 --> 03:19.767
fear, or the frightened?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.000
DAVID :
Amahl Farouk,

05:00.033 --> 05:05.773
tapeworm, parasite, shit beetle.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.642
I'm calling you out.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.678
*

05:32.065 --> 05:34.402
You're upset.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.377
Use your words.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.381
Amy.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.982
Oh, please.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.752
She put you in l'asile,
like a crazy person.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.654
I was sick.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.658
You were a joke, something
to laugh at with her friends.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.059
David the dancing bear.

06:00.794 --> 06:05.365
She was trying to help me,
and you killed her.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.338
Did she?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.906
Help?

06:12.940 --> 06:18.679
Or did you wish horrible things
for dear sister Amy?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.649
Terrible things.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.089
No secrets.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.793
Those were just thoughts.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.061
They were...

06:35.896 --> 06:37.865
You hated her.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.368
You wished her dead
for calling you insane.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.371
Her foot always on your back,
stopping you from being

06:44.404 --> 06:47.641
who you are, what you could be.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.712
And now, it's time
for them to pay.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.414
Who?

06:54.448 --> 06:56.416
Everyone.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.952
Remove your mask.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.054
Show them your face.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.123
You could be beautiful.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.794
I'm not like you.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.896
I don't hide behind masks.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.674
I'm tired of the boo-hoo.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.610
Do what you want.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.112
Take what you want.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.115
Gods make rules.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.984
They don't follow them.

07:33.621 --> 07:37.090
I'm done.

07:37.124 --> 07:42.796
You and me, we're not friends.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.767
I'm not helping you anymore.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.771
I'm gonna find your body,
and then I'm gonna burn it.

07:50.804 --> 07:55.609
And if you're lucky,
that's all I'm gonna do to it.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.011
You feel me?

08:00.881 --> 08:03.784
Okay.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.955
It seems I was wrong.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.792
You're not ready
to sit with big boys.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.795
Back to the kiddie table.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.830
I will miss you, my friend.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.132
But I'm sure we will
see each other again,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.968
when I'm back in my body.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.070
My temple.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.473
On your mark,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.909
get set...

08:31.511 --> 08:32.980
...go.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.207
DAVID:
Amy.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.816
Amy.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.686
It's not true.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.688
What he said.

09:14.722 --> 09:18.558
I didn't want this.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.594
I didn't...

09:25.298 --> 09:27.267
:
I'm sorry.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.778
DAVID:
Don't laugh at me.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.982
Stop it.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.919
Stop it!

09:45.953 --> 09:47.921
Now!

10:10.143 --> 10:11.779
DAVID 1:
Stop it. We can't torture him.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.280
DAVID 2:
Why not?

10:13.313 --> 10:15.282
DAVID 1:
Because first, it's horrible,

10:15.315 --> 10:17.685
and second, he's just a mind.
Does he even feel pain?

10:17.718 --> 10:19.586
SYD:
Do you want to talk about it?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.755
Huh?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.791
Amy?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.762
No.

10:28.796 --> 10:32.933
He wants you distracted,
emotional.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.101
Farouk.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.104
I know.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.638
You can't let him.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.007
I know.

11:00.694 --> 11:04.297
What does she say about it?

11:04.331 --> 11:07.067
Me, in the future.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.974
I don't know,
we haven't talked about it.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.709
Maybe you should.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.111
Talk to her.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.783
If you're not gonna talk to me.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.988
That wouldn't bother you?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.990
What?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.725
If you talk to me?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.727
In the future

11:33.761 --> 11:36.063
Oh, no reason. Just...

11:36.096 --> 11:40.400
Well, I wouldn't
want you to be jealous.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.936
Of myself?

11:42.970 --> 11:46.373
Why would I...

11:46.406 --> 11:48.075
David, why would I be
jealous of myself?

11:48.108 --> 11:50.077
No, no reason. It's...

11:50.110 --> 11:51.879
I

11:51.912 --> 11:55.382
Y-You're you and she's also you,

11:55.415 --> 11:57.417
and I'm not...

11:57.450 --> 12:00.353
It's not like
there's a handbook.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.990
Are you physical with her?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.392
No.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.363
David?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.033
See? You are jealous.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.935
I'm not.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.139
I just...

12:21.274 --> 12:23.944
You're right, it's weird.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.247
So let's...

12:27.280 --> 12:29.716
why don't we make some...

12:29.749 --> 12:31.418
ground rules?

12:35.288 --> 12:36.857
Okay.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.829
You can talk to her.

12:41.862 --> 12:45.132
And if she needs a hug
or something...

12:47.134 --> 12:50.137
I know it
doesn't make sense, but...

12:50.170 --> 12:52.472
It's-it's how you feel.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.945
Hey.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.213
I love you.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.095
Are you gonna say it, too?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.796
:
Shut up.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.304
I love you.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.244
*

14:24.197 --> 14:26.599
David?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.915
-How...
-You think he is

14:41.949 --> 14:45.118
the only one
who can outsmart the universe?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.553
Our David?

14:56.163 --> 14:58.898
:
He told you.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.468
He-- he won't help.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.137
You think I need his help?

15:07.074 --> 15:09.876
He kills you.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.045
In my timeline,
the race ends and you lose.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.380
So, yes...

15:13.413 --> 15:15.182
I think you need him.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.621
*

15:21.654 --> 15:25.558
Do you play craps?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.995
Roll the bones?

15:29.196 --> 15:31.398
Dice.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.467
A game of chance.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.437
ProbabilitÃ©.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.973
But it can be rigged.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.975
You mean you can cheat?

15:42.009 --> 15:43.576
Escheat.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.345
That's a legal term...

15:45.378 --> 15:47.981
which means: under the law,

15:48.015 --> 15:50.250
the property of an individual

15:50.283 --> 15:53.020
reverts to the state

15:53.053 --> 15:57.624
if the individual dies
without an heir.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.426
I don't understand.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.161
All I'm saying is...

16:01.194 --> 16:03.030
who writes the law?

16:03.063 --> 16:04.998
The state.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.034
So you see...

16:07.067 --> 16:10.303
the game is rigged.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.172
And, baby...

16:12.205 --> 16:15.108
I am the state.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.577
So even when I lose...

16:19.512 --> 16:21.614
...I win.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.122
You can't hurt me here.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.158
You know that, right?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.061
Are you sure?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.467
But no, mon amour.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.336
Why would I hurt you?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.306
We are allies.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.708
We both want the same thing--

16:48.741 --> 16:51.044
for me to live.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.480
Now, I know why this

16:53.513 --> 16:56.316
is what I want.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.051
The question is:

16:58.085 --> 17:01.654
why is this what you want?

17:01.688 --> 17:04.557
We need you.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.527
We?

17:12.199 --> 17:14.301
I need you.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.106
To stop the world from ending.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.378
And who will end the world?

17:28.115 --> 17:31.050
Tiny humans with their bombs?

17:31.084 --> 17:33.453
Or World War III?

17:37.224 --> 17:38.558
No.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.761
*

17:55.742 --> 17:57.610
No.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.421
Stop it.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.496
For centuries...

18:16.529 --> 18:19.666
everyone said, "Amahl Farouk

18:19.699 --> 18:21.568
is the villain."

18:21.601 --> 18:23.670
Year after year,

18:23.703 --> 18:26.739
they came-- the heroes...

18:26.773 --> 18:31.077
with their blue eyes
and their white skin...

18:31.110 --> 18:32.779
to kill me.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.685
They thought by killing me

18:38.718 --> 18:41.788
they will save the world.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.791
And now you're telling me

18:44.824 --> 18:48.628
that the opposite is true.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.463
That...

18:50.497 --> 18:52.799
the villain...

18:52.832 --> 18:55.768
is the hero...

18:55.802 --> 18:58.771
and the hero...

18:58.805 --> 19:01.341
is the villain?

19:06.813 --> 19:09.316
Oxymoron.

19:11.184 --> 19:14.354
Maybe we're all
vill-villains.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.356
All?

19:16.389 --> 19:18.358
If you're the Earth,

19:18.391 --> 19:21.494
the birds...

19:21.528 --> 19:23.330
peace.

19:27.334 --> 19:31.137
"When two tribes go to war...

19:31.170 --> 19:34.507
a point is all you can score."

19:35.675 --> 19:38.678
Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.751
If David doesn't help me...

19:47.287 --> 19:49.188
...you will.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.694
And together,
we'll rule the world.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.765
Save the world.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.235
From him.

20:58.257 --> 21:02.629
Isn't it weird that
we were both inside David?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.531
Mentally, I mean.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.934
I know what you're doing.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.636
What?

21:09.669 --> 21:12.639
Shaving my armpits?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.741
You're not Lenny.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.444
And you're not Amy.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.347
You're the song they play
outside a hostage crisis

21:20.380 --> 21:24.417
to keep criminals
from thinking clearly.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.355
I hear what you're saying.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.490
And I agree--

21:30.523 --> 21:32.692
we're gonna be best friends.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.894
It's not gonna work.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.532
None of your crazy shit.

21:39.566 --> 21:43.770
Whatever Farouk
told you to do...

21:43.803 --> 21:46.272
your secret plan...

21:46.305 --> 21:48.708
it's just noise.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.914
He raped me.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.385
Farouk.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.453
Over and over again.

22:00.487 --> 22:04.290
Kept me in the basement
of his mind.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.359
Like one of those Amish girls

22:06.393 --> 22:09.028
snatched from the side
of the road.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.402
But...

22:15.435 --> 22:16.969
you know, whatever.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.473
Um, bros before hos, right?

22:20.507 --> 22:23.376
:
Girl power. I guess.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.749
(Lenny snapping fingers
repeatedly)

22:54.907 --> 22:57.544
(distorted,
whispering voices continue)

23:02.782 --> 23:04.417
Hello?

23:04.451 --> 23:08.421
:
Hello Hello

24:01.708 --> 24:03.943
What do you want?

24:15.187 --> 24:17.624
David!

24:17.657 --> 24:21.594
Aah!

24:21.628 --> 24:24.597
Help! Aah!

24:24.631 --> 24:26.633

24:49.488 --> 24:51.824
(distorted,
indistinct whispering)

25:04.503 --> 25:06.839
(distorted,
indistinct whispering)

25:11.010 --> 25:12.812
* Dime si tu sabes

25:12.845 --> 25:14.814
* Si has visto mi mujer

25:14.847 --> 25:16.649
* Â¿Has visto mi mujer? *

25:16.683 --> 25:18.818
* Por la calle y allÃ¡

25:18.851 --> 25:20.653
* Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡ mi mujer? *

25:20.687 --> 25:23.756
(distorted,

25:23.790 --> 25:26.492

25:27.794 --> 25:29.996
(distorted,
indistinct whispering)

25:30.029 --> 25:31.998
* En el club

25:32.031 --> 25:34.166
* En la disco

25:34.200 --> 25:36.168
* Â¿Has visto mi mujer? *

25:36.202 --> 25:39.538
(distorted,
indistinct whispering)

25:42.108 --> 25:44.110
(distorted,
indistinct whispering)

25:56.889 --> 25:58.958
* Oye, dime si tu sabes

25:58.991 --> 26:00.727
* Si me has visto mi mujer

26:00.760 --> 26:02.929
* Pelo cotro, en la orilla

26:02.962 --> 26:04.964
* Un clavodil

26:04.997 --> 26:06.933
* Oye tu me hablas

26:06.966 --> 26:08.868
* Me hablas de sexo,
de amor *

26:08.901 --> 26:12.571
* Que ninguno,
no sabe comprender... *

26:22.949 --> 26:25.284
*

26:42.601 --> 26:46.005
*

26:49.041 --> 26:50.142
*

27:10.730 --> 27:13.766
PTONOMY: I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.601
Am I losing my mind?

27:15.634 --> 27:16.936
Admiral Fukyama. He's a...

27:16.969 --> 27:18.604
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.039
:
He sees and hears everything.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.640
It's not safe here.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.177
How long have you known?

27:25.211 --> 27:29.148
Long enough. But it is not safe,
not anymore.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.006
*

28:12.291 --> 28:14.293
*

29:00.406 --> 29:03.709
DAVID:
Did you know?

29:03.742 --> 29:05.744
:
I'm sorry. Stay focused.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.083
She was my sister.

29:13.419 --> 29:17.056
I'm s-sorry. I'm sorry.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.858
You have to stay focused.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.229
On what?

29:23.262 --> 29:25.965
Preventing some
maybe apocalypse?

29:25.998 --> 29:29.001
He killed her.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.303
Don't you understand?
He mutilated her

29:31.337 --> 29:33.806
and turned her into...

29:33.840 --> 29:36.742
And how do we know
Farouk can stop-stop it

29:36.775 --> 29:38.010
if he does get his body back?

29:38.044 --> 29:40.779
We don't.

29:40.813 --> 29:43.215
But I know we lose without him.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.856
You're not Syd.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.960
Not my Syd.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.804
I want to be.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.480
Don't.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.451
Okay.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.987
I understand.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.956
I can't.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.925
I promised.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.364
You should go

30:32.398 --> 30:33.966
if you don't want to help.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.301
-I do. I just...
-No, no.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.403
I understand.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.139
It's too much.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.075
I'm asking too much.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.077
Go.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.549
I'll be okay.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.152
The w-world.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.122
Just... live.

30:58.124 --> 31:01.060
Make good choices.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.329
Maybe things will
turn out different.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.331
Syd, I just...

31:05.364 --> 31:08.334
It just feels wrong,
helping him.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.337
I know.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.872
I shouldn't have asked.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.553
I'll miss you.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.399
Could we say good

31:50.409 --> 31:53.045
SYD:
Sometimes in a dream

31:53.079 --> 31:57.416
you remember you've had
this dream before.

32:02.921 --> 32:07.393
But that memory
is just part of the dream...

32:07.426 --> 32:12.131
the dream memory of a dream.

32:14.433 --> 32:19.305
When in truth, it's all really
happening for the first time...

32:19.338 --> 32:22.641
again.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.584
-Encoding perceptions.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.687
Enter resting state.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.216
-Shh.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.484
PTONOMY:
Syd.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.495
What is happening to me?

33:24.170 --> 33:25.337
All I have are rumors, whispers.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.672
People go
to Admiral Fukyama's pedestal

33:26.705 --> 33:28.540
-and they don't come back.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.309
He eats them.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.044
VOICE:
Symptom alert. Fixating despair.

33:32.078 --> 33:35.314
-VOICE 2: Symptom alert...
-That's not gonna happen to us.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.150
:
Symptom alert...

33:38.184 --> 33:40.086
-Symptom alert...
-Symptom alert...

33:45.023 --> 33:47.193
Fear of terrible things.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.227
Kill or be killed.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.661
-Doubt.
-Never. Dominate.

33:49.695 --> 33:50.662
-PTONOMY: Panic.
-SYD: Angry now.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.663
-CLARK: Terrified.
-SYD: Everything.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.399
-Paralyzed.
-Woman up.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.701
-Destroy.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.098

34:48.420 --> 34:51.223
Move.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.559
Analyzing.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.793
Pupils dilated.

34:54.826 --> 34:58.564
Heart rate's elevated.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.731
Physical conflict likely.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.234
Chance of victory?

35:02.268 --> 35:04.403
VERMILLION 3:
Sixty-eight percent.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.273
Cocky bitches.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.374
VERMILLION:
Regenerating.

35:42.408 --> 35:44.176
-Regenerating.
-Regenerating.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.344
Regenerating.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.514

No more hiding.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.495

Show us.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.531
Now.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.319

37:12.264 --> 37:14.199
What are you waiting for?
Kill it!

37:14.232 --> 37:15.233
No!

37:19.438 --> 37:20.572
What are you doing?

37:22.308 --> 37:24.610
-Traitors.
-Working in service of
the Shadow King.

37:24.643 --> 37:28.680
No, it's... something else.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.614
What is it?

38:05.517 --> 38:07.285
Insanity.

38:40.852 --> 38:45.323
-Organism unknown.
-Institute containment
protocols.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.875
Oh, crap.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.582
That's a bad idea.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.827
Stay here.

40:01.467 --> 40:03.469
He's dying.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.971
We can save his mind.

40:06.004 --> 40:09.641
Take him to the mainframe.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.952
*

41:17.042 --> 41:18.944
Hey!

41:20.979 --> 41:24.149
You made my friends sick.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.487
Yeah, hey.

41:29.521 --> 41:30.856
Hi, hi.

41:30.889 --> 41:34.025
Can you understand me?

41:34.059 --> 41:37.195
You picked a really shitty time
to attack us.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.130
I'm not saying it's your fault.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.832
I mean, it is, but...

41:40.866 --> 41:43.535
the timing, it's-it's not good.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.470
I'm dealing with a lot here.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.905
With the Shadow King.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.640
And, well, this...

41:48.674 --> 41:51.810
this isn't helping. So...

41:53.779 --> 41:54.880
I was hoping you could

41:54.913 --> 41:57.148
appreciate my situation

41:57.182 --> 42:00.218
and maybe, I don't know,

42:00.251 --> 42:03.221
be on your way.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.824
Go back to where you came fro--

42:05.857 --> 42:07.158
Otherwise, I have to kill you.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.227
Are you,
are you understanding this?

42:11.529 --> 42:13.832
Guess not.

42:48.099 --> 42:51.903
Remember,
I was gonna let you go.

43:09.187 --> 43:10.956
*

43:44.790 --> 43:47.325
NARRATOR:
So what have we learned?

43:47.358 --> 43:50.929
That a delusion is an idea.

43:50.962 --> 43:54.632
That an idea can be contagious.

43:54.666 --> 43:58.636
That human beings are
pattern-seeking animals.

43:58.670 --> 44:03.141
By which, I mean we prefer
ideas that fit a pattern.

44:03.174 --> 44:07.012
In other words,
we don't believe what we see.

44:07.045 --> 44:11.116
We see what we believe.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.618
And when we are stressed

44:13.651 --> 44:16.121
or our beliefs are challenged--

44:16.154 --> 44:18.223
when we feel threatened--

44:18.256 --> 44:23.628
the ideas we have
can become irrational,

44:23.661 --> 44:25.964
one delusion
leading to another,

44:25.997 --> 44:27.866
and another,

44:27.899 --> 44:32.904
as the human mind struggles
to maintain its identity.

44:32.938 --> 44:35.974
And when this occurs,

44:36.007 --> 44:38.076
what starts as an egg

44:38.109 --> 44:42.413
can become a monster.
