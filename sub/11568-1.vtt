-God.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.579
Pardon me?

00:13.581 --> 00:15.381
It was a demon.
He was on top of our house.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.149
-A demon?
-Yeah.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.784
And then God
came down from heaven

00:18.786 --> 00:20.319
and struck him with lightning.

-God?
-Why the (BEEP)
am I telling you this?

00:22.656 --> 00:25.491
Didn't you watch the
last episode of season two?

00:25.493 --> 00:28.260
That wasn't the last episode.
We went to that farm.

-No!
-No.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.810
So, where are we going?
A hotel?

00:44.812 --> 00:48.247
No. We can't go to a hotel.
My wallet was in the house.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.582
Then where
are we going to stay?

00:50.584 --> 00:51.850
I'll call my agent.

-Yeah, my agent's

I was a big (BEEP) dork, too.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.871
Once again,
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Neil Patrick Harris.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.373
That's really my bad.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.441
And I'm sorry I made you
explain it so many times.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.110
Truly, I am. I mean,
if I had just slowed down
for a second,

09:05.112 --> 09:06.745
I would have thought,
"Different last name,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.079
"different middle name,
white not black."

09:08.081 --> 09:10.148
And you're not
even a cosmetologist.

09:11.183 --> 09:12.551
Not at all.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.895

09:23.897 --> 09:25.864
Deezy, what are you
doing here?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.599
What are you doing here?

09:27.601 --> 09:28.767
-I thought you guys
were gonna stay with me.
-PIGEON: What happened?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.635
Well, we were

09:30.637 --> 09:32.637
but when we saw your place,

09:32.639 --> 09:35.373
we thought we could do better,
but we can't.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.042
So can we stay with you again?

09:37.044 --> 09:39.210
Of course, Mike.
My door is always open.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.013
Really? Is that why
you have no furniture?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.848
We'll follow you
back to your place.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.551
This is gonna be
so great, Furly.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.053
Having all those
people at our place.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.221
Conversation flowing,
socializing...

09:50.223 --> 09:52.791
Maybe we'll finally have
that game night
we've been talking about.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.593
Whoo! This is gonna be good.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.795
(BREATH TREMBLING)
Finally get me over
this, um...

09:56.797 --> 09:58.396
This little depression
I've been...

09:58.398 --> 09:59.731
I've been battling.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.536
Dad, wait,
isn't this your wallet?

10:04.538 --> 10:06.371
Oh (BEEP), we had it
the whole time.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.240
(BEEP) it. Let's go
to the Four Seasons.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.376
I can feel the
fog lifting already.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.092
Hey, I bet you were surprised
to find out

10:27.094 --> 10:29.461
that my brother
was Neil deGrasse Tyson.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.831
Yeah, but he's not the only
famous Tyson in our family.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.299
No, he isn't.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.868
By the way, Cicely Tyson,
award-winning actress,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.403
my great-great-aunt.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.740
Oh, Tyson Beckford,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.508
the Beau Brummell of his time.

10:43.510 --> 10:47.812
Handsome, debonair, didactyl.
My third cousin.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.081
And this is my tallest cousin.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.051
This is, um, Tyson Chandler.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.853
He's seven foot.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.389
And this is my great-great...
Oh, my God,

10:57.391 --> 11:00.558
my great-great-great-
great-grandfather,

11:00.560 --> 11:02.694
