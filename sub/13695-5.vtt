00:50.248 --> 00:54.127
-Are you all right, Jess?
-I see the boys got
their toys, then.

00:54.210 --> 00:55.754
Well, we thought we'd
better test them out

00:55.837 --> 00:57.422
before we let them
loose on the general public.

00:57.505 --> 01:01.468
Noisy, stupid and dangerous.
And that's just
people who ride them.

01:03.803 --> 01:06.264
Do all your staff speak
to you like that?

01:06.348 --> 01:07.932
We're informal.

01:08.016 --> 01:11.728
Oh, and my blind granny
drives better than that!

01:13.313 --> 01:14.564
So I see.

01:16.608 --> 01:17.608
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:53.019 --> 01:56.398
So, what are you going to do,
now you're no longer
the man from the ministry?

01:56.481 --> 01:59.775
I was going stale behind
a desk. I need a change,
a new challenge.

01:59.859 --> 02:01.236
What, in Glenbogle?

02:01.319 --> 02:03.863
I'm sure I can find something
to distract me.

02:05.657 --> 02:07.617
Look, look!

02:07.701 --> 02:10.453
There he is. Back left.

02:11.621 --> 02:12.789
The one holding a pint glass?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.833
No, that's Princess
Grace of Monaco.

02:14.916 --> 02:16.126
Next to her. There.

02:17.419 --> 02:19.004
It's a bit out of focus.

02:19.087 --> 02:21.881
Well, he'd probably had
a few, but that's definitely
him all right.

02:21.965 --> 02:25.635
Wee Jackie McIntyre.

02:25.719 --> 02:30.098
The finest mechanic
the Gorbals ever produced.
Oh...

02:30.181 --> 02:33.101
We raised hell,
out-drank the Devil

02:33.184 --> 02:36.354
and sent him scurrying back
to the fiery depths.

02:36.438 --> 02:38.857
-Oh, aye?
-Yes.

02:38.940 --> 02:42.902
And now wee Jackie McIntyre

02:42.986 --> 02:45.655

02:45.739 --> 02:48.617
Who is this creature,
this siren,

02:48.700 --> 02:51.786
who has tamed
the raging beast?

02:51.870 --> 02:53.413
I thought you said
her name was Isla?

02:53.496 --> 02:56.583
Huh? Oh, Rhetorical,
my dear boy. Rhetorical.

02:56.666 --> 02:58.376

-Come on!

03:02.130 --> 03:04.799
We have a stag in our midst.

03:04.883 --> 03:06.176
You've missed a bit.

03:13.058 --> 03:15.852
Wee Jackie McIntyre!

Donald Ulysses MacDonald!

03:18.396 --> 03:19.397
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:21.858 --> 03:24.819
Well, it's a nice wee place
you've got here.

03:24.903 --> 03:28.114
But then, you always were
the fancy Dan.

03:28.198 --> 03:30.074
It's a cross I have to bear.

03:30.158 --> 03:34.371
Where's that
greasy little monkey
that I knew and loved, eh?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.585
Where are the others?

03:40.669 --> 03:41.920
Ah.

03:42.003 --> 03:43.505
Well,

03:43.588 --> 03:45.840
thereby hangs a wee tale.

03:45.924 --> 03:47.634
-Oh?
-Aye.

03:59.938 --> 04:02.983
You know, when I said yes
to a second date,
I was thinking dinner.

04:03.066 --> 04:05.694
-Too keen?
-Just a smidgen.

04:05.777 --> 04:06.987
No chance of breakfast, then?

04:08.822 --> 04:09.948
None whatsoever.

04:16.370 --> 04:17.831
(DOOR CLOSES)

04:24.004 --> 04:25.255

04:26.047 --> 04:27.549
Business.

04:27.631 --> 04:29.884
100% organic.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.512
Should go down
a storm at the market.

04:32.595 --> 04:35.223
I can see it now.
Isobel Anderson, Burger Queen.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.186
Strictly a means to an end.

04:40.270 --> 04:42.314
The tractor
needs a new clutch.

04:42.397 --> 04:45.358
Can't you just
say pretty please
to the bank manager?

04:45.442 --> 04:47.402
Oh, no.

04:47.485 --> 04:50.697
No, this place
has to pay its way.

04:50.780 --> 04:54.534
A real farm, not a hobby
or a weekend indulgence.

04:54.616 --> 04:58.580
Alex, about last night...
It was just a date.

04:58.663 --> 05:02.125
I mean, it was fun,
but it was just a date.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.961
I don't want anything else,
not at the moment.

05:05.044 --> 05:06.963
Anyway, it's not as if
you're sticking around.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.969
Grant. Grant McIntosh.

05:13.053 --> 05:15.221
Dead.

05:15.305 --> 05:18.642
His stair lift gave up
the ghost halfway up.

05:18.725 --> 05:20.769
They found him
three weeks later.

05:24.189 --> 05:27.567
Big Donny,
always had a fag on the go.

05:27.651 --> 05:29.361
He wouldn't quit.

05:29.444 --> 05:31.821
Reckoned you were as likely
to get hit by a bus.

05:31.905 --> 05:32.906
That's the one.

05:33.657 --> 05:35.408
-How is he?
-Dead.

05:37.077 --> 05:39.329
Jumped the wee red man
on Sauchiehall Street.

05:39.412 --> 05:40.747
Hit by a bus?

05:42.290 --> 05:44.751
At least he had the
satisfaction of being right.

05:47.671 --> 05:50.256
So you're saying
we're the only ones left?

05:50.340 --> 05:53.843
That's about the size of it.

05:53.927 --> 05:57.179
Then we owe it to them
to do this properly.
No quarter given.

05:58.056 --> 06:01.101
We drink, we carouse,

06:01.184 --> 06:07.983
we take life
by the scruff of the neck
and shake it till it rattles.

06:08.066 --> 06:13.071
(ALARM BEEPS)
Sorry. It reminds me
to take my pills.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.411
Is it me, or is hell-raising
not what it used to be?

06:29.462 --> 06:31.172
How about that one?

06:31.256 --> 06:32.257
Too brown.

06:36.303 --> 06:38.513
That's too flappy,
I don't like flaps.

06:41.224 --> 06:44.019
There you go.

06:44.102 --> 06:48.523
We seem to have
a meeting of minds,
but I think you saw it first.

No, no, you...
Please, I insist.

Well, thank you!

every man for himself.

07:01.119 --> 07:03.371
-What do you think?
-Very nice.

07:03.455 --> 07:04.789
It's got no flaps.

07:04.873 --> 07:07.083
You know, I hate the ones
with flaps everywhere.

07:08.793 --> 07:11.880
Well, I'd better pay for it
before you change your mind.

07:13.465 --> 07:14.466
(CHUCKLES)

07:17.177 --> 07:19.054
She's right about those flaps.

07:36.863 --> 07:40.241
Didn't your mother warn
you about giving
lifts to strange men?

07:40.325 --> 07:42.786
Don't worry, I've got
a black belt in screaming.

07:42.869 --> 07:44.245
You might need it.

07:44.329 --> 07:47.290
Worried I might succumb
to your friend's
dashing charms?

07:47.374 --> 07:49.250
Well, you wouldn't
be the first.

07:52.295 --> 07:54.923
Anyway, it's none
of my business.

07:55.005 --> 07:57.884
No, it's none
of your business.

07:57.968 --> 08:00.136
Talking of which, have you
thought about my offer?

08:01.680 --> 08:03.515
Yeah.

08:03.598 --> 08:05.517
Another 12 acres
is a lot of work.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.353
And enough for another
ten head of cattle.

08:08.436 --> 08:11.481
If I'm going to make it pay,
I've got to think bigger.

08:11.564 --> 08:15.652
Now, why do I get
the impression you've
already made your mind up?

08:24.494 --> 08:26.037
Now, then...

08:28.623 --> 08:29.708
What about a real drink?

Of course, you realise
you're making
a dreadful mistake.

08:45.473 --> 08:49.853
In my experience, marriage
entails certain sacrifices.

08:49.936 --> 08:53.857
Usually human, often bloody.

08:53.939 --> 08:55.899
Ah, but when you're in love...

Only makes it worse.

up to, MacDonald.

pops, a couple of laughs,

09:10.081 --> 09:12.083
and a natter about
the old days.

You know, I might be able
to help you there.

You seemed churlish to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

Which reminds me, Jess.
Why do I get the feeling
she's walking all over you?

09:38.360 --> 09:41.780
The fact that she's got
an attitude has nothing to do
with the way I run the estate.

09:41.863 --> 09:43.490
It's got everything
to do with it.

09:43.573 --> 09:45.700
You want to feel like
the laird, you'd better
start acting like one.

09:47.285 --> 09:49.746
Jess sees you
mucking in every day,
and she thinks,

09:49.829 --> 09:52.248
"Ah, well. Leave it to Paul."

09:52.332 --> 09:54.292
So what? You think she
should call me sir?

09:54.376 --> 09:56.169
She should show you
the respect you deserve.

09:57.253 --> 09:58.922
Okay, I'm listening.

09:59.005 --> 10:00.674
Let me take over as factor.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.677
You leave all the day-to-day
running to me.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.096
That way you're free to
concentrate on being
the laird.

10:06.179 --> 10:09.516
Yeah, there's just
one small problem.
We can't afford it.

10:09.599 --> 10:12.227
A more efficient
estate means more money
in all our pockets.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.853
Yeah, in theory.

of his former self.

of the influence
of that old she-devil, Eve.

Maybe you should try it.

ability to stand in the way of
a little personal expression.

-Jess.

a crash course?

13:46.483 --> 13:48.526
I'm afraid
our continuing grants

an appropriate
arboreal balance.

Hold on. You're saying we've
got the wrong type of trees?

13:55.283 --> 13:59.162
You're currently falling short
by five hectares.

13:59.245 --> 14:04.501

means we shall have to reduce

14:30.860 --> 14:32.362
Well, then, you can show me.

14:38.368 --> 14:41.371
I'm sure we never
received anything from you.

some of the wrong trees?

received a letter,

telling her it's the first
I've heard of it.

to deal with it about,
oh, three months ago?

out between you.

I consider trees important.

I know how to get
the best out of people.

asked you for anything,

you to consider any request
from Alex as coming from me.

16:20.387 --> 16:23.014
Okay? Any questions?

to be doing from now on?

You can't feed
them with grain,
you can't rear them in cages.

17:07.684 --> 17:09.310
They're just here,

is help them the best I can.

go as they please.

not interested.

and they thought
it was one of my lot.

seems to have spilt
something on it.

something to say about that?

off the estate without Paul.

willing to take.

is involved? Look,

know won't hurt, surely?

29:51.906 --> 29:54.409
-What's happening?
-Show's over.

30:01.082 --> 30:04.210
Go! Go! Go!

30:04.294 --> 30:05.962
What are you doing?

30:06.046 --> 30:08.715
-You're going the wrong way,
laddie!
-I can't help it. It's stuck!

30:08.798 --> 30:10.300
Stop! Stop!

30:16.431 --> 30:17.849
Damn.

30:20.226 --> 30:24.022
Planting here would cost you
next to nothing.

30:24.105 --> 30:28.526
Would do, only we've promised
it to Isobel Anderson,
one of our tenant farmers.

30:28.610 --> 30:33.573
Far be it from me to meddle
in estate politics, but...

30:36.201 --> 30:40.914
It's called farmland premium,
paid-for change of use.

30:40.997 --> 30:44.542
Plant this land, and you'll be
in line for a further grant.

30:47.045 --> 30:48.505
How much?

31:08.233 --> 31:10.026
Thanks. Looking for me?

31:11.194 --> 31:13.321
I can see you're busy.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.408
Dad, there's an injured stag
up by the lochan.

31:16.491 --> 31:18.618
I'm sure you're
more than capable.

31:18.702 --> 31:21.413
Um, I was hoping
you'd be able to sort it.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.627
Go on, go. I think the fish
have had enough punishment
for one day.

31:29.671 --> 31:31.339
Sorry to spoil your
life of leisure.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.216
No, you're doing us
both a favour.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.719
Like your friend?

31:35.802 --> 31:37.387
Is this what they call
regimental loyalty,

31:37.470 --> 31:39.639
or is it just
good old jobs for the boys?

31:55.739 --> 31:57.532
You've made
the right decision.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.326
Us tree people
must stick together.

31:59.409 --> 32:00.619
Absolutely.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.547
I believe these belong to you.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.729
(CHUCKLES)

32:36.696 --> 32:37.989
Golly?

32:42.118 --> 32:44.996
I was beginning to think
you'd changed your mind.

32:46.998 --> 32:48.416
What are you doing here?

32:48.500 --> 32:49.584
Oh...

32:49.668 --> 32:50.752
I got your note.

32:51.544 --> 32:53.838
-Note?
-Here.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.888
Golly?

33:25.912 --> 33:29.791
Listen, I'm sorry about this.
I...

33:29.874 --> 33:32.252
There's been a mistake.
I didn't write that.

33:33.503 --> 33:34.504
So who did?

33:38.133 --> 33:39.634
We've been set up.

33:40.468 --> 33:42.220
(MEG LAUGHS)

33:42.304 --> 33:47.309
Well, whoever it was,
they know how to pick a spot.

33:47.392 --> 33:50.895
I'm sorry that you've been
dragged all the way up here.

33:50.979 --> 33:53.356
I'll drive you back.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.318
It seems a shame
to waste all of this.

33:56.401 --> 33:58.528
I mean, seeing as someone
went to all this trouble.

33:58.611 --> 34:01.239
Trouble is the word,
all right.

34:01.323 --> 34:03.617
Perhaps they were
trying to do you a favour.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.577
What, am I supposed
to be grateful or something?

34:09.748 --> 34:10.748
I would be.

34:18.797 --> 34:20.132
Peace offering.

34:22.302 --> 34:23.887
I think I've had my fill.

34:24.638 --> 34:26.806
Come on!

34:26.889 --> 34:30.935
Callum poking his nose in
was just a setback, at worst.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.730
For you, maybe.

34:33.813 --> 34:35.649
I've got responsibilities.

34:35.732 --> 34:38.860
There's a policewoman
out there with my ring
on her finger.

34:38.943 --> 34:41.612
-For now.
-Forever, Donald.

34:42.322 --> 34:43.531
Hmm.

34:45.116 --> 34:49.245
Look at me. I'm this far off
being an old man.

34:50.246 --> 34:53.833
I need peace and I need quiet,

34:55.460 --> 34:56.835
and I need Isla.

34:58.463 --> 35:00.006
Pipe and slippers?

35:00.090 --> 35:02.968
Aye. A woman that loves me.

35:05.887 --> 35:10.350
I know you almost as well
as you know yourself,

35:10.433 --> 35:13.353
-and I know you've
never had that.
-I beg to...

35:13.436 --> 35:19.192
Oh, I know there have been
the great passions
and the fly-by-night lassies,

35:19.275 --> 35:22.487
but you've never had
what I've got with Isla.

35:23.530 --> 35:24.656
Perhaps I didn't want it.

35:26.241 --> 35:31.871
I was a racer, a risk-taker.
I couldn't settle down.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.332
You think you're living life,

35:35.541 --> 35:37.794
but from where I'm sitting,

35:37.877 --> 35:40.046
all you've ever done
is avoid it.

35:45.885 --> 35:48.680
I'm not prepared
to make that mistake.

36:00.524 --> 36:01.526
Did you find it?

36:02.944 --> 36:04.695
The stag? Yeah, I found it.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.576
So how was it?

36:11.535 --> 36:13.246
Dad!

36:13.330 --> 36:16.082
-Come on, what happened?
-Nothing happened.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.461
Apart from being humiliated
by my own daughter.

36:22.839 --> 36:26.009
The woman
is practically half my age.

36:26.092 --> 36:27.802
I was trying to help you.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.096
What was I supposed
to say to her?

36:30.180 --> 36:32.641
-Hello?
-I run my own life.

36:33.350 --> 36:34.434
Dad.

36:36.811 --> 36:41.107
Look, how do you think I feel?
I hate seeing you like this.

36:41.191 --> 36:42.275
Like what, exactly?

36:42.942 --> 36:43.943
Lonely.

36:45.737 --> 36:46.780
Dad?

37:02.963 --> 37:06.716
-What happened?
-You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.804
You know,
I thought if I worked hard,

37:10.887 --> 37:13.098
if I put in the hours,
things would come good.

37:16.726 --> 37:18.645
What are you doing here, Alex?

37:18.728 --> 37:21.064
Um, I've got some news.

37:22.565 --> 37:24.442
Paul's given me
the factor's job.

37:25.402 --> 37:26.444
Congratulations.

37:31.324 --> 37:32.659

I'll be sticking around.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.205
Sorry.

37:37.289 --> 37:40.917
It's not what you want
to hear right now, I know.

37:41.001 --> 37:43.003
No, I'm pleased.

37:43.837 --> 37:45.297
Really, I am.

37:49.843 --> 37:51.636
Could you give this
to Alex for me?

37:51.720 --> 37:52.846
I should have left it
with him earlier,

37:52.929 --> 37:55.015
but it completely
slipped my mind.

37:56.266 --> 37:58.101
I don't understand.

37:58.184 --> 38:01.730
It's just some forms for
Ms Anderson to sign,
for the farmland conversion.

38:03.023 --> 38:04.065
Right.

38:16.578 --> 38:17.621
Aye-aye.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.171
Do you know what I liked
about the army?

38:27.714 --> 38:29.799
It was all laid out for you.

38:29.883 --> 38:32.761
You got up when they told you,
you did what they told you
and you went to bed...

38:32.844 --> 38:34.262
When they told you.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.222
Yeah, I remember.

38:36.306 --> 38:39.643
It was simple.
Officers and men.

38:39.726 --> 38:42.812
The lads used to laugh
at them, you know,
people like Alex.

38:42.896 --> 38:46.650
Of course, we all knew what
we'd do if we were in charge.

38:49.527 --> 38:50.737
We were in Kosovo together.

38:52.322 --> 38:53.865
Alex was my CO.

38:57.035 --> 39:00.121
I was leading
a routine patrol.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.873
We saw a group of civilians.

39:01.957 --> 39:05.335
God knows what they
were doing there, but they
were coming under fire.

39:06.962 --> 39:09.172
I had to make a decision.

39:11.091 --> 39:13.134
So, I took the squad in.

39:14.803 --> 39:16.596
And it was a trap.

39:18.473 --> 39:21.059
As soon as we got there,
all hell broke loose.

39:22.477 --> 39:24.980
Alex had to come in
and bail me out.

39:27.148 --> 39:29.150
That's when he got hit.

39:31.486 --> 39:34.239
He was invalided out
a few months later.

39:36.283 --> 39:37.784
Because of me.

39:38.827 --> 39:39.995
I see.

39:41.496 --> 39:43.999
And now you're
the one in charge.

39:46.418 --> 39:49.587
Paul, your father
was a very eccentric man.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.633
He made mistakes.
Lots of them.

39:53.717 --> 39:56.219
He had his own way
of doing things.

39:57.345 --> 40:00.640
But somehow,
one way or the other,

40:00.724 --> 40:04.019
it all seemed to work out.

40:04.102 --> 40:07.564
I suppose he had
an instinct for the place.

40:07.647 --> 40:09.941
For the right thing to do.

40:11.359 --> 40:14.154
And what if I don't
want to take charge?

40:14.237 --> 40:17.032
Someone else will do it.

40:17.115 --> 40:20.160
This place is bigger
than all of us, son.

40:20.243 --> 40:24.706
All we can do is take
care of it the best we can.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.667
What if my best isn't
good enough, Golly?

40:29.294 --> 40:32.589
Just don't fail
for the want of trying.

40:32.672 --> 40:35.675
That wasn't your father's way,
and I'm damn sure
it isn't yours.

You should look harder.

walked out like that.

to be a date.

What you have to understand
is that, after Molly,

just to leave
all that stuff behind me.

weren't scared of anything.

going to discuss it with her.

thought you'd get the ball
rolling anyway?

No, no, it wasn't like that.

-He's alone.

Don't get me wrong,
I didn't need them to like me,

in that street was my fault.

But they still followed you.

they know they can trust you
to do the right thing.

48:24.561 --> 48:27.188
-It's the only thing.
-But it's your decision.

48:29.899 --> 48:34.154
Hey, MacDonald,
do you remember this?
How it feels?

48:34.863 --> 48:36.156
Every day.

48:36.239 --> 48:38.950
You know, I wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

48:39.034 --> 48:40.702
I couldn't have done it
without you.

48:43.955 --> 48:47.375
-May the best man win.
-He intends to.

49:03.391 --> 49:06.811
-Do I really have to do this?
-We had a deal.

49:11.232 --> 49:14.486
(BAGPIPE MUSIC STARTS)

49:17.572 --> 49:19.699
-I'm waiting.
-Patience.

49:49.771 --> 49:51.856
Go on, Donald, son!

49:59.739 --> 50:02.575
-Just one more thing.
-Hmm?

50:02.659 --> 50:06.997
What exactly is Golly
short for?

50:07.080 --> 50:08.456
(CHUCKLES)

50:08.540 --> 50:10.041
Come here.

50:16.339 --> 50:18.508
Shall I tell you a secret now?

50:18.591 --> 50:20.051
Yes, please.

51:00.175 --> 51:02.302
Is that gap supposed
to be there?

51:02.385 --> 51:03.386
DONALD: Whoa!

51:06.431 --> 51:07.724
Donald!

51:20.070 --> 51:21.154
Donald?

51:22.155 --> 51:23.239
Are you all right?

51:29.996 --> 51:30.997
(SIGHS)

51:31.957 --> 51:34.501
(DONALD LAUGHS)

51:36.419 --> 51:38.338
Donald, you'll never change.

51:43.093 --> 51:44.386
-You got it running, then?
-(ENGINE RUMBLING)

51:44.469 --> 51:46.179
Yeah, thanks to Jackie.

51:46.262 --> 51:47.889
(ENGINE STOPS)

51:47.973 --> 51:51.351
It was the least they could
do after the mess
they made of my stall.

51:55.772 --> 51:57.565
So, that's it, then.

51:57.649 --> 51:59.317
Ten years whether
I like it or not.

51:59.401 --> 52:01.319
Yeah,
sorry about the neighbours.

52:01.403 --> 52:03.613
Well, you know,
you can't have everything.

52:05.407 --> 52:06.908
Still think you
can make a go of it?

52:06.992 --> 52:10.495
Who knows? At least I know
who I can trust from now on.

52:17.419 --> 52:18.962
Paul...

52:21.798 --> 52:24.467
Can I just ask you one thing?

52:24.551 --> 52:29.264
Alex and me. You weren't just
a tiny bit jealous?

52:30.557 --> 52:32.392
Yeah, a little.

52:32.475 --> 52:34.185
He and I were very close.

52:38.398 --> 52:40.525
So, what about
your precious trees?

52:42.068 --> 52:43.737
Even lairds can't
always get what they want.

53:00.128 --> 53:02.881
(BAGPIPER PLAYING
MAIRI'S WEDDING )

53:06.426 --> 53:08.094
(CHEERS)

53:12.223 --> 53:16.102
I hardly think this
is necessary,
in the circumstances.
