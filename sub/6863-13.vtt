WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.371
You broke up with Scooter?
You were right. He's a jerk.

00:03.404 --> 00:06.507
Sometimes I think
I never should have let you go.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.442
We should go out sometime.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.112
We're renting a house!
No, we're not.
We're buying a house.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.413
It's just a few days' work,
 right?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.782
No, we're looking
at a top-to-bottomer here.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.051
We need to talk about
where we're gonna live 'cause

00:17.085 --> 00:18.452
Duke said that the remodel
is going to take two months.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.687
You thought I was
gonna propose?

00:19.720 --> 00:21.522
I told him I was fine
with waiting.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.790
So, you're not?

00:22.823 --> 00:24.425
You are the love
of my life.

00:24.458 --> 00:28.429
Do you know for sure
if I am the love of your life?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.247
(sighs)

00:48.316 --> 00:50.284
Hey, good morning.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.853
Ugh! It was for half a second.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.289
Then I opened my eyes
and remembered that I'm back

00:55.323 --> 00:56.557
in Lavon's carriage house.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.759
Lavon's rent-free
carriage house.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.729
You agreed it makes sense.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.197
And all the money we
save on the B and B,

01:04.232 --> 01:06.567
we invest in our house
and our future. Besides,

01:06.600 --> 01:10.171
you wanted to be here for
Lavon in his time of need.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.173
That was nice of me.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.707
Just, being back here
feels so lame,

01:13.741 --> 01:15.176
like moving in with your mother

01:15.209 --> 01:16.344
after you graduate
college.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.711
Hey! That happens, all right?

01:17.745 --> 01:20.314
It's not easy for
a 22-year-old to earn a living

01:20.348 --> 01:21.282
with a degree
in comparative literature.

01:22.483 --> 01:26.654
Anyway, I know something
that might distract you.

01:26.687 --> 01:27.888
Oh! Uh-uh! Nope.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.324
Come on, please? Come on.
Your birthday's in two days!
No!

01:30.358 --> 01:31.325
You really don't want a party?

01:31.359 --> 01:32.726
Well, what gave you that clue?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.728
The 47 times I vetoed it
last week?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.330
No, I told you,
every birthday...

01:36.364 --> 01:38.266
"Only brings you that much
closer to death." I know.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.601
I know.
Yes. And as a doctor,
I oppose all things

01:40.634 --> 01:42.736
that bring anyone
closer to death.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.472
Besides, all my birthdays
have been disasters.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.806
They've been less about
what I want

01:45.839 --> 01:47.741
and more about what my mother
wants for me.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.510
Think of all the things
you have to celebrate:

01:49.543 --> 01:51.379
a new house,
a newfound family,

01:51.412 --> 01:52.613
amazing boyfriend

01:52.646 --> 01:55.483
who happens to be a world-class
thrower of birthday parties.

01:55.516 --> 01:59.420
I promise you'll have
a great time. Please? Please?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.155
Please...?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.356
Oh, fine!

02:02.390 --> 02:04.292
But no trick candles
that don't blow out.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.159
Deal.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.694
Mm.
(door opens)

02:06.727 --> 02:09.297
WADE:
All right, all right,
break it up!

02:09.330 --> 02:10.497
Get a room.
(laughs)

02:10.531 --> 02:11.799
This is our room!

02:11.832 --> 02:13.801
Lavon sent us to get y'all
for breakfast.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.636
Next time, we'll knock.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.171
Oh.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.573
(door closes)
(sighs, groans)

02:19.607 --> 02:22.142
I really hope those renovations
are done fast.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.250
Oh, thank you so much
for my breakup pie!

02:29.283 --> 02:31.385
It's exactly what I need
to get on my feet.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.654
Oh, no! I totally forgot
to make you a breakup pie!

02:33.687 --> 02:35.389
No, Crickett, it's fine.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.957
I'm up to my ears in meringue.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.860
Well, let me just say
how great you look.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.195
Everyone is in awe

02:41.229 --> 02:42.796
of how you are handling this.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.966
You are a shining example
of how to conduct oneself

02:45.999 --> 02:48.202
when a relationship crumbles.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.837
(chuckles wryly):
What do you need?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.740
Could you maybe come to the
Belle meeting tomorrow?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.842
You do recall
I'm no longer a Belle?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.877
Rejoin. I'll fast-track you.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.812
Please?!

02:58.846 --> 03:00.414
Ever since
I almost bankrupted them,

03:00.448 --> 03:01.682
those ladies are out for blood.

03:01.715 --> 03:02.883
I need an ally!

03:02.916 --> 03:04.985
You need a distraction!

03:05.018 --> 03:06.587
Win-win.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.223
I'm sorry, Crickett.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.692
I'm just not in a social,
or a Belle...

03:11.725 --> 03:13.861
or a helping-out kind of place
right now.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.296
Please understand.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.564
Fine.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.631
But promise me,

03:17.665 --> 03:21.302
when you see my head rolling
through town square,

03:21.335 --> 03:23.404
you will return it to Stanley.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.473
Mm-hmm.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.610
Well, this is cozy.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.446
You know, there really aren't
enough seats for all of us.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.882
So Joel and I will just go
to the Rammer Jammer.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.618
I actually own the Rammer
Jammer, so we'll go.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.853
Nobody leaves!
I need my friends.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.855
Time of need?
And look at all this food.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.992
It i a lot of food,
even for you.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.594
I figured you'd be hungry.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.496
I cooked a lot, too,
when my husband and I separated.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.498
It's good. It's good to stay
busy when you're, you know...

03:50.531 --> 03:51.999
Lonely, sad, pathetic?

03:52.032 --> 03:55.336
Lavon, just know that time
heals all wounds...

03:55.369 --> 03:56.904
and rebound sex.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.539
And that's
my boyfriend, folks.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.374
Mm-hmm. Come here.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.510
As much as I'd like to stay
and watch my ex stick

04:02.543 --> 04:03.877
his tongue down my
newly-found cousin's throat,

04:03.911 --> 04:05.045
I have to get to work.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.915
Call me
if you need anything.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.417
Bye.
Bye.
Mwah!

04:12.686 --> 04:13.754
Okay, people,
attention.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.823
We are at DEFCON 1
for birthday planning.

04:15.856 --> 04:16.923
Zoe finally agreed

04:16.957 --> 04:18.426
to have a party!
Zoe hates birthdays.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.793
Zoe's not a fan
of birthdays.
I know,

04:19.827 --> 04:21.629
but I'm very persuasive.
All right, now, Lavon,

04:21.661 --> 04:24.398
I hate to ask
on such short notice, but...

04:24.432 --> 04:26.634
You want to know
if you could have
it here.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.837
I'm not gonna be the most jovial
host, but, yeah, sure.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.705
Yes!
What can I do?

04:31.739 --> 04:33.040
Uh, decorations, playlist,

04:33.073 --> 04:34.174
and invite the Wilkes.

04:34.207 --> 04:37.678
Maybe not that judgey
Aunt Winifred, but all the rest.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.381
All right!
I gotta go do the invites!

04:40.414 --> 04:41.415
Okay.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.917
Hey, maybe you could invite
your dad to the party.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.319
I'd love to meet him.

04:45.353 --> 04:48.589
Oh, uh... yeah.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.058
Well, you know,
he's-he's busy that night.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.793
Working.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.428
He's, uh, working

04:54.462 --> 04:56.564
a lot of nights.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.666
Oh, yeah, he's
a hard worker.

04:58.699 --> 05:03.404
Sometimes he passes out
from working so hard.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.538
WADE:
Yeah.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.340
Okay.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.711
Splash of two-percent
like you said,

05:10.744 --> 05:11.712
Mr. Tucker, Esquire, sir.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.947
(chuckles) "George" will work
just fine, Tom.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.551
I'm not sure it expresses my
gratitude for the opportunity.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.753
You see, you saved me
from a super demeaning career

05:19.787 --> 05:21.088
that involved
my removing clothes

05:21.121 --> 05:23.624
and accepting dollar bills
as payment, which was...

05:23.657 --> 05:24.992
Right. Let's just, let's just

05:25.025 --> 05:26.727
try and start
our day of business.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.862
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

05:28.896 --> 05:29.963
Breakfast delivery!

05:29.997 --> 05:31.899
A Ms. Truitt is here
for you, sir!

05:31.932 --> 05:34.635
Little late on that, Tom,
but we'll work on it.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.969
Hey.
Hey.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.705
To what do I owe
this surprise?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.573
I have been thinking
about that kiss

05:39.607 --> 05:41.842
that we had,
that very excellent kiss.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.645
And I know afterward,
I said I wanted to take it slow,

05:44.678 --> 05:47.014
but I'm thinking maybe it's time
we moved this thing along.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.016
So I would like
to ask you to dinner...

05:49.049 --> 05:50.451
and dessert.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.985
Are you sure?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.854
This really something
you want to argue about?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.989
No, ma'am.
How's Saturday night sound?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.357
You're on.
Okay.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.864
Hey, A.B.!

06:03.897 --> 06:05.032
How are you doing?

06:05.065 --> 06:06.133
Great!

06:06.166 --> 06:08.135
Oh, you have some
powdered sugar...

06:08.168 --> 06:09.870
Oh. Right here?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.605
Did I get it?
Yep.

06:11.639 --> 06:14.675
Ah, yeah, we just had waffles
this morning at Lavon... Sorry.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.812
We just live there now,
so we, Joel and I,
went by there before...

06:18.846 --> 06:23.817
Zoe, you don't have to apologize
for seeing Lavon

06:23.851 --> 06:25.686
or eating at Lavon's.
(text alert sounds)

06:28.856 --> 06:31.158
Or having your birthday party
at Lavon's.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.493
Just got the invitation.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.961
That's weird for you.

06:33.994 --> 06:34.995
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.498
Just that you've been handling
all of this so well.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.166
We figured
that it would be fine.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.502
But I'm just gonna have
Joel change it. It's no problem.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.671
No, no, it's fine.
I can handle it.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.674
Okay.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.648
Crickett, you're right.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.049
I could use a distraction.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.951
I'll see you at the meeting.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.662
Oh, what is going
on in here?

07:08.696 --> 07:10.998
Okay, okay, get off!
Who is it?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.065
Scooter McGreevy?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.667
Greetings and peace, George!

07:13.701 --> 07:15.536
Okay, yeah, that's
enough of that.

07:15.569 --> 07:19.673
Scooter, what the hell
is going on?

07:19.707 --> 07:22.976
And what the hell
is with this getup?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.978
George, I've had an epiphany.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.581
I just got back
from a walkabout in Bhutan.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.017
Three weeks, the Himalayas,
no shoes,

07:30.050 --> 07:32.252
and I discovered
that I have been

07:32.285 --> 07:34.622
an absolute ogre
of a human being.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.223
I could have saved you
that entire trip.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.826
I hear your anger, bro,
and I get it.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.561
But I am changing,

07:40.594 --> 07:42.229
metamorphosing, if you will.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.831
Trying to heal the world.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.566
I quit my job with Mayor Gainey.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.902
I took a gig with GreenWorld
International in Mobile.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.038
Oh. You?
Defending the environment?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.173
It's not gonna defend itself,
now, is it?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.709
Okay, you'll understand me
when I say that this sounds

07:55.743 --> 07:57.845
like a truckload
of complete crap.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.981
I get it, Tucker.
Change is hard to accept.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.583
Just do me a favor.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.117
Don't tell Tansy you saw me.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.986
I'm not ready
to face her yet.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.156
I want to be full butterfly
before we re-meet.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.024
Yeah, don't worry
about that at all.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.595
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do my best
to forget all of this, okay?

08:14.628 --> 08:16.129
Good feelings
and harmony, man.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.497
Yeah.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.872
Hey! Great news!

08:24.905 --> 08:26.607
Everybody's coming
to the party.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.009
Half the town,
the entire Wilkes family.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.210
I have to admit,
I'm looking forward to it.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.613
I promise you,
this is a birthday
that you'll never forget.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.648
CANDACE:
Hello?! Anyone home?

08:34.682 --> 08:35.649
Holy crap.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.618
Hell no. Joel, tell me
you didn't invite my...

08:37.650 --> 08:39.086
Mom!

08:39.119 --> 08:41.922
Hi!
Hello.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.024
I can't believe this!
What are you doing here?

08:44.057 --> 08:46.894
Well, I waited for an invitation
to Thanksgiving,

08:46.927 --> 08:49.096
Hanukkah, Christmas--
never came.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.231
So I figured I wouldn't
let a lack of invitation

08:51.264 --> 08:54.167
keep me from
my only child's birthday.

08:54.201 --> 08:58.238
Joel, the South seems
to be treating you well.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.306
Yep.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.209
Except, no, you can't get away
with not shaving.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.944
Good note.
I'm guessing

09:03.977 --> 09:05.646
that Zoe steamrolled you

09:05.679 --> 09:07.581
into ignoring her big day,
am I right?

09:07.615 --> 09:08.849
Actually, no,
I was just planning...

09:08.882 --> 09:10.718
On ignoring it!
Like I said.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.987
No, I am taking
the two of you to dinner.

09:14.021 --> 09:17.124
Don't worry,
small, no fuss.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.927
No candles
that don't blow out. Fun?

09:19.960 --> 09:20.928
Fun!

09:20.961 --> 09:23.697
Great. I'm gonna go
check into the B and B,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.833
and I'll be right
back to catch up!

09:25.866 --> 09:27.067
What is happening?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.802
Why didn't you
tell her about the party?

09:28.836 --> 09:29.803
Because you're canceling it!

09:29.837 --> 09:30.771
What?! Why?

09:30.804 --> 09:33.206
My mother and I just managed
to put the past

09:33.240 --> 09:34.742
behind us, okay?
To build a relationship

09:34.775 --> 09:36.944
out of trust and honesty.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.211
You haven't told her
about the Wilkes.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.680
Yep.
Oy.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.681
Yep.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.083
(car horn honks)

09:43.116 --> 09:45.152
(seagulls calling)

09:45.185 --> 09:47.287
(birds singing)

09:58.198 --> 10:00.233
Did you cancel it?

10:00.267 --> 10:03.103
Uh, the Internet
is spotty here,
and I didn't want

10:03.136 --> 10:05.272
to leave a message for Lavon
last night.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.008
You mean that you were hoping
I'd change my mind overnight.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.310
Yes! You can't keep this
a secret forever.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.245
Yes, I can.
I purposely live

10:12.279 --> 10:14.147
2,000 miles away from my mother.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.316
A distance at which
painful truths,

10:16.349 --> 10:18.151
like replacing her
with my biological family,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.720
need never be spoken.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.855
It's very complicated
being you.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.256
Thank you for noticing.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.893
Now, will you please cancel
the party?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.194
Mom!

10:27.227 --> 10:28.796
Morning.
Hi.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.430
Well, I hope
that you got some rest.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.399
We have lots of things
to do today.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.267
Thought we'd, uh,
kick things off

10:34.301 --> 10:36.069
by taking a tour of the house.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.872
The house that
you both bought.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.874
Of course. No,
I'd love to see it.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.142
Well, I'll see you ladies later.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.044
I have some fun to dismantle.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.815
(clears throat)
Is he okay?

10:47.848 --> 10:49.750
Oh, you know writers,
always cranky about something.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.184
Huh.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.186
WADE:
Hey, there, Mrs. Doc.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.955
I didn't know you were in town.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.290
Oh, Mom, you remember Wade.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.826
(grunts)

10:58.859 --> 11:00.761
Yeah, I, uh,

11:00.794 --> 11:02.029
I think she remembers.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.430
Ooh.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.766
(laughter)

11:05.799 --> 11:08.769
Oh, you guys,
this is too much.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.971
Just a token of our appreciation
for your return.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.205
Okay, who's ready

11:12.239 --> 11:13.907
to start the meeting?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.175
ELODIE: We are thrilled
to have you back.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.443
You were missed.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.178
Terribly so.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.047
ANNABETH:
Oh, oh, my goodness.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.481
(gavel banging)
Okay, thank you.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.951
Okay, ladies, I believe someone

11:23.984 --> 11:26.186
who looks a lot like me
said the meeting was starting.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.220
We have priorities.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.822
Priorities?

11:28.856 --> 11:31.091
You mean like
not bankrupting us?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.459
SADIE:
Or moving up Belle events

11:32.492 --> 11:33.927
to pay our charter?

11:33.961 --> 11:35.362
ELODIE:
Or being unorganized?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.230
Or having terrible
people skills?
ANNABETH: Ladies,

11:37.264 --> 11:38.799
you know what?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.934
Let's focus
on the important things.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.070
I mean, have you heard
that the Mobile Marigolds

11:43.103 --> 11:45.405
have stolen our idea

11:45.438 --> 11:47.207
for a pink tea for
breast cancer awareness?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.708
Now, how are we
gonna retaliate?

11:52.245 --> 11:54.748
A blue tea for
prostate cancer.

11:54.782 --> 11:55.983
Yes.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.751
Yes!

11:57.785 --> 11:59.719
(mouthing)

12:02.890 --> 12:04.224
Okay, go double
on the peppered prawns

12:04.257 --> 12:06.126
and-and the sweet potato tarts.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.128
Yeah, all right,
thank you, thank you.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.830
(phone beeps)
Oh, there he is! Ha.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.364
The man that brought me
back to life.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.033
Wow, you, uh, you really...

12:13.066 --> 12:14.367
You really went all out here.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.502
(chuckles) Yeah.
Um...

12:15.535 --> 12:16.536
But we should talk, because,

12:16.569 --> 12:17.971
um, see, Zoe's mom...

12:18.005 --> 12:19.406
Well, it's the least
I could do.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.407
I mean, truth is,

12:20.440 --> 12:22.409
this is exactly
the kick in the pants I needed.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.244
You know, I mean,
this time yesterday,

12:24.277 --> 12:25.979
my house felt like a tomb,

12:26.013 --> 12:28.115
but today, look around.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.850
(chuckles)
It is filled with joy, Joel.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.118
Joy!

12:31.151 --> 12:32.986
(chuckles)
A-And streamers.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.287
Oh, yeah.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.289
Uh, what was it you wanted
to talk about?

12:36.323 --> 12:38.926
(sighs, laughs)

12:38.959 --> 12:40.894
So, this will be
the living room,

12:40.928 --> 12:42.262
dining room,

12:42.295 --> 12:43.530
games room, home gym.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.465
Plans are still in progress.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.534
Hey, you just missed
the po'boy truck.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.903
Earl, you're working
on my house?

12:49.937 --> 12:51.004
CANDACE:
Your insurance

12:51.038 --> 12:52.139
will not cover that.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.074
I drop by every now
and then to consult.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.575
Make sure my future
daughter-in-law

12:55.608 --> 12:57.477
is getting her money's worth.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.013
How's it going,
sister wife?

13:00.047 --> 13:03.283
Earl, you know that Wade and I
are no longer together, right?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.584
CANDACE:
And that even if they were,

13:04.617 --> 13:07.220
it wouldn't make me
your sister wife.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.322
I don't understand what
either one of you is saying.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.925
Although you look
real pretty saying it.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.561
I bought this house with
Joel, my new boyfriend.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.029
Been together a while.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.031
You've probably seen us
walking around town.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.466
You mean the-the guy
with the glasses?

13:19.499 --> 13:20.968
He carries that man purse?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.169
I thought
he was your brother.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.371
We hold hands. We kiss.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.873
Well, I figured you were
real close.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.176
Wade must be crushed.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.944
Wade is fine, I assure you.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.946
I think I better be
getting home.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.214
(sighs)

13:34.247 --> 13:36.950
I think this po'boy
is kicking back on me.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.453
GEORGE: Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.455
You-you watch that show, too?
Are you kidding me?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.423
I have seen every episode

13:43.456 --> 13:45.926
of Don Todd's
 Monster Golf Safari twice.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.461
The one in the Sahara
where he sinks the putt...

13:48.495 --> 13:50.597
Oh, when he's surrounded
by all those scorpions.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.632
Yeah.
I-I think that's my
favorite episode.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.334
Absolutely, actually.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.069
I... Oh, God.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.205
(George sighs)
Scott?

13:58.238 --> 13:59.539
Is that you?

13:59.572 --> 14:03.076
Tansy, I wasn't ready
for you to see me yet.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.611
Really?
That's why you're standing

14:04.644 --> 14:08.081
in the middle of town with
a giant white sign on you.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.116
Do you know the conditions

14:09.149 --> 14:10.617
that these poor animals
suffer for our whims?

14:10.650 --> 14:11.651
I had to come

14:11.684 --> 14:12.953
when I realized.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.621
Since when do you care
about animals?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.423
Since you, Tansy.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.126
Your compassion for animals,
for the environment,

14:19.159 --> 14:21.494
for humans in need,
it must have sunk in.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.263
When I lost you,

14:23.296 --> 14:25.032
I took a hard look at my life.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.634
I've made a lot of
mistakes and now

14:27.667 --> 14:29.569
I'm trying to right them.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.372
Okay, she's not falling
for any of this nonsense,

14:32.405 --> 14:33.573
(clears throat)
okay, Scooter?

14:33.606 --> 14:35.008
We got to get moving, so...

14:35.042 --> 14:36.643
Of course, but, Tansy,

14:36.676 --> 14:39.112
I hope that one day
you can forgive me

14:39.146 --> 14:41.982
and know that I
am trying so hard

14:42.015 --> 14:43.917
to be a better man.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.258
(groans)

14:51.291 --> 14:54.261
Please tell me you're not
buying into that phony.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.929
I mean, it's-it's
Scooter McGreevy.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.564
(chuckles) Right.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.033
It's just... Right.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.670
(sighs) Do you mind
if we call it a night?

15:03.703 --> 15:06.106
I've got this bit of a headache.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.045
Sure, sure, sure.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.280
I-I'll take you home.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.647
(chuckles)

15:16.483 --> 15:18.018
ZOE:
 I have already found

15:18.051 --> 15:20.287
some very promising tips online

15:20.320 --> 15:22.522
on how to get rid of that smell
in the garage.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.692
You hate the house, don't you?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.460
No, no, I...

15:27.494 --> 15:29.362
I love the house.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.564
Okay, so then why are you
all like...
(sighs)

15:31.598 --> 15:33.700
The house, Joel,

15:33.733 --> 15:36.569
forgotten holiday invites.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.973
You're setting
down roots here,

15:40.007 --> 15:42.175
building a future,
and I can't help but feel

15:42.209 --> 15:44.177
that there isn't
a place for me in it.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.712
You're shutting me out.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.314
What? No.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.182
No shutting out.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.318
We're celebrating
my birthday together, right?

15:51.351 --> 15:52.719
JOEL: Candace, did
you enjoy your day?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.587
The house is great,
isn't it?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.523
Zoe, quick sidebar.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.557
I'm so sorry.
Sure.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.060
Why not just shut me
out of the conversation, too?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.194
Okay.
Please tell me

16:01.228 --> 16:02.629
you cancelled the party?
Uh, no.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.331
I'm sorry. I tried
to pull the plug,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.199
but Lavon has gone
all out on that party.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.201
(groaning)
He told me it is
literally the only thing

16:08.235 --> 16:09.469
bringing him joy right now.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.504
If we cancel, I swear
he's gonna feed himself

16:11.538 --> 16:12.605
to Burt Reynolds.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.740
Well, my mother
is having a meltdown

16:13.773 --> 16:15.275
about not being
a part of my life, okay?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.676
She can't go to the party
and meet the Wilkes.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.211
It'll wreck her.
Yeah, well...

16:18.245 --> 16:19.412
(chuckles)

16:20.780 --> 16:22.349
Well, someone's gonna have to

16:22.382 --> 16:23.516
get wrecked, okay?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.752
Because you have a birthday
party and a birthday dinner,

16:25.785 --> 16:27.254
and you can't be in
two places at once.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.355
You're not Mrs. Doubtfire.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.789
I love that movie. (gasps)

16:29.822 --> 16:32.759
No, please. No...
no crazy ideas, please.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.127
All I wanted for my birthday

16:34.161 --> 16:35.762
was for no one's feelings
to get hurt, okay?

16:35.795 --> 16:37.364
(sighs)
Is that too much to ask?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.798
It's gonna be fine.
Trust me.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.433
I hate it when you say that.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.671
Oh. (chuckles)

16:51.144 --> 16:53.113
(country music playing
over phone)

16:53.146 --> 16:54.381
JOEL:
Breakfast in bed

16:54.414 --> 16:55.782
for the birthday girl!

16:55.815 --> 16:58.585
And now, as an additional gift,
I will not sing.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.819
(laughs) Waffles?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.254
Fruit? (gasps)

17:01.288 --> 17:02.555
What's this?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.590
(gasps)
Those earrings I was ogling

17:04.624 --> 17:06.259
at the vintage pop-up shop
in Mobile?

17:06.292 --> 17:07.493
I love you.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.163
Mwah. But you're
still not getting out
of that plan tonight.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.664
(sighing):
Oh, come on. Please.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.465
It's a really complicated plan.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.666
It's not. It's simple.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.803
You go to dinner with Candace
because I get called away

17:16.836 --> 17:18.204
for a medical emergency,

17:18.238 --> 17:19.739
only I'll really be
at the party with Lavon

17:19.771 --> 17:21.473
until I have to make up
an excuse about you,

17:21.508 --> 17:23.310
that "Joel's got
those headaches again,"

17:23.343 --> 17:24.611
and I'm back at the restaurant
in time for the cake

17:24.644 --> 17:25.678
with the candle.
It makes total sense.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.814
If you're Lucille Ball, yes.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.082
Look, please,

17:29.116 --> 17:30.583
please don't make me do this.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.484
Your mother
is very intimidating,

17:31.518 --> 17:33.286
and I get very nervous.
All you have to do

17:33.320 --> 17:34.621
is keep her occupied.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.556
Talk about her favorite subject,

17:36.589 --> 17:37.590
herself.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.192
Compliment her, easy peasy.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.365
(knocking)

17:45.398 --> 17:46.599
Oh, Tansy.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.767
Hey.
Hey, George.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.469
Have a minute?
Uh, yeah.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.504
Of course.
I thought it only right

17:51.538 --> 17:53.440
to let you know that after
we ran into him last night,

17:53.473 --> 17:54.707
I called Scott.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.709
Uh, what? No. Tansy, no.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.212
He asked if we could go
to dinner and talk some more.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.513
I said yes.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.215
Tansy, it's all an act.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.583
You don't know Scott like I do.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.519
I saw how working for Gainey
was eating him alive,

18:06.553 --> 18:09.122
and maybe he really is
trying to change.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.790
I think I owe him the courtesy

18:10.823 --> 18:12.759
of at least listening
to what he has to say.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.495
I'm sorry, George.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.197
I'll call you later.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.198
Yeah, of course.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.099
(chuckling)

18:27.440 --> 18:28.475
(clears throat)

18:28.508 --> 18:30.243
Hey, y'all.
What are you doing here?

18:30.277 --> 18:32.245
Please don't say pies.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.214
AnnaBeth,
the SS Belle is sailing

18:34.247 --> 18:36.916
straight over a waterfall
thanks to Captain Crickett.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.219
Oh, come on, y'all.
Crickett's not that bad.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.288
She makes Judy Prescott cry
every day.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.922
Judy Prescott,
winner of

18:42.955 --> 18:45.225
"The Happiest Girl in BlueBell"
six years running.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.793
The point is we
are voting Crickett

18:46.826 --> 18:48.228
off the throne,

18:48.261 --> 18:49.896
and we want you to go up
in her place.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.631
What? No.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.765
SADIE:
AnnaBeth, what better way

18:52.799 --> 18:53.766
to get over your breakup

18:53.800 --> 18:55.702
than to pour yourself
into fixing the Belles?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.770
Can't say
it's not tempting, but...

18:57.804 --> 18:59.539
Please, just think about it.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.641
All right, ladies,

19:01.674 --> 19:02.909
quietly now,

19:02.942 --> 19:05.412
reverse and disperse.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.953
Okay.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.655
EARL:
 I can't believe

19:15.688 --> 19:16.556
you didn't tell me

19:16.589 --> 19:18.791
that you and that pretty doctor
broke up.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.427
I thought you knew.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.695
It was pretty public.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.831
For a few months there,
wasn't a day went by

19:24.864 --> 19:27.534
that I didn't get slapped
as a result of it.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.801
I could've been there for you.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.703
Seen you through your heartache.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.405
Thank you, Dad,

19:32.439 --> 19:33.473
but I'm fine.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.808
And I happen to be in a
great new relationship.

19:35.842 --> 19:36.976
Really?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.545
When am I gonna meet her?

19:38.578 --> 19:39.679
Oh, I reckon
I could pencil you in

19:39.712 --> 19:42.282
for sometime early 2016.

19:42.315 --> 19:45.552
(chuckles) You embarrassed
of me or something?

19:45.585 --> 19:47.420
I love you, Pop, but remember

19:47.454 --> 19:49.456
when you had those
business cards printed up,

19:49.489 --> 19:52.559
and it said "Crazy Earl"
right there in black and white?

19:52.592 --> 19:53.893
I figured that's how
people know me.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.495
Exactly.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.597
I'll talk to
you later, Dad.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.633
(groaning)

20:00.667 --> 20:03.303
Scooter's doing tai chi
in town square.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.471
I had to avert my eyes.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.739
It's practically
public indecency.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.577
That phony,
no-good, fake phony.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.578
I just don't get how Tansy

20:11.611 --> 20:12.979
can't see he's lying.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.748
As your new assistant,
I will investigate,

20:15.782 --> 20:17.450
find out what's really
going on with him,

20:17.484 --> 20:19.452
Mr. George Tucker, sir.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.621
That's not really
in your job description, Tom.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.590
But do it anyway.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.425
(laughing)

20:27.494 --> 20:28.995
Hey, guys.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.997
Joel, you really do have
a tardiness problem.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.465
So...

20:32.499 --> 20:33.866
who's ready
for their birthday dinner?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.768
Me!
I am.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.604
Well, not my...
I know... (chuckles)

20:37.637 --> 20:39.339
It's her birthday.
I'm just gonna be

20:39.372 --> 20:40.407
coming along to it also.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.608
Um...

20:41.641 --> 20:43.743
Wow, your teeth
look bright today, Candace.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.446
Thank you.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.816
(Zoe clears throat)
Uh, yeah, uh...

20:53.386 --> 20:54.554
(phone ringing)
Oh.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.055
Sorry, I have to get this.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.890
(beeps)

20:57.924 --> 20:59.359
Hey, Shula.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.760
What's up?

21:00.793 --> 21:01.894
Stomach pain?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.496
Oh, how bad?

21:03.530 --> 21:05.365
Yeah, it's probably
your gallstone.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.633
But I'm in the middle
of something, and I...

21:06.666 --> 21:07.800
Honey...
One second.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.536
Oh, sorry,
I'll be off soon.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.037
If you have
to see a patient...

21:11.070 --> 21:12.372
Uh... no!

21:12.405 --> 21:13.440
I-I don't.
We have plans.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.774
It sounds like she needs you.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.977
Well, Shula just doesn't
like change, is all.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.078
Listen,

21:19.111 --> 21:20.913
you go take
care of Shula,

21:20.947 --> 21:23.082
Joel and I will get settled
at the restaurant.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.651
Are you sure?

21:24.684 --> 21:25.618
Mm-hmm.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.056
Shula, hey,
you're in luck.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.591
I'm on my way.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.825
Okay.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.427
I will be as
fast as I can.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.795
Joel, you know what
to order for me, right?

21:35.828 --> 21:38.598
If I don't,
I will make something up.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.066
Joel, are you all right?

21:40.099 --> 21:41.401
You look clammy.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.069
(laughs nervously)

21:43.102 --> 21:44.804
No, no, I'm-I'm fine.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.574
Um... but you,
however,

21:47.607 --> 21:49.976
you just look...

21:50.009 --> 21:51.444
Have I mentioned your teeth?

21:51.478 --> 21:53.680
Uh, you did, yeah.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.715
I'll be quick!
I promise.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.718
(quietly):
Move on from the teeth!

22:08.595 --> 22:09.962
(people talking, laughing)

22:09.996 --> 22:11.964
Just try to hold it together.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.466
It hasn't even been that long.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.603
It feels like hours.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.871
If judgment had a face,
it would be your mother's.

22:18.905 --> 22:19.906
That is so true.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.708
Look, I'm gonna try
to speed things up, okay?

22:21.741 --> 22:24.043
But just try to keep
steering the conversation

22:24.076 --> 22:26.112
towards her favorite subject:
herself.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.047
Bye.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.450
(sighs)

22:30.483 --> 22:32.619
(humming nervously)

22:32.652 --> 22:33.853
Lavon!

22:33.886 --> 22:34.854
Hey!

22:34.887 --> 22:36.055
This is
so amazing.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.457
I can't believe you
did all this for me.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.491
But can we keep
the momentum going?

22:38.525 --> 22:39.859
Maybe we could
do the cake now?

22:39.892 --> 22:41.027
Are you sure?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.395
It's still early.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.596
Where's Joel?

22:43.630 --> 22:44.897
Poor guy. He's sick.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.032
He's missing all the fun.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.134
Plus, Brando
and his buddies,

22:48.167 --> 22:49.936
they have to leave
for their charity game.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.738
Horseshoes for heart disease
or something.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.640
And Grandpa Brando,
he loves his cake, so...

22:54.907 --> 22:56.643
You're the birthday girl, huh?
Cake!

22:56.676 --> 22:58.911
Yes, I am.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.647
A.B.!

23:00.680 --> 23:03.916
You came!

23:03.950 --> 23:06.553
Oh, I am so, so,
so glad to see you.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.920
Uh, are you okay
being here?

23:07.954 --> 23:09.155
I'm great.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.690
Of course I'm here.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.759
I mean, I wouldn't
miss all this.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.627
Oh, no.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.663
Earl is six

23:16.696 --> 23:18.631
king-sized sheets
to the wind.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.632
Shoot.

23:19.666 --> 23:20.633
Will you excuse me one second?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.635
Mm-hmm.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.171
My, my, my.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.840
You and Lavon here
at the same party

23:27.874 --> 23:31.644
just one week after your
soul-crushing split.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.112
Inspiring.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.915
If it was me,
I'd be lying on
the rail tracks.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.084
But seriously,
you are the most

23:38.117 --> 23:39.819
mature person
I've ever met.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.053
How do you
do it?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.021
Just, you know,

23:42.054 --> 23:45.658
finding various
civil-minded distractions.

23:45.692 --> 23:46.959
Rejoined
the Belles.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.795
Oh.
And...

23:48.828 --> 23:51.531
where is the bar?

23:51.564 --> 23:52.965
Is it... bup... oh!

23:52.999 --> 23:54.133
Yes.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.568
Oh, uh...

23:55.602 --> 23:57.069
Earl...

23:57.103 --> 23:58.104
How ya been,
what you doing?

23:58.137 --> 23:59.105
Do you know where you are?

23:59.138 --> 24:00.807
I'm here to introduce myself

24:00.840 --> 24:02.809
to Wade's new girlfriend.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.478
(sniffs, laughs)

24:05.512 --> 24:07.814
He doesn't want me
to meet her,

24:07.847 --> 24:09.115
but I think it's
a real good idea.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.483
Don't you?

24:10.517 --> 24:12.084
Um...
Will you
just... just

24:12.118 --> 24:14.153
point me in the right
direction and push?

24:14.186 --> 24:16.823
You know, I think
I saw her in-in the study.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.725
Oh. Here?
Mm-hmm.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.863
How's Shula?

24:23.896 --> 24:25.898
Zoe's patient.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.836
Complications.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.571
Nothing
life-threatening,

24:31.604 --> 24:33.640
but just
time-consuming

24:33.673 --> 24:36.175
and just very
complicated
complications.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.110
Um... you know what,

24:38.144 --> 24:39.846
though, it's a bunch
of medical mumbo-jumbo.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.848
I never understand
what she's saying anyway.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.250
But she's... she's gonna
be here very soon.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.317
You know, Joel,
I have to say

24:45.351 --> 24:47.687
I am very disappointed
with what's going on here.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.223
And I can't believe you
allowed it to happen.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.126
I allowed it to happen?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.194
How did this become my fault?

24:55.227 --> 24:57.196
This is not...
This was Zoe's i...

24:57.229 --> 24:58.865
Wait.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.299
I'm sorry, what do you
think I allowed?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.902
You allowed her
to move to BlueBell,

25:02.935 --> 25:03.770
to buy a house,

25:03.803 --> 25:07.139
to set down roots
1,000 miles from me.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.208
I had a very
happy summer

25:09.241 --> 25:10.877
in New York
with my daughter.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.179
Even happier
when she found

25:13.212 --> 25:15.147
a New York
boyfriend.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.650
Yet somehow,
we're back here.

25:17.684 --> 25:18.951
I blame you.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.187
This is fun, though, huh?

25:21.220 --> 25:22.789
Isn't it?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.090
Just a real
chance for us

25:24.123 --> 25:27.059
to get to know
each other.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.732
*

25:34.000 --> 25:35.768
TOM:
Are you sure you want me
to tell you everything?

25:35.802 --> 25:37.036
Because once I say it,
it can't be unheard.

25:37.069 --> 25:37.870
GEORGE:
Tom...

25:37.904 --> 25:39.906
Okay, I verified
with Gainey's people.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.174
McGreevy did
give his notice.
Really?

25:42.208 --> 25:43.976
However, as of
at least noon today,

25:44.010 --> 25:45.645
there is no associate
named Scott McGreevy

25:45.678 --> 25:46.913
at GreenWorld in Mobile.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.215
See, I knew he didn't develop
a passion for the environment.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.349
What is he up to?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.351
Well, I did find
a law firm in Mobile

25:52.384 --> 25:54.687
that does have an associate
named S. McGreevy.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.856
It's called
Bannister & Grigsby.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.925
Of course.
Of course!

25:58.958 --> 25:59.992
Bannister & Grigsby!

26:00.026 --> 26:01.728
Tom, you are
a rock star.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.329
Thank you.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.931
"Rock star."

26:04.964 --> 26:06.799
Can we add that
to my official title?

26:06.833 --> 26:08.801
No?

26:08.835 --> 26:10.670
Okay, but... uh...
think about it.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.672
Take your time.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.073
Get back to me.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.008
What do you say you and me
have a quick celebration

26:16.042 --> 26:17.810
of our own
over at my place?
Mm.

26:17.844 --> 26:20.279
We could be there and back
before anyone even notices.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.681
Well, that's
tempting.

26:21.714 --> 26:22.849
But we cannot leave.

26:22.882 --> 26:23.850
(laughs)

26:23.883 --> 26:25.852
Oh, hey, great idea.
Hall closet.

26:25.885 --> 26:26.953
What do you say?

26:26.986 --> 26:27.954
Hey, buddy.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.822
The host is asking for you.

26:29.856 --> 26:30.990
Something about getting
rid of an armadillo

26:31.023 --> 26:32.158
that wandered
into the party.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.359
Ugh, yuck.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.694
No, you're
on your own.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.729
Hmm-mm.
All right.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.700
If you and Wade
were still together,

26:40.733 --> 26:41.968
I bet you'd
make sure

26:42.001 --> 26:43.369
he'd let me meet
his new girlfriend.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.704
Sure, yes.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.839
Absolutely.
I...

26:46.873 --> 26:48.708
You know, I would have
preferred an actual armadillo.

26:48.741 --> 26:49.709
Oh, there you are.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.010
Hey, Dad.
Oh...

26:51.043 --> 26:52.979
I wanna meet this new
girlfriend of yours.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.714
People love me.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.415
Hey, come on, Daddy,
you're in no shape

26:56.448 --> 26:58.751
to be making new friends,
all right?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.186
I'm in the best
shape of my life.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.988
Hit me
in the gut.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.990
Go on. Go on.
WADE:
All right.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.124
Time to say good night.
Come on, let's go home.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.125
No, no,
forget it.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.194
Changed my mind.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.730
I don't wanna meet
your new girlfriend.

27:10.763 --> 27:11.998
I already don't like her.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.133
She'll never measure
up to this one.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.802
Never.
Earl...

27:15.835 --> 27:18.004
It's a father's duty
to tell the truth.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.305
And the truth is

27:19.338 --> 27:20.907
you two made a big mistake

27:20.940 --> 27:22.008
letting each other go.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.777
I knew that.
It's a...

27:24.811 --> 27:26.012
tragedy, is what it is.

27:26.045 --> 27:30.149
It's like
Romeo and...

27:30.182 --> 27:31.918
Mrs. Romeo.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.085
All right.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.787
Time to say good night.
Come on.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.088
Upsy-daisy,
let's go, Dad.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.791
WADE:
Uh...

27:38.825 --> 27:40.159
Tell Viv I'll be right back,
all right?

27:40.192 --> 27:42.929
And...
thank you.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.031
Come on.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.432
Pay attention
to walking, all right?

27:46.465 --> 27:47.967
Come on.
What's this thing?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.002
(guests cheering)

27:56.408 --> 27:58.377
AnnaBeth.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.979
Lavon!
Hey. Hi.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.180
I'm... I'm glad
you made it.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.448
You know, I wasn't
sure you'd be here.

28:02.481 --> 28:05.084
Of course I'm here.
Celebrating Zoe. Yay!

28:05.117 --> 28:06.352
Where'd you think
I'd be,

28:06.385 --> 28:08.054
sitting at home,
feeling sorry for myself?

28:08.087 --> 28:10.456
No. No, I didn't
expect you to be.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.825
Why not?
What?

28:12.859 --> 28:15.061
Why shouldn't I be sitting at
home feeling sorry for myself?

28:15.094 --> 28:16.062
I-I didn't say that.
You know what

28:16.095 --> 28:18.865
I keep hearing?
How civilized this breakup is,

28:18.898 --> 28:20.266
how great I'm doing.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.400
Well, it's all poppycock.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.202
AnnaBeth, you sound
a little angry.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.470
I am angry. And sad.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.005
And it's all your fault.
And you should

28:26.038 --> 28:27.506
know that because
I gave you my heart

28:27.539 --> 28:29.475
and you used it like a dishrag.
And truth is,

28:29.508 --> 28:32.411
you probably would've been happy
just stringing me along forever.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.946
No, that's not true. I'm...

28:33.980 --> 28:35.748
Look, th-this is not the place.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.751
You know what? One day,
I'm gonna meet someone else,

28:38.785 --> 28:41.087
someone who will love me
the way I deserve

28:41.120 --> 28:42.822
to be loved,
and you will realize

28:42.855 --> 28:44.857
how stupid you were
to let me go

28:44.891 --> 28:46.492
because I am the best thing
that ever happened to you.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.961
But in the meantime,
I am done being civil

28:48.995 --> 28:51.130
and polite and quiet!

28:51.163 --> 28:52.865
(others stop talking)

28:52.899 --> 28:54.433
God.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.435
(glass clinking)

29:00.406 --> 29:01.808
(talking resumes)

29:06.946 --> 29:08.781
Her fish is cold,

29:08.815 --> 29:11.851
her gazpacho's warm...
I know it may
seem like

29:11.884 --> 29:14.420
we're dining with Godot here...
(chuckles)

29:14.453 --> 29:15.855
It's just--

29:15.888 --> 29:17.523
a little Beckett reference--
um, but I'm sure

29:17.556 --> 29:20.526
that Zoe will be finished
with Shula at any second now.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.328
SHULA:
What's that, dear?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.130
I heard my name.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.898
What you want?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.399
Uh...

29:27.433 --> 29:30.803
I said "hula."

29:30.837 --> 29:32.438
"Hula." D...

29:32.471 --> 29:35.307
Don't mind us. Okay.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.276
I was
 really hoping

29:37.309 --> 29:41.881
this wasn't another
of my daughter's crazy schemes.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.049
Joel.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.018
Tell me

29:46.052 --> 29:47.186
what is going on.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.191
You're a very intimidating kind
of person, did you know that?

29:54.460 --> 29:56.428
Oh. Bye. Thank you for coming.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.496
Zoe Hart,

29:57.529 --> 29:58.564
you're not leaving already,
are you?

29:58.597 --> 29:59.966
Oh, yeah. I
have to bail.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.301
I'm so sorry,
but it's been amazing.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.135
Joel isn't
feeling well, so...

30:03.169 --> 30:04.370
You want me
to bring over some soup?

30:04.403 --> 30:07.940
I got a spicy chicken noodle
knock the cold off an Eskimo.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.842
Oh, no. I could not risk
getting you sick.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.911
That would be
one bad birthday memory.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.479
(chuckles)
Okay. Bye-bye.
Ciao for now.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.515
Oh, Lavon. Hey.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.484
Thank you for everything.
I got to go.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.352
What... Is something wrong?

30:20.386 --> 30:22.054
No.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.355
Okay.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.624
Zoe.
Huh?

30:25.657 --> 30:29.361
Uh, I-I know Joel is
sick, but I got to know...

30:29.395 --> 30:31.197
why do I hurt everybody
I care about?

30:31.230 --> 30:32.464
I mean, please,

30:32.498 --> 30:35.067
don't leave. I-I need to
know why I'm broken.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.368
You're my
best friend.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.004
You're a doctor.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.405
Diagnose me.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.440
(phone rings)

30:43.375 --> 30:45.411
Hang in there, sweetie.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.880
It's gonna be
a little while longer.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.216
(clears throat)

30:50.249 --> 30:51.517
(sighs)

30:59.591 --> 31:01.593
(footsteps approaching)

31:10.402 --> 31:12.138
(chuckles)
Rough night?

31:12.171 --> 31:15.641
Yep. I lost it.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.643
I got so sick of everyone
telling me

31:17.676 --> 31:20.412
how great
I'm handling everything.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.282
Being a beacon of
responsibility can be hard.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.918
Believe me, I know
all too well.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.189
I think the Belles are
gonna vote me out tomorrow.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.058
I think so, too.

31:32.091 --> 31:35.261
Well, thanks for at least
trying to help out.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.396
I know we haven't been
that close lately.

31:37.429 --> 31:41.167
But you and Lemon are my
oldest and dearest friends.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.937
And I know you always
have my back.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.273
So if there's anything
you want me

31:47.306 --> 31:49.408
to do to Lavon, I will.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.310
My mom has this great recipe

31:51.343 --> 31:53.212
for chocolate chip cookies
that induce the runs.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.346
Oh!

31:54.380 --> 31:56.015
(laughing)

31:56.048 --> 31:57.316
Thank you, Crickett.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.718
But stand down.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.919
All right.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.424
You meet the perfect person and
your problems go away, right?

32:05.457 --> 32:06.425
That's how it's
supposed to work?

32:06.458 --> 32:09.361
What if I'm the problem?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.463
What if there's
something wrong with me?

32:11.497 --> 32:13.232
No, Lavon, there's
nothing wrong with you.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.366
Well, A.B. is amazing.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.434
In every way.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.703
I love her.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.938
But something
just pulled me back.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.608
I can't give her what she wants.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.977
And-and what if that's
the biggest mistake of my life?

32:25.011 --> 32:27.446
No. The biggest mistake
of your life

32:27.479 --> 32:29.515
would be proposing
or marrying someone

32:29.548 --> 32:31.717
you're not 110% sure is the one.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.386
Lavon, I know you hated
hurting AnnaBeth.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.721
But eventually,

32:35.754 --> 32:38.224
all that lying, it would've
blown up in your face.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.393
You're right.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.597
Thank you.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.467
Well, I guess you should
go find Joel now.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.202
Actually, right now, I think

32:50.236 --> 32:52.704
I have to go infuriate
my mother.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.346
(laughter)

33:00.379 --> 33:02.614
Yeah, kind of.
Isn't that true?

33:02.648 --> 33:05.017
Oh, I-I mean...

33:05.051 --> 33:06.618
Tansy, can I talk
to you for a second?

33:06.652 --> 33:07.619
Uh...
Hey.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.554
How's it going, buddy?

33:08.587 --> 33:11.223
George, maybe now's
not the right time.

33:11.257 --> 33:12.758
No, now is the right time.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.226
Maybe the best time.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.494
You're gonna want to hear this.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.230
Do you want to man up and tell
her what's really going on here?

33:18.264 --> 33:19.698
Or are you gonna make me do it?

33:19.731 --> 33:22.634
George, I do not know to
what you are referring.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.570
That's how you're
gonna play this?

33:24.603 --> 33:26.305
Okay.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.640
Scooter's lying
about his big life change.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.277
His new environmental job.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.145
Yeah, he's going
to Mobile to work

33:33.179 --> 33:35.514
for a big, dirty,
earth-pillaging,

33:35.547 --> 33:37.449
animal-hating, money-grubbing,

33:37.483 --> 33:39.518
giant, evil corporate law firm.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.653
Boom! G-Tuck dropping
truth hammers.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.290
Scott, is that true?

33:44.323 --> 33:46.258
And is there such a place?

33:46.292 --> 33:48.127
No to the first.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.828
And, sadly, yes to the second.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.397
Bannister & Grigsby.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.265
I used to worship that firm.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.267
(chuckles)
Used to? Used to.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.803
Liar. Tell me this.

33:57.836 --> 34:00.439
Why do the good people at
GreenWorld not have you listed

34:00.472 --> 34:02.408
on their roster
as a new associate?

34:02.441 --> 34:04.843
Probably because I'm not.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.545
They hired me as a partner.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.547
Okay, and what
about Bannister & Grigsby?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.549
Mr. Tucker? Sir?
You expect me to believe
that it's just a coincidence

34:10.581 --> 34:12.551
George? G-Tuck?
that they have a S. McGreevy
working for them right now?

34:12.583 --> 34:13.752
I'm sorry...
What, Tom?!

34:13.784 --> 34:15.821
I am on a roll here.
I just called
the number listed

34:15.853 --> 34:17.289
for S. McGreevy because
I was gonna leave

34:17.322 --> 34:18.157
this mean voice mail like,

34:18.190 --> 34:20.159
"Oh, we got you,
Sleezeball McGreedy,"

34:20.192 --> 34:22.594
but then a woman picked up,
said her name was Sara.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.862
"S" for Sara.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.197
Said she's Scooter's cousin.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.565
That she is.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.202
I've been trying to get her
to quit that awful job.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.438
"McGreedy."
(chuckles)

34:32.471 --> 34:33.572
That's funny.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.873
And it's very effective.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.475
Kudos.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.478
I see how this could
look very bad on me.

34:39.511 --> 34:40.879
(laughs)

34:40.911 --> 34:42.880
Enjoy your meal.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.117
And your evening.

34:48.219 --> 34:50.222
(laughs nervously)
It's...

34:51.889 --> 34:53.725
ZOE:
 Joel, thank God you picked up.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.194
Zoe, listen.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.228
No, you don't have to say it.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.596
You were right about everything.

34:57.629 --> 34:58.897
I have to tell my mom
about the Wilkes.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.332
The longer I hide the truth,

35:00.366 --> 35:01.800
the bigger it's gonna
blow up in my face.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.735
Bring my mother to the party.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.771
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.642
Just means you're more likely
to forgive me later.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.779
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

35:23.655 --> 35:24.890
JOEL:
This is going better
than we ever expected.

35:24.923 --> 35:25.891
She's not even upset.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.759
it's just as
likely that that's

35:27.793 --> 35:29.695
a very lifelike
Candace robot.

35:29.728 --> 35:30.762
VIVIAN: Zoe?

35:30.796 --> 35:31.763
I cannot believe you did not

35:31.797 --> 35:33.232
tell us your mother was coming.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.233
This is a great surprise!

35:34.266 --> 35:35.934
Well, what's a birthday
without a surprise?

35:35.967 --> 35:38.404
You got a special girl,
Mrs. Hart.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.239
I do.
We love your daughter.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.774
Meeting her has been
a complete godsend.

35:42.808 --> 35:43.942
And we want to get
to know you, too.

35:43.975 --> 35:44.943
Come on.

35:44.976 --> 35:45.944
Meet the rest
of the family.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.179
Oh, there's more of you.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.180
Bring them on.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.448
(sighs)

35:51.317 --> 35:53.252
Come on,
that's got to feel good.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.686
Yes, it does.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.423
So why can't I stop looking
for the other shoe to drop?

35:58.557 --> 35:59.691
Oh, it's NPO.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.394
Naturally pessimistic outlook.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.830
But don't worry, we're
gonna work on that.

36:06.898 --> 36:07.933
(gavel bangs)

36:07.966 --> 36:11.270
Time to call this
meeting to order.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.939
When the gavel goes up,
the mouth goes shut.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.408
Okay,
new business.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.977
I move for an immediate
emergency recall vote,

36:19.010 --> 36:20.679
removing you,
Crickett,

36:20.712 --> 36:21.947
as Head Belle.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.283
You're controlling
and mean.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.285
You let the power
go to your head.

36:26.318 --> 36:29.855
So, I nominate AnnaBeth Nass
to take your place.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.860
I accept. (laughs)

36:37.329 --> 36:40.566
I am so grateful
to be given this chance.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.502
From now on, Belles are
gonna stick together,

36:43.535 --> 36:44.903
through thick
and thin,

36:44.936 --> 36:47.706
so I'm gonna nominate
a co-leader...

36:47.739 --> 36:49.308
Crickett Watts.

36:49.341 --> 36:52.278
I won't do it
without her.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.583
Fine.
(clears throat)

36:57.616 --> 36:58.884
All in favor?

37:06.692 --> 37:09.261
You know, it means a lot
to me that your dad made time

37:09.295 --> 37:10.729
in his schedule
to meet me.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.731
Uh, full disclosure...

37:12.764 --> 37:15.601
Earl might have a little more
free time than I let on.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.869
I kind of had a feeling.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.339
The problem's mine,
not his, okay?

37:20.372 --> 37:22.874
Guess I wasn't keen
on an introduction

37:22.908 --> 37:25.344
because, on occasion,

37:25.377 --> 37:28.280
Earl can get
a little... odd.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.048
And drunk.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.783
And for
whatever reason,

37:31.817 --> 37:35.821
I didn't want anything
to change what you think of me.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.389
Was that so hard to say?

37:38.690 --> 37:41.493
Nothing's gonna change
what I think of you.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.261
For whatever reason.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.766
(leaves rustling)

37:47.799 --> 37:50.769
Oh, my goodness,
what do we have here?

37:50.802 --> 37:52.538
Either Sunday
came early this week,

37:52.571 --> 37:54.973
or my dad dressed up
to meet you.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.542
Step on over here, you two.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.977
Let me get a good
look at you.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.313
My, my, aren't you
a handsome couple.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.814
Vivian, I want you
to meet my dad.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.049
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.651
Oh, it's great
to meet you.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.286
(chuckles)
People call me Earl.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.737
Hey, Tansy.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.674
If this is another attempt
to discredit Scott...

38:28.707 --> 38:29.708
I'm sorry.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.078
I came here to
say I'm sorry.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.547
For all of it.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.948
It's been a roller coaster.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.750
Yeah, the kind where
you're upside down,

38:38.784 --> 38:40.719
loop after loop, strapped
in only by your feet.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.887
I love those kind.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.691
So, you and
Scooter? You, uh...

38:45.724 --> 38:47.526
Giving it another shot.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.563
George, you know
how I feel about you,

38:51.597 --> 38:53.765
but I have history
with Scott, too.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.768
In spite of myself,
I loved him. I...

38:56.802 --> 38:59.104
I still do,
and maybe now he's

38:59.137 --> 39:01.573
actually worthy of it.

39:01.607 --> 39:05.777
He changed for me, and nobody
has ever done that before.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.049
I hope that it
works out for you.

39:12.518 --> 39:13.652
Truly.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.621
Truly, I do.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.124
I'll see you around.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.759
(soft chuckle)
Actually, um...

39:20.792 --> 39:23.995
I promised Scott that I would
quit the Rammer Jammer.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.997
I think he knew
how hard it would be

39:26.031 --> 39:27.466
to see you every day.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.468
But he got me
a job in Mobile

39:29.501 --> 39:32.604
at an actual
hair salon, so...

39:32.638 --> 39:35.607
So, this is good-bye.

39:35.641 --> 39:36.875
Who knows.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.143
It is us. (chuckles)

39:38.176 --> 39:39.811
And we have the worst
relationship luck

39:39.845 --> 39:41.913
of any two people
I have ever known.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.616
You'd think that would've meant
we're perfect for each other.

39:44.650 --> 39:45.784
(laughs)

39:48.053 --> 39:49.855
All right, then.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.192
Good-bye, Tans.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.927
Bye.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.041
ZOE:
There you are.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.545
Buy you breakfast
on your last day in BlueBell?

40:13.579 --> 40:16.582
Well, I don't know, did you
have a secret first breakfast

40:16.615 --> 40:17.983
with your other family?

40:18.016 --> 40:20.586
Hmm. Okay, I deserved that.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.655
I am sorry that I didn't
tell you about them sooner.

40:23.689 --> 40:25.657
I know, dear.
I was worried
you would feel hurt.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.225
But now that it's all
out in the open,

40:27.258 --> 40:29.194
I realized that there was
nothing to worry about

40:29.227 --> 40:30.529
to begin with.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.964
I'm so glad that you
came and met them.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.199
It was a great birthday.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.534
It was, and you're right--

40:35.567 --> 40:37.202
the Wilkes are terrific.

40:37.235 --> 40:39.805
Loyal, caring.
A great family.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.973
Yeah, it's nice
to have them here.
I know, and that's why

40:42.007 --> 40:43.475
I can't let them win.

40:43.509 --> 40:44.876
Hmm? Win?

40:44.910 --> 40:46.845
Who win? Win what?
You, Zoe.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.214
If BlueBell is where you're
gonna have your life--

40:49.247 --> 40:51.583
a house, a family,
eventually grandbabies--

40:51.617 --> 40:53.685
well if this is where
it's gonna be, then this

40:53.719 --> 40:55.153
is where I'm gonna be.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.822
I'm staying.

40:56.855 --> 40:57.889
In BlueBell.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.759
Uh, BlueBell, Alabama?

41:00.792 --> 41:03.829
Hey, so...

41:03.862 --> 41:04.863
what'd I miss?

41:04.896 --> 41:07.899
The other shoe.
