WEBVTT

01:18.588 --> 01:19.656
Thank you.

01:23.826 --> 01:24.894
Hi, I'm back.

01:26.829 --> 01:28.430
Sorry it took so long.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.866
The line was crazy.

01:29.899 --> 01:30.867
We're all in here.

01:37.774 --> 01:38.841
I didn't miss it, did I?

01:40.442 --> 01:41.543
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

01:45.547 --> 01:47.215
They almost ran
out. I got the last tray.

01:47.249 --> 01:48.918
They're still pretty warm,
so don't heat them too long.

01:48.951 --> 01:49.986
And leave the attar on the side.

01:50.019 --> 01:51.253
Hassan doesn't like it on top.

01:51.286 --> 01:52.487
- He likes to dip it.
- Okay.

02:01.631 --> 02:02.632
Not my recipe.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.734
Uh, where's Hassan?

02:27.690 --> 02:28.490
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:29.025 --> 02:30.492
<i>Yallah,</i>
five minutes until Iftar.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.962
And I got fresh
Kanafeh for dessert.

02:32.995 --> 02:34.897
Ugh, the line was so long.

02:34.931 --> 02:35.932
Mo, I, uh...

02:37.633 --> 02:38.701
You okay?

02:40.803 --> 02:42.537
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:42.905 --> 02:43.906
Yeah.

02:44.841 --> 02:46.441
Something's wrong. Tell me.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.811
Let's just do this another time.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.748
Okay? Uh, your family
is here, and...

02:52.115 --> 02:54.617
It's the last Iftar. I know
how important that is to you.

02:54.817 --> 02:56.485
Plus, I hear there's
fresh Kanafeh.

02:57.019 --> 02:58.020
Hassan.

03:02.324 --> 03:04.392
My cousin threatened
to out me today.

03:04.627 --> 03:06.662
This again?
And what did she say this time?

03:07.930 --> 03:09.031
Uh...

03:09.065 --> 03:10.733
She, uh...

03:14.070 --> 03:15.972
She found my secret
Facebook profile.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.274
Yeah.

03:19.809 --> 03:22.344
And she said it was
her Islamic duty to tell my dad.

03:22.377 --> 03:23.378
And has she?

03:23.646 --> 03:24.647
I don't know.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.415
I've been calling him
and texting all day.

03:27.449 --> 03:28.684
He hasn't been responding.

03:28.718 --> 03:29.786
Hmm.

03:29.819 --> 03:30.820
Yeah. This could kill him.

03:31.053 --> 03:32.688
That's a bit over-the-top.

03:32.722 --> 03:33.756
Plus, you're not married

03:33.790 --> 03:35.658
and practically
80 in Arab years.

03:36.159 --> 03:38.094
Do you really think people
don't know by now?

03:38.127 --> 03:39.762
Mo, I'm serious.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.464
I'm scared.
I don't know if he can recover

03:42.497 --> 03:43.666
from something like this.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.367
Did you delete your profile?

03:45.400 --> 03:46.869
Yes, of course, I
deleted my profile.

03:46.903 --> 03:48.938
Then why don't you do
what you always do?

03:49.639 --> 03:52.541
Tell him it isn't true,
gossip is <i>haram,</i>

03:52.574 --> 03:54.409
and you plan on
getting married soon.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.410
Problem solved!

03:55.711 --> 03:56.712
<i>Yallah,</i> Kanafeh time!

03:57.079 --> 03:59.749
No. It's... It's more serious
than that this time.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.885
I need to be able
to talk to him in person,

04:02.919 --> 04:04.921
so I booked a flight home
tomorrow morning.

04:04.954 --> 04:05.755
Wait a second.

04:05.955 --> 04:08.456
- No. Just don't do that thing.
- What thing?

04:08.490 --> 04:09.258
That thing you do

04:09.659 --> 04:11.060
where you hijack my plan
and you turn it into yours.

04:11.093 --> 04:13.361
Please don't say
"hijack" to a Muslim.

04:13.596 --> 04:15.598
Could you not make
a joke right now, please?

04:17.499 --> 04:19.035
I don't know how many times
I have to explain it to you,

04:19.068 --> 04:20.502
but my dad is not your dad.

04:21.536 --> 04:22.738
I need you to respect that.

04:23.673 --> 04:24.674
I'm sorry.

04:24.974 --> 04:25.975
I'm sorry. You know...

04:26.309 --> 04:28.376
Humor is one of my
coping mechanisms.

04:28.410 --> 04:31.013
And there are worse fathers in
the world than yours, you know.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.722
I can't just keep saying
I'm talking to some girl,

04:39.755 --> 04:41.389
or that I'm planning
on getting married.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.492
I have to actually do something.

04:44.526 --> 04:45.527
You could come out.

04:49.031 --> 04:51.100
<i>Inshallah,</i> eventually maybe.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.534
Hmm.

04:54.904 --> 04:57.707
Or I could get married.

05:07.717 --> 05:09.051
It would just be for show.

05:10.186 --> 05:11.654
It wouldn't mean anything.

05:12.622 --> 05:13.756
It would to me.

05:16.759 --> 05:17.760
Mo...

05:18.194 --> 05:20.196
We know a lot of guys
with this kind of arrangement.

05:20.229 --> 05:21.831
But we make
fun of those guys.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.165
Well, you had to know
that something like this

05:23.199 --> 05:24.432
was bound to happen.

05:24.466 --> 05:26.035
I never thought
this would happen.

05:26.068 --> 05:27.103
This makes no sense.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.005
I mean, this isn't our plan.

05:29.404 --> 05:31.207
What are you even saying?
Do you hear yourself?

05:31.240 --> 05:32.942
I do, but I don't
know if you hear me.

05:32.975 --> 05:33.976
You can't be serious.

05:35.845 --> 05:39.916
<i>Habibi,</i> I'm not saying
I have it all figured out.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.184
I just need a little
time to go home

05:42.218 --> 05:43.185
and assess the situation.

05:43.518 --> 05:45.021
Do I get a say in any of this?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.090
I'm just asking you
to be patient with me.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.961
I wouldn't be doing this
unless I absolutely had to.

05:51.994 --> 05:52.995
You know that, right?

06:03.072 --> 06:05.007
I told you I didn't want
to talk about this now.

06:08.945 --> 06:10.179
<i>Yallah,</i> your family is waiting.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.091
All right.
Are you guys ready?

07:29.125 --> 07:30.159
Let's go!

07:30.192 --> 07:31.961
In four, three, two, one!

07:43.873 --> 07:45.341
All right, everyone,
grab a partner.

07:45.374 --> 07:46.541
Let's go!

07:49.812 --> 07:50.980
Hey! <i>Khalas,</i> I'm in a zone!

07:51.013 --> 07:52.715
Yeah, the Twilight Zone.

07:52.748 --> 07:54.250
Plus, who are you
trying to impress?

07:54.283 --> 07:55.684
I call dibs on the DJ.

07:57.186 --> 07:57.987
Switch!

07:58.287 --> 08:00.790
Not my type. Plus, I'm pretty
sure he's a minor.

08:00.823 --> 08:02.625
No one is your type these days.

08:02.658 --> 08:04.894
When you gonna snap out of this
horrible funk you've been in?

08:04.927 --> 08:06.128
It's been nearly a year.

08:06.495 --> 08:08.164
All right,
everybody. Up, up, up!

08:08.197 --> 08:10.332
Let's kick the shit
out of those fat cells.

08:10.366 --> 08:12.234
Four, three, two, one!

08:12.268 --> 08:14.036
Funk? No funk here.

08:14.070 --> 08:15.337
There are no funks given.

08:15.604 --> 08:16.505
Please don't forget
that you're speaking

08:16.839 --> 08:18.974
to your best friend here,
and not one of your patients.

08:19.008 --> 08:20.609
- I'm just worried about...
- Worried about what?

08:20.643 --> 08:21.977
I'm worried about your BV.

08:22.011 --> 08:23.746
I think maybe this is the year
you could give it up.

08:23.779 --> 08:24.814
"BV"?

08:24.847 --> 08:26.215
Butt Virginity, ya huh!

08:26.248 --> 08:28.184
Don't worry,
it's still completely intact.

08:28.217 --> 08:28.984
That's the problem.

08:29.185 --> 08:31.287
Why are you so obsessed
with my sex life?

08:31.320 --> 08:33.656
What sex? What life?

08:35.157 --> 08:36.225
All
right, everybody.

08:36.258 --> 08:37.326
Abs on the floor, let's go!

08:37.359 --> 08:38.894
Abs! Abs! Abs!

08:43.732 --> 08:45.601
Don't let last year define
who you are this year.

08:46.302 --> 08:48.637
Start new. Start fresh.

08:48.671 --> 08:49.972
You deserve it!

08:50.005 --> 08:51.307
As long you don't forget
about Wednesday.

08:51.340 --> 08:52.108
Wednesday?

08:52.341 --> 08:53.976
- The first night of Ramadan!
- My birthday!

08:54.009 --> 08:54.977
Obliques!

08:57.813 --> 08:59.215
You promised you'd
come to my party.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.916
God, where is your head lately?

09:00.950 --> 09:02.718
Sam, it's the first
night of Ramadan.

09:02.751 --> 09:03.786
- Ah ah ah ah.
- You know I like to...

09:03.819 --> 09:05.087
That's not my fault.

09:05.888 --> 09:07.957
It's my birthday,
and I'm not celebrating it

09:07.990 --> 09:09.959
without my best friend.
Allah will understand.

09:11.460 --> 09:12.728
Fine.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.729
There she is.

09:14.530 --> 09:16.799
Just don't get mad
if I leave early.

09:18.734 --> 09:19.735
I would expect nothing less.

09:24.874 --> 09:26.942
He reached out on WhatsApp.

09:26.976 --> 09:28.043
I thought you blocked him.

09:28.077 --> 09:29.712
I guess I forgot to on WhatsApp.

09:29.745 --> 09:30.980
- So?
- So, what?

09:31.013 --> 09:32.248
I blocked him on WhatsApp.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.350
Mo, maybe it's time
to talk to him.

09:34.618 --> 09:35.918
And say what?

09:36.318 --> 09:37.453
He didn't listen to me then,

09:37.486 --> 09:39.088
so why should I
listen to him now.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.823
<i>Ya</i> Allah, you are so stubborn.

09:40.856 --> 09:42.458
He's married. She's
probably pregnant,

09:42.491 --> 09:44.760
and he wants to tell me
he's naming the baby after me,

09:44.793 --> 09:45.561
which would be so weird.

09:45.995 --> 09:47.429
You literally have the most
common name in the world.

09:47.463 --> 09:48.964
it wouldn't be that weird.

09:52.168 --> 09:54.136
Yeah. Okay, <i>habibi,</i>
I'll catch up with you later.

09:54.170 --> 09:55.437
Um, hello? You're my ride.

09:56.038 --> 09:57.907
Take a Lyft or something.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.175
I have to, um...

10:00.176 --> 10:01.410
Something just came up.

10:05.247 --> 10:06.248
Unbelievable.

10:49.391 --> 10:50.392
Nurse Harper.

10:54.129 --> 10:55.898
How many lives you save today?

10:55.931 --> 10:58.300
Quit watching so much
damn <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

10:58.334 --> 10:59.435
Now, get to your patients.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.304
Info nurse's
station, Harper here.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.841
Ms. Bazzi.

11:06.875 --> 11:07.876
Hey, Doc.

11:08.077 --> 11:09.245
Hi, how are you doing today?

11:12.281 --> 11:13.949
<i>You have
reached the mailbox of...</i>

11:15.184 --> 11:17.219
<i>Hello. I cannot talk.</i>

11:17.419 --> 11:19.088
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

11:23.826 --> 11:25.461
<i>Please leave a
message after the beep.</i>

11:26.596 --> 11:29.031
<i>Hi Tata. Day one.</i>

11:29.064 --> 11:30.366
<i>Ramadan Mubarak.</i>

11:30.600 --> 11:33.202
<i>You'll be happy to know
for the first Iftar</i>

11:33.235 --> 11:34.069
<i>I'm making Fattoush</i>

11:34.436 --> 11:38.440
<i>and using exactly one-and-a half
lemons as instructed.</i>

11:38.807 --> 11:41.877
<i>Oh, this house smells so good.</i>

11:42.579 --> 11:45.114
<i>I wish you could
see these manaeesh.</i>

11:45.147 --> 11:46.482
<i>I tried your secret.</i>

11:48.317 --> 11:51.287
<i>This is always
my favorite time of the year.</i>

11:51.320 --> 11:54.290
<i>The food, the no working out,</i>

11:54.323 --> 11:56.292
<i>but it won't be the same
without you here</i>

11:56.325 --> 11:57.826
<i>or Mama and Baba.</i>

11:59.028 --> 12:00.296
<i>I'll be fine,</i> Inshallah.

12:08.237 --> 12:10.572
<i>Sam's party is tonight,</i>

12:10.607 --> 12:12.841
<i>but trust me, I'd
much rather stay in.</i>

12:12.875 --> 12:14.611
<i>I mean, I want to
be there for him,</i>

12:14.644 --> 12:15.944
<i>but, I don't know... I just...</i>

12:15.978 --> 12:17.246
<i>How many times are we gonna</i>

12:17.279 --> 12:19.515
<i>celebrate Sam's 25th birthday?</i>

12:20.015 --> 12:21.550
Hold on one second, Tata.

12:27.556 --> 12:29.925
Ah, Tata. Thank you.

12:31.260 --> 12:34.196
I'm just not in the mood
to be around happy people.

12:39.669 --> 12:41.904
If only I were a balloon.

12:42.905 --> 12:44.641
That probably made no sense.

12:44.674 --> 12:46.408
Anyway, I love you, Tata.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.310
Thank you.

13:09.998 --> 13:10.999
Ahhh!

13:12.968 --> 13:14.536
Ho-Mo!

13:14.570 --> 13:15.971
Gay-rab!

13:16.004 --> 13:17.039
You made it!

13:17.072 --> 13:18.240
Happy birthday!

13:18.273 --> 13:19.475
Best surprise party ever.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.343
Aw!

13:22.378 --> 13:24.513
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

13:24.546 --> 13:25.914
Yeah, let's go.

13:25.948 --> 13:27.916
Everyone, Mo's here!

13:27.950 --> 13:29.351
Please! You promised
not to make a scene.

13:29.385 --> 13:30.552
Oh, that's right. That's right.

13:30.587 --> 13:32.020
Never mind, Mo's not here.

13:32.054 --> 13:33.522
- Sam!
- Carry on!

13:33.555 --> 13:36.492
No more shenanigans, I promise.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.460
Here, put these in water.

13:38.494 --> 13:40.095
Thanks.

13:40.129 --> 13:41.930
I'm so glad you're here, <i>habibi.</i>

13:41.964 --> 13:43.198
Just try to have fun, okay?

13:43.666 --> 13:46.135
Oh, thank you!

13:46.669 --> 13:47.670
Here you go.

13:49.238 --> 13:50.272
Just take it.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.408
Here you go.

13:52.441 --> 13:53.509
Here we go.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.577
Bye!

13:56.679 --> 13:58.581
Is there a gospel choir here?

13:58.815 --> 14:00.683
<i>♪ Oh, yeah! ♪</i>

14:06.288 --> 14:08.056
So, I've developed

14:08.090 --> 14:09.626
a little bit of a red area
on my inner thigh.

14:09.659 --> 14:12.695
It's not quite a rash,
but it's probably not a bite either.

14:12.729 --> 14:14.029
I don't know if it's because

14:14.062 --> 14:15.531
we changed lubes
recently or what,

14:15.564 --> 14:18.167
but it's really starting
to itch and burn.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.268
Have you ever had that?

14:21.203 --> 14:22.739
Anyway, I don't know what to do,
'cause I feel it's starting

14:22.772 --> 14:25.207
to turn Andrew off, and I really
don't want him to cheat on me.

14:26.275 --> 14:27.509
It's probably herpes,

14:27.543 --> 14:29.679
and Andrew probably
gave it to you.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.182
I'm so sorry about
Andrew's herpes.

14:33.215 --> 14:34.550
Slice of cheese?

14:34.584 --> 14:36.051
Oh, my God!

14:36.653 --> 14:38.688
It is over, Andrew!

14:41.256 --> 14:43.091
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it going?

14:45.394 --> 14:47.429
I think it's time for me
to head home, <i>habibi.</i>

14:47.463 --> 14:49.465
But John hasn't come yet.
We haven't even had cake.

14:49.699 --> 14:50.733
Who's John?

14:50.934 --> 14:52.301
Settle down.

14:52.334 --> 14:54.136
He's for me, not for you.

14:54.336 --> 14:55.638
But I want you to meet him.

14:55.672 --> 14:57.206
Sam, you promised.

14:57.473 --> 14:59.208
Happy birthday!

14:59.241 --> 15:01.143
John, <i>habibi!</i>

15:01.176 --> 15:02.344
Thank you!

15:02.377 --> 15:04.747
Oh, John, this is
Mo, my best friend.

15:07.382 --> 15:08.517
Hi John. Nice to meet you.

15:08.550 --> 15:09.586
Hey buddy.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.153
And this is Kal.

15:11.186 --> 15:12.488
Val!

15:12.521 --> 15:14.423
How are you? Welcome.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.091
It's Kal, with a "K."

15:16.124 --> 15:16.893
Happy birthday!

15:17.092 --> 15:19.061
Thanks for letting me
crash your party.

15:19.094 --> 15:20.597
Of course!
The more the merrier.

15:20.630 --> 15:21.664
I don't know what this is,
but I have a feeling

15:21.698 --> 15:23.666
I'm going to put it to good use.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.468
It's a bacon-shaped dildo,
you little power bottom.

15:28.537 --> 15:30.138
- I so... I got you!
- Oh, John.

15:30.172 --> 15:31.573
Hey, Where's the kitchen?
I think I'm gonna grab a drink.

15:31.608 --> 15:33.075
Oh, uh, it... It's over there.

15:33.108 --> 15:34.644
I'll have a vodka cranberry,
if you're pouring.

15:34.677 --> 15:36.411
Sure. Uh, Kal, anything?

15:36.445 --> 15:37.647
Uh, just the usual for me.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.114
Yeah.

15:40.182 --> 15:43.385
So, Kal, tell me everything.

15:43.418 --> 15:44.553
Sam.

15:44.587 --> 15:45.655
Status, go.

15:45.688 --> 15:47.122
Single? Taken? Open? Looking?

15:47.155 --> 15:48.257
I'm single.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.391
And you're funny.

15:49.424 --> 15:51.293
You know who else
is single and funny?

15:51.326 --> 15:53.362
Mo, here, my best friend.

15:53.395 --> 15:55.798
We have been life-long friends
for our whole lives.

15:55.832 --> 15:58.166
And, he's a doctor. Did I
mention he's a single doctor?

15:58.367 --> 15:59.836
Oh, that's awesome! What kind?

15:59.869 --> 16:03.640
Oh, I'm a gastroenterologist
with a specialty in hepatology.

16:05.474 --> 16:07.376
Essentially, I fix livers.

16:07.409 --> 16:10.078
Oh perfect, this party's filled
with alcoholics.

16:12.782 --> 16:18.621
<i>♪ Happy Birthday, dear Sam</i>

16:19.121 --> 16:25.527
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

16:29.565 --> 16:30.800
Make a wish!

16:34.369 --> 16:36.538
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

16:42.612 --> 16:44.112
Say, uh, where's your bathroom?

16:44.513 --> 16:46.616
Oh, yeah, it's down the hall
to the right.

17:00.697 --> 17:02.164
- Go after him!
- To the bathroom?

17:02.197 --> 17:03.600
Oh you know what "bathroom"
is code for.

17:03.633 --> 17:04.734
Guys don't talk to me in code.

17:04.767 --> 17:05.902
Plus, I told you,
I'm not ready for any...

17:05.935 --> 17:06.703
<i>Shu</i> ready?

17:06.936 --> 17:09.371
I'm not talking soul mates,
I'm talking sex!

17:09.404 --> 17:10.707
Plus, he hasn't taken
his eyes off you all night.

17:11.506 --> 17:14.577
That's not true. Really?

17:14.844 --> 17:16.646
Round two.

17:16.679 --> 17:18.615
Hey, where'd Kal go?

17:18.648 --> 17:20.783
Oh, I... I don't know.

17:20.817 --> 17:24.286
Mo, can you go find Val
and give this to him, please?

17:24.319 --> 17:25.855
- Really?
- Yes, really.

17:25.888 --> 17:27.657
He looked thirsty.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.493
Otherwise, you're welcome
to dance with John and me.

17:31.526 --> 17:33.195
I'll go find Kal.

17:33.663 --> 17:35.832
- Oh, okay.
- Come on! Let's dance.

17:45.775 --> 17:46.776
Whoo!

18:14.771 --> 18:18.675
<i>♪ I'm peeing in
the bathroom Talking to myself</i>

18:18.708 --> 18:20.810
<i>♪ I'm peeing in
the bathroom... ♪</i>

18:20.843 --> 18:22.812
- Kal?
- Occupied.

18:22.845 --> 18:24.479
Hey, I have your drink.

18:24.681 --> 18:25.882
One second.

18:33.589 --> 18:34.590
Nice singing.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.526
Were you listening to me pee?

18:37.794 --> 18:39.494
Creep. Is that mine?

18:39.528 --> 18:40.963
No, of course not.

18:42.264 --> 18:44.701
Hey, uh,
where'd you learn Arabic anyway?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.302
Jordan. My dad was in the Army.

18:47.502 --> 18:48.671
Oh, sorry.

18:49.672 --> 18:50.707
Thanks?

18:50.907 --> 18:53.241
- Oh, whoa, whoa.
- Oops, my bad.

18:53.275 --> 18:54.944
Sorry. I don't know
why I said that. Sorry.

18:54.977 --> 18:56.478
Here, here, here.
Let me look at this.

18:58.848 --> 19:00.282
Smells like wine.

19:00.482 --> 19:01.483
You're lucky it was white.

19:02.018 --> 19:03.218
Excuse me.

19:05.387 --> 19:06.555
I'm just gonna
jump in here real quick.

19:06.923 --> 19:07.924
Cool.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.360
Cool.

19:13.562 --> 19:14.563
Cool.

19:17.033 --> 19:18.233
Cool.

19:27.542 --> 19:28.578
Can I...

19:29.045 --> 19:30.747
- You want me to just get my drink?
- Yeah.

19:31.313 --> 19:32.882
Come on in, yeah. Go ahead.

19:33.716 --> 19:34.951
- Huh?
- It's all yours.

19:34.984 --> 19:36.284
- Okay.
- Thank you.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.554
Excuse me.

19:40.656 --> 19:42.491
Right.

20:11.788 --> 20:13.589
<i>Please leave
a message after the beep.</i>

20:14.090 --> 20:17.392
Just wanted to say good night.
Sam was in rare form.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.495
From a scale of one to Sam,
he was at least a 12.

20:20.529 --> 20:21.496
Hey, creep!

20:22.031 --> 20:23.532
Are you leaving
without saying goodbye?

20:23.565 --> 20:24.767
Hey, I was just...

20:24.801 --> 20:27.502
Wait, why are you
sneaking up on me?

20:27.536 --> 20:29.571
I went out for some fresh air,

20:29.605 --> 20:31.774
and then I heard Sam dragged
everyone to Fubar.

20:31.808 --> 20:34.911
So, I guess you could say my
wing-man duties were successful.

20:38.915 --> 20:40.049
Do you want a ride home?

20:42.985 --> 20:44.654
Oh, this is just
water. I don't drink.

20:45.588 --> 20:46.589
Me either.

20:47.723 --> 20:48.925
Okay. So, shall we?

20:49.625 --> 20:50.693
Oh, no, no.

20:50.726 --> 20:52.394
The fresh air will do me good.

20:52.427 --> 20:53.696
Well, which way are you headed?

20:53.729 --> 20:54.931
I've got to stop at
the store, anyway.

20:54.964 --> 20:56.032
I'll walk with you.

20:56.065 --> 20:57.365
You don't have to do that.

20:57.399 --> 20:58.768
Plus, I don't want to know

20:58.801 --> 21:00.670
what you could possibly need
at this hour.

21:00.970 --> 21:01.971
Gum.

21:03.806 --> 21:05.808
- Gum?
- Yes, gum.

21:05.842 --> 21:06.843
I need gum.

21:08.177 --> 21:10.780
Just take a walk.
It won't take long.

21:12.181 --> 21:13.515
Unless you'd rather not.

21:15.785 --> 21:16.786
Okay.

21:19.055 --> 21:20.656
You're not going to kill me,
are you?

21:20.690 --> 21:21.757
Maybe. Depends.

21:44.013 --> 21:45.948
To be honest, I feel like
a bit of an outsider

21:45.982 --> 21:47.116
in West Hollywood.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.417
What part of town
do you live in?

21:49.785 --> 21:52.021
West Hollywood, but like,
way, way down.

21:52.655 --> 21:56.491
I get it. It probably doesn't
help that you don't drink.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.928
Probably. I've always
hated the taste. You?

21:59.461 --> 22:01.030
Oh, I don't mind the taste.

22:01.063 --> 22:03.799
I've just learned that it's best
if I steer clear.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.034
Are you in a program?

22:05.067 --> 22:06.769
Oh, my God, is that rude to ask?

22:06.802 --> 22:08.738
Totally cool if
you are, or aren't.

22:08.771 --> 22:09.705
Either way. Never mind.

22:10.172 --> 22:13.142
Wow. That was pretty forward for
someone who doesn't like Weho.

22:13.175 --> 22:15.011
Sorry. Sometimes I say
what I'm thinking.

22:15.044 --> 22:16.444
Not that I was thinking that.

22:16.478 --> 22:17.613
I didn't mean to imply that.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.547
Kal?

22:19.849 --> 22:21.050
Oh, my God!

22:21.083 --> 22:22.885
Hey, whoa.

22:22.919 --> 22:24.086
- Take it easy.
- How have you been?

22:24.120 --> 22:25.988
I haven't seen you out in,
like, a minute.

22:26.022 --> 22:27.690
You're coming to
my reading, right?

22:27.723 --> 22:28.925
Maybe.

22:28.958 --> 22:30.525
Uh, guys, this is Mo.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.526
Hey, guys.

22:31.861 --> 22:32.929
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:32.962 --> 22:34.096
So, where are you headed?

22:34.130 --> 22:35.665
We're heading
to Fubar. Come!

22:35.698 --> 22:36.732
Oh, my God, yes, come!

22:36.766 --> 22:37.733
I love Fubar.

22:39.835 --> 22:40.903
Oh, me too!

22:40.937 --> 22:42.772
There is nowhere I'd rather be.

22:43.673 --> 22:44.472
Okay, girl.

22:44.707 --> 22:47.442
Well, you know,
we'll see you there I guess.

22:47.843 --> 22:49.612
You should've slept with him
when you had the chance.

22:49.645 --> 22:51.614
- Who said I didn't?
- He didn't.

22:54.216 --> 22:55.718
Friends of yours?

22:56.352 --> 22:59.588
Uh, sometimes this town
feels way too small.

22:59.622 --> 23:01.023
Hmm. They actors?

23:01.223 --> 23:02.858
Yeah, how could you tell?

23:02.892 --> 23:03.993
They made me uncomfortable.

23:04.026 --> 23:06.228
Actors always make
me uncomfortable.

23:06.262 --> 23:08.197
- Hey, I'm an actor.
- Like I said...

23:08.397 --> 23:10.166
I'm just kidding.

23:10.199 --> 23:11.600
Whatever, creep!

23:11.634 --> 23:12.668
Whatever, girl!

23:12.702 --> 23:13.903
- Don't.
- You don't.

23:13.936 --> 23:14.937
Deal.

23:18.040 --> 23:21.043
I bet you charm all the boys
with trips to buy gum.

23:21.077 --> 23:22.611
Nah, just the cute ones.

23:22.912 --> 23:23.913
Flirt.

23:24.246 --> 23:25.948
Like, that was flirting, right?

23:28.150 --> 23:30.552
Now, this place,
Thursday nights,

23:30.586 --> 23:32.188
even sober, that's a party.

23:32.221 --> 23:33.521
Oh, God, I could never.

23:33.555 --> 23:35.791
- What? Go out on a Thursday?
- Exactly.

23:35.825 --> 23:38.060
No, I reserve my singing
for the shower only.

23:38.094 --> 23:39.128
Audience of me.

23:39.161 --> 23:40.863
Oh, you should try it. It's fun.

23:40.896 --> 23:42.832
Life is so easy
for guys like you.

23:42.865 --> 23:44.200
Guys like me?

23:44.233 --> 23:45.701
You know, the arms, the height,

23:45.735 --> 23:48.270
the endless options
of well-worn tank tops.

23:48.304 --> 23:50.840
- Mega attractive guys have more...
- I hate tank tops.

23:50.873 --> 23:52.174
Well, you know what I mean.

23:52.208 --> 23:55.177
What I know is that a gay,
Arab, Muslim guy in Weho

23:55.211 --> 23:56.912
probably knows what it's like
to have people

23:56.946 --> 23:58.180
make assumptions about him.

23:58.414 --> 24:00.883
They're generally incorrect,
and they never feel good.

24:01.784 --> 24:04.653
You know, I have to work much
harder to be taken seriously.

24:06.989 --> 24:09.658
But it's nice to know you think
I'm mega attractive.

24:09.692 --> 24:11.559
- What?
- That's what you said, right?

24:11.594 --> 24:12.560
Oh, here we are.

24:14.096 --> 24:15.264
I think it's gonna rain.

24:15.297 --> 24:16.766
We should grab an umbrella.

24:16.799 --> 24:17.900
Okay. Come on.

24:23.906 --> 24:25.741
So, is Mo short for Mohammed?

24:25.775 --> 24:26.541
It is.

24:26.876 --> 24:30.146
Is Kal short for...
Wait, what is Kal short for?

24:30.379 --> 24:31.580
Kal-El.

24:31.781 --> 24:32.848
Khalil?

24:32.882 --> 24:34.683
No. Kal-El.

24:36.218 --> 24:38.287
Your full name is Kal-El?

24:38.320 --> 24:40.322
- Like Superman?
- Yes.

24:40.356 --> 24:42.124
Like Superman's Kryptonian name

24:42.158 --> 24:44.126
given to him
by his biological parents,

24:44.160 --> 24:45.694
Jor-El and Lara?

24:45.728 --> 24:46.762
Oh, Superman fan?

24:46.796 --> 24:47.797
Yeah! Huge!

24:48.097 --> 24:48.898
Do you have a favorite?

24:49.098 --> 24:51.333
Superman? Oh, Christopher Reeve,
no contest.

24:51.367 --> 24:52.334
Agreed.

24:52.635 --> 24:54.737
I can never decide
which movie I like more,

24:54.770 --> 24:55.805
the first movie or the second.

24:55.838 --> 24:56.772
Oh, definitely the first,

24:56.972 --> 24:59.241
but the battle scene at the end
of the second is epic.

24:59.275 --> 25:01.143
Epic, totally!

25:01.177 --> 25:03.279
Favorite scene?
Wait, let me guess.

25:04.747 --> 25:06.615
"Easy Miss, I've got you."

25:06.649 --> 25:09.819
"You... You've got me?
Who's got you?"

25:11.187 --> 25:13.622
I think I just found
my dad's soulmate.

25:14.890 --> 25:17.026
How did you know
that was my favorite part?

25:17.059 --> 25:18.260
Isn't it everyone's?

25:19.061 --> 25:21.330
- This is my favorite part.
- Huh?

25:22.698 --> 25:23.732
Fro-yo.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.334
Oh, yeah.

25:26.368 --> 25:27.603
Me too.

25:28.270 --> 25:30.172
- All right.
- It's pouring out there.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.976
Sam seriously calls it BV?

25:34.009 --> 25:34.977
Mmm-hmm.

25:35.579 --> 25:39.014
Can I ask you what it is
you're holding onto?

25:39.048 --> 25:41.417
Is it like a "never gonna
happen" type thing,

25:41.450 --> 25:43.018
or a Muslim thing?

25:43.052 --> 25:45.354
Oh, no. It has nothing to do
with any of that.

25:45.788 --> 25:48.357
I mean, the truth is,
I don't even know if I want to.

25:49.091 --> 25:51.961
I mean, but if I do, I want it
to be with someone special.

25:52.628 --> 25:54.830
And you haven't found
someone special yet?

25:55.798 --> 25:56.799
No.

25:58.968 --> 26:02.238
It must be hard to find another
good Muslim guy in this town.

26:02.271 --> 26:03.339
I think that's admirable.

26:03.372 --> 26:04.373
What do you mean?

26:04.940 --> 26:07.376
Well, you seem
pretty Muslim, right?

26:07.409 --> 26:08.444
Like you practice?

26:08.477 --> 26:09.645
<i>Hamdiallah,</i> I try.

26:10.713 --> 26:12.648
That's really cool and rare.

26:13.215 --> 26:15.084
I mean, honestly, most people
are turned off

26:15.117 --> 26:16.152
by the whole thing.

26:16.852 --> 26:19.822
Explaining my faith to people
is kinda hard.

26:20.189 --> 26:21.023
I bet.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.859
I bet most Muslims
would shun you for being gay,

26:23.893 --> 26:26.795
and most gays don't really
get down with God.

26:27.396 --> 26:30.199
But you've found a way
to reconcile the two?

26:34.737 --> 26:37.006
Have you ever seen
<i>The Sound of Music?</i>

26:37.873 --> 26:39.208
The movie?

26:39.441 --> 26:41.177
Are you avoiding my question?

26:41.210 --> 26:42.378
Hear me out.

26:42.411 --> 26:44.380
You know when Maria returns
to the convent,

26:44.413 --> 26:47.149
and tells Mother Abbess
that she can't love the Captain

26:47.183 --> 26:50.052
because she's made a vow to God?

26:50.085 --> 26:52.054
Yes, I remember that part.

26:52.087 --> 26:54.423
Well, do you remember what
Mother Abbess says to her?

26:54.456 --> 26:56.425
To climb every mountain?

26:56.458 --> 26:59.929
Well, yes. But
before that she says,

27:01.864 --> 27:03.832
"If you love this man,

27:03.866 --> 27:05.234
"it doesn't mean
you love God less."

27:06.268 --> 27:08.771
I was born gay and I love God.

27:09.171 --> 27:12.308
The two can and should totally
be able to coexist.

27:14.210 --> 27:15.211
Hmm.

27:16.078 --> 27:18.414
You realize how gay you
sound right now, right?

27:18.447 --> 27:20.015
Hey, come on.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.895
Kal! Oh, my God!

27:33.095 --> 27:34.196
So glad you're here.

27:34.230 --> 27:36.232
Okay, first of all.
You're singing...

27:36.265 --> 27:37.233
Kal. Hey...

27:39.501 --> 27:40.869
Oh, my God.

27:50.212 --> 27:51.247
Go on in.

27:57.453 --> 27:59.421
<i>Hello. I cannot talk.</i>

27:59.822 --> 28:01.290
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

28:05.894 --> 28:07.529
<i>Please leave
a message after the beep.</i>

28:08.530 --> 28:10.899
Hey, Tata. Headed home now.

28:10.933 --> 28:12.234
Didn't expect to
be out this late

28:12.268 --> 28:14.036
on the first night of Ramadan.

28:40.029 --> 28:41.397
- Can I borrow some ketchup?
- Huh?

28:41.430 --> 28:43.232
I tell those queens,
"Extra ketchup,"

28:43.265 --> 28:45.401
and they always say, "Okay, boo,
whatever you want,"

28:45.434 --> 28:47.403
like they're my best friend,
and what happens

28:47.436 --> 28:48.537
when I reach into the bag?

28:48.570 --> 28:50.205
- No ketchup.
- No ketchup!

28:50.239 --> 28:52.074
They're toying with me,
but they'll see.

28:52.107 --> 28:53.309
Ugh! You want some?

28:53.542 --> 28:54.611
- Fasting.
- Yeah me too.

28:54.644 --> 28:56.111
These are just fries though.

28:59.048 --> 29:00.382
How are you up this early?

29:00.750 --> 29:02.284
I haven't gone to bed yet.

29:03.085 --> 29:05.821
- Well?
- Well what?

29:06.455 --> 29:08.490
You have nothing to say?

29:08.792 --> 29:10.326
Nothing happened.

29:10.526 --> 29:12.061
Yes, it did.

29:12.294 --> 29:13.329
No, it didn't.

29:13.630 --> 29:15.364
How do you know?
You weren't even there.

29:15.397 --> 29:16.999
That makes no sense.
Of course I was.

29:17.032 --> 29:18.467
We walked around all
of West Hollywood

29:18.500 --> 29:19.602
for most of the night.

29:20.502 --> 29:22.137
- Who?
- Me and Kal.

29:22.171 --> 29:23.238
You and Kal?

29:23.272 --> 29:24.473
Yeah, who'd you think?

29:24.506 --> 29:25.307
I was talking about John.

29:25.507 --> 29:27.276
John? I barely said
two words to the guy.

29:27.309 --> 29:28.911
Not you and John.
Me and John.

29:28.944 --> 29:31.213
Oh, what happened?
Keep it macro please.

29:31.246 --> 29:32.548
I don't need details.

29:32.582 --> 29:34.283
No, no, no.
Forget me and John.

29:34.316 --> 29:36.518
I want details.
Juicy, dirty details.

29:36.552 --> 29:38.120
Don't make me pull teeth.

29:38.153 --> 29:39.321
Nothing happened.

29:39.355 --> 29:40.623
I walked him to buy some gum.

29:40.657 --> 29:43.025
Gum. That's what
you're calling it?

29:45.394 --> 29:46.995
He went into Fubar. That's it.

29:47.196 --> 29:48.097
Didn't you see him there?

29:48.464 --> 29:50.199
<i>Sharmout,</i> my mother
could've been dancing on a pole

29:50.232 --> 29:51.266
and I wouldn't have seen her.

29:51.300 --> 29:52.901
- So, nothing? No kiss?
- No.

29:52.935 --> 29:54.069
- No phone number?
- No.

29:54.103 --> 29:55.270
No plan to hang out again?

29:55.304 --> 29:56.572
Sam, I told you everything.

29:56.606 --> 29:58.374
We chewed gum and ate yogurt.

29:58.407 --> 30:00.175
Okay.

30:00.810 --> 30:03.412
Not every hot guy
is just looking for sex, Sam.

30:03.646 --> 30:06.014
You make assumptions,
but it's hard for guys like Kal

30:06.048 --> 30:07.282
to be taken seriously sometimes.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.352
I hear you. Nothing happened.

30:10.653 --> 30:13.389
We talked about Superman.
We had fro-yo.

30:13.422 --> 30:16.225
Let's leave it at that and not jinx
this thing that isn't even a thing.

30:16.726 --> 30:18.595
- So you are interested!
- I'm not saying that.

30:18.628 --> 30:20.462
But you're not not saying that.
So, there's hope!

30:22.131 --> 30:24.900
I told you there was
life after Hassan.

30:25.100 --> 30:27.336
- Oh, sorry.
- Not this again.

30:27.369 --> 30:29.171
Mo, it's been a year.

30:29.204 --> 30:30.707
And God knows,
you're not getting any younger.

30:30.740 --> 30:32.642
- Sam, please.
- That's it.

30:32.908 --> 30:34.611
I'm getting Val's phone number
from John.

30:34.644 --> 30:36.145
I need an excuse
to text him anyway.

30:36.178 --> 30:38.514
His name is Kal. With a "K."
And don't you dare!

30:38.547 --> 30:40.282
Don't ever tell me
"Don't" Mohammed!

30:41.618 --> 30:42.685
"Everybody
says don't, everybody says..."

30:42.719 --> 30:43.919
Don't.

30:44.687 --> 30:47.489
Okay, now my turn.

30:47.523 --> 30:48.991
Pure thoughts only. I'm fasting.

30:49.024 --> 30:50.559
But these are pure.

30:50.593 --> 30:52.294
Purely <i>haram.</i>

30:52.327 --> 30:53.730
Anyway, we were
both pretty drunk,

30:53.763 --> 30:55.464
- but I have the poppers...
- I don't want to know.

30:55.497 --> 30:57.099
Prude.

30:58.635 --> 31:00.102
<i>Yallah,</i> I have to head to the
hospital soon, I have a consult.

31:00.670 --> 31:01.937
Oh, it's fine.

31:02.171 --> 31:04.106
I gotta go meet the boys
for Sunday Funday.

31:04.139 --> 31:05.374
It's Thursday.

31:06.308 --> 31:08.177
It's Weho.

31:19.021 --> 31:20.690
- Megan? Hey.
- Mohammed?

31:30.232 --> 31:31.333
Hi, Mom.

31:38.407 --> 31:39.609
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom. We got it.

31:39.642 --> 31:40.643
Okay. Thank you.

31:42.311 --> 31:43.312
Just heading to work.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.216
The driver is a woman.
Mama, why are you so amped up?

31:47.249 --> 31:48.217
Are you hangry?

32:02.531 --> 32:04.166
Let him watch in peace.

32:04.533 --> 32:05.802
Say hi.

32:05.835 --> 32:07.637
I'm glad he's not fasting,
he needs his medicine.

32:21.618 --> 32:23.218
I'll see you soon
enough, <i>Inshallah.</i>

32:29.792 --> 32:31.360
<i>Of course, every day.</i>

32:32.427 --> 32:34.363
Guess who reached out this week?

32:35.197 --> 32:35.999
Hassan.

32:36.331 --> 32:38.635
After a whole year,
he's still trying to contact me.

32:39.669 --> 32:42.104
Mama, don't talk like that!
You will break your fast.

32:47.309 --> 32:48.410
Oh, I didn't.

32:48.443 --> 32:49.746
He is now blocked from all apps.

33:04.159 --> 33:07.262
Mom, you have two grandkids,
and a third is on the way.

33:07.296 --> 33:10.767
<i>Plus, I'm sure Allah has greater
issues to deal with than my love life.</i>

33:21.778 --> 33:24.112
Okay, Mom.
I can't even deal with A, your racism,

33:24.146 --> 33:26.515
and B, with how you think me
and my future husband,

33:26.548 --> 33:28.150
sent by God because
of your prayers,

33:28.183 --> 33:30.285
are going to have
full-blooded Arab babies?

33:33.723 --> 33:36.425
Okay, Mom, I just got to work.
I will call you later.

33:40.529 --> 33:41.563
<i>Mom, I gotta go.</i>

33:44.767 --> 33:46.703
Mama, he's not depressed.
You're just bored.

33:46.736 --> 33:47.804
<i>Yallah,</i> bye.

33:47.837 --> 33:49.571
Oh, bye.

34:53.970 --> 34:56.304
Oh, just my mom.

35:08.718 --> 35:11.286
Mo? Hey.

35:11.553 --> 35:13.723
Oh, my God, hey.
What are you doing here?

35:14.189 --> 35:16.959
Did Sam reach out to you?
I told him not to.

35:17.359 --> 35:18.828
I work here.

35:19.062 --> 35:20.697
Uh, Sam should have never...

35:20.730 --> 35:21.998
Oh, right, doctor.

35:22.031 --> 35:22.999
Right, right.

35:23.432 --> 35:26.568
Um, no, I was just thinking what
a weird coincidence this is.

35:26.602 --> 35:27.670
Totally.

35:27.704 --> 35:28.871
But what are you doing here?

35:28.905 --> 35:30.539
I was just visiting someone.

35:30.773 --> 35:31.874
Really?

35:31.908 --> 35:33.475
Everything okay?

35:33.810 --> 35:35.778
No, yeah. Everything's fine.

35:35.812 --> 35:37.780
It's an overdue visit.
Nothing major.

35:38.047 --> 35:39.247
Excuse me.

35:44.887 --> 35:47.522
So, uh, why did you
ditch me last night?

35:47.556 --> 35:49.357
Ditch you? You went inside.

35:49.592 --> 35:53.328
Momentarily, yes, but I came back
out to get you, you were gone.

35:53.361 --> 35:54.329
You did?

35:58.500 --> 35:59.602
Uh, where you headed?

35:59.969 --> 36:01.871
Um, ordering a ride.

36:01.904 --> 36:04.439
I can see that.
I mean, where?

36:04.473 --> 36:06.274
I'm headed to the grocery.

36:06.308 --> 36:09.912
Well, let me give you a ride to
make it up to you for last night.

36:09.946 --> 36:11.279
I feel bad that
you think I would ditch you.

36:13.049 --> 36:14.416
After you.

36:15.517 --> 36:17.687
- Um, okay.
- Go ahead.

36:19.421 --> 36:21.023
Just out to the
parking lot there.

36:40.542 --> 36:41.844
Your mother doesn't mind?

36:41.878 --> 36:43.713
No, it's not
that big of a deal to her.

36:43.746 --> 36:45.413
You mean to tell me
your immigrant mother

36:45.447 --> 36:48.383
would allow you to be like this
and have no opinion about it?

36:48.416 --> 36:51.854
My immigrant mother is nothing
like what you see on TV.

36:51.888 --> 36:53.589
She is not some stereotype.

36:53.623 --> 36:55.758
I'm sorry, this is just
so hard for me to swallow.

36:55.792 --> 36:58.060
Like, stems on and everything?

36:58.094 --> 37:00.428
Yeah. We kinda likes the stems
in my family.

37:00.897 --> 37:03.099
You kinda like the stems?

37:03.132 --> 37:04.634
This is blasphemy.

37:04.667 --> 37:06.068
Is it though?

37:06.102 --> 37:07.536
Okay. Step away
from the parsley.

37:07.569 --> 37:09.038
No tabbouleh of mine
will have stems in it.

37:09.772 --> 37:11.373
Of yours?

37:11.607 --> 37:14.644
- Are you making my tabbouleh now?
- In fact, I am.

37:14.677 --> 37:18.014
Mainly so we don't choke to
death on any of the stems

37:18.047 --> 37:19.682
that you seem to think
are not a big deal

37:19.715 --> 37:21.584
when making a delicate dish
like tabbouleh.

37:21.617 --> 37:22.685
Let's back up.

37:22.952 --> 37:24.519
Not only are you
making the tabbouleh,

37:24.553 --> 37:26.823
but you're also joining me
in eating it?

37:26.856 --> 37:29.692
Did you just invite yourself
to break fast with me?

37:29.892 --> 37:31.894
My mom used to say
that those who fast

37:31.928 --> 37:35.430
should not have to cook,
or, well, eat alone.

37:35.463 --> 37:37.365
So, yeah, I guess I did.

37:37.399 --> 37:39.969
Is she the one who taught you
to make stem-less tabbouleh?

37:40.002 --> 37:44.640
Uh, no. No. She just burned
toast most of my life.

37:45.473 --> 37:47.643
In Jordan she was afraid
to let me leave the compound,

37:47.677 --> 37:50.580
so I spent a lot of time
watching the cooks prepare meals.

37:50.613 --> 37:51.647
What was she afraid of?

37:51.848 --> 37:54.416
You were on an army compound,
probably the safest place

37:54.449 --> 37:56.384
in the whole country.

37:56.418 --> 37:57.920
Not for a gay kid it wasn't.

37:58.721 --> 38:00.823
Oh, right.

38:01.958 --> 38:03.558
With the way those
ladies cooked,

38:03.593 --> 38:05.560
you could taste the love
in every bite.

38:05.595 --> 38:08.598
Oh, that's how I often describe
my grandmother's cooking.

38:09.165 --> 38:11.868
You must miss your family
during this month.

38:11.901 --> 38:12.869
I do.

38:13.202 --> 38:15.972
Every year we all get together
at my place for the last night.

38:16.239 --> 38:19.041
I remember it being such an
important time in the Middle East.

38:19.441 --> 38:21.878
Did you like living there?

38:21.911 --> 38:24.881
In Jordan?
Um, yeah, for the most part.

38:24.914 --> 38:27.884
It was hard on my mom,
so my parents fought a lot.

38:27.917 --> 38:29.852
My dad could be a real asshole.

38:29.886 --> 38:31.654
Really? I'm sorry.

38:32.121 --> 38:34.056
I'm sure he was
just doing his best.

38:34.924 --> 38:37.159
I'm sure he thought so.

38:37.760 --> 38:38.995
I'm sorry.

38:39.028 --> 38:41.496
I have this thing with parents
and reverence.

38:42.031 --> 38:45.101
The Qu'ran says,
"Say not to them a word of contempt,

38:45.134 --> 38:48.104
"nor repel them, but address
them in terms of honor."

38:50.806 --> 38:52.440
Right.

38:54.076 --> 38:56.612
Well, shall we?

39:13.029 --> 39:14.562
Wow! Nice place you have here.

39:14.997 --> 39:16.198
Thanks.

39:16.232 --> 39:19.735
Yes, uh, we can just set these
down right here.

39:21.671 --> 39:24.740
Can I get you something?
Coffee? Tea? Water?

39:28.644 --> 39:31.013
- Oh.
- No, I'm fine thanks.

39:31.781 --> 39:34.650
Is it cool if I pray?
I'll only be a few minutes.

39:35.184 --> 39:37.519
Oh, sure, yeah. I'll put these
away and start prepping.

39:37.552 --> 39:38.587
Thanks.

39:38.621 --> 39:39.789
Could I, uh, use your bathroom?

39:39.822 --> 39:40.890
Sure.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.758
Uh, it's just that
way on the right.

39:42.792 --> 39:44.526
Thanks.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.710
This will be, like, the third
time this casting director

40:00.743 --> 40:03.980
has brought me in,
and I really want this part.

40:05.614 --> 40:07.917
I have a Ninja
chopper, you know.

40:07.950 --> 40:09.118
Oh, no way, man!

40:09.151 --> 40:10.853
You gotta chop the leaves
with a knife!

40:11.287 --> 40:13.856
Okay. But Iftar is in one hour.

40:17.259 --> 40:19.128
What's the play?

40:19.161 --> 40:20.863
Oh, no, it's not a play.

40:20.896 --> 40:23.666
It's a guest star role
on a new courtroom drama.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.768
Five-episode arc, recurring.

40:25.801 --> 40:28.971
My manager thinks I've got
a good shot at it.

40:31.774 --> 40:33.575
I don't think I could do it.

40:34.010 --> 40:36.746
- What?
- Auditions.

40:36.779 --> 40:40.649
I mean, standing there
in front of people,

40:40.683 --> 40:42.618
waiting for them
to tell me if I'm good enough.

40:43.686 --> 40:45.321
Yeah, it can be pretty grueling.

40:45.354 --> 40:48.124
I mean, how do you believe that
you are good enough

40:48.157 --> 40:51.794
when you're constantly being
told that you're not?

40:51.827 --> 40:54.063
Well, I'm not constantly
being told I'm not.

40:54.096 --> 40:56.232
I mean, there are some wins
here and there.

40:56.265 --> 40:57.600
Oh, my God, of course.

40:57.633 --> 40:59.268
Uh, what's wrong with me!

40:59.301 --> 41:02.772
I mean, it can be tough, but you
can't live your life in fear, right?

41:04.940 --> 41:06.809
Right now I'm afraid
you're gonna cut your finger?

41:06.842 --> 41:08.110
Oh, I got it. I got it.

41:08.144 --> 41:10.046
I told you I got it.

41:11.614 --> 41:13.182
I got back to the car,
and I noticed there was

41:13.215 --> 41:15.317
toilet paper sticking on... Yeah.

41:15.351 --> 41:17.086
It was not my best day.

41:17.119 --> 41:20.890
- What? Oh, my God. Wow.
- So, it's not...

41:20.923 --> 41:22.591
Have you ever thought of
what you would do

41:22.625 --> 41:24.126
if this acting thing
doesn't work out?

41:24.493 --> 41:26.929
Porn. Oh, God.

41:26.962 --> 41:28.831
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:28.864 --> 41:31.333
I just, uh, I hate
that question.

41:31.901 --> 41:33.936
I'm sorry.
I can't seem to stay dry around you.

41:33.969 --> 41:34.737
Oh, really?

41:35.204 --> 41:37.206
And that was a dumb question.
You don't have to answer.

41:37.239 --> 41:39.341
Oh, no. It's no dumber than
asking me if I'm in a program.

41:40.910 --> 41:42.778
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

41:44.213 --> 41:47.883
For me,
there's no other options really.

41:48.350 --> 41:51.153
I think I credit my mom
with my acting ambitions.

41:52.021 --> 41:53.722
Your mom?

41:53.756 --> 41:55.324
Yeah. I...

41:55.858 --> 41:59.795
I used to put on these little
skits to try and cheer her up.

42:00.863 --> 42:06.168
She used to say I was the only
person who could make her smile,

42:06.202 --> 42:08.337
and I loved that.

42:08.604 --> 42:12.775
Even now,
I feel like I owe it to her,

42:12.808 --> 42:17.313
like, if I stop,
she'll stop smiling or something.

42:21.016 --> 42:25.054
Uh, plus she told me I was good at
it, so, I mean, I...

42:26.856 --> 42:29.658
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

42:29.692 --> 42:32.962
Um, that's just really sweet.

42:33.162 --> 42:34.763
Yeah, see? I'm not
such a mystery.

42:38.067 --> 42:39.702
- Ah...
- No, no, no.

42:39.735 --> 42:41.070
No, sit. Sit.

42:41.303 --> 42:43.973
So, why did you become a doctor?

42:44.006 --> 42:46.108
Talk about dumb questions.
Hello, I'm Arab.

42:46.142 --> 42:47.042
Oh, come on!

42:47.376 --> 42:49.278
We just met, but I think I can
tell there's a good reason

42:49.311 --> 42:51.013
behind every choice you make.

42:52.381 --> 42:55.885
I owe it all to my tata,
my grandmother.

42:55.918 --> 42:57.219
Was she a doctor?

42:57.419 --> 42:58.854
No.

43:00.289 --> 43:02.791
Patient. Sort of.

43:02.825 --> 43:04.193
Say more.

43:05.928 --> 43:10.399
I was like 10 or 11
when it happened.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.769
She nearly died.

43:13.802 --> 43:16.205
We were at the movies
sharing some popcorn,

43:16.238 --> 43:19.842
and I looked over,
and she was blue.

43:20.409 --> 43:22.311
I froze.

43:23.145 --> 43:27.416
Then out of nowhere, this man,
this giant, hulk of a man,

43:27.449 --> 43:30.686
just swooped in,
and dislodged the popcorn.

43:31.020 --> 43:34.256
He saved her, and she never
stopped thanking God for him.

43:35.357 --> 43:38.460
I wanted to do that,
to save people,

43:39.762 --> 43:41.463
to be Superman in real life.

43:42.531 --> 43:44.166
And now you are.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.901
Hardly.

43:45.935 --> 43:49.405
Is your tata your mom's mom?
Or your dad's mom?

43:49.438 --> 43:50.406
My mom's mom.

43:51.073 --> 43:52.942
And you still talk every day?

43:53.876 --> 43:56.445
Yup. Today, we spoke twice.

44:13.362 --> 44:16.398
Thanks again for dinner.
It was really delicious.

44:16.799 --> 44:18.200
My pleasure.

44:18.234 --> 44:19.935
Text me some other
dishes you like.

44:19.969 --> 44:21.170
Oh, no, no.
You don't have to.

44:21.203 --> 44:22.404
I want to.

44:22.438 --> 44:24.006
This was fun.

44:24.039 --> 44:27.176
And cooking reminds me of home.

44:36.418 --> 44:38.787
So, I actually have
a lot of lines to learn

44:38.821 --> 44:39.989
for tomorrow.

44:40.022 --> 44:41.857
Oh, you should get going then.

44:41.890 --> 44:43.192
Let me put this in a to-go cup.

44:43.993 --> 44:46.962
Or I could stay?

44:46.996 --> 44:49.398
You're not too
tired yet, are you?

44:50.966 --> 44:52.301
"I love you."

44:53.869 --> 44:55.971
"Don't do that.
Don't tell me you love me."

44:56.772 --> 44:59.575
Pause. David turns
to leave and stops yet again.

44:59.609 --> 45:02.144
Oh, no. No. You don't read
the directions and the actions.

45:02.177 --> 45:03.946
- You just say the lines.
- Oh, sorry.

45:04.246 --> 45:05.414
Again?

45:05.447 --> 45:07.082
No, no, no. We'll
just go from here.

45:08.884 --> 45:12.388
Um, "I might not know,
but after meeting you,

45:12.421 --> 45:15.124
"I don't think anyone
will ever compare."

45:20.062 --> 45:21.530
It's your line.

45:21.563 --> 45:22.965
Oh. Oh, sorry.

45:22.998 --> 45:24.500
Um, you're good.

45:24.533 --> 45:25.901
Oh, thank you.

45:25.934 --> 45:29.438
Um, "Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me.

45:29.471 --> 45:31.940
"It's my body and my choices."

45:31.974 --> 45:33.275
Who wrote this crap?

45:33.309 --> 45:34.209
Hey!

45:34.543 --> 45:37.446
This crap is going pay my bills
for the rest of the year.

45:37.681 --> 45:39.381
And I thought Muslims
weren't supposed to judge.

45:39.415 --> 45:40.583
Oh, I'm not judging.

45:40.617 --> 45:43.252
I'm just, um, okay,
I guess I am judging.

45:43.285 --> 45:44.587
God forgive me.

45:44.887 --> 45:46.955
Okay. Let's try it
with some blocking.

45:47.189 --> 45:49.391
Sure. What's that?

45:49.759 --> 45:52.895
Um, so, I'm gonna
go to grab you...

45:52.928 --> 45:55.164
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...and then you say your line.

45:55.197 --> 45:56.832
Oh, okay.

45:59.669 --> 46:00.936
Go.

46:01.370 --> 46:03.872
"Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me.

46:03.906 --> 46:07.076
"It's my body and my choices!"

46:13.616 --> 46:15.351
You're a natural!

46:15.384 --> 46:16.919
That was so...

47:29.592 --> 47:31.560
They both premiered in 1957,

47:31.594 --> 47:33.362
but can you believe
that <i>The Music Man</i>

47:33.395 --> 47:36.331
won the Tony Award for best
musical over <i>West Side Story?</i>

47:36.365 --> 47:37.199
Uh huh...

47:37.600 --> 47:40.035
Yeah, with everything going on
in the world at that time,

47:40.068 --> 47:41.704
people were more sympathetic
to a white salesman

47:41.738 --> 47:43.372
conning a small town
than a community

47:43.405 --> 47:46.275
of Puerto Ricans
being shot and stabbed.

47:46.308 --> 47:48.143
America, am I right?

47:48.177 --> 47:50.412
Yeah, you usually are.

47:51.413 --> 47:52.615
Uh...

47:52.649 --> 47:54.349
Sorry, I...

47:54.383 --> 47:57.152
No, I'm sorry. I
just can't right now.

47:57.453 --> 47:59.689
You were talking so passionately
about Tony and Maria.

47:59.722 --> 48:00.757
I just thought...

48:00.790 --> 48:02.659
Please don't
misunderstand, you know.

48:02.692 --> 48:04.226
The sun is up. Ramadan.

48:04.259 --> 48:05.427
Oh, right!

48:05.461 --> 48:07.296
Right. I guess I'll
just have to wait for

48:07.329 --> 48:09.331
- "Tonight, tonight."
- Please, don't. Please.

48:09.899 --> 48:12.534
Even a single impure thought
will ruin this whole day's fast.

48:12.568 --> 48:15.070
That's right. I forget that it's
not about abstaining

48:15.103 --> 48:16.371
just from food or water.

48:16.405 --> 48:17.473
Right.

48:17.506 --> 48:19.107
It's about abstaining
from everything.

48:19.408 --> 48:21.043
You're so disciplined.

48:21.076 --> 48:22.679
I hope that extends
into the bedroom.

48:22.712 --> 48:24.413
Oh, well, there goes the day.

48:24.446 --> 48:26.515
Oh, no. It's not your fault.

48:26.548 --> 48:27.750
I was just kidding!

48:28.083 --> 48:30.319
Sex is the furthest thing
from my mind right now.

48:30.352 --> 48:32.254
Mmm. I'll just
explain that to Allah.

48:32.287 --> 48:33.355
Just think of kittens.

48:34.189 --> 48:35.491
Old ladies.

48:35.524 --> 48:36.759
Vaginas.

48:36.793 --> 48:38.728
Old lady vaginas.

48:38.761 --> 48:41.196
Kittens and old ladies?

48:41.230 --> 48:43.065
Is that how you
distract yourself?

48:43.098 --> 48:45.167
How do you distract yourself?

49:03.218 --> 49:04.186
I can't believe you
wore that shirt.

49:04.654 --> 49:06.656
I can't believe I'm missing beach
volleyball with John for this.

49:06.689 --> 49:08.357
- This is horrible timing.
- <i>Staghfallah.</i>

49:08.390 --> 49:09.224
Don't get preachy.

49:09.859 --> 49:11.828
It's not my fault the body has to
be in the ground within 24 hours.

49:11.861 --> 49:13.328
Sam! There will be
more beach volleyball.

49:13.362 --> 49:15.163
Your uncle only dies once.

49:15.197 --> 49:16.431
He's not even my uncle.

49:16.465 --> 49:17.734
I thought you said
your aunt's husband.

49:17.767 --> 49:19.368
- Not really my aunt.
- Got it.

49:23.505 --> 49:25.340
You say that
to each man in the line-up.

49:25.374 --> 49:26.676
Are you really trying
to teach me Arabic?

49:26.709 --> 49:28.110
Which one of us is
the immigrant here?

49:28.143 --> 49:29.545
I know, but we have to respect
the customs.

49:29.579 --> 49:31.380
Step down from your
pulpit, <i>habibi.</i>

49:31.413 --> 49:33.248
This isn't my first rodeo.

49:33.282 --> 49:35.417
Oh, there's my cousin Muna.

49:35.450 --> 49:37.620
Isn't she a beauty queen with
all that forehead on display?

49:37.654 --> 49:38.855
Let's go say hi.

49:38.888 --> 49:40.623
No! You cannot go
to the women's side, Sam.

49:40.657 --> 49:42.524
Why not? I want to say hi
to my cousin.

49:42.558 --> 49:44.459
- It's rude.
- What year are we in here?

49:44.727 --> 49:46.094
Get out of the dark ages.

49:46.128 --> 49:47.563
You can go after
the Sheikh speaks.

49:47.597 --> 49:49.364
And I can't believe
you wore that shirt.

49:49.398 --> 49:51.266
It's the only black I had.

49:51.300 --> 49:52.735
Black isn't a good color on me.

50:31.808 --> 50:34.309
Well, then he, like,
wouldn't talk to his dad

50:34.343 --> 50:36.411
or his dad wouldn't talk to him.
I don't even know.

50:36.445 --> 50:37.580
There's so much drama,
I can't even remember,

50:37.780 --> 50:39.448
What, are the...

50:39.481 --> 50:41.918
- Sam, where did you go?
- Don't be rude!

50:41.951 --> 50:44.152
Can't you see my cousin is in
the middle of a juicy story?

50:44.186 --> 50:46.488
I'm sorry, <i>habibti,</i> he's fasting.
Anyway, you were saying?

50:46.521 --> 50:47.690
That's okay, <i>ba'rah.</i>

50:47.724 --> 50:48.758
- Alia...
- Alia is Muna's girlfriend.

50:49.157 --> 50:51.894
...has been super stressed because
her sister is getting a divorce.

50:51.928 --> 50:54.563
- <i>Haram.</i>
- No, her husband's gay.

50:54.797 --> 50:55.598
She helped him come
out of the closet.

50:55.832 --> 50:58.166
- They're both doing very well.
- Oh, fresh meat.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.267
What's his name?
Maybe I know him?

50:59.301 --> 51:01.436
Her husband? Hussein?

51:01.638 --> 51:03.171
Hussein? Is that the...

51:03.205 --> 51:04.473
Hassan. Hassan Saad.

51:05.240 --> 51:06.308
Hassan Saad?

51:08.543 --> 51:10.680
Oh, it's hard to say, you know.

51:10.713 --> 51:12.582
We gays, we all know each other.

51:12.615 --> 51:16.184
Just gay, gay, gay,
gaying it up all the time.

51:16.218 --> 51:17.486
You two are really annoying.

51:17.519 --> 51:19.554
Oh, so sorry, <i>habibti.</i>
It's all Mo's fault.

51:19.589 --> 51:20.723
Show some respect.

51:20.757 --> 51:22.391
Please go on. You were saying?

51:22.424 --> 51:24.761
Apparently Hassan's been dating
this guy in LA for, like,

51:24.794 --> 51:26.763
- the last three years.
- Hmm.

51:26.796 --> 51:28.196
He sounds like a real <i>hmar.</i>

51:29.231 --> 51:30.465
How so?

51:30.499 --> 51:31.901
Well, you know how it is.

51:31.934 --> 51:33.970
Hassan only married a woman
to get his dad off his back.

51:34.003 --> 51:35.805
This guy just
couldn't see the big picture.

51:36.204 --> 51:38.675
If he had just been patient with
him, they would both be together.

51:38.708 --> 51:41.744
Hassan is so lucky he found a
bride that was so supportive.

51:41.778 --> 51:43.378
Ugh.

51:43.412 --> 51:45.313
Unlike that boyfriend of his,
who is now apparently MIA.

51:45.347 --> 51:46.683
Oh my God, scandal.

51:46.716 --> 51:48.183
But what a strong bride.

51:48.951 --> 51:50.552
How did his parents take it?

51:50.586 --> 51:52.487
- Oh, his dad died.
- Died?

51:52.755 --> 51:55.692
Not literally,
but he didn't take it well.

51:55.925 --> 51:57.827
Yeah, Mo. Not everyone's
parents are like yours.

51:58.895 --> 52:00.697
I should really get going.

52:00.730 --> 52:03.498
Almost time to break fast.

52:05.902 --> 52:07.670
I don't know, girl.

52:07.704 --> 52:09.772
She's been in a mood.
I'll catch up with you later.

52:09.806 --> 52:12.340
- Mmm, gays.
- Muna!

52:23.052 --> 52:25.487
- So, do you think...
- Hmm?

52:25.520 --> 52:28.624
I mean, there are so many gay
Hassan's out there, right?

52:28.658 --> 52:29.759
Sam.

52:29.792 --> 52:32.862
You never know,
but maybe, could be.

52:32.895 --> 52:34.831
Stranger coincidences
have happened.

52:34.864 --> 52:36.565
- Sam.
- Okay, okay, I'll say it.

52:36.599 --> 52:37.834
Your Hassan came out.

52:37.867 --> 52:39.301
Why am I always
the last to know?

52:39.334 --> 52:40.970
- Okay, Sam!
- How can you not tell me?

52:41.003 --> 52:42.739
Well, I didn't know.
I blocked him, remember?

52:44.874 --> 52:47.576
Must've been why
he'd been trying to contact me.

52:47.610 --> 52:50.445
Wow. Such a shame.

52:50.479 --> 52:51.714
What is?

52:51.748 --> 52:52.648
I mean, you heard
what Muna said, right?

52:52.849 --> 52:54.549
- Patience, big picture, all that.
- Big picture?

52:54.584 --> 52:55.952
And what about
what he did to me?

52:55.985 --> 52:57.285
- To you?
- Yeah.

52:57.319 --> 52:58.955
Mo, he was clearly hurting.

52:59.321 --> 53:01.657
Something you never
had to deal with coming out.

53:01.924 --> 53:04.761
You have to realize
how rare your experience is.

53:04.794 --> 53:06.863
You didn't see how much he
hurt my parents, and Tata.

53:07.462 --> 53:08.765
She died of a broken heart.

53:09.165 --> 53:10.933
Mo. You know that's not true.

53:10.967 --> 53:11.968
Sam, <i>khalas.</i>

53:12.168 --> 53:14.003
Just get me home, okay?

53:19.609 --> 53:21.510
I'm fine. Truly.

53:21.878 --> 53:23.713
We just gotta start cooking.

53:23.980 --> 53:25.547
- I'm not cooking.
- I'm not asking you to.

53:25.581 --> 53:26.949
You said "we."

53:27.150 --> 53:29.351
- Oh. Me and Kal.
- Who?

53:29.384 --> 53:30.519
- Kal.
- Val?

53:30.552 --> 53:31.319
John's friend, Val?

53:31.654 --> 53:34.422
His name is Kal.
We've been breaking fast together.

53:35.158 --> 53:36.993
And you're just
telling me this now?

53:37.193 --> 53:39.361
What else is he breaking?
Has he broken your BV?

53:39.394 --> 53:41.931
Tell me everything.
I want details, juicy, dirty details.

53:41.964 --> 53:44.033
Don't make me pull teeth.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.002
You haven't hooked up yet?

53:46.035 --> 53:47.904
Do you even know me?
It's not like that.

53:47.937 --> 53:50.006
How often are you
two "breaking fast?"

53:50.039 --> 53:52.675
- I don't know, like, every night?
- Ahhh!

53:52.708 --> 53:54.644
- Don't make it a thing.
- Every night?

53:55.912 --> 53:58.080
No wonder you've been so low-key
this Ramadan.

53:58.681 --> 54:00.983
Is this why
you haven't invited me over?

54:02.018 --> 54:04.419
You don't ever
need an invitation.

54:05.121 --> 54:07.089
I bet he's a good kisser.

54:07.123 --> 54:09.091
We're just friends,
and I don't kiss my friends.

54:09.125 --> 54:11.894
- Really?
- Plus, it's Ramadan.

54:13.863 --> 54:16.498
Whatever it is,
it's nice to hear that

54:16.531 --> 54:18.734
Hassan is just a
bridge of water.

54:18.768 --> 54:20.002
Water under the bridge.

54:20.036 --> 54:22.772
Yeah, whatever.
London Bridges, I don't care.

54:29.912 --> 54:34.917
<i>♪ Follow every rainbow</i>

54:34.951 --> 54:38.054
<i>♪ Till you find... ♪</i>

54:44.559 --> 54:45.661
Hi.

54:45.695 --> 54:47.630
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- Were you just singing?

54:47.663 --> 54:49.165
No. You could hear that?

54:49.198 --> 54:50.666
The whole neighborhood could.

54:50.700 --> 54:52.735
You have a great voice.
And great taste in music.

54:52.935 --> 54:54.871
- You're early.
- I know.

54:54.904 --> 54:57.773
I couldn't wait to tell you.
I got the part!

54:58.074 --> 55:00.176
The courtroom drama?
My body, my choices?

55:00.209 --> 55:02.044
- Yeah!
- No way! Congrats!

55:02.078 --> 55:03.112
This is so amazing.

55:04.981 --> 55:06.115
Please don't move.

55:06.749 --> 55:09.451
- Uh...
- My towel has fallen.

55:10.820 --> 55:12.088
Okay.

55:12.121 --> 55:14.891
Um, squat down with me.

55:14.924 --> 55:16.092
I'll grab it.

55:16.125 --> 55:17.927
You immediately turn around.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.128
Mo, it's not that big of a deal.

55:19.161 --> 55:20.897
Just squat down with me!

55:20.930 --> 55:21.964
Okay.

55:28.804 --> 55:30.606
Oh! Wait! Wait! Oh!

55:31.007 --> 55:32.174
Okay. Okay.

55:32.208 --> 55:33.743
Sorry I shouted.

55:33.776 --> 55:35.912
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Sorry. Sorry.

55:35.945 --> 55:38.614
I think I felt you break
your fast against my leg.

55:39.649 --> 55:41.651
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

55:41.684 --> 55:43.686
Anyway, I could not have done it
without your help,

55:43.719 --> 55:47.489
so I'd like to
take you somewhere.

55:47.522 --> 55:49.457
But, what about dinner?

55:49.491 --> 55:52.628
Well, we'll do this first,
and then I thought

55:52.662 --> 55:54.096
I'd take you to dinner.

55:54.997 --> 55:57.099
- Like, out?
- Yeah.

55:57.366 --> 55:58.968
Like, a date.

55:59.168 --> 56:00.736
Oh.

56:00.770 --> 56:02.171
If that's okay.

56:04.140 --> 56:05.808
No. Yeah, of course.

56:05.841 --> 56:09.178
Um, uh, just let me
throw some clothes on.

56:09.211 --> 56:11.113
- Okay.
- It's not karaoke, is it?

56:11.347 --> 56:13.816
No. No. It's not karaoke.

56:20.856 --> 56:23.025
Okay, okay. All right.
We're sitting.

56:23.059 --> 56:25.661
Just sit, very... Yes.

56:25.695 --> 56:27.129
What are we doing?

56:27.495 --> 56:29.632
We're at a water park.
What do you think we're doing?

56:29.665 --> 56:31.267
We're at the movies!

56:31.300 --> 56:34.502
Obviously, but what...

56:46.582 --> 56:48.483
Oh, my God, really?

56:59.561 --> 57:00.562
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

57:02.732 --> 57:04.233
<i>Easy, Miss. I've got you.</i>

57:04.266 --> 57:05.768
<i>You... You've got me.</i>

57:05.801 --> 57:07.169
<i>Who's got you?</i>

57:33.095 --> 57:34.529
He's a fan.

57:36.298 --> 57:39.835
And Miss Teschmacher saves
Superman only to prove the point

57:39.869 --> 57:42.271
that even Superman needs saving
from time to time.

57:42.505 --> 57:43.739
- You know...
- Kal?

57:45.007 --> 57:46.642
Honey...

57:46.976 --> 57:50.012
I thought
that was you.

57:55.217 --> 57:56.819
Hi, I'm Mo.

57:57.386 --> 57:59.989
Um, Judy. Hello.

58:02.158 --> 58:04.960
You look more like him...

58:04.994 --> 58:06.028
What are you doing here?

58:07.396 --> 58:09.165
I bought tickets months ago.

58:09.198 --> 58:12.034
I... I thought I would surprise
your father

58:12.068 --> 58:14.003
or maybe the two
of you could go.

58:14.036 --> 58:15.938
I'm not here for him, Judy.

58:19.308 --> 58:22.011
Sorry. He wasn't really
a role model for his kids.

58:22.645 --> 58:23.679
Oh, God.

58:26.248 --> 58:27.950
Listen, we're celebrating.

58:27.983 --> 58:29.718
Kal just landed a big role.

58:30.219 --> 58:33.189
Oh, still doing
that acting thing.

58:37.393 --> 58:40.329
Judy, it was nice to see you.

58:42.765 --> 58:44.266
It was lovely to meet you.

58:46.235 --> 58:47.870
Yeah.

58:47.903 --> 58:51.040
You... You two take care.

59:07.022 --> 59:10.292
That was my dad's current wife.

59:13.963 --> 59:16.866
My mom's been dead
since I was 16.

59:19.702 --> 59:22.338
I'm sorry. It's just not
something I like to talk about.

59:22.371 --> 59:23.906
No, I'm sorry.

59:23.939 --> 59:25.641
We don't have to talk about it.

59:27.977 --> 59:30.379
I wish I still had
her to talk to,

59:30.713 --> 59:33.716
like you have your
mom and your tata.

59:39.755 --> 59:42.358
Ah, it's just a prop.

59:43.192 --> 59:46.862
When I talk to my grandmother,
I use the phone,

59:46.896 --> 59:48.797
but it's just a prop.

59:49.231 --> 59:51.100
She died around a year ago.

59:51.800 --> 59:55.838
We used to talk every day, so...
So I just use it.

59:56.906 --> 1:00:01.277
I like to feel like I can
still leave her messages or texts.

1:00:02.144 --> 1:00:05.114
- This must sound crazy.
- No. It's not crazy.

1:00:06.081 --> 1:00:08.217
Losing someone is hard.

1:00:09.885 --> 1:00:11.220
I lost the wrong parent.

1:00:19.094 --> 1:00:21.397
It happened a long
time ago. Uh...

1:00:21.997 --> 1:00:24.266
She was diagnosed with cancer

1:00:24.300 --> 1:00:26.068
when we were in Jordan,

1:00:26.101 --> 1:00:27.803
and, uh,

1:00:27.836 --> 1:00:30.306
she wanted to get treatment
back in the States,

1:00:30.339 --> 1:00:32.808
but she stayed with
my dad instead,

1:00:34.043 --> 1:00:37.813
and she got worse...

1:00:40.182 --> 1:00:42.017
And he drank more.

1:00:44.186 --> 1:00:46.789
And then she died,

1:00:46.822 --> 1:00:48.123
and he kept drinking.

1:00:48.357 --> 1:00:51.794
He must have
felt so guilty, poor guy.

1:00:53.495 --> 1:00:54.830
Yeah.

1:00:54.863 --> 1:00:56.832
That and he's a
selfish alcoholic.

1:00:56.865 --> 1:00:58.200
People grieve in different ways.

1:00:58.234 --> 1:01:00.102
You don't know him, Mo.

1:01:00.469 --> 1:01:01.937
Don't defend him.

1:01:02.538 --> 1:01:04.740
You don't know what
she put up with.

1:01:09.345 --> 1:01:10.412
Vegetarian.

1:01:10.446 --> 1:01:12.014
Beef shawarma.

1:01:12.381 --> 1:01:13.983
Enjoy.

1:01:17.319 --> 1:01:19.822
I think you're making too big
a deal out of it.

1:01:19.855 --> 1:01:21.190
I can't do this again.

1:01:21.223 --> 1:01:23.225
I can't get into
another Hassan situation

1:01:23.259 --> 1:01:25.160
where the guy
has all this family drama,

1:01:25.194 --> 1:01:26.829
and I gotta take care of it.

1:01:26.862 --> 1:01:29.265
You know how important parents
and family are to me.

1:01:29.298 --> 1:01:31.066
Is Kal asking you
to take care of him?

1:01:31.100 --> 1:01:32.301
Well, no, but...

1:01:32.334 --> 1:01:33.535
- But what?
- Switch!

1:01:33.869 --> 1:01:36.372
Maybe you should just accept
his situation for what it is,

1:01:36.405 --> 1:01:38.307
recognize that
it's not your situation,

1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:40.442
and support him
when he needs it.

1:01:40.476 --> 1:01:42.244
Geez, didn't Muna
teach you anything?

1:01:42.278 --> 1:01:44.280
I know, but I keep
mentioning parents,

1:01:44.313 --> 1:01:45.281
and reverence for parents,

1:01:45.649 --> 1:01:48.250
and <i>"imack, imack, imack,"</i>
and he doesn't seem to get it.

1:01:48.284 --> 1:01:49.518
Back row!
What is going on?

1:01:49.551 --> 1:01:51.353
Too much talking!
Not enough sweating!

1:01:51.387 --> 1:01:53.522
Damn straight.

1:01:53.555 --> 1:01:54.990
You're getting me in trouble.

1:01:55.024 --> 1:01:56.292
And you really do talk too much.

1:01:56.325 --> 1:01:57.459
And stop bringing up parents.

1:01:57.493 --> 1:01:58.595
It's none of your business.

1:01:58.628 --> 1:02:00.429
Who do you think you're helping?

1:02:00.462 --> 1:02:02.164
Switch!

1:02:02.197 --> 1:02:03.165
Oh...

1:02:08.504 --> 1:02:10.272
Stop pushing Kal away.

1:02:10.306 --> 1:02:12.841
Try sympathizing with him
and what he's going through.

1:02:13.108 --> 1:02:15.444
Hmm. You're right.

1:02:15.978 --> 1:02:17.980
I have to tell him
what's bothering me

1:02:18.013 --> 1:02:19.081
and put it behind me.

1:02:19.114 --> 1:02:20.215
Good for you.

1:02:20.249 --> 1:02:22.518
Now tell me, who's cuter?

1:02:22.551 --> 1:02:23.519
Him...

1:02:25.287 --> 1:02:26.522
Or John?

1:02:31.026 --> 1:02:33.596
You know I can't work out
during Ramadan.

1:02:33.630 --> 1:02:34.930
I get headaches.

1:02:34.963 --> 1:02:36.265
You're giving me a headache.

1:02:41.070 --> 1:02:42.204
Time to mix the salad.

1:02:42.237 --> 1:02:43.505
Five minutes till Iftar.

1:02:45.507 --> 1:02:48.210
Hey. You know in act two
of <i>Into the Woods,</i>

1:02:48.243 --> 1:02:50.379
when the Mysterious Man
comes back from the dead

1:02:50.412 --> 1:02:53.583
to tell the baker to stop
running away from his problems?

1:02:54.450 --> 1:02:56.051
I was thinking...

1:03:02.625 --> 1:03:04.059
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:03:04.093 --> 1:03:05.260
We figured you'd be
sitting down to dinner,

1:03:05.294 --> 1:03:06.528
so we thought we'd crash.

1:03:06.562 --> 1:03:07.996
We?

1:03:08.030 --> 1:03:09.198
Hey, Mo.

1:03:09.231 --> 1:03:10.466
Hi, John.

1:03:10.866 --> 1:03:12.201
Hey, you guys!

1:03:12.234 --> 1:03:13.469
- <i>Itfadloo.</i>
- That means come in.

1:03:14.804 --> 1:03:16.472
And take your shoes
off, Mo has rules.

1:03:19.174 --> 1:03:21.410
Mmm, yeah. Well...

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:25.114
Okay.

1:03:25.147 --> 1:03:26.315
What's that about?

1:03:26.348 --> 1:03:27.950
Well, it's when you...

1:03:27.983 --> 1:03:29.485
- Oh, it's...
- It's considered...

1:03:29.518 --> 1:03:31.553
- No, no, you go.
- No, you go.

1:03:31.588 --> 1:03:34.289
Um, well, it's considered rude

1:03:34.323 --> 1:03:36.291
to have the soles
of your shoes facing God.

1:03:36.325 --> 1:03:38.093
He does it everywhere we go.

1:03:38.127 --> 1:03:39.128
Oh.

1:03:40.229 --> 1:03:42.297
Sounds time consuming.

1:03:44.433 --> 1:03:45.934
Oh, my God.

1:03:45.968 --> 1:03:47.202
Isn't he so hot?

1:03:47.236 --> 1:03:49.037
Ooh, it smells great in here.

1:03:49.071 --> 1:03:50.038
Really?

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:51.440
It smells a little ethnic.

1:03:52.007 --> 1:03:53.509
- Oh, that's just garlic.
- Have you ever heard of it, <i>habibi?</i>

1:03:53.542 --> 1:03:55.010
I'll go get two
more place settings.

1:03:55.043 --> 1:03:56.545
- Great.
- Great.

1:04:00.315 --> 1:04:02.084
Plates.

1:04:04.052 --> 1:04:05.387
This looks...

1:04:06.121 --> 1:04:07.389
So interesting.

1:04:07.423 --> 1:04:09.258
Thanks, John.

1:04:09.291 --> 1:04:10.993
We made it all from scratch.

1:04:11.026 --> 1:04:12.561
You made this?

1:04:12.595 --> 1:04:15.531
Hmm, now I am really intrigued.

1:04:17.366 --> 1:04:18.934
Uh...

1:04:19.702 --> 1:04:22.304
What? Are we supposed to say
Muslim grace or something?

1:04:22.337 --> 1:04:24.072
There's a couple more minutes.

1:04:24.106 --> 1:04:25.240
Until?

1:04:25.274 --> 1:04:27.242
Iftar time. John.

1:04:30.112 --> 1:04:31.313
Okay...

1:04:31.547 --> 1:04:33.716
I'll just put this...

1:04:45.494 --> 1:04:47.162
Oh, it's time.

1:04:48.230 --> 1:04:49.531
Thank you.

1:05:02.478 --> 1:05:03.545
Dig in.

1:05:06.482 --> 1:05:08.116
Wow. Rice.

1:05:09.619 --> 1:05:10.720
There you go.

1:05:10.753 --> 1:05:12.287
- Oh, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:05:18.126 --> 1:05:19.294
Mmm.

1:05:20.095 --> 1:05:21.296
Wow, Kal,

1:05:21.330 --> 1:05:22.632
this is actually really good.

1:05:22.665 --> 1:05:24.634
Thanks. Mo and I
made it together.

1:05:24.667 --> 1:05:27.269
Hardly. I'm barely allowed
to stir the rice.

1:05:27.302 --> 1:05:29.505
Well, you go too
fast.

1:05:29.538 --> 1:05:32.675
I bet that's the first time anyone's
ever said that, huh, ya, Mo?

1:05:32.709 --> 1:05:34.176
Hey.

1:05:34.443 --> 1:05:36.613
Here. Does anyone want
any of this wine?

1:05:37.747 --> 1:05:40.282
Oh, uh, Mo keeps a dry house.

1:05:40.683 --> 1:05:42.551
Really? It's just wine.

1:05:43.051 --> 1:05:45.554
I know, but be respectful.

1:05:45.588 --> 1:05:47.724
You can go one meal
without a drink.

1:05:49.692 --> 1:05:51.059
Yeah, you're right.

1:05:51.093 --> 1:05:52.762
Sorry, I forgot you were sober.

1:05:57.399 --> 1:05:59.736
I'm trying to take a break
from the scene.

1:06:00.202 --> 1:06:02.137
Plus it's Ramadan.

1:06:03.706 --> 1:06:05.240
Okay.

1:06:05.274 --> 1:06:09.177
Wait, Sam, isn't...
Isn't it Ramadan for you too?

1:06:09.211 --> 1:06:11.380
But weren't you drinking
at the pool party?

1:06:11.413 --> 1:06:12.649
<i>Habibi,</i> I told you.

1:06:12.682 --> 1:06:15.117
My parents are Muslim,
but I don't practice.

1:06:15.384 --> 1:06:17.452
Mo here is Mr. Islam.

1:06:17.486 --> 1:06:19.187
Sam is exaggerating.

1:06:19.221 --> 1:06:20.757
I wouldn't call
myself super-devout,

1:06:20.790 --> 1:06:23.292
but I try to observe
the practice.

1:06:23.492 --> 1:06:24.761
Well, yeah.

1:06:24.794 --> 1:06:26.796
You... You pray, you fast,
you don't drink.

1:06:26.829 --> 1:06:28.163
Seems pretty devout to me.

1:06:28.196 --> 1:06:29.699
You know, I do those things,
but for me

1:06:29.732 --> 1:06:31.801
Islam, at its
core, is a mindset,

1:06:31.834 --> 1:06:33.435
not just bowing and kneeling.

1:06:33.468 --> 1:06:35.237
Wow, so,

1:06:35.270 --> 1:06:37.640
your Islam also
allows you to be gay?

1:06:37.907 --> 1:06:39.241
Here we go.

1:06:39.274 --> 1:06:40.777
Well, it's
not just my Islam.

1:06:41.577 --> 1:06:44.179
There is no punishment
for being gay in the Qur'an,

1:06:44.948 --> 1:06:47.584
nor were gay people persecuted
by the Prophet Muhammad.

1:06:47.617 --> 1:06:49.284
Peace Be Upon Him.

1:06:50.787 --> 1:06:52.521
Homophobia and anti
- gay sentiments...

1:06:52.554 --> 1:06:54.122
Became the norm

1:06:54.156 --> 1:06:56.558
once Arab countries
were colonized by Britain.

1:06:57.794 --> 1:07:00.128
So it's our fault.

1:07:01.296 --> 1:07:02.197
I'm so lost.

1:07:02.397 --> 1:07:04.199
You know, you're used
to seeing violence against

1:07:04.232 --> 1:07:05.802
the gay community
in Muslim countries,

1:07:05.835 --> 1:07:08.503
but that's political regime,

1:07:08.537 --> 1:07:10.439
not Muslim teaching.

1:07:10.472 --> 1:07:12.709
Those people do not represent
God's view.

1:07:13.009 --> 1:07:14.376
And you do?

1:07:14.409 --> 1:07:15.712
I try to.

1:07:15.745 --> 1:07:17.279
Tolerance. Patience.

1:07:17.479 --> 1:07:18.848
Not sitting in judgment.

1:07:19.514 --> 1:07:21.784
Those are some
of the fundamentals of Islam

1:07:21.818 --> 1:07:23.518
that I practice.

1:07:23.552 --> 1:07:27.122
Frankly, being gay has taught me
to be a better Muslim.

1:07:28.725 --> 1:07:31.293
Well, that's not something
you hear every day.

1:07:31.861 --> 1:07:33.428
Sam, you taking notes?

1:07:34.097 --> 1:07:36.231
It's not that simple for me.

1:07:36.264 --> 1:07:37.667
What do you mean?

1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:39.401
Well, <i>habibi,</i>

1:07:39.434 --> 1:07:41.303
Mo's thinking sounds good,

1:07:41.336 --> 1:07:42.905
especially when
your only reference point

1:07:42.939 --> 1:07:44.841
for those countries is CNN.

1:07:44.874 --> 1:07:46.341
But, truth be told,

1:07:46.743 --> 1:07:48.510
God doesn't save
you from radicals

1:07:48.543 --> 1:07:50.545
who view you as an abomination.

1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:52.547
Where I come from,
three men were thrown off a roof

1:07:52.582 --> 1:07:54.282
last week for being gay.

1:07:54.684 --> 1:07:56.886
I can't bow down to a god
who created that world.

1:07:56.919 --> 1:07:58.655
Man created that world, not God.

1:07:59.088 --> 1:08:01.958
People murder in God's name
every day, Mo.

1:08:01.991 --> 1:08:03.593
Absolving God's role in that

1:08:03.626 --> 1:08:05.193
doesn't help the persecuted,
now does it?

1:08:06.428 --> 1:08:07.664
You're ignoring their problems

1:08:07.697 --> 1:08:08.931
because they're
not your problems.

1:08:08.965 --> 1:08:11.934
I'm not making excuses
for any of that, Sam,

1:08:11.968 --> 1:08:14.302
but, blaming God is always
your go-to cop-out.

1:08:14.637 --> 1:08:16.338
It's not a cop-out.

1:08:16.371 --> 1:08:18.306
I'm pointing out the flaws
in your logic.

1:08:18.340 --> 1:08:20.810
You're so educated,
but you're also so blind

1:08:20.843 --> 1:08:22.577
to the problems
that Islam creates.

1:08:22.779 --> 1:08:24.847
Whoa. That seems a little harsh.

1:08:35.024 --> 1:08:36.659
And I'm not blind.

1:08:37.860 --> 1:08:39.361
Really?

1:08:39.762 --> 1:08:40.797
What about Hassan?

1:08:43.565 --> 1:08:45.333
- Who's Hassan?
- Oh, he's nobody.

1:08:45.735 --> 1:08:47.970
Yes. Just another Muslim nobody

1:08:48.004 --> 1:08:49.739
with a different perspective
from Mo's.

1:08:49.772 --> 1:08:51.941
You have to be Muslim
to be a Muslim nobody.

1:08:54.309 --> 1:08:55.712
There she is.

1:08:55.745 --> 1:08:58.380
Thank you, Mo,
for reminding me why religion

1:08:58.413 --> 1:08:59.949
isn't for everyone.

1:08:59.982 --> 1:09:03.318
Some of us prefer to live a life
without judgment.

1:09:03.351 --> 1:09:04.721
Okay. Guys, come on, it's...

1:09:04.754 --> 1:09:06.989
Uh-uh, Kal. Watch out.

1:09:07.023 --> 1:09:09.524
Not falling in line
could get you thrown out,

1:09:09.558 --> 1:09:12.394
excommunicated,
or blocked from his cell phone.

1:09:52.434 --> 1:09:53.636
Um...

1:09:56.072 --> 1:09:57.472
Where's Kal?

1:09:58.841 --> 1:10:00.743
He got a phone call
from the hospital.

1:10:00.777 --> 1:10:02.078
He had to go. It
sounded serious.

1:10:02.111 --> 1:10:03.311
His brother, you know?

1:10:03.679 --> 1:10:05.447
Kal has a brother?

1:10:35.077 --> 1:10:36.378
You okay?

1:10:38.114 --> 1:10:39.615
I'm okay, yeah, thanks.

1:10:39.649 --> 1:10:41.784
Uh, just a false alarm.

1:10:42.919 --> 1:10:46.388
Look, I get it if you don't want
to talk about your family,

1:10:46.421 --> 1:10:47.924
but I wish you would.

1:10:48.991 --> 1:10:50.525
Okay, Mo.

1:10:51.661 --> 1:10:53.361
My mom's dead.

1:10:53.663 --> 1:10:55.430
My dad's an alcoholic.

1:10:55.463 --> 1:10:57.332
My stepmom enables him.

1:10:58.668 --> 1:11:00.002
And I have a brother named Adam

1:11:00.036 --> 1:11:02.038
who's been in a coma here
for six months.

1:11:02.437 --> 1:11:04.439
There, happy?

1:11:06.441 --> 1:11:08.144
Oh, I... I... I...

1:11:08.177 --> 1:11:10.512
Every family is
complicated. I get it.

1:11:10.545 --> 1:11:11.848
Oh, I can't do this right now.

1:11:11.881 --> 1:11:12.648
What?

1:11:13.115 --> 1:11:15.618
I'm sorry. I... I can't be
vulnerable with you right now.

1:11:16.252 --> 1:11:17.887
What do you mean by that?

1:11:18.721 --> 1:11:20.656
My God.

1:11:22.191 --> 1:11:25.761
I know you have a great
relationship with your family.

1:11:26.028 --> 1:11:27.562
I don't.

1:11:27.597 --> 1:11:28.931
I'll say.

1:11:28.965 --> 1:11:30.933
I mean, I didn't even know
that you have a brother,

1:11:30.967 --> 1:11:33.769
let alone he's been in my
hospital for six months?

1:11:34.804 --> 1:11:36.005
I'm sorry.

1:11:38.841 --> 1:11:41.744
We weren't close,
but I was making an effort.

1:11:42.678 --> 1:11:44.647
We spent New Year's together.

1:11:46.548 --> 1:11:48.985
We both drank a
lot and we fought.

1:11:53.222 --> 1:11:55.691
He took my keys,
and I didn't stop him.

1:11:57.126 --> 1:11:59.128
It's not your fault, Kal.

1:11:59.161 --> 1:12:01.063
Yeah, tell that to my dad.

1:12:01.097 --> 1:12:03.733
He blames us both.
He hasn't talked to me.

1:12:03.766 --> 1:12:05.433
He's never visited Adam.

1:12:06.002 --> 1:12:08.905
You've been dealing
with all of this alone?

1:12:08.938 --> 1:12:10.773
I'm used to it.

1:12:12.775 --> 1:12:15.177
I can't imagine your dad
is not in agony over this.

1:12:15.211 --> 1:12:16.846
I mean, no parent wants
this for their kid.

1:12:16.879 --> 1:12:19.181
Oh, easy man. I don't need your
bright-siding right now.

1:12:19.215 --> 1:12:21.784
- I'm sorry?
- Your bright-siding.

1:12:21.817 --> 1:12:24.921
You always spin things in a way
that ignores what's wrong.

1:12:24.954 --> 1:12:26.856
It's not a spin, Kal.

1:12:27.757 --> 1:12:31.727
It's faith, and my faith tells
me everything will work out.

1:12:35.530 --> 1:12:36.899
Is that lonely?

1:12:37.300 --> 1:12:38.935
Is what lonely?

1:12:38.968 --> 1:12:41.469
Your inability to get down in
the mud with the rest of us

1:12:41.503 --> 1:12:43.571
when everything
isn't working out.

1:12:43.606 --> 1:12:45.174
Is this about what Sam said?

1:12:45.207 --> 1:12:46.642
You have an issue with my faith?

1:12:46.676 --> 1:12:48.044
I do not,

1:12:48.077 --> 1:12:49.745
and neither does Sam.

1:12:50.478 --> 1:12:53.149
But you aggressively
bright-sided him

1:12:53.182 --> 1:12:55.818
the minute he brought up
the darker side of Islam.

1:12:55.851 --> 1:12:57.653
There is no darker
side of Islam.

1:12:57.687 --> 1:12:59.655
Not the Islam you follow,

1:12:59.689 --> 1:13:01.090
but that doesn't invalidate

1:13:01.123 --> 1:13:04.126
Sam's experiences,
his feelings, his fears.

1:13:05.328 --> 1:13:08.898
The religion you follow doesn't
allow people to kill in Allah's name,

1:13:08.931 --> 1:13:10.733
but that doesn't
mean people don't.

1:13:11.734 --> 1:13:13.235
Uh, listen, I get it.

1:13:13.269 --> 1:13:15.137
It's been a very
emotional night,

1:13:15.171 --> 1:13:17.640
and I get your impulse
to attack, but...

1:13:17.673 --> 1:13:19.976
Stop it, Mo! Stop doing that!

1:13:20.508 --> 1:13:21.444
I'm not attacking you.

1:13:21.644 --> 1:13:24.613
I am challenging you,
and you're brushing it off.

1:13:25.547 --> 1:13:29.852
It's like this sick twisted
bright side coping mechanism.

1:13:29.885 --> 1:13:32.054
You shut down any potential
for disagreement.

1:13:32.088 --> 1:13:33.689
I'm not shutting down, Kal.

1:13:33.723 --> 1:13:35.557
I'm defending my beliefs.

1:13:37.059 --> 1:13:39.628
You don't have
to defend yourself to me, Mo.

1:13:40.562 --> 1:13:41.797
I accept you.

1:13:41.831 --> 1:13:43.165
You don't know
anything about me.

1:13:45.034 --> 1:13:46.568
Okay, then.

1:13:46.602 --> 1:13:47.970
Tell me how things
ended with Hassan.

1:13:48.004 --> 1:13:49.005
Oh, my God. Why?

1:13:49.405 --> 1:13:51.974
Because you blocked your ex.
I think we should talk about that.

1:13:52.008 --> 1:13:53.776
He left me
to marry a woman.

1:13:53.809 --> 1:13:54.877
Because of Islam?

1:13:54.910 --> 1:13:57.913
Because of his
family, their views.

1:13:58.948 --> 1:14:00.049
They challenged yours.

1:14:00.082 --> 1:14:01.549
They were wrong.

1:14:01.584 --> 1:14:03.185
I'm not saying they weren't,
but do you think

1:14:03.219 --> 1:14:05.821
you helped him by refusing
to talk to him?

1:14:05.855 --> 1:14:07.323
- Oh, you weren't there.
- You're right.

1:14:07.356 --> 1:14:09.825
I wasn't.
And I don't have all the answers.

1:14:09.859 --> 1:14:11.894
Not about Islam,
and certainly not about your ex,

1:14:11.927 --> 1:14:13.095
but that's not my point.

1:14:13.129 --> 1:14:14.797
What is your point, Kal?

1:14:15.631 --> 1:14:17.066
Mo,

1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:20.568
I like you a lot.

1:14:22.004 --> 1:14:24.273
Your humor,

1:14:24.306 --> 1:14:26.275
your love of musicals,

1:14:26.308 --> 1:14:28.044
your relationship
with your family,

1:14:28.077 --> 1:14:29.745
and especially your faith.

1:14:35.051 --> 1:14:36.685
Do you like me?

1:14:41.290 --> 1:14:43.225
What do you like about me?

1:15:21.831 --> 1:15:24.366
<i>You have
reached the mailbox of...</i>

1:15:24.567 --> 1:15:26.168
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

1:15:26.202 --> 1:15:28.003
<i>and cannot accept
any messages at this time.</i>

1:15:28.037 --> 1:15:29.305
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1:17:02.431 --> 1:17:03.899
<i>Assalam-alaikum.</i>

1:17:03.933 --> 1:17:05.301
<i>Walaikum-assalam</i>

1:17:09.505 --> 1:17:11.173
I'm glad you called.

1:17:13.008 --> 1:17:14.210
You sure you want to do this?

1:17:15.010 --> 1:17:16.345
I'll be fine.

1:17:17.980 --> 1:17:19.348
Okay.

1:17:29.959 --> 1:17:32.294
So, how are you?

1:17:32.328 --> 1:17:34.096
Your family? Your dad?

1:17:34.129 --> 1:17:35.264
He's not with us anymore.

1:17:35.297 --> 1:17:37.333
- What?
- <i>Haram,</i> I'm just kidding.

1:17:37.366 --> 1:17:38.867
He moved back to Lebanon.

1:17:40.436 --> 1:17:42.972
He's fine. Or he will be.

1:17:43.005 --> 1:17:45.140
Everyone will be.
I get that know.

1:17:45.709 --> 1:17:47.509
I mean, the guilt
is still with me,

1:17:47.543 --> 1:17:49.044
but that's been
with me for so long,

1:17:49.078 --> 1:17:50.813
it's not just gonna disappear,

1:17:51.347 --> 1:17:54.817
but somehow now it's, uh,
more manageable.

1:17:57.186 --> 1:17:59.021
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you.

1:17:59.723 --> 1:18:02.324
I just feel terrible
I wasn't more supportive.

1:18:02.825 --> 1:18:05.327
No, I shouldn't have
asked you to be.

1:18:06.095 --> 1:18:07.529
I loved you,

1:18:07.563 --> 1:18:09.465
but I was hurting you.

1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:14.270
So, I hear you're seeing
some hot white guy now.

1:18:14.303 --> 1:18:15.904
How's that?

1:18:16.338 --> 1:18:17.873
Sam told me.

1:18:17.906 --> 1:18:18.874
Oh, you still talk to Sam?

1:18:19.074 --> 1:18:22.478
No, but he called me up
after he got my news from Muna.

1:18:22.511 --> 1:18:25.281
He related and he offered
to help me out,

1:18:25.314 --> 1:18:26.949
to talk whenever I needed.

1:18:27.383 --> 1:18:29.952
He welcomed me
into the Gay-rab family.

1:18:31.954 --> 1:18:33.555
Sam was a better friend than me.

1:18:33.590 --> 1:18:35.157
Listen, Mo.

1:18:35.190 --> 1:18:36.525
You're a good friend,

1:18:36.558 --> 1:18:38.127
and you were a great boyfriend,

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:39.995
when I fit into your life.

1:18:40.562 --> 1:18:42.564
I just...

1:18:42.599 --> 1:18:44.466
I just needed
some help problem-solving,

1:18:44.500 --> 1:18:45.434
that's all.

1:18:45.702 --> 1:18:48.504
And I'm constantly re-framing
everyone else's problems

1:18:48.537 --> 1:18:50.506
as if they're my own,

1:18:50.539 --> 1:18:52.241
which is not helpful.

1:18:54.009 --> 1:18:55.277
I'm the worst.

1:18:55.511 --> 1:18:58.013
You are the worst.

1:18:58.047 --> 1:18:59.248
I'm kidding.

1:18:59.448 --> 1:19:01.116
No one thinks that.

1:19:02.585 --> 1:19:04.219
Sam loves you.

1:19:07.590 --> 1:19:09.558
You deserve to be loved.

1:19:30.446 --> 1:19:32.247
I'm proud of you.

1:19:33.282 --> 1:19:34.617
Thanks.

1:19:36.385 --> 1:19:38.153
Oh, it's a shame.

1:19:38.554 --> 1:19:40.956
Your mom's really gonna
miss my mloukhieh this year.

1:20:04.213 --> 1:20:05.280
Hungry?

1:20:05.815 --> 1:20:07.116
I brought your favorite.

1:20:08.350 --> 1:20:09.586
You can't tell from the outside,

1:20:09.619 --> 1:20:11.120
but this bag is all ketchup.

1:20:16.959 --> 1:20:18.260
Heard you've been eating alone.

1:20:18.595 --> 1:20:20.028
Where'd you hear that?

1:20:20.462 --> 1:20:22.398
I read it on the Internet.

1:20:22.431 --> 1:20:24.533
No, really. I read
it on the Internet.

1:20:24.566 --> 1:20:26.603
Your mom posted a
status about it.

1:20:32.541 --> 1:20:33.342
That woman.

1:20:33.743 --> 1:20:36.245
Well, no point in letting
that ketchup going to waste.

1:20:36.278 --> 1:20:37.579
Seven minutes till I can eat.

1:20:37.614 --> 1:20:39.381
Yeah. Like I don't know.

1:20:51.493 --> 1:20:54.396
I don't even know
what to say at this point.

1:20:54.430 --> 1:20:58.033
He sees me as this rigid,
self-centered loner

1:20:58.066 --> 1:20:59.501
who runs from challenges.

1:21:00.335 --> 1:21:01.537
And he's not wrong.

1:21:01.570 --> 1:21:03.205
He's not wrong.

1:21:03.238 --> 1:21:05.474
So surprise him.
Go out of your comfort zone.

1:21:05.675 --> 1:21:07.242
Invite him to an orgy!

1:21:07.276 --> 1:21:08.310
Come on!

1:21:08.343 --> 1:21:09.978
Challenge yourself!

1:21:10.446 --> 1:21:13.382
Look, life is messy,

1:21:14.216 --> 1:21:15.685
but it's also exciting

1:21:16.485 --> 1:21:19.288
and sometimes you
meet a Superman.

1:21:19.321 --> 1:21:20.989
And sometimes you meet...

1:21:22.625 --> 1:21:23.992
John.

1:21:26.161 --> 1:21:27.730
John's not so bad.

1:21:27.963 --> 1:21:29.599
John's an asshole,
and you know it.

1:21:29.632 --> 1:21:31.200
But who cares about him.

1:21:31.233 --> 1:21:35.370
<i>Yallah,</i> Mo, ya Mohammed,
go, find Kal, talk to Kal.

1:21:36.271 --> 1:21:38.474
Just be open. Be honest.

1:21:40.509 --> 1:21:42.277
I'm scared.

1:21:45.047 --> 1:21:46.315
Trust me, <i>habibi.</i>

1:21:48.484 --> 1:21:50.720
I know it might sound scary,

1:21:50.753 --> 1:21:52.755
but right now,
it's your turn to be Maria,

1:21:53.322 --> 1:21:55.257
to leave the convent,

1:21:55.290 --> 1:21:57.259
get on that trolley,

1:21:57.292 --> 1:21:59.127
and go get that captain.

1:21:59.161 --> 1:22:00.462
Who are you right now?

1:22:00.496 --> 1:22:02.498
I don't even know
what I'm saying right now.

1:22:02.732 --> 1:22:04.667
What did you put
in this ketchup?

1:22:06.134 --> 1:22:07.369
You should go see him.

1:22:07.402 --> 1:22:09.438
I'm not just gonna show up
at his house.

1:22:10.239 --> 1:22:12.474
- He's not home.
- How do you know?

1:22:12.508 --> 1:22:14.309
The Internet told me.

1:22:15.344 --> 1:22:16.646
Wait, what day is it?

1:22:16.679 --> 1:22:18.247
Thursday, why?

1:22:35.832 --> 1:22:38.333
Hey, Kal,

1:22:38.367 --> 1:22:40.269
we're gonna take
the next one off your stomach.

1:22:40.837 --> 1:22:42.304
I'll be right back.

1:22:42.337 --> 1:22:43.405
Come on.

1:22:43.438 --> 1:22:44.206
Okay, queens.

1:22:44.439 --> 1:22:46.308
<i>You're in
for a treat tonight.</i>

1:22:46.341 --> 1:22:48.143
<i>We are about to take someone's

1:22:48.176 --> 1:22:49.612

1:22:51.446 --> 1:22:52.481
Hey, how's it going?

1:22:52.514 --> 1:22:54.817
<i>...lube up and be gentle.</i>

1:23:04.192 --> 1:23:05.695
Yeah, sorry.

I thought you hated karaoke.

1:24:29.078 --> 1:24:31.179
I thought so too,

1:24:31.213 --> 1:24:32.915
but someone told me to open up.

1:24:33.816 --> 1:24:35.618
Something I have to
work on, I guess.

1:24:36.853 --> 1:24:38.487
That was awesome.

1:24:38.788 --> 1:24:40.188
Thank you.

1:24:40.522 --> 1:24:41.658
You need to pay the choir.

1:24:41.691 --> 1:24:44.159
Three hundoes. ATM's
by the bathroom.

1:24:45.293 --> 1:24:46.729
Way to "Sing up, Louise!"

1:24:46.763 --> 1:24:48.831
It's "out." "Sing out, Louise."

1:24:50.232 --> 1:24:51.968
You and Sam made up, I see.

1:24:52.001 --> 1:24:53.803
Yeah, he forgave me.

1:24:54.269 --> 1:24:56.773
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

1:24:56.806 --> 1:24:59.274
So, I was thinking.

1:24:59.307 --> 1:25:00.575
Yeah?

1:25:01.176 --> 1:25:04.212
Tomorrow is the last day
of fasting, and...

1:25:05.882 --> 1:25:08.918
I was hoping we could break fast
together one last time?

1:25:09.518 --> 1:25:11.587
You miss my cooking, huh?

1:25:12.487 --> 1:25:13.956
I miss you.

1:25:15.024 --> 1:25:16.425
And my family is coming over.

1:25:16.458 --> 1:25:18.326
I would love for
them to meet you.

1:25:18.728 --> 1:25:20.697
Oh, wow.

1:25:21.130 --> 1:25:23.198
Really? Are you sure?

1:25:24.033 --> 1:25:25.601
Okay.

1:25:25.835 --> 1:25:29.237
You're going to love them.
They're very chill and low-key.

1:25:35.577 --> 1:25:37.212
Shh! Mom. Mom. Mom!

1:25:42.350 --> 1:25:43.953
Uh, Mama, this is...

1:26:09.712 --> 1:26:11.513
I'll just shut this.

1:26:12.682 --> 1:26:14.684
All right. So I see

1:26:14.717 --> 1:26:16.953
a very big sort of stunt.

1:26:16.986 --> 1:26:18.788
It's very, very...

1:26:18.821 --> 1:26:20.056
Okay.

1:26:20.288 --> 1:26:23.325
All right. So, there's like,
um, a pile of papers, like a stack,

1:26:24.026 --> 1:26:25.995
like maybe, like a script?

1:26:31.701 --> 1:26:33.468
Mama, you shouldn't have.

1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:18.915
<i>El fatiha.</i>

1:27:32.394 --> 1:27:33.395
Let's eat.

1:27:33.996 --> 1:27:35.530

- Oh, my goodness.

1:28:08.998 --> 1:28:10.432

1:28:19.609 --> 1:28:20.877
"Easy, Miss. I've got you."

"You've got me, who's got you?"
