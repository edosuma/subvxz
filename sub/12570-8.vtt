08:19.606 --> 08:21.125
doesn't have to clean his

08:18.083 --> 08:21.125
room or do his homework?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.000
- Or brush his teeth.
- Yes, I did.

08:23.167 --> 08:24.643
- Yeah? Have you smelled
- his breath lately?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.021
It's like the inside

08:26.022 --> 08:27.375
of a decaying,

08:24.667 --> 08:27.375
garlic-loving cat.

08:27.417 --> 08:29.018
- (SNAPS FINGER) - Look!
- (MUSIC CEASES)

08:30.584 --> 08:32.231
That boy is brilliant,

08:32.232 --> 08:33.876
and his breath is only gonna

08:30.584 --> 08:33.876
be an issue for the front row.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.563
Now, thank you

08:36.563 --> 08:38.042
for the gift that is Luke,

08:38.082 --> 08:39.323
- but you need to go.
- Come on.

08:40.626 --> 08:41.876
You know what?

08:41.876 --> 08:43.125
I will go, and I'm taking

08:40.626 --> 08:43.125
"the gift" with me.

08:43.167 --> 08:44.855
No, no, You can't!

08:44.856 --> 08:46.542
He's going to put my dance

08:43.167 --> 08:46.542
studio on the map!

08:46.584 --> 08:47.960
Well, if he doesn't do

08:47.961 --> 08:49.334
his homework he won't be

08:46.584 --> 08:49.334
able to spell map.

08:51.042 --> 08:52.403
- Luke, we're leaving.
- (LAUGHING)

08:53.209 --> 08:54.369
- No! I don't want
- to leave!

08:54.959 --> 08:56.280
- Sorry, but my mind
- is made up.

08:57.042 --> 08:58.584
Nanny! Wait!

08:58.585 --> 09:00.125
Do that again!

09:02.167 --> 09:03.083
Do what again?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.918
That dramatic turn.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.959
(GASPING)

09:10.542 --> 09:12.231
Such regal posture,

09:12.232 --> 09:13.918
such swan-like grace!

09:13.959 --> 09:15.351
- Obviously,
- you've danced before.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.293
(CHUCKLES) Well,

09:17.294 --> 09:19.209
I don't mean to brag,

09:15.375 --> 09:19.209
but I was on drill team.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.042
- (GASPING)
- There was a whole thing

09:21.083 --> 09:22.584
- In the school paper
- about it.

09:22.626 --> 09:23.959
- You probably
- didn't see it.

09:24.042 --> 09:25.334
No, no, no.

09:25.375 --> 09:26.772
Well, I didn't have to.

09:26.773 --> 09:28.167
You're a natural danseuse.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.126
I want, nay,

09:32.127 --> 09:34.167
I need you to

09:30.083 --> 09:34.167
join this class,

09:34.209 --> 09:35.518
- and perform
- with us on Saturday

09:35.542 --> 09:37.459

- You Call That Dancing?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.563
Yes, that's the full title.

09:45.564 --> 09:47.042
Please keep up.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.268
- That's my favorite show
- of all time!

09:48.292 --> 09:49.814
Me, too! And now,

09:49.815 --> 09:51.334
now that I have Luke,

09:51.375 --> 09:53.042
and you, of course,

09:53.083 --> 09:54.250
I'm going to win!

09:54.292 --> 09:55.959
You mean we're going to win!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.022
Oh! I can't wait to

09:57.023 --> 09:58.042
brag about this at

09:56.000 --> 09:58.042
the drill team reunion!

09:58.334 --> 09:59.626
- (PANT RIPPING)
- Oh.

10:01.292 --> 10:02.000
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- I really hope that ripping

10:01.292 --> 10:02.292
Noise was my pants.

10:05.667 --> 10:06.959
Tony, we need to

10:06.960 --> 10:08.250
talk to you about

10:05.667 --> 10:08.250
a secret admirer.

10:08.292 --> 10:10.168
Yes, a young lady

10:10.169 --> 10:12.042
in the building is quite

10:08.292 --> 10:12.042
taken with you.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.147
Is this about

10:13.148 --> 10:14.209
Mrs. Felton in 14D?

10:14.250 --> 10:16.000
- With the constant
- prune deliveries?

10:17.375 --> 10:19.209
She's not exactly "young."

10:19.210 --> 10:21.042
I think she went to prom

10:17.375 --> 10:21.042
with Abe Lincoln.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.083
No! It's Zuri.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.084
Zuri? No way!

10:26.085 --> 10:28.042
Why would little Zuri

10:24.125 --> 10:28.042
have a crush on me?

10:28.667 --> 10:30.375
Well, for starters,

10:30.376 --> 10:32.083
you enjoy the same cartoons.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.584
They are not cartoons.

10:34.626 --> 10:36.542
- They are animated
- musical extravaganzas.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.459
Those ponies are artists.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.292
You need to be careful,

10:42.334 --> 10:43.667
because my psychology

10:43.668 --> 10:45.000
textbook says Zuri is at

10:42.334 --> 10:45.000
a very delicate age,

10:45.042 --> 10:46.063
when rejection could

10:46.064 --> 10:47.083
affect her for the rest

10:45.042 --> 10:47.083
of her life.

10:47.417 --> 10:48.771
Oh, no. Okay...

10:48.772 --> 10:50.125
What should I do?

10:50.167 --> 10:52.042
- Just make sure to
- let Zuri down easy,

10:52.083 --> 10:53.542
So she won't end up

10:53.543 --> 10:55.000
and living alone

10:52.083 --> 10:55.000
and feeding 30 cats!

10:56.083 --> 10:57.626
That would be horrible!

10:58.375 --> 10:59.834
If you think that is bad,

10:59.835 --> 11:01.292
you should see

10:58.375 --> 11:01.292
Emma's blots.

11:01.334 --> 11:02.481
They are sparkly

11:02.482 --> 11:03.626
tableaus of misery.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.959
Pop, step, swing,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.250

- A ring on it.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.980
Why did you leave me

11:21.981 --> 11:23.709
a to-do list of your jobs?

11:23.751 --> 11:24.876
So it would be

11:24.877 --> 11:26.000
easier for you

11:23.751 --> 11:26.000
to do them?

11:26.626 --> 11:27.647
No, no. I'm not covering

11:27.648 --> 11:28.667
all your duties

11:28.709 --> 11:29.855
just so you can rehearse

11:29.856 --> 11:31.000

11:31.250 --> 11:33.042
- Hey, it's just
- three more days.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.105
Then you can get back

11:34.106 --> 11:35.125
to your strict

11:33.083 --> 11:35.125
whining schedule.

11:35.542 --> 11:37.250

- doing here?

11:39.023 --> 11:40.250

11:40.292 --> 11:43.209

11:50.834 --> 11:52.064
You're going home.

11:52.065 --> 11:53.292

11:50.834 --> 11:53.292
a breath mint.

so no one could see them?

15:36.751 --> 15:38.417
Fine.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.584
I guess I just have to eat

15:39.585 --> 15:40.709
a lot more cereal to

15:38.459 --> 15:40.709
complete my set.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.522
Look, Zuri, I know

15:44.523 --> 15:46.542
you're at a very delicate

15:42.500 --> 15:46.542
age right now,

15:47.083 --> 15:48.647
and I don't want to

15:48.648 --> 15:50.209
say anything that'll

15:47.083 --> 15:50.209
make you end up

15:50.250 --> 15:52.480
uh, living in Rome

15:52.481 --> 15:54.709
and eating dirty cats.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.460
Did you hit your head

16:00.461 --> 16:02.209
playing choo-choo

15:58.709 --> 16:02.209
on the luggage cart again?

16:03.334 --> 16:04.792
No way.

16:04.793 --> 16:06.250
I padded that thing

16:03.334 --> 16:06.250
after the last time.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.772
Look, I heard you

16:08.773 --> 16:10.459
have a little crush on me.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.147
And I'm really flattered,

16:12.148 --> 16:13.792
because you're awesome,

16:13.834 --> 16:15.501
but I think you should find

16:15.502 --> 16:17.167
someone a little closer

16:13.834 --> 16:17.167
to your own age.

16:17.459 --> 16:18.709
(LAUGHING)

16:21.834 --> 16:23.397
You think I have

16:23.398 --> 16:24.959
a crush on you?

16:21.834 --> 16:24.959
Who told you that?

16:25.292 --> 16:26.334
Emma and Ravi!

16:26.584 --> 16:28.167
And you believed them?

16:29.500 --> 16:30.710
Well, Emma is

16:30.711 --> 16:31.918
studying psychology.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.189
Oh, please. Last year

16:34.190 --> 16:36.417
she thought geometry was

16:31.959 --> 16:36.417
the study of the letter G!

16:38.375 --> 16:39.375
It's not!

16:42.751 --> 16:44.314
Luke, what's wrong?

16:44.315 --> 16:45.876
Phil told us you quit.

16:45.918 --> 16:47.584
- He said you had
- stage fright.

16:47.626 --> 16:49.042
- And I said
- that's ridiculous,

16:49.083 --> 16:50.188
Because on the red carpet

16:50.189 --> 16:51.292
for your dad's

16:49.083 --> 16:51.292
last premiere,

16:51.334 --> 16:53.000
- you photo-bombed
- Jennifer Lawrence.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.000
Oh, she loved it.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.771
I quit because Phil

16:58.772 --> 17:00.500
was just using you guys

16:57.042 --> 17:00.500
to keep me in class.

17:00.542 --> 17:01.751
BOTH: What?

17:02.125 --> 17:03.292
Ah! That makes sense.

17:03.334 --> 17:04.416
I blame you.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.688
Wait. So, you quit

17:09.689 --> 17:11.000
because of us?

17:11.834 --> 17:12.939
Yeah.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.041
Aw, that is so sweet.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.041
- And stupid.
- What?

17:16.083 --> 17:17.938
Luke, you are brilliant

17:17.939 --> 17:19.791
at dancing, and you've

17:16.083 --> 17:19.791
worked so hard.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.271
You shouldn't give up

17:21.272 --> 17:22.709
this opportunity because

17:19.834 --> 17:22.709
of me and Bertram.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.396
But I'll have lots of

17:24.397 --> 17:26.041
opportunities to dance

17:22.751 --> 17:26.041
in front of people.

17:26.083 --> 17:27.396
You guys stink,

17:27.397 --> 17:28.709
so this was

17:26.083 --> 17:28.709
your only chance.

17:30.959 --> 17:32.400
- Well, this shouldn't
- be about us.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.063
Anyway, I am so glad

17:36.064 --> 17:38.042
I convinced you to take

17:34.083 --> 17:38.042
dance in the first place.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.709
Actually, the cute girls

17:39.710 --> 17:41.334
in class convinced me.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.647
Okay, but I'm the one

17:42.648 --> 17:43.918
who convinced you

17:41.375 --> 17:43.918
to stay in the class.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.680
- Actually, that was
- the lack of homework.

17:46.334 --> 17:47.501
Come on,

17:47.502 --> 17:48.667
just throw her a bone.

17:46.334 --> 17:48.667
This is getting sad.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.563
You know what, Jessie?

17:53.564 --> 17:55.042
You were the one

17:52.083 --> 17:55.042
who told me

17:55.083 --> 17:56.894
- to get serious about
- dancing in the first place.

17:56.918 --> 17:58.667
And you were right.

17:58.709 --> 18:00.293
I never really thought

18:00.294 --> 18:01.876
about what I want to do

17:58.709 --> 18:01.876
with my life before,

18:01.918 --> 18:02.980
and now I know

18:02.981 --> 18:04.042
I want to be a dancer.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.417
So, thank you.

18:05.876 --> 18:06.876
You're welcome.

18:10.669 --> 18:11.918
a great career.

18:11.959 --> 18:13.584
- If your parents
- are really rich.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.751
- Now get out there
- and dance.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.042
- Hurry up, - the show starts
- In two minutes!

18:18.083 --> 18:19.459
Thanks, guys.

18:19.460 --> 18:20.834
This is so much better

18:18.083 --> 18:20.834
than doing homework!

18:20.876 --> 18:22.792
- Which you're
- still doing later!

18:22.834 --> 18:24.375
- No, he won't.
- I know.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.397
Do you think Tony

18:28.398 --> 18:29.709
has spoken to Zuri yet?

18:29.751 --> 18:31.189
I don't know.

18:31.190 --> 18:32.626
But I hope, if he did,

18:29.751 --> 18:32.626
he let her down easy.

18:32.959 --> 18:35.001
Unlike Brock, the cruel

18:35.002 --> 18:37.042
quarterback who broke

18:32.959 --> 18:37.042
that poor cheerleader's heart!

18:37.083 --> 18:38.563
Let it go! That blot

18:38.564 --> 18:40.042
was supposed to be

18:37.083 --> 18:40.042
a butterfly!

18:40.083 --> 18:41.334
You said there were

18:41.335 --> 18:42.584
no wrong answers.

18:42.626 --> 18:44.000
- And yet
- you came up with one!

18:47.083 --> 18:49.042
Hey, guys. What's new?

18:49.083 --> 18:50.542
Someone told Tony

18:50.543 --> 18:52.000
that I had a crush on him.

18:52.042 --> 18:53.542
(GASPS) Who would do that?

18:53.543 --> 18:55.042
I do not know what

18:52.042 --> 18:55.042
you are talking about.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.230
Relax, she knows

18:56.231 --> 18:57.375
it was you guys.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.098
- Turns out, it's
- someone else she likes.

19:00.209 --> 19:01.292
Two guys whose

19:01.293 --> 19:02.375
names start with a T.

19:02.417 --> 19:03.751
What are the odds?

19:06.042 --> 19:08.375
The boy I like is Tommy.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.230
He's a grade ahead of me,

19:10.231 --> 19:12.042
and a star pitcher

19:08.417 --> 19:12.042
on the baseball team.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.501
Ah, yes.

19:13.502 --> 19:14.918
I have seen him

19:12.083 --> 19:14.918
in the halls.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.335
But since he is popular,

19:16.336 --> 19:17.709
we have never actually met.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.355
Well, you're about to,

19:21.356 --> 19:23.626
because his mom

19:19.083 --> 19:23.626
is taking us to a movie!

Doesn't he look

19:27.919 --> 19:29.042
so cute in his uniform?

19:29.083 --> 19:30.417
Not too shabby.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.876
- Hi, I'm...
- Bye.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.417
- Why didn't Zuri
- introduce us?

19:37.751 --> 19:39.043
It is almost as if she

19:39.044 --> 19:40.334
is embarrassed by us.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.000
I can't imagine why.

19:47.584 --> 19:49.042
Be right back.

19:52.209 --> 19:54.501
Tony, I'm really sorry

19:54.502 --> 19:56.792
I put you in such an awkward

19:52.209 --> 19:56.792
position with Zuri.

19:57.167 --> 19:59.125
- I guess I'm not
- so good at psychology.

19:59.167 --> 20:01.042
It's okay.

- for by mistake,

20:07.084 --> 20:08.084
to be an astronaut.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.000
So, you're not mad at me?

20:11.500 --> 20:12.751
No way.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.044
- You were just looking
- out for your kid sister.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.542
- And I think
- that's really sweet.

20:16.584 --> 20:18.667

- to talk about it.
