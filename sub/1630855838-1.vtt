Father Fox:
Forgive me, My Lord. I can't.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.649
Russian Bishop:
You would refuse the call?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.566
This nun, Sister Yulia,
has asked for you by name.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.437
Father Fox:
I have given you plenty notice.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.918
Stayed on months longer than
I should have, at your request,

08:04.092 --> 08:05.528
performed exorcisms
I don't believe in...

08:05.702 --> 08:07.835
Well, this isn't an exorcism.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.751
This is verification
of a divine event

08:10.925 --> 08:13.101
- and some translating.
- Father Fox: Bishop, I'm sorry.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.798
[in Russian]

08:17.061 --> 08:18.410
Father Fox: [in English]
My Lord, I saved that girl

08:18.585 --> 08:19.890
from her family, not the devil.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.457
I was fighting mental illness.

08:22.763 --> 08:26.549
You healed her
when nobody else could.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.725
Do you deny that?

08:28.986 --> 08:30.814
I did what all priests
are supposed to do.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.686
I gave her my love
and attention.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.905
I made her realize
that her life had value,

08:35.079 --> 08:36.516
that she was a child of God.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.735
That is when
her illness stopped.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.129
Russian Bishop: Mm. Perhaps,

08:41.346 --> 08:43.261
but Sister Yulia's case
seems to be different.

08:43.653 --> 08:46.264
Local priests have confirmed
its authenticity.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.267
It's time for me to move on.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.966
To be a good Christian
rather than a bad priest.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.229
Russian Bishop: You really
shouldn't feel so guilty

08:54.403 --> 08:55.665
for what you have done.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.233
Priestly celibacy
is rooted in tradition.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.018
Not Catholic dogma.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.281
If it were just an affair
and I planned to end things,

09:03.455 --> 09:06.546
it would be different. But...
[chuckles] ...I love this woman.

09:07.677 --> 09:10.941
And the child she's carrying
deserves a real father.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.161
Mm.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.427
Speaking of love,

09:19.733 --> 09:24.172
this nun, Sister Yulia,
is pregnant with twins.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.217
She claims it's immaculate.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.307
She says her two unborn kids
talk to her,

09:29.786 --> 09:31.745
and that she knows
that one of them is good

09:32.572 --> 09:33.660
and one is evil.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.665
Take a read, would you, for me?

09:40.928 --> 09:42.146
Father Fox: [sighs]

09:43.147 --> 09:46.586
Cardinal Russo will personally
oversee the verification.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.805
He's an expert
in ancient languages,

09:48.979 --> 09:49.980
just like you.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.592
Why's the Vatican
sending a famous scholar?

09:52.766 --> 09:53.984
I mean, someone
like Cardinal Russo

09:54.158 --> 09:55.290
could be Pope someday.

09:56.073 --> 09:59.729
It shows you how seriously
the Vatican is taking this case.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.085
Laura: [gasps] Look.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.785
- [dog barks]
- Laura: [laughing]

10:11.959 --> 10:15.353
- Come here, Plato. Hey.
- Laura: Hi.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.272
Buddy, come here.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.189
How did it go?

10:25.886 --> 10:27.148
Father Fox: As well as expected.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.367
How you feeling?

10:29.890 --> 10:33.023
Laura: A little sick
this morning, but I'll be okay.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.505
[church bell tolling]

10:43.033 --> 10:46.994
Schizophrenia,
abusive childhood...

10:48.604 --> 10:50.127
immaculate conception.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.913
[exhales heavily]
This woman needs help.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.089
You should go.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.568
You know she's not
actually possessed.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.222
Laura: I know that, but...

10:59.267 --> 11:01.051
isn't this being
a good Christian,

11:01.225 --> 11:02.749
rather than a bad priest?

11:03.750 --> 11:06.448
- Making fun of me?
- [laughs] I'm not.

11:06.753 --> 11:10.017
I'm saying that even if you
have to pretend to be a priest

11:10.191 --> 11:12.889
to help this woman,
that's Christian. No?

11:13.716 --> 11:15.762
Well, technically,
I still am a priest.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.504
But... I have
a different purpose now.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.420
I don't want this
to take me away from you.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.337
It won't take me away from you.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.167
[pensive music playing]

11:31.342 --> 11:33.170
I have to go to Estonia
for work.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.520
You'll probably be back
before I am.

11:36.913 --> 11:41.831
And when I get back,
we should talk about Canada.

11:43.615 --> 11:46.662
I think Edmonton would be
a great place to raise a family.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.883
But tell the bishop
it's the last one,

11:50.057 --> 11:51.406
and that you mean it.

11:53.582 --> 11:56.541
[music builds, fades]

13:22.062 --> 13:22.976
[in Russian]

13:34.378 --> 13:35.858
[door opens]

13:41.908 --> 13:44.736
Sister Sniger: [in English]
His Eminence, Cardinal Russo.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.611
Your Eminence.
It's such an honor.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.266
[in Russian]

13:53.180 --> 13:55.138
[in English]
I have read all of your work.

13:55.704 --> 13:58.185
I can't tell you
how flattered I was

13:58.359 --> 13:59.839
to be referenced so often

14:00.013 --> 14:03.059
in your doctoral thesis
on the cuneiform alphabet.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.800
You read my thesis?

14:05.018 --> 14:07.324
It seems no matter
how old one gets,

14:07.498 --> 14:09.196
there's always
something to learn

14:09.370 --> 14:10.545
from the next generation.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.766
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to show you something.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.531
Cardinal Russo:
What is it, Father?

14:43.099 --> 14:44.100
You have doubts?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.887
Father Fox:
I'm sorry, Your Eminence.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.193
The colder it gets outside,
the more hot water we use,

14:50.367 --> 14:51.891
and when hot water
passes through cold air,

14:52.065 --> 14:53.980
you get condensation.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.248
Have there been any developments
outside the initial report?

15:01.422 --> 15:03.554
Sister Yulia refuses
to talk with anyone...

15:04.468 --> 15:05.774
except you.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.863
Father Saul: Do you have any
idea why that might be?

15:10.300 --> 15:16.002
Ah. Father Fox, please allow me
to introduce Father Saul.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.141
I, uh, suppose
what happened in Murmansk, or...

15:25.663 --> 15:27.622
perhaps because there are
so few Catholics in Russia.

15:30.886 --> 15:31.931
I see.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.195
Sister Sniger: [in Russian]

15:53.474 --> 15:55.519
[door creaks open]

16:06.617 --> 16:08.271
[in Russian]

16:08.968 --> 16:10.621
Sister Yulia: [in English]
Good afternoon, Father.

16:11.231 --> 16:14.408
[in Russian]

16:17.933 --> 16:19.065
[in English] You speak English.

16:21.589 --> 16:22.677
Sister Yulia: Yes.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.245
They didn't tell me that.

16:26.724 --> 16:27.856
Where did you learn English?

16:29.162 --> 16:30.815
[exhales heavily] I didn't.

16:32.339 --> 16:35.298
Uh. The only reason
I'm able to speak English

16:35.472 --> 16:37.257
is so that I can speak with you.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.002
Why don't you tell me
why you became a nun?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.270
For purpose. At first.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.534
Then as time goes by,

16:53.708 --> 16:57.233
you realize that you have
come here to die.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.064
But in my case, God said, "No."

17:02.238 --> 17:04.806
And that is why
he's given me children,

17:04.980 --> 17:06.590
because he wants me to live.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.683
You don't think that
these children are from God.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.556
I think all children
are from God.

17:17.471 --> 17:20.909
Well, I suppose
that you are right.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.611
Why did you ask to speak to me?

17:28.960 --> 17:29.918
Sister Yulia: Uh...

17:31.093 --> 17:33.226
They... they tell me things.

17:33.530 --> 17:36.055
Things I would have
no other way of knowing.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.362
And they told me about you.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.452
What did they tell you about me?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.281
They told me you are
the only one

17:45.673 --> 17:48.545
that can keep the bad thing
from happening.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.375
You think something bad
is gonna happen to you?

17:52.549 --> 17:55.074
Sister Yulia: I didn't bring you
here today, Father.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.380
The Church didn't bring
you here.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.165
God brought you here.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.559
They are trying
to stop His plan.

18:02.733 --> 18:03.734
[door creaks open]

18:04.605 --> 18:05.997
They think they know better.

18:06.911 --> 18:09.000
Um. We're not finish--

18:09.175 --> 18:10.654
Old Nun: [in Russian]

18:11.090 --> 18:12.352
[in English] We need your help.

18:12.526 --> 18:13.570
Father Fox:
Hey, Sister. We're not...

18:18.009 --> 18:19.272
[door creaks open]

18:25.756 --> 18:28.455
[reporter speaking on TV]

18:29.978 --> 18:31.458
Father Fox: [in Russian]

18:31.632 --> 18:33.721
[reporter speaking on TV
continues]

18:57.527 --> 18:58.963
Father Fox: [in English]
You wanted to see me,

18:59.138 --> 19:00.400
- Your Eminence?
- Ah.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.576
Father Fox. Please come in.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.100
- Uh, help yourself to a drink.
- Father Fox: I shouldn't.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.321
As you wish.
Do you recognize this language?

19:09.583 --> 19:11.933
It's cuneiform, obviously,
but it's not Sumerian.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.369
It's not Akkadian.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.197
It's a syllabary
I've never seen before.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.504
I believe this to be
a secretive language

19:17.678 --> 19:20.246
used by an elite class
of Zoroastrian priests.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.074
Kind of like the lost language
of the druids.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.946
And this is the original text,

19:25.120 --> 19:26.208
transferred from
person to person

19:26.382 --> 19:27.905
for thousands of years.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.951
Father Fox: What, uh, kind of
material is this written on?

19:30.125 --> 19:31.474
Cardinal Russo:
There are others. Look.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.389
All of these
are telling the same story.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.479
Hebrew, Coptic, Arabic,
Avestan, and Akkadian.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.353
"A virgin will give birth
to twin boys,

19:41.223 --> 19:43.225
one good, one evil."

19:44.183 --> 19:46.185
"Before the Messiah
can learn to love,

19:46.359 --> 19:48.622
the Antichrist will try
and kill his brother."

19:49.362 --> 19:50.667
"He will use the holy man... "

19:50.841 --> 19:53.148
Both: "...the soldier,
and the father."

19:56.107 --> 19:58.458
I don't think this word
is supposed to mean "virgin."

19:58.632 --> 20:00.460
I think it implies
that the Messiah

20:00.634 --> 20:03.071
will be born a virgin birth,
but that the devil

20:03.245 --> 20:05.029
will have to enter her
through free will.

20:06.379 --> 20:09.251
She'll have to choose
to have sex with a man.

20:09.991 --> 20:10.948
Of course.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.430
Why didn't I think of that?

20:16.345 --> 20:19.696
[unsettling music playing]

20:40.500 --> 20:41.849
[unsettling music fades]

20:47.333 --> 20:48.899
You think this prophecy
might be real.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.292
It's quite possible.

20:50.466 --> 20:51.815
Sister Yulia
is carrying twin boys.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.992
This is Zoroastrian scripture,

20:55.166 --> 20:56.472
more than a thousand years
before Christ.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.518
The others and I believe
that this prophecy

20:58.692 --> 21:00.868
is as divinely inspired
as the Book of Revelation.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.132
It's not Christian.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.831
I was told you were
a bit of a doubting Thomas.

21:10.181 --> 21:13.054
Your Eminence, from what
I've seen here today...

21:14.360 --> 21:17.058
not to mention Sister Yulia's
history of mental illness,

21:17.363 --> 21:19.713
if it were up to me, she would
already be in a hospital.

21:20.714 --> 21:25.109
She saw things as a child.
Visions she didn't understand.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.504
Her parents, doctors,
everyone thought

21:28.678 --> 21:31.246
she was hallucinating
so they medicated her,

21:32.378 --> 21:36.120
when, in fact, I believe
she saw visions from God.

22:18.293 --> 22:22.645
Thank you, Father Fox.
You've been most helpful.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.647
You're dismissed.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.045

27:09.105 --> 27:11.455
Father Saul: It will keep her
sedated while we induce labor.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.067
Cardinal Russo: Labor? I thought
this was an abortion.

27:14.545 --> 27:15.851
Father Saul: It is.

27:16.504 --> 27:19.376
But this late in the pregnancy,
this is how it has to be done.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.117
Cardinal Russo:
But what if you're wrong?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.817
Our duty is to the Church.
To the teachings of Christ.

27:25.774 --> 27:28.168
We cannot kill the Christ child.

27:28.516 --> 27:29.517
We have to.

27:30.431 --> 27:31.562
If they are born,

27:32.041 --> 27:33.564
they'll bring about
the end of days.

27:36.480 --> 27:41.790
The choice is our burden,
our sacrifice.

27:43.749 --> 27:47.753
That is vox Dei's mission
on Earth, Your Eminence.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.408
Cardinal Russo: God help us.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.760
[footsteps approaching]

28:14.475 --> 28:15.606
Killing children?

28:16.346 --> 28:17.913
That's what you've been
sent here to do?

28:18.087 --> 28:20.307
The time will come when
the Antichrist and the Messiah

28:20.481 --> 28:23.092
will be born together.
But not now.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.704
What are you talking abou...

28:25.878 --> 28:27.357
You actually believe
this nonsense?

28:27.531 --> 28:29.708
She could not possibly
have known what she knows.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.666
- Those things.
- What things?

28:31.884 --> 28:35.322
Cardinal Russo: Visions she saw
when she was a child.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.063
- The prophecy says...
- Your Eminence,

28:37.237 --> 28:38.673
you are a Cardinal of
the Church of Saint Peter.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.719
If you do this, you will
damn yourself to hell.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.851
I'm sorry, but vox Dei...

28:43.112 --> 28:45.593
Vox Dei? God... God's Voice?
What does that mean?

28:45.767 --> 28:48.204
We are charged
with protecting humanity.

28:48.378 --> 28:49.684
[Sister Yulia groans softly]

28:52.513 --> 28:54.341
Cardinal Russo:
The Antichrist will return...

28:55.690 --> 28:58.737
when mankind is furthest
from God.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.264
Your Eminence,
she's just a girl.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.749
She wants these children.

29:27.504 --> 29:28.767
[groans softly]

29:34.163 --> 29:35.295

Gentle. That's it.

33:06.332 --> 33:09.117

Scientists have observed

40:13.759 --> 40:15.674
extreme shifts
in global ocean tides,

40:15.848 --> 40:17.719
likely brought on
by abnormal activity

40:17.893 --> 40:20.026
in the Earth's core
and rotation speed.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.855
These oceanic shifts
have nudged the moon off

40:23.029 --> 40:24.465

40:24.857 --> 40:26.989
Such a phenomenon

[chuckles, sniffles]

44:03.815 --> 44:04.946
Laura: [in Russian]

44:14.652 --> 44:15.957
[continues talking on phone]

44:22.485 --> 44:23.617
[door opens]

44:25.619 --> 44:26.794
Sister Yulia: [in English]
Father...

44:28.666 --> 44:30.145
let me check your wound.

44:31.277 --> 44:32.191
Okay.

44:36.804 --> 44:39.328
Oh, you tore a stitch.

44:56.781 --> 44:58.086
I think you'll be okay.

45:12.927 --> 45:14.537
Oh, I can come back if...

45:14.755 --> 45:16.017
- Father Fox: No.
- Oh, no.

45:16.191 --> 45:18.890
It's fine.
Let me walk you to your car.

45:27.637 --> 45:29.378
How long can they stay here for?

45:30.075 --> 45:31.641
Laura: As long as they need.

45:31.946 --> 45:34.601
This place is on company land
and I have no use for it.

45:35.123 --> 45:36.342
Thank you for doing this.

45:38.605 --> 45:41.608
You mentioned Canada,
raising our family there.

45:42.304 --> 45:43.523
Laura: Yeah?

45:43.697 --> 45:44.480
Father Fox:
I think a fresh start

45:44.654 --> 45:45.699
would be good for us.

45:46.961 --> 45:50.138
Really? You mean it?

45:50.965 --> 45:52.967
I don't think we can go back
to Saint Petersburg.

45:53.838 --> 45:55.622
I'm sorry to put us
in danger like this.

45:55.796 --> 45:58.843
No, no, no, no.
Don't apologize.

46:01.802 --> 46:05.153
A person who saves one life,
saves the world.

46:08.940 --> 46:12.900
Baby: [crying]

46:13.248 --> 46:15.033
Laura: Are you sure
you don't need to see a doctor?

46:15.598 --> 46:16.730
No, I'm fine.

46:17.252 --> 46:19.080
Sister seems to know
what she's doing. Go.

46:19.951 --> 46:20.865
I love you.

46:23.563 --> 46:25.913
I love you, too.
Get some rest, okay?

46:26.087 --> 46:27.654
- Mm-hmm.
- Laura: I'll be back tomorrow.

46:28.481 --> 46:33.094
Baby: [crying]

46:33.268 --> 46:35.880
[tense music playing]

46:39.709 --> 46:42.190
Baby: [continues crying]

46:46.107 --> 46:48.066
[baby's cries echoing]

46:50.982 --> 46:52.374
[tense music continues]

47:05.648 --> 47:06.867
[Father Saul inhales]

47:46.907 --> 47:48.474
[tense music fades]

48:07.406 --> 48:09.712
- Father Fox: Thank you.
- Sister Yulia: You're welcome.

48:13.847 --> 48:18.069
You know, um, I think
we will be very happy here.

48:22.377 --> 48:27.208
I have never been this happy
and this at peace anywhere else.

48:34.172 --> 48:35.173
[soft chuckle]

48:58.457 --> 49:00.328
[fawn crying]

49:13.211 --> 49:15.735
[fawn crying]

49:16.823 --> 49:20.740
- [fawn crying]
- Whoa, whoa.

49:21.132 --> 49:24.222
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

49:24.483 --> 49:25.397
[fawn snorting]

49:31.838 --> 49:33.666
[pensive music playing]

49:47.375 --> 49:49.769
Hey! That's our dinner.

49:55.818 --> 49:56.819
[fawn cries]

49:59.344 --> 50:03.826
Ah. [laughing] We need the meat.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.395
We get used to the comfort
of this life

50:08.135 --> 50:09.658
and forget the beauty
of this world

50:09.832 --> 50:12.705
is equal to the brutality
it takes to live in it.

50:13.749 --> 50:16.143
Oh, the old man, he left a map.

50:16.317 --> 50:18.885
Shows where the traps are.
He left markings on the trees.

50:19.059 --> 50:20.452
There are nets and springs.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.193
The springs are
the dangerous ones.

50:23.281 --> 50:26.458
[exhales] I feel so free.
Don't you?

50:26.806 --> 50:30.201
I haven't felt this good
in 20 years. [chuckles]

50:30.549 --> 50:33.682
Come. Help me find
the rest of these traps.

50:34.292 --> 50:35.554
We're going to need to

50:36.163 --> 50:37.338
if we're going to have children
running around here someday.

50:37.860 --> 50:38.905
[laughs]

50:39.906 --> 50:42.126
[ominous clock ticking]

50:53.398 --> 50:54.486
Man: [in Russian]

50:54.660 --> 50:56.053
[in Estonian]

50:58.142 --> 50:59.360
[in English]
I'm looking for Laura.

51:00.013 --> 51:01.493
[in Estonian]

51:09.588 --> 51:11.285
[in Estonian]

51:19.293 --> 51:21.426
[intense music playing]

51:41.707 --> 51:43.100
Sister Yulia: [in English]
How's your wound?

51:43.274 --> 51:44.753
Father Fox: Oh, it's fine.

51:45.014 --> 51:47.234
We have to make sure
that the wound isn't infected.

51:47.495 --> 51:48.583
Come on. Sit.

51:55.808 --> 51:56.765
Okay.

51:58.071 --> 51:59.768
This might hurt a little.

52:08.081 --> 52:09.561
[gentle music playing]

52:11.911 --> 52:13.521
Sister Yulia: It's impossible.

52:15.001 --> 52:16.611
It's completely healed.

52:29.972 --> 52:31.104
[breath hitches]

52:32.323 --> 52:33.715
Baby: [wailing]

52:35.456 --> 52:36.718
Sister Yulia:
They're doing this to us.

52:36.892 --> 52:38.198
Father Fox: [sighing]

52:38.459 --> 52:39.504
Sister Yulia:
They want us to be together.

52:39.678 --> 52:41.158
[door opening]

52:42.376 --> 52:43.943
[door closing]

52:48.991 --> 52:50.297
Something smells good.

52:54.301 --> 52:58.262
- [door opening, closing]
- [animal howling]

53:00.786 --> 53:02.309
Cardinal Russo:
Makes perfect sense.

53:02.483 --> 53:06.008
Born in Russia.
Given your location by God.

53:06.357 --> 53:08.315
And look. Here.

53:10.012 --> 53:13.102
See? This is where
you gave birth on the train.

53:13.277 --> 53:14.495
The hallowed elephant.

53:16.018 --> 53:18.325
I believe
this is where we are now.

53:18.847 --> 53:20.458
You will die as a priest...

53:22.460 --> 53:26.507
but be reborn...
as a father of twins.

53:30.294 --> 53:31.991
But this is just one of many.

53:32.818 --> 53:35.690
This is not the prophecy,
but it's a possibility.

53:35.864 --> 53:38.389
It's not set in stone.
It depends what we decide.

53:39.781 --> 53:42.262
You, Father Fox,
you, Sister Yulia...

53:43.568 --> 53:44.656
what you decide.

53:45.787 --> 53:48.225
Babies: [crying]

53:48.399 --> 53:51.532
Cardinal Russo:
They're fighting. Even now.

53:52.141 --> 53:53.969
Neither one is good or bad,

53:54.143 --> 53:57.146
but one is a conduit
for the light.

53:57.495 --> 53:59.453
The other,
a conduit for the Beast.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.762
- [gasps]
- [high-pitched ringing]

54:03.936 --> 54:07.287
Baby: [wails]

54:14.294 --> 54:17.341
[stairs creaking]

54:23.434 --> 54:25.610
[electricity crackles]

54:57.772 --> 54:58.817
[exhales]

55:04.736 --> 55:07.695
[indistinct whispering]

55:12.874 --> 55:14.528
[faint rustling]

55:18.837 --> 55:20.447
[electricity crackles]

55:21.970 --> 55:23.320
[exhales]

55:32.677 --> 55:37.986
Katya: [singing
in foreign language]

55:58.659 --> 56:01.749
- [suspenseful music playing]
- Katya: [continues singing]

56:25.817 --> 56:28.820
[continues singing, stops]

56:34.303 --> 56:38.395
[animal howling]

56:38.569 --> 56:40.135
[suspenseful music fades]

56:41.572 --> 56:44.183
[bell chiming]

56:44.357 --> 56:45.967
Father Fox: [preaching]
At the time he was betrayed

56:46.141 --> 56:48.317
and entered willingly
into his passion.

56:48.492 --> 56:50.972
He took the bread
and giving thanks,

56:51.146 --> 56:54.715
broke it, and gave it
to his disciples, saying,

56:54.889 --> 56:57.501
"Take this,
all of you in need of it,

56:57.675 --> 57:00.939
for this is my body
which will be given up for you."

57:05.117 --> 57:07.989
In a similar way,
when supper was ended,

57:08.163 --> 57:10.775
he took the chalice, and,
once more giving thanks,

57:10.949 --> 57:12.951
he gave it
to his disciples, saying...

57:14.431 --> 57:17.390
"Take this, all of you,
and drink from it."

57:18.522 --> 57:20.524
"For this is the chalice
of my blood,

57:21.525 --> 57:23.962
the blood of the new
and eternal covenant,

57:24.136 --> 57:26.094
which will be poured out
for you and for many

57:26.268 --> 57:28.053
for the forgiveness of sins."

57:28.227 --> 57:29.924
"Do this in memory of me."

57:35.887 --> 57:38.977
[solemn music playing]

57:41.370 --> 57:43.329
[gasps softly]

58:07.527 --> 58:10.791
[solemn music intensifies]

58:14.621 --> 58:18.016
[moans]

58:20.540 --> 58:22.760
[both breathe heavily]

58:23.978 --> 58:25.023
[gasps]

58:27.068 --> 58:28.026
[gasps]

58:33.161 --> 58:37.035
[music swells, fades]

58:37.818 --> 58:40.604
[birds chirping]

58:47.088 --> 58:49.395
Baby: [coos]

58:57.838 --> 58:58.926
Dreams.

58:59.971 --> 59:02.060
It's how
they communicate with us.

59:05.933 --> 59:10.242
Like the men on the train...
we share the same dream.

59:10.459 --> 59:12.810
- [pensive music playing]
- Baby: [coos]

59:12.984 --> 59:14.725
I think we were chosen.

59:18.859 --> 59:20.644
Like Mary and Joseph.

59:22.950 --> 59:24.082
Baby: [coos]

59:31.393 --> 59:33.831
I think
we are meant to be a family.

59:44.668 --> 59:46.495
- [knocking]
- [pensive music concludes]

59:46.670 --> 59:47.801
[sighs]

59:53.502 --> 59:55.722
- Oh, my God. What's happened?
- Laura: It's not mine.

59:55.896 --> 59:58.638
Some asshole at the factory
threw blood on me.

59:58.812 --> 01:00:00.292
[tense music playing]

01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:05.514
[hesitates] Are you...
are you sure you're okay?

01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:06.951
Babe, I'm fine!

01:00:08.082 --> 01:00:09.214
[whispers] I'm fine.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.914
I booked a flight for Canada...

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:17.657
in the morning.
I know it's sudden, but...

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:20.878
sooner is better for all of us.

01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.277
- [tense music concludes]
- [flames crackling]

01:00:29.756 --> 01:00:31.932
[slurps, exhales]

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:36.633
At first, they thought it was
some kind of virus or bacteria,

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:38.330
but now, they're saying
there must be something

01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:40.288
in the air or water,
and, of course,

01:00:40.462 --> 01:00:43.640
they're blaming me,
saying that I'm responsible.

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:46.120
Is there something wrong
with the water?

01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:49.341
No. Multiple tests
have all come back negative.

01:00:49.515 --> 01:00:51.082
I don't know what it is.

01:00:52.387 --> 01:00:53.867
But it's getting scary
out there.

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:55.608
I've never seen people
act like this.

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:01.658
Sister, hi!
How are you and the babies?

01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:04.182
[in Russian]

01:01:07.315 --> 01:01:08.577
[suspenseful music playing]

01:01:11.102 --> 01:01:12.233
[in English] Wow, he...

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:14.845
These are all
my grandfather's paintings.

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:16.411
Father Fox: Yes, the Cardinal.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.370
There's more in the attic
if he's interested.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:21.025
Um... [speaks in Russian]

01:01:22.853 --> 01:01:24.985
[in English]
Um, I will let him know.

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:26.508
Where is the Cardinal?

01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:29.163
Must be hunting.

01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:31.862
[suspenseful music continues]

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:49.009
- [suspenseful music fades]
- Baby: [coos]

01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:52.970
[sighs]

01:01:56.669 --> 01:01:58.105
- Baby: [coos]
- Sister Yulia: This is Jacob.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.934
Laura: Hi.

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:02.544
Sister Yulia:
And this is Samuel.

01:02:02.849 --> 01:02:04.590
Here. You take him.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.246
[hums]

01:02:10.683 --> 01:02:11.902
[coos]

01:02:12.598 --> 01:02:16.602
[suspenseful music playing]

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:26.264
Laura?

01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:35.055
Laura?

01:02:36.491 --> 01:02:37.405
Laura?

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:42.889
[grunts softly]
They're beautiful.

01:02:47.024 --> 01:02:48.286
They're beautiful.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.332
[soft music playing]

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.302
Reporter: [on radio]
...as a mysterious outbreak

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:07.609
continues to ravage Estonia,
leaving experts baffled.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.568
From nausea to psychosis,

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:11.396
whatever's scanning
to the Baltics

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:13.093
is like nothing we've seen
in all of history.

01:03:13.267 --> 01:03:16.009
Some are calling it
a freak plague, others,

01:03:16.183 --> 01:03:17.750
the end of the world.

01:03:17.968 --> 01:03:19.578
Many believe
the outbreak originated

01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:21.885
in the mining region of Kose.

01:03:22.059 --> 01:03:23.974
Some theorize a
past conspiracy,

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:27.020
involving the Kuusik family
going back decades...

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:28.195
[continues indistinctly]

01:03:28.369 --> 01:03:29.762
[in Russian]

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:04.884
[suspenseful music playing]

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:31.911
[in English] Strange.
Katya was supposed to come.

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:03.290
[suspenseful music intensifies]

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.411
Laura: Daniel,
I have some clothes here

01:05:37.585 --> 01:05:39.196
I think Sister Yulia could use.

01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:41.459
Father Fox: Very sweet of you.

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:24.632
[suspenseful music continues]

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:05.934
[cell phone ringing]

01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:08.850
Yeah.

01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:11.592

You're raising good for God...

01:29:02.641 --> 01:29:04.339

This battle
has not been decided.

01:29:14.436 --> 01:29:17.917
You can save humanity
all by yourself.

01:29:20.659 --> 01:29:22.922
You only have to kill
the bad one.

01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:28.145

my love.

01:29:30.408 --> 01:29:32.018

01:29:42.899 --> 01:29:45.336
Kill the child.

01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:49.471
Kill the child.

01:29:49.906 --> 01:29:50.820
Kill...

01:29:50.994 --> 01:29:52.865
...yourself.

01:29:53.518 --> 01:29:59.045
Kill the child. Kill yourself.

01:29:59.219 --> 01:30:01.396
- [gasps sharply]
- [intense music concludes]

01:30:01.918 --> 01:30:04.094
[breathes heavily]

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.588
[gasps sharply]

01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:21.981
Run.

01:30:22.373 --> 01:30:23.505
- [banging on door]
- [dramatic music playing]

01:30:23.679 --> 01:30:25.158
- [banging on door]
- [gasps]

01:30:25.942 --> 01:30:27.509
Father Fox:
Why did you lock this door?

01:30:27.683 --> 01:30:29.989
- [grunting]
- Sister Yulia: [screaming]

01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:32.209
Father Fox:
It hurts my feelings.

01:30:32.383 --> 01:30:36.822
[grunting]

01:30:36.996 --> 01:30:38.911
Hail Mary, full of grace.

01:30:39.651 --> 01:30:40.783
The Lord is with thee!

01:30:41.479 --> 01:30:45.135
[grunts] Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

01:30:45.309 --> 01:30:46.484
[grunts]

01:30:47.137 --> 01:30:50.357
[grunting]

01:30:57.974 --> 01:30:59.410
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

01:31:02.282 --> 01:31:03.762
Fear no more!

01:31:06.635 --> 01:31:07.766
[pants]

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:21.867
[dramatic music concludes]

01:31:24.174 --> 01:31:25.828
[birds chirping]

01:31:30.833 --> 01:31:31.964
[in Estonian]

01:31:42.888 --> 01:31:45.630
Sister Yulia: [in English]
Help! [pants]

01:31:46.457 --> 01:31:48.677
- Officer: [speaking Estonian]
- [in English] Help!

01:31:49.721 --> 01:31:53.551
- [intense music playing]
- Father Fox: [panting]

01:31:55.727 --> 01:31:58.034
Help! He's trying to kill us.

01:31:58.817 --> 01:32:00.950
He's trying to kill my children!

01:32:01.167 --> 01:32:02.778
- Then he wants to kill me!
- [wails]

01:32:02.952 --> 01:32:05.041
- What did you say?
- [high-pitched ringing]

01:32:05.215 --> 01:32:06.390
Huh?

01:32:06.564 --> 01:32:09.349
[high-pitched ringing continues]

01:32:11.874 --> 01:32:13.658
[cries]

01:32:13.832 --> 01:32:15.486
Father Fox: Hey, guys,
don't listen to her.

01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.053
- She's just a crazy bitch!
- What's that in your hands?

01:32:17.227 --> 01:32:19.882
- [shouts]
- [gasping]

01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:24.974
Fuck! Ah!

01:32:25.757 --> 01:32:27.498
- [grunts]
- [screams]

01:32:30.762 --> 01:32:33.156
[breathes heavily, grunts]

01:32:45.124 --> 01:32:47.039
[grunts]

01:32:47.605 --> 01:32:50.260
[screams]

01:33:21.204 --> 01:33:22.553
[pants]

01:33:32.345 --> 01:33:34.260
Father Fox:
This is for your own good!

01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:36.959
We are God's vessel on Earth!

01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:40.919
I'll only kill the bad one.
I know which one is which now.

01:33:41.093 --> 01:33:43.705
Hey, hey. I'll show you.

01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:47.012
Sister Yulia: We are meant
to protect the Messiah

01:33:47.186 --> 01:33:48.579
from his brother!

01:33:48.753 --> 01:33:50.102
Father Fox: The world
doesn't have to end!

01:33:50.276 --> 01:33:51.582
Don't condemn half of humanity,

01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:53.715
because you can't
sacrifice one child.

01:33:53.932 --> 01:33:56.326
Think of Abraham and what
he was willing to do to Isaac.

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.895
Samuel, he is using you!
Remember those dreams.

01:34:00.069 --> 01:34:02.549
- They were a warning.
- That child is the devil!

01:34:02.724 --> 01:34:05.335
- [wails]
- If the world ends now,

01:34:05.509 --> 01:34:07.337
most of humanity
will be damned to hell.

01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:09.818
You cannot save the world alone.

01:34:10.383 --> 01:34:13.648
It will take all of us,
all of us together to do that.

01:34:13.822 --> 01:34:18.957
- I alone have to.
- Fox... this isn't you.

01:34:19.392 --> 01:34:21.743
[sobs]
You must be somewhere in there.

01:34:21.917 --> 01:34:23.309
- Please.
- [thunder rumbling]

01:34:23.483 --> 01:34:25.355
- Give me the child.
- Please.

01:34:26.922 --> 01:34:28.140
Give me the child.

01:34:29.098 --> 01:34:31.274
- Please.
- Give me the fucking child!

01:34:31.448 --> 01:34:33.363
God made the world like this
for a reason.

01:34:33.537 --> 01:34:36.409
The good and the bad.
And we must save both!

01:34:37.106 --> 01:34:40.500
- He didn't save Laura.
- [thunder roaring]

01:34:40.892 --> 01:34:43.808
- [sobs]
- What about my child?

01:34:44.809 --> 01:34:46.855
- He didn't save him.
- [exclaims]

01:34:50.467 --> 01:34:51.555
Sister Yulia: [yells]

01:34:58.431 --> 01:34:59.737
Fox, stop!

01:35:09.181 --> 01:35:10.705
I think we were chosen.

01:35:14.012 --> 01:35:15.448
Like Mary and Joseph.

01:35:19.888 --> 01:35:21.890
I think we are
meant to be a family.

01:35:23.935 --> 01:35:26.938
[thunder roaring]

01:35:27.112 --> 01:35:29.245
Sister Yulia: Fox! No!

01:35:36.339 --> 01:35:37.383
Fox!

01:35:51.397 --> 01:35:54.661
[pants, cries]

01:36:18.424 --> 01:36:21.123
[solemn music playing]

01:36:25.518 --> 01:36:27.042
[breathes shakily]

01:36:27.738 --> 01:36:34.397
[praying in Russian]

01:36:40.577 --> 01:36:42.231
[sobbing]

01:36:48.585 --> 01:36:54.417
[praying in Russian, sobs]

01:37:06.124 --> 01:37:07.952
[praying in Russian]

01:37:09.127 --> 01:37:12.478
[sobbing,
continues praying in Russian]

01:37:20.443 --> 01:37:21.792
Amen.

01:37:24.447 --> 01:37:26.057
[sobs]

01:37:29.495 --> 01:37:32.194
[uplifting music playing]

01:37:51.648 --> 01:37:54.651
Sister Yulia:
God has chosen to become man.

01:37:58.655 --> 01:38:03.965
To suffer the same desires
and temptations as all men do.

01:38:07.098 --> 01:38:10.885
He too will learn
how to love true suffering.

01:38:14.758 --> 01:38:16.847
It is up to us to guide him...

01:38:20.111 --> 01:38:22.548
and to make sure
that he is prepared

01:38:22.722 --> 01:38:24.289
to fight his brother.

01:38:53.753 --> 01:38:55.799
We are not meant
to know the why.

01:38:58.758 --> 01:39:00.630
Love is the only way forward.

01:39:22.391 --> 01:39:25.176
[solemn music playing]

01:43:26.504 --> 01:43:28.289
[music concludes]
