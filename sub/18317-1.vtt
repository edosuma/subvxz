and you can phone home,
or whatever.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.270
No, no, no, Max. Listen, you
are gonna be generating

30:28.360 --> 30:31.280
that tachyon energy for the rest of
your life. And that is all that I eat.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.675

actually starve to death.

Okay. Well, how about
the energy? The tachyon stuff.

30:48.720 --> 30:49.976
Let's start with that.
Sounds good. Let's do it.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Where did it come from?

30:51.040 --> 30:53.076
Uh, pass.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.640
Did you do this to me?

30:54.720 --> 30:56.153
No, I think
you did this to me.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.440
You woke me up.
I was sleeping.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.480
Is it gonna kill me?

30:58.560 --> 30:59.754
Yes! If I'm not around.

how lucky you were

31:01.560 --> 31:02.595
that I was there
yesterday

31:02.680 --> 31:04.280
to relieve you of
your excesses in energy

31:04.320 --> 31:05.833
'cause you were
about to explode.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.751
Explode. Right. I got it.
Jinx.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.736
So, what? You're like some
kind of a space vampire then?

31:10.760 --> 31:12.671
More like your space buddy.
Whoa. Heads up.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.871
Excuse me,
Max, why are we hiding?

31:25.360 --> 31:26.839
Because you're an alien.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.576
They're gonna, like,
dissect you, or something.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.910
Dissect. To cut open
a deceased organism for study.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.281
But, Max, that doesn't make
sense 'cause I'm not deceased.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.112
Good job, Max.
Now, watch this.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.231

No, don't, no.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.656
Oh, come on. You have to
remember something.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.433
I don't know. I told you
everything I remember.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.878
I saw a reflection of you.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.396
I was you.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.948
It was your memory. Why would
I see one of your memories?

32:54.040 --> 32:55.917
See? I told you.
We are linked.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.592
I feel like you're not
listening to me.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.296
I heard a voice that
said something about...

32:59.320 --> 33:00.776
I keep repeating myself.
It's getting old.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.438
Ultralinks?
Is that what you are?

33:02.520 --> 33:05.956
Ultralinks? No!
Max, those are very dangerous.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.476
They destroy worlds.
They destroy everything. They don't...

33:09.560 --> 33:12.120
They're coming. Okay, we
have to get out of here.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.240
I can't go home.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.753
Uh-huh.
Because you fear "my mom."

33:15.840 --> 33:18.274
No, because guys with
guns are chasing us.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.136
And because you
would freak her out.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.309
Max, harsh.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.870
We have to go somewhere
where they wouldn't attack us.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.554
(MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

33:27.640 --> 33:29.471
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.075
Hey.
STEEL: Hey.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.760
Ow!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.176
Don't, you can't do that.
Just being friendly.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.376
Look, nobody can see you. Do you
remember the whole dissect thing?

33:38.400 --> 33:39.435
That I do remember.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.999
You have to be cool.
You understand?

33:41.120 --> 33:43.350
I understand. But I cannot
control my temperature.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.112
Ow!
I'm going to jail.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.400
STEEL: As long
as I'm with you.

33:46.800 --> 33:51.396
MS. BERNARDO: The integral measures the area
of the curve from point 'A' to point 'B'.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.870
Copy these equations down,
this is all going to be on the final.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.552
STEEL: The equations
are lies, Max!

33:56.680 --> 33:58.656
This creature has no idea
what they're talking about.

33:58.680 --> 33:59.908
Don't trust it.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.112
I left my iPod on.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.838

Don't lie. (GRUNTS)

Are you crazy?

34:13.159 --> 34:14.840
STEEL: (GASPS)
We've been attacked! Let go.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.039
What'd you say to me?

34:17.320 --> 34:21.154
I, uh, said
my backpack is heavy.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.591
Stupid books. Am I right?

34:25.840 --> 34:27.034
Freak.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.917
STEEL: See, Max? I protected you.
Whoa! Incoming.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.034
Max?

34:32.120 --> 34:33.120
Sofia.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.114
What happened to you yesterday?
You okay?

34:36.440 --> 34:40.069
Yeah. Yeah. I'm so sorry that
I ran out on you like that.

34:40.159 --> 34:44.152
My head just, um...
It felt like it was going to explode.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.559
It was the boba, wasn't it?

34:45.639 --> 34:46.789
No, I just...

34:46.880 --> 34:49.520
I didn't want to leave you with the
impression that I was too cool.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.318
But, uh, maybe I could
make it up to you?

34:52.520 --> 34:55.876
Yeah? And just how
do you intend to do that?

34:55.960 --> 34:57.837
Uh...
STEEL: Okay, this is boring.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.536
Are you sure you're okay?
STEEL: It's cramped in here.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.232
Yeah, I just...
STEEL: Come on, buddy.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.312
Maybe we can talk
about this later. I have to run.

35:05.400 --> 35:09.632
I'm really late
for my Zumba class.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.320
(CHUCKLES)

35:13.880 --> 35:15.096
STEEL: The girl creature
appears to cause

35:15.120 --> 35:17.236
increases in heart
rate and respiration.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.311
Perhaps you should
avoid contact with her.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.719
Perhaps you should shut up.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.279
STEEL: See?
She has made you angry.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.556
Okay, we should be good here.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.313
STEEL: I don't know, Max.
It seems like that girl creature

35:36.400 --> 35:39.392
must have put out some kind
of mind control virus on you.

35:39.480 --> 35:40.754
We should probably kill her.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.957
What? No.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.759
And her name is Sofia,
by the way. She's...

35:47.480 --> 35:50.358
She's a cyborg.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.509
She's, uh...

35:51.600 --> 35:55.559
She's a war machine. A snail. An alien!
No, no, I'm an alien.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.073
She's not dangerous.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.559
Okay, okay.
Agree to disagree.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.313
What are we gonna do, Steel?
We can't stay here all day.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.358
Well, yeah, but perhaps
"my mom" can help us.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.634
You claim she's an ally.

36:05.720 --> 36:06.776
No, I can't dump this on her.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.840
All my life, she's been like
insane about my health.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.148
Taking me to
all these doctors.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.496
If she knew what was
happening, she'd...

36:11.520 --> 36:12.953
Oh! Excuse me one second.

36:14.480 --> 36:15.515
Will you cut that out!

36:15.600 --> 36:16.635
STEEL: No, it's okay.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.029
No, I will not cut it out.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.759
When you get worked up,
you generate energy.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.035
Clearly, "my mom"
makes you upset.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.438
No, she's just...

36:28.520 --> 36:29.999
It just sucks.
What?

36:30.080 --> 36:31.638
Everything that
happened with my dad,

36:31.720 --> 36:33.296
she just kept moving us
from place to place.

36:33.320 --> 36:37.438
Yeah. I know.
Yeah, no, I get it, right.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.717
What's up?
Why am I telling you this?

36:41.800 --> 36:45.076
Because I'm here for you, Max.
I'm here to protect you.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.230
Which means
you can tell me anything.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.949
Max?

36:52.760 --> 36:55.274
You know, sometimes I just
wish my dad was still here.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.477
That I could,
I don't know, talk to him,

37:03.120 --> 37:05.475
or even know what
his laugh sounded like.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.032
I don't even know him,
but I miss him.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.319
I understand.

37:17.120 --> 37:21.477
I don't even know where my
home is, but I miss it, too.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.029
Right.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.834
I'm sorry.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.479
Nah, it's coolio. I was just kind
of going off your vibe anyway.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.136
Although it could
help if you could

37:35.160 --> 37:36.416
remember who was
trying to kill you.

37:36.440 --> 37:37.873
Hey, us.
You.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.856
All right, look, if you can just
remember something, I don't know.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.793
Maybe more from the memory
that we saw, it might help us.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.720
Um...
Here. Max, look.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.836
What, this?
You remember N-Tek?

38:02.920 --> 38:05.229
They attacked it.
They will come for us.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.788
Wait, what?
The guys in the black vans?

38:07.880 --> 38:09.757
No, the Ultralinks.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.832
They always come for us.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.115
Come on.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.671
Uh, just... No trespassing.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.760
Seriously?

38:28.840 --> 38:31.593

Max, wait. Okay.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.713
(WATER DRIPPING)

39:09.040 --> 39:11.508
Okay, so, if you don't
remember any details,

39:11.600 --> 39:13.216
how do we trigger
that memory thing that we had?

39:13.240 --> 39:15.160
Does anything around here
remind you of anything?

39:15.240 --> 39:16.240
STEEL: Yes!

39:16.320 --> 39:17.912
What?

39:18.040 --> 39:21.112
No, you go and then I'll go.
I thought you had something.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.031
Steel, come on.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.314
Oh! Don't move. I got you.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.469
No, Steel, wait, no!

39:28.560 --> 39:30.471
Will you stop!

39:30.560 --> 39:32.994
Nah, I'm probably
gonna keep doing it.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.434
How did you do that?

39:43.560 --> 39:45.232
I didn't. We did.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.040
I've been telling you,
if we work together,

39:47.080 --> 39:48.718
we can
harmonize tachyon energy

39:48.800 --> 39:53.874
so that it becomes far-cart-tar...
Turbo energy!

39:53.960 --> 39:56.838
Turbo? Really?

39:56.920 --> 39:58.911
Yes. Yes. It's very powerful.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.076
The energy can enhance
your physical attributes.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.160
Like how?

40:02.240 --> 40:03.912
STEEL: Try moving.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.037
Yes, that's very funny,
but fast.

Whoa!

40:19.640 --> 40:22.837
Whoa, did you see that?
That was incredible!

40:22.920 --> 40:25.036
Not bad.
Try something else.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.359
That's impressive.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.795
But, Max, do you know
what's even more impressive?

40:33.880 --> 40:35.871
My knowledge of
battle strategy.

40:35.960 --> 40:39.396
I have memorized volumes
upon volumes of extensive...

40:41.760 --> 40:42.829

the strategy part later.

have been the night he died?

knew you, an alien,

you were attacked

a wind-monster thing.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.712
Actually, Max,
it's super, super scary.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.416
See, Ultralinks can
manipulate the elements.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.616
Air and wind and fire... So, that
night wasn't an accident at all.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.880
They can control air itself
to create storms or tornados,

44:01.920 --> 44:04.036

but also like...

44:04.160 --> 44:05.354

Okay. We need some
kind of, like, a plan.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.080
Okay. Time to suit up.

You don't like the suit?

44:51.840 --> 44:53.068
We have to like split up.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.232
Okay, if you can send them on like
a wild goose chase, or something,

44:56.320 --> 44:58.072
then I can head to
N-Tek and talk to Miles.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.035
I must protect you, Max.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.155

knowledge of battle strategy?

You should come with me.
What?

Uh, I'm super lost and I don't
really know where I'm going, but...

45:30.280 --> 45:31.416
Where?

45:31.440 --> 45:32.640

would be a big deal, but...

47:19.560 --> 47:22.028

that's what you're saying.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.315

We're just trying to build
upon Max's father's work.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.115
You know, when I first
met Jim 20 years ago,

48:38.200 --> 48:40.350
he had such
a contagious energy.

48:40.440 --> 48:41.668
It was inspiring.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.320
I feel, uh...

48:43.800 --> 48:45.791
I feel lucky to have
had him for a partner

48:45.880 --> 48:48.952
even if it was for
too short a time.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.913
Hey, can I talk to you?
Can we go somewhere?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.149
Of course.

48:58.640 --> 49:01.916
Go ahead. Have a seat.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.536
Um, listen, I don't... I just need
to ask you one quick question.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.152
Yeah. Have a seat.
No, no, I just...

49:06.240 --> 49:07.760
Listen, I need to
ask you about my dad.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.456
What exactly happened
the night that he died?

49:10.480 --> 49:11.549

49:13.880 --> 49:15.233
It's really not my place.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.912

49:17.000 --> 49:18.194
I need to know.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.149
Well, by the time I got there,
everything was gone.

49:25.680 --> 49:29.070
And your father, he...

49:29.440 --> 49:30.839
How should I say this?

49:33.920 --> 49:35.273
Let me show you something.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.751
You see this?

49:37.840 --> 49:38.840
What is it?

49:38.880 --> 49:41.189
It's a miniature
prototype of a power core.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.350
It's a device that's capable
of harnessing energy

49:43.440 --> 49:46.432
beyond anything that mankind
has ever attempted.

49:46.720 --> 49:49.439
This was your father's dream.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.474
So, then what happened?

49:51.560 --> 49:53.994
Listen, your father was a dear
friend and a true genius,

49:54.080 --> 49:58.710
but sometimes he tended to...
To leap before he looked.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.976
And the energy that
he was playing with...

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Wait. Wait.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.336
I don't understand,
what are you saying?

50:03.360 --> 50:04.576
That the accident
was his fault?

50:04.600 --> 50:07.398
No, what I'm saying is that
sometimes we all have a tendency

50:07.480 --> 50:10.472
to reach a little bit
too far for what we want.

borrowed my phone and my car,

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.759
STEEL: Wait, what? Oh,
actually, that's really smart.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.275
There's no one here
to save you. Come out.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.270
Steel, will we survive it?

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.553
STEEL: I don't know, Max.

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.352
Ah! There's my boy.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.950
Now, you can be smart,
or you can be dead.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.714
I chose smart, your
father chose differently.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.631
What about you, Max?

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.674
Well, I guess I have more in
common with my dad than I thought.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.240
(GRUNTS)

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.080
(GRUNTS)

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.316
You're just as
arrogant as your father.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.113
You want the power,
then take it.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.958
Steel, now! Go turbo!

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.519
STEEL: You got it, Max!

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.673
You idiot. You're giving
me everything I need.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.269
You sure?

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.557
Because when I have too much
energy, I kind of explode.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.878
This is for my father.

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.439
(SCREAMING)

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:50.879
(SCREAMING)

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.592
(WATER DRIPPING)

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.275
Hey.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.515
Steel.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.920
Hey.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.235
Steel, come on, please. Hey.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760
Please.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.591
You have to be okay.
I can't lose you, come on.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.719
(GROANS) Ow!
(CHUCKLES)

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.517
(COUGHS)

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:54.513
See, Max,
we have fun together.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.674
I still think
the armor feels weird.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.832
I think it's all right.
We're like nesting dolls.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:03.920
(LAUGHS)

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.194
AGENT: Clear.
There! Right here!

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.395
Now what?

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.629
Can you get up?

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.638
No. You?

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.313
No.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.078
AGENT: D-06.
Secure the perimeter.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.390
What do we do?

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.391
Let's hope
they're friendly.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.799
MOLLY: Max!

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.029
Max.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.233
Mom?
Max, are you okay?

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.833
STEEL: Careful steps,
careful steps.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.114
Yeah.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.553
Hey, I wanna
introduce you to somebody.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.313
Steel, you're alive.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.235
Hi, Molly.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.313
We have a lot to talk about.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.389
(CHUCKLES)
You totally married an alien.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.873
Hey, what's wrong
with that?

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.477
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.200
MOLLY: The night your father died,
I didn't know what to do.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:12.514
The whole town thought it was
an accident, a freak storm.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.558
But I knew the Ultralinks
had come for them

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.756
and I was afraid
they would come for you, too.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.593
So, I did the only thing I
could think of to protect you.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:24.674
I ran. To different towns,
different doctors.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.239
'Cause I didn't know if you
would blow up, or something.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.029
I should have told you.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.229
But I thought you were
too young to understand.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.993
And believe me,
I never suspected Miles.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.275
Yeah, just 16 years in a tank, Molly.
No big deal.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.070
MOLLY: I said
I'm sorry, Steel.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.496
If I had known
you were still alive,

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.216
you know I would have
never let that happen.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.152
I would have kicked anyone's
butt who tried to hurt you.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.429
STEEL: Aw!

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.753
So, it was Miles who suggested
we come back to Copper Canyon

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.195
in case the energy
manifested in you.

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.071
I was trying to help you.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.678
And instead,
I almost got you killed.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.192
I spent so many years
trying to hide this from you.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.913
'Cause I was afraid
you'd end up like your dad.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.758
But now I couldn't be
prouder that you did.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.475
What's your name?

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.354
So, are there more
Ultralinks out there?

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.556
Yes.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.552
Why do you think
I watch the stars so much?

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.754
Why haven't they come for me?

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.029
I don't know.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.509
Maybe because
you didn't have the power yet.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.910
But you're a threat now
and they'll come for you.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.559
I thought I could
protect you, but I can't.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.155
You know you're not exactly
making me feel any better.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.558
But I do know
one thing, okay?

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.631
You will not have
to do this alone.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.389
I love you, bud.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.072
I love you, too, Mom.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:18.920
Hey.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.791
I've held on to
this for too long.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.830
Now it belongs to you.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.309
I don't understand.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.279
You will.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.039
Steel.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.354
Show me.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.552
He'll need to know where he
came from to know who he is.

Hey.

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.515
You're okay.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.431
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.154
Where have you been?

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.576
Uh, it's kind of
a crazy story.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.635
Try me.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.599
Listen, um...

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.269
I just came by to let you know
that you were right about me.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.435
I'm used to being alone and I'm
actually pretty good at it.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.235
Um, when I moved here,

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.456
I thought that
this was just gonna be

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.994
like every other
town I've lived in.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.993
And then you showed up.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.032
Uh, thank you for noticing me.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.197
What's this?

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280
Open it.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.869
Uh, there.

Uh-huh.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.350
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Uh, maybe
we could, I don't know,

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.355
go on that tour that you were
talking about in the car.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.794
How's tonight?

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.110
Yeah, only if you
don't bail on me.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.269
Never. Right.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360
Right. Uh-huh.

Okay.

Oh, wow.

STEEL: Okay, maybe it was
good we didn't kill her.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.073
Yeah, you think?

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.148
Flight mode?

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.389
Flight mode.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:34.948
I like flight mode.

MAX: (GROANS) Steel, this suit
seems tighter than usual.

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.856
Really? We're flying and you're
complaining about the suit?

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.313
MAX: Go right.
STEEL: Let's go left.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.400
MAX: No. Let's go right.

your other right?

Let's just go straight then.
