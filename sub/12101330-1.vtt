19:41.870 --> 19:46.392
Wow! Why were you listening
to your high school bullshit?

19:46.426 --> 19:48.601
- OK, OK, no. No.
- That's so weird.

19:48.635 --> 19:53.675
This was circa me
being 20, 21, I think,

19:53.709 --> 19:55.539
- so not high school bullshit.
- Oh, far more mature.

19:55.573 --> 19:59.439
And for your information, I was
not listening to my own shit,

19:59.474 --> 20:02.442
I... it happened to be on.

20:02.477 --> 20:04.686
I haven't driven this car
in like, ten years, so...

20:04.720 --> 20:08.966
Yeah. What happened
to your suburban dad car?

20:09.000 --> 20:12.245
Um... I don't...

20:12.280 --> 20:14.454
- Did you total it?

What do you mean?
Is it like, gone?

20:19.977 --> 20:22.600
I mean that somebody else
is driving it

20:22.635 --> 20:25.534
and they need it
more than I do

20:25.569 --> 20:28.951

with the B-wheels.

was my favorite song of yours.

[Virginia] Do you remember
after all your shows

21:03.710 --> 21:05.574
you'd get on this like,

21:05.609 --> 21:07.921
"Let's just,
let's just steal some shit."

21:07.956 --> 21:10.338
That made me so uncomfortable.

21:10.372 --> 21:13.824
But I kind of loved it.

21:13.858 --> 21:17.414
I remember this one time like,
Mom was on a health kick

cos... I don't know, Dad's
cholesterol or something stupid

let us have sodas, you know?

you stole one for me.

21:34.741 --> 21:38.849
Uh... for your information,
I stole in bulk.

21:38.883 --> 21:41.058
I stole a six-pack. I just
gave 'em to you one at a time.

21:45.821 --> 21:48.514
Just like, whenever
you would steal shit for me,

21:48.548 --> 21:50.067
it just made me feel like...

21:51.724 --> 21:55.969
...like you got my back,
you care for me, you know, like?

21:57.039 --> 21:59.525

No, it's... that's sweet.

- No.

22:08.050 --> 22:10.674
Unless you stole this outfit
from J.Crew.

22:10.708 --> 22:13.884

that I could be,

around you, and it's funny.

the ice rink a time or two.

exactly a lot of time to plan.

1:10:35.023 --> 1:10:38.786
- There's no one here.
- Yep.

1:10:45.586 --> 1:10:48.761
- Do you still feel them?
- No.

1:11:01.567 --> 1:11:04.329
[Virginia exhales deeply]

1:11:04.363 --> 1:11:06.400
We gotta keep looking.

1:11:07.746 --> 1:11:09.437
- Leo...
- No, we gotta keep looking.

1:11:09.472 --> 1:11:11.301
- No.
- He's out there somewhere.

1:11:11.336 --> 1:11:13.303
- He's not real.
- No, no.

1:11:13.338 --> 1:11:14.994
I made him up.

1:11:17.652 --> 1:11:21.346
I need help, and that's OK.
I just need help.

1:11:22.726 --> 1:11:26.765
I have seen things
that cannot explain...

1:11:28.974 --> 1:11:32.736
I've seen you feel things
and do things that...

1:11:32.771 --> 1:11:34.945
that are just not you.

1:11:36.947 --> 1:11:40.710
You are not crazy,

1:11:40.744 --> 1:11:43.782
because if you are
then I am too and, ah...

1:11:47.406 --> 1:11:49.926
...I can't afford to be crazy.

1:11:51.928 --> 1:11:54.033

[♪ Soft synth music]

1:12:06.494 --> 1:12:07.875
OK.

1:12:27.446 --> 1:12:30.760
What are the odds
he's in Cancun?

1:12:30.794 --> 1:12:33.970
- I'd say they're pretty good.
- I think so.

1:12:34.004 --> 1:12:35.972
If it's not there,
maybe he went to the Bahamas.

1:12:36.006 --> 1:12:38.733
[Virginia] Hmm!

1:12:38.768 --> 1:12:42.599
Maybe he's always wanted to go
to Paris, or... I don't know.

1:12:42.634 --> 1:12:44.601
I hear Italy's lovely
this time of year.

1:12:44.636 --> 1:12:45.844
Mmm, he's a very cultured man.

1:12:45.878 --> 1:12:47.673
Seems like a drinker.
Maybe he likes wine.

1:12:47.708 --> 1:12:50.435
[Virginia chuckles]

1:12:50.469 --> 1:12:51.781
You got enough real estate
on your arm?

1:12:51.815 --> 1:12:53.127
Maybe we just carve in
your phone number and...

1:12:53.161 --> 1:12:55.854
Fuck you, fuck you.
You know what?

1:12:55.888 --> 1:12:59.513
Maybe... maybe he'll just learn
how to morse code, you know?

1:12:59.547 --> 1:13:01.687
- Oh, you guys share gas?

Virginia?
Come on, come on, come on.

1:14:18.523 --> 1:14:20.179
Wake up, wake up,
I think he's dead.

1:14:20.214 --> 1:14:21.526

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:30.707
- Why... why did you come here?
- You brought me here.

1:14:31.674 --> 1:14:33.745
Why did you bring me here?

1:14:33.779 --> 1:14:36.748
You told me to,
you brought me here.

1:14:36.782 --> 1:14:38.750

Why? Why me?
