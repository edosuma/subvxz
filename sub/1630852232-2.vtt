a small stove.

I go to sleep cold,
I wake up cold,

00:46.805 --> 00:49.946

warms me up for ten minutes

inside of it and heat it up.

ice down inside of it so, um,

05:43.584 --> 05:47.416
what's going on is the
snow's getting up inside
the cowling over here,

05:47.485 --> 05:48.900
into my air-intake,

05:48.969 --> 05:51.627
inside my airbox is
full of snow.

05:51.696 --> 05:54.319
Which is then going
right into my carburetor.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.563
JESSI: How do you get
the snow out of this box?

05:56.632 --> 05:58.427
CHRIS: Well, I took all of
this apart, but I can't.

05:58.496 --> 06:00.290
There's no way of getting
down inside of there so,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.362

keep ingesting snow unless

06:02.431 --> 06:04.571
I take the time
to like thaw this out.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.814
I don't have a shop out
here to stick it in,

06:06.883 --> 06:08.989
so what I was thinking is,
we gotta figure out how to

06:09.058 --> 06:11.163
get maybe the stove
out of the bathhouse,

06:11.232 --> 06:13.649
and we can lift this thing up,
you know, two, three,

06:13.718 --> 06:16.203
four feet off the ground,
and then we can build a fire

06:16.272 --> 06:17.756
underneath it
with a fireplace.

06:17.825 --> 06:19.655
Um, I don't know.

06:19.724 --> 06:21.346
I just gotta thaw
this thing out.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.072
I feel like I'm gonna
do more damage to it if I

06:23.141 --> 06:24.384
just keep running it.

learn to appreciate this place.

wicked fisherman.

She might catch
the biggest one.

and I went out and caught

07:17.678 --> 07:19.508
a lot of fish at Long Lake,

07:19.577 --> 07:21.855
there's the
spawning grounds there.

07:21.924 --> 07:23.857
The salmon, run to
that spawning grounds.

07:23.926 --> 07:26.135
They lay their eggs
and Dolly Varden's main food

07:26.204 --> 07:28.137
supply is salmon eggs.

07:29.414 --> 07:31.934

holes here from where we

08:12.492 --> 08:16.254
successfully fished last time,
and I'm thinking we just put

08:16.323 --> 08:19.153
holes in the same spots,
and we'll catch fish again.

08:19.222 --> 08:20.465
BRITTANY: Awesome.

08:20.534 --> 08:24.262
All right kids, it's
great to watch but just,

08:24.331 --> 08:28.197
he's gonna throw water up
so watch out for the water.

08:46.595 --> 08:47.941
KALEB: There, now we
can fish this hole.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.080

get my fishing poles out.

08:58.745 --> 09:00.643
JOHNNY: You know,
if it's negative 30, 40, 50

09:00.712 --> 09:03.301
even 60 below zero,

09:03.370 --> 09:06.166
I face danger at finding
resources out here.

09:07.408 --> 09:08.824
JOHNNY: That's
a huge danger to me.

09:14.277 --> 09:19.420
Just try to expose
the surface of the ice.

09:19.489 --> 09:22.009
And that way I can start
chipping down to the ice to

09:22.078 --> 09:24.356
access the water.

09:24.425 --> 09:25.806
Out here I don't
have running water,

09:25.875 --> 09:28.326
I have what I call
walking water, which is:

09:28.395 --> 09:30.742
grab a bucket,
walk down to the lake about a

09:30.811 --> 09:32.364
half-mile away,

09:32.433 --> 09:34.850
chip a hole in the ice,
fill it with water,

09:34.919 --> 09:36.472
and walk back up to the cabin.

09:38.094 --> 09:40.856
A task I gotta do every day
out here for a basic necessity

09:40.925 --> 09:43.134
which is water.

09:45.826 --> 09:48.622
This process gets
a little warm.

09:48.691 --> 09:51.452
The last thing I wanna do
is start working up a sweat.

10:03.154 --> 10:06.329
You know one of the big
motivations for coming out, uh,

10:06.398 --> 10:10.230
to the Brooks Range is to
be completely self-reliant,

10:10.299 --> 10:13.095
and honestly there's
no other option out here.

10:16.546 --> 10:18.410
I have to get it
myself if I want water,

10:18.479 --> 10:19.791
if I don't,

10:19.860 --> 10:22.276
then I don't get water
and I'm not gonna make it.

10:29.076 --> 10:32.632
You can feel that cold
anytime you breathe in.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.291
It's like frosting
over my lungs.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.675
It was about negative 50
when I woke up this morning so

10:41.744 --> 10:43.332
anytime you take a breath
it just kinda crystalizes

10:43.401 --> 10:45.506
on your lungs.

10:48.924 --> 10:51.892
To chip the hole completely down
to the surface of the water,

10:51.961 --> 10:54.757
it takes about 25 minutes,

10:54.826 --> 10:57.104
and doing physical work
in these extreme cold

10:57.173 --> 11:01.005
temperatures is definitely
tolling on the body.

11:01.074 --> 11:03.939
I can feel the
onset of frostbite,

11:04.008 --> 11:05.112
and you gotta keep going.

11:05.181 --> 11:07.045
You gotta keep pushing.

I can't go any further.

11:42.529 --> 11:45.394
It's frozen all the way
to the bottom of the lake.

No water's coming up.

I needed to go much further.

11:59.339 --> 12:00.650
You can't look at
things as failures.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.757
You've gotta look
at them as growth.

12:03.826 --> 12:06.311
It takes a lot of mental
stamina to live this lifestyle.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.730
Onward I go.

12:19.497 --> 12:20.740
It looks good.

12:25.227 --> 12:28.368
Living in Alaska I've
learned patience the most.

12:28.437 --> 12:30.819
Nothing comes fast,
nothing comes easy.

12:39.413 --> 12:41.381
All right, round two.

12:42.900 --> 12:48.043
[ice chipping]

12:48.112 --> 12:50.631
I've got a lotta
chipping to do.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.013
Just gotta work a little
bit harder for it.

12:56.258 --> 12:59.261
Nature provides the
best source of water.

13:01.021 --> 13:03.092
I could watch the snow melt
off the mountains of this

13:03.161 --> 13:06.095
spring and goes
right into this lake.

13:06.164 --> 13:09.581
Pure, natural, water
straight from the source.

13:24.217 --> 13:26.219
There it is.

13:26.288 --> 13:28.324
Water's coming up.

13:28.393 --> 13:30.361
That's awesome.

13:30.430 --> 13:34.779
Once you break through
the bottom of the ice,

13:34.848 --> 13:36.850
there's a suction and it
kinda pulls everything up

13:36.919 --> 13:39.473
from the bottom of the lake.

13:39.542 --> 13:42.200
Clean, healthy water.

13:47.309 --> 13:50.968
That's incredible, and now
that I've got this hole opened

13:51.037 --> 13:54.385
up it's a matter of hours
before it starts freezing up,

13:54.454 --> 13:57.353
and I'd like to start
working on an insulation, uh,

13:57.422 --> 13:59.217
plan for this.

13:59.286 --> 14:01.047
I think I'm gonna start using
spruce boughs and grab it from

14:01.116 --> 14:03.877
the trees all around here,
kind of bundle them up,

14:03.946 --> 14:07.122
lay 'em across the top, put
some of that snow on and I

14:07.191 --> 14:09.710
think that'll be enough
to insulate this hole.

14:12.541 --> 14:17.580
The purpose for insulating the
ice hole is to prevent it from

14:17.649 --> 14:22.309
freezing up all the way, so I
don't have to come back out,

14:22.378 --> 14:25.381
chip the hole all the way
down to the bottom again.

14:28.522 --> 14:31.146
JOHNNY: Use what
nature uses to, uh,

14:31.215 --> 14:35.219
insulate herself and
see if I can do that.

14:35.288 --> 14:39.740
Okay. Huh.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.024
It's already frozen over.

14:47.093 --> 14:48.404
That's how cold
it is out here,

14:48.473 --> 14:50.475
and this is a perfect
example of why I would

14:50.544 --> 14:52.650
like to insulate this.

14:52.719 --> 14:54.479
Yeah, every hour I'm gone
is at least another inch

14:54.548 --> 14:56.550
that this freezes up.

14:57.966 --> 14:59.208
I like to problem solve.

14:59.277 --> 15:01.141
I like to try new things.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.385
I'm hoping that the spruce
boughs work because they're

15:03.454 --> 15:06.906
easy to get around here,
so renewable resource.

15:08.528 --> 15:11.013
And I think that the snow
is also gonna help a lot,

15:11.082 --> 15:14.361
'cause I know that snow does
have insulating properties.

15:17.295 --> 15:23.094
The sorta hope is to come
back tomorrow, remove this,

15:23.163 --> 15:24.924
and chip through the ice,
and if it only takes about a

15:24.993 --> 15:27.029
minute to get through
then success, and, uh,

15:27.098 --> 15:28.548
I don't have to
worry about, uh,

15:28.617 --> 15:32.483
chipping all the way down to
the bottom of the ice anymore.

15:32.552 --> 15:35.865
Come back first thing in
the morning and assess it.

15:39.076 --> 15:42.079
JESSI: Mother nature
can be a really crazy lady.

15:42.148 --> 15:44.150
The weather is
constantly changing.

15:44.219 --> 15:46.428
It's constantly shifting.

15:46.497 --> 15:49.741
Strange things happen
especially out at the Cosna.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.923
CHRIS: Cool.
Got one on there.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.305
JESSI: Chris and I are gonna
have to thaw out the Snow-Go.

16:01.374 --> 16:03.134
CHRIS: Do another one.

16:03.203 --> 16:05.585
JESSI: Right now, we
can't steer and everything's

16:05.654 --> 16:07.794
kind of encased in ice.

16:07.863 --> 16:11.004
So, we need to be able to
hoist the entire Snow-Go up in

16:11.073 --> 16:16.389
the air and put a small camp
stove underneath the Snow-Go.

16:22.498 --> 16:25.536
CHRIS: Okay, so I'm
gonna go loop the rope up

16:25.605 --> 16:27.987
through the pulleys and
then down to the machine.

16:29.678 --> 16:31.438
JESSI: This Snow-Go is
really precious to us.

16:31.507 --> 16:33.613
We use the Snow-Go
for everything.

16:33.682 --> 16:35.891
So, we really need it working.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.135
CHRIS: This is a funky old rope.

16:39.377 --> 16:43.071
Okay. I'm going to
take down the ladder.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.073
I'm just gonna try this
pulley out real quick.

16:48.455 --> 16:49.905
Ooh, that tree huh?

16:49.974 --> 16:52.011
JESSI: It's a rot tree.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.082
CHRIS: It's definitely
rotten in the middle.

16:54.151 --> 16:55.600
I hope it holds.

16:55.669 --> 16:57.361
I guess we're gonna find out.

16:59.156 --> 17:00.329
All right so Jess,
I'm gonna lift it up.

17:00.398 --> 17:01.710
You're gonna help.

17:01.779 --> 17:02.952
Then I'm gonna pause
for just a second while

17:03.022 --> 17:04.471
you're holding that.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.714
I'm gonna reach underneath,
grab ahold of the track and

17:05.783 --> 17:07.164
I'm gonna heave it up again,

17:07.233 --> 17:09.338
and I want you to just try
to hook that on there, okay?

17:09.407 --> 17:12.962
JESSI: Okay.
CHRIS: Ready?
JESSI: Oh my gosh.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.343
CHRIS: Ready?

17:14.412 --> 17:20.073
JESSI: Yup.
We need a little bit more.

17:20.142 --> 17:22.317
CHRIS: And...
JESSI: Almost!

17:22.386 --> 17:24.871
CHRIS: Hang on. Okay! Oh!

17:28.426 --> 17:29.945
CHRIS: Okay! Oh!

17:30.014 --> 17:31.084
[thud]

17:31.153 --> 17:34.260
JESSI: Oh gosh.
We were so close.

17:34.329 --> 17:41.301
CHRIS: Let's try it again,
and up, and up, all right pull.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.237
JESSI: That's it.

17:52.347 --> 17:53.589
CHRIS: So far so good.

17:53.658 --> 17:57.697
Okay. Now, let's work
on the front one, huh?

17:57.766 --> 18:00.838
JESSI: Chris, we have made
some janky stuff in our life,

18:00.907 --> 18:03.289
but this is at the top
of that list, I think.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.430
CHRIS: We'll just try.

18:06.499 --> 18:10.572
JESSI: I think we
should get some stumps.

18:10.641 --> 18:12.815
CHRIS: Just hang out in case
it falls on me or something.

18:14.748 --> 18:16.819
It's lifting. I'm stoked.

18:25.518 --> 18:27.727
Okay. That's as
high as we can get it,

18:27.796 --> 18:29.349
but let's just go get
the wood stove and try and

18:29.418 --> 18:30.695
put it in place.

18:30.764 --> 18:31.903
JESSI: Let's do it.

18:35.735 --> 18:36.874
CHRIS: Hold that for me.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.259
Piece one.

18:42.328 --> 18:47.988
JESSI: Piece one.
CHRIS: Piece two.
JESSI: Piece two. Piece three.

18:54.616 --> 18:58.171
CHRIS: Maybe I can stick
the butt-end out that side.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.663
Okay.
So, let's get a tarp, huh?

19:10.494 --> 19:12.289
JESSI: I would
call our contraption that we

19:12.358 --> 19:14.981
got going on here
like a tarp shanty.

19:15.050 --> 19:17.777
I think it's pretty janky.

19:17.846 --> 19:20.538
But, I trust Chris.
I think it's gonna work.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.402
We'll just see how it goes.

19:24.922 --> 19:26.751
CHRIS: This looks pretty good.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.891
JESSI: Hasn't fallen yet.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.721
CHRIS: I'm about ready to
start a small fire and see

19:30.790 --> 19:32.585
what we can get going.

19:34.621 --> 19:36.623
ALEX: In a fight
against the Alaskan winter,

19:36.692 --> 19:39.350
it's, it's not a fight
I can ever win.

19:39.419 --> 19:41.525
It's just kind of like being
surrounded by an enemy on all

19:41.594 --> 19:44.183
sides and the enemy's just
always coming in, crushing you.

19:46.012 --> 19:47.807
It's an Alaska winter,
it's, it sucks.

19:50.154 --> 19:51.845
What else can you say?

19:56.816 --> 19:58.300
It's time to set up my tent.

20:02.097 --> 20:06.274
This is the same kinda tent
gold miners and prospectors

20:06.343 --> 20:08.310
would live in.

20:08.379 --> 20:10.864
When they came up here
and defiled the land in

20:10.933 --> 20:13.039
search for gold.

20:17.630 --> 20:20.184
This part's pretty exciting.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.841
I'm starting to get
a sense that like wow,

20:21.910 --> 20:23.601
pretty soon I'm not gonna
have to be fighting the

20:23.670 --> 20:24.878
cold as much anymore.

20:24.947 --> 20:27.950
I'll be living more,
uh, comfortably.

20:32.748 --> 20:35.095
You know if I just lay this
thing on the ground as is,

20:35.164 --> 20:37.443
and walk inside, each time
I step the whole thing will,

20:37.512 --> 20:39.652
you know, scootch in.

20:39.721 --> 20:41.964
So, it's gotta be pulled
out and held tight.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.933
Uh, a sensible approach would
just be to use some heavy logs

20:45.002 --> 20:47.142
to get the floor staked out.

20:47.211 --> 20:50.249
So, I think it's time to cut
more logs with the axe then.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.048
I came out here to my
property at Deadman Lake,

20:57.117 --> 20:59.430
in one of the colder
parts of winter.

20:59.499 --> 21:02.261
I knew it'd be pretty rough.

21:02.330 --> 21:05.885
I survived a few days in
just a really basic camp

21:05.954 --> 21:07.818
in the backpacking tent.

21:09.371 --> 21:13.099
Got some real big
heavy logs here.

21:13.168 --> 21:15.895
Oh, yeah.

21:15.964 --> 21:18.069
I like a challenge and I
like a little bit of misery

21:18.138 --> 21:20.658
but being cold nonstop,
it just gets old.

21:26.699 --> 21:28.632
Now that won't move.

21:28.701 --> 21:30.496
Yeah, I think it's time
for the pole.

21:31.635 --> 21:33.878
It's just a matter of survival.

21:33.947 --> 21:36.950
I just wanna get that
thing up so I can get warm.

21:37.019 --> 21:39.298
That's all I care about,
is just getting warm.

21:42.128 --> 21:43.888
The, uh, the roof is pitched.

21:43.957 --> 21:46.201
Now I just gotta tie off all
these guidelines and that's

21:46.270 --> 21:47.927
what's gonna make it expand,

21:47.996 --> 21:50.550
and also give me
my space indoors.

21:50.619 --> 21:52.656
My main goal is just to
get into this thing tonight.

21:52.725 --> 21:54.899
It's gonna be
cooling down soon.

21:58.869 --> 22:00.491
Whoever said
haste makes waste,

22:00.560 --> 22:04.012
I don't think they ever dealt
with conditions like this.

22:04.081 --> 22:05.427
I'm out here
battling these elements,

22:05.496 --> 22:08.465
you know, it's just,
you gotta be scrappy you know?

22:12.883 --> 22:14.263
This is good enough.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.541
It's pitched.

22:15.610 --> 22:17.577
It's all sideways
and everything but, um,

22:17.646 --> 22:19.096
I'll be able to get
my stove in there.

22:19.165 --> 22:20.373
So that's the most
important thing.

22:20.442 --> 22:22.513
That's what's gonna
keep me warm tonight.

22:22.582 --> 22:24.343
It's about to be getting cold.

22:26.724 --> 22:29.762
I just gotta grab the wood
stove from my old camp.

22:29.831 --> 22:33.731
Bring it on down in my sled,
get it inside the tent.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.424
This is where it's gonna live.

22:36.493 --> 22:38.667
And the final thing
I gotta do is cut the hole

22:38.736 --> 22:41.394
for the
chimney pipe to go through.

22:41.463 --> 22:44.846
Fingers crossed it doesn't
get crazy windy tonight.

22:44.915 --> 22:46.848
Just bring in
the bare minimum stuff,

22:46.917 --> 22:49.057
just to keep me warm.

22:52.025 --> 22:53.475
I'll get a fire going in here.

22:53.544 --> 22:56.098
Put my pot right
next to the stove.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.963
Tonight's just about getting
through the night, staying warm.

23:03.589 --> 23:05.729
BRITTANY: When living out
here you definitely learn to

23:05.798 --> 23:09.215
prioritize schooling,
such as survival,

23:09.284 --> 23:13.150
and how to do things
outdoors safely.

23:13.219 --> 23:16.015
When you live rurally,
you have to teach them.

23:16.084 --> 23:17.499
It is not a choice.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.710
KALEB: You've been so
excited to do this.

23:21.779 --> 23:23.056
ELOVIE: I don't have.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.127
KALEB: That it's time we
actually get to do it.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.267
A little less aggressive or
you'll never catch a fish.

23:27.336 --> 23:29.097
Okay, watch.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.409
You let it soak down,

23:30.478 --> 23:32.963
and you let it kinda
hang for a little bit.

23:33.032 --> 23:35.690
Then you jerk it, but you
gotta be able to let the fish

23:35.759 --> 23:39.245
come to the lure,
and then get caught.

23:41.247 --> 23:43.456
BRITTANY: Our trip
has two points to it:

23:43.525 --> 23:46.010
one is hopefully
we bring some fish back

23:46.079 --> 23:47.978
for our freezer,

23:48.047 --> 23:50.256
but the biggest point is we
get to teach our kids about

23:50.325 --> 23:54.743
fishing and about getting
this sort of resource.

23:54.812 --> 23:58.747
KALEB: Fishing like this
is an exercise in patience,

23:58.816 --> 24:01.612
and if you're not patient,

24:01.681 --> 24:03.959
you're probably not
gonna have any luck.

24:04.028 --> 24:06.686
You don't always get what
you want when you want it.

24:09.758 --> 24:11.484
BRITTANY: We should.

24:11.553 --> 24:13.141
KALEB: Drill another hole?

24:13.210 --> 24:14.522
BRITTANY: Get another one going.

24:14.591 --> 24:15.868
That way you two
don't hook each other.

24:15.937 --> 24:16.938
KALEB: Yeah, let's do that.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.494
All right, it's time to
make some more holes, guys.

24:21.563 --> 24:24.428
We need to fish more area.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.032
BRITTANY: There goes
Daddy with the chainsaw.

24:42.101 --> 24:43.378
Who's gonna go
to the new hole?

24:43.447 --> 24:44.379
ELOVIE: Me!

24:44.448 --> 24:46.001
BRITTANY: Okay.

24:46.070 --> 24:48.245
GILBERT: I'm staying over here.
BRITTANY: Sounds like a plan.

24:54.078 --> 24:55.977
BRITTANY: Fishing is
kind of like hunting.

24:56.046 --> 24:58.842
You're not
guaranteed anything.

25:01.810 --> 25:03.881
That's super exciting,
but you have to have lots

25:03.950 --> 25:05.987
of patience until then.

25:12.165 --> 25:14.651
Ellie, you wanna go
see how Daddy's doing?

25:14.720 --> 25:15.893
ELOVIE: Yeah.

25:15.962 --> 25:18.206
BRITTANY: All right,
reel it in first.

25:18.275 --> 25:20.795
GILBERT: Oh, I just
saw a giant one!

25:20.864 --> 25:22.072
BRITTANY: You saw a giant one?

25:22.141 --> 25:25.662
GILBERT: Yeah.
I need to catch that one.

25:25.731 --> 25:26.732
Whoa.

25:30.770 --> 25:33.877
GILBERT: Whoa. What!

25:35.016 --> 25:35.948
BRITTANY: Kaleb!

25:36.017 --> 25:37.225
GILBERT: I actually got one!

25:37.294 --> 25:39.503
KALEB:
Wow, that one's nice sized!

25:39.572 --> 25:42.195
BRITTANY: Good job, Gilbert.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.718
KALEB: Wow, that's
a beautiful fish.

25:47.787 --> 25:49.340
This is a trout of some sort.

25:49.409 --> 25:50.652
BRITTANY: I think that's a,
yeah, I was going to say,

25:50.721 --> 25:51.895
it's a lake trout like
what I caught last time.

25:51.964 --> 25:53.241
KALEB: Yeah.

25:53.310 --> 25:55.795
BRITTANY: All right, Gilbert.
Go at it again.

25:55.864 --> 25:57.763
KALEB: Good job, Gilbert.
Proud of you, boy.

26:00.110 --> 26:01.732
You got another one!

26:01.801 --> 26:03.665
Yeah buddy!

26:03.734 --> 26:05.287
Fish number two!

26:06.426 --> 26:08.152
I'm gonna call you the slayer.

26:09.878 --> 26:11.431
You got it now, boy.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.089
GILBERT: Yup.

26:16.782 --> 26:18.438
KALEB: Man,
Gilbert's kicking our butts.

26:24.410 --> 26:25.791
Ha!

26:25.860 --> 26:27.965
BRITTANY: You got one?
KALEB: Yup.

26:28.034 --> 26:30.658
BRITTANY: Nice.

26:30.727 --> 26:32.867
I'm always excited
when the kids and I,

26:32.936 --> 26:35.697
and Kaleb get to do
something as a family that

26:35.766 --> 26:37.975
we don't always get to do.

26:39.045 --> 26:41.254
Yes! I got one!

26:41.323 --> 26:42.393
KALEB: Nice!

26:42.462 --> 26:44.154
ELOVIE: Aw, it's so cute.

26:47.467 --> 26:50.539
BRITTANY: We try to hunt
most of the meat that we eat.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.163
We don't often go fishing
so whenever we get the

26:53.232 --> 26:54.785
chance to do it.

26:54.854 --> 26:58.927
It's exciting because
that's changing up our diet.

26:58.996 --> 27:02.137
KALEB: Ha! I got one.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.795
ELOVIE:
Mom! Dad caught one!

27:07.764 --> 27:11.181
JOHNNY: To me,
the challenges are relative.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.321
Anywhere you live
you'll face challenges.

27:13.390 --> 27:16.531
It's how you adapt
to those challenges.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.327
I have to learn from nature
out here because there's no

27:19.396 --> 27:21.294
other source of information.

27:32.029 --> 27:35.239
JOHNNY: So, today's
the day to see if my little

27:35.308 --> 27:37.725
insulation plan worked.

27:37.794 --> 27:41.314
Which was spruce boughs
covered with snow.

27:41.383 --> 27:44.732
It's a little messier
than I hoped for.

27:44.801 --> 27:48.459
You can see the spruce boughs,
they crack, they break.

27:48.528 --> 27:50.669
Everything's so
brittle out here.

27:52.463 --> 27:57.468
And the hope was,
when the ice grows it'll
only grow a thinner layer,

27:57.537 --> 28:00.092
so I don't have
to chip down as far.

28:10.309 --> 28:11.482
That's water.

28:11.551 --> 28:14.796
I hit water. Awesome.

28:14.865 --> 28:16.625
I'm gonna fill the bucket
while I'm down here and I got

28:16.695 --> 28:19.318
the hole opened up.

28:19.387 --> 28:22.424
The spruce boughs
insulated it to a degree,

28:22.493 --> 28:24.633
there's no doubt about that.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.947
But it has quite a bit
of spruce chunks in here.

28:28.016 --> 28:32.331
They're super fragile
with these temperatures.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.713
So, if I remove these
every single day,

28:34.782 --> 28:38.578
it's just gonna be a
pile of, of broken twigs.

28:38.647 --> 28:40.684
I'm looking for
efficiency down here.

28:40.753 --> 28:44.308
So, I think I'm gonna try to
come up with another solution.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.487
You know the last time I was
walking around on the big lake

28:50.556 --> 28:54.042
I saw a lot of circles
where the caribou laid down.

28:54.111 --> 28:57.390
If a caribou hide keeps a
caribou warm laying on a lake,

28:57.459 --> 28:59.772
I think it would
insulate this.

28:59.841 --> 29:02.326
So I think that
option might work.

29:02.395 --> 29:03.811
Got the bucket full of water,

29:03.880 --> 29:05.502
I'm gonna take
it up to the cabin,

29:05.571 --> 29:07.504
and grab that caribou hide
and see if that'll work for

29:07.573 --> 29:11.646
insulating this water hole.

29:11.715 --> 29:13.959
I have to figure stuff
out on my own out here.

29:14.028 --> 29:15.236
I don't have the internet.

29:15.305 --> 29:19.067
I don't have something
I can just look up.

29:19.136 --> 29:21.000
So I'm gonna drape
this over the hole,

29:21.069 --> 29:22.968
and I'm gonna put a little
bit of snow on top 'cause I do

29:23.037 --> 29:25.418
know that snow
does help insulate.

29:26.903 --> 29:30.147
It's an interesting way of
life to just look at nature.

29:30.216 --> 29:33.150
What is nature doing?

29:33.219 --> 29:35.670
And I can apply these
principles of what nature's

29:35.739 --> 29:38.742
doing to my own life, and
that's how I survive out here.

29:44.472 --> 29:45.818
I think it's gonna work great.

29:45.887 --> 29:48.752
I'm excited to come back
tomorrow and check it out.

29:53.239 --> 29:55.034
CHRIS: It's almost like the
weather around here has like

29:55.103 --> 29:56.864
that attitude of its own.

29:56.933 --> 29:59.038
It'll go from 40 below to
ten above and drop right back

29:59.107 --> 30:00.902
down to 40 below.

30:00.971 --> 30:02.870
If you're not willing
to adapt and change
your ways of living,

30:02.939 --> 30:04.526
you won't survive.

30:10.567 --> 30:13.259
Awesome. It's looking good.

30:13.328 --> 30:14.951
It's starting to
warm up already,

30:15.020 --> 30:16.711
you can see it
steaming in there.

30:18.506 --> 30:21.233
JESSI: This tarp is
already too warm.

30:21.302 --> 30:22.890
You can feel how warm it is.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.063
CHRIS: That's fine.

30:24.132 --> 30:26.238
It's just a junk old tarp.

30:26.307 --> 30:27.756
JESSI: Yeah, I just don't
want it to be a junk old

30:27.826 --> 30:29.344
tarp on fire.

30:29.413 --> 30:30.725
CHRIS: Yeah, hopefully
everything goes and we don't

30:30.794 --> 30:32.485
light it on fire I guess.

30:32.554 --> 30:34.280
We've got five hours
of wait-time to see
how this thing works out.

30:34.349 --> 30:35.972
JESSI: Yeah.

30:36.041 --> 30:37.076
CHRIS: We'll come back in about
a half an hour and check on it.

30:37.145 --> 30:38.940
JESSI: Great.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.633
CHRIS: This isn't the first
time I've had to thaw a

30:42.702 --> 30:45.119
Snow-Go out, but this
is gonna be the first time

30:45.188 --> 30:47.569
that I sit inside and watch.

30:47.638 --> 30:48.881
In the past,

30:48.950 --> 30:50.538
I've tried to build
these shanty towns where

30:50.607 --> 30:52.091
you wrap a tarp around a
snow machine and you get

30:52.160 --> 30:54.853
a fire going, and I actually
lit the snow machine on fire,

30:56.613 --> 30:58.373
and so I've learned
from those lessons.

31:02.377 --> 31:05.139
This sure beats sitting out
on a cold stump watching it.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.623
JESSI: Yeah,
this is going great.

31:06.692 --> 31:09.212
Kind of, kind of surprising.

31:09.281 --> 31:10.420
CHRIS: As long as it
doesn't catch fire,

31:10.489 --> 31:12.353
I feel like I'm winning.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.358
JESSI: Okay, you see
what I'm looking at?

31:17.427 --> 31:18.877
Come here.

31:18.946 --> 31:21.017
You see where the stack is
and the smoke's coming out,

31:21.086 --> 31:22.190
but you see to
the right of that?

31:22.259 --> 31:24.054
CHRIS: I'm sure
it's just steam.

31:24.123 --> 31:25.469
That's a big puff of smoke.

31:25.538 --> 31:28.024
Go make sure it's not on fire.

31:33.995 --> 31:36.618
JESSI: Do you see that?
CHRIS: Oh, yeah.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.448
JESSI:
I just got worried, you know?

31:38.517 --> 31:40.105
CHRIS: Well, let
me check on it.

31:45.455 --> 31:47.698
It's pretty warm.

31:47.767 --> 31:50.770
Everything's dripping.

31:50.839 --> 31:53.601
This is looking good.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.465
Turns out the Snow-Go
is just melting and it's

31:55.534 --> 31:56.811
steam coming out.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.192
Uh, but it was close call.

31:58.261 --> 32:00.159
Had that been a fire,
we could have put it out.

32:02.851 --> 32:04.060
Wow.

32:04.129 --> 32:05.889
JESSI: That's good.
Really safe, you know?

32:05.958 --> 32:08.719
CHRIS: Close call.
JESSI: Better safe than sorry.

32:08.788 --> 32:11.860
Thaw baby, thaw.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.346
ALEX: Here in Alaska,
when the going gets rough,

32:14.415 --> 32:16.313
I just think
"Okay, just be scrappy."

32:16.382 --> 32:17.832
Anywhere you can
get a little advantage,

32:17.901 --> 32:19.213
just take it.

32:19.282 --> 32:21.146
Get your punches in
any way you can and,

32:21.215 --> 32:23.010
and just make it
to the next round.

32:25.564 --> 32:27.497
I finally got a really
good night's rest.

32:29.602 --> 32:31.535
I've been up since pretty
early this morning,

32:31.604 --> 32:33.365
been chopping a lot
more firewood.

32:33.434 --> 32:34.918
I'm just trying to get
myself set up for success

32:34.987 --> 32:36.885
for the future.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.405
And my quality of life
is majorly improved just by,

32:39.474 --> 32:41.442
you know, moving into
this tent and being able

32:41.511 --> 32:43.237
to put this stove to good use,

32:43.306 --> 32:46.723
but the idea that I had to put
the spruce branches underneath,

32:46.792 --> 32:49.898
it just wasn't a good one,
um, it's just not working.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.556
The floor is not
even close to level.

32:52.625 --> 32:55.145
But the, the real issue is
that it's kinda making this a

32:55.214 --> 32:59.701
fire hazard because the stove
was leaning on it too heavily,

32:59.770 --> 33:02.463
uh, it's, it's kinda
causing it to burn.

33:02.532 --> 33:05.259
It's melted onto the pipe
and it makes a bad smell.

33:05.328 --> 33:08.020
It's really just gonna
endanger the tent, uh,

33:08.089 --> 33:09.677
and not to mention
just make living here

33:09.746 --> 33:11.058
a lot more difficult.

33:14.854 --> 33:18.099
So, what I wanna do
is address this issue.

33:18.168 --> 33:21.033
I think the best thing to do
will be actually just to move

33:21.102 --> 33:22.966
where the tent is.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.899
Basically, we gotta kind
make a new footprint for it.

33:24.968 --> 33:26.694
Try to get it hard,
try to get it level.

33:26.763 --> 33:30.111
Dig down to the bare ground.

33:30.180 --> 33:32.907
So this is where I'm
gonna put the, the tent.

33:32.976 --> 33:34.667
I'll leave it up where
it is for now just in case

33:34.736 --> 33:37.049
this ends up taking
more time than I expect.

33:37.118 --> 33:38.913
I've still got a place
I can go back to.

33:38.982 --> 33:40.984
Kind of a create a new
footprint right here.

33:41.053 --> 33:43.124
Uh, it's gonna involve
a lot of shoveling.

33:43.193 --> 33:46.127
Uh, you know, it's always work.

33:51.339 --> 33:53.686
A few days ago,
doing this work,

33:53.755 --> 33:55.895
I would have been like
really kinda hyper aware of,

33:55.964 --> 33:57.345
"Okay, don't work too hard,

33:57.414 --> 33:59.451
don't get sweaty at all
'cause it's a real danger."

34:01.211 --> 34:04.042
Now, with my tent sitting there,

34:04.111 --> 34:06.009
and the stove, you know,
just trickling away,

34:06.078 --> 34:07.769
staying, you know,
nice and warm in there.

34:09.254 --> 34:11.532
Uh, I'm not worried
about it, you know.

34:16.261 --> 34:18.435
Uh, so this is good.

34:18.504 --> 34:20.644
Uh, I think I can just
start breaking my tent down.

34:20.713 --> 34:22.922
Moving it over here.

34:22.991 --> 34:24.545
Yeah, I think I've lived in
Alaska and lived off the bush

34:24.614 --> 34:27.375
long enough that it doesn't
upset me if my best laid plan

34:27.444 --> 34:29.584
totally gets destroyed.

34:29.653 --> 34:31.517
All right, back to square one.

34:32.967 --> 34:35.142
I just get scrappy
and keep going.

34:35.211 --> 34:37.489
And, and that's gonna
make me so much tougher,

34:37.558 --> 34:40.250
and when I take on the next
bigger challenge, you know,

34:40.319 --> 34:41.872
I'll be ready for it.

34:41.941 --> 34:44.151
Yeah, that looks good.

34:44.220 --> 34:46.601
Cool.

34:46.670 --> 34:49.846
I'm not out here doing this
because I'm afraid of failure.

34:49.915 --> 34:51.917
I'm doing it because
there's something worthwhile

34:51.986 --> 34:53.263
that I wanna gain.

34:56.956 --> 34:59.373
Yeah, so now that I've,
I've got my tent kind

34:59.442 --> 35:00.546
of rebuilt here.

35:00.615 --> 35:02.928
I do have a nice,
flat, even floor.

35:02.997 --> 35:05.517
So, I'm gonna get my sled
and start moving things in.

35:08.830 --> 35:11.592
KALEB: Bush education is
about more than just reading,

35:11.661 --> 35:13.352
writing, and arithmetic.

35:13.421 --> 35:16.804
It's about learning how
to catch fish, build a fire,

35:16.873 --> 35:17.977
shoot a moose.

35:18.046 --> 35:19.807
It's the school
of the wilderness.

35:25.399 --> 35:27.953
KALEB: So far this
has been a great day.

35:28.022 --> 35:31.163
We've been fishing here
for several hours now,

35:31.232 --> 35:35.098
between Gilbert and I we've
caught ten fish or so.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.617
BRITTANY: I've gotten one.

35:36.686 --> 35:38.964
KALEB: And Brittany's
gotten one.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.931
Ellie, she hasn't
caught anything.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.529
KALEB: I'm starting to think
we should shift our attention

35:52.598 --> 35:54.980
from fishing to building
a fire and roasting

35:55.049 --> 35:56.395
some of these fish.

35:56.464 --> 35:58.811
Maybe it's time to enjoy
the fruits of our labors.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.820
It's really easy to lose
track of time when you're

36:07.889 --> 36:11.548
having a blast, but it's
getting late in the day,

36:11.617 --> 36:14.793
it's gonna be dark soon and
I need to get a fire going.

36:14.862 --> 36:16.174
Cook some fish.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.766
Gilbert, I got some
little small pieces,

36:22.835 --> 36:24.147
do you wanna try and chop 'em?

36:24.216 --> 36:25.493
GILBERT: Yeah!

36:25.562 --> 36:27.495
KALEB: Whack this thing
down right like this.

36:27.564 --> 36:28.841
GILBERT: Okay.

36:28.910 --> 36:31.085
KALEB: Remember to keep
your legs spread wide.

36:31.154 --> 36:33.018
Then whack that sucker.

36:33.087 --> 36:36.401
GILBERT: Ready?
KALEB: Yup.

36:36.470 --> 36:37.678
All right, now what
we're gonna do,

36:37.747 --> 36:39.127
is we're gonna turn it over,

36:39.197 --> 36:41.371
and we're gonna whack
it hard on the ice, okay?

36:41.440 --> 36:43.442
Watch, like this.

36:43.511 --> 36:46.411
Good job you split one!

36:47.929 --> 36:51.174
Today has been a great
bush education for the kids.

36:51.243 --> 36:54.039
Their little brains are
soaking up so much knowledge.

36:54.108 --> 36:56.766
Learning about gathering
resource through the ice.

36:56.835 --> 36:58.319
They're getting to
learn a little bit

36:58.388 --> 37:01.011
about chopping firewood.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.462
BRITTANY: Yeah, buddy!
KALEB: Good pitch. Good job.

37:12.816 --> 37:14.715
KALEB: It's not important for
them to learn all the lessons

37:14.784 --> 37:17.165
right now, immediately.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.616
It's important to just
slowly learn them,

37:19.685 --> 37:22.412
time after time after time
as they grow up until in

37:22.481 --> 37:25.277
three or four years this
stuff's should be second nature.

37:27.037 --> 37:29.074
BRITTANY: Yeah!

37:30.420 --> 37:32.008
KALEB: They will
be very smart children when it

37:32.077 --> 37:35.977
comes to rural Alaskan living.

37:36.046 --> 37:39.395
The patience and
perseverance to stick it out.

37:39.464 --> 37:42.674
The payoff to a
lot of hard work.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.194
I think I was about your age
when I started splitting wood,

37:46.264 --> 37:47.403
you know that?

37:49.059 --> 37:50.647
Yeah!

37:50.716 --> 37:55.618
BRITTANY: Yeah!
KALEB: Nice job.
ELOVIE: Mom! I got one!

37:55.687 --> 37:59.794
BRITTANY: What? Look at that.
Get it out, get it out!

37:59.863 --> 38:01.934
Look at that, Ellie!
Oh no.

38:02.003 --> 38:03.729
ELOVIE: Oh no!

38:06.111 --> 38:07.940
BRITTANY: Look at that, Ellie!

38:08.009 --> 38:09.010
Oh no.

38:09.079 --> 38:10.184
ELOVIE: Oh no!

38:10.253 --> 38:13.532
BRITTANY:
Elovie what, pull it out.

38:13.601 --> 38:16.086
Elovie, who has not gotten
to get any fish yet,

38:16.155 --> 38:17.674
she pulls up a fish.

38:17.743 --> 38:19.607
You got a Dolly Varden!

38:19.676 --> 38:21.920
ELOVIE: Dolly Varden.

38:21.989 --> 38:23.991
BRITTANY: It was
amazing and so exciting for her,

38:24.060 --> 38:25.337
she was our little
cheerleader all day and

38:25.406 --> 38:28.306
finally she's
also seeing success.

38:28.375 --> 38:31.136
KALEB:
Good job, Ellie.
You caught one.

38:31.205 --> 38:33.241
Don't leave me hanging!

38:33.311 --> 38:34.829
Good job.

38:34.898 --> 38:37.073
ELOVIE: Yeah, baby.

38:37.142 --> 38:39.593
BRITTANY: Now we can walk
away and know that all four

38:39.662 --> 38:43.769
of us had such a huge part
in collecting these fish.

38:46.151 --> 38:48.118
KALEB: Let's
see if I can roast a fish.

38:52.709 --> 38:54.884
JOHNNY: Java.

38:54.953 --> 38:57.680
You wanna help me
dig this up? Huh?

38:57.749 --> 38:59.371
Get it!

39:02.098 --> 39:04.065
All right, get out of here.

39:08.691 --> 39:10.865
This is the coldest
it's been in a while.

39:10.934 --> 39:13.420
We're in a pretty
deep cold spell.

39:13.489 --> 39:16.354
With the windchill,
it's around negative 70.

39:16.423 --> 39:18.632
So if this caribou hide
works in these temperatures,

39:18.701 --> 39:20.461
it's definitely gonna work in,

39:20.530 --> 39:22.636
in any other
temperature I see out here.

39:25.673 --> 39:26.674
Cool.

39:26.743 --> 39:28.711
Just like that, there's water.

39:28.780 --> 39:29.884
It's clean.

39:29.953 --> 39:32.024
It didn't take long
to get through,

39:32.093 --> 39:34.613
so I would definitely
say this was a success.

39:34.682 --> 39:36.512
Every season has its
difficulties when it comes to

39:36.581 --> 39:39.584
getting water, whether it's
the middle of winter or the

39:39.653 --> 39:40.999
middle of summer.

39:41.068 --> 39:43.622
You just adapt
to those changes.

39:43.691 --> 39:46.798
Some for you Java.

39:46.867 --> 39:48.627
Some for me.

39:48.696 --> 39:50.146
You work with nature.

39:50.215 --> 39:52.493
You figure out how to do it,
and once you figure it out,

39:52.562 --> 39:55.116
you learn how to
be more efficient,

39:55.185 --> 39:56.946
and that's what
I'm doing here.

39:59.535 --> 40:01.951
That is a damn
good cup of coffee.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.022
Thanks nature.

40:08.889 --> 40:10.477
ALEX: Just getting the
last stuff from my, uh,

40:10.546 --> 40:12.686
from my old camp here.

40:12.755 --> 40:14.273
It was just a couple days
ago that I lived here,

40:14.342 --> 40:16.275
but it seems like ages ago.

40:16.344 --> 40:17.794
Every tool I brought
has its purpose so,

40:17.863 --> 40:19.555
and this one served
its, its purpose well.

40:19.624 --> 40:22.937
So, after several long
nights of negative 20 and

40:23.006 --> 40:25.595
negative 30-degree
weather in a backpacking tent,

40:25.664 --> 40:29.979
I'm kind of excited to
move into this new home.

40:30.048 --> 40:34.742
Although it's kinda
humbled by modern American
standards to live in a tent,

40:34.811 --> 40:36.675
for me it's gonna
be like moving into a

40:36.744 --> 40:39.195
five star hotel with
all the amenities.

40:39.264 --> 40:42.543
It's a warm place,
a place where I can cook.

40:42.612 --> 40:45.097
A place I can dry
off my wet clothes.

40:45.166 --> 40:47.099
A place I can
organize my gear.

40:48.066 --> 40:50.309
I'm set, you know?

40:52.933 --> 40:55.314
With just a few days of work,
and a little bit of grit,

40:55.383 --> 40:57.040
you know, the whole
world can change.

40:57.109 --> 40:59.733
That's what this lifestyle's
all about, it's, um,

40:59.802 --> 41:03.219
you come out here with nothing
and just do it all from scratch,

41:03.288 --> 41:06.671
kind of bring in the wonder
back in life, you know?

41:06.740 --> 41:09.536
This is the first step
on a really exciting,

41:09.605 --> 41:12.193
unpredictable
journey, you know?

41:16.819 --> 41:21.789
BRITTANY: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

41:21.858 --> 41:24.067
ELOVIE: 16!
BRITTANY: 16!

41:24.136 --> 41:27.001
We have 16 fish guys!

41:27.070 --> 41:31.385
KALEB: Oh, yeah.
We're getting some heat now.

41:31.454 --> 41:36.770
Just doing it hotdog style
with a stick and a fire.

41:36.839 --> 41:38.875
BRITTANY: Having an
activity with the family,

41:38.944 --> 41:43.362
where it's educational and
it's fun and it's entertaining,

41:43.431 --> 41:45.675
you can't really get
much better than that.

41:45.744 --> 41:48.713
It makes a really good life.

41:48.782 --> 41:51.025
Well kids, there's
this saying,

41:51.094 --> 41:53.407
"you can either
give a man a fish,

41:53.476 --> 41:55.236
and they will eat for a day,

41:55.305 --> 41:58.446
or you can
teach them how to fish,

41:58.516 --> 42:01.001
and they will eat
for a lifetime."

42:01.070 --> 42:03.210
And that's what
we're trying to teach you guys.

42:06.316 --> 42:08.698
KALEB: It's just incredible
seeing the transformation when

42:08.767 --> 42:13.531
you get kids out and teach
them these fundamentals of

42:13.600 --> 42:16.879
life in the woods.

42:16.948 --> 42:18.328
For me as a parent,

42:18.397 --> 42:20.883
it is so exciting seeing
this progression from just a

42:20.952 --> 42:26.198
bumbling kid to a capable,
young, adventure-minded person.

42:26.267 --> 42:28.097
BRITTANY: He doesn't
want to end this,

42:28.166 --> 42:29.236
and I think that's the best.

42:29.305 --> 42:31.134
And he caught another fish!

42:31.203 --> 42:33.102
KALEB: And he just,
last second, twelfth hour,

42:33.171 --> 42:34.379
caught another fish.

42:34.448 --> 42:35.414
Nice job, Gilbert.

42:35.483 --> 42:37.106
BRITTANY:
Good job, Gil.

42:40.454 --> 42:42.318
CHRIS: I think it's time to
get this thing outta here.

42:42.387 --> 42:44.251
JESSI: Sure, let's check it out.

42:49.981 --> 42:52.604
CHRIS: Oh, no ice
at all actually.

42:52.673 --> 42:54.088
JESSI: There's not
any, like, water.

42:54.157 --> 42:56.297
There's no ice.
There's no snow.

42:56.366 --> 42:58.334
CHRIS: Worked like a charm.

42:58.403 --> 43:00.992
Let's drop this thing down
to the ground and try it out.

43:01.061 --> 43:03.201
See if it'll start right up.

43:03.270 --> 43:06.100
This little shanty town of
a shed worked pretty well.

43:06.169 --> 43:07.895
I mean it might have looked
kinda janky hanging in the

43:07.964 --> 43:10.277
tree with the tarp over it,
but this snow machine's

43:10.346 --> 43:12.969
completely thawed out,
now it's gonna be the, uh,

43:13.038 --> 43:15.247
the real test though.

43:15.316 --> 43:16.801
Let's see if she starts.

43:18.250 --> 43:22.461
[engine starts]

43:22.530 --> 43:24.705
Awesome.

43:24.774 --> 43:26.327
JESSI: The Snow-Go works.

43:26.396 --> 43:27.708
We're now in the clear.

43:27.777 --> 43:31.125
I can exhale that breath
that I've been holding.

43:34.094 --> 43:35.992
CHRIS: Climbing a mountain is
only fun because of the hard

43:36.061 --> 43:37.718
work you have to put in,

43:37.787 --> 43:40.100
and if it was just easy
every day out here,

43:40.169 --> 43:41.964
I don't think we
would enjoy it as much,

43:42.033 --> 43:44.242
but the fact that there's
a challenge at every corner,

43:44.311 --> 43:45.899
it's always a surprise
and it's always an

43:45.968 --> 43:47.348
adventure out here.

43:47.417 --> 43:51.559
Alaska is the ultimate like
no other place on Earth.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.976
JESSI: Great.

43:54.045 --> 43:55.494
CHRIS: Awesome,
it works great.

43:55.563 --> 43:57.186
The steering is so
easy to turn, man.

43:57.255 --> 43:58.428
JESSI: Awesome.

43:58.497 --> 44:00.361
CHRIS: Go get some
chores done with it?

44:00.430 --> 44:03.157
JESSI: We'll, uh,
plant some snares.

44:03.226 --> 44:04.987
Check the trapline.

44:05.056 --> 44:07.196
Start doing stuff with
the Snow-Go since we
haven't had it.
