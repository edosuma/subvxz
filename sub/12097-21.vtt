No, I threw up
in the men's room.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.186
Are you ready to order?

10:21.187 --> 10:23.688
I think so.
Jessica?

10:23.689 --> 10:25.690
Yes, I think
that I will have the...

10:25.691 --> 10:26.691
Sole Veronique, please.

10:26.692 --> 10:30.695
Ah, Sole Veronique.
Very nice. Very nice.

10:30.696 --> 10:33.198
And I'll have the fresh mussels.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.699
Mussels?

10:34.700 --> 10:36.201
Right.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.203
Do you want mussels?

10:38.204 --> 10:39.704
There aren't any mussels?

10:39.705 --> 10:43.208
Oh, for the seagulls, maybe.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.710
This is the wrong season
for mussels.

10:45.711 --> 10:48.213
Mussels. Did I say
mussels?

10:48.214 --> 10:50.715
How dumb. What
was I thinking?

10:50.716 --> 10:52.717
We're not even close
to the mussel season.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.220
I know, mussels now?
What a laugh.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.221
I didn't mean to say mussels.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.723
I meant to say Brussels.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.225
Brussels sprouts.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.227
Do you want...

11:02.228 --> 11:05.231
You want Brussels sprouts
as a main course?

11:08.234 --> 11:10.735
Of course not.
For the main course,

11:10.736 --> 11:12.737
I'd like to have
the Duck L'Orange.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.740
And could I please have peaches
instead of oranges?

11:15.741 --> 11:17.743
No.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.245
Just testing.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.247
I'll have the oranges,

11:22.248 --> 11:25.251
and bring us a bottle
of your '56 Montrechet.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.254
[SIGH]

11:30.256 --> 11:31.256
Same as the mussels?

11:31.257 --> 11:32.757
Fifty-six?

11:32.758 --> 11:34.259
No?

11:34.260 --> 11:36.261
Think.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.764
Frost in '56.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.768
The big frost?

11:44.770 --> 11:47.272
Oh, the big frost!

11:47.273 --> 11:48.773
I forgot all about it.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.777
The wine was terrible that year.
Fudgsicles were good.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.779
Completely forget
about the wine.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.281
Just bring us a bottle
of your best.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.285
Perhaps you'd like that to go.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.789
It's not over between us?

12:04.790 --> 12:06.291
No.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.792
I came here, really,
to apologize

12:07.793 --> 12:10.795
for taking so long
to make a decision.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.297
Oh, that's okay. I understand.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.299
I just can't decide.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.300
Well, its not like

12:15.301 --> 12:16.801
you're picking a wallpaper,
you know.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.303
I know.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.306
Well, if it were medieval times,
it would be so much easier.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.807
I mean, then,

12:22.808 --> 12:24.809
if a lady couldn't decide
between two suitors,

12:24.810 --> 12:27.312
she'd give them a kind of a test
like, uh, you know,

12:27.313 --> 12:28.313
who could slay a dragon

12:28.314 --> 12:29.814
and that one
would be the winner.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.817
Gee, if I only knew
where there was a dragon.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.320
What if I slay Chester?

12:37.823 --> 12:40.325
I promise you
I'll make a decision soon.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.327
It's not easy, you know.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.328
Especially the nights.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.829
Lying alone there,

12:44.830 --> 12:46.831
wondering what you and Chester
are doing in bed.

12:46.832 --> 12:47.833
Nothing.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.835
We sleep.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.837
Oh, come on, Jessica.

12:52.838 --> 12:56.341
No, I mean, really,
we're not having any sex.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.904
[LOUDLY]
You're not having sex with him?

13:00.846 --> 13:02.347
Great. Want to have sex with me?

13:05.351 --> 13:07.852
I just wanted to ask you,

13:07.853 --> 13:10.855
please, to be patient with me
a little while longer.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.857
I'll be patient with you
for the rest of my life.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.360
Golly, it would be
so much easier

13:15.361 --> 13:17.362
if you weren't so perfect.

13:17.363 --> 13:18.863
Oh...

13:18.864 --> 13:20.865
[THUMP]

13:20.866 --> 13:24.369
Your wine, monsieur.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.384
Oh, Benson,

13:39.385 --> 13:41.386
Corinne and Tim
will be here soon.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.889
I think you should go upstairs
and make up their room.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.891
You do, do you?

13:46.892 --> 13:48.393
Yes, Benson,

13:48.394 --> 13:49.394
while you're at it,

13:49.395 --> 13:50.895
you can make up our room too,

13:50.896 --> 13:52.897
The sheets haven't
been changed in days.

13:52.898 --> 13:53.898
That's because

13:53.899 --> 13:55.400
I haven't changed them in days.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.402
I'm aware of that.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.904
And unless that devil upstairs
makes other living arrangements,

13:59.905 --> 14:01.907
I'm never going up there again.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.910
What about our bed?

14:05.911 --> 14:07.712
Bring it down here.
I'll be glad to change it.

14:08.914 --> 14:12.917
Benson...
there is no devil upstairs.

14:12.918 --> 14:13.918
Fine.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.920
You go change the baby.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.423
Benson, what are you afraid of?

14:18.424 --> 14:20.925
Death...
pain and death.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.927
How about unemployment?

14:22.928 --> 14:25.430
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.432
Oh, Corinne,

14:27.433 --> 14:28.433
how are you, darling?

14:28.434 --> 14:30.435
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

14:30.436 --> 14:34.939
Well, hey... s... son.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
So how's the baby?

14:36.942 --> 14:38.943
Fine. Just fine.

14:38.944 --> 14:39.944
Corinne and Benson

14:39.945 --> 14:41.946
seem to think we have a problem.

14:41.947 --> 14:42.947
Frankly, I haven't noticed

14:42.948 --> 14:44.449
anything out of the ordinary

14:44.450 --> 14:45.950
a little house shaking,

14:45.951 --> 14:47.452
a little light blinking

14:47.453 --> 14:48.953
a little furniture flying...

14:48.954 --> 14:51.456
a little maniacal laughter.

14:51.457 --> 14:54.459
But I'm sure he finds it
all very amusing.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.461
Personally, I don't think
he's possessed.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.464
I think he's a little hyper.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.971
Of course, everyone's entitled
to their own opinion.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.983
Don't get me wrong.

15:18.984 --> 15:19.984
I enjoy <i>Superman,</i>

15:19.985 --> 15:21.486
but for $42 million dollars,

15:21.487 --> 15:23.127
he should've been
flying around the lobby.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.992
Oh, Jodie!

15:27.993 --> 15:29.494
Hi.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.995
Hi.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.498
Sorry, I didn't know
you were home.

15:33.499 --> 15:34.999
I am.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.001
Maxine, this is Jodie.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.002
Hi.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.505
Larry.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.506
Hi.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.007
Hi.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.510
That's Alice and Maxine.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.011
Hi.
Hi.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.014
Hi.
Hi.

15:50.015 --> 15:51.015
We'll go.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.517
You don't have to go.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.018
Don't be silly.
Come on, we'll go.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.520
No, no, no, don't be silly.

15:55.521 --> 15:56.521
This is your apartment.

15:56.522 --> 15:57.522
Alice, you live in it too.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.523
Don't be silly.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.024
Alice, don't tell me,
"Don't be silly."

16:00.025 --> 16:02.026
I can leave if I want to.
I live here.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.529
Alice, it's okay.
I better go anyway.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.030
Don't be silly.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.534
No, really, I've got to catch
a subway all the way downtown,

16:09.535 --> 16:11.536
and when it gets late,
I get afraid,

16:11.537 --> 16:14.038
so I think it's best I go now.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.039
Actually, I'm on my way
downtown myself.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.541
I'll go with you.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.042
Oh, terrific.

16:18.043 --> 16:21.546
Well, don't do anything
we wouldn't do.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.551
How could we?

16:26.552 --> 16:28.053
Maxine, I'll call you.

16:33.559 --> 16:36.060
So was that your type?

16:36.061 --> 16:38.563
What do you mean, "type"?

16:38.564 --> 16:41.566
Type. Type...
is that what you like?

16:41.567 --> 16:44.569
That happens to be a person,
a very nice person.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.071
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

16:47.072 --> 16:50.074
It's just that she looks like
Karl Malden.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.076
Please, don't start.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.079
Your friend wears more jewelry
than I do.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.081
What are you talking about?

16:57.082 --> 16:59.083
Did you see what he was wearing
around his neck?

16:59.084 --> 17:01.586
If he threw it
over the side of a ship,

17:01.587 --> 17:02.587
it'd be an anchor.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.089
Alice, I wouldn't
talk about taste if I were you.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.592
I mean, that girl...
and I use the term loosely...

17:07.593 --> 17:11.095
gives new meaning to the word
"tacky."

17:11.096 --> 17:13.097
Well, at least
I'm with a human being,

17:13.098 --> 17:15.599
not with an 8x10 glossy.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.608
What, are you jealous?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.611
Are you crazy?

17:26.612 --> 17:28.112
I think you're jealous.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.113
How could I be jealous?

17:29.114 --> 17:30.615
I'm gay.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.618
Besides which, if anyone
sounds jealous, it's you.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.120
What what makes you think
I'm jealous?

17:36.121 --> 17:37.121
Because you're acting jealous.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.123
Well, I am not jealous.
I couldn't possibly be.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.625
That's the most stupid thing
in the world.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.126
Well, God knows I'm not jealous.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.128
Then what are we talking
about, jealous?

17:44.129 --> 17:46.631
Neither one of us are jealous.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.132
How could we possibly
be jealous?

17:48.133 --> 17:49.634
We're gay.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.636
We're not jealous.
We're aggravated.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.137
Why are we aggravated?

17:53.138 --> 17:56.140
Probably because
we're a little jealous.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.643
You are jealous.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.645
Stop gloating, Alice.

18:00.646 --> 18:01.646
So are you.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.648
Well, why are we jealous?

18:03.649 --> 18:05.149
You're asking me?

18:05.150 --> 18:06.651
I mean, that's the
most craziest thing

18:06.652 --> 18:07.652
in the world.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.653
It's completely insane.

18:08.654 --> 18:09.654
I mean, you get jealous

18:09.655 --> 18:10.655
when you care about someone.

18:10.656 --> 18:11.656
I know that.

18:11.657 --> 18:12.657
Well, what's gonna happen?

18:12.658 --> 18:14.158
I don't know that.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.660
Well, it's probably gonna
make dating very tough.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.161
Not necessarily.
Do you wanna go out?

18:17.162 --> 18:18.162
When?
Now.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.163
Sure.
Is this a date?

18:19.164 --> 18:20.165
Don't push it.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.679
Tim's been up there for hours.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.681
What's he doing up there?

18:36.682 --> 18:39.684
Well, Corinne, you can't
beat the devil in a day.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.686
These things take time.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.188
It's just not fair, Ma.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.190
He's just a little baby.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.192
He doesn't understand
any of this.

18:48.193 --> 18:51.195
There's nothing in his life
that he can remember yet,

18:51.196 --> 18:52.697
much less understand.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.700
He's such a tiny little thing.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.702
He doesn't deserve this.

18:57.703 --> 19:00.204
Corinne...

19:00.205 --> 19:02.707
Begging the Colonel's pardon.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.711
Yes, Major, what is it?

19:06.712 --> 19:08.713
I don't want to upset the women,

19:08.714 --> 19:11.716
but we're doomed!

19:11.717 --> 19:13.217
Major.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.719
One more attack
like the last one,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.721
and this old troop ship

19:16.722 --> 19:21.225
will come apart
like tissue paper.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.728
Major, we're not on a ship.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.231
You mean we've landed?

19:31.236 --> 19:33.238
Hit the beach!

19:37.242 --> 19:38.242
[GASPS]

19:38.243 --> 19:39.744
Well?

19:39.745 --> 19:40.745
He's possessed, all right.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.246
Are you sure?

19:42.247 --> 19:44.248
All the signs are there.
He speaks in tongues.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.751
Tongues is usually
the dead give-away.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.753
Unless
he's fluent in Latin and Greek,

19:48.754 --> 19:51.756
you gotta go with possessed.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.758
That's how
you were able to tell.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.760
That and the fact
that he threw me

19:55.761 --> 19:57.762
across the room several times.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.263
What do we do now?

19:59.264 --> 20:01.766
It's not what we do now.
It's what I'm gonna do now.

20:01.767 --> 20:02.767
He's been waiting for me.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.769
He thinks my faith
has been weakened

20:04.770 --> 20:06.270
ever since
I left the priesthood.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.772
It's between me
and the Prince of Darkness.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.273
But I'll need your help.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.275
Well, I'm sure we'll all be glad

20:11.276 --> 20:12.777
to do anything we can to help,

20:12.778 --> 20:15.280
won't we, everybody?

20:19.284 --> 20:21.285
Oh, now see here,

20:21.286 --> 20:23.287
I've had about enough of that!

20:23.288 --> 20:25.290
[THUMPING ON RAILING]

20:28.293 --> 20:32.296
We are dealing
with a Prince of Darkness.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.798
Prince of Darkness...

20:33.799 --> 20:37.301
Prince of Rudeness
is more like it!

20:37.302 --> 20:38.803
Don't start with him, dear.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.304
I want you to know

20:40.305 --> 20:42.306
I'm holding you
personally responsible

20:42.307 --> 20:45.309
for any and all damages
done to these premises,

20:45.310 --> 20:46.811
except, of course, for the spoon

20:46.812 --> 20:49.313
that got caught
in the garbage disposal.

20:49.314 --> 20:51.816
I don't think I can blame him
for that.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.823
You have done it now!

20:59.324 --> 21:00.825
This is nothing.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.326
By the time he gets through,

21:02.327 --> 21:03.327
this house may not be
standing around.

21:03.328 --> 21:04.829
He'll turn us
against each other,

21:04.830 --> 21:06.831
throw us all over the room,
knock things over,

21:06.832 --> 21:07.832
tear fixtures out of the walls...

21:07.833 --> 21:08.833
Would you ask the devil

21:08.834 --> 21:10.835
not to fool around
with the phone?

21:10.836 --> 21:11.836
I am expecting an important call

21:11.837 --> 21:13.838
from Dutch's lawyer.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.339
Eunice!

21:15.340 --> 21:17.341
Well, Corinne, life goes on.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.844
[MENACING VOICE]
<i>Flotsky, get up here!</i>

21:21.847 --> 21:23.347
<i>Flotsky!</i>

21:23.348 --> 21:25.850
Answer him, for God's sake!

21:25.851 --> 21:28.853
<i>Shut up, you whimpering fool!</i>

21:28.854 --> 21:32.356
Right. Absolutely right.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.859
Yes, I whimper,
I have a tendency to whimper.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.361
<i>Shut up!</i>

21:42.367 --> 21:43.868
Corinne, I better go prepare.

21:43.869 --> 21:44.869
If anything happens to me,

21:44.870 --> 21:46.370
if the devil wins and I die,

21:46.371 --> 21:47.872
I want you to get in touch

21:47.873 --> 21:48.873
with this man.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.374
Father Carvellis?

21:50.375 --> 21:51.876
Yeah, I'm sure

21:51.877 --> 21:52.877
when Father Carvellis hears
how you died,

21:52.878 --> 21:55.380
he'll run right over.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.382
I said a prayer.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.884
I prayed for guidance
and strength,

21:59.885 --> 22:01.385
and I prayed
that you'd forgive me

22:01.386 --> 22:02.386
for ever having doubted you.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.387
I hope you can.

22:03.388 --> 22:04.889
<i>Flotsky!</i>

22:04.890 --> 22:07.892
Oh, my God!

22:07.893 --> 22:08.893
I better get up there.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.395
But I'll need someone
to help me.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.399
I'll go.
No, Corinne.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
Tim, I'm his mother.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.401
I should be up there.

22:17.402 --> 22:19.403
It's not your baby up there now,
Corinne.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.405
This is something
totally out of your control.

22:21.406 --> 22:22.907
Later, when he needs his mother,

22:22.908 --> 22:25.409
I'll let you come up,
but not now.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.410
I'll go.

22:26.411 --> 22:28.913
Benson...

22:28.914 --> 22:30.915
My mother always said to me,
she said,

22:30.916 --> 22:34.418
"Son, look the devil in the eye
and meet him straight on.

22:34.419 --> 22:35.920
"You can't wrestle him
to the ground

22:35.921 --> 22:37.923
unless you got ahold of him
first."

22:45.430 --> 22:50.434
My mother was a babbling fool,
is what she was.

22:50.435 --> 22:51.435
A major crackpot.

22:51.436 --> 22:54.439
Everybody knew it.
She was nuts!

<i>Are Alice and Jodie</i>
