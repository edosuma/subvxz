WEBVTT

02:23.625 --> 02:25.250
-I can help you.
-It's all right.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.166
I've got this. I'm good.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.458
Please come in.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.458
Here.

02:46.583 --> 02:50.708
Well, I've had them set you up out here
so you wouldn't feel quite so confined.

02:50.791 --> 02:53.166
The ladies will scandalize
the neighborhood

02:53.250 --> 02:55.375
by occupying both bedrooms.

02:55.458 --> 02:58.625
I will be staying in town
at a bucolic spa called,

02:58.708 --> 03:01.166
if you can believe it, The Shoulder Arms.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.875
I will do my editing there.
Now, as you know,

03:03.958 --> 03:06.625
Fraulein Freda is not only
a nurse and physical therapist,

03:06.708 --> 03:09.166
she studied nutrition
back in the old country.

03:09.250 --> 03:12.166
-Ja, liebes Fräulein?
-Jawohl, Herr Houseman.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.083
It's a dry house.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.875
The owner of the ranch
doesn't permit alcohol.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.833
But you're from Pennsylvania.
You're no doubt used to it.

03:21.916 --> 03:24.125
Saved by the proverbial bell.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.000
Set it here, please.

03:27.125 --> 03:30.500
And careful. Thank you.

03:35.875 --> 03:36.791
Observe.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.583
Naturally,
you'll do your damnedest to get at it.

03:41.666 --> 03:44.958
By the time you finish the first draft,
which is to say, in 90 days,

03:45.041 --> 03:47.625
you should be a world-class sprinter.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.000
Rita, come in here, will you?

03:51.833 --> 03:53.791
This is Mrs. Alexander.

03:53.875 --> 03:57.416
She types 100 perfect words a minute
and takes dictation like a clairvoyant.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.666
Rita Alexander, Herman Mankiewicz.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.333
How do you do, Mr. Mankiewicz?

04:01.416 --> 04:03.625
That's a big question.

04:04.458 --> 04:07.958
Well, since you like working nights,
Rita here runs on London time.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.791
Her husband
is one of our bold lads in the RAF.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.875
-Flies… What is it, Rita? Spitfires?
-Hurricanes.

04:13.958 --> 04:16.625
-My sympathy and prayers.
-I beg your pardon?

04:16.708 --> 04:21.500
Given the speed, climb, and turning radius
of the Messerschmitt Bf 109--

04:21.583 --> 04:24.250
I hope we won't need your sympathy,
Mr. Mankiewicz.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.791
We'll do the praying and the fighting.

04:26.875 --> 04:30.625
I will meet with Orson weekly.
Keep him to date on our progress.

04:30.708 --> 04:32.708
We're expecting great things.

04:32.791 --> 04:36.750
What is it the writer says?
"Tell the story you know."

04:39.250 --> 04:41.500
I don't know that writer.

04:44.833 --> 04:45.666
Hello.

04:46.375 --> 04:48.208
Yes. Yes, he's right here.

04:48.708 --> 04:52.125
Well, you should have everything.
If I've forgotten, there's a clipboard.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.416
-Yes? Hello?
-They're getting him.

04:58.125 --> 05:01.625
Our wunderkind
does have the gift of theatrical timing.

05:02.875 --> 05:04.750
Orson, hello. We just got in.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.416
-Hello.
-Mank.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.166
Houseman tells me
we have you just where we want you.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.625
Lucky me.

05:21.708 --> 05:24.750
-How's the leg?
-"Thigh bone's connected to the hip bone."

05:24.833 --> 05:27.833
Excellent. Ready and willing
to hunt the great white whale?

05:27.916 --> 05:32.708
Just call me Ahab.
I understand we've 90 days.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.166
Let's aim for 60.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.833
He's just cut a month.

05:36.916 --> 05:40.791
I used to do it in five for you
at the Mercury. This is leisurely.

05:40.875 --> 05:44.666
-Sixty days, and then we can noodle.
-Nothing like a good noodle.

05:44.750 --> 05:49.291
Is the reason you lopped 30 days
to run it past the RKO legal?

05:49.375 --> 05:52.875
I thought I told you, Mank.
I have final cut, final everything.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.458
There are no studio notes.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.750
We'll have no one but ourselves to blame.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.416
-Sixty days and a noodle.
-Mr. Welles, we're ready.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.833
Gotta run.
I'm doing tests for Heart of Darkness.

06:01.916 --> 06:04.166
Little that, lesser Joe Conrad.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.583
If anyone should ask,
tell 'em you're adapting.

06:06.666 --> 06:09.458
You don't know
this sun-bleached sewer here, my friend.

06:09.541 --> 06:11.333
Break wind at Hollywood and Vine,

06:11.416 --> 06:14.333
and a producer in Santa Monica
reports a ruptured main.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.250
No, I don't know this burg, not yet.

06:17.333 --> 06:21.000
I'm toiling with you in spirit, Mank.
And I don't hear any typing.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.125
No notes.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.583
And then he turns 24.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.875
Trapped.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.666
Let me take off these clothes.

06:49.250 --> 06:53.291
They let me go
just as I achieved perfect equilibrium.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.041
I won't work
with half the producers on the lot,

06:57.125 --> 06:59.916
and the other half won't work with me.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.666
-What's this, a racing form?
-You stop reading, you stop learning.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.875
Hold still.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.458
Lay back.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.708
Cigarette, please.

07:13.791 --> 07:16.833
Hermie, if a match gets near your breath,
you'll burst into flames.

07:16.916 --> 07:19.666
Even the dog's name is awful.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.250
Sounds like a Japanese houseboy.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.333
You mark my words, Sara.

07:24.833 --> 07:28.708
The Wizard of Oz
is gonna sink that studio.

07:28.791 --> 07:31.458
Sleep. You're driving
to New York tomorrow.

07:32.458 --> 07:36.500
Remember when you used to take the train
from back East?

07:36.583 --> 07:40.791
I'd sneak aboard in Albuquerque
and climb into your compartment naked.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.875
I also remember
how I spent my honeymoon in Berlin,

07:43.958 --> 07:46.083
with hookers running
up and down the stairs all night

07:46.166 --> 07:49.125
because my dashing correspondent
couldn't afford a nice hotel.

07:49.208 --> 07:52.791
-Weren't those the days?
-Yeah, and the nights weren't bad either.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.041
-Schnutz?
-For the last time, what?

07:56.125 --> 07:58.625
-What year is it?
-Herman…

07:59.125 --> 08:02.708
-I should have done something by now.
-Hermie…

08:02.791 --> 08:04.833
Give me a sign, oh, Lord.

08:04.916 --> 08:09.875
I am as your servant Moses,
though I won't work half as cheap.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.666
Go to sleep, meshuggener.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.125
-Schnutz?
-What?

08:16.208 --> 08:18.041
Why do you put up with me?

08:20.666 --> 08:21.666
I don't know.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.125
That bush in the front yard,

08:24.208 --> 08:28.458
if it catches fire tonight,
you will let me know?

08:31.541 --> 08:33.458
I mean, you know all kinds of things.

08:33.541 --> 08:36.750
Iambic pentameter,
the words of the great poets.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.291
What about the way she signed it?
"Always, Ethel."

08:40.083 --> 08:43.875
Can you beat that?
Not just "Ethel," "Always, Ethel."

08:43.958 --> 08:46.583
Tommy, if we can find civilization
by sundown,

08:46.666 --> 08:49.791
I hope to climb out of this crate
and into a cold martini.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.500
She's not the kind to use "always"
if she didn't mean it.

08:52.583 --> 08:55.250
If she meant just "Ethel,"
she'd write just "Ethel," not "always."

08:55.333 --> 08:57.291
-Wouldn't you think?
-The road, Tommy.

08:57.375 --> 09:01.416
I know. You read it. See what I mean.

09:12.041 --> 09:14.333
She loves me, don't you think?

09:33.708 --> 09:37.375
Mank? It's Orson Welles.

09:38.666 --> 09:42.875
-Of course it is.
-I think it's time we talked.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.750
I'm all ears.

09:52.541 --> 09:55.250
Once a castle on a hill,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.833
now a memory of what once was.

09:59.791 --> 10:05.250
Alone in his unfinished,
already decaying pleasure palace,

10:05.333 --> 10:09.250
aloof, seldom visited, never photographed,

10:10.125 --> 10:15.416
we see an old man in a robe,
smoking a pipe,

10:15.500 --> 10:18.291
sitting alone by his pool…

10:20.500 --> 10:24.291
discarded pages scattered at his feet.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.208
Narrator,

10:27.000 --> 10:33.708
"An emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire,

10:33.791 --> 10:36.583
vainly attempting to sway, as he once did,

10:36.666 --> 10:38.125
the destinies of a nation

10:38.208 --> 10:40.583
which had long since ceased to listen
to him…"

10:41.083 --> 10:43.625
No. "Had ceased to trust him."

10:44.125 --> 10:49.083
We see through trees as an aide
pushes this old man in a wheelchair

10:49.166 --> 10:51.958
across neatly groomed lawns.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.791
Narrator, "There, last month,

10:55.541 --> 10:59.375
as it must to all men, death came to--"

11:01.958 --> 11:03.708
Let's have that cuppa, Mrs. A.

11:12.083 --> 11:13.541
I know who it is.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.875
Or… who it's meant to be.

11:22.708 --> 11:25.250
What makes you think
it's meant to be anybody?

11:25.333 --> 11:26.166
Come now.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.166
Everyone in the English-speaking world
will recognize him instantly.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.500
Exactly what he would say.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.375
-Did you know the man?
-Maybe.

11:37.208 --> 11:38.083
I used to.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.875
-You wrote for one of his papers?
-No, praise God.

11:41.958 --> 11:45.666
I met him after he started bankrolling
his girlfriend's pictures.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.875
You knew Marion Davies?

11:49.666 --> 11:51.750
-If anyone did.
-Really?

11:52.791 --> 11:54.000
What's she like?

11:54.083 --> 11:58.208
Why is it when you scratch
a prim, starchy English schoolgirl,

11:58.291 --> 12:00.791
you get a swooning moving-picture fan

12:00.875 --> 12:03.833
who's forgotten all she learned
about the Battle of Hastings?

12:03.916 --> 12:07.250
Hastings. Fourteen October 1066,

12:07.333 --> 12:08.958
ten centigrade.

12:43.958 --> 12:44.958
Mank?

12:51.083 --> 12:53.041
Sorry. Somebody told me
Mankiewicz was in here.

12:53.125 --> 12:56.125
He is. I'm the promising brother, Joe.

12:56.958 --> 13:00.541
-I didn't know Herman had a brother.
-Neither does anyone else.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.833
Let me guess.
"There are millions to be made,

13:03.916 --> 13:06.625
and your only competition
is idiots," stop.

13:07.375 --> 13:08.291
How did you know?

13:08.375 --> 13:11.125
I hate to tell you,
anyone who can rub three words together

13:11.208 --> 13:13.000
and make a sentence gets one.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.125
Come on.

13:25.083 --> 13:28.625
It's after lunch, and we're on a deadline.
He may be busy.

13:29.416 --> 13:32.750
-I promise I won't be a bother.
-Not exactly what I meant.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.833
Come on!

13:39.916 --> 13:42.083
-Hey, you know I'm good for it.
-Fellas.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.291
These are high stakes.

13:48.375 --> 13:51.208
-Tails! That's it!
-God damn it!

13:51.291 --> 13:53.833
-Mank!
-All right. Double or nothing.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.291
This time, banjo-eyed son of a bitch,
let it hit the floor.

13:56.375 --> 13:57.833
-Banjo eyes.
-Son of a bitch…

13:57.916 --> 13:59.416
Mank once bet me a five-spot

13:59.500 --> 14:02.625
to see how long it would take
a falling leaf to hit the ground.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.875
-Had to go to management to cover it.
-For five bucks?

14:05.958 --> 14:07.500
Five thousand.

14:07.583 --> 14:08.791
Come on.

14:09.458 --> 14:12.750
Heads, you bastard!

14:15.291 --> 14:16.208
Mank!

14:18.166 --> 14:20.125
Pleasure doing business
with you, gentlemen.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.125
Hey, Charlie.

14:22.208 --> 14:26.708
Yeah. You all remember
the Algonquin cabin boy, Charlie Lederer,

14:26.791 --> 14:29.250
a poor but somewhat talented
magazine writer,

14:29.333 --> 14:31.291
come West to join our merry band?

14:31.375 --> 14:33.583
-Well, you know most everyone.
-Mr. Kaufman.

14:33.666 --> 14:34.833
George is fine, kid.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.500
-Mr. Perelman.
-Nice to meet you.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.250
Do you prefer Sidney or S.J.?

14:38.333 --> 14:41.125
He takes what he gets.
The great Charles MacArthur.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.750
Good to see you again.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.250
My resident jack-of-all-trades,
Shelly Metcalf.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.625
-Hey, kid.
-Mr. Metcalf.

14:46.708 --> 14:48.625
Save the "mister" for the anointed.

14:48.708 --> 14:50.791
And last, not yet among them,
my brother Joe.

14:50.875 --> 14:54.791
Have Cyclone say, "I don't mind the heat
as much as I do the humanity."

14:54.875 --> 14:58.541
And the one and only Ben Hecht.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.041
Have you been laid yet?

15:01.208 --> 15:03.083
Do you have to think about that?

15:06.333 --> 15:07.208
Hello.

15:07.916 --> 15:09.958
Yeah. Right away.

15:10.666 --> 15:13.250
Selznick, everyone. Five minutes.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.208
You've arrived in the well-known nick.

15:15.291 --> 15:18.708
Just in time for a story conference
with the great David O.

15:18.791 --> 15:20.208
Once more unto the breach…

15:20.708 --> 15:22.333
Breach? Hell, unto the wire…

15:22.416 --> 15:23.541
Without a net.

15:23.625 --> 15:26.250
Keep your mouth shut
and watch us for your cue, okay?

15:26.333 --> 15:27.166
Cue?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.833
What I wouldn't give
to see that in a tight sweater.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.791
Herm, can I use that?

15:35.208 --> 15:36.375
I need a status report.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.291
Boys. Come on in.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.333
Make yourselves at home.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.833
Now, you all know Joe von Sternberg.

15:48.583 --> 15:51.708
You wanted 72 hours, you got 72 hours.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.333
Tell us what you have so far.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.875
Ben, why don't you start?

15:57.958 --> 16:00.208
Well, this was tough, David.

16:00.291 --> 16:03.291
In the beginning,
we couldn't agree on an approach.

16:03.375 --> 16:04.375
Really? Why was that?

16:04.458 --> 16:08.291
Well, we see a different kind
of Paramount picture.

16:08.375 --> 16:09.250
Different how?

16:10.333 --> 16:13.875
Frankenstein and The Wolf Man
all rolled into one, only--

16:13.958 --> 16:16.541
I don't make cheap horror pictures.
Universal does.

16:16.625 --> 16:20.208
This is different.
This is about something.

16:21.750 --> 16:22.750
Okay…

16:23.750 --> 16:24.833
Sidney.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.875
Imagine a mad scientist,

16:28.958 --> 16:33.625
touring the boonies
with a mechanical freak he's fabricated.

16:33.708 --> 16:35.333
What does he mean, "fabricated"?

16:35.416 --> 16:38.583
And displays it to superstitious hayseeds

16:38.666 --> 16:42.500
in a giant, silk-lined casket
for the price of admission.

16:42.583 --> 16:48.875
But, every full moon, the monster awakens
and raises unholy hell with the villagers.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.916
Give it a Eastern European look.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.875
Men in leather shorts,
gals in tattered peasant blouses.

16:53.958 --> 16:57.125
-They think it's the devil?
-Villagers always think it's the devil.

16:57.208 --> 17:00.125
And the scientist and his creation
are forced to flee

17:00.208 --> 17:02.041
during a raging electrical storm.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.541
Flee from outraged peasants…

17:04.625 --> 17:06.166
Who pursue them mit torches…

17:06.250 --> 17:08.000
Overturn their creaky wagon…

17:08.083 --> 17:09.375
And set fire to it.

17:10.750 --> 17:14.291
Tell him about the finale, Charlie.

17:19.916 --> 17:20.791
Well…

17:21.958 --> 17:24.500
the rain turns to sleet,

17:25.083 --> 17:29.083
puts out the fire,
and entombs the monster in solid ice.

17:31.208 --> 17:35.583
While, nearby, an old priest weeps.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.166
A weeping priest?

17:40.250 --> 17:42.666
Thunder, lightning, blood,

17:42.750 --> 17:44.625
fire, religion…

17:44.708 --> 17:45.666
All in one film?

17:45.750 --> 17:47.500
And with an unseasonal thaw,

17:48.333 --> 17:49.458
a sequel.

17:49.958 --> 17:52.833
You said this was about something,
this was different.

17:52.916 --> 17:55.916
Plus, the ominous futility
of man playing God.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.916
The Faustian bargain of life everlasting.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.583
The triumph of the human spirit

18:00.666 --> 18:04.208
over the beast incarnate
in our far-too-solid flesh.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.500
It's director-proof.

18:06.583 --> 18:07.458
Joe.

18:08.375 --> 18:09.208
B picture.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.708
It's not for Joe. Boys, this is serious.

18:11.791 --> 18:12.916
We need your help.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.500
We've got to get people
into theaters, but…

18:16.750 --> 18:17.583
how?

18:22.083 --> 18:24.041
Show movies in the streets.

18:28.208 --> 18:31.833
You okay, Charlie?
Taken care of this weekend?

18:31.916 --> 18:34.958
-I'm going to see my aunt.
-That sounds like fun.

18:35.041 --> 18:38.750
You obviously don't know my aunt.
If you're not doing anything, come along.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.250
Careful, I just might.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.791
Glendale station at 7:00.
Bring Sara if you like.

18:43.875 --> 18:46.375
-Who?
-Sara, isn't that your wife?

18:46.458 --> 18:49.000
Oh, you mean Poor Sara.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.250
No, she and the kids are back East.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.375
Herman.

19:15.958 --> 19:16.958
Herman.

19:22.958 --> 19:25.166
-Herm!
-Charlie!

20:38.625 --> 20:40.833
Cut! Next setup, please.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.708
What is Mank doing here?

20:51.708 --> 20:53.333
-Who?
-Herman Mankiewicz.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.833
-Do I know him?
-He wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.

20:58.916 --> 20:59.750
Mank!

21:01.625 --> 21:05.875
-Thalberg, the boy genius.
-I am shocked to see you here.

21:05.958 --> 21:10.833
I'd be shocked to see me here, too,
Irving, if only I knew where here was.

21:10.916 --> 21:13.791
-You wrote one of our Lon Chaneys.
-Among many.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.250
-Pictures?
-Writers.

21:15.333 --> 21:19.333
-At MGM, movies are a team sport, Mank.
-Which may be why I'm at Paramount.

21:19.416 --> 21:22.583
Since when don't Paramount
use writers by the truckload?

21:22.666 --> 21:26.125
But all at once, not in relays.
Helps spread the blame around.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.250
You remember our chairman, Louis B. Mayer?

21:28.333 --> 21:29.750
By reputation only.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.666
-Long night?
-A short one. Plagued by spirits.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.375
It's a hell of a way to spend
the Sabbath, fellas.

21:36.458 --> 21:38.000
Here in support of a friend.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.208
His leading lady is making
a mid-career adjustment.

21:41.291 --> 21:45.041
I'm on my way over.
Any notes from the oversight tent?

21:49.666 --> 21:52.000
-Who was that again?
-Just a writer.

21:54.750 --> 21:57.166
Slumming on a Saturday, Mr. Metcalf?

21:57.250 --> 21:59.916
Mank. No sir! Helping out on B camera.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.750
It's a home movie,
but his idea of a home movie.

22:02.833 --> 22:03.916
I know you.

22:04.708 --> 22:07.041
Well, what's at stake here?

22:07.541 --> 22:11.250
We met at John Gilbert's birthday.
You're Herman Mankiewicz.

22:11.333 --> 22:12.166
Guilty.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.125
And I remember you, Miss Davies.

22:15.875 --> 22:20.208
Regaling us with stories
about dodging trolley cars in Brooklyn.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.416
Your Flatbush was showing.

22:26.625 --> 22:29.916
You fractured Wally Beery's wrist
Indian wrestling.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.041
A lucky break.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.833
Boy, was he surprised.
You're stronger than you look.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.500
And from what I understand,
you're smarter.

22:37.583 --> 22:39.500
That was a compliment.

22:39.583 --> 22:42.125
-See what I mean?
-You are interesting.

22:42.208 --> 22:45.208
I need a favor,
but promise you won't laugh.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.500
Given the state of the world,
a tall order.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.916
I just know you are.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.083
I have got such a hangover right now,
there's just a fighting chance I won't.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.583
I'm being burned at the stake
and I am dying for a ciggie-boo.

22:58.791 --> 23:00.416
There. God's punishing you.

23:02.708 --> 23:05.208
Watch those stairs. They're treacherous.

23:05.708 --> 23:08.125
Every moment of my life is treacherous.

23:10.791 --> 23:12.166
Any last words?

23:12.958 --> 23:14.625
Welcome to San Simeon.

23:15.666 --> 23:16.625
I've written worse.

23:16.708 --> 23:20.666
-You've never seen it?
-No, but George Bernard Shaw was right.

23:21.791 --> 23:22.750
How's that?

23:23.375 --> 23:26.083
"It's what God might've built
had he had the money."

23:26.583 --> 23:30.583
Well, as they say in the Bronx,
"Make yourself to home," Mr. Mankiewicz.

23:30.666 --> 23:33.958
-Or shall I call you Herman?
-No. Please, call me Mank.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.250
-Good morning, Charles.
-Charlie.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.416
-Aunt Marion. Mank.
-You sleep well?

23:40.083 --> 23:42.083
Until your rather dramatic wake-up call.

23:42.166 --> 23:46.458
This is all Pops's idea.
He wants me ready to take on the talkies.

23:46.541 --> 23:47.791
First positions, please!

23:48.500 --> 23:49.916
Riders, ready!

23:51.000 --> 23:52.125
Rolling!

23:52.916 --> 23:55.333
-Speed.
-Speed! Action!

24:05.875 --> 24:09.541
Help! Please! Someone save me!

24:13.291 --> 24:14.291
Cut!

24:24.541 --> 24:28.875
Pops, this is Herman Mankiewicz,
but we have to call him Mank.

24:29.541 --> 24:30.458
Mankiewicz?

24:31.708 --> 24:35.458
Herman Mankiewicz,
New York playwright and drama critic?

24:35.541 --> 24:38.250
Turned humble screenwriter. Mr. Hearst.

24:38.333 --> 24:43.125
Why, no need to be humble, Mr. Mankiewicz.
Pictures that talk are the future.

24:43.208 --> 24:46.416
They're gonna need people who honor words,
give them voice.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.500
There's a golden age coming

24:48.583 --> 24:53.166
when all the world will be a stage,
and you, perhaps, their Shakespeare.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.958
I wouldn't have thought you'd be
that keenly interested

24:56.041 --> 24:57.416
in the honoring of words.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.416
What's so funny?

25:00.541 --> 25:04.666
I'm just surprised
that a vaunted muckraker like yourself

25:04.750 --> 25:07.958
sees Hollywood's future
as such a shiny penny.

25:08.458 --> 25:09.416
Back to one.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.500
Times are changing, Mr. Mankiewicz,

25:12.125 --> 25:14.416
and I'm not just referring
to this Depression.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.375
All that bother.

25:15.458 --> 25:16.875
And when all this is over,

25:16.958 --> 25:20.250
picture-makers are gonna have to service
this new entertainment.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.083
I intend to make pictures
with the help of real literary minds.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.291
I support that.

25:26.375 --> 25:28.458
Instead, what do most studios give us?

25:28.541 --> 25:30.958
Gangster flicks, zanies.

25:31.041 --> 25:32.041
Too true.

25:32.125 --> 25:35.125
Now, how many gangsters
do Americans meet in a lifetime?

25:35.750 --> 25:38.000
How many families
are like the Marx Brothers?

25:38.083 --> 25:39.625
You mean, besides my own?

25:40.833 --> 25:44.708
Very good. Have him seated next to me.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.416
Miss Davies, Mr. Hearst would like

25:50.500 --> 25:53.125
Mr. Mankiewicz seated
to his left at dinner.

25:55.666 --> 25:57.125
Pops likes you.

26:12.666 --> 26:14.750
Why is it when Houseman edits,

26:14.833 --> 26:18.875
everyone ends up speaking
like a constipated Oxford don?

26:23.875 --> 26:24.708
Hello.

26:25.416 --> 26:26.291
Yes, he is.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.375
No, not at all.

26:28.458 --> 26:29.375
Please hold on.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.458
It's Poor Sa--

26:31.416 --> 26:33.625
I'm sorry. It's your wife.

26:40.458 --> 26:42.375
-Schnutz.
-I heard that.

26:42.458 --> 26:44.666
Joe called four times
in the last three days.

26:44.750 --> 26:47.375
-He wants your number up there.
-So give it to him.

26:47.458 --> 26:48.541
Knock it off!

26:50.000 --> 26:51.208
The boys are remodeling.

26:51.291 --> 26:54.166
He seemed concerned about something.
Is everything okay?

26:54.250 --> 26:56.541
If I could swim, I'd be doing swimmingly.

26:56.625 --> 27:00.666
And don't mind Joe.
He's a worrisome old woman in disguise.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.458
Well, he wants to offer you work.

27:02.541 --> 27:04.708
Baby Joe, offering me?

27:06.666 --> 27:08.916
If he calls again, give him this number.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.041
I've gotta run. Kiss the offspring.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.500
I say…

27:19.208 --> 27:21.916
a letter from the gallant lieutenant.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.458
Now, let's hope
it makes more sense than the last.

27:25.541 --> 27:27.791
Fighters off the decks
of aircraft carriers.

27:27.875 --> 27:30.541
-Whoever had that idea?
-It's not good?

27:30.625 --> 27:31.750
Not good?

27:31.833 --> 27:34.208
German U-boats
are starting to hunt in packs,

27:34.291 --> 27:38.500
and a Stuka dive-bomber can drop one
down your stack from 500 feet.

27:39.083 --> 27:42.041
What's our valiant laddie
have to say for the cause--

27:57.375 --> 27:58.875
It's not from her husband.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.333
His ship's been sunk off Norway.

28:03.041 --> 28:04.500
Presumed lost at sea.

28:07.458 --> 28:10.166
Always the smartest guy in the room.

28:37.291 --> 28:38.416
You're right.

28:38.500 --> 28:42.833
Aircraft carriers are a shitty idea,
but I don't appreciate the callousness.

28:43.666 --> 28:45.375
I expect more of you.

28:48.250 --> 28:52.583
Presumed means they don't know,
so I choose to believe he's alive until…

28:55.291 --> 28:56.291
Mank.

28:58.875 --> 28:59.750
Mank.

29:01.083 --> 29:02.416
Mr. Mankiewicz?

29:22.500 --> 29:24.541
He's all right. Just sleeping.

29:25.291 --> 29:27.791
Well… I shouldn't wonder.

29:27.875 --> 29:31.750
There's enough Seconal in those bottles
to bring down a bull elephant in heat.

29:34.583 --> 29:37.000
Young Orson doesn't believe in chance.

30:01.750 --> 30:04.958
Houseman, you sly thing.
You slipped me a Mickey.

30:05.041 --> 30:06.041
So we did.

30:06.541 --> 30:08.958
How you reached it
so early in your rehabilitation,

30:09.041 --> 30:09.875
I cannot imagine.

30:09.958 --> 30:11.333
How was it? Mother's milk?

30:11.416 --> 30:15.416
On balance, better than nothing.
I plan to use it as a nightcap.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.750
As you Yanks say,
"He went out like a light."

30:17.833 --> 30:22.500
I couldn't have put it better myself,
which may be why I write for the movies.

30:22.583 --> 30:24.000
Will you stop?

30:24.083 --> 30:26.500
You write for the movies
because you're super at it.

30:26.583 --> 30:29.916
Excuse me, you two,
I've masses of typing to do.

30:31.833 --> 30:33.250
Seventy-six pages.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.833
By the time she translates
your chicken scratch,

30:35.916 --> 30:37.250
it'll be less than 40.

30:37.333 --> 30:38.833
At this rate, you'll never finish.

30:38.916 --> 30:41.583
What I wanna know is what you think of it.

30:41.666 --> 30:44.250
The writing is first-rate,
but you know that.

30:44.333 --> 30:47.208
His lust for power,
your evocation of his hunger for love

30:47.291 --> 30:49.166
from those who fear his worst side, but--

30:49.250 --> 30:51.291
The dreaded yet foreseeable "but."

30:51.375 --> 30:54.041
You're asking a lot
of a motion picture audience.

30:54.125 --> 30:57.666
-It's a bit of a jumble.
-Did you say "jumble" or "jungle"?

30:57.750 --> 30:59.333
A hodgepodge of talky episodes.

30:59.416 --> 31:03.416
Fragments that leap around in time
like Mexican jumping beans.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.958
Welcome to my mind, old sock.

31:05.041 --> 31:08.250
The story is so scattered,
I'm afraid one will need a road map.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.375
-You mean it's a mess.
-Would you consider simplifying?

31:11.458 --> 31:13.000
As Pascal once said,

31:13.083 --> 31:16.500
"If only I'd had more time,
I would have written a shorter letter."

31:16.583 --> 31:19.250
All I am saying is
no one can write like that.

31:19.333 --> 31:22.791
But I can write like that, Houseman.
I have.

31:22.875 --> 31:26.916
The narrative is one big circle,
like a cinnamon roll,

31:27.416 --> 31:30.791
not a straight line
pointing to the nearest exit.

31:30.875 --> 31:34.458
You cannot capture
a man's entire life in two hours.

31:34.541 --> 31:36.916
All you can hope
is to leave the impression of one.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.791
But nobody expects Shakespeare.

31:38.875 --> 31:42.791
People aren't spending
their hard-earned 25 cents to see Macbeth.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.166
Maestro the Dog-Faced Boy did Macbeth.

31:45.250 --> 31:48.291
Voodoo Macbeth.
Don't be fooled. He's a showman.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.625
Busker reveling in sleight of hand.

31:51.125 --> 31:53.333
Save yourself the trouble,
be done in 60 days.

31:53.416 --> 31:55.875
He'll get this,
and the audience will too.

31:55.958 --> 31:58.125
Stop worrying. Have a pickle.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.875
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

32:00.416 --> 32:02.250
Haven't been since we got here.

32:03.708 --> 32:04.541
Cheerio.

32:07.916 --> 32:10.916
Write hard. Aim low.

32:18.666 --> 32:19.875
Where were we, chief?

32:20.833 --> 32:21.958
What are you gonna do?

32:22.750 --> 32:23.958
-About what?
-He's right.

32:24.041 --> 32:25.791
You won't be done till Christmas.

32:25.875 --> 32:28.041
-What?
-You made a promise.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.875
-I did what?
-Sixty days is two weeks from now.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.250
Where were we?

32:39.166 --> 32:42.250
Bernstein's speech,
the young woman on the ferryboat.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.666
Read it back, please.

32:46.041 --> 32:49.708
"A white dress she had on,
and she was carrying a white parasol,

32:50.625 --> 32:55.000
and I only saw her for one second,
and she didn't see me at all."

32:56.125 --> 33:00.750
"But I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since
that I haven't thought of that girl."

33:02.708 --> 33:04.833
A snapshot
from the Mankiewicz family album?

33:04.916 --> 33:06.166
You might say that.

33:07.708 --> 33:09.750
It really is a gorgeous--

33:09.833 --> 33:11.375
Spot to get stuck?

33:14.708 --> 33:18.666
-Is Bernstein meant to be Louis Mayer?
-If form follows function.

33:18.750 --> 33:22.416
Mayer is the same pathetic sort of lapdog
to our Charles Foster?

33:22.500 --> 33:25.000
Bernstein is a far nicer character.

33:25.083 --> 33:27.125
You don't much like Mayer.

33:27.208 --> 33:29.541
If I ever go to the electric chair,

33:30.041 --> 33:32.625
I'd like him to be sitting in my lap.

33:38.083 --> 33:41.041
Seven-fifty a week?
That's half what you make, Herman.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.625
-You're a junior writer, Joe.
-So?

33:43.708 --> 33:46.166
So, you're only half the wit
your big brother is.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.625
-How many half-wits make that?
-Herm, how do I look?

33:50.333 --> 33:54.291
-You look like you. Fine.
-What should I be expecting?

33:54.375 --> 33:57.916
You're related to me.
He already thinks you're a genius.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Enough.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.166
The job will be yours
if you can do two things.

34:02.250 --> 34:06.125
One, don't roll your eyes.
Two, try not to fall asleep.

34:06.791 --> 34:08.208
This isn't Gower Gulch.

34:08.291 --> 34:10.708
You want I should make a picture
about a prostitute?

34:10.791 --> 34:13.750
What's wrong with that?
My mother was nothing but a whore.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.416
You would talk about
your own mother that way?

34:16.500 --> 34:19.083
The woman who gave you life?

34:19.166 --> 34:21.916
You ungrateful bastard!
I ought to cut your balls off!

34:22.000 --> 34:25.583
Do it, you fucking junk dealer!
I'll still be the better man!

34:29.333 --> 34:32.000
L.B., this is my brother, Joe.

34:32.083 --> 34:34.541
Nice to meet you, Joseph. I'm Louis Mayer.

34:34.625 --> 34:36.958
I can't tell you
what this means to him, Louis.

34:37.041 --> 34:41.250
-They're all there, Mr. Mayer.
-On my way. Joe, walk with me.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.291
My boy,
there are three work rules at this studio.

34:50.375 --> 34:53.916
Rule number one, ars gratia artis--
art for art's sake.

34:54.000 --> 34:54.916
How you doing?

34:55.000 --> 34:58.541
One million dollars a year
we spend on stories we never even film.

34:58.625 --> 35:02.250
Why not? I'll tell you.
They don't make me cry.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.833
What makes me cry? Emotion.

35:04.916 --> 35:06.958
Where do I feel emotion?

35:07.041 --> 35:09.625
Here, here, and here.

35:09.708 --> 35:10.833
Rule number two.

35:10.916 --> 35:14.000
You may have heard MGM
has more stars than the heavens.

35:14.083 --> 35:15.333
Do not believe this.

35:15.416 --> 35:19.250
Hiya. We have only one star.
That is Leo the Lion.

35:19.333 --> 35:20.625
Never forget that.

35:20.708 --> 35:23.583
Many stars have,
and now they twinkle elsewhere.

35:23.666 --> 35:24.708
Rule number three…

35:24.791 --> 35:28.458
People think MGM
stands for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

35:28.541 --> 35:29.625
It does not.

35:29.708 --> 35:34.375
It stands for Mayer's gantze mishpokhe,
Mayer's whole family.

35:34.458 --> 35:35.708
Never forget that.

35:35.791 --> 35:37.791
You got a problem, come to Papa.

35:38.458 --> 35:42.583
This is a business where the buyer
gets nothing for his money but a memory.

35:42.666 --> 35:45.583
What he bought
still belongs to the man who sold it.

35:45.666 --> 35:49.500
That's the real magic of the movies,
and don't let anybody tell you different.

36:11.625 --> 36:17.541
I find myself in a horrendous position,
and I come to all of you on bended knee.

36:19.458 --> 36:25.000
We are suffering, as all Americans are,
from our country's terrible economic woes.

36:25.791 --> 36:29.125
Good people, everyday people,
can't afford to go to the movies.

36:29.208 --> 36:33.125
So even our preeminent dream factory…

36:34.291 --> 36:36.875
is in grave financial difficulty.

36:38.916 --> 36:44.500
I am asking everyone in the MGM family
to take a painful step.

36:45.375 --> 36:47.916
I am asking to roll back salaries.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.375
I don't want to,

36:50.875 --> 36:55.625
but for this hallowed place
to continue to exist, I am forced to.

36:56.208 --> 37:00.291
I won't break up this family
over something like money.

37:01.125 --> 37:03.625
-How long are you asking for?
-Shouldn't be long.

37:03.708 --> 37:05.250
How much are you asking for?

37:05.333 --> 37:06.750
-Half.
-Half?

37:06.833 --> 37:09.458
-Could be less.
-Is everybody going to be pitching in?

37:09.541 --> 37:10.541
Are you, Mr. Mayer?

37:10.625 --> 37:13.958
Real families root for each other
in the good times,

37:14.041 --> 37:17.125
take care of each other in tough ones.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
We're with you, L.B.

37:19.083 --> 37:20.500
You may be, Mr. Barrymore,

37:20.583 --> 37:23.041
but a 50% pay cut
for grips and electricians--

37:23.125 --> 37:26.375
Eight weeks, my friends,
eight short weeks.

37:26.458 --> 37:31.125
As soon as FDR reopens the banks,
you'll get back every penny.

37:31.208 --> 37:36.541
On that,
you have the sacred word of L.B. Mayer.

37:44.333 --> 37:45.583
Well, I vote yes.

37:47.750 --> 37:50.375
-I do as well.
-Me too.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.708
-How'd I do, Ben?
-It was great, Mr. Mayer.

38:17.958 --> 38:21.208
Not even the most disgraceful thing
I've ever seen.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.250
Good.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.541
Okay.

38:33.208 --> 38:35.000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:35.083 --> 38:37.458
Yeah? Okay.

38:37.541 --> 38:39.125
Maybe a little bit left?

38:39.625 --> 38:41.375
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:41.458 --> 38:42.416
Here?

38:42.500 --> 38:45.416
-Yeah.
-I've got to get typewriter ribbon.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.250
-Here are this morning's pages.
-It's all dreck!

38:48.333 --> 38:50.291
Don't flagellate. At least you're writing.

38:50.375 --> 38:53.083
None of it sings. None of it. Not a note.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.750
You're not writing opera.

38:56.041 --> 38:57.041
Hello?

38:59.041 --> 39:00.708
But I am writing an opera.

39:03.916 --> 39:04.916
It's for you.

39:07.708 --> 39:09.708
-Yeah?
-Herman, it's Joe.

39:09.791 --> 39:11.750
Hey, kid. What's up?

39:11.833 --> 39:14.958
-Checking in. How are you getting around?
-Gingerly.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.375
-Any rest?
-Haven't seen a sunrise yet.

39:17.458 --> 39:19.375
You've never seen a sunrise.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.333
-Sara said you wanted this number.
-Just to hear your voice.

39:22.416 --> 39:26.416
She said you had some work
you wanted to talk about.

39:26.916 --> 39:30.291
I was thinking about that old play,

39:30.375 --> 39:32.875
The Wild Man of Borneo,
that you wrote in the Ice Age.

39:32.958 --> 39:36.375
One never remembers one's disasters.
It's considered gauche.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.625
A play is never a disaster
till the movies say it is.

39:39.708 --> 39:41.666
I brought it to my people at the studio.

39:41.750 --> 39:44.708
We want W.C. Fields,
and we want you to adapt.

39:44.791 --> 39:47.541
I'm kind of on something right now.

39:47.625 --> 39:50.458
I can get you paid for the play
and the adaptation.

39:50.958 --> 39:53.625
Sounds great,
but I'll have to think about it.

39:53.708 --> 39:55.500
These things have their moment.

39:55.583 --> 39:58.291
So, this isn't an offer.
It's a subtle ultimatum.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.333
Nobody could ever tell you what to do.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.083
Did Sara put you up to this?

40:04.166 --> 40:06.583
Not at all, but I know how things are.

40:06.666 --> 40:08.083
I can tell by her voice.

40:08.166 --> 40:11.041
-And how bad is that, baby brother?
-How bad?

40:11.125 --> 40:12.583
I went to a party last night

40:12.666 --> 40:16.458
where Scott Fitzgerald
referred to you as a ruined man.

40:16.541 --> 40:20.125
-That's how bad things can get.
-That's good. I may use that.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.041
Hermie--

40:21.125 --> 40:24.333
Please, stop, Joey.
Just tell me what's on your mind.

40:26.083 --> 40:28.791
I hear you're hunting dangerous game.

40:29.541 --> 40:34.291
Word on the street is radio's golden boy
wants to go toe-to-toe with Willie Hearst,

40:34.375 --> 40:36.375
and you're helping in the kitchen.

40:42.041 --> 40:43.416
-And?
-"And?"

40:45.125 --> 40:46.333
Herman, "And?"

40:46.416 --> 40:47.500
How stupid of me.

40:47.583 --> 40:50.916
I thought I was rejecting
a humiliating handout,

40:51.000 --> 40:54.208
when all the time,
I was nixing a respectable bribe.

40:54.291 --> 40:56.000
And I'm sorry I ever cared.

41:08.458 --> 41:09.458
Come on.

41:18.375 --> 41:21.875
Marion and I are so pleased
you could all come stay for the weekend.

41:22.375 --> 41:24.708
I hope the train ride wasn't too arduous.

41:25.833 --> 41:30.458
And tonight, we're celebrating
our great friend's birthday

41:30.541 --> 41:32.416
in our little hillside home.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.500
Charlie.

41:33.583 --> 41:37.458
Happy birthday to you

41:37.541 --> 41:41.083
Happy birthday to you

41:41.166 --> 41:45.208
Happy birthday, dear Louis

41:45.708 --> 41:49.166
Happy birthday to you

41:53.000 --> 41:56.750
Louis, you should be joyous.
You don't look a day over 48.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.500
I feel 35.

42:03.583 --> 42:06.791
Mr. Hearst, Marion, all of you,

42:07.333 --> 42:09.916
my heart is full to bursting.

42:10.958 --> 42:12.958
I can't express in words…

42:13.041 --> 42:14.791
Please don't try.

42:14.875 --> 42:21.250
W.R., nothing is more precious to me
than your friendship and sage advice.

42:21.333 --> 42:23.875
I am blessed to call you my friend.

42:25.416 --> 42:28.250
God bless William Randolph Hearst.

42:28.750 --> 42:30.375
God bless us, every one.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.041
-Hear, hear.
-A very happy birthday, Louis.

42:34.125 --> 42:37.708
Our country should be flattered
you picked its birth date as your own.

42:37.791 --> 42:41.250
The rest of us have to be satisfied
with the one we happened to be born on.

42:41.333 --> 42:42.250
Mank.

42:42.750 --> 42:46.375
Here's to your rich Canadian imagination.

42:46.458 --> 42:49.500
To rich Canadian imagination!

42:49.583 --> 42:50.916
Here's to banks reopening.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.875
-And to freedom.
-Freedom!

42:52.958 --> 42:55.708
I believe you've met
our distinguished guest,

42:55.791 --> 42:57.708
Mr. Rexford Tugwell.

42:57.791 --> 43:00.666
Now, Rex is special assistant
to President Roosevelt.

43:00.750 --> 43:03.916
And we're all interested
in what you might share with us.

43:04.500 --> 43:06.541
We all wanna welcome the Thalbergs

43:06.625 --> 43:09.583
back from Irving's long convalescence
in Europe.

43:09.666 --> 43:12.041
-Thank you, W.R.
-Good to see you, Irving.

43:12.125 --> 43:13.625
-Thank you, Mr. Hearst.
-Norma.

43:14.333 --> 43:16.041
Anybody seen anything good lately?

43:16.125 --> 43:18.083
I just saw 42nd Street.

43:18.166 --> 43:20.125
It blew my wig!

43:20.208 --> 43:22.041
You can take the girl outta Bed-Stuy.

43:22.125 --> 43:24.666
-When was that?
-Over the weekend.

43:24.750 --> 43:27.333
You were in D.C.
I went to the pictures in Santa Barbara.

43:27.416 --> 43:29.166
We have a fine screening room here.

43:29.250 --> 43:32.291
Warner's picture?
Why waste money on that?

43:32.375 --> 43:34.583
-Next time, I'll go with you.
-Of course.

43:34.666 --> 43:39.166
I am bonkers about Movietone News.
I love Lowell Thomas's voice.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.250
Is he single?

43:41.500 --> 43:43.916
I sat across from him
at the Brown Derby once.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.250
-He bought me a drink.
-He didn't!

43:46.333 --> 43:47.500
Not technically.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.375
But I made sure
to run into him in the parking lot after.

43:50.458 --> 43:53.541
-I asked him, "Do you need a lift?"
-You didn't! What did he say?

43:53.625 --> 43:56.916
-I'll never tell.
-There's a point to this, dear?

43:57.000 --> 44:01.666
Well, yes, they showed that Hitler
giving a speech, kissing babies.

44:01.750 --> 44:03.166
He is creepers!

44:03.250 --> 44:06.250
Lederhosen and suspenders. Terrifying.

44:06.333 --> 44:08.708
No, it's the mustache that's the horror.

44:08.791 --> 44:11.458
Don't be alarmed, Marion.
He won't be around for long.

44:11.541 --> 44:14.541
The Germans
are a thoughtful, considerate people.

44:14.625 --> 44:16.291
Enough about Nazis.

44:16.375 --> 44:18.583
Irving, tell us about your travels.

44:18.666 --> 44:19.750
Where were you?

44:20.916 --> 44:22.333
Berlin, in fact.

44:23.041 --> 44:24.333
But it was interesting.

44:24.416 --> 44:27.541
Thugs in brown shirts
goose-stepping past our hotel all night,

44:27.625 --> 44:29.333
screaming anti-Semitic slogans.

44:29.416 --> 44:30.791
I was terrified.

44:30.875 --> 44:32.666
This Hitler sounds like a drip.

44:32.750 --> 44:35.416
Shouldn't the United States
do something, Mr. Tugwell?

44:35.500 --> 44:37.125
We are weighing all options.

44:37.208 --> 44:40.041
Can't last.
Who takes a lunatic like that seriously?

44:40.125 --> 44:42.666
The last time I looked,
40 million Germans.

44:42.750 --> 44:45.250
Mank! You're always
so wonderfully contrary.

44:45.333 --> 44:50.125
"Chase &amp; Sanborn's der coffee.
Can 40 million Nazis all be wrong?"

44:50.208 --> 44:53.333
I just read they've opened
their first concentration camps

44:53.416 --> 44:54.916
and started burning books.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.791
-What's next? Movies?
-Enough.

44:57.875 --> 45:00.000
-Is that true, Irving?
-Yes, L.B.

45:00.916 --> 45:02.250
Hitler, Schmitler!

45:02.916 --> 45:05.000
You don't turn your back on
a market as big as Germany.

45:05.083 --> 45:08.875
Please. It's upsetting enough
Marion had to endure the man in newsreel.

45:08.958 --> 45:10.583
What's a concentration camp?

45:10.666 --> 45:12.958
It was fascinating.
Those people adore him.

45:14.916 --> 45:18.541
-I'm probably talking nonsense.
-You're the first tonight that isn't.

45:18.625 --> 45:21.125
Speaking of socialists,
how about Sinclair's book?

45:21.208 --> 45:24.250
He wants to turn private enterprise
over to the state.

45:24.333 --> 45:26.125
There's one we won't be optioning.

45:26.208 --> 45:27.583
It's selling like crazy.

45:27.666 --> 45:30.541
Walter Winchell says Sinclair
may run for governor.

45:30.625 --> 45:33.666
That rat Bolshevik
belongs right up there with Hitler

45:33.750 --> 45:36.583
on the list of people
not to be taken seriously.

45:36.666 --> 45:39.041
There's a world of difference
between communism and socialism.

45:39.125 --> 45:42.666
-They both want something for nothing.
-Like a workforce for free?

45:42.750 --> 45:44.416
Half, and only in the interim.

45:44.500 --> 45:47.041
It's safe to assume
none of us here would welcome

45:47.125 --> 45:50.125
a crusading socialist
as California's political savior.

45:50.208 --> 45:52.666
Certainly not FDR. Am I right, Rex?

45:52.750 --> 45:55.375
Off the record,
President says the man bears watching.

45:55.458 --> 45:58.916
Especially now that Republicans
seem bent on running Frank Merriam again.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.750
Sinclair's run twice before
and got, what, 2% of the vote?

46:01.833 --> 46:05.750
-Good people, the man is an author.
-As was Thomas Jefferson.

46:05.833 --> 46:09.500
Come now, Mank.
Upton Sinclair as Thomas Jefferson?

46:09.583 --> 46:10.958
No, you're right, W.R.

46:11.041 --> 46:14.375
Jefferson never got federal laws
passed to ban oil monopolies,

46:14.458 --> 46:17.541
the railroad trusts,
or cleaned up the stockyards.

46:17.625 --> 46:20.958
-He's an angry scribe, a provocateur.
-Because he provokes thought.

46:21.041 --> 46:22.916
You always side with the writer, Mank.

46:23.416 --> 46:26.625
Poor souls surviving a depression
on five grand a week.

46:26.708 --> 46:28.125
-Commies.
-L.B. is not wrong.

46:28.208 --> 46:29.916
Irving, you're a literate man.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.750
You know the difference
between communism and socialism.

46:32.833 --> 46:35.000
In socialism, everyone shares the wealth.

46:35.083 --> 46:37.458
In communism, everyone shares the poverty.

46:37.541 --> 46:39.041
Thank you, Mr. Mankiewicz.

46:39.125 --> 46:43.000
Upton just wants you to apportion
some of your Christmas bonus, Irving,

46:43.083 --> 46:45.041
to the people who clean your house.

46:46.166 --> 46:48.583
Now, that's why I always want Mank around.

46:48.666 --> 46:49.625
Me too.

46:49.708 --> 46:52.708
Upton? Nobody's asking
to hear you sing "The Internationale."

46:54.250 --> 46:57.250
-What's that?
-The Communist national anthem, darling.

46:57.333 --> 46:59.750
I would. Do you sing?

46:59.833 --> 47:02.208
No one should have to hear me sing.
Right, Sara?

47:02.291 --> 47:03.458
If at all possible.

47:03.541 --> 47:05.625
As Republican state chairman-elect,

47:05.708 --> 47:08.250
I'm telling you,
nothing's going to happen here.

47:08.333 --> 47:11.333
The people who count
in California won't let it.

47:11.833 --> 47:14.625
All this talk
is so much pissing in the wind.

47:14.708 --> 47:15.583
Nicely put.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.125
I heard Pops on the phone
helping to pick the president's cabinet

47:19.208 --> 47:20.416
like casting a movie.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.708
They can stop a guy like Sinclair.

47:22.791 --> 47:23.916
Couldn't you, Pops?

47:27.166 --> 47:28.166
Pardon.

47:30.250 --> 47:32.041
I don't know what I'm saying.

47:45.333 --> 47:46.250
Go.

48:06.708 --> 48:08.250
Hello, Tokyo?

48:10.375 --> 48:12.000
London, you there?

48:13.208 --> 48:14.333
Nerts!

48:14.416 --> 48:17.791
-What is that?
-Pops's radio-phones.

48:17.875 --> 48:20.333
Never ever be out of touch
with your empire.

48:20.416 --> 48:22.750
No, what's "nerts"?

48:22.833 --> 48:25.125
Nerts is Brooklynese for "nuts."

48:25.708 --> 48:26.708
Jeepers!

48:36.250 --> 48:38.541
What did I do that was so terrible?

48:39.250 --> 48:42.208
I shouldn't have said that
about the cabinet in front of Tugwell,

48:42.291 --> 48:45.750
but since when does anybody care
what I have to say?

48:45.833 --> 48:48.125
Those things just pop out of my mouth,

48:48.208 --> 48:51.458
and the moment they do,
I feel like…

48:51.541 --> 48:53.541
Like you got caught, jambes en l'air.

48:54.541 --> 48:55.375
No!

48:56.208 --> 49:00.250
Well, do you always
just say whatever you think?

49:02.458 --> 49:04.000
You're blushing.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.833
-Am not.
-Are, too.

49:05.916 --> 49:10.250
-Am not.
-Are, too. I can see it even in the dark.

49:10.333 --> 49:11.875
Well, what can I tell you, Mank?

49:11.958 --> 49:15.958
Marion Douras went to convent school.

49:16.041 --> 49:18.750
Hedda! Louella!

49:18.833 --> 49:21.500
Where's a gossip columnist
when you need one?

49:22.291 --> 49:25.416
I hate shop talk.
I never know what's going on.

49:26.291 --> 49:29.708
The one thing you never ever talk about
is Upton Sinclair.

49:29.791 --> 49:31.083
I noted.

49:31.166 --> 49:33.708
The moment he's mentioned,
the evening turns.

49:33.791 --> 49:36.416
-It's sort of a sore subject.
-Really?

49:37.666 --> 49:38.708
Do tell.

49:42.375 --> 49:44.750
I don't even know
who this Mr. Sinclair is,

49:44.833 --> 49:46.750
but he wrote about us for a book.

49:47.250 --> 49:49.375
I used to quote it word for word.

49:50.041 --> 49:54.375
"I saw our richest newspaper publisher
keep his movie mistress

49:54.458 --> 49:57.750
in a private city
of palaces and cathedrals,

49:57.833 --> 50:01.625
furnished with shiploads
of junk imported from Europe

50:01.708 --> 50:07.000
and surrounded by vast acres
reserved for use by zebras and giraffes,

50:07.083 --> 50:10.916
telling in jest
that he had spent six million dollars

50:11.000 --> 50:13.208
to make his lady's reputation

50:13.291 --> 50:16.291
and using his newspapers
to celebrate her change of hats."

50:16.875 --> 50:20.250
It must be hard
to be on the receiving end of that.

50:20.333 --> 50:22.791
People think because you're
on the cover of Modern Screen,

50:22.875 --> 50:24.000
they know you.

50:25.125 --> 50:27.666
Nerts! What do I have to complain about?

50:27.750 --> 50:30.583
I live in a fishbowl,
but anything I want is mine.

50:31.416 --> 50:35.250
If I could, I'd share with everyone.
You know that, Mank.

50:35.750 --> 50:38.916
This Upton doesn't know
a thing about the real…

50:40.750 --> 50:46.500
Nobody, but nobody, makes a monkey
out of William Randolph Hearst!

50:47.708 --> 50:49.958
I understand why Mayer loathes him.

50:50.041 --> 50:53.916
-Why?
-Sinclair caught him with his pants down.

50:54.416 --> 50:55.250
Yikes!

50:55.333 --> 50:59.166
He wrote that Mayer took a bribe
to look the other way

50:59.250 --> 51:01.375
so a rival could buy MGM.

51:02.375 --> 51:05.208
-It's complicated.
-Over my head?

51:05.291 --> 51:08.416
No, over mine.
You'd need a degree in larceny.

51:08.500 --> 51:11.750
-Isn't bribery a crime?
-That's what Sinclair said.

51:11.833 --> 51:14.416
The little sausage
might have gone to jail.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.125
Jeepers!

51:16.208 --> 51:17.583
The hypocrisy.

51:18.083 --> 51:20.833
"Mayn gantze mishpokhe. My mishpokhe."

51:20.916 --> 51:23.708
-I don't speak a lot of Jewish.
-Really?

51:24.208 --> 51:26.333
"My mishpokhe. My family."

51:26.833 --> 51:30.166
Everything he does is for family,

51:30.250 --> 51:32.500
except when it comes
to selling his last name

51:32.583 --> 51:34.791
to a competitor
in the middle of the night.

51:36.041 --> 51:37.958
He would do that to his own studio?

51:38.500 --> 51:41.875
He doesn't own MGM
any more than Sam Goldwyn.

51:41.958 --> 51:44.083
They just run it
for the moneyboys back East.

51:44.916 --> 51:49.291
And jail is not something
an animal like Mayer is likely to forget.

51:53.541 --> 51:55.166
Irving must be clean.

51:55.250 --> 51:57.458
He looks like he shaves three times a day.

51:58.208 --> 52:00.875
Well, there's clean, and there's clean.

52:01.583 --> 52:04.125
Irving bought one of Sinclair's novels.

52:04.750 --> 52:09.291
Sinclair demanded a guarantee
that not one word could be changed,

52:09.375 --> 52:12.375
in writing,
on the back of the purchase check.

52:12.916 --> 52:15.750
He didn't want notes from Irving Thalberg?

52:15.833 --> 52:19.208
When Thalberg refused,
Sinclair took his money

52:19.291 --> 52:23.666
and ran off to Mexico and financed
a picture about the Russian Revolution.

52:26.791 --> 52:29.416
Now, that's sticking the old neck out.

52:40.166 --> 52:42.666
I'm sorry. Instinct!

52:43.166 --> 52:44.250
My fault.

52:45.333 --> 52:47.791
I've been
a little sixes and sevens recently.

52:48.791 --> 52:51.166
Tell me something, Mank. The truth.

52:52.833 --> 52:54.125
Could you see me playing

52:54.208 --> 52:56.583
Elizabeth Barrett Browning
or Marie Antoinette?

52:56.666 --> 53:00.833
Irving's bought 'em both.
You know, because of Pops.

53:02.125 --> 53:03.125
What do you think?

53:03.708 --> 53:05.416
And honestly.

53:07.958 --> 53:10.000
I see you more as Dulcinea.

53:10.583 --> 53:12.416
-Who?
-Dulcinea.

53:12.500 --> 53:14.708
From the Spanish, for sweetness.

53:16.791 --> 53:18.875
"Her hair, gold."

53:19.750 --> 53:21.416
"Her cheeks, roses."

53:21.500 --> 53:22.666
Nice.

53:22.750 --> 53:24.666
"Her lips, coral."

53:25.875 --> 53:28.041
"Her neck, alabaster."

53:28.541 --> 53:30.083
"Her bosom, marble."

53:30.166 --> 53:32.250
Marble? Maybe once.

53:32.958 --> 53:37.250
"Ivory, her hands,
and her whiteness, snow."

53:38.083 --> 53:42.041
-You wrote that?
-No. A fella named Cervantes.

53:43.250 --> 53:45.750
"There are meters
of accent and meters of tone,

53:45.833 --> 53:48.666
but the best of all meters
is to meet her alone."

53:49.333 --> 53:53.416
-A poem with a message.
-That's just the first verse.

53:53.958 --> 53:54.875
The last?

53:56.291 --> 53:58.958
"There are letters of accent

53:59.041 --> 54:00.666
and letters of tone,

54:00.750 --> 54:03.375
but the best of all letters
is to let her alone."

54:06.125 --> 54:08.166
Now, those, I wrote.

54:58.666 --> 54:59.708
Do come in.

55:02.916 --> 55:04.958
Jesus! What is that?

55:05.041 --> 55:06.875
Sunlight. It's nearly noon.

55:06.958 --> 55:09.916
Mother of God! Where did the night go?

55:11.083 --> 55:14.916
-Your support device is here.
-Good. Send it in.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.333
As is Mr. Houseman.

55:18.875 --> 55:20.458
What would you like me to do?

55:21.125 --> 55:22.708
Well, send him in, too.

55:38.875 --> 55:40.750
Put it over there, please.

55:41.791 --> 55:44.750
-You're early.
-I thought we should talk.

55:45.333 --> 55:47.750
-Why are you wearing a coat?
-I always wear a coat.

55:47.833 --> 55:49.375
Must be 108 degrees.

55:49.458 --> 55:51.791
We're at a Rubicon moment, Mank.

55:51.875 --> 55:54.791
It's not the work.
That's everything we hoped it would be.

55:54.875 --> 55:57.333
-Enough room there?
-It should be.

55:58.958 --> 56:00.416
I'm sorry, John.

56:01.750 --> 56:04.000
-You've only written 90 pages.
-Ninety-one.

56:04.083 --> 56:07.041
In my expert opinion,
you're hardly out of the first act.

56:07.125 --> 56:09.250
I mean,
how do you hope to be done in 14…

56:10.250 --> 56:11.625
13 days?

56:11.708 --> 56:14.458
We gave him our solemn word
we would deliver.

56:14.541 --> 56:17.375
-"We"?
-I don't think he's going to take it well.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.708
You said 90 days. Welles said 60.

56:19.791 --> 56:21.583
I'm doing the very best I can.

56:21.666 --> 56:25.416
-We are surely to be axed.
-Not just yet.

56:26.666 --> 56:27.875
I've never been fired.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.500
-I've never not been fired.
-I don't get fired.

56:31.583 --> 56:33.875
It's not as unpleasant
as you might imagine.

56:33.958 --> 56:36.000
You worry too much, John.

56:36.083 --> 56:37.875
What do you do for pleasure?

56:38.875 --> 56:39.750
Hello?

56:40.416 --> 56:41.541
Yes, he's here.

56:44.041 --> 56:44.958
It's Orson.

56:47.125 --> 56:50.041
-Will you talk?
-He'd like to speak with Mr. Houseman.

56:51.083 --> 56:51.916
Me?

56:59.333 --> 57:00.166
Orson.

57:02.083 --> 57:04.333
I came early to see where we were with…

57:05.416 --> 57:08.875
No, not at all.
Everything's going absolutely according…

57:09.916 --> 57:12.708
Well, that's difficult to say exactly.

57:13.250 --> 57:15.416
Yep. Yes, I know the clock…

57:17.375 --> 57:19.708
Well, as I've told you, it's quite unique.

57:19.791 --> 57:21.500
In fact, I'd say one of the most…

57:24.333 --> 57:27.541
Yes, well,
it will absolutely need your marvelous…

57:29.041 --> 57:31.666
He's on the mend and working tirelessly.

57:33.291 --> 57:34.541
Of course. When?

57:36.000 --> 57:39.250
I'm on my way.
Yes. Hang on, he's right here.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.458
He wants to see me right away.
Wouldn't tell me why.

57:45.291 --> 57:46.500
Perhaps he will you.

57:52.541 --> 57:53.541
Orson!

57:54.208 --> 57:55.666
Tell me what's up, Mank.

57:56.166 --> 57:57.500
He's getting on my nerves.

57:57.583 --> 57:59.666
I sensed that.
I told him I had to see him.

57:59.750 --> 58:02.083
Hopefully, I can think of a reason
before he gets here.

58:02.166 --> 58:04.458
I've finished
my test for Heart of Darkness.

58:04.541 --> 58:06.708
I'm turning my attention
to our project.

58:06.791 --> 58:08.083
"Let there be light."

58:08.166 --> 58:12.041
-Tell me what to expect.
-I thought you'd want to be surprised.

58:12.125 --> 58:14.875
You're always surprising.
That's why you were my only choice.

58:14.958 --> 58:19.125
No one else is Mankiewicz.
I can almost hear the finish line.

58:19.208 --> 58:22.333
-We're about to turn a corner.
-Unto the breach!

58:23.708 --> 58:25.291
Slim, you may tote

58:25.375 --> 58:27.208
those lovely highland beauties
to the kitchen.

58:27.291 --> 58:29.416
Fraulein Freda, empty the Mickeys

58:29.500 --> 58:32.416
and start replacing
their contents. Raus. Schnell.

58:35.083 --> 58:37.041
-Thank you, Slim. You may go.
-Slim.

58:44.250 --> 58:48.125
Mr. Mankiewicz, please don't ask us
to help you in this sad deception.

58:48.208 --> 58:49.583
My dear Mrs. Alexander,

58:49.666 --> 58:52.291
Charlie Lederer and I
went to a great deal of trouble

58:52.375 --> 58:54.583
to engineer this sad deception.

58:54.666 --> 58:57.625
My deadline is two weeks away,
and I intend--

58:57.708 --> 58:59.291
It could mean our jobs.

58:59.375 --> 59:03.750
I do my best thinking
before I fall asleep.

59:03.833 --> 59:06.750
And I am sick and tired
of having my evenings end

59:06.833 --> 59:10.041
with the abrupt sensation
of being struck on the head

59:10.125 --> 59:11.500
with a croquet mallet.

59:11.583 --> 59:13.875
-A way to put it.
-I'm not asking you to help.

59:13.958 --> 59:15.916
-You're not?
-I am telling you.

59:17.708 --> 59:21.708
I'm sorry. I won't be bullied.
You'll have my resignation in the morning.

59:21.791 --> 59:24.625
I know Fraulein Freda's been
sneaking you nightcaps.

59:24.708 --> 59:27.166
If she continues
to cooperate in this cheap ruse,

59:27.250 --> 59:29.083
I shall report the both of you.

59:29.166 --> 59:31.416
-Fraulein Freda.
-Ja, Herr Mank?

59:31.500 --> 59:34.125
-Please do as I instructed.
-Ja, Herr Mank.

59:51.166 --> 59:53.125
You mustn't let him intimidate you.

59:54.458 --> 59:56.625
I'm not intimidated, Frau Alexander.

59:56.708 --> 59:57.916
Then, why?

1:00:02.625 --> 1:00:05.375
Herr Mank sponsored
my family's entry into this country.

1:00:05.458 --> 1:00:09.666
He's responsible for us getting safely
out of Germany, legally and financially.

1:00:10.375 --> 1:00:13.250
-Really?
-Our entire village, he brought here.

1:00:14.250 --> 1:00:15.833
Entire village?

1:00:15.916 --> 1:00:17.458
Over 100 people.

1:00:19.083 --> 1:00:21.125
Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister,

1:00:21.208 --> 1:00:24.166
will not allow his films
to be shown in the Fatherland.

1:00:25.291 --> 1:00:26.875
I didn't realize.

1:00:27.375 --> 1:00:31.750
He wrote a picture about the Nazis
which no studio anywhere will dare make.

1:00:32.958 --> 1:00:37.291
I assume if he wishes to drink,
he's a grown man, a good man,

1:00:37.791 --> 1:00:39.333
and should be treated as such.

1:00:40.666 --> 1:00:41.791
Nicht wahr?

1:00:54.166 --> 1:00:56.750
To Mank-town. Or is it Mank-ville?

1:00:59.958 --> 1:01:00.958
Dear Freda.

1:01:02.083 --> 1:01:04.416
What's German for blabbermouth?

1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:06.583
Either you demonstrate
you can handle this,

1:01:06.666 --> 1:01:08.541
or we will all end up getting sacked.

1:01:08.625 --> 1:01:11.833
There's nothing like
a vote of confidence from one's peers.

1:01:11.916 --> 1:01:13.875
To Mank-berg. Prosit.

1:01:13.958 --> 1:01:16.666
Mank-heim. Bottoms up.

1:01:33.208 --> 1:01:36.291
Hey, Mank, you remember me?

1:01:36.375 --> 1:01:39.750
Oh, my God. Of course I remember you, C.C.

1:01:39.833 --> 1:01:42.791
C.C. for Central Casting.
How you been, Mank?

1:01:42.875 --> 1:01:43.833
What happened?

1:01:43.916 --> 1:01:46.458
"What happened?"
The goddamn Depression happened.

1:01:46.541 --> 1:01:49.333
I ain't had so much
as a walk-on since Tugboat Annie.

1:01:49.833 --> 1:01:51.541
Listen, I hate to, you know…

1:01:51.625 --> 1:01:54.791
Yeah. Ed, lend me a buck.

1:02:02.958 --> 1:02:07.125
Me and Grady here
been thinking of bummin' east to Miami.

1:02:07.625 --> 1:02:10.875
I heard from someone the Hollywood studios
are moving to Florida.

1:02:10.958 --> 1:02:14.166
-Who told you that?
-I can't say, but somebody in the know.

1:02:14.250 --> 1:02:16.500
In certain echelons,
it's common knowledge.

1:02:16.583 --> 1:02:18.500
Well, people in certain echelons

1:02:18.583 --> 1:02:21.416
don't usually trust me
with sensitive information.

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:25.833
But the studios aren't moving anywhere.
That's company-town propaganda.

1:02:25.916 --> 1:02:29.000
Believe what you want,
but, say, you think you could spare…

1:02:31.083 --> 1:02:32.000
Ed?

1:02:34.708 --> 1:02:36.125
Bless you, Mank.

1:02:36.208 --> 1:02:38.416
The bastard reneged. You were there.

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:40.166
Yes, he reinstated salaries,

1:02:40.250 --> 1:02:42.541
but he never gave back the money
he promised.

1:02:42.625 --> 1:02:43.833
Giant surprise.

1:02:43.916 --> 1:02:47.666
Come on, Mank. We need guys like you
to keep people like Mayer honest.

1:02:47.750 --> 1:02:50.250
I'd refer you, for that,
to the power of prayer.

1:02:50.333 --> 1:02:52.166
The Writers Guild
doesn't have to hit the bricks

1:02:52.250 --> 1:02:54.125
for the $2,500-a-week guy.

1:02:54.208 --> 1:02:56.583
We're doing it
for the $250-a-week guy.

1:02:56.666 --> 1:03:01.208
Joe, all the $250-a-week writers
I know are getting $2,500.

1:03:01.791 --> 1:03:04.958
Stop crying for your just deserts.
They're liable to give them to you.

1:03:05.041 --> 1:03:07.333
Then we'll all be working
for 75 bucks a week.

1:03:07.416 --> 1:03:09.333
I don't know
if you've walked a picket line.

1:03:09.416 --> 1:03:11.916
-You might have to.
-And Dave Chasen will cater.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.583
"Junior writers only paid $750 a week."

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:17.875
If that happens, you'd better run

1:03:17.958 --> 1:03:21.541
before real folk
with real troubles stone you to death.

1:03:22.916 --> 1:03:26.083
Hermie, the guild's in its infancy.

1:03:26.166 --> 1:03:27.833
-It needs you.
-You're telling me.

1:03:27.916 --> 1:03:29.541
What writer failed to notice

1:03:29.625 --> 1:03:32.291
the Screen Writers Guild
needs an apostrophe?

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.791
As Groucho always said,

1:03:34.875 --> 1:03:36.333
"Never belong to any club

1:03:36.416 --> 1:03:38.833
that would have someone like you
for a member."

1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:41.583
And look at him.

1:03:42.083 --> 1:03:44.833
The most miserable bastard
on God's green earth.

1:03:44.916 --> 1:03:48.541
I'd tell him you said that,
only he'd think you were brownnosing.

1:04:01.875 --> 1:04:02.708
Close the door.

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:08.041
Summer.

1:04:08.125 --> 1:04:11.541
Inez, you are not to let
the brothers Marx wait in my office.

1:04:11.625 --> 1:04:13.750
They've been grilling hot dogs again.

1:04:14.916 --> 1:04:15.750
Sit down.

1:04:32.750 --> 1:04:33.833
You wanted to see me?

1:04:33.916 --> 1:04:34.875
Not that I care,

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:38.625
but why aren't you contributing
to MGM's anti-Sinclair fund?

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:40.416
Well, call me old-fashioned,

1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:43.916
but I don't like being told
which side of a fight I'm already on.

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.333
How's it gonna look
if the GOP chairman himself

1:04:46.416 --> 1:04:48.791
can't get unanimous support
from his own studio?

1:04:51.375 --> 1:04:52.583
You're serious.

1:04:52.666 --> 1:04:54.000
I was taught by my parents

1:04:54.083 --> 1:04:56.625
to be straightforward,
to ask simply for what I want,

1:04:56.708 --> 1:04:59.166
and expect
that I may have to elucidate my position.

1:04:59.250 --> 1:05:01.583
I was encouraged by mine
to use my imagination,

1:05:01.666 --> 1:05:03.958
but I taught myself
to avoid the consequences.

1:05:04.041 --> 1:05:05.583
It's ten bucks, Mank.

1:05:06.291 --> 1:05:08.833
You piss that away between hopeless bets.

1:05:08.916 --> 1:05:11.958
I hate to think what L.B. might do
if he knew you were the only holdout.

1:05:12.625 --> 1:05:16.083
-I am, and he doesn't?
-And we're not gonna tell him.

1:05:19.041 --> 1:05:22.041
-I could let you go for this.
-It is a hanging offense.

1:05:22.125 --> 1:05:24.458
But I'll add the amount
to your gambling debt

1:05:24.541 --> 1:05:26.625
and forget we ever had this conversation.

1:05:26.708 --> 1:05:30.291
You do that…
and the brand-spanking-new Writers Guild

1:05:30.375 --> 1:05:33.708
might find it very interesting,
not to mention the newspapers.

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:36.708
I'm not sure the guild
intends to cover games of chance.

1:05:36.791 --> 1:05:41.208
And you won't go to the press,
because in California, that means Hearst.

1:05:41.291 --> 1:05:44.875
Irving, you are the shrewdest executive
in this town.

1:05:44.958 --> 1:05:48.291
Why are you acting
like some dumb ward heeler?

1:05:51.416 --> 1:05:53.125
You don't need my donation.

1:05:53.625 --> 1:05:57.541
You don't need anybody's.
You have everything it takes right here.

1:05:58.375 --> 1:05:59.333
Meaning?

1:06:01.416 --> 1:06:05.708
Meaning you can make the world swear
King Kong is ten stories tall

1:06:05.791 --> 1:06:08.125
and Mary Pickford, a virgin at 40.

1:06:08.833 --> 1:06:12.666
Yet, you can't convince
starving voters that a turncoat socialist

1:06:12.750 --> 1:06:15.416
is a menace
to everything Californians hold dear?

1:06:16.458 --> 1:06:18.000
You're barely trying.

1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:36.000
Millions of Californians
are being taxed out of their homes,

1:06:36.083 --> 1:06:38.458
yet the Depression is one of abundance.

1:06:38.541 --> 1:06:41.750
Fruit rots on the ground,
and vegetables are dumped into the ocean

1:06:41.833 --> 1:06:43.666
because there are no markets for them.

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:47.708
Aimee Semple McPherson says
you're a godless commie, Upton!

1:06:48.208 --> 1:06:52.416
Too often, sir, the religion
of Jesus is used by the ruling classes

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:55.791
to keep themselves in power
and the poor ever poorer.

1:06:55.875 --> 1:06:59.916
And that, my friends,
is a sin and an error.

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.458
I say, with Thomas Jefferson,

1:07:01.541 --> 1:07:06.958
"Truth has nothing to fear from error
where reason is left free to combat it."

1:07:08.958 --> 1:07:11.000
My friends, income in this country

1:07:11.083 --> 1:07:14.583
is going to be redistributed
by one of two methods,

1:07:14.666 --> 1:07:18.041
legal enactment or violent revolution.

1:07:18.125 --> 1:07:21.291
We haven't much longer
to exercise our choice.

1:07:21.375 --> 1:07:22.791
Thank you all for coming.

1:07:24.166 --> 1:07:26.083
Tell us about Hollywood!

1:07:26.166 --> 1:07:29.375
Are the studios really moving
to Florida like they've been saying?

1:07:29.458 --> 1:07:30.750
Absurd, sir.

1:07:30.833 --> 1:07:34.083
If they were serious,
why have the brothers Warner broken ground

1:07:34.166 --> 1:07:36.875
on an additional
100,000 square feet of sound stages,

1:07:37.458 --> 1:07:42.083
while MGM has the most contracts
with stars in their history?

1:07:42.583 --> 1:07:47.041
Well, he may not get Mayer's vote,
but he gets mine.

1:07:47.125 --> 1:07:48.458
…in California.

1:07:48.958 --> 1:07:50.416
Thank you all for coming.

1:07:56.333 --> 1:08:02.208
Well, I have seen some miracles in my day,
but I have over 200 pages in 13 days.

1:08:02.291 --> 1:08:03.958
I never thought it possible.

1:08:05.083 --> 1:08:06.708
To support devices.

1:08:06.791 --> 1:08:08.500
Support devices.

1:08:14.416 --> 1:08:15.708
It's good, Mank.

1:08:15.791 --> 1:08:17.125
Damn good.

1:08:17.208 --> 1:08:20.208
I have it on highest authority
it's the best thing he's done.

1:08:20.958 --> 1:08:22.916
As a moving picture, it's more than good.

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:28.375
I'm at a loss to even express
how wealth and influence can crush a man.

1:08:28.458 --> 1:08:31.583
It's Lear. The dark night of the soul.

1:08:31.666 --> 1:08:33.500
And I was completely mistaken.

1:08:33.583 --> 1:08:37.083
The shifting point of view
is revolutionary.

1:08:37.166 --> 1:08:40.000
I never thought
one could care so much about a sled.

1:08:40.583 --> 1:08:42.250
It's kind of you to say.

1:08:42.333 --> 1:08:43.166
But.

1:08:43.750 --> 1:08:45.625
"But," again.

1:08:45.708 --> 1:08:47.708
It's 327 pages.

1:08:47.791 --> 1:08:49.625
An embarrassment of riches.

1:08:49.708 --> 1:08:53.333
When the Dog-Faced Boy gets here,
there will be branches to prune.

1:08:53.416 --> 1:08:57.750
"A far too long screenplay for the ages."
John Houseman.

1:08:59.250 --> 1:09:03.500
I built him a watertight narrative
and a suggested destination.

1:09:04.125 --> 1:09:06.291
Where he takes it, that's his job.

1:09:13.041 --> 1:09:16.000
I was looking to get you paid.

1:09:16.875 --> 1:09:19.125
I don't know if you were aware or not.

1:09:21.041 --> 1:09:24.250
You signed your rights to the Mercury.
You agreed not to take screen credit.

1:09:24.333 --> 1:09:27.416
-I needed the work.
-You may want to reconsider.

1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:33.458
All I currently want is a real shower,
a cocktail, and my Sara to wake up to.

1:09:33.541 --> 1:09:34.666
Are you certain?

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:37.166
It worked out.

1:09:42.791 --> 1:09:46.541
Mank, if I may be so bold, why Hearst?

1:09:47.750 --> 1:09:50.333
Lord knows,
outside his own blonde Betty Boop,

1:09:50.416 --> 1:09:52.791
you were always
his favorite dinner partner.

1:09:55.083 --> 1:10:01.666
John, are you familiar with the parable
of the organ grinder's monkey?

1:10:43.166 --> 1:10:47.208
Today, our roving reporter is visiting
Mrs. Elsie Hammontree of Azusa.

1:10:47.291 --> 1:10:51.083
Elsie, would you mind telling the folks
at home why you're voting Republican?

1:10:51.166 --> 1:10:52.916
Young man, I'm a widow,

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.875
and this little home may not be much,
but it's all I have left.

1:10:56.958 --> 1:10:59.875
-And I intend to protect it.
-Poor old woman.

1:10:59.958 --> 1:11:03.250
Would you mind telling the folks
why you're voting for Frank Merriam?

1:11:03.333 --> 1:11:06.916
Well, I'm voting for Frank Merriam
because I wanna keep our way of life.

1:11:07.416 --> 1:11:08.791
I know that voice.

1:11:10.041 --> 1:11:11.083
It is familiar.

1:11:11.583 --> 1:11:13.333
That's Maude Anderson.

1:11:14.625 --> 1:11:16.833
It is. Aunt Bertha from Lonely Trails.

1:11:16.916 --> 1:11:20.958
Well, she's no widow.
And she's absurdly rich.

1:11:21.458 --> 1:11:25.250
That "poor old woman" has got
enough oil wells south of El Segundo

1:11:25.333 --> 1:11:26.916
to buy us both, Schnutz.

1:11:29.166 --> 1:11:32.125
I'd know that whiskey gargle anywhere.

1:11:47.125 --> 1:11:49.166
Hey, Mank.

1:11:50.916 --> 1:11:53.250
Looks like you found work, C.C.

1:11:53.750 --> 1:11:57.000
Don't nose it around,
but yeah, just in the nick.

1:11:58.666 --> 1:12:00.458
-Who's hiring?
-MGM.

1:12:01.166 --> 1:12:04.958
They cleaned out the Washington
and Culver gates like a dose of Ex-Lax.

1:12:05.041 --> 1:12:07.083
Grady gets a speaking part.

1:12:07.166 --> 1:12:09.375
They told us to come dressed as we are.

1:12:09.458 --> 1:12:13.708
I don't know who thought of it,
but it keeps a lot of us off the streets.

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:16.916
Don't forget to vote.

1:12:19.125 --> 1:12:20.166
Okay.

1:12:20.250 --> 1:12:22.208
He's confused with Sinclair Lewis.

1:12:22.291 --> 1:12:26.166
So many hicks think he wrote Elmer Gantry,
it's cost him the Dust Bowl vote.

1:12:26.250 --> 1:12:27.375
I'm in.

1:12:27.958 --> 1:12:29.958
Poor sap.
Not only has he got no money,

1:12:30.041 --> 1:12:32.333
he's an idealist, for Christ's sakes.

1:12:32.416 --> 1:12:34.958
Talk about political handicaps. I'm out.

1:12:35.041 --> 1:12:37.000
Times says he'll lose by 200,000.

1:12:37.083 --> 1:12:39.458
It's amazing
what $10 million against him bought.

1:12:39.541 --> 1:12:40.375
Raise.

1:12:40.458 --> 1:12:43.000
That's what he gets
for surrounding himself with amateurs.

1:12:43.083 --> 1:12:47.625
They not only charge admission to rallies,
they pass a plate once suckers are inside.

1:12:47.708 --> 1:12:48.666
Call.

1:12:48.750 --> 1:12:51.791
He's the most famous schlub
after FDR, Hitler, and Mussolini.

1:12:51.875 --> 1:12:53.416
That ought to count for something.

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:55.583
-Hiya, Shell, sit in.
-The bookies know.

1:12:55.666 --> 1:12:57.791
Soon as Maude's
radio spots started running,

1:12:57.875 --> 1:13:01.291
the odds went from 7-5 for to 2-1 against.

1:13:01.375 --> 1:13:04.875
Could you effete political snobs
please shut up and play?

1:13:04.958 --> 1:13:06.083
Mank, can I talk to you?

1:13:06.166 --> 1:13:07.833
I'll see you guys

1:13:07.916 --> 1:13:09.958
and bump you two big ones.

1:13:10.041 --> 1:13:11.125
It's important.

1:13:11.208 --> 1:13:13.333
What? Now, Shelly?

1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:16.666
It better be.

1:13:17.666 --> 1:13:20.291
That's the first good hand
I've had all day.

1:13:22.333 --> 1:13:24.875
I didn't know he knew
what a good hand looked like.

1:13:24.958 --> 1:13:25.916
I'm out.

1:13:26.416 --> 1:13:29.083
Mind telling us who you favor
in this fall's election?

1:13:29.166 --> 1:13:33.375
-I'm going to vote for Frank Merriam.
-Mind telling us your principal reason?

1:13:33.458 --> 1:13:36.041
Well, I want Merriam because I want a job.

1:13:36.541 --> 1:13:39.583
If you drive all the capital
out of the country, who'll pay us?

1:13:39.666 --> 1:13:42.333
So, you think Merriam
would be safest for all of us?

1:13:42.416 --> 1:13:43.458
Absolutely.

1:13:44.041 --> 1:13:46.833
It's no time
to trade horses in the middle of a stream.

1:13:46.916 --> 1:13:49.083
Are you going to vote
in the coming election?

1:13:49.166 --> 1:13:51.500
-I most certainly am.
-Who would you vote for?

1:13:51.583 --> 1:13:55.708
-I'm sure I'm gonna vote for Mr. Sinclair.
-You must have a good reason to.

1:13:55.791 --> 1:13:58.916
Well, Mr. Sinclair got something new.
He got that EPIC Plan.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.375
And I feel as though it's time
we should try something new out again.

1:14:02.458 --> 1:14:04.000
I need prosperity.

1:14:04.500 --> 1:14:06.791
Well, first of all, I'm an American,

1:14:06.875 --> 1:14:10.041
and I believe
that Mr. Merriam will support

1:14:10.125 --> 1:14:13.583
all the foundations and principles

1:14:13.666 --> 1:14:16.416
that this country has stood for
in the past 150 years.

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000
I have a job now, and I wanna keep it.

1:14:19.083 --> 1:14:21.916
My wife and I love California,
and we'd like to stay.

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.666
But in case we should have to leave,

1:14:24.750 --> 1:14:26.958
I'd like to have
at least a couple dollars.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:28.916
Cut.

1:14:34.750 --> 1:14:38.291
Mrs. Hammontree, mind telling the folks
why you're voting for Frank Merriam?

1:14:38.375 --> 1:14:41.375
Well, I'm voting for Frank Merriam
because I wanna keep our way of life.

1:14:41.458 --> 1:14:44.083
You don't believe a Democrat
would protect your way of life?

1:14:45.083 --> 1:14:46.416
Why, that man's a socialist.

1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:50.333
I don't know much about politics,
but I do know this.

1:14:50.833 --> 1:14:52.916
If Upton Sinclair wins this election,

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.083
private ownership in California
won't amount to a hill of beans.

1:14:56.666 --> 1:14:59.583
Well, we need
complete rejuvenation of our system,

1:15:00.500 --> 1:15:02.500
so I vote for Comrade Upton.

1:15:02.583 --> 1:15:05.666
His system work in Russia, why not here?

1:15:05.750 --> 1:15:07.250
Cut. Do it again.

1:15:08.875 --> 1:15:09.958
What'd you think?

1:15:10.916 --> 1:15:14.000
Truthfully, Shelly,
if the performances were any better,

1:15:14.083 --> 1:15:15.500
you'd be ashamed of yourself.

1:15:15.583 --> 1:15:17.250
Only half of 'em were actors.

1:15:17.750 --> 1:15:21.375
It's got that raw newsreel feel,
hasn't it?

1:15:21.875 --> 1:15:26.500
-But it isn't news, and it isn't real.
-I wasn't looking to have a debate.

1:15:26.583 --> 1:15:29.000
-When did they cook this up?
-At a meeting in production.

1:15:29.083 --> 1:15:31.500
They were passing around a pamphlet
Sinclair wrote

1:15:31.583 --> 1:15:33.375
called "Ending Poverty in California."

1:15:33.458 --> 1:15:36.166
"America's unemployed
will invade the Golden State."

1:15:36.250 --> 1:15:39.583
-Mayer was giddy to use it against him.
-Yeah, I bet he was.

1:15:41.291 --> 1:15:44.375
It's enough to persuade me
that a writer is more of a menace

1:15:44.458 --> 1:15:46.875
to an unsuspecting public
than a party hack.

1:15:46.958 --> 1:15:48.000
Manky--

1:15:49.083 --> 1:15:49.916
You okay?

1:15:51.125 --> 1:15:52.125
Just nerves.

1:15:53.791 --> 1:15:56.916
If it's bothering you, Shelly,
why get involved?

1:15:58.125 --> 1:15:59.708
They gave me a chance to direct.

1:16:03.791 --> 1:16:06.833
You don't think anyone old enough
to vote's gonna buy this shit?

1:16:07.333 --> 1:16:10.458
Only the ones who believe
King Kong is ten stories tall

1:16:10.541 --> 1:16:13.083
or Mary Pickford a virgin at 40.

1:16:25.458 --> 1:16:27.125
Thanks, Cedric. These are fine.

1:16:32.541 --> 1:16:35.333
I've just watched our Sinclair films.

1:16:37.166 --> 1:16:38.041
What did you think?

1:16:38.125 --> 1:16:41.625
Well, with all due respect to Shelly,
King Kong, they ain't.

1:16:43.291 --> 1:16:45.000
Though I do think footage

1:16:45.083 --> 1:16:48.666
of invading hobos
has a certain xenophobic power

1:16:48.750 --> 1:16:52.875
when front-paged in the Times
and backed by those tacky billboards.

1:16:52.958 --> 1:16:57.000
Shelly got a chance to direct,
and I canceled your $12,000 gambling debt.

1:16:57.083 --> 1:16:59.625
I'd call that a fair return
on a one-minute lecture

1:16:59.708 --> 1:17:01.333
for uninspired studio chieftains.

1:17:02.750 --> 1:17:05.250
Your director's been stricken
with a bout of conscience.

1:17:05.333 --> 1:17:07.291
I'm sure he'll tell me himself.

1:17:09.666 --> 1:17:12.333
Don't do this, Irving.

1:17:14.083 --> 1:17:17.333
When I was just a boy, passing out
socialist leaflets in the Bronx,

1:17:17.416 --> 1:17:20.791
a couple Tammany goons came
to show me the error of my ways.

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:22.750
One of them crushed my testicles

1:17:22.833 --> 1:17:26.333
until I volunteered to distribute
my wares into the East River.

1:17:26.916 --> 1:17:30.458
That's politics. I didn't invent it,
I don't apologize for it.

1:17:35.125 --> 1:17:36.958
Mayer's not paying for this.

1:17:38.083 --> 1:17:39.625
He never pays for anything.

1:17:43.166 --> 1:17:44.250
Willie?

1:17:46.750 --> 1:17:50.750
-Marion might be interested.
-Well, you're gonna have to hurry.

1:17:50.833 --> 1:17:53.541
Mayer's over there now,
giving her the company kiss-off.

1:17:54.708 --> 1:17:55.875
Haven't you heard?

1:17:57.541 --> 1:17:59.958
She's taking her playpen
to Warner Bros.

1:18:00.541 --> 1:18:01.416
Permanently.

1:18:02.250 --> 1:18:05.541
-Warner's?
-I wouldn't let her do Marie Antoinette.

1:18:06.041 --> 1:18:09.833
Goldwyn's right for once.
"A comedienne in that role is to laugh."

1:18:10.916 --> 1:18:13.916
Besides, her pictures
haven't made a dime in a decade.

1:18:14.625 --> 1:18:16.375
Congratulations, Irving.

1:18:17.750 --> 1:18:19.333
I know what I am, Mank.

1:18:19.958 --> 1:18:22.166
When I come to work,
I don't consider it slumming.

1:18:22.250 --> 1:18:24.666
I don't use humor
to keep myself above the fray.

1:18:24.750 --> 1:18:26.833
I go to the mat for what I believe in.

1:18:26.916 --> 1:18:29.791
I haven't the time to do otherwise.

1:18:31.041 --> 1:18:32.083
But you, sir,

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.958
how formidable people like you might be
if they actually gave at the office.

1:18:38.416 --> 1:18:39.583
Close the door.

1:19:24.958 --> 1:19:27.375
Mank! Are you okay?

1:19:27.958 --> 1:19:30.791
No, that almost killed me. Where's Willie?

1:19:31.416 --> 1:19:32.541
Cairo, I think.

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:35.791
-Can you phone him?
-I don't phone him, he phones me.

1:19:35.875 --> 1:19:36.958
When's he due back?

1:19:37.041 --> 1:19:39.916
After November 6th.
I'm joining him in Europe next week.

1:19:42.125 --> 1:19:45.333
Marion, I need a favor.
It's just a little joke on Willie.

1:19:45.416 --> 1:19:46.666
Sure, Mank, anything.

1:19:46.750 --> 1:19:49.750
I want you to go back and tell Mayer

1:19:49.833 --> 1:19:53.458
Willie wants
the phony Sinclair films pulled.

1:19:55.625 --> 1:19:57.458
Which phony Sinclair films?

1:19:57.541 --> 1:20:00.791
There isn't time to explain.
I just need you to tell him that.

1:20:01.541 --> 1:20:03.250
I couldn't, not even as a joke.

1:20:03.333 --> 1:20:06.166
-Why not?
-You know I don't lie.

1:20:06.916 --> 1:20:09.458
And that's why he'd believe you.

1:20:09.541 --> 1:20:12.625
Marion, please,
you're not in convent school anymore.

1:20:16.083 --> 1:20:20.166
-I'm sorry. I know it's silly, but--
-But what? Why not?

1:20:20.250 --> 1:20:24.500
-Promise you won't laugh.
-I promise I won't laugh.

1:20:25.166 --> 1:20:27.416
-My exit.
-What?

1:20:28.833 --> 1:20:30.875
I already made my exit.

1:21:01.166 --> 1:21:02.916
-Manky!
-Whatie?

1:21:03.416 --> 1:21:05.208
It's an ash-throated flycatcher!

1:21:05.291 --> 1:21:07.833
Congratulations. Best kind.

1:21:08.875 --> 1:21:11.708
What can I say? She's my aunt.

1:21:11.791 --> 1:21:14.708
It's not about her, it's about him.

1:21:15.833 --> 1:21:19.375
-Or rather, it's him, but it's not her.
-It isn't?

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:23.000
The lonely showgirl, trapped in a castle,
doing jigsaw puzzles.

1:21:23.083 --> 1:21:27.166
It's more her as people
who don't know her imagine her to be.

1:21:27.250 --> 1:21:28.375
I see.

1:21:29.625 --> 1:21:32.625
It's her as they imagine her,
but it's him as you knew him.

1:21:32.708 --> 1:21:35.125
-Damn it, Charlie.
-You asked me out here.

1:21:35.208 --> 1:21:37.458
I was honored to come
and read your latest.

1:21:37.958 --> 1:21:41.041
-Is this a test?
-A test? Of what?

1:21:41.833 --> 1:21:44.708
-Friendship? Loyalty?
-Come now.

1:21:44.791 --> 1:21:46.958
Or just your way
of avoiding responsibility?

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:49.000
What do you mean?

1:21:49.083 --> 1:21:52.791
Are you hoping I might absolve you
of such a personal betrayal?

1:21:54.375 --> 1:21:55.500
I won't give you that.

1:21:59.083 --> 1:22:01.000
Are you going to say anything?

1:22:06.083 --> 1:22:09.500
-I have to think about it.
-Why?

1:22:09.583 --> 1:22:12.208
I haven't made up my mind
how she might react.

1:22:12.291 --> 1:22:14.041
What does instinct tell you?

1:22:14.125 --> 1:22:15.666
That it's mighty strong medicine

1:22:15.750 --> 1:22:18.250
for a lifetime
of starry-eyed self-absorption.

1:22:18.333 --> 1:22:21.458
It's one of those cures
that could be worse than the disease.

1:22:21.541 --> 1:22:23.958
But you, of all people,
should know about that.

1:22:31.333 --> 1:22:32.750
He took the script?

1:22:35.625 --> 1:22:36.583
Will he show it to her?

1:22:39.916 --> 1:22:40.958
I don't know.

1:22:42.291 --> 1:22:43.458
Do you want him to?

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:47.000
I don't know.

1:23:21.583 --> 1:23:23.958
Sinclair is yesterday's fish-wrap.

1:23:24.916 --> 1:23:26.458
Never stood a chance.

1:23:27.625 --> 1:23:28.625
Make up your mind.

1:23:28.708 --> 1:23:31.625
Are we home licking our wounds
or here making the best of it?

1:23:32.666 --> 1:23:34.416
We're making the best of it.

1:23:37.166 --> 1:23:39.583
-Good evening. Name?
-Mankiewicz.

1:23:39.666 --> 1:23:40.750
Sorry, what was that?

1:23:40.833 --> 1:23:44.125
M-A-N-K-I-E-W-I-C, and outta nowhere, a Z.

1:23:44.208 --> 1:23:47.291
-Table 14.
-Ends of the earth. A clean exit.

1:23:47.375 --> 1:23:49.166
Mankiewicz, Herman.

1:23:50.791 --> 1:23:53.708
Terribly sorry. Table one. Right this way.

1:23:55.875 --> 1:23:59.208
If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything at all.

1:24:11.291 --> 1:24:12.833
-Table one.
-Sara!

1:24:12.916 --> 1:24:15.583
Good grief. Look who's here.
How about that?

1:24:15.666 --> 1:24:18.500
-Sara.
-What a loyal friend you are.

1:24:18.583 --> 1:24:21.416
-I never thought we'd see Mank.
-I'm surprised.

1:24:21.500 --> 1:24:23.500
I would've imagined you in pajamas by now.

1:24:23.583 --> 1:24:26.375
Mank, turns out we have
the same dentist on Camden.

1:24:26.458 --> 1:24:29.458
Sara, we have to plan
a day of shopping and catch up.

1:24:29.541 --> 1:24:32.250
Herman, I met your brother.
He's a chip off the old block.

1:24:32.333 --> 1:24:33.416
Quite handsome.

1:24:37.333 --> 1:24:38.833
Please, sit.

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.041
I can't tell you how much it means.
I'm touched you'd come.

1:24:44.125 --> 1:24:45.250
Thank you for this.

1:24:48.458 --> 1:24:49.666
Why do I love you?

1:24:57.041 --> 1:24:58.541
What's everyone else having?

1:25:39.041 --> 1:25:42.458
-What a great night. Great result.
-I'll drink to that.

1:25:42.541 --> 1:25:45.958
You see, if you just give people
what they need to know

1:25:46.041 --> 1:25:49.958
in an emotional way,
you can expect they'll do the right thing.

1:25:50.041 --> 1:25:51.666
I think what you mean,

1:25:51.750 --> 1:25:54.125
"If you keep telling people
something untrue,

1:25:54.208 --> 1:25:56.750
loud and long enough,
they're apt to believe it."

1:25:56.833 --> 1:25:58.083
That's not what he was saying.

1:25:58.166 --> 1:26:01.000
What's going on here?
Are we quoting Goebbels?

1:26:01.083 --> 1:26:03.833
-I'd like to debate that with L.B.
-I'd like to see that.

1:26:03.916 --> 1:26:05.583
Mank, have another.

1:26:05.666 --> 1:26:08.250
It's early. Every vote counts.

1:26:08.333 --> 1:26:11.250
Maybe the informed
of California are late leaving work.

1:26:11.750 --> 1:26:14.125
The last I heard, Irving,
it's still a democracy.

1:26:14.208 --> 1:26:16.291
-Of the people.
-By the people.

1:26:16.375 --> 1:26:18.291
What are you two talking about?

1:26:18.375 --> 1:26:20.875
I tell you what, how about…

1:26:22.166 --> 1:26:23.166
double or nothin'?

1:26:23.250 --> 1:26:25.000
-What's he saying?
-Herman.

1:26:26.458 --> 1:26:28.375
You really will bet on anything.

1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:31.750
Keep your money. I'm happy enough

1:26:31.833 --> 1:26:34.625
just to nail that utopian
son of a bitch to the wall.

1:26:34.708 --> 1:26:37.458
I told you, your obligation
was canceled out of gratitude.

1:26:38.250 --> 1:26:39.458
Wait a minute. What?

1:26:40.416 --> 1:26:42.125
He wants to wager double or nothin'

1:26:42.208 --> 1:26:44.208
on a debt he doesn't even owe us?

1:26:44.291 --> 1:26:46.791
-Mank.
-It's a matter of principle, L.B.

1:26:46.875 --> 1:26:48.166
You wouldn't understand.

1:26:49.875 --> 1:26:54.125
I understand plenty. I'll take that bet.

1:26:55.500 --> 1:26:58.125
Okay, Mank, you're on.
Twenty-four grand or nothing.

1:27:02.875 --> 1:27:04.083
Excuse me.

1:27:05.333 --> 1:27:06.875
I'm going to throw up.

1:28:18.791 --> 1:28:19.833
I needed some air.

1:28:36.291 --> 1:28:38.208
Why do you love me?

1:28:52.041 --> 1:28:54.000
Excuse me, my friends.

1:28:55.875 --> 1:29:00.166
The final, incomplete count
for tonight is…

1:29:01.958 --> 1:29:05.333
Upton Sinclair, the lousy Bolshevik…

1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:09.625
728,653.

1:29:10.666 --> 1:29:11.791
Frank Merriam…

1:29:13.166 --> 1:29:15.541
the good Republican,

1:29:15.625 --> 1:29:19.208
948,814.

1:29:19.291 --> 1:29:21.875
My friends!

1:29:21.958 --> 1:29:25.583
Everybody get up and sing with me!

1:29:25.666 --> 1:29:28.750
Sing with me! Everybody, up and sing!

1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:34.791
It was a team effort. Thanks.

1:29:46.125 --> 1:29:48.833
Mr. Mankiewicz,
I'm so sorry to bother you,

1:29:48.916 --> 1:29:51.916
but there's a telephone call for you.
Right back this way.

1:29:57.083 --> 1:29:59.375
-Hello.
-Mank, it's Shelly.

1:29:59.458 --> 1:30:00.541
It's Shelly.

1:30:00.625 --> 1:30:03.750
-He lost, Mank.
-Yeah, it's been a bad night.

1:30:05.416 --> 1:30:06.250
It's my fault.

1:30:06.333 --> 1:30:10.416
-Easy, fella, you only voted once.
-He was just on the radio.

1:30:10.916 --> 1:30:15.416
He said the phony newsreels
cost him the election.

1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:17.208
That shows how naive he is.

1:30:17.291 --> 1:30:20.208
FDR cost him the election
by staying on the sidelines.

1:30:20.291 --> 1:30:21.291
Sleep it off.

1:30:21.958 --> 1:30:22.916
I'm not at home.

1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:24.916
Where are you?
Let me call you a cab.

1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:28.041
Never mind.
I'll take the Pasadena Freeway.

1:30:28.125 --> 1:30:30.541
Nobody'd be on it election night.

1:30:31.333 --> 1:30:32.166
Hello?

1:30:32.666 --> 1:30:33.500
Hello?

1:30:36.541 --> 1:30:40.041
-How may I direct your call?
-Normandie, 4761.

1:30:40.750 --> 1:30:42.166
He's shit-faced.

1:30:43.375 --> 1:30:44.416
Shell, is that you?

1:30:44.500 --> 1:30:46.458
It's Herman Mankiewicz.

1:30:46.541 --> 1:30:49.458
-Where is he?
-I don't know. I'm so worried.

1:30:49.541 --> 1:30:53.458
He left here very upset,
and he's got a pistol with him.

1:30:53.541 --> 1:30:56.000
Don't worry, Fay. I'll find him.

1:30:56.083 --> 1:30:57.833
-Eve.
-What?

1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:01.708
-I'm Eve. Fay was his first.
-I'll find him.

1:31:05.833 --> 1:31:10.250
Is Houseman coming back?
I never thought I'd miss him.

1:31:11.291 --> 1:31:13.958
He and the wunderkind
are cutting the first draft.

1:31:14.041 --> 1:31:16.916
A form of creative vivisection.

1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:20.041
Vital organs are exposed,
nothing is learned,

1:31:20.125 --> 1:31:22.000
the patient dies on the table.

1:31:27.291 --> 1:31:29.250
What have we here?

1:31:31.583 --> 1:31:36.791
Why, it's a puffed-up,
sharp-tailed, red-ruffled magpie.

1:31:36.875 --> 1:31:38.125
A whatie?

1:31:58.666 --> 1:32:03.375
-How do you like the Mojave?
-God's answer for drunks and reprobates.

1:32:03.458 --> 1:32:05.458
Perfect place to dry out.

1:32:05.541 --> 1:32:08.875
-How's that working?
-It didn't take. Cheers.

1:32:09.458 --> 1:32:10.583
L'chaim.

1:32:17.291 --> 1:32:18.458
Why are you doing this?

1:32:19.083 --> 1:32:21.750
-Posterity.
-Posterity, my ass.

1:32:21.833 --> 1:32:24.125
-From the original Latin.
-Don't patronize me.

1:32:24.208 --> 1:32:28.000
-My Latin grades were better than yours.
-Bibamus, moriendum est.

1:32:32.625 --> 1:32:34.708
I read your little script.

1:32:36.375 --> 1:32:37.708
News travels fast.

1:32:37.791 --> 1:32:39.250
Even without the title page,

1:32:39.333 --> 1:32:42.166
you don't need
to be Philip Marlowe to know who wrote it.

1:32:43.125 --> 1:32:44.125
Have at it.

1:32:44.791 --> 1:32:45.833
It's very…

1:32:48.208 --> 1:32:49.041
complicated.

1:32:49.125 --> 1:32:50.833
Well, thanks for coming out.

1:32:51.833 --> 1:32:53.708
Herman, this is me.

1:32:54.333 --> 1:32:56.875
You pick a fight with Willie,
you are finished.

1:32:57.458 --> 1:32:59.458
Mayer can't save you. Nobody can.

1:32:59.541 --> 1:33:01.833
Especially the boy genius from New York.

1:33:01.916 --> 1:33:05.875
-You're far too political, Joe.
-Self-preservation is not politics.

1:33:06.458 --> 1:33:07.791
Him, I get.

1:33:08.541 --> 1:33:12.291
-But what did Marion do to deserve this?
-It's not her!

1:33:13.958 --> 1:33:17.500
You know better than anyone,
not all characters are headliners.

1:33:17.583 --> 1:33:18.875
Some are secondary.

1:33:18.958 --> 1:33:22.875
Well, that's why I'm here.
On behalf of the secondary characters.

1:33:25.083 --> 1:33:27.333
I thought you'd wanna know there's a rumor

1:33:27.416 --> 1:33:30.708
you're out to get Hearst because
they dropped you from L.B.'s payroll,

1:33:30.791 --> 1:33:32.541
that they didn't want you around.

1:33:32.625 --> 1:33:34.875
Don't believe everything
you hear at Schwab's.

1:33:34.958 --> 1:33:37.333
Hey, you made yourself court jester.

1:33:40.375 --> 1:33:42.083
Someone had to say it.

1:33:51.333 --> 1:33:55.875
People are speculating Rosebud
is W.R.'s pet name for Marion's genitalia.

1:33:56.375 --> 1:33:59.750
-I know you'd never stoop to that.
-Only because I hadn't heard.

1:34:15.166 --> 1:34:18.208
Charlie tells me
you're up for Thalberg's old job.

1:34:18.291 --> 1:34:20.875
-Not anymore.
-Did I bollix that?

1:34:20.958 --> 1:34:24.250
Don't flatter yourself, Herman.
I did it all alone.

1:34:24.333 --> 1:34:25.416
Now, there's a first.

1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:29.208
I exposed myself,
not entirely metaphorically, in court.

1:34:29.291 --> 1:34:30.166
Do tell.

1:34:30.791 --> 1:34:34.458
Somebody was bitching about Mervyn LeRoy
running over budget on Wizard of Oz.

1:34:34.541 --> 1:34:37.416
-Goddamn movie again.
-I said, "Le Roy s'amuse."

1:34:37.500 --> 1:34:39.416
I was then forced to spend 20 minutes

1:34:39.500 --> 1:34:41.166
having to explain that "Le Roy"

1:34:41.250 --> 1:34:43.958
is "le roi" in French
and means "the king."

1:34:44.041 --> 1:34:45.958
Or to be specific, François I

1:34:46.041 --> 1:34:50.583
and his royal habit of s'amus-ing himself
by diddling all the ladies of his court.

1:34:55.416 --> 1:34:58.875
You know, Pop was right.
You should've been a professor.

1:34:59.583 --> 1:35:02.125
Nobody knew
what the fuck I was talking about.

1:35:02.750 --> 1:35:06.125
They say I was passed over
because I'm not a team player.

1:35:06.791 --> 1:35:07.750
But I know better.

1:35:08.250 --> 1:35:10.625
It was the goddamn French pun
that did me in.

1:35:17.708 --> 1:35:19.208
I'm washed up, Joe.

1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:23.916
Have been for years.

1:35:29.625 --> 1:35:31.750
It's the best thing you've ever written.

1:35:48.958 --> 1:35:50.458
A rare bird, that.

1:35:52.833 --> 1:35:54.000
A Mankiewicz.

1:36:17.833 --> 1:36:20.958
-You can't do it that way.
-Do what?

1:36:21.041 --> 1:36:23.291
Kill yourself. I've tried.

1:36:23.375 --> 1:36:24.500
It takes years.

1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.333
I was tired of doing
inserts and pick-up shots.

1:36:28.416 --> 1:36:31.125
You're not the first person
to trade integrity

1:36:31.208 --> 1:36:33.041
for a chance in the big chair.

1:36:34.125 --> 1:36:36.875
Thalberg said this was your idea.

1:36:36.958 --> 1:36:40.208
Sometimes my asides
are too clever by half.

1:36:43.750 --> 1:36:45.708
Go home to Fay.

1:36:45.791 --> 1:36:47.958
-Eve.
-Eve. Sorry.

1:36:50.458 --> 1:36:52.041
Look at what we did.

1:36:52.125 --> 1:36:54.250
We can't un-ring this bell.

1:36:54.333 --> 1:36:56.208
We have to be vigilant.

1:36:56.291 --> 1:36:57.791
In regards to?

1:36:57.875 --> 1:36:59.750
People sitting in the dark,

1:36:59.833 --> 1:37:02.625
willingly checking their disbelief
at the door.

1:37:03.125 --> 1:37:05.583
We have a huge responsibility.

1:37:07.125 --> 1:37:08.125
I got it.

1:37:09.291 --> 1:37:10.250
Got what?

1:37:11.750 --> 1:37:13.083
Parkinson's.

1:37:18.958 --> 1:37:21.000
No, Shelly.

1:37:27.250 --> 1:37:28.500
I'm so sorry.

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:31.000
First, you get the tremors,

1:37:32.375 --> 1:37:34.583
and your muscles begin to fail.

1:37:35.916 --> 1:37:38.291
Pretty soon, you can't get out of a chair.

1:37:39.500 --> 1:37:42.625
Then smiling, speaking,

1:37:42.708 --> 1:37:44.166
everything goes.

1:37:45.375 --> 1:37:47.750
And it keeps going till…

1:37:48.500 --> 1:37:50.333
You could always produce.

1:37:57.416 --> 1:37:59.208
Give me the gun, Shelly.

1:38:23.208 --> 1:38:24.041
Take 'em, Mank.

1:38:26.666 --> 1:38:29.458
Go on home. I'll be fine.

1:39:15.125 --> 1:39:16.125
Is he with you?

1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:18.750
He wouldn't come.

1:39:20.458 --> 1:39:21.833
Tell me you got the gun.

1:39:29.125 --> 1:39:30.083
Oh, my God!

1:39:31.875 --> 1:39:34.458
-What?
-He had a whole box.

1:39:49.333 --> 1:39:50.541
Mank.

1:39:52.166 --> 1:39:53.583
You have another visitor.

1:39:55.250 --> 1:39:56.250
What?

1:40:17.458 --> 1:40:18.583
Drink it fast.

1:40:19.250 --> 1:40:21.208
In this heat, it'll flash to sugar.

1:40:28.958 --> 1:40:30.791
Why the wine and dine, Marion?

1:40:31.625 --> 1:40:33.083
Good cop, bad cop?

1:40:33.166 --> 1:40:36.083
-How do you mean, Mank?
-First Joe, now you.

1:40:38.041 --> 1:40:40.291
Can't you just tell me
what's on your mind?

1:40:42.166 --> 1:40:45.000
Well, I read the script.

1:40:45.083 --> 1:40:46.291
Who hasn't?

1:40:46.375 --> 1:40:48.791
It's very grand, Mank, in its own way,

1:40:48.875 --> 1:40:50.250
and very much you.

1:40:51.166 --> 1:40:53.083
I would've loved to play me ten years ago.

1:40:53.166 --> 1:40:55.208
It was never meant to be you.

1:40:55.291 --> 1:40:57.875
For myself, I don't care, Mank.
Really, I don't.

1:40:58.750 --> 1:41:02.833
But I beg you,
don't kick Pops when he's down.

1:41:02.916 --> 1:41:04.750
Willie, down?

1:41:07.833 --> 1:41:09.625
I haven't told a soul this,

1:41:10.333 --> 1:41:14.083
but I had to loan him a million dollars
just to save San Simeon.

1:41:14.166 --> 1:41:15.791
You hocked your jewels?

1:41:16.375 --> 1:41:20.083
Of course not, just some real estate.
He bought me most of it anyway.

1:41:20.625 --> 1:41:22.125
Willie sent you.

1:41:23.083 --> 1:41:23.958
Didn't have to.

1:41:27.458 --> 1:41:28.958
That surprises you?

1:41:29.458 --> 1:41:31.375
You're the most observant man I know.

1:41:31.458 --> 1:41:34.583
-Then you deserve better.
-That's very sweet.

1:41:37.208 --> 1:41:38.458
I always wanted better.

1:41:39.416 --> 1:41:40.541
Mama Rose, too.

1:41:40.625 --> 1:41:43.333
She made sure
her daughters learned to sing and dance.

1:41:44.041 --> 1:41:46.291
We were never gonna end up in Brooklyn.

1:41:46.958 --> 1:41:50.500
I was only 16
when I was cast in Stop! Look! Listen!

1:41:50.583 --> 1:41:52.333
That's some title.

1:41:53.125 --> 1:41:55.833
Willie came to the show.
Same seat, every night.

1:41:55.916 --> 1:42:00.625
And all the other girls said to watch out.
He was too old for me and too interested.

1:42:00.708 --> 1:42:03.458
Come now, he wasn't your only admirer.

1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:08.041
The thing you got so right
in your script…

1:42:08.875 --> 1:42:11.416
was how lonely he'd been as a boy.

1:42:14.458 --> 1:42:18.333
When my own mother heard
he was one of the richest men in America,

1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:20.791
she said, "Kick a little higher."

1:42:23.333 --> 1:42:26.625
He has always been so kind to me.

1:42:28.458 --> 1:42:30.000
I love the old guy, Mank.

1:42:31.750 --> 1:42:33.333
Maybe I didn't always,

1:42:33.416 --> 1:42:36.000
back when he was my social security.

1:42:36.666 --> 1:42:39.333
But now,
there are things about us together…

1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:41.625
that no one could possibly…

1:42:45.541 --> 1:42:47.291
Am I persuading you at all?

1:42:50.791 --> 1:42:53.583
I hope, if this gets made,

1:42:55.416 --> 1:42:56.750
you'll forgive me.

1:42:57.833 --> 1:42:58.916
And I hope,

1:42:59.833 --> 1:43:00.916
if it doesn't,

1:43:02.541 --> 1:43:03.666
you'll forgive me.

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:15.666
He was a modest man.

1:43:16.166 --> 1:43:18.000
His name never appeared on the marquee

1:43:18.083 --> 1:43:22.250
with the great stars, great producers,
great directors who worked alongside him.

1:43:23.416 --> 1:43:26.291
But he loved moving pictures
more than he loved anything.

1:43:26.375 --> 1:43:30.000
And he left his impeccable taste,
his incredible attention to detail

1:43:30.083 --> 1:43:32.416
on every frame he touched.

1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:36.583
It is not for us to say
why he was taken from us so unexpectedly.

1:43:36.666 --> 1:43:38.791
Behind, he leaves his memory.

1:43:39.291 --> 1:43:42.291
The memory of a great man, a talented man,

1:43:42.375 --> 1:43:44.583
a man of unblemished integrity.

1:43:45.416 --> 1:43:47.750
Irving G. Thalberg.

1:44:01.541 --> 1:44:02.500
Mank.

1:44:03.875 --> 1:44:07.666
I haven't seen you since,
what was it, Jack Gilbert's funeral?

1:44:07.750 --> 1:44:10.541
Well, I haven't seen you
since Shelly Metcalf's.

1:44:11.375 --> 1:44:12.625
Has it been that long?

1:44:14.416 --> 1:44:17.041
-How you been, Mank?
-Between pictures.

1:44:18.125 --> 1:44:21.208
-I thought you were still at MGM.
-I am.

1:44:23.666 --> 1:44:27.000
Well, look. Come see me at International.
Let's work something out.

1:44:27.083 --> 1:44:28.500
I did come to see you.

1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.041
You gave me the same invitation
after Shelly's funeral.

1:44:32.541 --> 1:44:35.708
I couldn't get past
your secretary's secretary.

1:44:36.916 --> 1:44:37.958
Is that right?

1:44:40.750 --> 1:44:42.083
Good to see you, Mank.

1:45:27.458 --> 1:45:29.375
-Hello.
-Mank?

1:45:30.250 --> 1:45:31.416
One moment, please.

1:45:38.416 --> 1:45:39.333
Mank.

1:45:39.833 --> 1:45:40.750
Mank!

1:45:41.500 --> 1:45:42.375
It's Orson.

1:45:43.208 --> 1:45:44.083
It's Orson.

1:45:53.125 --> 1:45:54.416
-Hello.
-Mank.

1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:57.166
I've just finished
your first draft, and I must say,

1:45:57.250 --> 1:45:58.958
I'm pleased and impressed.

1:45:59.041 --> 1:46:02.458
-Are you? Good news.
-It'll need work, of course.

1:46:02.541 --> 1:46:05.291
But there are no problems
that can't be solved together.

1:46:05.375 --> 1:46:07.000
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.

1:46:07.083 --> 1:46:09.000
Houseman's bringing my notes.
Think about 'em.

1:46:09.083 --> 1:46:11.208
Meantime, I'll run everything
through my typewriter.

1:46:11.291 --> 1:46:12.666
Everything will thank you.

1:46:12.750 --> 1:46:15.083
You're in touch with your Hollywood crowd?

1:46:15.958 --> 1:46:17.166
Good old Houseman.

1:46:17.250 --> 1:46:20.291
Perhaps you've heard.
None of the theater chains will touch us.

1:46:20.375 --> 1:46:23.500
It looks like RKO will have to sue
for restraint of trade.

1:46:23.583 --> 1:46:25.083
They'll countersue, of course.

1:46:25.166 --> 1:46:27.250
If you own any part
of that lovely home of yours,

1:46:27.333 --> 1:46:30.541
it might be a good idea
to put it in Poor Sara's name.

1:46:31.791 --> 1:46:36.041
-You still there, Mank?
-Yes. Where else would I be?

1:46:36.125 --> 1:46:37.541
I've saved the best for last.

1:46:37.625 --> 1:46:40.166
Guess who phoned
with an offer to buy out RKO's investment

1:46:40.250 --> 1:46:41.875
and shelve the picture permanently.

1:46:41.958 --> 1:46:44.500
-Not Hearst?
-Mank, I'm surprised.

1:46:44.583 --> 1:46:47.750
Would Othello snoop
on Desdemona when he has Iago?

1:46:48.541 --> 1:46:51.958
Mayer. What did RKO say?

1:46:52.041 --> 1:46:55.041
No dice, but they're on their uppers.
Whether they--

1:46:55.125 --> 1:46:57.958
-You'd better drive up.
-I plan to, as soon as I'm done--

1:46:58.041 --> 1:46:59.916
Today, if possible.

1:47:00.416 --> 1:47:02.791
Dear Jove,
did I say something I shouldn't have?

1:47:02.875 --> 1:47:05.000
I hope you haven't lost your nerve.

1:47:05.083 --> 1:47:07.250
Nerve's about all I've got left.

1:47:14.875 --> 1:47:18.000
What a year you've had, Louis.
How have you weathered it?

1:47:18.083 --> 1:47:23.291
Despite everything, the MGM ship,
I'm happy to say, is full steam ahead.

1:47:23.375 --> 1:47:28.833
We're on track with this recent slate
for our most successful year ever.

1:47:28.916 --> 1:47:30.125
Well, that's great news.

1:47:30.750 --> 1:47:32.625
Would you like to go and lay down?

1:47:32.708 --> 1:47:34.750
I think I'd rather stay upright.

1:47:34.833 --> 1:47:39.166
-Perhaps we can find you a costume.
-Well, why would I need a cost--

1:47:42.250 --> 1:47:45.583
Hello, everyone. Better late than never.

1:47:45.666 --> 1:47:47.208
Mank! Where's Sara?

1:47:47.291 --> 1:47:49.958
Caring for clan Mankiewicz.

1:47:50.041 --> 1:47:54.958
-And what train did you take?
-Glendale. I missed my stop.

1:47:55.041 --> 1:47:57.416
Got a taxi from Morro Bay.

1:47:57.500 --> 1:47:58.375
I'm confused.

1:47:58.458 --> 1:48:01.708
I thought the invitation
called for circus attire,

1:48:01.791 --> 1:48:03.500
not flea circus.

1:48:03.583 --> 1:48:07.500
I was cornered by a man
who sold vacuum cleaners.

1:48:07.583 --> 1:48:11.500
A show of hands,
who knows what a vacuum cleaner is?

1:48:11.583 --> 1:48:14.208
Martin, would you set a place
for Mr. Mankiewicz,

1:48:14.291 --> 1:48:16.541
somewhere where he might get some air?

1:48:19.041 --> 1:48:20.791
Would you follow me this way, sir?

1:48:21.416 --> 1:48:23.083
And offer him some coffee.

1:48:23.166 --> 1:48:26.125
Yeah. Mr. Monkeywitz
could use some coffee.

1:48:32.916 --> 1:48:35.625
And how's Marie Antoinette
coming together?

1:48:36.458 --> 1:48:39.166
Previews have been a struggle
for general audiences.

1:48:39.250 --> 1:48:41.875
We made some trims, but I should've known.

1:48:42.541 --> 1:48:45.500
Versailles, all those costumes and wigs.

1:48:45.583 --> 1:48:46.958
You can't tell those stories

1:48:47.041 --> 1:48:49.333
without overhauling them
for a modern audience.

1:48:49.416 --> 1:48:51.458
How's the performance
of your leading lady?

1:48:51.541 --> 1:48:53.166
The picture depends upon her.

1:48:53.250 --> 1:48:56.291
Norma put her heart and soul into it.

1:48:56.375 --> 1:48:58.958
I should've insisted she take some time.

1:48:59.041 --> 1:49:02.833
-It's a lot to deal with a loss like that.
-Marion would've made it her own.

1:49:02.916 --> 1:49:05.416
Marion would have been perfection.

1:49:05.958 --> 1:49:08.958
-Marion Antoinette.
-But it was Irving's picture.

1:49:09.041 --> 1:49:10.291
Marionette.

1:49:11.708 --> 1:49:14.333
I'm not interested
in educating our customers.

1:49:15.041 --> 1:49:17.541
You want to send a message?
Call Western Union.

1:49:19.458 --> 1:49:20.833
Literary pictures.

1:49:20.916 --> 1:49:22.416
"Let them get cake."

1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.333
Who needs to see that?

1:49:28.583 --> 1:49:29.875
Joanna, come along now.

1:49:29.958 --> 1:49:32.083
I'll show you those horses
we talked about.

1:49:40.250 --> 1:49:41.416
She's very pretty.

1:49:42.125 --> 1:49:45.916
Also, very bright,
bullheaded, and British.

1:49:47.833 --> 1:49:50.208
Are you here to try your luck,
too, Schnutz?

1:49:50.708 --> 1:49:54.125
-At what?
-Changing my mind.

1:49:55.291 --> 1:49:57.625
I never had much success
with that, Herman.

1:49:58.125 --> 1:49:59.750
You'll do what you need to.

1:49:59.833 --> 1:50:02.708
Charlie's been here,
Joe's been, Marion's been.

1:50:02.791 --> 1:50:06.000
For one reason or another,
all of them want me to walk away.

1:50:06.625 --> 1:50:08.375
You care to hear what I've decided?

1:50:09.541 --> 1:50:10.416
Not really.

1:50:11.833 --> 1:50:14.166
After 20 years of connubial bliss,

1:50:14.250 --> 1:50:17.208
blind loyalty
can get a little suffocating.

1:50:17.291 --> 1:50:18.125
Okay.

1:50:19.458 --> 1:50:20.416
Here goes.

1:50:21.125 --> 1:50:23.041
God knows I've rehearsed it enough.

1:50:23.625 --> 1:50:26.541
I've raised your kids kosher
and all but by myself.

1:50:26.625 --> 1:50:28.666
I've put up with your suicidal drinking,

1:50:28.750 --> 1:50:31.875
your compulsive gambling,
your silly platonic affairs.

1:50:31.958 --> 1:50:33.458
You owe me, Herman.

1:50:35.291 --> 1:50:36.791
Joe says he can't promise,

1:50:36.875 --> 1:50:40.416
but he thinks if you make nice with Mayer,
you can have your old job back.

1:50:40.500 --> 1:50:43.708
Is that what you want me to say?
I know what your answer'll be,

1:50:43.791 --> 1:50:47.791
so don't ask me to give you
Poor Sara's seal of approval.

1:50:48.666 --> 1:50:51.375
Why do you put up with me, Schnutz?

1:50:51.458 --> 1:50:54.583
My movie-star looks
or my diplomat's charm?

1:50:55.208 --> 1:50:58.291
I suppose
because being married to you, Herman,

1:50:58.375 --> 1:50:59.291
I'm never bored.

1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:01.458
Exhausted, yes.

1:51:01.541 --> 1:51:03.125
Exasperated, usually.

1:51:03.208 --> 1:51:05.083
But having devoted so much,

1:51:05.583 --> 1:51:08.041
I have to stick around
to see how it turns out.

1:51:12.416 --> 1:51:14.125
And whatever you decide…

1:51:16.291 --> 1:51:19.833
please be mindful of those
who care about you most.

1:51:24.041 --> 1:51:25.291
I'm going riding.

1:51:25.875 --> 1:51:28.083
Haven't seen a horse's face in years.

1:51:30.791 --> 1:51:32.416
And one last thing, Herman.

1:51:33.708 --> 1:51:36.625
I don't want nobody
calling me Poor Sara no more.

1:51:50.166 --> 1:51:53.083
I've got a great idea
for a picture, Louis.

1:51:53.583 --> 1:51:57.500
A picture I just know you're gonna love.

1:51:58.625 --> 1:52:02.958
It's a modern-day version of Quixote.

1:52:06.833 --> 1:52:10.625
Now, I know none of you read,
but you know what it's about.

1:52:10.708 --> 1:52:13.041
A deluded old nobleman

1:52:13.125 --> 1:52:15.291
who tilts at windmills.

1:52:16.791 --> 1:52:19.625
So how might we update this story?

1:52:19.708 --> 1:52:21.833
-Do you want me to get someone?
-No.

1:52:21.916 --> 1:52:24.291
How about we make our Quixote…

1:52:25.958 --> 1:52:27.250
a newspaperman?

1:52:28.125 --> 1:52:31.250
Who else could make a living
tilting at windmills?

1:52:31.333 --> 1:52:32.500
But that's not enough.

1:52:32.583 --> 1:52:33.625
No, sir.

1:52:33.708 --> 1:52:36.125
No, he wants more than readership.

1:52:36.208 --> 1:52:40.708
He wants more than adulation.
He wants love.

1:52:42.125 --> 1:52:44.500
So, he runs for public office,

1:52:44.583 --> 1:52:47.041
and because he's notably rich, he wins.

1:52:48.208 --> 1:52:49.916
No, wait a minute.

1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:51.791
Notably rich and powerful

1:52:51.875 --> 1:52:53.250
can't win over an audience

1:52:53.333 --> 1:52:57.791
unless notably rich and powerful sees
the error of his ways in the final reel.

1:52:58.500 --> 1:53:00.375
Notably rich and powerful

1:53:00.458 --> 1:53:05.708
and making no goddamn excuses
for it is only admirable in real life.

1:53:05.791 --> 1:53:07.166
Isn't that right, Louis?

1:53:10.750 --> 1:53:12.208
So what do we do?

1:53:14.458 --> 1:53:15.916
Anybody?

1:53:18.333 --> 1:53:20.833
We give him ideals.

1:53:20.916 --> 1:53:23.541
Ideals that any dirt-poor,

1:53:23.625 --> 1:53:26.916
depression-weary audience
can identify with.

1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.750
Our Quixote is against crooked trusts.

1:53:29.833 --> 1:53:33.625
He's for the eight-hour workday,
fair income tax, better schools.

1:53:33.708 --> 1:53:37.541
Why, he's even
for government ownership of railroads.

1:53:38.500 --> 1:53:40.250
You know what we call those people?

1:53:40.333 --> 1:53:41.625
-Communists?
-Anarchists?

1:53:41.708 --> 1:53:43.291
No, our Quixote,

1:53:43.375 --> 1:53:46.083
he's a two-fisted muckraker.

1:53:46.166 --> 1:53:50.083
In fact,
someone predicts that he will one day

1:53:50.166 --> 1:53:53.833
win the presidency
and bring about, get this…

1:53:58.708 --> 1:54:01.458
a socialist revolution.

1:54:01.541 --> 1:54:04.416
-What a bunch of bullshit!
-Is it?

1:54:05.541 --> 1:54:06.416
Tell him, Willie.

1:54:07.958 --> 1:54:08.958
Tell him.

1:54:10.208 --> 1:54:15.041
Upton Sinclair used exactly those words

1:54:15.125 --> 1:54:18.041
to describe
a young William Randolph Hearst.

1:54:18.125 --> 1:54:21.000
-You miserable bastard!
-How do you do?

1:54:23.916 --> 1:54:27.041
Our Quixote, he hungers, he thirsts,

1:54:27.125 --> 1:54:29.750
he lusts for the voters to love him.

1:54:30.333 --> 1:54:32.500
Love him enough to make him president.

1:54:32.583 --> 1:54:34.958
But they won't, and they don't.

1:54:35.041 --> 1:54:37.333
How do you suppose that could happen?

1:54:37.416 --> 1:54:39.291
Could it be because, in their hearts,

1:54:39.375 --> 1:54:43.083
they know
that he values power over people?

1:54:44.083 --> 1:54:46.041
Disillusioned in Congress,

1:54:46.125 --> 1:54:50.666
he authors not one single piece
of legislation in two terms.

1:54:50.750 --> 1:54:53.708
Can you believe that?
That'll take some writing.

1:54:54.875 --> 1:54:57.208
Placed in nomination for president,

1:54:57.291 --> 1:55:00.625
but it's too radical
for the boys in the back.

1:55:00.708 --> 1:55:02.916
His bid goes nowhere,

1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:04.791
but we're doing something.

1:55:05.291 --> 1:55:07.625
We're building sympathy.

1:55:08.625 --> 1:55:12.208
Rejected, he flees to lotus land,

1:55:12.291 --> 1:55:15.000
where his faithful troll, Sancho,

1:55:15.083 --> 1:55:17.916
has prepared a mythical kingdom.

1:55:20.166 --> 1:55:21.666
Wait a minute.

1:55:23.250 --> 1:55:25.250
I forgot the love interest.

1:55:25.958 --> 1:55:26.916
Her name…

1:55:27.958 --> 1:55:29.375
Dulcinea.

1:55:29.458 --> 1:55:32.958
Funny, adventurous, smarter than she acts.

1:55:33.041 --> 1:55:36.041
She's a showgirl,

1:55:36.708 --> 1:55:38.291
beneath his social stratum,

1:55:38.375 --> 1:55:39.333
but that's okay,

1:55:39.833 --> 1:55:43.000
because true love on the big screens,

1:55:43.083 --> 1:55:45.333
we all know, is blind.

1:55:46.416 --> 1:55:47.458
And she…

1:55:48.875 --> 1:55:50.541
Yeah, she loves him, too.

1:55:52.250 --> 1:55:56.166
So he takes her away
to his mythical kingdom.

1:55:56.250 --> 1:55:57.708
Can I get a bicarb?

1:55:58.791 --> 1:56:02.583
Now, along comes nemesis.

1:56:02.666 --> 1:56:05.416
That's Greek for any guy in a black hat.

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.208
Nemesis runs for governor,

1:56:08.291 --> 1:56:11.375
and he's a shoo-in to win.

1:56:11.458 --> 1:56:12.458
Why?

1:56:13.208 --> 1:56:17.833
Because he's exactly
what our Don used to be.

1:56:17.916 --> 1:56:19.458
An idealist,

1:56:19.541 --> 1:56:20.666
you get it?

1:56:21.333 --> 1:56:22.500
And not only that,

1:56:23.083 --> 1:56:26.750
nemesis is the same guy who once predicted

1:56:26.833 --> 1:56:31.833
our Quixote would one day
preside over a socialist revolution.

1:56:33.083 --> 1:56:37.833
Our Quixote looks
into the mirror of his youth

1:56:37.916 --> 1:56:41.333
and decides to break this glass,

1:56:41.416 --> 1:56:45.041
a maddening reminder of who he once was.

1:56:45.125 --> 1:56:48.708
Assisted by his faithful Sancho

1:56:48.791 --> 1:56:53.708
and armed
with all the black magic at his command,

1:56:53.791 --> 1:56:55.916
he does just this.

1:56:56.416 --> 1:56:58.750
Destroying, in the process,

1:56:58.833 --> 1:57:00.250
not one man…

1:57:01.500 --> 1:57:02.708
but two.

1:57:05.458 --> 1:57:07.041
Well, what do you think, Louis?

1:57:08.458 --> 1:57:09.916
You think it'll play?

1:57:22.541 --> 1:57:24.333
Don't worry, folks.

1:57:25.541 --> 1:57:28.125
The white wine came up with the fish.

1:57:30.541 --> 1:57:34.250
Who the fuck
do you think you are, Mankiewicz?

1:57:35.666 --> 1:57:37.916
You're nothin' but a court jester.

1:57:38.833 --> 1:57:41.041
And let me let you in on a little secret.

1:57:41.125 --> 1:57:44.458
Do you have any idea
who pays half your salary?

1:57:44.541 --> 1:57:46.791
He pays half your fucking salary.

1:57:46.875 --> 1:57:48.666
Him, you fucking ingrate.

1:57:49.333 --> 1:57:51.000
You didn't know that, did ya?

1:57:51.083 --> 1:57:52.166
You wanna know why?

1:57:52.666 --> 1:57:54.541
Because he likes the way you talk.

1:57:54.625 --> 1:57:56.125
Not the way you write,

1:57:56.208 --> 1:57:57.875
the way you talk.

1:57:58.583 --> 1:58:00.625
Don't that chap your ass?

1:58:05.416 --> 1:58:06.375
Stay.

1:58:22.833 --> 1:58:25.333
-Please, follow me.
-It's very quaint.

1:58:33.166 --> 1:58:35.000
Rise and shine, hombre.

1:58:35.958 --> 1:58:37.875
Shoot-out at the O.K. Corral.

1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:42.958
Before we buckle down,
you have something to get off your chest?

1:58:43.041 --> 1:58:45.041
As a matter of fact, I do.

1:58:45.125 --> 1:58:47.083
Frankly, I think what I said upset you.

1:58:47.166 --> 1:58:50.291
I know your health's not what it might be,
and that comes first.

1:58:50.375 --> 1:58:53.416
-Really?
-This studio fuss, this lawsuit.

1:58:53.500 --> 1:58:55.458
God knows what pressure's yet to come.

1:58:55.541 --> 1:58:58.250
At your age,
you'd be justified in wanting out.

1:58:58.333 --> 1:59:00.500
I'm 43, but that's very understanding.

1:59:00.583 --> 1:59:02.500
Mayer's buyout was rejected,

1:59:02.583 --> 1:59:05.166
so the fat's only starting
to hit the fire.

1:59:05.791 --> 1:59:09.208
Now, I talked to RKO, and I'll tell you
what they're ready to do.

1:59:09.291 --> 1:59:12.208
In recognition of the outstanding work
you've done so far,

1:59:12.291 --> 1:59:14.291
they're prepared
to relieve you of the rewrite

1:59:14.375 --> 1:59:16.041
and still honor your full pay…

1:59:16.791 --> 1:59:19.416
plus $10,000.

1:59:20.208 --> 1:59:21.041
How's that?

1:59:22.875 --> 1:59:24.458
That's more than generous.

1:59:25.875 --> 1:59:27.875
But I don't intend to walk.

1:59:29.875 --> 1:59:30.833
All right.

1:59:33.250 --> 1:59:34.958
What's bothering you, then?

1:59:35.041 --> 1:59:37.666
You're not going to like this, Orson.

1:59:42.250 --> 1:59:43.541
I want credit.

1:59:45.625 --> 1:59:46.750
Come again?

1:59:47.791 --> 1:59:50.000
It's the best thing I've ever written.

1:59:50.875 --> 1:59:53.250
Jack, get me some Cuban cigars.

1:59:53.333 --> 1:59:55.375
-In Victorville?
-Do what you can, Jack.

1:59:55.458 --> 1:59:59.125
Stay, Houseman.
You'll miss the third act complicator.

1:59:59.208 --> 2:00:01.166
Get going, Jack. Muy pronto.

2:00:01.958 --> 2:00:04.166
I believe that means right away.

2:00:21.291 --> 2:00:23.000
Mank.

2:00:24.541 --> 2:00:28.416
What I said was more in sorrow
than in anger, Willie.

2:00:31.541 --> 2:00:36.083
Are you familiar with the parable
of the organ grinder's monkey?

2:00:36.166 --> 2:00:40.125
Now, the organ grinder's monkey
is tiny in stature,

2:00:40.208 --> 2:00:42.083
and having been taken from the wild,

2:00:42.166 --> 2:00:46.833
he's naturally overwhelmed
by the enormous world around him.

2:00:47.833 --> 2:00:49.000
But every morning,

2:00:49.083 --> 2:00:51.791
a sweet elderly woman dresses him

2:00:51.875 --> 2:00:53.875
in a fine suit of clothes.

2:00:54.541 --> 2:00:59.041
She fits him with a red velvet vest
adorned with pearl buttons

2:00:59.125 --> 2:01:02.750
and a handsome red fez with a silk tassel.

2:01:02.833 --> 2:01:05.583
She slips on brocade shoes

2:01:05.666 --> 2:01:07.500
that curl at the toe.

2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:13.416
And he's paired with a fine gilt music box
on an exquisite gold chain

2:01:13.500 --> 2:01:16.708
fastened to his neck and his neck alone.

2:01:17.375 --> 2:01:22.000
Whenever he ventures
into the city to perform, he thinks,

2:01:22.083 --> 2:01:24.625
"What a powerful fellow I must be."

2:01:24.708 --> 2:01:28.583
"Look how patiently everyone waits
just to watch me dance."

2:01:28.666 --> 2:01:29.500
Willie--

2:01:29.583 --> 2:01:32.000
"And wherever I go," he thinks,

2:01:32.083 --> 2:01:34.458
"this music box must follow,

2:01:34.541 --> 2:01:38.416
and with it,
this poor downtrodden man."

2:01:38.500 --> 2:01:41.208
"And if I chose not to dance,

2:01:41.291 --> 2:01:44.333
this sorry street peddler would starve,

2:01:44.416 --> 2:01:47.708
and every time I do decide to dance,

2:01:47.791 --> 2:01:48.833
every time…

2:01:53.708 --> 2:01:55.250
he must play."

2:01:57.083 --> 2:01:58.958
"Whether he wishes to or not."

2:02:00.541 --> 2:02:02.666
You've had a bit too much to drink,
Herman.

2:02:02.750 --> 2:02:05.625
I'll get Raymond
to drive you to the station.

2:02:06.916 --> 2:02:07.791
Goodbye.

2:02:16.416 --> 2:02:17.916
Put aside gratitude, Mank.

2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.166
That you've done your best work
was no accident.

2:02:20.250 --> 2:02:23.500
I removed any distraction,
eliminated every excuse,

2:02:23.583 --> 2:02:26.083
your family, your cronies, liquor.

2:02:26.166 --> 2:02:27.750
I gave you a second chance.

2:02:27.833 --> 2:02:30.250
And for that, I cannot thank you enough.

2:02:30.333 --> 2:02:34.958
But with credit for a risky undertaking
must go the weight of real responsibility.

2:02:35.041 --> 2:02:37.166
Given your health,
I wonder if you're up to it.

2:02:37.250 --> 2:02:39.791
And frankly, I wonder too,
but we'll find out.

2:02:39.875 --> 2:02:42.375
You may never work
in this town again, Mank!

2:02:42.875 --> 2:02:44.000
Orson, please…

2:02:44.083 --> 2:02:46.541
Then you force me to remind you!

2:02:46.625 --> 2:02:50.125
We have a contract
that you understood and agreed to.

2:02:50.208 --> 2:02:53.833
If you fight this, it will go
to what your new guild calls arbitration,

2:02:53.916 --> 2:02:57.291
and you, my friend,
will lose script, money,

2:02:57.375 --> 2:02:59.875
and, assuming such a thing
still exists in Hollywood,

2:02:59.958 --> 2:03:01.958
the respect of those who honor their word.

2:03:02.041 --> 2:03:04.708
How can I put this nicely?

2:03:05.833 --> 2:03:08.000
I may be a loose cannon,

2:03:08.083 --> 2:03:11.041
but you, my friend, are an outsider.

2:03:11.125 --> 2:03:14.208
They're exasperated by me,
and I've earned it,

2:03:14.291 --> 2:03:17.458
but you, a self-anointed savior-hyphenate,

2:03:17.541 --> 2:03:20.416
they're just waiting to loathe you.

2:03:20.500 --> 2:03:23.166
Remind me never again
to work with a washed-up alcoholic!

2:03:23.250 --> 2:03:26.083
Duly noted. Nelson Algren, please copy.

2:03:26.166 --> 2:03:28.791
All right!
No doubt you'll get your credit.

2:03:28.875 --> 2:03:31.666
But ask yourself,
"Who's producing this picture?"

2:03:31.750 --> 2:03:34.333
"Directing it? Starring in it?"

2:03:37.208 --> 2:03:39.375
That's what we need
when Susan leaves Kane.

2:03:40.125 --> 2:03:42.041
An act of purging violence.

2:03:44.666 --> 2:03:45.625
Maybe.

2:03:58.708 --> 2:04:01.458
Mank, where are you?

2:04:02.458 --> 2:04:03.958
Mank, come quick!

2:04:09.208 --> 2:04:10.291
He's alive!

2:04:11.250 --> 2:04:12.583
Ian's alive!

2:04:13.083 --> 2:04:15.791
-He fetched up on the Orkneys!
-The what?

2:04:15.875 --> 2:04:17.875
The Orkney Islands, you idiot.

2:04:18.791 --> 2:04:20.375
Mank, are you ever serious?

2:04:21.541 --> 2:04:23.166
Only about something funny.

2:04:49.416 --> 2:04:52.125
And the winner
of the best original screenplay is…

2:04:53.750 --> 2:04:55.416
Herman J. Mankiewicz…

2:04:57.750 --> 2:05:01.000
and Orson Welles for Citizen Kane.

2:05:02.875 --> 2:05:06.625
This is the first nomination and first win
for Mr. Mankiewicz and Mr. Welles.

2:05:06.708 --> 2:05:08.458
Neither were able to attend tonight.

2:05:08.541 --> 2:05:11.250
Accepting for both is the president
of RKO Radio Pictures,

2:05:11.333 --> 2:05:12.750
Mr. George Schaefer.

2:05:14.541 --> 2:05:18.375
-Excuse me, Mr. Welles.
-Good morning, gentlemen.

2:05:18.458 --> 2:05:21.083
Morning, Mr. Welles.
You missed a big night.

2:05:21.166 --> 2:05:24.041
Well, I was unable to attend
the Academy Awards

2:05:24.125 --> 2:05:28.208
because I'm here in Rio
making a marvelous motion picture.

2:05:28.291 --> 2:05:31.708
Kane was nominated
in nine categories, including best actor.

2:05:31.791 --> 2:05:34.666
Aren't you disappointed
that it only won one Oscar?

2:05:35.458 --> 2:05:39.541
Well, that, my good man, is Hollywood.

2:05:40.583 --> 2:05:43.541
Anything you'd like to say
to your coauthor, Mr. Mankiewicz?

2:05:43.625 --> 2:05:45.166
I do have a brief message.

2:05:45.250 --> 2:05:46.875
You may tell him from me…

2:05:48.541 --> 2:05:51.583
"Mank, you can kiss my half!"

2:06:00.250 --> 2:06:05.041
You ask me what
my acceptance speech might have been.

2:06:06.791 --> 2:06:07.791
Well, here goes.

2:06:08.875 --> 2:06:14.166
I am very happy to accept this award

2:06:14.250 --> 2:06:17.625
in the manner in which
the screenplay was written,

2:06:18.125 --> 2:06:22.541
which is to say,
in the absence of Orson Welles.

2:06:25.291 --> 2:06:26.416
How's that?

2:06:26.916 --> 2:06:28.333
How come he shares credit?

2:06:29.750 --> 2:06:35.166
Well, that, my friend,
is the magic of the movies.

2:06:35.916 --> 2:06:38.875
Hold up the Oscar, Mank. Big smile.
