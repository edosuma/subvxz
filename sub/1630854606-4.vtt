WEBVTT

00:16.433 --> 00:19.144
<i>Bonjour,</i> it's Emily, in Paris.

00:19.227 --> 00:22.230
<i>Today is Day 1 of fun-employment.</i>

00:22.313 --> 00:25.442
<i>I want to know</i>
<i>where and what you guys want to see.</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:30.572
I am your eyes and ears
to this beautiful city.

00:30.780 --> 00:31.740
Wow, oh!

00:31.823 --> 00:34.325
A lot of you are joining already.
Let's see here.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.286
<i>"I want to see Monet's</i> Water Lilies."

00:36.369 --> 00:37.704
<i>So do I.</i>

00:37.787 --> 00:40.832
<i>"Can you try Angelina's hot chocolate?"</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:43.793
I do not need an excuse for that,
so yes, I will be.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.213
<i>And "Go back to… Go back to America."</i>

00:47.297 --> 00:49.424
<i>No, I think we're done here. For now.</i>

00:49.507 --> 00:52.552
<i>All right, but my DMs are open</i>
<i>and I will see you there.</i>

00:53.678 --> 00:54.721
<i>Merci!</i>

01:19.162 --> 01:20.038
Oop!

01:25.085 --> 01:27.629
We are very excited to present to you

01:27.712 --> 01:30.924
our concept of
the Edgard and Cooper pet filter.

01:32.634 --> 01:37.305
We have noticed that pet owners
often look like their animals.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.850
We don't know how it happens,
but it happens.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.771
My childhood poodle. Jeanne d'Arc.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.481
It's uncanny.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.565
Terrifying.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.775
[Julien] For this campaign,

01:48.858 --> 01:53.029
we let people become their pets
using the Edgard and Cooper avatar filter.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.323
[barking]

01:56.116 --> 01:57.700
Hello, I'm Jeanne d'Arc.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.410
Nice to meet you.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.747
We think that
the personal element of the filter

02:02.831 --> 02:04.624
will increase social engagement.

02:05.291 --> 02:09.045
Yes, and you'll find that this is
a global online cost-effective campaign.

02:09.879 --> 02:11.089
I must tell you,

02:11.172 --> 02:13.800
I wasn't sure this company
would be the right fit for us.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.053
But I'm impressed.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.140
[chuckles softly]

02:20.723 --> 02:23.268
Agence Grateau aims to please.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.729
[in French] Well done.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.064
That went well.

02:28.148 --> 02:28.982
Good, right?

02:29.065 --> 02:30.108
Frankly I was worried.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.569
Since I wasn't involved in the creative.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.945
If we're being honest…

02:35.530 --> 02:38.074
Uh… Well, in fact… We…

02:38.158 --> 02:42.370
We can't take full credit for that idea.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.998
Emily slipped us her pitch

02:45.081 --> 02:48.001
when she was courting the client
for Savoir.

02:48.084 --> 02:48.918
Excuse me?

02:49.002 --> 02:49.836
Sylvie…

02:50.712 --> 02:52.547
You can't be that surprised.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.674
The proposal had
Emily Cooper written all over it.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.677
Come on.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.388
We're simply
finishing something she started.

03:00.471 --> 03:01.598
That's it.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.266
Then finish it. Without her.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.894
You shouldn't be relying on the ideas

03:05.977 --> 03:07.645
of someone who doesn't work here.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.813
I must be dreaming!

03:20.325 --> 03:21.159
These forms came from the labor office.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.619
These are for insurance registration.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.203
Plus the department of taxes.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.080
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

03:34.005 --> 03:36.132
[in English] I'm so thrilled
to have you here.

03:36.215 --> 03:39.510
This gallery has never shown anything
that is not on the canvas.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.222
So, you are a victory for me.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.557
No pressure then.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.894
Not at all.
I only begged to have you here.

03:49.103 --> 03:49.938
Really?

03:50.772 --> 03:52.815
Somehow, I think
you always get what you want.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.110
Oh!

03:56.194 --> 03:57.028
By the way,

03:58.404 --> 04:00.740
this is the invitation for the exhibit

04:00.823 --> 04:03.534
taken from the cover
of Rousseau's <i>Confessions.</i>

04:03.618 --> 04:04.619
Brilliant.

04:05.119 --> 04:06.496
Though he looks kind of lonely.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.540
He does.
But secrets will do that to you, right?

04:10.625 --> 04:14.462
True. But confessing your secrets
can make you feel less alone.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.506
Let me show you.

04:18.549 --> 04:19.592
Have a seat.

04:23.054 --> 04:23.888
Hey.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.181
[clears throat]

04:29.811 --> 04:33.940
Well, if there is anything
you want to confess, this is the place.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.110
I don't have any secrets.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.573
In that case,
I can lend you one of mine, if you like.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.491
[chuckles]

04:51.040 --> 04:52.625
-Oh, excuse me.
-Yeah.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.065
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.444
I am all yours.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.238
No, no worries, I've been there.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.409
Trapped by the corporate grind,
just another cog in the machine.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.246
All right, all right, you've been
unemployed for, what, 72 hours?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.665
I'm just saying,
we talk about work-life balance,

05:32.749 --> 05:34.459
and right now, I'm all about life.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.127
Yesterday I walked 20,000 steps

05:36.210 --> 05:39.547
and I've accomplished so many things
on my unemployment to-do list.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.715
Can I see this list?

05:40.798 --> 05:41.632
Don't judge.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.675
Mmm-hmm.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.429
Okay, so, we've got the Catacombs, nice.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.890
Musée Carnavalet, interesting.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.267
Theodora the Orangutan?

05:51.350 --> 05:52.769
Oh, yeah, she's very famous.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.103
[chuckles]

05:55.354 --> 05:57.690
Cooper, you dirty little minx.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.568
Have S in the middle of the day?

06:01.527 --> 06:03.279
Is that S what I think it is?

06:03.362 --> 06:04.447
Yeah, steak-frites.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.240
But I love steak-frites.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.492
[both laugh]

06:11.704 --> 06:13.164
[phone vibrating]

06:13.247 --> 06:14.582
-You need to get that?
-No.

06:22.006 --> 06:25.009
[in French] I hope you're kidding.
What am I supposed to do now?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.719
Yes, okay. Great, great.

06:27.053 --> 06:31.099
[Emily in English] So, we are confirmed
for the macaron baking class on Thursday,

06:31.182 --> 06:33.017
and you're good for the Segway tour?

06:33.101 --> 06:34.811
I got the early bird deal.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.521
Aren't you tired? I'm so tired.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.149
My ass is sore from climbing the steps
of L'Arc de Triomphe.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.359
So yes on the Segways?

06:41.442 --> 06:45.196
Emily, a jam-packed schedule
is the worst way to be unemployed.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.322
Mmm-mmm.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.241
Hi.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.700
Is everything okay?

06:49.784 --> 06:51.410
My waiter's grandfather died.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.787
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.248
It's the third time
his grandfather died this year.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.376
His girlfriend's posting
that they're on vacation in Corsica.

06:58.876 --> 06:59.877
[both] Oh.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.339
Yeah, so I told him not to bother
coming back, and now I'm short-staffed.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.507
[Emily] Uh…

07:05.466 --> 07:06.592
I'll fill in.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.302
I waited tables in college.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.304
You? No way.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.057
Come on, Chef,
give the woman something to do. Please.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.268
I got Employee of the Month
at The Feedbag.

07:16.018 --> 07:16.978
Twice.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.939
So, put me in, coach.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.816
You don't even understand the menu.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.735
<i>Pardonnez-moi,</i>
but my French has gotten <i>très</i> better.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.362
<i>Dis-lui, Mindy.</i>

07:27.238 --> 07:29.365
-[in English] I mean, it's not worse.
-Mmm.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.492
Yeah, and I mean, I'm already trained.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.286
So, where do you keep your aprons?

07:33.744 --> 07:36.581
-[lively music playing]
-[people chattering indistinctly]

07:36.664 --> 07:37.832
Ooh! [chuckles]

07:38.583 --> 07:39.417
Sorry.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.004
You're welcome.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.842
[in French] I'll have the beef
in pepper sauce, medium rare,

07:47.925 --> 07:50.136
and she would like hers rare.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.638
Slower, please?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.557
I'll have the beef…

07:54.682 --> 07:56.601
in pepper sauce…

07:56.684 --> 07:57.602
medium rare.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.686
And for her…

07:58.769 --> 08:00.480
rare. The same thing.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.981
<i>-Merci.</i>
<i>-Merci.</i>

08:05.943 --> 08:06.861
[in English] Okay.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.030
[women laughing]

08:12.408 --> 08:13.242
<i>Merci.</i>

08:14.702 --> 08:17.872
[in English] Thank you guys so much.
It was so nice to meet you.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.166
Take care. Bring in the kids next time.

08:20.917 --> 08:21.918
Bye.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.420
You are a natural. Who knew?

08:24.921 --> 08:27.632
Too bad we don't work for tips.
Your customers love me.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.175
And I'm not even tired.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.760
My dopamine levels have risen

08:30.843 --> 08:33.387
because I've accomplished many
small tasks over one night.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.182
What you're experiencing
is the post-service high.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.268
It's like a rapid-fire to-do list.
It's exhilarating.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.437
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.648
Hey, what's going on?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.775
And why are you wearing an apron?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.276
Oh, I'm filling in.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.237
Claude took a permanent vacation.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.989
Wow. Okay. But how about your real job?

08:52.073 --> 08:53.324
I quit.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.535
You quit Savoir? Why?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.162
Because staying there
meant moving back to Chicago,

08:58.246 --> 09:00.414
and I just love Paris too much.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.709
We'll see if you feel the same way
after working here for a week.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.586
-[laughs]
-[chuckles politely]

09:15.429 --> 09:17.014
[sighs]

09:30.861 --> 09:34.949
Any chance you can come to Paris
for a couple of days?

09:35.658 --> 09:37.159
Everything okay?

09:37.243 --> 09:40.621
I'm drowning in red tape.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.375
Sexy.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.753
Seriously, I need help.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.880
Be there asap.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.592
[sighs]

09:58.639 --> 09:59.473
[in French] Duck.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.684
[Emily] Asshole.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.852
Duck.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.688
[in English] That's what I said.
What is the difference?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.815
One's a stuffed duck,
the other one's an asshole.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.317
Oh.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.902
-I thought you were taking French classes?
-I am.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.488
If there's expressions
you use at the airport on the menu,

10:14.572 --> 10:15.406
I'm your girl.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.700
You've got to admit, I am getting better.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.743
Actually, you have.

10:18.826 --> 10:22.121
Your memory's astonishing.
Your pronunciation though, weak spot.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.998
Everyone speaks so fast.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.124
You think <i>we</i> speak fast?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.375
[cell phone chimes]

10:26.459 --> 10:29.211
I've got a Segway tour to get to.
I'll practice this later. Toodaloo.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.379
[in French] See you later.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.922
[in English] That's what I said!

10:38.179 --> 10:41.390
[in French] The new exhibit at my gallery
opens tonight. Please come.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.559
I've heard great things.
Thank you, Camille.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.186
Where is Emily?

10:45.269 --> 10:46.812
She's the point person on our account, no?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.314
Our apologies.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.857
Emily doesn't work here anymore.

10:49.940 --> 10:50.775
Really?

10:52.068 --> 10:52.902
What happened?

10:54.111 --> 10:55.363
She returned with her former employer.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.405
Back to Chicago.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.908
Emily's not in Chicago.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.785
[chuckles]

11:00.868 --> 11:02.787
Don't you follow her Instagram?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.121
She goes live almost every day.

11:04.705 --> 11:05.748
Show her. Look.

11:05.831 --> 11:06.666
Look.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.251
[in English] <i>Right behind me here,</i>

11:09.335 --> 11:10.961
<i>we have Notre-Dame.</i>

11:11.045 --> 11:14.048
<i>Or as we Midwesterners like to say,</i>
<i>"Note-er Dame."</i>

11:14.131 --> 11:17.843
♪ <i>She'll be coming round the Notre-Dame</i>
<i>When she comes ♪</i>

11:17.927 --> 11:18.761
<i>♪ When she comes! ♪</i>

11:18.844 --> 11:20.888
[Mindy] <i>Nice. High five, bitch!</i>

11:20.971 --> 11:22.598
<i>-Whoo!</i>
-[laughing]

11:23.432 --> 11:26.477
[in French] You must admit,
never a dull moment with that Emily.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.479
Turn that off, please.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.189
What Emily chooses to do
In her free time is none of our concern.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.274
Let's focus on why we're here.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.278
The next chapter Domaine de Lalisse
at Agence Grateau.

11:37.113 --> 11:37.947
Congratulations.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.244
I was a little thrown
by the news about Emily.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.287
Why is she still in Paris
if she's not working for Sylvie?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.039
She has a life here now.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.374
Friends, a boyfriend.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.333
-A boyfriend?
-Yes.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.292
Oh!

11:50.376 --> 11:51.669
Wonderful!

11:52.169 --> 11:53.879
Then there's no problem anymore
with Gabriel.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.714
You see?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.174
I told you everything will work out.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.300
Don't remind me.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.802
I still don't feel good about what I did.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.097
Making that pact with Emily,
and then breaking it.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.765
What's the problem?

12:04.849 --> 12:07.601
You got the love of your life back.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.855
Why don't we forget all that
and grab a drink before dinner?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.232
There's a wonderful new chef in Paris

12:13.315 --> 12:14.525
I've been hearing about--

12:14.608 --> 12:15.693
Wow!

12:15.776 --> 12:18.696
I have work to do before the opening.
Enjoy dinner without me.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.947
I'll see you at the gallery.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.657
Okay, see you in a bit, darling.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.786
Come on.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.301
[in English]
I'm so glad you texted me.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.553
-I miss you guys so much.
-Really?

12:42.636 --> 12:44.805
It seems like you've been keeping busy.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.183
What? I thought
you got a job as a tour guide.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.184
Ugh!

12:48.267 --> 12:49.393
[in French] Gentlemen, lady.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.311
Have you decided?

12:50.394 --> 12:53.314
We'll have a round of Kir Royales.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.398
Very good.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.234
[in English] I keep busy
to keep from going insane.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.653
I don't do well sitting still.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.657
So, you're open to returning to work then?

13:03.741 --> 13:05.075
Is that an option?

13:05.493 --> 13:08.454
No. Just a question.
You can't get your hopes high.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.957
I mean, the worst thing you can do
is remind Sylvie you exist.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.167
Oh, gee. Thanks.

13:13.876 --> 13:17.963
We have an expression in French.
It's <i>"reculer pour mieux sauter."</i>

13:18.923 --> 13:20.883
Step back to jump better.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.678
Sylvie's like a cat.
You've got to let her come to you.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.597
But what am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

13:26.680 --> 13:27.640
Nothing.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.476
I just told you. I am not good at that.

13:32.102 --> 13:32.937
<i>Et voilà.</i>

13:33.020 --> 13:34.104
<i>-Ah, merci.</i>
-You're welcome.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.398
<i>-Merci.</i>
-Enjoy.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.316
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

13:37.399 --> 13:38.234
<i>Santé.</i>

13:38.317 --> 13:40.069
<i>Santé!</i>

13:40.152 --> 13:41.529
To Emily's unemployment.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.327
This is delicious. What is it?

13:48.410 --> 13:50.037
It's a Kir Royale.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.413
Say it to me.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.457
Kir Royale.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.125
-Perfect.
-Ah.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.504
Kir Royale. It's Crème de Cassis
topped with champagne.

13:59.213 --> 14:03.467
The perfect drink to sip and do nothing
as the Ferris wheel turns.

14:05.302 --> 14:09.390
I wonder how many people
are having sex on it as we speak?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.518
-Excuse me?
-Everyone does it.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.030
[in French] Okay, where is it?

14:26.907 --> 14:28.576
Should be with your bills from 2022…

14:29.660 --> 14:30.953
Here it is! Found it. Finally.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.747
No, that's not it.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.667
There is so much tedious bureaucracy

14:36.750 --> 14:38.168
to owning a company.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.629
Yeah, I could have told you that.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.673
This isn't the best use of my time.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.924
I'm worried
creative is getting the short shrift

14:44.008 --> 14:45.759
because of all the administrative bullshit
I have to deal with now.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.344
[sighs]

14:48.262 --> 14:50.639
-Here.
-Oh, yes.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.851
Welcome to owning your own business.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.686
Oh.

14:55.769 --> 14:56.729
[door opens and closes]

14:58.522 --> 15:00.482
Um… Hi.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.943
<i>-Bonsoir.</i>
<i>-Bonsoir.</i>

15:03.193 --> 15:05.988
[in English] I didn't realize
you were in town, Laurent.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.743
Don't worry.
You'll barely notice I'm here.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.954
Here? You're staying here?

15:14.455 --> 15:17.750
Yes, just for a few days, on the couch.
Don't worry about it.

15:18.709 --> 15:19.543
Charming.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.882
Well, if we're going to
make that gallery opening,

15:24.965 --> 15:26.091
we'd better get going.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.096
God, I lost track of time. <i>Pardon, eh.</i>

15:32.014 --> 15:33.432
I'm going to get dressed.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.561
[Laurent chuckles]

15:49.323 --> 15:50.282
Louise, Gérard.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.825
-[chuckles]
-[exclaims]

15:56.705 --> 16:00.042
[in French] We've heard such
magnificent things about this restaurant.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.544
Apparently the chef is one in a million.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.879
Are you in town for Camille's opening?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.590
Yes, I hear it's amazing.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.384
But we don't want to go
on an empty stomach.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.387
Don't worry about that, Gérard.
I wish I could be there tonight,

16:11.470 --> 16:12.346
but things have been so busy here.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.682
All good? Good evening.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.724
Not bad, hmm?

16:15.808 --> 16:16.767
Someone will be right by

16:16.850 --> 16:18.018
to get you some drinks.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.228
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

16:19.311 --> 16:20.229
Ooh!

16:21.814 --> 16:23.023
It's very crowded.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.192
[gasps]

16:25.567 --> 16:26.568
Monillo.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.946
He really put some money in this place.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.366
[in English] <i>Bonsoir,</i> my Champère fam.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.785
Emily, what are you doing here?

16:34.868 --> 16:36.078
[Emily] I'm just helping out.

16:36.161 --> 16:39.164
Gabriel was short-staffed
and I have all the time in the world.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.584
So you work here?

16:42.668 --> 16:45.170
Well, only temporarily.
For as long as he needs me.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.505
[Louise] I see.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.091
We had a meeting
with your old team this afternoon.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.135
Your absence did not go unnoticed.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.595
Such a shame.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.433
I felt as though
we had only just gotten started.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.684
The feeling was mutual.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.562
If you guys want
to bounce any ideas off of me,

17:01.645 --> 17:03.188
I'm just a phone call away.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.942
I had a drink today
that'd be perfect for your brand.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.736
Kir Royale. Crème de Cassis--

17:08.819 --> 17:11.155
With champagne.
I know what a Kir Royale is.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.992
It's a little fancy for Champère,
don't you think?

17:15.576 --> 17:18.620
No, not Champère. Chamère.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.833
Canned cocktails,
they're all the rage among 18-35s.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.337
Sorry. Duty calls.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.548
Just an idea, mull it over.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.425
And if I know Gabriel,

17:31.508 --> 17:33.761
he's already preparing
your favorite dishes,

17:33.844 --> 17:35.888
so no need to order. Enjoy.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.476
"If I know Gabriel."

17:40.559 --> 17:42.227
[in French] The audacity.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.190
-Damn it.
-What?

17:46.273 --> 17:48.108
Chamère. It's a good idea.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.109
<i>Oui.</i>

17:49.193 --> 17:50.069
She's good.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.779
-Yes.
-She's very good.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.494
[speaking French]

18:07.461 --> 18:10.339
Why didn't you mention Emily
was working at Gabriel's?

18:10.422 --> 18:11.381
I thought it would be more fun this way.

18:11.882 --> 18:12.883
And you're okay with this?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.052
She's just waiting tables.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.637
Sure, that's how it begins.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.348
Close quarters, a stressful environment.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.766
It could lead anywhere.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.267
You need to watch your back,

18:22.351 --> 18:23.894
before that Emily undoes everything
you've worked for.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.313
This, this is my work.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.398
And I'm so proud of you.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.775
But I can't help but notice the two people

18:29.858 --> 18:31.235
that aren't here
are together somewhere else.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.361
I'm just looking out for you, Camille.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.321
I want you to enjoy all this,
your success,

18:34.404 --> 18:35.739
without having to worry
about your relationship.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.283
I know.
But as you said, it's my relationship.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.660
Congratulations, darling.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.918
[speaking indistinctly]

18:48.127 --> 18:51.839
[in English] Sofia, your gallery in Athens
called. It's urgent. So sorry.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.092
Oh, I should take that.
Thank you for coming. Okay.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.761
I have a confession.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.263
You want to take it to the booth?

18:59.346 --> 19:00.597
Your gallery didn't call.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.309
You just looked like
you needed rescuing from that guy.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.563
Thank you.
He was getting a little too friendly.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.648
-And he's definitely not my type.
-Nope.

19:09.731 --> 19:14.862
I'm much more into
smart French women with exquisite taste.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.740
Let's talk more later.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.287
[Louise in French] Sylvie! What joy!

19:23.370 --> 19:25.539
I'm so glad
you could come support our Camille.

19:25.622 --> 19:26.999
My pleasure.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.252
You know, I was surprised
about Emily Cooper.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.629
My apologies. You should've been informed.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.590
I mean, I was surprised to see

19:34.673 --> 19:36.341
she's waitressing at Chez Lavaux.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.468
That's news to me.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.429
She was pitching ideas

19:40.512 --> 19:41.430
that are very interesting.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.431
Even though it's not her job anymore.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.683
I don't understand what she's doing there.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.560
Seems to me that she's dealing with

19:46.643 --> 19:48.687
the consequences of her choices.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.522
[chuckles]

19:50.606 --> 19:52.774
You and I have a lot in common, Sylvie.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.359
We are both businesswomen.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.069
I hate to admit it,

19:56.153 --> 19:58.363
but ego can
often get the best of a person.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.824
Did Emily put you up to this?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.868
What exactly was this "good idea" of hers?

20:02.951 --> 20:05.537
Oh, I'm in no position
to do any favors for that girl.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.581
But, in my opinion,

20:07.664 --> 20:10.125
the most useful people to keep around
are the ones you're threatened by.

20:11.793 --> 20:12.628
Chamère.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.712
Excuse me?

20:13.795 --> 20:14.796
Chamère.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.423
Kir Royale in a bottle.

20:16.506 --> 20:17.883
Emily's idea.

20:17.966 --> 20:18.800
We'll be in touch.

20:23.013 --> 20:23.847
[in English] Here.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.101
Everything's okay?

20:29.269 --> 20:30.103
Yeah.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.397
Fine.

20:33.023 --> 20:33.857
Good.

20:39.738 --> 20:40.572
[in French] Is something wrong?

20:41.990 --> 20:42.824
Honey, are you okay?

20:43.951 --> 20:44.910
No.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.161
Hold on…

20:46.954 --> 20:47.788
Are you all right?

20:47.871 --> 20:48.705
No, it's…

20:48.789 --> 20:49.873
Wait…

20:50.374 --> 20:51.333
Excuse me please, miss?

20:52.751 --> 20:55.420
I need to know exactly what was
in the green beans please?

20:55.504 --> 21:00.968
Yes, this was the green beans
with a sauce of <i>champi-pons.</i>

21:01.051 --> 21:03.262
Mushrooms? She said mushrooms.
She said mushrooms! Mushrooms?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.346
Mushrooms!

21:04.429 --> 21:06.682
I told you my husband is allergic to
mushrooms, are you kidding me?

21:06.765 --> 21:08.976
It's very dangerous, look at him,
he can't breathe, he's turning red.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.936
He's allergic to mushrooms,
it's not complicated to understand!

21:11.019 --> 21:12.354
[in English] What's going on?

21:12.729 --> 21:13.689
[in French] Sir, are you okay?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.275
[in English] I think he's having
an allergy attack.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.318
[in French] Your waitress told us
there were no mushrooms in the dish.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.444
There are mushrooms, he wouldn't
be reacting like this otherwise.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.613
Did you tell them
there were no mushrooms?

21:21.697 --> 21:23.490
No, I thought he said no champagne.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.702
<i>Champignons,</i> not champagne.
<i>Champignons,</i> Emily. It's mushrooms.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.620
That's just confusing. I don't know.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.663
Call 112.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.498
112? What is that like 911?

21:31.581 --> 21:32.624
Give me your phone.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.793
-You said no cell phones at work.
-Oh, Christ.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.628
[in French] She needs to get fired!
She's horrible at her job!

21:40.257 --> 21:41.383
I hope you enjoyed it.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.385
-Very much.
-Thank you, it was wonderful.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.886
-Oh, great.
-Good evening.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.431
<i>Merci. </i>Thanks for coming.

21:48.098 --> 21:48.932
Bye.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.229
[in English] Thank you for tonight.

21:54.896 --> 21:55.981
It was a dream.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.274
I'm happy you're happy.

21:57.941 --> 22:00.569
I'm curious if you had a chance
to make a confession.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.405
I told you. I don't have any secrets.

22:04.865 --> 22:05.699
What about you?

22:06.366 --> 22:08.285
Can the artist be her own subject?

22:09.911 --> 22:11.246
This one's just for you.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.375
[whispering indistinctly]

22:20.714 --> 22:21.548
Good night.

22:55.665 --> 22:56.666
I'm so sorry.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.753
Obviously I missed vegetable day
at French class.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.047
Stop apologizing. He's fine.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.757
[Emily] I'm not supposed to be here.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.551
I'm not cut out to be a waitress,
I'm a marketing executive.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.095
What am I doing with my life?

23:08.178 --> 23:10.305
I thought you wanted
to take some time off?

23:10.388 --> 23:12.724
I'm trying to make the most of all this,

23:12.808 --> 23:16.686
but so far all I've been able to do
is field spam messages from Instagram bots

23:16.770 --> 23:18.647
and nearly kill one of your regulars.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.565
Do you want to know what I think?

23:20.649 --> 23:22.109
[sighs] Please.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.739
I think you're making life into work.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.534
Well, I can't help it.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.578
Slow down. You've been given
the gift of time. Take it.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.205
[in French] Take the time to live.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.624
[in English] Take the time to live?

23:38.125 --> 23:39.251
[in French] Yes.

23:39.334 --> 23:42.170
Your timing kind of sucks,
but your French is improving.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.674
Well, I'm just so scared
of what will happen when I do.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.093
There's only one way to find out.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.219
[sighs]

23:49.302 --> 23:51.721
Emily, you're fired.

23:54.724 --> 23:55.976
Oh!

23:56.059 --> 23:56.893
Thank you.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.480
Get out.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.439
[chuckles]

24:11.241 --> 24:14.369
I walked in on Laurent this morning.
Peeing with the door open.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.537
Ew!

24:15.620 --> 24:17.914
And he probably heard us last night.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.167
That wouldn't be the first time.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.502
That's supposed to make me feel better?

24:23.545 --> 24:24.379
Erik,

24:24.963 --> 24:27.090
he's just here to help me with the agency.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.426
And he's not going to stay forever,
I promise.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.343
Good.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.805
Because I really don't like
sharing you with your ex-husband.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.974
Well, not my ex exactly.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.392
Please don't remind me.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.690
[in French] What would you like?

24:43.773 --> 24:44.941
[man] I'll have a Kir Royale.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.111
A Kir Royale for me too please.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.156
[in English] Oh, my God.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.073
What?

24:53.825 --> 24:56.453
I think the universe
is trying to send me a message.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.848
We're going to go that way!

25:18.266 --> 25:19.100
[screaming]

25:31.613 --> 25:32.697
[both screaming]

25:34.616 --> 25:37.160
-Meet you at the ghost train?
-Yeah.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.339
How did you find me?

25:50.465 --> 25:53.426
Well, that's the thing
about your generation, Emily,

25:53.510 --> 25:55.262
not a shred of mystery.

25:55.345 --> 25:58.515
The whole world knows where you are,
all the time.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.143
Fair, but you never watch my stories.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.437
Although I'm always hoping you would.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.149
I know it was you
behind the Edgard and Cooper campaign.

26:09.192 --> 26:12.737
Did you think I wouldn't find out?
Or was that your intention all along?

26:12.821 --> 26:14.864
It's not that calculated.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.742
I was just trying to be helpful. Okay?

26:17.826 --> 26:19.744
I didn't want to waste
a perfectly good deck.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.496
So you gave your ideas away.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.958
What could you
possibly stand to gain from that?

26:25.458 --> 26:28.837
Sylvie, believe it or not,
I don't have an ulterior motive.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.797
I'm not Madeline.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.841
I really want you to succeed.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.593
With or without me.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.763
Yeah, but I'm too proud
to steal someone else's ideas.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.684
So we'll have to come
to some sort of arrangement.

26:44.811 --> 26:49.941
Oh, my God! Yes, I'm so there!

26:51.359 --> 26:53.695
No, I haven't asked you anything yet.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.657
Oh. Sorry.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.577
Well…

27:02.537 --> 27:03.580
Would you come back?

27:04.831 --> 27:06.333
I would be honored.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.834
I'll see you on Monday.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.586
Don't be early.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.088
Yes!

27:15.258 --> 27:16.426
[sighs in relief]

27:36.696 --> 27:38.990
I've got a meeting
with Antoine's board in 45 minutes.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.326
This is the last thing
I want to check off my list

27:41.409 --> 27:42.786
before going to work again.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.622
-Hello, welcome to <i>La Roue.</i>
-Thank you.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.499
[in French] After you.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.126
[in English] Thank you.

27:51.294 --> 27:52.379
Phew.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.296
<i>Merci.</i>

27:56.341 --> 27:58.385
You in the mood for some steak-frites?

27:58.885 --> 27:59.803
With you, Cooper?

28:00.637 --> 28:01.554
Absolutely.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.390
We've only got about four minutes.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.308
Challenge accepted.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.267
[chuckles]

28:39.676 --> 28:41.678
