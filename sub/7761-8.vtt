10:35.769 --> 10:38.071
- DECIDED TO LET YOU
SHOW MY STUFF.

10:38.105 --> 10:41.208
- HMM, BUT WHY,
AFTER I PUNCHED YOU?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.676
[phone rings]

10:42.710 --> 10:44.344
- [clears throat]
EXCUSE ME.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.346
[scoffs]

10:46.379 --> 10:48.148
WHAT?

10:48.181 --> 10:51.451
I ALREADY GAVE YOU MONEY,
YOU HEARTLESS BITCH.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.053
OH, YOU WANT MORE?

10:53.086 --> 10:55.188
WORK THE STREETS
LIKE THE WHORE THAT YOU ARE.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.690
[gasping]

10:56.724 --> 11:00.160
- [clears throat]
- MY WIFE.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.429
WE'RE ESTRANGED.
- I GATHERED.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.432
- ACTUALLY, ALL MY EX-WIVES
AND I ARE ESTRANGED.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.367
- I'M NOT SURPRISED.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.770
- IF I HAD ANY BRAINS,
I'D BE A LESBIAN LIKE YOU.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.104
- WHY'S THAT?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.840
- ALL THE PUSSY YOU WANT,
AND NO OVERHEAD.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.775
- YOU'RE REMARKABLE.
- [laughs]

11:14.808 --> 11:16.376
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY.

11:16.409 --> 11:21.314
MOSTLY GREEDY WIVES
AND GOLD DIGGERS.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.318
YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

11:25.352 --> 11:27.387
WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS

11:27.420 --> 11:30.190
TO FINALLY MEET A WOMAN
WHO WANTS NOTHING FROM ME

11:30.223 --> 11:32.492
EXCEPT TO SHOW MY WORK.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.195
BY THE WAY,
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO COOK?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.964
- I HAPPEN TO BE
AN EXCELLENT COOK.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.200
- YOU THINK ONE OF THEM EVEN
KNEW HOW TO TURN ON A STOVE?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.235
SO...
[sighs]

11:42.269 --> 11:47.074
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA INVITE ME
HOME FOR DINNER?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.977
[indistinct chatter]

11:50.010 --> 11:53.513
- I NEED ANOTHER BOTTLE
OF THE SHIRAZ.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.349
- WHEN I FIRST SAW RAGE,
I SAID, "FINALLY,

11:56.383 --> 11:59.352
SOMEBODY'S CREATED AN
HONEST-TO-GOD GAY SUPERHERO,"

11:59.386 --> 12:01.021
YOU KNOW, WHO'S OUT,

12:01.054 --> 12:03.223
WHO'S GOT A BOYFRIEND,
WHO ACTUALLY FUCKS.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.125
- YEAH, WELL, WE FIGURED
IF WE WERE GOING TO DO IT,

12:05.158 --> 12:06.493
WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT
ALL THE WAY.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.128
- AND YOU HAVE.
YOU'VE GIVEN EVERY KID

12:08.161 --> 12:09.429
WHO'S EVER BEEN BULLIED,

12:09.462 --> 12:11.164
WHO HAD TO KEEP
HIS TRUE IDENTITY A SECRET

12:11.198 --> 12:13.400
BUT SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO SURVIVE,

12:13.433 --> 12:16.403
HIS OWN CRUSADER,
HIS OWN ROLE MODEL.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.171
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS A KID.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.874
- THANK YOU, MR. KELLER.
- PLEASE, BRETT.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.976
AND I SHOULD BE
THANKING YOU.

12:23.010 --> 12:27.180
- UM, HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE
A COUPLE OF CONCERNS.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.416
- THAT SOMEONE MIGHT
WANT TO CHANGE THINGS.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.853
- YOU MEAN
LIKE MAKE RAGE STRAIGHT?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.521
I WILL PERSONALLY
CHOP THE DICK OFF

12:34.554 --> 12:37.024
ANY STUDIO EXECUTIVE
WHO EVEN TRIES.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.859
- [laughs]
- I WANT THIS FILM

12:38.892 --> 12:41.995
TO BE AS GRITTY AND AS DARK
AND AS EDGY AS YOUR COMIC.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.463
AND AS FOR RAGE,

12:43.496 --> 12:45.432
EVERY ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD
IS GOING TO WANT TO PLAY HIM.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.901
- I-I THOUGHT STRAIGHT ACTORS
WON'T TAKE GAY ROLES.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.437
- NAH, NOBODY'S GOING
TO TURN THIS ONE DOWN.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.005
SO, WHO DO YOU PICTURE?

12:52.039 --> 12:54.274
JOHNNY, ASHTON, MATT?

12:54.307 --> 12:56.944
- BRIAN.
- BRIAN?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.545
- HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.
- AND MY BEST FRIEND.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.180
WE BASED THE CHARACTER
AFTER HIM.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.215
- IS HE AS GORGEOUS AS RAGE?

13:02.249 --> 13:04.217
- MM-HMM.
- SOME PEOPLE THINK SO.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.153
- MOST PEOPLE THINK SO.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.890
- WELL, I'LL HAVE TO MEET HIM,
YOU KNOW, JUST TO GET AN IDEA.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.059
- UH, WHAT ABOUT
TOMORROW NIGHT?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.326
WE COULD ALL GO TO BABYLON.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.162
- UH, IT'S A DANCE CLUB.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.930
THEY'RE HAVING
A WET WILLIE CONTEST.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.033
- WHO SAID THERE'S NOTHING TO DO
IN PITTSBURGH?

13:20.067 --> 13:22.035
I WAS GOING TO FLY BACK
TO L.A. TOMORROW,

13:22.069 --> 13:24.037
BUT, UH...
[phone rings]

13:24.071 --> 13:26.073
SORRY.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.308
[chuckles]

13:28.341 --> 13:29.910
COLIN.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.845
[whispers]
FARRELL.

13:31.879 --> 13:35.815
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAVE GAYOPOLIS, HUH?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.498
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?

13:51.531 --> 13:54.367
- "SPEAK SOFTLY
AND CARRY A BIG DICK."

13:54.401 --> 13:56.503
HMM, CUTE.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.272
HOW ABOUT, UH, "EAT THIS"?

13:59.306 --> 14:00.941
- WHERE'D YOU SEE THAT ONE?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.609
- RIGHT HERE.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.511
- OH.
NO, THANKS, HONEY.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.213
- WOULD YOU EAT
A LITTLE SOMETHING, PLEASE?

14:06.246 --> 14:09.983
- MAYBE LATER.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.384
HERE, LET ME DO THAT.
I'M A LITTLE RUSTY.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.086
I OUGHT TO GET BACK IN SHAPE
FOR TOMORROW.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.555
- ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO GO BACK SO SOON?

14:15.588 --> 14:17.390
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE YOURSELF MORE TIME.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.894
- VIC'S ANGEL IS NOT
GOING TO PAY FOR ITSELF.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.629
AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE
THE BEST-LOOKING GRAVE

14:22.662 --> 14:23.897
IN THAT CEMETERY.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.232
[doorbell rings]

14:25.265 --> 14:27.367
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.969
IT'S PROBABLY MY SON

14:29.002 --> 14:30.570
TRYING TO TALK ME
OUT OF IT AGAIN.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.405
WELL, YOU CAN TELL HIM--

14:32.439 --> 14:34.541
NEVER MIND,
I'LL TELL HIM MYSELF.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.677
- DO I DETECT A DETECTIVE?
- HI, EMMETT.

14:37.710 --> 14:42.015
- I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
WHAT YOU SAY, MICHAEL, I'M...

14:44.084 --> 14:45.185
CARL.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.221
- HELLO, DEBBIE.

14:51.691 --> 14:55.028
- UM,
WE GOT YOUR FLOWERS.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.530
IT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU
TO REMEMBER VIC.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.033
- HE WAS A NICE GUY.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.603
- HE LIKED YOU TOO.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.206
- FORGIVE ME, I-I HAVEN'T
HAD TIME TO WRITE A NOTE.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.541
- I UNDERSTAND.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.277
- DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.612
WE'VE GOT SOME FRUITCAKE
LEFT OVER FROM CHRISTMAS.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.314
- EMMETT LIVES HERE NOW.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.449
I GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY
BUGGING THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.051
- ACTUALLY,
I JUST STOPPED BY TO SEE

15:18.085 --> 15:20.687
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO OUT
AND GRAB A BITE TO EAT.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.555
- TALK ABOUT ANGELS.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.358
SHE'D LOVE TO,
WOULDN'T YOU, DEB?

15:25.392 --> 15:27.060
JUST HAVE HER BACK
BY A DECENT HOUR.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.695
- [laughs]
- THANK YOU, UH, CARL,

15:28.728 --> 15:33.200
BUT I'M STARTING BACK TO WORK
AT THE DINER TOMORROW.

15:33.233 --> 15:37.470
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.474
- HE LOVES IT.
HE FUCKING LOVES IT.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.475
HE SAYS IT'S GENIUS.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.743
- THAT'S NICE.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.512
- HE ALSO SWEARS
THAT NO MATTER WHAT,

15:45.545 --> 15:47.080
THE CHARACTERS ARE GOING
TO STAY EXACTLY LIKE THEY ARE

15:47.114 --> 15:50.117
IN THE COMIC:
HARD-ASSED, EDGY, AND QUEER.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.751
- GREAT.
- [chuckles]

15:51.784 --> 15:53.586
OH, GET THIS.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.522
WHEN WE TOLD HIM WE BASED
THE CHARACTER OF RAGE ON YOU,

15:55.555 --> 15:57.457
HE SAYS,
"I HAVE TO MEET THIS GUY."

15:57.490 --> 15:59.726
SO WE MADE PLANS TO GO
TO BABYLON TOMORROW NIGHT,

15:59.759 --> 16:02.062
CONTINGENT, OF COURSE,
ON YOUR AVAILABILITY.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.730
- WELL,
I'LL HAVE TO GET MY TIGHTS

16:03.763 --> 16:06.199
BACK FROM THE CLEANERS.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.168
[zipper unzips]

16:10.137 --> 16:13.473
- WHAT, DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.742
- MUST'VE PULLED A MUSCLE
IN IBIZA.

16:15.775 --> 16:16.776
- [laughs]
YEAH.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.979
I BET I CAN GUESS WHICH ONE.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.219
YOU KNOW,
YOU LOOK REALLY TIRED.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.422
- JUST JETLAG.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.392
I'M FABULOSO, SEÑOR.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.630
- WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME THING ABOUT THE SHORTS.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.168
HEY, DON'T JACK OFF IN THERE.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.371
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.406
[phone rings, water running]

16:46.439 --> 16:51.778
BRIAN, YOU WANT ME
TO GET THE PHONE?

16:51.811 --> 16:56.049
- LEAVE ME A MESSAGE.
[beeping]

16:56.083 --> 16:58.151
- HELLO, MR. KINNEY,
THIS IS DR. RABINOWITZ

16:58.185 --> 17:00.420
FROM THE JOHNS HOPKINS
ONCOLOGY CENTER.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.655
I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS
YOUR POST-SURGERY OPTIONS,

17:02.689 --> 17:08.161
SO PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL
AT 410-555-4832.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.429
[beep]

17:09.462 --> 17:12.799
BRIAN...

17:12.832 --> 17:16.269
WHEN I TOLD
MY DEAR AUNT FAY THAT I WANTED

17:16.303 --> 17:17.704
TO PAINT HER SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR HER 80th BIRTHDAY,

17:17.737 --> 17:20.073
SHE SAYS, "SAMMY,
I NEVER LIKED YOUR PAINTINGS,

17:20.107 --> 17:21.608
BUT THE BEDROOM
COULD SURE USE A FRESH COAT."

17:21.641 --> 17:22.609
[laughter]

17:22.642 --> 17:24.177
- SOUNDS LIKE MY AUNT RITA.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.445
- WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT FAMILY.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.546
THEY NEVER APPRECIATE
YOUR WORK.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.680
- AH, NOT IN THIS HOUSE.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.283
I LOVE LINDSAY'S PAINTINGS.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.752
- YOU PAINT?
- I DABBLE.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.555
- UH-HUH.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.457
- THAT'S LIKE SAYING
TO JONAS SALK,

17:37.490 --> 17:39.459
"I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A VACCINE
IN MY BASEMENT."

17:39.492 --> 17:42.362
- SHE'S FAR TOO MODEST,
SO I'LL BOAST FOR HER.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.863
- MEL!
- SHUT UP.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.332
SHE WENT TO CARNEGIE MELLON,

17:45.365 --> 17:46.566
HAD HER PAINTINGS
IN A FEW EXHIBITS.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.734
- I'M IMPRESSED.
- OH, DON'T BE.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.769
THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.704
- WHY DON'T YOU SHOW SAM?
- NO.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.206
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.175
- I'M SURE THAT SHE
IS VERY SHY

17:55.208 --> 17:56.376
ABOUT LETTING ANYONE
SEE HER WORK,

17:56.409 --> 17:57.377
WHICH I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.445
- THANK YOU, SAM.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.580
- BUT I SAY, "GET OVER IT."

18:00.613 --> 18:03.783
EVERY ARTIST IS A SELF-CENTERED,
EGOMANIACAL FASCIST.

18:03.816 --> 18:09.522
SO, SPARE ME
THE MODESTY SHIT, HMM?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.624
HMM.

18:11.658 --> 18:15.195
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.797
- COME ON.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.499
HOW MANY TIMES
DO YOU HAVE A FAMOUS ARTIST

18:19.532 --> 18:22.635
TO CRITIQUE YOUR WORK,
SHARE HIS CREATIVE INSIGHT?

18:22.669 --> 18:25.104
WHAT DO YOU THINK, SAM?

18:30.677 --> 18:32.912
- PRETTY COLORS.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.782
- THAT IT?
- I LIKE THE--

18:35.815 --> 18:38.518
THE DOODLE IN THE CORNER.
- OH...

18:38.551 --> 18:40.220
- CUTE.
- "CUTE."

18:40.253 --> 18:41.921
I THINK SAM'S SEEN ENOUGH.
- HEY...

18:41.954 --> 18:43.623
- WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME?
WHAT THE FUCK DO I KNOW

18:43.656 --> 18:45.358
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S ART?
I JUST MAKE MY OWN.

18:45.392 --> 18:46.359
- FAIR ENOUGH.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.428
- MORE IMPORTANTLY...

18:48.461 --> 18:53.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:53.266 --> 18:56.269
- I THINK THEY'RE ACADEMIC,
DERIVATIVE, UNINSPIRED,

18:56.303 --> 18:58.271
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME REASON

18:58.305 --> 19:01.241
WHY I STOPPED PAINTING.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.910
- WELL, SOMETHING
MUST HAVE INSPIRED YOU ONCE.

19:03.943 --> 19:08.415
- THERE'S THIS.
I LOVE THIS.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.518
HMM?

19:11.551 --> 19:13.486
- [clears throat]

19:19.459 --> 19:21.828
- OH, YEAH.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.197
THERE WAS THIS OLD HOMELESS MAN
I USED TO PASS

19:24.231 --> 19:27.467
EVERY DAY ON MY WAY
TO CLASS.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.569
HIS FACE WAS LINED, HAUNTED,

19:29.602 --> 19:32.405
AS IF HE WERE STARING
AT DEATH--

19:32.439 --> 19:36.976
OR WORSE,
THE FAILURE OF HIS LIFE.

19:37.009 --> 19:41.681
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I HAD TO SKETCH HIM.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.718
HMM.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.824
[door opens, bell jingles]

19:51.858 --> 19:53.293
- HEY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:53.326 --> 19:54.461
I THOUGHT
I'D PUT HIM OUT FRONT

19:54.494 --> 19:57.797
WHEN THE NEXT ISSUE
COMES OUT.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.702
WHAT'S WRONG?
DON'T YOU LIKE HIM?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.604
- DID YOU KNOW?

20:04.637 --> 20:08.475
- HUH?

20:08.508 --> 20:12.845
- DID YOU KNOW?

20:12.879 --> 20:16.883
- KNOW WHAT?
- ABOUT BRIAN.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.618
HE DIDN'T GO TO IBIZA.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.754
- WELL, WHERE'D HE GO?
SOUTH BEACH? CANCUN?

20:21.788 --> 20:26.259
- JOHNS HOPKINS.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.627
IT'S A HOSPITAL
IN BALTIMORE.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.898
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.502
WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE?

20:35.535 --> 20:37.770
- THERE WAS A MESSAGE
FROM A DR. RABINOWITZ

20:37.804 --> 20:43.476
ON HIS MACHINE,
CHECKING UP ON HIS SURGERY...

20:43.510 --> 20:47.347
AND TO DISCUSS
FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.350
SO I CALLED THE HOSPITAL
TO SEE WHO DOCTOR RABINOWITZ IS,

20:50.383 --> 20:52.885
AND HE'S AN ONCOLOGIST

20:52.919 --> 20:55.788
WHO SPECIALIZES
IN TESTICULAR CANCER.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.562
- OH, GOD.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.265
- [clears throat]
SO YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.973
WELL, IF HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
AND HE DIDN'T TELL ME,

21:14.006 --> 21:17.310
THEN WHO DID HE TELL?

21:19.078 --> 21:21.814
- MY GUESS IS NOBODY.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.684
- THAT HE HAS CANCER?

21:27.354 --> 21:30.056
- WELL, I'M SURE
IF HE WANTED US TO KNOW,

21:30.089 --> 21:32.091
HE WOULD'VE TOLD US.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.427
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.695
JUST KEEP OUR MOUTHS SHUT?

21:35.728 --> 21:38.965
ACT LIKE WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING?

21:38.998 --> 21:40.733
- IF THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS,

21:40.767 --> 21:45.104
THEN THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.307
- [sighs]

21:50.710 --> 21:53.680
[dance music]

21:53.713 --> 21:57.350
*

21:57.384 --> 22:00.720
- ENDOVIR'S SALES ARE UP 15%

22:00.753 --> 22:02.955
SINCE WE LAUNCHED
THEIR LAST CAMPAIGN,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.557
AND THEY'D LIKE TO REBOOK

22:04.591 --> 22:06.426
FOR NEXT MONTH'S ISSUE
OF THE ADVOCATE

22:06.459 --> 22:08.461
AS WELL AS...

22:08.495 --> 22:12.131
POZ AND HEAT.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.633
SO, TED,
WE'RE GOING TO NEED RATES.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.702
- OH, RIGHT ON IT.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.570
- AND WE'RE ALSO
GOING TO NEED A NEW CAMPAIGN

22:17.604 --> 22:19.105
TO FOLLOW THIS ONE.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.474
- I ALREADY HAVE SOME SKETCHES
FOR YOU TO LOOK OVER.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.575
- AND I'VE GOT COPY
TO GO WITH THEM.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.743
- NICE GOING.

22:23.776 --> 22:28.014
NOW, WHAT ABOUT,
UH, BROWN ATHLETICS?

22:28.047 --> 22:30.149
[pained]
DID WE...

22:30.182 --> 22:31.851
GET THE CONTRACTS?

22:31.884 --> 22:34.621
- CAME IN YESTERDAY
WITH A 10 GRAND DEPOSIT.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.855
- ALREADY IN THE BANK.

22:35.888 --> 22:36.923

22:36.956 --> 22:37.990
- BRIAN?

22:38.024 --> 22:41.894
- YOU OKAY?
- BRIAN?

22:44.163 --> 22:47.500
- YEAH.
[clears throat]

22:47.534 --> 22:49.902
YEAH, I JUST, UH...

22:49.936 --> 22:54.774
EXCUSE ME FOR JUST ONE SECOND.

23:06.686 --> 23:07.954

23:07.987 --> 23:11.924
- I'M FINE.
[clears throat]

23:11.958 --> 23:13.092
- WELL, YOU SURE AS HELL
DON'T LOOK IT.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.027
YOU PRACTICALLY FAINTED
IN THERE.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.029
- YEAH, I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED
FROM MY TRIP, THAT'S ALL.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.631
- WELL,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.699
I MEAN, WE CAN
FINISH THIS TOMORR--

23:19.732 --> 23:21.801
- I SAID I'M FINE.

23:21.834 --> 23:25.538
NOW LET'S FINISH
THE GODDAMN MEETING.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.207
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SO TESTY.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.043
[indistinct chatter]

23:31.077 --> 23:33.646
- ONE PINK PLATE.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.716
ONE MEATLOAF.
- UH, POT PIE.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.052
- POT PIE.
SORRY, FIRST DAY BACK AND ALL.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.188
SO WHO IN THE FUCK
HAD THE MEATLOAF?

23:42.221 --> 23:43.556
- MEATLOAF!

23:43.590 --> 23:45.191
- WHAT DID YOU DO,
CHANGE TABLES?

23:45.224 --> 23:47.994
SORRY, HONEY.
THERE YOU GO.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.863
HOW'S MY FAVORITE
PERSONAL SERVICE PROFESSIONAL?

23:50.897 --> 23:53.733
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FOR CARLOS
AT THE HOUSE OF MASSAGE.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.668
- I'M DOING FINE.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.937
- WELL, I THOUGHT IF YOU'RE
DONE, I'D ESCORT YOU HOME.

23:57.970 --> 24:02.008
- WELL, HOW "TRAY" GALLANT.
[laughs]

24:02.041 --> 24:03.242
BUT I DON'T GET OFF
TILL 1:30.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.677
- OH, WELL THAT'S
JUST HALF AN--

24:04.711 --> 24:06.879
- A.M.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.548
I TOOK ANOTHER SHIFT.

24:08.581 --> 24:11.718
WHO DO YOU HAVE TO FUCK
TO GET SERVICE AROUND HERE?

24:11.751 --> 24:15.021
- ME, WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GOING
TO BE WAITING A LONG TIME.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.989
- SORRY, HONEY.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

24:17.023 --> 24:19.025
- I'M THE PEA SOUP, REMEMBER?

24:19.058 --> 24:22.562
- OH, RIGHT.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.130
- DEBBIE?
- CAN I GET A PEA SOUP, PLEASE?

24:24.163 --> 24:26.966

24:26.999 --> 24:28.835

A FRIEND OF VIC'S.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.706
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
HOW SORRY I WAS

24:33.740 --> 24:34.841
TO HEAR OF HIS PASSING.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.242
- OH, THANKS.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.877
- HE WAS ALWAYS SAYING

24:37.910 --> 24:40.246
WHAT A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
YOU TWO HAD...

24:40.279 --> 24:42.014
HOW HE LOOKED UP TO YOU.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.516
YOU WERE MORE THAN A SISTER,

24:43.550 --> 24:47.019
YOU WERE, UH,
HIS BEST FRIEND.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.057
- SORRY, I HAVE
TO GET THIS ORDER.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.760
- I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW,

24:53.793 --> 24:55.595
BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE
THE COMFORT OF KNOWING

24:55.628 --> 24:58.898
HOW MUCH HE LOVED YOU.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.173
- [sighs]

25:10.910 --> 25:14.280
[laughter and chatter]

25:14.313 --> 25:17.049
- [crying softly]

25:18.117 --> 25:20.052
[loud clatter]

25:26.793 --> 25:30.663
- DEB.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.899
DEBBIE?
- HUH?

25:32.932 --> 25:34.767
- COME--COME SIT DOWN.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.937
COME SIT DOWN.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.943
- TOLD HER IT WAS TOO SOON.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.178
- I GOT A LITTLE SHAKY,
THAT'S ALL.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.914
I DIDN'T HAVE MY SEA LEGS
BACK YET.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.216
I'LL BE BETTER TOMORROW.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.785
- YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK
TOMORROW, OR THE NEXT DAY.

25:52.819 --> 25:53.786
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
A FEW WEEKS OFF--

25:53.820 --> 25:54.854
- THE HELL I AM!

25:54.887 --> 25:58.658
- WOULD YOU CALM DOWN,
PLEASE?

25:58.691 --> 26:00.192
- WE ARE JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR YOUR BEST INTEREST.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.095
I KNOW WHAT
MY BEST INTEREST IS.

26:03.129 --> 26:06.265
IT'S TO WORK, SO I CAN PAY
FOR VIC'S MONUMENT.

26:06.298 --> 26:09.836
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO KILL YOURSELF.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.338
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.107
YOU DON'T HAVE
A FUCKING CLUE.

26:15.141 --> 26:19.111
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME A FUCKING HINT?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.692
- THEY'RE ALL SO VIBRANT,
SO DYNAMIC.

26:32.725 --> 26:33.826
I DON'T KNOW WHICH TO CHOOSE.

26:33.860 --> 26:37.697
- MMM.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.265
TAKE 'EM ALL.

26:39.298 --> 26:43.169
- A SIMPLE
AND PRACTICAL SOLUTION.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.170
[clinks bottle]

26:44.203 --> 26:47.306
- HM?
- HM-MM.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.776
- YOU SURPRISE ME.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.311
- OH?
- HMM.

26:52.344 --> 26:56.415
I MEAN, TO LOOK AT YOU...
NO ONE WOULD EVER SUSPECT...

26:56.448 --> 26:58.918
- THAT I'M A LESBIAN?

26:58.951 --> 27:01.320
- THAT A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE
COULD BE SMART,

27:01.353 --> 27:03.322
HONEST, FUNNY...

27:03.355 --> 27:05.725
AND SUPREMELY TALENTED.

27:05.758 --> 27:09.328
- WELL, IT'S NOT THAT UNCOMMON.
- OH, IT'S NOT?

27:09.361 --> 27:12.064
- WELL, HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE
YOU ACTUALLY BOTHERED TO KNOW,

27:12.098 --> 27:14.867
OR LET KNOW YOU, BEFORE YOU
FUCKED THEM, OR MARRIED THEM?

27:14.901 --> 27:16.769
[both laugh]

27:16.803 --> 27:19.405
AND AS FOR MY TALENT,
WELL...

27:19.438 --> 27:22.208
JUDGING FROM YOUR RESPONSE,
IT WAS ANYTHING BUT SUPREME.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.410
- NO, NO, SEE,
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.012
THAT DRAWING YOU DID
OF THE HOMELESS MAN?

27:26.045 --> 27:27.413
HOO-HOO.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.749
- I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN YEARS.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.050
- YOU SHOULD.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.819
- MAYBE SOME DAY.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.754
- WHY NOT NOW?

27:34.787 --> 27:37.690
- NOW, I'M TOO BUSY
BEING A WIFE, A MOTHER.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.058
- HMM.
- AND THEN THERE'S MY WORK.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.060
- OH, PLEASE.
SPARE ME THE EXCUSES, LADY.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.029
IF YOU'RE AN ARTIST,
NOTHING STOPS YOU.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.897
I COULD BE GOING DOWN
IN A PLANE,

27:44.931 --> 27:46.766
TAKING A DUMP,
SCREWING MY LAST MISTRESS,

27:46.799 --> 27:49.335
I'D STILL REACH FOR A PAD.

27:49.368 --> 27:52.338
HERE.
[clears throat]

27:55.241 --> 27:57.176
DRAW SOMETHING.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.779
- NOW?
- MM-HMM.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.313
- WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DRAW?

28:01.347 --> 28:03.315
- WHATEVER THE HELL
INSPIRES YOU.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.417
A CHAIR, AN APPLE.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.454
- YOU?

28:08.487 --> 28:10.723
- [chuckles]

28:10.757 --> 28:12.458
ME?

28:12.491 --> 28:15.427
- YOU.

28:18.397 --> 28:21.834
- FINE.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.870
- UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:23.903 --> 28:26.472
- WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?
- NO, NO, NO, SAM, WAIT.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.007
NO, YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE TO TAKE OFF YOUR--

28:28.040 --> 28:29.075
- AH, THERE WE GO.
- NO.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.811
- THE HUMAN BODY.
[sniffs]

28:31.844 --> 28:33.846
IT'S INSPIRED ARTISTS
FOR CENTURIES.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.383
- OH, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

28:37.416 --> 28:40.820
FEW DO.
[clears throat]

28:40.853 --> 28:43.756

29:01.974 --> 29:04.977
- MY, WHAT A BIG COCK
YOU HAVE.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.247
- FUCK.
IS THAT THING REAL?

29:08.280 --> 29:09.882
- IT'S REAL, ALL RIGHT,

29:09.916 --> 29:12.051
BUT YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR EYES
BACK IN YOUR PANTS.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.387
HE'S A BOTTOM.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.989
- WHY DON'T WE GET OUT OF HERE?

29:17.023 --> 29:18.858
- THE NIGHT'S STILL UNDER 30.

29:18.891 --> 29:19.859
- NOT TOO HARD.

29:19.892 --> 29:20.993
- HEY!
- OW!

29:21.027 --> 29:23.395
- YOU PLAY HARD.
- HOW ARE YOU?

29:23.429 --> 29:24.931
I MEAN, HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

29:24.964 --> 29:27.333
- I ALMOST DIDN'T COME BACK.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.268
- WE WOULD HAVE MISSED YOU.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.803
- THIS MUST BE HIM.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.872
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE RAGE.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.541
- BRIAN,
THIS IS BRETT KELLER.

29:35.574 --> 29:38.277
- AH, THE BOY WONDER
OF HOLLYWOOD.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.212
[laughs]

29:40.246 --> 29:42.348
- SOUNDS LIKE HIM TOO.

29:42.381 --> 29:46.352

AND I DO MEAN BIG WINNER,

29:46.385 --> 29:50.356

YOU MOVE SO RIGHT *

29:59.065 --> 30:00.833
* TAKE ME TONIGHT

30:00.867 --> 30:02.434
- YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION
TO THIS YEAR'S BIG WINNER,

30:02.468 --> 30:06.438
THERE'S ALSO SOME BIG LOSERS.

30:06.472 --> 30:10.376
I THINK I'LL GO
AND CONSOLE THEM.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.615
- WHY DID YOU LET HIM COME HERE?
HE SHOULD BE HOME RESTING.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.819
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO STOP HIM
WHEN I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

30:23.222 --> 30:24.991
- I'M GOING
TO RECREATE THIS PLACE

30:25.024 --> 30:27.927
EXACTLY AS IT IS
FOR THE MOVIE.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.461
- SEE?
I TOLD YOU SO.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.263
YOU KNOW,
BEN'S A WRITER, TOO.

30:31.297 --> 30:34.934
- SCREENPLAYS?
- BOOKS.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.335
JUST FINISHED A NOVEL.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.870
- WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

30:37.904 --> 30:40.472
- IT'S A LOVE STORY
BETWEEN TWO MEN,

30:40.506 --> 30:42.942
SET IN PARIS IN THE '30s.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.343
- PERIOD PIECES
ARE A TOUGH SELL.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.345
- I WASN'T PLANNING
TO SELL IT.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.949
BESIDES, I'M SURE
IT'S NOT YOUR THING.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.350
- AND WHAT IS?

30:51.383 --> 30:53.619
- MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT
FOR 12-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.254
- JESUS, BEN.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.622
- NO, I'D LIKE TO HEAR
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.624
PLEASE, CONTINUE.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.928
- WELL, CONSIDERING YOU'RE GAY,
AND THAT YOU PRETTY MUCH

31:01.961 --> 31:03.562
HAVE THE POWER
TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT,

31:03.595 --> 31:05.898
ONE WOULD THINK YOU MIGHT DO
A PROJECT WITH SOME RELEVANCE,

31:05.932 --> 31:08.534
SOME SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.238

YOU MOVE SO RIGHT *

31:12.271 --> 31:13.906
* TAKE ME TONIGHT

31:13.940 --> 31:16.408
- BRIAN. HEY.

31:16.442 --> 31:17.643
I'M NOT FEELING TOO WELL.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.511
I THINK IT MIGHT BE
FOOD POISONING.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.514
- WELL, YOU SHOULD GO THEN.

31:22.548 --> 31:27.253
- WILL YOU COME WITH ME?
PLEASE?

31:27.286 --> 31:30.256
- I GUESS YOU LOSE AGAIN.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.658
*

31:32.691 --> 31:35.294
- "RELEVANCE"?
"SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY"?

31:35.327 --> 31:37.263
HOW COULD YOU
INSULT HIM LIKE THAT?

31:37.296 --> 31:39.598
- THE GUY IS A FRAUD.
HE'S AN UNTALENTED HACK.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.433
- WELL,
THAT MAY BE YOUR OPINION,

31:41.467 --> 31:43.135
BUT HE HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DIRECTORS

31:43.169 --> 31:44.136
IN HOLLYWOOD.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.471
- [scoffs]

31:45.504 --> 31:47.940
- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING SUCCESSFUL.

31:47.974 --> 31:51.277
- AS LONG
AS YOU DON'T SELL OUT.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.145
- WHO'S TALKING
ABOUT SELLING OUT?

31:53.179 --> 31:54.546
- DON'T BE NAIVE.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.082
DO YOU THINK
BRETT KELLER'S SUCCESSFUL

31:56.115 --> 31:58.084
BECAUSE HE MAINTAINED
HIS ARTISTIC INTEGRITY?

31:58.117 --> 32:01.020
- HE LOVES WHAT HE DOES
AND HE'S DAMN GOOD AT IT.

32:01.053 --> 32:04.156
- YOU SHOULD FIT IN PERFECTLY
OUT IN HOLLYWOOD.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.092
- YOU KNOW,
I MAY NOT BE THE BRILLIANT,

32:06.125 --> 32:08.560
UNCOMPROMISING GENIUS
THAT YOU ARE,

32:08.594 --> 32:10.296
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK?

32:10.329 --> 32:12.364
I THINK THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ARTISTIC INTEGRITY.

32:12.398 --> 32:15.601
I THINK THAT YOU'RE JEALOUS
BECAUSE SOMEBODY

32:15.634 --> 32:19.205
WANTS TO MAKE A BIG MOVIE
OUT OF OUR COMIC BOOK

32:19.238 --> 32:21.573
AND NO ONE
WILL TOUCH YOUR NOVEL.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.209
[door slams]

32:30.516 --> 32:34.486
- LET ME HELP.

32:34.520 --> 32:38.390
- I CAN DO IT.
- I KNOW YOU CAN.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.133
- [sighs]
- I GOT IT.

33:21.267 --> 33:24.570
- I THOUGHT
YOU HAD FOOD POISONING.

33:24.603 --> 33:28.407
- WELL, I GUESS
IT WAS JUST A TUMMY ACHE.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.413
- [sighs]

33:34.446 --> 33:37.583
- TELL ME ABOUT IBIZA.

33:41.553 --> 33:45.491
- [moans]

33:47.559 --> 33:52.164
IT WAS LIKE I DIED
AND WENT TO HOMO HEAVEN.

33:54.166 --> 33:59.037
BEAUTIFUL GUYS,
ALL DRESSED IN WHITE.

34:02.774 --> 34:06.278
AND EVERYWHERE YOU WENT...

34:06.312 --> 34:09.548
IT SMELLED LIKE...

34:09.581 --> 34:13.552
LEMON-SCENTED AIR FRESHENER.

34:13.585 --> 34:17.223
- IT SOUNDS GREAT.

34:17.256 --> 34:20.826
- I EVEN FUCKED A MATADOR.

34:20.859 --> 34:23.795
- NO WAY.
- [laughs]

34:26.232 --> 34:29.801
OLE.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.361
- [sniffling]

35:07.573 --> 35:10.509
[exhales]

35:14.813 --> 35:16.815
- MIKEY.

35:16.848 --> 35:20.786
TIME TO GET U-UP OR YOU'LL
BE LATE FOR SCHOO-OOL.

35:20.819 --> 35:21.920
- [groans]

35:21.953 --> 35:25.123
- [puffs air]

35:26.825 --> 35:29.795
GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR, NOW!

35:29.828 --> 35:31.530
- [laughs]

35:31.563 --> 35:34.366
THAT'S JUST HOW MY MOM
USED TO WAKE ME UP.

35:34.400 --> 35:38.304
- OH, AND DID SHE ALSO
BRING YOU CAPPUCCINO

35:38.337 --> 35:40.772
AND A CHOCOLATE CROISSANT?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.574
- THANKS FOR LETTING ME CRASH.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.776
- AH, YOU CAN COME TO MAMA'S
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.912
- CAREFUL, OR YOU MIGHT END UP
WITH A PERMANENT HOUSEGUEST.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.314
- [chuckles]

35:48.347 --> 35:49.948
I'M SURE
AS SOON AS YOU GET BACK,

35:49.981 --> 35:51.783
YOU AND BEN WILL FALL
INTO EACH OTHER'S ARMS

35:51.817 --> 35:53.585
AND KISS AND MAKE UP.

35:53.619 --> 35:56.655
- NOT UNTIL HE STOPS ACTING
LIKE A JEALOUS ASSHOLE.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.925
- YEAH, I DID THE SAME THING
WHEN EMMETT'S PARTY PLANNING

35:59.958 --> 36:02.228
STARTED TAKING OFF.

36:02.261 --> 36:06.798
THE MORE SUCCESSFUL HE GOT,
THE MORE I RESENTED IT.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.800
- MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.802
- WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

36:10.836 --> 36:13.572
HOW OFTEN DOES AN OPPORTUNITY
LIKE THIS COME ALONG?

36:13.605 --> 36:15.807
[imitates buzzer]
TIME'S UP. NEVER!

36:15.841 --> 36:18.344
- BUT IF IT'S GOING TO CAUSE
ALL THESE PROBLEMS--

36:18.377 --> 36:21.347
- LOOK, YOU CAN'T TURN YOURSELF
INTO A FAILURE

36:21.380 --> 36:26.418
TO MAKE YOUR RELATIONSHIP
A SUCCESS.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.488
- THANKS, MAMA.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.756
- ANY TIME.

36:30.789 --> 36:35.627
- DOCTOR STRANGE
NUMBER 169.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.596
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THIS
ON EBAY FOR MONTHS.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.298
HOW MUCH DO I, UH--

36:39.331 --> 36:41.233
- THAT'S OUR GIFT TO YOU.
- OH, THANKS, GUYS.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.501
- UH, EXCUSE ME,
MR. KELLER,

36:42.534 --> 36:43.769
WE NEED TO GET YOU
TO THE AIRPORT

36:43.802 --> 36:44.870
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE YOUR FLIGHT.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.372
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.706
GUYS, I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

36:47.739 --> 36:50.476
- THANKS, BRETT.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.978
- THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
- OKAY, LISTEN.

36:53.011 --> 36:56.348
IF WE CAN'T GET, UH, COLIN
OR ASHTON TO PLAY RAGE,

36:56.382 --> 36:59.885
WE'LL GET, UH, BRIAN.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.992
- HOW'S HE DOING?

37:07.025 --> 37:09.528
- HE'S STILL PRETENDING
LIKE EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT,

37:09.561 --> 37:14.032
AND I'M STILL PRETENDING
LIKE I DON'T KNOW.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.503
FUCK THIS SHIT.
I'M TELLING HIM.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.871
- YOU CAN'T.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.873
HE WANTS IT THIS WAY.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.343
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
HE'S NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.745
YOU DON'T LOVE HIM.

37:26.778 --> 37:30.682
- I LOVE HIM ENOUGH
TO HONOR HIS WISHES.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.620
- SHE AND VIC
HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.688
NOW SHE THINKS
HE'LL NEVER FORGIVE HER,

37:36.722 --> 37:38.690
SO SHE THREW HIM THIS
POSTHUMOUS CHRISTMAS PARTY,

37:38.724 --> 37:40.892
WHICH HAS GOT TO BE A FIRST,
BUT THE ANGEL BROKE.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.761
SO SHE BOUGHT HIM
THIS HEADSTONE

37:42.794 --> 37:45.397
WITH A LIFE-SIZE FIGURE
OF GABRIEL TOOTING HIS TRUMPET--

37:45.431 --> 37:47.433
DEFINITELY NOT THE SORT OF
BLOW JOB VIC WAS INTERESTED IN.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.435
- NOW, HOLD IT, SLOW DOWN.
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

37:49.468 --> 37:52.438
- THE POINT IS, CARL,
NO ONE CAN GET THROUGH TO HER.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.507
NOT ME, NOT MICHAEL.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.042
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME,

37:57.075 --> 37:58.910
AS SURE AS I KNOW
THERE'S A SHIRT IN YOUR CLOSET

37:58.944 --> 38:00.512
THAT'S A BETTER MATCH
FOR THOSE POLYESTER PANTS

38:00.546 --> 38:03.315
THAN THE ONE YOU'VE GOT ON,
THAT, UH...

38:03.349 --> 38:05.717
THAT YOU CAN.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.587
- DIDN'T SEEM
SO THE OTHER DAY.

38:08.620 --> 38:12.324
- TRUST ME, I UNDERSTAND.

38:12.358 --> 38:16.595
A TIME LIKE THIS,
A GIRL NEEDS A MAN.

38:25.571 --> 38:26.738
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.740
- SINCE WHEN?

38:28.774 --> 38:31.076
- [sighs]

38:31.109 --> 38:34.880
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU
SO HAPPY.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.549
- THANKS TO A CERTAIN
MADMAN FRIEND OF MINE.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.852
- OH, MY GOD!
- [laughs]

38:40.886 --> 38:42.354
- DID HE POSE FOR YOU
LIKE THAT?

38:42.388 --> 38:46.124
- WITH NOTHING BUT A CIGAR.
- [laughs]

38:46.157 --> 38:47.893
HE REALLY IS MAD.

38:47.926 --> 38:51.096
IN A WONDERFUL,
INFURIATING, GENEROUS,

38:51.129 --> 38:52.698
SELF-CENTERED SORT OF WAY.

38:52.731 --> 38:56.435
- MM-HMM.
- [laughs]

38:56.468 --> 39:00.406
- I'M GLAD HE'S INSPIRED YOU.

39:04.810 --> 39:08.747
NIGHT-NIGHT.

39:18.189 --> 39:22.127
- [laughs]

39:22.160 --> 39:23.862
[rock music]

39:23.895 --> 39:28.033
- * WORDS HAVE NO MEANING
AND THE SUN IS DIM *

39:28.066 --> 39:31.937
*

39:31.970 --> 39:35.541
* CAN'T THINK ABOUT
ANYTHING BUT HIM *

39:35.574 --> 39:38.644
- LINDA HURLEY.

39:38.677 --> 39:41.179
- WHO?

39:41.212 --> 39:44.950
- LINDA HURLEY.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.620
AKA "LINDA THE HURLER."

39:48.654 --> 39:50.422
- [laughs]

39:50.456 --> 39:53.191
- I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK
OF HER NAME ALL DAY LONG.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.827
- CHRIST, WHAT MADE YOU
SUDDENLY THINK OF HER?

39:55.861 --> 39:59.665
- YOUR LAST FORAY
INTO SHOWBIZ.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.700
- [chuckles]

40:01.733 --> 40:05.170
LET'S HOPE THIS TIME
I WON'T HAVE TO BE HOSED DOWN.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.773
- [laughs]

40:07.806 --> 40:09.575
TELL ME THE STORY, MIKEY.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.543
- YOU ALREADY KNOW THE STORY.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.580
- I DON'T CARE.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.616
TELL IT TO ME AGAIN.

40:20.085 --> 40:25.190
- IT WAS THE JUNIOR CLASS
PRESENTATION OF OUR TOWN.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.958
- MM-HMM.

40:26.992 --> 40:31.697
- AND SOMEHOW I HAD LANDED
THE PART OF GEORGE.

40:31.730 --> 40:35.534
AND LINDA...
WAS EMILY.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.102
- [laughs]

40:37.135 --> 40:41.072
- AND IT WAS
THAT TENDER MOMENT

40:41.106 --> 40:44.209
AT THE END OF ACT TWO
WHERE THEY KISS.

40:44.242 --> 40:47.746
- [laughs]
AND SHE PUKED ALL OVER YOU.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.681
- SHE HAD THE FLU.

40:49.715 --> 40:52.951
- YEAH, IT FLEW, ALL RIGHT.
[laughs]

40:52.984 --> 40:55.554
- WELL,
THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED

40:55.587 --> 40:59.024
IT WAS NOT AN ACTOR'S LIFE
FOR ME.

40:59.057 --> 41:02.160
- NOW HOLLYWOOD'S
CALLING AND...

41:02.193 --> 41:03.161
[exhales]

41:03.194 --> 41:09.134
RAGE: THE MOVIE.

41:11.737 --> 41:14.673
- HE WOULDN'T EXIST
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.179
SO ARE YOU GOING
TO COME TO THE PREMIERE?

41:21.212 --> 41:24.182
- [groans]

41:24.215 --> 41:27.152
WHY WOULDN'T I?

41:29.688 --> 41:31.923
- I WANT IT TO BE
AT THAT THEATRE, UM,

41:31.957 --> 41:35.994
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH
ALL THE STARS' FOOTPRINTS.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.863
WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF...

41:37.896 --> 41:41.867
WE HAD OUR FOOTPRINTS
IN THE CEMENT?

41:41.900 --> 41:44.603
MICHAEL AND BRIAN...

41:44.636 --> 41:47.573
IMMORTALIZED FOREVER.

41:49.641 --> 41:52.578
JUST YOU AND ME.

41:58.183 --> 42:01.987
- [sighs]

42:09.661 --> 42:14.766
- [crying softly]

42:14.800 --> 42:17.168
[low]
SHIT.

42:17.202 --> 42:20.606
- MICHAEL?

42:23.208 --> 42:27.112
MIKEY?

42:27.145 --> 42:28.780
- [crying]
I'M SORRY.

42:28.814 --> 42:33.118
- FOR WHAT?
- [sniffling]

42:35.854 --> 42:38.824
I KNOW.

42:42.127 --> 42:45.731
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
GO TO IBIZA.

42:47.866 --> 42:52.203
I KNOW YOU
WENT TO JOHNS HOPKINS...

42:52.237 --> 42:56.041
AND YOU HAD SURGERY FOR--
OH, GOD.

42:57.776 --> 43:02.080
IF I LOSE YOU,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

43:02.113 --> 43:06.051
[crying]

43:08.987 --> 43:11.857
- HEY.
[clears throat]

43:11.890 --> 43:14.225
LOOK, I'M OKAY,
I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.361
- [sobbing]

43:16.394 --> 43:21.232
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU.

43:21.266 --> 43:25.036
I TOLD HIM NOT TO TELL.

43:25.070 --> 43:28.740
- WHO?
- JUSTIN.

43:28.774 --> 43:32.110
HE OVERHEARD THE DOCTOR LEAVING
A MESSAGE ON YOUR MACHINE,

43:32.143 --> 43:36.114
AND HE--
HE CALLED THE HOSPITAL.

43:36.147 --> 43:41.720
*

43:41.753 --> 43:44.122
- SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET
IS A COVERLET.

43:44.155 --> 43:45.991
A COVERLET
IS SIMPLY ANOTHER WORD--

43:46.024 --> 43:47.993
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK OF IT
AS A BEDSPREAD.

43:48.026 --> 43:49.861
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE
A LARGE COVERLET

43:49.895 --> 43:52.030
WITH ONE STANDARD SHAM
FOR THE TWIN,

43:52.063 --> 43:54.165
TWO STANDARD FOR THE FULL,
TWO STANDARD FOR THE QUEEN,

43:54.199 --> 43:56.768
AND TWO KING-SIZED
FOR THE KING,

43:56.802 --> 43:59.004
AND IT'S GOING TO BE IN YOUR
CHOICE OF DIFFERENT FAUX FURS.

43:59.037 --> 44:01.139
THIS IS THE LYNX...
[doorbell rings]

44:01.172 --> 44:02.908
- EM!

44:02.941 --> 44:05.076
- WHICH IS KIND OF A SOFTER,
LIGHTER ANIMAL PRINT,

44:05.110 --> 44:06.344
IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT
THAT WAY.

44:06.377 --> 44:07.813
[knock at door]

44:07.846 --> 44:10.782
- FUCK.

44:13.952 --> 44:19.925
[indistinct chatter from TV]

44:19.958 --> 44:22.093
- HEY, CARL.
- YOU BUSY?

44:22.127 --> 44:24.462
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU'VE JUST SAVED ME

44:24.495 --> 44:27.899
FROM BUYING A FAUX ZEBRA RUG
OFF THE SHOPPING CHANNEL.

44:27.933 --> 44:31.236
- [laughs]
UM, CAN I COME IN?

44:31.269 --> 44:34.172
- I'M REALLY NOT UP TO...

44:34.205 --> 44:36.041
I LOOK LIKE SHIT.

44:36.074 --> 44:40.445
- HEY, I'VE SEEN YOU FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING, REMEMBER?

44:40.478 --> 44:43.248
- YEAH.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.187
- IT MUST'VE BEEN A SHOCK,

44:49.220 --> 44:52.924
LOSING HIM LIKE THAT,
SO UNEXPECTED.

44:52.958 --> 44:55.193
- YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

44:55.226 --> 44:58.163
- SO MUCH LEFT UNSAID.

45:00.098 --> 45:03.068
- YEAH, THAT TOO.

45:03.101 --> 45:05.971
- I UNDERSTAND.

45:08.840 --> 45:12.377
- I WAS A FUCKING ASSHOLE,
CARL.

45:12.410 --> 45:15.346
I SAID HORRIBLE THINGS...

45:15.380 --> 45:18.349
THINGS I CAN NEVER
TAKE BACK,

45:18.383 --> 45:22.320
THINGS I CAN NEVER
BE FORGIVEN FOR.

45:23.855 --> 45:27.759
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE?

45:29.795 --> 45:35.100
- WHEN, UH--WHEN CELIA,
MY WIFE, DIED...

45:35.133 --> 45:37.769
SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
FOR THREE MONTHS,

45:37.803 --> 45:39.437
LINGERING, SUFFERING.

45:39.470 --> 45:40.839
LUNG CANCER.

45:40.872 --> 45:42.974
- I'M SORRY.

45:43.008 --> 45:47.045
- SHE WAS SO SCARED
TO DIE ALONE.

45:47.078 --> 45:52.117
S-SHE MADE ME PROMISE
I WOULDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

45:52.150 --> 45:56.554
SO I STAYED WITH HER,
DAY AND NIGHT.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.555
[sighs]

45:57.588 --> 45:59.457
SLEPT IN THAT GODDAMN CHAIR

45:59.490 --> 46:01.392
IN THAT
GODDAMN HOSPITAL ROOM,

46:01.426 --> 46:05.931
LISTENING TO HER
GASPING FOR BREATH.

46:05.964 --> 46:08.867
- [sighs]
ONE NIGHT, I WAS SO ANGRY--

46:08.900 --> 46:11.536
AT THE CHAIR, AT THE HOSPITAL,
AT THE DOCTORS,

46:11.569 --> 46:14.339
AT HER FOR SMOKING--

46:14.372 --> 46:18.877
I WENT OUT
AND I HAD A DRINK.

46:18.910 --> 46:23.849
ACTUALLY I, UH--
I HAD SO MANY, I LOST COUNT.

46:25.350 --> 46:30.055
WHEN I GOT BACK,
SHE WAS DEAD.

46:30.088 --> 46:34.792
MY WIFE DIED WHEN I
WAS OUT GETTING SLOSHED.

46:36.494 --> 46:39.097
[scoffs]

46:39.130 --> 46:44.502
I BROKE MY PROMISE,
AND MY CELIA DIED ALONE.

46:46.204 --> 46:50.842
AND I BEAT MYSELF UP
FOR A LONG TIME, DEBBIE...

46:50.876 --> 46:55.046
THINKING SHE'D
NEVER FORGIVE ME.

46:55.080 --> 47:00.118
BUT IT WAS ME
WHO WOULDN'T FORGIVE ME.

47:00.151 --> 47:02.253
SHE KNEW HOW MUCH
I LOVED HER.

47:02.287 --> 47:04.923
IF SHE WAS STILL HERE,
SHE'D SAY,

47:04.956 --> 47:07.926
"CARL, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

47:07.959 --> 47:11.362
ENOUGH ALREADY."

47:11.396 --> 47:16.101
IT'S THE SAME THING
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

47:16.134 --> 47:21.106
HE KNEW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVED HIM.

47:24.375 --> 47:27.979
- [sniffling]

47:28.013 --> 47:31.616
I'LL JUST NEVER BE ABLE
TO TELL HIM THAT I'M--

47:31.649 --> 47:34.886
THAT I'M SO SORRY.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.422
I'M JUST SO SORRY.
I CAN'T--

47:37.455 --> 47:40.491
- HE KNOWS, SWEETHEART.

47:40.525 --> 47:45.463
- [sobbing]

47:54.005 --> 47:57.042
[dinnerware clinking]

47:57.075 --> 47:58.910
- DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

47:58.944 --> 48:01.980
WHY DON'T YOU SET THE TABLE?

48:02.013 --> 48:04.549
- FOR TWO OR THREE?

48:04.582 --> 48:06.517
- THREE.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.320
- THEN MICHAEL'S
COMING BACK?

48:09.354 --> 48:11.589
- OF COURSE
HE'S COMING BACK.

48:11.622 --> 48:15.560
- I HEARD YOU GUYS FIGHTING
LAST NIGHT.

48:19.297 --> 48:20.665
- WE WEREN'T FIGHTING.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.533
WE WERE HAVING
A DISAGREEMENT.

48:22.567 --> 48:25.536
- YOU WERE DISAGREEING
REALLY LOUD.

48:25.570 --> 48:30.075
- SOMETIMES COUPLES DO THAT.

48:30.108 --> 48:32.077
ANYWAY, IT, UH,
DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

48:32.110 --> 48:35.013
- THE FUCK IT DOESN'T.

48:35.046 --> 48:37.148
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
IF YOU GUYS BREAK UP?

48:37.182 --> 48:39.317
- NOBODY'S BREAKING UP.

48:39.350 --> 48:42.287
- JUST ASKING, IN CASE I NEED
TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

48:42.320 --> 48:47.092

RIGHT HERE, PAL, WITH US.

49:05.410 --> 49:07.212

49:07.245 --> 49:10.048

49:10.081 --> 49:14.419
BY THE WAY...

[DVDs clatter]

50:37.168 --> 50:38.536
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

50:38.569 --> 50:41.206
- MAYBE BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.

50:41.239 --> 50:43.141
OR...

50:43.174 --> 50:46.577
MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

50:46.611 --> 50:48.713
- BRIAN, I'M YOUR PARTNER.

50:48.746 --> 50:50.315
- NOT ANYMORE.
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

50:50.348 --> 50:52.150
