00:00.835 --> 00:02.294
[instrumental music]

00:19.311 --> 00:21.229
[music continues]

00:24.733 --> 00:26.861
[sighs]

00:26.902 --> 00:29.655
- Founder's day punch?

00:26.902 --> 00:29.655
- Abba Zabbas.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.324
Good morning, Vietnam!

00:32.366 --> 00:33.701
- How's everyone feeling today?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.701
- Oh!

00:33.742 --> 00:35.744
- Not so good.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.744
- Terrific, okay.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.789
I got tacos, hard tacos,

00:35.786 --> 00:38.789
I got soft tacos.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.792
I got fries, curly,

00:38.831 --> 00:41.792
straight, and spicy.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.544
- Are you serious?

00:41.834 --> 00:43.544
- Trust me.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.295
This is the<i> best</i> hangover food

00:43.585 --> 00:45.295
on the east coast.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.506
You got a Mars bar?

00:45.337 --> 00:47.506
You know, hair of the dog?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.550
Ah, there's pop tarts

00:47.548 --> 00:49.550
in the cabinet, Kirk.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.759
Coffee will be up

00:49.591 --> 00:50.759
in a minute.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.302
Grab some water

00:50.801 --> 00:52.302
and start hydrating.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.137
The smell of these tacos

00:52.344 --> 00:54.137
is making me nauseous.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.931
No, no, no,

00:54.179 --> 00:55.931
that's the quart of Patty's

00:55.973 --> 00:58.308
non-FDA-approved Founder's day

00:55.973 --> 00:58.308
punch, you drank last night.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.895
- Eat a taco.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.895
- Oh, thank God! Hangover food.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.646
That's my little

01:00.936 --> 01:02.646
college girl.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.273
- Tito's was open this early?

01:02.688 --> 01:05.273
- Well, it was for me.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.109
The power you have over

01:05.315 --> 01:08.109
fast-food owners is astonishing.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.862
- Hmm.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.862
- Oh, God!

01:09.904 --> 01:12.072
I think, I'm gonna throw up.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.491
No, I'm good.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.576
By the way,

01:14.533 --> 01:15.576
thanks for leaving me on

01:15.617 --> 01:16.702
the bathroom floor all night.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.203
Uh, hey, I tried

01:16.744 --> 01:18.203
to get you up.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.454
You actually used

01:18.245 --> 01:19.454
your foot to stop me.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.915
- I did?

01:19.496 --> 01:20.915
- 'Yes.'

01:20.956 --> 01:21.957
It was very

01:20.956 --> 01:21.957
"House of Flying Daggers"

01:21.999 --> 01:23.124
but with vomiting.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.084
Sorry. I don't remember that.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.128
The foot part.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.128
The vomiting part, however--

01:27.170 --> 01:28.756
Stop saying the word

01:27.170 --> 01:28.756
"vomiting" unless you want

01:28.797 --> 01:30.966
a Mr. Creosote situation

01:28.797 --> 01:30.966
on you hands here.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.385
Hey.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.683
Oh, man,

01:37.180 --> 01:39.683
I think I got a cavity.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.727
I gotta stop

01:39.725 --> 01:41.727
partying like this.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.314
- What are you looking for?

01:44.730 --> 01:46.314
- My book bag.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.149
- I believe it's in your room.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.149
- Room?

01:48.191 --> 01:49.651
- It's that way.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.651
- Right.

01:49.693 --> 01:50.736
Hey.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.906
I got you a beef burrito.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.866
I thought it might be

01:53.948 --> 01:55.866
too hard-core

01:55.908 --> 01:56.992
for the amateurs

01:55.908 --> 01:56.992
in the kitchen

01:57.034 --> 01:58.159
but I figured

01:57.034 --> 01:58.159
you'd appreciate it.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.495
Thanks.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.664
- So, how are you feeling?

02:00.537 --> 02:02.664
- I've been better.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.291
- Yeah, you take Aspirin?

02:02.706 --> 02:04.291
- Aspirin?

02:04.332 --> 02:07.252
- White pill. Big "A" on it.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.252
- Right, yep.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.378
Oh, here, before I forget

02:08.420 --> 02:09.755
um, this fell out

02:08.420 --> 02:09.755
of your pocket

02:09.797 --> 02:11.590
last night while you were

02:09.797 --> 02:11.590
pulling an exorcist.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.134
Um, Paris gave it to me to hold

02:11.632 --> 02:14.134
so she wouldn't call Doyle.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.719
She was the talk

02:14.175 --> 02:15.719
of the town this morning.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.179
Attacked the pretzel cart,

02:15.761 --> 02:18.179
police backup had to be called

02:18.221 --> 02:19.431
for the first time<i> ever.</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:21.141
- She was quite a mess.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.141
- Ha-ha.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.726
So, apparently, it was a theme.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.228
I'm sorry. It won't happen

02:22.768 --> 02:25.228
again. Believe me.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.438
<i>You</i> of all people should know

02:26.480 --> 02:27.856
the dangers of

02:26.480 --> 02:27.856
Founder's day punch.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.483
Did you learn nothing from

02:27.898 --> 02:29.483
mommy's "coyote ugly"

02:29.524 --> 02:31.526
bar dance at last year's "salute

02:29.524 --> 02:31.526
to the quakers" festival?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.612
Oh, now, you can't blame

02:31.568 --> 02:33.612
that all on the punch.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.196
Well, don't get me wrong,

02:33.654 --> 02:35.196
I'm always up for a little

02:35.238 --> 02:37.198
mother-daughter bonding,

02:35.238 --> 02:37.198
but seriously..

02:37.240 --> 02:38.366
when did facials

02:37.240 --> 02:38.366
go out of style?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.701
I'm sorry.

02:39.743 --> 02:40.911
I just don't like

02:39.743 --> 02:40.911
seeing you like that.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.413
That makes two of us.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.915
So, what was all that stuff

02:44.957 --> 02:46.083
you were babbling on

02:44.957 --> 02:46.083
about last night?

02:46.125 --> 02:48.002
- What stuff?

02:46.125 --> 02:48.002
- About Logan.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.504
Things aren't going so well

02:48.043 --> 02:50.504
with the two of you, huh?

02:50.545 --> 02:53.381
- I'm gonna get some coffee.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.381
- Rory.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.926
I know. Kitchen, that way.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.127
Ah, sure. You wanna sit down?

04:12.169 --> 04:16.757
Nope. Got to

04:12.169 --> 04:16.757
stay vertical. What?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.884
You have like an octagon

04:16.798 --> 04:18.884
imprint on your face.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.844
I can't do this anymore, Logan.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.388
- Do what?

04:20.886 --> 04:23.388
- This casual-dating thing.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.723
I don't like it,

04:23.430 --> 04:24.723
it's not who I am.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.266
And I don't wanna

04:24.765 --> 04:26.266
make it who I'm.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.185
Whoa, hold on here.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.185
Where's this coming from?

04:28.227 --> 04:29.228
It's coming from me.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.270
The ravishing creature

04:30.311 --> 04:31.980
standing in front of you.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.899
- We talked about this.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.899
- I know.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.650
- I didn't make you do this.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.650
- I know.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.528
I'm not accusing you of

04:35.692 --> 04:38.528
anything. This isn't your fault.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.447
I don't understand. I thought

04:38.570 --> 04:40.447
everything was going so well.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.323
What are you talking about? I

04:40.488 --> 04:42.323
didn't hear from you in a week.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.118
I was busy.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.118
I had some friends in town--

04:44.159 --> 04:46.161
You know what? It doesn't

04:44.159 --> 04:46.161
matter. You're not my boyfriend.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.621
You don't owe me

04:46.203 --> 04:47.621
any explanations.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.124
I just don't wanna be

04:47.662 --> 04:50.124
one of the many anymore.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.500
Oh, Rory, come on.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.086
Hey, Logan,

04:52.542 --> 04:54.086
Cassandra's on the phone.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.004
- Take a message.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.004
- She's got a great accent.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.965
- Where's she from?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.965
- Lanny, message!

04:58.006 --> 05:00.968
Fine, relax, man. Jeez.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.552
Go call Cassandra back.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.552
We're done here.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.971
How are we done here?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.680
I said everything I have to say.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.182
Which is what?

05:07.224 --> 05:09.601
I'm a "girlfriend" girl, Logan.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.601
I have boyfriends.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.603
- 'Not escorts.'

05:09.643 --> 05:11.603
- Ah.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.648
'I thought I could be different,

05:11.645 --> 05:14.648
but I can't. I'm sorry.'

05:14.689 --> 05:16.524
Maybe we can just go

05:14.689 --> 05:16.524
back to being friends again.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.277
Or maybe we can become

05:16.566 --> 05:18.277
boyfriend and girlfriend, right?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.112
- What?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.112
- I get it.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.863
- I get what you're doing.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.863
- I'm not<i> doing</i> anything.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.282
Hey, if that's what you want

05:21.905 --> 05:23.282
then just come out

05:23.323 --> 05:24.532
and say it okay,

05:23.323 --> 05:24.532
but you comin' in here

05:24.574 --> 05:25.617
and issuing an ultimatum?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.368
I am not issuing an ultimatum.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.412
- That's not what I heard.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.412
- I said, "let's be friends."

05:29.454 --> 05:32.040
- That's not what you meant.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.040
- Oh, I need a taco.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.920
Alright. Fine. I'll do it.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.379
- Do what?

05:36.962 --> 05:38.379
- I'll be your boyfriend.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.465
- You can't be my boyfriend.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.465
- Why not?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.509
Because you told me that

05:40.507 --> 05:42.509
you can't be my boyfriend.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.094
If I say I can, then I can.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.929
You have a hundred girls

05:44.136 --> 05:45.929
on speed dial, you keep

05:45.971 --> 05:48.473
a second bathrobe in your closet

05:45.971 --> 05:48.473
for overnight guests.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.058
That's all beside the point,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.058
you came in here to say

05:50.100 --> 05:51.559
you were unhappy

05:50.100 --> 05:51.559
with the situation. Right?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.478
- Right.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.478
- I've rectified the situation.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.480
- Problem solved.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.480
- No, problem not solved.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.482
Hey, if I say I can

05:55.522 --> 05:57.482
do this, I can do this.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.859
[knock on door]

06:00.485 --> 06:02.321
Hey, Logan, I thought

06:00.485 --> 06:02.321
maybe I could

06:02.361 --> 06:03.488
get you to buy me some lunch.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.032
- 'Oh, jeez.'

06:03.530 --> 06:05.032
- I'm sorry.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.365
Could you excuse us

06:05.073 --> 06:06.365
for<i> just</i> a second?

06:06.407 --> 06:07.450
- We're almost done here.

06:06.407 --> 06:07.450
- 'Sure.'

06:07.492 --> 06:09.619
I'll just wait out here.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.208
So, the Swedish flight attendant

06:12.164 --> 06:14.208
should be here any minute.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.793
I swear this situation has never

06:14.249 --> 06:16.793
happened before in my life.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.170
- Logan--

06:16.835 --> 06:18.170
- Rory.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.587
Do you really wanna

06:18.212 --> 06:19.587
stop seeing me?

06:19.629 --> 06:20.839
No, but I can't--

06:20.881 --> 06:22.799
'Cause I don't wanna

06:20.881 --> 06:22.799
stop seeing<i> you.</i>

06:22.841 --> 06:23.967
Okay, but--

06:24.009 --> 06:26.261
So, then just accept

06:24.009 --> 06:26.261
what I'm saying.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.512
I like trying

06:26.303 --> 06:27.512
new things, it's new

06:27.554 --> 06:29.348
it's different,

06:27.554 --> 06:29.348
but I can do it.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.266
Are you sure?

06:34.561 --> 06:36.688
I know you can do<i> that,</i> but..

06:42.277 --> 06:44.279
- I really wanna believe you.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.279
- Then believe me.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.574
We're starting fresh

06:44.321 --> 06:47.574
right now, new beginning.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.616
So, you wanna go

06:47.615 --> 06:48.616
grab some lunch?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.493
We'll hammer out the details.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.246
I should probably

06:50.535 --> 06:52.246
change first.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.998
Go home, change. I'll pick

06:52.287 --> 06:54.998
you up in half an hour.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.166
Okay.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.295
See how good

06:58.835 --> 07:00.295
this is going so far?

07:00.337 --> 07:01.546
I think I'm gonna be

07:00.337 --> 07:01.546
an excellent boyfriend.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.173
I agree, now,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.173
do you wanna go tell her?

07:03.215 --> 07:04.383
- Or should I?

07:03.215 --> 07:04.383
- Oh, crap.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.425
I'll be right back.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.387
[instrumental music]

07:20.774 --> 07:23.068
- Doyle?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.068
- Hey.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.613
- What are you doing here?

07:23.110 --> 07:26.613
- I'm dying.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.073
What do you mean

07:26.654 --> 07:28.073
you're dying?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.409
I got sick and then my very

07:30.450 --> 07:31.993
concerned roommates

07:30.450 --> 07:31.993
kicked me out.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.954
- Because they have exams.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.954
- Oh, my God!

07:33.995 --> 07:36.081
'I didn't know where to go

07:33.995 --> 07:36.081
so I came here.'

07:36.123 --> 07:38.166
- I called you first.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.166
- I was gone this weekend.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.585
So I just came by,

07:38.208 --> 07:40.585
I thought I'd wait

07:40.627 --> 07:42.462
till you got back

07:40.627 --> 07:42.462
then I fell asleep.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.631
- You've been here all weekend?

07:42.503 --> 07:44.631
- Uh-huh.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.049
'I thought

07:44.672 --> 07:46.049
you were avoiding me.'

07:46.091 --> 07:48.009
[coughing]

07:49.303 --> 07:50.511
I'm sorry you're sick.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.181
Feels like bees

07:50.553 --> 07:53.181
are buzzing in my head.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.308
- Feel it.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.308
- What?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.976
- 'Feel my head.'

07:54.349 --> 07:55.976
- Why?

07:56.017 --> 07:57.644
I just want you to know

07:56.017 --> 07:57.644
how hot I am.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.396
Well, when you're hot,

07:57.685 --> 07:59.396
you're hot.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.939
When you're not, you're not.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.939
That's how the song goes.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.649
Just follow the song.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.775
I just don't see

08:02.690 --> 08:03.775
what putting my hand

08:03.817 --> 08:05.110
on your head

08:03.817 --> 08:05.110
is going to get you.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.236
- I just--

08:05.152 --> 08:06.236
- I'm not a shaman, Doyle.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.737
I don't have healing powers.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.573
- Where are you going?

08:07.779 --> 08:10.573
- I'll be right back.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.118
Now, hold on a second.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.118
It's for you.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.203
It's Sookie. She's done

08:13.160 --> 08:15.203
with her doctor's appointment.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.330
Oh, did she say how she is?

08:16.371 --> 08:17.622
Hm, to someone

08:16.371 --> 08:17.622
who may've asked her

08:17.664 --> 08:18.665
I'm sure she would have.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.000
Um-hmm. Hey, Sookie.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.501
The bastard put me on bed rest.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.794
- 'What?'

08:21.542 --> 08:22.794
- Yeah, Dr. Mank.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.504
He told me

08:22.836 --> 08:24.504
to lie down immediately

08:24.545 --> 08:25.922
and not to get up again until

08:25.964 --> 08:27.715
little cherry

08:25.964 --> 08:27.715
or norret comes out.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.051
Oh, we'll get

08:27.757 --> 08:30.051
to the names in a second.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.679
So, are you serious about

08:30.093 --> 08:32.679
the bed rest? W-where are you?

08:32.720 --> 08:34.848
- I'm at home, on the couch.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.848
- Are you okay?

08:34.889 --> 08:36.724
No. I'm not okay.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.724
I have a dinner to get out.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.102
Well, honey, I think we're gonna

08:36.766 --> 08:39.102
have to do that without you.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.062
- 'But how?'

08:39.144 --> 08:41.062
- Well, we have a kitchen staff.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.605
And you just tell me

08:41.104 --> 08:42.605
what still needs to be done

08:42.647 --> 08:43.940
and we will handle it.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.526
- Okay. Get a pencil.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.526
- Okay, pencil in hand.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.611
You need to grate

08:46.567 --> 08:48.611
six carrots and four parsnips

08:48.653 --> 08:50.571
'and then take some flour

08:48.653 --> 08:50.571
and butter. Melt the butter.'

08:50.613 --> 08:53.074
- 'Make a roux.'

08:50.613 --> 08:53.074
- Ah, w-whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.659
- 'What?'

08:53.116 --> 08:54.659
- Uh, baby.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.577
You lost me at "carrots"

08:54.701 --> 08:56.577
which by the way

08:56.619 --> 08:58.163
was the first draft

08:56.619 --> 08:58.163
of "you had me at hello."

08:58.205 --> 08:59.998
"You had me at," what-what

08:58.205 --> 08:59.998
are you talking about?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.334
Oh, sorry. I see, we've entered

09:00.040 --> 09:02.334
the "No humor" zone.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.878
Um, look. Just relax. I'm

09:02.376 --> 09:04.878
gonna take care of everything.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.587
- The ducks!

09:04.919 --> 09:06.587
- The ducks will be fine.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.256
They're lying in a pan

09:06.629 --> 09:08.256
with their heads chopped off.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.675
So, the worst part is behind

09:08.298 --> 09:10.675
them. Now, don't worry.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.719
Go rest, and I'll check in

09:10.717 --> 09:12.719
with you later.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.262
- But--

09:12.760 --> 09:14.262
- 'Happy hibernating.'

09:14.304 --> 09:15.555
[telephone beeps]

09:15.596 --> 09:17.974
- No Sookie?

09:15.596 --> 09:17.974
- No Sookie. Come on.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.768
Okay, now, tell me

09:19.393 --> 09:20.768
who does what

09:20.810 --> 09:22.229
and what we need

09:20.810 --> 09:22.229
to keep things running.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.105
- Too bad. We need Sookie here.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.105
- Okay, well..

09:24.147 --> 09:25.732
She's not gonna be here,

09:24.147 --> 09:25.732
so let's go to plan "B."

09:25.773 --> 09:27.275
Okay, plan "B," that involves

09:27.317 --> 09:29.152
Sookie's clone

09:27.317 --> 09:29.152
also named "Sookie."

09:29.194 --> 09:31.363
Well, um, who here

09:29.194 --> 09:31.363
makes the sauces?

09:31.405 --> 09:33.490
- Sookie.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.490
- Who<i> here,</i> Michel?

09:33.532 --> 09:34.908
Sookie trusts no one else

09:33.532 --> 09:34.908
with the sauces.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.493
She makes the sauces.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.328
- Well, what does Mark make?

09:36.535 --> 09:38.328
- Salads.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.497
Okay, and Donny does desserts.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.497
What do our other guys do?

09:40.539 --> 09:42.665
Well, that man over there

09:40.539 --> 09:42.665
does the cleaning.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.709
That man over there

09:42.707 --> 09:44.709
dresses the plates.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.504
That man uses tongs and..

09:47.546 --> 09:49.464
I have no idea what

09:47.546 --> 09:49.464
that man in the corner does

09:49.506 --> 09:51.383
but I would check

09:49.506 --> 09:51.383
his trunk before he leaves.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.510
Without Sookie here

09:51.425 --> 09:53.510
we have salads and desserts?

09:53.552 --> 09:54.886
- Pretty much.

09:53.552 --> 09:54.886
- Ah!

09:54.928 --> 09:55.929
We can't run

09:54.928 --> 09:55.929
a restaurant serving

09:55.970 --> 09:57.138
just salads and desserts.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.723
I would not go to eat, no.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.058
Wait. Okay, here we have duck.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.476
Um, who here does the duck?

10:01.518 --> 10:03.811
<i>Nobody</i> touches the ducks.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.565
Well, uh, starting now,

10:03.853 --> 10:06.565
someone has to touch the ducks.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.192
I do not know what to tell you,

10:06.606 --> 10:09.192
except it will not be me.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.279
- Oh, this is bad, Michel.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.279
- I'm getting that, yes, so?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.322
Well, we'll just figure

10:12.320 --> 10:14.322
something out, right?

10:14.364 --> 10:18.201
Absolutely.

10:14.364 --> 10:18.201
Ain't no mountain high enough.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.371
Just, um, formulate a plan,

10:18.243 --> 10:21.371
nail down a strategy.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.705
Uh, you have any ideas?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.249
Now, we could order some pizza

10:24.291 --> 10:26.251
or Chinese food or perhaps

10:26.293 --> 10:28.336
one of those hoagies that

10:26.293 --> 10:28.336
you cut into a million pieces.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.255
No more suggestions

10:28.378 --> 10:30.255
necessary, Michel.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.673
Well, I'm here if you need me.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.553
[telephone rings]

10:36.595 --> 10:38.138
- Luke's.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.138
- How pretty do you think I am?

10:38.179 --> 10:40.140
Are we using a specific day?

10:40.181 --> 10:41.516
Have you had

10:40.181 --> 10:41.516
a good night's sleep?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.059
Sookie's doctor put her

10:41.558 --> 10:43.059
on immediate bed rest

10:43.101 --> 10:44.603
and I thought it

10:43.101 --> 10:44.603
would be fine but no one

10:44.644 --> 10:46.104
will touch the ducks

10:44.644 --> 10:46.104
and Michel wants to order

10:46.146 --> 10:48.022
a hoagie and I am starting

10:46.146 --> 10:48.022
to hyperventilate

10:48.064 --> 10:49.107
'and I'm not wearing

10:48.064 --> 10:49.107
stretchy fabric.'

10:49.149 --> 10:51.067
I'll be right there.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.236
- How's that headache of yours?

10:51.109 --> 10:53.236
- Subsiding a little.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.613
The mashed potato,

10:53.278 --> 10:54.613
mac and cheese

10:54.654 --> 10:56.406
biscuit gravy plate

10:54.654 --> 10:56.406
combo really helped a lot.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.991
I have to say half

10:56.448 --> 10:57.991
the fun of being with you

10:58.032 --> 10:59.993
is the horrified looks

10:58.032 --> 10:59.993
on the waiters' faces.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.078
Um, please, I'm an amateur

11:00.034 --> 11:02.078
compared to my mother.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.288
So, what do you think,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.288
you up for a movie?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.956
Oh, yeah,

11:03.330 --> 11:04.956
something really bad.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.374
Absolutely, let's check

11:04.998 --> 11:06.374
the paper and see if

11:06.416 --> 11:08.376
Rob Schneider is

11:06.416 --> 11:08.376
still employable.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.794
I think I have

11:08.418 --> 11:09.794
a paper over here.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.087
(Honor)

11:09.836 --> 11:11.087
'Well, look how long you make'

11:11.129 --> 11:12.422
'a girl wait for you.'

11:12.464 --> 11:14.048
- Honor!

11:12.464 --> 11:14.048
- You think you're worth it?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.467
What are you doing here?

11:15.509 --> 11:17.135
Apparently, begging

11:15.509 --> 11:17.135
for some affection.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.761
Ah!

11:18.803 --> 11:21.264
- 'It is<i> so</i> good to see you.'

11:18.803 --> 11:21.264
- 'You too.'

11:21.306 --> 11:23.266
Listen, Logan,

11:21.306 --> 11:23.266
maybe I should go.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.143
What? Oh, sorry, God!

11:25.185 --> 11:26.436
Rory, this is

11:25.185 --> 11:26.436
my sister, Honor.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.105
- 'Honor, Rory Gilmore.'

11:26.478 --> 11:29.105
- Sister? Really?

11:29.147 --> 11:30.773
Oh, well, it's nice to meet you.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.360
- It's nice to meet you too.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.360
- Hey, your sister's here. Cool.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.195
- So, what's the occasion?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.195
- Well, I had to see you.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.863
And since, you never

11:35.236 --> 11:36.863
check your e-mail

11:36.904 --> 11:39.491
I had to drag myself down

11:36.904 --> 11:39.491
and beg Lanny to let me in

11:39.533 --> 11:41.159
so I could show you this!

11:41.201 --> 11:44.120
- Holy!

11:41.201 --> 11:44.120
- It happened last night.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.289
- Oh, Josh finally gave in, huh?

11:44.162 --> 11:46.289
- Oh, stop it.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.999
He's lucky I ever looked

11:46.331 --> 11:47.999
at him in the first place.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.545
- Well, congratulations.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.545
- Listen, I need a favor.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.254
I'm going to tell<i> them</i>

11:51.586 --> 11:53.254
tomorrow night at dinner

11:53.296 --> 11:54.631
and I need you there

11:53.296 --> 11:54.631
for support.

11:54.673 --> 11:55.798
- Come on.

11:54.673 --> 11:55.798
- Hey.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.008
'I backed you up

11:55.840 --> 11:57.008
when you wanted'

11:57.050 --> 11:58.051
'to take a year off

11:57.050 --> 11:58.051
of school'

11:58.092 --> 11:59.386
'and sail around the world.'

11:59.427 --> 12:00.803
'I wired you the money

11:59.427 --> 12:00.803
when you sunk'

12:00.845 --> 12:01.888
the yacht,<i> I</i> helped pay off

12:01.929 --> 12:03.056
the Indonesian coast guard.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.558
Okay, okay, I give.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.558
I'll be there.

12:04.599 --> 12:05.684
Oh, thank you! I love you.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.561
I love you, I love you!

12:07.602 --> 12:11.565
Okay, now I can breathe

12:07.602 --> 12:11.565
and focus on you.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.233
- 'Hi.'

12:11.606 --> 12:13.233
- Hi.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.235
I'm sorry, I'm totally

12:13.274 --> 12:15.235
blanking. Your name is?

12:15.276 --> 12:16.486
Rory. Rory Gilmore.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.737
Yeah, Rory's my..

12:18.779 --> 12:19.947
...girlfriend.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.826
You okay over there?

12:23.868 --> 12:27.372
You need a little water

12:23.868 --> 12:27.372
or a...time machine?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.499
I'm sorry.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.499
Did you say "girlfriend?"

12:29.541 --> 12:30.667
- Yes.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.667
- It's new.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.544
Oh, my God!

12:32.586 --> 12:35.296
I've never heard him call

12:32.586 --> 12:35.296
anyone his girlfriend before.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.964
Well, Alyssa Milano,

12:35.338 --> 12:36.964
but he was ten

12:37.006 --> 12:38.425
and in a weird

12:37.006 --> 12:38.425
"who's the boss?" phase.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.009
Oh, wow, time flies when you're

12:40.051 --> 12:41.052
getting pushed out the door.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.095
Okay, I'm sorry. Listen.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.513
You must come to dinner too.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.599
- Oh, um--

12:43.555 --> 12:45.599
- No, really. Come.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.059
Please, come. It'll make it

12:45.640 --> 12:48.059
more festive and distracting.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.478
- We'll see.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.478
- Okay, fine.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.689
I have to go.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.689
I'll see you tomorrow night.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.982
- Please don't be late.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.982
- I promise.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.110
- Oh.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.110
- Bye, Rory.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.194
Bye.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.780
- And that is my sister.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.780
- I like her.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.533
- Yeah, she's cool.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.533
- Listen.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.243
You do not have to

13:03.575 --> 13:05.243
take me to dinner tomorrow.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.911
It's a family thing.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.911
I totally understand.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.413
- No, you should come.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.413
- Logan.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.956
Hey, boyfriends bring

13:08.455 --> 13:09.956
their girlfriends

13:09.997 --> 13:12.250
to their family's houses

13:09.997 --> 13:12.250
for dinner. It's natural.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.128
- How would you know?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.128
- I saw it on "Who's The Boss?"

13:15.169 --> 13:17.380
Now, let's find that paper.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.596
So, there's the fridge. Stove's

13:22.302 --> 13:24.596
over there. Grills on the side.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.014
Freezer's in the back, that's

13:24.638 --> 13:27.014
salad man, plate man, tongs guy

13:27.056 --> 13:29.225
check-his-trunk before-he-leaves

13:27.056 --> 13:29.225
guy and here are the ducks.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.935
- Are you familiar with ducks?

13:29.267 --> 13:30.935
- I am familiar with ducks.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.811
Well, I mean, not just familiar

13:30.977 --> 13:32.811
like "you know what a duck is."

13:32.853 --> 13:33.896
I mean have you cooked

13:32.853 --> 13:33.896
a duck before?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.189
I can handle the ducks. Relax.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.483
Okay, ducks handled, good.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.693
Now, does Sookie

13:36.524 --> 13:38.693
have a menu, notes, or..

13:38.735 --> 13:40.737
- Oh!

13:38.735 --> 13:40.737
- Uh, thanks, uh..

13:40.779 --> 13:42.614
- Me<i> llamo Manny.</i>

13:40.779 --> 13:42.614
- Manny.<i> Gracias,</i> Manny.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.282
I talked to Sookie, she said

13:42.656 --> 13:44.282
everything you need to know

13:44.324 --> 13:45.866
is in that folder.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.866
It's a little unorganized.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.993
Well, it wouldn't be

13:45.908 --> 13:46.993
Sookie's folder if it wasn't

13:47.034 --> 13:48.202
a<i> little</i> unorganized.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.704
Okay, so, uh,

13:48.244 --> 13:49.704
what can I do to help?

13:49.746 --> 13:51.790
- Nothing.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.790
- Oh, perfect answer.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.333
Uh, not without a hairnet.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.833
Okay, I'll be out there

13:53.374 --> 13:54.833
if you need me.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.710
Okay.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.297
- He's right there.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.297
- What's going on?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.716
- I'm taking care of you.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.716
- You're wha..

14:01.758 --> 14:03.926
- Hey! Hey!

14:01.758 --> 14:03.926
- This is Nanny.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.011
She only speaks Portuguese.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.429
Wha-what's Portuguese for

14:06.471 --> 14:08.431
"ow, you're ripping

14:06.471 --> 14:08.431
my chest hair out"?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.141
<i>Pega uma camiseta</i>

14:08.473 --> 14:10.141
<i>limpa para ese menino.</i>

14:10.183 --> 14:12.477
- Clean shirt. Got it.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.477
- What's she doing?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.936
What's that jar?

14:13.978 --> 14:17.524
She's got salve!

14:13.978 --> 14:17.524
She's got salve! Ugh!

14:17.565 --> 14:19.150
Doyle, relax.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.150
Nanny took care of me for years.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.610
'Oh, God!'

14:20.652 --> 14:21.820
Do you remember when Han Solo

14:21.861 --> 14:23.530
finds Luke Skywalker

14:21.861 --> 14:23.530
in the snowstorm

14:23.571 --> 14:26.199
and he cuts open their

14:23.571 --> 14:26.199
dead Tauntaun to hide inside?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.950
That's what I smell like

14:26.240 --> 14:27.950
at this moment.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.910
She makes that balm herself.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.910
I'm telling you it's magic.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.412
Paris, no offense

14:29.952 --> 14:31.412
to Nanny and her

14:31.454 --> 14:33.748
magic healing balm

14:31.454 --> 14:33.748
but when I came over here

14:33.790 --> 14:35.333
I thought<i> you</i> would

14:33.790 --> 14:35.333
take care of me.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.001
I<i> am</i> taking care of you.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.001
I brought you Nanny.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.753
I don't want Nanny.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.753
I'm scared of Nanny.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.171
I-can't you take it from here?

14:40.213 --> 14:41.715
- No.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.715
- 'Why?'

14:41.756 --> 14:44.008
- Sick people freak me out.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.008
- You're pre-med!

14:44.050 --> 14:45.885
<i>Fica cochilo.</i>

14:44.050 --> 14:45.885
<i>Vou fazer mais sopa.</i>

14:45.926 --> 14:47.261
- Paris.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.261
- 'Lie down.'

14:47.303 --> 14:49.096
'You'll feel better

14:47.303 --> 14:49.096
soon. I promise.'

14:51.683 --> 14:52.975
[telephone rings]

14:53.017 --> 14:54.352
<i>Cocina.</i>

14:54.394 --> 14:55.478
<i>Sí, aquí está.</i>

14:55.520 --> 14:58.523
- Luke, Sookie.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.523
- Hey, Sookie.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.107
- Hi.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.107
- 'Hi.'

15:00.149 --> 15:01.901
- Whatcha doin'?

15:00.149 --> 15:01.901
- I'm cooking.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.445
'Right, good.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.445
Little test.'

15:04.487 --> 15:08.115
So, I was just checking in,

15:04.487 --> 15:08.115
making sure everything was fine.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.784
Everything is fine.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.285
The ducks working out for you?

15:11.327 --> 15:12.829
Ducks are selling

15:11.327 --> 15:12.829
like hot cakes.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.373
Oh! Like hot cakes.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.878
God, you are a funny guy.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.878
I just, I never realized.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.463
'So, I just wanted

15:19.919 --> 15:22.463
to tell you that'

15:22.505 --> 15:25.091
'I'm really grateful to you

15:22.505 --> 15:25.091
for jumping in like this.'

15:25.132 --> 15:26.551
Happy to jump.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.177
- Are you straining the sauce?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.177
- Excuse me?

15:28.219 --> 15:29.554
'The duck sauce.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.554
Are you straining it?'

15:29.596 --> 15:30.680
- Yes.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.680
- Twice?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.432
- 'No.'

15:30.722 --> 15:32.432
- Oh. Well.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.392
It's really best

15:32.473 --> 15:34.392
if you strain it twice.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.894
It makes it really smooth.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.520
People seem to be

15:35.935 --> 15:37.520
liking the sauce, Sookie.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.313
Well, sure, when you don't know

15:39.355 --> 15:40.356
what you're missing, then--

15:40.398 --> 15:41.900
Okay, tell you what, from now on

15:41.941 --> 15:43.234
I will strain

15:41.941 --> 15:43.234
the duck sauce twice.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.736
Three times,

15:43.276 --> 15:44.736
if it'll make you happy.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.447
- No. Then it'll be too runny.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.447
- Twice it is.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.907
- Thank you.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.907
- 'You're welcome.'

15:48.948 --> 15:50.533
Hey, I got Sookie on the phone.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.118
- You need to talk to her?

15:50.575 --> 15:52.118
- Yes, actually, great.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.871
- I'm handing over to Lorelai.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.871
- Hey.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.290
He's not straining the duck

15:54.913 --> 15:57.290
sauce three times, is he?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.708
Oh, not to my knowledge.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.543
Hey, Sookie. Where are the

15:58.750 --> 16:00.543
applications?

16:00.585 --> 16:02.044
I don't know why he'd joke

16:00.585 --> 16:02.044
about a thing like that.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.546
Three times!

16:02.086 --> 16:03.546
That's not funny!

16:03.588 --> 16:05.089
Sookie, the applications from

16:05.131 --> 16:07.801
the culinary institute for your

16:05.131 --> 16:07.801
temporary replacement?

16:07.842 --> 16:09.969
- Are they not there?

16:07.842 --> 16:09.969
- Depends on where "there" is.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.388
[chuckles]

16:10.010 --> 16:12.388
They're around somewhere.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.015
Check the freezer. Sometimes

16:12.430 --> 16:15.015
I like to read in there.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.268
That's very Lucy of you.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.268
I'll call when I find them.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.687
- Now rest. Bye.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.687
- 'Bye.'

16:19.729 --> 16:21.940
You know, I love watching

16:19.729 --> 16:21.940
you cook. It's hot.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.274
It's because you're standing

16:22.022 --> 16:23.274
next to the broiler.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.651
Oh, is that what

16:23.316 --> 16:24.651
we're calling it now?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.235
Not in front

16:24.692 --> 16:26.235
of the guys, please.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.028
Fine, I'll save my dirty

16:26.277 --> 16:28.028
cooking jokes for later.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.907
Yeah, I was just wondering

16:29.656 --> 16:30.907
if I could get you

16:30.949 --> 16:33.367
to resubmit those applications.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.495
Well, we seem

16:33.409 --> 16:35.495
to have misplaced them.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.246
As soon as possible

16:35.536 --> 16:37.246
would be great.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.998
[door creaks]

16:39.039 --> 16:42.209
Uh-huh. Okay. You can just fax

16:39.039 --> 16:42.209
them over. Thanks. Bye.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.462
[cellphone beeps]

16:44.504 --> 16:46.673
Hello. Is somebody there?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.174
- Hey, mom!

16:46.714 --> 16:48.174
- Oh.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.676
"Hey, mom!" That's it?

16:49.717 --> 16:50.885
You just gave me a heart attack

16:50.927 --> 16:52.178
and all you have to say

16:50.927 --> 16:52.178
is "Hey, mom?"

16:52.219 --> 16:53.638
I thought you were

16:52.219 --> 16:53.638
a vicious serial killer.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.515
Who you were going to

16:53.680 --> 16:55.515
challenge to a pillow fight?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.016
What are you doing here,

16:55.556 --> 16:57.016
Sassy McSasserson?

16:57.057 --> 16:58.267
I needed some stuff.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.894
- What stuff?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.894
- My blue dress.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.312
Why do you need

16:59.936 --> 17:01.312
your blue dress for?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.857
Okay, I'm going to

17:01.354 --> 17:03.857
tell you something

17:03.898 --> 17:05.984
but when I do,

17:03.898 --> 17:05.984
you cannot say a word.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.735
- Why not?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.735
- Because I don't wanna hear it.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.236
- Hear what?

17:07.777 --> 17:09.236
- What you're gonna say.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.279
But how do you know

17:09.278 --> 17:10.279
what I'm gonna say?

17:10.321 --> 17:11.364
Trust me. I know.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.406
Hey, I've been known to say

17:12.448 --> 17:14.116
some very surprising things.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.743
"Hugh, I know

17:14.158 --> 17:15.743
you're with Elizabeth Hurley

17:15.785 --> 17:17.578
but how about picking up

17:15.785 --> 17:17.578
a hooker tonight?"

17:17.620 --> 17:18.663
- That was me.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.663
- Mom!

17:18.705 --> 17:20.498
Okay, fine.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.419
Logan and I are now

17:22.208 --> 17:25.419
boyfriend and girlfriend.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.631
And I'm here

17:25.461 --> 17:28.631
because I need my blue dress

17:28.673 --> 17:30.717
to wear to his

17:28.673 --> 17:30.717
parent's house tonight.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.764
[door creaks]

17:40.226 --> 17:42.061
I went over to Logan's

17:40.226 --> 17:42.061
apartment yesterday.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.731
I told him that I didn't wanna

17:42.102 --> 17:44.731
do the casual-dating thing

17:44.772 --> 17:46.065
anymore and that it

17:44.772 --> 17:46.065
wasn't me and we should

17:46.106 --> 17:47.191
just go back to being friends.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.401
Instead, he decided to commit.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.069
- Uh--

17:48.442 --> 17:50.069
- Not a word.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.364
Now, I know the things may have

17:50.110 --> 17:53.364
started off a little rocky.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.866
- Um--

17:53.406 --> 17:54.866
- Unh-unh-unh.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.117
But I am very happy

17:54.908 --> 17:57.117
with the way things are going

17:57.159 --> 18:00.038
and I think that in time,

17:57.159 --> 18:00.038
you will be too.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.873
Okay, I have everything

18:00.079 --> 18:01.873
I need. I have to get going.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.541
Logan's picking me up at 6.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.919
It was nice talking to you.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.919
Don't forget to breathe.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.423
[sighs]

18:10.464 --> 18:12.967
Um, good. Add the parsley.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.967
Get it out there.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.301
Kitchen.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.636
Do you put walnuts

18:14.343 --> 18:15.636
in your bechamel?

18:15.678 --> 18:16.971
Sookie?

18:17.013 --> 18:19.306
Do you put walnuts

18:17.013 --> 18:19.306
in your bechamel?

18:19.348 --> 18:20.349
No.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.392
You<i> don't</i> put walnuts

18:21.434 --> 18:22.643
in your bechamel.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.562
Sookie, I have

18:22.685 --> 18:24.562
things burning,--

18:24.604 --> 18:26.146
I thought

18:24.604 --> 18:26.146
I tasted walnuts.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.857
What things are you burning?

18:27.899 --> 18:29.817
What do you mean

18:27.899 --> 18:29.817
you tasted walnuts?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.070
If you wanna get fancy, you can

18:29.859 --> 18:32.070
do that at your own diner.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.738
My bechamel sauce is classic.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.073
How are you tasting

18:33.780 --> 18:35.073
the bechamel?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.908
'And I don't remember including'

18:36.950 --> 18:38.409
'goat cheese in

18:36.950 --> 18:38.409
the fennel salad.'

18:38.451 --> 18:39.911
How do you know

18:38.451 --> 18:39.911
what's in the fennel salad?

18:39.953 --> 18:41.662
So you admit it,

18:39.953 --> 18:41.662
you put goat cheese

18:41.704 --> 18:43.205
in the fennel salad.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.707
Yeah, it goes goat cheese

18:43.247 --> 18:44.707
in the fennel salad.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.833
It goes good in the fennel salad

18:45.875 --> 18:46.876
and you had it sitting there.

18:46.918 --> 18:47.961
And I also have some brillo pads

18:48.002 --> 18:49.503
sitting there, you wanna toss

18:49.545 --> 18:52.214
a couple of those into

18:49.545 --> 18:52.214
the fennel salad, as well? Hmm?

18:52.256 --> 18:55.093
- 'How do you know all this?'

18:52.256 --> 18:55.093
- I just assumed.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.177
You just assumed I put goat

18:55.134 --> 18:57.177
cheese in the fennel salad?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.721
And walnuts

18:57.219 --> 18:58.721
in the bechamel.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.933
I did not

18:58.763 --> 19:01.933
put walnuts in..

19:01.975 --> 19:04.143
Sookie, are you

19:01.975 --> 19:04.143
having people

19:04.184 --> 19:07.105
bring you my food?

19:04.184 --> 19:07.105
'You are!'

19:07.146 --> 19:08.439
You're calling here

19:07.146 --> 19:08.439
and having people

19:08.481 --> 19:10.066
sneak food out

19:08.481 --> 19:10.066
behind my back

19:10.108 --> 19:11.484
so that you can taste it.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.778
Wow. You paranoid or what?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.114
Jeez, man,

19:13.820 --> 19:16.114
time for a vacation.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.200
Hold on.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.200
Okay, here's the deal.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.079
Announcement, please,

19:20.242 --> 19:23.079
from this moment on..

19:23.121 --> 19:25.539
...there will be no more food

19:23.121 --> 19:25.539
leaving the premises.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.625
The food goes

19:25.581 --> 19:27.625
from here to the dining room

19:27.667 --> 19:29.293
or upstairs and that is it.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.879
No more food

19:29.335 --> 19:31.879
will<i> leave the premises.</i>

19:31.921 --> 19:34.924
<i>No quiero que ninguna comida</i>

19:31.921 --> 19:34.924
<i>salga de este lugar.</i>

19:34.966 --> 19:37.093
<i>Comprenden?</i> What about you?

19:34.966 --> 19:37.093
You<i> comprende?</i>

19:37.135 --> 19:38.803
That's<i> my</i> kitchen, Luke.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.554
And it will be here waiting

19:38.845 --> 19:40.554
for you when you get back.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.016
Until then, sit back, relax,

19:40.596 --> 19:43.016
and watch Ellen dance around

19:43.057 --> 19:44.142
a little. I got work to do.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.019
- Luke!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.019
- 'Goodbye.'

19:48.228 --> 19:50.148
- Hey, Paris.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.148
- Hey, Rory.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.865
- Oh!

19:56.236 --> 19:58.865
- Oh. I scare?

19:58.906 --> 20:01.283
No. Yes. Excuse me.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.455
- There's a woman in my room.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.455
- That's Nanny. You know Nanny.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.166
That makes me sad

20:06.497 --> 20:08.166
that you don't remember Nanny.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.583
She always liked you.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.669
She's stripping my bed.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.669
Why is she doing that?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.629
Well, she finally got Doyle

20:11.711 --> 20:13.629
to sleep and she has to do

20:13.671 --> 20:15.715
something. The woman

20:13.671 --> 20:15.715
doesn't tire. She's a machine.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.175
What do you mean she

20:15.756 --> 20:17.175
finally got Doyle to sleep?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.926
He's here. He's sick.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.553
- Nanny's taking care of him.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.553
- Why aren't you doing it?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.388
- Sick people freak me out.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.388
- You're pre-med!

20:22.429 --> 20:24.431
I'm really tired of having that

20:22.429 --> 20:24.431
constantly thrown in my face.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.517
Paris, could you please just

20:24.473 --> 20:26.517
get Nanny out of my room?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.352
'Cause I have dinner with Logan

20:26.559 --> 20:28.352
tonight and I have to get ready.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.812
Logan! I thought

20:28.394 --> 20:29.812
you guys were--

20:29.854 --> 20:31.772
- 'We were.'

20:29.854 --> 20:31.772
- What happened?

20:31.814 --> 20:34.608
Well, I told him that I didn't

20:31.814 --> 20:34.608
think things were working

20:34.650 --> 20:36.736
and that we should just be

20:34.650 --> 20:36.736
friends but he didn't wanna be--

20:36.777 --> 20:38.779
- Just friends?

20:36.777 --> 20:38.779
- No, it seemed to wake him up.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.239
So, now he wants

20:38.821 --> 20:40.239
to give commitment a try.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.158
- A commitment...with Logan.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.158
- Yep.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.243
I don't believe it. You did it.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.243
You landed the whale.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.162
- You're Annette Bening.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.162
- I'm not Annette Bening.

20:46.204 --> 20:49.790
It was just a matter of getting

20:46.204 --> 20:49.790
him to focus on the situation.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.500
Focus. Huh.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.169
<i>Vou para empoçar</i>

20:51.542 --> 20:53.169
<i>os seus sapatos.</i>

20:53.211 --> 20:56.505
- She's gonna buff your shoes.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.505
- I need these. Yeah.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.221
(Rory)

21:01.928 --> 21:03.221
'My God, my room is clean!'

21:03.262 --> 21:04.388
[door creaks]

21:08.267 --> 21:10.061
- Wow!

21:08.267 --> 21:10.061
- Uh, where are my keys?

21:10.103 --> 21:13.313
- What did I do with my keys?

21:10.103 --> 21:13.313
- Just your parents live here?

21:13.355 --> 21:15.858
- Oh, got them.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.858
- Well.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.735
I certainly hope

21:15.900 --> 21:17.735
the drainage is good.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.903
Excuse me?

21:18.945 --> 21:19.946
Because if it's not good

21:19.987 --> 21:21.030
and you have pooling somewhere

21:21.072 --> 21:22.198
you may not know it for months.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.950
I'll be sure

21:22.240 --> 21:23.950
to mention that to them.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.453
- You look nervous.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.453
- Do I? Huh.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.829
Just not so sure

21:27.494 --> 21:28.829
what I got you into.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.497
- What do you mean?

21:28.871 --> 21:30.497
- Well..

21:30.539 --> 21:31.958
My family's not gonna take

21:30.539 --> 21:31.958
my sister's engagement too well

21:31.999 --> 21:33.626
and they can be

21:31.999 --> 21:33.626
a little vicious when annoyed.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.086
Hey, relax.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.879
You do not have to

21:35.128 --> 21:36.879
worry about me at all.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.756
Five years of Friday dinners

21:36.921 --> 21:38.756
have prepared me

21:38.798 --> 21:39.799
for exactly this moment.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.300
Really?

21:41.341 --> 21:42.635
Remind me to tell you

21:41.341 --> 21:42.635
about the time my mom

21:42.676 --> 21:44.137
climbed out

21:42.676 --> 21:44.137
a second-story window

21:44.178 --> 21:45.596
to get away

21:44.178 --> 21:45.596
from my grandmother.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.598
Oh, I will.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.978
- Okay, ready?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.978
- Ready.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.857
[doorbell rings]

21:59.068 --> 22:00.736
- You are late.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.736
- 15 minutes.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.321
Well, it's awful. A morgue.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.157
It's like they already know

22:02.362 --> 22:04.157
what I'm going to tell them.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.033
Well, you<i> have</i> been

22:04.198 --> 22:06.033
with Josh for three years now.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.244
I don't understand it, I called

22:06.075 --> 22:08.244
and told them you were coming

22:08.286 --> 22:10.246
because that usually

22:08.286 --> 22:10.246
makes mom happy.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.664
And I told them

22:10.288 --> 22:11.664
you were bringing Rory

22:11.705 --> 22:13.124
so they'd be

22:11.705 --> 22:13.124
on their company behavior.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.001
But from the minute

22:13.166 --> 22:15.001
Josh and I walked in that door

22:15.042 --> 22:16.961
it's been Iceberg City.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.213
Josh is completely

22:17.003 --> 22:19.213
panicked, shaking.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.840
- Wow. Sorry.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.840
- Don't be sorry.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.592
Just get in here and stop it.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.344
Hmm, remind me to tell you

22:23.634 --> 22:26.344
about the time my mother

22:26.386 --> 22:28.430
wore a shirt with

22:26.386 --> 22:28.430
a rhinestone penis on it

22:28.472 --> 22:30.390
and my grandma

22:28.472 --> 22:30.390
had her car towed.

22:35.771 --> 22:39.317
- Look at the ceiling!

22:35.771 --> 22:39.317
- Come on.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.777
- Have you<i> seen</i> this ceiling?

22:39.357 --> 22:41.777
- Hurry!

22:44.780 --> 22:47.116
Well, look what

22:44.780 --> 22:47.116
the cat dragged in.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.951
- Sorry we're late, everyone.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.951
- It's alright, Logan.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.996
We're still waiting

22:48.993 --> 22:51.996
for your father.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.122
Hey, grandpa.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.122
Nice to see you.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.414
You get those books

22:53.164 --> 22:54.414
I sent you?

22:54.456 --> 22:55.791
I did. Thank you. Hey, Josh.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.834
It's been a while.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.834
You're looking well.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.544
You too.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.420
Everyone, I'd like

22:58.585 --> 23:00.420
you to meet Rory Gilmore.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.048
Hi. It's really nice

23:00.462 --> 23:02.048
to meet you all.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.632
This house is amazing.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.135
Seriously, there should be

23:03.674 --> 23:06.135
a docent at the door.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.845
Well, thank you, Rory.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.514
You know Rory's grandparents,

23:07.887 --> 23:10.514
mom. Richard and Emily.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.767
Yes, of course.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.767
How are Richard and Emily doing?

23:13.809 --> 23:14.810
They're doing very well.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.520
Oh, that's wonderful.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.522
[ice rattling]

23:18.564 --> 23:19.732
Hm.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.075
So, um, you were

23:26.239 --> 23:29.075
at the wedding, right?

23:29.116 --> 23:31.952
Oh! Why, yes, we were.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.913
Oh, it was lovely.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.915
Emily certainly knows

23:33.954 --> 23:35.915
how to plan an event.

23:35.956 --> 23:38.834
That, she does. Hm.

23:38.876 --> 23:41.128
- I should send her a note.

23:38.876 --> 23:41.128
- Mmm.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.299
[ice rattling]

23:49.427 --> 23:52.181
Hey, grandpa, can I

23:49.427 --> 23:52.181
freshen your drink for you?

23:52.223 --> 23:54.474
- Mm-hmm.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.474
- Oh, I'm sorry.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.018
Can we get you something, Rory?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.811
'I got it, mom.'

24:07.696 --> 24:08.906
Oh, Logan,

24:07.696 --> 24:08.906
I don't think--

24:08.948 --> 24:11.867
- Club soda, Ace.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.867
- Oh, thanks.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.077
[sighs]

24:15.829 --> 24:17.623
Apparently, Mitchum

24:15.829 --> 24:17.623
is still at the office.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.583
We might as well start dinner.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.296
So, hmm?

24:23.337 --> 24:25.005
Come on, you'll feel better

24:23.337 --> 24:25.005
when you have some food.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.216
I'll feel better

24:25.047 --> 24:27.216
when we're leaving.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.968
So sorry. We owe you one.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.387
No.

24:31.429 --> 24:34.681
- Is that a Velazquez?

24:31.429 --> 24:34.681
- Come on.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.017
It is! That's a Velazquez!

24:37.059 --> 24:39.437
This house is so cool!

24:43.523 --> 24:46.068
So, I'm holding in my hand

24:43.523 --> 24:46.068
one of our comment cards

24:46.110 --> 24:47.945
on which a particular person

24:46.110 --> 24:47.945
has written and I quote

24:47.987 --> 24:50.239
"Best meal I've ever had.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.239
The duck was exceptional.

24:50.281 --> 24:53.033
The lamb chops were amazing.

24:50.281 --> 24:53.033
Ask the chef if he'll marry me."

24:53.075 --> 24:54.701
- What do you think?

24:53.075 --> 24:54.701
- What does she look like?

24:54.743 --> 24:56.162
I didn't say it was a she.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.247
- I'll stick with what I have.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.247
- Aw, sweet.

24:58.289 --> 24:59.415
I didn't know

24:58.289 --> 24:59.415
you were making lamb chops.

24:59.457 --> 25:00.707
Last-minute addition.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.168
You know, your

25:00.749 --> 25:02.168
kitchen crew here, is great.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.210
- Really?

25:02.209 --> 25:03.210
- Yeah.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.753
Mark, the salad guy, top-notch.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.005
Javier is one

25:04.795 --> 25:06.005
hell of a grill man.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.756
And Manny, your sous-chef..

25:07.798 --> 25:10.134
I'd kick Caesar out on his ass

25:07.798 --> 25:10.134
if I could steal Manny.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.551
Ah, you covet

25:10.176 --> 25:11.551
my kitchen staff.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.511
I'm feeling superior

25:11.593 --> 25:13.511
and I like it.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.017
Okay, guys, we need

25:16.223 --> 25:18.017
two sea basses, one chick

25:18.058 --> 25:20.102
and one pepper steak

25:18.058 --> 25:20.102
without the pepper, go figure.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.895
Where's Pedro going?

25:34.992 --> 25:37.453
I knew it!

25:34.992 --> 25:37.453
Are you insane?

25:37.495 --> 25:38.745
Well, you wouldn't

25:37.495 --> 25:38.745
take my calls.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.247
How long have you been up here?

25:40.289 --> 25:41.499
Since you made me promise

25:41.539 --> 25:43.083
that no food would leave

25:41.539 --> 25:43.083
the premises.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.711
Well, here I am,

25:43.125 --> 25:45.711
keeping my promises.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.171
- Pedro, give me the ladle.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.171
- Pedro.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.339
Do not give her that ladle.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.465
Give me the ladle, Pedro.

25:49.507 --> 25:51.425
<i>Vente junto conmigo,</i> Pedro.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.177
<i>Yo soy su jefe,</i> Pedro.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.762
- You're scaring Pedro.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.762
<i>- You're</i> scaring Pedro.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.515
'All day long,

25:55.804 --> 25:57.515
things are disappearing.'

25:57.555 --> 25:58.974
Salads are suddenly gone.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.101
Lamb chops don't make it

25:59.016 --> 26:01.101
to the table.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.020
I had to make sure

26:01.143 --> 26:03.020
you were doing it right.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.980
- You're supposed to be home!

26:03.062 --> 26:04.980
- No!

26:05.022 --> 26:07.107
I'm supposed to be in bed.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.107
And I'm in bed.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.817
'And you said you would

26:07.149 --> 26:08.817
double-strain the duck sauce'

26:08.859 --> 26:11.195
and you, my friend,

26:08.859 --> 26:11.195
are not double-straining.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.530
'There will be no more of this.'

26:12.570 --> 26:14.572
No more calls.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.572
No more questions.

26:14.614 --> 26:17.701
No more ladles

26:14.614 --> 26:17.701
that leave that kitchen.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.245
I don't care

26:17.743 --> 26:19.245
what bed you're in.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.704
That is between

26:19.286 --> 26:20.704
you and your husband

26:20.746 --> 26:22.789
and God, I hope

26:20.746 --> 26:22.789
a qualified therapist.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.959
But you will not

26:22.831 --> 26:25.959
interfere with me<i> anymore.</i>

26:26.001 --> 26:27.753
Period.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.091
Give me that.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.137
So, grandpa.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.137
How's the new boat?

26:37.179 --> 26:38.431
It's a boat.

26:38.472 --> 26:40.140
- It floats.

26:38.472 --> 26:40.140
- I hear it's beautiful.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.350
When are you gonna

26:40.182 --> 26:41.350
let me take her out?

26:41.392 --> 26:42.893
Now, Logan, you don't have

26:42.935 --> 26:44.728
the best track record

26:42.935 --> 26:44.728
when it comes to boats.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.730
Only other people's boats.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.730
Our boats are very safe.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.148
We should do

26:46.772 --> 26:48.148
a summer trip, maybe hit

26:48.190 --> 26:49.567
the amalfi coast again?

26:49.607 --> 26:51.402
All of us,

26:49.607 --> 26:51.402
Rory, Josh, you, me.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.445
[thumping]

26:52.486 --> 26:54.238
- 'Dad.'

26:52.486 --> 26:54.238
- Maria!

26:54.280 --> 26:55.697
- 'Yes, sir.'

26:54.280 --> 26:55.697
- It's too hot.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.657
- Bring me a salad.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.657
- Hmm-mm.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.452
I'll be right back.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.623
- What?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.623
- Mom's a stress smoker.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.168
Oh, I don't understand

27:05.665 --> 27:08.168
why everyone's so upset.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.669
- Josh seems fine.

27:08.210 --> 27:09.669
- Oh.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.046
The Huntzbergers

27:09.711 --> 27:11.046
aren't interested in "fine."

27:11.088 --> 27:12.590
- 'Shira!'

27:11.088 --> 27:12.590
- 'Yes, dad?'

27:12.630 --> 27:14.550
What time did Mitchum say

27:12.630 --> 27:14.550
he'd be here?

27:14.592 --> 27:15.675
[coughing]

27:15.717 --> 27:17.719
I don't know. He didn't say.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.473
- 'Well, this is ridiculous.'

27:17.761 --> 27:20.473
- Please, dad.

27:20.514 --> 27:21.932
We're all just gonna

27:20.514 --> 27:21.932
sit around this table

27:21.974 --> 27:23.476
and pretend

27:21.974 --> 27:23.476
there's nothing going on?

27:23.517 --> 27:25.144
Let's just wait for Mitchum.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.563
There are serious matters

27:25.185 --> 27:27.563
to be discussed here.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.064
This is an important family.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.649
'Marrying into it

27:29.106 --> 27:31.649
is important business.'

27:31.691 --> 27:34.987
'But, no, we can't discuss this

27:31.691 --> 27:34.987
until Mitchum gets here.'

27:35.028 --> 27:36.780
What is this? Go away!

27:36.822 --> 27:38.907
Okay, I'm sorry.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.907
I have to jump in here.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.494
Grandpa, we all respect

27:38.949 --> 27:41.494
you and mom and dad

27:41.535 --> 27:44.079
but the bottom line here

27:41.535 --> 27:44.079
is Honor has to be happy.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.165
- Now, if she loves Josh, then--

27:44.121 --> 27:46.165
- 'Logan.'

27:46.206 --> 27:49.084
I appreciate you defending me

27:46.206 --> 27:49.084
but I can take it from here.

27:49.126 --> 27:51.295
Mom, grandpa.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.838
I had hoped that

27:51.337 --> 27:52.838
you would be happy for me

27:52.879 --> 27:55.048
but obviously,

27:52.879 --> 27:55.048
that's not going to happen.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.258
You didn't even

27:55.090 --> 27:56.258
let me announce it

27:56.300 --> 27:57.801
to you before

27:56.300 --> 27:57.801
you formed your opinion.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.303
'And I'm sorry

27:57.843 --> 27:59.303
you feel the way you do'

27:59.345 --> 28:01.472
'but Josh and I

27:59.345 --> 28:01.472
made it official last week.'

28:01.514 --> 28:03.182
We're engaged now

28:01.514 --> 28:03.182
and no matter what you say

28:03.223 --> 28:06.018
we are going to

28:03.223 --> 28:06.018
get married...in June.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.645
Well, of course,

28:06.059 --> 28:07.645
you're going to get married.

28:07.685 --> 28:09.438
You've been dating

28:07.685 --> 28:09.438
for three years and I already

28:09.480 --> 28:12.358
put a hold on the Japanese

28:09.480 --> 28:12.358
tea garden for next spring.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.318
Oh. Well..

28:15.486 --> 28:16.987
That sounds great. Thank you.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.614
So we should

28:17.029 --> 28:18.614
celebrate, then.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.866
We'll celebrate when

28:18.656 --> 28:20.866
we've finished our discussion.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.159
Which discussion?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.328
'The discussion

28:22.201 --> 28:24.328
about unsuitable people'

28:24.370 --> 28:25.954
'marrying into this family.'

28:25.996 --> 28:27.914
- What?

28:25.996 --> 28:27.914
- I'll be right back.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.542
You should know better

28:27.956 --> 28:29.542
than this, Logan.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.460
'I know you like to

28:29.583 --> 28:31.460
joke around and tease us'

28:31.502 --> 28:33.962
but I always thought

28:31.502 --> 28:33.962
at the end of the day

28:34.004 --> 28:35.881
you understood what

28:34.004 --> 28:35.881
your responsibilities

28:35.922 --> 28:37.424
to this family were.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.843
Mom, I suggest you

28:37.466 --> 28:39.843
come back in here right now.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.514
Logan, you just

28:39.885 --> 28:43.514
haven't thought about this.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.558
'I mean, I'm sure

28:43.556 --> 28:45.558
Rory understands.'

28:45.599 --> 28:48.268
'She wants to work.

28:45.599 --> 28:48.268
Isn't that right, Rory?'

28:48.310 --> 28:51.188
'Emily's always talking about

28:48.310 --> 28:51.188
you wanting to be a reporter'

28:51.230 --> 28:53.815
'and travel around

28:51.230 --> 28:53.815
doing this and that.'

28:53.857 --> 28:55.651
A girl like Rory has no idea

28:55.693 --> 28:57.944
what it takes

28:55.693 --> 28:57.944
to be in this family, Logan.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.155
- Oh, my God.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.155
- 'She wasn't raised that way.'

29:00.197 --> 29:01.740
'She wasn't bred for it.'

29:01.781 --> 29:03.909
'And this isn't at all

29:01.781 --> 29:03.909
about her mother.'

29:03.950 --> 29:06.912
'It's just, you come from

29:03.950 --> 29:06.912
two totally different worlds.'

29:06.953 --> 29:08.581
It would never work.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.375
Not for you

29:08.622 --> 29:11.375
and certainly not for us.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.169
Okay, this conversation is gonna

29:11.417 --> 29:14.169
end right now. I'm not gonna--

29:14.211 --> 29:16.171
<i>You</i> are gonna be

29:14.211 --> 29:16.171
taking over this company!

29:16.213 --> 29:17.756
That's what

29:16.213 --> 29:17.756
you are gonna be doing.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.008
'And when you do, you're going

29:17.797 --> 29:20.008
to need the right'

29:20.050 --> 29:23.262
'kind of person at your side.

29:20.050 --> 29:23.262
This isn't college, Logan.'

29:23.303 --> 29:25.639
(Shira)

29:23.303 --> 29:25.639
'And whatever happened

29:23.303 --> 29:25.639
to that Fallon girl?'

29:25.681 --> 29:28.392
'I loved her.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.392
Do you talk anymore?'

29:28.434 --> 29:30.728
No, we don't talk.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.728
We never talked.<i> You</i> talked.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.021
Oh, what a shame!

29:30.769 --> 29:33.021
I just loved her.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.648
Okay, let's go.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.942
'Logan, you have to understand'

29:36.983 --> 29:39.111
you bring this girl home

29:36.983 --> 29:39.111
without any warning at all

29:39.152 --> 29:41.988
and Honor tells us you're

29:39.152 --> 29:41.988
calling her your girlfriend?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.366
Well, we have to

29:42.030 --> 29:44.366
take that seriously.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.034
Logan, come back here.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.745
- I don't understand.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.745
- They're psychotic.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.037
What more is there

29:47.786 --> 29:49.037
to understand?

29:49.079 --> 29:51.373
But why don't they think

29:49.079 --> 29:51.373
I'm good enough?

29:51.415 --> 29:53.542
- Rory.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.542
- I mean, I'm a Gilmore.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.168
Do they know that?

29:55.210 --> 29:57.713
My ancestors came over

29:55.210 --> 29:57.713
on the Mayflower.

29:57.755 --> 29:59.798
Don't try and analyze it.

29:57.755 --> 29:59.798
There's no rhyme or reason.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.509
I had a coming-out party.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.509
I went to Chilton and Yale.

30:02.551 --> 30:06.179
And why are they okay with Josh?

30:02.551 --> 30:06.179
He doesn't even say anything.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.847
At least<i> I</i> noticed

30:06.221 --> 30:07.847
the Velazquez.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.767
Josh isn't marrying the heir

30:07.889 --> 30:09.767
of the Huntzberger fortune.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.935
You are. I gotta get

30:09.808 --> 30:11.935
out of here.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.313
Logan. Perfect.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.606
Did they start dinner?

30:15.648 --> 30:17.983
And is it some sort

30:15.648 --> 30:17.983
of precious fish dish?

30:18.024 --> 30:19.610
Because I'm dying for a steak.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.028
You're Rory, I assume.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.028
Heard a lot about you.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.614
- We're leaving.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.614
- What? Why?

30:23.656 --> 30:25.949
- You know why.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.949
- Had a long day, Logan.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.576
Don't wanna play games.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.576
Is dinner over?

30:27.618 --> 30:30.287
No. The Huntzberger family

30:27.618 --> 30:30.287
<i>Shanghai</i> is over.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.580
Dinner, however,

30:30.329 --> 30:31.580
is still going on.

30:31.622 --> 30:34.541
Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay.

30:31.622 --> 30:34.541
What happened?

30:36.001 --> 30:39.546
Oh, no. Why is

30:36.001 --> 30:39.546
your mother smoking?

30:39.588 --> 30:43.300
We have to go. I'm sure they'll

30:39.588 --> 30:43.300
fill you in on everything.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.260
It was nice to meet you.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.644
[laughing]

30:53.686 --> 30:55.604
Paris, come on in.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.604
We're just chatting.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.564
- I see that.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.564
- I gotta tell you, Paris.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.733
You're right.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.733
This stuff is magic.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.694
<i>Esa é mágica.</i>

31:01.735 --> 31:03.362
She just taught me that.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.947
<i>Eu vou fazer</i>

31:03.403 --> 31:05.947
<i>mais sopa para você.</i>

31:05.989 --> 31:07.741
- Hmm-mm.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.741
- Uh-huh.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.411
- 'She's great.'

31:09.034 --> 31:11.411
- Yeah, she is.

31:11.453 --> 31:12.538
So, you seem better.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.247
'I am<i> so</i> much better.'

31:14.289 --> 31:15.999
Nanny's got me salving

31:14.289 --> 31:15.999
every four hours.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.668
I've steamed,

31:16.041 --> 31:17.668
I've had soup.

31:17.710 --> 31:20.170
All I need is one more

31:17.710 --> 31:20.170
good Nyquil knockout sleep

31:20.212 --> 31:21.963
and I'll be as good as new.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.842
- Hey, could you?

31:22.005 --> 31:24.842
- Oh, sure.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.303
I gotta tell you, Paris.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.303
You're a life saver. Really.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.559
'Paris?'

31:33.600 --> 31:36.061
- Paris, the Nyquil.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.061
- Doyle.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.146
It's time we have a talk

31:36.102 --> 31:38.146
about our relationship.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.357
- But..

31:38.188 --> 31:40.357
- Doyle! Focus.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.775
[door slamming]

31:41.817 --> 31:43.360
- Hey, you in the hat.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.360
- Jackson, what--

31:43.402 --> 31:45.738
How dare you take a ladle

31:43.402 --> 31:45.738
from a pregnant woman?

31:45.779 --> 31:48.198
Dr. Mank very specifically said

31:45.779 --> 31:48.198
that she needs to relax.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.575
And she cannot relax thinking

31:49.616 --> 31:51.117
you're in here

31:49.616 --> 31:51.117
screwing up her sauce!

31:51.159 --> 31:52.160
- I'm not.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.160
- Now.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.245
While there's a very good chance

31:53.286 --> 31:54.329
that you could

31:53.286 --> 31:54.329
kill me in a fight

31:54.371 --> 31:55.455
I do not care.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.540
That woman is my wife.

31:56.582 --> 31:57.875
And she is carrying my baby.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.042
So, from now on

31:59.084 --> 32:00.836
if she wants to talk,

31:59.084 --> 32:00.836
you will talk.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.588
If she wants

32:00.878 --> 32:02.588
to taste your food

32:02.629 --> 32:03.963
you will let her

32:02.629 --> 32:03.963
taste your food.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.758
If she wants you

32:04.005 --> 32:05.758
to double-strain that sauce

32:05.799 --> 32:07.634
you<i> will</i> double-strain

32:05.799 --> 32:07.634
that sauce, my friend.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.177
Because I have to live with her

32:07.676 --> 32:09.177
and if she is upset

32:09.219 --> 32:10.679
because of anything

32:09.219 --> 32:10.679
that you've done

32:10.721 --> 32:13.139
I will come over here and I'll

32:10.721 --> 32:13.139
soundly kick your ass!

32:13.181 --> 32:15.100
That is if you haven't

32:13.181 --> 32:15.100
killed me yet.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.061
Hey!

32:22.023 --> 32:24.192
Hey. That's it.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.192
I've had it.

32:24.234 --> 32:25.944
You've had what?

32:25.985 --> 32:28.280
She's a crazy woman,

32:25.985 --> 32:28.280
and now she's upstairs.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.116
And ladles are mysteriously

32:28.321 --> 32:31.116
flying out of the kitchen.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.868
- Who's upstairs?

32:31.157 --> 32:32.868
- Sookie's upstairs.

32:32.910 --> 32:33.993
- No, Sookie's at home.

32:32.910 --> 32:33.993
- No.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.287
Sookie's<i> supposed</i> to be at home.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.831
And then I didn't

32:35.328 --> 32:37.831
strain the sauce twice

32:37.873 --> 32:39.708
so she came here

32:37.873 --> 32:39.708
to drive me crazy

32:39.750 --> 32:41.376
and she brought

32:39.750 --> 32:41.376
her loony husband with her!

32:41.418 --> 32:42.669
Jackson's here?

32:41.418 --> 32:42.669
How am I missing all this?

32:42.711 --> 32:44.713
I don't know

32:42.711 --> 32:44.713
and I don't care.

32:44.755 --> 32:47.048
I'm through!

32:44.755 --> 32:47.048
I'm not taking this anymore!

32:47.090 --> 32:49.593
What do you mean, "you're taking

32:47.090 --> 32:49.593
anymore?" What are you gonna do?

32:49.635 --> 32:51.136
You want to know

32:49.635 --> 32:51.136
what I'm gonna do? Nothing!

32:51.177 --> 32:52.512
Because I am

32:51.177 --> 32:52.512
in a relationship with you.

32:52.554 --> 32:53.722
And you know very well

32:52.554 --> 32:53.722
I can't leave!

32:53.764 --> 32:55.014
All I can do is come out here

32:55.056 --> 32:56.141
and say, "I'm through"

32:55.056 --> 32:56.141
and pretend

32:56.182 --> 32:57.517
I have a leg to stand on

32:57.559 --> 32:59.018
and then march back

32:57.559 --> 32:59.018
into that kitchen

32:59.060 --> 33:00.771
'and keep doing

32:59.060 --> 33:00.771
the job but oh boy!'

33:00.813 --> 33:02.314
I'm gonna be thinking

33:00.813 --> 33:02.314
about what I would've done

33:02.355 --> 33:04.274
if we weren't in

33:02.355 --> 33:04.274
a relationship even though

33:04.316 --> 33:05.525
that would mean

33:04.316 --> 33:05.525
I wouldn't be in this position

33:05.567 --> 33:07.486
in the first place.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.486
Excuse me.

Oh!

Uh, if this is

33:18.831 --> 33:21.374
the eccentric-couple version

33:21.416 --> 33:23.460
of "The Amazing Race,"

33:21.416 --> 33:23.460
I think you guys are winning.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.838
Are we talking to her? I don't

33:23.502 --> 33:25.838
think we're talking to her.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.631
- Hey, it's Lorelai.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.631
- Girlfriend of Luke.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.090
And we're not talking to Luke.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.134
<i>I'm</i> talking to Lorelai.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.134
How you doing?

33:31.176 --> 33:33.428
- Sookie, this is not bed rest.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.428
- My feet are up.

33:33.470 --> 33:34.888
I told you not to talk to her.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.389
What is with the 'tude,

33:34.930 --> 33:36.389
cranky pants?

33:36.431 --> 33:38.266
- He's very mad at Luke.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.266
- Well, I'm not Luke.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.768
By extension, you<i> are</i> Luke.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.854
Sookie, what were you doing

33:39.810 --> 33:41.854
at the inn?

33:41.895 --> 33:43.146
Checking in on

33:41.895 --> 33:43.146
the restaurant.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.190
- That's my job.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.190
- Uh, not anymore.

33:45.231 --> 33:49.027
- Your job is bed rest.

33:45.231 --> 33:49.027
- Oh, honey, easy on the bumps.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.779
- Baby doesn't like the bumps.

- Jackson, stop.

Stop! At least let me ride.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.663
- Oh.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.663
- Okay, go.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.540
Sookie, you knew

33:59.705 --> 34:01.540
the day was coming

34:01.581 --> 34:03.166
when you wouldn't

34:01.581 --> 34:03.166
be able to come in.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.835
I had three weeks.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.670
You never had

34:04.877 --> 34:06.670
any applications, did you?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.797
I meant to.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.797
No one was good enough.

34:08.839 --> 34:11.466
Well, no one's as good as<i> you,</i>

34:08.839 --> 34:11.466

We just need one of them, just

34:11.508 --> 34:13.760
till you're back on your feet.

I know.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.262
Luke's not as

34:15.136 --> 34:16.262
good as you either.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.890
That kind of cooking's

34:16.304 --> 34:17.890
a little fancy

34:17.931 --> 34:19.224
for him but he tried.

34:19.265 --> 34:20.433
Hey, he's not bad.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.352
He's pretty good, in fact.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.730
- What does he put in these?

34:22.394 --> 34:24.730
- What is that?

34:24.771 --> 34:26.064
His lamb chops.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.064
They're amazing.

34:26.105 --> 34:27.399
I'm taking them home to study.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.901
Well, you could have

34:27.440 --> 34:28.901
just asked him.

34:28.942 --> 34:31.110
- Hmm, he's mad at me.

34:28.942 --> 34:31.110
- We're mad at<i> him.</i>

34:31.152 --> 34:33.071
Well, we're all gonna stop

34:31.152 --> 34:33.071
being mad at each other.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.531
- Now, pull over.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.531
- Why?

34:34.573 --> 34:36.324
Because you live here.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.577
Oh, yeah.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.788
You know, Luke said that-that

34:38.618 --> 34:41.788
Manny was-was doing pretty well.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.540
I know. I trained him.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.042
You know, when I first

34:43.582 --> 34:45.042
met him he didn't know

34:45.083 --> 34:46.793
a gefilte from a chiffonade.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.253
Yeah, well,

34:46.835 --> 34:48.253
he's from New Jersey.

34:48.294 --> 34:49.671
But he picked it up quick.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.256
Maybe he can take over

34:49.713 --> 34:51.256
while you're out.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.926
Keep it in the family.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.926
He knows all your secrets.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.302
Okay. We'll go with Manny.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.302
He's a good guy.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.763
I think that's a good idea.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.222
- Thank Luke for me.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.222
- I will.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.891
And find out

34:59.264 --> 35:00.891
what's in these lamb chops

35:00.933 --> 35:02.350
driving me crazy.

I promise.

Jackson, get her inside.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.144
And don't let her move.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.605
How are you gonna get back?

35:06.646 --> 35:08.147
I thought

35:06.646 --> 35:08.147
I'd take the cart you stole.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.232
Oh, perfect.

So, okay if I

35:19.701 --> 35:22.621
just drop you here?

35:22.662 --> 35:25.457
- Drop me here?

35:22.662 --> 35:25.457
- Lights are on. Paris is home.

I've had about all the crazy

35:25.498 --> 35:27.542
I can for one evening.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.210
Okay. Sure.

You know, we don't

35:29.252 --> 35:30.295
have to go in.

35:30.336 --> 35:33.006
We can go get something to eat.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.550
- I'm not hungry.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.550
- Okay.

I just wanna walk a little,

35:38.095 --> 35:39.304
Okay.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.515
I'll call you later.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.060
- Tomorrow?

- Uh, yeah, tomorrow.

What did you put

36:20.679 --> 36:23.306

- Forget it.

- Well..

36:43.618 --> 36:45.453
To make a long story short

36:45.495 --> 36:47.039
Logan's family hates me.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.332
That's impossible.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.332
It's like hating Thumper.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.459
- No one hates Thumper.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.459
- They think I'm trash.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.920
They think I'm not good enough

36:51.501 --> 36:53.920
to marry into their family.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.213
What are they talking about?

36:55.254 --> 36:56.464
Don't they know

36:55.254 --> 36:56.464
you're a Gilmore?

36:56.506 --> 36:57.507
I don't think they care.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.550
And who said anything about

36:58.591 --> 36:59.843
marrying into their family?

36:59.885 --> 37:01.761
Apparently, Logan

36:59.885 --> 37:01.761
bringing me over

37:01.803 --> 37:04.514
for dinner said that I was going

37:01.803 --> 37:04.514
to marry into their family.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.141
- 'Uh, that's crazy.'

37:04.556 --> 37:06.141
- I know.

37:06.183 --> 37:07.392
But they just got all panicked

37:06.183 --> 37:07.392
and they started

37:07.433 --> 37:08.434
saying these things.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.644
To your face?

37:09.686 --> 37:10.770
- At the dinner table.

37:09.686 --> 37:10.770
- What?

37:10.812 --> 37:12.064
'They went on and on about'

37:12.105 --> 37:13.940
how I'm going to be

37:12.105 --> 37:13.940
a career woman

37:13.982 --> 37:15.525
and "Logan,

37:13.982 --> 37:15.525
you don't want that.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.069
"She won't understand

37:15.567 --> 37:17.069
our lifestyle

37:17.110 --> 37:20.655
or the demands or,

37:17.110 --> 37:20.655
or the family responsibilities."

37:20.697 --> 37:23.241
What family responsibilities?

37:20.697 --> 37:23.241
Who are they, the Gambinos?

37:23.282 --> 37:25.493
Then his mother starts in

37:23.282 --> 37:25.493
on "that lovely Fallon girl"

37:25.535 --> 37:27.412
and doesn't Logan

37:25.535 --> 37:27.412
see her anymore?

37:27.453 --> 37:29.039
Because she would make

37:27.453 --> 37:29.039
a perfect choice.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.958
- What did you say?

37:29.081 --> 37:31.958
- 'Nothing. I just sat there.'

37:32.000 --> 37:34.502
I just sat there and let them

37:32.000 --> 37:34.502
say that I wasn't good enough

37:34.544 --> 37:36.671
and that Logan was

37:34.544 --> 37:36.671
making a mistake

37:36.713 --> 37:39.465
and just wait

37:36.713 --> 37:39.465
till his father came home.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.967
I hate these people.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.301
'It was awful.'

37:42.343 --> 37:44.512
Oh, well, Logan didn't

37:42.343 --> 37:44.512
just sit there

37:44.554 --> 37:46.181
and let them attack you

37:44.554 --> 37:46.181
all night, did he?

37:46.223 --> 37:48.975
No, he got really mad

37:46.223 --> 37:48.975
and told them they were crazy.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.019
- And then we left.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.019
- Well, good for him.

37:51.061 --> 37:55.398
But we didn't say a word

37:51.061 --> 37:55.398
to each other all the way home.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.944
And then,

37:55.440 --> 37:58.944
walking back to my dorm

37:58.985 --> 38:01.196
he just looked so freaked.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.865
I-I could tell

38:01.238 --> 38:03.865
that he was just..

38:03.907 --> 38:06.826
I don't know,

38:03.907 --> 38:06.826
rethinking everything.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.411
'The whole relationship.'

38:09.788 --> 38:11.539
I'm so afraid

38:09.788 --> 38:11.539
he's gonna bolt.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.210
Mom?

38:15.252 --> 38:18.088
Can I say something, something

38:15.252 --> 38:18.088
you may not wanna hear?

38:18.130 --> 38:19.505
'Yes.'

38:19.547 --> 38:21.340
If he is gonna bolt

38:19.547 --> 38:21.340
maybe you should

38:21.382 --> 38:23.593
<i>let</i> him bolt.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.593
He told you, Rory.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.263
'He told you, he was not

38:23.635 --> 38:26.263
a commitment kind of guy'

38:26.304 --> 38:28.932
just like you're not

38:26.304 --> 38:28.932
a non-commitment kind of girl.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.892
And you tried to be

38:28.974 --> 38:30.892
something you weren't

38:30.934 --> 38:32.560
and it was bad

38:30.934 --> 38:32.560
and it didn't work for you.

38:32.602 --> 38:34.813
Don't try and force him

38:32.602 --> 38:34.813
to be something he's not.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.439
- I didn't force him.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.439
- I know.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.942
But he was looking

38:36.481 --> 38:38.942
at losing you

38:38.984 --> 38:41.402
and he didn't want to

38:38.984 --> 38:41.402
and I give him credit for that.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.362
But maybe in the end

38:41.444 --> 38:43.362
this is not the guy

38:43.404 --> 38:44.990
or the relationship for you.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.532
I don't care

38:45.031 --> 38:46.532
what his family thinks.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.201
This has nothing to do

38:46.574 --> 38:48.201
with his family.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.203
We're good together, mom.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.203
I'm good for him.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.371
- Maybe<i> he</i> isn't good for<i> you. </i>

38:50.245 --> 38:52.371
- People can change.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.749
'Do you really wanna be in the

38:52.413 --> 38:54.749
business of changing someone?'

38:54.791 --> 38:56.584
- Maybe he<i> wants</i> to change.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.584
- Rory.

38:56.626 --> 38:58.461
Two days ago,

38:56.626 --> 38:58.461
you were on the bathroom floor

38:58.503 --> 39:00.213
crying about

38:58.503 --> 39:00.213
why he won't call you

39:00.255 --> 39:01.673
why doesn't he like you,

39:00.255 --> 39:01.673
what did you do.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.633
I was drunk. I was sick.

39:03.675 --> 39:07.012
<i>You,</i> my beautiful, brainy,

39:03.675 --> 39:07.012
fabulous daughter

39:07.053 --> 39:09.222
were lying on the floor

39:07.053 --> 39:09.222
of the bathroom

39:09.264 --> 39:10.807
wondering

39:09.264 --> 39:10.807
what you had done wrong

39:10.849 --> 39:12.725
which is disturbing to me

39:10.849 --> 39:12.725
on several levels

39:12.767 --> 39:14.894
including the fact that

39:12.767 --> 39:14.894
I can't remember the last time

39:14.936 --> 39:16.688
I cleaned the

39:14.936 --> 39:16.688
floor of the bathroom.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.940
'Is that really the kind of

39:16.729 --> 39:18.940
relationship you wanna be in?'

39:18.982 --> 39:20.817
[knock on door]

39:20.859 --> 39:22.485
Hold on.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.445
[knock on door]

39:29.367 --> 39:32.204
Hey.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.705
Everything okay?

39:33.746 --> 39:35.915
- I'm sorry.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.915
- For what?

39:35.957 --> 39:38.001
For just taking off like that.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.544
I just..

39:39.585 --> 39:41.087
This was a very

39:39.585 --> 39:41.087
intense evening for me.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.130
I'm sure.

39:42.172 --> 39:43.589
But taking off like that

39:43.631 --> 39:44.674
I was overreacting.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.468
That's just stupid, so..

39:47.510 --> 39:49.762
...forgive me?

39:49.804 --> 39:52.891
- There's nothing to forgive.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.891
- Come on. Grab your coat.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.726
I'll take you

39:52.932 --> 39:54.726
to get something to eat.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.728
Okay. I'll be right back.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.069
- Did you hear that?

40:01.649 --> 40:04.069
- Yeah, I sure did.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.196
Everything's fine. I just

40:04.110 --> 40:06.196
got upset about nothing.

40:06.238 --> 40:08.073
- Okay, but--

40:06.238 --> 40:08.073
- Thanks for the talk, mom.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.700
And I heard you

40:08.114 --> 40:10.700
but I have to go.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.744
Okay. Call me tomorrow.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.537
I will.

40:16.331 --> 40:17.332
[telephone beeps]

40:20.793 --> 40:21.961
He got dumped two years ago.

40:22.003 --> 40:23.380
Apparently, it was a vicious

40:23.421 --> 40:25.423
Julia Roberts to

40:23.421 --> 40:25.423
Kiefer Sutherland kind of dump.

40:25.464 --> 40:27.342
She broke his heart, slept

40:25.464 --> 40:27.342
with his best friend and took

40:27.384 --> 40:29.761
the dog. He swore off women

40:27.384 --> 40:29.761
completely until he met me.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.097
Wow! That was a lot of ground

40:29.802 --> 40:32.097
you guys covered last night.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.099
He finally admitted, once

40:32.138 --> 40:34.099
his cough started coming back

40:34.140 --> 40:36.393
that what we have,

40:34.140 --> 40:36.393
he no longer views as casual.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.852
He said we're officially

40:36.434 --> 40:37.852
in a committed..

40:37.894 --> 40:39.271
Hey, I know that word.

40:39.312 --> 40:40.688
...relationship, and I wouldn't

40:39.312 --> 40:40.688
be out of line

40:40.730 --> 40:42.357
if I called

40:40.730 --> 40:42.357
myself his girlfriend.

40:42.399 --> 40:43.733
And then I handed him the Nyquil

40:43.775 --> 40:44.984
and then he passed out.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.569
- Very romantic.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.569
- 'I know.'

40:46.611 --> 40:48.905
- 'I'm happy for you.'

40:46.611 --> 40:48.905
- 'I'm happy for me too.'

40:48.947 --> 40:50.907
- Mr. Huntzberger.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.907
- Hello, there.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.409
- Hello, Rory.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.409
- Hi.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.160
Paris Geller.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.160
We met a couple of months ago.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.788
I remember the handshake.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.788
Reminded me of Jimmy Breslin's.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.748
- High compliment.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.748
- Would you excuse us?

40:58.790 --> 41:01.459
Oh, sure.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.502
You're looking for Logan?

41:03.544 --> 41:05.671
No. I know better than to look

41:03.544 --> 41:05.671
for my son in the newsroom.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.507
- I came to talk to<i> you. </i>

41:05.713 --> 41:08.507
- About what?

41:08.549 --> 41:10.468
I'm very sorry about what

41:08.549 --> 41:10.468
happened the other night.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.762
- It's okay.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.762
- My family behaved atrociously.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.513
And though Logan

41:12.804 --> 41:14.513
was a little naive

41:14.555 --> 41:17.058
to walk into the lion's den

41:14.555 --> 41:17.058
without a chair like that

41:17.100 --> 41:19.352
they were wrong

41:17.100 --> 41:19.352
and you deserve an apology.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.520
Okay. Thank you.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.731
So, I hear you have some rather

41:23.773 --> 41:25.608
lofty journalistic aspirations.

41:25.650 --> 41:26.901
I have plans.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.194
'You know my company

41:26.943 --> 41:28.194
just acquired'

41:28.236 --> 41:29.279
'a small newspaper'

41:29.321 --> 41:31.281
the<i> Stanford Eagle Gazette.</i>

41:31.323 --> 41:33.074
Decent circulation,

41:31.323 --> 41:33.074
pretty sorry writing

41:33.116 --> 41:34.951
but definite potential.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.662
When we buy a new paper,

41:34.993 --> 41:37.662
I like to spend some time there

41:37.703 --> 41:39.205
take a couple of months,

41:37.703 --> 41:39.205
help turn it around

41:39.247 --> 41:40.873
make sure we're

41:39.247 --> 41:40.873
getting our money's worth.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.126
'Stanford isn't a bad train

41:40.915 --> 41:43.126
ride from here, is it?'

41:43.168 --> 41:44.669
Um, no.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.672
I have an internship available,

41:44.710 --> 41:47.672
if you're interested.

41:47.713 --> 41:49.341
- An internship.

41:47.713 --> 41:49.341
- Yeah.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.717
It'd be a good chance

41:49.382 --> 41:51.717
for you to get your feet wet

41:51.759 --> 41:53.928
experience how

41:51.759 --> 41:53.928
the real thing works.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.596
No.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.932
- Thank you.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.932
- "No, thank you?"

41:57.974 --> 42:01.311
I appreciate the offer. But no.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.858
[chuckles]

42:06.899 --> 42:09.568
May I be so bold

42:06.899 --> 42:09.568
as to inquire..

42:09.610 --> 42:11.570
[clears throat]

42:09.610 --> 42:11.570
...why the hell not?

42:13.114 --> 42:14.991
Because I have a feeling

42:15.033 --> 42:16.534
that the only reason

42:15.033 --> 42:16.534
you're doing this

42:16.575 --> 42:18.077
is because you feel guilty about

42:18.119 --> 42:19.787
what happened

42:18.119 --> 42:19.787
the other night at dinner.

42:19.829 --> 42:23.333
And it's very nice

42:19.829 --> 42:23.333
but very unnecessary.

42:25.335 --> 42:28.296
- So what?

42:25.335 --> 42:28.296
- Excuse me?

42:28.338 --> 42:30.923
Say the only reason I offered

42:28.338 --> 42:30.923
this to you is because my family

42:30.965 --> 42:33.176
behaved badly and I wanted

42:30.965 --> 42:33.176
to make up for it.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.470
Say I have no interest

42:33.218 --> 42:35.470
in furthering your career.

42:35.512 --> 42:37.389
This is still

42:35.512 --> 42:37.389
an opportunity.

42:37.430 --> 42:39.765
Who cares<i> why</i>

42:37.430 --> 42:39.765
you got the opportunity?

42:39.807 --> 42:41.726
It's here,

42:39.807 --> 42:41.726
and life is about

42:41.767 --> 42:43.769
making the most

42:41.767 --> 42:43.769
of everything you're handed.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.646
Well, this is

42:43.811 --> 42:45.646
being handed to you.

42:45.688 --> 42:47.940
Now, what are you

42:45.688 --> 42:47.940
gonna do about it?

42:51.610 --> 42:53.988
Monday, 10 o'clock.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.988
Call my office for the details.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.199
And bring a pencil.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.617
You never know

42:56.241 --> 42:58.617
when you're gonna need a pencil.
