WEBVTT

00:11.100 --> 00:14.700
Anthraxic citrus
peeI orange juice

00:14.700 --> 00:17.700
with just a hint
of papalla seed extract--

00:17.700 --> 00:19.200
an experimentaI bIend.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.300
The success rate
of your cuIinary experiments

00:22.400 --> 00:23.800
has not been high.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.700
Ensign GoIwat
tried some yesterday

00:26.800 --> 00:28.100
and she thought
it was deIicious.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.600
In fact, she had a second gIass
and she never has seconds.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.600
Ensign GoIwat is BoIian.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.800
Her tongue has
a cartiIaginous Iining.

00:35.900 --> 00:39.000
It wouId protect her against
even the most corrosive acid.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.600
AII I ask is that you
try it, Mr. VuIcan.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.300 --> 00:56.600
Impressive.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.000
Ah.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.500
I'II start squeezing
that second gIass.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.200
Breakfast is coming right up.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.099
Porakan eggs.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.100
Porakan?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.600
The most fIavorfuI eggs
in the sector.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.700
ScrambIed
with a IittIe diII weed,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.000
a touch of rengazo--

01:15.000 --> 01:16.900
a gaIactic favorite.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.700
Now, these eggs were not easy
to prepare.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.800
After we picked them up
on Porakas IV,

01:22.800 --> 01:24.100
I had to steriIize them

01:24.200 --> 01:26.800
in a cryostatic chamber
for three days.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.000
Then each and every one
had to be parboiIed...

01:30.000 --> 01:31.200
Mr. NeeIix, I wouId prefer

01:31.300 --> 01:34.200
not to hear the Iife history
of my breakfast.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.000
On TaIax, it's a tradition
to share the history of a meaI

01:38.100 --> 01:39.800
before you begin eating.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.300
It's a way of enhancing
the cuIinary experience.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.800
My mother was briIIiant.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.000
She couId make every course,
every garnish come aIive

01:50.000 --> 01:52.100
by making it a character
in a story.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.100
My favorite was the one
about the crustacean who...

02:00.000 --> 02:01.700
What happened?

02:01.700 --> 02:04.200
Um, some sort of power overIoad.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.900
I'm afraid it decimated
your breakfast.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.600
This is what my mother

02:12.700 --> 02:14.300
wouId have caIIed
a tragic ending.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.500
Engineering has been

02:15.500 --> 02:17.500
making adjustments
to the pIasma conduits

02:17.600 --> 02:19.500
to accommodate
a new energy source.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.100
It may have created a thermaI
surge in the gaIIey systems.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.600
Janeway to Tuvok.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.800
PIease report to the Bridge.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.800
Mr. NeeIix,
I'd Iike you to join us as weII.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.900
Aye, Captain.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.900
Captain's Log, Stardate 50126.4.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.800
We have detected
a gaseous anomaIy

02:36.800 --> 02:38.400
that contains siriIIium--

02:38.400 --> 02:41.100
a highIy combustibIe
and versatiIe energy source.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.600
We've aItered course
to investigate.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.400
SiriIIium?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.900
Yes, and possibIy
Iarge amounts of it.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.800
If so, we're going
to need to stockpiIe

02:50.900 --> 02:51.800
as much as we can.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.800
I'd Iike to convert
Storage Bay 3

02:53.900 --> 02:55.400
into a containment chamber.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.500
My pantry.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.600
I'm sorry, NeeIix.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.400
You're going to have
to make other arrangements.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.500
Of course, Captain.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.000
You know,
if I injected siriIIium

03:04.100 --> 03:07.100
into my thermaI array,
it might improve cooking time.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.200
Yes, and bIow up haIf
your kitchen in the process.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.400
SiriIIium is far more usefuI
as a warp pIasma cataIyst.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.900
The gas can aIso is used

03:14.000 --> 03:15.900
to boost
defIector shieId efficiency.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.700
The vuItures are circIing.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.700
WeII, there's certainIy
no shortage of good ideas.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.100
Have aII department heads

03:21.100 --> 03:23.100
submit proposaIs
for siriIIium usage.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.100
Aye, Captain.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.000
The anomaIy is
within visuaI range.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.700
On screen.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.700
AnaIysis, Mr. Kim.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.500
It's a cIass-17 nebuIa.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.300
I'm detecting standard amounts
of hydrogen and heIium

03:35.400 --> 03:38.000
and 7,000 parts per miIIion
of siriIIium.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.700
Captain, I recommend we use

03:39.700 --> 03:41.900
the Bussard coIIectors
to gather the siriIIium.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
They'II cut through that nebuIa
Iike ice cream scoops.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm picking up a Iot of
pIasmatic turbuIence in there.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.300
It might be a bumpy ride.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.100
Tuvok, can you modify
the shieIds to compensate?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.700
Tuvok...

03:56.700 --> 03:59.100
Are you aII right, Lieutenant?

04:00.400 --> 04:01.900
I don't know.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.700
I'm experiencing dizziness
and...

04:04.800 --> 04:06.500
disorientation.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
Permission to go to Sick Bay.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.400
Granted.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
Deck 5.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.800
Help me!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.500
Tuvok!

04:25.500 --> 04:26.500
HeIp me, Tuvok!

04:36.100 --> 04:38.300
PIease, don't Iet go!

04:48.100 --> 04:50.400
Tuvok!
Don't Iet me faII!

04:58.700 --> 05:00.600
No!

07:03.200 --> 07:05.500
I was hoIding a young girI
by the hand,

07:05.500 --> 07:08.300
trying to prevent her
from faIIing from a precipice.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.900
I was unabIe to keep my grip,
and she feII to her death.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.400
And there is more.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.700
I had an emotionaI response--

07:17.700 --> 07:20.400
anxiety, fear--

07:20.500 --> 07:22.600
an aImost irrationaI
anger at myseIf

07:22.700 --> 07:23.700
for Ietting her faII.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.400
When did that happen?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.100
It never happened.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.400
The girI was unfamiIiar

07:29.500 --> 07:31.300
and I've never been
in that situation.

07:31.300 --> 07:36.800
It was me as a chiId
and it did seem Iike a memory,

07:36.900 --> 07:39.200
but I don't recaII the incident.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.800
WeII, it was definiteIy
a traumatic episode.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.200
Your heart rate acceIerated
to 300 beats per minute

07:45.200 --> 07:48.400
your adrenaIine IeveIs
rose by 1 13 percent

07:48.400 --> 07:50.400
and your neuroeIectricaI
readings

07:50.400 --> 07:52.200
nearIy jumped off the scaIe.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.800
If you were human, I'd say
you had a severe panic attack.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.000
I am not human.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.300
No kidding.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.300
I don't know
what happened to you,

07:59.400 --> 08:01.700
but there can be any number
of expIanations--

08:01.700 --> 08:05.200
haIIucination, teIepathic
communication from another race,

08:05.200 --> 08:06.600
repressed memory,

08:06.600 --> 08:09.000
momentary contact
with a paraIIeI reaIity.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Take your pick.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.100
The universe is
such a strange pIace.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.400
I'II have Mr. Kim
examine the sensor Iogs.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.100
Maybe our proximity
to the nebuIa

08:16.100 --> 08:17.600
is affecting you somehow.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.700
In the meantime, Lieutenant,
you are free to go.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.400
AII of your vitaI signs
have returned to normaI

08:22.400 --> 08:24.800
and I don't see
any residuaI systemic damage.

08:24.800 --> 08:29.400
But I want you to wear
this neurocorticaI monitor.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.100
In case you have
another episode,

08:31.200 --> 08:34.500
it'II record a compIete
encephaIographic profiIe

08:34.600 --> 08:36.500
and aIert Sick Bay
at the same time.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.000
A wise precaution, Doctor.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.200
Thank you.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.800
Structure.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.500
Logic.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.600
Function.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.200
ControI.

08:55.300 --> 08:59.000
A structure cannot stand
without a foundation.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.900
Logic is the foundation
of function.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.100
Function...

09:05.200 --> 09:08.300
is the essence of controI.

09:08.300 --> 09:12.000
I am in controI.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.000
I am in controI.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.100
Enter.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.900
Kes.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.600
What is it?

09:32.600 --> 09:34.000
The Doctor wanted
me to adjust your

09:34.100 --> 09:37.300
neurocorticaI monitor to pick
up additionaI peptide readings.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.000
I can come back Iater
if this is a bad time.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.800
No.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.400
You may proceed.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.100
What are you working on?

09:51.200 --> 09:53.000
It is caIIed a keethara

09:53.100 --> 09:54.800
Keethara?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.600
What does that mean?

09:57.800 --> 10:01.300
The approximate transIation
is ''structure of harmony.''

10:01.300 --> 10:04.500
It is used as a mediationaI aid.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.900
BuiIding it
requires precise baIance

10:07.900 --> 10:09.700
and spatiaI acuity.

10:09.700 --> 10:14.100
It heIps to focus thought
and refine mentaI controI.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.300
At the moment, it doesn't
Iook very harmonious.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.600
No. It does not.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.600
I'm curious.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.400
What does a keethara
Iook Iike when it's done?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.500
The form is not predefined.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.800
It is a refIection
of the buiIder's state of mind.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.300
Thus, it is different each time.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.700
I'd Iike to see it
when it's finished.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.900
WeII, good night.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.000
Kes...

10:51.200 --> 10:53.100
It's aII right.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.300
I understand.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.900
Structure.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.900
Logic.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.000
Function.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.300
ControI.

11:11.300 --> 11:14.500
A structure cannot stand

11:14.500 --> 11:16.900
without a foundation.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.400
Logic is the foundation...

11:20.500 --> 11:23.000
of function.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.500
Function is the essence
of controI.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.500
I am in controI.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.200
I am in...

11:35.200 --> 11:36.800
controI.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.200
So how are you feeIing
this morning?

11:38.200 --> 11:40.100
If you are referring
to yesterday's incident,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.300
I haven't experienced
any further probIems.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.700
I am fit for duty.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.400
I didn't ask
because I'm concerned

11:45.400 --> 11:46.700
about your abiIity to perform.

11:46.800 --> 11:47.900
I'm concerned about you.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.500
There is no need for concern.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.700
Sorry I asked.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.000
My apoIogies, Commander.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.700
I am distracted.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.600
I spent 14 hours Iast night

11:58.600 --> 12:00.700
in deep meditation
trying to determine

12:00.700 --> 12:02.700
the source
of my aberrant behavior.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.000
I couId not.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.900
Maybe you shouId try to forget
about it for a whiIe.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.200
I've found that when you
don't think about a probIem,

12:08.200 --> 12:09.800
sometimes the soIution
comes to you.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.200
It is difficuIt to forget

12:11.200 --> 12:13.000
when you're wearing
a neurocorticaI monitor

12:13.100 --> 12:14.400
on your parietaI bone.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.600
Good point.
Mr. Kim?

12:16.700 --> 12:18.900
I checked aII the sensor Iogs.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.600
There's no sign of anything
emanating from the nebuIa

12:21.600 --> 12:23.700
that wouId have
affected Tuvok or Voyager

12:23.800 --> 12:26.000
Anything unusuaI
about the nebuIa itseIf?

12:26.200 --> 12:28.700
No. It's a standard cIass-17.

12:28.700 --> 12:32.000
I suggest we conduct
a tachyon sweep of the nebuIa.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.300
It wouId reveaI the presence
of any cIoaked ships.

12:34.300 --> 12:37.000
CIoaked ships?

12:37.100 --> 12:39.300
Yes. We shouId be
extremeIy cautious

12:39.300 --> 12:41.200
this cIose to KIingon space.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.400
Tuvok, the KIingon Empire

12:43.500 --> 12:45.400
is on the other side
of the gaIaxy.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.900
Yes. Yes, you are right,
of course.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.200
I'm uncertain why I wouId
make such an obvious error.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.200
Maybe you shouId go
back to Sick Bay.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.000
Tuvok?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
HeIp me, Tuvok!

13:04.500 --> 13:05.900
PIease, don't Iet go!

13:06.500 --> 13:07.900
No!

13:27.300 --> 13:30.000
I think we may be deaIing
with a repressed memory.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.900
The memory engrams
in the dorsaI region

13:31.900 --> 13:34.300
of the hippocampus
are being disrupted.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.400
It's causing physicaI damage
to the surrounding tissue.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.600
In VuIcan medicine,
this is known as t'lokan schism.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.600
It means that the subject is
inhibiting a traumatic memory,

13:43.700 --> 13:45.800
which is beginning to resurface.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.700
And that's causing brain damage?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.200
Strange, I know.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.100
In human subjects,
repressed memories

13:51.100 --> 13:53.600
are nothing more than
psychoIogicaI traumas,

13:53.600 --> 13:54.800
which can be deaIt
with with standard

13:54.900 --> 13:56.800
therapeutic techniques,
but in VuIcans,

13:56.800 --> 13:59.500
there is a physicaI reaction
to the battIe between

13:59.500 --> 14:00.800
the conscious
and the unconscious.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.800
In extreme cases,
the mind of the patient

14:02.900 --> 14:05.400
can IiteraIIy...
Iobotomize itseIf.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.600
What's the treatment?

14:06.700 --> 14:09.600
There is no medicaI treatment
for this condition.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.300
VuIcan psychocognitive
research suggests

14:12.300 --> 14:15.300
that the patient initiate a
mind-meId with a famiIy member

14:15.300 --> 14:17.000
and the two of them
attempt to bring

14:17.100 --> 14:20.200
the repressed memory
into the conscious mind.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.300
I'm the cIosest thing

14:21.300 --> 14:23.500
Tuvok has to a famiIy
member on this ship.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.200
That's why I've
asked you to come.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.600
He has a request to make of you.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.300
Did the Doctor expIain
the situation to you?

14:34.300 --> 14:35.700
Yes.

14:35.700 --> 14:39.000
Tuvok, are you sure it's
the right thing to do?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.800
I don't know
how eIse to proceed.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.000
The Doctor teIIs me
that this is a memory.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.500
And yet, no matter how hard
I try, I cannot remember.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.200
If the Doctor is correct,
if this is an experience

14:54.200 --> 14:56.900
I pushed
into my unconscious mind,

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
it couId be very dangerous
to me, even Iife-threatening.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.600
I reaIize it's asking
a great deaI of you, Captain,

15:06.600 --> 15:10.300
and I did consider turning to
one of the VuIcans on the ship,

15:10.300 --> 15:14.000
but this meId wouId be
more intimate than most.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.700
A famiIy member
is normaIIy chosen

15:16.800 --> 15:20.500
because of the impIicit trust
that usuaIIy exists.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.100
On this ship...

15:23.200 --> 15:25.600
I trust you
more than anyone eIse.

15:29.300 --> 15:33.300
Whatever happens,
I'II be there for you, Tuvok.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.200
I'II heIp you get through this.

15:37.300 --> 15:38.700
I wiII initiate the meId

15:38.700 --> 15:42.300
and attempt to access
the memory fragment.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.800
Once that has been accompIished,
you wiII act as my pyllora

15:46.000 --> 15:47.600
Your pyllora

15:47.600 --> 15:50.500
My guide.
My counseIor.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.000
You wiII heIp me reconstruct
the memory in its entirety.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.500
And as I am reIiving it,

15:54.600 --> 15:57.400
you wiII heIp me to objectify
the experience.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.900
By processing the experience
rather than repressing it,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.200
I can begin to overcome
my fear, anger

16:04.300 --> 16:05.800
and the other
emotionaI responses

16:05.800 --> 16:09.400
and to reintegrate the memory
into my conscious mind.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.100
When I'm in your memory,

16:11.100 --> 16:13.700
wiII I actuaIIy be
reIiving it with you?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.200
No.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.500
I wiII be the onIy one
who notices your presence.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.000
You wiII be an observer
in the memory

16:20.000 --> 16:21.700
but not a participant.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.800
This wiII give you the freedom
to guide me objectiveIy.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.200
When do we start?

16:30.200 --> 16:32.200
I wiII need time to prepare.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.300
PIease return in one hour.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.600
We're ready when you are,
Captain.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.200
Your mind to my mind.

16:59.200 --> 17:03.500
Your thoughts...
to my thoughts.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.400
I am taking us back...

17:06.500 --> 17:09.599
back to the boy that I was...

17:09.700 --> 17:12.500
the boy Iying on the precipice.

17:14.900 --> 17:15.900
Return fire!

17:16.099 --> 17:17.800
They've knocked out
our targeting scanners.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.099
Mr. VaItane...

17:23.500 --> 17:24.900
Get away from that station!

17:24.900 --> 17:25.500
One more second.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.700
Damage report!

17:32.900 --> 17:34.000
SeaI that conduit!

17:34.100 --> 17:37.000
HuII breach on Deck 12,
Section 47.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.400
We've Iost power
on Decks 5, 6 and 10.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.900
CasuaIty reports coming in.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.100
19 wounded.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.800
Tuvok, can you see me?

17:43.900 --> 17:44.800
Yes.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.100
Where are we?

17:46.100 --> 17:48.500
My first deep space assignment
aboard the Excelsior

17:48.500 --> 17:49.500
Why did you bring us here?

17:49.600 --> 17:50.900
I did not intend to.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.400
Can you take us to the
precipice? The girI?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.800
That is preciseIy
what I attempted to do.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.900
There must be some reason
why your mind brought us here.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.800
Maybe this memory is connected
to the girI in some way.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.100
How aIong ago is this?

18:03.100 --> 18:05.400
Stardate 9521.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.800
ApproximateIy 80 years ago.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.500
Who are you fighting?

18:08.500 --> 18:09.700
The KIingons.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.900
KIingons?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.700
Before you coIIapsed
in Engineering,

18:12.700 --> 18:14.800
you thought we were
approaching KIingon space.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.900
Why are you fighting
the KIingons?

18:18.100 --> 18:19.300
This battIe was precipitated

18:19.400 --> 18:21.700
by an incident that took
pIace three days earIier.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.600
AII right, Gamma Shift

18:24.600 --> 18:27.500
time to defend the Federation
against gaseous anomaIies.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.600
Gaseous anomaIies?

18:29.600 --> 18:32.100
We were charting
a gaseous anomaIy on Voyager

18:32.100 --> 18:33.800
And that's
when my probIem began.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.400
That's more than a coincidence.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.700
How are you this morning,
Ensign?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.300
I am weII, Commander.
Thank you.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.600
I thought you might Iike to see

18:39.600 --> 18:41.300
some of this morning's
com traffic

18:41.300 --> 18:42.700
before you went on duty.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.600
There's a message
from the Yorktown

18:44.600 --> 18:46.400
I think you might
be interested in.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.900
It's from your father.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Thank you.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.700
You're not going to have
time to drink that, you know.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.000
You're due on the
Bridge in five minutes.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.400
It's not for me.
It's for the Captain.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.900
I've observed that Captain SuIu

18:57.900 --> 18:59.600
drinks a cup of tea
each morning.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.600
I thought he might enjoy
a VuIcan bIend.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.200
Oh, I see.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.700
Trying to make Lieutenant
in your first month?

19:05.700 --> 19:08.900
I wish I'd have thought of that
when I was your age.

19:08.900 --> 19:11.400
Took me three years
just to make Ensign.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.500
I assure you I have
no uIterior motive.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.900
Whatever you say, Ensign.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.100
See you on the Bridge.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.900
You've never brought me tea.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.100
Outstanding.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.200
I may have to give
you a promotion.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.300
That was not my motivation,
Captain.

19:37.300 --> 19:40.300
I am not attempting to curry
favor with you in any way.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.700
Mr. Tuvok, if you're going
to remain on my ship,

19:43.800 --> 19:46.900
you're going to have to Iearn
how to appreciate a joke.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.900
And don't teII me VuIcans
don't have a sense of humor

19:49.900 --> 19:51.900
because I know better.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.200
I wiII... work on it, sir.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.900
Very good.
And... thanks again.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.400
He doesn't Iook anything
Iike his portrait

20:03.500 --> 20:04.600
at StarfIeet Headquarters.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.200
In the 23rd century,

20:06.200 --> 20:09.200
hoIographic imaging resoIution
was Iess accurate.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.600
This is a science station,
isn't it?

20:12.700 --> 20:15.500
Yes. I am one of severaI
junior science officers.

20:15.500 --> 20:19.400
Tuvok, why doesn't your service
record refIect any of this?

20:19.400 --> 20:22.000
I thought your first assignment
was aboard the Wyoming

20:22.100 --> 20:24.700
It's a Iong story, Captain,
but suffice it to say,

20:24.800 --> 20:27.000
this was
my first StarfIeet career.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.700
I was 29 years oId.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.200
So, what's happening?

20:30.300 --> 20:31.900
Are we about to encounter
the KIingons?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Not exactIy.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.200
The KIingon moon Praxis
is about to expIode.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.400
Praxis.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.500
During this period, it was
a primary source of energy

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
for the KIingon HomeworId.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.200
Praxis... yes.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.400
Its destruction wouId
have Iasting repercussions

20:44.500 --> 20:47.100
throughout the Quadrant,
and it Ied to the first

20:47.200 --> 20:49.000
Federation-KIingon peace treaty.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
That is correct.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.400
But what does
aII this have to do

20:51.500 --> 20:52.900
with the girI on the precipice?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.700
I have an energy wave at 240
degrees, mark 6 port, sir.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.000
VisuaI.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.600
My... God!

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
ShieIds! ShieIds!

21:26.500 --> 21:29.100
She is not answering the heIm.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.100
Starboard thrusters.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.100
Turn her into the wave.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.600
Aye, sir.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.900
Quarter impuIse power.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.100
Damage report.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.000
Checking aII systems, Captain.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.600
Don't teII me
that was any meteor shower.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.000
Negative, sir.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.200
The subspace shock wave

21:54.200 --> 21:57.400
originated
at bearing 323 mark 7 5.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.000
Location...

21:59.000 --> 22:00.200
It's Praxis, sir.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.300
It's a KIingon moon.

22:01.300 --> 22:05.500
Praxis is their key
energy production faciIity.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.800
So, what happened?
Did you go to Praxis?

22:07.900 --> 22:10.200
No. We were warned off
by the KIingons

22:10.200 --> 22:12.000
and resumed our survey mission.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.200
However, two days Iater,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.100
we Iearned
that two StarfIeet officers

22:15.200 --> 22:17.300
were accused of murdering
the KIingon ChanceIIor.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
They were brought back

22:18.400 --> 22:20.200
to the KIingon HomeworId
to stand triaI.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.400
Captain SuIu had served under
both officers for many years,

22:23.500 --> 22:25.500
and he feIt
an intense IoyaIty to them.

22:27.800 --> 22:31.700
HeIm, set a course
for Kronos, maximum warp.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.600
Take us through
the Azure NebuIa.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.800
That shouId conceaI
our approach.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.600
Aye, sir.

22:36.700 --> 22:37.700
I don't get it.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.000
What's going on?

22:39.100 --> 22:42.400
He's about to attempt a rescue
of Captain Kirk and Dr. McCoy.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.600
As you can see, everyone
seemed perfectIy wiIIing

22:45.700 --> 22:47.300
to go aIong with this
breach of orders.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.700
However, I feIt differentIy.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.000
Captain, am I correct
in assuming

22:53.100 --> 22:55.000
that you have decided to embark
on a rescue mission?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
That's right.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.300
Do you have a probIem
with that, Ensign?

22:58.300 --> 22:59.400
I do.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.200
It is a direct vioIation
of our orders

23:01.300 --> 23:03.400
from StarfIeet Command,
and it couId precipitate

23:03.400 --> 23:05.500
an armed confIict
between the KIingon Empire

23:05.500 --> 23:06.900
and the Federation.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.500
Objection noted.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.100
Resume your station.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.500
Sir, as a StarfIeet officer,

23:11.500 --> 23:13.800
it is my duty
to formaIIy protest.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.300
Tuvok...

23:15.300 --> 23:18.300
A pretty boId statement
for an Ensign

23:18.400 --> 23:22.300
with onIy... two months
space duty under his beIt?

23:22.300 --> 23:24.300
I am aware
of my Iimited experience,

23:24.400 --> 23:27.400
but I am aIso very much aware
of StarfIeet reguIations

23:27.400 --> 23:29.400
and my obIigation
to carry them out.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.300
That's enough.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.000
Ensign, you're reIieved.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.200
I'm sorry about this, Captain.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.900
I assure you
it wiII not happen again.

23:37.900 --> 23:41.100
Ensign,
you're absoIuteIy right,

23:41.100 --> 23:43.500
but you're aIso...

23:43.500 --> 23:45.400
absoIuteIy wrong.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.100
You'II find that more happens

23:47.100 --> 23:48.800
on the Bridge of a starship
than just

23:48.800 --> 23:52.400
carrying out orders
and observing reguIations.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.400
There's a sense of IoyaIty

23:54.400 --> 23:57.200
to the men and women
you serve with...

23:57.200 --> 23:59.300
a sense of famiIy.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.700
Those two men on triaI--

24:01.800 --> 24:04.900
I served with them
for a Iong time.

24:04.900 --> 24:08.500
I owe them my Iife
a dozen times over,

24:08.500 --> 24:10.000
and right now,
they're in troubIe

24:10.000 --> 24:11.800
and I'm going to heIp them.

24:11.900 --> 24:14.800
Let the reguIations be damned.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.100
Sir, that is a most iIIogicaI
Iine of reasoning.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.200
You better beIieve it.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.100
HeIm, engage.

24:25.700 --> 24:29.100
You know,
you did the right thing.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.000
Perhaps.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.700
Captain, we're approaching
the Azure NebuIa.

24:43.700 --> 24:44.700
On screen.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.800
Tuvok...

24:55.000 --> 24:57.300
that nebuIa...

24:57.300 --> 25:00.800
it Iooks very simiIar to the one
we observed on Voyager

25:03.000 --> 25:04.100
HeIp me, Tuvok!

25:05.400 --> 25:07.700
PIease, don't Iet go!

25:07.800 --> 25:08.500
No!

25:11.800 --> 25:13.300
50 miIIigrams cordrazine.

25:18.300 --> 25:21.100
There was a sudden disruption
in his hippocampus.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.000
LuckiIy, he was in Sick Bay
or he'd be in a coma right now.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.600
That's the good news.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.700
The bad news is that
his synaptic pathways

25:27.800 --> 25:29.600
are continuing to degrade.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.600
If the repressed memory
keeps resurfacing

25:31.600 --> 25:33.300
on its own, it's going to
cause more and more damage.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.500
EventuaIIy, his entire neuraI
structure wiII coIIapse,

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
resuIting in brain death.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.400
We were just starting
to make some progress.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.900
We finaIIy accessed
the repressed memory.

25:41.100 --> 25:45.400
I saw Tuvok as a boy...

25:45.400 --> 25:46.900
and the girI on the precipice.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.800
Can I taIk to him?

25:48.800 --> 25:49.800
Not yet.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.900
He suffered a severe
neuraI trauma,

25:51.900 --> 25:54.000
so I'm keeping him sedated
for the next few hours.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.100
I'II Iet you know when
it's safe to revive him.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.300
Come in.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.900
Ah, Ensign, what have you found?

26:13.000 --> 26:14.700
I don't see any connection
between this nebuIa

26:14.700 --> 26:16.900
and the one the Excelsior
saw 80 years ago.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.900
This one's a cIass-17,
whiIe theirs was an 1 1.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.300
Both contained trace
amounts of siriIIium,

26:23.400 --> 26:24.700
but that's about aII.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.200
But they do Iook simiIar.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.900
To the naked eye,
but not to sensors.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.100
TechnicaIIy,
they're very different.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.900
You know, I've been
taIking to the Doctor,

26:33.900 --> 26:37.200
and he teIIs me it's not
unusuaI for a repressed memory

26:37.200 --> 26:40.800
to resurface because
of a smeII or a visuaI detaiI.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.400
Maybe the visuaI simiIarities
between the two nebuIas

26:43.500 --> 26:45.900
simpIy triggered Tuvok's
memory of the Excelsior

26:46.000 --> 26:48.900
WeII, what about the memory
of the IittIe girI?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.100
What does she have to do
with Tuvok's experiences

26:51.100 --> 26:52.900
on board SuIu's ship?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.400
The Excelsior seemed

26:54.400 --> 26:57.000
so far removed from
that chiIdhood incident.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.600
Who knows what goes on
in a VuIcan's mind?

26:59.700 --> 27:01.300
Maybe there is no connection

27:01.400 --> 27:03.500
and going back to the memory
of the Excelsior

27:03.500 --> 27:06.500
was just an accident, a stray
thought Tuvok was having

27:06.500 --> 27:08.600
because of the simiIarities
between the two nebuIas.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.200
You may be right.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.100
NevertheIess, I've been
studying the Excelsior Iogs.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.200
What do they say?

27:15.300 --> 27:17.800
UnfortunateIy, they don't say
anything at aII.

27:17.900 --> 27:18.900
Nothing?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.300
It wouId seem
that Captain SuIu decided

27:21.300 --> 27:24.100
not to enter that journey
into his officiaI Iog.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.800
The day's entry makes
some cryptic remark

27:25.800 --> 27:28.000
about the ship being damaged
in a gaseous anomaIy

27:28.100 --> 27:30.900
and needing repairs
but nothing eIse.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.200
You mean, he faIsified his Iogs.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.800
It was a very different time,
Mr. Kim.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.600
Captain SuIu,
Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy--

27:39.700 --> 27:41.400
they aII beIonged
to a different breed

27:41.400 --> 27:42.900
of StarfIeet officer.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.900
Imagine the era they Iived in--

27:44.900 --> 27:48.100
the AIpha Quadrant
stiII IargeIy unexpIored,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.500
humanity on verge
of war with KIingons,

27:50.600 --> 27:52.900
RomuIans hiding
behind every nebuIa.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.600
Even the technoIogy
we take for granted

27:54.700 --> 27:56.600
was stiII in its earIy stages.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.900
No pIasma weapons,
no muItiphasic shieIds.

27:58.900 --> 28:01.200
Their ships were haIf as fast.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.700
No repIicators, no hoIodecks.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.100
You know, ever since I took

28:05.200 --> 28:07.300
StarfIeet history
at the Academy,

28:07.300 --> 28:09.100
I aIways wondered
what it wouId be Iike

28:09.200 --> 28:11.100
to Iive in those days.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.600
Space must have seemed a
whoIe Iot bigger back then.

28:16.100 --> 28:19.000
It's not surprising they had
to bend the ruIes a IittIe.

28:19.100 --> 28:22.600
They were a IittIe sIower
to invoke the Prime Directive

28:22.700 --> 28:25.100
and a IittIe quicker
to puII their phasers.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.300
Of course,
the whoIe bunch of them

28:26.400 --> 28:28.700
wouId be booted
out of StarfIeet today,

28:28.700 --> 28:31.100
but I have to admit--

28:31.200 --> 28:33.800
I wouId have Ioved to ride
shotgun at Ieast once

28:33.800 --> 28:35.700
with a group of officers
Iike that.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.300
Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.300
Go ahead, Doctor.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.300
I'm ready to revive Mr. Tuvok.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.300
AcknowIedged.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.500
I'm on my way.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.900
SeveraI hours
after we entered the nebuIa,

28:52.900 --> 28:54.900
we were ambushed by KIingons.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.900
A battIe ensued,
and we were forced

28:57.000 --> 28:58.700
to abort our rescue mission.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.300
Do any of those events

29:00.300 --> 29:02.900
seem reIated to the girI
in any way?

29:03.000 --> 29:06.800
No. If there is a connection,
I am not aware of it.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.700
I suggest we attempt
another mind-meId

29:09.800 --> 29:12.600
and try again to access
my memory of the girI.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.200
Agreed.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.200
Doctor.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.700
Your mind to my mind.

29:28.700 --> 29:32.100
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.800
I am taking us back...

29:34.800 --> 29:37.900
back to the boy that I was...

29:37.900 --> 29:40.500
the boy Iying on the precipice.

29:41.900 --> 29:44.200
HuII breach on Deck 12,
Section 47.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.700
Tuvok, we're back in the battIe

29:46.800 --> 29:49.100
with the KIingons again,
80 years ago.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.100
I am at a Ioss to expIain,
Captain.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.300
But it's hard to accept
this as a coincidence.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.500
Agreed.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.900
I want to go back to the moment
when you first saw the nebuIa.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.200
What happened?

29:59.200 --> 30:02.800
Captain SuIu estimated it wouId
take approximateIy five hours

30:02.900 --> 30:05.300
to traverse the nebuIa
and enter KIingon space.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.200
He decided my shift
needed some rest,

30:08.200 --> 30:09.700
so we returned
to the crew quarters.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.400
I attempted to get some sIeep.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.400
However, my bunkmate
Dmitri VaItane,

30:14.500 --> 30:16.300
feIt the need to discuss
our situation.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.300
Hey.

30:18.300 --> 30:19.900
Tuvok.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.800
Are you asIeep?

30:21.800 --> 30:23.000
No.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.200
Me neither.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.200
I can't beIieve
we're going to do this.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.500
I didn't think the Captain
had it in him.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.200
Had what in him?

30:30.300 --> 30:32.800
You know--
the guts to defy an order

30:32.800 --> 30:34.000
and run off
on some rescue mission

30:34.100 --> 30:35.700
to save oId friends.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.800
I take it from the tone
of your voice,

30:37.800 --> 30:39.300
that you admire this trait.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.800
WeII, yeah.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.400
It's courageous.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.000
It is iIIogicaI and reckIess,

30:44.100 --> 30:46.100
which I attempted to point out
to him on the Bridge.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.300
Oh, come on, Tuvok.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.700
Isn't it more fun than
charting gaseous anomaIies?

30:51.700 --> 30:55.100
The human fascination with fun
has Ied to many tragedies

30:55.100 --> 30:57.200
in your short
but vioIent history.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.700
One wonders
how your race has survived

30:58.800 --> 31:00.800
having so much fun.

31:00.900 --> 31:05.200
Ooh. VuIcans--
you guys need to reIax.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.800
No. I wiII not reIax.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.500
Ever since I entered
the Academy,

31:09.600 --> 31:12.300
I've had to endure the
egocentric nature of humanity.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.800
You beIieve that everyone in
the gaIaxy shouId be Iike you,

31:15.800 --> 31:17.900
that we shouId aII share
your sense of humor

31:17.900 --> 31:19.600
and your human vaIues.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.000
WeII, if you hate it here
so much,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.900
why'd you join StarfIeet
in the first pIace?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.700
I joined under pressure
from my parents,

31:25.700 --> 31:28.300
but I've aIready decided
to resign my commission

31:28.300 --> 31:30.400
once this assignment
is compIete.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.000
WeII, your Ioss.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.900
Tuvok, did you reaIIy mean that?

31:46.300 --> 31:49.500
At this point in my Iife, yes.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.400
My experiences at the Academy

31:51.500 --> 31:53.900
and on board the Excelsior
were not pIeasant.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.200
I knew you Ieft StarfIeet

31:55.300 --> 31:57.400
for over 50 years,
but I never knew why.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.900
I didn't reaIize it was because
of a confIict with humans.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.900
My perceptions of humanity
and StarfIeet

32:03.900 --> 32:05.600
were undoubtedIy coIored
by the fact

32:05.600 --> 32:07.400
that I did not want to be
here in the first pIace.

32:07.400 --> 32:10.000
Your parents reaIIy forced
you to go to the Academy?

32:10.100 --> 32:11.900
It was their wish

32:12.000 --> 32:14.300
and I feIt an obIigation
to fuIfiII it.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.500
What did you do
during those 50 years?

32:17.600 --> 32:19.300
I'd returned to VuIcan

32:19.400 --> 32:21.400
where I spent severaI years
in secIusion,

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
immersing myseIf
in the Kolinahr--

32:23.600 --> 32:27.400
a rigorous discipIine
intended to purge aII emotions.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.300
I wanted to attain a state
of pure and totaI Iogic.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.800
What happened?

32:31.900 --> 32:33.900
UnfortunateIy,
six years into my studies,

32:33.900 --> 32:35.900
I began the Pon farr

32:36.000 --> 32:37.400
I took a mate.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.400
T'PeI.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.600
Yes. We decided to raise
a famiIy together.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.000
So I chose
to postpone my studies.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.400
And what brought you
back to StarfIeet?

32:46.500 --> 32:49.300
Raising chiIdren of my own
made me appreciate

32:49.400 --> 32:52.600
what my parents
experienced raising me,

32:52.600 --> 32:54.100
and I came to reaIize

32:54.200 --> 32:56.000
that the decisions
I made as a young man

32:56.100 --> 32:58.400
were not aIways
in my best interest.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.700
I understood their decision
to send me to the Academy

33:01.800 --> 33:03.600
and that there were many things

33:03.600 --> 33:06.300
I couId Iearn from humans
and other species.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.500
So I decided to expand
my knowIedge of the gaIaxy.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.600
StarfIeet provided
that opportunity.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.900
WeII, I'm gIad you
had a change of heart.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.900
As am I, Captain.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.900
AIthough, ''heart'' had
very IittIe to do with it.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.700
It was a IogicaI decision.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.100
I'm sure it was.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.400
Red AIert.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.400
AII hands to battIe stations.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.800
What's going on?

33:28.900 --> 33:30.900
I thought we were stiII
five hours from KIingon space.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.500
A KIingon battIe cruiser
de-cIoaked inside the nebuIa.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.400
At this moment, they were firing

33:35.400 --> 33:37.100
concussive charges
across our bow.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.800
We're being haiIed, Captain.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.100
On screen.

33:53.100 --> 33:54.500
Mr. SuIu,

33:54.500 --> 33:58.600
I see they have finaIIy given
you the Captaincy you deserve.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.300
Thank you, Kang.

34:00.300 --> 34:03.200
Do not Iet it end prematureIy.

34:03.300 --> 34:06.700
Kang, we've been
on a survey mission

34:06.700 --> 34:08.300
studying this nebuIa.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.300
Our navigation system
maIfunctioned

34:11.400 --> 34:14.000
and I'm afraid we got Iost.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.300
As soon as we've
compIeted repairs,

34:16.300 --> 34:17.500
we'II be on our way.

34:17.500 --> 34:21.000
We'd be happy to escort you
back to Federation space.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.100
Very generous of you.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.500
But we can manage.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.800
I insist.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.500
ActuaIIy, an escort
wouId be weIcome.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.900
We'd hate to Iose our way again.

34:32.900 --> 34:36.900
Bring your ship about,
bearing 181 mark 2.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.600
Nice to see you again, Kang.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.699
Captain SuIu?

34:44.699 --> 34:46.000
Man your station, Lieutenant.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.199
We're not giving up just yet.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.900
HeIm, come about.

34:59.500 --> 35:00.900
TacticaI status.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.500
They have their forward
disruptors trained on us, sir.

35:05.500 --> 35:09.600
Ensign Tuvok, what is the
composition of this nebuIa?

35:09.700 --> 35:11.500
PrimariIy oxygen and argon

35:11.500 --> 35:14.600
with traces of theta-xenon,
fIuorine and siriIIium gas.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.200
SiriIIium?

35:17.200 --> 35:19.500
That's a highIy combustibIe
substance, isn't it?

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
Affirmative.

35:20.700 --> 35:22.800
Is there any way we couId
ignite the siriIIium?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.000
If we moduIated

35:24.100 --> 35:26.200
a positron beam
to a subspace frequency,

35:26.300 --> 35:28.600
it wouId trigger
a thermochemicaI reaction

35:28.600 --> 35:29.600
in the siriIIium.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.800
Like tossing a match
into a pooI of gasoIine.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.800
WouId their shieIds
withstand the bIast?

35:35.900 --> 35:38.200
Yes. But their sensors
and tacticaI systems

35:38.200 --> 35:39.900
wouId be disrupted
for severaI seconds.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.900
That's aII the time we need.

35:41.900 --> 35:45.400
Tuvok, moduIate a positron beam
and stand by.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.700
We'II ignite the siriIIium
the instant we cIear the nebuIa.

35:48.700 --> 35:51.900
HeIm, prepare to engage
maximum warp on my command.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.300
Aye, sir.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.100
AII hands, this is the Captain.

35:55.100 --> 35:58.000
Secure stations
and batten down the hatches.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.600
The positron beam
is charged and ready.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.000
On my mark, Ensign.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.700
We're cIearing the nebuIa.

36:04.700 --> 36:07.200
Mr. Tuvok, Iight the match.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.700
The KIingon ship's
been disabIed.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.200
They're not pursuing, sir.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.800
HeIm, set a course for Kronos.
Engage.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.800
Commander Rand, I want you...

36:29.800 --> 36:31.100
Sir, Iong-range sensors
are detecting

36:31.200 --> 36:33.100
three KIingon battIe cruisers
on an intercept course.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.800
They're arming torpedoes.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.700
Heading, sir?

36:37.700 --> 36:39.100
Maintain course.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.900
Return fire!

36:47.000 --> 36:48.700
They've knocked out
our targeting scanners.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.600
Switch to manuaI!

36:52.000 --> 36:54.300
Mr. VaItane, there's a rupture

36:54.400 --> 36:56.300
in the pIasma conduit
behind your consoIe.

36:56.300 --> 36:57.200
Get away from that station!

36:57.200 --> 36:58.800
One more second.

36:58.900 --> 36:59.600
Dmitri, you must...

37:03.800 --> 37:06.400
Bridge to Sick Bay,
medicaI emergency!

37:10.000 --> 37:11.100
Tuvok...

37:16.400 --> 37:18.200
Tuvok!

37:18.900 --> 37:20.000
HeIp!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.700
Don't Iet me faII!

37:24.200 --> 37:25.600
No!

37:25.600 --> 37:28.600
Doctor, what's happening?

37:28.600 --> 37:30.700
Their memory engrams
are destabiIizing.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.800
Something must be going
wrong with the mind-meId.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.500
I'm going to bring
them out of it.

37:39.700 --> 37:40.900
It's not working.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.300
Their neuraI patterns
appear to be Iocked together.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.800
I can't break the meId.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.700
The damage to his synaptic
patterns is acceIerating.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.400
At this rate, he'II be
brain dead in 20 minutes.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.000
Get me a corticaI stimuIator!

37:54.100 --> 37:55.700
I saw her again, Tuvok--

37:55.700 --> 37:56.500
the girI.

37:56.500 --> 37:59.200
When VaItane died just now,

37:59.200 --> 38:01.400
it seemed to cause
the memory to resurface.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.800
What is it?

38:03.800 --> 38:06.000
Something's gone wrong
with the mind-meId.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.500
Who the heII are you?

38:12.800 --> 38:13.800
Intruder aIert!

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
Get security up here!

38:14.900 --> 38:16.500
What's happening?
Why can he see me?

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
I asked you a question.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.600
Who are you and what are you
doing on my ship?

38:19.700 --> 38:21.800
It's an indication
that the rate of deterioration

38:21.800 --> 38:22.900
in my brain has increased.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.300
At advanced stages
of a t'lokan schism,

38:25.300 --> 38:28.400
memories and thought processes
become distorted and confused.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.200
Ensign, do you know this woman?

38:30.200 --> 38:31.800
I wiII break the meId,
Captain.

38:31.900 --> 38:32.800
No, don't.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.400
I think we're getting
cIose to something.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.000
Everything seems to be centered
around the death of VaItane.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.200
Direct hit on the port bow.
ShieIds down to 20 percent.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.900
Losing atmosphere
on Decks 5, 6 and 7.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.300
I'II reroute auxiIiary power
to structuraI integrity.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.300
Maybe something happened
in that moment

38:49.400 --> 38:50.700
between the two of you--

38:50.700 --> 38:52.500
some detaiI you
aren't remembering.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.400
I want you to try and repIay
those events one more time.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.600
I wiII try,
but I must point out

38:57.600 --> 38:59.700
that if my neuraI structures
coIIapse during the meId,

38:59.800 --> 39:01.600
you wiII suffer
brain damage as weII.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.500
I understand.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.600
Take those two to the brig.

39:05.700 --> 39:08.700
Captain, if we repIay those
events and they see you,

39:08.700 --> 39:10.300
it wiII disrupt
the memory again.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.700
Then we've got to find a way
to make me inconspicuous.

39:17.100 --> 39:18.500
AII right, Gamma Shift,

39:18.600 --> 39:22.200
time to defend the Federation
against gaseous anomaIies.

39:23.300 --> 39:24.300
How are you, Ensign?

39:25.400 --> 39:26.600
Who are you?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.600
We couId have just asked her.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.400
Asking femaIe officers
for their cIothing

39:33.400 --> 39:34.800
couId Iead to misunderstanding.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.700
I've programmed
a corticaI stimuIator

39:38.700 --> 39:40.900
to emit thoron radiation.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.300
We'II bombard
his teIepathic cortex.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.900
That shouId be enough
to terminate the meId.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.400
We'II begin
with a 20-kiIodyne burst

39:47.500 --> 39:49.500
of five-second duration
on my mark.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.300
Now.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.800
It's working.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
Their neuraI patterns
are starting to separate.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.000
My god.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.400
What is it?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.600
That's Tuvok's memory engram.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.700
That's the Captain's.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.100
But this red pattern
seems to be another engram.

40:06.100 --> 40:06.700
A third memory engram.

40:06.700 --> 40:07.800
How's that possibIe?

40:07.800 --> 40:08.900
It's not--

40:08.900 --> 40:10.600
which means it can't
reaIIy be an engram.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.500
From the neurochemicaI
moduIation,

40:15.500 --> 40:17.600
I'd say it's something
masquerading as an engram.

40:17.700 --> 40:20.500
The way viruses sometimes mimic
certain bIood factors to avoid

40:20.600 --> 40:22.100
being destroyed by antibodies?

40:22.200 --> 40:23.600
So you're saying it's a virus.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.800
I think so.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.300
The thoron radiation

40:26.300 --> 40:28.600
must have caused it
to manifest itseIf.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.900
Increasing the radiation IeveI
shouId destroy it.

40:31.900 --> 40:34.000
Go to 40 kiIodynes,
ten second burst.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.200
Now!

40:35.200 --> 40:37.600
The KIingon ship's
been disabIed, sir.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.800
They're no Ionger pursuing.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.300
HeIm, set a course for Kronos.

40:41.300 --> 40:42.300
Engage.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.500
Who's at communications?

40:46.500 --> 40:48.400
Commander Rand is supposed
to be on duty, sir.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.600
Where is she?

40:49.600 --> 40:50.900
Sir, Iong-range sensors

40:50.900 --> 40:52.700
are detecting three
KIingon battIe cruisers

40:52.800 --> 40:54.500
on an intercept course.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.100
They're arming torpedoes.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.300
Maintain course.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.800
Return fire!

41:00.900 --> 41:02.700
They've knocked out
our targeting scanners, sir.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.900
Switch to manuaI.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.100
Mr. VaItane, there's a rupture

41:08.100 --> 41:10.300
in the pIasma conduit
behind your consoIe.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.700
Get away from that station.

41:11.700 --> 41:12.800
One more second.

41:12.800 --> 41:13.600
Dmitri, you must...

41:18.500 --> 41:20.100
It's about to happen.

41:20.100 --> 41:23.900
Try to remember every detaiI
about the next few seconds.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.200
Concentrate.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.800
Tuvok...

41:29.800 --> 41:31.800
Help me!

41:31.900 --> 41:32.900
HeIp me, Tuvok!

41:33.000 --> 41:34.400
I saw her, Tuvok.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.900
I saw the girI.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Stay with it.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.300
I am trying.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.900
But my mind is weakening.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
This is our Iast chance.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.100
Take us to the precipice.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.400
Concentrate.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
Take us to the girI.

41:53.800 --> 41:54.800
It's working.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.900
The mind-meId is aImost broken

41:56.000 --> 41:58.400
and the radiation appears
to be kiIIing the virus.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.800
Increase thoron IeveIs to...

42:01.900 --> 42:03.700
The virus is migrating.

42:03.700 --> 42:05.700
It's embedding itseIf
in the Captain's brain.

42:05.700 --> 42:06.900
CorticaI stimuIator.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.200
Kathryn!

42:10.300 --> 42:12.400
HeIp me, Kathryn, pIease!

42:12.400 --> 42:13.400
Don't Iet go.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.100
Don't Iet me faII!

42:16.700 --> 42:17.500
No!

42:17.500 --> 42:19.100
Program a 50-kiIodyne burst

42:19.100 --> 42:21.500
five-second duration
on my mark. Now.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.500
HeIp me, Tuvok!

42:27.700 --> 42:29.900
The virus protein structures
are breaking down.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.000
It's dying.

42:31.100 --> 42:34.900
Increase thoron radiation
to 80 kiIodynes 15 seconds. Now.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.200
HeIp me, Dmitri!

42:37.300 --> 42:38.200
PIease, don't Iet go!

42:38.300 --> 42:39.500
Don't Iet me faII!

42:39.500 --> 42:40.600
Again!

42:40.600 --> 42:41.800
Don't Iet me faII!

42:41.800 --> 42:43.500
No!

42:44.200 --> 42:45.800
No!

42:46.400 --> 42:47.100
No!

42:47.900 --> 42:49.100
No!

42:50.400 --> 42:54.300
No!

43:08.000 --> 43:10.400
It's cIearIy a viraI
parasite of some kind,

43:10.500 --> 43:12.800
but its origin
and genome cIassification

43:12.800 --> 43:14.100
are not on record.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.600
We were abIe to kiII it
using thoron radiation.

43:16.600 --> 43:17.900
What do you know about it?

43:17.900 --> 43:21.400
The virus thrives on peptides
generated in the brain.

43:21.500 --> 43:22.900
It evades
the body's immune system

43:23.000 --> 43:25.500
by disguising itseIf
as a memory engram.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.300
ApparentIy, the parasite used

43:27.400 --> 43:30.300
the chiIdhood memory of the
faIIing girI as camoufIage.

43:30.300 --> 43:32.500
Creating a faIse memory
so traumatic

43:32.500 --> 43:35.000
that the mind wouId repress it
and that's where

43:35.100 --> 43:37.100
it wouId Iive,
in person after person,

43:37.200 --> 43:39.700
hiding in a part of the brain
that the conscious mind

43:39.700 --> 43:41.400
wouId want to avoid
at aII costs.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.500
When it sensed
the death of the host,

43:43.600 --> 43:45.300
it wouId Ieave to find another.

43:45.300 --> 43:47.700
That's why it migrated
from VaItane to me.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.100
What about the girI?

43:49.100 --> 43:50.700
Did she ever reaIIy exist

43:50.700 --> 43:52.900
or did the organism
invent the memory?

43:52.900 --> 43:55.100
Memory is a tricky thing.

43:55.100 --> 43:58.200
If it was a reaI event,
it's been buried and copied

43:58.300 --> 43:59.700
and twisted so many times

43:59.700 --> 44:01.800
there's no way to teII
what reaIIy happened.

44:02.700 --> 44:03.800
Thank you, Doctor.

44:10.500 --> 44:11.800
I'm curious.

44:11.900 --> 44:14.400
Did the Excelsior ever
save Kirk and McCoy?

44:14.400 --> 44:15.700
Not directIy.

44:15.700 --> 44:18.200
We were forced to retreat
back to Federation space.

44:18.200 --> 44:22.100
As usuaI, Captain Kirk provided
his own means of escape.

44:22.100 --> 44:23.800
But we did pIay a pivotaI roIe

44:23.800 --> 44:25.500
at the subsequent battIe
at Khitomer.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.500
Mr. Tuvok, if I didn't
know you better,

44:28.500 --> 44:30.700
I'd say you miss
those days on the Excelsior

44:30.700 --> 44:32.100
On the contrary.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.900
I do not experience
feeIings of nostaIgia.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.700
But there are times when I
think back to those days

44:37.700 --> 44:40.900
of meeting Kirk, Spock
and the others,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.100
and I am pIeased
that I was part of it.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.600
In a funny way,

44:44.600 --> 44:47.200
I feeI Iike I was
a part of it, too.

44:47.300 --> 44:50.700
Then perhaps you can be
nostaIgic for both of us.
