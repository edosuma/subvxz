<i>go home.</i>

18:04.458 --> 18:05.501
We're done here.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.336
You too,
jobs over.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.504
Okay!

18:09.463 --> 18:10.380
Astral!

18:10.464 --> 18:11.673
Do you have a statement
on what just happened?

18:11.757 --> 18:15.803
I'd like to thank everyone who
came out to support our cause.

18:15.886 --> 18:20.307
But more importantly,
I'd like to thank Peter,

18:20.390 --> 18:22.184
for saving
the woods.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.189
It looks like all it takes
is a few brave kids

18:27.272 --> 18:30.359
to make the world
a greener place.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.528
For Channel 1, I'm
Marla Cavanaugh...

18:32.611 --> 18:35.322
and I'm gonna go
climb a tree!

18:37.950 --> 18:41.370
Hey, ah I'll go get you a
jacket, I knew you could do it.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.704
Thank you.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.292
For everything.

18:47.584 --> 18:53.882
(royal horns)

18:53.966 --> 18:55.676
You made a wise
choice, Petrathon.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.595
Mom, Dad!

18:58.679 --> 19:01.682
I'm so proud of
you, Astral.

19:01.765 --> 19:02.724
Me, too.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.559
I helped, too.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.601
Can I get my
wings now?

19:04.685 --> 19:08.397
And where do you think
you're going, Sir Winston?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.190
I'm trying to find
Peasey a churro.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.693
I kind of
promised.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.485
Oh ah,
excuse me?

19:13.569 --> 19:15.320
Might I ask where
you got that?

19:15.404 --> 19:17.447
Buzz off, m'lord.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.367
I'm partaking on a
well-deserved victory snack.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.535
Wait a minute--

19:21.618 --> 19:22.369
I'd know that
voice anywhere!

19:22.452 --> 19:24.246
<i>Brendoni?!</i>

19:24.329 --> 19:25.622
You!

19:25.706 --> 19:27.916
You lied to me about
being a wizard!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.210
Hey, listen, bud--

19:30.294 --> 19:32.254
You made me jump
in a mud puddle!

19:32.337 --> 19:34.173
Oh, yeah, that
was a fun day...

19:34.256 --> 19:35.591
And you almost
ate me!

19:35.674 --> 19:37.259
That was a
lifetime ago!

19:37.342 --> 19:39.261
I'm a changed
troll.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.387
Let me make
it up to you.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.558
Oh no, no, no, no.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.185
Anything but that.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.814
Come on,
Peasey!

19:50.898 --> 19:52.941
You're my
churro hero!

19:53.025 --> 19:56.153
Okay, but now
we're even!

19:56.236 --> 19:56.862
Ha, ha.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.950
When I first
came here,

20:02.034 --> 20:03.368
I thought I was
coming for Tristan.

20:03.452 --> 20:07.289
And that I would have to
change for him to like me.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.584
Hey Tristan, hey,
hey Tristan!

20:10.667 --> 20:13.754
What are
you doing?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.797
But that's
not true.

20:15.881 --> 20:19.301
Being myself is the best
gift I can give someone.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.678
(laughing)

20:21.762 --> 20:25.974
With your friends you
can do anything.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.435
But hopefully you'll join us,
to save Evermore woods!

20:28.518 --> 20:29.686
Ahh, get it off!

20:29.770 --> 20:34.316
We saved Athenia today, and if
that's not a reason to party,

20:34.399 --> 20:36.777
I don't know
what is.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.988
No, no,
noooo!!!

20:40.072 --> 20:41.573
Aghhh!

20:43.575 --> 20:47.663
This is hardly the hero's
welcome I was expecting.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.957
You almost
hit my boots.

20:50.040 --> 20:50.999
You're back!

20:51.083 --> 20:53.835
This quest you sent me
on, it was very difficult.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.087
Were you able
to complete it?

20:55.170 --> 20:58.382
Has Oswald the great ever not
been able to complete a quest?

20:58.465 --> 20:59.466
Never.

20:59.549 --> 21:03.804
Okay once, yes yes, once,
but to be fair everyone

21:03.887 --> 21:07.015
succumbs to the siren
song and eventually

21:07.099 --> 21:09.810
I did leave that island so
technically speaking--

21:09.893 --> 21:12.354
Enough!!

21:13.814 --> 21:17.567
Did you find out
about the boy?

21:17.651 --> 21:18.527
Yes.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.695
And?

21:19.778 --> 21:21.863
It's exactly as
you feared.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.783
Perfect.

21:24.866 --> 21:28.745
That should make Astral's dance
tomorrow quite memorable.
