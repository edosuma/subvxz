00:06.339 --> 00:07.507
How are you feeling?

00:09.259 --> 00:11.803
I want you to feel better.

00:12.804 --> 00:16.266
So if going home
might make you feel better…

00:18.309 --> 00:19.728
it's a good thing.

00:32.532 --> 00:35.035
So, like, "Come on."
How would you say that?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.662
<i>Venga! Vamos!</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:40.165
<i>Venga! Vamos!</i>

00:40.248 --> 00:41.249
That right?

00:42.500 --> 00:43.585
Okay.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.099
What?

00:59.225 --> 01:00.310
You're smiling.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.778
Oh, my God.

01:09.861 --> 01:10.779
Oh.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.906
Yes!

01:12.989 --> 01:14.449
I approve. Highly.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.533
Oh.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.828
<i>Bienvenidos </i>to Day 1.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.873
We are getting our feet wet
with the three easiest surgeries.

01:21.956 --> 01:26.377
<i>In OR 1, Dr. Rendon and I</i>
<i>have Leon Castillo…</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:28.463
[continues indistinctly]

01:28.546 --> 01:31.758
-[doctor] Antibiotic flush.
-[EKG machine beeping rhythmically]

01:36.471 --> 01:38.348
[Shaun in Spanish] The incision is open.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.683
Nurse Morales, I need a Kelly clamp.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.185
Here you go, Dr. Murphy.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.774
[Dr. Andrews in English] Okay, Dr. Murphy,
I'll guide you to the lesion.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.491
[beeping, electricity powers down]

02:05.250 --> 02:07.252
[theme music playing]

02:15.593 --> 02:17.220
[Karla in Spanish] No, no, no, no.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.014
Everyone must get to work on this.
Yes, hold on.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.476
[in English] I'm so sorry. We get
blackouts in the mountains all the time.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.853
That's why we have a generator.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.146
-Great.
-Which failed.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.730
You got a guess
when it comes back?

02:27.814 --> 02:28.857
Mm, sorry, no.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.066
Minutes? Hours?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.153
We wait, we risk losing the whole day,
dropping three patients.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.947
If I move my patient by the window,
I can debride the ulcer.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.323
Go. Pray it stays clear out.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.450
I'll see what I can do
about a herniated bowel.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.369
Can you resect a tumor
without ultrasound?

02:41.452 --> 02:44.789
I will speak to Dr. Andrews
about a revised surgical plan.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.957
Okay. Go.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.542
[in Spanish]
Thank you so much.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.835
[in English] Good luck.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.717
Suction's out.
Same for the electrocautery.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.511
Want to use your fingers?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.221
It would minimize blood loss.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.853
We could remove the lower lobe
without ultrasound.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.272
Maybe we should close her up
and do this tomorrow.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.107
It would be fatal.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.192
Not to her.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.820
To a patient down the list
that we'll have to drop.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.823
[Dr. Andrews sighs] Maybe you're right.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.491
We take the whole lower lobe.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.636
No, I was not right.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.388
I can locate the tumor
without ultrasound.

03:47.185 --> 03:54.108
[Sofia in Spanish]
Her oxygen is very low. Ox-Oxygen. Low.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.611
[in English] Her oxygen is low.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.489
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.036
[in Spanish] Where is Oscar?

04:05.119 --> 04:07.288
He had to go home.

04:07.372 --> 04:12.043
His mom is old and very sick.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.920
[in English] He went home.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.130
[in Spanish] To your house?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.423
-Yes.
-Hmm.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.971
[in English]
Mm… Stay? Please?

04:33.648 --> 04:36.526
[Dr. Mateo] I can feel pulsations
of an underlying vessel.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.902
[Dr. Lim] Must be the artery.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.822
Feel your way under and make
the dissection plane deeper.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.827
[Dr. Mateo] I can feel the bowel.

04:47.662 --> 04:48.663
Sac is free.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.502
[Dr. Andrews] You're probably
getting close to a fissure.

04:54.585 --> 04:57.380
I am. The tissue is
becoming less pliable.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.882
[Dr. Andrews] A laceration there
would be devastating.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.553
We could wait a few more minutes
to see if the lights come on.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.513
[Shaun] I don't think we should.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.852
I feel something gravel-like
at the tip of my pickups.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.937
I think that's the surface
of the tumor.

05:14.981 --> 05:15.982
I'm there.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.861
Nice work, Murphy. We have
a clean path to the tumor.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.321
Let's get it out.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.614
[electricity powers on,
machinery beeping]

05:23.698 --> 05:24.699
[Shaun] Oh.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.993
I guess we could have waited.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.911
[monitor beeping steadily]

06:05.656 --> 06:07.658
How do you speak English so well?

06:09.702 --> 06:10.912
I'm American.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.956
Born in Mexico,

06:14.040 --> 06:17.043
but my mom is an L.A. Mexican-American.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.170
I went to high school in Santa Monica.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.798
I just fake the accent
for sexiness purposes.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.883
[cellphone chiming]

06:24.550 --> 06:25.551
[chiming stops]

06:27.720 --> 06:30.139
So when's the last time you were back?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.228
Are we getting to know each other?

06:35.311 --> 06:37.772
I thought this was just a fling.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.067
Mm. So we can chat about
what schools you went to

06:41.150 --> 06:42.860
and where you worked in Africa,

06:42.944 --> 06:45.738
but old vacations are a bridge too far?

06:47.532 --> 06:49.200
10 years. Happy?

06:49.992 --> 06:51.077
Quite, in fact.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.248
I have to go for a run.

06:55.873 --> 06:56.707
Now?

06:56.791 --> 06:58.334
You're clearly not a runner.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.253
I promise to be very quick.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.963
Like, poof, and it's gone,

07:02.046 --> 07:04.048
a fleeting but joyous memory.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.676
Oh, I can feel that
accent-generated sexiness

07:06.759 --> 07:08.261
just vanishing by the second.

07:08.344 --> 07:11.389
Quick but perfectly paced.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.058
I'm gonna hold you to both of those.

07:14.142 --> 07:18.104
Well, the truth is,
I will not be very quick.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.950
[in Spanish] Is it going to hurt a lot?

07:32.034 --> 07:34.078
[in English]
He wants to know if it'll hurt.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.538
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.665
We'll be giving you some meds,

07:37.748 --> 07:40.376
and you'll have
very little pain after the operation.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.587
[in Spanish]
We're going to give you medication,

07:42.670 --> 07:45.089
so that you have very little pain
after the operation.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.221
And before the operation,

07:52.305 --> 07:54.682
we're going to give you
something to help you sleep.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.268
And when you wake up,
your mom will be right there.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.561
[sighs]

08:00.021 --> 08:01.439
[speaking indistinctly]

08:01.939 --> 08:05.568
[in English] He didn't realize he was
gonna be asleep during the surgery.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.781
Nurse Morales, how would one say,

08:10.865 --> 08:13.784
"You, in addition
to being very efficient,

08:13.868 --> 08:17.079
turn out to be
very perceptive as well"?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.333
[speaking Spanish]

08:29.217 --> 08:32.345
[in English] I feel like you may have
added a few adjectives.

08:32.428 --> 08:36.641
Well, the truth is,
I'm not always so perceptive.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.976
For example…

08:40.269 --> 08:43.356
I was almost sure you were flirting.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.691
Flirting with me.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.069
But if you were,

08:48.528 --> 08:50.947
I'm sure you would've
taken off your wedding ring.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.929
You know, it's okay to be nervous.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.639
I'm not.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.018
You should be proud.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.897
You did a remarkable thing,
convincing her to come here.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.691
You probably saved her life.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.656
I'm just gonna sit here for a little while

09:33.739 --> 09:36.158
in case there's something
that you want to tell me.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.333
Because of me, my mother will live,

09:45.835 --> 09:47.670
but someone else…

09:50.798 --> 09:52.091
[breathing deeply]

09:52.174 --> 09:54.302
I prayed that she would get the operation,

09:55.553 --> 09:57.555
but she only did because Miguel,

09:59.181 --> 10:00.600
the guy with the dog…

10:02.977 --> 10:04.395
Because he got sick.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.231
[sighs]

10:08.774 --> 10:10.026
You're a good person.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.154
And sometimes that's hard because

10:13.237 --> 10:15.406
you feel things that you…

10:15.489 --> 10:17.199
You don't deserve to feel.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.910
But sometimes…

10:21.579 --> 10:23.331
being good is fun.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.003
Come on. [pats leg]

10:33.174 --> 10:34.383
[monitor beeping]

10:34.467 --> 10:37.637
[Dr. Andrews] I've freed the tumor
from the paranasal sinuses.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.015
Periosteal dissector.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.354
[sighs]

10:46.437 --> 10:48.981
It's invading the orbital floor.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.066
Curved osteotome.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.984
[beeping continues]

10:54.820 --> 10:56.656
And the ethmoid and sphenoid, too.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.283
We're gonna have to remove multiple bones.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.787
Does the hospital have
titanium miniplates and mesh?

11:02.870 --> 11:04.497
Nothing that would work here.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.249
Could we just cover the hard palate?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.377
No. We'd give him a few years
of constant pain,

11:09.460 --> 11:11.837
and he'd still wind up
with a fistula that kills him.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.466
Is there a-a private hospital,
specialist, something?

11:17.676 --> 11:19.887
I have a friend from nursing school.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.305
She works for a dental surgeon

11:21.389 --> 11:23.057
who fixes the rich people
in this area.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.809
I can be there and back in an hour.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.520
Uh, k-keep him stable. Okay?

11:27.603 --> 11:28.687
Thank you.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.442
I was not fair before
when I was teasing.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.736
You were very fair. I <i>was </i>flirting.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.365
And how would your wife feel?

11:40.074 --> 11:42.034
Well, she'd be fine with it.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.119
[scoffs]

11:44.286 --> 11:46.705
I've heard men say that to me before.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.961
Well, she told me a few days ago
that she's moving out.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.462
And, uh…

11:54.839 --> 11:55.923
Well…

11:57.633 --> 11:59.260
She's seeing someone.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.722
So I'm down here, clearing my head,

12:03.806 --> 12:06.434
deciding if I want to try
to make the marriage work.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.895
By flirting?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.942
I guess I just wanted to feel…wanted.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.235
To feel good.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.530
It was selfish.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.574
I'm sorry it made you
feel uncomfortable.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.452
It didn't.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.713
And I think you <i>do </i>want
to make your marriage work.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.466
That's why you still wear your ring.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.758
[engine starts]

12:51.061 --> 12:52.271
[chuckles]

12:59.069 --> 13:00.696
[children laughing in distance]

13:26.514 --> 13:27.932
[in Spanish] We settled on 20.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.725
-You said four.
-I said 20.

13:29.808 --> 13:33.187
No. It was four. We agreed on it.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.813
A boy's life depends on this.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.400
I'm sorry. I think there was
a misunderstanding.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.279
[sighs]

13:44.615 --> 13:47.493
[in English] He's telling us it costs us
20,000 Quetzales now.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.786
-And do we have that?
-No.

13:48.869 --> 13:49.995
I can go to an ATM.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.499
No, no, there's no automatic
cashier machine I can use.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.543
This is my fault.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.172
No.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.132
I shouldn't have come.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.302
He sees an American doctor,
knows he can ask for more.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.472
There's a hospital in Quetzaltenango
a few hours from here.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.777
-Offer him this, too.
-No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.070
You don't <i>have</i> to do this.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.781
Ana, just a ring.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.294
[monitor beeping rapidly]

14:38.961 --> 14:41.088
[in Spanish]
Her oxygen level is much too low.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.299
-No.
-The doctor is coming to give her steroids

14:43.382 --> 14:45.718
to try to stop
the inflammation in her lungs.

14:45.801 --> 14:46.969
We need a ventilator.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.889
[in English] Ventilator?
She has to go on a ventilator?

14:54.184 --> 14:56.186
[call ringing]

14:58.689 --> 14:59.690
<i>Hello.</i>

15:00.232 --> 15:02.359
Hey, Shaun. How you doing?

15:03.027 --> 15:06.488
<i>I just finished my second surgery</i>
<i>and it went well.</i>

15:06.572 --> 15:07.990
<i>And I am not doing well at all.</i>

15:09.116 --> 15:10.492
Okay.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.411
Lea is sad.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.415
And I don't know
how to make her less sad.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.334
Do you?

15:19.418 --> 15:21.962
<i>Well, I don't know if I'm the right person</i>

15:22.922 --> 15:24.757
<i>to talk about this right now.</i>

15:25.466 --> 15:26.634
Why not?

15:29.803 --> 15:32.806
<i>I just don't think that right now…</i>

15:33.933 --> 15:35.059
[sighs]

15:35.142 --> 15:37.645
<i>I've always loved that</i>
<i>you've asked me for advice.</i>

15:37.728 --> 15:39.229
<i>And I always will.</i>

15:42.858 --> 15:45.069
But I've noticed…

15:46.070 --> 15:47.988
the last while,

15:48.072 --> 15:50.491
you've needed me less and less.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.994
I don't know if you've noticed,
but it got me to thinking

15:54.078 --> 15:57.539
about what Steve told you,
that you're the smart one.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.666
[chuckles]

15:58.749 --> 16:00.751
You… You can do anything.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.342
You're good at this.

16:08.842 --> 16:09.927
Better than…

16:11.971 --> 16:13.597
Better than you think.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.603
[exhales slowly]

16:23.023 --> 16:24.024
Ready?

16:33.409 --> 16:34.827
[in Spanish]
Does it look good?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.081
[in English] Beautiful.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.583
[in Spanish] Beautiful.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.876
[sighs]

16:52.553 --> 16:53.554
[mouths inaudibly]

17:07.484 --> 17:09.194
How did you end up in Guatemala?

17:09.903 --> 17:12.448
Yikes, you're just not good
at flings, are you?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.451
You should be asking me
if I've read the <i>Kama Sutra,</i>

17:15.534 --> 17:17.536
my favorite whipped cream.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.332
It's a good job.

17:23.083 --> 17:27.212
I get to coordinate these missions,
help some people.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.797
So you're the workaholic,

17:28.881 --> 17:32.134
"dedicate your life to the downtrodden"
hero type?

17:32.593 --> 17:33.802
Is that what drives you?

17:33.886 --> 17:37.306
I also get to sometimes have sex
with American doctors.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.560
You're only here for a week.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.063
We don't need to bare our souls
to each other.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.023
On the other hand,

17:47.024 --> 17:49.234
I'm only here for a week, so why not?

17:52.279 --> 17:53.447
You first.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.698
What are you hiding?

17:55.365 --> 17:56.784
I'm not hiding anything.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.452
Okay.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.914
I prefer a fresh local product,
but if you have lactose issues…

18:01.997 --> 18:03.332
Wait, why did you ask me that?

18:03.415 --> 18:06.335
Seriously. Why are we
having this conversation?

18:06.418 --> 18:07.961
You think I'm being dishonest.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.505
What do you think I'm hiding?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.299
I don't know.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.677
But between your excessive
need to exercise,

18:15.761 --> 18:19.014
the alarms going off that you never answer
when you're around me,

18:19.098 --> 18:22.309
and the nightmares
that you have every night,

18:22.392 --> 18:24.228
you're hiding something.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.566
Let's get ready for the day.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.079
You ready to start?

18:42.162 --> 18:44.790
[inhales deeply] Almost.

18:47.584 --> 18:51.004
There's three kinds of foreign doctors
who come down here.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.424
The first, they care too much.

18:55.175 --> 18:59.596
All the people they can't save,
it, uh, overwhelms them.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.433
The second care too little,
and that has problems of its own.

19:03.767 --> 19:04.643
Hmm.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.603
And the third group,

19:06.687 --> 19:09.022
they find a way to distance themselves

19:09.106 --> 19:10.941
so they can do their job.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.735
I better be in that group.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.946
You're in your own group.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.783
You care so deeply.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.454
But that only gives you more strength.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.750
[chuckles] Thank you.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.837
Well, let's go.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.887
Entering the peritoneal cavity.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.597
I need a long retractor.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.515
[Karla in Spanish]
Long retractor.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.692
[in English] That's not just gallstones.

19:53.775 --> 19:57.654
[Claire] There is an immobile,
irregularly shaped mass.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.075
[sighs]

20:02.159 --> 20:03.911
[Claire] She's got gallbladder cancer,

20:03.994 --> 20:05.913
and it's spread
to the surface of the liver.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.498
It will double the duration
of the surgery.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.125
Triple, 12 hours at least.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.752
I'll need to swap with one of you.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.046
That's not possible.
Neither of us are prepped.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.007
It would be endangering
two patients instead of one.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.051
We can't just close her up.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.636
Unfortunately, we can.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.556
I'm sorry,
but you've never led anything like this.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.354
I think we should let her keep going.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.231
What's the worst that can happen?

20:32.314 --> 20:34.816
-Beyond death?
-This patient was gonna die anyway.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.944
Claire at least gives her
a fighting chance.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.202
Okay.

20:49.831 --> 20:55.087
[in Spanish]
What happened to the ventilator?

20:55.170 --> 20:58.590
They took it away.
They needed it for the surgery.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.761
The doctors needed it.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.805
[in English] The doctors needed it?

21:05.889 --> 21:07.724
And where's the nurse?

21:08.558 --> 21:09.977
[in Spanish] The nurse?

21:10.769 --> 21:13.522
Busy. Lots of work.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.023
[in English] Okay.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.859
I'll stay.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.779
Stay here no matter how long it takes.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.035
[in Spanish] Is there a problem?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.620
Yeah. The patient returned.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.458
[breathing shakily]

21:38.130 --> 21:40.340
[in English] Leon, the guy
with the ventral hernia,

21:40.424 --> 21:42.676
checked himself out last night
and went to work.

21:42.759 --> 21:43.677
In construction.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.679
He reherniated? How bad?

21:45.762 --> 21:48.765
About an inch of bowel is incarcerated,
probably ischemic.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.059
He'll be dead in days
unless we operate on him.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.687
Can you fit him in
after your skull reconstruction?

21:53.770 --> 21:56.857
Not without big risks to both of them.
What about the other surgeons?

21:56.940 --> 21:59.026
You think I'd be here
if anyone else was free?

21:59.943 --> 22:01.028
[sighs]

22:01.111 --> 22:02.487
Give him some morphine.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.531
Until when?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.659
It sucks but it's his own fault.
We told him he needed to rest.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.871
This isn't some tech bro in San Francisco
waltzing out to party.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.665
He needed to keep his job
and not watch his family starve.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.710
If we operate on him,
we don't operate on someone else.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.507
I'll operate on Leon.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.428
I've been doing P.T. the last year.
It's been going great.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.472
You really think
you can handle the surgery?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.183
I know I can.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.602
I think I can do it without any pain.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.196
[Claire]
We need to do a cross-clamp resection.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.823
-Have you ever done one?
-I've seen one.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.743
-When I was an intern.
-[sighs]

22:55.457 --> 22:56.792
Freeing up the vein.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.627
[in Spanish]
Freeing up the vein.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.591
[in English] Dividing the pedicles.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.052
[in Spanish] Separating the pedicles.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.390
[in English] Transecting the segments.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.476
[in Spanish] Transection of the segments.

23:22.609 --> 23:23.819
[sighs]

23:28.573 --> 23:30.075
[in English] Okay. Step two.

23:35.330 --> 23:38.083
[sighs] That doesn't look ideal.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.335
It's a midline ventral defect.

23:40.418 --> 23:43.463
Also, the tissue planes are friable.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.590
We're gonna need component separation.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.592
[inhales sharply]

23:47.676 --> 23:49.719
I'm gonna cut the posterior
rectus sheath,

23:49.803 --> 23:53.723
mobilizing soft tissue
off of the external oblique fascia

23:55.225 --> 23:56.726
and then incise it.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.818
Common femoral artery's
almost completely occluded.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.320
I'll prep the inflow anastomosis site.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.785
I have PTSD.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.123
I have nightmares because of it.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.250
I exercise to help me
manage my symptoms.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.169
And the alarm on my phone

24:22.252 --> 24:24.004
is to remind me to take
my daily cocktail

24:24.087 --> 24:26.923
of Fluoxetine, Prazosin, and Quetiapine.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.385
Can you tunnel the bypass graft
in the subcutaneous plane?

24:31.428 --> 24:33.096
I'll get a clamp through.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.685
I lost a good friend a year ago

24:39.603 --> 24:41.980
and then lost more to COVID

24:42.063 --> 24:46.151
and then spent a lot of time
denying I had an issue.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.405
Running from pain.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.286
In the future, I'm hoping to do

24:56.369 --> 24:59.206
more running toward things
than away from them.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.003
I'm ready for the graft.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.882
[surgical instrument clicks]

25:21.102 --> 25:22.187
[sighs]

25:23.772 --> 25:26.650
[in Spanish] Oh.
Oh, it's my turn.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.444
[in English]
You're exhausted. You should lie down.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.196
No. No.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.405
10 minutes.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.324
[in Spanish] Ten minutes.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.370
[in English] I'm good. I'll rest next.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.497
[in Spanish] Me next.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.834
[in English] Ten minutes.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.170
[in Spanish] Thank you.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.426
[sighs]

25:57.889 --> 25:59.891
[Dr. Reznick exhales sharply]

26:03.436 --> 26:04.646
If you need a break…

26:04.729 --> 26:07.357
I'm fine. Just cramped a little.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.736
[Dr. Park] I'm done.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.659
I can take over.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.160
[monitor beeping]

26:32.882 --> 26:35.302
This ventral wall defect is huge.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.221
[Dr. Reznick] Yeah.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.022
[Dr. Park] Two Kocher clamps.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.896
[monitor beeping rapidly]

27:27.979 --> 27:29.189
Heart rate is spiking.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.815
B.P.'s dropping. She's crashing.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.400
Why? What happened?

27:34.569 --> 27:35.779
I don't know.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.787
Edna's bleeding out.
At this rate, she has minutes to live.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.289
There is post-op blood around the liver,
nothing crazy.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.124
The surgical drain also has blood.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.376
No evidence of bile leak.

27:49.459 --> 27:53.838
Okay, so the patient could have G.I. bleed
unrelated to surgery

27:53.922 --> 27:56.341
or a leak into the liver
from the hepatectomy.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.717
Yes. Which one?

27:57.801 --> 28:00.095
Mm, what's the surgical drain output

28:00.178 --> 28:01.679
over the last half-hour?

28:01.763 --> 28:03.390
If it's over 200 cc, the answ…

28:03.473 --> 28:04.933
It's 200 cc. Exactly.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.518
-Oh.
-Yeah.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.978
I think it's the stomach.

28:09.062 --> 28:12.023
The clotted blood in the N.G. tube
could be holding back a flood.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.193
An intrahepatic bleed
is statistically more likely.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.905
I still think it's the stomach.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.699
But I came to you for a reason.

28:21.783 --> 28:22.784
Okay, thanks.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.910
Claire.

28:25.286 --> 28:28.373
Neither of us knows for sure, but…

28:30.708 --> 28:32.127
you are good at this.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.505
Better than you think.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.429
[monitor beeping rapidly]

28:44.013 --> 28:46.433
[Karla] B.P.'s almost bottomed out.
What do we do?

28:48.643 --> 28:49.728
Stomach.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.822
You did good work.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.533
I just had to close and clean up.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.453
The patient's in recovery, doing well.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.460
[sighs]

29:14.836 --> 29:16.254
I need a friend.

29:23.678 --> 29:27.515
I hadn't really given up
on being a surgeon.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.935
P.T. was going great.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.438
Uh… almost no pain at all.

29:33.521 --> 29:36.149
And… [sighs]

29:36.232 --> 29:40.445
It's all dumb
because I like being an internist.

29:40.528 --> 29:43.364
I just… [sighs]

29:44.991 --> 29:46.075
…hate…

29:48.995 --> 29:50.205
…failing.

29:53.666 --> 29:54.876
[chuckles]

29:56.002 --> 29:58.421
Seriously? This is funny?

30:00.298 --> 30:01.508
A little.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.093
Never seen you vulnerable.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.557
Your face gets kind of ugly.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.934
[chuckles]

30:11.726 --> 30:12.602
Shut up.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.647
You didn't fail.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.692
You never fail.

30:21.736 --> 30:25.782
For three years I've watched you kick ass.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.659
At everything.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.829
You inspire me.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.456
And annoy me.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.502
Small price to pay.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.766
Your mom's gonna be all better.

31:02.318 --> 31:04.529
[in Spanish] Her lungs sound good,

31:05.154 --> 31:06.739
without retractions.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.616
But there's only one way

31:08.700 --> 31:11.119

31:11.828 --> 31:13.246

[baby cooing]

31:43.151 --> 31:44.152
[in Spanish] Goodbye.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.280
[in English] No, no.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.659
[in Spanish] We need to go sleep a little.
And you do as well.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.202
[in English]
We need to sleep.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.496
[in Spanish] No, she doesn't finish yet.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.833
She needs to say goodbye.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.878
She already said goodbye.

32:01.961 --> 32:05.590
It's one of the three phrases
she knows in Castilian Spanish.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.929
Oh, I want… her to hold my baby.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.020
[in English]
She wants you to hold her baby.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.441
[sighs]

32:42.418 --> 32:45.046
Ooh. Ooh.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.347
She is so beautiful.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.135
[indistinct conversation]

34:18.765 --> 34:20.391
I'm sorry I've been weird…

34:21.184 --> 34:22.393
For a year.

34:24.604 --> 34:26.439
I really do care about you.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.524
I wish you and Heather the best.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.446
Well, it's a bit late for that.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.031
I broke up with Heather.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.784
When?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.077
Last night.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.704
-No.
-Yeah.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.793
Because…

34:48.086 --> 34:49.504
You think you love me?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.299
I do.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.473
I think I love you, too.

35:13.402 --> 35:14.821
I committed a crime.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.201
My first year of my residency,

35:20.284 --> 35:23.704
I… I was arrested for pot possession.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.124
The cops were jerks,

35:26.207 --> 35:28.626
I argued with them, and…

35:30.419 --> 35:31.838
It got physical.

35:34.423 --> 35:37.135
When my court date came around, I skipped.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.055
And now there's an active warrant
out for me in the States.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.016
That's why I haven't been back.

35:46.727 --> 35:50.565
But what if I got a lawyer,
got this cleared up?

35:51.899 --> 35:54.986
What if I was to start
running toward things?

35:58.739 --> 36:01.367
Would you be interested
in a visitor in San Jose?

36:09.542 --> 36:11.627
There's something I want to ask you.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.815
[sighs]

36:33.941 --> 36:35.568
I think you should take the job.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.697
Of course she wasn't gonna
poach you without asking me.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.325
[sighs]

36:44.827 --> 36:46.704
I can't speak the language.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.623
I don't know anyone here.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.834
I just started a relationship
with my father.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.838
I-I'm not ready.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.467
All legit concerns.

37:00.509 --> 37:02.553
But what I didn't hear
was one single reason

37:02.637 --> 37:04.055
you don't <i>want</i> to do this.

37:05.598 --> 37:09.435
You've spent so many years thinking
your heart was a liability…

37:09.518 --> 37:13.356
It made you care too much,
it hurt too much.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.778
[voice breaking] But maybe here…

37:20.863 --> 37:23.950
maybe here, caring too much
is exactly what's needed.

This is about time.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.543
You were far too good for us, anyway.

Many things.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.118
That I'm sad.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.707

I've been to without a Cinnabon.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.000

No.

40:24.505 --> 40:28.884
But right now,
I know I won't be sad forever.

40:28.968 --> 40:32.138
And I don't think I would've
gotten there without you.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.814
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

with you, too, Lea.
