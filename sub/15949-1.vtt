an incredible impression upon me.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.925
What's so compelling
about <i>Vertigo?</i>

00:49.050 --> 00:50.969
It is the—

00:51.052 --> 00:53.638
He's making a movie about
what a director does,

00:53.722 --> 00:56.933
which is basically create
these romantic illusions.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.437
It makes you fall in love with it
and then kills it. Twice.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.021
And it's what we do
as directors.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.774
We create these beautiful women,

01:04.858 --> 01:07.068
these exciting virile men.

01:07.152 --> 01:10.280
We get audiences involved
in their stories

01:10.363 --> 01:13.450
and emotionally attached
to them.

01:13.533 --> 01:16.995
And Hitchcock made a movie which is,
you know, it's so Brechtian.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.330
It's showing what we're doing
as we're doing it.

that has fascinated me, you know,

I was the youngest.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.397
I was born in North New Jersey.

01:44.481 --> 01:46.441
When I was about five,

01:46.524 --> 01:51.237
we moved into suburbian Philadelphia,
right off the Main Line,

01:51.321 --> 01:53.823
in a kind of fairly nice
suburban house.

01:53.907 --> 01:57.619
My father was a very successful
orthopedic surgeon,

01:57.702 --> 02:00.121
and then my mother was very close
to the three of us.

02:00.205 --> 02:02.624
She was over at school a lot.

02:02.707 --> 02:06.127
You know, going to our football practices
and soccer practices.

02:06.211 --> 02:11.007
My father basically drove into the city,
and operated very early and was teaching

02:11.132 --> 02:13.760
and then writing his books
when he got home at night.

02:13.843 --> 02:17.013
So, we didn't see
a lot of him.

02:17.138 --> 02:21.100
And we didn't have much
of a relationship with him.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.603
I went to a Quaker school,
Friends' Central.

02:23.686 --> 02:26.272
And I went to that school
for 12 years.

02:26.356 --> 02:29.234
Well, I'd say the thing that left the most
impression on me

02:29.317 --> 02:32.028
was, you know, meeting
at this Quaker school.

02:32.153 --> 02:36.282
Sitting in silence and thinking about
the moral aspects of your life,

02:36.366 --> 02:39.994
and if you had anything you wanted
to share with the community

02:40.078 --> 02:41.371
you stood up and talked.

02:41.454 --> 02:44.457
There was a lot of turmoil
in my family.

02:44.541 --> 02:46.668
My parents were not happy together,

02:46.751 --> 02:50.088
and at one point I got up
and talked about...

02:50.171 --> 02:55.635
the difficulties
going on within my family.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.512
I was very chummy
with the girls.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.222
I got along with the girls
very well.

02:59.305 --> 03:02.058
I would do sort of crazy things
occasionally,

03:02.183 --> 03:05.061
like taping
the girls sex education class.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.730
Debbie Deming,
as I recall her name,

03:07.814 --> 03:10.984
she dared me to do it,
and then of course I did it,

03:11.067 --> 03:15.238
and then of course I told her
and then she turned me in.

03:15.321 --> 03:19.701
I went to Columbia to study physics,
and math and Russian.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.369
I was basically a science nerd.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.705
I mean I wasn't really interested
in movies,

03:23.788 --> 03:25.290
not until I went to Columbia.

03:25.373 --> 03:29.335
There was a lot of excitement
because, of course, we had the war,

03:29.419 --> 03:31.045
had to worry about getting drafted.

03:31.129 --> 03:33.840
And we had all this French new wave
stuff coming in,

03:33.923 --> 03:35.383
all these foreign movies,

03:35.466 --> 03:37.260
So, it was
a pretty exciting time.

It was like, that's what you
talked about.

03:41.014 --> 03:42.307
That was like, the new thing.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.393
There was no place you could take film
at Columbia.

03:45.476 --> 03:50.565
I signed up for a cinema society
called Cinema 16,

03:50.648 --> 03:51.941
run by Amos Vogel.

03:52.025 --> 03:54.444

very avant-garde shorts.

you signed up for.

[De Palma] Bill Finley was a classmate
of mine at Columbia.

04:20.637 --> 04:22.347
So, I began to craft pieces

04:22.430 --> 04:25.808
for his particular kind
of characters he could portray.

04:25.892 --> 04:28.436
And that was the genesis
of <i>Woton's Wake,</i>

04:28.519 --> 04:29.812
<i>where he played everything</i>

04:29.896 --> 04:32.982
from the Phantom of the Opera
to King Kong.

04:33.066 --> 04:35.068
I'd seen a casting notice

04:35.151 --> 04:37.779
for a graduate project
at Sarah Lawrence

04:37.862 --> 04:39.989
and I said, "Oh, this looks like
a good idea."

04:40.073 --> 04:43.743
So, I went up to Sarah Lawrence
and I got into a graduate play.

04:43.826 --> 04:47.330
And that's when I met Wilford Leach,
who was very influential.

04:47.413 --> 04:51.084
And he was like my mentor.
He was a brilliant director.

04:51.167 --> 04:54.587
That's what really
started me going,

04:54.671 --> 04:57.215
in the sense of learning
all the things I had to learn

04:57.298 --> 05:00.134
in order to, you know,
be a director.

05:00.218 --> 05:03.221
My first feature came out
of Sarah Lawrence.

05:03.304 --> 05:07.016
We brought Will on to sort of
oversee the whole thing.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.728
And a lot of the people in it came right
out of the Sarah Lawrence workshop.

05:10.812 --> 05:13.564
Bobby was in
the Sarah Lawrence workshop.

05:13.648 --> 05:15.733
Jill was in
the Sarah Lawrence workshop.

05:15.817 --> 05:18.277
Jennifer Salt was in
the Sarah Lawrence workshop.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.613
Well, that sounds like free love.
What about purity?

05:20.697 --> 05:22.991
[De Palma] <i>The Wedding Party</i>
was De Niro's first movie.

05:23.074 --> 05:25.785
Bobby came into
a casting session

05:25.868 --> 05:29.163
and Will and I were
in the loft on Broadway.

05:29.247 --> 05:32.625
He's, like, the last guy
in the room.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.544
And he's very quiet, shy.

05:34.627 --> 05:37.964
And then he said he had something
he'd prepared in class.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.676
Then he went out, and Will and I
were sort of looking at each other,

05:41.759 --> 05:45.430
and, like, 20 minutes from—
We thought he'd left, it was at night.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.348
And then he burst through the door

05:47.432 --> 05:51.561
and does a scene
from Clifford Odets' play.

05:51.644 --> 05:55.481
<i>"Strike, I think about
the cab strike."</i>

05:55.565 --> 05:56.816
And it was like—

05:56.899 --> 06:00.862
You were, like, watching Lee J. Cobb
rant in front of the union guys.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.780
It was like, "holy mackerel!"

06:02.864 --> 06:04.550
The one place
where there's life, the beach.

06:04.574 --> 06:06.159
The dock,
where there's something—

06:06.242 --> 06:07.702
a connection
to the mainland.

06:07.785 --> 06:10.246
And you walk— Start walking
around the beach.

06:10.371 --> 06:14.292
[De Palma] The great irony was
that we co-directed <i>The Wedding Party.</i>

06:14.375 --> 06:18.254
That's when I saw and knew more about
motion picture directing than Wilford did.

06:18.379 --> 06:22.175
We had the scene with Bill Finley,
Bob De Niro and Charlie Pfluger,

06:22.258 --> 06:25.261
where the two boys are trying
to convince him not to get married.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.096
We were shooting it
and I could see

06:27.180 --> 06:28.806
that we were never able
to do the shot.

06:28.890 --> 06:30.475
Plus, it was not
a good shot.

06:30.558 --> 06:33.728
Because basically we're shooting
three guys against the hedge.

06:33.811 --> 06:37.231
You know, you weren't getting any value
out of the motion of the camera.

06:37.315 --> 06:40.902
And Will kept on insisting
that we do it this way.

06:40.985 --> 06:42.487
And then Will
kind of got frustrated,

06:42.570 --> 06:44.405
and I said,
"Will, let me block this act,

06:44.489 --> 06:46.908
because this is not the way.
This should work."

06:46.991 --> 06:48.868
So, I blocked it out
a whole different way.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.954
Broke the whole thing up
into a whole bunch of shots.

06:52.038 --> 06:55.333
And— And I made
the shot work.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.667
And he was wrong.

06:56.751 --> 06:59.962
I shot a lot of documentaries
in that period in order to support myself

07:00.046 --> 07:01.464
while I was in graduate school.

07:01.547 --> 07:05.301
I shot a documentary about the OP Art
opening at the Museum of Modern Art,

07:05.426 --> 07:06.844
which was pretty successful.

07:06.928 --> 07:08.638
I was a very good cameraman.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.431
You know, and I had
a really good sense

07:10.515 --> 07:13.351
how to follow a scene
and see what was happening.

07:13.434 --> 07:17.021
Well, the advantage of doing everything
yourself is that I did everything.

07:17.105 --> 07:19.357
I figured I'd really hit
the big time

07:19.440 --> 07:22.360
when I didn't have to pack up
the equipment at the end of the day

07:22.443 --> 07:24.570
and take it back
to the rental house.

07:24.654 --> 07:25.905
[screaming]

07:31.452 --> 07:34.831
You see a lot of the sort of Hitchcockian
things in <i>Murder a la Mod.</i>

07:34.914 --> 07:38.751
A lot of stylistic madness
going on.

07:38.835 --> 07:40.435
You have the scene
of Jennifer, you know,

07:40.461 --> 07:44.507
me trying to talk her into taking
her clothes off for the camera.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.926
Is this
supposed to be sexy?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.695
[De Palma] Well, yeah,
you're supposed to be,

07:48.719 --> 07:50.555
you know, doing sort of
strip tease for us.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.266
Which is very much like
the same scene

07:53.349 --> 07:54.851
that I did in <i>The Black Dahlia</i>

07:54.934 --> 07:56.853
where I'm interviewing an actress.

07:56.936 --> 07:59.063
- How long have you lived here?
- Two years.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.398
- You lost your accent?
- Yeah.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.941
[De Palma]
So, some of that stuff I,

08:02.024 --> 08:04.694
you know, started to play with
in <i>Murder a la Mod.</i>

08:04.777 --> 08:07.363
We had to release it
ourselves

08:07.488 --> 08:09.824
over on 12th Street
and Second Avenue.

08:09.907 --> 08:13.077
I was literally pulling people
off the street to go see it.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.204
When I was a graduate student
at Sarah Lawrence,

08:15.288 --> 08:17.540
Universal Pictures
paid my tuition.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.375
When I got out
of Sarah Lawrence

08:19.500 --> 08:23.087
I got into a new talents program
at Universal,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.673
and again I was writing stuff
but nobody ever read anything.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.967
And we became so frustrated
Chuck Hirsch and I,

08:28.050 --> 08:30.177

[De Palma] I mean, if you wanted

right at his forehead

09:27.568 --> 09:30.613
and talked about
my homosexual feelings.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.049
Just walk right up
to the sergeant.

09:32.073 --> 09:33.616
You gaze.
Just walked right up to him.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.552
Get as close as you can.
Look him straight in the eye.

And I think with my letter from my doctor,
that got me out.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.217
<i>Greetings</i> opened
in December,

09:51.300 --> 09:53.302
and was crucified in <i>The Times.</i>

09:53.386 --> 09:56.681
Fortunately what happened was,
the review was so bad,

09:56.764 --> 10:01.227
a guy wrote a reply
in <i>The Sunday Times,</i>

10:01.310 --> 10:02.728
which was huge,

10:02.812 --> 10:05.648
saying "Was that a way
to greet <i>Greetings?"</i>

10:05.731 --> 10:08.025
And then, at that same week,

10:08.109 --> 10:11.862
Pauline Kael's review came out
in <i>The New Yorker</i>

10:11.946 --> 10:14.782
and suddenly
the movie became a hit.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.243
I feel very strongly
about these political movies

10:17.326 --> 10:18.786
when I get into
that area.

10:18.869 --> 10:21.539
This— This clearly shows
that Officer [bleep]

10:21.622 --> 10:23.582
was in the front
and firing from the front

10:23.666 --> 10:26.460
with a Russian
6.76mm rifle, see.

7/8ths of an inch
below the collar button.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.384
[De Palma] And it's the very
anti-establishment,

10:33.467 --> 10:37.013
usually comedic in the case
of <i>Greetings and Hi, Mom!</i>

10:37.096 --> 10:39.849
You know, looking around
and saying, "This is crazy."

10:39.932 --> 10:41.809

10:41.892 --> 10:43.853
you know, when you took the book
and everything,

10:43.936 --> 10:46.105
it was amazing.
It was just beautiful.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.649
And it was what I called
a private moment, you see.

10:48.733 --> 10:50.484
And I study people
like this.

10:50.568 --> 10:52.295
[Rubin] Okay, now—
Now, don't you think you're hot?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.071
Don't you want
to go to bed now?

10:54.155 --> 10:56.115
- Ah, I'm tired.
- Yes, you're tired.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.843
- I'm tired. And I want to go.
- You want to go to sleep.

10:57.867 --> 11:01.078
So, don't you think you should
take off your dress?

11:01.162 --> 11:02.580
- Sure. Take it off.
- My dress?

11:02.663 --> 11:05.958
[Rubin] Remember, this is a private
moment, and no one is watching.

11:06.042 --> 11:09.754
[De Palma] Bobby emerged
as the most captivating character.

11:09.837 --> 11:13.424
We said let's— I think we've got
to make him like, the main character.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.426
This guy is fantastic.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.888
So, that's what happened
with <i>Hi, Mom!</i>

11:18.971 --> 11:21.182
which is basically a son
of <i>Greetings.</i>

11:21.265 --> 11:23.267
<i>♪ You're walking down the street ♪</i>

11:23.350 --> 11:25.603
<i>♪ And everyone you meet ♪</i>

11:25.686 --> 11:28.647
<i>♪ Is gonna step to the side... ♪</i>

11:28.731 --> 11:30.566
[De Palma] The whole idea
of <i>Be Black Baby</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:32.693
came as an environmental
theater piece.

11:32.777 --> 11:36.405
It was supposed to put you
through a race awakening...

11:36.489 --> 11:39.450
We want to take you through
the black experience.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.118
[De Palma]
...where you experience

11:41.202 --> 11:45.873
what black people experience
in America of the mid 60's.

11:45.956 --> 11:50.586
This is at the— the height of, you know,
Black Panthers,

11:50.711 --> 11:54.632
and, you know,
"burn, white guy, burn."

11:54.715 --> 11:56.842
These guys came up—
They were so scary,

11:56.926 --> 11:59.303
and they were so like,
"You motherfucker,

11:59.386 --> 12:02.014
what do you know about
race relations?"

12:02.098 --> 12:03.891
And then you go,
"Holy smackerel."

12:03.974 --> 12:05.935
So, I didn't rehearse them
with the troupe.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.604
When we shot the sequence
in that freight elevator,

12:08.729 --> 12:11.816
the other actors
had never seen them before.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.609
When the thing opens,
and they see us go on

12:13.734 --> 12:16.320
and grab her throat and throw her down
and start to rape her,

12:16.403 --> 12:20.366
everybody's like, "Oh, my God.
This is, like, really happening."

12:20.449 --> 12:22.243
Turn that fucking camera off!
Turn it off!

12:22.326 --> 12:24.453
Get it down!

12:24.537 --> 12:26.539
Get that camera down!

12:26.622 --> 12:28.958
[woman, sobbing]
Oh, please, stop.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.352
- [man] Shut the fuck up.
- [screams]

12:30.376 --> 12:32.044
My hair!

12:34.922 --> 12:37.842
[De Palma] I was in the back
of the elevator with Chuck, my producer,

12:37.925 --> 12:40.052
and I looked over to him,
he was like, terrified.

12:40.136 --> 12:41.762
And I had this big smile
on my face.

12:41.846 --> 12:43.764
So, I said,
"This is really working."

12:43.848 --> 12:45.558
[laughing]

12:45.641 --> 12:48.519
I'm going to tell all my friends
they've got to come.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.688
They really got to come.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.107
Except they should have
called it—

12:53.190 --> 12:55.192
- It was really something.
- "Humiliate The Honky"

12:55.276 --> 12:57.736
or "Hump The Honky."
But it was great theater.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.698
So, when I went to Hollywood,
at Warner Brothers,

13:00.781 --> 13:04.410
Marty was out there editing
<i>The Medicine Ball Caravan,</i>

13:04.493 --> 13:06.912
which was Woodstock
on wheels basically.

13:06.996 --> 13:09.039
I sort of introduced him around.

13:09.123 --> 13:10.499
There was Marty and I,

13:10.583 --> 13:13.127
then there was George
and Francis, and Steven.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.755
The thing about Steven, I think he was
the first person I ever saw

13:16.839 --> 13:18.299
that had a phone in his car.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.235
[Steven] I'm trying to call
Brian De Palma, New York City.

13:20.259 --> 13:24.054
Hello, Brian, this is Nancy
and Amy and Steve.

13:24.138 --> 13:25.598
- Hi, Brian.
- Hi, Brian.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.766
Happy Thanksgiving.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.643
It's 1976, Brian.

13:29.727 --> 13:33.314
We're photographing this
on 8mm sound film.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.791
And we want to say
happy Thanksgiving.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.135
Sorry you're not home
to enjoy it.

13:36.192 --> 13:38.402
[De Palma] Steven and I
were so close back then.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.780
This is the whole
Warner Brothers youth group.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.450
Schrader was out there.
Schrader was a critic.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.952
He brought me the script
of <i>Taxi Driver.</i>

13:47.036 --> 13:50.122
I didn't think it was commercial,
but it was extraordinary.

13:50.206 --> 13:52.583
And I thought it was more
to Marty's taste.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.126
That was basically our group.

13:54.210 --> 13:56.921
And we were all
very supportive of each other,

13:57.004 --> 13:59.465
and passing these scripts
back and forth

13:59.548 --> 14:01.342
and looking
at each other's movies.

14:01.425 --> 14:05.346
And what we did in our generation
will never be duplicated.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.766
We were able to get
into the studio system

14:08.849 --> 14:14.313
and use all that stuff in order to make
some pretty incredible movies

14:14.396 --> 14:16.899
before the businessmen
took over again.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.693
But I was making
my Hollywood movie now

14:19.777 --> 14:22.404
so I thought, "Well, wow,
I'm in the big time."

14:22.488 --> 14:24.073
It's this is sort of whimsical thing

14:24.156 --> 14:26.909
where a guy drops out of a corporation

14:26.992 --> 14:29.495
and he decides he's going
to change his life

14:29.578 --> 14:32.039
and become
a tap dancing magician.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.292
Tommy Smothers had just been
fired from his show

14:35.376 --> 14:38.963
because he did all these sort of anti-war
things and all this political humor.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.340
Our government is asking us
as citizens, good citizens

14:41.423 --> 14:46.178
to refrain from traveling
to foreign lands.

14:46.262 --> 14:49.181
Okay, all you guys in Vietnam,
come on home.

14:49.265 --> 14:52.768
This is this big kind of
anti-Establishment movie.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.105
So, I wanted to use Orson Welles
as the tap dancing magician instructor.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.941
I found that Orson Welles
was not learning his lines.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.651
We had cue cards
all over the place.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.695
And I'd never seen
this before.

15:02.778 --> 15:06.782
You just looked at him, you say,
"This isn't right. This is sloppy."

15:06.907 --> 15:10.244
I kept on shooting
until he knew the lines.

15:10.327 --> 15:14.665
To work that hard
would be unfair to your rabbit.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.209
Here's Brian De Palma dealing
with Orson Welles, you know,

15:17.293 --> 15:20.337
I'm in my 20's and I'm going,
"Holy mackerel.

15:20.421 --> 15:22.840
I'm telling Orson Welles
he's got to do this thing again."

15:22.923 --> 15:25.009
It's like, "Whoa!"

15:25.092 --> 15:27.553
You know, when I was working
in somebody else's material,

15:27.636 --> 15:28.929
I would try to direct it.

15:29.013 --> 15:33.559
I would try to find ways to make it work
within the way it was written.

15:33.642 --> 15:38.689
So, I didn't try to change it into
whatever my style was at the time.

15:38.772 --> 15:42.359
I basically tried to interpret
the material as best I could.

15:42.443 --> 15:45.529
And Smothers got disenchanted
with it very quickly.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.449
Wound up disliking me,
disliking the material,

15:48.532 --> 15:51.243
disliking the establishment
he was working for.

15:51.327 --> 15:53.787
Literally, one time he just left.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.248
Nobody could find him
for four or five days.

15:56.332 --> 15:59.043
We finished the movie
and it didn't work.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.879
And I had written a whole bunch of stuff
to make it work,

16:01.962 --> 16:05.132
but I said, "Hey, it's either
my way or the highway,"

16:05.215 --> 16:07.509
and I got on the highway
the next day.

16:07.593 --> 16:10.179
I was devastated.
I was finished.

16:10.262 --> 16:13.349
I mean, in my career I've had
these devastating things happen

16:13.432 --> 16:16.810
where you basically have to start
from scratch, and I was finished.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.897
So, I went back to New York
and we started making <i>Sisters.</i>

16:19.980 --> 16:21.982
<i>[screaming]</i>

16:23.442 --> 16:27.279
<i>Sisters,</i> I got the idea
from a picture in <i>Life Magazine.</i>

16:27.363 --> 16:31.700
They had these Russian Siamese
twin sisters called Masha and Dasha

16:31.784 --> 16:33.744
as they're sitting together
on a couch.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.871
One looking kind of gay
and happy,

16:35.996 --> 16:38.040
and the other one sort of
slumped over to the side,

16:38.123 --> 16:40.292
looking completely psychopathic.

16:40.376 --> 16:45.089
And the caption was, "Although
they're physiologically perfectly normal

16:45.172 --> 16:47.174
as they develop into adolescence,

16:47.257 --> 16:49.885
they're developing
certain mental problems."

16:50.010 --> 16:53.680
[narrator] Conjoined twins
called Siamese

16:53.764 --> 16:55.724
challenge life
with their first breath.

16:55.808 --> 16:57.243
[De Palma] There was nothing
easy about it.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.396
When we started with $150,000,
we were non-union.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.897
We were shooting
in Staten Island.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.482
We were on such tight budgets.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.042
I mean, you know,
it had to be all figured out.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.944
I'd rehearsed the stuff
with the girls.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.905
I mean, you know,
all the actors I knew.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.616
Charlie Durning,
I'd him put in <i>Hi, Mom!</i>

17:12.699 --> 17:13.951
It was his first movie.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.869
Finley, I'd worked
with many movies before.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.497
Jennifer Salt,
Margot Kidder.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.334
Who I was working with
essentially my repertory company.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.795
- You're the lady of the house?
- Yes, I am.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.630
- You live here alone?
- Yes.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.173
Have any company
this morning?

17:28.257 --> 17:29.800
- Oh, no.
- Well, a split screen

17:29.883 --> 17:34.972
I got from <i>Dionysus In '69,</i>
where I shot the narrative of a play

17:35.055 --> 17:38.892
and Bob Fury shot
the audience's involvement

17:38.976 --> 17:40.853
with the players and the play.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.229
And I got this idea,

17:42.312 --> 17:44.481
"Well, we'll show them
simultaneously."

17:44.565 --> 17:46.066
The thing about movies is

17:46.150 --> 17:49.319
that you're telling the audience
what to look at.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.947
When you— you know, cut to something,
you're saying, "Ooh!

17:52.072 --> 17:55.701
There's something important
going on here. Look at that."

17:55.784 --> 17:59.329
The thing about split screen
is the audience has a chance

17:59.413 --> 18:02.458
to sort of put two images
together simultaneously

18:02.541 --> 18:04.334
and something happens
in their head.

18:04.418 --> 18:08.714
You're giving them
a juxtaposition as opposed to this.

18:08.797 --> 18:13.594
Split screen is a technique
that can take you out of the experience.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.597
The idea is where
it is appropriate.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.724
In <i>Sisters,</i> of course,
it worked quite well.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.350
Can I get the blood
cleaned up

18:20.434 --> 18:22.853
before this— Jennifer
comes around with the police?

18:22.936 --> 18:24.188
Makes perfect sense to me.

18:24.271 --> 18:28.358
May be completely alien
to some other viewer,

18:28.442 --> 18:30.402
but you take something like
<i>Barry Lyndon.</i>

18:30.486 --> 18:33.280
I could see these
huge, slow zoom shots,

18:33.363 --> 18:36.116
and when I first saw the movie,
I disliked it intensely.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.286
After having seen it a couple
of more times, I can see that Kubrick—

18:39.369 --> 18:43.790
he's getting you into the time sense
of the period you're in.

18:43.874 --> 18:47.211
In order to get people
to understand this century,

18:47.294 --> 18:49.421
you have to <i>slow time.</i>

18:49.505 --> 18:51.256
To him, I'm sure
it makes perfect sense.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.175
To a guy that just
walked off the street,

18:53.258 --> 18:55.552
you say, "Oh, wait a minute.

18:55.636 --> 18:58.138
This is not like movies.
What is this?"

18:58.222 --> 19:02.017
And that's very much— some
of these techniques that I developed

19:02.142 --> 19:06.063
came from what looked like
perfectly logical way

19:06.146 --> 19:09.483
to portray what I was seeing
and feeling.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.568
♪♪

19:13.028 --> 19:16.114
When we were doing <i>Sisters,</i>
my editor, Paul Hirsch,

19:16.198 --> 19:20.160
laid a lot of Benny's stuff
from <i>Psycho</i> in a temp track.

19:20.244 --> 19:22.454
As we were looking at it,
it worked so well.

19:22.538 --> 19:25.082
We sort of looked at each other
and we said,

19:25.165 --> 19:27.376
"Where's
Bernard Herrmann now?"

19:27.459 --> 19:31.713
So, we brought him to New York
to look at the film.

19:31.797 --> 19:35.926
When he arrived, you know,
Benny's, you know, with his cane,

19:36.009 --> 19:40.305
and he's hunched over, and he's been
on a plane, and he's very grouchy.

19:40.389 --> 19:43.350
And he comes off the elevator
in Movielab and I, you know, said,

19:43.433 --> 19:45.978
"- Hello, Mr. Herrmann, it's an honor.
- Where's the movie?"

19:46.061 --> 19:47.938
Okay, so,
we go and we sit him down.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.483
Of course I had all this Bernard Herrmann
music on the temp track.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.486
So, of course,
as soon as he hears— [laughs]

19:54.570 --> 20:00.867
I forget what it was,
I think it was either <i>Vertigo</i> or <i>Psycho.</i>

20:00.951 --> 20:03.453
When he starts to hear the music,
he starts shrieking.

20:03.537 --> 20:06.290
He said,
"Stop the projector!

20:06.373 --> 20:10.586
Stop it, stop it!
I can't hear that!"

20:10.669 --> 20:13.797
And I said, "Oh, my God,"
so we stopped the projector.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.593
He says, "I can't look at your movie
and listen to that!"

20:17.676 --> 20:20.220
[laughing]

20:20.304 --> 20:24.266
So, we frantically pulled
all the temp track off

20:24.349 --> 20:27.019
and then played the movie
silent for him.

20:27.102 --> 20:31.523
So, we didn't have any score
on the movie for him to listen to.

20:31.607 --> 20:33.859
But he— he was scary.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.778
You don't sit there, you know,
going through note by note

20:36.862 --> 20:38.238
with the composer,
with Benny.

20:38.322 --> 20:40.907
He just—
He sees the movie

20:40.991 --> 20:42.659
and goes home
and writes the score.

20:42.868 --> 20:44.745
♪♪

20:50.667 --> 20:54.671
Consequently, having been involved
with so many movies that were not a hit,

20:54.755 --> 20:57.007
I was trying to make
a successful movie.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.907
about a year before
<i>The Rocky Horror Show.</i>

21:21.990 --> 21:23.325
Again, I just got this idea.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.911
I mean, just hanging around
and watching, you know,

21:25.994 --> 21:28.246
the whole
kind of music business.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.248
You know,
I was living in L.A.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.459
We were going
to the rock clubs

21:32.542 --> 21:34.503
where personalities
are so colorful.

21:34.586 --> 21:38.131
The idea came from Muzak
in an elevator,

21:38.215 --> 21:41.259
when I heard a Beatles song
in Muzak in the elevator.

21:41.343 --> 21:45.764
And I said, "You can take
something extremely original

21:45.847 --> 21:49.142
and turn it into syrup
and it's completely commercial."

21:49.226 --> 21:50.811
And the whole idea of Swan

21:50.894 --> 21:54.606
sort of taking the Phantom's
very original music

21:54.690 --> 21:57.818
and then, you know,
first you hear it as 50's rock and roll,

21:57.901 --> 22:01.238
then it's Beach Boys,
then it's horror rock.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.007
I mean, it just it doesn't
make any difference.

22:03.031 --> 22:06.618
You just— And you hear the same song
basically in three different forms.

22:06.702 --> 22:09.329
Mr. Paul Williams.

[De Palma] I don't know
how we came upon Paul,

22:15.043 --> 22:17.087
but the idea of him playing Swan—

22:17.170 --> 22:19.297
because he's such an interesting
looking character,

22:19.381 --> 22:22.843
and he was able to write
all these parodies of all these forms.

[De Palma] I always had the idea
of Finley playing the Phantom.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.733
Try it again.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.860
[electronic voice]
<i>Phoenix.</i>

23:21.943 --> 23:25.280
And he plays that kind of character
in <i>Woton's Wake</i> basically.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.782
And then I had
to find Phoenix,

23:26.865 --> 23:29.618
which, she turned out to be
a Sarah Lawrence student.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.495
And that's where
Jessica came from.

23:31.578 --> 23:34.247
The terrible thing about <i>Phantom</i> was,
when we finished it,

23:34.331 --> 23:36.792
we made it for about $1.2 million
or something,

23:36.875 --> 23:41.421
and Fox offered us $2 million to buy it
and I was like, "Holy mackerel."

23:41.505 --> 23:45.383
Unfortunately, we had not taken out
E&O insurance.

23:45.467 --> 23:48.011
So, we were hit with like,
four lawsuits immediately.

23:48.094 --> 23:51.139
Universal said we were infringing
on their <i>Phantom of the Opera.</i>

23:51.223 --> 23:53.642
I had a company
called Swan Song Records

23:53.725 --> 23:56.144
that was a name
of a real record company.

23:56.228 --> 23:58.063
Our picture
was called <i>Phantom.</i>

23:58.146 --> 24:00.774
We had to change that because
of the <i>Phantom</i> comic strip.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.317
It was very successful
in L.A.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.903
It was very successful
in Canada.

24:04.986 --> 24:08.824
In France, it played
for like, ten years.

24:08.907 --> 24:11.284
But, like, New York, it just died.

24:11.368 --> 24:14.788
I mean, I remember going to the theater
and, like, there was nobody there.

24:14.871 --> 24:18.250

24:27.592 --> 24:31.596
The whole coming about
of <i>Obsession</i> happened

24:31.680 --> 24:34.391
when Marty was working,
I think, on <i>Mean Streets,</i>

24:34.474 --> 24:36.685
and I was helping edit
one of the scenes,

24:36.768 --> 24:38.854
the scene where Bobby
comes into the bar

24:38.937 --> 24:41.147
and then he and Harvey talk
in the back room.

24:47.112 --> 24:49.698
[De Palma] Schrader came over
and began to play cards

24:49.781 --> 24:51.491
or Schrader lost
a whole bunch of money.

24:51.575 --> 24:53.261
And I said, "Come on,
I'll take you out to dinner."

24:53.285 --> 24:56.037
And that's when we got the idea
to do <i>Obsession,</i>

24:56.121 --> 24:57.455
because we'd both seen <i>Vertigo.</i>

24:57.539 --> 25:00.542
They'd recently shown it
at the L.A. County Museum.

25:00.625 --> 25:04.462
The first time it had been shown
in 20 years or something.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.131
I went home
and wrote up the story

25:06.214 --> 25:09.175
and then Schrader took it on
and did the script.

25:09.259 --> 25:10.886
The original script
of <i>Obsession,</i>

25:10.969 --> 25:13.263
which is called <i>Déjà Vu,</i>
was in three acts.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.056
And there's a whole act
in the future.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.933
So, I got rid of the third act,

25:17.017 --> 25:19.519
which Schrader always
was very unhappy with me.

25:19.603 --> 25:22.522
Well, the tough one was getting an actor
that could get it financed.

25:22.606 --> 25:23.982
And we were trying to get

25:24.065 --> 25:26.693
a kind of Hitchcockian
leading man in this.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.279
And finally, we managed to get
Cliff Robertson,

25:29.362 --> 25:31.948
which was not
my first choice,

25:32.032 --> 25:35.285
but that's, like, the best guy
we could get for the movie.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.954
And I think the weakness
of the movie is Cliff,

25:38.038 --> 25:40.624
and what— the greatness
of the movie is Genevieve.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.250
I mean,
she carries the movie.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.628
Cliff was very difficult to work with,

25:44.711 --> 25:48.798
and he did things
that I'd never thought were possible.

25:48.882 --> 25:51.176
He could see that Genevieve
was taking the movie over.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.929
I mean, we got to a part where
they could hardly work together

25:54.012 --> 25:56.431
because he was affecting
her performance.

25:56.556 --> 25:59.476
Not only not feeding
her lines well.

25:59.559 --> 26:03.396
"I love you, I feel very strongly
about this. You mean more"—

26:03.480 --> 26:07.442
I mean, literally, you know,
not giving her anything to work off of.

26:07.567 --> 26:10.195
He would just start doing this.

26:13.823 --> 26:16.201
So, her eyeline
would be like over here.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.744
Well, Vilmos lost his temper.

26:17.827 --> 26:20.389
Because, you know, Cliff always used
this kind of brown, you know,

26:20.413 --> 26:23.416
he looked like— Well, this is a guy
that's supposed to be haunted

26:23.500 --> 26:26.419
by the unfortunate death
of his wife.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.004
He's supposed to be pale.

26:28.088 --> 26:30.674
He's got this brown stuff
on his face.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.884
And I remembered
Vilmos grabbing him once

26:32.968 --> 26:36.262
and literally backing him up
into the mahogany wall,

26:36.346 --> 26:39.683
and saying, "You are the same color
as this wall.

<i>Dionysus</i> gave me the whole
split screen idea,

27:02.664 --> 27:07.085
and then I went on with the split diopter
idea from those split screens.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.461
I mean, I edited <i>Dionysus,</i>

27:08.545 --> 27:12.048
so I was constantly putting
two images against each other,

27:12.132 --> 27:14.402
and I thought, "Well, how can I do this
in a regular movie?"

27:14.426 --> 27:16.970
You're putting something
very big in the foreground

27:17.053 --> 27:21.433
juxtaposing it against some other piece
of information in the background.

27:21.516 --> 27:23.852
I used it in <i>Carrie,</i> too,
in the classroom,

27:23.935 --> 27:26.104
when Billy is reading his poem

at the back of the class.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.984
because the girls
are all very self-conscious.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.861
But the fact that we shot
like two days before

31:43.945 --> 31:47.782
with Sissy completely naked
doing all the close-ups,

31:47.907 --> 31:49.909
you know, with the blood
that comes down,

31:49.993 --> 31:52.078
so they figured,
"Hey, if Sissy can do it...

31:53.329 --> 31:54.580
we'll do it."

31:54.664 --> 31:57.083
- [all clamoring]
- Help.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.127
[De Palma] You know,
I get a lot of criticisms

31:59.210 --> 32:01.087
because of these
kind of juxtapositions,

32:01.170 --> 32:03.256
but to me
they seem perfectly logical.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.800
I mean, she has her period.
She's hysterical.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.511
She goes for help and the girls
basically, you know,

32:08.594 --> 32:10.513
beat her down
in the corner of the shower.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.766
[clamoring continues]

32:16.102 --> 32:18.021
[De Palma]
A very difficult scene to do.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.295
That's what Hitchcock
always said.

32:24.319 --> 32:27.322
I mean, it's always the run-up
to what happens that's interesting.

32:27.405 --> 32:31.617
And you obviously see in my movies,
the run-up goes on forever.

32:31.701 --> 32:33.244
[all chattering]

32:33.328 --> 32:34.954
[girl]
Yes, they did.

32:35.038 --> 32:37.582
[girl #2]
Yeah, that's fantastic.

32:40.293 --> 32:42.933
[De Palma] You know, many times
I'd be doing very complicated shots

32:42.962 --> 32:45.381
and nobody would understand
what I was doing.

32:45.465 --> 32:47.008
You know,
that figure eight shot

32:47.091 --> 32:49.177
where, you know, you go
with the ballots,

32:49.260 --> 32:50.845
brings you all the way up
to the side.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.555
You go over the top
of the blood

32:52.638 --> 32:55.600
then zoom back to Sissy
and she gets up.

32:55.683 --> 32:57.477
[announcer]
I give you Tommy Ross

32:57.560 --> 32:59.562
- and Carrie White!
- [all cheering]

33:01.689 --> 33:05.193
[De Palma]
That shot took a day to shoot.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.070
Literally, the head
of the studio came down

33:07.153 --> 33:08.863
and asked what the hell
I was doing.

33:08.988 --> 33:12.992
And it's like, "You want
to shoot this? Be my guest."

33:19.040 --> 33:22.168
I did grow up in an operating room.
I saw a lot of blood.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.420
My father was
an orthopedic surgeon.

33:24.504 --> 33:27.382
And I used to go to the hospital
and watch him operate.

33:27.465 --> 33:31.177
You can't imagine how much blood
is flying around in an operating room.

33:31.260 --> 33:34.847
With the sawing
and the wrestling

33:34.931 --> 33:36.891
and it's not
like eye surgery,

33:37.016 --> 33:38.643
it's really physical.

33:38.726 --> 33:43.356
You know, our movie blood was all
some kind of corn syrup and dye,

33:43.439 --> 33:45.274
this theatrically red.

33:45.358 --> 33:48.611
It isn't like what real blood is,
which is brownish,

33:48.694 --> 33:52.156
and, when it dries,
it's almost completely brown.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.242
[cacophony of voices]

34:13.636 --> 34:16.347
When Carrie starts to knock
everybody off,

34:16.431 --> 34:18.349
I shot the whole thing
in split screen.

34:18.433 --> 34:22.853
But what I discovered was, split screen—
it is not good for action.

34:22.937 --> 34:27.108
So, Paul Hirsch and I pulled out
a lot of the split screen.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.734
You see it occasionally.

34:28.818 --> 34:31.237
But it's not good for,
you know,

34:31.320 --> 34:33.489
action, reaction,
action, reaction.

34:33.572 --> 34:37.743
It's too much of an intellectual form,
basically.

34:37.827 --> 34:39.120
Endings are extremely important

34:39.203 --> 34:40.830
and that was one
of the great endings.

34:40.913 --> 34:44.000
In the wide shot, where you see
the traffic in the street

34:44.083 --> 34:47.503
and she walks down the side
and then goes into the graveyard—

34:47.587 --> 34:49.338
that we shot backwards.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.632
I wanted it
to look strangely odd.

34:51.716 --> 34:54.969
There was something strange about it,
but you're not exactly sure what.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.889
There was a similar sequence
in <i>Deliverance,</i>

34:57.972 --> 35:00.057
when Jon Voight dreams
about the bodies

35:00.141 --> 35:02.852
coming up from the lake
where he's buried them.

35:02.935 --> 35:06.314
I remember that was quite a—
quite a shocking moment.

35:08.107 --> 35:12.737
But that's the only thing, I think, that
could possibly have gotten me thinking

35:12.820 --> 35:16.115
about the hand out of the grave.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.126
[screams]

35:32.048 --> 35:36.010
The executives at United Artists
were very classy.

35:42.016 --> 35:43.684
They had <i>Rocky</i> that year.

35:43.768 --> 35:46.854
And <i>Carrie</i> was like...

35:46.938 --> 35:49.023
was like an AIP picture to them.

35:49.148 --> 35:50.358
It was like,

35:50.441 --> 35:52.276
"Well, it's— You know,

35:52.360 --> 35:55.071
we'll distribute it, but let's not talk
about it too much."

35:55.154 --> 35:56.155
[announcer]
<i>Carrie...</i>

35:56.239 --> 35:58.324
[screaming]

35:58.407 --> 35:59.951
<i>A new film
by Brian De Palma.</i>

36:00.034 --> 36:02.787
[De Palma] So, they put it a lot
in a bunch of theaters on Halloween,

36:02.870 --> 36:04.956
expecting it to play
for a week or so whatever.

36:05.039 --> 36:06.916
And then it made
a tremendous amount of money

36:06.999 --> 36:08.435
and they started to take it
more seriously.

36:08.459 --> 36:12.088
But I was always fighting for, you know,
money for the campaign.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.048
And against all odds,

36:14.173 --> 36:16.801
Sissy and Piper were both
nominated for Oscars.

36:16.884 --> 36:20.054
What's great about <i>Carrie</i> is they made
so many versions of it now,

36:20.179 --> 36:23.891
and they've made so many mistakes
that it's wonderful to see what happens

36:23.975 --> 36:25.726
when somebody takes
a piece of material

36:25.810 --> 36:28.271
and makes all the mistakes
that you avoided.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.649
♪ Carrie ♪

36:31.732 --> 36:36.904
♪ Why do they always
treat me so bad? ♪

36:36.988 --> 36:39.490
There's a three-hour
television version of <i>Carrie,</i>

36:39.573 --> 36:41.117
<i>which is exactly like the book.</i>

36:41.200 --> 36:44.412
Instead of crucifying
Mrs. White,

36:44.495 --> 36:46.622
they give her
a heart attack.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.541
And I remembered
in a script meeting saying,

36:48.624 --> 36:50.001
"This is what happened?

36:50.084 --> 36:52.545
She clutches her heart
and falls down?

36:52.628 --> 36:53.921
That's dramatic!"

36:54.005 --> 36:56.007
[laughing]

36:57.216 --> 36:59.552
That's where I came up
with the flying utensils.

37:00.845 --> 37:03.306
[screaming with each stab]

37:14.775 --> 37:17.695
Well, then I got offered
another studio picture.

37:17.778 --> 37:20.114
Or a couple—
Just different studios,

37:20.239 --> 37:22.408
and the best one I could get
was <i>The Fury.</i>

37:22.491 --> 37:24.243
Which suddenly had
a huge budget,

37:24.327 --> 37:27.621
which was like, $5 million
or something, unheard of,

37:27.705 --> 37:29.749
and we suddenly had
all these movie stars,

37:29.832 --> 37:31.917
you know, Cassavetes
and Kirk Douglas,

37:32.001 --> 37:35.546
and I said, "Wow, let's do this.
I've never done this before."

37:35.629 --> 37:38.049
Plus, we had a whole bunch
of charming girls in this.

37:38.132 --> 37:40.718
And even though
it's kind of not the movie

37:40.801 --> 37:43.554
you would have top
on your list to make...

37:45.181 --> 37:47.600
there were a lot of things in it
I really liked.

37:47.683 --> 37:50.311
I liked the scene
where Amy's on the steps

37:50.394 --> 37:53.230
and she touches the scar
in Charlie Durning's hand

37:53.314 --> 37:56.984
and then remembers Robin
being chased up there

37:57.068 --> 37:59.695
and going out the window.

37:59.779 --> 38:02.031
And I loved
the Johnny Williams score.

38:02.114 --> 38:04.158
I thought Johnny did
a great job with the score.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.494
That's one
of my favorite scores, that score.

38:08.204 --> 38:09.914
I had to do a car chase
in <i>The Fury.</i>

38:09.997 --> 38:12.041
I don't like car chases.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.085
I find them
a very boring thing.

38:14.168 --> 38:15.711
I'm not a car person.

38:15.795 --> 38:19.256
I don't get excited taking shots
of wheels turning,

38:19.340 --> 38:21.509
point of views
out of windshields

38:21.592 --> 38:25.638
or cars banging into—
It just doesn't do anything for me.

38:25.721 --> 38:28.599
You know, you're forced because
of the script to do certain things.

38:28.682 --> 38:30.285
You have to figure out,
how am I going to do this?

38:30.309 --> 38:31.769
And how
can I make it interesting?

38:31.852 --> 38:34.647
And after <i>The French Connection,</i>
there are no car chases.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.233
It's just ridiculous to even
think about doing a car chase.

38:37.316 --> 38:40.486
It's the best idea in the world.
Subway, car underneath.

38:40.569 --> 38:43.114
I mean, you know, there's not
a better idea than that.

38:43.197 --> 38:44.949
But I like—
I like Cassavetes

38:45.032 --> 38:47.326
and it was interesting
working with him.

38:47.410 --> 38:49.787
He hated a lot
of what he had to do.

38:49.870 --> 38:53.207
The only time that John
really sort of went ballistic

38:53.332 --> 38:55.835
was when we had to do
a body cast of him

38:55.918 --> 39:00.256
and stick him in all this gook
for the blowing up of himself.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.175
He hated that.
Drove him crazy.

39:03.259 --> 39:06.011
You know, it's on the page
and you gotta figure out how to do it.

39:06.095 --> 39:07.972
But it doesn't come from you,
essentially.

39:08.055 --> 39:11.016
You're basically directing
somebody else's ideas

39:11.100 --> 39:13.519
and you're trying to do
the best that you can.

39:13.602 --> 39:17.565
But it's not one of my favorite films
by a long shot.

39:17.648 --> 39:21.277
I'm Dennis Bird.
And this is my life.

39:21.360 --> 39:25.739
[De Palma] I had this idea
that the way to teach film

39:25.823 --> 39:28.534
would be to actually make
a low-budget feature.

39:28.617 --> 39:33.289
I decided to try this idea out
at Sarah Lawrence

39:33.372 --> 39:36.167
and see if I could just teach a class

39:36.250 --> 39:38.878
which consisted
of what you have to do

39:38.961 --> 39:41.881
in order to create
a motion picture feature.

39:41.964 --> 39:43.257
What's the point
of film school

39:43.382 --> 39:45.152
if you don't know how to make
a low-budget movie?

39:45.176 --> 39:47.571
Because that's what you're going to be
faced with eventually.

39:47.595 --> 39:50.723
I had this idea
based on stories about my family,

39:50.806 --> 39:54.143
and with the class
we developed the script.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.853
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hi.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.247
I thought it was just going to be,

39:57.271 --> 39:59.583
"Oh, we'll go to Sarah Lawrence
and we'll teach this, and—"

39:59.607 --> 40:01.192
Well, it was like
making a movie.

40:01.275 --> 40:05.029
I mean, it was just as exhausting
as when you make a movie.

40:05.112 --> 40:07.948
Hey! You're zonked out
in your own rushes.

40:08.032 --> 40:09.450
You realize
how dangerous that is?

40:09.533 --> 40:10.844
[De Palma]
We had to raise the money.

40:10.868 --> 40:12.119
And of course, as you know,

40:12.203 --> 40:14.181
when you're raising money
for independent features,

40:14.205 --> 40:17.166
you know, the tax shelter dentist
fell out at the ninth hour.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.376
And I called up Steven
and George and I said,

40:19.460 --> 40:21.587
"You guys are going to contribute
some money to this,

40:21.670 --> 40:25.591
because... the dentist
just fell out."

40:25.674 --> 40:28.135
I had a couple of people
offering to buy it.

40:28.219 --> 40:29.970
It only cost $300,000.

40:30.054 --> 40:31.865
I was trying to make a deal
with United Artists,

40:31.889 --> 40:36.477
but this was the great year of Cimino's
catastrophe over there.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.105
We finally made a deal with them
and they opened it up on 57th Street.

40:40.189 --> 40:42.858
It got some good reviews
and played for about two weeks.

40:42.942 --> 40:45.361
I bought
<i>The New York Times</i> ad.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.238
What's disappointing about
teaching film

40:47.321 --> 40:49.865
is that, you know, 99% of them
are going nowhere.

40:49.949 --> 40:52.326
Anybody that has a career,
it's a— It's a miracle.

40:53.452 --> 40:55.871
<i>Dressed to Kill</i> was a very hot script.

40:55.955 --> 40:59.959
And I sold the script for a million
dollars, which is like, "Holy mackerel."

41:00.042 --> 41:01.460
It all went
extremely well.

41:01.544 --> 41:03.587
The picture, you know,
previewed well.

41:03.671 --> 41:05.923
It's one of those pictures
where everything worked.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.676
You know, and sometimes I have
these ideas in my head

41:08.759 --> 41:12.555
and until they gel into a whole movie,
they sort of circle around.

41:12.638 --> 41:16.016
I'd written a script
based on the book <i>Cruising,</i>

41:16.100 --> 41:18.143
which ultimately
Billy Friedkin made.

41:18.227 --> 41:20.229
And then, you know,
from my days at Columbia,

41:20.312 --> 41:23.357
where my roommate and I used to go
to the Museum of Modern Art

41:23.482 --> 41:25.651
and look at the pictures
and the pretty girls,

41:25.734 --> 41:30.322
I got this idea of this pick-up
at the Museum of Modern Art.

41:30.406 --> 41:33.158
And you know, this dissatisfied,
you know, housewife

41:33.242 --> 41:35.744
and she's cruising along
and she gets picked up.

41:35.828 --> 41:37.913
And I think it came together
when I finally got

41:37.997 --> 41:40.165
the whole transsexual section of it.

41:40.249 --> 41:43.127
The idea of, "I'm a woman living
in a man's body."

41:43.210 --> 41:44.771
[man] <i>There's a lot
of macho things there.</i>

41:44.795 --> 41:47.631
<i>This is very common
among transsexuals. You find, um—</i>

41:47.715 --> 41:50.843
[De Palma] You know, it was sort
of perfect, kind of <i>Sisters,</i>

41:50.926 --> 41:53.053
the good half,
the bad half.

41:53.137 --> 41:55.306
The fact when
he gets aroused, you know,

41:55.389 --> 41:58.517
that means his penis is growing
and he can't be a woman.

41:58.601 --> 42:00.894
Do you find me attractive?

42:00.978 --> 42:02.896
Of course.

42:02.980 --> 42:04.231
Would you want
to sleep with me?

42:04.315 --> 42:05.774
[De Palma]
And he's got to stop

42:05.858 --> 42:08.319
whatever is making,
you know, him get aroused

42:08.402 --> 42:11.363
and of course, leads to him
murdering Angie.

42:13.616 --> 42:14.742
[gasps]

42:14.825 --> 42:16.702
[screaming]

42:18.746 --> 42:20.914
There's a big controversy over
<i>Dressed to Kill</i>

42:20.998 --> 42:23.500
because of my fight
with the ratings board.

taken off the set,

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:30.474
You know,
I was writing scripts.

01:03:30.558 --> 01:03:32.935
I was selling things.

01:03:33.019 --> 01:03:35.688
Some would get made.
Some wouldn't.

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:39.233
Then I got involved with developing
<i>Fatal Attraction.</i>

01:03:39.317 --> 01:03:41.861
I was not sold on the way
the script was going

01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:43.487
and I said, "I'm out."

01:03:43.571 --> 01:03:46.991
Fortunately,
about 24 hours later,

01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:49.076
somebody over at Paramount

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.287
suggested me to do
<i>The Untouchables.</i>

01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:55.791
Art developed the script
before I arrived

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:59.211
and the three of us
worked on the script after that.

01:03:59.295 --> 01:04:01.881
Well, first we had to find
Elliott Ness.

01:04:01.964 --> 01:04:03.466
And I wanted to use Don Johnson,

01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:05.259
because I knew Don

01:04:05.343 --> 01:04:07.678
and he was very big in <i>Miami Vice now.</i>

01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:10.306
And Art felt very strongly
about Kevin.

01:04:10.389 --> 01:04:13.476
And then I called Spielberg,

01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:16.395
I called Larry Kasdan,
who had all worked with Kevin before,

01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:19.565
to reassure me about— this guy's
going to carry the whole movie.

01:04:19.649 --> 01:04:24.111
So they said, "Yes, this guy's
going to be something. Feel confident."

01:04:24.195 --> 01:04:27.490
Then we had Bob Hoskins
playing Al Capone.

01:04:27.573 --> 01:04:28.908
And then we got Sean in,

01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:30.826
because Sean
is always looking for things

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.829

of his James Bond character.

You go out to dinner with him,

him, like, what? Since the mid-60's.

01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:43.190
On <i>The Untouchables,</i>
Bobby was not learning his lines.

01:05:43.274 --> 01:05:46.610
And I just went with him to—
when he was putting his make-up on,

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:51.282

again with him until he knew them.

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:54.160
Plus he had to put on some weight
to play Al Capone

01:05:54.243 --> 01:05:56.620
and he had his hair
shaved back.

01:05:56.704 --> 01:05:59.498

[De Palma] What's good about a sequence
for a composer

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:25.107

emotional in the music.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:34.992

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:19.730
And then, when he whispers to him
when he leaves,

01:13:19.813 --> 01:13:21.356
you know, about payback,

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.109
I think he whispered once
to him, "Television actor."

01:13:24.193 --> 01:13:26.195
[laughs]

01:13:29.907 --> 01:13:32.284
Good old Sean.
Very exciting to work with.

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:35.662
It— it was a very difficult movie
to make

01:13:35.746 --> 01:13:37.414
with the weather and the heat,

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:41.418
and to understand Vietnam,
you've got to understand the terrain.

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:42.878
You got to understand the heat.

01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.630
Once you get the heat,

01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:47.466
you can't imagine how that affects
the way you think.

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:50.761
Then Thailand, I built
the whole jungle set

01:13:50.844 --> 01:13:54.848
because, the jungle, you walk three paces
and you could be anywhere.

01:13:54.932 --> 01:13:57.017
There's no orientation
in the jungle.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.894
So, I said,
"Let's build a jungle set

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:01.230
and just basically move
the trees around."

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:03.482
And Dawn actually traveled
all the way there.

01:14:03.565 --> 01:14:06.777
I think she lasted about five hours
and got in a plane and went home.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.862
It was awful.

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:12.407
[screams]

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:14.034
[De Palma]
I wanted to have that sense

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:17.245
that if you thought things
were bad above ground,

01:14:17.329 --> 01:14:20.374
you should see what was going on
below ground.

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:23.710
And the only way to do that
is to crane directly down

01:14:23.794 --> 01:14:26.421
and show a cutaway of the tunnel

01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:30.258
and the threat moving through it,
like an ant colony.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.721
Well, Columbia made me
preview the movie,

01:14:34.805 --> 01:14:37.474
but the previews
don't really help much at all.

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:39.309
You get all this pressure
to do things,

01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:41.478
and, in retrospect,
you regret it terribly.

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:43.188
At the end of <i>Casualties of War</i>

01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:45.399
I took out a couple
of the interrogation scenes,

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.150
especially the one
where they—

01:14:47.234 --> 01:14:50.529
They ripped Michael apart
on the stand by the defense attorney.

01:14:50.612 --> 01:14:51.923
Isn't it true that what you went out to do

01:14:51.947 --> 01:14:54.717
is to figure out how to use this incident
to get the hell out of the infantry?

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:56.118
- [man] Objection.
- Can you find—

01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:57.494
And I took that thing out.

01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:59.913
I ultimately put it back
in the revised version.

01:14:59.997 --> 01:15:04.543
Because if you put anything that makes
the audience react too strongly,

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:05.919
they want you to take it out.

01:15:06.003 --> 01:15:08.171
My movies tend
to upset people a lot,

01:15:08.255 --> 01:15:11.758
so you can imagine the things
they're trying to take out of my movies.

01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:13.510
And I have to fight them
tooth and nail.

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:18.765
A preview for this kind of movie
really doesn't tell you anything.

01:15:18.849 --> 01:15:23.186
I mean, the material is <i>so emotional</i>
and <i>so depressing.</i>

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:24.855
What's a preview
going to tell you?

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:27.399
I don't want to see the movie?
It disturbed me too much.

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:29.359
I don't know what
to tell my friends?

01:15:29.443 --> 01:15:31.194
I find it hard
to look at it myself

01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:34.990
when you deal with material
that's very heartbreaking

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:38.326
and you got to go to a mix and look
at that stuff over and over again.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:39.953
It's like <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i>

01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:41.538
was on television the other day.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:43.381
There's an hour
of those poor guys, you know,

01:15:43.457 --> 01:15:45.375
just trying to adjust
to where they are.

01:15:45.459 --> 01:15:47.586
I mean, how do you look
at that movie?

01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:49.379
It's so upsetting.
Imagine making it.

01:15:49.463 --> 01:15:52.257
That's the feelings I have
on <i>Casualties of War.</i>

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.426
Pauline wrote
a great review.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:58.013
But it didn't do well and there were a lot
of mixed reviews, you know.

01:15:58.096 --> 01:15:59.514
Nobody went to see it.

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:04.936
It was a terrible disappointment after
all that work, and it was a lot of work.

01:16:07.105 --> 01:16:08.624
- [reporter 1] There he is.
- [reporter 2] There he is.

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:11.401
- [female reporter] Let's go!
- [all clamoring]

01:16:11.485 --> 01:16:13.737
[De Palma] People never thought
I understood the book.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.447
I understood the book perfectly.

01:16:15.572 --> 01:16:18.617
Warners came to me
with <i>Bonfire of the Vanities.</i>

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.660
And it was a chance
to go back to New York,

01:16:20.744 --> 01:16:22.329
make a big studio picture
and, you know,

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:25.123
you go to work sometimes
just so you don't have to think.

01:16:25.207 --> 01:16:27.584
You see, my problem with
<i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i> is,

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.754
it should have been like
<i>The Magnificent Ambersons.</i>

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:33.590
You know, Sherman McCoy
is basically an asshole

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:36.635
much like the lead character
in <i>Ambersons,</i>

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:40.430
who destroys everything
because of his arrogance.

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:42.641
And that's the way the movie
should've been.

01:16:42.724 --> 01:16:44.476
But then we wound up
with Tom Hanks,

01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:47.437
and so I think, "I'll take a gamble,
try to make him nicer."

01:16:47.521 --> 01:16:48.581
Just don't want to do anything stupid.

01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:51.441
If we keep our heads,
we'll be perfectly fine.

01:16:51.525 --> 01:16:53.044
[Maria Ruskin]
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sherman!

01:16:53.068 --> 01:16:54.778
We're in the middle
of a goddamn war zone

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:56.947
and you're worried about
doing the right thing?

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.366
[De Palma] I had all these
sort of thoughts in my mind.

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:01.618
This is a very big,
expensive movie.

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:04.412
I knew what could go wrong with it.

01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:06.915
It could go the way
of the Welles picture

01:17:06.998 --> 01:17:09.793
and it could also go the way
of <i>Sweet Smell of Success,</i>

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:11.962
the greatest picture
Mackendrick ever made

01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:13.773
and it basically put him out
of the business.

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:16.397
- You want some cheap, gruesome gags?
- You print them, don't you?

01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:19.761
<i>Bonfire</i> should have been
that tough, that cynical.

01:17:19.845 --> 01:17:23.014
But I said, "If I make that picture,
it's going to be a career ender."

01:17:23.098 --> 01:17:26.768
Like Welles,
like Mackendrick,

01:17:26.852 --> 01:17:28.895
I'm going to be
like, unemployable.

01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:31.273
And the irony is,
it still bombed.

01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:33.150
It should have been tougher, harder.

01:17:33.233 --> 01:17:35.735
Everybody that read the book
hated the movie.

01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:38.280
The problem of working
in the Hollywood system

01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:40.031
is the people are paid
a lot of money

01:17:40.115 --> 01:17:42.117
to get you to do
what they want you to do.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.827
That's why
they have those jobs.

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:45.620
And you can lose your way

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:48.165
and go along
with their concepts.

01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:53.503
I mean, I'd never seen stacks
of notes from the studio.

01:17:53.587 --> 01:17:56.715
That was like you know,
"Wow."

01:17:56.798 --> 01:18:01.011
I made a lot of compromises
and it was disaster.

01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:05.265
And Julie Salamon wrote
every move in it.

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:08.977
I feel the movie, by itself,
stands up perfectly fine.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.271
Nothing wrong with the movie,
just don't read the book.

I was leveled by the response
to <i>Bonfire of the Vanities.</i>

01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:19.613
Catastrophe.
Time to leave town.

01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:21.990
So, I got married.

01:18:22.073 --> 01:18:23.408
I had a child.

01:18:23.491 --> 01:18:25.577
And I went back to a genre

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:29.039
that I had developed
in the 70's.

I'm sorry.

01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:42.135
My wife made a deal at Universal

01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:45.430
for us to make
a movie together.

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:47.349
I had two ideas basically.

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:50.769
One was a multiple personality
character.

01:18:50.852 --> 01:18:52.437
And many years before,

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.774
I was having a relationship
with a woman that was married.

01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:59.152
And she used to come by
after work

01:18:59.236 --> 01:19:01.446
and, you know,
we would make love

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:03.289
and because she was tired,
she'd fall asleep.

01:19:03.323 --> 01:19:05.283
And I remember
watching her sleeping, thinking,

01:19:05.367 --> 01:19:08.578
"What would happen if I just let her
sleep all night?

01:19:08.662 --> 01:19:11.122
How would you explain that
to your husband?"

01:19:11.206 --> 01:19:13.458
Oh, my God.

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:17.212
But the problem was that
the Lolita Davidovich story,

01:19:17.295 --> 01:19:20.257
which should have been
the first story in <i>Raising Cain,</i>

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.133
not the John Lithgow story

01:19:22.217 --> 01:19:26.179
with the kidnapping children
and the multiple personalities.

01:19:26.263 --> 01:19:28.181
That's what's supposed
to emerge later.

01:19:28.265 --> 01:19:31.768
It should have started with her
going to the shop to buy the clocks.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:33.603
She meets Steven Bauer.

01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:36.022
But when I was putting
the movie together,

01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:39.317
the John Lithgow stuff
was so strong, and the sort of—

01:19:39.401 --> 01:19:41.778
I guess you'd say
soap opera love story

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:44.197
was not
the strongest element.

01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:48.618
I had to pull the whole John Lithgow stuff
forward into the movie.

01:19:48.702 --> 01:19:53.206
And that's why it has
a particular oddness to it.

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:55.917
Because it's not put together
the way it was conceived.

01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:59.004
I don't know why I always cast
John Lithgow as villains.

01:19:59.087 --> 01:20:03.425
It's like, why did Billy Wilder
always cast Fred MacMurray as a villain

01:20:03.508 --> 01:20:06.678
when everybody else wanted him
as the professor in <i>Flubber?</i>

01:20:06.803 --> 01:20:08.930
And it was all shot
in our backyard.

01:20:09.014 --> 01:20:13.184

outside the house and shooting.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:23.153
It was one of my most
financially successful movies,

01:20:23.236 --> 01:20:26.781
because I had, like, 10%
of the gross from the first dollar.

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:30.201
It's interesting to look at the movie now
because it's like a family album.

Dick Sylbert is one of the great
production designers,

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:35.892
a magical guy
to work with.

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:37.936
The idea of the club
being like a boat

01:21:38.019 --> 01:21:41.564
came from the first
exterior location we found,

01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:45.735
which was a nightclub that was
in the shape of a boat.

01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:48.947
So then Dick designed the interior
to go with that exterior.

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:51.950
And of course what happened was
that we lost the location.

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:54.577

that boat-like exterior,

how they interact with each other.

01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:54.053
Because when you're on a set,
you're basically concentrating

01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:07.773

you know, like,

01:32:07.857 --> 01:32:11.068
"What are we going to have, helicopters
flying into tunnels or something?"

01:32:11.152 --> 01:32:14.363
I mean, brushing off
all these pyrotechnics

01:32:14.447 --> 01:32:18.284
as some kind of cheap
action sequence

01:32:18.367 --> 01:32:22.121
that had no emotional
or character thrust to it.

01:32:22.204 --> 01:32:25.958
So, we were basically
sort of arguing in front of Tom,

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.502
and I finally said,
"Okay, guys.

01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:31.005

this helicopter and tunnels and trains.

three-character scene in the boxcar.

And I sort of left.

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:49.273
And Tom basically decided

01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:53.444
that he thought that maybe
the action end of the movie

01:32:53.569 --> 01:32:55.446
would be better
than the boxcars.

01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:58.866
So, we had an abbreviated scene
in the boxcar.

01:32:58.949 --> 01:33:02.703

and did the end sequence.

is that when you're dealing with

$30 or $40 million or something.

It cost 100.

That's another situation

01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:46.463
