16:07.040 --> 16:08.760
<i>Well, I do remember him...</i>

<i>...but I'm sorry.</i>

16:13.240 --> 16:15.480

<i>He had the voice of an angel.</i>

16:26.760 --> 16:28.880
<i>He had a real gift.</i>

<i>Bobby spoke quite lovingly

16:33.440 --> 16:35.520

<i>He'd wet himself.</i>

16:49.840 --> 16:53.280
<i>I took him to the school nurse
to get a fresh pair of trousers.</i>

16:54.560 --> 16:56.000
<i>She saw the welts.</i>

16:56.960 --> 16:59.280
<i>He'd been beaten, badly.</i>

17:00.880 --> 17:02.400
<i>That set off alarm bells,</i>

17:02.400 --> 17:05.200
<i>the nurse told the deputy head,

17:08.600 --> 17:10.280

17:10.280 --> 17:11.800
<i>What about his father?</i>

<i>A court order stopped him

<i>I don't know exact details.</i>

<i>The deputy head would have,

17:25.640 --> 17:28.000
<i>Bobby became withdrawn.</i>

17:28.000 --> 17:30.600
<i>And then his father was killed

<i>His father was killed?</i>

17:32.200 --> 17:35.280
<i>Something in his work,

23:32.760 --> 23:36.480
<i>then when he invited you
to his 40th birthday,</i>

23:36.480 --> 23:38.880
<i>you didn't even reply to him.</i>

23:40.840 --> 23:42.720
<i>That hurt him.</i>

23:45.600 --> 23:47.360
<i>That hurt him a lot.</i>

23:50.840 --> 23:52.600
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:56.800 --> 23:58.400
<i>How?</i>

23:59.800 --> 24:01.360
<i>What happened?</i>

24:04.640 --> 24:06.800
<i>A pedestrian crossing.</i>

24:08.000 --> 24:09.720
<i>You know what Boyd was like.</i>

24:09.720 --> 24:14.120
<i>He had right of way,
and he stepped in front of a big...</i>

24:15.160 --> 24:16.920
<i>...a big bastard SUV, and...</i>

24:16.920 --> 24:19.480
<i>Oh, God, Mel, I'm so sorry.</i>

24:22.440 --> 24:26.960
<i>Um... so, Bobby Morgan,
I had a look. Yeah?</i>

24:26.960 --> 24:30.880
<i>Right, he was abused by his dad,
and then I put him into care,</i>

24:30.880 --> 24:33.160
<i>took a court order out
to keep him away from his dad,</i>

24:33.160 --> 24:35.120
<i>and... gave him back to his mum.</i>

24:35.120 --> 24:37.040
<i>Right.</i>

24:37.040 --> 24:38.960
<i>Can I see the red edges?</i>

24:38.960 --> 24:40.920
<i>No, course you can't.</i>

24:42.080 --> 24:44.360
<i>You can't read the files,
you don't work for us any more.</i>

24:44.360 --> 24:46.440
<i>You know the rules.
Yeah, yeah.</i>

24:50.640 --> 24:53.000
<i>Now, tell me...</i>

24:53.000 --> 24:55.520
<i>why you need to know
about Bobby Morgan?</i>

25:18.200 --> 25:21.760
<i>So, I have a case meeting,
I'll be half an hour.</i>

25:21.760 --> 25:23.640
<i>You gonna be all right in here
by yourself?</i>

25:23.640 --> 25:25.360
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:25.360 --> 25:27.080
<i>Thanks.</i>

25:27.080 --> 25:28.920
<i>Mm.</i>

25:45.880 --> 25:48.000
<i>PHONE RINGING TONE</i>

25:48.000 --> 25:51.320
<i>'DI Ruis.'
DC Hegarty, sir.</i>

25:51.320 --> 25:53.000
<i>Yeah, I followed O'Loughlin, yeah,</i>

25:53.000 --> 25:54.960
<i>to the Liverpool social services office.</i>

25:54.960 --> 25:59.200
<i>'He's in with a Melinda Cossimo.
She's one of their social workers.'</i>

25:59.200 --> 26:00.520
<i>Well, wait until he comes out</i>

26:00.520 --> 26:02.760
<i>and then see what he was doing
in there, all right?</i>

26:02.760 --> 26:06.240
<i>So, yesterday was a... school
and the town hall?</i>

26:06.240 --> 26:10.160
<i>Yeah.
Always asking about a Bobby Morgan.</i>

26:10.160 --> 26:14.080
<i>Yeah, he might be trying
to build a false narrative.</i>

26:14.080 --> 26:16.360
<i>I'm coming up to Liverpool.</i>

26:16.360 --> 26:18.840
<i>I just... I wanna be there
when he slips up.</i>

26:18.840 --> 26:20.160
<i>We'll be there tomorrow.</i>

26:20.160 --> 26:22.840
<i>'In the meantime, keep on him.'</i>

26:22.840 --> 26:24.840
<i>Will, do, sir.</i>

26:31.120 --> 26:34.840
<i>CAMERA CLICKS</i>

26:38.040 --> 26:42.320
<i>Yeah... it all points
to sexual abuse from the father.</i>

26:43.520 --> 26:45.840
<i>I didn't get a hint of that
in any of my sessions with Bobby.</i>

26:45.840 --> 26:48.680
<i>He adored his dad.
Well, you know how abusers work.</i>

26:48.680 --> 26:50.280
<i>Yeah...</i>

26:50.280 --> 26:53.640
<i>Yeah, I know there's nothing
to stop an abuser being a...</i>

26:53.640 --> 26:56.680
<i>safe, loving figure, but...</i>

26:57.800 --> 26:59.040
<i>I mean, it could be the reason</i>

26:59.040 --> 27:01.720
<i>why Bobby needs so many different
personalities to survive.</i>

27:03.240 --> 27:05.080
<i>I just don't see how I missed it.</i>

27:06.320 --> 27:08.280
<i>I mean, look at this, right?</i>

27:10.120 --> 27:12.960
<i>Lenny Morgan's first wife died.</i>

27:12.960 --> 27:15.160
<i>They had a son, Dafydd.</i>

27:15.160 --> 27:17.560
<i>Why has he never come to
the attention of social services?</i>

27:17.560 --> 27:19.360
<i>Why was he never interviewed
about Lenny?</i>

27:19.360 --> 27:21.280
<i>Well, we tried,</i>

27:21.280 --> 27:25.760
<i>but he was older than Bobby,
he was...</i>

27:25.760 --> 27:27.960
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:27.960 --> 27:30.320
<i>There. He was 16 at the time.</i>

27:30.320 --> 27:34.120
<i>He left home,
we needed to establish why,</i>

27:34.120 --> 27:37.440
<i>tracked him to Southern Australia,
to a backpacker's hostel,</i>

27:37.440 --> 27:39.440
<i>but he'd left, he'd disappeared.</i>

27:39.440 --> 27:40.800
<i>Hmm.</i>

27:42.200 --> 27:44.920
<i>What was Bobby's mother like?
Oh...</i>

27:44.920 --> 27:47.080
<i>It was 13 years ago.</i>

27:48.200 --> 27:50.520
<i>What I do know is that...</i>

27:50.520 --> 27:53.800
<i>Bobby showed all the classic signs
of being abused.</i>

27:53.800 --> 27:56.080
<i>Do you wanna look at this?
Yeah.</i>

27:56.080 --> 27:59.240
<i>These are Bobby's filmed interviews.</i>

27:59.240 --> 28:00.640
<i>Hmm.</i>

28:00.640 --> 28:02.320
<i>If this thing still works.</i>

28:24.640 --> 28:26.280
<i>'Now, Bobby,
I've a few questions</i>

28:26.280 --> 28:27.320
<i>'to ask you, is that OK?'</i>

28:27.320 --> 28:29.120
<i>I wanna go home.</i>

28:30.160 --> 28:36.360
<i>'Bobby, do you know the difference
between the truth and a lie?'</i>

28:37.400 --> 28:39.240
<i>That's me.</i>

28:39.240 --> 28:41.400
<i>That's my voice!</i>

28:44.080 --> 28:46.360
<i>But it wasn't my case,
I-I'd have remembered him.</i>

28:46.360 --> 28:49.640
<i>Well, you must have sat in
for someone just for that session.</i>

28:51.920 --> 28:53.360
<i>Erskine.</i>

28:53.360 --> 28:55.760
<i>It was his case.
Yeah, but I'm involved.</i>

28:55.760 --> 28:56.800
<i>In what?</i>

28:56.800 --> 28:58.120
<i>I don't know, I-I...</i>

28:58.120 --> 29:00.400
<i>I couldn't have spoken to him
for more than 20 minutes,</i>

29:00.400 --> 29:01.680
<i>13 years ago!</i>

29:01.680 --> 29:03.680
<i>Everything that he was going through,</i>

29:03.680 --> 29:06.280
<i>you would have just been
another face in the crowd,</i>

29:06.280 --> 29:08.320
<i>he wouldn't have remembered you.</i>

29:10.040 --> 29:12.360
<i>Joe, you know
that you cannot use anything</i>

29:12.360 --> 29:14.360
<i>that you have found out today.</i>

29:14.360 --> 29:16.040
<i>Absolutely nothing. Yeah.</i>

29:16.040 --> 29:17.760
<i>Is that clear?
Mm-hm.</i>

29:17.760 --> 29:19.440
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:23.760 --> 29:26.360
<i>GRINDING</i>

29:30.480 --> 29:32.400
<i>Excuse me!</i>

29:32.400 --> 29:34.360
<i>Er... sorry to disturb you, um...</i>

29:34.360 --> 29:36.600
<i>I was wondering if there was
anything you could tell me</i>

29:36.600 --> 29:37.800
<i>about a Lenny Morgan.</i>

29:37.800 --> 29:40.240
<i>Lenny Morgan, Christ,
that's going back a bit.</i>

29:40.240 --> 29:42.280
<i>Anything, anything at all.</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:44.720
<i>Bert McMullen,
that's who you need to talk to.</i>

29:44.720 --> 29:46.840
<i>Him and Lenny were great mates.</i>

29:46.840 --> 29:48.280
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

29:48.280 --> 29:50.360
<i>HE CHUCKLES
In the pub.</i>

30:00.680 --> 30:02.360
<i>Dave.</i>

30:02.360 --> 30:03.480
<i>Ta, mate.</i>

30:11.280 --> 30:14.560
<i>I'll get that... if you don't mind?</i>

30:15.640 --> 30:17.600
<i>It's Bert, right?</i>

30:17.600 --> 30:21.280
<i>I was just at the bus depot,
they said I might find you here.</i>

30:22.440 --> 30:24.880
<i>You were a friend of Lenny Morgan's?</i>

30:24.880 --> 30:27.120
<i>There you go.</i>

30:27.120 --> 30:30.400
<i>I'm trying to help out Lenny's son, Bobby.</i>

30:30.400 --> 30:32.920
<i>He's in a spot of bother. Cheers.</i>

30:36.120 --> 30:37.480
<i>Ta.</i>

30:37.480 --> 30:39.800
<i>What sort of bother?</i>

30:39.800 --> 30:40.960
<i>Assault.</i>

30:40.960 --> 30:43.280
<i>He could go to prison.</i>

30:44.680 --> 30:46.680
<i>I'm looking into anything
to help him.</i>

30:46.680 --> 30:48.760
<i>Family background, friends...</i>

30:48.760 --> 30:51.680
<i>I haven't seen him
since he was a kid.</i>

30:53.840 --> 30:55.920
<i>He was a clever little boy.</i>

30:57.280 --> 30:59.280
<i>Lenny used to bring him
to the depot.</i>

30:59.280 --> 31:00.920
<i>Bobby worshipped his dad.</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:03.680
<i>Yeah. I got that impression.</i>

31:05.440 --> 31:08.120
<i>I've dug around a little bit,
and I know...</i>

31:08.120 --> 31:11.280
<i>Lenny was killed in a fire or...</i>

31:11.280 --> 31:14.040
<i>some kind of explosion
or something, but...</i>

31:14.040 --> 31:16.600
<i>So, why'd you need me, then?</i>

31:17.680 --> 31:19.840
<i>Yeah, er, sorry,
I haven't introduced myself,</i>

31:19.840 --> 31:21.840
<i>I'm-I'm Joe, er...</i>

31:21.840 --> 31:24.320
<i>I'm a psychologist. I'm wor...
Oh, fuck, no. Go home.</i>

31:24.320 --> 31:26.160
<i>Your mother's got custard waiting
for you.</i>

31:29.240 --> 31:31.400
<i>The thing is, Bert,</i>

31:31.400 --> 31:33.560
<i>if Bobby...</i>

31:33.560 --> 31:36.280
<i>was traumatised by the death
of his father,</i>

31:36.280 --> 31:37.400
<i>it could help mitigate...</i>

31:37.400 --> 31:40.040
<i>"Traumatised"? Fuck off.</i>

31:40.040 --> 31:42.240
<i>We were all of us that.</i>

31:43.400 --> 31:46.800
<i>We could have all done
with a bit of "mitigating".</i>

31:49.880 --> 31:51.800
<i>Cheers to that.</i>

31:54.880 --> 31:56.920
<i>Can you tell me
about Bobby's family?</i>

31:58.240 --> 32:00.280
<i>He has difficultly talking
about them.</i>

32:00.280 --> 32:01.840
<i>What was Lenny like?</i>

32:01.840 --> 32:03.560
<i>He was a lovely man.</i>

32:04.880 --> 32:06.520
<i>He was an engineer.</i>

32:06.520 --> 32:09.320
<i>Lenny used the depot workshop
of a weekend,</i>

32:09.320 --> 32:11.640
<i>um... to build his inventions.</i>

32:12.840 --> 32:14.800
<i>He was a brilliant welder.</i>

32:16.520 --> 32:17.960
<i>Bert, what happened to Lenny?</i>

32:17.960 --> 32:22.200
<i>The blast knocked an eight-tonne bus
on its side.</i>

32:23.600 --> 32:25.840
<i>The acetylene tank blew a hole
through the roof.</i>

32:25.840 --> 32:28.800
<i>They found it a 100 yards away. Jesus.</i>

32:28.800 --> 32:30.880
<i>He died on the way to hospital.</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:33.640
<i>It was written up...</i>

32:34.800 --> 32:36.640
<i>...as an accident.</i>

32:38.760 --> 32:40.080
<i>What do you think?</i>

32:40.080 --> 32:41.560
<i>He was hounded to death.</i>

32:42.600 --> 32:45.160
<i>Why was that?
Because of what happened to Bobby?</i>

32:45.160 --> 32:46.840
<i>Lenny killed himself.</i>

32:48.120 --> 32:50.840
<i>Everybody knew it, no-one said it.</i>

32:52.120 --> 32:54.240
<i>I should have helped him,</i>

32:54.240 --> 32:58.240
<i>but when someone
gets tagged a paedo,</i>

32:58.240 --> 33:00.040
<i>you don't, do you?</i>

33:04.880 --> 33:07.360
<i>And were they right? Did he...?</i>

33:08.680 --> 33:10.360
<i>Course not.</i>

33:11.520 --> 33:13.280
<i>Let me get you another pint, Bert...</i>

33:14.680 --> 33:16.000
<i>Mate, I'm so sorry.</i>

33:16.000 --> 33:17.440
<i>Fucking drunk...
I didn't see it.</i>

33:17.440 --> 33:18.920
<i>It was just clumsy.
I'll get you...</i>

33:18.920 --> 33:20.360
<i>Clumsy?
I'm sorry.</i>

33:20.360 --> 33:21.640
<i>Ooh.
JOE GRUNTS</i>

33:21.640 --> 33:24.560
<i>Now, you're fucking clumsy.</i>

33:27.720 --> 33:28.920
<i>JOE GROANS</i>

33:37.440 --> 33:40.600
<i>'And tragedy today
at a Liverpool bus depot.</i>

33:40.600 --> 33:43.240
<i>'A man thought to be
in his late forties...'</i>

33:43.240 --> 33:44.840
<i>'Did he abandon you?'</i>

33:44.840 --> 33:46.880
<i>Abandon?</i>

33:46.880 --> 33:49.080
<i>Joe, you know nothing about him.</i>

34:31.040 --> 34:32.640
<i>He's inside.</i>

34:32.640 --> 34:35.160
<i>Did Catherine ever mention a Bobby?</i>

34:35.160 --> 34:38.520
<i>A Bobby Morgan or... a Bobby Moran?</i>

34:38.520 --> 34:39.800
<i>No.</i>

34:39.800 --> 34:43.320
<i>And I don't feel comfortable
with you being here.</i>

34:43.320 --> 34:46.760
<i>Carl, I just told you,
the police released me.</i>

34:46.760 --> 34:47.800
<i>It was a wrongful arrest.</i>

34:47.800 --> 34:49.440
<i>I'm trying to find out
what happened...</i>

34:49.440 --> 34:50.720
<i>You abused Catherine.</i>

34:50.720 --> 34:53.000
<i>No, I didn't.
Catherine was ill.</i>

34:53.000 --> 34:54.560
<i>She withdrew the complaint.</i>

34:54.560 --> 34:56.560
<i>I was helping her
with some serious issues,</i>

34:56.560 --> 34:58.960
<i>and I want wanna help her now.
A little late for that.</i>

34:58.960 --> 35:00.680
<i>I don't think it's too late.</i>

35:00.680 --> 35:02.600
<i>I think it's important
how she's remembered.</i>

35:02.600 --> 35:04.360
<i>She deserves some dignity.</i>

35:04.360 --> 35:07.160
<i>The police, Carl,
have handled this so badly,</i>

35:07.160 --> 35:10.480
<i>I'm here to try
to find out the truth.</i>

35:12.520 --> 35:14.920
<i>Now, when I knew Catherine,
she kept a journal.</i>

35:14.920 --> 35:16.360
<i>She was religious about it,</i>

35:16.360 --> 35:18.240
<i>no matter what she was going through.</i>

35:18.240 --> 35:20.480
<i>Do you have any idea
if she still kept one or...</i>

35:20.480 --> 35:22.000
<i>where it might be?</i>

35:23.440 --> 35:25.600
<i>It might really help
in finding her killer, Carl.</i>

35:25.600 --> 35:27.640
<i>Police turned the house upside down.</i>

35:29.480 --> 35:33.640
<i>If they found a journal or whatever,
they didn't say.</i>

35:35.240 --> 35:36.760
<i>All right.</i>

35:41.080 --> 35:42.800
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

35:42.800 --> 35:45.560
<i>There's just one more thing...</i>

35:46.720 --> 35:49.200
<i>It was a London agency</i>

35:49.200 --> 35:51.960
<i>that dealt with the recruitment
of the receptionist job.</i>

35:51.960 --> 35:53.960
<i>She was up in Liverpool.</i>

35:53.960 --> 35:55.760
<i>Do you know how she found out
about it?</i>

35:56.680 --> 36:00.120
<i>A letter.
I don't know who from.</i>

36:00.120 --> 36:02.440
<i>She wasn't sure about applying,</i>

36:02.440 --> 36:06.000
<i>but the guy who she was seeing
convinced her to go for it.</i>

36:06.000 --> 36:07.920
<i>Who was that?</i>

36:07.920 --> 36:10.320
<i>Her secret London lover.</i>

36:11.400 --> 36:14.400
<i>I think he wanted her
to move down there.</i>

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
<i>They met a few years ago</i>

36:16.400 --> 36:19.560
<i>when he was working
at a hospital up here.</i>

36:19.560 --> 36:22.480
<i>Consultant, doctor, nurse?</i>

36:23.480 --> 36:24.600
<i>A doctor.</i>

36:24.600 --> 36:28.400
<i>She joked that he was...
good with his hands.</i>

36:30.160 --> 36:31.960
<i>Rich, poor?</i>

36:31.960 --> 36:34.480
<i>She'd meet him at hotels.</i>

36:34.480 --> 36:36.200
<i>Rich, then.</i>

36:36.200 --> 36:37.480
<i>Probably no children.</i>

36:37.480 --> 36:40.240
<i>Do you know if they met
on weekdays or weekends?</i>

36:40.240 --> 36:42.000
<i>Weekends.</i>

36:42.000 --> 36:43.680
<i>Definitely no children.</i>

37:07.160 --> 37:09.400
<i>Welcome to Liverpool,
Detective Inspector.</i>

37:09.400 --> 37:10.560
<i>Sergeant.</i>

37:10.560 --> 37:13.360
<i>I followed him around here
from his hotel, but...</i>

37:13.360 --> 37:15.040
<i>he didn't go straight in.</i>

37:15.040 --> 37:17.240
<i>He walked past the house
three or four times.</i>

37:18.200 --> 37:19.360
<i>Er...</i>

37:22.960 --> 37:24.440
<i>Keep on him, yeah?</i>

37:24.440 --> 37:26.840
<i>Everywhere he goes
and everyone he sees.</i>

37:26.840 --> 37:28.920
<i>Yes, boss.
Good man.</i>

37:30.760 --> 37:33.840
<i>I knew his trail
would lead us to Catherine.</i>

37:35.880 --> 37:40.080
<i>So, he said,
"She was religious about it?"</i>

37:40.080 --> 37:44.080
<i>He was certain she kept a journal,
and that he needed to find it.</i>

37:44.080 --> 37:46.640
<i>And you told him you knew nothing
about it.</i>

37:47.680 --> 37:48.960
<i>Because I don't.</i>

37:52.560 --> 37:56.640
<i>What's the last image you have
of Catherine?</i>

37:58.920 --> 38:01.520
<i>Was she smiling?</i>

38:01.520 --> 38:05.160
<i>Walking into the room?
Eating breakfast? Laughing?</i>

38:06.480 --> 38:08.880
<i>Yeah, she was over by the...</i>

38:08.880 --> 38:10.680
<i>the window...</i>

38:10.680 --> 38:13.280
<i>um... arranging flowers.</i>

38:15.680 --> 38:16.880
<i>She was happy.</i>

38:16.880 --> 38:19.480
<i>You see, the last image we have
of Catherine</i>

38:19.480 --> 38:22.600
<i>is lying dead on a mortuary slab.</i>

38:22.600 --> 38:26.640
<i>This was a horrible,
sadistic, brutal murder!</i>

38:26.640 --> 38:29.840
<i>Now, if she was "religious"
about keeping a journal,</i>

38:29.840 --> 38:31.040
<i>there'd be a journal!</i>

38:32.080 --> 38:34.040
<i>Where is it?</i>

38:34.040 --> 38:35.600
<i>Listen...</i>

38:36.760 --> 38:40.160
<i>...perverting the course of justice
is an automatic prison sentence,</i>

38:40.160 --> 38:43.920
<i>and, believe me, you have no idea</i>

38:43.920 --> 38:47.040
<i>what prison would be like
for someone like you.</i>

38:50.040 --> 38:51.920
<i>I didn't think it was important.</i>

38:54.680 --> 38:57.840
<i>Catherine hadn't paid her share
of the rent, right?</i>

38:57.840 --> 39:01.120
<i>She was always late, always.</i>

39:02.720 --> 39:05.760
<i>I just got fed up with it.</i>

39:05.760 --> 39:07.480
<i>So, um...</i>

39:08.640 --> 39:12.520
<i>...when she was out, I, er...
took her laptop.</i>

39:14.280 --> 39:17.080
<i>I was going to tell her
she could have it back</i>

39:17.080 --> 39:19.000
<i>if she just paid up, you know?</i>

39:19.000 --> 39:21.160
<i>But she didn't come back.</i>

39:22.960 --> 39:25.520
<i>And where is this laptop?</i>

39:27.600 --> 39:30.600
<i>It's just in the cupboard outside.</i>

39:30.600 --> 39:32.040
<i>Shall I?</i>

39:32.040 --> 39:33.880
<i>Yeah, please, go and get it!</i>

<i>Jesus, what happened to your face?
Did you get it?</i>

40:05.720 --> 40:06.920
<i>Here.</i>

40:10.120 --> 40:11.800
<i>What's this about, Joe?</i>

40:13.680 --> 40:18.440
<i>When Catherine applied
for the job of receptionist, she...</i>

40:19.680 --> 40:21.880
<i>I-I shredded her application
without reading it.</i>

40:21.880 --> 40:23.320
<i>I-I panicked. I...</i>

40:23.320 --> 40:25.600
<i>I saw her photograph,
and I just...</i>

40:25.600 --> 40:26.960
<i>I couldn't deal with it.</i>

40:26.960 --> 40:29.320
<i>Such a credit to the profession.</i>

<i>You're right, though,</i>

40:31.160 --> 40:33.080
<i>Meena kept copies of everything.</i>

40:33.080 --> 40:34.920
<i>Best receptionist
to ever walk out on us.</i>

40:34.920 --> 40:37.560
<i>I still can't deal with it,
can you read it out to me, please?</i>

40:38.680 --> 40:41.720
<i>Which part?
Doesn't matter.</i>

40:41.720 --> 40:44.840
<i>Well, I always skip the irritating,

<i>Show me.</i>

<i>That's Jack.</i>

41:06.920 --> 41:09.240
<i>Catherine was seeing Jack.</i>

41:09.240 --> 41:12.440
<i>He's involved in this somehow.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.080
<i>Yeah, yeah, he was best man

41:20.320 --> 41:22.640

41:22.640 --> 41:25.200
<i>Why do you call him Jack
if his name's Gerald?</i>

41:25.200 --> 41:27.360
<i>It's nickname Jack,
"Jack The Lad".</i>

41:27.360 --> 41:28.800
<i>He was always chasing women.</i>

41:28.800 --> 41:32.200
<i>I think he's been lying to me

41:32.200 --> 41:34.280
<i>He's been having an affair with her.</i>
