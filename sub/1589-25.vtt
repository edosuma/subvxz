WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:02.727
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.770 --> 00:05.364
Alison DiLaurentis planned
and carried out

00:05.400 --> 00:07.197
the murder
of Mona Vanderwaal.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.299
ARIA: Hanna
has been arrested.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.307
But we'll figure this out.

00:10.340 --> 00:11.762
No one is gonna believe us.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.778
Getting a little tired
of memorializing Mona.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.232
Are you saying
that the world's

00:15.280 --> 00:16.269
better off without her?

00:16.310 --> 00:17.379
I have done
a lot to get that.

00:17.410 --> 00:19.275
I did it to protect
the one person

00:19.320 --> 00:20.412
that matters most to me.

00:20.450 --> 00:22.088
You didn't kill anyone.
I know.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.212
ButI let a lot
of things happen

00:23.250 --> 00:24.239
that I shouldn't have.

00:24.290 --> 00:25.439
Have you reached a verdict?

00:25.490 --> 00:27.788
WOMAN: Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

00:27.820 --> 00:28.912
TANNER: There is nothing
you can do.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.679
It is too late to help her
or her friends.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.028
They chose to help
the wrong person.

00:37.330 --> 00:40.766
I didn't think I could feel
worse after "A" killed Mona.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.064
But the four of us getting
arrested for her murder

00:43.110 --> 00:45.237
brings low to a whole
new level.

00:45.270 --> 00:48.330
Technically, they think
that we're accessories,

00:48.380 --> 00:49.244
not killers.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.271
An accessory is a necklace
or a handbag,

00:51.310 --> 00:52.675
not a chain gang.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.812
HANNA:
Call it what you want.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.442
We're all going to jail.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.789
"A" wins.

00:57.820 --> 01:00.357
Why do you think
they're separating us from Ali?

01:00.390 --> 01:02.688
There's a lady
in the laundry.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.686
If you do her work,
she gives you information.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.119
Yesterday she told me
that the warden received

01:07.160 --> 01:08.559
an anonymous tip.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.761
They think the five of us
are plotting something big.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.439
What, and they think
Ali's the big bad wolf?

01:13.470 --> 01:15.392
But does that make us
the little pigs or Little Red?

01:15.440 --> 01:16.702
SPENCER:
Doesn't matter.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.332
A wolf can't lead
without her pack.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.576
When we get there,

01:19.610 --> 01:21.475
they're probably
going to split us up, too.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.619
What's it like, Han?

01:27.650 --> 01:29.811
Do you want me to sugarcoat it
or tell you the truth?

01:29.850 --> 01:32.216
Well, if I'm going
to get through it,

01:32.260 --> 01:34.114
I need to know
what to expect.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.458
The second
they slam that door shut,

01:36.490 --> 01:37.559
you feel ashamed.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.228
This is crazy.
We didn't do anything.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.352
HANNA:
They don't care about that.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.561
They treat you like
a criminal,

01:42.600 --> 01:44.591
and it's hard to remember
that you're not one.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.362
( sighs ) The first night's
the hardest.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.139
You're locked away
from everything

01:51.170 --> 01:52.876
and everyone
you ever cared about.

01:52.910 --> 01:55.799
And when they turn
those lights out,

01:55.840 --> 01:58.775
it is the loneliest feeling
you could ever imagine.

02:00.650 --> 02:03.517
Second thought, I could have
used a thick coat of sugar.

02:03.550 --> 02:07.316
You can't be ready
for how it feels, Em.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.328
It's hard not to give up
on hope.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.354
SPENCER:
You guys, they can take
everything from us,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.391
but they can't take us
from each other.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.624
I don't care how far apart
from you guys I am,

02:18.670 --> 02:20.297
I will still be
with you.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.398
Me, too.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.668
Same here.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.728
I love you, guys.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.429
Love you.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.614
(vehicle rattles )

02:33.650 --> 02:34.912
Ah!

02:34.950 --> 02:36.212
Ow!

02:38.820 --> 02:39.912
What the hell was that?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.484
We just had an accident.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.283
Yeah, I did in my pants.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.184
(thud )

02:46.530 --> 02:47.599
( man coughs )

02:48.660 --> 02:50.491
Oh, my God.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.395
Oh, my God.
Get back. Get back!

02:54.370 --> 02:56.258
( panting )

02:56.310 --> 02:57.436
( door unlocking )

02:59.680 --> 03:00.601
Oh, my God.

03:02.980 --> 03:05.278
( all gasps )

03:05.310 --> 03:06.538
( all screaming )

03:07.920 --> 03:08.944
Oh, my God.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.880
Oh, my God.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.956
( all whimpering )

03:18.030 --> 03:20.328
* Got a secret,
can you keep it?

03:20.360 --> 03:22.863
* Swear this one
you'll save *

03:22.900 --> 03:25.425
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:25.470 --> 03:27.893
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:27.940 --> 03:29.828
* If I show you,
then I know *

03:29.870 --> 03:32.907
* You won't tell what I said

03:32.940 --> 03:35.431
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:35.480 --> 03:37.869
* If one of them is dead

03:39.850 --> 03:41.772
We think the transport officers
were neutralized

03:41.820 --> 03:44.709
with an injection
of flunitrazepam.

03:44.750 --> 03:45.739
The date rape drug?

03:45.790 --> 03:48.588
The deputies regained
consciousness this morning

03:48.620 --> 03:50.827
with no memory
of the incident.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.953
The girls were wrongfully
accused to begin with.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.422
And now
they're all missing?

03:54.460 --> 03:56.496
Let's get our facts straight.

03:56.530 --> 03:57.758
The incident was an abduction.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.439
Yeah, but who would
want to take the girls?

04:00.470 --> 04:02.859
Should we be asking
who would or who could?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.662
( sighs )

04:04.710 --> 04:06.803
If Mona was alive...

04:06.840 --> 04:08.307
I keep thinking
this feels like that.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.500
No. No.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.643
There's only been one person
at the center of any trouble

04:11.680 --> 04:13.739
the girls have gotten into.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.316
You think
Alison's behind this?

04:15.350 --> 04:16.886
Alison'_s a master
manipulator,

04:16.920 --> 04:18.387
but she doesn't have access

04:18.420 --> 04:19.819
to what was needed
to pull off something

04:19.860 --> 04:20.849
this elaborate.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.482
Why these girls?

04:22.530 --> 04:24.327
What would make them
somebody's target?

04:26.660 --> 04:28.321
Well, the good news is
Tanner wants to keep this

04:28.360 --> 04:29.429
out of the press.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.667
No one knows about
this yet.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.930
Wait, not even
the other girls' parents?

04:34.970 --> 04:36.608
We have to keep
this between us.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.062
We don't want a civilian
mob out there being

04:38.110 --> 04:40.328
told to shoot first
and ask questions later.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.779
But if they think our daughters
are fugitives,

04:41.810 --> 04:43.641
isn't that what_ Tanner's
telling the police to do?

04:43.680 --> 04:44.772
You're damn straight it is.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.175
WOMAN: ( on radio )
All units in the vicinity

04:46.210 --> 04:48.417
of Whitewood and Stuckey,
possible domestic violence...

04:48.450 --> 04:49.815
Could you just give me
one second please?

04:54.420 --> 04:56.650
Now Alison may
still be locked up,

04:56.690 --> 04:58.055
but she has access
to people.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.721
We both know
what she's capable of.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.939
Mom?

05:48.980 --> 05:50.402
Mom!

06:14.570 --> 06:15.696
Hello?

06:15.740 --> 06:16.832
Can anybody hear me?

06:26.010 --> 06:27.443
Aria?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.744
Hanna, Spencer?

06:29.790 --> 06:30.916
Is anybody here?

06:34.790 --> 06:35.814
What the...

07:17.670 --> 07:22.198
WOMAN: ( on PA) Welcome.
Willkommen. Bienvenidos.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.935
( buzzing )

07:26.110 --> 07:27.634
Please exit your room

07:27.680 --> 07:29.500
and follow
the lighted pathway.

07:45.630 --> 07:46.756
Oh, my God.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.923
Is everybody okay?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.562
What is this place?

07:51.600 --> 07:52.965
I think
this is "A's" house.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.228
More like
"A's" dollhouse.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.066
Yeah, and we're the dolls.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.260
WOMAN: ( on PA)
Please follow

07:56.300 --> 07:57.938
the lighted pathway.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.603
Please follow
the lighted pathway.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.878
We heard you, bitch.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.778
( piano music playing )

08:56.330 --> 08:58.093
Ali, is that you?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.648
( gasps )

09:10.680 --> 09:11.840
Oh, my God!

09:28.830 --> 09:30.127
Mona?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.967
Mona?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.365
I know it's been a while,

09:33.400 --> 09:36.858
but I haven't changed
that much, have I?

09:43.410 --> 09:45.002
You guys, it's me...

09:47.720 --> 09:48.948
Alison.

09:54.690 --> 09:57.079
Caleb got into the PD's
command center.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.724
And if you cross-check
the van's GPS system

09:59.760 --> 10:02.627
with the PD's system,
it goes dead right here.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.729
On Route 30,
near the railroad crossing.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.828
That's when "A" hacked

10:05.870 --> 10:06.689
into the van's computer system

10:06.740 --> 10:08.696
and took remote control
of the vehicle.

10:08.740 --> 10:09.832
Okay, so "A" would have needed
to be near

10:09.870 --> 10:10.837
to keep the van on the road.

10:10.870 --> 10:13.077
The overpass would have given
"A" a clear view

10:13.110 --> 10:14.975
and also cover
from the deputies.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.875
Are there any traffic cameras
in the area

10:16.910 --> 10:18.047
that you can hack into?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.048
I am one step ahead of you.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.616
Backing up that footage now.

10:23.420 --> 10:25.786
One frame of "A,"
that's all we need.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.723
I can't believe
It's really you.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.422
There has to be
another way out.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.654
There is not.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.025
It's tea time.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.890
Tea time?

10:45.070 --> 10:46.230
What is this place?

10:46.270 --> 10:47.373
Do you know where we are?

10:49.180 --> 10:51.148
We're in my living room,
Spencen

10:51.180 --> 10:53.148
This is my house.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.045
Why are you acting
like such an imbecile?

10:56.220 --> 10:59.212
Han, it's not like
you're gonna gain it

10:59.250 --> 11:01.059
all back by eating
one cookie.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.955
You know you want one.

11:08.030 --> 11:09.918
We really thought
you were dead.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.890
Thank God for Mrs. Grunwald.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.999
I don't know
how I'll ever repay her

11:16.040 --> 11:17.860
for saving my life that night.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.305
I'm so happy
to see you guys.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.877
We're really happy
to see you too, Mona.

11:25.910 --> 11:28.310
Do not call me that again.

11:28.350 --> 11:30.341
You know how much
I loathe that bitch.

11:33.790 --> 11:34.859
( mouthing )

11:38.030 --> 11:40.897
So, Alison...

11:40.930 --> 11:42.227
More tea?

11:42.260 --> 11:45.263
( bell chimes )

12:15.260 --> 12:17.296
We need to start the game.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.469
What if we don't
want to play?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.139
Fo_ur chimes _means
It's game tIme.

12:31.010 --> 12:33.444
The object of the game
is to be ready for your date

12:33.480 --> 12:35.141
by acquiring an outfit.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.044
Then you get
to open the door

12:36.080 --> 12:38.116
and find out
who your mystery date is.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.157
Like this.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.454
Wait, that's from
the Ice Ball.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.996
No. I'm not going to sit here
and play this stupid game.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.162
( bell chimes )

13:03.350 --> 13:05.079
There's something
for everyone today.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.812
These are invitations to prom.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.487
I think we're playing
the game to see

13:16.520 --> 13:17.555
who our prom dates will be.

13:17.590 --> 13:18.989
No, I'm not.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.253
You win. Okay?

13:22.300 --> 13:24.427
You can have us
as your preCIous dolls.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.698
But if Caleb shows up here,

13:25.730 --> 13:28.392
if you do anything
to hurt him, I will kill you.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.395
Hanna!
No.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.067
You are not Alison.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.099
You're Mona, okay?

13:32.140 --> 13:33.937
And this is not your house.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.232
You're not here
alone anymore.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.907
There are five of us,

13:37.950 --> 13:40.976
and one of him,
her, it, bitch.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.317
Hanna's right.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.908
Let's find a way to get
the hell out of here.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.247
Mona, let's go.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.087
My name is Alison.
Alison DiLaurentis.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.314
Mona, let's go!

13:49.360 --> 13:51.385
( siren blaring )

13:51.430 --> 13:52.454
What is that?

13:52.490 --> 13:53.559
It's trying to warn you.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.022
Guys, I can't take it.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.220
Oh, my God.

13:59.470 --> 14:00.994
Mona! Hurry!

14:01.040 --> 14:01.961
Guys!

14:03.610 --> 14:06.101
It won't stop
until you're in your rooms!

14:06.140 --> 14:07.835
( siren continues blaring )

14:15.250 --> 14:16.945
( alarm stops )

14:20.960 --> 14:22.484
It should be coming up.

14:25.460 --> 14:26.484
You can't get to that overpass

14:26.530 --> 14:28.088
without passing
a camera, right?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.392
What the...

14:35.070 --> 14:37.106
"A" found a way
to override the camera.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.267
"A's" mocking us
with a damn cartoon.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.511
Are you okay?

14:49.550 --> 14:51.108
I'll go get you
some ice for that.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.357
I don't need ice.
I need to find Aria.

14:53.390 --> 14:55.210
And we've got nothing.
Nothing!

14:55.260 --> 14:56.215
IfI can find the right code,

14:56.260 --> 14:57.329
then maybe
I can write a program

14:57.360 --> 14:59.920
that'll pinpoint the source
of the hacker's signal.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.325
That's all we need
to prove to Tanner

15:01.360 --> 15:03.419
that "A" took control
of the van.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.258
( door opens )

15:25.620 --> 15:27.588
We've got 3 minutes.
Come on.

15:32.730 --> 15:35.198
Every night the main generator
shuts down like clockwork.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.492
It takes exactly 3 minutes

15:36.530 --> 15:38.191
for the back-up power
to kick in.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.029
I have run for 90 seconds
in each direction.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.367
That's the way out,
but there's an old silo

15:44.410 --> 15:45.729
at the end,
and you have to climb up.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.032
There is a ladder,

15:47.080 --> 15:48.104
but it's about
50 feet to the top.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.698
And you can't get there
before the power turns on

15:49.740 --> 15:51.048
and all the doors lock again.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.570
That leads to a big,
empty room.

15:52.610 --> 15:54.510
There's nothing there.
It's not a way out.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.518
But if you go past it,
there's a steel door

15:56.550 --> 15:59.189
at the end of the hall
and it's sealed like a vault.

15:59.220 --> 16:01.188
Like a bank vault?
What's inside?

16:01.220 --> 16:02.414
I'm dying to know,
too, Spencer.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.257
But I've never
made it inside.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.689
It's too far to make it
back to your room.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.526
What happens if you don't
make it back in time?

16:09.560 --> 16:13.132
It leaves you for days
without food or water.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.297
It blasts the siren
until you'd rather die

16:15.340 --> 16:17.205
than listen to it
one more second.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.608
On a loop it plays
a recording of the people

16:22.640 --> 16:25.438
that you've left behind,
crying at your funeral.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.169
Is my mom okay?

16:31.720 --> 16:33.483
You know you're Mona.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.613
It wanted me
to become Alison.

16:35.660 --> 16:38.254
So that's who I am
when it's watching.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.359
It thinks it beat me.

16:39.390 --> 16:40.527
But I'm still here.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.596
I'm the one
who's WInnIng the game.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.066
Is she okay?

16:48.100 --> 16:49.169
My mom?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.601
I saw her a lot
in the beginning.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.074
But there was a trial.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.146
They convicted All
for your murder.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.641
And they arrested us
as accessories.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.216
I didn't think
you were wearIng

17:04.250 --> 17:05.581
that to make
a fashion statement.

17:06.820 --> 17:08.356
Yep, she's Mona.

17:08.390 --> 17:10.358
Your mom never showed up
to the courthouse.

17:10.390 --> 17:13.097
We heard that it was
all too much for her.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.692
God, Mona, I'm so happy
that you're okay.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.197
( clicking )

17:20.240 --> 17:21.696
Did you hear that?

17:21.740 --> 17:23.230
Hear what?

17:24.510 --> 17:25.761
We've got 17 seconds.
Run!

17:48.600 --> 17:49.749
Is Spencer okay?

17:49.800 --> 17:52.689
You can drop
the whole caring friend act.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.698
We know exactly
who and what you are.

17:55.870 --> 17:59.306
I've done some bad things,
Mr. Hastings,

17:59.340 --> 18:01.228
but like it or not,
I am Spencer's friend.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.805
You forced our daughter
to lie for you.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.772
Now she's in as much
trouble as you are.

18:05.810 --> 18:07.710
I was desperate.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.308
MRS. HASTINGS:
And so are we.

18:09.350 --> 18:11.215
Do you know where she is?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.688
Spencer?

18:14.720 --> 18:16.119
No.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.289
Don't you?

18:19.330 --> 18:23.391
Alison, I promise you
that guard outside

18:23.430 --> 18:26.524
will not be able to save you
if you lie to us tonight.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.535
What happened?

18:32.570 --> 18:36.176
Their van never made it
to the penItentIary.

18:36.210 --> 18:37.871
The police think
that they escaped.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.605
But we know
that's not true.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.615
I don't know
where they are.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.685
But I do know
who took them.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.779
We're listening.

18:55.530 --> 18:56.599
It's "A."

19:00.440 --> 19:01.566
Any chance of "A" hurting

19:01.600 --> 19:04.637
those girls again
died with Mona.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.399
Mona was "A."

19:06.440 --> 19:08.271
That's true.

19:08.310 --> 19:09.732
But it all started again

19:09.780 --> 19:12.601
when she was locked up
in Radley.

19:12.650 --> 19:15.949
It was the same game,
but with a new puppet master.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.619
And the stakes were
higher than ever.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.723
This "A" killed
my mom and Mona.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.250
MR. HASTINGS:
Oh, come on.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.382
If you really believe that,

19:26.430 --> 19:27.556
then why didn't you
go to the police?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.955
Hanna tried,

19:30.000 --> 19:31.865
but there wasn't any proof.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.265
There never is.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.665
Why would it start
all over again?

19:34.700 --> 19:36.395
It doesn't make any sense.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.862
Mona was sick.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.333
We know that that's why
she wanted to hurt the girls.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.803
I'm telling you the truth.

19:42.840 --> 19:43.909
I swear it.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.373
Why be honest now?

19:46.410 --> 19:50.710
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life in here.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.581
I don't have
anything else to lose.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.552
But you do.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.680
It has a name.

21:38.860 --> 21:39.929
For me?

21:39.960 --> 21:41.655
( bell chimes )

22:04.620 --> 22:06.588
Would you like me
to put it on?

22:06.620 --> 22:08.383
( bell chimes )

22:36.450 --> 22:37.917
It's all there
in black and white.

22:37.950 --> 22:39.508
Somebody cyber-jacked
the van

22:39.550 --> 22:41.108
and kidnapped the girls.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.082
You put a lot of work
into this theory.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.759
It's not a theory,
it's the facts.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.792
Yes, I know.

22:47.830 --> 22:48.649
Our analyst gave me

22:48.700 --> 22:50.827
a very similar report
this morning.

22:50.870 --> 22:51.996
Take a look.

22:53.740 --> 22:54.866
MAN: ( on phone )
Dispatch.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.630
Put out an APB
for Caleb Rivers.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.001
Yes, ma'am.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.701
What?

23:02.540 --> 23:04.440
You don't happen to know
where he is,

23:04.480 --> 23:06.402
do you,
Officer Cavanaugh?

23:07.680 --> 23:08.749
No. I--

23:08.780 --> 23:09.678
I haven't seen him
for days,

23:09.720 --> 23:11.813
but what does Caleb
have to do with this?

23:11.850 --> 23:14.614
These reports do prove
that someone

23:14.660 --> 23:16.685
cyber-jacked that vehicle.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.019
And I'm betting
that it is Caleb Rivers.

23:20.060 --> 23:22.528
I think he knows
where his girlfriend is.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.626
You guys, the blocks
in the playroom

23:26.670 --> 23:28.865
spelled out a name.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.959
Charles.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.433
WOMAN: ( on PA)
Please find your stations.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.645
"Aria Montgomery,
music committee."

23:44.050 --> 23:45.847
"Emily Fields
and Spencer Hastings,

23:45.890 --> 23:47.517
decorating committee."

23:49.960 --> 23:52.178
"Hanna Marin,
food and beverage."

23:52.230 --> 23:53.458
Bite me.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.688
"Alison DiLaurentis,
prom queen election committee."

23:58.900 --> 24:01.869
All these songs are
from like 7 years ago.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.037
A Night At The Opera.

24:03.070 --> 24:04.799
That was the prom theme
the last year

24:04.840 --> 24:06.865
that Melissa took Ian.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.902
So "A's" recreating a prom
we already had?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.075
Well, if I'm on the
election committee,

24:13.110 --> 24:15.214
you can be sure
I'll win that crown.

24:15.250 --> 24:18.947
Sort of like old times,
huh, Spencer?

24:18.990 --> 24:20.582
Remember when I rigged
the election for you

24:20.620 --> 24:21.587
to win class president?

24:23.060 --> 24:25.528
Want to fill
some of these out?

24:25.560 --> 24:27.528
I'll help you
if you help me.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.029
Sure.

24:32.070 --> 24:32.820
If "A" doesn't mind,

24:32.870 --> 24:34.633
maybe we can
all help each other,

24:34.670 --> 24:36.467
starting with these ballots.

24:58.730 --> 24:59.879
( knocking on door)

25:08.000 --> 25:09.638
We know about "A."

25:21.950 --> 25:23.747
Are you okay?

25:23.790 --> 25:25.746
So this is going to be
our senior prom?

25:25.790 --> 25:28.088
We're decorating with
construction paper and tape?

25:28.120 --> 25:30.259
Maybe that's part
of our punishment,

25:30.290 --> 25:33.020
to put together
the lamest prom ever.

25:33.060 --> 25:36.029
You know, this space is
actually pretty awesome.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.028
I'm surprised "A" doesn't
have the imagination

25:38.070 --> 25:39.128
to see it.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.798
It's a big, ugly room.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.536
Okay, but what if...

25:45.740 --> 25:48.208
What if we use
the staircase

25:48.240 --> 25:50.743
to make a grand entrance
for All to walk down?

25:50.780 --> 25:54.216
We think Gloria Swanson
in Sunset Boulevard.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.775
All right, we could rig a bunch
of cameras to go off

25:56.820 --> 25:59.118
on a timer as you
walk down those steps.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.789
It'd be so easy to take
all these copper pipes

26:01.820 --> 26:03.651
and use them
for drapery rods.

26:03.690 --> 26:07.956
And we could use old pipes
and make beautiful candelabras.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.924
And we could hang wire
from the ceiling

26:10.970 --> 26:14.064
and hang shapes to create
some beautiful shadows

26:14.100 --> 26:15.169
and silhouettes.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.763
That would be
A Night At The Opera.

26:21.140 --> 26:22.676
We need to tell
the other gIrls' parents

26:22.710 --> 26:23.802
what we know.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.648
Agreed, but we were hoping
to have some more answers

26:26.680 --> 26:27.817
before we do that.

26:27.850 --> 26:28.874
I don't understand
why you can't take

26:28.920 --> 26:30.239
this information
to the po|Ice.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.816
Everything we give Tanner

26:31.850 --> 26:33.784
she twists
to fit her own theory.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.959
Then let's take
our case to the media.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.821
I can call Angela King
at the Philadelphia Press.

26:37.860 --> 26:38.758
She owes me a favor.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.826
Mr. Hastings,
with what we know about "A,"

26:40.860 --> 26:42.293
that is just not
the right move.

26:42.330 --> 26:43.888
What do you know about "A?"

26:43.930 --> 26:45.295
Everything's in those boxes.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.890
And_about a dozen _more
In a storage unIt

26:47.940 --> 26:49.737
up on the North Highway.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.658
How did we not see
this happening again?

26:51.710 --> 26:53.359
Forcing the girls to keep
things from you

26:53.410 --> 26:54.809
is what "A" does best.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.829
All right.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.371
Well, maybe if we look
at all this together...

26:59.810 --> 27:01.971
we might find something
that you guys missed.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.011
But before you do that...

27:08.920 --> 27:10.649
Your secrets
are In there, too.

27:10.690 --> 27:12.123
And if you decide
to open them,

27:12.160 --> 27:14.253
you need to be prepared
for those to come out.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.099
No more secrets.

27:23.270 --> 27:25.135
( cell phone rings )

27:28.080 --> 27:29.069
The police are
downstairs.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.704
And they want
to come up.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.876
They're here for me.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.049
And you're harboring
a fugitive.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.116
You can't be here
when they find him.

27:39.050 --> 27:41.280
Don't stop looking.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.355
Caleb, wait--

27:42.390 --> 27:44.119
Toby...

27:44.160 --> 27:45.889
He's doing the right thing.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.057
And we need you
on the right side of this,

27:48.100 --> 27:49.192
and your boss.

27:52.330 --> 27:54.036
( cell phone rings )

27:57.470 --> 27:58.937
It's Melissa.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.038
Melissa...

28:03.510 --> 28:05.307
there's something
you need to know.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.315
So "A's" a guy?

28:08.350 --> 28:09.840
I don't know
any girls named Charles.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.347
Why would "A"
give you a gas mask?

28:11.390 --> 28:12.948
Ali's his favorite.

28:12.990 --> 28:14.150
I think after the prom,

28:14.190 --> 28:15.782
she's the only one
he wants to keep.

28:15.820 --> 28:16.809
So our Night At The Opera

28:16.860 --> 28:18.282
is going to turn
into a scene from Carrie?

28:18.330 --> 28:20.719
No, we're not going
to let that happen.

28:20.760 --> 28:21.749
MONA:
I know what
you're thinking, Spencer,

28:21.800 --> 28:22.926
but I promise
you don't have time

28:22.960 --> 28:24.120
to make it to that vault.

28:24.170 --> 28:28.061
So have you ever built one?

28:28.100 --> 28:30.830
I haven't needed
to build one.

28:30.870 --> 28:31.837
But I've read about it.

28:31.870 --> 28:32.837
Build what?

28:32.870 --> 28:34.428
The stuff Spencer said
she needed to decorate.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.378
If it delivers,

28:35.410 --> 28:36.331
we'll have what we need
to build a machine

28:36.380 --> 28:38.940
that temporarily
shuts off the electricity.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.277
How long is temporarily?

28:40.310 --> 28:42.369
Long enough
to get us out of here.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.342
Yeah, we can turn off the power,
but what about "A?"

28:44.390 --> 28:45.482
And it's his prom.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.987
There's no way
he's not coming.

28:47.020 --> 28:48.487
I hope you're right, Emily.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.748
Because like Hanna said,

28:49.790 --> 28:52.429
there's five of us
and one of him.

28:58.530 --> 29:02.239
WOMAN: ( on PA) Good morning.
Guten tag. Bom dia.

29:02.270 --> 29:03.828
Please find your stations.

29:03.870 --> 29:05.167
Oh, wow.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.838
This is not
what I was expecting.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.302
So now you're excited?

29:09.340 --> 29:10.500
You're actually
going to help "A"

29:10.540 --> 29:13.077
decorate this place?

29:13.110 --> 29:14.145
We can use this
to make a curtaIn

29:14.180 --> 29:15.511
for Ali's grand entrance.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.046
Well, you're on your own.

29:19.420 --> 29:21.911
Em, we're all in this together.
What are you doing?

29:21.960 --> 29:23.086
Taking a stand.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.485
By sitting?

29:24.530 --> 29:26.828
This isn't my prom.
I'm not helping.

29:26.860 --> 29:28.293
Why are you being
such a bitch?

29:28.330 --> 29:31.060
I'm being a bitch?
Take a look around.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.489
Why are you making
this so easy for "A"?

29:33.530 --> 29:35.395
Oh, my God, drapes!
Thanks, "A."

29:35.440 --> 29:37.260
I'm so excited,
I get to have my senior prom

29:37.300 --> 29:38.335
in a dungeon.

29:38.370 --> 29:39.860
You know what?
Forget it, Emily.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.332
I don't need your help.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.371
You did that on purpose.

29:43.410 --> 29:44.809
SPENCER: Get over yourself.
ARIA: Stop,

29:44.850 --> 29:45.976
this is already
stressful enough as it is.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.147
Spencer, don't start--

29:47.180 --> 29:49.273
I didn't start anything.
The quitter did.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.912
That's what you do,
isn't it, Emily?

29:50.950 --> 29:51.985
You quit things.

29:52.020 --> 29:52.987
When things are
too much for you,

29:53.020 --> 29:54.214
you just throw
in the towel.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.852
I mean, you quit
the swim team.

29:55.890 --> 29:57.380
You quit Paige.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.149
You even quit Maya.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.564
ARIA: Guys!

30:05.600 --> 30:07.227
You, guys!

30:07.270 --> 30:08.294
Ow!

30:08.340 --> 30:09.534
You guys!

30:09.570 --> 30:10.901
Stop it!

30:10.940 --> 30:12.567
Emily --

30:12.610 --> 30:14.475
Stop.
Get her off!

30:14.510 --> 30:16.535
Stop. Stop! Stop.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.309
You guys, honestly,
I cannot handle this.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.977
Please, can we not do this
to each other?

30:23.950 --> 30:25.838
I'm sorry, Spence.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.915
Okay, I know
this isn't your fault.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.313
Me, too.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.315
Look, I'm just
trying to make the best

30:30.360 --> 30:32.328
of a very bad situation.

30:32.360 --> 30:33.554
If you baboons
are done fighting,

30:33.590 --> 30:35.023
I could
use some help over here.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.823
Then we can
all decorate together.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.352
If I knew where they were,
I wouldn't be here right now.

31:01.390 --> 31:03.210
I would be with Hanna.

31:05.390 --> 31:08.553
But you don't and you won't.
So let's quit wasting time.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.319
You need to charge
our client or release him.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.094
You might not know exactly
where they are,

31:16.140 --> 31:18.267
but you know more than
what you're telling me.

31:19.540 --> 31:22.668
You're right.
I know a lot more than you do.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.405
Okay, son,
I think it's time we go.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.644
_ I hacked
Into your computer system,

31:25.680 --> 31:27.978
and I found the location
where you lost the van.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.079
You just admitted
to a federal offense.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.587
I think he meant to say
if he hacked

31:31.620 --> 31:33.542
into your system he could
find the van.

31:33.590 --> 31:36.411
And if he had further access
to that system,

31:36.460 --> 31:37.586
he may be able to...

31:37.620 --> 31:39.349
Override
the hacker's jamming signal

31:39.390 --> 31:40.459
and locate the van.

31:40.490 --> 31:42.924
Those are some big "ifs."

31:42.960 --> 31:45.360
I think the bigger "ifs" are
what if you're wrong?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.265
What if someone
did take the girls?

31:47.300 --> 31:49.188
And because
you haven't considered it,

31:49.240 --> 31:50.229
you and your analysts
are looking

31:50.270 --> 31:51.237
in all the wrong places.

31:51.270 --> 31:53.602
Haven't you asked yourself
how four teenagers

31:53.640 --> 31:55.904
could be this good
at evading the police?

31:57.310 --> 31:58.641
You're not going to ﬁnd
the answer

31:58.680 --> 32:00.409
investigating the girls

32:00.450 --> 32:02.372
because they're not
running from you.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.084
There's no way that Hanna
wouldn't call me if she could.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.625
So is everything
all set?

32:17.660 --> 32:18.695
Yeah.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.527
We're about as ready
as we can be.

32:20.570 --> 32:21.969
Aria,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.331
since
you're the photographer,

32:23.370 --> 32:24.667
you should take
the pictures.

32:26.270 --> 32:27.532
You know
how to work that, right?

32:27.570 --> 32:30.175
Yeah. It's just
point and shoot, isn't it?

32:30.210 --> 32:32.098
Yeah, just save it
for tonight though,

32:32.150 --> 32:33.299
'cause_there's
only one ﬁrst pIcture.

32:33.350 --> 32:34.317
You know what I mean?

32:34.350 --> 32:35.476
Got it.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.340
WOMAN: ( on PA)
Good afternoon.

32:37.380 --> 32:40.281
Guten tag. Boa tarde.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.515
Please follow
the lighted pathway

32:43.560 --> 32:45.221
and return to your rooms.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.428
We got this.

32:53.730 --> 32:55.266
Sometimes a hacker
leaves a traII

32:55.300 --> 32:57.530
intentionally coded
to cover their tracks.

32:57.570 --> 33:00.038
It's smoke and mirrors
put there to dIstract you

33:00.070 --> 33:01.173
while they're actually...

33:03.480 --> 33:05.243
Oh, wow.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.248
TOBY: Did you find
something?

33:07.280 --> 33:08.474
Rivers?

33:11.250 --> 33:12.342
Caleb?

33:16.290 --> 33:18.121
The thing about coming in
through the back door

33:18.160 --> 33:20.082
_ is_ the view
Is entIrely dIfferent.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.428
40.0508 North,

33:22.460 --> 33:25.463
75.4044 West.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.524
Those are coordinates.

33:26.570 --> 33:28.197
That's where the van is.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.593
Are you sure
about this?

33:31.340 --> 33:34.207
Like I said,
that's where the van is.

33:36.510 --> 33:37.772
Call it in, Cavanaugh.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.278
Hold the sirens,
but have aerial assistance

33:40.310 --> 33:41.345
standing by.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.268
Yes, ma'am.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.413
We got a possible location
on the missing van.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.021
"A" thought of everything.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.367
( doors slam )

34:06.370 --> 34:08.076
Clear!

34:08.110 --> 34:11.238
Fan out and search
the perImeter.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.147
And remember, this could be
a hostage situation.

34:14.180 --> 34:15.340
So abide protocol.

34:17.350 --> 34:19.739
( music playing )

34:25.460 --> 34:27.428
Am I the only one
who has goosebumps?

34:27.460 --> 34:29.189
ALL: No.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.495
Where is Mona?

34:31.530 --> 34:33.589
I don't think she's here yet.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.301
I guess that means
we're supposed to dance.

34:40.340 --> 34:45.107
* I'm just beginning,
the pen's in my hand *

34:45.150 --> 34:47.243
* Ending unplanned

34:48.550 --> 34:51.849
* Staring at the blank
page before you *

34:51.890 --> 34:54.313
* Open up the dirty window

34:54.360 --> 34:56.612
* Let the sun illuminate
the words *

34:56.660 --> 34:57.809
* That you could not find

34:57.860 --> 35:01.455
* Reaching for something
in the distance *

35:01.500 --> 35:03.798
* So close _
you can almost taste It *

35:03.830 --> 35:06.219
* Release your inhibitions

35:06.270 --> 35:08.636
* Feel the _rain
on your skIn *

35:08.670 --> 35:10.695
* No one else
can feel It for you *

35:10.740 --> 35:13.163
* Only you can
let it in *

35:13.210 --> 35:15.371
* No one else,
no one else *

35:15.410 --> 35:17.799
* Can speak the words
on your lips *

35:17.840 --> 35:20.308
* Drench yourself
in words unspoken *

35:20.350 --> 35:22.773
* Live your life
with arms wide open *

35:22.820 --> 35:25.618
* Today is
where your book begins *

35:25.650 --> 35:27.709
’f‘ The rest is
stI|| unertten *

35:33.290 --> 35:37.454
* -- dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance *

35:37.500 --> 35:39.320
* Dance, dance

35:39.370 --> 35:41.292
* Oh oh oh

35:44.940 --> 35:46.760
WOMAN: ( on PA)
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:46.810 --> 35:48.471
please welcome
your prom queen...

35:50.580 --> 35:52.548
Alison DiLaurentis!

35:52.580 --> 35:54.377
( cheering )

36:07.260 --> 36:08.295
Charles...

36:09.830 --> 36:10.797
we have something for you.

36:14.970 --> 36:17.336
You should be
standing up here, Charles.

36:17.370 --> 36:19.201
It's what you want,
isn't it?

36:20.370 --> 36:21.974
This is your prom, Charles.

36:22.010 --> 36:23.807
You should be
crowned the king.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.373
Wait for it.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.201
Now!

37:02.880 --> 37:04.381
Let's go.

37:04.420 --> 37:05.717
Let's get the hell
out of here.
Let's go.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.308
Hurry.
Let's go.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.783
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Go, go!

37:32.510 --> 37:34.614
This is
the old Campbell Farm.

37:34.650 --> 37:37.312
We used to bring the girls here
to go apple picking.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.259
Lieutenant, over here.

37:47.930 --> 37:49.249
What did you find?

38:09.620 --> 38:10.712
What is this place?

38:14.090 --> 38:15.785
It's "A's" lair.

38:20.430 --> 38:21.419
WOMAN: Hurry up!

38:21.460 --> 38:22.825
Hurry up, darling.

38:22.860 --> 38:23.929
Oh, my God.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.565
( footsteps )

38:33.970 --> 38:38.703
* I go out walking
after midnight *

38:38.750 --> 38:44.416
* Out in the moonlight,
just like we used to do *

38:44.450 --> 38:48.887
* I'm always walking
after midnight *

38:48.920 --> 38:49.989
* Searching...

39:05.970 --> 39:07.835
SPENCER:
If this is your vault,

39:07.870 --> 39:10.338
then these are the things
you treasure the most.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.477
You want to say
good night to your sister

39:16.520 --> 39:17.976
and give her a little kiss?

39:18.020 --> 39:20.716
What a good boy you are.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.718
Oh, good boys,
good boys.

39:38.970 --> 39:40.403
Is that you, Charles?

39:47.710 --> 39:49.109
MONA: Spencer?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.880
This is not at all
what I thought it would be.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.819
"A" has a soul.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.462
WOMAN: Spencer!

40:06.500 --> 40:07.524
Spencer, where are you?

40:18.880 --> 40:19.847
MONA: Hanna! No!

40:19.880 --> 40:21.848
You are not Alison.
You're Mona.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.440
And this is not
your house, okay?

40:24.490 --> 40:26.082
You're not here
alone anymore.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.917
There are five of us

40:27.950 --> 40:30.680
and one of him,
her, it, bitch.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.427
My God.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.997
We've_ searched
the entIre property.

40:37.030 --> 40:38.099
There's no one here.

40:38.130 --> 40:39.392
Then where is
thIs place?

40:39.430 --> 40:41.466
EMILY: Let's ﬁnd a way
to get the hell out of here.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.092
HANNA:
Mona, come on.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.529
MONA: I'm Alison.
Alison DiLaurentis.

40:45.570 --> 40:47.208
For God's sakes,
Mona, let's go!

40:47.240 --> 40:48.537
( siren blaring )

40:48.580 --> 40:49.638
( girls scream )

40:49.680 --> 40:50.772
ARIA: What is that?

40:50.810 --> 40:51.845
MONA: Hurry.

41:01.050 --> 41:02.153
Oh, my God.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.224
We're still trapped.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.887
We can climb it.
Let's go.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.555
Stop!

41:15.840 --> 41:17.762
( music playing )

41:21.240 --> 41:23.276
* Oh, give me land

41:23.310 --> 41:26.609
* Lots of_ land
under starry skIes above *

41:26.650 --> 41:28.948
* Don't fence me in

41:28.980 --> 41:30.208
* Let me ride

41:30.250 --> 41:33.014
* Through the wide
open country that I love *

41:33.050 --> 41:36.110
* But don't fence me in

41:36.160 --> 41:39.982
* Let me be by myself
in the evening breeze *

41:40.030 --> 41:43.750
* And listen to the murmur
of the cottonwood trees *

41:43.800 --> 41:46.189
* Send me off forever,
but I ask you *

41:46.230 --> 41:50.997
* Please don't fence me in,
just turn me loose *

41:51.040 --> 41:53.031
* Let me straddle
my old saddle *

41:53.070 --> 41:56.130
* Underneath
the western skIes *

41:56.180 --> 41:59.900
* On my cayuse
let me wander over yonder *

41:59.950 --> 42:03.010
* Till I_see_
the mountaIns rIse *

42:03.050 --> 42:07.885
* I want to ride to the ridge
where the West commences *

42:07.920 --> 42:11.629
* And gaze at the moon
till I lose my senses *

42:11.660 --> 42:15.118
* And I can't look at hobbies
and I can't stand fences *

42:15.160 --> 42:17.048
* Don't fence me in...
