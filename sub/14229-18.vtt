Excuse me.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.210
Oh, apologies.

01:12.210 --> 01:14.620
The crown princess is in
a bit of a hurry this evening.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.000
A very important guest
has arrived.

01:22.460 --> 01:23.830
Help.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.880
- Naomi!
- Elena.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.580
-Oof!
- Sorry, Gabe.

01:27.580 --> 01:28.880
This is going to be
the best week.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.880
Wait till you see
your room.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.960
I never slept in
a palace before.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.460
That's not true.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.000
You slept right through
Esteban's speech last week

01:37.000 --> 01:38.620
at the grand council meeting.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.460
I hope you didn't put her
in the room next to yours.

01:43.460 --> 01:46.290
No, we're putting her
out by the guard barracks.

01:46.290 --> 01:47.790
Wait, what?

01:47.790 --> 01:49.790
Just kidding.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.960
I knew that.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.080
Allow me to introduce
Countess Delores,

01:55.080 --> 01:57.460
and her sister,
Lady Yolanda.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.750
ELENA:
Look who's here.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.460
Hey, Naomi.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.120
I didn't know Esteban
invited you to his dinner party.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.750
I didn't.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.540
Unbelievable.

02:08.540 --> 02:12.460
Esteban, we told you
Naomi was staying with us

02:12.460 --> 02:14.500
for the week while
her parents are away.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.790
I thought
you were joking.

02:15.790 --> 02:18.500
Don't worry.
I don't sleepwalk anymore.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.500
But apparently,
I snore.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.120
Hiya. I'm Naomi.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.460
Good e-e-e-evening.

02:24.460 --> 02:27.460
I was passed over
for the grand council

02:27.460 --> 02:29.540
while this child
was granted a seat

02:29.540 --> 02:32.290
at the age of...
how old are you again?

02:32.290 --> 02:34.380
- Fifteen.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.670
Fifteen?!

02:35.670 --> 02:37.460
But I'll be 16
this Saturday.

02:37.460 --> 02:39.790
Dinner is served.

02:39.790 --> 02:42.000
Naomi, your birthday's
this Saturday?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.790
Uh-huh.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.000
And your parents
won't be here for it?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.580
No, but birthdays aren't
a big deal in my family.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.420
I've spent most of
my birthdays at sea,

02:50.420 --> 02:52.670
so it's not like we could
have parties or anything.

02:52.670 --> 02:56.250
Not even a quinceañera
on your 15th birthday?

02:56.250 --> 02:57.790
As if you
had to ask.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.290
I love
that Avaloran tradition.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.670
It's too bad
I'm not Avaloran.

03:03.670 --> 03:05.120
Maybe you weren't
born here,

03:05.120 --> 03:07.210
but you are
Avaloran at heart.

03:07.210 --> 03:10.580
And I say we throw you
a quinceañera right here
in the castle.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.040
But you can't do that.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.210
- She's turning 16.
- Exactly.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.790
Then it'll be
a quinceañera plus one.

03:19.790 --> 03:21.960
What a lovely idea.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.880
I still remember
my quinceañera like
it was yesterday.

03:25.880 --> 03:29.710
Well, if yesterday was
many, many years ago.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.120
Mí amor.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.170
- As I was saying.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.830
It was so wonderful
being surrounded by
everyone I loved.

03:37.830 --> 03:40.880
May I remind you that
throwing a royal quinceañera

03:40.880 --> 03:42.460
is no simple task.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.120
It takes weeks,
maybe months,

03:45.120 --> 03:48.750
of intense planning
and royal expertise.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.000
You're right, Esteban.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.580
I am happy to see
you have come to your senses.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.290
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna need your help.

03:55.290 --> 03:57.120
!
- You are the expert

03:57.120 --> 04:00.500
- in all things royal,
aren't you?
- This is true.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.830
But not even our dear
chancellor Esteban

04:02.830 --> 04:05.040
could prepare someone
like Miss Turner

04:05.040 --> 04:06.790
for a royal quinceañera.

04:06.790 --> 04:08.290
Is that a challenge?

04:08.290 --> 04:10.330
No. It's a fact.

04:10.330 --> 04:13.500
On second thought,
I will happily assist you

04:13.500 --> 04:16.380
in planning Miss Turner's
royal quinceañera.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.960
Thank you, cousin.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.710
Yeah, thanks, Esteban.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.920
And you and I will begin
first thing in the morning,

04:21.920 --> 04:24.290
- Miss Turner.

04:24.290 --> 04:26.670
Your royal training,
of course.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.790
Planning a quinceañera
is difficult enough.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.330
Trying to get you prepared...

04:31.330 --> 04:35.120
well, that, my dear, will be
a monumental task.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.670
You do realize that when
she makes a fool of herself

04:37.670 --> 04:39.290
- at the party...
- NAOMI: Hey!

04:39.290 --> 04:41.540
...you will look
just as foolish.

04:41.540 --> 04:44.460
No one will look foolish,
because Naomi is
going to have

04:44.460 --> 04:47.500
the most fabulous
quinceañera the kingdom
has ever seen.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.540
I guess the whole kingdom
will be the judge of that,

04:52.290 --> 04:54.460
ESTEBAN: Duke Tomás,
Lady Maria.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.960
Duke Rebecca, Lady Duchess.
Got it!

04:57.960 --> 04:59.330
Oh, is that
the invite list?

04:59.330 --> 05:01.290
No, no.
They are the members

05:01.290 --> 05:04.170
of Naomi's
royal quinceañera court.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.290
- The birthday girl

05:06.290 --> 05:09.080
picks seven boys
and seven girls
to be on her court.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.710
They'll stand by you
at the quinceañera,

05:10.710 --> 05:12.580
and dance your first
waltz with you.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.710
Uh, I don't know
anybody on this list.

05:15.710 --> 05:18.420
Of course you don't.
They are royals.

05:18.420 --> 05:20.250
But I don't want a bunch
of strangers on my court.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.040
I just want my friends.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.380
Miss Turner, you are having
a royal quinceañera.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.120
You need royals
on your court.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.540
That is
the tradition.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.460
One of them will be
the crown princess.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.960
That's gotta count
for something.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.960
Mm

05:35.960 --> 05:39.000
Mateo, Gabe,
that's it.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.830
What?!
They are not royal,

05:40.830 --> 05:43.040
and you need
11 more.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.880
The whole point of the party
is to celebrate with my friends.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.000
They're the only ones
I want by my side.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.790
I think we can bend
tradition just this once.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.380
Yeah, can't we,
chancellor?

05:52.380 --> 05:53.790
Ay-yi-yi.

05:53.790 --> 05:55.790
With a court
that small,

05:55.790 --> 05:57.960
it means all eyes
will be on you,
Miss Turner.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.040
So I will
only agree to it

06:00.040 --> 06:02.790
if you promise to do
everything else I say.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.540
I promise.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.460
Higgins, have you made
all the preparations?

06:07.460 --> 06:10.790
Operation Rags to Royal
is a go, chancellor.

06:10.790 --> 06:12.000
Rags?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.380
Then let us begin!

06:15.380 --> 06:18.880
Making a flawless
grand entrance at
a royal quinceañera

06:18.880 --> 06:20.540
is key.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.500
It sets the tone
for the entire evening.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.830
Watch and learn.

06:24.830 --> 06:27.500
We are gliding,
we are gliding.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.620
Scan the room,
make eye contact,

06:31.620 --> 06:33.120
smile and wave.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.040
Smile and wave.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.790
Why, hello, duchess.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.500
So good to see you.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.330
My, you look radiant
tonight, chancellor.

06:41.330 --> 06:44.000
As do you, duchess.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.880
Now it's your turn.
Come, come.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.790
Glide away.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.540
Ay, no, no, no.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.830
That is not gliding.
That is stomping.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.500
Now try the smile and wave.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.290
Hiya, Pete.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.120
Glad you could
make it, Scotty.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.880
Love the new
eye patch, Ricardo.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.290
- Ay-yi-yi.
- Maybe we should start
with something easier.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.750
Easier than walking?

07:05.750 --> 07:08.000
To properly
greet guests

07:08.000 --> 07:09.580
at your royal
quinceañera,

07:09.580 --> 07:11.710
you must enunciate,

07:11.710 --> 07:13.750
and do away with
that horrible rasp.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.500
What horrible rasp?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.830
Ay! There it is again.

07:16.830 --> 07:19.920
Repeat after me.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.290
I am delighted
you were invited.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.920
Extremely excited
to be reunited.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.830
Who talks like that?

07:27.830 --> 07:29.540
Yeah, can't I just say
"Thanks for coming"?

07:29.540 --> 07:32.250
Oh, it is like
nails on a chalkboard.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.380
Okay, okay.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.460
I am delighted
you got invited.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.670
Pretty excited...

07:39.670 --> 07:41.420
To be reunited.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.620
That you've been knighted?

07:43.620 --> 07:46.170
Listen carefully.

07:46.170 --> 07:49.000
I am delighted
you were invited.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.460
Extremely excited
to be reunited.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.120
I'm delighted
you were invited.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.040
Extremely excited
to be reunited.
Yes! I did it.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.210
Yes, you did.
Poorly!

08:01.210 --> 08:03.040
Ah, this is
impossible.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.710
Who knew walking
and talking were so hard?

08:07.710 --> 08:09.040
I'll be right back.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.500
Esteban, wait.
Naomi's trying her best.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.670
All this formal stuff
is new to her.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.750
Elena, she is
beyond help.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.420
Don't you think you're
being too hard on her?

08:20.420 --> 08:23.210
Quinceañera should be fun,
not stressful.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.420
I want her to remember
this day forever.

08:25.420 --> 08:26.750
Oh, she will.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.670
After she
embarrasses herself,

08:28.670 --> 08:30.830
no one will ever
let me...

08:30.830 --> 08:34.000
- I mean, Naomi
forget it.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.750
Forget Naomi's
amazing quinceañera, of course.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.830
And what brings
you here today, doña?

08:40.830 --> 08:44.080
I was just checking
to see if you had
given up yet.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.250
I know it must be
terribly hard,

08:46.250 --> 08:48.960
training a girl
who was raised on a ship.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.290
She's much more accustomed
to swabbing a deck.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.380
Swabbing a deck?

08:54.380 --> 08:57.210
Right, she was
raised on a ship, wasn't she?

08:57.210 --> 09:00.000
Ahem, well, we must get
back to Naomi.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.830
See you at
the party, doña.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.290
Oh, I'll be there.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.250
Along with
the rest of the kingdom.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.710
I knew you'd
come around.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.790
Huh? Yes, yes.
Do me a favor.

09:10.790 --> 09:13.170
Fetch your umbrella
and meet me in the music room.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.830
An umbrella?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.580
Now, Miss Turner,

09:17.580 --> 09:21.120
the waltz is the heart
of the royal quinceañera.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.960
Imagine the kingdom's
finest orchestra

09:22.960 --> 09:25.420
playing just for you.

09:27.580 --> 09:30.790
Oh, thank you, chancellor.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.670
What's with
the water buckets?

09:35.670 --> 09:38.290
Oof! You had to ask?

09:38.290 --> 09:40.880
Is this not how you
carry water on a ship?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.460
Yeah, but we're not
on a ship.

09:43.460 --> 09:47.040
Ah, I cannot put
anything past you,
Miss Turner.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.120
Now, chin up,
shoulders back.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.920
Stomach in,
arms up, elbows out.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.580
Perfect.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.960
It doesn't feel perfect.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.620
Maestro.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.710
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

09:59.710 --> 10:02.120
NAOMI: Whoa, no, no,
whoa, no, no.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.710
- I told you to bring
an umbrella.
- Sorry.

10:06.710 --> 10:08.290
Stop thinking about
the steps,

10:08.290 --> 10:10.710
and start thinking about
how you keep your balance

10:10.710 --> 10:13.290
when you are on
a moving ship.

10:13.290 --> 10:15.000
Okay.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.880
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.500
Hey, look at you.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.790
I think I'm getting
the hang of it.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.460
Yes, yes.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.960
Extremely excited
to be reunited.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.080
Ha ha! That's it!

10:43.080 --> 10:45.790

12:07.880 --> 12:09.040
ESTEBAN:
It's perfect.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.040
- I want it.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.210
It has
a lot of ruffles.

12:12.210 --> 12:13.960
The rufflier, the better.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.330
Her dress must be
the fanciest of them all.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.170
The fanciest

Well, I, for one,
am dazzled.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.790
That's one way
of putting it.

12:56.790 --> 12:58.290
Now that we've
taken care of my dress,

12:58.290 --> 12:59.580
we have to do Elena's.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.580
Oh, that's okay.
I have a ball gown.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.670
That old thing?

13:03.670 --> 13:06.500
No, no, you must have
a brand-new dress.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.170
Naomi, I don't know.

13:08.170 --> 13:10.500
All right,
let's see it.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.420
ESTEBAN: Simply...

13:14.420 --> 13:16.880
BOTH: ...perfect.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.460
But this has more ruffles
than your dress.

13:19.460 --> 13:22.290
Elena, there can never be
too many ruffles.

13:22.290 --> 13:25.290
Ruffles are
my signature look.

13:25.290 --> 13:27.040
Okay.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.540
Naomi, your royal court
is here for waltz rehearsal.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.040
Splendid.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.290
Meet us in the throne room
after you change.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.380
Why, thank you,
chancellor.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.620
Abuela, I'm gonna ask you
a question,

13:38.620 --> 13:40.620
and I need you
to be honest.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.170
- It's hideous.

13:42.170 --> 13:45.120
Then tell Naomi
you don't want to wear it.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.620
I can't.
Naomi's my friend,

13:47.620 --> 13:49.120
and it's her day.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.460
If this is what she wants,
then this is what I'll wear.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.120
- Elena!
- Hey!

13:55.120 --> 13:58.460
What do you know?
The ruffles broke my fall.

14:04.330 --> 14:07.540
- One more time,
from the top.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.670
We've been practicing
all day.

14:09.670 --> 14:13.040
And yet, there is no evidence
of it in your dancing.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.290
Elbows up,
back straight,
look forward.

14:15.290 --> 14:16.670
Isn't that what I'm doing?

14:16.670 --> 14:18.620
No, you're not.
Now focus.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.790
I don't want you
to embarrass me tomorrow night.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.540
- Ow!
- Sorry.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.000
- My fault.
- Gabe.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.620
Are your feet
glued to the floor?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.790
- Move, move, move.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.960
Naomi, may I
have a word?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.620
In private.

14:36.620 --> 14:39.000
Gladly.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.710
Okay, so what did Esteban
do with the real Naomi?

14:42.710 --> 14:44.460
I don't know.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.460
Can't you cough up a spell
and get her back?

14:46.460 --> 14:49.000
You guys, she's just
a little worried
about her party.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.710
- Okay, a lot.

14:50.710 --> 14:54.290
But it's her big day.
Let's try to be understanding.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.460
I will not allow
Naomi's royal quinceañera

14:56.460 --> 14:58.500
to be ruined by
uncoordinated

14:58.500 --> 15:00.960
and undisciplined
friends.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.040
So I am bringing in
professional dancers

15:04.040 --> 15:06.210
from the royal academy
to replace you.

15:06.210 --> 15:08.960
!
- After all that
practicing?

15:08.960 --> 15:12.500
You're not really gonna
let Esteban replace us, are you?

15:12.500 --> 15:14.670
Not you.

15:14.670 --> 15:15.960
Just Gabe and Mateo.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.710
!
- Hey, that's okay.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.210
We don't need to be
on her court.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.420
We don't need
to be there at all.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.210
Yeah, we wouldn't want
to embarrass you.

15:24.210 --> 15:26.540
Oh, Gabe, you guys
won't embarrass me...

15:26.540 --> 15:28.500
as long as
you're not dancing.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.330
- Let's get outta
here, Mateo.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.380
I'm sorry, guys.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.960
- I'll talk to her.
- Don't bother.

15:36.620 --> 15:40.500
Naomi, I can't believe
how rude you were to
Gabe and Mateo.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.170
I'm sorry, but the dance
needs to be perfect.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.880
After all,
the waltz is...

15:45.880 --> 15:48.670
BOTH: The heart of
the quinceañera.

15:48.670 --> 15:51.290
Well, if that's
what you really think,

15:51.290 --> 15:53.120
you're missing
the whole point of the party.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.960
On the contrary,
for once,

15:54.960 --> 15:57.790
Miss Turner actually
knows what she's talking about.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.620
If Gabe and Mateo
are off your court,

15:59.620 --> 16:01.120
then I'm out, too.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.500
If you're going
to be like that,

16:02.500 --> 16:03.880
maybe you shouldn't
be on it.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.120
Okay then.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.880
I'm leaving.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.500
I see that.

16:15.710 --> 16:18.380
I can't believe
she didn't stop me.

16:18.380 --> 16:21.000
I can't believe
she left.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.500
You did the right thing.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.380
Then why do I feel
so bad?

16:24.380 --> 16:26.290
You will feel
much better tomorrow,

16:26.290 --> 16:29.580
when everybody's talking
about your flawless
royal quinceañera.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.080
We worked too hard.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.080
It has to be perfect.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.670
ABUELA: The palace
looks amazing.

16:40.670 --> 16:44.120
Yes. Completely
transformed.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.460
I doubt the same
applies to Naomi.

16:46.460 --> 16:49.040
Ah, well, you will have
to just wait and see.

16:51.380 --> 16:53.120
ARMANDO:
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:53.120 --> 16:57.500
I present to you
Miss Naomi Turner.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.040
Yes, yes!

17:07.040 --> 17:09.000
She's gliding.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.500
She's gliding!

17:11.960 --> 17:14.880
I am delighted
you were invited.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.790
Extremely excited
to be reunited.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.210
This cannot be
the same girl.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.830
Chancellor Esteban
is a miracle worker.

17:25.830 --> 17:27.540
Yes, this is true.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.960
She may look and act
like a proper lady,

17:29.960 --> 17:32.460
but can she dance
like one?

17:34.210 --> 17:35.830
Who are they?

17:35.830 --> 17:37.580
Naomi's court.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.670
Who? Oh, they
could not dance,

17:42.670 --> 17:43.790
so Naomi replaced them.

17:43.790 --> 17:46.620
How do you replace
your friends?

17:46.620 --> 17:48.620
You don't.

17:48.620 --> 17:50.120
Let me handle this.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.380
Do you think
she even cares
that we're not there?

17:57.290 --> 17:59.710
I don't know.

18:05.790 --> 18:07.460
Excuse me.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.250
May I have
your attention?

18:10.880 --> 18:12.000
Ay!

18:12.000 --> 18:13.880
Good evening.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.960
I'd like to thank everyone
for coming to our home,

18:15.960 --> 18:18.620
and helping us celebrate
Naomi's birthday.

18:20.500 --> 18:26.000
A quinceañera is a day
to honor the birthday girl.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.710
And since family
and friends

18:28.710 --> 18:30.790
are the heart
of the quinceañera,

18:30.790 --> 18:34.040
it is also a time
when the birthday girl

18:34.040 --> 18:36.000
honors those
closest to her.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.880
When I had
my quinceañera,

18:38.880 --> 18:41.880
many, many
years ago,

18:41.880 --> 18:45.170
I took the birthday
candles off my cake,

18:45.170 --> 18:47.330
and I gave them to
my dearest friends.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.790
I wanted to show them
how much they meant to me.

18:50.790 --> 18:53.210
I invite you to continue
the tradition

18:53.210 --> 18:56.620
by passing out candles
to your closest friends.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.120
Of course.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.210
Uh... um...

19:03.210 --> 19:05.670
my...

19:05.670 --> 19:08.880
My closest friends
aren't here.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.040
But they should be,
don't you think?

19:12.040 --> 19:15.210
You're right.
I have to go.

19:15.210 --> 19:17.000
Miss Turner.
What are you doing?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.880
Wait!

19:18.880 --> 19:20.620
Running out
of her own party.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.250
What a disaster!

19:22.250 --> 19:24.330
Avalor will be
talking about this fiasco

19:24.330 --> 19:26.710
for years.

19:26.710 --> 19:30.830
Naomi?
What are you doing here?

19:30.830 --> 19:34.620
Yeah, don't you have a party
to be the bright light of?

19:34.620 --> 19:36.580
Yeah.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.540
I guess I got
a little carried away

19:38.540 --> 19:40.920
- with making things perfect.
!

19:40.920 --> 19:42.960
Okay, a lot.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.120
The whole reason
I wanted to have a party
in the first place

19:46.120 --> 19:48.120
was to be with
my best friends.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.080
And the fanciest party
in the world

19:50.080 --> 19:53.790

20:24.790 --> 20:26.960
- Sure.
- I'm in.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.790
I don't know, do I have to
put on that ruffled dress?

20:29.790 --> 20:32.330
Nope. Just come as you are.

20:36.460 --> 20:39.000
Ah, Naomi.
We can still fix this.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Hurry. The dancers
are waiting.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.920
I'm sorry, Esteban,

20:42.920 --> 20:45.000
but I don't care if
my waltz isn't royal enough.

They really like it.

21:16.830 --> 21:19.540
Avalor will be talking
about this party

21:19.540 --> 21:21.290
for years to come.

21:21.290 --> 21:24.170
Oh, I will make sure
of that.

21:24.170 --> 21:26.000
Hmmph!

21:26.000 --> 21:28.500
And now, for
your birthday present.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.460
