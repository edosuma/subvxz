WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:03.197
Agh!

00:03.200 --> 00:05.192
Jack Ramsay died.
I'm sorry, Eva,

00:05.200 --> 00:06.759
<i>you'll be prosecuted
for murder.</i>

00:06.760 --> 00:09.355
I have written a tract
which identifies

00:09.360 --> 00:11.158
all the water sources
within Five Points

00:11.160 --> 00:12.674
at risk of contamination.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.194
You'll find this
a little more exciting

00:14.200 --> 00:16.157
<i>than your husband's strain,
I think.</i>

00:16.160 --> 00:17.833
I'm looking for
a Detective Corcoran.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.513
My name's
Teresa Trembley..

00:19.520 --> 00:22.115
Arrange for Teresa's
hiding, now.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.670
Remember that she only
just learned her sons died.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.589
And what happens
when she learns

00:27.600 --> 00:29.353
the truth
of those deaths?

00:30.360 --> 00:31.953
Did you explain
to Mister Lansing

00:31.960 --> 00:33.838
<i>that his regrets came
too late?</i>

00:33.840 --> 00:35.797
I did, with pleasure.

00:35.800 --> 00:36.870
Proceed.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.234
<i>You want the gloves
to come off,</i>

00:38.240 --> 00:39.640
<i>then so be it.</i>

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

01:25.880 --> 01:30.875
<i>Christ the Lord is risen today</i>

01:31.160 --> 01:36.030
<i>Alleluia</i>

01:37.080 --> 01:42.075
<i>Earth and heaven
in chorus say,</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:47.954
<i>Alleluia.</i>

01:49.600 --> 01:51.751
Episcopal hymns.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.310
Sound like swine being
led to a slaughter.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.398
Simply awful.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.040
Captain, your men will shutter
Eva's Paradise tonight.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.315
Yes, sir.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.951
Well, how is it gonna help Eva
if we close her business?

02:04.960 --> 02:05.950
She'll go broke.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.076
Once again you fail to see

02:07.080 --> 02:08.514
beyond the parameters
of Five Points.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.512
We are offering
those Greenwich Village bigots

02:10.520 --> 02:12.034
a sign of good faith.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.679
<i>This is bigger
than one lowly immigrant.</i>

02:13.680 --> 02:15.273
That lowly immigrant
made The Paradise home

02:15.280 --> 02:17.033
to half the sixth ward,
including you.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.713
Chain of command,
Corcoran.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.710
<i>Jesus Christ almighty!</i>

02:19.720 --> 02:21.951
I am sick and tired of your
saintly bullshit, Detective!

02:21.960 --> 02:24.555
Now either you get your lowly
immigrant arse in line

02:24.560 --> 02:25.550
and do as I say,

02:25.560 --> 02:27.392
or I have no further use
for ye!

02:27.400 --> 02:29.710
Why can't you pull rank
and get Eva out today?!

02:31.280 --> 02:32.396
He's a lawman who believes
in the law

02:32.400 --> 02:34.039
until it affects him.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.396
"Pull rank" you say,
hmm?

02:36.400 --> 02:39.757
We will exonerate Miss Heissen
by legal means.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.559
She's going to need capital
to afford a proper lawyer.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.472
And I plan on securing both.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.759
<i>Do you not trust me,
Kevin Corcoran?</i>

02:49.920 --> 02:52.196
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.996
Hey.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.791
He was snoring,

03:04.680 --> 03:08.469
always snoring,
sleeping on his side.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.036
So I took a ten penny nail

03:14.480 --> 03:17.200
and I swung the hammer
hard as I could.

03:18.200 --> 03:22.592
So here I sit,
waiting to hang.

03:24.840 --> 03:27.639
Sure gives ya time
to think, no?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.679
<i>Miss Heissen?</i>

03:33.560 --> 03:38.077
J.E. Lovrich,
attorney and savior.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.915
A man of contradictions.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.394
As amusing as your quips
might be,

03:45.400 --> 03:46.390
my time is short.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.756
I come to you
with an offer:

03:48.760 --> 03:50.513
Five thousand dollars
and I'll take your case.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.560
Five thousand dollars?

03:52.560 --> 03:53.960
Yes.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.155
Mister uh...

03:55.160 --> 03:56.992
- Lovrich.
- Lovrich.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.912
I don't have
that kind of money.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.072
If you wish to afford
my services,

04:02.080 --> 04:05.232
Mister Sutton,
rising real estate investor,

04:05.240 --> 04:06.913
holds the key.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.033
You'll see that
I have calculated all assets

04:12.040 --> 04:15.875
and all aspects of your saloon,
Miss Heissen.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.994
With due respect,
my offer is firm.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.514
I will not negotiate.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.874
You're asking me to sell
The Paradise.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.678
Everything I own?!

04:30.680 --> 04:35.675
<i>Madam, our professions
are not all that different.</i>

04:36.200 --> 04:39.591
Good service
does not come cheap.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.150
How did you know
I was here?

04:48.160 --> 04:50.356
General Donovan insists

04:50.360 --> 04:55.355
that the queen of Five Points
remain atop of her throne

04:55.760 --> 04:58.434
and away from the gallows.

04:58.440 --> 05:03.435
<i>Raise your joys
and triumphs high...</i>

05:06.120 --> 05:07.998
How long can they go on for?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.515
To Lieutenant General Grant!

05:10.520 --> 05:12.239
Richmond has fallen!

05:12.240 --> 05:14.550
<i>The end of the Confederacy
is near!</i>

05:16.120 --> 05:18.237
Cheers!

05:18.240 --> 05:19.310
<i>Police!</i>

05:19.320 --> 05:21.152
We need everyone out, now!

05:22.280 --> 05:23.760
<i>Everybody out!</i>

05:23.760 --> 05:24.796
Go on!

05:24.800 --> 05:26.154
Close it up.
Keep movin'!

05:26.160 --> 05:27.150
What the hell's
goin' on here?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.231
Eva's Paradise
is closing up shop, Richie.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.230
Corky?

05:30.240 --> 05:31.276
Look, no questions,
just go.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.999
Where?
We live here.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.150
You'll sleep
at the precinct.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.913
<i>- Get out!
- Let's go, top hat.</i>

05:38.920 --> 05:40.673
<i>On to Richmond!</i>

05:40.680 --> 05:42.956
Isn't that what we Union men
used to say?

05:50.080 --> 05:52.914
Today, Richmond is ours.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.479
And you turn your back
on all yer brothers

05:54.480 --> 05:57.359
who fought and died
for this hour.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.280
You're all copper now.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.237
No Union corporal
would ever steal this night

06:05.240 --> 06:06.230
away from us.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.516
That's enough.
Move on.

06:11.080 --> 06:16.075
<i>Al-le-lu-u-ia</i>

06:34.480 --> 06:35.596
Mister Donovan's not here,

06:35.600 --> 06:37.239
but he should be back
momentarily

06:37.240 --> 06:38.230
if you'd like to sit?

06:38.240 --> 06:39.560
We'll wait in there.

06:59.640 --> 07:04.271
"Where
a malignant and a turbaned Turk

07:04.280 --> 07:07.512
beat a Venetian
and traduced the state,

07:07.520 --> 07:09.512
I took by the throat
the circumcised dog

07:09.520 --> 07:11.796
and smote him, thus."

07:11.800 --> 07:13.029
Who reads that shit?

07:13.040 --> 07:15.680
Sounds like someone
who don't speak english no good,

07:16.280 --> 07:18.715
or like that drabble
from the, uh,

07:18.720 --> 07:20.712
<i>Bartlett kid's suicide note?</i>

07:24.440 --> 07:26.033
No.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.918
No, I thought we were here
for Eva.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.515
Corky, just 'cause he's got
the same book

07:29.520 --> 07:30.510
as some dead rich kid

07:30.520 --> 07:32.159
don't mean Donovan's involved
in anything.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.480
No, it doesn't,
but I need you to go

07:33.480 --> 07:34.755
back down to the precinct,

07:34.760 --> 07:37.195
<i>pull the Bartlett murder file
from storage.</i>

07:37.200 --> 07:39.192
What are you gonna do?

07:39.200 --> 07:42.511
I'd like to talk to Donovan,
alone.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.840
Why do I get the feeling
you're about to make

07:43.840 --> 07:45.399
all of New York quake?

07:46.840 --> 07:48.957
Considering that
Mister Lansing has sent word

07:48.960 --> 07:50.838
that he has chosen to,
instead,

07:50.840 --> 07:54.834
commence construction on a dam
outside Buenos Aires,

07:54.840 --> 07:56.877
The only qualifying bid
that remains

07:56.880 --> 07:59.395
is that of
General Brendan Donovan.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.358
Gentlemen, please!

08:04.360 --> 08:06.238
We will reconvene
in two days time,

08:06.240 --> 08:07.594
at nine o'clock,

08:07.600 --> 08:10.399
at which time the board
will hold a final vote

08:10.400 --> 08:11.914
on the sole proposal.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.400
Congratulations,
General.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.390
Thank you, sir.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.070
Congratulations,
General Donovan.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.595
Sisyphus of Five Points
may make his way

08:23.600 --> 08:25.114
to the mountaintop
after all.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.110
Thank you,
Mister Morehouse,

08:26.120 --> 08:28.510
I'm a firm believer
that a contract is not closed

08:28.520 --> 08:30.239
until signed.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.073
Alderman Stonington wishes
to meet with you privately.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.356
I do suggest that,
for the good of your proposal,

08:35.360 --> 08:37.272
you take the man up
on his offer.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.272
Tomorrow night,
my home?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.875
Oh, you must mean
your son's home?

08:42.880 --> 08:45.111
What time shall
I arrive?

08:45.120 --> 08:47.510
Seven thirty
should be fine.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.793
Missus Morehouse!
Missus Morehouse!

09:08.760 --> 09:11.150
James, answer me this...

09:11.720 --> 09:13.279
What hangs at a man's thigh

09:13.280 --> 09:16.591
that wants to poke a hole
it's often poked before?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.671
Oh, I don't know.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.114
A key.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.790
<i>Christ our Lord...</i>

09:26.800 --> 09:29.474
What is
the use of this instrument?

09:29.480 --> 09:30.994
Called a cytoscope.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.310
<i>Used to examine infections
in urine in the bladder.</i>

09:34.560 --> 09:35.914
This goes inside a man's--

09:35.920 --> 09:37.593
<i>Say what you
came here to say.</i>

09:40.600 --> 09:42.398
I have failed you.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.676
Your medical tract,
I cannot publish it.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.637
Oh, Major.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.871
No.

09:53.880 --> 09:58.272
"Major" is a title reserved
for one who deserves respect.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.475
<i>Robert,</i>

09:59.480 --> 10:02.120
I am tired of you
and your uptown bullshit...

10:02.120 --> 10:03.634
the lies,
the deceptions,

10:03.640 --> 10:05.597
the broken promises
that your people--

10:05.600 --> 10:07.512
Do not generalize.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.915
<i>Have I not been
charitable enough</i>

10:09.920 --> 10:12.310
to pay for
your medical practice?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.039
And what of reuniting Sara
with her mother?

10:14.040 --> 10:16.191
Friendly acts, yes,

10:16.200 --> 10:19.716
eclipsed by greedy exploits
of the general public!

10:19.720 --> 10:22.792
I have tried.
I am still trying.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.870
Trying to do what?

10:23.880 --> 10:25.951
To become...

10:25.960 --> 10:27.872
...something, someone who--

10:27.880 --> 10:31.032
Children and the elderly
are dying

10:31.040 --> 10:33.760
while you line your pockets
with cash!

10:33.760 --> 10:35.194
Now tell me,

10:35.200 --> 10:37.396
what are you buying
with that blood money?

10:37.400 --> 10:40.950
Another bottle of brandy?
A new suit?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.475
I sure as hell hope
it's worth the life of a child!

10:47.720 --> 10:49.712
Goddamn you, Freeman.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.871
<i>This bandage was clean
when I first examined him.</i>

10:57.880 --> 10:59.394
It's now stained with blood.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.438
Purple splotches on the face,
the eye is bloodshot.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.716
The other eye, if he had one,
would be the same.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.790
But it was
an open lesion,

11:05.800 --> 11:07.075
so the blood had
a way to escape.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.675
Through the stab wound,
hence the bloodstained bandage.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.273
What of the frothy spit
at his mouth?

11:11.280 --> 11:12.600
Same as the eyes
and face.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.637
When you abruptly cut off
a man's oxygen supply,

11:14.640 --> 11:16.359
this is the result.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.477
<i>All telltale signs
of suffocation.</i>

11:24.120 --> 11:26.351
Corky,
without evidence...

11:30.000 --> 11:31.639
Cut off a man's oxygen,
you say?

11:41.960 --> 11:44.475
Well, look at that
gleeful grin.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.278
What are you going on about?

11:46.280 --> 11:47.794
Momma.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.555
Well, if you must know,
I met someone.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.031
<i>No, not like that.</i>

11:54.040 --> 11:55.679
A man, though.

11:55.680 --> 11:59.151
His name is Tommy,
like your brother.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.710
Would you believe
he has been working for J.D.?

12:02.720 --> 12:04.200
The field hand?

12:04.200 --> 12:06.760
Except J.D. is not on
the plantation anymore.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.433
He living up north of here.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.036
Got a apple orchard
all his own.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.670
My Lord, good for him.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.273
Yes.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.034
I had the most curious moment,
Sara.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.838
<i>It dawned on me:</i>

12:24.840 --> 12:29.596
I was standing in the store
buying food...

12:29.600 --> 12:32.240
...and nobody had sent me.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.311
<i>I went there
on my own accord</i>

12:34.320 --> 12:37.631
because I wanted flour,
I wanted rice.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.438
I remember that moment,

12:39.440 --> 12:41.716
except I had a bag of sugar
under my arm.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.916
You and your sweet tooth!

12:45.400 --> 12:47.710
<i>I see you and Matthew,</i>

12:47.720 --> 12:51.475
going about your life,
doing whatever you please.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.394
It's beautiful to watch.
I just...

12:58.320 --> 13:01.711
I'm unsure of what
to make of it all.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.513
You'll know soon enough.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.589
Tell me about
your new friend, Tommy.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.071
He says that up north of here
there's these skinny lakes...

13:13.080 --> 13:14.799
that they just stretch
for miles.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.280
And they call 'em
finger lakes,

13:16.280 --> 13:19.956
'cause they long and slender
like piano fingers.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.156
Look like they belong
to the hands of God.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.392
<i>J.D. 's orchard is at the edge
of one of 'em!</i>

13:25.400 --> 13:29.030
Lake, um, Canaga.
Wait, Lake...

13:29.880 --> 13:30.950
Canandaigua?

13:31.080 --> 13:32.594
See, that's it!
That's the one!

13:34.080 --> 13:35.833
<i>Tommy goes up there
every summer,</i>

13:35.840 --> 13:37.069
and then in the fall,

13:37.080 --> 13:39.959
him and J.D.,
they pick apples off the trees.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.913
"There's nothing like autumn
upstate New York," Tommy said.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.152
"October will break your heart.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.153
<i>You never want
the days to end."</i>

13:51.160 --> 13:52.640
<i>Then he smiled,</i>

13:52.640 --> 13:55.792
and offered me a job
to work!

13:55.800 --> 13:57.792
<i>I had to laugh.</i>

13:57.800 --> 14:00.520
A old woman like me
workin' the land

14:00.520 --> 14:01.920
for the first time.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.116
I said,
"I was in the house, Tommy."

14:10.520 --> 14:12.159
I would like to see
those beautiful leaves

14:12.160 --> 14:13.753
one day though.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.639
Ya settling in okay?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.320
I suppose so.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.509
I mean, I'm grateful
for all of this,

14:30.520 --> 14:34.150
I just never saw
anyone die before.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.840
<i>Watching Alderman Bartlett,</i>

14:38.840 --> 14:40.559
the struggle,

14:41.840 --> 14:44.912
him gasping,
convulsing, I...

14:46.200 --> 14:47.919
Just the images keep
circling in my mind.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.354
I can't make them stop.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.430
I'm sorry.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.352
Don't be.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.194
You've been goin' through
some tough times, Teresa.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.116
But you don't have to go
through them alone anymore.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.634
What is it?

15:14.040 --> 15:15.110
You remind me
of someone.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.952
Who's that?

15:17.960 --> 15:20.520
<i>Just... from my past.</i>

15:21.840 --> 15:24.560
Years ago in Ireland,
when I was a wee lad.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.040
And?

15:26.040 --> 15:28.874
It's only I haven't
thought about her in years.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.553
Do you miss her?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.199
I didn't 'til I met you.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.351
Line by line...

15:45.880 --> 15:48.156
The words match
Bartlett's suicide note.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.555
Hey, Glynn.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.680
Get these back down in storage,
would ya?

15:53.720 --> 15:54.790
Right away, detective.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.869
So Donovan and the Bartlett kid
liked the same lousy poetry.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.439
You have a lot more faith
in coincidence than I do.

16:48.760 --> 16:49.796
I gotta ask.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.555
Donovan has been
acting peculiar lately.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.429
Anything you can tell me
about your past together?

16:56.440 --> 16:57.999
<i>The business,
the girls,</i>

16:58.000 --> 17:00.595
<i>whatever type of business
you two have on the side?</i>

17:04.240 --> 17:06.675
Does he get his hands dirty
or does he...

17:07.240 --> 17:09.071
<i>Does he hire outside
for that?</i>

17:11.359 --> 17:13.431
Do you realize that I'm...

17:13.440 --> 17:15.557
I'm trying to help you,
right?

17:15.560 --> 17:18.119
<i>Because from what I see,</i>

17:18.119 --> 17:21.113
<i>Donovan's assistance
only brings you losses.</i>

17:21.119 --> 17:23.112
First, he shuts down
The Paradise,

17:23.119 --> 17:24.109
and then he wants you
to sell.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.520
He did what?

17:30.200 --> 17:33.193
He's the father,
isn't he?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.630
Corky... be careful.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.635
Donovan is not a man
to be trifled with.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.837
Schedule my carriage
for seven o'clock.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.240
I'll be going
to the Morehouse mansion

17:49.240 --> 17:50.390
on West 23rd Street.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.430
Yes, sir, Mister Donovan.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.837
Detective Corcoran. Hmm.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.878
<i>Just the man
I was hoping to find.</i>

17:57.880 --> 18:00.395
I was out of line yesterday,
hmm?

18:01.920 --> 18:04.958
The lads in the sixth precinct
hold you in such high esteem

18:04.960 --> 18:08.317
for the very characteristics
I criticized.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.594
<i>Truth is,
you're a finer copper</i>

18:11.600 --> 18:13.080
than I ever was.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.758
I was just noticing
your old badge.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.912
Hmm...
Some of my fondest days.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.479
<i>I wanted to tell you,
I've been realizing</i>

18:21.480 --> 18:24.314
<i>that you were right all along</i>

18:24.320 --> 18:26.710
about police work being easier
than I make it.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.279
In certain cases, yes,
but--

18:28.280 --> 18:29.270
<i>The lines are clear:</i>

18:29.280 --> 18:30.509
Black and white,
good and bad.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.399
We serve,
we bring the bad in for justice.

18:33.400 --> 18:37.110
It's simple.
Retribution for crime.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.351
Isn't that the most...

18:39.360 --> 18:42.637
...satisfying part
of the job?

18:42.640 --> 18:44.199
The retribution?

18:47.320 --> 18:49.152
Absolutely.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.760
Y'see,
I'm still learning from you yet.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.550
I thought you just asked me
to formulate a lie.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.313
One which I will state
as fact,

19:08.320 --> 19:10.835
in order to scare
General Brendan Donovan

19:10.840 --> 19:12.797
because you have a hunch
he may be up to no good?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.280
What, you're gonna tell me
this is the first untruth

19:14.280 --> 19:15.634
you've told
to a higher rank?

19:15.640 --> 19:17.154
What if you're onto something,
Corky?

19:17.160 --> 19:18.389
Have you reached
the level of confidence

19:18.400 --> 19:20.392
at which you think you can
depose a Tammany ward boss?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.960
Just please do me
this favor?

19:23.320 --> 19:25.596
Don't worry about any fallout,
all right?

19:25.600 --> 19:27.671
And what of implicating me
into this scheme of yours?

19:28.680 --> 19:33.596
You are millionaire,
Major Robert Morehouse.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.716
Tammany Hall needs people
like you

19:34.720 --> 19:36.359
to keep the city afloat.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.070
Huh.

19:43.680 --> 19:47.640
Soon a new New York
for its new people.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.360
And what of this city's past?

19:50.360 --> 19:53.671
Men such as we
laid its foundations.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.592
You cannot change history.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.399
No, but I can control
its future.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.596
An Irish Napoleon
in our midst.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.240
Do remember,
General Donovan, as committee chair,

20:03.240 --> 20:08.235
I control when and if
the Aqueduct vote happens.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.113
The vote is to be
tomorrow morn.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.999
Yes, but first I need to meet
with my esteemed brother

20:13.000 --> 20:16.789
who runs a highly regarded
engineering firm.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.717
By any chance, is your brother
Kenneth Stonington?

20:23.320 --> 20:24.310
The very same.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.312
Uncanny.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.232
My research tells me
he's the best.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.356
I had no other in mind

20:29.360 --> 20:31.397
to which to offer
the engineering venture

20:31.400 --> 20:33.119
of the Aqueduct.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.510
I can only hope
your brother will accept.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.512
I'm certain
he'll be interested.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.832
Shall we take
a recess from business?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.151
The neighborhood is afire
with whispers

20:48.160 --> 20:49.640
of last month's scandal.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.677
Christ, which scandal?

20:53.240 --> 20:55.675
Seems the Bartlett family
is unsatisfied

20:55.680 --> 20:57.080
with the way the police
handled the deaths

20:57.080 --> 20:59.879
of Alderman Bartlett
and his son, Benjamin.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.673
They have gone as far as
to enlist the governor's office

21:04.680 --> 21:08.594
to reopen the investigation.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.430
Hmm.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.351
Sorry to bother you.
Matthew around?

21:32.360 --> 21:34.158
Well, he and Sara went out.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.240
Did he leave
a report for me, by chance,

21:38.240 --> 21:40.471
With the name Jack Ramsay
on it?

21:40.480 --> 21:41.800
He didn't mention anything,

21:41.800 --> 21:44.793
and I never heard him
say that name.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.871
No, I don't see anything.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.270
All right.
Evening.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.118
I don't believe
I thanked you properly

22:00.120 --> 22:02.191
for helping with
Ellen's wake.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.839
No need to, sir.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.277
<i>I appreciate all you did,</i>

22:07.280 --> 22:10.478
dressing her...
and making her up.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.676
It was beautiful,
even joyful,

22:12.680 --> 22:15.991
how everybody came together
to say goodbye.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.038
It reminded me of a wake
at the plantation.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.032
Never thought you could
compare an Irish wake

22:21.040 --> 22:23.396
with a Southern
slave wake.

22:23.400 --> 22:26.313
Oh, they are more similar
than you know.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.277
The singin' and dancin',

22:28.920 --> 22:32.596
a celebration of life,
pathway to heaven.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.911
You see, as a slave,

22:35.920 --> 22:38.594
a funeral tells you
that the dead,

22:38.600 --> 22:41.069
their lives had dignity
and meaning

22:41.080 --> 22:43.356
beyond unholy bondage.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.155
My wife was no slave,
but she was...

22:48.160 --> 22:50.038
...oppressed by guilt.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.396
And I guess...
you can run away

22:52.400 --> 22:54.198
from that oppression,
the bondage,

22:54.200 --> 22:57.591
but there's always a chance
it'll catch up with you.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.312
Like my Ellen
and your boys.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.998
My boys?

23:04.200 --> 23:08.558
I know living in this city
must be hard for ya.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.710
Even now...

23:11.240 --> 23:15.075
...stood next to an Irishman
you know yet little,

23:15.080 --> 23:17.800
an Irishman you've been
very kind to...

23:17.800 --> 23:21.510
but still a man
who is of the same race

23:21.520 --> 23:24.399
of the men
who lynched your boys.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.830
I thought for certain...

23:42.840 --> 23:46.072
drowning was a terrible way
to die.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.920
I lay awake at night

23:48.920 --> 23:53.915
praying that their last moments
were peaceful and painless.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.272
But beaten? Lynched?!

23:58.280 --> 23:59.760
Set afire?!

23:59.760 --> 24:00.750
Oh, momma--

24:00.760 --> 24:02.991
No, stay away from me,
child!

24:03.000 --> 24:05.196
I do not want
your touch!

24:05.200 --> 24:06.475
Please.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.597
I was just trying to shield you
from the hellish truth--

24:08.600 --> 24:12.753
My sons escaped the bondage
of the South,

24:12.760 --> 24:16.356
only to die here
at the hand of savages?!

24:17.720 --> 24:19.712
<i>Keep it down,
will ya?</i>

24:19.720 --> 24:21.074
You tell me,

24:21.080 --> 24:25.199
what the point of risking life
for freedom was?

24:25.200 --> 24:28.716
<i>We should have told you, yes.</i>

24:28.720 --> 24:32.236
But know that our dishonesty
came from a place of love.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.357
I trusted you.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.314
I invented the lie.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.437
For you.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.591
For me.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.795
Because I thought that
you would need it

24:47.800 --> 24:48.995
as much as I do.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.310
They were my babies!

24:58.760 --> 25:01.320
What kind of woman
has this vicious city

25:01.320 --> 25:03.152
turned you into?

25:16.920 --> 25:18.718
Where's the file
for the Bartlett case?

25:18.720 --> 25:20.916
<i>Benjamin's suicide note?</i>

25:20.920 --> 25:23.754
How many times
are we gonna have this dance?

25:23.760 --> 25:27.037
Look, I'm not playing the role
of the asshole captain now.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.557
Donovan is pissed.
Your job is on the line.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.075
I searched through storage
and it was there yesterday.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.595
Today, nothing.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.193
The governor's office
sent a man down here tonight

25:38.200 --> 25:39.634
to pick it up.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.951
They're taking over
the investigation privately.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.475
Meaning without you.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.709
That was fast.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.870
What?

25:50.760 --> 25:52.797
Watched the autopsy today.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.554
Jack Ramsay was murdered,
suffocated.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.712
So now you're chasing
two stale cases:

25:58.720 --> 25:59.710
Bartlett and Ramsay?

25:59.720 --> 26:03.475
Are you covering for him?
For Donovan?

26:03.480 --> 26:05.711
What in hell
are you talking about?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.993
One case.
I am only chasin' one.

26:18.720 --> 26:19.836
The Bartlett evidence.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.115
Hmm.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.596
Did you tell Captain Sullivan
who you were?

26:24.600 --> 26:27.479
Robert Marchant,
from Governor Fenton's office.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.880
Ah.

26:32.080 --> 26:35.756
Family murder-suicide.
Tragic, isn't it?

26:37.520 --> 26:41.196
I had a brother, Gregor.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.510
He was younger than me.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.719
And I realized I haven't thought
about him in a long time.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.189
But since I'm in here,

26:50.200 --> 26:53.034
I have these haunting memories
of him.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.910
When my brother Gregor
was nine years old,

26:56.920 --> 27:00.516
he didn't even flinch
in the face of death.

27:00.520 --> 27:05.436
He suffered coughing fits
and fevers.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.432
He didn't even waver.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.554
<i>On his last night,</i>

27:11.560 --> 27:14.758
Gregor told me
and my sisters goodbye,

27:14.760 --> 27:16.831
that he loved us,

27:16.840 --> 27:19.400
and then he was gone.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.871
There was no fear.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.633
<i>No fear.</i>

27:24.640 --> 27:26.199
I got no fear of dying.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.160
Hell, this life was sure
miserable enough.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.392
How much worse could
the next one be?

27:37.440 --> 27:38.794
Next?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.200
What if there is no next?

27:44.040 --> 27:49.035
I have spent months
staring at these dingy walls,

27:49.400 --> 27:52.040
lying in utter darkness.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.396
If there's nothing
but black for me

27:55.400 --> 27:58.359
after I hang...

27:58.360 --> 28:01.000
...it ain't any different
than what I got now.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.676
What'll I care being dead,
anyway?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.838
I have yet to see
your bride tonight.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.832
I'd rather not discuss
the matter.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.233
As you are aware,
tomorrow morning,

28:35.240 --> 28:37.436
General Donovan
will be awarded the bid

28:37.440 --> 28:39.830
for the New Croton Aqueduct.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.797
He has presented us
with offers

28:41.800 --> 28:44.872
for each of the properties
we own in Five Points.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.280
Generous offers.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.431
Why would Donovan want more
Five Points real estate?

28:48.440 --> 28:49.635
He has plenty.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.154
Plenty is never enough.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.120
Besides, geographically
and pragmatically,

28:55.120 --> 28:56.190
the realty's in the way.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.429
Construction of the aqueduct

28:57.440 --> 28:59.432
will raze the majority
of the neighborhood,

28:59.440 --> 29:01.238
- at which point--
<i>- One moment, father.</i>

29:02.200 --> 29:04.157
Donovan's gonna level
his own ward?

29:05.160 --> 29:07.391
And we're gonna aid
this act;

29:07.400 --> 29:09.915
his displacing
the very constituents

29:09.920 --> 29:11.149
he claims to protect?

29:13.040 --> 29:16.078
You had no such protest
last autumn,

29:17.120 --> 29:19.760
purchasing the mother
A.M.E. Zion Church

29:19.760 --> 29:21.991
during our efforts
to demolish that cesspool

29:22.000 --> 29:23.673
to build a new Downtown.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.879
Robert,
you'd better soon decide

29:28.880 --> 29:31.236
where your values lie.

29:31.240 --> 29:35.029
Like a circus performer,
you walk a tightrope.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.517
On one platform:
a life of blind naivete,

29:39.520 --> 29:42.558
a life which you seem
to believe virtuous.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.315
On the other platform:
reality,

29:46.320 --> 29:49.711
our business,
your future.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.996
Let me guess, father.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.071
The longer I walk
the tightrope,

29:54.080 --> 29:56.470
the higher the likelihood
that I fall.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.913
Missus Morehouse.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.439
Lie down here.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.712
No, stay there.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.116
Yes.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.999
Yes.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.560
Now, relax.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.958
Should the doubts
surrounding the Bartlett case

32:07.960 --> 32:09.030
be made public,

32:09.040 --> 32:10.872
such scandal
will disturb Tammany.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.394
I understand, sir, but--

32:12.400 --> 32:14.357
The organization's
primary focus

32:14.360 --> 32:17.194
is to benefit our city,
our people!

32:17.200 --> 32:18.520
We cannot jeopardize
all that's been gained

32:18.520 --> 32:20.239
over one random slut.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.310
When she's gone,

32:21.320 --> 32:23.039
the past will remain
in the past.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.032
Mister Donovan,
is there no other option?

32:25.040 --> 32:26.360
Send her away,
pay her off!

32:26.360 --> 32:27.840
Do you have a problem
with your orders, Detective?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.593
For I seem to recall
you sacrificed two women

32:29.600 --> 32:31.273
to cover your own misdeeds.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.078
Hmm? Forgive my lack
of compassion

32:33.080 --> 32:34.958
for your newfound
sensitivity,

32:34.960 --> 32:36.713
but I don't give a shite!

32:36.720 --> 32:39.030
And I possess a LeMat revolver
and two bullets,

32:39.040 --> 32:42.112
which I am confident
don't care either.

32:42.120 --> 32:45.591
You will kill
Teresa Trembley tonight.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.193
Am I understood?

33:11.640 --> 33:13.120
Move!
Hey!

33:22.440 --> 33:23.556
<i>You should be good
for a while.</i>

33:23.560 --> 33:27.520
I got your bread
and your sausages,

33:27.520 --> 33:28.954
and a bit of cheese there.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.952
Tell me, Francis.
Who was she?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.312
A childhood darling.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.917
Maeve was her name.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.310
I was only nine,
but first love and all.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.477
You got the same curious eyes.

33:46.480 --> 33:50.679
Always watchin',
wantin' to know more.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.993
Before I left Ireland,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.232
we made a pact
that we'd see each other again.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.760
I made a lot of promises
I never made good on.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.152
You'd like to see
Maeve again.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.876
Let me be your Maeve.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.512
The way you are...

34:24.840 --> 34:27.878
No man has ever treated me
this well.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.670
You deserve better than that,
Miss Trembley.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.034
You deserve the best.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.917
Francis...

35:16.360 --> 35:19.000
I'm not the best.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.315
Far from it.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.792
The last honest kiss I had
only led to sorrow.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.397
I'm leaving this city.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.759
I don't know where
I'm supposed to be

35:45.760 --> 35:47.319
or what my life
is supposed to be,

35:47.320 --> 35:52.156
but this...
this Five Points...

35:52.160 --> 35:54.675
It's yours,
it's not mine.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.596
If I were brilliant,
Momma,

35:56.600 --> 36:00.594
I would think of a way
to say that I'm sorry

36:00.600 --> 36:03.240
so that you could
forgive me.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.630
I know why you did
what you did.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.240
I will always love you,
Sara,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.675
and there's nothing that
can change that.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.757
I wish I hadn't have lied.

36:27.480 --> 36:30.279
Wantin' to carry heavy truths
for the sake of others

36:30.280 --> 36:34.797
is what we do when we feel...
brave and whole.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.199
Something I used to be...

36:40.200 --> 36:41.873
I need to become again.

36:47.800 --> 36:48.995
Where will you go?

36:52.840 --> 36:53.830
I don't know just yet.

36:58.840 --> 37:03.073
I held North in my heart so long
I gave y'all up to it,

37:05.840 --> 37:09.720
But this...
this ain't my North.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.513
Maybe I'll take Mister Tommy
up on his offer

37:15.520 --> 37:17.989
and go see J.D.'s orchards

37:19.200 --> 37:21.192
and those rolling hills.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.359
Canandaigua Lake.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.077
One of God's fingers.

37:31.400 --> 37:35.633
I hope you find
your freedom, momma.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.839
No! No! No! No! No!

37:41.840 --> 37:44.230
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

37:44.240 --> 37:46.550
Please, please God!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

37:46.560 --> 37:48.756
Please, please, let me live!
Let me live!

37:48.760 --> 37:50.717
<i>Please!
Gimme another chance!</i>

37:52.360 --> 37:55.478
Please, I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die! Don't!

37:55.480 --> 37:57.551
<i>Let me live!
No! Please! Please!</i>

37:57.560 --> 38:00.553
<i>Please just don't kill me!
No!</i>

38:00.560 --> 38:02.870
<i>No!</i>

38:11.960 --> 38:13.235
Doctor...

38:14.760 --> 38:17.150
About my shop window...

38:21.080 --> 38:22.434
Ah, ah, ah...

38:38.680 --> 38:40.194
This makes you feel better,
does it?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.471
Waste of energy,
you ask me.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.115
This puzzle is not
comin' together!

38:48.120 --> 38:50.032
Maybe there ain't
no puzzle.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.396
Men in power
always want more.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.959
Same goes for men
with money.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.350
They'll do anything
to pump the well.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.114
It's just how it is,
how it's always been.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.510
Mankind doesn't change.

39:03.280 --> 39:06.193
So your ramblin' philosophy
of man

39:06.200 --> 39:07.634
means that
Donovan's crooked?

39:07.640 --> 39:09.632
Philosophy don't matter...

39:09.640 --> 39:10.630
<i>But he is.</i>

39:11.880 --> 39:14.349
And if you're willin',

39:14.360 --> 39:16.238
I need your help.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.754
I got myself
in a big pile of shit

39:17.760 --> 39:19.240
workin' for that man.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.391
I don't know what
Donovan wants,

39:21.400 --> 39:23.153
or what he's trying to do,

39:23.160 --> 39:25.038
but there's a big trail
of blood behind it.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.111
They had me shake down
Orrin Lansing.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.270
They?

39:29.280 --> 39:30.634
Donovan's got a guy,
a right hand man,

39:30.640 --> 39:32.199
I don't know his name.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.316
And what happened
with Lansing?

39:33.320 --> 39:34.879
A late night visit
that broke him.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.236
In return, Lansing killed
your man Milo O'Hearn.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.515
That's why
Lansing skipped town.

39:39.520 --> 39:40.510
No.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.318
Donovan believes
in mirrored punishment.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.720
Jesus Christ.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.712
<i>And Corky...</i>

39:45.720 --> 39:48.360
I've got your one
Teresa Trembley in hiding.

39:48.360 --> 39:51.717
<i>But tonight, Donovan
ordered me to silence her.</i>

39:51.720 --> 39:54.315
I can only imagine he's trying
to protect his own ass.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.673
You see, Teresa knows
who killed Alderman Bartlett.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.830
And right now,

40:01.840 --> 40:04.674
all the signs are pointing
up the ladder to Donovan.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.478
Goddamn it, Francis!

40:08.480 --> 40:10.517
Has Detective Maguire been
taking good care of you?

40:11.840 --> 40:13.513
He's been most kind.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.432
Ah, that's good,
that's good.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.159
Unfortunately,
Miss Trembley,

40:18.160 --> 40:21.232
our detectives have been
unable to locate anyone

40:21.240 --> 40:22.560
who matches the description
you gave

40:22.560 --> 40:25.280
of the Alderman's
wretched murderer.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.875
I'm at a loss, I...

40:28.880 --> 40:31.031
I told you everything I know.

40:31.040 --> 40:34.431
<i>His height, his eye color,
his hair...</i>

40:35.400 --> 40:36.390
That suit.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.393
And please understand,
I want to believe you.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.756
I... I'm sorry.

40:42.760 --> 40:43.637
<i>And yet I feel</i>

40:44.200 --> 40:47.398
you may have information
that may be useful.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.072
For instance,

40:56.080 --> 40:58.879
why would you regularly
open your legs

40:58.880 --> 41:01.395
for the Alderman
Stephen Bartlett,

41:01.400 --> 41:03.073
a fat man,

41:03.080 --> 41:04.514
far from handsome?

41:04.520 --> 41:09.072
Perhaps his... dagger
was more voluminous

41:09.080 --> 41:10.514
than average.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.280
Alderman Bartlett
and I--

41:13.280 --> 41:14.600
- Shh, shh, shh--
- No!

41:14.600 --> 41:16.432
Shh! It's all right.
It's all right,

41:16.440 --> 41:17.430
I know all.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.797
Don't be ashamed.
We all have secrets.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.354
Some are just dirtier
than others.

41:31.680 --> 41:32.875
For instance,

41:32.880 --> 41:36.191
I recently discovered
I am to father a child.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.190
Would you believe it?

41:39.600 --> 41:41.034
Congratulations, sir.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.635
Why, thank you.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.155
But your secrets,
Teresa darling,

41:46.160 --> 41:48.675
simply happen to be
more foul.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.636
To kill
Alderman Bartlett.

41:54.880 --> 41:58.237
No, I... I didn't kill
Mr. Bartlett.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.356
And his son!

41:59.360 --> 42:02.080
<i>No! I never met
his son. I...</i>

42:02.080 --> 42:05.198
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Lass, shh. Shh...

42:08.320 --> 42:09.436
Do you know why I felt
I could tell you

42:09.440 --> 42:10.635
that I am to father
a child?

42:10.640 --> 42:14.475
A secret I've shared
with no other

42:14.480 --> 42:17.996
until this very night,
hmm?

42:18.000 --> 42:19.150
No.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.880
Because I knew you would
not speak of it.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.554
Because sadly,

42:25.560 --> 42:27.677
you'll not have
the chance.

42:50.680 --> 42:52.034
Teresa!
