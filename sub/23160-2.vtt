WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.110
Hoist 'em!

00:03.187 --> 00:05.485
Or I'll give that funny shirt you're
wearing a couple of more colors.

00:05.556 --> 00:07.387
Quit playing games,
a girl is missing.

00:07.458 --> 00:08.755
I don't like working
with partners.

00:08.826 --> 00:10.350
Look what you're driving.

00:10.428 --> 00:11.895
How do you expect
to lose a tail...

00:11.963 --> 00:14.488
when you stick out like King
Kong on the Empire State Building?

00:18.002 --> 00:19.697
Jonathan Higgins, Robin's Nest.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.431
Luther Gillis, PI,
St. Louis.

00:21.505 --> 00:22.563
You, too?

00:22.840 --> 00:23.898
Nancy!

00:23.975 --> 00:26.466
Nancy! Nancy!
Wait a minute!

00:26.544 --> 00:27.806
Luther! Look out!

02:26.964 --> 02:28.556
<i>Thursday. 4:00 am.</i>

02:28.632 --> 02:31.795
<i>Too early to call it quits
and too late to try and flop.</i>

02:32.003 --> 02:35.564
<i>The arthritis was making my fingers
feel like leftover Jell-O...</i>

02:35.840 --> 02:39.936
<i>and the last 12 butts had turned
my mouth as dry as cotton candy.</i>

02:40.244 --> 02:43.907
<i>I knew it was time to move in
before I lost my appetite.</i>

02:44.215 --> 02:47.207
<i>Name's Gillis, Luther.
Hail from St. Louis.</i>

02:47.451 --> 02:50.443
<i>I usually don't take cases out
of town. But times are tough...</i>

02:50.521 --> 02:51.954
<i>not like after the war.</i>

02:52.023 --> 02:53.718
<i>Everyone was looking
for someone then.</i>

02:53.791 --> 02:55.816
<i>Even had a partner. Had.</i>

02:55.893 --> 03:00.193
<i>Chuckie bought it outside a dime-a-dance
joint in San Jose back in '63.</i>

03:00.431 --> 03:02.296
<i>I've been on my own ever since.</i>

03:13.811 --> 03:16.678
Talk to me, sweetheart.
Gary in?

03:21.719 --> 03:22.879
Thanks.

03:23.988 --> 03:27.116
Buy yourself a new dress.
You're gonna catch cold.

03:35.232 --> 03:37.996
<i>This caper I was
on was strictly routine.</i>

03:38.069 --> 03:40.537
<i>File number 521, I called it.</i>

03:40.771 --> 03:44.673
<i>Teenage girl ditches geography
and runs off to Honolulu.</i>

03:45.009 --> 03:48.103
<i>To my way of looking at it, she
didn't need the class anyway.</i>

03:48.446 --> 03:52.143
<i>Because any girl that can find her way
from East St. Louis to paradise...</i>

03:52.216 --> 03:54.377
<i>deserves an "A" in my book.</i>

03:54.685 --> 03:57.882
<i>The last anybody heard of little
Nancy Perkins was three months ago.</i>

03:57.955 --> 04:01.516
<i>I got it through the vine that she was
living with some crud named Gary...</i>

04:01.592 --> 04:04.686
<i>a nickel-and-dime dealer,
all-around sleaze-o.</i>

04:05.196 --> 04:08.996
<i>You know, I got the feeling I've been
on this case a hundred times before.</i>

04:09.400 --> 04:11.732
<i>Somehow nothing ever changes.</i>

04:12.103 --> 04:15.129
<i>In all my years at this dodge, I've
come across a whole lot of ways...</i>

04:15.206 --> 04:17.036
<i>to get into locked
hotel rooms...</i>

04:17.108 --> 04:19.632
<i>skeleton keys, lock picks,
credit cards.</i>

04:21.678 --> 04:24.409
<i>But I guess I'm just
an old-fashioned kind of guy.</i>

04:25.816 --> 04:27.044
Hoist 'em!

04:27.418 --> 04:28.783
You got it!

04:29.787 --> 04:31.379
About your decorator.

04:31.922 --> 04:33.184
Oh...

04:33.257 --> 04:34.918
I think you've got
the wrong idea here.

04:34.992 --> 04:36.254
Put a lid on it, Gary.

04:36.660 --> 04:37.786
Where's the bimbo?

04:37.862 --> 04:38.829
Gary?

04:38.896 --> 04:39.954
Bimbo?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.998
You're trying my patience.

04:42.066 --> 04:45.502
Come across with little Nancy or you'll be
reading the fine print on the Mann Act...

04:45.569 --> 04:48.003
under a 40-watt bulb
at Oahu Prison.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.173
Little Nancy?

04:51.242 --> 04:52.504
Nancy Perkins?

04:52.576 --> 04:55.272
Funny what the open end of
a.38 will do for the memory.

04:55.346 --> 04:56.745
Hoist 'em!

04:57.515 --> 04:58.709
Where is she, Gary?

04:58.782 --> 05:00.841
Oh, I get it.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.749
You think I'm Gary.
I'm not Gary.

05:02.820 --> 05:05.721
I think I can explain this if
you'll just put the gun away.

05:05.823 --> 05:07.017
Hoist 'em!

05:07.091 --> 05:09.787
Or I'll give that funny shirt you're
wearing a couple of more colors...

05:09.860 --> 05:10.952
like two shades of red.

05:11.529 --> 05:13.292
Look, I'm not Gary!

05:13.731 --> 05:16.427
I'm looking for Gary. I'm also
looking for little Nancy, and-

05:16.500 --> 05:18.331
All right, freeze!
You're under arrest!

05:24.975 --> 05:26.499
All right, what are you guys
doing here?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.303
Would you believe Parcheesi?

05:30.714 --> 05:31.772
No.

05:33.784 --> 05:35.979
Maybe I'd believe
a little grass.

05:36.287 --> 05:38.118
All right, you guys
are coming with us.

05:38.189 --> 05:40.749
Oh, wait, I think I can explain.

05:40.824 --> 05:43.292
See, I found that and I
was going to call you guys.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.418
Downtown, Gary.

05:44.495 --> 05:46.019
I'm not Gary!

05:55.072 --> 05:56.369
That's Gary.

06:00.211 --> 06:03.044
<i>Being a private investigator
is usually interesting work.</i>

06:03.113 --> 06:05.172
<i>You meet all kinds
of different people...</i>

06:05.249 --> 06:09.276
<i>and every once in a while, you get to
help out somebody who really needs a hand.</i>

06:09.353 --> 06:13.687
<i>Sometimes it's worth the occasional right
cross to the jaw or the cold night in jail.</i>

06:13.824 --> 06:18.659
<i>But sometimes you also wonder how long you
can do it before you have to grow up...</i>

06:18.796 --> 06:20.127
<i>and get a real job.</i>

06:20.197 --> 06:23.792
<i>Especially when you see the future
staring you right in the face.</i>

06:23.867 --> 06:25.732
So you're a private detective,
huh?

06:25.803 --> 06:26.895
Investigator.

06:26.971 --> 06:31.032
Investigator. Detective. Gumshoe.
Dick. Flatfoot. Who cares?

06:31.141 --> 06:33.439
We both work the same side
of the street...

06:33.510 --> 06:36.001
and evidently the same case.
Who hired you, Magnum?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.446
Nancy Perkins' mother.
Who hired you?

06:38.649 --> 06:40.344
The dad. Real cozy.

06:40.684 --> 06:44.120
Yeah, they're getting a divorce.
Looks like we're in the middle of a custody fight.

06:44.188 --> 06:47.487
Yeah, kind of like playing
basketball without a hoop.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.184
When did the mom hire you?

06:50.928 --> 06:52.623
Last week.
From where?

06:52.997 --> 06:54.055
St. Louis.

06:54.131 --> 06:55.257
Why did you ice Gary?

06:55.332 --> 06:58.358
What?
Come on, I didn't ice Gary.

06:58.869 --> 07:00.302
Just checking,
trying to trip you up.

07:00.371 --> 07:02.498
Rapid-fire delivery,
that's part of my style.

07:02.573 --> 07:04.165
Everybody's gotta have a style.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.366
Come on, Luther!

07:06.443 --> 07:08.570
Quit playing games,
a girl is missing.

07:08.646 --> 07:11.046
The guy she's staying with is
dead and I gotta find her...

07:11.115 --> 07:12.605
or she's gonna
end up the same way.

07:12.683 --> 07:13.843
One of us has.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.248
You got your client, I get mine.

07:15.319 --> 07:17.446
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

07:17.521 --> 07:21.116
I'm trying to get some
work done here on my book.

07:21.258 --> 07:23.692
So if you could just-
Stuff it, scrunge-o!

07:24.261 --> 07:26.092
Let me share something
with you, Magnum.

07:26.163 --> 07:29.724
I don't like wise guys and I
don't like working with partners.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.358
Who said anything
about partners?

07:31.435 --> 07:33.232
I've been working alone
too long, see?

07:33.337 --> 07:34.361
Fine.

07:34.438 --> 07:36.599
You try to find
Nancy Perkins your way...

07:36.674 --> 07:38.767
and I'll try to find her my way.

07:38.842 --> 07:42.278
And let's hope one of us gets to her
while she's still in one piece. Got it?

07:42.346 --> 07:43.540
Fine! I got it!

07:43.614 --> 07:46.879
Good. I'm glad we understand
each other. Now...

07:48.352 --> 07:49.876
how do we get out of this place?

07:53.657 --> 07:56.125
I just might be able
to arrange that.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.918
Yeah, right.
Connections in high places.

07:59.697 --> 08:01.961
Buddies with the local Kahuna.

08:04.168 --> 08:05.294
Better.

08:06.036 --> 08:07.367
You see, Luther...

08:07.438 --> 08:10.100
there are some advantages
to working with me.

08:10.674 --> 08:12.733
If I needed the help,
which I don't...

08:13.377 --> 08:15.607
because this is my town,
people know me.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.877
And I'm in fairly tight
with the local constabulary...

08:19.950 --> 08:21.815
which means
all I'd have to do...

08:22.619 --> 08:24.746
call my friend,
Lieutenant Tanaka.

08:25.055 --> 08:26.682
And he'd have us out of here...

08:28.125 --> 08:29.456
just like that.

08:29.893 --> 08:33.124
Sorry, Magnum, you two guys
aren't going anywhere.

08:33.664 --> 08:37.464
Wait a second. You and I are
going to the Islander game tonight.

08:37.534 --> 08:39.866
So, I'll take my grandson, Biff.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.336
But they're box seats.

08:41.405 --> 08:42.633
They're right behind home plate.

08:42.706 --> 08:44.537
Do you have any idea
what they cost me?

08:44.608 --> 08:45.575
Ooh, plenty.

08:46.744 --> 08:48.871
What do you know
about Gary Alexander?

08:48.946 --> 08:52.609
Just that he's living with a Nancy Perkins,
a runaway. I'm working for the mother.

08:52.683 --> 08:53.707
And you, Mr. Gillis?

08:53.784 --> 08:55.376
I'm working for the dad, okay?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.079
Sure it's okay with me.

08:57.154 --> 09:00.521
What do either of you know about the
late Mr. Alexander and his associates?

09:00.591 --> 09:01.751
Nothing.

09:01.992 --> 09:03.721
Just that he'd been dealing
some marijuana.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.319
Look, I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but
I can't tell you anything else.

09:06.397 --> 09:08.558
Sorry? Sorry?

09:08.632 --> 09:10.691
What are you apologizing for?
He's a cop.

09:10.768 --> 09:12.030
He's just doing his job.

09:12.102 --> 09:13.228
He's a cop!

09:14.738 --> 09:17.639
I don't know what kind of private
eyes they're making nowadays...

09:17.708 --> 09:19.369
but when you start
apologizing to cops...

09:19.443 --> 09:20.967
maybe it's time I packed it in.

09:21.044 --> 09:23.137
Look, Tanaka,
I gotta get out of here.

09:23.213 --> 09:24.305
I gotta get back to my hotel...

09:24.381 --> 09:27.441
take a shower and shave,
plus I got a case to solve.

09:27.518 --> 09:29.145
Go to your ballgame.

09:29.219 --> 09:31.653
You better tell your partner
to calm down, Magnum.

09:31.722 --> 09:33.383
He's not my partner.
Luther.

09:33.457 --> 09:35.049
I bet the next thing
you're gonna tell me is...

09:35.125 --> 09:37.525
I can't leave the island
'cause I'm a material witness.

09:37.594 --> 09:38.686
Magnum.
Luther.

09:38.762 --> 09:39.751
Mr. Gillis-

09:39.830 --> 09:42.162
Do you know how many coppers have
laid that line on me in my time?

09:42.232 --> 09:43.859
Look, buddy, I know the rules.

09:43.934 --> 09:47.370
Now give me the key to this
two-bit tank and let me out of here.

09:47.704 --> 09:49.467
I just threw it away.

09:54.978 --> 09:58.311
<i>The big guy sure had
a temper, I'll say that for him.</i>

09:58.415 --> 10:00.076
<i>What a way to spend a night...</i>

10:00.150 --> 10:03.278
<i>but he's gotta learn you can't
let cops push you around.</i>

10:03.387 --> 10:07.255
<i>And he even got madder when I got my
secretary to wire my bail for me.</i>

10:07.558 --> 10:10.425
<i>That Blanche,
she's a helluva kid.</i>

10:10.494 --> 10:12.359
<i>Been with me since '51.</i>

10:12.429 --> 10:14.226
<i>Funny how time creeps by.</i>

10:14.298 --> 10:15.890
Sun and Surf Motel.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.161
<i>Anyway, the bail got here before
Magnum's so-called friends did.</i>

10:20.471 --> 10:23.167
<i>Of course, that didn't make
him any happier about things.</i>

10:23.240 --> 10:25.606
<i>But, hey, I got a case to solve.</i>

10:27.511 --> 10:28.910
What kept you guys?

10:28.979 --> 10:30.139
Love.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.272
What do you mean, "love"?

10:31.348 --> 10:33.680
Six-love,
six-love, six-love.

10:33.750 --> 10:34.739
You got to rub it in?

10:34.818 --> 10:36.217
No, I guess I don't.

10:36.286 --> 10:39.653
Gee, that's just great, guys. I'm
sitting in jail on a murder charge...

10:39.723 --> 10:41.918
and you guys are out hitting
a little ball back and forth.

10:41.992 --> 10:44.722
I thought you were trying to
find out about Gary Alexander...

10:44.795 --> 10:46.592
but you're just out
having a good time. Thanks.

10:46.663 --> 10:48.358
Thanks a lot.
Hey, Thomas...

10:48.432 --> 10:50.161
we weren't out playing
tennis with ourselves.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.667
We were out playing
with Ice Pick.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.703
Yeah, and his bodyguard, Hugo.

10:53.770 --> 10:56.068
Hugo?
Yeah. Doubles.

10:56.373 --> 10:58.864
And the only way to get any
information out of him was by losing.

10:58.942 --> 11:00.341
Six-love.

11:00.511 --> 11:02.376
Do you think it's easy losing
to an 80-pound shrimp?

11:02.446 --> 11:04.778
And his 400-pound
bodyguard?

11:04.848 --> 11:06.645
Do you realize how many
tennis balls he broke?

11:06.717 --> 11:07.911
Not to mention rackets.

11:07.985 --> 11:08.952
Hugo?

11:09.019 --> 11:10.748
Look, Thomas,
we don't have all day.

11:10.821 --> 11:12.721
I mean, our pride and our
self-respect have been shattered.

11:12.789 --> 11:14.279
Do you want the information
or not?

11:14.358 --> 11:15.484
Yeah.
Wait a minute, guys.

11:15.559 --> 11:18.653
Come on, come on, T.C.,
I'm sorry. Sorry, Rick.

11:18.729 --> 11:20.026
What did you find out?

11:20.097 --> 11:23.794
Well, we found out that Gary was
into Artie Keanu for mucho bucks.

11:23.867 --> 11:27.132
Now, he ripped him off on a couple
of deals, skimmed right off the top.

11:27.204 --> 11:30.901
You find Artie Keanu, you
find who killed Gary Alexander.

11:30.974 --> 11:32.464
And maybe the missing chick.

11:32.543 --> 11:33.669
Well, thanks, guys.

11:33.744 --> 11:35.405
Look, can you drop me
off at the estate?

11:35.479 --> 11:37.640
First, we've got
one stop to make.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.681
Ice Pick wants to see you.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.876
So does Hugo.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.078
Sorry, pal.
Part of the deal.

11:50.193 --> 11:52.889
<i>After five tiebreakers
with Ice Pick and Hugo...</i>

11:52.963 --> 11:55.397
<i>I finally went
to see Artie Keanu.</i>

11:55.465 --> 11:59.561
<i>Now, when I write my book on how to be
a world class private investigator...</i>

11:59.770 --> 12:03.797
<i>I'm going to include a chapter about
getting in touch with local crime bosses.</i>

12:05.208 --> 12:06.800
<i>Paragraph one...</i>

12:06.877 --> 12:08.435
<i>it's not easy.</i>

12:08.512 --> 12:11.743
<i>That's because guys like Artie
Keanu tend to run everything...</i>

12:11.815 --> 12:14.340
<i>through subordinates,
guys like Gary.</i>

12:14.418 --> 12:16.409
<i>Gary was no longer with him.</i>

12:16.753 --> 12:18.380
<i>Instead,
I got a guy on the phone...</i>

12:18.455 --> 12:19.615
<i>with gravel for a voice...</i>

12:19.690 --> 12:21.351
<i>telling me to get lost.</i>

12:21.425 --> 12:23.120
<i>Not polite at all.</i>

12:26.330 --> 12:27.661
<i>Paragraph two...</i>

12:27.731 --> 12:31.223
<i>if phone calls don't work,
try a personal visit.</i>

12:31.301 --> 12:33.098
<i>Sure, it was dangerous...</i>

12:33.170 --> 12:35.263
<i>but I figured
once I got to Artie himself...</i>

12:35.339 --> 12:37.671
<i>he'd understand and help
me find little Nancy.</i>

12:37.908 --> 12:41.344
<i>I'd appeal to his sense
of compassion and humanity...</i>

12:41.411 --> 12:43.845
<i>and I'd also put
a. 45 to his head.</i>

12:49.786 --> 12:51.253
<i>Paragraph three...</i>

12:51.555 --> 12:55.355
<i>what you have to be careful about are
ignoring the guys with the gravely voices...</i>

12:55.425 --> 12:59.794
<i>because they're the type of yo-yos who tend
to shoot first and ask questions later.</i>

13:37.401 --> 13:38.629
Rookies.

13:49.394 --> 13:51.521
<i>I took the big
guy to an emergency room...</i>

13:51.596 --> 13:54.156
<i>and got that thick skull
of his patched up.</i>

13:54.232 --> 13:55.460
<i>The outside.</i>

13:55.800 --> 13:57.768
<i>The inside was another matter.</i>

13:57.836 --> 14:00.532
What's the matter with you? You
could've got the both of us killed.

14:00.605 --> 14:02.903
Quit the yelling.
I'm not yelling.

14:04.475 --> 14:05.908
Where is your place?

14:06.344 --> 14:07.641
Straight ahead.

14:07.712 --> 14:10.613
Listen, bub, you better stick
to your surfboards and suntans...

14:10.682 --> 14:11.706
and stay out of my way!

14:11.783 --> 14:12.943
Luther, my head-

14:13.017 --> 14:14.348
Is filled with air!

14:14.419 --> 14:15.408
Air!

14:15.486 --> 14:17.954
Do you realize what a dumb
mistake you made back there?

14:18.022 --> 14:19.489
Running blind into that place.

14:19.557 --> 14:21.923
I can't believe you!

14:22.093 --> 14:24.288
Right here. Look at that.

14:24.362 --> 14:25.727
Chapter six...

14:26.264 --> 14:27.663
Working The Waterfront.

14:27.732 --> 14:28.699
What's this?

14:28.766 --> 14:31.257
What's this? What's this?
It's my book!

14:31.336 --> 14:33.031
Stop yelling. Please.

14:36.241 --> 14:39.608
<i>So You Want To Be A
Private Eye?</i> by Luther H. Gillis.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.149
What's so funny?

14:47.919 --> 14:49.079
Nothing.

14:49.754 --> 14:53.190
Nothing.
You wouldn't understand.

14:57.328 --> 14:58.590
Here we are.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.530
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it was
me that got hit in the head.

15:40.738 --> 15:43.036
No, I see it, too.

15:44.575 --> 15:47.203
I say, Magnum,
you look like bloody hell.

15:47.278 --> 15:48.768
Beaten up again, I imagine.

15:48.846 --> 15:50.336
No, I wasn't beaten up.

15:50.415 --> 15:51.541
He was shot.

15:51.616 --> 15:54.244
Oh, Mr. Magnum,
are you all right?

15:54.686 --> 15:56.483
I'm fine, Agatha, I'm fine.

15:56.554 --> 15:58.283
The bullet just
creased my forehead.

15:58.356 --> 16:00.881
It's just a flesh wound.
It's just a flesh wound.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.828
Well, perhaps if you enrolled
in Jonathan's kung fu class...

16:05.897 --> 16:08.764
you might be better
able to defend yourself.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.232
Right, girls?

16:11.436 --> 16:13.233
Against bullets?

16:14.138 --> 16:15.628
Who shot you, Magnum?

16:15.707 --> 16:18.699
Another philandering husband on
yet another tawdry divorce case?

16:18.776 --> 16:20.767
Or was it-
Hey, wait a second, bub.

16:20.845 --> 16:23.405
What's so tawdry
about a divorce case?

16:23.781 --> 16:25.009
I beg your pardon?

16:25.083 --> 16:28.541
You heard me. I said what's
tawdry about a divorce case?

16:28.653 --> 16:30.143
Guy's gotta make a buck.

16:30.221 --> 16:31.313
Peeping in keyholes...

16:31.389 --> 16:33.880
and hanging upside down on fire
escapes gawking through windows...

16:33.958 --> 16:36.449
hardly qualifies as
dignified labor to me.

16:39.364 --> 16:41.832
I'm afraid, sir,
we've not been introduced.

16:42.867 --> 16:44.698
Jonathan Higgins, Robin's Nest.

16:44.769 --> 16:47.169
Luther Gillis, PI,
St. Louis.

16:47.238 --> 16:49.399
PI? You too?

16:49.774 --> 16:51.401
You got it, Bruce Lee.

16:54.946 --> 16:56.311
Luther and I...

16:56.381 --> 16:59.407
we're sort of on the same
case, but we're not really.

16:59.484 --> 17:00.849
How droll. A team.

17:00.918 --> 17:02.510
No. We're not a team.

17:02.754 --> 17:03.778
Of course.

17:03.855 --> 17:06.289
By the by,
Rick's been looking for you.

17:06.357 --> 17:08.916
He says he's had
a break in the case.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.152
Great.

17:12.497 --> 17:14.021
Oh, Magnum...

17:17.568 --> 17:21.163
I was going to ask you to stand in while
the ladies demonstrate their jump kick.

17:21.939 --> 17:24.499
But inasmuch as
you are indisposed...

17:24.942 --> 17:27.342
may I prevail upon
Mr. Gillis?

17:27.744 --> 17:29.770
What's the matter
with you standing in?

17:29.847 --> 17:33.214
I have to observe the ladies' form
before moving on to the next lesson.

17:33.684 --> 17:37.176
Just, stay right where
you are, Mr. Gillis.

17:40.091 --> 17:41.319
Gladys.

17:46.297 --> 17:48.458
My God!

17:59.510 --> 18:02.479
Look. Look, I'm sorry, okay?

18:03.214 --> 18:05.682
I thought that old broad was
trying to kick my dentures in.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.217
Get out of my life, Luther.

18:07.285 --> 18:08.513
I'm out.

18:08.586 --> 18:12.022
I just wanna find out what your
friend has to say about Nancy Perkins.

18:12.323 --> 18:13.915
<i>Hello, Magnum.</i>

18:13.991 --> 18:17.586
<i>I see that you have finally succumbed
to the realities of modern living.</i>

18:17.695 --> 18:19.720
<i>Perhaps now your clients
will be able to reach you...</i>

18:19.797 --> 18:22.357
<i>without calling on
Mr. Masters' private line.</i>

18:22.500 --> 18:26.163
<i>On the other hand, so will the
inevitable parade of bill collectors.</i>

18:26.270 --> 18:29.364
<i>I shudder to think what you'll
be spending on audio tape.</i>

18:29.640 --> 18:32.200
<i>At any rate, what I'm calling
about is the lads.</i>

18:32.276 --> 18:33.903
<i>I've been promising
to take them to the...</i>

18:33.978 --> 18:36.640
<i>Anglo-Hawaiian Canine
Convention, this Sunday and-</i>

18:41.018 --> 18:44.044
<i>Hello,
Thomas. This is Sheryl.</i>

18:44.122 --> 18:45.419
<i>You remember me?</i>

18:46.657 --> 18:48.818
<i>Thielburg Insurance.</i>

18:49.060 --> 18:50.960
<i>Anyway, if you're out of work...</i>

18:51.028 --> 18:53.428
<i>we have this insurance claim
we need a report on-</i>

18:54.565 --> 18:56.999
Insurance dogging,
Mr. Big Time?

18:57.502 --> 18:58.491
Sideline.

18:59.303 --> 19:01.134
<i>Hey, Thomas, where you been?</i>

19:01.205 --> 19:03.196
<i>I got some new skinny
on Artie Keanu.</i>

19:03.274 --> 19:05.265
<i>Hey, where did you
get this machine?</i>

19:05.343 --> 19:08.904
<i>You didn't take this out of my
office, did you? No, it's still here.</i>

19:08.980 --> 19:11.778
<i>Anyway, I found out Keanu personally
runs a weekly cockfight...</i>

19:11.849 --> 19:15.046
<i>over on Old Awamoku Road
on the other side of the Pali.</i>

19:15.119 --> 19:16.381
<i>Ho-ho, big money, too.</i>

19:16.454 --> 19:18.854
<i>Lots of action. Just one
thing, though, pally...</i>

19:18.923 --> 19:21.915
<i>you go up there, you better make
sure your insurance is paid up...</i>

19:21.993 --> 19:24.223
<i>and your bar tab.</i>

19:24.896 --> 19:25.954
See you, bub.

19:26.030 --> 19:28.498
Hey, just a second, Luther.
Where do you think you're going?

19:28.566 --> 19:30.898
You heard the guy, Owomaku Road.

19:30.968 --> 19:32.902
You don't know where
"Awamoku Road" is.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.335
You don't even know
how to say it.

19:34.405 --> 19:37.033
I'll find it. They haven't
made a place I can't find.

19:37.108 --> 19:39.099
Great. You find it, you're
going to get yourself killed.

19:39.177 --> 19:42.044
Who's talking? I'm not the one
who's bouncing bullets off his head.

19:42.113 --> 19:43.740
Besides, this is my case.

19:43.814 --> 19:45.714
It's my case
and I'm going up there.

19:45.783 --> 19:46.807
So am I!

19:46.884 --> 19:49.182
You got a concussion.
You can't even see!

19:49.253 --> 19:51.084
You're staying right here.
No!

19:51.155 --> 19:52.713
I know what you're thinking,
Magnum.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.758
You're thinking that
I'm old, washed-up...

19:54.825 --> 19:56.349
through, some kind of relic.
- Luther.

19:56.427 --> 19:58.861
A dinosaur or something. Well,
I'll tell you something, bud...

19:58.930 --> 20:01.922
I was bringing back runaways and
standing up before big guys...

20:01.999 --> 20:03.762
before you were born.
Before I was born!

20:08.839 --> 20:10.033
Luther...

20:11.142 --> 20:12.507
all I'm saying...

20:12.843 --> 20:14.640
is it doesn't get any easier.

20:14.712 --> 20:18.204
And Artie Keanu is a tough guy
to go up against alone.

20:18.883 --> 20:20.817
Look, can you get me a couple
of aspirin, will you?

20:20.885 --> 20:22.079
My head, please.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.280
Sure, big guy.
Where are they?

20:24.355 --> 20:26.118
In the cupboard, above the sink.

20:28.226 --> 20:29.659
You just stay right there.

20:31.028 --> 20:33.155
I'll handle this
Artie Canoe guy.

20:33.798 --> 20:35.288
It's "Keanu."

20:35.399 --> 20:37.094
And besides, assuming...

20:38.703 --> 20:41.001
assuming you find the fight...

20:41.172 --> 20:42.434
I mean, how are you
going to play it?

20:42.506 --> 20:43.666
Thanks.

20:43.741 --> 20:44.730
I mean...

20:48.179 --> 20:52.479
Artie is going to have more muscle around
him than the Raiders' offensive line.

20:52.883 --> 20:55.283
Let's just say I still got
a few tricks up my sleeve.

20:55.353 --> 20:56.342
Like what?

20:58.856 --> 21:00.346
Like Chloral Hydrate.

21:01.259 --> 21:02.521
Chapter nine.

21:02.927 --> 21:05.225
You never know when you'll
need a mickey, Magnum.

21:08.366 --> 21:10.197
You see,
you just don't understand.

21:10.901 --> 21:13.062
Luther Gillis works alone.

21:36.294 --> 21:37.659
I'm sorry, okay?

21:47.038 --> 21:49.506
<i>I kind of felt
bad about doping the big guy.</i>

21:49.573 --> 21:53.304
<i>After all, he meant well, but a lug
like that's just gonna get in the way.</i>

21:53.377 --> 21:56.107
<i>At any rate, it bought me some
time to get to the hotel...</i>

21:56.180 --> 21:58.740
<i>and get in some local
undercover type duds.</i>

21:58.816 --> 22:02.377
<i>Plenty of time, because I knew Magnum
was going to be seeing more stars...</i>

22:02.453 --> 22:04.080
<i>in the next few hours
than there were in...</i>

22:04.155 --> 22:07.147
<i>Schwab's Drugstore circa 1953.</i>

22:12.997 --> 22:15.261
<i>I never could
figure out how come people...</i>

22:15.333 --> 22:18.325
<i>like seeing little birdies with
razorblades on their toes...</i>

22:18.402 --> 22:20.199
<i>slashing each other to ribbons.</i>

22:20.271 --> 22:23.729
<i>I mean, those poor slobs should be
sitting on top of a henhouse...</i>

22:23.808 --> 22:26.402
<i>crowing the break of day,
enjoying life.</i>

22:27.912 --> 22:32.315
<i>Of course, I never could figure out wars
or boxing or the roller derby either.</i>

22:32.383 --> 22:34.715
<i>I just go along
and do the best I can.</i>

22:35.152 --> 22:37.746
<i>Which includes putting it on
the line every once in a while.</i>

22:37.822 --> 22:39.722
<i>Especially when it's worth it.</i>

22:39.824 --> 22:43.123
<i>And I was hoping that
little Nancy Perkins was.</i>

22:45.529 --> 22:48.589
Hey, big boy. I'm looking to lay one
on the fight tonight. Where's Artie?

22:48.666 --> 22:50.725
Just lay it on me, brother.
I'll see he gets it.

22:50.801 --> 22:51.995
Not good enough.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.395
I only give it to Artie.
Nothing personal...

22:54.472 --> 22:56.201
just that I don't know you.

22:56.273 --> 22:58.639
They call me Little Tony.
Now you know me.

22:58.709 --> 23:00.336
They call me Luther Gillis.

23:00.411 --> 23:04.108
Now do you want to tell Artie he's
not welcome in Vegas anymore, or do I?

23:04.849 --> 23:07.079
This is Luther Gillis
you're talking to.

23:07.184 --> 23:09.914
You understand?
Luther H. Gillis from Vegas.

23:09.987 --> 23:11.852
Now do you tell me
where my friend Artie is...

23:11.922 --> 23:14.789
or do I rip your heart out
through your lungs?

23:14.992 --> 23:16.220
In the office.

23:17.495 --> 23:18.484
Thanks.

23:19.029 --> 23:20.656
You're a sweetheart.

23:22.666 --> 23:24.156
<i>Little Tony didn't know it...</i>

23:24.235 --> 23:27.329
<i>but I was seriously considering
getting into a new line of work...</i>

23:27.438 --> 23:29.338
<i>like astronomy or something.</i>

23:29.707 --> 23:32.301
<i>I mean, none of this
is getting any easier.</i>

23:32.376 --> 23:34.367
<i>So while I still had the nerve
I thought I'd try...</i>

23:34.445 --> 23:36.504
<i>the direct approach
with Artie Canoe.</i>

23:39.083 --> 23:41.881
Where is she? Nancy Perkins?
16, strawberry blonde.

23:41.952 --> 23:43.317
Lived with that crud you iced.

23:43.387 --> 23:45.685
I didn't ice him. I don't
give a damn about him.

23:45.756 --> 23:47.951
Where's the girl, Artie?
I don't know.

23:48.025 --> 23:50.755
Now you better.
- I better what, huh? I better what?

23:50.828 --> 23:52.557
In three seconds, I'm
gonna pull this trigger...

23:52.630 --> 23:54.791
and your guts are gonna go
splashing across this room.

23:54.865 --> 23:56.389
Now, talk to me, Artie!

23:56.467 --> 23:58.332
Three! Two!

23:58.436 --> 24:00.063
Sister Rose.
What?

24:00.137 --> 24:01.934
Try Sister Rose, Hotel Street.

24:02.506 --> 24:04.804
Look, I don't know where the
little girl is either, man.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.638
And she's damn lucky about that.

24:06.844 --> 24:08.903
But if anybody would know,
it'd be Sister Rose.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.708
Thanks.

24:10.948 --> 24:15.851
Besides being illegal, hasn't anybody ever
told you that cockfighting isn't nice?

24:16.153 --> 24:17.950
Be kind to animals, Artie.

24:18.255 --> 24:20.416
They're supposed to be
dumber than we are.

24:20.491 --> 24:23.654
My thought for the day.
See you.

24:23.727 --> 24:26.821
I kind of thought that was a long
time to be putting down a bet.

24:26.897 --> 24:28.455
Back inside, Mr. Vegas.

24:28.532 --> 24:29.931
Hi, guys.

24:35.739 --> 24:38.936
Now, let's discuss this
situation for a minute. You see...

24:39.443 --> 24:43.243
Artie, if you guys decide to do
anything funny, here's what happens.

24:43.314 --> 24:47.478
Luther shoots you, the big guy shoots
Luther, and I shoot the big guy.

24:47.852 --> 24:51.049
Which means, you two guys wind
up dead and all I lose is Luther.

24:51.622 --> 24:54.955
Which at this point, begins to
sound more and more acceptable.

24:55.593 --> 24:57.754
Now, there is an alternative.

24:58.395 --> 25:02.957
You can let us both go and we
promise not to bother you anymore.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.703
I guess we're even now.

25:14.578 --> 25:16.068
Now we're even.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.970
You're learning, big guy.

25:20.417 --> 25:22.078
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.979
You got us out of a tough one.

25:25.556 --> 25:27.285
We're home free now.

25:38.369 --> 25:39.961
<i>This is the police.
Don't anybody move.</i>

25:40.037 --> 25:41.800
<i>We have this entire
place surrounded.</i>

25:53.999 --> 25:57.366
Guard! Guard! Get me out of
here! I want a separate cell.

25:57.436 --> 25:59.028
I want a separate prison!

25:59.104 --> 26:00.366
I'm through with you!
Through!

26:00.439 --> 26:01.428
Likewise!

26:01.506 --> 26:03.531
I should practice what I preach.

26:03.609 --> 26:06.578
Never work with a partner who is
less capable than you. Chapter five.

26:06.645 --> 26:08.579
I'm not working with you,
Luther!

26:08.647 --> 26:10.740
I know that! That's because
you don't listen.

26:10.816 --> 26:12.943
No! No, it's...

26:13.151 --> 26:15.711
it's you who won't listen!
I told you not to go there.

26:15.787 --> 26:17.812
Yeah? Who got the name
Sister Rose?

26:17.889 --> 26:19.584
Sister Rose.
Yeah, who is she?

26:19.658 --> 26:21.250
Nobody. It won't mean
anything to you.

26:25.097 --> 26:27.122
Withholding information!
That isn't fair!

26:27.232 --> 26:29.496
Yeah? I suppose
slipping me a mickey was?

26:29.568 --> 26:31.433
Hey, it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

26:42.648 --> 26:45.310
You two are menaces.
Walking menaces.

26:45.384 --> 26:48.842
First, murder. Then mayhem.
Now an attempted suicide.

26:48.987 --> 26:50.921
Trouble is my business.

26:51.056 --> 26:52.489
Luther.

26:52.557 --> 26:54.821
Putting people
behind bars is mine.

26:54.893 --> 26:57.259
You've got nothing on us.
You gotta let us make bail.

26:57.329 --> 26:59.320
Oh, come on, Luther,
please, not again.

26:59.398 --> 27:02.196
Don't worry.
I'm going to let you go.

27:02.267 --> 27:03.928
First, three questions...

27:04.269 --> 27:07.761
you've got anything new to tell me
about the murder of Gary Alexander?

27:08.040 --> 27:09.974
Is Artie Keanu mixed up in it?

27:10.208 --> 27:12.472
And where does this
runaway kid fit in?

27:12.544 --> 27:14.876
No. Maybe.
And we don't know.

27:15.480 --> 27:18.643
The two of you got 24 hours
to come up with the answers...

27:18.717 --> 27:21.208
or I'm going to run you
both in on the murder rap.

27:21.286 --> 27:22.753
That's ridiculous, Lieutenant.

27:22.821 --> 27:24.118
It won't stick!
It won't stick!

27:24.189 --> 27:27.488
Maybe. The DA's on
my butt to make an arrest...

27:27.559 --> 27:31.017
and since the two of you were in the
apartment when the body was found...

27:31.163 --> 27:33.893
I think I have a couple
of likely candidates for him.

27:33.965 --> 27:35.865
Come on, Lieutenant,
it won't stick.

27:35.934 --> 27:37.492
How do I know that?

27:37.569 --> 27:40.629
It's strange how the wheels
of justice sometimes turn.

27:41.206 --> 27:43.367
But I suppose
if there's a mistake...

27:43.642 --> 27:45.576
I can always redo the paperwork.

27:47.045 --> 27:48.706
See you guys.

27:49.448 --> 27:50.915
Wait a second.

27:51.183 --> 27:53.083
Why 24 hours?
That's-

27:53.151 --> 27:54.778
That's when we lose the room.

27:54.853 --> 27:57.344
We searched it,
sealed it and found nothing.

27:57.422 --> 27:59.356
So we've got to turn
it back to the hotel.

27:59.858 --> 28:02.326
<i>Aloha,</i> gentlemen.

28:02.394 --> 28:04.794
Yeah, <i>aloha</i> yourself.

28:09.568 --> 28:12.298
Hey, Magnum, you
see the sports page today?

28:13.138 --> 28:16.665
Tigers back into first place.
They got rained out.

28:16.908 --> 28:18.603
But Baltimore lost.

28:19.711 --> 28:22.475
Looks like a real
big year for comebacks.

28:31.256 --> 28:32.723
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

28:32.791 --> 28:35.157
<i>24 hours doesn't seem
like a whole lot of time...</i>

28:35.227 --> 28:37.718
<i>to find a missing teenage girl
and solve a murder.</i>

28:38.296 --> 28:40.196
<i>But having to do it
with Luther Gillis...</i>

28:40.265 --> 28:42.358
<i>can make it seem
like an eternity.</i>

28:48.039 --> 28:50.269
<i>Of course, I've
been in tighter spots before.</i>

28:50.342 --> 28:51.866
<i>Like the time
Eddie "The Wimp" Korcek...</i>

28:51.943 --> 28:54.104
<i>was pouring cement
over my wingtips.</i>

28:54.179 --> 28:57.205
<i>But never, ever have I had
a handicap like this guy.</i>

28:57.282 --> 29:00.581
<i>I mean, criminy, the dope doesn't
even know we're pulling a tail.</i>

29:03.722 --> 29:05.314
We got a tail, Luther.

29:06.191 --> 29:07.249
Don't look!

29:07.325 --> 29:09.759
I already spotted him
nine palm trees ago.

29:09.828 --> 29:10.817
Sure.

29:14.699 --> 29:15.893
Yellow Caddie.

29:17.702 --> 29:19.226
Don't look so surprised.

29:19.704 --> 29:21.365
Look what you're driving.

29:21.439 --> 29:23.270
How do you expect
to lose a tail...

29:23.341 --> 29:26.208
when you stick out like King
Kong on the Empire State Building?

29:26.278 --> 29:27.643
Like this.

29:30.882 --> 29:32.543
Oh, my God!

29:37.189 --> 29:38.554
Watch it!

30:08.186 --> 30:10.746
My old Nash
never did things like this.

30:21.132 --> 30:23.259
Lot of good your
racecar's doing us here.

30:24.202 --> 30:27.035
You know, some guys
are never satisfied.

30:27.105 --> 30:28.504
Didn't I just shake that tail?

30:28.573 --> 30:30.200
So, big deal.

30:30.275 --> 30:32.072
Probably your copper friend
keeping an eye on us.

30:32.143 --> 30:33.974
I don't think so.
It's not Tanaka's style.

30:34.045 --> 30:35.706
He don't have any style.

30:37.082 --> 30:39.107
My guess is it's Artie Keanu.

30:39.184 --> 30:42.779
I got a hunch that he wants little
Nancy Perkins as much as we do.

30:49.094 --> 30:50.527
Look at this place.

30:50.595 --> 30:51.960
Some paradise.

30:52.030 --> 30:54.396
I could've seen
this stuff in St. Louis.

30:54.466 --> 30:55.865
Nobody's stopping you.

30:55.934 --> 30:57.731
What?
What did you say?

30:57.802 --> 31:00.771
Luther, paradise isn't a place.

31:00.839 --> 31:03.433
It's a state of mind, you know?

31:03.508 --> 31:04.998
It's a feeling
you get when-

31:05.076 --> 31:06.202
Oh, just gimme a break,
will you?

31:06.278 --> 31:08.872
I don't want to get sick in
front of all these nice people.

31:09.714 --> 31:12.649
Now who's this Sister Rose
broad and where's her cathouse?

31:12.717 --> 31:13.741
It's right up here.

31:13.818 --> 31:15.979
She's probably some fat old
broad in a cheap black dress...

31:16.054 --> 31:18.022
with a bunch
of two-bit chicks.

31:18.089 --> 31:20.080
Come on, come on,
what's the password?

31:22.294 --> 31:24.660
The password is God, gentlemen.

31:24.729 --> 31:26.424
How may I be of service?

31:27.766 --> 31:29.199
You're Sister Rose?

31:29.301 --> 31:31.064
Sister Mary Magdalene Rose-

31:31.136 --> 31:33.934
Ah, excuse me, Sister.
I'm Luther Gillis.

31:34.005 --> 31:36.098
This is my partner, Tom Magnum.

31:36.174 --> 31:37.300
How do you do?

31:37.375 --> 31:39.138
We're private investigators.

31:39.210 --> 31:41.576
We're looking for a runaway
girl from St. Louis.

31:44.883 --> 31:46.748
She's very pretty.

31:46.885 --> 31:50.184
She's only 16,
Sister. Her name's Nancy Perkins.

31:51.156 --> 31:52.919
I'm afraid I can't help you.

31:52.991 --> 31:54.288
You haven't seen her?

31:54.859 --> 31:57.794
My mission down here in this
district is to offer shelter...

31:57.862 --> 32:00.524
and guidance to those
young ladies who seek it.

32:00.598 --> 32:02.088
I ask no questions.

32:02.167 --> 32:05.159
I'm just here,
someone they can trust.

32:05.804 --> 32:07.635
When they feel that
they're once again ready...

32:07.706 --> 32:09.936
for the outside world, well...

32:10.241 --> 32:13.210
I'm sorry,
Mr. Gillis, Mr. Magnum.

32:13.712 --> 32:15.839
Right now I can't help you.

32:15.914 --> 32:17.677
Yeah, sure.
Well, what if I-

32:17.749 --> 32:20.274
I'll pray for her, Mr. Gillis.
I promise.

32:21.486 --> 32:22.680
Thanks.

32:24.422 --> 32:27.619
But perhaps you two
gentlemen can help me.

32:30.662 --> 32:32.527
A small offering?

32:41.506 --> 32:43.804
<i>It wasn't the
$10 that was bothering me.</i>

32:43.875 --> 32:46.639
<i>It was something else.
A little voice.</i>

32:46.711 --> 32:49.373
<i>It was telling me that nuns
aren't supposed to lie.</i>

32:49.447 --> 32:51.244
<i>It's in their rulebook
or something.</i>

32:51.316 --> 32:54.217
<i>And, when you seriously analyze
it, Sister Rose didn't lie to us.</i>

32:54.285 --> 32:56.845
<i>She just said
she couldn't help us...</i>

32:56.921 --> 32:59.048
<i>and that she'd pray for Nancy.</i>

32:59.124 --> 33:01.319
<i>Didn't say anything
about not seeing her.</i>

33:01.860 --> 33:03.919
<i>I remember once
when I was nine years old...</i>

33:03.995 --> 33:07.761
<i>and I was in Catechism with my former
best friend, Eddie "The Wimp" Korcek...</i>

33:07.999 --> 33:11.093
<i>and our teacher was
Sister Mary Alice Meanface.</i>

33:11.169 --> 33:13.433
<i>She was always after Eddie
for pulling stunts...</i>

33:13.505 --> 33:15.063
<i>but could never catch him.</i>

33:15.140 --> 33:17.665
<i>So she did the next best thing
by busting my knuckles...</i>

33:17.742 --> 33:19.573
<i>with her steel-plated ruler.</i>

33:19.644 --> 33:22.636
<i>I'll never forget the look on
her face when I didn't squeal.</i>

33:22.714 --> 33:23.840
<i>It was scared...</i>

33:23.915 --> 33:27.510
<i>like a am-I-doing-the-right-thing
kind of look.</i>

33:28.053 --> 33:31.318
<i>Just like the look I saw five
minutes ago on that nun's face.</i>

33:35.393 --> 33:36.826
Nancy?

33:38.063 --> 33:40.258
Nancy! Come
on! Open up in there!

33:40.331 --> 33:41.889
Nancy! Nancy, you in there?

33:43.101 --> 33:44.568
Come on! Come on!
Open up again!

33:44.636 --> 33:46.536
You stay on her!
I'm gonna go around back.

33:48.406 --> 33:49.668
Come on, open up!

33:53.411 --> 33:57.006
Nancy! No, Nancy!
It's okay!

33:58.450 --> 34:01.442
Nancy! Nancy!
Wait a minute!

34:04.289 --> 34:05.517
Luther!

34:07.092 --> 34:08.889
Luther! Look out!

34:13.465 --> 34:14.762
Luther!

34:15.300 --> 34:16.665
Luther, you all right?

34:16.734 --> 34:19.202
Yeah, yeah, of course.

34:19.904 --> 34:21.201
Just help me up.

34:24.509 --> 34:26.841
What's the matter with you?
Did she get away?

34:27.312 --> 34:28.677
Yeah.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.947
You know, Luther, you almost
killed yourself just now.

34:32.217 --> 34:34.617
Somehow I don't think running
into oncoming traffic...

34:34.686 --> 34:37.246
after a runaway qualifies
as a chapter in your book.

34:37.322 --> 34:39.516
Except maybe
if she's your daughter.

34:39.991 --> 34:42.221
Then maybe you might
just run through hell.

34:48.831 --> 34:50.766
<i>I took Luther
to an emergency room...</i>

34:50.833 --> 34:52.301
<i>and had his head patched up.</i>

34:52.369 --> 34:53.495
<i>The outside.</i>

34:53.570 --> 34:55.800
<i>The inside, of course,
was another matter.</i>

34:55.871 --> 34:59.501
Chuckie! Look out! That
one's got your name on it!

35:00.577 --> 35:01.771
Look out.

35:01.845 --> 35:02.834
Oh!

35:03.413 --> 35:05.176
Oh, poor Chuckie.

35:06.216 --> 35:08.047
<i>Luther was
obviously in no condition...</i>

35:08.118 --> 35:10.279
<i>to answer a couple
of routine questions.</i>

35:10.353 --> 35:13.516
<i>Like, how come he didn't tell me
Nancy Perkins was his daughter?</i>

35:13.590 --> 35:16.991
<i>And given that, how come
he hired himself to find her?</i>

35:18.228 --> 35:21.197
I'm gonna marry you, Blanche.
I promise.

35:22.032 --> 35:25.559
St. Luke's, 10:00,
I'll be there.

35:27.070 --> 35:28.298
<i>Time was running out.</i>

35:28.371 --> 35:30.362
<i>Tanaka was going to run us
in on the murder rap...</i>

35:30.440 --> 35:33.967
<i>and I had the feeling that time was
running out on little Nancy Perkins, too.</i>

35:34.044 --> 35:35.944
<i>Or whatever her name was.</i>

35:36.012 --> 35:39.914
<i>Therefore, I had to stash Luther
someplace safe and go this alone.</i>

35:39.983 --> 35:43.384
<i>And I knew, given the circumstances,
that Higgins would understand.</i>

35:43.453 --> 35:44.750
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

35:44.821 --> 35:47.517
And how dare you bring back
this slovenly, sadistic bully?

35:47.591 --> 35:49.354
How dare you?
Because he needs help!

35:49.426 --> 35:50.950
Obviously so do you.

35:51.027 --> 35:53.018
By the way, your matching
bandages are quite the thing.

35:53.096 --> 35:54.586
You do make
such a debonair pair.

35:54.664 --> 35:57.030
Woody Herman's at the Palace.
You want to go cut a rug, Blanche?

35:57.300 --> 36:00.235
Oh, my. Oh, come on,
Higgins, just for a few hours.

36:00.303 --> 36:01.998
Look, he's not even
in his right mind.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.300
And obviously neither are you...

36:03.373 --> 36:05.807
if you think for one moment that.
- Just let me explain!

36:05.875 --> 36:08.935
See, look, that runaway girl we're after
turned out to be Luther's daughter.

36:09.012 --> 36:10.274
Really, Magnum,
with him as her father...

36:10.347 --> 36:12.008
I can hardly blame
her for fleeing.

36:12.082 --> 36:15.540
And if I don't find her or the guys
that killed her boyfriend by tomorrow...

36:15.619 --> 36:16.847
we're up on murder charges.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.182
Don't be ridiculous, Magnum...

36:18.254 --> 36:19.721
it won't stick.
It won't stick.

36:23.893 --> 36:25.190
I know that.

36:25.528 --> 36:26.859
Look, all I'm saying is...

36:26.930 --> 36:29.023
that was one frightened girl
I saw today.

36:29.099 --> 36:31.033
Now, whoever killed Gary
is after her.

36:31.201 --> 36:32.998
Why?
Why? How do I...

36:54.257 --> 36:57.818
Why does he always do that,
Jonathan?

36:57.994 --> 36:59.461
I don't know, Agatha.

37:00.263 --> 37:02.788
I think sometimes
our Creator is testing me.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.659
Indeed, it could be
for no other reason.

37:06.336 --> 37:09.794
If I thought otherwise, I believe
I truly would go irrevocably...

37:09.873 --> 37:11.898
irretrievably mad.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.045
<i>Higgins' question
was one I should have asked...</i>

37:26.122 --> 37:27.680
<i>a long time ago.</i>

37:27.757 --> 37:30.817
<i>Like when that cop held that
bag of marijuana in our faces.</i>

37:31.127 --> 37:34.324
<i>Whoever trashed Gary's apartment
wasn't interested in dope.</i>

37:45.642 --> 37:47.269
<i>And whatever they were
interested in...</i>

37:47.343 --> 37:49.436
<i>they believed
Nancy Perkins had it.</i>

37:49.512 --> 37:51.377
<i>Or would lead them to it...</i>

37:51.448 --> 37:54.576
<i>just as soon as Tanaka
took his boys out of the room.</i>

38:04.728 --> 38:06.628
<i>That's where me
and Luther came in...</i>

38:06.696 --> 38:08.095
<i>flush her out.</i>

38:08.164 --> 38:10.928
<i>I could almost hear this
guy's fingers on the phone.</i>

38:32.222 --> 38:34.349
<i>Knowing how jittery
little Nancy was...</i>

38:34.424 --> 38:36.654
<i>I thought honesty
would be the best policy.</i>

38:38.161 --> 38:39.753
Freeze! Police!

38:48.705 --> 38:50.104
You're not a cop.

38:51.908 --> 38:53.637
And you're not a hooker.

38:59.082 --> 39:02.279
Or a toaster repairman.
What are you hiding, Nancy?

39:08.358 --> 39:09.757
$30,000.

39:11.594 --> 39:12.993
Go ahead, take it!

39:13.863 --> 39:16.923
I don't care anymore.
You guys can have it all back.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.630
Gary was wrong, he shouldn't
have ripped off Artie.

39:20.537 --> 39:21.868
Now he's dead.

39:23.406 --> 39:24.668
Go ahead, take it!

39:33.249 --> 39:35.149
That's not what
I'm here for, Nancy.

39:35.852 --> 39:37.114
I'm here for you.

39:39.189 --> 39:40.417
You're not with Artie Keanu?

39:40.490 --> 39:42.481
No.
I'm a private investigator.

39:43.726 --> 39:45.717
Nancy, it's time
to go back to St. Louis.

39:48.832 --> 39:51.824
Oh, great.
Who hired you?

39:52.168 --> 39:55.660
My drunken mom or the two-timing
dipstick she married last year?

39:56.539 --> 39:59.736
Take me back to them?
No, thanks.

40:00.810 --> 40:02.744
And that goes double if you're
working for that creep...

40:02.812 --> 40:04.677
who calls himself my father.

40:05.548 --> 40:08.312
That creep who calls
himself your father...

40:08.384 --> 40:10.750
ran in front of a car
trying to get to you.

40:15.191 --> 40:16.522
That was him?

40:19.429 --> 40:20.919
Luther Gillis?

40:21.297 --> 40:22.286
You didn't know?

40:25.335 --> 40:27.530
I haven't seen him since
I was three years old.

40:30.073 --> 40:32.200
He ran out on me and my mom.

40:38.047 --> 40:39.947
I was just getting used to it.

40:40.516 --> 40:42.609
Maybe Luther hasn't.

40:42.685 --> 40:44.448
He really cares for you, Nancy.

40:46.422 --> 40:47.821
He wants you back.

40:50.860 --> 40:52.122
You sure?

40:53.363 --> 40:54.523
Yeah.

40:56.099 --> 40:57.862
I mean, if he loves me
so much...

40:59.602 --> 41:01.092
then why did he leave?

41:02.972 --> 41:04.200
If he loves me so much...

41:04.274 --> 41:07.835
then how come he keeps confusing my
birthday with my little brother's?

41:08.278 --> 41:10.678
I get birthday cards in August.

41:12.081 --> 41:14.072
It's like I'm a Pisces,
you know.

41:15.685 --> 41:17.619
At least he's trying.

41:21.057 --> 41:22.490
Maybe you can, too.

41:26.362 --> 41:27.886
It's too late.

41:28.831 --> 41:31.197
Nancy...

41:34.304 --> 41:36.636
you know what Luther would do
if he were here right now?

41:39.108 --> 41:40.166
Huh?

41:41.110 --> 41:42.099
What?

41:50.086 --> 41:51.849
Don't you touch me.

42:09.072 --> 42:10.869
That was him the other night.

42:15.011 --> 42:16.000
What?

42:17.347 --> 42:20.441
He gave me $5 to find out
if Gary was in.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.547
I didn't even know it was him.

42:22.618 --> 42:24.085
He didn't know it was me...

42:26.656 --> 42:29.181
and Gary was dead.
I'd just seen them do it.

42:30.126 --> 42:31.616
I was running.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.134
Okay, so...

42:40.870 --> 42:42.861
if you're not a cop and
you're not with the hoods...

42:42.939 --> 42:44.964
we've gotta get out
of here quick.

42:45.041 --> 42:46.338
Nancy...

42:47.176 --> 42:48.541
we've got nothing
to worry about.

42:51.047 --> 42:55.882
I've got two of my associates outside
waiting to cover us, right now.

42:56.486 --> 42:57.510
Really?

43:01.090 --> 43:02.216
Really.

43:06.596 --> 43:08.120
Hands on the
dashboard, you two...

43:08.197 --> 43:09.824
or your sons and daughters
will be orphans.

43:09.899 --> 43:12.390
We don't have any kids.
Who cares? You get the idea.

43:12.468 --> 43:14.902
Hands on the dashboard.
Take off those suspenders.

43:14.971 --> 43:16.199
Hey!
Hey, nothing.

43:16.272 --> 43:18.240
I'm gonna tie you two hoods
up with it for the cops.

43:18.307 --> 43:19.797
Hey, wait a minute, mister.
We're not-

43:28.484 --> 43:31.715
Relax, Nancy.
In about 60 seconds...

43:32.155 --> 43:34.521
my friends are gonna
come knocking at that door...

43:35.291 --> 43:37.122
and take you away.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.255
I'll call the police...

43:39.962 --> 43:42.487
and Artie Keanu will be history.

43:43.866 --> 43:45.766
Are you sure you know
what you're doing? Yep.

43:47.136 --> 43:49.104
<i>So you thought
I was out of the picture?</i>

43:49.172 --> 43:51.868
<i>Well, two tons of Detroit
steel bouncing off my head...</i>

43:51.941 --> 43:54.341
<i>or a gaggle of karate
screaming old ladies...</i>

43:54.444 --> 43:57.436
<i>ain't gonna stop Luther
Gillis, Private Investigator.</i>

43:57.513 --> 43:59.811
<i>I don't miss a trick, kiddos.</i>

44:04.487 --> 44:05.977
Can it, will you, guys?

44:24.240 --> 44:27.004
Great.
I think I hear 'em now.

44:29.312 --> 44:31.075
It's working like a charm.

44:51.701 --> 44:55.535
<i>So I finally closed
the book on file number 521.</i>

44:55.805 --> 44:59.434
<i>Little Nancy Perkins Gillis
was safe and sound.</i>

44:59.942 --> 45:01.807
<i>And Artie Canoe
and his cheap thugs...</i>

45:01.878 --> 45:05.177
<i>had more holes in 'em than 12
pounds of rotten Swiss cheese.</i>

45:05.781 --> 45:08.249
<i>It was all over
except the shouting.</i>

45:08.317 --> 45:09.841
You could have got me killed!

45:09.919 --> 45:12.285
Tom, in this business,
you got to take chances.

45:12.355 --> 45:14.289
When you start losing your
nerve, it's time to get out.

45:14.357 --> 45:16.257
Right. What chapter
was that one in?

45:16.325 --> 45:17.656
The last one...

45:17.727 --> 45:19.285
and I ain't got to it yet.

45:19.362 --> 45:21.728
Mr. Magnum, Mr. Gillis.
Come in.

45:21.797 --> 45:23.992
Hi, Sister. Came by to
say goodbye to Nancy.

45:24.066 --> 45:25.590
She's expecting you.

45:27.703 --> 45:31.537
By the way, we want to thank
you for the small offering.

45:32.141 --> 45:34.575
This one wasn't so small.
Yeah, right.

45:34.644 --> 45:37.340
Well, don't tell the Lieutenant,
you know, that Tanaka cat.

45:37.413 --> 45:39.643
Oh, the money
will be put to good use.

45:39.715 --> 45:41.148
As will Nancy.

45:41.617 --> 45:42.948
Thank you, Sister.

45:43.019 --> 45:45.283
I know you'll take
good care of my little girl.

45:45.354 --> 45:47.015
Oh, thank you.

45:47.490 --> 45:51.688
And I apologize for not being totally
honest with the two of you before...

45:52.094 --> 45:55.291
but that's because your daughter
was not totally honest with me.

45:55.431 --> 45:58.195
I'm afraid it kind of runs
in the family, Sister.

46:01.470 --> 46:03.233
Well, you take care, okay?

46:03.706 --> 46:04.900
I'll write to you.

46:05.274 --> 46:06.502
I promise, in March.

46:06.576 --> 46:07.804
See, I remembered.

46:07.877 --> 46:10.004
It's Timmy who's in August.

46:10.313 --> 46:11.803
That's Jimmy, Dad.

46:11.881 --> 46:13.781
Right. Right.
It's just a joke.

46:16.118 --> 46:17.915
If you ever decide
to run away again...

46:18.955 --> 46:20.820
you come to St. Louis,
okay?

46:35.471 --> 46:37.439
Come on,
I'll drive you to the airport.

46:37.506 --> 46:40.100
As a matter of fact, I'll
only be too happy to do it.

46:40.176 --> 46:41.165
Thanks.

46:43.212 --> 46:45.077
One question, Luther.

46:45.514 --> 46:46.708
What?

46:46.782 --> 46:50.343
Well, how did you know to go
back to Gary's rooming house?

46:50.419 --> 46:52.580
I mean, I went through a lot
to figure that one out.

46:52.655 --> 46:55.624
Easy. They always return
to the scene of the crime.

46:56.225 --> 46:57.556
Chapter 11.

47:02.732 --> 47:04.097
<i>And if he believed that...</i>

47:04.166 --> 47:06.896
<i>I got some swampland
in Florida for him, too.</i>
