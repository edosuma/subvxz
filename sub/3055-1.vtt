ALLYSON: Okay.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.439
(SIGHS)

00:29.440 --> 00:31.524
It's blog time.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.599
I am a mommy blogger.
I am a mommy blogger.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.679
Get ready, world, for some pearls
of wisdom, coming at you right now.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.279
So here we go!

00:41.280 --> 00:43.011
(SIGHS)

00:44.120 --> 00:46.363
I got three followers. (CHUCKLES)

00:46.760 --> 00:51.006
Yesterday I had four,
so that's awesome.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.002
My audience awaits.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.969
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

01:00.200 --> 01:03.919
It's 5:00 a.m. Do you know
where your children are?

01:03.920 --> 01:05.759
Mine are in bed.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.959
I should be in bed.
It's Mother's Day.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.728
But I'm not. Wanna know why?

01:17.120 --> 01:19.045
(CLATTERING)

01:23.000 --> 01:24.399
Because I'm a clean freak!

01:24.400 --> 01:26.484
I am talking freaky, deaky, Dutch.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.839
If you were to lock me away in a
white room, in a straitjacket,

01:28.840 --> 01:31.319
it would actually feel comforting.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.159
As long as the walls were
spotless and nobody wore shoes.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.519
I can actually feel
the house getting dirty.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.119
Like I have nerve
endings in the carpet.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.161
And it affects me.
Wanna know how?

01:44.520 --> 01:47.399
First, I feel distracted.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.926
"Distracted."

01:49.040 --> 01:52.239
D-I-S... Oh, what was I...

01:52.240 --> 01:53.599
So, see, like right now,

01:53.600 --> 01:55.959
I'm thinking of the cleaning
supplies I left out

01:55.960 --> 01:57.559
and how one of the kids is
gonna get up and drink Clorox

01:57.560 --> 01:58.879
and then I'd end up having
to call Poison Control,

01:58.880 --> 01:59.919
and they'd say,

01:59.920 --> 02:01.879
"Sorry, Mrs. Field,
too many times this month."

02:01.880 --> 02:03.199
And take my kids away.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.879
Too many times
this month, Ms. Field.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.759
We're here to take
your children away.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.679
ALLYSON: (SIGHS)
I've played it all out.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.399
I'm sure you've
played this all out.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.961
Which is kind of morbid.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.167
After I feel distracted,
I feel stressed.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.805
Then I have a moment.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.211
GIRL: Mom!

02:23.720 --> 02:25.849
Mommy!

02:26.280 --> 02:28.399
I am talking to Daddy!

02:28.400 --> 02:31.479
This is me having a moment
with my daughter.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.319
Hon, (CLEARS THROAT)
about the stress level.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.319
- (SIGHS) What?
- Well, it's a little high.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.159
- Gee, uh...
- The kind of psycho thing you just did...

02:37.160 --> 02:38.399
Did you just call me psycho?

02:38.400 --> 02:40.119
- No! No. No. No.
- Did you just call me psycho?

02:40.120 --> 02:41.646
It was a little psycho.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.239
This is me having a moment
with some helpless newlyweds.

02:45.240 --> 02:49.247
We just wanted to
say congratulations!

02:49.280 --> 02:52.079
And savor this moment in your life!

02:52.080 --> 02:54.999
So when I started to speak,
I thought it would help.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.599
But then the words just started
coming out of me like lava.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.959
Because you're gonna blink,
seriously, like, blink

02:58.960 --> 03:00.079
and it's all gonna be over

03:00.080 --> 03:01.799
and replaced with
just volume, like...

03:01.800 --> 03:02.999
GIRL: Mom!

03:03.000 --> 03:05.439
Amazing, amazing
beautiful volume...

03:05.440 --> 03:08.159
Look at that. Look at
that look on her face.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.599
That's the look of a girl
whose fairytale just ended.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.159
I murdered it.
I am a fairytale murderer.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.370
You can only take so much
before you crack!

03:17.640 --> 03:19.279
- Don't.
- No.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.879
ALLYSON: I'm like the Bruce
Banner of stay-at-home moms.

03:21.880 --> 03:25.959
He doesn't want to turn into
the Hulk. It just happens.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.319
(BELLOWING)

03:27.320 --> 03:28.959
Which is exactly how I feel.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.486
I love my kids.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.959
I love my husband. My minivan,
my minivan is awesome.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.806
I have this incredible life.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.999
So, why do I feel this way?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.686
GIRL IN DISTANCE: Mom!

03:45.600 --> 03:46.959
Mom!

03:46.960 --> 03:48.566
(GRUNTS)

03:49.880 --> 03:52.726
GIRL: Mommy!

03:54.240 --> 03:55.559
Oh.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.325
(MUTTERING)

03:57.440 --> 03:59.046
Oh.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.919
Surprise! We made you eggs!

04:01.920 --> 04:03.399
With sugar!

04:03.400 --> 04:05.279
Mother's happy day!

04:05.280 --> 04:07.489
(ALLYSON SPEAKING)

04:08.000 --> 04:10.319
I should be happy that
they're making me breakfast.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.519
Instead, all I see is salmonella.
Salmonella everywhere.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.759
On the floor, on the
counter, on my children.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.358
I'm a salmonella-phobe.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.279
Last week this happened to
a doll and I burned it!

04:21.279 --> 04:24.119
Okay, so I didn't realize that
that was Bailey's favorite doll,

04:24.120 --> 04:25.759
and I do feel bad about that.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.969
We're gonna play a little
game! Everybody freeze!

04:31.040 --> 04:33.199
Beck, no. Do not put that...

04:33.200 --> 04:35.039
Oh, no. No, no, he's gonna eat it.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.799
He'll put that in
his mouth and become

04:36.800 --> 04:38.199
one of the estimated
400 people that die

04:38.200 --> 04:39.519
from acute salmonella poisoning,

04:39.520 --> 04:41.839
which I read about on a blog
somewhere. Yeah, okay. I gotta go.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.366
Do not put that finger in your...

04:53.000 --> 04:54.640
(LINE RINGING)

04:55.200 --> 04:57.807
Hello, may Field's
residence, please?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.199
Well, how about you try,

04:59.200 --> 05:01.839
"This is the Fields' residence.
How may I help you?"

05:01.840 --> 05:03.519
(GASPS) Daddy!

05:03.520 --> 05:05.039
Hey, is Mommy there?

05:05.040 --> 05:07.999
Mom! Phone!

05:08.000 --> 05:09.561
Wow.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.639
(ALLYSON MUTTERING)

05:11.640 --> 05:14.079
Bailey, I'm up here!

05:14.080 --> 05:15.641
(BECK GIGGLES)

05:15.880 --> 05:17.639
Beck? Beck?

05:17.640 --> 05:18.799
(GIGGLES)

05:18.800 --> 05:19.919
Here's Daddy.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.599
Hello? Hey, hon.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.599
Sean, please tell me you're
on a flight right now.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.319
It's Mother's Day.
Happy Mother's Day.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.399
That's where we
should have started.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.079
Yes, thank you. Fine. I just...

05:28.080 --> 05:30.159
Why I need you on a flight...

05:30.160 --> 05:31.399
- That's all right.
- Yes, baby.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.519
- They canceled three flights on me.
- Mommy, I made you this.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.759
The airlines are taking care of it.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.400
I got a direct flight. Hello?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.919
You made this for me? (CHUCKLES)

05:38.920 --> 05:40.439
BAILEY: You wanna know
why you're so big?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.519
ALLYSON: Why?

05:41.520 --> 05:44.924
Because you love us
the most of everybody.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.121
Where's Daddy?

05:47.280 --> 05:51.639
Up in the plane in the sky,
where he always is.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.599
Ouch. That's not right.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.606
Mom! Beck's playing
in the toilet again!

05:56.640 --> 05:57.759
SEAN: No, no, no. Not the potty.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.439
Not the potty! Not the potty!

05:59.440 --> 06:00.519
It's fine.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.959
ALLYSON: Beck!

06:01.960 --> 06:03.359
Oh.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.119
Sean, I don't know.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.479
I'm thinking maybe I don't wanna
celebrate Mother's Day ever again.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.679
Why would you say that?

06:09.680 --> 06:13.639
Because I am terrible at
this, in every single way.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.079
So just do not celebrate me!

06:15.080 --> 06:16.839
What? Come on.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.519
You are an awesome mom.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.439
The kids are messy, you know.
Kids get messy.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.959
Oh, yeah?

06:21.960 --> 06:24.959
I ran out of space, so I
did the rest on the wall.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.039
SEAN: On the wall?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.879
She's writing on the wall?

06:27.880 --> 06:29.119
What kind of markers is she using?

06:29.120 --> 06:31.319
The come-off kind? Hello?

06:31.320 --> 06:32.881
(PHONE BEEPS)

06:33.640 --> 06:36.566
You got kids? Want mine?
(CHUCKLES)

06:37.320 --> 06:40.485
(♪♪♪)

06:49.080 --> 06:51.005
(♪♪♪)

06:57.240 --> 06:59.642
(♪♪♪)

07:06.680 --> 07:08.241
Ah.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.401
- Hey.
- (LAUGHTER)

07:11.840 --> 07:13.679
ALLYSON: Now that's a mom.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.319
Talk about perfect.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.085
Oh, yeah, I bet she has a nanny.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.487
Okay, everybody, best
behavior. It's Mother's Day.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.359
Mommy, let me do it.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.519
No, baby. We're running
really late today, okay?

07:28.520 --> 07:30.729
Let me!

07:40.240 --> 07:41.639
Mom, slow down.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.239
Walk with me, Zoe.
Just walk and talk.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.719
But, Mom, you're, like,
the fastest person on Earth.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.999
ALLYSON: This is Sondra.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.559
My Catcher in the Rye. My crutch.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.770
My Dr. Phil, Oprah and Gandalf all
rolled into one ball of goodness.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.279
Her only perceived flaw is that she
has no idea what auto-correct is.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.364
No. No, no, that's not what I...

07:59.600 --> 08:01.479
Oh! Technology!

08:01.480 --> 08:02.927
(SCOFFS)

08:03.560 --> 08:05.239
Mom, it's really...
It's just a dance

08:05.240 --> 08:07.399
and there's gonna
be some laser lights

08:07.400 --> 08:09.039
and some glow sticks and that's it.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.399
A rave is not a dance.
Trust your mother.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.559
But, Mom, a lot of the
kids from church are...

08:14.560 --> 08:15.959
- Uh, uh, uh...
- They're even...

08:15.960 --> 08:17.719
- I don't care!
- Seriously?

08:17.720 --> 08:19.039
I don't care!

08:19.040 --> 08:20.599
- Come on, have a heart.
- Zoe!

08:20.600 --> 08:22.559
Mom, you always do this.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.079
You're gonna murder my social life.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.799
Well, maybe it deserves to die.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.919
You know you're not allowed
to date until you're 17,

08:27.920 --> 08:29.639
so we have a winner.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.039
Yeah, and a loser.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.328
I have "Preacher's Kid"
stamped on my forehead.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.279
Oh, there you are.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.679
- Did you find my notes?
- Yeah, right there.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.599
Perfect. Where'd you find
them? I looked everywhere.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.919
- I'll just take that.
- What's wrong with that one?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.839
Video guy says
your tie is strobing,

08:41.840 --> 08:43.318
so this one will be better.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.119
Okay. Notes were on
your desk, corner pile.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.599
- Hey, Dad. (CHUCKLES)
- Hey.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.039
You were so awesome
in the first service

08:49.040 --> 08:50.479
and I was just wondering what...

08:50.480 --> 08:52.319
Sweetheart, I know
what you're doing,

08:52.320 --> 08:54.119
but we've already
talked and we agree.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.681
Points for trying, though.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.079
I didn't even get a fair shot.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.481
- Love you.
- SONDRA: Love you.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.726
(♪♪♪)

09:03.160 --> 09:04.639
(EXHALES)

09:04.640 --> 09:08.119
Good morning. Somebody
has a birthday, right?

09:08.120 --> 09:10.329
Nice to see you.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.446
(WHISPERS) Come here.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.799
- Hey, did you get that recipe I sent?
- Yes. Thank you.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.959
Oh, good. Good. Nice to see you.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.319
Thank you so much for coming.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.639
Hey, Ally, hey.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.519
Oh, you having a rough morning?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.639
Sondra, just tell me
it's all gonna be okay.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.839
It's all gonna be okay. Just give
it five years and you'll be...

09:26.840 --> 09:28.159
- Years?
- Seven or five...

09:28.160 --> 09:29.599
Do you want me to
help you with the kids?

09:29.600 --> 09:31.039
Brandon!

09:31.040 --> 09:33.044
Buddy, what are you doing?

09:33.520 --> 09:35.279
- Do you need some help?
- No, I've come this far.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.879
- I am going to finish this.
- Okay.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.359
Let's go. Let's go. This way. This way.
Around. Around. Let's go.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.199
Good morning, y'all!
How is everyone?

09:42.200 --> 09:43.519
BOTH: Great.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.129
Oh, Sondra. You are such
an inspiration to me.

09:47.680 --> 09:52.210
(LAUGHS) And you. You are so blessed
to have her as your mother.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.079
- I am just so blessed.

You don't have to be sorry.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.319
You have to choose to do
something for yourself.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.719
Do something for yourself.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.639
You have to do it. You're the
only one who can do that.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.679
Sean. But...

21:23.680 --> 21:25.719
It's the kind of thing
that if you just...

21:25.720 --> 21:27.359
Sean, I don't need
a lecture right now.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.839
What? This is not a lecture.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.479
This is not helpful in
this particular moment.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.679
I'm not lecturing you.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.799
Honey, I'm listening to you.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.799
I'm sitting here
and I am listening to you.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.719
I know, I know you're listening.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.281
And I'm hearing you.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.959
(SEAN EXHALES)

21:39.960 --> 21:42.039
You doing both of those things?

21:42.040 --> 21:43.919
- Listening and hearing?
- (CHUCKLES)

21:43.920 --> 21:45.239
I am. I'm very talented.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.399
- Oh. You are talented.
- Yes, I am.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.559
I'm showing marked improvement.
You have to give me that.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.599
- I'm... I...
- I want credit.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.799
(DOORBELL RINGS)

21:50.800 --> 21:52.399
Who is that?

21:52.400 --> 21:54.719
(SIGHS) That'll be Bridget.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.799
What?

21:55.800 --> 21:59.279
Yeah, I called Bridget and invited her
to dinner, and, uh, then I forgot.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.359
Dinner?

22:00.360 --> 22:01.479
- Yeah.
- BRIDGET: Open up, you community of losers.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.559
- I'm hungry.
- It's okay. Just...

22:03.560 --> 22:06.439
You know, it's fine. We'll
just whip something up.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.239
- Oh, we'll just whip something up?
- Yeah.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.319
Yeah, 'cause that's usually how
that happens. We do it together.

22:11.320 --> 22:15.039
Looking forward to whipping
something up with you, together.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.159
Wind it up! Whoop, whoop!

22:16.160 --> 22:18.079
ALLYSON: This is Sean's
half-sister, Bridget.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.039
Bridget says awkward things.
Bridget has no filter.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.999
Hey, I'm not done with that!

22:23.000 --> 22:24.606
Give it back.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.039
So, um, great news.
I got a new job.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.319
We needed a little more,

22:30.320 --> 22:32.719
so, um, I picked up a night
shift at a bowling alley.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.281
- ALLYSON: Cool.
- (BRIDGET LAUGHS)

22:35.080 --> 22:37.079
SEAN: That is unbelievably cool.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.599
ALLYSON: Oh, no. Here it comes.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.560
She knows I compulsively
take care of people.

22:40.561 --> 22:42.689
(ALLYSON READING)

22:44.680 --> 22:46.159
I can't say no.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.839
I start on Saturday night
and I was hoping

22:47.840 --> 22:49.526
you could watch Phoenix
while I work.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.278
- Saturday night?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:51.279 --> 22:53.079
Oh, yeah, um, normally, yes.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.639
But I'm actually glad
you brought that up

22:54.640 --> 22:57.599
because I planned this,
uh, moms' night thing.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.799
- BRIDGET: Oh.
- You what?

22:58.800 --> 23:00.247
For Saturday.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.639
You planned a moms' night?

23:01.640 --> 23:03.087
I did. I planned one.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.839
BRIDGET: You always babysit
Phoenix on the weekends.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.679
(LAUGHS) I was sort of counting
on you when I got the job.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.684
Yeah, um...

23:12.600 --> 23:14.639
You know when a flight attendant

23:14.640 --> 23:17.039
goes through the safety thing?

23:17.040 --> 23:20.279
You know when they say, uh, you have
to put on your oxygen mask first

23:20.280 --> 23:22.319
- before assisting others?
- Are we flying somewhere?

23:22.320 --> 23:23.599
Is this what we're...

23:23.600 --> 23:24.999
Yeah. Yeah, you need
your oxygen mask.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.839
You have to have your mask
on before assisting others.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.159
- Ah.
- Right? Before you can help others!

23:31.160 --> 23:32.439
BRIDGET: Wow, Sean. We get it!

23:32.440 --> 23:34.679
It's a metaphor. I think we both...
We got it.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.999
It's a very good metaphor. Thank
you for pointing that out.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.159
You're welcome.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.919
- You will go...
- Saturday.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.879
- Saturday night. You will go Saturday night.
- Saturday night.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.159
- Saturday night?
- Saturday night.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.399
- Really?
- It's Saturday.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.319
Oh, no! Sean can't play video games

23:46.320 --> 23:48.839
on Saturday night
with his loser friends.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.239
First of all, that's low.
You don't even know Kevin.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.639
I know Kevin.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.479
ALLYSON: Kevin is Sean's friend.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.999
Sean met Kevin when they
were in the fifth grade.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.359
(BLOWING)

23:58.360 --> 24:00.879
They started playing video
games as juveniles.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.839
They still play video
games like juveniles.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.519
Don't stand right
behind me, move over!

24:05.520 --> 24:07.199
No, no, no, no, no.
Backup, backup.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.559
(STAMMERS)

24:08.560 --> 24:10.007
I just died.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.519
ALLYSON: Kevin hates kids.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.719
Well, I hate kids.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.799
You don't hate kids.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.119
I hate kids.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.119
ALLYSON: Somehow Sean
justifies this relationship.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.199
No, I didn't shoot you.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.759
The guy behind you shot you.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.959
I use video games to
transition from work stress.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.805
That's my oxygen!

24:24.840 --> 24:28.439
I put mine on, video,
I can help you put yours on,

24:28.440 --> 24:30.519
and then you can help
the rest of the world.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.719
Thank you.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.279
(SIGHS) Who's gonna watch
the baby? What about Joey?

24:35.280 --> 24:37.039
ALLYSON: Joey is Bridget's ex.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.090
He's a fun guy.

24:39.360 --> 24:42.439
In a non-committal, allergic to
all responsibility kind of way.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.479
No. I tried that.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.399
SEAN: Here's the thing,
you're going out

24:46.400 --> 24:49.439
and I'm gonna, uh, watch Phoenix.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.279
- ALLYSON: You're gonna watch Phoenix?
- I will watch Phoenix.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.206
Big brother to the rescue once
again and everybody's happy.

24:54.280 --> 24:58.319
I don't need your charity and I
certainly don't need your metaphors.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.719
So I'm gonna go

24:59.720 --> 25:03.319
get you to bed 'cause that's
the responsible thing to do.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.759
'Cause I'm so responsible.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.919
Later.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.321
See you later.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.167
Look for your oxygen!
You'll find it!

25:13.560 --> 25:15.199
- (SIGHS)
- (DOOR CLOSES)

25:15.200 --> 25:16.599
Thought that went well.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.159
And also, uh, Marco's
bringing the twins over

25:19.160 --> 25:21.039
because he's afraid
to watch them alone.

25:21.040 --> 25:24.171
- What?
- Surprise! Sorry.

I'm not gonna call you unless
there's a natural disaster

even call you, okay?

have to define violence

39:41.160 --> 39:44.245
That kind of... That
threw me a little bit.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.599
Well, this was a good idea, Ally.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.839
We're having fun after all.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.559
Hey, um, so I am really sorry about

39:51.560 --> 39:54.167
that horrifying display back there.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.639
I actually think I might be
going a little bit crazy.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.361
No, you were just having
a moment. That's all.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.999
It was, like, my fifth
one this week. So...

40:04.000 --> 40:05.599
It happens to everyone.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.239
- (LAUGHS) Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:07.240 --> 40:11.690
Yet somehow I can't quite picture
you having a moment like that.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.159
So, how is the blog going?

40:14.160 --> 40:15.879
Oh, the blog.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.248
It's... It's

40:19.240 --> 40:22.599
not coming really at all.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.999
I can't...

40:24.000 --> 40:26.839
I can't really find
anything worth saying.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.159
And then when I sit down to try,

40:28.160 --> 40:30.119
I just wind up staring
at that eagle's nest.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.719
You have completely ruined me.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.279
And Ray thinks it's crazy.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.199
No, seriously,
I cannot stop watching it.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.439
Like, it is a problem.

40:39.440 --> 40:43.839
I don't know, Sondra.
I just feel like

40:43.840 --> 40:48.529
she's so there.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.921
You know, like, she's peaceful.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.121
And she's happy.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.039
Are you happy?

41:04.040 --> 41:05.965
Look, Ally.

41:06.600 --> 41:10.129
Life is not about a parking space.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.679
It's not about God taking
away all our problems

41:13.680 --> 41:15.764
and making everything perfect.

41:15.840 --> 41:20.919
It's about finding the meaning and
the joy and the purpose in this,

41:20.920 --> 41:23.239
in all the chaos and the crazy.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.839
And it's knowing...

41:24.840 --> 41:26.239
It's knowing that God is with you

41:26.240 --> 41:29.086
on the good days and the bad days.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.279
You know, does my
faith give me that?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.759
Yes, it does.

41:32.760 --> 41:36.767
Am I always happy?
No, that's a fantasy.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.525
- Think I'm...
- Hmm.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.399
- Hey, Ally.
- Yeah.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.199
Thank you for inviting me tonight.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.199
You know, it's the first time anyone
from the church has invited me

41:53.200 --> 41:57.082
to something like this for...
First time in five years.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.081
Of course.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.681
(QUIETLY) Yeah.

42:04.440 --> 42:07.446
- Hey, yeah. Yes, going.
- Ooh.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.526
Hey, can I ask you something?

42:09.920 --> 42:11.279
Little free advice.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.599
Sure.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.399
Hey, Ally. It's me.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.839
Uh, just wanted
to let you know that

42:39.840 --> 42:41.879
everything is going great here.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.359
Uh, we're all good.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.319
Um, we're gonna take a
little trip to the hospital.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.722
Are you kidding me? You
want 50 tickets for this?

42:48.200 --> 42:49.839
That's extortion.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.999
Beck got himself caught in
the Rocket to Mars game.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.039
They didn't have to use the jaws
of life to get him out this time,

42:55.040 --> 42:56.119
thank goodness.

42:56.120 --> 42:58.159
Uh, he's free now
and he's looking good,

42:58.160 --> 43:00.119
his vitals are good.
He's stable.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.479
They say we gotta take him down

43:01.480 --> 43:03.679
to have him looked at, anyway.

43:03.680 --> 43:07.079
Uh, a matter of policy, which is
fine, because I sort of, um...

43:07.080 --> 43:10.119
I dislocated my shoulder trying
to get him out of there.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.759
(CHUCKLES) Funny thing.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.959
KEVIN: We spent 50 bucks
and got 200 tickets,

43:13.960 --> 43:15.999
so I expect something
of equal or greater value.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.639
- Like a, like a, like a...
- Puppy!

43:17.640 --> 43:19.679
Yes! A live animal.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.359
I want something
like a live animal.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.519
Like a turtle or
one of those pet pigs.

43:23.520 --> 43:24.679
I'd like a pet pig.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.159
SEAN: Me and the Beckster are
kind of cruising on our own.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.199
(GROANS) They need the minivan
to move the kids around.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.559
We know where you are, so we're just
gonna slip into the parking lot

43:31.560 --> 43:33.479
and switch the keys out
for the minivan.

43:33.480 --> 43:38.039
And, uh, Marco told, uh... Texted
Izzy that, so she should...

43:38.040 --> 43:39.439
She should know that.

43:39.440 --> 43:40.999
Uh, I'm pretty sure
she got most of that.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.279
What about the bouncy balls, right?

43:42.280 --> 43:44.439
I mean, kids like the bouncy balls.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.999
Marco, that's a choking hazard.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.239

that knows this stuff?

44:36.440 --> 44:38.444
- What?
- Well, you're...

44:38.680 --> 44:42.439
No, because if I was,
I would be freaking out

44:42.440 --> 44:45.039
that my husband
would go whimpering into

44:45.040 --> 44:46.885
a fetal position
like he did last time.

44:47.080 --> 44:50.324

I didn't get any of that.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.079
Hey, Bridge.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.919
Yeah, we're, uh, you know,
glow-in-the-dark bowling.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.319
Which is so fun!

45:13.320 --> 45:15.039
It is, really. But it's
actually not that fun.

to be on the Dance Cam?

45:19.440 --> 45:20.559

Oh, no, no, no. We can't have
any of this at our table.

46:05.280 --> 46:08.319
who'd you wind up
getting to babysit Phoenix?

46:08.320 --> 46:09.439
Oh, I just asked Joey to do it.

owed Phoenix some Daddy time.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.039
Shh. Where's my bird?
Where's my bird?

49:23.040 --> 49:25.010
I sat on it.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.439
- Hmm.
- I'm dead.

49:27.440 --> 49:28.839
- I'm gonna kill you!
- No, no.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.447
- Kill you!
- ALLYSON: Stop, stop. Okay, okay.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.239
In your sleep!

49:33.240 --> 49:35.768
ALLYSON: Yep, yep. Okay. Let's go.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.039
JOEY: It's...

49:38.040 --> 49:39.599
Just, it's nothing. It's...

49:39.600 --> 49:40.799
How am I supposed to get him?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.239
I took the bus to get here.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.799
If I leave work early
on my first night,

49:43.800 --> 49:45.639
I'm gonna get fired!
On my first night!

49:45.640 --> 49:47.039
I need this job.

49:47.040 --> 49:49.319
- Ally.
- I've got the van.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.159
We'll run, we'll pick him up.
We can fix this.

49:51.160 --> 49:52.479
Get right back on schedule.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.279
Best night out ever will just be
on pause for 30 minutes, right?

49:55.280 --> 49:57.364
And then do what with the baby?

49:58.240 --> 50:02.008
I haven't gotten that far yet.
Let's get the van, then...

50:03.360 --> 50:04.807
Where's the van?

50:05.080 --> 50:06.759
I parked it right there.

50:06.760 --> 50:08.759
IZZY: It only takes a couple
of seconds to steal a car.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.159
That's what Marco says.
Always lock everything up.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.370
I did! Am I crazy?

50:15.440 --> 50:18.286
So, what do I do? Do I
report it to the police?

50:19.720 --> 50:21.326
With what phones?

50:22.000 --> 50:24.199
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no!

50:24.200 --> 50:26.759
You guys don't have phones?

50:26.760 --> 50:29.128
Okay, I'm freaking out now.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.719
My phone's back at work.
We'll just use mine.

50:31.720 --> 50:32.839
Okay, great. Let's go.

50:32.840 --> 50:35.119
Oh, hey, can you ask them and
see if they saw anything?

50:35.120 --> 50:37.199
And don't forget our shoes.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.639
But maybe not wear them.
My feet are killing me.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.769
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

50:43.760 --> 50:45.439
Uh, uh, there, uh...

50:45.440 --> 50:46.959
There are a bunch
of stickers on there.

50:46.960 --> 50:51.439
So, there's a fish one
that's pretty faded.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.524
And, um, "Eat Organic."

(STAMMERING)
There are a bunch of others,

51:01.120 --> 51:02.599
but I don't really
wanna talk about them.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.319
But you get the idea. Okay?

51:04.320 --> 51:06.039
It's an emergency. It's personal.

51:06.040 --> 51:07.719
ALLYSON: We think it was
taken sometime around 8:00.

51:07.720 --> 51:09.319
- Hey, I called a cab.
- Great.

51:09.320 --> 51:11.131
Okay, thank you very much.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.439
Are you sure this is the
fastest way to Davis Street?

51:18.440 --> 51:20.439
(ENGLISH ACCENT) Absolutely.
This is the fastest way.

51:20.440 --> 51:22.241
Why don't you just
cut over on to Eighth?

51:22.400 --> 51:24.479
He should take the expressway.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.079
Are you from England?

51:26.080 --> 51:30.007
No, I just watched a little bit of
the BBC and I picked up the accent.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.319
I'm a cabbie, luv.
It's my occupation.

51:32.320 --> 51:35.639
Why do people from other
countries always sound smarter?

51:35.640 --> 51:39.199
Because we are smarter, which
is why this is the fastest way.

51:39.200 --> 51:41.199
- Okay, can you step on it?
- Why, you're all very lovely,

51:41.200 --> 51:44.319
but, no, I'm not gonna get a
ticket for the four of you.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.679
Well, we're trying
to find her baby,

51:45.680 --> 51:47.319
who happens to be stuck
in a tattoo parlor.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.324
Yeah, well, that's none
of my business.

Right.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.400
Onward!

52:02.240 --> 52:03.971
I'm sorry. Where are
we going again?

52:15.080 --> 52:16.679
So, can you wait just five minutes?

52:16.680 --> 52:18.199
Is that an actual five minutes,

52:18.200 --> 52:19.799
or is that a ladies'
night five minutes?

52:19.800 --> 52:22.487
How long can it take to get a baby?

52:24.480 --> 52:25.961
Is Bones here?

52:26.520 --> 52:27.919
Yeah, he's working.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.159
Can you go get him, please?
'Cause I have a question for him.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.519

- He, apparently, has her baby...

52:31.520 --> 52:33.399

I need to talk to him right now.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.559
Simmer down, y'all. I can't even
understand what you're saying right now.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.849
Like, Chill.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.765
For real.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.999
Look, we're here to get Phoenix.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.639
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Phoenix.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.359
Rising from the ashes.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.799
That's number 97 over there.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.719
But I think you should
do it across your back,

52:51.720 --> 52:53.799
'cause it'll be real
pretty-like right there.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.079
No, no, no, she was talking...

52:55.080 --> 52:56.479
- Shh!
- Sorry.

52:56.480 --> 52:57.759
Phoenix is my baby.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.241
Well, do you have a picture?

52:59.760 --> 53:03.199
'Cause Bones needs a picture
to get the tattoo perfect.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.759
You know what I'm saying? 'Cause
them little hellions are hard to draw.

53:05.760 --> 53:06.839

53:06.840 --> 53:09.439
None of us want a tattoo!

53:09.440 --> 53:11.039
I want a tattoo.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.090
- Yeah, you do.
- Okay.

53:14.120 --> 53:18.039
Phoenix is my baby
and he's in the back.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.439
And we are here to pick him up.

53:20.440 --> 53:23.919
But who would bring a baby
to a tattoo parlor?

53:23.920 --> 53:25.759

53:55.920 --> 53:59.679
Okay, so, there's no baby
back there, which is awesome.

53:59.680 --> 54:02.239
But you guys had me.
I was a little scared,

54:02.240 --> 54:04.959
like, maybe you were from the
health department or something.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.039
Okay. We're gonna
come up with a plan.

54:06.040 --> 54:07.119
You were gonna arrest me,

54:07.120 --> 54:10.799
or maybe worse, cut off
my hair, like, what!

54:10.800 --> 54:11.839
- We'll figure it out.
- Okay.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.359
What would happen
if you cut my hair?

54:14.360 --> 54:17.079
It's okay, though. Look, Bones is
gonna help you when he's done.

54:17.080 --> 54:19.050

Like, we're good.

I'm gonna call the police.

gonna have to ask you to leave

- Ladies.

been eyeing me the whole night.

- Follow mama bear. That's right.
