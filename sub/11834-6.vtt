00:00.834 --> 00:03.703
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:03.767 --> 00:06.436
My client was in shock at
the time of this interrogation.

00:06.469 --> 00:09.773
He'd just found his wife dead
less than an hour before this.

00:09.806 --> 00:11.441
She said that if she
turned up missing

00:11.474 --> 00:13.143
that I should
call the police

00:13.176 --> 00:14.678
because Scott probably
did something to her.

00:14.711 --> 00:16.312
BOBBY: Objection!

00:16.346 --> 00:20.183
We find the defendant
Scott Wallace...guilty.

00:20.216 --> 00:22.118
You got to get me out.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.286
-Scott--
-Get me out!

00:23.319 --> 00:24.788
You got a problem.

00:24.821 --> 00:27.591
The man is on the verge
of a psychotic breakdown.

00:27.624 --> 00:29.726
He needs to be transferred
to a mental facility right now.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.795
I'm convinced
that Kyle Barrett

00:31.828 --> 00:33.196
lied on the stand

00:33.229 --> 00:35.331
after being coached
by the prosecution.

00:35.365 --> 00:37.467
Mr. Barrett,
you had a meeting

00:37.500 --> 00:39.202
with Richard Bay
and Helen Gamble, did you not?

00:39.235 --> 00:40.671
On the advice of counsel,

00:40.704 --> 00:43.339
I'm exercising
my fifth amendment right

00:43.373 --> 00:45.241
not to answer your question.

00:45.275 --> 00:47.611
I have been ordered
to conduct a full hearing

00:47.644 --> 00:49.412
into this perjury business.

00:49.445 --> 00:50.881
That hearing has been thwarted
by the primary witness

00:50.914 --> 00:53.283
exercising his
fifth amendment right.

00:53.316 --> 00:55.619
The conviction of Scott Wallace
is hereby set aside.

00:55.652 --> 00:58.855
It is the order of this court
that he be granted a new trial.

00:58.889 --> 01:01.091
This is the part
that kills us.

01:03.727 --> 01:05.128
That's the bomb.

01:05.161 --> 01:07.497
This time
you will have to testify.

01:07.531 --> 01:09.900
I can handle all the witnesses.
We're in good shape there.

01:09.933 --> 01:11.467
But that videotape

01:11.501 --> 01:13.837
and your response to it
on the stand--

01:13.870 --> 01:16.206
that's what will decide
this case.

01:16.239 --> 01:17.774
I'm ready.

01:19.776 --> 01:23.747
REPORTER:
Do you feel pressure
because he's your friend

01:23.780 --> 01:26.216
or because you failed him?

01:26.249 --> 01:28.785
Both.

01:28.819 --> 01:31.421
I want to get him out
because I care about him

01:31.454 --> 01:35.491
and, yeah, because I tried
a lousy case.

01:35.525 --> 01:38.394
Of course I feel pressure.
How could I not?

01:38.428 --> 01:40.230
This guy committed murder,

01:40.263 --> 01:44.334
and the only thing standing
between him and the street...

01:44.367 --> 01:45.702
is me.

01:45.736 --> 01:48.171
It's a bit unusual
for the lead prosecutor

01:48.204 --> 01:50.607
to suddenly flip
and think he's innocent.

01:50.641 --> 01:53.577
Helen Gamble started
feeling guilty over tactics,

01:53.610 --> 01:55.712
and she became clouded
by her conscience.

01:55.746 --> 01:57.247
That's all.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.284
She claims you coached
a witness to lie.

02:01.317 --> 02:02.886
She's wrong.

02:02.919 --> 02:05.288
Richard Bay
will do anything.

02:05.321 --> 02:09.359
D.A.s like him make it easier
for defense attorneys like me

02:09.392 --> 02:11.828
to stay passionate
about what we do

02:11.862 --> 02:15.732
because to me, he basically
represents a police state.

02:15.766 --> 02:18.635
Oh, I don't expect it
to be at all civil.

02:18.669 --> 02:20.971
Bobby Donnell
fights for clients

02:21.004 --> 02:23.439
like it was his life
on the line

02:23.473 --> 02:27.277
and Richard Bay prosecutes
like the victim was his mother.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.813
Isn't that good--
zealous advocates?

02:29.846 --> 02:32.448
Isn't that
what it should be about?

02:32.482 --> 02:33.650
One would think,

02:33.684 --> 02:35.819
but when fights
get this ugly,

02:35.852 --> 02:38.488
it's rarely in
the interest of truth.

02:38.521 --> 02:40.957
It's messy.
It gets personal.

02:40.991 --> 02:42.826
Do you think you'll win?

02:42.859 --> 02:44.294
I know I will.

02:44.327 --> 02:45.962
How can you be so sure?

02:45.996 --> 02:47.964
Because this time
I have the video,

02:47.998 --> 02:49.733
which means Scott Wallace

02:49.766 --> 02:51.968
will have to take the stand
and explain it,

02:52.002 --> 02:54.437
and when he does,
I'll get him.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.640
He'll lose it up there.

02:56.673 --> 02:59.275
You watch.

03:00.276 --> 03:02.779
â™ª (theme)

03:49.059 --> 03:53.263
(horns honking)

03:56.739 --> 04:02.400
(siren wails)

04:02.839 --> 04:05.075
BAY: Witnesses
are never objective.

04:05.108 --> 04:07.811
Of course,
I want you to appear neutral,

04:07.844 --> 04:10.747
but you need to be
every bit the advocate I am.

04:10.781 --> 04:13.750
Never forget-- your goal
is to help the prosecution

04:13.784 --> 04:15.385
secure a conviction,

04:15.418 --> 04:17.487
to put a murderer in prison.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.490
That means you're gonna have to
stand up to Bobby Donnell.

04:20.523 --> 04:22.392
You can't be steered,

04:22.425 --> 04:24.327
and he will absolutely try
to do just that.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.597
His whole defense
is reasonable doubt.

04:26.630 --> 04:29.766
Every question he asks you,
it's to build reasonable doubt.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.334
At the first trial

04:31.367 --> 04:33.770
he got you all to admit
things were possible,

04:33.804 --> 04:36.006
and you all did so
too submissively.

04:36.039 --> 04:38.875
This is why I've brought
Cindy Keller in tonight.

04:38.909 --> 04:41.477
She's our
behavioral psychologist.

04:41.511 --> 04:43.346
When the defense lawyer

04:43.379 --> 04:46.482
forces you to say the words
that he wants you to say,

04:46.516 --> 04:48.619
you can, nevertheless,

04:48.652 --> 04:51.622
use body language
to convey your opinion.

04:51.655 --> 04:53.056
It's all a presentation,

04:53.089 --> 04:55.592
and you have to
train your witnesses

04:55.626 --> 04:57.427
to be showmen a little.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.597
The key is, they can't come off
too much like advocates.

05:00.631 --> 05:03.033
If they do,
they have less credibility.

05:03.066 --> 05:06.603
We used to have an advantage.
People trusted the police.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.371
That advantage is gone now.

05:08.404 --> 05:10.506
BOBBY:
Because they cheat,

05:10.541 --> 05:13.509
and Richard Bay will cheat.
He absolutely will.

05:13.544 --> 05:15.879
That seems to be
a refrain with you.

05:15.912 --> 05:19.449
One that I have to be mindful of
the entire trial.

05:19.482 --> 05:21.618
What will be different
about this trial?

05:21.652 --> 05:23.053
I'm gonna win.

05:23.086 --> 05:25.455
I mean tactics,
evidence, witnesses.

05:25.488 --> 05:27.691
What will
be different there?

05:30.827 --> 05:33.396
That tape...

05:33.429 --> 05:35.899
that damn videotape.

05:35.932 --> 05:39.936
He'll play it
every chance he gets.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.639
HELEN: We think
you had an argument.

05:42.673 --> 05:45.842
You hit her...
maybe by accident.

05:45.876 --> 05:47.911
She was unconscious.

05:47.944 --> 05:50.947
You were afraid
of how it might look.

05:50.981 --> 05:55.418
You put her in the car to
make it look like a suicide.

05:55.451 --> 05:58.454
That's what happened,
isn't it?

06:06.129 --> 06:09.099
Detective Larson,
does that videotape

06:09.132 --> 06:12.769
fairly and accurately depict
what happened in that room?

06:12.803 --> 06:14.037
Yes, it does.

06:14.070 --> 06:16.039
What did happen in that room?

06:16.072 --> 06:17.574
From my experience,

06:17.608 --> 06:20.611
Scott Wallace admitted
to killing his wife.

06:20.644 --> 06:21.678
Objection.

06:21.712 --> 06:23.680
Overruled.

06:23.714 --> 06:26.850
Did he ever say
he killed his wife?

06:26.883 --> 06:28.885
-No, but--
-In fact, he maintained
his innocence,

06:28.919 --> 06:30.887
and he still does,
doesn't he, detective?

06:30.921 --> 06:31.955
But when confronted--

06:31.988 --> 06:33.590
When you say "admitted,"

06:33.624 --> 06:36.226
you mean the behavior
we just witnessed on this tape.

06:36.259 --> 06:38.795
-Right, detective?
-Correct.

06:38.829 --> 06:41.464
With words, he's always
maintained his innocence,

06:41.497 --> 06:42.633
hasn't he, detective?

06:42.666 --> 06:44.535
With words, yes.

06:44.568 --> 06:46.970
Are you a psychologist,
detective?

06:47.003 --> 06:48.972
No, I'm not.

06:49.005 --> 06:50.874
And if a psychologist
was of the opinion

06:50.907 --> 06:52.743
that Mr. Wallace's behavior
on that tape--

06:52.776 --> 06:55.879
Objection. He's trying
to introduce psychiatric testi--

06:55.912 --> 06:57.147
I'm posing a hypothetical
to the witness.

06:57.180 --> 06:58.682
I'll allow it.

06:58.715 --> 07:01.184
If a psychologist
was of the opinion that

07:01.217 --> 07:02.786
Mr. Wallace's breakdown
on that tape

07:02.819 --> 07:04.755
was more the product of
despondency--

07:04.788 --> 07:07.758
Your honor,
if he wants to introduce
psychiatric testimony, he--

07:07.791 --> 07:09.826
Mr. Bay, your objection
is overruled.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.729
BOBBY: Once again,

07:12.763 --> 07:15.498
if a psychologist
looked at that tape

07:15.532 --> 07:17.000
and concluded that
it did not constitute

07:17.033 --> 07:18.201
an admission to the crime,

07:18.234 --> 07:20.036
do you have
any medical training

07:20.070 --> 07:21.905
which would enable you
to overrule him?

07:21.938 --> 07:23.874
Do I have any
medical training?

07:23.907 --> 07:25.075
No. But--

07:25.108 --> 07:27.110
Thank you, detective.
That's all.

07:28.745 --> 07:30.814
How many suspects
have you interrogated

07:30.847 --> 07:32.515
in the course of your career?

07:32.549 --> 07:33.784
Hundreds.

07:33.817 --> 07:36.152
Hundreds. Do you think
you would recognize

07:36.186 --> 07:38.589
a silent admission
if you saw one?

07:38.622 --> 07:39.856
Absolutely.

07:39.890 --> 07:42.726
Based on your experience
as a police officer

07:42.759 --> 07:45.629
who has conducted
hundreds of interrogations,

07:45.662 --> 07:48.699
what did Scott Wallace's silence
convey to you?

07:48.732 --> 07:50.634
An admission
that he committed murder.

07:50.667 --> 07:53.103
Thank you.

07:53.136 --> 07:56.072
Do you have any formal training
in behavioral psychology?

07:56.106 --> 07:57.808
No, I don't.

07:57.841 --> 07:59.209
Thank you.

08:04.047 --> 08:07.584
When we first started,
it was just Bobby and me,

08:07.618 --> 08:10.020
and he was so wide-eyed--

08:10.053 --> 08:12.823
every case, his eyes--

08:12.856 --> 08:14.858
Oh, and if it was
a murder case,

08:14.891 --> 08:17.961
God, the light
coming out from his eyes...

08:17.994 --> 08:21.031
and it didn't bother him a bit
if the guy was probably guilty.

08:21.064 --> 08:23.199
He'd say,
"Bec, we defend the guilty

08:23.233 --> 08:25.301
because ultimately
it protects the innocent."

08:25.335 --> 08:27.604
Or he'd say
that was the high--

08:27.638 --> 08:31.041
You know, when you got a guy
that was actually innocent.

08:31.074 --> 08:34.778
And now he hates it
when they're innocent,

08:34.811 --> 08:36.679
like this one.

08:36.712 --> 08:38.048
It's too much pressure.

08:38.081 --> 08:40.683
That's why none of us last
on this job.

08:40.717 --> 08:44.220
You can only bear
defending the guilty.

08:44.254 --> 08:48.324
And how long can anyone last
doing that?

08:48.358 --> 08:51.862
He was screaming at her,
calling her a liar.

08:51.895 --> 08:54.364
She was pleading with him
to stop screaming.

08:54.397 --> 08:56.967
Are you sure this was
around 9:30 p. m.?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.970
Yes. That's when
I walk my dog.

09:00.003 --> 09:02.238
You recognized
my client's voice screaming

09:02.272 --> 09:04.675
because you'd heard him
scream before?

09:04.708 --> 09:06.843
-Many times.
-So there wasn't anything

09:06.877 --> 09:09.379
hugely unusual
about them arguing that night.

09:09.412 --> 09:11.682
No. They fought a lot.

09:11.715 --> 09:14.384
And, in fact, you didn't
call the police

09:14.417 --> 09:17.988
or try to intervene,
did you, sir?

09:18.021 --> 09:20.390
No.

09:20.423 --> 09:24.127
I wasn't crazy about calling
that witness in the first trial.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.062
I wasn't thrilled
about it here.

09:26.096 --> 09:28.098
But I have to establish
a time line.

09:28.131 --> 09:29.800
As a rule,

09:29.833 --> 09:32.135
when you come across anemic
little wimps like Mr. Berenson

09:32.168 --> 09:35.171
who haven't got the guts
to get involved at the time,

09:35.205 --> 09:36.807
you can be sure

09:36.840 --> 09:39.275
they'll be pretty impotent
as witnesses, too.

09:39.309 --> 09:43.947
But I needed to get in
the time line.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.416
REPORTER: Why are you so sure
he's innocent?

09:46.449 --> 09:49.686
Because I am.
I know him.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.989
Plus, he passed the polygraph.
That's what really gets me.

09:53.023 --> 09:55.425
I mean,
they may not be admissible,

09:55.458 --> 09:58.695
but lie detectors
are pretty damn reliable.

09:58.729 --> 10:00.831
And the prosecution
and the police--

10:00.864 --> 10:03.700
they believe in them
more than I do.

10:03.734 --> 10:06.970
Here we got a guy who passes
over and over and over,

10:07.003 --> 10:08.438
and they still prosecute.

10:08.471 --> 10:10.006
Why, do you think?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.275
Because the media
declared this a murder,

10:12.308 --> 10:14.745
and there was
an ensuing public outcry

10:14.778 --> 10:16.046
to get a conviction.

10:16.079 --> 10:19.215
There seems to be
such a huge distrust here.

10:19.249 --> 10:20.851
You have no idea.

10:20.884 --> 10:22.218
When I first started,

10:22.252 --> 10:24.220
the D. A. s
and defense attorneys--

10:24.254 --> 10:26.322
we'd all go out
at the end of the day.

10:26.356 --> 10:27.924
There were watering holes

10:27.958 --> 10:29.926
where we'd congregate,
swap stories.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.196
You fought hard in court,
but after, it was a--

10:33.229 --> 10:35.331
it was a brotherhood.

10:35.365 --> 10:38.201
Today we go
our separate ways.

10:38.234 --> 10:40.470
They don't trust us,
we don't trust them.

10:40.503 --> 10:42.305
What happened?

10:42.338 --> 10:47.310
It became too much
about winning and losing.

10:47.343 --> 10:49.045
We analyzed a skin fragment

10:49.079 --> 10:51.414
found under
the defendant's fingernail.

10:51.447 --> 10:54.050
It was a genetic match
to Mrs. Wallace.

10:54.084 --> 10:57.053
Did you do any other
DNA testing, Dr. Wang?

10:57.087 --> 10:58.955
Oh, yes.
We found shed skin cells

10:58.989 --> 11:01.057
all over the victim's
head and neck.

11:01.091 --> 11:04.227
They belong to the defendant
Scott Wallace.

11:04.260 --> 11:07.831
If Scott Wallace were trying
to save his wife,

11:07.864 --> 11:09.099
resuscitate her,

11:09.132 --> 11:11.234
it's possible his skin cells

11:11.267 --> 11:13.837
could have gotten on her
that way, am I right?

11:13.870 --> 11:16.439
In my experience,
that would be unlikely.

11:16.472 --> 11:19.242
I asked if it were possible.

11:19.275 --> 11:21.845
I suppose it's possible.

11:21.878 --> 11:23.847
And it's possible,
isn't it, doctor,

11:23.880 --> 11:25.248
that Mrs. Wallace had decided

11:25.281 --> 11:27.183
she wanted to compete
in the Olympics,

11:27.217 --> 11:29.019
and while practicing
a back flip,

11:29.052 --> 11:31.021
she accidentally hit her head
on a blunt instrument

11:31.054 --> 11:33.023
-being held by the defendant?
-Objection!

11:33.056 --> 11:35.291
As long as we're going
for far-fetched possibilities...

11:35.325 --> 11:36.459
Move to strike!

11:36.492 --> 11:37.861
Mr. Bay,
that is quite enough.

11:39.062 --> 11:40.263
Dr. Wang,

11:40.296 --> 11:42.465
based on your years
of experience

11:42.498 --> 11:45.936
as a forensic pathologist,
did you form an opinion

11:45.969 --> 11:48.304
as to the likelihood
of what happened?

11:48.338 --> 11:49.940
Yes, I did.

11:49.973 --> 11:52.275
Could you state that
for the court, please?

11:52.308 --> 11:54.845
She was killed
by the defendant.

11:54.878 --> 11:56.279
The defense has suggested

11:56.312 --> 11:58.481
Mr. Wallace
discovered his wife in the car,

11:58.514 --> 12:00.884
she wasn't breathing,
he pulled her out,

12:00.917 --> 12:03.053
and her head struck
the concrete floor,

12:03.086 --> 12:04.420
causing the fracture.

12:04.454 --> 12:07.323
Yes, I think this is
a bit of a fairy tale.

12:07.357 --> 12:10.160
The fracture--
she was hit very hard.

12:10.193 --> 12:12.295
Is it possible that she
could have gotten this

12:12.328 --> 12:14.497
after she died
by her head hitting the floor?

12:14.530 --> 12:16.132
Anything's possible.

12:16.166 --> 12:19.069
My medical opinion
is somebody hit her.

12:19.102 --> 12:21.137
Doctor, in the first trial,

12:21.171 --> 12:24.440
you testified that this fracture
was severe enough to be fatal.

12:24.474 --> 12:25.976
Didn't you say that?

12:26.009 --> 12:26.977
I did.

12:27.010 --> 12:28.979
Was it the cause of death?

12:29.012 --> 12:31.582
No, the cause of death
was monoxide poisoning.

12:31.615 --> 12:34.150
So it's possible
that the head fracture

12:34.184 --> 12:37.087
came after she died
of the car exhaust, right?

12:37.120 --> 12:38.822
That's not
what I think happened,

12:38.855 --> 12:40.824
but I can't declare it
to be impossible.

12:40.857 --> 12:42.993
Doctor, you're employed by
the commonwealth, aren't you?

12:43.026 --> 12:45.061
-Yes.
-Do you ever get afraid
of losing your job

12:45.095 --> 12:46.563
if you don't secure
convictions--

12:46.597 --> 12:47.964
-Objection!
-Sustained.

12:47.998 --> 12:49.365
BOBBY: Goes to bias,
your honor.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.434
The objection is sustained.
That's it!

12:51.467 --> 12:53.837
Now let's move on.

12:53.870 --> 12:55.839
It's what he does
when he's losing.

12:55.872 --> 12:58.274
It's an excellent sign
for the prosecution

12:58.308 --> 13:01.277
when Bobby Donnell starts
to resort to crap like that.

13:01.311 --> 13:03.246
It means
he thinks he's losing.

13:03.279 --> 13:04.848
In the first trial,

13:04.881 --> 13:07.117
he was getting his possibles,
then resting.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.119
He was more desperate
just then.

13:09.152 --> 13:11.555
Did you see it?

13:11.588 --> 13:13.557
He's going down again...

13:13.590 --> 13:17.393
this time with nothing
to appeal.

13:22.232 --> 13:27.203
You know, I keep thinking
it'll all get corrected.

13:27.237 --> 13:30.941
They've made
this terrible mistake,

13:30.974 --> 13:33.443
and this is the land
of truth and justice,

13:33.476 --> 13:35.946
it'll all get cleared up.

13:35.979 --> 13:38.481
But here I am.

13:38.514 --> 13:42.485
REPORTER: The thinking is
for you to get acquitted,

13:42.518 --> 13:45.488
it'll come down
to your testimony.

13:45.521 --> 13:47.457
Yeah, I know this.

13:47.490 --> 13:49.325
I know this.

13:51.327 --> 13:53.329
Are you scared?

13:56.066 --> 13:59.469
It's way beyond that now.

13:59.502 --> 14:01.471
BOBBY:
I think that's enough.

14:01.504 --> 14:03.574
REPORTER: The arrangement
is complete access.

14:03.607 --> 14:06.042
Well, that's all.
You'll have to leave.

14:06.076 --> 14:07.443
Bobby, Kyle Barrett
isn't testifying.

14:07.477 --> 14:09.245
Why?

14:09.279 --> 14:11.147
Bay just notified the court
they're resting. We're up.

14:11.181 --> 14:12.182
Well, call Dr. Murphy.
He's going to--

14:12.215 --> 14:13.483
I did.
He's on his way.

14:13.516 --> 14:15.351
Why isn't her brother
testifying?

14:15.385 --> 14:17.353
I don't need him.

14:17.387 --> 14:19.022
Plus, he'd get peeled
like an onion up there.

14:19.055 --> 14:20.523
He's a liability.

14:20.557 --> 14:22.959
REPORTER:
I thought you said
he was telling the truth.

14:22.993 --> 14:24.260
I never said that.

14:24.294 --> 14:26.262
I only said I don't know
if he's lying.

14:26.296 --> 14:28.532
That sounds
a little questionable.

14:28.565 --> 14:30.701
Hey, question away.

14:30.734 --> 14:33.704
I only put on the witnesses
I think will help me win.

14:33.737 --> 14:35.471
Kyle Barrett doesn't qualify.

14:35.505 --> 14:37.107
But this is the witness

14:37.140 --> 14:39.075
who got you the conviction
in the first trial.

14:39.109 --> 14:41.545
In the first trial,
I didn't have the video.

14:41.578 --> 14:44.314
Scott Wallace was suffering
from clinical depression.

14:44.347 --> 14:47.117
Were you able to determine
the cause, doctor?

14:47.150 --> 14:48.585
Twin positional traumas.

14:48.619 --> 14:50.954
The first
was his wife's death.

14:50.987 --> 14:53.957
The second, his being accused
of that death.

14:53.990 --> 14:55.391
Doctor, you recommended

14:55.425 --> 14:58.428
that Scott Wallace
be hospitalized, did you not?

14:58.461 --> 14:59.429
I did.

14:59.462 --> 15:00.964
Can you tell us why?

15:00.997 --> 15:02.966
I found him
to be very close

15:02.999 --> 15:04.968
to a complete
mental breakdown.

15:05.001 --> 15:06.603
Doctor, you've seen
this tape before.

15:06.637 --> 15:09.606
I want to play you
a small portion again.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.676
HELEN:
...look like a suicide.

15:12.709 --> 15:16.947
That's what happened,
isn't it?

15:19.616 --> 15:22.418
You've heard the prosecution
characterize that moment

15:22.452 --> 15:25.689
as an admission of guilt
by Scott Wallace.

15:25.722 --> 15:27.624
I think that conclusion

15:27.658 --> 15:29.525
is as dangerous
as it is absurd.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.262
He'd only just discovered
within the last two hours

15:32.295 --> 15:33.697
that his wife was dead,

15:33.730 --> 15:35.999
then he's taken down
to the police station,

15:36.032 --> 15:38.468
he's hit with the accusation
that he murdered her.

15:38.501 --> 15:41.171
To a guilty man, that wouldn't
be as much of a shock,

15:41.204 --> 15:43.173
but to an innocent one,

15:43.206 --> 15:45.008
that could cause the very trauma
I'm talking about.

15:45.041 --> 15:46.276
And when he dropped
his head...

15:46.309 --> 15:47.644
It was in shock.

15:47.678 --> 15:52.315
That was likely
the beginning of his breakdown.

15:52.348 --> 15:54.450
You can state that
for a medical certainty?

15:54.484 --> 15:56.152
No, but--

15:56.186 --> 15:58.388
And you were not in the room
at the time, were you, doctor?

15:58.421 --> 16:00.056
No, I was not.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.559
But if that makes me
incapable of drawing
a conclusion

16:02.593 --> 16:04.595
on the basis of
the video tape,

16:04.628 --> 16:06.329
why are you asking the jury
to do so?

16:06.362 --> 16:08.732
You spoke of
twin positional traumas,

16:08.765 --> 16:11.267
one of those traumas being
the loss of his wife.

16:11.301 --> 16:13.169
Yes?

16:13.203 --> 16:14.705
For this to be so,

16:14.738 --> 16:17.173
he would have to have loved
his wife very deeply, I assume.

16:17.207 --> 16:19.075
And he did,
from my observations.

16:19.109 --> 16:21.244
Well, if this wife
who he loved deeply

16:21.277 --> 16:23.113
told him
she was leaving him,

16:23.146 --> 16:26.082
-couldn't that be traumatic?
-Certainly.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.051
Is it possible that's when
this mental breakdown started--

16:28.084 --> 16:29.720
when she said
she was leaving him?

16:29.753 --> 16:32.188
I suppose it's possible,
but I don't think likely.

16:32.222 --> 16:34.290
Doctor, according
to your diagnosis,

16:34.324 --> 16:35.726
you said Scott Wallace

16:35.759 --> 16:38.394
was in danger of becoming
psychotic, didn't you?

16:38.428 --> 16:41.131
He never became psychotic,
Mr. Bay.

16:45.101 --> 16:47.437
Sometimes when you get
a tough witness,

16:47.470 --> 16:50.440
you take what you can get
and sit the hell down.

16:50.473 --> 16:52.175
I thought I handled him well.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.344
REPORTER: And now you have
the victim's psychiatrist.

16:54.377 --> 16:55.712
I'm not afraid of him.

16:55.746 --> 16:57.347
How can you not be?

16:57.380 --> 16:59.282
He's going to testify
that she was depressed.

16:59.315 --> 17:01.284
He'll say depressed,
then on cross,

17:01.317 --> 17:04.487
I'll get him to say
she wasn't suicidal,
then on redirect,

17:04.520 --> 17:07.190
Bobby will claim he has motive
to say she wasn't suicidal

17:07.223 --> 17:09.626
so he doesn't have her blood
on his hands.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.294
It's vintage Bobby Donnell.

17:11.327 --> 17:12.663
He gets a witness to help him,
then he hangs him out.

17:12.695 --> 17:14.130
You watch.

17:14.164 --> 17:16.132
You seem a little more
agitated now.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.134
I'm not agitated.
This is adrenaline.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.836
It's a fight. This--

17:19.869 --> 17:21.605
I'm not agitated.

17:21.637 --> 17:24.608
My little informal poll
in the gallery--

17:24.641 --> 17:26.676
they think you're losing.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.310
I'm not losing.

17:28.344 --> 17:30.313
Why would people
think you are?

17:30.346 --> 17:32.616
Because with galleries,
it's about popularity.

17:32.649 --> 17:34.585
Bobby Donnell
is good-looking.

17:34.618 --> 17:37.153
With juries,
it's about weighing evidence,

17:37.187 --> 17:38.889
and they'll do that.

17:38.922 --> 17:41.291
I'm not losing.

17:42.659 --> 17:45.195
What were you
treating Karen Wallace for?

17:45.228 --> 17:46.730
Anxiety, depression.

17:46.763 --> 17:48.131
Depression?

17:48.164 --> 17:49.299
Yes.

17:49.332 --> 17:51.301
What was she
depressed over?

17:51.334 --> 17:52.836
Mainly her marriage.

17:52.869 --> 17:55.205
She felt
it was rather loveless.

17:55.238 --> 17:56.907
Also her life.

17:56.940 --> 17:59.375
Did you regard her
as suicidal?

17:59.409 --> 18:00.777
No, I did not.

18:00.811 --> 18:03.379
But, doctor, now that
she's turned up dead,

18:03.413 --> 18:06.249
do you now think
perhaps she was suicidal?

18:06.282 --> 18:08.384
No, I do not.

18:08.418 --> 18:11.221
Many people experience
depression and hopelessness.

18:11.254 --> 18:13.523
That doesn't mean
they take their lives.

18:13.557 --> 18:16.526
I mean, the very reason that
Mrs. Wallace had come to me

18:16.560 --> 18:19.162
was to improve things.
She was looking forward.

18:19.195 --> 18:21.164
I don't believe at all
that she had the mental state

18:21.197 --> 18:22.666
to take her own life.

18:22.699 --> 18:24.668
How did it make you feel

18:24.701 --> 18:27.671
to learn that a patient you
had been treating for depression

18:27.704 --> 18:29.339
killed herself?

18:29.372 --> 18:31.542
Obviously, it was
distressing to hear it.

18:31.575 --> 18:34.177
Certainly a person
experiencing hopelessness,

18:34.210 --> 18:36.547
suffering depression,
found dead from
monoxide poisoning

18:36.580 --> 18:40.183
with a hose connected to
the exhaust pipe of the car--

18:40.216 --> 18:43.554
you had to wonder
if maybe she did kill herself.

18:43.587 --> 18:45.956
Didn't you
at least wonder, doctor?

18:45.989 --> 18:47.691
I wondered,

18:47.724 --> 18:50.293
but I still don't believe
she took her life.

18:50.326 --> 18:52.495
Well, if it were foreseeable
that she might take her life

18:52.528 --> 18:53.964
and you did nothing,

18:53.997 --> 18:56.366
you might be held liable,
isn't that right, doctor?

18:56.399 --> 18:58.902
What are you saying,
Mr. Donnell?

18:58.935 --> 19:01.805
I'm saying you have motive
to deny she was suicidal.

19:01.838 --> 19:03.439
Objection-- leading.

19:03.473 --> 19:05.542
After she's found dead,
you don't even

19:05.576 --> 19:07.811
notify the police
that you were treating her?

19:07.844 --> 19:09.813
-No.
-What were you
trying to hide?

19:09.846 --> 19:11.748
-Objection.
-Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

19:11.782 --> 19:13.750
-Objection.
-Overruled.

19:13.784 --> 19:14.985
Why not come forward
to anybody and say,

19:15.018 --> 19:17.220
"Hey, I was treating her"?

19:17.253 --> 19:18.722
-There's a privilege.
-Which does not survive
the patient's death.

19:18.755 --> 19:20.390
You were trying
to hide the fact

19:20.423 --> 19:21.825
that you were treating her

19:21.858 --> 19:23.560
because you knew she was
potentially suicidal.

19:23.594 --> 19:25.295
Objection!
It's argumentative...

19:25.328 --> 19:27.497
I knew nothing of the sort.
Mrs. Wallace--

19:27.530 --> 19:29.499
-Your honor --
-Just like you are now.
You let this man go down...

19:29.533 --> 19:31.301
because you were afraid
of being hit with a judgment.

19:31.334 --> 19:34.605
All right!
Mr. Donnell, dial it back.

19:37.874 --> 19:39.576
REPORTER: Did you tell
that witness

19:39.610 --> 19:41.578
you would be
going after him like that?

19:41.612 --> 19:43.246
-No.
-Because...

19:43.279 --> 19:45.949
Because I needed him, and he
never would have cooperated

19:45.982 --> 19:47.584
knowing what he was in for.

19:47.618 --> 19:49.385
Why didn't you just call him
as a hostile witness

19:49.419 --> 19:50.921
to begin with?

19:50.954 --> 19:53.824
Because I knew I'd get more
out of him this way.

19:53.857 --> 19:56.392
First as an ally
and then blind-siding him?

19:56.426 --> 19:59.295
I don't think
I blind-sided him, but...yes.

19:59.329 --> 20:01.397
Don't you think
that perpetuates

20:01.431 --> 20:03.567
the very distrust
you spoke of before

20:03.600 --> 20:05.702
between D. A. s
and defense attorneys?

20:05.736 --> 20:07.771
My goal here isn't
to repair trust.

20:07.804 --> 20:09.773
It's to get an acquittal.

20:09.806 --> 20:12.609
And you're comfortable
with yourself?

20:12.643 --> 20:14.745
Yes.

20:15.979 --> 20:16.980
ELLENOR: The truth is,

20:17.013 --> 20:18.615
he isn't comfortable,

20:18.649 --> 20:22.285
and when he and Lindsay
have this baby,

20:22.318 --> 20:24.655
it's going to be
the beginning of the end

20:24.688 --> 20:26.657
of his criminal defense
days.

20:26.690 --> 20:28.925
REPORTER: Why?

20:28.959 --> 20:32.829
Because with Bobby,
this job is who he is,

20:32.863 --> 20:35.398
and when he starts
to see himself

20:35.431 --> 20:40.303
through his son's eyes
or his daughter's eyes,

20:40.336 --> 20:42.706
forget it. It's over.

20:45.576 --> 20:47.911
It's gone as well as
we could have expected.

20:47.944 --> 20:50.547
That videotape is still
the biggest piece of evidence,

20:50.581 --> 20:52.916
and you'll have
to account for it.

20:52.949 --> 20:54.551
I understand.

20:54.585 --> 20:56.853
Just tell the truth,
Scott.

20:56.887 --> 20:59.422
The truth is
on our side here.

20:59.455 --> 21:01.457
Yeah.

21:01.491 --> 21:03.694
Uh, you want to go over
my testimony again or...

21:03.727 --> 21:05.696
Actually, I prefer not to.

21:05.729 --> 21:08.364
I don't want it
coming off rehearsed.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.703
Now, Richard Bay--

21:12.736 --> 21:15.438
he's going to come at you
all rabid.

21:15.471 --> 21:16.873
That's his style.

21:16.907 --> 21:19.876
I can protect you,
but I prefer not to.

21:19.910 --> 21:21.444
I can handle him.

21:21.477 --> 21:22.846
Lastly,

21:22.879 --> 21:24.848
your anger
towards your wife

21:24.881 --> 21:26.850
for what she did to you--

21:26.883 --> 21:28.852
let's play that down
tomorrow.

21:28.885 --> 21:31.622
We don't want them
seeing anger.

21:31.655 --> 21:33.023
Okay.

21:36.392 --> 21:38.629
You all right, Scott?

21:38.662 --> 21:40.463
I'm nervous.

21:40.496 --> 21:42.766
Other than that...

21:50.674 --> 21:53.644
REPORTER: You look scared.

21:53.677 --> 21:57.380
This has been
a long haul.

21:57.413 --> 22:01.752
Have you seen any good
appeal issues so far?

22:01.785 --> 22:04.020
No.

22:04.054 --> 22:06.657
That's the thing
about Judge Hiller.

22:06.690 --> 22:09.392
Her trials
don't get overturned.

22:09.425 --> 22:12.663
So basically
if you don't win here,

22:12.696 --> 22:15.732
Scott Wallace
is never coming out.

22:28.257 --> 22:29.199
REPORTER:
Were you surprised

22:29.231 --> 22:30.614
Bobby said yes
to the cameras?

22:30.647 --> 22:33.016
Not really. If he loses,
he hopes you catch

22:33.049 --> 22:35.018
some prosecutorial misconduct
on tape,

22:35.051 --> 22:36.853
give him grounds for appeal.

22:36.887 --> 22:38.622
What if he wins,

22:38.655 --> 22:41.024
and Richard Bay spots
misconduct on Bobby's part?

22:41.057 --> 22:42.626
Doesn't matter.
Double jeopardy.

22:42.659 --> 22:45.495
Not guilty is not guilty.

22:45.528 --> 22:48.532
(reporters shouting questions)

22:52.903 --> 22:53.970
No comment.

22:54.004 --> 22:55.706
Bay's got
the monitors set up.

22:55.739 --> 22:56.740
It looks like he plans
to show the tape again.

22:56.773 --> 22:58.141
What a shock.
You tell Scott?

22:58.174 --> 23:00.043
He's ready.

23:00.076 --> 23:03.046
SCOTT: She just announced
that she planned to leave me.

23:03.079 --> 23:05.048
BOBBY: Did you see
this coming?

23:05.081 --> 23:07.618
Not at all.
We'd had our problems,

23:07.651 --> 23:09.620
and I knew
she was unhappy,

23:09.653 --> 23:12.022
but I never expected her
to walk out.

23:12.055 --> 23:14.124
Did you want
to stay married?

23:14.157 --> 23:18.595
Yes. I asked if we could
get therapy.

23:18.629 --> 23:20.597
She said it was too late.

23:20.631 --> 23:22.498
She'd already made up
her mind,

23:22.533 --> 23:26.236
and she said that she wanted
to live life without me.

23:26.269 --> 23:29.540
She, uh, she said
it had been years

23:29.573 --> 23:33.644
since she felt the slightest
twinge of happiness with me.

23:33.677 --> 23:36.046
I mean, that was
how she put it--

23:36.079 --> 23:38.181
"the slightest twinge,"

23:38.214 --> 23:41.084
and she said she wanted out.

23:41.117 --> 23:42.786
And then what happened?

23:42.819 --> 23:44.520
We argued.

23:44.555 --> 23:48.959
Uh, we engaged
in some name-calling.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.161
Did you call her a liar?

23:51.194 --> 23:54.698
Among other things, yeah.

23:54.731 --> 23:57.067
Then I went upstairs
to the bedroom,

23:57.100 --> 23:59.903
got ready for bed,
and watched TV.

23:59.936 --> 24:01.905
Your wife tells you
she's leaving you,

24:01.938 --> 24:03.506
and you watch television?

24:03.540 --> 24:05.241
Well, I had hoped
that when she came up

24:05.275 --> 24:07.510
after things calmed down
a little bit,

24:07.544 --> 24:10.947
that I could, you know,
maybe talk her out of it.

24:10.981 --> 24:12.515
So what happened?

24:12.549 --> 24:14.150
Well, I waited.

24:14.184 --> 24:16.152
After about an hour
and a half,

24:16.186 --> 24:18.689
she still hadn't
come up,

24:18.722 --> 24:21.057
so I figured
she'd probably had a drink

24:21.091 --> 24:23.694
and decided to sleep
on the couch.

24:23.727 --> 24:27.230
So I went down and, uh,
she wasn't there.

24:27.263 --> 24:29.800
I thought, well,
maybe she left,

24:29.833 --> 24:33.537
but I thought I would have
heard the car pull out.

24:33.570 --> 24:38.241
So, uh, I went to check,

24:38.274 --> 24:39.876
and, uh,

24:39.910 --> 24:45.816
uh, when I opened the door
to the garage,

24:45.849 --> 24:48.819
uh, I just smelled
the exhaust,

24:48.852 --> 24:51.555
and it was all smoky in there.

24:51.588 --> 24:54.558
And then what?

24:54.591 --> 24:55.992
I went in,

24:56.026 --> 24:58.995
and, uh, I had to open
the garage door

24:59.029 --> 25:01.565
because I couldn't
breathe the exhaust,

25:01.598 --> 25:06.603
and, uh, and I saw
the hose.

25:11.975 --> 25:13.076
Mr. Wallace?

25:13.109 --> 25:15.078
It was a garden hose.

25:15.111 --> 25:17.748
It was taped
to the exhaust

25:17.781 --> 25:20.283
at the exhaust pipe
of the car,

25:20.316 --> 25:23.587
and, uh, the car
was running,

25:23.620 --> 25:28.592
and it-- the hose
went into the front window.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.594
What did you do then?

25:30.627 --> 25:32.696
I ran to the car.

25:32.729 --> 25:35.098
I opened the door,
and there she was.

25:35.131 --> 25:38.769
She, uh, her head was back
and her eyes were closed,

25:38.802 --> 25:41.705
and she wasn't breathing.

25:41.738 --> 25:44.040
It looked like
she was sleeping.

25:44.074 --> 25:49.613
Uh, I screamed "Karen"
and I shook her.

25:49.646 --> 25:52.048
She wouldn't wake up,
and I pulled her out.

25:52.082 --> 25:55.619
She fell,

25:55.652 --> 26:00.156
and, uh, I tried giving her
mouth-to-mouth

26:00.190 --> 26:02.793
and chest compressions,
but she wasn't breathing.

26:02.826 --> 26:05.629
She didn't have a pulse.

26:05.662 --> 26:10.066
I, uh,

26:10.100 --> 26:14.270
kept, uh, you know,
holding her nose closed

26:14.304 --> 26:16.907
and trying to blow air
into her lungs,

26:16.940 --> 26:19.109
but she wouldn't come back.

26:20.844 --> 26:23.346
She wouldn't come back.

26:23.379 --> 26:25.882
And when the police
arrived,

26:25.916 --> 26:28.018
did you tell them
all this?

26:28.051 --> 26:29.252
Yeah, yeah.

26:29.285 --> 26:33.657
Uh, they asked me
to come to the station.

26:33.690 --> 26:35.659
Scott, on that videotape,

26:35.692 --> 26:39.930
when they accused you
of killing Karen,

26:39.963 --> 26:43.199
why didn't you deny it?

26:43.233 --> 26:48.304
I don't think I could believe
what I was even hearing.

26:48.338 --> 26:52.208
I mean, I, uh, I still
couldn't believe she was dead,

26:52.242 --> 26:57.113
and then some district attorney
was saying that I killed her?

26:57.147 --> 26:59.950
I remember feeling nauseous,

26:59.983 --> 27:02.919
like I was gonna black out.

27:02.953 --> 27:05.321
I'm going to give you
another chance

27:05.355 --> 27:07.891
to answer that question.

27:10.426 --> 27:13.930
Did you kill your wife?

27:13.964 --> 27:16.432
No.

27:21.304 --> 27:22.873
I'm sorry.

27:22.906 --> 27:25.876
It's just for a--
for six months,

27:25.909 --> 27:29.846
you have been asking me
not to speak to anyone,

27:29.880 --> 27:31.314
and I never have,

27:31.347 --> 27:37.153
and I've waited for this day
to come before everyone

27:37.187 --> 27:42.726
and finally say
I didn't kill her.

27:42.759 --> 27:46.029
I did not commit
any crime.

27:51.535 --> 27:53.036
Thank you.

28:14.324 --> 28:15.926
You're
an investment banker.

28:15.959 --> 28:17.828
Is that correct,
Mr. Wallace?

28:17.861 --> 28:19.129
Yes, that's right.

28:19.162 --> 28:20.764
In the month or so

28:20.797 --> 28:22.766
prior to your wife's
sudden death,

28:22.799 --> 28:25.201
how were things
going for you at work?

28:25.235 --> 28:27.203
It had--
it had been rough.

28:27.237 --> 28:29.305
The market was off.

28:29.339 --> 28:32.042
Had you been told
you might be let go?

28:32.075 --> 28:34.410
Well, my firm
was scaling back, yes.

28:34.444 --> 28:37.013
I was told that
my position was tenuous.

28:37.047 --> 28:40.551
How about your own
personal assets?

28:40.584 --> 28:42.553
You suffered some losses,
hadn't you?

28:42.586 --> 28:45.021
A few, yes.

28:45.055 --> 28:47.023
At the time
of your wife's sudden death

28:47.057 --> 28:48.892
you were nearly broke,
weren't you, sir?

28:48.925 --> 28:51.161
Well, I would hardly say
I was broke, Mr. Bay.

28:51.194 --> 28:53.063
I did live in
a million-dollar house.

28:53.096 --> 28:54.865
Fully paid for?

28:54.898 --> 28:57.300
No. We had a mortgage
of about $400,000.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.235
Any other assets?

28:59.269 --> 29:02.573
Uh, my savings,
some stocks.

29:02.606 --> 29:05.308
Totaling more or less
than $50,000

29:05.341 --> 29:08.511
at the time of your wife's
sudden death?

29:08.545 --> 29:11.081
At the exact time, less,
but stocks have a--

29:11.114 --> 29:12.515
Thank you, sir.

29:12.549 --> 29:15.085
So at the time
of your wife's sudden death,

29:15.118 --> 29:17.888
your assets totaled
about $650,000.

29:17.921 --> 29:20.323
A divorce would have
cut that in half.

29:20.356 --> 29:22.893
Add to that attorney fees
plus alimony,

29:22.926 --> 29:24.828
plus you were looking
at unemployment.

29:24.861 --> 29:27.530
Did you have a life insurance
policy on your wife

29:27.564 --> 29:29.365
at the time
of her sudden death?

29:29.399 --> 29:31.201
-Objection.
-JUDGE HILLER: Overruled.

29:31.234 --> 29:32.936
Did you, sir?

29:32.969 --> 29:35.539
There were life insurance
policies for both of us.

29:35.572 --> 29:37.541
The policy was to pay you
over $1 million

29:37.574 --> 29:39.543
in the event of her death.
Isn't that correct?

29:39.576 --> 29:41.612
Yes.

29:41.645 --> 29:44.014
When did you renew
that policy, sir?

29:44.047 --> 29:45.381
We both renewed them--

29:45.415 --> 29:48.018
When did you both renew
that policy?

29:48.051 --> 29:50.220
Oh, I think it was
around May.

29:50.253 --> 29:54.024
Approximately a month
before her sudden death.

29:54.057 --> 29:57.293
Did you kill your wife
for money, sir?

29:57.327 --> 29:58.862
No, I did not.

29:58.895 --> 30:01.364
Gee, you seem capable
of denying it now.

30:01.397 --> 30:03.499
-Objection.
-Sustained.

30:03.534 --> 30:05.135
You've got a suicidal woman
on your hands.

30:05.168 --> 30:06.637
You get into a big fight,

30:06.670 --> 30:08.471
and you go upstairs
and watch television?

30:08.504 --> 30:10.473
Well, I didn't know
she was on the verge

30:10.506 --> 30:11.975
of taking her life,

30:12.008 --> 30:13.409
and, hey, I was angry
that night, too.

30:13.443 --> 30:14.978
-Angry enough
to kill her?
-No.

30:15.011 --> 30:16.512
Angry enough to have
a mental breakdown?

30:16.547 --> 30:19.249
Angry enough to have
a mental breakdown, sir?

30:19.282 --> 30:21.985
Objection. Calls for
a medical opinion.

30:22.018 --> 30:23.519
I'll put it
in layman's terms.

30:23.554 --> 30:26.389
-Angry enough to snap?
-No.

30:26.422 --> 30:28.391
You're about
to lose your job.

30:28.424 --> 30:30.226
You've already lost
your money.

30:30.260 --> 30:32.062
Now you're hit with losing
your wife, your house.

30:32.095 --> 30:33.964
You weren't going to let that
happen, were you, Mr. Wallace?

30:33.997 --> 30:35.666
-But that's not
the way it happened.
-You snapped.

30:35.699 --> 30:38.001
-I did not.
-You hit her
from behind.

30:38.034 --> 30:40.070
-I never hit my wife.
-You cracked when you
knew you were caught.

30:40.103 --> 30:41.137
-I didn't.
I did no such thing.
-We saw the tape.

30:41.171 --> 30:42.138
I explained--

30:42.172 --> 30:43.674
You killed your wife--

30:43.707 --> 30:45.175
I did not!

30:50.446 --> 30:53.016
Are you about to get
violent, Mr. Wallace?

30:53.049 --> 30:54.017
BOTH: Objection!

30:54.050 --> 30:56.086
Withdrawn.

30:56.119 --> 30:57.554
Nothing further.

30:59.956 --> 31:02.158
BOBBY: Chambers,
your honor.

31:02.192 --> 31:03.159
It's bad faith.

31:03.193 --> 31:04.260
-Why?
-Bad faith?

31:04.294 --> 31:05.495
Never, ever
in the first trial

31:05.528 --> 31:07.030
did they suggest
financial gain as motive.

31:07.063 --> 31:08.531
None of the police ever
said it. Now suddenly--

31:08.565 --> 31:09.533
So what?

31:09.566 --> 31:11.167
You decide on a new motive

31:11.201 --> 31:12.435
between the first
and the second trial.

31:12.468 --> 31:14.104
Why can't I?

31:14.137 --> 31:15.939
Without any new evidence
that amounts to unfair surprise.

31:15.972 --> 31:17.373
You got to be kidding me!

31:17.407 --> 31:19.209
You can't just fabricate
a new motive.

31:19.242 --> 31:20.944
All right. Bobby, there is
nothing to prevent

31:20.977 --> 31:22.445
the prosecution
from changing strategies.

31:22.478 --> 31:24.047
At a minimum, it's bad faith.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.949
If he truly believes
that money was a motive,

31:25.982 --> 31:27.951
they would have argued it
in the first trial.

31:27.984 --> 31:29.953
I didn't try the first one.
Helen Gamble did.

31:29.986 --> 31:31.221
Oh, come on, Richard.

31:31.254 --> 31:32.723
What are you asking for?

31:32.756 --> 31:35.225
The commonwealth does not have
a good faith belief

31:35.258 --> 31:37.227
in its motive theory,
and to spring it

31:37.260 --> 31:39.663
at a second trial
constitutes unfair surprise,

31:39.696 --> 31:41.598
and I'm asking
that it be stricken.

31:41.632 --> 31:43.734
-Forget it.
-Your honor--

31:43.767 --> 31:45.669
Don't even waste
my time, Bobby.

31:45.702 --> 31:48.572
You don't know what Mr. Bay
does or does not believe.

31:48.605 --> 31:51.642
They are not bound by
the strategy of the first trial.

31:51.675 --> 31:53.644
REPORTER:
Do you believe it--

31:53.677 --> 31:55.646
that he killed her
for money?

31:55.679 --> 31:57.648
I certainly don't know
that he didn't.

31:57.681 --> 31:59.282
That wasn't my question.

31:59.315 --> 32:01.284
You're not asking
a question.

32:01.317 --> 32:04.287
You're making an accusation,
and I'm getting sick of it.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.289
The idea of giving you
access was to let you observe.

32:06.322 --> 32:08.224
It wasn't for you
to charge in here with opinions.

32:08.258 --> 32:09.993
Was I doing that?

32:10.026 --> 32:12.763
Yes, you've been doing that,
and I'm getting fed up.

32:12.796 --> 32:14.765
You want to point
your damn cameras, fine,

32:14.798 --> 32:18.334
but enough
with the judgments.

32:18.368 --> 32:21.572
REPORTER: What are you
thinking right now?

32:21.605 --> 32:24.541
I'm thinking this is why
you shouldn't represent people

32:24.575 --> 32:27.544
you feel emotionally--

32:27.578 --> 32:29.445
family members, friends.

32:29.479 --> 32:32.015
The best legal advice
you can give them

32:32.048 --> 32:34.017
is to hire somebody else.

32:34.050 --> 32:37.287
You think you've tried
a bad case again?

32:37.320 --> 32:40.456
I was caught off-guard
with motive.

32:40.490 --> 32:43.459
I let the jury
see me angry with a witness.

32:43.493 --> 32:44.761
I...

32:47.230 --> 32:50.200
Yeah.

32:50.233 --> 32:51.568
I made some mistakes.

32:51.602 --> 32:53.203
I don't agree.

32:53.236 --> 32:55.471
What do you think,
Lindsay?

32:55.505 --> 32:58.575
I think it's pretty even,

32:58.609 --> 33:01.578
and ties go to the defendants
in this business.

33:01.612 --> 33:04.480
Bobby closes a lot better
than Richard Bay.

33:04.514 --> 33:06.216
This isn't over.

33:06.249 --> 33:08.484
The question I have--

33:08.518 --> 33:12.756
you have a client charged
with a violent, angry crime.

33:12.789 --> 33:16.492
You told him
not to flash anger.

33:16.526 --> 33:18.528
What happened?

33:25.101 --> 33:27.170
I don't know.

33:43.687 --> 33:45.789
When I first became a lawyer,

33:45.822 --> 33:49.392
I used to call my mother
and tell her about my cases.

33:49.425 --> 33:53.664
I'd explain all the intricacies,
and she'd get bored

33:53.697 --> 33:56.166
and snap at me,
"Just nutshell the damn thing."

33:56.199 --> 33:58.769
And I discovered
when I did nutshell,

33:58.802 --> 34:01.337
most of those cases
which I thought

34:01.371 --> 34:06.376
were so complicated
were actually quite simple.

34:06.409 --> 34:10.246
The nutshell on this one--

34:10.280 --> 34:16.119
man in financial trouble
renews insurance policy on wife.

34:16.152 --> 34:19.121
She announces
she's leaving him.

34:19.155 --> 34:23.560
She's found dead with a whack
on the back of the head.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.562
That pretty much says it all.

34:25.596 --> 34:30.466
In the way of proof,
there's certainly a lot more.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.835
All the DNA evidence
points to him.

34:32.869 --> 34:35.405
Not most of it-- all.

34:35.438 --> 34:38.408
Her skin found
under his fingernails,

34:38.440 --> 34:42.679
his skin cells and prints
found on her head and neck.

34:42.713 --> 34:45.380
His admission caught right
on videotape,

34:45.415 --> 34:49.853
his anger displayed
right here on the stand.

34:49.886 --> 34:52.556
His own treating psychiatrist
diagnosed him

34:52.589 --> 34:55.324
borderline psychotic.

34:56.592 --> 35:00.564
She didn't commit suicide.

35:00.597 --> 35:03.834
The psychiatrist who was
treating Karen Wallace--

35:03.867 --> 35:07.437
he told you
she wasn't suicidal.

35:07.470 --> 35:11.708
This woman was murdered.

35:11.742 --> 35:14.444
All the evidence tells you so,

35:14.477 --> 35:18.849
and Scott Wallace...

35:18.882 --> 35:20.851
HELEN: You put her
in the car

35:20.884 --> 35:23.587
to make it look
like a suicide.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.556
That's what happened,
isn't it?

35:34.898 --> 35:37.601
He told you so, too.

35:37.634 --> 35:40.571
Didn't he?

35:53.917 --> 35:56.887
The only reason Scott Wallace
was ever arrested

35:56.920 --> 35:59.756
was that perceived admission.

35:59.790 --> 36:01.892
The DNA evidence,
the head fracture--

36:01.925 --> 36:05.395
all that came from
him trying to save her.

36:05.428 --> 36:07.564
The prosecution's entire case

36:07.598 --> 36:11.635
is his reaction to being
accused of the murder.

36:11.668 --> 36:14.370
It wasn't a normal reaction,
they say.

36:14.404 --> 36:17.908
That's not how people
normally respond.

36:17.941 --> 36:20.744
Have you ever been
in this situation?

36:20.777 --> 36:22.913
Your wife die recently?

36:22.946 --> 36:24.681
Your husband?

36:24.715 --> 36:28.384
Any of you accused
of murdering a spouse

36:28.418 --> 36:31.788
in the immediate wake
of discovering the death?

36:31.822 --> 36:35.659
We're really going to sit here
and discuss normal reactions?

36:35.692 --> 36:37.493
Seems to me

36:37.527 --> 36:40.430
a mental breakdown of some sort
is the most normal.

36:40.463 --> 36:42.933
That's what Dr. Murphy told you
Scott was experiencing.

36:42.966 --> 36:44.601
Scott himself told you that.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.703
He was feeling nauseous
in that interrogation,

36:46.737 --> 36:48.338
about to black out.

36:48.371 --> 36:49.706
As Dr. Murphy said,

36:49.740 --> 36:53.276
he was suffering from
twin positional traumas.

36:53.309 --> 36:56.412
How dare they charge him
with murder

36:56.446 --> 36:58.949
because they didn't like
the way he responded

36:58.982 --> 37:01.051
to being accused?

37:01.084 --> 37:04.555
They better have more than that,
and they don't.

37:04.588 --> 37:06.690
And now--

37:06.723 --> 37:08.692
now the D. A. wants you
to find guilt

37:08.725 --> 37:11.695
because Scott Wallace
got angry in the witness chair.

37:11.728 --> 37:15.298
You saw his rage, didn't you?
Let's convict on that.

37:15.331 --> 37:18.434
First, they arrest him
because he didn't get angry,

37:18.468 --> 37:21.872
and now they want you to convict
because he did.

37:26.342 --> 37:28.712
You know, people ask me

37:28.745 --> 37:33.717
how I can spend my days
being a criminal defense lawyer,

37:33.750 --> 37:35.451
defending guilty people.

37:35.485 --> 37:38.855
Well, I am in this

37:38.889 --> 37:42.325
to defend
the innocent ones,

37:42.358 --> 37:46.529
and there is an innocent one
sitting right over there.

37:47.898 --> 37:50.400
For six months now,

37:50.433 --> 37:53.469
they've kept him locked up.

37:53.503 --> 37:56.006
He couldn't even go
to her funeral.

37:56.039 --> 37:59.342
He's never been to her grave.

37:59.375 --> 38:04.480
They've taken away his life.

38:04.514 --> 38:07.618
Karen Wallace took her own.

38:07.651 --> 38:11.588
The police have taken his.

38:11.622 --> 38:15.058
Enough is enough.

38:17.060 --> 38:22.899
Give freedom back...

38:22.933 --> 38:27.638
to an innocent man.

38:36.547 --> 38:39.983
Nutshell--

38:40.016 --> 38:43.053
borderline psychotic man
in financial trouble

38:44.182 --> 38:49.291
renews insurance policy on wife
a month before her death.

38:49.693 --> 38:51.662
She threatens to leave him.

38:51.695 --> 38:54.397
He's heard screaming at her.

38:54.430 --> 38:59.035
She's found dead
with a fractured skull.

38:59.069 --> 39:01.404
When accused of the crime,

39:01.437 --> 39:05.108
he doesn't even deny it.

39:13.817 --> 39:17.754
REPORTER: You like
Bobby Donnell, personally?

39:17.788 --> 39:19.890
He's a pretty good guy.

39:19.923 --> 39:21.892
It's one thing
for two men

39:21.925 --> 39:23.894
looking
at the same evidence

39:23.927 --> 39:25.629
to have
different opinions,

39:25.662 --> 39:28.031
but you two seem
so convinced

39:28.064 --> 39:30.934
in opposite directions.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.170
D.A.s come to prosecute

39:34.204 --> 39:37.173
those they believe
to be guilty.

39:37.207 --> 39:39.509
Defense attorneys
come to believe

39:39.543 --> 39:41.912
those they choose
to defend.

39:41.945 --> 39:45.816
That certainly makes
the D. A. s sound more noble.

39:47.217 --> 39:48.451
We are.

39:51.154 --> 39:53.123
REPORTER:
Does he usually hibernate

39:53.156 --> 39:55.125
when he waits
for a verdict?

39:55.158 --> 39:57.694
Yeah. Waiting--
it can be a killer.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.664
A lot of lawyers just
go about other business.

40:00.697 --> 40:02.198
Bobby-- he can't.

40:02.232 --> 40:03.800
Aren't there other clients?

40:03.834 --> 40:06.670
Plenty, and he could be
out right now

40:06.703 --> 40:08.204
bringing in new ones.

40:08.238 --> 40:09.806
Bobby Donnell--

40:09.840 --> 40:12.208
if you're looking
to build a law practice,

40:12.242 --> 40:14.210
he's not the guy to hire.

40:14.244 --> 40:16.813
But if you ever
get charged with murder...

40:16.847 --> 40:17.814
(telephone rings)

40:17.848 --> 40:21.217
LUCY: Hotline. Hello?

40:21.251 --> 40:23.687
Okay, thank you.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.722
Jury's back.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.159
Mr. Wallace,
would you please rise?

41:09.099 --> 41:10.967
The jury has reached
its verdict?

41:11.001 --> 41:12.002
We have, your honor.

41:12.035 --> 41:13.704
What say you?

41:15.672 --> 41:18.742
Commonwealth
vs. Scott Wallace,

41:18.775 --> 41:21.111
on count one--
murder in the first degree,

41:21.144 --> 41:24.280
we find the defendant
Scott Wallace

41:24.314 --> 41:25.649
not guilty.

41:25.682 --> 41:28.852
(gallery murmuring)

41:28.885 --> 41:32.923
Count two--
murder in the second degree,

41:32.956 --> 41:35.125
we find the defendant
Scott Wallace

41:35.158 --> 41:36.660
not guilty.

41:36.693 --> 41:38.929
(gallery reacting loudly)

41:38.962 --> 41:40.931
JUDGE HILLER:
Members of the jury,

41:40.964 --> 41:42.332
this concludes your service.

41:42.365 --> 41:44.935
On behalf of the commonwealth,
I thank you.

41:44.968 --> 41:47.738
Mr. Wallace,
you are free to go.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.673
We are adjourned.

41:49.706 --> 41:51.174
(gavel pounds)

41:54.978 --> 41:57.548
SCOTT: Thank you, buddy.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.271
REPORTER: It wasn't
as ugly as you predicted.

42:21.304 --> 42:23.874
No. I thought they all
behaved very well.

42:23.907 --> 42:26.743
It was nice to see
for a change.

42:26.777 --> 42:29.746
Do you think
it was the right result?

42:29.780 --> 42:31.281
Probably.

42:31.314 --> 42:33.884
I suppose there was
reasonable doubt.

42:33.917 --> 42:37.320
But do you think
it was the right result?

42:39.189 --> 42:42.826
I haven't
the slightest idea.

42:50.767 --> 42:53.770
â™ª (theme)

43:16.392 --> 43:18.094
You stinker!
