09:04.099 --> 09:07.341
I tho... I thought it
was gonna be much worse.

09:07.343 --> 09:11.345
It already has 72 comments and 423 likes.

09:11.347 --> 09:13.467
It's pinging around all the tours.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.148
Okay, that's worse.

09:15.150 --> 09:17.791
Plus, we are down another nanny.

09:17.793 --> 09:20.474
Oh, should I ask Kelly Ann if
she'll stay on one more night?

09:20.476 --> 09:22.196
Yes, yes.

09:22.198 --> 09:23.597
Kelly Ann worships you.

09:23.599 --> 09:25.118
She started saying "ha" because you say it.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.400
Ha!

09:26.402 --> 09:27.481
Is that why you don't like her,

09:27.483 --> 09:28.802
because she idolizes me?

09:28.804 --> 09:30.324
Oh, that is so good to know.

09:30.326 --> 09:31.965
Okay, hold on. I don't not like her.

09:31.967 --> 09:34.127
I mean, she knew she
was going to film school

09:34.129 --> 09:35.729
at the beginning of the
tour, but she gave me

09:35.731 --> 09:37.411
two weeks' notice.

09:37.413 --> 09:39.253
Plus, she eats off other people's plates.

09:39.255 --> 09:41.375
Look, I-I know you dread
talking to management.

09:41.377 --> 09:43.417
Would you like me to call Preston for you?

09:43.419 --> 09:44.858
Okay, got it. Thank you.

09:44.860 --> 09:48.262
I love you.

09:48.264 --> 09:51.064
Are you... was that to me or to him?

09:51.066 --> 09:52.346
Uh, I know. Talk tonight.

09:52.348 --> 09:53.146
Because if it was to me, I'm yours.

09:53.148 --> 09:54.268
Yeah, no.

09:54.270 --> 09:56.430
No, that is just Bill being Bill.

09:56.432 --> 09:57.831
This is great.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.393
All right. Bye, sweetie.

09:59.395 --> 10:00.954
Love you too. Talk tonight.

10:13.289 --> 10:15.729
Let me know if you want me to
call management back for you.

10:15.731 --> 10:16.890
No, no, no, you deal with the locals.

10:16.892 --> 10:18.252
I'll call.

10:18.254 --> 10:19.813
Thanks to you, Ron Bank is already

10:19.815 --> 10:23.337
making today awesomely hard.

10:23.339 --> 10:25.060
- [laughs]
- Awesomely!

10:27.663 --> 10:28.862
[Bill] This is Puna.

10:28.864 --> 10:30.424
He's band security.

10:30.426 --> 10:33.106
If he comes to you with
an issue, you listen.

10:33.108 --> 10:35.349
He's actually clairvoyant about problems.

10:35.351 --> 10:37.391
He'll spot them before they happen.

10:53.969 --> 10:55.609
I'm just gonna say, starting that night,

10:55.611 --> 10:58.532
I spent nine days in jail, which
was a very dark time for me.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.733
I-I was told you'd laugh.

10:59.735 --> 11:01.295

there's one thing my lead singer
cannot deal with in any form.

- We do not tolerate...
- Bill.

11:08.143 --> 11:09.503
...under any circumstances...

11:09.505 --> 11:10.864
- Hi, guys.
- Just one second.

11:10.866 --> 11:12.306
I just... no, I just talked to management.

11:12.308 --> 11:13.307
You're gonna want to hear this.

11:13.309 --> 11:14.508

- Yeah.

11:14.510 --> 11:15.869
Okay. You guys hang tight.

11:15.871 --> 11:17.991
You're doing a great job. Thanks.

11:17.993 --> 11:19.353
[Bill] What did Preston say?

11:19.355 --> 11:20.514
[Shelli] He said he'd come himself,

11:20.516 --> 11:21.475
but he can't travel.

11:21.477 --> 11:23.156
His kid has an arm injury.

11:23.158 --> 11:24.558
- Shit.
- Mm-hmm.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.400
He always cancels the
trip at the last minute

11:26.402 --> 11:28.402
if there's a confrontation to avoid.

11:28.404 --> 11:32.085
Preston not coming means bloodshed.

11:32.087 --> 11:33.407
I know. He's always blaming the kid.

11:33.409 --> 11:35.489
So now he's sending someone?

11:35.491 --> 11:37.170
Here, today.

11:37.172 --> 11:39.535
A new "financial advisor."

11:41.457 --> 11:42.536
What?

11:42.538 --> 11:44.418
Why are your ears turning red?

11:44.420 --> 11:45.419
They're not.

11:45.421 --> 11:47.661
- What more do you know?
- What?

11:47.663 --> 11:49.983
It's me.

11:49.985 --> 11:51.385
I'm getting fired, aren't I?

11:51.387 --> 11:52.546
It's not you.

11:52.548 --> 11:55.789
Then what are you not telling me?

11:55.791 --> 11:58.672
You know who's gonna be really pissed?

11:58.674 --> 12:00.434
- Right?
- Phil.

12:00.436 --> 12:03.156
You know Phil carries a loaded firearm?

12:03.158 --> 12:04.198

12:04.200 --> 12:05.199
- Harvey?
- I'ma dip out.

12:05.201 --> 12:06.280
Check on my storage units.

12:06.282 --> 12:07.761
Sure, go ahead.

12:07.763 --> 12:10.003
And did we find a
replacement for Kelly Ann yet?

12:10.005 --> 12:11.685
[together] Not yet.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.568
You two are in denial.

12:14.570 --> 12:16.570
About a lot of things.

12:16.572 --> 12:19.012
[chuckles]

12:19.014 --> 12:23.056
And that one thing that we cannot tolerate

12:23.058 --> 12:26.019
is firecrackers.

12:26.021 --> 12:27.140
You got it?

12:27.142 --> 12:29.423
If you see it, seize it.

12:29.425 --> 12:31.064
Why firecrackers?

12:31.066 --> 12:33.587

firecrackers, Des Moines,

12:35.191 --> 12:36.470
or you can just trust me, boys.

12:36.472 --> 12:38.232
I've seen a lot of meltdowns.

12:38.234 --> 12:39.873
Hey, Phil. Can I call you that?

12:39.875 --> 12:42.596
That's my name. It ain't
just letters on a hat.

12:42.598 --> 12:44.398
You worked with my
favorite band of all time,

12:44.400 --> 12:46.602
the original Lynyrd Skynyrd.

12:50.446 --> 12:53.527
This was given to me in 197...

12:53.529 --> 12:58.532
in 1976 by Ronnie Van Zant.

12:58.534 --> 13:00.294
And I have not taken it off since.

13:00.296 --> 13:01.615
Who's Robbie Van Zant?

13:01.617 --> 13:04.218
Ooh!

13:04.220 --> 13:05.859
Who is Ronnie Van Zant?

13:05.861 --> 13:07.541
Do your homework, son.

13:07.543 --> 13:09.543
This is a privilege, not a vacation.

13:09.545 --> 13:11.545
There's a tradition on this adventure,

13:11.547 --> 13:13.066
and you need to bone up on whose shoulders

13:13.068 --> 13:14.228
you're standing on.

13:14.230 --> 13:16.069
All right. Let's recap.

13:16.071 --> 13:18.352
What've we learned to
pay special attention to?

13:18.354 --> 13:19.593
[together] Firecrackers!

13:19.595 --> 13:22.636
Do not put your cups or fingerprints

13:22.638 --> 13:24.478
on the piano, okay?

13:24.480 --> 13:28.121
See, I got a keyboard player.

13:28.123 --> 13:30.684
He can't play if it's not shiny.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.207
He can feel a smudge.

13:33.209 --> 13:34.648
And if that happens...

13:34.650 --> 13:36.532
It's as bad as firecrackers.

13:39.655 --> 13:41.697
Nothing's as bad as firecrackers.

16:31.146 --> 16:32.666
Oh, yeah, film school.

16:32.668 --> 16:34.788
Maybe...

16:34.790 --> 16:37.551
I have to find my own voice.

16:37.553 --> 16:40.073
Maybe I can change the world. Ha.

16:40.075 --> 16:42.035
Guess what, I've been this close to people

16:42.037 --> 16:43.917
who actually did change the world,

16:43.919 --> 16:46.039
and it turns out I like being an Indian

16:46.041 --> 16:47.841
better than I like trying to be a chief.

16:47.843 --> 16:49.643
You know what I mean.

16:49.645 --> 16:52.526
The truth?

16:52.528 --> 16:56.089
I don't hear the music the same way.

16:56.091 --> 16:59.493
I don't feel like it's mine anymore.

16:59.495 --> 17:00.934
Sit down, honey.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.377
Sit down.

17:03.379 --> 17:05.219
I feel the same way about my dog,

17:05.221 --> 17:07.781
but I'm not giving her away.

17:07.782 --> 17:10.664
"Get messy, get real,

17:10.665 --> 17:11.944
that's the whole deal."

17:11.946 --> 17:13.467
Didn't you tell me that once?

17:13.469 --> 17:14.828
I say that to everybody.

17:14.829 --> 17:15.789
Well, I listened.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.511
It comes and goes, sweetheart.

17:17.512 --> 17:21.435
But if you love the
music, and I know you do,

17:21.436 --> 17:23.877
you might want to give
it all another chance.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.039
I don't even know if the
band are feeling it either.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.722
They haven't changed their
set since the last tour.

17:28.724 --> 17:32.045
I have to be a fan of
something or I'm useless.

17:32.047 --> 17:33.447
I'm nothing.

17:33.449 --> 17:35.008
I'm worker bee on bus number one.

17:35.010 --> 17:39.293
And I'd stay an Indian
forever if I still...

17:39.295 --> 17:43.457
But my whole belief thing is...

17:43.459 --> 17:46.700
it's just starting to crack.

17:46.702 --> 17:49.303
Tell 'em. It's a family.

17:49.305 --> 17:51.185
Walk up to Tom or Christopher tonight.

17:51.187 --> 17:52.386
Tell 'em why you're leaving.

17:52.388 --> 17:54.188
No, but I don't talk to the band.

17:54.190 --> 17:56.710
Look... [sighs]

17:56.712 --> 17:58.392
I'll die with this band.

17:58.394 --> 18:00.754
But honestly, I can see right now,

18:00.756 --> 18:02.796
because I know people,

18:02.798 --> 18:05.879
I know it's time for
you to move on, Julianne.

18:05.881 --> 18:08.041
It's Kelly Ann.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.883

18:09.885 --> 18:12.886
I might get your name wrong,
but I know exactly who you are.

18:14.850 --> 18:15.889

18:15.891 --> 18:18.011
Not everybody's got a vibe.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.777
But don't ever think that
you can't come back here

18:23.779 --> 18:25.459
and be a legend.

18:25.461 --> 18:27.661
And I say that as a legend myself.

This has nothing to do
with your tour manager

19:03.859 --> 19:05.939
corrupting my daughter.

Ron, I know about the
special rug you put down

19:15.871 --> 19:17.591
over the pelican for Taylor Swift.

19:17.593 --> 19:19.873
But I'm going to post a picture on Facebook

19:19.875 --> 19:23.317
of Tom Staton's wardrobe
case in a broom closet.

19:23.319 --> 19:24.958

You need this show to happen
tonight as much as we do.

19:35.811 --> 19:36.970
I know.

19:36.972 --> 19:38.572
And I am sorry about your daughter.

19:38.574 --> 19:41.175
She is truly lovely. I saw her naked.

19:46.582 --> 19:48.262
and I am not a hugger, but haul it in.

19:48.264 --> 19:49.663

Hi, mate.

21:11.547 --> 21:12.946
Wes, we met at the Bridge School show.

21:12.948 --> 21:13.787
You were doing Elvis.

21:13.789 --> 21:16.670
We talked about Dylan.

21:16.672 --> 21:18.592
PJ was amazing that night.

21:18.594 --> 21:19.873
Fuckers.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.475
I got "Blonde on Blonde" outtakes.

21:21.477 --> 21:22.476

21:22.478 --> 21:23.917
But these are insane quality

- Yeah.

21:27.403 --> 21:29.763

21:29.765 --> 21:32.966
So you're asking about Kelly Ann?

21:32.968 --> 21:35.489
Uh, yeah, she hates me for coming here.

21:35.491 --> 21:37.130
Hey, do you want me to
make you an espresso?

21:37.132 --> 21:38.171
No, thanks.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.132
Dude, I'm famous for my espressos.

21:39.134 --> 21:40.694
You shouldn't say no.

21:40.696 --> 21:42.696
She hates me more, mate. Trust me.

21:42.698 --> 21:44.938
I just found out she's leaving this tour

21:44.940 --> 21:47.181
to get away from our
love-hate relationship.

21:47.183 --> 21:49.743
Look, Kelly Ann is an
escape artist, all right?

21:49.745 --> 21:52.025
She has emotions, just not like

21:52.027 --> 21:53.347
you and I understand them.

21:53.349 --> 21:55.749
If she could just smile.

21:55.751 --> 21:58.832
But not just near me, like, at me.

21:58.834 --> 22:01.235
Dude, she fears a good time.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.597
Is that something you
really want in a girlfriend?

22:03.599 --> 22:05.158
Yes.

How do you know her so well?

22:06.762 --> 22:08.121
Who are you?

22:08.123 --> 22:09.523
I shouldn't be talking to you.

22:09.525 --> 22:10.804
I shouldn't be talking to anyone.

22:10.806 --> 22:12.206
I already know too much.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.568
Something really bad is about to happen.

22:14.570 --> 22:16.570

like someone's getting fired?

22:17.973 --> 22:18.972
What have you heard?

22:18.974 --> 22:20.934
What you just told me.

22:20.936 --> 22:22.336
Is that an espresso? Where'd you get that?

22:22.338 --> 22:23.857

what happened with PJ.

22:35.070 --> 22:36.350
That's too bad.

22:36.352 --> 22:37.631
It's tough.

22:37.633 --> 22:38.832
They were my band.

22:38.834 --> 22:39.753

22:39.755 --> 22:40.874

22:40.876 --> 22:42.476

22:42.478 --> 22:44.398

22:44.400 --> 22:46.800
Someone is going down.

22:46.802 --> 22:51.325
And I think it's me, Wes.

22:51.327 --> 22:52.206
Shit.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.208
I just said too much.

22:54.210 --> 22:56.210
I never do that.

22:56.212 --> 22:59.813
Wes, I just fucked up, okay?

22:59.815 --> 23:01.815
God damn it, I said too much.

23:01.817 --> 23:03.016
Don't tell anybody.

23:03.018 --> 23:05.939
Really, Wes, nobody, okay?

23:05.941 --> 23:10.063

23:11.547 --> 23:12.546

23:12.548 --> 23:14.788

23:14.790 --> 23:16.870

- Uh, no, no.
- What?

26:19.215 --> 26:20.454
I can't. I got this ticket.

26:20.456 --> 26:23.217
And I got to be on a red-eye at 11:00.

I didn't get it exactly.

these climactic moments

26:36.392 --> 26:38.151
of people running from all these movies.

26:38.153 --> 26:39.753
- People running.
- Yeah.

26:39.755 --> 26:42.155
You know how in movies when
people realize something,

26:42.157 --> 26:43.317
right, like they were wrong...

26:43.319 --> 26:44.438
- Right.
- ...or they were in love,

26:44.440 --> 26:45.679
and they just start running...

26:45.681 --> 26:47.321
The point I was actually trying to make

26:47.323 --> 26:48.802
is when you see everybody running on, like,

26:48.804 --> 26:50.804
a long tracking shot, that
is completely manipulative.

26:50.806 --> 26:52.406
I was actually trying to make a statement

26:52.408 --> 26:54.408
about how fake those moments are,

26:54.410 --> 26:56.250
identity versus reality, and how life just

26:56.252 --> 26:58.812
cheats you out of your

27:03.419 --> 27:06.460

27:11.827 --> 27:13.187
