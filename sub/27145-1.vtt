Lotte entertainment presents

00:48.340 --> 00:53.130
between heaven and earth
is a place called cloudland.

00:56.223 --> 01:04.187
People stay until they're forgotten
before going up to heaven.

01:08.318 --> 01:16.318
Mommy penguin peeped down on earth
through a hole and cried everyday.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.542
When the rainy season
started 1 year later,

01:28.046 --> 01:32.335
she secretly hopped on
the raindrop train.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.842
The train stopped
at a small station.

01:43.979 --> 01:48.564
Suddenly, she heard a baby’s cry.

01:50.068 --> 01:55.984
She ran over to find her baby penguin
in a yellow raincoat crying.

02:06.251 --> 02:10.995
She held her baby penguin tight.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.883
Suddenly, a miracle happened!

02:21.725 --> 02:27.470
Mommy and baby
always stayed together.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.101
They played games.

02:31.234 --> 02:36.820
Mommy taught her baby
how to fish, and had fun together.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.066
Soon, the rainy season
was almost over.

02:42.537 --> 02:48.077
Raindrop fairy from cloudland
came and whispered to mommy penguin.

02:49.586 --> 02:55.047
"You must return
before the clouds roll away."

02:56.051 --> 03:00.385
"If you miss the last raindrop train,
you can’t go back to cloudland.”

03:01.890 --> 03:05.883
"then you won't be able to watch
your baby through the clouds.”

03:08.563 --> 03:13.227
mommy was sad, but she didn’t cry.

03:14.236 --> 03:18.400
Her baby smiled back at her too.

03:20.492 --> 03:27.864
They hugged each other
and said goodbye with a smile.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.534
Mommy penguin returned to cloudland

03:31.586 --> 03:38.128
and watched her baby everyday,
but didn’t cry anymore.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.681
70 j-ho from mom

03:47.018 --> 03:48.724
she died way too young.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.557
Can the boy's father
take care of him?

03:54.943 --> 03:59.232
We warned it'd be dangerous
to have a baby.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.190
She was fine
before giving birth.

04:03.452 --> 04:04.908
That's right!

04:09.332 --> 04:11.038
See you again, mom.

04:19.843 --> 04:26.180
Be with you

04:28.393 --> 04:31.556
1 year later
summer, 2006

07:01.379 --> 07:03.870
ji-ho! Wake up!

07:05.133 --> 07:06.543
It’s time for school!

07:09.554 --> 07:10.554
Son!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.600
Slept in her wardrobe again?

07:26.404 --> 07:28.770
Let's have breakfast.
Wake up!

07:36.247 --> 07:38.738
It’s sunny throughout
the country today.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.037
It'll be a high of 29 °c in Seoul.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.751
Daegu will go up to a high of 30 °c.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.459
It'll be 2~3 degrees hotter
than yesterday.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.957
The rainy season will begin
this weekend.

07:49.260 --> 07:54.550
Jeju island
will get heavy downfalls.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.181
The seasonal rain front
isn’t moving northward...

07:59.229 --> 08:01.311
Does rainy season
start with rain?

08:01.606 --> 08:02.391
Probably.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.771
Does it always rain?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.980
It usually comes and goes.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.854
You said it has to rain.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.406
When rainy season starts,

08:14.202 --> 08:17.444
sometimes it rains
and sometimes it doesn’t.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.284
What if it rains in jeju island?

08:24.462 --> 08:28.455
Then rainy season starts?
It’s part of our country too.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.168
Yes. Don’t worry.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.720
Rainy season will come.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.054
Hurry up and eat.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.597
- Are you excited too?
- About what?

08:42.272 --> 08:44.354
Mom will come
when the rainy season starts.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.154
Ji-ho...

08:53.408 --> 08:54.408
Yes?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.202
Let’s wait and see.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.158
Eat up. You'll be late.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.036
Don’t worry.
Mom will keep her promise.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.826
It’s in the book too!

09:33.364 --> 09:34.319
Your medicine!

09:34.365 --> 09:35.365
Right!

09:40.663 --> 09:41.869
See you later!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.037
Aren’t you hot?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.165
- It might rain
- see you later.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.523
After school...

10:10.527 --> 10:12.392
I'll go to uncle hong—gu.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.021
- Pay attention in class.
- I will.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.737
Go, dad! You're late!

10:30.755 --> 10:31.961
Here you are.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.796
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.255
- Please come often.
- I will.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.637
How about number 110?

10:41.891 --> 10:42.891
Here you go.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.062
Thanks for the coffee.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.108
Sure.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.283
Wait...

11:01.661 --> 11:02.661
Here.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.164
Pardon?

11:05.957 --> 11:07.663
Your buttons...

11:16.759 --> 11:18.590
Hyun-jung? Coffee.

11:19.721 --> 11:20.927
I had some already.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.514
Did you clean in the morning?

11:26.144 --> 11:27.930
Yes, I cleaned everything.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.479
Good job!

11:36.321 --> 11:39.905
One, two, three, four!

11:39.908 --> 11:43.116
One, two, three, four!

11:43.161 --> 11:44.992
- Look at him!
- He’s handsome!

11:48.833 --> 11:50.323
What are you doing?

11:50.668 --> 11:51.668
Hurry up!

11:51.836 --> 11:55.249
Why are you afraid of
getting in the water?

11:55.506 --> 11:59.624
Why work here
if you're so scared of water?

12:03.348 --> 12:05.179
Hong-gu bakery

12:35.797 --> 12:36.797
not again.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.130
Why the long face?

12:42.720 --> 12:43.835
What happened at school?

12:46.349 --> 12:47.349
Nothing.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.436
Tell me what's wrong.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.189
Dad can’t run, can he?

12:58.152 --> 13:00.518
Why can’t he do so many things?

13:01.239 --> 13:02.239
Going through puberty?

13:02.323 --> 13:03.403
What's that?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.616
Forget it.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.901
Well, your dad is...

13:08.454 --> 13:11.696
You know the lights that turn on
automatically when you pass by?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.077
There's one at our front door.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.332
How does it turn on?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.744
If I move under it.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.797
Right.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.922
Does it turn on
if people don’t pass by it?

13:22.093 --> 13:23.093
It does.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.005
- It does?
- Yup.

13:25.179 --> 13:28.546
It turns on if a fly or the wind
passes under it.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.966
Why's the light like its owner?

13:31.644 --> 13:32.644
Anyway,

13:33.146 --> 13:36.730
if it goes on and off all the time,
what will happen?

13:37.066 --> 13:38.066
It’s broken.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.648
It’s broken already?

13:39.902 --> 13:40.231
Yup.

13:40.570 --> 13:45.360
If you're dad works hard
all the time, he’ll break down too.

13:45.491 --> 13:45.980
I guess.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.781
So, he can’t do everything.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.693
That's why he can’t run?

13:51.539 --> 13:52.539
It’s too hard.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.823
What about driving?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.033
What if he gets in an accident?

13:57.670 --> 13:58.750
And movie theaters?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.045
There’s lots to watch on TV.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.005
But why ask about running?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.338
I'm the class rep
for the relay race.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.094
Way to go, kid!

14:12.143 --> 14:13.929
We have to run with our dads.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.309
You've got me! Don’t worry!

14:18.358 --> 14:21.850
But your legs are short.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.028
Ji—ho!

14:24.405 --> 14:25.815
You got my legs all wrong!

14:26.074 --> 14:27.074
Come here.

14:30.328 --> 14:30.783
Here.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.409
Touch right there.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.746
- Feel that bone?
- Yes!

14:36.250 --> 14:38.241
Most people’s legs stop there.

14:40.755 --> 14:41.835
Now, touch mine.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.085
I can’t feel it!

14:45.176 --> 14:47.337
Know why you can’t feel
my leg bones?

14:47.804 --> 14:48.418
No.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.299
My legs don’t stop there!

14:50.640 --> 14:52.130
My legs go up to here!

14:52.308 --> 14:52.842
Like what?

14:52.975 --> 14:53.760
Penguins!

14:53.935 --> 14:56.347
Then think I'll be fast or not
with these long legs?

14:56.354 --> 14:58.936
- Totally fast!
- You got it!

14:58.981 --> 14:59.981
Let’s win!

15:02.151 --> 15:03.151
Dad!

15:06.322 --> 15:07.732
Why do you look so happy?

15:07.740 --> 15:11.073
Uncle hong—-gu will run
in the relay race with me.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.484
- Relay race?
- Yes!

15:12.662 --> 15:14.823
We're supposed to run
with our dads,

15:14.831 --> 15:18.164
but uncle Hong-gu says he’s fast
because of his super long legs.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.378
Really? That's great.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.757
Bye uncle Hong-gu!
Go penguin!

15:28.803 --> 15:29.803
Go!

15:33.266 --> 15:34.266
Thanks, pal.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.350
No problem.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.135
One of my customers
is a really classy lady.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.188
See ya.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.559
Don’t be shy, pall

15:53.077 --> 15:55.068
blue team wins/

15:57.206 --> 15:58.491
thanks for your help.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.165
Don’t worry. Have fun.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.377
Thank you.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.130
Hey, jeong!

16:08.301 --> 16:08.881
Come here.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.384
We got many complaints.

16:11.429 --> 16:15.263
Members say it's dark
and the light is flashing.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.641
I'd change it,
but I'm afraid of heights.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.930
I can’t even change my light bulbs.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.520
Could you hurry it up?

16:23.566 --> 16:24.566
Your son must be waiting.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.483
Isn't there a race every year?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.568
You can go next year, right?

16:29.739 --> 16:30.899
Listen up.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.113
When I get the Baton
and start running,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.525
it takes me about 3 seconds
to reach full speed.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.111
Get it? You hear me?

16:38.122 --> 16:38.907
So I'll...

16:38.915 --> 16:39.915
Jeong ji-ho!

16:47.924 --> 16:50.506
Wow! His legs are really long!

16:51.093 --> 16:52.378
See? I told you!

16:54.555 --> 16:55.555
Still, he can't.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.682
Why's it so small?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.392
Give me the shirt.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.112
Why?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.520
Hurry up.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.358
What's with you?

17:14.617 --> 17:16.858
You're not my dad.

17:16.911 --> 17:24.534
Next up is the family relay run.
Participants, take your positions.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.867
Your attention, please.

17:27.296 --> 17:35.214
Next up is the family relay run.
Participants, take your positions.

17:40.059 --> 17:40.718
Daddy!

17:40.851 --> 17:43.718
Son? I can just jog, right?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.727
Sure! I'll run fast!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.432
Let’s go white team!

17:49.485 --> 17:51.350
Let’s go blue team!

18:03.457 --> 18:05.072

That's it! Go ji-ho!

18:36.574 --> 18:37.574
Go! Go! Go!

18:45.583 --> 18:49.917
Go blue team!

19:40.221 --> 19:42.007
Get up, mister!

19:42.807 --> 19:43.807
Dad!

20:02.993 --> 20:05.359
- I must've embarrassed you.
- No way!

20:09.792 --> 20:10.792
Dad?

20:14.922 --> 20:18.164
You'll never leave me, will you?

20:24.306 --> 20:28.640
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.893
- Promise?
- Of course!

20:34.525 --> 20:36.186
I swear on cloudland.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.235
Okay!

20:43.117 --> 20:44.117
I'll carry you.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.116
But you must be tired.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.571
I want to carry my son.
Get on.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.825
Let's gol!

20:56.380 --> 20:57.540
Dad?

20:57.840 --> 20:58.840
What?

20:59.091 --> 21:02.675
Let's wash our blankets
when we go home.

21:03.929 --> 21:04.929
Why?

21:05.222 --> 21:07.588
Uncle Hong-gu said
then it'll rain.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.049
- Really?
- Yup!

21:10.728 --> 21:13.219
- Then let's go home faster.
- Okay!

21:13.731 --> 21:15.187
- Hold tight!
- Okay.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.482
Let's fly!

21:22.740 --> 21:24.105
What are you looking for?

21:24.700 --> 21:25.780
A four-lear clover.

21:25.868 --> 21:31.238
You said if we find 10 of them,
a wish will come true.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.784
What’s your wish ji-ho?

21:34.084 --> 21:35.164
For you to be healthy.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.872
Thanks honey.
Mommy will be healthy.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.962
- Promise?
- Promise!

22:18.629 --> 22:19.629
Dad!

22:22.883 --> 22:24.419
Dad! It's raining!

22:24.510 --> 22:25.545
What?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.384
Let's go see mom!

22:28.389 --> 22:29.389
Ji—ho!

22:29.932 --> 22:30.932
Ji—ho!

22:31.016 --> 22:32.756
You'll catch a cold! Wait!

22:34.562 --> 22:35.562
Ji—ho!

22:57.001 --> 22:58.001
Mom!

23:00.504 --> 23:01.504
Mommy!

23:03.090 --> 23:04.705
Mom! Where are you?

23:09.972 --> 23:13.055
That's weird. Where's mom?

23:13.851 --> 23:16.217
She’s not here yet?

23:28.782 --> 23:29.782
Wanna go now?

23:30.284 --> 23:31.774
No! I'm not leaving.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.619
You'll catch a cold.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.200
I'm not going!

23:41.837 --> 23:44.920
Something must've kept her
from coming today.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.834
Let's come next time.

23:48.135 --> 23:52.003
No! Mom said she'll come
with the rain!

23:54.266 --> 23:55.631
Let's go home.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.934
No! She said she’ll come today!

23:59.229 --> 24:05.225
Put me down! Stop it!

24:25.422 --> 24:26.422
What's that?

24:31.178 --> 24:32.178
It’s mom!

24:36.016 --> 24:38.428
Why? I want to go to mom!

24:38.811 --> 24:41.644
You wait right here.
I'll go check first.

24:41.897 --> 24:42.897
No!

24:43.190 --> 24:44.190
Jeong ji-ho!

24:53.409 --> 24:55.365
Stay back!

25:03.335 --> 25:05.326
It’s mom, right?

25:05.921 --> 25:06.921
Wait.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.414
Calm down. Relax

25:11.301 --> 25:12.507
she could be a ghost.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.426
Who cares? She’s mom.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.588
Right.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.017
Mom!

25:19.601 --> 25:20.601
Ji—ho!

25:21.395 --> 25:22.395
Mommy!

25:22.521 --> 25:23.727
No! Don’t touch her!

25:23.731 --> 25:25.096
- Mom!
- No!

25:25.482 --> 25:26.767
- Mom!
- Watch out! Stop!

25:27.443 --> 25:29.604
- Ji-ho!
- Mom! Wake up!

25:41.665 --> 25:43.371
See? It’s mom!

25:45.961 --> 25:46.961
Who are you?

25:47.921 --> 25:51.834
Mom? Don’t you remember?
It's me, ji-ho.

25:52.926 --> 25:53.926
Mom?

25:54.178 --> 25:55.178
I'm your mom?

25:55.637 --> 25:57.673
Why don’t you know me?

25:57.723 --> 26:01.466
You said you'll come back
from cloudland when it rains.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.509
What does that mean?

26:04.438 --> 26:07.726
Dad! Explain it to her! Come on!

26:10.861 --> 26:11.941
It hurts.

26:12.488 --> 26:17.528
Get up!
I'll show you at home. Come on!

26:17.618 --> 26:18.618
Wait.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.484
- Hurry!
- Let's go home.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.586
This is you, mom.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.210
You and me. See?

26:43.519 --> 26:44.519
There’s more!

26:56.448 --> 26:57.233
Tadal

26:57.282 --> 26:58.146
welcome back mom!

26:58.200 --> 27:00.486
I made this for your return.

27:01.787 --> 27:02.787
Ji—ho!

27:04.414 --> 27:07.577
I left your things as they are.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.996
Go change and get comfortable.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.460
- Don’t you need to pee?
- No.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.623
- You should pee. Let's go!
- I don’t have to!

27:19.054 --> 27:22.091
Why doesn’t mom
remember anything?

27:23.517 --> 27:26.509
Maybe she hit her head
on the way from cloudland?

27:27.146 --> 27:29.683
I don’t think
she knows that either.

27:30.190 --> 27:30.645
What?

27:31.108 --> 27:32.108
That she...

27:32.359 --> 27:33.474
Went to cloudland.

27:35.279 --> 27:36.279
Oh really?

27:40.117 --> 27:43.154
Ji-ho? Let’s keep this a secret.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.359
Why?

27:44.663 --> 27:47.700
What if she gets shocked
and leaves?

27:48.083 --> 27:49.914
Don’t ever say
she'll leave again.

27:49.918 --> 27:54.708
Let's pretend
we lived together all along.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.873
And don’t tell anyone else.
Understand?

27:59.887 --> 28:03.800
If we help her,
mom will get her memory back.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.183
Okay?

28:10.272 --> 28:12.604
Doesn't mom look
a lot healthier?

28:12.733 --> 28:13.813
Yes! And prettier!

28:13.859 --> 28:15.520
Mom's always been pretty.

28:16.862 --> 28:17.862
Let's go.

28:18.906 --> 28:19.906
Excuse me?

28:20.616 --> 28:24.700
Did I really live here?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.951
Yes, you lived here.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.704
- Right?
- Right!

28:29.958 --> 28:36.170
But you mentioned cloudland
and looked happy to see me.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.080
You welcomed me.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.753
And you said you left
my things as they are.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.969
I let the house
get messy like this?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.063
Well...

28:54.900 --> 28:56.356
You were... ah...

28:57.110 --> 28:58.110
Sick!

28:59.196 --> 28:59.855
I was?

29:00.072 --> 29:00.686
That's right!

29:00.906 --> 29:03.613
You were sick and stayed
in the hospital.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.659
Cloudland hospital!

29:06.578 --> 29:07.784
Cloudland...

29:09.081 --> 29:11.538
Why was I in the tunnel
and not the hospital?

29:12.668 --> 29:14.158
You got cured yesterday!

29:17.172 --> 29:20.414
Right! You came home yesterday.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.207
We played hide-and-seek!

29:23.387 --> 29:24.502
Hide-and-seek?

29:25.889 --> 29:28.801
You love playing that.
You're really good.

29:28.809 --> 29:29.389
Right ji-ho?

29:29.559 --> 29:31.049
Right! You're the best.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.279
Mom!

29:49.121 --> 29:50.121
Are you okay?

29:50.831 --> 29:51.570
See dad?

29:51.581 --> 29:53.788
Mom hit her head
on the way down!

29:53.834 --> 29:57.747
Right! A rock must've fallen
and hit you on the head.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.960
Right! A rock!

29:59.006 --> 30:00.792
That's why you fainted there.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.799
That's right.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.673
So, you lost your memory.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.459
- Right.
- That must be it.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.676
- Right.
- Right.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.808
- Thank you.
- Don’t mention it.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.665
Kid? Come here.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.974
Like father like son.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.401
Not me.

31:50.659 --> 31:54.151
I made some fried rice for you.
It’s in the fridge.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.783
Stay home and try to get some rest.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.286
- If you overdo yourself...
- It's up to me

32:00.710 --> 32:02.075
whether I work or lurk.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.917
See you later!

32:12.556 --> 32:13.556
See you.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.655
Mom!

33:12.949 --> 33:14.234
I'm home!

33:14.951 --> 33:15.951
So soon?

33:16.036 --> 33:17.901
My teacher was absent today.

33:33.803 --> 33:34.803
I won.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.552
I let you win.

33:50.612 --> 33:54.150
You're good now.
I won't go easy on you.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.282
Okay.

33:56.576 --> 34:00.034
77, 78, 79...

34:03.917 --> 34:04.917
Barley.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.335
Rice!

34:10.840 --> 34:12.330
Rice! Rice! Rice!

34:14.052 --> 34:15.052
I give up!

34:15.971 --> 34:16.971
I give up! Mom!

34:17.138 --> 34:18.138
I give up!

34:20.891 --> 34:23.554
Dad! It's okay!
We're just playing.

34:32.152 --> 34:33.359
Aren’t you eating?

34:34.822 --> 34:37.235
I want mom’s rice cake skewers.

34:37.742 --> 34:41.280
- Mom needs her rest.
—- but she’s really strong now!

35:32.714 --> 35:33.714
Are you okay?

35:38.637 --> 35:39.637
Yes.

36:01.409 --> 36:04.867
Where's the remote?
There it is.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.643
He insisted on sleeping here.

36:30.647 --> 36:33.639
- I'll take him. Ji-ho?
- It's okay.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.856
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

36:39.322 --> 36:43.440
- Sleep well then.
- Wait.

36:43.660 --> 36:44.115
Yes?

36:44.536 --> 36:45.696
Are you going to sleep?

36:46.788 --> 36:49.154
I will in a bit.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.498
Then, get undressed.

36:58.425 --> 36:59.835
That's what you want?

37:00.301 --> 37:01.461
But ji-ho is here.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.385
I'll wait for you outside.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.596
She shouldn't overdo it.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.597
- Good thing ji-ho's asleep.
- What are you doing?

37:12.814 --> 37:13.894
Your legs got burned too?

37:17.277 --> 37:20.769
Oh, you didn’t mean that.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.864
I'll put it on for you.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.795
By the way,

37:38.006 --> 37:39.587
I don’t remember,

37:41.259 --> 37:45.628
but I guess
I'm a mom and a wife...

37:46.264 --> 37:50.724
Don’t worry.
You'll get your memory back soon.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.217
It’s not that.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.847
I married you for love, right?

37:59.569 --> 38:00.569
Hard to believe?

38:01.571 --> 38:02.856
I'm just curious.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.571
Could you tell me about us?

38:13.249 --> 38:17.117
We first met in high school.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.496
We were in the same class
all three years.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.918
You were the top student
in the school.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.386
You had the highest grades
throughout high school.

38:29.724 --> 38:30.724
Was I a loner?

38:31.100 --> 38:32.100
No.

38:32.727 --> 38:36.595
Just someone who is hard
for normal kids to approach.

38:37.148 --> 38:41.312
Since I was a student-swimmer,
/ only studied half-day.

38:41.861 --> 38:46.480
And I slept during class,
so we had no chance to talk.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.439
Then how did we end up together?

39:04.843 --> 39:07.004
- Saw that?
- Yes!

39:07.220 --> 39:08.380
Swim like that.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.922
If you can swim, go here.
If you can’t, go here.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.594
Don’t fool around back there!

39:18.940 --> 39:19.940
Look!

39:22.277 --> 39:23.277
Soo-a!

39:25.321 --> 39:27.357
Oh no! Help her!

39:45.383 --> 39:46.589
Thank you.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.668
/ had a crush on you.

39:50.972 --> 39:54.715
Let's solve question 3.

39:55.351 --> 39:56.932
Today's the 23rd, right?

39:57.687 --> 40:02.101
Then student number 13
and 33 can come up.

40:31.012 --> 40:32.968
Norwegian forest

40:38.937 --> 40:39.937
hey!

40:40.104 --> 40:43.312
Stop drinking the herbal decoction.
You'll age faster.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.139
It’s okay. I'm baby-faced.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.731
You like her, don’t you?

40:50.657 --> 40:53.364
- Who?
- Lim soo—a.

40:54.661 --> 40:55.992
It’s so obvious, fool.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.494
- You're crazy.
- Want me to help?

40:58.539 --> 40:59.403
Help with what?

40:59.457 --> 41:00.993
Answer quickly.
Want help?

41:02.627 --> 41:03.116
Forget it.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.831
I'll ask one last time.
Want help?

41:07.256 --> 41:08.917
Fine. Good luck, bro.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.180
I don’t believe this!

41:15.306 --> 41:16.842
According to my calculations,

41:17.976 --> 41:20.718
lim soo-a loves you way more
than you do.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.185
Woo-Jin loves soo-a, 9%.

41:24.023 --> 41:27.231
Soo-a loves woo-Jin, 98%!

41:28.277 --> 41:29.277
No way!

41:29.487 --> 41:32.149
So just act cool
and uninterested around her.

41:32.198 --> 41:34.484
Ask her for a pen,
then she'll say she has one.

41:34.492 --> 41:35.698
Then be chic and say,

41:37.537 --> 41:39.152
"lend me an eraser’, you know!

41:39.330 --> 41:42.618
Then she'll think you're funny
and laugh.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.866
Just go with the flow, bud.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.409
- You get me?
- Yeah.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.377
- You trust me?
- I do.

42:00.143 --> 42:01.223
Hey, lim soo-a?

42:03.312 --> 42:04.973
- Got a pen I can...
- No.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.234
I knew it.

42:09.610 --> 42:13.194
She's good at hiding her feelings.

42:15.116 --> 42:17.653
You can’t rush things.

42:18.453 --> 42:21.570
If she likes you more,
she’ll come on to you.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.456
Ready?

42:28.212 --> 42:31.875
One, two, three! One, two!

42:36.429 --> 42:37.885
Jeong woo-Jin!

42:39.432 --> 42:40.432
Hey!

42:40.641 --> 42:42.051
Can't you get it right?

42:42.560 --> 42:43.560
Sorry, sir.

42:44.353 --> 42:46.264
It’s because I'm left-footed.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.681
No, you're a left foot klutz!

42:50.818 --> 42:52.058
Again!

42:57.533 --> 42:58.533
It wasn’t me!

42:59.494 --> 43:00.494
So0-37?

43:01.579 --> 43:03.570
- Are you left-footed?
- Yes.

43:04.415 --> 43:08.624
Can you partner up with
the left foot klutz?

43:51.671 --> 43:52.671
One!

43:53.798 --> 43:55.163
It’s dirty. Oh no!

43:55.258 --> 43:56.258
It's okay.

43:58.970 --> 43:59.834
What's going on?

43:59.929 --> 44:00.929
Oh no!

44:08.229 --> 44:14.691
We didn’t talk again
until our last day of school.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.185
You're not still...

44:18.322 --> 44:20.313
You're over her, right?

44:20.741 --> 44:21.741
Shut up.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.984
What? You're not?

44:25.538 --> 44:27.244
- You're crazy!
- Stop it!

44:27.331 --> 44:31.165
- You liked her for 3 years?
- Shut up!

44:31.210 --> 44:32.325
You have a crush!

44:32.587 --> 44:33.587
Stop!

44:37.049 --> 44:38.084
You didn’t write yet.

44:44.599 --> 44:45.599
Me?

44:46.350 --> 44:47.350
Right.

44:49.353 --> 44:52.186
- Woo-Jin? Got a pen?
— sure.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.452
You can write too, if you want.

45:10.875 --> 45:11.875
Me?

45:14.295 --> 45:15.295
Do it.

45:16.839 --> 45:17.839
Sure.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.142
Soo-a likes me?

45:36.901 --> 45:38.437
My pen!

45:39.946 --> 45:44.235
/ went fo a nearby college
for swimming.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.444
You went to a university in Seoul.

45:46.744 --> 45:50.453
Don’t worry.
Friends matter more than love.

45:51.999 --> 45:53.990
What! I don’t like her!

45:54.001 --> 45:55.001
You liar!

45:55.127 --> 45:56.127
Don’t remember?

46:04.095 --> 46:05.801
- It'll come...
- Mom!

46:06.681 --> 46:07.681
Mom!

46:09.016 --> 46:12.508
I thought you went back
to cloudland.

46:16.482 --> 46:18.097
He means the hospital.

46:21.779 --> 46:25.988
So, we didn't date
during high school?

46:27.576 --> 46:28.576
No.

46:29.328 --> 46:34.197
Then I tried to call you in our first
summer break from college.

46:46.012 --> 46:47.012
Hello?

46:48.264 --> 46:49.800
No! Call her back!

46:49.890 --> 46:51.221
- Call her!
- Move!

46:53.185 --> 46:54.185
Stupid!

46:56.022 --> 46:58.980
After summer break,

47:00.860 --> 47:04.728
/ wanted fo call you
auring winter break.

47:05.448 --> 47:07.279
Military duty notice

47:07.616 --> 47:11.529
just like that,
another 2 1 years went by.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.095
Hello?

47:30.765 --> 47:31.765
Hello?

47:32.558 --> 47:33.558
Hang up!

47:33.976 --> 47:34.976
Hello?

47:37.563 --> 47:38.563
You crazy!

47:40.024 --> 47:41.024
Who ’s this?

47:41.400 --> 47:42.400
Hang up!

47:42.818 --> 47:44.729
- Hello?
- It's jeong woo-Jin!

47:48.616 --> 47:51.608
Sung-hyeon high class of 92,
jeong woo-Jin.

48:02.088 --> 48:05.876
Hi. It's jeong woo-Jin.

48:07.385 --> 48:10.252
You probably don’t remember.

48:12.473 --> 48:18.218
Do you have my pen
you took on the last day of school?

48:18.771 --> 48:20.227
It’s really expensive.

48:41.293 --> 48:43.124
Hong-gul!

48:45.923 --> 48:48.130
What do want?
Just say anything!

48:48.259 --> 48:49.840
I'll do anything you say!

48:50.136 --> 48:52.468
- Let me style you up.
- Style me?

49:18.247 --> 49:20.408
I'm not late. You came early.

49:21.750 --> 49:22.750
I know.

49:24.086 --> 49:26.452
It’s hot.
Why didn’t you wait inside?

49:28.132 --> 49:29.918
We promised to meet here.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.174
Right. Sorry.

49:33.971 --> 49:34.971
It's okay.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.357
- Thanks.
— sure.

49:56.285 --> 49:57.570
It’s hot, so...

50:00.706 --> 50:01.706
Take care.

50:04.543 --> 50:06.955
Okay. Bye.

50:12.676 --> 50:13.836
Hey, soo-a!

50:16.514 --> 50:18.379
Aren’t you thirsty?

50:21.185 --> 50:22.185
I am.

50:52.258 --> 50:55.000
Do you live in dorm at school?

50:55.469 --> 50:56.925
No, I live alone.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.883
That must be tough.

51:01.934 --> 51:03.219
It’s better than home.

51:03.978 --> 51:05.468
No one tells me what to do.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.225
That’s true.

51:09.275 --> 51:12.438
You can feel trapped
living at home.

51:12.570 --> 51:16.483
I hate it when people
tell me what to do.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.690
It's up to me whether
I work or lurk.

51:28.627 --> 51:31.585
Work or lurk?
That's a good one.

51:31.964 --> 51:33.420
Why are you laughing?

51:36.218 --> 51:37.218
Well...

51:43.142 --> 51:44.723
Norway

51:46.228 --> 51:47.593
do you like Norway?

51:48.772 --> 51:51.138
Yes, I love it.

51:52.109 --> 51:55.818
The great forests and fjord coasts.

51:56.071 --> 51:57.151
Do you like it too?

51:58.240 --> 51:59.240
Not really.

52:03.787 --> 52:07.780
Didn't you read
a book called 'Norwegian forest’?

52:08.459 --> 52:09.459
What?

52:14.965 --> 52:16.705
That's just a novel.

52:17.176 --> 52:19.383
It has nothing to do with Norway.

52:23.057 --> 52:24.388
Actually,

52:24.767 --> 52:28.601
I bought it thinking
it’s about Norwegian forest cats.

52:29.647 --> 52:32.354
It’s a type of cat?

52:32.691 --> 52:33.897
Yes, it’s so cute.

52:35.694 --> 52:40.028
It's a cat that looks like a dog
and is friendly too.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.281
It has really long, soft fur.

52:42.368 --> 52:43.368
Really?

52:43.577 --> 52:46.910
- Do you like cats?
- Of course, I love dogs too.

52:47.122 --> 52:48.122
Me too.

53:03.847 --> 53:04.962
Your bus is here.

53:08.477 --> 53:09.887
I'll see you off and then go.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.524
It's packed.
I'll take the next one.

53:24.910 --> 53:25.910
Really?

53:33.335 --> 53:34.245
It’s the last bus.

53:34.294 --> 53:35.909
Are you getting on or not?

53:36.839 --> 53:38.079
I'll be going then.

53:43.762 --> 53:48.051
I won't be back from Seoul
until winter break.

53:59.987 --> 54:01.352
Look over there!

54:07.119 --> 54:08.950
He’s so fast!

54:11.582 --> 54:14.415
Mister! Wait! Stop!

54:18.505 --> 54:20.712
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, sir!

54:23.802 --> 54:24.802
Lim soo-a!

54:25.220 --> 54:26.220
Yes?

54:27.598 --> 54:29.884
Can I write you letters?

54:33.771 --> 54:35.432
He's wearing color mousse?

54:49.536 --> 54:51.777
They must be dating.

54:54.124 --> 54:56.080
Come on! Get off the bus!

54:56.126 --> 54:57.126
Let's gol!

54:57.294 --> 54:58.909
This isn’t Hollywood!

54:58.921 --> 55:00.582
= I'll write!
- Get off!

55:16.063 --> 55:18.679
Rainy season
expected to last longer

55:24.571 --> 55:27.438
- you look so happy.
- Pardon?

55:28.075 --> 55:29.690
Ah, well sort of.

55:31.912 --> 55:34.369
Are you dating someone?

55:36.750 --> 55:38.615
No, why would 1?

55:45.884 --> 55:47.499
You look so happy.

55:48.929 --> 55:49.929
My buttons...

55:50.556 --> 55:51.841
It’s so hot.

55:53.433 --> 55:54.639
Are you stupid?

56:03.652 --> 56:04.892
It’s raining again.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.520
It’s all my dad’s fault.

56:09.074 --> 56:10.074
Why?

56:10.784 --> 56:14.527
Whenever his car gets washed,
it rains the next day.

56:15.497 --> 56:16.907
But he washes it everyday.

56:18.625 --> 56:19.956
Our car is American.

56:20.836 --> 56:22.451
Lucky you!

56:24.548 --> 56:26.334
You're like my dad.

56:27.551 --> 56:28.256
How?

56:28.385 --> 56:31.877
He likes rainy days too.
Says cigarettes taste better.

56:33.223 --> 56:33.757
What about you?

56:34.016 --> 56:35.222
I hate "em.

56:35.893 --> 56:36.257
Why?

56:36.894 --> 56:39.601
My hair gets curlier.

58:03.021 --> 58:05.683
Woo-Jin! Wait!

58:06.149 --> 58:07.935
That's what's urgent?

58:08.026 --> 58:09.186
What's more urgent than this?

58:09.319 --> 58:10.319
Forget it.

58:12.698 --> 58:13.904
You saw how pretty she is!

58:14.866 --> 58:16.322
She's really classy.

58:16.994 --> 58:18.074
I don’t care!

58:21.415 --> 58:22.825
I smell something suspicious.

58:25.877 --> 58:26.957
You're in love.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.253
What in the world?

58:31.675 --> 58:34.382
Don’t act naive!
Who is she?

58:36.722 --> 58:37.722
Forget it.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.471
It’s written on your face!
Who is she?

58:40.726 --> 58:43.593
I won't tell anyone.
Who is she?

58:44.146 --> 58:44.931
Let go!

58:44.938 --> 58:49.352
I won't steal her from you!
Friendship over love, remember?

58:58.785 --> 58:59.399
Actually,

58:59.453 --> 59:01.318
if you say soo-a came back,
you're dead!

59:02.956 --> 59:05.163
Be more creative than that!

59:05.709 --> 59:07.574
That's all you can think of?

59:08.003 --> 59:11.086
Say she lost her memory
why don’t you!

59:13.216 --> 59:14.216
I gotta go.

59:16.470 --> 59:17.505
What's with him?

59:21.516 --> 59:24.053
I'm sorry.
My friend's a little shy.

59:24.811 --> 59:26.676
I can’t stand guys like him.

59:28.940 --> 59:32.023
Still, he’s my friend.

59:32.569 --> 59:35.652
I meant him.

59:44.122 --> 59:47.455
Must have a reason
for being alone.

59:48.710 --> 59:49.710
Right.

59:49.795 --> 59:50.875
That's gross.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.171
I meant you.

59:57.427 --> 59:58.427
Me?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.547
I see there's only
one woman for life.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.674
Is it written on my face?

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.684
Well, I am a romanticist.

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:11.430
Not you.
I meant your friend.

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:22.233
Too bad for such
a handsome face.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:26.577
Right. Woo-Jin is pretty
good looking.

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:30.039
No, I meant you.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:31.491
What?

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
You.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.380
Me?

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.171
Look! It's huge!

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:47.351
What is it?

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:48.929
I can hear better now!

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:50.894
This came from your ear?

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.139
- Come here, dad.
- Why?

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.319
Lie down.

01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:58.351
Come on!

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.270
- But...
- Lie down!

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:12.126
Dad!

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:33.641
He has some earwax too.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:40.523
You have big ear holes
just like dad.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:45.115
There's so much.

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:48.787
Be careful...

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:51.749
Woo—-Jin!

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:54.954
Woo—-Jin!

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.212
Jeong woo-Jin!

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:00.830
What?

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:04.752
My buddy, jeong woo-Jin!

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:05.846
Hong—-gu?

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.296
What's with you?

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:11.137
Buddy!
If you die, I can’t live!

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:13.051
Why would I die?

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.520
Ji-ho! Mommy's here!

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:16.847
You're drunk!

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:22.353
- Go home and sleep!
- I came back from cloudland!

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.530
Go!

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.366
Sorry, bro.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.660
Damn.

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:29.828
Stop.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:30.535
Why?

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.695
You can’t go out.

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.209
Why not?

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.540
Uncle hong—-gu is weird.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:40.839
How?

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.544
His head is too big.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:49.932
Where'd he go?

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.062
Hey!

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:59.231
Soo-a wasn’t strikingly beautiful!

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:02.226
Her body wasn’t to die for!

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:06.907
Why you little!

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.532
Let’s talk outside!

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.123
Holy cow.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.789
Remember? This is hong—gu.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.039
He's quite drunk.

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:24.339
Would you like some water?

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.421
Why is he dressed like a penguin?

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:29.927
Soo-a!

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:33.723
I'll explain everything!
Don’t tell anyone!

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:34.466
Soo-a! It's soo-a!

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.477
Your water.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:39.273
Hong-gul!

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.151
Stay back!

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:43.936
Our father, who art in heaven,

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.774
hallowed be thy name.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.025
Thy kingdom come,

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.072
thy will be done...

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:53.322
On earth, as it is in heaven?

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:56.957
I'm so sorry!

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.292
Forgive me!

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:00.788
I won't do it again!

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.787
I won't set him up
on blind dates again!

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:05.497
So please forgive me!

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.589
I'm s 0 Rey!

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.680
Be careful!

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.258
He's not a bad guy.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.060
- So?
- What?

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.142
You said you'd write.
Then what?

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.695
What?

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:31.905
I wrote to you.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:48.944
Are you cold?

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:51.989
What?

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:54.273
Are your hands cold?

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:56.243
No.

01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:58.986
Why wear gloves?

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.083
I"m not.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:43.681
Were you in a fight?

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.136
I fell off my bike.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:51.188
You need ointment.
I'll get it.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:52.568
It's okay.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:56.232
Let's just stay like this.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.119
Mom?

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:07.739
No cheating, okay?

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:30.765
Are we there yet?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.274
Almost.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.243
We're here.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:46.868
There's nothing here.

01:08:58.343 --> 01:08:59.423
This is it?

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:20.697
Look!

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.613
It’s a movie theater!

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.122
Here.

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.051
Wanna see?

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.025
Wow!

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:04.282
Turn up the volume.

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:05.826
Sorry.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.280
= I'll turn it off.
- What?

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:10.247
Fine.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.869
- Let's watch together!
- It’s too small to share.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:15.961
Wait!

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:18.630
I can see.

01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:25.884
- This way.
- Wait.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.661
What's this?

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:41.433
My birthday

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:56.496
don’t lie!

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.950
= I'm not lying!
—- seriously?

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:02.250
Don’t tell anyone, okay?

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:04.462
Promise.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:14.424
I made this?

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:16.304
Mommy penguin in cloudland

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:29.485
it’s cute.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.571
Barley, barley, rice!

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:38.288
You're so good!

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.416
Again!

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.124
- I'll catch you!
- Barley...

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.169
Ready, go!

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:46.205
Ji-ho! Don’t hurt mommy!

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:47.797
Stop!

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.297
Ji-ho! Wait! I'm sorry!

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:51.878
- Stop!
- Don’t hurt daddy!

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:55.845
Give up! Give up!

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:57.509
We give up!

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:13.604
What's that for?

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.483
It’s to ask for more rain.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.079
Why?

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:23.039
Because I love rainy days!

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:37.795
Dad!

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:38.921
What?

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.257
What's that over there?

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:42.394
Jeong woo-Jin!

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:47.559
Ji-ho! We did it!

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.151
Let's run away!

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:11.041
- Are you having fun?
- Yes!

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:14.374
- But it must be hard on dad.
- No, I'm fine!

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.757
Dad! Faster!

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:20.845
Faster? Let's go!

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:23.932
Ji-ho, we're home!

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:26.306
What did you wish for?

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.304
It’s a secret.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.480
Let's go wash up.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.029
Dad!

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:37.157
Dad!

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.618
Why didn’t you tell me?

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.965
What's wrong with you?

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.344
When did it start?

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:14.271
After our third date...

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.450
Go on in. Take care.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:26.289
Wait.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:34.041
Good luck at the national tryouts.
Don’t get hurt.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:40.584
I mean...

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:41.846
Here.

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:14.933
Doctors said there’s a problem
in my brain that controls hormones.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:21.444
/ got treatment and pills,
but it only got worse.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:27.484
If I got nervous or strained myself,
I kept fainting.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:31.074
Everything came fo an end.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:37.372
Not just swimming,
but living a normal life too.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:41.379
How’ve you been?

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.058
Fine...

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:52.550
You've lost weight.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:56.773
No, I didn’t.

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:03.898
- I heard you quit swimming.
- Yeah.

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:05.566
I have other plans.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:15.705
Is something wrong?

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:20.961
It’s nothing like that.

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:22.257
Please...

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:24.915
Don’t hide it.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.170
I'm not hiding anything.

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:32.844
I just... don’t like you anymore.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:40.858
Really?

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.021
Just your feelings for me changed?

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:47.525
Nothing bad happened, right?

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:48.950
Of course not.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:52.704
That's good.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:01.796
From now on...

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.131
Let’s not see each other.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:30.607
Then for a year,
I struggled to get over you.

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:32.987
But I couldn ’t.

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:38.452
It was really dangerous
for me to go to Seoul alone,

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:42.709
but if I could see you
just one more time,

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:45.037
/ didn’t care what happened fo me.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:22.659
Seeing you happy,
I felt a little sad.

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.415
Still, I was relieved.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:29.628
/ knew that I wasn’t
good enough for you.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.875
I realized that for good.

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:39.221
We didn’t talk to each other after that.

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.182
/ thought it was completely over.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.977
Then a few months later...

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:51.447
Hello?

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:56.950
I mulled over whether
to meet you again or not.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:01.789
My head was telling me to go back,

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.785
but my heart would not let me go.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:24.564
Soo-a...

01:22:25.732 --> 01:22:26.732
Don’t worry.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.357
We'll be fine. It’s meant to be.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.273
Soon after, I proposed to you.

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:17.652
You said you hated
every minute we're apart,

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:21.990
and asked me to propose soon.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.365
That means I proposed first.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:31.580
If you didn’t say that,
I wouldn't have dreamed of marriage.

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.550
Despite your parents
being against it,

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:43.265
you quit grad school
and married me.

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:48.016
Then, ji-ho was born.

01:23:57.115 --> 01:24:02.701
Can we live happily ever after
like this?

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:08.626
Of course.

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.674
- School concert?
- Yes.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.391
You're in it too?

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.924
Our whole class is singing.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:27.721
Sounds fun!

01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:31.972
- Will you come, mom?
- Of course! I want to see you sing!

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:35.236
You'll go too, right?

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:36.477
Right. Of course.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:37.903
It’s the forecast!

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:40.651
This year’s rainy season
is unusually long.

Why turn it off?

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:51.620
It was too loud.

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:55.291
Hurry up and eat.
You'll be late.

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:14.692
Lim soo-a?

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:16.819
That's me.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.185
Daddy's home.

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.364
It’s too hard.

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:03.021
Don’t hold it tightly.

01:26:03.325 --> 01:26:05.281
Let's practice again.

01:26:05.702 --> 01:26:07.238
Hold it gently and tap.

01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:09.198
Not too hard.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:15.375
See! You can do it!

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:18.500
- You can make it yourself, right?
- Yes!

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:20.630
That's my boy!

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:23.300
Ji-ho! Daddy's home.

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:26.504
Dad! I made fried eggs!

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:29.548
Really? That's awesome!

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:31.429
He's so good!

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:33.180
Wanna try again?

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.772
- Daddy?
- Hmm?

01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:40.817
Did you put up
a four-leaf clover?

01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:42.321
No.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:45.447
There were 8 before.
Now, there are 9.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:48.237
Did mom put it up?

01:26:57.003 --> 01:27:04.125
"You must return
before the clouds roll away."

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:15.553
It will come someday

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:19.435
the day of my dreams

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.854
I'm good at running.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:24.732
I'm the fastest runner
in my class.

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:29.154
I'm going to win a gold medal
at the Olympics.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:36.417
Ji-ho?

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:38.954
Concentrate and do it right.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:44.675
Let's try it again.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.260
Okay son?

01:27:48.805 --> 01:27:49.214
Here.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:52.422
Hold on tight
and shake it twice.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:56.135
Turning it to full power
won't help suck up all the dust.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:00.775
That's good.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:05.611
Don’t use your nails.
Rub gently.

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:07.573
Like this?

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.773
Yes! Scrub everywhere.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.988
That's good!

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:17.364
You two look like emperor penguins.

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:20.875
Why do you say that?

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:26.499
When the mommy penguin
lays an egg and goes away for food,

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:33.301
the daddy incubates it on its feet
for over 2 months in -50 °c cold.

01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:35.557
That’s amazing.

01:28:38.104 --> 01:28:39.310
We have a problem.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:42.021
Take ji-ho. Hurry.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:43.356
Why?

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.522
/ have fo poo.
Hurry! Take him!

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:49.863
The emperor penguin
holds it for two months!

01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:54.242
J-ho’s awake. He’s not crying.
Still, hold it!

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.036
Come on! Take him!

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:02.542
Who am /?

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:04.703
Who am /?

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:06.917
Ji-ho is smiling!

01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:10.250
Look at mommy!

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:13.800
Ji-ho!

01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:20.765
Daddy did it.

01:29:22.148 --> 01:29:24.139
Stay still then.

01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:50.169
You stayed up every night
and did this?

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:55.967
Since I saw her,
I can’t even get mad!

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:57.885
Man!

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:02.139
Will this stop soo-a from going?

01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:04.728
When the rain stops,
doesn’t she have to go?

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:08.354
I have to at least try.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:10.610
Of course.

01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:25.044
Hello?

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:38.005
See for yourself.

01:30:39.809 --> 01:30:43.142
Somebody kept putting soap
on our car.

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:46.304
We caught him
using a scrubbing pad!

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:50.149
Ji-ho? Did you really do that?

01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:56.781
Hold your head up.
Did you do it?

01:30:57.619 --> 01:30:59.200
My son saw him.

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:03.832
Why'd you do it?

01:31:05.919 --> 01:31:08.126
Tell me why you did this.

01:31:12.384 --> 01:31:13.384
You won't tell me?

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:22.682
I'm sorry.
I'll punish him at home.

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:25.594
I'll pay for damages.
Please let me know.

01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:29.848
I'll say this because
I'm worried as a parent too.

01:31:31.194 --> 01:31:34.402
I think ji-ho may have
emotional problems.

01:31:34.823 --> 01:31:38.441
He should get therapy
before it’s too late.

01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:41.610
I'm sure you're doing
the best you can,

01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:46.073
but it shows
when kids don’t have a mom.

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:51.630
I'm sorry.

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:01.765
Let's go.

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:17.483
Why are you crying?

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:22.074
Seo-bin...

01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:31.210
He said if his dad’s car
gets washed, it always rains.

01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:35.581
Mom's not leaving, right?

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:41.090
We can hold her
and stop her from going, right?

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:46.262
We can’t let her go again!

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.431
Classy bakery

01:33:37.821 --> 01:33:38.981
welcome!

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:40.864
How can I help...

01:33:43.493 --> 01:33:46.280
Don’t worry. I won't bite.

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:53.708
I came to ask you for a favor.

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:09.224
What favor, ma'am.
I mean, soo-a.

01:34:09.769 --> 01:34:10.303
First,

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:13.849
I apologize for the not beautiful
and hot body comment.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.809
I didn’t mean it.

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:19.820
What's this?

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:30.908
You won't close this bakery
anytime soon, right?

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:33.458
Why?

01:34:35.461 --> 01:34:38.749
The favor will take a long time.

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:09.369
Ji—ho!

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:12.039
Mom!

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:14.155
Mom!

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:18.243
It’s raining!
Why'd you come out?

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:19.706
Where were you?

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:23.790
I went to uncle Hong-gu’s
to buy a cake.

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:32.556
- There!
- Now, let’s sing!

01:35:33.019 --> 01:35:34.099
Ready, go!

01:35:34.771 --> 01:35:38.639
Happy birthday to you

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:42.938

01:36:02.382 --> 01:36:03.588
Blow out the candles.

01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:12.471
Hurry!

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:22.394
/ wonder how ji-ho
will grow up.

01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:28.655
Since he resembles you,
I'm sure he'll be handsome.

01:36:32.161 --> 01:36:34.573

- Wait up!
- We're late!

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.839
Call an ambulance!

01:38:57.223 --> 01:38:59.214
There is broken glass in there!

01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:02.133
Ma'am! Come out of the water!

01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:30.833
Next up is our adorable
first grade students.

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:35.174
They'll sing ‘the day of my dreams’
in a musical-like way.

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.418
I can’t wart!

01:39:37.763 --> 01:39:40.345
Let’s give them a big hand!

/ believe in my dream

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:04.655
though it may seem hard

01:40:05.124 --> 01:40:09.367
/ close my eyes

01:40:09.879 --> 01:40:14.498
and draw out that day

01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:19.048
though it may be hard

01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:23.757
and I feel like crying

01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:28.432
! Will never give up

01:40:29.065 --> 01:40:33.149
I believe in my heart

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:38.150
it will come someday

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:42.825
the day of my dreams

01:40:43.371 --> 01:40:47.785
how nice it will be

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:52.961
/ picture it in my mind

01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:58.708
I'm good at soccer.

01:40:58.928 --> 01:41:01.135
My dream is to make
the national soccer team

01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:03.720
then play pro soccer in Europe.

01:41:03.975 --> 01:41:04.975

01:41:07.228 --> 01:41:09.435
I'm good at singing and dancing.

01:41:09.689 --> 01:41:10.849
I can act too.

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:15.604
My dream is to become a singer
and a great actress too!

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:18.565
I'll be the best sailor!

I'll draw cartoons.

01:41:21.325 --> 01:41:22.610

I'm good at kart rider.

01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:28.366
I'm high in the rankings.

01:41:28.958 --> 01:41:33.201
Mom promised I can play more
if I become a doctor.

01:41:58.321 --> 01:41:59.321
Ji-ho...

01:42:06.829 --> 01:42:09.286
Ji-ho! Mommy's here.

I'm good at cleaning.

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:51.030
If you vacuum on high,
it can’t suck dust as much.

01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:53.541
Is it dusty?

01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:55.745
/’m good at doing laundry.

01:42:56.629 --> 01:43:00.747
You have to shake off the clothes
then hang them.

I'm good at washing my hair.

01:43:06.305 --> 01:43:06.964
Gently.

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:08.796
When you wash it,

01:43:09.225 --> 01:43:12.058
don’t use your nails to scrub.

01:43:13.312 --> 01:43:15.644
I'm good at cooking too.

01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:21.151
Crack an egg gently
and fry it in medium heat.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:26.860
The egg will break
if you grasp it too hard.

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:39.540
I will protect my dad.

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:42.625
Just like I promised mom.

01:44:05.281 --> 01:44:06.281
It hurts...

01:44:35.227 --> 01:44:36.227
The sun’s out!

01:44:48.491 --> 01:44:49.491
Wait!

01:45:06.884 --> 01:45:07.884
Mom!

01:45:13.682 --> 01:45:14.682
Mom!

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:33.400
"If you miss the last raindrop train,
you can’t go back to cloudland.”

01:45:33.494 --> 01:45:34.494
mom!

01:46:22.585 --> 01:46:23.585
Mom!

01:46:25.754 --> 01:46:26.754
Ji—ho!

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:32.135
Mom!

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.051
How'd you come here?

01:46:34.305 --> 01:46:35.044
Mom?

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:38.138
You're not leaving now, are you?

01:46:44.398 --> 01:46:45.398
Ji-ho.

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:49.438
Listen to me carefully.

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:51.321
Okay?

01:46:55.117 --> 01:46:59.486
It's time for me to go now.

01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:18.554
I'm sorry
for not recognizing you sooner.

01:47:47.628 --> 01:47:50.461
Mom... I'm sorry.

01:47:52.508 --> 01:47:53.508
What?

01:47:53.634 --> 01:47:54.634
Why ji-ho?

01:47:55.052 --> 01:47:56.838
It’s because of me.

01:47:57.346 --> 01:47:59.211
You died because of me.

01:47:59.556 --> 01:48:02.423
What? Who said that?

01:48:02.643 --> 01:48:08.559
I heard your relatives say,
you were sick because of me.

01:48:09.566 --> 01:48:10.566
I'm sorry.

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:13.480
If I knew, I would've been
a better son.

01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:15.186
Don’t say that.

01:48:16.615 --> 01:48:19.322
I was so happy because of you.

01:48:19.827 --> 01:48:20.827
Still...

01:48:20.953 --> 01:48:26.073
If I wasn’t born,
you could’ve lived longer with dad.

01:48:28.419 --> 01:48:31.786
That's not true, ji-ho.

01:48:35.217 --> 01:48:41.213
I would've been the same
even if you weren't born.

01:48:42.057 --> 01:48:43.057
And

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:49.596
I wouldn't have been happy
without you even if I lived till 100.

01:48:53.068 --> 01:48:54.148
Really?

01:48:55.404 --> 01:48:56.404
Of course!

01:49:00.325 --> 01:49:01.906
Mommy and daddy...

01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:10.951
We met for you to be born
into this world, ji-ho.

01:49:11.462 --> 01:49:14.044
So, I'm very thankful for you.

01:49:16.383 --> 01:49:17.748
Really?

01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:19.761
Yes.

01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:23.679
Ji-ho...

01:49:25.642 --> 01:49:31.888
I'll go to cloudland
and keep watching you.

01:49:32.649 --> 01:49:34.014
Grow up well.

01:49:35.486 --> 01:49:37.943
And protect daddy
like you promised.

01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:43.236
I'll never forget you mom.

01:49:45.829 --> 01:49:49.162
Good. Thank you.

01:50:01.303 --> 01:50:04.761
I wonder how ji-ho
will grow up.

01:50:06.975 --> 01:50:11.514
Since he resembles you,
I'm sure he'll be handsome.

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700
Soo-a...

01:50:25.077 --> 01:50:26.077
Hmm?

01:50:27.329 --> 01:50:28.329
I'm sorry.

01:50:29.748 --> 01:50:30.748
For what?

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:35.743
I really wanted
to make you happy.

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.836
Can’t you see I'm happy?

01:50:44.429 --> 01:50:47.671
I was more than happy
just being with you.

01:50:49.351 --> 01:50:51.558
So, don’t ever feel sorry.

01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:54.730
Soo-a...

01:50:54.857 --> 01:50:57.348
Please... wait...

01:51:05.993 --> 01:51:07.358
Take good care of ji-ho.

01:51:10.289 --> 01:51:12.530
Love him lots for me too.

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:16.659
Wait... soo-a... I'm coming.

01:51:17.129 --> 01:51:19.711
Hold on... please...

01:51:20.132 --> 01:51:21.338
Soo-a...

01:51:23.844 --> 01:51:27.257
I'll be right there.

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:34.353
Soo-a...

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:41.527
Soo-a!

01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:43.602
Soo-a!

01:51:49.912 --> 01:51:51.493
Soo-a!

01:51:52.915 --> 01:51:56.783
Stay by ji-ho'’s side
for a long, long time.

01:52:01.757 --> 01:52:04.715
When you feel like
you're a burden to him,

01:52:07.012 --> 01:52:09.128
then come meet me at cloudland.

01:52:14.436 --> 01:52:16.097
I'll save you a spot beside me.

01:52:58.063 --> 01:52:59.063
Dad!

01:53:52.409 --> 01:53:53.649
- Dad!
- Yeah?

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:57.657
You're better than me now!
Let's eat.

01:53:59.082 --> 01:54:00.288
Ketchup!

01:54:02.753 --> 01:54:03.753
Let’s eat.

01:54:14.264 --> 01:54:15.264
There.

01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:17.346
Ji-ho! Let's go!

01:54:43.168 --> 01:54:44.168
Hold tight, son!

01:55:06.191 --> 01:55:08.853
Yay! My dad won!

01:55:14.199 --> 01:55:15.484
Next!

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:20.034
Tense up your belly!

01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:23.791
Next!

01:55:25.043 --> 01:55:26.783
That's good.

01:56:12.007 --> 01:56:14.544
March 2nd, 1990.

01:56:15.969 --> 01:56:18.255
The unthinkable happened.

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:54.629
I started liking someone.

01:56:57.344 --> 01:56:59.835
What a great first impression.

01:57:00.347 --> 01:57:02.429
Late on your first day of school?

01:57:03.058 --> 01:57:04.058
What's your name?

01:57:04.309 --> 01:57:05.309
Jeong woo-Jin, sir.

01:57:05.602 --> 01:57:06.602
Woo0-ijin?

01:57:07.062 --> 01:57:10.099
You're the swimmer-student?
Don’t be late next time.

01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:14.562
And he’s in my class.

01:57:15.403 --> 01:57:16.768
See that?

01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:20.318
If you can swim, go here.
If you can’t, go here.

01:57:20.367 --> 01:57:23.234
Hurry! Come on!

01:57:24.371 --> 01:57:25.486
Stop right there.

01:57:26.623 --> 01:57:27.623
Go!

01:57:27.749 --> 01:57:28.749
Come here!

01:57:28.959 --> 01:57:29.959
Help her!

01:57:34.256 --> 01:57:35.256
Thank you.

01:57:37.676 --> 01:57:38.882
How embarrassing.

01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:48.310
Hey, lim soo-a.

01:57:50.063 --> 01:57:51.678
- Got a pen?
- No.

01:57:53.567 --> 01:57:54.567
Stupid.

01:57:59.072 --> 01:58:03.281
I purposely got the steps wrong
to be his partner.

01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:05.947
Can you partner up with
the left foot klutz?

01:58:14.087 --> 01:58:14.997
It got dirty!

01:58:15.046 --> 01:58:15.660
It's okay.

01:58:15.714 --> 01:58:16.714
I'm sorry.

01:58:21.761 --> 01:58:23.092
What’s wrong with me?

01:58:24.347 --> 01:58:25.928
For three years!

01:58:28.184 --> 01:58:29.765
Come on!

01:58:30.812 --> 01:58:32.677
You can write too, if you want.

01:58:34.566 --> 01:58:36.022
/’m so stupid.

01:58:42.866 --> 01:58:45.778
It was good to be with you
thanks - woo-Jin

01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:51.446
woo—jin still likes...!

01:59:17.525 --> 01:59:18.525
Hello?

01:59:20.111 --> 01:59:21.111
Hello?

01:59:22.614 --> 01:59:23.694
- You crazy!
- Hello?

01:59:25.075 --> 01:59:26.940
What? Hello?

01:59:28.495 --> 01:59:29.495
It’s jeong woo-Jin!

01:59:30.705 --> 01:59:33.321
Sung-hyeon high class of ‘92,
jeong woo-—jin.

01:59:39.798 --> 01:59:41.254
It’s jeong woo—jin.

01:59:42.717 --> 01:59:43.837
You probably don’t remember.

01:59:44.302 --> 01:59:47.339
Jeong woo... who?

01:59:49.432 --> 01:59:50.672
Hey, soo-a!

01:59:54.729 --> 01:59:56.890
Aren’t you thirsty?

02:00:02.237 --> 02:00:03.237
I am.

02:00:05.281 --> 02:00:08.318
Finally, I had my first date
with you.

02:00:11.162 --> 02:00:12.527
And I held your hand.

02:00:13.915 --> 02:00:18.830
We were slowly getting close.

02:00:26.553 --> 02:00:27.553
After a long time,

02:00:28.388 --> 02:00:30.549
/ got a letter from you.

02:00:31.558 --> 02:00:32.702
I can’t see you anymore. Sorry.

02:00:32.726 --> 02:00:34.216
It was just one sentence.

02:00:34.602 --> 02:00:35.637
From now on...

02:00:36.146 --> 02:00:37.261
Let’s not see each other.

02:00:43.737 --> 02:00:50.279
We broke up after 3 dates.

02:00:52.871 --> 02:00:54.407
/ miss you so much.

02:00:56.624 --> 02:00:57.624
Soo-a!

02:00:58.168 --> 02:01:00.580
Wanna go photocopy
last year’s tests?

02:01:01.254 --> 02:01:02.254
Sure.

02:01:02.672 --> 02:01:05.505
- It's raining so suddenly.
- I know.

02:01:06.593 --> 02:01:09.881
- Did you study a lot?
- Not really.

02:01:10.305 --> 02:01:12.762
I hope the same questions
are on our exam.

02:01:14.017 --> 02:01:15.553
I bombed the last one.

02:01:15.727 --> 02:01:16.727
Wait!

02:01:22.692 --> 02:01:23.692
Woo-Jin!

02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:24.860
Jeong woo-Jin!

02:01:37.832 --> 02:01:40.369
You came to see me!

the day you came to see me in Seoul.

02:02:09.197 --> 02:02:10.403
When I woke up...

02:02:10.573 --> 02:02:12.109
Mom!

02:02:12.909 --> 02:02:14.865
- Mom!
- Ji-ho stop!

02:02:15.078 --> 02:02:16.238
- Mom!
- Let go!

02:02:19.207 --> 02:02:22.165
/ had leapt 8 years into the future.

02:02:23.878 --> 02:02:28.121
When I got in the accident
at age 25,

02:02:28.883 --> 02:02:31.215
/ lost my memory.

02:02:31.803 --> 02:02:35.671
Then I went 8 years into the future
and met you at age 33.

02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:39.553
And our 8 year-old son, ji-ho.

02:02:40.645 --> 02:02:45.105
Everything seemed strange
and unfamiliar.

02:02:46.109 --> 02:02:49.067
But I fell in love with you again.

02:02:50.822 --> 02:02:54.440
/ had my first kiss with you.

02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:57.066
We loved each other.

02:02:58.162 --> 02:03:01.245
Then we parted again.

02:03:06.337 --> 02:03:08.123
/ was back in the hospital.

02:03:09.966 --> 02:03:17.304
They said I woke up miraculously
after being in a coma for 6 weeks.

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:24.344
At first, I thought it was a dream.

02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.960
But as time went by,
I remembered more.

02:03:27.817 --> 02:03:33.562
My happy memories with you
felt so unbelievably real.

02:03:38.286 --> 02:03:40.151
/ couldn ’t tell anyone.

02:03:41.205 --> 02:03:44.663
/ couldn ’t even believe it myself.

02:03:45.335 --> 02:03:50.420
Then I thought the future I saw

02:03:50.423 --> 02:03:53.665
could really come true.

02:03:54.719 --> 02:04:01.306
Marrying you and having
a cute son named j-ho

02:04:01.351 --> 02:04:05.560
and living happily together
was a dream come true.

02:04:06.439 --> 02:04:14.107
But I would die at 32
and leave you and ji-ho behind.

02:04:15.907 --> 02:04:17.568
/ was really scared.

02:04:18.868 --> 02:04:21.234
I didn’t want to die so soon.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.244
If I didn’t meet you again,

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:30.919
/’d probably marry someone else
and live on.

02:04:32.256 --> 02:04:36.670
/ thought maybe then
I won't have to die at 32.

02:04:38.096 --> 02:04:39.677
But would I be happier?

02:04:41.516 --> 02:04:43.598
Then / realized

02:04:44.352 --> 02:04:47.344
that I survived
from that accident

02:04:47.897 --> 02:04:54.109
because you and ji-ho waited
desperately for me in the future.

02:05:09.794 --> 02:05:12.206
Hello? Woo-Jin?

02:05:16.092 --> 02:05:20.131
My beloved woo—-Jin and ji-ho...

02:05:21.431 --> 02:05:26.050
/’m coming fo be with you.

02:05:37.572 --> 02:05:38.572
Soo-a...

02:05:39.782 --> 02:05:40.862
Don’t worry.

02:05:41.576 --> 02:05:43.737
We'll be fine. It’s meant to be.

02:06:16.778 --> 02:06:19.770
I loved my time with you.
My life was great.

02:06:33.294 --> 02:06:34.500
Ji-ho! Happy birthday!

02:06:35.129 --> 02:06:36.129
Hi.

02:06:36.339 --> 02:06:37.339
Jeong ji-ho!

02:06:38.299 --> 02:06:40.756
Uncle Hong-gu’s here!
Come out!

02:06:41.302 --> 02:06:44.009
He's busy getting ready
for his first date.

02:06:45.932 --> 02:06:46.932
He asked her out?

02:06:48.017 --> 02:06:49.017
Uncle Hong-gul!

02:06:50.394 --> 02:06:53.261
You're way more handsome
than your dad.

02:06:53.564 --> 02:06:54.974
Thanks uncle hong—gu.

02:07:01.906 --> 02:07:04.272
Happy 20th birthday, ji-ho!
Hope you find true love!

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:05.864
From your mom in cloudland

02:07:15.795 --> 02:07:18.878
now, I'm done keeping my promise
to your mom.

02:07:23.094 --> 02:07:25.255
Thank you.

02:07:27.431 --> 02:07:28.431
Uncle hong—-gu?

02:07:29.142 --> 02:07:32.430
Can you give me a ride into town?

02:07:35.106 --> 02:07:38.598
He's good at using me
just like you.

02:07:41.529 --> 02:07:42.529
Let's gol!

02:07:45.533 --> 02:07:46.533
Wait! Dad!

02:07:48.578 --> 02:07:51.661
I'll make dinner today.
Wait for me, okay?

02:07:52.039 --> 02:07:54.576
Don’t mind me.
Have fun on your date.

02:07:56.919 --> 02:07:58.534
Drive carefully!
- Okay!
