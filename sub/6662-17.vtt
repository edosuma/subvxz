WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:08.008
My name is Bridget.
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.551
Just get up
on the stand

00:09.592 --> 00:10.885
and tell the judge
what you saw.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.262
And we'll
protect you.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.513
BRIDGET: You don't get it.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.932
If Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.268
I ran to my sister Siobhan
for help.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.770
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.272
It was so easy.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.523
I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.067
They all think that I'm her.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.361
Bitches!
Like my new ride?

00:28.403 --> 00:30.780
Please tell me that you
didn't spend your money

00:30.822 --> 00:32.866
we got from my dad
on that.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.160
BOY: Tessa Banner
got robbed last night.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.454
Some guy pounded on her.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.289
Tyler, you're still willing

00:39.330 --> 00:41.249
to take down Andrew
and Martin/Charles?

00:41.291 --> 00:43.251
Siobhan, that flash drive
is the proof we need.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.211
We should go
to the authorities.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.589
Tyler Barrett has promised
the S.E.C. ironclad proof

00:47.630 --> 00:49.132
of wrongdoing
at Martin/Charles.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.593
I don't care what it takes.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.054
Just make sure
Tyler doesn't talk.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.181
Olivia got to me first.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.974
She knew everything.

00:58.016 --> 01:01.061
Olivia and Andrew are
very dangerous people.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.021
What are we gonna do,
Siobhan?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.909
Where have you been?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.577
I've been trying to reach
you for over an hour.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.205
I, uh...

01:20.246 --> 01:22.624
I have been
preoccupied.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.375
Well, I have good news.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.836
Tyler changed his mind.
He's not going to the S.E.C.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.588
He's one his way
back to Paris.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.632
No, he's not, Siobhan.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.300
Tyler's dead.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.970
What?

01:36.012 --> 01:37.931
I waited at the hotel

01:37.972 --> 01:40.016
for Bridget,
and I convinced her

01:40.058 --> 01:42.644
to leave before
she got to Tyler.

01:42.685 --> 01:45.855
But when I circled back
and went to his room,

01:45.897 --> 01:47.649
he was dead.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.734
Somebody murdered him
and took the flash drive.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.862
Are you there?

01:52.904 --> 01:55.448
I told you they would kill
to keep their secret.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.033
ANDREW: You have no clue

01:57.075 --> 01:58.868
what you're talking
about, Siobhan!

01:58.910 --> 02:00.328
I wonder if the police
would feel the same way.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.247
You have no proof
that Martin/Charles

02:02.288 --> 02:03.748
is misappropriating
money.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.250
You're bluffing.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.168
Really? What about
Wesson Accounting?

02:07.210 --> 02:10.964
You remember, that phony firm
you set up on Pratt Street?

02:11.005 --> 02:12.674
You conniving
little bitch!

02:12.715 --> 02:13.925
You stay out of matters
you don't understand!

02:13.967 --> 02:15.593
-Or?
-I'll...

02:15.635 --> 02:18.555
What? Come on, Andrew.
What are you gonna do to me?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.475
I'll kill you.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.811
I mean it, Siobhan.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.313
I'll see you dead.

02:29.023 --> 02:32.318
SIOBHAN: It's what I showed
you in the safe-deposit box.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.737
ANDREW ON RECORDING:
I'll kill you.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.364
I mean it, Siobhan.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.657
I'll see you dead.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.701
Oh, my God.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.619
There's more.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.204
After Andrew
threatened me,

02:43.246 --> 02:45.915
I wasn't taking
any chances.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.209
I hired a private
investigator.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.752
He saw this guy
following me.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.462
Broke
into his apartment.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.339
Turns out the guy
was a hit man.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.924
His apartment
was covered

02:54.966 --> 02:56.926
with pictures of me.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.013
And two days

03:00.054 --> 03:02.015
before I switched
places with Bridget,

03:02.056 --> 03:03.308
he took these pictures
of that same hit man

03:03.349 --> 03:05.393
outside the loft.

03:07.353 --> 03:11.399
Andrew and Olivia killed
Tyler for that flash drive.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.151
And they won't stop there.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.125
No, it's complete rubbish.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.127
The flash drive's a fake.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.962
Maybe Tyler never had

03:33.004 --> 03:34.964
any of our files
in the first place.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.800
The S.E.C. offered him full
immunity for his testimony.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.302
The only reason
they'd agree to do that

03:39.344 --> 03:40.762
is if they believed

03:40.803 --> 03:42.931
the evidence they had was
real and prosecutable.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.557
Is it possible somebody
may have switched the drives

03:44.599 --> 03:45.934
before you got to him?

03:45.975 --> 03:47.769
I don't know. I...

03:47.810 --> 03:49.437
After I threatened
Tyler in the limo,

03:49.479 --> 03:50.688
he raced right back
to the hotel.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.148
I wasn't
that far behind,

03:52.190 --> 03:54.234
but still...

03:54.275 --> 03:56.611
Who else knew why
Tyler was really here?

03:56.653 --> 03:59.113
Malcolm maybe?

03:59.155 --> 04:00.990
No. He never accessed
personnel files.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.492
Tyler Barrett's name

04:02.533 --> 04:04.160
wouldn't mean
anything to him.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.122
But it would to Siobhan.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.540
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.959
Siobhan's not
a corporate spy.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.378
Why do you insist
on protecting her?

04:13.419 --> 04:15.463
We both know
she attempted

04:15.505 --> 04:17.799
to contact Tyler in Paris
and then again in New York.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.677
If Siobhan has
Tyler's flash drive,

04:20.718 --> 04:23.763
you better deal
with her.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.348
Severely.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.314
BRIDGET:
Hey, Malcolm, it's me.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.316
Again.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.694
I know you're
really angry at me,

04:37.735 --> 04:39.946
but, please,
will you just call me back?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.490
Last time I couldn't get
in touch with you...

04:42.532 --> 04:45.076
I'm just, I'm really worried.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.036
OK, bye.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.187
What are you
looking for?

05:19.193 --> 05:21.988
You didn't answer
my question.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.159
My... boots

05:26.200 --> 05:29.495
and a few other things.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.748
I'm sorry
I didn't call first.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.167
I don't know
if you're aware,

05:34.208 --> 05:35.793
but Tyler Barrett
was murdered today

05:35.835 --> 05:37.879
in the SoHo Diamond.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.299
Did you hear what I said?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.761
What does that have
to do with me?

05:44.802 --> 05:48.890
You're in over your head.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.892
Just admit it.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.728
The two of you were planning
to turn me in to the S.E.C.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.773
I already told you
that I wasn't.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.399
I don't believe you.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.903
I'm not having
this discussion.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.571
You're not going anywhere

06:03.613 --> 06:06.699
until you answer
the question.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.576
Where's the flash drive?

06:08.618 --> 06:10.661
What are you
talking about?

06:10.703 --> 06:14.123
Don't play dumb
with me, Siobhan.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.917
I want the truth.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.336
I'm going back
to my hotel.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.471
Did you find the phone?

06:28.513 --> 06:31.933
No. Someone took it.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.811
Solomon, that phone was
my only insurance policy.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.399
Tyler Barrett knew
about the Ponzi scheme,

06:39.440 --> 06:41.275
and now he's dead.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.944
Without that phone,
there's nothing to stop

06:42.985 --> 06:44.946
the hit man from coming
after me again.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.671
[loud rap music playing]

07:01.712 --> 07:06.217
[woman laughing]

07:06.259 --> 07:08.177
[indistinct chatter]

07:11.222 --> 07:13.766
Mmm.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.351
Who's the stalker?

07:29.824 --> 07:32.034
You know,
there's really nothing

07:32.076 --> 07:34.370
like a good cup of coffee
in the morning.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.997
I have the girl add

07:36.038 --> 07:37.999
one and a half
cinnamon sticks now,

07:38.040 --> 07:39.542
and I swear, it really makes

07:39.584 --> 07:41.002
all the difference
in the world.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.295
You should try it.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.588
What do you want?

07:43.629 --> 07:45.715
Nothing. No, I got
everything I need.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.011
You find Bridget Kelly?

07:50.052 --> 07:52.805
[chuckles]

07:52.847 --> 07:56.184
No. and I-I'm not even
looking for her anymore.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.811
No, I'm just, I'm sitting
here 'cause I just wanted

07:58.853 --> 08:01.105
to take one last look
at your club.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.608
I'm not an expert
or anything,

08:03.649 --> 08:06.652
but I think it's gonna make
a really nice doggy day care

08:06.694 --> 08:08.404
when you're gone.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.198
Imagine a couple Pomeranians
running around your office

08:10.239 --> 08:11.616
doing their business.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.326
I think it's gonna be
pretty great.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.127
Agent Machado,
it's Malcolm Ward.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.879
I've decided
to press charges

08:24.921 --> 08:27.048
against Bodaway Macawi
for kidnapping me.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.677
You've reached
Agent Douglas Cupertino

08:31.719 --> 08:33.262
at the Federal Bureau
of Investigation,

08:33.304 --> 08:34.555
New York Division.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.057
Please leave a message.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.642
Doug, it's Vic.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.435
Uh, look, I'm on my way
to the airport now.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.270
Just have Malcolm Ward ready
to travel when I land, OK?

08:41.312 --> 08:42.647
Thanks.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.484
You've reached Malcolm Ward.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.027
Please leave a message
at the tone.

08:48.069 --> 08:51.906
[sighs]
Something's wrong.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.283
This can't just be
because he's pissed.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.077
Wish I could help,

08:56.118 --> 08:59.080
but I think we're just
flying blind here.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.998
MALCOLM: Tracking app.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.875
I'm putting one
on my phone, too.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.502
It'll use the GPS
on your cell

09:04.544 --> 09:06.504
to tell me where you
are at all times.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.839
No, we're not.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.469
It's working.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.304
We can find him
with this.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.306
He put it on
both our phones.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.146
What's he doing there?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.156
ANDREW:
You weren't there, Olivia.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.408
You didn't see her face.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.909
She knew nothing
about the flash drive.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.494
I should've known

09:38.536 --> 09:40.204
this task was too
difficult for you.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.498
Never send a lovesick
schoolboy to do

09:42.540 --> 09:44.041
a man's job.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.502
Oh, enough!
Save it for someone

09:46.544 --> 09:48.129
who still runs at the
sound of your bleating.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.630
As far as
I'm concerned,

09:49.672 --> 09:51.507
that flash drive is
still out there.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.717
Find it.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.719
And what if you're wrong?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.345
What if Siobhan's the one

09:56.387 --> 09:57.972
who brings us down
in the end?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.515
Then you can take great
pleasure in knowing

09:59.557 --> 10:01.225
you were correct
all along.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.524
JULIET: Daddy?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.359
Dad?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.236
Hey!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.946
You're home
from school already?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.865
I've been here
all morning.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.742
It's a little break
in the education system.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.493
I like to call it
"Saturday."

10:22.079 --> 10:25.166
Wait. Did you seriously
not know that I was here,

10:25.207 --> 10:26.751
or, Dad, that
it's a weekend?!

10:26.792 --> 10:29.545
[sighs] Look, I,
uh, forgive me.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.049
I'm...
I'm just miserable.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.426
Are you and Siobhan
still fighting?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.636
Mm.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.180
Daddy, I'm so sorry.
Come here.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.268
What would I do
without you, eh?

10:44.310 --> 10:47.313
Live a lot longer?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.982
[chuckling]

10:50.024 --> 10:51.192
[laughing]

10:53.027 --> 10:56.781
You just... you
miss Siobhan, yeah?

10:56.822 --> 10:59.784
Hey, remember the old
days when she'd just go

10:59.825 --> 11:01.577
and it'd be you and me
in this house all alone?

11:01.619 --> 11:03.120
Yeah, we'd curl up
on the couch

11:03.162 --> 11:04.622
and watch TV
together all day.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.415
Right, and I'd beg you
to change the locks.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.000
Yes, you always said
we didn't need her.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.794
It was going to be
you and me

11:09.835 --> 11:11.504
against the world,
wasn't it?

11:11.545 --> 11:13.506
Yeah.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.257
Daddy?

11:17.426 --> 11:20.429
I love you, but...

11:20.471 --> 11:22.014
I was wrong.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.641
We do need Siobhan.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.434
I mean, I
can't believe that

11:25.476 --> 11:29.105
I'm saying this,
but she makes us better.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.314
[sighs]

11:30.356 --> 11:32.566
-I know.
-OK. OK.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.569
Then whatever
you did, undo it.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.238
Tell her
you're sorry.

11:37.279 --> 11:39.240
Beg for her
forgiveness.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.659
Oh, OK, or even better,
do what that guy

11:41.701 --> 11:43.953
from "Hot Tub Time Machine"
did in that old movie.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.915
We stand outside her hotel
with a radio over your head

11:47.957 --> 11:50.000
and tell the world that
you want a second chance.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.461
I wish I could.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.256
It's just not that easy.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.851
Vic, good to see you again.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.185
Hey.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.187
Where's, uh...
where's Malcolm Ward?

12:10.229 --> 12:12.064
Malcolm never showed.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.275
What do you mean?
Wh-where is he?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.861
I told him to turn
himself in last night.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.070
He was going to testify
against Bodaway.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.655
I checked with all my guys.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.866
Malcolm Ward is not
in protective custody.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.743
Is this a joke? Is...?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.286
My federal witness
goes missing,

12:25.327 --> 12:27.079
you don't even think
to call me?

12:27.121 --> 12:28.664
You were already on a plane.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.670
I want his credit card,
his ATM records.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.214
You get me his phone and
bank statements right now.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.716
We're already on it.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.219
Look, maybe
he just got cold feet.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.106
SOLOMON: If Malcolm's holed
up here, he's using again.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.529
Careful. Careful.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.031
Watch your step.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.537
Sure you don't want
to wait in the car?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.539
Malcolm doesn't know you.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.041
If we're going to get him
out of here,

13:12.082 --> 13:13.709
he needs to know
that I'm here.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.920
Good point.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.314
Wait.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.567
I told you I was
coming with you.

13:38.609 --> 13:42.446
Fine. Let's just
be safe about it.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.366
Don't need for you to
break your legs down here.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.580
-All clear?
-Come on down.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.041
[screams]

13:55.084 --> 13:56.460

13:56.502 --> 13:58.462
Huh? Huh?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.172
[grunting]

14:03.551 --> 14:05.302
Wait. Solomon, Solomon,
I'm OK.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.305
You're paying me a lot of
money to protect you.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.266
You may as well
let me earn it.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.897
BRIDGET: Let me try
Malcolm's cell again.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.986
[line ringing]

14:23.737 --> 14:27.283
[cell phone ringing nearby]

14:29.785 --> 14:31.662
Over there.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.005
BRIDGET: Malcolm.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.885
It's not him.
It's not him!

14:45.926 --> 14:48.137
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.972
Where'd you get the phone?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.432
I found it in a Dumpster
behind a car wash. I swear.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.641
Let him go.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.649
Now what do we do?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.443
Go back to the beginning.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.028
Malcolm's hotel.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.618
[muttering]

15:10.659 --> 15:12.036
Oh, thanks. Good.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.704
OK, cross-reference that

15:13.746 --> 15:16.373
with the train's
outbound passenger roster.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.461
-Hey. What do you got?
-We struck out.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.338
He hasn't used an
ATM or credit card.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.049
From the looks of it,
he's off the grid.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.384
OK. Well, what about
a last known address?

15:27.426 --> 15:28.844
In New York?
We don't have one.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.262
[sighs]

15:30.304 --> 15:32.264
Not looking so good, is it?

15:32.306 --> 15:33.933
Never does till
it does, Vic.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.060
You know that.
Here.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.478
-What's this?
-Hail Mary.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.272
Malcolm Ward's last
place of employment.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.443
Small world.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.615
Well, thank you both
for, uh...

15:49.657 --> 15:51.200
for agreeing to meet me
here on your day off.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.660
I know how busy you are.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.286
It's our pleasure,
Agent Machado.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.789
Um, how can we
be of service?

15:56.830 --> 16:00.376
I have some questions
about Malcolm Ward.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.795
Oh, I can't say
I'm surprised.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.713
Um, we were forced

16:04.755 --> 16:06.590
to terminate
Mr. Ward's contract

16:06.632 --> 16:07.800
last week.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.426
Can I ask why?

16:09.468 --> 16:12.805
I caught him accessing
confidential client files.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.848
He's lucky
I didn't press charges.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.850
Someone talked me out of it.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.311
I'm afraid I have
to shoulder the blame,

16:19.353 --> 16:20.813
Agent Machado.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.607
Uh, as I think you know,
Malcolm has battled

16:23.649 --> 16:25.109
a long history
of drug abuse.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.735
I wrongly believed
that a job

16:26.777 --> 16:28.737
might help him
turn his life around.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.532
When was the last time
either of you spoke to him?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.327
The day he was fired.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.912
Yeah, same
goes for me.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.914
I'm afraid he
disappeared after that.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.125
Siobhan has tried
to reach out to him,

16:41.166 --> 16:43.794
but, uh, he hasn't been
returning any of her calls.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.004
Are you suggesting

16:45.045 --> 16:46.922
that he's in some
kind of trouble?

16:46.964 --> 16:49.341
Well, that's, uh, what
I'm trying to find out.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.845
Um, you have
Malcolm's address?

16:52.886 --> 16:54.304
I'll find it.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.932
OK. Good.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.434
Hopefully, his residence

16:58.475 --> 17:00.102
will provide us
some new leads.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.311
Like what exactly?

17:01.353 --> 17:02.771
What do you hope
to find?

17:02.813 --> 17:04.231
Witness.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.567
Uh, maybe
security camera footage.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.777

17:08.819 --> 17:10.279

help us figure out

21:56.231 --> 21:59.109
Because...

21:59.151 --> 22:02.154
Because you're not
Siobhan Martin, are you?

22:02.195 --> 22:03.739
You're Bridget Kelly.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.874
When did you realize
I wasn't Siobhan?

22:13.915 --> 22:18.879
Well, I knew something was
off from the beginning.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.090
Uh, h-how did I first
contact you?

22:23.633 --> 22:26.011
Why are you asking me
about what you did?

22:26.053 --> 22:27.512
It wasn't till later

22:27.554 --> 22:29.264
that I realized
how right I was.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.558
You see, when I
first started working
for your sister,

22:31.600 --> 22:34.019
I noticed that she suffered
from car sickness.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.438
If she wasn't
looking straight ahead,

22:36.480 --> 22:38.565
she would get nauseous.

22:38.607 --> 22:42.361
And that wasn't
an issue for you.

22:42.402 --> 22:46.698
So I made a few calls.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.034
And once I had
your fingerprints...

22:51.036 --> 22:52.913
[cell phone ringing]

22:52.954 --> 22:54.206
Hello.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.416
SIOBHAN: Henry, eh...

22:56.458 --> 22:58.043
Yeah, you know what,
d-don't ask, Siobhan.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.628
I don't know any more
about the flash drive

22:59.669 --> 23:01.129
than the last three
times you called me.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.923
[knock on door]

23:02.964 --> 23:04.716
You know, is there nothing
else for you to do in Paris?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.468
[knocking continues]

23:09.554 --> 23:12.391
What are you
doing here?

23:12.432 --> 23:14.184
Come on.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.186
I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.938
No, I would be
happier if you...

23:17.979 --> 23:19.147
Here.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.399
would let me
in on your plans

23:20.440 --> 23:21.858
before you acted
on them.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.235
Because the last I heard,

23:23.276 --> 23:24.486
being on the same
continent as Bridget

23:24.528 --> 23:25.987
was too dangerous for you.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.949
Don't be mad at me.
I missed you.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.325
Stop. I'm done.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.952
All right?

23:31.993 --> 23:33.745
I am done being
kept in the dark.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.747
So if you want my help,

23:35.789 --> 23:37.249
you have to
straight shoot with me

23:37.290 --> 23:38.834
about everything.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.964
[sighs]
Fine.

23:44.005 --> 23:47.843
I'm also here because
the plan's changed.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.970
Tyler Barrett can't
help us anymore.

23:52.222 --> 23:55.183
Were you sleeping with him?

23:56.935 --> 23:58.979
Henry, what's
bothering you?

23:59.020 --> 24:00.856
Besides me.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.065
Because we've been
through this.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.692
Yes, I know,

24:03.733 --> 24:05.277
and I don't really care
about what you told me.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.028
I've been thinking a lot
about Tyler Barrett.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.738
And I've been thinking even
more about the story you told,

24:08.780 --> 24:10.574
and it does not
make sense.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.367
So I want you to
tell me again, but this time,

24:12.409 --> 24:14.286
I want you
to tell me the truth.

24:14.327 --> 24:17.414
Were you sleeping
with Tyler Barrett?

24:21.334 --> 24:22.794
Yes.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.798
I want you to leave.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.425
I needed him

24:28.467 --> 24:29.759
to help uncover
the Ponzi scheme.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.179
I know it was an awful
thing to do to you,

24:32.220 --> 24:33.847
and I'm sorry, but,

24:33.889 --> 24:36.600
Henry, it was
a necessary evil.

24:36.641 --> 24:40.145
Wow. Are you serious?

24:40.187 --> 24:42.314
Y-you're gonna stand here
and justify your actions?

24:42.355 --> 24:44.232
You don't know
the whole truth.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.610
No, of course I don't,
because you are a liar!

24:46.651 --> 24:49.070
So what is it, Siobhan?

24:49.112 --> 24:51.281
I cannot wait to hear it.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.074
What could possibly
be so important

24:53.116 --> 24:55.827
that you are willing to
destroy our relationship?

24:55.869 --> 24:59.331
And-and you're gonna set
your own sister up to die?

25:02.292 --> 25:04.628
Bridget killed my son.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.633
CUPERTINO: I don't know.
Looks pretty clean to me.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.593
Come on.
it doesn't add up.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.637
Why would Siobhan Martin's
husband want to get

25:13.678 --> 25:15.639
his hands on surveillance
footage of the night

25:15.680 --> 25:17.432
Bridget Kelly's sponsor
disappeared?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.017
I'm telling you, he knows
more than he's letting on.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.602
And you're sure
it was him

25:20.644 --> 25:21.853
who talked
to the desk clerk?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.230
I went back to the hotel
with pictures.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.648
Yeah, he I.D.'d Martin.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.066
Look, best guess,

25:26.107 --> 25:27.651
Malcolm Ward's
disappearance had something

25:27.692 --> 25:29.069
to do with whatever
he saw in those files,

25:29.110 --> 25:30.654
the ones that got him fired.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.072
Now you're
just fishing.

25:35.992 --> 25:38.662
NYPD says the Martin/Charles
employee--you know,

25:38.703 --> 25:40.163
the one who was found
murdered yesterday

25:40.205 --> 25:42.290
in the SoHo Diamond--
was some whistle-blower

25:42.332 --> 25:44.084
with an S.E.C.
immunity agreement.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.086
Looks like they're launching
their own investigation.

25:46.127 --> 25:48.088
Still think
I'm just fishing?

25:53.718 --> 25:57.639
When I lost Sean,
I lost everything.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.352
Now do you understand

26:02.394 --> 26:04.563
why I hate Bridget
enough to want her dead?

26:06.856 --> 26:08.692
So when you told me
that you and Bridget

26:08.733 --> 26:11.945
willingly swapped places,
that-that was a lie.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.281
Yes.

26:14.322 --> 26:15.907
When Bridget got
sober,

26:15.949 --> 26:18.493
she started
writing to me,

26:18.535 --> 26:20.954
begging
my forgiveness.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.248
I just ignored
her, until...

26:23.290 --> 26:25.959
You found out Andrew
was trying to kill you.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.756
I finally
wrote her back.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.758
I asked her to
come visit me.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.260
Then she told me

26:35.302 --> 26:37.512
she wasn't
ready for that yet.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.306
So the night
before her trial,

26:39.347 --> 26:40.932
I forced her hand.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.146
I paid off a local cop

26:46.187 --> 26:48.940
to scare her
into running.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.152
Convince her
testifying wasn't safe.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.362
When she got
to the Hamptons,

26:54.404 --> 26:56.531
I told her everything
she wanted to hear.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.576
And then we went out
on the boat,

26:59.618 --> 27:04.164
and... I made her
believe I killed myself.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.791
Like, you faked
your own death?

27:08.585 --> 27:10.462
Siobhan, that's insane.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.964
It was the only way
to make it work.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.175
Why didn't you go
to the police?

27:15.216 --> 27:16.760
Andrew Martin has

27:16.801 --> 27:19.512
too much money
and too many lawyers.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.183
Besides, I wanted
him to kill Bridget,

27:23.224 --> 27:25.060
thinking she was me.

27:25.101 --> 27:26.686
It would give me
enough time

27:26.728 --> 27:28.688
to get all the evidence
that I needed.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.774
And then I could
reveal that I was alive

27:30.815 --> 27:32.651
and turn it over
to the police.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.653
Proving that Andrew had
motive to want you dead.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.571
But how did you know
it would work?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.990
I mean, it was predicated
on you knowing

27:39.032 --> 27:41.201
that Bridget would
step into your shoes.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.787
She was desperate.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.705
Bodaway Macawi
wanted her dead.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.999
In my mind, she
didn't have a choice.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.584
And we always
used to pretend

27:49.626 --> 27:51.670
to be each other.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.297
Church, school.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.924
Even our parents
couldn't tell us apart

27:55.965 --> 27:57.384
if we didn't
want them to.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.511
Yeah, but you were
kids then.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.390
Doesn't matter.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.599
[sighs]

28:04.641 --> 28:08.019
Even after
all these years

28:08.061 --> 28:11.606
and all this
time apart,

28:11.648 --> 28:14.359
I know Bridget better
than she knows herself.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.820
And you were willing
to let her die.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.613
She deserves it

28:18.655 --> 28:20.990
for what she did
to Sean...

28:22.659 --> 28:25.370
and what she did
to Gemma.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.581
Henry, you know
I'm right.

28:28.623 --> 28:31.751
I'm married to a man
that would kill me

28:31.793 --> 28:33.837
to protect
his own crimes.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.589
And I'm pregnant
with your twins.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.260
When Bridget dies,
it will fix everything.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.511
Oh, Siobhan...

28:41.553 --> 28:42.929
No.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.640
I will not let Andrew Martin
or anyone else stand

28:45.682 --> 28:48.268
in the way of my chance
at happiness with you.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.936
After all the sadness

28:49.978 --> 28:51.646
that I've had
in my life,

28:51.688 --> 28:53.940
I deserve it.

28:53.982 --> 28:57.736
Please let me have it.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.784
OK, so now what?

29:04.826 --> 29:08.663
Well, that's up to you.

29:08.705 --> 29:12.208
Well, everyone that has
figured out my secret

29:12.250 --> 29:14.669
has used it
against me, so...

29:14.711 --> 29:17.088
why would I believe
you'd be any different?

29:17.130 --> 29:21.801
Because Siobhan Martin
writes my checks.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.679
No Siobhan, no checks.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.140
So the way I see it,

29:27.182 --> 29:29.517
we both have an interest
in keeping you alive.

29:29.559 --> 29:32.061
[cell phone chiming]

29:43.031 --> 29:45.116
Well, then sit tight.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.202
'Cause it's just about
to get interesting.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.631
[computer chimes]

30:09.057 --> 30:10.975
[laughs]

30:12.602 --> 30:14.604
TESSA: Hey.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.731
You said 7:00,
right?

30:18.233 --> 30:19.943
Mm-hmm, yeah.
It's perfect timing.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.945
Here you go.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.571
Thanks.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.156
Come here.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.744
How are you feeling?
You look...

30:29.786 --> 30:32.580
Like the bitch who got
what she deserves, yeah.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.541
I know. You were right.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.960
I should've never
bought the SUV.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.380
No, look, nobody deserves
what happened to you.

30:40.421 --> 30:43.174
And I know that we're
not best friends,

30:43.216 --> 30:45.885
but I am really glad
that you're OK.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.596
Thanks.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.265
[computer chimes]

30:52.767 --> 30:55.228
[giggles]

30:55.270 --> 30:56.980
Uh, s-so are you, um--

30:57.021 --> 30:58.606
you gonna come back
to school on Monday?

30:58.648 --> 31:00.191
Uh, you know,
I don't know yet.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.360
I'm just kind of happy to
be out of the hospital.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.195
Yeah.
[computer chimes]

31:04.237 --> 31:05.405
[laughing]

31:05.446 --> 31:06.948
Damn, girl.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.992
Who is all up
in your business

31:09.033 --> 31:10.702
that he won't
leave you alone

31:10.743 --> 31:12.203
for five minutes to have
a mochachino with me?

31:12.245 --> 31:13.997
I die. He's so hot.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.707
But I can't let him know
that I think that,

31:15.748 --> 31:17.709
because it's totally obvious
that he has a million girls

31:17.750 --> 31:19.377
that are in love with him.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.588
So when did you
meet him?

31:21.629 --> 31:23.423
Today.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.466
At my mom's hotel,
by the elevator.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.427
Yeah, but who cares?

31:27.468 --> 31:29.554
Why are we talking about this
when we can be looking at him?

31:29.596 --> 31:31.222
Yeah, he doesn't even know

31:31.264 --> 31:33.474
that I've totally
stalked his Web page.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.727
His name is Cash Chilton.

31:35.768 --> 31:39.439
Please take a look at
how beautiful he is.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.107
[laughs]

31:44.319 --> 31:45.695
Oh, my God.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.196
Why? What's the matter?

31:47.238 --> 31:49.115
[Tessa gasping]

31:54.454 --> 31:56.998
That tattoo.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.875
That's the guy
who beat me.

32:00.793 --> 32:03.171
Oh, my God.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.263
[knock on door]

32:12.305 --> 32:14.557
JULIET: Mommy? Mom,
open up. Let me in.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.142
Mom?

32:16.184 --> 32:17.810
Angel, what's wrong?

32:17.852 --> 32:19.479
Mom, we got
to get out of here.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.939
We're in danger.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.858
Juliet, calm down.
What happened?

32:23.900 --> 32:26.402
Mom, the guy who attacked
Tessa is coming after us.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.237
He approached
me downstairs

32:28.279 --> 32:29.447
this m--

32:30.740 --> 32:33.076
JULIET: OK, tell me
what happened.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.702
My boss pissed me off,

32:34.744 --> 32:36.496
so I punched a hole
in her wall.

32:36.537 --> 32:39.082
Oh, my God.

32:39.123 --> 32:40.708
You lied to me.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.336
Mr. Carpenter
didn't attack Tessa.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.380
Honey, honey,
you just hear me out.

32:45.421 --> 32:48.091
You paid Cash Chilton to
kick the crap out of her.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.094
No, no, I paid him
to scare her.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.304
And that idiot
took it up a notch.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.056
And that's why I only
paid him half the money.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.474
You're crazy.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.309
Juliet, no! You
don't understand.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.103
I had to do it
to protect you.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.896
OK, right.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.648
So stealing her cut had
nothing to do with it?

33:03.690 --> 33:05.149
If Tessa continued to
spend money like it was

33:05.191 --> 33:06.651
going out of style,

33:06.693 --> 33:08.486
the police would've
taken us all down.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.862
I hate you!

33:09.904 --> 33:11.364
Juliet, get back in here.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.449
It is not safe.

33:13.491 --> 33:16.077
If Cash is
interested in you,

33:16.119 --> 33:18.079
it is because he wants
to get back at me.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.081
And he is not gonna give up
until he gets his money.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.209
So we need to
stick together.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.336
I never want
to see you again.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.046
And I wish
Siobhan was my mother.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.513
ANDREW:
Hey, Juliet, it's me.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.849
I'm still at the office,
so don't wait up.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.350
Look, I've been thinking

33:39.392 --> 33:40.935
about what you said
this morning.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.229
And despite everything
that's happened,

33:43.271 --> 33:44.856
I do think it's worth it.

33:44.897 --> 33:47.150
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes

33:47.191 --> 33:49.360
to work things out
for us all.

33:54.699 --> 33:57.326
Siobhan, what
a lovely surprise.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.579
Tell me
about Tyler Barrett

33:59.620 --> 34:01.164
and how you
had him murdered.

34:03.082 --> 34:06.794
[Bridget sighs]

34:06.836 --> 34:08.463
Henry's really late.

34:08.504 --> 34:11.007
Try him again.

34:14.844 --> 34:18.139
SIOBHAN: I can't continue
living this lie anymore.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.433
And I certainly don't like
the person I've become

34:20.475 --> 34:22.894
these last few months.

34:22.935 --> 34:25.104
I don't understand.

34:25.146 --> 34:28.232
I don't love you
anymore, Andrew.

34:28.274 --> 34:29.901
I don't even like you.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.903
Is that clear enough
for you?

34:31.944 --> 34:33.613
I've tried
to make peace

34:33.654 --> 34:35.281
with the man
that you are,

34:35.323 --> 34:37.116
but there's no way
to do that.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.701
You and your
business partner

34:38.743 --> 34:40.620
are criminals.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.372
And you both deserve
to be in jail.

34:57.261 --> 34:58.429
[sighs]

34:58.471 --> 35:00.640
This is ridiculous.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.942
[knock on door]

35:14.278 --> 35:16.239
Did he buy it?

35:16.280 --> 35:18.449
If he doesn't want to kill
her now, he never will.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.203
[sighs]

35:28.626 --> 35:30.962
You're not listening.

35:31.003 --> 35:34.048
Siobhan's gonna blow
the lid off everything.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.883
I need to get out of town

35:35.925 --> 35:38.344
while there's still
a chance.

35:38.386 --> 35:41.055
It's over
for Martin/Charles.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.765
There's nothing you can do.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.688
I'm done. Let's go.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.067
[cell phone chimes]

35:53.109 --> 35:55.486
Too late, Henry.

35:56.946 --> 35:59.282
It's Malcolm.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.873
OK, we're gonna stop at my
place first and get a gun.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.499
We got to play
this safe.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.877
[elevator bell dings]

36:10.918 --> 36:12.086
Siobhan...

36:12.128 --> 36:14.088
I'm so glad you're here.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.507
Why don't you go get the
car? I'll be right there.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.386
Are you moving back?

36:20.428 --> 36:24.307
No, I... just came
to do something.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.100
What's wrong?

36:26.142 --> 36:29.103
Uh, it doesn't--
it doesn't matter.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.397
It looks like
you're busy.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.065
No...

36:33.107 --> 36:35.026
Malcolm might be
in some trouble.

36:35.067 --> 36:37.069
He texted me
to meet him at the loft.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.740
OK, then go.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.742
Sounds like he
needs you.

36:42.783 --> 36:45.119
So do you. He can wait.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.121
Yeah, yeah, so can I.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.457
We can talk
about it later.

36:49.498 --> 36:51.542
Maybe we could talk

36:51.584 --> 36:54.337
about planning a trip
to the beach house

36:54.378 --> 36:57.924
just to get away
from everything.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.427
Yeah, I would like that.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.263
[sobs softly]

37:14.398 --> 37:15.858
Malcolm?

37:20.029 --> 37:21.572
Is this the only way
in or out?

37:21.614 --> 37:23.491
Uh, yeah.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.618
Uh, the terrace
has roof access.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.095
Malcolm?

37:58.943 --> 38:00.403
How did you know
I was here?

38:00.444 --> 38:02.029
Juliet told me.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.198
She said you got
a text from Malcolm.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.702
Siobhan.

38:07.743 --> 38:10.079
Solomon's on the roof.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.289
That's fine.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.207
You sent that text

38:13.249 --> 38:15.167
pretending to be
Malcolm, didn't you?

38:15.209 --> 38:17.211
What are you
talking about?

38:17.253 --> 38:19.505
I won't let you hurt me.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.216
Hurt you?

38:22.258 --> 38:25.469
Why would I
hurt you?

38:25.511 --> 38:27.680
I love you,
Siobhan.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.558
That's what I
came to tell you.

38:30.599 --> 38:34.437
I don't care how much
you hate me right now.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.772
I'll accept it, because I
believe that what we have

38:36.814 --> 38:38.649
is worth the pain.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.654
I'll do anything
for you.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.868
Andrew.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.038
[gun cocks]

38:52.079 --> 38:54.040
[gunshots]

38:55.875 --> 38:57.460
MAN: Let's go.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.297
FBI!

39:01.339 --> 39:02.965
Drop it!
Drop the weapon.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.593
Take it easy, take it easy.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.887
I work for Mrs. Martin.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.221
Back up.

39:09.263 --> 39:10.431
Back up.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.099
What happened?

39:12.141 --> 39:14.852
I was up on the terrace when
somebody hit me on the head.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.645
By the time I got in here,

39:16.687 --> 39:18.397
he'd fired on her.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.691
We exchanged shots,
then he took off.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.276
You got a cell?

39:22.318 --> 39:23.527
Yeah.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.738
Call 911.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.115
Andrew jumped
in front of the bullet.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.828
He saved my life.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.293
[Bridget sniffles]
