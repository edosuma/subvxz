00:38.038 --> 00:39.039
Caspar?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.209
Is that you?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.339
Talk to me, Casp.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.759
<i>I'm here.</i>

00:52.010 --> 00:53.303
Where, Casp?

00:57.307 --> 00:58.308
Where?

00:59.643 --> 01:00.769
I feel you.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.564
<i>I'm right here.</i>

01:05.022 --> 01:06.400
Give me something, Casp.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.280
<i>Jamila.</i>

01:37.514 --> 01:40.184
<i>Four months
after the declaration of alien invasion</i>

01:40.184 --> 01:43.979
<i>and still no communication with their
ships, nor confirmation of their intent,</i>

01:43.979 --> 01:46.356
<i>the refugee crisis continues
with millions seeking shelter...</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:47.941
It's only natural you'd still be grieving.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.444
Grieving?
My dreams aren't going away, Mum.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.488
I know you're gutted,
but you need to be patient with yourself.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.823
I've been patient.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.576
What if they're not dreams?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.163
- You're not making any sense.
- Mum, listen.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.624
Caspar could do things
that don't make sense.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.584
He stopped the aliens with his mind.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.419
A nuclear bomb stopped them things,
not your Jedi shit.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.214
Yeah? So, why are they still here then?

02:10.881 --> 02:12.508
More and more of them every day.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.177
Why our nukes done nothing
to their Death Star, you tosser?

02:15.177 --> 02:16.345
Jamila!

02:17.638 --> 02:19.348
I'm sorry, Mum. But I--

02:19.348 --> 02:22.976
I can feel it. You know, Caspar.
He's out there.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.811
Somewhere, somehow.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.606
He might be the only shot we've got.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.275
Mum, you help save people every day.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.986
What if you had the chance
to save more than a tent-full of patients?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.196
More than a hospital-full?

02:35.113 --> 02:36.865
What if you could save everybody?

02:37.699 --> 02:42.162
Look, the dreams will fade, Jamila.
But I know your spirit never will.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.957
That's the kind of thing
that will save us.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.419
Not magic, not some--
some boy that's gone.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.510
I'm sorry, but he's gone.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.432
I have to go.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.660
What is that?

03:21.660 --> 03:24.246
- I need it! Mom! It's for protection.
- Give it to me!

03:24.246 --> 03:25.330
Are you sure?

03:38.927 --> 03:42.139
You gotta swish it around,
or the barley will go to the bottom.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.266
It's heavier than water.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.542
You made contact yet?

04:11.710 --> 04:12.711
What?

04:13.545 --> 04:14.755
You can keep on looking,

04:15.255 --> 04:17.341
but I don't think
they're coming to the party.

04:18.257 --> 04:23.180
Darien, would you leave my brother alone
with your bad jokes?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.891
It's a party. I can't have fun at a party?

04:27.059 --> 04:28.477
You good, Trev?

04:28.477 --> 04:30.270
All good, just enjoying the party.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.022
Uh-uh. See, now I know you're lying,

04:32.022 --> 04:34.900
'cause nobody enjoys getting stuck
with my husband at a party.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.818
Except you.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.574
Least they brought this family together, right?

04:42.574 --> 04:45.285
I mean, before they showed up,
we never got together like this.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.664
Unless it was a wedding or a funeral.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.958
More funerals than weddings now.

04:55.170 --> 04:59.508
These kids are eating us dry.
Shiona, do you have any more supply packs?

05:01.009 --> 05:02.636
Listen, I can go to the store for you, Auntie.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.388
Oh, we used up all our rations already, baby.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.474
It's fine. I got tickets. You know,
I can round up the supplies, all right?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.142
"Round up the supplies."

05:10.102 --> 05:11.520
You sound like a soldier again.

05:13.063 --> 05:13.981
Old habits.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.359
Well, hurry up now,
or we're all gonna start eating the grass.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.028
Jordan fell in the deep end!

05:20.028 --> 05:22.239
- Help! He can't breathe.
- Jordan!

05:22.239 --> 05:23.615
Jordan!

05:24.616 --> 05:25.993
Jordan!

05:33.000 --> 05:37.004
Jordan! Jordan! Darien!

05:38.088 --> 05:40.340
Come on. Come on. Hey, hey.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.092
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Darien!
- Come on.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.344
- He's not breathing, Darien!
- Please, Son.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.722
- He's not brea-- Oh, my God!
- Breathe. Breathe. Come on.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.599
It's all right. Come on.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.642
Please.

05:51.643 --> 05:52.686
Come on.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.062
Back up! Back up!

05:54.813 --> 05:57.149
Come on. Come on, come on.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.367
Come on!

06:08.702 --> 06:10.913
- Oh, thank goodness!
- Hey. There you go.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.998
- There you go. Hey.
- Uncle Trev?

06:12.998 --> 06:14.416
The hell were you thinking, huh?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.627
Do you wanna help them things, huh?

06:16.627 --> 06:18.337
Do you wanna finish their job for 'em?

06:18.337 --> 06:20.422
- We gotta take care of ourselves! Okay?
- Trevante!

06:20.422 --> 06:22.132
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

06:22.132 --> 06:24.593
Do you hear me? Look at me!

06:24.593 --> 06:26.762
- Look at me!
- No! Trevante, you stop it right now!

06:26.762 --> 06:30.182
That's my boy! You stop it!

06:39.191 --> 06:40.317
I'm sorry.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.028
I'm sorry.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.447
What's wrong with you?

06:50.953 --> 06:52.037
I'm gonna go get the food.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.672
Jordan. Jordan, baby, are you okay?

07:02.381 --> 07:04.716
Are you all right? You're okay?

07:04.716 --> 07:07.094
Okay. All right, all right.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.221
Over here!

08:40.604 --> 08:42.731
Don't you realize
it's for our food supply?

08:42.731 --> 08:45.192
- Here! Here.
- Here!

08:45.192 --> 08:47.819
Here! Me! Here!

08:48.320 --> 08:49.780
Fuck yeah!

09:00.457 --> 09:01.458
Dusters!

09:09.591 --> 09:10.592
Kindling!

09:59.725 --> 10:00.726
Oi!

10:01.268 --> 10:02.269
What you doing?

10:03.395 --> 10:04.938
- Please. I-I mean no harm.
- Yeah?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.024
- So, what's that blood then?
- It's mine.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.817
I cut it on the lock there.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.446
I'm sorry. I just need to feed my family.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.657
We had to evacuate our house
outside London, when--

10:15.657 --> 10:18.202
Yeah, I know. I saw the map.
I know it's gone red.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.538
Like the moon.

10:23.749 --> 10:24.750
What about the moon?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.669
The soldiers were burning spores.

10:28.629 --> 10:32.174
The wind came, turned the air toxic.

10:32.883 --> 10:36.887
The moon went red.
Red all night, like they'd set it--

10:36.887 --> 10:38.263
On fire.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.308
My little girl asked
why the sun was out at night.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.687
She asked if it was scared to be all alone
in the sky during the day.

10:46.772 --> 10:51.318
Please, just a few things for my family.
Please, I beg you.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.695
Take only what you need.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.342
You know the rules.
No talking, 30 minutes max.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.427
Thanks.

12:34.213 --> 12:35.339
Whoa, what's that?

12:35.339 --> 12:36.798
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- <i>God.</i>

12:36.798 --> 12:37.758
<i>Caspar?</i>

12:37.758 --> 12:40.219
<i>Billions of neurons
moving in perfect sync.</i>

12:41.470 --> 12:42.763
<i>Mitsuki.</i>

12:43.555 --> 12:44.848
Them.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.282
Hello?

13:04.535 --> 13:07.663
- Hey. You're back.
- Yo, where is everyone?

13:08.664 --> 13:12.292
Well, you've been gone a long ti--

13:12.292 --> 13:13.585
Oh, wow!

13:14.336 --> 13:18.048
You've been gone a long time,
but the party ended a while back.

13:23.846 --> 13:24.930
How's Jordan?

13:28.934 --> 13:29.935
Shaken.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.606
- We put him to bed about an hour ago.
- Good.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.028
I'm good.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.406
We not gonna talk about it?

13:43.866 --> 13:44.992
What do you mean?

13:46.410 --> 13:48.370
Your outburst. With Jordan.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.621
Man.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.256
I'm sorry.

14:03.886 --> 14:04.887
Learah called.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.640
Or you called Learah.

14:11.727 --> 14:12.728
Oh, she's doing fine.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.438
No, she's still at her uncle's
in Pensacola.

14:14.438 --> 14:17.441
- Still doesn't wanna talk to me, right?
- Well, what do you expect?

14:17.441 --> 14:21.028
I battled my way across the world
just so I can get back to her, okay?

14:21.028 --> 14:22.404
And she loves you for it.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.324
We all do.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.951
But you know you never--

14:29.536 --> 14:30.913
You never really came back.

15:11.203 --> 15:12.704
I'm not judging you, Trev.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.719
Learah told me about the book, the boy.

15:29.179 --> 15:32.307
She warned me
you were still fighting some kind of war.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.103
I see the way you look at the sky.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.690
The way you look out the window sometimes.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.945
I know you're still chasing ghosts.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.738
Some of us just wanna spend

15:46.738 --> 15:51.118
whatever time we got left
on this Earth free from demons.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.703
Pretending they're not here.

15:54.162 --> 15:57.457
And throwing parties,
acting like everything is normal.

15:57.457 --> 16:01.044
I know the world that we're living in,
the world that my boy is living in,

16:02.796 --> 16:05.299
just might not be the same one
that you're in.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.057
I packed your suitcase.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.404
Is this because I yelled at Jordan?

16:30.490 --> 16:33.994
You're kicking me out
because I yelled at Jordan. Seriously?

16:34.578 --> 16:36.872
I know where you go when you leave here.

16:36.872 --> 16:39.458
I know you go searching for answers.

16:39.458 --> 16:44.004
You know it scares me half to death
what could happen to you out there.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.966
So, I say this
with all the love in my heart.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.637
Go.

16:52.513 --> 16:53.722
Go fight your war.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.353
I hope you find what you're looking for.
I really do.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.151
I love you.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.502
Jam? Jam, food's ready!

17:29.633 --> 17:31.176
Jamila.

17:31.844 --> 17:32.845
Jam?

17:47.442 --> 17:49.111
<i>I know this is gonna hurt.</i>

17:53.198 --> 17:55.951
<i>I know this is not
what you wanna be reading.</i>

17:57.661 --> 18:00.664
<i>I'm aware of the dangers out there,
and I know you're scared.</i>

18:01.623 --> 18:02.624
<i>And so am I.</i>

18:04.877 --> 18:07.212
<i>But I can't sit around and do nothing.</i>

18:08.172 --> 18:11.300
<i>I can't hide
and wait for the world to end.</i>

18:11.300 --> 18:14.636
<i>As hard as it may be out there,
the hardest part is leaving home.</i>

18:15.220 --> 18:16.221
<i>Leaving you.</i>

18:18.348 --> 18:20.434
<i>But I'm going out to chase my dreams,</i>

18:20.434 --> 18:22.186
<i>even if they're just dreams.</i>

18:23.687 --> 18:26.690
<i>Because this Jedi shit
might be the one and only thing</i>

18:26.690 --> 18:28.650
<i>that could save our planet.</i>

18:39.036 --> 18:40.245
I'm coming, Casp.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.499
<i>It's your fault, really.</i>

18:44.499 --> 18:47.544
<i>You're the one who taught me
to fight for what I believe in,</i>

18:47.544 --> 18:48.629
<i>no matter what.</i>

18:50.005 --> 18:51.965
<i>And I believe in this.</i>

18:53.091 --> 18:54.134
<i>I love you.</i>

18:54.635 --> 18:55.761
<i>Jam.</i>

20:27.269 --> 20:29.354
The air's not safe.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.607
I need to get to the hospital!

20:31.607 --> 20:33.609
We'll take you to the nearest one.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.736
Not that one. St. Beornwald's?

20:35.736 --> 20:37.779
That area's shut down too.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.156
- Are you hurt?
- Just need to get--

20:39.156 --> 20:41.325
There's a children's shelter
in Hyde Park Corner.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.368
That's not where I'm going.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.204
I said I'm going the opposite direction.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.122
I'm afraid we can't let you go that way.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.132
Oi! Get back here!

21:10.896 --> 21:11.897
Girl!

21:29.540 --> 21:30.582
Spores.

21:33.252 --> 21:34.336
Come out.

21:34.837 --> 21:36.004
You're not safe here.

21:36.713 --> 21:37.714
We can help you.

21:40.884 --> 21:43.262
We can take you somewhere clear.

21:43.262 --> 21:45.889
If you can hear me, come on out.

21:46.598 --> 21:47.850
We just wanna help you.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.605
We're gonna leave a mask here.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.401
You'll need it, love.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.010
Come on, come on.

23:06.345 --> 23:07.513
Give me something.

24:05.320 --> 24:11.493
M, C, U.

24:22.713 --> 24:23.714
Okay.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.682
Oklahoma?

24:35.392 --> 24:37.144
- Latitude...
- Time's up.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.230
Time's up! You gotta go.

24:41.815 --> 24:42.816
Yeah.

24:44.735 --> 24:46.153
Yeah, I do.

26:10.863 --> 26:12.531
Please don't be in there, Casp.

27:18.305 --> 27:21.016
"Caspar Morrow. Bin 8898."

28:00.430 --> 28:01.598
Freak.

28:01.598 --> 28:03.392
- Sir?
- What's going on?

28:03.392 --> 28:06.103
- Caspar? Casp?
- Hey, hey, hey!

28:19.533 --> 28:20.534
I hear you, Casp.

28:22.661 --> 28:23.787
I'm gonna find you.

29:17.341 --> 29:19.968
<i>He's asking for help. I'm asking.</i>

29:19.968 --> 29:21.470
<i>'Cause I can't be here,</i>

29:21.470 --> 29:25.015
<i>all the way across the world,
to be back here again for nothing.</i>

29:25.015 --> 29:26.808
<i>'Cause there has to be a reason.</i>

29:28.101 --> 29:29.102
<i>He's the reason.</i>

29:30.562 --> 29:32.272
<i>That book is a reason.</i>

29:32.272 --> 29:34.149
Hey, what's your name?

29:37.069 --> 29:38.070
Trevante.

29:40.739 --> 29:41.865
I'm Caspar.

29:43.992 --> 29:45.619
Curious Caspar.

29:47.204 --> 29:48.497
Hey.

29:48.497 --> 29:50.374
- What's up, Caspar?
- That's me.

30:32.374 --> 30:33.417
Hey.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.884
Sorry, sir. Road ends here.
No access past this point.

30:41.884 --> 30:44.261
Well, I can see that. Why is that?

30:44.261 --> 30:47.181
It's for your own good. It's not safe.

30:47.181 --> 30:50.017
Oh, well, it ain't safe back there either.

30:50.017 --> 30:54.271
If you head that way for about 25 miles,
there's a ramp for Route 46.

30:54.271 --> 30:56.481
That'll take you south.

30:57.357 --> 30:59.359
There's no dead zones in that direction.

31:00.569 --> 31:03.030
All right. Be safe.

31:03.697 --> 31:04.698
You too, sir.

31:45.239 --> 31:47.491
Sorry, have you seen this family? No?

31:47.491 --> 31:48.784
Have you seen this family?

31:48.784 --> 31:52.704
- Hi. Sorry, have you seen this family? No?
- No, no, no.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.623
Have you seen this-- No.

31:54.623 --> 31:57.626
Excuse me.
Do these look familiar to you? No?

31:57.626 --> 31:58.961
- No? No.
- I'd say no.

31:58.961 --> 32:00.254
Have you seen this family?

32:00.254 --> 32:01.797
No, sorry.

32:01.797 --> 32:03.757
Have you seen this family?
I'm looking for them.

32:03.757 --> 32:08.178
- No? None of them?
- Jamila! Jamila! Fuck.

32:08.178 --> 32:12.140
- Oh, my-- Darwin!
- It's you, it's you!

32:12.140 --> 32:14.643
What the fuck are you doing here?
I thought you were supposed to be

32:14.643 --> 32:16.562
- in the countryside.
- I was, yeah.

32:16.562 --> 32:17.938
- Is your family here?
- They're fine.

32:17.938 --> 32:20.399
- Really.
- Oh, God. Why are you here th--

32:20.399 --> 32:22.776
It's fucking <i>Shaun of the Dead</i> shit.

32:23.485 --> 32:25.404
What's that?

32:30.617 --> 32:31.660
You came looking for Alf?

32:32.619 --> 32:33.620
Is he here?

32:34.413 --> 32:35.831
Jam, what's going on?

32:36.707 --> 32:38.917
He was moved from the morgue
back to the ICU

32:38.917 --> 32:40.627
and then taken to this facility.

32:41.795 --> 32:44.214
- Paris?
- By some order of the WDC.

32:44.214 --> 32:45.799
Hey, Darwin, look at this.

32:47.759 --> 32:51.180
- Yeah, no, I really don't get it.
- Me neither.

32:51.180 --> 32:54.266
But I think, I mean,
I know Caspar's alive.

32:54.266 --> 32:57.102
Jam, when's the last time you slept?

32:57.102 --> 32:58.770
And I think they know he's special.

32:59.354 --> 33:01.481
What-What do you mean "special," though?

33:02.149 --> 33:03.984
I saw it happen, all right?

33:03.984 --> 33:06.403
When the aliens came and we were trapped
in Mum's old hospital,

33:06.403 --> 33:07.487
Caspar talked to them.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.907
Well, they spoke, like,
Eng-English or shit?

33:09.907 --> 33:10.991
No, no.

33:10.991 --> 33:12.326
He got them to stop attacking us.

33:12.326 --> 33:15.829
It was like they could read Caspar's mind,
and he could read theirs.

33:16.538 --> 33:19.833
After he did it, his brain shut down,
but he was still breathing.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.753
He-He was still alive, and this proves it.

33:23.587 --> 33:26.757
I started dreaming of Caspar five days
after I left him at the hospital.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.800
Dreaming? What kind of dreams
are we talking about?

33:28.800 --> 33:31.845
I dreamt of that red moon over London
before I even saw it.

33:32.554 --> 33:34.097
And Caspar, he's always there.

33:35.224 --> 33:36.225
His voice.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.520
Jam, I think of Casp every day.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.730
- Honestly. But--
- I know what I sound like.

33:42.523 --> 33:44.608
Like I've gone completely shit-brain mad.

33:45.108 --> 33:48.445
But this is the surest that I've been
of anything in my whole life.

33:50.572 --> 33:52.074
You don't have to believe me.

33:52.699 --> 33:55.452
I came looking for you because I thought
you should know that he's alive

33:55.452 --> 33:56.537
before I leave for Paris.

33:56.537 --> 33:57.621
Paris?

33:57.621 --> 34:00.165
Yeah, but th-they
shut their borders down, like, ages ago.

34:00.165 --> 34:02.084
- What are you gonna do about that?
- I'll find a way.

34:02.084 --> 34:04.378
I made it this far. I found you, didn't I?

34:04.878 --> 34:07.714
Casp may be the key to ending all this.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.132
The aliens, the invasion.

34:10.217 --> 34:12.636
If he got them to stop once,
he may be our only hope.

34:12.636 --> 34:14.388
But if he can really do all that shit,

34:14.388 --> 34:18.600
then surely the government can get him
to stop all this alien stuff anyway.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.226
We don't know what they're doing with him,

34:20.226 --> 34:22.228
or if they're holding him
against his will.

34:22.855 --> 34:24.231
- You've seen <i>E.T.</i>, right?
- Yeah.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.983
Yeah. Same shit.

34:25.983 --> 34:28.735
I have a feeling he's in trouble,
like proper danger.

34:28.735 --> 34:29.902
Why do you say that?

34:29.902 --> 34:32.656
I can feel it in the way
he calls out to me in my dreams.

34:32.656 --> 34:34.867
Like he wants me to find him.

34:34.867 --> 34:38.620
I wouldn't have left my family
if I didn't know this was real.

34:38.620 --> 34:39.705
So I wanted you to know.

34:39.705 --> 34:42.165
I wanted someone to know
in case I don't make it all the way.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.793
Look, just--
Let's just get some food, Jam.

34:45.835 --> 34:46.837
Cocoa?

34:47.337 --> 34:49.755
- Yeah. Let's get out of here.
- Come on, come on.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.841
In here.

35:05.522 --> 35:06.523
Thanks.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.404
So, we had a chat.

35:15.157 --> 35:16.241
Oh, piss off.

35:16.241 --> 35:18.493
If you think you can stop me,
if you think I've walked all this way

35:18.493 --> 35:21.455
- just to turn back--
- No! We know we can't stop you.

35:21.455 --> 35:23.123
- That's why--
- We're going with you.

35:23.123 --> 35:24.208
What?

35:24.208 --> 35:26.251
We're going with you.

35:26.251 --> 35:27.628
- Yeah, simple.
- Yeah.

35:29.755 --> 35:32.758
W-Wait. N-No. You don't have to do that.

35:32.758 --> 35:35.219
That's not why I came.

35:35.928 --> 35:38.388
- You've got family.
- Yeah, and so do you.

35:38.388 --> 35:42.267
And if you thought we were going
to let you go to Paris alone,

35:42.267 --> 35:44.019
you're a fucking nutter.

35:44.019 --> 35:45.354
We got your back.

35:45.854 --> 35:47.022
You get some sleep.

35:47.523 --> 35:49.358
We'll sneak out just before sunrise.

35:54.321 --> 35:56.573
Casp.

35:57.407 --> 35:58.408
Casp.

37:17.905 --> 37:19.406
What is this place?

38:33.146 --> 38:34.439
What's taking so long?

38:34.439 --> 38:37.109
Alf, it's a massive fucking hatch.
It's not a fucking jam jar.

38:37.109 --> 38:38.902
- Oh, you got-- You got jokes, innit?
- Yeah, I do.

38:38.902 --> 38:41.613
- Give me the torch.
- Could you kindly shut up?

38:41.613 --> 38:42.990
Why is it always me?

38:46.535 --> 38:47.703
Holy balls.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.455
What did I fucking tell you?

38:50.455 --> 38:52.749
YUNGBLUD don't drive cars this fresh.

38:52.749 --> 38:55.335
It's like some David Beckham shit.

38:57.337 --> 39:00.757
Ferrari, Aston, Porsche.

39:01.758 --> 39:04.261
Wicked. Christmas came early.

39:04.261 --> 39:06.763
My name's Bond. James Bo-- Fuck!

39:06.763 --> 39:07.848
Quiet!

39:07.848 --> 39:11.727
She is a beauty, innit?
All right, we're defo taking the Porsche.

39:11.727 --> 39:14.938
- Fucking Porsche. James Bond rides--
- Porsche. Get it right first, before--

39:14.938 --> 39:17.191
Porsche, Alfie.
All right, give me the keys. Come on.

39:17.191 --> 39:18.358
- Get off! I'm not--
- Guys?

39:18.358 --> 39:19.902
- Come on, guys, stop!
- Give me the keys!

39:19.902 --> 39:21.236
- Get the fuck off!
- Give me the keys!

39:21.236 --> 39:23.739
- Let go! Stop it!
- Come on! I'm just gonna see it.

39:24.740 --> 39:27.784
- Look what you've done.
- Someone turn it off. Just turn it off!

39:27.784 --> 39:30.204
- Press anything!
- Can you not see I'm trying?

39:30.204 --> 39:31.914
- I think this key doesn't work!
- Stop!

39:36.877 --> 39:38.462
I th-- I think we're gravy.

39:39.838 --> 39:42.090
What in the holy fuck?

39:43.258 --> 39:44.885
Language, Monty.

39:48.847 --> 39:50.891
We've been on our own since it happened.

39:50.891 --> 39:53.185
Mum and Dad are on holiday,
so we have to stay in place

39:53.185 --> 39:54.478
until they come back.

39:54.478 --> 39:56.146
That's the rule.

40:02.069 --> 40:03.195
Nice yard.

40:04.154 --> 40:05.614
You have to get out of here.

40:06.114 --> 40:08.242
- They've evacuated Central London.
- I know that.

40:08.242 --> 40:09.535
How you lot even getting food?

40:09.535 --> 40:11.703
Monty found candied cherries
in the wine cellar.

40:11.703 --> 40:14.373
He says they're too syrupy,
so I get most of them.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.376
Is that all you've got to eat?

40:18.961 --> 40:20.003
One second.

40:20.003 --> 40:22.256
Hey, what are you doing?
That's our travel food!

40:23.423 --> 40:24.466
Bloody help yourself.

40:24.466 --> 40:27.344
Like you were going to help yourself
to my dad's Porsche?

40:27.344 --> 40:29.346
So, yeah, we will, thanks.

40:29.346 --> 40:32.349
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- So that makes it all right then?

40:32.349 --> 40:33.475
To save the world?

40:33.475 --> 40:35.686
Yeah. I think that's a pretty good reason.

40:35.686 --> 40:38.480
I can trade you for the crisps.
I have maps.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.524
Look! This one's of Antarctica.

40:41.024 --> 40:42.734
- I also have a first aid kit.
- Pen,

40:42.734 --> 40:45.487
they don't want your stupid maps
or first aid kit, okay?

40:45.487 --> 40:46.905
You don't know that.

40:46.905 --> 40:47.990
Sorry about my brother.

40:47.990 --> 40:49.867
Mum said he never outgrew
his terrible twos.

40:49.867 --> 40:50.993
Mug off.

40:50.993 --> 40:53.537
There's a tent city down in Southwark,
and they're running buses

40:53.537 --> 40:55.455
to the countryside where kids can be safe.

40:56.623 --> 40:58.292
Your parents will know
to look for you there.

40:58.292 --> 41:00.711
We stay in place.
That's how we don't get lost.

41:00.711 --> 41:03.213
- I promise you. You won't get lost.
- No.

41:03.881 --> 41:05.215
Just leave it, all right?

41:06.592 --> 41:08.093
Can any of you lot even drive?

41:12.222 --> 41:14.474
What were you planning to do
with a jacked car then?

41:15.184 --> 41:17.102
Have you ever watched <i>Fast & Furious</i>?

41:17.102 --> 41:19.229
- The fuck--
- Have you even played <i>GTA</i>?

41:19.229 --> 41:23.358
It's not that hard.
Millions of idiots drive every single day.

41:23.358 --> 41:26.278
- We will be fine.
- That's ridiculous. Your plan is shite.

41:26.987 --> 41:28.655
So you haven't changed one bit, have you?

41:28.655 --> 41:30.532
- You're a fucking idiot!
- Yeah? Say that again!

41:30.532 --> 41:32.284
- Or what?
- Fuck that! Say that again!

41:32.284 --> 41:33.911
Or what? What are you gonna do?

41:33.911 --> 41:35.579
- Fuck that! Say it again!
- Stop it!

41:36.288 --> 41:37.331
Fuck.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.460
Flyovers.

41:42.336 --> 41:43.629
They're searching for aliens.

41:45.047 --> 41:47.090
Go away, go away, go away, go away.

41:47.090 --> 41:50.969
Mum, Dad, Mum, Dad.
Go away, go away, go away, go away.

41:50.969 --> 41:52.763
Mum, Dad.

41:52.763 --> 41:54.681
Go away, go away, go away, go away.

41:54.681 --> 41:55.933
- No, no, no.
- Mum, Dad.

41:55.933 --> 41:57.476
- Hey, Penny, Penny. You're okay.
- Mum, Dad.

41:57.476 --> 41:59.019
- Penny, you're okay. It's me.
- Go away.

41:59.019 --> 42:00.103
Okay?

42:00.103 --> 42:01.813
Listen, listen, Pen. Okay?

42:01.813 --> 42:04.483
Hey, where are we?
In the maze around Danbury's.

42:04.483 --> 42:07.402
Where do we go in the maze?
We go forward and turn right.

42:07.402 --> 42:09.780
- And then where do we go?
- Left.

42:09.780 --> 42:13.200
Nice. We're there. We're there.
We did it. Okay?

42:18.121 --> 42:20.666
Look, you can stay the night, take a car.

42:20.666 --> 42:22.209
I don't care. Just fuck off!

42:29.550 --> 42:31.218
Trevante Cole reporting for duty.

42:32.302 --> 42:33.512
Just shipped in.

42:35.264 --> 42:37.432
We weren't expecting any new troops today.

42:37.432 --> 42:39.685
- Where'd you come from?
- Camp Blanding.

42:39.685 --> 42:40.978
Did two tours. Afghanistan.

42:40.978 --> 42:42.771
Came home, sent me here, didn't say why.

42:42.771 --> 42:46.233
Would've been here last week
but the transport got hit on the road.

42:47.484 --> 42:49.444
Rest of the troops didn't make it back.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.446
I'm sorry.

42:52.239 --> 42:53.657
It's been a long haul.

42:55.826 --> 42:58.871
Yeah, I could use some sleep,
a bunk down, and whatever grub you got.

42:58.871 --> 43:01.456
Finished my MREs two states back.

43:01.456 --> 43:03.375
Private Palomino at C9.

43:03.375 --> 43:07.045
I've got a Chief Trevante Cole
from Camp Blanding reporting for TD.

43:07.963 --> 43:10.090
What's the deal here, man, at this base?

43:10.090 --> 43:11.675
<i>Second floor.</i>

43:13.051 --> 43:14.678
You'll get briefed by the sarge.

43:16.388 --> 43:17.389
Thanks.

43:36.158 --> 43:37.576
Is she okay?

43:38.619 --> 43:41.163
Yeah. She just gets like that sometimes.

43:53.884 --> 43:56.470
My mum says it's when she feels
out of control.

43:57.304 --> 44:01.099
I know it gets too much in her head.
The rest of the time she's all right.

44:01.099 --> 44:04.853
I mean, a complete pain in my arse,
but all right.

44:08.982 --> 44:10.442
Can't blame her, really.

44:11.193 --> 44:13.820
I think
we're all sort of screaming inside.

44:15.781 --> 44:17.574
She's just doing it on the outside.

44:22.287 --> 44:24.039
Why would you go to bloody Paris?

44:25.123 --> 44:27.960
Look, they don't want us there.
As if they ever did.

44:28.752 --> 44:30.087
And what if you're wrong?

44:30.796 --> 44:32.422
What if he's not even out there?

44:33.131 --> 44:36.635
What if you do somehow get across
to the other side of the Channel...

44:38.512 --> 44:39.847
You know?

44:40.806 --> 44:42.057
He's not there.

44:45.352 --> 44:46.937
You know how people always say,

44:46.937 --> 44:50.190
"If you can see the goal in your head,
you can stick it."

44:52.359 --> 44:53.944
I never really got that before.

44:58.490 --> 44:59.825
I see him in my head.

45:00.742 --> 45:01.743
Caspar.

45:02.578 --> 45:04.246
I can feel him.

45:05.163 --> 45:07.291
I don't know how else to describe it.

45:07.291 --> 45:08.375
I just...

45:09.376 --> 45:10.794
I know he's out there.

45:11.753 --> 45:13.755
And I'm going to find him,

45:13.755 --> 45:16.550
and then he's going to help us
stop these bastards.

45:19.678 --> 45:20.804
I know it sounds mental.

45:20.804 --> 45:23.223
No, it sounds...

45:25.434 --> 45:27.102
Well, yeah, it does sound mental,

45:28.729 --> 45:30.772
but the whole world's mental, right?

45:45.537 --> 45:47.164
Going to the head.

47:19.548 --> 47:21.884
- Hey, hey! Wait!
- Hands up! Put your hands up!

47:22.843 --> 47:23.844
Relax, guys.

47:23.844 --> 47:26.346
Listen. Let me explain.
I just got lost, okay?

47:26.346 --> 47:28.390
- I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

47:29.224 --> 47:31.768
Camp Blanding closed four weeks ago.

47:33.812 --> 47:36.607
Monty! Monty!

47:37.733 --> 47:38.775
Monty, wake up.

47:40.903 --> 47:41.945
What?

47:41.945 --> 47:44.448
We have to go with them. We have to help.

47:45.407 --> 47:47.784
If we save the world,
then Mum and Dad can come home.

47:47.784 --> 47:49.912
We can't, Pen. Okay?

47:49.912 --> 47:53.665
- Look! I have a map of Paris.
- Actually, Monty's right, Penny.

47:53.665 --> 47:55.209
It's too dangerous.

47:55.209 --> 47:57.169
Yeah. And you're not actually invited.

47:57.169 --> 47:59.713
- Oh, shut up, Alf.
- What? They're not.

47:59.713 --> 48:02.758
You need us. Monty can drive.

48:02.758 --> 48:04.092
Sort of.

48:04.092 --> 48:05.427
Tell them, Monty.

48:06.762 --> 48:10.599
If Mum and Dad can't come back to us,
then we have to save them.

48:10.599 --> 48:12.559
Stop being a wanker.

48:13.143 --> 48:15.604
Tell them they need us, please.

48:16.855 --> 48:18.106
Please.

48:19.942 --> 48:23.070
Oh, fucking hell. My God. Geez.

48:23.862 --> 48:28.408
Right, okay. Look, right,
our dad's got a flat in Paris, okay?

48:29.785 --> 48:33.288
We can go there and then you can look
for Caspar. All right?

48:34.790 --> 48:35.791
All right.

48:36.375 --> 48:37.543
Yes.

48:37.543 --> 48:39.169
All right, we'll take the Jag.

48:47.970 --> 48:51.598
Sheriff, he got past the fence line
and onto the base.

48:53.767 --> 48:54.768
We'll take care of him.

48:55.435 --> 48:56.436
This way.

49:02.442 --> 49:03.443
Hands.

49:16.748 --> 49:18.584
Hey! What are you doing with my bag?

49:18.584 --> 49:20.878
- Those are my things.
- Don't worry.

49:20.878 --> 49:23.297
You'll be getting it back in the morning
when the transport comes to take you...

49:23.297 --> 49:24.673
- No.
- ...out of state.

49:24.673 --> 49:28.135
What are you talking about? Listen,
can-- can you just give me my notebook?

49:28.135 --> 49:31.180
Like I said, you will get everything back.

49:31.180 --> 49:32.264
It's just one night.

49:33.056 --> 49:36.059
You got any urgent needs,
medical, whatnot, just got to holler.

49:36.059 --> 49:37.853
Not too noisy now.

49:37.853 --> 49:40.355
This don't need to be
anything but hospitable.

49:44.860 --> 49:47.863
And welcome to Idabel.
Hope you enjoy your stay.

50:16.808 --> 50:18.852
It's a shit model.

50:18.852 --> 50:20.729
Or maybe you're a shit driver.

50:21.313 --> 50:23.524
I told you
we should've taken the Aston Martin.

50:23.524 --> 50:25.901
Yeah? You'd be on my lap, mate.
Or Penny in the boot.

50:26.568 --> 50:27.653
We're doomed.
