-[bat hitting ball]

00:24.941 --> 00:26.151
[spectators cheering]

00:26.234 --> 00:28.737
[announcer] And a pleasant good afternoon
to everybody, folks.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.155
What a ball game!

00:30.238 --> 00:32.698
It's the Triple-A championship matchup

00:32.782 --> 00:34.492
we've all been waiting for

00:34.784 --> 00:37.996
between the vaunted
Rochester Honey Badgers

00:38.079 --> 00:41.541
and the hometown
Southfield Platypuses.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.793
Gosh, I-- That never sounds right.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.295
Plat-- platypi?

00:45.545 --> 00:47.297
Platy-- platypussies.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.048
Ooh, can I say that?

00:49.132 --> 00:54.137
All eyes are on Ben McGrath,
the hottest prospect in decades,

00:54.387 --> 00:56.931
coming to bat in what surely
will be his final game

00:57.015 --> 00:58.475
in the minors.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.852
With the top major-league
scouts in attendance,

01:01.061 --> 01:04.272
this once-in-a-lifetime talent
is a shoo-in to get called up

01:04.355 --> 01:05.397
to the big show.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.984
[whoops] Go get 'em, baby!

01:08.485 --> 01:11.321
His lovely wife is here
and they are expecting a baby.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.031
What a lucky guy.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.283
[crowd cheering]

01:16.785 --> 01:18.745
Look at that stance.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.914
We're talking
lightning in a bottle, folks.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.751
A five-tool stud that every
team would sell its soul for.

01:24.918 --> 01:28.338
An athlete
of Greek-godian proportions.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.381
A legend in the making!

01:30.965 --> 01:34.552
And here comes the pitch to this
can't miss future superstar.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.556
[whooshing]

01:38.932 --> 01:41.184
[sound fades]

01:43.770 --> 01:45.063
Ohh!

01:45.897 --> 01:47.482
[groans]

01:47.565 --> 01:50.527
[slowed down] Oh, fuck!

01:50.610 --> 01:51.820
[thuds]

01:51.986 --> 01:54.197
[crowd gasps]

01:54.697 --> 01:55.865
No.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.200
Oh, that's gonna hurt.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.119
[groans]

02:23.434 --> 02:24.310
[man] Idiot!

02:24.394 --> 02:26.855
I told you, I want the stripes
going this way!

02:28.398 --> 02:29.691
Do it over!

02:39.075 --> 02:40.243
[knocking]

02:42.537 --> 02:45.081
-You're late.
-I know, I'm sorry, Dana.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.875
I had to re-stripe a lawn.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.459
As long as it was something important.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.503
Jack! Your father's here!

02:55.258 --> 02:57.343
Hey, uh... I passed the bar.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.804
Not something I heard very
often when we were married.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.056
I don't mean a place-
that-sells-liquor bar.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.766
I mean the bar exam.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.643
To become a lawyer. I passed.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.521
So all those nights studying paid off?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.273
Congratulations, Ben.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.858
Well, thanks, Dana.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.193
I guess that makes you the most
educated gardener in town.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.281
Heya, buddy.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.908
You ready for dinner with your dad?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.493
I'm gonna miss you, Mom.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.121
Aww.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.123
Really, really miss you.

03:27.415 --> 03:28.291
I know.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.709
[sighs]

03:33.504 --> 03:37.759
Hello, there. We would like two
of your finest Sloppy meal deals

03:37.967 --> 03:43.014
and make the fries celebration
size because we are celebrating.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.350
I just became a uh...

03:46.434 --> 03:47.560
lawyer.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.942
Oh, Jack.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.277
Buddy, I thought we talked about this.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.780
You don't have to wear
a cup all the time.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.491
And I've told you it's for protection.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.117
From life hitting me in the nuts.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.619
[exhales]

04:04.702 --> 04:07.956
Look, what happened to me,
it was just bad luck.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.917
Sure, I spent months in rehab

04:11.000 --> 04:13.670
and, no, I never played baseball again

04:13.753 --> 04:17.589
and, yeah, I had
some tough years after that.

04:17.714 --> 04:19.968
But I'm on the right track now.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.512
You know, I got
some big interviews lined up.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.472
Mom says there's no such thing
as bad luck.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.015
She says we make our own luck

04:26.099 --> 04:27.767
and what happened to you
wasn't luck.

04:28.017 --> 04:28.935
It was destiny.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.270
Me getting hit in the nuts?

04:30.436 --> 04:31.479
You failing.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.523
Your mom said I was destined to fail?

04:33.648 --> 04:35.358
She said baseball
is a game of failure

04:35.441 --> 04:37.819
with even the best hitters
making outs most of the time.

04:38.278 --> 04:42.198
Technically, that's true but
it gives a false impression.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.825
So you didn't fail?

04:49.914 --> 04:51.749
Oh, and hey,
can we please get some...

04:52.083 --> 04:54.335
-[horn honks]
-napkins?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.379
[Stallings] Mmm-hmm.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.922
Mmm-hmm.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.049
[Stallings] Mmm-hmm.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.011
So, you have a typo here.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.971
"UCLO" instead of UCLA.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.598
Actually, uh, UCLO is correct.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.976
I went to the University
of Calexico Law online.

05:10.935 --> 05:11.894
Mmm-hmm.

05:11.978 --> 05:16.149
Well, Mr. McGrath, I can't tell
you what a genuine pleasure

05:16.232 --> 05:17.734
it's been meeting you.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.403
You seem like a fine,
upstanding young lad

05:20.486 --> 05:23.614
and we'll be sure to get back
to you ASAP with our decision.

05:26.576 --> 05:30.538
So my focus was litigation,
uh, primarily civil.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.664
You look familiar.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.042
Were you on some sort
of reality TV show?

05:34.208 --> 05:35.668
[exhales] Uh, no.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.836
Dated a Kardashian?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.213
-No.
-I got it.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.132
You're the breakin' balls guy!

05:41.758 --> 05:43.760
You got nailed in the nuts
and never played again!

05:44.427 --> 05:46.387
[groaning]

05:46.471 --> 05:49.849
[Strogonoff] That is a hacky sack
exploding against a semi!

05:50.099 --> 05:51.642
An erupting piñata!

05:51.726 --> 05:53.811
Frida, get in here!
You gotta see this!

05:53.895 --> 05:55.563
It's like a ten-car pile-up
on the freeway.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.608
I wanna vomit in my mouth
but I can't take my eyes off this!

06:00.109 --> 06:02.320
This! This is art!

06:03.780 --> 06:04.822
[sleeve rips]

06:08.618 --> 06:10.787
I'll let myself out.
[clears throat]

06:11.621 --> 06:13.164
[weatherman on TV]
...14 miles per hour.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.958
It's currently 75 degrees.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.627
[commercial man on TV]
Have you been screwed?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.045
Are you being screwed right now?

06:19.295 --> 06:22.381
Exes, landlords, creditors,
insurance companies.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.258
If you're getting drilled,
we can help.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.260
We're the law firm
of Schmood and Associates

06:26.469 --> 06:28.471
and we look out for the little guy.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.099
Don't get screwed, get Schmood.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.185
I'd rather keep gardening.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.438
[phone rings]

06:39.315 --> 06:41.734
-[phone continues ringing]
-[irritated sigh]

06:43.277 --> 06:44.487
Hello?

06:44.946 --> 06:45.988
Yeah.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.659
Tomorrow morning? Yes.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.452
Yeah.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.871
Great, thank you, very much.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.541
[laughs]

06:56.707 --> 06:58.459
Yeah, Ben!

07:08.636 --> 07:09.762
Mr. McGrath.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.432
I'm not late, am I?
I thought I was early.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.059
Being early is being late
at Stenhouse and Gray.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.269
Remember that.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.647
I'm Iris Fletcher, an associate
working under Mr. Stenhouse.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.108
We're very excited that you're here.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.865
Whoa!

07:30.408 --> 07:34.078
[clock ticking]

07:34.662 --> 07:38.583
Working days,
law school at night,

07:39.333 --> 07:41.502
and still first in your class.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.006
That is very impressive, young man.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.966
Thank you, sir.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.678
Though UCLO isn't exactly Harvard.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.723
Screw Harvard.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.393
Screw Yale,
screw all those prick factories.

07:58.269 --> 08:02.398
What we're looking for
at Stenhouse and Gray,

08:02.690 --> 08:04.275
you can't teach at a school.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.781
I'm talking about winners, Ben.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.034
Winners.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.829
Men who have faced adversity
and kicked its ass

08:17.121 --> 08:19.540
until it bleeds from every orifice.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.337
So I just have one
simple question for you, Ben.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.841
Are you a winner?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.469
Vertical! Vertical!

08:31.677 --> 08:33.011
How stupid can you be?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.679
Almost done!

08:34.764 --> 08:37.683
I'll code-red your pansy ass
if you don't fall in line!

08:42.688 --> 08:43.773
[seething]

08:47.318 --> 08:49.153
What do you want, Ben?
Jack's still at school.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.656
Is that a new suit?

08:51.739 --> 08:54.992
You mean this mothball-free silk
and virgin wool blend?

08:55.618 --> 08:59.038
Yes, it is. And I know Jack's
been talking about math camp

08:59.121 --> 09:02.124
over the summer so, um,
I thought I'd drop off a check.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.379
[laughs] Okay. How much weed whacking
did you have to do to get this?

09:06.587 --> 09:08.256
I got hired as a lawyer.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.840
Stenhouse and Gray.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.468
I start this afternoon, field assignment.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.928
Stenhouse and Gray?

09:14.011 --> 09:15.638
That is the top firm in the city.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.683
Well, it just got a little bit firmer.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.229
Field assignment. Field assignment.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.362
Field assignment.

09:31.654 --> 09:35.116
Hey Johnson,
it's not a hamster. Throw it!

09:35.700 --> 09:36.826
Jeez.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.953
Ben, hey!

09:39.787 --> 09:41.622
Thanks so much for meeting me here.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.293
Did I mention in our interview that I was
the firm's softball manager?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.628
-You did not.
-Well, I am.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.464
And I take great pride in the fact
that I've put together

09:50.590 --> 09:52.883
the most talented roster in the city.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.053
We've won the prestigious
Lawyer League Championship

09:56.178 --> 09:57.513
Twelve years and counting.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.224
Wait a minute, you--

10:00.641 --> 10:02.852
you wouldn't happen to play, would you?

10:03.728 --> 10:04.979
Ah!

10:07.607 --> 10:09.066
Boom. McGrath.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.735
That's you.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.406
Ben, we both know I didn't hire you

10:15.489 --> 10:17.658
for your brilliant legal mind.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.910
Come on, to build
a championship-caliber team,

10:20.077 --> 10:21.871
everyone has to have a role.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.291
And at Stenhouse and Gray,
this is your role.

10:25.875 --> 10:26.959
Ringer.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.378
[laughs] Now, why don't you
just step up to the plate

10:29.462 --> 10:31.088
and let's see what you can do, big fella.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.131
Come on.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.925
Now, Mr. Stenhouse, I'm really sorry.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.177
I don't play anymore.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.137
You see, there was an incident.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.139
Yeah, yeah, I know
all about your incident.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.767
I also know that you batted
360 in Triple-A.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.519
Only a total loser would let
an errant ball to the nards

10:45.686 --> 10:47.063
erase all that skill.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.899
Batter up!

10:50.399 --> 10:52.276
Come on. There you go.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.659
Center-field fence, 480.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.868
Go for it.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.462
[heartbeat]

11:13.130 --> 11:14.924

-[crowd laughs]

11:15.716 --> 11:19.720
[laughing]

11:21.597 --> 11:23.599
[baby laughs]

11:24.308 --> 11:26.268
[pager over PA] Every surgeon report
to the OR, stat!

11:26.560 --> 11:28.354
That is one shattered nut!

11:28.771 --> 11:30.189
[screams]

11:31.690 --> 11:36.612
Whoa. What in the name
of holy hell is happening?

11:36.821 --> 11:38.280
I'm sorry.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.659
At Stenhouse and Gray, we're not
interested in "sorry."

11:41.742 --> 11:43.077
We're interested in winning!

11:43.244 --> 11:44.161
You're fired!

11:47.665 --> 11:48.999
Scotch, neat.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.097
To being nut-punched by life.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.307
Again.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.103
[pours]

12:10.104 --> 12:11.439
[Mel] Hey, pal.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.944
You don't seem to understand
how this drinking thing works.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.989
No, I know how it works, believe me.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.533
I'm just here to wallow.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.286
I worked my ass off
to become a lawyer,

12:25.661 --> 12:27.913
only to get fired on my first day.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.082
Who would fire somebody
on their first day?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.917
Gordon Stenhouse.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.670
Stenhouse! That arrogant, sleazy bully!

12:34.837 --> 12:36.422
He gives lawyers a bad name!

12:36.630 --> 12:37.756
Ooh, hang on.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.551
Excuse me, sir?

12:40.718 --> 12:41.927
Please, take my card.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.889
If you ever need help with a DUI
or vehicular manslaughter.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.516
Or estate planning for your widow.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.395
You're a lawyer, too?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.105
What? No.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.732
I own a law firm.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.859
Speaking of which, you're hired.

12:57.985 --> 12:58.861
Without an interview?

12:58.944 --> 13:00.112
We just had one.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.114
You're a lawyer
currently not drinking,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.241
you hate Stenhouse,
and you own a suit.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.868
You're perfect.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.703
Come by the office tomorrow morning.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.624
[tires screech then crash]

13:11.916 --> 13:12.875
[Mel] Coming!

13:13.876 --> 13:15.085
[sighs]

13:20.299 --> 13:22.510
I guess that makes me an ass.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.479
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Okay, okay.

13:34.063 --> 13:34.939
[clears throat]

13:36.065 --> 13:37.816
Mr. Schmood. Hello.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.486
And a hardy how-do to you, too.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.906
Um, I was told to meet here
by a man in a bar?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.533
Was it the Bottom's Up?

13:46.075 --> 13:49.370
I mean, I hear
they have a nice ambience.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.247
He said you have an opening
I might fill.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.373
Oh, my.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.125
-Mr. Schmood, I um--
-He's not Schmood,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.503
he's the actor that plays him
in the commercial.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.421
Easy on the creepy, Howard.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.674
-Mr. Schmood, I--
-I'm not Schmood, either.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.217
I'm Mel Carmichael.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.928
Schmood was my lawyer
until I caught him embezzling.

14:06.303 --> 14:09.473
He got four years and I got this
crap company in the settlement!

14:09.723 --> 14:12.601
But I kept the name
because I like the slogan.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.937
[deep voice]
Don't get screwed, get Schmood.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.314
-[Mel] That's the one.
-[laughing]

14:18.774 --> 14:20.067
Now, save it for the commercial!

14:20.484 --> 14:22.278
So, you actually want the job.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.154
Stupendous, follow me.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.578
[phones ring]

14:30.661 --> 14:32.705
Well, what do you think?

14:35.416 --> 14:38.586
You wouldn't believe the deal
I got on this abandoned school.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.254
Saves me a ton of overhead.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.923
Plus, it has everything
a lawyer could need.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.718
Now, we recently had a lawyer
named Jeff who left us

14:45.843 --> 14:49.013
so I'm gonna give you his office
and his caseload.

14:50.139 --> 14:50.973
Ta-da!

14:51.432 --> 14:53.934
You can thank me later.
Good luck, son.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.495
Whoa!

15:15.205 --> 15:16.498
[Mel] McGrath!

15:17.416 --> 15:20.419
When you're done settling in,
I need to see you in my office!

15:23.464 --> 15:25.049
[yells]

15:25.215 --> 15:27.009
I know, I know.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.677
[chuckles]

15:28.761 --> 15:32.222
I went crazy on the tchotchkes
after I made my first billion.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.559
You've already met
my North American pine martin.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.229
This is the robe that Elvis
actually died in.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.608
This is a paper weight
with Gandhi's actual toenail.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.320
And this are the remains
of an annoying robot butler.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.656
[Number 7]
Who's calling who annoying?

15:48.739 --> 15:52.910
He made the moves on my ex-wife
so I keep him in this bucket.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.330
-She came on to me first.
-Shut up!

15:56.747 --> 15:58.207
Now, what can I do for you?

15:58.624 --> 16:01.210
Uh, you called me.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.336
Oh, that's right.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.214
I need an opinion on Reedy's Hole.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.299
-Who's hole?
-[Annie] It's a place.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.928
The town we're in right now.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.973
Ben McGrath, Annie Holm.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.978
She's a Berkeley law grad
clerking here for the summer.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.397
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.859
Enough of the ogling!
This is no place for chemistry.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.239
Show him the letter.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.492
The city sent us this.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.745
It's a notice of
a zoning commission hearing

16:36.829 --> 16:38.330
to consider a proposal for building

16:38.414 --> 16:40.874
a new sewage treatment plant
in this area.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.002
Building that plant will mean
the end of Reedy's Hole.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.171
They'll compensate everybody
at fair market value.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.756
While ruining a community.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.426
Well, as long as they follow
proper procedure

16:50.718 --> 16:52.011
there's nothing we can do.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.053
[sighs]

16:53.679 --> 16:54.805
That's what Jeff said.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.647
Uh, anything else, Mr. Carmichael?

17:05.065 --> 17:07.151
Call me Mel and that'll be it
till 5:00.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.777
What happens at 5:00?

17:08.944 --> 17:09.903
Softball.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.946
Oh, here we go again.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.407
Let me guess, you looked me up
on the internet too?

17:14.657 --> 17:16.285
Well, you listen and you listen good.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.703
I don't play anymore!

17:17.828 --> 17:19.371
I don't have time for the internet,

17:19.579 --> 17:21.123
and all I said was softball!

17:21.665 --> 17:23.876
It's a game, not a colonoscopy.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.170
But if you don't wanna play,
that's fine.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.503
You'll manage.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.090
Well, I'm sure I will,
I've made it this far.

17:30.340 --> 17:34.011
No, no, no.
I mean you'll manage.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.269
Well, well, if it isn't Mr. Stenhouse--
Why are you wearing jeans?

17:42.436 --> 17:43.604
Did you get fired already?

17:43.854 --> 17:46.482
[sighs]
I left for another opportunity.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.025
The kind where I should hold off

17:48.108 --> 17:49.735
depositing your math-camp check?

17:49.818 --> 17:51.487
Can you just go get Jack, please?

17:52.029 --> 17:53.447
Fine.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.783
-[screams] Jack!
-[sighs]

17:57.076 --> 17:58.577
[Jack] So, back to gardening?

18:00.454 --> 18:04.458
I'm dressed like this 'cause I have
to manage my new firm's softball team.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.585
I was hoping you'd help.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.712
You know I don't know anything
about that dangerous sport.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.714
Sadly, yes.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.425
But you do know math and I need
someone to help with stats.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.969
Batting averages, hits,
that sort of thing.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.264
And the job comes with this.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.976
The T55 titanium graphing calculator?

18:23.602 --> 18:24.770
Are you bribing me?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.355
Yes, I am.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.107
So you in?

18:30.734 --> 18:32.945
[grunting]

18:37.825 --> 18:39.118
Hi, everybody.

18:39.284 --> 18:43.664
I'm Ben McGrath,
your new manager, apparently.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.916
I'm Smegman. Third base.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.793
Let's hope things work out
better for you

18:47.876 --> 18:49.962
than they did our last manager, Jeff.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.463
What happened to Jeff?

18:51.588 --> 18:52.798
He hung himself.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.970
Uh... Jeff was a deeply-in-debt manic
depressive gambling addict.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.514
I'm sure the team had nothing
to do with his suicide.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.932
It didn't help.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.601
Neither did his wife,
who was rumored to be sporking

19:04.685 --> 19:06.478
some rich lawyer behind his back.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.398
All women eventually spork a rich lawyer

19:09.481 --> 19:10.691
behind their man's back.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.776
Isn't that right, Monica?

19:12.943 --> 19:15.529
Smegman's wife sporked
a rich lawyer behind his back.

19:15.612 --> 19:16.572
Ah.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.866
I'm Kashmir. First base and Sikh.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.534
What's wrong with you?

19:20.659 --> 19:21.910
No, not "sick".

19:22.244 --> 19:23.162
Sikh.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.290
As in the religion that teaches
the five virtues of truth,

19:26.373 --> 19:28.917
compassion, contentment,
humility, and love.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.044
In case you're the type of American

19:31.128 --> 19:32.838
that likes to randomly
punch foreigners in the face.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.132
I'm Milford, center field.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.301
They call me "The Milf."

19:37.467 --> 19:39.761
No, they don't.
No one calls you that.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.930
That is Dobkins, our catcher,

19:42.097 --> 19:43.682
and Schmood's chief investigator.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.142
Hey.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.104
I know who killed Tupac.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.276
The ear piece connects to no one.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.404
And that's Howard, our pitcher.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.864
We've met.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.074
And I'm also into catching.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.037
I mean, uh,
whatever the team needs.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.457
Speaking of the team,
where's everybody else?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.042
This is it. Five.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.585
One for every base.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.213
Uh, six, when we count you.

20:14.671 --> 20:15.756
Oh, no.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.800
I'm... just here to manage.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.012
I can't hit.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.056
Sweet. Neither can we.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.226
[horn honking]

20:29.436 --> 20:31.021
Hey, Mel,
I didn't know you were--

20:31.104 --> 20:31.980
Fertile?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.357
Gonna be here.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.442
Well, sure, I wouldn't miss
the first game of the season.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.027
Wait, I thought this was just a practice.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.111
It's both.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.322
Meet my latest offspring, Melanie.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.783
AKA Mel Junior.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.952
I was never supposed to be born.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.370
[Mel chuckles]

20:47.704 --> 20:50.332
Mel Junior was a key piece
of evidence in a law suit

20:50.415 --> 20:51.708
over my botched vasectomy.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.336
I got $1.2 million
and a fantastic kid.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.712
-Dad.
-Oh.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.256
Oh.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.676
Okay. Well, Melanie,
it's really nice to meet you,

21:00.801 --> 21:02.970
and this is my son, Jack.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.556
Can you mutilate a radioactive zombie
with a rusty machete on that thing?

21:06.723 --> 21:08.642
-Um, no.
-Didn't think so.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.519
Let's go play Gore Wars.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.439
Uh, Mel, listen.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.776
We can't play a game today,
we only have five players.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.403
I love a good underdog story.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.904
[horn honking]

21:21.697 --> 21:22.531
McGrath.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.074
You're with Schmood now?

21:24.533 --> 21:26.952
There's a one-way ticket to Loserville.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.329
[laughs]

21:37.671 --> 21:38.588
Yeah!

21:51.560 --> 21:53.478
Get outta here.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.773
This isn't cricket! [laughs]

21:58.608 --> 22:00.193
Whoo!

22:10.704 --> 22:12.080
Are those bullets?

22:12.914 --> 22:14.499
I've seen some things.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.709
[screams]

22:17.377 --> 22:19.087
All right, right here, come on!

22:19.546 --> 22:21.006
[yells]

22:23.508 --> 22:25.135
See what you've done to me, Monica?

22:25.302 --> 22:28.513
Did you know, that in space,
no one can hear you fart?

22:28.597 --> 22:31.725
Or smell your fart? Or even fart
themselves, because the vacuum in space

22:31.808 --> 22:34.394
would cause them to implode
before they can let one rip.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.237
Unless they're in a space suit,
in which case they would be

22:44.321 --> 22:46.490
the only one smelling it,
in what could euphemistically

22:46.573 --> 22:49.659
be called
the ultimate Dutch oven.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.661
And what's that weird lump
in your pants?

23:01.296 --> 23:03.590
[cheering]

23:05.467 --> 23:06.384
Yeah!

23:07.552 --> 23:09.638
Suck on that! [laughs]

23:15.393 --> 23:16.645
Attaboy.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.273
Hey, Stenhouse, you're up by ten.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.442
Doesn't this league have a mercy rule?

23:22.692 --> 23:24.319
Well, only if both sides agree.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.321
I'll check with my side.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.239
Guys? No?

23:27.322 --> 23:28.365
Okay.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.283
Sorry. My guys say no.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.827
They need the batting practice.

23:33.078 --> 23:33.954
Boop.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.040
[Jack] That was painful.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.416
Yep.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.045
Although weirdly, Mel said
that was the best they played in years.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.256
I meant sitting next to Melanie.

23:44.339 --> 23:47.425
She spent two full innings talking about
serial killers and their pets.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.555
Dad, why does the Schmood team
even try

23:51.638 --> 23:53.098
when they only have five players?

23:54.015 --> 23:55.600
They never had a chance.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.894
I don't know, buddy.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.273
Maybe it's to keep the winners
of the world honest.

24:01.690 --> 24:05.277
Force them to actually go through
the trouble of beating ya.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.665
Hey.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.542
I thought you said
there was nothing we could do.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.711
Well, where's the fun in that?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.838
Well, looky-dooky here.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.299
-Oh!
-Whoo!

24:27.382 --> 24:28.884
[chuckles]

24:29.217 --> 24:30.177
Seriously?

24:30.260 --> 24:35.140
It looks like I get the pleasure of
annihilating you twice in the same week.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.267
Boo-yah.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.311
This guy's everywhere.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.651
All right. What've we got here?

24:46.985 --> 24:49.529
Gordon Stenhouse
on behalf of the city

24:49.613 --> 24:52.991
for the Reedy's Hole
sewage-plant proposal.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.492
Gordo.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.245
[laughs] I haven't seen you
at the club in a while.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.916
Yeah. I guess we'll have to get
a foursome together soon, Ger.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.500
As long as it's not a threesome.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.629
[laughter]

25:05.712 --> 25:07.756
Oh, my God, please.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.509
And you are?

25:11.676 --> 25:14.262
Uh, Ben McGrath,
Schmood and Associates.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.306
We're here to oppose
the facility.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.891
Obviously.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.684
But on what grounds?

25:20.894 --> 25:22.896
Well, it'll destroy Reedy's Hole.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.774
A sewage plant in that neighborhood
would be an upgrade.

25:25.857 --> 25:29.778
Plus, that's not a legal basis
for an objection, Mr. Chairman.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.113
He's right, on both counts.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.532
-What else you got?
-Uh...

25:34.783 --> 25:36.785
Sir, the chief engineer, Mr. Capposseri,

25:36.868 --> 25:39.371
failed to sign the report
authorizing the project.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.213
A simple oversight, Mr. Chairman.

25:48.296 --> 25:51.132
Fortunately, the assistant
to chief is here

25:51.216 --> 25:53.093
and can sign on the chief's behalf.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.011
I'll allow it.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.972
[mouths] Thank you.
[speaks] Sir?

25:59.849 --> 26:02.852
[Stenhouse] Okey-dokey,
John Henry right there.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.646
Now, if there's nothing more.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.189
Uh, hold on.

26:06.273 --> 26:12.445
According to rule 14.2, no vote
shall be scheduled any earlier

26:12.529 --> 26:16.074
than ten days after the
submission of a signed report,

26:16.324 --> 26:20.036
said signing taking place
eight seconds ago.

26:20.996 --> 26:25.333
Surely we aren't going to delay
a $100 million civic project

26:25.417 --> 26:27.043
over such nonsense.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.420
Sorry, Gordo.

26:28.586 --> 26:29.796
I'm afraid we are.

26:33.216 --> 26:36.094
You know, you are only delaying
the inevitable, McGrath,

26:36.469 --> 26:37.679
because you're gonna lose,

26:37.762 --> 26:39.306
and you know how I know
you're gonna lose?

26:39.472 --> 26:41.891
Because you're a loser
and that's what losers do.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.476
They lose.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.820
So, what do we do now?

26:53.987 --> 26:55.572
I have no idea.

26:55.697 --> 26:59.743
But uh, whatever it is,
we got ten days to do it.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.754
Wow, you actually grew up here, huh?

27:11.046 --> 27:13.548
Yep, downtown Reedy's Hole.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.718
This is where they wanna put the plant.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.095
Right in the heart of our community.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.805
But it makes no sense.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.390
We're below the water table,

27:22.474 --> 27:23.808
making it vulnerable to flooding.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.269
Girl really knows her sewage.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.981
A girl also really knows when
her town's being railroaded.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.649
Come on, the mayor's waiting.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.949
[New Age music playing]

27:42.494 --> 27:43.411
[Ben] Uh...

27:43.495 --> 27:44.954
[clears throat]

27:45.121 --> 27:46.247
Mr. Mayor?

27:46.539 --> 27:48.625
Thank you, uh, for meeting us.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.377
I'm Mayor White.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.420
And thank you for meeting me at work.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.047
Mayor White.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.883
We are here to discuss
the city's assertion of eminent domain.

27:57.050 --> 27:57.884
Insertion of what?

27:58.051 --> 27:59.302
Assertion.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.180
Their sewage-plant proposal
will literally tear up our town.

28:02.347 --> 28:05.475
To be honest, Annie,
it's not much of a town already.

28:05.642 --> 28:06.810
What?

28:07.394 --> 28:08.603
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

28:08.686 --> 28:09.604
Or seeing.

28:09.771 --> 28:10.814
[Annie] This is our home.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.482
Mayor, we need your support.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.192
I'll think about it.

28:14.943 --> 28:15.860
-Ooh!
-[Mayor White] Turn over!

28:17.195 --> 28:18.279
[Annie sighs]

28:20.323 --> 28:21.825
Well, that was a bust.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.619
Not that I didn't enjoy
watching your mayor lube up

28:24.702 --> 28:26.162
one of her constituents.

28:27.163 --> 28:28.957
[Mel] It better be good,
I'm completely nude.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.918
Yeah, hey Mel, it's Ben.
Listen, I've decided to pursue

28:32.001 --> 28:33.628
the Reedy's Hole case with Annie.

28:33.711 --> 28:35.588
My guess is we're gonna need
an expert witness,

28:35.755 --> 28:37.424
probably cost about five grand.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.092
What are you, my ex-wife?

28:39.175 --> 28:40.885
You'll never get
that kind of money outta me.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.011
[hangs up]

28:42.679 --> 28:44.013
Okay.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.642
Look, the Mayor will come around.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.060
When you've been losing for so long,

28:49.144 --> 28:51.271
it can be hard to know
you can still fight back.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.857
Yeah, kinda like
a five-person softball team.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.776
Hey, speaking of,
what're you doing tonight,

28:56.860 --> 28:58.653
say, between 5:00 and 7:00?

28:58.820 --> 29:00.697
Trying to find a free expert witness.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.366
Looks like we both have
our work cut out for ourselves.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.581
Hello, everyone.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.500
It's been a real honor
taking over for Jeff

29:12.584 --> 29:14.210
as the softball team manager.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.462
Poor Jeff.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.046
I can't believe he hung himself.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.131
Me either.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.299
He owed me 80 bucks.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.760
And I'm carrying his baby.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.928
You're not carrying his baby.

29:24.220 --> 29:27.891
Anyway, we need a few more
players to be competitive.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.393
Literally, any warm bodies will do.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.188
We're gonna have a lot
of fun, and uh,

29:33.521 --> 29:35.648
hopefully win a few games?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.777
Okay, good talk.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.367
[man with Canadian accent]
Oy, captain!

29:50.497 --> 29:55.084
I'm Dougie, mailroom liaison,
and I'm a goalie.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.296
There are no goalies in softball.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.591
I know, but uh, Kashmir
told me there's free beer, eh?

30:04.177 --> 30:05.303
[laughing]

30:06.805 --> 30:08.139
[laughs] Cheers, bud.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.433
[motor approaches]

30:12.560 --> 30:13.561
And you are?

30:13.645 --> 30:14.771
On a medical scooter.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.397
Thanks for the bulletin.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.233
-No, I meant--
-My legs are paralyzed?

30:18.733 --> 30:20.151
Well aware, believe me.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.236
Really? I was just--

30:21.319 --> 30:22.695
Asking if my package still works?

30:22.987 --> 30:26.658
That, good sir,
is none of your business.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.285
Though the answer is an emphatic yes.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.870
Welcome aboard.

30:31.037 --> 30:31.955
Krinsky.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.541
And I'm only here
to avoid rush-hour traffic.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.709
-Yeah.
-[beeping]

30:38.294 --> 30:39.671
Phew!

30:48.221 --> 30:49.681
Hi. I'm Ramona.

30:49.764 --> 30:53.768
I have been dying to come but
I just took on a massive load

30:53.852 --> 30:56.104
and my back has been
up against the wall.

30:57.605 --> 31:01.401
Uh... [clears throat]
What's your favorite position?

31:02.569 --> 31:03.987
Was that some sort of sexual innuendo?

31:04.070 --> 31:06.197
Because I will not tolerate harassment!

31:07.323 --> 31:08.783
I meant in softball.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.618
Oh. [laughs]

31:10.785 --> 31:15.415
Well, I can fill the hole,
I can really handle the squeeze,

31:15.498 --> 31:18.418
and I can gobble up all
the balls pounded in my gap.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.504
I'm extremely flexible.

31:31.514 --> 31:32.932
Who are we playing again?

31:33.057 --> 31:34.517
Lorey &amp; D'Angelo.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.562
An appellate firm
full of ruthless thugs.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.316
They look
more like math teachers.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.152
You haven't seen them whine.

31:47.030 --> 31:47.864
Ball!

31:47.989 --> 31:49.198
What?

31:49.616 --> 31:51.409
-Come on, ump!
-Guys, quiet!

31:51.951 --> 31:53.161
[indistinct arguing]

31:53.703 --> 31:54.746
See?

31:55.747 --> 31:58.249
Hey, look, that guy
is wearing hockey gear.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.629
Strike!

32:10.845 --> 32:13.514
Are you gonna crouch behind me
the entire time?

32:13.681 --> 32:15.558
Because I can feel your gape.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.853
This is literally the one place
I'm supposed to crouch.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.606
Isn't this great?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.107
America's pastime.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.693
Everyone enjoying each other's company.

32:30.239 --> 32:31.616
Get some!

32:33.910 --> 32:34.911
Out!

32:34.994 --> 32:36.621
Of feeling in my lower extremities?

32:36.829 --> 32:38.831
Thanks for the diagnosis!

32:48.508 --> 32:49.676
Come on.

33:00.561 --> 33:03.523
Oh, boy, beer, ball, beer.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.652
[Kashmir] Drop the beer!
[Smegman] Put the beer down!

33:08.820 --> 33:12.031
[team jeering]
[Dougie groaning]

33:14.033 --> 33:15.326
They're hopeless, Dad.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.328
They aren't gonna win
a single game all season.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.706
Hey, we only lost
by eight runs this time.

33:19.789 --> 33:20.790
We're improving.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.709
Maybe some people are destined to fail.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.045
[sighs]

33:27.296 --> 33:30.591
Buddy, losing isn't
the same thing as failing.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.553
If you always lose and still keep trying,

33:34.012 --> 33:36.222
that says something about your character.

33:37.432 --> 33:41.019
Maybe there's nobility in futility.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.187
That sounds like something
losers tell themselves

33:43.271 --> 33:44.439
to feel better.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.743
Hey.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.036
I got your message.

33:58.119 --> 34:01.205
An engineer from this firm
willing to testify on contingency?

34:01.289 --> 34:03.124
-How'd you find him?
-Craigslist.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.167
[elevator dings]

34:05.251 --> 34:06.127
Mr. McGrath?

34:06.210 --> 34:07.045
-Miss Holt?
-Hi.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.129
Hi.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.172
I'm Arthur Wilde.

34:10.630 --> 34:11.466
Oh, hey, hey.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.801
Why don't we just chat here?

34:21.601 --> 34:22.976
[Arthur sighs]

34:25.730 --> 34:29.358
So, you need an expert to review
a county water-treatment report?

34:29.442 --> 34:32.152
We were very impressed
by your qualifications.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.030
An advanced degree in engineering,

34:34.197 --> 34:36.032
a fellowship in environmental design?

34:36.657 --> 34:38.242
Though, after that there's a gap.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.243
[phone rings]

34:39.327 --> 34:40.953
Hang on, this could be important.

34:43.371 --> 34:44.290
Arthur Wilde.

34:45.625 --> 34:46.501
Uh-huh.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.460
Uh-huh.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.339
Lavender double latte
with extra froth

34:51.422 --> 34:53.591
and have them punch
your frequent-buyer card.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.094
Yeah, right away, Mr. Angel.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.141
Yeah, I'm an intern.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.851
Waiting for the job market to improve.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.270
I figured helping you guys
would look good on my résumé.

35:06.646 --> 35:07.563
Hmm.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.898
[sighs]

35:09.148 --> 35:10.650
Iced mocha, anyone?

35:11.818 --> 35:14.362
[Ben] The key is gonna be cross-examining
the chief engineer.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.781
Right. Remember how nervous
his assistant got?

35:16.864 --> 35:18.491
That was just signing
his own name.

35:18.574 --> 35:19.742
[clanging]

35:20.993 --> 35:22.328
What was that?

35:23.371 --> 35:24.497
Uh...

35:29.210 --> 35:30.461
[Annie] We're being robbed!

35:33.214 --> 35:34.257
Where are you--

35:38.594 --> 35:39.762
[gasps]

35:40.471 --> 35:41.514
What?

35:42.390 --> 35:43.432
Hey, you!

35:50.106 --> 35:51.899
Well, that seemed unnecessary.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.119
[both gasp]

36:03.411 --> 36:06.873
I see that we have a proverbial
Mexican stand-off here,

36:06.956 --> 36:08.541
with me being an actual Mexican.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.917
Drop the thumbtack!

36:10.001 --> 36:11.961
-Drop the raccoon!
-It's a pine martin.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.131
-Why'd you break in?
-Break in? That's racist.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.884
And stupid because there's
nothing in here worth stealing.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.177
Well, then why are you here?

36:19.343 --> 36:20.219
To clean.

36:20.303 --> 36:23.431
I'm Manny, the magic fairy
who appears each night

36:23.723 --> 36:25.183
to scrub your toilets.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.350
Why'd you run?

36:26.434 --> 36:28.311
And what's
with all the crazy parkour?

36:28.394 --> 36:29.896
You scared the bejesus out of me.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.190
And where I come from,
that's not called parkour,

36:32.398 --> 36:35.526
it's called "get the hell
out of Dodge, ICE is coming".

36:35.693 --> 36:37.028
Oh. Fair enough.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.738
God, you're fast.

36:39.071 --> 36:39.947
Thank you.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.616
And a Schmood employee?

36:42.283 --> 36:43.618
Guys, this is Manny.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.244
He's joining our team.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.871
Anything you wanna say, big guy?

36:47.205 --> 36:48.873
Stop peeing on the toilet seats.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.041
It's disgusting.

36:53.127 --> 36:56.505
Manny is the ninth player
we've been looking for.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.007
He completes us.

36:58.090 --> 37:01.052
For the first time, we can
finally field a full team.

37:03.262 --> 37:05.848
That was supposed to be inspiring.

37:06.682 --> 37:10.436
Anyway, he's gonna hit lead off
and play second,

37:10.519 --> 37:11.854
moving Dougie to right.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.940
Anybody know
who we're playing today?

37:20.738 --> 37:22.114
Go! Go Manny!

37:28.537 --> 37:29.997
Go, go, go, go, go!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.749
[cheering]

37:34.752 --> 37:36.712
-Safe!
-Yeah!

37:38.965 --> 37:41.634
We're ahead.
Hey, we're actually ahead!

37:41.801 --> 37:43.552
[cheering]

37:43.886 --> 37:45.221
Take it, I barely had any.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.640
I shouldn't. Not while
I'm carrying Jeff's baby.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.476
You're not carrying Jeff's baby.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.783
It's all right, we'll get 'em.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.123
I'm so ashamed.
I'm letting the team down.

38:12.206 --> 38:15.334
-[team protests]
-No, Kashmir, what are you talking about?

38:17.628 --> 38:19.463
Maybe first base isn't for you.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.049
It's not the base, Ben.
It's the sport.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.385
I joined this team because
it was the closest thing

38:24.468 --> 38:26.012
I could find to my beloved cricket.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.556
But the similarities
are greatly exaggerated.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.683
I mean, in cricket,
we don't even use a glove.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.019
Then don't.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.020
Don't what?

38:34.186 --> 38:35.479
Use a glove.

38:40.693 --> 38:41.610
[grunts]

38:41.694 --> 38:43.696
Yeah! Great catch, Kashmir!

38:43.779 --> 38:45.489
Or whatever they call it in cricket!

38:46.574 --> 38:47.950
We just call it a catch.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.669
[screaming]

38:59.462 --> 39:01.088
Monica!

39:02.840 --> 39:04.550
-Can I get one of those?
-A tattoo?

39:04.842 --> 39:05.718
A hairy chest.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.303
I couldn't be prouder.

39:07.636 --> 39:09.847
Keep your heads up, we got this.
We got this.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.557
Last ups, we can do this!

39:11.724 --> 39:13.601
-We're so close!
-[Krinsky] What's the point?

39:13.893 --> 39:16.270
We're giving everything we got
and we still can't catch 'em.

39:16.604 --> 39:17.688
I'm sorry, Ben.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.857
But this team has no fire.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.034
What did you call us?

39:30.284 --> 39:31.160
Losers?

39:31.994 --> 39:32.828
Failures?

39:32.912 --> 39:33.829
Bottom feeders?

39:33.913 --> 39:36.290
Oh, did you say, suckers?

39:36.415 --> 39:38.167
We take offense to that!

39:38.918 --> 39:40.211
What're you talking about?

39:40.294 --> 39:41.504
He hasn't said anything the whole game.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.755
Oh, and you.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.590
Your momma
wouldn't know a strike

39:44.673 --> 39:47.551
if it sat on her lap
and introduced itself.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.388
How dare you bring
my momma's lap into this?

39:50.596 --> 39:53.224
Well, how about
a little bit of this?

39:53.474 --> 39:54.475
Well, how about a taste of this?

39:54.558 --> 39:55.768
Oh, yeah? Well, what about that?

39:55.851 --> 39:59.397
-Well, how about some of this?
-[scuffing ground]

39:59.480 --> 40:00.439
You're outta here!

40:00.523 --> 40:02.274
-Oh, you gotta be kidding me!
-I'm not kidding!

40:02.358 --> 40:03.609
How could you?

40:03.859 --> 40:06.278
This is unbelievable!

40:08.030 --> 40:10.783
Man, you have the coolest dad ever.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.493
I can hear you.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.411
Shh.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.246
There's something happening right now.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.374
Yeah, it's called a rally.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.960
Let's finish this!

40:21.252 --> 40:22.211
For Ben!

40:22.294 --> 40:24.505
[cheering]

40:39.270 --> 40:40.187
Safe!

40:41.147 --> 40:43.232
That's an RBI from an HUI.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.359
Hitting under the influence. Boom!

40:55.119 --> 40:56.203
Yeah!

40:57.580 --> 41:00.749
[cheering]

41:01.500 --> 41:02.543
We won!

41:03.335 --> 41:05.129
-[cheering]
-We won!

41:10.259 --> 41:13.179
[cheering continues]

41:18.601 --> 41:21.020
We just won our first game!

41:21.103 --> 41:24.607
[cheering]

41:24.982 --> 41:26.859
Hey, it feels pretty good, doesn't it?

41:27.276 --> 41:30.905
So you just pretended they
called us losers to motivate us.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.741
That's some serious Jedi mind stuff.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.117
Of course, given our record,

41:35.201 --> 41:36.702
that would have been factually correct.

41:37.036 --> 41:39.330
We are still technically losers.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.040
[Mel] No.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.169
You're benchwarmers.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.172
I've seen this magic before.

41:49.215 --> 41:52.635
A group of misfits who comes
together to form a team.

41:53.511 --> 41:56.305
A team that learns
to believe in each other,

41:56.805 --> 42:01.852
and somehow, against all odds,
finds a way to win.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.523
You remind me of that team.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.525
You're the Benchwarmers.

42:07.608 --> 42:11.487
-[all] To the Benchwarmers!
-[cheering]

42:13.697 --> 42:16.700
[phone rings]

42:19.453 --> 42:20.287
Hello?

42:20.371 --> 42:21.330
It's Arthur.

42:21.413 --> 42:24.083
I can't talk long but I just
read the engineer's report.

42:24.166 --> 42:29.046
I noticed it's numbered 78446-B
but there's no 78446-A.

42:29.838 --> 42:30.839
I don't know what that means.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.551
Well, it might mean that
the engineer wrote an earlier report

42:33.634 --> 42:34.969
but then changed his mind and--

42:35.219 --> 42:36.470
Oh, oh, hold on.

42:36.804 --> 42:37.972
Uh, yes.

42:38.055 --> 42:40.849
He likes when you draw
a puppy in the foam.

42:42.351 --> 42:45.563
Anyway, it could help to get
a hold of that earlier report.

43:00.369 --> 43:01.453
How dare you?

43:02.079 --> 43:05.416
You think you're my master, able
to summon me by ringing a bell?

43:06.083 --> 43:08.127
Why have a bell if...

43:09.169 --> 43:10.212
Never mind.

43:10.296 --> 43:12.131
Um, we need to see the file

43:12.214 --> 43:14.258
on the Reedy's Hole
sewage-plant proposal.

43:14.466 --> 43:16.719
And whom is asking?

43:16.927 --> 43:18.220
I don't think that's right.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.514
It's public record
so it shouldn't be a problem.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.182
Great.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.817
[files rustling]

43:36.572 --> 43:37.489
Thank you.

43:43.203 --> 43:44.163
It's gone.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.000
Excuse me.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.295
Excuse me, sir?

43:51.462 --> 43:52.504
Let's sharpen that up.

43:55.841 --> 43:59.136
Tell me you didn't
just ring that bell.

43:59.386 --> 44:02.389
Uh, report number 78446-A?

44:02.473 --> 44:03.307
It's missing.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.392
And what do you want me
to do about it?

44:05.559 --> 44:06.727
Look for it?

44:06.935 --> 44:07.811
Please?

44:12.024 --> 44:14.860
-It's not here.
-We know it's not here.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.779
She meant go look for it
somewhere else.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.031
Well, if it's not here,
then it's been misfiled or,

44:19.114 --> 44:21.158
more likely, "misfiled".

44:21.367 --> 44:23.452
-What's the difference?
-One's not on purpose.

44:24.161 --> 44:25.496
You need to see the chief engineer.

44:25.579 --> 44:27.498
Then we'd like to see
the chief engineer.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.124
-He's on "vacation".
-"Vacation"?

44:29.249 --> 44:31.460
Did I say "vacation"?
I meant vacation.

44:34.296 --> 44:35.881
What is happening here?

44:36.465 --> 44:37.633
[sighs]

44:37.800 --> 44:38.926
Missing reports,

44:39.009 --> 44:40.844
the chief engineer was "unavailable"?

44:41.261 --> 44:43.013
They are obviously up to something.

44:46.266 --> 44:47.393
It's not "whom".

45:17.506 --> 45:19.007
[cheering]

45:31.395 --> 45:32.271
[whoops]

45:49.538 --> 45:51.081
The lawyer who sporked Monica.

45:52.291 --> 45:53.834
This one's personal.

45:54.501 --> 45:57.337
This one's for Monica, you monster!

45:58.005 --> 45:59.006
[Monica] Oscar?

46:00.883 --> 46:02.593
-Monica.
-[Monica sighs]

46:02.968 --> 46:05.512
I have never seen so much
passion from you.

46:05.762 --> 46:07.598
It's all I ever really wanted.

46:08.223 --> 46:10.893
You care. You really care.

46:11.268 --> 46:12.519
Si, Mon.

46:12.978 --> 46:13.896
Si.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.232
[exhales]

46:21.528 --> 46:24.072
[cheering]

46:27.326 --> 46:29.036
Oh, yes!

46:29.369 --> 46:30.954
[pants]

46:31.246 --> 46:35.584
A toast, to us making the playoffs
and a speedy recovery

46:36.001 --> 46:39.129
to those who suffered minor
electrical injuries as a result.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.799
[cheering]

46:43.842 --> 46:44.801
Dad?

46:47.429 --> 46:48.597
Yeah, what is it, buddy?

46:48.680 --> 46:52.059
I was thinking maybe I could
postpone the math camp.

46:52.559 --> 46:53.769
I mean, until later in the summer.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.979
You're gonna need your stat keeper

46:56.063 --> 46:57.606
during the post-season, right?

46:59.149 --> 47:00.859
I think we can work something out.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.320
Come here.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.492
Check out
my regular season stats, Iris.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.160
It's all about power.

47:10.786 --> 47:13.455
Raw, unadulterated power.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.040
You reek of it, sir.

47:15.707 --> 47:16.917
And, of course,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.127
still dominating
with the top playoff seed

47:19.211 --> 47:21.213
is Stenhouse and Gray.

47:21.797 --> 47:23.173
Two games up on...

47:26.802 --> 47:28.011
Schmood?

47:28.679 --> 47:29.680
[phone rings]

47:31.306 --> 47:32.224
[Mel] McGrath!

47:32.933 --> 47:34.101
You wanna see me, sir?

47:34.184 --> 47:36.019
I just got a notice from the city.

47:36.103 --> 47:39.022
Instead of building the sewage
plant in downtown Reedy's Hole,

47:39.106 --> 47:40.524
they wanna put it here!

47:40.691 --> 47:41.650
What do you mean, here?

47:41.817 --> 47:43.235
Here. Literally.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.153
My desk is ground zero.

47:45.404 --> 47:47.155
[Number 7] Perfect.
Rubbish to rubbish.

47:47.322 --> 47:48.282
[Mel] Save it, Number 7.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.409
They're obviously trying
to intimidate us.

47:50.492 --> 47:51.952
Well, it's working.

47:52.077 --> 47:54.329
The only chance
Schmood and Associates has

47:54.413 --> 47:55.831
is you winning this case.

47:55.914 --> 47:56.957
[hangs up]

47:57.916 --> 48:00.002
So, after careful examination,

48:00.168 --> 48:02.504
the location of the plant
can't be justified

48:02.588 --> 48:04.631
based on current field conditions.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.216
Mr. Wilde.

48:06.300 --> 48:10.512
Yeah, I'm lactose-intolerant
yet I'm craving a cappuccino.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.139
What would you suggest?

48:12.389 --> 48:13.307
Mr. Chairman,

48:13.390 --> 48:15.976
he didn't even let the witness
finish his last sentence.

48:16.101 --> 48:17.060
Overruled.

48:17.644 --> 48:20.022
I, too, am lactose-intolerant.

48:22.316 --> 48:26.486
-Answer the question.
-Um, perhaps a cap soy dry?

48:27.321 --> 48:28.363
Ooh...

48:29.906 --> 48:31.283
Sounds delish.

48:31.575 --> 48:36.121
So is it fair to say that your
level of actual field expertise

48:36.204 --> 48:37.372
since you've left school

48:37.456 --> 48:39.041
basically pertains to...

48:40.667 --> 48:42.210
coffee products?

48:42.794 --> 48:43.629
I guess.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.339
And one more question.

48:45.422 --> 48:47.299
What grade did you get in your

48:47.382 --> 48:50.093
Design of Water Treatment
Facilities course?

48:52.387 --> 48:53.513
Uh, a D plus.

48:53.597 --> 48:56.224
A D plus.

48:56.391 --> 48:57.601
Good boy.

48:58.518 --> 48:59.728
[clicks tongue] Your witness.

49:01.355 --> 49:02.522
Anything else?

49:02.648 --> 49:05.692
Uh... one second.

49:05.776 --> 49:06.735
Um...

49:06.818 --> 49:08.362
[beeping]

49:08.737 --> 49:10.113
[text bleeps]

49:15.118 --> 49:16.119
Uh...

49:17.913 --> 49:18.955
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

49:20.082 --> 49:22.417
Why did you get a D plus in
your water-facilities course?

49:22.668 --> 49:26.963
Okay, it was the night before
my final and I was studying

49:27.047 --> 49:28.924
when these two women next door
asked if I could help

49:29.007 --> 49:31.301
with a leak in their shower,
which I did.

49:31.468 --> 49:33.470
And afterwards they offered
to thank me with a beer,

49:33.553 --> 49:35.347
which turned into, well, several,

49:35.430 --> 49:37.849
which turned into one
of those crazy hugfests

49:38.100 --> 49:41.436
which turned into, well,
the most amazing three-way ever!

49:41.520 --> 49:43.855
I mean, I'm talking a kaleidoscope

49:43.939 --> 49:46.650
of flesh and passion.

49:46.775 --> 49:49.945
By the time I woke up,
I missed my final.

49:51.071 --> 49:52.531
[laughs]

49:53.031 --> 49:55.701
I mean, I figured
when would I get another chance?

49:55.992 --> 49:57.035
[groans]

49:59.287 --> 50:01.957
I accept this man as an expert!

50:02.666 --> 50:03.959
You did the right thing, son.

50:04.251 --> 50:05.627
Oh, boy.

50:09.089 --> 50:12.342
Uh, then, Mr. Chairman,

50:12.426 --> 50:14.886
next we'd like to call
the assistant chief engineer.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.681
What? No.

50:17.764 --> 50:21.268
As McGrath knows, the assistant
did not write that report.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.145
If he wants to know its contents,

50:23.311 --> 50:25.689
he needs to address the chief engineer.

50:25.814 --> 50:30.736
Who has somehow mysteriously
disappeared into thin air.

50:31.027 --> 50:33.613
Mr. Chairman, we need
to call a continuance

50:33.697 --> 50:35.323
until we can find this witness.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.785
If McGrath wants a continuance,
then Schmood should have

50:38.869 --> 50:42.038
to cover all of this city's legal costs,
should he lose.

50:42.122 --> 50:43.331
Works for me.

50:44.207 --> 50:45.292
[grunts]

50:50.547 --> 50:54.634
[woman in movie] Oh, Marcus,
fate has finally brought us together.

50:55.177 --> 50:57.679
Tell us again why we had to meet
at a movie theater.

50:57.929 --> 50:59.306
[loud shushing]

50:59.473 --> 51:00.515
Sorry.

51:01.057 --> 51:02.976
You never know who might be listening.

51:04.311 --> 51:07.022
Anyway, this is Ray Capposseri.

51:07.272 --> 51:08.440
He's the chief engineer,

51:08.523 --> 51:10.609
and our only chance of winning
the Reedy's Hole case.

51:10.776 --> 51:12.277
We need to find him ASAP.

51:12.360 --> 51:13.487
Mmm-hmm.

51:13.737 --> 51:15.989
-Capiletti.
-No, Capposseri.

51:16.239 --> 51:18.700
He's supposedly on vacation
and could be anywhere.

51:18.867 --> 51:19.701
Canissetti.

51:19.785 --> 51:20.869
Capposseri.

51:20.952 --> 51:22.621
Here, I'll write it down for you.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.791
-[woman in movie] I'll never doubt again.
-[man in movie] You'll never have to.

51:27.209 --> 51:28.335
And you want me to find her.

51:28.418 --> 51:30.712
-[both] Him!
-[shushing]

51:31.004 --> 51:32.297
I'm sorry!

51:32.380 --> 51:34.299
And, yes, as fast as possible.

51:34.382 --> 51:36.176
It'll cost 20 grand minimum.

51:37.219 --> 51:39.888
We've got 400 bucks
minus our movie tickets.

51:40.305 --> 51:42.474
Consider this Carbonelli found.

51:45.727 --> 51:47.813
[both sigh]

51:48.647 --> 51:49.564
We're screwed.

51:49.731 --> 51:50.649
[sighs] You think?

51:51.942 --> 51:54.361
And a man down for tomorrow's game.

51:57.030 --> 52:01.493
Hey, you wouldn't wanna play for
us while he's gone, would you?

52:01.868 --> 52:05.288
Look, I admire what you're doing
with the team, I really do.

52:05.372 --> 52:06.915
It's just not for me.

52:06.998 --> 52:10.460
[woman in movie] Then take me, take me
like you've never taken me before.

52:13.463 --> 52:14.798
Oh, come on!

52:17.008 --> 52:18.009
[shushes]

52:21.012 --> 52:22.639
Now that we're a playoff team

52:22.722 --> 52:25.851
it's time
we look like a playoff team.

52:26.101 --> 52:27.477
Courtesy of Mel.

52:29.437 --> 52:31.690
[excited chatter]

52:31.857 --> 52:34.568
Now, unfortunately, Dobkins
can't be with us today,

52:34.651 --> 52:35.944
which means we're gonna need--

52:36.027 --> 52:37.362
[Mel] A savior.

52:42.784 --> 52:45.412
[Number 7] Run, Melanie.
It's a giant spandex tomato!

52:46.746 --> 52:48.248
Mel, I didn't know you played.

52:48.498 --> 52:49.332
I don't.

52:49.416 --> 52:53.128
But I can stand in the outfield
and chew gum like a pro.

52:56.256 --> 52:57.132
Sold.

52:57.215 --> 52:58.592
We'll put you in right,

52:58.758 --> 53:00.552
and, Dougie, we're gonna
move you to catcher.

53:00.719 --> 53:01.761
I'll do it!

53:06.975 --> 53:08.310
I'll play sober.

53:08.393 --> 53:09.603
[shocked gasps]

53:09.686 --> 53:12.939
Not what I asked but probably
best for your long-term health.

53:14.482 --> 53:16.318
All right, let's hit the field!

53:26.995 --> 53:32.375
[chanting] Om!

53:32.584 --> 53:33.793
Public-interest firm.

53:34.127 --> 53:35.170
They represent PETA

53:35.253 --> 53:36.963
and that
Save the Pink Dolphins organization.

53:37.714 --> 53:39.007
They believe humans and animals

53:39.090 --> 53:41.176
are all equal on God's great earth.

53:41.259 --> 53:44.137
-[cheering and applause]
-[man] Come on, Mel...

53:48.183 --> 53:49.392
[woman] We love you.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.020
Namaste.

53:52.103 --> 53:54.773
Nama-you-stay, you hippie,
away from me.

53:57.692 --> 54:00.820
Say, you do know the ball
is covered with cow hide, right?

54:01.404 --> 54:03.114
What? Oh!

54:03.281 --> 54:04.115
[laughs]

54:04.699 --> 54:07.118
Ugh!

54:09.496 --> 54:10.497
Oh, come on.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.375
[Number 7] Real proud
of yourself, aren't you?

54:13.458 --> 54:14.417
Well, guess what.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.169
You still look like a giant tomato.

54:16.753 --> 54:17.879
-[spits]
-Ew!

54:21.299 --> 54:23.969
Okay, we just need one more run.
Now, who's up?

54:27.305 --> 54:28.390
[panting and retches]

54:28.473 --> 54:29.683
[Kashmir] My God.

54:29.849 --> 54:31.893
Sober Dougie's like a normal person drunk.

54:32.060 --> 54:33.436
Dougie.

54:33.603 --> 54:35.063
Beer is your oxygen

54:35.146 --> 54:37.399
and quitting it
is exactly what should happen.

54:37.482 --> 54:38.900
But after this game.

54:39.818 --> 54:41.778
For the love of God, drink up.

54:42.028 --> 54:43.113
[opens can]

54:45.323 --> 54:46.199
More.

54:47.367 --> 54:49.035
That's it. Yes.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.371
You see?

54:53.832 --> 54:55.166
Rock and roll!

54:55.792 --> 54:57.419
-[cheering]
-Whoo!

54:58.712 --> 55:02.132
He just shotgunned a six-pack
and said "rock and roll."

55:02.215 --> 55:03.299
Are we bad people?

55:04.259 --> 55:05.176
Yes.

55:06.428 --> 55:07.429
Yes, we are.

55:12.517 --> 55:15.020
[cheering]

55:15.103 --> 55:18.356
All right! Take that Bud! Whoo-hoo!

55:20.066 --> 55:24.029
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

55:33.079 --> 55:33.913
I think he's dead.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.915
Nope. Just Canadian.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.878
In the event of an injury you're
allowed to pick a pinch runner.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.588
Manny, you're up.

55:41.671 --> 55:42.881
[Krinsky] No!

55:44.049 --> 55:45.175
I'm going in.

55:46.092 --> 55:48.053
You guys had a seventh-inning stretch,

55:48.720 --> 55:50.013
I had a tune-up.

56:15.663 --> 56:16.956
It's a squeeze play!

56:17.082 --> 56:19.125
That's one hell of a bunt!

56:22.754 --> 56:23.588
Bunt!

56:23.671 --> 56:25.757
I said, bunt!

56:26.925 --> 56:28.301
Man, that can't be legal.

56:29.803 --> 56:30.887
Damn, that's dope.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.437
I can't feel my legs.

56:39.687 --> 56:41.523
Welcome to the party, pal!

56:41.648 --> 56:45.193
[cheering]

57:05.630 --> 57:06.506
Hey.

57:07.090 --> 57:08.424
Glad you came by yesterday.

57:08.591 --> 57:09.801
Me too, coach.

57:09.968 --> 57:11.219
Your first playoff victory.

57:11.386 --> 57:12.720
Yeah.

57:12.846 --> 57:14.806
Don't let this get out,

57:14.889 --> 57:18.685
but I really think we got
a chance to go the distance.

57:19.018 --> 57:20.645
[phone rings]

57:21.855 --> 57:23.022
Dobkins?

57:23.273 --> 57:24.107
I'm with Ben.

57:24.190 --> 57:25.233
I can't talk long.

57:25.316 --> 57:27.110
I'm undercover
on the Capolinski case.

57:27.193 --> 57:28.570
[both] Capposseri.

57:28.736 --> 57:29.779
Right.

57:29.863 --> 57:30.989
That guy.

57:31.156 --> 57:33.116
Anyway, I got a bead on where he's at.

57:33.366 --> 57:34.200
Really? Where?

57:34.367 --> 57:35.285
On the road.

57:35.452 --> 57:36.536
Could you be more specific?

57:36.661 --> 57:37.579
Not really.

57:37.662 --> 57:39.581
He bought a $180,000 RV
and took off.

57:40.373 --> 57:41.374
Likely to Canada.

57:41.833 --> 57:42.750
Or Mexico.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.502
$180,000?

57:44.711 --> 57:45.795
Where'd he get that kind of money?

57:45.879 --> 57:47.088
I got other leads, too.

57:47.172 --> 57:49.924
He likes Croatian food
and Civil War reenactments.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.385
-That's it?
-I've found guys on less.

57:52.552 --> 57:54.053
[kids] Cannonball!

57:54.804 --> 57:56.473
Well, keep looking.

57:58.099 --> 57:59.100
What now?

57:59.184 --> 58:01.644
Without Capposseri, our only
hope is that missing report.

58:02.228 --> 58:03.229
Yep.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.565
Which means another trip to...

58:05.690 --> 58:09.694
[singing] ♪ Hey, there, Mr. Clerk Man
Am I annoying you? ♪

58:10.111 --> 58:12.155
♪ La la la la la la ♪

58:12.322 --> 58:15.033

Oh, my God!

58:17.118 --> 58:18.453
I am on a break!

58:18.578 --> 58:20.497
I don't care if you're on ecstasy, buddy.

58:20.663 --> 58:22.707
We need access to your files.

58:23.082 --> 58:24.209
You want access?

58:26.753 --> 58:28.213
I'll give you access.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.548
[door clicks and squeaks]

58:30.798 --> 58:33.384
Well, good luck
finding that missing report.

58:34.594 --> 58:37.430
Or should I say "missing"? [snickers]

58:41.226 --> 58:44.062
Well, that's five hours
we're never gonna get back.

58:44.646 --> 58:46.147
That file's not here.

58:47.607 --> 58:49.651
You know that, and I know that.

58:52.237 --> 58:53.696
But do they know that?

58:55.156 --> 58:56.366
You mean lie?

58:57.242 --> 59:01.329
Oh, you have a bright future
as a lawyer, young lady.

59:01.579 --> 59:02.914
[laughs]

59:04.082 --> 59:05.166
[clerk] Denied.

59:05.833 --> 59:06.834
Denied.

59:08.002 --> 59:09.212
Denied.

59:09.295 --> 59:11.965
[sing-song]
Yeah, we got the file!

59:12.215 --> 59:14.551
Hey, hey, hey! There's no joy
allowed in this office.

59:14.634 --> 59:15.677
Oh, no problem.

59:15.760 --> 59:17.220
We found
what we were looking for.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.013
Thanks for your help.
[blows kiss]

59:20.640 --> 59:22.225
My... help?

59:28.439 --> 59:30.149
They found the original report.

59:30.316 --> 59:31.734
That's impossible.

59:31.818 --> 59:34.237
Capposseri assured me
that all copies were destroyed.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.197
Well, one must have slipped through.

59:36.781 --> 59:38.533
I can't survive prison, I'm too pretty.

59:38.741 --> 59:40.118
Nobody's going to prison,

59:40.285 --> 59:42.453
and you're the furthest thing
from pretty!

59:42.954 --> 59:43.871
Let me handle it.

59:44.038 --> 59:45.415
[hangs up]

59:46.583 --> 59:47.458
[frightened gasp]

59:48.126 --> 59:49.168
Your serve!

59:49.711 --> 59:50.628
[screams]

59:52.088 --> 59:54.299
All this waiting is killing me.

59:55.466 --> 59:57.969
You really think Stenhouse
is gonna take the bait?

59:58.428 --> 59:59.512
[sighs]

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:03.182
I don't know,
but whatever happens,

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.977
Ben, I'm really grateful
for all your help.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.771
You're welcome.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.815
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:14.277
It's certainly possible,
what're you thinking?

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.029
-You go first.
-No, you go first.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.447
No, really, you.

01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:19.782
If I go first and I'm wrong,

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.201
it could result
in me being disbarred.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:25.288
Then again if I'm right,
it would be engaging

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:30.209
in an illicit relationship with
a fellow employee that would...

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.355
[phone rings]

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:51.564
[Annie] Is that yours or mine?

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:52.815
[Ben] Yours or mine what?

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.776
[Annie] Phone. We should get it.

01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:56.235
It could be important.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:58.946
[phone ringing]

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:00.782
Hello?

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:02.825
I'm ready to talk settlement.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:04.911
Settlement?

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.829
One that leaves
Schmood untouched,

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.415
and helps
those Reedy's Hole idiots.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.626
-Great.
-Right now?

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.419
Yes, right now.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.296
Do you wanna settle or not?

01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:21.678
As the town's business leaders,
you should know

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:23.721
there's been a major development
in the case.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:27.934
We're close to exposing
the whole process as corrupt,

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.852
which is why the city's
made a settlement offer.

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.646
It's a sign they're worried,

01:01:31.729 --> 01:01:33.564
meaning we have all the leverage.

01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:34.816
What kind of settlement?

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:38.319
Well, increasing the amount that
they'll pay for your properties.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:39.320
How much more?

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.364
-40 percent.
-[gasps]

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.199
On top of what they offered before?

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:45.910
Yes, but all your businesses
will get shut down.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.995
-Yes!
-Whoo-hoo!

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.290
Now, this is a happy ending!

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.583
-[slaps]
-Whoo!

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.506
[Ben exhales]

01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:00.299
Look, I don't get it.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.093
I thought you wanted
Stenhouse to settle.

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:05.138
I thought so, too,
but now I'm not so sure.

01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:08.641
Hey, look. In our business,
this counts as a win.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.228
I mean, sure, Reedy's Hole
is gonna get torn up,

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:16.190
but the residents will be 40 percent
off better than they were.

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:20.027
And Schmood gets to stay
in business, so...

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:21.612
But it's not right.

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:22.989
Doesn't that matter?

01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:28.161
When I was a little girl,
I always felt different

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:29.787
coming from here.

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.497
People would make fun of us

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:32.999
and they said we weren't
as good as they were.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.586
but one day, our school went
on a field trip to the city,

01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:38.713
to a baseball game.

01:02:39.213 --> 01:02:41.048
A game where three guys
let all the kids

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.675
who'd ever been bullied play.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.928
It was a game dedicated
to the underdogs.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.513
You know who made
that game possible?

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:48.931
Jay-Z?

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.141
Mel.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.269
That day, he leveled
the playing field.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.606
He showed me that everyone
is special, including me.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.858
And that sticking up
for the little guy

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:00.818
is the right thing to do.

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:05.072
Ben, with Reedy's Hole, we have
a chance to do the right thing.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.993
But if we settle, the bullies win.

01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:14.832
I really wanna kiss you right now.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:27.220
Do you wanna go in and have sex?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.182
Yes, I do.

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:49.033
I need a bathroom,
bathroom, bathroom.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:52.578
Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee,
gotta pee, gotta pee.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.080
[crashing]

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.207
[shushes softly]

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:19.689
Softball!

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.733
-Liar!
-[screams] What's happening?

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:24.443
I just saw your trophy room!

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.571
You said
you didn't play softball!

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:28.656
I never said I didn't!

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:30.408
I said it wasn't for me!

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:36.080
Why not? You've got a room
full of hardware in there

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:38.666
that says you were the winningest pitcher
in softball history!

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:41.586
I was also the miserablest
pitcher in softball history!

01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:43.421
It brought out the worst in me.

01:04:43.629 --> 01:04:45.715
It turned me into the one thing
I hate most.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.925
A win-at-all-costs douchebag.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.136
So, I gave it up.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:51.429
I went to law school instead.

01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:53.931
You went to law school
to be better liked?

01:04:54.348 --> 01:04:55.391
You should go.

01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:57.852
Wait, Annie, no.

01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.312
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.981
I didn't--
Look, I didn't mean to--

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:03.608
Just do me one favor.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.860
Hold off a day before
accepting Stenhouse's offer.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:08.154
Give Dobkins a little more time
to find Capposseri.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:09.572
Well, that'll take a miracle.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.324
I believe in miracles.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.161
[sighs]

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.663
[Ben] I still gotta pee!

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:25.671
Ben.

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:28.341
What a pleasant surprise.

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:31.218
I hear you kicked ass
in the Reedy's Hole case

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:33.179
and forced our former boss
to offer a settlement.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:36.390
Well, kicked ass is probably
a bit of an overstatement

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:39.518
And, uh, did you say
"our former boss"?

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:40.728
I left.

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:42.063
For Forman Lasker.

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:44.398
Wow. Forman Lasker's no joke.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:47.318
And, more importantly, no Stenhouse.

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:50.655
You know, they are still hiring,

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:53.366
and I'm on my way to meet the
managing partners right now.

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:54.951
Care for an introduction?

01:05:58.162 --> 01:05:59.163
Late?

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:00.706
This is the first semi-final game

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.291
in Schmood's pathetic history.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.336
I know, Mel, and I promise I'll
get there as quickly as I can.

01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:07.797
You guys will be just fine
without me.

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:09.465
Oh!

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:11.300
Ben's going to be late.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.885
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:15.304
Hey. Hey, don't panic.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.222
We'll be fine.

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.723
[man] Hey, there's the wimps
we're playing.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:26.899
Can we panic now?

01:06:31.278 --> 01:06:32.154
Ben.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.950
Come on, they're gonna love you.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.379
Hey, what's going on? I couldn't
have missed more than one inning.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:49.880
[Mel] That's all it took.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.426
They scored ten runs in
the first and called the game.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.511
Season fini.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:57.805
Where were you, man?

01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:01.308
I, uh... was held up
by a law thing.

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:03.853
[Number 7] Oh, really?

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.896
Team's all commiserating at Morty's.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.106
-See you there?
-No.

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:09.942
I really...
I should get Jack home.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:12.862
Hey, bud. Uh...

01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:20.911
Where were you for real, Dad?

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:25.624
I was meeting someone
about a new job.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:28.002
You mean you might leave
the Benchwarmers?

01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:30.546
It would be
for a high-class firm.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.590
It could be a big opportunity.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.217
What about the nobility of futility?

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:41.640
-[rock music playing]
-[cheering]

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.059
Look at them.

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.853
[cheering]

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.189
Nobody's born with that kind of body.

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.441
[Number 7] Nobody on this team. [laughs]

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:51.734
They're obviously 'roided up.

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:52.985
Hemorrhoids?

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.278
Steroids.

01:07:54.361 --> 01:07:56.489
-Oh.
-But they should be disqualified.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:57.948
Sure, but how do we prove it?

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:00.284
They're not going to voluntarily
give us their urine.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:02.453
And it's not like we can
just order them rounds of beer

01:08:02.536 --> 01:08:05.414
to make them pee and then sneak
some inanimate object

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.541
into the urinal to collect a sample.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:11.670
Oh, waiter.

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.383
[Number 7] What's happening?
Where am I?

01:08:16.716 --> 01:08:18.010
What's with the echo?

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.636
-[door opens]
-Is somebody there?

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:20.679
[unzipping]

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:21.971
Oh, ahh! Ahh!

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:24.433
The horror! The horror!

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:27.103
[phone rings]

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:28.187
Hello?

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.772
It's me. Dobkins.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.524
Dobkins, have you found him?

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.276
-Found who?
-Capposseri.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:35.486
Oh.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.529
No, but I'm getting close.

01:08:38.154 --> 01:08:39.740
I've narrowed it down to Asia.

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:40.825
But don't worry.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.952
I've got a bead on
a rare Mongolian metals dealer

01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:44.245
who may have some info.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:46.330
[sighs]

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.586
I'm sorry, Annie.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:54.630
[dials]

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:56.298
[phone ringing]

01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:04.640
[clears throat] McGrath.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.850
We'll accept your settlement offer.

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:13.189
Don't sound so disappointed, McGrath.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.234
Everyone has their price.

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:25.452
Ben, did you hear?

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:28.288
We got proof the team
that beat us was doping.

01:09:28.455 --> 01:09:30.124
They've been suspended by the league,

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.417
which means
we're in the championship game.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.420
We play Stenhouse and Gray tomorrow.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.837
Isn't that great news?

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.798
Yeah, um...

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.216
Guys, I'm actually--

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.426
[Annie] Leaving Schmood?

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.729
I took a job with Forman Lasker.

01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:56.025
I um... I was gonna call ya.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.860
I was gonna call you, too.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.321
I spoke with Mayor White.

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:03.282
I convinced her that she and the citizens
of Reedy's Hole should keep fighting.

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:06.035
Oh, Annie, it's too late.

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:09.914
I already accepted Stenhouse's offer.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.212
It's not always about winning
and losing, you know.

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:18.464
It's about playing the right way.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.343
What are we doing?

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.305
We should be thanking Ben
for everything he's done for us

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.516
and wishing him the best,
wherever his journey takes him.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:51.455
-Play ball!
-[cheering]

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.754
We wanted to review some of
the options and when we did,

01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:00.464
we found
that there was a fourth option,

01:11:00.547 --> 01:11:02.466
so we definitely
went through that...

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.426
All right!

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.304
Let's put these losers
in their loser place.

01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:09.098
No matter what happens today,

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.935
each and every one of us
deserves to be here.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.646
Now, Benchwarmers on three.

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:18.857
One, two, three.

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:20.484
[all] Benchwarmers!

01:11:27.157 --> 01:11:28.284
Is everything okay?

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:29.827
You seem distracted.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:33.789
I'm sorry, everyone.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:39.253
But my team needs me.

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:49.013
Well, well. Look at you,
working at Forman Lasker now.

01:11:49.346 --> 01:11:50.514
Not anymore.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:51.974
You got fired again?

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:54.226
For the love of God, Ben!
I cannot keep up!

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.936
Can I just talk to Jack, please?

01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:57.354
I don't think that's a very good idea.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.106
He is very upset
about you leaving Schmood.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.816
Well, he should be.

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:02.860
So just tell him one thing.

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:06.572
I embrace the nobility of futility.

01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:08.490
The what of the what now?

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:12.286
That's okay, Mom. I heard.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:15.080
So what do you say, buddy?

01:12:15.539 --> 01:12:17.374
You wanna catch a ball game with me?

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:23.380
[cheering and applause]

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.427
Great day for a ball game.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:30.596
Ben.

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:33.307
Hi.

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:34.308
Hey.

01:12:34.391 --> 01:12:35.768
I'm gonna go sit with Melanie.

01:12:35.976 --> 01:12:36.810
Good luck, Dad.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:37.936
Thanks, buddy.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:47.613
So, listen.

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.114
I've come up with a plan
to save Reedy's Hole

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.575
but it's gonna require
several miracles happening.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.494
Well, you know
how I feel about miracles.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:54.661
What are they?

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.955
First is you accepting my apology

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.540
for trying to force you to play.

01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:01.043
It's your decision and I should
have respected that.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.296
Apology accepted.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:06.757
Miracle number one accomplished.

01:13:11.261 --> 01:13:13.430
That was miracle number two.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:15.557
Miracle number three?

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.226
Getting Stenhouse
to drop the settlement

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:20.145
and buying Dobkins
more time to find Capposseri.

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:23.482
Hey Mel,
can I have my old job back?

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:25.901
Didn't know you left.

01:13:27.277 --> 01:13:28.737
We're only up by two.

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:31.490
We should be crushing these idiots!

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.992
I suspect poor coaching.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:36.829
Well...

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.540
I thought you moved on, McGrath.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.500
We had some unfinished business.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.252
Like delivering you
a copy of what we found

01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:45.045
in the zoning commission office.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:49.758
Blank pages?

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.176
A trick to get me to settle?

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.928
Well, I could have
your law license for this.

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.472
But if you really feel that way,

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:57.057
we'll let you pull out of the deal.

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:00.644
No, no. I smell another trick.

01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:01.937
No dice.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:04.064
[Mel] Then how about a bet?

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:08.986
A bet?

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:10.195
On the game.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.615
You win, they put the
sewage plant on Schmood's lot.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.368
I'll even throw in
my Gandhi-toenail paper weight.

01:14:17.077 --> 01:14:18.370
And if you win?

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.956
The city leaves Schmood
and Reedy's Hole alone

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:25.377
and puts the plant wherever it
was originally slated to go...

01:14:29.089 --> 01:14:29.965
And?

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.425
And what?

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:34.761
And why would I take that deal?
I already have a settlement.

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:37.055
You don't wanna pay those idiots,

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.766
as you call 'em, 40 percent
more than you planned.

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.102
Winners don't settle.

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:43.979
Unless the great Gordon Stenhouse

01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:47.524
is scared of losing
to a bunch of benchwarmers.

01:14:53.113 --> 01:14:53.947
Fine.

01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:55.032
Deal.

01:14:55.115 --> 01:14:56.408
We're up by two anyway.

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:00.704
I trust you know what you're doing.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:01.705
Not at all.

01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:02.915
Good enough for me.

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:05.834
That's what I'm paying you for!

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.256
That's lookin' good, fellas!

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:12.508
Let her rip!

01:15:13.717 --> 01:15:14.843
[wolf-whistle]

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.347
[Stenhouse] Oh, there she is!
The sexy stench-warmer!

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:19.932
Hey, put your hips into it, baby!

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.016
Let's go!

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:22.351
You want sexy?

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.770
I'll give you sexy.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.188
You pervs.

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:38.033
[cheering]

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:41.286
[Stenhouse] She's not that hot,
you idiots! Field the ball!

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.789
What, you got an anchor
tied to your ass?

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:45.374
[laughs]

01:15:58.762 --> 01:15:59.638
Dammit!

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:14.736
Time!

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:19.575
That's right,
sit your loser butt down.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:22.077
You look totally gassed, Howard.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:23.495
I'll be okay.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.747
Feeling should come back
to my arm any second now.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.291
[Annie] Put me in, coach!

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.503
Miracle number four.

01:16:33.171 --> 01:16:35.966
I object!
This woman is not on the roster.

01:16:36.216 --> 01:16:38.093
As long as a person's
an employee of the firm,

01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:39.303
it's by the rules.

01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:41.680
So why don't you sit
your butt down, Mr. Stenhouse?

01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:43.807
Please.

01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:48.312
I'm taking you out, Howard.

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.530
I have to warn you,

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.574
you're really not gonna like
the person I become when I play.

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:03.577
Come on, how bad
can Softball Annie be?

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.331
Let's go, doofus!

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:10.208
Get that candy ass of yours
on up to my plate!

01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:12.628
Mama's hungry.

01:17:17.424 --> 01:17:18.342
Whoa.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:23.930
-[yells]
-Strike three!

01:17:24.097 --> 01:17:26.433
-You're out!
-Suck on that, princess!

01:17:26.516 --> 01:17:27.768
Whew!

01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:30.354
All right, send up the next turd, huh?

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:32.606
Good lord, she's like Gollum.

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:35.525
Hey, ferret face, nibble on this!

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:37.819
Strike one!

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.697
Strike two!

01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:43.992
-Strike three!
-Oh!

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.161
Yeah! Let's go, Annie!

01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:48.497
Get on home to Kansas, Dorothy! [spits]

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:50.123
One more, one more!

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.001
You.

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.047
Strike one!

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:00.509
Strike two!

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:02.010
This is for Ben!

01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:04.721
Strike three! You're out!

01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:06.682
[yelling]

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:07.891
Yes!

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:10.185
I own you now, butt boy.

01:18:10.435 --> 01:18:11.561
Butt boy?

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:16.817
I warned you, didn't I?

01:18:16.983 --> 01:18:18.360
That you did.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:20.028
So how'd it feel out there?

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:21.988
Freakin' amazing!

01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:23.198
Oorah!

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:24.908
[Annie] Yeah!

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:26.660
[Ben] All right guys, listen up.

01:18:26.743 --> 01:18:28.537
We got one inning
to get four runs.

01:18:28.745 --> 01:18:29.663
Let's do it!

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.627
[cheering]

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:36.962
Come on!

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:39.923
[cheering]

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.134
[Ben]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:43.468
-Safe!
-Safe!

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.472
Bring it!

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:49.558
Ball.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.643
Ball.

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:53.478
Ball.

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:55.147
Ball four.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:56.565
Take your base.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:57.566
[clank]

01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:59.067
And Krinsky walks.

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:00.944
How about that?

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:02.279
Okay, good work!

01:19:02.362 --> 01:19:03.739
Good eye, Krinsky!

01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:05.240
Good eye, buddy!

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:07.409
Seriously?

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.077
Go get 'em.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:13.957
Bring 'em home, baby!

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:16.418
[grunts]

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:28.180
Did her water just break?

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:30.640
She really was carrying Jeff's baby!

01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:33.059
No wonder Jeff hung himself.

01:19:33.226 --> 01:19:34.728
We need to get her to the hospital.

01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:38.356
Stop! You're not taking me anywhere.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.776
You've got a game to win.

01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:43.278
Taxi!

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:45.489
Oh, God, oh.

01:19:45.572 --> 01:19:47.491
[laughing]

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:49.910
[Stenhouse] That's unbelievable.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.163
Well, I guess that's it.

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.832
Schmood is officially out of hitters.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.423
There's still one hitter left.

01:20:08.345 --> 01:20:09.304
Time!

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:15.644
Pitching change.

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.189
You're gonna love this, McGrath.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:22.609
I recently hired
a new receptionist.

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:24.820
[helicopter approaching]

01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:48.218
I believe you two have met.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:56.226
[chuckles]

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.161
Hey, Jack?

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:21.793
Any chance I could borrow
that protective cup, buddy?

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.211
I'm not wearing it, Dad.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.464
I don't need it anymore.

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:37.976
[exhales]

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:52.908
Strike one.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:53.867
Yes!

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:54.993
Well done!

01:21:57.662 --> 01:21:58.788
[exhales]

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:01.958
Strike two.

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:04.461
[laughs] You feel that wind?

01:22:23.855 --> 01:22:24.689
Foul ball.

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:25.899
[groaning]

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:27.192
Time!

01:22:32.405 --> 01:22:33.365
Hit him.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.201
In the balls.

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.244
What? I could strike
this bum out in my sleep.

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.289
I am paying you 20 grand
for an hour to do what I want.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:45.710
And what I want is to see this
loser crawling on the ground,

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.129
cradling the remnants
of his shattered manhood.

01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:49.631
Do you understand?

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:56.346
Come on, Ben.

01:22:57.847 --> 01:22:59.599
For the Benchwarmers.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:26.543
Those dirt munchers hit him on purpose.

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:27.460
Rumble!

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.254
-[screaming]
-Rumble!

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:33.133
Come on!

01:23:33.216 --> 01:23:34.175
[screams]

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.271
[screaming]

01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:53.820
[yells]

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:56.781
Come on, Dad, get up!

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.667
The ball's live!

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:10.795
It's a live ball, you morons!

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:22.849
[groaning]

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:25.185
[laughs]

01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:26.436
Come on, Dad, keep going!

01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:30.398
Out of my way! Get out--

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.821
Whoo!

01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:44.871
[groans]

01:24:46.372 --> 01:24:47.332
[laughing]

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:51.878
Yeah, ha, ha, ha!

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.256
No, you don't.

01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:01.096
[yells]

01:25:02.138 --> 01:25:03.431
[groans]

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:11.231
Safe!

01:25:11.397 --> 01:25:12.857
[cheering]

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:16.194
Dad!

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:31.626
You want some of this!

01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:33.795
-Yee-haw!
-Whoo-hoo!

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.761
This is fantastic, eh?

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:43.513
What do you call it again?

01:25:43.763 --> 01:25:44.722
Water.

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:51.396
Somebody just kill me now.

01:25:51.604 --> 01:25:53.231
[all] Yeah!

01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:57.569
Look, guys,
Milford had her baby.

01:25:57.735 --> 01:25:59.487
It's a boy!

01:25:59.779 --> 01:26:02.574
I named him Jeff
after his dead dad.

01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:05.702
He is so adorable.

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:08.538
[all] Aw.

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:16.004
Don't you just love a happy ending?

01:26:16.754 --> 01:26:20.592
Say, I wonder what schmuck ended
up getting the sewage plant.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:32.228
No!

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.211
Guys, I think I'm finally
on to something

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:40.046
regarding your friend, Castenari.

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:42.048
Guys?

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:44.342
Guys?
