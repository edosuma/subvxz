WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:03.586
Previously on Justified...

00:04.088 --> 00:05.922
The US Attorney's gonna
have a lot of questions.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.675
David Vasquez.
I'm looking into your shootings.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.719
Well, should we just do us
a shot of Jim Beam,

00:11.804 --> 00:13.429
just for old times' sake?

00:13.514 --> 00:14.514
Ava!

00:19.603 --> 00:21.604
I ran into that Johnny Crowder the other day.

00:21.689 --> 00:25.858
Bo Crowder's getting out of prison soon.
And Ava killed his son.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.486
Johnny thought you might want
to get out of Kentucky.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.279
It will take more than that to get me gone.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.329
The tape is on your right.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.872
Whereabouts?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.666
Sorry, sweetheart. My right.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.212
Here we go.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.632
See, duct, hot melt, masking, filament.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.261
Where's the plain old
American packing tape?

00:53.345 --> 00:56.055
Check that cardboard box on the end.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.683
- Okay.
- Yeah, that's... That's it.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.143
Right down there.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.395
Mike, raise your eyes.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.646
Mike!

01:05.232 --> 01:06.774
- Mike?
- Yeah.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.569
Hey, Ava.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.363
Hey, I got a shopping list
sent to me by Bo Crowder.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.614
He's getting out real soon,

01:13.699 --> 01:15.700
wants to do a little bit of deer hunting
when he gets back.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.120
I left the list at home,
but I think I can remember it.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.498
Yeah, he... He wants a good length of rope,
maybe nylon,

01:22.583 --> 01:25.334
whatever's good at holding a knot
in case he has to tie that deer up.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.754
He doesn't want that deer to break free.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.006
And some of this duct tape,

01:30.090 --> 01:33.259
the super sticky kind,
real hard to peel off, you know?

01:33.343 --> 01:36.053
Some plastic sheeting,

01:36.138 --> 01:38.681
yeah, you know,
just enough to line the trunk of his Buick,

01:38.766 --> 01:41.851
you know, in case it gets messy.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.519
Shovel. Yeah, that's right, a shovel.

01:43.604 --> 01:47.732
Real sturdy, good enough
to dig a nice big hole in rocky ground.

01:48.817 --> 01:52.403
And there was something else.
Shit if I can't remember.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.364
Oh, yeah, a chainsaw.

02:00.496 --> 02:03.873
Mike, you fill that order for Bo
and put it on my tab.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.334
You can send it to my address in Lexington.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.211
You can pass that address on to Bo,
you know,

02:08.294 --> 02:11.214
if he wants to send a thank-you note.

02:11.590 --> 02:15.968
Well, that's mighty thoughtful of you, Ava.
And if you don't mind one more thing.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.970
Mike, go ahead
and throw in a map of Kentucky.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.682
Yeah. Yeah, the deer that Bo's hunting,
it's open season

02:21.767 --> 02:23.684
wherever the bluegrass grows,

02:23.769 --> 02:26.813
but he might not pursue it
past the state line.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.774
Mike, I need you to check my trigger.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.567
Sometimes it just goes off on its own.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.945
Shit, Helen. Come on, now.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.280
Helen, maybe you could point that gun
somewhere else?

02:36.365 --> 02:38.074
Of course.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.619
Goodbye, Johnny.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.166
Hey, tell Raylan I said, "Hey."

03:02.057 --> 03:03.432
Hello?

03:03.767 --> 03:04.934
Ava.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.227
Raylan?

03:07.062 --> 03:08.604
I'm upstairs.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.747
They're Bowman's.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.878
You never asked me much about Bowman.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.923
I figure you told me what you wanted to.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.053
Don't you wanna know
the question everyone always asks?

03:41.138 --> 03:43.306
"Why didn't you leave him?"

03:45.267 --> 03:48.895
I did. I went to Corbin
and worked at the Holiday Inn.

03:50.147 --> 03:54.066
"Why'd you take him back?"
'Cause he said he was sorry.

03:54.151 --> 03:58.154
"Why'd you believe him?"
Because I wanted to.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.741
The thing people don't understand,
it's not like he beat me around the clock.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.493
I mean, sometimes he was sweet.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.954
At least he tried to be.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.754
You know, he thought I liked these.

04:14.838 --> 04:18.007
I must have seen one at someone's house
and said, "I like that,"

04:18.132 --> 04:20.760
you know, just being polite,
but he thought I really liked them,

04:20.844 --> 04:22.178
so he got them for me.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.306
And I never had the heart
to tell him otherwise.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.603
So, there was a light side to Bowman.

04:34.191 --> 04:37.026
And I told you about the dark side.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.780
So, here I am, going back and forth
between light and dark.

04:42.199 --> 04:46.619
Between wanting to sell this house
and wanting to burn it to the ground.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.830
I got probation.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.294
You know, I can't leave Kentucky,

04:55.671 --> 05:00.174
but I don't have to wear an anklet,
so basically it's just a slap on the wrist.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.468
That make it okay,

05:02.552 --> 05:03.970
what I did?

05:04.554 --> 05:08.474
I mean, I drink enough,
I can tell myself it's no big deal.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.144
But killing a man, it's a big deal, isn't it?

06:34.978 --> 06:39.815
I'm gonna have to get a new bed.
Unless I keep this as a conversation piece.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.904
You planning on having a lot of folks
up here for conversation?

06:44.988 --> 06:46.947
Thanks for being here.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.657
My pleasure.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.495
You were right!

06:53.705 --> 06:56.707
You got him. Or a piece of him, anyway.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.501
There's blood on the grass,

06:58.627 --> 07:01.212
more than you'd get
from flying out a window.

07:01.338 --> 07:04.840
Trail leads up to the road.
Did you see a truck?

07:05.175 --> 07:06.383
I just heard.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.220
By the time I got down there,
all I saw were taillights.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.640
Yeah, well, I'll have the crime-scene guy
run the tire tracks,

07:12.724 --> 07:15.559
but old pickup trucks in Harlan
are just like assholes.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.019
Everyone's got one.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.021
Same goes for these sawed-off shotguns.

07:19.147 --> 07:23.150
Johnny Crowder threatened you
in the hardware store?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.402
It was veiled and all, but, yeah.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.071
Well, I think I'm gonna go talk to him.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.364
It wasn't him.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.157
And you know this how?

07:30.408 --> 07:33.035
Same way I'd know if it was you.
I know Johnny.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.663
I played ball with him for years.
So did you. It wasn't him.

07:35.747 --> 07:39.750
Well, far be it from me to second-guess
those acute powers of observations

07:39.876 --> 07:43.546
of yours, but you were rolling around
on the floor here, fighting for your life.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.673
I'm going out to county line.
I'm gonna check it out.

07:45.757 --> 07:48.676
All right. I'd like to come with you.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.386
Don't you want to stay here with Ava?

07:50.512 --> 07:53.180
She can go to the sheriff's station.
She'll be safe there, right?

08:02.399 --> 08:04.150
I'm glad we're going over there together.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.403
I might need you to stop me
from doing something stupid.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.323
I'm not too popular with the Crowders.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.741
Think I am?

08:13.952 --> 08:17.037
You know, I put Bo away five years ago.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.747
He was running drugs up through Harlan.

08:18.874 --> 08:23.127
Wasn't selling, more of a conduit
for shit flowing up from the South.

08:23.753 --> 08:27.715
But my problem with the Crowders
started a while before that.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.010
You remember Henry Crowder?

08:31.094 --> 08:34.096
He drove the Bookmobile around
to all the schools.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.100
Great guy, sweet guy.
The one good Crowder.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.977
Yeah.

08:41.770 --> 08:46.150
Until one day, eight years ago,
he picked up a 10-year-old little girl,

08:46.276 --> 08:50.779
drove her over to Pine Mountain Forest,

08:52.324 --> 08:54.366
- tied her up...
- No.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.744
...raped her, strangled her.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.123
Charlotte Rose Thomas. My niece.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.005
Well, I can't imagine
anything worse than that.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.468
She'd be finishing high school about now.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.472
You put Henry away?

09:18.642 --> 09:23.187
I spent years searching high and low.
Never found him.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.273
But I rode them Crowders hard.

09:26.483 --> 09:30.527
Some folks say that's why I put Bo away
for his drug running.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.030
As opposed to you actually doing your job.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.531
Exactly.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.539
Did make a contribution, though.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.009
Oh, shit.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.428
Johnny.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.265
Hey! Raylan Givens in the house.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.352
And looky here.
He brought his little cop buddy.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.020
Get your clothes off, Johnny.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.605
Pardon?

10:06.690 --> 10:07.898
Well, I know you speak English.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.609
I believe it's one of your
proudest achievements.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.194
Take your clothes off.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.531
You finally coming out as a gay man?
Shit. Good for you.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.741
Somebody took a shot at Ava tonight.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.830
Old Raylan here put one in him.
I want to make sure it ain't you.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.206
Get your clothes off.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.167
Well, I will if you will.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.254
Get your clothes off!

10:30.338 --> 10:32.256
All right, Johnny, listen to him.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.841
You can arrest me if you want,

10:33.925 --> 10:35.676
but it might not go
as smooth as you hope it would.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.094
- I'll show you how smooth!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:37.178 --> 10:39.638
- Bring it on!
- Whoa! Hey! Hey!

10:41.099 --> 10:43.642
This does not have to go sideways!

10:43.727 --> 10:45.185
I know it wasn't you.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.730
If it was, I figure you'd be in a world of pain.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.066
- Maybe you just grazed him.
- I hit meat. I heard the man howl.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.244
Jesus, Raylan! Get off me! Don't touch me!

11:02.329 --> 11:03.912
You're gonna do this here
in my place of business?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.623
- What are you doing? Let me go!
- Well, are you satisfied?

11:06.708 --> 11:09.084
- I want to see his ass.
- Shit!

11:10.086 --> 11:12.254
Get off me, faggot!

11:12.339 --> 11:13.922
Sheriff's just doing his job.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.258
- Shit!
- I'll be damned.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.513
- Well?
- You're right. It wasn't him.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.227
Shit!

11:28.229 --> 11:29.730
We know you're threatening Ava, boy.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
That's true, Johnny.
You're gonna have to answer for that.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.277
And don't say it was about deer hunting.
That ain't gonna fly.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.446
I only did it for her own good.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.741
I mean, shit, Raylan.
Come on, Ava's a beauty.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.910
I always wanted to bed her myself.

11:42.994 --> 11:46.538
I just said what I said because
I didn't want a pretty girl like that to get hurt.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.540
Are you sure you ain't gay?

11:48.625 --> 11:51.210
Did any other Crowders order a hit on her?

11:51.294 --> 11:53.295
By "any other Crowders," you mean Bo?

11:53.380 --> 11:56.757
Who's still in prison, by the way, as I'm sure
Mr. Big Boy here's been bragging about.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.759
- That's right.
- He could get the word out.

11:59.928 --> 12:03.389
Well, if he did, I didn't hear about it.
I heard nothing.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.558
- He doesn't tell me that shit anymore.
- All right.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.936
- 'Cause I am the business owner.
- All right.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.479
I'm the respectable one!

12:10.563 --> 12:11.980
Hey, man. How's Kentucky?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.690
You know,
I've been thinking more about the book,

12:13.775 --> 12:14.942
how it should be organized.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.819
Yeah, yeah, write everything down.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.447
Each chapter should be one of my rules.
Keep it to 10, like a top-10 list.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.574
Yeah. Yeah, I like that. You know, I like that.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.829
If it becomes a bestseller,
I could do another one. More Rules.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.915
Hey, I could write a book, Rules of Being Hit.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.127
Like... Like,
if you get tapped for special handling,

12:33.211 --> 12:34.837
don't try and tough it out.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.006
You want to cry and scream
as much as you can.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.926
It puts on a better show for the client,
and it's over quicker.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.095
- That's right, right.
- Yeah.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.763
That'll be the one that gets you in with Gio.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.432
Hey, shut up.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.642
I told them to keep you inside.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.602
I started smoking, and they kicked me out.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.439
Besides, no Crowder's gonna do anything
in broad daylight.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.648
I got to go.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.444
They hired some local idiot as a spotter,
and he got himself shot.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.904
Now I got to go freaking clean it up.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.699
I'll see if they found out something.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.411
- You find Johnny?
- Yeah. It wasn't him.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.456
Says he doesn't know who it was.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.748
You believe him?

13:12.417 --> 13:13.542
I do.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.086
He says he was just warning you
because he likes you.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.754
How sweet.

13:17.839 --> 13:22.468
I guess talking about plastic-lined trunks
and chainsaws is kind of flirty.

13:23.386 --> 13:26.013
They called around to all the hospitals
and clinics within 100 miles,

13:26.097 --> 13:27.264
no gunshot victims.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.267
Probably holed up in a cabin in a holler,
licking his wounds.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.228
I guess I'll start looking at the cabins
around here.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.646
What you gonna do?

13:34.731 --> 13:39.151
Well, as soon as she finishes her cigarette,
I'm gonna get Ava the hell out of Harlan.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.392
What was that sound?

14:13.728 --> 14:18.315
I'm so sorry. I screwed up. I know I did.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.275
I know I did.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.570
Man. You should see yourself.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.000
Did you just piss yourself?

14:38.419 --> 14:43.048
Please don't... Don't kill me.
Please don't kill me. Please don't kill...

14:43.967 --> 14:45.300
Please don't...

14:52.642 --> 14:54.309
Hey, hey, hey.

14:55.270 --> 14:59.690
You're gonna want to do
something about that before it gets infected.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.997
Hello, Rachel.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.207
Don't suppose it's a coincidence,
you standing there?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.750
What do you think?

15:18.835 --> 15:21.461
Ms. Crowder, you're coming with me.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.483
Don't sit down.

15:49.198 --> 15:53.410
Just what part of being under investigation
confuses you, Raylan?

15:53.995 --> 15:56.204
So many things confuse me, Art.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.416
Do you think we're gonna banter here?
Because we're not.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.085
- Where's Rachel putting Ava?
- On a bench.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.962
She's in security now, so she's safe.

16:04.047 --> 16:07.424
And if anybody asks her, she'll just say
that she's come to see her lawyer.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.344
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.888
'Cause if somebody asks,
it means they're suspicious.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.265
Hell, I'm wondering myself!

16:15.350 --> 16:17.142
Let me see if I can get this straight!

16:17.226 --> 16:19.978
You shot somebody else? At her house?

16:20.313 --> 16:23.690
He broke in. He took a shot at...
He almost killed her, for God's sakes.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.110
Where'd you pop it off this time?
In her bedroom?

16:30.239 --> 16:33.909
Well, Vasquez is gonna have a field day
with this one, isn't he?

16:35.286 --> 16:38.914
Just what in God's name
do you expect me to do, Raylan?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.375
I tell you to do one simple thing,

16:41.459 --> 16:44.461
refrain from screwing the witness
in your own shooting,

16:44.545 --> 16:46.672
and you can't even do that!

16:46.756 --> 16:49.424
You think there's never gonna be
any consequences for this?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.885
Just because we taught shooting together
at Glynco?

16:51.969 --> 16:54.638
Whoa, whoa, if you want to transfer me,
by all means, be my guest.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.265
Don't... Did I say I wanted to transfer you?

17:16.118 --> 17:20.747
If you think Ava's eligible,
call a US Attorney and put her in WitSec.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.416
She ain't eligible, Art.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.087
Even if she was, she wouldn't go.

17:27.505 --> 17:31.299
Well, what are your options?
What are you gonna do?

17:32.301 --> 17:34.928
You just gonna stay by her side
for the rest of your life?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.360
Hello, Hunter. Find the shooter?

17:50.445 --> 17:53.447
Not yet. But we only checked
the cabins closest to town

17:53.906 --> 17:56.324
and you know what they say
about backwoods cabins in Harlan.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.411
They're like assholes, pickups,
and sawed-off shotguns.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.662
Where are you?

18:00.747 --> 18:03.373
- On my way to Big Sandy.
- You gonna talk to Bo?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.250
Figure I'd start with Boyd.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.711
Well, I could go with you
if you want to meet up along the way.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.921
No, it's best I talk to him alone.

18:10.006 --> 18:14.176
Well, suit yourself, then.
Hey, is Ava with you?

18:14.719 --> 18:15.886
No.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.138
I just wanted to make sure
you got her somewhere safe,

18:18.222 --> 18:19.973
which of course you did.
That's stupid of me.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.349
I did.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.435
Well, all righty, then.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.786
Ava Crowder?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.329
You look real familiar.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.957
Yeah. I was taking notes when
you started your interview with the AUSA.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.876
I remember you. You got up and left.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.169
Must have been something I said.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.923
No, I got up because...
I left because I had a conflict.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.216
I'm Raylan's ex-wife.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.262
Did you know Raylan growing up in Harlan?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.555
- I did.
- Okay.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.100
First time I saw him, going on 20 years,
is when he showed up at my house,

19:04.185 --> 19:05.477
looking for Boyd Crowder.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.438
And that was after you shot your husband?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.191
That's right.

19:11.526 --> 19:14.486
Seems like you know a lot about me.
I don't even know your name.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.863
I'm sorry. It's Winona.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.532
Winona Hawkins now.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.492
So, what brings you to Lexington?

19:22.078 --> 19:24.120
I'm meeting my lawyer.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.832
I thought they were handling your case
down in Harlan?

19:26.916 --> 19:28.625
Are you a lawyer yourself, Winona?

19:29.877 --> 19:34.506
Because I'm asking so many questions?
No. That's just me being rude.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.759
I guess it comes from all those years
being married to a Leo.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.097
You know what that...
It's law enforcement officer.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.893
You ever been tangled up
with a law enforcement officer?

19:48.312 --> 19:50.188
Yeah, well, it has its challenges.

19:50.273 --> 19:53.024
Like, when you go out to eat,
he always has to sit facing the door.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.862
He'll run all kinds
of worst-case scenarios like,

19:56.946 --> 19:59.948
"What do you do if somebody's chasing you
through a parking garage?"

20:00.032 --> 20:02.409
Or, "What do you do
if you crash your car into a lake?"

20:02.493 --> 20:04.369
Stuff like that.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.456
The worst part is when he's at work
and the phone rings,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.917
and you dread picking it up, thinking...

20:12.044 --> 20:15.964
Well, you know, if anything, my husband
was on the other side of the equation.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.010
Why on Earth am I telling you all this?

20:20.094 --> 20:21.428
You must have your reasons.

20:21.512 --> 20:24.389
I can't for the life of me
imagine what they are.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.225
Ava, sorry to interrupt you.

20:27.518 --> 20:31.271
Sheriff Hunter, guess who this is.
This is the former Mrs. Givens.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.857
It's Winona, right, like the actress?

20:34.775 --> 20:36.776
Hunter Mosley, Harlan County Sheriff.
Nice to meet you.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.403
- It's nice to meet you.
- I know your ex.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.863
He's one of the good ones.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.197
Yeah, that's what he kept telling me.

20:41.824 --> 20:45.619
Speaking of which, I just spoke with Raylan.
He thinks you should come with me.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.203
Okay.

20:48.039 --> 20:52.417
There was an incident at my house in Harlan.
It's a long story. Maybe I'll see you again.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.170
You're not gonna stay
and meet with your lawyer?

20:55.588 --> 20:59.716
Thanks for reminding me. Maybe I'll call.
Take care now.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.092
Bye.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.407
Well, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Raylan,

21:24.492 --> 21:26.701
but you know how these places can be.

21:26.786 --> 21:31.665
So many gates and sally ports
and highly invasive searches.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.417
What brings you to my house?

21:35.252 --> 21:37.003
This is your house now, huh?

21:37.505 --> 21:40.465
Why, yes, prison is my home,
if that's what you're asking, Raylan.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.217
This is where God needs me to be.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.260
- Now, how can I...
- All right. Boyd, I don't mean to be rude,

21:44.345 --> 21:46.346
but I didn't come to hear you preach,

21:46.430 --> 21:48.515
and I don't want to hear
about my daddy, neither.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.935
- Well, what can I do for you, Raylan?
- I need a reason

21:52.019 --> 21:56.690
to not bring the full weight of every
available resource I can muster

21:56.774 --> 22:00.402
down on the heads of you and your father
and every Crowder

22:00.486 --> 22:03.530
housed in this
or any other federal penitentiary.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.281
Well, who lit your fuse?

22:05.366 --> 22:06.700
Do not feign ignorance.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.368
Well, I am surely not.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.913
You don't know anything
about somebody taking a shot at Ava?

22:12.206 --> 22:15.083
What? Well, when did this happen?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.292
You tell me.

22:17.712 --> 22:21.423
Well, you think that I would do that,
knowing me as well as you do?

22:21.507 --> 22:24.592
Do I think you ordered it? No.

22:25.136 --> 22:28.930
I figure if you wanted that done,
you had plenty of opportunities.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.640
You think my daddy did?

22:30.725 --> 22:32.600
He's got the reason and the inclination.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.771
Why, yes, he does, but I can assure you
that he did not do this.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.148
You know this how?

22:38.232 --> 22:41.359
Well, I spoke to him the other day
about Ava.

22:41.444 --> 22:44.571
And I told him that there was no peace
in an act of revenge,

22:44.655 --> 22:46.406
but God was the comfort he seeks.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.574
Stop it.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.910
For in the Bible it says, Romans 12,

22:50.995 --> 22:54.080
"Beloved, never avenge yourselves,
but leave it to the wrath of God."

23:02.923 --> 23:04.299
Hey. Hey.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.803
Well, I'm so very disappointed in you,
Raylan.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.727
I'm one of the best hunting men
in this county.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.563
I've got the right instincts to be a hit man.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.065
If you had the right instincts,

23:20.149 --> 23:22.650
you wouldn't be sitting here
with a hole in your shoulder.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.946
You were supposed to spot.
That's it. That's all you had to do.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.741
- I screwed up.
- Got that right.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.245
Did you start off as a spotter?

23:34.455 --> 23:38.416
What? You think there's a hit man guild?

23:38.959 --> 23:41.211
You apprentice
and rise up through the ranks?

23:41.462 --> 23:44.881
I don't know.
Hey, what's your favorite weapon?

23:47.384 --> 23:48.885
Sawed-off.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.137
It's short, so it's got a quick pull.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.766
Of course it's got a wide scatter,
so it's only good inside 10 feet.

23:54.850 --> 23:58.645
But the big selling point is
they can't match it,

23:58.729 --> 24:01.439
no matter what they tell you on the CSI.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.692
Sawed-off's what I used.

24:05.236 --> 24:08.488
But not very well, huh?
You broke rule number nine.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.574
You're supposed to let them come to you.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.202
You don't burst through the door.
You lie in wait!

24:15.538 --> 24:17.997
See, there's rules to being a hit man.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.917
What are the other rules?

24:22.253 --> 24:24.170
You'll have to buy the book.

24:36.350 --> 24:39.352
You think you can behave yourself
this time?

25:01.417 --> 25:04.210
Anyway, you were saying?

25:04.295 --> 25:08.840
Well, I wanted to assure you that my father
played no hand in this shooting.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.050
And I spoke to him the other day about Ava,

25:11.135 --> 25:13.720
and he assured me
that he would give her a pass,

25:13.804 --> 25:15.180
at least until he got out.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.890
However, if he saw her in Harlan,

25:16.974 --> 25:20.685
he could not guarantee
that he wouldn't change his mind.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.897
Now, he'd have no reason to lie to me,
Raylan. He never has before.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.236
You're so very disturbed, my friend.
Let me ask you something.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.573
Where was this shot fired?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.366
In her house.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.702
But where in the house?
Was it in the kitchen?

25:37.786 --> 25:39.621
In the living room? Was it in the bedroom?

25:40.706 --> 25:41.873
Why do you want to know that?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.750
Humor me.
I think I might be onto something.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.296
It was in the bedroom. Why?

25:49.298 --> 25:51.674
Now, was Ava alone
at the time of the shooting,

25:51.759 --> 25:54.177
or was she keeping company with someone?

25:54.470 --> 25:55.678
Where are you going with this?

25:56.013 --> 25:57.597
Was that company you, Raylan?

25:57.806 --> 26:00.308
All right. Thank you.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.853
Hold on. Give me 30 seconds.
I'm not trying to pry.

26:03.938 --> 26:07.815
I am honestly trying to help you out.
Now, sit down.

26:14.281 --> 26:18.201
Now, I know what it was like for you
growing up in that household,

26:18.285 --> 26:20.245
having to watch your daddy
rough up your mama.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.372
Oh, dear Lord. We're not talking
about my father again, are we?

26:22.456 --> 26:24.457
I can only imagine what it must have
been like as a little boy

26:24.541 --> 26:26.417
having to see something like that.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.962
Not being able to do anything about it.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.339
Well, I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if that's not a big reason

26:31.423 --> 26:33.591
why you got your gold star and your gun.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.677
- You know, I'm not an idiot.
- I would think that you vowed...

26:35.761 --> 26:38.596
I'm not completely unaware
of my motivations in life.

26:38.681 --> 26:44.352
What I think that you might be unaware of
is how powerful such a motivation can be.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.188
Powerful enough to cloud your vision...

26:47.273 --> 26:49.816
- Are you even in the vicinity of a point?
...cloud your judgment.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.026
I'm closing in, I promise.

26:52.653 --> 26:57.991
Now, you're laying in Ava's bed next to her,
and someone takes a shot.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.576
Now, given Ava's bad blood with my family,

27:00.661 --> 27:02.453
why, naturally,
you would assume it was a Crowder,

27:02.538 --> 27:07.000
but what if it was the assumption
before that one that was erroneous?

27:07.626 --> 27:08.918
What assumption was that?

27:09.003 --> 27:10.253
What if Ava wasn't the intended?

27:12.298 --> 27:16.467
Now, given all the enemies
you've made over all these many years,

27:16.552 --> 27:19.429
what if that shooter was gunning for you?

27:36.113 --> 27:38.031
- Yeah?
- Open up!

27:38.115 --> 27:40.867
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

27:40.951 --> 27:43.077
County Sheriff! Open up!

27:52.212 --> 27:54.005
What in the...

27:59.136 --> 28:01.012
Did somebody piss on my rug?

28:01.472 --> 28:02.847
Sorry.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.601
Hey, do you mind?

28:06.685 --> 28:09.187
Put yours in your holster.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.112
Sit down, Red.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.200
- Where is he?
- Right now?

28:22.284 --> 28:24.077
- Yeah.
- At Big Sandy,

28:24.161 --> 28:25.787
then headed back to Lexington.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.664
But don't worry, we can help you find him.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.376
How hard can it be to find him?
He's a US Marshal.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.461
- He works at the Federal Courthouse.
- Yeah.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.546
We can find out where he lives.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.507
Miami can get that information.

28:37.591 --> 28:41.844
Well, we can set him up,
so you can put him down at a distance.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.138
I don't want to put him down at a distance.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.766
I have very specific orders,
and I'll do what I'm paid to do,

28:46.850 --> 28:48.059
a lesson you should've learned!

28:48.143 --> 28:51.020
Hey, hey, hey.
Red here was just eager, that's all.

28:52.189 --> 28:55.900
All I know is,
if he'd have just done as he was told,

28:55.984 --> 28:59.153
there'd be parts of Raylan Givens
in five counties.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.948
There'd be a videotape on the mail
on the way to Miami,

29:02.032 --> 29:04.659
and I'd be on a plane back to Texas.

29:05.119 --> 29:10.039
Mr. Duke, if you want to go,
then, by all means, go.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.834
Jesus Christ!

29:16.422 --> 29:19.048
- God damn!
- I called Miami.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.678
He had clearance to tie up any loose ends.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.305
You're definitely a loose end.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.933
You killed him to save me?

29:29.017 --> 29:32.270
No, dipshit! Obviously, I'm a loose end, too!

29:33.355 --> 29:35.857
Well, Miami's gonna be okay
with you killing him?

29:35.941 --> 29:40.069
No, they're not gonna be okay,
but it was the only play I had.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.946
Is this all his stuff?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.991
He was gonna torture him, take video.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.785
Said he was writing a book
about being a hit man.

29:47.870 --> 29:51.372
Yeah, well, we know
how that book ends now, don't we?

29:55.002 --> 29:56.919
Whoa. Damn!

29:57.629 --> 30:00.214
When did you get the van out there?

30:01.133 --> 30:02.842
Van!

30:02.926 --> 30:05.428
I traded the truck for it?

30:05.512 --> 30:07.054
Paper trail?

30:07.431 --> 30:10.683
No. Why? We gonna run?

30:13.479 --> 30:17.064
Ain't nowhere you can hide
they ain't gonna get you eventually.

30:18.942 --> 30:22.111
The same cartel waited five years
to get a money launderer they were after.

30:22.196 --> 30:26.741
Raylan was after him, too. Guess what?
Cartel got him first.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.242
Then, what are we gonna do?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.119
We need a show of good faith.

30:31.205 --> 30:32.788
We need to give them what they want.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.582
What do they want?

30:34.666 --> 30:37.126
Well, they want rainbows and unicorns.

30:37.211 --> 30:39.337
God damn it, Red! Catch up!

30:39.922 --> 30:41.756
What do you think they want?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.134
They want Raylan Givens.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.765
- It's Raylan.
- Raylan.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.017
You talk to Boyd?

30:53.185 --> 30:57.438
I did. He said the second I saw you,
I should shoot you in the face.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.067
Well, I'm guessing
you don't want me to waste time

31:01.151 --> 31:03.027
pretending I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.530
You wasted enough time just then.

31:07.824 --> 31:08.950
You know I got Ava?

31:09.993 --> 31:11.327
Pay careful attention now,

31:11.954 --> 31:13.371
or she dies.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.478
You understand the situation?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.063
You draw on me,

31:39.147 --> 31:42.733
I don't care if you're Deadeye Dick
and put one right through my brain stem

31:42.818 --> 31:46.320
before I hit the ground,
Red will blow a hole in Ava's skull.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.077
Got your cell on,
transmitting to your friends?

31:54.705 --> 31:58.040
You were once in law enforcement.
What do you think?

32:00.669 --> 32:02.336
If you want to repeat what I said about Ava...

32:02.421 --> 32:04.338
I'm sure they got it.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.050
You honestly see a way out of this?

32:09.678 --> 32:13.180
Well, you mean
like one of those police chases on TV?

32:13.849 --> 32:16.392
Helicopter following some dipshit
through the streets?

32:16.518 --> 32:19.729
You know, when that idiot finally crashes,
you ever notice how many get out and run?

32:20.188 --> 32:23.941
If you're like me, you're yelling at the TV,
"What the hell you running for, asshole?

32:24.026 --> 32:27.570
"We gonna get you!"
And we always do, right?

32:30.032 --> 32:32.867
Except we don't, really.
You know that. Not always.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.412
They just don't show the ones
that get away on TV.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.414
You're gonna be
one of the lucky ones, huh?

32:40.208 --> 32:45.212
If I've got a one-in-a-hundred...
Hell, if I've got a one-in-a-million shot,

32:45.464 --> 32:47.381
I'm gonna take it.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.552
The gun's in the trunk.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.304
Let me see Ava.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.514
Well, you're gonna have to take
my word on that.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.475
- Come on.
- Well, I'd like to.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.894
But your boy Red, that's his name, right?

33:00.228 --> 33:02.396
He's already shown he's incompetent.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.690
For all I know,
he was trying to put a gag on her,

33:04.775 --> 33:06.817
- accidentally choked her to death.
- She's alive and well.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.904
Well, good.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.158
That's good.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.285
Red!

33:20.791 --> 33:22.333
That's enough!

33:28.924 --> 33:33.260
Put your guns, plural, into the trunk.
Get in the driver's seat.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.295
Give me your cell phone.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.177
Listen up, US Marshals. Situation's changed.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.556
You try to take out my associate
while he's driving the van,

34:18.639 --> 34:20.599
I blow a hole in Raylan's head.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.643
You get within shooting distance behind us,

34:23.353 --> 34:27.063
I blow Raylan's head off.
You see a theme developing?

34:34.364 --> 34:35.572
Follow him.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.839
Harlan's finest.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.841
We can't all be Marshals.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.761
You signed up for Sheriff's
when you couldn't make the cut?

34:56.844 --> 34:58.512
I was being sarcastic.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.225
No, I never wanted to run off
and join the federal circus.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.229
There's plenty that needs to be done
around Harlan.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.274
You remember little Charlotte Rose?

35:10.358 --> 35:12.902
Sad story. You gonna tell it again?

35:13.862 --> 35:16.947
Sad story, all right.
It's got a different ending.

35:17.240 --> 35:22.036
Let me guess. The boys from Miami
or their Dixie Mafia friends

35:22.120 --> 35:25.372
offered to find Henry Crowder for you
in return for a favor.

35:26.041 --> 35:29.293
The day they delivered Henry to me
was a happy day.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.213
And with your sheriff's paycheck,

35:32.297 --> 35:34.882
I bet you didn't have the money
they wanted in return.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.384
So you got Bo
out of the drug-running business

35:37.469 --> 35:39.804
and took over the Harlan franchise yourself.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.473
It's what they wanted all along.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.892
Bo was squeezing them,

35:45.018 --> 35:47.102
and I offered the same service
at a fraction of the price.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.729
Business 101.

35:51.399 --> 35:55.277
I know this is gonna sound weird,
maybe even a little creepy,

35:56.196 --> 35:58.239
but there ain't a bachelor alive in Harlan...

35:58.365 --> 36:01.492
Well, hell, hell,
throw in most of the married men, too.

36:01.576 --> 36:05.412
Not a man whose heart didn't lift
when he heard that you were single again.

36:05.914 --> 36:09.458
There ain't a straight man alive in Harlan
didn't have a crush on you.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.670
When they order you to pop me?

36:12.754 --> 36:15.881
They didn't come to me on that.
They sent a button man.

36:17.217 --> 36:20.094
Trouble was, he didn't know
his way around our mountains,

36:20.220 --> 36:22.847
so Miami asked me
to get someone to spot for him.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.974
You know, that button man
was supposed to get you alone

36:25.100 --> 36:29.311
and video the old ordeal
so the boys in Miami could watch you squeal

36:29.437 --> 36:35.109
while drinking rum
and eating cheese popcorn, I don't know.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.486
Don't you worry. I took care of him.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.281
I popped him so quick
he didn't even know what hit him.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.284
Yeah. Yeah, before he killed you, huh?

36:43.785 --> 36:46.620
On account of your friend Red
screwing the pooch.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.915
Yeah.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.795
So the cartel wants me dead that bad, huh?

36:55.463 --> 36:57.798
I suppose they got a helicopter
coming for you, though, huh?

36:59.467 --> 37:02.469
What, are you gonna offer me
witness protection now, Raylan?

37:02.596 --> 37:04.471
We could call the US Attorney right now.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.641
Well, I thought of that already.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.768
But when he hears what I got to offer,

37:09.853 --> 37:13.647
which is, what, no names
and a couple of cell phone numbers

37:13.773 --> 37:16.317
probably don't belong to anyone,
I think he'd likely pass.

37:18.153 --> 37:23.157
Well, I guess there's only about one thing
left for you to do.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.619
- Yeah, what's that?
- Pray.

37:33.335 --> 37:36.378
You know, I had all my dreams
and my fantasies,

37:36.504 --> 37:37.963
you know, like...

37:38.048 --> 37:41.508
But I honestly never imagined
we'd be going off alone like this.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.054
What are you doing?

37:51.978 --> 37:53.479
Hey, hey, don't lose them.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.856
Come on, put your foot on it! Just keep up!

38:16.878 --> 38:18.128
No! No, no, no, no!

38:18.213 --> 38:19.922
The only place you're running
is towards that van.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.049
You broke my wrist.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.677
Ava! Ava!

38:26.763 --> 38:27.888
Sit.

38:28.181 --> 38:30.057
Damn it. I said sit!

38:30.600 --> 38:32.059
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.020
Cuff yourself.
You move, I'll shoot you in the kneecap.

38:35.105 --> 38:36.772
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.482
- I think I got him.
- Shit!

38:38.566 --> 38:40.693
God, did I kill him?

38:42.570 --> 38:44.238
No, he's breathing.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.784
I'm so sorry.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.369
Thank you. Thank you.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.578
For what?

39:03.758 --> 39:09.555
"Receive instructions in wise dealings,
words of insight, graceful righteousness..."

39:09.639 --> 39:12.224
Are you ready
to ask the Lord for forgiveness?

39:12.434 --> 39:15.477
Now, you know that kind of thing
don't interest me, Boyd.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.647
But you know what?
Something Jeb saw got my attention.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.066
Tell him what you saw, Jeb.

39:21.151 --> 39:24.278
I seen you yapping
with that cowboy yesterday.

39:25.113 --> 39:29.908
Now, word is, this ain't the first time
that you've had him on the line.

39:30.952 --> 39:33.287
I'm disappointed in you, Boyd.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.041
You and your bacon
should have got you a private room.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.126
- I don't need one.
- Could have got some conjugal.

39:39.252 --> 39:41.170
I don't need a private room
to spread the good word.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.963
Rest assured that's all I was doing.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.465
You're running your mouth, Boyd.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.386
Look, Corker, you know me better
than to take a simpleton's word over mine.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.222
I don't believe I know you at all, Boyd.

39:52.307 --> 39:57.311
See, the fact is,
I don't associate with rats or snitches.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.521
Used to respect you, Boyd.

39:59.773 --> 40:03.108
Them Crowder commandos
was the shit in my neck of the woods.

40:03.193 --> 40:06.070
You used to be somebody. Not anymore.

40:06.154 --> 40:08.906
Well, I've tapped into a power
greater than you will ever know, my friend.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.200
Stop running that drag
out both sides of your mouth.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.077
And you repent your sins
and beg the Lord for forgiveness.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.328
Wood.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.291
There he is!

40:24.631 --> 40:26.757
- Get him!
- Hold him up!

40:26.841 --> 40:29.009
Hold him! Hold him up!

40:29.344 --> 40:33.472
Well, I might be a man of the cloth,
but I sure as hell ain't no lamb!

40:33.556 --> 40:36.475
You better pray
that you go upstairs and not down.

40:36.810 --> 40:39.228
You know the rule! Get away from him.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.315
Men of God
are not to be touched by anyone.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.525
Snitching!

40:44.651 --> 40:47.361
Now, you don't really have any idea
what he's doing, now, do you?

40:47.445 --> 40:49.029
I know I don't.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.697
Now, listen up.

40:51.366 --> 40:54.868
His heavenly Father will take care of him
when his time comes.

40:55.870 --> 40:59.039
But if his time comes early
on account of any of you,

40:59.374 --> 41:03.544
his father here on Earth is gonna see to it
you are gutted like trout.

41:03.878 --> 41:07.506
But truth is, you're shorting the gate
in a few months.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.384
What do you think's
gonna happen to him then?

41:10.468 --> 41:12.553
Why don't you take a shot and find out?

41:12.679 --> 41:14.471
Don't you push me, Bo Crowder!

41:14.556 --> 41:15.806
Take a shot.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.978
You watch it, old man.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.232
Son, what the hell are you doing?

41:26.401 --> 41:28.694
It's good to see you, Daddy.
