Nothing, it's just...

02:15.678 --> 02:16.679
so sad.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.846
Claire.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.306
We both knew exactly what she was.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.475
Yes, I know,
she was the bitchy side character.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.601
Hm?

02:24.019 --> 02:25.478
Sorry.

[clears throat]

02:27.230 --> 02:28.273
-Go.
-Oh.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.695
But, Seth, suicide?

02:33.112 --> 02:36.824
[Claire] A character like Ga-in,
she would have killed Joon, not herself.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.034
Plus, the exact same way Mr. Park died,

02:39.118 --> 02:40.119
which <i>was</i> a murder.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.745
This isn’t real life, this is a K-drama,

02:41.829 --> 02:45.082
so whoever killed Mr. Park
killed Ga-in, right?

02:47.001 --> 02:48.418
[Seth clears throat]
[Claire] Oh.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.923
This isn't one of those dramas, Claire.

02:53.007 --> 02:56.426
This isn't a mystery, it's romance.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.929
It was supposed to be a romance.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.683
You look really nice, by the way.
All like pressed and clean.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.560
Very, like, manly.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.315
That’s nice of you to say.
[Claire chuckles]

03:10.774 --> 03:12.109
You look very nice yourself.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.822
Well, it is a funeral.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.699
We're sorry for your loss.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.451
[male #1] Thank you for coming.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.585
Now, this isn't real life,
this is a K-Drama,

03:30.668 --> 03:32.796
so whoever did it to Mr. Park and Ga-in,

03:33.047 --> 03:35.632
they'd be here for the memorial.
I mean, they have to be, right?

03:36.674 --> 03:38.426
Extra, extra...

03:38.551 --> 03:40.888
Seo-yeon, no. Mrs. Park... oh, maybe.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.347
-Claire.
-What?

03:42.848 --> 03:45.391
It's not that I don't appreciate
all your sleuthing here,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.102
but I don’t think
this is the time and place.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.896
I don't know what else to do!

03:51.023 --> 03:54.442
- Your boyfriend's not here.
- Joon's not my boyfriend.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.862
Don’t you think that that’s odd
he’s not here?

03:56.945 --> 04:00.157
Don’t you think that that’s,
I don’t know, a little suspicious?

04:02.076 --> 04:07.164
The fiancé of the deceased is the only
recurring character that’s missing?

04:08.373 --> 04:09.707
Hmm...

04:10.209 --> 04:11.210
I don't know.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.506
Where the hell is he?

04:40.030 --> 04:43.700
[chilling music]

04:56.504 --> 04:58.631
Psst! Psst!

04:58.924 --> 05:02.177
Keep this safe! All of North Korea's
atomic missile secrets are inside.

05:02.261 --> 05:05.848
No, no! I can't deal with this right now.
I have my own problems.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.814
[Claire] Hey!

05:15.023 --> 05:16.441
Are you okay?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.028
She and I
were never going to be best friends,

05:20.863 --> 05:23.157
[Seo-yeon] but if I'd known
this was going to happen...

05:24.199 --> 05:28.494
I would have been kinder to her.
I'm so sorry...

05:28.578 --> 05:33.000
[sad music]

05:34.126 --> 05:35.294
[Seth] Shh...

05:35.376 --> 05:36.711
Don't cry, Seo-yeon.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.047
I feel so sorry...

05:39.131 --> 05:41.049
You have no reason to feel that way.

05:41.133 --> 05:47.055
If anyone has a reason to feel guilty,
it's Park Joon for not being here.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.806
Seth!

05:49.016 --> 05:50.225
Not now.

06:13.664 --> 06:17.543
Dad, I'm sorry I never got
a chance to say goodbye.

06:20.588 --> 06:25.344
You, too, Ga-in.
I would have liked to cook for you.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.971
KIMCHI FRIED RICE

06:28.347 --> 06:34.061
Dad, remember how you used to cook for me?

06:39.191 --> 06:44.363
Let's at least share
one last meal together.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.041
- Seth.
- Hm?

06:56.707 --> 07:00.087
I keep asking myself over and over,
who benefited from Mr. Park’s death?

07:00.170 --> 07:03.173
Who benefits from Ga-in’s death?
And there’s only one answer.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.386
What if I was all wrong
and Joon's the murderer?

07:07.718 --> 07:09.595
Joon? The murderer?

07:09.679 --> 07:10.638
Well, think about it.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.474
His father wanted him
to inherit the company. Dead.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.936
Ga-in was trying to force
him to marry her. Dead.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.815
- But he’s the leading man.
- Who else could it possibly be?

07:21.400 --> 07:22.442
Seth!

07:23.068 --> 07:26.113
I don’t have time
for your revenge fantasies.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.073
I’m just trying to save the world.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.158
What about Chapter nine?

07:30.575 --> 07:33.954
- You'll have to refresh my memory.
- Chapter nine! Justice!

07:34.288 --> 07:36.581
In K-Drama, life is fair.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.708
And if evil goes unconfronted
by the end of a series,

07:38.791 --> 07:40.294
it will continue to affect other dramas,

07:40.377 --> 07:42.421
either directly or indirectly.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.589
Well, then, you had better confront him.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.930
Hello, everyone.

07:53.639 --> 07:57.477
My name is Seth, and I am the owner

07:57.602 --> 07:59.854
of the soon-to-open restaurant,
Seth's Libertine.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.732
I wanted to take a moment to thank you all

08:02.815 --> 08:05.360
for coming here to honor our friend,
Ga-in.

08:06.861 --> 08:12.658
I'd just like to say a few words
before we say good-bye forever.

08:13.701 --> 08:19.207
Ga-in played an important
part in all of our lives.

08:21.667 --> 08:26.672
We'll never know what she was thinking
in those last minutes.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.218
The despair she must have felt...

08:30.635 --> 08:32.678
to take her own life...

08:36.266 --> 08:41.146
Let's choose to remember her
at her best, though.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.857
As I'm sure Ga-in herself
would have wished of us.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.030
Rest in peace, Ga-in.

08:57.578 --> 08:58.829
And perhaps now...

08:59.498 --> 09:02.750
we could hear from her fiancé?

09:04.336 --> 09:06.213
Park Joon, are you here?

09:20.143 --> 09:21.727
That son of a bitch.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.314
Dad...

09:24.939 --> 09:26.233
Ga-in...

09:28.443 --> 09:35.325
I've been trying to remember
my happiest memories with each of you,

09:36.993 --> 09:42.416
but no matter how much I try,
I seem to come up blank.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.171
My only wish right now is...

09:50.507 --> 09:52.134
I know it sounds crazy...

09:54.635 --> 09:57.556
but I wish I was able to stop time.

09:58.348 --> 10:03.395
Then I'd go back in time to those
happy moments and relive them with you.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.112
But it's all over and done with.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.241
No second chances.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.785
Everything's gone.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.751
All gone!

10:43.976 --> 10:45.936
What the hell do you want?

10:46.438 --> 10:47.730
Justice.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.402
You know,

10:56.198 --> 10:59.825
I’ve been trying to figure out
when things started going wrong,

10:59.909 --> 11:04.289
and it seems to line up with the day
you appeared in my kitchen.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.833
Nice try, Park Joon.
Don’t change the subject.

11:09.001 --> 11:09.877
What?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.463
Why did you do it, Joon?

11:12.129 --> 11:13.632
What are you talking about?

11:14.006 --> 11:15.007
I know.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.178
I should have known this whole time.
I was just blinded by my feelings for you.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.641
So blinded by your feelings
that you tried to burn down my restaurant.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.352
No, no, no, you don’t get to sidestep
the issue here, mister.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.811
What issue, Claire?

11:26.894 --> 11:28.729
That you're a murderer!

11:28.896 --> 11:30.773
You’re a murderer, Park Joon.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.067
Are you on drugs?

11:33.150 --> 11:35.654
The only drug that I’m on is the truth.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.405
That doesn’t even make sense!

11:37.489 --> 11:38.573
Yeah?

11:38.657 --> 11:41.576
Well, neither does killing your father!
Or your fiancée!

11:41.660 --> 11:45.580
And then you save my life
so I won’t be onto you, but I’m onto you!

11:48.708 --> 11:53.338
I didn't kill anyone!

11:53.588 --> 11:55.507
Then why weren't you at the memorial?

11:55.590 --> 11:59.594
Because I broke it off with her!
Because I didn’t want to marry her.

12:00.262 --> 12:03.139
And that’s why she killed herself.
Because of me!

12:04.266 --> 12:05.766
B.S.!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.604
And why would I kill my father?

12:09.979 --> 12:11.481
I love my father.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.442
So you wouldn’t have to take over
the company.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.195
Oh, you mean the company
that I’ve taken over?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.157
As opposed
to the restaurant that I’ve lost?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.660
Well, then why would you save me?

12:23.951 --> 12:26.705
You ruined it! This whole place is screwed
because you saved me.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.415
You idiot! You big, stupid idiot.

12:28.498 --> 12:32.335
Oh, I’m an idiot? I’m a big, stupid idiot?

12:32.419 --> 12:34.128
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

12:34.211 --> 12:35.338
Then what are you?

12:35.422 --> 12:36.715
I'm... I'm a...

12:36.839 --> 12:39.925
bigger, stupider

12:40.134 --> 12:41.553
idiot!

13:00.946 --> 13:01.947
So...

13:02.657 --> 13:05.284
We're all set for the reopening, right?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.540
Of course.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.461
Seo-yeon.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.880
Let's give it our all.
I really want this to work.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.674
For us.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.848
Can I take you home?

13:27.932 --> 13:29.434
That's okay.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.687
I've got a few things on my mind
and don't mind walking.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.272
But thank you again for everything.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.858
I'll see you.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.456
Do you believe me now?

13:57.336 --> 13:59.756
I thought
I had finally figured it all out.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.425
Figured out what?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.762
Chapter nine.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.350
You are a strange woman.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.354
You should dress up more often.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.403
[sad music]

14:21.611 --> 14:23.655
I feel like such a fraud.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.033
She knew why I didn’t want to marry her.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.662
Because she's the bitch?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.456
Uh... no.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.543
Because...

14:40.422 --> 14:42.424
Joon, don't.

14:43.675 --> 14:47.011
You can't. And you don't.
You don't even know me.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.557
Exactly. You’re a mystery.

14:51.725 --> 14:55.603
Every woman I’ve ever met,
I know what she’s thinking,

14:55.687 --> 14:58.565
I know what she wants to hear,
but with you...

15:00.190 --> 15:01.860
you’re different.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.278
It’s like you’re an alien or something.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.363
You need to shut up, Joon.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.366
Even the way you say my name.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.202
Even these last few days when I hated you.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.873
And I hated you more than I’ve ever
hated anything--

15:14.955 --> 15:15.874
Joon, stop.

15:15.956 --> 15:19.461
Even when you accused me
of killing my own father.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.505
And I don’t think
that would have been possible if I--

15:22.589 --> 15:24.424
Please. Don't.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.551
Look at me. No.

15:26.801 --> 15:27.802
Why?

15:27.968 --> 15:29.094
Joon...

15:29.554 --> 15:31.263
Do you not feel the same way?

15:31.347 --> 15:32.849
It isn't that.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.477
Then why?

15:36.268 --> 15:38.062
Give me one reason why.

15:46.488 --> 15:51.283
Because if you didn’t kill your father
and Ga-in, someone else did.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.287
And justice must be served.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.718
What's that?

16:10.929 --> 16:11.930
Um...

16:15.057 --> 16:16.893
This is complicated.

16:18.185 --> 16:22.022
And if I saw what you're about to see,
I’d probably lose my mind--

16:22.272 --> 16:23.315
I...

16:25.485 --> 16:29.906
You’ve been through a lot,
and I don’t know what else to do.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.825
[Seth] <i>Rule number four. And, and, and...</i>

16:31.908 --> 16:33.868
<i>this is the most important of them all.</i>

16:34.201 --> 16:37.705
<i>These characters cannot know
they’re in a drama.</i>

16:37.789 --> 16:39.624
Yeap! I know.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.501
Who are you talking to?

16:43.043 --> 16:45.212
Yeah, I know it's risky...

16:45.295 --> 16:46.673
and the world could end,

16:46.756 --> 16:49.425
or our faces could
spontaneously implode, or--

16:51.761 --> 16:53.178
Park Joon!

16:53.262 --> 16:54.346
Yeah?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.182
I really hope this works.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.238
<i>You’re... Park Joon.</i>

17:11.321 --> 17:15.451
<i>-The famous Chef, right?
-What are you doing here?</i>

17:16.536 --> 17:20.039
