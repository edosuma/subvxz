20:27.059 --> 20:28.268
AT THE END OF THE WEEK

20:28.352 --> 20:31.521
TO MARK THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE TOTAL ECLIPSE.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.607
- STUDENTS
WILL WORK IN SMALL GROUPS

20:33.690 --> 20:35.817
TO STUDY THE SCIENCE, NATURE,
TRADITIONS, AND CUSTOMS

20:35.901 --> 20:38.362
OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.905
- AS EVER, WE WILL NEED HELP
WITH THE...

20:39.988 --> 20:43.784
- OOH, OOH, PICK ME, PICK ME.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.369
- ORGANIZATION,
MISS JENKS, VERY GOOD.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.079
- [sighs]

20:47.162 --> 20:49.665
WHAT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE SUN AND THE MOON

20:49.748 --> 20:51.166
ISN'T WORTH KNOWING.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.793
- WELL, MISS JENKS,
YOUR FIRST TASK

20:52.876 --> 20:55.754
WILL BE TO COORDINATE EVERYONE
INTO THEIR "ECLIPSE GROUPS."

20:55.837 --> 20:57.339
- OOH.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.132
DO I GET TO DECIDE
WHO WORKS WITH WHO?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.133
[mouthing words]

21:00.217 --> 21:02.260
- NO, WILLOW, YOU DO NOT.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.180
- EVERYONE
WILL WORK IN THE GROUPS

21:05.263 --> 21:07.599
AND ON THE TASKS
SELECTED FOR THEM.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.892
PLEASE SEE WILLOW FOR DETAILS.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.228
- AND, JEROME,

21:11.311 --> 21:15.023
YOU WILL BE WORKING
WITH PATRICIA, ALFIE, AND JOY.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.066
AND WILLOW,

21:16.149 --> 21:19.069
YOU ARE WITH MARA.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.446
- WE'RE INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE,

21:21.530 --> 21:24.408
FOR THIS
WILL BE A TOTAL ECLIPSE,

21:24.491 --> 21:25.867
VERY RARELY WITNESSED.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.621
WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE
THE ENTIRE SUN GOING BLACK.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.875
- AND HARD WORK
WILL BE REWARDED WITH...

21:33.959 --> 21:35.877
EXTRA CREDIT.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.879
SO GET TO IT, HMM?

21:40.048 --> 21:42.426
- THE ENTIRE SUN GOING BLACK.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.137
- THE SOLAR ECLIPSE.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.180
both: WHEN THE DARK SUN
IS BORN.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.390
- WHAT?

21:48.473 --> 21:50.183
- THAT'S WHY THE RITUAL
WOULDN'T WORK.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.476
THE RITUAL HAS TO BE DONE...

21:51.560 --> 21:52.227
- DURING THE ECLIPSE.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.228
- BUT THERE'S NO WAY

21:53.311 --> 21:55.897
WE CAN DO EVERYTHING
BEFORE THEN.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.109
- WELL?

21:59.192 --> 22:00.402
- ALL SORTED.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.404
WE WILL TRICK THEM
INTO HELPING US WITH THE RITUAL.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.157
- ALL WE NEED NOW
IS THE MISSING PIECE.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.993
VICTOR,
WE MUST HAVE THAT BRACELET.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.494
- [whispering]
THEY HAVE IT.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.705
BUT I SHALL FIND IT.

22:11.788 --> 22:16.209
THOSE BRATS
WILL NOT STAND IN MY WAY.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.961
[ominous musical flourish]
