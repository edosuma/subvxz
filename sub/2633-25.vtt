WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:06.714
What? What did you... What?

00:08.717 --> 00:10.300
I still love you.

00:10.552 --> 00:13.971
I know I shouldn't even
be here telling you this.

00:14.222 --> 00:16.432
You're with Chandler, a guy I really like.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.600
You say he's straight, I'll believe you.

00:20.770 --> 00:24.606
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd always regret it.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.943
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.864
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

00:32.531 --> 00:37.077
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place...

00:37.287 --> 00:39.121
...but I had to tell you.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.166
I want to spend my life with you
and marry you.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.753
I want to have kids with you.

00:48.339 --> 00:49.631
Oh, my God.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.301
Why don't they put chairs back here?

00:53.845 --> 00:57.014
I know this is crazy, but am I too late?

00:57.515 --> 01:00.976
Yes, you're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.604
I know. I was an idiot.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.190
And I tried to forget you. I really did.

01:06.441 --> 01:11.236
After we had lunch last year,
I spent six months in Africa trying to forget.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.823
- What were you doing in Africa?
- Working with blind kids.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.534
What are you doing to me?

01:18.036 --> 01:19.620
Look, I...

01:19.871 --> 01:23.415
I'm sorry, but it's not gonna happen.

01:23.666 --> 01:27.169
That's fine. I'll walk away.
And I'll never bother you again.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.256
Only if you tell me Chandler's
willing to give you everything I am.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.426
Well, he is. I mean...

01:34.636 --> 01:36.970
...marriage is all he talks about.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.263
My goodness.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.100
In fact, I'm the one making him wait.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.476
- You are?
- Yeah.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.645
- Why?
- Why?

01:45.688 --> 01:47.564
Because of the government.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.358
Isn't it incredible?

02:31.651 --> 02:34.611
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.906
I know. They'll be so happy together.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.034
Two best friends in love.
How often does that happen?

02:41.286 --> 02:43.245
- Not that often.
- No.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.831
I'm so happy for them.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.500
Me too. So happy for them.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.587
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

02:52.172 --> 02:56.008
- Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.
- Mm-mm.

03:00.638 --> 03:04.725
I'm probably 98 percent happy
and maybe 2 percent jealous.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.518
What's 2 percent? That's nothing.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.270
Totally.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.400
- I'm like 90-10.
- Yeah. Me too.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.365
Hey, have you guys seen Chandler?

03:23.953 --> 03:26.622
No. But you know who
was looking for you?

03:26.831 --> 03:28.081
Tennille.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.926
So that marriage stuff
you were saying yesterday?

03:39.135 --> 03:41.720
- You don't really believe that.
- Sure, I do.

03:41.971 --> 03:45.557
In fact, I think the whole concept
of marriage is unnatural.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.561
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.105
Pigs don't mate for life.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.943
A pig can have 100 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

03:56.194 --> 04:00.197
And that's just an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.699
Wait a minute.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.870
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.623
Never say never, but, probably...

04:09.874 --> 04:11.291
...yeah, never.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.543
Oh, my God.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.588
Then what are we even doing?
What is this?

04:16.839 --> 04:20.216
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is all this pressure?

04:20.802 --> 04:22.552
Is this some new strategy?

04:22.804 --> 04:26.515
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, man-trap?

04:28.017 --> 04:30.018
You know what? I gotta go.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.815
It's okay. I got a plan.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.115
- We're gonna find love.
- Definitely.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.327
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

04:47.912 --> 04:52.124
That's what makes it so easy to be
80 percent happy for Monica and Chandler.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.295
- Would be nice to have a guarantee.
- What do you mean?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.797
Some people make deals with a friend.

04:59.048 --> 05:03.635
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.512
- You mean a backup?
- Exactly.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.514
Yeah, yeah. I've got that.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.517
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.019
- Who?
- Joey?

05:12.270 --> 05:15.188
- Joey? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.107
Yeah, I locked him in years ago.

05:20.278 --> 05:25.324
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.284
Yep. We shook on it.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.955
Yeah. But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.666
Seriously?

05:34.876 --> 05:36.835
I think his exact words were...

05:39.589 --> 05:40.839
Charming.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.842
- Ah, he's just a backup.
- Yeah.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.226
Hey, Monica.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.645
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.940
It's for my boat. Cool, huh?

05:59.609 --> 06:00.859
Yeah, it's great.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.612
What's the matter? Talk to the captain.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.992
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.952
Chandler's giving you a hard time?

06:11.162 --> 06:14.498
I don't want to get married tomorrow.
But I want to believe...

06:14.707 --> 06:17.751
...we're going somewhere,
that I'm not wasting my time.

06:18.002 --> 06:21.088
- You know Chandler.
- No, I don't know Chandler.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.425
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

06:25.676 --> 06:26.927
Maybe you changed.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.262
I didn't change.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.390
Maybe that's the problem.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.977
- What?
- Chandler is a complex fellow.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.897
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.070
Does he think I'll just
wait around for nothing?

06:45.321 --> 06:48.323
Face it. Chandler is against marriage.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.575
And always will be.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.538
Well, there's some people
who do want to marry me.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.207
- There are?
- Yeah. Richard.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.584
Richard said he wants to marry you?

07:01.337 --> 07:04.297
- And Chandler says he hates marriage?
- That's right.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.134
Chandler loves marriage!

07:09.429 --> 07:11.555
You just told me he hates marriage!

07:11.806 --> 07:15.308
That he's a complex fellow
who's unlikely to take a wife!

07:15.560 --> 07:18.103
That he's against marriage
and always will be!

07:18.563 --> 07:20.730
You got that from what I said?

07:27.905 --> 07:30.407
- Rach.
- Hey, you.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.535
- Hey, come on in.
- Thank you.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.997
I'm so sorry
to hear about you and Elizabeth.

07:37.248 --> 07:41.251
Thanks. Yeah, I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.587
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.380
Yeah. Love.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.341
It's a tricky business, isn't it?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.719
I guess so.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.388
So, what do you say we make a pact?

07:53.639 --> 07:57.142
If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.437
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other...

08:00.688 --> 08:04.649
...we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises there.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.610
No, like, "What's that?"

08:09.906 --> 08:14.159
- Oh, you want me to be your backup.
- Exactly.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.495
Oh, yeah. I already have one.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.289
- Who?
- Phoebe.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.790
Phoebe?

08:21.667 --> 08:24.419
But she just said Joey is her backup.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.922
Oh, I don't think so.

08:27.715 --> 08:31.510
I just spoke with her.
She said that she and Joey made a deal.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.679
That's impossible.
We have had a deal for years.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.347
We shook on it.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.059
Although, believe me,
she wanted to do a lot more than that.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.690
Where have you been?

08:46.609 --> 08:49.611
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.533
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.785
- What?
- I've been looking for you.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.411
Stop messing with her!

08:58.663 --> 09:02.415
And I would have if these damn
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

09:03.084 --> 09:05.210
- Oh, my God!
- I know! They suck!

09:06.295 --> 09:09.297
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!

09:09.549 --> 09:10.924
- I know!
- What...?

09:11.133 --> 09:14.886
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!

09:15.263 --> 09:16.763
Will you help me?

09:18.641 --> 09:21.601
Look, us getting our asses kicked
is not a solution.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.687
Okay?

09:23.896 --> 09:27.274
- Look, just go and find Monica.
- You're right.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.734
I'm gonna get the ring...

09:29.986 --> 09:31.403
...I'll go find her...

09:31.821 --> 09:33.071
...and I'll propose!

09:33.906 --> 09:35.240
Dude! Dude! Dude!

09:36.325 --> 09:39.494
That coconut phone
might be good for the boat.

09:55.219 --> 10:00.265
Hi.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.811
I don't know why I'm here.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.063
I didn't ask.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.984
You want to come in?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.652
I don't know.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.155
Oh, okay.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.117
I'll just leave the door open
and go sit on the couch.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.496
Chandler is such an idiot!

10:23.748 --> 10:24.998
Drink?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.752
- Scotch on the...
- Rocks with a twist?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.004
I remember.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.593
- You still smoking cigars?
- Uh...

10:36.927 --> 10:39.346
No, no. That's art.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.433
If it bothers you, I can put my art out.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.853
No, that's okay.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.815
So, Monica...

10:51.108 --> 10:52.817
...let me ask you a question.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.320
Since we broke up, do you ever...

10:55.613 --> 10:56.821
...think about me?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.451
Actually, I thought about you
a couple months ago.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.787
- Really?
- Yeah, but it's because I...

11:04.038 --> 11:07.499
...had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.335
- Who is it?
- Edward Nevsky.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.045
Yeah, he's no good.

11:14.131 --> 11:17.300
Do you ever think about me in...

11:18.135 --> 11:19.678
...a non-eye-doctor way?

11:19.970 --> 11:21.221
No.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.973
Ah.

11:25.726 --> 11:29.604
Because getting over you was
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.482
I never let myself think about you.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.276
Wow.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.034
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

11:43.285 --> 11:44.953
You can't have two backups!

11:45.621 --> 11:47.247
Of course I can.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.083
It's just good sense
to back up your backup.

11:50.334 --> 11:53.002
- Look, I've already lost Chandler.
- What?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.171
Hey, Phoebe!

11:55.423 --> 11:56.715
We're both backups?

11:56.924 --> 11:59.551
How could you do this to me?

12:00.261 --> 12:04.431
What are you complaining about?
You were both aware of the situation.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.558
- I was not!
- No, we weren't!

12:06.809 --> 12:10.437
This kind of back talk
isn't gonna fly when we're married.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.398
You can't have both. Pick one.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.108
- Pick me!
- No, pick me!

12:15.359 --> 12:17.986
I don't want to end up an old maid.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.530
Well, let's see.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.991
Ross is a good father.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.492
But...

12:24.744 --> 12:27.120
...Joey has a boat. This is hard.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.581
This is crazy. I want to switch to Rachel.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.166
I want to switch too.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.960
No, wait! Okay, just wait!

12:34.128 --> 12:37.213
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.466
Remember my promise:

12:39.675 --> 12:42.677
If we get married, three times a week.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.471
Oh, my God. Phoebe...

12:44.722 --> 12:47.098
I'm talking about massages.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.517
No, I'm not.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.356
I know how to settle this.
Here's what we'll do.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.817
I'll write "Joey"...

12:58.027 --> 12:59.319
...on one napkin.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.447
And I'm going to write "Ross"
on the other napkin...

13:02.698 --> 13:04.324
...and we'll pick one.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.993
That person will be our backup.
Here we go.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.870
- That sounds fair.
- All right.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.663
Good. Switching them up.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.415
Ooh...

13:15.085 --> 13:16.795
- Pick one.
- Left.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.923
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.511
- Ross.
- Joey.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.807
- We should just switch.
- Absolutely.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.312
I miss this apartment.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.856
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.484
- I should be with a grownup, you know?
- Yeah.

13:39.902 --> 13:44.030
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.865
Maybe someone with...

13:47.284 --> 13:49.953
...a license to practice medicine.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.955
Or a mustache.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.000
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.128
I need to be with someone
who wants the same things.

13:59.338 --> 14:03.716
Coming to my work and telling me
you love me, I want that!

14:04.385 --> 14:08.096
Talking about pig sex over lunch,
I don't want that!

14:09.431 --> 14:11.015
I think that's fair.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.352
Fair? Please.
Don't even talk to me about fair.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.480
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.

14:17.731 --> 14:20.108
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.736
Believe me, nothing about this
is fair. Nothing.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.865
- Nothing! Nothing!
- It's okay.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.284
Hey. Shh.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.912
Nothing.

14:37.459 --> 14:40.628
I don't know.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.006
I know.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.467
Yeah, I... I...

14:47.177 --> 14:49.637
I have to figure...

14:49.889 --> 14:52.473
...some stuff, before I can...

14:52.683 --> 14:54.183
Yeah, I understand.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.520
Take as much time as you want.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.398
Ten, 20 minutes, if you need it.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.861
I'll be here. Not smoking.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.171
- Chandler.
- Where is she?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.298
I'm not scared of you.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.844
She's not here. And please come in.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.555
Scotch on the rocks...

15:32.765 --> 15:35.183
...with a twist, on a coaster.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.935
Monica? Monica?

15:38.812 --> 15:41.189
Okay, she was here. But she left.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.815
Where did she go?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.568
She said she had to think things over.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.198
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.200
Oh, hey. Look, nothing happened.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.329
Nothing happened? Nothing?
You didn't tell her you love her?

15:56.580 --> 15:59.248
Well, all right, one thing happened.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.334
You know what you did?

16:01.543 --> 16:03.836
My girlfriend is thinking things over.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.297
You made my girlfriend think!

16:08.008 --> 16:09.676
Well, I'm sorry.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.929
What's to think about? I love her.

16:13.180 --> 16:17.225
Well, apparently I'm willing
to offer her things that you are not.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.812
I'm willing to offer her those things.
This was just a plan.

16:21.063 --> 16:25.608
To throw her off so when I offered
all these things, she'd be surprised.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.821
If it helps, it worked very well.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.866
It was working till you showed up,
you big tree.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.454
This isn't fair.

16:38.706 --> 16:42.125
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!

16:42.376 --> 16:44.502
This is my chance and I won't blow it...

16:44.712 --> 16:47.005
...because we are meant for each other.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.550
And this has all just been
one stupid mistake!

16:51.260 --> 16:53.469
I was gonna propose tonight.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.598
You were?

16:58.434 --> 16:59.934
Yeah, I even...

17:00.853 --> 17:02.103
...got a ring.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.313
Did you get a ring?

17:04.647 --> 17:06.273
No, I don't have a ring.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.156
You go get her.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.119
And can I give you a piece of advice?

17:19.413 --> 17:21.204
If you do get her...

17:22.290 --> 17:23.958
...don't let her go.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.626
Trust me.

17:28.589 --> 17:32.050
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.803
I know.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.347
I hate that.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.238
- Dude.
- I've gotta find Monica.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.448
She's gone.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.243
- What?
- She had a bag and she left.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.454
- What?
- She was crying.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.916
She said you want different things
and she needs to think.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.543
Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?

18:07.795 --> 18:11.047
I did! I told her everything.
She wouldn't believe me.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.423
Well, where...?

18:12.633 --> 18:13.883
Where did she go?

18:14.134 --> 18:16.677
To her parents'.
She said you shouldn't call.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.388
But if I were you, I would.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.599
Can't believe I ruined this.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.185
I am so sorry, man.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.365
You wanted it to be a surprise.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.335
Oh, my God.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.343
Chandler...

18:58.804 --> 19:00.680
...in all my life...

19:01.515 --> 19:04.016
...I never thought I would be so lucky...

19:07.646 --> 19:11.315
...as to fall in love with my best...

19:12.651 --> 19:14.235
My best...

19:15.362 --> 19:19.073
- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.951
I'll do it. I thought...

19:26.206 --> 19:27.832
Wait, I can do this.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.881
I thought that it mattered...

19:35.090 --> 19:38.634
...what I said or where I said it.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.345
Then I realized...

19:41.805 --> 19:44.891
...the only thing that matters is that you...

19:48.520 --> 19:52.857
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.029
And if you let me...

19:58.697 --> 20:02.825
...I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.461
Monica...

20:15.380 --> 20:16.714
...will you marry me?

20:18.967 --> 20:20.551
Yes.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.776
I knew you were likely to take a wife!

20:39.780 --> 20:42.281
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

20:43.450 --> 20:45.076
Come in! Come in!

20:47.120 --> 20:48.913
We're engaged!

20:54.169 --> 20:55.419
Oh!

20:55.671 --> 20:58.714
This is the least jealous I've ever been!

20:59.341 --> 21:02.385
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!

21:02.678 --> 21:03.844
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.390
He's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!

21:07.683 --> 21:09.433
Yeah.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.377
Oh, my darling

21:36.545 --> 21:42.300
You were wonderful tonight
