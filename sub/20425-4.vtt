00:00.375 --> 00:02.575
- I'm a little nervous.
- Do you wanna see a doctor?

00:02.610 --> 00:04.170
We could get you on
a mood stabilizer.

00:04.212 --> 00:05.592
<i>Previously on "Famous in Love."</i>

00:05.622 --> 00:07.492
I never made any promises.

00:07.532 --> 00:08.812
<i>Paige Townsen ended up</i>

00:08.850 --> 00:10.186
<i>being the best
choice for the role.</i>

00:10.210 --> 00:11.730
Remember we agreed
on 50 more bucks?

00:11.769 --> 00:14.019
<i>I need the money for school.</i>

00:14.047 --> 00:16.622
What if Tangey booked the
main title song for "Locked?"

00:16.662 --> 00:18.770
That would create some buzz.

00:18.843 --> 00:20.263
If she needs the records out

00:20.303 --> 00:22.120
with your son, we can
make that happen.

00:22.145 --> 00:23.205
<i>Why don't we let our
children work out</i>

00:23.206 --> 00:24.433

00:24.458 --> 00:26.848
- Look, I'm sorry about...
- It's over, okay?

00:26.879 --> 00:28.071
We're two adults,
there's nothing

00:28.095 --> 00:29.378
wrong in what we're doin'.

00:29.403 --> 00:31.113
It's a little bit wrong.

00:31.129 --> 00:33.059
You hate her, so why are
you reading his script?

00:33.098 --> 00:35.469
Because I would be
perfect for the lead.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.048
She's never gonna help you.

00:37.085 --> 00:39.571
Her agents liked the script
and they wanna wrap me.

00:40.211 --> 00:41.651
They just started
buildin' our sets.

<i>I should be making
you breakfast.</i>

00:58.230 --> 01:00.180
It's your first day
shooting "Locked."

01:00.816 --> 01:02.096
I still can't believe

01:02.134 --> 01:03.794
you're playing
opposite Rainer Devon.

01:03.835 --> 01:06.305
I'm so excited, but I'm like

01:06.346 --> 01:08.406
incredibly nervous, Cass.

01:08.441 --> 01:10.151
Of course, you
should feel nervous.

01:10.184 --> 01:11.898
You would be insane not to.

01:11.899 --> 01:14.219
'They picked you out of
thousands of actresses'

01:14.253 --> 01:15.703
'to play the lead
role of August'

01:15.737 --> 01:17.742
because you are
perfect for the role.

01:19.159 --> 01:20.396
'You've got this.'

01:21.627 --> 01:23.777
You know that Jake still
didn't come home last night.

01:23.820 --> 01:25.410
Yeah, he texted me. He's fine.

01:25.447 --> 01:27.538
He's in the desert
working on his script.

01:28.169 --> 01:29.629
He just needs some space.

01:30.748 --> 01:33.445
Ooh, I hope you're right.

01:33.801 --> 01:36.699
Okay, so when do you
wanna come by set today?

01:36.741 --> 01:38.671
We can take selfies
when nobody's looking.

01:38.710 --> 01:41.800
Oh, I would love to,
but I have work.

01:41.838 --> 01:44.533
Uh... School work. Big bio exam.

01:46.126 --> 01:49.066
Okay, well, we're still
FaceTiming later

01:49.096 --> 01:51.096
so I can show you what my
dressing room looks like.

01:52.219 --> 01:53.875
Oh, what is this?

01:54.485 --> 01:56.323
I think for you!

01:59.732 --> 02:01.902
"Paige, congrats on the
start of a long career.

02:01.942 --> 02:03.244
Welcome to the Gold
Brothers Family."

02:03.268 --> 02:05.593
Oh, my God, this is
your first swag bag.

02:05.991 --> 02:07.981
Shut up.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.451
Is that...

02:12.302 --> 02:15.302
The three diamond bracelet
Beyonce gave Solange after

02:15.338 --> 02:17.368
after the elevator incident.

02:17.407 --> 02:19.707
- Casual yes.
- Wow.

02:19.751 --> 02:21.161
Sell my soul for one of those

02:21.194 --> 02:24.154
and my soul would be
worth around $4000.

02:24.189 --> 02:26.649
I am so jealous. Paige, do
you realize how lucky you...

02:26.683 --> 02:28.261
What are you doing?

02:28.312 --> 02:30.024
Cassie, none of this

02:30.061 --> 02:31.872
would have been
possible without you.

02:32.949 --> 02:34.009
Paige, I can't...

02:34.035 --> 02:35.440
Yes, you can.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.407
We're in this together, right?

02:38.244 --> 02:40.571
Now I gotta go before I'm late.

02:40.684 --> 02:41.814
You've got this.

02:59.485 --> 03:00.815
What are you doin' here?

03:00.840 --> 03:02.120
It's the first day, right?

03:02.126 --> 03:03.911
I always pick you up on the
first day of the shoot.

03:03.935 --> 03:05.463
Just because I've got
a later call time

03:05.487 --> 03:07.007
does not mean we break
from tradition.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.320
My mom's in Hawaii, dealing
with a location crisis

03:09.353 --> 03:11.057
and she'll kill me if I'm
late on my first day.

03:11.081 --> 03:12.215
And you want maximum
off-screen time

03:12.239 --> 03:13.776
with Paige Townsen.

03:14.081 --> 03:15.377
You runnin' that game already?

03:15.534 --> 03:17.194
It's not like that.
I really like her.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.890
- She's special.
- Mm.

03:18.940 --> 03:20.791
Hey, how's the, uh, hotel
life treating you?

03:20.831 --> 03:23.265
I'm kinda over it. I'm thinkin'
of buyin' my own place.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.393
If you need to crash here
while you look, that's cool.

03:25.417 --> 03:27.105
It got crowded here last time.

03:27.589 --> 03:29.007
You and the revolving
door of women.

03:29.031 --> 03:30.371
We had some great parties.

03:30.453 --> 03:32.277
We did, but me moving back in

03:32.302 --> 03:34.004
we haven't really worked
anything out, have we?

03:34.028 --> 03:35.801
Tangey thing's in the past.
We're good.

03:35.871 --> 03:37.303
I trust you.

03:37.770 --> 03:38.887

video village?

04:34.861 --> 04:36.510
Now that's William's set dec.

04:36.547 --> 04:38.507
He flew to Paris to pick up

04:38.540 --> 04:41.100
some fancy-schmancy stuff
for August's home.

04:41.483 --> 04:44.222

August's kitchen?

Oh, my goodness.

05:15.117 --> 05:17.197
'There's the blue table
and the red tea pot.'

05:17.227 --> 05:19.481
I-it's exactly like in the book.

05:19.599 --> 05:21.973
Paige! Arthur, first AD.

05:22.006 --> 05:24.036
- Hi, Arthur. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:24.068 --> 05:26.348
My kid did not give a crap
when I did "Spiderman"

05:26.378 --> 05:28.328
but she will not stop
talkin' about August.

05:28.355 --> 05:30.155
You're her favorite
character of all-time.

05:30.190 --> 05:32.490
Well, August is her
favorite character.

05:32.525 --> 05:34.365
No, you're August now.

Ah, there she is.

05:52.378 --> 05:53.568
Hi, Wyatt.

05:53.922 --> 05:56.252
Day one on a $200 million movie.

05:56.282 --> 05:57.282
Not bad, huh?

05:57.674 --> 06:02.082
Uh, what? Sorry, what?
$200 million?

06:02.083 --> 06:04.223
Largest tent-pole Gold
Brothers has ever done.

06:04.252 --> 06:05.622
Two hundred and eighty
one people on the crew

06:05.645 --> 06:06.906
and you are the star
of this thing, Paige.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.210
We got a lot riding on you.

06:08.248 --> 06:09.548
We're, uh, we're still lighting

06:09.583 --> 06:10.973
so, uh, have a seat.

06:11.001 --> 06:13.201
Two hundred and
eighty one, Cassie.

06:13.236 --> 06:15.066
That's almost 300
people that would lose

06:15.105 --> 06:17.135
their jobs if I
suck in this movie.

06:17.174 --> 06:19.254
First off, you are
not going to suck.

06:19.624 --> 06:20.994
How do you know that?

06:21.026 --> 06:23.066
Because freshman
year, Megan Taylor

06:23.111 --> 06:24.505
got mono and couldn't
go in on "Streetcar."

06:24.529 --> 06:26.561
You stepped in with
two hours notice

06:26.687 --> 06:27.757
and you nailed it.

06:27.796 --> 06:29.249
I was her understudy!

06:29.274 --> 06:31.338
Yeah, but you still nailed it.

06:31.827 --> 06:35.804
You're Paige Townsen, best
friend, karaoke wizard

06:36.171 --> 06:39.831

international superstar.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.956

- No, not really new.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.233
It's the same song I've
been singin' for a decade.

07:19.257 --> 07:20.975
Just different lyrics.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.350

joining the movie?

07:28.395 --> 07:30.845

I'm an actress now.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.302
No.

07:32.327 --> 07:35.037
No, my mom just wants me
to be a triple threat.

07:35.234 --> 07:36.932
Ah. I get it.

07:37.421 --> 07:39.341
I guess we'll be seein' a
lot more of each other.

07:41.583 --> 07:44.398
I think we will. That's
a good thing, I hope.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.509
Oh... Look...

07:52.271 --> 07:53.791
What happened that
night in Chicago...

07:55.916 --> 07:58.886
That was a really...
great night but...

08:02.518 --> 08:03.944
it can't happen again.

08:09.547 --> 08:11.457
What? Um...

08:15.019 --> 08:17.379
So you don't have any
feelings for me?

08:17.413 --> 08:18.413
You know I do.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.090
But we can't go there.
Rainer's my best friend.

08:22.114 --> 08:23.638
And we're finally back on track.

08:25.193 --> 08:27.558
Right. Right.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.300
Rainer comes first as usual.

08:31.336 --> 08:34.051
- Don't be like that.
- 'Tangey, darlin'.'

08:34.491 --> 08:36.607
That album is not going
to record itself.

08:37.793 --> 08:39.409
I have to get back
to set anyway.

08:39.797 --> 08:41.806
- I'll catch you later.
- Okay.

08:50.199 --> 08:52.429
She doesn't need
any distractions.

08:52.468 --> 08:54.405
You're right. She
needs a friend.

08:54.488 --> 08:55.838
And I suppose that's you?

08:55.873 --> 08:57.603
Tangey's always
been there for me.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.454
And we've been friends since she was 16.
I care about her...

08:59.472 --> 09:01.662
So that little
do-si-do you two had

09:01.699 --> 09:03.820
the one I'm still doin'
damage control on

09:04.894 --> 09:06.614
were you just bein' a
friend that night too?

09:09.478 --> 09:11.343
Ann-Margret had hair like this.

09:12.693 --> 09:13.770
Felt like silk.

09:16.668 --> 09:19.031
Oh, your first
distraction is here.

09:20.696 --> 09:22.790
Oh, good morning, Lil.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.683
- 'Oh...'
- It's so good to see you.

09:24.724 --> 09:27.330
Hey, hon, have a seat.
You're on deck.

09:30.154 --> 09:31.398
Congratulations on
your first day.

09:31.422 --> 09:33.799
Thanks. You too.

09:34.850 --> 09:35.930
I got something for you.

09:37.996 --> 09:40.325
- What? Why?
- Yeah.

09:40.357 --> 09:41.547
Just open it.

09:53.686 --> 09:55.486
I thought you could wear
it on our first date.

09:58.533 --> 09:59.706
That's me asking you out.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.333
- I, uh...
- You don't like it?

10:08.368 --> 10:10.928
I'm sorry. I-I
can't accept this.

10:11.546 --> 10:13.972
Uh... of course, you can.

10:13.997 --> 10:15.714
It's-it's a P for Paige.
That's you.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.654

10:20.146 --> 10:22.907

It's my first day.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.427

10:33.879 --> 10:36.104
First scene. You ready?

10:36.139 --> 10:38.359
Yeah, I think so.
Um, where's Alexis?

10:38.399 --> 10:40.649
I would just love to, um,
rehearse a few lines with her.

10:40.693 --> 10:43.375
Oh, she's out sick.
Sinus infection.

10:43.538 --> 10:45.169
Did you not get the
new call sheet?

10:45.356 --> 10:47.652
- New call sheet?
- Oh, man.

10:48.084 --> 10:50.704
They did a rewrite. We're
doing scene 25 now.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.577
- I, I don't know the scene.
- You'll be fine.

10:52.614 --> 10:54.134
'Well, let's rehearse, people.'

10:55.575 --> 10:56.655
'Right over here.'

10:58.796 --> 11:00.756
- Hey, Paige.
- Hi, Jordan. Hi.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.263
We-we haven't had a chance
to talk since the audition

11:04.300 --> 11:05.995
unless you count the scene
dialogue, of course.

11:06.019 --> 11:07.274
But, you know, the, the...

11:07.352 --> 11:10.220
I don't really count that.
I was talking, you know.

11:12.351 --> 11:13.500
How's it goin'?

11:13.927 --> 11:15.767
Actually, not great.

11:15.795 --> 11:18.185
Uh, I don't know this
scene very well.

11:18.223 --> 11:20.482
And by very well, I mean at all.

11:21.154 --> 11:23.350
Don't be nervous. Just
focus on the words.

11:24.428 --> 11:26.048
Alright.

11:26.081 --> 11:28.314
Alright, quiet, everybody.
Rehearsal's up.

11:30.121 --> 11:31.493
And action.

11:31.519 --> 11:32.605
What happened to us?

11:34.173 --> 11:37.794
We just... drifted apart.

11:37.834 --> 11:40.194
As scripted, please.
From the top.

11:40.228 --> 11:41.538
And action.

11:41.571 --> 11:43.153
What happened to us?

11:43.985 --> 11:48.214
We just didn't work and...

11:48.912 --> 11:51.132
Hey, I-I'm really very sorry.

11:51.172 --> 11:53.797
Um, I didn't know to check
for a new call sheet

11:53.798 --> 11:56.348
so I actually just don't know
the lines for this scene.

11:56.376 --> 11:57.896
If I could just have
a few minutes to...

11:57.919 --> 11:59.539
- 'You need a few minutes?'
- Yeah.

11:59.579 --> 12:02.229
You know what, even
ten would be amazing.

12:02.316 --> 12:03.766
Right. Hey, everybody!

12:03.801 --> 12:05.674
Uh, Paige just needs
a few minutes

12:05.675 --> 12:09.015
so let's just stop production,
so she can learn her lines.

12:09.054 --> 12:11.244
Alright? You come to my
set prepared, people!

12:20.974 --> 12:22.646
Brody was right about you.

12:22.670 --> 12:25.820
I'm glad you finally agreed
to pick up a new client.

12:26.241 --> 12:28.341
Is there a room you'd
like me to do next?

12:28.377 --> 12:29.687
Whatever you prefer.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.520
I'll tackle the
dining room then.

12:31.555 --> 12:33.855
But can you just do one
thing for me first?

12:34.390 --> 12:36.630
Uh, that depends.

12:39.429 --> 12:40.793
Would you mind putting this on?

12:43.789 --> 12:46.476
You need to leave soon for your
wardrobe fitting at the studio.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.422
I'm headed down to San
Diego for the night

12:48.469 --> 12:50.569
so I won't be back

12:50.605 --> 12:52.305
for your appearance
on "Conan" tomorrow.

12:52.352 --> 12:53.992
But you'll do "Heart Eyes."

12:54.626 --> 12:56.063
How did it feel in the
studio this morning?

12:56.087 --> 12:58.631
- Fine, I guess.
- Just fine?

12:58.670 --> 13:00.850
Tangey, it's a great song.

13:00.889 --> 13:02.509
You know, they almost
gave it to Katy Perry.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.936
Oh, I know, I know. It's just...

13:06.280 --> 13:07.742
It's just...

13:10.978 --> 13:12.578
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

13:13.535 --> 13:14.625
Mm-hmm.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.917
I've been workin'
on some new music

13:16.951 --> 13:19.141
and I thought maybe
"The Conan Show"

13:19.169 --> 13:21.001
would be a good
time to try it out.

13:21.846 --> 13:23.677
Uh, that's a no, young lady.

13:23.702 --> 13:26.382
- You haven't even heard it?
- I don't need to hear it.

13:26.851 --> 13:29.421
Please, don't try to Miley
Cyrus your ass into edgy.

13:29.461 --> 13:31.461
Ma, it's not even like that.

13:31.497 --> 13:34.703
Baby, stick to the Tangey Turner
everybody knows and loves.

13:34.704 --> 13:36.464
The one who sold out The
Garden in two hours

13:36.497 --> 13:38.595
on her "Never Lie" tour.

13:39.643 --> 13:42.301
Boo, now is not the time
to change things up.

13:42.859 --> 13:43.859
'You hear me?'

13:45.366 --> 13:48.062
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

13:48.455 --> 13:50.789
'And stay from Jordan.'

13:50.828 --> 13:53.119
I don't have time to clean up
another one of your messes.

13:53.897 --> 13:56.991
Don't worry. I won't be
seeing much of him anymore.

13:58.439 --> 14:00.249
It was so embarrassing, Cassie.

14:00.282 --> 14:02.827
I pushed two hours
behind schedule.

14:03.435 --> 14:05.975
Hey, is your FaceTime
still not working?

14:06.005 --> 14:07.605
'Have you heard anything
else from Jake?'

14:07.623 --> 14:10.573
You know the Wi-Fi at
the library is sketch.

14:10.609 --> 14:12.319
Right. Well, how goes
the studying anyway?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.572
Maybe you can come by later
if you finish up in time

14:15.606 --> 14:17.217
considering I kind of laid
Rainer off this morning.

14:17.241 --> 14:20.311
- Why?
- 'He... a-asked me out.'

14:20.344 --> 14:22.581
- And I turned him down.
- Shut up right now.

14:22.630 --> 14:25.267
What? W-why would you do that?

14:25.292 --> 14:27.053
He gave me the necklace.

14:27.084 --> 14:29.373
No, he didn't. Your
initial, you got a P?

14:29.433 --> 14:31.270
'Yes. He gave me the P and
I gave it right back.'

14:31.294 --> 14:33.674
Just like Selena got an
S and Tangey got a T.

14:33.713 --> 14:37.363
And I guess I'm just the
next letter in line.

14:37.754 --> 14:38.954
What a player, man.

14:38.988 --> 14:41.982
I really have to just focus
on this movie right now.

14:41.983 --> 14:44.443
'Lacey, where-where are you?'

14:44.857 --> 14:46.667
Lacey? Who's Lacey?

14:46.700 --> 14:50.046
Oh, that's my... lab partner.

14:50.697 --> 14:52.447
Total ADD. Always wandering off.

14:52.481 --> 14:53.962
But, hey, I gotta go.

14:53.963 --> 14:56.163
When you get home, I want full deets.
Leave nothing out.

14:56.643 --> 14:57.643
Oh.

15:02.678 --> 15:04.228
- Oh...
- Sorry.

15:04.263 --> 15:06.743
Hi, Tangey. Um...

15:07.667 --> 15:09.437
Hey, congrats on
joining the movie.

15:09.468 --> 15:12.538
Thanks. I have to get to
wardrobe actually, so...

15:12.580 --> 15:13.580
Wait. Just...

15:15.432 --> 15:16.752
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

15:18.060 --> 15:20.555
I'm sorry... okay?

15:22.193 --> 15:24.362
You were right.
You deserve more.

15:24.762 --> 15:27.392
But I-I was... hopin' that
we can move past that

15:27.423 --> 15:29.173
and be friends again.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.328
Like how you and Jordan
are friends again?

15:31.369 --> 15:32.952
We worked through our
stuff and we're good.

15:32.976 --> 15:35.191
Too bad you didn't consider
what that meant for me though.

15:35.215 --> 15:36.639
What does that have
to do with you?

15:36.664 --> 15:38.221
Wake up, Rainer.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.103
As long as you and
Jordan are friends

15:40.143 --> 15:41.803
Jordan thinks that we
can't be anything.

15:53.505 --> 15:55.575
Oh, damn, sorry about that.

15:55.608 --> 15:56.968
Um...

16:01.047 --> 16:03.209
That's not part of the service.

16:03.783 --> 16:05.287
Extra 200 in it for you.

16:10.531 --> 16:14.424
I noticed that you have
a jacuzzi outside.

16:15.094 --> 16:17.894
Maybe we could both get a
little more comfortable.

16:17.930 --> 16:19.984
Uh. I'll lead the way.

16:33.757 --> 16:35.287
What, what's going on?

16:35.326 --> 16:37.386
Like I said, that's not
part of the service.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.237
Joke's on me. Alright,
just open the door.

16:39.272 --> 16:41.062
Yeah, I don't, I don't think so.

16:41.098 --> 16:43.198
But enjoy the sunshine.

16:43.225 --> 16:46.074
And be careful not
to get burned.

16:47.519 --> 16:49.346
Come on. Lacey!

16:49.707 --> 16:51.713
You can't leave me
out here, Lacey.

16:52.457 --> 16:54.935
Lacey, open the door. You
can't leave me out here.

16:54.971 --> 16:57.656
'Come on. Open the door!'

17:09.795 --> 17:11.145
Oh, hi.

17:13.314 --> 17:14.844
I thought you were shooting.

17:14.884 --> 17:16.227
I'm up next.

17:17.051 --> 17:18.442
How was your fitting?
You don't look happy.

17:18.463 --> 17:20.343
I don't know. There's a
lot going on right now.

17:20.596 --> 17:24.041
The movie, the new album... you.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.635
- Tangey, try to understand...
- It's fine.

17:26.662 --> 17:29.913
I should... go.

17:30.224 --> 17:31.754
I have to rehearse for
"Conan" tomorrow.

17:31.775 --> 17:34.292
"Conan" again? That's great.

17:34.293 --> 17:37.693
Mom's making me. She says I need
advance press on the new album.

17:38.054 --> 17:39.704
Your mom makes you
do a lot of things.

17:39.739 --> 17:42.119
She means well. I wouldn't
be where I am without her.

17:42.158 --> 17:44.118
You're where you are
because you're talented.

17:44.143 --> 17:46.247
You're passionate and you
sing from the heart.

17:47.154 --> 17:48.924
Not with that stuff I'm
singin' right now.

17:48.949 --> 17:51.567
- So change it.
- You know I can't.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.797
I have a new album coming out.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.736
A fan base I can't alienate.

17:55.737 --> 17:57.777
What makes you think they
won't like your new stuff?

18:01.523 --> 18:03.403
It's just not worth
fighting her on it.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.493
She'll win. She always does.

18:05.527 --> 18:07.756
This is your life,
Tangey, not hers.

18:08.817 --> 18:09.817
Do it your way.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.350
Hey, Wyatt, I just wanna say

18:20.383 --> 18:23.611
I'm really, really sorry
about this morning.

18:23.622 --> 18:25.192
We moved on. You got your
lines down for this one?

18:25.215 --> 18:27.225
Yeah, totally. Frontwards
and backwards.

18:27.259 --> 18:28.903
Then we won't have any problems.

18:30.533 --> 18:32.741
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

18:32.772 --> 18:35.285
I just have cast alerts
on everybody and...

18:35.659 --> 18:38.403
- 'God!'
- Is there a problem?

18:39.122 --> 18:41.081
Alexis isn't sick.

18:41.715 --> 18:43.848
She's in Palm Springs with Jake.

18:44.553 --> 18:47.245
- Who the hell is Jake?
- He's my friend. Um...

18:48.658 --> 18:49.658
Of course, he is.

18:51.107 --> 18:54.591
What... What just happened?

18:54.621 --> 18:57.741
Yeah, Wyatt's kinda got
a thing for Alexis.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.120
Probably shouldn't talk about

19:00.165 --> 19:01.575
when she hooks up
with other dudes.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.219
Why aren't we rolling?
Let's move, people.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.243
I-I'm ready.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.974
Uh, where's the actor
playing Makesh?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.660
I just-I haven't met him yet.

19:09.661 --> 19:11.621
Makesh will be CGI'd in later.

19:11.662 --> 19:14.757
So then who am I acting with?

19:14.789 --> 19:17.921
Yourself. Alright, let's go.
We're jumping right in.

19:17.922 --> 19:20.396
We have to make up for the
time you lost us this morning.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.437
'Rolling! Rolling!'

19:25.521 --> 19:27.676
And action!

19:28.109 --> 19:29.808
You told me it was possible.

19:29.891 --> 19:32.817
You made me trust you
and then you lied.

19:32.907 --> 19:34.417
- Cut.
- 'What?'

19:34.449 --> 19:36.269
Sorry, wasn't that my line?

19:36.301 --> 19:38.011
You're, uh, lookin' down
at his feet, not his head.

19:38.028 --> 19:39.908
Can someone please
show Miss Townsen

19:39.938 --> 19:41.260
where Makesh's head is?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.052
Oh.

19:44.886 --> 19:46.896
Oh, that's his head.

19:47.039 --> 19:49.164
'Cause it's round, it's... Uh...

19:49.672 --> 19:51.948
I got it. I see. I'm sorry.

19:51.949 --> 19:54.631
Do you mind just holding
it, like, steadier?

19:54.818 --> 19:57.182
- 'Roll sound.'
- 'And action.'

19:57.207 --> 19:59.527
'I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry, Wyatt'

19:59.559 --> 20:02.245
but does anybody mind, just
standing in for the broom?

20:02.270 --> 20:03.440
'I think it would really help... '

20:03.462 --> 20:04.422
That's not the way it works

20:04.456 --> 20:06.852
for the love of God.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.325
Stand there and just
say your lines.

20:11.009 --> 20:11.933
And action.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.808
You told me it was possible.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.466
Cut! You're way off your mark.
Damn it!

20:17.699 --> 20:18.859
Dude, you're killing us here.

20:20.590 --> 20:21.800
I'm sorry.

20:21.825 --> 20:24.555
We hired you because you
seemed to have genuine talent

20:24.613 --> 20:26.838
but what I've seen here
today has been abysmal.

20:27.286 --> 20:29.480
You held up the crew and
you delayed production.

20:29.894 --> 20:32.104
If you don't show up tomorrow.

20:32.129 --> 20:34.479
Ready to deliver the
performance of a lifetime

20:34.809 --> 20:36.569
then don't show up at all.

20:47.263 --> 20:48.613
Who died?

20:49.062 --> 20:50.062
I asked Paige out.

20:52.243 --> 20:53.243
She said no.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.795
I gave her a necklace
and she gave it back.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.818
You gave her the necklace
with her initial?

20:58.959 --> 20:59.796
Yeah.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.265
I thought you said
she was special.

21:01.763 --> 21:02.763
She is.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.891
Well, then maybe, you
need some new material.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.859
I'm so stupid. I'm
gonna call her.

21:12.860 --> 21:15.406
Are you sure starting a new thing
with her is such a good idea?

21:16.103 --> 21:17.348
Maybe this time you
should get to know her

21:17.372 --> 21:18.712
first before movin' in so fast.

21:18.751 --> 21:21.456
Try just... being her co-star

21:22.165 --> 21:23.443
and see how that goes.

21:31.781 --> 21:33.311
Yeah, Nina. Um...

21:34.086 --> 21:36.697
Yeah, Wyatt made that
very clear and...

21:39.133 --> 21:40.683
I'm so sorry, Nina.

21:40.718 --> 21:42.668
I promise I'll be so much
better tomorrow and...

21:44.146 --> 21:47.110
Hello? Hey... Nina?

21:51.935 --> 21:52.935
How bad?

21:55.308 --> 21:57.784
Twenty five thousand
dollars over budget bad.

21:58.174 --> 21:59.560
All because of me.

22:00.921 --> 22:02.851
Okay, so today wasn't great
on the acting front.

22:04.472 --> 22:07.171
Not great doesn't even
begin to cover it.

22:08.305 --> 22:11.281
Wyatt basically said I'm fired

22:11.305 --> 22:13.482
if I don't show up and
nail it tomorrow.

22:13.522 --> 22:16.809
Come on, how is anyone supposed
to act with a tennis ball?

22:16.898 --> 22:18.899
It's my job to be prepared

22:19.651 --> 22:23.211
and... I obviously wasn't.

22:23.539 --> 22:25.179
This thing with
Alexis doesn't help.

22:25.216 --> 22:26.758
Jake and I need to talk.

22:28.311 --> 22:29.549
And you will.

22:30.477 --> 22:33.368
But for now let's just
circle back to Rainer.

22:34.707 --> 22:37.823
Are you having any regrets
about turning him down?

22:38.109 --> 22:40.858
I mean, you said it yourself
he's a player and...

22:41.830 --> 22:43.613
No, I'm not gonna
let him use me.

22:44.387 --> 22:45.387
Good for you.

22:47.288 --> 22:49.677
No, I'm serious. I am
very proud of you.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.104
So, to you.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.469
To us.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.736
Another short day on
set for you, huh?

23:10.133 --> 23:12.380
What can I say? I
get in and out.

23:12.928 --> 23:13.928
Have you seen Paige yet?

23:14.671 --> 23:15.671
No.

23:16.647 --> 23:17.965
I'm kinda nervous too.

23:17.999 --> 23:19.265
I'll take a moment

23:19.616 --> 23:21.856
you know, before you shoot and
just tell her you're sorry

23:21.877 --> 23:23.791
and that you'll
put this on hold.

23:25.038 --> 23:27.198
You haven't been single
for a while, have you?

23:27.819 --> 23:29.147
It'll be a first.

23:29.429 --> 23:31.099
- I'll see you around.
- Later.

23:31.139 --> 23:32.139
By the way...

23:34.609 --> 23:35.769
I'm cool with you and Tangey.

23:36.970 --> 23:38.020
Huh?

23:40.788 --> 23:42.708
If there's something there,
you should go for it.

23:47.939 --> 23:49.536
Her trailer's right down here.

23:49.537 --> 23:51.629
Paige's BFF, Cassie, right?

23:51.930 --> 23:54.221
Uh, yeah, yeah,
that's my full name.

23:57.626 --> 23:58.666
So what's your deal?

23:58.703 --> 24:00.345
Set-PA Adam

24:01.139 --> 24:02.431
at your service.

24:02.923 --> 24:03.959
Noted.

24:04.217 --> 24:06.217
Well, I'll see you around

24:06.631 --> 24:07.631
PA Adam.

24:09.352 --> 24:11.672
♪ Keep it moving baby ♪

24:11.703 --> 24:14.373

24:14.406 --> 24:15.656

Are you kidding me?

24:19.492 --> 24:21.990
- This is all yours?
- Crazy, right?

24:22.021 --> 24:23.181
- Is that a bathroom?
- Yeah.

24:23.214 --> 24:24.427
You could basically
live in here.

24:24.451 --> 24:25.991
Yeah, but I miss you.

24:26.028 --> 24:27.718
Okay, fine, I'll live here too.

24:30.115 --> 24:31.515
Get out, there's
more food in here

24:31.551 --> 24:33.251
than we get after a Costco run.

24:33.285 --> 24:34.771
Take anything you want.
Seriously.

24:34.803 --> 24:37.530
I'm just in the middle of
looking over my script again.

24:37.555 --> 24:39.455
I cannot afford
to mess up today.

24:39.782 --> 24:40.866
You won't.

24:40.955 --> 24:42.931
I blame yesterday on Alexis.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.266
'By the way, she
tweeted this morning'

24:45.301 --> 24:48.171
how the desert air is
healing her sinuses.

24:48.204 --> 24:50.717
- Totally covered her ass.
- That's such a lie.

24:50.772 --> 24:54.137
I know, right? You know what,
I'm gonna call her out.

24:54.627 --> 24:55.850
What are you doing?

24:56.136 --> 24:57.897
I'm starting a Twitter war.

24:57.912 --> 24:59.451
'Don't worry, she won't
know it's me, I have, like'

24:59.475 --> 25:01.205
'seven fake accounts.'

25:01.243 --> 25:02.893
Unless you don't want me to.

25:04.655 --> 25:06.693
You know what? Tweet away.
She deserves it.

25:06.710 --> 25:08.470
I still can't believe
Jake is with her.

25:08.512 --> 25:11.547
Okay, I gotta ask. What's
really bugging you here?

25:11.596 --> 25:13.249
Jake being with Alexis

25:13.258 --> 25:15.794
or Jake being with
someone other than you?

25:15.819 --> 25:17.979
See, that's the thing, that's
what I was trying to figure out

25:17.995 --> 25:20.107
and all last night I just kept

25:20.586 --> 25:22.727
staring at that photo of them

25:22.764 --> 25:23.908
and, uh...

25:24.597 --> 25:26.107
God, I was just so
jealous of her.

25:26.141 --> 25:27.891
I wanted to be her

25:27.926 --> 25:30.090
'and that doesn't
even make sense.'

25:30.554 --> 25:33.224
Plus, I really need to
get my head in the game.

25:33.256 --> 25:35.621
- So your next scene is with...
- Rainer.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.755
Oh, I haven't even seen him
since I turned him down

25:38.778 --> 25:40.748
so I hope it's not awkward.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.920
No, no, I'm sure his ego
isn't damaged at all

25:43.959 --> 25:46.139
after being turned down for
the first time in his life

25:46.169 --> 25:48.102
'by his neophyte co-star.'

25:49.605 --> 25:52.956
Okay, I'm gonna look over
the script one last time.

25:54.872 --> 25:56.870
_

25:56.941 --> 25:58.731
Oh, I totally forgot.

25:58.768 --> 26:01.281
I have to turn in my
bio research paper.

26:01.838 --> 26:03.638
What? Cass, I thought you
were gonna stay all day.

26:03.656 --> 26:05.436
- Can you just e-mail it?
- No.

26:05.475 --> 26:07.945
My professor's old school.
He wants a hard copy.

26:07.985 --> 26:10.505
But I will be back as
soon as I can, promise.

26:12.595 --> 26:13.595
Okay.

26:13.745 --> 26:14.745
'Love you.'

26:18.792 --> 26:19.977
'If you don't pay by tomorrow'

26:20.001 --> 26:21.328
'your course load
will be dropped'

26:21.352 --> 26:23.132
'and your credits for
the term deleted.'

26:23.171 --> 26:25.931
But this is only my first
final notice bill.

26:25.974 --> 26:28.922
'I'm sorry, Ms. Perkins.
Payment is due by tomorrow.'

26:29.461 --> 26:31.321
That felt good, guys!

26:31.862 --> 26:33.252
Let's take 10.

26:33.325 --> 26:34.805
The traffic was terrible

26:34.835 --> 26:36.492
but I got back sooner
than I thought.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.201
Everybody, get back out there

26:39.239 --> 26:41.029
'cause I need to hear it
again, take it from the top.

26:41.050 --> 26:42.544
Oh, we already know it. We
just did a run-through.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.374
It sounded flat as I walked in.

26:44.399 --> 26:46.939
- I need to hear it again.
- Trust me, I-it's fine.

26:47.116 --> 26:49.466
It'll be fine when
I say it's fine.

26:49.502 --> 26:51.492
Tangey, this is a big debut

26:51.529 --> 26:53.209
and I cannot have
you half-assin' it.

26:53.247 --> 26:54.957
Ma, it's my music.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.938
And I run the show.

26:57.511 --> 26:58.681
From the the top

26:58.900 --> 26:59.900
now.

27:09.317 --> 27:11.597
Ah, just the person
I was looking for.

27:11.635 --> 27:13.645
Hey, Rainer, uh...

27:13.688 --> 27:15.738
Are you headed to
hair and makeup?

27:15.773 --> 27:18.890
Yeah, but I thought we
should talk privately first.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.710
- I want to apologize.
- No, please, don't.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.210
I'm, I'm sorry.

27:28.261 --> 27:30.631
If I said anything that
sounded rude or...

27:30.663 --> 27:31.663
No.

27:33.991 --> 27:36.861
Honestly, I-I wasn't even aware

27:36.894 --> 27:39.940
that the letter
necklace was my thing.

27:39.965 --> 27:43.434
Ah! I'm doin' that thing again
where I'm looking for excuses.

27:45.411 --> 27:47.791
I-I'll keep going
if it's working.

27:48.305 --> 27:49.715
I don't know. Try me.

27:51.509 --> 27:53.199
I was a working child actor

27:53.235 --> 27:55.745
so I never had a best
friend, I was lonely

27:55.786 --> 27:57.623
my dad died when I was a baby.

27:58.532 --> 28:01.424
- Is all that true?
- Tragically, yes.

28:03.521 --> 28:06.482
But that's no excuse
for how I treated you.

28:07.182 --> 28:09.440
So, I get why you
turned me down.

28:10.423 --> 28:13.002
But I just need to know if
you'll give me another chance.

28:13.030 --> 28:16.524
No. I mean, uh, yes, but...

28:16.834 --> 28:19.703
No, not, like, right now.

28:20.307 --> 28:23.146
You know maybe after
the movie wraps.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.489
Sounds like you're
turning me down again.

28:28.319 --> 28:29.779
Look, I really wanna have

28:29.817 --> 28:31.761
a great working
relationship together

28:31.855 --> 28:36.610
and, you know, I also wanna
make an amazing movie together.

28:36.665 --> 28:37.725
Me too.

28:39.488 --> 28:41.703
So, fresh start?

28:42.475 --> 28:43.618
Fresh start.

28:56.571 --> 28:58.203
'Oh, there she is.'

28:58.267 --> 29:01.651
One of my last customers who
hasn't left me for Craigslist.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.660
- How you doin', Cassie?
- Good. Hi, Dennis.

29:05.310 --> 29:08.214
- Did the watch sell?
- Thirty bucks.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.418
Got a check right here for you.

29:10.889 --> 29:13.037
- Only 30?
- Sorry.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.718
I thought we saw the last
of your mother's things

29:15.738 --> 29:17.438
when you pawned
that jade necklace?

29:17.831 --> 29:20.211
I... found something else.

29:27.439 --> 29:28.439
'Are you sure?'

29:32.755 --> 29:35.085
'Fresh off her Never Lie tour'

29:35.124 --> 29:36.905
'back with her
all-new single...'

29:36.959 --> 29:39.181
You make sure you control
your pitch on the high notes

29:39.220 --> 29:40.704
and give it energy.

29:40.705 --> 29:44.025
'Please welcome Tangey Turner!'

29:46.229 --> 29:47.229
And smile!

29:56.140 --> 29:58.140
Thank you, I'm
gonna do something

29:58.184 --> 29:59.114
a little different
for you today.

29:59.150 --> 30:00.500
'I hope you like it.'

30:03.413 --> 30:04.723
Thank you.

30:04.756 --> 30:05.746
'I love you!'

30:05.774 --> 30:06.924
I love you too.

that I made a mistake,
just save it.

30:53.773 --> 30:56.687
This song already has
400,000 likes on YouTube.

30:56.891 --> 30:58.507
Four hundred thousand?

30:58.837 --> 31:01.515
- Impressive.
- See, I told you.

31:01.589 --> 31:03.109
It's a great song.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.437
Mom, my fans are gonna love it.

31:05.469 --> 31:07.362
God, they're gonna follow me.
You'll see.

31:07.363 --> 31:10.549
Do you have any
idea how hard it is

31:11.139 --> 31:13.079
to be a black country artist?

31:13.222 --> 31:15.762
'Hasn't been one on the
charts since Darius Rucker.'

31:15.963 --> 31:18.323
And there's never been
a successful woman.

31:18.765 --> 31:19.808
'If you'd asked me'

31:20.039 --> 31:21.039
I would have told you.

31:23.690 --> 31:25.596
'You have no idea'

31:25.997 --> 31:27.891
how hard I work as your manager.

31:27.925 --> 31:29.910
'You think because you
put on a cowboy hat'

31:29.991 --> 31:31.433
and work out some lyrics

31:31.652 --> 31:33.294
you could reroute a career?

31:33.897 --> 31:36.312
Something like this,
Tangey, could end it.

31:38.462 --> 31:40.867
So this little experiment

31:41.547 --> 31:43.531
this little dream of yours

31:43.686 --> 31:44.881
is over.

31:47.251 --> 31:49.666
All I ever want is
support from you

31:50.138 --> 31:52.022
but all I ever get are lectures.

31:52.865 --> 31:55.373
My whole life, we've
done it your way.

31:56.310 --> 31:58.630
Not anymore. No.

31:58.671 --> 32:00.161
No, now we're doing it my way.

32:04.694 --> 32:05.794
You're fired.

32:09.724 --> 32:12.634
Okay, so then I tweeted
how her last movie bombed

32:12.669 --> 32:15.029
and then she tweeted
that I was a nobody hack

32:15.071 --> 32:17.001
and then I tweeted
how everyone knows

32:17.031 --> 32:18.601
she isn't even sick.

32:18.935 --> 32:20.773
Paige, are you
hearing any of this?

32:20.802 --> 32:23.702
What? Sorry, uh, big
scene coming up.

32:24.002 --> 32:25.072
You're gonna be great.

32:25.369 --> 32:27.217
And it's good, right, that you
and Rainer cleared the air

32:27.241 --> 32:29.017
before the big kissing scene.

32:30.020 --> 32:32.491
Yeah, we're totally good.

32:32.530 --> 32:36.990
Um, I just, I really need to
stay focused on the movie

32:37.026 --> 32:40.326
and get that picture of Jake
and Alexis out of my head

32:40.363 --> 32:43.402
and stop thinking about that
he won't even text me back.

32:43.446 --> 32:45.226
- Oh, my God.
- What?

32:47.884 --> 32:50.338
- Her last tweet.
- 'Ew!'

32:50.373 --> 32:51.923
'I don't understand
what he sees in her.'

32:51.941 --> 32:54.121
- 'She's so fake.'
- She's the worst.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.840
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

32:55.862 --> 32:58.232
It's happening again. Get
that photo away from me.

32:58.263 --> 32:59.953
I just, I need to focus
and stop letting

32:59.991 --> 33:02.021

'You sure are handy to

33:47.741 --> 33:49.901
Try to be. Uh, here we are.

33:50.106 --> 33:51.356
Oh, my God.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.091
'I can't believe I'm on
the set of "Locked."'

33:54.115 --> 33:55.115
'This is amazing.'

33:55.585 --> 33:57.015
And it's so real, I
mean, it's, like, fake

33:57.036 --> 33:59.086
but it's, like, real fake.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.551
You, you know what I mean?

34:00.581 --> 34:02.302
The magic of making movies.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.878
So this is us. Um,
they're about to start.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.408
Please sit here.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.275
'Everybody, scene 32 is up.'

34:21.844 --> 34:23.687
'First team, places.'

34:24.520 --> 34:25.628
Thanks, Adam.

34:36.417 --> 34:37.467
'Rolling!'

34:37.509 --> 34:38.759
You're gonna do great.

34:41.554 --> 34:43.371
Alright, roll, sound.

34:44.050 --> 34:46.065
- 'Background.'
- And action.

34:46.271 --> 34:47.721
Last night, that...

34:50.822 --> 34:52.797
That wasn't our beginning.

34:54.077 --> 34:55.632
That was our goodbye, wasn't it?

34:55.634 --> 34:57.527
This isn't what you
were meant for, August.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.560
It's not what I want for you.

34:59.909 --> 35:00.909
Hey.

35:05.295 --> 35:08.965
How could you say all those
things to me yesterday, huh?

35:08.999 --> 35:11.250
How could you make
me believe that...

35:12.011 --> 35:13.922
We were gonna have
this future together?

35:17.034 --> 35:18.594
I need you to go back
to your own time.

35:21.142 --> 35:23.187
I can't be responsible
for keeping you here.

35:23.188 --> 35:26.863
But what I want
does that matter?

35:27.481 --> 35:29.206
What do you want, August?

35:30.496 --> 35:31.496
I want you.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.457
And cut!

35:46.748 --> 35:48.607
'Uh, that's cut, guys.'

35:51.532 --> 35:54.140
Finally, the girl from
the audition shows up.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.816
Great stuff, both of you.

35:57.505 --> 35:59.794
- We're moving on, people.
- 'Alright.'

35:59.819 --> 36:01.599
'No, that's not a reset,
let's move it on.'

36:15.822 --> 36:18.947
Do you wanna explain to me
what just happened out there?

36:18.978 --> 36:20.683
I was acting.

36:21.139 --> 36:24.659
Oh, okay, I love you and
I am your biggest fan

36:24.660 --> 36:27.397
but Meryl Streep couldn't have
made that feel more real.

36:30.803 --> 36:33.260
I know you, Paige Townsen.
You can't lie to me.

36:33.646 --> 36:35.287
What I saw out there is
two people who really

36:35.311 --> 36:36.906
like each other.

36:38.324 --> 36:39.603
I was wrong about Jake.

36:40.225 --> 36:41.495
Leave the tags on the Dolce

36:41.535 --> 36:43.284
and follow this
thing with Rainer.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.942
So Meryl Streep, huh?

36:47.980 --> 36:50.292
Yeah, you should
probably start working

36:50.317 --> 36:51.817
on your Oscar speech.

36:53.057 --> 36:56.051
Hey, where did the bracelet go?

36:56.751 --> 36:58.791
I took it to the jeweler,
it was a little bit big

36:58.828 --> 37:01.089
and I didn't want it
to slip off the wrist.

37:01.690 --> 37:03.682
Yeah. You definitely
don't want that.

37:03.716 --> 37:06.296
'Okay, I'm going to,
uh, get changed'

37:06.327 --> 37:08.741
'and then I'll see you at home.'

37:08.789 --> 37:09.789
Okay.

37:12.384 --> 37:13.875
Hey, hey.

37:15.245 --> 37:16.245
Oh...

37:17.345 --> 37:19.066
I-I just wanted to say...

37:20.372 --> 37:22.043
Wow, that was a great scene.

37:22.556 --> 37:24.056
You did an amazing job.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.071
Thanks. You too.

37:28.939 --> 37:31.003
So what're you, uh,
what're you doing now?

37:31.275 --> 37:34.325
- Going home.
- We could grab a drink first.

37:34.362 --> 37:36.897
Ah, I'm really exhausted.

37:38.935 --> 37:40.535
Huh. Just one then...

37:40.569 --> 37:42.400
You really don't take no
for an answer, do you?

37:42.401 --> 37:45.154
Come on, Paige. You felt it.

37:46.339 --> 37:47.429
I know you did.

37:49.152 --> 37:51.612
- Felt what?
- The chemistry.

37:51.647 --> 37:53.403
- That kiss, it was...
- Acting?

37:54.590 --> 37:57.140
Yesterday, I did a
really moving scene

37:57.177 --> 37:58.357
with a tennis ball.

37:58.957 --> 38:00.248
Wait till you see it.
