WEBVTT

00:08.049 --> 00:10.177
<i>Previously on You, Me, Her...</i>

00:10.218 --> 00:11.595
You do it with someone you don't know--

00:11.637 --> 00:14.431
someone who doesn't laugh when you get your sexy on.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.599
I'm talking about an escort.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.643
Jack Trakarsky.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.978
I'm Izzy Silva.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.103
I met Izzy today.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.355
We made out.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.524
After she gave me a foot job under the table.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.859
I kind of feel like I'm dangling my marriage

00:24.900 --> 00:27.736
out a 10-storey window right now.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.196
Weinstock is retiring as Dean.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.281
He's recommending me as his replacement.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.366
Izzy's an escort. You don't have to end things.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.202
You just don't call them again.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.037
Mom! What are you doing?

00:43.002 --> 00:44.545
: Hi.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.630
Hi.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.521
I can't feel my hands,

01:02.563 --> 01:04.523
or my feet, or the top of my head.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.941
Do I smell baked goods?

01:05.983 --> 01:07.275
Does that mean I'm having a stroke?

01:07.317 --> 01:08.485
It's a candle.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.237
"Pumpkin Spice."

01:10.278 --> 01:11.405
A stroke is burnt toast.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.240
That's good to know, thank you.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.785
Just the three of us here, now, first time, together,

01:16.827 --> 01:18.245
in close proximity.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.414
Kinda...

01:20.455 --> 01:21.916
kinda takes it to the next level.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.170
Yeah. Um...

01:27.212 --> 01:28.756
I sprinted away

01:28.797 --> 01:30.966
from a date with an amazing guy,

01:31.008 --> 01:32.634
cyber-stalked your home address,

01:32.676 --> 01:34.469
and just barely escaped

01:34.511 --> 01:36.764
the warning screams of my inner critic.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.765
This is nice here.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.182
I like your house.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.183
We were just talking about you,

01:40.225 --> 01:41.435
literally two seconds

01:41.476 --> 01:42.728
before you knocked on the door.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.312
It's, like, strange.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.439
That's so sweet.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.607
And weird.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.734
So how long

01:48.776 --> 01:50.736
am I gonna be chained up in your basement?

01:50.778 --> 01:53.488
I'm mostly free until midterms in December, so.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.951
She does that.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.536
Well, you know, Jack's made it real cozy down there.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.121
Fridge, mini-bar, couch.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.122
Good. I'm in.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.331
: We have Quaaludes down there

02:03.373 --> 02:05.375
which will erode your sense of time,

02:05.417 --> 02:07.127
if that's your thing.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.423
This is so not us.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.592
We've never done anything like this before.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.512
Haven't dusted off that line since college.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.764
Honey, you used that line on me.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.181
Don't-- Don't obsess.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.725
Man, I am really nervous.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.228
Is my voice as shaky as it sounds in my head?

02:25.270 --> 02:26.396
Did someone mention Quaaludes?

02:26.438 --> 02:27.397
Yeah, I was joking. Oh, sorry.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.399
Yeah, we don't--

02:29.441 --> 02:30.442
we don't have any sedatives.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.652
We have a lot of good wine.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.194
Yeah, a case of wine

02:33.236 --> 02:35.656
that we got at this fantastic little vineyard.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.949
It was beautiful.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.283
In Northern California.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.284
It's perfect--

02:39.326 --> 02:40.368
We should really go.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.662
We had a really nice time there.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.038
We kind of have some of that.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.081
It's delicious. Made of grapes.

02:44.123 --> 02:45.666
Yes.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.209
All right, let's pop some corks, dickheads.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.962
Do we look like dickheads?

02:50.004 --> 02:51.797
I think she meant that affectionately.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.507
This should do.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.758
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no. -Not those.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.843
: They're not really for drinking.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.844
They're for show.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.356
: Well, I'd summarize it like this--

03:09.397 --> 03:11.608
we, that is, Jack and I,

03:11.650 --> 03:12.985
have crossed a threshold

03:13.027 --> 03:15.029
into a unique marital dimension--

03:15.070 --> 03:18.573
Speaking of talking like we're high--

03:18.615 --> 03:20.034
Oh, when I get just the right combination

03:20.075 --> 03:21.576
of nervous and inebriated,

03:21.618 --> 03:24.079
I get grandiloquent and orotund

03:24.121 --> 03:25.204
and I use words that nobody uses,

03:25.246 --> 03:26.373
and then I try and negate it

03:26.414 --> 03:28.083
with a disarming self-awareness--

03:28.125 --> 03:30.627
Um, after that,

03:30.669 --> 03:32.546
I have to insist.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.882
This is a gentle, well-intentioned Indica.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.466
Indi

03:36.508 --> 03:38.010
Indica.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.846
No minds will be blown.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.597
The best kind of pot you can find.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.598
Oh, it's weed?

03:51.648 --> 03:56.195
If you were to create "A Good Guy" in a lab...

03:56.236 --> 03:59.322
that's what I left on a barstool.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.200
How fucked up is that?

04:01.241 --> 04:04.494
Should we talk about your obvious commitment issues?

04:04.536 --> 04:06.747
Shall we revisit what I told you last time?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.082
Blow me?

04:12.544 --> 04:15.296
Why do we talk about Izzy all the time?

04:15.338 --> 04:18.383
Why did she impulsively come over?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.803
Why are we doing whatever it is we're doing?

04:21.845 --> 04:23.972
Why, why, why, why...

04:24.014 --> 04:25.599
why?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.393
The house of why.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.441
You got the hiccups?

04:34.482 --> 04:35.525
I get stoned super easy these days.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.568
Have you noticed?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.780
I keep replaying what happened in that bar.

04:39.821 --> 04:43.158
I pleasured myself at my desk, thinking of you.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.327
You didn't

04:46.369 --> 04:48.163
I did.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.539
Emma...

04:49.581 --> 04:52.876
We both masturbated at our respective workplaces.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.003
You didn't?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.214
And now we're sitting here in our living room telling you.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.757
This isn't weird at all.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.758
: Are you freaked out?

04:59.800 --> 05:00.926
You must be so freaked out.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.095
You can run. We won't tackle you.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.345
No. No, no, no.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.140
I am-- I am way too insecure

05:06.181 --> 05:08.683
to feel anything but flattered

05:08.725 --> 05:11.103
that anybody would jack off to me.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.855
Guys, I need you to know

05:13.897 --> 05:17.525
that I, like, have done nothing but think about you.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.779
I have tried to wash it away

05:20.821 --> 05:22.322
with-- with booze

05:22.363 --> 05:24.532
and-- and cleaning products,

05:24.574 --> 05:27.368
but you guys are stubborn.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.954
Like a stain.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.580
Like a... like a beautiful stain.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.083
Very handsome...

05:33.125 --> 05:35.710
handsome...

05:35.752 --> 05:36.920
stain.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.723
Yeah, but we agree that this is a business arrangement, right?

05:53.394 --> 05:55.230
Yeah. Of course.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.774
Abso-fucking-lutely.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.776
Yeah. Rent doesn't pay itself.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.945
: She's like our mutual hall pass.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.280
: Yeah.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.032
Yeah, we each get two sessions a week with her?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.449
I mean-- I mean, you.

06:08.869 --> 06:09.995
Thank you for remembering

06:10.037 --> 06:12.956
that I'm both present and a human being.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.541
We could just book her for the whole month

06:14.582 --> 06:15.542
and then we can revisit it... Yeah.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.585
...at that point.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.257
Okay, so...

06:22.299 --> 06:23.925
here's my deal--

06:23.967 --> 06:26.011
I'm probably gonna be shutting down a lot of regulars,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.304
I'll probably lose a few,

06:27.346 --> 06:29.723
so I'm gonna have to charge you guys a premium.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.474
Oh, and I'm gonna have to get you guys

06:31.516 --> 06:33.185
to pay the month in advance

06:33.227 --> 06:35.270
to hold Mondays through Thursdays,

06:35.312 --> 06:38.773
'cause weekends are for non-paying relationships only.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.817
We good?

06:40.859 --> 06:43.695
I'm good. You good, Em?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.197
Yeah, but we agree

06:45.239 --> 06:49.576
that the intimacy is, like, non

06:49.617 --> 06:52.537
Okay, so if that's that,

06:52.579 --> 06:55.749
does anyone want to write up a formal contract,

06:55.790 --> 06:59.418
or will a spirited round of businessman handshakes suffice?

07:02.463 --> 07:05.008
There's my ride at the corner, so I'm gonna fly.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.720
Mr. Trakarsky.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.513
Mrs. Trakarsky.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.556
It's been a fucking slice.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.147
Did she leave?

07:19.189 --> 07:20.274
Yeah.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.316
She took the weed.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.531
I know I started it,

07:28.573 --> 07:29.866
but I really think we got too business-ey

07:29.908 --> 07:30.867
with Izzy last night.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.161
Objectified her. Hurt her feelings.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.746
Honey, she is an escort

07:34.788 --> 07:36.373
and we are her clients,

07:36.415 --> 07:37.958
so the whole situation

07:37.999 --> 07:39.459
is inherently business-ey.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.253
I just think we need to set clear boundaries, you know,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.422
and make sure this whole thing doesn't spin out of control.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.133
You mean so one of us

07:46.174 --> 07:47.301
doesn't develop feelings for another?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.136
Maybe.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.513
Has one of us already developed feelings for another?

07:52.555 --> 07:53.932
No.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.434
I saw those googly eyes you were giving her last night.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.684
Googly eyes?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.228
Those are my stoned eyes.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.605
I totally know the difference, and those were googly eyes.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.773
I know your stoned eyes.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.774
I'm telling you,

08:02.816 --> 08:04.025
all throughout college,

08:04.067 --> 08:05.277
people were like, "Hey, are you hitting on me?"

08:05.319 --> 08:06.236
I was like, "No, I'm just super high over here."

08:06.278 --> 08:07.195
-That is not true. -It is true.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.447
I don't believe that.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.824
Were they red But squinty?

08:10.865 --> 08:11.950
I know your googly eyes.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
That's not it, okay, so stop saying it.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.745
I don't know why I have to defend myself.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.747
I just think it's better for all of us

08:17.789 --> 08:19.082
if we have it

08:19.124 --> 08:20.667
as a clearly defined business arrangement, okay?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.336
Payment for services rendered.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.378
Okay.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.545
Right.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.798
So how do we decide who gets her first?

08:27.924 --> 08:29.384
-Ew. -Yeah.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.428
Ew. That sounded bad.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.221
I just grossed myself out.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.764
Just flip a coin?

08:36.266 --> 08:37.309
Rock

08:37.351 --> 08:38.559
You know what? I'm just gonna go first.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.602
How is that fair?

08:39.644 --> 08:40.687
Ladies first.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.230
There's two ladies in this situation.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.731
That's unfair. I will never get to go first.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.233
Like, ever.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.360
Once every three times, I guess,

08:46.401 --> 08:48.153
but... that's not enough.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.448
Should be 50/50. We should--

08:51.490 --> 08:54.368
Ladies... Oh, my. Hello.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.578
Is this... Uh-huh.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.622
Oh, my God.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.300
So we have a deal?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.426
I get to go first?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.053
Mm-hmm.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.221
You promise?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.763
No.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.057
Should I stop?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.766
Is this how we're gonna decide things from now on?

09:18.808 --> 09:19.934
Mm-hmm.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.478
Okay.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.979
Do you like it?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.439
I do, but I feel like I'm being short-sighted.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.358
Stupid penis.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.903
: Through the use of rational thought.

09:29.944 --> 09:30.904
But with sensory memory,

09:30.945 --> 09:32.822
the brain is designed

09:32.864 --> 09:34.991
only to process information that will be useful

09:35.033 --> 09:37.160
at a later date.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.870
Psst!

09:38.912 --> 09:40.788
Sorry. Sorry.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.960
You could meet me halfway and move your legs, dickface?

09:49.630 --> 09:50.965
Hi.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.430
I'm in class dressed like a horny WNBA player.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.098
You could at least ask.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.058
Kinda tells its own story, man.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.643
I had to Google an hour's worth of basketball jargon.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.354
In case it, like, ever comes up,

10:04.396 --> 10:05.480
there really isn't

10:05.522 --> 10:07.107
an hour's worth of basketball jargon,

10:07.148 --> 10:09.234
so I just started, like, making shit up.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.235
Yeah.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.278
Hey, can I borrow your notes?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.031
All yours.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.325
What have you been doing for the last 34 minutes?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.163
I honestly have no idea.

10:27.461 --> 10:31.465
I'm gonna need your notes, Stan. Two copies, bring 'em tomorrow?

10:31.506 --> 10:33.425
Sure. Absolutely.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.928
It's Kyle, by the way.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.474
But Stan works. Yeah.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.434
I can be Stan.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.271
Don't worry. Ken's got it.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.482
He just told you his name was Dan.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.857
What?

10:49.899 --> 10:50.984
Kyle.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.659
Sorry I'm late, Frank.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.660
College essays.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.828
My God, is it possible

11:01.869 --> 11:03.538
for every kid who has under a three-five

11:03.580 --> 11:04.914
to have ADHD

11:04.956 --> 11:06.874
and multiple deaths in the family?

11:06.916 --> 11:08.460
I miss the days

11:08.502 --> 11:10.086
when you still felt obligated to kiss my ass and call me Dean.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.712
You're in my fucking chair, Dean.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.381
Kiss my ass, Jack.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.466
Got it.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.550
I'm not even officially retired yet,

11:15.592 --> 11:18.386
and I'm already bored to fucking death.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.096
Hey,

11:20.138 --> 11:21.889
Now that I don't have to worry about testing,

11:21.931 --> 11:24.225
I'm really into the idea of trying out the new drugs.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.353
How does one "roll"?

11:26.394 --> 11:27.895
Wait. We have drug testing?

11:27.937 --> 11:28.896
Technically.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.273
I can't remember the last one.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.151
Okay, so the Alumni Board has all your records,

11:33.193 --> 11:34.444
they meet to discuss on Monday.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.571
Hey, can they really track my browser history?

11:36.613 --> 11:37.656
Like you were--

11:37.696 --> 11:39.574
'cause that seems...

11:39.616 --> 11:42.243
That seems un... un... like...

11:42.285 --> 11:43.411
Amer-- unethical or something.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.246
Or un-something. It's un-something.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.874
This is Hamilton, Jack, so, yeah, they're gonna dig...

11:47.915 --> 11:50.377
but seriously, you do use Incognito Mode?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.547
What's "Incognito Mode"?

11:53.588 --> 11:55.382
Oh, boy.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.307
: Hmm... what would I wear

12:04.349 --> 12:05.308
on a first date with a female

12:06.351 --> 12:07.810
grad-student- slash-escort

12:07.852 --> 12:10.188
I'm sharing with my husband?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.606
: Keep trying to be funny.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.192
It's irritating, but it distracts me.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.235
I'm so nervous,

12:15.276 --> 12:16.403
I couldn't go this morning.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.238
I feel like I'm pregnant.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.614
I have a poo baby.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.241
Do you and Jack talk a lot about your digestive issues?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.617
Because you should know the rest of us don't.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.660
See, for example,

12:23.702 --> 12:24.827
I don't need to know

12:24.869 --> 12:28.206
whether you pooped or not on any given day.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.708
What about this one?

12:29.748 --> 12:31.125
Hot. Yeah.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.877
If I were an underage groupie

12:32.919 --> 12:34.504
with deep-seated self-esteem issues,

12:34.546 --> 12:36.005
I'd buy out the whole shop.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.882
Yeah, let's go throw back some Jaeger shots

12:37.924 --> 12:39.718
and go to a "Modest Mouse" show, dude.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.761
God, even your young-chick references are old.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.138
Hey...

12:45.515 --> 12:47.350
How about that?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.687
Help me. Help me, help me, help me.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.146
Oh, chill.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.148
I'm sure lezzing is just like riding a bike.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.442
It'll come back to you.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.444
I haven't ridden a bike in so long.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.572
Listen, you wear that, I will totally lezinate you.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.115
Okay, you can stop trying to create

13:02.156 --> 13:04.409
different permutations of the word "lez" now.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
Wait a second

13:06.160 --> 13:07.746
Is that how lezitation works?

13:07.786 --> 13:10.957
It's my phone, jackass.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.293
-Aw... Izzy. -Dear God.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.920
Are you 13

13:15.962 --> 13:17.756
You're jealous, asshole.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.436
Retro fitness. I respect that.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.938
Fem Fit says this chick nailed it way back when.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.191
Everything you need in 15 minutes.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.526
Do you know where my vape is?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.527
I'm getting super stressed

13:39.569 --> 13:40.695
by my date with Emma.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.029
So they're getting

13:42.071 --> 13:43.740
some freaky version of sex therapy,

13:43.782 --> 13:45.032
but what're you getting out of it?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.285
Uh, 16 sessions paid upfront?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.162
It's on the table, Dingdong.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.289
Fem Fit also says

13:51.331 --> 13:52.415
habitual pot use

13:52.457 --> 13:53.667
causes degenerative ocular disease.

13:53.708 --> 13:54.751
Jesus, Fem Fit--

13:54.793 --> 13:57.003
your guide to a joyless fucking life.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.421
Should I wear these?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.549
Just don't.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.224
My God, I'm so nervous.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.561
I haven't been on a first date since...

14:13.603 --> 14:14.937
not since you.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.695
I'm not sure if you're ready for this,

14:21.736 --> 14:24.405
to be honest.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.407
I think I should probably go first.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.535
Yeah?

14:28.576 --> 14:29.869
Yeah, I think that's probably best.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.621
Really?

14:31.663 --> 14:33.832
No. Not really.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.999
Why do you make me go there? I hate the Matherfields!

14:36.209 --> 14:37.335
They play all those stupid games and...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.212
Well, one of us has to be there on time.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.923
Carmen said that Lori is making a special announcement.

14:42.965 --> 14:43.924
I'll be, like, an hour late.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.925
Wow, this is--

14:44.967 --> 14:46.344
I think that might be

14:46.386 --> 14:47.595
actually too hot.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.723
I think you might burn corneas.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.766
Ooh, that is-- that is good.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.023
Okay.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.943
What

15:02.985 --> 15:05.029
Because I want you to ravage me later.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.575
I mean, that's the plan, isn't it?

15:09.659 --> 15:10.827
I guess so.

15:19.669 --> 15:20.879
-Hey. -Hi.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.424
You look really nice.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.342
Thank you. So do you.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.136
Thank. I... Thanks.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.726
I think that...

15:34.768 --> 15:37.604
I think we should be able to get in soon, yeah.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.979
I'm scared shitless.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.231
Are you scared shitless?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.691
Yeah.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.484
I could order, but there's no way in hell I could eat.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.611
Me too. Good.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.779
I could drink.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.697
Me too. Always. I have an idea.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.452
I...

16:06.925 --> 16:08.134
It's a fucking game,

16:08.175 --> 16:09.469
so who the fuck gives a shit about these games?

16:09.510 --> 16:10.845
I love these games. What are you talking about?

16:10.887 --> 16:12.722
What is with you tonight? You seem very stressed.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.056
It's Emma.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.391
She's doing dinner with a colleague,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.518
and she's supposed to be done by now, that's all.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.061
That's what's stressing you out so much?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.313
You check your phone, like, every two seconds.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.314
Yeah, that's it.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.900
Okay. You want to play?

16:23.942 --> 16:24.943
Can we play the game now?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.026
I'd love to play, okay.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.197

16:30.239 --> 16:31.741

16:56.223 --> 16:57.684
You're riding a pony?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.435
Hah! Oh!

16:59.477 --> 17:00.728
A diaper. You're wearing a diaper?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.271
-No. -I feel like I'm getting close.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.359
Literally, that's what it's called.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.068
Oh, my God.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.407
That just totally exfoliated my mouth.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.951
I loved it.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.914
I should have got two.

17:19.956 --> 17:22.375
Are you insinuating I drink too much?

17:22.416 --> 17:23.710
No, I...

17:23.751 --> 17:24.878
'Cause I totally do.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.170
I'm not exactly working on it,

17:26.212 --> 17:27.922
but I'm thinking about working on it

17:27.964 --> 17:30.633
in the near future, I think, maybe, I don't know.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.072
Hot fucking damn.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.616
I know a place.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.035
A hotel?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.536
Better.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.749
Isn't it delicious?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.000
Shirley Temple. Shirley Temple.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.543
-No.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.878
You're the only person in the world who doesn't know this.

18:06.920 --> 18:07.879
Well, can you give me something else to work with?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.088
Give him another clue.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.172
I'm not giving him another clue.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.173
What are you, refusing clues?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.550
Say it.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.843
I don't know what it is.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.055
You're an idiot.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.723
First, thank you all for coming,

18:18.765 --> 18:20.224
but more importantly,

18:20.266 --> 18:21.726
I'm proud to announce

18:21.768 --> 18:24.520
that my beautiful and brilliant wife, Lori...

18:24.562 --> 18:27.565
has just accepted a seat

18:27.607 --> 18:32.236
on the prestigious Hamilton School Alumni Board!

18:32.278 --> 18:34.530
Thank you. Thank you all.

18:34.572 --> 18:35.990
You're so kind.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.408
Rest assured

18:37.450 --> 18:40.536
I take my new position very seriously.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.081
Okay, enough about me.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.458
I want you to enjoy the rest of the party.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.501
And, oh, we have devised

18:47.543 --> 18:49.796
an entirely new game

18:49.837 --> 18:52.131
that I think you all

18:52.172 --> 18:54.092
are going to be quite entertained by.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.551
More games?

18:55.593 --> 18:56.803
Okay, party!

18:56.844 --> 18:58.220
Party time! Come on!

18:58.262 --> 19:00.098
Thank you!

19:03.517 --> 19:04.936
-So... -There she is.

19:04.978 --> 19:05.937
How much ass-kissing can you squeeze

19:05.979 --> 19:06.938
into three days,

19:06.980 --> 19:09.899
Assistant Dean Trakarsky?

19:09.941 --> 19:11.567
Congratulations, by the way.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.193
Thank you!

19:13.235 --> 19:15.113
More Chardonnay, madame?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.405
Oh, definitely.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.869
: What?

19:21.911 --> 19:25.205
This is fucking amazing.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.125
: Told you.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.459
: You did good.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.877
: You like it: Yeah].

19:29.919 --> 19:31.504
: Good.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.049
Nice, huh?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.385
I was awake for hours last night

19:38.427 --> 19:39.720
thinking about

19:39.762 --> 19:41.639
a married couple in Hawthorne Heights

19:41.681 --> 19:45.018
sleeping in bed together without me.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.107
Oh, fuck. Did I scare you?

19:51.149 --> 19:52.692
No, no, no.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.735
Hold on. Just stay there.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.487
-Okay. -Stay there.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.741
: So I did a lot of homework,

20:00.783 --> 20:04.078
watched a lot of highly, highly disturbing videos,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.455
featuring a vast array of vegetables.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.875
It was... It was very upsetting.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.168
I think I saw a gourd,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.627
or it could have been an eggplant,

20:11.669 --> 20:13.212
like a large one,

20:13.253 --> 20:14.630
I don't know.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.591
Anyways, I didn't learn much.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.219
Please tell me there are no vegetables in there.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.144
Oh, my God, your laugh makes me so nervous.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.562
I could be sick.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.315
But in a good way. You're so fucking beautiful.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.582
Lyric

20:49.623 --> 20:51.333
That's what you came up with?

20:54.378 --> 20:55.337
: I've carried mounds of shame

20:55.379 --> 20:58.424
for 16 years now.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.508
"Mounds of Shame"

20:59.550 --> 21:01.594
is absolutely the name of my next band.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.804
You've been in bands?

21:03.846 --> 21:06.557
Did that turn you on?

21:08.642 --> 21:09.643
You okay?

21:32.499 --> 21:34.210
I love your eyes.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.713
They're, like, doe eyes,

21:37.755 --> 21:39.799
but you probably hear that a million times.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.217
No, I've never heard that before.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.803
Yeah, I bet every dude says that to you.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.181
Your lips are so soft.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.976
It feels so weird to-- You don't have a beard.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.145
Yeah, not yet at least.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.983
The beauty mark on your right cheek

21:57.024 --> 22:01.112
is the first thing that made me just go crazy for you.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.325
: I used to try and scratch it off.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.953
: That's dumb.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.955
Don't try to scratch it off.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.875
Okay. I won't.

22:14.917 --> 22:19.255
Shh. I think we just broke the no penetration rule.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.593
Okay, nobody this side of Bedrock

23:06.635 --> 23:07.636
snores like that.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.266
Let's get this stink bomb out of here.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.187
Yes.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.022
Look at you.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.148
Let the ravaging begin.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.025
Babe...

23:21.067 --> 23:23.027
I swear, if I come one more time,

23:23.069 --> 23:25.112
I think I'll dry up and blow away.

23:26.364 --> 23:27.698
I'm so tired.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.407
You serious?

23:29.449 --> 23:31.077
Mm-hmm.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.205
What the hell?

23:34.247 --> 23:35.455
How many orgasms are we talking about?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.166
I thought we had a no orgasm rule.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.292
I just thought we were, like...

23:39.960 --> 23:41.254
we were...

23:41.295 --> 23:42.462
this whole thing was so that we would bring it--

23:42.504 --> 23:44.257
We are doing this for us.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.008
Well, doesn't look like I'm getting anything out of it,

23:46.050 --> 23:48.177
at this point.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.686
What were you doing for three hours?

23:58.854 --> 24:01.439
Um, I don't know, we walked and talked,

24:01.481 --> 24:03.943
and we drank.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.155
And we went to the roof.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.448
Which roof?

24:11.992 --> 24:13.660
Are you talking about our roof?

24:14.995 --> 24:16.289
You took her to our roof?

24:16.330 --> 24:17.455
Oh, my God.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.958
I'm sorry.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.209
Oh, my God.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.754
No.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.172
Am I okay?

24:25.214 --> 24:27.800
How could you--

24:27.841 --> 24:29.760
There's a fucking million places you could have taken her--

24:29.802 --> 24:31.429
you took her there?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.976
It sounds so romantic.

24:37.017 --> 24:37.977
Babe, it's just new.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.104
It's a little confusing.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.023
I'll say. I am confused.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.445
Very confused about what, like--

24:49.529 --> 24:50.864
What about with Izzy, like, in particular?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.783
Is that something else?

24:52.825 --> 24:53.784
Izzy?

24:53.826 --> 24:54.827
Yes.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.079
Um...

24:59.623 --> 25:01.750
That...

25:01.792 --> 25:06.130
That is...

25:06.172 --> 25:07.840
That is a lot confusing.

25:10.717 --> 25:13.095
We promised we'd be honest, right?

25:13.137 --> 25:14.680
-Yeah... -We have to be honest.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.640
I know, It's just seeing you like this

25:16.682 --> 25:18.225
is freaking me out a bit.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.479
I'm being honest. That's my honesty.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.818
Let's bring on the honesty.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.279
It's really-- it's really working for me.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.408
Maybe a little jealousy's good for both of us.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.743
Maybe.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.084
Hey...

25:44.126 --> 25:45.543
you going to go to bed like that?

25:45.585 --> 25:46.628
Yes.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.546
-Yes.

25:48.588 --> 25:49.547
For real?

25:49.589 --> 25:50.966
I'm going to bed angry,

25:51.008 --> 25:52.968
'cause this is...

25:53.010 --> 25:54.345
I'm going to have a million orgasms on my date,

25:54.387 --> 25:55.346
I can't wait.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.389
-Yeah.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.555
What are you going to do on your date?

26:00.476 --> 26:02.019
Stop it. I'm trying to be angry.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.438
-It's going to be raining-- -I'm trying to be angry.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.255
Iz, can I--

27:17.553 --> 27:19.388
What are you doing?

27:19.430 --> 27:21.432
Sleeping.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.682
No, you're not.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.726
Yeah, I was.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.695
