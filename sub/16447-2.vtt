<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:12.024 --> 00:13.647
Hello.

00:13.649 --> 00:16.274
I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.507
May I ask what this is about?

00:18.509 --> 00:19.909
No, you may not.

00:19.911 --> 00:21.944
Very well.

00:24.082 --> 00:25.715
Hi... Colonel Williams.

00:25.717 --> 00:27.083
How can I help you?

00:27.085 --> 00:28.351
O-Okay.

00:28.353 --> 00:31.120
Sure, I can meet with you
on Thursday.

00:31.122 --> 00:32.521
Caltech is fine.

00:32.523 --> 00:34.991
Yeah, may I ask
what this is about?

00:34.993 --> 00:36.359
(brief chuckle)

00:36.361 --> 00:38.461
I may not?

00:38.463 --> 00:41.464
That's what he said to me.

00:42.633 --> 00:44.500
Look at this.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.603
Elon Musk has a theory
that we're all just characters

00:47.605 --> 00:50.740
in some advanced civilization's
video game.

00:50.742 --> 00:52.641
So some alien kid spent
his money

00:52.643 --> 00:56.012
on the asthma-and-glasses
upgrade for me?

00:57.248 --> 01:01.017
Well, he doesn't say
it's a good game.

01:01.886 --> 01:03.853
All right, we got a problem.

01:03.855 --> 01:04.675
What's up?

01:04.699 --> 01:07.254
The Air Force contacted me
about our quantum gyroscope.

01:07.354 --> 01:08.184
They want to have
a meeting.

01:08.208 --> 01:08.792
Really?

01:08.793 --> 01:10.926
Yeah. This military guy
showed up at Howard's door.

01:10.928 --> 01:12.428
He was terrifying.

01:12.430 --> 01:13.763
Oh, what did he say?

01:13.765 --> 01:15.031
He gave me his business card

01:15.033 --> 01:19.035
and asked me to please
pass it along to Howard.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.470
That doesn't sound terrifying.

01:21.472 --> 01:24.006
To a white guy born here, no.

01:25.910 --> 01:27.743
If you are a brown guy
whose name has

01:27.745 --> 01:30.713
a lot of syllables in it--
terrifying.

01:31.453 --> 01:34.087
You realize if the military declares our
research classified,

01:34.089 --> 01:36.422
they can take the whole
thing away from us.

01:36.424 --> 01:37.757
WOLOWITZ:
And if that happens,

01:37.759 --> 01:39.192
we'll never be able
to sell it commercially.

01:39.194 --> 01:40.460
There goes our big payday.
I was counting

01:40.462 --> 01:42.829
on that money-- I need
to make as much as my wife

01:42.831 --> 01:45.431
so I don't have
to try so hard in bed.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.133
You do that, too?

01:47.135 --> 01:50.003
Oh, yeah. How do you think
I stay this thin?

01:50.005 --> 01:53.173
Gentlemen, I think we are
losing sight of the real issue.

01:53.175 --> 01:56.309
We are on the precipice
of becoming faceless cogs

01:56.311 --> 01:58.645
in the military-industrial
complex.

01:58.647 --> 02:01.347
Isn't that exciting?

02:01.349 --> 02:02.682
You're kidding, right?

02:02.684 --> 02:05.652
Not at all. In <i>Star Wars,</i>
when the stormtroopers

02:05.654 --> 02:07.754
would march
in perfect formation,

02:07.756 --> 02:10.056
harassing civilians,
didn't you ever think,

02:10.058 --> 02:12.225
"Hey, that could be me"?

02:12.227 --> 02:13.893
Sheldon,
we could be contributing

02:13.895 --> 02:16.529
to a weapons system
that oppresses mankind

02:16.531 --> 02:19.132
for the next thousand years.

02:19.134 --> 02:21.434
Okay, Howard's on board.

02:50.873 --> 02:53.507
I'm worried about Howard.
Ever since that guy

02:53.508 --> 02:55.741
from the Air Force showed up,
he's been a nervous wreck.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.743
All right, we work at
a giant pharmaceutical company.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.478
Get him some anti-anxiety meds.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.347
He won't take any pills
that aren't chewable

03:01.349 --> 03:03.416
and shaped like a Flintstone.

03:03.418 --> 03:05.785
You know, when Leonard's
feeling anxious

03:05.787 --> 03:07.219
I make him take a long walk.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.287
Does that help?

03:08.289 --> 03:11.223
Well, for a while.
Then he comes back.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.866
I don't believe this.

03:13.890 --> 03:14.561
What's wrong?

03:14.562 --> 03:16.929
This guy from the office
just congratulated me

03:16.931 --> 03:18.464
on being pregnant.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.633
You did already know, right?

03:21.469 --> 03:23.703
No one at the office did.

03:23.705 --> 03:24.838
Did you tell
anyone?

03:24.862 --> 03:26.374
No.
You told me not to.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.341
I bet it was Barbara Chen
in retrovirus.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.576
She might have heard me
throwing up one morning.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.811
Every since she got

03:31.813 --> 03:34.947
the hearing aid,
she thinks she's so great.

03:35.817 --> 03:38.284
Why don't you want
anyone to know?

03:38.286 --> 03:40.019
'Cause I'm up for a major
immunotherapy study,

03:40.021 --> 03:41.620
and if they find out
I'm pregnant

03:41.622 --> 03:43.322
they might give it
to someone else.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.657
Would they really do that?

03:44.659 --> 03:46.959
I know they would-- they did it
to Barbara Chen last year

03:46.961 --> 03:48.661
when I told everyone
she was pregnant.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.967
Wail till I Snapchat that
my friends might be working

03:54.969 --> 03:57.703
on a top secret
government project.

03:58.673 --> 03:59.872
Are you crazy?

03:59.874 --> 04:01.340
You can't put that on Snapchat.

04:01.342 --> 04:05.277
Fine, I'll put it on Facebook
like a caveman.

04:07.749 --> 04:09.181
You know,
maybe before our meeting

04:09.183 --> 04:10.549
we should talk to a lawyer.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.984
That's not a bad idea.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.086
Well, you must have someone
in your family that's a lawyer.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.688
Why? Because I'm Jewish?

04:15.690 --> 04:17.723
That's like me saying,
"Hey, you're Indian.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.760
Doesn't your cousin work
in a call center?"

04:21.928 --> 04:24.964
My cousin does work
in a call center.

04:25.967 --> 04:29.101
And my cousin's a lawyer.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.638
We don't need
Howard's cousin, no.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.307
We have me.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.710
You're not a lawyer, Sheldon,
you're just a know-it-all.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.178
I am not a know-it-all.

04:39.180 --> 04:41.213
I'm a person
who knows lots of things

04:41.215 --> 04:44.650
and likes to correct
other people when they're wrong.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.819
That's the definition
of being a know-it-all.

04:46.821 --> 04:50.356
Or in German, a <i>Besserwisser.</i>

04:53.161 --> 04:55.494
How did you think you were
gonna hide your pregnancy?

04:55.496 --> 04:58.097
I had a plan-- I kept leaving
Dove Bar wrappers around

04:58.099 --> 05:00.332
to explain any weight gain.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.103
Where did you get
empty Dove Bar wrappers?

05:04.105 --> 05:06.772
From all the Dove Bars
I ate! I'm pregnant!

05:06.774 --> 05:08.808
Try to keep up!

05:10.378 --> 05:12.478
I'm sorry.
I-I have to go find out

05:12.480 --> 05:13.789
if my boss knows.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.953
Well, whatever happens,
we're here for you.

05:15.954 --> 05:17.144
Thanks.
You guys are the best.

05:17.145 --> 05:18.952
Yeah, drive safe. We love you.
And give us a call...

05:18.953 --> 05:20.252
Oh, my God,
it was me, it was me!

05:20.254 --> 05:21.520
I'm the one who blabbed
she was pregnant!

05:21.522 --> 05:22.629
What?!

05:22.653 --> 05:23.390
I didn't mean to.
It just slipped out

05:23.391 --> 05:25.212
in front of her assistant
one day. I...

05:25.236 --> 05:25.991
I forgot my coat.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.893
Oh! Here's your coat, honey.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.895
That's such a cute jacket.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.263
Oh...

05:31.265 --> 05:33.165
God, I feel so bad--
I just lied to her.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.100
Oh, but you did it so well.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.869
That's amazing!

05:38.005 --> 05:39.538
It's like watching a sculptor,

05:39.540 --> 05:42.041
but your clay was lies.

05:42.043 --> 05:44.243
Is that really
what's important right now?

05:44.245 --> 05:47.179
I mean, seriously, you have got
to let me scan your brain

05:47.181 --> 05:50.549
when you're being dishonest
so I can see what lights up.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.851
That's super helpful, Amy.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.752
Thanks a lot.
I can't wait to do that.

05:53.754 --> 05:57.223
I can see a clump of bitch cells
lightin' up from here.

06:00.261 --> 06:03.863
Give me a second
to call my cousin.

06:03.865 --> 06:06.732
I don't see how a tax lawyer
from Fort Lauderdale

06:06.734 --> 06:09.635
could be helpful regarding
intellectual property.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.437
First of all,
he's in Boca Raton,

06:11.439 --> 06:13.739
which is better
than Fort Lauderdale.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.207
But more importantly,

06:15.209 --> 06:18.177
he lasted two days on <i>Jeopardy,</i>

06:18.179 --> 06:19.645
so he's clearly a smart guy.

06:20.915 --> 06:22.882
(Skype ringing)

06:23.718 --> 06:24.850
Hello.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.986
Hey, Marty.
Thanks for talking to us.

06:26.988 --> 06:28.387
Hey, no problem.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.556
Thanks for going to outer space
so no matter what I do

06:30.558 --> 06:32.791
my mom will be
disappointed in me.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.929
Well, I married a little
Catholic girl, so we're even.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.398
Anyway,
this is Leonard and Sheldon.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.400
The three of us came up
with the guidance system.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.669
- Hi. - Hello.
And this is my friend, Raj.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.471
Oh, I'm not on the patent.
I'm just here

06:45.473 --> 06:48.540
because there's a bumblebee
in my office.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.677
I saw it. It's big.

06:52.647 --> 06:54.446
Anyway,
like I said in the e-mail,

06:54.448 --> 06:55.881
this meeting's on Thursday.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.816
Do you have any advice for us?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.718
Well, I don't know much
about patent law.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.420
But, uh, my advice is:

07:01.422 --> 07:04.056
hear them out, offer as little
information as possible,

07:04.058 --> 07:06.458
and whatever you do,
don't sign anything.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.094
"Don't sign anything"?
That's your advice?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.330
Okay, so, uh, if
during this meeting,

07:11.332 --> 07:14.400
one of us were to, say,
complete an oil painting,

07:14.402 --> 07:18.170
you'd recommend that
we leave that unsigned?

07:18.172 --> 07:19.538
That's not what I meant.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.606
That's what you said.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.373
That's not what I meant.

07:21.375 --> 07:23.442
This must be how
you practice law

07:23.444 --> 07:25.678
in Boca Raton, by saying
things you don't mean

07:25.680 --> 07:27.546
and meaning things
you don't say.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.282
Howard, why is he yelling at me?

07:30.284 --> 07:32.284
All right, you
were on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

07:32.286 --> 07:35.921
Allow me to Alex Trebek this and
put it in the form of a question:

07:35.923 --> 07:39.391
Who has been a complete
waste of our time?

07:40.695 --> 07:42.094
Marty, let me call you back.

07:42.096 --> 07:43.996
Someday, when I'm up
on murder charges,

07:43.998 --> 07:46.899
you'll be hearing from me.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.068
You don't need him.
I'll represent you.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.340
Hi.
Hey. What brings you by?

07:54.342 --> 07:57.409
Oh, had to go to a sales seminar
on our new sleeping pill.

07:57.411 --> 07:58.249
Oh. How was it?

07:58.273 --> 07:59.012
Great.

07:59.013 --> 07:59.811
Fell asleep?

07:59.835 --> 08:01.448
In, like, two minutes. Yeah.

08:01.449 --> 08:04.049
So, how is everything
going around here?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.652
Are you still upset about people
finding out you're pregnant?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.520
I'm furious.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.255
Sure, sure.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.691
Uh, did you ever figure out
who told?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.960
No. I confronted Barbara Chen,
but she claimed

08:14.962 --> 08:17.162
she didn't know
what I was talking about.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.865
Hmm. Well, I guess it's
just gonna remain a mystery,

08:19.867 --> 08:21.967
you know, like whatever happened
in that seminar

08:21.969 --> 08:24.536
after they dimmed the lights.
(laughs)

08:24.538 --> 08:26.105
It had to be Barbara.

08:26.107 --> 08:29.108
I've been trying to figure out
a way to get back at her.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.209
Do you think

08:30.211 --> 08:31.910
using her work computer
to Google

08:31.912 --> 08:35.214
"how to be a prostitute"
is over the line?

08:35.216 --> 08:36.648
Uh, you know, when I was

08:36.650 --> 08:39.150
in high school, there was this girl
who was talking about me

08:39.153 --> 08:41.053
behind my back, so me
and all my friends,

08:41.054 --> 08:44.790
we cornered her in the bathroom
and <i>forgave her.</i>

08:46.527 --> 08:48.160
What kind of revenge is that?

08:48.162 --> 08:50.929
This woman screwed with my job.
She's got to pay.

08:51.766 --> 08:53.866
Okay, all right, honey,
you know what?

08:53.868 --> 08:56.969
There was something I was too
scared to tell you yesterday,

08:56.971 --> 09:00.739
a-and now... I'm just balls-out
terrified to tell you, but...

09:00.741 --> 09:02.408
the truth is it...

09:02.410 --> 09:04.777
wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me.

09:04.779 --> 09:06.745
I'm the reason everyone knows.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.480
Why did you do that?

09:08.482 --> 09:11.383
Well, it was an accident.
I am so sorry I lied.

09:12.253 --> 09:13.685
Get out.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.523
(sighs)

09:19.260 --> 09:22.694
Oh, you know, I also lied
about the girl in the bathroom.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.830
Yeah, we actually dumped
her retainer in the toilet

09:24.832 --> 09:27.533
and put it back in her mouth.

09:31.439 --> 09:35.040
I don't understand why
I can't talk at this meeting.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.810
'Cause when you talk,
it enrages people.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.546
Okay.

09:40.548 --> 09:41.947
Quick question.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.083
Am I allowed
to exchange pleasantries

09:44.085 --> 09:45.517
upon meeting this colonel?

09:45.519 --> 09:46.685
Yes.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.187
Am I allowed to inform him

09:48.189 --> 09:52.057
that Colonel Sanders was never
actually in the military?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.725
I'm getting enraged.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.627
Fine.

09:55.629 --> 09:56.795
Ooh.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.764
Can I use text-to-speech
software?

09:58.766 --> 09:59.403
No!

09:59.427 --> 10:00.300
Don't speak.

10:00.301 --> 10:03.001
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Aw, nuts.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.470
MAN:
Gentlemen!

10:04.472 --> 10:06.138
I'm Colonel
Williams.

10:06.140 --> 10:07.606
Thank you for meeting with me.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.675
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:11.512 --> 10:14.980
So, which one of you is
the brains behind all this?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.815
It's a group effort,

10:16.817 --> 10:21.053
but I guess if we had to pick
a main brain, it would be me.

10:21.055 --> 10:23.322
(muffled whimper)

10:32.004 --> 10:33.303
(machine whirring dies down)

10:33.305 --> 10:34.904
And because
of the quantum vortices,

10:34.906 --> 10:36.172
this can run perpetually?

10:36.174 --> 10:37.407
Exactly.

10:37.409 --> 10:39.275
Yeah, you have a good
grasp of the physics.

10:39.277 --> 10:41.371
Well, I'm a scientist
by training.

10:41.395 --> 10:42.246
WOLOWITZ:
Really?

10:42.247 --> 10:43.202
You're a physicist?

10:43.226 --> 10:45.010
Better. I'm an engineer.

10:50.022 --> 10:52.722
Where did you go to school?

10:52.724 --> 10:53.556
MIT.

10:53.558 --> 10:55.492
Oh.
Well, hey, me, too.

10:55.494 --> 10:56.593
I should have known.

10:56.595 --> 10:58.728
Behind every great invention
is an MIT mind.

11:02.134 --> 11:04.734
I'll cut to the chase.

11:04.736 --> 11:06.536
The Air Force
believes there's an application

11:06.538 --> 11:08.171
for this technology,

11:08.173 --> 11:10.306
and we're interested
in funding your research.

11:10.308 --> 11:13.243
Well, thanks,
but you should know

11:13.245 --> 11:16.746
we're a little concerned about
this being used in weapons.

11:16.748 --> 11:18.948
Oh, well,
let me put your mind at ease.

11:18.950 --> 11:21.651
What we use it for
is none of your business.

11:23.989 --> 11:26.890
I don't know how
I feel about this.

11:26.892 --> 11:29.259
Look, guys,
it's just a guidance system.

11:29.261 --> 11:30.894
It's not like
you're handing us

11:30.896 --> 11:32.729
the Death Star from <i>Star Trek.</i>

11:38.270 --> 11:39.703
All you need to
worry about is,

11:39.705 --> 11:42.272
right now, it's this big,

11:42.274 --> 11:46.209
and we need it to be...
this big.

11:46.211 --> 11:48.878
That's a
lot less big.

11:48.880 --> 11:53.550
Yes, it's...
this much less big.

11:53.552 --> 11:56.019
I'm not even sure
that's possible.

11:56.021 --> 11:58.188
Well, I ran it
by some colleagues at MIT,

11:58.190 --> 12:00.857
and they thought they could
get it done in four months.

12:00.859 --> 12:01.970
Four months?

12:01.994 --> 12:03.861
Yeah, we'll do it
in two! (laughs)

12:03.862 --> 12:05.829
Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

12:05.831 --> 12:07.897
I'm the actual brains
behind this project.

12:07.899 --> 12:09.899
Also, engineers aren't
real scientists,

12:09.901 --> 12:11.434
MIT's a trade school,

12:11.436 --> 12:14.704
and the Death Star is
from <i>Star Wars,</i> not <i>Star Trek!</i>

12:14.706 --> 12:16.840
But otherwise,

12:16.842 --> 12:19.743
thank you for your service.

12:22.581 --> 12:24.080
(knock at door)

12:24.082 --> 12:25.815
Hi.

12:25.817 --> 12:28.852
Howard told me you were working
late, so I brought dinner.

12:28.854 --> 12:31.654
Oh, thanks. You know, I just
wanted to get some work done

12:31.656 --> 12:32.822
without people
congratulating me

12:32.824 --> 12:34.224
about the baby
every five minutes.

12:34.226 --> 12:35.825
I spent my day
alone in the lab

12:35.827 --> 12:38.595
waiting for a rat
to die of anthrax.

12:38.597 --> 12:42.031
Did you come here
to bring me dinner or to gloat?

12:42.033 --> 12:45.368
Well, I came to see
how you were feeling,

12:45.370 --> 12:47.337
but I'm guessing
still angry?

12:47.339 --> 12:48.705
I'm sorry.

12:48.707 --> 12:51.107
My boss wants to meet with me,
and I'm stressing.

12:51.109 --> 12:53.676
You really think they're gonna
start treating you differently?

12:53.678 --> 12:55.145
Are you kidding?

12:55.147 --> 12:57.080
I've always been
treated differently!

12:57.082 --> 12:59.115
Look at me!
Listen to me!

12:59.117 --> 13:01.417
I mean, the first thought
when you see me isn't,

13:01.419 --> 13:03.119
"That's a scientist."

13:03.121 --> 13:06.156
It's, "I wonder if her mommy
knows where she is."

13:08.226 --> 13:12.262
I am really regretting
that I got you a Happy Meal.

13:14.599 --> 13:16.699
I've worked so hard
to get where I am,

13:16.701 --> 13:19.235
and I don't want
to get sent back to square one

13:19.237 --> 13:20.804
because I'm pregnant.

13:20.806 --> 13:22.338
I understand how you feel.

13:22.340 --> 13:23.637
Thank you.

13:23.661 --> 13:24.675
I wish there were

13:24.676 --> 13:26.709
some way I could make it better.

13:26.711 --> 13:29.145
Well, you brought me
French fries. That's a start.

13:29.147 --> 13:33.817
Uh, actually, I got you apple
slices 'cause you're pregnant.

13:34.653 --> 13:36.653
Apple slices?

13:36.655 --> 13:40.123
What kind of lunatic goes
to McDonald's and gets fruit?!

13:40.125 --> 13:42.125
I'll be right back.

13:42.127 --> 13:44.160
And a chocolate shake!

13:47.699 --> 13:50.066
(door opens)

13:50.068 --> 13:51.701
- Hi.
- Hello.

13:51.703 --> 13:53.536
What are you doing?

13:53.538 --> 13:56.806
Oh, Leonard's mad at me,
so I'm making him lemon bars.

13:56.808 --> 14:00.043
Does he even
like lemon bars?

14:00.045 --> 14:02.178
Not really.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.448
But I'm mad at him, too,
so lemon bars it is.

14:06.284 --> 14:08.151
Something happen
at the meeting?

14:08.153 --> 14:10.486
They made me promise
I wouldn't talk.

14:10.488 --> 14:11.596
And you talked?

14:11.620 --> 14:12.823
Well, now, see?

14:12.824 --> 14:15.124
You knew what was gonna
happen. Why didn't they?

14:15.126 --> 14:17.627
Anyway, now we're committed
to completing this project

14:17.629 --> 14:19.596
in a ridiculously
short time frame,

14:19.598 --> 14:21.231
and everyone's
upset with me.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.199
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

14:23.201 --> 14:24.634
Bernadette's mad at me, too.

14:24.636 --> 14:26.736
Mm. If it makes <i>you</i>
feel any better,

14:26.738 --> 14:29.672
a parasitoid wasp known
as <i>Oobius depressus</i>

14:29.674 --> 14:32.108
has been rediscovered
after 101 years

14:32.110 --> 14:34.477
of presumed extinction.

14:35.313 --> 14:37.480
Why would that
make me feel better?

14:37.482 --> 14:41.317
Why would your Bernadette
thing make me feel better?

14:41.319 --> 14:42.886
At least mine
was educational.

14:42.888 --> 14:44.921
Okay. Never mind.

14:44.923 --> 14:46.456
Look, I'm sorry.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.058
Tell me why
Bernadette is upset with you.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.861
Well, I told people at work
that she's pregnant.

14:51.863 --> 14:53.930
She wasn't ready
for them to know.

14:53.932 --> 14:55.398
Why would you do that?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.467
Well, it just slipped out.
I feel terrible.

14:57.469 --> 14:59.569
See, that's exactly
what happened to me,

14:59.571 --> 15:02.805
except that I said it on
purpose, and I have no regrets.

15:05.076 --> 15:07.477
Is it even possible
to get this done in two months?

15:07.479 --> 15:09.312
Well, maybe. I don't know.
We'll have to work

15:09.314 --> 15:11.447
12 hours a day,
seven days a week.

15:11.449 --> 15:14.250
Which means I won't be able to
make Penny breakfast every day,

15:14.252 --> 15:15.852
and she'll realize
my brioche French toast

15:15.854 --> 15:18.721
was the only thing
keeping her in the marriage.

15:18.723 --> 15:20.323
I love your
French toast.

15:20.325 --> 15:21.724
Oh, thanks, man.

15:21.726 --> 15:25.795
So, why did you guys
even agree to the deadline?

15:25.797 --> 15:27.363
We didn't. Sheldon did.

15:27.365 --> 15:28.496
And you just let him?

15:28.497 --> 15:31.335
Well, the colonel said it was
for the good of the country,

15:31.336 --> 15:32.468
and the funding
is substantial.

15:32.470 --> 15:34.170
No, but mostly, there
was an awkward pause,

15:34.172 --> 15:37.173
and I broke it
by saying, "Okay."

15:37.175 --> 15:41.311
So I guess I won't be
seeing you guys for a while.

15:41.313 --> 15:42.506
Oh, looks like it.

15:42.530 --> 15:43.480
Wow.

15:43.481 --> 15:46.249
You're going off to work with
the military, leaving me behind.

15:46.251 --> 15:49.419
Now I know how
all those army wives feel.

15:49.421 --> 15:51.821
Would you stop?

15:51.823 --> 15:53.957
We're just gonna be on
the other side of campus.

15:53.959 --> 15:56.592
And right here.

15:56.594 --> 16:00.964
You are a deeply silly man.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.667
He is so afraid of his feelings.

16:09.607 --> 16:10.965
Oh, hi.

16:10.988 --> 16:12.442
Got a minute?

16:12.444 --> 16:14.944
Yeah, come on in.

16:15.981 --> 16:18.081
I just wanted to apologize.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.483
I know what you did
was an accident.

16:20.485 --> 16:23.653
Oh, thank you,
and I'm sorry I lied about it.

16:23.655 --> 16:25.922
For what it's worth,
you're a great liar.

16:25.924 --> 16:27.991
Oh, that's what Amy said.

16:27.993 --> 16:30.626
So what's going on with
the research project?

16:30.628 --> 16:32.929
Are they gonna
let you run it?

16:32.931 --> 16:35.098
Well, my boss said
he hadn't decided yet,

16:35.100 --> 16:37.967
so I gently reminded him
that he's an old rich white guy,

16:37.969 --> 16:39.635
and I'm a sweet
little pregnant lady

16:39.637 --> 16:42.538
who's not afraid to cry
in front of a jury.

16:42.540 --> 16:45.274
You threatened to sue?

16:45.276 --> 16:48.244
Hey, I learned a long time ago,
when you're four feet eleven

16:48.246 --> 16:50.179
and eye level
with every guy's crotch,

16:50.181 --> 16:52.615
that's where you punch.

16:52.617 --> 16:54.350
That's funny.

16:54.352 --> 16:56.786
I learned something
totally different.

16:57.956 --> 16:59.989
Do you know what?

16:59.991 --> 17:01.924
It's just a research project.

17:01.926 --> 17:03.526
The most important job
in the world

17:03.528 --> 17:04.926
is gonna be raising this child.

17:04.929 --> 17:07.063
It's all I need
to give my life meaning.

17:07.065 --> 17:09.165
Oh, that's so beautiful.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.967
You believe me? Oh, good.

17:10.969 --> 17:12.167
11 more chumps like you,

17:12.170 --> 17:14.369
I'll have the jury
eating out of my hand.

17:16.808 --> 17:19.909
I never realized
this building was classified.

17:19.911 --> 17:22.878
Maybe that's because
it's classified.

17:24.482 --> 17:27.215
Wish we weren't so far
from my parking space.

17:27.218 --> 17:30.019
The way you put away
those lemon bars,

17:30.021 --> 17:32.021
perhaps that's a good thing.

17:32.023 --> 17:35.525
I'd like to reinstate
the you-not-talking rule.

17:35.527 --> 17:38.294
Why? It clearly doesn't work.

17:39.631 --> 17:42.265
I guess this is it. (laughs)

17:42.267 --> 17:43.966
LEONARD:
Is that a retinal scanner?

17:43.968 --> 17:45.802
Let's find out.
