And so sure about us. And I'm scared.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.000
I guess this, like, ain't the best time
to be telling you this.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.900
No, no, baby, I'm really happy
that you did because...

14:42.100 --> 14:46.600
...I've been scared too.
- Really?

14:47.100 --> 14:50.300
I thought I was alone in this.
Why you ain't tell me, girl?

14:50.500 --> 14:55.000
I don't know. I guess for
the same reasons you didn't tell me.

14:55.200 --> 15:00.000
I can't tell you how good it feels
to know I can tell you anything.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.600
- Now I know we gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.300
I love you, baby.

Well, this is it. It's all she wrote.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.200
Last chance for gas.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.800
Last train to Clarksville.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.500
Last of the Mohicans.

15:24.100 --> 15:28.200
You know, as hard as this is to believe,
I'm gonna miss you.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.600
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

16:35.800 --> 16:41.000
...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.400
Let us pray.

16:44.100 --> 16:49.100
Dear heavenly father, we ask that
as Will and Lisa commit their lives...

16:49.300 --> 16:53.700
...to one another, you will
strengthen and encourage them...

16:53.900 --> 17:00.100
...and guide them in their
day-to-day trials and triumphs of life.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.900
In your name we pray. Amen.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.900
ALL:
Amen.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.800
Now, if anyone can show just cause...

17:07.900 --> 17:11.500
...why Will and Lisa should not be
joined together...

17:11.599 --> 17:15.700
...let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.300
William, do you take
Beula Lisa Wilkes...

17:27.400 --> 17:29.600
...to be your lawfully wedded wife?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.400
Yes, I...

17:35.400 --> 17:36.800
Whoo!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.600
...do.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
But I don't.

[CROWD MURMURING]

17:50.200 --> 17:53.800
Will, I'm sorry, but I think if we both
have doubts about this whole thing...

17:54.000 --> 17:56.200
Wait, wait, no, had. We had doubts.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.000
Remember, babe? We talked about it.
We both feel better.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.600
No, baby, you feel better. But I think
we're making a really big mistake.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.200
And if you think about it,
you will too.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.000
No. No, Lisa...

18:10.200 --> 18:12.500
...I really love you.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.700
Will, I love you too, but I think
our parents might be right.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.600
I think maybe we just rushed into
this thing too fast.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.700
Well...

18:25.700 --> 18:29.600
Well, I guess we shouldn't get married,
then, should we?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.200
Not today.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.200
Hey, looks like we finally
agree on something.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.800
Yeah.

18:54.300 --> 18:59.700
Lisa and I would like to thank you all
for coming today...

18:59.800 --> 19:03.600
...but ain't nobody gonna be
jumping over no brooms in here.

19:03.800 --> 19:08.500
Well, save it for that 50 pounds of shrimp
swimming around on that damn ice swan.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.400
Not so fast, Will.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.900
Vy, I always thought...

19:17.300 --> 19:19.900
...that a man only got
one chance at happiness.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.000
And then I met you.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.300
We met at 10,000 feet in the air.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.200
And I promise you, baby,
if you marry me...

19:27.400 --> 19:30.200
...neither of us will ever
come down.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.300
Vy...

19:35.200 --> 19:36.700
...will you be my wife?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.300
- Yes, Fred, I will.
- All right.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.400
If... If my son...

19:45.500 --> 19:47.800
...will give me away.
- No. No, Mom, no.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.500
Absolutely not. You said that
me and Lisa were rushing too fast.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.100
Y'all gotta take some time
to think about this.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.200
The boy's right.
We should think about this.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.000
- Yeah.
- Did you think about it?

20:00.300 --> 20:02.200
- Yeah.
- Me too. Let's get married.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.000
Wait.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.500
Hold up. Wait a minute.
Y'all need to take some more time.

20:10.700 --> 20:14.100
Boy, I ain't got that much time.
I'm getting old. Now move.

You're gonna need your bouquet.

Oh, thank you, baby.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.100
Rap on, Rev.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.500
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here again today...

20:41.700 --> 20:45.500
...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.300
Let us pray.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.100
Dear heavenly father...

20:52.000 --> 20:56.100
I am not kidding. Irene told Jane
that Debbie told Gail...

20:56.200 --> 20:58.800
...that Will Smith did not get married.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.500
I know! Isn't it great?

21:00.700 --> 21:03.600
Girl, who said it doesn't pay
to pray?

21:03.700 --> 21:07.200
Oh, yes, it does. My prayers came true.
Did he marry her?

21:07.300 --> 21:09.200
I cannot believe he is back
on the market.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.000
I mean, you know, I'm sorry
for the girl, but who cares?

21:12.200 --> 21:15.200
He is so fine. Did you see him?

21:15.300 --> 21:18.500
Oh, even in that tux
he was looking good.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.200
WILL: Wait, wait... No. No.
Wait a... Wait a minute.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.600
Wait a minute, now.
This is... This is all just too soon.

that's a different story.
