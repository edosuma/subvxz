00:00.140 --> 00:01.681
<i>When you start a new company,</i>

00:01.708 --> 00:03.528
<i>it can feel like there aren't
enough work hours in the day.</i>

00:03.610 --> 00:06.061
<i>So I came up with a little
idea for how to fix that.</i>

00:06.111 --> 00:08.647
<i>And that was to start work at breakfast.</i>

00:08.672 --> 00:10.466
Eddie, why aren't you wearing pants?

00:10.491 --> 00:12.836
Sorry about that. I spilled
some syrup on my slacks.

00:12.861 --> 00:14.551
I had to toss 'em in
the washing machine.

00:14.653 --> 00:15.785
But don't worry,

00:15.854 --> 00:18.054
I was able to add them to
that load of your intimates.

00:18.289 --> 00:19.689
By the way, you really ought to be

00:19.791 --> 00:21.291
hand-washing a lot of that stuff.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.493
We're still working out the kinks.

00:23.562 --> 00:25.595
Mm. This milk has gone bad.

00:25.697 --> 00:27.063
Oh, no, I brought that from home.

00:27.132 --> 00:30.093
I'm intolerant of all milks
except for walnut and deer.

00:30.460 --> 00:31.773
You're sitting in my chair.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.060
Well, I thought that was your chair.

00:33.085 --> 00:34.701
It was... yesterday.

00:34.810 --> 00:36.131
But today, it's that one.

00:36.178 --> 00:38.760
Well, I talked to my
friend, the chair fairy,

00:38.862 --> 00:41.065
and she said that I could
have this one today.

00:41.112 --> 00:43.143
Not everything has a fairy, blondie.

00:43.596 --> 00:45.121
Big day, everyone!

00:45.191 --> 00:47.660
Al has a very important
promotional appearance.

00:47.746 --> 00:49.887
I booked him on the
"Vanessa Stanhope Show."

00:49.973 --> 00:51.488
Cool! Can't wait to listen!

00:51.556 --> 00:52.889
Uh, you will not be listening.

00:52.958 --> 00:55.181
That show is not for kids.
She's totally R-rated.

00:55.228 --> 00:57.327
Brian Sokolowski's mom
lets him listen to it.

00:57.396 --> 01:00.230
Well, Brian Sokolowski's mom
is 95 percent chardonnay.

01:02.634 --> 01:04.932
Ben, your girlfriend's calling!

01:04.986 --> 01:07.096
She's not my girlfriend.
She's my band mate.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.899
The only thing we're
interested in making

01:08.946 --> 01:10.250
is beautiful music together.

01:10.313 --> 01:12.102
I was in a band at your age.

01:12.141 --> 01:13.220
I get it.

01:13.245 --> 01:15.035
Make sure you make safe music.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.213
Al, can I talk to you for a sec?

01:18.756 --> 01:20.250
When are we gonna be done with this?

01:20.318 --> 01:21.724
Oh, I think it's kind of working.

01:21.802 --> 01:22.819
We're all getting along.

01:22.921 --> 01:25.162
Wait, where's my folder?
It was just here.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.544
Maybe the folder fairy
filed it away for you...

01:29.327 --> 01:30.460
in the dishwasher.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:40.639 --> 01:42.071
<i>It was a huge day for us.</i>

01:42.173 --> 01:44.240
<i>If I could nail this
Vanessa Stanhope interview,</i>

01:44.342 --> 01:46.142
<i>it could change everything
for the company.</i>

01:46.218 --> 01:48.069
Here are your talking
points for the interview.

01:48.132 --> 01:49.760
Sorry, but the printer was broken again.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.148
Why am I the only one who
even attempts to fix it?

01:52.208 --> 01:54.528
Oh, I'm so sorry, Deirdre, but
you're the only one who knows how.

01:54.562 --> 01:56.153
Plus, you got those
little raccoon hands.

01:56.221 --> 01:58.265
You know how to burrow in
there and wake everything up.

01:58.343 --> 01:59.956
You know, at my old job at Cheer Up,

02:00.058 --> 02:01.824
I used to actually produce radio shows.

02:01.888 --> 02:02.987
It's a start-up.

02:03.049 --> 02:04.548
Everyone's making sacrifices.

02:04.729 --> 02:07.397
I had to talk to a guy with
an artisanal mustache today.

02:07.499 --> 02:08.999
- Oof.
- Okay, speaking of Cheer Up, I called

02:09.024 --> 02:11.809
over there to see if they would
even consider promoting the podcast,

02:11.881 --> 02:14.037
- and they want me to come in.
- Really?

02:14.139 --> 02:15.825
Why would they want to do
that after the way we left?

02:15.874 --> 02:17.073
I mean, tears were shed.

02:17.106 --> 02:19.108
I mean, mostly by me,
but tears were shed.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.566
Surprisingly, they were open to it.

02:20.613 --> 02:21.863
I thought Eddie could come with

02:21.888 --> 02:23.386
since promotion is
technically his department.

02:23.448 --> 02:24.455
That's a good idea!

02:24.516 --> 02:26.115
Eddie's been on a bit of a roll lately,

02:26.217 --> 02:28.451
booking me on this
big, fancy radio show.

02:28.506 --> 02:29.519
I can't believe

02:29.621 --> 02:31.873
Vanessa Stanhope
actually knows who I am.

02:32.661 --> 02:33.747
Who are you again?

02:33.866 --> 02:35.763
Oh, Alex Schuman with Ajana.

02:35.827 --> 02:38.227
I just want to thank you so
much for having me on your show.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.933
I'm a huge fan, and I really think

02:39.981 --> 02:41.994
your listeners are gonna be
very interested in my podcast.

02:42.050 --> 02:44.298
No, they won't.
This isn't public radio, man.

02:44.353 --> 02:45.702
My listeners don't wanna hear you

02:45.749 --> 02:47.579
softly try to solve a murder mystery

02:47.633 --> 02:48.781
to indie music for 12 weeks.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.939
Oh, it's not a crime show.

02:49.985 --> 02:52.071
These are people who are
stuck in traffic, all right?

02:52.121 --> 02:54.300
They want you to make 'em laugh.
Keep it punchy.

02:54.346 --> 02:55.778
Give me short, sexy anecdotes.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.645
- What are those, talking points?
- Yeah.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.464
No. You try to work these
into the interview,

02:59.517 --> 03:01.918
it's gonna be over before you
can whisper, "Whodunnit."

03:01.988 --> 03:03.259
Welcome back.

03:03.321 --> 03:05.466
We are here with Arthur Schumberg...

03:05.491 --> 03:06.496
Alex Schuman.

03:06.521 --> 03:08.658
Who wants to tell you
about his new podcast.

03:08.704 --> 03:09.735
Boring!

03:10.829 --> 03:12.695
But don't worry... he was just about

03:12.797 --> 03:15.526
to tell me about the
best sex he's ever had.

03:18.703 --> 03:21.337
All right, kids. You two get to jammin'.

03:21.439 --> 03:23.366
And I will get to jammin', too.

03:23.399 --> 03:25.633
Those PB&Js will be up in a Jiff...

03:25.726 --> 03:26.743
peanut butter.

03:26.845 --> 03:28.611
All right, come on.

03:28.713 --> 03:31.047
Can't all be winners.

03:31.149 --> 03:33.021
Yeah, but some of them should be.

03:33.170 --> 03:34.696
Did I tell you I like your shirt, Ben?

03:34.753 --> 03:36.155
Yeah, like eight times today.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.663
- Ben, be nice.
- What?

03:37.756 --> 03:40.063
Emily doesn't mind it when
I call it like I see it.

03:40.286 --> 03:41.606
That's my Benny-Bear.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.892
He's so honest.

03:42.994 --> 03:45.928
That's why his music is
so raw and truthful.

03:46.031 --> 03:47.430
This girl's out of her mind.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.804
So, what's this chorus
you've been yapping about?

03:50.969 --> 03:52.001
Here goes.

03:52.103 --> 03:55.738
♪ I can't stop loving you ♪

03:55.840 --> 03:58.341
♪ Though I try and I try ♪

03:58.443 --> 04:01.511
♪ Hard to stop loving you, yeah ♪

04:02.305 --> 04:04.680
♪ I know you yearn for me, too ♪

04:04.783 --> 04:08.518
♪ Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you ♪

04:08.620 --> 04:11.863
♪ Oh, you can't stop lovin' me ♪

04:13.792 --> 04:14.857
What do you think?

04:14.959 --> 04:16.159
Mm, not too shabby.

04:16.261 --> 04:18.110
You're a little pitchy, but don't worry.

04:18.141 --> 04:19.728
I'll be able to fix that in GarageBand.

04:19.831 --> 04:21.029
Great.

04:21.132 --> 04:23.076
I believe these are the chords?

04:26.638 --> 04:29.472
<i>While I was off plugging our
podcast with Vanessa Stanhope,</i>

04:29.574 --> 04:31.781
<i>Eddie and Deirdre were trying
to get a plug at Cheer Up.</i>

04:32.266 --> 04:33.770
Glass of salad?

04:34.179 --> 04:35.344
Don't mind if I do.

04:35.413 --> 04:37.833
I can't believe you used
to work someplace so fancy.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.295
Get a load of this table.

04:40.285 --> 04:42.552
What is this, mahogany?

04:42.654 --> 04:44.020
Oh, yeah.

04:44.122 --> 04:45.455
That's mahogany. Take a sniff.

04:45.523 --> 04:48.173
I-I don't know anything
about smelling woods.

04:48.249 --> 04:50.483
Beautiful, but very hard to move.

04:50.532 --> 04:52.219
We should probably just
leave it where it is, then.

04:52.256 --> 04:54.423
- There she is!
- Deirds!

04:54.862 --> 04:57.017
Eddie Laguzza, CFO of Ajana,

04:57.056 --> 04:58.334
orange belt in Jiu Jitsu.

04:58.388 --> 05:00.288
That's not a threat,
I just have to tell you.

05:00.359 --> 05:03.055
Eddie, would it be okay if we
talked to Deirdre alone for a sec?

05:03.141 --> 05:04.594
It's just some old colleague gossip.

05:04.642 --> 05:06.017
- It would bore you.
- Sure.

05:06.079 --> 05:08.144
I think I'll go revisit
that strudel platter.

05:08.213 --> 05:09.445
Those are free, right?

05:09.514 --> 05:10.813
Absolutely. Enjoy.

05:10.882 --> 05:12.081
I love this place.

05:13.084 --> 05:15.852
So, Deirdre, we've been
worried about you.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.256
Tom Moffat said his girlfriend
called an Uber the other day

05:18.338 --> 05:20.569
and when it showed up,
you were driving it!

05:21.214 --> 05:22.380
What the heck, Deirds?

05:22.405 --> 05:23.559
Okay, well, that's just a way

05:23.584 --> 05:24.894
to make some extra cash, you know,

05:24.919 --> 05:26.952
until our salaries adjust slash start.

05:27.053 --> 05:28.357
I only drive a few nights.

05:28.445 --> 05:30.475
And weekends. And holidays.

05:30.529 --> 05:31.634
And the Super Bowl,

05:31.703 --> 05:34.003
and the even nights of
Hanukkah, and my birthday.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.506
That is so, so, so sad.

05:36.608 --> 05:39.067
No, no, no. Overall, things are great.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.210
Which is why I'm super
psyched you invited me here

05:41.279 --> 05:43.146
to talk about promoting Alex's podcast.

05:43.214 --> 05:45.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow
your roll, Deirds.

05:45.597 --> 05:46.948
Alex stabbed us in the back.

05:46.987 --> 05:48.618
He can go to hell in a hand-basket.

05:48.686 --> 05:50.967
- We don't even care how he gets there.
- Skip the basket.

05:51.022 --> 05:52.784
We asked you here because we want you

05:52.824 --> 05:55.503
to come back to Cheer
Up as an on-air host.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.425
- What?
- We miss your energy.

05:57.511 --> 05:58.519
Your verve.

05:58.563 --> 06:00.396
Your <i> je ne sais quoi!</i>

06:00.465 --> 06:03.699
I mean,<i> merci,</i> but I'm happy where I am.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.171
Sure you are, of course.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.270
You don't need to decide right now.

06:07.338 --> 06:08.437
Just think about it.

06:10.074 --> 06:12.008
- Hey, Quinn.
- There's my man!

06:12.849 --> 06:14.310
Quinn would be your assistant.

06:14.412 --> 06:16.679
He just graduated from massage school.

06:16.781 --> 06:17.847
Very strong hands.

06:17.949 --> 06:19.463
I recommend the peppermint oil.

06:19.784 --> 06:20.901
It tingles.

06:23.221 --> 06:24.954
Are you sure you were
allowed to take that?

06:25.056 --> 06:27.146
It was just sitting in the
lobby on that table there.

06:27.203 --> 06:28.787
Someone clearly left it behind.

06:29.294 --> 06:31.267
So, you gonna take the job?

06:31.587 --> 06:32.828
What? How did you even...

06:32.897 --> 06:35.405
I've been around the block a few times.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.567
Plus, the guy replacing
the crudités asked,

06:37.669 --> 06:39.302
"Is Deirdre gonna take the job?"

06:39.349 --> 06:42.200
Okay, no. Totally no,
never ever. Totally never.

06:42.244 --> 06:43.533
That's... It's not even a thing.

06:43.618 --> 06:45.851
Oh, that's very convincing.

06:47.645 --> 06:49.245
- Who's that guy?
- Quinn.

06:49.347 --> 06:50.713
He'd be working under me.

06:50.815 --> 06:52.114
I mean, I'd be over him.

06:52.217 --> 06:54.016
I mean, he'd be on me... on my desk.

06:54.118 --> 06:55.418
There would be a hierarchy,

06:55.520 --> 06:56.886
and I would sit on top of him.

06:56.989 --> 06:58.001
You know what I mean!

06:58.032 --> 07:00.456
All right. You're telling me that
the best sex you've ever had

07:00.491 --> 07:01.757
was with your wife?

07:01.782 --> 07:02.782
- Whoa!
- It's true.

07:02.807 --> 07:05.774
It might be true, man, but it
is so boring. You know what,

07:05.805 --> 07:07.053
I think it's time to wrap this up.

07:07.131 --> 07:08.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa. W-What if I told you

07:08.926 --> 07:10.870
that it all happened in
the back of a police car?

07:11.987 --> 07:14.211
All right, that made it
move a little. Go on.

07:14.283 --> 07:17.173
Oh, well, in college, I drove around

07:17.275 --> 07:19.590
in this beat-up old cop car

07:19.621 --> 07:21.444
I got at a police auction for no money.

07:21.546 --> 07:24.247
And I had this idea to take
Rooni on a date to the park.

07:24.315 --> 07:25.948
We were gonna have take-out Chinese.

07:26.050 --> 07:27.164
- Oi.
- So wait, wait, wait.

07:27.210 --> 07:28.616
When we're picking up the take-out,

07:28.663 --> 07:29.952
it starts pouring rain.

07:30.054 --> 07:31.787
So we're racing back to the car,

07:31.856 --> 07:33.923
we're drenched, we're totally laughing.

07:34.025 --> 07:35.558
It's like "The Notebook," only slower.

07:35.660 --> 07:36.859
Get to the good stuff, man!

07:36.920 --> 07:39.061
Okay, okay. So, in our haste
to get out of the rain,

07:39.122 --> 07:40.288
we jumped in the backseat.

07:40.343 --> 07:41.421
But it's a police car,

07:41.458 --> 07:43.393
and those doors don't
open from the inside.

07:43.466 --> 07:44.565
Oh, I know.

07:44.791 --> 07:46.624
So at first we were, like, panicking.

07:46.671 --> 07:48.216
But then we realized, you know what?

07:48.270 --> 07:49.561
It's kind of romantic, you know?

07:49.641 --> 07:52.526
We got hot food,
the rain is hitting the windows...

07:52.577 --> 07:54.543
And then you two took it to bang town.

07:54.646 --> 07:56.331
Well, I'm not gonna go into details.

07:56.362 --> 07:58.414
But let's just say it was
the best first date...

07:58.516 --> 08:01.117
Oh, it was the first date?!

08:01.219 --> 08:03.154
- There it is!
- Ladies and gentlemen, we have a show.

08:04.689 --> 08:07.001
Rooni Schuman gave it
up on the first date.

08:07.173 --> 08:08.336
- Well...
- Way to go, Alex,

08:08.361 --> 08:10.717
you dirty little freak. I
didn't think you had it in ya.

08:11.225 --> 08:14.164
Everybody, keep your eyes
peeled for Alex's new podcast,

08:14.198 --> 08:16.532
"Our Family's Business,"
and we'll be right back.

08:16.634 --> 08:20.336
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.739
You know, you got a cool wife, man.

08:22.778 --> 08:24.239
She let you tell that story.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.596
If I'd done that, my wife would kill me.

08:30.598 --> 08:31.753
<i>I came home praying</i>

08:31.802 --> 08:34.073
<i>Rooni hadn't heard me on
the radio that afternoon.</i>

08:34.153 --> 08:37.187
<i>Fortunately, I was pretty
good at playing it cool.</i>

08:38.004 --> 08:39.551
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:39.648 --> 08:41.011
How'd it go with Vanessa Stanhope?

08:41.067 --> 08:42.278
Was that today?

08:42.330 --> 08:44.726
I remember doing it,
it was just so long ago.

08:44.881 --> 08:46.250
Hmm. Cool.

08:46.323 --> 08:48.492
Oh, hey, will you, um, call my phone?

08:48.546 --> 08:49.648
I don't know where it is.

08:49.679 --> 08:50.742
Of course, baby.

08:50.803 --> 08:53.024
And then after,
I could draw you a nice, hot bath

08:53.060 --> 08:54.326
and we could drink some wine.

08:54.443 --> 08:55.965
And we could watch "The Bachelorette"!

08:56.020 --> 08:58.051
I hear someone's in it
for the wrong reasons.

08:58.397 --> 09:00.162
<i>Rooni Schuman gave
it up on the first date.</i>

09:01.255 --> 09:02.668
<i>Rooni Schuman gave it
up on the first date.</i>

09:02.693 --> 09:04.598
Oh, here it is.

09:04.623 --> 09:06.287
- <i>Rooni Schuman gave it up</i>
- I got a new ringtone.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.651
<i>- On the first date.</i>
- Pretty cool, huh?

09:07.685 --> 09:08.916
- <i>Rooni Schu...</i>
- I'm so sorry, baby,

09:08.944 --> 09:10.568
but I had to do something to
get her to promote the show.

09:10.593 --> 09:13.102
She kept baiting me and baiting me
and saying I wasn't interesting.

09:13.165 --> 09:14.607
And by the way, it worked.

09:14.675 --> 09:17.543
The traffic on the website has
spiked after the interview.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.799
Unbelievable.

09:20.871 --> 09:22.885
<i>Rooni Schuman gave it
up on the first date.</i>

09:22.957 --> 09:23.973
<i>Rooni Schuman gave it up</i>

09:23.998 --> 09:25.464
- <i>on the first date.</i>
- It's your mom!

09:29.278 --> 09:31.199
All right, Benny-Bear,
I don't wanna say goodbye.

09:31.224 --> 09:32.256
You hang up first.

09:32.376 --> 09:33.618
Okay, bye.

09:33.643 --> 09:34.977
Was that Emily?

09:35.278 --> 09:37.157
Didn't she just leave
like 10 minutes ago?

09:37.228 --> 09:38.679
Well, she calls every couple hours.

09:38.762 --> 09:39.788
Sometimes every hour.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.696
Definitely after every meal and snack.

09:42.061 --> 09:44.335
We need to have a talk, Benny-Bear.

09:44.839 --> 09:47.197
I think Emily might want
to be your girlfriend.

09:47.299 --> 09:49.899
Mom, you probably think every
girl wants to be my girlfriend.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.222
No, I don't.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.425
She probably had some
Bagel Bites or something.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.563
Okay, you know what?

09:58.642 --> 10:00.107
At least one man in this house

10:00.200 --> 10:02.534
is going to be sensitive
and upfront with a woman.

10:02.747 --> 10:04.029
If Emily's really your friend,

10:04.105 --> 10:05.370
you don't want to lead her on.

10:05.596 --> 10:06.862
You have to make sure she knows

10:06.887 --> 10:08.490
that you don't like her like that, okay?

10:08.527 --> 10:09.560
Okay, fine.

10:09.585 --> 10:10.984
I'll talk to her, Mom. Geez.

10:11.512 --> 10:12.573
And be nice.

10:12.833 --> 10:15.605
And don't do it on a nationally
syndicated radio show.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.627
I feel like that wasn't for me.

10:18.727 --> 10:20.327
I've never seen Rooni this upset.

10:20.385 --> 10:22.152
- I gotta fix this, Ed.
- It's easy.

10:22.195 --> 10:24.495
You said something embarrassing
about her in public,

10:24.588 --> 10:27.037
so you gotta say something
that embarrasses you in public.

10:27.107 --> 10:28.844
What could I say that's
as embarrassing as that?

10:28.875 --> 10:31.172
Slippery Rick's Water Park, 1998...

10:31.208 --> 10:32.594
You puked on the log flume.

10:32.648 --> 10:33.666
It was so steep.

10:33.706 --> 10:35.268
The audition tape you and your mom made

10:35.293 --> 10:36.458
for "The Amazing Race."

10:36.591 --> 10:38.932
The time you cried to get
out of the jaywalking ticket.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.461
Okay, that one is a different story

10:40.548 --> 10:43.133
because I'd just seen "Titanic"
and I was very sensitive.

10:43.199 --> 10:44.398
That cop got me mid-weep.

10:45.028 --> 10:46.817
You know what, Rooni and I are adults.

10:46.872 --> 10:48.438
I'm just gonna go talk to her.

10:48.736 --> 10:51.830
Oh, you wired half your savings
to that Nigerian Prince!

10:51.931 --> 10:52.939
I hope he's okay.

10:52.964 --> 10:54.431
I haven't heard from him in a while.

10:58.757 --> 10:59.943
Hey, Benny-Bear!

11:00.031 --> 11:02.304
- We still on for rehearsal tonight?
- Uh, yeah.

11:02.369 --> 11:03.468
So, listen to this.

11:03.719 --> 11:05.852
My mom said the craziest
thing yesterday.

11:05.907 --> 11:08.274
She said that, you know,
'cause of how we FaceTime

11:08.326 --> 11:09.658
and that song that you wrote

11:09.687 --> 11:11.654
about how you're not
able to stop loving me,

11:11.686 --> 11:13.709
and uh, she said that maybe
you have a crush on me.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.951
But I told her we're just friends.

11:16.297 --> 11:17.303
Right?

11:17.740 --> 11:19.183
Yeah, for sure.

11:19.296 --> 11:21.027
Okay, great! Parents are dumb.

11:21.259 --> 11:22.691
I'll see you later for rehearsal.

11:23.675 --> 11:26.672
Yeah. Actually, I don't think I
can rehearse today after all.

11:26.913 --> 11:28.952
Oh. Maybe tomorrow, then?

11:29.176 --> 11:30.350
I don't know.

11:30.547 --> 11:33.547
I'll let you know, Benny... Ben.

11:47.191 --> 11:48.191
Sorry I'm late.

11:48.217 --> 11:49.902
One of my Uber passengers
just made me wait

11:49.927 --> 11:51.785
while he dumped his
suitcase in the East River.

11:52.036 --> 11:54.003
It was pretty heavy, but we got it done.

11:55.270 --> 11:57.301
I've been thinking about
your predicament, Deirdre.

11:57.326 --> 11:59.591
It's very tempting, that Cheer Up place.

11:59.647 --> 12:01.314
- Not to me. I'm not tempted.
- Really?

12:01.393 --> 12:03.459
'Cause it looks like you
brought in fancy water.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.120
Just because I don't want to work there

12:05.145 --> 12:07.625
doesn't mean that we can't have
some of those nice things here.

12:07.697 --> 12:08.711
Have some spa water.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.231
It's gonna be a good day.

12:13.747 --> 12:14.780
My bad!

12:16.316 --> 12:17.957
Have you seen the bathroom key?

12:18.118 --> 12:20.369
It's MIA. Here's a quarter.

12:20.514 --> 12:21.707
Take it to the Chevron.

12:21.732 --> 12:23.598
Tell 'em Ed sent you.

12:32.081 --> 12:33.815
Look.

12:34.175 --> 12:36.731
I know right about now, you're thinking

12:36.793 --> 12:38.770
it would be nice to work
at a place like Cheer Up.

12:38.830 --> 12:41.898
But there's a lot of great
stuff about this place, too.

12:41.965 --> 12:43.065
Mm-hmm?

12:43.220 --> 12:45.421
Just out of curiosity,
could you give me an example?

12:50.664 --> 12:52.414
I'm gonna have to get
back to you on that.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.441
Rooni, I'm sorry about
the interview, okay?

12:57.466 --> 12:59.213
I was stupid. I got
caught up in the moment,

12:59.259 --> 13:01.508
and I told everyone we had sex
on the first date, which we did.

13:01.533 --> 13:02.922
But I will never, ever again

13:02.951 --> 13:04.930
tell everyone we had
sex on the first date,

13:05.010 --> 13:06.443
which we did.

13:10.408 --> 13:12.411
I'd like that stricken
from the record, please.

13:12.513 --> 13:14.523
Hey, guys. I'm so sorry.

13:14.564 --> 13:16.726
Um, could you take this
to Dale's office, please?

13:16.765 --> 13:18.265
- I hate Dale.
- Me, too.

13:18.290 --> 13:19.905
Thank you. What are
you doing here, Alex?

13:19.930 --> 13:22.248
I don't want you to be mad at me,
and you still are, okay?

13:22.273 --> 13:23.600
I made a mistake, I said I'm sorry...

13:23.654 --> 13:25.168
How long are you going to make
me suffer for this interview?

13:25.219 --> 13:26.852
All right, you wanna know the truth?

13:26.889 --> 13:29.075
- Yes!
- I'm not even mad about the interview.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.179
I'm mad because ever since
you started this company...

13:31.204 --> 13:32.210
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

13:32.247 --> 13:34.114
If this is gonna be about the
company, gotta get it on tape.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.461
It's gonna be good. And go.

13:38.205 --> 13:39.490
Use it.

13:39.540 --> 13:41.573
Talk into the mic.

13:41.698 --> 13:44.166
Oh, my God, this is exactly
what I'm talking about!

13:44.479 --> 13:46.921
Everything you do now
is about the company!

13:46.962 --> 13:48.195
- I want our life back.
- Fine.

13:48.234 --> 13:49.640
Would it help if I told everyone...

13:49.677 --> 13:51.844
Hey, I cried after I saw "Titanic"!

13:52.265 --> 13:54.668
There was plenty of room
for Leo on that door!

13:54.711 --> 13:56.856
Shame on Rose! Shame on Rose.

13:56.948 --> 13:58.281
Alex, I got a lot of work to do.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.238
<i>Rooni Schuman gave it
up on the first date.</i>

14:00.270 --> 14:01.528
Will you please change that?

14:01.562 --> 14:03.499
Ben showed me and I forgot how!

14:03.546 --> 14:05.341
You just go to settings, and then sound.

14:05.433 --> 14:08.260
Change it to something not upsetting,
like "Ding!" or "Do do do do!"

14:08.664 --> 14:10.587
<i>The hardest thing about
my conversation with Rooni</i>

14:10.612 --> 14:12.594
<i>was that I wasn't sure how to
fix what was bothering her.</i>

14:12.727 --> 14:14.453
Of course, I'm obsessed
with the company.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.524
I-I want it to work. What am I
supposed to do, let it fail?

14:16.560 --> 14:18.255
The only thing that you're
capable of failing at

14:18.287 --> 14:19.576
is not succeeding.

14:19.706 --> 14:21.005
Thank you.

14:21.255 --> 14:23.514
Remember at Cheer Up,
when we'd leave for the day

14:23.551 --> 14:25.241
and we wouldn't think about it again

14:25.268 --> 14:26.788
until we walked in the next morning?

14:27.264 --> 14:29.238
By the way, how was Cheer Up?
I forgot to ask you.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.580
They're not gonna promote the show.

14:30.611 --> 14:31.973
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

14:32.012 --> 14:33.711
When I left, I flipped a few desks.

14:33.877 --> 14:35.735
Or at least I tried to.
They're very heavy.

14:36.212 --> 14:37.245
- Mahogany.
- Mahogany.

14:37.313 --> 14:38.649
It's such a heavy, heavy wood.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.812
Yeah, very dense.

14:39.889 --> 14:41.455
But do you remember how easy that was?

14:41.509 --> 14:43.050
The only time Rooni was ever mad at me

14:43.075 --> 14:44.341
was when I spent too much time

14:44.385 --> 14:45.684
putting the kids to sleep.

14:46.357 --> 14:48.419
Maybe sometimes, you need to act like

14:48.466 --> 14:49.794
it's the way it used to be,

14:49.840 --> 14:51.912
even though it's not
and it never will be.

14:52.437 --> 14:54.303
Sometimes, maybe you need to block

14:54.328 --> 14:57.718
all the rest of that stuff
out and just focus on her.

14:58.673 --> 15:00.108
Make her feel special.

15:02.405 --> 15:03.471
You know, you're right.

15:03.894 --> 15:06.582
You're so right. She probably feels
like I'm taking her for granted.

15:07.027 --> 15:08.657
Maybe we can't go back to the old days,

15:08.717 --> 15:11.837
but there's no reason
we can't visit, right?

15:13.110 --> 15:14.348
Let's finish this later.

15:17.315 --> 15:18.539
Thank you.

15:19.317 --> 15:21.107
I don't know what I'd do without you.

15:32.468 --> 15:33.686
Did the hermit crab die?

15:34.669 --> 15:36.217
How would we know, Mom?

15:36.294 --> 15:37.493
How would we know?

15:37.803 --> 15:38.906
You were right.

15:38.975 --> 15:40.852
Emily did have feelings for me.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.498
Well, why are you sad?

15:42.543 --> 15:44.165
I thought you didn't like her like that.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.423
I thought I didn't,

15:45.961 --> 15:48.261
but it's like I didn't know
what I had until it was gone.

15:49.154 --> 15:50.717
Should I write a song about that?

15:51.038 --> 15:52.804
I think someone might've
beat you to it, bud.

15:53.226 --> 15:55.489
Maybe you should just call
her and tell her how you feel.

15:55.592 --> 15:56.601
Oh, great.

15:56.693 --> 15:57.892
More advice from the person

15:57.961 --> 15:59.889
who told me to break up
with the love of my life.

16:00.256 --> 16:01.397
Anyways, it wouldn't work.

16:01.422 --> 16:03.178
- She won't even talk to me.
- Okay.

16:03.245 --> 16:05.045
Well, then you gotta dig deep, Ben.

16:05.183 --> 16:06.782
Think of a way to make it up to her...

16:07.087 --> 16:08.645
Something that would mean a lot,

16:08.738 --> 16:10.622
and not just to anybody, but to Emily.

16:10.902 --> 16:11.926
What would that be?

16:12.075 --> 16:13.541
You'll think of something.

16:23.987 --> 16:25.219
You sure you want to do this?

16:25.321 --> 16:26.627
I'm sure.

16:26.797 --> 16:28.430
Well, good luck to you.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.681
Thank you both for this opportunity.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.830
You made the right choice.

17:20.867 --> 17:22.205
Oh, we should grab a drink later.

17:22.246 --> 17:23.712
- I'm straight again!
- This week.

17:26.616 --> 17:28.616
You got my number.

17:36.394 --> 17:38.526
Hello, my name's Deirdre Riordan.

17:38.594 --> 17:40.019
I used to work here at Cheer Up,

17:40.055 --> 17:41.955
and recently, they invited me back.

17:42.072 --> 17:43.267
It's a very nice place,

17:43.292 --> 17:45.298
and they have made me
feel very comfortable.

17:46.302 --> 17:48.669
But sometimes,
"comfortable" isn't enough

17:48.771 --> 17:51.004
because at the end of the day,
it's about people...

17:51.098 --> 17:53.599
<i>The people who you admire and trust</i>

17:53.624 --> 17:54.990
<i>and who you'd do anything for,</i>

17:55.066 --> 17:57.366
<i>even if it means working
in a decrepit warehouse</i>

17:57.475 --> 17:59.275
<i>that smells like dogs and black mold.</i>

17:59.429 --> 18:00.447
Atta girl.

18:00.642 --> 18:03.343
Anyway, if you want to
listen to the kind of show

18:03.424 --> 18:05.782
that comes from people
with that kind of passion,

18:05.870 --> 18:08.704
I encourage you to listen to
Alex Schuman's new podcast.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.058
It's called "Our Family's Business,"

18:11.094 --> 18:12.899
available soon wherever
you download podcasts.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.403
I'm gonna kill you, Deirds!

18:19.196 --> 18:20.595
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

18:23.906 --> 18:25.372
Yeah!

18:29.345 --> 18:30.976
Hey, what are you doing here?

18:31.045 --> 18:32.784
Let me just quickly make
sure no one's here.

18:33.467 --> 18:34.479
Okay, good.

18:34.550 --> 18:36.283
Rooni, I am so sorry

18:36.308 --> 18:38.412
that work is such a big
part of our lives right now,

18:38.440 --> 18:40.646
and I'm sorry I can't make that go away.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.690
But one thing I can do

18:42.759 --> 18:45.639
is make sure that there are
some things that are just ours.

18:46.545 --> 18:47.937
I can do better on that.

18:48.468 --> 18:50.687
I promise. You deserve it.

18:51.167 --> 18:52.333
Thank you.

18:52.528 --> 18:54.262
And thank you for not recording this.

18:54.327 --> 18:57.428
Yes, I am purse-less,
just like in the old days.

18:58.103 --> 18:59.173
Speaking of which,

18:59.198 --> 19:01.204
I was wondering if I
could take you on a date.

19:02.111 --> 19:03.611
What'd you have in mind?

19:04.077 --> 19:06.569
I was thinking Chinese take-out.

19:09.752 --> 19:11.711
I can't believe you found this car.

19:11.792 --> 19:14.459
It's almost exactly like that
piece of crap from college.

19:14.592 --> 19:16.459
This is really sweet, babe.

19:17.270 --> 19:18.846
It's too bad you couldn't make it rain.

19:19.912 --> 19:21.679
Hold that thought.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.712
Not bad, Mr. Schuman.

19:38.951 --> 19:41.315
Though I'm pretty sure you
just locked us in here.

19:44.536 --> 19:46.118
Okay, I didn't mean to.

19:46.158 --> 19:49.526
But it's 2018, and we have
our cellphones, which...

19:50.995 --> 19:52.426
are on the front seat.

19:52.528 --> 19:54.662
I think we may be here awhile.

19:54.764 --> 19:56.297
I guess so.

19:57.339 --> 19:59.733
I wonder what we should do now.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.574
<i>And what happened next, well...</i>

20:05.828 --> 20:08.629
<i>that's none of your business.</i>

20:16.606 --> 20:19.160
There she is!

20:20.156 --> 20:21.802
Deirdre, that was the greatest heist

20:21.849 --> 20:23.282
in the history of radio.

20:23.329 --> 20:25.536
Hey, it's a startup, right?
Whatever needs to be done.

20:25.561 --> 20:27.361
- Well, we got you something.
- Yeah, we did.

20:29.470 --> 20:32.337
Just what I wanted! The LR2400XC!

20:32.362 --> 20:35.047
It has facial recognition
for up to five faces.

20:35.072 --> 20:36.996
- I call I get to be one of the faces.
- Me, too.

20:37.021 --> 20:38.045
Okay, two faces left.

20:38.078 --> 20:40.803
Also, we know you've been driving
a car to make some extra cash.

20:40.887 --> 20:42.842
That don't sit right with me, so...

20:43.620 --> 20:45.020
- got you some mace.
- Yeah.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.395
Oh.

20:46.420 --> 20:48.782
That's the good stuff. It burns
everything, even your ears.

20:48.945 --> 20:50.007
Great.

20:50.032 --> 20:51.765
Just don't mace yourself accidentally.

20:51.826 --> 20:53.735
Oh, that's another
embarrassing thing you did.

20:53.823 --> 20:55.456
Yeah, I thought it was breath spray.

20:55.495 --> 20:57.785
Now I always double-check
the label before I pump.

20:58.386 --> 20:59.668
This one is good.
