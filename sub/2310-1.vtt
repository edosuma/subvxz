00:40.280 --> 00:42.942
What did you just say?

00:45.600 --> 00:49.388
Can I have a pen?
I can't talk without a pen.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.861
That makes a lot of sense.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.919
When you're crazy...

01:03.920 --> 01:07.679
you sometimes have to let
your hands do the talking.

01:07.680 --> 01:13.279
The way you deal with this is you learn to
enjoy being a passenger in your own body,

01:13.280 --> 01:16.479
They told me I have
multiple personalities.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.039
They told me I don't fit in.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.439
But in a war between
individuality and conformity...

01:22.440 --> 01:25.959
the individual is always outgunned.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.319
The conformists have
machines on their side.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.439
They think they've got
all the angles covered.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.359
But they forgot two important things.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.864
Crazy people, we don't
play by the rules.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.620
And there are always side effects.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.704
Detective Moss?

03:09.600 --> 03:12.182
Jennifer.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.463
Where's my chair?

03:24.120 --> 03:27.239
Victims' psych profiles.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.319
- Where'd you get ahold of these?
- Got any aspirin?

03:30.320 --> 03:32.629
- No.
- Who's this?

03:33.720 --> 03:37.359
Suki, apartment 64 upstairs.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.319
Are you a psychologist?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.799
My name's Jennifer Silk.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.159
I'm a criminal psychologist.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.079
I'm not a criminal.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.399
Why don't you tell me what happened.
From the beginning.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.479
That's not always the
best way to tell a story.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.479
No? Okay, well why don't we start
at the end then. Here. Dead.

03:55.480 --> 04:00.479
Dead, dead and dead.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.639
That's a lot of dead
nutters in one place...

04:02.640 --> 04:05.142
and it all happened
after you moved in.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.829
He's not dead.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.559
Go and find this one,
would you, Detective?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.949
Make sure he doesn't go anywhere.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.959
Tell me about Juniper Towers, Suki.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.383
Why are you here?

04:30.040 --> 04:33.589
It's a halfway house for the
mentally and socially inept.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.319
It's kind of a psychiatric
version of purgatory.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.079
You're out of your padded cell,
but you haven't really qualified...

04:41.080 --> 04:43.867
for a place in the real world yet.

04:46.560 --> 04:50.143
They give you a room if you
show a willingness to conform.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.079
You might still be under the impression
you can think for yourself...

04:55.080 --> 04:58.311
but you do time here
until you get over it.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.999
The good news is...

05:01.000 --> 05:05.346
if you get a key to the tower,
it means you're getting better.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.279
You're still a social leper,
but at least you're on the way up.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.279
What are you doing on the stairs?

05:53.280 --> 05:56.431
- I don't like elevators.
- It's not safe.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.759
You want my coat?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.224
God, no.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.999
Don't take it personally.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.639
She's very fashion conscious.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.639
She wouldn't be caught
dead in that coat...

06:14.640 --> 06:17.620
or anything else for that matter.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.479
You moving in?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.999
Yeah. Suki, top floor.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.679
Oh. I'm Cleo.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.919
Bipolar sex addict.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.239
That's Emily. She has a
pathological fear of clothing.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.239
- What's your thing?
- Disassociative identity disorder.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.999
Fantastic.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.199
We don't have one of those.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.239
Welcome to the suicide suites.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.879
You must be high risk.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.870
No, I'm...

06:50.200 --> 06:52.839
What do you mean, "high risk"?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.999
Come down and see me later.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.344
I'll show you my secret
milk bath recipe.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.630
Stay off the stairs.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.946
- Help.
- Emily?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.599
Yeah, I know. Stay off the stairs.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.319
It doesn't matter.
We won't survive this place.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.029
You might as well jump.
Everybody does.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.439
You can't live here.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.919
- This is just crazy.
- Stay still.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.078
- I control you.
- Get out before it's too late.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.799
- You're just a rat in a cage.
- Get out before it's too late.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.639
This place will suck
the life out of you.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.279
- You ought to jump too.
- ...jump too.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.020
- Everybody does.
- Everybody does.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.119
This is the real crazy.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.987
Anxiety and vomit.

09:11.960 --> 09:16.039
It's disappearing into a dark corner
where no one can reach you.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.747
It's being ugly and stupid...

09:19.640 --> 09:21.824
and alone.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.999
It's wishing you were
back in the hospital.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.479
Her vitals are off the scale.
What's happening to her?

09:30.480 --> 09:32.519
The machine just burned
out another identity.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.919
- Leave it on.
- We have to abort.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.468
Her heart's stopped.
I've got no pulse.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.186
What's that? Did you see?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.839
It's the Scribbler.
She's surfaced again.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.119
It's okay, Suki. Stay still.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.279
Check the counter.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.879
It's on nine.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.919
Then we've successfully eradicated
two more identities. Do you concur?

09:58.200 --> 10:02.625
Suki? It's Dr. Satomi.
Can you hear me?

10:03.120 --> 10:06.385
Get up. How do you feel?

10:06.880 --> 10:09.428
Oh, hold on. Look at me.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.430
Say "ah."

10:14.200 --> 10:17.519
Ah!

10:21.040 --> 10:25.039
<i>Oh, why should I kill myself?</i>

10:25.040 --> 10:27.039
<i>Baby, I'm tryin'</i>

10:31.880 --> 10:33.239
We can't live here.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.959
- We can't live here.
- There's a 38% suicide rate.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.959
- Did you see...
- You're falling apart.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.879
Don't you see you're falling apart?

10:40.880 --> 10:42.559
That'll be us next.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.639
- This place is a dump.
- Don't worry.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.239
This place is a dump.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.239
- Shh. Shut up.
- No one is gonna take care of you.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.799
- We're not safe here.
- No one's gonna take care of you.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.759
Get out. Get out.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.069
Run.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.799
Dance for me.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.589
Dance.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.199
Hogan? What are you doing here?

11:22.200 --> 11:25.679
- I brought sugar.
- I don't do sugar.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.990
That's not what you said last time.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.679
And I thought Juniper
Tower was a female block.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.439
Every henhouse needs a rooster.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.261
I checked the wrong box.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.639
Paperwork hasn't been your
strong point either, has it?

11:45.640 --> 11:48.639
Maybe I've got it right,
and everybody else has it backwards.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.799
Yeah. That attitude will keep
you off Sinclair's radar.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.799
- He let me out, didn't he?
- I can't imagine why.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.359
Anyone who can't write
a proper list...

11:57.360 --> 12:00.625
is surely a danger to modern society.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.039
Oh, beautiful, you look like crap.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.399
Are you sure you're ready to
fly out of the cuckoo's nest?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.999
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.439
I'm just saying most people leave this
place in the back of an ambulance.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.919
So what about you?
I thought you were cured.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.199
Why are you still here?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.359
Ding.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.319
Got myself a new entry
in the accident book.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.279
Fuck.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.319
- Hogan, why?
- Bad hair day?

12:27.320 --> 12:30.359
No. I mean, why'd you
cut across instead of down?

12:30.360 --> 12:33.679
- You're such a faker.
- Oh, you'd be crazy not to be.

12:33.680 --> 12:37.999
This place is full of girls with daddy
issues, and I've got the penthouse suite.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.959
I'd do anything to stay here.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.679
In fact, I'm thinking
of trying out...

12:41.680 --> 12:43.679
that multiple personality
thing of yours next.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.279
Could you give me some pointers?

12:45.280 --> 12:47.519
You can't do multiple personalities.
You barely got one.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.399
It's good to see you, Hogan.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.426
You're the only sane person I know.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.599
Did you know her?

13:04.600 --> 13:09.479
We were friends with benefits,
except we weren't friends.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.919
I don't mind the weird stuff, but she'd
never take off the fucking bunny ears.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.719
- No. I meant the girl who jumped.
- Oh.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.759
No.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.359
Well, sort of.
We had a brief encounter.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.839
Jesus.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.959
Do you ever put it away?

13:23.960 --> 13:26.959
I am providing a service.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.399
Trying to keep everyone's
mind off suicide.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.221
No one else is looking out for us.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.599
We're all subject to the
same risk assessment.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.079
You dive out a fifth-floor window...

13:41.080 --> 13:43.879
you got a chance of surviving,
but your busted legs...

13:43.880 --> 13:46.759
are gonna cut into the
Christmas party budget.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.079
Oh, but if you dive from up here...

13:53.520 --> 13:57.183
It's one less benefit
check they gotta sign.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.119
- Yes.
- No, no. Not again.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.599
- No, not again.
- You know you want it.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.839
No, I don't.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.599
You want it.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.119
He's not our type.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.759
- You could have some.
- He's not our type.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.679
- We deserve it.
- Grow up.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.224
Come on.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.704
Shut up!

14:33.120 --> 14:34.959
Fuck him like your ass is on fire.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.439
Fuck him.

14:36.440 --> 14:42.470
Fuck him like your ass is on fire.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.959
His name's Hogan.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.239
Somehow he's the only male
resident in the whole block.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.319
Where is he?

14:59.320 --> 15:01.039
He's right outside.
He's not going anywhere.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.079
Who's watching him?

15:03.080 --> 15:05.559
- He's not a suspect.
- Why not?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.142
Because she did it.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.182
What happened next?

16:25.520 --> 16:28.229
I think you chipped
a tooth this time.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.079
So you knew Hogan from before.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.079
We were at the funny farm together.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.439
And this is what you people
do here, is it, huh?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.119
You run around naked having
casual sex with each other?

16:53.120 --> 16:55.199
- Technically, that wasn't me.
- Oh, right, right.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.199
That's one of your
multiple personalities.

16:57.200 --> 17:02.119
What's that like being somebody
one day, somebody else the next?

17:02.120 --> 17:05.039
You ever been in love?

17:05.040 --> 17:07.079
You find yourself acting
out of character...

17:07.079 --> 17:09.279
betraying everything that
you've ever believed in...

17:09.280 --> 17:12.670
and you can't stop because
you don't want to.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.827
It's like that.

17:23.359 --> 17:26.358
You're under Dr. Sinclair.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.839
What's his treatment?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.799
Siamese burn therapy.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.790
Sounds painful.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.879
It is.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.039
I know that it hurts, Suki...

17:52.040 --> 17:55.039
but if you will do just one more
session on the main unit...

17:55.040 --> 17:57.879
then we can move you out of
here and into Juniper Tower...

17:57.880 --> 18:01.799
where you can continue
your therapy at home...

18:01.800 --> 18:05.599
with this portable burn unit.

18:05.600 --> 18:09.999
- How do you feel?
- Why don't you come over here and find out.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.159
That's not, Suki.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.679
Do you have to... Dr. Sinclair!

18:16.680 --> 18:19.599
Come on, Dr. Sinclair.
I love it battery-powered.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.119
Arm.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.599
I said the therapy is working.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.919
- How do you feel?
- Toilet trained.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.799
I've been losing skills.
Can't roll my tongue anymore...

18:35.800 --> 18:37.559
and I swear I used
to be right-handed.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.719
You're worried you're
becoming ordinary.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.199
- Aren't you?
- Don't you want to fit in?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.399
Apparently not as much
as you want me to.

18:44.400 --> 18:48.639
Getting cured and becoming socially
acceptable are two sides of the same coin.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.919
Without conformity,
society slips into confusion.

18:51.920 --> 18:56.039
Confusion's a word we created for
an order we don't understand yet.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.622
- What's that?
- Henry Miller.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.239
I think he was predicting
the chaos theory.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.559
- Wake up.
- What did you do?

19:15.560 --> 19:17.079
- What did you do?
- What did you do?

19:17.080 --> 19:19.479
- You little whore. You slut.
- What did you do?

19:19.480 --> 19:20.839
- Whore.
- Wake up.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.919
You little whore.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.399
- You slutty mutt.
- You whore.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.425
You slut.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.479
Aren't you supposed to pop
a pill before the big event?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.479
I'm not that old.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.679
- What do they got you on?
- Usual.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.279
Pick 'n' mix selection box.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.119
- You?
- Something new.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.703
- New drugs?
- A machine.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.824
"Siamese Burn Module."

20:02.440 --> 20:08.359
"Burns away excess identities in patients
with dissociative identity disorder."

20:08.360 --> 20:09.959
Are you kidding me?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.319
"Regulates synaptic
firing patterns...

20:12.320 --> 20:14.959
by running prolonged
low-level voltage...

20:14.960 --> 20:16.719
through targeted areas of the brain."

20:16.720 --> 20:20.110
- it's an E.C.T. unit.
- No, it's not. Don't have a flashback.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.639
"Brings undesirable
personalities under control...

20:25.640 --> 20:30.319
that can either be
assimilated or annihilated."

20:30.320 --> 20:32.839
These personalities may
be undesirable to you...

20:32.840 --> 20:35.599
but they're my friends.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.399
Most of 'em.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.959
"Side effects may include
cardiac arrhythmia...

20:39.960 --> 20:42.839
memory loss, seizures
and incontinence."

20:42.840 --> 20:45.439
You piss your pants?

20:45.440 --> 20:48.239
Have you... Have you even read this?

20:48.240 --> 20:51.159
Isn't it time you went home?

20:51.160 --> 20:54.599
For some reason, the part of me that goes
for you ducks out for the small talk...

20:54.600 --> 20:57.910
and leaves me to pick
up the wet patches.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.479
This machine isn't gonna help you.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.599
It's gonna make you boring
like everybody else.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.944
Gonna be no fun when you're cured.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.110
Hey.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.263
Thanks for the sugar.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.559
Don't do it.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.199
- Don't give in.
- What have we ever done to you?

21:43.200 --> 21:45.319
- Don't do it.
- What have we ever done to you?

21:45.320 --> 21:47.399
- What have we ever done...
- Don't let them bore you.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.039
- You'll die.
- You'll be next.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.479
- You'll die.
- Don't be like you're special.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.119
- You're special.
- You're nothing.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.239
You're special. Don't be
another cog in their machines.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.959
Be yourself.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.919
- What are you gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?

22:03.560 --> 22:05.839
Why are you so afraid to be yourself?

22:05.840 --> 22:07.759
- Fine. Push the button.
- Push the button.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.719
- See if we care.
- Do it, you stupid bitch.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.199
- Do it, you stupid bitch.
- Push the button.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.239
- Push the button.
- Push the button. Kill us all.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.159
Push the button.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.119
...button. Push the button.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.359
See if we care.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.679
Do it, you stupid bitch.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.919
Push the button and kill us all.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.785
Punch it.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.185
Whoa!

23:24.680 --> 23:28.159
Suki, wake up.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.919
Something happened.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.839
- Something's happened.
- What did you do?

23:31.840 --> 23:33.990
- What did you...
- Wake up.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.319
The machine. The machine.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.839
What have you done to the machine?

24:00.840 --> 24:03.439
Sinclair won't be happy.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.199
He'll send me back to the nuthouse.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.146
He'll send you back to the nuthouse.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.879
- Siamese burn.
- It hurts.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.519
It doesn't hurt all of us.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.999
- The Scribbler.
- The Scribbler.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.199
- It was the Scribbler.
- Look at the handwriting.

24:18.200 --> 24:22.182
- The Scribbler.
- It's always the quiet ones.

24:35.720 --> 24:39.399
- Bates Motel.
- Suki, it's Dr. Sinclair.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.999
- Is everything okay?
- Why? What have you heard?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.239
I thought I'd give you a
couple of days to settle in...

24:44.240 --> 24:47.119
A couple of days?

24:47.120 --> 24:50.079
- What day is it?
- It's Monday.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.559
Oh, shit.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.759
Did you know there was
another suicide yesterday?

24:53.760 --> 24:54.599
Who?

24:54.600 --> 24:56.704
Another jumper.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.759
You guys ever think that maybe you
should seal these windows shut?

25:05.760 --> 25:09.039
Listen, I'm coming there on
Friday to check on the module.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.383
You know, just hang in there, okay?

25:36.120 --> 25:38.907
Are you all right?

25:42.280 --> 25:44.479
The dog said what?

25:44.480 --> 25:46.519
Relax, Detective. It's normal.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.279
- What part of this is normal?
- The disassociative mind...

25:49.280 --> 25:54.639
can sometimes transfer auditory hallucinations
onto objects like animals or toys.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.519
Helps the patient
localize the experience.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.479
So she's a ventriloquist now?

25:59.480 --> 26:01.159
You said you lost a day.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.799
And during that convenient
blackout, somebody else died.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.463
- The bunny.
- Did the bunny talk as well?

26:10.080 --> 26:12.150
The bunny.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.919
- Did you know her?
- I met her once.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.991
Did she seem suicidal to you?

26:32.520 --> 26:35.559
You might as well jump.
Everybody does.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.519
Actually, yeah.

26:38.520 --> 26:42.183
Oh, come on. You gave
her that one on a plate.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.799
After the blackout...

26:44.800 --> 26:47.879
you said one of the alters had
been removed by this machine.

26:47.880 --> 26:51.031
- Another two.
- So you were cured.

26:51.680 --> 26:54.660
Not even close.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.319
What, that's it?

26:57.320 --> 26:59.279
No chitchat. No small talk.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.039
Where you going?

27:02.040 --> 27:03.399
Out.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.439
Can you pick me up something to eat?
I'm fucking starving.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.039
Meaty Duos or Chudleys, not that
small dog tender morsel shit.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.959
And a pack of...

27:34.320 --> 27:36.130
Are you getting in?

27:53.600 --> 27:55.919
Hello?

27:55.920 --> 27:58.479
I only get stuck a
couple of times a day.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.519
Come on. Take a chance.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.599
There's plenty of room.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.439
- I'll go slow.
- I don't think so.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.439
Then use the stairs, bitch.
Don't waste my time.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.783
Bite me.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.039
This is awkward.

28:19.040 --> 28:23.119
Say something clever.
You could be friends.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.239
Oh, God, she is hot.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.959
- Don't say that.
- Oh, but she is so beautiful.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.479
That top doesn't go with those boots.

28:32.480 --> 28:36.189
Fuck you,
you attention-seeking bitch.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.799
- Going up or down?
- We're on the top floor. There is no up.

28:44.800 --> 28:48.827
- That's a narrow-minded attitude.
- I'll take the stairs.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.667
Good luck with that.

29:19.040 --> 29:22.225
Are you okay? You tripped.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.199
What the fuck?

29:25.200 --> 29:27.941
Have you seen my dog?

29:29.040 --> 29:32.839
He's about so high, brown and white.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.519
Does he speak with a Cockney accent?

29:35.520 --> 29:39.199
- No.
- Then no. I haven't seen him.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.719
- What's his name?
- Hogan.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.109
My doggy's name is Hogan.

29:58.440 --> 30:02.387
If you see him, do send him home.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.679
They made me wear this.

30:09.680 --> 30:13.279
The locals are complaining again,
and they singled me out.

30:13.280 --> 30:18.422
What kind of species aren't proud
of the shape of its own body?

30:22.080 --> 30:24.559
What happened to you?

30:24.560 --> 30:27.142
Where have you been all day?

30:30.400 --> 30:33.199
Open up, asshole.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.862
Open the fucking door!

30:37.560 --> 30:41.189
Oh. You met Alice.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.199
The elevator hates me.
There's a lunatic loose on the stairs.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.319
I'm never gonna make it out
of this building alive, am I?

30:48.320 --> 30:51.959
- Probably not.
- Fantastic.

30:57.440 --> 31:01.279
I'm sorry. I should've
warned you about Alice.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.279
She can be territorial.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.799
She's a sociopath.

31:04.800 --> 31:09.159
Uh, she's schizoaffective and
kind of the jealous type.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.830
Don't tell me you two are an item.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.430
Well, we were for an hour.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.639
Oh, that's right.

31:20.640 --> 31:24.839
You can barely hold down
a long-term conversation.

31:24.840 --> 31:28.559
What was I thinking?

31:28.560 --> 31:29.959
Well, what do you expect?

31:29.960 --> 31:31.999
Every time I get close to someone...

31:32.000 --> 31:34.479
they commit suicide
five minutes later.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.279
I'm surprised you haven't jumped yet.

31:36.280 --> 31:40.479
Wow, I like what you've
done with the place.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.919
I have gadgets.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.264
Well, I hope you didn't
give any of 'em to me.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.239
Hey, put those on. I rigged
an antenna up on the roof.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.079
You'd be amazed at the weird
shit you can hear up here.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.799
Distant number stations,
backwards music channels...

31:55.800 --> 31:57.679
cryptic messages in the white noise.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.751
Ooh, have a listen.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.639
Almost down to the last two.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.919
The yin and the yang.

32:08.920 --> 32:12.799
She's bigger than you think,
and getting bigger every day.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.199
One day soon she's going to spring
out of the top of your head...

32:16.200 --> 32:18.589
like a jack-in-the-box.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.839
That's a little bit too weird for me.

32:21.840 --> 32:25.105
I haven't even plugged it in yet.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.879
Anyway, I need to
borrow a video camera.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.599
Okay.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.039
But if you're thinking...

32:32.040 --> 32:34.399
of trying to get incriminating
evidence against Alice, forget it.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.879
No one will care. It's easier
to stay off the stairs.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.479
It has nothing to do with her.

32:38.480 --> 32:41.381
This is more of a personal project.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.199
Do you want me to come
by in 10 minutes?

32:45.200 --> 32:48.146
Pretend I'm there to fix
the dishwasher? Hmm?

32:49.040 --> 32:51.304
This one's a solo act.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.989
- I'm borrowing this too.
- Make me a copy.

33:00.720 --> 33:05.839
And then that whack job pushed
me down the stairs again.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.399
Can you believe that?

33:07.400 --> 33:09.639
She's got a warped sense of humor.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.679
That's why I moved out.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.279
This whole building's
full of fucking lunatics.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.559
All I want is a couch
and a bit of love.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.999
But what do I get?

33:18.000 --> 33:22.399
Self-harmers, Christ complexes
and shit smeared on the walls.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.279
You people are disgusting.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.759
They tell me not to listen
to the voices in my head.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.759
What do you have to say about that?

33:28.760 --> 33:31.399
I say fuck 'em. They're your voices.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.399
If you can't trust yourself,
who can you trust?

33:34.400 --> 33:36.550
Good point.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.063
This one.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.119
- Emily.
- She was young, very beautiful.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.319
Must've had a lot to live for.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.478
- Where were you when she died?
- I don't know.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.039
- I think I do.
- Go back to the machine.

34:21.040 --> 34:24.478
You didn't know who modified it or
what it was going to do to you...

34:24.480 --> 34:27.639
- but you used it anyway.
- The dog made me do it.

34:27.639 --> 34:30.302
You really are out of
your mind, aren't you?

34:31.719 --> 34:32.998
Duh.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.478
Have you both read the latest
report on Patient 107?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.918
Her name is Suki.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.159
Our latest concern is her suspicion
that one of her alters...

34:43.159 --> 34:46.039
the identity she refers to as the
Scribbler, may in fact be inhuman.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.039
Or superhuman.
The Scribbler thinks it can fly.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.719
Under its influence,
Suki could become very dangerous.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.839
This might be Patient
99 all over again.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.998
Thank you for the gentle
reminder, Dr. Kareem.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.759
But if Patient 99's machine
therapy had not failed...

34:58.760 --> 35:01.519
we would not have stumbled
on the burn process.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.119
This time we are not trying
to cure the incurable.

35:04.120 --> 35:09.519
What makes you think your new machine
will be any better than the last one?

35:10.200 --> 35:14.319
We will focus on burning out as many
alters as possible for now, Dr. Kareem.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.519
And if the Scribbler
survives the treatment...

35:16.520 --> 35:19.199
Suki will still have a
50-50 chance at control.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.599
So now we're playing the odds?

35:20.600 --> 35:22.719
We all live with duality every day.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.879
We're all a little yin
and a little yang.

35:24.880 --> 35:28.350
What if Suki's yang is homicidal?

35:29.680 --> 35:32.911
It won't affect the experiment.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.829
Hey, wake up.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.959
Oh, you're one of them, aren't you?

35:53.960 --> 35:56.959
From in there?

35:56.960 --> 36:00.639
Why don't you get a job and
take control of your life?

36:00.640 --> 36:02.919
You won't be able to hang
around here forever.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.799
- Who's this asshole?
- He's one of them.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.599
He's just a drone.
He doesn't know any better.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.239
- Break his neck.
- Cut his throat.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.079
- Kick him in the nuts.
- You'd be doing the world a favor.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.599
You'd be doing the world a favor.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.119
Is he bothering you?

36:15.120 --> 36:16.399
- It's Cleo.
- She's one of us.

36:16.400 --> 36:20.799
- Oh, we love her.
- Is she parked illegally?

36:20.800 --> 36:23.359
Is she sitting on a yellow line?

36:23.360 --> 36:24.799
I... No.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.759
That's right, little man.

36:26.760 --> 36:30.399
There's only one line that separates
your pathetic little world from ours...

36:30.400 --> 36:33.039
- and you just crossed it.
- Well, I-l didn't mean to.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.559
So why don't you keep your
rules and your regulations...

36:36.560 --> 36:39.399
and your parking
citations to yourself...

36:39.400 --> 36:45.679
and we'll keep our group sex and
mutilation and cannibalism to us?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.159
Capisce?

36:47.160 --> 36:48.679
Is-Is that thing poisonous?

36:50.520 --> 36:52.799
It's not the snake you
need to worry about.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.199
You don't know where I've been.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.479
Shit.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.639
Is it Wednesday?

37:09.640 --> 37:12.222
Fuck if I know.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.519
I heard you were afraid of elevators.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.261
Is that supposed to be funny?

37:38.520 --> 37:43.105
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for my dog.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.559
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

37:47.560 --> 37:50.199
He has fleas, you know.
Fleas and ticks and rabies.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.919
- Is that why you named him Hogan?
- Hogan's my friend.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.599
We were friends since
before you got here.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.359
Everything was fine
until you showed up.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.759
Soon as you moved in, people
started diving out the windows.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.399
- What does that tell you?
- I don't know, Alice.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.599
Maybe my deodorant doesn't work.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.785
Where were you last night
when Emily jumped?

38:10.200 --> 38:12.039
Emily jumped?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.079
- Who do you have in there?
- No one.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.821
But the security chain's on.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.959
Locked yourself out from the inside.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.719
Just how crazy are you?

38:26.720 --> 38:29.063
Good question.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.479
- It wasn't us.
- It wasn't us.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.759
The Scribbler did it.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.599
She's been busy.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.399
- She's crazy.
- Don't trust her.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.999
We know what she's doing.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.079
She's rewired everything so
she can get out, selfish bitch.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.079
She's using the machine herself.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.239
She wants to be free.
She wants to be free.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.629
- Permanently.
- Permanently.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.909
What?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.959
Where's the camera?

39:28.560 --> 39:30.949
What?

39:40.640 --> 39:44.303
Hogan's gonna blow a fuse of his
own when he gets a load of this.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.659
What happened?

39:49.000 --> 39:52.799
You were supposed to be on
the lookout, you little shit.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.906
Hello? Anybody home?

40:19.920 --> 40:22.879
Oh, well, I don't suppose...

40:22.880 --> 40:26.159
you have anything to
say about this either.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.221
Shit.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.999
Oh.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.949
You think he'll go for it?

41:38.200 --> 41:41.279
I think you could be wearing a gorilla
suit and it'd still be a sure thing.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.679
Hey, where you been?

41:42.680 --> 41:46.079
You missed Emily's grand exit.

41:46.080 --> 41:49.948
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.719
Do you want to be cured?

41:54.720 --> 41:58.350
Oh, you mean, do I want to be normal?

41:59.420 --> 42:01.639
Nobody's gonna cure me, honey.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.949
I'm a lost cause.

42:05.760 --> 42:09.742
I'm starting to think that maybe being
normal may not be a bad option.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.599
Does that mean I'm losing my soul?

42:13.700 --> 42:15.799
You know what they say?

42:15.800 --> 42:17.879
<i>If you're losing your
soul and you know it</i>

42:17.880 --> 42:21.639
<i>Then you still got
soul to lose.</i> Whee!

42:21.640 --> 42:24.959
- Bukowski.
- Hmm?

42:24.960 --> 42:26.639
Bukowski said that.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.599
Hey, don't you look at me like that.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.519
Don't...

43:06.520 --> 43:07.839
- The dog knows.
- The dog knows.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.839
- He won't tell.
- We can't be sure.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.239
- He won't tell.
- He just...

43:11.240 --> 43:14.239
- We can't be sure.
- Fuck that mutt.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.439
- Make him sing for his supper.
- Make him sing for his supper.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.559
- Freeloading bastard.
- Chill, chill, chill.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.999
He's nothing to you.
Fuck he's nothing to you.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.519
- Plug him in. See what happens.
- Put him on the machine.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.119
- Plug him in.
- Do it. See what happens.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.759
Push the button and kill us all.

43:29.760 --> 43:32.039
- Hook the dog up.
- Do it.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.239
- Burn the dog.
- Hook the dog up.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.519
- Burn the dog.
- Put him on the machine.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.510
- Push the button.
- Burn the dog.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.719
No, that's what I'm saying.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.599
I didn't find out until
I read the damn paper.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.946
Well, I-l still don't know
which patient got out.

43:55.480 --> 43:57.519
Call me when you have the details.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.159
I'm at Juniper.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.779
I hate home visits.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.199
Who is it?

44:31.200 --> 44:35.279
Suki, it's Dr. Sinclair.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.319
Fuck.

44:37.320 --> 44:41.586
Uh... Uh, give me a minute.

45:05.640 --> 45:07.439
I thought you weren't
coming till Friday.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.959
In light of the suicide
rate around here...

45:09.960 --> 45:12.759
I thought I'd check on you sooner.
What happened to your face?

45:12.760 --> 45:17.859
Uh, self-inflicted crazy person shit.

45:18.360 --> 45:21.079
I said I was better.
I didn't say I was cured.

45:22.240 --> 45:24.359
Oh, Hogan. Do you remember Hogan?

45:24.360 --> 45:26.679
He lives right over there.

45:26.680 --> 45:30.159
Not easily forgotten, Hogan.

45:30.160 --> 45:34.159
- Are you going to invite me inside?
- Uh... Uh...

45:34.160 --> 45:35.991
No?

45:43.640 --> 45:46.079
I see you've, uh, redecorated.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.839
Do you like it?

45:47.840 --> 45:50.679
- I'm hoping it'll catch on.
- You are still on the machine, aren't you?

45:50.680 --> 45:53.039
You know you can't afford
to miss a session.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.319
Relax, Doc. I am
following by the book.

45:56.320 --> 46:00.679
- And the voices?
- Getting quieter every day.

46:00.680 --> 46:04.359
The Scribbler is still very active.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.999
Yes, but that one
can't talk, remember?

46:07.000 --> 46:10.709
"Unzip your head."

46:17.400 --> 46:19.471
What's that?

46:20.160 --> 46:22.719
Uh, the pipes. Bad plumbing.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.599
You should seriously
have it checked out.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.639
This place leaks like
a 10-year-old condom.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.319
And don't get me started
on the electric.

46:28.320 --> 46:32.199
- I mean, these lights...
- It's better than a padded cell, Suki.

46:32.200 --> 46:36.989
- I have to check the counter on the module.
- It's at six.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.224
I'll check it anyway.

46:42.720 --> 46:45.039
Uh-oh, busted.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.719
Back to the funny farm.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.759
You'll have to knock him out.
Or seduce him.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.039
- Take all your clothes off.
- Knock him out.

46:52.040 --> 46:56.386
- Knock him out.
- Knock him out.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.559
- Hello?
- 99's the missing patient.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.159
What? How did she get out?

47:07.160 --> 47:08.879
Her window was smashed.

47:08.880 --> 47:12.079
- Why wasn't I called about this right away?
- I'm sorry, sir.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.639
- I didn't want to bother you.
- You're sure it's Patient 99?

47:14.640 --> 47:17.239
- Yes, sir.
- Pull all the files.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.981
I'll be back right away.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.919
Who's patient number 99?

47:24.920 --> 47:27.279
Is it me?

47:27.280 --> 47:30.319
No. No. I have to cut this short.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.919
And good-bye.

47:31.920 --> 47:35.119
Oh, well, it was lovely
seeing you, Dr. Sinclair.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.622
Thank you so much for coming.
Get home safe.

47:43.080 --> 47:46.439
What are you doing?
Exit only. Exit only.

48:02.560 --> 48:06.223
- Stay behind me.
- Stay in front of me.

48:08.600 --> 48:11.148
Shh.

48:12.560 --> 48:15.461
Give it. Give it.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.199
No. That thing was
like a fucking wolf.

48:36.200 --> 48:40.159
He went primal. I mean, his teeth...
His teeth were like this big.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.039
Look at the door.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.319
Who am I talking to right now?

48:44.320 --> 48:46.039
It's me.

48:46.040 --> 48:49.679
'Cause I know one of your
personalities is a compulsive liar.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.944
You don't believe me?

48:55.920 --> 48:58.024
You believe that?

49:01.240 --> 49:03.344
Fuck me.

49:04.520 --> 49:08.388
Hey, that's my amp and my clock.

49:10.080 --> 49:13.039
This is all shit from my apartment.
When'd you steal all my shit?

49:13.040 --> 49:15.224
I didn't.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.639
- And if I did, it wasn't me.
- Oh!

49:19.640 --> 49:22.279
Uh, you mind? You mind if I just...

49:22.280 --> 49:24.942
Knock yourself out.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.959
These circuits...
They're all messed up.

49:29.960 --> 49:34.119
Nothing makes sense.
It's all back to front.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.319
- Has it done that before?
- No.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.709
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.759
- Let's test it out.
- You're not touching that dog.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.639
No, on me, stupid.
Come on. Hook me up.

49:57.640 --> 50:00.159
This isn't like nicking my medication
when I'm not looking, Hogan.

50:00.160 --> 50:01.919
That thing could kill you.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.319
All right, I'll do it myself.
Where do these go? Here?

50:04.320 --> 50:07.664
- Yeah?
- Stop fucking around.

50:09.840 --> 50:13.039
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- No, no, no. It's not safe.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.319
Hogan, you don't understand.

50:15.320 --> 50:18.983
- You look all right.
- I'm not.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.465
Something's happening to me.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.141
There's something in the scribbles.

50:34.440 --> 50:37.102
Don't be a dick.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.319
Machine, machine, machine, machine.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.639
Suki!

51:01.760 --> 51:04.639
I've never felt anything like it.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.159
I feel so pure.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.150
How do I look?

51:09.800 --> 51:12.079
Dionysian.

51:12.080 --> 51:13.991
Look at me.

51:14.600 --> 51:15.999
I'm glowing.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.079
I'm glowing.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.344
Good for you.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.559
Don't be frightened. I know
what's happening to you now.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.519
I can see it.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.159
- See what?
- About you.

51:33.160 --> 51:36.425
The writing's on the wall.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.759
You plug yourself in,
you let her out.

51:42.760 --> 51:46.759
She gets out,
she modifies the machine.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.479
She's turning it into
something... better.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.679
Something wonderful.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.989
What... What are you doing?

51:57.400 --> 52:00.279
Everything that's in my brain
is firing to its full potential.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.959
This is the real me.

52:01.960 --> 52:04.701
I want to meet the real you.

52:05.440 --> 52:07.359
I am the real me.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.759
Are you?

52:08.760 --> 52:10.719
- Do it.
- Push the button.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.479
It's too crowded. It's too crowded.

52:12.480 --> 52:15.039
- Push the button.
- Push the button.

52:15.040 --> 52:18.199
- It's too crowded.
- Push the button.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.719
Burn us all. Burn us all.

52:20.720 --> 52:23.379
There's yin and yang
in all of us, Suki.

52:23.880 --> 52:26.907
And your yang is
screaming to get out.

52:27.880 --> 52:30.399
- Burn the fucking house down.
- Push the button.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.439
Burn the fucking house down.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.479
Burn the house down.
Burn the house down.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.319
You're right. There is a
screaming yang inside of me.

52:39.320 --> 52:43.711
I don't think natural yoga's
gonna cure it up this time.

52:47.120 --> 52:49.224
Punch it.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.583
Suki?

53:28.800 --> 53:30.904
Your hair.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.479
Come on already.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.399
- Detective.
- What?

53:41.400 --> 53:43.559
It's clearly past her
medication time.

53:43.560 --> 53:46.159
Listen, just because
you're a basket case...

53:46.160 --> 53:49.159
doesn't mean you're not heading
for a cell without the soft padding.

53:49.160 --> 53:51.639
The cute face, sad-eye
routine might work on her...

53:51.640 --> 53:53.999
You think I'm cute?

53:54.000 --> 53:56.502
Would you excuse us for a minute?

54:05.920 --> 54:07.359
You're undermining my process.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.239
I was gonna say the
same thing to you.

54:09.240 --> 54:11.919
This is police work, Silk.
It's not group therapy.

54:11.920 --> 54:14.519
Don't fuck with me, Moss.
You're not smart enough.

54:14.520 --> 54:17.159
I'll get more out of her in half an
hour than you'll get all night...

54:17.160 --> 54:20.159
with your bullshit cop attitude,
so why don't you back the fuck off?

54:20.160 --> 54:22.679
You need to listen to
what she's saying.

54:22.680 --> 54:25.039
- She's just messing with us.
- I don't think so.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.999
You can't possibly believe
any of that horseshit.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.039
The point is, she does.

54:29.040 --> 54:32.079
Her whole story is a delusional
version of the truth.

54:32.080 --> 54:35.359
We'll only find out what really
happened if we read between the lines.

54:35.360 --> 54:38.999
- She's wasting our time.
- She's talking in metaphors.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.879
We need to figure out what they mean.

54:41.880 --> 54:45.031
You know what a metaphor is, right?

54:51.960 --> 54:54.879
So...

54:54.880 --> 54:59.439
after you metaphorically flew out
the window, what happened next?

54:59.440 --> 55:02.399
Metaphorically?

55:02.400 --> 55:05.039
- I don't remember.
- Another blackout?

55:05.040 --> 55:06.519
Why did you do it?

55:06.520 --> 55:10.229
After what happened to
Hogan, why take the risk?

55:12.560 --> 55:16.985
Sometimes your right hand doesn't
know what your left hand is doing.

57:04.200 --> 57:06.509
Hogan.

57:09.440 --> 57:12.022
Bit late for Halloween, isn't it?

57:15.000 --> 57:17.343
What happened?

57:40.080 --> 57:41.866
Cleo.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.582
It happened last night.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.382
Cops were here.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.262
Wanted to talk to you.

57:54.880 --> 57:56.879
What am I gonna tell them?

57:56.880 --> 57:59.667
I don't know where I've been.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.744
I do.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.639
Oh, my God.

58:19.640 --> 58:21.799
I watched you build it.

58:21.800 --> 58:24.799
I mean, I watched
the Scribbler build it.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.428
She's beautiful.

58:37.560 --> 58:38.839
What is it?

58:38.840 --> 58:41.639
Don't you know yet?
You saw what it did to me.

58:41.640 --> 58:44.599
- I don't know what I saw.
- You saw me, Suki.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.439
You saw the real me.

58:46.440 --> 58:50.519
Without the disguise, without the
therapy, without the sedatives.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.439
I was glowing.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.319
- We both were.
- That wasn't me.

58:54.320 --> 58:56.199
Do you still think
this is the real you?

58:56.200 --> 59:00.279
This is just a mask you wear,
this person that you call Suki.

59:00.280 --> 59:03.119
- Don't say it.
- She's just another alter.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.622
Shut up!

59:12.480 --> 59:15.319
She created you to deal with
the shrinks and the suits...

59:15.320 --> 59:16.559
and all their bureaucratic bullshit.

59:16.560 --> 59:18.239
You don't know what
you're talking about.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.879
Suki is just a puppet
imitating human behavior.

59:20.880 --> 59:24.959
- I know who I am, Hogan.
- No. No, you don't. None of us do.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.639
Everyone in the world is suffering
from multiple personalities.

59:27.640 --> 59:29.679
No one knows what their real
face looks like anymore.

59:29.680 --> 59:31.559
- It's all fake.
- I have to get out of here.

59:31.560 --> 59:34.879
No. And go where?
Out there with the mundanes?

59:34.880 --> 59:37.508
They're all fakes, Suki.
They're all photocopies.

59:39.520 --> 59:42.879
Sinclair tried to make you one of
them by killing the best part of you.

59:42.880 --> 59:46.999
But he started something his machine
can't stop 'cause it works for us now.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.519
The Scribbler rewrote the rule
book, and she wrote it backwards.

59:49.520 --> 59:51.749
Because she's insane!

59:56.920 --> 59:59.422
You don't know what she's been doing.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.999
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.679
She's giving you a chance to find
your true nature and be reborn.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.519
Look. Look. It's right there.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.879
Just one more burn, Suki,
and you'll be free forever.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.199
If you're right, one more
burn and I'm gonna be dead.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.439
One of those numbers is me, Hogan.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.944
- Why are you so scared of her?
- Why aren't you?

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.706
- Oh, fuck!
- Suki, no.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.599
- No, no, no.
- Don't be scared.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.559
Hogan, please, please. No, don't.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.879
- Stay away from me!
- Don't be scared!

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.599
Hogan, please. Please,
you're the only friend that I have.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.439
And that's why I have to help you.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.829
No.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.231
Get the fuck away from me!

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.748
Have you seen my dog?

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.719
Hmm.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.439
Hello?

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.719
All my lives, Sinclair,
which one of them's really me?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.759
If you are referring
to your alters...

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.319
than you know very well that
they're extensions of yourself.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.199
Hogan's trying to kill me,
but I don't know...

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.543
if it's really me.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.999
I can't trust anyone.
I can't trust myself.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.799
Everything is back to front.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.599
Nothing is back to front.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.759
That is the Scribbler's
influence. You know it.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.479
We've talked about it many times.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.664
Cleo's dead.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.147
I think the Scribbler killed her.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.239
You have to lock me up, Sinclair.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.519
I'm sick... and delusional.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.479
That machine's done something
to me. I'm seeing things.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.505
What sort of things?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.581
Monsters.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.759
- Where are you, Suki?
- I don't know.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.319
- I'm in a phone booth near the tower.
- Stay there.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.504
I'm coming to find you.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.359
Where is she from?

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.679
Homes, foster care, the street.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.319
She's been through the
system both ways.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.839
We don't have much
information on her.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.079
We know that she didn't
speak until she was 11.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.079
Up until then,
she communicated by writing.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.879
- But as you can see...
- She writes backward.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.199
We think that an early
childhood trauma...

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.079
led to her disassociative problems.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.039
The instability of the child care
system would have been fuel to fire.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.879
She probably adopted an identity
for each new situation.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.719
Eventually she fell through one
of the cracks and ended up here.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.879
- And when was that?
- Four years ago.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.959
And nobody's come looking for her?

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.479
Nobody wants her.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.919
Some of her identities
can be a bit wild.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.479
Is this IQ score a typo?
It's higher than mine.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.039
I know. She's not stupid,
but she is an extreme case...

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.319
disassociative with
borderline schizophrenia.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.959
It took us six months to get her
to sit still and take the test.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.679
She seems pretty calm in there.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.399
She's currently
under the influence...

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.399
of an identity she
calls the Scribbler.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.479
A manifestation like this
is a rare occurrence.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.599
The Scribbler doesn't come
out to play very often.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.919
- And she has no friends?
- No. No family, no home.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.999
And as you can see, no real identity.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.639
She's a bona fide lost soul.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.519
She's the perfect candidate.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.466
That's what you said
about Patient 99.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.079
Have her transferred
to my wing immediately.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.279
Go in there. Get her on film.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.959
Can she hear what's
going on out there?

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.225
No. The walls are soundproof.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.790
Suki?

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.149
Can I talk to Suki?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.860
Do you live inside her?

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.839
Nice outfit.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.399
Trying out a new look.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.187
Come on. I'll take you home.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.039
I'm not going back to the tower.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.702
You don't have anywhere else to go.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.919
- Who's Veronica Orr?
- That is a confidential file, Suki.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.399
This is patient number 99.
I heard you on the phone.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.399
- You lost her.
- I didn't lose her. Give me the file.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.979
What, she was on the machine too?

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:21.079
It was a different kind
of machine. It didn't work.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.199
- Give me the file.
- It made her worse!

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.702
I tried to help her!

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.988
She was an incurable.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.079
Shit.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.959
Jesus Christ.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.919
What did you do to her?

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.119
- It's complicated.
- So am I . Try me.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.719
She... She was a paranoid
schizophrenic...

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.919
with a homicidal jealous mania...

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.039
and she killed everyone her
boyfriend ever slept with...

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.759
and then she killed her boyfriend.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.599
Why are you so interested?

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.759
- Because I know her.
- You know her?

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:58.231
She's here. Patient number
99 is right under your nose.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.341
Only we all call her Alice.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.599
Suki, wait. This isn't Alice.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.479
Yeah, because the real Alice is
probably buried under her floorboards.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.879
What are you talking about?

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.679
Hogan slept with half the women
in this building, Sinclair.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.799
He said everyone he gets
close to commits suicide.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.110
Every henhouse needs a rooster.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.239
We had a brief encounter.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.839
When did she get loose?

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.319
You're sure it's patient 99?

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.159
Who's patient number 99?

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.639
I should've warned you about Alice.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.983
Kind of the jealous type.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.359
My doggy's name is Hogan.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.359
She was trying to warn me.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.862
- Who was warning you?
- The Scribbler.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.239
There hasn't been any
suicides here, Sinclair.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.479
It's just Alice doing what
she does best... pushing.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.399
- Wait here while I call the police.
- I'm gonna go get Hogan.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.509
Sinclair, don't you
like this look for me?

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.828
Alice!

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.319
Emergency.
Which service do you require?

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.439
Hello? Emergency here.

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:44.959
Which service do you require?

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.622
Better send them all.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.229
Hogan!

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.103
Hogan?

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.839
You put Alice on the machine?

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.198
I was trying to help her.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.959
I thought if she saw a
better side of herself...

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.439
I've seen that better side,
Hogan, and it isn't pretty.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.519
She was bouncing around
the room like a pinball.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.599
I didn't know she was so
messed up in her head.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.319
- There's something terrible in there.
- And now it's out here.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.199
I thought she was gonna kill me.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.519
She is.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.639
The only reason you're not dead
yet is because I'm still alive.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.719
- What?
- She's following a pattern.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.479
Everyone you've slept with, Hogan...

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.879
Emily, Cleo...
those girls didn't jump.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.719
They were pushed.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.919
Oh, my God.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.639
This is my fault?

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.679
- And she's coming back for you.
- No, no.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.079
I can't, I can't. Just go.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.399
- Let's go.
- Just... You gotta get out of here.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.359
If she comes back,
I'll try to hold her off.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.148
- You're not gonna be able to stop her.
- Neither will you.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.787
Maybe not me.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.799
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.199
Forget what I said before.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.559
That machine's dangerous.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.999
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.309
Fuck the Scribbler.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.039
That's not you.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.239
Go be whoever you want to be.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.869
No, you're right. I am her.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.279
I just hope that she's me.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.839
- No, it'll kill you!
- When you're crazy...

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.879
you sometimes have to let your
hands make decisions for you.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.999
You watch them writing on walls...

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.707
defacing road signs.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.239
You watch them like they
belong to someone else.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.239
And the way you deal with
this is you learn to enjoy...

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.239
being the freak that
everybody expects you to be.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.879
You watch your hands
writing backwards.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.382
You learn to read in reverse.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.426
You learn to think
from the bottom up.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.585
Suki. Suki, please don't go.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.107
Good-bye, Hogan.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.625
This must be an important part.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.359
The machine belongs to me now.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.749
You can't have it.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.359
No. Alice!

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.199
First the hens, then the rooster.
I'm coming back for you, boy.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.102
I did this to you.
It's my fault. Leave her alone.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.759
God made me this way, Hogan.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.627
I'm sure he knew what he was doing.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.239
They say you find out who you
really are on the way down.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.479
But I've already seen it.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.559
The Scribbler's machine
shows you everything.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.399
It wakes up parts of the
brain that we never use.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.399
Side effects include telekinesis,
super strength and cool hair.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.639
They also include bad Alice.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.639
The machine shows you
who you are on the inside...

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.479
for better or worse.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.359
Hogan is a child,
innocent and unspoiled.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.421
Alice is stained black by
jealousy and resentment.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.390
And me?

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.359
When they ask why you jumped...

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.279
I'm gonna tell 'em it's because you
couldn't live with erectile dysfunction.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.147
Think about that on the way down.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.189
Suki?

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.439
Look at us. We're all inside out.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.639
Why won't you fight back?

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.519
Fight back.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.342
Fight back!

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.399
Had enough of the freak show already?

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.189
Help me?
You can't even help yourself.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.421
Oh, shit.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.551
Oh, God.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.399
Is that me?

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.551
Is that what I am?

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.279
Why wasn't I like you?

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.147
Why wasn't I beautiful on the inside?

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.639
Don't touch me.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.759
Don't get near me.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.467
I know what I'll do
if you get too close.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.742
I know who I am now.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.228
I am the pusher.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.239
Suki.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.599
Oh, I thought you were gone for good.

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.559
I'm still here.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.359
And the Scribbler?

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.879
We're both here.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.479
At the same time?

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.470
Yeah.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.839
I guess she never
wanted to take over.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.344
- She just wanted...
- Symbiosis.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.119
She needs me.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.224
Because you can talk.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.226
Because I can deal with the bullshit.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.959
Hey, I found this.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.399
I can fix the machine.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.062
Doesn't matter.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.102
We don't need it anymore.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.599
Delta 1566.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.679
Give me a call on your primary...

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:17.039
- Mr. Hogan?
- Where's Suki?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.279
She's upstairs making her statement.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.307
And don't think about going
anywhere 'cause you're next.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.990
Oh.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.830
Why are you taking my water?

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.950
Do you want to tell me
what I saw here tonight?

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.906
Suki wanted me to give you this.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:05.319
"Your world is back
to front, not mine."

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.346
We've been telling
you that for years.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.591
Yeah, I know.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.749
Come on, fella.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.919
So you're saying that Alice...

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.359
- Veronica.
- Right, Veronica.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.228
Are you saying she threw
herself off the roof?

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.239
- Her last push.
- Is that a metaphor for something?

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.027
I don't think so.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.590
Stay here.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.639
Suki.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:04.142
Where is she?

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.439
You're never going to understand...

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.879
any of this logically,
Detective Moss, so don't try.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.879
Your laws and rules,
they don't apply here.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:32.719
There are no black-and-white
answers for you.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.999
Just gray areas.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.159
Just human psychology.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.788
Jennifer will understand.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.079
They tell us madness
is culturally relative.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.390
I say it's culturally relevant.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.439
When you're crazy...

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.679
your right hand doesn't always
know what your left hand is doing.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.679
You deal with this by learning to
appreciate the importance of symmetry...

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:07.599
left brain, right brain,
yin and yang.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.263
It doesn't matter whether you're
coming up heads or tails...

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:15.879
you still need both
sides of the coin.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.305
You have to understand that before you
can ever hope to understand yourself.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.902
I see a world of people who
aren't who they think they are...

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.861
waiting for someone to wake them up.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.710
Waiting to shine.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.079
<i>You're never gonna get us</i>

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:52.580
<i>You're never gonna get us</i>

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:20.622
<i>We've already seen
you from miles away</i>

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:29.101
<i>You knock on the door
with your smile on display</i>

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:36.783
<i>We already know what
you're going to say</i>

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.239
<i>Yeah</i>

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:45.740
<i>You're never gonna get us</i>

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.342
<i>No</i>

01:29:08.305 --> 01:29:14.373
