-What are you talking about?
-All the tools and stuff.

01:04:58.984 --> 01:05:02.278
Well, it may come as a surprise
to a thief...

01:05:02.446 --> 01:05:05.657
...but I bought this stuff, everything in here,
with my own money.

01:05:05.824 --> 01:05:07.825
Yeah, yeah. That's not what I meant.

01:05:07.993 --> 01:05:10.286
I mean, there's just so much shit
packed in here.

01:05:10.454 --> 01:05:14.415
Yeah. Well, every tool in here
has a purpose.

01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:16.501
Everything has a job to do.

01:05:16.669 --> 01:05:19.045
They're all to use if necessary.

01:05:19.213 --> 01:05:21.464
Okay, so, what's that?

01:05:21.632 --> 01:05:23.466
-That's a post-hole digger.
-That?

01:05:23.634 --> 01:05:24.717
Vise grips.

01:05:24.885 --> 01:05:26.469
-That?
-Wire cutters.

01:05:26.637 --> 01:05:28.805
You know it's a trowel, come on.

01:05:28.973 --> 01:05:31.140
Those are shears there,
and that's a saw.

01:05:31.308 --> 01:05:33.851
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:38.773
All right, what's on your mind?

01:05:39.817 --> 01:05:43.361
It's just, I can't afford
to buy all this stuff.

01:05:43.904 --> 01:05:47.949
Well, I guess even a bonehead
like you could understand...

01:05:48.117 --> 01:05:51.202
...that a man acquires this
over a period of 50 years.

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:55.498
-Yeah, but....
-All right, look, here.

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:59.627
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.

01:05:59.795 --> 01:06:05.341
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.

01:06:05.509 --> 01:06:09.220
Any man worth his salt
can do half of the household chores...

01:06:09.388 --> 01:06:10.888
...with just those three things.

01:06:11.056 --> 01:06:13.558
Anything else you need,
you just borrow it, that's all.

01:06:13.726 --> 01:06:16.060
Okay. Cool.

01:06:17.313 --> 01:06:19.439
[COUGHING]

01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:27.780
-Fuck me.
-What's with that?

01:06:27.948 --> 01:06:30.074
Nothing. What?

01:06:30.242 --> 01:06:32.744
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.

01:06:32.911 --> 01:06:35.913
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.

01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:39.625
Yeah.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.627
Look...

01:06:42.254 --> 01:06:46.799
...those guys who were here
the other night, on my lawn.

01:06:46.967 --> 01:06:48.051
What about them?

01:06:48.218 --> 01:06:50.303
Just a gang, a bunch
of Hmong gangbangers.

01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:53.389
Yeah, I assumed that,
but what were they doing here?

01:06:53.557 --> 01:06:55.308
They were gonna take me away.

01:06:55.476 --> 01:06:59.562
They were kind of pissed
that I blew my first initiation.

01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:05.818
Yeah. Well, you are a pussy, you know,
you wanna hang out with guys like that.

01:07:05.986 --> 01:07:07.862
What was your initiation supposed to be?

01:07:18.082 --> 01:07:19.791
My Gran Torino?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.380
Christ all Friday.

01:07:43.482 --> 01:07:45.024
Shit.

01:07:48.946 --> 01:07:50.530
Toad, you got a minute?

01:07:51.657 --> 01:07:54.200
All right. Okay.

01:07:54.368 --> 01:07:55.785
Here it is.

01:07:55.953 --> 01:07:59.247
Here's the deal. I take the top
because that's the heaviest.

01:07:59.415 --> 01:08:01.624
I pull on that,
and you stand right back here...

01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:04.419
...and you push
and help me push it up each step.

01:08:04.586 --> 01:08:06.546
-Just like that.
-Then let me take the top.

01:08:06.713 --> 01:08:08.005
No, no, I've got the top.

01:08:08.173 --> 01:08:10.091
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.

01:08:10.259 --> 01:08:12.844
Look, I'm not crippled. I've got the top.

01:08:13.011 --> 01:08:15.596
If you don't let me take the top,
I ain't helping.

01:08:15.764 --> 01:08:18.433
-Now, listen to me, zipperhead--
-No, you listen, old man.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.437
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.

01:08:22.604 --> 01:08:24.689
[GROWLS]

01:08:26.191 --> 01:08:31.279
All right. You take the top, and I'll push.

01:08:31.447 --> 01:08:36.451
Just don't let it slip out of your
little-girl hands and crush me.

01:08:37.536 --> 01:08:38.870
Don't give me any ideas, now.

01:08:49.089 --> 01:08:51.466
-That thing weighs a ton.
-Yeah.

01:08:52.134 --> 01:08:56.220
It runs like a clock, though. They just
don't make them like this anymore.

01:08:56.388 --> 01:08:58.973
So, what are you gonna do with it?

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.392
Sell it, I guess.

01:09:02.728 --> 01:09:03.935
How much?

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:07.564
60 bucks. They....

01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:11.109
I'm tired of having it sit around
down in the basement there.

01:09:11.278 --> 01:09:14.613
Why? You looking for a freezer?

01:09:14.781 --> 01:09:16.908
The downstairs one kind of died.

01:09:17.075 --> 01:09:19.952
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.455
Twenty-five? But you just said 60.

01:09:22.622 --> 01:09:25.582
I know, but this'll save me money
putting an ad in the paper.

01:09:25.751 --> 01:09:29.045
-Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
-All right. Okay.

01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:37.220
-Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT: What?

01:09:37.386 --> 01:09:40.348
Toad washing the car
that he tried to steal from you.

01:09:40.515 --> 01:09:44.727
Yeah. He misses one spot,
he's doing it all over again too.

01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:46.938
It's nice of you to
look after him like this.

01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:49.398
He doesn't have any real role models
in his life.

01:09:49.566 --> 01:09:51.067
Well, I'm not any role model.

01:09:51.234 --> 01:09:52.944
But you're a good man, Wally.

01:09:53.111 --> 01:09:55.238
I wish our father
would've been more like you.

01:09:55.405 --> 01:09:58.074
-Don't go calling me Wally.
-No, I'm serious.

01:09:58.242 --> 01:10:02.161
He was really hard on us, really traditional,
and really old-school.

01:10:02.329 --> 01:10:06.958
-Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
-Yeah, but you're an American.

01:10:08.085 --> 01:10:09.919
What's that supposed to mean?

01:10:13.757 --> 01:10:15.091
You like him, don't you?

01:10:15.259 --> 01:10:17.885
Are you kidding? He tried to steal my car.

01:10:18.053 --> 01:10:20.054
Uh-huh. And you spend time with him...

01:10:20.222 --> 01:10:23.683
...teach him how to fix things,
saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.

01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:27.478
-Hey. Watch your language, lady.
-And you're a good man.

01:10:28.313 --> 01:10:30.439
I'm not a good man.

01:10:30.607 --> 01:10:33.943
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.

01:10:40.701 --> 01:10:44.912
You know, the Hmong consider gardening
to be women's work.

01:10:45.289 --> 01:10:49.417
Yeah. That's probably why I see you
in the garden over there all the time.

01:10:49.585 --> 01:10:52.086
Besides, we ain't in Humong.

01:10:52.254 --> 01:10:54.005
Funny.

01:10:56.174 --> 01:10:59.969
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.

01:11:00.137 --> 01:11:04.181
Yeah? So is being in a gang, dipshit.

01:11:04.349 --> 01:11:07.518
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.

01:11:09.104 --> 01:11:11.022
You should quit.

01:11:12.024 --> 01:11:14.358
So, what's that emblem supposed
to mean anyway?

01:11:14.526 --> 01:11:17.320
Your ancient camp scout emblem?

01:11:18.196 --> 01:11:21.282
First Cavalry. I've had it since '51.

01:11:24.036 --> 01:11:26.287
So, what do you want to do
with your life, kid?

01:11:26.622 --> 01:11:30.374
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.

01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:32.209
Sales, huh?

01:11:33.337 --> 01:11:35.713
My oldest son is in sales.

01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:40.426
-Does he do well?
-Oh, yeah. License to steal.

01:11:40.594 --> 01:11:45.473
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years,
and he's out selling Japanese cars.

01:11:45.641 --> 01:11:48.100
-You made cars?
-Yeah.

01:11:48.977 --> 01:11:52.021
I put the steering column
in this Gran Torino...

01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:55.983
...in 1972, right on the line.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.487
Oh, you are old. So cool.

01:11:59.655 --> 01:12:05.201
Yeah. So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?

01:12:05.369 --> 01:12:10.122
-Kind of, but school costs money.
-Well, maybe you should get a job.

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:14.460
You can't just sit there and spread mulch
in my garden the rest of your life.

01:12:14.628 --> 01:12:19.256
-Well, maybe you could just pay me.
-Yeah. Very funny.

01:12:20.509 --> 01:12:22.426
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?

01:12:22.594 --> 01:12:25.930
Yeah. You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.349
Yeah, I know.

01:12:28.517 --> 01:12:32.144
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.

01:12:32.312 --> 01:12:35.064
-You could get a job anywhere.
-Like what?

01:12:35.232 --> 01:12:37.858
-Well, how about construction?
-Me?

01:12:38.026 --> 01:12:39.402
-Yeah.
-Construction?

01:12:39.569 --> 01:12:43.614
-You have Alzheimer's or something?
-No. You could get a job in construction.

01:12:43.782 --> 01:12:46.117
I know people in the trades.

01:12:46.284 --> 01:12:49.578
Course, I have to make a little adjustment
and man you up a little bit.

01:12:50.038 --> 01:12:52.707
-Man me up?
-Yeah.

01:12:52.874 --> 01:12:56.293
And I think you ought to
date Miss Yum Yum too.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.463
Do you a little good.

01:13:00.257 --> 01:13:03.467
You know, get a little carbon
off the valves.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.641
Now you're just gonna learn
how guys talk.

01:13:10.809 --> 01:13:14.645
You just listen to the way Martin
and I batter it back and forth.

01:13:14.813 --> 01:13:16.897
-You okay? You ready?
-Sure.

01:13:17.065 --> 01:13:19.275
WALT:
All right. Let's go in.

01:13:21.403 --> 01:13:22.570
Perfect.

01:13:23.321 --> 01:13:25.114
A Polack and a chink.

01:13:26.032 --> 01:13:28.534
How you doing, Martin,
you crazy Italian prick?

01:13:28.702 --> 01:13:32.663
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd
come in. I was having such a pleasant day.

01:13:32.831 --> 01:13:35.666
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy
out of his money?

01:13:35.834 --> 01:13:38.586
-Gave him the wrong change?
-Who's the Nip?

01:13:38.754 --> 01:13:43.424
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.

01:13:43.592 --> 01:13:45.217
Mm.

01:13:45.385 --> 01:13:48.888
You see, kid? Now, that's how guys
talk to one another.

01:13:49.055 --> 01:13:51.390
-They do?
-What, you got shit in your ears?

01:13:51.558 --> 01:13:55.603
Now go on out and come back in,
and talk to him like a man.

01:13:55.771 --> 01:13:56.937
Like a real man.

01:13:57.105 --> 01:14:00.524
-Come on, Walt.
-Come on. Get your ass out of here.

01:14:00.692 --> 01:14:02.610
And come on back now.

01:14:02.778 --> 01:14:05.571
-Sorry about this.
-It's okay.

01:14:10.577 --> 01:14:12.453
What's up, you old Italian prick?

01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:15.372
Get out of my shop before
I blow your head off...

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:19.835
-...you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
-Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.

01:14:20.337 --> 01:14:21.712
Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.799
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

01:14:24.966 --> 01:14:27.885
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.

01:14:28.053 --> 01:14:30.554
You don't just come in
and insult the man in his shop.

01:14:30.722 --> 01:14:34.517
You don't do that. What happens if you
meet some stranger and get the wrong one?

01:14:34.684 --> 01:14:38.270
-He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
-What should I have said, then?

01:14:38.438 --> 01:14:42.149
Yeah, kid, why don't you start
with "Hi" or "Hello"?

01:14:42.317 --> 01:14:43.567
Yeah, just come in and say:

01:14:43.735 --> 01:14:45.736
"Sir, I'd like a haircut,
if you have time."

01:14:45.904 --> 01:14:47.905
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.

01:14:48.073 --> 01:14:51.033
WALT: You could talk about
a construction job you just came from...

01:14:51.201 --> 01:14:54.161
...and bitch about your girlfriend
and your car.

01:14:54.329 --> 01:14:58.415
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed,
and those sons of bitches really nailed me.

01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:01.669
-I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
WALT: Don't swear at the guy.

01:15:01.837 --> 01:15:04.547
Just talk about people
who are not in the room.

01:15:04.714 --> 01:15:08.467
You could bitch about your boss making you
work overtime when it's bowling night.

01:15:08.635 --> 01:15:11.971
Right. Or my old lady bitches
for two goddamn hours...

01:15:12.138 --> 01:15:15.599
...about how they don't take
expired coupons at the grocery store...

01:15:15.767 --> 01:15:20.145
...and the minute I turn on the game,
she starts crying how we never talk.

01:15:20.313 --> 01:15:22.898
You see? Now go out, come back
and talk to him.

01:15:23.066 --> 01:15:25.568
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.

01:15:26.069 --> 01:15:30.906
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car
or a girlfriend.

01:15:31.074 --> 01:15:33.826
Jesus. I should've blown his head off
when I had the chance.

01:15:33.994 --> 01:15:35.119
Yeah. Maybe so.

01:15:35.287 --> 01:15:38.664
Now, okay, I want you to turn around
and go outside...

01:15:38.832 --> 01:15:42.126
...and come back, and don't talk
about having no job...

01:15:42.294 --> 01:15:46.505
...no car, no girlfriend,
no future, no dick.

01:15:46.673 --> 01:15:49.550
Okay? Just turn around and go.

01:16:03.982 --> 01:16:07.234
Excuse me, sir. I need a haircut,
if you ain't too busy.

01:16:07.402 --> 01:16:10.321

01:50:02.393 --> 01:50:04.978
Now, which brings us to our last item,
and again...

01:50:05.146 --> 01:50:07.981
...please excuse the language
in Mr. Kowalski's will.

01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:10.943
I'm simply reading it
the way it was written.

01:50:12.362 --> 01:50:17.991
"And I'd like to leave
my 1972 Gran Torino...

01:50:22.538 --> 01:50:24.665
...to my friend...

01:50:25.875 --> 01:50:29.211
...Thao Vang Lor...

01:50:29.379 --> 01:50:33.548
...on the condition that you don't chop-top
the roof like one of those beaners...

01:50:33.716 --> 01:50:38.804
...don't paint any idiotic flames on it
like some white-trash hillbilly...

01:50:38.972 --> 01:50:41.431
...and don't put a big, gay spoiler
on the rear end...

01:50:41.599 --> 01:50:44.309
...like you see
on all the other zipperheads' cars.

01:50:44.477 --> 01:50:45.936
It just looks like hell.

01:50:46.104 --> 01:50:50.816
If you can refrain from doing any of that,
it's yours."

01:50:51.305 --> 01:50:57.502
