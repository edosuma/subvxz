00:11.120 --> 00:13.360
<i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:14.760 --> 00:19.840
<i>My birthright Bebbanburg was cruelly taken</i>
<i>by my Uncle Aelfric.</i>

00:19.920 --> 00:23.680
My greatest fighters...
or the most fearful?

00:23.760 --> 00:25.160
[Uhtred] <i>His men desert him</i>

00:25.240 --> 00:29.000
<i>and the Scots send raiders,</i>
<i>who weaken those that remain.</i>

00:29.680 --> 00:31.240
How many did we lose this time?

00:31.760 --> 00:34.880
[Uhtred] <i>The time is right for me</i>
<i>to take back what is mine.</i>

00:35.320 --> 00:37.200
Give me 100 men. It will take a week.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.480
Two hundred, I can take it in a day.

00:39.560 --> 00:44.480
<i>But the new king, Edward, has fallen</i>
<i>under the influence of Lord Aethelhelm.</i>

00:44.560 --> 00:47.320
I'm no longer the boy
who can be bent to your will!

00:47.400 --> 00:51.320
[Uhtred]<i> Aethelred of Mercia looks</i>
<i>to Bebbanburg for a different purpose.</i>

00:51.400 --> 00:54.960
I'm collecting all the bones
of our beloved saint as a good omen

00:55.040 --> 00:58.160
to signal to the Mercian people that
I shall restore their lands to greatness.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.840
[Uhtred] <i>He has sent holy men there</i>
<i>to bargain for an ancient relic.</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:05.760
<i>I have also sought out the help</i>
<i>of a Christian.</i>

01:06.320 --> 01:07.160
Hello, Father.

01:07.240 --> 01:12.400
<i>My son, who was taken by Alfred</i>
<i>and raised with a devout faith</i>.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.240
<i>The Mercian commander Eardwulf</i>

01:15.320 --> 01:18.600
<i>has traveled to East Anglia</i>
<i>to meet with Haesten.</i>

01:18.680 --> 01:19.920
Did you see them leave?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.760
Yes. They’re dismantling their camp
and packing their boats.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.760
[Uhtred] <i>And now Aethelred looks</i>
<i>to conquer Daneland</i>

01:26.840 --> 01:28.720
<i>as well as Eardwulf’s sister.</i>

01:30.400 --> 01:34.200
<i>The feelings that Aethelflaed and I</i>
<i>have always held</i>

01:34.280 --> 01:35.840
<i>can no longer be contained.</i>

01:36.600 --> 01:40.520
<i>But for now, my duty draws me</i>
<i>to the north once again.</i>

01:41.160 --> 01:42.760
To Bebbanburg!

01:43.480 --> 01:45.240
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:46.560 --> 01:49.960
[wind howls]

02:07.360 --> 02:08.640
Rán can be a vixen.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.880
This should settle her.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.880
Rán is pagan lies.
I pity you for believing it.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.080
-Finan, give him something to do.
-[Finan] Yes, Lord!

02:20.320 --> 02:23.080
[groans] Oh, God. Whoa.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.880
Hey! You can empty this.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.000
[men laughing]

02:31.280 --> 02:32.200
[laughs]

02:33.040 --> 02:34.200
Tell me the truth.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.640
-Am I the bait?
-For what?

02:38.320 --> 02:40.080
In the plan you are hiding from me.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.640
-Am I the bait?
-Nothing is hidden from you.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.280
We are tracking monks
who have entry to Bebbanburg.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.160
You will befriend them, enter Bebbanburg
and open the sea gate to us.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.760
I think you have another reason
for dragging me into your revenge.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.560
Yes, so you may win honor and reputation.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.640
The only reputation that matters
is my standing with God.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.240
You cannot force a boy to be a warrior.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.040
My blood runs within his veins.
Why can he not see that?

03:08.120 --> 03:10.520
Because your blood is that
of a stubborn bastard!

03:13.800 --> 03:15.920
-Our Father--
-Who do you pray for, boy?

03:17.880 --> 03:20.200
-Hm?
-The men you will slaughter.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.040
You seem to take things
when you want them.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.080
When you do, show mercy.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.440
To my Uncle Aelfric,
who spent a lifetime wishing me dead?

03:31.680 --> 03:34.240
-There is a power in forgiveness.
-Good.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.280
Then you may use it to forgive me.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.600
He continues to sign himself
King of Mercia,

03:51.680 --> 03:54.040
and now we hear he leads troops
out of Aegelesburg.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.080
Aethelred has always been ambitious.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.280
-Do you know where he's gone?
-My husband doesn’t inform me of anything.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.800
I know he is seeking the bones
of St. Oswald.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.720
Edward, that is grave.

04:05.800 --> 04:10.560
If he is seeking St. Oswald,
he is seeking to break from Wessex.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.800
Many Mercians believe
that uniting the body of the saint

04:15.880 --> 04:18.120
will restore their land to greatness.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.560
Yes, but the people want peace, not war.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.200
Still, it is a signal of intention.

04:23.279 --> 04:26.360
Or a ploy to pander
to the simple folk of Mercia.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.040
The people of Mercia are not simple.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.080
Well, whatever it is he is doing...

04:33.760 --> 04:35.680
do not allow yourself to be drawn in.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.920
The weak should not be allowed
to set terms.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.560
If you do not play, he cannot win.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.680
Leave childishness to the little children.

04:43.760 --> 04:48.040
Ah. Here he is,
the future King of all the realm.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.320
-[Aelfweard laughs]
-See how nimble he is!

04:51.120 --> 04:52.720
That’s a great swordsman in the making!

04:53.360 --> 04:54.840
Yes, indeed. [clears throat]

04:54.920 --> 04:56.480
-Lady.
-Lord.

04:56.560 --> 05:00.040
Yes, and he is a child
of great authority, too.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.880
You should have seen the way he kicked
Steapa to make his displeasure known.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.080
[Steapa chuckles]

05:05.160 --> 05:06.560
A boy of many talents.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.040
[Edward sighs]

05:10.720 --> 05:11.640
Come with me.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.560
I want to show you a book
of your grandfather's.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.200
Do not pester the boy with Latin.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.000
[Aethelhelm]
He is to be a king, not a clerk.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
The men of Wessex are fighters.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.040
Rule the sword and rule the land.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.640
He digs away at all that is precious.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.320
Yes, it is troubling...

05:36.240 --> 05:38.640
as are my husband's intentions.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.800
I will ask Aldhelm to make inquiries.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.840
Father Pyrlig?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.000
Bring Father Beocca to me.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.440
I was a little unjust with him...

05:54.840 --> 05:57.240
and wish to ask his advice
on a certain person.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.040
Father Beocca has left Winchester, Lady.

06:00.120 --> 06:04.160
He felt there was nothing left here
for him. I doubt he will ever return.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.040
And so our allies abandon us.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.920
Lady, you asked for him to be removed.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.120
Yes.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.480
Yes, I suppose I did.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.280
Just as I asked my son to be married
to that vain, silly girl.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.160
Why the Lord guided me this way,
I cannot fathom.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.000
Maybe the Lord didn't.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.680
Any path I chose was to secure
the country my husband loved.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.880
And how well did that work, Lady?

07:30.640 --> 07:33.280
[villagers murmuring]

07:33.360 --> 07:37.520
A pathetic hoard, most of them drunk
or senile. The Scots will laugh.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.680
I cannot hold them off with this!
We need more warriors.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.400
-I have been trying, Lord.
-[Aelfric scoffs]

07:43.480 --> 07:46.440
The slaver can get us trained men,
but he wants 10,000.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.560
Ten thousand would empty the treasury.
What good is a fortress without silver?

07:50.640 --> 07:53.720
Lord, we must sell the heart
of Saint Oswald.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.800
Time is moving against us.

07:57.480 --> 08:00.640
We can only sustain these attacks
from the Scots for so long.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.320
He's desperate for it, you say, Aethelred?

08:04.760 --> 08:06.320
This is what I have heard.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.760
[Aidan] The monks he dispatched
will arrive here soon.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.360
Then we shall bleed silver from him
and buy the men.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.240
So, where do we start?

08:57.480 --> 09:00.040
Where do you look for monks
in a place like this?

09:00.720 --> 09:02.800
-St. Colman's?
-The whorehouse!

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
[all laughing]

09:05.000 --> 09:07.200
That’s it. I’m staying on the boat.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.480
It’s not safe for you to be alone
this deep within Danelaw.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.360
-Come.
-Then I will pray for salvation.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.240
I will stay with him, keep us both safe.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.880
-They do not love a priest in Grimesby.
-Thank you, Father.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.200
To the whorehouse then!

09:22.920 --> 09:24.800
[Beocca]
You misjudge your father, you know.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.680
He’s not the bloodthirsty heathen
you take him for.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.120
Thou shalt not kill, Father Beocca.

09:30.960 --> 09:34.120
-Or are you rusty on the scripture?
-I know the teaching.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.600
But I also know Aelfric.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.760
And having some years on you,
I also know...

09:40.280 --> 09:43.280
that sometimes
one must do wrong to do right.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.440
Aelfric tried to kill a child
for no gain but wooden walls.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.720
And for that, he wrenched a boy
from his Christian life...

09:54.200 --> 09:57.320
delivered him to the heathens
and damned his soul to all eternity.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.960
Uhtred is avenging a great wrong
done to him.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.800
Help him in his mission
and you will be helping--

10:05.880 --> 10:08.080
Helping him return to a life
of Christian piety?

10:09.640 --> 10:10.560
No.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.280
-Not that, but--
-There is a chance.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.120
All sinners can repent.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.000
Well, we shall see.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.000
Come on.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.120
[door thuds]

10:31.200 --> 10:34.520
[murmuring]

10:34.600 --> 10:36.720
Grimesby seems like a lovely place.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.080
-I hear the oysters are delicious.
-Hm.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.360
[the inn falls silent]

10:46.240 --> 10:49.440
Sihtric, don't make eye contact.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.920
-What’s your business here?
-We’re traders.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.480
We’re taking pelts to Frankia.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.800
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.800
Well, you keep trouble out of my alehouse,
agreed?

10:58.880 --> 11:02.000
Hey, we’re just hungry for some food,
nothing more.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.480
And do you have women? He needs a woman.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.600
We’re not that sort of alehouse.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.320
Finan.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.240
[grunting]

11:14.320 --> 11:15.800
She's yours until nightfall.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.240
If you’re quick, you can both get a turn.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.560
He’ll certainly be quick.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.120
[man grunting, woman groans]

11:23.200 --> 11:25.160
[tavern owner chuckles]

11:26.080 --> 11:29.240
[Osferth] Hey, why do I always have
to pretend to be the virgin?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.680
[Uhtred] Because no one would believe
I am the virgin.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.160
[man groans]

11:33.240 --> 11:35.880
-[whipping]
-[Oswi] Harder, like your sister does it.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.760
-[woman grunts]
-[groaning]

11:37.840 --> 11:39.960
[Brother Oswi] Hit it.

11:40.040 --> 11:43.640
-[woman grunts]
-[groaning]

11:44.040 --> 11:47.040
-Lead me out to the darkness, Lord.
-[woman grunts]

11:47.440 --> 11:48.640
And let this sin...

11:48.720 --> 11:52.960
-I’m a virgin in that, Lord.
-[Uhtred] I’m sure you are, Osferth.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.120
We’ve found our monks.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.920
Oi, watching costs extra.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.440
[Oswi] Harder!

12:10.880 --> 12:14.680
Traveling overnight, all that way
in the saddle with a red raw ass,

12:14.760 --> 12:16.680
a good thing they like pain!

12:16.760 --> 12:19.640
It takes six days to get to Bebbanburg
on the coast road.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.040
[Finan] They’ll get there
before Ascension.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.720
I'm a good Christian boy, Lord.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.960
You should not arrive before them.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.760
The rocks around Bebbanburg
do not treat ships kindly.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.840
So, we wait here and enjoy the atmosphere?

12:34.360 --> 12:37.480
[men murmuring]

12:42.000 --> 12:46.240
Uhtred, see these two monks?
They're the ones we’ve been searching for.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.600
They’re leaving for Bebbanburg.
Follow them.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.000
It's our strongest chance
of getting into the fortress.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.440
-I can’t simply follow--
-If there were, I would not ask.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.320
My men have been there recently.
They would be recognized.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.720
-So, I am the sacrificial lamb--
-You are our greatest hope.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.400
Do not do this for me.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.480
Do it for your descendants.
Whatever I take will one day be yours.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.880
I'm not the warrior
you seem to mistake me for.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.040
Why do you have this faith in me?

13:11.440 --> 13:14.600
Because I know that the spirit
of our family is within you.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.800
[Uhtred] That will give you a strength
that you do not know yet.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.920
I will try and do as you need,
but I will not kill a man.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.080
That is all I want.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.600
Three pieces of silver says he runs home.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.560
-[Uhtred] Take this horse.
-[Beocca] Uhtred.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.360
Ride the road north, close to the shore.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.640
Leave now, so you can be ahead
of the monks.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.400
Find them. Join them.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.320
-[Finan] Lord!
-I would not send you to be slaughtered.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.400
When I see you signal,
I will approach the sea gate.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.160
He'll be looked after.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.600
He's blessed, as are you.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.400
[Finan] All right, come on.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.880
Uhtred.

14:07.960 --> 14:08.840
[men murmuring]

14:39.160 --> 14:40.360
[Aethelred] Try it on.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.360
I will, when you leave.

14:44.440 --> 14:46.560
No. I had it made for you.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.720
I want to see it now.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.400
Lord, I will not undress before you.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.760
-I am a woman from a noble family.
-Whose father disgraced--

14:54.840 --> 14:56.640
Whose father was unfairly shamed
for no reason

14:56.720 --> 14:58.520
other than falling
from the Ealdormen's favor.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.840
Lady, enough of this game.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.520
You have no good reason to deny me.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.120
I act simply for the good of your soul.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.720
You have a wife.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.080
You are right.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.320
I see that now.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.280
I should make myself a widower
and marry you.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.040
Is that not what you want?

15:32.040 --> 15:34.240
Along with all of these silks and furs.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.560
Just... a good life..

15:38.720 --> 15:40.200
for a girl who has nothing.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.800
Am I being very unfair?

15:45.560 --> 15:47.920
Have I misjudged your Christian soul?

15:54.640 --> 15:56.040
It can all be arranged.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.560
-Did you do the deed?
-No.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.000
Drag it out much longer,
he’ll lose interest.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.280
How wrong you are.
He's not losing interest.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.320
He's threatening to have
Lady Aethelflaed killed,

16:35.400 --> 16:36.480
so that he may marry me.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.960
That is good news!

16:38.040 --> 16:41.600
No, it is not! I would have the blood
of Alfred's daughter on my hands.

16:41.680 --> 16:42.920
It seems like a fair exchange.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.960
Married to a man
who kills those who displease him?

16:45.040 --> 16:48.160
-Again, it seems like--
-He is volatile and we must be careful.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.760
Promise me, if he asks you to attack
Lady Aethelflaed, you will refuse.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.080
I will never defy the wishes
of King Aethelred.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.760
And nor should you.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.880
We will rest here
and attack at first light.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.839
Catch the Mercians sleeping in their beds.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.280
How far is Aegelesburg?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.280
-Close enough to surprise them.
-Then this is where I say goodbye.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.319
[Brida]
We camp here tonight, march at dawn!

17:27.400 --> 17:29.680
[Cnut] You are certain
we cannot tempt you to battle?

17:29.760 --> 17:32.920
I have no interest in fighting,
only women and silver.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Because you have to pay women
to hump them?

17:35.280 --> 17:37.200
Better than reeling them in with lies.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.920
Fair. But everything I did allowed
the Danes to triumph.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.760
You will miss
a great gathering of armies, Haesten.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.520
Edward is honor-bound to defend the land
of his sister and mother.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.680
Aethelred's death
will force swift retaliation.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.600
[Cnut] We will ride into Mercia in a fury

17:52.680 --> 17:55.440
and will force them to a battle place
where we have the advantage.

17:55.520 --> 17:59.200
Wessex, Mercians, all Christians.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.480
This will bring them together.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.760
Then you will have united the Saxons.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.640
Alfred would be very proud.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.320
Cnut! Let’s go.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.120
Boys, come here.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.480
I want you to go with our friend Haesten.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.880
He will take you north
until our campaign is over.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.600
Should they not witness the battle?
I know it’s dangerous but--

18:21.680 --> 18:24.640
There will be battles to come.
Today, they are too young.

18:26.080 --> 18:30.600
Haesten, attend to them
and teach them nothing you know.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.280
-[chuckles]
-[Cnut] Come, boys, let’s get you ready.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.160
The shit loves his offspring.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.280
How did he draw you to him?

18:39.360 --> 18:40.840
We made a bond in blood.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.520
If you ever get bored
of the ugly bastard...

18:44.440 --> 18:47.320
you know, I have fathered ten children.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.880
-That is of no use to me.
-[chuckles] No?

18:52.760 --> 18:53.600
No...

18:54.680 --> 18:57.240
because you carry his pup!

19:00.080 --> 19:01.400
[laughs]

19:01.480 --> 19:03.280
I can tell by the tits.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.440
If you tell him this
before I fight the Saxons...

19:10.920 --> 19:13.840
I will cut off your balls
and feed them to you.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.480
I'm overjoyed for you, Brida.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.640
The world needs more little Cnuts.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.640
[Cnut] Brida!

19:19.720 --> 19:20.960
-Hm?
-[Cnut] Come.

19:22.200 --> 19:27.160
[Cnut] Rest tonight. Prepare yourselves.
There will be many sleepless nights ahead!

19:27.240 --> 19:32.080
But, at daybreak,
we shall strike and blood will run!

19:32.160 --> 19:34.160
Mercia will burn!

19:34.240 --> 19:36.200
[all cheering]

19:41.800 --> 19:43.440
[soldiers yelling]

19:43.520 --> 19:45.600
[villagers screaming]

19:47.360 --> 19:48.240
[woman screams]

19:49.640 --> 19:51.160
Bring me Aethelred!

19:51.240 --> 19:52.520
[woman screaming]

19:52.600 --> 19:54.280
[shouting and yelling]

19:54.360 --> 19:55.880
[yelling]

19:58.680 --> 20:00.040
[shouting]

20:00.120 --> 20:01.880
[screaming]

20:04.880 --> 20:06.120
Where is he?

20:11.040 --> 20:12.360
[Jackdaw] Where’s your Lord?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.280
Where’s your Lord?

20:14.720 --> 20:17.680
[shouting]

20:19.480 --> 20:20.520
Next!

20:21.120 --> 20:22.360
[screams]

20:25.640 --> 20:26.840
Are there any more?

20:31.680 --> 20:35.040
Could they be mercenaries...
come to help defend us?

20:35.120 --> 20:36.720
A donation from the slaver?

20:37.320 --> 20:40.480
Offering reinforcements from
the goodness of his heart?

20:40.560 --> 20:43.040
Well, perhaps they will turn away.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.960
Or they are Scots, returning for a fight.

20:48.240 --> 20:51.040
There is one choice,
though it sickens me to say it.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.080
Pay them to go away.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.200
So they can return again
and we pay them more?

20:56.280 --> 20:58.480
Why not just beg them
to make us their vassals?

20:58.560 --> 21:00.320
I did not say it was a good choice.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.440
[inhales sharply]

21:03.640 --> 21:05.400
Send men out to speak with them.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.400
If they return with heads
on their shoulders,

21:07.480 --> 21:09.480
we know that the Scots might negotiate.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.960
I shall go myself.
I am sick of sending men to slaughter.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.920
Which is why you will never lead, Aidan.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.720
Open the gate.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.680
Alert Lord Aelfric.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.800
He'll want to see this.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
[whispers]

22:45.320 --> 22:46.920
We heard you were drowned.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.720
We were assured.
They said there was no hope.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.920
I nearly did drown, Father.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.640
I believed it was my punishment
for sending you away.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.680
No punishment.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.400
Just a moment to learn
how much I wanted to live...

23:04.200 --> 23:05.960
and return to you and Bebbanburg.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.240
I thought my legacy was lost forever.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.400
I assure you,
your descendants will thrive.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.680
When I got word you were under attack,
I seized the moment.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.280
I've brought warriors...

23:17.120 --> 23:19.920
men I've collected from every corner
of the known world.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.880
Strong men, loyal men.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.400
Bebbanburg is saved.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.640
[Beocca] As magnificent as ever it was.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.920
Indeed... if it is real and not a dream.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.440
It is real enough.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.440
-We need get no closer at this point.
-Lord!

23:54.640 --> 23:55.840
Drop the sail!

23:56.600 --> 23:59.600
Row inland and keep under
the shadow of the cliff.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.560
How long do we wait for your son
to send a sign?

24:07.040 --> 24:07.960
Until it comes.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.800
It is all the will of the gods now.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.720
[Aethelflaed]
Is this some plan to become a saint?

24:33.760 --> 24:36.480
It is preparation
for the royal consecration.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.760
[Aelswith]
Becoming Queen is a now a holy rite?

24:38.840 --> 24:40.040
[Aethelflaed] The insult of it.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.480
I take it
this was also Lord Aethelhelm's idea.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.240
Yes. He is quiet,
but his ambitions for his family grow.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.600
He obsesses over the aetheling
and pushes me aside.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.760
Had I known what sort of man he was,

24:53.840 --> 24:56.280
I would've selected a different bride
for your brother.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.960
What does the King say?

24:58.280 --> 24:59.880
Edward cherishes peace...

25:00.400 --> 25:02.560
both within Wessex and within the palace.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.440
So, I must accept
when I am no longer wanted.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.640
She feels my father's loss.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.120
As do we all.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.960
I would like 17 candles lit on my behalf.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.880
One at each shrine
and no mumbling in the prayers.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.600
The Lord wants to hear your full hearts.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.880
Seventeen?

25:35.960 --> 25:37.880
Is something on your conscience, Lady?

25:37.960 --> 25:42.000
Many things. I fear I’ve allowed
too much to change in the palace.

25:42.920 --> 25:46.640
Tell me,
the young Centish lady, Ecgwynn...

25:46.720 --> 25:49.280
The girl who married your son in secret?

25:49.880 --> 25:50.800
Yes.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.760
What do you know of her present situation?

25:54.960 --> 25:58.760
She took holy orders, when her marriage
was forcibly annulled.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.560
And, from what I’ve heard,
she's very unhappy.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.960
Well, the cloistered life
may not suit a simple girl.

26:07.040 --> 26:10.080
She was forbidden from seeing
the two children she bore your son.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.040
Her daughter she sees occasionally,
but her son...

26:13.480 --> 26:16.200
she's not looked on
since he was taken from her arms.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.240
That seems a cruel punishment.

26:20.320 --> 26:24.160
For the crime of loving Edward
and Edward loving her, yes.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.560
You and Beocca are right
to question my mistreatment of her.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.560
I would like to make amends,
in a small way.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.160
-Where is her son now?
-He lives in a monastery.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.600
So, he has a love of God...

26:41.320 --> 26:42.600
but not that of a mother.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.200
An agony I would not want for my own son.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.040
-I would like to see them both.
-I can have it arranged.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.440
I am presuming
you do not want anyone else to know.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.400
It would put the boy in danger.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.680
We both know that.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.800
[Danish warriors shouting insults]

27:19.880 --> 27:21.200
[groans]

27:26.360 --> 27:29.280
[villager groaning]

27:30.320 --> 27:32.280
Send scouts to look for a battle place.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.120
Make sure the grain stores
are emptied and no food remains.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.640
Gut this palace
before the other Saxons retaliate!

27:43.840 --> 27:46.680
-[Cnut] Did you see the Ealdormen?
-I did.

27:46.760 --> 27:47.960
[both chuckle]

27:48.040 --> 27:51.400
You're inventive in your cruelty.
Have you found Aethelred?

27:51.480 --> 27:53.640
Not yet. I'm just enjoying his bed.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.960
Would you like to join me?

28:11.760 --> 28:13.960
[both grunting]

28:36.440 --> 28:38.040
[Aelswith clears throat]

28:41.840 --> 28:43.760
What are you reading, child?

28:49.120 --> 28:51.600
You are Aethelstan, are you not?

28:52.680 --> 28:54.000
Yes.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.440
Who are your family, Aethelstan?

28:58.680 --> 29:00.680
I’ve been told not to answer that.

29:01.920 --> 29:05.280
Indeed. That is probably wise.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.120
Are you an abbess, Lady?

29:08.400 --> 29:12.280
No. I am... a friend.

29:12.960 --> 29:17.400
Though many great abbesses feel
I could have been one of their number.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.040
[clears throat]

29:22.640 --> 29:24.840
Come with me, Aethelstan.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.200
A lady wants to meet you.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.680
Go to the garden.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.080
[monks chattering indistinctly]

30:42.920 --> 30:46.080
-Oh, Lord help us! It is a beggar.
-Don't look at him. Ignore him.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.960
[Brother Iestyn]
I cannot. He's heading straight for us.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.440
Travelers!

30:50.520 --> 30:52.000
[both monks sigh]

30:52.080 --> 30:53.560
He looks insane!

30:53.640 --> 30:54.640
Be wary!

30:56.120 --> 30:57.200
Ignore him.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.920
Travelers, this road
is full of murderous thieves!

31:01.680 --> 31:05.960
-Be careful, my brothers in Christ!
-Why do you call us brothers, madman?

31:06.400 --> 31:09.040
-Because I am one of your number.
-You look a beggar.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.960
No! I am a deacon,
cruelly kidnapped from his church.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.760
A boy whose mind is spent
and life is ebbing!

31:15.840 --> 31:16.960
[monks chuckling]

31:17.040 --> 31:19.400
-Let me ride with you.
-We should move on.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.400
In the name of the Virgin,
there are bandits on this road!

31:22.480 --> 31:25.480
Abandon me and I shall perish
and lie here unburied!

31:25.560 --> 31:26.920
[sighs] Come on.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.040
Please, did Christ not pity the leper?

31:30.120 --> 31:31.320
[both sigh]

31:31.400 --> 31:33.440
[both chuckling]

31:34.120 --> 31:37.280
Please, brothers.
I know about your sins in Grimesby.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.200
Don’t let me speak of it to your abbot.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.240
[scoffs]

31:43.760 --> 31:44.840
What do you want?

31:44.920 --> 31:48.640
Nothing but traveling companions.
I swear to it, I mean you no harm.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.120
-Are you any good in a fight?
-No.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.520
-Good, they can kill you while we escape.
-[Brother Oswi chuckles]

32:08.160 --> 32:09.280
[door opens]

32:27.440 --> 32:29.640
Are you the kind soul
who arranged this meeting?

32:31.480 --> 32:32.320
I am.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.040
Do I know you, madam?

32:35.120 --> 32:39.960
Content yourself with knowing that
I am a mother who feels for your plight.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.600
Then I thank you. To see him even briefly
heals a wounded heart...

32:46.080 --> 32:47.240
for both of us.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.480
You have shown us a great mercy.

32:50.920 --> 32:51.840
Tell me...

32:53.480 --> 32:55.800
am I still out of favor
to the Lady Aelswith?

32:58.120 --> 33:01.040
Lady Aelswith disfavored no one.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.280
She simply chose
what was best for her son...

33:04.880 --> 33:06.960
as you will want the best for yours.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.240
What is best for my son
is what he once had,

33:09.320 --> 33:11.160
a mother and a father living in happiness.

33:11.800 --> 33:16.240
Perhaps. What is done is done.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.760
But yes, it would be foolish for him
to be raised without a woman's nurture.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.840
Men raised by men turn savage.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.000
So we must ensure
there is always a lady to guide him...

33:29.320 --> 33:33.120
when he is permanently moved
to somewhere more secure.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.600
Why must he be moved?

33:36.360 --> 33:40.320
There is concern
that he could be in danger in Wessex.

33:41.240 --> 33:43.440
But rest assured,
he will be well-protected.

33:45.320 --> 33:48.480
But I am afraid
you will not be able to visit again.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.640
Why am I being punished?

33:58.400 --> 33:59.840
Did I deserve this cruelty?

34:00.840 --> 34:02.840
Did I hurt someone as I am now hurt?

34:03.760 --> 34:04.720
Did he?

34:06.400 --> 34:08.600
All I wanted was a husband and family!

34:09.280 --> 34:11.840
To be with the one I loved
in a quiet place to call home.

34:12.280 --> 34:17.840
Then you would have been unsuited to life
in the palace at Winchester, Ecgwynn.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.600
Which is why this has all come to pass.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.000
-Stop staring at me.
-I’m not staring.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.280
Mm-hm.

34:54.360 --> 34:58.159
I'm admiring your appetite.
Does death make you hungry?

34:58.239 --> 34:59.719
[door opens]

35:03.400 --> 35:05.600
-Have they found Aethelred?
-Yes.

35:05.680 --> 35:09.560
Good. And where
has that little turd hidden himself?

35:10.480 --> 35:13.480
He's in East Anglia.
He has attacked farms there

35:13.560 --> 35:15.520
and many Danish settlers were killed.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.880
There is no way that fool outwitted us.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.360
It sickens me to say he has.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.120
No...

35:24.720 --> 35:26.760
This was not his doing, but ours.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.600
He thought we were in Irland,
that there would be no reprisals!

35:29.680 --> 35:31.520
We have let this happen, Cnut!

35:32.560 --> 35:34.320
Then we must prevail now.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.520
[Cnut] Farmers and their families die
in war. It’s just the way of things.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.600
Danish settlers, Saxon children...

35:46.160 --> 35:47.160
they pay the price.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.520
Besides, if Aethelred has left
his people undefended,

35:50.600 --> 35:53.800
they will be easier to slaughter,
and slaughter will bring Edward sooner.

35:54.440 --> 35:58.400
[choir singing]

36:22.640 --> 36:28.480
[whispers indistinctly]

36:39.240 --> 36:43.960
[whispers indistinctly]

36:58.360 --> 37:02.320
I knew it! I said this!
I said Cnut was trying to trick us!

37:02.400 --> 37:05.320
-What of Lord Aethelred? Is he dead?
-I will try to find out.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.480
[Aelswith] Call off the coronation.
Send men to Aegelesburg to retake it.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.680
[Aethelhelm]
No, do not call off the ceremony--

37:10.760 --> 37:12.920
[Aldhelm] You cannot leave the Mercians
to their doom.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.360
[Aethelhelm] By the sounds of things,
we’re too late.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.040
[Aethelflaed] Send men... you must!

37:17.120 --> 37:21.240
What they did to humiliate the Ealdormen,
Lord King! It must be avenged!

37:21.320 --> 37:24.160
-Lord King...
-They are men of honor, men of my blood!

37:24.240 --> 37:26.200
[Aethelhelm] We should not act in haste.

37:26.280 --> 37:30.720
-[Aldhelm] Maybe Aethelred's right...
-Edward, you must not delay.

37:30.800 --> 37:31.960
Enough!

37:32.720 --> 37:35.560
I will decide how to respond
to this affront and when!

37:37.200 --> 37:40.320
Not you, nor you,
nor you will set the terms.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.280
And certainly not Cnut.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.440
[choir singing]

38:28.400 --> 38:29.880
[grunts]

38:32.960 --> 38:33.960
Hard to tell!

38:35.160 --> 38:36.960
Maybe 40 helmets!

38:37.600 --> 38:41.200
He has put all his men on the ramparts
to make it look like he has more.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.480
-He was always a cunning one.
-Still two against one.

38:44.560 --> 38:48.360
-We're twice as good.
-Yeah, keep saying it, it becomes true.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.240
[both groan]

38:50.920 --> 38:53.720
We don't need to slaughter 'em all,
just hold 'em off.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.840
Lord, the real fight
will be you against Aelfric.

39:04.560 --> 39:05.640
Tell me, Beocca...

39:08.040 --> 39:09.400
is it the right time?

39:09.840 --> 39:11.600
I'm not leading men to defeat?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.200
You are not leading men to defeat.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.400
The fight will be furious. Men will fall.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.840
But I would not encourage you,
if I thought you would lose.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.240
Feel the air here, Uhtred.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.560
Feel its cold breath.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.200
This is the air that
you and I were born to breathe.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.640
We’re meant to be here.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.040
Let us see if my blood runs thick...

39:36.480 --> 39:37.680
if the signal comes.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.360
-[Iestyn] Do you know what that is?
-It's a fort.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.680
Beating heart of this land
they called Bernicia.

39:50.960 --> 39:51.800
Bebbanburg.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.560
The lord who resides here is volatile,
so be on your guard.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.560
-What if he does not welcome us?
-Then we will not be welcomed home.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.600
And we will be forced to sail to Frisia
to sell your backside in return for food.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.520
It is only monks, Lord.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.080
Aethelred's errand boys.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.640
Let’s see how desperate they are
for my holy treasures.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.240
Greetings to Lord Aelfric of Bebbanburg.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.320
I am Brother Iestyn.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.320
We are sent by Aethelred of Mercia
to make a trade.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.880
[Aelfric] Um, you can turn back.

40:46.040 --> 40:49.480
I’ve decided I cannot bear to part
with so dear a treasure.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.880
Lord Aethelred will offer a good price.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.840
I put no price on holy relics,
nor should you.

40:58.440 --> 41:02.920
The legacy of my forebears
cannot be measured in silver.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.240
Then might we at least rest
the night here, Lord?

41:06.320 --> 41:08.080
The road has been long.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.960
Perhaps we could discuss the trade.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.520
We are not a lodging house!

41:14.000 --> 41:16.840
Your master has sent you
on a pointless errand.

41:17.480 --> 41:21.080
[Aelfric] If Aethelred wishes to reunite
the relics of the beloved saint,

41:21.160 --> 41:23.720
he’ll have to fight me for them,
sword to sword.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.000
[exhales sharply]

41:26.680 --> 41:27.640
[Young Uhtred] Lord!

41:29.240 --> 41:33.040
I am but a young man,
but since my childhood, I have heard

41:33.120 --> 41:36.560
that Bebbanburg was
the greatest fortress in the north.

41:37.040 --> 41:41.240
And that its true lord was a man of honor
and great reputation.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.400
Well, who does not take
to a little flattery?

41:44.480 --> 41:45.640
[Young Uhtred] Please, Lord.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.760
I’ve traveled many weeks
just to admire it.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.840
Reject our plea
to sell us your riches, but...

41:54.400 --> 41:56.240
do not deny my boyhood dream.

42:02.480 --> 42:06.080
Well, I am generous
and a loyal servant to the Church.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.200
So, um...

42:09.160 --> 42:10.200
you are welcome.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.800
Put them in the slave quarters.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.920
Stop looking impressed.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.000
You will push up the price.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.320
-Has he given the signal?
-Lord.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.680
Nothing.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.200
[the monks snore lightly]

43:35.800 --> 43:36.640
[gasps]

44:11.000 --> 44:12.280
Did you see that?

44:31.320 --> 44:32.360
There, look!

44:34.240 --> 44:35.240
It’s the signal!

44:38.320 --> 44:39.360
[Uhtred whistles]

44:39.440 --> 44:40.680
[Finan] Move your arses!

44:41.400 --> 44:43.000
[Uhtred] Follow us along the rocks.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.120
The rest of you stay here
until I call for the ship.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.560
[guards speaking indistinctly]

45:07.240 --> 45:09.320
[waves crash]

45:12.680 --> 45:13.720
[groans]

45:40.560 --> 45:42.040
Which one do you want?

45:43.920 --> 45:45.160
That one.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.120
All yours.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.640
-[Uhtred and Finan yell]
-[guard] Halt!

45:54.720 --> 45:56.640
[swords clanging, guards grunting]

46:01.320 --> 46:03.640
[thuds, guard screams]

46:15.240 --> 46:17.080
Do not move!

46:19.400 --> 46:20.280
Are you there?

46:24.440 --> 46:26.440
[whispers] Keep this way.
Backs against the wall.

46:27.560 --> 46:28.600
Are you there?

46:31.560 --> 46:32.560
What do we do, Lord?

46:32.880 --> 46:34.080
Do we lift the gate?

46:34.680 --> 46:37.320
-It’s worth a try.
-Come on, lift it!

46:41.160 --> 46:43.880
[Finan] On my count, one, two, three!

46:43.960 --> 46:45.680
[all groaning]

46:45.760 --> 46:48.280
[Finan] Come on! Put your back into it!

46:48.360 --> 46:49.960
Finan, stop. It’s too heavy.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.280
Move!

46:53.880 --> 46:56.080
This is a mistake. I was lost!

46:56.920 --> 46:59.480
-[Wihtgar] You were trying to steal away!
-I was not!

46:59.560 --> 47:01.560
Why? Huh? Why?

47:04.440 --> 47:05.720
[all grunting]

47:05.800 --> 47:07.680
[grunting]

47:07.760 --> 47:09.120
[panting]

47:09.200 --> 47:10.560
[Uhtred] Get me those oars.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.440
In there, Osferth.

47:16.840 --> 47:18.720
[groaning]

47:28.400 --> 47:29.520
[groaning]

47:30.960 --> 47:33.440
[groaning]

47:37.320 --> 47:38.240
[groaning]

47:40.400 --> 47:42.000
[Finan] Put your back into it!

47:42.080 --> 47:45.760
[Finan] Come on! It’s moving! Come on!

47:49.160 --> 47:50.600
[Finan] Can you get under it, Lord?

47:56.760 --> 47:58.080
[wood creaking]

47:58.160 --> 47:59.080
A little more.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.760
[all groaning]

48:01.840 --> 48:03.400
[Finan] Go on, Lord!

48:03.480 --> 48:04.800
[all groaning]

48:04.880 --> 48:06.000
[wood creaking]

48:10.640 --> 48:11.480
[wood cracks]

48:16.240 --> 48:17.760
[all panting]

48:19.160 --> 48:20.440
Summon all to the yard.

48:20.520 --> 48:21.840
[Young Uhtred pants]

48:21.920 --> 48:22.920
Get up!

48:24.280 --> 48:26.480
Let them see how we get thieves
to tell the truth.

48:26.560 --> 48:27.960
[pants]

48:31.040 --> 48:32.840
[Finan] Go on, Lord! [grunts]

48:32.920 --> 48:34.280
[Finan] Come on!

48:35.120 --> 48:38.000
[Beocca] Heave! Heave!

48:38.080 --> 48:39.160
[all groaning]

48:40.080 --> 48:42.160
[Finan] He's got it!
He's got it! He's got it!

48:43.680 --> 48:44.920
Yes! Yes!

48:46.960 --> 48:48.600
[sighs]

48:48.680 --> 48:52.120
[bell rings]

48:53.240 --> 48:56.400
-Is it a trap?
-Is it a trap we can fight our way out of?

49:02.800 --> 49:04.600
-[Wihtgar] Again, who...
-[groans]

49:05.480 --> 49:07.120
...do you really...

49:07.640 --> 49:08.560
serve?

49:09.400 --> 49:11.600
My flock and God himself!

49:11.680 --> 49:12.960
[Young Uhtred pants]

49:16.640 --> 49:19.640
-You, what is your mission?
-Simply to--

49:20.440 --> 49:23.240
[blade grates, Brother Iestyn groans]

49:23.320 --> 49:25.720
[Brother Iestyn groans]

49:31.040 --> 49:32.640
[Young Uhtred gasps and pants]

49:33.600 --> 49:36.600
Must I kill another
before I get the truth?

49:41.600 --> 49:42.840
[Young Uhtred grunts]

49:44.080 --> 49:45.560
Let the holy man go free.

49:46.760 --> 49:48.240
He means you no harm!

49:50.600 --> 49:51.440
[grunts]

49:51.520 --> 49:54.000
[groans]

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
This one schemes against us, Father.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.520
He is a spy.

50:16.440 --> 50:17.320
[Finan yells]

50:17.400 --> 50:19.360
[all grunting]

50:28.560 --> 50:29.680
[Uhtred whistles]

50:31.560 --> 50:32.560
We move on.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.240
[all panting]

50:36.640 --> 50:37.800
[Aelfric] Who sent you?

50:39.400 --> 50:40.320
Hm?

50:40.400 --> 50:44.200
You can tell me.
Have the Scots allied with Aethelred?

50:46.240 --> 50:48.240
[pants]

50:48.320 --> 50:53.520
No recognition in his eyes,
but his face... is familiar somehow.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.080
You are an imposter...

50:58.440 --> 50:59.480
but for whom?

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Who are you?

51:09.280 --> 51:12.200
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg!

51:13.800 --> 51:15.120
[all murmuring]

51:19.440 --> 51:21.400
It is unwise to mock me.

51:23.760 --> 51:24.720
Kill him.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.160
[pants heavily]

51:31.760 --> 51:33.640
[both grunting]

51:51.520 --> 51:53.400
[guard groans]

51:53.480 --> 51:55.480
[Young Uhtred pants]

51:55.560 --> 51:56.920
-Guards--
-Silence!

51:57.000 --> 51:58.360
[gasps and pants]

52:00.040 --> 52:02.680
-[Uhtred] Only I shall speak!
-[Finan] Get back!

52:05.040 --> 52:05.920
Well done!

52:07.200 --> 52:08.280
[gasps and pants]

52:09.680 --> 52:10.640
[Aelfric groans]

52:11.240 --> 52:12.320
Do you know who I am?

52:13.400 --> 52:15.040
Hm? Do you know who I am?

52:16.760 --> 52:19.320
I am the true Lord of Bebbanburg!

52:19.880 --> 52:21.280
And I am taking it back!

52:22.400 --> 52:23.880
I have no fight with you.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.200
Only this man is doomed.

52:26.880 --> 52:27.720
[Aelfric grunts]

52:27.800 --> 52:30.000
Are you happy to see me, Uncle? Huh?

52:30.280 --> 52:33.080
I have waited a lifetime to avenge myself.

52:33.760 --> 52:37.200
-I will enjoy taking my time with you! Mm?
-[Aelfric grunts]

52:38.560 --> 52:41.120
Uhtred] No one else will suffer,
if you swear loyalty.

52:41.600 --> 52:44.760
None of you are my enemies.
You are men of Bebbanburg!

52:45.160 --> 52:48.600
And, as Lord of Bebbanburg,
I will provide for and protect you!

52:50.200 --> 52:56.200
And this cruel shit, who has hated you
and mistreated you, will die.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.400
I've come home!

52:59.200 --> 53:02.440
Swear to me and you will have my oath.

53:08.320 --> 53:10.720
Aidan... you remember me?

53:11.480 --> 53:12.800
Who has your allegiance?

53:23.600 --> 53:26.880
I am loyal, to the true heir
of Bebbanburg.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.640
Good.

53:29.720 --> 53:33.520
Bear witness all,
the true heir of Bebbanburg!

53:43.680 --> 53:44.640
Who are you, boy?

53:45.640 --> 53:48.280
Wihtgar, son of Aelfric.

53:48.720 --> 53:51.640
Very much alive and back at Bebbanburg
as flesh and blood.

53:52.120 --> 53:54.680
And I could kill you with this arrow
in a heartbeat.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.760
You can try.

53:58.280 --> 53:59.600
The arrow would miss.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.920
Then you know nothing of the weapons
of the desert.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.520
Put down the bow.

54:06.480 --> 54:07.800
Put down the bow!

54:07.880 --> 54:11.120
You've lost everything, Osbert!

54:13.440 --> 54:16.440
I won’t tell you again, put down the bow!

54:24.800 --> 54:26.680
[shouting and yelling]

54:32.600 --> 54:34.800
A son does not always love a father.

54:36.280 --> 54:37.760
Learn from that, fool.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.840
Now, who’s with me?

54:39.920 --> 54:40.960
[cheering]

54:41.040 --> 54:44.160
Who is with Wihtgar of Bebbanburg?

54:44.240 --> 54:45.560
[cheering]

54:45.640 --> 54:46.920
[Finan] Get ready!

54:55.160 --> 54:56.560
[Finan] Get ready to fight!
