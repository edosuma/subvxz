-NO KIDDING.

ON THE BACK BURNER

02:53.275 --> 02:54.758

-SINCLAIR.

02:57.689 --> 02:58.965

WAS THAT COLOR GREEN,

02:58.965 --> 03:00.482

03:01.827 --> 03:03.172
CANNOT BE RE-CREATED
VERY EASILY,

03:03.172 --> 03:04.689

03:04.689 --> 03:06.137

MIKE COULD PROBABLY DO IT.

03:06.137 --> 03:07.620

"WATCH YOUR TONGUE."

03:07.620 --> 03:08.827

TOUGH TO RE-CREATE.

03:08.827 --> 03:10.000

03:10.000 --> 03:11.206
WOULD YOU GO FLATHEAD
OR SMALL-BLOCK?

03:11.206 --> 03:12.586
WELL, I WANTED TO PUT
A FLATHEAD IN IT,

03:12.586 --> 03:13.827

A GOOD ONE RIGHT NOW.

A FOUR-CYLINDER IN IT.

03:17.724 --> 03:19.137
NOW, TO BUILD A HOT ROD,

03:19.137 --> 03:20.310

03:20.310 --> 03:21.862
SO HONESTLY,
IF I WAS GONNA DO IT,

03:21.862 --> 03:24.103
I WOULD PULL THE 4-CYLINDER OUT
AND PUT A FLATHEAD V-8 IN IT.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.862

THEY'VE BEEN BUILT IN JUST ABOUT
EVERY WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE,

03:31.448 --> 03:33.241
AND FOR THIS ONE,
THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK

03:33.241 --> 03:34.689
WOULD BE NOT TO OVERDO IT

03:34.689 --> 03:37.896
AND MAKE IT INTO JUST
A SUPER COOL SHOP TRUCK,

03:37.896 --> 03:39.931
WHICH MEANS WE'D USE IT
AT THE GARAGE TO LOOK GOOD

03:39.931 --> 03:41.482
WHEN WE'RE PICKING UP PARTS
AND RUNNING ERRANDS,

03:41.482 --> 03:43.482

IT'D STILL BE A KICK-ASS,

03:43.482 --> 03:45.137
ORIGINAL GAS MONKEY HOT ROD.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.241
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO OWN
A BUSINESS

03:46.241 --> 03:48.000
AND IN NEED OF A SHOP TRUCK,
WELL,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.655
I'D EVEN BE WILLING TO PART
WITH IT FOR THE RIGHT PRICE.

03:49.655 --> 03:51.793
I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORK
ON THIS THING, MAN.

03:51.793 --> 03:54.724
I WOULD LOVE TO DO A DROPPED
AXLE, HYDRAULIC BRAKES,

03:54.724 --> 03:56.103
LEAVE THE PATINA AS IS,
YOU KNOW,

03:56.103 --> 03:57.896
AND JUST BUILD
A NICE CHASSIS,

03:57.896 --> 03:59.241
SO I COULD DRIVE IT, YOU KNOW,
AS A SHOP TRUCK, BUT...

03:59.241 --> 04:00.517
PROBABLY PUT A WINDSHIELD
IN IT, RIGHT?

04:00.517 --> 04:02.689
YEAH, WELL...

04:02.689 --> 04:04.758

AND YOU KNOW I LIKE GREEN.

04:04.758 --> 04:06.000

-UH-OH.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.620
I'VE KNOWN RICHARD
FOR A LONG TIME,

04:07.620 --> 04:09.344
AND I CAN TELL WHEN HE'S REALLY
GETTING JAZZED ABOUT SOMETHING.

04:09.344 --> 04:10.827
LOOK AT THIS
AIR CONDITIONING.

04:10.827 --> 04:11.965

04:11.965 --> 04:13.275

COOLER ALREADY.

04:13.275 --> 04:14.827
I CAN SEE THE TWINKLE
IN HIS EYE.

04:14.827 --> 04:16.413
HE WAS INTO THIS TRUCK.

04:16.413 --> 04:17.724

TO SELL ME THIS.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.275

THIS THING FOR MYSELF.

04:19.275 --> 04:20.655
I WASN'T REALLY PLANNING
ON SELLING IT.

04:20.655 --> 04:22.344

TO BUILD IT, SO...

04:22.344 --> 04:23.827
YEAH, I DO WANT TO BUILD IT,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

04:23.827 --> 04:26.275
OBVIOUSLY IT'S, LIKE,

LOOK AROUND.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.689

YOU GET TO BUILD IT.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.448

WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

04:31.448 --> 04:33.344
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU
JUST GO FIND EVERYWHERE.

04:33.344 --> 04:34.517
IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO FIND THIS TRUCK,

04:34.517 --> 04:35.620
SO IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE CHEAP.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.241
WELL, HERE'S
THE TRICKY TRICK.

04:37.241 --> 04:39.965

RIGHT IN THERE, JUST ABOUT.

Y'ALL REMEMBER A WHILE BACK,

04:45.034 --> 04:46.620

04:46.620 --> 04:48.758
AND ACCIDENTALLY, ON PURPOSE,
ENDED UP WITH A FLATHEAD MOTOR.

04:48.758 --> 04:52.241

LAST NIGHT, BUT NO WAY.

04:52.241 --> 04:54.172
CHECK THAT BABY OUT.

04:54.172 --> 04:55.379

FOR THIS STUFF?

04:55.379 --> 04:56.793
$8,500.

04:56.793 --> 04:58.172
YOU SAID I'LL HAVE 8,500 CASH
WHEN YOU GET HERE.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.724
Tony: I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOT
IT FOR LESS THAN THAT

04:59.724 --> 05:01.448
IF I WAS HANDLING THE DEAL
ON THE INTERNET, BUT...

05:01.448 --> 05:02.793
SHUT UP, TONY.

05:02.793 --> 05:04.068
Richard: I ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS
JUST A MATTER OF TIME

05:04.068 --> 05:05.551
BEFORE I'D HAVE
A GOOD USE FOR IT.

05:05.551 --> 05:07.379
WELL, IF I MAKE THE RIGHT
DEAL WITH BRIAN,

05:07.379 --> 05:08.448
THAT TIME COULD BE NOW.

05:08.448 --> 05:11.793

05:11.793 --> 05:13.689
$15,000?

05:13.689 --> 05:15.275
BASS HIT ME AT $15,000,

05:15.275 --> 05:17.517
AND I KNEW THAT I WAS NOT GONNA
GET HIM TO MOVE AN INCH.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.172
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE HE MIGHT BE
CHARGING ME 1,000 PER YEAR

05:20.172 --> 05:22.034
OF KNOWING ME
AND PUTTING UP WITH ME.

05:22.034 --> 05:23.620
MAYBE THAT'S WHERE HE CAME UP
WITH THE NUMBER.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.103
I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA
GET YOU OFF $15,000.

05:25.103 --> 05:26.137
NO.

05:26.137 --> 05:27.172
I DON'T HAVE TO SELL IT,

05:27.172 --> 05:28.310
AND IT'S A SELLER'S
MARKET RIGHT NOW.

05:32.034 --> 05:32.965
ALL RIGHT.
[BLEEP] IT.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.310
LET'S DO IT.
-HEY.

05:34.310 --> 05:36.482
GOD, THAT WAS THE EASIEST
NEGOTIATION I'VE EVER SEEN.

05:36.482 --> 05:37.724
HELL YEAH.

05:37.724 --> 05:38.862
PLUS IT'S, LIKE,
THE FIRST THING

05:38.862 --> 05:39.827
I'VE EVER BOUGHT OUT
OF THIS SHOP.

05:39.827 --> 05:41.068
IF I'M GONNA SELL THIS TRUCK,

05:41.068 --> 05:42.448
I'D MUCH RATHER SELL IT
TO RICHARD

05:42.448 --> 05:43.758
AND GET TO BE ON BOARD
BUILDING IT THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

05:43.758 --> 05:45.103
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY
THE IDEAL SITUATION --

05:45.103 --> 05:46.551
SELL IT TO HIM,
COLLECT THAT MONEY

05:46.551 --> 05:48.206
AND THEN COLLECT MORE MONEY
FOR BUILDING IT?

05:48.206 --> 05:49.793
DUDE, THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

05:49.793 --> 05:51.206
WHAT DO WE GOT TO DO?
DO WE GOT TO PULL
IT OFF THE FRAME?

05:51.206 --> 05:52.689
-I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD DO.
-OKAY.

05:52.689 --> 05:54.862
I WOULD PULL IT ALL APART,
GET IT DOWN TO A BARE FRAME,

05:54.862 --> 05:57.482
DO A DROPPED AXLE IN THE FRONT,
DO A STOCK REAR END

05:57.482 --> 06:00.103
BUT WITH DIFFERENT GEARS,
DO A NEWER TRANSMISSION

06:00.103 --> 06:01.551
AND THEN DO A REALLY
NICE INTERIOR,

06:01.551 --> 06:03.379
PAINT THE FIREWALL
AND PUT YOUR FLATHEAD IN IT.

06:03.379 --> 06:05.448
ARE WE PAINTING THE CHASSIS,
TOO, WHILE WE GOT IT OUT?

06:05.448 --> 06:06.931
I WOULD PAINT
THE CHASSIS.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.827
I WOULD JUST PICK A GREEN
IN THIS GENERAL AREA HERE

06:08.827 --> 06:11.379
AND PAINT
THE CHASSIS THAT COLOR.

06:11.379 --> 06:13.137
Richard: HERE'S THE PLAN --
WE'LL TAKE THIS FORD MODEL B

06:13.137 --> 06:15.034
AND MAKE IT INTO
A VINTAGE-LOOKING SHOP TRUCK,

06:15.034 --> 06:17.172
READY TO RUN PARTS
OR JUST LOOKING COOL.

06:17.172 --> 06:18.620
WE'LL KEEP THE 85 YEARS
OF PATINA,

06:18.620 --> 06:20.310

AND THAT MIGHT BE
BECAUSE RICHARD HAS BROUGHT THEM

13:39.517 --> 13:40.620
SO MANY SURPRISES IN THE PAST,

13:40.620 --> 13:42.000
BUT I KNOW A SOLID TRUCK
WHEN I SEE ONE,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
AND THE FRAME UNDER THIS ONE
IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.827
NOW, SOME MIGHT SEE THE LITTLE
BIT OF RUST AS A PROBLEM,

13:45.827 --> 13:47.827
BUT I SEE THAT AS 85 YEARS
WORTH OF CHARACTER,

13:47.827 --> 13:49.655
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'RE KEEPING THE PATINA.

13:49.655 --> 13:52.551
SO THE MOTOR SHOULD
COME OUT THEN.

13:52.551 --> 13:54.068
-OOH, MOTOR IS DETACHED.
-ALL RIGHT.

13:54.068 --> 13:55.724
THAT'S EVERYTHING
ON THE FRONT, ISN'T IT?

13:55.724 --> 13:57.724
GOOD JOB.
THAT MOTOR MIGHT BE GOOD.

13:57.724 --> 13:59.103
Brian:
PLAYING BY RICHARD'S RULES,

13:59.103 --> 14:00.620
TRYING TO GET THIS TRUCK DONE
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE,

14:00.620 --> 14:02.551
THAT'S, FOR SURE, GONNA BE
A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.551
ALL RIGHT.
WAITING FOR THE RELEASE.

14:04.551 --> 14:06.689
OH, THERE IT IS.

14:06.689 --> 14:09.586
BUT IT'S HIS TRUCK NOW, AND HE'S
PAYING ME TO APPLY MY VISION.

14:09.586 --> 14:12.275
WELL, THAT'S A SWEET DEAL
FOR ME.

14:12.275 --> 14:13.689
CAN RICHARD MAKE
SOME MONEY ON IT?

14:13.689 --> 14:15.551
WELL, THAT'S UP TO HIM.

14:15.551 --> 14:17.344
BYE, FRAME.

14:17.344 --> 14:19.034
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

14:19.034 --> 14:27.586
♪♪

14:27.586 --> 14:36.206
♪♪

14:36.206 --> 14:37.689
Jason: WE'LL LET YOU GUYS
DO YOUR THING FIRST,

14:37.689 --> 14:39.517
AND THEN I'LL DO
THE MECHANIC WORK AFTER THAT.

14:39.517 --> 14:40.896
IT'S EITHER GOT SOME REALLY
BAD GAS IN IT

14:40.896 --> 14:42.241
OR A COUPLE OF DEAD PLUGS.

14:42.241 --> 14:43.655
Mike:
TONY'S GOT BAD GAS.

14:43.655 --> 14:45.689
Tony:
THAT WAS YESTERDAY.

14:45.689 --> 14:47.896
SO THIS IS WHAT'S SUPER COOL.
MY 'CUDA JUST GOT HERE.

14:47.896 --> 14:51.000
THESE GUYS HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET,
BUT SUPER RAD, SUBLIME GREEN,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.413
BUT IT'S GOT ALL THE NEW BELLS
AND WHISTLES,

14:52.413 --> 14:54.034
YOU KNOW, MODERN MOTOR,
MODERN TRANS,

14:54.034 --> 14:56.689
FOUR-WHEEL BRAKES,
COILOVER SUSPENSION,

14:56.689 --> 14:59.965
BEAUTIFUL PAINT AND BODY, AND I
STOLE IT FOR ONLY 45 GRAND.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.137
WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK OF THAT?

15:02.137 --> 15:04.137
-WHAT PART OF THAT?
-IT'S PRETTY DECENT.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.517
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MAN?

15:05.517 --> 15:07.862
IT'S ALSO GOT A 5-SPEED IN IT
INSTEAD OF A 4-SPEED.

15:07.862 --> 15:09.379
-YEAH, NO, THAT'S...
-YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

15:09.379 --> 15:11.310
I STOLE THIS CAR
FOR ONLY 45 GRAND.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.310
HEY, I FEEL BETTER ABOUT WHAT
WE KNOW THAN IF HE STOLE IT.

15:14.310 --> 15:15.931
WAIT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THINK

15:15.931 --> 15:17.551
THEY KNOW,
BUT HERE'S WHAT I KNOW,

15:17.551 --> 15:20.551
THAT YOU AT HOME NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT HOW I GOT THIS '70 'CUDA.

15:23.344 --> 15:24.896
I WAS IN FLORIDA
CHECKING OUT A SHOP

15:24.896 --> 15:27.068
I INVESTED IN FOR MY SHOW,
"GARAGE REHAB."

15:27.068 --> 15:28.586
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN IT.

15:28.586 --> 15:30.448
ANYWAYS, I WAS TAKING CARE OF
BUSINESS WITH CHRIS AND RUSSELL.

15:30.448 --> 15:32.482
BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE
THE AUDIO WORK THAT THEY DO.

15:32.482 --> 15:34.344
THEY HAVE ALL THE AIR
SUSPENSION THEY DO,

15:34.344 --> 15:36.000
SO EACH ONE CAN HAVE
A DESIGNATED AREA

15:36.000 --> 15:37.896
WITH THE SPECIALTY EQUIPMENT
AS NEEDED.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.586
WHAT'S THAT?
IS IT YOURS?

15:39.586 --> 15:40.862
NO, IT AIN'T MINE.

15:40.862 --> 15:42.034
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
YOU'D OWN.

15:42.034 --> 15:43.344
LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING YOU DID.

15:43.344 --> 15:45.620
-YO!
-YES, SIR?

15:45.620 --> 15:47.103
WHERE THE [BLEEP]
IS MARK DICKS?

15:47.103 --> 15:48.965
APPARENTLY, THIS GUY HAD LEFT
HIS MOTORCYCLE

15:48.965 --> 15:50.310
AT THE SHOP TO BE REPAIRED.

15:50.310 --> 15:52.206
AFTER I CALMED HIM DOWN,
I WANTED TO FIND OUT

15:52.206 --> 15:53.551
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT CAUGHT MY EYE.

15:53.551 --> 15:55.137
WHAT'S THAT?
THAT'S MY 'CUDA.

15:55.137 --> 15:57.517
HEY, Y'ALL GET TO WORK.

15:57.517 --> 16:00.137
NOW, I LOVE BARRACUDAS,
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE GREEN.

16:00.137 --> 16:02.482
THESE CARS ARE HOT RIGHT NOW,
AND THOSE CRAZY MOPAR COLLECTORS

16:02.482 --> 16:05.068
HAVE LAID OUT TONS OF CASH
FOR THESE LIMITED-RUN BEAUTIES.

16:05.068 --> 16:06.620
-ALL THE WAY AROUND, RIGHT?
-THAT'S COOL.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.620
IT'S GOT A THREE-LENGTH DRAG
REAR END, LIMITED SLIP.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.689
IT'S GOT A TREMEC 5-SPEED,
AIR CONDITIONING.

16:10.689 --> 16:12.103
THAT'S PRETTY RAD ACTUALLY.

16:12.103 --> 16:14.344
NOT NUMBERS-MATCHING,
BUT A LOT OF MODERN UPGRADES,

16:14.344 --> 16:15.827
AND THAT SPELLED PROFIT
IF I COULD GET IT

16:15.827 --> 16:18.172
FOR THE RIGHT PRICE,
SO I TOOK IT FOR A RIDE.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.793
WHOA!

16:23.793 --> 16:25.724
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BINDING UP
ON THE TRANNY, TOO.

16:25.724 --> 16:28.000
OKAY, IT HAD SOME MINOR
MECHANICAL ISSUES,

16:28.000 --> 16:29.620
BUT NOTHING MY GUYS CAN'T FIX,

16:29.620 --> 16:31.103
BUT IT HAD PRISTINE
PAINT AND BODY,

16:31.103 --> 16:34.862
WHICH IS THE EXPENSIVE PART,
SO I MADE HIM AN OFFER.

16:34.862 --> 16:36.241
I'D DO $45,000.

16:36.241 --> 16:38.793
YOU GOT CASH MONEY?I ALWAYS HAVE CASH MONEY.

16:40.620 --> 16:41.965
LET'S GO GET YOU
SOME CASH,

16:41.965 --> 16:43.034
AS LONG AS RUSSELL
DIDN'T SPEND IT ALL.

16:43.034 --> 16:45.862
COME ON IN.

16:45.862 --> 16:48.310
SO I STOLE THIS GORGEOUS
'70 'CUDA FOR 45 GRAND,

16:48.310 --> 16:51.896
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
THE MONKEYS ARE WHINING ALREADY.

16:51.896 --> 16:53.379
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

16:53.379 --> 16:56.068
IT'S GOT A PROBLEM.

16:56.068 --> 16:57.827
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
[BLEEP] KIDDING ME.

16:57.827 --> 16:59.206
YOUR TRANSPORT DRIVER.

16:59.206 --> 17:01.103
SOMEHOW WHEN I HAD THIS CAR
SHIPPED TO TEXAS,

17:01.103 --> 17:02.448
IT GOT CRUNCHED.

17:02.448 --> 17:03.655
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I BOUGHT THE CAR

17:03.655 --> 17:05.310
IS PAINT
AND BODY IS SO EXPENSIVE.

17:05.310 --> 17:08.275
NOW IT'S GONNA COST ME TO FIX
IT, WHICH MEANS LESS PROFIT.

17:08.275 --> 17:09.482
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

17:09.482 --> 17:11.655
I BOUGHT A CAR
THAT WAS MECHANICALLY EH

17:11.655 --> 17:14.068
BECAUSE IT WAS PERFECT INTERIOR
AND PAINT AND BODY,

17:14.068 --> 17:15.620
SO LET'S GET IT INTO PAINT
AND BODY FIRST

17:15.620 --> 17:17.862
BECAUSE WE'RE BUSY OVER THERE
AND THEN GET IT OVER TO YOU.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.241
OKAY. AND JUST START
AT THE VERY FRONT.

17:19.241 --> 17:20.862
GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK,
EVERY SINGLE THING,

17:20.862 --> 17:22.172
JUST CHECK IT.

17:22.172 --> 17:23.413
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY?
-WHAT'S THAT?

17:23.413 --> 17:25.551
"NO REALLY GOOD DEAL
GOES UNPUNISHED."

17:25.551 --> 17:26.931
I THINK IT'S GOOD DEED.

17:26.931 --> 17:28.068
GOOD [BLEEP] DEAL.

17:28.068 --> 17:30.448
IT'S GOOD DEED.

17:30.448 --> 17:32.517
THAT THING
DOES SOUND BAD.

17:36.241 --> 17:37.551
Jason: YOU KNOW
WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THIS

17:37.551 --> 17:40.379
IS RICHARD ALWAYS WANTS
TO BUILD A SHOP TRUCK,

17:40.379 --> 17:42.413
BUT WE'VE BUILT, LIKE,
THREE SHOP TRUCKS,

17:42.413 --> 17:44.000
AND IF YOU NOTICE,
NONE OF THEM ARE STILL HERE.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.172
-YEAH, I'M LOOKING...
-BECAUSE HE SELLS THEM

17:45.172 --> 17:46.275
BEFORE WE CAN EVEN GET
A CHANCE TO USE THEM.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.724
YOU GUYS ARE SAYING THAT.

17:47.724 --> 17:48.586
I'M LOOKING AROUND,
"WHERE IS THE SHOP TRUCK?"

17:48.586 --> 17:49.827
YEAH, EXACTLY.

17:49.827 --> 17:51.241
Brian: IT'S ONLY DAY 2
OF THE '33 MODEL B BUILD,

17:51.241 --> 17:52.275
BUT WE'RE WELL UNDER WAY.

17:52.275 --> 17:53.448
WE GOT THE TRUCK
BLOWN APART YESTERDAY,

17:53.448 --> 17:54.793
AND WHILE THE FRAME
IS AT THE SANDBLASTER,

17:54.793 --> 17:56.206
I'M GOING TO GET TOGETHER
WITH JEREMY

17:56.206 --> 17:57.620
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO
ABOUT THE PIECE OF FENDER

17:57.620 --> 18:00.551
MISSING FROM THE RIGHT REAR.

18:00.551 --> 18:02.586
THAT FENDER WILL BE THE BEST
PLACE TO START, IN MY OPINION,

18:02.586 --> 18:04.103
BECAUSE
IT'S THE WORST ONE.

18:04.103 --> 18:06.172
IS THIS IS A "STICK IT BACK
TOGETHER AS CLOSE AS IT CAN BE

18:06.172 --> 18:07.931
AND PUT A BIG OLD FAT
MIG-WELD ON IT?"

18:07.931 --> 18:08.965
-NO.
-NO.

18:08.965 --> 18:10.068
I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT...

18:10.068 --> 18:11.620
TREAT IT LIKE WE'RE DOING
ANYTHING ELSE

18:11.620 --> 18:12.724
IN CASE
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE,

18:12.724 --> 18:13.827
SOMEONE WANTS
TO MAKE THIS THING

18:13.827 --> 18:15.931
INTO A NICELY PAINTED,
FINISHED TRUCK.

18:15.931 --> 18:17.103
YEAH.

18:17.103 --> 18:18.344
THEN AT LEAST GIVE THEM
A HEAD START.

18:18.344 --> 18:19.896
WITH ONLY 2 WEEKS TO FINISH
THE BUILD,

18:19.896 --> 18:21.413
IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO DO THINGS
THE QUICK AND DIRTY WAY,

18:21.413 --> 18:22.862
BUT THAT'S NOT MY STYLE.

18:22.862 --> 18:24.517
I'VE NEVER DONE THAT WORKING
BY MYSELF,

18:24.517 --> 18:26.965
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE GAS
MONKEY'S SCHEDULE CHANGE THAT.

18:26.965 --> 18:29.103
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GONNA GO
CRAZY WITH THE METALWORK,

18:29.103 --> 18:31.137
BUT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
WE NEED TO FIX JUST FOR...

18:31.137 --> 18:32.655
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE IT USABLE.

18:32.655 --> 18:35.586
ANYTHING WE'RE DOING NEEDS
TO BE DONE RIGHT.

18:35.586 --> 18:38.172
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A CRUSTY,
OLD, BEAT-UP TRUCK,

18:38.172 --> 18:39.448
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO LOOK AT IT AND SAY,

18:39.448 --> 18:41.689
"OH, THEY DID
TERRIBLE WORK."

18:41.689 --> 18:43.206
RICHARD, HE SEEMS TO THINK
IT'S FAST AND EASY

18:43.206 --> 18:45.172
JUST TO GRAFT A PIECE
ONTO THE EXISTING FENDER.

18:45.172 --> 18:47.068
NOW, I PICKED UP A REPOP
WHEN IT WAS STILL MY PROJECT,

18:47.068 --> 18:48.931
BUT THERE'S STILL THE QUESTION
OF MATCHING THE PATINA.

18:48.931 --> 18:50.551
LET ME GO GET MIKE AND SEE
WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT THIS.

18:50.551 --> 18:51.862
Jeremy: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, SHOOT.

18:51.862 --> 18:52.931
MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION
IS GONNA HAVE

18:52.931 --> 18:54.172
TO INCLUDE
THE PAINT DEPARTMENT.

18:54.172 --> 18:55.965
ALL RIGHT.
I FOUND THE NEW FENDER.

18:55.965 --> 18:58.965
YOU BROUGHT MIKE
WITH YOU.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.482
OUR QUESTION FOR YOU,
MIKE, IS,

19:01.482 --> 19:04.965
WHAT IS FASTER AND BETTER
FOR THIS PARTICULAR JOB?

19:04.965 --> 19:06.448
RICHARD TALKED ABOUT
GRAFTING THE FENDER

19:06.448 --> 19:08.965
AND KEEPING THE PATINA,
BUT HONESTLY,

19:08.965 --> 19:10.793
I THINK IF YOU CAN MATCH
THIS PATINA

19:10.793 --> 19:12.344
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE THE OTHER FENDER

19:12.344 --> 19:14.620
AND KIND OF WHAT'S LEFT HERE,
THAT WOULD BE WAY FASTER.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.586
IF YOU WANT ME TO DO A PATINA
MATCH ON THAT, I CAN DO THAT.

19:17.586 --> 19:18.896
LET'S DO THE WHOLE FENDER.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.241
I'LL HAVE TO FIND
ALL OF THOSE COLORS.

19:20.241 --> 19:21.689
YEAH.
THERE'S ABOUT 50 COLORS

19:21.689 --> 19:23.344
IN, LIKE,
1 SQUARE-INCH HERE, SO...

19:23.344 --> 19:24.896
I THINK GOING WITH A WHOLE
NEW FENDER IS THE RIGHT CALL.

19:24.896 --> 19:26.586
THIS WAY I CAN HAVE JEREMY
MOVE ON TO OTHER WORK

19:26.586 --> 19:29.586
WHILE MIKE MATCHES THE PATINA.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.724
I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

19:30.724 --> 19:33.000
ALL RIGHT.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.827
Mike:
WELL, DO ME A FAVOR.

19:34.827 --> 19:36.862
TAKE THAT FENDER OFF,
AND LET ME HAVE THAT FENDER.

19:36.862 --> 19:39.655
DEAL.

19:39.655 --> 19:41.310
Narrator:
COMING UP ON "FAST N' LOUD"...

19:41.310 --> 19:42.724
THERE IS
A SERIOUS VIBRATION.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.241
...IT'S A 'CUDA CALAMITY...

19:44.241 --> 19:45.448
DAMN, THIS THING
SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

19:45.448 --> 19:47.068
OH, YEAH.

19:47.068 --> 19:51.034
...AS THE MONKEYS TAKE THEIR
FRUSTRATION OUT ON THE '33 FORD.

19:51.034 --> 19:53.103
I DON'T REMEMBER TELLING YOU
IT WAS OKAY TO TEAR IT UP.

19:53.103 --> 19:55.103
YES, YOU DID.

20:00.344 --> 20:02.379
-HERE'S THE TAILGATE.
-SO JUMP ON IT?

20:02.379 --> 20:03.655
Brian: THAT'S HOW
I WOULD DO IT.

20:03.655 --> 20:07.344
SO DO IT MORE LIKE A...

20:07.344 --> 20:08.482
NOT LIKE THAT.
NOT LIKE...

20:08.482 --> 20:09.965
MORE LIKE A SKATEBOARD?

20:09.965 --> 20:11.310
NO, NO.
DON'T DROP IN.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.482
STRAIGHT OFF THE...
DON'T DROP IN ON IT?

20:12.482 --> 20:13.793
DON'T DROP IN ON IT.

20:13.793 --> 20:14.827
Brian: THE TAILGATE
ON THE '33 FORD

20:14.827 --> 20:16.137
HAS DEFINITELY
TAKEN SOME LICKS,

20:16.137 --> 20:17.413
SO OLD TONY HAWK HERE
IS GONNA STRAIGHTEN IT OUT

20:17.413 --> 20:19.551
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.137
GENTLY, TOO.
GENTLY JUMP?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.517
GENTLY JUMP ON IT.

20:22.517 --> 20:24.000
GENTLY PLACE
MY HEAVY ASS ON IT?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.206
GENTLY PLACE
YOUR HEAVY ASS ON IT.

20:26.206 --> 20:27.689
WHEN YOU'RE
STRAIGHTENING OUT METAL

20:27.689 --> 20:29.413
ON AN 85-YEAR-OLD TRUCK,
SOMETIMES YOUR OWN TWO FEET WORK

20:29.413 --> 20:31.551
AS GOOD AS $10,000
WORTH OF HEAVY MACHINERY.

20:31.551 --> 20:34.655
SEE, IT'S LIKE
A TRAMPOLINE OF STEEL.

20:34.655 --> 20:36.241
IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING,
SO YOU SEE THAT, RICHARD?

20:36.241 --> 20:38.586
A LITTLE DOWN-HOME INGENUITY
CAN SAVE YOU SOME BUCKS.

20:38.586 --> 20:40.517
I THINK YOU ACTUALLY ARE
FIXING IT RIGHT NOW.

20:40.517 --> 20:42.000
ALL RIGHT.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.275
JEREMY STILL NEEDS TO WELD UP
A COUPLE OF ROUGH SPOTS

20:43.275 --> 20:44.793
ON THE TAILGATE BEFORE
HANDING IT OFF TO MIKE.

20:44.793 --> 20:46.379
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M DOING A ONCE-OVER

20:46.379 --> 20:48.655
ON THE '39 TRANSMISSION
I'VE BEEN SAVING FOR THIS TRUCK.

20:48.655 --> 20:50.275
UGH, THAT'S PRETTY GROSS.

20:50.275 --> 20:52.931
YOU WANT SOME OF THIS?
IT'S LIKE THE...

20:52.931 --> 20:54.310
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR MOM
WOULD BAKE YOU A CAKE,

20:54.310 --> 20:57.275
AND SHE'D LET YOU
LICK THE SPATULA.

20:57.275 --> 20:59.793
WHOA!
SLINGING SOME GOO YOUR WAY.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.413
SORRY.

21:01.413 --> 21:03.034
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE
IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK RIGHT NOW,

21:03.034 --> 21:04.137
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.689
JUST HAVE TO CLEAN UP
THE OUTSIDE,

21:05.689 --> 21:07.655
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING INSIDE
IS AS GOOD AS I THINK IT IS

21:07.655 --> 21:10.172
AND REBUILD IT LATER BEFORE
BOLTING IT INTO THE TRUCK.

21:10.172 --> 21:11.448
HOPEFULLY SOMEONE HID,

21:11.448 --> 21:13.241
LIKE, THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS INSIDE HERE.

21:13.241 --> 21:15.275
UGH, NO.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.793
SEE, IT LOOKS
PRETTY NICE INSIDE.

21:16.793 --> 21:19.275
IT'S REALLY CLEAN.
I THINK THAT'S GONNA WORK.

21:19.275 --> 21:21.517
LOOK.
"'39 FORD."

21:21.517 --> 21:23.620
IT'S KIND OF, LIKE, THE ORIGINAL
HOT-ROD TRANSMISSION.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.137
EVERYBODY THAT HAD A FLATHEAD
IN THEIR HOT ROD,

21:25.137 --> 21:28.000
THEY WANTED THIS TRANSMISSION
BECAUSE IT HAD A FLOOR SHIFT

21:28.000 --> 21:29.275
AND CAN HOLD UP TO
A LITTLE MORE HORSEPOWER.

21:29.275 --> 21:30.896
IT'S A LITTLE GUY.

21:30.896 --> 21:32.103
IT'S JUST A LITTLE FELLA.

21:32.103 --> 21:33.586
THIS TRANSMISSION
IS IN GOOD SHAPE,

21:33.586 --> 21:34.896
SO I'LL SEND IT OVER TO MIKE
TO PAINT IT ALONG

21:34.896 --> 21:36.448
WITH THE INTERIOR OF THE CAB.

STEER VERY WELL.

JUST FINE.

21:43.586 --> 21:45.241

ELECTRIC TRUCKS.

PERFECT.

22:05.413 --> 22:10.068
COY AND TONY DID A FANTASTIC JOB
ON THE PAINT AND BODY REPAIR,

22:10.068 --> 22:12.655
BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM
IS HOW THIS THING DRIVES.

22:12.655 --> 22:15.103

UP ON THE TRANNY.

22:15.103 --> 22:18.103
OKAY, SO WHEN I BOUGHT
THIS CAR...

22:18.103 --> 22:19.379
IT DOESN'T SHIFT SUPER WELL.
-YEP.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.448
IT'S GOT A WEIRD NOISE
IN THE REAR END,

22:21.448 --> 22:24.689
AND IT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TIRES,
SO WE NEED TO GIVE IT

22:24.689 --> 22:26.517
A GOOD ONE-THROUGH
FROM THE FRONT TO THE BACK.

22:26.517 --> 22:28.482
SO MOPARS ARE ALWAYS HOT,
AND A '70 'CUDA

22:28.482 --> 22:29.896
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A POPULAR CAR,

22:29.896 --> 22:31.655

TOP DOLLAR FOR THEM,

22:31.655 --> 22:33.482
ESPECIALLY ONE
IN THIS CONDITION,

22:33.482 --> 22:35.344

FOR SALE ON THE OLD INTERWEBS.

THAN ANSWERS.

WE'RE NOT REAL SURE WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THE REAR END,

WE'RE KEEPING THE PATINA,
BUT MIKE GOT A JUMP START

28:26.896 --> 28:29.103
ON PAINTING THE INTERIOR
AND SANDBLASTING THE FIREWALL.

28:29.103 --> 28:31.448
WHEN YOU SANDBLASTED THIS,
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT

28:31.448 --> 28:33.586
THAT IT'S BACKWARDS BACK HERE?

28:33.586 --> 28:35.034
-YEAH, I DIDN'T CARE.
-YOU DIDN'T CARE.

28:35.034 --> 28:37.241
FAIR ENOUGH.
-WE'RE GETTING NEW GLASS ANYWAY.

28:37.241 --> 28:38.862
I LIKE THE TAN COLOR.
HOW WE DOING ON TIME?

28:38.862 --> 28:41.620
WE'RE ONLY 2 1/2 DAYS IN
RIGHT NOW BY MY CLOCK.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.931
SO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU
IS A SECRET.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.275
I MEAN, THIS MIGHT BE A NEW
PRODUCTIVITY RECORD

28:45.275 --> 28:46.965
FOR THE MONKEYS,
AND I CAN'T TELL THEM THAT

28:46.965 --> 28:48.793
BECAUSE THEN THEY MIGHT DREAM UP
A WHOLE BUNCH OF EXTRA [BLEEP]

28:48.793 --> 28:51.862
TO DO AND BLOW THEIR LEAD
ON THIS TRUCK, SO ZIP IT.

28:51.862 --> 28:53.379
WHAT COLOR WE PAINTING
THE FRAME?

28:53.379 --> 28:56.310
SAME AS THE BODY, THAT KIND OF
OF FADED-GREEN-LOOKING COLOR.

28:56.310 --> 28:57.413
AND WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE BED

28:57.413 --> 28:58.724
BECAUSE I SAW
IT HAS A RIP IN IT?

28:58.724 --> 29:01.482
THE BED FLOOR IS...
IT'S KIND OF TRASHED.

29:01.482 --> 29:03.172
WE WANT TO WELD IT UP.

29:03.172 --> 29:04.379
-WE'RE GONNA FIX THAT.
-YEAH, WE'RE GONNA WELD IT UP,

29:04.379 --> 29:05.827
AND WE'RE GOING
TO MATTE CLEAR IT.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.103
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE
ALL THE REST OF IT OLD.

29:08.103 --> 29:09.551
SOME KIND OF COATING
SO THAT WHATEVER HE PUTS

29:09.551 --> 29:10.931
ON THE BACK ON HERE
DOESN'T TRANSFER THE RUST

29:10.931 --> 29:12.310
TO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE PUTTING IN HERE.

29:12.310 --> 29:13.862
Richard:
WHAT'S THAT HOLE FOR?

29:13.862 --> 29:15.137
YOU PUT A PENNY DOWN THERE,
AND IT STARTS THE TRUCK UP.

29:15.137 --> 29:16.241
THIS IS TRICKY

29:16.241 --> 29:17.931
BECAUSE IF WE PUT
TOO MUCH INTO THIS BUILD

29:17.931 --> 29:19.862
AND MAKE IT TOO COOL,
THE COST GOES UP,

29:19.862 --> 29:21.931
AND THE NUMBER OF BUYERS
THAT MIGHT WANT IT GOES DOWN,

29:21.931 --> 29:23.862

HAVE RECORDED THAT.

LOOK.
NO.

35:54.862 --> 35:57.689
LOOK.
NO.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.068
YES, LOOK.

35:59.068 --> 36:00.827
NO. NO.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.103
NO, BECAUSE
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING

36:02.103 --> 36:03.379
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
WITH THAT PICTURE.

36:03.379 --> 36:05.344
I KNOW YOU.
NO, NO.

36:05.344 --> 36:06.586
I'M NOT DOING IT.

36:06.586 --> 36:08.379
WHAT ARE YOU WANT?
YOU [BLEEP]

36:08.379 --> 36:09.758
SUCH AN ASS.

36:09.758 --> 36:13.000
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU GOT THAT.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.655
YOU'RE AN ASS.
[ SIGHS ]

36:19.137 --> 36:21.103
Brian: HAVEN'T LOOKED
IN THE PARTS WASHER

36:21.103 --> 36:22.172
FOR, LIKE, THREE DAYS.

36:22.172 --> 36:23.413
IT'S STILL DIRTY.

36:23.413 --> 36:25.068
TRANSMISSION REPAIR
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

36:25.068 --> 36:26.793
REALLY, YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT
TO A PROFESSIONAL,

36:26.793 --> 36:28.413
AND AM I PROFESSIONAL
TRANSMISSION GUY?

36:28.413 --> 36:30.344
NO, BUT I'M GONNA PUT IT
TOGETHER ANYWAY.

36:32.862 --> 36:34.275
THIS IS ACTUALLY
THE TRANSMISSION

36:34.275 --> 36:35.793
WE'RE USING IN THIS TRUCK,

36:35.793 --> 36:38.068
AND IT LOOKS LIKE AN ANTIQUE
BECAUSE IT IS AN ANTIQUE.

36:38.068 --> 36:42.137
IT'S ONLY 6 YEARS NEWER THAN
THE TRUCK WE'RE PUTTING IT IN,

36:42.137 --> 36:43.655
SO 1939 TRANSMISSION.

36:43.655 --> 36:46.413
OUR TRUCK IS 1933, BUT THIS IS
A MUCH STRONGER TRANSMISSION

36:46.413 --> 36:48.827
THAN THE TRUCK WAS MADE WITH,
SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

36:48.827 --> 36:50.103
IT'S AN UPGRADE.

36:50.103 --> 36:51.482
HOT RODDERS HAVE BEEN
DOING IT FOR YEARS,

36:51.482 --> 36:52.793
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
TO USE IN OUR TRUCK,

36:52.793 --> 36:54.310
SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BUILDING
A SHOP TRUCK

36:54.310 --> 36:55.827
FOR RUNNING GARAGE ERRANDS
AND WHATNOT,

36:55.827 --> 36:56.931
WE'RE STILL MAKING A HOT ROD.

36:56.931 --> 36:58.413
IF IT HAS THE GAS MONKEY
NAME ON IT,

36:58.413 --> 36:59.931
YOU CAN BET IT'S GOING
TO BE A HOT ROD.

36:59.931 --> 37:01.931
WE HAVE TO PULL THE OLD BEARINGS
OFF OF ALL THE PARTS HERE

37:01.931 --> 37:03.517
AND PUT THE NEW BEARINGS ON,

37:03.517 --> 37:05.206
AND THEN I'LL ACTUALLY START
PUTTING IT IN THE CASE.

37:05.206 --> 37:06.551
WE'LL HAVE A TRANSMISSION.

37:06.551 --> 37:07.896
I'VE BEEN HOLDING
ONTO THIS '39 3-SPEED

37:07.896 --> 37:09.206
JUST FOR THIS PROJECT,
SO WHEN RICHARD

37:09.206 --> 37:11.206
BOUGHT THE TRUCK,
I MADE THAT PART OF THE DEAL.

37:11.206 --> 37:13.103
DOES THIS TURN YOU ON?

37:13.103 --> 37:15.068
NO ONE MAKES REPLACEMENT PARTS
FOR THESE OLD TRANSMISSIONS,

37:15.068 --> 37:18.896
SO I'VE HAD TO CLEAN UP
ALL THE ORIGINAL PARTS.

37:18.896 --> 37:20.172
WHEN I BROKE THE TRANSMISSION
DOWN,

37:20.172 --> 37:22.000
I TOOK SOME PICTURES
WITH MY PHONE.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.241
I'M USING THOSE TO MAKE SURE

37:23.241 --> 37:24.586
I GET IT PUT BACK TOGETHER
JUST RIGHT.

37:24.586 --> 37:26.586
SO THAT GOES LIKE THAT.

37:26.586 --> 37:29.034
Mike:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:29.034 --> 37:32.448
TRYING TO PUT THE TRANSMISSION
BACK TOGETHER.

37:32.448 --> 37:33.724
TRYING TO PUT THE TRANSMISSION
BACK TOGETHER...

37:33.724 --> 37:35.000
YEAH, TRYING.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.310
...OR PUTTING THE TRANSMISSION
BACK TOGETHER?

37:36.310 --> 37:37.482
-WELL, A LITTLE OF BOTH.
-YOU KNOW HOW IT IS?

37:37.482 --> 37:39.896
I THINK SO.
I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

37:39.896 --> 37:42.655
-IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT...
-OH, WAIT.

37:42.655 --> 37:44.034
THERE IS A TUBE MISSING
RIGHT THERE, THOUGH.

37:44.034 --> 37:45.724
YEAH, THERE'S A WHOLE TUBE
MISSING.

37:45.724 --> 37:48.275
YEAH, I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE THAT.
I TOTALLY MISSED THAT.

37:48.275 --> 37:51.068
OKAY, WELL, I GOT TO GO FIND
ANOTHER CLUSTER GEAR NOW.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.344
WHERE WE GONNA
FIND THAT AT?

37:52.344 --> 37:53.758
YOU GOT ONE AT YOUR SHOP?
I BET YOU DO.

37:53.758 --> 37:55.000
I PROBABLY DO, YEAH.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.103
YOUR PILE OF JUNK.

37:57.103 --> 38:00.000
SEE, MY PILE OF JUNK
COMES IN HANDY, THOUGH.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.827
I'M NO MECHANIC, BUT YOU WOULD
THINK THAT SOMETHING

38:02.827 --> 38:04.379
THAT'S MISSING
A GIANT CHUNK OUT OF IT

38:04.379 --> 38:05.896
WOULD NOT BE GOOD
TO PUT BACK TOGETHER.

38:05.896 --> 38:07.103
IT'S PROBABLY BEEN
KIND OF NOISY,

38:07.103 --> 38:08.241
MISSING A TOOTH.

38:08.241 --> 38:09.310
-NOISY?
-YEAH.

38:09.310 --> 38:11.000
IF IT EVEN WORKED.IT WOULD WORK.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.448
IT WOULD JUST MAKE
A LOT OF NOISE.

38:12.448 --> 38:13.931
I'M SCARED IT'S EVEN
GONNA RUN NOW.

38:13.931 --> 38:15.344
GEEZ, LOUISE.

38:15.344 --> 38:16.931
Brian: WELL, THAT'S GONNA
SLOW ME DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

38:16.931 --> 38:18.448
I WAS JUST ABOUT READY TO PUT
THIS THING BACK TOGETHER,

38:18.448 --> 38:19.965
AND NOW I CAN'T.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.862
WELL, THE ONLY PLACE YOU'D GET
A CLUSTER GEAR

38:21.862 --> 38:23.000
FOR A '39 FORD TRANSMISSION

38:23.000 --> 38:24.655
IS FROM SOMEBODY
WHO HOARDS THAT CRAP.

38:24.655 --> 38:26.206
LUCKILY, I'M THAT GUY.

38:26.206 --> 38:28.758
I CAN'T GUARANTEE I'M GOING
TO ACTUALLY HAVE ONE.

38:28.758 --> 38:30.551
SO I GRAB JEREMY AND HEADED
TO MY SHOP.

38:30.551 --> 38:31.827
I FIGURE HE'S GOT A FRESH SET
OF EYES

38:31.827 --> 38:33.862
TO HELP ME SPOT
THE PART WE NEED.

38:33.862 --> 38:36.482
I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PROBLEMS
WE COULDN'T FORESEE.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.000
THERE ALWAYS ARE.
RIGHT.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.172
BESIDES, HE'S THE ONLY
THAT HASN'T BEEN TO MY PLACE

38:40.172 --> 38:41.793
AND DOESN'T GIVE ME
A HARD TIME ABOUT IT.

38:43.448 --> 38:45.379
DUDE.
I CAN TELL FROM HERE,

38:45.379 --> 38:47.275
THIS IS AS BAD
AS THEY SAID IT IS.

38:47.275 --> 38:50.896
THIS IS OLD STUFF
GALORE, MAN.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.689
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S AT?
-NO.

38:52.689 --> 38:55.172
IS THERE WHERE STEERING COLUMNS
GO TO DIE?

38:55.172 --> 38:56.344
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

38:56.344 --> 38:58.241
YOU HAVE, LIKE,
A WHOLE PLETHORA.

38:58.241 --> 38:59.448
HOLD ON.
THIS MIGHT BE IT.

38:59.448 --> 39:02.758
LET ME SEE
THE ONE YOU GOT.

39:02.758 --> 39:03.586
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

39:03.586 --> 39:04.724
Brian: SO THERE.

39:04.724 --> 39:06.655
MY STASH OF PARTS
JUST SAVED ME A TON TIME.

39:06.655 --> 39:08.275
YOU MIGHT THING THIS IS, LIKE,
A DIRTY SHOP,

39:08.275 --> 39:10.000
BUT IT JUST SAVED OUR ASS.

39:13.379 --> 39:14.862
Jason: LOOK WHAT I GOT.

39:14.862 --> 39:16.103
IS THAT
THE MYSTERIOUS ENGINE?

39:16.103 --> 39:17.448
THAT'S
THE MYSTERIOUS ENGINE.

39:17.448 --> 39:20.137
THIS IS AS MUCH OF IT
AS I'VE SEEN, SO...

39:20.137 --> 39:21.413
-THE BOX?
-YEAH.

39:21.413 --> 39:23.241
-THIS JUST LOOKS LIKE A BOX.
-BIG MOMENT.

39:23.241 --> 39:25.000
Brian: WHILE JEREMY AND I
WERE AT MY SHOP,

39:25.000 --> 39:26.068
THE GUYS KEPT ON TRUCKING.

39:26.068 --> 39:27.310
MIKE GOT THE CHASSIS PAINTED,

39:27.310 --> 39:28.931
SO NOW JEREMY CAN WORK
ON THE PEDAL ASSEMBLY,

39:28.931 --> 39:30.724
AND THAT MEANS SOON WE'LL
STABBING THE MOTOR IN THE TRUCK.

39:30.724 --> 39:32.172
SMALL-BLOCK.

39:32.172 --> 39:34.896
HEY, IT LOOKS GOOD ALREADY.IT'S A FLATHEAD.

39:34.896 --> 39:36.275
Brian: WHEN RICHARD WAS TRYING
TO GET ME TO SELL

39:36.275 --> 39:38.517
THIS TRUCK TO HIM,
HE THREW IN A LITTLE SWEETENER.

39:38.517 --> 39:39.965
I'VE GOT AN H&H FLATHEAD,

39:39.965 --> 39:42.000
ALL BUILT IN THE BOX,
BRAND-NEW.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.827
THAT'D BOLT RIGHT IN THERE,
JUST ABOUT.

39:42.827 --> 39:43.896
LET'S DO IT.

39:43.896 --> 39:45.103
I FIGURED HIS FLATHEAD V-8

39:45.103 --> 39:47.620
WOULD BE THE PERFECT MOTOR
FOR THIS BUILD.

39:47.620 --> 39:49.068
LOOK AT THAT.

39:49.068 --> 39:51.344
SO HE DID ACTUALLY
HAVE AN ENGINE.

39:51.344 --> 39:52.827
-YEP.
-IT'S GOT COBWEBS ON IT.

39:52.827 --> 39:56.379
THAT'S GOT THREE CARBURETORS
ON IT, FIN HEADS.

39:56.379 --> 39:57.931
WAIT.
-OFFENHAUSER.

39:57.931 --> 39:59.551
THERE IS
A SLIGHT ISSUE HERE.

39:59.551 --> 40:01.344
THIS ISN'T GONNA BOLT
INTO OUR TRUCK THE WAY IT IS.

40:01.344 --> 40:02.620
OH.

40:02.620 --> 40:05.620
THIS IS
A LATE-MODEL FLATHEAD.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.103
YOU KNOW, LIKE, THEY CHANGED
THEM BETWEEN '48 AND '49.

40:07.103 --> 40:08.620
THIS IS
A '49 TO '53 FLATHEAD,

40:08.620 --> 40:10.172
AND THAT IS NOT
GONNA FIT THAT FRAME

40:10.172 --> 40:12.517
WITHOUT
CHANGING SOME STUFF.

40:12.517 --> 40:13.931
OUR INITIAL PLAN WAS TO TAKE IT
OUT OF THE BOX

40:13.931 --> 40:15.241
AND BOLT IT INTO THE TRUCK.

40:15.241 --> 40:16.827
THAT'S WHAT RICHARD SAID
WE COULD DO.

40:16.827 --> 40:18.241
YOU'RE TALKING CHANGING THE
MOTOR OR CHANGING THE CHASSIS?

40:18.241 --> 40:19.862
WE GOT TO TAKE THIS MOTOR
ALMOST COMPLETELY APART.

40:19.862 --> 40:21.965
ALL THIS FRONT STUFF
ON THE ENGINE

40:21.965 --> 40:23.862
IS NOT REALLY GONNA WORK
WITH WHAT WE GOT HERE.

40:23.862 --> 40:26.241
WE NEED TO GET WITH CHAD
TO GET IMMEDIATELY HERE

40:26.241 --> 40:27.896
WHAT NEED
FOR THIS TO CONVERT IT.

40:27.896 --> 40:29.965
-IT TOO LONG OR SOMETHING?
-YEAH, IT WON'T FIT.

40:29.965 --> 40:31.482
THE WAY
THE MOTOR MOUNTS ARE,

40:31.482 --> 40:33.103
THEY'RE FOR
A LATER-MODEL FRAME.

40:33.103 --> 40:35.172
Man #4: WHAT A SWEET,
READY-TO-GO ENGINE, RICHARD.

40:35.172 --> 40:36.827
YOU AND I HAVE TO GET A PARTS
LIST TOGETHER

40:36.827 --> 40:39.517
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING
TO SLOW US DOWN.

40:39.517 --> 40:41.068
Brian: SO MUCH FOR BEING AHEAD
OF SCHEDULE.

40:41.068 --> 40:43.517
NOW WE'RE GONNA LOSE A WHOLE
DAY MODIFYING THE MOTOR,

40:43.517 --> 40:45.586
NOT TO MENTION HUNTING
DOWN REPLACEMENT PARTS.

40:45.586 --> 40:46.793
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:46.793 --> 40:47.896
FOR ONCE, THIS ONE IS ON YOU,
RICHARD.

40:47.896 --> 40:49.620
LET'S GO, BASS.

40:53.241 --> 40:56.137
Narrator:
NEXT WEEK ON "FAST N' LOUD,"

40:56.137 --> 40:59.310
AS THE MONKEYS KEEP CRANKING
ON THE '33 FORD...

40:59.310 --> 41:00.586
UGH, I KNEW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

41:00.586 --> 41:02.689
...RICHARD PUTS THEIR FEET
TO THE FIRE.

41:02.689 --> 41:04.655
I'M REALLY, REALLY FREAKING
PRESSED FOR TIME.

41:04.655 --> 41:07.172
WE'RE THE LAST PEOPLE THAT WANT
TO BE TAKING IT BACK APART.

41:07.172 --> 41:10.103
Narrator: ...AND MAY CAUSE THEM
TO BURN OUT.

41:10.103 --> 41:11.413
STOP.

41:11.413 --> 41:12.655
Brian: I'VE SEEN LOTS OF WEIRD
STUFF ON THESE CARS,

41:12.655 --> 41:13.758
AND THIS ONE IS
KIND OF BLOWING MY MIND.

41:13.758 --> 41:20.931
Narrator:
THEN RICHARD GOES FOR THE GOLD

41:20.931 --> 41:22.862
IN THE MONSTER JAM
WORLD FINALS...

41:22.862 --> 41:25.206
