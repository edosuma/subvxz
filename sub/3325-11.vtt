00:02.044 --> 00:03.705
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:05.298 --> 00:06.253
What are you?

00:06.466 --> 00:08.172
The only person who can save your sister.

00:08.384 --> 00:09.715
Guardians, Scott.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.087
You help me catch her,

00:11.304 --> 00:14.467
I'll help you get
your mother and Stiles' father back.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.218
Scott, don't do this. Don't go with him.

00:16.893 --> 00:18.554
Derek, look at me.

00:26.611 --> 00:27.726
Derek?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.899
Derek, come on!

00:43.920 --> 00:45.535
- Where is she?
- Jennifer?

00:45.796 --> 00:47.536
- Gone, with Scott's mom.
- She took her?

00:47.757 --> 00:49.463
Yeah. If that's not enough
of a kick to the balls,

00:49.675 --> 00:51.085
Scott left with Deucalion, okay?

00:51.302 --> 00:53.258
So we gotta get you out of here.
The police are coming right now,

00:53.471 --> 00:55.803
- and we gotta get you the hell out of here.
- Whoa.

00:56.849 --> 00:57.964
What about Cora?

01:02.271 --> 01:03.351
You see the twins?

01:04.023 --> 01:04.978
No.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.311
But I see the Argents.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.938
- What is it?
- A retreat.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.699
Not to bring up uncomfortable memories,

01:16.911 --> 01:18.572
wasn't the last time you saw them

01:18.913 --> 01:21.996
the time you killed Kate and then
they burned you alive? Hmm?

01:26.087 --> 01:27.327
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

01:27.547 --> 01:29.162
Scott and Stiles went back
for Derek and Jennifer.

01:29.382 --> 01:31.043
I had to get Cora out.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.174
Where are Scott and Stiles?

01:38.391 --> 01:39.756
Stiles is still at the hospital.

01:39.976 --> 01:41.967
He's gonna hold off the cops for us.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.224
We have to go right now.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.973
What about Scott and Melissa?

01:46.691 --> 01:48.397
Jennifer took Melissa.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.946
What about Scott?

01:57.159 --> 01:58.319
Derek, where's Scott?

02:13.759 --> 02:15.135
Just perfect.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.558
A Stilinski at the center of this whole mess.
What a shocker.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.806
Think you can answer some questions
without the usual level of sarcasm?

02:27.023 --> 02:29.685
If you can ask the questions
without the usual level of stupid.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.275
Where's your dad, and why has no one
been able to contact him?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.068
I don't know. I haven't seen him in hours.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.319
Is he drinking again?

02:38.284 --> 02:40.275
What do you mean "again"?
He never had to stop.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.655
But he did have to slow down.
Is he drinking like he used to?

02:42.872 --> 02:45.705
All right, how about this? Next time I see him,
I'll give him a field sobriety test, okay?

02:45.916 --> 02:48.407
We'll do the alphabet.
Start with F, end with U.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.165
How about you just tell me
what the hell happened here?

02:53.966 --> 02:57.458
I don't know what happened here.
l was stuck in the elevators the whole time.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.719
You're not the one
who put the name on the doors, are you?

03:03.392 --> 03:04.472
What name?

04:02.326 --> 04:04.237
- She's dying, isn't she?
- I don't know.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.952
So what are you gonna do?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.328
I don't know.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.296
Wanna figure something out?

04:17.508 --> 04:19.840
Because while Scott and
Stiles were out there

04:20.052 --> 04:21.588
trying to help people from being killed,

04:21.804 --> 04:22.964
you were in here

04:23.180 --> 04:25.671
rolling around
the sheets with the actual killer.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.391
Do you get how many people she's killed?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.562
Erica and Boyd are dead,
Cora is dying,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.810
and you are doing nothing!

04:37.737 --> 04:39.944
Why'd you do this to us, Derek?

04:40.865 --> 04:42.947
Was it all about the power?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.316
Were you bored?

04:50.374 --> 04:51.454
Were you lonely?

04:54.378 --> 04:55.493
Maybe.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.216
I told Cora I wouldn't leave.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.548
I'll help the others when I figure out
how to help her.

05:08.768 --> 05:10.508
There's no time!

05:15.274 --> 05:16.855
The full moon's coming.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.976
The sheriff and Melissa are gonna be dead,
so I'm gonna try and help them.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.903
You can sit here and perfect
the art of doing nothing.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.655
I wouldn't take it personally.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.328
Anger is just a tool.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.702
He's using it to excuse

05:34.919 --> 05:36.705
shifting allegiance

05:36.921 --> 05:38.502
from one Alpha to another.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.333
From you to Scott.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.050
Scott's not an Alpha yet.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.045
But he's on his way, isn't he?

05:45.054 --> 05:46.464
The word is "guardian," Allison.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.922
More than anyone, you know that's a role
I haven't exactly lived up to lately.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.007
But she took Scott's mother
and Stiles' father.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.347
- That's not a coincidence.
- Yeah, I'd also consider the fact that

05:54.563 --> 05:57.976
someone put your name up in large block
letters on the elevator doors.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.899
- That kind of felt like a warning to me.
- I think it might be Morrell.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.853
She knows a lot more than she lets on,
and she might even be trying to help us.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.189
Well, she needs to get
on that a lot faster, okay?

06:06.367 --> 06:09.655
Seeing as that the lunar eclipse
is less than two freaking nights away.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.782
Stiles, don't give up hope.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.539
- He could already be dead.
- I don't think so.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.332
There's something about Jennifer's tactics.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.290
It's like she's still positioning,
still moving pieces into place.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.499
And you're one of them.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.755
Then let's not wait around
to see her next move.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.793
Everything she's done has
been on a telluric current.

06:26.971 --> 06:30.338
So Melissa and the sheriff have to be
somewhere on one of those currents, right?

06:30.683 --> 06:33.891
Stiles, if we're gonna find them,
we need your help.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.397
So you seriously wanna go after her?

06:37.606 --> 06:39.312
I mean, what if she just takes
you like the others, huh?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.561
No offense, but what's
the difference between you and them?

06:43.362 --> 06:44.943
I'm carrying a .45.

06:46.365 --> 06:49.072
Maybe she can heal from a shot
to the leg and a few slashes to the face,

06:49.451 --> 06:52.318
but personally, I'd like to see how
she holds up with half her skull blown off.

06:53.122 --> 06:56.535
We've got one priority right now,
and that is to find Melissa and your dad.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.745
We've got a map and
every clue we need to figure this out.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.624
The only thing we don't have is time.
Which is why I need both of you.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.213
Where do we start?

07:12.433 --> 07:14.219
The place where
the sacrifices have been committed

07:14.435 --> 07:16.221
have usually been different from
where the bodies have been found.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.722
I think the placement has to do

07:17.938 --> 07:19.223
with the strength of the current.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.557
So there's the school,
the animal clinic, the bank.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.476
Wait a sec. She wouldn't use the
same place twice, would she?

07:25.696 --> 07:27.732
Only if she didn't succeed the first time.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.402
- Scott's boss.
- Deaton.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.533
It was her only failure.
That could mean something.

07:33.746 --> 07:36.362
That's just one place so far.
We're gonna need a lot more help.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.622
- What about Lydia?
- Lydia?

07:39.335 --> 07:40.324
What can she do?

07:40.544 --> 07:42.876
Uh, Lydia's got sort of a talent.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.209
She somehow ended up
finding a couple of the bodies, um,

07:46.425 --> 07:47.961
without actually looking for them.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.049
Well, what is she? Psychic?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.596
She's something.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.077
Careful.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.504
Don't worry.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.712
I know going too far could kill me.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.008
That's not exactly what I meant.

08:46.402 --> 08:47.562
Whoa.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.196
I thought you guys retired.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.243
Retired, yes. Defenseless, no.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.029
Now, make sure your phone's on.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.365
If you hear from Scott,
you let us know immediately.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.956
Yeah, I'm thinking
that's gonna be kind of unlikely.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.878
Both of you, try to remember
he's just doing what he thinks is right.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.710
I can't shoot a gun or use a crossbow, but...

09:15.973 --> 09:18.680
Well, I'm getting pretty good with these.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.304
I've heard
it's something only an Alpha can do.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.560
- And with good reason.
- Which is?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.276
You know normal wolves never abandon
an injured member of the pack.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.195
They care for it. They bring it food from a kill

09:34.408 --> 09:37.070
and then regurgitate it
into the mouth of the injured wolf.

09:37.286 --> 09:41.370
They even give it physical and emotional
comfort by intensely grooming it.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.369
In a way, they can do more
than just ease pain.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.292
They can be instrumental
in healing their own.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.917
If you're trying to tell me I can save her,
just tell me.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.669
I'm telling you

09:53.886 --> 09:56.172
- I've heard it's possible.
- How?

09:56.472 --> 09:59.885
It's that spark of power
that makes you an Alpha.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.510
When you take her pain,

10:01.685 --> 10:05.223
she draws on the power
that provides you with those special gifts.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.602
The power that heightens your senses,
your strength.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.773
The power that transforms your body.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.727
As an Alpha, you have that bit of extra,

10:14.198 --> 10:17.190
that spark
that intensifies the color of your eyes

10:17.409 --> 10:20.321
from a bright yellow into a searing red.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.361
- If I can save her...
- If.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.458
I didn't say it works every time.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.546
It could just as easily kill you.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.014
How do I do it?

10:45.354 --> 10:46.389
By taking her pain?

10:46.939 --> 10:48.270
And then some.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.019
Because there's a cost.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.027
Okay, sweetheart,
this is not a problem.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.730
Having gotten my share
of hickeys in high school,

10:57.950 --> 11:00.987
I developed some patented
cover-up methods.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.036
If you don't wanna go to school, honey,
you don't have to.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.739
That's not it.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.078
It's just...

11:10.045 --> 11:13.754
Someone tried to strangle me,
and I survived.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.921
I don't need to hide that.

11:20.806 --> 11:21.886
No.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.389
No, you don't.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.641
But we're still gonna do your hair, right?

11:29.857 --> 11:32.314
- Of course we are doing my hair.
- Perfect.

11:45.747 --> 11:46.827
It's empty.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.077
Be careful anyway.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.451
I thought you only
used those on werewolves.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.291
I do.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.590
What the hell are you doing?

12:03.140 --> 12:06.177
I'm sorry. But you're just
gonna have to trust me on this.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.976
I knew for a long time
she didn'tjust operate on the currents.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.265
She was in sync with them.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.753
Now, this is a sacrifice.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.352
I don't believe it.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.059
Scott can't really be with them. He can't be.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.198
Then what can I do?

13:05.410 --> 13:09.744
I mean, I get that I'm some kind of,
like, human Geiger counter for death.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.911
But I don't know
how to turn it on and off yet.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.834
All I know is that she tried
to kill me because of...

13:19.675 --> 13:21.165
Because of what?

13:22.094 --> 13:24.085
Hey, Lydia, what?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.215
When she called me a Banshee,

13:26.431 --> 13:28.171
she was surprised by it.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.392
What if that's not why she tried to kill me?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.477
Then why did she?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.400
That's what we need to find out.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.989
Why did he do that?

13:46.368 --> 13:47.448
I don't know.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.821
We need to go, okay? We need help.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.125
Allison?

13:59.047 --> 14:00.787
Allison, we have to go.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.380
They're all gonna die.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.846
Aren't they?

14:21.111 --> 14:23.648
I can understand
not seeing a downside to this,

14:23.864 --> 14:26.196
as you haven't
exactly been Alpha of the year,

14:26.408 --> 14:28.774
but think about what else you'll be losing.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.361
I don't care about power.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.996
Not anymore.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.119
What about the power to fight back?

14:37.377 --> 14:40.210
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but Kali's ultimatum still stands.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.037
The full moon is tomorrow night.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.838
And if you couldn't beat her as an Alpha,

14:44.009 --> 14:46.170
how do you think you're
gonna fare as a Beta?

14:47.596 --> 14:49.803
I don't care.

14:50.307 --> 14:54.391
What if this was exactly
what Jennifer was hoping for?

14:54.603 --> 14:57.640
She would know the only
way for you to save Cora

14:57.856 --> 14:58.971
would be giving up your power.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.056
Maybe that's what she
was gonna have you do at the hospital.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.189
Why?

15:02.402 --> 15:05.610
So that you wouldn't be able to face
the Alphas without her.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.195
She wants you to come to her.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.319
It's all part of her little seduction,

15:10.535 --> 15:13.197
and she is still seducing you.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.825
She needs you on her side.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.620
Aiden isn't texting me back.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.380
Okay, well, maybe we could just...
We could go over there and...

15:33.141 --> 15:34.096
What?

15:36.603 --> 15:39.094
Oh, God. What is it now?

15:39.481 --> 15:42.348
It's from Isaac.

15:43.735 --> 15:44.690
Jennifer, she...

15:45.028 --> 15:48.862
She has Allison's father. She took him.
She's got all three now.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.614
There's still time. We still have time, right?

15:58.375 --> 16:00.411
Stiles? You okay?

16:01.878 --> 16:04.415
What is it? What's wrong?

16:06.425 --> 16:07.505
Stiles.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.962
I think I'm having a panic attack.

16:20.397 --> 16:21.637
You okay over there?

16:25.694 --> 16:27.901
Chris? It's Chris, right?

16:28.280 --> 16:29.395
Yeah.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.199
Oh.

16:40.459 --> 16:43.417
Is it just me
or has somebody been here before?

16:43.628 --> 16:45.038
Years ago.

16:48.425 --> 16:52.259
Hate to disappoint you,
but we watched her take your ankle knife.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.380
And the knife that's in your sleeve.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.724
And the switchblade in your other sleeve.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.688
And the Taser in your jacket pocket.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.743
Argent.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.917
The French word for "silver."

17:34.012 --> 17:35.593
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.850
Interesting how truth
becomes altered by legend.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.855
When it's not actually
the metal silver that kills werewolves,

17:48.068 --> 17:49.604
but the family.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.355
What's the Argent Code again?

17:51.821 --> 17:53.777
"We hunt those who hunt us"?

17:55.492 --> 17:57.278
I hope you don't
mind if I borrow it for a little while,

17:57.494 --> 17:58.825
since I've been hunted myself.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.200
Don't pretend like
we have the same cause.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.155
I don't kill innocent people.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.248
That's why they call it a sacrifice.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.122
And I wish it worked another way.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.745
But think about what you're doing.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.459
You are making this town,

18:12.676 --> 18:15.383
even this world, safer for your children.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.133
Well,

18:22.269 --> 18:23.725
most of them.

18:28.692 --> 18:29.807
Okay.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.441
Come on. Come on.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.440
Just try and think about something else.
Anything else.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.616
- Like what?
- Uh, happy things.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.741
Good things. Uh, friends, family...

18:43.957 --> 18:47.199
I mean, not family.
Oh, God. Okay, uh...

18:47.419 --> 18:50.001
Just try and slow your breathing.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.840
I can't... I can't.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.249
Shh, shh. Stiles, look at me.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.425
Shh. Look at me.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.173
Shh. Stiles.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.290
Ooh.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.290
How'd you do that?

19:35.634 --> 19:37.124
I, uh...

19:38.720 --> 19:43.931
I read once that holding your
breath could stop a panic attack.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.390
So when I kissed you,

19:51.399 --> 19:52.980
you held your breath.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.522
I did?

19:57.822 --> 20:00.279
Yeah, you did.

20:07.415 --> 20:08.621
Thanks.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.249
It was really smart.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.510
I just...

20:20.470 --> 20:22.802
I don't know, I just read it somewhere.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.765
And if I was really smart,

20:27.936 --> 20:32.145
I would tell you to sign up for a few
sessions with the guidance counselor.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.486
Morrell.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.365
- Are you here for Ms. Morrell?
- No, I thought this was gym class.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.538
Sweetheart, we're not in the mood for funny.
Do you know where she is?

20:50.792 --> 20:52.953
If I did,
I wouldn't be waiting here for 20 minutes.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.751
So how about you two back out the door
and wait your turn.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.046
- We're not here for a session.
- Well, I am.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.249
And I've got some serious
issues to work on.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.460
Hey, wait, wait. You're Danielle.
You're Heather's best friend.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.295
I was Heather's best friend.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.426
We've been working
on that issue three times a week.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.224
Hold on. Did you say
Ms. Morrell was 20 minutes late?

21:10.437 --> 21:13.349
And I don't know why either.
She's always on time.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.186
l was seeing her
at the beginning of the semester.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.271
She was never late.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.353
Then she's not late, she's missing.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.655
What if we're not the only ones
who think she knows something?

21:24.451 --> 21:26.362
Then I wanna know what she knows.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.777
- What are you doing?
- Trying to find her.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.238
- Those files are private.
- Yeah, she's kind of right.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.748
- That one's yours.
- Let me see that.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.592
- Wait, Lydia, that's your drawing.
- Yeah, I know. It's a tree.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.261
- Yeah. It's good, too.
- Thank you.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.094
- No, but that's the same one, though.
- Same as what?

21:50.310 --> 21:52.050
It's the same one
I always see you drawing in class.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.261
It's a tree. I like drawing trees.

21:54.439 --> 21:57.522
No, but it's the exact same one.
Don't you see?

21:59.152 --> 22:00.312
Here, give me your bag.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.359
There, see?

22:21.424 --> 22:23.289
Okay, you can have my session.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.049
You've got bigger issues.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.384
What is this?

22:51.621 --> 22:53.236
I know where they are.

22:59.671 --> 23:02.458
It's the Nemeton. That's where
she's keeping them. It has to be.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.210
Stilinski!

23:04.425 --> 23:07.132
Ugh. All right, go to Derek, okay?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.256
He and Peter, they've been there before
so they'll know where it is.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.762
Tell them it's the root cellar, all right?
They'll know.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.181
Did you know
your dad's car is in the school parking lot

23:18.398 --> 23:19.854
and has been since last night?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.314
No. What does that mean?

23:23.194 --> 23:24.809
It means he's officially missing.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.731
Stiles, why am I getting the feeling

23:26.948 --> 23:29.815
you know something
that could help us find your dad?

23:31.119 --> 23:33.110
If I did, why would I not tell you?

23:33.830 --> 23:35.536
If it meant helping your dad,
why wouldn't you?

23:36.416 --> 23:39.374
So you're asking me
to tell you what I wouldn't not tell you?

23:40.211 --> 23:41.872
First, I have no idea what you just said.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.919
Second, how about you
just help me help you?

23:44.257 --> 23:46.293
Well, I don't know how to help you help me

23:46.467 --> 23:49.254
tell you something
that would help you if I don't know it.

23:49.512 --> 23:50.718
Are you doing this on purpose?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.216
I don't know anything, okay? Can Ijust go?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.924
- Where are your other friends?
- You mean Scott?

23:56.144 --> 23:59.477
I mean Scott,
I mean Isaac Lahey, Allison Argent,

23:59.689 --> 24:01.771
these twins, Ethan and Aiden.

24:01.983 --> 24:04.349
I've been told your whole little clique
didn't show up at school today.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.190
- I don't have a clique.
- Stiles, come on.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.397
There's been a pretty
disturbing amount of violent activity

24:10.617 --> 24:14.360
in this county in the last few months.
Several murders tied to this school.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.870
I don't know what's going on here,
but it's serious. And...

24:18.082 --> 24:19.288
Hey.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.002
Your dad is missing.

24:28.509 --> 24:29.760
Fine.

24:31.054 --> 24:34.467
But I don't want you going home alone.
You have someone you can stay with tonight?

24:34.766 --> 24:36.222
He's with me.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.141
You.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.900
Me.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.728
You.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.236
Me.

24:53.952 --> 24:56.364
Derek! We have a visitor.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.770
This way.

25:37.829 --> 25:38.909
It's a firefly.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.120
Unusual for this region.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.614
It's because of Jennifer, isn't it?

25:44.127 --> 25:47.210
Just before all this started,
a deer crashed into Lydia's car.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.788
The cats went crazy at the Animal Clinic.
Birds flew into the high school.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.669
It was all her.

25:51.884 --> 25:56.218
They say animals can sense natural
disasters when they're about to happen.

25:56.431 --> 25:59.468
Maybe they can
sense supernatural ones as well.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.096
Does she scare you?

26:03.521 --> 26:08.515
She concerns me if she's willing to kill
that many innocent people for her cause.

26:08.693 --> 26:11.355
People like your mother and Stiles' father.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.358
Are you willing to kill innocent people?

26:16.284 --> 26:19.697
I'll kill any living thing that gets in my way.

26:20.872 --> 26:23.454
You don't know where it is?
But Stiles said you'd been there.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.247
We have.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.296
But after a few memorable
experiences there,

26:29.505 --> 26:32.212
Talia, Derek's mother and my older sister,

26:32.425 --> 26:35.212
decided that she
didn't ever want us going back.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.009
She knew how dangerous it was,

26:37.221 --> 26:40.805
and took the memory
of its location from us.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.806
But then how are we supposed to find it?

27:41.702 --> 27:46.036
How did you know, Marin?
That we'd come for you?

27:46.332 --> 27:48.414
Because Jennifer and I are the same.

27:48.709 --> 27:52.873
And I know you've always
been suspicious of us, of what we can do.

27:53.089 --> 27:56.047
With good reason.
We know you sent that girl.

27:56.259 --> 27:57.999
The one who helped Isaac.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.422
Isaac! Get down!

28:02.598 --> 28:04.680
- What was her name?
- Braeden.

28:05.268 --> 28:09.261
And I sent her to do what I've always done,
maintain balance.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.436
What do you know about Jennifer?

28:11.691 --> 28:13.147
Nothing more than you know.

28:14.527 --> 28:18.691
This isn't you, Scott.
Go back to your friends.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.488
He can decide what's right for himself.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.942
Not without all the information.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.028
Have you told him everything you've done?

28:27.248 --> 28:30.331
How you've piled up bodies
in a narcissistically psychotic effort

28:30.543 --> 28:32.875
to form your perfect pack?

28:33.254 --> 28:36.371
Bodies that include Ennis, by the way.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.293
My brother saved him.

28:41.512 --> 28:44.549
He was alive when Deucalion
went in to see him.

28:44.807 --> 28:49.301
He wants you to go after Derek, Kali.
To force his decision.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.980
If Derek joins the pack,
it paves the way for Scott.

28:55.735 --> 28:59.694
The lies people will tell
when they're begging for their life.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.487
Ask him.

29:13.711 --> 29:15.326
Hey! Back off.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.301
I'm not going to let them kill you.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.136
But if you know something,
if you know where they are...

29:34.357 --> 29:38.646
The Nemeton.
You find that, you'll find Jennifer.

29:39.737 --> 29:42.854
Find the Nemeton.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.792
I don't wanna kill your
optimism or anything, but, you know,

29:56.003 --> 29:58.619
the both of us have been trying to do
the exact same thing for hours.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.416
You been tied up before?

30:01.592 --> 30:03.298
Many times.

30:03.511 --> 30:06.753
What, is that part
of being a werewolf hunter?

30:11.769 --> 30:14.306
I tried to download him
on as much as I could.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.763
Yeah, I was starting
to feel a little bit left out.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.559
You knew.

30:19.402 --> 30:22.269
I remember meeting you once
before you were sheriff.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.855
You questioned me about a body.
You knew something was up.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.616
You just weren't ready to believe it.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.577
You're right.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.365
There was a night, eight years ago.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.082
The night my wife died.

30:41.799 --> 30:45.291
I was at the end of a shift,
and a call came in.

30:46.554 --> 30:50.467
There'd been a pileup, and a young
woman, she was a teenager, actually,

30:50.891 --> 30:54.133
she was trapped under an overturned car.

30:54.437 --> 30:56.348
We had to wait for the paramedics.

30:57.231 --> 30:58.596
We were never getting her out.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.895
But I was able to hold her hand.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.356
She knew she was gonna die.

31:04.989 --> 31:07.571
Ijust kept telling her, "No, no. Listen...

31:08.909 --> 31:10.820
"The paramedics are on their way."

31:11.412 --> 31:13.368
And I remember

31:13.831 --> 31:16.868
her hand suddenly gripped
mine so tightly that I...

31:20.421 --> 31:22.958
I literally thought she
was gonna break the bones.

31:23.591 --> 31:26.549
And she looked me in the eye and she said,

31:28.179 --> 31:30.215
"If you wanna be with her,

31:31.474 --> 31:32.884
go now."

31:36.145 --> 31:38.636
And I knew she was
talking about my wife.

31:39.357 --> 31:41.348
But then that other part of my brain,

31:41.692 --> 31:43.808
the part that looks for clues,
for fingerprints,

31:43.986 --> 31:46.398
for logical connections, that part told me

31:46.614 --> 31:50.527
that there is no way that this girl
could possibly know about Claudia.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.363
And so I stayed.

31:54.705 --> 31:57.367
I stayed until the paramedics pulled her out.

32:01.045 --> 32:02.660
Till her heart stopped beating

32:03.756 --> 32:06.372
and they declared her dead.

32:07.301 --> 32:09.508
When I finally got to the hospital,

32:13.974 --> 32:16.181
I saw Stiles sitting in the waiting room,

32:17.395 --> 32:19.386
with his head in his hands.

32:21.399 --> 32:23.731
He was with Claudia when she died.

32:28.406 --> 32:29.771
But I wasn't.

32:34.412 --> 32:37.370
I wasn't with her because I didn't believe.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.492
I just did not believe.

32:43.796 --> 32:47.084
It has to be on a telluric current,
or maybe even at the axis of two,

32:47.299 --> 32:48.459
or where they all intersect.

32:48.676 --> 32:51.088
I just know it's where
Derek took Paige to die.

32:51.929 --> 32:53.260
My dad and Gerard were there once.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.214
But Gerard said it was years ago
and he couldn't remember where it was.

32:56.434 --> 32:59.050
And my dad
obviously isn't here to tell us now.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.638
Yeah, mine either.

33:00.855 --> 33:02.720
Then how do we find this place?

33:05.818 --> 33:08.025
There might be a way.

33:08.237 --> 33:09.818
But it's dangerous.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.610
We're gonna need Scott.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.166
How'd you guys find out?

33:21.667 --> 33:23.623
Lydia. You?

33:24.211 --> 33:27.920
Morrell. None of the other Alphas
know where it is either.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.422
So if this works,
are you gonna tell them?

33:31.427 --> 33:33.509
I can't stop Jennifer without them.

33:34.430 --> 33:37.467
How about we concentrate
on finding your parents first?

33:37.683 --> 33:38.889
What's the plan?

33:39.101 --> 33:41.092
Essentially, you, Allison and Stiles

33:41.312 --> 33:44.349
need to be surrogate sacrifices
for your parents.

33:45.316 --> 33:48.308
- We die for them?
- But he can bring us back.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.322
You can... You can bring us back, right?

33:52.531 --> 33:55.238
You remember the part
where I said it was dangerous?

33:55.451 --> 33:58.989
If it goes right, the three of you
will be dead for a few seconds.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.905
But there's something else
you need to think about.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.501
This is a dangerous thing
for more reasons than one.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.826
You'll be giving power back to the Nemeton,

34:07.046 --> 34:09.662
a place that hasn't had power
for a long time.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.540
This kind of power is like a magnet.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.046
It attracts the supernatural,

34:15.262 --> 34:17.924
the kind of things
that a family like the Argents

34:18.098 --> 34:20.384
can fill the pages of a bestiary with.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.592
It will draw them here,
like a beacon.

34:25.773 --> 34:29.607
It doesn't sound any worse
than anything we've already seen.

34:31.028 --> 34:33.110
You'd be surprised
at what you have yet to see.

34:35.658 --> 34:36.898
Is that it?

34:39.036 --> 34:40.196
No.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.370
It'll also have an effect on the three of you.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.698
You won't be able to see it,

34:45.918 --> 34:49.957
but you'll feel it every day
for the rest of your lives.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.958
It'll be a kind of

34:53.259 --> 34:55.250
a darkness around your heart.

34:55.803 --> 34:58.761
And permanent, like a scar.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.131
Like a tattoo.

35:08.399 --> 35:10.481
- What is that?
- Ultrasonic emitter.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.316
A smaller version
of what we use to corral werewolves.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.646
Only they hear it. Most of the time
we use it to push them away.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.360
Let's see if it works to attract them.

35:32.673 --> 35:35.005
It's gotta be now. I don't have a choice.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.585
You always have a choice.

35:36.885 --> 35:41.470
It's whether or not you can live with
the consequences, facing Kali as a Beta.

35:41.682 --> 35:45.891
Yeah, but it's notjust a full moon coming.
It's a lunar eclipse.

35:46.437 --> 35:47.927
We'll all be powerless.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.528
All right.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.772
What did you bring?

36:02.578 --> 36:04.443
Um, I got my dad's badge.

36:05.164 --> 36:09.578
Jennifer kind of crushed it in her hand,
so I tried hammering it out a bit.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.001
Still doesn't look great. Um...

36:13.213 --> 36:15.374
It doesn't need to look good
if it has meaning.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.335
Is that an actual silver bullet?

36:21.972 --> 36:24.349
Yeah, my dad made it
as kind of a ceremonial thing.

36:24.558 --> 36:27.049
When one of us finishes
learning all the skills to be a hunter,

36:27.227 --> 36:29.934
we forge a silver
bullet as a testament to the Code.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.147
Scott?

36:36.320 --> 36:39.187
My dad got my mom this watch
when she first got hired at the hospital.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.943
She used to say it was the only thing
in her marriage that ever worked.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.780
Okay. The three of you will get in.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.948
Each of us will hold you down
until you're essentially,

36:50.167 --> 36:51.828
well, dead.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.161
But it's notjust someone
to hold you under.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.671
It needs to be someone
who can pull you back.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.420
Someone that has
a strong connection to you,

37:01.428 --> 37:03.293
a kind of emotional tether.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.093
Lydia.

37:08.769 --> 37:09.975
You go with Stiles.

37:17.319 --> 37:19.901
Are you sure?
I mean, Scott and I both have to go under.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.989
It's okay.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.691
By the way,

38:46.992 --> 38:50.450
if I don't make it back and you do,
you should probably know something.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.654
Your dad's in town.
