00:13.081 --> 00:15.716
So, this is the most recent
photo of Grace?

00:15.816 --> 00:17.751
Yeah, that, uh...

00:17.851 --> 00:20.621
It's from her birthday. February.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.557
It's unlike her to
not return my calls.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.959
We're not as close
as we used to be.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.829
Once she moved down here,
we didn't talk as much,

00:28.929 --> 00:32.466
but-but even at her busiest,
she always gets back to me.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.902
You say it's been a week
since you last heard from her?

00:35.002 --> 00:39.039
Yeah. She mentioned
something about an audition,

00:39.140 --> 00:41.041
and then radio silence.

00:42.743 --> 00:43.444
Hey, babe.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.912
Did we wake you?

00:45.012 --> 00:47.848
Uh, no. Uh, Vivie's fussing.
It's feeding time.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.483
Nichelle, this
is Danny Wright.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.984
My old Marine
squad leader.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.021
Ah, I'm sorry for
dropping in like this. No.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.689
Hondo told me
your daughter is missing?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.325
I can't imagine
how you're feeling right now.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.760
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's been tough.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.962
We're just game-planning
for tomorrow.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.431
Well, I won't keep you.

01:03.531 --> 01:06.334
I just wanted to say hello
and I wish you luck

01:06.434 --> 01:08.702
on finding her.
Thank you.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.440
She's a sweetheart.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.042
You're a lucky man.
I don't know
how lucky I am

01:15.143 --> 01:17.178
with your ugly mug
standing in front of me.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.913
My face is ten times better
than that thing

01:20.013 --> 01:21.682
you have to look at
in the mirror every morning.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.152
Light chocolate
versus dark chocolate.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.121
I mean it, though.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.689
You've got
Nichelle and...

01:28.789 --> 01:31.659
your little girl here, safe,

01:31.759 --> 01:34.162
in your beautiful home...

01:34.262 --> 01:36.397
Please, appreciate that.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.733
If I'd known I was gonna
lose my wife Cassie...

01:40.834 --> 01:42.236
...and now Grace...
Hey, hey.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.505
Hold on, don't start talking
about Grace like she's gone.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.774
I've already checked with
the LAPD Missing Persons Unit.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.676
First thing tomorrow,
we're gonna set an alert

01:48.776 --> 01:50.244
on Grace's cell phone
and bank accounts.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.246
And that's just
the beginning.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.747
We're gonna find her, Danny.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.416
I need you
to believe that, too.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.218
And once we get things
squared away,

01:57.318 --> 01:58.719
we'll check with
Grace's friends

01:58.819 --> 02:01.289
and coworkers,
see what they tell us.
Okay. Yeah.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.090
Okay.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.725
Oh, uh...

02:04.825 --> 02:06.560
She was also,
she was seeing somebody.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.095
Uh, like-like a boyfriend.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.764
You got a name?
No, no.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.132
I'm guessing
that he wasn't the type

02:12.233 --> 02:13.667
that you, you bring home.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.469
She would get embarrassed
every time I brought him up.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.104
But you think she's been
seeing him a while?

02:17.205 --> 02:18.539
Couple months?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.773
All right, then we go
to Grace's apartment.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.041
See what we can
dig up on him.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.245
In the meantime,
we need some sleep, man.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.846
Fresh blankets on the couch.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.449
You let me know if
you need anything else.
Mm. Mm-hmm.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.251
Hondo...

02:30.351 --> 02:32.320
I really appreciate everything
you're doing for me.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.487
Everything
we've been through,

02:33.587 --> 02:35.989
least I can do.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.492
I'll see you at 0600.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.110
Oh, that's all right, Tammi.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.980
You can't control
the traffic on the 405.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.850
I'll keep the muffins warm
until you get here.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.390
Take us to
your safe. Now.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.425
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.626
Fine.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.161
We'll do it the hard way.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.466
Search every room. Ah.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.701
TAMMI
Hello? Aunt Patty?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.971
Found it! In here.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.174
Open it.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.811
Open it now or we go
after your grandkids.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.247
How would you even...

03:33.347 --> 03:34.682
We found your house,
didn't we?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.884
And it's either you,
or you and your grandkiddies.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.118
Take your pick.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.764
Bingo.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.434
See?
This could've been easy.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.668
Oh, well.
Come on, Ty.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.504
Do we have to--
Shut up!

03:56.604 --> 03:58.572
This is how we work.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.308
No witnesses.

04:00.408 --> 04:03.477
And since you just had
to tell her my name... Wait.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.245
I-I won't tell anyone.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.284
Ms. Clark?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.819
Orsan Security.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.287
We got an alert from your home
emergency bracelet.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.922
Please!

04:20.260 --> 04:21.995
Love you, too, babe.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.031
Yeah, best latte on
the Westside.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.733
Thanks, Street.
Don't worry.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.335
I got your boring
black coffee, too.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.836
Why mess with a classic?

04:28.936 --> 04:30.604
DISPATCHER
All units, shots fired at

04:30.704 --> 04:33.173
at 300 block at Tabor Avenue.
That's less than
three blocks away.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.976
I knew I should've
chugged a Red Bull.
22-David to Command.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.811
I'm with 25, 26-David,
in the area.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.279
Show us responding.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.421
26-David,

04:47.521 --> 04:49.423
one male down near
the front entry.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.958
Unresponsive.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.617
Got a female down.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.387
Ma'am, can you hear me?

05:19.487 --> 05:21.321
Rest of the house is clear.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.790
No sign of the shooters.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.791
She's unconscious,
but breathing.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.025
Needs a hospital
real bad.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.694
22-David,
suspects in the wind.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.696
Requesting an R/A for
the second victim.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.664
GSW to the chest.
Have them respond Code 3.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.965
The safe's open.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.267
There's no way to tell
if anything was taken.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.669
So, someone broke in

05:35.769 --> 05:37.337
just to shoot a grandmother
in cold blood?

05:43.310 --> 05:44.478
Excuse me.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.380
I'm looking for my aunt.
This is her house.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.216
Please.
You're related to
Patricia Clark?

05:49.316 --> 05:50.751
I'm her niece, Tammi.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.486
I was on the phone with her
when I heard a huge crash,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.187
then shouting.
What happened?
Someone broke in.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.956
She was shot and unconscious
when we found her.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.058
She's headed to the
hospital right now.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.193
I know this seems sudden,
but is there any reason

06:00.293 --> 06:02.229
someone might
target your aunt?
Target?

06:02.329 --> 06:03.531
No.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.365
She's the sweetest woman
in the world.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.768
She's basically
my second mom.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.102
I was on my way here.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.738
I just called to tell her
I was running late.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.239
If I'd gotten here sooner,
maybe I could've helped...

06:12.339 --> 06:14.074
No, you being here wouldn't
have stopped those jerks

06:14.174 --> 06:15.743
that did this.
Yeah, blaming yourself is

06:15.843 --> 06:16.977
the last thing your aunt would
want you to do.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.446
If she's gonna
pull through this,

06:18.546 --> 06:20.213
she'll need you by her side.
Trust me on this one.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.150
Come on. We'll get Patrol to
escort you to the hospital.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.352
Yeah, I got it.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.721
What a mess.
So the homeowner,

06:27.821 --> 06:29.289
Patricia Clark,
she was in rough shape

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
when the EMTs arrived.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.492
She's on her way
to the hospital.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.793
Just got word,
the security guard

06:32.893 --> 06:34.962
who responded to the call,
he didn't make it.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.930
Patrol is canvassing
for witnesses.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.266
All right, I just talked to
Detective Burrows at RHD.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.834
This is the third
violent home invasion

06:40.934 --> 06:41.969
targeting elderly Angelenos

06:42.069 --> 06:43.236
in the last
48 hours.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.172
Now, it looks like
a robbery crew,

06:45.272 --> 06:46.740
but RHD's having trouble
determining what,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.509
if anything, was taken.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.478
Nobody's reporting
anything missing?
Well, the victims are dead.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.246
There's no one left alive
to do the reporting.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.715
I mean, counting
the security guard,

06:54.815 --> 06:56.349
they've murdered
three people already.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.285
Four, if Patricia Clark
doesn't make it out of surgery.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.621
Is there any connection
between the victims?
Nothing concrete,

07:00.721 --> 07:01.855
other than the victims' ages.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.290
All were over 65.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.693
So, we've got a robbery crew
targeting grandparents.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.227
Yeah.
That's vile.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.929
Yeah, with no clear connection
between the victims,

07:09.029 --> 07:10.464
there's no reason to believe
these guys are done.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.800
LAPD doesn't have the resources
to protect every single

07:12.900 --> 07:15.068
elderly Angeleno
in the city. No.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.870
And that's why I'm putting
SWAT on high alert.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.539
If and when these guys
strike again,

07:18.639 --> 07:21.241
I want us ready to pounce.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.513
Sir.
Nothing close to an ID

07:59.613 --> 08:00.714
on our suspects yet,

08:00.814 --> 08:02.683
but witnesses saw
a black pickup

08:02.783 --> 08:04.885
with a broken taillight
fleeing Patricia Clark's street.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.587
Already got a BOLO out.
All right, good.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.188
If it pings,
SWAT rolls on it.

08:08.288 --> 08:11.324
Any luck uncovering a connection
between our three victims?

08:11.424 --> 08:12.760
There's got to be something.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.361
Same pool cleaner,
same handyman, gardener...

08:14.461 --> 08:16.063
So far, just that
they were all

08:16.163 --> 08:17.497
beloved parents
and grandparents.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.568
Patricia Clark,
James Day, Jerry Haverford.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.403
15 kids and grandkids
between them.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.838
Well, families got
to be devastated.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.306
I mean, there's got
to be a reason

08:26.406 --> 08:28.041
these folks were attacked
in their homes.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.477
Most likely explanation is
they were easy targets--

08:30.578 --> 08:31.645
less likely to fight back,

08:31.745 --> 08:33.080
easier to beat
if they did.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.615
We checked in
with the victims' families.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.283
None were
especially wealthy.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.051
All were comfortable,
but not rich.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.187
We can't rule out money
as a motive, though.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.388
Jerry Haverford

08:41.488 --> 08:43.023
was skeptical
of the stock market,

08:43.123 --> 08:44.324
and made more than a few

08:44.424 --> 08:46.093
social media posts
about banks being

08:46.193 --> 08:47.728
a poor hedge
against inflation.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.864
Patricia Clark and James Day
were both described as being

08:50.964 --> 08:53.200
extremely protective
of their money.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.201
Well, how protective
are we talking?

08:54.301 --> 08:55.535
I mean, I had an uncle

08:55.636 --> 08:57.437
who used to stuff cash
in his mattress

08:57.537 --> 08:58.906
because he was paranoid
about his savings.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.341
Early indications say
our victims might've had

09:01.441 --> 09:02.776
similar attitudes.
All right.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.545
So it could be these
three were storing up

09:05.646 --> 09:07.147
whatever they had
in their homes.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.281
All right, look into
their financials

09:08.381 --> 09:09.850
and see what you find.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.119
I want answers before
more grandparents are killed.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.467
This is where
Grace was living?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.236
Yeah, I guess so.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.976
This way.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.446
Whew.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.014
You'd never know
a place like this has

09:41.114 --> 09:43.651
a building manager
on site.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.886
Grace must've been struggling
more than she let on.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.921
Yeah. Yeah.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.024
2C, yeah, this is her.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.070
Grace?
You here?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.315
Looks like she hasn't
been home in a while.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.984
Yeah.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.333
Danny.
Yeah.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.567
What do you got?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.837
This the boyfriend?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.706
I don't know.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.308
She never sent me
photos of him.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.712
What are those?
You don't want to
see 'em, man.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.360
Sorry, I was
looking for Grace...

11:00.460 --> 11:02.162
Hey,
uh, so are we.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.097
I'm Sergeant
Harrelson, LAPD.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.833
This is Grace's father.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.367
You're a friend
of hers, Ms...

11:07.467 --> 11:08.802
Uh, yeah, Taylor.
I'm her neighbor.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.670
I just heard
her door open.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.939
I wanted to bring these by.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.640
They were delivered
the other day.

11:13.741 --> 11:14.641
When was the last time
you saw or spoke to Grace?

11:14.742 --> 11:15.642
Um...

11:15.743 --> 11:17.878
Like about a week ago?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.512
Did something happened to her?

11:19.612 --> 11:21.681
We're not sure.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.350
How was she the
last time you saw her?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.352
No, I didn't see her, I...

11:25.452 --> 11:27.020
I heard her.
Through the wall.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.756
She was arguing
with her boyfriend again.

11:28.856 --> 11:32.492
Again?
They fought a lot?

11:33.761 --> 11:36.196
Did those arguments
ever get violent?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.031
Anything you can tell us
is helpful, please.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.768
Uh, sometimes I,
I saw her with bruises

11:40.868 --> 11:42.836
on her arms and on her neck.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.171
She'd brush it off
when I would ask.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.539
She never told me
where they came from, but...

11:46.639 --> 11:48.641
You think the bruises
came from the boyfriend.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.145
Is this him?
Mm-hmm.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.914
Yeah.
You know his name?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.850
Uh, Peter... something.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.918
I think Grace
might've been tagged

11:58.018 --> 11:59.286
in a couple photos on Insta.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.022
Ah. Her profile is private.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.623
She blocked me
a couple of years ago,

12:03.723 --> 12:04.925
said that she didn't
want me spying on her.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.159
Well, let me go grab my phone.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.660
I can probably
find them for you.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.229
We'd appreciate that. Yeah.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.670
I'm gonna be
straight with you, Danny.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.140
I don't like the way
this is trending.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.308
In my experience,

12:21.408 --> 12:23.510
situations like this...

12:23.610 --> 12:25.012
they don't end well.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.382
Things were
so much easier

12:29.482 --> 12:31.284
when they were younger.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.485
I don't know.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.187
I knew how to be
there for her,

12:34.287 --> 12:35.622
how to keep her safe.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.024
But then, they get older.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.792
It's hard to sleep at night
when you know

12:38.892 --> 12:40.794
your daughter is out
in the big world without you.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.329
Yeah, I'd heard that
a few times before.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.264
I never understood it
until I had my own baby.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.465
When Cassie died,

12:45.565 --> 12:48.101
Gracie started to pull away.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.038
I thought that moving
somewhere remote like Montana

12:51.138 --> 12:53.841
would reconnect us,
but it just got worse.

12:53.941 --> 12:57.344
I tried to do
all the right things, but, uh...

12:57.444 --> 12:59.212
I still ended up
pushing her away.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.982
So, according to Insta,
his name is Peter Foster.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.884
May I?
Yeah.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.628
Hey.
Yo, Street,

13:15.728 --> 13:18.832
I need you to run
a search on Peter Foster.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.602
Okay, thanks.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.238
News about Patricia Clark?

13:25.338 --> 13:28.175
Yeah, she's still in surgery.
Going on four hours now.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.776
You seemed a little
shell-shocked earlier

13:29.877 --> 13:31.211
when we found her.
Are you good?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.346
Patricia reminds me a lot of
my Aunt Noreen.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.016
She was the coolest aunt
you could ask for.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.450
Always slipping me
candy or cash

13:37.550 --> 13:38.685
when I was younger.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.020
Came to all my
basketball games,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.022
even gave me my
first taste of liquor

13:42.122 --> 13:44.657
when I was a teenager--
Johnnie Walker Blue. Whoa.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.659
That's the good stuff.
Tasted like

13:46.759 --> 13:48.061
licking a fireplace,
at the time.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.463
Well, point is,
she was an awesome woman,

13:50.563 --> 13:52.099
and I can't help but think

13:52.199 --> 13:54.434
how terrified she'd have been
in Patricia's shoes today.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.770
Makes me really want to put
cuffs on whoever's responsible.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.239
Hey, wait.
I think I found something.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.875
All the victims had safes
inside their home, right?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.610
Different models and sizes,
but they all had

14:03.710 --> 14:05.578
the same sticker
on the inside of the door.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.779
Looks like a vendor sticker.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.183
Sanderson Safes Locksmithing.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.885
A home security shop
in the Valley.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.354
Owner is an Adam Sanderson.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.056
He's got a B charge
from 12 years ago.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.657
You think he got back into
the burglary business?

14:17.757 --> 14:19.026
Let's bring him in
and find out.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.267
Hey, Danny.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.701
It's Nichelle.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.104
All right.
I'll be in the car.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.474
Hey, baby.
Everything all right?

14:34.574 --> 14:38.811
Yeah, I just wish there was more
I can do for you and Danny.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.480
How's the search going?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.215
We just found out that Grace's
boyfriend has a misdemeanor

14:42.315 --> 14:43.750
for domestic battery
in his past.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.718
You pair that with
a neighbor who says

14:45.818 --> 14:47.154
she saw Grace with bruises
on her body,

14:47.254 --> 14:48.655
it's not looking
very good right now.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.091
Hmm.
How's Danny handling it?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.760
He's holding up.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.295
I just worry for him.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.330
Best case scenario, Grace
and her boyfriend left town

14:57.430 --> 14:59.599
for a couple of days and just
didn't tell anybody, but...

14:59.699 --> 15:01.401
But you're expecting the worst.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.436
Baby, I just want
to find him some answers.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.073
I can't help but put myself
in his shoes.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.540
If it was Vivienne
who was missing,

15:07.640 --> 15:08.875
I would never stop looking.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.478
You've got to keep the faith
for Danny.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.213
If anybody can find Grace,

15:13.313 --> 15:14.681
it's you, Hondo.

15:14.781 --> 15:15.748
Yeah.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.418
Baby, I got to go.
I love you.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.653
Kiss Vivienne for me, okay?
I will.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.289
Love you, too.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.197
Hey, listen.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.132
When we get to Peter Foster's,
I need you to let me

15:32.232 --> 15:33.967
handle it, all right?
Wait, what?

15:34.067 --> 15:36.603
No, just-- Give me five
minutes alone with him. Hey.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.871
I know you're pissed at him.
So am I.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.108
But we don't have proof
that he hurt Grace yet.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.377
Not enough proof?
Those photos weren't enough?

15:44.477 --> 15:45.945
Or the neighbor's story?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.914
He beat her, man.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.083
What more do you need?
Promise me

15:50.183 --> 15:52.285
you'll wait in the car.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.454
Okay.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.389
Let's find this bastard.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.526
I don't know anything
about any home robberies.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.129
Sanderson Safes Locksmithing
is on the up-and-up.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.530
Okay,
then why is your company

16:03.630 --> 16:05.432
the only connection
between the victims of

16:05.532 --> 16:06.666
three home invasions?

16:06.766 --> 16:09.069
Two of whom were
executed in their homes.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.503
Executed?

16:10.603 --> 16:11.871
Yeah.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.574
Whoa, you got
the wrong idea about me.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.808
Do we?

16:15.908 --> 16:17.077
Your record says
that you aren't shy

16:17.177 --> 16:18.611
about breaking and entering.

16:18.711 --> 16:19.679
Also says you broke into a safe

16:19.779 --> 16:20.847
at Racine Bank in 2011.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.449
Robbed it.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.883
Okay, I broke into the safe,

16:23.983 --> 16:25.818
but I didn't steal anything.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.754
The company that
manufactured the safe

16:27.854 --> 16:29.156
said it couldn't
be cracked.

16:29.256 --> 16:32.259
So, you broke into
a federal bank to prove a point?

16:32.359 --> 16:33.560
Pretty much.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.462
I had a knack for
those kind of things.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.663
My brother
taught me

16:36.763 --> 16:37.930
how to pick locks
when I was five,

16:38.031 --> 16:39.966
and I had some
rebellious teenage years

16:40.067 --> 16:42.869
where I took the word "don't"
as a personal challenge.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.572
I have a lot of
stuff I regret,

16:45.672 --> 16:47.140
but I never hurt anyone.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.309
That's your story...
but right now,

16:49.409 --> 16:52.079
you're the only one connecting
all three of our victims.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.314
Jerry Haverford,
James Day--

16:54.414 --> 16:56.083
And
Patricia Clark.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.718
I know all of them.
They-they bought safes from me.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.521
Patricia made me the most
amazing blueberry muffins

17:01.621 --> 17:02.722
when I did the install.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.424
Real sweetheart.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.259
Wait a second.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.395
All these clients
were referrals.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.362
Referrals from who?

17:09.462 --> 17:10.763
A guy named...

17:10.863 --> 17:12.432
Chauncey Telluride.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.202
He's a precious metals
dealer over in Van Nuys.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.437
He's referred
over a dozen clients to me

17:17.537 --> 17:18.805
in the past year or so.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.273
Okay, we need to talk
to this Telluride guy.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.075
And we need a copy of
that referral list.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.476
If the first three victims
were all on it...

17:23.576 --> 17:26.079
Anyone else on the list
could be a target.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.947
These are the people
referred to

17:28.047 --> 17:29.716
Sanderson Safes by
Chauncey Telluride.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.618
16 total.
Drops to 13

17:31.718 --> 17:34.321
if you exclude Patricia,
James Day, and Jerry Haverford,

17:34.421 --> 17:35.855
who were
already targeted.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.357
How many of the
remaining are over 60?

17:37.457 --> 17:40.460
Four. One in Encino,
two in Bel Air,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.061
one in Kagel Canyon.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.730
All right, let's get Patrol
to post units on their homes.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.064
In the meantime,
I want to talk to

17:45.165 --> 17:47.600
this Chauncey Telluride.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.068
Ping
on the BOLO.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.970
Red light camera spotted
the suspects' pickup truck

17:51.070 --> 17:52.705
near the 210 and Osborne Street.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.107
That's only a mile
from Kagel Canyon.
They're going after

17:54.207 --> 17:55.408
another one of
Telluride's clients.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.409
Get moving.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.683
Deacon, shots fired.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.118
We got an armed suspect.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.354
He's making a run for it
out the two side.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.556
Street, Powell, Stevens,
hunt that rabbit.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.192
Tan, Luca, you're with me
on the one side.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.034
LAPD.
Drop your weapon.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.770
I'm not the bad guy.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.506
Put it down, now. Now!

18:29.342 --> 18:30.577
Are you the homeowner?
Yeah.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.512
Three guys broke in
and robbed me.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.014
I got the drop on one of them,
and shot him in the leg.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.416
Clear!
What about the other two?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.218
They took off.
Check the perimeter.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.087
Two suspects unaccounted for.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.058
No other exits.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.628
He's got to be in there.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.200
This is the LAPD.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.801
Come out with
your hands up!

18:54.901 --> 18:56.369
Stinger.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.547
On your stomach!

19:07.647 --> 19:09.982
Hands behind your back.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.984
What the hell was that?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.520
Those little rubber
pellets hurt, huh?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.755
Try complying next time.
28-David.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.590
One suspect in custody.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.025
LUCA
No sign of
the other two suspects

19:19.125 --> 19:20.293
or the vehicle.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.628
They must've fled
before we got here.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.363
30-David.
Two armed suspects in the wind.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.097
They got away
with everything I had.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.566
Maybe not.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.203
Found this
on the suspect we nabbed.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.939
Gold coins?

19:33.039 --> 19:35.007
Well, they sure as hell
ain't chocolate.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.343
Well, at least we know
which precious metal

19:36.443 --> 19:38.010
Chauncey Telluride is dealing.

19:43.816 --> 19:44.884
The suspect we captured is
Benjamin Hayes.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.886
Record for
aggravated assault, fraud,

19:46.986 --> 19:49.088
possession...
You name it, he's done it.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
Let me guess-- not talking?
Bingo.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.460
We're looking through his known
associates to see if we can ID

19:53.560 --> 19:56.563
the two missing suspects,
but we haven't gotten a hit yet.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.198
We found that
when we arrested Hayes.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.200
The other suspects got away
with three more pouches

20:01.301 --> 20:04.671
just like it, each packed
with 20-gram gold coins.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.606
Judging by the weight--
if my math is right--

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
there's almost 40 grand
in this pouch alone.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.944
All told, they stole
over $100,000 in gold

20:12.044 --> 20:13.346
from the victim,
Todd Haley.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.081
Got something.

20:15.181 --> 20:19.218
Haley purchased his gold from
Southland Gold Depository,

20:19.319 --> 20:21.588
the precious metals company
owned by Chauncey Telluride.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.223
Turns out all four
robbery victims purchased

20:24.324 --> 20:27.794
sizable quantities of gold from
Telluride within the last year.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.396
Think we found that connection
we're looking for.

20:29.496 --> 20:32.265
Telluride's being brought to
interrogation as we speak.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.833
It's time to find out
why his customers have

20:33.933 --> 20:36.168
bull's-eyes on their backs.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.771
<i>I'm a gold broker--</i>

20:38.871 --> 20:40.973
I am not a killer.
Okay, then,

20:41.073 --> 20:42.742
how do you explain
why four of your clients were

20:42.842 --> 20:44.777
shot and robbed
in the last 48 hours?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.045
I don't know.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.714
I run a legit
precious metal business.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.716
Well, your "legit business"
markets almost exclusively

20:49.816 --> 20:51.150
to senior citizens--

20:51.250 --> 20:52.752
the same people who have
been hit in these robberies.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.253
So seems like you've got
a vested interest

20:54.354 --> 20:55.755
in targeting the elderly.
Only because

20:55.855 --> 20:57.256
they're more likely to buy gold,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.791
not because I want to kill them!

20:58.891 --> 21:00.427
Okay, you and your gold are
the only thing connecting

21:00.527 --> 21:02.729
multiple homicides
and these armed robberies.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.230
So either you're
lying to us,

21:04.331 --> 21:06.833
or someone else has access
to your company data.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.736
Jarvis...

21:09.836 --> 21:11.638
Come again?
My cousin, Jarvis.

21:11.738 --> 21:12.905
He got out of prison
a few months ago,

21:13.005 --> 21:14.941
he was having
a pretty rough go at it,

21:15.041 --> 21:16.443
so I gave him
a part-time job.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.944
Basic office scut work.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.579
He hated it,
he stopped showing up

21:19.679 --> 21:22.048
after a couple of weeks.
But get to the point, Chauncey.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.250
I didn't realize till later that
he stole one of my laptops.

21:24.351 --> 21:27.754
Does that laptop have
customer data on it?
Yes, names,

21:27.854 --> 21:29.489
addresses...
It had investment totals.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.524
Look, I figured he was just
gonna pawn it for quick cash,

21:31.624 --> 21:32.592
and so I didn't report it.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.726
I never thought that he would

21:33.826 --> 21:35.027
go after my customers.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.195
If these guys are picking
their targets

21:36.295 --> 21:37.430
from the customer data

21:37.530 --> 21:39.265
on the laptop,
any one of Chauncey's clients

21:39.366 --> 21:41.133
could be next.
Okay, we're gonna need
a copy of your company data,

21:41.233 --> 21:42.735
like, now.
Along with everything else

21:42.835 --> 21:45.638
you can tell us
about your cousin Jarvis.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.012
Peter Foster?

21:53.112 --> 21:54.581
Yeah.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.082
And you are?

21:58.317 --> 22:01.120
Sergeant Harrelson, LAPD.
I'm a friend of Grace Wright.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.622
Heard you two were
seeing each other.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.057
We broke up. Sorry.

22:07.293 --> 22:09.028
When was the last time
you saw her?

22:09.128 --> 22:11.364
Don't remember.
Really?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.165
Word on the street is you were
the last person to see her

22:13.265 --> 22:14.701
before she disappeared.
Doubt it.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.469
Look,
I've got things to do,

22:16.569 --> 22:18.838
so how about
you move your foot?

22:20.607 --> 22:22.642
Tell you what, Peter.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.144
I'm gonna need you to
very slowly lift up your shirt.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.679
Why? What for?

22:26.779 --> 22:30.450
To show me that 9mm you got
shoved in your waistband.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.023
So what?

22:37.123 --> 22:39.291
Ain't no law against it.
If you got
a permit for it,

22:39.392 --> 22:41.027
which would be
really hard to get

22:41.127 --> 22:42.895
with a record
like yours.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.170
Turn around,

22:51.270 --> 22:53.205
and walk back
towards me.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.178
Thanks.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.347
You know, taking a day off
usually implies

23:01.448 --> 23:03.015
not coming in to work. Hmm.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.216
When was the last time
either one of us had

23:04.316 --> 23:05.552
a real day off,
or a vacation?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.420
Thailand?

23:07.520 --> 23:10.056
Any luck finding
your friend's daughter?
Just picked up her boyfriend.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.758
About to
interrogate him now.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.392
Kid's got a history
of domestic abuse.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.127
Not that you need my help
leaning into him,

23:15.227 --> 23:17.396
but as a dad with two girls,
I'd be happy to.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.165
Hmm.
I got it, thanks.

23:19.265 --> 23:20.867
Besides, I hear you
got your hands full

23:20.967 --> 23:22.569
chasing down suspects
who are killing old folks?

23:22.669 --> 23:24.036
Yeah, it's a vile crew.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.772
They're executing the elderly
and stealing their gold.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.774
So much for looking
forward to retirement.

23:27.874 --> 23:28.908
You making headway?

23:29.008 --> 23:30.943
Maybe, but not soon enough.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.645
You need any help from me
at all, you let me know.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.046
Likewise.
All right.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.419
I don't know
what happened to Grace.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.455
One minute I was watching
<i>Planet Earth,</i>

23:42.555 --> 23:45.157
next minute you're dragging me
down here in handcuffs.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.759
Don't forget the bit
where you grabbed

23:46.859 --> 23:48.628
an unregistered firearm
before you answered the door.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.231
When was the last time
you saw or spoke to Grace?

23:52.331 --> 23:54.200
Not sure.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.102
Well, an eyewitness
says she heard you

23:56.202 --> 23:57.970
in a heated argument with Grace
in her apartment last week.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.506
Couples fight sometimes.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.873
Oh, so you're a couple now?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.274
I thought
you'd broken up.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.644
It was an
on-again, off-again thing.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.345
We weren't really
that serious.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.914
Well, that same eyewitness
said they saw Grace

24:08.014 --> 24:09.749
with bruises on her body
after you visited,

24:09.849 --> 24:13.152
multiple times.
Not my fault
she liked it rough.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.861
You pair those bruises with your
history of assault and battery,

24:21.961 --> 24:24.296
a clear story
starts to emerge...

24:24.396 --> 24:25.932
You want to know
what I think happened?

24:26.032 --> 24:27.266
I think Grace said
something you didn't like,

24:27.366 --> 24:28.868
something that enraged
you, so you hit her.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.369
But this time, it was
more than once or twice.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.104
This time it went way
beyond the bruises.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.740
So what'd you do
with her, Peter?

24:33.840 --> 24:36.008
Where is Grace now?

24:37.677 --> 24:39.145
I'm allowed a lawyer.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.446
Right?

24:51.290 --> 24:52.992
Wait, wait. What happened?

24:53.092 --> 24:55.161
You j--
you just stopped talking.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.864
He lawyered up, Danny.
I had no choice, I'm sorry.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.166
And I'm sorry you had
to hear all of that.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.002
Yeah, well, let-let me go
in there and speak to him.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.571
All right?
Just-just man to man.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.839
Please.
Even if I thought
that was a good idea,

25:06.939 --> 25:08.307
you know
I can't do that.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.309
All right.

25:10.409 --> 25:11.611
Okay.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.715
I'm gonna need some air.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.995
Chauncey Telluride's
sticky-fingered cousin

25:29.095 --> 25:30.563
is Jarvis Beckham.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.498
Has a rap sheet for
aggravated assault and robbery.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.100
Got released from Chino
three months ago.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.501
Prison
records show that

25:35.602 --> 25:37.336
he shared a cell there
with Benjamin Hayes,

25:37.436 --> 25:38.871
the suspect
we arrested earlier,

25:38.971 --> 25:41.307
as well as this guy--

25:42.074 --> 25:44.611
Ty Olson, who shares
their passion

25:44.711 --> 25:45.878
for armed robbery
and assault.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.346
Olson's definitely
the ringleader.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.481
As a teen, he nearly beat
his own grandfather

25:49.582 --> 25:52.384
to death with a hammer.
I'll have 50-Squad
clear their LKAs.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.220
Where are we
on the potential targets?

25:54.320 --> 25:55.922
Based on Telluride's
client data,

25:56.022 --> 25:57.890
there are six more
investors in L.A.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.291
who fit the profile.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.894
All are over age 60
and bought significant

26:01.994 --> 26:03.495
quantities of gold from
Telluride's company.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.232
We've got Patrol headed
to all six homes as we speak.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.300
Good. I had Telluride
advise his clients

26:08.400 --> 26:10.536
to move their gold
into safety deposit boxes

26:10.637 --> 26:12.138
as a precaution.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.306
When Beckham and Olson resurface,

26:14.406 --> 26:16.342
they're in for
a rude awakening.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.182
Did you get anywhere
with Peter Foster?

26:23.282 --> 26:24.984
No, but all signs
point to him being

26:25.084 --> 26:26.385
the last person to see
Grace alive.

26:26.485 --> 26:28.220
He knows more than
he's letting on,

26:28.320 --> 26:30.489
I'm sure of it.
Well, be that as it may,
he lawyered up,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.925
and all we've got is
a misdemeanor violation

26:33.025 --> 26:34.060
for the weapon.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.527
City Attorney won't bite.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.930
They will once I can prove
Foster's guilty of more.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.966
That's a big if
right now.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.801
And let's say
you did get the proof.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.637
You don't want
your arrest tainted.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.438
I got to cut him loose.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.207
I'm starting to feel
like we're scratching

26:48.307 --> 26:49.642
the bottom of the
well on this one.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.477
Well, I'd say keep hope alive,

26:51.577 --> 26:54.881
but it rarely survives when
you're this far down the well.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.583
Neither does anything
or anyone else.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.657
Hey, kid,

27:38.758 --> 27:40.159
you seen my buddy
Danny anywhere?

27:40.259 --> 27:41.894
No, but I got some news
you'll want to hear.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.963
The tracking alert you put on
Grace's bank cards paid off.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.431
One of them was used
this morning.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.966
Where?
A Walmart.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.567
I'm waiting on
the credit card company

27:48.667 --> 27:50.469
to get back to me with
store location and details.

27:50.569 --> 27:53.139
You let me know the minute
you hear something. Yeah.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.814
I confirmed that Patrol has
all six potential victims

28:01.914 --> 28:03.582
in protective custody.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.752
Still no sign of
Olson or Beckham.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.419
All right. 50-Squad came up
empty when they searched

28:07.519 --> 28:08.721
Olson and Beckham's homes.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.857
You think they
cut and run?
No leads.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.491
What if they're after
a bigger score?

28:12.591 --> 28:14.794
I've been going through the data
on Chauncey Telluride's laptop.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.429
It wasn't just client
information that was stolen.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.831
There's supplier data, too.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.533
Suppliers? As in...
Gold wholesalers.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.335
Telluride's just a broker,
a middleman.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.871
He finds investors,

28:24.971 --> 28:26.605
but somebody's got to supply
him with the actual gold.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.440
And a wholesaler's gonna have

28:28.540 --> 28:30.609
a much larger gold inventory
than any of the investors.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.178
Likely millions of
dollars' worth.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.881
And this crew knows who
supplied Telluride's gold?

28:34.981 --> 28:37.649
Looks like it came from a local
wholesaler named Mike McGill.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.119
He's an L.A. native with
a house in Pacific Palisades.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.954
That guy's worth
over 200 million, wow.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.757
If I were Olson and Beckham,
and I knew SWAT was on my tail,

28:44.857 --> 28:46.292
I'd go for one
last, big score.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.594
Short of robbing a mint,
McGill's the next best thing.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.562
Get to McGill's home ASAP.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.214
Cara, did you move
the shipping boxes?

29:17.589 --> 29:18.991
Babe?

29:24.163 --> 29:27.066
Hey, Cara? Babe?

29:29.201 --> 29:31.370
Mr. McGill.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.839
Who the hell are you?

29:32.939 --> 29:34.506
All you need to know is
that we will be taking

29:34.606 --> 29:35.908
all the gold you own.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.743
Move.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.586
LUCA
That's the suspects' truck.

29:47.686 --> 29:48.988
They're already here.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.525
30-David. I need Patrol
to set up a perimeter.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.527
SWAT's preparing
to make entry.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.996
No sign of the suspects.

29:57.096 --> 29:58.764
Must already
be inside.

29:58.865 --> 30:00.532
No sign of forced entry.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.168
I could hop over it,
open the gate,

30:02.268 --> 30:04.570
but if they're watching...
We'd be sitting ducks.

30:04.670 --> 30:05.938
Stevens, grab the ladder.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.942
We'll move north along the wall,
we'll go up and over

30:10.042 --> 30:11.510
and approach the house
from the northeast side.

30:11.610 --> 30:15.047
This property's huge and our
suspects are trigger-happy.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.782
Let's not give them
a chance to take another life.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.217
Let's move.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.164
Powell, you're up.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.807
I'll take this.
You finish the last case.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.880
Cops!

30:51.717 --> 30:54.286
There's still
more bars to grab.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.404
Second floor.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.908
Contact.
Got a suspect on the stairs.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.245
We're in pursuit
to the second floor.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.253
Gun!

31:28.988 --> 31:31.823
28-David.
One suspect down.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.863
Street.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.337
Deac.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.006
All right?

31:47.106 --> 31:48.540
Yeah.
Can you get up?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.912
He took my husband
to the garage.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.382
30-David, be advised.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.584
The suspect is headed
to the garage with a hostage.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.886
Open it!

32:04.323 --> 32:05.757
Come on!

32:05.857 --> 32:07.659
That's where we keep
our gun safes.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.361
Gun safes, plural?

32:15.701 --> 32:16.602
25-David.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.070
Entering the garage now.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.305
30-David.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.439
Do not enter the garage.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.949
Suspect has access to multiple
firearms in the garage.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.284
Do not enter.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.785
I repeat, do not enter.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.321
Just let me
take my gold and go!

32:35.421 --> 32:36.955
That ain't your gold!

32:37.056 --> 32:40.392
Possession's eleven-tenths of
the law where I come from.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.793
Don't think math
works like that.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.729
This works how
I say it works.

32:43.829 --> 32:47.433
You come any closer
and I kill everybody.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.804
25-David. Olson's in
the center of the garage.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.506
McGill's on the ground.
Not moving.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.641
You should have a clear shot

32:55.741 --> 32:57.243
if we open
the middle garage door.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.045
Sounds like our best option.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.780
Stevens, Powell,
let's get eyes on that garage.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.716
Come on, Ty, don't
make this harder

33:04.816 --> 33:06.852
than it needs to be.
I already told you.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.120
Let me go,

33:08.220 --> 33:09.288
and everybody
gets to live.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.322
How about you surrender

33:10.422 --> 33:12.091
and everyone lives anyway?

33:12.191 --> 33:13.825
30-David, moving
into position.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.362
Wait for my signal
to open that door.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.966
Set.
Set.

33:21.067 --> 33:21.967
Set.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.235
Set.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.605
On my count.
Three, two, one...

33:26.705 --> 33:27.973
initiate.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.648
Luca, Tan, go!

33:36.748 --> 33:37.916
LAPD!

33:51.697 --> 33:54.566
25-David to Command.
Last suspect down.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.702
We're Code 4.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.370
20-Squad, show

33:58.470 --> 34:00.606
units 240, 754
responding, Code 4.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.842
All right, we got you.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.668
Danny, no! No!

34:29.768 --> 34:31.303
Hondo, what are you...

34:31.403 --> 34:32.738
Hondo, look,
get off of me.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.873
Think about
what you're doing.
He deserves this.

34:34.973 --> 34:37.075
He broke in and assaulted me.
I want his ass arrested.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.445
Wait, what are you...
Take these cuffs off me.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.513
I hope you
rot in jail.

34:41.613 --> 34:42.814
Danny, no!

34:42.914 --> 34:45.151
No! Sit down!
Okay, okay, okay.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.052
Shut up, both of you.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.388
Listen to me, kid.

34:49.488 --> 34:50.622
The way I see it,

34:50.722 --> 34:51.990
you got two options:

34:52.090 --> 34:54.025
option one...

34:54.126 --> 34:55.861
go ahead, press charges,

34:55.961 --> 34:57.529
but then we'll get
Grace on the record

34:57.629 --> 34:59.598
with exactly how she got
every bruise on her body

34:59.698 --> 35:01.967
that you gave her.
Thought she was missing.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.569
She isn't anymore.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.442
I promise you
there ain't no judge

35:10.542 --> 35:11.877
who's gonna go easy on

35:11.977 --> 35:13.445
a repeat domestic violence
offender like you.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.846
So that brings us
to option two.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.215
You consider
yourself lucky

35:16.315 --> 35:17.516
that I just ran up in here.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.385
And this ends
right here, right now.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.852
And we all move on
with our lives.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.855
Hey, man, how do you
expect me to explain this?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.891
You fell down some stairs,
you ran into a door.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.460
You make up an excuse,
just like you did with Grace.

35:30.028 --> 35:32.764
It's your call, kid.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.800
Which way you want to go?

35:37.703 --> 35:39.505
Just get out of my apartment.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.006
Danny, get up.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.047
If I ever

35:49.147 --> 35:52.651
hear about you laying another
finger on an innocent woman,

35:52.751 --> 35:55.020
I promise you,
on everything I'm made of,

35:55.120 --> 35:57.423
you'll learn
what "rough" really means.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.297
Glad I caught you guys.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.933
I was just on my way back
to the hospital with some things

36:08.033 --> 36:09.100
for my aunt.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.002
She's gonna pull through?
Looks like it.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.071
Thanks to you.
And the doctors,
too, I bet.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.807
The doctors said the blood loss
would've killed her

36:15.907 --> 36:17.243
if you hadn't arrived
when you did.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.511
So... thank you.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.214
Your aunt's gonna be
getting a full refund

36:22.314 --> 36:24.683
on her investment from
Chauncey Telluride...

36:24.783 --> 36:25.884
...the gold broker
she invested with.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.853
All $100K, not
a penny less.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.821
I know she'll appreciate that.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.890
Personally, I am just happy

36:31.990 --> 36:33.692
I get to spend
more time with her.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.527
You can't put
a price on that.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.129
No, you really can't.
Thank you.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.131
Thank you.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.807
It's been a long day.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.942
How about we go raise
a glass of Johnnie Walker Blue

36:51.042 --> 36:53.745
to your Aunt Noreen?
My treat.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.299
Why'd you lie to me, Danny?

37:16.034 --> 37:17.569
Grace used her debit card at

37:17.669 --> 37:19.438
a Walmart in Billings
this morning.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.340
She is perfectly
fine in Montana.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.310
She is not fine, Hondo!

37:24.410 --> 37:26.144
She's not fine.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.048
That bastard assaulted her.

37:31.683 --> 37:35.020
He beat the hell
out of my baby girl.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.460
She showed up
on my doorstep

37:41.560 --> 37:44.563
two days ago,
all bruised up.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.433
I could still see
the handprints on her neck.

37:47.533 --> 37:50.436
Nuh-uh.
I needed to know

37:50.536 --> 37:53.772
who did that,
and he needed to pay.
Danny!

37:53.872 --> 37:56.007
If you had just
told me this,

37:56.107 --> 37:59.545
we could've arrested
Foster the right way.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.880
I didn't know
who he was until today.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.184
Gracie wouldn't
tell me anything.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.686
She wouldn't talk to me.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.655
My baby was ashamed,

38:09.755 --> 38:12.858
and too scared
to even talk to me.

38:16.161 --> 38:20.231
The one time
she needed me the most...

38:20.332 --> 38:21.667
and I wasn't there.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.735
I was a hundred miles away,

38:23.835 --> 38:27.138
clueless to how bad
she was getting hurt.

38:27.238 --> 38:28.874
I failed her.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.112
I ain't gonna lie.

38:34.212 --> 38:35.814
A part of me definitely
wanted to let you

38:35.914 --> 38:38.149
beat the crap out of
Peter Foster tonight.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.018
I mean, if he had
hurt my little girl,

38:40.118 --> 38:41.453
I'd've wanted to do
exactly what you did,

38:41.553 --> 38:45.056
bust down his door,
and whup his ass. But!

38:45.156 --> 38:47.893
Our daughters
need us, Danny.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.530
If I had let you
go through with it,

38:51.630 --> 38:54.466
you'd be spending the next five
years of your life behind bars.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.301
Maybe more!

38:58.069 --> 39:00.572
How are you supposed to
help Grace from there?

39:00.672 --> 39:03.609
Huh? Danny, your daughter
needs you in her life,

39:03.709 --> 39:06.277
not locked up
in a jail cell.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.451
I was just trying
to be there for her...

39:13.752 --> 39:15.654
...and I messed up.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.356
What am I supposed to do
if that happens again?

39:19.324 --> 39:21.226
Apologize.

39:22.494 --> 39:25.664
Yeah, you apologize
and you try again.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.133
And then you keep
on trying and trying

39:28.233 --> 39:31.637
and trying and you try
until you fix it, man.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.305
Or you collapse from
the sheer effort.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.277
That's what being
a father is.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.883
Listen, if we hurry...

39:44.983 --> 39:46.852
we can get you home

39:46.952 --> 39:49.254
on the last flight
out of LAX tonight.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.257
Get you back to
your daughter.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.092
All right, thank you.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.170
Hey, babe. Mm.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.207
I didn't mean
to wake you up. Mm.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.476
I was trying to
wait up for you,

40:44.576 --> 40:46.478
but I must've conked out.

40:49.715 --> 40:51.950
You had a rough day?

40:53.018 --> 40:54.419
You good?

40:57.556 --> 40:59.691
Baby, I will be--
once we get Vivie

40:59.791 --> 41:01.392
some self-defense
classes.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.197
Krav Maga, jiujitsu, aikido...

41:06.297 --> 41:08.800
...maybe all of the above. Mm.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.435
I'm with you.

41:10.536 --> 41:13.004
But I think she's gonna need
to learn how to walk first.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.342
Touché.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.049
Hey.

41:25.183 --> 41:27.252
You sleep.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.020
I got this.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.867
There's my baby girl.
