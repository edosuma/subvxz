I don't, do you?
Okay.

Okay, I'm gonna be honest,
I just don't know anything.

so much, sweetie!"

14:25.866 --> 14:27.966
not the third act,
that you're fucking a ghost.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.501
REDGE: Unless we're
doing an M. Night
Shyamalama thing...

14:30.503 --> 14:32.303
We are not gonna
do an M. Night
Shyamalama thing!

14:34.540 --> 14:36.307
Did I tell you how many
guys I slept with
after our last breakup?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.142
No?

14:38.978 --> 14:39.878
Seven.

14:40.579 --> 14:41.946
Wow!

14:42.381 --> 14:43.448
Yep.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.551
That's kind of
a lot, right?

14:46.553 --> 14:49.220
It's... It's not a little.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.023
So you're gonna
do that in front of
hundreds of people?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.058
Yeah.
Okay. That's ridiculous.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.193
Right.
You do
know that, right?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.561
No, no, I do,
I do, I do.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.529
I know that it's
ridiculous to win the finals

14:58.531 --> 15:00.632
and get a month
of free alcohol.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.267
Horny college girls
knowing that we know
how to fuck?

15:02.269 --> 15:03.401
It's silly, actually.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.536
Okay, guys, order up!

15:05.538 --> 15:08.106
Ooh!
REDGE: Backdoor Tacos
never die!

15:08.108 --> 15:09.641
They just multiply.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.976
REDGE: Ah, <i> muchas gracias!</i>

15:11.978 --> 15:14.679
Look, man, can we just
go to a regular bar, like
the Dog & Duck?

15:15.648 --> 15:18.082
The Dog & Duck
suck and fuck?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.651
Fuck that place.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.185
What do you mean,
"Fuck that place"?

15:21.187 --> 15:23.588
He lost it
in the divorce.
Shut the fuck up, Joey.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.392
Just wanted
some other dick, you know?
Yeah...

15:27.394 --> 15:29.661
Like, I live
with Jeff's dick.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.963
It's just so familiar.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.398
I see his pee
coming out of it
and I'm like,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.166
"Oh, I have sex
with that sometimes."

15:35.168 --> 15:37.135
It's like an appliance.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.137
Like a microwave.

15:39.139 --> 15:42.240
Like a tiny
little microwave.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.375
It's tiny?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.611
Oh, like the fist
of a preemie.
Ew.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.646
(MOCKINGLY)
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

15:49.648 --> 15:51.282
Stan's is...
Is what?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.217
Is huge?

15:53.219 --> 15:55.219
No.
Is hairy?

15:55.221 --> 15:57.121
No.
Is it all crooked?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.523
What?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.658
Hey, I once had sex
with this guy

16:00.660 --> 16:02.994
whose dick was
so crooked it looked
like a question mark

16:02.996 --> 16:04.095
whenever he got hard.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.330
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:05.332 --> 16:07.565
Oh! What do you
want to know, little lady?

16:07.567 --> 16:08.666
(CHUCKLING)

16:09.301 --> 16:10.535
No, it's...

16:12.571 --> 16:13.571
It's perfect.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.340
No, Cath,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.141
"Was", okay?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.209
You gotta put that dick
in the past tense.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.244
No, I know.

16:21.714 --> 16:25.049
Losing the sex stuff
and the relationship stuff,

16:25.051 --> 16:26.384
it's been hard.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.456
But losing the friendship's
been the worst.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.058
And I could really
use a friend up there
right now.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.193
Oh, buddy.

16:37.229 --> 16:40.098
Sometimes I just
wanna check in
with him, you know.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.532
Yeah.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.534
Hear about
what he's doing.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.602
Okay, come here.
(FUNK MUSIC PLAYING)

16:44.604 --> 16:46.004
Stand here.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.639
No reason to be
nervous, okay?

16:48.641 --> 16:50.708
We're gonna do something
very, very simple.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.077
It's not even sexual,
okay? I just want you to

16:53.079 --> 16:54.112
do a little
exercise with me.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.048
Huh?

16:57.050 --> 16:59.283
We're just doing
some Tai Chi,
that's all this is.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.185
Is this weird?
Yeah, this is weird.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.187
Well, that's on you,
my friend.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.790
Okay. Now, we're
just gonna make
a little adjustment.

17:05.791 --> 17:09.093
I just want you
to turn your hands inward,
like that.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.128
Huh? Now look
what happened!

17:11.131 --> 17:12.696
There it is!
What's all this, now?

17:12.699 --> 17:15.133
Oh, my gosh,
we're having sex
with a beautiful woman.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.201
Wow, so beautiful.
Yeah, man,
just go with that.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.103
Now just
elaborate on that.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.439
You can be
the best sex guy ever,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.808
your dick can be
30 feet long.
JOE: Daredevil, man.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.277
Dude, go with that!
Aah! Aah!

17:26.279 --> 17:29.047
JOE: Wet her whistle, man.
Jingle her bells.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.416
My dick is so big!

17:31.418 --> 17:33.317
This is her face,
that's her ass, go.
You see that?

17:33.319 --> 17:34.685
Oh, it's good, it's good,
you're really good.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.587
Help, get into it, though,
like, join me.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.556
'Cause that's her ass
and this is her...
That's okay, you do this one.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.059
I'll take the next one,
you do this one.
Ooh!

17:41.061 --> 17:42.293
Come on.
Yeah, there it is.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.264
That was
her head, I think.
No, I've got her head.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.799
You're going
in the ass.
Okay.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.333
Look. Let's try
something over here.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.268
Okay.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.805
Oh! You are so
fucking pretty, Cathy!

17:53.807 --> 17:55.807
What? No!
Yeah!

17:55.809 --> 17:58.309
I'm serious, dude.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.844
This is gonna sell
like crazy once
I get it on my site.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.779
Of course it will!

18:11.623 --> 18:12.857
Just some loser

18:14.626 --> 18:16.627
All right.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.329

18:18.331 --> 18:18.629
(LAUGHING)
(SHUTTER CLICKING)

18:37.249 --> 18:39.283
JEFF: But it's true, though,
in Africa they...

18:39.285 --> 18:41.185
There's many cultures,
there's a bunch
of countries...

18:41.187 --> 18:43.254
Hey. Hey, guys?
Why don't we just, like,

18:43.256 --> 18:45.289
hit up a bunch
of different bars?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.625
You know, just stop
at a bunch of places,
get shots at each one,

18:47.627 --> 18:49.760
I'll buy shots.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.230
Stan, I understand
if you want to sit out
on the bench tonight.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.831
I get that you have
body-shame issues,
you've got fat knees,

18:53.833 --> 18:56.134
that's not your fault,
all right?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.736
But it doesn't mean
you can't still bang some
strange this evening, buddy.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.404
Okay, yeah. It's been
a long time

19:00.406 --> 19:01.706
since you entered
the field of battle,

19:01.708 --> 19:03.574
that's true.
Uh-huh.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.509
And you're worried
about hatching out
of your shell

19:04.511 --> 19:05.877
before you're
fully incubated.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.545
Nobody likes preemies,
they're disgusting.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.614
That's not
gonna be an issue,

19:09.616 --> 19:11.516
because I'm gonna give
you a couple of arrows
to put into your quiver.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.351
That's going to help you
to bring down the big game.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.386
Maybe pick one metaphor?
Okay.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.821
I'm just assuming
that you...
Follow me here, Stan.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.890
Girls guard the vagina.

19:18.892 --> 19:19.924
Yeah, they guard it
with their life.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.760
Okay? So we have
to guard the penis.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.196
Oh, okay.
Like a hockey goal,
you know?

19:25.198 --> 19:26.631
He doesn't like metaphors.
The puck
is the vagina.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.365
He doesn't like them,
so we're not
gonna use metaphors.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.468
Stan?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.870
You've gotta let them know
they can't have this.

19:32.872 --> 19:36.374
Because people always want
what they can't have.
What they can't have...

19:36.376 --> 19:39.710
See?
So, you've gotta be
an asshole!

19:39.712 --> 19:42.213
Yeah, but not
a giant asshole.
Right.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.548
You can't be
an unfuckable asshole,

19:43.550 --> 19:44.749
you have
to be discreet.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.618
You have to
say things to women

19:47.620 --> 19:49.754
that appear
nice at first...
Very discreet.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.356
Right. They appear
nice, but really,
they're kind of mean.

20:11.476 --> 20:12.944
Do y'all have a tab?
Jenkins.

20:20.686 --> 20:24.655
Woo, that is a serious
STD sandwich.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.258
Who cares about them,
this is our night, right?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.460
Mmm-hmm.
Here is to home.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.996
This will always be home,
no matter what.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.365
Boom! ATX in the hizzle!

20:34.367 --> 20:36.400

How's it going, ladies?

20:39.272 --> 20:40.571
Wow, you girls
look really pretty.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.607
I'm sorry, are you lost?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.909
(LAUGHING)
You're funny,
I like your hair.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.577
And your tats.
You wanna dance?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.546
Mmm, no.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.514
Oh. Why?
Is your boyfriend here?

20:50.516 --> 20:52.250
I don't have a boyfriend.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.019
He's an idiot!
(LAUGHING)

20:55.021 --> 20:57.888
Okay, so,
for example, um...

20:57.890 --> 20:59.824
You would say something
like, "That's a beautiful
dress you have on,

20:59.826 --> 21:01.626
"it really makes
your ass look small."

21:01.628 --> 21:03.728
Or, like my friend says,
"You're a fat ass,

21:03.730 --> 21:06.297
"but you're really
not that big."
(LAUGHS)

21:06.299 --> 21:07.698
Or, "Hey, is that
a beauty mark,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.000
"or do you just have
some shit on your face?"

21:09.002 --> 21:10.801
That's really good.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.337
That's really...
Can I use that?

21:13.339 --> 21:15.373
Yeah, of course.
That's a good line.

21:16.508 --> 21:17.942
Essentially, what
we're doing, Stan,

21:17.944 --> 21:19.910
is we're lowering
their self-esteem

21:19.912 --> 21:21.312
so that then
they look to us
for validation

21:21.314 --> 21:23.381
and we can...

21:23.383 --> 21:28.519
you tell girls they're
ugly so they'll want
to have sex with you.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.453
Yeah.
In a nutshell.

Yeah, it's... I...

can I get you
another drink?

21:58.685 --> 22:00.618
Uh, no, that's okay...

22:00.620 --> 22:02.720
I mean, I think
you look like
you need another drink.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.655
Um...

22:04.657 --> 22:06.857
Here, have some of mine.
No, I'm fine.

No, no, no,
no roofies in this one.

I'm gonna leave you.

Oh.

No, actually, I was
just about to, um...

22:25.010 --> 22:27.044
To go.
Oh, are you?

possibly make this
any more awkward.

What? That's
your brother?

Unfortunately, yes.

made this
way more awkward.

I didn't come here
to stalk her.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.487
No? You came here to see me.
That's amazing, Stan.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.922
That's awesome. Hi!

35:58.924 --> 36:00.357
Hold this, please.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.392
Hello, ladies.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.661
How you doing?

36:04.663 --> 36:07.631
Hey, I just wanna say
I thought that you did
absolutely incredible.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.399
Whatever, Dinocock.
Fuck off.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.567
Uh. I am not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.937
I'm just on our
way out, so...

36:13.939 --> 36:18.909
Oh, well, if we would
have had your candy-ass
cheerleaders

36:18.911 --> 36:20.510
on our side then
maybe we would have.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.878
Okay, can I speak with
you for a second?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.480
No, no.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.382
Um, yeah.
No, no.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.716
Okay.
Seriously?

36:26.718 --> 36:28.251
Hey, nice to meet you.

36:28.253 --> 36:29.519
Nice to meet you.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.687
Yeah, you, too.
Yeah. Okay.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.324
How do you do it?

36:35.893 --> 36:37.227
What?
How do you do the splits?

36:38.629 --> 36:40.697
Oh! Um...

36:40.699 --> 36:42.199
Drill team.
Drill team?

36:42.201 --> 36:43.800
Yeah.
Okay.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.435
Can you, um...
Can you teach me?

36:45.970 --> 36:46.870
What?

36:48.272 --> 36:49.539
Those teabags are
looking at us.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.647
Oh!

36:58.549 --> 36:59.683
It's on, bro.

36:59.685 --> 37:00.483
Oh, hell yeah,
it's on, bro.

37:02.987 --> 37:03.954
Is there something
on my face?

37:03.956 --> 37:05.455
No.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.790
It's just beautiful.

37:08.759 --> 37:09.659
Oh!

37:12.296 --> 37:14.397
We don't need
you all to be doing
no pornos in here.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.266
We are so sorry.

37:16.268 --> 37:18.435
He might have had
a few too many
drinks this evening.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.737
This is a family place.

37:20.739 --> 37:21.905
We completely understand.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.811
Nicely done, guys.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.447
Oh, God. What?
Are you serious?
Perfect.

37:30.449 --> 37:31.748
Deal's a deal.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.717
Of course, I'm serious.
You know, I'm...

37:33.719 --> 37:35.385
Come on, Timmy, you're
not the boss of me.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.786
Leave the girl alone.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.288
All right, all right.
Let's go home.

37:38.290 --> 37:39.356
All right. Whatever.
All right?

37:39.790 --> 37:41.858
Yes.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.560
No, no.
No, she said yes. Dude!

37:43.562 --> 37:45.562
All right, out the door.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.530
Ladies, we'll be outside.
This is...

37:47.532 --> 37:48.732
Just let me go.
I know.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.838
Are you...
That little weirdo's dick
is fucking enormous.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.640
I don't care if it's
six feet long.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.008
You're just gonna
leave me here?

37:58.010 --> 38:01.311
I'm leaving you with
the "Midnight Cowboy".

38:01.313 --> 38:03.947
And I am taking
one for the team.

38:04.982 --> 38:06.683
This isn't college anymore.

38:07.518 --> 38:08.752
Pretend.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.688
You are getting horny.

38:12.523 --> 38:14.457
Very horny.

38:15.426 --> 38:16.926
Have fun.

38:16.928 --> 38:17.961
I will if you will.

38:19.997 --> 38:21.598
Cool, bro.
All right, let him go.

38:23.434 --> 38:24.634
Ah!

38:24.636 --> 38:25.935
Hey.

38:25.937 --> 38:29.306
Oh, God. Oh, my...

38:29.308 --> 38:30.740
Bye, Katie.
I did this for you.

38:30.742 --> 38:31.741
It's Cathy.

38:34.945 --> 38:35.779
Where are they?

38:37.615 --> 38:39.482
I don't see 'em
and they were
following us, right?

38:39.484 --> 38:40.617
Jeff, they were
following us, yeah?

38:40.619 --> 38:41.418
They will be here.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.324
Stan?
Hmm?

38:47.326 --> 38:48.491
What are you doing?

38:48.493 --> 38:49.659
Nothing.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.594
(WHINING)

38:51.596 --> 38:53.496
My name is Stan.
I made a mistake
and I want you back.

38:55.766 --> 38:57.767
That was an excellent
impersonation of me.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.669
That was... It was like
looking in a mirror.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.838
Here they come.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.740
Here they come.
Yes.

39:03.742 --> 39:04.641
It's all right.
Bring it on, ladies.
Bring it in.

39:05.543 --> 39:07.777
REDGE: Come on, right here.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.346
Maybe I wasn't even thinking
about her just now, dude.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.348
Maybe I was thinking
about another girl.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.049
Like, maybe a girl
I met tonight.

39:14.552 --> 39:15.518
I don't know, maybe she
gave me her number.

39:17.054 --> 39:17.787
Why are you just telling
me this just now?

39:18.989 --> 39:20.757
Well, suddenly
you're interested.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.058
Did you tell her that she
had shit on her face?

39:22.060 --> 39:23.893
No, she did
that to me.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.096
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

39:26.098 --> 39:27.697
What are you doing here with
your dick in your pants?

39:27.699 --> 39:28.898
You should have your dick
in her mouth, buddy.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.066
Come on, this is good.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.501
This is good.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.502
I love this.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.137
Very good.

39:34.139 --> 39:37.507
I will take you...
Oh, yes. I will take you.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.442
You wanna do that?
Okay, let's do...

39:39.444 --> 39:40.577
Mule train?
No, I'm all right.

39:40.579 --> 39:41.778
Okay, okay. Well...
No thanks.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.079
(ALL CHATTERING)

39:46.984 --> 39:49.452
Okay.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.021
So, Stan,

39:52.023 --> 39:55.091
there are four guys and
three girls and you have a
phone number in your pocket.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.127
I think you need to
make a phone call.

39:57.129 --> 39:58.595
Now...
You got a short window, buddy,
you need to lay some track.

39:59.630 --> 40:00.430
I don't...

40:01.832 --> 40:03.066
Hello.
Ooh!

40:09.140 --> 40:12.041
I don't... I think
I'm just gonna text,
dude, right?

40:12.043 --> 40:13.877
Probably texting
is better at this
stage 'cause,

40:15.012 --> 40:15.845
you know...

40:17.715 --> 40:18.715
Oh, I wish I had her email.

40:22.720 --> 40:23.520
(PHONE BEEPS)

41:13.003 --> 41:13.770
(PHONE BEEPS)

41:26.517 --> 41:27.116

42:23.674 --> 42:25.108
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

42:25.110 --> 42:27.143
Ooh, I'm sorry.
That's been broken
for a while.

42:27.145 --> 42:29.012
Oh, yeah.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.280
There's a 7-Eleven
I could walk you to
to finish your business.

42:32.082 --> 42:32.982
Come here.

42:34.852 --> 42:36.719
I think that something
is moving in there.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.154
You should see
the bathroom,
totally gross.

42:39.189 --> 42:39.989
What's she doing?

42:40.791 --> 42:42.091
Ground. So that's it.

42:42.093 --> 42:42.992
ALL: Whoa!

42:46.030 --> 42:47.630
Whoa!

42:47.632 --> 42:48.331
Dude, you can do it.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.699
Absolutely.

42:49.701 --> 42:52.602
(ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE)

42:52.604 --> 42:53.636
All right.
Just need to breathe.

42:53.638 --> 42:55.004
It does not look that hard.

42:55.006 --> 42:56.706
Breathing, that's not
gonna be an issue

42:56.708 --> 42:57.907
I've been breathing
since I was born.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.842
Look. Already half way.

42:59.844 --> 43:00.977
Half way to finals.

43:00.979 --> 43:01.878
(SCREAMING)

43:01.880 --> 43:03.112
No!

43:03.114 --> 43:03.880
(PHONE BEEPS)

43:04.949 --> 43:06.649
That's final, right there.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.017
That was incredible.

43:08.752 --> 43:09.652
(SCREAMS)

43:10.087 --> 43:11.154
What?

43:11.156 --> 43:12.088
What is that?

43:12.590 --> 43:14.324
(LAUGHS)

43:14.326 --> 43:16.125
My God, that's
a hairy python.

43:16.127 --> 43:17.827
No, that's not a python.
That's a dick.

43:27.204 --> 43:28.071
(LAUGHS)

43:28.672 --> 43:30.640
Oh, thank God.

43:32.776 --> 43:33.343
(PHONE BEEPS)

43:50.194 --> 43:50.960
So, this is you.

43:52.262 --> 43:53.663
Yeah, this is...
This is me.

43:55.366 --> 43:56.199
Good night.

43:57.868 --> 43:59.202
Yes.
Yes.

44:00.337 --> 44:01.804
Good night.
Yes.

44:02.940 --> 44:03.873
Okay.

44:07.111 --> 44:07.910
All right.

44:11.281 --> 44:13.950
Okay, we're gonna do
that one more time.
Yes.

44:13.952 --> 44:15.952
Let me go ahead
and give you my card.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.754
Cool.
Give me a phone
call, anytime.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.258
You're a veterinarian?

44:22.260 --> 44:25.762
I am a doctor
of small animals.

44:25.764 --> 44:26.262
Don't I look like one?

44:27.398 --> 44:29.232
Oh, you absolutely do.

44:29.234 --> 44:31.067
Yeah. Like, even
from that angle?

44:31.069 --> 44:32.669
Oh, especially
from that angle.

44:32.671 --> 44:34.103
(STAMMERING)

44:34.105 --> 44:36.406
I'm a... I'm
in med school.

44:36.408 --> 44:38.975
No kidding.
That's funny.
Yeah.

44:38.977 --> 44:40.309
What made you
become a vet?
That's funny.

44:40.311 --> 44:43.046
I worked with dogs
in the Marines.

44:43.048 --> 44:45.281
Yeah. Bomb sniffing
dogs, just kinda...

44:45.283 --> 44:46.449
Just like fell
into it.

44:46.451 --> 44:49.819
You were in
the Marines?

44:49.821 --> 44:51.921
Yeah, yeah. But the
dogs started making
better conversations

44:51.923 --> 44:54.090
than some of those
jarheads I was
working with.

44:54.092 --> 44:55.992
Right.
So I had to get out of
there as fast as I could.

44:55.994 --> 44:58.061
So, that makes
you like a...

44:59.196 --> 45:00.730
A vet vet.

45:01.999 --> 45:02.865
Yes.

45:03.734 --> 45:04.367
Yes, it does.

45:06.170 --> 45:07.704
Wow.

45:07.706 --> 45:08.304
I had fun tonight.

45:09.473 --> 45:10.306
Yeah, I did, too.

45:14.878 --> 45:15.378
Well, let's
do it again.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.347
Thank you for the dance.

45:19.049 --> 45:19.916
Thank you

45:20.884 --> 45:23.820
for the dance.

45:23.822 --> 45:24.854
REDGE: Oh, come on,
I don't hear anything.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.856
Hey, guys.
How's it going?

45:26.858 --> 45:28.124
You guys hear anything
in there, I don't think
they're fucking.

45:28.126 --> 45:29.292
Oh, hey, dude.

45:29.294 --> 45:31.294
Hey, they're not fucking.

45:31.296 --> 45:33.963
I didn't give up my room
for you guys not to fuck.

45:33.965 --> 45:34.964
Let's go.
It's just really gross here.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.934
It's like so gross.

45:37.936 --> 45:39.202
I can't get the keys
because she's got them
in there with that creep.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.737
Hey, I got brews here
if you wanna...

45:40.739 --> 45:42.371
No, I'm all right.
No, no, you have them.

45:47.177 --> 45:48.745
(MUMBLES)

45:48.747 --> 45:49.445
What is it?

45:55.419 --> 45:56.252
Is it real?

45:57.321 --> 45:59.155
Is it from the internet?

45:59.157 --> 46:01.057
I mean, have you seen
a penis this big before?

46:01.059 --> 46:02.158
Could you put
that away, please?

46:04.027 --> 46:05.194
JOE: Whoa!

46:05.196 --> 46:07.096
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

46:07.098 --> 46:09.031
If you don't get out
of the bedroom right now,
we're leaving!

46:10.367 --> 46:12.869
Hey, um...

46:12.871 --> 46:15.037
Can I take you to
breakfast in the morning?
What?

46:15.039 --> 46:16.472
No, I wanna take you
to my Saturday place.
Please, please, please.

46:16.474 --> 46:21.310
I love talking to you so
much so I just want to keep
this conversation going on.

46:21.312 --> 46:22.945
Uh.
Please?

46:22.947 --> 46:23.980
I'll think about it.
Okay.

46:23.982 --> 46:26.516
Do you like migas?

46:26.518 --> 46:27.483
Hey, beautiful, don't
knock so hard.
Fuck off.

46:27.485 --> 46:29.051
It was... So sorry.

46:29.053 --> 46:30.853
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
I bet you're sorry.

46:30.855 --> 46:33.022
I wanna get the fuck
out of here.

46:33.024 --> 46:34.423
Hey, honey,
I think I see
something on your face

46:34.425 --> 46:35.424
Don't touch me!

46:37.361 --> 46:38.361
What the fuck
just happened?

46:40.564 --> 46:42.231
I thought I got her wet...

46:42.233 --> 46:44.133
I think she loved you.
I was clear on that.

46:44.135 --> 46:44.834
Yeah, that was well played.

46:50.007 --> 46:52.208
Yeah?

46:52.210 --> 46:54.544
Captain fucker, you were only
in there for seven minutes.

46:54.546 --> 46:56.112
You're a badass.

(PHONE BEEPS)

47:30.914 --> 47:32.114
Fuck!

47:35.552 --> 47:36.552
Where are you going?

47:38.288 --> 47:39.856
El Azteca.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.157
El Azteca?

47:42.192 --> 47:43.125
You wanna wait
for me, man?

47:48.265 --> 47:50.333
Mmm.
This is so good.

47:50.335 --> 47:52.034
You cannot find migas
like this in New York.

47:52.436 --> 47:53.302
Ugh!

47:54.571 --> 47:55.438
Why did you let
me drink so much?

47:58.976 --> 48:00.576
So, what happened
with Ralphie?

48:01.645 --> 48:02.545
We tried.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.146
I threw up.

48:04.915 --> 48:05.948
All over his face.

48:07.618 --> 48:09.085
Oh, God, Kara.

48:09.087 --> 48:10.353
And he actually wanted
to keep going.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.088
Can you believe that?

48:13.390 --> 48:16.492
Puke all over his
face and he's like,

48:16.494 --> 48:16.993
(IN A DEEP VOICE)
"I don't mind."

48:19.897 --> 48:21.364
You always get
the normal ones.

48:34.678 --> 48:35.511
Okay.

48:36.380 --> 48:38.247
You ready?

48:38.249 --> 48:39.482
For breakfast?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Yeah.

48:42.019 --> 48:43.286
Okay, yeah. Out.

48:45.055 --> 48:46.088
My door doesn't open. Out.
Okay.

48:46.090 --> 48:47.023
Okay.

48:49.026 --> 48:51.360
Speaking of which,
did you guys do it?

48:52.229 --> 48:53.562
No.

48:53.564 --> 48:55.097
Why not?
Because I'm not...

48:56.433 --> 48:57.266
Like me?

48:59.069 --> 48:59.702
I didn't say that.

49:02.339 --> 49:04.640
Yeah, it's okay.
If it wasn't for sluts no
one would get laid, right?

49:04.642 --> 49:05.474
(DOOR OPENS)

49:07.945 --> 49:08.978
Oh, no.

49:11.648 --> 49:12.481
CATHY: Oh, no.

49:14.485 --> 49:18.955
I want you to be the better
person in this situation.
Don't touch my face.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.156
No. What...
What situation?

49:20.158 --> 49:20.990
He's here.

49:22.392 --> 49:23.125
He just came
through the door.

49:24.261 --> 49:25.294
Oh, shit.

49:26.430 --> 49:27.396
Oh, shit.
Be strong.

49:28.165 --> 49:28.731
Is he alone?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.567
Um...

49:31.569 --> 49:33.736
I'm gonna go say hi to
a friend over there.
Okay.

49:33.738 --> 49:38.107
And I will be right back.

49:38.109 --> 49:40.509
If I turn around and he
is with some whore...
Just be strong, Kara.

49:40.511 --> 49:43.279
I swear I'll burn this
fucking place to the ground.
CATHY: Okay, breathe.

49:43.281 --> 49:44.080
Breathe.

49:45.315 --> 49:46.482
He's coming over.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.150
Hey!
Take the knives.

49:48.152 --> 49:49.485
Put them in your purse.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.020
Oh, my God!

49:51.022 --> 49:53.122
Hey!
Whoa!

49:53.124 --> 49:54.724
Jeff!
Crazy!

49:55.726 --> 49:56.692
So good to see you.

49:59.262 --> 50:00.062
Hello, Kara.

50:01.264 --> 50:03.499
Oh, well.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.534
Hey there.
What a surprise.

50:05.536 --> 50:07.069
Yeah!

50:07.071 --> 50:07.703
How are you?
So good.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.672
I'm so good.

50:09.674 --> 50:10.606
Yeah, how you doing?

50:11.742 --> 50:13.609
I'm never been better.

50:13.611 --> 50:15.144
Yeah.

50:15.146 --> 50:17.279
'Cause you look so good.

50:17.281 --> 50:19.582
Thank you. So do you.

50:19.584 --> 50:20.449
Thank you.

50:22.119 --> 50:23.686
Especially in that
video last night.

50:23.688 --> 50:26.055
Oh!
Yeah, very impressive.

50:26.057 --> 50:27.456
Yes. Well, I'm going
to the finals.

50:28.058 --> 50:29.392
Oh!
Wow!

50:29.394 --> 50:31.293
I know.
Congratulations.

50:31.295 --> 50:33.062
And I see you've
taken up photography.

50:33.064 --> 50:34.230
That's great.

50:34.232 --> 50:35.464
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, sure have.

50:37.067 --> 50:39.235
What did you think?

50:39.237 --> 50:41.537
I loved it. Great composition,
just really good
lighting all around.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.572
It was really nice work.

50:43.574 --> 50:45.708
Although I notice he's not
here to buy you breakfast.

50:45.710 --> 50:46.675
That's not too classy.

50:47.744 --> 50:49.512
No, no.

50:49.514 --> 50:51.614
But I think it's really classy
that you've bought breakfast

50:51.616 --> 50:53.516
for the little she-whore that
you slept with last night.

50:53.518 --> 50:54.383
JEFF: Yeah.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.820
She's the best.

50:57.822 --> 50:59.221
Yeah. You know,
she looks really familiar.

51:02.492 --> 51:03.559
She really looks like
someone that I know.

51:04.494 --> 51:05.528
Yes.

51:05.530 --> 51:06.796
Oh!

51:06.798 --> 51:08.297
I know who. Me!

51:09.433 --> 51:11.801
(ALL LAUGHING)

51:11.803 --> 51:12.635
Oh, okay.

51:13.804 --> 51:15.204
JEFF: You're right.

51:15.206 --> 51:16.105
I mean, it's...

51:17.474 --> 51:20.376
It's really kinda true.
I'm sorry.

51:22.112 --> 51:23.245
Kinda pathetic, Jeff.

51:24.281 --> 51:26.182
Kind of <i> Vertigo.</i>

51:26.184 --> 51:27.383
You gonna dress her
up in my clothes, too?

51:28.251 --> 51:28.784
No, I would never do that.

51:30.353 --> 51:31.187
I don't even
like your clothes.

51:32.122 --> 51:33.789
So...

51:33.791 --> 51:34.790
Well, we know my guy
didn't look like you.

51:36.460 --> 51:38.227
At least not downstairs.

51:40.564 --> 51:41.297
You guys have
a good breakfast.

51:44.101 --> 51:44.667
That was so good.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.169
I'm so proud of you.

51:48.638 --> 51:49.772
Oh, fuck.
What?

51:51.141 --> 51:52.374
Ow!

51:52.376 --> 51:53.776
God, she even
looks like me.

51:53.778 --> 51:54.710
No, she really doesn't.

51:55.812 --> 51:57.446
Oh, I see.

51:57.448 --> 52:00.149
Hey, don't go in there.
Hey, really don't
go inside, please.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.489
(MOUTHING) I will kill you!

52:06.491 --> 52:07.890
Do you understand?
Oh, my God.

52:07.892 --> 52:08.824
KARA: I will fuck you up.

52:14.531 --> 52:16.432
He's gone. He's gone.

52:16.434 --> 52:17.466
He's gone.
He's gone.

52:19.269 --> 52:21.137
Oh, you got a...

52:21.139 --> 52:21.837
(EXCLAIMS)
You got a chip.

(SNIFFLING)

52:41.358 --> 52:41.857
Take your phone out.

52:42.759 --> 52:44.560
What?

52:44.562 --> 52:45.327
Take your phone out.
Take your phone out.
Why?

52:49.633 --> 52:50.533
Okay.

52:52.202 --> 52:53.502

52:53.504 --> 52:54.537

53:02.946 --> 53:03.879
Yeah.

Three.

53:30.774 --> 53:31.540
You know what, that...

53:32.809 --> 53:34.243
I think that actually
feels good.

53:43.853 --> 53:44.720
You okay?

53:52.229 --> 53:53.829
She drinks my cum, man.

53:57.467 --> 53:58.400
She actually likes it.

54:05.775 --> 54:08.310
Where am I gonna
find somebody who's
that cool ever again?

54:11.848 --> 54:12.715
It's...

54:15.952 --> 54:16.952
No. Yeah, that's
really cool of her.

54:18.822 --> 54:20.256
(ENGINE STARTS)

54:20.258 --> 54:21.757
Yep. Okay. We're moving on.

54:21.759 --> 54:23.826
We're moving on up,
like the mother-fucking

54:24.494 --> 54:25.394
Jeffersons.

54:28.465 --> 54:29.798
Okay, men.

54:29.800 --> 54:30.899

get fucked up.

54:30.901 --> 54:33.402
We are not leaving
this apartment

54:33.404 --> 54:36.505
till we come up with
an air sex routine
that is so depraved

54:36.507 --> 54:39.341
and so sick that we will
be ashamed to look our
own mothers in the eye

out my panties.

Jeffersons.

Okay, guys, you know what
we're gonna do tonight?

55:17.548 --> 55:19.481
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna break free.

55:19.483 --> 55:22.017
We're gonna break free
from their petty needling.

55:22.019 --> 55:24.853
We're gonna break free
from their impossibly
high expectations,

55:24.855 --> 55:26.789
and their fucking harassment

gonna look better
in that corner.

you on my team

about tonight.
Can we do this together?

Nope.

Nobody.

Hey!
Is it someone with a vagina?

Nope. Let's do this.

Yeah, you must fuck the air.

You are a miracle worker.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.053
Mmm-hmm.
I've got boobs.

56:00.690 --> 56:02.691
Normally, it's just like two

56:02.693 --> 56:03.992
sensitive freckles.

Ooh! I'll get it.

56:06.430 --> 56:07.529
Help! Help!
Oh, what?

56:08.365 --> 56:10.532
Now, listen, okay.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.034
Be careful.
Careful?

56:12.036 --> 56:14.403
Yeah, if his dick is as
big as his brother's,

56:14.405 --> 56:15.838
you will be coming home
in a hospital gurney.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.473
Oh, that sounds fun.

56:17.475 --> 56:20.576
Okay, I put condoms
in your bag.
Kara!

56:20.578 --> 56:22.544
What? Don't be
afraid to say yes.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.480
No, no. I'm going
home tomorrow.

56:24.482 --> 56:26.415
I can't leave you
alone tonight.

56:26.417 --> 56:26.982
Who says I'm gonna be alone?

56:28.017 --> 56:30.052
Not Ralphie?

are you fucking kidding me?

56:32.056 --> 56:34.757
Hello. Welcome.
TIM: Hello. Thank you.

56:34.759 --> 56:37.726
Come in. Come in. O-M-G.

56:37.728 --> 56:40.863
Hi. How you doing?
He brought flowers.
Are you from this century?

56:40.865 --> 56:42.831
You totally didn't
need to do this.

56:44.101 --> 56:47.870
See, I did bring flowers,
but they're not for you,
they're for you.

56:47.872 --> 56:49.438
I'm sorry. I would have got
you flowers, but I didn't.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.038
Oh, um...

56:50.974 --> 56:52.141
(CATHY LAUGHS)

56:53.943 --> 56:55.778
It's not funny.
No, it is.

56:55.780 --> 56:58.147
Yeah. He had a moment
the other night,

56:58.149 --> 56:59.148
but he's a real sweet guy.
What?

56:59.682 --> 57:00.983
Right.

57:00.985 --> 57:02.050
Okay!
Bye.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.619
Bye-bye.

57:03.621 --> 57:04.520
All right. All right.
You ready to go?

57:04.522 --> 57:05.754
Bye, Kara.

57:05.756 --> 57:06.855
Be safe.

57:08.892 --> 57:09.792
Yes. Yes.
We will. We will.

57:10.794 --> 57:11.460
Good night.
Goodbye.

57:14.130 --> 57:15.063
Ugh!

57:19.169 --> 57:20.569
So, the Marines...

57:20.571 --> 57:22.104
That's...

57:22.106 --> 57:22.805
Yeah.
Yeah.

57:27.143 --> 57:28.444
So, um...

57:29.512 --> 57:30.946
Did you ever...

57:30.948 --> 57:33.215
Go to war, shoot
someone, get stabbed?

57:33.217 --> 57:35.217
Oh, does everybody
ask you that?

57:35.219 --> 57:36.452
All the time. Yeah.

57:36.454 --> 57:37.486
So sorry.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.154
You should be.

57:43.560 --> 57:44.760
So, did you?

57:44.762 --> 57:45.661
You didn't notice
my wooden leg?

57:49.165 --> 57:50.899
No, I took some shrapnel

57:52.469 --> 57:54.636
to the shoulder.

57:54.638 --> 57:57.206
Wall exploded and piece
of pipe lodged in there.

57:57.974 --> 57:59.041
Had to cut it out.

57:59.043 --> 58:00.642
Oh, my God!

58:00.644 --> 58:01.477
Yeah.

58:02.645 --> 58:03.779
It sounds worse
than it was but...

58:10.253 --> 58:11.019
Can I see it?

58:14.958 --> 58:16.124
Like, now?

58:16.126 --> 58:17.759
Yeah.

58:17.761 --> 58:19.061
Seriously?
Absolutely.

58:20.063 --> 58:20.896
I... We were, um...

58:21.731 --> 58:22.564
We're studying

58:23.766 --> 58:26.068
wound care in
class right now

58:26.070 --> 58:28.704
and it would be highly,
highly educational.

58:31.140 --> 58:32.207
I think they're
gonna let us in.

Actually, Stan, I know
what you should do. Listen,

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.933
there's edible underwear
in the medicine cabinet
at Redge's house.

01:21:12.935 --> 01:21:14.869
The red ones taste terrible,
but the other...
How do you know that?

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:16.470
JEFF: <i> Because, we were stoned</i>
<i>and we had no food</i>

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:19.440
Just shut up, shut up.
Or...

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:21.275
Forgive each other
for ruining
a great relationship

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:23.944
<i>and move on.</i>
<i>Either way we love you.</i>

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:27.248
Stan, for bailing on me
because I was incredible
on stage tonight.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.016
Oh, I fucking
destroyed you!
Everybody knows that...

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.987
It's not that kind
of cab, guys.

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:09.423
(BEEPS)

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:11.358
(LINE RINGING)

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:20.501
(BEEPS)

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.504
(LINE RINGING)

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:30.511
Hi.

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.047
Hey.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.149
TIM: Look out.

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.165
(GIGGLING)

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.202
(MOANING)

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.050
Are you okay?

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:24.999
(MOANING)

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:28.502
(MOANING)

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.579
(KARA PANTING)

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.351
(GRUNTING)

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.157
(GASPING)

01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:10.644
Is my penis, really,
really that small?

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:13.747
Honestly?

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:17.484
I love it.

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:25.259
And what about

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.094
my cavern?

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:32.366
It's like
a little child's.

01:24:32.368 --> 01:24:34.134
Better not know
what that fucking
feels like, you pedo.

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.106
I was complimenting
your vagina.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.810
I said a nice thing.

01:24:42.812 --> 01:24:44.244
You hit me
in the fucking ear
with a chip.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:56.323
Hey.

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:00.294
Good to see you, Cathy.
Oh.

01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:02.596
Bye, Jeff.

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.832
Ah, you called a cab?
Just give me two minutes,
I can take you.

01:25:04.834 --> 01:25:07.201
No, no, I, uh,
heard you, um...

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:10.304
Using the microwave
this morning.

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:11.805
(GIGGLING)
And I didn't wanna bug.

01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:17.544
So, did you guys talk?

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:19.113
Um, no.

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:23.117
Nope, we did not.

01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:25.185
Then why are you smiling?
We did not talk at all.

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:29.423
Oh!
(GIGGLING)

01:25:29.425 --> 01:25:31.792
Fuck, yes!

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:33.327
Mmm.
What?

01:25:33.329 --> 01:25:35.562
Oh!
(GIGGLING)

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:37.831
Oh, shit!
I'm so sore.

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:39.266
Oh, that's my girl.
I'm so sore.

01:25:39.268 --> 01:25:40.167
Yeah.

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:45.806
(HONKING)

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.776
You called a cab?

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:52.279
Yeah, I didn't know
if I was gonna see you.

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:59.653
I'm sorry, dude.
STAN: Oh, don't.
It's no problem.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:01.555
I'm actually very surprised
to see you in pants
this early.

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:03.190
Pants.

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:07.594
Did you call her?

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:09.863
No.
No?

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:13.567
Why are you glowing?
What?

01:26:13.569 --> 01:26:15.669
Why are you so happy?

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.638
Why are you happy?
What happened
last night, huh?

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.206
Did you call that new girl?

01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:21.175
Did you have sex
with that new girl?

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:22.409
Did you fuck
that new girl?
Oh, we made love

01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:24.845
and it was so sweet.

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:26.780
Dude, she's such
a good cuddler.
What are you doing?

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:29.683
We talked for hours.
Get off me!
You're not doing it right.

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.852
That's not the way
you do that.
Get rid of the cab,

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:34.354
I'm driving you
to the airport,
Jesus Christ!

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.690
Hey, listen man, can I just
give you ten bucks?
