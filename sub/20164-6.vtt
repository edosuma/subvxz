00:25.150 --> 00:27.652
In the darkest depths of cyberspace,

00:27.653 --> 00:29.362
there is another world.

00:30.906 --> 00:35.326
A lost dimension,
home to wonders unseen,

00:35.327 --> 00:37.245
terrors unspeakable.

00:39.164 --> 00:43.543
Stories unlike any ever told until now.

01:05.191 --> 01:07.358
Introducing Val Hernandez

01:07.359 --> 01:09.902
or, as she wants the world to know her,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.237
"Speedrun."

01:12.656 --> 01:16.075
An impulsive young gamer
with dreams of greatness,

01:16.076 --> 01:19.579
dreams, for the moment,
that lie just out of reach.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.147
The path to greatness
usually takes hard work,

01:27.172 --> 01:29.130
and time.

01:29.131 --> 01:33.301
But in Dimension 404, all Val needs

01:33.302 --> 01:36.804
is a sweet sip of Impulse 9.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.690
You look all professional!

01:47.691 --> 01:50.026
Yeah, yeah.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.154
- Careful, it's...
- Hot!

01:53.405 --> 01:55.198
No, thank you.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.075
Okay, you got your rÃ©sumÃ©?

01:58.076 --> 02:00.077
And you wrote down the address, right?

02:00.078 --> 02:03.331
I'm just gonna wander around
until I find the place.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.416
Look, I called in a big
favor with your uncle Pedro

02:05.417 --> 02:06.584
to get you that interview.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.586
Plus you haven't had a J-O-B in months.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.170
Thanks for the update, Dad.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.839
Gotta run.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.591
Hey, Val?

02:13.592 --> 02:15.396
What?

02:18.347 --> 02:19.764
Slow down, kid.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.183
When you get in there, just relax,

02:22.184 --> 02:24.089
ask lots of questions,

02:24.114 --> 02:26.270
and look 'em in the eye.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.938
It's just some catering job, Dad.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.732
- I'm not running for Congress.
- Hey.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.692
It's not about what
you do for a living...

02:31.693 --> 02:33.444
It's what you do while you're living.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.613
Okay, go knock 'em dead.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.673
And pick up Grandma from the
doctor's when you're done.

02:38.698 --> 02:40.409
- Can't you do it?
- It's Tuesday,

02:40.410 --> 02:42.328
I work 'til closing.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.414
I love you.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.458
Love you too.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.592
Excuse me, ma'am,

02:56.593 --> 02:58.094
I'm looking for a girl named Speedrun.

02:58.095 --> 03:01.247
Gamer chick, sloppy
hair, crappy clothes.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.643
Hey.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.859
So, what's with the get-up?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.487
Just some stupid job interview.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.114
Don't you think maybe
you should go to that?

03:18.115 --> 03:19.323
And miss the invitational?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.158
No, I'll just call in sick or something.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.660
You get sick more than anyone I know.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.537
First prize wins ten grand!

03:24.538 --> 03:26.288
I could move out and go pro.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.082
Yeah, about that.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.667
I guess you didn't hear the news?

03:29.668 --> 03:31.043
- What?
- You-Know-Who

03:31.044 --> 03:33.587
is making a surprise entrance today.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.297
No!

03:35.298 --> 03:38.134
- Yup.
- Come on!

03:40.011 --> 03:43.514
May the gaming gods have
mercy on our worthless souls.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.224
Killohertz is in the house!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.517
I pity the chumps

03:46.518 --> 03:48.352
that have to rumble with this legend

03:48.353 --> 03:50.020
in today's qualifying rounds.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.501
Really?

03:53.526 --> 03:55.192
He's got nothing better
to do than flex his nuts

03:55.193 --> 03:57.736
at some Podunk tournament in Chino?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.572
Yeah, what do you think he's
gonna spend the $10,000 on,

03:59.573 --> 04:02.111
designer shoes or
more fingerless gloves?

04:02.677 --> 04:05.035
Somebody should knock
that stupid smug look

04:05.036 --> 04:06.579
off his dumb ugly face.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.864
Val.

04:07.889 --> 04:09.665
- What?
- You don't have to win today,

04:09.666 --> 04:12.501
you just have to qualify,
so keep it in your pants.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.669
But I can take him!

04:13.670 --> 04:15.045
Babe, you're really good,

04:15.046 --> 04:17.565
but he's a legend for a reason.

04:18.017 --> 04:20.259
Which means if I beat him...

04:20.260 --> 04:22.386
- Val.
- Players, prepare for combat!

04:22.387 --> 04:23.512
Play it smart.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.222
He's a one man wrecking crew.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.224
And I'm a one woman army.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.310
No-no-no, that's not... th-that's not...

04:29.311 --> 04:31.729
that's not playing it smart!

04:36.943 --> 04:38.569
And with that, the
players are readied up

04:38.570 --> 04:40.571
and it's time for the battle to begin.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.965
Speedrun with an impressive triple
there, putting her on the board.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.218
Let's go, Speedrun, yeah, Speedrun!

05:02.219 --> 05:03.427
Crowd might be here for Killohertz

05:03.428 --> 05:06.263
but they're giving
some love to Speedrun.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.765
But here comes Killohertz

05:07.766 --> 05:10.392
with an incredible cross-map, nice,

05:10.393 --> 05:12.478
and he's taking a moment
to high-five the fans.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.188
The crowd is loving it and so is he.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.815
He's taking his eyes off the screen...

05:15.816 --> 05:17.149
Boom, unbelievable.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.528
A no-look execution;
This man is unstoppable.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.154
This match is not over yet

05:22.155 --> 05:24.031
but Speedrun is running out of time.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.536
Speedrun and Killohertz
running away from the pack.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.954
These two are dominating.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.372
The match comes down to these two,

05:31.373 --> 05:32.957
up-and-comer versus seasoned vet,

05:32.958 --> 05:34.750
and the score is tied at 24.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.794
The next kill wins the game.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.006
It's all over, what an upset!

05:41.007 --> 05:43.175
Speedrun has victory in her sights!

05:46.471 --> 05:48.681
Wha... wait, what is she doing?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.808
My God, she's gonna
go for the glory kill.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.643
She's seen Killohertz and she's gonna

05:52.644 --> 05:54.728
chase after him instead!

05:54.729 --> 05:56.313
Speedrun just had him in her sights.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.194
She's rounding the corner,
looking for the kill.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.484
He's not there...

06:00.485 --> 06:03.960
my God, Killohertz
reads Speedrun like a book.

06:03.985 --> 06:05.465
What an ending!

06:06.533 --> 06:07.741
That is one for the highlight reel.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.785
Another amazing match
win for Killohertz.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.287
This guy is great.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.496
You had him!

06:13.999 --> 06:15.165
That's the match.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.917
Moving on to the
finals are Val Hernandez

06:16.918 --> 06:18.461
and Roy Torvald.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.171
How the hell did he do that?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.965
Nobody is that good, nobody.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.049
I know, it's almost like

06:24.050 --> 06:26.279
he's a one man wrecking
crew or something.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.221
Um, but... but congrats, babe,

06:29.222 --> 06:31.271
you made it to finals.

06:31.296 --> 06:32.933
Come on.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.852
You had an amazing game, babe.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.926
Yeah, but it wasn't good enough, was it?

06:37.506 --> 06:38.772
He wrecked me today.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.316
He'll wreck me tomorrow too.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.234
Woo!

06:42.235 --> 06:43.898
Hey.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.705
There she is.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.428
GG, Speedrun.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.034
I had you, man.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.026
Of course you did.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.171
Well, keep her warm
for me, all right, son?

07:05.175 --> 07:08.261
Woo, this guy looks
like he wants a selfie.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.722
What a dick, right?

07:11.723 --> 07:14.984
You gotta get in here and
crush that turd bucket tomorrow.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.581
Smooches?

07:20.732 --> 07:23.067
You're a dork, Evan.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.943
A sexy dork?

07:27.405 --> 07:29.198
That's more like it.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.116
Okay, I'm gonna go grab my car.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.395
Good game today.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.790
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

07:37.815 --> 07:40.177
Sucks you're gonna lose tomorrow.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.336
Who the hell are you exactly?

07:42.337 --> 07:43.420
Your fairy godmother.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.755
Here, hold this.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.217
You know, you're pretty good, Speedrun.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.468
Now you got guts

07:49.469 --> 07:51.553
but if you wanna win tomorrow,

07:51.554 --> 07:53.138
you're gonna need some help.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.437
K... Ko-ji... Ko-ji-ma?

08:00.438 --> 08:01.816
"Ko-jee-ma."

08:01.909 --> 08:04.024
You know, you're right about Roy.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.919
Nobody's that good.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.614
All right, dude,
what... what's your deal?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.116
What the hell is this?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.535
Call first, I got a lot goin' on.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.073
How was the interview?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.259
Fine.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.385
It was fine.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.730
You wanna try that again?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.557
Pedro called.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.741
You didn't even show up today.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.977
I was feeling woozy.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.104
I was gonna call in sick and...

08:42.105 --> 08:43.981
Grandma.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.483
I almost lost my job
today picking her up.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.359
Now what the hell happened?

08:48.439 --> 08:50.029
There was a tournament today.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.948
It was a big one, I...
I couldn't just miss it.

08:52.973 --> 08:55.183
I didn't win but I played amazing.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.875
Well, congratulations.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.328
I hope you had fun because tomorrow

08:58.329 --> 08:59.538
you're going down to your uncle's

08:59.539 --> 09:00.748
and you're gonna beg for an interview.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.916
No, I can't, tomorrow's the finals.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.251
Absolutely not.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.836
Dad!

09:05.837 --> 09:07.918
This is my dream.

09:08.325 --> 09:11.341
Is this about the money,
because first prize is ten grand.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.010
I mean, what does that
stupid job pay anyway?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.596
It's not about the money, Val.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.598
And you lied to me.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.434
I trusted you and you
completely let me down.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.144
Look, I know you have dreams, mija.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.518
I want you to achieve them.

09:24.543 --> 09:27.775
But I also want you to be a good person.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.588
I mean, do you think
about anybody but yourself?

09:32.197 --> 09:33.530
Yeah, I do actually.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.949
I think about you and I
think about your crappy job

09:35.950 --> 09:38.494
and your crappy life and then I think,

09:38.495 --> 09:39.787
"I want to do the opposite."

09:39.788 --> 09:41.538
Valerie, thin ice.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.875
No wonder Mom left.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.896
I'll tell you one thing,
the fans cannot wait

10:05.897 --> 10:08.273
to see these two go
toe-to-toe again tomorrow.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.685
I said to call.

11:00.725 --> 11:02.828
Come on, follow me.

11:03.878 --> 11:06.623
Okay, I'm not quite sure why I'm here,

11:06.624 --> 11:08.580
but, you know, you said
you could help, so...

11:08.605 --> 11:09.936
Play.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.444
Why?

11:20.138 --> 11:21.513
Thanks?

11:22.807 --> 11:24.558
Okay.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.818
Okay.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.989
- Game start.
- _.

11:45.624 --> 11:47.310
Game over.

11:48.385 --> 11:50.000
Well, that sucked.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.085
Try it with this.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.339
An energy drink?

11:55.340 --> 11:56.506
Seriously?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.266
Yup.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.372
Just a normal, ordinary,
nothing special about it,

12:09.397 --> 12:11.021
energy drink.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.360
Kanpai.

12:53.698 --> 12:56.359
Good, you're back.

12:57.425 --> 12:59.442
Wh... what happened?

12:59.467 --> 13:02.739
When you drink Impulse
9, you're stretching time.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.408
The harder you stretch...

13:06.077 --> 13:07.744
the harder you snap back.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.270
This time you lost about an hour.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.709
It's like being blackout
drunk, minus the drunk part.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.752
Holy shit.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.921
$500 a bottle, Speedrun.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.644
That is...

13:19.669 --> 13:20.924
all my money.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.136
Plus 6.50 for the ramen.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.929
Wait, no, I can't.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.516
I mean, it's wrong,
it's cheating, isn't it?

13:29.758 --> 13:31.643
It's definitely cheating.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.769
But is it wrong?

13:36.566 --> 13:38.949
Roy doesn't seem to think so.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.982
Hey, bro, what's up?

13:41.109 --> 13:43.280
What's that, another case of Impulse

13:43.281 --> 13:44.656
for the match tomorrow?

13:44.657 --> 13:45.741
You got it.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.993
Cash only, ATM's in the front.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.597
Yeah, I'm still here.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.285
Nope, nobody you know.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.386
Welcome to the final round

14:06.387 --> 14:08.722
of the Chino Hills Field
of Fire Regional Tournament.

14:08.723 --> 14:09.806
In just a few moments

14:09.807 --> 14:12.059
we will crown one gamer the champion.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.609
Don't worry, babe...

14:30.995 --> 14:33.455
there's plenty of me to go around.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.303
Go, Speedrun.

14:35.328 --> 14:36.708
Yeah, Speedrun.

15:26.912 --> 15:29.219
Now Speedrun Hernandez is on fire.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.637
She's having the game of her life

15:30.638 --> 15:32.764
but, unfortunately, it's just not enough

15:32.765 --> 15:34.850
to catch our leader, Torvald.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.519
Damn, that guy is impossibly good.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.120
What?!

16:43.794 --> 16:45.337
Speedrun!

17:13.589 --> 17:15.407
What the hell?

17:22.165 --> 17:23.500
Honey?

17:23.501 --> 17:24.876
We gotta get ready, come on.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.419
Come on, I'll take her.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.368
Mommy?

17:41.811 --> 17:43.353
What?!

17:44.022 --> 17:45.438
I can't...

17:47.358 --> 17:49.053
Good morning, Mom!

17:50.486 --> 17:52.040
Ew!

17:54.574 --> 17:56.597
Hey, are you okay?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.337
You're not pregnant again, are you?

17:59.362 --> 18:01.196
Out, I need out.

18:01.221 --> 18:03.347
Wait... hey, Val, wait!

18:03.499 --> 18:04.749
Val!

18:18.848 --> 18:21.516
You forgot your gas mask,
sweetie, here you go.

18:22.170 --> 18:25.343
Come on, kids, it's time for school!

18:29.442 --> 18:31.818
_

18:33.154 --> 18:35.238
So I'll be scavenging
the wastelands until four

18:35.239 --> 18:36.698
then I gotta chop
wood for the bug roast.

18:36.699 --> 18:39.469
You think you could pick up the
kids before gate duty tonight?

18:39.494 --> 18:41.411
- Val?
- Sure.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.246
Look, Daddy, I found a neat rock!

18:43.247 --> 18:45.248
No, no, that's a poop,
sweetie, put that back.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.625
No, I want it!

18:46.626 --> 18:47.959
Tell you what, you give that to Mom,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.414
you can have it back after school, okay?

18:49.438 --> 18:50.546
- Okay.
- All right.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.631
There you go, Mommy... Mommy?

18:52.632 --> 18:53.757
There we are.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.008
Okay.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.593
All right, kids.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.303
Have a good day.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.471
Hi, guys!

18:59.472 --> 19:01.598
Hi, now take your seats, go on.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.309
Okay, what do you do when
you see a Death Lizard?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.478
Run and hide!

19:06.479 --> 19:09.158
Shoot, I'm gonna be late.

19:09.193 --> 19:10.777
Evan, I need to talk to you.

19:10.802 --> 19:12.442
Okay, quick, what's up?

19:12.443 --> 19:13.777
Sheriff Val, did you hear?

19:13.778 --> 19:15.487
- Sheriff?
- Jana's husband

19:15.488 --> 19:16.488
snapped back last night.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.781
- What?
- Yeah, right in the middle

19:17.782 --> 19:19.240
of hanky-panky... I mean,
eight years of marriage

19:19.241 --> 19:20.784
just... woo, push, goodbye.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.535
- Unbelievable.
- Can you believe it?

19:22.536 --> 19:23.995
Oy, get back here!

19:23.996 --> 19:25.830
Look.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.915
Let's go, let's go.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.291
Let's go, now!

19:28.292 --> 19:30.960
Sheriff, Sheriff, caught
myself a no-good 'Pulser.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.504
What's going on, who are you people?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.673
What... why is it the apocalypse?

19:34.674 --> 19:35.965
I'll tell you why it's the apocalypse.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.301
It's because thoughtless
slackers like you

19:38.302 --> 19:40.679
chugged too much Impulse
and when you snapped back,

19:40.680 --> 19:42.222
the world went to shit, that's why.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.474
I was... I was studying for finals.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.850
"I was studying for fi..."

19:45.851 --> 19:47.394
That's what the president
said when he snapped back

19:47.395 --> 19:48.687
with his finger on the
button, you piece...

19:48.688 --> 19:51.277
Okay, walk it off.

19:52.397 --> 19:53.650
What do you want from me?

19:53.651 --> 19:55.235
Can you dress a wound?

19:55.236 --> 19:56.986
Can you fix a generator?

19:56.987 --> 19:59.823
Can you fend off a Death Lizard?

19:59.824 --> 20:01.074
No.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.826
Then we got no place for you here.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.244
Ain't that right, Sheriff?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.580
Sheriff?

20:07.581 --> 20:08.998
You all right?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.225
Yeah.

20:12.792 --> 20:14.379
Send him away.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.005
- Send me away?
- Let's go, pal, let's go!

20:16.006 --> 20:17.507
No, don't send me away!

20:17.508 --> 20:19.592
No, where are you taking me?!

20:21.512 --> 20:23.680
Where's my mom?!

20:23.681 --> 20:25.140
Did I pass chem?

20:25.141 --> 20:27.392
Anyway... hi.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.129
What did you wanna tell me earlier?

20:31.021 --> 20:32.313
Nothing.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.886
Are you okay, you seem
a little off your game.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.193
I... I think I'm a little sick.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.987
You know, I think I
might have a stomach ache.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.113
Yeah, I feel ya.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.322
I don't think I cooked those beetles

20:41.323 --> 20:43.366
all the way through last night.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.702
- Good luck out there.
- What do I do with this?!

20:45.703 --> 20:46.995
God!

20:46.996 --> 20:49.080
Waste of a pointy stick if you ask me.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.708
Have a good day, honey.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.182
Smooches?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.420
Looks like

20:55.421 --> 20:57.019
we're in for some weather.

20:58.112 --> 21:00.383
See you at home, I love you!

21:14.191 --> 21:15.565
My God.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.984
My God, wake up, my God.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.652
What do I know about babies?

21:19.653 --> 21:20.737
I don't know anything about babies.

21:20.738 --> 21:21.988
You're not my baby.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.406
You're not!

21:28.078 --> 21:29.204
You're my baby.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.041
What is happening?

21:33.042 --> 21:35.084
What is happening, what is happening?

21:36.378 --> 21:38.588
Dad, I need Dad, I need Dad.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.428
My God.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.847
Dad?

21:51.212 --> 21:52.910
_

22:15.125 --> 22:16.918
You've got this, Val.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.126
You're a bad-ass bitch.

22:19.732 --> 22:21.464
I need you right now.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.051
Keep it together.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.063
Sheriff?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.100
Sheriff, let's go!

22:34.824 --> 22:38.744
Tick-tock, we're late for latrine duty.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.526
Latrine duty?

22:41.527 --> 22:44.571
As in... scrubbing toilets.

22:44.596 --> 22:48.123
Hey, if you can call 'em that.

22:48.148 --> 22:49.784
But I'm... the sheriff?

22:49.785 --> 22:50.994
I'm the sheriff.

22:50.995 --> 22:54.122
Yeah, and sanitation commissioner

22:54.123 --> 22:56.666
and a scavenger and a mom.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.793
Hey, you got a lot going on,

22:58.794 --> 23:01.549
so shake a leg.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.925
Or do I have to toss you
out into the wasteland?

23:15.686 --> 23:17.854
- I'm gonna go get ready.
- All right, Sheriff.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.230
Come on, let's go.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.524
- Couple minutes.
- All right.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.686
Bye.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.451
Sheriff!

24:13.452 --> 24:14.610
Open up!

24:52.074 --> 24:54.117
How was your day, Mom?

24:54.118 --> 24:55.493
Fine.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.953
It was fine.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.488
Look, Mommy, I made this for you.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.416
Great.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.769
At least it's not a dog turd.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.343
Hey, Mom, did you know
the green thing in plants

25:12.344 --> 25:13.803
is this stuff called chlorophyll?

25:13.804 --> 25:16.848
Yup, I sure did... look,
Mommy's really tired

25:16.849 --> 25:18.307
and she needs to get some sleep

25:18.308 --> 25:20.785
before her 5-hour guard duty,

25:20.810 --> 25:24.480
so if you two could just...
pipe down, it'd be...

25:31.155 --> 25:33.948
Guess what, kids, it's...

25:33.949 --> 25:36.075
- Game night!
- Game night!

25:36.076 --> 25:37.577
Play Field of Fire with us!

25:37.578 --> 25:40.329
No, you leave Mommy
alone, she needs a nap.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.165
She'll play with you
next month, okay, buddy?

25:42.166 --> 25:43.583
Next month?

25:45.502 --> 25:48.504
I, could play one round.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.048
I mean, for them.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.591
"For them," right.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.717
Be sure to grab some sleep

25:52.718 --> 25:55.178
before you gotta go on guard duty, okay?

25:55.179 --> 25:56.554
Yup, yup.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.805
I'm off to the bug roast.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.348
- Have fun!
- Okay.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.683
Bye, kids.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.322
Go, Speedrun, go!

26:14.323 --> 26:16.332
Go, Speedrun, go!

26:17.326 --> 26:18.868
Not bad for an old lady?

26:18.869 --> 26:20.870
That was awesome, how are you so good?

26:20.871 --> 26:23.498
Mommy, can you teach me
how to play like that?

26:23.499 --> 26:25.166
Hell yes I can.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.834
Come here, take a seat.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.308
Sit here.

26:29.963 --> 26:33.049
Okay, first we gotta learn the basics.

26:35.886 --> 26:38.346
Okay, that's it, th... that's it.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.264
- You got it, you got it.
- Okay, you got it, you got it.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.016
Wait-wait-wait, reload, reload, reload.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.519
- Come on, reload, yes!
- Val!

26:44.520 --> 26:45.561
Val?

26:47.231 --> 26:49.065
- Thank God.
- Shit!

26:49.066 --> 26:50.650
Okay, kids, I gotta go, all right,

26:50.651 --> 26:51.901
but keep practicing.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.189
Okay.

26:53.214 --> 26:54.987
Hey, hey.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.948
Where have you been?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.324
I've been looking all over for you.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.756
- What's wrong?
- Come on.

27:00.781 --> 27:02.245
It's Dan.

27:02.246 --> 27:05.289
He was pounding on the gate
and a Death Lizard came.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.481
And you weren't there to let him in.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.343
How could you?!

27:20.639 --> 27:23.099
It was game night.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.842
No, Val, wait.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.486
You still need to finish your shift.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.268
Hi.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.699
Hi.

28:10.314 --> 28:13.066
Come to bed, hon, you
got work in the morning.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.142
I can't do this, Evan.

28:20.235 --> 28:23.826
We toil and suffer all day

28:23.827 --> 28:26.996
and if we take an extra
second for ourselves,

28:26.997 --> 28:31.334
a damn minute for a moment of peace,

28:31.335 --> 28:33.711
someone else might die?

28:33.712 --> 28:37.171
I mean... what the hell is the point?

28:38.842 --> 28:40.378
Why even bother?

28:47.893 --> 28:49.393
Val.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.801
For 12 years,

28:51.826 --> 28:54.190
you have been an amazing wife,

28:54.191 --> 28:56.751
you're an incredible mother.

28:57.402 --> 29:01.197
You are the most
fearless and thoughtful,

29:01.198 --> 29:03.449
responsible person I know.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.535
No I'm not.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.956
Yeah.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.419
Hey.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.468
One mistake doesn't change all that.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.347
Look, I could give you a speech
about why we do what we do

29:26.348 --> 29:28.599
and why we work so hard but...

29:28.600 --> 29:29.892
it'd just be words right now.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.706
You have to figure
that out for yourself.

29:32.731 --> 29:34.563
And I know that you will.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.112
I love you.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.789
Come to bed.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.396
I'll be right there.

30:37.419 --> 30:38.670
Babe?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.110
Honey?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.225
"Dear Evan..."

30:53.226 --> 30:56.187
"By the time you read
this, I'll be gone."

30:56.188 --> 30:59.099
"It pains me to leave
you and the kids, but..."

30:59.124 --> 31:01.192
"I've been living a lie."

31:02.593 --> 31:05.328
"I'm not the woman you married anymore."

31:05.864 --> 31:08.199
"I'm a 'Pulser."

31:08.200 --> 31:12.120
"You remember that FPS tournament
where I beat Roy Torvald?"

31:12.621 --> 31:15.039
"That was last Tuesday."

31:15.040 --> 31:17.166
"I thought I could hide."

31:17.167 --> 31:19.251
"I thought I could hack it."

31:19.252 --> 31:21.796
"But after last night, it's clear to me"

31:21.797 --> 31:25.007
"why you send us 'Pulsers
to the wastes to die."

31:26.843 --> 31:28.844
"There's just no place
in civilized society"

31:28.845 --> 31:32.577
"for a teenage kid trapped
in a grown-up's body,"

31:32.602 --> 31:34.850
"so I'm leaving."

31:34.851 --> 31:38.058
"Maybe I'll find another
bottle of Impulse out there."

31:38.083 --> 31:40.022
"But whatever I find,"

31:40.023 --> 31:44.424
"whatever this crazy, mixed-up
world has in store for me,"

31:44.528 --> 31:46.113
"I want you to know that I always..."

31:47.364 --> 31:49.611
Jesus Christ, Val.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.464
It's hot.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.551
So hot.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.261
What was I thinking?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.310
No way.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.470
Hey!

32:52.929 --> 32:54.630
Speedrun?

32:54.931 --> 32:56.223
Kojima?

32:56.224 --> 32:58.434
You look rough.

32:58.435 --> 33:01.641
You look... exactly the same.

33:02.606 --> 33:03.939
What the hell did you do?

33:03.940 --> 33:06.984
Well, solar panels
keep this place going.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.781
As for me, let's just
say I have my ways.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.751
So what brings you back
to my neck of the woods?

33:14.784 --> 33:18.954
I... got kicked out of my suburb.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.548
Well, that sucks.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.375
Wait a minute...

33:23.376 --> 33:25.170
did you just snap back?

33:26.796 --> 33:28.131
Last week.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.050
Damn, girl, how much did you do?

33:31.051 --> 33:32.903
You think this is funny?

33:33.220 --> 33:36.056
Your drink ruined my life!

33:38.266 --> 33:40.142
Yeah, we kinda ruined a lot of lives.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.144
- Yeah.
- I know.

33:42.145 --> 33:44.888
Um, I'll tell ya what, though.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.233
I get a lot of 'Pulsers in here, okay?

33:47.234 --> 33:49.109
Some of them are old clients,

33:49.110 --> 33:50.986
some of 'em got it somewhere else,

33:50.987 --> 33:52.821
but I tell them all the same thing.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.086
Now...

33:54.741 --> 33:57.666
I don't do refunds, but...

33:58.625 --> 34:01.312
I can give you store credit.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.499
Are you insane?

34:03.500 --> 34:06.335
Dude, it sucks out there, man.

34:06.336 --> 34:08.003
Life is hard and short

34:08.004 --> 34:10.672
and death is usually slow and painful.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.550
Or... chug this bad boy,

34:13.551 --> 34:14.885
sidle up to your favorite game,

34:14.886 --> 34:17.429
and go out doing what you love.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.850
And what happens when I snap back?

34:21.851 --> 34:23.811
That's best part.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.187
You won't.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.681
Unless you live to be, like, 103.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.443
So what do you think?

34:43.373 --> 34:45.248
Do you have Field of Fire?

34:47.268 --> 34:48.918
This way.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.098
Speedrun.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.563
See you on the other side.

35:28.084 --> 35:31.253
Look, Mommy, I made this for you.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.088
At least it's not a dog turd.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.224
I mean, do you think
about anybody but yourself?

35:38.304 --> 35:40.567
No wonder Mom left.

35:40.607 --> 35:44.433
You are the most
fearless and thoughtful,

35:44.434 --> 35:46.685
responsible person I know.

35:48.021 --> 35:50.022
I could give you a speech
about why we do what we do

35:50.023 --> 35:52.066
and why we work so hard but...

35:52.067 --> 35:54.234
you have to figure
that out for yourself.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.155
And I know that you will.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.808
What?

36:17.467 --> 36:18.634
Hello?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.763
Hello!

36:24.599 --> 36:25.933
Evan!

36:29.396 --> 36:30.979
Evan!

36:30.980 --> 36:32.815
Screw you, Val, get outta here!

36:32.816 --> 36:34.483
No, Evan, please, wait!

36:34.484 --> 36:37.236
- I... I just wanna talk.
- Bullshit, Val!

36:37.237 --> 36:38.570
You just know it sucks out there

36:38.571 --> 36:40.322
and now you want back in.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.908
No, no, I did... it's not...

36:42.909 --> 36:44.743
I do want back in, I do,

36:44.744 --> 36:46.870
but it's not because it sucks out here.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.956
Goodbye, Val!

37:07.016 --> 37:10.662
It's not about what
we get for ourselves.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.188
It's about what we give each other.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.943
I wanna be that
person... in that drawing.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.445
I wanna be that.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.531
You gotta understand,

37:22.532 --> 37:25.409
a week ago I was 19, I was kissing you

37:25.410 --> 37:26.577
at a tournament.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.011
I...

37:29.330 --> 37:31.790
I'm new at this, okay?

37:31.791 --> 37:33.751
But I wanna make it work.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.461
I'll... I'll... I'll...

37:35.462 --> 37:36.587
I'll scrub toilets,

37:36.588 --> 37:37.963
I'll do guard duty,

37:37.964 --> 37:39.214
I'll do double shifts.

37:39.215 --> 37:42.471
I'll do whatever it
takes to make it work.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.553
But I can't do it alone.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.224
Do you have any idea what it's like

37:49.225 --> 37:53.312
for 12 years of marriage
to disappear in an instant?

37:53.313 --> 37:54.563
No.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.984
I don't even know how you proposed.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.444
Are you kidding?

38:00.445 --> 38:01.528
You proposed to me.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.976
It was the best day of my life, Val.

38:04.987 --> 38:06.738
We can start over.

38:06.763 --> 38:07.993
Evan.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.176
I mean...

38:11.748 --> 38:14.663
it's not like it's the end of the world.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.755
The hell is that?

38:21.883 --> 38:24.218
- Death Lizards!
- They're people?!

38:24.219 --> 38:26.220
No, Val, they're giant
radioactive lizards.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.983
Of course they're people.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.098
Sound the alarm!

38:31.351 --> 38:33.185
I got the gate, go get the kids.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.236
Come on, everybody, get
the supplies, we gotta go!

38:42.237 --> 38:43.862
- Where, where are we going?
- To the ravine.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.572
But we can't go out
there, it's hell outside.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.032
Well, we have to.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.785
Our deputy's dead and our
sheriff is an Impulse junkie.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.328
They're gonna knock down this gate

38:51.329 --> 38:53.455
and then they're gonna kill
everybody who's left inside,

38:53.456 --> 38:54.915
so we have to go now.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.725
But this is our home.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.837
Not anymore.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.304
- Kids!
- Max!

39:09.305 --> 39:10.597
- Go with your mom.
- Sophia, come here.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.015
Come with Mommy, it's okay, it's okay.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.434
Be careful, stay... stay by the wall.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.769
All right, stay with Mommy.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.896
Stay with Mommy, it's
okay, it's all right.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.231
It's okay.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.572
- Come on, come on.
- Sheriff, we can't outrun them,

39:26.573 --> 39:28.073
it's hopeless, we're all gonna die!

39:28.074 --> 39:29.324
That's not true, is it, Mommy?

39:29.325 --> 39:31.285
No, no, no, of course not.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.953
You're with Mommy, it's okay, all right?

39:39.168 --> 39:40.568
Val!

39:41.087 --> 39:42.957
Come on, kids, come on.

39:42.982 --> 39:44.840
Hey, you guys.

39:44.841 --> 39:45.966
Guys.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.175
Val!

39:47.176 --> 39:49.011
You have to listen to
your dad, all right?

39:49.012 --> 39:50.512
Okay, promise me?

39:50.513 --> 39:51.930
Okay.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.223
All right.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.350
- Go.
- Let's go!

39:55.351 --> 39:58.103
- Come on, Sophia.
- Good girl, good girl.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.271
Val?

40:00.982 --> 40:02.316
Head for the ravine,
you'll be safe there.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.776
- What are you doing?
- My job.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.570
I'll hold them off for as long as I can.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.863
I'll send a flare when it's safe.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.740
You don't have to do this.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.413
I love you.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.081
Go, go!

40:18.082 --> 40:19.458
Go!

41:09.258 --> 41:10.676
This is it?

41:10.677 --> 41:12.344
One lousy bitch?

41:18.768 --> 41:20.102
Roy?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.854
I was wondering what
kind of idiot stands

41:22.855 --> 41:26.233
in the middle of town square
like a wannabe bad-ass.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.151
But duh!

41:28.152 --> 41:29.936
Speedrun.

41:29.961 --> 41:31.613
Last chance, Roy.

41:31.614 --> 41:34.616
You need to crawl back to
whatever hole you came out of.

41:35.785 --> 41:38.328
That's not how it works, Speedrun.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.889
It works like this.

41:40.248 --> 41:42.363
First we're gonna kill you...

41:42.875 --> 41:44.767
and then we're gonna eat you...

41:44.792 --> 41:46.628
and then we're gonna pay a little visit

41:46.629 --> 41:49.023
to that ravine over
there where your family

41:49.048 --> 41:50.650
thinks they're hiding out

41:50.675 --> 41:52.551
and we're gonna kill them

41:52.593 --> 41:54.779
then we're gonna eat them too.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.722
How many kids you got, Speedrun?

41:58.474 --> 42:01.018
Judging by that body it's
gotta be more than one.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.301
You're a monster.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.572
What can I say,

42:06.598 --> 42:08.567
wasteland changed me.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.824
Yeah, changed me too.
