WEBVTT

00:04.037 --> 00:07.040
Henri insisted
I show it to you first

00:07.040 --> 00:09.076
before it's in any stores.

00:09.076 --> 00:12.012
Whoo-hoo.
(Laughs) Naughty.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.113
(Chuckles)

00:13.113 --> 00:14.114
Pass.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.015
Oh.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.084
Go.

00:17.084 --> 00:21.021
From salon de gorgeous...

00:21.021 --> 00:22.089
(Letitia) Oh.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.992
Oh.

00:24.992 --> 00:28.028
Oh. Thrilling.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.997
Pass.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.098
Are you gonna say no
to everything I like?

00:32.098 --> 00:34.034
Ding, ding, ding.

00:34.034 --> 00:38.038
No one wants to buy lingerie
their mother approves of.

00:38.038 --> 00:42.075
I'm sorry, Adrian.
I'm just--I'm not feeling it.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.013
What's the matter with you?

00:46.013 --> 00:48.015
Nothing. I guess...

00:48.015 --> 00:50.083
I guess when I--
when I buy underwear,

00:50.083 --> 00:52.085
I just need to have
someone in mind.

00:52.085 --> 00:55.022
And well, mom,
let's face it,

00:55.022 --> 00:57.124
after four failed marriages--
four--and oh, oh,

00:57.124 --> 01:00.027
and a failed wedding
where I was traded for stock--

01:00.027 --> 01:02.095
nonsense. You're--you're
momentarily unhappy.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.096
And why wouldn't you be?

01:04.096 --> 01:07.067
Oh, I can't tell you
the number of times

01:07.067 --> 01:09.036
I've been disappointed by men.

01:09.036 --> 01:11.038
Mm.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.007
But do you know
what never lets me down,

01:14.007 --> 01:15.075
not ever?

01:15.075 --> 01:18.011
Oh, oh, oh, well,
if it has batteries, mom,

01:18.011 --> 01:20.013
I'd really rather not.

01:20.013 --> 01:23.016
Oh, no. I'm talking
about you, dear.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.052
Aw. (Chuckles)

01:25.052 --> 01:28.021
You and my other
wonderful children--

01:28.021 --> 01:30.123
you are the great joys
of my life.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.993
Oh.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.996
Someday you'll know
what I mean.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.064
(Man) Children!

01:37.064 --> 01:38.999
(School bell rings)

01:38.999 --> 01:41.001
Children, line up.
Come on, everybody.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.004
Let's go. Let's go.
Shake a leg. Shake a leg.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.072
(Car horn honks)

01:45.072 --> 01:47.007
(Nick) Hey! Hey.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.076
Mr. George.
Here it is.
Here it is. I made it.

01:49.076 --> 01:52.045
Uh, Mr. George?
Yeah, I forgot
Kiki's permission slip

01:52.045 --> 01:54.114
when I dropped her off
yesterday, for the field trip.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.049
Your wife called and said

01:56.049 --> 01:59.052
Kiki wouldn't be coming
to school today.
What?

01:59.052 --> 02:01.054
Hi, Mr. George.
Hey, Molly.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.091
Where's Kiki?
Uh, I'm trying to
figure that out right now.

02:04.091 --> 02:07.027
Uh, when--when did my wife call
and say this?
This morning.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.062
She said they were gone
for the weekend.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.064
Is there a problem?

02:11.064 --> 02:12.099
(Sighs)

02:12.099 --> 02:15.002
(Keypad beeps,
cell phone rings)

02:15.002 --> 02:17.037
The problem?

02:17.037 --> 02:20.107
The problem is that you didn't
tell me you were taking her.
It was a last-minute thing,
Nick.

02:20.107 --> 02:23.043
This client called
out of the blue.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.078
It's a beautiful house
right on the beach.

02:25.078 --> 02:28.081
I'm going to select
some art pieces--
look, I don't care if you're
painting them yourself

02:28.081 --> 02:31.084
with finger paints, Lisa,
you can't kidnap our daughter.
I am not having
this conversation.

02:31.084 --> 02:34.087
You are obviously insane. I will
have her back to you on Monday.
On Monday?
This is my weekend, Lisa.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.123
We made an agreement.
(Cell phone beeps)

02:36.123 --> 02:38.992
Lisa? Lisa?!

02:38.992 --> 02:40.093
(Beep)

02:40.093 --> 02:42.095
It feels pretty homey.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.097
I mean, I've only
been here a day,

02:44.097 --> 02:47.067
but I'm already getting
the sense that, um,

02:47.067 --> 02:49.069
this is where I belong.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.071
(Tripp)
That's so wonderful, son.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.106
So what can I do
for you, dad?

02:53.106 --> 02:56.076
A few years ago,

02:56.076 --> 02:59.112
we put the kibosh on
Simon elder's bio-fuel project.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.015
And now he's your partner,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.051
so his profits
are your profits.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.019
Precisely.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.021
The key to the whole business

03:08.021 --> 03:10.023
was the chairman
of the committee--

03:10.023 --> 03:11.124
a fellow named Charles Watley.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.126
Now if he could be persuaded...
(Elevator bell dings)

03:13.126 --> 03:16.096
To reverse his position,
that would be very beneficial

03:16.096 --> 03:19.032
to everybody.
I'll talk to him, dad,
but that's it.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.100
I'm not gonna push.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.069
No, no, no, no.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.071
Just feel him out,
see where he stands, you know?

03:24.071 --> 03:27.040
Yes, but I'm not
going to be unethical.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.042
I'll see what I can do.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.044
Thanks. Bye.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.112
You okay?

03:32.112 --> 03:35.115
Yeah. Uh... look,
I need to borrow a jet.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.085
Lisa took Kiki out of state
for the weekend

03:38.085 --> 03:40.988
without my permission,
without even notifying me.
Oh, wow.

03:40.988 --> 03:44.024
Yeah. So I had the GPS company
track the location of the car,

03:44.024 --> 03:47.060
and they're somewhere near
the Maryland shore.
You want to go there
and retrieve Kiki.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.030
Yeah.
Take the plane. Go.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.065
(Nick)
All right. Thanks.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.067
(Jeremy) Oh, yeah.
(Exhales deeply)

03:54.067 --> 03:57.104
That's what it takes. Whoo!
The memories are flooding back.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.107
How long do you think
you can keep this up?
All morning.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.043
Mm. I mean the amnesia act.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.112
Mm. As long as it takes
to convince Simon

04:05.112 --> 04:07.114
that I remember
absolutely nothing

04:07.114 --> 04:09.049
about how he's got

04:09.049 --> 04:11.051
your little brother
tucked away somewhere.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.053
Then I'll move in,
gain Simon's trust,

04:13.053 --> 04:16.055
get close enough to figure out
where he stashed the kid.

04:16.055 --> 04:19.059
Baby... you're not really
spy material,

04:19.059 --> 04:23.063
not to mention that Simon is
a paranoid sociopath...

04:23.063 --> 04:26.033
And that's on a good day.

04:26.033 --> 04:30.003
You're never
gonna get close to him.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.073
Unless he thinks
it's his idea.

04:33.073 --> 04:36.009
Mm.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.079
So let's make him think
it's his idea.

04:43.050 --> 04:46.019
(Nick) Here's a crazy idea...
(Clark) Hello, Mr. George.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.988
Since it's just you and me
on this trip, Clark,

04:47.988 --> 04:49.990
how about you switch
the satellite radio

04:49.990 --> 04:51.992
to something
a little less operatic?

04:51.992 --> 04:55.095
Oh, it's not just
you and me, Mr. George.
What are you talking about?

04:55.095 --> 04:58.098
I'm stowing away. What do you
want to do, listen to N. P. R.?

04:58.098 --> 05:01.101
It's not gonna happen.
Yeah? Well, I'm taking
the jet to D. C., Brian.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.071
Oh, yeah? So am I.
Yeah, for what?

05:04.071 --> 05:06.106
It's classified.
I could tell you, but...

05:06.106 --> 05:10.043
That might lead to
an actual conversation.
God forbid.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.112
Hey, Clark. Let's blow
this popsicle stand.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.015
Uh, as soon as the last
passenger boards the aircraft,

05:15.015 --> 05:17.017
Mr. Darling,
the stand will be blown.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.019
What last passenger?

05:19.019 --> 05:21.088
Hello, sailors.
Going my way? Sorry.

05:21.088 --> 05:24.024
That depends.
Where you going?
And the answer is no.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.026
Uh, little place
outside of D. C.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.128
It's, um, a boutique of sorts,
very exclusive.

05:28.128 --> 05:31.031
Yeah? What are you
shopping for, jewelry?

05:31.031 --> 05:32.065
Nope. Mnh-mnh.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.068
So... what are you
going for?

05:35.068 --> 05:36.103
Sperm.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.007
Sperm?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.074
Yeah, you heard me.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.010
Buckle up, boys.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.077
Karen Darling...

05:44.077 --> 05:47.047
(Singsong voice)
Is gonna have a baby.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.017
♪♪♪

06:00.060 --> 06:02.095
Mommy kind of gave me
the idea,

06:02.095 --> 06:05.098
and at first,
I was totally against it.

06:05.098 --> 06:09.002
I mean, baby poo
and holding... things?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.103
But once I got a physical

06:10.103 --> 06:13.106
and started doing research
on sperm and their banks,

06:13.106 --> 06:15.075
what can I say?

06:15.075 --> 06:18.011
You got sucked in?
I did.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.013
What a lovely thought,
Karen.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.082
Don't. Do not--do not try
and talk me out of this.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.117
You stopped me
from marrying Simon.

06:24.117 --> 06:28.021
Don't stop me from having coco.
(Nick and Brian) Coco?

06:28.021 --> 06:30.090
That's gonna be its name.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.092
I'm gonna pick out a donor

06:32.092 --> 06:35.996
and I'm gonna schedule a squirt
or whatever it is they call it.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.097
Support me, people. Come on.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.099
Well, I want to, Karen. I do.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.069
I just think that...
You with a kid?

06:42.069 --> 06:45.105
Oh, yeah, like you have anything
to teach anyone about parenting?

06:45.105 --> 06:48.075
Don't start with me, Brian.
The minute you and Lisa
broke up,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.077
you should've gone
to the authorities

06:50.077 --> 06:53.080
and accused her of child abuse
and loose living.
It's true.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.115
Well, that wouldn't
have been true.
You know, so what?

06:55.115 --> 06:58.085
At least you wouldn't be
on this mission,

06:58.085 --> 07:01.021
going to kidnap
your own kid back.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.090
When it comes to kids, Nick,
you gotta play dirty.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.092
Well, thanks for
the advice, padre.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.095
Hey, what are you going
to D. C. For anyway?

07:10.030 --> 07:14.034
Well... you know,
if you two need to know...

07:14.034 --> 07:17.104
I'm giving a benediction

07:17.104 --> 07:20.107
for a state dinner
that Patrick's hosting.
(Thud, metal clattering)

07:20.107 --> 07:23.010
Sorry about that, folks.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.078
We're heading into
a little bit of chop.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.047
It should even out in no time.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.049
Wait, Tripp isn't going
to paddy's dinner?

07:29.049 --> 07:32.019
That seems kind of odd
for him.
Well, I guess paddy

07:32.019 --> 07:34.021
wants everyone to
stay the hell out of it

07:34.021 --> 07:36.123
and maybe mind
their own business maybe.
(Metal rattles)

07:36.123 --> 07:39.092
Okay. Okay, okay.
That can't be good, can it?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.995
Hey, Brian,
my guess is that God feels

07:41.995 --> 07:44.064
the same way about you
that everyone else does.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.067
But just in case he's, like,
a big-picture kinda guy,

07:47.067 --> 07:50.037
maybe you could just
toss out a prayer.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.072
No, I am not gonna pray
to God for protection

07:52.072 --> 07:54.074
from a world
that he made dangerous.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.043
Just tough it out.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.011
(Clattering)

07:58.011 --> 08:00.013
Okay, I'm gonna put
a word in, all right?

08:00.013 --> 08:03.016
So just bow
your friggin' heads.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.018
Anxious? (Laughs)
No, not at all.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.020
Because there's no reason to be.

08:07.020 --> 08:10.023
Everything's going as planned.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.092
It's not overconfidence.
It's just--

08:12.092 --> 08:15.028
hey, hey, hey.
Do not threaten me.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.031
When I have I ever given you
reason to doubt my loyalty?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.067
When have I ever--

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
okay. All right.
Okay. All right.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.006
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.008
Uh...

08:28.008 --> 08:31.011
I promise, I'll get it done.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.113
Listen, nola just arrived.
I gotta go.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.048
(Cell phone beeps)

08:40.020 --> 08:43.023
Sorry I'm late.
What's this?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.125
The minutes to
Patrick Darling's first session

08:45.125 --> 08:48.095
with the senate
agricultural committee.
How'd he do?

08:48.095 --> 08:51.131
He held his own. You'll see.
It's all in there.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.067
Whoa. Wait.
What is that?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.068
What?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.070
You have a hickey.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.079
I do.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.081
And welcome
to eighth grade.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.084
(Chuckles) Who gave it to you?
Who are you seeing?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.988
Jeremy Darling.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.025
Jeremy? Jeremy Darling
has amnesia.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.027
I thought he didn't
remember you.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.062
He didn't. He doesn't.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.064
It just so happens you two

09:24.064 --> 09:27.034
have fallen
into bed together... again?

09:27.034 --> 09:30.037
I guess
we just have chemistry.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.072
Yeah.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.074
Let's hope that's true.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.076
Because if I were
to ever find out

09:36.076 --> 09:39.079
that his amnesia was anything
less than genuine--

09:39.079 --> 09:41.114
he doesn't remember anything.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.083
Trust me.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.999
So... what can I
do for you, senator?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.101
Well, I came to speak to you

10:01.101 --> 10:03.103
about Simon elder's
bio-diesel project.

10:03.103 --> 10:07.007
Which is now a joint venture
with Darling enterprises,

10:07.007 --> 10:09.109
if I'm not mistaken.
That's correct, yes.

10:09.109 --> 10:13.013
And your father would like me
to reverse my negative position

10:13.013 --> 10:16.083
now that there's money to be
made in it for him.
That's... I'm not sure
that's how he would put it.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.019
(Chuckles) Well, of course not,
but then again,

10:19.019 --> 10:21.989
your father never says exactly
what he means, does he?

10:21.989 --> 10:24.091
Look, I'll tell you what--
why don't you tell your father,

10:24.091 --> 10:26.093
please, for me, senator,

10:26.093 --> 10:29.062
that the position that he...
Pressured me into taking

10:29.062 --> 10:30.998
all those many years ago

10:30.998 --> 10:33.033
is one I've actually
come to agree with?

10:33.033 --> 10:37.037
I will not
reverse my position.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.040
Congressman, I've looked
at the data, and you should--

10:40.040 --> 10:42.109
this meeting is over,
senator.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.112
Oh, and, uh, why don't you
tell your father for me,

10:45.112 --> 10:50.017
next time you see him--
I hope he rots in hell.

10:50.017 --> 10:53.086
(Clark) Okay,
we’ve got a problem.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.122
I'm gonna pull back
on the o'l joystick,

10:55.122 --> 10:58.025
see if we can
get up above it.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.092
Brian?

10:59.092 --> 11:02.062
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
What?! What?!

11:02.062 --> 11:04.031
He's really praying!
(Engine whines)

11:04.031 --> 11:07.067
What's that noise?
Nick, what's that sound?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.036
Clark?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.038
Can't chat, Mr. George.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.040
Sorry. Little busy here.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.109
But, uh, you should go ahead
and buckle those seat belts.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.012
(Chime dings)

11:19.012 --> 11:21.048
Sweetie... Nick, Nick--

11:21.048 --> 11:24.051
hey, Karen!
I know I said this before,

11:24.051 --> 11:26.119
but if there was ever a time
to say it again, it's now.
What, Karen?

11:26.119 --> 11:29.022
I don't know if you've ever
really believed me,

11:29.022 --> 11:31.091
but I love you, Nick.
I really do.
You gotta be kidding me.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.994
Karen.
Yeah.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.063
I don't know what in life
or just everything that has

11:36.063 --> 11:39.099
kept us and made it impossible
for us to be together,

11:39.099 --> 11:42.102
but I do know in my heart...

11:42.102 --> 11:45.005
You're the one.
You always have been.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.008
Oh, God.

11:48.008 --> 11:52.012
Oh, God!
This is it!

11:52.012 --> 11:54.114
(Air whooshing)

11:54.114 --> 11:56.049
(Whooshing stops)

11:56.049 --> 11:58.118
(Clark) Sorry about that.

11:58.118 --> 12:02.022
Got a little hairy there,
but, uh, were fine.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.092
Why don't you just, uh,
sit back, relax,

12:05.092 --> 12:07.094
enjoy the flight, and, uh,

12:07.094 --> 12:11.098
just--just go back to doing
whatever you were doing?

12:16.036 --> 12:19.006
Here you go.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.041
Okay.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.045
So...

12:25.045 --> 12:27.080
What?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.116
You were saying?

12:38.091 --> 12:41.028
Where the hell are we?

12:41.028 --> 12:43.096
We are just outside
of wilkes-barre.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.131
Pennsylvania?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.099
Yeah.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.102
Hey, get back in that cockpit
and fly us outta here.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.038
No can do, sir.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.074
The F. A. A. Has grounded
all flights into Dulles

12:54.074 --> 12:57.010
due to heavy winds.
Wind? You're afraid
of a little wind?!

12:57.010 --> 12:59.046
Just man up you big...
Sissy!

12:59.046 --> 13:01.048
Hey, it's not
his fault, Brian.

13:01.048 --> 13:04.017
Hey, what are you in such
a rush for anyway?

13:04.017 --> 13:06.053
Because I made a commitment.

13:06.053 --> 13:10.057
People are counting on me.
I care.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.059
Yeah, I have
an appointment, too,

13:12.059 --> 13:15.028
but you don't see me
throwing a hissy fit.
Well, I'd be calm, too,

13:15.028 --> 13:18.999
if I had a river of vodka
running through me.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.102
You know what?
Let's just drive.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.107
I don't see
why you get to drive.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.010
Because you drive
like grandma Darling.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.012
Yeah,
and you drive like Bo Duke.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.048
Hey, come on, Brian.
You're going 90. Slow down.
Hey, I've got places to go.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.051
So do we.
Yeah, and we'd like
to get there alive.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.120
Damn it.
What?

13:40.120 --> 13:43.090
I gotta pee.
(Tires squeal)

13:45.092 --> 13:48.028
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna bring it up...

13:48.028 --> 13:50.030
The thing you said
on the plane...

13:50.030 --> 13:52.032
Good.
About me being the one.

13:52.032 --> 13:55.035
I'm glad you're not
gonna bring it up.
I don't need to.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.104
I've heard enough declarations
of love in my life

13:57.104 --> 14:00.040
to know the real ones
from the knockoffs,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.010
and you meant it.
Look, Karen, I-I thought
the plane was going down.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.046
I know, and you spoke the truth
from your innermost heart.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.015
It was very romantic.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.017
But the question is,

14:10.017 --> 14:12.085
what are you gonna do
with all those feelings?

14:12.085 --> 14:14.087
(Cell phone ringing)

14:14.087 --> 14:15.122
Ah.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.124
Oh, tell him I said hi.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.027
Hey, Patrick. What's up?
What do you know about
congressman Charles Watley?

14:20.027 --> 14:24.031
He voted against Simon's bio-fuel
a few years back.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.066
That was before my time, pat.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.101
He really, really hates dad.
Well,
that doesn't sound unlikely.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.103
Your dad's made
his fair share of enemies.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.105
In this particular case,
I have no idea why.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.074
Listen, we're running
a little late,

14:34.074 --> 14:37.044
but we got the last rental car
and we have your minister.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.047
What are you talking about?
Brian. We've got Brian
for your dinner.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.082
What dinner?
I thought there was
supposed to be

14:42.082 --> 14:44.084
some big state dinner tonight
that he's praying at.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.055
That's news to me.
Huh. Well, I guess
I misunderstood. I'm sorry.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.091
No problem.
All right.
I'll see you later, pat.

14:54.094 --> 14:57.064
Oh, no. No way.

14:57.064 --> 15:00.067
You got five seconds to get
in the back of the car.
Get out.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.102
One... two...
Three, four, five.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.005
(Engine turns over)

15:05.005 --> 15:07.040
(Tires squeal)

15:09.042 --> 15:12.012
Hey, Jeremy.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.080
Hey.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.115
You, uh, you wanted
to see me?

15:15.115 --> 15:17.117
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Have a seat.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.087
I just wanted to talk over
a little rumor I've heard about.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.089
A rumor?

15:22.089 --> 15:25.025
Well, uh, when it comes
to gossip, I'm a bitch.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.126
Let's dish.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.128
(Laughs)
Who's it about?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.063
You.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.099
You know, your father and I
are partners now,

15:32.099 --> 15:35.002
so I hear things.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.038
He mentioned in passing
that you and nola lyons are...

15:38.038 --> 15:40.040
Having
a romantic relationship.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.108
I-is she your girlfriend,
dude?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.110
'Cause if I had known,
I would not--

15:43.110 --> 15:45.112
no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.048
She's not my girlfriend,
Jeremy,

15:48.048 --> 15:50.017
and she never would be.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.085
That's what I need
to talk to you about.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.988
I need to give you a warning.
A-about nola?

15:54.988 --> 15:56.056
Yeah.
Hit me.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.091
Jeremy,
she's a dangerous woman.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.060
How so?

16:00.060 --> 16:03.063
Well, see, now you--you don't
remember any of this,

16:03.063 --> 16:06.066
but... she's done a lot of harm
to your family, Jeremy,

16:06.066 --> 16:08.101
and I think she intends
to do more.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.004
Well, I'm--I'm listening.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.073
She got sexually involved
with you the first time

16:13.073 --> 16:15.075
in order to gain
inside information

16:15.075 --> 16:17.110
about your mother
during her trial.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.112
And now she's insinuated
herself into Patrick's life

16:19.112 --> 16:21.114
in order to gain
political leverage

16:21.114 --> 16:23.116
against your father.

16:23.116 --> 16:27.020
She's out to destroy you
and your entire family.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.089
I just thought
you should know.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.092
Um...

16:36.029 --> 16:39.032
Well, here we are--
man-seed central.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.101
This doesn't look like
the most exclusive sperm bank

16:41.101 --> 16:43.103
in the world.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.106
Trust me. I did my homework.
It's the créme de la créme...

16:46.106 --> 16:48.108
So to speak.
(Laughs)

16:48.108 --> 16:50.110
(Laughs) Wish me luck.
Good luck.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.046
(Brian) Yeah, good luck,
and make it snappy.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.015
In and out...

16:55.015 --> 16:57.050
So to speak.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.052
(Woman) Well, maybe next week
we'll try again.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.054
What the hell
is going on?

17:01.054 --> 17:04.023
Patrick called during
your little potty break,

17:04.023 --> 17:07.060
and there's
no state dinner tonight.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.063
So why are you in such a rush
to get to D. C.?

17:10.063 --> 17:13.000
Brian?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.068
My ex called.
Mei ling Hwa.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.069
About what,
child support?

17:17.069 --> 17:20.107
No.
She wants to sleep with me.

17:20.107 --> 17:25.012
It's a little last tango
in Georgetown.

17:25.012 --> 17:27.114
We broke up,
she vamoosed to Hong Kong,

17:27.114 --> 17:30.050
and--and she just wants
a little... closure.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.119
And you're gonna do it?
Why the hell wouldn't I?

17:32.119 --> 17:35.055
You just got married
to Andrea.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.058
Andrea's got nothing
to do with this.
Unbelievable.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.126
Oh, come on, Nick.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.128
You know what it's like
to be married--

17:41.128 --> 17:43.130
the soul-crushing monotony,
the routine.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.099
You've been married
for four weeks.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.036
What's up?

17:49.036 --> 17:52.039
I just poked my head
inside the bank,

17:52.039 --> 17:54.041
and it's a little, uh...
Spermy?

17:54.041 --> 17:56.076
Clinical.
It's called ambiance.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.012
I need you guys to come...

17:59.012 --> 18:01.081
With me...
Inside--in the clinic.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.115
Oh, come on.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.117
Inside the...
Come on, you, too, pokey.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.053
Come on.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.091
I want someone super special.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.060
I can't bring
just anyone's chromosomes

18:13.060 --> 18:15.095
into this family.

18:15.095 --> 18:18.031
Of course, Ms. Darling,
but as you must know,

18:18.031 --> 18:20.100
we cater to only
the most discerning clientele.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.069
Yeah, yeah, and I don't want

18:22.069 --> 18:24.071
any of these
nobel prize people either,

18:24.071 --> 18:26.006
because the--the peace--

18:26.006 --> 18:28.075
yeah, the peace, peace,
blah, blah, blah stuff,

18:28.075 --> 18:30.110
I don't want--
and no one too smart.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.112
I don't want
to breast-feed a nerd.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.015
You, um, want someone
well-rounded.

18:35.015 --> 18:37.084
Exactly. Well-rounded
and cute.

18:37.084 --> 18:39.119
Cute?

18:39.119 --> 18:43.023
What's taking
so friggin' long?

18:43.023 --> 18:44.091
Hey, back off, Brian.

18:44.091 --> 18:46.093
She's not buying
a pair of shoes here.

18:46.093 --> 18:50.063
(Whispers) Oh, God.
Do you have any particular
physical attributes in mind,

18:50.063 --> 18:51.098
Ms. Darling?

18:51.098 --> 18:54.101
Yes. I want someone who looks
good in the French designers,

18:54.101 --> 18:56.103
but who can
pull off the Italians,

18:56.103 --> 18:59.072
someone versatile.

18:59.072 --> 19:04.011
I think you're gonna need
to be a little more specific.

19:04.011 --> 19:07.080
Height, weight, eye color...
Oh, God. Okay.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.050
Um... 6'2"-ish,
between 170 and 175,

19:10.050 --> 19:13.053
dirty blond
leaning towards Sandy auburn

19:13.053 --> 19:15.055
and ixnay
on the ack-bay air-hay,

19:15.055 --> 19:17.057
because I keep a clean house.

19:19.059 --> 19:21.028
What?

19:21.028 --> 19:23.130
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't help noticing,

19:23.130 --> 19:26.099
you fit
her description perfectly.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.101
He does, doesn't he?

19:28.101 --> 19:32.005
(Retches)

19:32.005 --> 19:35.042
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I just threw up
in my mouth a little. Ahem.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.044
If you'll excuse me,

19:37.044 --> 19:40.047
I'll just go
and pull some more profiles.

19:40.047 --> 19:42.049
Excellent idea.

19:42.049 --> 19:45.085
What?
I think you need
to face the facts.

19:45.085 --> 19:47.988
What facts are those?
That you should be
my baby daddy.

19:47.988 --> 19:50.023
Me?
Yeah.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.124
No.
You.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.664
I told you, Karen,

20:02.664 --> 20:05.667
I am just not ready
to be a father again, not yet.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.669
But the baby
would be mine, Nick.

20:07.669 --> 20:09.704
You wouldn't even
have to do anything...

20:09.704 --> 20:11.606
Except sleep with me.

20:11.606 --> 20:13.675
You could make that one
little sacrifice, couldn't you?

20:13.675 --> 20:16.678
Like so many others
before you have done.
Shut up, Brian.

20:16.678 --> 20:18.713
Look, what I would
really like right now

20:18.713 --> 20:21.649
is to concentrate
on getting my own kid back.

20:21.649 --> 20:23.718
Hey, why don't you
just say it?
What?

20:23.718 --> 20:26.621
You think I'd make
a lousy mother.

20:26.621 --> 20:28.623
Because I don't
believe that?

20:28.623 --> 20:31.626
Yes, you do. I can see it
in your eyes, Nick.

20:31.626 --> 20:34.629
You know what you're doing?
You're comparing me

20:34.629 --> 20:36.698
to your precious little Lisa.
No, no, no.

20:36.698 --> 20:39.701
Uh-huh. You are.
Well, I got news for you, pal.

20:39.701 --> 20:42.637
Your precious little Lisa stole
your daughter away from you

20:42.637 --> 20:44.672
and didn't tell you,

20:44.672 --> 20:47.675
which is something that I would
never do to you.

20:47.675 --> 20:49.677
(Voice breaking) Look, I...

20:49.677 --> 20:53.715
I just want to have one pure...
Simple relationship in my life

20:53.715 --> 20:58.653
about me being my best
for someone else.

20:58.653 --> 21:01.656
And if that means it's with
someone who wears a diaper

21:01.656 --> 21:03.591
and doesn't talk English,

21:03.591 --> 21:06.628
then so be it.
(Engine clanks)

21:06.628 --> 21:09.631
(Sputtering)

21:12.600 --> 21:13.668
Damn it.

21:13.668 --> 21:15.603
What's wrong now?

21:15.603 --> 21:16.638
(Sighs)

21:16.638 --> 21:19.674
Karen's sincerity
killed the car.

21:21.676 --> 21:22.710
(Sighs)

21:22.710 --> 21:24.646
Sorry.

21:27.715 --> 21:29.651
I am tired.

21:31.686 --> 21:33.688
My toe hurts.

21:33.688 --> 21:36.658
(Patrick)
It's dead in the water, dad.

21:36.658 --> 21:38.660
I went to see Watley,
and quite frankly,

21:38.660 --> 21:41.596
he still hates your guts.
What do you mean, still?

21:41.596 --> 21:42.664
You tell me.

21:42.664 --> 21:45.633
He gave the impression
you squeezed him pretty hard.

21:45.633 --> 21:47.702
Squeezed? I never squeezed
anybody, ever--anyone.

21:47.702 --> 21:51.639
I don't want to go back to
Watley and push him on this.

21:51.639 --> 21:54.642
This is your problem.
You caused it. You fix it.

21:54.642 --> 21:58.713
Patrick, I very rarely
ask you to do anything.

21:58.713 --> 22:01.649
This is for the family,
for the company.

22:01.649 --> 22:04.686
You go back to Mr. Watley...

22:04.686 --> 22:07.655
And you get it done.

22:09.691 --> 22:11.726
Right, dad.

22:11.726 --> 22:15.697
You've never squeezed anybody.

22:15.697 --> 22:18.600
I don't know
what I was thinking.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.667
(Line disconnects)

22:19.667 --> 22:21.603
(Cell phone beeps)

22:27.675 --> 22:29.677
Our worries are over,
princess.

22:29.677 --> 22:31.679
That doesn't seem
quite likely.

22:31.679 --> 22:33.615
It is.

22:33.615 --> 22:35.617
I've got Simon
totally snowed.

22:35.617 --> 22:37.685
He is so convinced
I have amnesia,

22:37.685 --> 22:40.622
he told me about you.

22:40.622 --> 22:43.591
What about me?

22:43.591 --> 22:45.627
Your checkered past.

22:45.627 --> 22:49.664
Hey, it's nothing
I don't already know.

22:51.666 --> 22:52.700
Jeremy, it's a test.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.702
For what?
Don't you see?

22:54.702 --> 22:57.705
He's fed you information,
and now he's gonna sit back

22:57.705 --> 23:00.642
and see what you're gonna
do with it.

23:00.642 --> 23:03.678
So what am I
supposed to do with it?

23:03.678 --> 23:06.681
Well, how bad
were the things he said?
Pretty bad.

23:06.681 --> 23:09.684
Then you're gonna have to
do something pretty bad.

23:09.684 --> 23:11.686
To who?

23:11.686 --> 23:13.655
Me.

23:16.724 --> 23:19.694
Lisa, it's me.

23:19.694 --> 23:23.598
What, Nick?
I'm at a motel
just outside of D. C.,

23:23.598 --> 23:25.667
and I will be there in
the morning to pick up Kiki.

23:25.667 --> 23:28.670
I told you... I told you I would
get her back to you on Monday.

23:28.670 --> 23:31.673
Why did you come down here?
Because that wasn't
our agreement. It's my weekend.

23:31.673 --> 23:33.641
So you have to spoil hers?

23:33.641 --> 23:35.643
She is having
a great time, Nick.

23:35.643 --> 23:37.712
We went horseback riding today.
We have plans for tomorrow.

23:37.712 --> 23:39.714
Oh, I thought
you were working.

23:39.714 --> 23:41.683
I am, and then we have plans.

23:41.683 --> 23:43.685
Why are you making this
about you?

23:43.685 --> 23:45.687
I'm not. Wh--
aren't you?

23:45.687 --> 23:47.689
Aren't you feeling guilty
because you have been

23:47.689 --> 23:49.724
an absentee father
all these years,

23:49.724 --> 23:53.595
and you are trying to make up
for it with this grand gesture?

23:53.595 --> 23:55.697
Hard as it is for you to hear,
Nick, she is fine without you.

23:55.697 --> 23:58.666
She is having a great time,
so please don't ruin her weekend

23:58.666 --> 24:02.604
trying to prove to yourself
that you are a good father.

24:02.604 --> 24:03.671
(Line disconnects)

24:03.671 --> 24:05.640
(Dial tone drones)

24:05.640 --> 24:06.674
(Cell phone beeps)

24:08.643 --> 24:10.612
(Sighs)

24:10.612 --> 24:12.614
(Blackberry beeping)

24:12.614 --> 24:13.715
(Door opens and closes)

24:13.715 --> 24:15.650
What happened now?

24:15.650 --> 24:17.652
Has your wife retreated
into the caves

24:17.652 --> 24:19.654
near the border of Pakistan?

24:19.654 --> 24:21.656
(Sighs) Yeah.

24:21.656 --> 24:23.625
Hey.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.595
What happened?

24:27.595 --> 24:30.632
L-Lisa...

24:30.632 --> 24:34.602
Accused me of coming down here
because I feel guilty

24:34.602 --> 24:37.639
for not being a better father
from before the break-up.

24:37.639 --> 24:39.641
You know, she said
Kiki's fine without me.

24:39.641 --> 24:40.675
Whatever.

24:40.675 --> 24:44.679
No, not "whatever."
What did you say to her?

24:44.679 --> 24:47.682
Nothing.
What am I supposed to say?

24:47.682 --> 24:49.617
"You're a lying,
cheating bitch.

24:49.617 --> 24:51.619
"You care more about having
your own art gallery

24:51.619 --> 24:54.589
than you do about the integrity
of our relationship."

24:54.589 --> 24:56.691
I mean, there are
things you could say.

24:56.691 --> 24:59.627
She's not all wrong,
though, Brian.

24:59.627 --> 25:02.597
Ever since I started
working for the family...

25:02.597 --> 25:04.699
(Blackberry buzzing)
I've been distracted, absent.

25:04.699 --> 25:06.634
You know, just like Dutch

25:06.634 --> 25:08.670
wasn't really there for me
when I was a kid,

25:08.670 --> 25:10.672
I'm not there for Kiki,
and...

25:10.672 --> 25:12.674
(Buzz)
You know, maybe she's right.

25:12.674 --> 25:14.676
Maybe I am doing this
all for myself.

25:14.676 --> 25:17.645
Kiki is fine without me.
Better off, even.

25:17.645 --> 25:19.647
You know what? Get out.
Are you serious?

25:19.647 --> 25:21.616
I'm totally serious.
Why?

25:21.616 --> 25:23.585
Because for one,
I'm your half brother

25:23.585 --> 25:24.719
and I'm not doing you
any favors

25:24.719 --> 25:26.688
listening to this
self-pitying crap.

25:26.688 --> 25:28.690
Relationships are
a two-way street, Nick,

25:28.690 --> 25:32.660
and you are a much better father
than most.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.662
(Blackberry clatters)
And two...

25:34.662 --> 25:36.698
Yeah.

25:36.698 --> 25:40.668
I'm sex texting
with Mei ling Hwa,

25:40.668 --> 25:43.705
and... I think we're ready
to take it to the next level.

25:43.705 --> 25:46.674
(Sighs)
So just take a hike.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.645
(Blackberry buzzes)

25:50.645 --> 25:53.648
(Karen) You can sleep
on the floor.

25:53.648 --> 25:56.651
Oh, but not anywhere near
the bed because, you know,

25:56.651 --> 25:58.720
God forbid you think
an impure thought

25:58.720 --> 26:01.656
and accidentally impregnate me
with your super sperm.

26:01.656 --> 26:02.690
Karen...

26:02.690 --> 26:05.660
I just had my ass handed to me
by Lisa and Brian.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.595
For what, being superior?

26:07.595 --> 26:08.696
Come on. Move over.

26:08.696 --> 26:10.698
Being a bad father
and just...

26:10.698 --> 26:12.700
Generally sucking
at everything.
Oh.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.637
You know, I don't want
to talk about it.

26:15.637 --> 26:17.639
Cut me a break,
would you?

26:17.639 --> 26:20.675
Okay, but just this once.

26:20.675 --> 26:22.677
(Man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

26:22.677 --> 26:24.646
What are you watching?

26:24.646 --> 26:28.616
You're not a bad father.
You must know that, right?

26:28.616 --> 26:31.619
(Sighs) I don't know
what I know anymore.

26:31.619 --> 26:32.687
Well... (Sighs)
God, Nick,

26:32.687 --> 26:34.689
if the proof
is in the pudding

26:34.689 --> 26:36.624
and Kiki's the pudding,

26:36.624 --> 26:37.692
you're a great dad.

26:37.692 --> 26:39.694
Lisa didn't do that
all by herself.

26:39.694 --> 26:41.696
If you're trying to talk me

26:41.696 --> 26:43.698
into getting you pregnant
tonight...

26:43.698 --> 26:45.700
(Laughs) I'm not.
Okay.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.703
I'm not. But we could try
for a practice run.
Karen.

26:48.703 --> 26:51.639
What? We could.

26:51.639 --> 26:54.609
If you and I
are gonna be together...

26:54.609 --> 26:56.644
(Gasps)
In a good, constructive way...

26:56.644 --> 26:59.614
Oh.
I'm pretty sure
it doesn't start tonight

26:59.614 --> 27:00.715
in a motel...

27:00.715 --> 27:03.618
In a room
that smells like curry.

27:03.618 --> 27:04.652
Okay.

27:04.652 --> 27:06.721
Well, then why don't you
just sleep with me?

27:06.721 --> 27:09.657
Did you not listen
to a word I said?!

27:09.657 --> 27:11.659
I said--Nick, I said
"sleep with me,"

27:11.659 --> 27:13.661
like hold me,

27:13.661 --> 27:16.698
like actually sleep with me.

27:16.698 --> 27:18.700
Yeah.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.702
I'd like that.

27:20.702 --> 27:22.704
(Mouths word)

27:28.643 --> 27:31.646
Okay. You don't need
the tie.

27:31.646 --> 27:34.649
(Sighs)

27:36.618 --> 27:39.654
This is nice.
It's like junior high.

27:39.654 --> 27:41.656
Yeah, if we'd grown up
in Bombay.

27:41.656 --> 27:44.592
Mm. (Laughs)

27:44.592 --> 27:47.595
(TV playing indistinctly)

28:04.646 --> 28:06.714
(Knock on door)

28:12.654 --> 28:14.622
Hey.

28:14.622 --> 28:15.690
Hi.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.693
Thanks for meeting me
halfway.

28:18.693 --> 28:21.629
No problem.

28:23.665 --> 28:26.668
Nice place.

28:26.668 --> 28:29.704
Not exactly my idea
of a love nest.

28:29.704 --> 28:34.609
Well, you know,
man plans, God laughs.

28:34.609 --> 28:37.679
It's a long story.

28:39.647 --> 28:41.649
You look good.

28:43.618 --> 28:45.620
So do you.

28:50.592 --> 28:52.627
(Sighs)

28:54.662 --> 28:56.698
You gonna
keep the collar on?

28:56.698 --> 28:58.666
You want me to?

28:58.666 --> 29:00.635
No. I don't know.

29:00.635 --> 29:03.605
I've never done this before.

29:03.605 --> 29:05.607
Well, neither have I.

29:05.607 --> 29:07.609
I mean, technically.

29:07.609 --> 29:10.645
I've only cheated on you...

29:10.645 --> 29:12.647
Not with you.

29:15.617 --> 29:18.653
You're such a bastard.

29:18.653 --> 29:20.655
(Chuckles)

29:33.601 --> 29:34.702
(Woman) ♪ one more stop ♪

29:34.702 --> 29:37.639
Why isn't Brian coming along?

29:37.639 --> 29:38.706
I don't know.

29:38.706 --> 29:40.708
I am not
my half brother's keeper.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.710
(Laughs)

Hello.

29:47.682 --> 29:50.652
Yes.

29:50.652 --> 29:53.688
Oh, okay. Yeah.

29:53.688 --> 29:56.691
Thank you.
All right. Bye.
Who was that?

29:56.691 --> 29:58.693
Um, my doctor in New York.

29:58.693 --> 30:00.695
He was the one who did
the physical.

30:00.695 --> 30:02.697
Just calling to confirm

30:02.697 --> 30:05.633
that all of my lady parts
are good to go.

30:05.633 --> 30:07.602
Ah.

30:09.704 --> 30:11.639
(Charles) Senator.

30:11.639 --> 30:12.707
Another potcheen, please,

30:12.707 --> 30:14.709
and one for
my esteemed colleague

30:14.709 --> 30:16.678
from across the aisle.

30:16.678 --> 30:18.680
To what do I owe
the pleasure, senator?

30:18.680 --> 30:20.715
Your father running low
on whipping boys?

30:20.715 --> 30:22.717
The opposite.

30:22.717 --> 30:24.719
I've come to apologize

30:24.719 --> 30:27.689
for my complete ignorance
earlier.

30:27.689 --> 30:29.691
I think I understand now

30:29.691 --> 30:31.693
why you were
so frustrated with me.

30:31.693 --> 30:35.597
You do?

30:35.597 --> 30:37.632
Really?

30:37.632 --> 30:38.700
Of course.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.635
I've been subjected to

30:40.635 --> 30:43.638
a lifetime of bullying
from my father.

30:43.638 --> 30:46.708
It stands to reason
I haven't been the only one.

30:46.708 --> 30:49.711
Listen, I know my father

30:49.711 --> 30:52.614
will never give you
the apology you deserve,

30:52.614 --> 30:55.617
but, uh, I hope
you will accept mine.

30:55.617 --> 30:57.685
Whatever he did
to pressure you...

30:57.685 --> 30:59.654
I'm sorry.

30:59.654 --> 31:02.690
(Instrumental piano music
playing)

31:07.695 --> 31:10.598
Apology accepted.

31:10.598 --> 31:12.634
Great.

31:12.634 --> 31:13.701
Terrific.

31:13.701 --> 31:16.638
(Laughs)

31:16.638 --> 31:20.642
Well, I hope this means
we can... move forward.

31:20.642 --> 31:23.645
Oh, I hope so, too.

31:32.654 --> 31:34.589
Excuse me?

31:34.589 --> 31:35.623
What?

31:35.623 --> 31:37.692
(Scoffs)
What the hell was that?

31:40.628 --> 31:43.631
I thought you understood
what your father had on me.

31:48.670 --> 31:51.706
You... have a wife
and children.

31:51.706 --> 31:54.609
And you have a thing
for transsexuals.

31:54.609 --> 31:58.680
Yeah, with... female parts.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.616
I'm, uh...

32:01.616 --> 32:02.684
I'm not gay.

32:06.621 --> 32:09.657
Oh, um...

32:09.657 --> 32:11.659
I'm sorry...

32:11.659 --> 32:14.596
For the confusion,
senator.

32:14.596 --> 32:16.598
And I'm sorry...

32:16.598 --> 32:17.665
(Gulps) Ahh...

32:17.665 --> 32:20.668
But you won't
be getting my vote.

32:25.673 --> 32:29.611
That went well.

32:30.712 --> 32:33.648
Don't wander off.

32:35.617 --> 32:37.719
(Car door closes)

32:42.690 --> 32:44.692
Dad!

32:44.692 --> 32:48.663
(Grunts) How are you?
Are you having fun?

32:48.663 --> 32:51.699
Yeah. Now that you're here,
though, it's even better.

32:51.699 --> 32:53.701
Well, thank you.

32:53.701 --> 32:56.604
(Grunts)
Oh. Your mom's here.

32:56.604 --> 32:58.606
Why are you doing this?

32:58.606 --> 33:01.609
Well, like I said,
this is my weekend with Kiki,

33:01.609 --> 33:04.612
so I thought I'd come
and pick her up.
You drove all the way here
for me?

33:04.612 --> 33:06.648
Of course I did.

33:06.648 --> 33:09.651
You can't just show up here
unannounced, Nick.

33:09.651 --> 33:11.719
We--we talked about this.
No, we didn't talk
about anything.

33:11.719 --> 33:13.721
That's why
I had to drive down here.

33:13.721 --> 33:15.723
Ten minutes to dinnertime,
baby doll.

33:15.723 --> 33:18.626
Oh. Hi.

33:19.694 --> 33:21.696
Baby doll?

33:21.696 --> 33:23.665
Edward, this is Nick.

33:23.665 --> 33:27.669
Nick.
I've heard a lot about you.

33:27.669 --> 33:30.605
Hi.

33:32.707 --> 33:34.642
Hey, hey, Kiki,

33:34.642 --> 33:37.645
would you mind staying here
for a second with Edward?

33:37.645 --> 33:39.714
I just want to talk
to your mom.

33:39.714 --> 33:41.716
(Lisa)
Okay. Be right back.

33:41.716 --> 33:43.718
What the hell
is going on here?

33:43.718 --> 33:45.653
He's my client.

33:45.653 --> 33:47.655
Well, unless you're
a prostitute,

33:47.655 --> 33:49.657
he's obviously much more
than just a client.
Funny.

33:49.657 --> 33:52.594
Edward invited me here
to update his art collection.

33:52.594 --> 33:54.662
We're getting along.
Oh, well, obviously.
Baby doll?

33:54.662 --> 33:56.698
You and I have been separated
for two months, Nick.

33:56.698 --> 33:59.701
I am allowed to date.
Lisa, you didn't inform me
you were taking our daughter,

33:59.701 --> 34:02.637
and you took her
across state lines.
Oh, don't talk to me
like we're in court.

34:02.637 --> 34:05.673
I'm not on the stand, Nick,
and you are not the judge.

34:05.673 --> 34:08.710
What, you want to tell me
that you've been so pure?
I never said I was pure.

34:08.710 --> 34:11.713
(Chuckles) Talk about getting
in bed with your clients.

34:11.713 --> 34:14.649
Hey, whatever I am,
I'm still Kiki's father.

34:14.649 --> 34:16.650
And for our daughter's sake...

34:16.650 --> 34:18.652
I'm not gonna cause a scene.

34:18.652 --> 34:20.588
I'm gonna get outta here.

34:20.588 --> 34:22.657
But you know and I know
that after this little stunt

34:22.657 --> 34:24.626
you'll never get
full custody now.

34:24.626 --> 34:26.628
50-50 is the best
you can hope for,

34:26.628 --> 34:28.630
which is what I've been
offering all along.

34:28.630 --> 34:31.632
Now you make sure
that Kiki's back by Monday.

34:33.668 --> 34:35.703
Hey, Kiki.

34:37.672 --> 34:40.708
Man, I had no idea you were
having such a good time,

34:40.708 --> 34:42.710
and I gotta get back
to the city.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.646
So is it okay

34:44.646 --> 34:47.649
if we see each other
when you get back into town?
Okay.

34:47.649 --> 34:49.650
All right, hug. (Groans)

34:49.650 --> 34:51.652
Bye.

34:52.687 --> 34:53.721
Dad.

34:53.721 --> 34:55.657
Yeah.

34:55.657 --> 34:56.690
I love you.

34:58.693 --> 35:00.695
I love you, too.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.603
You ready for dinner?

35:08.603 --> 35:10.605
Come on.

35:20.682 --> 35:22.650
Simon.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.719
What did you say
to Jeremy?

35:24.719 --> 35:27.722
About what?
Me.

35:27.722 --> 35:32.594
Triton, go start the car.

35:32.594 --> 35:33.695
Tell me what happened.

35:33.695 --> 35:35.697
He came screaming at me

35:35.697 --> 35:38.633
saying that
you told him everything

35:38.633 --> 35:40.635
about how I was plotting
against the family,

35:40.635 --> 35:42.637
trying to tear them apart.

35:42.637 --> 35:45.640
I told him he didn't understand,
and then he hit me.

35:45.640 --> 35:49.644
(Scoffs) I assure you, I didn't
tell him to do that. Not at all.

35:49.644 --> 35:51.679
Simon. Simon--
look, I am under
a lot of pressure right now.

35:51.679 --> 35:54.616
Pressure
you know nothing about.

35:54.616 --> 35:56.651
If you want to make it easy
for yourself,

35:56.651 --> 35:58.686
stay away from Jeremy Darling.

35:58.686 --> 36:02.657
(Screaming)

36:02.657 --> 36:06.628
(Car alarm blaring)

36:06.628 --> 36:07.695
(Woman screams)

36:07.695 --> 36:11.699
(Alarm continues)

36:11.699 --> 36:13.701
That was meant for you.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.615
Looks like
smooth sailing tonight, folks.

36:27.615 --> 36:30.652
So, uh, we should be home
in no time.

36:30.652 --> 36:32.620
(Nick) You've been quiet.

36:33.688 --> 36:36.691
Mei ling
lightened your mood?

36:36.691 --> 36:39.694
She... changed it.

36:39.694 --> 36:43.665
Was it everything
you expected it to be?

36:43.665 --> 36:47.635
You want to hear
all the dirty details?

36:47.635 --> 36:49.704
(Lowered voice)
She came to the motel.

36:49.704 --> 36:51.673
I invited her in.

36:51.673 --> 36:54.676
She took off her coat.

36:54.676 --> 36:58.613
We sat on the bed
for 20 minutes,

36:58.613 --> 37:02.684
17 of which...
I talked about Andrea.

37:02.684 --> 37:04.719
And that was it.

37:08.623 --> 37:12.594
So you didn't
go through with it?

37:13.695 --> 37:17.632
No, I didn't.
I couldn't.

37:17.632 --> 37:18.700
Huh.

37:18.700 --> 37:22.704
Those last three minutes...
I tried.

37:22.704 --> 37:24.639
(Laughs)

37:24.639 --> 37:26.708
The monster
wouldn't come to life.

37:26.708 --> 37:28.643
Hmm.

37:28.643 --> 37:31.646
Well, maybe it's
for the best, Brian.

37:31.646 --> 37:33.648
You're actually
one step closer

37:33.648 --> 37:35.717
to committing to something,

37:35.717 --> 37:37.652
to someone
you really love.

37:37.652 --> 37:39.654
Yeah? What about you?

37:39.654 --> 37:41.689
Wh-wh-what do you mean,
me and...

37:41.689 --> 37:43.691
Me and Karen?

37:43.691 --> 37:45.627
Yeah.

37:45.627 --> 37:47.629
(Mutters)

37:47.629 --> 37:50.698
The two of you having
a kid would be weird, sure,

37:50.698 --> 37:52.667
but it wouldn't be

37:52.667 --> 37:55.703
the worst thing
that ever happened.

38:05.613 --> 38:08.650
Oh, it's so good to be home.

38:08.650 --> 38:13.621
That was exhausting.

38:13.621 --> 38:15.623
Oh, hey.

38:15.623 --> 38:18.693
Thanks for the lift. I owe you
4 bucks for the tolls.

38:18.693 --> 38:20.628
See ya.

38:20.628 --> 38:22.597
See ya.

38:22.597 --> 38:24.632
Hey, Karen.
Here.

38:24.632 --> 38:28.636
I know what it's like to want
to have a child. I do.

38:28.636 --> 38:30.705
And I don't know
if I ever told you this,

38:30.705 --> 38:33.641
but Lisa and I had to try
for six months

38:33.641 --> 38:35.710
before we got pregnant
with Kiki.

38:35.710 --> 38:37.679
And I remember
what it was like...

38:37.679 --> 38:40.648
Laying in bed thinking about
this little person

38:40.648 --> 38:42.717
I wanted so badly to meet.

38:42.717 --> 38:45.620
She just wouldn't show up,

38:45.620 --> 38:48.590
and it drove me crazy.

38:48.590 --> 38:49.657
Oh...

38:51.626 --> 38:52.694
You know how I feel.

38:52.694 --> 38:55.663
That's a--that's
a real consolation, Nick.

38:55.663 --> 38:57.599
Thanks.

38:57.599 --> 38:59.601
Hey, no. Karen, Karen,
I guess what I'm--

38:59.601 --> 39:02.670
what I'm trying
to tell you is...

39:02.670 --> 39:04.606
I love you.

39:06.608 --> 39:08.676
I do.

39:08.676 --> 39:12.614
And I am open
to being your baby daddy.

39:12.614 --> 39:14.616
(Chuckles)

39:14.616 --> 39:16.684
What--you're--you're open--
you're open to--

39:16.684 --> 39:18.720
you're open to it?
Yeah.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.656
I can't do it yet,
and I'm--and I'm sorry.

39:21.656 --> 39:23.691
But I-I can't.
I can't do it yet.

39:23.691 --> 39:26.594
Ok-okay.

39:26.594 --> 39:28.630
But if we were
to take things slow,

39:28.630 --> 39:30.665
like... with us--

39:30.665 --> 39:32.667
like--like going out?
Yeah.

39:32.667 --> 39:34.702
Yeah.
Yeah, going out.

39:34.702 --> 39:40.642
Maybe it wouldn't be
such a long way away.

39:40.642 --> 39:43.711
We might get there sooner
than either one of us thinks.

39:47.649 --> 39:49.584
What's wrong?

39:49.584 --> 39:50.585
Nothing.

39:50.585 --> 39:52.587
Karen, I--

39:52.587 --> 39:53.655
that was just--
that was...

39:53.655 --> 39:55.690
(Chuckles)
That was really...

39:55.690 --> 39:57.692
(Voice breaks)
That was really sweet,

39:57.692 --> 40:00.662
what you just said.

40:07.669 --> 40:09.671
Get some sleep.

40:16.611 --> 40:17.645
(Letitia) Dear?

40:17.645 --> 40:20.648
I thought that was you.

40:22.684 --> 40:25.687
Oh... what's wrong?

40:25.687 --> 40:29.624
I'm pregnant.

40:29.624 --> 40:30.658
Already?

40:30.658 --> 40:32.660
My, those sperm banks
are very efficient.

40:32.660 --> 40:35.663
No, no, no, no. No, no,
mom, mom, it isn't...

40:35.663 --> 40:38.633
It doesn't have anything
to do with sperm banks.

40:38.633 --> 40:40.702
It's--the doctor
that gave me the physical,

40:40.702 --> 40:43.605
he called this morning.
I'm pregnant.

40:43.605 --> 40:44.672
With Simon's baby?

40:44.672 --> 40:46.608
With Simon's baby.

40:46.608 --> 40:48.610
Oh, no.

40:48.610 --> 40:49.677
I know.

40:49.677 --> 40:51.613
Oh. Oh.

40:51.613 --> 40:54.649
Oh, my God.

40:54.649 --> 40:57.619
Mm.

40:57.619 --> 40:59.621
Oh, baby.

41:02.724 --> 41:07.339
Jeremy, I'm sorry I had to
call you over so late.

41:09.275 --> 41:12.278
Thanks for coming.

41:12.278 --> 41:14.346
Thanks for having me...

41:14.346 --> 41:16.348
I think.

41:18.317 --> 41:21.287
I'm sure you heard
about the maybach...

41:23.289 --> 41:25.324
And triton.

41:25.324 --> 41:28.360
Well, I've--
I've got a vague memory.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.296
Vague? (Laughs)

41:30.296 --> 41:33.299
You got a lot more
than a vague memory.

41:33.299 --> 41:35.367
Let's cut to the chase,
Jeremy.

41:35.367 --> 41:38.270
I know
you don't have amnesia.

41:38.270 --> 41:40.339
(Scoffs) If--if I
remember correctly, I do.

41:40.339 --> 41:43.342
Do not waste my time.
See, I got this gut instinct

41:43.342 --> 41:45.344
that says
you're not the kind of guy

41:45.344 --> 41:47.346
who's gonna punch
a woman in the face.

41:47.346 --> 41:50.282
That sounds a lot more
like Nola’s idea.
(Mutters)

41:50.282 --> 41:51.350
It's okay.
Jeremy, it's okay.

41:51.350 --> 41:54.320
Because, see,
you failed at fooling me

41:54.320 --> 41:56.322
about the status
of your memory,

41:56.322 --> 41:58.324
but you succeeded
in communicating to me

41:58.324 --> 42:01.327
how much you care for her
and her little brother.

42:01.327 --> 42:04.263
Brother? Uh, I didn't know
she had a brother.

42:04.263 --> 42:07.266
Yeah, yeah, you did. Now this
is what we're gonna do.

42:07.266 --> 42:09.301
See, I'm gonna let you be
the big hero.

42:09.301 --> 42:14.273
I'll arrange things so you can
rescue Nola’s brother.

42:14.273 --> 42:17.276
But I'll need something
from you.

42:17.276 --> 42:19.311
What?

42:19.311 --> 42:22.281
I'm gonna need you
to kill someone.

42:26.285 --> 42:27.319
Who?

42:35.327 --> 42:36.257
Me.
