WEBVTT

00:05.473 --> 00:09.043
HI. I'M ARIANNA.
I LIVE NEXT DOOR.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.245
OH, HI. I'M CLAUDIA.
COME ON IN.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.114
IT'S SO NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.382
YOU KNOW, WE'VE TALKED
ON THE PHONE

00:14.415 --> 00:17.285
JUST 'CAUSE OF THAT
LITTLE THING WITH JIMMY
AND YOUR DAUGHTER.

00:17.318 --> 00:20.288
HE STALKED HER
RELENTLESSLY FOR A MONTH.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.124
YEAH. HE'S AT THAT AGE.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.125
RIGHT.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.793
I CAME OVER BECAUSE
I GOT A PIECE OF YOUR MAIL.

00:25.826 --> 00:29.697
IT SAYS FINAL NOTICE,
SO I FIGURED IT WAS IMPORTANT.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.799
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.202
THIS IS A REALLY BAD
FIRST IMPRESSION.

00:34.235 --> 00:37.105
SECOND IMPRESSION.
FIRST WAS JIMMY.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.272
RIGHT.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.174
ANYWAY, I'D BETTER GO.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.376
WHY DON'T YOU STAY?
COME ON IN. HAVE A SEAT.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.611
WE'LL, UH...

00:43.644 --> 00:45.446
LOOKS LIKE
THE COUCH IS TAKEN.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.382
YEAH. OUR DRYER
JUST BROKE,

00:48.416 --> 00:50.118
AND WE DON'T HAVE
A CLOTHESLINE.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.453
BUT WE COULD AFFORD
A CLOTHESLINE.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.822
WE JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE SILLY
TO SPEND THE 5 BUCKS,

00:54.855 --> 00:57.458
YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE
GONNA GET A NEW DRYER.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.128
THIS IS A REALLY BAD
THIRD IMPRESSION.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.530
THAT'S OK. REALLY.
I SHOULD GO.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.165
Sean: DAMN IT!

01:04.198 --> 01:06.100
DAMN IT!

01:06.134 --> 01:09.370
PARKING THIS THING'S
LIKE PARKING
A FREAKING BATTLESHIP.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.806
THAT'S MY HUSBAND
SEAN.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.609
HEY, BABY.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.381
SO WHAT'S WITH THE LIMO?

01:20.414 --> 01:21.449
OH, BABY,
IT'S MY FRIEND GARRY'S.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.218
HE'S OUT OF TOWN FOR 2 WEEKS
AND SAID I COULD USE IT.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.386
OH, COME ON.
YOU HAVE THE BAR,

01:25.419 --> 01:27.855
AND WITH THE BABY COMING
YOU HAVE A LOT
TO DO AROUND HERE.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.323
YOU REALLY WANT
TO TAKE THIS ON?

01:29.357 --> 01:30.224
BABY, IT'S JUST
A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

01:30.258 --> 01:32.260
AND WE CAN MAKE
SO MUCH EXTRA MONEY. HMM?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.828
YOU ARE
A VERY SWEET MAN.

01:34.862 --> 01:38.232
WHO HAS VERY SHORT PANTS.

01:38.266 --> 01:43.204
THEY'RE GARRY'S. HE'S
GOT REALLY SHORT LEGS
AND LONG ARMS.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.741
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LILY?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.343
I HAVE NO FUTURE.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.778
WHERE DO YOU GET THIS FROM?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.713
MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.248
SO YOU DON'T THINK
YALE'S A REACH?

01:54.282 --> 01:57.818
I THINK YOU'RE
A REACH FOR YALE.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.155
SHOULD I COME BACK?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.390
NO. WE'RE JUST
FINISHING UP.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.525
ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
TIME FOR ME BEFORE LUNCH?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.194
THERE'S ONLY 15 MINUTES.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.261
MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.663
BUT YOU'VE BEEN WITH BRAD

02:09.697 --> 02:11.932
FOR, LIKE,
AN HOUR AND A HALF.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.567
PLENTY OF TIME.

02:13.601 --> 02:14.835
ARE YOU SURE?

02:14.868 --> 02:17.571
I WANT TO EXPLORE
ALL MY OPTIONS.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.773
WE'LL MAKE IT.

02:19.807 --> 02:20.641
OK, MR. KERSEY.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.843
I'LL HAVE THESE FILLED OUT
BY NEXT WEEK.

02:22.876 --> 02:23.977
REMEMBER, YALE'S
A FINE SCHOOL,

02:24.011 --> 02:26.647
BUT THERE'S THE REST
OF THE IVY LEAGUE
TO THINK ABOUT.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.882
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT,
BRADLEY.

02:28.916 --> 02:32.152
THANKS, MR. KERSEY.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.326
SO, LILY, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT
FOR NEXT YEAR?

02:38.359 --> 02:39.360
I DON'T KNOW.

02:39.393 --> 02:42.596
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
I COULD GO TO YALE
WITH BRAD.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.299
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

02:45.333 --> 02:46.967
SERIOUSLY?

02:47.000 --> 02:47.935
WHY NOT?

02:47.968 --> 02:51.805
WELL, LILY, YOUR GRADES
ARE NOT YALE MATERIAL.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.941
WELL, THEN, I WON'T GO
FOR ACADEMICS.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.243
I'LL GO FOR DANCE.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.279
OH, GOD. GOOD PLAN.
THAT SHOULD WORK.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.514
BUT LET ME SUGGEST
AN ALTERNATE.

03:00.548 --> 03:04.252
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
THE FOOD SERVICE
INDUSTRY?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.856
HE THINKS YOU
SHOULD BE A WAITRESS?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.591
OR A HAIRDRESSER
OR A MASSEUSE.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.961
AND I ALREADY CHECKED.
YALE DOESN'T OFFER
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.829
COME ON, LIL.
YOU HAD TO KNOW

03:15.863 --> 03:17.531
YALE WAS A LITTLE
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.533
OH, YEAH. BECAUSE
IT'S THE IVY LEAGUE.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.735
I SHOULD BE LOOKING
IN THE STUPID LEAGUE.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.904
WELL, I'M GONNA GO
TAKE A SHOWER.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.673
ALL THESE TOWELS ARE WET.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.241
I'LL GO TRY
TO FIND YOU A DRY ONE.

03:27.275 --> 03:31.245
OK, BABE. OH, WAIT.
THIS PILLOWCASE IS GOOD.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.780
HEY, MR. FINNERTY.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.648
HEY, LILY.
I'M REALLY SORRY

03:34.682 --> 03:36.450
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH MR. KERSEY.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.519
HMM. LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, BRAD.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.455
DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD APPLY TO YALE?

03:41.489 --> 03:43.991
UM...

03:44.024 --> 03:45.559
SURE.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.294
TOTALLY.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.296
I KNEW IT.
YOU THINK I'M STUPID!

03:48.329 --> 03:50.298
NO, NO, NO, LILY.
YOU'RE NOT.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.767
YOU'RE JUST...YOU'RE
NOT SCHOOL SMART.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.370
THEN I MUST BE
SCHOOL STUPID.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.939
YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.708
GET OUT!

04:01.642 --> 04:02.610
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.644
WELL, HOW COULD I
UNDERSTAND?

04:03.677 --> 04:06.380
I'M TOO IGNORANT
FOR BOOK LEARNIN'.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.348
LILY, I NEVER SAID THAT.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.417
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCHOOL'S JUST WASTED
ON ME.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.619
IN FACT, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST KNOCK ME UP NOW

04:11.652 --> 04:13.053
WHILE WE'RE STILL
IN HIGH SCHOOL

04:13.086 --> 04:14.788
LIKE MY DAD DID
TO MY MOM.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.757
LILY, I--

04:36.944 --> 04:37.878
HEY, BABE.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.513
OH, THANKS FOR GETTING RID
OF THE BROKEN DRYER.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.649
OH, GOD. ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T, BABE.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.384
I MEANT TO DO IT
THIS MORNING,

04:43.417 --> 04:44.284
BUT IT'S ON
THE FRONT PORCH.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.920
I WAS OUT DRIVING
TILL 4 A.M. LAST NIGHT.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.456
OH, YOU POOR THING.

04:48.489 --> 04:52.393
BUT I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU DOING THIS FOR US.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.427
OH, NO PROBLEM, BABE.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.395
IT'S JUST, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
THESE RICH JERKS

04:54.428 --> 04:57.097
YELLING AT YOU,
SITTING IN TRAFFIC
ALL NIGHT.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.966
GARRY'S HEAD'S
SMALLER THAN MINE,

04:58.999 --> 05:01.935
SO AFTER 6 HOURS, THE HAT
REALLY STARTS TO HURT.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.838
WANT ME TO RUB IT
FOR YOU?

05:04.872 --> 05:05.739
OH, YEAH.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.875
MY NECK'S HURTING
A LITTLE BIT, TOO, BABY.

05:07.908 --> 05:08.976
RIGHT--OOH, YEAH.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.579
HEY, YOUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR
ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU THIS.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.648
OH, SHE MADE US
A CASSEROLE.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.683
SO?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.050
SO IT'S A CHARITY CASSEROLE.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.251
SHE THINKS WE'RE LOW CLASS.

05:18.285 --> 05:21.689
PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU GOT A BROKEN DRYER
ON YOUR FRONT PORCH.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.923
AAH! AAH!

05:22.956 --> 05:24.858
I'M SORRY, BABE.

05:24.892 --> 05:25.726
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.595
HE'S GOT A SORE NECK
FROM DRIVING A LIMO.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.364
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO GET
THE HEATING PAD FOR YOU.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.800
AW, THANKS, BABY.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.968
THE LIMO JOB SUCKS, HUH?

05:35.002 --> 05:38.038
IT'S THE BEST
FREAKING JOB OF MY LIFE.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.677
WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO PICK YOU UP?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.946
LET'S SAY 4 HOURS.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.548
YES, SIR.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.652
YEOW!

05:52.986 --> 05:56.123
SATELLITE TV IN A CAR?

05:56.156 --> 05:58.626
AM I DREAMING?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.962
CASHEWS.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.897
NOTHING BUT CASHEWS!

06:03.931 --> 06:05.399
HA HA HA HA HA!

06:05.433 --> 06:08.736
I'D LIKE TO ORDER A PIZZA
FOR DELIVERY, PLEASE.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.439
LICENSE PLATE NUMBER--

06:15.008 --> 06:16.510
AND THE BEST PART
OF IT IS

06:16.544 --> 06:18.045
THAT CLAUDIA THINKS
I'M A HERO

06:18.078 --> 06:19.547
FOR TAKING A SECOND JOB.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.848
THAT SOUNDS
EXACTLY LIKE MY LIFE,

06:20.881 --> 06:23.817
EXCEPT YESTERDAY
I GOT A SHOCK FROM
MY ELECTRIC CAR

06:23.851 --> 06:26.554
AND I STILL GET NUMB
IN MY LEFT LEG.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.562
"BECKY, DO YOU WANT
TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH ME?"

06:34.595 --> 06:39.933
"BECKY, DO YOU WANT
TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH ME?"

06:41.001 --> 06:41.902
WHAT'S UP?

06:41.935 --> 06:45.739
I'M IN THIS STUPID PLAY,
TOM SAWYER,

06:45.773 --> 06:47.975
AND I REALLY CAN'T DO THIS.

06:48.008 --> 06:48.942
LET ME HELP.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.712
NO OFFENSE, BUT WHAT
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ACTING?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.715
I'VE HAD MY SHARE
OF TITLE ROLES.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.917
LIFE IN ANATEFKA
IS PRECARIOUS.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.952
IT'S LIKE A FIDDLER
ON THE ROOF.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.121
HOW YA DOIN'?

07:01.689 --> 07:04.692
OK, BUT DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.560
I'LL BE BECKY.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.530
BECKY, DO YOU WANT
TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH ME?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.764
NO.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.000
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY OK,
BUT WE HAVE TO WATCH
FOR INJUN JOE.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.703
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS
ABOUT INJUN JOE.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.939
IN FACT, I'D RATHER TAKE
MY CHANCES WITH HIM

07:18.972 --> 07:21.509
THAN TO WALK WITH A WIMP
LIKE YOU.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.477
I'M JUST DOING MY LINE.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.479
HEY, YOU WANNA
WALK ME TO SCHOOL?

07:25.513 --> 07:29.049
I'M CUTE. I GOT PIGTAILS
AND A GINGHAM SKIRT.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.083
MAKE ME FEEL IT.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.919
OK. UM...

07:31.952 --> 07:34.988
BECKY, DO YOU WANT
TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH ME?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.090
WHY NOT?
NO.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.059
COME ON.
I'M NOT FEELING IT.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.861
SHOW ME SOME PASSION.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.095
MAKE ME FEEL IT.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.933
OK. BECKY, DO YOU WANT
TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH ME?

07:45.966 --> 07:46.967
WHY NOT?
NO!

07:47.000 --> 07:50.538
I'M A LITTLE GIRL.
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.908
HEY, YOU GUYS.
IS LILY AROUND?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.109
NOT YET.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.678
OH, NOT MUCH.
I JUST...

07:57.711 --> 07:59.947
GOT AN INTERVIEW
WITH YALE! WHOO!

07:59.980 --> 08:02.616
CONGRATULATIONS, BRAD.
THAT'S HUGE.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.084
I KNOW. NOW I JUST
GOT TO FIGURE OUT

08:04.117 --> 08:06.554
THE RIGHT WAY
TO TELL LILY.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.556
I GOT AN INTERVIEW
WITH YALE!

08:08.589 --> 08:09.957
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I...

08:09.990 --> 08:12.726
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S OK,
BECAUSE I DID, TOO!

08:12.760 --> 08:13.961
UH-HUH!

08:13.994 --> 08:15.696
WOW! THAT--

08:15.729 --> 08:16.964
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.766
I...WOW!

08:18.799 --> 08:21.635
I GUESS I'M NOT
AS STUPID AS YOU
THOUGHT I WAS, HUH?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.003
NO, I GUESS NOT.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.706
I MEAN, I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WERE STUPID.

08:25.739 --> 08:29.610
I...I THOUGHT
YOU WERE PRETTY.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.714
I'LL JUST
LET MYSELF OUT.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.082
LILY...

08:35.115 --> 08:39.086
OK, WHAT IS GOING ON?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.187
WHAT? IS IT THAT HARD
TO BELIEVE

08:40.220 --> 08:41.989
THAT I GOT
AN INTERVIEW WITH YALE?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.323
LILY?

08:43.356 --> 08:46.627
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN
SOMETHING

08:46.660 --> 08:47.595
IN MY APPLICATION.

08:47.628 --> 08:51.298
Lily's voice:
"NAME: LILY CATHERINE FINNERTY.

08:51.331 --> 08:55.068
"BIRTH DATE: JULY 13th.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.337
"SEX: FEMALE.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.106
RACE..."

08:59.139 --> 09:01.008
Brad's voice: YOU'RE
JUST NOT SCHOOL SMART.

09:01.041 --> 09:05.846
Sean's voice: LILY,
YALE'S A LITTLE BIT
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.582
Mr. Kersey's voice:
FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.284
Lily's voice:
"NATIVE AMERICAN."

09:11.318 --> 09:14.655
YOU TOLD THEM
YOU'RE NATIVE AMERICAN?

09:14.688 --> 09:15.455
IT'S TRUE!

09:15.488 --> 09:17.090

18:41.087 --> 18:45.192
I HAVE A HUGE JOB,
TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS
AND THE HOUSE AND YOU.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.194
IF ANYONE NEEDS TO
SACK OUT IN THAT LIMO,

18:47.227 --> 18:47.960
IT'S ME.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.329
I WOULDN'T GO
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW

18:49.362 --> 18:50.930
'CAUSE WITHOUT YOU
TO PICK UP AFTER ME,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.432
I MEAN, THAT PLACE
ISN'T TOO PLEASANT.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.701
ARE WE EVER GONNA HAVE
DOWNTIME AGAIN?

18:54.734 --> 18:57.337
OF COURSE, BABY.
LOOK, LILY'S GOING
OFF TO COLLEGE.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.771
JIMMY,
HE'S A TEENAGER.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.374
WE HAVE
THE BABY COMING.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.511
WELL, IN
A LITTLE OVER 18 YEARS,

19:04.544 --> 19:07.414
WE'LL HAVE
SOME SERIOUS DOWNTIME.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.719
HEY.
HOW WAS THE PLAY?

19:12.752 --> 19:14.654
I TOTALLY CONNECTED.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.390
ACTION.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.431
AND...GO.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.704
TOM SAWYER?

19:31.738 --> 19:34.574

19:35.475 --> 19:38.211
ARE YOU TALKIN' TO ME?

19:38.445 --> 19:40.713
UM...YES, TOM.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.850
ISN'T THIS
THE MOST PERFECT DAY
FOR A PICNIC?

19:43.883 --> 19:49.422
YOU THINK THIS IS
THE MOST PERFECT DAY
FOR A PICNIC?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.358
YES?

19:51.391 --> 19:52.259
YOU TELLIN' ME,

19:52.292 --> 19:54.361
THIS IS THE MOST
PERFECT DAY FOR A PICNIC?

19:54.394 --> 19:57.864
UH, JIMMY,
ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE
WITH YOUR LINES?

19:57.897 --> 20:02.435
ARE YOU ASKIN' ME
IF I'M HAVING TROUBLE
WITH MY LINES?

20:02.469 --> 20:04.671
OK, WE'RE
GONNA TAKE A 5,

20:04.704 --> 20:05.672
AMD WHEN
WE COME BACK,

20:05.705 --> 20:06.706
WE'RE GONNA
MIX IT UP.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.707
FRANK,
YOU TRY TOM..

20:07.740 --> 20:11.444
JIMMY, MMM,
YOU DO LIGHTS.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.481
SO, HE STUCK YOU
ON LIGHTS.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.283
YEAH.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

20:16.316 --> 20:18.451
WHEN WE STARTED,
I WAS BECKY THATCHER.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.487
NOW HE'S GOT ME
WEARING THIS.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.389
ARE YOU
THE STAGE MANAGER?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.423
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME,

20:23.456 --> 20:25.692
BUT I DON'T THINK
THIS IS CONNECTED
TO ANYTHING.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.828
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER...

20:30.497 --> 20:31.564
NOTHING.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.700
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

20:33.733 --> 20:36.536
THAT I WAS REALLY
BLOWN AWAY BY WHAT
YOU DID UP THERE.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.406
I MEAN,
YOU WERE SO REAL,

20:39.439 --> 20:41.308
SO RAW.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.743
I JUST WANTED TO...

20:47.046 --> 20:48.548
SEE THAT, MAN,
I TOLD YOU.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.516
YOU TOUCHED SOMEBODY.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.952
YEP, AND I'M
GONNA TOUCH HER
AGAIN ON FRIDAY.
