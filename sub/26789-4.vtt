WEBVTT

00:07.298 --> 00:11.761
[man] Brothers and sisters,
behold, I tell you a mystery.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.806
We shall not all fall asleep,

00:15.223 --> 00:18.935
but we will all be changed in an instant,

00:19.019 --> 00:22.188
in the blink of an eye,
at the last trumpet.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.066
For the trumpet will sound

00:25.525 --> 00:28.862
and the dead will be raised incorruptible,

00:29.446 --> 00:31.281
and we shall be changed.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.951
Almighty God,

00:35.660 --> 00:39.372
remember the mercy with which you graced
your humble servant.

00:40.331 --> 00:44.836
Receive her, we pray,
into the mansions of the saints.

00:44.919 --> 00:48.590
As we prepare our sister's final resting,

00:48.673 --> 00:51.926
look also with love on those who mourn

00:52.218 --> 00:54.679
and give them comfort in their loss.

00:55.847 --> 01:00.143
Grant this through Christ, our Lord, Amen.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.811
[all] Amen.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.172
[chattering]

01:49.192 --> 01:52.946
- Madam President, can I ride with you?
- Of course.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.706
[engine turns over]

03:46.100 --> 03:47.477
Has he approached you?

03:49.145 --> 03:50.145
Who?

03:51.189 --> 03:52.189
Petrov.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.819
[sighs] Didn't he just arrive?

03:58.488 --> 04:01.032
If the talks on Syria have broken down,
what's he doing here?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.993
It's either a good thing or a bad thing.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.704
Well, which is it?

04:08.873 --> 04:10.124
Madam President?

04:11.626 --> 04:13.378
He was fond of Cathy.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.388
I need to know that you won't stand
in the way of my handling...

04:23.471 --> 04:25.974
Mark. It's done.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.267
You won.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.859
It was necessary to show you,

04:37.443 --> 04:38.569
but not what I wanted.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.613
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.450
You did that to both of us. You did it.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.329
You involved me, you implicated me.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.209
- You left him in my house.
- Mark, that's enough.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.504
It doesn't matter anymore.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.510
[chattering]

05:08.349 --> 05:10.685
Stan, my deepest condolences.

05:11.144 --> 05:15.732
This is Cathy's brother Hunter.
He flew in from Eugene.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.276
Just outside Lane County.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.069
[Claire] Beautiful country out there.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.740
I was planning to come out anyway.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.451
Stan's birthday is on the sixth.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.827
Cathy and I have been...

05:28.411 --> 05:29.912
back and forth for months.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.873
I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.836
- Doug, this is Cathy's brother Hunter.
- Hi.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.397
- Hey.
- [Claire] And you've met Stan.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.423
- Of course.
- Thank you for coming.

05:40.882 --> 05:44.927
Doug, I think, spent more time
with Cathy than anyone.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.180
She didn't deserve this.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.141
Honestly, it doesn't seem real.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.480
Would you excuse me?

05:58.232 --> 05:59.650
What time did she die?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.528
I don't...

06:02.612 --> 06:04.947
Sorry, I know it's a weird question.
I just...

06:05.031 --> 06:06.908
I had one of those feelings that day.

06:08.284 --> 06:12.038
Um... 5:43, I think.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.957
Yeah, right around then.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.586
Mr. President.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.254
President Underwood.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.509
Secretary Durant was
from a time that's passed.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.386
Holbrooke, Albright...

06:26.469 --> 06:29.138
They knew how to have a good meal
and some friendly conversation

06:29.222 --> 06:31.015
before diplomacy got ugly.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.727
It certainly won't be the same
without her.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.439
I hear they have you on a short leash.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.609
How could you let that happen,
Madam President?

06:41.859 --> 06:45.655
Now, when we're only moments away
from crisis.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.575
You know, in some cultures

06:49.659 --> 06:53.037
it occurs to them
to actually honor the dead.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.749
Every seven years the Malagasy people

06:56.833 --> 06:59.335
exhume the bones, wrapping them in cloth,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.546
so they can dance with the bodies.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.175
[sighs] How does this town
rise to the occasion?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.471
It's like their heads are on a swivel.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.268
Yeah. What do you call those things?

07:15.351 --> 07:16.561
Bobble heads?

07:17.937 --> 07:18.938
Terrifying.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.899
No, don't... Let her be.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.196
You wanted her to play the part.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.198
Voilà.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.410
- The president.
- The president is too agreeable.

07:33.828 --> 07:34.996
What did you do to her?

07:35.079 --> 07:38.416
I trust her contempt
more than whatever this is.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.460
Love, I know what you're capable of.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.336
Hey.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.383
DIA believes there are
over 100,000 Russian troops

07:47.467 --> 07:49.760
- on their way to the border.
- Did you find Bugayev?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.555
As of a few minutes ago,
his second in command assured me

07:52.638 --> 07:55.558
that was the last contact
we would have from anyone at the Kremlin.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.935
Except for him.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.538
[Siegerson] He's requesting
a private meeting with the president.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.774
- Sure.
- God damn it.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.777
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Vice President.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.488
You know Secretary Siegerson.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.573
- Yes. Of course.
- So good to see you.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.868
Madam President, excuse me.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.287
Oh, yes. Excuse me a moment.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.413
[man] Of course.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.875
Cathy was kind to me.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.212
A role model. Sensible, shrewd.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.005
Fluent in French.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.090
[speaks French] Rest in peace.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.719
I know it's not the place, but...

08:32.929 --> 08:35.139
this isn't normal, what's going on.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.808
When I accepted my position,
it was to work with you and your agenda,

08:38.893 --> 08:39.894
not...

08:40.477 --> 08:41.477
not...

08:44.315 --> 08:46.651
Certain members of our Cabinet

08:46.734 --> 08:48.736
in positions related to National Security

08:48.819 --> 08:51.614
have had several secret meetings
regarding Syria.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.741
President Petrov has become aware

08:53.824 --> 08:57.036
of their plans for sending
private contractors to the region.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.495
Ma'am...

08:59.247 --> 09:01.082
there are officials in the Pentagon,

09:01.165 --> 09:03.543
people at the Kremlin,
who would very much like to prevent

09:03.626 --> 09:06.462
- a proxy war...
- Nora, I appreciate your candor,

09:07.004 --> 09:08.297
but Mark has this.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.258
Ma'am, the Cabinet is his.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.842
He knows what we need to do.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.975
What makes me suspect
you're vying for speaker is

09:19.183 --> 09:20.893
the frontrunners change day to day,

09:20.977 --> 09:23.062
but everybody's second choice
remains the same.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.147
- You.
- Brett, are you saying you wouldn't do it,

09:25.231 --> 09:26.357
if the party asked?

09:26.440 --> 09:28.401
If the party knew what was good for them.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.862
This is Douglas Stamper.
He's coming on as a consultant.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.322
We've met.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.199
Jonah, back when Francis was whip,

09:35.283 --> 09:38.244
and you,
back when you were getting us coffee.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.246
I do wonder how he'd feel with some

09:40.329 --> 09:44.333
of the legislation the good congressman
is putting his name on.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.669
Constitution was built
on checks and balances.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.962
And the people's will.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.548
It's not about who the president is.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.550
It's about what the office has become.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.388
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me
for a minute,

09:57.471 --> 10:00.391
I promised Brett here I'd introduce him
to a blue dog Democrat,

10:00.725 --> 10:02.184
assuming I can find one.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.825
[Jonah] I never thought I'd see him again.

10:05.896 --> 10:06.897
He was in rehab.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.317
And is back in the program.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.987
[Rob] Those charges were dropped,
but he's still got a case chasing him.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.741
If anything, my bet is
that case is chasing the president.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.701
[Seth]
Petrov is no longer in the main room.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.995
Secretary Siegerson is still
with Ms. Davis,

10:21.495 --> 10:23.289
while the vice president's exiting.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.752
And Homeland Secretary Cafferty
was just whispering with the president.

10:28.544 --> 10:32.548
As for Doug Stamper,
he's with Assistant Director Green.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.471
I want to know who Durant was with,

10:38.763 --> 10:41.849
when and where, leading up to the moment
she was pronounced dead.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.101
If I start asking around...

10:44.477 --> 10:46.687
Questions bring more questions.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.440
- Is this an open investigation?
- No.

10:49.523 --> 10:53.027
But for any agent I work with,
I'll be the red flag.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.531
Doug, the more I know,
the better it is for both of us.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.242
You trust me?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.665
You've always followed through.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.125
Then do as I say.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.801
[Claire] But what did you find?

11:19.011 --> 11:20.011
Is he talking?

11:21.931 --> 11:24.058
All right. Get back to me
when you know anything more.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.476
Day or night.

11:26.852 --> 11:27.852
[beep]

11:28.688 --> 11:30.022
Is everything okay?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.149
That was about Tom Yates.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.443
There's been a recent charge
on his credit card.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.487
The Grand Mark in Prague,

11:36.570 --> 11:38.531
except it wasn't Tom.

11:38.614 --> 11:41.283
He didn't make the charge.
Or any of the others.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.911
- Somebody stole his...
- His identity.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.749
As of now, we have no idea
where the real Tom Yates has been.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.545
Well, I hope he's safe.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.338
Wherever he is.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.465
Me too.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.141
[humming]

12:09.019 --> 12:10.019
[Petrov] Oh.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.230
Ah.

12:13.357 --> 12:17.027
1945 Mouton-Rothschild.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.280
"V" label.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.495
Rothschild commissioned it
to celebrate the Allied victory

12:26.579 --> 12:28.497
in the Great Patriotic War.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.791
You mean World War II.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.421
Hmm.
I wonder what she was saving this for.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.468
Should we?

12:43.512 --> 12:47.349
Ah, come on. There must be some mischief
in you somewhere.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.894
Do you object?

12:51.520 --> 12:52.772
Not my place.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.649
And where exactly is your place?

12:56.817 --> 12:59.737
I specifically asked
to meet with the president.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.788
Hmm. There must be
a corkscrew somewhere, hmm?

13:09.121 --> 13:11.749
She wouldn't keep these bottles in here
without one.

13:11.832 --> 13:15.002
- When it comes to Syria, Mr. President...
- A moment, please.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.171
Sir...

13:18.964 --> 13:21.425
our only goal is stability,

13:21.884 --> 13:24.011
peace, prosperity for the Syrian people.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.556
We need to re-engage.
We need to re-start talks...

13:27.640 --> 13:28.640
Talks?

13:28.891 --> 13:30.267
Talk, talk, talk.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.020
While you're busy making side deals
with Nexis

13:33.103 --> 13:35.314
and the rest of your Republican friends.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.398
The Shepherds.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.777
That is who you really work for, isn't it?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.947
We can freeze assets,

13:43.614 --> 13:46.367
put sanctions back into place.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.373
Must be about...

13:53.040 --> 13:55.793
7:30 at night in Damascus.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.462
If we do nothing,

13:59.004 --> 14:02.216
by dawn, skirmishes
between our troops and yours will begin.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.928
And once Russian soldiers
start killing American soldiers,

14:07.137 --> 14:09.014
the chaos will continue.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.683
Or...

14:13.018 --> 14:15.178
we can pull out a map of Syria, right here, right now.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.319
And you and I,
like the imperialists we are,

14:22.736 --> 14:24.822
can decide who gets what.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.243
Shall we?

14:30.911 --> 14:32.496
I'll speak to the president.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.711
Whoever decides...

14:40.045 --> 14:41.881
is who you should speak to.

14:46.635 --> 14:50.347
Aww. What a shame.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.563
What a shame.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.841
I talked to Doug. He asked me,

15:26.050 --> 15:28.194
and at first I thought he was just
covering his tracks,

15:28.218 --> 15:30.012
as far as the Secretary's death, but...

15:30.721 --> 15:32.014
Now I wonder...

15:33.057 --> 15:34.683
the nature of his questions.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.269
Ma'am, I've made some calls.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.146
There are some inconsistencies.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.981
When she left her house. Where she died.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.543
- Wait, what are you telling me?
- I'm not saying it isn't true...

15:43.567 --> 15:44.485
Just a second, back up.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.445
It's just hard to be certain
is all I'm saying.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.786
- I'd like you to go find him.
- I can't talk to him again.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.666
My fear is he'll become suspicious.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.543
He knows me as someone
who does what he's told.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.129
I don't understand,
If it's not him, then...

16:05.047 --> 16:06.966
how did she die, for God's sake?

16:08.384 --> 16:09.385
Ma'am...

16:10.344 --> 16:11.595
I don't know.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.776
Mr. Shepherd would like
to be kept informed in real time.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.111
It's under control.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.446
Then it shouldn't be a problem
to keep us included.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.449
Do you understand how long
I've known the Shepherds?

16:32.783 --> 16:35.828
Whatever you discussed with Petrov
needs to be run by him.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.080
Let me enlighten you
about something, Mr. Grayson.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.417
I do not need you to convey a message
between me and Bill Shepherd, okay?

16:41.500 --> 16:44.211
Well, that's preferable,
as long as, and forgive me,

16:44.294 --> 16:47.715
you make no decisions
when it comes to Syria without his say-so.

16:47.798 --> 16:51.918
- Don't get over your skis, sir.
- We're done here. - I don't think... - The vice president says we are done.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.435
[Linda] Doug Stamper.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.982
Linda. How are you?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.193
- You weren't at the funeral.
- I arrived late.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.113
Out of politics, I understand?

17:11.195 --> 17:13.574
President Walker made sure
I had a soft landing.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.992
I'm at a university in Colorado,

17:16.076 --> 17:19.496
where the water is fresh
and the air is clean.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.332
- Hmm. Sounds dangerous.
- It is.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.126
To think that clearly.

17:24.917 --> 17:25.919
How are you?

17:27.087 --> 17:28.338
What have you read?

17:28.672 --> 17:29.673
About you?

17:30.466 --> 17:31.550
Most of it.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.927
The last three months of it.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.264
About your supposed confession.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.143
What more could I possibly add
that you haven't already read?

17:41.226 --> 17:44.480
There's what you read,
and there's the truth.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.066
I'm not ashamed.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.986
The time away led me
to finally realize who I am.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.158
Does the congressman know about you?

17:56.700 --> 17:57.700
I mean... know.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.790
With my help he's gonna be
the next speaker of the House...

18:02.873 --> 18:05.292
I went to law school
with the US Attorney.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.419
She's tired of waiting.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.840
She's issuing a subpoena
with your name on it sometime tomorrow.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.760
Tell her what you know.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.097
You have a chance
to survive all this, Doug.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.686
[speaking Russian] Tartus, yes?

18:25.896 --> 18:27.731
But the rest of the coast...

18:28.440 --> 18:31.610
can we afford to let it go?

18:33.779 --> 18:34.780
Goodbye.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.270
- It could work.
- [phone beeps]

18:37.074 --> 18:39.785
Petrov has plans to expand the Naval base

18:39.868 --> 18:41.245
to the port of Tartus.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.622
The only reason
he's propping up the regime

18:43.705 --> 18:45.082
is because they control the coast.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.708
He needs the ports.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.337
Force him to fight for those
and he'll leave the rest of Syria alone.

18:52.881 --> 18:53.881
Mark...

18:55.926 --> 18:57.052
the moment is here.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.303
He's here.

18:59.138 --> 18:59.972
It can't wait.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.433
I still don't understand how agreements
which haven't even been finalized yet...

19:03.517 --> 19:05.811
- Doesn't matter. He got wind of it.
- From who?

19:06.728 --> 19:08.772
The point is, is he is a greedy...

19:08.856 --> 19:12.067
- Motherfucker, yes.
- And greedy motherfuckers always find out.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.862
He's relentless.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.700
I spent two years
in the Kurdish northwest,

19:19.783 --> 19:22.161
outfitted rebels in the southeast.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.165
I know every angle
Petrov will keep in play.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.586
He has a sixth sense
when it comes to hesitation.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.966
- If you need me to be in there...
- [laughs]

19:36.049 --> 19:38.135
You just can't do it, can you?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
What? Nothing.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.767
- Mark...
- You just can't step back and trust.

19:46.476 --> 19:47.769
I trust you, Mark.

19:48.645 --> 19:52.107
But if the backseat president
is gonna take the wheel, you gotta drive.

19:55.235 --> 19:58.071
There's a reason you and I
are alone in the world, Jane.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.827
Yes, of course.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.832
- How long?
- A lifetime.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.920
You moved out west, right?
More time with your son.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.504
As much as he'll give me.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.174
- And is he still enjoying Stan...
- Claire.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.426
Madam President,

20:19.635 --> 20:21.887
we don't need to exchange pleasantries.

20:23.847 --> 20:27.434
These days I tend to think a lot
about what might have been.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.270
I'd like to apologize.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.523
- For what?
- My one regret.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.944
I should've been there in Gaffney.

20:37.861 --> 20:38.946
Honestly,

20:39.321 --> 20:40.697
it's been haunting me.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.908
There was something he needed to know.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.285
It was a mistake.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.831
Overlooking Francis
for secretary of state.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.750
- Linda, it's water under the bridge.
- No.

20:52.793 --> 20:53.794
No.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.004
If we hadn't,

20:56.421 --> 20:57.631
I don't know.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.133
Maybe everything
would have been different.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.970
For who?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.388
This country.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.600
Obviously, there's no way for me
to tell him that now.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.144
The least I can do is tell you.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.438
There is no need for that.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.316
How do you expect to separate yourself
from his crimes?

21:17.317 --> 21:21.196
As corrupt as these politics
we put up with have become...

21:21.738 --> 21:25.284
[scoffs]
how can the people against you not use it?

21:27.703 --> 21:30.122
You thought you got away
with it all, Claire.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.416
But that remains to be seen.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.423
Everything happens exactly as it should.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.217
Nice seeing you.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.567
[Jane] What are you up to?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.405
I'm thinking about mortality.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.533
I think a lot of us are doing that today.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.577
We're about to have a meeting.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.038
I can't be a part of it.
Viktor knows me all too well.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.497
I'm on board.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.501
Claire, I see you.
I told Mark not to worry about it.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.396
But I have an inkling
that's not necessarily...

22:18.420 --> 22:20.547
Spare me your inkling, Jane.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.718
This deal is for your own good.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.470
It's about the whole region.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.889
Our presence. Our authority.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.851
Mark and Marcy can do the heavy lifting.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.190
Help me prevent a war
from happening today.

22:39.149 --> 22:42.736
Any more instability and everybody loses.
Help me avert that.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.282
I promise you...

22:48.241 --> 22:51.870
I will chip away
at Bill and Annette Shepherd.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.375
Because the only way
to truly take them down

22:57.959 --> 22:59.753
is one piece at a time.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.344
What do you think really happened
to Cathy?

23:14.851 --> 23:16.019
Okay.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.481
I guess you got lucky then.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.735
No one is that lucky.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.742
The president is willing
to leave the coast uncontested.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.078
- Tartus...
- That port is already ours.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.413
[Mark] And will remain so.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.332
We'll keep our forces away
from the entire Western coast.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.709
This will give you unfettered access
to the Mediterranean.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.379
- No.
- Sir, the Sixth Fleet is en route.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.005
- No.
- If you want a naval standoff...

23:44.089 --> 23:46.299
No! Let's not pretend.

23:46.383 --> 23:49.428
What's really at stake here
is your country lining its pockets and...

23:49.511 --> 23:50.679
[knocks on door]

23:51.930 --> 23:53.181
Madam President,

23:53.265 --> 23:54.808
Mr. President,

23:55.142 --> 23:57.686
- the vice president asked me to join.
- Mr. Grayson...

23:57.769 --> 23:58.937
[Seth] On behalf of a company

23:59.020 --> 24:01.060
- with subsidiaries in the Middle East.
- Excuse me.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.358
We want to ensure
that we're part of the solution.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.611
This will signal to the world
that Russia is back.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.381
- Russia's back?
- [Nora] Mr. Vice President,

24:08.405 --> 24:11.366
there are terms being negotiated here
that need to be discussed...

24:11.450 --> 24:12.534
Christ!

24:13.452 --> 24:17.080
If Secretary Durant were here,
we'd be long past this posturing

24:17.164 --> 24:19.833
- and dealing with the real question.
- Yes, peace in the region.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.793
Peace? Really?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.713
You want to use peace to decide

24:24.796 --> 24:28.467
who will rebuild this <i>pizdets?</i>

24:28.717 --> 24:30.427
[Mark]
I don't understand what that means,

24:30.510 --> 24:33.805
- Mr. President.
- That means clusterfuck.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.349
Sir, stability in the region
helps all of us.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.060
You want to give me the West
and take the East?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.646
That's a first.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.398
So, here's what I want.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.734
The ports, yes, of course.

24:45.817 --> 24:50.322
But I also want Russian exclusivity
on all offshore oil and gas exploration.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.908
- [Seth] I think we need to wait.
- Shut up.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.333
We can't be in a position
where we can get in,

24:55.368 --> 24:56.768
and we can't get our resources out.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.039
[Petrov] If history
has taught us anything, it's that

24:59.122 --> 25:01.291
the Americans always find a way to leave,

25:01.374 --> 25:03.126
no matter what it costs them.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.835
So...

25:05.962 --> 25:08.632
thoughts, Madam President?

25:12.135 --> 25:13.470
Anything?

25:19.142 --> 25:21.269
I concur with the vice president.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.023
[Petrov] Hmm.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.070
I believe we have much to consider.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.626
Playing incompetent is so exhausting.

25:47.879 --> 25:48.797
Hey.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.109
Here's a copy of the president's remarks
for the secretary's memorial this evening.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.635
I already have a copy.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.887
It includes the changes she made
in the car.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.764
Right. Thank you.

26:00.767 --> 26:04.312
Hey. Is it true Tom Yates is missing?

26:04.646 --> 26:06.022
I believe so.

26:06.356 --> 26:10.527
Oh. Is it true he had an affair
with somebody in the White House?

26:11.236 --> 26:12.445
Was it you?

26:12.737 --> 26:14.281
Excuse me.

26:17.450 --> 26:18.660
I'll look through this.

26:19.953 --> 26:20.953
[scoffs]

26:25.917 --> 26:27.919
[birds chirping]

26:32.340 --> 26:33.340
[Claire] Thank you.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.639
- I don't like liars.
- Me neither.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.284
Why would you let me believe...

26:41.308 --> 26:44.436
It seemed like you wanted me
to be the one responsible for Cathy.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.022
That it might be useful to you somehow.

26:50.233 --> 26:53.653
Every time I plan to quit,
something happens.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.908
Francis would certainly be disappointed
in me.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.080
Terrible habit.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.876
Helped me though when I quit drinking.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.964
Don't say anything
to the US attorney, Doug.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.841
She's working with the Shepherds.

27:16.217 --> 27:19.971
I pardon you tonight, and anything else
she has will be my problem.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.892
I'll always be a problem for you.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.810
What do you want from me, Doug?

27:26.311 --> 27:28.396
You're the one
with all the leverage here.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.525
Congressman Cole.
I'll put him on my ticket 2020.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.362
Mark won't survive, I'm sure of it.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.073
2024, Brett Cole will be the president.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.200
And you will be back in the White House.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.663
We can make him president,

27:45.914 --> 27:47.707
just like we did with Francis.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.044
Cole will mean a split ticket.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.756
And that might be the very best thing
for this country.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.136
Pardon Francis as well.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.558
If I do that, I could get impeached.

28:05.642 --> 28:06.642
No.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.855
You're a survivor.
You've proven that much.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.692
Pardon him as well.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.029
Bill's gonna hate anything

28:18.113 --> 28:20.073
even approaching a partnership
with the Kremlin.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.866
It's his sister who holds a grudge.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.618
But still, you have no choice.

28:24.661 --> 28:28.206
I mean, in my experience,
once the chaos tips into forever,

28:28.289 --> 28:29.290
you've got nothing.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.292
And we're very close to forever.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.215
And she said nothing.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.720
It really bothers you, doesn't it?

28:41.803 --> 28:43.555
When you can't figure a person out.

28:44.180 --> 28:47.267
- Especially when you're attracted.
- Oh, my God, what are you...

28:48.810 --> 28:52.105
I am not involved with Claire Underwood.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.899
I'm talking about Annette.

28:55.984 --> 29:00.344
I'm not involved with anyone at the moment. Every time
I see the both of you together, it brings back memories.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.741
[Mark scoffs]

29:03.783 --> 29:06.161
Never thought you'd step out
from behind the scenes.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.913
Well, wherever I can do the most good,
Congressman.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.374
[scoffs] He hasn't changed. Not at all.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.917
Blessing and a curse.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.421
I haven't forgotten
everything you did for me.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.841
Oh, you made it to the House
with or without me.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.468
You showed me the way.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.637
Well...

29:25.138 --> 29:26.890
I've been meaning to say hello,

29:27.515 --> 29:30.101
ever since you left the party
and went to the other side.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.313
Jane.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.155
Haven't spoken to him in over a decade.

29:42.238 --> 29:43.364
He knows.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.074
He knows I was involved.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.535
Well, weren't you?

29:49.329 --> 29:50.413
Weren't we?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.710
When's the last time you were in my house?

29:58.087 --> 29:59.087
Don't.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.635
Mark, I'm not going back there.

30:05.595 --> 30:09.057
No, no, Tom Yates was sleeping
with the new press secretary

30:09.140 --> 30:10.475
in the White House.

30:16.272 --> 30:18.358
He traded the East for the West.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.654
Yes, all offshore oil
and gas exploration, sir.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.591
They're saying we'll still have access,

30:26.658 --> 30:28.803
but all shipping through the Mediterranean
will be affected.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.621
And there's no denying
we'll be somewhat at their mercy.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.252
Because there wasn't time to consult you.

30:40.630 --> 30:45.134
Petrov upped the ante and it looks like
the vice president is going to cave.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.973
It's not a complicated question,
Miss Stewart.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.933
Were you sleeping with him?

30:54.727 --> 30:58.356
Do I need to say this administration
has taken a huge chance on you?

30:58.439 --> 31:00.817
- Were you sleeping...
- It is none of your business.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.900
Well...

31:02.360 --> 31:04.529
- that answers that, then.
- [scoffs]

31:06.155 --> 31:08.950
This is exactly the kind of thing
the White House needs...

31:11.411 --> 31:12.537
to avoid.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.002
And Tom Yates is missing.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.797
Which only makes the whole story
more problematic.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.761
I have no idea
where any of this is coming from.

31:24.799 --> 31:27.927
Well, I suggest you find
a more convincing way of denying it.

31:28.845 --> 31:32.557
Because your inability to lie
is a liability, right?

31:36.769 --> 31:39.147
Now, where is our president?

31:43.026 --> 31:45.236
Why didn't you tell them I invited you?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.114
You didn't rat me out.

31:48.197 --> 31:50.825
You sound like a gangster,
Madam President.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.454
Curiosity, I suppose.

31:54.537 --> 31:56.789
I wanted to watch you

31:57.832 --> 31:58.875
and hear them.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.171
Your vice president
is serving too many masters.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.009
Strange, hmm?

32:09.719 --> 32:12.764
Cathy passing away so soon after Francis.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.183
Death usually comes in threes.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.270
Except when it comes in fours or fives.

32:20.563 --> 32:23.232
Are you free now, Madam President?

32:25.443 --> 32:26.486
Not quite.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.740
Were you happy with what they proposed?

32:31.074 --> 32:32.742
Mostly, I'm just curious.`

32:33.034 --> 32:34.869
Hmm. About what?

32:34.953 --> 32:38.039
What you're about to offer.
That is why you invited me.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.583
- And that is why I said yes.
- Hmm.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.086
Well, Nexis Securities

32:43.836 --> 32:48.007
or any other contractor
connected to Shepherd Unlimited

32:48.925 --> 32:52.261
will never be allowed in Syria
while I'm president.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.681
That's a strong declaration.

32:55.556 --> 32:58.226
Bids will be contingent on my approval.

32:59.018 --> 33:01.229
You can have the oil and gas, the ports.

33:01.312 --> 33:05.191
And 20% of profits
from the resources passing through.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.819
That's...

33:08.820 --> 33:10.655
That's quite a taste.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.201
Maybe you are a gangster.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.538
And how will you...

33:19.080 --> 33:20.957
defend your position?

33:22.875 --> 33:23.875
Peace.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.172
Isn't that what our two countries

33:28.256 --> 33:31.384
have used to justify what we've done
in the region for over a hundred years?

33:31.759 --> 33:33.344
Peace is overrated, Claire.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.430
So are my vice president's promises.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.849
And yet, yours seem too generous.

33:41.436 --> 33:47.233
Your husband would have lost himself
in the brightness of this day,

33:47.316 --> 33:49.652
blinded by how he needed to be seen.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.488
That always cost him.

33:53.656 --> 33:54.824
Can I ask?

33:56.617 --> 33:58.286
If you knew this...

34:00.621 --> 34:02.081
why did you marry him?

34:04.417 --> 34:05.710
Do you even know?

34:09.338 --> 34:10.715
As it turns out...

34:11.424 --> 34:13.760
my husband was a means to an end.

34:16.721 --> 34:17.721
Hmm.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.860
[cell phone keyboard clicking]

34:30.943 --> 34:33.321
Tell the people you work for
that I'm not going to testify.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.447
- [Seth] A second.
- [keyboard clicking continues]

34:35.531 --> 34:36.531
Seth.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.827
- [message sent chime]
- Seth, do you hear me?

34:40.328 --> 34:41.579
Back off, Doug.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.706
Whatever you told them,
I'll have no part of it.

34:45.123 --> 34:47.668
The U.S. Attorney can subpoena me.
She can try to...

34:51.630 --> 34:52.632
I'm done.

34:54.550 --> 34:57.553
You wouldn't know a good thing
if it smacked you in the face.

34:59.722 --> 35:01.641
I don't know why I'm trying to help you.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.687
You're not
in the White House anymore, Doug.

35:12.568 --> 35:14.362
Oh. Where were you?

35:14.737 --> 35:17.577
Even presidents need to pee, Mark. Look, there's a rumor flying around.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.494
- Was it good?
- It's easily dismissible.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.830
Then I talked to NSA.
It's not gonna work, Claire.

35:23.913 --> 35:27.125
Some White House affair
is not gonna make it go away.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.837
The dead never really stay dead, Mark.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.589
Not for the people who loved them.

35:44.433 --> 35:45.726
[sighs]

35:46.644 --> 35:48.437
- Ah. Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

35:52.441 --> 35:53.985
Did you get taller?

35:54.610 --> 35:55.653
Yes.

35:56.696 --> 35:57.989
So strange

35:58.072 --> 36:01.117
for someone trapped in a Napoleon complex.

36:01.200 --> 36:05.538
If only your personality
matched your looks, Jane Davis.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.751
I was surprised you left negotiations

36:10.835 --> 36:14.130
to your surrogate Ms. Siegerson.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.632
Always best to speak for oneself.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.801
Hmm. That's rich, coming from you.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.262
Doublespeak is your mother tongue.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.181
And subterfuge is yours.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.726
You and your agencies, hmm?

36:27.727 --> 36:32.064
The CIA is nothing short
of a cultural terrorist.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.065
It's men like you...

36:33.149 --> 36:35.443
Barging into countries
you know nothing about.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.571
- You get under my skin.
- Profiting from destabilization.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.907
Leaving nothing but ruin in your wake.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.409
- It's chemical, it's...
- And then you're offended...

36:43.492 --> 36:46.370
You're offended when it's my men,
my air strikes,

36:46.454 --> 36:48.098
- that bring some kind of order.
- Chemical!

36:48.122 --> 36:52.251
You are nothing but a communist
in a handmade suit.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.586
A pig!

36:58.132 --> 36:59.759
So emotional.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.512
Emotions make deals come apart, Jane.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.389
Tell me,

37:05.473 --> 37:09.310
why should I trust any deal
that involves you?

37:18.486 --> 37:21.197
[speaking Russian] I will not rest

37:21.822 --> 37:23.908
until you're done, Viktor.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.954
Dead and buried.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.083
Bastard! Then I guess...

37:37.213 --> 37:38.673
you'll never rest.

37:51.477 --> 37:54.647
Okay. My directions were clear.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.774
- No doubt.
- So where's the confusion?

37:57.149 --> 37:59.610
Well, I'm guessing somewhere between
what you wanted to happen

37:59.694 --> 38:01.195
and what had to happen.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.049
If you didn't want me to call Bill,
you shouldn't have given me a reason to.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.825
There was no place for you in that room.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.508
And unless you show some proper respect,

38:07.535 --> 38:09.370
no place for you
in this whole fucking town.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.663
I'll see to that personally.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.123
I'll keep that in mind.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.959
From now on, stay in your lane,
keep your mouth shut,

38:15.042 --> 38:16.752
unless I say otherwise. You got it?

38:17.378 --> 38:19.588
Again, coming in clear,

38:20.506 --> 38:21.632
but not a dent.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.593
It's okay, we'll get there.

38:25.386 --> 38:28.180
Even if we don't, fuck do I care?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.558
I don't work for you.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.477
We both work for him.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.901
Mr. Stamper.

38:44.113 --> 38:48.451
We usually meet
under more orchestrated circumstances.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.745
Not that this isn't one of those, as well.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.081
Where do you find yourself these days?

38:54.373 --> 38:56.709
Consulting for an ambitious Congressman.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.044
Midterms are coming.

38:58.544 --> 38:59.544
I bet...

39:00.588 --> 39:03.674
he has no idea
how well you see in the dark.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.887
Who do you fear most?

39:09.221 --> 39:10.598
Out of all of them.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.518
Her.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.450
- I can't eat at these things, either.
- [chuckles]

39:36.499 --> 39:38.626
The spread looks lovely. Everything.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.836
You all did right by her.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.421
Well, I didn't do a thing.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.549
Stan took care of all of it.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.305
[Doug] How you holding up?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.768
I can't make sense of it.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.522
[Doug]
My dad went the same way, you know?

40:01.649 --> 40:03.692
Never sick a day in his life. And then...

40:06.237 --> 40:07.822
Right when he was driving,

40:08.364 --> 40:10.804
just drifted onto oncoming traffic.
- Jesus. - Oh, my goodness.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.453
I had to quickly grab the wheel

40:14.537 --> 40:16.288
and swerved us over to the shoulder.

40:17.331 --> 40:18.791
How old were you?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.126
Twelve.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.505
Twelve. That's rough.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.632
[Doug] It's all rough.

40:27.299 --> 40:28.717
Twelve. Twenty-one.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.136
Fifty-one.

40:31.846 --> 40:32.972
You're never ready.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.399
Wednesday afternoon she calls me,
as she does.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.109
Said her head hurt.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.486
Like migraine bad, so she...

40:48.320 --> 40:50.781
was headed to her personal doctor.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.161
I call back to see how she was doing.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.954
Stan hits me with it.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.292
She didn't even make it to the office.
It happened in the car.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.378
So, I got on the first flight out.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.797
Hey, it's okay.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.299
[Claire] Doug's right.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.135
It's fine, let it out.

41:16.515 --> 41:18.893
By the time I landed, it was all done.

41:20.811 --> 41:21.937
Body was...

41:23.022 --> 41:25.357
whatever, at the place...

41:26.650 --> 41:27.735
to get cremated.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.738
No autopsy, nothing.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.990
Stan made it happen so fast.

41:38.787 --> 41:42.291
And I'm the only one who can't
keep his shit together. But it's just...

41:43.334 --> 41:47.630
I never got the chance to see her.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.635
To say goodbye. [sobbing]

41:52.718 --> 41:54.518
I'm sorry.
You all didn't ask for any of this.

41:54.887 --> 41:57.014
- [Claire] No. Please.
- [Doug] We get it.

41:58.182 --> 42:02.144
Yes, Doug Stamper and the president
seem very much in sync.

42:03.938 --> 42:04.772
Mm-hmm.

42:04.855 --> 42:08.567
I was hoping to attend
the secretary's memorial as well,

42:08.651 --> 42:10.486
but my time is limited.

42:10.569 --> 42:13.030
It was meaningful
that you traveled all this way.

42:13.113 --> 42:15.115
I've been thinking about
what you said to me.

42:17.993 --> 42:19.161
I accept.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.748
I'm so happy to hear that.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.502
One other thing. Tom Yates.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.506
Your government was behind
whatever happened to him.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.147
Presidents aren't allowed to be human.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.942
You have to choose. Power or love.

42:50.609 --> 42:52.820
That was very clear from the beginning.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.656
Forgive me, Tom Yates.

42:56.031 --> 43:01.120
I'm about to drag you through the mud
to deny we ever happened.

43:01.829 --> 43:04.623
I'm killing you for the second time.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.876
One day, you'll rest in peace.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.086
Madam President.

43:11.130 --> 43:13.924
Ma'am, I have to tell you

43:14.550 --> 43:16.844
- there are rumors circulating...
- I know, I know.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.806
- If you need me to resign...
- Kelsey, you're not going anywhere.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.127
[Hammerschmidt] <i>You can stay
at my place as long as you like.</i>

43:27.813 --> 43:29.189
I appreciate it.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.400
Two weeks in Bellport

43:31.483 --> 43:32.610
tapped me out.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.529
Well, your paper will cover some of that.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.157
[laughs] They don't do expenses, Tom.

43:40.618 --> 43:44.079
And my mom didn't have much to leave.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.666
I liked the piece.

43:48.834 --> 43:49.834
It was strong.

43:50.794 --> 43:52.421
What's your follow-up?

43:52.504 --> 43:55.549
Well, it's not like anybody
at the EPA can confirm.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.510
Well, if the emails exist,
they went to somebody.

43:58.594 --> 44:01.639
Yeah, but my only source
won't return my calls.

44:02.514 --> 44:06.143
He's gotta show up to work every day.
He's afraid. He should be.

44:10.814 --> 44:12.191
Follow up with the app.

44:13.192 --> 44:17.571
Grayson was there,
signing up people who were very scared.

44:18.238 --> 44:19.740
They took advantage of a crisis.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.743
- The Shepherds.
- It's unethical, but it's not illegal.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.413
Oh, shit.

44:27.164 --> 44:29.249
They shut down Pennsylvania Avenue.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.879
[phone keyboard clicking]

44:35.339 --> 44:37.966
It says to take Massachusetts.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.009
All right.

44:43.889 --> 44:46.058
It's Cathy Durant's memorial today.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.230
The bodies are adding up.

44:56.360 --> 45:00.030
Tom, from the very beginning,
we did what we thought was right.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.452
At the time, anyway.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.588
Is that how we ended up
in this car together?

45:07.663 --> 45:09.373
Look, you cannot blame yourself for...

45:09.456 --> 45:10.874
For not doing enough. Why not?

45:10.958 --> 45:12.042
Why shouldn't I?

45:12.126 --> 45:13.043
Rachel Posner?

45:13.127 --> 45:16.046
Somebody with her name is bouncing checks
in and around New Mexico.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.382
Yeah. And if it leads to nowhere?

45:23.595 --> 45:25.347
Will you ever be able to...

45:25.848 --> 45:26.848
leave it?

45:27.850 --> 45:29.852
If the truth starts to fade away?

45:31.520 --> 45:32.604
Truthfully...

45:36.066 --> 45:37.192
I don't know.

45:44.783 --> 45:47.786
I just heard from Bugayev. 20%?

45:48.829 --> 45:52.833
I haven't told Mark and the rest yet.
Just know you'll be crucified.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.002
Yes, and how will I feel the difference?

45:55.836 --> 45:57.880
You shouldn't have excluded me.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.053
[camera shutters clicking]

46:05.512 --> 46:07.556
What's going on with you and Claire?

46:09.016 --> 46:11.977
Look, I can only assume
while you were away

46:12.060 --> 46:14.396
somebody broke down
the definition of insanity.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.607
If not, here's a refresher.

46:17.065 --> 46:21.612
Doing the same shit over and over
and expecting different results.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.616
Yeah, I don't know what she told you

46:25.699 --> 46:27.493
to induce such amnesia,

46:27.951 --> 46:30.329
but if you're seriously
looking down that road again,

46:30.412 --> 46:33.248
there is something that you should know
about Francis' will.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.584
Has she told you what's in it?

46:36.585 --> 46:37.795
Who told you?

46:38.253 --> 46:40.881
If I were you, that's not the question
I'd be asking right now.

46:41.298 --> 46:45.469
I'd be asking, "Why is she keeping me
from the truth?"

46:47.638 --> 46:49.890
He left you more than those cuff links.

46:52.518 --> 46:53.977
You're welcome, Doug.

47:02.277 --> 47:03.654
President Underwood,

47:03.737 --> 47:04.863
Brett Cole.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.532
Yes, I know who you are.

47:07.032 --> 47:08.367
I'll take that as a compliment.

47:08.867 --> 47:11.245
Madam President,
you should make your way to the stage.

47:11.328 --> 47:12.788
Yes, of course. Thank you.

47:12.871 --> 47:13.871
Doug.

47:15.916 --> 47:18.210
- Speak soon?
- Yes, ma'am.

47:20.337 --> 47:21.672
Anything you need to tell me now?

47:22.047 --> 47:23.715
Nope, nothing.

47:25.634 --> 47:27.928
That story about your father,
is that true?

47:31.849 --> 47:32.975
Does it matter?

47:33.517 --> 47:35.686
Well, if it's true, it explains a lot.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.231
If it's not, it explains a lot.

47:52.327 --> 47:53.829
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry.

47:53.912 --> 47:55.163
I appreciate it.

47:56.707 --> 47:57.707
So sorry.

48:00.335 --> 48:01.461
Good to see you.

48:27.112 --> 48:31.116
[Claire] <i>To weather the slings and arrows
of 30 years of service</i>

48:31.199 --> 48:33.410
<i>and not lose a fraction</i>

48:33.493 --> 48:36.413
<i>of one's signature grit and integrity,</i>

48:36.830 --> 48:38.707
<i>that's not a legacy,</i>

48:39.416 --> 48:40.834
<i>that's a miracle.</i>

48:41.460 --> 48:44.963
<i>But Catherine Durant
wasn't just a Secretary of State.</i>

48:45.923 --> 48:47.090
<i>She was a sister.</i>

48:47.591 --> 48:50.469
[speaking French]
Why isn't someone on the house right now?

48:51.345 --> 48:53.138
Well, then you heard wrong.

48:53.221 --> 48:55.182
That's right. Day and night.

48:55.641 --> 49:00.854
[speaking English] Yes, every second
until he is on the C-130 to Switzerland.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.940
No, no, no. No ETAs.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.524
Hard dates and times.

49:05.817 --> 49:06.818
Mm-hmm.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.781
Mm-hmm. Correct.

49:11.990 --> 49:12.824
No.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.243
I'll be the one
to intercept him in Annecy.

49:15.827 --> 49:18.997
Yes, of course. As soon as the money
is wired, you'll be taken care of.
