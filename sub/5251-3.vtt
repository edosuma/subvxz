00:04.033 --> 00:06.067
>> CAITLYN: I am so honored to

00:06.067 --> 00:06.933
be part of this community.

00:06.933 --> 00:07.567
>> WOMAN: Are we supposed to

00:07.567 --> 00:08.300
haze her?

00:08.300 --> 00:09.233
(laughter)

00:09.233 --> 00:10.233
>> CAITLYN: I finally feel like

00:10.233 --> 00:11.233
I fit in somewhere.

00:11.233 --> 00:12.233
>> KYLIE: Lean back.

00:12.233 --> 00:13.233
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

00:13.233 --> 00:14.233
Could be Caitlyn's first post.

00:14.233 --> 00:15.233
>> KYLIE: What do you want to

00:15.233 --> 00:16.367
say?

00:16.367 --> 00:17.633
>> CAITLYN: Okay... My dad?

00:17.633 --> 00:18.900
(laughter)

00:18.900 --> 00:19.900
>> KIM: All right, can I see

00:19.900 --> 00:21.333
these new things in your closet?

00:21.333 --> 00:22.333
>> CAITLYN: I love this Tom Ford

00:22.333 --> 00:23.667
dress.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.033
>> KIM: Mom has that.

00:25.033 --> 00:26.100
(laughs)

00:26.100 --> 00:27.467
>> CAITLYN: That is funny.

00:27.467 --> 00:28.667
Road trip!

00:28.667 --> 00:29.700
(people cheering)

00:29.700 --> 00:31.300
>> WOMAN: Viva la road trip.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.400
>> CHANDI: How does it feel?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.400
>> CAITLYN: Free! To be here,

00:33.400 --> 00:34.433
with all of you, is nothing

00:34.433 --> 00:35.867
but good.

00:35.867 --> 00:36.867
Everybody seems to have pretty

00:36.867 --> 00:37.867
good vocal chords.

00:37.867 --> 00:38.867
That's always been a concern for

00:38.867 --> 00:39.867
me.

00:39.867 --> 00:40.867
>> WOMAN: I worked really hard.

00:40.867 --> 00:43.200
I hated being outed by my voice.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.333
>> WOMAN 2: She's never had a

00:44.333 --> 00:45.333
girls night like this.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.333
>> RHONDA: I feel kind of

00:46.333 --> 00:47.333
jealous.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.333
>> WOMAN: There are all these

00:48.333 --> 00:49.333
trans women out there in real

00:49.333 --> 00:50.367
danger.

00:50.367 --> 00:51.700
Most people don't have what she

00:51.700 --> 00:53.600
has, and she may be oblivious.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.133
>> ANGELICA: I've been

00:55.133 --> 00:56.567
transitioning since I was 19.

00:56.567 --> 00:57.733
I still haven't been able to

00:57.733 --> 00:59.700
access what you've been able to

00:59.700 --> 01:01.467
access so quickly.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.200
>> BLOSSOM: Let's just be real.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.233
It has something to do with your

01:04.233 --> 01:06.133
socio-economical status.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.433
You're up there.

01:07.433 --> 01:09.400
Come down with everybody else.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.567
>> ANGELICA: A lot of people who

01:16.567 --> 01:17.967
want to be seen as heroes and

01:17.967 --> 01:19.067
want to, like, save our

01:19.067 --> 01:20.267
community.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.367
They want these kind of direct,

01:21.367 --> 01:22.367
wrap a bow around it, now this

01:22.367 --> 01:23.400
person's all better and they

01:23.400 --> 01:24.433
have a job.

01:24.433 --> 01:25.733
(indistinct arguing)

01:25.733 --> 01:26.933
>> ALISON: Trans people have

01:26.933 --> 01:28.067
about four times the heightened

01:28.067 --> 01:29.200
extreme poverty rate as the

01:29.200 --> 01:30.633
general population, so that's

01:30.633 --> 01:31.800
very difficult to live

01:31.800 --> 01:34.867
at that level.

01:34.867 --> 01:35.967
>> CHANDI: We made it clear to

01:35.967 --> 01:37.667
Caitlyn that a lot of girls are

01:37.667 --> 01:39.500
going to be jaded, because the

01:39.500 --> 01:41.933
things that Caitlyn has been

01:41.933 --> 01:43.600
able to achieve in a few months,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.433
some of them will never achieve

01:45.433 --> 01:47.533
those things their whole entire

01:47.533 --> 01:48.933
life.

01:48.933 --> 01:50.067
So, taking that into

01:50.067 --> 01:51.667
consideration, Caitlyn is still

01:51.667 --> 01:53.533
wanting to do the work to make a

01:53.533 --> 01:55.533
difference in the community.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.467
Because even us sitting in this

01:57.467 --> 01:59.200
room, right now, have people who

01:59.200 --> 02:01.600
don't like us for their own

02:01.600 --> 02:02.933
individual reasons.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.300
It doesn't have anything to

02:04.300 --> 02:05.567
do... Right! Right! Right!

02:05.567 --> 02:07.467
It has nothing to do with us not

02:07.467 --> 02:09.300
being good people and we can't

02:09.300 --> 02:11.300
allow that to prevent us from

02:11.300 --> 02:12.867
moving forward, doing the work

02:12.867 --> 02:14.167
that we do.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.233
Those are the things that keep

02:15.233 --> 02:16.767
us inspired.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.067
>> CAITLYN: We have to

02:18.067 --> 02:19.167
understand that, yeah,

02:19.167 --> 02:20.600
everybody's different, okay?

02:20.600 --> 02:22.167
Everybody's got issues.

02:22.167 --> 02:23.800
This is our issue, okay?

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
And we're trying to deal with

02:24.800 --> 02:26.100
it, best we possibly can.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.100
>> JENNY: But, you know, we

02:27.100 --> 02:28.167
can't do all this work by

02:28.167 --> 02:29.867
ourselves; we need allies.

02:29.867 --> 02:31.367
Um, there's just not enough

02:31.367 --> 02:33.333
transgender people...

02:33.333 --> 02:34.367
>> LAYA: When I came out, I had

02:34.367 --> 02:35.367
finally transitioned, trying to

02:35.367 --> 02:36.700
be myself and here I am applying

02:36.700 --> 02:37.700
to job, job after job, trying to

02:37.700 --> 02:39.067
get jobs.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.733
And, uh... nothing.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.867
You know, I did, I didn't want

02:42.867 --> 02:44.367
to, like, have to do this, but I

02:44.367 --> 02:45.633
ended up doing a lot of sex

02:45.633 --> 02:46.800
work.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.333
One night I was doing it and

02:48.333 --> 02:50.067
this guy grabs behind the seat,

02:50.067 --> 02:51.533
pulls out a knife and he just

02:51.533 --> 02:52.967
starts stabbing me.

02:52.967 --> 02:54.333
(woman gasps)

02:54.333 --> 02:55.933
So I jumped out and then I hear

02:55.933 --> 02:57.433
screeching.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.133
And the car screeches and turns

02:59.133 --> 03:01.467
around and he's coming back

03:01.467 --> 03:03.367
after me to run me over.

03:03.367 --> 03:05.233
>> ANGELICA: Oh, my God.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.933
>> CHANDI: Society needs to see

03:06.933 --> 03:09.500
us as being normal human beings,

03:09.500 --> 03:11.600
just like the next person.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.733
>> BLOSSOM: I wanted to be in

03:12.733 --> 03:14.300
nursing school so, so bad.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.967
I had a good GPA.

03:15.967 --> 03:17.667
I had a good ACT score.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.067
And, you know, the first time,

03:19.067 --> 03:20.433
I didn't get in.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.733
Okay, so let me work a little

03:21.733 --> 03:22.933
harder.

03:22.933 --> 03:24.067
We took some classes, applied

03:24.067 --> 03:25.067
again.

03:25.067 --> 03:26.233
Still nothing.

03:26.233 --> 03:27.500
And I couldn't get into nursing

03:27.500 --> 03:28.700
school for, like, the sixth

03:28.700 --> 03:30.133
time, because I'm trans--

03:30.133 --> 03:31.567
that people are looking at that.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.067
And you need to be looking at my

03:33.067 --> 03:34.400
hard work and the dedication

03:34.400 --> 03:36.067
that I put into that hard work.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.500
It-it bothers me to this day

03:37.500 --> 03:39.367
when I see those students that I

03:39.367 --> 03:40.867
went to school with in nursing

03:40.867 --> 03:42.300
school, getting those degrees,

03:42.300 --> 03:44.067
and the only reason why I didn't

03:44.067 --> 03:45.600
get in was because I'm trans.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.933
And I make straight A's.

03:46.933 --> 03:48.367
I work hard.

03:48.367 --> 03:49.767
Stop looking on the outside and

03:49.767 --> 03:51.100
start looking on the inside and

03:51.100 --> 03:54.067
seeing that we want to be just

03:54.067 --> 03:55.233
normal people.

03:55.233 --> 03:56.900
>> CAITLYN: I've lived a great

03:56.900 --> 03:58.600
life.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.867
And I realize, in this

03:59.867 --> 04:01.867
transition... that I kind of

04:01.867 --> 04:05.267
have that privileged status.

04:05.267 --> 04:07.467
You were a white guy.

04:07.467 --> 04:09.300
I worked hard.

04:09.300 --> 04:12.700
I've, you know... been able to

04:12.700 --> 04:14.667
put a few dollars away.

04:18.167 --> 04:19.800
So... I'm blessed.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.067
I'm in a wonderful position in

04:22.067 --> 04:24.233
life and boy, oh, boy, what I'm

04:24.233 --> 04:26.400
learning-- unbelievable.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.633
Um, it's shocking to me to see

04:28.633 --> 04:30.367
the struggles that are out

04:30.367 --> 04:32.167
there.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.167
>> BLOSSOM: And everybody knows

04:33.167 --> 04:34.767
I am a big Ellen DeGeneres fan.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.200
Seeing when she first came out

04:36.200 --> 04:38.133
as a lesbian, she had her sitcom

04:38.133 --> 04:39.567
going and, you know, they

04:39.567 --> 04:40.933
cancelled it right after and it

04:40.933 --> 04:42.867
seemed like so many things was

04:42.867 --> 04:44.233
going wrong for her, but then,

04:44.233 --> 04:45.533
at the end, she got The Ellen

04:45.533 --> 04:46.633
DeGeneres Show.

04:46.633 --> 04:47.667
I think about nursing school

04:47.667 --> 04:48.700
that way.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.200
I didn't get it yet, but one

04:50.200 --> 04:51.600
day, I'm gonna get it and I'm

04:51.600 --> 04:52.767
gonna stay in it.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.300
(all talking at once)

04:54.300 --> 04:55.767
>> CAITLYN: Thank you for

04:55.767 --> 04:56.800
sharing that with us.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.767
Thank you.

05:01.900 --> 05:02.900
>> JEN: That was an amazing

05:02.900 --> 05:03.900
afternoon.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.067
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it really was.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.367
>> JEN: Um, life-changing.

05:06.367 --> 05:08.333
>> CAITLYN: Blossom's passion.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.700
I loved her passion.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.400
>> JEN: She's really special.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.067
She's really special.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.167
To see someone who was genuinely

05:15.167 --> 05:17.067
trying, who was working really

05:17.067 --> 05:18.467
hard in school, who was, you

05:18.467 --> 05:19.800
know, getting good grades, who

05:19.800 --> 05:21.167
wanted to do something with her

05:21.167 --> 05:22.767
life, and was still being met

05:22.767 --> 05:24.167
with obstacles, still being told

05:24.167 --> 05:25.400
no.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.700
I think that was really kind of

05:26.700 --> 05:27.700
shocking for Cait, that, like,

05:27.700 --> 05:28.800
oh, gosh, this is true, like,

05:28.800 --> 05:30.733
you as a black trans woman can't

05:30.733 --> 05:32.767
do what you clearly want to do

05:32.767 --> 05:34.333
and should be able to do because

05:34.333 --> 05:35.600
of these intersections of your

05:35.600 --> 05:36.667
identity.

05:36.667 --> 05:37.667
>> CAITLYN: Kind of puts it all

05:37.667 --> 05:38.667
in perspective, doesn't it?

05:38.667 --> 05:40.067
>> JEN: Yeah.

05:40.067 --> 05:41.367
>> CAITLYN: My big problem is

05:41.367 --> 05:42.533
I'm worried about some stupid

05:42.533 --> 05:43.533
paparazzi taking a picture.

05:43.533 --> 05:44.533
>> JEN: We need to have these

05:44.533 --> 05:45.533
conversations.

05:45.533 --> 05:46.533
We can really learn from each

05:46.533 --> 05:48.500
other.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.733
>> CAITLYN: In?

05:59.733 --> 06:01.067
We're... Oh, right here.

06:01.067 --> 06:03.067
Okay.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.067
Hola.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.800
(chuckles)

06:06.800 --> 06:08.733
What did you think of that?

06:08.733 --> 06:10.067
>> JENNY: Amazing.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.600
(all talking at once)

06:11.600 --> 06:13.400
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.667
This is what I want to do.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.067
Uh... I was crying during

06:17.067 --> 06:19.067
Blossom's talk about what she's

06:19.067 --> 06:20.500
been through, okay?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.333
Andrea, you're in this.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.333
Sit right down here.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.333
>> ANDREA: Okay.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.333
>> CAITLYN: Andrea, our

06:25.333 --> 06:26.333
producer.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.933
Um, I want you to take that talk

06:27.933 --> 06:29.867
that she had.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.300
>> ANDREA: Yeah?

06:31.300 --> 06:32.300
>> CAITLYN: I want you to edit

06:32.300 --> 06:33.300
it together.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.300
>> ANDREA: Okay.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.067
>> CAITLYN: Okay, and I want you

06:35.067 --> 06:35.700
to give it to me.

06:35.700 --> 06:36.700
>> ANDREA: You got it.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.233
>> CAITLYN: Okay? Um...

06:38.233 --> 06:39.233
uh, we're gonna get her on

06:39.233 --> 06:40.800
the...

06:40.800 --> 06:42.867
We're gonna get her on The Ellen

06:42.867 --> 06:45.067
DeGeneres Show.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.467
I'm gonna call Ellen.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.833
>> ANDREA: Yeah.

06:47.833 --> 06:49.267
>> CAITLYN: And... she's gonna

06:49.267 --> 06:51.200
go to nursing school and we're

06:51.200 --> 06:53.533
gonna pay for it, okay?

06:53.533 --> 06:54.667
>> ANDREA: That's amazing.

06:54.667 --> 06:55.733
That's amazing.

06:55.733 --> 06:56.733
>> CAITLYN: And we're not gonna

06:56.733 --> 06:57.733
tell her until then.

06:57.733 --> 06:58.733
I guarantee you-- Ellen sees

06:58.733 --> 07:00.467
that story.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.067
She would have her on.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.233
We got to help.

07:03.233 --> 07:04.433
>> ANDREA: That's amazing.

07:04.433 --> 07:05.467
>> CAITLYN: It's a great story.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.467
>> ANDREA: That's a great story.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.467
>> CAITLYN: Okay?

07:07.467 --> 07:08.467
All you got to do is edit it

07:08.467 --> 07:09.700
together.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.533
Come on.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.167
>> CHANDI: Cait, she has the

07:13.167 --> 07:14.933
biggest heart and she wants to

07:14.933 --> 07:17.567
help everyone.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.067
But she cannot save the world.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.333
She's got to work on one person

07:22.333 --> 07:23.867
at a time.

07:23.867 --> 07:25.800
And if she's able to help that

07:25.800 --> 07:27.467
one somebody, then her work is

07:27.467 --> 07:28.833
done.

07:28.833 --> 07:29.833
>> CAITLYN: One at a time, baby!

07:29.833 --> 07:30.833
Get it done.

07:30.833 --> 07:31.833
>> CHANDI: Get it done.

07:31.833 --> 07:32.833
>> CAITLYN: Get it done.

07:32.833 --> 07:33.833
>> CHANDI: Get it done.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.567
Get it done.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.600
>> RONDA: The villa in Sonoma

07:37.600 --> 07:38.667
fell through.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.733
I'm supposed to find a villa in

07:39.733 --> 07:41.100
a day.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.700
It took me weeks.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.433
She's telling me that I'm

07:45.433 --> 07:46.700
supposed to come here and have

07:46.700 --> 07:48.267
fun and-and relax.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.500
And I'm not relaxing.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.633
I'm actually more stressed out

07:50.633 --> 07:51.633
than I need to be.

07:51.633 --> 07:52.633
>> COURTNEY: I don't think she

07:52.633 --> 07:53.767
knows that at all.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.067
And I think she thinks, "I'm so

07:55.067 --> 07:56.933
lucky I get to work and hang out

07:56.933 --> 07:58.433
with my best friend every single

07:58.433 --> 08:00.100
day.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.200
And she thinks you feel the same

08:01.200 --> 08:02.267
exact way.

08:02.267 --> 08:03.267
>> RHONDA: There's no point in

08:03.267 --> 08:04.567
my being here; I'd get more done

08:04.567 --> 08:05.667
if I were at home.

08:05.667 --> 08:06.667
>> COURTNEY: Maybe you just need

08:06.667 --> 08:07.667
to talk to her, 'cause I don't

08:07.667 --> 08:08.667
think she has any idea that you

08:08.667 --> 08:09.667
feel this way.

08:09.667 --> 08:10.667
Because when you're around her,

08:10.667 --> 08:11.667
you're like, "I got it,

08:11.667 --> 08:12.667
I got it..."

08:12.667 --> 08:13.667
>> RHONDA: No, I know, I know, I

08:13.667 --> 08:14.667
know; I do want to talk to her

08:14.667 --> 08:15.667
about it, but at this point, I'm

08:15.667 --> 08:16.667
not gonna talk to her about it

08:16.667 --> 08:17.667
on this trip.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.667
>> COURTNEY: Yeah.

08:18.667 --> 08:19.667
>> RHONDA: This is the first

08:19.667 --> 08:20.733
time she's got out and I want it

08:20.733 --> 08:21.733
to be special for her.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.600
We were best friends.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.100
I took her to the hospitals in

08:25.100 --> 08:26.133
the middle of the night.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.300
>> COURTNEY: I know.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.633
>> RHONDA: I nursed her back to

08:28.633 --> 08:29.667
health.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.833
I did everything for her.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.233
Now she's got all these new

08:33.233 --> 08:34.567
friends and it's, like, she's

08:34.567 --> 08:35.767
just acting like, "Oh, see you

08:35.767 --> 08:37.300
later."

08:37.300 --> 08:39.300
And she doesn't see it;

08:39.300 --> 08:41.267
she doesn't.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.967
>> CAITLYN: Look at Chandi!

08:49.967 --> 08:51.167
>> CHANDI: Put a ring on it.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.233
>> CAITLYN: I hate skates.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.467
Oh!

08:53.467 --> 08:55.233
>> WOMAN: Look at Candis!

08:55.233 --> 08:56.700
She's so good!

08:56.700 --> 08:57.767
>> CHANDI: Some days it's so

08:57.767 --> 08:59.500
heavy, we have to let it go

08:59.500 --> 09:01.967
sometimes and have fun.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.533
(laughing)

09:03.533 --> 09:04.267
>> SKATER (in distance): Ooh!

09:04.267 --> 09:05.967
>> BLOSSOM: Uh-oh.

09:05.967 --> 09:06.967
>> WOMAN: Okay.

09:06.967 --> 09:08.967
Who's more attracted to men?

09:08.967 --> 09:10.233
Raise your hand.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.067
>> CANDIS: Is that a hand?

09:11.067 --> 09:11.800
>> CAITLYN: I-I don't know.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.133
You would feel so much more

09:13.133 --> 09:14.967
feminine if you were with a guy.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.633
>> WOMAN: Wait, what?

09:16.633 --> 09:17.433
>> WOMAN 2: Right.

09:17.433 --> 09:18.133
>> CAITLYN: You gonna date

09:18.133 --> 09:19.433
women, you gonna date men?

09:19.433 --> 09:21.400
I don't know.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.233
>> CANDIS: All right. Ready.

09:30.233 --> 09:32.333
Ready for a roller derby.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.533
(laughing)

09:33.533 --> 09:34.267
>> CAITLYN: My question,

09:34.267 --> 09:34.933
Candis...

09:34.933 --> 09:35.667
>> CANDIS: Yeah?

09:35.667 --> 09:36.567
>> CAITLYN: How did you get that

09:36.567 --> 09:38.133
voice?

09:38.133 --> 09:39.867
>> CANDIS: I just had it.

09:39.867 --> 09:40.933
>> CAITLYN: Just had it?

09:40.933 --> 09:41.967
You never had any adjustments,

09:41.967 --> 09:42.967
nothing?

09:42.967 --> 09:43.767
>> CANDIS: Nothing.

09:43.767 --> 09:44.433
>> CAITLYN: You were just

09:44.433 --> 09:45.633
fortunate to have that voice,

09:45.633 --> 09:46.333
right from the beginning.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.133
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

09:47.133 --> 09:47.867
I work it.

09:47.867 --> 09:48.833
(laughs)

09:48.833 --> 09:49.633
>> CHANDI: I don't know, I like

09:49.633 --> 09:50.367
my voice.

09:50.367 --> 09:51.067
>> CAITLYN: I like your voice,

09:51.067 --> 09:51.733
too-- no...

09:51.733 --> 09:52.467
>> CHANDI: I like my voice.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.200
It works.

09:53.200 --> 09:53.933
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it just, like,

09:53.933 --> 09:54.600
it fits you.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.400
>> CHANDI: 'Cause I know people

09:55.400 --> 09:57.233
who are cisgendered women whose

09:57.233 --> 09:58.633
voices are actually deeper than

09:58.633 --> 09:59.633
mine.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.333
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.367
>> CHANDI: And that's what

10:01.367 --> 10:02.400
people say they clock me for,

10:02.400 --> 10:03.633
is my voice.

10:03.633 --> 10:04.467
>> CANDIS: But you know what?

10:04.467 --> 10:06.467
The more you live with yourself

10:06.467 --> 10:07.967
in a comfortable way, the more

10:07.967 --> 10:09.833
you don't care if people clock

10:09.833 --> 10:10.800
you, you know what I mean?

10:10.800 --> 10:11.567
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, right.

10:11.567 --> 10:12.533
>> JENNY: This-this is it,

10:12.533 --> 10:13.300
people.

10:13.300 --> 10:13.967
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

10:13.967 --> 10:14.733
>>JENNY: Get over it. Right?

10:14.733 --> 10:15.400
>> CANDIS: Get over it.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.067
>> CHANDI: Yeah, totally.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.467
>> JENNY: You know, we're gonna

10:17.467 --> 10:18.500
go just so far but then it's...

10:18.500 --> 10:19.667
everybody else has to meet us.

10:19.667 --> 10:20.333
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

10:20.333 --> 10:21.400
>> JEN: Right, exactly.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.467
People also make up the reasons

10:22.467 --> 10:23.933
they clock you, after they know.

10:23.933 --> 10:24.733
(laughter)

10:24.733 --> 10:25.667
They're like, oh... once you

10:25.667 --> 10:26.467
tell them, "Oh, yeah, I could

10:26.467 --> 10:27.733
tell by your hands, your Adam's

10:27.733 --> 10:28.667
apple, your voice."

10:28.667 --> 10:29.833
But show a guy a random picture

10:29.833 --> 10:31.767
of any regular girl and say,

10:31.767 --> 10:32.800
"She's trans," and they go, "Oh,

10:32.800 --> 10:33.633
yeah, I can tell."

10:33.633 --> 10:34.300
>> JENNY: Oh, yeah.

10:34.300 --> 10:34.967
>> CANDIS: I can tell by her

10:34.967 --> 10:35.633
voice.

10:35.633 --> 10:36.300
>> JEN: I can guarantee you.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.067
They'll be like, "Oh, yeah,

10:37.067 --> 10:37.600
I can tell." (laughs)

10:37.600 --> 10:38.400
>> CANDIS: And I've always been

10:38.400 --> 10:39.133
like, shut the (bleep) up.

10:39.133 --> 10:39.800
>> CHANDI: Right.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.500
>> CANDIS: You don't know

10:40.500 --> 10:41.000
(bleep).

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
(Jen giggles)

10:42.000 --> 10:43.100
>> CANDIS: Sorry I'm swearing.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.400
>> CAITLYN: That's funny.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.567
>> CANDIS: I'm kind of from the

10:45.567 --> 10:48.433
school of thought where-- and I

10:48.433 --> 10:50.300
hope to get Cait here-- your

10:50.300 --> 10:51.300
voice is powerful.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.300
It's who you are.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.600
It's your identity.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.100
You were this other person and

10:56.100 --> 10:58.600
you're allowed to be both.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.133
You're allowed start from one

11:00.133 --> 11:02.533
place and end in another and not

11:02.533 --> 11:04.733
completely erase who you are.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.800
And your voice has a lot to do

11:06.800 --> 11:09.533
with... with who that is.

11:09.533 --> 11:10.700
>> CAITLYN: Let's go!

11:10.700 --> 11:11.867
>> CHANDI: You like ponytails,

11:11.867 --> 11:12.767
Caitlyn?

11:12.767 --> 11:13.500
>> CAITLYN: I... you know what?

11:13.500 --> 11:14.333
This is the first time I've gone

11:14.333 --> 11:15.100
with a ponytail.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.333
>> CHANDI: Okay.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.300
*

11:21.300 --> 11:22.500
>> CLERK: Hi.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.767
>> CAITLYN: 12 to a 13.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.767
>> CLERK: Okay.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.433
>> CAITLYN: Somewhere...

11:25.433 --> 11:26.100
somewhere in there.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.333
>> CLERK: Okay.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.867
*

11:28.867 --> 11:29.667
>> JENNY: Thank you for helping

11:29.667 --> 11:30.367
me.

11:30.367 --> 11:31.367
>> CANDIS: Of course.

11:31.367 --> 11:32.533
>> CAITLYN: I hate skates.

11:32.533 --> 11:33.533
Whoa!

11:33.533 --> 11:34.733
>> CANDIS: Oh, no!

11:34.733 --> 11:36.333
>> CAITLYN: Look at Chandi!

11:36.333 --> 11:37.733
>> CHANDI: Put a ring on it.

11:37.733 --> 11:39.867
Some days are so heavy and it's

11:39.867 --> 11:41.567
always work, work, work, work,

11:41.567 --> 11:43.533
work, so we have to, you know,

11:43.533 --> 11:45.500
let it go sometime and... have

11:45.500 --> 11:47.067
fun.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.300
>> WOMAN: Look at Candis!

11:48.300 --> 11:49.767
She's so good!

11:49.767 --> 11:52.433
>> SINGER: * If there's a God

11:52.433 --> 11:55.100
Surely He wants me to be

11:55.100 --> 11:57.233
* Myself

11:57.233 --> 12:00.967
If there's a God... *

12:00.967 --> 12:01.733
>> CANDIS: Ah.

12:01.733 --> 12:02.667
(Caitlyn whooping)

12:02.667 --> 12:06.700
>> SINGER: * If there's a God!

12:06.700 --> 12:08.067
>> CAITLYN: You and me, we have

12:08.067 --> 12:09.067
a long way to fall.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.367
>> BLOSSOM: Yes! A long way.

12:10.367 --> 12:11.100
>> CAITLYN: So, yeah, yeah.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.067
Sing it.

12:12.067 --> 12:12.833
>> BLOSSOM: You're so tall.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.533
>> CAITLYN: I know.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.800
That's it. Sideways.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
>> BLOSSOM: Thank you, Caitlyn,

12:15.800 --> 12:16.667
for teaching me.

12:16.667 --> 12:17.400
>> CAITLYN: See, when I skate, I

12:17.400 --> 12:18.133
want it to go this way and this

12:18.133 --> 12:18.800
way.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.500
>> BLOSSOM: Okay.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.500
Oh, my gosh, am I skating?

12:20.500 --> 12:21.533
>> CAITLYN: You're skating.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.200
You are skating.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.067
>> BLOSSOM: I'm skating!

12:23.067 --> 12:23.767
>> CAITLYN: Now, where's home

12:23.767 --> 12:24.633
for you?

12:24.633 --> 12:25.467
>> BLOSSOM: Mississippi.

12:25.467 --> 12:26.133
>> CAITLYN: Oh, you live in

12:26.133 --> 12:26.800
Mississippi.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.733
>> BLOSSOM: Yes.

12:27.733 --> 12:28.600
When I graduate, I'll be the

12:28.600 --> 12:29.700
first transgender woman from my

12:29.700 --> 12:30.433
university.

12:30.433 --> 12:31.433
>> CAITLYN: Really?

12:31.433 --> 12:32.100
>> BLOSSOM: Yes.

12:32.100 --> 12:32.800
>> CAITLYN: Now, where are you

12:32.800 --> 12:33.467
going to school?

12:33.467 --> 12:34.133
>> BLOSSOM: Um, I'm at

12:34.133 --> 12:35.067
Mississippi University for Women

12:35.067 --> 12:35.967
now, and when I graduate, I want

12:35.967 --> 12:37.067
to go to DC.

12:37.067 --> 12:37.867
I'm gonna apply for nursing

12:37.867 --> 12:38.800
school again.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.700
I feel like there's so much more

12:39.700 --> 12:41.167
opportunity for me there than in

12:41.167 --> 12:41.833
Mississippi.

12:41.833 --> 12:42.500
>> CAITLYN: In the nursing

12:42.500 --> 12:43.167
world?

12:43.167 --> 12:43.833
>> BLOSSOM: Yeah.

12:43.833 --> 12:44.633
>> CAITLYN: Good!

12:44.633 --> 12:45.900
We all gotta live our dreams.

12:45.900 --> 12:46.733
>> BLOSSOM: That's right.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.767
I might have to go the

12:47.767 --> 12:48.800
alternative route, but I'm gonna

12:48.800 --> 12:50.067
keep going forward.

12:50.067 --> 12:50.800
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.067
>> BLOSSOM: Keep going.

12:53.067 --> 12:54.733
>> CAITLYN: I really can't

12:54.733 --> 12:56.067
imagine what Blossom has gone

12:56.067 --> 12:56.800
through.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.767
I mean, she's worked so hard

12:57.767 --> 12:58.967
to... to do all the right

12:58.967 --> 13:00.900
things, to move forward in life.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.533
The educational system in the

13:02.533 --> 13:05.067
United States, um, needs to

13:05.067 --> 13:07.533
realize that these are just

13:07.533 --> 13:09.300
normal people.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.133
Tomorrow, we've got a villa up

13:10.133 --> 13:11.500
in Sonoma.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.433
We could have a car bring you up

13:12.433 --> 13:13.167
for the day.

13:13.167 --> 13:13.700
>> BLOSSOM: Yeah, I would

13:13.700 --> 13:14.200
love that.

13:14.200 --> 13:14.767
Thank you.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.833
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

13:16.833 --> 13:17.833
>> CHANDI: Ah!

13:17.833 --> 13:18.833
>> BLOSSOM: Uh-oh.

13:18.833 --> 13:20.733
(Chandi laughs)

13:27.400 --> 13:29.667
>> RONDA: Look who's here.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.367
>> ZACKARY: Hi!

13:31.367 --> 13:33.167
>> CAITLYN: Oh!

13:33.167 --> 13:35.833
Well, look who's here!

13:35.833 --> 13:37.433
>> ZACKARY: How are you guys?

13:37.433 --> 13:39.100
>> RONDA: Blossom's here.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.133
>> BLOSSOM: Hello, you guys, hi!

13:40.133 --> 13:41.133
>> CAITLYN: Everybody's talking

13:41.133 --> 13:42.133
about you.

13:42.133 --> 13:43.133
>> BLOSSOM: Hi.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.133
>> ZACKARY: I'm Zackary.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.233
>> BLOSSOM: Hi, I'm Blossom.

13:45.233 --> 13:46.233
Nice to meet you.

13:46.233 --> 13:47.233
>> CAITLYN: Well, let's go up

13:47.233 --> 13:48.233
there.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.200
Let's do it.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.967
>> RONDA: Oh, my God!

14:00.967 --> 14:02.633
>> JEN: This is so gorgeous.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.167
>> RONDA: Let's go inside.

14:04.167 --> 14:05.167
>> CAITLYN: Let's go.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.167
>> RONDA: Remember this was,

14:06.167 --> 14:07.233
like, the last minute.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.233
>> CAITLYN: I love it.

14:08.233 --> 14:09.233
>> JENNY: This is beautiful.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.233
>> ZACKARY: I think we did good.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.233
>> CAITLYN: We did good?

14:11.233 --> 14:12.333
>> RONDA: I didn't totally fail.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.333
>> CAITLYN: Oh, good job.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.333
>> JEN: You did good, honey.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.333
>> CAITLYN: You're back in our

14:15.333 --> 14:16.333
good graces.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.333
>> CANDIS: This is amazing.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.600
>> JEN: Who's going in?

14:18.600 --> 14:19.933
>> RONDA: I am, I am.

14:19.933 --> 14:20.933
You are.

14:20.933 --> 14:22.233
>> WOMAN: Let's go.

14:22.233 --> 14:23.533
>> CAITLYN: Chandi-- party in

14:23.533 --> 14:25.500
the pool.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.233
I've been thinking, "Damn, I'm

14:32.233 --> 14:34.400
feeling way too comfortable."

14:34.400 --> 14:34.900
(laughter)

14:34.900 --> 14:35.800
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.833
>> CHANDI: It's your destiny,

14:36.833 --> 14:37.833
Cait-- what's destined to be

14:37.833 --> 14:38.833
will be.

14:38.833 --> 14:39.833
>> CANDIS: Did you think it

14:39.833 --> 14:41.100
would be this comfortable?

14:41.100 --> 14:42.100
>> CAITLYN: I've been

14:42.100 --> 14:43.833
comfortable by myself my entire

14:43.833 --> 14:44.833
life.

14:44.833 --> 14:45.833
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

14:45.833 --> 14:46.833
>> CAITLYN: This trip, I've been

14:46.833 --> 14:49.667
not in my house, and I've been

14:49.667 --> 14:52.433
out, feeling extraordinarily

14:52.433 --> 14:55.233
comfortable being myself.

14:55.233 --> 14:56.500
And to be honest with you, it's

14:56.500 --> 14:58.400
scary.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.467
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

14:59.467 --> 15:00.600
>> CAITLYN: Because I'm already

15:00.600 --> 15:02.533
thinking, "I don't want to go

15:02.533 --> 15:04.133
back there."

15:04.133 --> 15:05.900
I am really enjoying the peace

15:05.900 --> 15:07.400
and quiet up here.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.833
It is so nice to be free.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.100
In L.A., I have the-the media

15:12.100 --> 15:14.067
coming after me, and there is

15:14.067 --> 15:15.233
no privacy.

15:15.233 --> 15:16.800
And, you know, hey, I get it.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.567
I'm doing this very publicly.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.067
So I can understand that.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.800
But it also can drive you crazy.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.767
I don't want to go back home.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.067
>> CAITLYN: I don't want to go

15:31.067 --> 15:32.200
home-- I'm just having a

15:32.200 --> 15:32.833
wonderful, wonderful time here.

15:32.833 --> 15:33.400
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.400
>> CHANDI: Right.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
>> CAITLYN: With friends and

15:35.400 --> 15:37.500
people that identify with me and

15:37.500 --> 15:38.767
I identify with them, and the

15:38.767 --> 15:39.767
stories we've had.

15:39.767 --> 15:40.767
>> CANDIS: And no matter h-how

15:40.767 --> 15:41.767
many people say they understand

15:41.767 --> 15:42.767
and support...

15:42.767 --> 15:43.767
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

15:43.767 --> 15:44.567
>> CANDIS: ...they don't truly

15:44.567 --> 15:45.567
understand.

15:45.567 --> 15:46.300
>> CAITLYN: Understand... Nobody

15:46.300 --> 15:47.300
understands it like everybody on

15:47.300 --> 15:47.800
this trip.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.800
>> CANDIS: So there's-there's a

15:48.800 --> 15:50.667
comfort level being around trans

15:50.667 --> 15:52.267
women that I've found.

15:52.267 --> 15:53.267
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

15:53.267 --> 15:54.533
>> CANDIS: So what do you do to

15:54.533 --> 15:57.567
combat that feeling of not

15:57.567 --> 15:59.267
wanting to go home?

15:59.267 --> 16:00.567
>> CAITLYN: Uh, to be honest

16:00.567 --> 16:04.167
with you, uh, I, uh, at this

16:04.167 --> 16:06.433
point, uh, I, honestly, I really

16:06.433 --> 16:07.433
don't know.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.967
Um, you know, I've got five

16:09.967 --> 16:13.533
weeks until the ESPYs, which

16:13.533 --> 16:14.967
will be my first public

16:14.967 --> 16:16.467
appearance.

16:16.467 --> 16:17.467
Scared to death of that, 'cause

16:17.467 --> 16:18.467
I'm doing it right in front of

16:18.467 --> 16:19.467
my peers.

16:19.467 --> 16:20.467
>> CANDIS: Yeah, that's a lot of

16:20.467 --> 16:20.967
pressure.

16:20.967 --> 16:21.967
>> CHANDI: That is a lot.

16:21.967 --> 16:22.533
>> CAITLYN: Super Bowl

16:22.533 --> 16:23.533
champions, the... all the guys

16:23.533 --> 16:24.533
who won...

16:24.533 --> 16:25.067
>> CHANDI: All the

16:25.067 --> 16:26.267
hypermasculine men.

16:26.267 --> 16:27.267
>> CAITLYN: Oh, boy.

16:27.267 --> 16:28.267
>> CANDIS: What are you most

16:28.267 --> 16:31.867
nervous about that night?

16:31.867 --> 16:33.133
>> CAITLYN: Exposing yourself to

16:33.133 --> 16:34.533
the world.

16:34.533 --> 16:36.500
Doing it live.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.467
Five weeks, that's the day.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.333
(shuddering breath)

16:51.467 --> 16:53.400
It's gonna be tough.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.067
(voice breaking): My family...

16:55.067 --> 16:57.867
(sighs deeply, sniffles)

17:01.633 --> 17:02.700
Not being... having my whole

17:02.700 --> 17:04.467
family there.

17:04.467 --> 17:06.433
That's the tough part.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.267
I want 'em to be proud of their

17:10.267 --> 17:12.267
daddy.

17:12.267 --> 17:14.233
(sniffles)

17:20.067 --> 17:22.933
>> CHANDI: And they are.

17:22.933 --> 17:24.600
They truly are.

17:24.600 --> 17:27.367
>> CAITLYN: Uh, well, yeah.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.433
So, anyway...

17:29.433 --> 17:30.467
It'll be a marginal...

17:30.467 --> 17:31.467
I hope I can hold myself

17:31.467 --> 17:32.467
together-- I can't even hold

17:32.467 --> 17:33.467
myself together thinking about

17:33.467 --> 17:34.467
it.

17:34.467 --> 17:35.467
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

17:35.467 --> 17:38.533
>> CAITLYN: But... I'll do it.

17:38.533 --> 17:39.200
>> CANDIS: You have the girls'

17:39.200 --> 17:40.200
support.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
>> CHANDI: Yes, you do.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.200
So give old Caitlyn a big old

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200
hug.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
>> CAITLYN: I appreciate it.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.200
>> CHANDI: Cait is on a journey

17:47.200 --> 17:50.200
that is amazing, but, unlike

17:50.200 --> 17:52.867
her, we... our... we didn't do

17:52.867 --> 17:54.200
our journey underneath the

17:54.200 --> 17:56.533
lights and cameras, you know?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.533
So she has a whole nother can of

17:58.533 --> 18:01.267
worms that she's investing in by

18:01.267 --> 18:03.233
going through this process.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.500
>> CANDIS: Well, all right.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.833
>> CHANDI: Word!

18:11.833 --> 18:15.167
>> CANDIS: That is a sheer suit.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.500
I love it.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
>> JEN: How's the water feel?

18:18.500 --> 18:20.167
>> CHANDI: It feels great.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.167
>> JENNY: Is that... is that

18:21.167 --> 18:22.167
a one-piece?

18:22.167 --> 18:23.167
>> CAITLYN: Uh, that's a

18:23.167 --> 18:24.167
one-piece, this is a two...

18:24.167 --> 18:25.167
two-piece, right here.

18:25.167 --> 18:26.167
>> JENNY: Okay.

18:26.167 --> 18:27.167
>> CAITLYN: All right, we'll lay

18:27.167 --> 18:28.500
'em out on the bed.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
That one rocks.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.500
This is a one-piece.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.833
I love my daughter to death...

18:34.833 --> 18:35.833
>> JENNY: (snickers) Okay.

18:35.833 --> 18:36.500
>> CAITLYN: Kimberly.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
>> JENNY: Mm-hmm.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.500
>> CAITLYN: But this is kind of,

18:38.500 --> 18:39.500
uh, one that Kimberly would

18:39.500 --> 18:40.500
wear.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.433
Do you know what I'm saying?

18:41.433 --> 18:42.433
>> JENNY: Uh, not really.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.100
(Jenny laughs)

18:43.100 --> 18:43.767
I'm sorry.

18:43.767 --> 18:44.767
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

18:44.767 --> 18:45.767
Probably a little bit more

18:45.767 --> 18:46.767
revealing in the cleavage

18:46.767 --> 18:47.433
department.

18:47.433 --> 18:48.433
>> JENNY: Oh, I see. Okay.

18:48.433 --> 18:49.433
Well, you've got it to work

18:49.433 --> 18:49.967
with now.

18:49.967 --> 18:50.467
>> CAITLYN: Well, I got

18:50.467 --> 18:51.100
something to work with, yeah.

18:51.100 --> 18:51.767
You know?

18:51.767 --> 18:52.767
>> JENNY: I want to see the

18:52.767 --> 18:53.433
white.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.433
>> CAITLYN: I'm going with white

18:54.433 --> 18:55.100
too-- all right.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.100
>> JENNY: Yeah.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.100
>> CAITLYN: This is the

18:57.100 --> 18:58.100
decision: it's the white,

18:58.100 --> 18:59.100
over-the-one-side-of-the-

18:59.100 --> 19:01.367
shoulder outfit.

19:01.367 --> 19:02.367
>> PRODUCER: Do you have any

19:02.367 --> 19:04.700
anxiety about doing this?

19:04.700 --> 19:06.167
>> RONDA: Oh, let me see this.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.167
Look at her.

19:07.167 --> 19:08.167
What the heck?

19:08.167 --> 19:09.167
>> JENNY: Have you been swimming

19:09.167 --> 19:10.400
in your own bathing suit yet?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.367
>> CAITLYN: No.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.633
>> WOMAN: Oh, my gosh.

19:14.633 --> 19:15.900
>> CAITLYN: I can't go to the

19:15.900 --> 19:17.700
beach or to a pool unless I wear

19:17.700 --> 19:20.100
one of these things anymore.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.833
Putting on that bathing suit

19:21.833 --> 19:23.633
represents a lot to me.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.800
Um, kind of scary because, you

19:25.800 --> 19:27.467
know, you're really exposing

19:27.467 --> 19:28.967
yourself.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.367
Okay, Jen, this is the big one.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.133
I am about as nervous I can

19:33.133 --> 19:36.100
possibly be right now.

19:39.067 --> 19:41.067
*

19:45.967 --> 19:47.067
(indistinct chatter)

19:47.067 --> 19:48.967
>> CANDIS: Bang, bang, bang.

19:48.967 --> 19:51.067
(women whooping)

19:51.067 --> 19:52.867
>> CAITLYN: Okay, are you ready?

19:52.867 --> 19:53.900
>> OTHERS: Yeah!

19:53.900 --> 19:57.233
(chattering, whooping)

19:57.233 --> 19:59.600
>> CAITLYN: We did it! Yay!

19:59.600 --> 20:01.133
>> CANDIS: Ay, ay, ay.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.133
>> CAITLYN: But I'm not getting

20:02.133 --> 20:03.400
my hair and makeup wet, 'cause

20:03.400 --> 20:04.500
we got to do this other thing,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.133
yeah.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.000
Okay, I did it.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.867
I got the bathing suit on.

20:09.867 --> 20:11.100
In the water, it was

20:11.100 --> 20:13.300
nerve-wracking.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.800
It just... yes, it felt very

20:14.800 --> 20:15.867
freeing.

20:15.867 --> 20:18.500
And I did see my reflection in

20:18.500 --> 20:20.700
the... in the glass door.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.133
Looked pretty good.

20:25.133 --> 20:28.800
The ability to grow is directly

20:28.800 --> 20:30.233
related to the amount of

20:30.233 --> 20:31.233
insecurity you can take in your

20:31.233 --> 20:32.233
life.

20:32.233 --> 20:33.233
>> JENNY: (gasps) Ooh.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.233
>> CAITLYN: Do you like that

20:34.233 --> 20:35.233
one?

20:35.233 --> 20:36.233
>> JENNY: That's beautiful.

20:36.233 --> 20:37.233
>> CHANDI: Jen.

20:37.233 --> 20:38.233
>> JEN: I can't touch.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.233
>> JENNY: I'm now gonna do a

20:39.233 --> 20:40.233
magic trick.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.967
Watch my eyelashes disappear.

20:41.967 --> 20:42.967
>> CAITLYN: Disappear.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.233
Oh, there they go. Okay. Whoa!

20:44.233 --> 20:45.900
Okay.

20:45.900 --> 20:46.900
(laughter)

20:46.900 --> 20:48.867
*

20:52.567 --> 20:54.533
>> CAITLYN: Ridden a motorcycle?

20:54.533 --> 20:55.533
>> ZACKARY: I... No.

20:55.533 --> 20:56.533
>> CAITLYN: Don't lie.

20:56.533 --> 20:57.733
Okay, good-- okay, say so.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.433
>> JEN: Never. Never.

20:59.433 --> 21:00.767
>> BLOSSOM: I've ridden one,

21:00.767 --> 21:02.433
once, with someone.

21:02.433 --> 21:03.500
>> CAITLYN: Okay, this is scary.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.500
Okay.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.500
(laughter)

21:05.500 --> 21:06.767
>> ZACKARY: There's this

21:06.767 --> 21:08.600
tendency for-for trans women to

21:08.600 --> 21:11.133
really conform to traditional

21:11.133 --> 21:13.333
ideas of femininity, you know?

21:13.333 --> 21:14.700
Like, as much as possible.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.700
>> CAITLYN: Let's just screw it

21:15.700 --> 21:16.700
up.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.700
>> ZACH: Yeah, I was just gonna

21:17.700 --> 21:18.700
say.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.167
It's so awesome that you're

21:20.167 --> 21:22.667
disrupting that.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.367
>> CAITLYN: This is a off-road

21:24.367 --> 21:28.200
practice place, just for women.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.667
I have ridden motocross bikes

21:29.667 --> 21:31.567
all my life, and I have all the

21:31.567 --> 21:33.067
scars to prove it.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.400
I really thought, with the

21:34.400 --> 21:35.767
girls, I wanted... have... do

21:35.767 --> 21:38.067
something besides roller-skating

21:38.067 --> 21:39.133
to kind of get 'em out of their

21:39.133 --> 21:41.067
comfort zone, try something

21:41.067 --> 21:42.900
very new.

21:42.900 --> 21:43.767
>> SHELINA: Hi, I'm Shelina.

21:43.767 --> 21:44.767
>> CAITLYN: Nice to see you.

21:44.767 --> 21:45.767
>> SHELINA: I run Girlz

21:45.767 --> 21:46.967
Motocamps, and we're here to

21:46.967 --> 21:47.967
teach you guys all how to ride.

21:47.967 --> 21:48.967
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it!

21:48.967 --> 21:50.333
I want to see them on a bike!

21:50.333 --> 21:51.500
(laughter)

21:51.500 --> 21:52.500
I'm gonna be right beside you,

21:52.500 --> 21:53.667
holding your hand.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.900
>> JENNY: We have all this group

21:55.900 --> 21:58.433
of women suited up and ready to

21:58.433 --> 21:59.567
ride, and I think a lot of us

21:59.567 --> 22:00.900
are a little bit afraid of it.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.067
But the whole point of this is

22:02.067 --> 22:03.467
to do something new, to do

22:03.467 --> 22:04.867
something brave, and to do it

22:04.867 --> 22:06.833
out in the open.

22:06.833 --> 22:08.800
*

22:12.467 --> 22:13.667
>> JEN: I paid a lot of money

22:13.667 --> 22:14.667
for this chest, so it needs to

22:14.667 --> 22:15.667
be protected.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.267
(laughs)

22:17.267 --> 22:18.800
>> SHELINA: Let me see.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.800
>> BLOSSOM: I'm about to ride a

22:19.800 --> 22:21.300
dirt bike for the first time

22:21.300 --> 22:22.867
ever in my good Southern country

22:22.867 --> 22:24.267
life.

22:24.267 --> 22:25.667
Yes, it's amazing that I'm here

22:25.667 --> 22:27.767
and that I'm trying new

22:27.767 --> 22:31.400
experiences and everything.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.867
Ooh!

22:32.867 --> 22:33.900
>> CAITLYN: No...

22:37.767 --> 22:38.333
>> SHELINA: You all right?

22:38.333 --> 22:39.300
>> BLOSSOM: Yes, yes.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.300
>> CAITLYN: Okay, that's the

22:40.300 --> 22:41.633
worst that's gonna happen.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.267
If you start going too fast,

22:43.267 --> 22:44.267
just pull that clutch in, and

22:44.267 --> 22:47.333
that'll help slow you down.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.067
>> BLOSSOM: Pull it in.

22:48.067 --> 22:48.500
All right.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.467
>> CAITLYN: And it'll-it'll

22:49.467 --> 22:50.067
stop.

22:50.067 --> 22:50.500
>> BLOSSOM: Gotcha.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.467
>> SHELINA: Want to try again?

22:55.833 --> 22:56.867
(Blossom screams happily)

22:56.867 --> 22:58.667
>> CAITLYN: Way to go!

23:01.067 --> 23:03.167
>> CAITLYN: Oh! Hey!

23:03.167 --> 23:05.567
That's the stuff. There you go.

23:05.567 --> 23:06.567
>> SHELINA: That was awesome!

23:06.567 --> 23:07.567
>> CAITLYN: All right, way to

23:07.567 --> 23:08.567
go!

23:08.567 --> 23:11.300
>> CHANDI: See how you inspire?

23:11.300 --> 23:13.233
I've learned from Cait to hang

23:13.233 --> 23:15.500
in there and you can achieve

23:15.500 --> 23:17.733
what you want when you take that

23:17.733 --> 23:20.500
time to do it.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
>> RONDA: My hand is killing me.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.500
>> COURTNEY: You need to put ice

23:22.500 --> 23:23.500
on that.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.500
You're injured.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
>> RONDA: I kind of had a little

23:25.500 --> 23:26.833
accident last night when we were

23:26.833 --> 23:27.833
roller-skating.

23:27.833 --> 23:28.833
>> CAITLYN: Let's go. You ready?

23:28.833 --> 23:29.833
>> RONDA: Yeah.

23:29.833 --> 23:30.833
>> CAITLYN: Where's all your

23:30.833 --> 23:31.833
stuff?

23:31.833 --> 23:32.833
>> RONDA: Caitlyn.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.067
Ow!

23:34.067 --> 23:35.100
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.233
Look at that hand.

23:36.233 --> 23:37.233
It's looking worse.

23:37.233 --> 23:38.167
Grab my finger.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.067
See? You can ride.

23:39.067 --> 23:39.600
That's all you need to do.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.433
>> COURTNEY: Don't pull it.

23:40.433 --> 23:41.233
>> RONDA: Really?

23:41.233 --> 23:42.233
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, that's all you

23:42.233 --> 23:43.633
need to do.

23:43.633 --> 23:45.600
*

23:50.700 --> 23:52.067
(engine starts)

23:52.067 --> 23:54.067
>> CAITLYN: All right!

23:54.067 --> 23:56.067
>> CANDIS: I'm riding!

23:57.900 --> 24:00.567
>> CAITLYN: That's it.

24:00.567 --> 24:04.500
>> CANDIS: It was so fun.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.933
Oh.

24:05.933 --> 24:07.400
I've always wanted to do that.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
>> CAITLYN: Look it, her hair's

24:08.400 --> 24:09.600
still perfect.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.333
That's not fair.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.367
>> SHELINA: Thank you all for

24:12.367 --> 24:13.633
coming to Girlz Motocamps.

24:13.633 --> 24:14.800
(all whooping)

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
I'm really proud of all of you

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
guys.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.800
>> CAITLYN: This group has been

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
through a lot in their lives,

24:18.800 --> 24:20.133
and to see everybody out there

24:20.133 --> 24:21.600
with a smile, having some fun,

24:21.600 --> 24:23.800
um, and overcoming another

24:23.800 --> 24:26.067
obstacle, uh, has been really

24:26.067 --> 24:27.067
great, and you guys did good.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.067
I was really proud of you.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.067
It's an experience we'll always

24:29.067 --> 24:30.067
remember together.

24:30.067 --> 24:31.633
And last but not least, we're

24:31.633 --> 24:32.967
all very jealous of your hair.

24:32.967 --> 24:34.233
(laughter)

24:34.233 --> 24:35.733
Yeah. Yeah, look at that.

24:35.733 --> 24:36.867
Look at that head of hair she's

24:36.867 --> 24:38.133
got.

24:38.133 --> 24:40.100
Oh, my God!

24:40.100 --> 24:42.067
*

24:49.333 --> 24:50.333
>> JENNY: Because I'm a

24:50.333 --> 24:51.333
gentleman, I'll hold your chair

24:51.333 --> 24:53.333
for you.

24:53.333 --> 24:54.633
>> ZACKARY: To Caitlyn for

24:54.633 --> 24:55.667
having us.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.067
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

24:57.067 --> 24:58.667
And to everybody here for

24:58.667 --> 25:02.133
helping out on this cause.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.467
>> CANDIS: I want to hear what

25:03.467 --> 25:05.733
it is like to date as a trans

25:05.733 --> 25:08.067
woman in our community.

25:08.067 --> 25:10.600
>> WOMAN: Caitlyn, you start.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.800
(laughter)

25:13.800 --> 25:15.667
>> CAITLYN: Absolutely nothing.

25:15.667 --> 25:17.100
(laughter)

25:17.100 --> 25:18.933
>> CHANDI: I know for a fact

25:18.933 --> 25:19.933
you've said many times that

25:19.933 --> 25:20.933
you've only been attracted to

25:20.933 --> 25:21.933
women.

25:21.933 --> 25:22.933
You've never been...

25:22.933 --> 25:23.933
>> CAITLYN: I've only been with

25:23.933 --> 25:24.933
women.

25:24.933 --> 25:25.933
>> CHANDI: And only been

25:25.933 --> 25:26.933
attracted to them.

25:26.933 --> 25:28.533
>> CAITLYN: I got bigger things

25:28.533 --> 25:30.433
than an orgasm to worry about.

25:30.433 --> 25:31.533
>> CHANDI: Bigger things to

25:31.533 --> 25:32.233
figure out.

25:32.233 --> 25:32.800
>> CAITLYN: Bigger things to

25:32.800 --> 25:33.667
worry about than orgasms.

25:33.667 --> 25:34.667
>> WOMAN: Who's more attracted

25:34.667 --> 25:35.667
to men?

25:35.667 --> 25:38.967
Raise your hand.

25:38.967 --> 25:40.067
>> JENNY: Is that a hand?

25:40.067 --> 25:41.067
>> CAITLYN: I-I don't know.

25:41.067 --> 25:42.067
I don't know.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.067
>> WOMAN: She doesn't know.

25:43.067 --> 25:44.067
>> CAITLYN: I've never been with

25:44.067 --> 25:45.067
a guy.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.200
Are you gonna date women?

25:46.200 --> 25:47.200
You gonna date men?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.233
What are you gonna do?

25:48.233 --> 25:50.533
I don't know.

25:53.967 --> 25:54.633
>> CAITLYN: The whole dance

25:54.633 --> 25:55.633
between a male and a female...

25:55.633 --> 25:56.333
>> WOMAN: Yeah.

25:56.333 --> 25:57.333
>> CAITLYN: ...um, you would

25:57.333 --> 25:58.667
feel so much more feminine if

25:58.667 --> 25:59.667
you were with a guy.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.267
>> WOMAN: Wait, what?

26:01.267 --> 26:02.333
>> CAITLYN: No.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.333
>> WOMAN: Wait, what?

26:03.333 --> 26:04.333
>> RONDA: Just physically.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.333
>> CAITLYN: You would feel more

26:05.333 --> 26:06.800
feminine, like you say, if

26:06.800 --> 26:08.267
you're with a guy who treats you

26:08.267 --> 26:09.633
that way.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.367
I can appreciate the male form,

26:11.367 --> 26:13.800
okay?

26:13.800 --> 26:15.133
Um...

26:15.133 --> 26:16.133
>> JENNY: I love to hear you say

26:16.133 --> 26:17.133
that.

26:17.133 --> 26:18.133
I've never heard you say that

26:18.133 --> 26:19.133
before.

26:19.133 --> 26:20.133
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Or you could

26:20.133 --> 26:21.600
look at... yeah, you can

26:21.600 --> 26:22.733
appreciate that.

26:23.067 --> 26:26.067
Um, it-it doesn't mean that I

26:26.067 --> 26:28.067
would go that... I-I don't know,

26:28.067 --> 26:30.067
unless I-I got there.

26:30.067 --> 26:31.067
>> CHANDI: Right.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.267
>> CAITLYN: And for me, if that

26:33.267 --> 26:37.200
was the case... as far as a

26:37.200 --> 26:39.700
male/female relationship, I

26:39.700 --> 26:41.067
would want to have the right

26:41.067 --> 26:42.067
parts.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.067
>> WOMAN: The parts you feel

26:43.067 --> 26:44.067
comfortable with?

26:44.067 --> 26:45.067
>> CAITLYN: What's that?

26:45.067 --> 26:46.067
>> WOMAN: The parts you'd feel

26:46.067 --> 26:47.067
comfortable with?

26:47.067 --> 26:48.067
>> CAITLYN: Uh, yes, and he

26:48.067 --> 26:49.500
feels comfortable with.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.200
But I-I don't count anything out

26:51.200 --> 26:52.700
in the fu... I don't know where

26:52.700 --> 26:54.700
it's all going.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.200
>> CHANDI: Cait is going to

26:56.200 --> 26:57.633
figure out who she wants to

26:57.633 --> 26:59.100
date.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.467
She says that she's never had an

27:00.467 --> 27:01.800
interest in men before, but

27:01.800 --> 27:05.100
she's hot, so what are you gonna

27:05.100 --> 27:06.767
do when men begin to approach

27:06.767 --> 27:08.267
you?

27:08.267 --> 27:09.633
>> JENNY: I think I'm the only

27:09.633 --> 27:11.167
woman here who was and is

27:11.167 --> 27:13.600
exclusively attracted to women

27:13.600 --> 27:15.800
before and after and I'm not

27:15.800 --> 27:18.067
less of a woman or less feminine

27:18.067 --> 27:19.600
because I'm attracted to women.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.767
>> CAITLYN: Absolutely, I agree.

27:20.767 --> 27:22.067
But that-that, absolutely, I

27:22.067 --> 27:23.267
agree, because that's the way

27:23.267 --> 27:24.967
you feel.

27:24.967 --> 27:26.400
>> CHANDI: And it's so good that

27:26.400 --> 27:28.267
people are now having to realize

27:28.267 --> 27:31.267
that gender is more than just

27:31.267 --> 27:32.433
male and female.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.067
>> WOMAN: Yes.

27:34.067 --> 27:35.100
>> CHANDI: I want someone who is

27:35.100 --> 27:36.500
a great all-around person,

27:36.500 --> 27:38.533
regardless of whether you're

27:38.533 --> 27:40.067
masculine or feminine.

27:40.067 --> 27:41.600
I just want you to be cool.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.967
I want you to be somebody who I

27:42.967 --> 27:44.600
can chill with.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.200
Um, if you like Beyoncé, that's

27:46.200 --> 27:47.533
a bonus, you know?

27:47.533 --> 27:49.500
(laughter)

27:58.700 --> 28:00.967
>> JENNY: Ronda.

28:00.967 --> 28:01.967
I just didn't, I didn't know

28:01.967 --> 28:02.967
your history.

28:02.967 --> 28:03.967
I didn't know that you were, you

28:03.967 --> 28:04.967
were friends.

28:04.967 --> 28:06.600
>> RONDA: We're best friends.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.067
Like, we would go to m-movies

28:08.067 --> 28:09.233
twice a week.

28:09.233 --> 28:10.567
We would have dinner.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.133
She'd come to my house.

28:12.133 --> 28:13.400
And I miss my friendship with

28:13.400 --> 28:15.167
her.

28:15.167 --> 28:17.400
And I feel like everyone else is

28:17.400 --> 28:18.667
kind of trumping me.

28:18.667 --> 28:19.967
>> JENNY: I mean, right now she

28:19.967 --> 28:21.067
is a woman walking in sunshine.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.067
>> RONDA: Oh, exactly.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.067
>> JENNY: You know, for the

28:23.067 --> 28:24.067
first time.

28:24.067 --> 28:25.067
>> RONDA: Yeah.

28:25.067 --> 28:26.067
>> JENNY: She's not gonna forget

28:26.067 --> 28:27.067
who her friends are.

28:27.067 --> 28:28.633
The place she's at right now is

28:28.633 --> 28:29.633
not the place she's gonna stay.

28:29.633 --> 28:30.633
>> RONDA: Okay... oh!

28:30.633 --> 28:31.633
>> JENNY: You know, and...

28:31.633 --> 28:32.633
>> RONDA: Well, I don't know.

28:32.633 --> 28:33.667
'Cause I feel like she's so

28:33.667 --> 28:34.833
happy and she's so, like, high

28:34.833 --> 28:35.833
and, like, I want her to be

28:35.833 --> 28:36.833
happy like that.

28:36.833 --> 28:37.833
>> JENNY: Well, yeah, she'll,

28:37.833 --> 28:38.833
she'll, she'll stay high

28:38.833 --> 28:39.833
and happy.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.067
My best friend from-from high

28:41.067 --> 28:42.500
school, he was caught off-guard

28:42.500 --> 28:43.567
by my transition.

28:43.567 --> 28:44.567
He didn't, he didn't quite get

28:44.567 --> 28:45.567
it.

28:45.567 --> 28:46.567
I mean, he said he loved me.

28:46.567 --> 28:47.567
He said he-he'd follow me, but

28:47.567 --> 28:48.600
he had no idea what I was

28:48.600 --> 28:49.767
talking about.

28:49.767 --> 28:50.767
There are times when you're

28:50.767 --> 28:51.767
close, there are times when

28:51.767 --> 28:52.967
you're less close, but you know,

28:52.967 --> 28:54.200
friendship-friendship is a long

28:54.200 --> 28:55.800
game.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.867
>> RONDA: No, exactly.

28:56.867 --> 28:58.233
>> JENNY: And, but none of that

28:58.233 --> 28:59.700
means it doesn't hurt right now,

28:59.700 --> 29:01.633
and, so, the best thing you can

29:01.633 --> 29:02.767
do is take care of yourself.

29:02.767 --> 29:03.767
Have you talked to her about

29:03.767 --> 29:05.167
this?

29:05.167 --> 29:06.500
>> RONDA: I want to, but I

29:06.500 --> 29:07.833
can't do it now.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.467
I don't want her to know.

29:09.467 --> 29:10.267
(voice breaking): I don't want

29:10.267 --> 29:10.900
her to know.

29:10.900 --> 29:11.900
>> JENNY: What don't you want

29:11.900 --> 29:13.300
her to know?

29:13.300 --> 29:15.700
>> RONDA: I miss, I miss what

29:15.700 --> 29:18.100
we had before.

29:19.800 --> 29:20.800
>> JENNY: You ever had a friend

29:20.800 --> 29:22.100
who-who got married?

29:22.100 --> 29:23.900
>> RONDA: No... Yes! Yes.

29:23.900 --> 29:24.900
>> JENNY: Who's, and-and like,

29:24.900 --> 29:25.900
and like, the, like, the...

29:25.900 --> 29:26.900
between the engagement and the

29:26.900 --> 29:27.900
wedding...

29:27.900 --> 29:28.900
>> RONDA: Yes, yes.

29:28.900 --> 29:29.600
>> JENNY: ...they were, like,

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
and they were your best friend

29:30.600 --> 29:31.300
and suddenly they were, like,

29:31.300 --> 29:32.300
monsters?

29:32.300 --> 29:32.967
>> RONDA: Mm-hmm.

29:32.967 --> 29:33.967
>> JENNY: Like the

29:33.967 --> 29:34.633
Bridezilla thing?

29:34.633 --> 29:35.633
>> RONDA: Well, yes...

29:35.633 --> 29:36.633
>> JENNY: There is such a thing

29:36.633 --> 29:37.633
as Transzilla.

29:37.633 --> 29:38.900
>> RONDA: (laughing): Is that

29:38.900 --> 29:40.067
what it's called?

29:40.067 --> 29:41.067
>> JENNY: I, well, I would, I

29:41.067 --> 29:42.067
would never say that because...

29:42.067 --> 29:43.067
>> RONDA: See, you're making me

29:43.067 --> 29:44.067
feel better, because it's like

29:44.067 --> 29:46.367
now I feel like I'm not crazy.

29:46.367 --> 29:48.133
Thank you.

29:48.133 --> 29:49.400
>> JENNY: Okay.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.333
>> RONDA: Thank you.

29:51.333 --> 29:53.833
I really thank you, Jenny.

29:53.833 --> 29:54.833
>> CAITLYN: Blossom, I want to

29:54.833 --> 29:55.833
say thank you for everything.

29:55.833 --> 29:56.500
Thank you for coming.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.167
>> BLOSSOM: Oh...

29:57.167 --> 29:57.967
>> CAITLYN: You're a really

29:57.967 --> 29:58.633
a great person.

29:58.633 --> 29:59.633
>> BLOSSOM: Thank you.

29:59.633 --> 30:00.300
So are you.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.300
>> CAITLYN: Go back home and I

30:01.300 --> 30:02.300
wish you nothing but the best.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.300
Blossom just wants to make this

30:03.300 --> 30:04.300
world a better place.

30:04.300 --> 30:05.833
And with help from friends, you

30:05.833 --> 30:08.300
can kind of conquer the world.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.333
You can go out into the world

30:09.333 --> 30:10.733
and be accepted and be

30:10.733 --> 30:12.300
understood and be a productive

30:12.300 --> 30:14.133
citizen.

30:14.133 --> 30:15.667
>> JENNY: Oh, my God,

30:15.667 --> 30:16.667
that-that's perfect.

30:16.667 --> 30:17.867
That's (bleep) perfect.

30:17.867 --> 30:19.067
>> BLOSSOM: Yeah, I was getting

30:19.067 --> 30:20.067
tired of holding it just a

30:20.067 --> 30:21.067
little bit.

30:21.067 --> 30:22.333
>> JENNY: Bye, Blossom.

30:22.333 --> 30:23.400
I'll see you soon.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.367
>> BLOSSOM: I love you.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.167
>> CAITLYN: Candis?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.167
>> CANDIS: Yeah?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.167
>> CAITLYN: I have a fashion

30:37.167 --> 30:38.167
question.

30:38.167 --> 30:39.167
You're wearing that outfit.

30:39.167 --> 30:40.167
>> CANDIS: Right.

30:40.167 --> 30:41.167
>> CAITLYN: With a bra that you

30:41.167 --> 30:42.167
see the straps.

30:42.167 --> 30:43.233
>> CANDIS: Right.

30:43.233 --> 30:44.600
>> CAITLYN: Now I always wonder

30:44.600 --> 30:46.567
is that, oh, is that, like,

30:46.567 --> 30:47.567
permissible?

30:47.567 --> 30:48.567
>> CANDIS: In a casual setting

30:48.567 --> 30:49.567
it is.

30:49.567 --> 30:50.567
>> CAITLYN: In a casual

30:50.567 --> 30:51.567
setting it is?

30:51.567 --> 30:52.233
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

30:52.233 --> 30:52.900
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

30:52.900 --> 30:53.900
>> CAITLYN: A little wine

30:53.900 --> 30:54.567
tasting.

30:54.567 --> 30:55.133
>> SHARON: Great to meet you

30:55.133 --> 30:56.067
all!

30:56.067 --> 30:56.933
Welcome!

30:56.933 --> 30:58.533
We like to start off our

30:58.533 --> 31:00.100
celebration with a saber, so if

31:00.100 --> 31:02.567
anyone is up for sabering the

31:02.567 --> 31:04.433
first bottle that we open.

31:04.433 --> 31:06.567
>> CAITLYN: Okay, all right.

31:06.567 --> 31:09.267
One, two...

31:09.267 --> 31:11.900
Whoa! First try.

31:11.900 --> 31:12.967
>> CANDIS: First try.

31:12.967 --> 31:13.967
>> SHARON: That came off

31:13.967 --> 31:14.967
beautifully.

31:14.967 --> 31:15.967
>> CAITLYN: Just like I knew

31:15.967 --> 31:16.967
what I was doing.

31:16.967 --> 31:17.967
>> SHARON: It was perfect, yes.

31:17.967 --> 31:19.467
(laughter)

31:19.467 --> 31:21.067
So, cheers to your celebration.

31:21.067 --> 31:22.933
>> CANDIS: I was always told you

31:22.933 --> 31:24.233
were supposed to look people in

31:24.233 --> 31:25.300
the eye when you cheers them.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.567
>> ZACKARY: Yes, ma'am.

31:26.567 --> 31:27.567
>> CAITLYN: To a great four days

31:27.567 --> 31:28.667
together.

31:28.667 --> 31:29.900
>> WOMEN: Yes.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.100
>> JENNY: Outside of your own

31:31.100 --> 31:33.600
family, what woman has had the

31:33.600 --> 31:35.100
greatest influence on you?

31:35.100 --> 31:36.100
>> CAITLYN: That's a great

31:36.100 --> 31:37.600
question.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.733
>> ZACKARY: Flawless Sabrina

31:38.733 --> 31:40.067
started running drag contests in

31:40.067 --> 31:41.867
1959.

31:41.867 --> 31:42.900
>> CAITLYN: You're not old

31:42.900 --> 31:43.967
enough to even know anybody that

31:43.967 --> 31:45.200
was in the '60s.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.200
>> ZACKARY: Well, I love elder

31:46.200 --> 31:47.833
folks and I always have, so...

31:47.833 --> 31:48.833
>> CAITLYN: Well, that's good,

31:48.833 --> 31:49.900
yeah, that's good, okay.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.533
(laughter)

31:51.533 --> 31:52.933
>> CHANDI: Um, Caitlyn Jenner.

31:52.933 --> 31:54.767
>> CAITLYN: Ooh!

31:54.767 --> 31:56.600
Baby, baby, baby!

31:56.600 --> 31:57.833
>> JENNY: I'll drink to that.

31:57.833 --> 31:58.833
>> CAITLYN: Chandi, I appreciate

31:58.833 --> 32:00.067
that.

32:00.067 --> 32:01.200
>> CANDIS: Miss Loudon, who ran

32:01.200 --> 32:02.967
the drama department in-in the

32:02.967 --> 32:05.367
high school, Baldwin High, um,

32:05.367 --> 32:08.800
she... she was always there, you

32:08.800 --> 32:09.800
know?

32:09.800 --> 32:11.200
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.333
>> CANDIS: I don't want to get

32:12.333 --> 32:13.733
emotional, that's stupid.

32:13.733 --> 32:15.267
>> CAITLYN: No, you know, it's

32:15.267 --> 32:16.733
important, the people that had

32:16.733 --> 32:18.900
such a big impact on your life.

32:18.900 --> 32:20.433
>> CANDIS: She was, she-she

32:20.433 --> 32:21.733
helped all the kids that

32:21.733 --> 32:23.500
couldn't fit in... have a place

32:23.500 --> 32:25.067
to fit in.

32:25.067 --> 32:26.067
(quietly): So...

32:26.067 --> 32:27.267
>> CAITLYN: Well...

32:27.267 --> 32:28.333
>> CANDIS: And I was one of

32:28.333 --> 32:29.500
them.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.633
>> CAITLYN: ...that is a great,

32:30.633 --> 32:32.733
yeah, that's a great legacy.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.833
Outside of family, you guys have

32:34.833 --> 32:36.467
probably had the biggest impact

32:36.467 --> 32:37.900
on me ever, you know?

32:37.900 --> 32:39.467
And listening to your stories

32:39.467 --> 32:40.533
and what you're doing and

32:40.533 --> 32:41.600
feeling comfortable about

32:41.600 --> 32:42.633
yourself and...

32:42.633 --> 32:44.133
Out of women in my life, I

32:44.133 --> 32:45.433
probably learned more in the

32:45.433 --> 32:47.200
last month about me and about

32:47.200 --> 32:49.633
life... uh, than ever before in

32:49.633 --> 32:51.967
my entire life.

32:51.967 --> 32:53.933
Okay.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.367
I got to say something.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.633
(sighs)

33:06.067 --> 33:07.067
>> CAITLYN (voice breaking):

33:07.067 --> 33:09.800
Months... months and months ago,

33:09.800 --> 33:12.733
I... (sniffling quietly)

33:14.533 --> 33:16.533
Damn it.

33:16.533 --> 33:19.467
I thought about doing this show.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.333
And I thought how could I do a

33:25.333 --> 33:28.333
show that's gonna make a

33:28.333 --> 33:31.100
difference... in the world?

33:32.667 --> 33:34.833
And I had all these ideas.

33:34.833 --> 33:37.600
All these things.

33:37.600 --> 33:41.233
And I'm struggling with it.

33:41.233 --> 33:42.900
And I'm thinking about my family

33:42.900 --> 33:44.267
and I'm thinking about all this

33:44.267 --> 33:45.433
kind of stuff and I struggled

33:45.433 --> 33:47.467
with all this stuff.

33:47.467 --> 33:49.833
And seeing the things that you

33:49.833 --> 33:51.567
have gone through in your life

33:51.567 --> 33:54.433
and being so honest with this,

33:54.433 --> 33:57.733
and I so apprec... appreciate

33:57.733 --> 34:00.733
all your, your input.

34:00.733 --> 34:02.300
This has been great.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.333
You know, it just really has

34:04.333 --> 34:05.867
been great and the damn wine got

34:05.867 --> 34:06.867
to me!

34:06.867 --> 34:08.367
(laughter)

34:08.367 --> 34:09.667
I don't know if it was the pinot

34:09.667 --> 34:11.400
or whatever, but I so appreciate

34:11.400 --> 34:12.967
your honesty.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.600
>> JENNY: Everybody on Jenner.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.100
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah, oh, no.

34:16.100 --> 34:17.133
You don't have to do that.

34:17.133 --> 34:18.133
>> JENNY: Yep.

34:18.133 --> 34:19.167
>> CAITLYN: No, no, no.

34:19.167 --> 34:20.900
But, um, I so appreciate your

34:20.900 --> 34:22.267
honesty and all that kind of

34:22.267 --> 34:23.700
stuff.

34:23.700 --> 34:25.533
Um, it's just been great.

34:25.533 --> 34:27.133
What has really impressed me is,

34:27.133 --> 34:29.100
at this point in their life, how

34:29.100 --> 34:32.500
normal these girls are.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.333
And I just see great examples of

34:34.333 --> 34:37.067
people who have overcome

34:37.067 --> 34:38.267
tremendous obstacles in their

34:38.267 --> 34:39.667
life.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.067
And it turned out on the other

34:41.067 --> 34:42.367
end, coming out the other side,

34:42.367 --> 34:43.867
a better person.

34:43.867 --> 34:45.067
I know, Candis, you're gonna

34:45.067 --> 34:47.067
need some Visine.

34:47.067 --> 34:48.367
You're turning into me.

34:48.367 --> 34:50.567
Emotional absolute wreck.

34:50.567 --> 34:52.200
Wow.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.367
>> CHANDI: And that's okay.

34:53.367 --> 34:54.733
>> ZACKARY: It's okay.

34:54.733 --> 34:56.500
>> CANDIS: Caitlyn, she has a

34:56.500 --> 34:57.700
story that you should hear.

34:57.700 --> 34:58.800
>> CAITLYN: I want to hear.

34:58.800 --> 34:59.900
>> SHARON: Well, your

34:59.900 --> 35:02.833
transformation has helped me to

35:02.833 --> 35:04.967
understand my father in a way

35:04.967 --> 35:06.833
that I never did before.

35:06.833 --> 35:08.300
>> CAITLYN: Really!

35:08.300 --> 35:09.733
>> SHARON: He used to dress up

35:09.733 --> 35:10.933
and go to San Francisco in the

35:10.933 --> 35:11.967
'70s.

35:11.967 --> 35:13.833
He just came to us and told us

35:13.833 --> 35:15.500
the truth, that he couldn't live

35:15.500 --> 35:16.500
the lie anymore.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.567
And he needed to move on and be

35:19.567 --> 35:21.133
who he was.

35:21.133 --> 35:23.067
That one point that you made,

35:23.067 --> 35:24.567
about being on your deathbed and

35:24.567 --> 35:26.167
not living your life...

35:26.167 --> 35:27.800
>> CAITLYN: It's so true.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.800
>> SHARON: It... I knew, you

35:29.800 --> 35:31.067
know, at that moment I knew,

35:31.067 --> 35:32.067
when he came to us and had to

35:32.067 --> 35:33.367
tell us the truth and how hard

35:33.367 --> 35:34.600
that was for all of us.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.400
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.567
>> SHARON: But it still... was

35:36.567 --> 35:37.867
him being free.

35:37.867 --> 35:38.867
>> CAITLYN: So wonderful to hear

35:38.867 --> 35:39.800
that story.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.167
It makes my heart feel so good.

35:41.167 --> 35:41.867
>> SHARON: It's beautiful.

35:41.867 --> 35:42.533
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

35:42.533 --> 35:43.067
I appreciate that.

35:43.067 --> 35:43.733
>> SHARON: It's absolutely

35:43.733 --> 35:44.300
beautiful. Thank you.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.300
>> CAITLYN: Thank... (sniffles)

35:45.300 --> 35:46.533
(bleep) damn it!

35:46.533 --> 35:47.933
This is so good!

35:47.933 --> 35:49.300
I love this stuff!

35:49.300 --> 35:50.833
(laughter)

35:50.833 --> 35:52.800
(birds chirping)

35:55.367 --> 35:56.833
(crickets chirping)

35:56.833 --> 35:58.333
>> CAITLYN: This is our last

35:58.333 --> 35:59.533
dinner together.

35:59.533 --> 36:00.467
>> WOMAN: Cheers, everybody.

36:00.467 --> 36:01.667
>> JENNY: Love, love.

36:01.667 --> 36:02.733
>> WOMAN 2: Love, love, love.

36:02.733 --> 36:03.533
>> JENNY: Lovey, love, love.

36:03.533 --> 36:04.800
Love.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.933
>> CHANDI: Candis talking about

36:05.933 --> 36:07.700
high school put me in the frame

36:07.700 --> 36:08.967
of mind of where I was starting

36:08.967 --> 36:11.667
to try to remember those

36:11.667 --> 36:13.233
teachers and those experiences

36:13.233 --> 36:15.167
that I had.

36:15.167 --> 36:16.333
How was high school for you

36:16.333 --> 36:17.333
ladies?

36:17.333 --> 36:18.200
>> JENNY: More light dinner

36:18.200 --> 36:19.067
conversation?

36:19.067 --> 36:20.133
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

36:20.133 --> 36:21.067
>> WOMAN: Oh, God.

36:21.067 --> 36:21.967
>> JENNY: My experience of high

36:21.967 --> 36:23.600
school was a lot of bullying, a

36:23.600 --> 36:25.500
lot of being beaten up and

36:25.500 --> 36:29.467
teased for being, um, trans.

36:29.467 --> 36:30.733
Which was weird, 'cause I was

36:30.733 --> 36:32.433
trying not to be feminine, but

36:32.433 --> 36:34.067
people just saw it in me.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.100
They just, they-they could see

36:35.100 --> 36:36.100
it in me no matter how much I

36:36.100 --> 36:37.067
tried to hide it.

36:37.067 --> 36:38.100
>> ZACKARY: You know, I never

36:38.100 --> 36:39.233
had the option to hide.

36:39.233 --> 36:40.533
I mean, I was bullied a lot.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.500
I got, like, death threats in

36:43.500 --> 36:44.633
my locker, I was...

36:44.633 --> 36:46.067
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

36:46.067 --> 36:47.067
>> ZACKARY: ...never was able to

36:47.067 --> 36:48.867
go into the boys' locker room.

36:48.867 --> 36:51.067
>> WOMAN: For fear...

36:51.067 --> 36:51.967
>> ZACKARY: For gym class.

36:51.967 --> 36:52.833
>> WOMAN: ...for fear of being

36:52.833 --> 36:53.567
beat up.

36:53.567 --> 36:54.567
>> ZACKARY: So I would change in

36:54.567 --> 36:57.400
sort of, like, a-a remote

36:57.400 --> 36:58.800
bathroom that nobody used, you

36:58.800 --> 36:59.467
know?

36:59.467 --> 37:00.467
And then I would run across the

37:00.467 --> 37:02.200
school to go to gym class, every

37:02.200 --> 37:03.067
other day.

37:03.067 --> 37:04.067
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

37:04.067 --> 37:06.333
Have you all had fun coming here

37:06.333 --> 37:08.067
and discussing this?

37:08.067 --> 37:08.833
>> JENNY: Yes!

37:08.833 --> 37:09.600
>> ZACKARY: Oh, my God, I'm so

37:09.600 --> 37:10.267
thirsty for it.

37:10.267 --> 37:11.133
>> JEN: We're actually all

37:11.133 --> 37:12.300
learning, just in having these

37:12.300 --> 37:13.067
conversations.

37:13.067 --> 37:13.700
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.333
I mean, I haven't bawled like

37:15.333 --> 37:17.500
that, just talking about a

37:17.500 --> 37:19.567
teacher, in years.

37:19.567 --> 37:20.700
Like, I hadn't even thought

37:20.700 --> 37:21.400
about that.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
(laughter)

37:22.400 --> 37:23.233
>> CAITLYN: So all we have now

37:23.233 --> 37:24.400
is happy stories.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.567
If I hear... if you get me

37:25.567 --> 37:27.567
crying one more time...

37:27.567 --> 37:28.567
(laughter)

37:28.567 --> 37:29.333
...you're going to lose your

37:29.333 --> 37:31.067
dessert privileges.

37:31.067 --> 37:32.633
(laughter)

37:32.633 --> 37:36.067
*

37:36.067 --> 37:37.733
(knocking at door)

37:37.733 --> 37:38.733
>> JENNY: Cait, I hate to bother

37:38.733 --> 37:39.400
you...

37:39.400 --> 37:40.067
>> CAITLYN: Jenny!

37:40.067 --> 37:40.833
>> JENNY: I know you're...

37:40.833 --> 37:41.867
I know it's been a long day.

37:41.867 --> 37:42.767
>> CAITLYN: Look at my good

37:42.767 --> 37:43.767
boots.

37:43.767 --> 37:44.633
>> JENNY: Oh, those are awesome.

37:44.633 --> 37:45.467
I...

37:45.467 --> 37:46.433
>> CAITLYN: From motocross.

37:46.433 --> 37:47.100
>> JENNY: Oh!

37:47.100 --> 37:47.900
>> CAITLYN: Lookit, they're all

37:47.900 --> 37:49.300
dusty.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.800
I gotta take care of my stuff.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.067
>> JENNY: Right now, you're in

37:52.067 --> 37:53.067
this thing that we call "the

37:53.067 --> 37:54.767
pink cloud."

37:54.767 --> 37:55.800
(chuckles)

37:55.800 --> 37:58.100
Which is... which is this place

37:58.100 --> 38:00.867
of euphoria and happiness.

38:00.867 --> 38:01.867
Which is...

38:01.867 --> 38:02.567
>> CAITLYN: I-I do feel pretty

38:02.567 --> 38:03.233
good.

38:03.233 --> 38:03.967
>> JENNY: Which is good, right?

38:03.967 --> 38:04.767
>> CAITLYN: I wouldn't quite go

38:04.767 --> 38:05.567
with a "pink cloud," but yeah,

38:05.567 --> 38:06.500
I-I would go with...

38:06.500 --> 38:07.300
Yeah, I feel, I feel good.

38:07.300 --> 38:08.100
Right.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.333
>> JENNY: And-and that's, that's

38:09.333 --> 38:10.067
good.

38:10.067 --> 38:10.667
>> CAITLYN: It is good.

38:10.667 --> 38:12.167
>> JENNY: But it also means that

38:12.167 --> 38:14.767
you can be a little blind to...

38:14.767 --> 38:17.900
things other than yourself.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.567
The conversation that I had with

38:19.567 --> 38:21.133
Ronda last night made me feel a

38:21.133 --> 38:22.233
little funny.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.900
I-I'm, I'm just afraid that

38:23.900 --> 38:24.933
you're kind of in the midst of

38:24.933 --> 38:26.267
this whirlwind and you're

38:26.267 --> 38:28.067
forgetting some of the...

38:28.067 --> 38:29.067
>> CAITLYN: Um...

38:29.067 --> 38:29.733
>> JENNY: ...some of the people

38:29.733 --> 38:32.200
that you love.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.967
You've got to find a way of

38:34.967 --> 38:37.500
getting... as soon as you can,

38:37.500 --> 38:40.533
outside of yourself.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.833
(birds singing)

38:45.833 --> 38:46.833
>> CAITLYN: Did everybody have a

38:46.833 --> 38:47.667
good time?

38:47.667 --> 38:48.700
>> ZACKARY: Yes, ma'am.

38:48.700 --> 38:49.533
>> CANDIS: It was so much fun.

38:49.533 --> 38:50.267
I can't wait to do it again

38:50.267 --> 38:50.933
soon.

38:50.933 --> 38:51.867
(laughter)

38:51.867 --> 38:52.767
>> CAITLYN: Let's go climb Mount

38:52.767 --> 38:53.433
Everest!

38:53.433 --> 38:54.100
(laughter)

38:54.100 --> 38:54.867
>> CANDIS: I don't know about

38:54.867 --> 38:55.533
that one.

38:55.533 --> 38:56.333
>> JENNY: Don't forget the

38:56.333 --> 38:56.833
skydiving.

38:56.833 --> 38:57.500
>> CAITLYN: We could be the

38:57.500 --> 38:58.400
first trans girls to the top of

38:58.400 --> 38:59.100
Mount Everest!

38:59.100 --> 39:00.767
I mean, we could do something.

39:00.767 --> 39:02.100
We gotta break ground, here.

39:02.100 --> 39:03.067
>> CANDIS: I'll be at base camp

39:03.067 --> 39:04.167
and I'll just, like, cheer you

39:04.167 --> 39:05.067
on.

39:05.067 --> 39:06.500
>> CAITLYN: You'll be fine...

39:06.500 --> 39:07.400
>> ZACKARY: If you feel cooped

39:07.400 --> 39:08.767
up at home, I would love to come

39:08.767 --> 39:09.900
over and visit your house.

39:09.900 --> 39:10.833
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. You got it.

39:10.833 --> 39:11.867
Yeah, yeah.

39:11.867 --> 39:12.567
>> ZACKARY: Watch a movie.

39:12.567 --> 39:13.433
>> CAITLYN: All right, baby.

39:13.433 --> 39:15.067
>> CHANDI: Mmm...

39:15.067 --> 39:16.067
>> CAITLYN: We are out of here.

39:16.067 --> 39:16.933
Good luck.

39:16.933 --> 39:19.167
>> JENNY: Cait has come so far.

39:19.167 --> 39:20.300
Here's a woman who's lived

39:20.300 --> 39:23.067
largely, for 65 years, in her

39:23.067 --> 39:24.400
head.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.867
And suddenly, she's with this

39:26.867 --> 39:29.400
whole team of-of women, having

39:29.400 --> 39:31.433
fun and learning about the

39:31.433 --> 39:32.233
community.

39:32.233 --> 39:33.933
I cannot wait to see what she

39:33.933 --> 39:34.867
does next.

39:34.867 --> 39:35.867
It's gonna be awesome.

39:35.867 --> 39:36.533
>> CAITLYN: Candis and I are

39:36.533 --> 39:37.500
leaving together.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.700
(all laughing)

39:38.700 --> 39:40.400
But we'll see you back in L.A.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.067
>> CANDIS: Love you, girls.

39:41.067 --> 39:41.733
>> ZACKARY: Bye.

39:41.733 --> 39:42.733
>> CHANDI: Bye, baby.

39:42.733 --> 39:44.567
Candis and Caitlyn in the tree,

39:44.567 --> 39:46.467
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.200
>> CANDIS: Seeing Caitlyn

39:48.200 --> 39:49.767
discovering this, like, this new

39:49.767 --> 39:52.367
world has been kind of amazing,

39:52.367 --> 39:54.233
because no matter what

39:54.233 --> 39:56.833
situation you're in, no matter

39:56.833 --> 39:58.667
how far along you are in one

39:58.667 --> 40:01.800
life, you have the power to

40:01.800 --> 40:04.167
change it yourself, with

40:04.167 --> 40:05.500
strength and courage.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.167
>> CAITLYN: Back to reality.

40:07.167 --> 40:07.900
At some point, you gotta go

40:07.900 --> 40:08.600
back.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.467
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

40:09.467 --> 40:10.167
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

40:10.167 --> 40:10.900
>> CANDIS: Face the music.

40:10.900 --> 40:11.700
>> CAITLYN: I know.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.233
But it certainly was nice.

40:13.233 --> 40:14.433
I really love these girls.

40:14.433 --> 40:16.367
We're gonna be friends forever.

40:16.367 --> 40:18.800
And I learned so much from them.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.767
I have realized my voice is,

40:20.767 --> 40:22.133
like, the last thing to worry

40:22.133 --> 40:23.367
about.

40:23.367 --> 40:24.433
It's about the words that come

40:24.433 --> 40:25.500
out, the importance of those

40:25.500 --> 40:26.700
words.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.500
Not about the pitch.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.967
Through this whole trip,

40:29.967 --> 40:31.467
I learned a lot about life and

40:31.467 --> 40:32.833
that, to me, is the most

40:32.833 --> 40:33.867
important thing, 'cause I want

40:33.867 --> 40:36.733
to keep learning and take it day

40:36.733 --> 40:37.833
by day.

40:37.833 --> 40:38.967
>> CANDIS: So we're home.

40:38.967 --> 40:39.867
You ready for this?

40:39.867 --> 40:41.267
>> CAITLYN: No. I know.

40:41.267 --> 40:42.267
Am I ready for these things?

40:42.267 --> 40:43.367
>> CANDIS: You're gonna be good.

40:43.367 --> 40:44.367
You're gonna be good.

40:44.367 --> 40:45.200
>> CAITLYN: It is... it's just

40:45.200 --> 40:46.533
back to the "real world."

40:46.533 --> 40:49.867
>> CANDIS: Yeah, the real world.

40:49.867 --> 40:53.000
>> SINGER: * If there's a God...

40:53.000 --> 40:55.267
Surely He wants me to be

40:55.267 --> 40:57.400
* Myself

40:57.400 --> 41:01.167
If there's a God

41:01.167 --> 41:06.200
If there's a God... *

41:06.200 --> 41:07.600
>> CAITLYN: Want a pickle?

41:07.600 --> 41:08.433
>> RONDA: I'll have a French

41:08.433 --> 41:09.733
fry.

41:09.733 --> 41:10.833
>> CAITLYN: God, that pickle's

41:10.833 --> 41:11.833
sour.

41:11.833 --> 41:13.800
(Ronda laughs)

41:13.800 --> 41:16.967
Um... so what is the deal with

41:16.967 --> 41:18.733
you and Jenny talking?

41:18.733 --> 41:20.300
Honestly, what's going on?

41:20.300 --> 41:22.367
>> RONDA: I feel like...

41:22.367 --> 41:25.067
everything's changed, and it...

41:25.067 --> 41:25.967
>> CAITLYN: Everything's what?

41:25.967 --> 41:26.633
>> RONDA: Well, obviously,

41:26.633 --> 41:27.500
everything's changed.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.200
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.500
>> RONDA: But for me, the

41:29.500 --> 41:30.500
most...

41:30.500 --> 41:32.600
I-I... I've been working for you

41:32.600 --> 41:33.967
for two years, and...

41:33.967 --> 41:34.867
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

41:34.867 --> 41:35.800
>> RONDA: ...we've been friends

41:35.800 --> 41:38.100
for that amount of time-- well,

41:38.100 --> 41:38.800
me and Caitlyn.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.467
>> CAITLYN: And, yeah-- and

41:39.467 --> 41:40.133
before that.

41:40.133 --> 41:41.067
>> RONDA: And longer.

41:41.067 --> 41:42.300
And.. but everything's, like...

41:42.300 --> 41:43.433
Now it's like this, like,

41:43.433 --> 41:46.167
rollercoaster and I feel like I

41:46.167 --> 41:48.767
don't even exist anymore, other

41:48.767 --> 41:50.100
than, like, "Uh, where's my

41:50.100 --> 41:51.767
Starbucks?"

41:51.767 --> 41:52.933
>> CAITLYN: We have been,

41:52.933 --> 41:54.500
obviously, very busy.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.467
>> RONDA: Yeah, I know.

41:55.467 --> 41:56.700
>> CAITLYN: Um...

41:56.700 --> 41:58.433
Sometimes, when I get like this,

41:58.433 --> 41:59.733
you know, I-I kind of go a

41:59.733 --> 42:02.267
little crazy, okay?

42:02.267 --> 42:04.467
And I think I miss out on the

42:04.467 --> 42:05.833
important things in life.

42:05.833 --> 42:06.833
The important things in life are

42:06.833 --> 42:08.267
friendship.

42:08.267 --> 42:10.133
And I've always, you know, for

42:10.133 --> 42:11.333
the last two years, so

42:11.333 --> 42:12.500
appreciated your friendship.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.833
You were there for surgeries,

42:13.833 --> 42:14.933
you're there, you're driving me,

42:14.933 --> 42:16.133
all that kind of stuff.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.333
And if I seem a little cold,

42:18.333 --> 42:21.700
insensitive, I apologize.

42:21.700 --> 42:22.900
>> RONDA: Do you realize we used

42:22.900 --> 42:23.833
to go to the movies all the

42:23.833 --> 42:25.800
time?

42:25.800 --> 42:26.600
>> CAITLYN: Let's go to a movie

42:26.600 --> 42:28.700
right now.

42:28.700 --> 42:30.067
>> RONDA: Really?

42:30.067 --> 42:30.933
>> CAITLYN: Damn it, let's go to

42:30.933 --> 42:31.600
a movie.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.300
>> RONDA: Okay, let's go.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.700
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Come on.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.433
Come on. Let's go.

42:35.433 --> 42:36.233
>> RONDA: Okay.

42:36.233 --> 42:37.067
>> CAITLYN: Get your... get your

42:37.067 --> 42:37.833
little thing, so we can get the

42:37.833 --> 42:39.067
tickets on the way.

42:39.067 --> 42:39.867
>> RONDA: All right.

42:39.867 --> 42:41.200
>> CAITLYN: See, you can't...

42:41.200 --> 42:41.867
>> RONDA: Okay, I love you.

42:41.867 --> 42:42.567
>> CAITLYN: You just love me.

42:42.567 --> 42:43.233
I know, I know.

42:43.233 --> 42:44.067
>> RONDA: No, you're supposed to

42:44.067 --> 42:44.700
love me, too.

42:44.700 --> 42:45.233
>> CAITLYN: I know.

42:45.233 --> 42:45.767
I do love you.

42:45.767 --> 42:46.533
>> RONDA: No, actually, you're

42:46.533 --> 42:47.233
supposed to say, "I love you."

42:47.233 --> 42:47.967
>> CAITLYN: Okay? I do.

42:47.967 --> 42:49.433
Man, this is one sour pickle.

42:49.433 --> 42:50.100
That's all I can say.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.067
(Ronda laughs)

42:58.900 --> 42:59.900
>> CANDIS (laughing): You made

42:59.900 --> 43:00.733
it up the stairs.

43:00.733 --> 43:01.433
>> CAITLYN: Candis and I have

43:01.433 --> 43:02.100
been spending a lot of time

43:02.100 --> 43:02.767
together.

43:02.767 --> 43:03.467
>> CANDIS: You need the strap.

43:03.467 --> 43:04.133
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my.

43:04.133 --> 43:05.233
>> CANDIS: Be right back.

43:05.233 --> 43:06.500
>> WOMAN: We are freaks to a lot

43:06.500 --> 43:07.767
of the world.

43:07.767 --> 43:08.933
>> CAITLYN: We're really trying

43:08.933 --> 43:10.200
to normalize this.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.133
>> WOMAN: The reason you want to

43:11.133 --> 43:12.500
is 'cause you don't want to be a

43:12.500 --> 43:13.500
freak.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.067
>> KIM: I read the Vanity Fair.

43:15.067 --> 43:16.200
You look amazing, but you don't

43:16.200 --> 43:17.433
have to bash us.

43:17.433 --> 43:19.167
>> CAITLYN: Don't go there.

43:19.167 --> 43:20.467
We really haven't had a chance

43:20.467 --> 43:21.833
to talk after you sent me those

43:21.833 --> 43:23.133
tough texts.

43:23.133 --> 43:23.867
>> COURTNEY: When you try to

43:23.867 --> 43:24.667
tell me that I don't know what

43:24.667 --> 43:25.433
I'm talking about because I...

43:25.433 --> 43:26.300
>> CAITLYN: Because you don't

43:26.300 --> 43:27.967
know.
