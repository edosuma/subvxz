every way.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.810
But now I'm into this guy.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.688
- Oh, the heart.
It's so unpredictable.

10:47.772 --> 10:51.192
- I, for one, am fully
on team Trella.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.652
- I can see that.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.490
Troy is like a diamond
in the rough.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.450
Really rough.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.495
More rough than diamond.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.413
- Like a rock you
might find in the yard.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.499
- Hello! Hi.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.417
I'm standing right here.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.669
And I have plenty
of good qualities.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.838
Tell 'em, Snookums.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.717
- Oh, there'll be plenty
of time for that later...

11:16.801 --> 11:19.553
Pooh-pants.

11:19.637 --> 11:23.641
- Oh, they have nicknames.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.768
- Yes, we do.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.729
Some of which may
be temporary.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.774
- Great idea. Why don't
we talk about them now?

11:31.857 --> 11:34.068
Can you guys give
us a little private time?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.570
- Of course, we can.
Let's go.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.407
This is all so weird.
- And exciting.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.618
- Mostly weird.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.703
- Pshooo! Pshooo!

11:47.706 --> 11:49.041
- We're dating?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.876
You couldn't come up with
something better than that?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.586
- What else was
I supposed to do?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.004
Let them find out
I'm taking ballet?

11:54.088 --> 11:57.258
Look, you heard the locker room
laugh when you brought it up.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.342
Those are my friends.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.178
I'll never be able to show
my face in school again.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.097
- But I like Kyle.

12:03.180 --> 12:07.309
And I kinda think maybe
he might like me back.

12:07.393 --> 12:12.982
- You wanna risk my reputation
on kinda-maybe-might?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.817
Come on, you promised.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.278
Wide receiver. QB.
Sacred bond.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.696
- All right, fine,

12:18.779 --> 12:21.657
but you are so gonna
owe me for this.

12:21.740 --> 12:25.661
- Me? This whole ballet
thing was your idea.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.746
So, I mean, if there's
blame to be placed,

12:27.830 --> 12:30.624
I believe we both know
where it belongs.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.462
- Yes, we do.
- Ah! Hey!

12:34.545 --> 12:36.297
- How could this happen?

12:36.380 --> 12:38.299
I'm the one who's supposed
to have a boyfriend first.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.384
I already set my reminder in
my calendar for next year.

12:40.468 --> 12:44.138
His name will be "Henry."

12:44.221 --> 12:45.806
- Forget your girly problems.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.517
Our wide receiver
is dating our quarterback.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.603
What if they have a fight
in the middle of the game--

12:50.686 --> 12:53.355
or worse, they start kissin'?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.983
That's gotta be at least
a 15 yard penalty.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.359
- Do you think I'm
happy about this?

12:57.443 --> 13:01.030
I mean, Kyle I understood,
but what does she see in Troy?

13:01.113 --> 13:04.825
- Are you kidding? He's
a handsome, natural-born leader.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.743
Just like Fernando.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.621
- Oh, come on, no one's
like Fernando.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.997
- PEPPER: [gasping]

13:10.080 --> 13:11.874
- I mean...who's Fernando?

13:11.957 --> 13:16.212
I don't know him or
Rosa Gomez Tavarez de la Vega.

13:16.295 --> 13:21.675
- Wait a minute! You've been
watching "Baja Beach."

13:21.759 --> 13:23.511
- Uh, h-he started it.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.179
- Please don't tell anyone.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.390
- That depends. Are you
on team Fernando or team Juan?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.018
- Fernando. Duh.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.645
- Juan is just so...

13:32.728 --> 13:34.980
Oh, I can't even...
- No.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.400
- ALL: [chattering]

13:38.484 --> 13:41.987
- [classical piano music]

13:46.742 --> 13:48.702
- Look at him.
He is so in the zone.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.956
- Yeah, he must be listening to
some serious thrash metal.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.548
- [whistle shrills]
- Hail up, Bulldogs!

14:00.631 --> 14:02.049
- TEAMMATES: [hooting, cheering]

14:02.132 --> 14:05.344
- All right. Listen up.
Listen up, everyone.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.804
All right, we're on
a winning streak.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.305
But the Bears are tough.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.475
So everybody keep
your head in the game.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.478
And your feet in bounds.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.772
Let's go get 'em, Bulldogs!

14:16.855 --> 14:18.941
- TEAMMATES: [woofing]

14:20.651 --> 14:22.319
- All right, Troy,

14:22.403 --> 14:24.530
just trust what you've been
doing all week in the studio.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.073
You've got this.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.086
- BELLA: Deep fade on two.
Ready?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.921
- BULLDOGS: Break!

14:41.005 --> 14:42.923
- SPECTATORS: [cheering]

14:43.841 --> 14:46.760
- BELLA: Down! Set! Hut!

14:46.844 --> 14:50.472
- [classical music]

15:02.359 --> 15:05.070
[classical music continues]

15:09.783 --> 15:14.038
[classical music continues]

15:15.372 --> 15:19.418
- [whistle shrills]
- SPECTATORS: [cheering]

15:25.382 --> 15:28.969
- I just can't get
over that game, Troy.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.846
I've never seen you
so light on your feet.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.848
And I think I know your secret.
- You do?

15:32.931 --> 15:34.850
- You're dancing--
- Dude, I--

15:34.933 --> 15:35.726
- --on the wings of love.

15:35.809 --> 15:41.982
- Love, yes! Ha. That's it.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.777
- PEPPER: Don't freak out,
but Kyle just walked in.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.695
- Why would she freak out?

15:46.779 --> 15:50.366
She's with the yard rock now.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.577
- Yeah, lucky me.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.871
- Kyle's heading this way.

15:55.954 --> 16:00.376
- Oooh, this should be
"Baja Beach" good.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.253
Or none of our
business. Bye!

16:04.421 --> 16:06.757
- Hey, Bella,
great game tonight.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.467
- Thanks.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.427
- Yeah, you and Troy
were really in sync.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.430
Guess it makes sense.
I hear you're a couple now.

16:13.514 --> 16:17.434
- Oh, right.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.603
- I can't believe my timing.
I was gonna ask you out.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.649
- You were? Uh, I mean...

16:23.732 --> 16:25.567
you were?

16:25.651 --> 16:26.610
- Yeah, but, uh...

16:26.694 --> 16:29.321
guess Troy beat me to it.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.907
Anyway, I'm just glad you found
a guy you really like.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.494
- Well, like is a strong word.
[laughing]

16:35.577 --> 16:37.579
I mean, we are in
a relationship,

16:37.663 --> 16:39.873
but let's just say
the honeymoon's over.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.292
Stay right here.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.961
- Now, the thing is--
- We need to talk!

16:44.044 --> 16:46.171
- Really?

16:46.255 --> 16:49.591
- So, we have to break up.
- What?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.218
No, we can't.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.512
My game is so much better
with...ballet.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.763
And you're my cover.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.390
- I was your cover.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.059
Kyle just told me
he wanted to ask me out.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.894
- Oh, that's so cool.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.396
Y'all should
totally do that--

17:02.479 --> 17:04.231
at--at the end of the season.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.275
- That's almost three months.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.112
- Ooh, you're right.
We might make the playoffs.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.655
Then there's championship

17:11.739 --> 17:14.324
and we'll have to defend our
title at the end of the season.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.951
I'm thinking two years tops.

17:16.034 --> 17:18.662
- I'm not letting
a fake relationship

17:18.746 --> 17:20.247
get in the way
of a real one.

17:20.329 --> 17:23.208
- Trust me--a fake relationship
with The Troy

17:23.291 --> 17:25.502
is way better than a real one
with a kid who wore

17:25.586 --> 17:27.796
a Batman cape for
the entire summer.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.884
- He was seven. People change.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.802
And it was adorable.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.721
- As adorable as this?

17:35.804 --> 17:38.932
- Oh, you leave me no choice.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.768
- Whoa, what are you doing?

17:40.851 --> 17:44.438
- Sorry Troy.
It's over!

17:44.521 --> 17:47.649
- Uh, Bella, please,
give me a chance.

17:47.733 --> 17:51.570
I can change.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.947
- It's not you. It's me.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.617
- Well, then you can change.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.620
We can change together,
Bella, please.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.663
Don't give up on us.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.500
You're my bae.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.962
- Aw, Bella, he's on his knees.
Have a heart.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.214
- Look, I'm begging you.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.800
What you and I are doing
is helping the team.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.844
Look, if you won't do it for me,
do it for the Bulldogs.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.430
Please, Bella, take me back.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.349
- Take him back.
- Take him back.

18:20.432 --> 18:26.563
- [chanting "Take him back!"]

18:26.647 --> 18:29.483
- Okay, fine.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.151
- ALL: [cheering]

18:31.235 --> 18:32.778
- You won't regret this.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.864
Stay right here. I'll get you
your favorite smoothie.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.867
What's your favorite smoothie?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.703
Never mind, I'll surprise you.

18:41.787 --> 18:42.871
Oh, hey, Kyle.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.249
- Hey, man, that was intense.

18:45.332 --> 18:49.253
- Yeah, well, you do what
you gotta do for love.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.214
- Anyway, I'm just
glad she's happy.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.431
- Yeah. Real happy.

19:01.515 --> 19:11.316
- ♪

19:11.400 --> 19:14.027
- Hey, Dixon,
great job last game.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.572
Whatever you're doing
is working.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.408
- The technique is called love.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.327
- Yeah. I really didn't
need to know this.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.916
- BELLA: [sighing]

19:28.000 --> 19:29.376
- TROY: [sighing]

19:29.459 --> 19:31.253
Actually, it's not love.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.673
You see, Bella and I aren't
really dating.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.217
- You're not?
- Troy, what are you doing?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.261
- I just made that up
to cover up the truth,

19:39.344 --> 19:44.683
and the truth is Bella's been
teaching me ballet.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.352
- Wow. Thanks, Troy.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.064
And I don't wanna hear anyone
laughing. Understand?

19:51.148 --> 19:53.066
I don't wanna hear how ballet

19:53.150 --> 19:55.027
makes him look like
less of a man.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.946
I don't want anyone calling him
nicknames like Tutu Troy,

19:58.030 --> 20:01.241
Ballerina Boy.
You hear me?

20:01.325 --> 20:05.913
It's not funny!
- Bella, no one's laughing!

20:05.996 --> 20:07.915
- Right.
[laughing]

20:07.998 --> 20:10.250
Just makin' sure.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.963
- That was a gutsy thing to do.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.759
I'm really proud of you, son.

20:18.842 --> 20:19.968
- And you've given me
the courage to confess

20:20.052 --> 20:23.180
Sawyer and my's darkest secret.
- No, no, no, no, no!

20:23.263 --> 20:25.724
- We watch "Baja Beach"
and we love it.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.644
We're "Baja Beach" dudes.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.979
- Okay, I appreciate
what you're doing, Newt.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.148
But my secret was actually real.

20:33.231 --> 20:36.360
No man would ever ever
watch "Baja Beach."

20:36.443 --> 20:38.654
- Actually--
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.698
Shhhh! We're just trying
to, uh...

20:41.782 --> 20:43.367
We're your bros!

20:43.450 --> 20:45.994
- We're still gonna watch
later this weekend, right?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.913
- Of course. Think I'd miss
the wedding of the century?

20:47.996 --> 20:50.624
- SAWYER &amp; NEWT: [giggling]

20:50.707 --> 20:52.542
- Look, I'm sorry I dragged
you into this.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.669
And don't worry about Kyle.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.837
I'll make sure he knows
this whole dating thing

20:55.921 --> 20:58.298
was just pretend.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.300
- Thanks, Troy.
That's really sweet.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.135
- And, I mean,
he'll understand pretend.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.973
The guy was Batman
for a whole summer.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.015
- Don't you start.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.977
- What? What's
that over Gotham?

21:10.060 --> 21:10.727
It's the Kyle signal!

21:10.811 --> 21:13.814
To the Batcave!

21:13.897 --> 21:17.442
- This is gonna hurt a lot more
than a ballet slipper!

21:19.569 --> 21:21.530
- [piano accompaniment]

21:22.322 --> 21:24.324
- SAWYER: Ow. Okay. Okay.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.119
Where's Bella? I thought
she was gonna teach us.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.620
- Oh, she texted me.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.038
Apparently, she and Sophie
and Pepper are celebrating

21:30.122 --> 21:32.207
her freedom from what she called

21:32.290 --> 21:34.126
the nightmare
relationship with Troy.

21:34.209 --> 21:38.255
- Again, I'm standing
right here.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.048
- Yeah, anyway...

21:40.132 --> 21:42.092
she said we'd have a sub.

21:42.175 --> 21:45.178
- [gasping] You?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.763
- Me!

21:46.847 --> 21:48.223
