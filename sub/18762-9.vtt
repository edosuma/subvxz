00:50.531 --> 00:52.285
What the hell?

00:58.089 --> 00:59.458
Shit.

01:00.350 --> 01:02.384
You're nothing but a street rat!

01:03.779 --> 01:05.597
I may be a street rat,

01:05.631 --> 01:07.767
but I still got your bread, bitch.

01:10.268 --> 01:12.838
Excuse me, excuse me, are you, um...

01:12.872 --> 01:14.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm the suck boy you're looking for.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.842
You want my time,
you got to pay to spray.

01:16.875 --> 01:19.845
That's my motto.
That and you cannot finish inside me.

01:19.878 --> 01:23.215
No, no, no, Matt. It's me.

01:25.217 --> 01:26.786
Dad?

01:26.818 --> 01:29.054
It's time to come home, son.

01:54.017 --> 01:55.652
You want me to come work for you?

01:55.684 --> 01:57.953
Well, I want you to learn the business.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.690
I'm not getting any younger.

01:59.723 --> 02:02.291
It's time for me to pass the torch.

02:02.325 --> 02:04.194
- Oh, shit.
- What?

02:04.226 --> 02:05.361
- You're dying.
- What?

02:05.395 --> 02:06.963
I-I figured. You look like hell.

02:06.995 --> 02:09.465
Hey, has anyone claimed your organs?

02:09.746 --> 02:12.035
I'm not dying, you idiot.

02:12.068 --> 02:13.969
I'm retiring.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.304
Oh. My bad.

02:15.338 --> 02:16.573
I had to ask.

02:16.606 --> 02:18.041
It's a seller's market right now.

02:18.074 --> 02:19.342
Look what you've become.

02:19.374 --> 02:21.143
Do you want to live this way, son?

02:21.177 --> 02:24.047
Covered in manure, selling your body,

02:24.080 --> 02:27.583
smoking PCP or whatever it is you smoke.

02:27.617 --> 02:29.086
Oh, come on.

02:29.118 --> 02:30.886
Do I look like a dusthead to you?

02:30.920 --> 02:32.888
You certainly don't look like my son.

02:32.921 --> 02:35.758
Matthew Mara. You remember him?

02:35.791 --> 02:37.059
Come on.

02:37.093 --> 02:39.929
Give the job a shot, for Christ's sake.

02:40.666 --> 02:41.531
I'll think about it.

02:42.081 --> 02:43.366
I got to pop in here first.

02:43.398 --> 02:47.336
You don't have to go into
a dive bar right now.

02:47.369 --> 02:49.539
I'm just gonna clean myself up.

02:49.571 --> 02:50.773
Have a little faith.

02:50.807 --> 02:52.342
My friends have a very nice setup

02:52.374 --> 02:54.910
for me to take a shower in here.

02:54.944 --> 02:57.914
In fact, I'm the type of gal
who makes men's lives better.

02:57.946 --> 03:01.521
Hey-o! You guys mind if I shower
in that leaky urinal again?

03:03.086 --> 03:04.521
Well, that... don't count that.

03:04.553 --> 03:05.554
That's not a good example.

03:06.723 --> 03:07.923
Ah!

03:10.659 --> 03:13.062
Eh. While I'm here, I might as well...

03:13.095 --> 03:16.099
do a little P to the C to the P.

03:19.402 --> 03:21.804
Take me to the angels, baby.

03:29.678 --> 03:32.214
<i>It's time to come home, son.</i>

03:32.248 --> 03:34.917
Maybe it's time to make a change.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.169
All right, uh, this is the loading dock

03:52.201 --> 03:54.770
where we, uh, ship our supplies from.

03:54.803 --> 03:56.772
And right here...

03:56.806 --> 03:58.141
this is you.

03:58.173 --> 03:59.642
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

03:59.676 --> 04:00.810
This is nice.

04:00.844 --> 04:02.279
I'm gonna sleep well tonight.

04:02.311 --> 04:04.146
No, no. You're not gonna
sleep there. Come on.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.982
Get out. Get out of the damn box.

04:06.015 --> 04:08.185
You're gonna sleep at home in a bed.

04:08.217 --> 04:09.952
- Oh. Eh, too exposed.
- Yeah.

04:09.986 --> 04:12.100
No. I-I'll sleep in, uh,
maybe the crawlspace

04:12.135 --> 04:13.685
- or a cupboard.
- This is bullshit.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.991
Hey, hey, hey, Davy, Davy.

04:15.024 --> 04:17.961
- Calm down, Davy.
- He's a homeless junkie, Dad.

04:17.995 --> 04:19.029
I don't even understand
why we're doing this.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.963
- He's just gonna burn you again.
- All right.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.532
- When did I ever burn Dad?
- You stole his identity.

04:23.565 --> 04:25.000
- Eight times!
- Well, at least

04:25.034 --> 04:27.137
I didn't wet the bed till
I was in high school.

04:27.169 --> 04:28.370
Shut your mouth about that.

04:28.404 --> 04:29.873
- Whatever, Davy Diapers.
- I will kill you.

04:29.906 --> 04:31.441
- Try it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:31.474 --> 04:32.509
Come on! Take it back!

04:32.541 --> 04:33.510
You want another noogie?

04:33.543 --> 04:34.678
All right, all right, boys.

04:34.844 --> 04:35.845
Boys! Stop it!

04:35.878 --> 04:37.947
His scalp came off on my fingers.

04:37.981 --> 04:39.382
Goddamn it.

04:39.414 --> 04:41.051
Now look here, guys.

04:41.084 --> 04:44.120
We have an important meeting coming up.

04:44.613 --> 04:46.289
It's our biggest account.

04:46.322 --> 04:47.557
And I'm gonna tell them

04:47.589 --> 04:50.893
that my boys
are taking over the business.

04:50.926 --> 04:52.395
Both of them.

04:52.428 --> 04:55.498
You guys need to get your shit together.

04:55.531 --> 04:58.168
Got it? Huh?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.835
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. Yes.

04:59.868 --> 05:02.339
All right.

05:03.884 --> 05:05.976
I got my eye on you, loser.

05:06.008 --> 05:07.910
And you stink like piss, by the way.

05:08.525 --> 05:11.047
It's freakin' bullcrap.

05:16.087 --> 05:17.186
What a jerk.

05:18.688 --> 05:20.022
Huh?

05:20.056 --> 05:21.858
Oh. Yeah.

05:21.890 --> 05:23.225
He's always been a hard-on.

05:23.258 --> 05:25.060
He's the one who stinks, by the way.

05:25.094 --> 05:27.664
His shoes smell like rotten eggs.

05:27.697 --> 05:28.865
You smell his shoes?

05:28.897 --> 05:31.066
Yeah. He kicks at me

05:31.099 --> 05:32.701
if he catches me sleeping at work.

05:32.734 --> 05:34.737
Calls me a bitch, that kind of thing.

05:34.770 --> 05:36.872
Yeah. He treats me like shit, too.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.541
Sorry. I didn't get your name.

05:38.573 --> 05:40.075
Oh. I'm Belle.

05:40.108 --> 05:41.710
Thus the necklace my mother gave me

05:41.743 --> 05:43.946
that I'm currently guilt-wearing.

05:44.697 --> 05:45.684
Belle.

05:45.719 --> 05:46.649
That's a nice name.

05:47.582 --> 05:49.419
I'm Cricket, uh, Matthew.

05:49.452 --> 05:50.786
It's nice to meet you, Matthew.

05:53.883 --> 05:54.890
Hey, date!

05:55.893 --> 05:57.459
Um, I'm sorry. What?

05:57.493 --> 05:59.762
Shit. Sorry. Um,

05:59.796 --> 06:02.866
haven't done this in a long time. Uh...

06:02.899 --> 06:04.534
would you like to go on
a date with me some time?

06:04.567 --> 06:07.437
Yeah. Yeah, I... I'd like that.

06:07.469 --> 06:09.138
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

06:10.117 --> 06:12.976
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

06:17.748 --> 06:18.869
Okay.

06:24.729 --> 06:26.460
Hey, boss?

06:26.493 --> 06:28.496
- You go by Cricket?
- I do.

06:28.529 --> 06:29.796
Phone's for you. Line two.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.032
Oh, really?

06:36.202 --> 06:38.705
- Mm. Hello.
- Cricket!

06:38.739 --> 06:41.508
Oh. Cricket.

06:42.212 --> 06:44.145
Damn it! How the hell
did you guys find me?

06:44.178 --> 06:45.678
A magician never
reveals his tricks, Cricks.

06:45.712 --> 06:47.414
Yeah. We did put that
pet-tracking device in him.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.015
Well, wait. Don't tell him that.

06:49.049 --> 06:51.485
Wait. You did what? Wait.
Did you put a chip in...?

06:51.520 --> 06:52.419
Did you put a chip in me?!

06:52.452 --> 06:54.854
Nothing, Cricket. Hey, listen,
um, we got a job for you, buddy.

06:54.888 --> 06:57.258
Oh, do you? Well, uh, I'm not doing it.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.993
- Well, you don't even know what it is.
- Hey! Yeah. Come on, man.

06:59.025 --> 07:00.493
- You don't know what the job is, Cricket.
- You don't know the job.

07:00.527 --> 07:02.596
Doesn't matter. I know
it probably involves hurting me,

07:02.628 --> 07:04.564
degrading me or generally
treating me like shit.

07:04.597 --> 07:06.900
- You're not totally wrong. Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:06.933 --> 07:10.037
- Cricket, uh, we'll give you five bucks, huh?
- Yeah, five dollars, Cricket.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.505
The answer is no.

07:11.537 --> 07:12.907
All right. Fine. Three dollars.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.175
Well, you don't go down in negotiation.

07:14.207 --> 07:15.443
- You go up.
- With Cricket, you do.

07:17.077 --> 07:19.661
Well, now it's $2.50, Crick,
so you want the job or not?

07:19.696 --> 07:21.782
- You know, ticktock.
- Uh, look, guys, um,

07:21.815 --> 07:24.852
I got a new life,
so I don't need anything from you.

07:24.885 --> 07:25.821
- Ugh. Come on. Hey.
- Well, Cricket,

07:25.822 --> 07:28.688
- everybody needs a little extra cash.
- Yeah. It's money, Cricket!

07:28.722 --> 07:31.358
Well, uh, actually, that is true,

07:31.390 --> 07:33.593
because I... I do have a date.

07:33.626 --> 07:36.362
- Oh. Cricket. Cricket.
- Ah. Well, don't make up a story.

07:36.395 --> 07:38.231
I mean, yeah, we don't care what
you're doing with the money.

07:38.265 --> 07:39.967
Hey, dipshit!

07:40.000 --> 07:42.436
We're not paying you
to talk on the phone.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.439
Speaking of, I need some cash.
When do we get paid?

07:45.472 --> 07:47.808
Paychecks come at the end of the month.
Who you talking to, huh?

07:47.840 --> 07:49.309
Your drug dealer?

07:49.342 --> 07:52.146
Your skeezy little arrogant
douche bag friends down at the bar?

07:52.178 --> 07:54.815
- Those guys are my friends!
- Whatever!

07:56.183 --> 07:58.618
I am so onto you.

07:59.028 --> 08:02.455
And I bet you're gonna be
high by the end of the night.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.830
Ooh!

08:09.863 --> 08:11.966
Freakin' bullcrap!

08:11.998 --> 08:13.129
He's getting yelled at.

08:13.129 --> 08:15.436
Well, don't piss off your trick there,
Cricket. He might

08:15.469 --> 08:16.936
- cut you up.
- Yeah, just

08:16.969 --> 08:18.906
finish the guy off,
and then come do the job for us.

08:18.939 --> 08:20.274
- Yeah.
- All right, what's it gonna be?

08:20.306 --> 08:21.808
We need a decision, Cricket.

08:21.841 --> 08:24.444
Mm...

08:24.478 --> 08:26.313
Are we ready to party tonight?

08:28.782 --> 08:30.521
So am I!

08:33.019 --> 08:35.321
- Dad?
- Oh! Janie? Oh!

08:35.354 --> 08:36.756
Let's just have a good
time and get drunk, huh?

08:36.789 --> 08:38.491
Stuff it down with some brown.

08:38.524 --> 08:39.993
Stuff it down with brown.

08:40.027 --> 08:43.188
- Can always stuff it down.
- Hey, good job, fellas.

08:43.616 --> 08:45.115
I loved how you ruined that dad.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.767
Ah. I got to say, it's kind of fun

08:46.800 --> 08:48.835
being on the other end
of it sometimes, huh?

08:49.682 --> 08:51.772
Okay, time to pay the piper.
Who's got the money?

08:51.805 --> 08:52.705
- Yes.
- Oh, uh, Frank.

08:52.739 --> 08:55.041
Lemons.

08:55.075 --> 08:58.012
What? No. N-No, okay? No, you're not
paying me in lemons again.

08:58.045 --> 08:59.847
Okay? Hey, we had an agreement.

08:59.879 --> 09:01.948
You want to get paid in PCP, Cricket?
'Cause you're just

09:01.982 --> 09:03.784
- gonna spend it on drugs anyway, right?
- Oh, yeah, skip the middleman.

09:03.816 --> 09:05.219
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah. You want some dust?

09:05.252 --> 09:07.454
No. Okay, normally, okay?

09:07.487 --> 09:09.823
But now I'm off drugs,
and I actually have a date,

09:09.855 --> 09:12.025
so I need the money,
I really need the money.

09:12.059 --> 09:14.161
Look, Cricket, I'm sure whatever
street mongrel you're dating...

09:14.194 --> 09:16.330
she's into lemons, too, so you're good.

09:16.363 --> 09:18.532
Goddamn it. Goddamn you,
you are the worst person ever.

09:18.565 --> 09:21.468
And by the way,
my name is not Cricket, okay?

09:21.500 --> 09:24.137
My name is Matthew Mara.

09:24.171 --> 09:27.007
I'm a person. A person, by the way,
who has a job now.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.877
Yeah. I am going to be running
a company soon.

09:29.910 --> 09:31.745
- Cricks, I love you, but this is so boring.
- You're losing me.

09:31.777 --> 09:33.546
Goddamn it! All right, you know what?
Screw you guys.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.049
- Hey, Cricket? Cricket? Cricket!
- Come on.

09:35.081 --> 09:37.551
Cricket, Cricket, calm down, man.
Hey, look.

09:37.584 --> 09:39.520
What?

09:39.552 --> 09:41.888
- You want the lemons or not?
- Unbelievable.

09:41.921 --> 09:43.757
- Yes, I'm gonna take the lemons. Goddamn it.
- All right, yeah.

09:43.790 --> 09:44.858
- You guys are the worst.
- He wants the lemons.

09:44.891 --> 09:46.060
- He needs the lemons.
- The guy loves lemons.

09:46.093 --> 09:47.493
He needs the lemons for the scurvy.

09:47.527 --> 09:49.095
- Yeah, yeah.
- He'll be back.

09:53.399 --> 09:54.867
After everything I've done, you know?

09:54.901 --> 09:57.838
After everything they've done to me.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.843
Belle?

10:02.875 --> 10:03.943
What are you doing here?

10:04.453 --> 10:05.745
Promise I'm not stalking you.

10:05.778 --> 10:07.740
I'm just out for a walk.

10:08.305 --> 10:09.987
My dad'll be so worried about me,

10:10.022 --> 10:11.794
but I just had to get out of the house.

10:11.829 --> 10:13.531
- Ah.
- Ever since my mom died,

10:13.532 --> 10:17.558
I'm kind of all he's got,
so he's become a little overbearing.

10:17.589 --> 10:20.193
Yeah, I get that.
I got an overbearing dad, too.

10:20.226 --> 10:23.096
- Yeah.
- My life's the worst.

10:26.465 --> 10:28.368
Um. Ah.

10:30.170 --> 10:32.106
You're so funny.

10:33.288 --> 10:34.240
Okay.

10:34.544 --> 10:37.650
- And cute.
- Oh, son of a bitch.

10:37.651 --> 10:38.551
Did someone put you up to this?

10:38.578 --> 10:40.469
- No. Why?
- Look, I am not funny,

10:40.470 --> 10:42.229
and I'm sure as shit not cute.

10:42.264 --> 10:43.783
Nobody put me up to this, okay?

10:43.816 --> 10:47.086
I like you. I do, and

10:47.119 --> 10:49.623
I feel like we have more
in common than you think.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.260
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

10:53.292 --> 10:55.395
Go behind some Dumpster and bang?

10:56.169 --> 10:57.631
I was kind of talking about that date.

10:57.663 --> 11:00.600
Oh. I'm into that.

11:49.047 --> 11:50.647
There they are!

11:51.411 --> 11:52.365
Davy, Pops.

11:54.483 --> 11:56.786
I met the most amazing girl.

11:56.819 --> 11:58.525
I'm in love. I'm in love!

11:58.749 --> 12:00.017
And I owe it all to you, Dad,

12:00.050 --> 12:01.252
for giving me a second chance.

12:01.284 --> 12:03.086
Thank you. Now,

12:03.119 --> 12:05.523
let's go in this meeting
and show this guy

12:05.556 --> 12:07.090
that he is making the right choice

12:07.124 --> 12:09.760
investing in the Mara brothers!

12:09.793 --> 12:11.428
You missed it, asshole.

12:12.612 --> 12:13.697
Huh?

12:13.730 --> 12:16.331
You missed it. The meeting.
We lost the account.

12:16.366 --> 12:17.795
Dad, I told you we couldn't trust him.

12:17.830 --> 12:21.439
Goddamn it, Matt. This was your chance.

12:21.471 --> 12:24.374
Shit. Okay. Um, I'll talk to the guy.

12:24.781 --> 12:26.911
I will make this right, okay?

12:26.944 --> 12:28.746
He's probably down by his car right now.

12:28.778 --> 12:31.381
Carl Lewis couldn't catch him!

12:33.601 --> 12:35.653
I can.

12:49.633 --> 12:50.802
Mr. Sanderson!

12:51.350 --> 12:52.236
Mr. Sanderson!

12:54.994 --> 12:55.788
Matthew Mara.

12:55.839 --> 12:57.641
Did you just do a flip off that truck?

12:57.675 --> 12:58.976
Yes, sir. That is how dedicated I am

12:59.008 --> 13:00.244
to keeping your business. Now, look,

13:00.277 --> 13:01.646
I know you have your reservations,

13:01.678 --> 13:03.979
but I'm asking you...
give us a second chance.

13:04.013 --> 13:06.517
I'm not giving you a second chance.
I made my decision. It's final.

13:07.158 --> 13:10.188
Okay. Well, guess I'm gonna
have to cut your heart out then.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.023
What did you just say?

13:12.056 --> 13:14.624
I said I guess I'm gonna have to cut...

13:14.657 --> 13:17.360
your heart... out of your body.

13:17.393 --> 13:18.763
You see, uh,

13:18.796 --> 13:20.364
I'm from the streets.

13:20.397 --> 13:22.499
And I'm about to poke you full of holes.

13:23.901 --> 13:25.002
He'll do it!

13:25.034 --> 13:27.637
What? Well, th-that's great!

13:27.671 --> 13:29.640
What changed your mind, Tom?

13:29.672 --> 13:31.842
Uh, your son here
made a compelling argument.

13:31.875 --> 13:36.179
What? Oh. Well, see, he's my boy.

13:36.212 --> 13:37.180
We will not let you down,

13:37.214 --> 13:39.016
- Mr. Sanderson.
- Uh, D-Davy,

13:39.048 --> 13:41.651
- don't push. Uh,
- Yes, sir.

13:41.685 --> 13:44.355
Tom, let's discuss this.

13:46.190 --> 13:47.657
Hey.

13:47.691 --> 13:49.460
What?

13:49.493 --> 13:51.362
Maybe I misjudged you.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.630
Maybe you're not...

13:53.663 --> 13:56.466
just some homeless junkie.

13:57.016 --> 13:58.602
Maybe you're my brother.

14:00.571 --> 14:04.542
Sorry I said that about Carl Lewis.

14:13.441 --> 14:15.352
- Belle.
- Heard me comin', I guess.

14:15.385 --> 14:16.723
I think I just saved the company.

14:17.053 --> 14:19.389
Wow. That's great news for you.

14:19.422 --> 14:21.926
And probably bad news for me.

14:23.027 --> 14:24.362
I'm running away.

14:24.728 --> 14:26.029
I got to see the world.

14:26.664 --> 14:29.866
I was wondering if you might
want to come away with me.

14:30.888 --> 14:31.601
I-I can't.

14:31.634 --> 14:34.371
I mean, this is my life now.

14:34.404 --> 14:36.940
Yeah. I understand.

14:36.974 --> 14:39.042
Well, I should go.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.946
Hey, um...

14:41.979 --> 14:44.715
could you just help me with my necklace?

14:44.748 --> 14:46.951
I can never seem to get it off.

14:46.984 --> 14:48.653
Sure.

14:50.613 --> 14:53.556
- Here.
- No, I... I want you to keep it.

14:54.012 --> 14:55.893
Something to remember me by.

14:57.795 --> 15:00.564
Well, good-bye, Matthew.

15:00.596 --> 15:02.600
Well, here's something
to remember me by.

15:12.625 --> 15:16.379
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
what are you doing?!

15:16.412 --> 15:18.581
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making out

15:18.614 --> 15:20.283
- with the woman I love.
- What the hell

15:20.316 --> 15:22.219
are you talking about? That's Dad's dog.

15:22.252 --> 15:25.589
You're making out with my dog!

15:25.622 --> 15:27.258
Dog?

15:27.291 --> 15:28.292
Oh, shit!

15:30.460 --> 15:31.629
Oh, no.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.100
Maybe it's time to make a change.

15:51.281 --> 15:53.284
Nah, I'm gonna smoke it.

15:56.577 --> 15:57.787
- I'm Cricket.
<i>- I'm Belle.</i>

15:57.821 --> 15:59.623
- That's a nice name.
<i>- His shoes</i>

15:59.656 --> 16:01.125
- <i>smell like rotten eggs.</i>
- Lemons.

16:01.157 --> 16:03.860
- Screw you guys!
- <i>You smell his shoes?</i>

16:14.388 --> 16:15.439
Huh.

16:15.471 --> 16:16.506
He's gone.

16:16.539 --> 16:18.675
Way to go, Rickety Cricket.

16:18.709 --> 16:21.479
So, you did exactly
what I thought you'd do,

16:21.512 --> 16:24.614
you goddamn street rat!

16:25.206 --> 16:27.391
Matt, Matt, goddamn it.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.954
I gave you a shot.

16:29.986 --> 16:31.688
You can't go around

16:31.721 --> 16:34.794
doing insane shit like kissing dogs.

16:35.310 --> 16:38.963
You got to put all that nonsense
behind you once and for all.

16:38.995 --> 16:41.898
Now, this is my last
and final offer.

16:41.931 --> 16:45.335
You cut that bullshit out
and come work with me,

16:45.368 --> 16:46.870
or you go back on the street

16:46.903 --> 16:48.838
and crawl back into that manure pile

16:48.872 --> 16:50.408
I found you in.

16:51.380 --> 16:53.143
So, which is it?

16:53.176 --> 16:54.377
Huh?

16:56.712 --> 16:59.182
- Hey-o!
- Oh, Cricket!

16:59.216 --> 17:01.685
- Cricket!
- Hey, hey!

17:01.718 --> 17:04.021
Hey, you guys mind if I go in
the bathroom and smoke some PCP?

17:04.054 --> 17:05.922
- Smoke up, bud.
- Yeah, absolutely, dude.

17:05.955 --> 17:07.391
- Do what you got to do, man.
- You do you, bud. You do you!

17:07.423 --> 17:08.893
We don't judge, Cricket, we don't judge.

17:08.925 --> 17:10.926
- Have fun, buddy.
- Go, Cricket.
