14:25.990 --> 14:26.824
not me.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.369
I've wanted it to be
something more, but...

14:31.412 --> 14:32.329
she didn't.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.710
That sucks. [scoffs]

14:41.422 --> 14:42.506
You know what you need?

14:43.424 --> 14:44.258
This.

14:44.758 --> 14:48.053
Because before you love someone else,
you got to love yourself.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.691
I didn't mean to make things weird.

15:04.778 --> 15:08.574
Turns out,
not all of your advice is useless.

15:09.950 --> 15:10.868
[chuckles]

15:16.123 --> 15:17.833
Excuse me. Can I check your bag?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.002
Oh, hello again.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.045
Yeah.

15:29.011 --> 15:29.929
We cool?

15:30.679 --> 15:35.142
Good, because I'm having
some sensitivity down there.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.268
You know how it is.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.980
What are your thoughts
on this brand of lube?

15:40.773 --> 15:41.982
[laughing]

15:42.066 --> 15:44.944
Slick, Moe. I seriously thought
we were going to be caught for sure.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.487
-Not me.
-[phones chime]

15:46.987 --> 15:47.821
Who--

15:48.781 --> 15:50.783
Oh, Luca, what do you want from us?

15:51.075 --> 15:53.786
"Cool show tonight at PT, 10:00 p.m."

15:54.912 --> 15:55.996
Luca's kinda hot.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.333
What? I can still tell.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.919
Yeah, if you're into the whole dark,
mysterious--

16:02.002 --> 16:03.212
Oh, shit, it's your dad.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.421
Oh, shit.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.430
Oh, fuck.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.599
That's...

16:15.849 --> 16:17.101
not your mom.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.799
Well, you know I love
when I can get you all to myself.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.426
You say that, but...

16:50.926 --> 16:53.387
most of the time,
you have ten guys around.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.348
Well, no one's around right now.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.204
I actually just remembered...

17:19.747 --> 17:20.998
I got something for us.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.250
Oh, yeah?

17:23.333 --> 17:24.376
I just thought...

17:24.960 --> 17:26.503
maybe we could try...

17:27.046 --> 17:27.963
this.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.800
Why? What for?

17:33.343 --> 17:37.473
I talked to friends and they said that
this could make things a bit more fun.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.640
[scoffs]

17:39.850 --> 17:41.685
I'm not sure how you want me to take this.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.188
-Brady, I was just--
-No. Fuck this.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.900
God, why is nothing
ever good enough for you?

17:50.694 --> 17:52.738
So that's it? End of conversation?

17:54.156 --> 17:55.282
Yeah. You should go.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.329
-Brady--
-No, I asked you to leave!

18:53.799 --> 18:56.385
[man on video indistinct]

18:57.761 --> 18:59.638
Well, shit.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.057
That's not great.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.058
[knock at door]

19:03.142 --> 19:04.309
It's unlocked.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.105
[laughs]

19:08.188 --> 19:09.982
I've seen a porn
that starts just like this.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.567
I bet I know how it ends.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.236
I didn't think you would be coming by.

19:14.903 --> 19:15.904
Why?

19:16.488 --> 19:17.656
We had plans.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.575
Remember?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.243
Yeah, I remember.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.079
I also remember seeing you
flirt with your ex.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.790
What? Does sitting next to someone
on the bus count as flirting?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.460
'Cause if so, I may have a lot of people
to apologize to.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.963
Oh, so you're just a bus whore. Got it.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.382
Oh, you caught me. Don't shoot.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.595
This isn't about the bus.
She came for me and you didn't do shit.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.056
I really don't understand you. You want me
to pretend like we're not tight,

19:43.140 --> 19:44.683
but you also want me to have your back?

19:44.766 --> 19:46.685
No, I just didn't take you
for such a lemming.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.478
-What's a lemming?
-Forget it.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.689
Come on.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.065
I'm being serious.

19:53.650 --> 19:54.651
What do you want from me?

19:55.027 --> 19:57.029
Right now, I just want you to leave.

[music playing]

20:26.516 --> 20:28.060
Hi. Um...

20:39.154 --> 20:40.155
Look...

20:40.239 --> 20:42.616
I know the kind of girl
used to getting what you want.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.533
I just...

20:45.244 --> 20:46.870
can't be a part of your high school drama.

20:48.705 --> 20:49.539
I'll see you around.
