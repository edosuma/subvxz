01:02.312 --> 01:03.355
Hello?

01:29.840 --> 01:30.841
Hello?

01:48.775 --> 01:49.776
Hello?

02:35.906 --> 02:38.617
Hello? Hello?

03:43.974 --> 03:47.477
Let's stay with Ariana.
Did she get you the gun?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.562
No, that was me.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.024
-Not Ariana?
-No.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.442
-Does it matter?
-It could. Yeah.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.777
Why?

03:56.612 --> 03:58.363
-Why did I get the gun?
-Yeah.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.158
She needed rescuing.

04:01.241 --> 04:06.246
You needed to rescue her?
Don't you find that at all ironic?

04:06.330 --> 04:07.789
Why would I find that ironic?

04:08.790 --> 04:12.211
People need help sometimes.
You must know that, right?

04:12.294 --> 04:14.254
That's not the way
it turned out though, is it?

04:14.338 --> 04:17.966
She shot two people,
and now you're here all alone.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.850
Hello. Hello!

06:41.485 --> 06:42.569
Danny!

06:46.365 --> 06:48.200
Dan, come on. Let's go. Dan.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.121
He's a loudmouth.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.082
You wanna stay here?

06:55.582 --> 06:58.460
-Open this fucking door.
-You handle it.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.259
Danny. Danny!

07:09.721 --> 07:12.933
What the fuck are you doing in there?
What the hell happened to your face?

07:15.561 --> 07:17.980
-I'm okay, Mom.
-Get the hell out of this house.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.940
You scared your mother half to death,
not coming home.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.275
-Baby, just come home.
-Dan.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.027
-Okay. Let's go. Right now. Come on.
-Danny.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.071
Move, mister.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.447
The boy stay here now.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.951
-The fuck?
-Get off my property.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.786
I don't tell you twice.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.456
What is this bullshit?

07:37.207 --> 07:39.877
-Danny, baby--
-Shut up. Let me handle this.

07:40.377 --> 07:46.008
Don't talk to a woman that way.
You're a bully. All bullies are cowards.

08:01.940 --> 08:02.941
He wants to be here.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.154
Out of our hair.
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Let's go.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.615
Come on. Candy, come on.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.540
-Baby?
-I'm okay.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.044
They're cool. I'm good.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.505
Let's go. Candy, come on.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.800
I promise you that I'll be safe here.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.897
Why did you stay there
after the fight with Bill?

08:43.106 --> 08:44.358
I didn't know what to do.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.445
I couldn't go home.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.240
Why?

08:51.323 --> 08:53.367
I guess my stepfather thought
that I was trouble.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.412
We were on a collision course, him and I.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.333
What happened between the two of you?
What are you not telling me?

09:02.251 --> 09:04.461
It was just time for me to move out.
That's all.

09:05.629 --> 09:06.630
Okay.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.930
Enter Yitzhak.
Right when you needed him most.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.016
Almost as if he'd been waiting for you.
It's some coincidence.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.852
I just figured I was lucky.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.563
Have you ever been lucky?

09:24.648 --> 09:26.066
No. Not really.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.695
Yitzhak had home rules.

09:30.445 --> 09:34.116
You pay the rent on time.
You do school or GED.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.119
No parties in the house.
No sex in the house.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.787
No drugs in the house.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.832
Follow the home rules
and you'll be safe from those bullies.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.211
It's "house."

09:48.463 --> 09:49.464
What'd you say?

09:51.967 --> 09:53.218
We say "house rules."

09:56.096 --> 09:57.389
House rules.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.366
That sounded like a lot of fun.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.579
Yeah, it was a real laugh riot.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.164
He your dad?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.333
Stepdad.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.837
Yeah, I had one of them.
Yitzhak got you those.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.049
That was fast.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.217
I know.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.096
So how come you live here?

10:38.931 --> 10:41.016
You gonna ask a lot of questions,
is that it?

10:43.477 --> 10:46.021
Yeah, I guess. So?

10:47.231 --> 10:48.398
Yeah, I room here.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.609
He helped me out of a jam.
Kinda like he did you.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.196
How come?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.365
'Cause he's the fucking pied piper. Mayo?

10:58.408 --> 11:01.411
-Excuse me?
-Do you want mayonnaise on your BLT?

11:03.372 --> 11:06.166
-Sure.
-You don't have to cry about it.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.338
Eat.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.017
This is amazing.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.352
Obviously.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.399
And that was pretty much
all she told me about herself.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.150
At first, anyway.

11:33.819 --> 11:34.820
What are you writing?

11:34.903 --> 11:37.155
Please go on.
You were telling me about Ariana.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.329
I guess she's what you would call
a night person.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.539
Fuck you!

11:47.749 --> 11:49.918
I'd be waking up,
and she'd be coming home.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.640
Hey, are you okay?

12:04.766 --> 12:06.018
Fuck off, Danny.

12:57.694 --> 13:02.658
Fuck. Fuck you.

13:10.249 --> 13:12.626
She would come home late.
She was drunk a lot.

13:12.709 --> 13:16.046
Sometimes she would hit the wall so hard,
I thought she was gonna break her hand.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.341
But mostly she just cried.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.762
And then the next day,
it was as if nothing had ever happened.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.431
You know, I can't remember a time

13:27.558 --> 13:29.560
where my mom and Marlin
were in the same room

13:29.643 --> 13:30.978
without yelling at each other.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.731
But with me and Ariana, it was different.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.193
I mean, we would hardly say
a word to each other.

13:38.277 --> 13:40.654
We understood one another
without even talking.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.199
Yitzhak, he would come and go.
He would never say where.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.869
So, most of the time,
it was just me and Ari.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.912
How long did you live there?

13:52.583 --> 13:53.584
A couple of years.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.336
Can you be more specific?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.173
Three years all in.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.842
-And what else did you do?
-What do you mean?

14:01.925 --> 14:03.886
Did you have hobbies? Did you go on trips?

14:03.969 --> 14:06.513
Is there anything that you can think of
that was memorable?

14:07.389 --> 14:08.223
No.

14:08.307 --> 14:10.225
What did you do for money?
How'd you pay rent?

14:11.310 --> 14:14.605
-Jonny sold a ton of weed.
-Okay.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.690
I would be what you would call
a passive investor.

14:16.773 --> 14:22.029
So the rent and the utility were paid for
under the name Yitzhak Safdie,

14:22.112 --> 14:23.989
and they were always paid in cash.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.241
Like I said, Yitzhak was secretive.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.327
Did he ask you to do anything for him?

14:30.162 --> 14:31.163
What kind of things?

14:31.246 --> 14:33.457
Errands, maybe.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.377
Is it possible that you did some things
that maybe you don't remember?

14:41.507 --> 14:42.508
What?

14:46.470 --> 14:49.806
Do you remember everything
you've ever done? No.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.434
Look, I was just living my life.
Can't a person just live?

14:52.518 --> 14:53.977
Yeah, course they can.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.398
I think that when I was living
in that house,

14:59.149 --> 15:02.152
it was the only time in my life
that I've ever actually been happy.

15:04.613 --> 15:08.408
I don't understand why your mother
and stepfather would leave you there

15:08.492 --> 15:10.661
all alone for three whole years.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.080
-It was only across the street.
-You were a kid.

15:13.163 --> 15:16.834
-I was 18. They draft kids at 18.
-That's not the point.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.920
Why would they let you go?
You needed a family.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.632
What?

15:24.883 --> 15:26.093
You know,

15:26.718 --> 15:30.931
the longer I was there,
the more they became my family.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.981
Anyone need anything
from the grocery store?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.746
Quisp beats Quake every time.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.752
Nah. Big miner stomps little alien.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.256
Not if the alien
has a little helicopter beanie.

16:05.424 --> 16:07.843
You beat me fair and square.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.137
They're not really adversaries, you know.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.638
How you been, Danny Sullivan?

16:13.724 --> 16:15.726
So, how's college anyway?

16:16.476 --> 16:20.898
Yeah, it's pretty good. I'm back home
for summer, which is instantly weird.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.193
Apparently, during which time
you've been relegated to shopping duty.

16:24.276 --> 16:25.360
Right?

16:25.444 --> 16:27.654
Hey, I'm sorry about what happened
with me and you.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.656
I think I just got scared.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.910
You know,
then that thing happened with Bill.

16:33.827 --> 16:34.995
You know he got suspended?

16:39.791 --> 16:42.169
Did you get kicked out? I never knew.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.758
Well, everyone said you did.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.218
Well then it must be true.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.803
Because no one argues
with everyone, right?

16:52.804 --> 16:53.889
I really am sorry.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.308
I liked that you were different.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.436
I mean, it made me anxious,
but it was exciting.

17:02.898 --> 17:07.236
Well, I got to go.
Farewell, large, ungainly miner.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.156
Farewell, small, propeller-headed alien.
Go in peace.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.075
We should hang out sometime.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.243
Friday.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.289
I'm having some people over
at my place on Friday at eight o'clock,

17:19.373 --> 17:20.374
if you're interested.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.834
You have a place?

17:23.085 --> 17:24.252
I have a place.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.339
Okay. You should give me your address.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.008
Sure.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.429
Thank you. Come back soon.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.186
See you Friday.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.480
See you Friday.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.070
-Yo, Danny. You're a sight for sore eyes.
-What up, Jonny?

17:50.654 --> 17:53.448
So, they got you
delivering groceries now, is that it?

17:54.575 --> 17:56.243
I actually thought
I might have some people over.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.871
To the ghost house?
I thought you said you couldn't do that.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.416
-I might have just invited Annabelle.
-Oh, man.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.377
Only problem is,
I don't really know any people.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.628
Well, you know me and Mike.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.131
-That's kind of my point.
-Asshole.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.800
-Okay, I'll tell some people.
-Could you get me some more weed?

18:11.884 --> 18:15.470
Of course. And that's not all I got.

18:16.555 --> 18:17.890
What does that mean?

18:17.973 --> 18:20.851
Nothing, man. I mean,
you got a house, and I got the party.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.731
-Jonny, who even says that?
-Me, I guess.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.737
The ghost house.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.951
-Man, I want a place like this.
-Of course you want a place like this.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.661
I want a place like this.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.205
You couldn't get the references.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.625
I couldn't get the references?
Where did you get the references?

18:46.001 --> 18:47.461
You know what? I didn't actually need one.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.755
-Yitzhak never asked.
-Yitzhak. Where is Yitzhak, man?

18:49.838 --> 18:51.048
He doesn't want to party with us?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.217
You know, he travels a lot.
I'm not sure where he goes.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.845
And where's the girl? Beautiful Alana.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.056
-Ariana?
-No, Ariana.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.224
She's hot though, right?

19:00.307 --> 19:03.060
-You think that she'd dig me?
-No, I don't think she would dig you.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.229
I think she could pretty much kill you
just by looking at you.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.732
So she's my type.
You could say I like murderous, intense--

19:08.815 --> 19:10.108
No, she would not dig you.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.278
-Oh, shit.
-Speak of the devil.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.696
I thought you said you were going out.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.032
And I thought you knew
there were no drugs in this house.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.785
-Oh, Danny. No drugs?
-Danny, you didn't tell us

19:19.868 --> 19:21.870
there weren't supposed
to be drugs in the house.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.413
We are avid rule followers.

19:23.497 --> 19:25.165
We would never do something--
If we had known…

19:25.249 --> 19:28.502
It was Jonny's idea. This is Jonny
by the way. I'm Mike. Nice to meet you.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.420
-Hi, I'm sorry.
-We're Danny's friends. It was our idea.

19:30.504 --> 19:33.799
-Don't get the kid in trouble, sis.
-Sis? Yeah, I don't think so.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.014
-Amateurs.
-That was Mike.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.140
That was who?

19:42.224 --> 19:43.809
You were supposed to sift out the seeds.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.269
-I swear--
-That was the one you rolled.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.187
That was you. I didn't touch anything.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.314
You--

19:50.065 --> 19:51.066
Did you roll that?

19:51.650 --> 19:54.361
Absolutely. You like that album?

19:54.444 --> 19:56.113
This one? Yeah. No. Yeah.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.906
I mean, the way
they layer the two guitars,

19:57.990 --> 19:59.741
but one is in drop D,
so he can be fingerpicking

19:59.825 --> 20:03.579
and playing that shit so high.
It's wild, right? Do you like it?

20:04.872 --> 20:05.873
No.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.625
That's a little harsh.

20:08.709 --> 20:13.380
You don't have to, like, rip out my heart.
You can let a man down easy. Come on.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.259
Oh, shit. This is a lot better. Try that.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.635
Yeah, no shit.

20:18.719 --> 20:20.345
-Danny?
-Okay, fuck off.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.972
Yeah. All right.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.265
You said it was a party, right?

20:26.977 --> 20:27.978
Yeah.

20:29.021 --> 20:30.189
Okay.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.357
Yeah, come in. Of course. Sure.

20:32.441 --> 20:33.942
Guess I better roll some more joints then.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.195
And beer is in the fridge.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.155
Welcome to the ghost house.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.657
-Enjoy.
-Teach me how you roll these, okay?

22:26.138 --> 22:29.016
I gotta know right now

22:29.099 --> 22:32.519
Before we go any further
Do you love me?

22:32.603 --> 22:35.522
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?

22:35.606 --> 22:36.940
Will you never leave me?

22:37.024 --> 22:39.776
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?

22:39.860 --> 22:42.779
Will you take me away?
Will you make me your wife?

22:42.863 --> 22:45.616
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?

22:45.699 --> 22:48.493
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?

22:48.577 --> 22:51.288
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life?

22:51.371 --> 22:53.999
Will you take me away?
Will you make me your wife?

22:54.082 --> 22:58.128
I gotta know right now
Before we go any further

22:58.212 --> 23:00.631
Do you love me? Will you love--

23:03.383 --> 23:04.801
Should have been the first place I looked.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.888
Meat Loaf? You shame me.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.766
This thing is done.
So put a fork in it. I'm going home.

23:10.849 --> 23:11.850
Are you coming?

23:14.353 --> 23:15.354
No.

23:16.647 --> 23:17.940
Is it cool if I hang out?

23:23.111 --> 23:24.112
Whatever.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.407
Hey, asshole. Wear a fucking rubber.

23:39.253 --> 23:42.089
Sorry. She's a jerk.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.591
Who, Eden?

23:45.717 --> 23:47.386
How could you say such a thing?

23:55.102 --> 23:56.103
Hey.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.022
Hey, are you okay?

23:59.606 --> 24:01.066
-Fine.
-I'm fine.

24:09.324 --> 24:10.325
You're really pretty.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.120
Thanks.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.630
Danny?

24:25.757 --> 24:28.594
Danny, can I--

24:44.735 --> 24:45.736
Is this okay?

24:47.029 --> 24:48.989
Yeah.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.425
Come on.

25:09.843 --> 25:10.844
What?

25:12.346 --> 25:13.347
Nothing.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.042
Hey.

25:44.920 --> 25:45.921
Hey.

25:47.422 --> 25:50.676
Last night was pretty fun.

25:54.012 --> 25:55.013
Yeah, it was fun.

26:09.987 --> 26:12.614
You can kiss me, you know?

26:14.575 --> 26:15.576
I can?

26:17.870 --> 26:18.871
Yeah.

26:20.747 --> 26:21.915
Come here.

26:42.436 --> 26:43.437
You okay?

26:44.354 --> 26:46.064
Yeah. You okay?

26:47.482 --> 26:48.483
Yeah.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.029
I gotta go. Walk me to the door?

26:52.112 --> 26:53.113
Yeah.

27:13.091 --> 27:14.468
You look like shit.

27:15.511 --> 27:16.512
Thanks.

27:26.730 --> 27:30.526
You cool? About last night?

27:35.405 --> 27:36.406
I was high.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.080
You wish I didn't do that?

27:45.165 --> 27:46.875
You two exclusive or something?

27:48.669 --> 27:50.337
No. It was cool.

27:51.213 --> 27:52.381
I swear.

27:53.549 --> 27:55.467
She seemed really comfortable with you.

27:55.551 --> 27:57.970
Yeah,
well maybe you should have kissed her too.

27:59.054 --> 28:01.431
Yeah, that seems to be the consensus.

28:01.515 --> 28:03.016
It was a party.

28:09.982 --> 28:12.234
I'm hungry. You want to get a burger?

28:13.694 --> 28:14.736
Just me and you?

28:27.374 --> 28:29.334
-Yeah? Yep.
-All right, ready?

28:29.418 --> 28:30.419
Let's go.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.296
Oh, shit.

28:45.184 --> 28:46.351
So you like girls, huh?

28:47.811 --> 28:48.979
What gave me away?

28:51.064 --> 28:52.399
Not always.

28:55.402 --> 28:57.321
I heard you
in your room yesterday morning.

28:58.155 --> 28:59.698
I do sometimes. You okay?

29:00.782 --> 29:03.285
What about my face says,
"Let's share our secrets?"

29:08.457 --> 29:10.375
Some shit happened to me is all.

29:10.459 --> 29:11.460
What kinda shit?

29:12.419 --> 29:13.420
Bad shit.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.215
What kind of bad shit?

29:17.007 --> 29:18.008
When I was a kid.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.636
You wouldn't understand.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.055
Try me.

29:28.894 --> 29:30.187
You want to see a movie?

29:31.730 --> 29:33.273
I-- Yeah, I would love to.

29:34.525 --> 29:37.194
All right, let's see what's playing.

29:41.532 --> 29:44.326
They got some Rocky. Alien?

29:45.661 --> 29:48.413
I don't know if I'll like Alien.
It's a little scary.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.291
It's almost as though
she was made-to-order.

29:52.042 --> 29:54.378
Just a perfect best friend for you.

29:56.964 --> 29:57.965
Not quite.

30:00.425 --> 30:01.760
Not quite perfect.

30:06.849 --> 30:07.850
You like it?

30:09.351 --> 30:12.271
Yeah, I loved it. I really liked the part
when they went to the zoo.

30:13.230 --> 30:14.898
That was your favorite part?

30:14.982 --> 30:16.817
-Come on. Just do it already.
-Yeah. I just--

30:16.900 --> 30:18.735
-I always really like the animals.
-Where's she going?

30:18.819 --> 30:21.280
-I've never actually been to a zoo, so…
-Ari!

30:22.072 --> 30:23.490
-Ariana!
-Just walk.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.702
-Is that guy someone you--
-Ariana, I'm talking to you!

30:28.579 --> 30:31.331
Why you wanna ignore me like that?
Let's me and you hang out.

30:34.418 --> 30:36.670
-I know you hear me talking to you.
-Watch it.

30:36.753 --> 30:39.298
You wanna pretend like
you don't know me? You know me.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.258
Just fuck off, will you, Benny?

30:41.341 --> 30:42.843
Puta, why you wanna be like that?

30:43.427 --> 30:47.389
-Ariana.
-Ari, who is that?

30:49.349 --> 30:51.685
-Ari, you know, you can talk--
-Just leave it alone, Danny.

30:52.394 --> 30:55.147
Okay, we're not gonna
be best fucking pals. Are you kidding me?

30:55.898 --> 30:57.941
-Why are you saying--
-Fuck off.

31:01.653 --> 31:05.115
You understand that you're describing
somebody who's profoundly unstable?

31:09.036 --> 31:11.205
What was she doing at night, Danny?

31:12.956 --> 31:13.957
Do you know?

31:15.042 --> 31:16.210
I didn't at the time.

32:25.112 --> 32:26.113
Hey, Ari.

32:28.156 --> 32:29.157
Hey.

32:38.542 --> 32:39.543
Sergio.

33:10.407 --> 33:12.326
-Hey, Carl.
-Hey, Ari.

33:14.620 --> 33:15.954
Seven and seven.

33:16.038 --> 33:17.039
No kidding.

33:21.710 --> 33:22.711
Hi there.

33:23.879 --> 33:25.047
I'm Grace.

33:26.757 --> 33:27.758
Hey, Carl.

33:29.510 --> 33:30.511
Your first time?

33:32.262 --> 33:34.598
-Yeah, I'm from Washington.
-Yeah.

33:35.390 --> 33:36.391
This place is wild.

33:44.525 --> 33:45.567
Maybe later.

33:59.957 --> 34:02.793
The place is cool,
but the drinks are crazy expensive.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.921
Don't worry. I got a tab.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.966
Carl, it's on me.

34:09.967 --> 34:10.967
Thanks.

34:12.219 --> 34:13.219
You want to dance?

34:14.179 --> 34:15.472
Yeah. I'll see you out there.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.306
Can't wait.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.770
There's one born every minute.

34:23.605 --> 34:27.275
Jerome was looking for you last night.
A few nights actually.

34:28.025 --> 34:29.027
Whatever.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.280
Aren't we sure of ourselves?

34:31.947 --> 34:33.282
When you got it, you got it.

34:36.409 --> 34:38.286
Let me buy you a drink on Grace.

36:05.541 --> 36:07.251
Hey, see you later, okay?

36:07.334 --> 36:08.544
What?

36:10.212 --> 36:11.672
I thought we could hang out.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.715
No, I'm cool. Catch you later.

36:26.436 --> 36:28.522
Jerome. What's up?

36:28.605 --> 36:29.606
Hey, Ari.

36:30.274 --> 36:32.234
Want a drink? Turns out I'm buying.

36:32.901 --> 36:33.986
Sure.

36:34.069 --> 36:35.696
Manhattan, please, Carl.

36:35.779 --> 36:36.780
Another round.

36:38.490 --> 36:39.867
So what's new, man?

36:39.950 --> 36:41.243
Fuck you, Ari.

36:41.869 --> 36:44.413
How you just ditch me like that?
It's been four nights.

36:45.372 --> 36:46.665
What am I, your wife now?

36:47.374 --> 36:48.709
Don't play.

36:48.792 --> 36:52.588
That what you want, just tell me and we
can finish with this bullshit real fast.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.340
Is that what you want?

36:55.424 --> 36:57.551
No. And sorry, just--

36:57.634 --> 36:59.303
What, you got another boyfriend?

36:59.386 --> 37:02.556
Someone outside of here?
What, is he older or something?

37:05.517 --> 37:08.353
Look, I got scared, okay?

37:10.022 --> 37:11.899
I'm not good at the whole feeling part.

37:14.735 --> 37:15.944
Yeah.

37:16.486 --> 37:18.530
Everything in here
is like a fucking movie.

37:18.614 --> 37:19.823
Have you ever noticed that?

37:23.368 --> 37:26.413
Relax, I got me a tab.

37:31.919 --> 37:34.922
So, wanna dance or something?

37:36.590 --> 37:37.591
Hell yeah, I do.

38:55.919 --> 38:59.089
Yo, can we meet outside of here?

39:00.382 --> 39:01.842
I don't even know where you live.

39:02.843 --> 39:04.052
Upstate.

39:07.681 --> 39:08.682
You okay, baby?

39:11.435 --> 39:12.436
Ariana, what's wrong?

39:13.604 --> 39:17.482
Hey, I thought I lost you.

39:18.734 --> 39:19.735
You want a drink?

39:20.444 --> 39:21.945
She's good.

39:22.029 --> 39:24.198
-I'd love one actually.
-Ari.

39:25.866 --> 39:29.161
I bet you'd like more than a drink. Huh?

39:45.385 --> 39:46.929
Ari, stop!

39:47.513 --> 39:49.389
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Get off me!

39:49.473 --> 39:50.766
You are a fucking piece of work.

39:50.849 --> 39:54.269
-I love you! You know that, right?
-Get the fuck off me. Get off me!

39:55.145 --> 39:56.188
Get off!

40:06.657 --> 40:07.783
You fuck.

40:11.537 --> 40:13.580
Ari, please. Don't do this.

40:13.664 --> 40:16.542
-I fucking told you!
-Please, I'm sorry. I'm s--

40:16.625 --> 40:17.918
No!

40:19.628 --> 40:20.629
Please don't do this.

40:28.011 --> 40:29.012
Sorry, Jerome.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.056
Ariana, please.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.475
Ari!

40:35.269 --> 40:36.520
Ari!

40:43.485 --> 40:44.486
She told you all that?

40:46.488 --> 40:47.489
Later, yeah.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.325
She must have trusted you a great deal.

40:52.286 --> 40:55.038
If the use of past tense is your way
of trying to catch me out--

40:55.122 --> 40:57.958
I'm just trying to get to the truth,
Danny.

41:12.723 --> 41:14.391
The fuck are you looking at?

41:14.892 --> 41:15.893
Yeah, yeah.

41:15.976 --> 41:18.145
What the fuck are you looking at?

42:13.742 --> 42:14.910
Ari.

42:25.671 --> 42:27.381
I need help.

42:28.715 --> 42:33.887
I think we can agree that
somebody that erratic can be a liability.

42:33.971 --> 42:37.057
-I never thought of her that way.
-She was fighting in nightclubs.

42:37.140 --> 42:39.768
Rockefeller Center was her idea,
wasn't it?

42:39.852 --> 42:41.728
-Well, technically--
-Is it possible, Danny,

42:41.812 --> 42:43.647
that, as much as you loved her,

42:43.730 --> 42:46.733
she was already heading down
a road where there was no coming back?

42:46.817 --> 42:50.362
No one could be blamed for thinking
that she didn't have a place with you all.

42:50.445 --> 42:52.990
-Maybe Yitzhak decided that she--
-Yitzhak would never hurt her.

42:54.366 --> 42:56.493
If Yitzhak didn't get rid of her,
then who did?

42:56.577 --> 42:59.288
What are you not telling me?
What are you not telling yourself?

43:02.124 --> 43:03.917
Is everything okay, ma'am?
