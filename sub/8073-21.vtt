00:04.738 --> 00:08.509
[theme music]

00:10.544 --> 00:12.713
Hey, DJ, haven't seen
you since I got home.

00:12.746 --> 00:13.547
Shut up.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.686
Oh, nice to see you too.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.454
School's going really well.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.923
Shut up.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.759
Yeah, the bus ride home
was nice, but unfortunately,

00:25.793 --> 00:27.495
I was sitting next to
this guy who kept singing

00:27.528 --> 00:28.496
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.698
I'm gonna kill you, Darlene.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.066
Not if I kill you first.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.002
Oh, you kids, if I had
a corpse for every time

00:35.035 --> 00:37.638
one of you said that.

00:37.671 --> 00:38.739
She won't shut up.
Shut up!

00:38.772 --> 00:40.141
Shut up!
Shut up!

00:40.174 --> 00:41.309
Shut up!

00:41.342 --> 00:42.676
How ironic--

00:42.710 --> 00:47.448
Grandma's strapped to a bed in
a loony bin, yet DJ walks free.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.682
What are you talking about?

00:48.716 --> 00:51.885
Well, thank you for
your sensitivity, Darlene.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.987
I was gonna tell you
about Grandma Conner.

00:54.021 --> 00:58.058
You know, last night your dad
had to put her into a home.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.261
What kind of home?

01:00.294 --> 01:06.267
A home, not unlike our own.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.637
She's in a mental institution.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.805
Is it because Grandma's crazy?

01:11.839 --> 01:15.776
No, it's because she's tired.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.478
Yeah, tired of being sane.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.784
Well, crazy is a
mean word to use, DJ.

01:23.817 --> 01:28.856
Your-- your grandmother
is just emotionally, um--

01:28.889 --> 01:32.126
well, she's had some emotional--

01:32.160 --> 01:36.730
uh, she's a tad nutty.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.966
How long has she
been like this?

01:38.999 --> 01:40.334
I don't know.

01:40.368 --> 01:43.070
Only in our family can someone
be a nutcase for 20 years

01:43.103 --> 01:45.839
without anyone noticing.

01:45.873 --> 01:46.740
We noticed, Darlene.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.343
We're just ignoring you.

01:49.377 --> 01:52.012
Did Grandma do crazy things?

01:52.045 --> 01:53.647
Well, there was
that one tip off.

01:53.681 --> 01:54.982
Remember when she
was in Florida?

01:55.015 --> 01:58.186
She sent us that postcard that
said, having a great time.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.954
Wish I was here.

02:00.988 --> 02:04.124
I don't think you should
be making fun of Grandma.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.693
We're not making fun, DJ.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.995
This is just our--
our way of coping.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.631
You know, instead of crying
and saying our grandmother's

02:10.664 --> 02:14.302
in a mental institution, we
say, uh, well, at least Grandma

02:14.335 --> 02:18.138
is with other people who share
her interest in hand-washing.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.276
Morning.

02:25.713 --> 02:26.580
Oh, man.

02:31.485 --> 02:35.256
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.

02:35.289 --> 02:38.926
Listen, I-- need
to talk about this.

02:38.959 --> 02:39.827
Why?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.195
It didn't happen to your mom.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.162
Yeah, I know.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.297
If it would have
happened to my mom,

02:43.331 --> 02:44.265
at least it would make sense.

02:48.168 --> 02:48.969
Talk.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.544
Well, I-- I just have
some questions is all.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.580
Um, you know, when your
parents got divorced--

02:59.613 --> 03:00.881
when was that?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.750
Uh, let's see.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.585
I was wearing a
size 8, so that's

03:04.618 --> 03:06.920
about 10 years ago, right?

03:06.954 --> 03:08.522
Right.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.691
And remember when your
mom got hospitalized

03:10.724 --> 03:12.293
for exhaustion then?

03:12.326 --> 03:16.129
Um, was that a mental hospital?

03:16.163 --> 03:17.631
Yes, it was a mental hospital.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.434
Her husband of 32 years
had just walked out on her.

03:20.468 --> 03:23.571
So she got a little
depressed, go figure.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.405
Were there other times?

03:27.608 --> 03:29.577
Once.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.445
ROSEANNE: Really?

03:31.479 --> 03:33.414
My dad just go
away on-- on business

03:33.447 --> 03:35.148
trips when I was a kid.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.386
I mean, one time he
took off without even

03:38.419 --> 03:41.755
telling my mom, two weeks,
no phone calls, no nothing.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.757
She didn't know where he was.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.526
He really did that?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.161
Yeah, he really did that.

03:48.195 --> 03:51.999
And in wrecked her
so bad that she had

03:52.032 --> 03:54.134
to go away for a little while.

03:54.167 --> 03:57.070
Man, I-- I just had no idea.

03:57.104 --> 04:02.776
Well, I told you that my
dad treated my mom like crap.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.111
Well, yeah, I know that.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.447
But, I mean, I didn't
know he was that bad.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.949
And I didn't know it-- that
it affected her so much.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.083
Well, of course
it affected her!

04:10.117 --> 04:12.019
He was horrible to her!

04:12.052 --> 04:16.357
It's amazing she held
up as well as she did.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.560
Well, so-- so it must have
been really hard on you,

04:19.593 --> 04:22.195
huh, Dan?

04:22.229 --> 04:23.731
No, it wasn't hard on me.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.032
It was hard for her.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.067
She made it OK for me!

04:27.100 --> 04:29.570
She was a great mother!

04:29.603 --> 04:31.104
She didn't teach her
kids to make jokes

04:31.138 --> 04:33.741
about things that aren't funny.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.209
Hey, the kids are just
trying to handle this, OK?

04:36.243 --> 04:38.712
We all feel really bad about
what happened to your mother.

04:38.746 --> 04:39.713
Really?

04:39.747 --> 04:40.914
Well, you could never
tell, of course,

04:40.948 --> 04:42.249
you could never tell
anybody give a damn

04:42.282 --> 04:43.451
about anything around here.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.053
All we do is yell at each
other and make jokes.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.955
Well, Dan, I'm really
upset that you've forgotten

04:47.988 --> 04:49.222
the occasional fist fight.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.126
That's perfect, Roseanne.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.868
I'm just-- I'm just
trying every way I know how.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.337
DAN: Try something else.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.273
[door slams]

05:06.306 --> 05:08.409
Hey, Mom, you know,
he probably just

05:08.442 --> 05:10.344
doesn't feel comfortable
talking to you

05:10.378 --> 05:12.112
because your mother
never went insane.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.616
Don't worry.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.550
I'll talk to him.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.994
[theme song playing]

06:03.864 --> 06:07.234
[laughter]

06:11.405 --> 06:12.773
So is Dan doing any better?

06:12.806 --> 06:15.976
No, he isn't,
and it just sucks.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.678
I mean, you know, he's
sleeping right next to me,

06:17.711 --> 06:20.414
but there's just nothing
I can do about it.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.683
And he's getting
really nasty too.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.385
I mean, you know, he
called me a bad mother--

06:25.419 --> 06:26.487
I think.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.288
I-- I couldn't really
hear him because DJ

06:28.321 --> 06:29.322
was running by with scissors.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.295
You're not a bad
mother, Roseanne.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.698
A bad mother thinks
one blanket is

06:37.731 --> 06:39.733
enough in the dead of winter.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.635
Where do you keep them, Jackie?

06:41.669 --> 06:44.104
In the basement
with the asbestos.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.945
Grandma to the rescue again.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.280
Breathe deep, old woman.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.590
It's just so weird, you know,
all that stuff he told me.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.591
I don't know.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.425
It's like his family's
way more screwed

07:05.459 --> 07:07.260
up than he ever let on before.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.597
Well, maybe he was ashamed.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.631
Ashamed?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.833
He's been married
to me for 21 years.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.969
You think he'd be
numb to shame by now.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.705
I don't know, Roseanne.
It is kind of bad.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.239
I mean, think about it.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.008
His mom beat our mom
to the loony bin.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.015
And I can't even get
him to talk about Audrie.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.183
You know, he's so defensive.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.085
It's like he has to believe
that she was like the world's

07:32.119 --> 07:33.887
greatest mother.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.824
Egad, imagine a child
loving his mother.

07:36.857 --> 07:40.728
I hope you can snap him
out of it, Roseanne.

07:40.761 --> 07:44.732
This is not about Dan
loving his mother, OK?

07:44.765 --> 07:46.767
You can still love your
mother, even though you know

07:46.800 --> 07:51.138
that she is a crazy old shrew.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.575
Don't think that I can't read
between those lines, Roseanne.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.256
Hey, Darlene?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.991
I was reading how if you're
grandmother's insane,

08:11.024 --> 08:13.193
there's a one-out-of-three
chance that you will be too.

08:13.226 --> 08:19.533
So there's a test for to look
for the early warning signs.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.968
Oh, man, not
another one of those

08:21.001 --> 08:24.605
inkblots that looks like
the devil stabbing me.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.539
Hey, guys.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.506
What are you doing?

08:26.540 --> 08:29.109
Oh, nothing,
just taking a test.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.644
Man, I hate tests.

08:30.678 --> 08:31.745
Oh, this one's different.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.046
When you're done with
this one, you don't

08:33.080 --> 08:34.381
hand the nurse a plastic cup.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.623
OK, question number one,
when you put your shoes on,

08:42.656 --> 08:44.625
do you put them on one at
a time or both at once?

08:44.658 --> 08:45.525
[door closes]

08:45.559 --> 08:46.994
Both at once.

08:47.027 --> 08:47.961
OK, that was an easy one.

08:50.598 --> 08:55.703
Question number two, what color
is the sound of a dog barking?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.304
Bright green.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.406
Green or bright green,
both are acceptable.

09:02.843 --> 09:07.080
Question number three, pick
one-- triangle, hat, or boat.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.682
Triangle?

09:08.716 --> 09:09.516
Boat.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.485
That's right.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.659
Question number
four, do you ever

09:18.692 --> 09:21.261
relive the same moment twice?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.295
No.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.797
Very good.

09:23.831 --> 09:24.898
Question number
four, do you ever

09:24.932 --> 09:26.333
relive the same moment twice?

09:28.836 --> 09:29.703
No.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.771
Very good.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.672
Hey, guys.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.640
What are you doing?

09:32.673 --> 09:36.243
Oh, nothing,
just taking a test.

09:36.276 --> 09:40.247
Man, I hate tests.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.348
Oh, this one's different.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.549
When you're done with
this one, you don't

09:42.582 --> 09:43.884
hand the nurse a plastic cup.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.394
Dan.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.163
Dan, now you're gonna
wake the babies now.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.331
Why don't you just calm down,
and Roseanne will be here

09:58.365 --> 09:59.633
any minute to take you home.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.901
(DRUNKENLY) No,
Crystal, I told you.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.369
I come here to
talk to my father.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.871
I'm not leaving until I do.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.172
I told you he's not here.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.373
He's on a business trip.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.075
What a surprise.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.609
Prepare yourself, Crystal.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.244
You may not hear from
him for two weeks.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.447
Dan, I-- I think
you should leave.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.684
Well, I don't think
Chip should leave.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.818
You know who I
think should leave?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.452
I think you should leave.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.688
I think you should
get away from him.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.588
Pack up his stuff.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.522
Grab the kids.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.391
I'll give you a hand.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.193
(SHOUTING) Hey,
Lonnie, get that chair.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.094
Dan!

10:27.127 --> 10:28.195
Dan, put that down.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.429
Lonnie, why don't--
why don't you go

10:29.462 --> 10:31.498
get Dan some nice hot coffee.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.967
Now-- now listen, I'm
married to your father,

10:34.001 --> 10:35.302
and I'm not leaving.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.536
Oh, come on, Crystal.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.571
Don't let him do to
you what he did to her.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.841
You haven't heard
your father's side.

10:40.874 --> 10:41.742
He's a good man.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.410
Dammit, he is not!

10:43.443 --> 10:45.212
Ah, Dan, you're scaring me!

10:45.245 --> 10:47.314
Look, Crystal, he
doesn't love you.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.150
He doesn't love the kids.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.752
He just goes away all the time.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.520
He leaves you alone by herself.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.356
And he comes back, and he says,
look, honey, I got you a lamp.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.594
Lonnie-- Lonnie, come here.

11:01.628 --> 11:02.930
Now, you've got to
talk to your mom.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.664
You got to tell her to
get out, because he's

11:04.698 --> 11:05.799
wrecking your family.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.934
No-- no, he's not!

11:06.967 --> 11:09.269
Dan, I forbid you to
talk to my son that way.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.404
Now-- now, why don't you
have a little coffee.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.372
You're not listening to me.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.907
Come on, you need it.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.343
This-- this is no way for you
to act in your father's house!

11:16.376 --> 11:19.012
I am not drinking
his damn coffee.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.914
[crash]

11:20.948 --> 11:22.649
Well, that's always
the first sign that he's

11:22.682 --> 11:23.550
had too much caffeine.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.521
Rosie, you got
nothing to do here.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.857
Just get out.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.725
No, Dan, that would be rude.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.660
Crystal would be very
insulted if I didn't

11:33.693 --> 11:36.329
throw a cup at the wall too.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.898
Well, I'm not
leaving, not till

11:37.931 --> 11:41.401
I talk to the son-of-a-bitch.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.936
Get out of our house!

11:42.970 --> 11:43.771
[sigh].

11:49.176 --> 11:51.511
Um, that was
pretty cute, Lonnie.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.382
But, you know, his ankle
is as big as your chest.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.450
Dan, if you're waiting
around to see your dad,

11:57.484 --> 11:59.019
um, you're waiting
in the wrong place

11:59.052 --> 12:00.954
'cause he's over at our house.

12:00.988 --> 12:01.889
What are you talking about?

12:01.922 --> 12:04.091
Yeah, isn't that
right, Crystal?

12:04.124 --> 12:07.194
Oh, right, that's
where he is, yes, sirree.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.129
Why the hell didn't
somebody tell me?

12:09.162 --> 12:12.499
Oh, because we wanted it to
be a big surprise, you know.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.067
Let's go!

12:14.101 --> 12:17.637
[grunting] Hey, Crystal?

12:17.670 --> 12:20.307
You know I'm only
doing this to help you.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.374
And you did, Dan.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.575
But now you're going
to go home and rest,

12:22.609 --> 12:24.477
so tomorrow, you'll be
able to help others.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.378
[kiss]

12:27.981 --> 12:30.818
[crickets]

12:40.293 --> 12:41.061
Morning, Otis.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.404
Boy, Dad, now that I'm in
college, let me tell you.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.173
I know exactly how you feel.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.578
But I find that if you just
start drinking right when you

12:58.611 --> 13:00.547
wake up, the hangover's gone.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.116
And, you know, you can go about
your day with full energy,

13:03.150 --> 13:07.787
whether it's going to classes
or, you know, raising a family.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.122
You're done, Darlene.

13:13.026 --> 13:18.031
Oh, Dad, I'm really
sorry about Grandma.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.366
I know.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.902
Oh, Darlene, time
to leave the house.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.037
You're just a painful
reminder of another bender

13:24.071 --> 13:24.872
your dad went on.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.881
Where's the rest
of the freeloaders?

13:33.914 --> 13:36.816
Well, I told him to get
lost, you know, um, because I

13:36.850 --> 13:39.086
thought that we would talk.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.888
Well, they didn't
have to leave the house.

13:40.921 --> 13:45.158
Well, I thought
we'd maybe talk loud.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.861
So what were you thinking
go on over there all drunk?

13:47.895 --> 13:50.797
Did you think you were gonna
go over there and beat him up?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.266
Maybe.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.234
Or at least barf on him.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.007
Well, Crystal called
me last night, you know.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.143
And she had some things to
say about your mom and dad.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.116
Listen to me, Dan.

14:09.149 --> 14:13.286
A person doesn't become mentally
ill because their spouse

14:13.320 --> 14:14.922
goes away on business trips.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.495
How in the hell can
you say that to me?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.268
Well, think about it, Dan.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.538
It can't all be his fault.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.173
Well, what are you saying?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.541
Oh, I see.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.210
You're telling me that if I
forgive him, I'll feel better.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.979
[chuckling] Why
didn't just say so.

14:39.012 --> 14:39.879
Done!

14:39.913 --> 14:40.813
Where's my tap shoes?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.188
This isn't just the
third time your mother's

14:48.221 --> 14:49.990
been hospitalized, Dan.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.425
It used to happen a lot
when you were a kid,

14:52.459 --> 14:56.863
and they told you that she
was visiting some relative.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.697
Well, she wasn't.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.335
Where the hell
did you hear that?

15:02.369 --> 15:03.436
Crystal.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.771
Oh, that's bull.

15:04.804 --> 15:08.008
My mother was in a bad marriage.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.443
No, Dan.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.279
Crystal told me
that your mom was

15:12.312 --> 15:15.215
in and out of a lot of hospitals
before your parents even met.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.683
Crystal's protecting him.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.252
Do you want to call
those hospitals and check?

15:19.286 --> 15:20.153
Stop defending him!

15:20.187 --> 15:21.588
Stop!

15:21.621 --> 15:24.257
He let you blame him
for everything, Dan.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.759
He took all your
crap all of his life

15:26.793 --> 15:29.196
just so he could keep your
mom looking good for you.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.530
No way.
No way.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.598
I'm not gonna let you do this.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.667
You are not going to
twist this around!

15:34.701 --> 15:37.570
He did a good thing, Dan.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.306
It didn't happen that way.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.174
What you're saying does
not make any sense.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.543
It makes perfect sense, Dan.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.511
Why, huh?

15:44.544 --> 15:45.578
Why?

15:45.612 --> 15:49.616
Why wouldn't he
tell me about it?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.584
Because maybe he knew he was
gonna be gone all the time.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.886
Maybe he figured it
would be easier for a kid

15:53.920 --> 15:56.656
to have a bastard for a
father than a crazy person

15:56.689 --> 15:59.259
for a mother!

15:59.292 --> 16:00.893
He made her that way.

16:00.927 --> 16:04.631
This was his fault.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.367
No, it wasn't his fault, Dan.

16:07.400 --> 16:13.106
And it wasn't her fault. And
it's not your fault either.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.580
[crying] I can't take this.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.115
Yeah, I know.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.050
I'm gonna take it with you.

16:27.087 --> 16:30.923
[crying]

16:36.963 --> 16:39.866
[ballgame on tv]

16:39.899 --> 16:42.769
[knocking]

16:50.743 --> 16:54.481
Oh, it's my son,
the tough guy.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.085
Is there some stuff that you
forgot to break last night?

16:58.118 --> 16:59.252
I just came to
help you clean up.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.087
Can I come in?

17:03.656 --> 17:04.991
[sigh].

17:05.024 --> 17:08.195
You know, when you were younger,
at least you had to courage

17:08.228 --> 17:10.397
to take your shots at me.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.698
Well, last night
you weren't here.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.266
[chuckles] Yeah,
well, my family was.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.801
Yeah, look, I'm
sorry about the things

17:14.834 --> 17:15.768
that I said to Crystal.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.237
Well, at least
Crystal, thankfully,

17:17.270 --> 17:19.772
is smart enough not to
listen to some drunk

17:19.806 --> 17:22.309
who's tearing up her house.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.877
Whoah, I broke the toaster?

17:24.911 --> 17:27.314
Man, I don't even remember
being in the kitchen last night.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.881
Come on, Danny, what
are we doing here?

17:28.915 --> 17:29.949
I can help you fix that.

17:29.982 --> 17:30.883
Stop it.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.753
I just want to
talk to you, Dad.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.055
I think we're way past it--

17:36.089 --> 17:37.624
way past talk.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.726
I mean, I got an idea.

17:39.759 --> 17:44.497
Why don't we just, uh, call
it quits, go separate ways.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.898
You're my father!
I'm your son.

17:45.932 --> 17:46.799
We can't do that.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.501
Why the hell not?

17:48.535 --> 17:49.569
We're both grown men.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.903
We don't need each
other anymore.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.272
Let's just say it's done.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.341
Come on, Dad.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.544
You know, it was different
when I was on my own, OK?

17:57.577 --> 18:01.248
But now I can't have you coming
over here and just scaring

18:01.281 --> 18:03.550
the hell out of my family.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.584
[sigh].

18:04.617 --> 18:08.388
I can't leave until
we talk about Mom.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.758
That's the difference
between you and me.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.727
You can't stop
living in the past.

18:14.761 --> 18:20.099
It's just-- [chuckling] I
ruined your mother's life.

18:20.133 --> 18:24.771
OK, see, I admit that.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.072
I can't keep apologizing.

18:36.283 --> 18:42.555
Crystal told Roseanne about
Mom, you know, her history.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.123
Well, she shouldn't
have done that.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.358
Maybe she shouldn't have.

18:45.392 --> 18:51.198
But [sighing] I wish you had.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.533
[sigh].

18:53.566 --> 18:56.169
Some things are private, Dan.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.204
I'm her son.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.338
Exactly.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.739
And I didn't want you
to go around thinking

18:59.772 --> 19:03.210
bad things about your mother,
because she was a good woman,

19:03.243 --> 19:04.043
still is.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.751
Dad, I know I--

19:11.784 --> 19:15.388
I've said some bad things
about you for a long time.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.290
I just want you to know
that I really appreciate--

19:17.324 --> 19:18.691
There-- there you go.
There you go.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.627
I mean, you're going-- you just
gonna drag the past up again,

19:20.660 --> 19:21.594
aren't you?
But don't.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.929
Don't.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.130
Look, you don't understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.932
I just want to tell you
that I really appreciate--

19:25.965 --> 19:30.537
(SHOUTING) Don't,
(QUIETLY) Danny.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.038
Just leave it alone.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.576
If that's the way you want it.

19:41.314 --> 19:45.318
Hey, that toaster is
not gonna fix itself.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.059
OK.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.193
I'll see you later.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.728
Hey, I thought you were
gonna fix this thing.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.633
You want me to?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.168
[scoffing] I didn't break it.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.410
There's a ballgame on here.
You mind if I watch?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.181
Sure.

20:15.214 --> 20:19.218
We can make it more
interesting, put 20 bucks on it.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.520
I'll take the Bulls.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.922
My house, I'll take the Bulls.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.728
[laughing] I
mean, this is wild.

20:28.761 --> 20:32.899
I don't even remember being
in the kitchen last night.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.601
You weren't.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.303
The thing's been
broken for months.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.183
Hey, DJ.

20:51.217 --> 20:55.221
I know you are just trying to
trick me with this stupid test.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.389
Oops, figured it out.

21:00.893 --> 21:01.828
[door closes]

21:01.861 --> 21:03.696
Hey, DJ.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.964
How'd you do that?

21:04.997 --> 21:05.798
Oops, figured it out.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.202
[door closes]

21:10.236 --> 21:11.170
Hey, DJ.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.572
You're not scaring me!

21:12.605 --> 21:15.041
Oops, figured it out.

21:15.074 --> 21:15.942
[door closes]

21:15.975 --> 21:16.843
Hey, DJ.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.777
Stop it!

21:17.810 --> 21:20.713
Oops, figured it out.

21:20.747 --> 21:21.681
Hey, DJ.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.582
[door closes]

21:22.615 --> 21:26.586
[screaming]

21:26.619 --> 21:27.787
What's the matter with him?

21:27.820 --> 21:31.090
[scoffs] Kid's losing it.
