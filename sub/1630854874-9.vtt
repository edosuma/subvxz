WEBVTT

00:31.564 --> 00:32.932
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:32.932 --> 00:33.700
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:33.700 --> 00:34.667
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.435
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:35.435 --> 00:35.902
US.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.404
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.339
FROM FOX AGREEING TO PAY NEARLY

00:39.339 --> 00:40.707
$800 MILLION FOR BROADCASTING

00:40.707 --> 00:42.108
LIES, TO THE U.K.'S DEPUTY PRIME

00:42.108 --> 00:43.510
MINISTER RESIGNING DUE TO A

00:43.510 --> 00:44.978
BULLYING INVESTIGATION.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.146
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START IN THE

00:46.146 --> 00:47.213
TENNESSEE HOUSE, WHERE

00:47.213 --> 00:48.148
REPUBLICANS RECENTLY VOTED TO

00:48.148 --> 00:49.849
EXPEL TWO DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS

00:49.849 --> 00:51.117
FOR VIOLATING HOUSE RULES IN

00:51.117 --> 00:53.052
PROTESTING AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE.

00:53.052 --> 00:56.556
ONE OF THE REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED

00:56.556 --> 00:57.390
TO EXPEL THEM WAS THIS MAN,

00:57.390 --> 01:00.126
SCOTTY CAMPBELL, WHO ABRUPTLY

01:00.126 --> 01:01.361
RESIGNED ON THURSDAY.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.061
AND I COULD TELL YOU WHY.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.830
BUT I'D RATHER LET YOU WATCH AS

01:03.830 --> 01:05.365
HE SEES HIS POLITICAL CAREER

01:05.365 --> 01:07.667
EVAPORATE BEFORE HIS EYES.

01:07.667 --> 01:12.972
AS I UNDERSTAND, YOU ADMITTED

01:12.972 --> 01:13.940
TO SEXUALLY HARASSING THIS

01:13.940 --> 01:14.174
INTERN?

01:14.174 --> 01:16.943
GIVE ME JUST FIVE SECONDS.

01:16.943 --> 01:17.377
OKAY.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.112
IN FACT, SCOTTY CAMPBELL

01:19.112 --> 01:19.779
ALREADY KNEW WE WERE

01:19.779 --> 01:20.580
INVESTIGATING SOME SERIOUS

01:20.580 --> 01:26.453
ALLEGATIONS.

01:26.453 --> 01:27.020
HOLD ON JUST A SECOND.

01:27.020 --> 01:27.754
ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:27.754 --> 01:28.388
AT LEAST ONE LEGISLATIVE INTERN,

01:28.388 --> 01:29.823
ALTHOUGH HE WOULD SOON DIVULGE

01:29.823 --> 01:31.090
THERE WAS A SECOND INTERN.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.692
WHICH DIRECTION DO I NEED TO

01:32.692 --> 01:33.159
LOOK FOR YOUR CAMERA?

01:33.159 --> 01:33.960
JUST LOOK AT ME.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.495
WOW.

01:35.495 --> 01:36.963
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF

01:36.963 --> 01:38.264
POLITICIANS GET CAUGHT OUT ON

01:38.264 --> 01:38.665
THIS SHOW.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.167
SOME GET ANGRY, SOME RUN AWAY.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.769
BUT IN TEN SEASONS, I HAVE NEVER

01:42.769 --> 01:43.903
SEEN SOMEONE SO THOROUGHLY

01:43.903 --> 01:46.406
FUCKED THEIR ONLY RESPONSE IS

01:46.406 --> 01:47.807
"GIVE ME FIVE SECONDS TO CHUG

01:47.807 --> 01:49.275
THIS," FOLLOWED BY "OKAY, WHERE

01:49.275 --> 01:51.010
SHOULD I LOOK WHILE MY CAREER

01:51.010 --> 01:51.311
ENDS?"

01:51.311 --> 01:54.180
KUDOS TO EVERYONE INVOLVED.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.081
SO IT TURNS OUT, A HOUSE ETHICS

01:55.081 --> 01:56.282
SUBCOMMITTEE FOUND LAST MONTH

01:56.282 --> 01:57.317
THAT CAMPBELL HAD VIOLATED THE

01:57.317 --> 01:58.117
POLICY ON WORKPLACE

01:58.117 --> 01:59.486
DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT.

01:59.486 --> 02:00.587
THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS THAT HE'D

02:00.587 --> 02:04.824
SEXUALLY HARASSED AT LEAST ONE

02:04.824 --> 02:05.425
INTERN, REPORTEDLY

02:05.425 --> 02:06.159
MAKING HER "PROGRESSIVELY MORE

02:06.159 --> 02:06.693
AFRAID AND UNCOMFORTABLE,"

02:06.693 --> 02:07.894
THROUGH ACTIONS LIKE, AT ONE

02:07.894 --> 02:08.962
POINT, OFFERING TO GIVE HER

02:08.962 --> 02:09.996
CANNABIS GUMMIES TO SEE HER

02:09.996 --> 02:11.498
TATTOOS AND PIERCINGS.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.132
THE SUBCOMMITTEE ISSUED THEIR

02:13.132 --> 02:15.702
FINDINGS LAST MONTH, BUT NOTHING

02:15.702 --> 02:17.003
HAPPENED UNTIL REPORTERS STARTED

02:17.003 --> 02:17.570
ASKING QUESTIONS.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.072
AND WHILE CAMPBELL DENIES THE

02:19.072 --> 02:20.340
ALLEGATIONS, IT'S NOT GREAT THAT

02:20.340 --> 02:21.174
HE ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO

02:21.174 --> 02:22.075
COMPREHEND SOME PRETTY BASIC

02:22.075 --> 02:23.409
THINGS.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.811
SO ARE YOU SAYING THE ETHICS

02:24.811 --> 02:26.312
SUBCOMMITTEE IS LYING?

02:26.312 --> 02:27.680
I'M SAYING THAT I DID NOT

02:27.680 --> 02:31.017
KNOW THAT A WORKPLACE POLICY

02:31.017 --> 02:32.886
COULD BE ENFORCED WHEN YOU'RE

02:32.886 --> 02:34.320
NOT AT WORK.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.188
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

02:35.188 --> 02:40.293
ABOUT?

02:40.293 --> 02:40.660
SCOTTY.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.461
I'M NOT SURE THAT SAYING,

02:41.461 --> 02:42.028
"WHATEVER I DID, I WASN'T AT

02:42.028 --> 02:42.495
WORK WHEN I DID IT!"

02:42.495 --> 02:43.663
IS QUITE THE IRONCLAD DEFENSE HE

02:43.663 --> 02:43.997
THINKS IT IS.

02:43.997 --> 02:44.631
IF YOUR OFFICE HAD A SIGN IN THE

02:44.631 --> 02:46.933
KITCHEN THAT SAID "PLEASE DO NOT

02:46.933 --> 02:47.634
FUCK THE KEURIG MACHINE," AND

02:47.634 --> 02:48.902
YOU RESPONDED BY TAKING IT

02:48.902 --> 02:50.570
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING AND FUCKING

02:50.570 --> 02:51.738
IT THERE, I THINK YOU'RE STILL

02:51.738 --> 02:53.373
PROBABLY GETTING INTO TROUBLE.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.675
AND LOOK, I COULD TALK ALL NIGHT

02:55.675 --> 02:56.576
ABOUT THIS STORY, BUT FOR NOW,

02:56.576 --> 02:58.211
LET'S TURN TO BEER.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.512
DRINKABLE BREAD THAT MAKES

02:59.512 --> 03:00.813
TALKING LESS SCARY.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.949
SPECIFICALLY, BUD LIGHT.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.817
THE BEER YOU'D GIVE A CHILD TO

03:04.817 --> 03:06.519
DRINK TO TEACH IT A LESSON.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.288
A FEW WEEKS AGO, BUD LIGHT

03:08.288 --> 03:09.589
PARTNERED WITH INFLUENCER

03:09.589 --> 03:10.990
DYLAN MULVANEY FOR THE SORT OF

03:10.990 --> 03:12.058
INSTAGRAM PROMOTION YOU SEE ALL

03:12.058 --> 03:13.226
THE TIME.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.260
CHECK OUT MY INSTAGRAM STORY

03:14.260 --> 03:16.563
TO SEE HOW YOU CAN ENJOY MARCH

03:16.563 --> 03:18.932
MADNESS WITH BUD LIGHT AND MAYBE

03:18.932 --> 03:20.166
WIN SOME MONEY, TOO!

03:20.166 --> 03:21.200
OKAY.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.969
SEEMS BASICALLY AS INOFFENSIVE

03:22.969 --> 03:23.970
AS AN AD CAN BE WHEN IT'S

03:23.970 --> 03:25.572
PROMOTING BUD LIGHT, A BEER THAT

03:25.572 --> 03:26.673
ASKS THE QUESTION "ARE WE

03:26.673 --> 03:27.440
ALLOWED TO CALL CAT'S URINE

03:27.440 --> 03:28.608
BEER?

03:28.608 --> 03:29.709
BECAUSE IF NOT, THIS FACTORY

03:29.709 --> 03:31.511
TOUR IS OVER."

03:31.511 --> 03:32.946
BUT PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT

03:32.946 --> 03:34.814
ABSOLUTELY LOST THEIR SHIT OVER

03:34.814 --> 03:35.615
THIS, BECAUSE BUD LIGHT

03:35.615 --> 03:37.417
PARTNERED WITH A TRANS WOMAN.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.485
THERE'VE BEEN CALLS FOR

03:39.485 --> 03:42.021
BOYCOTTS, AND THIS INCREDIBLY

03:42.021 --> 03:43.089
STUPID VIDEO FROM KID ROCK.

03:43.089 --> 03:44.624
LET ME SAY SOMETHING TO ALL

03:44.624 --> 03:46.693
YOU AND BE AS CLEAR AND CONCISE

03:46.693 --> 03:53.399
AS POSSIBLE.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.743
FUCK BUD LIGHT.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.844
AND FUCK ANHEUSER-BUSCH.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.212
HAVE A TERRIFIC DAY.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.947
OKAY, A FEW THINGS.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.082
FIRST, I DON'T THINK THERE'S A

04:09.082 --> 04:10.183
MORE DANGEROUS WAY TO DISPOSE OF

04:10.183 --> 04:11.384
BUD LIGHT, OTHER THAN OF COURSE

04:11.384 --> 04:13.620
DRINKING IT.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.622
AND SECOND, NOT TO GUN-SHAME

04:15.622 --> 04:16.923
CHILD ROCK HERE, BUT YOU'RE 20

04:16.923 --> 04:20.326
YARDS AWAY FROM A TARGET THAT'S

04:20.326 --> 04:20.927
BRIGHT, IDENTIFIABLE AND,

04:20.927 --> 04:22.061
CRUCIALLY, STATIONARY, AND

04:22.061 --> 04:22.996
YOU'RE SPRAYING BULLETS ALL OVER

04:22.996 --> 04:24.030
THE PLACE.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.231
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY IT SURE SEEMS

04:25.231 --> 04:27.100
LIKE HE MAY HAVE HAD HELP.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.935
BECAUSE IF YOU WATCH IT SLOWED

04:28.935 --> 04:30.203
DOWN, YOU'LL NOTICE THE THREE

04:30.203 --> 04:32.305
BLASTS THAT ACTUALLY DESTROY THE

04:32.305 --> 04:33.239
CASES APPEAR TO BE COMING FROM

04:33.239 --> 04:34.841
THE RIGHT.

04:34.841 --> 04:37.910
AND THE THING IS, IT'S NOT JUST

04:37.910 --> 04:39.579
52-YEAR-OLDS NAMED "KID" DOING

04:39.579 --> 04:40.413
THIS, THERE'VE BEEN MULTIPLE

04:40.413 --> 04:42.382
VIDEOS OF PEOPLE DESTROYING CANS

04:42.382 --> 04:43.683
OF BUD LIGHT, AND OTHER

04:43.683 --> 04:44.817
ANHEUSER-BUSCH BRANDS.

04:44.817 --> 04:45.618
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING

04:45.618 --> 04:46.719
THAT HURTS A COMPANY, IT'S

04:46.719 --> 04:47.787
DESTROYING THEIR PRODUCT AFTER

04:47.787 --> 04:49.756
IT'S ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.424
AND LOOK, THIS IS ALL VERY

04:51.424 --> 04:52.525
STUPID, BUT THERE'S SOME REAL

04:52.525 --> 04:54.661
NASTINESS UNDER ALL THIS.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.095
IT'S PART OF A GENERAL MORAL

04:56.095 --> 04:57.563
PANIC AROUND TRANS RIGHTS,

04:57.563 --> 04:58.731
ARRIVING AT THE SAME TIME AS A

04:58.731 --> 04:59.799
RASH OF BILLS BANNING

04:59.799 --> 05:00.867
GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE FOR KIDS

05:00.867 --> 05:01.801
AND-- IN SOME STATES-- ADULTS

05:01.801 --> 05:03.169
AS WELL.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.570
AND MADDENINGLY,

05:04.570 --> 05:05.672
ANHEUSER-BUSCH'S RESPONSE TO

05:05.672 --> 05:07.140
THAT UGLINESS HAS BEEN TO

05:07.140 --> 05:08.975
EQUIVOCATE IN THE FACE OF IT.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.877
ITS CEO PUT OUT A STATEMENT

05:10.877 --> 05:11.944
SAYING, "WE NEVER INTENDED TO BE

05:11.944 --> 05:12.679
PART OF A DISCUSSION THAT

05:12.679 --> 05:13.846
DIVIDES PEOPLE.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.415
WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF

05:15.415 --> 05:16.716
BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER OVER A

05:16.716 --> 05:18.017
BEER."

05:18.017 --> 05:19.519
WHICH, SURE, ALTHOUGH AGAIN, NOT

05:19.519 --> 05:20.520
TECHNICALLY "BEER" SO MUCH AS IT

05:20.520 --> 05:22.121
IS "FIZZY WATER SWISHED AROUND A

05:22.121 --> 05:24.557
DOG'S MOUTH."

05:24.557 --> 05:26.292
AND IT'S PRETTY ANNOYING TO BE

05:26.292 --> 05:27.760
"BOTH-SIDES"ING SOMETHING WHEN

05:27.760 --> 05:28.728
THE TWO SIDES ARE, "I AM TRANS"

05:28.728 --> 05:30.730
AND "THAT MAKES ME SO MAD I'M

05:30.730 --> 05:31.564
GOING TO SHOOT $65 WORTH OF

05:31.564 --> 05:35.268
NON-REFUNDABLE BEER."

05:35.268 --> 05:37.103
AND BUDWEISER JUST RELEASED THIS

05:37.103 --> 05:38.237
EQUALLY EMPTY NEW AD.

05:38.237 --> 05:41.140
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT

05:41.140 --> 05:44.377
A BEER, ROOTED IN THE HEART OF

05:44.377 --> 05:47.947
AMERICA.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.383
FOUND IN A COMMUNITY WHERE A

05:50.383 --> 05:53.419
HANDSHAKE IS A SURE CONTRACT.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.456
RAISED BY GENERATIONS WILLING TO

05:56.456 --> 06:05.164
SIP, SHARE, RISK, REMEMBER.

06:05.164 --> 06:05.732
THIS IS A STORY BIGGER THAN

06:05.732 --> 06:11.571
BEER.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.272
THIS IS THE STORY OF THE

06:13.272 --> 06:18.444
AMERICAN SPIRIT.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.679
OKAY.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.013
THERE'S BOTH NOTHING AND A LOT

06:21.013 --> 06:23.082
GOING ON THERE.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.550
THEY'RE CLEARLY SO AFRAID OF

06:24.550 --> 06:26.352
OFFENDING ANYONE, THEY PUT OUT

06:26.352 --> 06:27.386
AN AD ESSENTIALLY SAYING,

06:27.386 --> 06:29.021
"AMERICA SOMETHING SOMETHING,"

06:29.021 --> 06:30.490
AND MADE A POINT OF STOPPING

06:30.490 --> 06:31.958
DOWN, FOR SOME REASON, AT A SHOT

06:31.958 --> 06:33.059
OF THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE SO

06:33.059 --> 06:34.627
THEY COULD SAY, "REMEMBER."

06:34.627 --> 06:35.695
IS THAT A 9/11 REFERENCE,

06:35.695 --> 06:37.663
BUDWEISER?

06:37.663 --> 06:39.031
BECAUSE SHOTS OF A HORSE RUNNING

06:39.031 --> 06:40.032
THROUGH THE PLAINS AND "REMEMBER

06:40.032 --> 06:42.034
9/11" FEEL LESS LIKE AN AD AND

06:42.034 --> 06:44.303
MORE LIKE THE RESULTS OF FEEDING

06:44.303 --> 06:44.804
AN AI PROGRAM THE PROMPT

06:44.804 --> 06:48.274
"AMERICA FREEDOM I'M SORRY."

06:48.274 --> 06:50.076
THIS FEELS LIKE A HUGE MISFIRE

06:50.076 --> 06:51.210
FOR ANHEUSER-BUSCH.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.645
BECAUSE WHEN BIGOTS ARE LOUDLY

06:52.645 --> 06:53.980
ANNOUNCING THEY DON'T LIKE YOUR

06:53.980 --> 06:56.883
BEER, BECAUSE THEY ARE BIGOTS,

06:56.883 --> 06:58.251
THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY,

06:58.251 --> 06:59.719
"THEN OUR BEER IS NOT FOR YOU."

06:59.719 --> 07:01.220
BUT IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO COZY

07:01.220 --> 07:02.989
UP TO THEM WITH PLATITUDES,

07:02.989 --> 07:04.724
STOCK FOOTAGE AND, FRANKLY,

07:04.724 --> 07:06.125
DISTRACTINGLY FUCKABLE HORSES--

07:06.125 --> 07:08.928
WHY NOT AT LEAST REALLY GO FOR

07:08.928 --> 07:12.965
IT?

07:12.965 --> 07:15.501
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT

07:15.501 --> 07:16.369
A BEER.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.604
ONE THAT BELIEVES IN SIMPLE

07:18.604 --> 07:21.741
VALUES LIKE FLAG, HELLO, AND

07:21.741 --> 07:22.842
TROOPS.

07:22.842 --> 07:23.910
A BEER THAT ADMITTEDLY DOES

07:23.910 --> 07:27.413
TASTE LIKE THE DASH YOU MAKE

07:27.413 --> 07:28.347
AFTER YOU DRINK BETTER OF YOUR

07:28.347 --> 07:30.183
APPEAR TO BUT IT'S MORE THAN

07:30.183 --> 07:31.450
THAT, IT'S ABOUT HORSES AND

07:31.450 --> 07:33.519
LIVING YOUR LIFE HOWEVER YOU

07:33.519 --> 07:34.887
CHOOSE.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.522
UNLESS OF COURSE THAT FREEDOM

07:36.522 --> 07:37.924
ALIENATES OUR BASE OF FRAT

07:37.924 --> 07:39.258
GROSS.

07:39.258 --> 07:39.659
ON-DUTY COPS.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.161
AN EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLE DADS.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.963
HONESTLY, WE ARE RUNNING SCARED

07:43.963 --> 07:45.698
BECAUSE KID ROCK TOLD HIS

07:45.698 --> 07:46.766
FOLLOWERS OUR BEER WAS WOKE

07:46.766 --> 07:48.334
INSTEAD OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS,

07:48.334 --> 07:50.002
WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU RING OUT A

07:50.002 --> 07:52.171
BAR RAG AT THE END OF A SHIFT AT

07:52.171 --> 07:52.705
ANY BAR.

07:52.705 --> 07:53.372
TO THAT END.

07:53.372 --> 07:56.409
WE ARE HOPING TO MAKE AN AD THAT

07:56.409 --> 07:56.976
WOULDN'T OFFEND ANYBODY.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.411
SO WHAT'S OUR BEER ABOUT?

07:58.411 --> 07:58.845
OUR BEERS ABOUT THE

07:58.845 --> 07:59.679
GRAND CANYON.

07:59.679 --> 08:00.713
TRAINS.

08:00.713 --> 08:01.314
AND DOGS BEING REUNITED WITH

08:01.314 --> 08:04.617
SOLDIERS.

08:04.617 --> 08:10.323
IT'S ABOUT FIREWORKS, ONE KID

08:10.323 --> 08:11.657
PUSHING ANOTHER KID IN A WAGON.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.258
SHARKS, AMERICAN-MADE SHARKS.

08:12.258 --> 08:12.892
SHARKS WHO GO TO CHURCH.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.360
IT'S ABOUT HOT DOGS.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.928
LANDING ON THE MOON.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.064
REMEMBERING 9/11.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.199
AND THE CIVIL WAR.

08:20.199 --> 08:24.070
WHICHEVER SIDE YOU LIKE, IT IS.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.572
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, PLEASE,

08:26.572 --> 08:27.573
BUY OUR AWFUL BEER.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.241
TO DRINK, TO SHOOT, WE DON'T

08:28.241 --> 08:30.776
CARE.

08:30.776 --> 08:31.577
WE NEVER CREATED IT TO BE

08:31.577 --> 08:31.811
ENJOYED.

08:31.811 --> 08:32.812
JUST PURCHASED.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.248
BUD LIGHT.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.217
MOVING ON.

08:38.818 --> 08:39.485
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:39.485 --> 08:40.620
CRYPTOCURRENCY.

08:40.620 --> 08:41.787
THE ONLY WORD THAT MAKES ELON

08:41.787 --> 08:44.824
MUSK NUT IMMEDIATELY.

08:44.824 --> 08:45.424
WE FIRST COVERED CRYPTO FIVE

08:45.424 --> 08:50.029
YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS

08:50.029 --> 08:50.663
YOUNGER, AND SINCE THEN, A LOT'S

08:50.663 --> 08:51.330
HAPPENED, INCLUDING,

08:51.330 --> 08:51.998
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS VIDEO FROM

08:51.998 --> 08:52.932
JUST LAST YEAR PROMOTING THE

08:52.932 --> 08:53.599
GENERAL CONCEPT OF TRADING

09:23.296 --> 09:24.530
SONG BY ONE OF OUR GREATEST

CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS "A NO CHAIR

09:39.879 --> 09:43.716
"THE COOL ONE" IN THAT FAMILY.

09:43.716 --> 09:44.617

09:44.617 --> 09:44.917
SONG SHE DID.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.551
SHE ALSO DID THIS ONE ABOUT HOW

09:45.551 --> 09:46.218

CRYPTO!"

10:01.867 --> 10:03.302
IS A PHRASE THAT'S AGED ABOUT AS

10:03.302 --> 10:04.270
WELL AS "WELCOME ABOARD THE

10:04.270 --> 10:07.406
UNSINKABLE TITANIC!"

10:07.406 --> 10:08.641
THOSE VIDEOS CAME OUT WHEN

10:08.641 --> 10:10.509
CRYPTO FEVER WAS STILL NEAR ITS

10:10.509 --> 10:11.477
ABSOLUTE PEAK.

10:11.477 --> 10:12.645
STADIUMS WERE GETTING NAMED

10:12.645 --> 10:14.513
AFTER CRYPTO COMPANIES,

10:14.513 --> 10:16.315
MATT DAMON AND LEBRON JAMES DID

10:16.315 --> 10:17.316
COMMERCIALS FOR Crypto.com AND

10:17.316 --> 10:19.885
CELEBRITIES FROM LARRY DAVID TO

10:19.885 --> 10:21.587
TOM & GISELE PRE-DIVORCE BUT

10:21.587 --> 10:22.688
POST-LOVE, HYPED A CRYPTO

10:22.688 --> 10:35.901
EXCHANGE CALLED

10:35.901 --> 10:36.502
RUN BY A SUPPOSED 29-YEAR-OLD

10:36.502 --> 10:37.103
GENIUS SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, AKA

10:37.103 --> 10:37.303
"SBF."

10:37.303 --> 10:37.937
HE WAS ON THE COVER OF

10:37.937 --> 10:38.504
FORBES AND FORTUNE, WITH ONE

10:38.504 --> 10:39.171
CALLING HIM "THE NEXT WARREN

10:39.171 --> 10:39.972
BUFFET," AND OTHERS CALLING HIM

10:39.972 --> 10:40.439
"JPEG MORGAN."

10:40.439 --> 10:41.073
AND SEQUOIA CAPITAL, ONE OF THE

10:41.073 --> 10:41.907
BIGGEST VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS,

10:41.907 --> 10:42.875
HAD A $213 MILLION INVESTMENT IN

10:42.875 --> 10:44.043
THE COMPANY.

10:44.043 --> 10:44.977
BUT SINCE THEN, TO PUT IT

10:44.977 --> 10:46.379
MILDLY, THERE HAS BEEN AN

10:46.379 --> 10:48.014
IMPLOSION, WHICH REALLY BROKE

10:48.014 --> 10:49.015
THROUGH TO PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS

10:49.015 --> 10:50.816
JUST BEFORE LAST CHRISTMAS.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.984
IN A SPAN OF 24 HOURS,

10:51.984 --> 10:53.252
SAM BANKMAN FRIED WAS WHISKED BY

10:53.252 --> 10:58.591
FEDERAL AGENTS IN THE BAHAMAS TO

10:58.591 --> 10:59.258
NEW YORK CITY WHERE HE FACED A

10:59.258 --> 11:00.593
JUDGE AND WALKED OUT OF A

11:00.593 --> 11:02.561
FEDERAL COURTHOUSE AFTER POSTING

11:02.561 --> 11:04.997
BAIL ON A $250 MILLION BOND,

11:04.997 --> 11:06.966
WHICH PROSECUTORS BELIEVE IS ONE

11:06.966 --> 11:09.035
OF THE LARGEST IN U.S. HISTORY.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.236
RIGHT, SBF WAS ARRESTED

11:10.236 --> 11:12.338
FOR DEFRAUDING HIS CUSTOMERS OUT

11:12.338 --> 11:13.139
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND TO

11:13.139 --> 11:15.007
BE HONEST, IT SEEMS LIKE THE

11:15.007 --> 11:16.008
COURTROOM SKETCH ARTIST MAY HAVE

11:16.008 --> 11:17.009
BEEN ONE OF THEM, BECAUSE THIS

11:17.009 --> 11:18.310
IS ONE OF THE RUDEST

11:18.310 --> 11:21.047
ILLUSTRATIONS I'VE EVER SEEN.

11:21.047 --> 11:21.914
THE WHOLE "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN

11:21.914 --> 11:23.149
GUILTY" THING CLEARLY DOESN'T

11:23.149 --> 11:24.250
APPLY TO THE SIDE OF THE LAW

11:24.250 --> 11:26.652
WITH THE COLORING PENCILS.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.721
SBF'S ARREST WAS A BIG DEAL.

11:28.721 --> 11:29.822
AND AS HIS COMPANY IMPLODED,

11:29.822 --> 11:31.757
SOME, LIKE CNBC'S JIM CRAMER,

11:31.757 --> 11:33.793
WERE FURIOUS.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.828
THAT GUY IS A CLUELESS IDIOT.

11:35.828 --> 11:36.529
HE'S A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.797
HE'S A CON MAN.

11:37.797 --> 11:38.831
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEARLY FOUR

11:38.831 --> 11:40.433
YEARS OF GETTING AWAY WITH

11:40.433 --> 11:42.535
FINANCIAL MURDER JUST BECAUSE

11:42.535 --> 11:42.835
THEY COULD.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.003
WOW, THOSE ARE SOME

11:44.003 --> 11:44.904
HARSH WORDS THERE FROM THE

11:44.904 --> 11:45.971
SQUAWKING PARROT ON EVERY

11:45.971 --> 11:47.973
PIRATE'S SHOULDER.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.009
ESPECIALLY AS, JUST A YEAR

11:50.009 --> 11:52.244
EARLIER, CRAMER WAS SAYING THIS.

11:52.244 --> 11:56.615
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO

11:56.615 --> 11:57.116
EDUCATE OURSELVES WITH

11:57.116 --> 11:57.650
SAM BANKMAN-FRIED.

11:57.650 --> 11:58.818
WELL, SAM, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

11:58.818 --> 11:59.385
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY

11:59.385 --> 12:00.052
MUCH A VISIONARY.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.353
YEAH, NOT GREAT, BUT

12:01.353 --> 12:02.555
ALSO NOT SURPRISING.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.823
AFTER ALL, THIS IS THE SAME GUY

12:03.823 --> 12:05.424
THAT PROCLAIMED THAT "BEAR

12:05.424 --> 12:08.327
STEARNS IS FINE" LITERAL DAYS

12:08.327 --> 12:08.928
BEFORE IT FOLDED, TOLD HIS

12:08.928 --> 12:10.162
VIEWERS TO BUY NETFLIX RIGHT

12:10.162 --> 12:11.897
BEFORE IT LOST ALMOST 70% IN

12:11.897 --> 12:12.965
FIVE MONTHS, AND ONCE-- AND

12:12.965 --> 12:14.133
THIS IS TRUE-- SAID THAT

12:14.133 --> 12:15.034
GOOGLE, FACEBOOK AND TWITTER

12:15.034 --> 12:16.335
SHOULD HIRE KEVIN SPACEY AS A

12:16.335 --> 12:17.236
SPOKESPERSON.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.406
JIM CRAMER IS THE ONLY PERSON

12:20.406 --> 12:21.006
WHO COULD LOOK YOU IN THE EYE,

12:21.006 --> 12:21.707
SAY "YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

12:21.707 --> 12:23.242
TOMORROW," AND GIVE YOU AN

12:23.242 --> 12:24.610
IMMEDIATE SENSE OF CALM, KNOWING

12:24.610 --> 12:25.911
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE FOR ANOTHER

12:25.911 --> 12:28.347
50 YEARS.

12:28.347 --> 12:29.448
BUT FTX HAS BEEN JUST ONE OF THE

12:29.448 --> 12:30.783
MANY DOMINOS THAT FELL IN THE

12:30.783 --> 12:32.151
CRYPTO WORLD.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.519
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE

12:33.519 --> 12:34.620
MARKET VALUE OF ALL

12:34.620 --> 12:37.823
CRYPTOCURRENCIES FELL FROM ABOUT

12:37.823 --> 12:39.458
$3 TRILLION IN LATE 2021 TO

12:39.458 --> 12:40.926
AROUND $1 TRILLION LAST YEAR.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.528
AND THERE ARE SMALL INVESTORS

12:42.528 --> 12:44.730
WHO GOT BADLY HURT BY ALL THIS.

12:44.730 --> 12:47.967
1 IN 5 AMERICANS HAS INVESTED

12:47.967 --> 12:48.667
IN, TRADED, OR USED

12:48.667 --> 12:49.301
CRYPTOCURRENCY.

12:49.301 --> 12:50.436
AND YOU CAN FIND COUNTLESS

12:50.436 --> 12:54.039
STORIES OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR

12:54.039 --> 12:55.141
LIFE'S SAVINGS IN THE

12:55.141 --> 12:55.708
RECENT IMPLOSIONS.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.308
UNDERSCORING THAT EVERYONE IN

12:56.308 --> 12:58.377
CRYPTO WAS NEVER GOING TO

12:58.377 --> 12:59.845
"MAKE IT," NO MATTER HOW MUCH

12:59.845 --> 13:00.713
RANDI ZUCKERBERG SCREAM-SANG

13:00.713 --> 13:02.348
OTHERWISE.

13:02.348 --> 13:03.616
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE

13:03.616 --> 13:04.750
A LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING

13:04.750 --> 13:06.085
IN THE WORLD OF CRYPTO BY

13:06.085 --> 13:08.587
LOOKING AT THREE OF THE BIGGEST

13:08.587 --> 13:09.622
COLLAPSES OVER THE PAST YEAR.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.689
EACH OF THESE COMPANIES WAS

13:10.689 --> 13:12.224
FOUNDED ON THE PROMISE THEY'D

13:12.224 --> 13:13.659
REPLACE SOME PART OF OUR

13:13.659 --> 13:14.793
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.428
THERE'S TERRA, A CRYPTOCURRENCY.

13:16.428 --> 13:19.064
CELSIUS, A CRYPTO "BANK."

13:19.064 --> 13:20.599
AND FTX, A CRYPTO TRADING

13:20.599 --> 13:21.267
PLATFORM.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.669
IN THEORY, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

13:23.669 --> 13:24.236
BE OUR NEXT DOLLAR, OUR NEXT

13:24.236 --> 13:25.504
BANK OF AMERICA, AND OUR NEXT

13:25.504 --> 13:27.573
STOCK EXCHANGE.

13:27.573 --> 13:28.073
BUT IN REALITY, THEY'RE

13:28.073 --> 13:29.508
FIASCOES.

13:29.508 --> 13:30.910
AND BEFORE WE EVEN START, WE'RE

13:30.910 --> 13:32.745
NOT GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE

13:32.745 --> 13:33.445
MERITS OR THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE

13:33.445 --> 13:34.947
BLOCKCHAIN.

13:34.947 --> 13:35.881
WE DID THAT FIVE YEARS AGO, IT'S

13:35.881 --> 13:37.316
STILL ON THE INTERNET, YOU CAN

13:37.316 --> 13:37.917
GO WATCH IT THERE.

13:37.917 --> 13:38.951
OR NOT.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.519
NOT WATCHING THIS SHOW IS ALWAYS

13:40.519 --> 13:42.054
A STRONG OPTION FOR YOU.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.156
BUT JUST AS A REMINDER, EVERY

13:44.156 --> 13:45.758
SINGLE CRYPTO COIN IS JUST

13:45.758 --> 13:47.092
SOMETHING SOMEONE WITH A LAPTOP

13:47.092 --> 13:48.394
MADE UP.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.329
THAT'S TRUE FOR ALL OF THEM,

13:50.329 --> 13:52.965
LIKE DOGECOIN, CAT COIN, PANDA

13:52.965 --> 13:54.500
COIN, FURRY COIN, CUMROCKET,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.036
ELONSPERM, AND MONKEYJIZZ.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.538
THOSE ARE ALL REAL BY THE WAY.

13:59.538 --> 14:00.673
WE WERE GOING TO COME UP WITH A

14:00.673 --> 14:02.241
FAKE ONE AS A JOKE, BUT THEN WE

14:02.241 --> 14:02.908
SAW MONKEYJIZZ AND IT FELT LIKE

14:02.908 --> 14:05.611
A HAT ON A HAT.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.846
TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THESE COINS

14:07.846 --> 14:12.051
HAVE VALUE, IT'S BASED ON

14:12.051 --> 14:12.651
WHETHER PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY

14:12.651 --> 14:13.252
DO, WHICH OFTEN COMES DOWN TO

14:13.252 --> 14:14.687
THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE PERSON

14:14.687 --> 14:15.521
OR GROUP WHO MADE THE COIN.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.156
AND THAT BASIC FACT MAKES THE

14:17.156 --> 14:19.592
CRYPTO BUSINESS VERY ATTRACTIVE

14:19.592 --> 14:21.493
TO A CERTAIN TYPE OF PERSON.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.762
ONE COLUMNIST WHO'S COVERED THIS

14:23.762 --> 14:24.930
INTENSIVELY SUMMED IT UP LIKE

14:24.930 --> 14:26.966
IF YOU ARE RUNNING A SCAM,

14:26.966 --> 14:28.400
YOU WILL BE DRAWN TO CRYPTO.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.569
YOU ARE RUNNING A CONFIDENCE

14:30.569 --> 14:33.072
GAME, AND CRYPTO OFFERS THE MOST

14:33.072 --> 14:35.774
EFFICIENT MARKET FOR TURNING

14:35.774 --> 14:36.242
CONFIDENCE INTO MONEY.

14:36.242 --> 14:36.942
AND THE STORY FOR ALL THREE

14:36.942 --> 14:37.743
COMPANIES WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT

14:37.743 --> 14:39.445
TONIGHT IS ONE OF CONFIDENCE

14:39.445 --> 14:40.212
GAINED, AND THEN SQUANDERED.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.348
LET'S START WITH TERRA, WHICH

14:42.348 --> 14:44.717
WAS A CRYPTOCURRENCY LAUNCHED IN

14:44.717 --> 14:45.751
2018 BY A BRASH SOUTH KOREAN

14:45.751 --> 14:47.686
ENTREPRENEUR NAMED DO KWON.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.088
PEOPLE HAD FAITH IN TERRA, IN

14:49.088 --> 14:49.955
PART, BECAUSE KWON EXUDED

14:49.955 --> 14:51.991
CONFIDENCE.

14:51.991 --> 14:52.791
HERE HE IS ON TWITCH, RESPONDING

14:52.791 --> 14:54.960
TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE

14:54.960 --> 14:55.561
VOLATILITY OF COMPANIES IN HIS

14:55.561 --> 14:57.129
SPACE.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.298
I WONDER HOW MANY OF THESE

14:59.298 --> 15:00.432
COMPANIES YOU THINK ARE ENTERING

15:00.432 --> 15:01.300
THIS SPACE JUST BECAUSE IT'S HOT

15:01.300 --> 15:03.035
AND THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDING

15:03.035 --> 15:04.270
VERSUS THE ONES THAT WILL STILL

15:04.270 --> 15:06.038
BE HERE, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 2-5

15:06.038 --> 15:09.675
YEARS LATER?

15:09.675 --> 15:10.342
OH, 95% OF ARE GOING TO DIE.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.512
95% ARE GOING TO DIE.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.114
BUT THERE'S ALSO ENTERTAINMENT

15:15.114 --> 15:16.815
IN WATCHING COMPANIES DIE TOO.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.384
I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY

15:18.384 --> 15:19.952
COCKY, BUT I GUESS HE'S RIGHT.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.086
THERE CAN BE ENTERTAINMENT IN

15:21.086 --> 15:22.788
WATCHING A COMPANY DIE.

15:22.788 --> 15:23.656
INCIDENTALLY, I BELIEVE THAT'S

15:23.656 --> 15:25.157
THE NEW SLOGAN FOR MAX.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.293
HEY, DO YOU LIKE HBO, BUT WANT

15:27.293 --> 15:28.294
ADS, THE PROPERTY BROTHERS, AND

15:28.294 --> 15:29.194
ALSO DON'T LIKE HBO?

15:29.194 --> 15:30.362
MAX!

15:30.362 --> 15:31.163
THERE'S ENTERTAINMENT IN

15:31.163 --> 15:33.532
WATCHING A COMPANY DIE!

15:33.532 --> 15:35.334
KWON'S COMPANY MADE SOMETHING

15:35.334 --> 15:36.702
CALLED A "STABLECOIN," THE IDEA

15:36.702 --> 15:38.837
OF WHICH IS-- UNLIKE SOMETHING

15:38.837 --> 15:39.471
LIKE BITCOIN-- IT WOULD ALWAYS

15:39.471 --> 15:43.709
BE WORTH A STABLE AMOUNT.

15:43.709 --> 15:44.476
SO, ONE UNIT OF TERRA-- OR

15:44.476 --> 15:46.078
"UST"-- WOULD ALWAYS EQUAL ONE

15:46.078 --> 15:47.646
U.S. DOLLAR.

15:47.646 --> 15:48.781
AND THE WAY THEY GUARANTEED THIS

15:48.781 --> 15:51.016
WAS TRULY ABSURD.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.084
BECAUSE RATHER THAN SIMPLY

15:52.084 --> 15:54.553
COLLECTING A DOLLAR FOR EVERY

15:54.553 --> 15:55.187
UNIT OF TERRA IT ISSUED-- WHICH

15:55.187 --> 15:56.855
WOULD MAKE SENSE-- IT INSTEAD

15:56.855 --> 15:58.223
TIED ITS VALUE TO A DIFFERENT

15:58.223 --> 15:59.458
COIN, LUNA, WHICH IT HAD ALSO

15:59.458 --> 16:06.899
MADE UP.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.499
AND IT SAID IT WOULD TURN LUNA

16:07.499 --> 16:08.500
INTO TERRA AND TERRA INTO LUNA,

16:08.500 --> 16:09.101
WITH A SPECIAL ALGORITHM.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.703
AND IF THAT SOUNDS BOTH

16:10.703 --> 16:11.303
COMPLICATED AND STUPID TO YOU,

16:11.303 --> 16:11.637
IT IS.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.671
HERE'S HOW THE COMPANY EXPLAINED

16:12.671 --> 16:14.340
IT-- AND JUST KNOW, YOU DON'T

16:14.340 --> 16:14.907
NEED TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING

16:14.907 --> 16:15.507
THAT'S HAPPENING HERE, BECAUSE

16:15.507 --> 16:17.009
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.277
LET'S IMAGINE THE ENTIRE

16:18.277 --> 16:20.546
TERRA ECONOMY AS A POOL.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.647
THE SIZE OF THE POOL IS

16:21.647 --> 16:23.349
DETERMINED BY THE TOTAL SUPPLY

16:23.349 --> 16:25.584
OF UST.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.953
IF MORE PEOPLE WANT UST, THE

16:27.953 --> 16:29.088
TIDE RISES, AND IF LESS PEOPLE

16:29.088 --> 16:31.690
WANT UST, THE TIDE FALLS.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.025
TO BRING BACK THE WATER LEVEL TO

16:33.025 --> 16:34.893
$1, WE CAN EXPAND THE POOL BY

16:34.893 --> 16:37.329
INTRODUCING A NEW SUPPLY OF UST.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.998
BUT WHERE DOES NEW UST COME

16:39.998 --> 16:42.101
FROM?

16:42.101 --> 16:44.403
AT TERRA, WE'VE DESIGNED A

16:44.403 --> 16:45.604
MACHINE THAT SWAPS $1 WORTH OF

16:45.604 --> 16:47.740
LUNA TO ONE UST.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.640
OKAY, IMAGINE IF

16:48.640 --> 16:50.442
SOMEONE CAME UP TO YOU WHILE YOU

16:50.442 --> 16:51.577
WERE AT THE ATM AND SAID, "GIVE

16:51.577 --> 16:53.011
ME THAT MONEY, AND INSTEAD, I'LL

16:53.011 --> 16:53.612
GIVE YOU BLORPS.

16:53.612 --> 16:56.048
ONE BLORP IS ALWAYS WORTH ONE

16:56.048 --> 16:56.949
DOLLAR, AND THE REASON I CAN

16:56.949 --> 16:58.250
GUARANTEE THAT IS, I'LL SELL AS

16:58.250 --> 16:59.451
MANY FLEEZLES AS IT TAKES TO

16:59.451 --> 17:00.753
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.521
ALSO, I MAKE THE FLEEZLES."

17:02.521 --> 17:04.523
YOU'D PROBABLY SAY NO WOULDN'T

17:04.523 --> 17:05.290
YOU IMMEDIATELY?

17:05.290 --> 17:06.992
BUT IF THEY THEN SAID "I DO IT

17:06.992 --> 17:08.394
WITH A SPECIAL ALGORITHM,"

17:08.394 --> 17:08.994
SUDDENLY, YOU MIGHT THINK THEY

17:08.994 --> 17:10.929
KNOW SOMETHING YOU DON'T.

17:10.929 --> 17:11.764
WELL, THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT

17:11.764 --> 17:12.998
HAPPENED HERE.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.100
AND TO BE FAIR, SOME PEOPLE DID

17:15.100 --> 17:16.335
SEE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.736
IN 2018, AN ANALYST LOOKED AT

17:17.736 --> 17:19.071
TERRA'S BUSINESS MODEL AND SAID,

17:19.071 --> 17:20.472
"THIS IS CRAZY.

17:20.472 --> 17:25.210
THIS OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T WORK."

17:25.210 --> 17:26.578
AND KWON WOULD SHAME ANYONE WHO

17:26.578 --> 17:27.579
DARED QUESTION HIS MODEL.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.349
AFTER A FINANCIAL WRITER RAISED

17:30.349 --> 17:30.883
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

17:30.883 --> 17:33.585
VULNERABILITIES OF CRYPTO, KWON

17:33.585 --> 17:35.187
TWEETED, "I DON'T DEBATE THE

17:35.187 --> 17:35.587
POOR ON TWITTER."

17:35.587 --> 17:36.221
AND FOR A WHILE, HIS CONFIDENCE

17:36.221 --> 17:36.922
WORKED.

17:36.922 --> 17:37.923
AT ITS HEIGHT, LUNA'S TOTAL

17:37.923 --> 17:39.425
VALUE BALLOONED TO MORE THAN $40

17:39.425 --> 17:40.926
BILLION DOLLARS.

17:40.926 --> 17:41.994
THE WASHINGTON NATIONALS ENTERED

17:41.994 --> 17:43.595
A PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM, KWON'S

17:43.595 --> 17:45.197
FOLLOWERS CALLED THEMSELVES

17:45.197 --> 17:47.666
LUNATICS, AND ONE OF HIS BACKERS

17:47.666 --> 17:49.334
EVEN GOT A LUNA-THEMED TATTOO.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.170
AND THAT'S A BOLD MOVE FROM

17:51.170 --> 17:53.405
CRYPTO MOBY THERE.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.441
I'D SAY IT'S THE WORST TATTOO

17:55.441 --> 17:57.509
I'VE EVER SEEN, BUT I HAVE SEEN

17:57.509 --> 17:58.844
THIS TATTOO OF R. KELLY WITH THE

17:58.844 --> 18:00.179
WORDS, "I DON'T SEE NOTHING

18:00.179 --> 18:03.182
WRONG," AND THAT'S AROUND FIVE

18:03.182 --> 18:04.917
PERCENT WORSE.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.552
BUT WE NOW KNOW, ACCORDING TO

18:06.552 --> 18:08.687
THE SEC, THE ALGORITHM DIDN'T

18:08.687 --> 18:11.323
WORK AS THEY'D CLAIMED.

18:11.323 --> 18:11.957
IN FACT, AT ONE POINT IN 2021,

18:11.957 --> 18:13.425
TERRA NEARLY COLLAPSED.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.327
AND WHILE KWON TOLD PEOPLE THE

18:15.327 --> 18:16.862
CRISIS HAD BEEN AVERTED THANKS

18:16.862 --> 18:18.497
TO HIS ALGORITHM, SAYING IT WAS

18:18.497 --> 18:20.432
"AUTOMATICALLY SELF-HEALING."

18:20.432 --> 18:21.099
IT TURNS OUT, IT WAS ONLY SAVED

18:21.099 --> 18:22.801
BY THE DELIBERATE INTERVENTION

18:22.801 --> 18:24.169
OF A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WAS

18:24.169 --> 18:25.804
QUIETLY PURCHASING LARGE

18:25.804 --> 18:27.773
QUANTITIES OF TERRA TO RESTORE

18:27.773 --> 18:29.274
ITS VALUE.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.243
BUT LAST MAY, A FEW BIG TRADES

18:31.243 --> 18:33.011
DESTABILIZED THE PRICE OF TERRA,

18:33.011 --> 18:35.013
PROMPTING A PANIC IN WHICH BOTH

18:35.013 --> 18:36.648
TERRA AND LUNA HOLDERS STARTED

18:36.648 --> 18:37.349
SELLING EN MASSE.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.751
AND SINCE THEY WEREN'T BACKED BY

18:39.751 --> 18:41.119
ANYTHING BUT GOOD VIBES, BOTH

18:41.119 --> 18:42.554
COINS' VALUE WERE TRADING AT

18:42.554 --> 18:44.323
ESSENTIALLY ZERO, AND THE

18:44.323 --> 18:46.391
IMPLOSION ERASED TENS OF

18:46.391 --> 18:47.960
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF VALUE.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.894
AS FOR KWON, HE NOW FACES

18:48.894 --> 18:50.629
CHARGES IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.364
AND HE ACTUALLY WENT ON THE RUN

18:52.364 --> 18:53.298
FOR A BIT, BUT BEFORE HE WAS

18:53.298 --> 18:56.301
CAUGHT, MANAGED TO FIND

18:56.301 --> 18:58.504
SOME EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ON A

18:58.504 --> 18:59.004
CRYPTO PODCAST.

18:59.004 --> 18:59.638
HERE HE IS, MID-THOUGHT, GETTING

18:59.638 --> 19:00.305
SURPRISED BY AN UNEXPECTED

19:00.305 --> 19:03.041
GUEST.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.643
YOU'RE, LIKE, YOU HAVEN'T

19:04.643 --> 19:07.579
SLEPT IN A WHILE AND LIKE, YOU

19:07.579 --> 19:10.482
FEEL ALMOST-- HOLY SHIT, IS

19:10.482 --> 19:11.783
THAT MARTIN SHKRELI?

19:11.783 --> 19:12.518
HEY, DO, I JUST WANTED TO LET

19:12.518 --> 19:14.653
YOU KNOW, JAIL'S NOT THAT BAD.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.188
IT'S-- IT SUCKS, BUT IT'S--

19:16.188 --> 19:18.090
IT'S NOT THE WORST THING EVER.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.625
YOU KNOW, SO DON'T-- DON'T

19:19.625 --> 19:20.993
FRET, IF THAT-- I HOPE IT

19:20.993 --> 19:21.960
DOE-- DOESN'T HAPPEN.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.161
BUT IF IT DOES HAPPEN, IT'S--

19:23.161 --> 19:24.396
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

19:24.396 --> 19:25.597
GOOD TO KNOW.

19:25.597 --> 19:27.399
WOW.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.034
I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN

19:29.034 --> 19:30.102
A MORE CURSED ZOOM CALL.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.371
AND I'M INCLUDING THAT CELEBRITY

19:32.371 --> 19:34.306
"IMAGINE" VIDEO.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.474
AND, QUICK SIDENOTE, IF YOU'RE

19:35.474 --> 19:37.109
WONDERING IF JIM CRAMER EVER SAW

19:37.109 --> 19:39.111
MARTIN SHKRELI'S SCANDAL COMING,

19:39.111 --> 19:43.949
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT SHKRELI

19:43.949 --> 19:44.483
ACTUALLY GOT HIS START AT

19:44.483 --> 19:44.983
JIM CRAMER'S HEDGEFUND.

19:44.983 --> 19:45.617
SO, ANOTHER ACE IN THE HOLE FOR

19:45.617 --> 19:46.952
THE CRAME-GAME.

19:46.952 --> 19:47.753
BUT IT'S NOT JUST

19:47.753 --> 19:49.321
CRYPTOCURRENCIES THAT CAN BE

19:49.321 --> 19:49.655
BUILT ON SAND.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.289
THE SAME CAN HAPPEN WITH CRYPTO

19:50.289 --> 19:50.622
"BANKS."

19:50.622 --> 19:51.323
WHICH ARE ALREADY A BIT OF A

19:51.323 --> 19:53.926
MISNOMER.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.494
BECAUSE UNLIKE TRADITIONAL

19:55.494 --> 19:56.728
BANKS, THEY'RE NOT REGULATED OR,

19:56.728 --> 19:57.563
INDEED, INSURED.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.864
BUT THEY'RE FIRMS THAT'LL HOLD

19:58.864 --> 19:59.965
YOUR CRYPTO, PAY YOU INTEREST,

19:59.965 --> 20:01.266
AND LEND IT OUT.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.201
AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR SECOND

20:03.201 --> 20:05.137
CELSIUS, ONE OF THE

20:05.137 --> 20:06.872
BIGGEST CRYPTO BANKS, FOUNDED BY

20:06.872 --> 20:08.540
THIS GUY, ALEX MASHINSKY.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.108
NOW HIS WHOLE SALES PITCH, AS

20:10.108 --> 20:11.843
YOU CAN SEE FROM HIS COOL

20:11.843 --> 20:12.744
T-SHIRT, WAS "BANKS ARE NOT YOUR

20:12.744 --> 20:13.946
FRIENDS."

20:13.946 --> 20:15.314
WHICH IS CLEARLY TRUE.

20:15.314 --> 20:18.317
BUT HE REALLY DOUBLED DOWN, IN

20:18.317 --> 20:19.451
ADS LIKE THIS.

20:19.451 --> 20:20.986
BANKS ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS.

20:20.986 --> 20:21.853
WE ALL KNOW THAT.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.555
AND WE DECIDED TO CREATE A

20:23.555 --> 20:24.890
REPLACEMENT FOR THE BANKING

20:24.890 --> 20:25.924
SYSTEM, RIGHT?

20:25.924 --> 20:26.558
SOMETHING THAT ACTS IN YOUR BEST

20:26.558 --> 20:27.526
INTEREST.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.628
A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY

20:29.628 --> 20:30.329
HAVE YOUR MONEY WORK FOR YOU.

20:30.329 --> 20:31.430
NOT JUST YOU WORK FOR YOUR

20:31.430 --> 20:32.331
MONEY.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.031
AND BASICALLY, THREE YEARS SINCE

20:33.031 --> 20:35.100
WE LAUNCHED THE PRODUCT, WE'VE

20:35.100 --> 20:35.701
PAID A BILLION DOLLARS BACK TO

20:35.701 --> 20:37.235
THE COMMUNITY.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.236
NOW, DESPITE THE FACT

20:38.236 --> 20:39.471
HE SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE

20:39.471 --> 20:40.973
TOMMY WISEAU IN "THE ROOM,"

20:40.973 --> 20:42.541
MASHINSKY BUILT ONE OF THE

20:42.541 --> 20:43.909
BIGGEST CRYPTO LENDERS WITH MORE

20:43.909 --> 20:46.545
THAN $12 BILLION IN DEPOSITS.

20:46.545 --> 20:47.913
AND ONE OF THE WAYS HE DID THIS

20:47.913 --> 20:49.414
WAS BY PROMISING CUSTOMERS WOULD

20:49.414 --> 20:52.451
GET UP TO 18% INTEREST RATES ON

20:52.451 --> 20:53.352
THEIR DEPOSITS, VERSUS THE

20:53.352 --> 20:55.887
AVERAGE OF .06% THEN BEING

20:55.887 --> 20:58.590
OFFERED BY TRADITIONAL BANKS.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.458
AND HE LIKED TO SAY THAT BANKS

20:59.458 --> 21:00.993
COULD ACTUALLY PAY THOSE SORTS

21:00.993 --> 21:03.028
OF RATES IF THEY WANTED TO,

21:03.028 --> 21:04.796
ADDING, "SOMEBODY IS LYING.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.131
EITHER THE BANK IS LYING OR

21:06.131 --> 21:07.165
CELSIUS IS LYING."

21:07.165 --> 21:08.600
AND HEY, PORQUE NO LOS DOS?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.636
TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE!

21:10.636 --> 21:15.641
LIKE HOW FRANKIE MUNIZ CAN BE

21:15.641 --> 21:16.608
BOTH 37-YEARS-OLD AND 12 AT THE

21:16.608 --> 21:17.209
SAME TIME, OR HOW THE ROCK CAN

21:17.209 --> 21:17.776
BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PAID

21:17.776 --> 21:18.844
ACTORS IN HOLLYWOOD DESPITE

21:18.844 --> 21:20.445
NEVER ACTUALLY ACTING.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.214
MASHINSKY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO

21:22.214 --> 21:23.749
BUILD TRUST AMONG CUSTOMERS,

21:23.749 --> 21:25.917
HOLDING WEEKLY LIVESTREAM AMAS,

21:25.917 --> 21:27.252
SOMETIMES FEATURING DUMB STUNTS,

21:27.252 --> 21:30.789
LIKE WHEN HE STARTED ONE WEARING

21:30.789 --> 21:31.657
A MANDOLORIAN MASK.

21:31.657 --> 21:32.290
AND ON THESE CALLS, HE'D BRAG

21:32.290 --> 21:32.991
ABOUT ALL THE GREAT THINGS HIS

21:32.991 --> 21:34.559
COMPANY WAS DOING FOR PEOPLE,

21:34.559 --> 21:35.627
WHILE OCCASIONALLY ENGAGING IN

21:35.627 --> 21:38.830
THE WORST ATTEMPT AT A DAB I'VE

21:38.830 --> 21:40.198
EVER SEEN.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.967
THE BEAUTY OF WHAT CELSIUS

21:41.967 --> 21:43.235
MANAGED TO DO IS THAT WE DELIVER

21:43.235 --> 21:45.103
YIELD, WE PAY IT TO THE PEOPLE

21:45.103 --> 21:46.738
WHO WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT

21:46.738 --> 21:53.478
THEMSELVES, WE TAKE IT FROM THE

21:53.478 --> 21:54.046
RICH, AND WE BEAT THE INDEX.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.547
THAT'S LIKE GOING TO THE

21:55.547 --> 21:56.181
OLYMPICS AND GETTING 15 MEDALS

21:56.181 --> 21:56.748
IN 15 DIFFERENT FIELDS.

21:56.748 --> 22:02.054
OKAY?

22:02.054 --> 22:02.688
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

22:02.688 --> 22:03.588
A HEADS-UP DAB?

22:03.588 --> 22:04.489
AND TO BE HONEST, WHY A DAB AT

22:04.489 --> 22:07.659
ALL?

22:07.659 --> 22:08.960
IT'S NOT 2015 AND YOU'RE NOT A

22:08.960 --> 22:09.361
GUEST ON "ELLEN."

22:09.361 --> 22:11.263
ALSO, YOU'RE 57 YEARS OLD!

22:11.263 --> 22:12.164
THAT DEMONSTRATES A LACK OF

22:12.164 --> 22:13.432
JUDGMENT FRANKLY TERRIFYING IN

22:13.432 --> 22:14.032
SOMEONE SUPPOSEDLY RUNNING A

22:14.032 --> 22:19.905
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.

22:19.905 --> 22:20.539
AND YET, MASHINSKY INSISTED "WE

22:20.539 --> 22:21.139
ARE PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEAST

22:21.139 --> 22:22.674
RISKY BUSINESSES THAT REGULATORS

22:22.674 --> 22:23.775
WORLDWIDE HAVE EVER SEEN."

22:23.775 --> 22:27.012
WHICH WAS FLAGRANTLY UNTRUE.

22:27.012 --> 22:27.979
A COURT-APPOINTED EXAMINER LATER

22:27.979 --> 22:29.781
FOUND HE WAS MAKING INCREDIBLY

22:29.781 --> 22:31.516
RISKY LOANS, AND WAS ALSO USING

22:31.516 --> 22:33.618
CUSTOMERS' MONEY TO PAY THE HIGH

22:33.618 --> 22:34.886
YIELDS THAT HE'D PROMISED.

22:34.886 --> 22:35.721
WHICH SURE SOUNDS LIKE THE

22:35.721 --> 22:37.089
TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF A PONZI

22:37.089 --> 22:39.291
SCHEME.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.292
EVENTUALLY, CELSIUS STARTED

22:40.292 --> 22:42.327
MINTING ITS OWN COIN TO INFLATE

22:42.327 --> 22:43.428
ITS BALANCE SHEET-- A COIN ITS

22:43.428 --> 22:44.896
OWN EMPLOYEES SAID WAS

22:44.896 --> 22:47.265
"WORTHLESS" AND THAT ITS PRICE

22:47.265 --> 22:48.567
"SHOULD BE ZERO."

22:48.567 --> 22:50.168
ONE EVEN SAID THAT THE WHOLE

22:50.168 --> 22:51.470
THING WAS "VERY PONZI LIKE," AND

22:51.470 --> 22:52.771
AT ONE POINT, THE COMPANY'S

22:52.771 --> 22:53.972
FORMER FINANCE CHIEF SAID, "WE

22:53.972 --> 22:55.173
ARE DOING SOMETHING POSSIBLY

22:55.173 --> 22:56.708
ILLEGAL AND DEFINITELY NOT

22:56.708 --> 22:59.311
COMPLIANT."

22:59.311 --> 23:00.445
AND WHAT AN OFFICE THAT MUST'VE

23:00.445 --> 23:01.346
BEEN TO WORK IN.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.281
FINDING YOURSELF WANDERING OVER

23:03.281 --> 23:04.049
TO SHERYL'S DESK LIKE, "HEY

23:04.049 --> 23:04.983
GIRL, GREAT TOP!

23:04.983 --> 23:07.886
QUICK Q, ARE WE LIKE DOING

23:07.886 --> 23:10.188
CRIMES?

23:10.188 --> 23:11.723
CAUSE I'M GETTING LIKE MAJOR

23:11.723 --> 23:13.225
CRIME VIBES IN HERE.

23:13.225 --> 23:13.792
ALSO, HAVE YOU SEEN OUR BOSS

23:13.792 --> 23:20.599
DAB?

23:20.599 --> 23:21.433
IT'S VERY WEIRD!"

23:21.433 --> 23:22.000
AND WHEN CELSIUS INEVITABLY

23:22.000 --> 23:22.968
COLLAPSED, PEOPLE GOT HURT.

23:22.968 --> 23:26.938
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE, IN THE FINE

23:26.938 --> 23:27.539
PRINT, THE COMPANY'S TERMS OF

23:27.539 --> 23:28.940
USE STATED THAT CUSTOMERS

23:28.940 --> 23:29.474
TRANSFERRED ALL "RIGHTS OF

23:29.474 --> 23:30.408
OWNERSHIP" IN THEIR CRYPTO

23:30.408 --> 23:32.511
ASSETS BY DEPOSITING THEM IN A

23:32.511 --> 23:32.878
CELSIUS ACCOUNT.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.880
MEANING THAT WHEN PEOPLE TRIED

23:34.880 --> 23:35.480
TO WITHDRAW THEIR MONEY, THEY

23:35.480 --> 23:36.882
FOUND OUT IT LEGALLY WASN'T

23:36.882 --> 23:38.183
THEIRS ANYMORE.

23:38.183 --> 23:39.518
AND WHILE CELSIUS AND MASHINSKY

23:39.518 --> 23:40.619
HAVE NOT BEEN CRIMINALLY

23:40.619 --> 23:42.487
CHARGED, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

23:42.487 --> 23:43.355
CUSTOMERS STILL HAVE DIGITAL

23:43.355 --> 23:44.956
ASSETS TRAPPED ON THE PLATFORM.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.058
AND CELSIUS HAS REPORTED THAT IT

23:47.058 --> 23:49.895
OWES THEM $4.7 BILLION DOLLARS.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.329
ALL OF WHICH IS ENOUGH TO MAKE

23:51.329 --> 23:52.931
YOU THINK THAT, WHILE "BANKS ARE

23:52.931 --> 23:54.266
NOT YOUR FRIENDS," THIS GUY MAY

23:54.266 --> 23:56.935
ACTUALLY BE YOUR ENEMY.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.503
SO, SO WE'VE GOT BULLSHIT MONEY,

23:58.503 --> 23:59.604
AND A BULLSHIT BANK.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.939
WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO

24:00.939 --> 24:03.108
SAM BANKMAN FRIED AND FTX.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.442
IT WAS BASICALLY A WHOLE

24:04.442 --> 24:05.744
BULLSHIT TRADING PLATFORM.

24:05.744 --> 24:08.046
THE PITCH WAS THAT FTX WAS AN

24:08.046 --> 24:09.481
EXCHANGE WHERE YOU COULD BUY AND

24:09.481 --> 24:11.716
SELL CRYPTOCURRENCIES JUST LIKE

24:11.716 --> 24:12.984
STOCKS, AND ITS EASE WAS

24:12.984 --> 24:14.019
EMPHASIZED IN ADS-- LIKE THIS

24:14.019 --> 24:15.287
ONE WITH STEPH CURRY-- THAT

24:15.287 --> 24:16.555
PLAY, IN HINDSIGHT, LIKE A BIT

24:16.555 --> 24:18.256
OF A RED FLAG.

24:18.256 --> 24:19.558
THIS IS STEPH CURRY.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.193
THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT ON

24:21.193 --> 24:22.627
CRYPTOCURRENCIES.

24:22.627 --> 24:23.562
I'M NOT.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.363
OKAY, QUICK MESSING AROUND,

24:25.363 --> 24:26.531
MAN, GIVE ME SOME TIPS ON

24:26.531 --> 24:26.765
CRYPTO.

24:26.765 --> 24:27.799
NO.

24:27.799 --> 24:28.466
BUT YOU ARE AN EXPERT, RIGHT?

24:28.466 --> 24:31.670
NO.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.270
I'M NOT AN EXPERT AND I DON'T

24:32.270 --> 24:35.707
NEED TO BE, WITH FTX APP,

24:35.707 --> 24:38.777
I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED TO BUY,

24:38.777 --> 24:39.511
SELL, AND TRADE CRYPTO SAFELY.

24:39.511 --> 24:40.145
YEAH, "YOU DON'T EVEN

24:40.145 --> 24:40.779
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT, JUST USE

24:40.779 --> 24:40.946
IT."

24:40.946 --> 24:41.880
THEIR PITCH FOR A MAJOR MONEY

24:41.880 --> 24:42.781
APP WAS BASICALLY THE SAME AS

24:42.781 --> 24:44.449
THE ATTITUDE WE ALL HAVE TOWARDS

24:44.449 --> 24:45.350
SEMI-COLONS.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.952
YOU'RE NEVER 100% USING ONE OF

24:46.952 --> 24:48.987
THOSE.

24:48.987 --> 24:49.988
IT'S A REAL "GO WITH GOD"

24:49.988 --> 24:51.723
PUNCTUATION.

24:51.723 --> 24:52.691
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, IT KIND OF

24:52.691 --> 24:53.992
MAKES SENSE THEY'D GET

24:53.992 --> 24:55.994
STEPH CURRY FOR THAT CONSIDERING

24:55.994 --> 24:57.095
HE'S ALREADY A SPOKESPERSON FOR

24:57.095 --> 24:58.129
SUBWAY, A RESTAURANT WHOSE

24:58.129 --> 25:00.098
SLOGAN IS OFFICIALLY "EAT FRESH"

25:00.098 --> 25:00.732
BUT SPIRITUALLY "TRUST US, IT'S

25:00.732 --> 25:03.702
TUNA."

25:03.702 --> 25:05.103
AND, AGAIN, FOR A WHILE, THAT

25:05.103 --> 25:06.638
PITCH WORKED PRETTY WELL.

25:06.638 --> 25:08.473
FTX HELD A CONFERENCE IN THE

25:08.473 --> 25:09.941
BAHAMAS LESS THAN A YEAR AGO

25:09.941 --> 25:11.109
THAT INCLUDED A PANEL WITH

25:11.109 --> 25:12.911
TONY BLAIR AND BILL CLINTON, AND

25:12.911 --> 25:14.379
APPEARANCES BY ORLANDO BLOOM,

25:14.379 --> 25:15.714
AND KATY PERRY.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.949
TOM BRADY WAS EVEN THERE, TOO,

25:17.949 --> 25:19.718
MAKING VIDEOS LIKE THIS.

25:19.718 --> 25:20.685
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

25:20.685 --> 25:21.286
I'M HERE WITH MY BOY SAM FROM

25:21.286 --> 25:23.255
FTX.

25:23.255 --> 25:23.755
WE'RE AT CRYPTO BAHAMAS

25:23.755 --> 25:25.223
CONFERENCE, WE'RE GOING TO START

25:25.223 --> 25:26.825
THE DAY, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME

25:26.825 --> 25:28.526
TIKTOKS FOR YOU GUYS, AND IT'S

25:28.526 --> 25:29.961
GONNA BE AN AMAZING DAY, WE'RE

25:29.961 --> 25:32.163
GONNA GET STARTED, WE'LL DO A

25:32.163 --> 25:35.300
GET READY WITH ME-- SAM, WHERE

25:35.300 --> 25:36.001
ARE YOU GOING, BRO?

25:36.001 --> 25:37.969
LOOK, SAM, SAM, FROM

25:37.969 --> 25:39.938
NEVER

25:39.938 --> 25:41.940
STAND THAT CLOSE TO TOM BRADY.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.341
IT IS DOING YOU NO FAVORS.

25:43.341 --> 25:44.676
THERE'S A REASON I'VE NEVER BEEN

25:44.676 --> 25:45.744
PHOTOGRAPHED WITH

25:45.744 --> 25:46.444
CHRIS HEMSWORTH, NO MATTER HOW

25:46.444 --> 25:48.980
MUCH HE BEGS FOR IT.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.216
NOW, THE JOKE THERE WAS THAT SAM

25:51.216 --> 25:52.651
WAS A SHY, SELF-EFFACING GENIUS.

25:52.651 --> 25:54.519
AND THAT'S THE GENERAL VIBE HE

25:54.519 --> 25:56.521
WENT FOR.

25:56.521 --> 25:57.122
IT'S WHY HE DRESSED LIKE EVERY

25:57.122 --> 25:58.290
DAY WAS LAUNDRY DAY AND COMBED

25:58.290 --> 26:00.191
HIS HAIR WITH A BALLOON.

26:00.191 --> 26:02.460
OBVIOUSLY, WE NOW KNOW THAT

26:02.460 --> 26:04.162
THINGS CAME CRASHING DOWN, BUT

26:04.162 --> 26:04.729
EVEN AFTER THEY DID, SBF WAS

26:04.729 --> 26:06.298
STILL DEFENSIVE ABOUT WHAT HE

26:06.298 --> 26:06.564
HAD BUILT.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.400
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU

26:08.400 --> 26:08.867
AND SEE BERNIE MADOFF.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.936
YEAH.

26:10.936 --> 26:15.140
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHO

26:15.140 --> 26:16.474
I AM AT-- AT ALL, BUT I

26:16.474 --> 26:17.909
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE SAYING

26:17.909 --> 26:18.910
THAT.

26:18.910 --> 26:19.311
PEOPLE LOST MONEY.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.079
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLASSIC

26:21.079 --> 26:21.913
BERNIE MADOFF STORY, THERE WAS

26:21.913 --> 26:24.683
NO REAL BUSINESS THERE.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.952
THE WHOLE THING, AS I UNDERSTAND

26:26.952 --> 26:27.886
IT, I THINK, WAS-- WAS JUST

26:27.886 --> 26:29.955
ONE-- ONE BIG PONZI SCHEME,

26:29.955 --> 26:31.089
RIGHT?

26:31.089 --> 26:34.559
FTX, THAT WAS A REAL BUSINESS.

26:34.559 --> 26:35.527
YEAH, BUT WAS IT

26:35.527 --> 26:36.761
THOUGH?

26:36.761 --> 26:38.496
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT NO ONE

26:38.496 --> 26:40.665
WANTS TO ADMIT THEIR BUSINESS

26:40.665 --> 26:42.500
WAS A SCAM, IT'S THE SAME REASON

26:42.500 --> 26:43.134
NO PARENT WANTS TO ADMIT THEIR

26:43.134 --> 26:43.635
CHILD SUCKS.

26:43.635 --> 26:44.703
SAYING IT OUT LOUD MAKES IT

26:44.703 --> 26:46.071
REAL.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.539
BUT THE TRUTH IS SOME KIDS DO.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.174
SOME KIDS ARE JUST, TO PUT IT

26:49.174 --> 26:52.077
NICELY, "NOT A FUN HANG."

26:52.077 --> 26:53.211
YOU STILL LOVE THEM, OF COURSE,

26:53.211 --> 26:54.579
BUT DO YOU LIKE THEM?

26:54.579 --> 26:56.648
EXACTLY.

26:56.648 --> 26:57.983
BUT IT'S WORTH UNDERSTANDING

26:57.983 --> 26:59.584
JUST WHAT SBF'S "REAL BUSINESS"

26:59.584 --> 27:00.852
CONSISTED OF.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.020
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT, IN

27:02.020 --> 27:03.388
ADDITION TO FTX, HE HAD A HEDGE

27:03.388 --> 27:05.090
FUND CALLED ALAMEDA, AND ALSO

27:05.090 --> 27:07.192
PRODUCED HIS OWN COIN, BECAUSE

27:07.192 --> 27:09.494
OF COURSE HE DID, CALLED FTT.

27:09.494 --> 27:11.563
AND VERY BASICALLY, ACCORDING TO

27:11.563 --> 27:12.998
AUTHORITIES, WHAT HE DID WAS

27:12.998 --> 27:14.299
FILLED UP HIS HEDGE FUND'S BOOKS

27:14.299 --> 27:16.034
WITH THE COIN THAT HE PRODUCED,

27:16.034 --> 27:17.502
USING HIS EXCHANGE TO INFLATE

27:17.502 --> 27:18.536
THAT COIN'S PRICE.

27:18.536 --> 27:19.971
AND ONCE HIS HEDGE FUND HAD A

27:19.971 --> 27:21.206
GIANT STASH OF HIS OWN COIN, IT

27:21.206 --> 27:22.941
USED THAT AS COLLATERAL TO TAKE

27:22.941 --> 27:24.109
OUT SEVERAL LOANS.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.211
ESSENTIALLY, THE FEDS SAY HE

27:26.211 --> 27:27.712
CREATED FAKE MONEY, INFLATED ITS

27:27.712 --> 27:29.381
PRICE, AND THEN BORROWED REAL

27:29.381 --> 27:30.782
MONEY AGAINST THAT.

27:30.782 --> 27:31.850
BUT WAIT, I'M NOT DONE.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.151
BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO TAKING MONEY

27:33.151 --> 27:34.853
FROM ACTUAL FTX CUSTOMERS-- THE

27:34.853 --> 27:36.221
ONES, REMEMBER, WHO WERE PUTTING

27:36.221 --> 27:39.257
MONEY IN FTX BECAUSE STEPH CURRY

27:39.257 --> 27:40.025
TOLD THEM IT WAS SAFE-- AND

27:40.025 --> 27:41.826
THEN LOANING IT BACK TO HIS

27:41.826 --> 27:43.094
HEDGE FUND.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.396
THE WHOLE THING WAS HONESTLY

27:44.396 --> 27:45.430
PRETTY BLATANT.

27:45.430 --> 27:46.965
AFTER EVERYTHING COLLAPSED, A

27:46.965 --> 27:48.566
NEW CEO CAME IN TO HANDLE THE

27:48.566 --> 27:49.367
BANKRUPTCY, AND AS HE TOLD

27:49.367 --> 27:51.102
CONGRESS, HE WAS SHOCKED AT HOW

27:51.102 --> 27:52.904
SLOPPY AND POORLY RUN EVERYTHING

27:52.904 --> 27:54.873
WAS.

27:54.873 --> 27:55.940
THIS IS REALLY OLD-FASHIONED

27:55.940 --> 27:57.709
EMBEZZLEMENT.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.310
THIS IS JUST TAKING MONEY FROM

27:59.310 --> 28:01.780
CUSTOMERS AND USING IT FOR YOUR

28:01.780 --> 28:04.049
OWN PURPOSE.

28:04.049 --> 28:06.351
NOT SOPHISTICATED AT ALL.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.685
LITERALLY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S

28:07.685 --> 28:08.987
NO RECORD KEEPING WHATSOEVER.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.688
THEY USED QUICKBOOKS, A

28:10.688 --> 28:11.389
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY

28:11.389 --> 28:12.123
USING QUICKBOOKS.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.091
QUICKBOOKS?

28:13.091 --> 28:14.692
QUICKBOOKS.

28:14.692 --> 28:15.527
IT'S TRUE, THEY USED

28:15.527 --> 28:16.895
QUICKBOOKS.

28:16.895 --> 28:18.096
AND LOOK, I'M NO ACCOUNTANT.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.397
I MEAN, I SHOULD BE.

28:19.397 --> 28:20.498
I LOOK LIKE MY MOST FORMATIVE

28:20.498 --> 28:22.067
CHILDHOOD MEMORIES WERE IN AN

28:22.067 --> 28:22.967
H&R BLOCK.

28:22.967 --> 28:24.169
I LOOK LIKE I FELL INTO A VAT OF

28:24.169 --> 28:26.104
RADIOACTIVE ITEMIZED RECEIPTS.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.006
I LOOK LIKE WHAT APPEARS IF YOU

28:28.006 --> 28:28.907
SAY "MICROSOFT EXCEL" INTO THE

28:28.907 --> 28:30.208
MIRROR THREE TIMES.

28:30.208 --> 28:30.708
BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT AN

28:30.708 --> 28:31.709
ACCOUNTANT.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.445
AND YET, EVEN I KNOW THAT USING

28:33.445 --> 28:34.913
"QUICKBOOKS" FOR A COMPANY OF

28:34.913 --> 28:36.548
THAT SIZE IS ABSURD.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.949
THAT MAN ALSO REVEALED THAT FTX

28:37.949 --> 28:39.451
LET THOUSANDS OF UNCASHED

28:39.451 --> 28:41.152
DEPOSIT CHECKS SIT AROUND LIKE

28:41.152 --> 28:42.554
"JUNK MAIL" AND APPROVED

28:42.554 --> 28:44.956
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF EXPENSE

28:44.956 --> 28:46.724
REPORTS VIA EMOJI ON SLACK.

28:46.724 --> 28:48.726
AND I'M DYING TO KNOW WHICH

28:48.726 --> 28:49.694
EMOJI THEY USED.

28:49.694 --> 28:51.296
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW, EMOJIS ON

28:51.296 --> 28:52.630
SLACK HAVE VERY SPECIFIC

28:52.630 --> 28:53.798
MEANINGS.

28:53.798 --> 28:54.833
FOR INSTANCE THUMBS UP MEANS

28:54.833 --> 28:55.733
"I'M DONE WITH THIS

28:55.733 --> 28:56.935
CONVERSATION."

28:56.935 --> 28:58.503
THIS MEANS "I'M TOO LAZY TO TYPE

28:58.503 --> 28:59.938
THANK YOU."

28:59.938 --> 29:00.705
THIS MEANS "I'M DYING INSIDE,

29:00.705 --> 29:02.407
DON'T TALK TO ME."

29:02.407 --> 29:03.741
THIS MEANS "FEELING CHEEKY,

29:03.741 --> 29:04.442
LET'S GOSS."

29:04.442 --> 29:05.944
AND THIS ONE MEANS "LOOK AT ME,

29:05.944 --> 29:08.646
I'MMA ITALIAN."

29:08.646 --> 29:10.181
BUT I'VE YET TO DISCOVER WHICH

29:10.181 --> 29:10.915
EMOJI MEANS "GO AHEAD.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.150
SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

29:12.150 --> 29:13.585
COMPANY FUNDS."

29:13.585 --> 29:14.452
BUT IF I HAD TO GUESS, I'D SAY

29:14.452 --> 29:16.521
IT'S PROBABLY MONEY BARF.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.356
BUT IT'S NO WONDER THAT NEW CEO

29:18.356 --> 29:20.859
HAS SAID, "NEVER IN MY CAREER

29:20.859 --> 29:21.426
HAVE I SEEN SUCH A COMPLETE

29:21.426 --> 29:23.128
FAILURE OF CORPORATE CONTROLS

29:23.128 --> 29:24.896
AND SUCH A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF

29:24.896 --> 29:26.397
TRUSTWORTHY FINANCIAL

29:26.397 --> 29:28.199
INFORMATION AS OCCURRED HERE."

29:28.199 --> 29:30.568
WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING, GIVEN

29:30.568 --> 29:32.370
HIS CAREER INCLUDES "OVERSEEING

29:32.370 --> 29:34.606
THE BANKRUPTCY OF ENRON."

29:34.606 --> 29:36.141
AND IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER HOW

29:36.141 --> 29:37.442
BAD ENRON WAS, GOOGLE IT, I

29:37.442 --> 29:40.078
CAN'T DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU.

29:40.078 --> 29:40.645
SUFFICE IT TO SAY, IT'S VERY

29:40.645 --> 29:42.780
BAD.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.048
THE THROUGHLINE IN ALL THREE

29:44.048 --> 29:45.083
COMPANIES I'VE TALKED ABOUT

29:45.083 --> 29:46.417
TONIGHT IS THEM CONFIDENTLY

29:46.417 --> 29:47.952
PRESENTING A VENEER OF

29:47.952 --> 29:49.187
EXPERTISE, EVEN AS, BENEATH THE

29:49.187 --> 29:49.787
SURFACE, THEY WERE A COMPLETE

29:49.787 --> 29:51.990
SHIT SHOW.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.124
AND IT KIND OF SAYS SOMETHING

29:53.124 --> 29:54.292
THAT, EVEN AS THEY IMPLODED, ALL

29:54.292 --> 29:56.194
THREE OF THE MEN BEHIND THEM

29:56.194 --> 29:57.328
WERE STILL TRYING TO BLUSTER

29:57.328 --> 29:59.464
THEIR WAY OUT OF IT.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.498
THAT INTERVIEW WHERE SBF

30:00.498 --> 30:02.700
INSISTED HIS COMPANY WAS A REAL

30:02.700 --> 30:04.068
BUSINESS CAME AFTER IT HAD

30:04.068 --> 30:05.837
DECLARED CHAPTER 11.

30:05.837 --> 30:06.971
AS FOR DO KWON, HE SPENT TIME

30:06.971 --> 30:09.207
PUSHING A NEW TERRA 2.0 COIN,

30:09.207 --> 30:10.542
AND WAS FINALLY ARRESTED LAST

30:10.542 --> 30:11.910
MONTH, AFTER A LENGTHY PURSUIT,

30:11.910 --> 30:13.077
INCLUDING AT ONE POINT HIM

30:13.077 --> 30:15.046
TWEETING THAT HE WASN'T "ON THE

30:15.046 --> 30:16.447
RUN" FROM SOUTH KOREAN

30:16.447 --> 30:17.782
AUTHORITIES, TO WHICH THEY

30:17.782 --> 30:18.850
RESPONDED THAT HE WAS "OBVIOUSLY

30:18.850 --> 30:21.452
ON THE RUN."

30:21.452 --> 30:22.854
AND AS FOR MASHINSKY, HERE IS

30:22.854 --> 30:24.155
AUDIO OF HIM TRYING TO BUCK UP

30:24.155 --> 30:25.256
HIS TEAM AT AN ALL-HANDS

30:25.256 --> 30:25.924
MEETING, EVEN AS HIS COMPANY WAS

30:25.924 --> 30:31.095
CRUMBLING AROUND HIM.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.163
WELL, PEPSI FILED FOR

30:32.163 --> 30:35.900
BANKRUPTCY TWICE, RIGHT?

30:35.900 --> 30:36.467
DOES IT MAKE THE PEPSI TASTE

30:36.467 --> 30:40.338
LESS GOOD, RIGHT?

30:40.338 --> 30:40.905
DELTA FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY,

30:40.905 --> 30:41.506
RIGHT?

30:41.506 --> 30:42.540
DO YOU NOT FLY DELTA BECAUSE

30:42.540 --> 30:44.842
THEY FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY?

30:44.842 --> 30:46.211
OKAY, BUT THAT'S NOT

30:46.211 --> 30:47.078
THE SAME, IS IT?

30:47.078 --> 30:48.046
CELSIUS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD

30:48.046 --> 30:49.113
WITH MONEY.

30:49.113 --> 30:51.449
IF DELTA CRASHED FOUR BILLION

30:51.449 --> 30:52.050
PLANES AND DRINKING PEPSI GAVE

30:52.050 --> 30:53.184
EVERYONE INFINITY DIARRHEA, THEN

30:53.184 --> 30:53.851
YEAH, PEOPLE MIGHT LOSE TRUST IN

30:53.851 --> 30:56.354
THEM, AND FOR PRETTY FUCKING

30:56.354 --> 30:56.988
GOOD REASON.

30:56.988 --> 31:00.058
AND THE THING IS, THERE ARE

31:00.058 --> 31:00.792
STILL COMPANIES OUT THERE,

31:00.792 --> 31:04.329
MAKING ALL THE SAME CLAIMS THAT

31:04.329 --> 31:04.762
YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT.

31:04.762 --> 31:05.997
AND I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE ALL

31:05.997 --> 31:06.764
SCAMS.

31:06.764 --> 31:07.765
MAYBE THESE THREE ARE THE

31:07.765 --> 31:08.633
EXCEPTIONS, ALTHOUGH THEY'D BE

31:08.633 --> 31:10.335
JOINING ALL THE OTHER EXCEPTIONS

31:10.335 --> 31:11.002
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO TALK

31:11.002 --> 31:11.636
ABOUT TONIGHT, FROM BITCONNECT,

31:11.636 --> 31:12.203
TO QUADRIGA, TO SO, SO MANY

31:12.203 --> 31:17.508
MORE.

31:17.508 --> 31:20.612
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IN A FINANCIAL

31:20.612 --> 31:21.145
SYSTEM WHERE THE ONLY REAL

31:21.145 --> 31:22.380
CURRENCY IS CONFIDENCE, SCAMMERS

31:22.380 --> 31:25.049
ARE GOING TO THRIVE.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.484
AND I KNOW THAT WE USUALLY LIKE

31:26.484 --> 31:27.051
TO POINT TO A SOLUTION AT THE

31:27.051 --> 31:28.019
END OF OUR STORIES, AND THAT

31:28.019 --> 31:28.586
OFTEN MEANS CALLING FOR MORE

31:28.586 --> 31:30.121
REGULATION.

31:30.121 --> 31:32.090
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A GOOD

31:32.090 --> 31:33.458
IDEA HERE.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.059
THE DANGER IS, REGULATION MIGHT

31:35.059 --> 31:35.526
GIVE THIS SECTOR MORE

31:35.526 --> 31:36.894
LEGITIMACY.

31:36.894 --> 31:38.429
IT'D MAKE A RISKY INVESTMENT

31:38.429 --> 31:39.230
LOOK SAFE, WHEN IT IS CLEARLY

31:39.230 --> 31:44.469
NOT.

31:44.469 --> 31:45.236
AND THAT, IN TURN, THAT MIGHT

31:45.236 --> 31:46.304
ENTICE BANKS TO START GETTING

31:46.304 --> 31:46.938
MORE INVOLVED IN IT, GIVING THE

31:46.938 --> 31:47.905
SECTOR EVEN MORE LEGITIMACY, AND

31:47.905 --> 31:48.539
ALSO, EXPOSING ALL OF US TO ITS

31:48.539 --> 31:51.009
VOLATILITY.

31:51.009 --> 31:51.643
IT REALLY SAYS A LOT THAT ONE OF

31:51.643 --> 31:52.810
THE LEADING ADVOCATES FOR THE

31:52.810 --> 31:54.579
GOVERNMENT TO STRONGLY REGULATE

31:54.579 --> 31:58.483
CRYPTO WAS SAM BANKMAN-FRIED.

31:58.483 --> 31:59.384
AND LOOK, I'M ABSOLUTELY NOT

31:59.384 --> 32:00.451
SAYING WE SHOULD GET RID OF

32:00.451 --> 32:01.853
CRYPTO ENTIRELY.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.421
IT COULD EVENTUALLY BE USEFUL.

32:03.421 --> 32:03.988
MAYBE THE THIRD TIME THAT WE

32:03.988 --> 32:05.590
TALK ABOUT IT, WE'LL ALL BE

32:05.590 --> 32:06.157
USING A DIGITAL COIN TO BUY

32:06.157 --> 32:12.030
EVERYTHING.

32:12.030 --> 32:12.664
I DOUBT IT, BUT I CAN'T PREDICT

32:12.664 --> 32:12.964
THE FUTURE.

32:12.964 --> 32:14.666
AFTER ALL, I'M NO JIM CRAMER.

32:14.666 --> 32:15.466
BUT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT

32:15.466 --> 32:16.734
RIGHT NOW, THE MAIN THING YOU

32:16.734 --> 32:19.504
CAN REALLY DO WITH CRYPTO IS

32:19.504 --> 32:20.772
GAMBLE WITH MORE CRYPTO.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.140
THIS IS ALL STILL A CASINO.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.941
SO IF YOU DO WANT TO INVEST, DO

32:23.941 --> 32:25.209
YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE, NEVER

32:25.209 --> 32:27.512
PUT IN MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD

32:27.512 --> 32:28.880
TO LOSE, AND IF YOU EVER SEE

32:28.880 --> 32:30.348
SOMEONE DOING THIS.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.583
RUN.

32:32.583 --> 32:36.120
AND NOW, THIS.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.122
AND NOW, A LOOK AT

32:38.122 --> 32:38.723
A FEW MORE JIM CRAMER'S GREAT

32:38.723 --> 32:39.624
CALLS.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.693
COULD THIS BE THE FUTURE?

32:41.693 --> 32:43.261
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK WITH

32:43.261 --> 32:44.996
ELIZABETH HOULTON.

32:44.996 --> 32:49.300
TO ME, IT'S REASONABLE TO

32:49.300 --> 32:52.770
COMPARE YOU TO STEVE JOBS AND

32:52.770 --> 32:53.304
WHAT HE DID FOR COMPUTING.

32:56.107 --> 33:00.578
THE DATA, SVB FINANCIAL.

33:00.578 --> 33:01.179
THIS COMPANY'S EMERGING WITH A

33:01.179 --> 33:01.713
DEPOSIT THAT'S BEEN SAFELY

33:01.713 --> 33:02.747
CONCERNED ABOUT.

33:02.747 --> 33:03.314
I THINK THE FEARS WERE NOT

33:03.314 --> 33:06.984
JUSTIFIED.

33:06.984 --> 33:08.186
IT'S A COMPELLING SITUATION.

33:08.519 --> 33:09.187
ZOOM VIDEO.

33:09.187 --> 33:09.987
WHAT CAN I SAY?

33:09.987 --> 33:11.322
THIS IS THEIR ECONOMY.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.224
THE ZOOM OF ECONOMY.

33:13.224 --> 33:14.025
IT'S THE GREATEST STORY I'VE

33:14.025 --> 33:14.559
SEEN SINCE THE DAWN OF THE

33:14.559 --> 33:18.696
PERSONAL COMPUTER.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.669
BEAR STEARNS!

33:24.669 --> 33:30.375
IT WAS.

33:30.375 --> 33:30.942
NOW IT'S...

33:30.942 --> 33:31.909
GREAT BRITAIN, GREAT INVESTMENT

33:31.909 --> 33:34.579
BANK.

33:35.813 --> 33:43.020
YOU CLAIM THEY HAVE AN ARMY, BUT

33:43.020 --> 33:44.389
THAT ARMY'S GOING TO BE OVERRUN

33:44.389 --> 33:44.889
IN THE FIRST TWO HOURS.

33:44.889 --> 33:46.224
I FELT LIKE A MILLION BUCKS BUT

33:46.224 --> 33:46.991
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GET THE

33:46.991 --> 33:48.259
STOCK MARKET.

33:48.259 --> 33:48.826
PEOPLE SHOULD BE BUYING THE

33:48.826 --> 33:50.027
STOCK.

33:50.027 --> 33:51.929
THIS IS SO FOR REAL.

33:52.730 --> 33:55.133
YEAH, LET ME SAY THIS.

33:55.133 --> 33:57.001
I MADE A MISTAKE HERE.

33:57.001 --> 33:59.437
I WAS WRONG.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.171
I TRUSTED THIS MAN COMPLETELY.

34:00.171 --> 34:13.951
THAT WAS ILL-ADVISED.

34:14.886 --> 34:15.853
THAT'S OUR SHOW,

34:15.853 --> 34:16.788
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING!

34:16.788 --> 34:17.088
GOOD NIGHT!
