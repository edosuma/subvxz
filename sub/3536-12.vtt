WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:02.870
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:02.880 --> 00:05.280
for the murders of 14 young women.

00:05.315 --> 00:06.365
Has Roderick told you

00:06.400 --> 00:07.485
what I'd like you
to do for me?

00:07.520 --> 00:09.720
He said you wanted me
to follow Ryan Hardy.

00:09.755 --> 00:11.790
- Molly. 
- Hey, neighbor.

00:12.290 --> 00:13.140
You don't want to do that, Claire.

00:13.175 --> 00:14.222
Take me to my son.

00:14.257 --> 00:15.270
What's next, Joe?

00:15.280 --> 00:16.515
Enjoying my family.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.555
Now that you have
your family back,

00:18.590 --> 00:20.270
can I tell the others
we're ready to start?

00:20.305 --> 00:20.925
Not just yet.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.100
I got a delivery.
Can I go?

00:22.135 --> 00:23.205
Make it quick.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.180
What is this place?

00:24.215 --> 00:25.182
A military armory.

00:25.217 --> 00:26.115
Training grounds.

00:26.150 --> 00:27.155
- For what?
- Killing.

00:27.190 --> 00:28.625
My men are securing
the building now.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.260
It's like they're running
some kind of boot camp.

00:30.295 --> 00:32.159
I want every inch
of this place processed.

00:32.195 --> 00:34.130
The FBI discovered the camp.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.160
Vince led them there.

00:35.195 --> 00:36.390
It's impossible.

00:36.710 --> 00:38.990
You don't make decisions anymore,
Roderick.

00:39.025 --> 00:40.390
I am here now.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.370
Joe would like you to join him
for dinner tonight.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.010
Want to see your son?
Make an effort.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.450
Please let me see Joey.

00:47.485 --> 00:48.275
Good try, Claire.

00:48.310 --> 00:50.400
This is going to continue to be a charade

00:50.435 --> 00:51.512
until I see my son!

00:51.547 --> 00:52.555
Bring me my son!

00:52.590 --> 00:54.970
I really do believe that
you will love me again.

00:55.005 --> 00:56.190
Mom!

00:56.460 --> 00:59.380
Oh, my god, Joey. Oh, baby. Ohh.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.470 --> 01:10.680
What are we doing?

01:17.120 --> 01:17.890
Where are we going?

01:17.900 --> 01:18.855
Come on. Running away.

01:18.890 --> 01:20.950
Remember?
We're going home.

01:27.950 --> 01:29.140
Oh, damn it!

01:30.560 --> 01:31.980
Here. You go first.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.160
I'm right behind you, ok?

01:33.195 --> 01:34.330
Is there a problem, Claire?

01:38.080 --> 01:39.430
Something I can help you with?

01:47.810 --> 01:49.500
Uh, we were just going for a walk.

01:50.530 --> 01:52.090
Little early for that,
don't you think?

01:54.810 --> 01:55.980
Joey.

01:56.530 --> 01:58.570
You must be freezing.
You're in your pajamas.

01:58.890 --> 01:59.880
Come on.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.740
What do you say we go inside

02:02.775 --> 02:04.010
and get warmed up?

02:20.960 --> 02:21.950
Any shortness of breath,

02:21.960 --> 02:23.430
blurred vision, dizziness?

02:23.465 --> 02:24.930
No. Why?

02:25.370 --> 02:26.770
90 over 50.

02:27.340 --> 02:28.505
It's too low, Ryan.

02:28.540 --> 02:31.510
Eh, sometimes,
i have trouble breathing,

02:32.420 --> 02:35.360
and, you know,
just a little tightening here.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.120
You still taking
your beta blockers, digoxin?

02:38.155 --> 02:39.070
Oh, yeah.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.950
And when was your last echo?

02:41.860 --> 02:43.200
I'll make an appointment.

02:43.720 --> 02:44.870
Of course you will,

02:45.350 --> 02:47.280
and I will stop nagging you.

02:47.910 --> 02:48.890
Really?

02:49.300 --> 02:51.530
I will see you the next time
you blow through town.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.330
Hey. Molly, I-I really
do appreciate your help.

02:56.365 --> 02:57.310
Thank you.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.500
Just... don't get yourself killed.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.050
You know you can't
run off like that, Claire.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.925
Just makes both of us look bad.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.355
This is gonna allow you
to go a good 50 feet

03:18.390 --> 03:20.750
from the house
before the alarm goes off.

03:21.550 --> 03:23.525
If you do decide
to go AWOL again,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.500
you're not gonna get back
to that gate.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.780
Yeah.
We're always watching, Claire.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.090
Yeah. I see that,
Sheriff Nelson

03:34.100 --> 03:36.350
from Havenport, Maryland.

03:39.730 --> 03:41.100
You're not going anywhere.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.620
Morning, Claire.

03:44.930 --> 03:46.070
I understand that
you and Joey went

03:46.080 --> 03:47.810
for a little walk this morning.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.800
I do hope it wasn't
too cold for you.

03:52.510 --> 03:53.830
No. It was fine.

04:01.130 --> 04:05.090
Trust, I'm afraid,
must be earned.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.029
Donovan here?

04:21.040 --> 04:22.930
And the entire D.C. Office

04:22.965 --> 04:24.785
along with the DEA, the NSA,

04:24.820 --> 04:26.890
and a few other
high-ranking blowhards.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.390
Hey, Ryan. You remember Brad Pitt.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.015
That was a "Fight club" reference.

04:34.050 --> 04:36.520
Yeah. No. I got that.
Almost immediately.

04:38.830 --> 04:39.890
How you feeling?

04:40.050 --> 04:40.905
Yeah, I'm good.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.200
You know, it only hurts when I walk

04:43.235 --> 04:44.280
or talk or breathe.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.080
Sorry about Claire.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.530
This is Roderick
as well as I can remember.

04:52.565 --> 04:54.940
He's 5'10", 175 pounds, blond hair.

04:54.975 --> 04:56.070
He's a generic white guy.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.880
Put his face
through the recognition software.

04:57.915 --> 04:58.515
Nothing yet.

04:58.550 --> 05:00.045
He had a regional cadence,

05:00.080 --> 05:02.100
no traditional southern,
maybe midwest.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.370
Military brat?

05:03.930 --> 05:06.240
Well, how else do you explain
the military presence?

05:06.600 --> 05:08.110
Somebody recruited these guys for Joe.

05:08.145 --> 05:09.530
This is not Carroll's M.O.

05:10.270 --> 05:11.450
We know who owns this place?

05:11.460 --> 05:13.695
Us. It's government property.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.710
It's an old armory
they closed 15 years ago

05:15.745 --> 05:16.880
due to environmental hazards.

05:16.915 --> 05:17.980
It's what you thought,

05:18.015 --> 05:18.645
a boot camp

05:18.680 --> 05:19.640
where they studied and trained.

05:19.675 --> 05:20.670
Come see.

05:21.140 --> 05:22.385
We found training videos,

05:22.420 --> 05:25.440
programs, recruitment interviews.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.360
It was a full-on militia cell.

05:27.610 --> 05:28.690
Look at this.

05:37.110 --> 05:38.195
I'm hungry! Please!

05:38.230 --> 05:40.420
Typical cult indoctrination,

05:41.000 --> 05:42.255
food and sleep deprivation.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.770
Everyone was coded with an alias,

05:43.805 --> 05:45.120
so IDs are tricky,

05:45.670 --> 05:47.645
but we've connected
3 known members so far.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.585
So the explosives,
the military training,

05:49.620 --> 05:52.110
how does this connect
to what we know about Joe Carroll?

05:52.330 --> 05:53.440
There's more.

06:04.460 --> 06:05.720
"Tell-tale Heart,"

06:06.510 --> 06:07.780
"Pit and the Pendulum,"

06:08.700 --> 06:10.170
"Mask of the Red Death. "

06:10.450 --> 06:13.030
Carroll's message
is alive and well here.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.300
The idea of emotional salvation
through death.

06:17.340 --> 06:21.120
See, Joe's stealing
from various religions.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.215
You see these images?

06:23.250 --> 06:26.270
They suggest several afterlives.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.590
They're degrees of heaven.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.760
I see Islamic and Mormon beliefs,

06:30.770 --> 06:32.140
Scientology even.

06:33.020 --> 06:37.240
3 acolytes have
committed suicide for Joe.

06:37.580 --> 06:39.830
The greatest honor
is bestowed on those

06:39.870 --> 06:41.960
who sacrifice their lives.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.270
That's how you reach
the highest level of Carrollism.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.100
Did you just give
Joe's religion a name?

06:50.270 --> 06:51.700
Got to call it something.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.450
Aaron!

07:34.990 --> 07:36.040
Do you have a phone?

07:38.870 --> 07:40.110
Right. Thank you.

07:44.060 --> 07:46.575
Hang on one sec. Hello?

07:46.610 --> 07:48.450
Ah, Ryan, good morning.
How are you?

07:48.485 --> 07:50.567
Um, Ryan, I need your help.

07:50.602 --> 07:52.650
Hello, Joe. What is it?

07:53.180 --> 07:54.600
Mitchell, I need you
to run a trace

07:54.635 --> 07:55.585
on Ryan's cell.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.915
I've been getting
rather frustrated.

07:57.950 --> 08:00.175
I've been working away on our novel,

08:00.210 --> 08:04.220
and, uh, and as I-
as I come towards the end,

08:04.700 --> 08:07.320
I'm struggling somewhat with the-

08:07.355 --> 08:09.905
with the hero's character arc,

08:09.940 --> 08:14.180
the emotional through line,
if you will.

08:14.215 --> 08:15.440
Well, you're the literary scholar.

08:15.475 --> 08:17.785
And you are our hero.

08:17.820 --> 08:22.780
I- I really don't want you
to be the standard,

08:22.815 --> 08:26.410
stock do-gooder fighting injustice.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.610
Something wrong, Joe?

08:29.840 --> 08:32.375
You sound... desperate.

08:32.409 --> 08:35.830
Yeah. I need some-
some more backstory

08:36.020 --> 08:39.600
to help the reader understand
what motivates our hero.

08:39.635 --> 08:43.570
What defines Ryan Hardy?

08:43.900 --> 08:46.920
This plague of death t
hat surrounded you

08:46.930 --> 08:50.300
clearly started at an early age
with your mother.

08:50.335 --> 08:51.675
We know that, but,

08:51.710 --> 08:57.000
what's really interesting me is your-
your father.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.795
He was a cop, recently retired

09:00.830 --> 09:06.000
when he got gunned down
at a local convenience store.

09:06.530 --> 09:08.940
Would you mind telling me
a little bit about that?

09:10.110 --> 09:11.600
How did it affect you?

09:12.320 --> 09:15.000
I mean, after all,
you were only 17 at the time.

09:15.035 --> 09:16.000
Ok.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.400
What's wrong, Joe?

09:22.330 --> 09:24.860
Hey. Are you upset
that we found the armory?

09:26.130 --> 09:30.450
Yeah. It's, uh,
quite a setup you got here.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.400
I'm getting closer, aren't i?

09:42.780 --> 09:44.150
What was that all about?

09:44.430 --> 09:45.665
He's unraveling.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.170
Good. He'll get sloppy.

09:55.030 --> 09:56.060
I'll just be a minute.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.090
You need anything?

09:57.140 --> 09:58.130
No, I'm good.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.250
All right.

10:22.660 --> 10:23.740
Hey, guys!

10:24.630 --> 10:26.710
Hey, guys!
I think I have something.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.900
- What is it?
- So our military cult peeps,

10:28.935 --> 10:30.157
the ones who went after Mike,

10:30.192 --> 10:31.380
They're all part of freedom 13.

10:31.415 --> 10:32.675
Wait. The militia?

10:32.710 --> 10:33.735
The one led by Daniel Monroe?

10:33.770 --> 10:35.550
Joe Carroll is associated
with Daniel Monroe?

10:35.585 --> 10:36.545
You got to be kidding me.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.805
Catch me up.
Who's Daniel Monroe?

10:38.840 --> 10:41.030
He's a black market arms dealer.

10:41.090 --> 10:43.075
He's been on the FBI's radar for years.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.960
And he started a militia out
of West Virginia,

10:44.995 --> 10:45.865
violent separatists.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.205
They were heavily monitored.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.510
Monroe was and is suspected

10:48.520 --> 10:49.695
of black market contraband.

10:49.730 --> 10:50.835
They broke up a few years ago.

10:50.870 --> 10:52.390
So you think that's
how Carroll found

10:52.425 --> 10:53.835
and organized his resources?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.990
It explains
the entire militant presence.

10:56.025 --> 10:57.095
We need to find him.

10:57.130 --> 10:58.930
D.C. will have tabs on him.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.795
So what are the FBI
gonna find there?

11:01.830 --> 11:03.990
Most of our artillery
and explosives,

11:04.025 --> 11:05.610
training records, manifestos.

11:05.620 --> 11:08.070
Uh, in a word, everything.

11:10.610 --> 11:12.500
You could be
a little more upset about it.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.215
I'm freaking out inside.

11:14.250 --> 11:17.300
Can they use that information
to find this house?

11:17.335 --> 11:18.560
I don't see how.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.270
And besides, I'm monitoring the FBI
through state police.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.790
They're nowhere near this place.

11:22.825 --> 11:23.970
What about Daniel?

11:27.900 --> 11:32.110
Daniel? Your friend Daniel
the militia man?

11:33.420 --> 11:35.540
There's no way the FBI's
gonna find Daniel.

11:35.575 --> 11:36.810
I beg to differ.

11:37.110 --> 11:37.905
The illegal contraband

11:37.940 --> 11:39.760
could easily trace back to Daniel,

11:39.840 --> 11:42.000
and don't forget he helped us
find this house.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.150
They can trace it all they want.

11:43.185 --> 11:44.852
They're not gonna find him.

11:44.887 --> 11:46.485
Ok. So how am I gonna find him?

11:46.520 --> 11:48.860
I don't even know.
He's off the grid.

11:48.895 --> 11:49.975
That's how he operates.

11:50.010 --> 11:54.670
Damn it, Roderick,
he knows too much.

11:54.705 --> 11:57.370
Joe, we can trust him.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.380
I know how to find him.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.010
He's a friend, Joe.

12:08.340 --> 12:12.010
Hmm. This is precisely why
I won't be asking you to kill him.

12:16.780 --> 12:17.800
I'll do it.

12:22.110 --> 12:23.305
I'll do it myself,

12:23.340 --> 12:26.100
but, uh, you two, you come with me.

12:26.110 --> 12:29.300
You stay here and monitor the FBI.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.010
Joe, you cannot leave the house.

12:31.045 --> 12:32.400
It's too risky.

12:33.390 --> 12:34.860
That it may be.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.680
Not half as risky
as leaving it up to you.

12:51.000 --> 12:51.525
You ok?

12:51.560 --> 12:52.950
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:54.060 --> 12:55.600
Because if you need more time...

12:57.730 --> 12:59.220
Now you sound like my dad.

12:59.260 --> 13:03.110
I just... mean
you don't owe anything to anybody.

13:03.980 --> 13:05.175
Do you know my dad?

13:05.210 --> 13:07.120
It's like you're
channeling him right now.

13:08.550 --> 13:09.875
He's on with CIA.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.050
Monroe was last tracked
internationally.

13:12.085 --> 13:13.055
Trying to get his location.

13:13.090 --> 13:14.435
What about his friends and family?

13:14.470 --> 13:17.040
We did find an IP address
in the database here.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.535
Came from a house in Maryland.

13:18.570 --> 13:20.410
Property records indicate
that it's owned

13:20.445 --> 13:22.300
by a Gloria and Ronald Fowler.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.047
Yeah, and?

13:23.082 --> 13:23.725
Bryan Fowler.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.200
Their son, is a member of Freedom 13.

13:26.235 --> 13:27.035
We need to talk to him.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.530
No phone, but I do have an address.

13:28.565 --> 13:29.790
- Who wants it?
- Yeah.

13:33.310 --> 13:34.490
Stay in touch.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.980
Well, what's wrong with you?

13:50.690 --> 13:51.690
Nothing.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.970
You scared of the wife?

13:57.310 --> 13:58.810
I'm not scared.

14:00.210 --> 14:01.120
I'm just trying to find
the right moment

14:01.155 --> 14:02.370
to talk to her,

14:03.280 --> 14:04.530
be respectful.

14:04.630 --> 14:05.720
Respectful.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.840
Like when you slept
with her husband?

14:11.030 --> 14:12.400
Ex-husband.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.400
Why are you such an ass?

14:21.600 --> 14:22.570
What's past the trees?

14:22.605 --> 14:23.750
More trees.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.890
When are we gonna try
leaving again?

14:28.390 --> 14:29.190
Right now,
we just need to act

14:29.225 --> 14:30.285
as normal as we can,

14:30.320 --> 14:33.020
and hopefully we'll get out
of here soon, ok?

14:33.660 --> 14:35.680
And how is everybody doing in here?

14:36.140 --> 14:37.690
Sweetie, why don't you
go over there

14:37.725 --> 14:38.830
and get a game for us to play?

14:38.865 --> 14:39.750
- Ok.
- Ok.

14:44.910 --> 14:47.920
You, uh, enjoying your stay so far?

14:49.710 --> 14:50.890
Having a good time?

14:52.160 --> 14:56.000
So I take it you are
Joe's second in command.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.135
Joe and I go a ways back,

15:02.170 --> 15:03.910
but I'm not sure
second in command

15:03.945 --> 15:05.650
is how he'd describe me right now.

15:05.685 --> 15:06.640
You really a sheriff?

15:07.180 --> 15:08.140
Yes, ma'am, I am.

15:09.690 --> 15:10.695
Why be a part of this?

15:10.730 --> 15:14.300
You seem like a normal,
functioning person.

15:16.570 --> 15:18.160
Here I feel normal.

15:19.590 --> 15:20.960
Not so much anywhere else.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.940
What about-
what about these people?

15:24.975 --> 15:26.352
Are they, um, you know...

15:26.387 --> 15:27.730
Cold-blooded killers?

15:28.230 --> 15:29.010
Yeah.

15:29.290 --> 15:32.850
It's a mix.
There's a few hardcore psychos,

15:33.290 --> 15:35.445
some first-timers, groupies.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.210
What's the point here?
What is Joe hoping to get out of this?

15:40.370 --> 15:42.750
Well, for me,
it's about having a safe place

15:42.940 --> 15:43.970
where I can belong,

15:45.520 --> 15:47.060
where I don't have to be ashamed

15:47.380 --> 15:48.910
of my basic human nature,

15:50.140 --> 15:51.590
no matter how flawed.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.530
As for your husband,

15:55.740 --> 15:56.640
I don't know.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.080
You should ask him.

15:59.920 --> 16:03.160
All he seems to do is sit
and write his book.

16:05.780 --> 16:06.970
He's my ex-husband.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.690
Well, I'll leave you to your son.

16:13.950 --> 16:15.800
You know Joe can't be trusted, right?

16:58.290 --> 17:00.640
Hey. What are you doing?

17:00.930 --> 17:02.140
That's breaking and entering.

17:03.970 --> 17:05.349
Thought this was Ryan Hardy approved.

17:07.940 --> 17:08.990
I blame you for that.

17:27.819 --> 17:28.660
Warm.

17:57.870 --> 17:58.680
Freeze!

18:11.820 --> 18:12.750
What the hell was that?

18:20.640 --> 18:22.470
I owe you 6. Sorry.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.450
Can you do me a favor?
Can you just stand over-

18:28.540 --> 18:30.200
Stand over at that door
and just let me know

18:30.235 --> 18:32.060
if somebody's coming down
the hall, ok?

19:10.300 --> 19:12.520
So, Brian Fowler.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.110
I take it your parents
don't live here anymore.

19:16.350 --> 19:17.700
Where's Daniel Monroe?

19:18.050 --> 19:18.840
Daniel?

19:19.550 --> 19:21.370
Haven't seen that guy in months.

19:22.930 --> 19:23.525
He's lying.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.505
Yeah. See, the thing is

19:24.540 --> 19:26.820
it just seems like there's
more than one person living here.

19:27.070 --> 19:27.635
So?

19:27.670 --> 19:29.840
So we know that you were
both members of Freedom 13,

19:29.875 --> 19:31.062
And we know you remain friends.

19:31.097 --> 19:32.403
- He's not here!
- Where is he?

19:32.438 --> 19:33.710
I'm not doing your job for you.

19:35.260 --> 19:36.360
Hey. Take it easy.

19:36.690 --> 19:38.545
Come on.
What's going on with you?

19:38.580 --> 19:40.400
Weston, Weston!
Go stand over there.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.615
This place is such a dump.

19:45.650 --> 19:47.400
What's with all the alarm systems?

19:47.630 --> 19:49.550
What do you got so
valuable you got protect?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.660
I'm gonna take a look around.

19:55.880 --> 19:56.860
I'll get Nick on the phone,

19:57.040 --> 19:57.840
Get his team here.

19:59.480 --> 20:00.350
Go with Ryan.

20:52.890 --> 20:53.770
Don't move.

20:53.780 --> 20:54.640
Drop your gun.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.260
Daniel Monroe?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.990
I'm fBI.
I just want to talk to you.

20:59.570 --> 21:00.430
Drop your gun.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.530
No. You drop your gun.

21:12.350 --> 21:16.020
Ok. Let's talk.

21:23.040 --> 21:23.880
Having trouble?

21:25.840 --> 21:28.320
You block the signal?
You have a cell jammer?

21:28.355 --> 21:31.800
Maybe.
Not a big fan of cell phones.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.515
If you walk to the street,

21:33.550 --> 21:34.610
you should be ok, though.

21:46.190 --> 21:47.560
What the hell was that?
Is there more of you?

22:36.840 --> 22:38.040
- Hello, Claire.
- Denise.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.060
It's Emma.
Her real name's Emma.

22:41.530 --> 22:42.440
Where have you been?

22:42.475 --> 22:43.280
Hey, Joey.

22:44.340 --> 22:46.410
I was just giving you
and your mom some alone time.

22:47.070 --> 22:48.760
I would like to talk, Claire,

22:48.795 --> 22:50.450
if-if you have a moment.

22:54.940 --> 22:55.830
I can't...

22:56.990 --> 22:58.880
Imagine what you must feel about me,

23:00.920 --> 23:01.890
about all of this.

23:03.970 --> 23:04.895
I bet it's really awkward.

23:04.930 --> 23:08.400
Awkward?
You kidnapping my son is awkward?

23:08.435 --> 23:10.122
He was safe, Claire.

23:10.157 --> 23:11.775
I took good care of him.

23:11.810 --> 23:13.315
I always have.
Isn't that right, Joey?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.820
Do not talk to him,
do you understand?

23:14.855 --> 23:15.830
Don't even come near him.

23:18.550 --> 23:20.720
You're upset, and I get it.

23:20.755 --> 23:21.630
What do you want?

23:24.240 --> 23:28.180
We lived together
for two years, Claire.

23:30.270 --> 23:31.170
That was the first time
i felt like

23:31.205 --> 23:32.890
I was part of a real family.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.360
I always had the deepest
respect for you.

23:38.395 --> 23:39.415
I considered us friends.

23:39.450 --> 23:40.760
Just shut your mouth right now,

23:40.795 --> 23:42.140
You sick little girl.

23:43.830 --> 23:44.630
It's too soon.

23:47.350 --> 23:48.210
You need more time.

23:50.150 --> 23:50.930
We'll try again.

23:51.380 --> 23:52.560
I'll see you later, Joey.

23:54.940 --> 23:55.780
Stay here.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.285
Emma, make no mistake.

23:59.320 --> 24:00.840
I don't need any more time.

24:00.890 --> 24:02.940
From this point forward,
you will have nothing

24:02.950 --> 24:03.955
to do with my son.

24:03.990 --> 24:05.490
Don't even look in his direction.

24:07.590 --> 24:09.480
That's not your decision to make.

24:11.170 --> 24:12.800
Look. I was just trying
to be nice here.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.800
- Stay away from my son, or I-
- or what?

24:18.840 --> 24:20.860
Oh, you stupid bitch.

24:28.970 --> 24:30.080
Ladies!

24:30.130 --> 24:31.100
I- I will kill you.

24:31.380 --> 24:32.530
I will kill you!

24:32.730 --> 24:33.550
Ladies.

24:42.650 --> 24:43.800
So what is this place?

24:45.680 --> 24:46.620
It's my office.

24:46.780 --> 24:47.365
It's your office, huh?

24:47.400 --> 24:49.900
And all these Military-issue
assault weapons I see,

24:49.935 --> 24:51.280
they're for your
new militia or what?

24:51.315 --> 24:52.150
There's no militia.

24:52.330 --> 24:54.010
It was dissolved in 2009.

24:54.020 --> 24:55.870
Ok. So now you're an
independent contractor,

24:55.905 --> 24:56.765
online sales?

24:56.800 --> 24:58.350
Are you arresting me for something?

24:58.530 --> 24:59.675
Because I'd like to see a warrant.

24:59.710 --> 25:01.100
We know you've been helping
Joe Carroll.

25:01.135 --> 25:02.230
Do you have any proof of that?

25:03.260 --> 25:04.260
We found the armory.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.660
And we connected 5 of your men
to his cult.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.430
I have nothing to do
with Joe Carroll

25:14.465 --> 25:16.200
and his house of psychos.

25:16.235 --> 25:18.890
House? What house?

25:21.610 --> 25:22.525
I don't want to say any more

25:22.560 --> 25:24.125
until I, uh, speak with my lawyer.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.215
Listen to me.
There's not time for that.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.150
You got to tell us now.
Where is joe carroll,

25:27.185 --> 25:28.125
Where is this house?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.130
Not until I speak to my lawyer.

25:30.165 --> 25:32.100
You need to start talking now.

25:38.050 --> 25:38.920
What the hell is that?

25:40.820 --> 25:41.710
Somebody's down here.

25:43.330 --> 25:44.020
Parker.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.590
Stay with him.
I'm gonna check it out.

26:10.910 --> 26:12.050
Well, this sucks.

26:14.150 --> 26:14.910
Don't try it.

26:38.000 --> 26:38.730
Mike.

27:02.760 --> 27:03.510
Mike!

27:05.460 --> 27:06.430
Hello, Ryan.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.380
This... is an unexpected surprise.

27:10.415 --> 27:13.050
Take him out, Ryan.
Just do it.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.800
Tell me, agent Weston,

27:31.410 --> 27:34.220
Did my boys do to this to you, hmm?

27:34.550 --> 27:38.000
Does it, um... does it hurt?

27:39.670 --> 27:40.845
Kill him, Ryan!

27:40.880 --> 27:42.220
I don't care if he's dead!

27:42.720 --> 27:44.160
Kill him! Aah!

27:44.850 --> 27:45.970
He's not gonna kill you, Mike.

27:46.300 --> 27:47.810
He needs you to get out of here.

27:49.620 --> 27:52.520
Oh, you are very,
very bright, Ryan.

27:59.430 --> 28:00.280
Now, now!

28:00.710 --> 28:02.930
Don't be crude.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.320
Hey! Why don't you come out here

28:05.355 --> 28:06.330
and deal with me, huh?

28:06.340 --> 28:07.060
Come on!

28:08.880 --> 28:10.670
No. No. This...

28:11.650 --> 28:14.580
This is not the time, Ryan.

28:14.600 --> 28:18.200
Today wasn't-wasn't really meant to be.

28:18.390 --> 28:20.970
You know, these, uh,
these chance encounters

28:21.005 --> 28:22.900
that we keep having,

28:24.000 --> 28:25.890
no matter how enjoyable they are,

28:25.925 --> 28:29.250
they really do have to stop.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.860
Is there anyone else out there
with you, hmm?

28:34.020 --> 28:39.550
It looks like it's,
uh-it's just you and-and me.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.880
No. It-it's not the time to end.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.230
You know, the story
is still being written,

28:46.340 --> 28:49.550
and frankly, it is,
uh-it is proving quite challenging.

28:50.060 --> 28:52.220
That's what I was calling you about.

28:52.500 --> 28:55.530
Your character is in question.

28:56.470 --> 28:59.860
See, we've got to get it right.

28:59.895 --> 29:01.705
The death of your father,

29:01.740 --> 29:04.950
that was your defining moment,

29:04.985 --> 29:05.875
am I correct?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.785
You do realize that the FBI's

29:07.820 --> 29:09.660
about to descend on this place?

29:11.950 --> 29:12.830
You're done, Joe.

29:13.760 --> 29:18.900
Well, then there is, uh,
absolutely no reason to keep this

29:19.490 --> 29:22.480
battered little boy alive, is there?

29:23.210 --> 29:25.560
Shall I kill him?
Shall I kill him, Ryan?

29:26.150 --> 29:27.035
Stop, stop!

29:27.070 --> 29:28.640
- What?
- Ok, ok!

29:45.310 --> 29:46.180
Hello.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.260
It looks like you took
a pretty nasty blow

29:49.295 --> 29:50.260
to the nose there.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.010
Jacob Wells.

29:57.450 --> 29:58.820
It's nice to finally meet you.

29:59.820 --> 30:02.450
I see you made it out
of the farmhouse in one piece.

30:05.130 --> 30:06.370
What about your friend Paul?

30:11.170 --> 30:12.590
Well, he wasn't so lucky.

30:14.370 --> 30:15.420
And Emma?

30:17.010 --> 30:17.780
Where's she?

30:20.280 --> 30:22.090
Really? You want to chat?

30:22.710 --> 30:25.290
We can be friends and stuff?

30:27.320 --> 30:28.790
I am going to kill you.

30:30.720 --> 30:31.970
Indulge me.

30:33.610 --> 30:35.975
Help me to understand
what happened to you.

30:36.010 --> 30:39.100
Paul and Emma, it's easy to see
the trouble in their past,

30:39.160 --> 30:40.370
but you...

30:40.830 --> 30:43.450
you're a golden boy
from a golden family.

30:46.270 --> 30:47.810
It's not so obvious.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.040
Why'd you drop out
of medical school?

30:52.110 --> 30:54.520
Because I didn't want to be a doctor.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.080
Like your father?

30:58.720 --> 31:00.610
Your family is truly golden.

31:00.990 --> 31:04.610
Jacob, tell me what it is
i'm not seeing.

31:06.090 --> 31:07.860
Open your mouth again,

31:09.060 --> 31:10.550
and I stab you.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.170
Is this really
the time to play games, Joe?

31:16.230 --> 31:19.385
You father,
retired from the Albany PD,

31:19.420 --> 31:22.540
goes into a corner store
during a robbery.

31:22.610 --> 31:23.870
If you know the story-

31:23.905 --> 31:25.130
Well, where were you?

31:26.210 --> 31:27.940
This is sloppy of you, Joe.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.480
No. This is insane of me.

31:30.950 --> 31:35.890
Now your father,
he walks into the store, hmm?

31:36.290 --> 31:37.280
Where were you?

31:37.850 --> 31:40.610
Ok. Ok. I was outside.

31:41.590 --> 31:42.740
I was in the car.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.630
I- I-I heard gunshots.

31:57.470 --> 31:59.460
I just stood there,

32:00.640 --> 32:02.540
and I knew he was gonna pull
the trigger...

32:07.790 --> 32:08.820
but he didn't.

32:09.650 --> 32:10.840
You were spared.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.605
Why do you think that was?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.550
He panicked, he was on drugs,

32:16.420 --> 32:17.675
pure luck, I don't know.

32:17.710 --> 32:21.990
Luck. Luck is a word you should never be
allowed to use, Ryan.

32:22.970 --> 32:24.060
Do continue.

32:28.270 --> 32:29.500
Blood was everywhere.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.030
I'd never seen blood like that.

32:34.610 --> 32:36.050
And he was still alive?

32:36.085 --> 32:36.710
Yeah.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.510
He was still breathing.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.820
I knelt down, but...

32:47.690 --> 32:52.430
there were a lot-a lot of people
around him trying to help him,

32:52.500 --> 32:55.720
so I just... watched.

32:55.755 --> 32:58.940
Watched? Watched what?

32:59.000 --> 32:59.880
What the hell?

33:03.310 --> 33:05.795
I watched him die.

33:05.830 --> 33:10.690
And this was the first person you-
you had seen die.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.130
Yes.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.370
And there was nothing
you could do about it.

33:19.670 --> 33:21.150
You couldn't save him.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.260
What about the man
who robbed the store?

33:23.330 --> 33:24.430
What happened to him?

33:27.400 --> 33:29.610
They found him 3 days later.
Drug overdose.

33:29.630 --> 33:34.650
Oh. Drugs bought with the money
obtained from the robbery.

33:35.320 --> 33:35.840
Yes.

33:37.010 --> 33:41.250
Hmm. A kind of justice
prevailed then,

33:42.050 --> 33:45.700
and the world is-
is sometimes fair.

33:46.750 --> 33:47.600
No.

33:49.850 --> 33:50.740
Never.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.200
Why do you think

34:03.870 --> 34:06.440
you are surrounded...

34:08.370 --> 34:09.510
by death?

34:09.940 --> 34:12.960
Seeing your father dying,

34:14.280 --> 34:16.110
did it not fuel you?

34:17.179 --> 34:18.210
I don't know, Joe.

34:18.245 --> 34:19.230
Did it not...

34:20.780 --> 34:25.190
motivate you to- to want to do good?

34:25.389 --> 34:31.290
It is clearly why you want to help others,
save others.

34:31.800 --> 34:37.070
Every life is-
is Ryan Hardy's responsibility.

34:37.130 --> 34:42.409
Oh. Ryan, the narcissism in that is-

34:42.610 --> 34:43.969
is truly beautiful.

34:44.005 --> 34:45.330
No. That's not true.

34:45.364 --> 34:46.139
Then what...

34:46.850 --> 34:48.949
What drives you?

34:57.120 --> 34:58.230
What drives you?

34:59.920 --> 35:00.690
Death.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.190
Death does.

35:05.430 --> 35:10.570
It, uh, it fuels me.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.550
Me, too.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.080
Isn't that what you want to hear?

35:17.610 --> 35:19.030
It fuels me, too.

35:20.610 --> 35:22.195
We both seek it out.

35:22.230 --> 35:24.480
No, no. I don't-
i don't seek it out.

35:24.550 --> 35:27.480
Oh, yes, you do. 
It motivates your-

35:27.550 --> 35:29.890
your every move, Ryan,

35:30.930 --> 35:31.645
But why?

35:31.680 --> 35:34.340
That's-that's what we all want to know.

35:35.160 --> 35:41.150
What did you do t
o deserve your place in life?

35:43.900 --> 35:44.670
Nothing.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.760
It just is.

35:49.870 --> 35:54.390
We are... so alike, Ryan.

35:56.410 --> 35:58.160
It is through death

35:59.050 --> 36:02.040
that we both live.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.530
I got worried.
You've been down here a long time.

36:09.590 --> 36:11.940
Yes. I'd been wondering
when you'd work that one out.

36:11.975 --> 36:12.855
Somebody killed Vince.

36:12.890 --> 36:14.420
Here's how we're gonna do this.

36:14.530 --> 36:16.830
If Ryan so much as moves a hair,

36:17.560 --> 36:20.290
put a bullet through
the pretty lady's head.

36:20.325 --> 36:21.360
I think you should
put your gun down.

36:27.970 --> 36:28.970
Now kick it to me.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.090
It's a fine story, Ryan.

36:37.250 --> 36:41.010
I shall have to embellish it somewhat,

36:41.045 --> 36:44.770
add a twist, a little-pffooo-flair,

36:44.930 --> 36:46.280
something anyway,

36:48.130 --> 36:49.430
but thank you.

36:49.830 --> 36:54.450
It's, uh, been a great help to me.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.500
I'm good. Go!

37:42.080 --> 37:44.010
So Daniel Monroe wasn't a member
of Carroll's club,

37:44.045 --> 37:45.250
but he helped set it up.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.280
He introduced Carroll
to some of the Freedom 13.

37:47.315 --> 37:48.602
So you think Joe's in the area?

37:48.637 --> 37:49.890
According to Monroe, he is.

37:50.170 --> 37:52.050
Ok. Let's comb the county.

37:52.690 --> 37:54.020
How's the, uh...

37:54.320 --> 37:56.980
You know,
I played softball as a kid.

37:57.015 --> 37:58.720
I walked into a bat once.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.080
It's a little worse than that.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.590
Just wanted to let you know
that I was back.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.160
Joey-bless him- fast asleep.

38:16.195 --> 38:17.085
How was your day?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.405
I can't. I can't, Joe.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.450
Mine was particularly,
uh... difficult.

38:21.510 --> 38:22.880
Will you, uh-
will you drink with me?

38:22.950 --> 38:24.420
I've done all
the pretending I can do today.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.580
Oh. I've barely seen you today.

38:36.790 --> 38:37.800
It's not gonna work, Joe.

38:37.860 --> 38:39.960
Oh. Oh, come on.

38:40.030 --> 38:41.030
We've been through all this.

38:41.065 --> 38:42.290
No. Your plan.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.760
The one you're writing
about in your new book.

38:46.370 --> 38:47.220
I read it.

38:48.270 --> 38:49.110
It's not-

38:51.770 --> 38:52.475
It's not done yet.

38:52.510 --> 38:54.350
Do you honestly think
you're gonna get away with this?

38:54.410 --> 38:55.890
You shouldn't have
read that, Claire.

38:55.925 --> 38:57.295
Believe me, it wasn't easy.

38:57.330 --> 38:59.690
I guess you haven't really learned
anything since your last book.

38:59.725 --> 39:00.370
Don't-

39:15.900 --> 39:18.230
As Joe Carroll's murderous
rampage continues,

39:18.265 --> 39:20.100
we are slowly learning the identities

39:20.135 --> 39:21.050
of this killer cult.

39:21.170 --> 39:23.190
One of his followers is Jacob Wells.

39:23.270 --> 39:25.325
The son of a prominent
Virginia surgeon,

39:25.360 --> 39:27.380
Jacob lived a life
of privilege and wealth,

39:27.390 --> 39:29.820
yet he became one
of Carroll's most devoted followers

39:29.860 --> 39:31.580
after dropping out
of medical school.

39:31.820 --> 39:33.270
Enraged by that decision,

39:33.650 --> 39:36.020
his father cut Jacob off financially...

39:45.760 --> 39:48.550
Hello? Hello?

39:50.070 --> 39:50.830
Dad.

39:51.740 --> 39:52.980
Jacob, is that you?

39:56.400 --> 39:57.160
Jacob?

40:23.240 --> 40:25.090
I know you're upset with me.

40:27.210 --> 40:28.780
You've been ignoring me.

40:34.410 --> 40:35.050
Yes.

40:38.620 --> 40:39.550
Yes, I have.

41:04.810 --> 41:05.710
How you feeling?

41:06.480 --> 41:08.190
They're taking me
to a local hospital.

41:08.710 --> 41:10.100
Want to run some tests,
but I'm fine.

41:13.450 --> 41:14.740
You had me worried today.

41:16.860 --> 41:18.920
I went too far, I know.

41:20.510 --> 41:22.010
Not used to almost dying.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.490
Makes it harder
to do the right thing.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.370
Isn't always black and white.

41:31.500 --> 41:35.060
No. You just got to make sure

41:35.430 --> 41:38.100
that you don't do something
you can't live with

41:38.580 --> 41:41.460
because then you're
gonna spend your whole life

41:41.680 --> 41:43.060
just trying to make it right.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.620
You mean, your dad.

41:46.820 --> 41:47.840
I mean, you were young.

41:48.820 --> 41:49.970
What could you
have done about it?

41:54.330 --> 41:56.010
I don't need no more.

41:59.900 --> 42:01.120
Just a little more.
Come on.

42:12.210 --> 42:13.050
I'm good.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.700
No. Come on.
Take it.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.360
Just a little bit more.

42:22.390 --> 42:23.120
Take it.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.315
Hey, Ryan.

42:45.350 --> 42:46.740
I want to introduce you
to someone.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.270
All right. Get some rest, huh?

42:57.590 --> 42:59.800
This is sheriff Nelson of Havenport,

42:59.820 --> 43:00.640
neighboring town.

43:00.910 --> 43:01.470
Evening.

43:02.310 --> 43:03.740
So you really think
Joe Carroll and his people

43:03.775 --> 43:04.660
are in the area, huh?

43:05.100 --> 43:06.240
We think it's worth checking out.

43:07.130 --> 43:08.340
Whatever we can do to help.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.060
Great.
