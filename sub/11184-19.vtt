00:02.169 --> 00:03.375
Well, whad’ya see?

00:03.437 --> 00:06.145
An egg waiting to be cracked.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.945
I control this valley, Mr. Hawke.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.820
This land, these people, they're mine.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.518
You'll never get out of this country alive.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.654
Mr. Santini! Help us, please!

00:18.719 --> 00:20.596
Mr. Hawke! The dam!

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

02:15.969 --> 02:17.880
Open the bomb bay doors.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.474
With pleasure.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.990
Bomb bay doors open.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.450
Start the gyros.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.592
Start torpedo gyros.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.071
Bomb's ready.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.129
Altitude?

02:42.229 --> 02:44.800
60 meters and steady.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.340
For our comrades.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.717
Bombs away!

03:15.629 --> 03:18.337
The Revolution has come to America.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.231
I just can't do it, String.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.502
I've got to make that delivery over in Fresno.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.143
No, not me. No, no.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.703
See, I have to take my cousin and
his Scout troop to the circus.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.305
What, am I getting sandbagged or what?

03:57.370 --> 03:59.509
Oh, don't look at it that way.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.018
It might be fun.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.611
A weekend in the country
with a famous personality.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.050
Besides, I think she kind of likes you.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.754
Hey, are you guys ready?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.060
You have a nice trip.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.897
Look guys, I've had a real rough day.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.869
Now, are we going to get that
eggbeater up in the air,

04:19.926 --> 04:22.668
or do you want me just to stand
around here and wait all day?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.803
See? Caitlin may be right.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.340
Right about what?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.374
Well, String will explain on the way up.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.513
You all have a nice trip, now.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.449
Take off anytime you're ready, now.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.052
See you!

04:58.398 --> 05:01.470
Anderson and Porterfield go
to China with the President.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.173
Me, they send off to
interview a bunch of people

05:03.236 --> 05:06.410
who think the invention of indoor
plumbing was the downfall of man.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.317
My Producer's trying to punish me

05:08.375 --> 05:10.946
for that series I did on the
Mayor and his girlfriend.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.913
Next thing you know, he's gonna have me

05:12.979 --> 05:14.822
off covering the garbage strike in El Segundo.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.928
That doesn't sound so bad.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.463
Things could be worse.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.692
Worse? How could it be any worse?

05:21.755 --> 05:24.497
I'm supposed to do a 5-minute
light and lively TV spot

05:24.558 --> 05:28.096
about a group of people who've decided
to withdraw from the modern world.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.868
Who are these people?

05:29.930 --> 05:32.501
A small church in suburban Los Angeles.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.943
One day an oil company came along

05:34.000 --> 05:37.345
and offered them $10 million
for their land and the church.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.412
Well, they decided to take it

05:39.472 --> 05:42.009
and leave the city altogether, 5 families,

05:42.142 --> 05:45.021
start a new life with the money that they got

05:45.078 --> 05:47.718
like the first Christians lived.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.889
I don't have anything against these people.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.056
I mean, I respect their decision.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.529
It's just that it's hardly lifestyles
of the wealthy and famous, now is it?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.793
Doesn't sound like such a bad lifestyle to me.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.273
Living off the land.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.440
No rushing around. No crime.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.841
Still makes for a static
piece as far as I'm concerned.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.177
No telephone, no electric bills, no TV.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.948
Oh great, another critic.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.331
Hawke, look!

06:33.760 --> 06:36.297
Hawke, it's magnificent!

06:37.764 --> 06:40.176
The Tidewater Project.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.814
It was finished 1 year ago.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.608
It's 4 million cubic feet of concrete

06:48.675 --> 06:51.849
holding back 3 billion
gallons of man-made lake.

06:52.479 --> 06:56.723
It's the largest thing south of Grand
Coulee. I do my homework, Hawke.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.489
Yeah, right.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.265
That looks like the compound down there.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.043
You think you can set it
down in the center of it?

07:18.705 --> 07:20.810
In the center? Right in the middle?

07:21.207 --> 07:22.845
I like to make a big entrance.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.508
Well, hallelujah!

08:54.267 --> 08:56.941
I want to say today that
we should not be amiss.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.746
In fact, we should be thankful today,

08:59.806 --> 09:02.377
because God has blessed us.

09:02.442 --> 09:06.288
He's blessed us with an
opportunity to shine in his image,

09:06.813 --> 09:10.056
to live a life that marks an earlier time.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.597
The time that I speak of is a time
when Saints walked upon the earth,

09:13.653 --> 09:15.792
hand in hand with men.

09:16.289 --> 09:20.237
A time when books were
written that we live by today.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.934
Times before drugs and modern war.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.204
Times before pornography and immoral sex,

09:27.700 --> 09:31.238
before prostitution, murder and hate.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.585
A time before that poison.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.450
You know the times I'm talking about.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.984
And that's the reason why we're here today.

09:41.047 --> 09:44.688
Because some of us dared
to ask one simple question.

09:46.686 --> 09:47.892
Who needs it?

09:48.721 --> 09:50.894
What about you? Or you?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.628
What about you, Miss Dayton?

10:07.006 --> 10:09.543
Now, these are the shelters that
we set aside for your stay here.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.883
I'm sure you'll be more than comfortable,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.582
or at least as much so
as the rest of the group.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.454
- They're fine, but I…
- Now, we've got some strong ideas

10:14.514 --> 10:16.460
about certain matters here
that we hope you'll respect.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.517
Of course.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.586
Unmarried men and women
don't stay in the same place.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.893
So Mr. Hawke, you'll be staying over there.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.862
Well,

10:24.491 --> 10:27.301
- I'm gonna be flying out before dark.
- Uh-huh.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.068
Yeah, but you're coming back in a
few days to pick me up, right?

10:31.297 --> 10:35.211
Well, perhaps at that time you'll send
him away and elect to remain with us.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.938
I don't think so.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.148
Anything is possible, Miss Dayton.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.365
Are you gonna be okay?

10:58.825 --> 11:02.932
It's what the French call a
“frisson.” It's a little shiver.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.842
They say a moment of silence
comes when an angel passes

11:07.667 --> 11:10.341
and a shiver, when the devil walks by.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.407
Yeah. I wonder what that says
about our Brother Jebediah.

11:13.706 --> 11:14.707
Yeah.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.781
I guess he wasn't quite what you expected.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.389
I try not to expect anything on an assignment,

11:21.447 --> 11:24.360
but he was a surprise.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.530
So, you'll be going back tonight.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.860
Yeah. I'll be back in 3 days to pick you up.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.530
3 days in this place,

11:35.595 --> 11:38.041
that ought to be a challenge.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.772
But I signed on to see the world.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.676
I'm sure you'll be just fine.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.814
You should never have let them come.

11:52.011 --> 11:55.220
I cut a fine figure as a man
of God, don't you think, Hana?

11:55.381 --> 11:59.591
That reporter and that
Hawke are trouble, Rector.

11:59.652 --> 12:03.122
You should never have let them get
within 100 miles of this place.

12:03.489 --> 12:06.095
Longwood already gave them permission.

12:06.626 --> 12:10.199
Now, if I'd turned them away, it would've
only intensified their curiosity.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.874
Now, it's vital that things appear to be

12:12.932 --> 12:15.708
as peaceful as possible
in this valley right now.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.281
Besides, I've got some big
plans for Miss Kelly Dayton.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.848
What kind of plans?

12:23.910 --> 12:27.153
She is about to become a bigger
star than she ever imagined.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.493
So might we all, as a matter of fact.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.830
You enjoy this too much, Johann.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.199
Don't you call me by that name.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.830
Well, that is the name you were born with.

12:41.894 --> 12:46.707
Johann Rector, Germany, 1944.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.272
Just so you do not forget.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.507
Now, you've got no right.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.243
I have every right,

12:52.405 --> 12:55.443
when I see a member of the
brotherhood forgetting his duty,

12:55.508 --> 12:58.512
forgetting the ones in prison
we are sworn to free,

12:58.578 --> 13:01.718
forgetting the vision of the world
that we are sworn to achieve.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.885
You stop it.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.828
We came here for cover.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.901
And now I think you enjoy making your sermons,

13:12.258 --> 13:14.898
stroking your beard, and being a man of God.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.639
I am warning you.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.112
Do not lose your way.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.773
Please.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.313
Your concern is noted, Hana.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.749
But now, I have to prepare for an interview.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.202
I'm talking with 16-year-old Sara Longwood.

13:48.394 --> 13:52.308
It was Sara's letter to
Station KWWT last spring,

13:52.365 --> 13:54.038
which brings me here today.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.479
Yes, I'm Sara.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.652
And this is my Mother, Sister Estelle.

14:02.742 --> 14:06.451
I asked you to come because I wanted
to show the outside world that…

14:08.981 --> 14:12.155
Go on, Sara. Why did you
invite us to your valley?

14:16.089 --> 14:19.093
I heard about all the
troubles in the outside world.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.731
And I wanted to show how we live in peace,

14:23.329 --> 14:24.330
with all men.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.440
As a kind of example.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.145
Yes, as an example.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.554
How does it feel, Brother Jebediah,

14:39.612 --> 14:42.991
to be living in a 19th century community

14:43.049 --> 14:47.293
right in the shadow of the nation's
newest hydroelectric installation?

14:47.520 --> 14:50.524
Well, we were here long before
the government built the dam.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.036
But, as always, according
to our original covenant,

14:53.092 --> 14:55.402
I intend to live in peace
with all our neighbors.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.940
Until the Judgment Day, of course.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.876
Do you fear the 20th century?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.102
Now, what man living in today's world

15:02.201 --> 15:03.544
would not look at the 20th century

15:03.603 --> 15:05.378
without a certain amount of trepidation?

15:05.438 --> 15:08.749
I'm kind of curious how you
know about the outside world.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.515
I mean, outside of this valley.

15:11.411 --> 15:15.450
Don't your rules outlaw you any
knowledge of the modern media?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.825
I'm the one conducting this interview, Hawke.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.161
Point of fact,

15:22.221 --> 15:25.532
since you don't allow newspapers,
radios, or television,

15:25.591 --> 15:29.038
what is your source of information
about the outside world?

15:29.095 --> 15:31.302
Well, believe me, I know about
the real world, Miss Dayton,

15:31.364 --> 15:32.934
and the cataclysms to come.

15:32.999 --> 15:36.310
The noon meal is about to be
served, Brother Jebediah.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.712
Now, would you care to join us for some lunch?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.013
- That'd be fine, thank you.
- Great.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.968
As we break bread, let us
remember the benevolence

15:59.025 --> 16:00.629
that brought us all together

16:00.693 --> 16:02.366
in this valley of peace

16:02.762 --> 16:04.366
surrounded by a hostile world.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.746
Sara,

16:16.175 --> 16:20.385
do you miss things that other
children in the outside enjoy?

16:20.446 --> 16:22.426
Movies, dancing,

16:22.482 --> 16:26.453
or just going shopping with your
friends for records or clothes?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.355
What about just going to the beach

16:28.421 --> 16:30.025
for a day in the sun?

16:33.826 --> 16:36.534
Go ahead Sara, tell them what's in your heart.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.138
I know what other children do.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.341
I've seen them when we go
in the town with our goods.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.439
I hear their music, and I really like it.

16:48.908 --> 16:53.084
But I know it's not for me.
I'm different. We all are.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.093
And that world isn't for us.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.555
You ever get lonely, Sara?

17:01.153 --> 17:05.602
Being the only child in this village here?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.136
I… I…

17:15.201 --> 17:17.840
You'll have to excuse my wife.
She's not herself today.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.943
She's not used to having
her younger children away.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.049
Well, then there are other
children in this compound?

17:25.111 --> 17:27.954
Well no, not here. They're
away at our other retreat.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.322
Up at Lake Joshua.

17:29.448 --> 17:32.452
A camp. I would love to get that on tape.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.690
Do you think we can go up there?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.528
No Miss Dayton, that won't be possible.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.659
The retreat has to remain completely private,

17:37.723 --> 17:39.464
away from all outside disturbances,

17:39.525 --> 17:41.471
if it is to achieve the required result.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.201
Anyway, they'll be back in a
week or so, isn't that right?

17:44.363 --> 17:47.173
Yes, in a week or so.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.080
It's hard to believe this used to be an old

17:58.144 --> 18:00.090
World War II Army Airbase.

18:00.680 --> 18:05.288
Longwood must have bought this for
his community through surplus.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.827
It's pretty incongruous, isn't it?

18:09.889 --> 18:13.359
All these women straight out of
Jane Austen, sowing their crops.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.669
And right over there, the ghosts
of old World War II fighters.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.006
Bombers.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.839
Bombers.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.341
But it sure is peaceful now, though.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.342
And I can't blame them for
choosing this place, either.

18:28.908 --> 18:29.909
Look at it.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.922
It's beautiful.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.734
Excuse me a second, Kelly.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.330
Sara.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.704
You mind if I have a sip?

18:55.835 --> 18:57.075
Here, let me.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.844
I have to talk to you.

18:59.905 --> 19:03.216
Your helicopter, can it fly all
the way to the outside world?

19:03.275 --> 19:04.754
Well, sure.

19:05.277 --> 19:08.554
The nearest town's only about 15
miles away, as the crow flies.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.150
Sara!

19:10.483 --> 19:12.019
Time for vespers!

19:15.688 --> 19:17.292
After vespers,

19:17.356 --> 19:20.826
come to the woods behind
the smokehouse, please.

19:41.447 --> 19:43.051
You know, Kelly,

19:43.115 --> 19:44.992
looks like I'll be spending
the night here after all.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.664
What are you do’n here?

20:20.953 --> 20:21.988
Noth’n.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.397
Oh, you just hang’n out?

20:23.923 --> 20:27.564
Well you know, there's not a whole lot
to do here if you're not a true believer.

20:27.626 --> 20:28.934
Well, if you're not a true believer,

20:28.994 --> 20:30.974
why don't you just get the hell outta here?

20:32.698 --> 20:35.770
Gentlemen, please, let's not
have any unpleasantries.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.908
You'll have to excuse Brother Ahab's zeal.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.173
Sometimes it is a bit overwhelming.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.616
You call it zeal,

20:45.678 --> 20:47.555
I call it look’n for trouble.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.689
You know he was nos’n around, don't you?

20:52.351 --> 20:54.558
Would you excuse us a minute, please?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.794
You've got to have more respect
for our guests, brother.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.662
Who knows how much longer
they're gonna be with us.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.872
Hawke.

21:37.696 --> 21:38.902
What are you do’n here?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.274
I might ask you the same thing.

21:42.334 --> 21:44.871
I was just out tak’n a little walk.

21:45.905 --> 21:49.318
I never saw a reporter take a little
walk at night in a place like this.

21:49.375 --> 21:52.185
Oh? What do you think could happen?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.146
I don't know.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.018
There's just someth’n about this place.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.426
I get a funny feel’n.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.132
You know that little girl, Sara?

22:02.188 --> 22:03.667
She's scared to death.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.565
Well, she asked to meet me out here tonight.

22:05.624 --> 22:07.262
What did she say?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.997
She didn't say anything.
She didn't get a chance.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.804
This guy that's always with Rector
came up and scared her off.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.538
But I really think she was
trying to tell me someth’n.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.014
She probably wishes she was up at
that camp with those other kids.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.073
That camp at Joshua Lake?

22:21.574 --> 22:23.349
There is no Joshua Lake around this area.

22:23.409 --> 22:24.945
I checked the charts in the chopper.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.254
Then what the hell did the preacher say?

22:30.249 --> 22:32.126
That sounds like a semi-diesel.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.254
Sure does.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.895
It can't be.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.900
It's not part of their work ethic.

22:37.656 --> 22:39.135
I'm gonna check it out.

22:39.325 --> 22:40.599
I'm going too.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.697
Yeah, I figured as much.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.148
That's a bomber!

23:32.211 --> 23:35.658
B-25. And those rockets
and bombs are for real.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.986
Who are they? What do they want?

23:39.051 --> 23:42.863
They trucked that plane in here by
sections and then reconstructed it.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.129
The only thing that makes sense
is they're after that dam.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.466
They must be the same people that
blew up that hydro project last year.

23:48.527 --> 23:51.770
They were never caught.
Hundreds of lives were lost.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.165
Yep.

24:26.432 --> 24:27.740
Battery's dead.

24:29.601 --> 24:31.603
Let's hope it's just a loose connection.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.920
Oh boy, they really did
a number on us this time.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.391
Battery's gone.

24:42.781 --> 24:43.953
Then we're trapped.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.265
Yeah. Just keep it cool.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.834
A problem, Mr. Hawke?

24:52.925 --> 24:56.668
Well, someone seems to have done some
midnight sabotage on my aircraft here.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.505
I was afraid something like that might happen.

24:59.565 --> 25:01.067
Some of our people react violently

25:01.133 --> 25:04.410
to the mere presence of any
kind of modern devices.

25:04.536 --> 25:07.346
They perceive them to be satanic forces.

25:07.606 --> 25:08.846
Satanic, huh?

25:11.477 --> 25:14.219
May I assume that you'll
have my battery returned

25:14.279 --> 25:17.419
early enough for Miss Dayton
here to make her deadline?

25:17.483 --> 25:19.087
If I'm not back by tomorrow morning,

25:19.151 --> 25:20.789
my Producer's gonna hit the ceiling.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.130
He needs this segment to fill
out the 11:00 special edition.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.329
Miss Dayton, I don't think you
have to worry about your Producer.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.602
I'm sure he'll be more than pleased
by the time everything's through.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.699
Now, if you'll just accompany Sister Hana,

25:32.765 --> 25:34.142
she'll make you very comfortable.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.735
And by the way, for your own safety,

25:35.801 --> 25:37.781
I suggest that you remain in your room.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.548
I need to make a phone call first.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.714
I don't think that'll be necessary.

25:59.591 --> 26:02.094
It's not like String to miss a call-in.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.865
Dom, you know there are no phones up there.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.273
Maybe his radio can't get through.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.905
Maybe, but Stringfellow Hawke

26:08.967 --> 26:11.311
never missed a flight plan check in his life.

26:11.370 --> 26:12.747
And if he doesn't call in pretty soon,

26:12.805 --> 26:14.341
I'm gonna start get’n nervous.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.628
I just had another one.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.124
Another what?

26:29.788 --> 26:31.927
Frisson, little shiver.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.499
I saw us dying in this room, Hawke.

26:36.895 --> 26:38.841
Guess I'm not as tough as I thought I was.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.205
I'll tell you Kelly,

26:41.467 --> 26:43.174
those people are rough.

26:43.902 --> 26:46.109
If they're the ones that blew that dam,

26:46.171 --> 26:48.378
they don't give a hoot about human life.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.189
I'll guarantee you one thing,

26:52.744 --> 26:54.246
we'll get outta here.

26:56.381 --> 26:59.487
Okay, I'll take that guarantee.

27:00.552 --> 27:01.758
You have a plan?

27:02.421 --> 27:03.559
Maybe.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.602
But I'm not sure you'd approve.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.225
Hello! Is anybody out there?

27:34.953 --> 27:37.797
I'd like to freshen up.
Can you bring me some water?

27:38.524 --> 27:40.868
Please, I'd really like to freshen up.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.131
Please?

27:50.169 --> 27:52.649
Pass me the bowl, I'll fill it.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.173
Here!

28:40.953 --> 28:42.364
Food for the hostages.

29:12.784 --> 29:13.785
Move it!

29:27.132 --> 29:29.043
Mr. Hawke! Miss Kelly!

29:29.368 --> 29:31.370
They came in the middle of the
night with their weapons.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.006
We had no way of stopping them.

29:33.071 --> 29:36.211
They threatened to kill the children
if anyone went against them.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.085
Well, we're gonna have to move
fast before they give an alarm.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.954
None of us are gonna make it out of
here if we go by the main roads.

29:42.180 --> 29:45.627
Maybe one person who went
across country might make it.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.929
Who's the best rider here?

29:54.726 --> 29:55.830
I am.

30:00.932 --> 30:03.105
Get up, we cannot take any chances!

30:03.168 --> 30:05.375
We must make sure they don't reach the outside.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.064
Here's a number and some change.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.500
You stay in the trees until
you see them coming after me.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.061
And you ride as fast as
you can. You hear me, Sara?

30:30.529 --> 30:32.065
Go on, get! Go!

30:32.197 --> 30:33.835
Go, Sara. Get out of here.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.344
Come on, everything's just like it was.

30:39.404 --> 30:40.940
I understand, inside please.

31:15.741 --> 31:18.517
Rector, this is Hana. Hawke
and the girl have escaped.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.488
They are in the woodman's
carrier, headed your way.

31:20.545 --> 31:21.546
Do you read me?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.711
That was a stupid thing to try.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.085
I control this valley, Mr. Hawke.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.647
This land, these people, they're mine.

32:30.115 --> 32:34.063
I don't care how many unarmed farmers
and children you've terrorized,

32:34.119 --> 32:36.656
you're not ever gonna get away
with blow’n up that dam.

32:36.721 --> 32:41.261
As long as the US Government has 2 dozen
of our members in federal penitentiaries,

32:41.326 --> 32:44.899
we will continue to destroy
your industrial infrastructure.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.336
I didn't know animals like you needed a reason.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.880
Chaos brings anarchy, and out
of anarchy comes new order.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.145
And you, Miss Kelly Dayton,
are going to be there

32:54.206 --> 32:55.981
to record it for the entire world.

32:56.041 --> 32:58.214
I'm taking you and your camera with us

32:58.276 --> 33:01.723
to make sure this event receives the
prime-time coverage it deserves.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.422
You must be out of your mind.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.460
What's the matter? Don't you
want the job of a lifetime?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.990
You'll never get out of this country alive.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.462
Don't worry about us.

33:14.526 --> 33:15.971
And if you think your little, young messenger

33:16.027 --> 33:18.371
is going to get through to the outside world,

33:18.430 --> 33:20.137
well, you're sadly mistaken.

33:54.299 --> 33:55.300
Yes.

33:56.067 --> 33:59.879
I need to speak to Mr. Dominic Santini.

34:00.605 --> 34:04.417
More money? Yes, I have more money. How much?

34:07.078 --> 34:09.080
Oh, please! Please, hurry!

34:11.783 --> 34:12.818
String!

34:12.884 --> 34:15.194
Mr. Santini! Help us, please!

34:15.687 --> 34:16.688
Who?

34:16.755 --> 34:18.893
Mr. Hawke! The dam!

34:34.005 --> 34:36.076
Line's gone dead.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.779
Well, who was it?

34:38.310 --> 34:39.947
It was the voice of a little girl,

34:40.011 --> 34:43.185
and then she said that String was in trouble,

34:43.248 --> 34:46.252
and then somebody must have
pulled her away from the phone.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.792
String is in trouble?

34:50.956 --> 34:52.833
I think we'd better take
the lady for a look-see.

34:52.891 --> 34:53.891
Yeah.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.076
Tomorrow, a wall of water about 100 feet high

35:04.135 --> 35:05.842
will sweep through this valley.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.680
At least you won't die alone, Mr. Hawke.

35:10.575 --> 35:13.419
Take him out and put him
with the rest of the hostages.

35:16.448 --> 35:21.090
Not so fast! Do you know
how to do aerial photography?

35:21.152 --> 35:23.359
'Cause I'll tell you one
thing, I don't have a clue.

35:23.421 --> 35:24.661
Now, Hawke here is an expert.

35:24.723 --> 35:25.963
It's what he does for a living.

35:26.024 --> 35:28.300
You want this thing done, you're
gonna have to use both of us.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.768
Make up your mind.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.506
You're right.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.738
This is the biggest story I'll ever see.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.711
When we're ready to leave,
they'll both accompany us.

35:58.356 --> 35:59.892
Do you miss it?

36:01.026 --> 36:03.529
Actually, I think it suited me quite well.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.364
It did not suit you.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.702
We cannot be too soon out of this place.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.547
You're a fine comrade in arms Hana,

36:12.604 --> 36:14.845
and a warm companion on a cold night,

36:14.906 --> 36:16.908
but your soul's about a tiny thing.

36:19.077 --> 36:22.991
Soul? That's a weak word for a soldier.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.697
I have become more than a soldier.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.126
You have gained nothing.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.063
You've lost.

36:34.325 --> 36:35.395
Lost what?

36:35.460 --> 36:37.133
The ability to lead.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.574
You would rather be a raving
preacher with a flowing beard

36:40.632 --> 36:42.703
than a sword in the side of our enemies.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.510
I am still a sword.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.774
I'm about ready to drown half the world.

36:48.339 --> 36:50.216
Yes, that was the plan,

36:50.275 --> 36:52.812
but how are we supposed to evacuate everyone?

36:52.877 --> 36:54.117
In the aircraft.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.252
And there is room for us all?

36:57.348 --> 36:58.691
Of course.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.059
Except you want to take
Hawke and that reporter.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.262
So you can have your biblical
cataclysm recorded on film.

37:07.525 --> 37:09.971
Well, which of us will you leave behind?

37:15.266 --> 37:16.870
You can leave me.

37:31.783 --> 37:35.196
Dear Lord, we've done harm to no man.

37:36.020 --> 37:40.628
We've lived in peace in
accordance to your covenant.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.700
And now we ask that you,

37:44.062 --> 37:47.168
in your divine, mighty power and love,

37:49.501 --> 37:50.741
will deliver us.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.694
What happened, child?

38:13.758 --> 38:15.237
I heard a voice.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.172
I tried to tell them, but I
don't know if they heard.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.403
It's all right. Now listen,

38:21.833 --> 38:23.779
God will not abandon us.

38:25.570 --> 38:26.571
He will not.

38:57.869 --> 38:58.870
Hana!

39:10.682 --> 39:12.286
Forget about them. Get aboard!

39:16.955 --> 39:18.229
Look, stop being so stupid!

39:18.289 --> 39:21.327
Without a vehicle, you'll never
make it to high ground. Come on!

39:23.795 --> 39:25.797
We gotta live to fight another day.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.205
There it is, Dom. Approach to Tidewater Valley.

40:41.039 --> 40:44.020
Dom, there's something
coming up on the thermal scan.

40:44.642 --> 40:45.780
Looks like a plane taking off,

40:45.843 --> 40:48.790
and there's a group of people in
that structure near the woods.

40:49.647 --> 40:51.752
People in the structure first.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.242
Longwood, clear the door. I'm blow’n the lock!

41:15.606 --> 41:16.744
Come on!

41:17.542 --> 41:18.543
Come on!

41:33.424 --> 41:35.529
Kelly, get all these people
to the high ground up there,

41:35.593 --> 41:37.368
just in case I can't stop that bomber.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.032
- Okay, I know.
- Come on, move!

42:11.596 --> 42:13.439
Well, whad’ya see?

42:14.332 --> 42:17.973
An egg waiting to be cracked.

42:24.976 --> 42:28.321
You know, using an old bird like
a B-25 doesn't make any sense.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.416
Well, you have to have a
pretty substantial warhead

42:30.481 --> 42:31.983
to make a dent in a dam like this

42:32.050 --> 42:33.586
and still make a getaway.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.995
If this canyon below us fills with water,

42:36.054 --> 42:38.034
those people back there won't have a chance.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.564
Target distance, 10 miles.

42:45.630 --> 42:47.200
Open the bomb bay doors.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.146
Bomb bay doors open.

43:04.449 --> 43:06.759
Steady. Steady.

43:22.900 --> 43:23.901
Hey, duck!

43:35.179 --> 43:36.783
Start the bomb gyros.

43:40.718 --> 43:42.254
Torpedo armed.

43:42.653 --> 43:44.929
For our comrades and the Revolution!

44:26.797 --> 44:28.470
The biggest story of my life,

44:28.533 --> 44:31.742
and I didn't even get one lousy
foot of tape that I can use.

44:32.436 --> 44:33.847
What do you plan on reporting?

44:33.905 --> 44:35.043
Don't worry.

44:35.106 --> 44:37.985
I'm not gonna blow the cover on
that fantastic machine of yours.

44:38.609 --> 44:40.520
At least not this time.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.852
I think we're starting to draw a crowd.

44:49.287 --> 44:50.630
Well, now.

44:52.056 --> 44:53.797
Anybody want a ride in this?

44:54.158 --> 44:56.661
Oh no, I don't think we can.

44:56.727 --> 44:59.139
I wouldn't be too certain of that.

44:59.463 --> 45:01.943
Perhaps just once wouldn't hurt.

45:01.999 --> 45:05.242
Mr. Hawke, you and your friends,

45:05.670 --> 45:07.581
you helped me to realize

45:07.638 --> 45:09.879
that everything that comes
to us from the outside world

45:09.941 --> 45:11.420
is not to be feared.

45:12.076 --> 45:13.817
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Longwood,

45:13.878 --> 45:15.983
you've got an awful nice life up here.

45:17.415 --> 45:19.895
I wouldn't be in too big a hurry to change it.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.394
Thanks.

45:23.821 --> 45:25.095
Both of you.

45:25.289 --> 45:26.791
All right, kids.

45:26.857 --> 45:28.268
Which one is gonna go first?

45:31.162 --> 45:32.664
Let's get the kids up close.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.539
Hey, hold on kids.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.973
One at a time. We'll all get a ride.

45:37.305 --> 45:43.693
