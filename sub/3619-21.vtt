WEBVTT

00:07.659 --> 00:09.183
Can you hand me the tire iron?

00:09.357 --> 00:10.880
Uh... yeah, sure.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.186
Here.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.535
That's a lug bolt.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.450
Oh. [chuckles]

00:15.624 --> 00:16.929
It's all right. I got it.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.931
That's the tire iron, huh?

00:19.106 --> 00:20.629
Well, I, uh...

00:20.803 --> 00:22.761
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.546
I mean, I probably
could have just called

00:24.720 --> 00:25.590
a tow truck, you know.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.375
Oh, it's no problem.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.594
Too bad you didn't
get this before class.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.640
Could've avoided
Dr. Rousseau's lecture

00:31.814 --> 00:32.858
on cognitive dissidence.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.078
Yeah, pretty dull, huh?

00:35.252 --> 00:36.906
Thought about leaving, but...

00:37.080 --> 00:39.822
felt bad about skipping class
so I ended up staying.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.303
To avoid your own dissidence?

00:44.174 --> 00:46.568
Yeah, you're pretty good
at this psychology stuff.

00:46.742 --> 00:47.743
You should read my column.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.092
I do.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.662
Why don't we get together
sometime and study?

00:53.836 --> 00:57.492
Well, I may not know
the difference between

00:57.666 --> 00:59.711
a lug bolt and a tire iron,

00:59.885 --> 01:03.237
but I do believe that you just
asked me out on a date, Tim.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.937
Yeah, so...

01:08.111 --> 01:09.765
how about dinner tomorrow night?

01:12.333 --> 01:13.421
Okay.

01:13.595 --> 01:14.596
But it's my treat.

01:14.770 --> 01:15.684
It's the least
I can do.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.164
Deal.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.079
So you're gonna
take me up on that?

01:19.253 --> 01:20.863
It's reverse psychology.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.738
Whoa.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.661
[yelling]

01:41.753 --> 01:42.580
Tim!

01:42.754 --> 01:43.625

01:43.799 --> 01:44.626

[piano plays melody]

03:25.901 --> 03:27.250
Phoebe, what happened?

03:27.424 --> 03:28.773
Paige called and said
you were attacked.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.254
No, I wasn't.
A guy from my class was.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.473
Is he okay?

03:32.647 --> 03:33.735
No.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.563
He's dead.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.217
Oh, God.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.957
It was so weird.

03:39.131 --> 03:42.091
Uh... one second he was
helping me with my flat tire,

03:42.265 --> 03:45.225
and then the next...

03:45.399 --> 03:46.835
And I don't get it.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.793
I mean the demon didn't
even seem interested in me.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.491
He just went right after Tim.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.319
Did you find anything
in The Book?

03:52.493 --> 03:53.624
It was a Raptor Demon.

03:53.798 --> 03:54.756
A hired gun.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.105
Hired by who?

03:56.279 --> 03:57.541
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

03:57.715 --> 04:01.153
Paige is at Magic School
trying to find a lead.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.026
I just don't understand
why he attacked him.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.332
Well, there's got
to be a reason.

04:05.506 --> 04:06.811
How well did
you know him?

04:06.985 --> 04:09.771
Always sat next to each
other in class and...

04:09.945 --> 04:12.687
you know, talked occasionally,
and flirted a bit.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.906
In fact, he asked me
out on a date

04:15.080 --> 04:16.778
for tomorrow night.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.434
It's just my luck, huh?

04:20.608 --> 04:22.610
Phoebe, stop it.

04:22.784 --> 04:23.915
It's not like you're cursed

04:24.089 --> 04:25.439
or something.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.962
We don't know that.
I might be cursed.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.616
Look, we don't even know
what's going on here.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.096
Tim could have been a witch
or another demon.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.577
No, he was definitely
not a demon.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.188
Okay, well, then there's
probably another reason.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.409
I don't know, but what I do know
is it's not your fault.

04:43.021 --> 04:45.197
Look, why don't you call Darryl

04:45.372 --> 04:47.591
and see if he can do
a background check on Tim.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.464
Then maybe you should
go to the morgue

04:50.638 --> 04:52.422
to see if you can get
a premonition from his body.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.815
I really don't want to see him.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.077
What if it's the only way

04:55.251 --> 04:56.905
to find out why he was killed?

04:58.428 --> 04:59.429
Okay.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.476
You keep checking The Book.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.782
Sure.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.615
Ahh!

05:15.053 --> 05:17.882
Impressive.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.103
Most impressive.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.758
But you're gonna learn
to like me yet.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.212
Well, it's about time.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.996
Where's the body?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.129
Why didn't you bring it?

05:47.303 --> 05:49.914
Patience, my old friend.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.177
Have I ever failed
to deliver on a promise?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.440
I don't know.

05:53.614 --> 05:56.573
It has been an eternity
since we...

05:56.747 --> 05:58.836
worked together.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.447
Ah, yes, those
were the days.

06:00.621 --> 06:01.926
The Crusades...

06:02.100 --> 06:04.015
the September Massacres,
the Black Plague.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.234
Good times.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.714
Good times,
good times.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.891
So let's get on
with it already.
No.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.937
No, it's taken me months
to get this far.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.461
I'm not gonna
blow it all now

06:14.635 --> 06:15.549
by moving too quickly.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.464
You gotta understand...

06:17.638 --> 06:21.119
when the dead are involved,
I get a little... excited.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.947
That is exactly why
you'll never become

06:23.121 --> 06:25.602
anything more than
an alchemist.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.299
You're unable to see
the bigger picture.

06:27.474 --> 06:28.779
And you can?

06:28.953 --> 06:32.174
I've studied the sisters.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.915
And with all the knowledge
I've gained,

06:34.089 --> 06:36.004
I'm gonna shake them
to their core,

06:36.178 --> 06:38.485
make them more vulnerable
than they've ever been.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.791
So that's why you had
Phoebe's friend killed.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.099
It seemed a little
petty of you.

06:45.622 --> 06:49.191
But he served a much
greater purpose.

06:49.365 --> 06:54.326
Imagine how upset Phoebe will be
when she realizes he died

06:54.501 --> 06:57.547
just because he knew her.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.637
Imagine how cursed
she will feel.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.423
Do you really think
that's enough

07:03.597 --> 07:04.946
to make them vulnerable?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.817
Of course not.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.472
If I am to get
what I'm after,

07:09.646 --> 07:12.257
I'm going to have
to attack them all--

07:12.432 --> 07:16.174
not as witches,
but as women.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.439
Phoebe, I will meet you
at the morgue,

07:19.613 --> 07:21.136
but I'm telling you,
this is not a good idea.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.530
Are you ready to go?

07:26.141 --> 07:28.273
Sheila, honey.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.362
Darryl...

07:30.537 --> 07:32.452
please don't tell me
you have to work.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.671
We bought these tickets
three months ago.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.194
Listen, I know, I know,

07:36.368 --> 07:38.196
and I am really,
really sorry.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.242
But, look, why don't you
take your friend Nadine?

07:40.416 --> 07:41.765
That's who I took
the last time.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.550
Can't you get somebody
to cover for you?

07:43.724 --> 07:45.726
Not on this one I can't.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.771
It's the sisters,
isn't it?

07:47.945 --> 07:48.816
Yeah.

07:48.990 --> 07:49.947
Are they okay?

07:50.121 --> 07:51.993
Lieutenant,
we need to talk.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.298
It seems a Halliwell
has reported

07:53.473 --> 07:54.604
yet another
suspicious murder.

07:54.778 --> 07:55.692
You know what,
Inspector Sheridan,

07:55.866 --> 07:57.085
you've met my wife Sheila, yeah?

07:57.259 --> 07:59.566
Oh, no, actually.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.002
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.220
I'm surprised
we haven't met before.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.266
We did...

08:04.440 --> 08:06.355
six months ago
at the medal ceremony?

08:09.097 --> 08:12.056
Oh, that must have been
before I got hurt.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.623
Yeah, I've been

08:13.797 --> 08:15.233
having memory problems
since then, so...

08:15.407 --> 08:16.321
Really?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.453
Darryl never mentioned it.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.237
You know what,
we really

08:19.411 --> 08:20.195
gotta be going now.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.936
Date night?

08:22.110 --> 08:23.459
It was.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.069
Listen, I'll call you
tomorrow, okay?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.986
What happened to her?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.075
You don't want to know.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.034
Darryl, what aren't
you telling me?

08:33.208 --> 08:35.819
Look, honey, I really
have to get to Phoebe.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.691
I'm sorry.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.047
Hello!

08:46.221 --> 08:47.178
We're home.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.224
Ah, traffic was horrible.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.660
We should have been home
an hour ago.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.053
Well, we want a
normal life, right?

08:52.227 --> 08:53.620
That means we give up
the cosmic taxi.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.099
Well, that doesn't mean
I gave up the right

08:55.273 --> 08:56.405
to complain about it.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.449
Phoebe!

08:57.624 --> 08:58.929
Paige!

08:59.103 --> 09:00.975
Where do you want
the party supplies?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.542
Put them on the table.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.152
I'm not even really sure
that we're gonna need 'em.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.458
Why not?
Well, I don't know
if it's right

09:06.633 --> 09:07.721
to give Chris
a birthday party

09:07.895 --> 09:09.549
when Phoebe's friend
was just killed.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.289
Well, we can't put
everything on hold

09:11.463 --> 09:12.726
every time
a demon attacks.

09:12.900 --> 09:13.770
Yeah.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.206
Hey.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.078
You guys are just
getting home now?

09:17.252 --> 09:18.949
We started back when you called,
but the freeway was a nightmare.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.777
How's Phoebe?
Not so good.

09:20.951 --> 09:21.778
Is she upstairs?

09:21.952 --> 09:23.345
No, she's at the morgue.

09:23.519 --> 09:24.825
I thought she said
you knew.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.567
How would I know?
I haven't talked to her.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.135
I'm kind of worried
about Phoebe.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.789
Why?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.399
Well, I mean, I know
we've seen a lot of deaths,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.140
but she's taking this one
particularly hard.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.142
I was just talking
to her on the phone

09:38.316 --> 09:40.231
and she thinks
she's cursed.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.059
That's silly.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.887
Well, I know that,

09:44.061 --> 09:45.280
but I'm thinking
if we can figure out

09:45.454 --> 09:46.890
why this guy was killed,

09:47.064 --> 09:49.110
maybe we can prove to her
that she isn't?

09:49.284 --> 09:51.112
Did you find anything out
at Magic School?
No.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.461
And I'm not gonna be able
to go back there either.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.202
I have got to meet Joanna.Joanna?

09:54.376 --> 09:56.421
My new charge--
she's a whitelighter-to-be.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.901
She doesn't know magic
exists yet

09:58.075 --> 09:59.729
and thinks we're just friends.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.470
But the Elders are really
worried about her,

10:01.644 --> 10:02.906
you know, kind of falling
off the path.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.255
So I'm just gonna be there
to guide her

10:04.429 --> 10:05.256
in the right direction.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.041
Then you should go.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.738
The Elders wouldn't worry
unless they had a reason.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.087
Besides, Piper and I are here.
We can help Phoebe.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.523
What about Chris' party?

10:11.698 --> 10:13.613
Uh, I think we're gonna
have to postpone it.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.136
What? No.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.398
No, Phoebe would not
want you to do that.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.617
I know, but...

10:17.791 --> 10:19.053
No, look.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.358
We can make this work.
I know we can.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.056
You keep planning that party.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.623
I'm gonna go meet my charge,
give her a pep talk.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.450
By the time Phoebe's back,
I'll be home.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.105
We can do this.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.719
Mommy wants to teach you
a new word.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.198
It's called "denial."

10:39.203 --> 10:40.640
Let's hurry up
and get out of here.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.642
Sheridan's already
suspicious enough.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.556
Well, I can't really worry
about her right now.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.558
Maybe you should worry.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.648
You know, that memory dust
won't matter anymore if...

10:48.822 --> 10:50.301
if this keeps up.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.955
She's already linked you
to way too many murders.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.609
It's getting harder
and harder to cover.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.350
I know, and I'm
sorry about that.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.613
But she's got nothing.
She's just going off a hunch.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.528
But if we accidentally
trigger her memories,

10:59.702 --> 11:02.270
then everything comes back.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.751
And then that's it.
It's over.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.753
For all of us.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.494
Well, maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.062
What do you mean by that?

11:12.236 --> 11:13.455
Nothing.

11:20.941 --> 11:23.857
You sure you want
to do this?

11:24.031 --> 11:25.336
Yeah.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.252
I mean, I have
to know what happened.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.303
Oh, God!

11:35.477 --> 11:36.478
Maybe we should go.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.916
No.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.266
I have to do this.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.490
DARRYL:
It looks like somebody

11:48.664 --> 11:50.144
was trying to send a message.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.015
What?

11:52.189 --> 11:53.843
Why would you say that?

11:54.017 --> 11:55.758
It's vicious. It's calculated.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.196
I see this all the time.

11:59.370 --> 12:02.939
It's like it makes you think
twice when you see 'em.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.419
Maybe that's the point.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.380
Do demons send messages
like this?

12:09.554 --> 12:12.601
Well, if it is a message,
it's obviously for me.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.387
I gotta go.

12:30.314 --> 12:33.100
Poor Phoebe.
So troubled.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.841
It's only gonna get
worse for her.

12:35.015 --> 12:38.496
Mm...
so many bodies.

12:38.670 --> 12:42.283
It's a shame to
take just one.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.241
Ah, business first,
pleasure later.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.852
Can it be done?

12:46.026 --> 12:47.418
[sniffs]

12:47.592 --> 12:49.290
Rigor hasn't set in yet.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.248
It's barely a challenge.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.773
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.775
Let's get to work.

13:00.431 --> 13:03.478
I'm telling you Paige, it's
the only thing that makes sense.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.088
Tim was killed
because he was with me.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.134
Sweetie, look,
you don't know that for sure.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.701
I mean there has to be some sort
of an explanation, okay.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.226
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.271
Phoebe, listen, we really
really have to go.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.707
When I get home,
we'll figure out

13:15.882 --> 13:17.448
who sent the demon.

13:17.622 --> 13:18.536
You need to get some rest,
okay?.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.147
That would be the best thing

13:20.321 --> 13:21.496
for you right now.

13:21.670 --> 13:22.976
Rest?
How am I supposed to rest

13:23.150 --> 13:24.412
when I am the reason
that Tim is dead?

13:24.586 --> 13:26.196
That's exactly why
you need some sleep,

13:26.370 --> 13:28.155
because you are not
thinking clearly.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.244
Paige, don't talk to me
like I'm crazy!

13:30.418 --> 13:31.767
I was there.
I know what happened.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.813
Okay, fine...

13:33.987 --> 13:36.163
when I get home, we will
figure this out together,

13:36.337 --> 13:38.600
but for now, please, please try
to get some rest.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.907
Take care, okay?

13:42.952 --> 13:46.347
Listen, Phoebe,
don't do this to yourself.

13:46.521 --> 13:47.609
It is not your fault.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.090
There's nothing
you could have done.

13:54.094 --> 13:56.313
Hey, sorry, that was my sister.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.098
I might have to cut this
a little short.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.882
Oh, that's okay.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.275
Karl didn't really want me
coming out tonight anyway.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.581
Oh.
You're still seeing him?

14:03.755 --> 14:06.106
I know what you're gonna say,
Paige, but he's a good guy.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.629
I swear.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.326
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.416
'Cause honestly, I kind
of get a little bit of a...

14:12.590 --> 14:13.765
bad vibe from him.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.942
But you don't know
him like I do.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.683
I just know you've had
a tough time lately,

14:18.858 --> 14:20.903
and I don't want to see you
get hurt by this guy.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.079
I won't. Promise.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.602
Trust me, he's
the only thing

14:24.776 --> 14:26.082
that's really good
in my life right now.

14:26.256 --> 14:27.692
Oh, other than you,
of course.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.390
Well, thank you.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.348
No, really, you've been such
a good friend to me.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.176
I don't know what
I would have done without you

14:33.350 --> 14:34.221
the last few weeks.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.788
Sweetie, here's the thing.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.182
You have an amazing future
ahead of you.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.575
You're just gonna have

14:40.749 --> 14:42.925
to have a little faith.

14:43.099 --> 14:44.144
Joanna.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.192
I thought I told you, I didn't
want you hanging out with her.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.672
What are you doing here?

14:50.846 --> 14:53.153
Getting her away from you.Karl, don't be rude.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.719
Well, you know what,
she's been trying to get
between us since day one.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.808
I know she has.

14:56.983 --> 15:00.421
Look. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.772
I... I'll be right there.

15:10.518 --> 15:13.260
He probably just had a bad day.
That's all.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.609
Yeah.

15:14.783 --> 15:15.827
I'm sure that's what it is.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.307
You know, you don't have

15:17.481 --> 15:18.526
to go with him.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.008
I'll be fine.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.619
I promise.

15:24.793 --> 15:25.925
I'll call you later, okay?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.802
[thunder crashing]

15:48.251 --> 15:49.252
[screaming]

15:49.426 --> 15:50.688
It was your fault.

15:51.602 --> 15:52.690
I died because of you.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.605
Now I'm gonna make you pay!

15:58.479 --> 15:59.915
Phoebe, what's wrong?
What is it?

16:00.089 --> 16:01.438
He's trying to kill me!

16:05.138 --> 16:06.617
Who?

16:16.627 --> 16:18.281
I'm telling you he was there.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.153
And he blamed me
for letting him die.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.155
And you're sure you
didn't just dream this?

16:22.329 --> 16:23.547
Yeah, I'm sure.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.288
How many times do I have
to tell you that?

16:25.462 --> 16:27.116
Well, that's a valid question,

16:27.290 --> 16:29.858
considering Leo and I didn't
see anybody in your room.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.469
That doesn't mean
he wasn't there.

16:32.643 --> 16:35.516
Okay, but isn't it possible that
maybe you were just dreaming?

16:35.690 --> 16:36.778
PAIGE:
You know, maybe

16:36.952 --> 16:38.562
it's your subconscious

16:38.736 --> 16:39.607
because you have been feeling
really guilty lately.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.261
It wasn't a dream.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.045
She might be right.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.004
I, uh... found something
on the undead here in The Book.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.570
What do you mean,
undead like zombies?

16:46.744 --> 16:48.311
According to
The Book,

16:48.485 --> 16:51.010
demonic alchemists have the
ability to control the undead,

16:51.184 --> 16:53.229
but lack the power to
bring them back to life.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.405
They need a, uh...
an upper-level demon for that.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.103
PIPER:
So now we're looking

16:57.277 --> 16:58.974
for two demons?PHOEBE:
Which means Tim will be back

16:59.148 --> 17:00.845
because he wants to make me pay.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.630
Who knows? Maybe I deserve it.

17:02.804 --> 17:03.718
PIPER:
Phoebe, come on.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.633
You can't think like that.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.330
If the demons are behind this
and they're controlling Tim,

17:07.504 --> 17:08.897
they're just trying
to freak you out.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.812
Well, obviously it's working.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.771
Which is exactly why
you need to get back
to business as usual

17:13.945 --> 17:15.164
before you drive yourself crazy.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.774
Why don't you go to work?

17:16.948 --> 17:18.776
I don't want to go to work.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.778
Might not be such a bad idea.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.737
It's a public place.
Nobody's gonna attack you there.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.217
Yeah, and as soon as

17:24.391 --> 17:25.131
we come up
with some sort of a plan,

17:25.305 --> 17:26.436
I'll come and get you.

17:26.610 --> 17:27.785
PIPER:
Come on.
You're not doing

17:27.959 --> 17:29.004
anybody any good like this.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.571
Just get up and go to work.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.834
Okay, but if you find
the alchemist,

17:33.008 --> 17:34.488
you have to come get me.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.578
[phone rings]

17:37.752 --> 17:39.971
It's Joanna.

17:40.146 --> 17:43.410
Now can we cancel
Chris' party?

17:43.584 --> 17:46.630
Before any walking
dead crash it?

17:46.804 --> 17:48.632
I guess we have to.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.026
On the bright side...
he's only one.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.072
He's not gonna
remember it.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.813
We will.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.120
Ah, she just got in a big fight
with her boyfriend.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.556
She's really upset.
I have to go.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.341
PIPER:
A lover's spat?

18:01.515 --> 18:03.299
Is that really something her
whitelighter needs to deal with?

18:03.473 --> 18:05.127
Especially right now?

18:05.301 --> 18:07.260
It's her boyfriend; I get
a really bad vibe from him.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.783
I feel like he's gonna hurt her.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.089
Then you should go.

18:11.394 --> 18:12.874
And we should call Morris

18:13.048 --> 18:14.484
and make sure that

18:14.658 --> 18:16.791
Tim's body is still
in the morgue.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.009
Or not.

18:24.973 --> 18:27.715
You don't need
to keep him like this.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.065
Revive him.

18:30.239 --> 18:33.024
I can control him.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.418
I'll revive him
when I'm ready.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.942
But you barely
even used him.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.771
I had to pull him out
before Piper saw him.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.600
I can't allow the sisters to
figure this out too quickly.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.428
They will in time.

18:45.602 --> 18:46.995
Of course, but by then

18:47.169 --> 18:49.824
they won't be able to ignore
the emotional fallout.

18:49.998 --> 18:54.785
Besides, right now your friend
there will only distract us.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.700
We need to keep our eye
on the prize.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.573
Your prize, not mine.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.227
What if I were
to give you a body

19:01.401 --> 19:04.665
that's been dead
quite a bit longer?

19:04.839 --> 19:06.536
Would that satisfy
your appetite?

19:06.710 --> 19:08.016
Depends.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.931
How long has he been dead?

19:10.105 --> 19:11.976
Four years,
give or take.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.674
Was he embalmed?

19:13.848 --> 19:16.590
Was the casket wood or metal?

19:16.764 --> 19:18.200
Let's find out.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.117
Ah, metal.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.945
What do you know?

19:24.119 --> 19:25.642
Interested?

19:25.816 --> 19:28.471
You know me too well.

19:28.645 --> 19:33.607
But why this body out of all the
wonderful choices in the world?

19:33.781 --> 19:36.000
As I said, I know
the sisters.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.787
This will help remind Phoebe of
the cost of the eternal fight,

19:39.961 --> 19:42.050
of all the innocents
she failed to save.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.705
Well, that's hardly enough

19:44.879 --> 19:46.315
to make all the sisters
doubt themselves.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.318
No, but as Phoebe loses faith
in herself,

19:49.492 --> 19:51.015
she'll spread that feeling
to the other two,

19:51.190 --> 19:52.060
starting with Paige...

19:52.234 --> 19:54.149
who by then will be ripe

19:54.323 --> 19:56.064
for a crisis of faith.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.848
I'll see to that.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.546
You better be sure about this.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.330
Believe me, I am.

20:01.504 --> 20:05.639
The sisters and
The Book of Shadowsare
linked,

20:05.813 --> 20:09.425
always have been.

20:09.599 --> 20:14.952
By weakening them, I'm weakening
The Book'sdefenses too...

20:15.126 --> 20:18.042
enough to make it mine.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.441
Damn it!

20:25.615 --> 20:27.400
I figured you'd come by sooner
or later.

20:27.574 --> 20:30.403
What are you doing here,
Sheridan?

20:30.577 --> 20:32.405
The coroner called
the captain.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.407
Told him Tim Cross'
body was missing.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.757
And that you were
the last one to see it.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.542
So you want to tell me
why you're here?

20:39.716 --> 20:41.588
I got an anonymous tip.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.154
I decided to check it out.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.896
Any chance that that tip
came from a Halliwell?

20:46.070 --> 20:47.202
I said anonymous.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.943
I see.

20:50.423 --> 20:54.905
The coroner also said that you
came by with a woman last night.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.342
Phoebe Halliwell?

20:56.516 --> 20:57.952
She was friends with the victim.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.649
She needed closure.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.999
Well, she certainly must need
a lot of closure,

21:02.173 --> 21:04.175
given the number of murders
that she's been connected to,

21:04.350 --> 21:05.829
several of which include

21:06.003 --> 21:08.702
law enforcement officers:
Trudeau, Rodriguez.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.617
The sisters did not kill them.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.663
Morris...

21:13.837 --> 21:17.754
Darryl... I know that
you're a good cop,

21:17.928 --> 21:19.974
and I can't believe
that you would help killers.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.802
Now I don't know
what these women have on you...

21:21.976 --> 21:23.107
They don't have anything on me.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.457
Then why are you
protecting them?

21:24.631 --> 21:26.241
Do you know what
you're doing to yourself?

21:26.415 --> 21:28.809
To your career?
To your family?

21:28.983 --> 21:30.854
Does your wife even know
the kind of risk that
you're taking?

21:31.028 --> 21:31.942
Leave her out of this.

21:32.116 --> 21:32.987
Then come clean with me.

21:33.161 --> 21:36.295
Tell me what you know.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.862
Maybe I can help you
before it's too late.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.736
Before you force me
to take you down, too.

21:44.651 --> 21:47.218
PAIGE:
Honey, you're gonna be okay.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.090
You're gonna pull
through this.

21:49.264 --> 21:52.398
I'm not.
This always happens.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.748
Just when I think
I've found the right guy,

21:54.922 --> 21:56.402
it all falls apart.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.621
But Karl might not be
the right guy for you.

21:58.795 --> 22:01.842
You might really be better off
without him.

22:02.016 --> 22:06.325
Why? So I can just
be alone forever?

22:06.499 --> 22:08.631
As if my life isn't
bad enough already.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.503
You can't talk like that.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.113
You can't just give up
on yourself.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.333
Says who?

22:14.507 --> 22:16.204
From where I'm sitting,

22:16.378 --> 22:17.336
maybe the world
would be better
off without me.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.077
Now, that is
absolutely not true.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.862
You're gonna have to believe me
on that one.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.646
[cell phone rings]

22:23.820 --> 22:27.171
Now what?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.782
Oh, just give me
a second, okay?

22:30.914 --> 22:35.441
Hey, I thought you said
you could do this without me.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.530
Well, you know, things change.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.096
I just talked to Darryl.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.751
Missing?Tim's body is missing.

22:41.925 --> 22:44.450
Hmm, I guess Phoebe
wasn't dreaming after all.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.626
Okay, I'm gonna get to work
on a vanquishing potion

22:46.800 --> 22:49.063
to get rid of the alchemist,
and hopefully if we do that,

22:49.237 --> 22:52.545
it'll reverse his magic
and Tim can rest in peace.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.112
Well, yeah, but we still don't
know why the alchemist

22:55.286 --> 22:57.114
is even doing this
or who he's working with.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.160
Well, we're just gonna have
to find him,

22:59.334 --> 23:00.901
and make him tell us.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.903
So I need you to go get Phoebe
and bring her home.

23:03.077 --> 23:05.253
I kinda don't want to leave
Joanna right now.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.733
Is it life or death?

23:06.907 --> 23:08.952
Well, this is.No.

23:09.126 --> 23:12.129
But, Paige, the faster
we get rid of the demons,

23:12.303 --> 23:14.175
the faster you can get back
to your charge.

23:14.349 --> 23:17.831
Fine. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.225
Uh... I'm gonna have to go.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.140
I've got a bit of
a family emergency.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.446
What if Karl comes back?

23:24.620 --> 23:26.056
I don't want
to face him alone.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.580
You won't have to, all right?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.277
Just call me.
I'll be here in a second.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.105
But what if you're far away?

23:31.279 --> 23:34.413
If you really need me,
just yell my name loudly.

23:34.587 --> 23:35.501
But...

23:35.675 --> 23:36.980
No "but"s.
It's okay.

23:37.154 --> 23:38.460
All right, you have to trust me.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.810
I'm always watching out for you,
I promise.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.423
Lock the door
behind me.

23:44.597 --> 23:48.296
And if Karl comes by,
do not open the door, all right?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.168
I'll be back as soon as I can.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.530
What's the matter,
Joanna?

24:04.704 --> 24:07.533
I thought you loved being alone
with me.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.056
Karl, how did you get in here?

24:10.927 --> 24:13.234
Magic.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.675
Paige? Is that who
you're trying to call out for?

24:19.849 --> 24:21.938
Well, I'm afraid Paige
has abandoned you.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.724
But if it makes you feel
any better,

24:24.898 --> 24:27.466
I'm sure she'd be very upset
she had to miss this.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.597
[gasping]

24:35.125 --> 24:36.866
Can you send these
priority mail?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.259
Actually, overnight them.

24:38.433 --> 24:39.042
These people need help
right away.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.217
What are they?

24:40.391 --> 24:41.828
Advice to my readers.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.307
Wait, you're answering them
directly now?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.092
You can only print so many
in the paper.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.572
I don't want
to let anybody down.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.443
Also you could send
all my e-mails

24:48.617 --> 24:50.401
so you don't have
to sort through them, okay?

24:50.576 --> 24:51.751
Great, thanks.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.975
Oh! I thought she'd never leave.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.324
Yeah, I'm sorry.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.978
It's just really busy here
today.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.327
These letters don't answer
themselves, you know.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.851
Well, great,
you're feeling better then.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.288
Yeah. And I didn't want
to come in,

25:07.462 --> 25:10.509
but you guys were right;
it's really helped me a lot.

25:10.683 --> 25:11.901
Well, fantastic.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.077
Uh, okay, we should go
because you told me

25:14.251 --> 25:15.949
to come get you
when we have something,

25:16.123 --> 25:17.254
and, uh, we have something.

25:17.428 --> 25:18.952
Uh, can it wait?

25:19.126 --> 25:20.954
Excuse me?

25:21.128 --> 25:23.086
Well, it's just I have
all these letters

25:23.260 --> 25:25.436
that I have to answer,
not to mention e-mails

25:25.611 --> 25:26.568
and phone messages
and faxes.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.265
So?

25:28.439 --> 25:29.745
These people need me.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.138
I can't just let them down,
you know.

25:31.312 --> 25:34.184
I see what's going on here,
missy.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.099
What do you mean
what's going on?

25:36.273 --> 25:37.666
Nothing's going on.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.450
I'm just helping innocents
in need, that's all.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.452
No, you are feeling guilty
about what happened with Tim

25:41.627 --> 25:42.584
and you're overcompensating.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.543
That is ridiculous.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.588
I am not.
I'm just doing my job.

25:46.762 --> 25:47.894
Besides, I thought

25:48.068 --> 25:49.460
I was the one
studying psychology.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.375
Okay, I may not
have studied psychology,

25:51.550 --> 25:54.770
but I have studied you,
and this is classic Phoebe.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.206
You're running away
from your pain.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.817
Honey, you cannot run away
from this.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.036
Well, I can try, can't I?

26:08.305 --> 26:13.049
He was just helping me
with a flat tire; that's all.

26:13.223 --> 26:16.139
He didn't do anything wrong.

26:16.313 --> 26:20.100
He was just... with me.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.582
And how am I supposed
to deal with that?

26:23.756 --> 26:26.628
Well, I think you deal with it

26:26.802 --> 26:28.499
by vanquishing
the demons responsible.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.414
You know, making Tim's death
count for something.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.766
Yeah, well, we don't even know
who's responsible

26:33.940 --> 26:35.637
or why they're doing this.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.639
I'm starting to think
there's only one demon

26:37.813 --> 26:39.946
who could be responsible
for this.

26:41.904 --> 26:46.648
Careful.
Take it easy.

26:46.822 --> 26:49.085
Careful, not so much.

26:50.434 --> 26:54.003
Yes... yes! He's alive!

26:54.177 --> 26:55.744
[grunts]

26:55.918 --> 26:58.617
Welcome back,
Inspector.

26:58.791 --> 27:02.969
Where am I?
What am I doing here?

27:03.143 --> 27:05.536
Beginning your new life.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.713
What's the last thing
you remember?

27:07.887 --> 27:12.282
DEMON:
You've been so brave, Inspector.
Don't ruin it now.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.502
Open the gate! Oh!

27:14.676 --> 27:19.333
A demon... attacked me.
Bit me.

27:19.507 --> 27:22.597
It killed you...
more than four years ago,

27:22.771 --> 27:24.077
but I brought you back.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.427
Webrought you back.

27:26.601 --> 27:27.907
I don't understand.

27:28.081 --> 27:32.259
Well, then let us
help you, my child.

27:33.347 --> 27:35.610
You remember Phoebe Halliwell?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.178
Look, Miss Halliwell,

27:38.352 --> 27:41.181
I think you know more
than you're letting on,

27:41.355 --> 27:42.573
but you're scared.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.271
You're afraid that
if I find out the truth,

27:44.445 --> 27:45.315
you're gonna get
in trouble.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.143
Am I right?

27:47.317 --> 27:51.278
I wish I could help you,
but I can't... but I can't.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.889
She could have
warned you,
saved you.

27:54.063 --> 27:56.326
Think of all that she cost you.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.414
A wife,

27:57.588 --> 27:59.765
a family.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.941
You were just doing your job.

28:02.115 --> 28:05.422
It was quite selfish
of her, really.

28:05.596 --> 28:06.946
She lived on
while they suffered,

28:07.120 --> 28:08.904
grieving over your death.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.211
It's time to even the score.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.082
[groans]

28:16.390 --> 28:18.218
Zankou?

28:18.392 --> 28:20.437
Well, he's certainly powerful
enough to help the alchemist.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.092
And he knows us well enough
to try something like this.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.660
Maybe he's finally
going after us.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.270
Yeah, but why kill
an innocent?

28:27.444 --> 28:29.272
Why not just
come after me?

28:29.446 --> 28:31.144
Maybe he's trying
to break you down.

28:31.318 --> 28:34.277
I'm beginning to like it better
when I thought I was cursed.

28:34.451 --> 28:35.844
And you know you're not, right?

28:36.018 --> 28:37.585
Right, I do... now.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.282
I should have just listened
to you yesterday.

28:39.456 --> 28:40.719
What do you mean?

28:40.893 --> 28:42.503
Yeah, the talk we had
in the attic.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.551
Wait. Was that not you?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.205
Well, it was
probably Zankou.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.859
He shape-shifted
into one of us before.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.166
Okay, well, how do I
know this is you now?

28:53.340 --> 28:55.385
How do I know you're
not Zankou right now?

28:55.559 --> 28:56.473
Because I'm not.

28:56.647 --> 28:57.561
Prove it.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.260
Jake Singer... back seat,

29:00.434 --> 29:01.914
tenth grade,
can Zankou

29:02.088 --> 29:03.350
tell you all about that?

29:03.524 --> 29:04.743
I think I'm
losing my mind.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.483
Where are you going?

29:06.657 --> 29:08.268
To The Bookto find a way
to vanquish Zankou

29:08.442 --> 29:10.313
before I really do lose my mind.

29:10.487 --> 29:13.229
Ah, what are we
going to do about her?

29:13.403 --> 29:16.711
The only thing we can do:
help her vanquish Zankou.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.452
Okay, well,
then I guess

29:18.626 --> 29:19.888
we won't be needing
that potion.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.369
Actually, we need
to get to the alchemist

29:22.543 --> 29:24.719
who can lead us to Zankou,
and then hopefully,

29:24.893 --> 29:26.329
when we get rid
of both of them,

29:26.503 --> 29:29.942
Phoebe will be able
to sleep again.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.944
Where's Phoebe going?

29:32.118 --> 29:33.293
Probably to a mental
institution.

29:33.467 --> 29:34.816
Did you put the kids down
for their nap?

29:34.990 --> 29:37.471
Yes. And I started calling
all our friends

29:37.645 --> 29:39.081
to cancel Chris' party.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.083
Oh, I'm sorry you guys
had to do that.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.781
Next year,
he'll have two.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.391
Well, I have

29:44.565 --> 29:45.871
to go check on Joanna,
make sure she's okay.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.220
Okay, hurry back.

29:47.394 --> 29:48.917
I will.

29:51.615 --> 29:52.965
[knocking]

29:53.139 --> 29:55.097
Hey, Joanna, it's me, Paige.
I'm back.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.620
[knocking]

29:56.795 --> 29:59.972
Joanna, open up. You okay?

30:02.322 --> 30:04.150
I told you to keep
the door locked.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.022
Oh, God.

30:07.196 --> 30:08.894
[Paige sighs]

30:13.289 --> 30:17.772
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

30:27.564 --> 30:30.089
Lieutenant, we've
been waiting for you.

30:31.351 --> 30:32.743
Sheila.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.267
What are you doing here?

30:34.441 --> 30:36.138
What's wrong?

30:36.312 --> 30:37.705
I called her.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.881
I thought that someone
should fill her in.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.230
SHEILA:
And I'm glad she did.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.841
At least somebody's
telling me

30:43.015 --> 30:44.320
what's going on
around here.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.018
You're way out of line
on this one, Inspector.

30:46.192 --> 30:46.845
Am I?

30:48.803 --> 30:50.457
I'll leave you two alone
to talk.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.116
What did she tell you?

30:57.290 --> 31:00.423
She said you could lose your job
or go to prison.

31:00.597 --> 31:03.078
Prison, Darryl.
How could you hide this from me?

31:03.252 --> 31:04.601
Sheila, I'm trying
to protect you.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.168
I don't want to be protected.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.474
I want to know
we're not going to lose you.

31:07.648 --> 31:09.084
You are not about to lose me!
You...

31:09.258 --> 31:10.912
You don't know that!

31:12.566 --> 31:14.524
Did you say anything
to her about them?

31:14.698 --> 31:16.483
Don't worry.
I kept their secret.

31:16.657 --> 31:19.312
I always will, no
matter what happens.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.618
But come on, Darryl.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.664
I know you had
to struggle with this--

31:23.838 --> 31:25.144
with how far you can go
to help the sisters.

31:25.318 --> 31:26.928
Baby, I'm so past that.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.930
No, you're not.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.366
How can you be?

31:30.540 --> 31:32.978
I used to stay up late nights

31:33.152 --> 31:34.805
worrying whether you were going
to come home at night

31:34.980 --> 31:36.590
because of all the criminals
out there.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.200
That is nothing compared to what
I have to worry about now.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.246
Sheila, look, this is not
the time or the place.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.161
No? When is the time?

31:42.335 --> 31:44.772
When I bring our kids to jail
to see you, or to your funeral?

31:46.600 --> 31:49.429
This is not your fight, Darryl.
It's theirs.

31:49.603 --> 31:52.040
[cell phone rings]

31:55.261 --> 31:57.089
That's them, isn't it?

31:58.786 --> 32:01.702
Please don't answer that,
Darryl. I'm begging you.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.663
Come on, Darryl.
Pick up the phone.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.148
Sheila, baby,
they are in trouble.

32:13.322 --> 32:16.108
So are we.

32:17.761 --> 32:20.677
It's our family or theirs.

32:22.679 --> 32:25.639
Darryl's not answering.

32:25.813 --> 32:28.511
How can he not answer?

32:28.685 --> 32:30.470
I'm beginning to think
he can't help anyway.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.080
Well, I have to call
the police, okay?

32:32.254 --> 32:34.691
Because I can't let Karl
just get away with this.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.737
I should have been there
with her.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.391
I should not
have left her alone.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.088
You can't
blame yourself.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.961
You have other responsibilities
you can't ignore either.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.485
But you said I'm supposed
to be able to sense my charges,

32:45.659 --> 32:47.226
and I didn't sense anything.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.792
So can you tell me what the hell
is wrong with me?!

32:48.967 --> 32:51.447
Nothing.
Nothing is wrong with you.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.014
It takes time to form the bond

32:53.188 --> 32:54.668
between charges
and whitelighters, that's all.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.278
Is it? That's not good enough
because I promised her

32:56.452 --> 32:58.846
that I was going to be there,
and I failed.

32:59.020 --> 32:59.978
No, you didn't,
sweetie.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.805
I think Zankou
wants you

33:01.980 --> 33:03.068
to think you did.

33:03.242 --> 33:03.938
Zankou?

33:04.112 --> 33:05.722
It has to be him.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.681
First, Phoebe's friend,
and now her charge.

33:07.855 --> 33:08.769
That can't be a coincidence.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.424
What? You think Karl
is working with Zankou?

33:11.598 --> 33:12.599
I think he isZankou.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.427
Think about it.

33:14.601 --> 33:15.994
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.083
He's targeting the people
in our lives.

33:18.257 --> 33:20.259
Well, what good would that do?

33:20.433 --> 33:21.825
I don't know.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.218
Maybe, if he thinks
we're rattled enough,

33:23.392 --> 33:24.698
we'll be vulnerable.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.047
But no one in your life
has been targeted.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.831
No, not yet,
but that's why you need

33:28.006 --> 33:29.398
to get Leo and the boys
to Magic School

33:29.572 --> 33:30.530
right away.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.445
Look, we've been
through this.

33:32.619 --> 33:33.968
I'm not going to run and hide
every time a demon attacks.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.884
Leo, this is not
just another demon,

33:37.058 --> 33:39.191
and this is not
about you hiding.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.106
This is about the
safety of our family.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.108
You need to go now.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.285
All right.

33:46.459 --> 33:47.764
I'll get the boys.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.115
Piper.

33:50.289 --> 33:51.768
What about the other people
in your life?

33:51.942 --> 33:53.509
The best way
to protect them

33:53.683 --> 33:56.469
is to get to Zankou,
and for that, we need Phoebe.

34:06.914 --> 34:09.090
Piper? Paige?

34:09.264 --> 34:10.439
Guess again.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.226
Who are you?

34:14.400 --> 34:15.227
What do you want?

34:15.401 --> 34:16.619
What you took from me!

34:16.793 --> 34:17.794
My life!

34:18.882 --> 34:20.623
What's the matter?

34:20.797 --> 34:21.842
Don't you recognize me?

34:22.016 --> 34:23.713
Inspector Davidson?

34:23.887 --> 34:24.845
In the flesh.

34:25.019 --> 34:27.108
Or what's left of it.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.806
Oh, no, not again.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.287
Hold on. Hold on.

34:32.461 --> 34:33.723
I want to talk to you.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.116
I think you owe me
that much.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.988
Who did this to you? Zankou?

34:38.163 --> 34:40.165
I didn't get a name.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.602
But it was obviously someone
who knows you pretty damn well.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.125
Don't worry.

34:44.299 --> 34:46.649
Death's not so bad.

34:46.823 --> 34:48.129
I think you're going to like it.

34:48.303 --> 34:49.261
I tried to save you.

34:49.435 --> 34:50.566
You should have tried harder!

34:50.740 --> 34:51.915
I couldn't.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.221
The angel of death
was after you.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.049
At the end.

34:55.223 --> 34:56.398
See, but you're forgetting
about all the months before,

34:56.572 --> 34:57.704
about all those times
I asked you

34:57.878 --> 34:59.184
to come clean with me.

34:59.358 --> 35:00.924
If you told me the truth
just once!

35:01.099 --> 35:02.361
I couldn't.

35:02.535 --> 35:03.362
I'm sorry.

35:03.536 --> 35:04.711
Did you go to my funeral?

35:04.885 --> 35:07.670
Did you see my wife, my kids?

35:07.844 --> 35:09.019
They're growing up

35:09.194 --> 35:10.891
without a father
because of you.

35:11.065 --> 35:12.719
I am so sorry.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.112
Oh, I bet you are now.

35:14.286 --> 35:15.548
And you're going
to be even more sorry

35:15.722 --> 35:17.419
when I'm through with you.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.899
No.

35:19.073 --> 35:20.161
Paige!

35:20.335 --> 35:21.249
Piper!

35:21.423 --> 35:22.772
Piper! Piper!

35:22.946 --> 35:23.730
He's right behind me.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.036
Get him. Get him.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.605
Phoebe,
there's no one there.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.912
He was there.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.522
I swear it.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.785
Who?

35:35.959 --> 35:37.918
Inspector Davidson.

35:38.092 --> 35:41.008
Reece Davidson?

35:41.182 --> 35:42.705
He died four years ago.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.457
Aah.

36:03.596 --> 36:04.553
Aah!

36:05.598 --> 36:07.643
Getting closer.

36:10.298 --> 36:14.084
I guess I'm gonna have
to kick things up a notch.

36:21.918 --> 36:22.832
It's clear.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.747
No one dead or undead.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.096
You sure?

36:26.271 --> 36:28.447
Pretty sure,
unless they're invisible.

36:28.621 --> 36:29.883
What, you think
they could be invisible?

36:30.057 --> 36:31.580
No. Come on.

36:31.754 --> 36:33.582
We got to find the alchemist
and hopefully Zankou.

36:33.756 --> 36:34.931
Paige!

36:36.019 --> 36:37.586
What? I was just getting
Leo and the boys

36:37.760 --> 36:39.022
settled in at Magic School.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.807
I need you to see
if you can find Joanna...

36:40.981 --> 36:42.374
quickly.
!
PAIGE:
I thought I told you.

36:42.548 --> 36:43.418
She's dead.

36:43.592 --> 36:44.941
Yeah, not for long.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.595
Wait, you think Joanna's
going to come back, too?

36:46.769 --> 36:47.944
I'm counting on it.

36:48.118 --> 36:50.208
So you need to see
if you can sense her.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.429
PIPER:
Anything?

36:54.603 --> 36:57.650
No, but Leo said our bond
hadn't fully formed yet.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.739
Okay, then we're going
to have to scry for her

36:59.913 --> 37:01.871
the old-fashioned way.

37:02.045 --> 37:04.091
Do you think she's even
going to turn into a zombie?

37:04.265 --> 37:05.962
It fits the pattern.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.617
And trust me, you don't want
to be surprised once it happens.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.315
Just concentrate;
she was your charge.

37:10.489 --> 37:13.187
If anybody can
find her, you can.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.320
You know, I'd really
rather not find her,

37:15.494 --> 37:17.322
considering I'm the
reason she's dead.

37:17.496 --> 37:18.714
Join the club.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.368
Look, the faster
we find Joanna's body,

37:20.542 --> 37:22.414
we'll find the alchemist
and hopefully Zankou

37:22.588 --> 37:24.590
before he kills anybody
else in our lives.

37:25.155 --> 37:25.982
Found her.

37:26.156 --> 37:28.289
Cemetery.

37:28.942 --> 37:30.944
Not good, never good.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.083
Oh, God,
that's her.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.825
Miss me?

37:42.999 --> 37:44.131
[gasps]

37:44.305 --> 37:45.959
Looks like it's time
for payback.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.440
Look, we don't want
to hurt you.

37:48.614 --> 37:49.963
It's a little late for that.

37:50.137 --> 37:53.140
Paige, maybe you should
orb us out of here.

37:53.314 --> 37:54.968
No, the alchemist has to be
around here somewhere.

37:55.142 --> 37:55.925
I see my reputation

37:56.099 --> 37:57.927
precedes me.

37:58.101 --> 38:01.104
But if you want to get to me,
you have to get through them.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.281
[sinister laughing]

38:05.805 --> 38:08.068
Those are all
Innocents I've lost.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.896
That's right.

38:10.070 --> 38:12.290
You three have done a hell
of a lot of damage in your time.

38:13.421 --> 38:16.424
Seriously, have you done
any good at all?!

38:16.598 --> 38:18.687
[Phoebe screams]

38:20.167 --> 38:22.778
Phoebe! Ugh.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.476
Friend, my ass.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.130
[laughs]

38:29.829 --> 38:31.352
ALCHEMIST:
Yes.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.180
Yes, my children.

38:33.354 --> 38:34.181
Good.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.314
[all grunting]

38:48.151 --> 38:49.065
Don't make me do this.

38:49.239 --> 38:50.415
PHOEBE:
Stop!

38:55.376 --> 38:58.597
God help us.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.209
[screaming]

39:02.383 --> 39:03.602
No!

39:15.135 --> 39:17.050
It's okay.
You had to.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.138
We all had to.

39:18.312 --> 39:19.444
You...

39:19.618 --> 39:21.402
He told me you wouldn't.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.273
You couldn't.
I lied.

39:26.189 --> 39:27.190
[screams]

39:28.453 --> 39:30.106
He served his purpose.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.673
Why would you do that?

39:32.805 --> 39:34.981
What do you have to gain?

39:35.155 --> 39:37.418
You'll soon find out.

39:48.429 --> 39:49.474
Detective Sheridan.

39:49.648 --> 39:50.649
You got a minute?

39:53.826 --> 39:55.480
First of all, you had no right.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.220
I had every right.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.092
We're cops; crimes
are being committed,

39:59.266 --> 40:00.267
and that gives me the right.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.051
Look, as I said before,

40:02.225 --> 40:04.967
you are either with me on this
or you're against me.

40:06.099 --> 40:07.405
I'm taking
some vacation time...

40:08.754 --> 40:09.755
...to be with my family.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.148
That's curious timing.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.847
I don't like being put
in this position.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.632
You put yourself
in this position, Lieutenant.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.155
You're not gonna be able
to take them down.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.985
They won't let you.

40:23.159 --> 40:25.423
What, is that supposed
to be some kind of a threat?

40:25.597 --> 40:26.728
It's a friendly warning.

40:27.903 --> 40:28.817
And what they're doing

40:28.991 --> 40:31.124
and what they're all about,

40:31.298 --> 40:32.430
it's above reproach.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.306
I wouldn't mess with them
if I were you.

40:42.570 --> 40:43.789
Have a nice vacation.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.539
[sighs]

40:54.713 --> 40:56.932
Well, why can't we try
to vanquish Zankou

40:57.106 --> 40:58.586
the same way we
vanquished the Source?

40:58.760 --> 40:59.935
He'll be ready for that.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.328
That's why we need
something new.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.287
Why did he vanquish
the alchemist himself?

41:04.462 --> 41:05.724
I don't know.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.203
Maybe there's something
in The Book.

41:07.377 --> 41:08.988
Where is The Book?

41:12.165 --> 41:13.819
Oh... Zankou.

41:13.993 --> 41:15.298
Yeah, but how did he get it?

41:15.473 --> 41:17.997
It doesn't matter.
He's got it now.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.478
The question is: what's
he going to do with it?

41:26.266 --> 41:28.964
[laughing]

41:29.138 --> 41:30.966
Now the fun really begins.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.100
[laughing]
