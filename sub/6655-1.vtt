04:48.814 --> 04:51.067
Starina won't go on.
She's a-still in her robe.

04:51.233 --> 04:52.234
Damn!

04:52.401 --> 04:54.449
I don't know what happened.

04:54.695 --> 04:58.199
Go upstairs. Try to get her ready.
I'll be right up. Go!

She won't.

You got to get dressed for me.

05:12.462 --> 05:13.554
No, Agador.

05:13.714 --> 05:18.185
Victoria Page will not dance
the Dance of the Red Shoes tonight.

05:18.343 --> 05:19.344
Or any other night.

05:19.511 --> 05:21.809
How 'bout just your stockings, okay?

05:22.097 --> 05:23.770
Victoria Page is dead.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.523
But watch how nice
I'm gonna put it for you.

05:26.685 --> 05:27.777
You know how she died?

05:27.936 --> 05:30.906
Alone... weeping for her lover.

05:32.357 --> 05:34.485
Darling, have you eaten?
You look haggard.

05:35.193 --> 05:37.787
Please! You gotta help me a little.

05:38.113 --> 05:39.990
- What is this?
- Supplements.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.202
I bought them for Armand, but...

05:44.244 --> 05:45.746
...that's all over now.

05:46.455 --> 05:48.173
Okay.

05:56.673 --> 05:57.674
Albert!

05:57.841 --> 05:59.218
Agh!

06:00.635 --> 06:02.182
Where are you?
Albert, come on!

06:02.345 --> 06:04.473
- Open up, Albert, baby.
- Get out!

06:04.639 --> 06:07.142
- Open it, Albert!
- Go away!

06:07.309 --> 06:09.983
I don't want him to see me.
I'm hideous!

06:16.067 --> 06:17.068
Fuck!

06:17.235 --> 06:20.489

Are you trying to ruin me?

06:30.999 --> 06:33.218
Don't look at me.
I'm hideous!

06:33.418 --> 06:36.217
Hideous! Fat and hideous!

06:36.379 --> 06:38.256
Agador, I'm in such pain.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.302
I know, honey. It's gonna pass.

06:41.468 --> 06:44.187
No! It will never pass.
I hate my life.

06:44.346 --> 06:47.441
Are you crazy?
It's packed out there!

06:47.599 --> 06:50.398
That's all I am to you...
a meal ticket.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.654
- I can't stand this.
- Forget about my feelings.

06:52.813 --> 06:56.738
Forget about my suffering.
It's just about your show.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.369
Not even our show.
Your show.

06:59.528 --> 07:02.031
I want a palimony agreement, now.

07:02.197 --> 07:05.201
I don't have one on me.
Is tomorrow okay?

07:05.367 --> 07:07.711
- Don't use that tone to me.
- What tone?

07:07.869 --> 07:12.545
That sarcastic tone that implies you
know everything because you're a man,

07:12.707 --> 07:14.254
and I know nothing
because I'm a woman.

07:14.417 --> 07:17.466
- You're not a woman.
- Oh, you bastard!

07:18.964 --> 07:21.092
Everybody, take it easy.

07:21.258 --> 07:23.727
Whatever I am, he made me.

07:23.885 --> 07:27.560
I was adorable once,
young and full of hope.

07:27.722 --> 07:31.022
Now, look at me.
I'm this short,

07:31.184 --> 07:35.155
fat, insecure,
middle-aged thing!

07:35.313 --> 07:36.690
I made you short?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.109
(SCREAMS)

07:39.860 --> 07:41.828
What do I do?
The number is nearly over.

07:41.987 --> 07:43.455
Do I send Carmen on for Starina?

07:44.739 --> 07:47.117
We have no choice. Yes.

07:47.284 --> 07:49.503
Not Carmen!
How dare you?

07:49.661 --> 07:51.584
- (ARMAND) Do it!
- (ALBERT) No! No!

07:51.746 --> 07:52.998
- Cyril, go.
- Please.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.629
I will go on. The people
have come to see Starina.

07:57.794 --> 08:00.422
Starina will not disappoint them,
even in this state.

08:00.589 --> 08:05.390
Put on the mambo number. Have Beatrice
and Dante get the staircase ready.

08:06.177 --> 08:07.850
- My hands are shaking.
- That's okay.

08:08.013 --> 08:10.186
Agador, I need
some Pirin tablets.

08:10.348 --> 08:12.396
- What are you taking?
- Nothing.

08:12.559 --> 08:15.608
Just one, okay?
One before the show,

08:15.770 --> 08:18.649
and one after.
No more, so don't ask.

08:18.815 --> 08:21.568
Thank you, my darling Agador.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.408
(AGADOR) I'm gonna put
this here for you.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.572
(ARMAND) Breathe.
Ignore the bad things.

08:25.739 --> 08:30.245
This room is so crowded. Can I have
a moment to myself to prepare?

08:30.410 --> 08:32.287
(AGADOR) Let's leave her.
Come on.

08:40.294 --> 08:43.219
Why are you giving him drugs?
What the hell are Pirin tablets?

08:43.381 --> 08:46.430
Aspirin, with the "A" and "S"
scraped off.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.267
- What a brilliant idea.
- I know.

08:51.348 --> 08:54.773
I don't believe it!
You're shaving your chest now?

08:54.935 --> 08:57.108
I didn't have time to wax.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.284
Indifference is the most
awful thing in the world.

09:02.901 --> 09:06.997
I've done everything I could
to make myself attractive for you.

09:07.614 --> 09:11.539
I've lost and gained over
a hundred pounds in the last year.

09:12.535 --> 09:17.837
I've yo-yoed from a 16
to a 10 to a 16, and...

09:17.999 --> 09:19.546
...you've never said a word.

09:19.709 --> 09:24.055
Not one hint of encouragement,
not one scrap of validation.

09:25.382 --> 09:28.807
If not for the Pirin tablets,
I couldn't go on.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.688
If you don't finish making up,
I'll kill myself.

09:34.099 --> 09:35.567
You don't love me anymore.

09:35.725 --> 09:37.272
Oh, shit.

09:37.435 --> 09:39.563
- There's a man in your life.
- What?

09:39.729 --> 09:40.730
I sense it.

09:40.897 --> 09:43.946
And I saw a bottle of white wine,

09:44.109 --> 09:46.407
chilling in the refrigerator.

09:47.070 --> 09:48.868
I only drink red.

09:49.030 --> 09:50.327
And so do you.

09:55.245 --> 09:56.462
There's no man.

09:56.621 --> 09:59.966
I'm switching to white
because red has tannins.

10:00.125 --> 10:05.052
Now there are 150 people out there,
half of them Kennedys, waiting for you.

10:05.213 --> 10:08.934
Waiting to applaud you.
To applaud the great Starina.

10:09.092 --> 10:10.810
Tannins?!

10:10.969 --> 10:13.939
- What do you do while I'm on stage?
- Nothing. I lie here.

10:14.097 --> 10:19.149
Where do you go while I'm killing
myself on stage? I know that look.

10:19.310 --> 10:21.813
Go ahead, hit me. Go on.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.779
That's what you want to do.
Do it. Hit me.

10:24.941 --> 10:26.784

As you see, I've just gotten back
from safari. I picked up a new muff.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.911
Look, it comes with accessories.

11:57.742 --> 12:00.461
Don't look at me like that.
I didn't kill him.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.622
He died and left me everything.

Hello.
What do you think?

13:04.893 --> 13:07.396
You look like Lucy's stunt double.

13:07.562 --> 13:09.906
I'm a combination of Lucy and Ricky.

13:10.064 --> 13:13.443
And it's terrifying.
Get out the white wine,

13:13.610 --> 13:16.830
chill two glasses
and take the night off.

13:17.947 --> 13:20.575
Why you talk to me
like I'm your servant?

13:20.742 --> 13:22.915
Because you're
our faithful houseman.

13:23.077 --> 13:25.956
My father was the
shaman of his tribe,

13:26.122 --> 13:28.500
my mother was the high priestess.

13:28.666 --> 13:30.293
Then why did they
move to New Jersey?

13:30.460 --> 13:34.510
I don't know. They so stupid.
They want me to have a career.

13:34.672 --> 13:39.143
Hello? A career? When you gonna
let me audition for you again?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.270
When you have talent.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.523
Now take off the wig
or I'll tell Albert you wore it.

13:43.723 --> 13:47.899
You do that, I'm gonna tell him you're
seeing someone while he's on stage.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.273
I have two words for you: Green Card.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.484
Now go! And leave
the front door unlocked.

13:54.651 --> 13:57.450
You're such a beast to everybody.

13:58.321 --> 13:59.743
Come on, Gloria.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.529
Hey.

14:44.659 --> 14:46.787
You keep getting better looking.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.751
Thank you. So do you.

14:48.913 --> 14:51.041
Oh, no. Really?

14:52.166 --> 14:54.134
I feel bloated.

14:56.546 --> 14:58.640
- You think I look good?
- You look great.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.220
That's very sweet.

15:02.885 --> 15:05.638
I'm glad you cut your hair.

15:08.016 --> 15:09.609
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

15:09.767 --> 15:10.814
Something to drink?

15:10.977 --> 15:14.902
- Beer, if you have it.
- I do not. Talk about bloat.

15:16.024 --> 15:17.071
White wine.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.697
Swell.

15:19.944 --> 15:22.413
- How long has Albert been on?
- He just went on.

15:24.449 --> 15:26.497
I gave Agador the night off.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.377
So we're all alone.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.791
As requested.

15:34.584 --> 15:36.632
Since when do you like beer?

15:38.713 --> 15:40.715
So, I have something to tell you.

15:40.882 --> 15:44.056
But I don't want you
to get how you get.

15:44.594 --> 15:45.641
Oh, God.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.432
I'm getting married.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.735
I didn't want to tell you
over the phone.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.693
It's a girl.
I met her at school.

15:59.859 --> 16:03.830
It's this wonderful...
Are you upset?

16:03.988 --> 16:05.456
Let me tell you why.

16:06.783 --> 16:08.456
First, you're only 20.

16:08.618 --> 16:10.871
Pop, I know I'm young.

16:11.037 --> 16:16.464
But... you've always said I was
a very level-headed guy. And I am.

16:16.626 --> 16:21.097
I have job offers, I know what I want.
And I have an incredible role model.

16:21.255 --> 16:22.427
- Oh, please.
- It's true.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.309
I'm the only guy in my fraternity
who isn't from a broken home.

16:25.468 --> 16:27.766
Stop flattering me.
It's cheap.

16:32.975 --> 16:34.227
Is it all right, Dad?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.112
Does it matter?

16:36.270 --> 16:38.364
Of course it does.

16:38.523 --> 16:41.743
Say it's okay, before Albert
arrives and starts screaming.

16:42.985 --> 16:44.987
I can't. And I won't.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.747
This is too crazy.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.581
You do this, you're on your own.
Got that, sport?

16:50.743 --> 16:53.622
Don't come back,
don't ask me for anything.

16:53.788 --> 16:55.540
- I want nothing to do with it.
- Okay.

16:55.706 --> 16:57.299
- If that's how you feel.
- I do.

16:57.458 --> 17:00.837
- Fine. Goodbye, Pop.
- Goodbye, son.

17:03.881 --> 17:06.599
- You called my bluff.
- It was good.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.851
- Really?
- Not bad.

17:08.010 --> 17:09.512
I got backed off on a little bit.

17:09.679 --> 17:11.727
Tell me it's all right.

17:13.641 --> 17:18.317
It's all right. I always dreamed you
would. Just not so soon.

17:19.063 --> 17:21.987
Come on. Drop your bags,
stay a while.

17:26.069 --> 17:28.323
Let's drink a toast
to this catastrophe.

17:28.489 --> 17:29.490
I'm kidding.

17:30.992 --> 17:32.744
It's all right.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.038
What's the young lady's name?

17:35.204 --> 17:36.501
Barbara.

17:36.831 --> 17:38.674
Are you crazy? Forget it.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.756
Married? You're not even 18!

17:40.918 --> 17:43.592
Who is this boy, Barbie?
When did you last see him?

17:43.754 --> 17:48.510
Don't call me Barbie. Today at two.
We've been sleeping together for a year.

17:48.676 --> 17:51.475
Oh, God! Has he been tested?

17:51.637 --> 17:54.265
- Oh, Kevin!
- Yes, and so have I.

17:56.601 --> 17:59.354
This has to wait until after the
election.

17:59.520 --> 18:04.572
Where does the young man come from,
Barbie... ra? Who is his father?

18:05.693 --> 18:10.620
His father is in the arts.
He's on the Council of Cultural Arts.

18:10.781 --> 18:12.374
Did they fund the
Mapplethorpe exhibit?

18:12.533 --> 18:17.164
No! Goodness, no.
He's a cultural attache to Greece.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.832
Really?

18:18.998 --> 18:20.625
What the hell is that?

18:22.210 --> 18:26.716
That's kind of a diplomatic post.
It's a sort of an ambassador.

18:26.881 --> 18:28.883
What does the mother do?

18:29.050 --> 18:30.302
She's a housewife.

18:30.468 --> 18:33.267
That's so refreshing,
isn't it, Kevin?

18:33.429 --> 18:34.931
I can't talk about this now.

18:35.097 --> 18:36.314
(TELEPHONE)

18:37.934 --> 18:39.311
- Hello.
<i>- You all right?</i>

18:39.477 --> 18:42.777
Yes. I just told them.

18:42.939 --> 18:45.192
<i>Me, too. And my father is</i>

18:45.358 --> 18:49.909
very excited. He's raising his glass
to toast us right now.

18:50.071 --> 18:53.075
I'm going to put him on.
Yes. Take it.

18:53.241 --> 18:56.085
- You said his parents were in Greece.
- Dad, get off the phone!

18:56.244 --> 18:57.416
Take it.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.960
<i>Hello, Barbara.</i>

19:00.122 --> 19:01.669
Here's to your future.

19:01.832 --> 19:05.086
Shit! No, dear,
that was not my toast.

19:05.253 --> 19:07.381
I broke my glass. I'm sorry.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.969
<i>That's okay.</i>

19:09.131 --> 19:12.351
It was nice talking to you.
We'll talk again soon.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.262
How dare you eavesdrop?!

19:14.428 --> 19:16.681
- You said his parents were in Greece.
- They are.

19:16.847 --> 19:22.069
You saw this boy at two o'clock today and
now he's in Greece with his parents?

19:22.228 --> 19:23.855
No.

19:25.898 --> 19:26.899
Greece?

19:28.442 --> 19:30.536
They're back for the winter.

19:30.695 --> 19:33.164
They're at their home in South Beach.

19:33.322 --> 19:34.699
Is that like Palm Beach?

19:34.865 --> 19:39.416
It's close. It's about two minutes
from where Jeb Bush lives.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.253
Really?

19:59.515 --> 20:00.562
Ah-ha!

20:00.725 --> 20:02.443
- Wait.
- Who is he?

20:02.602 --> 20:05.025
Who? Where's your little chippie?

20:05.187 --> 20:08.282
Will you stop screaming?
It's Val.

20:09.025 --> 20:10.322
Val?

20:11.319 --> 20:13.868
He's asleep in his room
if you don't believe me.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.118
Why didn't you tell me?

20:18.284 --> 20:19.877
Surprise.

21:01.952 --> 21:04.876
- (WOMAN) Mornin', Albert.
- Good morning!

21:08.876 --> 21:10.093
What beautiful flowers!

21:10.252 --> 21:13.256
- (WOMAN) Morning, Albert.
- Good morning.

21:15.508 --> 21:19.263
We have nice, fresh lobster
this morning, Albert.

21:20.179 --> 21:24.275
No, thank you, Mr. Lopez.
Not today. The piglet is home.

21:25.643 --> 21:27.111
You want the cake delivered?

21:27.269 --> 21:32.025
Yes, please. And remember to write
"To my Piglet, from his Auntie" on it.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.192
You got it.

21:33.359 --> 21:37.455
Thank you, Mr. Boynton.
I want to get back before he wakes up.

21:37.613 --> 21:39.911
I'll just try this sample.

21:40.074 --> 21:41.747
Chocolate schnecken.

21:45.079 --> 21:47.047
A triumph. Well, bye-bye.

21:48.374 --> 21:53.255
Perhaps one more schnecken. Do you
mind? When the schnecken beckons...

21:55.506 --> 21:57.133
- Good morning.
- Not yet.

22:01.262 --> 22:02.730
What is this, sludge?

22:02.888 --> 22:05.767
Yes. I thought it would make
a nice change from coffee.

22:07.101 --> 22:10.321
Why don't you tell me
Val was coming, you bad man?

22:10.479 --> 22:13.107
I would not have been
so sassy to you.

22:13.274 --> 22:15.322
Will you put some clothes on?

22:15.484 --> 22:17.828
Why don't you let me
be in the show?

22:17.987 --> 22:20.661
Are you afraid
of my Guatemalanness?

22:20.823 --> 22:21.824
Your what?

22:21.991 --> 22:24.369
My Guatemalanness.
My natural heat.

22:24.535 --> 22:26.287
You're afraid I'm too primitive

22:26.454 --> 22:30.004
to perform with your
little estrogen Rockettes.

22:30.166 --> 22:32.385
You're right.
I'm afraid of your heat.

22:32.543 --> 22:33.669
(ALBERT) Here I am.

22:33.836 --> 22:36.510
The bag lady.
Good morning, Agador.

22:38.007 --> 22:41.056
Wash those, will you? They're
delivering the rest around noon.

22:41.218 --> 22:42.595
Good morning.

22:43.429 --> 22:44.851
My God, that beard!

22:45.931 --> 22:48.229
- Here you go.
- Thank you, dear.

22:52.062 --> 22:54.281
Turkish coffee.
Delicious.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.487
See?

22:55.900 --> 22:57.652
- Is Val still asleep?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:57.818 --> 23:02.244
He must be exhausted, poor baby.
You should have told me he was coming.

23:02.406 --> 23:06.036
I'm so ashamed of how I acted.
But how could I know?

23:07.036 --> 23:11.667
The truth is, you hate sharing your son
with me. You're always pushing me away.

23:11.832 --> 23:17.430
Oh, will you look at this shin?
It's a rag!

23:17.588 --> 23:21.638
No matter how many shirts I send him,
he only wears this one.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.179
You look awful.
What's wrong?

23:24.345 --> 23:25.688
Val's getting married.

23:25.846 --> 23:28.770
Don't be silly.
I got pork roast for dinner.

23:28.933 --> 23:32.858
I wanted to get fillet mignons,
but they're so expensive.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.648
What do you mean, married?

23:35.815 --> 23:37.317
You know what I mean.

23:38.526 --> 23:41.120
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

23:43.489 --> 23:45.332
To some girl he met at school.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.745
Oh, no! Oh, but...

23:49.745 --> 23:53.215
He's just a baby.
He'll ruin his life!

23:53.374 --> 23:55.968
We've been all
through that, okay?

23:56.126 --> 24:00.848
He's getting married, no matter what
we say. The less said, the better.

24:01.006 --> 24:02.474
Oh, my God.

24:05.386 --> 24:07.263
I woke up feeling so good.

24:08.973 --> 24:11.101
Now, all of a sudden, I feel...

24:11.267 --> 24:13.065
...(WHEEZING) so funny.

24:13.227 --> 24:16.697
Just breathe.
Let it go.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.233
Oh, you've heard.

24:18.399 --> 24:23.451
Oh, Value! Oh, my God,
this ¡s such a shock.

24:23.612 --> 24:26.081
I'm not saying anything.
I promised your father.

24:27.658 --> 24:30.832
But at 20, if you throw yourself
away on some dormitory slut,

24:30.995 --> 24:35.375
you'll be sorry the rest of your life.
There! Enough said. Subject closed.

24:35.541 --> 24:36.588
Hey, hey!

24:37.293 --> 24:40.422
Well, don't just stand there.
Give me a kiss!

24:40.588 --> 24:43.262
Or are you too grown-up
for that now?

24:44.425 --> 24:45.472
Hello, Albie.

24:47.553 --> 24:52.309
Oh, Armand, our baby is going to leave
us. And we won't have any others.

24:52.474 --> 24:54.351
Not without a miracle.

24:55.185 --> 24:59.736
<i>When Senator Keeley and I founded
the Coalition for Moral Order,</i>

24:59.899 --> 25:03.995
<i>it was to express moral,
rather than political, views.</i>

25:04.153 --> 25:06.952
<i>What Senator Jackson
is trying to say is that</i>

25:07.114 --> 25:09.037
<i>morality is political.</i>

25:09.199 --> 25:12.248
<i>Abortion, same-sex marriage...</i>

25:12.411 --> 25:14.084
It's a wonderful show.

25:14.538 --> 25:16.757
The most intelligent one
on television.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.213
<i>Pornography would not exist</i>

25:18.375 --> 25:21.504
<i>if politicians didn't
make laws to protect them.</i>

25:21.670 --> 25:24.890
<i>That's why both houses
are now Republican.</i>

25:27.384 --> 25:28.681
It's the perfect platform.

25:28.844 --> 25:34.146
I'm glad I got on Jackson's bandwagon
instead of Dole. Dole is just too...

25:34.308 --> 25:35.434
Dark.

25:35.601 --> 25:38.150
I was going to say liberal,
but he's dark, too.

25:38.312 --> 25:40.030
I gotta fire this woman.

25:40.189 --> 25:42.908
This young man Barbie
wants to marry...

25:43.067 --> 25:44.990
Miss Porter, page two,

25:45.152 --> 25:48.031
paragraph two,
it's "porno," not "pronto."

25:48.197 --> 25:53.203
I wonder if he's old money.
I mean, a cultural attaché.

25:53.369 --> 25:57.374
Your campaign manager is calling.
He says he's got to talk to you.

25:57.539 --> 25:59.212
Thank you, Bridget.

26:09.635 --> 26:10.852
Hello, Ben.

26:12.471 --> 26:13.939
Ready for what?

26:15.599 --> 26:16.646
What?

26:16.809 --> 26:18.231
What's wrong, Kevin?

26:18.519 --> 26:19.771
Jackson's dead.

26:19.937 --> 26:21.154
Oh, my God.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.611
He died in bed?
Whose bed?

26:24.525 --> 26:26.072
A prostitute?

26:27.111 --> 26:29.455
A minor?
And black?

26:30.531 --> 26:35.002
I don't believe this. I don't
fucking believe this! I'm ruined!

26:35.160 --> 26:40.667
You cannot be held responsible
for Senator Jackson's private life.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.803
I'm the Vice President of the
Coalition for Moral Order.

26:43.961 --> 26:47.841
My co-founder just died in the bed
of an underage black whore!

26:48.007 --> 26:50.430
Wait until the media finds out!

26:50.592 --> 26:51.639
Bridget!

26:52.678 --> 26:54.646
I could really use some candy!

27:54.323 --> 27:57.543
We may not make the live shot.
If we must, I'll do a stand-up.

27:57.701 --> 27:58.998
"He looked kind of funny..."

Where's Dad?

28:21.016 --> 28:25.066
He snuck out to meet with his advisers.
They wouldn't come here.

28:25.229 --> 28:27.948

They can't blame us for this.

28:41.078 --> 28:44.457
Eli Jackson was a common redneck.
We never saw him socially.

28:44.623 --> 28:48.719

Thank goodness they're not snobs.

28:48.877 --> 28:50.800

29:01.849 --> 29:04.978
I came through the orchard,

29:05.477 --> 29:07.229
You could have fallen.

29:07.396 --> 29:11.651

is all anyone can talk about.

29:12.776 --> 29:15.825
Kevin?
There may be a solution.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.992
What, death?
It didn't work for Jackson.

29:20.075 --> 29:24.000
What about a wedding?
A big, white wedding.

29:24.163 --> 29:27.212
What wedding?
Who's getting married?

29:27.374 --> 29:28.717
No, no!

29:28.876 --> 29:32.221
Why not?
It would restore your image.

29:32.379 --> 29:38.182
A wedding is hope. And a white wedding
is family and morality and tradition.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.471
And it would be such
a special marriage.

29:41.513 --> 29:46.235

a sort of a diplomat, really,

29:46.393 --> 29:49.613
who doesn't look down on us
because of Senator Jackson,

29:49.771 --> 29:54.572
willingly joining our family. It'd mean
the cover of <i>People, Time and Newsweek.</i>

29:54.735 --> 29:58.160
Love and optimism
versus cynicism and sex!

29:58.322 --> 30:03.123
It would be an affirmation! We could get
the Pope's blessing. It's not hard.

30:03.285 --> 30:08.462
No, he's too controversial.
What about Billy Graham?

30:08.624 --> 30:09.716
No, he's too liberal.

Armand... Coleman.

30:18.634 --> 30:22.389
(MRS. KEELEY) I wonder if they're
related to Tish and Bobo Coleman.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.602
- Are they from Boston?
- I don't think so.

30:24.765 --> 30:28.395
I think we should go to South Beach.
We should have dinner...

30:31.104 --> 30:33.698
We'll have dinner with them
and stay with the Bushes.

30:33.857 --> 30:39.409

Dad, Barbara's father is a senator,
a conservative senator.

34:31.344 --> 34:35.099
He's running for re-election.
And she told him...

34:38.059 --> 34:41.313
...you're the cultural attache to
Greece and Albert is a housewife.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.027
What?

34:44.690 --> 34:47.695
She had to. He founded
the Coalition for Moral Order.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.909
I don't care who he is.
I don't want to be someone else.

34:51.072 --> 34:52.619
Do you want me to be?

34:52.782 --> 34:56.536
No, no. Of course not.
And neither does she. But...

34:58.205 --> 34:59.752

Who's Kevin Keeley?

35:02.667 --> 35:03.964

- Not for this.

You said if Miss Donovan asked,
I should say you were a businessman.

35:34.324 --> 35:36.918
You were a baby, and she was
a small-minded idiot.

35:37.077 --> 35:38.704
I didn't want you to get hurt.

35:39.621 --> 35:41.999
It's different now.
You're a man.

35:42.165 --> 35:43.667
I can still get hurt.

me if you would help us.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.342

35:52.384 --> 35:56.434
This is insane.
What do I do, close the club

35:56.596 --> 36:00.066
so I can pretend to be a cultural
attache, whatever that is?

36:00.225 --> 36:04.401
And what about Albert? How do you make
Albert into a housewife?

36:04.563 --> 36:06.361
Well, you'd have to
send him away.

36:06.523 --> 36:08.651
Are you nuts?
You try sending Albert away.

36:08.817 --> 36:13.573
We'd never get him past the Keeleys.
Dad, we have to rid of a few things.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.615

36:15.782 --> 36:18.752
Well, that, for example.

That's a classic.

36:22.497 --> 36:23.999

one or two things, okay?

36:50.317 --> 36:52.570
It's everything.

36:53.486 --> 36:56.330
We're gonna have to tone
this down a little.

36:59.284 --> 37:04.711

so we can be more like other people.

have to try to,

37:08.501 --> 37:12.096
you know, change your
mannerisms a little.

37:12.255 --> 37:15.850
- What are you saying?
- Just be a little less obvious.

I'll buy you some.
- I need peds.

45:10.191 --> 45:13.161
- I'll buy you sandals.
- Armand! What's going on?

45:13.319 --> 45:18.325
- Why can't we go home?
- Nothing. Nothing.

45:18.491 --> 45:19.788
Then I'll see you upstairs.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.123
(SCREAMS)

45:21.786 --> 45:22.833
What?!

45:23.371 --> 45:25.544
- I hurt my thing.
- Your what?

45:25.706 --> 45:29.552
My ankle. I don't think
I can make it upstairs.

45:29.710 --> 45:32.008
- I'll bring down some ice.
- No, no!

45:32.171 --> 45:35.391
Why not?!
Ow, my arm!

45:35.550 --> 45:38.474
My arm. I hate it
when you get hysterical.

45:38.636 --> 45:39.853
Don't leave me!

45:42.890 --> 45:44.563
What is that?

45:45.518 --> 45:48.488
I got it from the antique store
next door. Too butch?

45:48.646 --> 45:50.865
Don't add.

45:51.023 --> 45:53.196
(ARMAND) Albert,
you're blocking my way.

45:53.359 --> 45:55.327
Put the moose on the patio.

45:57.155 --> 46:00.204
(ALBERT) Don't be such a baby.
Be careful!

46:00.366 --> 46:02.994
- (ARMAND) I can't move any faster.
- Lean on me.

46:03.161 --> 46:04.287
I need a doctor.

46:04.787 --> 46:07.131
Don't be silly.
It isn't even swollen.

46:07.290 --> 46:09.634
We should go to the emergency room.

46:09.792 --> 46:14.423
You're overreacting. Don't be
such a baby. Just sit down on...

46:15.464 --> 46:17.933
(ALBERT SCREAMS)

46:18.092 --> 46:19.969
We've been robbed.

46:20.136 --> 46:24.687
Albie, no. I've just taken
a few things out.

46:24.849 --> 46:27.022
They'll be returned
by the time you're back.

46:27.185 --> 46:29.608
Back?

46:31.355 --> 46:32.698
Where am I going?

46:34.817 --> 46:39.288
- You didn't tell him.
- What? Tell me what?

46:41.574 --> 46:45.579
Val's fiancée is coming tonight
with her parents.

46:45.745 --> 46:46.792
We thought...

46:49.081 --> 46:51.550
We thought it would be
better if you weren't here.

47:00.426 --> 47:01.848
I see.

47:04.722 --> 47:07.942
- I see.
- It's just for tonight.

47:08.100 --> 47:10.353
I understand.
Just while people are here.

47:11.103 --> 47:12.901
(ALBERT)
It's all right, my darling.

47:13.064 --> 47:16.659
It's nothing.
It's painful...

47:17.777 --> 47:19.745
...but it's not important.

47:21.656 --> 47:24.785
- I'm leaving.
- It's just one night, Albert.

47:24.951 --> 47:26.203
The monster...

47:27.870 --> 47:30.623
...the freak is leaving.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.218
You're safe.

47:44.053 --> 47:46.181
That went well.

47:49.809 --> 47:51.026
Albert!

47:53.396 --> 47:55.990
Albert!
Will you listen?

47:56.148 --> 47:59.698
Go away. I hate you!
I never want to see you again.

48:01.404 --> 48:04.248
My heart is breaking.

48:04.407 --> 48:06.876
Please don't cry. It's okay.
You can stay.

48:07.034 --> 48:09.332
I won't stay where
I'm not wanted.

48:09.495 --> 48:12.840
Where I can be thrown out on a whim
without legal rights.

48:12.999 --> 48:14.467
I have the palimony papers.

48:14.625 --> 48:17.344
You're lying again.
This is too much for me.

48:17.503 --> 48:20.006
Too much ugliness, too much pain.

48:21.465 --> 48:23.593
Feel my pulse.
Am I all right?

48:24.093 --> 48:27.393
My goodness, it's very fast.
Let's get you out of the sun.

48:38.774 --> 48:40.617
- Waiter! Water.
- Right away.

48:40.776 --> 48:42.904
(ALBERT) It's the end.
I know it is.

48:43.070 --> 48:45.118
No, it isn't. Just breathe.

48:45.990 --> 48:47.867
Thank you, Rodrigo.
And the usual.

48:48.034 --> 48:50.082
Right away, Señor Goldman.

48:50.453 --> 48:52.171
There you go.

48:52.330 --> 48:54.628
Thank you. That's better.

48:57.168 --> 49:01.014
This is not about you.
The girl's parents are assholes.

49:01.172 --> 49:02.515
Val is crazy about you.

49:02.673 --> 49:04.801
Is he? Oh, that helps.

49:05.509 --> 49:07.603
Oh, you're so sweet.

49:08.971 --> 49:10.564
That water is so cool.

49:12.683 --> 49:17.189
Maybe it is a bit much to introduce
me as his mother on the first visit.

49:17.355 --> 49:20.279
Could you say I was a
visiting relative?

49:20.441 --> 49:21.784
Val's uncle? Uncle Al?

49:21.942 --> 49:24.320
What's the point?
To be Val's gay uncle?

49:24.487 --> 49:26.455
I could play it straight.

49:26.614 --> 49:29.333
Oh, please. Look at you,
at how you hold your glass.

49:29.492 --> 49:31.870
Look at your pinky,
your posture.

49:32.036 --> 49:37.133
What about you? You're obviously
not a cultural... whatever it is.

49:37.291 --> 49:39.635
You've never been to a museum
and you eat like a pig.

49:39.794 --> 49:44.721
These conservatives don't care
if you're a pig, just if you're a fag.

49:51.847 --> 49:55.977
Oh, fuck 'em. Of course
you can pass as an uncle.

49:56.143 --> 49:58.817
You're a great performer,
I'm a great director.

49:58.979 --> 50:01.073
Together we can do anything.

50:01.232 --> 50:02.575
Oh, Armand. Really?

50:02.733 --> 50:05.657
Absolutely.
We've got five hours.

50:05.820 --> 50:08.949
First, get your pinky down.
It's up again.

50:09.990 --> 50:11.708
And your posture.

50:11.867 --> 50:15.246
My God! Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

50:15.413 --> 50:18.883
Stop screaming!
I'm teaching you to act like a man.

50:19.458 --> 50:21.552
(ARMAND) All right, all right.

50:21.710 --> 50:25.055
It's a dinner party,
let's work with food.

50:26.048 --> 50:28.551
Spread some mustard
on the toast.

50:30.553 --> 50:34.228
Don't use the spoon. And
don't dribble dots of mustard.

50:34.390 --> 50:36.063
You take your knife...

50:36.767 --> 50:40.146
...and you smear.
Men smear.

50:40.312 --> 50:42.531
Smear. Yeah.

50:45.818 --> 50:51.416
Get the goddamn pinky down! Make
your fingers like iron. Stop trembling!

50:51.574 --> 50:54.123
Hold the knife boldly, with strength.

50:54.285 --> 50:56.504
Oh, God!
I pierced the toast!

50:56.662 --> 51:01.509
So what? Just remember not to go
to pieces when that happens.

51:01.667 --> 51:03.920
React like a man, calmly.

51:04.086 --> 51:09.058
You say to yourself, "Albert, you
pierced the toast. So what?"

51:09.216 --> 51:11.810
It's not the end of your life.

51:11.969 --> 51:15.599
"Albert, you pierced the toast.
So what?"

51:16.807 --> 51:19.276
Of course. There's no
need to get hysterical.

51:19.435 --> 51:22.484
All I have to remember is,
I can always get more toast.

51:22.646 --> 51:25.115
That's the spirit.
Let's try walking.

51:25.274 --> 51:29.029
- Holding the sandwich?
- It doesn't matter. Just walk.

51:31.071 --> 51:32.118
Down!

51:55.763 --> 51:56.935
Too swishy?

51:59.141 --> 52:00.893
Let me give you an image.

52:01.060 --> 52:04.564
It's a cliché, but it's an image.
John Wayne.

52:04.730 --> 52:07.529
Oh, God! Couldn't we start
with someone easier?

52:07.691 --> 52:09.443
Come on. You're a big fan.

52:09.610 --> 52:11.533
He has a very distinctive walk.

52:11.737 --> 52:16.083
Very easy to imitate. And if anyone
was a man... Now try it.

52:16.242 --> 52:19.997
Now just get off your horse
and head into the saloon.

52:24.083 --> 52:25.130
Nice touch.

52:40.933 --> 52:42.685
Howdy, ma'am.

52:50.150 --> 52:51.242
No good?

52:52.570 --> 52:56.575
Actually, it's perfect. I never
realized John Wayne walked like that.

53:13.757 --> 53:14.804
Hang on.

53:19.138 --> 53:21.266
This guy's a fucking maniac.

53:23.434 --> 53:24.731
What's in South Beach?

53:25.603 --> 53:29.699
Armand Goldman,
you old so-and-so.

53:29.857 --> 53:31.325
How about those Dolphins?

53:33.444 --> 53:34.866
Screaming queen?

53:36.363 --> 53:40.539
The hand goes sideways, not palm down.
I'm shaking it, not kissing it.

53:40.701 --> 53:41.873
Tighten your wrist.

53:42.036 --> 53:44.835
No, straighten it, then tighten it.

53:46.123 --> 53:48.171
Al, you old so-and-so.

53:48.334 --> 53:50.211
- I just said that.
- Now I'm saying it.

53:50.377 --> 53:52.505
Okay. Straighten, tighten.

53:59.303 --> 54:04.059
Al, you old son of a bitch!
How do you feel about that call today?

54:04.224 --> 54:09.355
The Dolphins, in the fourth on their
30-yard line with only 34 seconds to go.

54:09.521 --> 54:12.741
How do you think I feel?
Betrayed. Bewildered.

54:14.109 --> 54:15.281
Wrong response?

54:16.403 --> 54:18.952
I'm not sure.
Take it from the top.

54:19.114 --> 54:20.411
This is very exciting.

54:20.574 --> 54:23.327
- It is, fella.
- Right on, amigo!

54:23.494 --> 54:24.871
- Damn straight.
- Damn straight!

54:25.037 --> 54:26.630
(SPITS)

54:26.789 --> 54:28.757
- Fuckin' A!
- Fuckin' A, right!

54:28.916 --> 54:30.384
(YELPS)

54:30.542 --> 54:33.091
Swing that by me again,
little buddy.

54:33.253 --> 54:36.382
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Take it easy.

54:36.548 --> 54:38.346
You take it easy, pilgrim.

54:38.509 --> 54:41.604
- He bumped into me.
- Tough gazongas.

54:41.762 --> 54:43.264
Why are you being a prick?

54:43.430 --> 54:45.558
Why are you being an asshole?

54:50.396 --> 54:52.649
Are you calling me an asshole?

54:53.524 --> 54:56.243
Actually, I'm talking to
the asshole behind you.

54:59.321 --> 55:03.076
See, the swelling's already
gone down. It's nothing.

55:03.242 --> 55:07.372
You were magnificent,
marvelous, very masculine.

55:07.538 --> 55:08.881
I'm so proud of you.

55:09.039 --> 55:11.667
That big gorilla looked ridiculous
when he sat on you

55:11.834 --> 55:15.134
and banged your head on the ground.
He didn't even know how to box!

55:15.671 --> 55:18.174
Thank you, Value.
You're a dear.

55:19.591 --> 55:22.435
I'll get you some more ice.
Be right back, love.

55:29.727 --> 55:34.153
Dad, could we hire a straight maid
for tonight?

55:34.314 --> 55:36.863
There are no straight
maids in South Beach.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.362
And I have more bad news for you.

55:40.529 --> 55:42.406
I told Albert he could stay.

55:44.324 --> 55:46.167
You did what? Why?

55:46.326 --> 55:49.580
Why? Because he told me
his heart was breaking

55:49.747 --> 55:52.421
and he's my friend
and companion.

55:52.958 --> 55:54.460
Who will we say he is?

55:54.626 --> 55:55.878
Your uncle.

55:56.044 --> 55:57.967
My uncle?

55:58.130 --> 56:00.428
Let's just forget
the whole thing.

56:00.591 --> 56:04.721
Don't be so negative!
Have a little hope!

56:04.887 --> 56:08.812
About what? Once they see you
and Albert together...

56:09.516 --> 56:13.521
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I was feeling so good, and now...

56:14.354 --> 56:16.152
God, what a mess.

56:16.315 --> 56:18.534
We need a woman.

56:18.692 --> 56:21.616
We can pass Albert off as an uncle
if we have a woman as a mother.

56:21.779 --> 56:24.908
Ironic, isn't it?
When you need a woman...

56:26.200 --> 56:28.248
Why don't I ask your mother?

56:28.660 --> 56:31.630
My mother wouldn't do it.
Would she?

56:31.789 --> 56:35.134
- How do we know?
- 'Cause she hasn't seen me in 20 years.

56:35.292 --> 56:40.514
No. 20 years ago, she was
a young girl, scared, broke. Now...

56:40.672 --> 56:42.800
(ALBERT) You can't be serious!

56:43.967 --> 56:47.892
It's very unfair of you to try to talk
Val into this. He has every reason...

56:48.055 --> 56:49.477
You think she'd do it?

56:51.558 --> 56:53.060
My mother?

56:54.770 --> 56:57.694
Oh, my God. Armand?

56:57.856 --> 57:01.736
I don't believe it.
It's been 100 years. Where are you?

57:01.902 --> 57:03.950
I'll be there in five minutes.

57:04.112 --> 57:06.114
<i>I can hardly wait.</i>

57:06.281 --> 57:08.409
Me, too. Bye-bye.

57:10.327 --> 57:11.920
She's gonna see me.

57:13.163 --> 57:16.007
Why don't I drop you
off at a café?

57:16.166 --> 57:20.421
No, I'll come up with you.
I'm sure there's a waiting room.

57:33.725 --> 57:37.070
Hello. Katharine Archer, please.
It's Armand Goldman.

57:37.229 --> 57:38.776
Go right in.

57:38.939 --> 57:40.566
Thank you.

57:44.862 --> 57:46.785
Just sit!

57:48.156 --> 57:49.328
Excuse us.

57:53.912 --> 57:55.380
Army Goldman.

57:55.539 --> 57:59.043
Katie Archer.
Or is it Mrs. something?

57:59.209 --> 58:02.839
No. I'm between husbands.
Sit down.

58:04.548 --> 58:07.927
I've thought about
you so many times.

58:08.093 --> 58:12.314
Whenever I saw an ad for The Birdcage.
Are you still with Albert?

58:12.472 --> 58:14.315
Yes, we're still together.

58:14.474 --> 58:16.147
And you...

58:16.894 --> 58:18.612
...you've done well.

58:18.770 --> 58:22.240
The money you gave me
started this place.

58:22.566 --> 58:23.738
You should have
gotten stock for it.

58:23.901 --> 58:26.654
I got Val for it.
It was a fair trade.

58:27.654 --> 58:29.372
Is he...?

58:30.657 --> 58:31.749
How is he?

58:31.909 --> 58:35.038
He's fine.
He wants to get married.

58:35.203 --> 58:36.796
Married? How old is he?

58:36.955 --> 58:39.458
- 20.
- 20?

58:41.168 --> 58:43.045
My God, 20 years.

58:43.211 --> 58:46.590
And today, for the first time,
he really needs you.

59:03.440 --> 59:04.532
Shiny.

59:08.403 --> 59:11.657
<i>(KATHARINE ON INTERCOM) Imelda, cancel
my appointments for tonight.</i>

59:17.496 --> 59:22.297
I normally drink vegetable juice
during business hours, but for this...

59:22.459 --> 59:26.930
...let's drink to Senator Keeley's
daughter and our Val.

59:27.089 --> 59:30.184
I haven't done much for him
in the last 20 years.

59:30.342 --> 59:32.515
Don't worry about that.

59:32.678 --> 59:34.146
I'm not exactly maternal.

59:34.304 --> 59:36.477
- (POP)
- I am.

59:37.474 --> 59:39.192
I'm very maternal.

59:39.351 --> 59:41.570
And Albert's practically a breast.

59:49.903 --> 59:52.656
Do you remember the show
where we met?

59:52.823 --> 59:54.325
Very well.

01:07:23.982 --> 01:07:26.906

01:14:30.408 --> 01:14:33.878
Did you just say,
"See you in half an hour, Mom"?

- Was that...?
- Yes.

Dad uses this place more for work and...
reflection than anything else.

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:51.033
So it's not so much
a vacation house as a...

That's the way nature made them.

01:27:01.908 --> 01:27:03.910
Maybe I'm just an old-fashioned girl,

01:27:04.077 --> 01:27:08.708
but I pity the woman who's too busy
to take care of her man.

01:27:08.874 --> 01:27:12.469
Hear, hear! It's so nice
to meet people like you.

01:27:12.628 --> 01:27:16.258
(SENATOR KEELEY)
Our kind of people.

01:27:16.423 --> 01:27:21.350
C-O-L-E-M-A-N.
There's no first name on the bell.

01:27:21.511 --> 01:27:23.354
Sure? They can't find them.

01:27:23.513 --> 01:27:27.768
What about the name in front
of the club... Goldman? That's close.

01:27:27.934 --> 01:27:30.653
You're right.
Wouldn't that be something?

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:32.564
Try Goldman. What was it?

01:27:32.731 --> 01:27:34.404
Armand Goldman.

01:27:35.025 --> 01:27:38.871
It's so odd to me,
this fuss over school prayer.

01:27:39.029 --> 01:27:42.203
As if anyone,
Jews, Muslims, whatever,

01:27:42.366 --> 01:27:44.744
would mind if their children
prayed in the classroom.

01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:47.914
- It's insane.
- (AGADOR LAUGHS)

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.084
Thank you, Agador Spartacus!
You may go.

01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:57.256
He's very nice,
but such a problem.

01:27:57.422 --> 01:28:00.346
We never know
what makes him laugh.

01:28:00.509 --> 01:28:02.432
At least he speaks English.

01:28:02.594 --> 01:28:07.316
We have been through more chauffeurs
in the last six months...

01:28:07.474 --> 01:28:11.524
And the maids we've run through
in the last six years!

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:14.691
- Rodney, Bruno, Chuck...
- Look! You all need more ice.

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:16.904
I have a good feeling
about you people.

01:28:17.067 --> 01:28:18.910
Not a lot of clever books
on the shelves,

01:28:19.069 --> 01:28:21.197
no fancy art on the walls.

01:28:21.363 --> 01:28:22.706
Just the crucifix,

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:25.663
and a lot of good,
warm, family feeling.

01:28:25.826 --> 01:28:28.545
This is what Clinton missed
when he started in on school prayer

01:28:28.704 --> 01:28:30.126
and gays in the military.

01:28:30.288 --> 01:28:31.790
More ice for you.

01:28:31.957 --> 01:28:35.177
There's an idiotic issue,
gays in the military!

01:28:35.335 --> 01:28:38.680
I mean, those haircuts,
those uniforms, who cares?!

01:28:38.839 --> 01:28:41.934
Mom, don't talk about things
you don't know about.

01:28:42.092 --> 01:28:45.096
Don't patronize your mother.
She's amazingly intelligent.

01:28:45.262 --> 01:28:47.640
- I think homosexuality...
- A lot more ice for you!

01:28:47.806 --> 01:28:49.023
More for me, Dad.

01:28:49.182 --> 01:28:51.184
...Is one of the things
weakening this country.

01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:53.103
Really?

01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:56.444
That's what I thought until I found
out Alexander the Great was a fag.

01:28:56.606 --> 01:28:58.324
Talk about gays in the military!

01:28:58.483 --> 01:29:00.827
How about those Dolphins?

01:29:04.865 --> 01:29:06.333
I'll get it.

01:29:11.288 --> 01:29:16.920
I think we're skirting an issue here
that has Mr. Coleman very nervous.

01:29:19.671 --> 01:29:22.595
You must have heard about
how Senator Jackson died.

01:29:24.384 --> 01:29:26.728
Oh, that.

01:29:26.887 --> 01:29:29.515
Yes, what an ugly story.

01:29:30.557 --> 01:29:32.776
Of course, we don't
believe a word of it.

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:36.063
- What do you mean?
- He was obviously framed.

01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:40.154
- I, for one, would like an autopsy.
- Mom...

01:29:41.359 --> 01:29:43.578
That's just what
Rush Limbaugh said.

01:29:46.323 --> 01:29:47.324
Excuse me.

01:29:52.037 --> 01:29:56.292
The tension... it's like riding a
psychotic horse toward a burning stable.

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:59.302
Dinner is going to be late, okay?

01:29:59.461 --> 01:30:02.465
'Cause you give me
so little time to shop.

01:30:02.964 --> 01:30:05.968
Barbara's nice.
I owe it to Val,

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:07.807
growing up the way he did.
It can't have been easy.

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:11.769
I'm sorry to laugh at Miss Albert,
but what is that hairdo?

01:30:11.932 --> 01:30:15.311
Fuck it! It's one night.
I can live through it.

01:30:17.103 --> 01:30:20.733
Of course, it's wrong
to kill an abortion doctor.

01:30:20.899 --> 01:30:25.370
Many pro-lifers, I don't agree with
them, but they feel that if you...

01:30:25.529 --> 01:30:26.701
I'm here, son.

01:30:26.863 --> 01:30:29.207
...stop the doctors,
you stop the abortions.

01:30:29.366 --> 01:30:33.337
That's ridiculous.
The doctors are only doing their jobs.

01:30:33.495 --> 01:30:36.339
Better to kill the mothers.
That will stop them.

01:30:36.957 --> 01:30:38.925
May I see you a moment, dear?

01:30:39.084 --> 01:30:43.214
I know, I know, if you kill the
mother, the fetus dies, too.

01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:47.476
But the fetus is going to be aborted,
so let it go down with the ship.

01:30:47.634 --> 01:30:49.511
I really must see you now.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:52.226
Excuse me.

01:30:59.896 --> 01:31:01.614
I assure you,

01:31:01.773 --> 01:31:05.368
Mother is just following a train
of thought to its logical

01:31:05.569 --> 01:31:07.492
yet absurd conclusion.

01:31:07.654 --> 01:31:10.077
As Jonathan Swift did
when he suggested

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.618
Irish peasants feed
their babies to the rich.

01:31:13.535 --> 01:31:16.914
I don't know about Jonathan Swift,
but I know one thing about your mother.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:21.711
She's a passionate woman
who follows her heart. And I love her.

01:31:23.336 --> 01:31:25.634
So Goldman owns the club,

01:31:25.797 --> 01:31:29.427
lives above it, owns the
building and he's gay.

01:31:30.802 --> 01:31:32.770

Barbara, Albert isn't my mother.
He's a drag queen.

01:32:06.755 --> 01:32:10.885
That's right, I keep forgetting.

Agador Spartacus.

01:32:43.625 --> 01:32:48.677
Thank you. Thank you, all.
Dinner is served.

01:32:48.838 --> 01:32:54.220
Wonderful. This way, Senator.
You know, I played Eliza in high school.

01:32:54.386 --> 01:32:56.263
I'll bet you were lovely.

01:32:59.265 --> 01:33:02.109
Go inside. I'll tape a note
to Katharine to the door.

01:33:03.103 --> 01:33:06.983
Mrs. Keeley over there,
and the Senator on my right.

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:10.652
Val, over here.
And Barbara, dear, please sit.

01:33:10.819 --> 01:33:12.696
You are the most gracious hostess.

01:33:12.862 --> 01:33:14.455
Oh, thank you so much.

01:33:14.614 --> 01:33:17.117
I'm having such a wonderful time.

01:33:17.993 --> 01:33:20.371
This is what I've always dreamed of:

01:33:20.537 --> 01:33:24.508
a big, loving family
gathered around the table,

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:26.509
the way it was when I was a girl.

01:33:26.668 --> 01:33:28.548
(SENATOR KEELEY)
That's the way we grew up, too.

01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:33.642
(ALBERT) It was a wonderful world then,
wasn't it? Happy families and

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:37.521
everyone speaking English
and no drugs and no AIDS.

01:33:37.679 --> 01:33:38.896
Easy on the wine, Mom.

01:33:39.055 --> 01:33:40.682
What interesting china!

01:33:40.849 --> 01:33:44.479
It looks like young men
playing leapfrog.

01:33:44.644 --> 01:33:45.736
Is it Greek?

01:33:47.605 --> 01:33:51.326
(SQUEALS) I... I...

01:33:51.484 --> 01:33:53.157
...I have no idea.

01:33:53.319 --> 01:33:55.617
I've never seen these bowls before.

01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:59.205
Really? Barbara,
get me my glasses, dear.

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:01.290
They're in my purse by the chair.

01:34:01.453 --> 01:34:04.673
(SENATOR KEELEY)
Where are my glasses? It is Greek.

01:34:04.831 --> 01:34:09.132
Greek boys, actually.
Uh, naked Greek boys.

01:34:09.335 --> 01:34:12.088
And girls!
Doesn't your bowl have girls?

01:34:12.255 --> 01:34:15.850
- (VAL) I have one!
- (ALBERT) Mine, too! Oh, look.

01:34:16.009 --> 01:34:18.558
There. I think that's a girl.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.099
Then you haven't seen one in a long
time. That's a boy.

01:34:22.265 --> 01:34:25.439
I may need glasses,
but I can see that.

01:34:26.102 --> 01:34:29.652
I couldn't find your glasses.
Maybe they're in the car.

01:34:29.814 --> 01:34:31.908
I have mine. Here.

01:34:33.818 --> 01:34:36.287
Hurry, you idiot!
They're looking at the bowls.

01:34:36.446 --> 01:34:38.790
How could you put out bowls
without looking at them?!

01:34:38.948 --> 01:34:41.747
Stop ladling!
Give me the pot!

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:43.662
- You can't serve out of that!
- Move!

01:34:43.828 --> 01:34:45.922
Wait! There's shrimps.

01:34:46.081 --> 01:34:47.628
(SENATOR KEELEY) Let's see what
these Greeks are doing.

01:34:47.791 --> 01:34:49.919
(ARMAND) Here we go.

01:34:51.586 --> 01:34:56.763
Agador's superb soup. We're in luck,
he doesn't make this for everyone.

01:34:56.925 --> 01:35:00.054
This is his specialty,
seafood chowder.

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:01.805
- Isn't that an egg?
- What?

01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:05.475
- An egg.
- Why, yes, it is. It is a huevo.

01:35:06.476 --> 01:35:08.820
This is so Guatemala.

01:35:08.978 --> 01:35:11.857
They put eggs in
everything down there

01:35:12.023 --> 01:35:15.493
because chicken is
so important to them.

01:35:15.652 --> 01:35:18.576
It's their only real currency.

01:35:18.738 --> 01:35:21.617
A woman is said to be
worth her weight in hens.

01:35:21.783 --> 01:35:25.378
A man's wealth is measured
by the size of his cock.

01:35:25.537 --> 01:35:27.289
Will you excuse me?

01:35:30.792 --> 01:35:32.260
What the hell is this?

01:35:32.418 --> 01:35:36.264
Sweet and sour peasant soup.
Why'd you say it was seafood chowder?

01:35:36.422 --> 01:35:40.017
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know. I made it up!

01:35:40.176 --> 01:35:41.302
God, this is a nightmare.

01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:47.646
(SLURPING NOISES)

01:35:54.357 --> 01:35:56.485
Where are you
staying in Florida?

01:35:57.652 --> 01:36:00.496
With the Jeb Bushes,
on Fisher Island.

01:36:00.655 --> 01:36:04.410
Fisher Island.
Such a lovely spot.

01:36:04.576 --> 01:36:08.331
My parents lived on Fisher
Island until they died.

01:36:09.914 --> 01:36:13.384
I thought you were visiting
your parents in Palm Beach.

01:36:13.543 --> 01:36:15.341
(DEEP VOICE) What?

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:18.973
Oh, yes, uh... now...

01:36:19.966 --> 01:36:21.513
...that they're dead.

01:36:21.968 --> 01:36:23.015
They moved...

01:36:24.304 --> 01:36:26.523
...were moved... because...

01:36:29.434 --> 01:36:30.936
Well...

01:36:31.102 --> 01:36:34.902
My mother always said,
"Live on Fisher Island,

01:36:35.064 --> 01:36:37.032
get buried in Palm Beach,

01:36:37.192 --> 01:36:40.571
that way you'll have
the best of Florida."

01:36:42.322 --> 01:36:45.292
Dad, get in there.
Everything is going to hell.

01:36:45.450 --> 01:36:47.703
He didn't make an entrée.

01:36:47.869 --> 01:36:51.123
What? You... you mean
we just have soup?

01:36:51.289 --> 01:36:54.168
Peasant soup is an entrée.
It's like stew!

01:36:54.334 --> 01:36:56.007
Why do you think I
put so much in it?!

01:36:56.169 --> 01:36:57.842
Shut up!

01:36:58.004 --> 01:37:00.848
Put Katharine's note
on the downstairs door.

01:37:01.007 --> 01:37:03.726
I have to go back before
they get to the bottom of the bowls.

01:37:03.885 --> 01:37:07.355
I had so much to do.
You give me no time to shop!

01:37:07.513 --> 01:37:08.685
Shut up!

01:37:08.848 --> 01:37:11.317
It's okay!
We're all right!

01:37:11.476 --> 01:37:14.605
Shut up, goddamn you!
Stop crying! Goddamn you!

01:37:14.771 --> 01:37:18.321
Don't just stand there!
She'll be here any minute! Go!

01:37:18.483 --> 01:37:20.406
Goddamn it!
Fuck the shrimp!

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:29.502
Oh, my God.
That's it. That's it.

01:37:29.661 --> 01:37:32.961
- That's the Lincoln.
- Park here. The street's jammed.

01:37:33.122 --> 01:37:36.467
- This is an intersection.
- So? We're the press.

01:37:48.096 --> 01:37:53.148
<i>"Katharine, do not go upstairs.
I'll call you tomorrow. Armand."</i>

01:37:53.309 --> 01:37:55.186
This is going to be great.

From that day on, they looked
for a cemetery they really loved

01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:02.364
instead of eating tofu.

01:38:02.568 --> 01:38:05.242
Daddy favored Key Biscayne, but...

01:38:05.405 --> 01:38:07.533
Time for dessert.
You get everything done?

01:38:07.699 --> 01:38:08.746
Yes.

01:38:08.908 --> 01:38:12.037
Shall we have our coffee
in the living room?

01:38:15.665 --> 01:38:18.589
No, it's his town car.
I am looking at it.

01:38:21.421 --> 01:38:25.142
We're in the middle of a bunch
of drag clubs. I don't know.

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.177
We got authorization.

01:38:27.343 --> 01:38:28.845
So, three?

01:38:31.389 --> 01:38:34.734
- So, where are they?
- They went around the corner there.

01:38:41.774 --> 01:38:46.154
So what do you think of these kids
getting married?

01:38:46.321 --> 01:38:50.292
Well, she's only 18
and he's only 20, so I...

01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:51.997
(MUSIC)

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.506
Good God. That sounds like
it's coming from downstairs.

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:59.264
(MRS. KEELEY) It must be coming
from that nightclub on the corner.

01:38:59.292 --> 01:39:01.294
This must be the same building.

01:39:01.461 --> 01:39:06.638
You're joking! I always thought
that was someone's television set.

01:39:06.799 --> 01:39:09.678
Now, Mother, you know
we live above a nightclub.

01:39:09.844 --> 01:39:12.973
She's travelled around
the world, but deep down

01:39:13.139 --> 01:39:16.439
she's still a girl from
Grover's Corners.

01:39:16.601 --> 01:39:18.695
I'm afraid I am a bit naive.

01:39:20.021 --> 01:39:22.023
Don't be ashamed of Grover's Corners.

01:39:22.190 --> 01:39:26.320
It's not a chateau, but it's a
darn good place to call home.

01:39:26.486 --> 01:39:30.707
Thank you.
I will remember that.

01:39:30.865 --> 01:39:35.496
Of course, Armand is much more
sophisticated than I am.

01:39:35.661 --> 01:39:39.757
But then, he comes
from such good stock.

01:39:40.792 --> 01:39:43.921
Just like those two
adorable youngsters.

01:39:44.253 --> 01:39:46.255
Don't you agree?

01:39:46.422 --> 01:39:48.800
- Where's the bathroom?
- (VAL) I'll show you.

01:39:48.966 --> 01:39:52.891
- No, I want Mother Coleman to show me.
- My dear child!

01:39:53.054 --> 01:39:54.601
One kiss, darling.

01:39:54.764 --> 01:39:56.937
- I'm only going to the bathroom.
- (VAL) We'll all go.

All of us together.

(ALBERT) This is so moving,
I think I'm going to cry!

01:40:08.194 --> 01:40:11.573
Something very
strange is going on.

01:40:11.948 --> 01:40:14.042
I know.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.702
I mean, that dinner.

01:40:17.078 --> 01:40:19.831
I know there was something
on those bowls.

01:40:19.997 --> 01:40:23.342
And the son disappearing
while we were eating.

01:40:23.501 --> 01:40:25.924
I know just what's going on.

01:40:26.087 --> 01:40:27.555
It's the oldest story in the world.

01:40:27.713 --> 01:40:29.090
What is it?

01:40:32.218 --> 01:40:34.186

01:40:35.847 --> 01:40:39.693
...and he's a pretentious European,
the worst kind.

Him and his Cole d'whatever.

01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:45.945
And his decadent china.
I've seen it all before.

01:40:46.107 --> 01:40:48.405
Aristotle Onassis was like this.

01:40:48.568 --> 01:40:51.947
And all of the French.
Especially Mitterrand.

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.874
And the English.
Not Margaret Thatcher, of course.

01:40:55.032 --> 01:40:58.957
But I bet John Major has something
on the side. And she can't handle it.

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.214
- Who?
- Mrs. Coleman.

01:41:01.372 --> 01:41:03.466
Why should she care
about John Major?

01:41:03.958 --> 01:41:06.928
No. Mrs. Coleman
can't handle him.

01:41:07.086 --> 01:41:10.932
Coleman and his nasty
little European traditions.

01:41:11.757 --> 01:41:15.227
And his snobbery. And that dig
about Grover's Corners.

01:41:15.386 --> 01:41:17.104
Kevin, you're rambling.

01:41:17.263 --> 01:41:21.564
Well, it makes me furious,
the contempt he has for her.

01:41:21.726 --> 01:41:25.401
Did you see him when she talked?
He looked almost frightened.

01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:30.110
He won't let her run the house.
He's in the kitchen. He serves.

01:41:30.276 --> 01:41:33.246
He tells that beige
savage what to do.

01:41:38.618 --> 01:41:39.619
What?

01:41:39.785 --> 01:41:44.416
I'm so sorry.
I've ruined everything!

01:41:44.582 --> 01:41:48.337
Don't be silly. No-one noticed the wig.
Where's the spirit gum?

01:41:48.503 --> 01:41:49.846
They took everything away.

01:41:50.004 --> 01:41:54.009
I have a barrette. If you don't move
your head, it might work.

01:41:54.175 --> 01:41:56.849
Thank you.
You're a very sweet girl.

01:41:57.512 --> 01:41:58.855
I'm so sorry, Val.

01:42:00.181 --> 01:42:04.607
You didn't have this kind of sympathy
for poor Bessie Jackson!

01:42:04.769 --> 01:42:06.897
Bessie Jackson is an
insensitive cow.

01:42:07.063 --> 01:42:11.159
This woman is a lady.
You know, she'll be your in-law, too.

01:42:11.317 --> 01:42:16.118
If he's so terrible, maybe your
daughter shouldn't marry his son!

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.456
He's not terrible in that way.
He won't get mixed up in some scandal.

01:42:20.618 --> 01:42:24.088
- I've never really seen you before.
- What do you mean?

01:42:24.247 --> 01:42:29.799
I don't even know who you are!
All you think about is your career.

01:42:30.545 --> 01:42:32.843
And poor, little Mrs. Coleman.

01:42:33.005 --> 01:42:36.054
Oh, please. You're just as worried
about my career as I am.

01:42:36.217 --> 01:42:39.687
You're the one who pushed for the
marriage. Barbara can handle that boy.

01:42:39.845 --> 01:42:41.847
She's a modern woman,
tough as nails.

01:42:42.014 --> 01:42:45.985
Mrs. Coleman is just
very vulnerable.

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:49.981

make woman like that anymore.

to meet you. I'm sorry I'm so late...

Sorry to take so long, but Barbara...
What is she doing here?

01:43:38.529 --> 01:43:39.655
Let me explain.

Explain to all of us.

I don't want to
embarrass this lovely lady,

01:43:43.909 --> 01:43:47.254
but how many
mothers does Val have?

01:43:47.413 --> 01:43:49.006
What?

01:43:49.165 --> 01:43:51.714
This woman introduced
herself as Val's mother.

How many mothers does he have?

01:43:59.091 --> 01:44:00.388
Just one.

01:44:05.097 --> 01:44:06.223
This is my mother.

01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:11.738
My father owns the club downstairs.
My mother is the star.

What?

01:44:14.732 --> 01:44:18.737
We lied to you, Barbara and I.
And everyone lied for us.

These are my parents.

01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:24.492
This is my wife.

This is the lady who had Val.

01:44:28.371 --> 01:44:29.793
Nice to meet you, Katharine.

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:32.128
Very nice, Val.

01:44:32.291 --> 01:44:34.544
You've done a good job.

01:44:35.127 --> 01:44:37.880
Thank you.
We're very proud of him.

01:44:38.047 --> 01:44:39.390
I don't understand.

01:44:39.548 --> 01:44:44.224
Barbara, the nightclub
downstairs, he owns it?

01:44:46.097 --> 01:44:48.145
He's not a cultural attaché?

01:44:50.059 --> 01:44:54.530
No. And he isn't married
to a housewife.

01:44:54.689 --> 01:44:57.613
And their name is Goldman,
not Coleman.

01:44:58.359 --> 01:44:59.360

No. You can't be Jewish.

...this may not help, but I want you
to know I meant every word I said

01:45:32.977 --> 01:45:37.824
about a return to family values
and a stricter moral code.

01:45:37.982 --> 01:45:39.404
I feel like I'm insane.

01:45:39.567 --> 01:45:41.740
It's really very simple.
Armand and I...

It's still me.

Well, not tiny.

Barbara, please don't
do this to me.

as Mrs. Coleman...

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:18.148
...but I still have feelings.

I've never danced with a man before.

<i>Perdóname.</i>

01:52:30.727 --> 01:52:33.776
No one will dance with me.
It's this dress.

01:52:33.939 --> 01:52:35.816
I knew white would
make me look fat.

01:52:35.983 --> 01:52:38.702
What about me? I'm as
pretty as these other guys.

- Not you. Barbara.

Don't go. I don't want to be
the only girl not dancing.

Just head for the door.
We'll be out of here soon.

01:52:50.372 --> 01:52:52.841
Care to dance... baby?
