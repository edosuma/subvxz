We're out of pepperoni!
I'm starving, and we're out of pepperoni!

01:18.133 --> 01:19.400
I'm sorry, Sophia, honey.

01:19.467 --> 01:21.734
Would you like some celery
stuffed with cottage cheese?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.166
I can't eat cottage cheese.
It repeats on me.

01:26.133 --> 01:30.000
Hello, hello. Hi, Blanche.
How are you, sweet mother?

01:30.066 --> 01:33.233
-We're out of pepperoni.
-Did you call Dan rather?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.200
-I'm starving.
-I defrosted some chicken.

01:37.266 --> 01:40.700
-We'll eat in half an hour.
-I can't eat chicken. It repeats on me.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.300
Look, ma, you don't
have to make excuses.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.633
If you don't want chicken,
just say, I don't want chicken.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.867
-I don't want chicken.
-Good.

01:47.934 --> 01:49.533
It repeats on me.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.700
I want pepperoni.

01:52.767 --> 01:55.300
Blanche, Blanche, would you
like some broiled chicken?

01:55.367 --> 01:57.767
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm having a raw vegetable plate.

01:57.834 --> 02:00.500
You probably haven't noticed it,
but I've put on three pounds.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.200
On each side.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.567
I used to have a waist
just like Scarlett O'Hara.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.333
Well, you know that girl
had an 18-inch waistline.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.867
Blanche, that girl and
her waistline were fiction.

02:13.934 --> 02:17.867
It's terrible, just terrible.
I am so upset!

02:17.934 --> 02:22.867
Rose, Rose. Honey, sit down.
Sweetheart, tell us all about it.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.734
Ma, would you get Rose
some water?

02:25.433 --> 02:27.300
What is she gonna do with water?

02:28.533 --> 02:31.333
Has water ever made you feel
better when you were upset?

02:32.133 --> 02:35.667
Have you ever heard anyone say,
thank God, the water's here!

02:37.900 --> 02:39.834
Call me when dinner is ready.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.166
I'm fine, don't worry about me.
It's all those other people.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.734
Was there some kind of accident?
No, don't tell me.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.066
-If I get upset, I'll eat!
-What happened, Rose?

02:52.133 --> 02:54.166
They closed the center.

02:54.233 --> 02:58.400
-Not your grief counseling center?
-No, the Kennedy Space Center.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.967
She wanted to be the first
Lutheran on the moon.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.600
Rose, you're out of a job!

03:04.667 --> 03:08.100
-Well, I can't worry about that now.
-Well, sure you can, honey.

03:08.166 --> 03:13.633
-I'll help you, food, clothing, shelter.
-Oh, come on, it's not that serious.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.367
Yes, it could be.
Rose, you and I are in the same boat.

03:16.433 --> 03:19.367
If we miss a couple of paychecks,
we are in big trouble.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.734
Thank God I had the
foresight to marry money.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.834
Tramp.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.867
Dorothy, my main concern
is making sure

03:27.934 --> 03:31.800
those miserable people
can find other sources of help.

03:31.867 --> 03:33.567
Then I'll get a job.

03:34.066 --> 03:37.800
I'm dependable, friendly,
loyal, eager.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.533
That's great. If she learns to
catch a Frisbee in her teeth,

03:41.600 --> 03:43.567
she can get work as
a golden retriever.

03:43.633 --> 03:45.166
Oh!

04:10.633 --> 04:11.633
Hello.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.266
Hello.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.467
-I'm Dorothy.
-Milton.

04:22.533 --> 04:24.934
-Oh, pleased to meet you, Milton.
-Likewise.

04:25.467 --> 04:26.700
I live here.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.734
-Oh.
-You don't.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.400
-I live over on Dorado.
-Ah.

04:33.467 --> 04:37.133
It's about a 20-minute walk...
but I usually take the bus.

04:37.967 --> 04:40.400
Are you waiting for one now?

04:42.400 --> 04:45.934
No, I'm learning to get in touch
with my emotions.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.667
Tell me, will it take long?

04:48.734 --> 04:51.834
-You know, you're reading my<i> Newsweek.</i>
-Oh, I'm sorry.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.467
Oh, Dorothy, I see you met Milton.

04:54.533 --> 04:58.533
Oh, yes. We were just getting acquainted.
Dump him, Rose. He's driftwood.

05:00.900 --> 05:05.166
Oh, no, Dorothy.
Milton's from the center.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.900
His partner ran off with his wife
and all the money from the business.

05:08.967 --> 05:12.900
Oh, Milton, I'm sorry.
Keep the<i> Newsweek.</i>

05:13.567 --> 05:16.467
Now, here's the address
of a private counseling service,

05:16.533 --> 05:18.767
and in the meantime,
my number's down there at the bottom.

05:18.834 --> 05:22.166
Now, don't hesitate to call anytime,
day or night.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.467
(mouthing) day or night?

05:25.433 --> 05:27.834
-Thanks again, Rose.
-Oh, you're welcome, Milton.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.500
-You let me know how it works out.
-I certainly will.

05:30.567 --> 05:33.734
-And no more tears.
-All right. Bye.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.200
He's such a royal pain in the butt...

05:40.467 --> 05:42.467
...but it's all part of my job.

05:42.533 --> 05:46.133
-You don't have a job, remember?
-I haven't forgotten, Dorothy.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.066
I've just been too busy to start looking.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.600
You haven't even started looking?

05:51.066 --> 05:53.667
Don't worry, will you? I will get a job.

05:53.734 --> 05:57.033
There's always a job for people
who aren't afraid of hard work.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.300
That's what my father used to say.

05:58.367 --> 06:01.266
He was talking about
milking cows in Minnesota!

06:02.333 --> 06:05.233
-Here, phone messages.
-Oh, thank you, Sophia.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.166
If you have to go out tomorrow,
ask those crybabies

06:08.233 --> 06:10.834
not to call during
<i>The Young and the Restless.</i>

06:14.100 --> 06:15.967
Mr. Viner's depressed.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.867
Mrs. Gibson's despondent.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.233
Mr. Duvalier's been deported.

06:25.100 --> 06:29.734
-Why, oh, why can't grief take a holiday?
-Oh, it does, Rose, it does.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.934
Eventually, it comes to Miami,
like everyone else.

06:34.333 --> 06:37.200
Oh, my God. I don't believe it!

06:38.266 --> 06:40.667
Barry Glick is in town.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.100
Oh, I haven't seen him
since high school. (kisses)

06:44.166 --> 06:48.567
Barry Glick! Ma, ma,
look, look, Barry Glick!

06:48.633 --> 06:51.800
Oh, boy, did I have the hots for him!

06:53.166 --> 06:55.767
He says he wants to
get together next week.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.333
-You're gonna see him?
-See him?

06:57.400 --> 07:00.867
If he's within 50 pounds of where he used
to be, I'm gonna marry him!

07:01.734 --> 07:04.000
Oh, Barry Glick.

07:04.066 --> 07:08.433
Oh, and Mrs. Montez found her cat.
I'll bet she's happy too.

07:08.500 --> 07:12.400
Not exactly. She found it
under a jeep wagoneer.

07:23.367 --> 07:27.033
Rose! Rose!

07:30.266 --> 07:32.667
Rose, will you wake up?
You have a call.

07:34.100 --> 07:39.767
-Is it time to milk the cows, daddy?
-No, kitten. You have a phone call.

07:40.567 --> 07:42.000
What did you say, Dorothy?

07:42.066 --> 07:46.834
You have a phone call.
It's your friend Milton.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.133
No, I can't believe
he's calling at this hour!

07:49.200 --> 07:53.467
-Well, you told him to call day or night.
-I didn't mean it. It's an expression,

07:53.533 --> 07:55.266
like, "laugh and the world
laughs with you."

07:55.333 --> 07:57.400
Well, the whole world
doesn't really laugh.

07:59.066 --> 08:01.900
That's because they're too busy calling
here in the middle of the night.

08:01.967 --> 08:03.533
Good night, Rose!

08:04.133 --> 08:05.633
(both scream)

08:06.266 --> 08:09.233
I hate phone calls
in the middle of the night.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.367
Now I'll never get back to sleep.

08:11.433 --> 08:14.233
I'm as jumpy as a virgin
at a prison rodeo.

08:19.467 --> 08:22.300
Boy, that's... pretty jumpy.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.700
-Well, didn't the phone scare you?
-Well, of course it did.

08:27.767 --> 08:30.633
One of those times I really
miss having a man around.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.166
They're so good at answering the phone
in the middle of the night.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.800
That's not all they're good at.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.100
(Sophia) And when they're really good,
you don't even hear the phone.

08:42.867 --> 08:46.734
Ma, why are you
sitting here in the dark?

08:46.800 --> 08:49.500
Why not? I've seen the living room before.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.700
Look, look. I've got to get some rest.

08:52.767 --> 08:56.700
Tomorrow I am seeing Barry Glick
for the first time in 35 years.

08:56.767 --> 09:00.633
If I don't get at least six hours' sleep,
I look like Buddy Ebsen!

09:01.967 --> 09:04.633
-Now that you mention it--
-Shut up, Blanche.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.867
Oh, I know it. You're right.
It's just terrible.

09:06.934 --> 09:08.934
If I get up in the middle of the night,
I eat.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.633
Wait a minute, you know something?
We're being selfish.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.500
I mean, Rose's problem is
more important than my date.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.533
-Or my losing two pounds.
-Three pounds.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.133
She has to face reality.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.800
I am. I already lost one pound!

09:26.266 --> 09:27.767
In your dreams.

09:29.467 --> 09:33.000
I'm talking about Rose.
She has to find a job.

09:33.066 --> 09:34.934
She's been out of work
for over a week.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.734
I am really sorry about this, girls.
It won't happen again.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.200
-Now come on. We can all go back--
-No, wait. Rose, sit down.

09:41.266 --> 09:43.667
Move over, move over.
Now, listen.

09:44.033 --> 09:47.500
We have something to talk to you about.
We are worried about you.

09:47.567 --> 09:51.266
Now, maybe it's none of our business,
but all that time that you spend

09:51.333 --> 09:55.567
with those pathetic wimps from the center,
you should spend looking for a job.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.500
But those wimps need me.

09:57.567 --> 09:59.934
But, Rose, honey,
you have your own problems.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.700
Look. You are 55, unemployed,

10:02.767 --> 10:04.967
your husband is dead,
and you have no training.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.900
Let's face it, Rose.
You're not exactly Mary Lou Retton.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.967
Honey, we know it's not easy,
but you got to get out there and try.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.567
I have tried. I just haven't told you.

10:15.900 --> 10:19.266
I've had dozens of job interviews
since the center closed.

10:19.333 --> 10:23.066
No one wants me.
I can't afford not to work.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.734
I need something to do with my life.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.400
I never think of myself as old,
but everyone else does.

10:29.667 --> 10:34.533
Maybe I am old... old and useless...
and terrified.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.667
(door slams)

10:51.333 --> 10:52.333
(knock on door)

10:53.233 --> 10:54.233
Come in.

10:58.934 --> 11:00.433
Oh, Rose.

11:01.800 --> 11:07.867
Rose, honey, now why didn't you
tell us what was going on?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.867
Because you can't help me find a job.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.967
Because nobody or nothing
can make me young again.

11:14.033 --> 11:18.200
Oh, all right, Rose, so your life isn't
the same as it used to be.

11:18.266 --> 11:21.400
The rules have changed,
but it's happened before, hasn't it?

11:21.467 --> 11:23.667
I mean, what did you do
after Charlie died?

11:24.967 --> 11:26.100
Buried him.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.367
I mean, what did you do the next day

11:30.433 --> 11:33.200
when you had to start
putting your life together?

11:33.266 --> 11:37.133
I couldn't do it.
I'd been a housewife for 32 years.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.266
I totally depended on Charlie.

11:39.333 --> 11:42.166
But the point is, eventually you did
what you had to do.

11:42.233 --> 11:43.800
You took care of yourself.

11:43.867 --> 11:46.066
Sweetheart, you're now in
exactly the same position.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.800
Not exactly.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.967
I'm five years older...
and nobody wants me around.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.533
Oh, honey, we want you around.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.266
We just can't afford to pay you.

11:57.667 --> 12:00.033
Rose, Rose, look at me.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.233
Rose, listen.
You are feeling sorry for yourself.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.767
Sure, you're five years older.
So am I, so is Blanche.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.500
All right.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.500
You have a few more wrinkles...
so do I, so has Blanche.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.567
All right, you're a little thicker around
the middle. So is Blanche!

12:25.500 --> 12:29.567
Listen, we are not going to stand by
and just let you give up.

12:29.834 --> 12:33.033
We're gonna figure out what it is
you're doing wrong on these interviews.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.200
We're gonna fix it, and we're gonna try
and get you some more appointments.

12:36.266 --> 12:40.734
Appointments are the easy part.
I've got one tomorrow.

12:41.467 --> 12:43.333
I'd kill for this job...

12:43.800 --> 12:47.000
hospital administrator,
but I'll never get it.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.300
I'm not qualified. I'm too old.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.900
-What time is your appointment?
-8:30.

12:50.967 --> 12:54.166
All right, let me see your resume.
Come on, come on, come on.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.500
Ok, now, let's see. Let's see.

12:57.567 --> 13:01.233
What's it? "Home ec major
at Rockport Community College,

13:01.300 --> 13:05.533
six months at St. Paul's business school,
32 years of marriage,

13:05.600 --> 13:08.200
laid off from your job
at grief counseling.

13:08.266 --> 13:10.333
Hobbies: cheese-making...

13:17.834 --> 13:19.433
stamp collecting...

13:20.000 --> 13:22.567
and Viking history"?

13:26.166 --> 13:30.100
-Rose, this stinks.
-Well, it's the truth.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.266
Honey, sometimes you
have to stretch the truth.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.734
Of course you do. Now, let's see.
Graduated top of your class.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.600
Intensive postgraduate study.

13:39.934 --> 13:46.867
32 years with the same employer
until you moved to Miami.

13:47.166 --> 13:54.166
Currently seeking work
in the private sector.

13:54.667 --> 13:59.433
<i>Voila</i>. This is the resume of a potential
hospital administrator.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.367
Well, I don't know if I can pull it off,
but I'm willing to try.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.700
Oh, good.
Now we can get some sleep.

14:06.767 --> 14:10.500
-Oh, I can't fall asleep now.
-Still at the rodeo, Blanche?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.633
I can't sleep, either. Why don't
I make us all some warm milk?

14:17.700 --> 14:21.300
After I drink milk, I go right to sleep.

14:21.867 --> 14:25.533
I can think of something else after which
I go right to sleep. Huh, Dorothy?

14:26.433 --> 14:27.567
During.

14:31.567 --> 14:34.400
-Girls, we can't drink plain milk.
-Why not?

14:34.467 --> 14:37.333
It's disgusting. If we're gonna have milk,
we need cookies.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.066
Hell, if I'm gonna have cookies,
I'm gonna have cheesecake.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.400
-Is there cheesecake?
-Chocolate cheesecake.

14:42.467 --> 14:45.033
-You bought chocolate cheesecake?
-Just for an emergency.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.233
-What kind of emergency, nuclear war?
-Depression.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.934
-Oh, you'll never guess what I found!
-Judge Crater.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.934
Cookies and cream ice cream,
my favorite.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.600
Wait a minute. We're eating dessert.
We can't start with dessert.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.533
If we're gonna have dessert,
we better have something to begin with.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.266
Sure. You can have some lemon chicken
and smoked ham. It's all prepared.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.867
-Oh, let's just start with appetizers.
-That's fine.

15:09.934 --> 15:12.066
-How about smoked oysters?
-Oh, good.

15:13.133 --> 15:16.734
Oh, you'll never guess what I found!

15:16.800 --> 15:17.967
Jimmy Hoffa.

15:19.633 --> 15:20.734
Pepperoni!

15:20.800 --> 15:22.533
-Uh-oh.
-Don't tell mom.

15:23.633 --> 15:26.400
-That could be an appetizer.
-Well, this is good.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.467
-This is all food that would have spoiled.
-Oh, boy.

15:31.367 --> 15:34.500
I am so glad that my date
with Barry is tomorrow.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.367
-The fat won't have time to show.
-It won't?

15:38.433 --> 15:41.166
No. It always takes
a few days before it shows.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.333
Where does it go in the meantime?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.066
To Connecticut!
How do I know where it goes?

15:46.700 --> 15:49.967
With me, the minute it goes in my mouth,
I balloon up.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.600
I can go out to dinner,
and in the middle of the meal,

15:52.667 --> 15:54.867
my pants are cutting off
my circulation so bad,

15:54.934 --> 15:56.400
my feet are turning blue.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.467
Well, I just want to be svelte for Barry.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.867
Barry Glick is very important to you.

16:03.934 --> 16:05.300
(sighs)

16:05.834 --> 16:09.533
Barry was the man
that I wanted to be the first.

16:10.233 --> 16:11.600
First where?

16:12.567 --> 16:16.400
On Mars, Rose! My first lover.

16:16.467 --> 16:17.700
Well, so what happened?

16:18.300 --> 16:20.300
Stanley, that's what happened.

16:20.567 --> 16:24.000
Stanley. I went to a drive-in
with Stanley.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.667
He said he was being shipped off
to Korea and would probably die

16:27.734 --> 16:29.166
and it would mean so much.

16:30.467 --> 16:33.066
That was my part of the war effort.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.667
It took three seconds.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.800
I wasn't sure that we had
done anything, actually...

16:42.233 --> 16:45.133
until nine months later,
when the baby came.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.166
Then I figured out that we had.

16:48.033 --> 16:49.667
You know, that was my only proof.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.767
I waited till my wedding night.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.834
No!

16:58.133 --> 17:00.834
-Yes!
-And?

17:00.900 --> 17:03.767
And... it was a surprise.

17:05.033 --> 17:07.500
How is that possible?
Another man showed up?

17:10.266 --> 17:15.567
What I mean is...
I had never seen a man before.

17:21.967 --> 17:22.967
A man?

17:24.033 --> 17:26.800
You know... a man.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.567
-No!
-Yes!

17:31.433 --> 17:36.333
What about your father?
You mean, you never saw your father?

17:36.967 --> 17:41.100
My father? Oh, no! My father?

17:41.166 --> 17:43.767
Oh, my goodness, no!
I would have simply died!

17:43.834 --> 17:46.633
-Oh, you don't... oh, my God!
-Easy, easy, easy, Rose.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.567
-Calm down, calm down. Easy!
-All right!

17:50.767 --> 17:53.767
The only things I ever saw
were the animals on the farm...

17:54.133 --> 17:56.433
you know, the bulls and the horses.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.867
Tough act to follow.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.400
Actually, that first night...

18:09.967 --> 18:15.333
I was kind of, well... appalled, I guess.

18:16.066 --> 18:20.800
But Charlie was very patient.
It was really very nice...

18:21.133 --> 18:24.367
once I understood that that's
what you were supposed to do...

18:25.567 --> 18:28.300
...that it wasn't some colossal joke,
you know?

18:31.767 --> 18:35.967
I mean, didn't you think it was a
ridiculous thing to do the first time?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.500
No!

18:40.166 --> 18:42.767
Well, I certainly didn't wait
for my wedding night, honey.

18:42.834 --> 18:45.033
I couldn't. I had these urges.

18:46.900 --> 18:51.033
You know, in the south,
we mature faster. I think it's the heat.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.133
I think it's the gin.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.967
Anyhow, my first was Billy.

19:01.033 --> 19:04.300
Oh, I remember it so well,
just like it was yesterday.

19:04.967 --> 19:09.567
That night under the dogwood trees,
the air thick with perfume...

19:10.066 --> 19:11.333
and me with Billy...

19:12.800 --> 19:13.867
or Bobby.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.300
Yeah, Bobby. Yeah, it was Bobby...

19:18.834 --> 19:20.333
or was it Ben?

19:21.400 --> 19:24.300
Oh, who knows?
Anyway, it started with a B.

19:28.100 --> 19:32.633
That first time... did you have...?

19:39.734 --> 19:41.233
Are you serious?

19:41.633 --> 19:44.567
Why, many times that first time.
Many, many times!

19:46.934 --> 19:49.533
-You did?
-You didn't?

19:49.600 --> 19:50.800
No!

19:51.567 --> 19:55.266
Oh, it was nice,
being near Charlie was nice...

19:55.800 --> 19:59.900
but it was five years before I knew what
made your eyes go back in your head.

20:05.333 --> 20:09.433
Dorothy, did you have...?

20:09.934 --> 20:14.133
How could I? I mean, it always seemed to
happen before I was in the room.

20:17.967 --> 20:22.033
-Look what we've eaten!
-Oh, and I can't sleep on a full stomach.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.233
Look at what time it is.
Would you like some coffee?

20:24.300 --> 20:26.967
Sure. How 'bout some Danish?
It's almost breakfast.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.967
-Hey, want some eggs?
-Sure!

20:29.033 --> 20:30.533
-Do we have any bacon?
-Yeah.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.834
-Scramble me a couple, but--
-Scramble soft!

20:32.900 --> 20:36.333
(overlapping chatter)

20:40.233 --> 20:42.166
You're a wonderful woman, Blanche.

20:42.934 --> 20:44.200
No offense to Rose,

20:44.266 --> 20:46.300
but I'm glad she wasn't here
when I dropped by today.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.000
Why, Milton, what a sweet thing to say.

20:49.066 --> 20:51.500
That must be why I date
more than she does.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.667
And I meant what I said
about that diet of yours.

20:54.734 --> 20:57.433
Men of our generation like
a little meat on their women.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.900
Maybe you don't want
to pinch an inch, but I do.

21:00.967 --> 21:02.400
Ooh, ooh, Milton!

21:02.967 --> 21:05.567
-See you tonight at 7:00.
-Tonight at 7:00, Milton.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.367
Good afternoon.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.967
I thought he belonged
to the other one.

21:10.033 --> 21:12.300
Well, I'm sure Rose
won't mind one bit.

21:12.367 --> 21:14.834
He's a man.
It's not like sharing a yogurt.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.066
-Hello, hello, hello!
-(Blanche) Hi, Dorothy.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.133
-Honey, did Barry call?
-Not that I know of.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.066
We're supposed to go out again.
Sounds like lunch went well.

21:23.133 --> 21:24.133
Oh, we had such fun.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.633
You know, Barry is
exactly as I remember him.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.066
Come on, now. After 35 years,
there must have been some surprises.

21:31.133 --> 21:35.233
Well, a few. You know, his hair's a little
thinner, he's put on a little weight.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.967
But is he still your fantasy lover
or has the fantasy become a reality?

21:39.033 --> 21:41.633
Well, not exactly.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.266
You see, Barry Glick is gay.

21:44.867 --> 21:46.433
I knew he was gay.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.433
I could tell by the way he
used to worship Buster Crabbe.

21:51.233 --> 21:55.633
-Oh, honey, are you just devastated?
-Oh, hey, what the hell?

21:55.700 --> 21:59.300
I mean, if I can't have him, at least I
know no other woman can have him, either.

21:59.867 --> 22:01.133
-Hi, girls!
-Oh, hi there!

22:01.200 --> 22:04.200
Hey, are we to assume
from your cheerful demeanor

22:04.266 --> 22:07.133
that we are talking
to a new hospital administrator?

22:07.567 --> 22:08.900
Not even close.

22:08.967 --> 22:11.100
Oh, what did you do,
take an antidepressant?

22:11.166 --> 22:12.767
Oh, don't be silly.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.000
But I was depressed,
incredibly depressed.

22:16.066 --> 22:18.533
I didn't know which way
to turn or where to go,

22:18.600 --> 22:21.867
so I stopped in at the coffee shop
at the Fountain Rock

22:21.934 --> 22:24.467
for a root beer float
to make me feel better.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.734
They make the most terrific
root beer float.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.433
They have that old-fashioned
root beer--

22:28.500 --> 22:31.734
Now look, Rose, get off the float.
Just get to the point.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.300
Well, after I drank it,
I started to get sad again,

22:35.367 --> 22:38.467
and then I saw the answer
right in front of me.

22:38.533 --> 22:40.767
-What, what?
-A "help wanted" sign.

22:40.834 --> 22:42.467
-Oh?
-And, and?

22:42.533 --> 22:46.467
I am a waitress at the
Fountain Rock coffee shop!

22:50.700 --> 22:54.567
12 hours a day, four days
a week, minimum wage and tips,

22:54.633 --> 22:57.967
and a 60% employee discount
on day-old Danish!

22:59.467 --> 23:00.600
Huh?

23:01.633 --> 23:03.233
A coffee shop?

23:04.567 --> 23:07.333
-Day-old Danish.
-Yeah!

23:07.400 --> 23:10.200
12-hour days in a steamy hash joint

23:10.266 --> 23:12.567
serving chili to a bunch
of grubby truckers?

23:12.633 --> 23:13.900
Oh, come on, Blanche.

23:13.967 --> 23:16.233
I mean, she's working
at the Fountain Rock.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.767
It's not Mel's diner.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.433
I mean, the worst that can happen
is she'll get scratched by a pinkie ring.

23:23.567 --> 23:26.500
But 12 hours on your feet,
waiting tables?

23:26.567 --> 23:29.934
Honey, that is gritty,
grimy, grueling work!

23:30.000 --> 23:34.266
But it's work! It beats the hell
out of feeling sorry for myself,

23:34.333 --> 23:38.533
and it'll be a lot nicer to fall asleep
from being tired than crying.

23:38.600 --> 23:44.300
Of course it will. Oh, Rose, honey.
Rose, I am so happy for you.

23:44.367 --> 23:46.834
Well, heck, if you're happy,
then I'm happy, too.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.967
Oh, thank you for
seeing me through this.

23:49.033 --> 23:50.867
Honey, I wanted to ask you about Milton,

23:50.934 --> 23:52.367
-from the center?
-Yes.

23:52.433 --> 23:54.533
That is strictly a professional
relationship?

23:54.600 --> 23:58.867
Oh, absolutely! Oh, there couldn't be
anything between Milton and me.

23:58.934 --> 24:02.066
He has this thing about
only dating fat women.
