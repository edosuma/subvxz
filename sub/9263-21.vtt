34:57.596 --> 35:00.432
watch some game film.

I'm sorry to bother you,
I just...

40:28.426 --> 40:31.179
I just thought we should
talk about some things.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.180
And clear some things up.

40:32.221 --> 40:36.100
You made everything
completely clear last night

40:36.100 --> 40:37.101
when I saw you with Suzy.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.187
I know you're upset,
but I really need you to‐‐

40:39.228 --> 40:40.438
I'm not upset.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.608
I finally know
the truth about us.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.443
You didn't have the guts
to tell me,

40:45.443 --> 40:46.611
but now I know.

40:46.611 --> 40:50.114
And now we can both move on.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.201
Please don't come back.

I'm sorry for the way

I'll tell you what, though.

Come to bed with me.
