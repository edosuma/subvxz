Narrator:
Coming up, what's got Q
moving at a good clip?

00:17.467 --> 00:19.733
Narrator: Why is Murr
protecting and serving?

00:19.767 --> 00:21.867
All right, sir,
I'm taking you in.
That's it.

00:23.267 --> 00:24.600
And which losing joker

00:24.633 --> 00:27.700
won't have a fighting chance
in tonight's punishment?

00:27.733 --> 00:28.600
All: Ohh!

00:29.733 --> 00:32.500
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.567
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.300 --> 00:36.900
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:38.733 --> 00:41.433
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:41.467 --> 00:43.533
Joe: Larry!

00:47.267 --> 00:49.000
Today, we're in the park
asking strangers

00:49.033 --> 00:50.333
to help us
cover our tracks.

00:50.367 --> 00:51.933
While chatting
the stranger up,

00:51.967 --> 00:53.700
a person we've been
trying to avoid

00:53.733 --> 00:55.633
is gonna enter the park
looking for us.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.367
The catch is,
the ridiculous reason

00:57.400 --> 00:58.467
we've been dodging them

00:58.500 --> 01:00.167
is given to us
by the other guys.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.067
If the stranger
doesn't cover for you,

01:02.067 --> 01:04.100
you lose.
You haven't seen me.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.867
Where's Joe?
He's right there.
He's right there.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.600
**

01:10.633 --> 01:11.700
These pigeons, though.

01:11.733 --> 01:13.700
They get super aggressive,
the pigeons.

01:15.067 --> 01:17.067
Oh, Joe went to a woman.
this is perfect.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.567
Sal: The actress
coming for Joe is, let's say,

01:19.600 --> 01:22.100
she has one of the oldest
professions in the world.
That's right.

01:22.133 --> 01:23.867
You see anyone
peculiar coming, Joe?

01:23.900 --> 01:26.300
Yeah, I mean, the fountain
is my favorite part of --

01:26.333 --> 01:27.467
Oh, geez.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.933
Oh, okay.

01:29.967 --> 01:31.733
See that woman
walking around the thing?

01:31.767 --> 01:33.067
I've been
dodging this girl.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.933
"Apparently she doesn't
take Canadian quarters."

01:37.267 --> 01:39.133
Apparently she doesn't
take Canadian quarters.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.100
He tried to pay a hooker

01:42.133 --> 01:43.800
with Canadian quarters.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.733
I had a romp up
in Crotch Lake, Ontario.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.900
Came back
with a lot of change,

01:49.933 --> 01:51.833
so I didn't have time
to run to the bank, you know?
Ah, that's hilarious.

01:51.867 --> 01:53.233
I don't know
why she's putting this on me

01:53.267 --> 01:54.800
'cause you can take them
to any exchange place.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.233
The rate is actually
pretty good right now.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.333
All right,
I'm gonna hide behind this tree.

01:59.367 --> 02:01.067
You didn't see me.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Have a good day.

02:02.267 --> 02:03.333
Hey.

02:03.367 --> 02:06.100
Uh, didn't I see you
talking to my friend Joe?

02:08.833 --> 02:09.867
Oh.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.267
Do you know where he went?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.700
No?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.433
She said no, she doesn't
know where he went.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.067
That big-belly
son of a bitch

02:17.067 --> 02:19.433
paid me
in Canadian quarters.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.933
"One girl to another,
you don't know where he went?"

02:23.967 --> 02:25.967
One girl to another,
do you know where he went?

02:26.067 --> 02:28.633
**

02:30.700 --> 02:32.433
I can't believe girl code
didn't win the day.

02:32.467 --> 02:35.767
Big-belly,
big-nose son of a bitch!

02:38.867 --> 02:40.833
What happened was that stripper
was looking for me

02:40.867 --> 02:42.833
and I hid behind a tree
and she didn't give me up.

02:42.867 --> 02:43.967
It was great.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.100
You heard the whole thing?

02:45.133 --> 02:46.900
Go back in. Go back in.
We're gonna do it again.

02:46.933 --> 02:49.600
Uh-oh, Joe,
she's coming back.

02:49.633 --> 02:50.700
Oh, she's coming back.

02:50.733 --> 02:52.333
You didn't see me,
you didn't see me.

02:55.433 --> 02:59.333
Have you seen this big-nose,
big

03:01.533 --> 03:03.067
It's amazing how you can set up
a loyal allegiance

03:03.100 --> 03:04.233
in two minutes.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.667
Wow.
Q: Uh-huh.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.133
All right,
you have a great day.

03:07.167 --> 03:08.167
I'm late for church.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.200
"I'm late for church."

03:09.233 --> 03:10.567
I'm late for church.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.900
Get your ass
to the exchange bank.

03:16.067 --> 03:18.100
I used to have the Samsung,
the exact same phone.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.200
No joke, last week,

03:19.233 --> 03:20.367
I dropped my entire phone
in the toilet.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.067
100% submerged.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.600
Joe: All right,
we're sending in our actor.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.467
I've always
wanted to say this.
Yeah.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.567
Send in the nun.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.067
See our holy roller?

03:29.067 --> 03:31.267
There she is,
coming down the walkway.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.867
Murr:
Oh, my God.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.067
Oh, shoot, shoot.

03:35.067 --> 03:38.100
You see the, um --
you see the nun over there?

03:38.133 --> 03:39.467
Uh-huh.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.933
Oh, I gave her mono.

03:42.333 --> 03:45.300
She's looking for me.
I gave her mono.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.200
Oh, no.

03:47.233 --> 03:48.367
Yes.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.167
You know, it's the kissing
disease, right?

03:50.200 --> 03:51.667
I volunteer at the church,
right?

03:51.700 --> 03:54.467
You know, all the wine,
the candles, the incense?

03:54.500 --> 03:55.800
The candles lit.

03:55.833 --> 03:56.767
We were drinking.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.700
She was drinking
a little wine.

03:57.733 --> 03:58.533
The candles were lit.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.067
It was so romantic.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.067
I just pounced.

04:02.267 --> 04:04.467
Oh, shoot. Do me a favor,
do me a favor.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.700
You didn't see me.
Cover for me.

04:05.733 --> 04:07.067
You don't know where I am.
Okay.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.333
**

04:12.367 --> 04:13.667
Sal: Look at his face.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.167
He's like, "Please do not
come up to me."

04:16.200 --> 04:19.633
Did I see you
talking to my friend?

04:21.667 --> 04:23.333
Q: He doesn't know
what to say.

04:23.367 --> 04:25.067
You think you might know
where he went?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.100
Oh!

04:29.133 --> 04:31.067
Q: "You wouldn't lie to a nun,
would you?"

04:31.067 --> 04:32.967
You wouldn't lie to a nun,
would you?

04:40.600 --> 04:42.533
But he's lying to a nun.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.300
But do you know
where he is?

04:46.833 --> 04:48.333
Joe: Oh!
Thank you.
Bless you.

04:48.367 --> 04:49.300
Murr:  Yes!

04:49.333 --> 04:51.467
Wow, he lied to a nun!

04:51.500 --> 04:53.067
Look at his face,
look at his face.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.100
Psst. Psst.

04:55.133 --> 04:56.567
Thank you so much.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.867
Q: Look at this.
he's giving thumbs up.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.100
Murr:
Here we go. We're in.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.333
Do you know
when they open the --

05:04.367 --> 05:05.867
Do you know when
they open the fountain?

05:08.067 --> 05:10.167
All right, your man
is entering the park now.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.700
Okay.
Murr: You'll know him
when you see him.

05:11.733 --> 05:12.867
You'll know him
when you see him.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.233
Oh, there he is.

05:15.267 --> 05:16.633
Uh-oh.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.067
-Uh-oh.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.533
He's looking for you.
Sal: He's walking
with a purpose.

05:19.567 --> 05:20.733
See that guy in the black?

05:23.133 --> 05:24.600
Oh, he's looking for me.

05:24.633 --> 05:25.800
"I gave him mono."

05:28.067 --> 05:29.267
Take that, Q.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.700
I gave him mono.

05:30.733 --> 05:32.933
I know.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.400
To be fair...

05:35.433 --> 05:36.967
Murr:
Q, he's getting closer.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.133
I'm gonna go hide
behind that tree.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.233
Do me a favor,

05:39.267 --> 05:40.167
you didn't see me.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.233
**

05:41.267 --> 05:43.500
All right, I'm gonna hide.

05:43.533 --> 05:46.067
**

05:46.067 --> 05:47.233
Excuse me.

05:47.267 --> 05:51.067
Didn't I see you talking
to someone I know?

05:52.367 --> 05:54.433
I didn't see where he went.
That's why I'm asking you.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.467
You sure about that?
Yeah.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.200
Yeah!

06:03.233 --> 06:06.233
That's a stand-up guy
right there.
Wow.

06:06.267 --> 06:08.067
Sal:
Dude, we're good?

06:11.433 --> 06:13.200
Murr: Sal is in.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.167
This is perfect --
not hot, not cold.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.133
That's why --

06:16.167 --> 06:17.567
There's almost
not even a seat.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.433
That's why I --
Sorry I squeezed in.

06:19.467 --> 06:20.733
There was hardly no seats.

06:20.767 --> 06:22.100
All right,
let's send in our actor.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.500
Q: Oh, here she comes.

06:23.533 --> 06:24.867
This one's evil.
I think we got Sal
on this one.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.533
This is evil.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.400
That's it, buddy.
Pigtails is her.

06:29.433 --> 06:31.400
This son of a bitch
is trying to shake me down.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.067
This son
This son

06:34.067 --> 06:36.700
This son of a bitch
in the pigtails,

06:36.733 --> 06:38.267
she's trying
to shake me down.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.600
She tries to bully me
all the time.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.167
You didn't see me.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.967
You don't know
where I am, dude.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.833
Sorry. Please.

06:46.867 --> 06:47.900
**

06:47.933 --> 06:51.067
Joe:
Look at her acting.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.833
Excuse me, sir,
have you seen this guy?

06:53.867 --> 06:55.700
His name is Sal.
He --

06:55.733 --> 06:58.467
I thought I just saw him
talking to you.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.067
Say to him,
"I'm shaking him down."

07:02.067 --> 07:04.700
I'm shaking him down.

07:04.733 --> 07:05.967
Joe:
"He's been dodging me."

07:06.067 --> 07:08.700
He's been dodging me.

07:08.733 --> 07:10.267
"I'm a straight-up bully."

07:10.300 --> 07:12.333
I'm a straight-up bully.

07:12.367 --> 07:14.200
Do you know
where he is?

07:18.200 --> 07:19.900
Are you sure
you didn't see him?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.633
Don't be lying to me!

07:26.567 --> 07:27.767
Joe: You won, bud.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.733
I cannot believe that guy
covered for me.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.367
He told an alone child
in a New York City park

07:32.400 --> 07:34.767
that he doesn't know
where the only adult

07:34.800 --> 07:36.500
that she's with is.

07:36.533 --> 07:37.767
You can't even get me
with a 5-year-old.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.500
Oh, yeah?
Give me one more shot.

07:39.533 --> 07:40.800
I'm not giving you
one more shot.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.500
A lot of talk.
I know!
Oh, the zone, the zone.

07:43.533 --> 07:44.500
What's the matter,
you chicken?

07:44.533 --> 07:45.500
Bawk! Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!

07:45.533 --> 07:47.600
Hey.
I'm not chicken.

07:49.433 --> 07:50.533
I'll go again.

07:50.567 --> 07:52.600
Quick,
swipe to Sal's second turn.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.733
Dude, did you see
anything down here today --

07:55.767 --> 07:57.200
with the Yankees
or anything like that?

07:58.633 --> 08:00.400
Q:
Here we go, Sal, round 2.

08:00.433 --> 08:01.633
There's been
a slight change.

08:01.667 --> 08:04.533
Murr:
Sal, she's soaking wet.
Sal: Oh, my God.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.167
Oh, God, this kid,
this kid right here.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.267
She's come here
looking for me.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.233
Joe:
"She was at the bus stop.

08:10.267 --> 08:11.333
I just raged
through this puddle,

08:11.367 --> 08:12.433
I soaked her."

08:12.467 --> 08:13.500
She was at the bus stop.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.100
I raged through a puddle
and soaked her.

08:16.433 --> 08:19.700
Oh, you didn't see me
if she asks for me.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.967
Q:
Here we go, here we go.

08:24.067 --> 08:27.467
Excuse me, sir,
have you seen this guy?

08:27.500 --> 08:28.567
Well...

08:28.600 --> 08:30.067
"He's got a weird beard."

08:30.067 --> 08:31.667
He has a weird beard.

08:31.700 --> 08:32.700
"He's a bigger guy."

08:32.733 --> 08:34.400
He's a big guy.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.533
He's both.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.333
-They're covering for him.
-No, they're covering for him.

08:44.367 --> 08:46.600
Oh, okay. Thank you.

08:46.633 --> 08:50.367
Go, "Ugh, I smell like
hot, wet trash."

08:50.400 --> 08:52.933
Ugh, I smell like
hot, wet trash.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.667
**

08:57.667 --> 08:58.767
Sal's victorious.
He won.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.433
I cannot believe
they covered for him.

09:00.467 --> 09:01.833
Sal, you got it, buddy.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.833
Narrator:
Everyone covered for the guys,

09:05.867 --> 09:09.267
so no one's hiding out
on the loser board.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.133
Today, we're in the parking lot
of Classic Cleaners,

09:11.167 --> 09:13.067
getting ready to put our hands
on some people's cars.

09:13.067 --> 09:14.133
We'll be going head-to-head,

09:14.167 --> 09:15.567
putting our hand
on people's cars,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.433
and then we have to wait
for them to come out.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.167
You're gonna have to keep
your hands on the car

09:19.200 --> 09:20.533
for as long as you can.

09:20.567 --> 09:22.733
Whoever takes their hand
off the car first loses.

09:22.767 --> 09:25.067
Lots of hands going on.
There's a lot of hands.

09:25.067 --> 09:28.100
**

09:28.133 --> 09:29.067
Q: Here we go.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.267
Sal: She's getting out.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.300
She's walking.
Joe: Yep.

09:33.333 --> 09:34.700
And she's in.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.600
Why are you running?

09:37.633 --> 09:38.700
What does he got?

09:38.733 --> 09:41.433
Joe: Murray's got props.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.067
Murr: Yeah.
Sal: Oh, my God.

09:43.067 --> 09:44.700
You have a badge?

09:44.733 --> 09:46.133
He's got a badge
and everything?

09:46.167 --> 09:47.767
I'm undercover.
I'm undercover.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.533
You're undercover
with a police t

09:49.567 --> 09:51.700
You threw this on.
Look at the way
you're standing.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.633
All right, sir,
I'm taking you in.
That's it.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.533
Okay, ready, Sal?

09:57.567 --> 10:00.067
Joe:
Hands on cars in 1, 2, 3.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.967
There you go.
Sal:
Hey, how are you, miss?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I have a question --
is this you?

10:03.033 --> 10:04.033
I'm looking to lease
this car.

10:04.067 --> 10:05.000
I have a family,
I have three kids.

10:05.033 --> 10:05.967
Do you like it?
Is it safe?

10:07.167 --> 10:08.400
-Ma'am.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.633
Yeah,
my name's Officer Murray,

10:09.667 --> 10:11.100
I'm with
the Kearny Police Department.

10:11.133 --> 10:12.200
Just doing
community outreach,

10:12.233 --> 10:13.533
just wanted to make sure
everything's good.

10:13.567 --> 10:14.700
Good?

10:14.733 --> 10:15.833
Your badge says
"Transit Department."

10:20.200 --> 10:22.567
I cover the Trenton, New Jersey
transit, too.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.467
Do you have any other
identification on you?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.400
A police badge usually
seems like it's enough.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.867
You do have that,
or I don't even know --

10:28.900 --> 10:29.767
What is this?
I don't even --

10:29.800 --> 10:33.000
Ohh!

10:33.033 --> 10:34.967
Sal:
What is going on with you?
I'm undercover.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.033
I don't know.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.767
Murr, you better put
that wig back on, buddy.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.400
How do you put a wig on
with one hand?

10:42.700 --> 10:46.267
I can't! I can't.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.033
I got to put it back on.
Sal: I don't know, man.
I don't know.

10:48.067 --> 10:49.067
Hey, you have a great day,
ma'am.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.767
Thanks so much.
Stay safe, stay safe.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.133
You just picked your hand
off the top of car.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.967
Son of a bitch!

10:59.000 --> 11:00.200
Damn it!

11:00.233 --> 11:01.167
Thank you, miss.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.300
Q:
All right, Joseph.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.600
Joe: All right, buddy,
good luck to you.

11:05.633 --> 11:07.367
Murr:
The hands are on the car

11:07.400 --> 11:10.100
in 3, 2, 1.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.733
Sal:
Here we go, here we go.

11:12.767 --> 11:13.733
Hey, how's it going, man?

11:14.867 --> 11:16.300
Murr:
Joe, what are you doing, bud?

11:16.333 --> 11:18.733
Uh, I got a thing
going on here.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.267
I got a loose filling.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.433
And...

11:22.467 --> 11:24.100
I had to.
It's an emergency.
Yeah.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.767
You know
where there is one?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.933
Which way is it?
Is it this way?

11:28.967 --> 11:30.933
Are you driving that way?

11:30.967 --> 11:32.800
Oh.
Which way you going?

11:35.733 --> 11:37.400
Yeah.
That's right.

11:37.433 --> 11:39.667
-I think it'll be all right.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.433
Murr:
This guy is eyeing you.

11:43.467 --> 11:44.800
I got it, dude,
it's fine.

11:44.833 --> 11:46.433
He's here,
you can walk away now.

11:46.467 --> 11:48.500
This does feel like
one of those setups,

11:48.533 --> 11:49.733
like,
when somebody trips you

11:49.767 --> 11:51.200
and the other guy
steals your wallet.

11:51.233 --> 11:53.533
He just locked his doors.

11:53.567 --> 11:55.067
I just heard the doors lock.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.733
He's public safety.
He knows a thing or two.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.267
Without a doubt,
he's on a super-high alert.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.467
Guys, we'll allow
a one-time switch

12:01.500 --> 12:02.533
to the white car.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.100
Ooh!
Right?

12:04.133 --> 12:05.167
Q: Switch over
to that white car?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.367
Yeah.
All right.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.100
Murr: Go.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.767
Sal: All right
Hands are off.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.367
**

12:12.400 --> 12:14.367
Guys, hands on the car now.

12:15.933 --> 12:17.133
Hi.

12:17.167 --> 12:18.567
Oh, we're just making sure
nobody hits you.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.800
Somebody came through
to side-swipe.

12:19.833 --> 12:21.167
Yeah, they squeezed through
on the side.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.400
It was no good.
It was really tight.

12:22.433 --> 12:23.467
I told him
to watch the side.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.733
What are you doing?

12:24.767 --> 12:27.067
You're not getting
involved in this.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.100
Make out! Make out!
Make out! Make out!

12:29.133 --> 12:30.233
What are you talking about?

12:31.267 --> 12:33.067
I won.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.100
I went for the kiss.

12:36.133 --> 12:38.367
He came so close,
I felt his breath
on my tongue.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.500
Narrator:
Murr and Q were hands off,

12:41.533 --> 12:43.933
so they're first up
on the loser board.

12:43.967 --> 12:45.467
Today,
we're competing head-to-head

12:45.500 --> 12:46.833
clipping ribbons
on strangers.

12:46.867 --> 12:47.867
The first guy

12:47.900 --> 12:49.433
will have to attach a ribbon
to a stranger

12:49.467 --> 12:51.267
once they enter
the designated hot zone.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.567
And the other guy will have
to remove that ribbon

12:53.600 --> 12:55.100
before they leave
the hot zone

12:55.133 --> 12:56.467
without getting caught.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.400
You get caught attaching
or detaching the ribbon,

12:58.433 --> 13:00.600
you lose.
Aah!

13:00.633 --> 13:02.133
Narrator: It's Q and Murr

13:02.167 --> 13:04.600
in a joker vs. joker
challenge.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.433
Here we go.

13:07.467 --> 13:08.933
You're going down.

13:08.967 --> 13:11.067
Come on, come on, come on.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.400
Sal: Murr, you look like you're
getting ready to take a dump.

13:14.767 --> 13:15.800
Come on.

13:17.067 --> 13:18.767
Joe: Murr's in.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.333
There he goes.

13:22.367 --> 13:24.067
Wow, he got it on.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.567
Here we go, here we go.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.733
**

13:26.767 --> 13:28.633
Oh, my God.
Got it, got.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.100
That guy has no idea

13:30.133 --> 13:31.300
that you two
were in his life.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.133
Dude, that was close placement
to the ass too.

13:33.167 --> 13:34.133
that was good.

13:34.167 --> 13:36.067
Q's in, Q's in.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.667
Oh, put it on the beak,
put it on the cap.

13:38.700 --> 13:39.867
Oh, on the cap.
Put it on the brim.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.933
Put it on the bill,
the bill!

13:40.967 --> 13:41.933
Oh, on the brim!
on the brim!

13:42.967 --> 13:43.933
Oh, my God!
He got him!

13:43.967 --> 13:45.333
He didn't catch him,

13:45.367 --> 13:47.233
he didn't catch him.
No, he did not catch him.

13:47.267 --> 13:48.467
He knows something's up...
He knows something's up.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.733
...but he has no idea.

13:49.767 --> 13:51.233
He doesn't know he looks like
a golden pony right now.

13:51.267 --> 13:52.200
Oh, Murr.

13:52.233 --> 13:54.067
**

13:54.067 --> 13:55.867
Careful,
there's flies all around.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.067
Joe: He didn't catch him.
Yeah, be careful.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.800
He didn't catch him!
He didn't catch him.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.400
Sal: Wow.
Oh, that was beautiful.

14:00.433 --> 14:01.633
Let me say something,

14:01.667 --> 14:04.700
you guys came in
hard and fast.
Yeah.

14:04.733 --> 14:09.067
**

14:09.067 --> 14:10.900
And it's been clipped
on the bag.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.900
That's an easy grab.
Oh, my God.

14:11.933 --> 14:13.333
That's an easy grab.

14:16.433 --> 14:17.867
Oh, I'm so sorry!

14:19.233 --> 14:21.200
I stand corrected.

14:21.233 --> 14:22.067
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.167
Easy grab, Joe,
easy grab?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.967
Joe: I stand corrected,
my buddy.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.067
My apologies.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.267
Q:

14:28.300 --> 14:29.967
Narrator:
Murr got tripped up,

14:30.067 --> 14:32.967
so he's tonight's
big loser.

14:33.067 --> 14:36.100
-Murr's it!
-Murr's the loser, everybody!

14:36.133 --> 14:37.367
We got you an invite

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
to this
awesome cocktail party

14:39.433 --> 14:41.367
on a sprawling estate
outside.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.900
Yes. Okay.
Joe:
What we want you to do

14:42.933 --> 14:45.233
is go in there and just mingle
and meet some people.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.367
That's all you know for now,
and that's it.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.067
Joe: So we reached out
to find somebody

14:50.067 --> 14:51.667
who was throwing
a big cocktail party.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.367
He's the only guy
that knows we're here.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.267
None of his guests do.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.533
-Oh, wow.
-Welcome to the event, buddy.

14:58.567 --> 15:00.133
Murr: This is amazing.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.500
It's nice, right?
Look at this invite we scored.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.167
Q: This is
the exact type of party

15:04.200 --> 15:06.900
that I've never been invited to
in my entire life right here.

15:06.933 --> 15:09.867
Sal:
Murr, just scan the party.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.333
Looks like a great
summer cocktail party.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.067
There's violinists playing.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.933
We invited another friend
to this party.

15:15.967 --> 15:18.333
Turn to your right.
Over your right shoulder,
bud.

15:18.367 --> 15:20.300
You'll see our friend Kayla.

15:20.333 --> 15:24.067
She's a two-time gold medal
Olympic judoist.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.633
This is your punishment,
you ready?

15:27.667 --> 15:28.633
Take her out.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.200
Murr: What do you mean,
"Take her out"?

15:34.233 --> 15:35.400
You have to pin her.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.333
Wait, wait.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.833
What's my explanation?

15:40.867 --> 15:42.167
Sal: No explanation.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.333
If anyone approaches you at all
about the grappling,

15:44.367 --> 15:45.900
your response is only,

15:45.933 --> 15:46.933
"My friend from college."

15:49.267 --> 15:50.433
Don't even say "friend."

15:50.467 --> 15:51.733
"I know her from college."

15:51.767 --> 15:53.067
Ah! That's better.
That's it.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.167
"I know her from college."

15:54.200 --> 15:55.467
Y-y-you --

15:55.500 --> 15:57.233
Hi. Could I get a --

16:02.533 --> 16:03.933
So you want me to go,
you want me to go?

16:03.967 --> 16:05.100
-Go, go, go.
-You can say hi to her.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.133
Joe:
She knows what the deal is.

16:06.167 --> 16:08.267
Hi. How are you?

16:11.233 --> 16:12.367
Ready and go.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.633
Kayla, right?
Yeah.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.200
We know each other
from college?

16:15.233 --> 16:16.833
We do?
We know each other
from college.

16:31.633 --> 16:34.733
Q: Oh! Oh, my God!

16:34.767 --> 16:36.300
Murr:

16:36.333 --> 16:38.767
Dude, it's almost over.
The party ends at sundown.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.600
What? Come on.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.167
Oh, there's a couple
more people around her.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.867
Yes, this will be a little
bit more interesting.

16:44.900 --> 16:45.967
Excuse me, sorry.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.500
**

16:47.533 --> 16:49.233
Woman: How can we get people
on the dance floor?

16:49.267 --> 16:51.900
Yeah, that's it.
Start dancing, come on.

16:51.933 --> 16:54.067
Say, "Excuse me for a second,"
and go after Kayla again.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.600
Excuse me one second.

16:56.633 --> 17:00.133
**

17:00.167 --> 17:02.733
Q:

17:02.767 --> 17:05.300
Joe: She's just swatting you
like a fly.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.900
Joe:
You're in finance?

17:08.800 --> 17:11.400
Murr:
How's your day going, guys?

17:11.433 --> 17:13.833
Yeah,
I know her from college.
Oh, okay.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.367
This is great,
this is fantastic.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.433
Where'd you get that?

17:17.400 --> 17:18.933
Joe: There she is.

17:18.967 --> 17:20.200
"Oh, excuse me one minute."

17:20.233 --> 17:22.833
Excuse me one second.
I'm sorry.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.233
**

17:29.767 --> 17:31.233
Sal: Oh! Oh!

17:32.900 --> 17:34.267
I give, I give, I give.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.067
I give, I give.

17:39.733 --> 17:40.767
What's that?

17:41.967 --> 17:44.067
We know each other from college,
it's fine.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.200
This is so stupid.

17:49.233 --> 17:51.233
Kayla, do you need
a full-time job just
following us around

17:51.267 --> 17:53.500
doing this to Murray
at any time we tell you to?

17:53.533 --> 17:54.833
It's hot, huh?
Oh, my gosh.

17:54.867 --> 17:55.933
Hi, guys. I'm James.

17:55.967 --> 17:57.567
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.633
Q:
Here we go, here we go.

17:58.667 --> 17:59.633
Go take her down.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.367
Excuse me one second.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.500
Excuse me one second.

18:02.533 --> 18:05.167
**

18:19.700 --> 18:21.533
I know her from college.

18:23.433 --> 18:24.967
Sal: Look at his hair.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.233
It's on the wrong way.

18:27.267 --> 18:29.833
You look like
a New Age yoga teacher

18:29.867 --> 18:31.633
that came home
from a week-long bender.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.767
Murr:
I'm enjoying the party.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.433
t's a lovely day.

18:35.467 --> 18:36.600
Yes.

18:36.633 --> 18:37.833
I know it's a little --

18:39.500 --> 18:42.100
Q: Oh, here we go.

18:42.133 --> 18:44.333
Joe: "Excuse me,
I see somebody from college."

18:44.367 --> 18:45.533
Give me one second,

18:45.567 --> 18:46.967
I see somebody
from college.
Okay.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.500
Hey.

18:50.533 --> 18:55.100
**

18:55.133 --> 18:56.533
No!

18:56.567 --> 18:57.767
All: Ohh!

18:58.867 --> 19:01.367
Sal: Oh, my God!
Q: Oh, my God!

19:01.400 --> 19:03.267
Joe:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

19:03.300 --> 19:05.067
Oh, my God!

19:06.167 --> 19:07.567
Sal: Oh, my God!

19:07.600 --> 19:08.867
**

19:11.567 --> 19:14.100
That was unbelievable.

19:14.133 --> 19:18.400
Holy crap.

19:18.433 --> 19:19.767
In a million years,

19:19.800 --> 19:21.900
I never would have been able
to guess this punishment.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.100
I'm James.
Nice to meet you.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.567
Oh, no, no, no.
It's -- you know.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.900
Oh, my God,
we didn't even think of that.

19:28.933 --> 19:30.533
Throw him in the water.
Sal:

19:30.567 --> 19:32.733
Murr, thanks so much.
Hey, Kayla.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.267
This just in --
Hey, Kayla.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.667
Could you go
stand by the pool?

19:35.700 --> 19:38.067
**

19:38.067 --> 19:39.433
Oh, she's right
next to the pool.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.300
You should go say hi.
You know her from college.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.200
There you are, Kayla!

19:43.233 --> 19:44.633
There you are!

19:44.667 --> 19:46.200
Hey!

19:46.233 --> 19:48.233
It's James.

19:48.267 --> 19:49.833
Hi, Kayla.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.600
Hi, hi.

19:51.633 --> 19:52.433
**

19:52.467 --> 19:53.500
Murr: Oh, geez.

19:53.533 --> 19:55.433
Oh, no, no! No, no, no, no!
No, no!

19:58.233 --> 20:00.033
Sal: Yes! Yes!

20:00.067 --> 20:02.233
-Look at that!
-Yes!

20:03.300 --> 20:04.267
You go, girl.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.233
-And there it is, boys.

20:09.267 --> 20:10.933
Q:
Oh, that was unbelievable.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.700
I know her from college
is the thing.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.933
**

20:25.100 --> 20:26.867
Sal: Oh, my God.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.400
Casey: Welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

20:29.567 --> 20:31.367
We're gonna give you
a behind-the-scenes look

20:31.400 --> 20:32.867
of how this punishment happened

20:32.900 --> 20:34.500
and bonus footage
from tonight's episode.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.500
Making mostly breakaway tables
today, huh?

20:39.533 --> 20:41.667
Uh, breakaway table,

20:41.700 --> 20:43.367
and we're putting
a camera guy in a tree,

20:43.400 --> 20:44.667
so I had to get
the platform.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.733
Putting someone in a tree?
What are they gonna be wearing?

20:46.767 --> 20:48.433
A ghillie suit.
What is that?

20:48.467 --> 20:49.967
Ghillie suit's like
what the military uses.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.900
It's that, like, you know,
green, black, and white thing.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.467
-There we go.
-Oh, my God!

20:55.567 --> 20:57.900
Man: Okay, here we go.
3, 2, 1.

20:57.933 --> 20:59.200
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:59.233 --> 21:01.633
James "Murr" Murray
is tonight's loser.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.333
What do I have to do?
Joe: Party.

21:03.367 --> 21:04.700
You got to party, Murray.
Have a drink, relax.

21:04.733 --> 21:05.700
Dance a little bit.

21:05.733 --> 21:06.700
I feel like

21:06.733 --> 21:08.067
there's something else
going on here.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.700
It should be like,
"I feel" -- swipe.

21:12.533 --> 21:14.433
Q: Here we go.
Hey.

21:14.467 --> 21:15.933
Hi, everybody. Hi.

21:15.967 --> 21:17.400
Woman: Whoa! Oh!

21:26.667 --> 21:28.067
Every time I approach her,

21:28.067 --> 21:30.067
she takes my wig off
and smacks me.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.700
I'm really
fighting the heat today...
Yes.

21:33.733 --> 21:35.200
...also the Olympiad.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.567
"Judo"
what I'm talking about?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.633
Aah! Oh, no!

21:41.667 --> 21:43.167
-Oh, here we go!
-No, no!

21:43.200 --> 21:45.067
All: Oh!

21:45.067 --> 21:46.700
-Look at that!
-Yes!

21:46.733 --> 21:48.467
She's awesome.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.233
I think I'm falling in love
with her a little.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.433
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.833
That was unbelievable.

21:53.867 --> 21:55.167
Holy crap.

21:56.700 --> 21:57.767
How do you feel, bud?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.433
I feel soaking wet, Casey.

21:59.467 --> 22:01.300
I mean, you look wet.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.300
That was brutal.
Oh, my God.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.967
She handed my ass to me.
It was so fun--

22:06.067 --> 22:07.933
Sal: Oh! Ohh!

22:07.967 --> 22:09.133
Murr:
Okay, I give, I give, I give.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.200
Well, she threw me.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.133
And she threw Joe Imburgio.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.733
Sorry.

22:16.767 --> 22:17.933
And then she threw Eric.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.233
Sal: Oh, my God!

22:19.267 --> 22:21.867
That was the best thing
I've ever seen in my life.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.300
Casey:
You went the quickest.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.633
Well, I a --
I'm a b-boy, that's why.

22:24.667 --> 22:25.633
Murr: Oh

22:25.667 --> 22:28.167
All: Ohh!

22:28.200 --> 22:31.067
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

22:31.100 --> 22:32.700
I'm sorry to ruin
their goddamn party.

22:32.733 --> 22:34.533
How do you feel the party went?

22:34.567 --> 22:36.100
I think the party went great.

22:36.133 --> 22:37.733
I would definitely
come back here for a party

22:37.767 --> 22:39.300
if I'm ever
invited again.
Yeah, yeah.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.633
I know, I know.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.433
I think you'd be invited again.
I'm not sure about Murr.

22:42.467 --> 22:43.467
Do you have a beverage?

22:43.500 --> 22:44.833
I just got thrown
through a table.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.067
I didn't know
I had an inner bully in me,

22:48.100 --> 22:49.133
but apparently...
No.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.333
...I've been, like,
keeping that --

22:50.367 --> 22:51.667
That's the thing
that was the best.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.800
You didn't come off mean.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.200
It was, like,
he was always going for you.

22:54.233 --> 22:55.567
It was, like,
almost all self-defense.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.633
Yeah, so I was like --

22:56.667 --> 22:58.267
It was self-defense,
but I just had to, like,

22:58.300 --> 22:59.333
let him know, like,
I was boss.

22:59.367 --> 23:00.833
Do you submit?

23:00.867 --> 23:02.067
Oh, yeah.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.167
Yeah, I'm done.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.533
All right, well,
it's good to see you.

23:04.567 --> 23:05.867
Yeah, you --

23:07.600 --> 23:08.767
Q: Yes! Oh, yes!

23:08.800 --> 23:10.867
Oh, my God, I'm in love.

23:13.067 --> 23:14.367
That's my Kayla.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.867
**

23:16.900 --> 23:18.933
What are you doing?
You're not getting
involved in this.

23:18.967 --> 23:20.433
Sal: Make out!

23:21.533 --> 23:23.467
Joe: I won.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.567
I went for the kiss.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.833
It's like a romance novel.

23:25.867 --> 23:27.833
It was nothing like
a romance novel.

23:31.067 --> 23:32.667
You need to stop.

23:32.700 --> 23:33.700
I'm just --

23:33.733 --> 23:35.700
You -- I'm gonna
accidentally react

23:35.733 --> 23:38.133
and knock you
in the chompers.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.067
I just went to kiss Sal,
and he pulled away.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.400
I would kiss
every other person on the Earth

23:43.433 --> 23:45.167
before you --
every last one.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.767
7 billion,
you're 7 billion and 1.
