01:12.923 --> 01:14.457
QUIT IT, BEBOP.

01:14.458 --> 01:17.294
YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE ME
DROP THIS THING.

01:17.295 --> 01:19.763
UH, I CAN'T HELP IT.

01:19.764 --> 01:22.867
LIGHTNING GIVES ME
THE WILLIES.

01:22.868 --> 01:24.770
I'LL GIVE YOU MORE
THAN THE WILLIES,

01:24.771 --> 01:27.239
IF YOU DROP
THAT MESMERIZER.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.543
NOW, GET IT TO THE TOP
OF THE TOWER.

01:29.544 --> 01:33.013
I WANT ITS BEAM
BROADCAST ACROSS
THE ENTIRE CITY.

01:33.014 --> 01:35.149
RIGHT, BOSS.

01:35.150 --> 01:37.284
THEY WILL FAIL, SHREDDER.

01:37.285 --> 01:39.521
THEY ALWAYS FAIL.

01:39.522 --> 01:40.788
BUT WHAT CHOICE
DO I HAVE?

01:40.789 --> 01:44.360
ONLY MUTANTS ARE
IMMUNE TO THE
MESMERIZER'S BEAM.

01:44.361 --> 01:48.031
HUMANS, LIKE MYSELF,
CAN'T BE NEAR IT
WHEN THEY SET IT OFF.

01:48.032 --> 01:50.901
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.104
I INVENTED IT, REMEMBER?

01:53.105 --> 01:55.406
I WASN'T EXPLAINING IT
TO YOU.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.675
I WAS EXPLAINING IT
TO THEM.

01:57.677 --> 02:00.513
ROCKSTEADY,
YOU REALLY THINK

02:00.514 --> 02:01.847
THIS THING IS
GOING TO TURN

02:01.848 --> 02:03.850
EVERYBODY
INTO ZOMBIES?

02:03.851 --> 02:05.552
LET'S FIND OUT.

02:07.756 --> 02:09.257
GOOD AFTERNOON.

02:09.258 --> 02:13.261
TODAY'S BIG STORY COMES
FROM FARAWAY ROWATANIA,

02:13.262 --> 02:16.164
WHERE THERE'S
A CRIPPLING SHORTAGE
OF RUTABAGAS.

02:16.165 --> 02:19.836
RUTABAGAS.
RUTABAGAS. RUTABAGAS.

02:19.837 --> 02:21.839
YOU COMMAND, I OBEY.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.841
YOU COMMAND, I OBEY.

02:23.842 --> 02:26.912
YOU COMMAND, I OBEY.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.081
WHAT'S GOING ON, APRIL?

02:30.082 --> 02:31.350
I DON'T KNOW, IRMA.

02:33.220 --> 02:37.023
I, I OBEY,
YOU COMMAND.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.959
I OBEY.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.929
<i>YOU COMMAND, I OBEY.</i>

02:41.930 --> 02:44.866
<i>YOU COMMAND, I OBEY.</i>

02:44.867 --> 02:47.369
WHOA!
CHECK IT OUT, DUDES.

02:47.370 --> 02:50.740
NIGHT OF THE LIVING
NEWSCASTERS.

02:50.741 --> 02:52.642
WHY DO I HAVE
A FEELING THIS ISN'T

02:52.643 --> 02:54.412
THEIR REGULARLY
SCHEDULED PROGRAM?

02:54.413 --> 03:00.052
AND I HAVE A FEELING
THAT SHREDDER AND KRANG
ARE SOMEHOW BEHIND THIS.

03:01.387 --> 03:04.490
I DON'T LIKE IT
UP HERE.

03:04.491 --> 03:06.359
CAN'T YOU HURRY
IT UP?

03:06.360 --> 03:08.328
OH, DON'T RUSH ME.

03:08.329 --> 03:11.832
PERFECTION TAKES TIME.

03:11.833 --> 03:15.069
MAMA!

03:25.350 --> 03:28.353
HEY.
A MIRACLE CATCH.

03:28.354 --> 03:30.622
YEAH, IF YOU DIDN'T
CATCH IT,

03:30.623 --> 03:32.958
WE REALLY WOULD'VE
CAUGHT IT.

03:37.365 --> 03:39.532
<i>YOU COMMAND, I OBEY.</i>

03:39.533 --> 03:42.536
<i>YOU COMMAND, I OBEY.</i>

03:42.537 --> 03:44.405
THIS IS AWFUL.

03:44.406 --> 03:48.210
BUT YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
IT'S KIND
OF A CATCHY BEAT.

03:48.211 --> 03:51.714
IT'S ROCKSTEADY
AND BEBOP.

03:51.715 --> 03:53.149
YOU WERE RIGHT,
MASTER.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.486
SHREDDER IS
DEFINITELY
BEHIND THIS.

03:55.487 --> 03:58.055
WHICH MEANS APRIL IS
IN BIG TROUBLE.

03:58.056 --> 03:59.156
LET'S GO, FELLAS.

04:01.060 --> 04:05.064
OH, THOSE
MORONIC MUTANTS.

04:05.065 --> 04:06.832
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

04:06.833 --> 04:08.000
FAILING, SHREDDER.

04:08.001 --> 04:11.905
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THEY KNOW HOW TO DO.

04:14.008 --> 04:15.776
YOU COMMAND,
WE OBEY.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.778
YOU COMMAND,
WE OBEY.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.583
OH, MY HEAD.

04:20.584 --> 04:23.085
YOU WANT
TO KNOCK IT OFF?

04:23.086 --> 04:26.022
I GOT A BAD HEADACHE.

04:26.023 --> 04:29.026
YOU COMMAND, WE OBEY.

04:29.027 --> 04:32.596
HEY, THIS BRAIN CONTROL
TAPE REALLY WORKS.

04:32.597 --> 04:36.368
LUCKY WE DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

04:36.369 --> 04:38.371
GUESS AGAIN,
DOUBLE UGLY.

04:38.372 --> 04:40.740
WHAT YOU ARE
IS HISTORY.

04:40.741 --> 04:44.912
POOR NINJAS, YOU'RE
ABOUT TO GET INJURED.

04:44.913 --> 04:46.914
HOLD IT, ROCKSTEADY.

04:46.915 --> 04:49.083
LET'S USE THE MESMERIZER
ON THEM.

04:49.084 --> 04:51.987
HEY, SLAVES, LISTEN UP.

04:51.988 --> 04:55.090
YOU COMMAND, WE OBEY.

04:55.091 --> 04:56.592
MY COMMAND IS,

04:56.593 --> 05:01.765
DON'T LET THEM TURTLES
PUT A HAND ON US.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.140
AWESOME STRATEGY,
DUDES.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.442
NO WAY WE COULD
TOUCH YOU NOW.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.445
OH, PUT US DOWN,

05:12.446 --> 05:15.014
YOU ZONKED-OUT
ZOMBIES.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.016
YEAH.

05:16.017 --> 05:17.818
DROP US.

05:20.890 --> 05:23.291
NOW, THIS IS MY
KIND OF FIGHT.

05:23.292 --> 05:26.795
FOR SURE, WE COULD
HAVE PHONED
THIS ONE IN.

05:28.932 --> 05:31.535
WHAT...WHAT HAPPENED
TO US?

05:31.536 --> 05:35.673
I HAVE THE DISTINCT
FEELING WE WERE OUT.

05:35.674 --> 05:37.041
WHERE'D WE GO?

05:37.042 --> 05:39.345
AND DID WE MEET
ANY CUTE GUYS?

05:39.346 --> 05:40.712
THE ROOF.

05:40.713 --> 05:42.248
MY NEWS STUDIO.

05:42.249 --> 05:44.618
WHO DID THIS?

05:44.619 --> 05:47.955
UM, I THINK IT'S
TIME TO SPLIT.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.257
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!
AFTER THEM, FELLAS.

05:50.258 --> 05:51.759
NOT SO FAST!

05:51.760 --> 05:53.562
YOU SLIMY
REPTILES,

05:53.563 --> 05:55.831
I'LL BET YOU'RE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS!

05:55.832 --> 05:58.301
HEY, I DENY
THAT INSINUATION.

05:58.302 --> 06:00.136
TURTLES ARE NOT SLIMY.

06:00.137 --> 06:02.305
NO TIME TO ARGUE, DONATELLO.

06:02.306 --> 06:03.674
AFTER THOSE MUTANTS!

06:06.844 --> 06:09.381
TOO LATE, GUYS.
THEY'RE GONE.

06:09.382 --> 06:13.653
THE MESMERIZER
IS THE PERFECT,
UNBEATABLE WEAPON.

06:13.654 --> 06:17.224
BUT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM,
ROCKSTEADY AND BEBOP,

06:17.225 --> 06:19.726
LEAVES MUCH
TO BE DESIRED.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.496
I AGREE WITH YOU,
SHREDDER--

06:21.497 --> 06:22.831
JUST FOR ONCE.

06:22.832 --> 06:25.834
THAT IS WHY
I HAVE DEVOTED
ALL MY EFFORTS

06:25.835 --> 06:31.475
TO ENDING
THE MUTANT PROBLEM
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

06:31.476 --> 06:33.643
I WONDER
IF THERE'S STILL TIME

06:33.644 --> 06:36.113
TO HEAR
FROM THE GOVERNOR.

06:36.114 --> 06:38.782
THIS WON'T HURT MUCH.

06:40.119 --> 06:41.953
OH, NO!

06:41.954 --> 06:45.291
I WANT A LAWYER!

06:53.702 --> 06:57.839
DON'T WORRY, APRIL,
BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY
ARE GONE.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.643
BUT WHAT IF THEY
INSTALL THAT CRAZY
MIND-CONTROL THING

07:00.644 --> 07:02.412
ON TOP
OF THE TOWER AGAIN?

07:02.413 --> 07:04.848
THEY COULD
TAKE OVER
THE ENTIRE CITY.

07:04.849 --> 07:08.586
APRIL'S RIGHT.
WE'VE GOTTA GUARD
THE CHANNEL 6 BUILDING.

07:08.587 --> 07:11.423
THE QUESTION IS HOW?
IF BURN THOMPSON SEES US,

07:11.424 --> 07:12.924
WE'RE TURTLE HASH.

07:12.925 --> 07:15.861
<i>HEY, NO PROBLEMO, AMIGOS.</i>

07:15.862 --> 07:20.199
I FOUND A TRULY
RIGHTEOUS PLACE
FOR OUR STAKEOUT.

07:23.271 --> 07:25.606
UH, GEE.
KRANG WAS RIGHT.

07:25.607 --> 07:28.343
THAT DIDN'T
HARDLY HURT AT ALL.

07:28.344 --> 07:31.045
ACTUALLY,
IT FELT KIND OF GOOD.

07:31.046 --> 07:33.883
THIS IS YOUR BRILLIANT
SOLUTION, KRANG?

07:33.884 --> 07:36.118
TWO MORE MUTANTS?

07:36.119 --> 07:40.157
NOT MERE MUTANTS.
CYBERNETIC CLONES.

07:40.158 --> 07:43.495
10 TIMES AS STRONG
AND 10 TIMES AS SMART

07:43.496 --> 07:46.965
AS ROCKSTEADY AND BEBOP
COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

07:46.966 --> 07:51.905
BEHOLD,
SUPER ROCKSTEADY
AND MIGHTY BEBOP.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.678
THE BEGINNING
OF THE END

07:56.679 --> 08:00.850
FOR THE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES!

08:10.429 --> 08:12.463
MAMA!

08:17.303 --> 08:20.306
WELL, SHREDDER,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:20.307 --> 08:22.876
OH, MOST IMPRESSIVE.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.780
THEY'LL MAKE
EXCELLENT REPLACEMENTS

08:25.781 --> 08:27.915
FOR ROCKSTEADY
AND BEBOP.

08:30.053 --> 08:32.320
APRIL TO TURTLES.
I'M IN THE CHANNEL 6 LOBBY.

08:32.321 --> 08:33.923
NO SIGN OF TROUBLE HERE.

08:33.924 --> 08:35.424
HOW DOES IT LOOK OUT THERE?

08:35.424 --> 08:37.927
EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL,
APRIL.

08:37.928 --> 08:39.796
YEAH, IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE BEBOP
AND ROCKSTEADY

08:39.797 --> 08:40.931
WILL BE BACK
TONIGHT.

08:40.932 --> 08:43.433
<i>HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF YOU NEED ME,</i>

08:43.434 --> 08:44.769
<i>I'LL BE UP IN THE STUDIO.</i>

08:44.770 --> 08:46.671
AND WE'LL BE IN
THE PIZZA PARLOR.

08:46.672 --> 08:49.675
CHECK WITH YOU LATER.

08:49.676 --> 08:52.177
OOH, I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

08:52.178 --> 08:56.483
YEAH, A COUPLE
OF FIRST-STRING
STRONG-ARMS LIKE US...

08:56.484 --> 08:57.584
BENCHED.

08:57.585 --> 08:58.819
SHREDDER,

08:58.820 --> 09:02.591
THIS TIME YOU WILL
PERSONALLY LEAD
THE SUPERMUTANTS

09:02.592 --> 09:06.629
AND SEE THAT THE MESMERIZER
IS PROPERLY INSTALLED.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.964
BRILLIANT, KRANG.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.967
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
THAT THE MESMERIZER

09:10.968 --> 09:14.137
WILL HYPNOTIZE ALL HUMANS,
INCLUDING ME?

09:14.138 --> 09:17.842
I HAVE ALREADY
SOLVED THAT PROBLEM.

09:17.843 --> 09:19.644
THIS AMULET
WILL SHIELD YOU

09:19.645 --> 09:21.213
AGAINST
THE MESMERIZER'S

09:21.214 --> 09:23.515
MIND-CONTROLLING
EFFECTS.

09:23.516 --> 09:25.652
OH, EXCELLENT.

09:25.653 --> 09:28.355
WE LEAVE FOR
THE SURFACE AT ONCE.

09:28.356 --> 09:30.391
SUPER ROCKSTEADY,
MIGHTY BEBOP,

09:30.392 --> 09:32.127
TO THE TRANSPORT
MODULE.

09:32.128 --> 09:33.928
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE TOLD THEM

09:33.929 --> 09:37.299
THAT MESMERIZER GIZMO
IS BUSTED?

09:37.300 --> 09:40.837
NO WAY. WE'RE IN
ENOUGH TROUBLE ALREADY.

09:40.838 --> 09:43.339
ALL CLEAR
OUTSIDE CHANNEL 6.

09:43.340 --> 09:46.110
ALL CLEAR
INSIDE, TOO. LOOK.

09:46.111 --> 09:49.014
<i>NOW, LET'S TAKE
A SHORT BREAK
FROM THE NEWS</i>

09:49.015 --> 09:50.849
<i>TO ADMIRE MY HAIR.</i>

09:52.351 --> 09:54.854
HERE'S YOUR,
UH, PIZZA.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.023
OH, OUTSTANDING!

09:57.024 --> 09:59.660
IS THAT THE ONE
WITH THE PICKLED HERRING

09:59.661 --> 10:01.795
AND CARAMEL FUDGE TOPPING?

10:01.796 --> 10:03.731
NATURALLY.

10:03.732 --> 10:06.668
YOU THINK MY FACE
IS ALWAYS GREEN
LIKE THIS?

10:06.669 --> 10:08.037
WHY NOT?
OURS ARE.

10:16.047 --> 10:18.549
WHEN I RULE THIS CITY,

10:18.550 --> 10:21.052
MY FIRST LAW WILL BE

10:21.053 --> 10:23.955
NO MORE FOUNTAINS
IN OFFICE BUILDINGS.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.827
YOU TWO,
GUARD THE LOBBY.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.830
REMEMBER, YOUR JOB IS
TO STOP THE TURTLES.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.199
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.335
STOP TURTLES.
STOP TURTLES.

10:34.336 --> 10:35.836
NO. STOMP TURTLES.

10:35.837 --> 10:37.672
STOMP TURTLES.

10:37.673 --> 10:39.007
STOMP TURTLES.

10:39.008 --> 10:40.475
STOMP TURTLES.

10:40.476 --> 10:44.046
YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S
AN EVEN BETTER IDEA.

10:44.047 --> 10:45.983
I'LL GO SET UP
THE MESMERIZER.

10:47.085 --> 10:49.586
UH, OH, OH,
EXCUSE ME.

10:49.587 --> 10:52.023
OH, SORRY.
UH, PARDON ME.

10:55.762 --> 10:58.297
THERE. IT'S DONE.

10:58.298 --> 10:59.699
NOW, TO TURN IT ON.

11:00.835 --> 11:03.770
OH, AT LAST I'VE WON.

11:03.771 --> 11:07.541
THE CITY SHALL FINALLY
BEND TO MY WILL.

11:11.181 --> 11:12.948
YES, YOU DID.

11:12.949 --> 11:15.252
NO, I DIDN'T.

11:15.253 --> 11:18.689
CHECK IT OUT, DUDES.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE?

11:18.690 --> 11:19.957
YES, YOU DID,

11:19.958 --> 11:22.995
AND I'M GOING
TO TELL!

11:22.996 --> 11:24.830
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO THEM?

11:24.831 --> 11:27.331
SAME THING THAT
GOT INTO HIM. LOOK.

11:29.402 --> 11:31.837
<i>¶ I'M ON TV,
AND YOU'RE NOT ¶</i>

11:34.475 --> 11:39.247
HMM. THESE
MESMERIZER READINGS
ARE VERY ODD.

11:39.248 --> 11:41.649
I WONDER IF
IT'S BEEN DAMAGED.

11:43.153 --> 11:45.487
IF IT'S NOT
WORKING PROPERLY,

11:45.488 --> 11:49.859
IT COULD PLAY
STRANGE TRICKS
ON A PERSON'S MIND.

11:50.928 --> 11:54.798
ATTENTION, SLAVES.
I AM YOUR MASTER,

11:54.799 --> 11:57.436
AND I COMMAND YOU
TO OBEY ME.

11:57.437 --> 12:01.107
I WANT MY MILK
AND COOKIES.

12:01.108 --> 12:02.242
YOU WANT WHAT?

12:02.243 --> 12:03.977
YOU HEARD ME.

12:03.978 --> 12:07.214
I GET AWFUL CRANKY
IF I DON'T HAVE
MY COOKIES.

12:08.550 --> 12:09.750
WHY YOU--

12:09.751 --> 12:11.119
TAG! YOU'RE IT!

12:12.354 --> 12:14.122
WHAT
IS GOING ON?

12:14.123 --> 12:17.126
HEY, MISTER, HELP ME
CHANGE THIS CHANNEL.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.162
I WANT
TO WATCH CARTOONS.

12:19.163 --> 12:21.398
NO.
I AM THE MASTER.

12:21.399 --> 12:25.570
YOU ARE THE SLAVE,
AND I SAY
NO CARTOONS.

12:25.571 --> 12:27.305
I WANT
TO WATCH CARTOONS!

12:27.306 --> 12:29.241
I WANT
TO WATCH CARTOONS!

12:30.710 --> 12:32.244
NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU DID,

12:32.245 --> 12:35.048
YOU GAVE ME
A BOO-BOO.

12:35.049 --> 12:36.983
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

12:36.984 --> 12:41.755
KRANG'S MESMERIZER
HAS TIME WARPED EVERYONE
BACK INTO CHILDHOOD.

12:41.756 --> 12:45.527
MONDO WEIRDNESS.
SCOPE THAT OUT.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.134
WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND HERE?

12:51.135 --> 12:53.637
I THINK THERE'S
YOUR ANSWER.

12:53.638 --> 12:55.973
BOGUS!
IT'S THAT MIND ZAPPER

12:55.974 --> 12:58.576
THAT ROCKSTEADY AND BEBOP
WERE CARRYING.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.878
I HAVE THIS
AWFUL FEELING

13:00.879 --> 13:02.415
THAT SHREDDER'S
OUTMANEUVERED US.

13:02.416 --> 13:05.785
WELL, IT'S TIME WE STARTED
SOME MANEUVERS OF OUR OWN.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.121
STOMP TURTLES!

13:07.122 --> 13:08.622
STOMP TURTLES!

13:08.623 --> 13:10.490
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

13:10.491 --> 13:12.260
WHAT ARE THESE GUYS?

13:12.261 --> 13:14.195
THEY LOOK
WEIRDLY FAMILIAR.

13:17.501 --> 13:18.934
STOMP TURTLES!

13:18.935 --> 13:20.669
STOMP TURTLES!

13:20.670 --> 13:22.738
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
THESE GUYS ARE?

13:22.739 --> 13:25.075
THEY'RE BIG TROUBLE,
THAT'S WHAT
THEY ARE.

13:25.076 --> 13:26.444
STOMP TURTLES!

13:26.445 --> 13:27.878
STOMP TURTLES!

13:33.186 --> 13:35.754
STOMP TURTLES!
STOMP TURTLES!

13:35.755 --> 13:39.358
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME MIGHTY FANCY FOOTWORK,
CAN HEAD.

13:39.359 --> 13:42.395
YEAH. FOOTWORK.

13:42.396 --> 13:44.498
THAT'S RIGHT,
GIVE HIM IDEAS.

13:46.035 --> 13:49.471
UH-OH, FELLAS.
WE GOT WORLD-CLASS
PROBLEMS.

13:52.509 --> 13:54.177
MAXIMUM WIPE OUT!

13:54.178 --> 13:55.345
NOW WHAT?

13:55.346 --> 13:57.381
DON'T WORRY. WE'LL GET
INTO THAT BUILDING.

13:57.382 --> 13:58.382
YOU'LL SEE.

13:58.383 --> 14:01.219
OH, YEAH? LIKE HOW?

14:01.220 --> 14:03.355
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
I'M A NINJA TURTLE,

14:03.356 --> 14:05.190
NOT A CARTOON WRITER.

14:09.429 --> 14:10.663
YOU'RE IT!

14:10.664 --> 14:13.768
KRANG, HAVE YOU
BEEN TINKERING
WITH THE MESMERIZER?

14:13.769 --> 14:15.736
ME? OF COURSE NOT.

14:15.737 --> 14:19.274
ONLY A COMPLETE
IDIOT WOULD DO THAT.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.112
A COMPLETE IDIOT?

14:22.113 --> 14:25.981
ROCKSTEADY!
BEBOP!

14:28.253 --> 14:30.220
ONE POTATO,
TWO POTATO,

14:30.221 --> 14:33.191
THREE POTATO,
FOUR.

14:33.192 --> 14:34.892
WHY DOES SHREDDER
WANT EVERYONE

14:34.893 --> 14:36.395
TO ACT
LIKE A CHILD?

14:36.396 --> 14:38.297
WELL, WHATEVER
SHREDDER'S SCHEME IS,

14:38.298 --> 14:39.298
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HIM.

14:40.300 --> 14:43.370
HEY, WHAT'S
GOING DOWN?

14:43.371 --> 14:45.472
I THINK WE ARE.

14:45.473 --> 14:46.974
STOMP TURTLES!

14:46.975 --> 14:48.576
STOMP TURTLES!

14:48.577 --> 14:52.414
OH! MY SUCTION CUPS.
THEY'RE PULLING LOOSE.

14:52.415 --> 14:55.418
I CAN'T HOLD ON
MUCH LONGER.

14:55.419 --> 14:58.254
IS THIS EVER SUSPENSEFUL
OR WHAT?

15:03.228 --> 15:06.898
SO MUCH FOR THAT IDEA.

15:06.899 --> 15:11.571
HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU IMBECILES
GOING TO FAIL ME?

15:11.572 --> 15:14.341
OOH, LOTS
MORE TIMES, BOSS.

15:14.342 --> 15:17.478
YEAH, WE AIN'T
THE LEAST BIT TIRED.

15:17.479 --> 15:19.613
SHUT UP AND LISTEN.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.716
I WILL GIVE YOU
ONE LAST CHANCE

15:21.717 --> 15:23.184
TO REDEEM YOURSELVES.

15:23.185 --> 15:25.388
NOW, GO TO THE RED
DRAWER IN THAT BLUE
DESK,

15:25.389 --> 15:27.423
AND BRING ME
THE YELLOW
COMPUTER DISK.

15:27.424 --> 15:29.025
OH, LET'S SEE.

15:29.026 --> 15:30.760
WE GOTTA TAKE
THE BLUE DISK

15:30.761 --> 15:33.531
OUT OF THE YELLOW DRAWER
IN THE RED DESK.

15:33.532 --> 15:36.967
OR WAS IT
YELLOW DISK OUT
OF THE RED DESK?

15:36.968 --> 15:39.871
OR THE BLUE DISK
OUT OF THE BLUE DESK?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.743
STOP WASTING
VALUABLE TIME!

15:43.744 --> 15:46.212
YOU MUST GET
THAT SCHEMATIC DISK

15:46.213 --> 15:49.150
UP TO SHREDDER
AND REPAIR
THE MESMERIZER.

15:49.151 --> 15:53.288
AW, HECK.
ONE COLOR'S
AS GOOD AS ANOTHER.

15:55.491 --> 15:57.927
FELLAS, WHAT WE NEED
IS A PLAN.

15:57.928 --> 16:00.863
RIGHT. WE'VE
GOT TO GET PAST
THOSE SUPER ROBOTS.

16:00.864 --> 16:02.832
MAYBE WE COULD
SHORT CIRCUIT THEM.

16:02.833 --> 16:06.003
MONDO NOTION.
BUT HOW?

16:06.004 --> 16:07.438
HEY, I JUST
THINK THEM UP.

16:07.439 --> 16:08.873
A GUY CAN'T DO
EVERYTHING.

16:14.548 --> 16:15.582
GARBAGE.

16:15.583 --> 16:19.219
OOH, AND I
TOOK A BATH
JUST LAST MONTH.

16:19.220 --> 16:22.190
IT'S BEBOP
AND ROCKSTEADY.

16:22.191 --> 16:23.391
THEY'RE
HEADED FOR
CHANNEL 6.

16:23.392 --> 16:26.795
UNLESS WE CUT THEM OFF
AT THE PASS.

16:28.731 --> 16:32.435
OH, HEY. THIS DOOR
IS S-STUCK.

16:32.436 --> 16:34.004
AND IT WON'T UNSTICK

16:34.005 --> 16:36.507
UNTIL YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

16:36.508 --> 16:39.244
DO WE LOOK
STUPID OR SOMETHING?

16:39.245 --> 16:41.913
YEAH. WE'LL NEVER
SPILL THE BEANS

16:41.914 --> 16:44.717
ABOUT SHREDDER
NEEDING THIS DISK.

16:44.718 --> 16:47.086
YEAH. NOW,
LET US OUT
OF HERE.

16:47.087 --> 16:50.157
WHY NOT? ONE BIG JERK
DESERVES ANOTHER.

16:54.297 --> 16:55.897
WHAT'S THIS THING?

16:55.898 --> 16:59.135
THIS JUST MIGHT
BE THE ANSWER
TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS.

17:01.071 --> 17:03.006
STOMP DUMMIES!

17:03.007 --> 17:04.040
STOMP DUMMIES!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.978
UH-OH. I THINK
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

17:06.979 --> 17:09.380
STOP THAT!

17:09.381 --> 17:10.881
YOU TWO SUPER MUTANTS

17:10.882 --> 17:13.285
SHOULD BE GUARDING
AGAINST THE TURTLES.

17:13.286 --> 17:16.221
YEAH. STOMP TURTLES.
YEAH. STOMP TURTLES.

17:16.222 --> 17:19.626
AND YOU TWO STUPID
MUTANTS COME WITH ME.

17:19.627 --> 17:21.194
YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

17:24.266 --> 17:25.767
CLIMB TO THE TOP
OF THE TOWER

17:25.768 --> 17:28.203
AND REPAIR
THE MESMERIZER
AT ONCE.

17:29.571 --> 17:32.174
UH, S-S-SURE, BOSS.

17:32.175 --> 17:33.376
WELL, DONATELLO,

17:33.377 --> 17:35.278
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT
THAT DISK IS FOR?

17:35.279 --> 17:37.381
I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS.

17:37.382 --> 17:39.616
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT
IT DOESN'T CONTAIN

17:39.617 --> 17:41.852
THE SCHEMATICS
FOR THE MESMERIZER.

17:41.853 --> 17:45.291
BUT IT DOES CONTAIN
THE SCHEMATICS FOR
THE SUPER MUTANTS.

17:45.292 --> 17:46.492
WHICH MEANS?

17:46.493 --> 17:49.195
WE CAN USE IT TO
COUNTERPROGRAM THEM.

17:49.196 --> 17:52.432
GIVE ME THE DISK,
SO WE CAN GET STARTED.

17:52.433 --> 17:55.570
UH-OH. IT AIN'T HERE.

17:55.571 --> 17:57.471
I MUST HAVE
DROPPED IT?

17:57.472 --> 18:00.709
YOU BIG TWERP,
NOW WE'RE GOING
TO GET IT GOOD.

18:00.710 --> 18:03.211
YOU BUMBLING
IGNORAMUSES!

18:03.212 --> 18:04.847
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP THERE?

18:04.848 --> 18:08.685
HEY, BOSS!
IT'S CHANGING COLORS!

18:08.686 --> 18:12.890
HMM. I WONDER WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

18:23.371 --> 18:25.505
UH, SOMETHING
WRONG, BOSS?

18:25.506 --> 18:27.275
WRONG?

18:27.276 --> 18:29.843
I'LL SHOW YOU WRONG!

18:35.818 --> 18:38.121
SMELL TURTLES.

18:38.122 --> 18:40.457
SEE TURTLES.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.793
RIGHT THIS WAY, BIG GUYS.

18:42.794 --> 18:45.696
STOMP TURTLES!
STOMP TURTLES!

18:45.697 --> 18:47.265
HERE GOES!

18:49.001 --> 18:50.202
IT'S WORKING!

18:50.203 --> 18:53.907
ALL RIGHT! NOW
TO REPROGRAM THEM.

18:53.908 --> 18:57.210
HEY, IT'S CHANGING
COLORS AGAIN.

18:57.211 --> 19:00.549
WOOF WOOF!
RUFF RUFF!
ARF ARF!

19:10.728 --> 19:12.796
THIS IS ABSURD!

19:19.406 --> 19:22.074
HUH?
MY SUPER MUTANTS?

19:22.075 --> 19:25.111
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP THIS INSTANT!

19:25.112 --> 19:26.646
YOU'RE NOT PROGRAMMED
TO LEAD.

19:26.647 --> 19:28.047
THEY ARE NOW.

19:28.048 --> 19:30.618
<i>ADIOS, MESMERIZER.</i>

19:39.363 --> 19:42.064
THE MESMERIZER!
HEY, WHERE'D IT GO?

19:42.065 --> 19:46.036
IT'S WHERE
IT BELONGS--
IN MY POSSESSION.

19:46.037 --> 19:49.274
HOO HOO! THAT'S
TELLING THEM, BOSS.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.109
NOW WHAT?

19:51.110 --> 19:53.012
THAT AMULET
SHREDDER'S WEARING--

19:53.013 --> 19:56.683
IT MUST BE WHAT
PROTECTS HIM FROM
THE MESMERIZER'S RAYS.

19:56.684 --> 19:58.084
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?

19:58.085 --> 19:59.085
THIS!

20:01.323 --> 20:02.490
WHAT?

20:02.491 --> 20:05.826
COME BACK
WITH MY AMULET!

20:08.364 --> 20:10.466
WHAT'S COME OVER
THE BOSS?

20:10.467 --> 20:12.202
I THINK IT'S FUR.

20:13.470 --> 20:15.573
WAIT, BOSS.
COME BACK.

20:15.574 --> 20:18.242
I'LL GIVE YOU
A BANANA!

20:31.660 --> 20:33.894
IT'S--
IT'S HORRIBLE!

20:33.895 --> 20:35.864
OH, THAT'S FOR SURE!

20:35.865 --> 20:39.268
ALL THAT PIZZA
TOTALLY TRASHED!

20:44.308 --> 20:46.009
YOU OK,
ROCKSTEADY?

20:46.010 --> 20:49.146
YEAH. THIS
BROKE MY FALL.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.486
WH--WHAT HAPPENED?

20:54.487 --> 20:56.121
I FEEL SO STRANGE.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.825
YEAH. ME, TOO.

20:58.826 --> 21:01.227
SUDDENLY, I DON'T MIND
WORKING FOR PEANUTS.

21:01.228 --> 21:03.431
HOW DID I GET UP HERE?

21:03.432 --> 21:05.366
WITH A DOUBLE BACK FLIP.

21:05.367 --> 21:08.470
FOLLOWED BY
A TRIPLE SOMERSAULT.

21:10.373 --> 21:12.708
MR. THOMPSON,
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

21:12.709 --> 21:17.347
FINE. I'M JUST
A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED.

21:17.348 --> 21:19.283
HEY, LADIES, THANKS
FOR THE PIZZA.

21:19.284 --> 21:23.121
REALLY. THIS
MARSHMALLOW AND
ASPARAGUS TOPPING

21:23.122 --> 21:25.123
IS TRULY AWESOME.

21:25.124 --> 21:28.561
OH, WELL, IT'S THE LEAST
WE CAN DO FOR YOU GUYS.

21:28.562 --> 21:31.264
YEAH. THE WAY
THAT SHREDDER CREEP

21:31.265 --> 21:34.067
TRIED TO MAKE MONKEYS
OUT OF US!

THEN AGAIN,
FOR SOME PEOPLE,

IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT!
