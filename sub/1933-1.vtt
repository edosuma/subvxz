01:51.708 --> 01:55.583
Mom! Jethro's eating my underwear!

01:59.208 --> 02:01.917
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy. Jethro.

02:02.083 --> 02:04.875
Mom, before she starts,
there isn't a shred of evidence

02:04.958 --> 02:08.417
- to support her allegations.
- Gillian, your son is a psycho.

02:08.500 --> 02:13.250
- He booby-trapped my hair dryer.
- Nice hypothesis, but you can't prove it.

02:13.458 --> 02:18.083
- Yeah, but I can hurt you.
- Mom! Mom! She needs to be medicated.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.542
- Come on, Jethro.
- Come here.

02:21.667 --> 02:24.667
I hate this family. Come here.

02:25.792 --> 02:28.250
Jethro, you're getting a time out.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.833
Come on, guys. Backpack.

02:48.750 --> 02:52.750
- What? It's in style.
- It's inappropriate. Go put on some jeans.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.167
And spit out the gum.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.750
So, what color do you want to wear today?

03:00.958 --> 03:04.375
Red? Blue? Purple?

03:04.667 --> 03:06.583
Pink, Momma, pink.

03:07.208 --> 03:10.208
- Farren.
- What? You said jeans.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.250
I meant in your size.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.417
Come on, guys. Come on.
We don't want to be late. There you go.

03:23.792 --> 03:25.458
Come on, sweetie.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.750
- No!
- Get out!

03:33.500 --> 03:34.917
No fighting.

03:47.292 --> 03:48.583
Allow me.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.042
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:50.125 --> 03:53.042
- Are we still on for dinner?
- I'll be there.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.625
We have an audience.

03:55.958 --> 03:59.542
- Yuck. I'm going to vomit.
- He is such a loser.

03:59.625 --> 04:01.583
I like Bob. He's nice.

04:01.667 --> 04:04.750
He's a boring pen importer.
He does the same routine every day.

04:04.833 --> 04:07.708
- He's like a robot.
- That's 'cause he is a robot.

04:07.792 --> 04:12.708
A cyborg, sent from the future,
to destroy humanity. Starting with us.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.375
Well, it's been three months.
Happy anniversary.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.042
What is it?

04:31.458 --> 04:33.917
I have to tell you about my job.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.625
This might shock you,

04:38.250 --> 04:42.542
but you should know everything
before this relationship goes further.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.250
- Don't, Bob.
- What?

04:47.292 --> 04:49.750
I'm very happy when I'm with you.

04:49.917 --> 04:52.708
No one has ever made me laugh like you do,

04:53.083 --> 04:55.875
and if I were a single woman,
I could see a real future for us.

04:55.958 --> 04:57.958
But I'm a package deal.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.458
What do you mean?

05:01.292 --> 05:05.292
My kids are my priority and...
How can I put this gently?

05:05.917 --> 05:08.458
- They hate me.
- Yeah.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.875
- I can make them like me.
- See?

05:11.958 --> 05:15.375
You can't make kids like you,
not mine or anyone's.

05:17.667 --> 05:20.375
My kids have been through a lot, and...

05:20.458 --> 05:24.750
I don't think we should take the next step
until they warm up to you.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.583
Doesn't your happiness count?

05:29.792 --> 05:31.167
Excuse me.

05:35.083 --> 05:38.292
Sorry, I gotta go. Emergency at work.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.500
- No ink?
- It's much bigger.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.250
Sorry, really.
I will explain everything tomorrow.

05:46.583 --> 05:48.750
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.667
- What took you so long to get here?
- Six minutes.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.417
- You stop for a latte?
- I get it. You're...

06:13.500 --> 06:16.792
- What's the expression? Chopping my bust.
- Close enough.

06:16.875 --> 06:20.125
Poldark and a couple other Russkys
just went in the refinery.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.042
Then I was right. He's planning something.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.500
Maybe they just want to fill up
their gas tanks for free.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.833
- I couldn't blame them.
- No, that man's so crooked,

06:28.917 --> 06:31.333
he could eat nails and poop corkscrews.

06:31.417 --> 06:33.000
You're the world's foremost authority
on Poldark.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.417
What do you think he's up to?

06:34.500 --> 06:37.083
If his mission is to sabotage
the world's oil reserves,

06:37.167 --> 06:40.250
why would he care about
some two-bit refinery like this one?

06:40.750 --> 06:43.583
I'll make sure you get a chance to ask him.

06:58.333 --> 07:01.250
How the heck are you going to get in there?
A jet pack?

07:01.583 --> 07:03.250
It's in the shop.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.500
Wait for my signal.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.167
Yuri.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.375
- What's this?
- C-4.

07:34.625 --> 07:38.792
When we are done here, I want you
to blow this place to smithereens.

08:15.208 --> 08:19.417
Hurry up. I don't have all day.
There is no overtime here.

08:42.042 --> 08:43.750
Bob Ho.

08:57.333 --> 09:00.042
I would love to chat, but I gotta go.

09:47.583 --> 09:50.042
- Up there. Go, go, go, go.
- Move it.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.125
- Move.
- Hold it. Stay where you are.

09:52.250 --> 09:55.750
That was fun. A good aerobic workout.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.000
We should do this again sometime.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.917
Okay, Poldark, let's go.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.833
We have suspect in custody.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.708
Did you see the look
on Poldark's face, man?

10:13.167 --> 10:15.625
Brilliant work, Bob. Unbelievable.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.625
I really hate to see you go home.
You're the best agent I've ever had.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.250
Hey, you know I'm standing right here.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.208
Maybe I can get your government
to loan you to me just a little bit longer.

10:24.292 --> 10:28.167
No. This was my last assignment.
I'm retiring.

10:28.792 --> 10:34.250
- Don't tell me because of Gillian.
- I want a normal life. I want to get married.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.542
Oh, heck, man. Don't get married.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.833
Just find some woman
that you're going to hate in five years

10:38.917 --> 10:40.917
and give her your house.

10:41.958 --> 10:45.667
Keep the watch.
A memento, compliments of the CIA.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.583
So, Gillian? Is that the woman
that lives next door to your cover house?

10:49.667 --> 10:53.583
- Yeah, they've been stepping out.
- I could never give up this life for a woman.

10:53.708 --> 10:54.833
We're spies, man.

10:54.917 --> 10:57.542
Every little boy wants to be a spy.
It's the life.

10:57.625 --> 11:00.292
All the hours you spend
sitting alone in a little room like this,

11:00.375 --> 11:02.667
eating cold take-out food
in the back of a surveillance van,

11:02.750 --> 11:04.333
getting shot at all the time,

11:04.417 --> 11:07.000
learning how to pee in a bottle
in a moving vehicle.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.292
- You're doing the right thing.
- Only problem is that her kids hate me.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.750
You the man.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.417
Really gonna miss you, Ho.
Good luck with those kids.

11:17.500 --> 11:21.083
I've brought down dictators.
How tough can three kids be?

11:23.125 --> 11:24.625
- Come on, Ringo, come on.
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

11:24.708 --> 11:27.667
- Ringo!
- Don't worry. Come on. Come on.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.833
- Come on. Right here.
- Come on, Ringo.

11:29.917 --> 11:31.417
- Come on, Ringo.
- Ringo.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.750
Hi, kids.

11:37.917 --> 11:40.708
I'm sorry about running out last night.

11:40.958 --> 11:44.000
- It's all right. It's your job.
- No, it was rude.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.708
I promise it will never happen again.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.667
Mom, what about Ringo?

11:51.042 --> 11:55.208
We've tried everything, sweetheart.
He'll come down when he's ready.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.667
You want to see
what I've been working on?

11:57.750 --> 11:59.083
Sure.

12:00.750 --> 12:05.417
Ringo, Ringo! Come on, kitty.
It's not that far.

12:05.708 --> 12:08.250
Please, please, please, Ringo.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.083
There you go.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.792
- So, what do you think?
- Well...

12:37.458 --> 12:38.917
It's a work-in-progress.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.333
Sadly, I didn't have any time
to work on it today.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.750
Cat was on the roof,
satellite's broken again.

12:43.833 --> 12:47.042
I spent two hours on hold
trying to get a repairman out here,

12:47.125 --> 12:50.292
and I can't stop thinking about last night.

12:50.917 --> 12:53.750
So, are we okay?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.125
I understand.

12:57.208 --> 13:00.417
If a man marries you,
he marries all four of you.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.458
Don't forget the pig, the cat and the turtle.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.917
So, do you really like it?

13:09.542 --> 13:11.458
It frightens me.

13:12.083 --> 13:16.083
Sometimes I think I found
the last honest man left in the world.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.583
I brought you all cookies.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.375
- Yes?
- Is it true? You're going to marry Bob?

13:34.500 --> 13:37.583
- What? Whoa! Calm down.
- You can't do this, Gillian.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.208
You're, like, so far above him.

13:39.292 --> 13:42.250
What she means is he's boring. He's a geek.

13:42.333 --> 13:45.333
He's a very nice man
who treats me very well.

13:45.500 --> 13:49.250
- He's a pen importer.
- He's a cyborg.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.208
You all don't know him like I do.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.375
He's very passionate about the world
and about my art.

13:56.458 --> 13:59.917
He likes to talk about history,
science and politics.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.792
I see what you mean about
him not being boring.

14:06.458 --> 14:09.958
What you all call boring, I call dependable.

14:10.167 --> 14:13.417
For once, I'd like a man who goes to work
every day at the same time,

14:13.583 --> 14:15.625
and who comes home every single night.

14:15.750 --> 14:20.333
A man who doesn't lie, or cheat,
or leave his family the first time some...

14:30.917 --> 14:32.917
My happiness counts, too.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.375
I hate it when old people have feelings.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.250
We gotta deep-six Bob.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.167
- What's the story here?
- They hit Poldark's prison transport caravan

14:59.250 --> 15:02.083
- at the edge of town.
- Tell me he didn't get away.

15:02.417 --> 15:05.167
He's as gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.667
I'm telling you,
this whole thing was a setup.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.500
They knew he was coming.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.042
Are you saying
there's a mole in the agency?

15:12.125 --> 15:14.958
I'm not saying anything except he got away.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.750
Welcome back.

15:47.042 --> 15:51.292
Tatiana,
you can't imagine what it's like in there.

15:51.500 --> 15:56.292
The oppressive darkness and the torture
of empty days stretching for years.

15:56.875 --> 16:00.417
- Prison is hell.
- You were in there for four hours.

16:01.208 --> 16:03.125
Enough tearful reunion.

16:05.708 --> 16:09.167
I need a new batch of the formula
as soon as possible.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.917
We'll run another test in two days.

16:14.667 --> 16:18.500
I need a change of clothes.
Something current and fashionable.

16:18.875 --> 16:22.125
And something to eat
that does not come with a toy.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.833
The Sea Hag's made Olive into a zombie.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.500
Honey, we're getting ready
to carve pumpkins downstairs.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.458
- You want to join us?
- Absolutely!

17:28.541 --> 17:31.750
'Cause I'm a loser and I have no life.

17:31.875 --> 17:35.250
Did I mention we're going
to toast the pumpkin seeds?

17:35.917 --> 17:38.958
Come on. I want you to join the family.

17:39.042 --> 17:40.917
And I want some privacy.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.167
- Don't get fresh with me.
- I'll use whatever tone of voice

17:43.250 --> 17:46.125
- I want to use with you.
- Farren, I want you downstairs...

17:46.208 --> 17:47.792
No, I'm not going to come downstairs
right now. Get out.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.000
Farren, this is my house.
You will listen to me.

17:50.083 --> 17:53.292
You don't own me. Get out.
I said, get out, Gillian. Get out!

17:53.375 --> 17:54.958
Downstairs in five minutes.

17:55.042 --> 17:58.208
I hate this house. I hate this family. Get out!

18:05.542 --> 18:06.917
Me spinach!

18:10.625 --> 18:13.250
No, she won't hear me. I'm on the roof.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.875
It's like the only place
I can get any privacy in this loony bin.

18:18.542 --> 18:21.042
I can't let Gillian marry this guy.

18:21.875 --> 18:25.167
No, it's not that.
I mean, you're right, he is a total drone,

18:25.250 --> 18:27.333
but that's not the issue.

18:27.417 --> 18:29.375
What's going to happen
when my dad comes back?

18:30.708 --> 18:33.292
He won't just leave me here alone.
He'll be back.

18:33.375 --> 18:37.500
And if she's married, what happens then?
I don't know.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.250
Mom, lan's feeding Jethro bacon.

18:49.458 --> 18:52.292
- Okay, that's just wrong.
- Why is it wrong?

19:07.667 --> 19:11.458
- Ho, Bob Ho.
- Hey. So, how's it going with those kids?

19:11.708 --> 19:13.708
I'm taking Gillian and the children
on a picnic.

19:13.792 --> 19:15.750
I'm going to force those kids to like me.

19:15.833 --> 19:20.083
Force them? You know, you might as well
try scratching your ear with your elbow.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.667
Guess what? Poldark escaped.

19:27.375 --> 19:31.750
- No longer my problem.
- Yeah, I know, but we recovered a file.

19:31.917 --> 19:34.542
It seems to be an entry portal to a website.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.708
We can't crack it.
I thought maybe you could take a look at it.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.708
Hey, if you can figure it out, great.
If you can't, no harm, no foul.

19:43.292 --> 19:46.500
As a favor to you.
Send it to my home computer.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.125
Already did.

19:48.708 --> 19:53.750
While I'm thinking about it, they suspect
there may be a mole at the agency.

19:54.042 --> 19:56.208
- They suspect me?
- No.

19:56.292 --> 20:00.042
You know Glaze thinks
you're the sharpest barb on the wire.

20:00.292 --> 20:02.333
I have no idea what that means.

20:02.958 --> 20:05.000
Hey, listen, man, have fun on your picnic.

20:05.083 --> 20:08.667
Just shoot me back
when you check out that file. Thanks.

20:25.667 --> 20:29.125
Puzzle encryption.
Let's see what you've got.

20:44.417 --> 20:47.208
- Is it noon already?
- No. I have bad news.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.083
- My father is in the hospital.
- That's terrible.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.708
He plays senior softball
and he slid into third.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.792
- Now he's having his hip replaced.
- That's terrible.

20:58.875 --> 21:02.792
I have to leave the kids
and fly to Denver to take care of Dad.

21:03.708 --> 21:06.542
- That's great.
- What are you talking about?

21:06.708 --> 21:08.000
Let me watch the kids.

21:08.083 --> 21:11.333
It would give us a chance
to get to know each other.

21:11.417 --> 21:15.917
No, Bob. You? Them? I don't know.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.417
My aunt's flying in from San Antonio.
She's very good with the kids.

21:19.500 --> 21:23.375
- She was in the military.
- Gillian, this could be just what we need.

21:23.542 --> 21:25.875
You really think you can handle
that kind of pressure?

21:26.208 --> 21:29.083
The driving, the schoolwork,
and then there's Halloween.

21:29.208 --> 21:31.708
Getting their costumes,
finishing decorating the house?

21:31.792 --> 21:34.875
No problem. Halloween is my favorite.

21:35.042 --> 21:38.375
You have nothing to worry about.
They will be perfectly safe with me.

21:39.875 --> 21:42.208
It's not them I'm worried about.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.417
- You can't be serious.
- Isn't there any other option?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.542
Foster care? Juvenile hall?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.875
Okay. You'll be fine.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.333
Love you guys.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.833
- I'm going to miss you.
- Yeah, as proven by this total abandonment.

22:00.917 --> 22:04.500
You'll survive. I'll buy you something
from the hospital gift shop.

22:04.583 --> 22:06.167
- Bye.
- Bye. Love you.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.375
- See you later.
- Bye.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.000
So, is this exciting, or what?

22:18.958 --> 22:23.500
Well, I'll just pack a few things,
and we'll go to your house, okay?

22:36.083 --> 22:38.708
A Flowbee. I knew he cut his own hair.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.250
Nothing telling in his DVD collection.

22:41.333 --> 22:44.125
Standard action movies,
mainstream comedies,

22:44.208 --> 22:47.083
no sci-fi, and nothing above PG-13.

22:49.083 --> 22:51.625
Hey, his computer. Let's check it out.

22:51.708 --> 22:54.250
Good idea.
There's got to be some dirt on there.

22:58.292 --> 23:00.583
Fashion Armageddon.

23:00.667 --> 23:04.042
I haven't forgotten, Colton.
I will look at the file.

23:04.125 --> 23:07.625
But this is important. What is Halloween?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.250
Farren, do you realize what this is?

23:13.833 --> 23:17.167
It's got you all worked up.
Let me guess, a Klingon dictionary?

23:17.250 --> 23:20.750
You have me confused
with an entirely different class of geek.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.292
Stockholm GBH.

23:22.375 --> 23:25.792
Grievous Bodily Harm, live in Stockholm.

23:25.958 --> 23:29.208
This is one of the rarest bootleg concerts
in the world.

23:29.292 --> 23:32.875
- Why does Bob have it?
- Who cares? I'm gonna download it.

23:34.917 --> 23:37.708
This is my ticket to Coolsville.

23:46.833 --> 23:49.250
This is what you bring me to wear?

23:50.708 --> 23:52.583
You said you wanted current.

23:52.667 --> 23:55.167
I look like the Fresh Prince of Belarus.

23:55.250 --> 23:58.208
Send someone out
to get me something elegant.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.792
What is this program you found?

24:01.208 --> 24:02.958
I went on to download the formula

24:03.042 --> 24:06.208
and found the site being accessed
by a third party.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.792
If the United States or China
has the formula,

24:08.875 --> 24:10.292
they can develop an antibody for it.

24:10.375 --> 24:12.792
I'm tracing the ISP,
but it's heavily encrypted.

24:12.875 --> 24:15.125
It will take me a while to track it down.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.875
Find whoever downloaded my formula.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.917
- Retrieve it.
- And?

24:21.792 --> 24:24.458
- Kill them.
- Thank you.

24:32.542 --> 24:34.625
- What's up with you?
- I'm gonna kill you.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.708
What? I'm gonna kill you.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.708
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
She's hurting me!

24:39.792 --> 24:41.792
Hey, hey, hey.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.500
Hey, stop!

24:45.000 --> 24:47.958
- What's going on here?
- She threw a stink bomb in my room.

24:48.042 --> 24:49.458
What? That's so not true.

24:49.542 --> 24:53.542
So what, you're saying I threw
a stink bomb in my own room

24:53.708 --> 24:57.375
just to get you in trouble? Sad. So sad.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.125
Hey, hey, hey.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.458
Farren, I'm very disappointed in you.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.750
You two should be in bed by now.

25:05.833 --> 25:09.458
Well, if we finish our homework in time,
Gillian lets us stay up till midnight.

25:11.542 --> 25:15.500
She also likes us to watch Adult Swim.
It's kind of a tradition.

25:16.542 --> 25:19.208
I didn't really think this one through.

25:28.458 --> 25:32.125
Nora, let's get ready for bed.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.542
I don't want to go to bed.

25:39.542 --> 25:42.000
Only my mommy can dress me.

25:42.542 --> 25:43.750
Nora.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.500
Here I come.

25:49.667 --> 25:53.625
Hey! Come back. I'll get you.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.333
Come back!

25:59.833 --> 26:01.875
I got you. No, come back!

26:06.583 --> 26:07.708
Nora.

26:08.708 --> 26:10.750
Come on. Nora.

26:12.083 --> 26:13.958
- Only my mommy can dress me.
- Come on, Nora.

26:14.042 --> 26:16.292
Only my mommy can dress me!

26:16.875 --> 26:19.417
Only mommy can dress me!

26:20.708 --> 26:21.958
You.

26:28.375 --> 26:31.333
Can your mommy do that? Sleep.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.583
Get out!

27:06.500 --> 27:10.125
- Hello?
- You're alive. That's a good sign.

27:10.583 --> 27:14.625
- How are the kids?
- We had a great night. Easy as pie.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.250
Really? You're with my kids, right?

27:19.833 --> 27:22.458
Bob, the other night at dinner,

27:22.542 --> 27:26.458
you were gonna say something
about your job, and I cut you off.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.250
You want to tell me now?

27:30.542 --> 27:32.875
It can wait until you get back.

27:34.542 --> 27:39.417
- I really think this was a good idea.
- I'm sure the worst is behind us.

27:58.833 --> 28:00.333
Just a second.

28:21.292 --> 28:22.667
I got it.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.042
Fire!

28:32.542 --> 28:34.042
Big mistake.

28:39.542 --> 28:42.542
Everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.167
- Shotgun.
- It's not your day.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.750
You sure your mother
lets you go to school like that?

28:53.833 --> 28:55.083
Dun, Bob.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.375
"Dun, Bob."

29:09.417 --> 29:12.458
- Bye.
- Well, you guys have a nice day.

29:15.542 --> 29:18.292
- Hi.
- That is so cute.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.833
So what do you do all day?

29:24.458 --> 29:26.125
Nothing. I'm four.

29:33.417 --> 29:35.292
- You're full of it.
- Yeah, full of it.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.917
I'm telling you, I downloaded it yesterday.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.333
Really? 'Cause if you really had,
that'd be pretty cool.

29:40.417 --> 29:43.125
- Yeah, pretty cool.
- Let's hear it then.

29:48.958 --> 29:51.500
You trying to pop our ears?
That's nothing but a bunch of static.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.083
- I don't get it.
- I get it.

29:53.167 --> 29:56.167
You're a pathetic little nerd and a liar.
Let's get him.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.292
Wedgie!

29:59.375 --> 30:02.333
Put me down! Put me down!
Put me down! Put me down!

30:02.417 --> 30:04.333
Okay, you asked for it.

30:07.875 --> 30:11.083
No! You guys are gonna hear from me
and my lawyer.

30:11.458 --> 30:15.042
You'll pay for this,
each and every one of you.

30:22.542 --> 30:25.042
So, tell me more about Halloween.

30:26.042 --> 30:28.792
It's the best. You get candy.

30:29.375 --> 30:33.875
Everyone pretends to be someone else,
and nobody knows who you really are.

30:34.208 --> 30:37.042
Sounds familiar. Nora...

30:38.417 --> 30:42.125
So, what do you want to be?
A Frankenstein? A zombie?

30:43.250 --> 30:45.917
Sweetie, do you want to be a princess?

30:47.458 --> 30:48.667
Yes.

30:54.125 --> 30:56.167
Okay, princess.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.083
Nora?

31:05.667 --> 31:10.167
Not fairy. Princess. Princess.

31:11.417 --> 31:12.708
Princess.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.042
Pink.

31:20.208 --> 31:21.292
Pink.

31:40.458 --> 31:43.375
- Princess.
- It's too big.

31:44.375 --> 31:47.542
Too big? Okay.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.750
Nora? Nora.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.625
Nora.

32:13.208 --> 32:14.333
Nora.

32:18.542 --> 32:19.833
Nora.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.250
Nora!

32:30.125 --> 32:33.542
Nora. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.333
Nora!

33:01.792 --> 33:04.792
Nora. Please don't wander off again.

33:05.708 --> 33:07.208
I'm sorry, Bob.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.458
Let's go pay for your costume.

33:15.542 --> 33:16.958
Yo, it's Ho.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.500
Just hold him till I get there.

33:28.375 --> 33:32.708
Can I just say before we begin that
only in the current distressed condition

33:32.792 --> 33:35.167
of the American public school system

33:35.250 --> 33:39.083
could I be deposited headfirst
into a garbage can,

33:39.167 --> 33:43.042
and yet I'm the one who winds up
receiving disciplinary action?

33:44.542 --> 33:46.042
Who exactly are you?

33:47.292 --> 33:49.042
I'm his mother's...

33:50.667 --> 33:51.958
- Neighbor.
- Neighbor.

33:52.042 --> 33:54.792
I'm watching them for a few days.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.958
Well, this is not the first time
lan has been in trouble.

33:58.042 --> 33:59.958
He gets in fights. He lies.

34:00.042 --> 34:01.000
Hey, I don't lie.

34:01.083 --> 34:05.417
You told everyone you invited
Selena Gomez to the spring dance.

34:05.708 --> 34:07.625
Her appearance fee was an obstacle.

34:07.708 --> 34:10.292
You said you spent New Year's Eve
at the Playboy Mansion.

34:10.375 --> 34:13.708
Hey, pay-per-view high-def.
I felt like I was there.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.583
I'm telling you, lying is a dangerous game.

34:22.792 --> 34:25.292
Bob, you sell pens. What do you...

34:25.375 --> 34:27.708
- Oh, no. That's them.
- Who?

34:27.792 --> 34:30.708
The future felons who
put me in the trash can.

34:31.792 --> 34:34.250
Hey, geek-boy,
we got detention because of you.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.250
- Yeah, because of you.
- You're gonna pay for that.

34:37.333 --> 34:40.750
- Gentlemen, we don't want trouble.
- Who's this? Your mom?

34:40.917 --> 34:46.000
You wish. He's my bodyguard.
I hired him. You better watch out.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.208
- That true?
- No. He's joking.

34:48.875 --> 34:51.792
- I'm their babysitter.
- What are you gonna do?

34:52.208 --> 34:55.208
Ask you politely to allow us to pass.

35:07.375 --> 35:10.708
How humiliating.
Why didn't you do something?

35:11.417 --> 35:14.250
Why did you tell them
I was your bodyguard?

35:14.875 --> 35:18.083
You're right.
I guess it was too big a stretch.

35:31.042 --> 35:33.875
Hey. How you doing? I'm lan.

35:34.167 --> 35:37.792
If I told you, you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

35:40.875 --> 35:45.042
- At least you're not shy.
- I wanted to talk to her in the worst way.

35:46.292 --> 35:48.083
Mission accomplished.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.625
Come here.

35:54.708 --> 35:56.458
You look so pretty.

35:59.417 --> 36:02.125
Farren, I didn't know you did gymnastics.

36:02.208 --> 36:05.042
Why would you?
You don't know anything about me.

36:05.208 --> 36:09.458
You come over to hang out with Gillian,
and you never even talk to us.

36:10.125 --> 36:11.792
Come on, let's go.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.458
The woman's got a point.

36:22.125 --> 36:27.042
I don't know who you are sending out
to buy my clothes, but I want them killed.

36:28.375 --> 36:33.083
- You could go yourself.
- I'm the most wanted man in America.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.875
I cannot exactly browse
the racks of JCPenneys.

36:37.208 --> 36:41.375
Just give me something that will blend in.
Something extremely American.

36:41.458 --> 36:44.625
Sir, we are ready to run the test.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.250
Magnificent.

37:24.083 --> 37:28.375
She must have plastic in her shoes.
It will eat any petroleum product.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.500
We're working on that.

37:38.708 --> 37:40.292
What happened to the bacteria?

37:40.375 --> 37:43.958
They live as long as they feed.
Once the oil is gone, they disappear.

37:44.042 --> 37:46.042
Just like my Jimmy Choos.

37:55.167 --> 37:56.375
Come in.

38:01.917 --> 38:03.125
Listen, about today...

38:03.208 --> 38:06.500
You could have stood up for me, you know.
I have to face those guys.

38:06.583 --> 38:08.250
So face them.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.458
Unless you want
to spend the rest of your life

38:10.542 --> 38:12.625
with your head in the trash can.

38:12.708 --> 38:16.542
Thanks for the advice, Bob.
All my problems are solved.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.792
They assign this in middle school?

38:26.875 --> 38:29.208
No, that's my pleasure reading.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.333
You're smart.

38:35.417 --> 38:38.917
You have a lot going for you.
Why do you make things up?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.042
Girls aren't exactly
impressed by astrophysics.

38:42.625 --> 38:46.250
Given the resources,
I could design, build and launch a rocket

38:46.333 --> 38:50.125
that would accurately circumscribe
an orbit of the moon.

38:50.208 --> 38:55.042
But other guys can, you know,
throw a ball through a hoop.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.000
I don't want you to get in trouble.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.125
I'll make you a deal.

39:02.208 --> 39:04.500
If you try to tell the truth from now on,

39:04.583 --> 39:06.583
I won't tell your mother about today.

39:06.667 --> 39:07.958
Really?

39:08.042 --> 39:10.042
Dude, that's almost cool.

39:10.542 --> 39:13.000
You mean for a guy who sells pens?

39:19.500 --> 39:21.625
Come on, kids, time for bed.

39:23.083 --> 39:25.208
Come on, one more spoonful.

39:52.667 --> 39:53.750
Nora.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.542
This one I learned it in China
when I was young.

41:00.542 --> 41:03.292
It's me. I need your help.

41:15.708 --> 41:18.292
I had to make up
one heck of a yarn to get all this stuff.

41:18.375 --> 41:19.625
What did you tell them?

41:19.708 --> 41:22.792
Well, let's just say if I don't find some
weapons-grade uranium by dawn,

41:22.875 --> 41:25.833
I'm in trouble.
What do you need all this for?

41:25.917 --> 41:28.333
To get the kids ready for school.

41:29.042 --> 41:32.292
Well, it's like my mom always used to say
when she was stationed over in East Berlin.

41:32.375 --> 41:36.292
She'd say, "Spying is easy.
Parenting is hard." Good luck.

41:51.667 --> 41:53.042
Bring it on.

41:54.250 --> 41:57.708
Farren, you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!

41:58.208 --> 42:00.958
Farren, let me in.

42:01.708 --> 42:04.708
Farren, let me in.

42:06.542 --> 42:10.125
Farren, you've been in there all morning!
Let me in!

42:10.208 --> 42:11.375
Farren.

42:12.208 --> 42:13.292
Hey!

42:14.458 --> 42:16.250
I guess it's my turn.

42:18.833 --> 42:21.625
And, Farren, please put on a longer skirt.

42:26.750 --> 42:28.292
This means war.

42:44.833 --> 42:45.917
Nora?

43:01.083 --> 43:02.208
Nora.

43:04.417 --> 43:05.917
Stay with Bob.

43:15.125 --> 43:16.708
Come on, Nora.

43:47.208 --> 43:49.625
- Where is he?
- Hiding.

43:49.708 --> 43:52.542
He's probably going to trick us
into opening the door.

43:52.625 --> 43:54.500
Help me put this away?

44:06.875 --> 44:09.250
lan. You know the rules.

44:10.208 --> 44:11.917
No soda upstairs.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.667
What? How did you...

44:36.500 --> 44:38.292
Breakfast is served.

44:39.333 --> 44:41.250
Wow!

44:42.958 --> 44:44.667
Nora, time for bed.

44:57.292 --> 44:58.750
Night-night.

45:01.958 --> 45:04.667
It's a school night. You should be asleep.

45:04.750 --> 45:06.750
How'd you find me?

45:06.833 --> 45:08.458
Call it a hunch.

45:22.500 --> 45:25.917
Why do you call your mother
Gillian instead of Mom?

45:26.000 --> 45:27.667
She's not my mom.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.250
What do you mean?

45:30.333 --> 45:32.667
My father was married before,

45:32.750 --> 45:34.833
and my real mom died when I was little.

45:34.917 --> 45:36.625
Gillian is just my stepmother.

45:36.708 --> 45:39.750
And lan and Nora
are just my half brother and sister.

45:39.833 --> 45:42.208
I'm like the freak of the family.

45:43.250 --> 45:45.625
It must have hurt your feelings when he left.

45:45.708 --> 45:47.500
He'll be back for me.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.583
I know he's not
the greatest dad in the world,

45:49.667 --> 45:53.292
but he loves me,
and he's not going to leave me here alone.

45:59.333 --> 46:00.542
Anyway,

46:00.625 --> 46:03.708
you should not climb the roof like this.
It's not safe.

46:03.792 --> 46:06.083
Please don't tell me I can't come up here.

46:06.167 --> 46:08.375
It's like the only place I can chill.

46:08.458 --> 46:11.875
Actually, I was going to
offer to build you a railing.

46:13.125 --> 46:15.750
Are you trying to bribe me into liking you?

46:15.833 --> 46:17.958
I just want you to be safe.

46:23.417 --> 46:25.500
Mind if I chill with you?

46:27.125 --> 46:28.875
It's a free country.

46:37.792 --> 46:39.417
Look at the star.

46:54.583 --> 46:57.708
Good news. We got an address.

47:00.958 --> 47:04.917
Good. Take some men.
Get that download back.

47:05.833 --> 47:07.167
Tatiana.

47:09.458 --> 47:11.000
No survivors.

47:14.500 --> 47:16.292
Hey, boss. You like?

47:22.500 --> 47:23.667
No like?

47:31.292 --> 47:34.000
May I make a couple
of fashion suggestions?

47:34.917 --> 47:38.792
Women don't like the shirt tucked in.
Mess up your hair.

47:39.917 --> 47:43.333
- You know about fashion?
- No, but I know women.

47:45.042 --> 47:48.875
Wear it like this.
It's cool, I saw it in a movie.

47:49.667 --> 47:53.708
What movie? Octopussy? This isn't 1985.

47:53.958 --> 47:57.000
- I almost forgot.
- What's this?

47:57.333 --> 48:00.667
- Iggy Pop and David Bowie in Shanghai.
- What?

48:00.750 --> 48:04.250
This is only about the hardest concert
to find in the world.

48:04.333 --> 48:07.500
I guarantee no one else
in the school district has it.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.250
- You downloaded this for me?
- Don't worry, I paid for it.

48:11.333 --> 48:14.792
- How'd you even know about it?
- Easy. I was there.

48:24.500 --> 48:27.750
Bob, you're getting too efficient.
We're half an hour early.

48:27.833 --> 48:29.375
You're welcome.

48:31.792 --> 48:33.417
Have a great day.

48:37.875 --> 48:41.250
- Hey, cool look, Aaron.
- Thanks. It's lan.

48:41.750 --> 48:43.000
Whatever.

49:09.167 --> 49:10.833
Have a great day.

49:11.708 --> 49:15.750
Look, the talk on the roof the other night
doesn't mean we're friends.

49:15.833 --> 49:17.167
God forbid.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.250
We're here. There is nobody around.

49:41.333 --> 49:46.333
I found the computer, but the file was
downloaded to an external storage device.

49:46.625 --> 49:48.292
I can't find that.

49:50.917 --> 49:53.708
I think I just figured out who lives here.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.500
Agent Ho.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.333
- Hello.
- You must stop shooting things, Antosha.

50:11.667 --> 50:14.917
I said it would be bad
if the CIA or Chinese had it.

50:15.333 --> 50:19.708
But he's both. Find him, but keep him alive.

50:20.458 --> 50:23.333
I need to know who else he's shown this to.

50:28.583 --> 50:32.458
Listen up. Now. Everyone in here.

50:34.750 --> 50:38.833
We must locate Chinese Intelligence agent,
Bob Ho.

50:39.333 --> 50:45.208
He is very tricky. The best at what he does.
He won't be easy to find.

50:45.750 --> 50:46.917
- Ms. Creel.
- Not now.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.750
Imagine you are Chinese, highly trained,
and you want to disappear.

50:51.833 --> 50:54.750
I see him climbing with
a bunch of skulls on a rope.

50:54.833 --> 50:59.083
Okay, he's not Conan the Barbarian.
Good try, though.

50:59.167 --> 51:00.958
No, I see him. There.

51:06.375 --> 51:07.583
Go. Go!

51:11.000 --> 51:13.708
Don't kill him yet. We need information.

51:25.542 --> 51:29.417
Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go! Go, Bob, go!

51:29.875 --> 51:32.667
Come here, sweetheart. Get back here.

51:35.750 --> 51:37.333
Come here!

51:45.958 --> 51:47.167
Let go!

51:50.167 --> 51:52.750
- Get the bad lady, Bob.
- Let go!

51:53.583 --> 51:55.792
- Can you hold my turtle?
- Not now.

52:04.167 --> 52:05.833
Yay, Bob!

52:06.417 --> 52:07.625
That's it.

52:08.375 --> 52:09.458
You will pay for that,

52:09.542 --> 52:11.500
- little American princess.
- Bob, help!

52:28.292 --> 52:30.042
Again, again, again.

52:32.375 --> 52:33.375
Okay.

52:39.333 --> 52:42.500
- Why did you pull us out of school?
- Who cares? We're out.

52:42.583 --> 52:44.542
Why are you in the front seat anyway?
It's my day.

52:44.625 --> 52:47.667
- No, it isn't. It's my day.
- No, it's not your day. You're the liar.

52:47.750 --> 52:50.917
- No, today is my day.
- No, today is my day.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.500
- You're a liar.
- No. No. No.

52:53.583 --> 52:56.500
- All right, quiet!
- I'm still hungry.

53:05.125 --> 53:08.417
It doesn't look like
they have chicken tenders here.

53:09.125 --> 53:11.625
Wait inside. I have to make a call.

53:19.792 --> 53:23.292
- This is Firefly.
- This is Bob Ho. I need help.

53:26.292 --> 53:28.625
Yeah, so I get pretty good grades
at this university.

53:28.708 --> 53:32.458
I'm top of the class.
I don't like to brag, but, you know.

53:32.542 --> 53:35.625
- Bob, this is Larry.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

53:35.833 --> 53:38.417
- Let's get some food.
- He goes to the university.

53:38.500 --> 53:40.625
He's a poet. Isn't it cool?

53:43.833 --> 53:49.500
It's rad. It's awesome. It's jiggy for shizzy.
It's the bomb.

53:50.792 --> 53:52.875
- Let's go.
- Hey!

53:55.458 --> 53:57.083
How embarrassing.

53:57.417 --> 54:00.417
You know, most people don't like me
when they first meet me.

54:00.500 --> 54:01.917
But Larry did.

54:04.375 --> 54:08.000
I have two words for you, Larry. Thirteen.

54:25.375 --> 54:26.875
I have to go.

54:27.792 --> 54:32.833
All right, Nora. Come on.
You two stay at the table.

54:36.875 --> 54:37.917
No, no, no.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.833
I can't go in there.

54:51.792 --> 54:53.333
Boys are pigs.

54:57.875 --> 54:59.125
Careful.

55:09.458 --> 55:12.333
And the lion jumped on me,
and I killed him with my bare hands,

55:12.417 --> 55:14.125
and I saved the colonel's life.

55:14.208 --> 55:16.208
- You're brave.
- Thanks.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.208
How about this, Bob? The whole restaurant
and the waitress sat Larry here.

55:22.292 --> 55:25.292
- Isn't it great?
- It's like it's fate or something.

55:25.375 --> 55:27.583
Really, sir, we're just goofing around.

55:27.667 --> 55:30.417
- Hey, Nora. Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

55:30.750 --> 55:33.167
- Irish stew.
- Irish stew who?

55:33.667 --> 55:35.917
Irish stew in the name of the law.

55:38.917 --> 55:42.208
Larry was telling me all about
the university. It sounds great.

55:42.292 --> 55:45.250
- I'd be glad to give you a tour sometime.
- When pigs fly.

55:45.333 --> 55:47.208
It's not up to you. You're not my dad.

55:47.292 --> 55:51.333
No, but I know that your mother
hasn't completely lost her mind.

55:51.417 --> 55:52.917
It's just a tour, Bob.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.917
It's not like he's asking me out on a date
or anything.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.250
Are you?

55:58.375 --> 56:00.625
No, it's just a friendly offer.

56:00.708 --> 56:03.917
Even if it was a date,
you still couldn't stop me.

56:09.042 --> 56:12.250
- What's your major, Larry?
- English Lit.

56:12.667 --> 56:14.833
Would you pass the soy sauce?

56:15.875 --> 56:18.833
That way I get a background in the classics.

56:24.083 --> 56:28.250
- You speak Russian, Larry?
- What's going on?

56:47.375 --> 56:51.333
- This is going to be painful.
- You're right about that.

56:55.042 --> 56:56.417
Go, go, go.

57:04.167 --> 57:06.500
Maybe you'll write a poem about this.

57:15.875 --> 57:17.375
Goodbye, Larry.

57:34.042 --> 57:35.375
Fine. He's too old for me.

57:35.458 --> 57:39.500
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore.
I want to be a cyborg.

57:40.375 --> 57:43.042
How did he find us so fast?
It doesn't make sense.

57:43.125 --> 57:45.917
- Bob, what's going on?
- Please quiet, I'm trying to think.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.375
What do you mean, you're trying to think?

57:47.458 --> 57:50.292
- You just threw a man out the window...
- Who is he? What is...

57:50.375 --> 57:52.750
All right, all right, fine. Fine.

57:53.667 --> 57:58.458
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA
from the Chinese Intelligence Service.

57:58.542 --> 58:03.083
Someone wants me dead,
and "Larry" was a Russian operative, okay?

58:03.625 --> 58:05.375
Fine. Don't tell us.

58:07.125 --> 58:08.250
Cool.

58:13.625 --> 58:15.583
Why would he come alone?

58:17.167 --> 58:18.500
Stay here.

58:21.708 --> 58:23.792
- Where are the kids?
- Inside.

58:24.083 --> 58:26.917
Nothing else matters
until these kids are safe. Nothing.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.417
Of course. Colton set up that safe house
for them like you requested.

58:30.500 --> 58:34.125
- Hey, got that file on you?
- What file?

58:34.583 --> 58:37.375
The one Colton linked you to,
from Poldark's computer, your download.

58:37.458 --> 58:40.542
I didn't download it.
I never even got it open.

58:40.917 --> 58:43.958
Don't BS me, Bob. It's classified material.
I need all copies.

58:44.042 --> 58:46.000
Why would you think I downloaded it?

58:46.125 --> 58:49.292
Unless someone told you I had,
someone who wanted it back.

58:49.375 --> 58:51.500
Let's not make this thing
harder than it has to be, Bob.

58:51.583 --> 58:53.250
Give me the file.

58:53.333 --> 58:55.917
You're a career officer. Why do this?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.750
I want out. Same as you.
We're both leaving for love.

58:58.833 --> 59:02.208
Only I love money
and Anton Poldark is match. com. The file.

59:05.250 --> 59:08.250
Wait. Take it easy.

59:15.167 --> 59:16.167
Good work.

59:16.583 --> 59:17.583
No.

59:22.458 --> 59:27.083
Can I just say, you are by far
the coolest guy my mom has ever dated.

59:28.917 --> 59:31.833
At least now I know how
that kid Larry found us so fast.

59:31.917 --> 59:33.500
- How?
- The watch.

59:34.083 --> 59:38.083
Glaze told me to keep the watch.
It must have a tracking device.

59:39.125 --> 59:44.625
- Wow. You really are a spy.
- Gillian is totally going to freak.

01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:08.500
What are you doing?

01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:12.833
There's iron in these rocks.
It will hide the signal. Watch, please.

01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:16.042
You realize if I told anyone at school
this story,

01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:18.917
I'd get detention for a year for lying.

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:28.708
- Yes.
- Hey, partner. Where're you at?

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:34.083
- Why do you ask?
- I needed to pick up that file I sent you.

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:36.417
You know,
the one I wanted you to open for me.

01:00:39.917 --> 01:00:41.792
Bob, you there?

01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:45.083
Colton, I never thought
you would have sold out to Poldark.

01:00:45.167 --> 01:00:49.750
Hey, that's crazy, man. Something's wrong.
We need to get together and talk.

01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:54.458
- Nice try.
- Bob? Bob?

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:06.542
- We'll be safe here. I promise.
- This is your plan? Hide out in a hotel?

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:10.417
Doesn't look like they have
chicken tenders here, either.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:30.500
This is awesome.
Can we order room service?

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:33.125
- Are you crazy? I'm going home.
- No.

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:36.917
- The only place you're safe is with me.
- Safe with you?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.542
- Everybody's trying to kill you.
- I know. Isn't it cool?

01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:45.333
Hey, Bob, if you want to marry my mom,
I'll personally write the invitations.

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.208
Love you, Bob.

01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:32.583
Be realistic, Bob.

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:39.083
- Hello.
- Hi, Gillian.

01:02:39.167 --> 01:02:40.917
Hi, sweetheart.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.500
Yeah, Grandpa just fell asleep.
I was gonna call you guys.

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:46.625
I have to tell you something.

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:50.000
I know this is going to hurt you,
but I have to tell you.

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:52.667
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:56.000
- It's about Bob.
- What about him?

01:02:56.083 --> 01:02:59.667
He's not who you think he is.
He's a spy, a Chinese spy.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:03.125
And these terrorists are trying to kill him,
and now the CIA's after him, too, and they...

01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:06.708
Farren, I know you don't like Bob,
but come on.

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:09.333
I'd expect this from lan, but not from you.

01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:13.542
What? No, it's true. He's going
to get us all killed. Don't you even care?

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:16.875
Farren, this conversation is over.
Put Bob on.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:26.000
Hi, Gillian.

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:29.375
Bob, I am so sorry.
I don't know what's gotten into her.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.458
- It's true.
- What is?

01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:37.417
Everything she said is all true.

01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:40.333
Whatever this is, it isn't funny.

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:42.250
The kids are safe, I promise.

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:45.208
I'll give them to you
as soon as you get back.

01:03:45.625 --> 01:03:49.792
You're either telling me the truth
or I've left my kids with a nut job.

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.375
Either way, you should come and get them.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.542
So, you got any other cool spy stuff,
besides the watch?

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:26.583
Don't touch. It's very sharp.

01:04:27.417 --> 01:04:29.208
Cool. What else?

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:41.417
Cool.

01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:59.208
Sorry, mister.

01:05:01.083 --> 01:05:02.708
Airport. Step on it.

01:05:24.167 --> 01:05:27.833
- Bob? Are you awake?
- Are you kidding?

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:33.458
- Does he always snore like that?
- Can't you hear him next door?

01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:36.208
I always thought it was the pig.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.333
It's over with you and Gillian, isn't it?

01:05:44.417 --> 01:05:46.333
Yes, Farren, it's over.

01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:51.667
- You win.
- Then why don't I feel like I won?

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:55.958
If you really loved her,
you wouldn't give up this easily.

01:05:56.833 --> 01:06:02.000
It's because I love her and the three of you
that I have to walk away.

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:05.333
It's more important that you're safe.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.542
I thought I could put my other life
behind me, but I can't.

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:15.042
Be glad.
You're lucky you're not joining this family.

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:22.500
You've no idea what it's like to live in
a place where you totally don't belong.

01:06:22.583 --> 01:06:25.708
Don't be so sure. I was an orphan.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:31.125
I was raised in a group home.
I never knew my parents, but I had a family.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.042
I had dozens of brothers and sisters there.

01:06:35.417 --> 01:06:39.542
And I wasn't related to any of them,
but I loved them all.

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:44.667
Family isn't whose blood you carry.

01:06:45.792 --> 01:06:48.667
It's who you love and who loves you.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.000
- Gillian!
- Mom!

01:07:06.917 --> 01:07:10.833
Gillian, I'm really sorry about everything.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.667
Tell me the truth. Are you really a spy?

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:27.000
Yes, I am. I was going to tell you at dinner,
but you stopped me.

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:31.708
I don't care. You put my children in danger.

01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:34.167
Just go.

01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:44.667
Bob, when are we going to see you again?

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:48.333
You're not.

01:07:58.625 --> 01:08:03.208
Please don't go away.
Who's gonna sing me China songs?

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:16.792
- You'll be safe. I promise.
- Stay away from my children.

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:10.082
Dear Mom, I am very sorry,
but I cannot stay here.

01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:13.417
My destiny is to be a spy, like Bob.

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:23.250
I am going with him.
Best wishes, your son, lan.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:08.542
Ho's signal just popped back up.
We got him.

01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:12.292
Let's roll.

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:40.042
Bob! Bob!

01:10:41.167 --> 01:10:43.208
- lan.
- You left your watch.

01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:45.875
What are you doing here? Let's go.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.500
What do you mean? We just got here.

01:10:59.833 --> 01:11:04.792
Bob Ho. What a coincidence. Tie them up.

01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:14.958
- What are you doing here, lan?
- I'm coming with you.

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:16.500
I want to be a spy, too.

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:21.375
Is this the bad guy?
I thought he'd be better dressed.

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:26.792
- How did you find me?
- I found one of your tracking devices

01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:29.458
and put it in your pocket
when I hugged you goodbye.

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:31.708
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:35.375
- Can we go back to business?
- Would it help to mention I'm retired?

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.708
Retired men don't download secrets.

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:40.625
- I never downloaded anything.
- He's lying.

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:44.833
Who are you going to believe?
Me or the traitor?

01:11:45.458 --> 01:11:48.792
Someone has been a very naughty boy.

01:11:49.708 --> 01:11:53.583
He's got cameras and microphones
mounted all over the place.

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:56.833
Good plan, filming us together.

01:11:57.417 --> 01:12:00.625
- How could you turn against your country?
- It's simple.

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:03.167
I'm gonna be a billionaire.

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:07.958
That file that you didn't download?
It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.

01:12:08.042 --> 01:12:12.042
This stuff literally eats oil.
Can you imagine?

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.375
Overnight,
all the world's oil supplies go poof.

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:20.167
All except for Russia's.
It'll be priceless, right, comrade?

01:12:20.958 --> 01:12:22.792
How did you get Colt to go along with you?

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:25.625
Colt? That hillbilly's not part of this.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.375
He doesn't know what goes on
in the real world.

01:12:27.458 --> 01:12:29.458
He still thinks wrestling is real.

01:12:29.542 --> 01:12:32.292
Let the boy go.
He has nothing to do with this.

01:12:32.375 --> 01:12:36.000
Mr. Chit-Chat just laid out our whole plan.

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:42.208
We cannot let him go.

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:46.542
- He will tell.
- Trust me, no one would believe him.

01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:48.958
He's right about that.

01:12:51.208 --> 01:12:54.958
Hey, boss. Look at what I found
sneaking around outside.

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.042
- Farren?
- Hi, everybody.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.792
Please, have a seat.

01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:03.750
This can't be happening.

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:09.542
Poldark, let the children go
and I will find this GBH file for you.

01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:12.958
GBH? Like, Stockholm GBH?

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:16.792
- How do you know that?
- No freaking way.

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:19.875
You're telling me all of this is
because he downloaded a bootleg concert?

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.458
You did what?

01:13:22.458 --> 01:13:24.375
You downloaded it?

01:13:24.458 --> 01:13:27.375
Wow, these companies take piracy
way too seriously.

01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:30.625
You were messing with my computer?
That's private.

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:32.625
I just wanted to seem cool.

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:35.417
You don't need to. You are cool.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:39.708
- You're one of the coolest kids I know.
- Really? Thanks.

01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:43.333
Hey, over here. Man with a gun.

01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:46.958
Wait a minute.
I am one of the only kids you know.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.625
- Where is the file?
- It's on my iPod, on my desk at home.

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:57.750
Now, see, you want to be a spy.
Never tell the truth to the bad guy.

01:13:58.125 --> 01:14:00.250
Sorry, I'm new at this.

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:04.917
Tatiana, take some men to the kid's house
and find the iPod.

01:14:05.792 --> 01:14:07.875
What if the family is home?

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:12.250
Ever since you dyed your hair blonde...
Kill them.

01:14:12.333 --> 01:14:15.958
- No, don't!
- Go, bring me that iPod.

01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:17.875
Come on, go. Go.

01:14:30.792 --> 01:14:33.042
Now, as for you...

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:07.458
Awesome!

01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:24.458
Farren, let's go.

01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:29.542
- I call dibs on the front.
- Then I pick the radio station.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.500
Okay. Ready?

01:15:36.583 --> 01:15:38.083
Okay, hold on.

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:42.083
- Hello?
- Gillian, listen to me.

01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:44.250
Goodbye, Bob.

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:55.167
Gillian, wait. Don't hang up.

01:15:58.667 --> 01:16:01.750
Hang on.
We've got to get there before they do.

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:11.208
Is there anyone at the agency
you can still trust? Someone you can call?

01:16:11.292 --> 01:16:14.875
Sure, but they tore out my cameras.
I have no proof of anything.

01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:20.125
Except that, as it happens, I recorded
that entire conversation on my cell phone.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.583
Way to go, dork.

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:30.917
Colt... Just listen.
I'm going to play you something.

01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:36.958
That file that you didn't download?
It's a formula for a Growth Bacteria Hybrid.

01:16:37.042 --> 01:16:39.417
This stuff literally eats oil.

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:45.208
What is this?

01:16:45.292 --> 01:16:47.625
- It's Halloween.
- It's Halloween.

01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:59.375
- Happy Halloween.
- Bob!

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.625
What are you all doing?
I thought you were upstairs.

01:17:05.958 --> 01:17:08.333
- Everybody inside.
- Bob, we need to talk.

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:11.458
Mom, this isn't a joke. Do whatever he says.

01:17:12.542 --> 01:17:13.917
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:17:14.458 --> 01:17:16.500
- Get your iPod.
- His iPod?

01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:18.667
- I demand an explanation.
- They're coming.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.167
- Who?
- The Russians.

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:21.250
Russians?

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:40.292
I saw them outside. They're coming.

01:17:40.875 --> 01:17:42.833
- Russians?
- Yes, Gillian, Russians.

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:44.000
Let's try and keep up.

01:17:47.625 --> 01:17:50.875
It's too late. Everybody upstairs.
Understand me?

01:17:52.125 --> 01:17:53.458
Stay there.

01:17:57.625 --> 01:17:58.708
Where's my stuff?

01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:01.333
- Here, take some of this stuff.
- What is all this?

01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:02.750
Protection.

01:18:04.542 --> 01:18:07.500
Why do you have a lighter?
I don't want you playing with fire.

01:18:15.542 --> 01:18:18.000
Okay, maybe just this once. Let's go.

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:19.417
Trick or treat.

01:18:48.917 --> 01:18:52.333
Hurry. Close it. Close it quick. Okay.

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:11.500
- I forgot Chuckle.
- Nora! Nora!

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.042
What are you supposed to be?

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:20.333
A cyborg,
sent from the future to blast you away.

01:19:29.042 --> 01:19:31.000
Mommy, that man can fly.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:59.917
I can't believe you did this to my family,
endangered my kids.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.375
I didn't mean to. I love your kids.

01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:05.083
I want to marry you, all four of you.

01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:07.208
And I wanted to marry you.

01:20:07.292 --> 01:20:09.958
But our wedding gifts would have
to be opened by the bomb squad.

01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:13.000
All right, Ho. Enough games.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:24.958
I finally found a normal guy, I thought,
someone who likes to...

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.958
Can we talk about this later?

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.000
- He switched belts.
- Get him.

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.458
Give me the iPod, kid.

01:21:09.208 --> 01:21:12.792
- Come on, let's TP the little geek's house.
- Yeah, TP.

01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:25.792
Hey, guys.

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:28.875
Gotta go.

01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:31.583
Maybe we should just stick
to stealing candy from little kids.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:33.542
Yeah, real little kids.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.917
- This is going to be fun.
- Hey, Larry. Knock, knock.

01:21:44.917 --> 01:21:45.917
Yes!

01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:06.625
Come on, guys, get in the room
and lock the door. Hurry. Lock it.

01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:30.000
Irish stew in the name of the law.

01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:34.083
Sorry your retirement was so short, Bob.

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:40.875
- You can kill me. Let the family go.
- I can't. They've seen too much.

01:22:40.958 --> 01:22:42.958
But I'll let you go first
so you don't have to watch.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.458
Hey, mister.

01:22:51.458 --> 01:22:53.833
Don't think this changes anything.

01:22:54.208 --> 01:22:56.958
- Everybody freeze!
- It's okay.

01:22:57.625 --> 01:22:59.500
They're the good guys.

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:07.333
You stinking lowlife. Come on. Let's go.

01:23:12.417 --> 01:23:13.417
Mom!

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.750
Hey, loosen these things up.

01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:25.167
I'm sorry. What's wrong?
Got the handcuffs too tight?

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:29.292
I don't know how these things work.
I'm just a dumb hillbilly.

01:23:30.792 --> 01:23:33.000
- Everybody okay?
- Bumps and bruises.

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:35.583
lan, this really is the good guy.

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:41.083
Hey, what you got there, son?

01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:46.042
Nice work recording that conversation,
partner.

01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:49.375
This young man might make
a heck of a spy someday.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.750
How quickly can you give me
orange jumpsuit?

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:05.458
I'm sorry I suspected you.

01:24:05.542 --> 01:24:07.417
Don't worry about it, old buddy.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.125
Chalk it up to the language barrier.

01:24:10.792 --> 01:24:12.125
Thank you.

01:24:24.792 --> 01:24:27.458
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:31.250
Goodbye, Gillian.

01:24:33.958 --> 01:24:35.583
Goodbye, kids.

01:24:38.333 --> 01:24:39.458
Bob.

01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:44.208
I'm gonna miss you.

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:46.125
I'll miss you, too.

01:24:53.625 --> 01:24:55.000
Wait.

01:24:56.333 --> 01:24:59.375
I know he lied, but he did it to protect us.

01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:03.333
This whole time, all he ever wanted to do
was protect us, Mom.

01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:06.333
And, Mom,

01:25:10.958 --> 01:25:14.792
you're never gonna find a man
as good as Bob, never again.

01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:16.208
Never.

01:25:17.292 --> 01:25:20.083
I never thought I'd say this,

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:22.292
but I agree with Farren.

01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:29.042
I suppose you have something to say, too.

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:31.542
I want Bob to be my daddy.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.083
Do you, Gillian, take Bob
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

01:25:49.167 --> 01:25:51.042
I do.

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:55.000
And do you, Bob, take Gillian
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:25:57.875 --> 01:25:59.125
Gillian.

01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:02.917
There's one more thing I have to tell you.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.292
My name really isn't Bob.

01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:11.250
That's okay.

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:13.833
I do.

01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:18.125
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

01:26:31.667 --> 01:26:34.500
Ready. And action.

01:26:51.625 --> 01:26:52.750
And cut.

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:03.917
No, that man's so crooked,
he could eat nails and...

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.917
Maybe he just wanted
to fill up his gas tanks for free.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.042
I can't blame him.

01:27:07.125 --> 01:27:10.750
No, that man's so crooked,
he could eat nails and...

01:27:14.458 --> 01:27:15.458
Sorry.

01:27:15.542 --> 01:27:17.292
Sorry, mister.

01:27:28.792 --> 01:27:30.250
All right.

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:35.542
What's going on?

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:38.500
Bob, I don't want to be a princess anymore.

01:27:38.583 --> 01:27:40.833
I want to be a...

01:27:42.292 --> 01:27:46.625
I'm an international spy, on loan to the CIA
from the Chinese...

01:27:47.333 --> 01:27:49.792
From the Chinese intelligent... Intelligent?

01:27:49.875 --> 01:27:52.042
- Intelligence.
- Intelligence.

01:27:53.958 --> 01:27:57.667
Well, I'll just pick a few things
and move to the house.

01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:00.292
- Okay, cut.
- What does it mean?

01:28:00.792 --> 01:28:04.833
I am international spy, on loan to the CIA
from the Chinese intelligent...

01:28:04.917 --> 01:28:06.625
- What?
- Intelligent.

01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:11.458
I've brought down dictators.
How tough to say...

01:28:12.583 --> 01:28:14.125
- Yeah.
- Yes?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.375
Maybe you'll write a poem about...

01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:23.125
A poem about... A poem.

01:28:23.792 --> 01:28:26.333
Maybe you'll write a poem...

01:28:26.958 --> 01:28:29.667
Maybe write... I hate English.

01:28:38.917 --> 01:28:42.458
If a man marries you,
he marries all four of you.

01:28:43.292 --> 01:28:45.542
Don't forget the pig, the cat and the turkey.

01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.750
And the turkey.

01:28:49.708 --> 01:28:52.583
- Turkey? Where's the turkey come from?
- I don't know.

01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:56.708
- Yeah, well, my grandmother's... Sorry.
- Okay, cut.

01:28:59.708 --> 01:29:01.958
Grandmother's great. He plays...

01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:04.208
Let's cut.

01:29:04.292 --> 01:29:07.542
When they forget a dialogue,
it makes me happy.

01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:12.500
Good work. Come out. Camera needs you.

01:29:13.625 --> 01:29:14.875
Come on.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:16.833
What are we doing?

01:29:16.917 --> 01:29:20.375
What are you doing? We're filming.
We're making a movie.

01:29:22.083 --> 01:29:23.958
Funny man. Funny man.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:25.750
A camera mark.
