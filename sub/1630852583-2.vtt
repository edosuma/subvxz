00:33.258 --> 00:36.523
-Hey, Ems?

00:36.623 --> 00:38.626
We gotta get you to bed, kid.
It's late.

00:40.429 --> 00:42.433
Emma, please answer me,
sweetie.

00:43.675 --> 00:45.678
Emma?
Come on.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.467
Ems?

00:51.567 --> 00:53.310
Emma, this isn't funny!
Open up!

00:53.410 --> 00:55.874
Emma!

00:55.974 --> 00:57.437
Emma, answer me right now!

00:57.537 --> 01:00.882
Emma! Emma!

01:13.482 --> 01:15.986
Please, please, please, please!

01:16.086 --> 01:18.089
Please!

01:22.817 --> 01:26.082
Just stay with me, OK?

01:26.182 --> 01:28.185
Daddy's here, baby.
Daddy's here, daddy's here,
daddy's here!

01:34.435 --> 01:37.580
Please, please, please...

01:45.493 --> 01:46.915
Help!

01:47.015 --> 01:49.019
Help!!

01:54.828 --> 01:56.571
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.

01:56.671 --> 01:58.674
My daughter.
She's 11 years old.

02:24.755 --> 02:26.178
How's she doing?

02:28.481 --> 02:30.645
She's gonna be OK.

02:36.013 --> 02:36.975
♪ Gitchy, gitchy

02:37.055 --> 02:38.678
♪ Ooh, la-la

02:38.778 --> 02:40.841
♪ Do run-run

02:40.941 --> 02:43.646
♪ You won't get far

02:43.746 --> 02:47.892
♪ I'm machine, obsolete

02:55.004 --> 02:57.348
What about the psychiatrist?

02:57.448 --> 03:00.032
What about
the psychiatrist?

03:00.132 --> 03:02.596
Any progress?

03:02.696 --> 03:04.699
Doesn't seem like it, does it?

03:05.741 --> 03:09.126
Sarah...

03:09.226 --> 03:10.969
Do you think what I did
could have made this happen?

03:11.069 --> 03:13.072
Gary, don't talk like that.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.241
But what if it did?

03:21.326 --> 03:23.109
What if she's so terrified
about losing someone again

03:23.209 --> 03:26.073
that she would...
rather check out first?

03:27.816 --> 03:29.819
She's awake.

03:34.627 --> 03:36.630
You need to
call an ambulance next time.

03:51.894 --> 03:53.897
Hello, Emma.

04:15.612 --> 04:17.615
Hmm.

04:19.939 --> 04:21.722
Do you know
why you did it, Emma?

04:21.822 --> 04:24.366
No.

04:24.466 --> 04:26.469
Did you want to harm yourself?

04:29.194 --> 04:31.297
It's important that you
answer that, Emma.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.400
No.

04:35.283 --> 04:38.028
Then, why did you do it?

04:38.128 --> 04:40.131
I was scared.

04:41.253 --> 04:43.256
Scared of what?

04:46.020 --> 04:48.024
I was scared that it
was going to happen again.

04:50.788 --> 04:52.791
The panic attacks?

05:15.507 --> 05:18.212
Why don't we try you
on new medication?

05:18.312 --> 05:19.754
Certainly wouldn't have
put yourself in that position

05:19.834 --> 05:21.978
if the fluoxetine had worked.

05:22.078 --> 05:24.181
And we'll make sure
Dad's responsible

05:24.281 --> 05:26.285
for handing out the tablets
this time, yeah?

05:33.135 --> 05:35.139
How'd it go?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.657
Oh. OK.

05:46.757 --> 05:48.660
Where's the car?

05:48.760 --> 05:50.343
Dropped it off at home.

05:50.443 --> 05:51.785
Thought, uh,
you and I could walk,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.067
maybe get a little exercise.

05:53.167 --> 05:55.170
I did PE today.

06:18.648 --> 06:19.910
What should we do tonight?

06:20.010 --> 06:22.474
Should we...

06:22.574 --> 06:24.577
watch a movie?

06:30.747 --> 06:32.750
- Should we get a dog?
- Why?

06:34.513 --> 06:36.516
Why not?

06:47.814 --> 06:49.677
Wanna order some... pizza?

08:04.496 --> 08:06.500
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to grab the maple syrup.

08:24.929 --> 08:27.193
- I'm not hungry.
- Bubs,

08:27.293 --> 08:29.476
you barely touched your food
last night.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.481
I wasn't hungry last night.

08:32.581 --> 08:34.364
Please? I don't think I can
handle an eating disorder

08:34.464 --> 08:36.467
on top of everything else.

08:39.993 --> 08:41.996
Sorry.

08:54.416 --> 08:56.419
What am I meant to do, Em?

09:00.065 --> 09:02.068
I'm here, OK?

09:03.911 --> 09:05.914
You've gotta help me
so that I can help you.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.762
You need to talk to someone?

09:11.924 --> 09:14.508
I mean, other than Trevor?

09:14.608 --> 09:17.313
You know you can always talk
to your Aunty Sarah, right?

09:17.413 --> 09:20.397
You can tell her anything.
Anything.

09:20.497 --> 09:23.282
And it can just
stay between you both.

09:23.382 --> 09:24.384
You don't need to tell me
what you talk about.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.729
Why do you do all this?

09:27.829 --> 09:30.393
- What?
- You go on and on about me!

09:33.038 --> 09:35.042
That makes no sense, baby.
You're my entire world.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.787
Why do I have to talk to you?

09:38.887 --> 09:41.231
You don't talk to me.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.673
About what?

09:42.773 --> 09:44.676
About your stuff.

09:44.776 --> 09:47.400
The only thing
I've got going on right now

09:47.500 --> 09:49.844
is worrying about you.

09:49.944 --> 09:51.767
You don't have a life.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.253
What?

09:55.353 --> 09:57.356
You're unhappy.

10:03.165 --> 10:06.731
It is my job
to hold things together.

10:09.335 --> 10:10.998
It's what
parents are meant to do,

10:11.098 --> 10:13.261
hold things together
to help keep you safe.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.628
Maybe you should help yourself.

10:27.404 --> 10:29.407
- I miss your mother so much...
- Oh, my God.

10:50.481 --> 10:52.384
Hey, you two!

10:52.484 --> 10:54.487
Bye, bubs!

10:56.170 --> 10:58.634
How is she?

10:58.734 --> 11:01.038
We started the new medication.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.480
Told her she could
talk to you about anything.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.006
OK.
I'll gently encourage that.

11:06.106 --> 11:08.009
I don't even need to know
whatever she wants to
talk about.

11:08.109 --> 11:12.135
I'll just come pick her up.
I won't even ask.

11:12.235 --> 11:14.058
Maybe this is a bad idea?
No, it's not, Gary.

11:14.158 --> 11:16.022
It's been three weeks.

11:16.122 --> 11:18.145
Don't worry.
She's not gonna leave my sight.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.028
Stay out
as long as you need to.

11:20.128 --> 11:21.831
Don't cut it short
if it's going well.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.435
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

11:24.535 --> 11:26.839
Pretty sure
the woman I'm meeting

11:26.939 --> 11:28.581
is just using this opportunity
to practice speaking English.

11:28.662 --> 11:29.884
What makes you think that?

11:29.984 --> 11:31.286
Her Bumble profile

11:31.386 --> 11:32.728
says she's studying English

11:32.828 --> 11:34.371
and need to practice.

11:34.471 --> 11:36.374
Oh. Well...

11:39.719 --> 11:42.384
Thanks, Sarah.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.867
- Just keep an eye on her.
- Gary.

11:44.967 --> 11:45.528
- Call me if
there's any issues...
- Stop worrying!

11:45.608 --> 11:47.151
Have fun. Bye!

12:42.379 --> 12:44.382
You have door-ta.

12:45.905 --> 12:48.609
Daughter. Daughter.

12:48.709 --> 12:49.971
Daughter.

12:50.071 --> 12:52.074
Yeah.

12:53.396 --> 12:55.400
What is she name?

12:56.922 --> 12:59.867
Her name is Emma.

12:59.967 --> 13:01.970
- Emma.
- Yeah.

13:05.376 --> 13:08.000
My name is Mi-Gyung Cho.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.103
I know.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.629
Yes.

13:14.430 --> 13:16.433
Your name Gary.

13:17.715 --> 13:19.718
Yes. Yep. Yeah.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.064
OK, teach me.

13:23.164 --> 13:26.109
Teach you? Right. Teach you.

13:26.209 --> 13:29.154
Um, let's see.
This is a shopping mall.

13:29.254 --> 13:30.796
Shopping mall.

13:30.896 --> 13:32.279
Very good.

13:32.379 --> 13:36.325
This is a date.

13:36.425 --> 13:38.428
We are on a date.

13:40.191 --> 13:42.194
- This is...
- Mm.

13:47.242 --> 13:49.746
Right, well, I'm just this way.

13:49.846 --> 13:52.551
Mmm.

13:52.651 --> 13:54.714
- Oh!

13:54.814 --> 13:56.397
- Ow!
- I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

13:56.497 --> 13:58.721
Where did you come from?
What the fuck is that?

13:58.821 --> 13:59.662
- It's a chai tea latte.
- Why is it so fucking hot?

13:59.742 --> 14:01.685
I like it that way.

14:01.785 --> 14:03.789
I'm gonna get you water,
I promise. And napkins.

14:05.551 --> 14:06.613
I'm just taking these.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.578
Here. Come on.

14:09.678 --> 14:12.102
Oh, my God. I mean, I can't
understand how I managed to...

14:12.202 --> 14:13.985
I feel like I made it worse.

14:14.085 --> 14:16.028
The problem is that

14:16.128 --> 14:18.152
you really need to stop
drinking stuff that hot.

14:18.252 --> 14:20.916
- It's not...
- It's so bad
for your oesophagus.

14:21.016 --> 14:23.019
But, like, this clicker thing
is never gonna work.

14:25.463 --> 14:29.129
I...
I need to know what I did.

14:29.229 --> 14:31.292
Did I say something wrong?
Did I do something wrong?

14:31.392 --> 14:33.296
- Did I offend you?
- No, you didn't.

14:33.396 --> 14:34.578
You did nothing wrong.

14:34.678 --> 14:36.781
Then, what?

14:36.881 --> 14:39.506
I'm, um...
I'm a complicated person, Gary.

14:39.606 --> 14:42.030
I have a really
complicated life. I...

14:42.130 --> 14:43.211
I honestly shouldn't have
gone out with you

14:43.291 --> 14:44.073
in the first place.

14:44.173 --> 14:46.837
OK.

14:46.937 --> 14:48.680
I mean...
Didn't mean it like that. Fuck.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.284
I just meant
I shouldn't have...

14:51.384 --> 14:54.369
Ugh! I shouldn't have
put myself in that position.

14:54.469 --> 14:56.292
- I get it.
- I wasn't thinking
anything through.

14:56.392 --> 14:57.815
- I get it.
- No, you don't.

14:57.915 --> 14:59.377
- Then tell me.
- I can't.

14:59.477 --> 15:01.020
Why?

15:01.120 --> 15:03.123
Because it's...

15:05.046 --> 15:07.029
I've... got baggage.

15:07.129 --> 15:09.233
- I've got baggage.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.997
You don't have my baggage.

15:12.097 --> 15:14.141
Then, what's your baggage?

15:20.471 --> 15:22.654
I'm a 40-year-old,
single father

15:22.754 --> 15:24.137
who has a daughter
who needs to be medicated

15:24.237 --> 15:25.980
because nobody knows
how to help.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.063
I don't even know
how to help her.

15:28.163 --> 15:30.106
There was an accident.

15:30.206 --> 15:32.209
She almost killed herself.

15:35.414 --> 15:38.279
I know I need to be
a source of stability for her,

15:38.379 --> 15:41.124
but I don't know
how much longer

15:41.224 --> 15:43.227
I can keep up this facade
before she watches me drown.

15:48.756 --> 15:52.001
Emma was four when Lisa died.

15:55.927 --> 15:58.151
We'd just brought this
perfect, chubby little baby
into the world,

15:58.251 --> 16:00.254
and then Lisa
was diagnosed.

16:02.257 --> 16:04.681
She was so beautiful, Emma.

16:04.781 --> 16:07.365
It was as if she'd been
plucked from the universe

16:07.465 --> 16:09.469
and given to us as this gift.

16:11.552 --> 16:14.296
Lisa hung on
as long as she could.

16:14.396 --> 16:17.622
She fought so hard.

16:17.722 --> 16:19.385
Tried every kind of chemo,
every treatment possible,

16:19.485 --> 16:23.551
but the cancer was just...
so fucking aggressive.

16:23.651 --> 16:26.235
Just never let her go.

16:26.335 --> 16:28.719
It just got worse and worse.

16:28.819 --> 16:30.943
And worse and worse
and worse and worse.

16:34.268 --> 16:36.271
I didn't want Emma
to see her mom like that.

16:37.714 --> 16:40.458
So I didn't let her.

16:40.558 --> 16:43.543
I made the decision that
that shouldn't be

16:43.643 --> 16:45.827
the last image
she saw of her mom,

16:45.927 --> 16:47.930
because it wasn't
her mom anymore.

16:50.814 --> 16:52.818
Then Lisa died.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.126
And I left.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.229
I couldn't cope,
so I just fucking left.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.777
Six months.

17:04.877 --> 17:06.880
Gone.

17:09.305 --> 17:11.488
I feel so ashamed.

17:11.588 --> 17:13.592
So unbelievably ashamed
of what I did.

17:20.563 --> 17:22.306
But I couldn't be around

17:22.406 --> 17:23.788
anything that reminded me
of her.

17:23.888 --> 17:25.751
I had to leave it all behind -

17:25.851 --> 17:28.956
our house, our stuff,

17:29.056 --> 17:31.059
our life...

17:32.902 --> 17:34.905
Our daughter.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.595
Lisa's family looked after Emma
while I was gone.

17:43.359 --> 17:45.302
I owe them so much.

17:45.402 --> 17:47.405
They've forgiven me.

17:50.731 --> 17:52.734
I don't know if Emma
really understands what I did.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.762
Then I see...

17:57.862 --> 18:02.690
my little girl
in a hospital bed...

18:02.790 --> 18:04.793
oxygen mask on her face...

18:06.396 --> 18:08.880
Did I do it?
Is it my fault?

18:14.929 --> 18:16.932
That's my baggage.

18:20.097 --> 18:22.101
And if Lisa was here, she'd be
able to tell me what to do.

18:23.823 --> 18:25.827
But I can't ask her.

18:28.511 --> 18:30.514
My husband died too.

18:31.556 --> 18:34.541
It was a...

18:34.641 --> 18:37.485
accident when we were
backpacking in Europe.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.674
It was gonna be
our last vacation

18:42.774 --> 18:43.815
before we started
trying to have a baby.

18:43.895 --> 18:45.899
Sorry.

18:49.224 --> 18:52.209
I moved here to escape
everything about him.

18:52.309 --> 18:54.813
But I...

18:54.913 --> 18:56.496
I still really miss him.

18:56.596 --> 18:58.619
I'm so sorry.

18:58.719 --> 19:00.742
It's life.

19:00.842 --> 19:02.385
Yeah.

19:02.485 --> 19:04.869
It's life. It's...

19:04.969 --> 19:07.753
Oh, life, oh, life,

19:07.853 --> 19:10.978
oh, life, doo, doo-doo, doo.

19:13.022 --> 19:15.025
It's a song.

19:16.347 --> 19:17.809
I'll listen to it.

19:17.909 --> 19:19.652
I need to check it out.

19:19.752 --> 19:22.617
Don't bother.

19:22.717 --> 19:24.961
I find it very easy to be
in your company, you know that?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.548
You made me sing.

19:29.648 --> 19:33.715
I couldn't hold you back.

19:33.815 --> 19:37.240
I'm just not used to being
around people I can talk to.

19:37.340 --> 19:40.085
Yeah, it's been
a while for me too.

19:40.185 --> 19:43.010
Then why did you
run away from me?

19:43.110 --> 19:46.014
I've been asking myself
that question

19:46.114 --> 19:48.118
every day
for the last three weeks.

19:50.882 --> 19:52.705
It was four weeks.

19:52.805 --> 19:54.147
-Sorry, lady.

19:54.247 --> 19:56.551
Thank you.

19:56.651 --> 19:58.154
Come on, kids
we have to get home for dinner.

19:58.254 --> 20:00.257
Thank you!

20:02.380 --> 20:04.324
I just...
I don't want to hurt you.

20:04.424 --> 20:06.487
Or Emma.

20:06.587 --> 20:08.590
I'm sorry.

20:19.447 --> 20:21.731
Keys. My keys. Wait! Mary!

20:28.422 --> 20:30.926
Mary! Mary!

20:31.026 --> 20:33.029
Hey! Hold that cab!

20:35.473 --> 20:38.738
Follow that car!
The jeep with the woman in it.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.383
- You know where it's going?
- No. Just follow the car.

20:41.483 --> 20:43.486
Go. Go, go, go, go.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.520
Hello?

20:52.620 --> 20:54.604
Hey, uh, Sarah,
are you good with Emma still?

20:54.704 --> 20:56.767
Of course we are.
Do you need more time?

20:56.867 --> 20:59.692
Turn, turn. Follow her there.

20:59.792 --> 21:03.538
What's that? Um...
A little. I think.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.821
- Gary, great!
- Is he staying out?

21:05.921 --> 21:07.344
- Good one, Gaz.
- Uh, no. I...

21:07.444 --> 21:10.360
I, uh, I shouldn't be too long.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.072
Take as long as you need to.
We can have her the night
if you need.

21:12.973 --> 21:14.836
- You bet we can.
- Mm-mm. I won't...

21:14.936 --> 21:16.198
I definitely won't
need you to do that.

21:16.298 --> 21:19.403
- She's fine.
- Right. Right, there.

21:19.503 --> 21:21.687
Gary, this is good.

21:21.787 --> 21:24.211
You know Lisa wanted this.

21:24.311 --> 21:25.773
You need to
find yourself again.

21:25.873 --> 21:27.376
We've got your back.

21:27.476 --> 21:29.820
All of us, including Emma.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.142
I know it doesn't
feel like that sometimes,

21:31.242 --> 21:34.427
but she needs you to be happy.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.831
I'll... I'll let you guys know
when I'm on my way back.

21:36.931 --> 21:38.934
OK. Just have fun. Bye.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.084
Mate, you shouldn't
be following women like this.

21:45.184 --> 21:47.187
- It's 2021.
- Just drive the car.

21:57.043 --> 21:59.146
Keep going. Keep going.
Go through the light.

21:59.246 --> 22:01.871
- I'll pay you a little extra.
- No, no.

22:01.971 --> 22:04.074
- What are you doing?
Follow her.
- It's a red light.

22:04.174 --> 22:06.358
What, are we just gonna guess
where she's driving?

22:06.458 --> 22:08.682
- Mate, it's a red light!
- We need to follow that car!

22:08.782 --> 22:10.785
I don't know where she lives.
Oh, my God.

22:12.948 --> 22:14.951
- OK.
- Oh, yay.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.573
That's her.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

22:36.946 --> 22:38.950
Here you go.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.397
Thanks.

22:59.783 --> 23:01.766
Agh!
Did you follow me here?

23:01.866 --> 23:03.930
Why do you have chickens?

23:04.030 --> 23:05.772
No, you need to go, now!

23:05.872 --> 23:06.894
You have my keys.

23:06.994 --> 23:09.178
Oh... Fuck!

23:11.161 --> 23:13.164
Come here...

23:22.946 --> 23:24.046
Come on, here.

23:28.950 --> 23:29.546
Gotcha.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.240
Hey. Uh, what are you doing?

24:13.340 --> 24:15.403
Gary, get the fuck out of here!

24:15.503 --> 24:17.507
You took my keys.

24:17.947 --> 24:20.411
Shit.

24:20.511 --> 24:22.094
Don't come down here.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.763
Is that a goat?

24:32.290 --> 24:34.354
You're just gonna
have to deal with this now!

24:34.454 --> 24:37.498
Hope you're fucking happy,
you fucking dick!

25:12.755 --> 25:14.758
Mary?

25:19.926 --> 25:21.909
