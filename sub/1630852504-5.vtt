WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.803
Hey. Listen,
siu reach out to you yet?

00:04.938 --> 00:05.871
Yeah.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.139
What's that statement
going to say?

00:07.274 --> 00:08.507
Keegan, I wasn't there
when it started.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.308
But if you had walked
in 10 seconds earlier,

00:10.378 --> 00:12.844
You would've seen that
he was coming at me, right?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.479
Are you asking
me to say that?

00:14.548 --> 00:16.181
I want to get into
business with you.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.549
Take my brother out.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.584
If you've got the stones
for that, we'll talk.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.253
Put the gun down, now!

00:21.322 --> 00:22.921
Steph just got pitched.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.090
I pretty much run
stockwood now, don't I?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.424
Going to be my
muscle or not?

00:26.460 --> 00:27.725
Who else is down
there with her?

00:27.762 --> 00:29.561
Oh, it's going to be
another cop or something.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.296
Once we raid sisco's
stash house,

00:31.332 --> 00:33.532
It's going to lead us
straight to the bowens.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.544
Sweetie,
I made you breakfast!

00:45.546 --> 00:47.813
I'm coming.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.347
Here.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.816
Drink this.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.321
It's green.
It tastes like an armpit.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.289
That's the collagen powder,
and then there's just

00:58.325 --> 01:00.125
A tiny bit
of kale in there.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.895
You need greens.
You need proteins.

01:03.964 --> 01:07.565
I am your mother.
It is my job.

01:07.601 --> 01:08.667
You know what?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.236
A mother bird actually
vomits the food

01:11.272 --> 01:12.838
Into the baby
bird's mouth.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.039
Did you know that when
a baby bird gets older

01:14.108 --> 01:16.375
And learns how to fly,
the mama bird stops doing that?

01:16.377 --> 01:18.210
Well, did you know that
a quarter of baby birds die

01:18.345 --> 01:19.511
Because they leave
the nest too early,

01:19.580 --> 01:20.846
Because they think that their
wings are strong enough,

01:20.915 --> 01:22.547
But they are not, because
they didn't have enough kale?

01:22.616 --> 01:25.717
Did you know that if a mama bird
tried to keep a baby bird

01:25.753 --> 01:27.119
In the nest
against its will,

01:27.254 --> 01:29.254
The baby bird would probably
be smothered to death?

01:29.389 --> 01:30.522
Oh, is that so?

01:30.657 --> 01:33.391
Well, I guess this fully
grown baby bird doesn't need

01:33.427 --> 01:35.294
His mama's help and can
get to school himself

01:35.296 --> 01:37.196
Without his new car.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.397
You did not
get me a new car.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.805
No way.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.642
It's the smart car.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.044
Yep.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.679
Cool.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.415
Yeah.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.983
Okay.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.451
Only the best
for my fledgling.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.486
Listen,
it's a fun drive.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.688
Don't worry
about the horn.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.989
It sounds like
a warm fart.

02:05.025 --> 02:05.924
And you know what?

02:06.059 --> 02:07.292
It's fun to park.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.427
I bet.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.896
It's going to attract girls,
just the right kind.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.932
Pack up the kale, please.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.969
You're such a jerk.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.103
No, I'm not.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.772
Yeah, you are.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.709
"morning, mom.
Healthy breakfast? Thanks, mom."

02:23.711 --> 02:24.910
Oh my god.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.645
"roof over my head?
Thanks, mom."

02:26.647 --> 02:28.313
"I got you a new car."
"thanks, mom."

02:28.349 --> 02:31.015
She only got me the car so I'll
be guaranteed to be a loser.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.587
Still could've said
thank you though.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.789
Well, I can get her
back right now.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.191
- No.
- You can say hi.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.392
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

02:40.527 --> 02:41.593
No, I think she forgot
something. Meet her right now.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.928
Elliot, no.
I'm going to be screwed.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.496
What?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.665
Actually, can I just borrow
your car for today?

02:46.734 --> 02:47.733
Tomorrow it's all yours.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.067
Oh, look at that.

02:49.136 --> 02:52.203
Oh, elliot, someone has changed
their mind about breakfast.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.339
Oh, my nose!

02:54.474 --> 02:55.941
I'm so sorry. Here.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.609
- Can you give me my phone?
- Need some ice or something?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.278
My phone.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.412
Here.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.679
Thank you.

03:01.715 --> 03:02.681
I love you, mom.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.683
You're the best
mother bird ever.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.150
I love you, baby bird.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.891
Okay, what the hell?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.760
Why? Why would
you be screwed?

03:23.304 --> 03:25.737
I am her
confidential informant.

03:28.609 --> 03:32.377

03:40.087 --> 03:42.654
- Kelly?
- Door's open.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.127
What are you doing here?

03:49.196 --> 03:51.329
Well, I came to
bring you breakfast.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.464
I'm not going to be
in the office today,

03:52.599 --> 03:55.934
So I figured I'd stop by
and see how you're doing.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.076
Boom.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.877
So how you doing?

04:07.214 --> 04:10.682
Ask me after
I've had three of these.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.819
Go ahead.
You keep your walls up.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.588
Me? I consider you a friend.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.423
I like you, kelly duff.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.958
How about I get
honest, okay?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.432
I'm moving out
of the condo today.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.367
Yeah.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.036
I'm sorry.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.238
Yeah. Thanks.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.240
What are you going to do?
Life, right?

04:35.242 --> 04:38.743
So, what's going
on with you?

04:41.348 --> 04:43.114
I've been talking
to this shrink.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.016
She keeps trying to get me
to talk about what my feelings

04:45.052 --> 04:49.321
Feel like, and I'm like,
I don't even know.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.857
I'm writing
a statement for keegan,

04:52.926 --> 04:54.926
Trying to describe
what I saw that day.

04:54.928 --> 04:58.263
Kelly. You weren't there.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.198
I was there seconds later.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.500
I think, what, that you
feel that you've got to be

05:02.536 --> 05:04.369
Loyal to this guy
or something?

05:04.371 --> 05:05.970
Look, if keegan said
the dude went for his gun,

05:06.040 --> 05:07.806
Then that's what happened.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.207
He's a good guy.

05:09.276 --> 05:12.410
A good guy would not
ask you to lie for him.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.018
It is an excellent day.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.753
I have a little bit of
a nosebleed, everybody.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.356
All is good.
Don't worry about it.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.691
Hey, breann.
What's up?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.226
Good morning,
detective.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.828
I've got some really
good intel for you.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.029
-Been working on it all...
-Can it wait? Hold that thought.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.264
Is detective duff here yet?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.433
Haven't seen her.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.900
Okay. Just where is she?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.542
Oh my god.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.646
What is happening
right now?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.447
I strolled by
drug squad

05:49.483 --> 05:51.383
Praying you would get
a look at me in this outfit,

05:51.518 --> 05:52.918
But you weren't there.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.253
Then I checked my phone,
lo and behold

05:55.255 --> 05:57.255
A text message from you.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.859
So this is how you
spend your free time?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.327
Got to do something to
keep my heart in shape

06:02.329 --> 06:04.930
So you don't break it.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.731
What's up?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.933
Um... Come talk to me.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.670
I could use
your expertise.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.806
Okay. I'm interested.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.074
All right.

06:16.209 --> 06:20.411
So you know that
de angelis case, right?

06:20.447 --> 06:21.813
That I worked with keegan?

06:21.948 --> 06:23.014
Yeah.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.484
Well, we had hidden
cameras in every room,

06:25.619 --> 06:30.421
But a few of those
files got corrupted.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.090
Including the one
tracking keegan's arrest?

06:33.127 --> 06:34.826
I mean, I'm just assuming.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.361
Yeah.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.362
That's convenient.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.365
So what you want me to do?

06:40.500 --> 06:43.034
Do some sniffing around,
see if I can recover something?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.602
Well, but is anyone
going to find out?

06:44.671 --> 06:46.103
I mean, you don't need
a bigger reason

06:46.140 --> 06:47.705
For the bullies
to come prey on you.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.373
I have a thick skin.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.109
[laughs]

06:51.244 --> 06:52.844
Clearly.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.045
I'm going to go charm
the evidence clerk,

06:54.114 --> 06:57.048
Show you what I can do.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.917
Just don't
charm her too much.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.251
Too late now.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.594
-Okay, there she is.
-'sup.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.095
Yes, yes, yes.
Okay, team.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.497
Come together, come together,
come together.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.665
Magazine down. Here we go.
Guess what time it is?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.001
I'm going to tell
you what time it is.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.736
Time to roll up our
sleeves on stockwood.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.938
This is where regular cops
get sleepy, but guess what?

07:20.073 --> 07:21.540
Not us.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.909
Rick gray, steph bowen,
where are they?

07:23.911 --> 07:25.944
Behind bars.
What have we done?

07:26.079 --> 07:29.280
Oh, successfully destabilized
the stockwood crew.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.548
Yes. Yes.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.417
Good cop, good cop, good cop,
good cop, best cop.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.720
Now it's time to get out there
and sweep up the debris.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.989
People will be scared.
People will be talking.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.225
Yeah, but first do you
know you have tissue

07:40.294 --> 07:41.760
Sticking out your nose?

07:41.762 --> 07:42.694
Oh, yeah, I just had, sorry,
I had a nose bleed earlier.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.329
I was just giving it
time to coagulate.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.264
Okay, this is breann.
I've invited her in.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.665
She's been working with
the community outreach

07:47.734 --> 07:49.166
Team in stockwood.

07:49.203 --> 07:50.635
She has a few
nuggets to share.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.836
Yes.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.072
You know, when I was your age,
I too was a keener.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.907
By just three weeks
out of the academy,

07:55.909 --> 07:59.010
I was hand-picked
for a very high profile

07:59.012 --> 08:00.478
Undercover operation.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.480
Cis white male
fast-tracked up the ladder.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.649
No surprise there.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.518
I like you, constable.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.987
We found some extortion
in the fashion industry.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.255
I went undercover
as a male model.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.057
Wow, that's crazy.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.159
Not that crazy.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.360
What's going on
in stockwood?

08:15.362 --> 08:16.461
You know what? Not a lot.

08:16.596 --> 08:17.796
Jackie sullivan hasn't
been in touch much.

08:17.931 --> 08:18.930
I'm going to
reach out to her.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.064
What about randy bowen?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.132
No one's seen hide nor
greasy hair of that guy.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.199
Either he's gone underground

08:22.236 --> 08:23.568
Or someone else
is running stockwood.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.037
Well, I have a few complaints
that might be of interest.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.673
Okay.

08:28.742 --> 08:32.543
Number one, someone who
goes by the name money

08:32.579 --> 08:35.346
Is selling uppers to teenagers
at highland collegiate.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.215
Now, prescription drugs aren't
really a stockwood product,

08:37.217 --> 08:39.951
So I'm thinking
someone new's moving in.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.319
You know what?
I'm going to take that one

08:41.321 --> 08:42.354
Because my son goes there.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.456
Your son goes there,
so you should definitely

08:44.591 --> 08:45.523
Not take that one.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.658
Exactly.

08:46.793 --> 08:47.926
Those kids know me.
They're going to talk to me

08:47.928 --> 08:49.360
Like, "oh, hey. Elliot's mom.
Listen."

08:49.396 --> 08:50.729
I'll be like,
"yeah, that's great. Thank you."

08:50.864 --> 08:52.430
They'll lie to you
and you'll believe them.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.565
Your kid can
talk circles around you.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.733
I've seen it happen.

08:54.735 --> 08:55.967
He doesn't talk
circles around me.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.235
We have a very good line of
communication, actually.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.203
He trusts me, I trust him.
It's wonderful.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.905
He talks circles around
you all the time.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.907
Can we hear what's behind
door number two, please?

09:02.910 --> 09:04.576
Yeah. Yes.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.910
Okay.

09:05.913 --> 09:09.714
Number two, a gun locker
was stolen out of a house

09:09.716 --> 09:13.184
On elmdale three days ago,
two guns missing.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.887
Owner called it in,
but before we could respond,

09:15.889 --> 09:18.123
He called back
and recanted.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.659
Said he found the locker
in the back alley.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.926
What's the name
of the owner?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.828
-James taylor.
-No way.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.529
It's not the singer, barry.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.932
But still,
I mean, stolen guns.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.467
That's not nothing, right?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.002
Why don't we bring him in,
see what he knows?

09:31.038 --> 09:33.004
You know what? In the meantime,
I'm gonna call jackie sullivan,

09:33.006 --> 09:34.405
See if she's heard anything.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.840
Fine.
I'll take money.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.542
You take "fire and rain."

09:37.544 --> 09:39.944
-Thank you, breann. Well done.
-Thank you.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.380
James taylor.
Could you imagine?

09:42.449 --> 09:43.814
It's not james taylor.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.817
It'd be so cool
if it was, right?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.084
Be a bit weird.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.755
Hey. I've got
two bricks in my van.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.556
We're going to take one,
break it down.

09:52.593 --> 09:53.858
No stepping on it.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.559
Roxy, we've got
to keep it clean.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.895
We've got to stay
out of trouble.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.763
That means no selling
to anyone under age.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.198
And hey, no guns.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.233
You hear me?

10:02.235 --> 10:05.603
Okay, but that means we've
got to move more product.

10:05.672 --> 10:06.905
Okay, so we'll
move more product.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.339
Which means we'll need
a better system

10:08.375 --> 10:10.775
Than me breaking stuff down
in an abandoned church.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.710
I can't keep that kind
of weight on site.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.479
Need to be smart
about this.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.646
I'm on it, all right?

10:22.022 --> 10:23.220
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

10:29.563 --> 10:30.795
See?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.430
Driving around with a brick
sitting next to you.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.798
I'm a middle aged
white lady in a minivan.

10:33.933 --> 10:34.966
No one's looking at me.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.410
I never recanted any story.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.278
I said I found my locker.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.579
What about the guns?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.148
The locker was empty
when I found it.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.817
I didn't see any point
in investigating it.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.953
It's not like you guys
are going to find anything.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.154
Detective wazowski.
You own a blue colt .45

10:57.190 --> 10:59.290
And h&k usp .45, correct?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.426
Vanessa let me keep
them after our divorce.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.461
Only nice thing
she ever did.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.363
You live alone?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.031
I do now.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.234
Does anybody have
access to your home?

11:09.369 --> 11:11.335
Workers, friends,
colleagues?

11:11.405 --> 11:13.705
When was your
locker stolen?

11:13.707 --> 11:16.174
About three nights
ago now.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.476
They came in through
the basement door.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.912
It was open
when I came home.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.913
How do you know there
was more than one?

11:23.049 --> 11:24.849
Well, my safe
weighs 200 pounds.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.152
Are you going to carry
that by yourself?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.686
Does pinocchio
have wooden balls?

11:28.755 --> 11:31.022
I can carry that locker
and a two-four of beer.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.190
Okay.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.758
Listen, we're hoping to
have answers for you soon.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.527
Forensics are running prints
on the safe as we speak.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.261
Look, what's the point?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.664
I mean, the guns
are long gone by now.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.333
Sir, are you trying
to get us off this case?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.068
No, sir.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.204
But when you cops come
around my neighborhood,

11:46.206 --> 11:48.339
It always means trouble.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.810
We've got enough of
that to go around.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.212
Do you play
guitar by chance?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.280
Hamm, don't.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.347
What? I just have to-

11:56.383 --> 11:57.749
He doesn't.

11:57.751 --> 11:58.949
Harmonica?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.097
Elliot.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.033
Can you just talk to me?

12:16.035 --> 12:18.303
There's a party later
at the old church.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.838
Do you want to come
meet some of my friends?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.307
Do you have friends,
because I bet being a snitch

12:22.442 --> 12:23.908
Would be pretty
tough on friendships.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.244
Hey, I don't snitch
on my friends.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.478
Right.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.314
Okay, so maybe you just
snitch on me then?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.048
What did my mom put you on
to me so she can watch

12:31.050 --> 12:32.183
My every move or something?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.051
You're being
ridiculous, elliot.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.854
I know you didn't just
meet me by coincidence.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.589
You're my mom's informant.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.223
I know enough to know
that means

12:39.292 --> 12:41.058
You're some sort of
criminal or something.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.197
So what, you just ran into me
and you forced yourself

12:46.233 --> 12:47.665
Into my life or something?

12:47.801 --> 12:50.268
I didn't force
myself onto anyone.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.502
Okay?

12:51.505 --> 12:53.905
And I never said
it was a coincidence.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.673
What?

12:55.742 --> 12:59.076
Okay, elliot.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.613
Yes, I was with your mom
when she called about

13:01.748 --> 13:03.147
The late bloomer sale.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.949
I was curious
about you, okay?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.084
And your mom, I'm so sorry,
she's such a dork,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.387
And you're just not at all
what I was expecting.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.457
And elliot, I didn't expect
to hit it off with you,

13:12.592 --> 13:15.260
But we did.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.961
Like, how am I supposed to
believe anything you say?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.101
I thought that
you saw me.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.304
What?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.506
I thought that
you saw me.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.974
I don't know how
I got it so wrong.

13:30.109 --> 13:33.077
Hey, jackie. Hey, jackie.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.450
Hey, elliot. How you doing?

13:39.452 --> 13:40.818
Remember me?

13:53.567 --> 13:55.333
Hey, tig.
What are you doing here?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.235
I thought you were
still in buffalo.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.737
Yeah, um.
The border went really fast.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.073
I made good time.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.075
Okay.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.277
I've got some leftover goulash
and some homemade bu--

14:06.279 --> 14:08.913
Hi, sis.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.015
You slept with him?

14:11.017 --> 14:13.551
Layna, are you
sick in the head?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.420
You drove straight from buffalo
right into this idiot's bed?

14:16.456 --> 14:17.655
Of course not.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.892
I went by the garage
and dropped off the drugs first.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.893
Oh, come on.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.328
He's got a jacuzzi.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.630
And that chair.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.965
And that table.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.966
You know what? My sister
deserves way better than you.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.834
She has serious
low self-esteem.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.503
-Tig.
-Who doesn't?

14:32.505 --> 14:34.605
Did you at least
get mercedes her food

14:34.608 --> 14:36.541
After all these insults.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.442
Good.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.712
Frozen? Oh, come on.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.348
Mercedes prefers fresh.
She's refined.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.016
Then get a cat
to do your shopping.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.418
Well, you try eating
a frozen rat.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.121
Buffalo just
fronted us ten keys.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.590
That's 200,000
worth of product.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.325
Your guys are going to
have to pick up the pace

14:54.460 --> 14:56.060
If we're going to sell
it all and pay him back.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.796
I want to move more,
I want to play it safer.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.865
You got anyone that
could kit up my car?

15:00.867 --> 15:01.865
You know, build
a compartment?

15:01.902 --> 15:03.201
Yeah, I know a guy.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.669
Good, because we need
a better distribution plan, too.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.671
We can't keep working
out of my garage.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.805
We could do it here.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.974
No. Too much foot traffic.
We'd get flagged.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.343
We've gotta find a business that
hires a lot of young people,

15:12.478 --> 15:14.278
In and out,
lots of turnover

15:14.314 --> 15:17.281
Like a store
or a fast food place.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.616
I know another guy.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.885
His car wash could
use a cash injection.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.087
Okay. You trust him?

15:23.156 --> 15:25.156
No, I don't trust anybody.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.824
Oh. That's funny.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.426
Neither do I.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.227
Except each other, right?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.563
Because we're
a family now.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.565
Okay, you're disgusting.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.100
Elliot: Okay, I will do
literally anything to stop you

15:36.136 --> 15:37.301
From telling my
mom about this.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.303
Kelly: No, man.
She needs to know.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.438
Why?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.739
Why?

15:41.741 --> 15:44.709
Jackie sullivan is your mom's
confidential informant.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.444
Anybody finds out you
guys have been talking,

15:46.446 --> 15:47.978
It'll ruin her career.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.246
No. She didn't know.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.581
It doesn't matter.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.083
It'll put extra scrutiny
on her cases.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.918
I didn't even know
until like two hours ago,

15:54.053 --> 15:57.789
And we just broke up anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.858
You tell her or I do.

16:00.860 --> 16:01.992
Right now?

16:02.028 --> 16:03.394
Yeah.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.996
Right after you tell me
who the hell this money is.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.998
Apparently he's dealing
uppers for the kids

16:07.133 --> 16:08.132
At your school?

16:08.168 --> 16:09.266
Yeah. My friends buy
from him all the time.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.468
He sells out
of a food truck.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.336
He drives around
to all the schools.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.739
Look, I'll tell you where
the truck's due next

16:14.874 --> 16:16.774
If you promise not to tell
my mom about jackie.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.011
All right.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.413
You help me with this,
I'll give you to the end

16:22.548 --> 16:23.747
Of her shift tonight.

16:23.883 --> 16:24.949
She's going to
be exhausted.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.384
You've got to give me
at least 24 hours.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.919
Final offer.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.620
Fine.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.288
All right.
Now, where am I headed?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.956
He'll be here in 30.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.692
He'll be ...

16:34.827 --> 16:36.627
What?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.963
Oh, now I'm starting to see
why your mom doesn't know

16:38.965 --> 16:41.799
Which way
is up with you.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.301
Witness reports.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.369
A comely neighbor saw
two medium sized figures

16:45.438 --> 16:47.438
Carrying the locker
out of the basement.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.640
Did this fully empowered
human being happen

16:49.642 --> 16:50.841
To give a description?

16:50.910 --> 16:53.177
No, it was too dark,
but one of them had a limp

16:53.246 --> 16:54.479
And the other a crowbar.

16:54.614 --> 16:55.980
The gun locker
was banged up, yes,

16:56.115 --> 16:57.248
But that's not how they got in.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.182
They used a keypad.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.450
Okay.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.918
Forensic pulled
two sets of prints.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.653
One belonged to james taylor,
which is no surprise,

17:02.789 --> 17:05.355
And the other one was unknown
until about 10 minutes ago.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.925
Alina taylor,
james' daughter.

17:07.927 --> 17:09.593
He didn't say
he had a kid.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.462
She lives with her mother.
It was a nasty divorce.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.064
Apparently, this is when
she started acting out.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.698
She got arrested for
shoplifting last year.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.334
It might be why james
recanted his story.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.002
Maybe he finds out
his 17-year-old daughter

17:18.004 --> 17:19.870
Stole his guns,
doesn't want her to go to jail.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.141
So why would alina
steal the locker

17:23.276 --> 17:25.476
If she could just open it?

17:25.612 --> 17:28.145
Because then it wouldn't
look like a robbery.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.748
You're welcome.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.217
Thank you.

17:33.253 --> 17:37.354
So you guys think
my kid did it, huh?

17:37.356 --> 17:39.490
Honest to god,
you guys are just ...

17:39.625 --> 17:42.560
You neglected to tell us
you even had a daughter.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.228
James:
Alina lives with her mother,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.497
Which wasn't my choice
by the way.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.732
Anyway, she wasn't even
at my house the night

17:48.802 --> 17:50.168
That the locker was stolen.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.970
It's true. I was with
like six friends that night.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.738
And they can
vouch for you?

17:59.612 --> 18:01.078
Mr. Taylor,
can I have the combination

18:01.081 --> 18:02.480
To your gun locker?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.648
Why don't you just
write it down for me?

18:14.994 --> 18:16.594
If you wouldn't mind,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.629
I'd like to talk to
your daughter alone.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.931
-No way.
-No way. I'm staying.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.499
I'm sure you two have
a lot to discuss.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.467
Barry's an expert
in divorce.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.103
Women have married this
guy like three times.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.109
All right, mr. Taylor.
Do you want to come with me?

18:38.217 --> 18:40.952
I am curious, have
you seen fire and rain?

18:41.087 --> 18:44.088
Do I really have to
go with this guy?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.492
Divorce sucks,
doesn't it?

18:48.495 --> 18:51.395
I don't know.
I'm not divorced.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.330
Kids always get
stuck in the middle.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.966
My son, he had
a really rough time.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.801
Did you have to
choose sides?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.573
My father was happy.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.243
My mother was sad.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.179
Made it easy.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.647
Do you remember
when they told you?

19:09.782 --> 19:12.583
For me, that was really
the hardest part.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.319
Just having
to tell my kid.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.722
They told me the day
it was official.

19:17.724 --> 19:21.258
A year ago, June 6th.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.995
Obviously that was a really
big day for your family,

19:23.997 --> 19:26.797
Especially your dad,

19:26.933 --> 19:29.132
Because that's the combination
to his gun locker,

19:29.169 --> 19:31.034
The one that we found
your fingerprints on.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.072
Listen, I don't you think
you stole the locker

19:35.074 --> 19:37.074
With the guns in it,
but you need to tell me

19:37.143 --> 19:38.376
Why you opened it.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.044
I just wanted
to look at them.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.885
I had a friend over.

19:47.954 --> 19:52.089
I thought it would
be cool to show her.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.724
What's the name
of that friend?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.426
Roxy.

19:57.864 --> 19:58.763
Mm-hmm.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.230
Roxy morales.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.099
Did she watch you
punch in the code?

20:05.238 --> 20:08.039
Okay, do you
have her number?

20:08.174 --> 20:10.240
Okay, has she been
in touch since?

20:12.778 --> 20:14.378
She said she'd call.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.047
She didn't.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.585
I heard she was having
people over tonight

20:21.588 --> 20:24.254
At the old church
she was living in.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.723
I was going to go.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.191
You know what?

20:27.193 --> 20:29.593
Tell you what, you're
going to go to this party.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.595
You take some videos.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.864
You post these videos.
You show me roxy.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.599
Hey, jacks.
What's going on?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.103
Can I come in?

21:24.183 --> 21:26.717
What time are people
coming over tonight?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.319
I don't know,
probably 9:00 or so.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.654
Cool.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.822
I've got to do something
first but forrest will be here.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.358
Do you mind if I just stay
here for a little bit?

21:34.360 --> 21:36.994
I just got dumped.
I don't feel like going home.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.863
What happened?

21:43.136 --> 21:45.736
I told him the truth
about something.

21:48.508 --> 21:49.807
And he didn't like it.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.284
Are you working
for mom, roxy?

22:00.286 --> 22:02.619
I need the money,
all right?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.088
I can't spend another
broke ass winter.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.823
-It's freezing.
-Then get a job.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.457
That's rich
coming from you.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.660
[phone buzzes]

22:12.631 --> 22:13.764
I got to go.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.366
-Where are you going?
-You don't want to know.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.034
Yep, I do.
And I'm coming with you.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.235
I don't want to be
alone right now.

22:18.271 --> 22:19.303
No, your mom will kill me.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.038
No, screw my mom.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.445
Roxanna morales,
also known as roxy.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.112
Last known address
was a po box.

22:29.114 --> 22:30.614
What do we got?

22:30.650 --> 22:33.450
Uh, a couple of theft unders,
did a stint in a youth center

22:33.519 --> 22:34.852
For armed robbery.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.119
No current charges.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.521
Okay. Any connection
with stockwood?

22:37.656 --> 22:40.124
Nothing, besides the fact
that she grew up there.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.693
Okay. No known address.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.329
Okay. Maybe she's broke,
stole the guns to sell them.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.997
A blue colt will fetch
you a pretty penny.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.465
Okay, you know what?
Let's find this roxy.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.867
We're going to get
her for the guns.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.001
Maybe she has some
intel on stockwood.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.169
Yes.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.670
Kids these days.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.706
Elliot: I mean, you work with
her, you know what it's like.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.641
She starts off by stating the
obvious in way too many words.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.343
"and so now you're going
to crush geometry

22:59.478 --> 23:00.911
Using my meticulous
five point plan.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.246
How was your day,
by the way?"

23:02.315 --> 23:03.714
Then it's like you don't answer
and she starts to hover.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.615
It's like, "will you just
tell me what happened?

23:05.651 --> 23:06.884
Why don't we
just talk it out?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.752
Do you like science or art?
Both are great.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.021
Do you like girls or boys?
Both are also great.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.622
Why don't you just tell me
everything you're feeling

23:12.658 --> 23:14.358
While I turn on music
and brush your teeth for you?"

23:14.493 --> 23:16.493
Oh, she's not that bad.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.429
Trust me, she is.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.264
It sounds like she
cares about you.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.634
When you love someone,
it's different, right?

23:23.769 --> 23:26.803
You lose objectivity.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.440
Well, I objectively know
that my mother's annoying.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.643
I don't know why jackie
would want to be her ci.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.312
No one chooses
to be a ci.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.581
It's a lesser
evil scenario.

23:37.716 --> 23:38.782
I mean, they don't
have a choice.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.784
Once you've got them
on the hook as a snitch,

23:40.787 --> 23:42.586
You own them.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.258
Oh, please.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.726
Don't have any pity
for that girl.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.394
She made her bed.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.530
You just said she didn't
have a choice, so.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.631
That's it.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.901
-Hold up.
-Hang tight.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.069
Wait, money's not going
to sell to you.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.037
Why not?

24:00.172 --> 24:01.672
-Because you're old.
-What?

24:01.741 --> 24:03.907
And you need a code word.
I need to get it in person.

24:03.943 --> 24:08.479
Well, go get the code and come
straight back here, okay?

24:08.548 --> 24:09.813
Yeah.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.248
I'll pull a uc to
do the actual buy.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.582
All right.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.589
Calling me old.
I ain't old.

24:38.377 --> 24:39.509
Is...

24:42.648 --> 24:44.648
Oh, hell no.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.183
Kill that kid.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.024
Dude, you were only
supposed to go get the code.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.461
I thought I'd move
things along, okay?

24:57.530 --> 24:59.830
Buy myself some time before
you rat me out to my mom.

24:59.832 --> 25:00.831
Just...

25:04.236 --> 25:05.201
Whoa.

25:05.238 --> 25:07.071
Just give me another day.
Please.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.313
Wait, I don't know what ...

25:16.448 --> 25:17.481
Hey, I don't know what
to say to her yet.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.182
I need another day. Please.

25:19.252 --> 25:22.619
Is that money?
Stay right there.

25:22.655 --> 25:25.556
Whoa, whoa, no you don't.
Police! You're under arrest!

25:25.691 --> 25:28.225
-Okay. Yeah, yeah.
-Get down.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.693
What'd I do?

25:29.762 --> 25:30.961
Hands behind your back.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.363
Stand all the way up, now!

25:32.498 --> 25:33.630
Okay. Okay.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.965
What did you do?

25:34.967 --> 25:37.901
You sold controlled substances
to numerous minors.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.237
Plus, you ruined
my love of burritos.

25:41.407 --> 25:42.706
Huh?

25:42.775 --> 25:44.174
You should've
stuck to limericks.

25:44.176 --> 25:47.311
Actually, the lime rick,
no limericks involved.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.313
The decal guy forgot to put
a space between the lime

25:49.382 --> 25:52.783
And the rick, and now
I've got to deal irish burritos.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.117
It makes no sense.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.986
Do you think I care about
your design problems?

25:59.258 --> 26:03.193
Punk ass kid. Come on.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.530
Hey.

26:07.567 --> 26:10.267
You know, if you need
a place to stay ...

26:11.837 --> 26:13.737
You can stay with us, girl.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.340
You don't have to sell
drugs for my mother.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.143
I don't take
handouts, jackie.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.677
I've got to hustle.
Don't worry about me.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.948
Anyway, tiggy's
like another mother.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.818
She's better
than my mother.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.353
My mother's hopeless.

26:29.355 --> 26:33.290
My mother
is an asshole.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.759
No. Your mom is tough.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.361
Unlike her kid.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.828
-Huh.
-Boohoo.

26:38.864 --> 26:40.898
Got in a fight
with a boy.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.733
Boys are the worst, man.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.570
God, you're so lucky
that you like women.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.741
Whoa. What?
What are you doing?

26:51.777 --> 26:53.043
Forrest and I
stole some guns.

26:53.178 --> 26:54.378
I'm going to offload them
on these tech guys

26:54.513 --> 26:56.113
I met on the web.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.315
Stay here, okay?

27:04.223 --> 27:06.556
-'sup?
-Hey.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.862
-Here it is.
-Is that real?

27:11.997 --> 27:13.731
Of course it's real.
What are you talking about?

27:13.733 --> 27:15.933
Here you go.
It's all there.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.401
-No, man. Where's the rest?
-That's all.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.836
Give me the rest, man.
What the hell?

27:19.838 --> 27:20.904
It's time to go.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.340
Oh my god, roxy.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.078
[screams]

27:28.080 --> 27:29.346

Hey. You hit?

27:29.348 --> 27:32.883
Dude? Dude?

27:34.086 --> 27:35.953
Buyer:
Get back here!

27:35.955 --> 27:37.421
Get back here, you psycho!

Ce music]

27:57.777 --> 27:58.909
Roxy.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.176
Hey, roxy.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.912
What if that guy is dead?

28:01.914 --> 28:03.847
Stop freaking out.
Forrest is here somewhere.

28:03.982 --> 28:05.582
Maybe he's upstairs.

28:05.584 --> 28:07.851
If those youths hit back,
I want numbers.

28:07.986 --> 28:09.386
Wait, you mean you think
they're coming here?

28:09.388 --> 28:10.987
You think they're
coming here?

28:10.989 --> 28:12.189
Yes.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.791
Put your phone away.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.660
Just stay here until
I find forrest, okay?

28:16.662 --> 28:18.995
Jackie, you've got to chill.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.336
Elliot, look.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.505
I am done playing with you,
and I don't have time

28:28.541 --> 28:31.074
To chase you right now,
so you need to call me back

28:31.143 --> 28:34.411
And tell me where
you are right now.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.613
Oh, and whatever you do,
do not take those drugs.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.615
They're evidence.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.684
Call me back.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.821
Hey, what's up, wazowski?

28:44.857 --> 28:46.557
You talk to your son
tonight by any chance?

28:46.692 --> 28:49.126
Elliot? No. Why? Oh, is it
that highland collegiate thing?

28:49.195 --> 28:51.562
Is he involved? Is he on drugs?
Oh my god, wait.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.163
Is he in trouble?
Is he in trouble?

28:53.199 --> 28:56.633
-Calm down.
-Is he in trouble.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.168
Look, your kid
is still a nerd

28:58.303 --> 29:00.304
Dressed in cool
kid's clothes, okay?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.772
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.341
That's, like, every mother's
dream but why are you asking?

29:04.410 --> 29:06.977
No, I was just thinking
about teenagers, you know?

29:07.046 --> 29:08.945
Why they do what they do.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.181
Speaking of teens,
have you ever heard

29:11.217 --> 29:13.116
Of a roxanna morales?

29:13.185 --> 29:15.786
Roxy. I've seen her around.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.654
She lives in that
old church in stockwood.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.656
Rough life.

29:19.791 --> 29:22.259
Yeah, well, it's about
to get even rougher.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.427
Check this out.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.396
Whose feed is that?

29:26.398 --> 29:27.997
This girl, alina taylor.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.200
It was her father's
gun locker that was stolen,

29:30.269 --> 29:33.203
And we think roxy
was involved.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.071
Is that jackie sullivan?

29:35.073 --> 29:36.506
Yes, it is.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.741
Of course, it is.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.733
Hey. Forrest, where's roxy?

30:02.868 --> 30:04.668
-What?
-She was supposed to call me.

30:04.670 --> 30:09.573
The party's at roxy's church.
Maybe we should head over.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.576
Hey, look at this.
Make it go back.

30:12.711 --> 30:13.776
Oh, yeah.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.913
Hey. Forrest, where's roxy?

30:15.915 --> 30:18.348
-What?
-She was supposed to call me.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.118
Check out limpy tits here.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.786
The other locker
thief had a limp.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.721
He's possibly armed
and possibly dangerous.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.256
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.724
You need backup?

30:27.860 --> 30:29.993
Admit it,
you missed me.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.796
You did. It's okay.
I missed you, too.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.798
Weirdly, I feel like
I've been with you all day.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.755
Hungry? Why?
Where's jackie?

30:58.757 --> 30:59.890
Jackie?

30:59.892 --> 31:01.625

Hi. Mom, I'm at roxy's,
and there's trouble.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.084
Yeah, because you're hanging
around at that church.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.186
Whatever's going on right now,
you get your ass home now.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.454
You hear me?

31:30.589 --> 31:32.055
Jackie?

31:34.260 --> 31:36.192
I'll go in there first,
suss it out.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.195
Not going to lie, I'll
stick out like a sore thumb,

31:38.330 --> 31:39.729

31:39.798 --> 31:42.198

clown faces painted on them.

Look at those clean little
white shoes, little yellow vest.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.838

stick out at all.

Hey, hey.

34:27.165 --> 34:28.298
That's my son.

34:28.433 --> 34:30.534
Breann,
that's my son.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.040
Okay, mom, just let me
explain for a second, okay?

34:37.042 --> 34:38.508
I don't know
whose that is.

34:38.643 --> 34:39.842
I don't know what it is.

34:39.844 --> 34:40.811
It's not even mine.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.378
I don't even know how
that got there.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.447
Look, just ...

34:44.450 --> 34:46.049
Put your hands
behind your back.

34:49.121 --> 34:50.520
Put your hands
behind your back.

Sam.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.125
Mom.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.197
Take him.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.753
Hey.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.556
So we got three
guys in custody?

35:26.592 --> 35:28.091
Yeah.
Roxy's in the hospital.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.427
Shooter's in custody,
plus four more kids

35:30.429 --> 35:31.427
For possession.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.696
Okay.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.764
Do we know
the shooter's affiliation?

35:34.766 --> 35:37.000
He's not talking,
and he has no priors.

35:37.069 --> 35:39.870
We're going to talk to roxy
when she's out of surgery.

35:40.005 --> 35:42.305
Okay.

35:42.374 --> 35:46.910
Hey, uh... Where's elliot?

35:47.045 --> 35:51.013
Uh, he's in holding.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.318
Duff,

36:02.027 --> 36:03.726
What were you talking
to my son about

36:03.795 --> 36:06.496
Before the shooting?

36:06.498 --> 36:08.398
I saw you yelling
at my kid.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.002
I ran into him today.

36:12.137 --> 36:14.270
I was looking for that
dealer at highland collegiate.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.006
Elliot was outside
the school.

36:16.141 --> 36:19.342
He offered to help.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.947
Are you saying that you
used my kid in a case today,

36:23.949 --> 36:27.016
And that's why
he had drugs on him?

36:27.052 --> 36:29.286
Is this... Is that what
you're saying to me?

36:29.288 --> 36:32.088
I'm saying there's so much
more to this story, sam.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.690
Is that what you
and keegan used to do?

36:33.759 --> 36:34.757
That's what you
like to do?

36:34.826 --> 36:36.226
You pimp out kids to
do your police work?

36:36.295 --> 36:39.729
No wonder you back him up.
You're no better than him.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.264
Okay, I'm going to
let that one slide.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.566
Yeah? You're going to
let that one slide?

36:43.602 --> 36:45.701
You need to talk
to your son.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.937
Don't you tell me what
I need to do with my son.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.809
That's my son.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.385
You're an asshole.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.634
Hey.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.938
Congratulations, elliot.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.540
Truly though, really.
Well done.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.141
You've been arrested
for possession.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.146
What the hell were you
doing at that party?

37:33.552 --> 37:35.151
Hey, elliot, I'm not leaving
till I get an answer.

37:36.521 --> 37:37.953
Okay.

37:37.990 --> 37:40.890
What if I just tell you
every bad thing I've ever done?

37:40.892 --> 37:42.425
Every single
terrible thing.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.660
If I just tell you every
single terrible thing,

37:43.729 --> 37:45.695
Can we just clean the slate

37:45.697 --> 37:47.831
And you just promise
not to freak out?

37:47.833 --> 37:51.301
Yeah. I've got nothing
else to lose. Okay, yes.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.170
-Yeah?
-Yes, go. Hit me.

37:54.172 --> 37:57.107
Okay. Your credit card
wasn't stolen last year.

37:57.242 --> 38:00.676
I was using it to buy
clothes to sell online.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.580
That time mike's house got
broken into, that was me.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.580
I just wanted
to borrow a video game,

38:04.616 --> 38:05.848
And I didn't want
to wait for him,

38:05.884 --> 38:07.050
So I just kicked
his back door in.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.117
Oh, wow.

38:08.252 --> 38:09.185
You said you
wouldn't get mad.

38:09.187 --> 38:12.655
I just... I was...
I was breathing heavily.

38:12.657 --> 38:15.458
Oh, when we got bed bugs,
I think it was because

38:15.527 --> 38:17.327
I let rahim and his
boyfriend sleep

38:17.329 --> 38:18.895
In your bed when
you were on night shift.

38:18.897 --> 38:19.896
When we went
away last christmas,

38:20.031 --> 38:22.064
I rented our house out
as an airbnb,

38:22.066 --> 38:23.800
And that's why the plumbing was
all messed up when we got back,

38:23.802 --> 38:27.604
And I got a fake id to date
a ta at ryerson last year.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.272
Oh my god. Please stop.
I can't.

38:29.407 --> 38:30.473
Elliot, I can't.

38:30.542 --> 38:34.010
Please, just skip to tonight.
What happened?

38:34.012 --> 38:35.812
Yeah.

38:35.881 --> 38:39.616
I was helping kelly
with a bust,

38:39.618 --> 38:42.686
And I just left
with the drugs.

38:42.821 --> 38:47.423
And I was at that party
because I wanted to talk to jay.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.491
Who's jay?

38:51.596 --> 38:53.596
Her name's
jackie sullivan.

38:53.598 --> 38:57.233
It's your confidential
informant or whatever.

38:57.235 --> 39:00.103
But I didn't know, okay?

39:00.105 --> 39:02.638
Kelly saw us together,
and she said I had to tell you,

39:02.640 --> 39:04.307
And then I was trying
to get out of doing that,

39:04.376 --> 39:06.776
So then I forced her to let
me help, and I was just...

39:06.778 --> 39:08.711
Elliot,

39:08.713 --> 39:12.181
You can never
see her again.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.117
-What?
-No.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.685
Mom, she's not a bad person
or anything, okay?

39:19.191 --> 39:20.690
You just have to trust me.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.695
