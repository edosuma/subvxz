00:05.139 --> 00:07.239
(mysterious music)

00:50.184 --> 00:51.950
(inaudible conversation)

00:52.753 --> 00:54.286
(glass clinking)

00:54.288 --> 00:56.355
(carnival music)

00:57.424 --> 00:59.458
(indistinct chatter)

01:05.799 --> 01:07.099
- What a lovely fair.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.434
- Yes. We should hurry along,
though, william.

01:09.536 --> 01:10.969
I do need to get back
to the hospital

01:10.971 --> 01:12.504
And then meet
with the new nanny.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.906
- Make sure she's a tough nut.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.108
Need someone to protect
little susannah.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.111
- True enough, but I intend
to do anything and everything

01:19.113 --> 01:22.381
To ensure that no danger
ever befalls her again.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.183
- This is a special time
to be a parent, doctor.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.653
I remember taking my lads
to fairs like this.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.521
- I'm sure you're right.
It's just hard to appreciate

01:29.523 --> 01:31.256
The moment when one has
a thousand different

01:31.358 --> 01:32.591
Things to do.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.993
I scarcely have a moment alone
with my thoughts these days.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.328
- Miss hart! Oh! Miss hart.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.664
A few questions.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.999
Do you have any contact
with the carmichael family?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.066
Have you seen them?

01:42.069 --> 01:43.335
- I really don't have
anything to say.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.604
- Oh, were you invited
to arthur carmichael's funeral?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.072
Or are they still
looking for his body?

01:47.174 --> 01:49.575
- Oi! That's enough.
Leave the lady alone.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.677
- Move along.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.612
- Everywhere I go.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.949
- It will pass in time,
miss hart.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.617
- Surely do hope so.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.321
- Oh, william, look at this.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.691
- "your wish made true."

02:06.694 --> 02:08.560
(brackenreid): Sounds like
a bit of fun.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.096
- Fun has nothing to do with it.

02:11.198 --> 02:14.233
The mechanical man
has special powers.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.969
- Oh! An automaton.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.971
- He will grant you one wish.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.641
But be careful
what you wish for.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.442
- Right, then.
How much is it?

02:24.444 --> 02:25.376
I could use a wish.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.980
- Well, it's free
of charge, sir.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.781
But a word of caution:

02:29.783 --> 02:33.252
Your wish will surely come true.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.821
- That's a good yorkshire price.
(laughing)

02:35.923 --> 02:37.589
- I wouldn't mind having a go.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.591
- I don't know.
It sounds silly to me.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.660
- Oh come on, william.
It's just a bit of fun.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.662
We'll make it quick.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.532
- You must approach
the man one at a time.

02:47.767 --> 02:51.203
Place your hand
on the crystal ball...

02:52.872 --> 02:54.206
And wish.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.409
(snorts)

02:57.510 --> 02:59.178
(mysterious music)

03:01.949 --> 03:03.615
(chuckling)

03:09.189 --> 03:10.622
(zapping)

03:10.624 --> 03:13.291
- I wish I could leave
all responsibilities behind.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.493
(chuckling)

03:14.595 --> 03:16.762
(eerie music)

03:16.764 --> 03:20.299
- I wish that I could blend in
just like everyone else.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.170
- I wish that the city
could be rid of vermin.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.207
- I wish...

03:29.409 --> 03:33.579
That I never put
susannah in danger again.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.385
<i> (mechanical voice):</i>
<i> Your wish made true.</i>

03:43.390 --> 03:45.123
(indistinct chatter)

03:47.094 --> 03:50.095
- So, do you think
your wish will come true?

03:50.196 --> 03:52.264
- Oh, time will tell.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.398
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.801
- Oh, your wishes
will come true,

03:56.804 --> 03:58.336
Every word.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.272
Isn't that right?

04:01.208 --> 04:03.875
<i> - Your wish made true.</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:06.878
- Everyone's wish comes true.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.450
<i> - Your wish made true.</i>

04:13.354 --> 04:14.753
(choking)

04:21.295 --> 04:23.362
(mechanical laughter)

04:27.400 --> 04:29.701
<i> - Your wish made true.</i>

04:29.803 --> 04:32.237
(mechanical laughter)

04:41.715 --> 04:44.583
- Everyone wants
a peaceful life.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.851
The chance of solitude,

04:46.953 --> 04:49.588
No interruptions,
no distractions.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.991
It sounds like a dream.

04:52.993 --> 04:57.496
But sometimes,
dreams turn into nightmares.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.166
(sinister music)

05:06.940 --> 05:09.607
- That's everything
I could find around here.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.143
- Thank you, violet.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.345
Sorry it's taken me so long
to clear all my things.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.080
- Oh, not to worry.
Much of these supplies

05:15.181 --> 05:16.815
Are yours.
Without what you brought,

05:16.917 --> 05:18.817
The shelves would be empty.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.285
- Well, I should be going.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.087
Between my marriage and my job
and my child,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.757
I scarcely have time
to breathe anymore.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.459
- Where's all this going?

05:27.561 --> 05:28.493
- Oh, the women's clinic.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.829
The place could use
a little personality.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.298
- Oh! There is one more thing.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.902
- Ah.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.037
I'd almost forgotten
about this.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.171
- Whose brain is it?

05:40.174 --> 05:42.407
(thunder rumbling)
- he was a murderer.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.643
He was hanged: James gillies.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.778
- And you've kept his brain?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.646
- I thought it would be
worth studying,

05:48.649 --> 05:50.882
But I haven't
found the time.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.821
(thunder cracking)

05:57.558 --> 05:59.057
(zapping)

06:01.761 --> 06:03.028
(man whispering): Julia.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.936
Julia.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.940
(suspenseful music)

06:28.755 --> 06:29.921
(thunder rumbling)

06:30.023 --> 06:31.889
(lightbulb zapping)

06:31.892 --> 06:33.225
Julia?

06:36.029 --> 06:37.195
- Hello?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.036
Oh!

06:45.038 --> 06:47.038
(julia sighs)
mathilda.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.840
I didn't realize
anyone else was here.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.142
- Oh, I'm headed home.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.977
Just finishing cleaning up
a few last things.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.447
- Well, good.
I'll see you tomorrow, then?

06:55.548 --> 06:57.616
- See you tomorrow.
- All right.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.718
(thunder rumbling)

06:59.720 --> 07:00.919
(sighs)

07:01.488 --> 07:03.722
(phone ringing)

07:05.792 --> 07:07.192
Hello?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.727
Oh, william.
Yes, I'm still at the office,

07:09.730 --> 07:10.995
But I'm heading home soon.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.465
Yes, I will make it
home for supper, I promise.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.134
(chuckles)
see you soon.

07:18.805 --> 07:20.071
(man): Julia.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.142
- Mathilda?

07:24.244 --> 07:26.945
(suspenseful music)

07:30.817 --> 07:32.451
(thunder rumbling)

07:32.552 --> 07:34.085
Mathilda?

07:37.224 --> 07:38.323
Mathilda?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.863
(♪♪)

07:50.237 --> 07:51.269
Mathilda?

07:52.506 --> 07:53.972
(thunder cracking)

07:55.309 --> 07:56.574
No.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.577
(gasps)
no...

07:59.812 --> 08:01.345
That's impossible.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.882
You're dead. You can't be here.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.618
What is happening?!?

08:08.121 --> 08:09.621
- I came to see you, of course.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.724
- What have you done
with mathilda?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.059
- You don't need to worry
about her anymore.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.395
- No. No, no,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.064
Stay away from here.
Leave me alone!

08:19.165 --> 08:20.732
- I can't do that.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.935
You understand
why I came back here,

08:23.937 --> 08:25.303
Don't you, julia?

08:26.473 --> 08:28.673
Because I'm not
done with you yet.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.675
- You're dead!

08:31.578 --> 08:34.679
- Oh. You knew I would return.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.948
And now that I'm here,

08:37.050 --> 08:40.151
Oh, I am going to enjoy it.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.554
(tense music)

08:42.556 --> 08:43.922
(shouts)

08:45.258 --> 08:46.758
(blood trickling)

08:49.329 --> 08:50.295
- Julia!

08:51.464 --> 08:53.631
Julia, what have you done?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.000
(gasping)

08:56.937 --> 08:59.037
(choking)

08:59.139 --> 09:00.305
- Mathilda?

09:01.007 --> 09:02.474
Mathilda!

09:04.477 --> 09:06.444
(panting)

09:07.381 --> 09:09.447
(♪♪)

09:16.956 --> 09:18.456
Murdoch residence, please.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.824
<i>(operator): One moment, please.</i>

09:20.961 --> 09:22.928
(ringing tone)

09:23.029 --> 09:24.129
- Answer...

09:24.230 --> 09:26.498
Please, william, answer!

09:27.867 --> 09:29.467
<i> - There's no answer, ma'am.</i>

09:29.569 --> 09:32.270
- Oh! Ah, um...

09:32.372 --> 09:35.540
Uh... Please, um...

09:35.542 --> 09:37.242
<i> - Ma'am, are you all right?</i>

09:38.044 --> 09:39.544
<i> Do you need a doctor?</i>

09:39.646 --> 09:43.014
- Uh, no. Um, the crabtree
residence, please.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.783
Connect me to
the crabtree residence.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.018
<i> - One moment.</i>

09:47.020 --> 09:48.720
(ringing tone)

09:50.323 --> 09:51.556
<i> (effie): Julia, is that you?</i>

09:51.658 --> 09:53.024
- Effie!

09:53.026 --> 09:54.425
- What's the matter?

09:54.428 --> 09:57.228
- Yes, yes! Yes, effie!
I need your help.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.563
- Julia, what is going on?

09:58.665 --> 10:00.732
- I need you to come
to the clinic right away.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.167
- Yes. Yes, of course.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.803
- Just come, please?

10:08.408 --> 10:10.775
(breathing heavily)

10:13.113 --> 10:15.347
(door opens)

10:19.386 --> 10:21.319
(suspenseful music)

10:35.702 --> 10:36.568
(exhales)

10:36.570 --> 10:37.735
- Julia?

10:37.738 --> 10:38.837
- Effie.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.873
- Are-are you all right?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.675
- Yes, I think so.
I-I don't know.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.276
- Are-are you hurt?
Are you bleeding?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.145
- No. I-I'm fine.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.147
- What on earth is going on?

10:50.216 --> 10:51.449
- It was him.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.085
H-he's back. He's alive!

10:54.087 --> 10:55.153
- Who?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.489
- It's impossible! I do...

10:57.590 --> 10:58.823
- Julia.
- It makes no sense.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.892
- Slow down and tell me
exactly what happened.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.293
- I don't know what happened.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.695
- Just give me this.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.364
Where did this blood come from?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.500
- James gillies.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.670
- James gillies? The murderer?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.972
- I killed him!

11:13.974 --> 11:15.973
- But, julia, h-he's been
dead for years.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.843
- I know, but-but he was here,

11:18.945 --> 11:22.246
And he came at me,
and I killed him.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.781
- Julia, that's impossible.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.684
- I know! It makes no sense,

11:26.786 --> 11:27.986
But that's what happened.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.455
His brain was in the jar.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.657
And then it disappeared!

11:32.659 --> 11:34.926
And then he was here,
and he killed mathilda,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.128
He must have, and-and then
he came after me!

11:37.230 --> 11:39.030
- Julia, you need to calm down.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.399
- What day is it?

11:41.401 --> 11:42.634
- It's the 31st.
(thunder rumbling)

11:42.736 --> 11:44.536
- Oh, my lord!
- What?

11:44.538 --> 11:47.038
- That's the day james gillies
was hanged.

11:48.174 --> 11:50.408
- That explains
all of this then.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.442
- Explains what?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.944
- Well, why you're so
fixated on him!

11:53.046 --> 11:55.079
Your mind has been triggered
and your imagination's

11:55.181 --> 11:58.183
Playing tricks on you.
- No! No! It was real.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.551
He was here and I killed him!

12:00.554 --> 12:02.086
He-he's in the examination room.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.755
- I'll tell you what:
Why don't we go together

12:03.757 --> 12:05.089
And see if he's there?
- No, no.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.691
No, I'm not going. I can't.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.025
- All right, then I'll go.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.027
- No, please, effie, don't go--
- julia. Julia,

12:10.030 --> 12:11.429
I'll be right back.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.831
Everything's going to be
all right.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.899
I'll be back in the briefest
of moments.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.167
(thunder rumbling)

12:16.269 --> 12:17.435
You'll be all right.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.538
I'll be right back.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.809
(voice deepening):
And we'll have so much fun.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.077
- What?

12:26.179 --> 12:29.047
Effie, why did you say that?
What did you say?!

12:29.750 --> 12:31.182
- I said...

12:31.284 --> 12:34.519
We're going to have so much fun.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.755
(sinister music)

12:36.856 --> 12:38.056
- No!

12:40.393 --> 12:41.525
(julia screams)

12:41.528 --> 12:43.027
(clattering)

12:46.333 --> 12:47.866
(grunting)

12:47.868 --> 12:48.767
No!

12:50.770 --> 12:51.803
(grunting)

12:51.904 --> 12:52.971
(glass shattering)

12:55.208 --> 12:56.608
(grunting)

12:58.077 --> 12:59.878
(panting)

13:01.581 --> 13:03.281
Effie?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.415
Effie?!

13:06.353 --> 13:07.552
(whispering): Effie?

13:10.990 --> 13:11.956
Effie?

13:13.392 --> 13:15.226
(eerie music)

13:19.065 --> 13:20.398
(thunder cracking)

13:20.400 --> 13:21.800
Mathilda?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.202
Mathilda.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.337
No!

13:27.473 --> 13:30.108
No, it can't be.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.445
What is happening?

13:36.182 --> 13:37.448
No!

13:38.718 --> 13:40.117
(panting)

13:40.120 --> 13:41.486
Effie?

13:42.188 --> 13:43.421
Effie?

13:53.299 --> 13:54.799
Effie?

13:54.801 --> 13:57.235
(breathing heavily)

13:59.706 --> 14:01.472
I'm so sorry.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.407
I'm so sorry! I--

14:03.410 --> 14:05.543
I don't know what's going on!

14:06.346 --> 14:08.146
- Why?
(gasping)

14:08.148 --> 14:10.315
Why did you do this?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.084
- You were him!

14:13.185 --> 14:14.853
You were james gillies.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.388
- Why?

14:22.461 --> 14:24.395
(gasping)

14:29.535 --> 14:31.035
What have I done?

14:32.906 --> 14:34.339
What have I done?

14:42.115 --> 14:43.447
- Mealtime.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.549
(door clunks)

14:47.921 --> 14:49.120
You need to eat.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.123
Up to you.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.359
Food's not going anywhere...

14:55.261 --> 14:56.126
Julia.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.795
(tense music)

14:57.797 --> 14:59.463
(gasps)

14:59.565 --> 15:00.531
- You!

15:00.633 --> 15:02.333
- Of course.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.867
Who else would it be?

15:03.870 --> 15:05.236
- Why are you doing this to me?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.073
Please, leave me alone.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.209
- Oh, you'll be left alone,
julia.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.344
- No.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.479
- You can just sit right here,

15:15.482 --> 15:17.749
Think about what you've done

15:17.751 --> 15:20.518
For the rest of eternity.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.687
You got what you wished for:

15:23.690 --> 15:25.556
No responsibilities.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.627
(sinister music)

15:29.629 --> 15:32.030
(laughing)

15:35.902 --> 15:37.302
(door clunks)

15:51.117 --> 15:54.385
- Imagine a young woman
who has it all,

15:54.387 --> 15:56.987
Fortune and fame.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.390
But fame comes at a price.

15:59.492 --> 16:03.795
If one wishes to disappear
into the faceless masses,

16:03.896 --> 16:05.863
What happens...

16:05.865 --> 16:07.432
When that wish comes true?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.635
(sinister music)

16:16.108 --> 16:17.041
- What'd you think?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.642
- Preposterous.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.943
- It seemed real to me.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.545
(scoffs)
a whole town ganging up

16:21.548 --> 16:23.014
On that man just
'cause he was different?

16:23.115 --> 16:25.816
- The man was made
of reanimated body parts.

16:25.819 --> 16:26.817
- So?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.753
- The dead can't come
back to life, isaiah!

16:29.522 --> 16:30.722
- Tell that to your father.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.756
- Touché.
(chuckling)

16:32.759 --> 16:34.225
- Miss hart,
couple of questions.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.426
- We haven't the time.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.427
- Will you be taking legal

16:36.529 --> 16:37.628
Action against
the carmichael family?

16:37.730 --> 16:38.562
- No comment.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.830
- And who are you?

16:39.833 --> 16:42.366
- A man telling you
to leave her be.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.769
(tense music)

16:47.774 --> 16:49.240
- Sorry about that.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.908
- Hardly your fault.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.244
- I'm the one that chose
to marry into that family.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.445
- Hmm.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.712
You were in love.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.914
- I suppose so.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.450
I also liked the scandal
and attention.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.719
These days I can't stand it.

17:01.821 --> 17:02.920
I never thought I'd say this,

17:03.022 --> 17:06.190
But I wish I could just blend in
like everyone else.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.191
- You?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.727
A woman as beautiful
as violet hart

17:09.829 --> 17:11.729
Could never blend
into the crowd.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.397
(chuckles)
- oh, stop.

17:13.399 --> 17:15.533
(thunder rumbling)

17:15.634 --> 17:17.534
- You want me to walk you
the rest of the way?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.804
- Oh. It's out of your way.
I'll be fine.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.807
- As you wish.

17:22.908 --> 17:24.675
Good night.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.277
I'll call on you tomorrow.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.915
(soft music)

17:36.156 --> 17:38.689
(thunder cracking)

17:48.734 --> 17:51.168
(clattering)

17:51.270 --> 17:52.637
- Sir, are you all right?

17:55.475 --> 17:56.774
Do you need help?

17:58.044 --> 17:59.077
Sir?

18:01.114 --> 18:02.513
There's a church
around the corner.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.981
They'll take you in
if you need any--

18:03.983 --> 18:06.084
Ah! Get off of me!

18:06.185 --> 18:08.319
(breathing heavily)

18:08.421 --> 18:09.920
(groaning)

18:09.923 --> 18:11.722
Dear god.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.790
(shouting)

18:13.793 --> 18:15.693
- Hey! Hey.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.361
(grunting)

18:20.066 --> 18:21.465
(clattering)

18:22.101 --> 18:23.601
You all right?
- Yes, I think so.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.536
- You should get out of here.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.205
- The morgue is right
around the corner.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.574
(distant screaming)

18:33.846 --> 18:35.279
- You keep a gun?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.748
- For safety.
- You get a lot of intruders?

18:37.850 --> 18:38.949
- More than I'd like.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.018
- Well, it might prove useful.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.686
- Do you think
that man followed us?

18:42.689 --> 18:46.157
- No. But something strange
is happening in toronto tonight.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.626
Ooh!
- Are you all right?

18:48.727 --> 18:49.627
- Oh...

18:49.629 --> 18:51.061
Oh, fine.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.630
(panting)
- you're hurt.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.565
- What?
- This wound on your hand.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.468
- Whoa! That man
must have bitten me.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.770
- What, just now?
That's impossible.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.574
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's badly infected.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.110
To get to this point,
it would have taken days.

19:06.212 --> 19:07.844
- Well, perhaps he was ill.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.980
(sighs)
- come on.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.114
We need to clean this.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.752
(grunts)

19:15.588 --> 19:17.588
Now, this might hurt.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.323
(exclaiming)

19:19.425 --> 19:23.594
- Ah, I've never felt such
a deep pain in my life. Oh!

19:23.596 --> 19:25.362
- We're almost done.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.531
Everything's going
to be all right.

19:26.632 --> 19:27.932
- Mm-hmm.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.734
(groans)

19:29.736 --> 19:32.236
- Too tight?
- Oh, no, no, no. It's fine.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.574
- There we go.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.446
(suspenseful music)

19:43.249 --> 19:45.116
- Miss hart? What's wrong?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.454
Oh, dear god!
- Get out of the way!

19:50.556 --> 19:51.722
- Huh?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.759
(objects clattering)

19:54.860 --> 19:55.926
(gunshot)

19:56.028 --> 19:56.994
(grunting)

19:58.030 --> 19:59.230
(grunting)

19:59.232 --> 20:00.498
- He's still alive!

20:01.768 --> 20:02.899
What are we going to do?

20:02.902 --> 20:05.302
- I-I would suggest we leave.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.305
And then what?
- Telephone the army?

20:08.241 --> 20:09.540
(grunting)

20:09.542 --> 20:11.943
Let's go.
- Wait. I have an idea.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.846
You lure him over and I'll come
behind him and shove him in.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.782
- Oh, I...

20:17.784 --> 20:18.716
Oh, fine!

20:18.817 --> 20:20.183
Excuse me, my good man!

20:20.186 --> 20:22.987
Would you care to attack me?
(grunting)

20:22.989 --> 20:24.488
Yes? Right over here.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.224
Oh, oh!
(objects clattering)

20:27.193 --> 20:28.459
All right, this way.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.727
Yes, that's very good.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.662
Ah, yes, yes, just as I'd hoped.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.730
Yes!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.198
Feast away. Ha!

20:34.200 --> 20:35.766
- Llewellyn! No!

20:35.768 --> 20:38.002
(all groaning)
- oh! That's not good.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.071
(grunting)

20:45.644 --> 20:47.078
(groaning)

20:48.081 --> 20:49.046
- Hold them!

20:49.048 --> 20:50.648
- Yeah, I'm trying!

20:57.190 --> 20:58.689
(screaming)

20:58.791 --> 21:00.424
(exclaiming)

21:00.526 --> 21:02.026
(panting)

21:03.196 --> 21:04.628
- What the hell is going on?

21:04.630 --> 21:05.896
- Some kind of madness.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.232
- It's impossible.
Those people are dead.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.666
(thumping on door)

21:09.669 --> 21:12.770
- Well, they've returned
to life. Or something like it.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.172
- Oh.
(groaning)

21:15.274 --> 21:16.674
What's wrong?

21:17.676 --> 21:19.443
- Something's not right.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.246
The bite. The infection, it's...

21:22.348 --> 21:24.115
Taking over my body.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.952
I must be like--
- no. It can't be.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.922
- My mind keeps going blank.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.324
(breathing heavily)

21:33.426 --> 21:35.559
Violet. Violet,
you have to promise.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.595
Don't let that happen to me!

21:38.697 --> 21:41.065
- I won't. You're going
to be all right.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.934
- I am most certainly
not all right.

21:44.504 --> 21:47.338
Before I turn,
you have to kill me.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.206
- No!
- You have to.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.542
Don't let me
become one of them!

21:51.544 --> 21:52.743
- All right.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.211
Let me try something.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.080
(breathing heavily)

21:58.584 --> 22:00.284
If you turn into one
of those things,

22:00.286 --> 22:01.752
I'll inject you.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.754
There's enough heroin
in here to kill a horse.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.756
- Good. Good.

22:05.758 --> 22:06.957
(grunting)
- how is it?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.693
(groaning)

22:08.794 --> 22:11.796
- It's coming on.
(breathing heavily)

22:11.798 --> 22:13.196
This could be it!

22:13.199 --> 22:15.098
- No. Just hold on.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.635
- Do it. Do it, do it.
There's no reason to wait.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.035
(panting)

22:19.038 --> 22:20.838
(groaning)

22:20.939 --> 22:21.972
(screaming): Brains!

22:21.974 --> 22:23.039
(screaming)

22:23.042 --> 22:25.643
(liquid trickling)

22:33.619 --> 22:34.518
- Watts?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.554
(screaming)

22:37.423 --> 22:38.522
(gunshot)

22:38.624 --> 22:40.257
(panting)

22:42.728 --> 22:43.761
Isaiah?

22:45.932 --> 22:47.365
Isaiah?

22:50.169 --> 22:52.069
- Violet?
- We have to get out of here!

22:52.772 --> 22:53.670
- Violet, what's wrong?

22:53.772 --> 22:55.606
- They're coming for us.
We have to go!

22:55.707 --> 22:56.941
- What's wrong with you?

22:58.644 --> 23:00.378
(growling)

23:01.881 --> 23:03.647
You're one of them!

23:04.283 --> 23:05.850
You're just like them!

23:09.188 --> 23:11.355
(growling)

23:23.936 --> 23:27.905
- Four and twenty blackbirds
baked in a pie.

23:28.006 --> 23:32.242
When the pie was open,
tom began to scream.

23:32.245 --> 23:36.647
What a horrid nightmare
from such a lovely dream.

23:37.817 --> 23:41.018
(sinister music)

23:46.125 --> 23:47.525
(metallic thump)

23:47.626 --> 23:49.093
- Bloody hell! Higgins!

23:51.731 --> 23:53.530
Sir?
- Another trap's gone off.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.432
- Oh.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.601
Oh, looks like we got one.

23:57.703 --> 23:58.802
- Oh, these rodents,

23:58.904 --> 24:00.137
They're all over
the bloody city!

24:00.139 --> 24:01.805
(grunts)
- what would you like me to do

24:01.807 --> 24:02.807
With this one?

24:02.908 --> 24:04.808
- What kind of question
is that? Throw it away.

24:04.810 --> 24:05.910
- Oh, right.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.545
- Ah, margaret.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.347
To what do I owe the pleasure?

24:10.449 --> 24:13.150
- I've brought you lunch.
- Oh! And what do we have here?

24:13.152 --> 24:15.018
- It's an old family recipe.
- Ah!

24:15.120 --> 24:17.755
- Minced meat and onion pie.

24:17.757 --> 24:18.956
- Oh!
- Try it!

24:19.057 --> 24:20.558
- I will! Looks good.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.493
(chuckling)

24:22.594 --> 24:23.694
Have you seen the paper?

24:23.796 --> 24:25.229
- Oh!

24:25.330 --> 24:26.697
- There's been trouble.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.300
Too many prisoners,
not enough cells.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.703
That could be good for bobby
at his next parole hearing.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.038
- Oh, I don't know, thomas.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.041
We've gotten our
hopes up before.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.176
- Bobby's been a model prisoner.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.245
We can only hope that he'll be
home soon.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.779
Bring the family
back together again.

24:42.782 --> 24:46.717
- Hmm. Well, actually,
I'm off to visit him today.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.152
Look what I got for him.
- Mm. What's that?

24:49.155 --> 24:50.521
- A rosary.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.389
- Still on the catholic
kick, is he?

24:52.391 --> 24:55.693
- It's his choice, thomas.
Isn't it beautiful?

24:58.531 --> 24:59.796
(curious music)

24:59.898 --> 25:01.865
- Good lord!
- What?

25:01.967 --> 25:04.868
- This pie, margaret,
it's absolutely terrific!

25:05.504 --> 25:07.204
The best bloody pie
I've ever tasted.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.139
- Oh, I knew you'd like it.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.341
- More than like.

25:11.477 --> 25:12.676
You know,

25:12.678 --> 25:14.512
There's a police
fundraiser coming up.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.080
I bet we could sell
some of these

25:17.083 --> 25:18.449
And make a few bob.

25:18.551 --> 25:19.649
- Sold!
- Mm.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.253
(laughing)

25:22.354 --> 25:23.621
Mmm.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.089
- Thank you so much.
There you are.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.692
How's it going?
- Oh, thomas.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.894
- What is it?
- That's it.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.228
We're sold out.
(laughing)

25:32.231 --> 25:34.298
- Really?
How many did we sell?

25:34.399 --> 25:37.368
- Three dozen!
- We sold three dozen already?

25:38.270 --> 25:39.369
- People seem to like them.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.038
- Mrs. Brackenreid!

25:41.139 --> 25:42.940
This pie is incredibly
delicious.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.975
Honestly, I've never
had a pie like it.

25:47.946 --> 25:49.580
- We may be onto
something here, margaret.

25:49.681 --> 25:50.848
- Onto what?

25:50.850 --> 25:52.783
- Something big.

25:52.785 --> 25:53.784
- Ooh!

25:55.153 --> 25:56.853
(chuckling)

25:56.955 --> 25:59.189
(curious music)

26:03.562 --> 26:05.729
- Thank you for coming,
everyone. It's nice to see ya.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.798
Make sure you take an extra pie
for your loved ones.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.200
(meowing)
oh! Oi! Get lost!

26:11.103 --> 26:13.137
These bloody strays are
a nuisance around here, ladies.

26:13.238 --> 26:17.273
- Thomas! We're almost sold out
and it's only our first day!

26:17.276 --> 26:19.476
- We're a hit.
We're the talk of the town!

26:19.478 --> 26:21.178
- Mm-hmm!
- Looks like we're going

26:21.280 --> 26:23.213
To need to hire some help.
- Absolutely not!

26:23.315 --> 26:25.882
- Why not?
- The recipe's a family secret,

26:25.885 --> 26:28.886
Thomas. I don't want every tom,
dick and harry to know it.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.521
- What about a couple
of waiters? What's the problem?

26:31.623 --> 26:34.291
- Fine. But they stay out
of the kitchen.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.560
It's a family business, thomas.
I want to keep it that way.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.228
(laughing)
- we're gonna make a mint.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.563
- Mm-hmm.
- Leave them wanting more!

26:39.665 --> 26:40.563
- Yes!

26:40.566 --> 26:41.865
(chuckling)

26:43.969 --> 26:47.438
- Mmm. Sir.
These pies are divine.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.106
I can't stop eating them.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.375
- No need to stop, higgins.
It's all money in my pocket.

26:51.477 --> 26:52.576
(chuckling)

26:52.678 --> 26:54.377
How's things with
the rat problem?

26:55.080 --> 26:56.647
- Well, I haven't seen
any lately, sir. Have you?

26:56.748 --> 26:58.882
- They seem to have disappeared.
- Hmm.

26:59.551 --> 27:00.451
Mm.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.120
- Ow! Ow!

27:03.222 --> 27:04.788
- What's the matter?
- Oh.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.590
I think I've bitten
into something.

27:06.692 --> 27:07.691
- What is it?

27:07.693 --> 27:09.326
(gulping)

27:09.428 --> 27:10.861
- I think I've swallowed it.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.062
- Well, what was it?

27:12.164 --> 27:13.397
- I don't know!

27:14.800 --> 27:16.233
I think I've cracked
my tooth, as well.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.536
- Perhaps your wife
dropped something in?

27:19.538 --> 27:20.871
- Not bloody likely.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.006
I'd best have a word with her.

27:23.108 --> 27:24.908
- Hmm. Mine's fine.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.077
(curious music)

27:30.683 --> 27:32.482
(birds chirping)

27:32.485 --> 27:33.984
- There was something
in this pie.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.552
- Yes, meat.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.155
- No! No, no. Something hard.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.423
I bit down on it.

27:39.525 --> 27:40.824
- Well, maybe it was your tooth.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.592
- It wasn't my bloody tooth.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.362
It was a... A stone,
or some such thing.

27:45.364 --> 27:46.697
- Well, I didn't
put it in there.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.598
- I never said you did.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.701
- Well, if I didn't
put it in there,

27:50.802 --> 27:51.902
Then it wasn't in there.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.437
- Something was in there.
(sighs)

27:53.538 --> 27:55.706
I never said it was your fault,

27:55.708 --> 27:56.974
But it could've gotten mixed in

27:56.976 --> 27:58.542
With whatever
you put in the pie.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.310
(sighs)
- fine.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.279
Perhaps it was in the meat.
- Right.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.048
Where does the meat come from?

28:05.150 --> 28:06.550
(sighs)
- thomas,

28:06.651 --> 28:09.653
I'm too busy right now.
I have to make more pies!

28:09.755 --> 28:10.820
(sighs)

28:10.923 --> 28:12.689
- Just tell me
the name of the shop.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.191
(scoffs)
- what does it matter?

28:14.292 --> 28:16.126
- It matters because there
was a bloody stone in it!

28:16.228 --> 28:17.628
- Just leave it.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.064
- Which butcher
do we buy the meat from?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.800
- I told you to leave it.

28:23.902 --> 28:25.469
- Why is it such
a bloody secret?

28:25.471 --> 28:26.537
- Because it is.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.339
Now let me get on with my work!

28:34.346 --> 28:36.513
(curious music)

28:47.392 --> 28:49.293
- Todd mcsweeney.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.828
Right then.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.697
(tense music)

29:25.397 --> 29:26.863
(gagging)

29:26.866 --> 29:28.565
(sinister music)

29:42.915 --> 29:44.481
Higgins! Stop eating that!

29:44.583 --> 29:47.284
- What? Why?
- Just stop. I'll explain later.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.352
- Explain what?

29:48.354 --> 29:49.753
- Just stop right now!

29:50.556 --> 29:52.456
- Sir, they're so good.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.092
- Bloody hell, higgins.

29:56.094 --> 29:59.263
Throw it away and never
come back here again.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.466
(tense music)

30:05.304 --> 30:06.770
(exhales)

30:15.347 --> 30:17.247
- I don't understand, thomas.

30:17.249 --> 30:20.116
Why are you at home?
Thomas, what is it?

30:20.119 --> 30:22.685
- You, we, are out
of the pie business!

30:22.688 --> 30:24.588
- What are you talking about?

30:24.690 --> 30:25.989
- I've got something to tell ya.

30:26.091 --> 30:28.458
(scoffs)
- then start telling.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.328
Honestly, thomas, I don't know
what's gotten into you today.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.130
You're acting like a madman.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.131
- I'm not a madman. Far from it.

30:35.133 --> 30:37.668
(scoffs)
- you're making no sense.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.337
- It's the bloody butcher.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.340
- You are talking in riddles,
thomas.

30:43.441 --> 30:45.275
What about the butcher?

30:45.277 --> 30:47.344
- Have a seat!
Go, go! Have a seat.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.312
- All right.

30:49.414 --> 30:50.747
- Good god.

30:51.783 --> 30:52.883
How do I tell ya?

30:52.984 --> 30:54.885
- Oh, thomas, out with it!

30:57.923 --> 30:58.922
- Margaret,

31:00.092 --> 31:02.092
We can't keep
selling these pies.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.060
- Why not?

31:04.396 --> 31:05.562
- It's the meat.

31:06.632 --> 31:07.764
The butcher.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.833
I went over there,

31:10.836 --> 31:12.269
Saw it with my own eyes.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.539
The meat they're using--
- I know, thomas.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.643
It's how we get
such a good price.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.748
- You know what's in there?
- Of course I do.

31:26.351 --> 31:27.751
- Dear god, woman.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.953
Have you lost your mind?

31:30.656 --> 31:32.789
- It makes perfect sense.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.124
- Sense?

31:35.226 --> 31:36.793
Insanity's what it is!

31:36.895 --> 31:38.996
- Oh, calm down.

31:39.097 --> 31:41.131
It's good for everyone. And...

31:42.133 --> 31:43.500
They are delicious.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.203
(sinister music)

31:47.272 --> 31:48.271
- No!

31:48.274 --> 31:49.539
(scoffs)

31:49.541 --> 31:51.140
- It's all right, thomas.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.609
The city is finally rid
of vermin.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.945
Just as you wished.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.649
(♪♪)

32:13.732 --> 32:16.566
- Every father
loves his daughter.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.503
He would shelter
her from harm.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.172
He would kill for her.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.075
But would he die for her?

32:26.077 --> 32:28.478
(sinister music)

32:30.615 --> 32:31.982
(susannah babbling)

32:32.083 --> 32:36.053
- The princess returns
to her castle.

32:36.154 --> 32:39.055
(laughing)
again, thank you so much

32:39.058 --> 32:41.858
For taking on this extra work
while dr. Ogden is away.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.061
- But of course. You know how
much I adore little susannah.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.263
(chuckling)

32:46.999 --> 32:47.998
- What's this?

32:48.099 --> 32:49.566
(susannah): Sissy.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.368
(nanny scoffs)

32:52.371 --> 32:54.738
- Did she just say sissy?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.406
- Seems to be her name for it.

32:57.076 --> 33:00.010
- Oh...
The child can barely speak.

33:00.111 --> 33:03.279
Did someone tell her
that the doll is named sissy?

33:03.381 --> 33:05.415
- No. She named it herself.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.884
A kind old man in the park
gave it to her.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.619
She's really taken to it.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.421
- A man?

33:11.523 --> 33:12.622
A stranger?

33:14.493 --> 33:17.494
We must be very careful.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.130
I can't allow anyone
near susannah

33:20.232 --> 33:22.432
That could put her in danger.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.835
- He was awfully kind.

33:24.837 --> 33:28.105
And, as I say,
she's really taken to the doll.

33:28.941 --> 33:30.240
(susannah): Sissy.

33:31.209 --> 33:32.709
- It's rather odd-looking.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.344
(nanny chuckles)

33:37.015 --> 33:38.115
I don't know.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.450
I-I don't want to bring
anything into this house

33:40.452 --> 33:42.251
That could be harmful
to susannah.

33:42.254 --> 33:45.055
- Oh, it's harmless and look!

33:45.924 --> 33:48.058
(sissy laughing)

33:48.159 --> 33:49.058
- Oh!

33:49.928 --> 33:54.263
It's been fitted with
a voice box of some kind.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.700
- And that's not all it does.
Press it again.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.171
<i> (sissy): I love you.</i>

34:03.275 --> 34:05.875
♪ london bridge

34:05.878 --> 34:08.278
♪ falling down, falling-- ♪♪

34:08.379 --> 34:10.480
(sissy laughing)

34:10.582 --> 34:14.884
- Three distinct sounds.
That's ingenious! Hmm.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.753
- I think you like it
as much as she does.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.355
(exhales)

34:19.991 --> 34:21.992
- As long as it
makes her happy.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.194
(sighs)

34:26.998 --> 34:29.900
Oh! Susannah, are you awake?

34:30.569 --> 34:32.436
Are you ready for lunch?

34:33.439 --> 34:34.404
All right.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.650
(crying)

34:46.652 --> 34:48.952
All right. Oh!

34:51.990 --> 34:53.457
What is this?

34:54.126 --> 34:55.692
Did you draw this?

34:55.793 --> 34:58.095
(eerie music)

35:06.338 --> 35:08.472
(ominous music)

35:11.310 --> 35:13.809
Oh, come, now, susannah.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.545
You have to eat your food.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.147

35:17.149 --> 35:18.281
Milk!

What happened?

35:35.667 --> 35:36.833
What's all this?

35:39.404 --> 35:41.837
How did you get the bowl--?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.306

(murdoch whistling)

35:57.889 --> 35:59.389
(crying)

35:59.490 --> 36:04.327
This doll of yours has gotten
that tune stuck in my head.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.964
That's enough of that for today.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.034
(susannah crying)

36:14.673 --> 36:16.006
Susannah...?

36:16.008 --> 36:17.874
(eerie music)

36:17.976 --> 36:20.610
(crying continues)

36:20.612 --> 36:23.213
All right. All right.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.416
It's time to go to sleep.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.752
I know.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.801
- What on earth?

37:18.903 --> 37:20.670
<i> (sissy): I love you.</i>

37:22.841 --> 37:25.141
- All right.
That's enough of this.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.746
(susannah babbling)

37:34.219 --> 37:35.952
- Sissy.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.456

37:41.793 --> 37:42.892
(sighs)

37:42.994 --> 37:44.094
All right.

37:44.195 --> 37:47.764
Let's lay down

37:47.766 --> 37:49.432
And have a little sleep.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.103
(babbling)

37:53.204 --> 37:54.571
Night-night.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.039
(susannah): Night-night.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.910

Hello?

This can't be. Wha--?

40:28.193 --> 40:29.391
Ah!

40:29.394 --> 40:31.694
God. Ahh!

40:37.068 --> 40:38.802

40:40.138 --> 40:41.737
This can't be happening.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.973

Oh, my goodness.

All right. We...

41:47.506 --> 41:50.540

...Should get you back in bed.

Susannah-- ahh!

42:15.166 --> 42:16.299
Susannah...

42:16.935 --> 42:18.434
Please give me the knife.

42:19.371 --> 42:20.703
Susannah?

42:20.805 --> 42:23.039

Susannah,

42:34.352 --> 42:35.818
Y-you can't let her.

42:41.492 --> 42:42.592
No!

42:42.693 --> 42:43.826
No!

42:59.377 --> 43:01.210
Julia has begged off.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.278
She can't come.
- Hmm. What a shame.

43:03.281 --> 43:04.747
- Oh, well, that's that then.

43:05.617 --> 43:08.050
- But, sir, it's one day only.

43:08.053 --> 43:10.353
- I wanted to see
the little one at the fair.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.088
I have no interest
if that's not the case.

43:12.189 --> 43:13.957
- Me, as well.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.561
- Enjoy the candy floss,
higgins.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.698
- I can go?
- Go on!

43:21.799 --> 43:23.499
Hop it before I change my mind.

43:23.501 --> 43:24.701
(chuckles)
- thank you, sir.

43:24.802 --> 43:27.036
You know, I've heard
they have a mechanical man

43:27.138 --> 43:28.771
Who will grant you
your dearest wish.

43:28.873 --> 43:30.773
I'm so looking forward
to trying it.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.575
Oh, and I'm going to find
that chicken juggler, too.

43:32.677 --> 43:34.944
(curious music)

43:35.613 --> 43:38.114
- Your wish made true.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.550
