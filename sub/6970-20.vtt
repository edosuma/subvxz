WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:06.506
We're almost there.

00:06.541 --> 00:08.508
How you doin', hon?

00:08.543 --> 00:11.011
Breathe deeply.

00:11.046 --> 00:14.147
Just like that. There you go.
You're doin' great.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.633
Yeah, real great.

00:16.668 --> 00:20.153
Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am, i'll need your
full name and social security number.

00:20.737 --> 00:24.441
Amanda nelligan.
545020809.

00:24.476 --> 00:27.327
Your insurance carrier?
Great. Atlantic mutual.

00:27.362 --> 00:29.429
Is there anyone you need us
to contact?

00:29.464 --> 00:32.465
The father of the baby? I'm not
sure how to get ahold of him.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.352
- Give me his name. I can try.
- He's not from around here.

00:36.387 --> 00:39.873
- Is he from out of state?
- Another planet.

00:42.776 --> 00:46.346
All right, we're here now.
Hold on.

00:50.368 --> 00:53.253
One more little push, amanda.

00:53.288 --> 00:57.057
There you go. You're gonna set
a speed record. Great.

00:57.092 --> 01:00.110
There's a cute face.
Doll syringe.

01:01.678 --> 01:04.681
This is like the indy 500.

01:05.181 --> 01:07.684
Here comes the shoulder.

01:08.184 --> 01:11.071
Good.
Okay, amanda.

01:11.106 --> 01:14.541
That'll do it!
Oh.

01:14.576 --> 01:16.443
Oh, god.

01:16.478 --> 01:21.231
- What? What is it?
- It's okay. She's just fine.

01:21.266 --> 01:25.085
Perfectly healthy.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.788
No problem.
Everything's gonna be a-ok.

01:28.823 --> 01:31.791
You've got a healthy
baby girl.

01:31.826 --> 01:35.128
Oh, a little girl!

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074

01:44.771 --> 01:48.691
Good lord,
not another one!

02:21.956 --> 02:24.926
I admit the photo's
a little over the top,

02:24.961 --> 02:27.212
but, um,
what do you think, scully?

02:27.247 --> 02:29.464
Not seriously.

02:29.499 --> 02:33.184
Children born with vestigial tails
don't interest you? Codal appendages.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.454
Fetuses have them. Their coccyx
enlarges to contain the spinal fluid,

02:36.489 --> 02:39.457
and then it shrinks
as the child develops.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.459
Occasionally, it doesn't.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.328
It's extremely rare but it
has been known to happen.

02:43.363 --> 02:46.281
Five times within
the last three months?

02:46.316 --> 02:49.617
All in a town with a population
of less than 15,000 people?

02:49.652 --> 02:52.804
I'd say that's a little more than
a statistical anomaly. So would i.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.757
No, mulder, l...
i think you're right.

02:55.792 --> 02:59.761
I think that something about this
definitely warrants investigation.

02:59.796 --> 03:03.932
Only not by us. I'd say that it is a
job for the local health department.

03:03.967 --> 03:06.768
I called around.
They're already investigating.

03:06.803 --> 03:10.855
So what else about this
interests you?

03:10.890 --> 03:14.676
Could it be, uh,
visitors from space?

03:20.014 --> 03:22.016
The doctor said that...

03:22.051 --> 03:24.018
my baby's gonna be fine.

03:24.053 --> 03:26.020
She's really healthy.

03:26.521 --> 03:29.023
And when she gets to be
a few months old,

03:29.058 --> 03:31.142
it's just a matter
of "snip."

03:31.177 --> 03:33.328
- That's good to hear.
- Yeah.

03:33.363 --> 03:38.133
Did you experience any unusual
complications during your pregnancy?

03:38.168 --> 03:41.236
Did you undergo any kind
of fertility treatment?

03:41.271 --> 03:43.738
No. I wasn't trying
to get pregnant.

03:43.773 --> 03:48.493
I guess you could just sort
of say i'm a single mom now.

03:48.528 --> 03:51.863
When you were admitted,
you said that the, uh,

03:51.898 --> 03:53.865
the baby's father
was from another planet.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.667
What did you mean by that
exactly?

03:55.702 --> 03:59.254
You know, that...
he's not from this planet.

03:59.289 --> 04:01.873
Were you abducted?

04:01.908 --> 04:05.260
Huh?
no.

04:05.295 --> 04:09.197
No. He dropped by
my apartment one day,

04:09.232 --> 04:12.200
and one thing
sort of led to another.

04:12.235 --> 04:14.919
But the baby's father
is an alien.

04:14.954 --> 04:19.690
No! No, i didn't say he was an alien.
I said he was from another planet.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.827
His name is luke skywalker. He's
what's known as a jedi knight.

04:29.083 --> 04:32.437
- Did he have a light saber?
- No, he didn't bring it.

04:32.904 --> 04:37.442
He did sing a song for me,
though.

04:44.449 --> 04:47.352
How many times have you seen
star wars, amanda?

04:47.387 --> 04:49.771
Three hundred sixty-eight.

04:50.271 --> 04:53.775
I should break 400
by memorial day.

04:53.810 --> 04:56.778
Okay.
Thank you.

04:56.813 --> 05:00.131
Wait a minute, wait.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.251
You know these four other babies
that were born here with tails?

05:03.286 --> 05:07.255
- Uh-huh. - There
couldn't be any chance...

05:07.290 --> 05:09.557
luke's the father, is there?

05:22.954 --> 05:27.625
Okay, all right.
I've got it, thank you.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.527
Take your best shot, scully.

05:30.028 --> 05:33.531
I think there's more going on here
than luke skywalker and his light saber.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.034
I think you're right.

05:37.535 --> 05:39.537
Are you coming?

05:44.259 --> 05:47.612
Here are the p.c.r. S that
we ran for the five children.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.614
We put calls into the parents.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.449
We'll blood test
all the husbands,

05:51.484 --> 05:54.118
hopefully by this afternoon
just to double-check. Good.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.005
They'll be none too happy.
I have to confess...

05:57.040 --> 06:00.792
this answer seems so strangely obvious, i
probably wouldn't have even checked for it.

06:03.011 --> 06:05.013
What answer?

06:05.048 --> 06:09.734
You see here, these
identical band trait matches,

06:09.769 --> 06:12.954
all showing a small loss of a
part of chromosome number eight?

06:12.989 --> 06:17.208
Each of these five children, born to five
different women, all share the same father.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.345
- Yeah?
- I should have thought of it sooner.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.131
This kind of appended birth defect
is often passed on within a family.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.700
Meaning the father
had a tail as well?

06:25.735 --> 06:28.786
Though he most likely had it surgically
removed somewhere along the way.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.755
How would this happen?

06:30.790 --> 06:33.458
Birds and the bees and
the monkey babies, mulder.

06:33.493 --> 06:36.928
Birds do it, bees do it,
even educated m.d. S do it.

06:36.963 --> 06:41.265
All five of these women shared
the same ob-gyn, didn't they?

06:41.300 --> 06:43.718
Well, yeah.
He's the only one in town.

06:43.753 --> 06:47.722
And four of the five women, the four
married women, not including amanda nelligan,

06:47.757 --> 06:52.727
are on record as receiving insemination
therapy as a means of conception.

06:54.228 --> 06:56.731
So you're thinking that the doctor
might have something to do with it?

06:56.766 --> 07:00.234
So much for not putting
all your eggs in one basket.

07:04.739 --> 07:08.743
we should find
the best lawyer we can.

07:08.778 --> 07:11.746
Because i definitely plan to
sue. That's all i'm saying, fred.

07:11.781 --> 07:14.749
babboo, let me do the
talking. I'll handle this.

07:14.784 --> 07:18.252
Just tell him we're gonna
sue. Ah, you too, huh?

07:22.256 --> 07:23.758
What the hell did you do?

07:23.793 --> 07:26.711
Yeah, alton.
What did you do?

07:26.746 --> 07:29.714
I didn't do anything. We're
gonna figure this out. I promise.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.999
Look, everybody,
just relax.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.636
- Don't you tell me to relax! What happened to my sperm?
- yeah, mine too!

07:35.671 --> 07:38.339
- Whose did you use?
- It's bad enough having a boy with a tail.

07:38.374 --> 07:41.342
Then you find out
it's not even yours!

07:41.377 --> 07:44.579
For god's sake, alton,
how many of us are there?

07:44.614 --> 07:47.582
I'm special agent mulder with the
federal bureau of investigation.

07:47.617 --> 07:50.585
- This is agent scully.
- Great! Arrest this son of a bitch.

07:50.620 --> 07:53.021
No, sir, settle down.
Nobody's going to be arrested.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.874
- We're just here to find out what's goin' on.
- Alton didn't use my sperm.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.060
I most certainly did.
Each of you women...

07:59.095 --> 08:01.646
was inseminated with your husband's
own sperm and nobody else's.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.449
Why was it necessary
to inseminate in these cases?

08:04.484 --> 08:08.503
It was a sperm motility issue. The
intrauterine process that i used...

08:08.538 --> 08:10.755
has about a 40 percent
chance of success.

08:10.790 --> 08:14.509
I was surprised. It seemed
to work all four times.

08:16.010 --> 08:19.013
The only thing i can think of is... what?

08:19.048 --> 08:20.765
Maybe it never worked
at all.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.535
What are you saying? I want
to know what he means by that.

08:24.570 --> 08:28.823
I haven't been with a man since
1989. i mean, not counting you, honey.

08:28.858 --> 08:31.242
I'm not accusing anyone
of anything.

08:31.743 --> 08:35.830
I'm just saying, this latest patient of
mine who gave birth to a baby with a tail?

08:35.865 --> 08:37.832
She didn't even undergo
insemination.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.635
So you are blaming
the wrong baby doctor.

08:52.897 --> 08:57.385
Hey.

09:07.412 --> 09:09.247
Excuse me.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.033
I'm an agent with the federal
bureau of investigation.

09:12.068 --> 09:14.268
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

09:14.852 --> 09:17.638
Uh, yeah, okay.

09:29.734 --> 09:33.471
Scully, check it out.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.176
Oh, my god.

09:42.980 --> 09:47.768
That's him?
He's the one?

09:47.803 --> 09:50.705
Five out of five.

09:51.539 --> 09:54.008
They spelled my name wrong.

09:54.043 --> 09:57.512
It's van blundht, with a
silent "h." B-l-u-n-d-h-t.

09:57.547 --> 09:59.514
We'll get right on that.

10:00.014 --> 10:01.516
Lots of people
spell it wrong.

10:02.016 --> 10:05.770
It's like dutch or somethin'.
Can i go now?

10:05.805 --> 10:08.389
No. There's a few things
we have to clear up first.

10:08.424 --> 10:11.292
Yeah.
Like how'd you do it?

10:11.327 --> 10:13.127
What do you mean,
"how'd i do it"?

10:13.162 --> 10:16.881
You're the father of five children, mr.
Van blundht. Is that not news to you?

10:16.916 --> 10:22.119
Do you have any insight into how five women
came to be inseminated with your sperm?

10:23.621 --> 10:25.490
You make it sound
so romantic.

10:25.525 --> 10:29.977
So you're, you're saying
there was romance involved?

10:30.012 --> 10:32.613
Why is that so hard
to believe?

10:32.648 --> 10:36.117
Just 'cause i was born with a
tail, no woman would want me?

10:36.152 --> 10:39.420
Maybe i got personality.
You ever think of that?

10:39.455 --> 10:41.539
You had sex
with these women?

10:41.574 --> 10:46.611
How is it that none of them have any
recollection, whatsoever, of that happening?

10:48.763 --> 10:52.667
Look, i'm not saying anything
one way or another.

10:52.702 --> 10:55.169
I'm just sayin',
hypothetically,

10:55.204 --> 10:58.890
if some woman wanted to have kids
and their husbands weren't capable,

10:58.925 --> 11:02.977
and everybody was happy,
and nobody got hurt,

11:03.012 --> 11:05.479
hypothetically,
where's the crime?

11:21.462 --> 11:25.466
If you're waitin' for my usual theory
as to what's goin' on, i don't have one.

11:25.501 --> 11:29.186
I do. On behalf of all
the women in the world,

11:29.221 --> 11:33.691
i seriously doubt this has
anything to do with consensual sex.

11:33.726 --> 11:36.477
I think it involved some
form of rohypnol-rape.

11:36.512 --> 11:40.531
The tranquilizer? I didn't think of
that. Called the "date rape drug."

11:40.566 --> 11:44.235
High doses of it cause a loosening
of inhibitions, memory loss.

11:44.270 --> 11:47.772
Now if van blundht was somehow able
to slip the drug to these women,

11:47.807 --> 11:50.274
especially in conjunction
with alcohol...

11:50.309 --> 11:53.578
yeah, but when and where would he have
had the opportunity to slip it to them?

11:53.613 --> 11:57.448
He identified these women through his
janitorial job at the medical park.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.784
He could've followed them
anywhere, to a club, to a bar.

11:59.819 --> 12:03.087
Those women don't look like the
type that do a lot of solo drinking.

12:03.122 --> 12:06.257
I think it's enough to keep him
in custody while we check it out.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.657
Ah, you spelled
my name wrong.

12:22.692 --> 12:27.044
It's b-l-u-n-d-h-t.
Silent "h."

12:30.965 --> 12:33.784
Address?

12:35.119 --> 12:38.906
I strongly suggest you stop
eyeballin' me and tell me your address.

12:38.941 --> 12:42.660
17 prospect parkway.

12:42.695 --> 12:47.064
Martinsburg,
25401.

12:48.566 --> 12:52.403
All right, mr. Blund-ht.
Give me your phone number.

13:02.813 --> 13:05.900
What the hell?

13:13.240 --> 13:15.743
The "h" is silent.

13:19.079 --> 13:21.665
I could've sworn curtis
clocked out hours ago.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.000
He said good night to me
and everything.

13:24.035 --> 13:25.819
This morning i find him
shoved underneath the desk.

13:26.319 --> 13:30.924
Deputy, are you sure you don't
remember what happened last night?

13:31.925 --> 13:36.079
The guy cold-cocked me.
Except, he wasn't the guy.

13:36.114 --> 13:38.682
He was me.

13:41.434 --> 13:43.870
My head hurts.

13:49.442 --> 13:52.228
I found van blundht's clothes
in the locker room.

13:52.729 --> 13:54.981
He must've walked out of here
wearing the deputy's spare uniform.

13:55.016 --> 13:58.218
After hitting him
over the head.

13:58.253 --> 14:01.571
I have a theory.
Do you want to hear it?

14:01.606 --> 14:04.074
Van blundht somehow physically
transformed into his captor,

14:04.574 --> 14:06.576
then walked out the door
leaving no one the wiser?

14:06.611 --> 14:10.497
Should we be pickin' out
china patterns or what?

14:10.532 --> 14:12.499
Why can't you just
go for the simple answer?

14:12.999 --> 14:15.001
With that blow to the head, the
deputy might have identified...

14:15.036 --> 14:17.837
mcgruff the crime dog as his attacker.
What about what the sheriff saw?

14:17.872 --> 14:21.207
Two men, roughly the same build,
the same coloring,

14:21.242 --> 14:23.710
the addition of the uniform goes
a long way to explain how someone...

14:24.210 --> 14:26.713
can mistake one man for another
at 3:00 in the morning.

14:26.748 --> 14:29.149
Conversely, my theory goes
a long way to explaining...

14:29.184 --> 14:31.651
how four married women could mistake
van blundht for their husbands,

14:31.686 --> 14:35.238
and how amanda nelligan could
think he was luke skywalker.

14:35.273 --> 14:37.424
We've both seen something
like this before, scully.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.094
But what are you saying? That,
that van blundht is an alien?

14:41.129 --> 14:43.363
Not unless they have
trailer parks in space.

14:43.863 --> 14:45.615
No, this is
something different.

14:58.011 --> 15:01.014
Scully, if you could be somebody
else for a day, who would it be?

15:01.514 --> 15:03.016
Hopefully myself.

15:03.516 --> 15:04.934
So boring.

15:05.435 --> 15:08.188
Wouldn't you even be tempted to try
on somebody else's existence for a day?

15:08.223 --> 15:09.973
Live your life
as somebody else?

15:10.008 --> 15:13.977
Looking like someone else, and being
someone else are completely different things.

15:14.012 --> 15:17.480
Maybe it's not. Everybody else around you
would treat you like you were somebody else.

15:17.515 --> 15:21.284
Ultimately maybe it's other people's
reactions to us that make us who we are.

15:26.773 --> 15:30.276
All right then,
eleanor roosevelt.

15:33.279 --> 15:36.533
You can't be a dead
person. Why the hell not?

15:42.288 --> 15:44.290
Because.

15:46.292 --> 15:49.779
What are you doin'
sneakin' around my porch?

15:50.280 --> 15:54.417
We're with the f.b.i. Is this
the home of edward van blundht?

15:54.452 --> 15:57.687
Yeah, that's me. We're looking
for your son, eddie, junior.

15:57.722 --> 15:59.639
Eddie?

16:00.139 --> 16:03.393
What did that moron do now?

16:06.496 --> 16:09.716
Five women? Oh, lord!

16:09.751 --> 16:11.568
Anything else?

16:11.603 --> 16:15.788
Yes, he attacked
a sheriff's deputy...

16:15.823 --> 16:18.725
during his escape from custody. Hurt bad?

16:18.760 --> 16:23.613
Fortunately not. Well, thank
heavens for that at least.

16:23.648 --> 16:27.367
Sir, do you have any idea
where your son might be?

16:27.402 --> 16:32.789
I wish i did. I'm sorry. I haven't
seen him for the last two days.

16:32.824 --> 16:34.207
Is this...
is this you?

16:34.242 --> 16:37.660
One and the same.
Hey, you wanna see?

16:37.695 --> 16:40.980
No! No.

16:41.015 --> 16:43.199
No, thank you.

16:43.234 --> 16:47.337
My son had his removed
when he was, uh,

16:47.372 --> 16:50.707
just a kid.

16:50.742 --> 16:53.209
Kept buggin' me
and buggin' me...

16:53.244 --> 16:57.213
until i finally let him do it.

16:57.248 --> 16:59.048
There you go.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.734
I told him
it was a mistake.

17:01.769 --> 17:04.988
I said, "son, you ain't much
to look at.

17:05.022 --> 17:07.089
"You ain't no athlete...

17:07.125 --> 17:10.326
"and you sure the hell
ain't no einstein.

17:10.361 --> 17:13.329
"But at least
you got that tail.

17:13.364 --> 17:15.698
Otherwise, you're
just small potatoes."

17:15.733 --> 17:18.651
But he didn't listen.

17:18.685 --> 17:22.655
Sir, does your son have any
other unique medical conditions?

17:22.690 --> 17:24.941
I mean,
aside from the tail?

17:24.976 --> 17:27.694
Mr. Mulder,
that boy was born sickly.

17:27.729 --> 17:31.664
We used to have this condition
down in the south called pellagra.

17:31.699 --> 17:34.550
Excuse me, sir, how did you
know my name was mulder?

17:34.585 --> 17:36.519
She told me it was.

17:36.554 --> 17:38.972
Mmm, no,
actually i didn't.

17:43.242 --> 17:45.445
It's him!

18:09.368 --> 18:12.538
Pretty spry
for an old guy, huh?

18:12.573 --> 18:15.040
Eddie, junior.
Not senior?

18:15.075 --> 18:18.327
Whichever one he is, wouldn't
you say he's a man with a secret?

18:31.323 --> 18:34.877
Honey, what are you
doing home so early?

18:51.327 --> 18:54.697
That was daddy.
Something's wrong with daddy.

18:54.732 --> 18:57.149
Fred?

18:58.951 --> 19:02.988
Honey?
Fred, is everything okay?

19:05.424 --> 19:07.259
Everything's fine.

19:08.711 --> 19:11.046
What happened to the clothes
you were wearing this morning?

19:13.882 --> 19:15.884
L-i'll explain later.

19:15.919 --> 19:21.390
Just give me a little privacy,
okay, uh... babboo?

19:21.425 --> 19:23.776
Okay,

19:25.277 --> 19:27.780
sugar patootie.

19:41.226 --> 19:44.229
I'll check upstairs.

20:02.581 --> 20:05.584
I'm all right.
What?

20:23.685 --> 20:26.038
Oh!

20:27.039 --> 20:31.343
It's quicklime.
Move back over there.

20:34.246 --> 20:36.248
Back.

20:46.525 --> 20:49.027
Not so spry.

20:49.912 --> 20:53.398
Think the fall killed him?

20:56.735 --> 20:59.021
Babboo, i'm home.

20:59.056 --> 21:02.658
Oh, crap!
I'm home early.

21:02.693 --> 21:04.860
What?

21:04.895 --> 21:07.479
You were just here.

21:07.514 --> 21:11.233
You went into the bathroom.
What?

21:14.470 --> 21:19.074
Honey, what do you mean i went
into the bathroom? Shh, come here.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.734
Someone is in the bathroom.

21:51.423 --> 21:53.392
It's all clear.

22:14.980 --> 22:17.566
So, what killed
eddie the monkey man?

22:17.601 --> 22:19.568
It's difficult to say.

22:19.603 --> 22:22.571
The quicklime burned the
tissue even as it preserved it.

22:22.606 --> 22:27.576
So, what killed him is one of two
things i haven't figured out yet.

22:27.611 --> 22:30.495
What's the other thing?
That would be this.

22:36.118 --> 22:38.370
Striated muscle tissue.

22:38.405 --> 22:41.657
- What's unusual about that?
- In and of itself, nothing.

22:41.692 --> 22:45.043
Where i found it, however...
where did you find it?

22:45.078 --> 22:48.480
Everywhere.
His entire body.

22:48.515 --> 22:51.983
As far as i can tell, this man has a
thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue...

22:52.018 --> 22:55.487
underpinning the entire
dermal layer of his skin.

22:55.522 --> 23:00.258
That's not normal. This man's body
is quite a scientific specimen.

23:00.293 --> 23:02.761
And thankfully,
it's preserved and intact.

23:03.261 --> 23:06.765
In other words, there are
654 muscles in the human body,

23:06.800 --> 23:09.768
and this man,
essentially, has 655.

23:09.803 --> 23:14.523
Um, could that somehow be
related to his, uh, having a tail?

23:14.558 --> 23:17.526
Possibly. It could be, uh,
a lynx gene birth defect.

23:17.561 --> 23:22.848
What would be the, uh,
purpose of this muscle?

23:22.883 --> 23:26.468
You got me, mulder.
You know, maybe none.

23:26.503 --> 23:28.920
It appears to be atrophied.

23:28.955 --> 23:31.540
Although it may look that way
as a result of the mummification.

23:31.575 --> 23:35.360
Could this be, uh, a "like
father, like son" kind of thing?

23:35.395 --> 23:38.680
- What do you mean?
- Could eddie, junior have,

23:39.181 --> 23:41.516
the same anomalous muscular
structure as his dad here?

23:41.551 --> 23:43.919
Maybe.
What are you suggesting?

23:43.954 --> 23:47.906
If this musculature
underlies the entire skin,

23:47.941 --> 23:52.127
then maybe it could be utilized to
remold the skin's shape and texture,

23:52.162 --> 23:54.246
which would go a long way to explaining
why we're looking for a man...

23:54.281 --> 23:57.499
who can appear to be his own father,
or anyone else for that matter.

23:57.534 --> 24:01.870
Isn't it much more likely that this
man simply has an identical twin?

24:01.905 --> 24:06.057
- Check that out.
- Where are you going?

24:06.092 --> 24:08.927
Something about van blundht's
m.o. Confuses me.

24:08.962 --> 24:11.229
His victims were four married
women who wanted to get pregnant.

24:11.264 --> 24:14.433
- And one single woman
who didn't. - Mm-hmm.

24:21.757 --> 24:24.559
Come in.

24:24.594 --> 24:29.064
Sorry, ms. Nelligan. I'm sorry
to bother you. No, it's no bother.

24:29.099 --> 24:33.068
I just have a few additional
questions i wanted to ask you. Okay.

24:33.103 --> 24:36.071
Here we go, sweetie.
Bye, bye.

24:36.106 --> 24:38.406
We'll just
come back later.

24:38.441 --> 24:41.326
You know, i thought they were lettin'
me stay in the hospital so long...

24:41.827 --> 24:43.829
because i had really,
really great insurance.

24:44.329 --> 24:47.833
Turns out they're just keepin' me here
because they think i'm sort of crazy.

24:47.868 --> 24:52.320
They wanna make sure i'm
safe to be around my baby.

24:52.355 --> 24:54.706
Free cable.

24:58.143 --> 25:01.897
I want to ask you,
do you recognize this man?

25:01.932 --> 25:05.000
Oh, yes.
Eew!

25:05.035 --> 25:07.652
That's eddie van blundht.

25:07.687 --> 25:10.789
What can you tell me
about him?

25:10.824 --> 25:13.625
We went out
all through high school.

25:13.660 --> 25:16.878
Okay, brother.
What?

25:16.913 --> 25:19.080
Nothing. He's just...
he's sort of a loser.

25:19.115 --> 25:22.784
He's one of those guys you
look back on and you go,

25:22.819 --> 25:27.572
"oh, my god, what was i
thinking? What was i thinking?"

25:27.607 --> 25:32.260
Ah, well, what specifically
made him a loser?

25:32.295 --> 25:34.479
I don't know.
Everything.

25:34.514 --> 25:38.383
He had like one million
annoying personal habits.

25:38.418 --> 25:41.019
You know,
just no sense of romance,

25:41.054 --> 25:44.022
no ambition, you know,
no direction.

25:44.057 --> 25:47.025
I hear he's like a janitor
or somethin' now.

25:47.526 --> 25:51.012
He had this weird family. His
dad was in a circus or somethin'.

25:51.047 --> 25:55.016
I don't know. He never
let me meet him, thank god.

25:55.517 --> 25:59.521
Well, he must have had
some good qualities.

25:59.556 --> 26:01.489
Yeah, sure.
Everybody's got a few.

26:01.524 --> 26:04.309
We had some good times.

26:04.344 --> 26:07.229
He really lovedstar wars so we
used to go and see it every weekend.

26:07.264 --> 26:10.232
That was nice.
Hmm.

26:10.267 --> 26:12.500
He was no luke,
that's for sure.

26:14.753 --> 26:19.057
Why do you want
to know about eddie?

26:19.092 --> 26:21.309
That's official
f.b.i. Business.

26:21.344 --> 26:23.161
Wow.

26:25.597 --> 26:27.883
Here you go.

26:27.918 --> 26:32.787
I wanted to congratulate you
on this blessed event.

26:32.822 --> 26:34.623
Thank you!

26:41.463 --> 26:45.467
May the force be with you.

26:51.906 --> 26:54.826
Hello, there.

26:55.326 --> 26:59.330
I'm here to see amanda nelligan.
Just down the hall there.

27:06.004 --> 27:08.973
Come in.

27:11.242 --> 27:15.129
No, seriously though, why do
you want to know about eddie?

27:15.630 --> 27:19.017
- What about eddie?
- Why were you asking me all those questions about him?

27:24.989 --> 27:26.824
Mulder. Agent mulder, this is fred niemann.

27:26.859 --> 27:29.444
Is it okay for us
to get into our bathroom now?

27:29.479 --> 27:31.312
Excuse me, sir?

27:31.347 --> 27:33.882
I was hoping we could get into
our bathroom sometime this evening.

27:33.917 --> 27:36.684
You said the police were gonna come
by and dust it for fingerprints,

27:36.719 --> 27:39.187
but that was about four hours ago. Uh-huh.

27:39.222 --> 27:42.690
We want to help you catch this guy,
but i'm having a real hard time here.

27:43.191 --> 27:46.194
I mean, how exactly do you wind up
chasing the suspect into my bathroom?

27:46.229 --> 27:47.879
Don't forget the suit.
Yeah.

27:47.914 --> 27:50.748
And what do you need
with my charcoal suit?

27:50.783 --> 27:53.751
I'm sorry, mr. Niemann. I'm
gonna have to call you back.

27:53.786 --> 27:59.207
- Um, i was just here. Where did i go?
- Huh?

28:04.062 --> 28:06.564
There was a man.
He looked exactly like me.

28:06.599 --> 28:11.569
Did you see where he went? Down
the hall. The men's locker room.

28:11.604 --> 28:14.072
Thank you.

28:29.487 --> 28:31.990
Hey.
Hey.

28:33.491 --> 28:35.493
Van blundht.
Who?

28:35.528 --> 28:37.495
Don't think about it.
Get your hands up.

28:37.996 --> 28:39.497
Turn around.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.502
Keep 'em up there.

28:44.537 --> 28:47.005
Put your hands down now.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.925
If it's not you,
i apologize in advance.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.927
What are you doing?

28:52.962 --> 28:54.929
Pull your pants up.

29:08.009 --> 29:10.011
What?
What did i do now?

29:10.046 --> 29:13.014
You're the only ones here?
Yeah.

29:13.049 --> 29:17.518
I apologize. Only one of you is
the man i'm looking for. I hope.

29:17.553 --> 29:21.022
I gotta wait for some blood tests to come
back, then i'll release the other one.

29:21.057 --> 29:25.026
So just sit tight and relax.
Keep your clothes on, huh?

29:30.031 --> 29:32.033
Scully.
Yeah, hey, it's me.

29:32.068 --> 29:34.452
I think you should get down to
the hospital right away, okay?

29:34.952 --> 29:36.954
I'm on my way.
Good.

29:58.810 --> 30:02.363
You're a damn
good-looking man.

30:06.386 --> 30:09.787
You drew a gun on me.
You handcuffed me!

30:09.822 --> 30:12.290
I know what i did.
With my own handcuffs.

30:12.325 --> 30:14.292
I'm sorry. I have a
serious problem with that.

30:14.327 --> 30:16.711
I still don't understand. Do you
think we look like criminals to you?

30:16.746 --> 30:20.715
Exactly. What the hell was on
your mind? I said i was sorry.

30:20.750 --> 30:23.718
Am i done here? Yeah.
We got his description.

30:24.218 --> 30:27.221
Come on, guys.
What the hell happened?

30:27.256 --> 30:30.725
Van blundht surprised me. He
cold-cocked me, and then got away.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.727
Got a lead on him?
No.

30:32.762 --> 30:36.731
The local authorities are already on the
warpath for goin' after one of their own.

30:36.766 --> 30:38.733
They'll catch him
eventually.

30:38.768 --> 30:41.035
So what,
that's it for us?

30:41.070 --> 30:45.256
I know i dragged you out here, but i'm
beginning to think this is just a waste of time.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.575
Now you think
there's no x-file here?

30:47.610 --> 30:50.511
No. No.

30:50.546 --> 30:55.016
I, i think the only thing that's
here is, uh, small potatoes.

31:24.112 --> 31:26.614
Hello?

31:26.649 --> 31:30.118
Hello!

31:30.618 --> 31:32.537
Get me out of here!

31:34.189 --> 31:37.192
Hello! Hello!

31:37.227 --> 31:39.194
Down here!

31:41.496 --> 31:45.099
Help! Help!

32:10.775 --> 32:12.527
Which one of you
wrote this?

32:12.562 --> 32:14.629
I did, sir.

32:16.547 --> 32:18.833
You spelled federal bureau
of investigation wrong.

32:18.868 --> 32:21.202
It was a typo.

32:21.237 --> 32:23.521
Twice.

32:26.107 --> 32:29.310
Agent scully, what about the body you
found? Did you establish a cause of death?

32:29.345 --> 32:33.631
Yes, sir. The subject, edward van
blundht, sr., died of natural causes.

32:33.666 --> 32:36.634
Specifically heart disease
and advanced age.

32:36.669 --> 32:39.637
We think the son hid the father in
the attic so he could continue...

32:39.672 --> 32:43.891
to cash in on the old man's social
security checks. Most likely.

32:43.926 --> 32:46.010
So, the son
wasn't a murderer.

32:46.045 --> 32:49.330
- No, not at all.
- But he was a rapist.

32:49.365 --> 32:52.817
I entered him into the national
sex offenders data base.

32:52.852 --> 32:55.453
The west virginia state police
have a photo and a description,

32:55.488 --> 32:58.456
and they will coordinate
with local authorities.

32:58.491 --> 33:01.509
There should be an arrest soon.

33:01.544 --> 33:04.295
That about wraps it up.

33:10.635 --> 33:14.138
So, scully, what are you doin'
tonight? Any big plans?

33:14.639 --> 33:17.642
Seeing as how it's friday, i was
thinking i could get some work in...

33:17.677 --> 33:21.646
on that monograph i'm writing
for thepenology review.

33:21.681 --> 33:25.650
You know, diminished acetylcholine
production in recidivist offenders.

33:25.685 --> 33:27.652
Uh-huh.

33:27.687 --> 33:31.155
Actually, i might bag that, though. Really?

33:31.190 --> 33:34.659
Yeah. I have to say, the anomalous
musculature in the corpse we found...

33:35.159 --> 33:37.178
really has me intrigued.

33:37.213 --> 33:40.715
In fact, i think i'm going to go to
quantico and have some tissue samples run.

33:40.750 --> 33:43.835
I'll see you monday.

33:43.870 --> 33:45.636
Monday morning.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.803
"Fox"?
Brother!

34:42.493 --> 34:44.712
Good night!

34:44.746 --> 34:47.215
This is where
my tax dollars go?

34:50.217 --> 34:52.219
Where do i live?

35:08.703 --> 35:11.205
Where the hell
do i sleep?

35:19.749 --> 35:22.216
Mulder? Langley.
You gotta see this.

35:22.251 --> 35:24.719
An on-line associate of ours,
who will remain anonymous,

35:24.754 --> 35:27.722
has figured out a way to digitize the
zagruder footage so he can extrapolate...

35:28.222 --> 35:32.226
a bird's-eye view at the daley plaza at
the exact moment of the assassination.

35:32.261 --> 35:34.228
And you'll never believe
where the third shot came from.

35:34.263 --> 35:36.230
tell him about the cheese steaks. oh, yeah.

35:36.265 --> 35:41.235
Frohike, byers and me are goin' out for
cheese steaks. Are you down with that?

35:41.270 --> 35:43.738
Uh, erase this
once you hear it.

35:43.773 --> 35:45.656
Geeks for friends.

35:46.157 --> 35:49.660
Marty, it's chantal. It's been
so long since we've spoken,

35:49.695 --> 35:53.164
and i've been so lonely
not hearing your sexy voice.

35:53.664 --> 35:56.667
Marty, just for you, we've lowered
our rates to 40 cents a minute,

35:56.702 --> 36:00.671
two ninety-nine for the first
minute, all long distance rates apply.

36:00.706 --> 36:04.175
Do give me a call, lover man.
I'll be waiting.

36:08.312 --> 36:09.814
F.b.i.

36:09.849 --> 36:15.269
F... b... i.

36:19.023 --> 36:21.025
F.b.i.

36:25.830 --> 36:28.332
You lookin' at me?

36:30.334 --> 36:33.838
There ain't nobody else here.
You must be lookin' at me.

36:35.339 --> 36:37.675
You want a piece of this?

36:59.897 --> 37:02.900
You're a damn good-lookin' man.

37:32.313 --> 37:37.618
Mulder, what's up?
Scully, is this a bad time?

37:37.653 --> 37:41.038
No. No, i'm...
come on in.

37:44.976 --> 37:46.978
Who's that for?

37:48.980 --> 37:51.482
Uh... us.

37:56.988 --> 38:00.141
Okay, have a seat.

38:08.699 --> 38:10.952
So, uh,
what are you workin' on?

38:10.987 --> 38:13.387
More autopsy data.

38:15.706 --> 38:19.210
Everyone at the lab found mr.
Van blundht pretty fascinating.

38:21.078 --> 38:27.101
We discovered an additional anomaly
relating to the hair follicles in his scalp.

38:27.136 --> 38:30.605
I can't even begin to guess
at the nature of it...

38:30.640 --> 38:33.608
until we can run it through the
transmission electron microscope.

38:34.992 --> 38:38.179
Sounds very interesting.

38:38.214 --> 38:40.264
Yes, it is.

38:51.275 --> 38:53.778
Seriously, mulder.
What's going on?

38:54.278 --> 38:57.782
You okay?
Mmm.

38:58.282 --> 39:01.285
Just kinda knockin' around,

39:01.320 --> 39:06.290
and was just thinkin'...

39:06.325 --> 39:09.210
Uh, it's good.

39:09.710 --> 39:12.213
We never really, uh,

39:12.248 --> 39:14.549
talk much,

39:14.584 --> 39:18.886
do we? What do you mean?
Like... really talk?

39:19.887 --> 39:21.889
No, no, we don't, mulder.

39:23.307 --> 39:25.309
What's stopping us?

39:35.653 --> 39:37.655
So there we are
at 2:00 in the morning,

39:37.690 --> 39:42.059
me in my moray taffeta dress and marcus
in whatever the hell he was wearing...

39:42.094 --> 39:44.495
thank you very much.

39:44.530 --> 39:49.500
It had a kelly green
cummerbund on it.

39:49.535 --> 39:53.888
Anyway, so i know that marcus is
thinking that it's now or never.

39:53.923 --> 39:58.192
And i'm thinking...
what are you thinking?

39:58.227 --> 40:01.879
I'm thinking what is that siren
i hear getting louder? No way!

40:01.914 --> 40:05.266
Who called the cops? It wasn't the
cops. It was the fire department.

40:05.301 --> 40:08.603
My friend sylvia and her
idiot prom date... burwood?

40:08.638 --> 40:12.390
Had built this campfire that
went totally out of control.

40:12.425 --> 40:15.393
And so we all had to ride back
on the, uh...

40:15.893 --> 40:18.195
what do you call it?
The, uh, the pumper truck.

40:18.230 --> 40:21.082
Geez.

40:21.117 --> 40:25.853
Yeah. Marcus was the twelfth
grade love of my life.

40:25.888 --> 40:28.856
I can't believe
i'm telling you this.

40:28.891 --> 40:31.542
I don't believe you
haven't told me before.

40:31.577 --> 40:34.195
Now i'm seeing a whole
new side of you, mulder.

40:34.230 --> 40:38.332
Is that a good thing?

40:40.051 --> 40:41.552
I like it.

40:43.504 --> 40:45.256
Do you ever wish things
were different?

40:45.291 --> 40:46.941
What do you mean?

40:49.827 --> 40:53.130
The person you wanted to be when you
grew up, when you were in high school?

40:53.165 --> 40:56.534
How far off from that
did you end up?

40:56.569 --> 40:58.536
Career wise?
Miles off target.

40:59.036 --> 41:00.871
Not just that.

41:01.322 --> 41:03.808
But do you ever wish...

41:03.843 --> 41:07.094
that you could go back
and do it all differently?

41:08.312 --> 41:09.613
Do you?

42:16.130 --> 42:17.998
Thanks for comin'.

42:18.033 --> 42:21.335
What's with the hat?

42:21.370 --> 42:24.238
My court-appointed therapist
makes me wear it.

42:24.273 --> 42:26.741
She says it's meant
to bolster my self-esteem.

42:26.776 --> 42:28.509
Does it?

42:28.544 --> 42:32.947
Not really. The other inmates
beat me up and take it from me,

42:32.982 --> 42:35.449
which would be okay except every
week she brings me a new hat.

42:36.851 --> 42:40.204
Plus, they keep me on
some kind of muscle relaxant...

42:40.704 --> 42:44.708
so i, i can't make faces
the way i used to.

42:44.743 --> 42:47.511
Did you tell them to do that?

42:48.429 --> 42:52.133
Is, uh, is agent scully here?

42:52.168 --> 42:54.385
What did you wanna
talk to me about, eddie?

42:54.420 --> 42:57.321
I just think it's funny.

42:57.356 --> 43:00.207
I was born a loser,
but you're one by choice.

43:00.242 --> 43:03.160
On what do you base
that astute assessment?

43:03.195 --> 43:05.029
Experience.

43:07.531 --> 43:12.036
You should live a little.
Treat yourself.

43:12.071 --> 43:15.673
God knows i would
if i were you.

43:35.109 --> 43:37.611
Have a good day, sir.

43:41.115 --> 43:46.120
I don't imagine you need to be told
this, mulder, but you're not a loser.

43:50.124 --> 43:54.628
Yeah, but i'm no eddie
van blundht, either, am i?

44:37.670 --> 44:40.240
I made this.
