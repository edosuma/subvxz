WEBVTT

00:27.777 --> 00:30.196
Step on the gas, fucker! Speed up!

00:53.845 --> 00:55.555
One man down! Send back-up.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.140
They're on the 26.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.244
Relax.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.246
It's over.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.212
The Americans sent those motherfuckers.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.214
Shall we head to the mountains?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.678
No, head to Culiacan.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.118
It's clear.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.082
They wanted to kill us.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.377
Relax, we'll be safe here.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.463
We'll spend the night here.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.675
Take her to one
of the other houses tomorrow.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.802
We'll disappear the trucks.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.264
-Another house?
-I can't go to ours.

02:20.598 --> 02:24.018
If you're on the DEA's radar,
they'll be watching you to get to me.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.859
Everything's gonna be OK, you'll see.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.361
Go to bed so you can rest.

02:35.530 --> 02:39.576
I don't want them to kill you, Joaquin.
I don't want you to be killed or caught.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.036
Hide in the mountains,
just like Bravo said.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.913
Deep in the mountains.
You won't be found.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.373
No need to.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.959
I'll solve this.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.754
You trust me?

02:53.464 --> 02:55.425
Then don't worry, I'll handle this.

03:14.193 --> 03:18.156
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

03:18.740 --> 03:22.869
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

03:22.994 --> 03:26.956
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:27.624 --> 03:33.630
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

03:33.713 --> 03:36.841
Even when the clouds drift away

03:37.926 --> 03:41.554
Even when my skin dries away

03:42.305 --> 03:45.850
I'll be back someday

03:46.851 --> 03:50.980
To unleash my return

03:55.526 --> 03:59.447
I have the dust that protects the road

03:59.697 --> 04:03.826
I have the branches of a leafless tree

04:04.535 --> 04:08.498
I'm the guardian of the tired night

04:08.706 --> 04:14.754
There are silhouettes that
come to meet me

04:15.380 --> 04:19.634
Even when the clouds drift away

04:19.717 --> 04:22.679
Even when my skin dries away

04:23.721 --> 04:27.392
I'll be back someday

04:28.518 --> 04:32.397
To unleash my return

04:41.489 --> 04:44.200
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE
MEXICO CITY

04:54.294 --> 04:57.922
Your government's image has been affected
by your war on drug trafficking.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.135
Mr. President, arresting El Chapo

05:03.219 --> 05:04.804
is the boost you need

05:05.013 --> 05:08.349
if you want your party
to win the next elections.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.330
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY
MEXICO CITY

05:32.248 --> 05:36.002
The number you dialed
is currently off or out of coverage.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.837
We suggest...

05:38.046 --> 05:39.672
Change that shit's chip.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.216
Put one on we haven't used before.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.553
Sir? We're ready.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.181
-Elba!
-Ready, sir.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.271
Bravo will take you to the new house.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.357
When will we see each other again?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.903
In a couple of days,
when I fix everything.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.946
In the meantime,
don't go out on the streets.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.783
If you need anything,
ask them to get it for you.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.415
Take care.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.054
Yes?

06:28.888 --> 06:31.933
-The navy attacked by DEA's orders?
-The DEA and the government.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.560
Things have changed, Joaquin.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.229
Right now, I can't explain.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.980
The army is after you.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.399
There's an operative
on the way to Culiacan.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.944
-How do I know you're not lying?
-You don't.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.946
You have to trust me.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.615
You have an hour, leave the city.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.617
Call me once you're safe.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.497
Let's go. Soldiers are on their way.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.667
Tell Bravo,
so he can tell the rest to hide.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.937
ROAD TO CULIACAN, MEXICO

08:24.962 --> 08:27.173
Your president forgot we have a deal.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.092
You crossed the line with the DEA.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.386
I warned you not to mess with them.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.097
Why did you tell me about the army?

08:35.932 --> 08:37.683
What do you get if they don't catch me?

08:39.185 --> 08:41.312
I have a deal with the opposing party.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.982
If Esteban Prieto wins the elections,

08:46.067 --> 08:48.152
I'll be Secretary of State.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.699
You're back where you began, the PTI.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.577
It's no good for me if this government

08:56.661 --> 08:59.455
gets a boost of popularity
by capturing you.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.919
You can count with my money and whatever
you need to support your candidate.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.755
In exchange, I want my deals respected
once he wins.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.924
No arrests, and most importantly...

09:10.174 --> 09:12.093
no danger of extradition.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.428
What matters now, is you don't get caught.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.598
I'll keep you posted
on the army's operatives.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.601
I'll help you out
with the federal police as well.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.937
I can't help you out
with the navy, though.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.314
They coordinate with the DEA,
you know that.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.317
-I have no access to that information.
-Don't worry.

09:28.609 --> 09:29.944
I'll take care of the navy.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.613
I'll need to do some impounds as well.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.991
Some arrests, as usual,

09:35.491 --> 09:38.619
for the president and the DEA to think
I'm really after you.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.079
Done.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.375
It's convenient for me, as well,
that you become Secretary of Government.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.005
It all depends on you
not getting caught, Joaquin.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.383
Until the elections, your true enemies
are the Americans,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.678
and the navy. Stay safe.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.457
The government and the Americans
want my head.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.794
We won't let that put a stop
to our growth.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.173
Conrado's on our side,
that's an advantage.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.009
The international side was hit
with Mayel's arrest.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.970
The DEA is fucking with our shipments.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.014
Our people are handling that,

10:40.514 --> 10:42.433
to keep the shipment going.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.938
Damaso, I want you in charge
of Navolato and Los Cabos.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.776
With their location, those territories
are off the radar and could be useful.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.695
Quino, you'll take care of Villa Juarez.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.989
And you, you're going to the mountains?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.991
No, I'll stay in Culiacan.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.660
This is my house.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.245
Nowhere else will I be as safe as here.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.290
My only problem, now, is the navy.

11:06.457 --> 11:09.335
I gotta fix that
to get things back to normal.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.906
-Hi.
-Hello.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.326
What's that?

11:44.453 --> 11:46.622
A present from my friend,
Elizabeth Larrea.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.001
-It's a jewel, right?
-It's a sham.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.380
If you want to hang that,
do it in the hallway.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.714
Come on, Conrado.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.008
How can we put a Melendez in the hallway?

11:58.384 --> 12:01.929
I don't follow painters for their name,
but for their taste.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.015
That thing, personally, is

12:05.808 --> 12:07.685
a fraud for rich people.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.272
He's been compared
with Picasso and Tamayo.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.567
If you don't like it,
it's because you don't understand it.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.364
I don't like it
because it's a monstrosity.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.325
From now on, we'll be receiving guests.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.412
We need to make a good impression.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.291
That's what a Melendez does.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.170
Good impressions, Berta,
are earned with intelligence.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.089
Not by hanging a painting on a wall.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.259
If it was about intelligence,

12:40.676 --> 12:42.720
you and I would be presidents by now.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.682
Unfortunately, image is of importance
as well.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.019
That's the game, Conrado.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.313
If you wanna reach the top,

12:53.355 --> 12:54.899
you gotta know how to play.

12:56.150 --> 12:59.528
If our guests want to see the Melendez,
they can see it in the hallway.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.336
Good night.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.421
Good night.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.725
MEXICO CITY

13:35.439 --> 13:38.526
RODRIGO VIÑAS, GENERAL COORDINATOR
OF NAVY OPERATIONS

14:11.475 --> 14:13.227
Excuse me, Mr. Viñas.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.980
The principal needs to talk to you.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.942
-Is it urgent?
-It's to see if your son

14:20.067 --> 14:21.902
can get onto the swimming team.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.904
It won't take long.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.491
-Let's go.
-Follow me, please.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.334
It's done, sir.
Target's been secured.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.670
Take him to the meeting point.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.340
Let's go.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.487
Rodrigo Viñas.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.822
I apologize for dragging you here
like this.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.367
Take his cuffs off.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.330
Would you like anything to drink?

15:56.830 --> 15:58.207
No, thank you.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.709
You're doing a great job.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.920
The navy's got me by the balls.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.297
He also had me by the balls before.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.383
He was special forces,

16:07.925 --> 16:09.969
in charge of capturing me, and now...

16:11.387 --> 16:13.305
he's one of my most trusted men.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.475
I like to trust people.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.688
You can get anything you want with force.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.899
But with intelligent men like yourself,

16:24.692 --> 16:26.360
I'd rather have things go smooth.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.364
That's why I came here,
to talk face to face.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.367
I'm offering you a chance.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.538
I appreciate that.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.291
I'm where I'm at because I know how to
take advantage of opportunities.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.170
Very well, Viñas. Lopez...

16:46.046 --> 16:47.798
get Rodrigo a beer.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.635
I'm offering you $25,000,000 pesos
in exchange for information.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.267
I wanna know about the navy's operations
before they're on me.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.810
Agreed?

17:04.606 --> 17:06.025
Agreed.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.193
Enjoy your beer.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.071
My men will explain all the details.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.415
When you have information,
call that number.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.500
Ask for Fausto.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.129
Use the word "fishermen"
there are $10,000,000 there.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.216
You'll get the rest once you start
blowing the whistle.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.968
Any questions?

17:38.891 --> 17:42.352
As a part of our fight
against drug trafficking,

17:42.644 --> 17:46.023
once again we have hit the Sinaloa Cartel.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.277
This is just a sample of the huge amount
of weapons and drugs seized

17:50.652 --> 17:54.656
by the Federal Police in Sonora at dawn.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.658
Questions?

17:56.742 --> 17:59.203
Mr. Secretary, Omar Pardo
from El Popular newspaper.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.579
Go on.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.791
How do you explain that the head
of the cartel, El Chapo Guzman,

18:03.874 --> 18:05.793
is still a fugitive after nine years?

18:06.710 --> 18:08.712
He's a powerful drug lord.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.632
That's why these operatives are important.

18:12.591 --> 18:16.720
They weaken his structure
and get us closer to capturing him.

18:17.221 --> 18:20.224
You've had key positions
in the last two administrations,

18:20.808 --> 18:23.560
the same amount of time Guzman Loera
has been a fugitive.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.063
Do you take any responsibility
before the people?

18:27.940 --> 18:31.610
I'm sure the people remember
that during these two administrations,

18:31.902 --> 18:34.738
the Avendaños, the brothers Bernal Leyda,

18:35.197 --> 18:37.533
Vicente Castillo,
leader of the Juarez Cartel,

18:37.658 --> 18:41.078
-and many others have gone down...
-Excuse me, but not El Chapo Guzman.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.664
What's your take on the rumors
that link you with him?

18:43.831 --> 18:45.666
False accusations, of course.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.709
Next question.

18:48.127 --> 18:52.256
Pardon me, you were accused of giving him
protection on several signs,

18:52.339 --> 18:53.966
Mr. Secretary.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.760
Accused without proof.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.722
I said it that time,
I'll repeat it again.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.351
Those are false accusations.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.771
I have nothing to do

19:08.188 --> 19:11.191
with the drug lord
known as El Chapo Guzman.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.569
Excuse me.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.908
Make sure that journalist doesn't cover
my press conferences again.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.118
Yes, sir.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.955
EL POPULAR NEWSPAPER

19:37.718 --> 19:40.971
THE SECRETARY STATES THAT HE WANTS TO END
DELINQUENCY WHEN HE COVERS UP

19:41.054 --> 19:43.807
JOAQUIN GUZMAN LOERA (EL CHAPO) ISMAEL
ZAMBRANO. IS THIS THE WAR AGAINST CRIME?

19:43.891 --> 19:46.560
CONRADO SOL, IF YOU WANT TO PUT AN END
TO THE INSECURITY, DON'T PROTECT EL CHAPO.

19:51.732 --> 19:55.444
CHAPO YOU WON'T DEFEAT US, EVEN WITH
THE MILITARY AND THE FEDS ON YOUR SIDE.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.362
INTIMATE ENEMIES? EL CHAPO GUZMAN AND
CONRADO SOL RUMORS OF A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP

20:41.657 --> 20:43.283
Hello, Conrado.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.994
Nice to meet you.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.925
The ex-president told me
I can trust you.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.386
You're not the first person he sends me.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.221
You'll never know who they are.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.890
They'll never know about your visits.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.315
OPEN

22:18.295 --> 22:19.796
No!

23:06.760 --> 23:08.428
I'll call you.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.780
How's your married life treating you?

23:27.989 --> 23:29.032
It's bearable.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.785
-Will you stick with it?
-If I could deal with you...

23:31.952 --> 23:34.955
-I can deal with anyone.
-Well, it wasn't for that long.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.332
Otherwise, we wouldn't have divorced.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.793
You're the one who couldn't deal
with it anymore.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.045
You couldn't bear my political ambitions.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.047
Not by sacrificing family.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.884
Why are we talking about this, Miguel?

23:48.051 --> 23:50.095
I don't know, the habit, maybe.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.640
I understand we're not getting
back together.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.601
You need sex, just like everybody else.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.395
I'm the one you chose.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.567
At first, I thought it would be a bad idea
to choose you.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.443
My godfather was right, though.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.156
If I have to trust someone
with my infidelities,

24:09.573 --> 24:12.659
it's better to be with someone
who's always been loyal.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.124
GOVERNING OFFICE

INTIMATE ENEMIES? EL CHAPO GUZMAN, CONRADO
SOL, RUMORS OF A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP

24:35.432 --> 24:37.309
THE SECRETARY COVERS UP JOAQUIN LOERA,
ISMAEL ZAMBRANO IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY

24:37.392 --> 24:38.852
IS THIS THE WAR AGAINST CRIME?

24:52.073 --> 24:54.284
-Yes?
-Esteban? This is Olivares.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.286
I'm sorry for calling this early.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.121
No, it's not that early. Go ahead.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.582
You have time for a meeting?

25:02.000 --> 25:06.504
I need to talk about your possible
Secretary of Government.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.382
INTIMATE ENEMIES?

25:11.676 --> 25:13.762
FAUSTO'S HARDWARE STORE
MEXICO CITY

25:19.893 --> 25:22.646
-Yes?
-I need to talk to Fausto.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.522
It's about the fishermen.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.317
This is Fausto, what about the fishermen?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.986
They're gonna fish in Navolato.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.364
You have around an hour.

25:32.906 --> 25:33.865
Got it.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.795
Fishermen on their way.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.554
Sir...

25:59.224 --> 26:01.768
Viñas said there will be an
operation in Navolato.

26:01.851 --> 26:03.228
Go there.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.148
I want you to verify if the source
is trustworthy or not.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.210
Anchor.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.480
Sir...

26:56.364 --> 26:58.950
Tell Fausto to give the coordinator
his dough.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.788
-Confirmed, you'll get the package.
-Thank you, Fausto.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.333
We'll be in touch.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.850
Thanks for your cooperation.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.567
On your behalf and that of Sol,
the best thing to do

27:32.650 --> 27:35.403
is to establish a commission
to investigate in the senate.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.280
You think that's necessary?

27:37.864 --> 27:40.700
This is a minor newspaper,
its print run is limited.

27:41.493 --> 27:45.205
The opposition will do whatever it takes
to take you down, Esteban.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.083
It will be a feast for them

27:48.166 --> 27:51.169
that your man in the government
is linked with criminals.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.005
There couldn't be any doubts about...

27:56.257 --> 27:58.259
I have a deal with the former president.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.886
He'll understand that

27:59.969 --> 28:02.931
we don't need the slightest shade
of corruption linked with me.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.307
Right.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.393
You got nothing to lose.

28:06.601 --> 28:09.687
If he comes out clean,
it would be better for all of us.

28:09.938 --> 28:13.191
If they find anything, cut ties
so he can't drag you down with him.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.818
And you take his position.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.571
Please, Olivares.

28:18.905 --> 28:22.325
It's completely clear you're not only
interested in protecting my image.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.453
I consider myself an option only

28:25.662 --> 28:28.873
if Conrado is a nuance
for the campaign, of course.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.045
Proceed with the investigation.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.299
I'll talk with Alvaro, Hidalgo's
representative, to present the motion.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.198
What are you doing here?

29:05.201 --> 29:07.537
I told you I was gonna take care of it,
didn't I?

29:07.996 --> 29:09.372
Aren't they after you?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.166
Everything's under control.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.563
Good afternoon.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.565
-Hi.
-Can it be fixed?

29:40.653 --> 29:42.197
Gimme a second.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.499
Freeze.

29:55.084 --> 29:56.377
What is it?

29:56.544 --> 29:59.631
From now on,
you're a DEA collaborator, Fausto.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.718
If you refuse, you'll be arrested
and extradited right away.

30:05.261 --> 30:08.014
We received the request
from Hidalgo's colleague

30:08.097 --> 30:09.098
CONGRESS
MEXICO CITY

30:09.182 --> 30:12.018
to form an investigative commission.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.354
Go ahead, Mr. Congressman.

30:14.646 --> 30:19.234
This article once again opens up
the questions surrounding Conrado Sol,

30:20.151 --> 30:22.320
Secretary of Public Safety,

30:22.445 --> 30:24.280
which began a few years back.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.909
PUBLIC SAFETY

30:31.454 --> 30:34.582
Berta
Check the congress channel, urgent.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.632
It's true that there is
no proof against him.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.968
But due to the importance of his position,

30:45.301 --> 30:47.720
and the gravity of the rumors,

30:48.596 --> 30:51.933
we request an investigative commission
be established.

30:52.350 --> 30:56.646
Impartial and that digs deep
into the rumors

30:56.771 --> 30:59.274
that link him
with Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.995
I won't deny I'm surprised, Esteban.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.163
We're looking to give the PTI a new image,

31:14.330 --> 31:16.666
and nothing can damage it.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.501
Of course.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.921
I understand it's all for the
benefit of the party.

31:22.130 --> 31:25.633
Besides that, I have no doubts
Conrado will come out clean.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.344
I agree, I have no doubts either.

31:28.761 --> 31:32.432
Believe me, once those rumors
are completely cleared,

31:32.557 --> 31:35.935
it will be my pleasure to have him
as Secretary of State.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.272
So it will be. Greetings, Esteban.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.940
Thanks for calling.

31:49.157 --> 31:53.244
We'll continue voting, to see if the
investigative commission is approved.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.204
Your turn, congresswoman.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.583
We'll understand, by obvious reasons,
if you choose to abstain.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.877
Not at all, Mr. President.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.629
I trust my husband.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.089
I vote for the investigation
to be approved.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.486
Conrado, come with Berta tonight.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.238
We have to solve the situation.

32:39.499 --> 32:43.002
LAS PALMAS RESTAURANT

32:58.309 --> 33:00.228
Don't do anything stupid.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.157
You don't know how badly
I wanted to leave the house.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.451
You weren't even there for long.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.704
The time I spent there was enough.

33:17.787 --> 33:20.206
I felt like a bird in a cage.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.835
Most of all, I miss you.
I don't like it when you're gone.

33:24.043 --> 33:26.295
Well, you won't miss me anymore.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.924
I'm here and I'm here to stay.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.235
What is it?

33:49.318 --> 33:51.696
Fishermen will get to Culiacan
in 40 minutes.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.824
The high tide is coming from the south.

33:55.241 --> 33:58.077
Calzada De Las Americas Avenue
is free towards the north.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.080
Got it.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.832
The vehicles.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.845
Sir...

34:18.056 --> 34:20.725
-What is it, Bravo?
-The navy is on its way.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.268
What is it?

34:23.436 --> 34:26.105
We'll have to eat dessert later,
sweetheart.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.399
Let's go.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.915
I gotta hide for a couple of hours.
I'll see you later.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.125
-Will you be OK?
-Don't worry.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.462
This means things are working out.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.843
Go!

35:49.814 --> 35:51.315
Fuck.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.318
He told me they were coming
from the south.

36:01.742 --> 36:04.787
It's a trap.
Viñas double-crossed us.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.582
Good evening.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.304
Flee, sir.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.016
No.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.185
They made sure we came this way.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.312
They're ready to jump on us.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.065
We need a distraction.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.447
Listen up. We need back-up.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.284
We're on the way.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.036
Move! Move! Move!

36:45.745 --> 36:47.371
Go now!

37:28.371 --> 37:30.539
Move slowly,
don't attract their attention.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.948
We gotta check the vehicle.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.992
Get out of the car, now.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.037
Lower the windows.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.248
Lower the windows, now!

38:21.299 --> 38:23.050
Go now!

38:40.276 --> 38:43.154
That asshole Olivares
wants the secretary position for himself.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.905
No doubt about it.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.033
For now, he got what he wanted.

38:47.450 --> 38:51.245
The investigative commission has been
approved, there's nothing we can do.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.999
It was brilliant that you voted in favor.

38:55.916 --> 38:58.627
Gives an idea that Conrado
has nothing to hide.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.755
They won't find anything.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.175
I've covered my tracks well.

39:05.384 --> 39:06.969
It's still dangerous, though.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.889
If you look closely, you'll find cracks.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.184
We gotta make sure
the investigation is favorable.

39:13.893 --> 39:17.146
If not, Esteban will have all the means
to kick you out of the game.

39:17.229 --> 39:20.441
Then, you can forget
about being Secretary of State,

39:20.941 --> 39:22.693
and a future presidency.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.633
Ma'am?

39:48.677 --> 39:50.137
Come in.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.517
Has Joaquin arrived?

39:54.934 --> 39:57.853
No ma'am, he wanted to tell you
he's not gonna make it.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.816
He's gotta hide, he's not coming
to Culiacan for a while.

40:34.890 --> 40:36.350
Enter through there.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.440
Only the ones who lived in these
mountains know where the access is.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.443
We're gonna be safe here
until we can go back to Culiacan.

41:02.751 --> 41:04.753
