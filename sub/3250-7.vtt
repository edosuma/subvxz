WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.132
This little girl, it's all about her.

00:03.212 --> 00:04.555
Who was she?

00:04.630 --> 00:07.474
Doctor, what is happening to her?

00:07.549 --> 00:09.267
Contractions.

00:09.301 --> 00:11.429
- Contractions?
- She's going into labour.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.055
Breathe.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.857
I needed enough information
to block the signal to the Flesh.

00:15.933 --> 00:16.934
What signal?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.189
The signal to you.

00:18.268 --> 00:21.238
- Rory, I don't like this.
- Stand away from her, Row.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.198
We're coming for you, I swear.

00:23.273 --> 00:29.155
And whatever happens, however hard,
however far, we will find you.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.410
I'm right here.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.791
No, you're not.

00:34.493 --> 00:39.465
And you haven't been
for a long, long time.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.428
You're ready to pop, aren't you?

01:00.227 --> 01:02.275
I wish I could tell you
that you'll be loved.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.949
That you'll be safe and cared for
and protected.

01:07.818 --> 01:10.071
But this isn't a time for lies.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.124
What you are going to be, Melody,

01:19.288 --> 01:20.961
is very, very brave.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.293
Two minutes.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.004
But not as brave as they'll have to be,

01:27.087 --> 01:28.339
because there's someone's coming.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.222
I don't know where he is
or what he's doing

01:33.051 --> 01:36.055
but trust me, he's on his way.

01:49.693 --> 01:53.288
Intruder, level nine. Seal level nine.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.993
There's a man
who's never going to let us down.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.330
And not even an army can get in the way.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.965
Leave her. Just you leave her.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.800
Please, leave her!

02:12.883 --> 02:14.931
Please, leave her!

02:15.636 --> 02:21.188
Intruder level 77.
Seal levels 72, 73 and 74.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.941
Intrude; level 75.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.738
He's the last of his kind.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.037
He looks young but he's lived for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

02:35.739 --> 02:39.744
And wherever they take you, Melody,
however scared you are,

02:40.535 --> 02:42.003
I promise you,

02:43.580 --> 02:45.548
you will never be alone.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.229
Because this man is your father.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.853
Prepare to engage.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.523
He has a name, but the people
of our world know him better...

03:08.980 --> 03:11.449
as the Last Centurion.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.493
I have a message and a question.

03:14.778 --> 03:18.999
A message from the Doctor
and a question from me.

03:19.074 --> 03:22.578
Where is my wife?

03:25.414 --> 03:27.917
Oh, don't give me those blank looks.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.597
The Twelfth Cyber Legion
monitors this entire quadrant.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.891
You hear everything.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.563
So, you tell me what I need to know.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.350
You tell me now and I'll be on my way.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.644
What is the Doctor's message?

03:57.946 --> 03:59.789
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

04:49.331 --> 04:51.129
A whole cyber legion, though,

04:51.208 --> 04:53.302
he just blew them all up
to make a point!

04:53.376 --> 04:55.754
We're being paid
to fight him, not praise him.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.805
Praising costs way more.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.555
Level minus-23 transept.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.690
Digger says he once
chased the Atraxi off a planet

05:06.765 --> 05:08.483
then called them back for a scolding.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.107
Fight him, not praise him.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.780
Alert.
This base is on yellow alert.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.607
This base is on yellow alert.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.614
Is she sewing?

05:18.693 --> 05:21.162
She's on her break,
she can do what she likes.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.616
Now, try again.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.959
That one.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.914
No that's the psychic.
You got to look for the fractals.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.842
Don't look bored, we're on yellow alert.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.716
We've been on yellow alert
for three weeks.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.350
Reminder.
Do not interact with Headless Monks

05:41.383 --> 05:43.056
without divine permission.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.479
Do not interact with Headless Monks
without divine permission.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.398
We're not supposed to stare at them.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.976
And if they think we're trying to see
under their hoods, they'll kill you.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.060
On the spot.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.443
Why are they called the Headless Monks?
They can't really be headless.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.991
They believe
the domain of faith is the heart

05:58.066 --> 05:59.693
and the domain of doubt is the head.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.366
They follow their hearts, that's all.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.039
- You're Lorna Bucket, aren't you?
- Yep.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.210
Hello, I'm the thin one.
This is my husband, he's the fat one.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.212
Don't you have names?

06:11.580 --> 06:14.424
We're the thin-fat, gay, married
Anglican Marines.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.589
Why would we need names as well?

06:17.961 --> 06:22.341
Oh, looks like I'm off.
Time for my conversion tutorial.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.850
See you in a bit.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.430
Do you have Lent?
'Cause I'm not good at giving things up.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.142
Lorna Bucket.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.895
You've had an encounter, haven't you?

06:34.978 --> 06:37.072
- You've met him.
- I was just a kid.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.570
But what's he like, the Doctor?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.492
He said, "Run."

06:44.988 --> 06:47.366
- just "run"?
- He said it a lot.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.044
And this was in the Gamma Forests, yeah?
Cause you're a Gamma girl, aren't you?

06:51.119 --> 06:53.668
What are you doing here?
The Forests are heaven-neutral.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.873
Yeah.

06:55.373 --> 06:59.298
And 30 seconds of the Doctor is the only
thing that ever happened there.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.516
Oh, this is nice. I like this.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.889
I mean, quite a lot of red.

07:06.968 --> 07:11.269
Hope it's not to hide the stains?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.525
What's in the little boxes?

07:16.311 --> 07:19.360
Welcome, Applicant;
To the Order of the Headless.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.285
It is traditional for visiting armies
of other faiths

07:23.360 --> 07:27.285
to offer individuals for con version
to our order.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.287
You have been selected.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.962
Are you ready

07:35.997 --> 07:37.715
to make a donation?

07:39.584 --> 07:41.257
So, what do you think?

07:41.336 --> 07:43.930
If the Doctor's really coming here,
where is he?

07:44.005 --> 07:47.635
He's the Doctor,
he could be anywhere in time and space.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.103
Whoa!

07:55.600 --> 07:58.649
Thank you, Parky.
I won't be needing you again tonight.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.150
Yes, milady.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.444
Oh, you're back early, ma'am.
Another case cracked, I assume?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.911
Send a telegram to Inspector Abberline
of the Yard.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.869
Jack The Ripper
has claimed his last victim.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.374
How did you find him?

08:16.121 --> 08:17.839
Stringy.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.008
But tasty all the same.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.383
- I shan't be needing dinner.
- Congratulations, ma'am.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.720
However, um...

08:28.675 --> 08:31.144
a matter has arisen in the drawing room.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.017
It just appeared. What does it mean?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.897
It means

08:39.519 --> 08:42.898
a very old debt is to be repaid.

08:44.774 --> 08:48.199
Pack the cases, jenny,
we're going to need the swords.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.242
Nurse.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.411
Nurse!

08:57.746 --> 08:59.339
Damn it, where's the nurse?

08:59.831 --> 09:00.957
He needs help.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.172
Madam President, I'm sorry,
but we have to go now.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.925
Those things could be here any second.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.521
Did somebody call for a nurse?

09:17.474 --> 09:18.771
Will I be okay?

09:18.850 --> 09:22.354
Of course you will, my boy,
you'll be up and around in no time.

09:22.437 --> 09:25.486
And perhaps one day, you and I
shall meet on the field of battle

09:25.565 --> 09:28.865
and I will destroy you
for the glory of the Sontaran Empire.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.197
- Thanks, nurse.
- Pleasure.

09:35.742 --> 09:40.714
Commander Strax,
I just have to ask, a Sontaran nurse?

09:40.789 --> 09:43.838
I serve a penance to restore
the honour of my clone batch.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.591
It is the greatest punishment
a Sontaran can endure.

09:46.669 --> 09:50.173
- To help the weak and sick.
- Who came up with that one?

09:58.556 --> 10:01.605
Tonight, though,
perhaps my penance is over.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.990
Captain Harcourt, I hope someday
to meet you in the glory of battle,

10:07.065 --> 10:10.069
where I shall crush the life
from your worthless human form.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.994
Try and get some rest.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.885
Oh, turn it off,
I'm breaking in, not out.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.837
This is River Song, back in her cell.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.883
Oh, and I'll take breakfast
at the usual time.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.343
Thank you.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.318
Oh, are you boys dressing up
as Romans now?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.150
I thought nobody read my memos.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.902
Dr Song,

10:50.608 --> 10:51.655
it's Rory.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.238
Sorry, have we met yet?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.743
The time streams,
I'm not quite sure where we are.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.749
Yes. Yes, we've met.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.249
Hello, Rory.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.969
What's wrong?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.302
It's my birthday.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.143
The Doctor took me ice skating
on the River Thames in 1814,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.016
the last of the great Frost Fairs.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.190
He got Stevie Wonder to sing
for me under London Bridge.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.892
Stevie Wonder sang in 1814?

11:23.975 --> 11:26.819
Yes, he did!
But you must never tell him.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.819
I've come from the Doctor, too.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.491
- Yes, but at a different point in time.
- Unless there's two of them.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.824
Now, that's a whole different birthday.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.831
He needs you.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.038
Demon's Run.

11:46.998 --> 11:47.999
How...

11:48.541 --> 11:50.214
How did you know?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.305
I'm from his future. I always know.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.549
Why on earth are you wearing that?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.644
- The Doctor's idea.
- Of course.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.811
His rules of engagement.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.764
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.771
- Look ridiculous.
- Have you considered heels?

12:05.850 --> 12:09.195
They've taken Amy. And our baby.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.654
The Doctor's getting
some people together.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.905
We're going after her,
but he needs you too.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.658
I can't.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.628
Not yet, anyway.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.419
I'm sorry?

12:28.498 --> 12:30.592
This is the battle of Demon's Run,

12:30.667 --> 12:32.214
the Doctor's darkest hour.

12:32.293 --> 12:36.639
He'll rise higher than ever before
and then fall so much further.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.762
And I can't be with him
till the very end.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.183
Why not?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.350
Because this is it.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.358
This is the day he finds out who I am.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.749
Good bye.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.848
You appear to be closing down, Dorium.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.510
What have you heard?

13:22.593 --> 13:25.267
That you pricked the side
of a mighty beast, Madam Kovarian,

13:25.346 --> 13:27.394
and entirely failed to run.

13:28.182 --> 13:33.029
I admire your courage.
I should like to admire it from afar.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.656
We've been waiting a month.
He's done nothing.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.196
Do you really think so?

13:38.276 --> 13:41.655
There are people all over this galaxy
that owe that man a debt.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.786
By now, a few of them
will have found a blue box

13:43.865 --> 13:46.744
waiting for them on their doorstep.
Poor devils.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.628
You think he's raising an army?

13:49.037 --> 13:50.038
You think he isn't?

13:51.122 --> 13:54.922
If that man is finally collecting
on his debts, God help you.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.378
And God help his debtors.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.550
Why?

13:58.629 --> 14:00.176
Colonel Manton,

14:01.049 --> 14:03.677
all those stories
you've heard about him,

14:03.760 --> 14:05.808
they're not stories, they're true.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.434
Really.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.891
You're not telling me
you don't know what's coming?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.981
- We're wasting our time here.
- Agreed.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.688
The asteroid,

14:15.480 --> 14:17.574
where you've made your base,

14:17.732 --> 14:20.326
do you know
why they call it Demon's Run?

14:20.401 --> 14:23.154
How do you know
the location of our base?

14:23.237 --> 14:26.741
You're with the Headless Monks,
they're old customers of mine.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.706
It's just some old saying.

14:28.743 --> 14:31.462
A very old saying. The oldest.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.462
"Demons run
when a good man goes to war."

14:51.808 --> 14:55.028
No! No, no, please! Not me.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.815
You don't need me.
Why would you need me?

14:59.065 --> 15:02.160
I'm old, I'm fat, I'm blue.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.995
You can't need me!

15:07.407 --> 15:09.125
He is not the Devil.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.454
He's not a god.

15:14.372 --> 15:18.172
He's not a goblin or a phantom
or a trickster.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.514
The Doctor is a living, breathing man.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.432
And as I look around this room,
I know one thing,

15:30.430 --> 15:32.683
we're sure as hell going to fix that.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.267
Yes!

15:35.685 --> 15:37.653
Yes!

15:44.026 --> 15:45.198
Sorry.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.248
I... I shouldn't be here,
I'm meant to be at the thing.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.204
I brought you something.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.333
Your child's name,
in the language of my people.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.805
It's a prayer leaf, and we believe
if you keep this with you,

16:04.589 --> 16:06.216
your child will always come home to you.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.263
Can I borrow your gun?

16:09.594 --> 16:10.595
Why?

16:10.678 --> 16:13.898
'Cause I've got a feeling
you're going to keep talking.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.442
They're talking like he's famous.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.074
The Doctor isn't famous.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.531
He meets a lot of people.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.787
Some of them remember.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.706
He's sort of like a...

16:35.953 --> 16:36.954
I don't know.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.333
- A dark legend.
- Dark.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.216
- Have you met him?
- Yeah.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.473
But I was just a little girl then.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.434
So was I.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.684
You've been with him a long time, then?

16:54.597 --> 16:55.723
No.

16:57.767 --> 16:58.939
He came back for me.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.531
You must be very special.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.411
Hey,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.662
you can wait a long time for the Doctor
but he's worth it, okay?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.915
Thing is, he's coming,
no question about it.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.964
Just you make sure you're on
the right side when he gets here.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.213
Not for my sake, for yours.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.888
Thank you.

17:38.140 --> 17:43.522
On this day, in this place,
the Doctor will fall.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.072
Hurrah!

17:45.147 --> 17:48.617
The man who talks, the man who reasons,

17:48.693 --> 17:52.368
the man who lies
will meet the perfect answer.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.618
Hurrah!

17:55.575 --> 17:58.749
Some of you have wondered
why we have allied ourselves

17:58.828 --> 18:00.796
with the Headless Monks.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.926
Perhaps you should have wondered
why we call them "headless".

18:09.755 --> 18:14.056
It's time you knew what these guys
have sacrificed for faith.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.650
As you all know,
it is a level one heresy,

18:20.725 --> 18:25.151
punishable by death,
to lower the hood of a Headless Monk.

18:26.814 --> 18:31.615
But by the divine grant
of the Papal Mainframe herself,

18:32.695 --> 18:37.417
on this one and only occasion,
I can show you the truth.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.464
Because these guys never can be...

18:47.793 --> 18:49.136
persuaded.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.515
They never can be...

18:56.385 --> 18:57.386
afraid.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.773
And they can never ever be...

19:03.059 --> 19:05.027
Surprised.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.536
Hello everyone, guess who?

19:13.611 --> 19:16.785
Please, point a gun at me,
if it helps you relax.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.875
You're only human.

19:28.501 --> 19:32.176
Go on, resist, I am ever so hungry.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.091
Now, dear,
which button controls the lights?

19:35.758 --> 19:38.682
Doctor, you will come with me right now.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.597
Three minutes, 40 seconds.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.106
Amelia Pond! Get your coat!

19:55.152 --> 19:56.825
- I'm not a phantom.
- Doctor?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.372
I'm not a trickster.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.125
- Doctor?
- I'm a Monk.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.206
- Doctor, show yourself.
- It's him!

20:08.457 --> 20:09.754
He's here.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.378
It's him!

20:18.300 --> 20:21.304
Weapons down. Do not fire!

20:24.890 --> 20:26.892
No!

20:29.854 --> 20:31.447
Follow me.

20:31.522 --> 20:34.025
Doctor? Doctor!

20:35.818 --> 20:38.788
- Clever, isn't he?
- And rather attractive.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.915
You do realise he's a man,
don't you, ma'am?

20:40.990 --> 20:44.460
- Mammals, they all look alike.
- Thank you.

20:45.161 --> 20:48.210
Do not fire. Nobody discharge
their weapon in this room.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.290
Nobody.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.917
Do not fire.

20:52.543 --> 20:57.891
Was I being insensitive again, dear?
I don't know why you put up with me.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.564
Stop, wait.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.349
Listen to me.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.603
I'm disarming my weapon pack.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.942
Monks, I do this in good faith.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.534
I am now unarmed.

21:24.575 --> 21:27.203
All of you discharge you weapon packs.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.048
The Doctor is trying
to make fools of us.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.335
We are soldiers of God.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.046
We are not fools.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.300
We are not fools.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.805
We are not fools.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.263
We are not fools.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.891
We are not fools.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.941
We are not fools.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.940
We are not fools.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.152
We're not fools.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.862
- Colonel Manton is regaining control.
- Where has the Doctor gone?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.256
We are not fools.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.591
We are not fools.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.545
We are not fools!

22:40.943 --> 22:43.446
This space is now under our command.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.156
I have a fleet out there.

22:45.239 --> 22:48.914
If Demon's Run goes down,
there's an automatic distress call.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.872
Not if we knock out
your communications array.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.877
And you've got incoming.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.834
Danny Boy to the Doctor,
Danny Boy to the Doctor.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.045
Give 'em hell, Danny Boy.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.567
I need to get off this station now.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.857
Bring me the child.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.401
Target destroyed

23:24.820 --> 23:26.618
Don't slump, it's bad for your spine.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.043
Get back in there with the rest of them.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.755
Remember,
the Doctor must think he's winning

23:38.834 --> 23:40.802
right until the trap closes.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.888
I'll take my ship from here.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.683
Air lock engaged
Shuttle ready for boarding.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.185
No.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.394
I have a crew of 20.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.026
How do you expect
to gain control of my ship?

24:01.899 --> 24:03.321
The ship is ours, milady.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.574
All airlocks sealed.
Resistance neutralised.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.955
Sony, Colonel Manton, I lied.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.585
Three minutes 42 seconds.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.501
Colonel Manton, you will give the order
for your men to withdraw.

24:20.584 --> 24:25.090
No, Colonel Manton,
I want you to tell your men to run away.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.219
What?

24:26.590 --> 24:27.682
Those words, "Run away."

24:27.758 --> 24:31.808
I want you to be famous
for those exact words.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.481
I want people to call you
Colonel Runaway.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.399
I want children
laughing outside your door

24:36.475 --> 24:38.648
'cause they've found the house
of Colonel Runaway.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.729
And when people come to you

24:40.813 --> 24:43.942
and ask if trying to get to me
through the people I love...

24:45.985 --> 24:47.987
is in any way a good idea,

24:52.491 --> 24:54.869
I want you to tell them your name.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.414
Look, I'm angry, that's new.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.509
I'm really not sure
what's going to happen now.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.178
The anger of a good man
is not a problem.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.758
Good men have too many rules.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.308
Good men don't need rules.

25:20.269 --> 25:23.614
Today is not the day
to find out why I have so many.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.615
- Hmm?
- Give the order.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.670
Give the order, Colonel Runaway.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.544
Who's that? Who's there?
You watch it, because I am armed

25:45.627 --> 25:48.676
and really dangerous and cross.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.883
Yeah, like I don't know that.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.637
Rory? Rory, is that you?

25:56.013 --> 25:57.435
Yeah, it's me.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.769
Look, hang on a minute.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.981
They took her.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.942
Rory, they took our baby away.

26:09.818 --> 26:15.621
Now, Mrs Williams,
that is never ever going to happen.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.006
Oh, my God.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.175
Where's she been?
What have they done to her?

26:32.257 --> 26:35.306
She's fine. Amy, she's fine, I checked.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.223
She's beautiful.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.394
Oh, God, I was going to be cool.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.697
- I wanted to be cool and look at me.
- You're okay.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.284
A crying Roman with a baby.
Definitely cool.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.486
Come here, you.

26:54.780 --> 26:59.627
Ew, kissing and crying.
I'll... I'll be back in a bit.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.706
Oi, you. Get in here, now.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.421
My daughter.

27:11.755 --> 27:15.100
- What do you think?
- Hello. Hello, uh...

27:15.801 --> 27:17.428
baby.
Uh, Melody.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.680
Melody? Hello, Melody Pond.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.399
- Melody Williams.
- Is a geography teacher.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.647
Melody Pond is a superhero.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.859
Well, yes,
I suppose she does smell nice.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.611
Never really sniffed a...

27:29.690 --> 27:32.364
Maybe I should give it a go.
Amelia Pond, come here.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.534
Doctor.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.829
Sorry we were so long.  Ah.

27:35.863 --> 27:40.289
It's okay. I knew you were coming.
Both of you, my boys.

27:41.577 --> 27:45.298
It's okay. She's still all yours
and really you should call her Mummy.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.875
Not Big Milk Thing.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.711
- Okay, what are you doing?
- I speak baby.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.262
No, you don't.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.798
I speak everything.

27:54.882 --> 27:55.974
Don't I, Melody Pond?

27:59.261 --> 28:00.888
No, it's not. It's cool.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.730
Doctor, take a look, they're leaving.

28:05.309 --> 28:08.734
Demon's Run is ours
without a drop of blood spilled.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.533
My friend, you have never risen higher.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.454
Hey, what's wrong?

28:21.533 --> 28:24.286
She doesn't like the Tardis noise.
I asked him to turn something off,

28:24.369 --> 28:25.871
but it was all,
"But I don't want to punch a hole"

28:25.954 --> 28:27.706
"in the space-time continuum."

28:27.789 --> 28:31.839
Rory, the Judoon have escorted
the clerics out of the quadrant.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.842
Spitfires have returned
to their own time.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.765
Captain Avery and his men are going...
Is she all right?

28:36.840 --> 28:37.887
Yeah, she's just crying.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.843
Give her to me, human fools,
she needs changing.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.646
I just changed her.
I think she might need a feed.

28:42.721 --> 28:46.100
A feed?
Of course, I'll take care of everything.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.065
Uh, I really don't think
you will, actually.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.981
I have gene-spliced myself
for all nursing duties.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.034
I can produce magnificent quantities
of lactic fluid.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.157
She's not hungry, she's tired.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.956
Sony, Melody,
they're just not listening.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.792
What's this? Melody?

29:03.867 --> 29:05.494
Very pretty, according to your daughter.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.875
- It's, uh...
- It's a cot.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.458
No flies on the Roman.

29:10.540 --> 29:13.714
Give her here.
Hey, here we go. Oh, hello.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.297
But where would you get a cot?

29:16.421 --> 29:18.549
It's old. Really old.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.728
Doctor, um, do you have children?

29:24.012 --> 29:25.059
No.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.269
Have you ever had children?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.899
No, no, it's real, it's my hair.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.694
Who slept in here?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.400
Doctor, we need you
in the main control room.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.484
Be right there.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.865
Things to do. I've still got to work out
what this base is for.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.452
We can't leave till we know.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.908
Uh, but this is where I was.

29:45.367 --> 29:49.338
The whole time I thought I was
on the Tardis, I was really here.

29:49.746 --> 29:53.216
Ah, Centurion, permission to hug?

29:54.251 --> 29:57.425
- Be aware, I do have a sword.
- At all times.

30:01.341 --> 30:06.097
You were on the Tardis, too,
your heart and mind, soul.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.479
But physically, yes,
you were still in this place.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.310
And when I saw that face looking
through the hatch,

30:11.393 --> 30:12.610
that woman looking at me?

30:12.686 --> 30:13.733
Reality bleeding through.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.314
They must've taken you
quite a while back,

30:15.397 --> 30:17.195
just before America.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.076
That's probably enough hugging now.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.240
So, her flesh avatar was
with us all that time?

30:25.324 --> 30:28.077
But that means they were projecting a
control signal right into the Tardis,

30:28.160 --> 30:30.254
- wherever we were in time and space.
- Yeah, they're very clever.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.876
- Who are?
- Whoever wants our baby.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.333
- Why did they want her?
- Exactly.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.135
Is there anything you're not telling us?

30:37.753 --> 30:39.972
You knew Amy wasn't real,
you never said.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.220
Well, I couldn't be sure
they weren't listening.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.143
But you always hold out on us,
please, not this time.

30:45.218 --> 30:48.438
Doctor, it's our baby.
Tell us something. One little thing.

30:49.598 --> 30:50.815
It's mine.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.774
- What is?
- Cot. It's my cot.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.572
I slept in there.

31:00.859 --> 31:04.113
Oh, my God.
It's the Doctor's first stars.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.375
She's...

31:09.910 --> 31:13.039
Drop your weapons!
State your rank and intent.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.791
I found it listening at the door.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.501
You've hacked into their software, then?

31:17.584 --> 31:20.428
- I believe I sold it to them.
- Ooh. So what have we learned?

31:20.462 --> 31:22.806
That anger is always
the shortest distance to a mistake.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.222
- I'm sorry?
- The words of an old friend,

31:26.301 --> 31:29.396
who once found me
in the London Underground

31:29.471 --> 31:33.192
attempting to avenge my sisters
on perfectly innocent tunnel diggers.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.644
Well, you were very cross at the time.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.277
As you were today, old friend.
Point taken, I hope.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.614
Now, I have a question. A simple one.
Is Melody human?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.534
Sorry, what?

31:46.613 --> 31:48.957
Of course she is. Completely human.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.705
What are you talking about?

31:50.784 --> 31:52.536
They've been scanning her
since she was born.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.626
And I think they found
what they were looking for.

31:55.705 --> 31:58.504
- Human DNA.
- Look closer.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.960
Human plus.

32:00.627 --> 32:04.131
Specifically, human plus Time Lord.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.886
But I heard her talking. This is a trap.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.391
Why would I lie to you?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.393
Well, you might want
to take a look at your uniform.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.521
The only reason I joined the clerics
was so I could meet the Doctor again.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.979
You wanted to meet him
so you joined an army to fight him?

32:19.020 --> 32:20.943
Well, how else
do you meet a great warrior?

32:20.981 --> 32:23.575
- He's not a warrior.
- Then why is he called the Doctor?

32:29.114 --> 32:32.209
It's starting. Please listen to me!

32:33.660 --> 32:37.005
But she's human.
She's Amy and Rory's daughter.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.673
You've told me about your people.

32:38.748 --> 32:42.469
They became what they did through
prolonged exposure to the time vortex.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.421
The untempered schism.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.724
Over billions of years.
It didn't just happen.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.973
So, how close is she...
Could she even regenerate?

32:52.762 --> 32:54.981
No! No. I don't think so.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.524
You don't sound so sure.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.102
Because I don't understand
how this happened.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.029
Which leads me to ask,
when did it happen?

33:02.063 --> 33:03.064
When?

33:04.316 --> 33:06.785
I am trying to be delicate.
I know how you can blush.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.531
When did this baby...

33:12.282 --> 33:13.875
begin?

33:15.494 --> 33:17.246
- Oh, you mean...
- Quite.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.999
Well, how would I know?
That's all humany private stuff.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.551
It just sort of goes on.
They don't put up a balloon or anything.

33:23.627 --> 33:27.257
Well, could the child have begun
on the Tardis, in flight, in the vortex?

33:27.339 --> 33:30.138
No! No! Impossible.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.891
It's all running about,
sexy fish vampires

33:32.969 --> 33:34.186
and blowing up stuff.

33:34.221 --> 33:36.815
And Rory wasn't even there
at the beginning. Then he was dead.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.814
Then he didn't exist.
Then he was plastic.

33:39.893 --> 33:42.021
Then I had to reboot the whole universe.
Long story.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.314
So, technically,

33:43.396 --> 33:45.865
the first time they were on the Tardis
together in this version of reality

33:45.941 --> 33:46.942
was on their...

33:47.025 --> 33:49.744
- On their what?
- Hmm?

33:50.695 --> 33:52.368
On their wedding night.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.707
Confirmed.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.711
No life forms registering on this base
except us and the Silurians.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.255
The Headless Monks aren't alive.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.128
They don't register as life forms.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.634
It doesn't make sense. You can't
just cook yourself a Time Lord.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.763
Of course not.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.054
But you gave them one hell of a start

34:15.136 --> 34:17.355
and they've been working very hard
ever since.

34:17.429 --> 34:20.274
And yet they gave in so easily.
Does this not bother anyone else?

34:20.350 --> 34:23.103
Amy, she worried that the baby
would have a time head, she said that...

34:23.186 --> 34:25.313
Only you would ignore
the instincts of a mother.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.274
Or the instincts of a coward.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.234
This is too easy.
There's something wrong.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.318
Why even do it?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.370
Even if you could get your hands
on a brand new Time Lord, what for?

34:32.445 --> 34:34.539
- A weapon?
- Why would a Time Lord be a weapon?

34:34.614 --> 34:38.039
Well, they've seen you.

34:39.661 --> 34:40.878
Me?

34:42.914 --> 34:47.465
Mr Maldavar, you are right.
This was too easy.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.387
We should get back to the others.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.053
Me.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.063
I'd say she's human,
going by the life support software.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.773
She climbed out of the suit.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.781
Like, she forced her way out.
She must be incredibly strong.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.828
I see you accessed our files.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.823
Do you understand yet?

35:16.489 --> 35:19.493
Oh, don't worry I'm a long way away.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.079
But I like to keep tabs on you.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.419
The child, then. What do you think?

35:25.498 --> 35:27.466
- What is she?
- Hope.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.882
Hope in this endless, bitter war.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.843
What war? Against who?

35:37.010 --> 35:39.889
Against you, Doctor.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.154
What's that?

36:00.450 --> 36:01.918
Force field.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.750
And those are the doors.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.502
Locking.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.093
Apparently we're not leaving.

36:21.638 --> 36:24.812
- Is that the monks?
- Oh, dear God!

36:24.891 --> 36:26.108
That's the attack prayer.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.606
Quick, come with me.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.812
Commander Strax.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.774
I'm trying to seal off this area
of the lighting grid.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.575
This is where we'll make our stand.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.279
Clear lines of sight on all approaches.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.704
Rory, no of fence to the others,

36:41.741 --> 36:43.994
but you'll let them all die first, okay?

36:44.077 --> 36:45.249
You're so Scottish.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.095
Centurion, you're needed!

37:01.428 --> 37:05.058
There should be some plasma pistols
somewhere. They left everything.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.312
Then find them, boy!

37:06.391 --> 37:09.315
- She's definitely a girl.
- Oh, stop it!

37:10.228 --> 37:11.946
We don't have to fight them.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.860
I'm friends to the monks. They know me.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.653
Yeah, and they know
you just sold them out to the Doctor.

37:18.737 --> 37:23.083
Oh, they'll understand. It's only me.
Only silly old me.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.332
You understand, don't you?

37:26.411 --> 37:28.334
Mr Maldavar, get back here.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.290
- Arm yourself, fool.
- Dorium!

37:35.170 --> 37:36.592
Mr Maldavar?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.302
Dorium?

37:43.470 --> 37:45.143
The child.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.895
At all costs, protect the child.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.942
The child is not a weapon!

37:53.021 --> 37:56.195
Oh, give us time. She can be.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.696
She will be.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.824
Except you've already lost her,
and I swear

37:59.861 --> 38:01.955
I will never let you
anywhere near her again.

38:02.030 --> 38:06.035
Oh, Doctor
fooling you once was a joy

38:06.117 --> 38:09.291
but fooling you twice the same way?

38:09.996 --> 38:11.873
[Tis a privilege.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.508
Amy. Amy!

38:31.810 --> 38:35.030
Demons run when a good man goes to wan.

38:35.063 --> 38:40.035
Night will fall and drown the sun
when a good man goes to wan.

38:40.109 --> 38:43.079
Friendship dies and true love lies,

38:43.154 --> 38:46.408
night will fall and the dark will rise

38:46.491 --> 38:48.619
when a good man goes to wan

38:49.160 --> 38:51.003
Amy!

38:51.079 --> 38:53.457
Demons run but count the cost.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.384
- The battle's won but the child is lost.
- Amy!

38:56.459 --> 38:59.303
Wakey wakey.

38:59.379 --> 39:00.596
Amy!

39:05.510 --> 39:07.137
Rory?

39:07.679 --> 39:10.102
Rory! Rory!

39:13.142 --> 39:15.019
Amy, she's not real.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.029
Melody, she's a flesh avatar.

39:17.772 --> 39:18.773
Amy!

39:20.400 --> 39:21.652
Amy!

39:23.486 --> 39:24.783
Amy?

39:29.909 --> 39:32.128
Yeah, we know.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.507
It's strange.

39:44.674 --> 39:47.598
I have often dreamed of dying in combat.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.107
I'm not enjoying it
as much as I had hoped.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.603
Come on, Strax.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.478
- Don't give up.
- It's all right.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.563
I've had a good life.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.366
I'm nearly 12.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.118
Listen to me.

40:04.193 --> 40:07.037
You'll be back on your feet in no time.
You're a warrior.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.332
Row,

40:12.619 --> 40:14.462
I'm a nurse.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.393
So they took her anyway.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.237
All this was for nothing.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.524
I am so...

40:44.067 --> 40:45.114
sorry.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.122
Amy, it's not his fault.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.628
I know. I know.

40:59.874 --> 41:03.549
Doctor, there's someone
who wants to speak to you.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.677
He name is Lorna. She came to warn us.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.109
Hey. Hello.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.531
Doctor.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.030
You helped my friends.

41:30.947 --> 41:31.994
Thank you.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.950
I met you once.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.417
In the Gamma Forests.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.546
You don't remember me.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.128
Hey, of course I remember.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.215
I remember everyone.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.719
Hey. We ran.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.062
You and me.

41:56.806 --> 41:58.558
Didn't we run, Lorna?

42:13.448 --> 42:14.574
Who was she?

42:15.116 --> 42:17.335
I don't know but she was very brave.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.664
They're always brave.

42:25.668 --> 42:26.760
They're always brave.

42:27.587 --> 42:29.681
So, what now?

42:29.756 --> 42:32.350
They'd almost certainly
have taken her to Earth,

42:32.383 --> 42:34.477
raised her in the correct environment.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.147
Yes, they did.
And it's already too late.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.683
You're giving up? You never do that.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.108
Yeah, and don't you sometimes
wish I did?

42:44.395 --> 42:48.070
Well, then, soldier,
how goes the day?

42:54.572 --> 42:56.916
Where the hell have you been?

42:56.991 --> 42:58.709
Every time you have asked,
I have been there.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.628
Where the hell were you today?

43:01.662 --> 43:04.632
- I couldn't have prevented this.
- You could have tried.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.425
And so, my love, could you.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.421
I know you're not all right.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.891
But hold tight, Amy,
because you're going to be.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.432
You think I wanted this?
I didn't do this.

43:17.512 --> 43:19.640
This... This wasn't me!

43:19.722 --> 43:22.692
This was exactly you.
All this. All of it.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.144
You make them so afraid.

43:25.812 --> 43:29.282
When you began all those years ago,
sailing off to see the universe,

43:29.357 --> 43:31.200
did you ever think you'd become this?

43:32.318 --> 43:35.447
The man who can turn an army around
at the mention of his name.

43:36.781 --> 43:37.953
Doctor.

43:38.866 --> 43:43.121
The word for "healer" and "wise man"
throughout the universe.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.957
We get that word from you, you know.

43:46.958 --> 43:51.589
But if you carry on the way you are,
what might that word come to mean?

43:54.298 --> 43:56.596
To the people of the Gamma Forests

43:56.676 --> 43:59.896
the word "doctor"
means "mighty warrior".

44:01.514 --> 44:03.061
How far you've come.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.274
And now they've taken a child.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.230
The child of your best friends.

44:09.981 --> 44:14.487
And they're going to turn her
into a weapon just to bring you down.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.446
And all this, my love,

44:17.530 --> 44:18.827
in fear of you.

44:31.627 --> 44:32.799
Who are you?

44:35.381 --> 44:37.304
Oh, look, your cot.
Haven't seen that in a very long while.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.935
No. No, you tell me. You tell me

44:40.386 --> 44:41.638
who you are.

44:45.141 --> 44:47.269
I am telling you.

44:52.231 --> 44:53.403
Can't you read?

45:15.129 --> 45:16.221
Hello.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.432
Hello.

45:21.135 --> 45:24.514
- But that means...
- I'm afraid it does.

45:26.390 --> 45:30.111
Ooh. But you and I, we-we-we, uh...

45:30.603 --> 45:32.276
Yes.

45:33.773 --> 45:34.899
Ooh.

45:38.861 --> 45:39.987
How do I look?

45:41.781 --> 45:42.998
Amazing.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.997
- I'd better be.
- Yes, you'd better be.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.544
- Vastra and jenny, till the next time.
- Doctor.

45:46.619 --> 45:48.371
Rory and Amy,
I know where to find your daughter

45:48.454 --> 45:50.422
and on my life, she will be safe.

45:50.498 --> 45:51.841
River, get them all home.

45:51.916 --> 45:54.886
- Doctor?
- Look, where are you going?

45:55.711 --> 45:56.803
No.

46:17.149 --> 46:18.992
Where is he going?
What did you tell him?

46:20.278 --> 46:21.746
Amy, you have to stay calm.

46:24.073 --> 46:25.916
Tell me what you told the Doctor.

46:25.992 --> 46:27.414
Amy, no. Stop it.

46:27.493 --> 46:29.370
It's okay, Row. She's fine. She's good.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.589
It's the Tardis translation matrix.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.546
It takes a while to kick in
with the written word.

46:34.625 --> 46:35.877
You have to concentrate.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.015
I still can't read it.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.098
It's because it's Gallifreyan
and doesn't translate.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.066
But this will.

46:54.353 --> 46:56.981
It's your daughter's name
in the language of the Forest.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.946
I know my daughter's name.

46:59.567 --> 47:02.070
Except they don't have
a word for "pond"

47:02.153 --> 47:04.781
because the only water in the Forest
is the river.

47:05.990 --> 47:08.209
The Doctor will find your daughter

47:08.284 --> 47:10.628
and he will care for her,
whatever it takes.

47:11.454 --> 47:12.922
And I know that.

47:23.341 --> 47:24.467
It's me.

47:26.719 --> 47:27.936
I'm Melody.

47:30.014 --> 47:31.231
I'm your daughter.
