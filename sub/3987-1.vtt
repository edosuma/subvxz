You let him get right next to you.

SARAH: No, no.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.928
Why, are you one?

27:09.995 --> 27:12.737
No. Never met a soldier-boy, eh?

27:13.031 --> 27:15.773
- No whisperings from Professor Duncan?
- No. No.

27:16.401 --> 27:17.675

don't you?

36:09.334 --> 36:10.608
More than anything?

36:12.370 --> 36:15.613
So, if you're having second thoughts,

36:16.641 --> 36:17.881
remember Kira.

36:20.311 --> 36:21.517
Please.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.025
Poor, damaged Rachel.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.519
What happened to you?

36:27.352 --> 36:28.592
Hmm?

36:29.454 --> 36:31.331
Who's behind that face?

36:33.224 --> 36:35.363
You don't recognise me, Ferdinand.

36:37.328 --> 36:38.329
No.

36:43.334 --> 36:44.779
Do you recognise me now?

36:45.470 --> 36:46.574
Yes!

36:52.577 --> 36:53.851
- (BELT CRACKS)

36:55.213 --> 36:56.851

- Yes!

36:57.482 --> 36:58.552
Yes!

37:03.488 --> 37:04.660
Pull it. (SCREAMS)

37:05.457 --> 37:06.561

37:06.691 --> 37:07.726
No! (GRUNTS)

Stop! Come on, stop!

37:35.587 --> 37:36.657
Come on.

37:37.288 --> 37:38.323
Get up. Go.

37:39.824 --> 37:41.895
- What is this...
- Shut up and stop squirming!

37:42.727 --> 37:45.173
(BREATHING HEAVILY) I...
I'm sanctioned by Topside.

37:45.296 --> 37:48.072
To conduct a security review
of self-aware clones,

37:48.166 --> 37:49.770
not screw our product!

37:50.268 --> 37:51.542
Helsinki's happening, Delphine.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.245
Won't Marian be impressed?

37:54.706 --> 37:56.583
Conspiring with one clone
to murder the others.

37:57.075 --> 37:59.214
Now who will pay for this, hmm? Her?

37:59.844 --> 38:03.223
Topside's favourite pet,
or you, Ferdinand?

38:03.915 --> 38:05.326
Because they will kill you.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.297
What do you want?

38:29.073 --> 38:30.177
(DOOR CLOSES)

38:34.946 --> 38:36.152
Marian will meet us in Zürich.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.853
You report to Topside
that Dyad is secure.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.960
And self-aware LEDA clones
an essential evolution of the programme.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.561
I know how leverage works.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.192
Good. Wait for me downstairs.

38:48.960 --> 38:49.995
Rachel?

38:56.734 --> 38:57.838
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- (SIGHS)

39:00.371 --> 39:02.214
Rachel was going to eliminate us.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.380
- Everybody we love.
- Yes.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.214
- They've done it before.
- You should've told me.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.723
I only did this for Helena.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.884
I know. I counted on it.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.490
You said you'd help me find her.

39:12.550 --> 39:13.961
I already am.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.390
But until I figure out
what CASTOR really is,

39:16.487 --> 39:17.761
you need to stand down.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.367
And don't try anything else.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.332
I'll be back.

inside a box, inside a box.

All. right.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.207
In you go.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.151
PUPOK: Congratulations.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.990
You escaped the first box.

another world or something.

what these maniacs are after.</i>

40:57.655 --> 40:59.328
She says they have the same tattoo.

40:59.390 --> 41:02.496
Both the LEDA and CASTOR
originals are lost.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.595
Yet another mystery.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.798
Helena, I'm very happy to meet you.

ALISON: I could beat her, Donnie.

41:08.032 --> 41:09.375
I could beat her like a French meringue.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.408
You have your orders.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.146
We're gonna finish the job.
