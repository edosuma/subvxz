00:00.659 --> 00:02.259
You broke into his camper van?

00:02.299 --> 00:04.859
Well, George was spying on me.
Spying on you?!

00:04.899 --> 00:06.099
KATZ:On the pub's CCTV,

00:06.139 --> 00:08.899
there's images of Ed
really laying into George.

I had nothing to do
with what happened to George.

00:12.979 --> 00:14.659
will you marry me?

00:14.699 --> 00:16.819
I know what I did

00:16.859 --> 00:18.379
and what I've had to hide.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.619
You might be next.

00:19.659 --> 00:22.259
My son wasn't cold in the ground
before you were shagging my wife!

00:22.299 --> 00:23.739
That's not what happened!

00:26.979 --> 00:29.739

Hi, love.

03:02.659 --> 03:04.379
Any news?
No.

Ryan.

03:09.099 --> 03:10.339
Bob's here too.

03:13.379 --> 03:15.259
He's not contacted you?

03:19.019 --> 03:20.739
I told him to go.

03:22.579 --> 03:23.899
I had enough.

03:23.939 --> 03:26.699
It's not your fault.

03:26.739 --> 03:29.259
We've both been worried
about him, Claire.

03:29.299 --> 03:31.299
Obviously, I don't know him
as well as you.

03:31.339 --> 03:34.139
We don't know who you are.
That's the real problem.

03:35.179 --> 03:36.819
BOB:Here we go.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.259
When was the last time you saw him?

03:41.299 --> 03:42.619
By the boat.

03:42.659 --> 03:45.179
Police came
and he was off like a shot.

03:45.219 --> 03:47.419
Where do you think he's gone?

03:47.459 --> 03:49.739
Oh, he knows the rocks and dunes
like no-one else.

03:49.779 --> 03:50.899
Do you think he did it, Bob?

03:53.859 --> 03:55.259
You do.

03:55.299 --> 03:57.179
I've not seen him like this before.

03:57.219 --> 03:59.179
You know yourself.

03:59.219 --> 04:00.859
Why would he kill George?

04:00.899 --> 04:03.259
All started
when he found that photo.

04:03.299 --> 04:05.539
That said "guilty"?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.059
Where's your slippers, Bob?

04:08.219 --> 04:09.699

04:09.739 --> 04:11.099

I don't know why this is happening.

04:39.659 --> 04:42.979
Is this what I think it is?
Mm-hm. Ryan proposed last night.

04:44.099 --> 04:45.539
Why didn't you say?

04:45.579 --> 04:47.739
It's not exactly the right time,
is it? I know, but...

04:47.779 --> 04:50.419
Dad is not capable
of killing anyone.

04:50.459 --> 04:52.059
Then why is he on the run?

04:53.339 --> 04:55.939
Why doesn't he just
tell them the truth?

04:56.979 --> 04:59.299
Because he can't.

04:59.339 --> 05:02.579
He couldn't tell you, me or Bob.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.059
But whatever it is...

08:16.579 --> 08:18.419
He's an old friend of Ed's.

08:18.459 --> 08:21.579
Do you have any idea
when your husband last saw him?

08:22.619 --> 08:25.019
He'd not seen him for years.

08:25.059 --> 08:26.699
But he was here two days ago.

08:27.979 --> 08:29.339
What's happened to him?

08:29.379 --> 08:31.339
He was found this morning.

08:31.379 --> 08:33.499
The victim of a fatal hit and run.

08:33.539 --> 08:35.659
And you think my husband's involved?

08:35.699 --> 08:37.579
We found his car near the scene,
Mrs Collier -

08:37.619 --> 08:40.059
he certainly has questions
to answer.

08:41.299 --> 08:44.619
Look, if any of you know,
or have any idea, where Ed is,

08:44.659 --> 08:46.659
then please, for his sake, tell us.

08:47.659 --> 08:50.939

and talk to him, the better it is.

09:30.739 --> 09:33.099

It's for me.

09:33.139 --> 09:36.059
I hope I didn't
cause you too much trouble.

09:36.099 --> 09:40.139
I gave the police the CCTV
of you and George.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.419
You did the right thing.

09:43.179 --> 09:45.299
Everyone reckons you did it.

09:45.339 --> 09:47.619

running away like this?

11:45.099 --> 11:46.339
You gonna hand me in?

11:47.419 --> 11:49.659
How come they found
your gutting knife in the bin

11:49.699 --> 11:51.699
with blood on it?
If I'd have killed George

11:51.739 --> 11:53.859
out on the boat...

11:53.899 --> 11:57.019
what the fuck would I be doing
bringing my knife home

11:57.059 --> 11:59.819
and chucking it in the bin
for the police to find?

11:59.859 --> 12:01.859
I'd have done it out there,
wouldn't I?

12:01.899 --> 12:03.579
I'd have thrown the body
and the knife -

12:03.619 --> 12:05.259
like, everything - into the sea.

12:05.299 --> 12:06.739
So you think you've been set up?

12:17.619 --> 12:19.099
We did something...

12:20.619 --> 12:21.779
..years ago.

12:24.619 --> 12:27.219
And we swore
that we'd never tell anyone.

12:29.699 --> 12:32.579
You think one of them killed George?
Mm, yeah.

12:32.619 --> 12:36.419
It's this guy - Craig Passarello.

12:40.499 --> 12:42.739
You sure?
Yeah.

12:44.019 --> 12:45.499
Because, according to the police,

12:45.539 --> 12:48.219
he was found dead this morning
in a hit and run.

12:49.259 --> 12:52.539
Maybe whoever killed him
murdered George as well.

12:52.579 --> 12:54.499
So if it's not him....

12:55.939 --> 12:57.099
..who is it?

13:06.339 --> 13:08.219
Why are you looking at my phone?

13:08.259 --> 13:09.659
I'm not.

13:09.699 --> 13:11.539
I saw you had a message from Katz.

13:11.579 --> 13:13.379
Assumed you'd like to see it.

13:15.019 --> 13:16.299
I'm sorry.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.899
Sorry. I'm... just...

13:21.939 --> 13:23.819
You don't have to apologise...

13:23.859 --> 13:25.859
with all the stuff that's going on.

13:25.899 --> 13:28.259
Your dad messaged you

13:28.299 --> 13:29.659
and you had to go and see him.

13:29.699 --> 13:31.859
I'm just surprised
you didn't tell me.

13:32.939 --> 13:35.699
We both know how damaging
secrets can be.

13:37.379 --> 13:38.659
I believe him.

13:38.699 --> 13:40.899
That he didn't kill George.
Sure.

13:40.939 --> 13:44.339
But the longer he's on the run,
the more guilty he appears to be.

13:45.419 --> 13:48.499
It would probably be best
if he turned himself in.

13:50.139 --> 13:53.299
I admire your loyalty, though.

13:58.019 --> 13:59.179
OK?

14:11.459 --> 14:14.019
No, I don't know who it is but,
um...

14:14.059 --> 14:17.659
maybe this private detective
I've hired can get more information.

14:19.219 --> 14:21.379
Will she speak to me?
Well, I don't know.

14:21.419 --> 14:22.899
Or Claire?

14:25.419 --> 14:26.619
Did you sleep with her?

14:26.659 --> 14:28.219
We've been through this, Ed.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.819
She needed someone to talk to,
listen to, cos you'd disappeared.

14:35.019 --> 14:36.779
Did you sleep with her?

14:37.819 --> 14:39.579
No.

14:39.619 --> 14:42.339
I'd do anything for her...

14:42.379 --> 14:44.699
cos she's my best mate's wife.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.339
And I love her...

14:47.379 --> 14:49.499
like I love you.

14:49.539 --> 14:50.899
That's it.

14:54.379 --> 14:56.219
Now, Claire...

14:56.259 --> 14:58.459
deserves the truth.

15:01.899 --> 15:03.419
Can you get her to see me?

15:11.619 --> 15:12.939
Just nipping out.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.139
Didn't the detective say
we should stay here?

15:15.179 --> 15:16.379
Yes, but we need some things.

15:16.419 --> 15:17.859
Well, shouldn't YOU stay here?

15:17.899 --> 15:19.699
I'll be where I want to be.

15:19.739 --> 15:21.099
Is that all right with you, Ryan?

15:31.059 --> 15:34.179

15:50.219 --> 15:51.739
Ah.

16:03.859 --> 16:04.899
Bob was right.

16:08.739 --> 16:11.019
When Josh died, I...

16:11.059 --> 16:13.779
I ran away.
You shut me out.

16:17.259 --> 16:19.899
I want to tell you the truth.
Oh!

16:23.099 --> 16:24.339
Should've told you years ago

16:24.379 --> 16:26.299
but I was too scared
of what you might think.

16:29.819 --> 16:31.499
There was a junior officer...

16:33.379 --> 16:35.819
..on HMS Leavenstone in 1994.

16:37.659 --> 16:39.259
When that photo was taken?

16:40.899 --> 16:42.539
His name was Baxter.

16:43.579 --> 16:45.939
He was tough. He took no prisoners.

16:45.979 --> 16:47.979
He was only doing his job
but we didn't like it.

16:48.019 --> 16:49.139
We didn't like him.

16:51.499 --> 16:53.139
He didn't deserve what happened.

16:55.659 --> 16:58.699
It was the last night in Gibraltar.

16:58.739 --> 17:02.059
'Out on the piss.
There was me and Arthur, Des...

17:02.099 --> 17:05.179
'Craig Passarello living it large.'

17:06.219 --> 17:08.099
On the way back to the ship...

17:10.059 --> 17:11.259
..there he was.

17:14.259 --> 17:16.819
Sub-lieutenant Nicholas Baxter.

17:18.659 --> 17:19.779
All alone.

17:29.379 --> 17:30.819
I'm watching you.

17:40.019 --> 17:42.379
You playing, then, or what? Come on.

17:47.219 --> 17:48.379
Spades.

17:57.699 --> 17:59.819
We only meant to scare him,

17:59.859 --> 18:01.099
wind him up,

18:01.139 --> 18:02.579
make him feel like we felt.

18:04.659 --> 18:06.259
It all got out of hand.

18:08.619 --> 18:10.379
What did you do?

18:10.419 --> 18:11.979
We went at him.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.379
Shouting, screaming.

18:19.179 --> 18:20.899
Cornered him.

18:23.379 --> 18:26.139
We knew we were gonna get in serious
trouble, but we couldn't stop.

18:28.179 --> 18:29.699
But then he pushed through.

18:31.859 --> 18:33.499
And suddenly he was in the water.

18:36.459 --> 18:38.859
And he didn't come back up again.

18:38.899 --> 18:41.419
And I dived in, like, to get him,
and...

18:47.659 --> 18:51.579
..I kept going deeper, deeper.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.059
I couldn't find him.

19:01.499 --> 19:04.459
And they found him
early the next morning. He...

19:06.179 --> 19:07.219
He drowned.

19:08.699 --> 19:11.539
He cracked his skull -
he must have hit something.

19:13.339 --> 19:15.019
We made a pact.

19:19.619 --> 19:21.779
We saw nothing, we heard nothing,
we did nothing.

19:21.819 --> 19:23.299
Oh, Ed!

19:23.339 --> 19:24.699
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

19:30.019 --> 19:32.259
We put some cocaine
under his bunk...

19:33.859 --> 19:36.379
..to make it look like
he'd been off his face or something.

19:37.899 --> 19:39.539
You can blame the drink,

19:39.579 --> 19:41.339
blame Craig, whose idea it was.

19:41.379 --> 19:43.379
You can blame any one of them.

19:43.419 --> 19:46.059
I was there, Claire.

19:46.099 --> 19:47.459
I took part.

19:49.139 --> 19:50.699
I am guilty.

19:52.139 --> 19:54.099
I am.

19:57.539 --> 19:58.699
I'm sorry.

19:59.739 --> 20:01.339
Sorry, Claire.

20:14.619 --> 20:18.179
CLAIRE:This is why you felt
so guilty when Josh drowned.

20:18.219 --> 20:21.539
ED: Yeah, I... I thought
I was being punished for...

20:21.579 --> 20:22.819
For what we did.

20:32.179 --> 20:34.059
My baby.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.339
How long did Pauline say she'd be?

20:48.379 --> 20:51.299
You spent all that money
on a private detective.

20:51.339 --> 20:53.699
Well, I was hoping that
Pauline might find something out.

20:53.739 --> 20:56.059
What the fuck are we doing, Ed?

20:56.099 --> 20:57.099
Claire?

20:59.019 --> 21:00.339
I don't know you.

21:03.019 --> 21:04.539
What do I do?

21:06.139 --> 21:08.139
Claire, I-I...

21:09.899 --> 21:12.059
VEHICLE APPROACHES
Who's that?

21:17.259 --> 21:18.979
That's her.

21:24.259 --> 21:25.419
That's your lot.

21:33.699 --> 21:34.899
What does it say?

21:35.979 --> 21:38.299
"The officer that was found dead
in Gibraltar

21:38.339 --> 21:40.739
"was Sub-lieutenant
Nicholas Baxter."

21:44.019 --> 21:45.259
What?

21:46.739 --> 21:49.099
"He had a four-year-old son,
Karl Baxter..."

21:51.499 --> 21:54.859
"Who, at the age of 18,
changed his name to...

21:59.899 --> 22:03.939
"..Ryan Wilson."

22:12.259 --> 22:15.059
THEY TALK QUIETLY

22:16.619 --> 22:18.859
PHYLLIS: I saw you.

22:18.899 --> 22:22.779
I saw you with Ed's knife
down by the bins.

22:24.539 --> 22:25.779
Are you sure it was me?

22:25.819 --> 22:27.459
I saw you, yes.

22:28.579 --> 22:30.979
Might be your brain again.
No, no.

22:31.019 --> 22:32.979
Just sit down...

22:33.019 --> 22:34.619
and drink your tea.

22:40.099 --> 22:41.179
Good girl.

22:48.819 --> 22:50.979
Will you tell them that your dad
was at the church?

22:51.019 --> 22:53.459
They think he's killed another man.
They've got evidence.

22:53.499 --> 22:54.939
And you don't believe him?

22:54.979 --> 22:57.539
The longer he's on the run,
the more guilty he appears to be.

22:57.579 --> 23:00.019
Is that what Ryan's told you?

23:00.059 --> 23:01.499
I wonder if we should
go look for him.

23:01.539 --> 23:03.539
So you can turn him in?

23:03.579 --> 23:06.339
So we can talk to him, help him.

23:06.379 --> 23:09.419
It's only a matter of time
before the police find him.

23:09.459 --> 23:11.139
Better us than them.

23:12.419 --> 23:14.859
And I think I know
where he might be.

23:14.899 --> 23:17.059
Where?
You want to come with?

23:17.099 --> 23:18.259
What about Nan?

23:19.939 --> 23:21.179
Katz, would you mind?

23:21.219 --> 23:23.979
Maybe we should all stay here.
Claire said she would be back soon.

23:24.019 --> 23:26.379
We won't be gone for long,
I promise.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.379
Thank you, Katz.

23:29.419 --> 23:30.459
Abbie...

23:30.499 --> 23:32.939
You'll be fine - Katz is here.

23:37.939 --> 23:39.659
I should've listened to you.

23:40.779 --> 23:43.379
I was completely blindsided by him.
PHONE LINE RINGS OUT

23:44.499 --> 23:46.179
Why isn't she answering?

23:59.339 --> 24:00.979
Where else could he go?

24:01.019 --> 24:02.859
I told him
where we put the spare key.

24:05.859 --> 24:07.219
Have you seen my phone?

24:07.259 --> 24:08.579
Did you leave it at your nan's?

24:15.099 --> 24:16.219
Dad?

24:19.379 --> 24:20.979
Ed?

24:21.019 --> 24:22.259
Dad?

24:23.659 --> 24:24.859
Dad?

24:29.699 --> 24:31.059
He's not here.

24:32.459 --> 24:34.099
If I had my phone, I could call him.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.979
Maybe he turned his phone off.

24:36.019 --> 24:39.019
Yeah, but I still need to
call my mum, find out where she is.

24:40.819 --> 24:42.299
SHE SIGHS

24:42.339 --> 24:43.539
Maybe I left it in the car.

25:28.619 --> 25:30.739
No.

25:30.779 --> 25:31.939
George.

25:41.539 --> 25:42.579
SHE SCREAMS

25:45.499 --> 25:47.979
Ryan blames you for what happened.

25:48.019 --> 25:50.459
Not just to his dad,
but his mum killing herself.

25:50.499 --> 25:52.659
Well, why didn't he kill me
when he had the chance?

25:52.699 --> 25:55.419
From the moment I first met him,
I knew something was...

25:55.459 --> 25:57.859
If you had just been honest
in the first place...

25:57.899 --> 25:59.539
Wh-What you doing?

26:05.379 --> 26:06.579
Give me the phone.

26:06.619 --> 26:08.459
RYAN: Sit.

26:08.499 --> 26:09.659
SIT!

26:12.739 --> 26:14.899
We need to get back!
We need to call the police.

26:18.379 --> 26:19.659
PHONE RINGS

26:19.699 --> 26:20.899
It's Ryan.

26:23.819 --> 26:26.019
HE SIGHS AND STUTTERS

26:26.059 --> 26:28.219
What are you gonna say to him?
I don't know.

26:32.019 --> 26:33.499
Hello?

26:34.659 --> 26:35.819
ABBIE:'Hi, Mum.'

26:37.019 --> 26:38.379
Abbie.

26:38.419 --> 26:39.779
'Are you on speakerphone?'

26:43.059 --> 26:44.459
'What's happened?'

26:44.499 --> 26:45.979
Er, I lost my phone.

26:46.019 --> 26:47.699
I'm... I'm using Ryan's.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.939
'Where are you?'

26:49.979 --> 26:51.859
Heading home.

26:53.499 --> 26:54.819
Are you with Nan?

26:55.939 --> 26:57.219
'Katz is with her.'

26:59.779 --> 27:01.539
Abbie...

27:01.579 --> 27:03.419
'Are you OK, darling?'

27:05.619 --> 27:07.019
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:08.339 --> 27:10.339
RYAN:'Hi, Claire.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.699
'We're worried about you.'

27:12.819 --> 27:14.939
Oh, Ryan. Hi.

27:14.979 --> 27:16.019
I'm fine.

27:17.099 --> 27:18.219
'You sure?'

27:21.059 --> 27:23.979
Just a bit worried... I guess.

27:24.019 --> 27:27.299
WHISPERS: We need to get him
away from Abbie.

27:28.499 --> 27:29.659
Why don't you come over?

27:31.339 --> 27:32.779
I'll make us some dinner.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.779
'We can open up the champagne -

27:35.819 --> 27:39.139
'celebrate the engagement properly.'

27:41.379 --> 27:43.579
You'd like that, wouldn't you,
Abbie?

27:45.179 --> 27:47.619
'Did you know
that Abbie met with Ed?

27:47.659 --> 27:50.459
'Katz also met with him.

27:50.499 --> 27:51.859
'She gave him money.'

27:53.579 --> 27:55.139
Earlier, in the house,

27:55.179 --> 27:57.379
you were definitely
hiding something.

28:00.899 --> 28:01.939
How you doing, Karl?

28:02.979 --> 28:04.139
Dad?

28:05.219 --> 28:07.499
You gonna talk to me, Karl?
Go on, I dare you.

28:08.659 --> 28:10.819
'Arthur and Craig -
they were easy, weren't they?

28:10.859 --> 28:12.099
'They didn't see you coming.'

28:12.139 --> 28:15.299
But I saw you from
the first moment we met.

28:15.339 --> 28:19.539
'You took my hand, remember?
And you challenged me.'

28:19.579 --> 28:20.939
Well, I'm...

28:20.979 --> 28:23.419
I'm challenging you now.

28:23.459 --> 28:25.619
Come on - just you and me.

28:27.579 --> 28:28.819
Where are you, Ed?

28:28.859 --> 28:31.299
I'm going to go and see Arthur.

28:32.339 --> 28:34.459
'I think you know where that is.'

28:36.499 --> 28:38.659
Get off me. Get off me.

28:38.699 --> 28:40.179
GET OFF ME!

28:40.219 --> 28:41.739
DISCONNECTION TONE

28:42.859 --> 28:45.019
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

28:45.059 --> 28:46.739
Darling... Claire, Claire...

28:47.859 --> 28:49.659
I know what I'm doing.

28:49.699 --> 28:51.419
Please... trust me.

28:54.539 --> 28:57.059
I love you. I love you.

29:08.379 --> 29:11.459
SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC

29:57.819 --> 30:00.899
Did Abbie tell you this is where
my father's ashes are scattered?

30:01.939 --> 30:03.699
Where is she?

30:03.739 --> 30:04.779
Home.

30:05.819 --> 30:07.739
She's the only reason
you're still alive.

30:09.459 --> 30:10.579
If you've hurt her...

30:10.619 --> 30:12.299
What are you gonna do, Ed?

30:13.619 --> 30:14.779
Kill me...

30:15.819 --> 30:17.259
..like you killed my father?

30:20.739 --> 30:22.339
This is for you.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.219
Here we go.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.059
Oh, my stupid head!

30:30.099 --> 30:32.259
I should have warned her.
What?

30:32.299 --> 30:34.459
Abbie? What do you mean?
Ryan!

30:35.459 --> 30:36.819
He'll soon be down to the harbour.

30:36.859 --> 30:38.859
He told me not to tell Claire
he was there.

30:38.899 --> 30:40.299
I knew he was up to something.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.659
We have to save her.

30:42.699 --> 30:43.859
PHONE LINE RINGS OUT

30:48.419 --> 30:50.579
She's not answering.
Oh, God!

31:03.099 --> 31:04.939
Were you the one who pushed him?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.379
No-one pushed him.

31:08.419 --> 31:10.339
Oh, no.

31:10.379 --> 31:13.419
Accidental death.
Yeah, Des told me everything.

31:14.699 --> 31:16.259
Des?

31:17.579 --> 31:19.579
A year ago...

31:19.619 --> 31:20.739
he wrote to me.

31:22.299 --> 31:24.019
He said he had
something to tell me.

31:25.899 --> 31:28.019
You know he was a Catholic, right?

31:28.059 --> 31:30.219
Hadn't gone to confession
in over 20 years.

31:30.259 --> 31:31.939
Arthur went to see him. I always...

31:31.979 --> 31:34.739
Needed to get something
off his chest.

31:36.299 --> 31:38.459
By all accounts,
he died a happy man.

31:42.219 --> 31:44.059
What would your last words be, Ed?

31:46.379 --> 31:49.059
I-I dived in. I tried to save him.

31:50.099 --> 31:51.739
You couldn't save my father.

31:52.899 --> 31:55.139
You couldn't save your own son.

32:02.139 --> 32:03.379
"Guilty."

32:09.179 --> 32:10.579
Did Des give you that?

32:12.979 --> 32:15.419
My father took this photo.

32:15.459 --> 32:17.939
DISTORTED LAUGHTER

32:26.259 --> 32:27.699
I found a camera

32:27.739 --> 32:31.259
amongst the things that were
sent back when my dad died.

32:31.299 --> 32:33.819
A roll of film.

32:33.859 --> 32:35.379
And there you all were.

32:37.339 --> 32:40.459
You know, I stupidly thought that
he took this because he liked you.

32:41.699 --> 32:43.059
His favourite crew.

32:46.179 --> 32:47.459
Where's Arthur?

32:51.219 --> 32:53.019
I hope to bury all four of you
up here.

32:57.019 --> 32:58.419
How did you kill him?

32:59.539 --> 33:01.259
Same way I killed Craig.

33:12.859 --> 33:17.179
I am genuinely sorry
for what happened to your father.

33:17.219 --> 33:18.659
If I had my time....

33:18.699 --> 33:20.339
HE BREATHES SHAKILY

33:24.939 --> 33:27.059
You know, I barely remember him.

33:27.099 --> 33:28.939
The smoke on his breath.

33:31.339 --> 33:33.459
The scratch of his beard.

33:36.619 --> 33:37.779
But my mother...

33:40.299 --> 33:41.939
..and the shame of it all...

33:43.739 --> 33:47.939
..that he should be painted
as some kind of drug addict,

33:47.979 --> 33:49.659
who deserved what happened?

33:51.499 --> 33:53.299
Drugs planted by you...

33:53.339 --> 33:55.499
and your comrades!

33:55.539 --> 33:56.739
Argh!

33:59.219 --> 34:01.979
I tried to be enough for her.

34:08.979 --> 34:10.899
I found her body.

34:10.939 --> 34:12.619
I was ten.

34:14.779 --> 34:17.019
Sleeping pills in a puddle of vodka.

34:19.579 --> 34:22.779
And I hated them
for what they did to me.

34:24.739 --> 34:26.419
I lied about who I was.

34:28.779 --> 34:30.979
And then Des writes me a letter.

34:33.219 --> 34:35.099
RYAN CHUCKLES SOFTLY

34:35.139 --> 34:37.139
Ryan.

34:37.179 --> 34:38.339
Ryan, please.

34:38.379 --> 34:40.579
No more hiding, Ed.

35:06.699 --> 35:08.899
Abbie?

35:08.939 --> 35:10.499
MUFFLED SHOUTING
Abbie.

35:10.539 --> 35:11.739
Abbie!

35:12.939 --> 35:15.619
MUFFLED:In here!
Abbie, my...

35:15.659 --> 35:17.299
Get the knife!

35:20.499 --> 35:22.739
What's happened? Where's Ryan?

35:25.499 --> 35:27.299
Call the police.
I did.

35:27.339 --> 35:28.979
Get them to Cary Point.

35:30.099 --> 35:31.499
Police.

35:31.539 --> 35:32.819
Yes. Abbie!

35:33.859 --> 35:35.739
Abbie! Abbie!

35:42.579 --> 35:44.699
HE PANTS

35:50.739 --> 35:52.179
WHISTLING

35:53.939 --> 35:56.139
RYAN:This isn't the sea, is it, Ed?

35:56.179 --> 35:57.699
This is my domain.
SNAPPING

35:58.899 --> 36:01.619
Good old-fashioned terra firma.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.219
Four months ago, I came to kill you.

36:05.539 --> 36:07.899
I was waiting for your boat
to come in.

36:07.939 --> 36:10.139
And who should come along?

36:11.499 --> 36:14.219
She said she was waiting
for her dad.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.299
You.

36:16.939 --> 36:21.779
So I suggested that we went
for a drink while she waited.

36:22.899 --> 36:25.019
Love at first sight!

36:25.059 --> 36:26.859
You never loved her!

36:26.899 --> 36:27.979
I do love her.

36:30.859 --> 36:32.179
Like a cancer.

36:34.099 --> 36:35.979
I sabotaged your boat, Ed.

36:37.139 --> 36:38.699
Saltwater in the diesel.

36:38.739 --> 36:39.899
What, in the tank?

36:39.939 --> 36:44.779
I have to say, I thought using
a prostitute was a stroke of genius.

36:44.819 --> 36:46.419
I'm free tonight.

36:46.459 --> 36:48.779
Any time. Whatever works for you.

36:53.299 --> 36:54.979
I can't wait to see you.

36:55.019 --> 36:58.179
I loved how you thought that
by using Bob's van

36:58.219 --> 37:00.059
you would somehow...

37:00.099 --> 37:02.259
be invisible?
HE SCOFFS

37:02.299 --> 37:04.459
Watching you in that restaurant -

37:04.499 --> 37:07.379
YOUR whole world falling apart.

37:07.419 --> 37:09.899
I don't know what you think
you heard, Ed,

37:09.939 --> 37:12.539
but all I was trying to do
was help someone in need.

37:13.859 --> 37:18.299
The disgrace in Abbie's eyes,

37:18.339 --> 37:21.859
as she realised that
her precious daddy...

37:21.899 --> 37:26.419
had completely fucked up.

37:37.019 --> 37:39.539
Putting the lifeguard hoodie on

37:39.579 --> 37:42.259
to make myself look like George
on the pub camera...

37:42.299 --> 37:43.499
I wasn't gonna show you this,

37:43.539 --> 37:46.499
but I think George posted it
through our letterbox.

37:46.539 --> 37:48.099
He's making us all paranoid.

37:48.139 --> 37:51.419
Cutting my hand. Poor me.

37:53.459 --> 37:55.059
RYAN GRUNTS

37:55.099 --> 37:57.499
Planting the gutting knife...

37:58.699 --> 38:00.459
..when Claire went for a swim.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.499
Everything bad
that's happened to you...

38:04.539 --> 38:05.739
is because of me.

38:07.899 --> 38:09.499
And now...

38:09.539 --> 38:11.299
I've finally got you.

38:14.619 --> 38:15.659
Hook...

38:16.859 --> 38:18.099
..line...

38:18.139 --> 38:19.379
and sinker.

38:25.019 --> 38:26.859
I was impressed with George.

38:26.899 --> 38:28.579
He really got close.

38:34.499 --> 38:37.059
Is that why you stabbed him
in the back of the neck?

38:47.059 --> 38:48.739
You're to blame, Ed.

38:50.139 --> 38:51.859
Des has paid his price.

38:51.899 --> 38:54.459
Arthur and Craig have paid theirs.

38:55.859 --> 38:57.699
ED GROANS

38:57.739 --> 38:59.859
And now you pay yours.

39:01.699 --> 39:02.939
Argh!

39:16.379 --> 39:18.499
There's nowhere to go.

39:20.819 --> 39:22.299
No-one to save you.

39:25.459 --> 39:26.499
It's over.

39:27.779 --> 39:28.979
NO!

39:39.299 --> 39:40.539
What are you gonna do with that?

39:40.579 --> 39:42.379
No, Abbie. Don't.

39:42.419 --> 39:43.979
He killed George.
He was gonna kill you.

39:44.019 --> 39:45.899
It's him you should be killing...

39:45.939 --> 39:47.939
not me.

39:50.099 --> 39:52.459
SHE GASPS AND PANTS

39:52.499 --> 39:53.939

There we go. That's it.

Oh, my love. Come on.

40:29.259 --> 40:31.939
That's it. It's all right.
All right.

40:46.379 --> 40:48.339
It's all right. Sh-sh-sh.

41:24.579 --> 41:26.059
You all set, then?

41:26.099 --> 41:28.939
Passport, charger, money.

41:35.299 --> 41:37.819
They said I might
have to come back for the trial.

41:37.859 --> 41:39.659
Ah, well, er, Ryan's pleaded guilty,

41:39.699 --> 41:41.899
so there shouldn't be a trial.

41:43.539 --> 41:45.539
And what about you...

41:45.579 --> 41:47.379
and Ryan's dad?

41:48.379 --> 41:50.779
Well, I...
I made a statement, so, er...

41:54.099 --> 41:55.579
..I'll take what comes.

41:59.419 --> 42:01.579
I love you, Dad.

THEY CHUCKLE

42:41.299 --> 42:43.219
Abbie... little something for you,

42:43.259 --> 42:46.859
just a little bit of
spending money, really.

42:46.899 --> 42:49.419
And don't you forget to send me
a postcard, now, be sure.

42:49.459 --> 42:51.619
Thanks, Nan!
All right, my love.

42:53.339 --> 42:55.939
Claire, just want to thank you -

42:55.979 --> 42:57.659
you know, for...

42:57.699 --> 42:59.339
well, for looking after me.

42:59.379 --> 43:03.819
I can only guess how difficult
that must be sometimes for you.

43:03.859 --> 43:06.739
Oh, Mum.
I love you.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.979
I'll be back in two minutes.
Yeah.

43:13.219 --> 43:14.739
You look amazing.

43:17.499 --> 43:19.259
It's not going to be easy, Ed.

43:21.299 --> 43:23.259
I know, but it...
it feels different.

43:25.139 --> 43:26.379
I feel different.

43:27.979 --> 43:29.699
No more secrets.

43:31.299 --> 43:33.019
Let's see how we go, yeah?

43:54.139 --> 43:55.379
Abbie?

43:58.979 --> 44:00.819
Just felt so right.

44:00.859 --> 44:02.179
Him.

44:04.579 --> 44:06.059
Everything made sense.

44:08.219 --> 44:10.099
Ryan's in the past now.

44:11.219 --> 44:13.659
Locked up, safe and sound.
