00:57.737 --> 00:59.625
Mama look!

00:59.721 --> 01:02.218
That looks awesome Zoey!

01:05.385 --> 01:09.321
Why do bad things happen to
good people?

01:10.345 --> 01:13.034
Mama can we get ice cream on
the way home?

01:13.065 --> 01:15.305
No ma'am you were going
straight to bed.

01:15.402 --> 01:17.418
Please?

01:17.770 --> 01:19.338
Please?

01:20.426 --> 01:25.098
Have you ever done something
that really hurt someone?

01:27.625 --> 01:31.529
Maybe you've
broken someone's heart.

01:31.561 --> 01:34.441
Or done something that you feel
is completely unforgivable.

01:34.473 --> 01:39.241
Think you're too good for me
huh bitch? I'll show you!

01:40.681 --> 01:46.441
Well the question is why doesn't God
stop those bad things from happening?

01:49.897 --> 01:53.481
I mean, He is God right?

01:55.210 --> 01:59.465
It's because, God has given us
freewill.

02:00.169 --> 02:04.937
He gives us the choice to love
or hurt others.

02:19.882 --> 02:25.546
You see we live in a world, people
broken by choosing sin over the Savior.

02:33.450 --> 02:40.138
And a lifestyle of sin, without
repentance, will always lead to death.

02:48.265 --> 02:51.112
Ultimately, it's your choice.

03:55.050 --> 03:57.417
Anything good in the
mail this morning?

03:57.674 --> 04:01.386
Uh, no, you didn't, you didn't
get the mail?

04:02.346 --> 04:03.466
Hmmm um.

04:05.386 --> 04:06.666
Huh?

04:08.010 --> 04:09.129
Hey Zoe!

04:09.162 --> 04:10.249
Yeah?

04:10.282 --> 04:13.225
How's school been treatin you?

04:13.386 --> 04:15.114
Fine.

04:17.385 --> 04:20.745
You wanna do this
the hard way, huh?

04:32.809 --> 04:34.857
So is there something you want
to talk about?

04:34.890 --> 04:36.969
Yeah! You said you was gonna
make me some pancakes!

04:37.002 --> 04:38.218
I ain't talking to you Kooter!

04:38.250 --> 04:39.401
Well apparently you ain't
cooking for me neither!

04:39.434 --> 04:41.130
Don't you have a wife?

04:41.161 --> 04:45.321
I can't go home right now my wife's boyfriend's
in town and she doesn't like me very much.

04:45.738 --> 04:47.978
Kooter she never liked you, alright?
Now go put a damn shirt on.

04:48.010 --> 04:50.025
- What are you talking about! I worked out!
- I'll cook for you Kooter.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.202
Thank you very much darling,
now was that so hard?

04:52.936 --> 04:55.881
Zoe, something you need to talk
about or not?

04:57.674 --> 05:00.745
Nope, but hey, thanks for
asking.

05:06.345 --> 05:09.738
What are you doing skipping
school Zoe?

05:10.890 --> 05:12.649
Ryan, chill!

05:13.001 --> 05:14.474
No I'm not gonna chill.

05:14.506 --> 05:18.794
Me and your brother used to skip school,
Mrs. Wright's class all the time!

05:18.825 --> 05:20.618
Kooter come on man, shut up.

05:21.385 --> 05:25.354
See it's really not that big of
a deal Ryan, who cares?

05:25.481 --> 05:28.009
I care, alright I'm not working my
ass off everyday to take care you.

05:28.042 --> 05:29.929
I want to know what your doing.

05:29.962 --> 05:33.769
You wanna know what? What do you
think I'm doing drugs or something?

05:33.802 --> 05:34.985
Are you?

05:35.018 --> 05:39.498
Oh my God! No, no I'm not doing
drugs, I'm not drinking

05:39.529 --> 05:42.249
and I'm definitely not having
sex with strangers.

05:42.378 --> 05:43.849
Yerp!

05:44.138 --> 05:45.993
You happy?

05:46.218 --> 05:49.737
Ryan, could you be a normal
brother for one day?

05:50.697 --> 05:53.769
What would mom say about this?

05:59.306 --> 06:00.553
Zoe look it's my job....

06:00.586 --> 06:04.650
No, it's not Ryan! I am not
your job,

06:04.681 --> 06:07.946
you are not dad and you are definitely
not mom, so just shut up!

06:08.042 --> 06:12.138
I'm almost 18, I don't need you looking over my
shoulder telling me everything I'm doing wrong!

06:12.330 --> 06:14.250
I'm not Zoe! Hey!

06:18.889 --> 06:20.713
Hey you know a man don't even
worry about it,

06:20.746 --> 06:23.145
we did the same things growing
up and look how we turned out.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.346
It's exactly what I'm worried
about man.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.946
What am I gonna do
with her?

06:42.089 --> 06:44.105
Ryan Stevens?

06:45.642 --> 06:47.562
Long time son.

06:47.978 --> 06:50.890
Pastor Dave sorry I just let
myself in.

06:51.050 --> 06:54.986
I know, I watched out of camera
the whole time.

06:55.017 --> 06:57.514
You forget which day of the
week church is on son?

06:57.866 --> 07:02.154
No sir. I just, ahhh,
I just got a lot on my mind lately.

07:02.185 --> 07:06.697
Hmm, a whole lot of different
stuff or just one big thing?

07:06.729 --> 07:08.809
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

07:08.842 --> 07:13.065
Hmmmm. I ain't seen you around
here in almost a decade,

07:13.096 --> 07:15.562
and you want me to pretend that
you came over here to, what?

07:15.594 --> 07:17.514
Stare at the wall?

07:17.705 --> 07:20.521
You know what I didn't mean for you
to come down here so if you wanna ...?

07:20.554 --> 07:23.530
Well, it's kind of what I do.
It's my job.

07:24.202 --> 07:27.209
So, come on. What's up?

07:29.290 --> 07:32.393
It's uh. It's my sister, Zoe.

07:34.377 --> 07:37.322
Zoe. Wow.

07:37.609 --> 07:40.137
She must be grown up huh? What,
Sixteen?

07:40.170 --> 07:41.418
Seventeen.

07:41.609 --> 07:42.825
Seventeen.

07:43.785 --> 07:45.866
That means I'm getting old.

07:46.314 --> 07:48.394
I wasn't gonna say anything.

07:48.425 --> 07:50.314
She still a little angel?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.434
Hell no.

07:51.465 --> 07:53.129
Hey, watch your mouth ok?

07:53.161 --> 07:54.314
Sorry.

07:54.345 --> 07:56.553
If you brought her around the
church sometime, ya know...

07:56.649 --> 08:00.137
No offense pastor but she wouldn't
step foot in here if I paid her.

08:00.170 --> 08:02.985
Ouch. So what's the deal?

08:03.369 --> 08:08.841
Uh, well, the deal is I have no idea what
I'm doing trying to raise a teenage girl.

08:09.481 --> 08:12.810
She won't listen to a word I
say. Alright?

08:13.162 --> 08:16.650
And we fight every single time
we try to talk, and, umm...

08:16.682 --> 08:19.466
this morning I get a letter from her
school saying that she's been skipping

08:19.497 --> 08:22.121
two or three days a week and I
can actually go to jail for that.

08:23.753 --> 08:28.137
Hmm. Well, just kick her out
then. Get rid of her.

08:28.618 --> 08:30.442
I can't do that.

08:30.825 --> 08:34.057
That's good.
There's still hope then

08:36.520 --> 08:38.537
Teenage girls.

08:40.073 --> 08:44.938
One of God's most precious gifts and
harshest punishment all rolled into one.

08:45.865 --> 08:48.105
See but here's the thing;

08:49.995 --> 08:53.161
she wants you to listen to her.

08:56.329 --> 09:00.585
She needs to know that you care
and deep deep down

09:01.385 --> 09:05.322
she's yearning for guidance and
discipline.

09:08.713 --> 09:10.921
You see that right there,
that's why I stopped coming to church.

09:10.954 --> 09:11.849
Hmm?

09:11.881 --> 09:14.025
You lie too much.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.402
Hey.

09:16.778 --> 09:20.137
And no matter how hard she pushes
back you gotta stand your ground.

09:20.970 --> 09:23.082
And you got to fight for her.

09:24.906 --> 09:29.769
Who else is gonna do it, huh?
Right? Right?

09:31.978 --> 09:36.201
And then one day you look at
her eyes..

09:36.233 --> 09:40.489
and you'll suddenly realize
she's all grown up.

09:41.835 --> 09:44.041
And she don't need you any more.

09:44.073 --> 09:48.425
And at that moment you'll know
that it's ok...

09:48.458 --> 09:50.378
to let her go.

09:52.073 --> 09:54.953
But until then...

09:56.361 --> 09:58.250
Sound good?

09:58.281 --> 10:00.617
Hell no. It sounds awful.

10:00.745 --> 10:03.337
That's twice now. Watch out!

10:03.369 --> 10:05.930
How many more strikes until you
leave me alone?

10:05.961 --> 10:09.353
A hell of a lot! A hell of a
lot, son.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.234
Ryan.

10:21.257 --> 10:23.145
Um, Ryan.

10:25.193 --> 10:27.113
Just keep it up.

10:30.473 --> 10:34.953
Your momma and daddy,
they'd be proud.

11:02.793 --> 11:05.481
BOBCATS! BOBCATS!

11:29.577 --> 11:33.641
Tell me one thing are you prepared for the
epicness of what's about to take place?

11:34.825 --> 11:37.035
I was born ready!

11:42.313 --> 11:46.539
So are we gonna like go to the
party or are we just going to sit...

11:47.881 --> 11:49.993
What? What? Did I do something?

11:50.026 --> 11:51.625
No. No. You're fine. You're
fine.

11:51.657 --> 11:53.929
What? What's wrong?

11:54.537 --> 11:56.457
Nothing. It's just.....

11:57.321 --> 11:59.497
promise you're not gonna laugh
at me?

11:59.657 --> 12:01.546
I promise.

12:02.185 --> 12:04.810
I've never been kissed before.

12:07.050 --> 12:09.993
Well, there's a first time for
everything

12:10.026 --> 12:14.537
Wait wait. You really like me,
right?

12:15.049 --> 12:17.002
Duh!

12:17.641 --> 12:21.481
I want to hear you say it,
right now.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.850
I really like you.

12:47.273 --> 12:49.385
What do you want Ryan?

12:49.417 --> 12:51.305
You on your way home?

12:51.337 --> 12:53.642
I'm going to a party with
Micheal.

12:54.346 --> 12:57.579
No I don't think so. You need
to get home.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.499
Ryan, I'm going to the party.

12:59.530 --> 13:03.690
No you're not Zoe. Be here in
thirty minutes. You hear me?

13:03.817 --> 13:08.106
Ryan, I will never ask you for
anything ever again.

13:08.649 --> 13:12.521
No. Be here in thirty minutes.

13:12.553 --> 13:15.754
God! I cannot wait to graduate!
I hate you!

13:19.273 --> 13:24.202
So. So, I guess I'm gonna take
you home then.

13:36.778 --> 13:38.794
I like you too.

13:39.850 --> 13:43.306
Let's go to the party!

14:49.610 --> 14:51.497
Zoe....

14:51.530 --> 14:53.417
Zoe Wait!

14:57.578 --> 14:59.913
Hey! Kill the music.

15:01.258 --> 15:03.625

15:04.970 --> 15:07.369
How could you do that?
You used me.

15:19.754 --> 15:22.250
Micheal! Micheal, wait!

15:33.994 --> 15:35.497
What is wrong with you?!

15:35.529 --> 15:37.610
What the hell Zoe?

15:37.642 --> 15:40.265
You just slapped me in front of
the whole school.

15:40.905 --> 15:43.498
No. No, I gotta go. I gotta go.

15:44.394 --> 15:46.889
Micheal, stop! You have to take
me home.

15:46.921 --> 15:48.554
Everything ok here?

15:48.585 --> 15:51.082
Yeah. Yeah. Everything's great.

Look, I can give you a ride if
you need it.

16:04.842 --> 16:09.258
No, it's ok. My brother will come
pick me up. He's gonna be so pissed.

16:09.290 --> 16:12.362
Ok. I'll go back inside then.

16:23.978 --> 16:25.289

I don't know what you're
talking about. Who is this?

18:39.529 --> 18:43.786
It's her brother, man. She didn't come
home last night. Now where is she?

18:44.618 --> 18:49.257
I don't know. We went to a
party but I left early.

18:49.289 --> 18:51.177
Tell me who
she went home with.

18:51.209 --> 18:53.129
I have no idea, man.

18:54.378 --> 18:56.330
You better not be lying to me,

18:57.258 --> 19:00.649

19:06.154 --> 19:07.593

19:22.474 --> 19:25.769
Hi this is Ryan Stevens. I was
calling about my sister, Zoe?

19:25.801 --> 19:28.874
Tiffany, hey it's Ryan Stevens.
It's Zoe's Brother

19:28.906 --> 19:32.106
Hey Brandy, it is Ryan Stevens.
I am looking for my sister.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.834
McKayla, where is Zoe?

19:33.865 --> 19:35.176
Damn it!

19:36.682 --> 19:38.794
Amber told me she saw you at
the party too! Ok?

19:38.826 --> 19:40.681
I wanna know, did she ride home
with you?

19:40.714 --> 19:42.730
Is she with you or not?

19:51.082 --> 19:54.729
Yes. I need to speak to someone
about a missing person.

19:55.050 --> 19:56.874
Can you please hold?

19:56.970 --> 19:58.825
Yes, I'll hold.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.538
Hello?

20:02.569 --> 20:07.306
Hi! My name is Ryan Stevens and
I'm calling because..

20:07.338 --> 20:09.930
my sister, Zoe, she went to a
party last night

20:09.962 --> 20:12.394
with some friends and I
haven't heard from her

20:12.426 --> 20:14.122
I've called all of her friends
and I have no idea where she went.

20:14.154 --> 20:15.274
Sheriff?

20:15.306 --> 20:16.266
Yeah.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.738
You wanna take this?

20:17.769 --> 20:21.385
A boy says his little sister went to a
party last night and never came home.

20:21.417 --> 20:24.169
Has he checked her boyfriend's
bed yet?

20:24.778 --> 20:27.112
Ha. Probably not. I'll take it.

20:27.145 --> 20:28.778
Alright.

20:28.810 --> 20:33.832
Alright son, here's the deal. She didn't
evaporate so just stay calm. How old is she?

20:33.865 --> 20:36.298
She's seventeen.
What does it matter?

20:36.330 --> 20:38.218
Well it matters cause she's an
adult.

20:38.250 --> 20:42.025
And in the great state of Texas
there's a 48 hour time frame

20:42.058 --> 20:44.361
until we're allowed to file a
missing persons report.

20:44.457 --> 20:45.578
What?

20:45.609 --> 20:47.689
And if you're telling me she
ain't home,

20:47.722 --> 20:49.609
and you've already checked with
all of her friends,

20:49.642 --> 20:51.562
then there's not a whole lot I
can do for you today, son.

20:52.394 --> 20:55.146
There's no law against adults
that skip town.

20:55.369 --> 20:56.937
Listen to me.

20:56.970 --> 21:00.554
I'm telling you that my sister is missing
so can you please just do your damn job?

21:00.649 --> 21:02.954
Hey, you're gonna need to watch
your tone with me, son.

21:02.986 --> 21:06.570
I'm not gonna watch my tone with you! Just
get your ass out there and find my sister!

21:11.658 --> 21:14.442
It's alright man. Come on.
She's fine. Alright?

21:14.474 --> 21:16.969
You're stressing out. You gotta
calm down.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.545
She wouldn't do this Kooter.

21:21.578 --> 21:23.882
This is the same girl we just
got caught skipping school right?

21:24.425 --> 21:26.345
That's normal man. She's
growing up.

21:26.730 --> 21:30.025
You're going to have to let her go.
Ya know, let her make some mistakes. Ok?

21:30.058 --> 21:31.818
Ok? I'll tell you what's going
to happen.

21:31.849 --> 21:35.081
She's gonna sleep til three, not talk to you
all day and that's gonna be the end of it.

21:35.176 --> 21:36.586
Alright? Now can we please go?

21:36.714 --> 21:40.554
Randall beats us to that job site
he's gonna ride our ass all day.

21:40.585 --> 21:41.610
You go ahead.

21:41.641 --> 21:44.233
Fine. But will you do me a
favor?

21:44.266 --> 21:46.665
When you do find her, go easy
on her, huh.

21:47.113 --> 21:49.609
We're gonna laugh about this in
a few days. Im telling you.

22:02.634 --> 22:05.386
Hey man, I was ...I was leaving
the party last night.

22:05.418 --> 22:07.338
I was heading out and this guy
walked up.

22:07.434 --> 22:09.418
And he was talking to Zoe for a
minute when I left.

22:09.450 --> 22:10.696
He was older.
He had blonde hair.

22:10.729 --> 22:12.106
Whoa, whoa. What's his name?

22:12.138 --> 22:13.962
I don't know. I've never seen
him before.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.058
Come with me.

22:18.090 --> 22:19.658
Where are we going?

22:28.266 --> 22:30.186

last night.

23:05.546 --> 23:06.602
You better think.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.265
Hey, hey, it's Marty! He gets
us our drugs! That's it!

23:08.296 --> 23:09.353
Where is he?

23:09.386 --> 23:12.266
He runs the strip club down by
the lake.

23:12.297 --> 23:14.217
Don't tell him I said anything!

23:22.282 --> 23:26.441
Hi sir. How may I help you

easiest to clean?

23:33.482 --> 23:35.241
Can you help me?

23:36.297 --> 23:39.369

Do you hear me?

34:09.705 --> 34:11.562

35:12.265 --> 35:13.514
Yeah.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.594
We gotta make up the difference
somewhere.

35:16.874 --> 35:18.794
Did you grab the envelope with
the new drop site?

35:19.242 --> 35:21.546
No

35:21.578 --> 35:24.170
Dammit. Just drive.

35:38.249 --> 35:40.650
Wait, no no no. What exactly
are we doing? What's the plan here?

35:40.681 --> 35:42.089
We're calling the police right?

35:42.186 --> 35:43.338
I already tried, they're not
interested.

35:43.465 --> 35:44.458
What?

35:44.490 --> 35:45.514
We got this.

35:45.546 --> 35:47.689
I said we got it. Just sit back

35:47.721 --> 35:49.833
Naw man I'm not getting my
head blown off

35:49.866 --> 35:50.826

Captain America bullshit.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.330
That's it, I'm calling 911.

36:21.769 --> 36:25.546
You and me man, we been through
a hell of a lot together..

36:27.338 --> 36:29.258
Hell of a lot, ever since we
were kids.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.649
You're the only brother that
I've ever known.

36:37.802 --> 36:41.481
And Zoe, that girl's my sister so,
if you say we gotta go then we gotta go.

36:41.512 --> 36:43.432
But you gotta tell me what I'm
supposed to do.

36:46.794 --> 36:48.586
Tell me what I should do.

36:57.930 --> 37:01.098
I swore on my parents grave that I
would take good care of her, Kooter.

37:03.818 --> 37:07.018
I mean I have watched her like
a hawk.

37:08.618 --> 37:10.506
She's my responsibility.

37:10.538 --> 37:13.578
I'm not gonna sit here and watch
somebody else go out and save her.

37:14.346 --> 37:16.426
So you wanna go then let's go.

37:16.458 --> 37:18.601
You wanna stay then

37:46.890 --> 37:50.345
Get your ass out. Get out!

37:51.786 --> 37:54.762
Look at me. He said if we called
the cops he would kill em. Alright?

37:54.793 --> 37:57.865
And I don't wanna find my sister
dead on the side of the highway.

37:58.538 --> 38:00.458
If that happens it's gonna be
your fault.

38:51.754 --> 38:53.609
Oh, come on.

39:03.209 --> 39:05.129
It's Zoe.

39:08.905 --> 39:10.058
Is that yours?

39:10.090 --> 39:11.370
Shhhh. I found it.

39:11.945 --> 39:14.121
I can't get any service.
There's only like 7 percent battery.

39:14.282 --> 39:15.498
Call 911.

39:15.594 --> 39:17.834
I tried. It wouldn't go through.

39:18.026 --> 39:19.913
I'm texting my brother.

39:21.897 --> 39:23.657
She's at mile marker 617.

39:23.690 --> 39:25.610

39:25.802 --> 39:28.330
Ok, ok. Here comes the next one.

39:31.114 --> 39:34.058
They're going to Houston.
Come on, Kooter, let's go, step on it!

39:37.353 --> 39:39.754
Put it away before it dies.

39:51.178 --> 39:53.481
Whatcha all up in here doing?

39:53.577 --> 39:55.370
Nothing.

39:55.657 --> 39:57.546
You better be up to doing
nothing.

39:57.577 --> 39:59.306
We're not. We're just...

39:59.337 --> 40:00.905
Oh, shut up.

40:00.938 --> 40:02.858
I'm watching y'all.

40:14.345 --> 40:15.913
He's coming.

40:44.105 --> 40:45.546
Ok, they're stopping.

40:48.874 --> 40:50.665
Everybody out.

41:12.618 --> 41:14.729
That's my profile picture.

41:15.177 --> 41:16.618
That's right.

41:17.193 --> 41:20.106
I grabbed it the other night while we
were chatting about your stupid dad.

41:20.137 --> 41:21.930
Do you remember that?

41:21.961 --> 41:23.530
That was you?

41:23.721 --> 41:25.993
What's the matter? I don't look
like my profile picture?

41:26.026 --> 41:27.946
Different name too.
Don't feel bad.

41:28.169 --> 41:30.537
Have either of you ever heard
of this site before?

41:31.561 --> 41:32.649
No.

41:32.682 --> 41:33.898
Ok. Well it's simple.

41:33.929 --> 41:37.035
I take pictures of pretty
girls, like yourselves,

41:37.065 --> 41:41.226
and I post them and wait for
nice gentlemen to give me a call.

41:42.890 --> 41:45.257
What's that say right there?
How much?

41:45.514 --> 41:46.697
600 dollars.

41:46.730 --> 41:48.490
600 dollars!

41:48.522 --> 41:51.849
When's the last time we had someone
turn six bills on their first trick?

41:53.355 --> 41:54.729
Never.

41:55.114 --> 41:57.290
I think she might take
your name Cash.

41:57.321 --> 41:59.019
Keep dreaming white girl.

41:59.241 --> 42:01.161
I..I don't understand. I
can't.....

42:01.257 --> 42:03.210
We do need to give you a name.

42:04.010 --> 42:05.897
How about.....

42:05.930 --> 42:07.306
Angel?

42:07.337 --> 42:09.770
No. No, I don't need a name.

42:09.801 --> 42:12.073
Ok, ok. Look.

42:12.106 --> 42:14.953
This guy Walter. He's gonna be
here very soon...

42:15.657 --> 42:18.282
and you're going to show this
little pervert a good time.

42:18.889 --> 42:21.257
Now Cash will take the money...

42:21.290 --> 42:23.818
and Damien will be right here to
make sure no one gets out of line.

42:23.849 --> 42:25.705
You don't understand. I
can't...

42:25.738 --> 42:27.113
Oh, hey, Alana!

42:27.145 --> 42:30.186
You just landed yourself a regular.
You're gonna love this guy.

42:30.217 --> 42:31.722
He'll be over this evening.

42:31.755 --> 42:33.418
Looks like we're setting up
shop for the night.

42:33.449 --> 42:34.602
How much?

42:34.635 --> 42:35.817
$250

42:35.850 --> 42:37.577
Ha... $250.

42:38.730 --> 42:41.802
I'll clean up. You keep it down
out here.

42:45.865 --> 42:48.906
You, sit your ass on the couch.

42:56.458 --> 42:58.539
Strip.

42:59.625 --> 43:01.515
What?

43:01.545 --> 43:03.530
Take your clothes off.

43:07.882 --> 43:09.737
Where are you going?

43:10.185 --> 43:11.881
To the bathroom.

43:11.914 --> 43:13.866
Do it right here.

43:15.210 --> 43:17.130
But there's people right here...

43:17.513 --> 43:20.266
Bitch! Did I stutter?

43:21.001 --> 43:23.177
Strip....

43:24.041 --> 43:25.929
Ok.

43:25.961 --> 43:28.906
Ok. Ok. Ok.

44:01.417 --> 44:04.009
Eww, you are tiny.

44:05.929 --> 44:08.266
I guess Marty likes that
kind of stuff.

44:17.993 --> 44:20.713
Oh those are cute lady panties.

44:35.594 --> 44:38.921
Now go to the room and get in
the bed.

44:53.449 --> 44:56.619
Hmmm... Walk a walka walk walk.

45:02.793 --> 45:04.841
He'll be here in 5.

45:04.937 --> 45:06.441
Cool.

45:16.009 --> 45:20.201
Oh God, please save me. Please
save me God.

45:20.233 --> 45:22.153
Please don't let this
happen to me.

45:40.650 --> 45:42.538
Please save me.

45:57.801 --> 45:59.114
Hi.

46:10.570 --> 46:14.282
So, so your name's Angel? Hmmm?

46:18.122 --> 46:21.545
Hey, I've never done this
before, ok.

46:21.577 --> 46:23.497
I'm not a bad guy. I just...

46:25.417 --> 46:28.746
Hey now, don't do that. I don't
want this to be weird.

46:31.881 --> 46:33.769
No! Please stop. Please.

46:34.921 --> 46:37.514
Hey, I thought you girls liked
that sort of thing.

46:39.114 --> 46:40.937
You think I like this?

46:43.497 --> 46:45.353
Ok.

46:45.545 --> 46:47.465
Fine.

46:52.361 --> 46:55.209
Let's just get this over with
then, huh.

47:01.514 --> 47:03.402
Ahh.. no.

47:03.434 --> 47:06.218
Please....Please... ahhh

47:06.986 --> 47:08.906
You have a wife?

47:10.537 --> 47:13.321
Hey, be quiet ok?

47:16.426 --> 47:18.313
Do you have any kids?

47:18.346 --> 47:19.977
Shut up about my family.

47:20.009 --> 47:22.634
Do you have a daughter?

47:22.665 --> 47:24.585
Hey! Stop it!

47:44.905 --> 47:47.753
Three. I got 3 daughters.

47:50.282 --> 47:53.290
And my wife Rita
thinks I'm out fishing.

47:58.794 --> 48:01.353
Hey, please forgive me, alright?

48:01.385 --> 48:03.305
I should have never come here.
I don't know what came over me.

48:04.041 --> 48:05.929
I just gotta go.

48:07.562 --> 48:11.753
Wait. Please you
have to help us.

48:11.785 --> 48:13.418
They're gonna kill us.

48:13.450 --> 48:18.090
Please, I promise I won't tell anybody
about you. I swear just please help us.

48:18.569 --> 48:20.457
I'll see what I can do.

48:26.249 --> 48:27.722
What the hell?

48:27.754 --> 48:29.802
Hey, I'm sorry. I made a big
mistake coming here.

48:29.834 --> 48:32.362
We didn't do anything. Ok? I'm
just gonna go.

48:32.714 --> 48:35.146
Wait hold up.

48:35.178 --> 48:37.098
You ain't paid yet.

48:37.609 --> 48:40.777
Hey. Now like I said we didn't
do anything. I changed my mind.

48:41.737 --> 48:43.657
What's going on Cash?

48:43.689 --> 48:46.921
Mr. I changed my mind is trying
to skate on us.

48:47.145 --> 48:48.522
Is that right?

48:48.554 --> 48:51.658
No. I was gonna pay but we
didn't do anything. All...

48:51.882 --> 48:54.570
Do I look like somebody you
wanna mess with?

48:55.017 --> 48:56.298
No.

49:06.762 --> 49:08.714
It's all there.

49:11.626 --> 49:15.594
Hey, get your broke ass
up out the vehicle.

49:19.113 --> 49:21.033
It was nice doing
business with ya.

49:23.146 --> 49:25.865
Hey hey hey Walter.

49:25.897 --> 49:28.809
I'm so sorry man. Look they're
just trying to scare ya.

49:29.002 --> 49:32.010
Well they did. Listen I am
sorry.

49:32.041 --> 49:34.281
I just wanna get home before my
wife starts asking questions.

49:34.794 --> 49:38.152
I completely understand. Your wife she's
not going to know anything about this.

49:39.337 --> 49:41.257
You sure?

49:41.354 --> 49:43.242
I'm positive.

50:01.898 --> 50:03.818
Cash!

50:07.690 --> 50:12.554
You really think you can assault a
customer and have him not say anything?

50:13.641 --> 50:15.849
You don't think anybody's gonna
ask him what happened?

50:15.882 --> 50:17.802
Are you trying to get us thrown
into prison?

50:19.081 --> 50:22.058
Open the door. Open the door!
Open the door!

50:22.090 --> 50:23.754
Ok!

50:23.785 --> 50:27.721
You see him? You screw up again,
you'll be down there with him.

50:30.666 --> 50:34.889
It's her! It's that girl! We
need to get rid of her.

50:35.114 --> 50:38.410
That girl is worth ten times
more than you ever were.

50:38.442 --> 50:40.362
If I get rid of anyone, I'm
getting rid of you!

50:48.489 --> 50:50.665
Angel will you please
come out here.

51:01.801 --> 51:04.970
Well, everyone, I have good
news.

51:05.994 --> 51:07.914
We're going to be having over a
guest shortly.

51:08.618 --> 51:11.209
What'd you do? Get another hit
on the site?

51:11.433 --> 51:13.289
Guess again.

51:13.321 --> 51:15.241
Angel you wanna
take a crack at it?

51:18.186 --> 51:21.769
Well, our special guest will be
over here shortly..

51:21.801 --> 51:25.162
and we are all going to give
him a very warm welcome.

51:25.737 --> 51:27.114
What do you mean?

51:27.145 --> 51:31.305
Well, I was in there cleaning up
earlier and I happened to find this.

51:33.161 --> 51:35.690
Yeah.

51:36.522 --> 51:39.881
Me and Angel's big brother have been
texting up a storm on this thing.

51:40.105 --> 51:44.138
You remember him. He's the one that
we met at the club this morning...

51:44.169 --> 51:48.330
and let me tell you he cannot
wait to come here to pick me up.

51:49.514 --> 51:52.074
I'm sorry. Pick you up.

51:52.649 --> 51:57.194
Who's waiting all alone in an
abandoned motor home in the woods.

51:58.921 --> 52:01.290
You're a bad man.

52:01.386 --> 52:04.841
Keep it quick and quiet. We don't need people
hearing gun shots and getting curious.

52:04.874 --> 52:06.090
Got it.

52:06.122 --> 52:08.042
Wait please.

52:12.394 --> 52:15.401
Keep begging.
It kinda turns me on.

52:15.434 --> 52:17.354
Why don't you give me a kiss.

52:17.577 --> 52:19.497
Get off me.

52:22.729 --> 52:24.682
Please stop. I'm sorry.

52:24.970 --> 52:26.378
Do you think this is a game?

52:26.409 --> 52:27.466
No

52:27.562 --> 52:29.354
You think were
playing a game here?

52:29.386 --> 52:30.889
No I don't. Please.

52:32.554 --> 52:36.138
That's right you little bitch. From now on,
hey, from now on I want you to call me daddy.

52:37.034 --> 52:38.986
Call me daddy.

52:39.370 --> 52:41.290
You did this to her.

52:41.416 --> 52:43.050
Daddy!

52:43.369 --> 52:44.938
I'm sorry daddy.

52:51.112 --> 52:53.834
Take care of the body. I'll be
in the woods.

53:47.049 --> 53:48.906
Sit down and don't move.

53:58.185 --> 54:00.105
He stopped.

54:03.658 --> 54:06.057
What's going on?

54:06.090 --> 54:08.010
The hell if I know.

54:23.081 --> 54:24.682
Zoe are you in there?

54:24.714 --> 54:27.562
Please just let us go. We wont
say anything I promise.

54:27.594 --> 54:28.649
Shut up!

54:28.681 --> 54:31.082
Zoe, if you're in there it's me.

54:32.138 --> 54:34.026
I will shoot you right now.

54:34.345 --> 54:36.265
Tell him to come in.

54:36.938 --> 54:38.697
No.... NO!

54:38.730 --> 54:40.650
ZOE!

54:40.906 --> 54:41.929
Here he comes.

54:41.962 --> 54:43.849
RYAN NO!

54:43.882 --> 54:47.114
Hey hey hey. Get your hands up!
Get your hands up! Don't you dare move.

54:50.473 --> 54:52.393
No.....

55:17.930 --> 55:19.434
Get off of me!

55:20.233 --> 55:22.153
He'll be alright. Be alright.

56:02.409 --> 56:04.329
Yolo!

56:05.257 --> 56:06.761
Get Zoe!

56:31.785 --> 56:32.715
Ryan?

56:32.745 --> 56:33.961
Zoe! Zoe....

56:33.993 --> 56:36.490
I thought they were going to
kill you!

56:46.889 --> 56:50.121
I thought they were going to kill you.
They got the phone. I wasn't sure.

56:50.538 --> 56:52.745
Lock the door. Don't let anyone
in but me.

56:52.778 --> 56:55.081
No no no. Ryan, please, you
can't leave me.

56:58.409 --> 57:01.866
Hey, sweetheart. Come on back.
I'm gonna whisper something in your ear.

57:16.073 --> 57:17.289
Please... Please

57:17.322 --> 57:19.146
I'll come back. Trust me.

57:21.385 --> 57:24.394
Kooter! Kooter get up! Come on
man, get up!

57:29.737 --> 57:31.561
Alana, come on.

57:32.170 --> 57:33.321
Ryan!

57:33.353 --> 57:35.115
Zoe, what are you doing!

57:35.145 --> 57:37.002
Come on, we gotta get to
the truck!

57:37.035 --> 57:38.955
Come on man let's go!

57:40.010 --> 57:41.482
Get in! Go, go, go!

57:48.361 --> 57:50.570
Whoo!

57:50.601 --> 57:52.330
We did it it man! You alright?

57:52.362 --> 57:53.385
Oh yeah.

57:53.417 --> 57:54.666
In one piece! Hell yeah!

57:54.697 --> 57:55.978
Get me outta here, buddy.

57:56.009 --> 57:57.034
Hang on tight buddy.

57:57.065 --> 57:58.377
Oh, Kooter, thank you so
much!

57:58.410 --> 57:59.433
Oh man, that is my...

58:00.649 --> 58:02.090
Kooter!

58:49.995 --> 58:51.562
Zoe?

58:54.090 --> 58:56.777
Hey, don't move!
Don't you dare move!

58:58.890 --> 59:00.137
Shit!

59:01.770 --> 59:04.585
Hey, we lost another one.

59:05.706 --> 59:08.586
It's not my fault. This guy
came for his sister.

59:09.833 --> 59:12.137
Yeah, I got him right here.

59:13.642 --> 59:15.562
I'll be there soon

59:19.369 --> 59:21.097
Let's go for a ride
you Mother...

59:28.681 --> 59:30.505
Where's Juan?

01:01:11.979 --> 01:01:13.866
Run!

01:01:17.161 --> 01:01:19.337
Zoe! I'll find you!

01:01:20.105 --> 01:01:21.993
I'll find you!

01:01:22.025 --> 01:01:23.945
Zoe!

01:02:14.889 --> 01:02:17.130
I'm talking to you amigo.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:19.721
Did you run
with one of my girls?

01:02:21.802 --> 01:02:24.682
She's not your girl.
She's my sister.

01:02:25.738 --> 01:02:28.073
You know what I hate more than
anything?

01:02:28.361 --> 01:02:30.249
Thieves.

01:02:30.281 --> 01:02:34.602
In Mexico there are many ways
to punish a thief.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:38.569
Tonight I will teach you a few.

01:02:41.066 --> 01:02:42.729
Who are you?

01:02:44.457 --> 01:02:46.409
El diablo.

01:02:51.113 --> 01:02:53.033
String him up.

01:04:12.266 --> 01:04:13.993
Here. Hold still.

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:16.298
What is that?

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:18.761
It's heroine. It's ok. It's
clean.

01:04:18.794 --> 01:04:20.138
Get off me!

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.185
You need to be quiet.

01:04:22.217 --> 01:04:25.002
You're gonna be begging for some
of this in a couple of days.

01:04:25.866 --> 01:04:27.786
Look just do what they say.

01:04:28.201 --> 01:04:31.722
Pretend to like it and maybe
you won't get beat up.

01:04:31.754 --> 01:04:33.674
I promise it gets better.

01:04:37.066 --> 01:04:39.561
By the way,
next guy in is for you.

01:05:00.234 --> 01:05:03.817
Lord have mercy Michael. Pert
near gave me a heart attack.

01:05:04.489 --> 01:05:07.305
I didn't know who else to talk
to.

01:05:07.818 --> 01:05:09.321
About what?

01:05:09.481 --> 01:05:12.841
Something bad happened.
Something really bad happened and I...

01:05:13.738 --> 01:05:16.490
I'm scared to go to the police
because I'm sort of involved with it.

01:05:16.522 --> 01:05:19.177
Pastor can you help me? Can you
help me pastor?

01:05:19.209 --> 01:05:21.418
Hang on now. Whoa whoa. Slow
down ok.

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:24.330
There's nothing we can't get
figured out now ok?

01:05:24.361 --> 01:05:26.281
Here look.

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:33.130
I know her. Is that...

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.954
It's Zoe Stevens.

01:05:34.986 --> 01:05:36.906
Her brother and I were helping
look for her.

01:05:37.546 --> 01:05:38.890
When was this?

01:05:38.922 --> 01:05:41.674
It was yesterday. I'm sorry.

01:05:41.706 --> 01:05:43.626
What happened?

01:05:45.993 --> 01:05:49.002
Willy, Lilly Jethro and George.
That's old school.

01:05:49.034 --> 01:05:52.681
We used to watch those boys when we
were kids down at the Cotton Bowl.

01:05:52.713 --> 01:05:55.146
Wound up with splinters in our
butts.

01:05:55.593 --> 01:05:56.810
Hey Sheriff?

01:05:56.842 --> 01:05:57.930
Yes Ma'am

01:05:57.961 --> 01:05:59.369
You've got a phone call

01:05:59.401 --> 01:06:02.121
Just tell em I'm busy right now.
I'm gone for the day. Give em that one.

01:06:02.152 --> 01:06:04.426
No sir. You're gonna want to
take this one.

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:09.929
Sheriff McNeal speaking.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.354
Sheriff there's a girl here in
town, Zoe Stevens...

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:17.290
she's been kidnapped and I've got the
video evidence right here in my hand.

01:06:17.898 --> 01:06:19.818
What did you
say her name was?

01:06:20.425 --> 01:06:23.305
Stevens. Zoe Stevens.

01:06:24.136 --> 01:06:26.056
And her brother, Ryan's, out
looking for her.

01:06:27.434 --> 01:06:29.738
Get down here right now for a
statement.

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:31.690
Ok.

01:06:34.154 --> 01:06:38.185
Get me the FBI. Get the Captain
of the SWAT team right now.

01:06:38.218 --> 01:06:40.138
Done.

01:06:47.946 --> 01:06:49.834
You want some?

01:06:58.345 --> 01:07:01.066
So let me get this straight.

01:07:01.194 --> 01:07:05.226
You killed my friends and now you
want me to let your sister go.

01:07:05.258 --> 01:07:07.178
Is that right?

01:07:07.305 --> 01:07:09.609
She's just a kid.

01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:13.449
Yeah, that's kind of what we're
going for here.

01:07:14.121 --> 01:07:16.041
And damn is she sexy.

01:07:16.841 --> 01:07:18.856
I'll kill you!

01:07:18.889 --> 01:07:20.809
Good luck with that.

01:07:31.432 --> 01:07:33.225
Having fun yet?

01:07:34.442 --> 01:07:36.393
I'll give you whatever you want.

01:07:42.634 --> 01:07:44.618
Think I need your money?

01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:49.290
Tell me gringo, why would I
sell her to you?

01:07:50.122 --> 01:07:52.809
When I can keep her and sell
her 25 times a night?

01:08:23.913 --> 01:08:26.890
Hey, hey, it's ok.

01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:29.001
I'm gonna find us a way out of
here. Ok?

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:30.218
What's your name?

01:08:30.249 --> 01:08:31.849
Gigi.

01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:34.122
Gigi? That's a really pretty
name.

01:08:34.154 --> 01:08:35.912
How old are you Gigi?

01:08:36.009 --> 01:08:37.705
Eight.

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:41.898
Ok. Ok, listen Gigi.

01:08:41.929 --> 01:08:45.352
I need you to come with me and
be really quiet ok?

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:48.714
Can you do that? Ok let's go.

01:08:52.745 --> 01:08:55.113
So should we keep going or
should I just kill you now?

01:08:55.145 --> 01:08:57.066
I got all day. It's up to you.

01:08:59.912 --> 01:09:01.737
Please.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.689
I just want to see her.

01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:05.609
Well that's too bad.

01:09:05.801 --> 01:09:08.265
Wait, he wants to see her.

01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:10.281
So what?

01:09:10.377 --> 01:09:13.770
I'm gonna show her to you like
you've never seen her before.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.136
Bring her to me.

01:09:22.058 --> 01:09:23.881
I'm scared.

01:09:25.129 --> 01:09:27.591
Ok. I know you are but we have
to go right now.

01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:31.432
Will you sing to me?

01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:34.216
I'm sorry sweety but we have to
go right now.

01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:37.322
My mommy always sings to me
when I'm scared.

01:09:39.273 --> 01:09:41.482
Ok. Ok. Um.

Alpha team contact

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:34.025
Just stay right here
and don't move. Ok?

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:42.601
That's two confirmed
casualties sir.

01:11:43.402 --> 01:11:45.385
Where the hell is Bravo team?

01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:48.810
Getting into position now sir.

01:11:49.321 --> 01:11:52.938
Bravo team, this is your eye in the sky.
Be advised, Our intel was incorrect.

01:11:52.969 --> 01:11:57.738
I repeat, incorrect. There are a lot more hostiles
and civilians inside than we had anticipated.

01:11:59.466 --> 01:12:02.442
When you're ready proceed with
extreme caution.

01:12:04.393 --> 01:12:06.601
Stay tight. Let's go.

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:13.289
Assemble a Charlie team now and
get them over there.

01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:15.209
Roger that.

01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:48.010
What the hell is going on?

01:12:59.049 --> 01:13:01.577
Get the hell out of there!
Pull back now!

01:14:01.995 --> 01:14:05.482
Please help me! Please you have
to get us out!

01:14:18.826 --> 01:14:21.195
I'm sorry I can't!

01:14:48.873 --> 01:14:50.793
Policia!

01:15:02.475 --> 01:15:04.553
Oh my God. Ryan?

01:15:05.194 --> 01:15:07.081
Zoe!

01:15:13.577 --> 01:15:15.977
Just get the rope! Get the rope!

01:15:24.329 --> 01:15:26.761
Come on! Come on pull it!

01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:41.130
Zoe listen. Listen to me. I
just want you to run. Just run!

01:15:41.161 --> 01:15:43.177
Ok, I'm just gonna
get you down first.

01:15:43.209 --> 01:15:44.715
No, you have
to go right now.

01:15:44.745 --> 01:15:46.026
No I can do it. I can get
you down.

01:15:46.057 --> 01:15:47.689
Zoe I want you to go!

01:15:47.721 --> 01:15:48.873
No I'm not leaving you Ryan!

01:15:48.906 --> 01:15:50.089
You have to.

01:15:50.122 --> 01:15:51.145
No.......

01:15:51.178 --> 01:15:52.809
You have to! Come on! Go Zoe!
Go!

01:15:52.841 --> 01:15:55.689
No, Ryan, I can't do that.
Please don't make me do that.

01:15:55.721 --> 01:15:59.593
It's ok. Come here. Come here.
Hurry.

01:16:00.137 --> 01:16:05.353
Come here, Zoe. Listen to me.
I'm gonna be ok.

01:16:05.706 --> 01:16:09.833
Ok? I want you to run and not
look back.

01:16:13.033 --> 01:16:14.889
I love you sis.

01:16:16.009 --> 01:16:17.866
I love you too.

01:16:44.234 --> 01:16:46.441
Hey, are you with me?

01:16:46.473 --> 01:16:49.481
Hang in there son, help is on
the way. Medic!

01:17:03.306 --> 01:17:05.610
Don't move, you'll be ok.

01:17:13.577 --> 01:17:16.650
Charlie team has completely
neutralized the south end.

01:17:17.513 --> 01:17:21.353
Delta team is clearing the west side now.
Two more teams are on the way.

01:17:28.299 --> 01:17:29.962
Come with me.

01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:31.657
No. Please we have to help my
brother. Please.

01:17:37.513 --> 01:17:40.937
Sir, I have an unidentified male
heading for a helicopter

01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:42.506
on the northeast corner
of the compound.

01:17:42.602 --> 01:17:44.809
Can you zoom in and get facial
recognition?

01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:46.186
On it.

01:17:50.186 --> 01:17:51.977
That's him! He's the one!

01:17:52.202 --> 01:17:54.282
Hands! Hands!

01:17:55.274 --> 01:17:57.194
Let me see the hands!

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:09.129
I've got a positive ID match
Juan Fernandez.

01:18:09.450 --> 01:18:11.945
The Juan Fernandez?
Are you sure?

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:14.218
100 percent sir.

01:18:14.314 --> 01:18:16.394
Rotors are warming up now.

01:18:16.489 --> 01:18:17.769
Take him out.

01:18:17.897 --> 01:18:20.329
Sir we don't have any sharp
shooters on that corner.

01:18:20.361 --> 01:18:22.569
Then get someone over there now.

01:18:22.601 --> 01:18:24.010
Sniper team, do you copy?

01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:29.417
Head to the NorthEast corner immediately.
Get eyes on a white helicopter.

01:18:29.449 --> 01:18:31.369
Hands! Hands!

01:19:51.529 --> 01:19:53.930
It's taken off sir.

01:19:55.369 --> 01:19:58.569
Once he clears those power lines he's
going to be out of range quickly.

01:19:58.601 --> 01:20:00.105
Come on!

01:20:00.137 --> 01:20:02.313
Sniper team move! Move!

01:20:11.049 --> 01:20:12.426
Zoe!

01:20:28.265 --> 01:20:30.057
Snipers on the move.

01:20:30.442 --> 01:20:32.362
We've got ten seconds sir.

01:20:35.849 --> 01:20:40.713
5, 4, 3, 2...

01:20:40.874 --> 01:20:42.250
Sniper ready!

01:20:42.282 --> 01:20:44.202
Take the shot.

01:21:06.218 --> 01:21:09.194
Sir, the compound is completely
neutralized.

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:14.826
Wait. I have movement in the
adjacent woods.

01:21:35.337 --> 01:21:39.337
Angel. Where'd you go?

01:21:41.032 --> 01:21:45.801
Ya know I was just starting to like you.
We're a lot alike you and I.

01:21:46.122 --> 01:21:50.026
We're both strong willed.

01:21:52.234 --> 01:21:54.665
We could do good things
together.

01:21:56.297 --> 01:22:01.034
Cash, she ah, she's to rough
around the edges.

01:22:01.578 --> 01:22:05.386
But you, damn, you're my kind
of girl.

01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:28.426
Ryan!

01:22:55.912 --> 01:22:57.769
Get up!

01:23:40.394 --> 01:23:42.282
Stay back.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:35.594
Ryan!

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.449
It's over.

01:24:47.498 --> 01:24:49.418
Zoe.

01:24:50.665 --> 01:24:54.122
Ryan? Ryan!

01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:14.538
Hey, it's ok. Stay with me.

01:25:14.569 --> 01:25:16.650
Ryan... no no no.

01:25:16.681 --> 01:25:18.601
Ryan please.

01:25:18.698 --> 01:25:22.026
Open your eyes, open your eyes
Ryan, your ok.....

01:25:22.058 --> 01:25:23.752
Somebody help us!

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.258
Please!

01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:28.394
Ryan wake up! Ryan!

01:25:28.425 --> 01:25:30.090
Please, somebody help us!

01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:32.010
Please, somebody help us!

01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:33.930
Ryan......

01:25:33.961 --> 01:25:35.529
Wake up!

01:25:35.562 --> 01:25:40.714
Ryan wake up! I can't, I can't
do this without you.

01:26:13.929 --> 01:26:15.818
Hey.

01:26:23.241 --> 01:26:26.056
I thought I might find you here.

01:26:38.601 --> 01:26:40.425
I just miss him so much.

01:26:40.456 --> 01:26:42.376
Yeah I know.

01:26:44.361 --> 01:26:46.602
Ryan, I can't help but think
that...

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:49.322
if I had just listened to you
we wouldn't be here right now.

01:26:49.353 --> 01:26:50.761
We wouldn't be standing here...

01:26:50.794 --> 01:26:54.186
Zoe stop. Look at me. Look at
me.

01:26:56.458 --> 01:26:58.314
It's ok.

01:26:58.953 --> 01:27:00.810
Hear me?

01:27:03.465 --> 01:27:07.753
Look, um, just go hop in the
truck and give me a minute. Ok?

01:27:19.658 --> 01:27:21.514
Wassup Buddy?

01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:26.441
Hey, so Randall finally noticed
that you stopped coming to work.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.394
He told me to tell you that
you're fired, alright?

01:27:31.081 --> 01:27:32.969
It's alright. He fired me too.

01:27:49.481 --> 01:27:51.561
Thank you Kooter...

01:27:53.194 --> 01:27:55.114
for everything.

01:27:56.969 --> 01:28:00.010
You're a good friend buddy.

01:28:21.802 --> 01:28:23.658
Ryan.

01:28:25.001 --> 01:28:27.498
Was it all worth it?

01:28:34.282 --> 01:28:37.162
You're worth it.

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:56.486
