00:07.674 --> 00:09.425
Man, I sure miss Julie.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.427
Spanish midgets.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.763
Spanish midgets wrestling...

00:15.890 --> 00:18.517
Julie.
Okay, yes, I see how you got there.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.484
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.653
No, see, I'm trying this screening thing.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.532
I figure if I always answer the phone,
people will think I don't have a life.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.035
My God.
Rodrigo never gets pinned.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.912
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.956
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.332
This is Jade.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.753
I don't know if you're still at this number,
but I was just thinking about us...

00:45.920 --> 00:50.049
...and how great it was, and, well,
I know it's been three years...

00:50.300 --> 00:52.676
...but I was kind of hoping
we could hook up again.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.888
You know, I barely had the nerve
to make this call...

00:56.139 --> 00:58.307
...so you know what I did?
- What?

00:58.516 --> 01:00.517
I got a little drunk...

01:00.685 --> 01:01.727
...and naked.

01:01.936 --> 01:03.228
Bob here.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.738
So, uh, what have you been up to?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.615
Oh, you know, the usual.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.158
Teaching aerobics...

01:59.077 --> 02:01.203
...partying way too much. Heh.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.288
Oh, and in case you were wondering...

02:03.540 --> 02:07.459
...those are my legs
on the new James Bond poster.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.881
Can you hold on a moment?
I have another call.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.758
- I love her.
- I know.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.138
- I'm back.
- So are we gonna get together?

02:19.347 --> 02:20.764
Uh, absolutely.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.641
Uh, how about tomorrow afternoon?

02:22.851 --> 02:25.561
Do you know, uh, Central Perk
in the village? Say, five-ish?

02:25.770 --> 02:28.647
- Great. I'll see you then.
- Okay.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.775
Okay.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.528
Having a phone has finally paid off.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.116
Even though you do
do a good Bob impression...

02:39.325 --> 02:41.118
...I'm thinking when
she sees you tomorrow...

02:41.286 --> 02:43.620
...she's probably gonna realize, hey,
you're not Bob.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.207
I am hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

02:47.375 --> 02:52.337
...she will seek comfort in the open arms
of the wry stranger at the next table.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.299
Oh, my God. You are pure evil.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.177
Okay, pure evil...

02:59.053 --> 03:00.637
...horny and alone.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.058
I've done this.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.358
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.820
Hey, everybody.
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.030
Hi, Julie.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.781
Hi, Julie.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.243
Okay. While Ross is on the phone...

03:23.411 --> 03:25.412
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.292
Um, is there any chance
that you're rounding up from...

03:32.170 --> 03:34.838
...you know, from like 20?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.800
Hey, come on, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.719
Do we need a cake?

03:42.388 --> 03:43.847
Look, I know it's a little steep.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.515
Whoosh.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.602
But it's Ross.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.231
- Yeah, it's Ross.
- Yeah, you're right.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.691
All right? Okay. I'll see you later.
I gotta go...

03:54.943 --> 03:56.568
...do a thing.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.780
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later tonight.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.908
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you're not
really going through with this, are you?

04:03.284 --> 04:05.535
You know, I think I might just.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.707
So, uh, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

04:12.001 --> 04:14.962
Well, I guess I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.839
So I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.468
Can you believe how much
this is gonna cost?

04:22.011 --> 04:24.930
Do you guys ever get the feeling
that, um...

04:25.181 --> 04:26.556
...Chandler and those guys...

04:27.141 --> 04:29.935
...just don't get that we don't make
as much money as they do?

04:30.144 --> 04:31.311
- Yes.
- Really?

04:31.479 --> 04:34.314
It's like they're always saying,
"Let's go here, let's go there."

04:34.524 --> 04:37.734
- Like we can afford to go here and there.
- Yeah.

04:37.902 --> 04:42.114
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice, you know?

04:42.282 --> 04:47.160
It's not like we can say anything about it,
because, like, this is a birthday thing...

04:47.370 --> 04:48.745
...you know, and it's for Ross.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.414
- For Ross.
- For Ross.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.293
Oh, my God.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.627
- Hi.
- What?

04:55.837 --> 04:57.629
Okay. I'm at work...

04:57.797 --> 05:01.008
...just an ordinary day, you know,
chop, chop, sautÃ©, sautÃ©.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.970
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.181
Turns out they fired the head lunch chef,
and guess who got the job.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.184
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.730
- Fortunately, it is me.
- Oh.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.357
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you very much.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.192
That's so cool.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.612
Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross.
We should go out and celebrate.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.864
You know, someplace nice.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.872
- Someplace nice.
- Yeah.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.833
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.300
I'm telling you, you can't do this.

05:43.468 --> 05:47.512
Oh, come on, I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.805
That doesn't matter.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.349
She wanted to call Bob.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.894
Hey, for all we know,
Bob is who she was meant to be with.

05:54.103 --> 05:57.022
You may be destroying
two people's chance for happiness.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.732
We don't know Bob.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.153
Okay? We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.491
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.659
All right.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.162
Go.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.255
Hi.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.092
Listen, I have to, uh, ahem...

06:25.259 --> 06:27.219
I have to confess something.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.513
Yes?

06:31.307 --> 06:33.725
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.770
- How did you...
- I don't know.

06:38.940 --> 06:43.193
I just had this weird sense. You know?
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.364
Tissue?

06:48.366 --> 06:49.408
Thanks.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.744
No, no, you keep the pack.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.080
I'm all cried out today.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.011
Okay, okay.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.391
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.560
Who is also in charge of purchasing.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.688
Newly appointed head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing...

07:19.939 --> 07:23.191
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

07:23.901 --> 07:27.821
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing,
own little desk when Roland's not there...

07:28.030 --> 07:31.116
...here's to my little sister...
- Oh, wait. And I got a beeper.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.534
Oh, cool.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.247
- That's fine, I'll just wait.
- Aw, sorry.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.040
Oh, sorry, sorry.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.750
Monica.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.172
Are we ready to order?

07:45.381 --> 07:47.007
Oh. You know,
we haven't even looked yet.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.884
Well, when you do, just let me know.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.011
I'll be right over there
on the edge of my seat.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.935
Wow, look at these prices.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.771
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."

08:02.899 --> 08:05.775
I know. What are these,
famous chickens?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.738
- Sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.
- Thanks.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.074
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible
was my afternoon with Jade?

08:13.242 --> 08:17.662
Well, pretty incredible, according to
the message she left on my machine.

08:18.414 --> 08:22.626
Hey, Chandler, why is this woman
leaving a message for you on my machine?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.961
See, I had to tell her
that my number was your number.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.922
I couldn't tell her
my number was my number...

08:27.089 --> 08:30.133
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

08:31.427 --> 08:34.929
Hey, tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

08:36.557 --> 08:37.724
Do I dare ask?

08:37.933 --> 08:41.352
Yes, I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then I'll have the grilled prawns.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.895
That sounds great, same for me.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.940
And for the gentleman?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.775
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.111
But, hey, look, if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

08:50.321 --> 08:52.239
...is it cheaper?

08:52.490 --> 08:54.741
You'd think, wouldn't you?

08:55.284 --> 08:57.077
- Miss?
- Okay.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.745
I will have the, uh...

08:58.913 --> 09:00.205
...side salad.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.083
And what would that be on the side of?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.043
I don't know.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.255
Why don't you just put it right here
next to my water?

09:10.967 --> 09:12.050
And for you?

09:12.343 --> 09:16.846
Um, I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup...

09:17.014 --> 09:19.683
...and, um...

09:20.434 --> 09:21.851
...take care.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.899
- I will have the, uh, Cajun catfish.
- Anything else?

09:28.150 --> 09:30.068
Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.615
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

09:41.330 --> 09:43.999
Plus tip, divided by six...

09:45.126 --> 09:47.210
Okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.255
Um, everyone?

09:51.048 --> 09:53.258
Oh. You're right, I'm sorry.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.467
Thank you.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.344
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.597
Aw, thank you.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.473
So five of us is...

10:01.517 --> 10:03.226
...33.50 apiece.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.895
No. Uh-uh. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.982
Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.

10:11.193 --> 10:13.987
Sorry, Monica.
I'm really happy you got promoted...

10:14.196 --> 10:17.407
...but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

10:17.575 --> 10:18.617
No.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.537
Rachel just had that little salad...

10:22.747 --> 10:26.082
...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.209
Okay, Pheebs.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.504
How about we'll each
just pay for what we had, okay?

10:31.714 --> 10:34.132
- It's no big deal.
- Not for you.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.180
All right, what's going on?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.516
Okay, look, I really don't wanna
get into this right now.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.895
- It'll just make everybody uncomfortable.
- Oh, fine. All right, fine.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.230
- What? Whoa, whoa.
- You can tell us.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.275
Yeah, hello? It's us.
All right? We'll be fine.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.281
Ahem. Okay, um...

10:59.575 --> 11:03.328
Uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem...

11:03.496 --> 11:08.208
...sometimes you guys don't get that,
uh, ahem...

11:14.548 --> 11:16.966
We don't have as much money as you.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.181
- Okay.
- I hear you.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.934
We can talk about that.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.228
Well, then...

11:29.980 --> 11:31.147
...let's.

11:32.733 --> 11:38.196
Well, um, I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.573
- That's because you have it.
- That's a good point.

11:42.910 --> 11:46.663
So, um, how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

11:46.872 --> 11:50.041
Because it's always something, you know?
Like with Monica's new job...

11:50.209 --> 11:53.086
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.213
What? Whoa, hey.

11:55.381 --> 11:59.926
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative...

12:00.136 --> 12:02.011
There's gonna be a hoopla?

12:04.598 --> 12:09.102
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing and it's...

12:09.895 --> 12:12.814
If it makes anybody feel better,
we can just forget the thing...

12:13.023 --> 12:15.066
...and we'll just do the gift.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.902
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.906
No, the thing was we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.869
Hootie and the... Oh, my...
I can catch them on the radio.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.039
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.667
No, look, hey, it's my birthday...

12:32.877 --> 12:36.045
...and the important thing
is that we all be together.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.422
- All of us.
- Together.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.215
Not at the concert.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.219
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thanks.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.637
Yeah.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.938
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

12:58.694 --> 13:00.570
Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.323
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.450
Oh, it's like a skit.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.871
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

13:10.080 --> 13:12.415
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

13:14.543 --> 13:18.421
We switched meat suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

13:18.631 --> 13:22.842
But wait, there's more.
Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.930
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.348
Come on.

13:29.099 --> 13:32.018
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.648
The Blowfish.

13:38.567 --> 13:42.278
It's on us, all right? So don't worry.
This is our treat.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.031
So... thank you.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.869
Could you be less enthused?

13:50.079 --> 13:52.497
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.499
But it just feels like...

13:54.959 --> 13:56.000
Like?

13:56.794 --> 13:58.962
- Charity.
- Charity?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.548
We're just trying to do a nice thing here.

14:01.757 --> 14:05.844
But, Ross, you have to understand, your
nice thing makes us feel about this big.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.013
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

14:10.182 --> 14:14.811
What? I don't understand. I mean,
it's like we can't win with you guys.

14:15.062 --> 14:18.147
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.233
Maybe that's just how you feel.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.402
Oh.

14:23.153 --> 14:28.074
- Now you're telling us how we feel.
- We never should have talked about this.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.993
I'm gonna pass on the concert...

14:30.160 --> 14:33.538
...because I'm just not in a very
Hootie place right now.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.376
- Me neither.
- Me too.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.837
Guys, we bought the tickets.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.591
Well, then you'll have extra seats,
you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.386
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

14:52.516 --> 14:54.350
So I guess now we can't go.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.897
Come on, do what you want. Do we
always have to do everything together?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.900
You know what? You're right.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.737
- Fine.
- Fine.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.406
- Fine.
- All right.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.075
We're gonna go.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.083
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.551
- Chandler?
- Yeah.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.345
Oh, jeez.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.305
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.016
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.768
Whoa, whoa.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.063
What? You had sex today?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.608
Wow. It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it.

15:45.110 --> 15:49.280
I was awesome, okay? She was
biting her lip to stop from screaming.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.657
Wow.

15:50.824 --> 15:54.243
Now, I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.084
Still doing the screening thing?

16:01.543 --> 16:03.211
I had sex today.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.547
I never have to answer that phone again.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.926
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.136
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.598
I just wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn't show up the other day.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.686
And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.

16:20.938 --> 16:21.980
Bob here.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.940
Oh, hi.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.401
So, uh, you met someone, huh?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.069
Yes. Yes, I did.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.823
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.203
So, uh, how was he?

16:37.579 --> 16:38.913
Eh...

16:46.088 --> 16:47.171
"Eh"?

16:47.631 --> 16:50.967
Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.223
I had to bite my lip to keep
from screaming your name.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.437
Well, that makes me feel so good.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.897
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.650
Bumpy?

17:07.818 --> 17:12.155
Maybe he had some kind of, uh,
new cool style that you're not familiar with.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.574
And, uh,
maybe you have to get used to it.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.909
There wasn't much time to get used to it...

17:17.077 --> 17:18.243
...if you know what I mean.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.091
You know what?
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.595
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.805
So let's go.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.689
Well, you know,
maybe we should stay for one song.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.776
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.986
You know, the guys are probably
having a great time.

17:52.154 --> 17:56.157
Every time I look at you
I go blind

17:56.325 --> 17:58.367
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.702
Okay.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.622
- One.
- No.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.754
Thank you very much.
We are Hootie & The Blowfish.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.549
- That was amazing.
- Excellent.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.468
I can't believe the guys missed this.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.595
What guys? Oh, yeah.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.933
Excuse me.
You're Monica Geller, aren't you?

18:22.392 --> 18:24.769
- Do I know you?
- You used to be my baby-sitter.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.939
Oh, my God. Little Stevie Fisher?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.649
How have you been?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.567
Good, good. I'm a lawyer now.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.070
You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.406
Well, listen, it was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.741
Wait, backstage?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.576
Oh, yeah. My firm represents the band.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.286
- Ross.
- Chandler.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.791
- Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
- Yeah, we do.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.000
Come on.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.504
So, look, are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my dad?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.970
- Hey, you guys.
- Happy birthday.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.888
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.224
So, uh...

19:04.017 --> 19:06.102
How was your night last night?

19:06.395 --> 19:09.856
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.774
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.485
Oh, but I did run into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

19:14.695 --> 19:16.779
Oh, yeah. I used to baby-sit him.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.531
Hey, how's his dad?

19:20.784 --> 19:21.993
Good.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.621
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening
was pretty much a bust.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.708
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

19:28.917 --> 19:32.712
Yeah, look, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

19:32.921 --> 19:38.009
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like...

19:38.427 --> 19:39.468
Is that a hickey?

19:41.763 --> 19:43.431
Oh, ha, ha, no, I just...

19:43.640 --> 19:45.391
I fell down.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.478
On someone's lips?

19:50.772 --> 19:52.440
Where'd you get the hickey?

19:52.649 --> 19:55.026
- You know, a party or...
- What party?

19:55.235 --> 19:59.822
Well, it wasn't a party so much as a...
A gathering of people.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.492
With food and music and...

20:03.744 --> 20:05.328
And the band.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.915
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

20:09.166 --> 20:13.044
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.588
Who gave you that hickey?

20:15.839 --> 20:17.423
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.096
I can't believe it. I can't believe this.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.851
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

20:31.438 --> 20:34.106
...and you guys are out, like,
partying and having fun and all:

20:34.316 --> 20:36.442
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck."

20:40.113 --> 20:42.657
Hey, look, don't blame us.
You guys could've been there.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.993
Oh, what? As part of your
Poor Friends Outreach program?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.038
Oh, great. It's work.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.917
Look, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry that we make more than you.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.254
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it.
We work really hard for it.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.130
And we don't work hard?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.966
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I got a page.

21:00.175 --> 21:04.178
I'm just saying that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.472
- Oh, and you feel like we hold you back.
- Yes.

21:07.557 --> 21:08.641
No.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.563
Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.607
Wait, I don't understand.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.985
Those steaks were just a gift
from the meat vendor.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.945
That was not a kickback.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.782
Come on, I'll just replace them
and we can forget the whole thing.

21:27.786 --> 21:28.995
What corporate policy?

21:34.918 --> 21:36.043
Yeah.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.753
Okay.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.468
I just got fired.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.977
Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.437
Let me get that.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.442
You got 5 bucks?

22:10.078 --> 22:12.496
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.624
Hi, it's me.

22:18.795 --> 22:21.297
Listen, Bob,
I'm probably way out of line here.

22:21.465 --> 22:25.885
I mean, it has been three years, and you're
probably seeing someone else now...

22:26.136 --> 22:29.972
...but if we could just have one night
together, just for old time's sake...

22:30.182 --> 22:34.602
One hot, steamy, wild night...
