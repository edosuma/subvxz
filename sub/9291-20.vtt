00:14.280 --> 00:17.960
- I want Bauer arrested.
- Bauer is heading the field operation.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.000
Bauer is not the only man who can do the job!
Put someone else in charge!

00:21.080 --> 00:25.360
Jack, we got a problem.
Secret Service is on their way to arrest you.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.120
We can't interrupt this mission.
You gotta stall 'em.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.840
Nothing I can do.
Get Marwan before Secret Service gets there.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.880
People of America,
you wake up today to a different world.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.640
" I have a visual on Marwan.
He is in the building.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.440
- They know we're here. Move on the building.
- Our cover's blown. Everyone, go, go, go, go!

00:44.520 --> 00:46.840
Bomb!

00:49.160 --> 00:54.720
President Logan realised this was a mistake.
You're free to go.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.760
We had Marwan.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.280
Dammit, we had him!

00:58.760 --> 01:02.480
This man, Marwan, has a nuclear warhead
and I allowed him to escape.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.120
- Mr President...
- Stop.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.800
I don't even know
if I deserve to be called that.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.080
There's someone who can
advise you better than I can.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.680
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.440
President Logan is requesting you run
the effort to recover the stolen weapon

01:17.520 --> 01:20.600
and be in place to make
whatever decisions need to be made.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.360
- Is it compatible?
- I'll need to reconfigure the trigger.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.120
- Has the warhead been reconfigured?
- " Yes."

01:27.200 --> 01:30.880
- We may have a potential security breach.
- Who?

01:30.960 --> 01:34.720
The technician, Sabir.
His girlfriend's getting suspicious.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.160
I think Sabir may have
become involved with radical groups.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.880
- You mean terrorists?
- Yes.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.720
The woman who was suspicious
about her boyfriend panned out.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.080
She sent us a schematic of a microchip. It's
used exclusively in legacy nuclear warheads.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.720
Take a team with you. Let's go.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.720
What was that?

01:53.040 --> 01:55.840
He's gonna ram us!

02:23.960 --> 02:26.880
- Good to have you back, Mr President.
- Than you, Aaron.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.360
- This way, sir.
- President Logan's not in the West Wing?

02:30.440 --> 02:35.520
No, sir. Since the strike on Air Force One,
he's been in the bunker.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.480
- How's your son?
- Very well, sir. Thank you for asking.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.640
- Still in the service?
- Yes. In fact, he just re-upped.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.040
- Good for him.
- I'm mighty proud.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.280
Mr President. Thank you for coming.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.120
- Is there an update on President Keeler?
- No, he's still comatose.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.040
- The long-term prognosis is still unclear?
- Yes.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.080
- How's President Logan?
- Looking forward to seeing you.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.160
Thank you, Eric.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.000
President Logan.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.440
David. I appreciate your coming so quickly.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.480
Tell me how I can help you.

03:23.560 --> 03:29.080
David, I wasn't prepared to have
all of this thrust upon me so suddenly.

03:29.160 --> 03:34.000
What I'm trying to say is, I made mistakes.
This crisis could have ended an hour ago

03:34.080 --> 03:39.000
if I hadn't interfered with the CTU operation
that would have captured Habib Marwan.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.080
Punishing yourself
is something you can't afford now.

03:42.160 --> 03:46.200
What I can't afford and what this country
can't afford is another mistake.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.160
Every decision I make
affects millions of Americans.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.080
- I understand the pressure you're under.
- I know you do.

03:52.160 --> 03:58.280
In office, you dealt with this kind of situation
more than once. That's why I want you here.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.480
I still don't understand
what it is I can do to help you.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.560
Sit.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.160
The warhead that was stolen is an S-series.

04:09.240 --> 04:13.560
That's one of the most powerful
nuclear weapons in the arsenal.

04:13.640 --> 04:19.560
Wherever it's detonated,
it will wreak unthinkable devastation.

04:24.520 --> 04:28.720
Help me find it. I'll give you
full authority to act as my proxy

04:28.800 --> 04:31.800
whenever you think it's necessary.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.800
Charles, how do you want this to work?

04:35.880 --> 04:43.560
I'll call Bill Buchanan at CTU, and I'll let him
know that he'll be dealing directly with you.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.800
All right.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.640
Thank you, David.
Mike will fill you in.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.000
We will get through this, Mr President.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.600
Um, I'll be, uh, in conference room B,

05:02.680 --> 05:05.160
working on the
morning statement for the press.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.280
I'll keep you apprised
of any developments, sir.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.040
Thank you, Mike.

05:19.200 --> 05:25.000
Mr President. I know you believe
my actions during your term in office

05:25.080 --> 05:29.160
amounted to a personal and political betrayal.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.240
That's not something I believe.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.600
It's a fact. Get to your point.

05:33.680 --> 05:39.680
If my presence here makes it more difficult
for you, say the word and I'll leave.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.560
Mike, you're wired into this administration.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.760
And I have no doubt that you have
this country's best interests at heart.

05:51.840 --> 05:56.440
So for now, let's let bygones be bygones
and get to work.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.080
Thank you, Mr President. I appreciate that.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.280
I reviewed the briefing on the way here.

06:04.360 --> 06:09.440
Have army reserves supplement the search
teams looking for the warhead in lowa.

06:09.520 --> 06:13.080
And have DOE and DOD
coordinating on crisis response

06:13.160 --> 06:15.000
- in case it's detonated.
- Yes, sir.

06:15.080 --> 06:19.400
CTU is heading up the search for this man
who stole the warhead, Habib Marwan?

06:19.480 --> 06:23.600
Yes, they recovered a damaged video tape
from Marwan's last known location.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.560
They're in the process of restoring it.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.320
But Marwan is not
CTU's only lead on the warhead now.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.600
- What else do they have?
- A CTU analyst named Chloe O'Brian

06:33.680 --> 06:37.080
secured a hard drive belonging
to one of Marwan's associates.

06:37.160 --> 06:41.520
This hard drive may contain information
that could lead us to the warhead.

06:45.720 --> 06:50.600
I told you, I'm not hurt. I did the shooting.
Now please leave me alone so I can do this.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.480
The hard drive is unlocked.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.080
It belonged to someone who had
no experience of nuclear weapons.

06:56.160 --> 07:00.560
- He got that information from someone.
- The emails I'm decrypting look like that.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.600
Schematics, designs of triggers,

07:02.680 --> 07:04.480
- all from the same person.
- Who?

07:04.560 --> 07:07.440
The address is shielded
under a false domain name.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.720
- What is it?
- MEM4FT.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.880
- Forward the emails to us. Edgar?
- I'll run a trace to find a point of origin.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.360
These emails came from a domestic server.
Whoever sent this is in this country.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.200
OK, Chloe, thank you. Hold on.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.360
Hey. How are you holding up?

07:24.120 --> 07:28.320
I'm not used to the idea that I just
killed someone, but I'm doing my job.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.800
Fair enough.
Get back as soon as you can, OK?

07:31.880 --> 07:33.280
OK.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.200
I got a hit. The man who sent the emails.
Name is Lee Jong.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.600
- Is he in our database?
- Chinese national.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.600
A researcher at China's
nuclear weapons programme.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.240
He was accused of falsifying
research data and fired in 2001.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.000
Is China providing Marwan
with support for this?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.920
They wouldn't use someone
that could be traced to them.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.560
He's selling his services as a freelancer.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.680
If he's helping Marwan reconfigure
the warhead, he'll know how to find him.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.920
See if Lee entered the country last week.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.080
Excuse me. This is Bauer.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.640
Jack? Dr Besson. You wanted me
to give you an update on Paul Raines.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.360
He's still in recovery, but you can
see him now. Just a few minutes.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.120
Thank you.
Get back to me if you find anything.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.360
- Where can I find you?
- I'll be in Medical.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.960
Hey.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.960
Dr Besson wants to move you
to Amherst General,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.520
but the FAA still has a ban on air travel.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.840
I am trying to get you an exemption.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.080
Well, if anyone can get
an exemption, you can.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.159
Listen.

08:43.240 --> 08:48.280
I've thought a lot about this,
and I want to go with you to Massachusetts.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.920
- With me?
- Yeah.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.760
You need to get better,
and you shouldn't have to do that alone.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.040
I can take care of myself.
I don't need your charity.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.720
It's not about charity,
Paul, it's what I want to do.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.920
What about Jack?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.400
You said you were in love with him.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.240
I know.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.720
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

09:15.800 --> 09:21.160
- I'll come back later.
- " No, it's all right. Come in.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.680
I thought you'd be at the DOD briefing.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.280
- Yeah, it ended early.
- Oh.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.240
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.800
I've been trying to get down here
since you got out of surgery.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.480
- Listen, Paul...
- You don't have to say anything.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.320
Yeah, I do. You saved my life.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.720
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time. That's all.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.440
- You pushed me out of the way.
- Honestly, I wasn't even thinking.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.760
It just happened.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.480
Paul. You all right?

10:02.320 --> 10:04.720
I'll check back on you later.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.600
Does he know that
you want to come with me?

10:15.120 --> 10:17.040
Not yet.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.560
- What is it?
- We found Lee Jong. Chinese consulate.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.240
He must have known we were coming.
He took refuge.

10:23.320 --> 10:27.320
He got there an hour ago. Consulate's
sovereign territory, we can't get him.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.240
But we're gonna try. David Palmer for you.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.800
David Palmer?

10:31.880 --> 10:35.160
Frankly, Logan's been
overwhelmed by what's happening.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.880
- He enlisted Palmer to help us directly.
- Good.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.280
- Bauer.
- " Hold for the president."

10:42.120 --> 10:44.120
- Sir.
- Thank you, Mike.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.960
- It's nice to talk to you again, Jack.
- It's nice to talk to you too.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.080
I assume Bill told you about Lee Jong?

10:51.160 --> 10:52.240
Yes, sir.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.440
I'm about to call the Chinese consul
and explain the situation.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.960
I'd like it if you took Lee into custody
and brought him to CTU for interrogation.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.000
- You think the consul will cooperate?
- He's reasonable.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.440
And if the protocol approach doesn't work?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.960
I'll leave it to you to make the preparations.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.800
Whatever it takes.
We need this man Lee in custody.

11:11.880 --> 11:16.480
- I understand, Mr President.
- "Thank you, Jack."

11:16.560 --> 11:19.040
- You have a Chinese interpreter?
- Melissa Raab.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.960
I need her, Curtis and one of his agents
ready to move on the consulate.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.080
Edgar Stiles.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.520
- " We got a partial."
- I'm opening a window. Send it through.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.600
Ms Dessler.

11:29.680 --> 11:33.840
Division called. That video tape,
they were able to reconstruct part of it.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.520
They're sending it
to my workstation as we speak.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.600
Bill.

11:40.120 --> 11:44.720
People of America,
you wake up today to a different world.

11:44.800 --> 11:49.440
One of your own nuclear weapons
has been used against you.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.480
It'll be days and weeks before you can
measure the damage we have caused,

11:53.560 --> 11:56.240
but as you count your dead...

11:56.320 --> 11:58.400
"Wake up today to a different world."

11:58.480 --> 12:02.200
Do we take that literally?
He'll set off the warhead before dawn?

12:02.280 --> 12:06.520
We have to look at the worst case scenario.
What time is sunrise on the east coast?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.800
7:02. Less than two hours from now.

12:11.840 --> 12:17.040
Unless you renounce your policies of
imperialism and interventionist activities,

12:17.120 --> 12:22.800
this attack will be followed by another,
and another after that.

12:36.120 --> 12:40.600
The Chinese consul in Los Angeles.
A man named Koo Yin.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.200
Mr Koo. This is David Palmer.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.280
It's an honour to speak with you.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.760
I'm calling on behalf of President Logan.

12:48.840 --> 12:53.880
The situation today has forced him to direct
his attention to other equally urgent matters.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.240
I understand.

12:55.320 --> 12:59.760
And my government extends its sympathy
for these terrible attacks on your country.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.040
We stand ready to help in any way we can.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.320
Thank you. The fact is, you can help us.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.320
There's a man in your consulate
by the name of Lee Jong.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.200
Yes.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.160
He arrived here earlier tonight.

13:12.240 --> 13:16.160
We have evidence connecting him
to the terrorists behind today's attacks.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.080
We need to take Mr Lee into custody
immediately for questioning.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.000
Mr Lee expected suspicion to fall on him.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.760
He says he has no connection to terrorists.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.840
We believe he's helping terrorists
detonate a nuclear device on our soil.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.800
Many lives are at stake, Mr Koo.

13:32.880 --> 13:38.200
President Palmer, I would very much like
to help, but Mr Lee is a Chinese citizen,

13:38.280 --> 13:40.520
and the consulate is Chinese territory.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.800
I can't hand him over to you
without going through channels.

13:43.880 --> 13:48.320
Then I urge you to contact the premier
immediately and explain the situation.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.840
Tell him speed is of the essence.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.160
Tell him cooperation will be regarded

13:54.240 --> 13:57.600
as an extraordinary act of friendship
on the part of his nation.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.880
And our nation will respond in kind.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.800
Mr President, I'll do my best.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.560
Thank you, Mr Koo.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.160
Consul's gonna try
to make something happen.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.280
How long will it take?

14:15.360 --> 14:17.720
I don't know.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.880
Anything new?

14:22.960 --> 14:27.040
White House authorised adding lowa army
reserve units to the ground search.

14:27.120 --> 14:31.080
- Have they widened the perimeter?
- 60-mile radius around the area.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.320
But Marwan's people
might have sneaked it outside that.

14:34.400 --> 14:39.240
We closed all major roads and air traffic,
but there is a chance they got it through.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.920
Homeland Security's faxing over
casualty projections based on that.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.200
- That's probably them right now.
- Yeah. I'll get it.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.040
- CTU.
- " I'm calling for Tony. Who's this?"

14:53.120 --> 14:55.640
Michelle Dessler, a colleague. Who's calling?

14:55.720 --> 14:59.920
The woman he happens to be living with.
Is he there?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.800
Yeah. Hold on.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.720
- It's for you.
- Who is it?

15:03.800 --> 15:06.320
The woman you're living with.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.200
Jen.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.280
I've been calling everyone,
going crazy looking for you.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.840
Then I thought maybe
Jack took you back there.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.320
Do you have any idea how worried I've been?

15:20.400 --> 15:23.360
I'm sorry, I should have called,
but I've been busy.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.320
Oh, really busy with Michelle Dessler?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.720
- I'm working, Jen.
- For CTU?

15:29.240 --> 15:31.280
On a provisional basis, yeah.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.040
I thought you hated that place.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.440
Things have changed a little.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.560
Yeah. I guess they have.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.640
We can talk about this later.
Right now I gotta go.

15:41.720 --> 15:46.280
- Tony, what's your ex-wife doing there?
- Jen, I'm sorry, but I gotta go.

15:50.920 --> 15:54.440
Michelle, um... I'm sorry
you had to find out like that.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.560
It's really none of my business.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.880
Yeah, it is. I should have told you
I was living with somebody.

15:59.960 --> 16:05.000
- I don't want to talk about this right now.
- Yeah, well, I do. Listen to me.

16:05.080 --> 16:11.680
When you left, everything fell apart.
Jen happened to be there for me.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.360
You don't have to excuse your relationship.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.480
I'm not making excuses.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.760
I'm just telling you how it is.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.920
Do you love her?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.360
No.

16:33.960 --> 16:38.000
Ms Dessler, new protocols from DOD came in.
Should I send them to your screen?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.080
Send them to station 16.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.640
Thank you, Edgar.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.520
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.280
Is there anything I can do?

17:05.359 --> 17:10.319
I said I'm fine. I'm trying not to think about
what happened. I'm gonna process it later.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.760
Sure, fine.

17:12.839 --> 17:16.480
Edgar, I appreciate your concern, I really do.

17:16.560 --> 17:23.319
It's just that when I shot that guy I thought I'd
go all foetal, but I didn't feel anything at all.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.160
I hope I'm not some kind of a psychopath.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.480
- He was trying to kill you.
- But still...

17:28.560 --> 17:33.440
Maybe it's a delayed reaction kind of thing.
Maybe you'll freak out about it in a few days.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.040
I hope so.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.360
- Anything you come up with...
- Sir.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.920
Sir. Bill Buchanan.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.120
- Thank you.
- All right.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.400
- Yes, Bill.
- "Mr President."

17:44.480 --> 17:46.880
We've seen a tape recorded by Habib Marwan.

17:46.960 --> 17:50.640
On it he says we'll be
"waking up to a different world".

17:50.720 --> 17:57.120
It may indicate that the warhead will be
detonated before dawn on the east coast.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.200
Thank you, Bill.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.480
CTU thinks that the warhead
may be detonated before dawn.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.560
Get me Mr Koo.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.520
- This is Koo Yin.
- " Please hold for President Palmer."

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
We have the consul, sir.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.760
- Mr Koo.
- I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.240
Is the premier aware of the situation?

18:25.320 --> 18:29.240
- Yes, he's considering it very carefully.
- There's no time for that.

18:29.320 --> 18:33.800
I've learned the terrorists may detonate
a nuclear device within the next two hours.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.400
I understand the urgency of the situation.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.640
Without making any promises, I have
every expectation of a favourable answer.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.400
- When?
- I'll speak with him in two to three hours.

18:44.480 --> 18:51.280
- I told you, that's not soon enough.
- I'm sorry, Mr President, it's the best I can do.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.160
Thank you for your efforts.
Please keep me informed.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.560
Of course, Mr President.

19:01.200 --> 19:06.400
He thinks Mr Lee will be handed over to us,
but not before two or three hours.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.960
From their point of view,
that's very fast for something like this.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.240
From ours, not nearly fast enough.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.440
What do we do?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.680
- Bauer.
- Jack, are you at the consulate yet?

19:33.760 --> 19:37.200
Yes, sir. We're across the street.
Have they agreed to release Lee?

19:37.280 --> 19:38.840
Not quickly enough.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.680
And I just learned that the nuclear device
may be set off at any moment.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.720
Now, Jack. Is there any doubt in your mind
that Lee is working with Marwan?

19:46.800 --> 19:49.600
No, sir. The emails he sent
left no room for doubt.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.440
Then we have to get Lee now
and find out what he knows.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.240
Yes, sir.

19:53.320 --> 19:58.920
No one connected with the government can
admit to knowing anything about this. Ever.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.680
If you're caught, you'll be tried
in a Chinese court under Chinese law.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.560
I understand.

20:04.640 --> 20:08.400
Now, Jack, if it was anyone else,
I'd ask if you were sure about this.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.600
With you I already know the answer.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.480
God bless you. Good luck.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.560
Thank you, Mr President.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.240
We're on. We're going in to get him.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
All right.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.360
- Almeida.
- "Tony, this is Jack."

20:28.440 --> 20:31.520
I'm at the consulate.
I need infrared satellite coverage.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.040
I'm on it. What's going on, Jack?

20:34.120 --> 20:38.440
The consul's not gonna release Lee in time.
We have to go in and get him.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.480
- Who knows?
- We've authorisation from the White House.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.720
Tony, this is a covert operation.
You're the only person in CTU who can know.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.000
Spoof the satellite logs and make sure
the mainframes aren't monitoring you.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.920
Tony, there can't be any record.
You understand?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
- "Yeah."
- OK, thanks.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.800
Let's suit up.

21:13.880 --> 21:18.000
- Tony, it's Jack. I'm on comm.
- I'm uploading a picture of Lee to you now.

21:18.080 --> 21:22.320
Also, I just got ahold
of the building schematic.

21:22.400 --> 21:26.160
- You overlay the infrared?
- " Coming now."

21:26.240 --> 21:29.280
The bulk of them are in
the first floor residential area.

21:29.360 --> 21:33.080
- "Most of 'em not moving. Probably asleep."
- Try the second floor offices.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.600
All right. Grabbing data on the second floor.

21:37.600 --> 21:42.000
- All right, we got people moving.
- That third room is probably where Lee is.

21:42.080 --> 21:46.160
- "I think you're right."
- I'll get back to you as soon as I'm moving.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.720
- How do you want to deploy?
- I want Agent Raab to stay in the van.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.800
You cover the perimeter. I go in alone.

21:51.880 --> 21:55.000
- Jack.
- My orders are to make this deniable.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.920
If I get caught, I have to be able
to say I was acting alone.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.120
- All right. What do you want us to do?
- Cover the perimeter.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.960
You can re-engage
as soon as I leave the consulate.

22:05.040 --> 22:09.400
But only on a covert basis. Masks on,
non-lethal force. You understand?

22:09.480 --> 22:11.760
We'll be here.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.920
- "I'm going in. Any change on infrared?"
- Negative.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.960
We'll monitor in real time.

22:53.760 --> 22:58.240
The alarm system's a Cambria model three.
I'm jumping the release of the door now.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.560
Roger that.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.560
All right, Jack, stop.

23:19.640 --> 23:24.240
We have somebody approaching from
your west side, I repeat, your west side.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.720
OK, he's moving away.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.440
Gimme the status on the other guards.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
Jack, you're right on top of 'em.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.960
We have someone approaching
from your north side.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.040
OK, you're clear.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.880
- I got him.
- " Roger that."

24:58.800 --> 25:01.600
People moving towards you on both floors.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.040
Exiting the consulate.
Hostiles in pursuit. Bring up the van now.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.120
Go, go, go, go!

25:37.640 --> 25:38.920
" Ow!

25:55.760 --> 25:57.080
" Let's go.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.440
He's been hit. Pass me a medical bag. Now!

26:15.920 --> 26:18.600
- We're in.
- Go, go!

26:23.000 --> 26:26.240
- Jack, give me your status.
- We're away, Lee's in custody.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.360
- He's shot in the back. No exit wound.
- How bad is it?

26:29.440 --> 26:32.560
Can't tell. Doesn't look too severe.
We're on our way.

26:32.640 --> 26:37.680
- We're about 15 minutes out.
- "All right, I'll have Medical ready."

26:39.760 --> 26:43.560
- He doesn't want you to touch him.
- Tell him I need to check his wound.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.920
" Hold him down. Hold him down, now!

26:57.160 --> 26:59.560
You need to calm him down
so I can talk to him.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.800
Medical assistance is waiting
and this will ease the pain.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.520
- Does he understand?
- Yes.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.640
That's great. Thank you very much.

27:30.720 --> 27:35.560
Hey. The FAA's cleared us to leave at
eight o'clock on a medical transport plane.

27:35.640 --> 27:40.120
- Dr Besson's agreed to accompany us.
- That's great news.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.840
As soon as you settle in
I'll start looking for an apartment.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.200
I don't know what to say.

27:52.680 --> 27:56.280
- I'm gonna get through this.
- I know you will.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.160
Raines.

28:02.240 --> 28:06.520
" I have your flight information. A
medevac will be there to pick you up at 0630.

28:07.480 --> 28:13.400
- You're gonna take care of the transportation.
- "Yes, ma'am, that's correct..."

28:14.880 --> 28:18.000
I gotta call you back. Paul?

28:18.080 --> 28:20.640
Paul, what is it? Paul?

28:20.720 --> 28:24.880
Dr Besson! Please, someone come quickly!

28:24.960 --> 28:28.120
OK, OK, OK. It's OK, he's right here.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.400
Ten milligrams vasopressin.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.880
He just started gasping,
I don't know what's going on.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.240
I can barely hear his heart.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.800
- All signs point to a cardiac tamponade.
- What does that mean?

28:41.880 --> 28:46.960
The sac round his heart is filling with blood.
We can drain it, we gotta get him to surgery.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.160
If we don't stop the bleeding,
his heart will not function.

28:50.240 --> 28:54.400
- It's OK.
- Get the pericardial centesis tray now.

29:02.080 --> 29:05.480
" I need to roll him on his back.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.560
" There.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.320
Tell him we know
he helped Marwan with the warhead,

29:12.400 --> 29:16.120
and we need him to help us find Marwan
before he can detonate it.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.480
If he denies it, tell him we can prove it.

29:29.080 --> 29:33.360
He doesn't deny it. He knows where Marwan
is, he'll tell you if you agree to terms.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.560
What are they?

29:46.320 --> 29:49.760
He was seeking protection
from our government as well as Marwan.

29:49.840 --> 29:54.920
Marwan wants to kill him to prevent him from
talking. He wants our guarantee of protection.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.080
Tell him if the information
leads us to the warhead in time,

29:58.160 --> 30:03.320
he will be immune from prosecution
and I will take him wherever he wants to go.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.120
He wants a guarantee of this
in writing from the president.

30:17.200 --> 30:21.840
Tell him I understand that and I give him
my word. But I need the information now.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.880
He says guarantee first.

30:28.960 --> 30:33.160
That's not good enough. One minute.
This is... This is Bauer.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.280
- " Jack, I have President Palmer."
- Put him through.

30:36.360 --> 30:40.720
Jack, Buchanan told me you've got Lee Jong
in custody, and that he was wounded.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.000
- "Yes, sir."
- Is he talking?

30:43.080 --> 30:46.840
He won't until he has a written guarantee
he won't be prosecuted.

30:46.920 --> 30:52.400
We also have to provide safe travel. His
guarantee has to be signed by the president.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.600
Jack, CTU believes the detonation
of this warhead is imminent.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.840
- Can you force him to talk immediately?
- I don't think so.

30:59.920 --> 31:04.560
I think the fastest way to make this happen
is to give him what he wants.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.400
OK.

31:06.480 --> 31:10.000
I'll get the guarantee from Logan
and have it waiting at CTU.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.200
Thank you, sir.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.720
- What is it?
- Su Ming, the deputy Chinese consul.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.960
- They didn't waste any time.
- They have to know we're behind the attacks.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.080
What should I tell them?

31:26.160 --> 31:28.440
I'll take the call.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.960
We have to start fencing with them
sooner or later. Might as well be now.

31:33.040 --> 31:37.080
Mr Lee won't talk unless he has a guarantee
of immunity and safe transport.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.640
Get that from Logan, will you?

31:54.440 --> 31:56.680
- Mr Su.
- Yes.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.920
- Is this President Palmer?
- "Yes."

31:59.000 --> 32:03.040
Has the premier responded to the consul's
request to have Mr Lee turned over?

32:03.120 --> 32:07.000
Mr President. The consul is dead.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.800
- What?
- He was shot,

32:10.880 --> 32:16.680
when armed men broke into this building
and took Mr Lee with them by force.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.080
I am shocked and deeply saddened.

32:19.160 --> 32:22.200
Please convey that
to your government on behalf of mine.

32:22.280 --> 32:28.400
Mr President. Is it your position that
you have no knowledge of this operation?

32:28.480 --> 32:32.600
That the timing of your call and this
abduction is entirely coincidental?

32:32.680 --> 32:36.480
The consulate is sovereign territory
of the People's Republic of China.

32:36.560 --> 32:40.280
I can't believe anyone connected
with this country had a hand in it.

32:40.360 --> 32:44.400
I'm sure you understand the political
ramifications if you are incorrect.

32:44.480 --> 32:48.320
I'm sure you understand the
ramifications of unproven accusations.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.560
No accusations
have been made, Mr President.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.040
But I can assure you
there will be an investigation.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.240
Your government will have
my complete cooperation.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.480
Thank you, Mr President.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.400
I'm sure you'll be hearing from us again.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.440
Very soon.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.000
President Logan will provide Lee
with a written guarantee,

33:28.080 --> 33:30.840
as long as it remains covert.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.280
Sir?

33:36.360 --> 33:38.360
What's wrong?

33:40.240 --> 33:44.320
Koo Yin was killed
in the course of the abduction.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.720
My God! By one of our own people?

33:48.800 --> 33:53.320
No. It must have been friendly fire,
but it really doesn't matter.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.440
If they're able to find proof
that we were involved,

33:56.520 --> 34:01.720
in the long run the repercussions will be as
serious as those we face with the terrorists.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.680
Tony.

34:06.240 --> 34:10.760
I just heard that Lee Jong is on his way here
and he's been shot. How did this happen?

34:10.840 --> 34:14.719
The Chinese weren't gonna give Lee up
in time, so Jack had to extract him.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.280
Jack went into the consulate?
On whose authority?

34:18.360 --> 34:20.440
The White House.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.320
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?

34:27.400 --> 34:30.760
This needed to be off the books,
to make sure it was deniable.

34:30.840 --> 34:35.840
- But you knew about it.
- Yes, I did. I ran tactical from here.

34:39.080 --> 34:43.960
It is absolutely unacceptable
I was kept out of the loop on this.

34:44.040 --> 34:50.480
- That's the way Jack wanted to play it.
- You don't work for Jack! You work for me.

34:52.239 --> 34:56.040
A situation, frankly, I wish
I'd been consulted on in the first place.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.640
- Meaning?
- It was a mistake to reinstate you.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.120
Now I'm certain of it.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.560
Look, I understand you don't
appreciate being kept in the dark,

35:05.640 --> 35:08.360
but I think this is about something else.

35:08.440 --> 35:14.200
Well, you're wrong about that too.
And you were way out of line!

35:20.440 --> 35:22.720
OK, thank you.
Tell him we're almost there.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.000
The medical assistance
and the guarantee are waiting for him.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.640
- I can't understand him.
- Ask him if he's in pain.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.200
He says he's cold, very cold.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.640
What's going on, Jack?

35:49.480 --> 35:52.360
He must have severe internal bleeding.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.560
- His lungs are full of fluid.
- I'll alert CTU.

35:55.640 --> 35:59.360
Mr Lee. Mr Lee.
Tell me where Habib Marwan is.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.480
Please, tell me where he is now.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.400
Dammit, we're losing him.

36:12.760 --> 36:16.240
All right, stand by with the gurney.
We're coming in hot.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.400
" Jack.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.640
Jack, what's going on?

36:51.720 --> 36:54.320
- Jack?
- " You can't come in here.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.480
- He's dying!
- So's he. Get out, I just started this.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.640
This is our only connection
to a stolen warhead. Save him.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.720
- I'll get to him.
- He won't make it.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.160
- I already have a patient!
- Curtis.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.680
- You have a new one.
- Are you crazy?

37:10.760 --> 37:15.520
This is the only man who can find the
missing warhead and stop it being detonated.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.960
If you don't save him, millions
will die. Do you understand?

37:19.040 --> 37:21.720
Millions of people.
Start working on him now!

37:21.800 --> 37:26.560
- Jack, what are you doing?
- If I walk away from Mr Raines now, he'll die.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.640
- You don't know that for sure.
- Jack!

37:28.720 --> 37:30.440
Do it.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.400
Now!

37:34.440 --> 37:35.960
- More volume.
- Yes, doctor.

37:36.040 --> 37:40.440
" Jack, please. Please don't do this.

37:46.600 --> 37:51.120
" His lungs are damaged.
He's lost a lot of blood.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.760
Stabilise him so I can talk to him.
Can you do that?

37:53.840 --> 37:57.320
- Maybe. Beborah, I need you over here.
- What about Mr Raines?

37:57.400 --> 37:59.800
Chest compressions if his pressure drops.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.040
- " I got it.
- Put some gloves on.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.840
Jack. Jack!

38:08.920 --> 38:12.040
I have my orders.
I'm doing my job.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.840
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry? You're letting him die!

38:14.920 --> 38:17.400
- Get her away from me now.
- Stop it, Jack!

38:17.480 --> 38:19.480
Jack, stop! He saved our lives.

38:19.560 --> 38:24.600
" He has a tension pneumo,
we have to relieve the pressure immediately.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.480
Let go of me! Jack, listen to me.
Please, stop this.

38:28.560 --> 38:32.080
Jack, please, please,
I'm begging you, Jack, stop it!

38:32.160 --> 38:35.960
OK, let go of me. Please!

38:37.120 --> 38:40.520
Jack, Paul's crashing. Starting CPR.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.960
What can we do for him?
What can we do for him?

38:46.040 --> 38:49.600
" He's in V-fib. Use the defibrillator.

38:53.760 --> 38:57.880
- " Charging.
- " Come on, buddy.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.680
Clear.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.960
- Come on.
- " Hit him again, Jack.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.160
Charging.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.440
Clear.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.760
- He's still flatlining.
- Give him epinephrine.

39:16.840 --> 39:20.160
- Where is it?
- It's on the tray, second syringe on the left.

39:20.240 --> 39:24.600
- " Got it.
- " Inject it in the IV.

39:25.120 --> 39:28.720
- " It's in.
- Come on, please, Paul.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.000
Jack.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.960
Jack. He's dead.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.080
- Jack...
- No.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.720
- Jack!
- No!

39:59.880 --> 40:01.960
He's gone.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.160
" Oh, my God.

40:36.200 --> 40:41.960
You son of a bitch, Jack, you son of a bitch!
You killed him! He saved your life.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.240
- Get her out of here now.
- How could you? You killed him!

40:45.320 --> 40:49.480
I hate you, Jack, you killed him!
How could you do this?

40:49.560 --> 40:52.840
You killed him, Jack.
You killed him!

40:55.400 --> 40:58.240
Paul... Let go of me!

40:59.320 --> 41:03.080
Get off me!
Take your hands off, let go of me...

41:06.440 --> 41:08.440
" Suture.

41:11.800 --> 41:15.600
- Is he gonna make it?
- I'm doing the best I can.
