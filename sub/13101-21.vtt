00:01.667 --> 00:03.917
[instrumental music]

00:11.333 --> 00:12.583
We can confirm now

00:12.667 --> 00:15.333
that President Clark
took his own life

00:15.417 --> 00:17.917
at 2:53 a.m. EST

00:18.000 --> 00:20.917
'rather than face trial
for his actions.'

00:21.000 --> 00:23.333
'The body has been left
in place for examination'

00:23.417 --> 00:27.083
'and documentation
by the Justice Department.'

00:27.167 --> 00:29.125
'After the battle,
Sheridan surrendered

00:29.208 --> 00:31.583
'to Earthforce authorities
who will now decide'

00:31.667 --> 00:33.500
whether or not
charges will be pressed'

00:33.583 --> 00:36.958
'for his actions taken during
and preceding the battle.'

00:37.042 --> 00:39.083
'Despite Sheridan's current
high standing'

00:39.167 --> 00:40.542
'in public-opinion polls'

00:40.625 --> 00:43.375
'his decision to act
against his fellow officers'

00:43.458 --> 00:46.083
'must be explained
and justified.'

00:46.167 --> 00:48.625
In an impromptu
press conference this morning

00:48.708 --> 00:50.917
acting president,
Susanna Luchenko

00:51.000 --> 00:52.875
of the Russian Consortium

00:52.958 --> 00:55.167
urged the public to remain calm.

00:55.250 --> 01:00.625
We realize..
that many of you want revenge

01:00.708 --> 01:02.458
against those who caused

01:02.542 --> 01:05.667
such great pain and suffering.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.667
We ask that you listen

01:07.750 --> 01:10.375
to the better angels
of your nature.

01:10.458 --> 01:14.208
Give the courts
and the legal system time

01:14.292 --> 01:18.792
to locate and prosecute
those responsible.

01:18.875 --> 01:22.417
Only a sane and careful study
of the facts

01:22.500 --> 01:26.917
will allow us to separate those
who were willing partners

01:27.000 --> 01:29.708
in President Clark's
reign of terror

01:29.792 --> 01:34.875
from those who cooperated
only in fear of their lives.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.333
Our thoughts especially go out

01:38.417 --> 01:41.583
to Sheridan's second-in-command,
Susan Ivanova

01:41.667 --> 01:43.417
critically injured
when Clark's forces

01:43.500 --> 01:46.333
attempted to ambush
the multi-planetary fleet.

01:46.417 --> 01:49.583
'The prayers of a grateful Earth
go out to her.'

01:49.667 --> 01:51.750
Faster.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.500
We've got to go faster!

02:08.042 --> 02:10.750
[instrumental music]

02:10.833 --> 02:12.958
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

02:13.042 --> 02:14.750
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

02:14.833 --> 02:17.792
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.542
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.833
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

02:21.917 --> 02:23.417
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.042
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.958
(Londo)
It was a new age.

02:27.042 --> 02:28.792
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

02:28.875 --> 02:31.458
(Susan)
It was the year
everything changed.

02:34.250 --> 02:38.250
(Michael)
The year is 2261. The place..

02:38.333 --> 02:39.917
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

- 'It's not critical.'

03:43.417 --> 03:44.458
The treatment seems to have
worked.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.042
What about Marcus?

03:46.125 --> 03:47.458
When we found him, he was
in complete metabolic shutdown

03:47.542 --> 03:48.958
heartbeat, brain activity

03:49.042 --> 03:50.958
the machine had completely
drained his life energy

03:51.042 --> 03:52.500
and transferred it
to Commander Ivanova.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.958
- Is she stable?
- After a fashion.

04:03.042 --> 04:04.292
Woah, woah.
Woah, you can't go in there.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.750
- It's alright.
- I'm sorry, doctor.

04:05.833 --> 04:07.333
I said, go away!

04:09.500 --> 04:11.250
Susan, it's me.

04:14.417 --> 04:15.375
You okay?

04:15.458 --> 04:16.958
[sobbing]

04:19.583 --> 04:22.292
Damn it, Stephen, why the hell
did he have to do it?

04:23.292 --> 04:25.000
I didn't want him to. I never..

04:25.083 --> 04:27.333
I never would have
asked him to.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.542
I know.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.292
[sobbing continues]

04:37.250 --> 04:38.458
I know.

04:38.542 --> 04:41.000
And how the hell did he
find out about that machine?

04:43.583 --> 04:46.667
Look, after we gained custody
of the alien healing device

04:46.750 --> 04:48.833
Sheridan and I decided
that it was just too dangerous

04:48.917 --> 04:52.792
to let others know about it,
so I coded all my log entries.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.083
He must have hacked
his way through

04:54.167 --> 04:56.000
half a dozen security overrides.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.375
It's typical.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.958
He was always pulling
crap like that.

05:00.042 --> 05:02.375
Even I never knew
what to do with him.

05:02.458 --> 05:06.042
[sobbing]
He was the most undisciplined,
the most...annoying..

05:17.208 --> 05:19.708
I was just lying there,
and I was..

05:19.792 --> 05:23.375
...feeling myself
letting go of my body.

05:23.458 --> 05:27.292
And I remember the last thing
that I thought was..

05:27.375 --> 05:29.208
...I'm going to die now.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.083
'It wasn't so bad.'

05:36.167 --> 05:39.042
And then, I heard this voice
coming from far away saying..

05:41.375 --> 05:43.750
"I love you."

05:43.833 --> 05:46.083
And I thought...is this God?

05:47.875 --> 05:49.208
Is this God? I mean..

05:50.625 --> 05:52.083
He really did have
an English accent

05:52.167 --> 05:54.042
just like in all those
old movies.

05:56.292 --> 05:59.583
And then I felt myself being
pulled down, and I got heavy

05:59.667 --> 06:03.417
so heavy, you know,
tired and it was..

06:03.500 --> 06:05.625
Forced my eyes open..

06:08.667 --> 06:11.333
...and there he was next to me.

06:11.417 --> 06:15.042
And we were hooked
machine and I..

06:15.125 --> 06:16.792
I tried to pull it apart,
Stephen.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.458
I swear to God,
I tried, I just..

06:18.542 --> 06:21.125
I couldn't even move,
I couldn't move.

06:21.208 --> 06:25.250
Look, there was nothing
that you could do. Alright?

06:25.333 --> 06:28.292
Your system was traumatized.
You can't blame yourself.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.667
I don't, I don't,
I don't. I just..

06:37.583 --> 06:40.625
You know, all my life,
I've had..

06:40.708 --> 06:43.917
I've had problems
with relationships.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.000
You may have noticed.

06:49.792 --> 06:51.875
A little.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.208
You know,
the ones that I loved..

06:56.292 --> 06:59.125
...always ended up hurting me..

06:59.208 --> 07:01.542
...or leaving me.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.000
And the ones who stayed..

07:04.083 --> 07:05.667
...they had nothing inside.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.833
No depth.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.500
After a while, I just..

07:11.583 --> 07:13.667
...decided to forget about it.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.958
And...here was Marcus.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.833
I knew he'd never hurt me.

07:25.917 --> 07:28.500
And I knew he'd never leave me.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.208
[sobbing]
And I knew he loved me.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.875
I knew it. I..

07:35.958 --> 07:37.667
I just didn't want to admit it.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.375
And he gave so much and
he wanted so little in return.

07:42.458 --> 07:45.667
He just wanted a kind word or,
or a smile

07:45.750 --> 07:49.417
and all I ever gave him
in two years was...grief.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.542
And it's because..

07:55.625 --> 07:58.208
...I think I saw what I wanted.

07:59.917 --> 08:01.292
And I was afraid.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.917
I thought you knew
it wasn't gonna work out.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.750
You were just protecting
yourself from being hurt again.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.208
That's all.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.250
Maybe but..

08:13.333 --> 08:15.792
Maybe I should have
just tried one more time.

08:17.500 --> 08:20.750
I could've done that for him.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.958
Now, I can't.

08:26.708 --> 08:29.292
At least I should have
boffed him, just once.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.417
"Boffed?"

08:34.500 --> 08:36.125
Did you just say "boffed?"

08:38.083 --> 08:40.042
It's the type of thing
he would have said.

08:42.042 --> 08:44.750
I mean, hell, it's not like
I was doing anything else.

08:45.833 --> 08:47.000
Well, I guess that's one way

08:47.083 --> 08:49.125
to deal with
unrequited love, huh?

08:51.167 --> 08:52.833
[sighing]

08:54.958 --> 08:57.125
All love is unrequited, Stephen.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.750
All of it.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.792
[instrumental music]

09:09.458 --> 09:12.208
- You're late.
- No, no, no. You're early.

09:12.292 --> 09:13.667
I'm never premature.

09:13.750 --> 09:17.917
is a surprise,
given what I've heard.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.792
I'm sure it's a matter
of perspective, really

09:19.875 --> 09:23.042
but for a Narn,
two minutes must be a long time.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.958
So if you go the duration,
it's an accomplishment.

09:26.042 --> 09:29.792
But for the Centauri,
hours can go by

09:29.875 --> 09:32.458
before you even get
to the good parts.

09:32.542 --> 09:33.583
[chuckling]

09:33.667 --> 09:36.042
(Vir)
'Londo.'

09:36.125 --> 09:38.125
- You're late.
- You're late.

09:38.208 --> 09:40.625
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm...sorry. I..

09:40.708 --> 09:42.750
I, it was just that, uh..

09:42.833 --> 09:45.292
You know, th-this is
a matter of state business.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.167
I think we should, uh..

09:47.250 --> 09:49.250
Uh..

09:49.333 --> 09:50.792
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.750
Uh, G'Kar, go on ahead.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.208
We'll join you shortly.

09:54.292 --> 09:57.125
Oh, G'Kar, when we
are en route to Earth

09:57.208 --> 09:59.125
I will give you some ideas
how to deal with your

09:59.208 --> 10:01.333
little, uh, problem.

10:01.417 --> 10:02.625
[sighing]

10:03.958 --> 10:06.958
- What problem?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

10:07.042 --> 10:10.417
We are developing a very
strange relationship, I think.

10:10.500 --> 10:14.042
At times, I find I...
I rather enjoy it.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.000
It doesn't matter.
What is it, Vir?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.833
I received a message
from Homeworld

10:18.917 --> 10:20.292
just before I came here.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.708
The regent is ill.
They want you to come home.

10:22.792 --> 10:25.292
What can I do?
I am not a doctor.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.000
It's much more than that, Londo.

10:28.083 --> 10:31.625
They say the regent
will leave us

10:31.708 --> 10:33.667
early in the coming year.

10:33.750 --> 10:37.000
When that happens,
the Royal Court has decided

10:37.083 --> 10:40.000
that we need your voice
to guide us.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.583
You're going to be emperor,
Londo.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.250
'Isn't that wonderful?'

10:45.792 --> 10:47.500
[sighing]

10:47.583 --> 10:51.250
- Yes, Vir, wonderful news.
- 'Londo, I thought you..'

10:51.333 --> 10:53.292
Come, we really should hurry.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.667
Otherwise we'll have to put up
with a cranky Narn

10:55.750 --> 10:57.542
all the way to Earth.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.958
[instrumental music]

11:08.417 --> 11:09.833
(Alfred)
'Hello, captain.'

11:09.917 --> 11:12.792
'I hope you don't mind
my stopping by to visit.'

11:12.875 --> 11:15.583
I told the staff
we were such good friends

11:15.667 --> 11:19.167
like Holmes and Watson,
Rebo and Zooty.

11:19.250 --> 11:22.417
Fire and water,
snake and mongoose.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.667
This will let us speak privately
for a few minutes

11:27.750 --> 11:31.750
before they decide it's more
than ordinary interference.

11:36.625 --> 11:39.583
You never come at anyone
straight out do you, Mr. Bester?

11:39.667 --> 11:42.458
Mr. Garibaldi told me
what you did to him.

11:42.542 --> 11:46.208
Used him to uncover
a plot against the Psi Corps.

11:46.292 --> 11:49.250
Well, I'm sure
Mr. Garibaldi believes

11:49.333 --> 11:51.875
I'm responsible
for a lot of things.

11:51.958 --> 11:54.708
Like the murder
of William Edgars.

11:54.792 --> 11:56.917
So tell me..

11:57.000 --> 11:59.625
...what happened to those vials
that were stolen from his safe?

11:59.708 --> 12:02.042
You know, the ones with
the anti-telepath virus.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.667
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:08.750 --> 12:11.792
But if there were such a thing..

12:11.875 --> 12:13.875
...steps would be taken
to destroy the virus

12:13.958 --> 12:16.458
but we'd keep
the antidote around

12:16.542 --> 12:18.542
just in case someone else
came up with it.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.542
What about his wife, Lise?

12:22.333 --> 12:24.333
I have no information about her.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.792
She's no longer
any concern of mine.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.167
As for the rest..

12:30.250 --> 12:32.667
...it's Mr. Garibaldi's word
against mine.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.167
Unless you'd like
to bring in a telepath

12:35.250 --> 12:38.667
to scan him, prove that
what he's saying is true.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.917
Of course, to be admissible
in an Earth court

12:42.000 --> 12:44.417
the teep would have to be
a member of the Psi Corps.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.875
You really think you've
got it all covered, don't you?

12:53.042 --> 12:54.083
Almost.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.167
Except for one thing.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.708
I want to know..

13:06.000 --> 13:07.667
....if my lover..

13:07.750 --> 13:09.333
...was one of the telepaths
you used

13:09.417 --> 13:13.042
to disable the fleet
in your little war.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.708
Because if she was..

13:15.792 --> 13:19.417
...and if she was killed
because of it..

13:19.500 --> 13:22.375
...you have to understand..

13:22.458 --> 13:25.375
...that you will not leave
this room alive.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.292
I find it amazing that you think

13:32.375 --> 13:34.792
that threats
still mean anything to me.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.375
Do this, or you're a dead man?

13:37.458 --> 13:39.292
Death, been there, done that.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.375
Not a threat, captain,
simply a statement of fact.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.125
I can have half
a dozen sharpshooters

13:44.208 --> 13:45.875
cover this building
at every exit.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.250
As soon as you poke
your head outside

13:47.333 --> 13:48.917
'they'll put a bullet
through it.'

13:50.500 --> 13:53.167
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Bester?

13:54.375 --> 13:57.625
You use people
because you like it.

13:57.708 --> 14:00.458
And if someone gets hurt in
the process, well, that's life.

14:02.167 --> 14:04.750
Using telepaths to..

14:04.833 --> 14:06.375
...take over ships
from the other side

14:06.458 --> 14:08.792
was the hardest decision
I ever made.

14:08.875 --> 14:11.000
I had Franklin
go through their files

14:11.083 --> 14:12.583
pick out the ones
that were single

14:12.667 --> 14:15.583
no families, who were
almost certainly incurable.

14:20.042 --> 14:22.125
Carolyn is single.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.625
She has no family.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.792
The only thing we ever had
was each other.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.417
I know.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.375
I know what it's like
to lose someone

14:33.458 --> 14:37.292
only to find her,
then lose her a second time.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.583
I wouldn't wish that on anyone,
not even you

14:39.667 --> 14:41.042
as much as I might want to.

14:43.542 --> 14:48.333
Now, we selected 30 telepaths
for that job, 30 out of 100.

14:54.583 --> 14:58.125
Carolyn's still back
at Babylon 5.

14:58.208 --> 15:00.792
She'll be transferred here
as soon as things settle down.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.292
[instrumental music]

15:11.750 --> 15:13.125
Thank you.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.417
Oh, don't thank me yet.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.833
We're not done.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.500
'See, I know you.'

15:22.583 --> 15:25.500
Even with Clark gone you'll
keep moving your telepaths

15:25.583 --> 15:27.500
into positions of power.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.583
And then when the time is right

15:29.667 --> 15:31.333
you'll try and take over
the government.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.333
[laughing]

15:33.417 --> 15:34.833
You're delusional, captain.

15:34.917 --> 15:38.167
Oh, you'll wait a few years
until things quiet down.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.375
And then you'll start a war

15:39.458 --> 15:41.333
between the telepaths
and normals.

15:41.417 --> 15:45.125
And in the end, Mr. Bester,
you will lose.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.083
We'll see.

15:52.458 --> 15:54.667
Assuming you make it that far.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.000
See, Mr. Garibaldi
is finishing up

15:58.083 --> 15:59.792
some personal business on Mars.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.875
Once it's done, I imagine

16:01.958 --> 16:04.208
he'll turn his attention to you.

16:04.292 --> 16:06.875
And to tell you
the God's honest truth..

16:06.958 --> 16:08.917
...I'd rather face those
sharpshooters of yours

16:09.000 --> 16:11.250
than what he'll do
when he finds you.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.250
I don't know
exactly how he plans

16:14.333 --> 16:16.083
to settle the score, but I..

16:17.542 --> 16:20.833
I'm sure it'll be
creative, colorful

16:20.917 --> 16:22.833
and extremely unpleasant.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.542
[grunting]

16:24.625 --> 16:26.333
- Where is she?
- I'm telling you, man.

16:26.417 --> 16:27.958
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:28.042 --> 16:30.958
No? Then maybe I'm just gonna
have to explain it to you again.

16:31.042 --> 16:32.042
[screaming]

16:32.125 --> 16:33.583
Now, her name's Lise Hampton.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.208
She was married to one
of the richest guys on Mars.

16:35.292 --> 16:36.958
She got into trouble,
didn't know where to turn.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.542
I hear she went to
the Mars mafia

16:38.625 --> 16:40.042
tried to bribe her way
off the planet.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.708
Only she didn't make it,
now the way I figured is

16:41.792 --> 16:43.458
they got a little greedy,
decided to figure out

16:43.542 --> 16:44.958
how they could hang on to her
until they could exchange her

16:45.042 --> 16:46.292
for a couple of million credits.

16:46.375 --> 16:47.958
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:48.042 --> 16:51.125
Really? You're the best black
market accountant on Mars, Max.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.667
If somebody wanted to launder
some money

16:52.750 --> 16:55.125
so it couldn't be traced,
they'd come to you.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.125
- I-I can't--
- Give me a name, Max!

16:57.208 --> 16:59.250
You give me a name, and I'll
let you walk out of here

16:59.333 --> 17:01.167
with your spine in one piece.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.250
They'll kill me.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.875
Well, then you better decide
what you prefer.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.083
Now, do you want to die fast..

17:08.167 --> 17:09.417
...or do you want to spend
the rest of your life

17:09.500 --> 17:11.667
eating all your meals
through a straw?

17:19.667 --> 17:21.792
- Hello, Delenn.
- Ambassador.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.625
I suppose I should say emperor,
but you..

17:24.708 --> 17:26.250
You have heard that already?

17:26.333 --> 17:27.792
I've just found out myself.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.417
There is little that
doesn't reach me these days.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.583
G'Kar, Londo, please sit.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.458
Have you heard from Sheridan?

17:35.542 --> 17:37.917
Not since he turned himself over
to his people.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.167
The other ambassadors from
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds

17:42.250 --> 17:43.917
will be here shortly.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.667
But I wanted you to be
the first to see this.

17:47.375 --> 17:50.292
Obviously, we will need
your support.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.042
Your governments have
considerable influence

17:52.125 --> 17:53.833
with the League Worlds.

17:55.958 --> 17:58.792
Are you sure you want
to do this, Delenn?

17:58.875 --> 18:01.958
Yes, I think it's the only way.

18:02.042 --> 18:04.792
[laughing]

18:07.542 --> 18:10.208
I see nothing amusing
in this situation, Londo.

18:10.292 --> 18:14.333
No, no, you-you're right.
There isn't. It's just that..

18:14.417 --> 18:15.750
[laughing continues]

18:15.833 --> 18:18.792
I'm so rarely in the presence
of living history.

18:18.875 --> 18:22.667
It, it thins the atmosphere,
makes you giddy.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.625
[laughing continues]

18:25.833 --> 18:28.583
You realize that
you are quite mad

18:28.667 --> 18:31.042
for even considering this, hm?

18:31.125 --> 18:32.375
Perhaps.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.167
Please, come in.

18:35.250 --> 18:36.833
Yes, do please, come in.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.667
Delenn has a fascinating
proposal for you all.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.417
I hope you have brought
a change of underwear.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.583
You will need it
after you read this.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.542
Captain.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.208
General, I am tired
of just sitting here.

18:53.292 --> 18:55.542
Now, if you're going to press
charges, please do so.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.708
We've finished
our deliberations.

18:57.792 --> 18:59.583
The president's waiting outside.

18:59.667 --> 19:00.875
She'd like to speak to you

19:00.958 --> 19:04.292
assuming you have
nowhere else to go.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.292
No, no, uh, please.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.667
(male #1)
'Ten-hut.'

19:11.708 --> 19:13.375
As you were.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.500
Well, captain,
you caused quite a stir.

19:16.583 --> 19:19.500
Half of Earthforce wants
to give you a kiss on the cheek

19:19.583 --> 19:21.500
and the medal of honor.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.542
The other half wants you
taken out and shot.

19:24.625 --> 19:27.417
As a politician,
you learn how to compromise

19:27.500 --> 19:29.083
which by all rights means

19:29.167 --> 19:31.250
I should give you
the medal of honor

19:31.333 --> 19:33.250
then have you shot.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.500
I confess the idea
had a certain appeal

19:35.583 --> 19:38.375
when I mentioned it to the joint
chiefs a few hours ago.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.083
- Sit, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.250
I'll give it to you
straight, captain.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.833
President Clark
was out of control.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.000
Many of us wanted
to move against him

19:52.083 --> 19:53.750
but the time was never right.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.167
With all due respect, ma'am..

19:56.250 --> 19:59.750
While you were waiting,
innocent civilians were dying.

19:59.833 --> 20:04.000
There were issues of
planetary security to consider.

20:04.083 --> 20:08.042
To look weak or disorganized
would be to invite an invasion.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.042
We couldn't take that risk.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.167
His people were everywhere.

20:12.250 --> 20:15.250
He would have known instantly
if we were up to something.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.125
Ironically, by breaking away

20:17.208 --> 20:19.125
you were the only one
who could move against him

20:19.208 --> 20:21.417
without his knowing
what you were up to.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.875
'That's why he was
obsessed with you.'

20:23.958 --> 20:26.792
Babylon 5
was outside his control.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.458
So, yes, you saved some lives.

20:28.542 --> 20:31.417
I'm not here to argue
ethics with you, captain.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.917
Right or wrong

20:33.000 --> 20:37.208
you led an insurrection
against your own government.

20:39.375 --> 20:42.500
That's mutiny at best..

20:42.583 --> 20:44.125
...treason at worst.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.583
So, morally, I was right

20:47.667 --> 20:49.958
but politically,
I'm inconvenient.

20:50.042 --> 20:53.000
Inconvenient doesn't even
begin to cover it.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.083
Now we have to
clean up the mess.

20:57.667 --> 21:03.833
We can do that with
or without your help.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.750
What do you want me to do?

21:06.833 --> 21:10.000
I've scheduled a press
conference for tomorrow morning.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.750
I want you to there.

21:11.833 --> 21:14.667
The event wil be covered
in ISN.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.375
'You will explain
that you did what you did'

21:17.458 --> 21:20.042
for the good of Earth

21:20.125 --> 21:22.833
but your conscience
does not permit you

21:22.917 --> 21:27.167
to remain in Earthforce
any longer.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.833
'You'll tender
your immediate resignation'

21:29.917 --> 21:31.375
'and I'll see to it'

21:31.458 --> 21:35.458
'you will retain your military
pension with full honors.'

21:35.542 --> 21:38.542
And I'll guarantee amnesty
for your officers and crew

21:38.625 --> 21:41.417
who served under you
during this crisis.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.458
But I want you gone.

21:45.208 --> 21:46.875
And if I refuse?

21:48.292 --> 21:50.875
You'll be
dishonorably discharged

21:50.958 --> 21:54.417
court-martialed
and brought to trial.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.833
Same for Ivanova
and the rest of your staff.

21:56.917 --> 21:59.542
And I'll make sure
that the military tribunal

21:59.625 --> 22:02.875
is stacked with generals
from the Shoot Him category.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.875
Don't make the mistake
of assuming that

22:05.958 --> 22:08.208
this is a conversation.

22:08.292 --> 22:10.667
It isn't.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.958
You have no other options.

22:19.333 --> 22:23.083
The bitch of it is, that you
probably did the right thing.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.875
But you did it in the wrong way.

22:28.708 --> 22:31.667
In the inconvenient way.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.917
Now you have to pay
the penalty for that.

22:35.542 --> 22:38.125
I know it stinks..

22:38.208 --> 22:40.125
...but that's the way
it is, hmm.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.375
So, you tell me..

22:47.458 --> 22:49.625
...which way do you want it?

22:54.875 --> 22:57.042
Will you put the amnesty
for my crew in writing?

23:03.167 --> 23:04.958
Then I'll resign.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.750
[knock on door]

23:20.833 --> 23:22.292
It's about time.

23:27.167 --> 23:29.000
Get in here.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.583
- Did you tell him we got her?
- Yeah, yea, yeah.

23:30.667 --> 23:31.958
So how much is it worth to them

23:32.042 --> 23:33.125
to get her back alive
before I have..

23:33.208 --> 23:34.292
[knock on door]

23:45.417 --> 23:47.375
'What's going on over there?'

23:47.458 --> 23:49.833
What the hell is that thing?
Bring it on over here.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.917
[automated message]
'Th-th-th-that's all, folks.'

23:57.000 --> 23:58.958
What the..

23:59.042 --> 24:01.083
[intense music]

24:02.750 --> 24:05.500
[grunting]

24:17.875 --> 24:19.875
Lise.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.083
Lise. Lise.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.833
[music continues]

24:30.917 --> 24:32.167
Lise. Lise, where are you?

24:32.250 --> 24:34.375
(Lise)
'Here! I'm in here!'

24:34.458 --> 24:36.417
Lise, back away from the door.

24:39.208 --> 24:41.833
Oh, baby, come on.
Are you alright?

24:41.917 --> 24:43.875
Okay, I'm okay.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.250
I knew you'd come
for me, Michael.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.250
Come on, we got to get
out of here. Come on.

24:58.042 --> 25:00.750
We're entering Earth's space,
Delenn.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.250
Delenn?

25:02.333 --> 25:05.125
It is done, Lennier.

25:05.208 --> 25:07.917
The others have voted
on our proposal.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.875
When we are finished..

25:09.958 --> 25:12.375
...they will talk about this day
for 100 years.

25:14.625 --> 25:16.083
I only wish.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.958
I wish Marcus
could be here to see it.

25:19.042 --> 25:20.875
I will confess that

25:20.958 --> 25:23.917
I got used to seeing him
walking on the path beside us.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.958
He was...a part of us.

25:27.042 --> 25:29.708
But as long as
we speak his name

25:29.792 --> 25:32.042
he will always be a part of us.

25:33.292 --> 25:35.750
He followed the path
of his heart.

25:35.833 --> 25:38.458
How many of us can say that?

25:40.000 --> 25:43.750
His life before he came to
the Rangers was not a happy one.

25:43.833 --> 25:47.292
He blamed himself for the death
of his brother, so many others.

25:49.542 --> 25:51.042
Perhaps..

25:51.125 --> 25:53.292
Perhaps, saving Ivanova

25:53.375 --> 25:55.333
was the only way
he could find peace.

25:57.083 --> 25:59.333
Delenn..

25:59.417 --> 26:02.125
...did they tell you
what Ivanova said at the end?

26:03.625 --> 26:05.833
"All love is unrequited."

26:07.708 --> 26:09.500
Yes, they told me.

26:13.042 --> 26:15.208
She's wrong, of course.

26:18.042 --> 26:20.042
Of course.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.583
[instrumental music]

26:39.667 --> 26:41.625
(woman on TV)
'Continuing our coverage
of breaking events'

26:41.708 --> 26:44.042
'in the fall
of President Clark's regime'

26:44.125 --> 26:46.667
'we go now to the presidential
suite in Earth Dome.'

26:47.750 --> 26:50.833
Fellow citizens of Earth..

26:50.917 --> 26:53.750
...honored guests.

26:53.833 --> 26:57.750
I have come before you today
to commemorate those

26:57.833 --> 27:01.333
who have taken part
in this recent struggle.

27:01.417 --> 27:04.000
Who fought as they believed

27:04.083 --> 27:06.417
they had to fight.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.583
Their choice was
an unenviable one.

27:09.667 --> 27:12.500
Follow the orders
of your superior officer

27:12.583 --> 27:15.417
in acts that violate
your conscience..

27:16.958 --> 27:19.542
...or rise up in opposition.

27:19.625 --> 27:22.917
'Both sides have risked much'

27:23.000 --> 27:25.083
and suffered greatly

27:25.167 --> 27:27.167
but in the end

27:27.250 --> 27:30.167
the battle they fought
was the same.

27:30.250 --> 27:34.208
To protect
and preserve an Earth

27:34.292 --> 27:37.292
they could proudly call home.

27:38.958 --> 27:43.833
Caught in the center
of this particular whirlwind

27:43.917 --> 27:48.708
was a man of great integrity

27:48.792 --> 27:51.417
honor and courage.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.417
But his task was
a difficult one.

27:56.792 --> 28:00.375
But he executed it
with care to preserve

28:00.458 --> 28:03.167
'the lives
of his fellow officers.'

28:04.667 --> 28:07.292
Despite what you may have heard

28:07.375 --> 28:11.167
in his heart, he never left us.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.583
I give you
Captain John J. Sheridan.

28:16.458 --> 28:19.500
[applauding]

28:24.875 --> 28:26.750
Thank you, Madam President.

28:31.875 --> 28:34.208
As a young man..

28:34.292 --> 28:36.792
...I joined Earthforce because

28:36.875 --> 28:40.458
I wanted to be part of
something bigger than I was.

28:40.542 --> 28:43.208
Something that
I could believe in.

28:43.292 --> 28:46.792
And that belief carried me
through the Mars Riots

28:46.875 --> 28:49.250
the Minbari War..

28:49.333 --> 28:51.667
...and the battles that have
brought us here today.

28:54.583 --> 28:56.292
Everything I did

28:56.375 --> 28:59.542
I did out of love of Earth
and love of duty.

29:01.583 --> 29:05.250
But what happens when those two
are no longer the same thing?

29:07.542 --> 29:09.292
Now, the time
I spent on Babylon 5

29:09.375 --> 29:11.333
I learned about choices

29:11.417 --> 29:14.792
and consequences
and responsibility.

29:14.875 --> 29:17.500
'I learned that
we all have choices'

29:17.583 --> 29:20.375
even when we
don't recognize them

29:20.458 --> 29:23.542
and that those choices
have consequences

29:23.625 --> 29:26.375
not just for ourselves,
but for others.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.500
'And we must assume
responsibility'

29:29.583 --> 29:31.125
'for those consequences.'

29:32.375 --> 29:34.667
I and my fellow officers..

29:34.750 --> 29:38.083
...had to choose between
what we were told was right..

29:39.708 --> 29:41.000
...and what
we believed was right.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.708
And now I take
full responsibility

29:46.792 --> 29:48.292
for those decisions.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.958
I love Earth.

29:56.042 --> 29:58.375
And now for my love of Earth

29:58.458 --> 30:01.000
I find I must walk away
from my love of duty.

30:03.958 --> 30:07.708
My presence would be a constant
reminder of what has divided us

30:08.958 --> 30:11.750
instead of that
which brings us together.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.125
And for that reason..

30:15.875 --> 30:19.458
...and President Luchenko's
generous offer of amnesty

30:19.542 --> 30:22.000
for all those
who served under me..

30:24.708 --> 30:27.500
...I'm announcing my resignation
from Earthforce.

30:28.375 --> 30:30.583
[indistinct muttering]

30:31.625 --> 30:32.958
I do this in the hope that

30:33.042 --> 30:34.458
those who fought on both sides

30:34.542 --> 30:36.917
will put aside
their disagreements..

30:38.542 --> 30:42.208
...and come together
in a new spirit of cooperation.

30:45.250 --> 30:47.417
For we are all children
of Earth.

30:51.542 --> 30:53.333
Thank you.

30:56.625 --> 30:59.917
To commemorate
this very special day

31:00.000 --> 31:03.083
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds

31:03.167 --> 31:05.417
asked to address this gathering.

31:06.708 --> 31:07.792
Ambassador.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.625
For many years..

31:18.708 --> 31:22.583
...all of us here have prized
our good relations with Earth.

31:22.667 --> 31:24.750
You have shown
through your example

31:24.833 --> 31:28.625
that strength comes
from a multitude of voices

31:28.708 --> 31:31.958
brought together
in common cause.

31:32.042 --> 31:34.542
Humans form communities.

31:34.625 --> 31:36.958
In that spirit,
we have voted to dissolve

31:37.042 --> 31:39.125
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds

31:39.208 --> 31:41.708
and create a new alliance..

31:42.875 --> 31:45.167
...based on mutual cooperation

31:45.250 --> 31:46.583
and respect.

31:48.333 --> 31:53.167
An alliance born in the diverse
voices of many worlds

31:53.250 --> 31:56.000
joined by their desire
to build a better future..

31:57.708 --> 31:59.875
...and their decision

31:59.958 --> 32:03.583
to voluntarily recognize
a common authority.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.083
Ambassador.

32:10.167 --> 32:12.958
This new alliance will help
less-advanced worlds

32:13.042 --> 32:14.667
improve their conditions.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.333
It will encourage better
relations between our races

32:17.417 --> 32:19.458
and promote free trade.

32:19.542 --> 32:23.458
Above all,
it will work to create peace.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.708
Central to this process is
a group of humans and Minbari

32:26.792 --> 32:28.125
trained to work together

32:28.208 --> 32:30.833
and dedicated to
the higher principles of duty

32:30.917 --> 32:33.125
honor and peace.

32:33.208 --> 32:36.458
They have been entrusted with
the most advanced fleet of ships

32:36.542 --> 32:39.458
in existence now that
the first ones have left us.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.625
[rumbling]

32:44.375 --> 32:46.250
Among my people

32:46.333 --> 32:48.708
they are called the Anla'Shok.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.500
Among your people

32:50.583 --> 32:52.958
they are called the Rangers.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.750
[aircrafts whirring]

32:58.667 --> 33:01.542
[dramatic music]

33:09.292 --> 33:10.542
They come in peace

33:10.625 --> 33:13.917
and will stay only
where they are invited to stay.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.875
They will help protect you
from raiders

33:15.958 --> 33:17.875
and invasion by other races.

33:17.958 --> 33:19.042
They will work
with your military

33:19.125 --> 33:21.083
to strengthen your borders.

33:21.167 --> 33:25.750
But understand that they
will do so equally and fairly.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.375
If you are planning
a war of aggression

33:27.458 --> 33:30.583
against your neighbors,
the Rangers will hear about it

33:30.667 --> 33:32.292
and so will your neighbors.

33:32.375 --> 33:34.792
If other worlds in the alliance
choose to intervene

33:34.875 --> 33:37.083
on behalf of those
being attacked

33:37.167 --> 33:39.042
the Rangers will provide
the information

33:39.125 --> 33:41.250
but will not intervene directly.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.458
Their goal
is to create the peace

33:45.542 --> 33:47.667
not enforce the peace.

33:47.750 --> 33:51.125
'This is a political
and economic alliance'

33:51.208 --> 33:53.750
not one based
on military strength.

33:53.833 --> 33:55.167
The gains you will achieve

33:55.250 --> 33:57.375
by working peacefully
with other races

33:57.458 --> 34:01.375
far outweigh anything
you might achieve by force.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.417
The alliance recognizes
your sovereign right

34:03.500 --> 34:06.792
to govern your own people
by your own will.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.917
But membership
in the alliance means that

34:09.000 --> 34:10.542
you will honor a code of conduct

34:10.625 --> 34:12.500
in your relations
with other worlds

34:12.583 --> 34:16.375
or risk losing all the things
we stand to give you.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.583
Finally, each member race
will be able

34:18.667 --> 34:21.042
to contribute volunteers
to join the Rangers

34:21.125 --> 34:24.125
thereby assuring their
independence and fairness.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.625
All of us have agreed

34:26.708 --> 34:29.292
to recognize the independent
authority of the Rangers.

34:30.917 --> 34:34.208
Madam President, honored guests

34:34.292 --> 34:37.958
I now invite you
to join the new alliance.

34:38.042 --> 34:41.083
You may decline,
if that is your wish.

34:41.167 --> 34:44.167
We will leave in peace
and honor your decision.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.958
If you accept..

34:47.042 --> 34:49.667
...we believe
it will signal a new age

34:49.750 --> 34:52.375
of peace and prosperity.

34:57.417 --> 34:59.167
The invitation to join
your new alliance

34:59.250 --> 35:00.708
is tempting, ambassador.

35:00.792 --> 35:03.333
But many of our generals
are skeptical

35:03.417 --> 35:05.292
about your claims to neutrality.

35:05.375 --> 35:07.667
I fully understand,
Madam President.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.375
No one in this room
is more suspicious

35:09.458 --> 35:11.542
of these things than I am.

35:11.625 --> 35:14.500
No race more prideful
than the Centauri.

35:14.583 --> 35:17.375
But we are tired of war

35:17.458 --> 35:20.417
and believe that this will help
to create peace between us.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.333
Peace is a concept.

35:25.375 --> 35:28.750
If I'm going to sell this
to my generals and the public

35:28.833 --> 35:32.083
I'm going to need something
a little more tangible.

35:32.167 --> 35:34.250
Then you will have it.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.875
In the past we have kept

35:35.958 --> 35:38.792
many of our technological
advances to ourselves.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.458
In a gesture of good faith

35:40.542 --> 35:42.708
we will show you
how to use energy fields

35:42.792 --> 35:44.542
to create gravity in your ships

35:44.625 --> 35:46.542
eliminating the need
to manufacture slower

35:46.625 --> 35:50.083
less-efficient ships
that rotate to create gravity.

35:50.167 --> 35:53.833
As a space-faring race dependent
upon trade with other worlds

35:53.917 --> 35:57.292
I'm sure you see
the advantage in this.

35:57.375 --> 35:58.667
It's tempting.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.750
If..

36:01.833 --> 36:05.542
If we decide to pursue this..

36:05.625 --> 36:07.167
...who should we negotiate with?

36:07.958 --> 36:10.583
- You?
- No.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.083
The three of us

36:12.167 --> 36:15.375
make up the advisory board
of the new alliance.

36:15.458 --> 36:18.958
We have a duly
elected president, as you do.

36:19.042 --> 36:21.167
And where can
I find this president?

36:22.958 --> 36:25.625
- 'You!'
- Funny thing about retiring..

36:25.708 --> 36:26.833
You no sooner
pick out the places

36:26.917 --> 36:28.292
you wanna go on vacation

36:28.375 --> 36:30.917
then someone comes at you
with another job offer.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.250
Where's the certificate
of amnesty?

36:33.333 --> 36:37.375
Oh, that, um, I gave copies
of that to the reporters outside

36:37.458 --> 36:41.250
and the original
is someplace safe.

36:41.333 --> 36:45.583
You knew this was coming
the whole time, didn't you?

36:45.667 --> 36:49.667
The main thing was to protect
my crew from retaliation.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.458
As for the new job, well..

36:52.542 --> 36:54.625
I was hoping the League Worlds
would pull it together

36:54.708 --> 36:56.375
but you never know.

36:56.458 --> 36:58.500
I guess the war
finally taught them

36:58.583 --> 37:02.375
that we are better together
than apart, heh.

37:02.458 --> 37:05.833
We've been building this thing
up for months, bit by bit

37:05.917 --> 37:09.458
making them rely more and more
on the Rangers and each other.

37:09.542 --> 37:12.583
But if they decided
against the alliance

37:12.667 --> 37:14.625
or if they wanted
somebody else..

37:14.708 --> 37:16.167
Well, I was fine with that too.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.833
Ahem!

37:24.292 --> 37:27.125
[instrumental music]

37:30.583 --> 37:32.042
General.

37:32.125 --> 37:35.500
John, there is someone here
you may want to see.

37:39.083 --> 37:40.167
Hey, dad.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.000
[laughing]

37:45.833 --> 37:47.583
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine, son.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.042
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:49.125 --> 37:50.708
As soon as you got out
they started being real nice

37:50.792 --> 37:52.167
to me all of a sudden.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.125
I think, they figured out
they were on the wrong side

37:54.208 --> 37:56.000
and there'd be hell to pay
if anything happen.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.167
Oh, you bet.

38:00.667 --> 38:01.917
How's mom?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.542
They never got near her.

38:03.625 --> 38:05.042
She's with friends
in Minneapolis.

38:07.625 --> 38:10.250
I hear you're going to be
my new daughter-in-law.

38:10.333 --> 38:11.500
Yes.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.042
- Well, welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.583
It's been a while since I had
a place where I truly belonged.

38:17.667 --> 38:19.042
- Captain.
- Hmm.

38:19.125 --> 38:20.833
Mr. President.

38:20.917 --> 38:23.708
President Luchenko
is waiting for you, sir.

38:23.792 --> 38:25.417
Thank you.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.208
Mr. President?

38:30.458 --> 38:33.208
- It's a..
- Another long story.

38:33.292 --> 38:35.167
Well, there'll be plenty
of time for stories later.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.208
All the time in the world.

38:43.458 --> 38:44.875
Good evening.

38:44.958 --> 38:47.542
We begin our broadcast tonight
with a special report

38:47.625 --> 38:49.292
providing continuing coverage

38:49.375 --> 38:52.167
on the unfolding
Babylon 5 story.

38:52.250 --> 38:54.250
'President Susanna Luchenko
met today'

38:54.333 --> 38:56.417
'with representatives
of the newly formed'

38:56.500 --> 38:58.292
'Interstellar Alliance.'

38:58.375 --> 38:59.917
'In a historic move'

39:00.000 --> 39:03.458
Earth has agreed to join forces
with the new alliance.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.083
In the same press conference

39:05.167 --> 39:07.792
the newly elected president
of the Interstellar Alliance

39:07.875 --> 39:10.708
'John Sheridan had this
surprising revelation.'

39:11.750 --> 39:13.750
Now, in order to join
the alliance

39:13.833 --> 39:17.083
the rights of the colony worlds
must be respected.

39:17.167 --> 39:18.625
If a majority
of their population

39:18.708 --> 39:21.750
votes for independence,
they must be freed.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.667
Later this afternoon,
President Luchenko

39:23.750 --> 39:25.667
will sign an executive order

39:25.750 --> 39:29.167
declaring Mars a free
and independent world.

39:29.250 --> 39:32.375
Obviously this will have to be
ratified by the Senate.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.083
- So?
- So.

39:38.167 --> 39:42.250
Have you decided yet whether
you're going back to Babylon 5?

39:42.333 --> 39:44.875
Umm, no, not yet.

39:46.583 --> 39:49.458
I mean,
Zack's got things under control.

39:49.542 --> 39:52.333
I'm really in no rush
to make up my mind..

39:52.417 --> 39:54.333
...and I haven't had a vacation
in five years.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.458
I think I'm due
at least a few days.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.667
You know, I'm gonna need someone

39:59.750 --> 40:01.792
to help me run
Edgars Industries.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.917
Oh, boy, we do that..

40:06.000 --> 40:08.458
...they're gonna say that
I married you for your money.

40:08.542 --> 40:10.625
[chuckles]
Let them.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.625
Then I'll tell them
the real reason.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.792
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

40:17.750 --> 40:20.292
[whispering]
So let me tell you something.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.542
Oh...don't, don't.

40:23.625 --> 40:25.167
Don't-don't do that to me.

40:25.250 --> 40:26.542
No, no, no. Come on.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.750
The sun is almost coming up.

40:27.833 --> 40:32.833
I have got to get
some sleep...eventually.

40:32.917 --> 40:34.250
[Lise chuckles]

40:34.333 --> 40:36.167
(woman on TV)
'In related Babylon 5 news'

40:36.250 --> 40:38.500
'and one of his last acts
as an officer in Earthforce'

40:38.583 --> 40:40.667
'Captain John Sheridan
promoted Susan Ivanova'

40:40.750 --> 40:42.208
'to the rank of full captain.'

40:42.292 --> 40:43.542
'Citing the death
of a close friend'

40:43.625 --> 40:45.292
'and other personal reasons'

40:45.375 --> 40:47.583
'Captain Ivanova has asked
for and received a transfer'

40:47.667 --> 40:49.958
'to one of the new
Warlock-Class Destroyers'

40:50.042 --> 40:51.667
'for a one-year
shakedown cruise.'

40:51.750 --> 40:53.792
'In a statement issued
a few hours ago'

40:53.875 --> 40:55.500
'Captain Ivanova said only'

40:55.583 --> 40:57.125
'"I need to decide
where my heart belongs'

40:57.208 --> 41:00.292
'before the rest of me
can follow."'

41:00.375 --> 41:02.833
'After the press conference
in Earth Dome this morning'

41:02.917 --> 41:05.958
Sheridan and Delenn
left for Babylon 5.

41:06.042 --> 41:08.917
It's rumored that they were
married in a private ceremony

41:09.000 --> 41:11.125
aboard one of
the White Star ships.

41:11.208 --> 41:13.167
Sources tell ISN,
they will head up

41:13.250 --> 41:16.208
the newly formed alliance
from Babylon 5

41:16.292 --> 41:19.708
until more permanent facilities
can be located in Tuzanor

41:19.792 --> 41:21.000
on the Minbari Homeworld.

41:21.083 --> 41:24.875
(Londo)
Off.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.167
So..

41:27.542 --> 41:30.625
How does it feel
to make history, hmm?

41:30.708 --> 41:34.458
You do not make history.
You can only hope to survive it.

41:34.542 --> 41:36.542
G'Kar, you are
a depressing person.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.333
Thank you.

41:38.417 --> 41:40.708
And stop eating that.

41:40.792 --> 41:42.292
You don't even know what it is.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.333
Something called rice.

41:44.417 --> 41:46.375
Yes, and if it were very good

41:46.458 --> 41:48.000
do you think they would
have been standing there

41:48.083 --> 41:50.167
throwing it at people?

41:53.500 --> 41:54.875
As marriage ceremonies go

41:54.958 --> 41:57.250
the humans are
very strange indeed.

41:59.125 --> 42:01.250
Still..

42:01.333 --> 42:04.167
...they are quite a couple,
aren't they?

42:04.250 --> 42:06.125
Yes, they are.

42:06.208 --> 42:08.250
[Londo laughing]

42:09.875 --> 42:12.833
Almost makes you wish
that you could peek in on them.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.917
See how it's going.

42:21.917 --> 42:26.667
G'Kar, the artificial eye
that Dr. Franklin gave you..

42:27.833 --> 42:29.750
...where is it?

42:36.917 --> 42:39.750
[instrumental music]

42:47.083 --> 42:51.625
(Delenn)
It was the end
of the Earth year, 2261

42:51.708 --> 42:54.167
and it was the dawn
of a new age

42:54.250 --> 42:56.042
for all of us.

42:56.125 --> 42:59.875
It was the end of one chapter
and the beginning of another.

43:01.958 --> 43:05.458
The next 20 years
would see great changes..

43:05.542 --> 43:08.958
...great joy and great sorrow.

43:09.042 --> 43:12.333
The Telepath War,
the Drakh War.

43:12.417 --> 43:15.458
The new alliance
would waver and crack..

43:15.542 --> 43:17.958
...but in the end,
it would hold

43:18.042 --> 43:21.083
because what is built, endures

43:21.167 --> 43:23.583
and what is loved, endures.

43:24.375 --> 43:26.250
And Babylon 5..

43:26.333 --> 43:28.250
Babylon 5..

43:28.333 --> 43:29.792
...endures.
