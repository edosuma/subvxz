[whispering]
Lisbon.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.017
Lisbon.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.981
Don't move.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.854
'Does it bite?'

00:33.424 --> 00:35.296
- He could've killed me.
- Shh!

00:39.517 --> 00:41.215
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:43.956 --> 00:45.523
- 'CBI?'
- Yes, sir.

00:45.610 --> 00:46.785
Lisbon. Jane.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.049
Mullery.
What took you so long?

00:49.136 --> 00:51.834
Sheriff, I understand this
is a tough situation for you.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.619
Tough situation?

00:54.706 --> 00:56.143
This is Deputy Nelson Capel.

00:56.230 --> 00:59.102
Been with me 15 years.
Got three kids.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.887
He answered a 9-1-1
call last night at 10:23

01:01.974 --> 01:03.367
from a local girl,
Keeley Farlowe

01:03.454 --> 01:04.890
on her cell phone.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.066
She gave her location here

01:06.153 --> 01:07.371
and the line went dead.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.506
This is Deputy Lance Connor.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.986
[Mullery]
'Five years in.'

01:14.074 --> 01:15.858
His dad was in
high school with me.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.775
And that EMT
captain you see there

01:19.862 --> 01:23.561
crying like a baby.
That's my nephew Todd.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.476
The reason he's crying..

01:25.563 --> 01:28.088
...Keeley, that's his
fiancee,throat cut.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.525
So, yeah, tough situation.

01:30.612 --> 01:31.613
You go ahead
and look at whatever it is

01:31.700 --> 01:32.875
you wanna look at.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.398
Let me know when you're done

01:34.485 --> 01:35.834
so we can take these
folks someplace decent.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.578
Eesh. This is trouble.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.189
Interesting, though.

01:42.276 --> 01:45.801
Three different methods
of killing. Why is that?

01:45.888 --> 01:49.587
It's always bad when local
cops are personally involved.

01:49.674 --> 01:50.806
Think the feds
would want this one?

01:50.893 --> 01:52.329
The bodies have
been arranged as well

01:52.416 --> 01:55.767
not in an ostentatious way,
but there's a definite..

01:55.854 --> 01:57.465
...aesthetic at work here.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.684
He took his time.

01:59.771 --> 02:03.340
[Jane]
Yeah, it's a truly complicated
maniac we're dealing with.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.951
[Lisbon]
Yes. I think
I will call the feds.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.649
No, don't do that.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.608
I don't know why,
but I...I want this case.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.220
Or vice versa.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.833
Alright, but I have
a feeling I'm gonna be sorry.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.748
Are you people done yet?

02:19.835 --> 02:22.142
Sheriff Mullery, just
so we're on the same page

02:22.229 --> 02:25.797
in cases like these, we, the
CBI, have sole jurisdiction.

02:25.884 --> 02:29.671
Your department would have
a strictly advisory role.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.151
You can have all the
jurisdiction you want.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.935
I swear to God,
the man who did this

02:33.022 --> 02:34.937
will not live
to see a courtroom.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.159
You didn't hear that.

02:42.814 --> 02:43.989
Yep.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
I'm already sorry.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.650
[theme music]

03:01.268 --> 03:03.574
[instrumental music]

03:18.459 --> 03:19.851
What's the password for Wi-Fi ?

03:19.938 --> 03:22.202
- Say?
- 1-2-3-4.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.770
Of course.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.599
So, CBI.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.036
- Top guns.
- Not really.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.430
- I'm Agent Grace Van Pelt.
- Bob Woolgar.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.215
Number two around here.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.303
That's Hobbs.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.434
[man clears throat]

03:37.521 --> 03:38.957
Sir, may I help you?

03:39.044 --> 03:40.742
May I please speak
with whoever is in charge

03:40.829 --> 03:42.309
of the murder investigation?

03:42.396 --> 03:44.093
Why is that?

03:44.180 --> 03:46.791
I'm sorry. Are you in charge?

03:46.878 --> 03:49.011
- No, but I..
- I thought not. Ha ha.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.621
Sir, I'm with the CBI.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.406
We're in charge
of this investigation.

03:52.493 --> 03:53.798
If you have any
information about the case

03:53.885 --> 03:55.931
- I'd be happy to help.
- Miss, no offense.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.976
You are far too young
and pretty to have any

03:58.063 --> 03:59.195
authority in the matter.

03:59.282 --> 04:02.938
I shall wait...
for your chief.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.294
Hmm.

04:13.775 --> 04:17.866
[male #1]
'If you're media, keep movin'.'

04:17.953 --> 04:19.128
[shotgun cocks]

04:19.215 --> 04:20.390
CBI. Police.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.133
Put the weapon down right now.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.093
Alright. No problem.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.270
No need to shout.

04:33.621 --> 04:37.189
- And you are?
- I'm Joe Hunnicker.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.758
Keeley's my granddaughter.
I live here with her and Todd.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.587
Come on in.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.769
[Joe]
'She was a good girl.'

04:51.856 --> 04:53.597
'You know, if she and Todd
hadn't brought me in here'

04:53.684 --> 04:57.122
'on my VA check,
I'd be in a hostel somewhere.'

04:57.209 --> 05:00.343
- 'Hey, Todd.'
- Lisbon. Jane.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.695
Oh, hey. Yes, we met.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.743
[Todd]
'Really, I-I apologize
for my outburst there.'

05:08.830 --> 05:11.267
I was, uh, a little crazy.

05:11.354 --> 05:15.706
You can imagine.
I'm calmed down a little now.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.709
Rest assured, I-I won't be
pulling any vigilante nonsense.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.885
I'm very sorry for your loss.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.670
And I'm glad you
see it that way.

05:22.757 --> 05:25.194
There's no upside to taking
the law into your own hands.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.804
Revenge truly doesn't work.

05:26.891 --> 05:30.112
Well, that's just
a sweeping statement, isn't it?

05:30.199 --> 05:31.548
I'm sure we can
all think of examples

05:31.635 --> 05:33.071
where revenge
has worked splendidly.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.682
Thanks for your input.

05:34.769 --> 05:35.900
Just sayin'.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.252
Tell us about Keeley.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.605
I don't know what to say.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.389
I love her.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.348
We're getting married.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.440
- We were.
- Parents?

05:53.527 --> 05:56.051
Auto accident,
about five years ago.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.140
Drunk driver.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.663
Both dead.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.187
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

06:02.274 --> 06:05.190
About an hour before
she was due home.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.062
I called her.

06:07.149 --> 06:11.109
And I-I asked her to bring
home some beer and chips.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.851
[Todd]
'Me and Hunny, were,
were playin' gin rummy'

06:13.938 --> 06:16.724
and I could've picked her up.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.204
You know, I often do when
it's raining or whatever

06:19.291 --> 06:23.948
but last night, last night
I was just, I was lazy, I guess.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.863
This was basically
my fault that she's dead.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.476
Don't.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.826
Don't say that, son.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.089
[Joe]
'Don't take that on yourself.'

06:37.005 --> 06:38.398
Please find who did this.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.184
I just wanna know why.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.448
Why?

06:50.148 --> 06:52.455
Keeley worked the late
shift for the last year.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.762
4:00 to 10:00,
as reliable as clockwork.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.851
Great kid.
Everybody loved her.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.722
Always had a smile
for you, you know?

06:58.809 --> 07:00.507
[female #1]
'Yeah, she thought
the best of folks.'

07:00.594 --> 07:01.812
Kinda naive that way.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.901
Meaning anyone in particular?

07:03.988 --> 07:06.948
No, just, you know,
in general...trusting.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.993
Last night, what time
did she leave work?

07:09.080 --> 07:10.995
10:00 as always.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.910
On that so-and-so bicycle.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.259
I told her it wasn't safe

07:14.346 --> 07:15.304
but she said it saved money

07:15.391 --> 07:16.653
and kept her skinny.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.394
Did anything unusual
happen during her shift?

07:18.481 --> 07:20.048
Anything at all?

07:20.135 --> 07:21.441
Not that I saw.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.401
There was this trucker
that tried to pick her up.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.185
Come in a few times now.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.666
Always left her
like a 10-buck tip.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.538
He was in here yesterday
around closing time.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.496
You remember him, Rusty?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.455
She used to love to show
her engagement ring to guys

07:35.542 --> 07:37.935
to shut 'em down, but this
guy was like, "I don't care."

07:38.022 --> 07:39.894
- 'He kept on trying.'
- You get his name?

07:39.981 --> 07:42.244
It says "Greg" on his shirt.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.159
You remember him,
big, old, greasy fella.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.163
Nope. Can't say I do.

07:48.250 --> 07:52.036
He drives this truck with this
big smiling orange on the side

07:52.123 --> 07:54.996
with arms, like,
hi, I'm an orange.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.178
Examples where revenge
worked splendidly.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.093
- Nice.
- 'Uh, I was just teasing.'

08:05.180 --> 08:06.573
A little hypocritical of you

08:06.660 --> 08:08.009
to lecture him on revenge,
don't you think?

08:08.096 --> 08:09.663
How's that?

08:09.750 --> 08:12.970
Uh, all these years you've
been helping me seek revenge.

08:13.057 --> 08:16.060
- This is different.
- 'How's that?'

08:16.147 --> 08:18.019
I'm in control of the situation.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.281
Oh, really?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.373
She must have been
abducted somewhere

08:24.460 --> 08:26.593
along this stretch of road.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.856
Strange we haven't
found her bike.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.162
Maybe she didn't
head straight home.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.689
What do you mean, "You're in
control of the situation?"

08:37.299 --> 08:39.823
When the day comes,
when we find Red John

08:39.910 --> 08:42.347
I'm gonna be there to stop
you from doing anything foolish.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.524
We're gonna put him in
front of a judge and a jury.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.134
- You really believe that?
- Yes, I do.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.745
Really?

08:48.832 --> 08:50.617
I just assumed you took
that judge and jury stuff

08:50.704 --> 08:51.661
with a grain of salt.

08:51.748 --> 08:52.923
Well, you assumed wrong.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.185
No salt.

08:57.493 --> 09:00.365
You know the reality
will be different.

09:00.452 --> 09:02.324
Red John is mine

09:02.411 --> 09:04.674
and I will exact
my revenge on him.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.546
I think, when the time comes

09:06.633 --> 09:08.765
you'll see that violence
is not the answer.

09:14.075 --> 09:17.687
I had no idea your naive
idealism was so deeply felt.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.168
- Hush.
- "Hush."

09:20.255 --> 09:22.736
Hush.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.739
Excuse me. You are
Agent Teresa Lisbon?

09:25.826 --> 09:28.002
- Yes, I am.
- Good evening, ma'am.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.265
My name is Ellis Mars.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.745
I understand you are leading

09:31.832 --> 09:33.790
'the Keeley Farlowe
murder investigation.'

09:33.877 --> 09:34.922
Yes.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.272
Ah. Poor girl.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.536
I often saw her around town,
so fresh, innocent.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.147
Yes.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.890
I have information.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.805
[Ellis]
The killer is going
to strike again.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.024
Soon.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.592
And how do you know that, sir?

09:52.679 --> 09:55.856
Well, it's hard to explain.
Some call it a third eye or ESP.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.206
[Ellis]
I think of it
simply as my gift.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.077
[Jane chuckles]

10:00.164 --> 10:01.688
Not interested. Thanks though.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.081
Well, I've been waiting
here for several hours.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.648
Well, perhaps you
are more broad-minded, sir.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.390
Uh, don't get me started.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.957
I forgive your brusqueness.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.220
I can tell that you have
been visited by great tragedy.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.661
Oh, really?

10:18.748 --> 10:20.794
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to offend.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.317
I just, uh,
saw it in your eyes.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.450
Goodbye, Mr. Mars.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.670
[Ellis]
If you do need my help
again, please call me.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.716
I'll happily come back.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.721
[Grace]
'Cho and Rigsby have
gone back to Sacramento'

10:34.808 --> 10:36.157
'to pick up Gregor Hobart.'

10:36.244 --> 10:38.028
'Drives a truck for
Happy Citrus Farms.'

10:38.115 --> 10:40.030
Was seen talking to
Keeley as she left work.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.945
- What about forensics?
- They put a rush on the report.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.381
Be here first thing
in the morning.

10:43.468 --> 10:46.080
And I booked us rooms
at the nearest motel.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.430
Reasonable price.
Deputy Hobbs says it's clean.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.997
Good. It's been a long day.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.956
- Hmm.
- You alright, Jane?

10:53.043 --> 10:55.089
Oh, small-town motel,
gas station pizza.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.047
What could be better? He he.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.835
[intense music]

11:07.449 --> 11:09.103
[thinking]
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright

11:09.190 --> 11:10.757
"tiger, tiger,
burning bright

11:10.844 --> 11:12.454
"tiger, tiger, burning bright

11:12.541 --> 11:14.412
"in the forests of the night

11:14.499 --> 11:16.588
"what immortal hand or eye

11:16.676 --> 11:20.157
dare frame thy
fearful symmetry?"

11:20.244 --> 11:21.942
"Symmetry."

11:22.769 --> 11:24.771
[horn blaring]

11:28.252 --> 11:30.080
[Cho]
'Gregor Hobart?'

11:30.167 --> 11:31.168
Yes.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.127
Don't run.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.563
Wasn't going to.

11:34.650 --> 11:35.999
Yeah, well, you had
that look about you.

11:36.086 --> 11:39.437
No one calls me Gregor.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.135
- What's this about?
- Keeley Farlowe.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.919
She's dead, murdered.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.227
Oh, no.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.185
You were fond
of Keeley, were you?

11:48.272 --> 11:49.273
Yes, I was.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.276
Did you ever tell her that?

11:52.363 --> 11:55.062
Sure. I asked her out.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.586
What was her response?

11:57.673 --> 12:00.458
Uh, I think she was intrigued.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.722
She was engaged to be married.

12:02.809 --> 12:06.421
We're all sinners, brother.
Even nice girls like Keeley.

12:06.508 --> 12:07.727
And when did you
last speak to her?

12:07.814 --> 12:10.164
Yesterday, uh,
when she left work.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.819
When she left work? Where?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.516
Outside the diner
in the street.

12:14.603 --> 12:15.952
She was unlocking her bike.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.215
That makes you the last
person to see her alive.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.348
- Mm, apart from her killer.
- Right. So you said hi?

12:20.435 --> 12:23.568
Uh-huh. I said, "Hi."
She said, "Hi."

12:23.655 --> 12:25.745
'She was upset..'

12:25.832 --> 12:28.051
'...and so I
tried to make her feel better.'

12:28.138 --> 12:29.879
I told her a joke.

12:29.966 --> 12:34.101
- This goat walks into a bar--
- What was she upset about?

12:34.188 --> 12:36.538
The cook at the dinner
was hassling her on the sly

12:36.625 --> 12:39.933
grabbing at her.
You know, a secret lech.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.544
They had a tussle
just before I saw her.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.154
So she was upset.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.811
So anyway, I made her laugh.

12:48.898 --> 12:49.986
She rode off happy.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.032
And that's the last
you saw of her?

12:52.119 --> 12:53.729
Yeah.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.600
The strange thing..

12:57.733 --> 13:00.083
...when she was leaving

13:00.170 --> 13:02.390
the moon was coming up
over the hills

13:04.174 --> 13:06.960
and it looked like
she was riding to the moon.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.746
You know?

13:10.833 --> 13:13.140
I was admiring
how pretty she looked.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.492
And at the same time..

13:17.579 --> 13:19.494
...it gave me a bad feeling..

13:21.235 --> 13:22.802
...like an evil omen.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.282
We hear you were
harassing Keeley Farlowe.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.023
Putting your hands on her?

13:27.110 --> 13:28.503
No.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.548
We hear you had
a fight with her yesterday.

13:30.635 --> 13:31.811
No.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.468
It's hot in here.
Roll up your sleeves.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.427
That's okay. I'm not hot.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.127
[intense music]

13:49.393 --> 13:50.742
A cat did this.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.488
[whistles]

13:57.575 --> 13:59.490
There is no cat, Rusty.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.318
And forensics
will find your skin

14:01.405 --> 14:03.538
under Keeley's
fingernails, won't they?

14:06.454 --> 14:07.977
I want a lawyer.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.544
Leave him alone
with me for ten minutes.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.675
I'll get a confession.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.764
That's a great idea.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.549
That's not the way we work.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.029
Don't worry about it,
little lady.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.944
Go get yourself a latte.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.120
Check your e-mail.
It won't take long.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.905
Sheriff, I believe we have
some cultural differences here.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.994
I think we'll take this
gentleman back to Sacramento

14:25.081 --> 14:27.736
question him there,
avoid friction.

14:27.823 --> 14:28.955
Come on.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.352
You had her at "little lady."

14:35.439 --> 14:38.399
My aunt had a cat.
Little Charles Manson with fur.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.009
Percy he was called.

14:40.096 --> 14:43.491
- Get it? Purr-see.
- 'Interesting anecdote.'

14:43.578 --> 14:45.797
Just trying to keep
our friend at ease, right?

14:52.456 --> 14:55.285
- Hey. Hey!
- I'll kill you!

14:55.372 --> 14:57.766
[both grunting]

15:00.682 --> 15:01.726
Relax, sir.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.294
Relax and the pain will stop.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.913
Tell me why I shouldn't charge
Todd Johnson with assault.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.350
- I think you should.
- But he's a good kid.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.873
He just got carried away.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.354
Are we gonna ruin his life
with a criminal record?

15:20.441 --> 15:22.704
I mean, hasn't he
suffered enough already?

15:22.791 --> 15:26.664
Vengeance is not legal.
People need to know that.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.536
So I have justice
and humanity on my side

15:28.623 --> 15:30.016
and Lisbon has
a teachable moment.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.495
Let me talk to him.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.802
I will persuade him to
drop the notion of revenge.

15:33.889 --> 15:34.890
I'll put him back
on the right path.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.414
You think you can do that?

15:37.501 --> 15:39.112
I know I can.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.722
I've been there.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.337
Okay, go do that.

15:47.424 --> 15:50.775
And if he says the right
things and I believe him

15:50.862 --> 15:52.516
'then he can walk away.'

15:52.603 --> 15:53.778
Yes, ma'am.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.746
Have a seat.

16:07.749 --> 16:08.968
[Jane sighs]

16:09.055 --> 16:11.100
You just tried
to kill an innocent man.

16:11.187 --> 16:14.625
- Very lucky you failed.
- I didn't fail.

16:14.712 --> 16:17.759
I mean, I wasn't thinking.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.282
I don't know what I was doing.

16:21.328 --> 16:24.113
- You're sure he's not the guy?
- He's not the guy. Trust me.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.030
CBI chief wants to
charge you with assault.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.423
Well, I guess
I got it coming to me.

16:29.510 --> 16:30.990
'Unless..'

16:31.077 --> 16:33.383
Unless..

16:33.470 --> 16:35.472
...you're willing to swear
you've learned your lesson

16:35.559 --> 16:37.909
and you won't pursue
personal vengeance.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.088
I can't do that, Mr. Jane.

16:43.872 --> 16:47.528
I find who did
this to...to Keeley

16:47.615 --> 16:49.834
I will kill him.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.619
I can't swear to do otherwise.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.455
Todd, you repeat
what I tell you now..

17:03.065 --> 17:05.111
...and I will deny
every word of it.

17:07.243 --> 17:10.681
If you truly want revenge,
you have to be hard.

17:10.768 --> 17:14.555
You have to be dishonest
and devious and cold.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.430
You can't let people see
what's in your heart.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.264
Okay?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.791
So anyhow, I'm, I'm very sorry.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.055
I swear it will
never happen again.

17:40.494 --> 17:43.192
I'm glad to hear you say that.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.455
And I'm glad to say that you
can walk out of here a free man.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.067
No charges.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.285
Thank you.

17:54.551 --> 17:55.509
Thank you.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.035
That was all BS, right?

18:00.122 --> 18:02.168
Well, it sounded
pretty sincere to me.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.386
I hope you know
what you're doing.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.954
About 78 percent sure.

18:06.041 --> 18:06.998
Grace, what is it?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.783
The ballistics report came in.

18:08.870 --> 18:11.525
Deputy Connor was shot with
the same .45 caliber handgun

18:11.612 --> 18:13.135
that was used in the
Howard-Ortiz murders.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.964
- Oh, crap.
- Howard-Ortiz murders?

18:17.574 --> 18:20.011
Two months ago,
Sac PD Officer Jeff Ortiz

18:20.099 --> 18:22.057
was shot dead
by a passing motorist.

18:22.144 --> 18:25.495
Then exactly one month later,
CHP Officer Rance Howard

18:25.582 --> 18:27.323
was shot dead
with the same handgun.

18:27.410 --> 18:30.239
'Both incidents occurred late
at night on country roads.'

18:30.326 --> 18:32.850
Howard used to work here
before your time. Good guy.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.070
The San Francisco office has
the case. Did you talk to 'em?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.072
Yup, they're sending over
a copy of the case files.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.771
A serial killer
of policemen. Very interesting.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.512
This is not
a fascinating puzzle.

18:42.599 --> 18:45.254
It's a media crap storm.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.386
Okay.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.563
San Francisco
basically has nothing

18:49.650 --> 18:51.434
on the Howard-Ortiz murders.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.001
No forensics apart
from ballistics

18:53.088 --> 18:55.351
no witnesses, no leads.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.005
And Rusty Moore was
on vacation in Florida

18:57.092 --> 18:59.312
when the first murder occurred.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.923
Hobart's company log puts him
out of range in both instances.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.317
So we can discard both
of them as suspects.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.970
Well, forensics
found no suspicious DNA

19:06.057 --> 19:08.059
on Keeley or the two deputies.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.627
The tire tracks at the scene
of the crime were standard make.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.543
Over five million sold
in California alone.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.284
We got nothing, basically.

19:15.371 --> 19:18.722
Well, except a monthly
pattern, a .45 caliber handgun

19:18.809 --> 19:20.376
and a grudge
against the police.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.465
[Rigsby]
'But why Keeley?
She's not police.'

19:22.552 --> 19:24.685
Why not Keeley?

19:24.772 --> 19:26.339
He sees her riding along.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.949
It's easy to knock
her off her bike.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.908
Now he has bait to lure
the deputies into a trap.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.084
In any case, the killer's
gotten more elaborate.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.825
It started with
a simple drive-by.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.828
Now we have multiple victims,
staging of bodies, arson.

19:37.915 --> 19:41.310
He's beginning to enjoy
himself, spreading his wings.

19:41.397 --> 19:45.619
I'm reading your interview with
Hobart, the poetical trucker.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.970
He says that when Keeley
rode off, and I quote

19:49.057 --> 19:50.885
"The moon was coming
up over the hills

19:50.972 --> 19:53.801
"and it looked like she was
riding to the moon, you know?

19:53.888 --> 19:56.107
"And I was admiring
how pretty she looked.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.937
"And at the same time,
I had a bad feeling about it..

20:00.024 --> 20:01.548
...like an evil omen."

20:05.639 --> 20:06.596
Moon rises in the east.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.163
So she was riding east.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.252
But her route home
is west of the diner.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.123
She wasn't headed home
when she left work.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.560
We've been looking
for the abduction site

20:13.647 --> 20:15.214
on the wrong stretch of road.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.827
[instrumental music]

20:27.922 --> 20:31.578
[Mullery]
'Yeah, that's Keeley's bike.'

20:31.665 --> 20:33.101
Okay.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.755
We're gonna have to
cordon off this whole area.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.322
I'm gonna call forensics,
get some techs down here.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.500
Where does this go?
Where-where was she headed?

20:40.587 --> 20:42.545
Um, about half
a mile down, there's a..

20:42.632 --> 20:44.634
...make-out spot
the local kids use.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.681
After that, nothing till you get
to Gainesville, 20 miles away.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.901
[Rigsby]
'Hey, I got somethin'.'

20:52.642 --> 20:54.688
Looks like a button from
a pea coat type of thing..

20:54.775 --> 20:55.732
...like sailors wear?

20:55.819 --> 20:57.212
Sailors and, uh..

20:57.299 --> 20:59.780
[both]
Firemen.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.087
[Cho]
We're investigating
the Orchard murders.

21:03.174 --> 21:04.393
We need a list
of all the firefighters

21:04.480 --> 21:06.352
that weren't on duty
the night before last.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.485
And anyone who was supposed to
be on duty but didn't show up.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.313
Okay.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.662
You look troubled.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.708
No.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.666
Yeah, actually, I mean,
there was one guy

21:16.753 --> 21:18.625
who didn't show up
that night, but..

21:18.712 --> 21:20.583
...there's no way.
He's-he's not that kind of guy.

21:20.670 --> 21:23.064
What's his name?

21:23.151 --> 21:25.371
Kitchen. Ben Kitchen.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.547
And where can
we find Mr. Kitchen?

21:30.506 --> 21:32.465
Yo, Kitch. Get out here.

21:36.860 --> 21:39.167
These detectives
wanna talk to you.

21:44.085 --> 21:46.087
[Ben]
Okay. What'd I do?

21:46.174 --> 21:47.915
How'd you lose your eyebrows?

21:48.002 --> 21:50.918
Barbecue accident at home.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.616
And why didn't you come into
work the night before last?

21:53.703 --> 21:55.488
Stomach bug.

21:55.575 --> 21:56.532
Might be it was the barbecue.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.926
[chuckles]

22:00.275 --> 22:01.668
What's this about?

22:01.755 --> 22:02.712
Your lack of eyebrows.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.369
I know what she looks like.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.023
I didn't kill her.

22:09.110 --> 22:12.156
I was home, like I said
a million times now.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.029
You say that
but you have no proof.

22:15.116 --> 22:18.075
I don't need proof.
You need proof.

22:18.162 --> 22:20.687
You have a bad attitude.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.603
- What's the matter?
- My face hurts.

22:23.690 --> 22:26.736
You don't like policemen?

22:26.823 --> 22:29.565
Don't love 'em.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.262
It's nothing personal.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.830
It's a firefighter's tradition.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.049
[cell phone ringing]

22:37.051 --> 22:38.661
Sheriff Mullery.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.534
Hey, Lisbon, I hear you
got a suspect in custody.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.666
Oh, yeah. He looks
pretty good for it.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.626
- A firefighter, huh?
- Yeah. Ben Kitchen?

22:46.713 --> 22:48.279
[Mullery on phone]
'Yeah, I know him.'

22:48.367 --> 22:50.194
Alright. Look, I'm on
my way to the office now.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.675
Oh, it's alright, Sheriff.
It's early days yet.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.111
- We don't even know if--
- Don't worry.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.287
I won't interfere.
I learned my lesson..

22:56.375 --> 22:57.506
[gunshot]

22:59.943 --> 23:00.988
Hello?

23:01.815 --> 23:02.903
'Sheriff?'

23:04.557 --> 23:06.254
[Lisbon on phone]
'Sheriff Mullery? Hello?'

23:08.474 --> 23:09.562
'Hello?'

23:14.088 --> 23:15.655
[instrumental music]

23:38.591 --> 23:40.244
Waiting for confirmation
from ballistics

23:40.331 --> 23:42.943
but the ME took what looks
like a .45 slug from Mullery.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.467
Same caliber as the
previous murders, same MO.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.556
So we have to assume
it's the same shooter

23:47.643 --> 23:49.210
only a different schedule.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.342
Three days from the last
murder instead of a month.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.735
Why the change?

23:52.822 --> 23:54.607
Because he had to kill Mullery.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.870
Because Mullery
discovered something.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.394
Why did Mullery
keep it quiet then?

23:59.481 --> 24:02.571
And how did the killer know that
he had discovered something?

24:02.658 --> 24:04.486
Good questions.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.836
Sir, I don't care what you have
to say, you're not allowed in.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.534
Please, deputy,
I am trying to help.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.231
Hobbs, it's okay.
I'll deal with him.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.408
What brings you
back here, Mr. Mars?

24:13.495 --> 24:15.454
I'm sorry. I never
caught your name.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.673
Patrick...Jane.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.414
[Ellis]
Patrick.

24:19.501 --> 24:23.549
Patrick, I don't mean
to be self-serving

24:23.636 --> 24:25.899
but I did tell you there
would be another killing.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.117
Yes, you did.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.599
Poor Mullery.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.732
Lisbon was actually on
the phone with him when he died.

24:34.385 --> 24:35.909
Well, I suppose we owe
you an apology, but, uh--

24:35.996 --> 24:38.085
No! No, no, no.

24:38.172 --> 24:41.262
Without doubt,
there can be no faith.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.569
All I ask is that
you'll listen to me now

24:43.656 --> 24:45.222
with, uh, an open mind.

24:45.309 --> 24:48.574
Now that you know
what I say is true

24:48.661 --> 24:51.098
perhaps you can imagine
how helpful I can be to you.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.841
Can you imagine that?

24:57.757 --> 24:59.367
Are you trying to hypnotize me?

24:59.454 --> 25:00.803
No.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.457
[chuckles]
Patrick, of course not.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.154
[chuckles]
Felt a little weird.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.895
[Ellis]
Yeah. I know.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.897
Trying is nothing.
Doing is everything.

25:07.984 --> 25:11.945
All I'm doing is asking...
for you to let me helpyou.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.642
Hmm?

25:13.729 --> 25:16.297
I can help you.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.649
You can help us.
Come on in.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.477
Thank you. Ahem.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.743
Lisbon. Sheriff.
You remember Mr. Mars?

25:27.830 --> 25:29.484
- Yes.
- He can help.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.573
- Really?
- He can?

25:31.660 --> 25:33.793
Well, I know you're skeptical
but please, hear him out.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.316
I think you'll
be very impressed.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.187
I need to run to the store.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.233
Then we should take him out to
Keeley's place to look around.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.278
I'll be right back.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.588
- 'I sense that you're upset.'
- Oh, really?

25:46.675 --> 25:49.591
Oh, yes, I see.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.550
You were the last
person to speak

25:51.637 --> 25:53.247
with Sheriff Mullery,
weren't you?

25:53.334 --> 25:54.770
Yes.

25:54.857 --> 25:57.947
Oh, I see you right
there when he died.

25:58.034 --> 26:01.516
Ahem. No. No. Ahem.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.649
Right there but not there.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.088
You were on the phone
with him when he died.

26:08.175 --> 26:11.787
- Whoa.
- How did you know that?

26:13.659 --> 26:15.138
A psychic?

26:18.011 --> 26:19.621
You're kidding me.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.191
Come on.

26:24.278 --> 26:25.888
This guy's good.

26:31.894 --> 26:34.288
[instrumental music]

26:45.125 --> 26:46.909
What room is that?

26:46.996 --> 26:49.651
- It's the bathroom.
- Uh-huh.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.174
So what's the gag?

26:51.261 --> 26:53.568
Because this appears to
be an absurd waste of time.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.092
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
Wait a minute, though.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.051
You'll enjoy the next part.

26:58.138 --> 27:01.054
The mark of a good psychic
is the ability to improvise

27:01.141 --> 27:03.491
to use to
your advantage whatever

27:03.578 --> 27:05.362
props might come to hand.

27:05.449 --> 27:06.407
Ah.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.677
What is it? A tooth?

27:15.764 --> 27:17.157
A wolf's tooth.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.941
Where on earth would
a wolf's tooth come from?

27:21.988 --> 27:25.252
The killer must
have left it here.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.993
It's a sign.

27:28.734 --> 27:33.086
As a clairvoyant, a man
of clear sight, if you will

27:33.173 --> 27:36.524
it's my opinion the killer has
a strong lycanthropic complex.

27:36.611 --> 27:39.701
He believes he's
a werewolf or a wolf man.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.747
"Were" being an
Anglo-Saxon word for "man."

27:41.834 --> 27:44.140
And hence, of course, the
monthly pattern of his crimes.

27:44.227 --> 27:47.013
His behavior is driven
by the phases of the moon.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.319
[female #2]
'You say there's a killer out
there who turns into a wolf?'

27:49.406 --> 27:51.017
No, no, no.

27:51.104 --> 27:53.280
No, I'm saying there's
a killer out there who believes

27:53.367 --> 27:57.501
he turns into a wolf, and so he
isa wolfand behaveslike one.

27:57.588 --> 28:01.984
The mind is a powerful machine.
It can create reality.

28:02.071 --> 28:03.420
[Ellis]
'And that is all I will say..'

28:03.507 --> 28:05.684
Now I think I know
what your game is.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.033
- Really?
- Hmm.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.295
I'd be very
surprised if you did.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.557
Ouch!

28:11.602 --> 28:13.517
Of course. You're right.

28:13.604 --> 28:15.345
The killer is driven by
the phases of the moon.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.608
That is brilliant.
How did you work that out?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.436
Simple deduction.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.177
And the last killing didn't
break the pattern at all.

28:21.264 --> 28:24.311
It simply initiated
a different lunar cycle.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.923
- Exactly.
- So tonight's a big night, huh?

28:28.010 --> 28:30.578
- Tonight?
- 'Moon's at it's apogee.'

28:30.665 --> 28:32.014
I'm no astrologer, but, uh..

28:32.101 --> 28:33.233
...isn't that
a highly charged moment?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.278
Uh, it, uh, it can be.
It depends.

28:35.365 --> 28:38.151
[Jane]
And since serial killers
always have a very strong urge

28:38.238 --> 28:40.414
to return to the scene
of their crimes.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.155
- Oh?
- Yeah.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.678
I wouldn't wanna be up
in those hills tonight.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.724
That werewolf stuff
gives me the creeps.

28:45.811 --> 28:49.118
[laughs]
Well, it's, uh, easy to be
scared of the unknown, hmm?

28:49.205 --> 28:52.731
- Would you excuse me?
- Well, of course.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.297
- Huh? Hmm?
- 'Mr. Mars?'

28:54.384 --> 28:57.474
[male #2]
'Can I get one of those?'

28:57.561 --> 28:59.128
- 'Here, have one, please.'
- 'Thank you.'

28:59.215 --> 29:01.609
Sheriff Woolgar,
do you have any deputies

29:01.696 --> 29:03.524
watching over
the original crime scene?

29:03.611 --> 29:05.091
No. Why?

29:05.178 --> 29:07.354
Well, I've been thinking
about all this wolf stuff

29:07.441 --> 29:09.965
and it occurs to me that it's
very likely that the killer

29:10.052 --> 29:11.793
will return to
the scene of the crime.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.055
Why?

29:13.142 --> 29:15.449
Well, serial killers do,
don't they?

29:15.536 --> 29:18.626
Well, some do and some don't.

29:18.713 --> 29:19.627
Someone that thinks
they're a wolf

29:19.714 --> 29:21.760
will almost certainly return.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.762
Wolves always
return to their kills.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.766
They do.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.333
I'll put some men up there.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.508
That's smart.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.385
[intense music]

29:46.349 --> 29:48.787
[screams]

29:49.788 --> 29:50.789
Help!

30:03.453 --> 30:05.673
[music continues]

30:05.760 --> 30:06.892
[panting]

30:17.250 --> 30:18.425
[grunts]

30:26.302 --> 30:28.696
[music continues]

30:34.876 --> 30:37.270
[panting]

30:42.275 --> 30:43.842
[whimpers]

30:46.192 --> 30:47.758
Good evening. Get in.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.327
[grunts]

30:56.550 --> 30:58.857
What on earth
are you doing out here?

30:58.944 --> 31:00.162
[panting]

31:00.249 --> 31:01.642
I was waiting for the killer..

31:03.296 --> 31:04.645
...but he saw me.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.516
'He chased me.'

31:06.603 --> 31:08.562
That wasn't the killer.
That was the police.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.738
And now they probably
think you're the killer.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.785
[panting]
Oh, my God. Oh!

31:14.873 --> 31:16.352
This is your fault.

31:16.439 --> 31:19.051
Excuse me? How so?

31:19.138 --> 31:20.487
Did I tell you to go out there
in the middle of the night?

31:20.574 --> 31:22.619
No, I did not.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.447
[grunts]
I'll go to the police.
I'll explain things to them.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.362
They'll see.
It's, uh, a misunderstanding.

31:26.449 --> 31:28.016
Yeah, sure, they will.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.670
They'll only keep you
locked up a couple of days.

31:29.757 --> 31:32.412
As long as no angry cops try
to take revenge, you'll be fine.

31:32.499 --> 31:35.067
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:35.154 --> 31:39.201
Don't worry. I'll help you.
We can fix this, okay?

31:39.288 --> 31:40.681
Just trust me.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.125
[instrumental music]

31:50.212 --> 31:51.344
Todd, It's Jane.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.650
Meet me at the Sheriff's office.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.264
[whispers]
Lisbon.

31:58.351 --> 32:01.223
Lisbon, get dressed. I have
an excellent play in motion.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.096
Lisbon.

32:05.880 --> 32:09.449
- What is it?
- Uh, get dressed.

32:09.536 --> 32:10.754
I have an excellent
play in motion.

32:10.841 --> 32:11.973
Huh?

32:17.326 --> 32:19.720
[instrumental music]

32:22.375 --> 32:23.811
[Bob]
'We're about to crack
the biggest case'

32:23.898 --> 32:25.117
'this area's had in a long time'

32:25.204 --> 32:27.119
'and we are
running out of time.'

32:28.990 --> 32:32.254
I want him flagged for arrest
at all the airports in the area.

32:32.341 --> 32:33.864
What's happening?
They found someone?

32:33.952 --> 32:36.476
Ask Sheriff Woolgar.

32:36.563 --> 32:37.956
Well then, let me
talk to someone who can

32:38.043 --> 32:40.349
for crying out loud!

32:40.436 --> 32:43.352
- Yes, I'll wait!
- What's the rumpus?

32:43.439 --> 32:45.180
Bob, it's okay. I promise
I won't do anything crazy.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.008
I just want to know.

32:47.095 --> 32:50.403
My guys spotted Ellis Mars
creeping around the crime scene.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.883
He ran off when
challenged, left his car.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.537
We found dried blood and a long

32:54.624 --> 32:56.670
dark human hair
on the back seat.

32:56.757 --> 32:57.932
It's on its way
to forensics now.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.542
Ellis Mars?
That doesn't make sense.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.370
Well, we should've
realized before.

33:01.457 --> 33:04.591
He knew Lisbon was on the phone
with Mullery when he died.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.854
- Psychic powers, he said.
- Wait. He knew that?

33:06.941 --> 33:08.856
- How-how could he know that?
- Exactly.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.641
He's not psychic. He was there.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.556
Yeah, but he, he's
been helping you guys.

33:13.643 --> 33:16.864
It's a common psychopathic
profile, classic almost.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.605
They seek a part
in the investigation

33:18.692 --> 33:19.867
they seek the spotlight.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.738
- Well, where is he now?
- We don't know.

33:23.653 --> 33:29.485
Hey! This is acting Sheriff
Woolgar, Vineland township. Yes.

33:29.572 --> 33:32.532
Count to ten,
then meet me outside.

33:32.619 --> 33:35.013
Well, what the heck do I have to
do to get people at the airport?

33:36.666 --> 33:37.841
Yes, now!

33:42.498 --> 33:44.892
[intense music]

33:49.418 --> 33:50.463
Get in.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.990
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.209
Get in.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.922
[music continues]

34:25.889 --> 34:28.631
Ellis Mars is in room 21.

34:28.718 --> 34:31.547
Consider it a gift
from a brother in arms.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.854
I hope someday someone
will do the same for me.

34:43.733 --> 34:44.952
You're messing with me.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.868
No.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.435
I'll show you.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.702
[intense music]

35:09.411 --> 35:11.152
See?

35:11.239 --> 35:13.676
- Oh, my God.
- Go ahead.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.899
What are you waiting for?

35:18.986 --> 35:21.293
This guy cut Keeley's throat
and watched her die.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.468
I-I didn't.

35:22.555 --> 35:24.122
Don't bother lying to us, Mars.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.298
We found Keeley's blood
and hair in your car.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.430
That's impossible!

35:28.517 --> 35:30.171
What's going on, Todd?

35:32.739 --> 35:35.785
I'm not gonna shoot this guy.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.874
All that talk of revenge
was just hot air, was it?

35:37.961 --> 35:41.791
- You don't have the guts.
- Oh, I got the guts, alright.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.619
I just don't know
for sure he did it.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.708
We have hard
evidence against him.

35:45.795 --> 35:49.973
Yes, you do
and I don't understand that.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.846
[Todd]
I guess you're framing him
for some reason but why?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.545
And why would you
want me to kill someone

35:56.632 --> 35:58.199
who didn't really do it?

35:58.286 --> 36:00.897
What's your game?

36:00.984 --> 36:02.334
Huh?

36:02.421 --> 36:04.423
You're setting
me up, aren't you?

36:06.251 --> 36:09.819
Or I'm simply telling you
the truth and Mars is guilty.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.560
No.

36:13.127 --> 36:15.608
No?

36:15.695 --> 36:16.609
And you're sure?

36:20.700 --> 36:22.571
Yeah, well, you're right.

36:22.658 --> 36:26.271
Mars' only crime
is foolishness and fraud.

36:26.358 --> 36:27.968
I set him up.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.404
Get outta here.

36:33.713 --> 36:34.844
[door closes]

36:38.108 --> 36:39.632
What's this about?

36:41.416 --> 36:44.158
See, the thing is, Todd

36:44.245 --> 36:48.293
there's only one way you can
be so sure of his innocence.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.033
It was you that killed Keeley

36:50.120 --> 36:53.298
and Mullery
and all of those cops.

36:53.385 --> 36:54.908
You're nuts.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.039
Oh, don't-don't bother
with the song and dance.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.302
I'm satisfied you're guilty.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.391
You're a garden
variety psychopath.

36:59.478 --> 37:02.437
Probably been killing random
people here and there for years.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.179
I'm not sure why you
turned on cops all of a sudden

37:05.266 --> 37:07.137
but I'm sure you
have your good reasons.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.791
Your dad was a cop, right?

37:08.878 --> 37:10.532
Yes, he was.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.752
He was mean to you.
Made you hate policemen maybe?

37:12.839 --> 37:13.970
No.

37:14.057 --> 37:15.537
He was a kind and gentle man.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.409
Then who was it
that made you this way?

37:17.496 --> 37:18.540
And please don't say
it was your mother.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.499
That'd be too cliche.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.502
No, my mother was a saint.

37:23.589 --> 37:26.374
You're mistaken
about me. Really.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.246
Really?

37:28.333 --> 37:31.466
Oh, well, let me
run it down for you.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.426
You killed Keeley because
she was getting too clingy.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.080
She was asking too many
questions about your other life.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.821
[Jane]
She bugged you.

37:38.908 --> 37:41.955
Mullery died because he
recognized that button as yours

37:42.042 --> 37:43.348
and he asked you about it.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.263
You stalled him..

37:45.350 --> 37:47.308
...then you
had to kill him quick.

37:47.395 --> 37:48.570
Broke the monthly pattern

37:48.657 --> 37:51.747
which wasn't about
the moon, of course.

37:51.834 --> 37:54.315
Once a month,
Hunnicker got his VA check.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.578
'Goes on a binge,
drinks till he blacks out'

37:56.665 --> 37:57.927
and gives you an alibi.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.320
How am I doing so far?

38:01.017 --> 38:03.063
- You're very clever, Mr. Jane.
- Thank you.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.761
I must confess,
I underestimated you.

38:05.848 --> 38:08.373
More like you
overestimated yourself, Todd.

38:08.460 --> 38:11.941
No. You say that only 'cause you
don't see the whole big picture.

38:12.028 --> 38:16.119
There's a reason
for everything I've done.

38:16.206 --> 38:19.035
- What's the big picture?
- You'll never know.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.081
Right. There's no big picture.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.952
Oh, trust me.

38:23.039 --> 38:26.956
It would blow...your...mind.

38:27.043 --> 38:29.959
[clicks]

38:31.221 --> 38:34.181
No firing pin. Oops.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.226
Of course.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.708
Cho! Rigsby!

38:39.795 --> 38:42.145
- Drop the weapon!
- Hands on your head!

38:44.017 --> 38:47.020
- Uh..
- You're under arrest.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.807
[instrumental music]

39:09.956 --> 39:11.087
[door opens]

39:13.612 --> 39:15.135
What is it?

39:16.832 --> 39:18.312
I've changed my mind.

39:18.399 --> 39:20.532
I want to talk.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.098
That's a smart move.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.884
But I'll only
talk to Mr. Jane.

39:24.971 --> 39:27.103
Why is that?

39:27.190 --> 39:29.236
We have a connection.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.369
Maybe he doesn't
want to talk toyou.

39:33.501 --> 39:34.981
Tell him I have a secret.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.506
A secret only
he will understand.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.948
A secret, huh?

39:46.035 --> 39:48.037
That's what he said,
that you were the only one

39:48.124 --> 39:51.301
who would understand, that
you and he had a connection.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.260
He's just trying
to lend an air of mystery

39:53.347 --> 39:55.262
to his sad little
story of madness.

39:57.177 --> 40:00.223
The case will go a lot easier
if we can get him to talk.

40:00.310 --> 40:03.096
I have spent enough
time with that creep.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.055
Staring into the abyss.
You know, it's not healthy.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.361
[Lisbon]
Please?

40:07.448 --> 40:09.494
Just hear what he has to say.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.409
He's right downstairs
in the holding cell.

40:11.496 --> 40:13.323
[Jane sighs]

40:31.341 --> 40:33.735
[dramatic music]

40:37.391 --> 40:39.437
[Todd grunting]

40:45.355 --> 40:47.183
[panting]

40:57.324 --> 40:59.718
PSU is starting
an investigation.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.328
They figure it's
somebody getting revenge

41:01.415 --> 41:04.026
for Officer Howard.

41:04.113 --> 41:06.594
They'll need to speak
with you later today.

41:06.681 --> 41:07.856
Okay.

41:09.292 --> 41:11.947
Doctor says his systems
are shutting down.

41:12.034 --> 41:13.514
That he probably won't
regain consciousness.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.433
[ECG machine beeping]

41:21.391 --> 41:24.786
Okay, then. I'm gonna go
finish up the paperwork now.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.625
[grunts]

41:42.848 --> 41:43.979
[beeping continues]

41:46.634 --> 41:49.463
"Tiger, tiger."

41:54.120 --> 41:55.991
[beeping intensifies]

41:56.992 --> 41:57.906
[flat lines]

41:58.690 --> 41:59.821
[rapid beeping]

42:12.791 --> 42:15.184
[intense music]

42:30.548 --> 42:32.854
[male narrator]
Stay tuned for scenes
from out next episode.
