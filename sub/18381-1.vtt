00:46.334 --> 00:49.167
No, no, no, no.
This line starts behind me.

00:49.251 --> 00:50.501
Oh.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.626
That'll be 50 kronor, please.

00:55.709 --> 00:58.334
Nope. That'll be 35 kronor.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.584
This is only valid
when you buy two bunches.

01:02.917 --> 01:05.917
Well, my dear,
I actually only want one bunch.

01:06.001 --> 01:09.042
And unless I'm mistaken,
half of 70 is still no more than 35.

01:09.126 --> 01:11.084
One bunch is 50 kronor

01:11.167 --> 01:14.209
and two bunches will be 70 kronor
with that coupon of yours.

01:14.292 --> 01:16.001
That's all wrong!

01:16.667 --> 01:19.001
That's totally insane!

01:19.084 --> 01:21.584
I'll be reporting you
to the consumer ombudsman.

01:22.376 --> 01:23.834
Is your boss around?

01:24.501 --> 01:25.876
No, she's having lunch.

01:26.334 --> 01:27.584
Lunch?

01:28.001 --> 01:30.417
Working on her times tables
would have been more useful.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.751
<i>Two prices for one thing.</i>

01:43.292 --> 01:45.251
That's totally insane!

01:51.251 --> 01:56.042
But just so you know:
Two bunches is a one-off.

02:01.751 --> 02:03.084
Miss you.

02:04.751 --> 02:12.751
A MAN CALLED OVE

03:25.167 --> 03:26.751
Good-for-nothings...

03:52.584 --> 03:54.876
ALL CAR TRAFFIC FORBIDDEN

04:10.376 --> 04:12.167
That dog mustn't pee on our slabs.

04:12.251 --> 04:14.334
Don't listen to that nasty man, Prince.

04:15.501 --> 04:16.250
Anders!

04:16.334 --> 04:18.416
See that? He tried to kill Prince!

04:18.500 --> 04:19.500
Leave the dog alone.

04:19.584 --> 04:20.584
That's no dog.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.376
It looks more
like a hairy winter boot with eyes.

04:23.459 --> 04:26.251
- It's forbidden to walk your pets here.
- Stop playing the policeman.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.501
Why don't you tell him?
You're chairman of the board, after all.

04:29.584 --> 04:30.959
I just did.

04:31.042 --> 04:32.709
I meant properly!

04:50.042 --> 04:51.376
Good morning?

04:54.751 --> 04:56.084
Alright?

04:56.876 --> 04:58.209
Feeling chatty?

05:01.501 --> 05:02.542
Ove?

05:03.001 --> 05:05.292
Great.
Could you pop around for a minute?

05:05.376 --> 05:06.667
Into the office.

05:09.251 --> 05:11.334
Promotion awaits, I think.

05:15.292 --> 05:16.917
- Alright?
- Yup.

05:18.751 --> 05:22.334
- How long have you been working here, Ove?
- 43 years.

05:22.876 --> 05:24.542
- Shit.
- Shit.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.959
You took over after your father,
didn't you?

05:29.292 --> 05:30.751
Yup.

05:31.417 --> 05:35.334
Well, you see, we've come up
with a possibility for you.

05:35.417 --> 05:38.084
You're only 59 years old,

05:38.167 --> 05:40.792
and you might want to do
something else in life?

05:45.292 --> 05:47.834
Is that what 43 years
of loyal service says to you?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.084
Well...

05:53.042 --> 05:54.376
Are you trying to fire me?

05:54.459 --> 05:57.751
Well,
we certainly wouldn't call it that...

05:57.834 --> 06:00.167
but it may look a bit like it, though.

06:00.251 --> 06:03.001
We want to offer you a program.

06:03.084 --> 06:05.084
A state-run kind of training course.

06:05.167 --> 06:06.959
A way of moving forward.

06:07.042 --> 06:09.251
Everything's being digitalized now.

06:09.584 --> 06:11.709
If so, I've got an idea, too.

06:13.042 --> 06:16.001
Wouldn't it be much simpler
if I just got up and walked out of here?

06:19.751 --> 06:22.542
- Good. That's that, then.
- Well...

06:23.084 --> 06:27.501
One second, though, Ove.
We have a parting gift.

06:29.501 --> 06:31.292
It's a spade for gardening.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.459
<i>Well, if you're going away,
you shouldn't end your subscription.</i>

07:19.542 --> 07:21.001
<i>You should be taking it with you.</i>

07:21.084 --> 07:23.417
There are no phones where I'm going.

07:23.501 --> 07:24.501
<i>Seriously?</i>

08:50.751 --> 08:52.126
Easy does it!

08:52.209 --> 08:54.376
Come on. Yes. Careful!

08:54.459 --> 08:56.084
Hello? Hello!

09:00.876 --> 09:02.542
Stop. Stop!

09:02.626 --> 09:03.834
Stop!

09:04.667 --> 09:07.751
- Oops... Go forwards a little.
- What the hell?

09:08.751 --> 09:11.001
Go forwards a little. Patrick!

09:11.084 --> 09:13.126
- What do you think you're doing?
- A tad more.

09:13.834 --> 09:15.334
I'm asking the same thing. He's nuts.

09:15.417 --> 09:19.334
Driving's not allowed here, but you may
have a problem reading Swedish signs, eh?

09:19.417 --> 09:21.209
Are you blind?
Am I the one who's driving?

09:21.626 --> 09:24.417
Hi. How nice to meet you. I'm Patrick.

09:24.751 --> 09:26.876
You can be called Mickey Mouse
for all I care,

09:26.959 --> 09:28.876
but if you want to reverse,
you have to...

09:28.959 --> 09:31.751
...turn the wheel the other way
and look in the mirrors.

09:33.751 --> 09:36.501
- What's she saying?
- No idea. It's Persian.

09:37.251 --> 09:38.876
Beautiful though, isn't it?

09:40.417 --> 09:41.417
No...

09:41.876 --> 09:43.084
No! Hey!

09:43.167 --> 09:45.292
No! No, no!

09:45.376 --> 09:48.084
- I didn't hit anything, did I?
- Get out. Now!

09:48.501 --> 09:50.584
Go and stand somewhere
where you're not in the way.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.167
Remember...

09:54.251 --> 09:57.001
Thanks, but I for one know how to drive.

10:03.251 --> 10:06.959
- What's that?
- That's the radar. For the reversing camera.

10:07.042 --> 10:08.959
Camera? What damn camera?

10:09.834 --> 10:11.626
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.209
Mom!

10:23.084 --> 10:25.126
Reversing cameras and radar...

10:25.584 --> 10:27.959
You shouldn't even be allowed
to reverse a decision.

10:46.501 --> 10:51.251
- My God, what a surprise!
- How nice!

11:00.417 --> 11:02.042
Petter!

11:02.126 --> 11:03.709
Idiots.

11:04.042 --> 11:06.584
Shit, I can't find my jacket.
Are you off?

11:06.667 --> 11:09.376
Petter! Petter!

11:09.459 --> 11:10.917
Yes!

11:11.001 --> 11:13.501
Come here! Petter!

11:13.584 --> 11:15.084
What do you want?

11:25.626 --> 11:28.417
Absolutely no parking!

11:38.251 --> 11:39.417
Clear off!

12:16.417 --> 12:18.751
You took my bike.
Can I have it back, please?

12:21.209 --> 12:23.876
- Wasn't it a ladies bike?
- It's my girlfriend's.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.626
Okay, and where does she live?

12:26.626 --> 12:27.667
In number 152.

12:27.751 --> 12:30.126
With the Commies
who got us sorting our waste?

12:30.209 --> 12:32.084
If so, let her pick it up herself.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.268
- What the... Can you just...
- Never mind.

12:34.292 --> 12:37.209
- Should I just let him take my bike?
- Well... he's just weird.

12:43.417 --> 12:44.792
Hi, Ove!

12:45.292 --> 12:46.542
Alright?

12:47.459 --> 12:49.709
Why does everyone keep asking
if things are alright?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.251
Why would things not be alright?

12:51.334 --> 12:53.501
Well, I mean, you're not at work.

12:54.459 --> 12:56.727
It's in the middle of the day,
and you've never been ill, ever.

12:56.751 --> 13:00.209
Did you want anything other
than simply to waste your breath?

13:00.834 --> 13:02.417
Coming for a spot of lunch?

13:04.251 --> 13:05.584
Idiots.

13:08.501 --> 13:11.959
Hey! Damn car maniac!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.417
Driving is strictly forbidden here!

13:17.084 --> 13:19.459
- Did you actually say something?
- Yes.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.542
Driving is strictly forbidden
in this neighborhood.

13:22.042 --> 13:25.167
Oh, really? Gosh. Well, I have a permit.

13:25.251 --> 13:26.917
Like hell you do.

13:27.334 --> 13:28.876
Bye, bye. Let's go.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.209
Clear off!

13:44.501 --> 13:46.167
Is something the matter?

13:46.792 --> 13:49.417
There are parking spaces for visitors.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.001
That's why we decided on them,
unless I'm mistaken.

13:53.084 --> 13:54.893
That was no visitor,
that was from the local council.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.751
They want to put Rune in a home.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.751
Our heating's acting up. You wouldn't
do me a favor and take a look?

14:04.042 --> 14:05.917
No. Use an extra blanket.

14:14.084 --> 14:18.042
I'm sorry I didn't come yesterday
as I'd planned.

14:18.126 --> 14:19.834
I just couldn't make it.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.376
The place is like a damn fairground.

14:23.459 --> 14:26.792
We've got new neighbors opposite.

14:26.876 --> 14:29.917
People nowadays...
It's shocking, really.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.167
They're all incompetent these days.

14:32.251 --> 14:35.501
They can't reverse a trailer,
they can't mend a puncture.

14:35.917 --> 14:40.292
And if you ask them the simplest thing,
then they want to have lunch!

14:41.292 --> 14:46.584
Just imagine, soon everyone in this
country will be busy having lunch!

14:48.834 --> 14:51.251
I'm glad I won't have to live to see it.

14:53.251 --> 14:56.292
And we're being pestered
by a whiteshirt, too.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.209
A complete car maniac.

15:02.209 --> 15:04.626
It's just chaos when you're not there.

15:13.084 --> 15:17.084
But if I hurry now,
I might see you later today.

15:22.959 --> 15:24.417
I miss you.

16:16.876 --> 16:20.667
I'll be damned. Damn...

16:29.709 --> 16:31.417
Yes? What do you want?

16:32.917 --> 16:34.751
We have rice and chicken.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.209
Are you selling rice?

16:36.292 --> 16:39.542
It's just a bit of food as a thank you.

16:39.626 --> 16:42.917
It's Persian food, with saffron.

16:43.417 --> 16:47.251
Parvaneh is a champion cook,
and me, I'm a champion...

16:50.417 --> 16:53.167
We've removed the trailer.
I saw the note.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.667
You're right. It was our fault.

16:56.126 --> 16:59.167
- We just thought you might be hungry...
- No, I'm not hungry.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.917
- Right. Well, then we'll chuck it.
- No, no wasting.

17:02.417 --> 17:05.416
Actually, we were wondering
if you happen to have a ladder?

17:05.501 --> 17:07.501
Of course I have a ladder.

17:07.584 --> 17:09.666
You're required to in this neighborhood.

17:09.751 --> 17:13.251
It's clearly stated in the regulations -
if you've seen them?

17:16.291 --> 17:20.751
So, maybe we could... borrow it?

17:23.584 --> 17:26.959
It feels great to live by an old man who's
always around, if you know what I mean?

17:27.041 --> 17:29.084
- Here. The supports.
- Yes.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.042
And the manual.

17:32.751 --> 17:33.834
There!

17:34.459 --> 17:35.126
Damn.

17:35.209 --> 17:37.417
You don't happen to have a Holland key,
too?

17:37.501 --> 17:39.209
"Allen key."

17:39.292 --> 17:41.667
Nope, "Holland key."

17:41.751 --> 17:46.001
What's it got to do with Holland?
It's made by Allen: "Al-len key."

17:46.084 --> 17:47.542
Let's Google that!

17:51.501 --> 17:55.917
Ove, could you possibly take a look
at our heating -

17:56.251 --> 17:57.959
if I ask you ever so nicely...

17:58.042 --> 18:00.084
Try bleeding the radiators.

18:00.959 --> 18:04.209
- Might that help?
- Hi! Parvaneh.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.834
- My husband Patrick.
- Hi.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.876
- Always nice to meet one's new neighbors.
- Yes.

18:07.959 --> 18:10.042
- I say, this place is great.
- Gorgeous.

18:10.126 --> 18:13.376
Wonderful.
What a paradise for the children.

18:14.292 --> 18:18.167
Oh, my God. Does no one have a job
to go to these days?

18:18.251 --> 18:21.209
Couldn't you help her
with her bleeding radiators?

18:21.292 --> 18:27.001
They're not "bleeding radiators,"
they are radiators that need bleeding.

18:27.792 --> 18:32.167
Rune might have consulted me about
the heating before he did his coup.

18:32.251 --> 18:35.501
- Ove dear, it was no coup...
- A downright coup, that's what it was!

18:35.584 --> 18:38.584
- Did you want that ladder, or what?
- Yes. Yes, yes.

18:42.001 --> 18:43.667
Ove was chairman of the board,

18:43.751 --> 18:46.001
but then everyone voted
for my husband Rune instead.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.209
Parvaneh! Look!

18:48.292 --> 18:51.459
- These would be great for...
- No, not those. They were for Sonja.

18:51.542 --> 18:54.667
- The thing is, she was...
- Shut up, will you! Quiet!

18:55.376 --> 18:59.917
That's enough! Clear off, all of you!

19:00.001 --> 19:02.501
Go home! Clear off!

19:10.751 --> 19:12.584
A "paradise" indeed...

19:56.501 --> 19:57.709
Ove!

20:01.917 --> 20:03.251
Ove!

20:05.084 --> 20:07.084
Could you come and look at something?

20:08.126 --> 20:09.834
What? Did you want me to come?

20:17.084 --> 20:18.501
Ove?

20:21.709 --> 20:23.667
- The shelves turned out great.
- Yes.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.292
How many books have you got?

20:27.876 --> 20:32.292
Well, there are these ones, and the box
in the kitchen, and those in the shed.

20:36.417 --> 20:38.084
I'll build another one.

20:59.459 --> 21:03.542
<i>The brain is said
to work faster when falling,</i>

21:03.626 --> 21:08.334
<i>as if real-time events were perceived
in slow motion.</i>

21:08.417 --> 21:11.084
<i>Quite a lot passed through my brain.</i>

21:11.167 --> 21:14.084
<i>Mainly stuff to do with radiators,
surprisingly.</i>

21:20.376 --> 21:22.042
<i>And with my mom.</i>

21:22.751 --> 21:24.626
<i>She died early.</i>

21:34.417 --> 21:36.959
<i>My dad wasn't the kind who showed grief.</i>

21:37.042 --> 21:38.376
Thank you for coming.

21:38.459 --> 21:39.834
<i>Nor was I.</i>

21:39.917 --> 21:42.167
Well, it's how it is. It's how it is.

21:45.167 --> 21:47.334
<i>One thing is certain, though:</i>

21:47.417 --> 21:51.001
<i>whatever we do in this life,
no one gets out of it alive.</i>

21:51.084 --> 21:52.917
Come on, Ove. Let's go home.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.584
<i>My dad didn't talk much.</i>

22:00.251 --> 22:03.251
<i>He focused mainly on the house,
and on engines.</i>

22:04.417 --> 22:07.834
<i>Probably because neither
of them talked much, either.</i>

22:08.542 --> 22:11.251
Engines can give you wings.

22:11.959 --> 22:16.709
But if you treat them rough,
you'll lose those wings in a blink.

22:17.417 --> 22:19.792
<i>That night, however...
That night, he talked.</i>

22:19.876 --> 22:21.251
- Ove?
- Yup?

22:21.334 --> 22:24.417
Ove, I want you to know
how everything is linked.

22:24.501 --> 22:25.917
And I mean everything.

22:28.667 --> 22:31.084
- On a Saab 92...
- Yes?

22:31.459 --> 22:35.917
- What do the spark plugs do?
- Make the car run.

22:37.251 --> 22:38.417
Exactly.

22:47.251 --> 22:49.042
This, Ove...

22:49.126 --> 22:51.417
This is the life!

22:53.376 --> 22:57.084
No one will ever make a better car
than Saab.

23:09.001 --> 23:11.417
<i>But most of the time,
he said nothing at all.</i>

23:19.834 --> 23:22.834
<i>After school,
I went to Dad's place of work.</i>

23:22.917 --> 23:25.501
- Hi, Dad!
- Hello, Ove!

23:25.584 --> 23:27.251
<i>He said I was safest there.</i>

23:28.167 --> 23:30.251
- Get off the track, Ove!
- What?

23:30.334 --> 23:32.084
Off the track!

23:32.417 --> 23:34.792
- Ove!
- I can't hear you!

23:34.876 --> 23:36.417
Behind you!

23:43.417 --> 23:47.001
<i>I think that was the first time
in my life Dad hugged me.</i>

23:47.084 --> 23:51.001
<i>I don't know, but strangely enough,
it made me think of Mom.</i>

23:51.084 --> 23:54.042
Gosh, you have to be careful!

23:54.126 --> 23:56.251
<i>I think it was the same for him.</i>

24:02.751 --> 24:04.667
<i>A chance not to be missed.</i>

24:10.417 --> 24:13.667
There, there Ove. That's enough.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.751
You need to let go of Dad, now.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.584
<i>Everyone said he was too kind.</i>

24:23.042 --> 24:24.959
<i>How can someone be "too kind"?</i>

24:48.251 --> 24:51.751
<i>I got to know Dad's wonderful coworkers.</i>

24:53.001 --> 24:54.167
Stop!

24:54.251 --> 24:56.376
<i>- One of them was Tom.</i>
- Give it back!

24:56.792 --> 24:59.209
No. I found it.

24:59.292 --> 25:00.917
I'll beat you so bad...

25:01.001 --> 25:04.334
<i>Sometimes, you don't know whether
you're doing the right thing or not,</i>

25:04.417 --> 25:06.376
<i>but you sort of have that feeling.</i>

25:06.459 --> 25:08.626
You little shit.

25:08.709 --> 25:11.501
<i>And sometimes,
that feeling may in some curious way</i>

25:11.584 --> 25:13.667
<i>be directly linked to physical pain.</i>

25:18.084 --> 25:21.459
Finders, keepers. That's the rule.
That's what we've always done.

25:21.542 --> 25:23.709
Ove?

25:25.251 --> 25:28.834
What you do with that wallet
is your choice. You found it.

25:32.876 --> 25:36.001
- I found this on the train.
- Thank you.

25:40.042 --> 25:42.251
Why didn't you tell them about Tom?

25:42.334 --> 25:45.126
Well, we're not the sort
who tell people what others do.

25:46.251 --> 25:48.167
I was going to keep that wallet.

25:48.251 --> 25:51.834
Yes, I know.
But you'd have returned it eventually.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.001
Yes.

25:53.084 --> 25:55.751
Honesty is the best policy, you know.

25:56.251 --> 26:02.084
Sometimes, however,
honesty just needs a little assistance.

26:07.709 --> 26:10.834
- You get it?
- Yes. Great. I get it.

26:17.001 --> 26:18.459
Come on, let's go home.

26:20.792 --> 26:23.167
- From the hip.
<i>- And so the day came</i>

26:23.251 --> 26:27.292
<i>when I was finally going
to get a taste of that great freedom.</i>

26:32.667 --> 26:33.751
Hi, Dad.

26:34.959 --> 26:36.251
Hello, Ove.

26:38.209 --> 26:39.584
How did you do?

26:40.667 --> 26:42.751
Well, here you go. Take a look.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.834
I'll be damned! Look at this.

27:11.751 --> 27:15.709
Hey, take a look at Ove's grades!

27:16.584 --> 27:18.751
He's going to be our next supervisor.

27:32.834 --> 27:36.501
Hey! All A's and B's. Amazing!

27:43.292 --> 27:45.084
Get the Super!

27:45.876 --> 27:47.376
For God's sake, get the Super!

27:51.917 --> 27:53.542
Dad!

28:07.626 --> 28:09.334
What the hell...

28:11.417 --> 28:14.501
What kind of shit do you sell? Hey?

28:14.584 --> 28:17.917
It said "universal usage -
suitable for every need."

28:20.042 --> 28:21.584
What did you use it for?

28:26.292 --> 28:27.459
Idiot!

28:30.001 --> 28:32.917
You can't even find
a decent rope these days.

28:50.751 --> 28:53.834
Those new neighbors are messing around.

28:53.917 --> 28:56.459
They eat rice cooked with saffron.

28:57.084 --> 29:00.001
Well, what's wrong with meat and
potatoes, that's what I want to know.

29:00.084 --> 29:03.167
You don't need
to put Christmas into everything.

29:11.417 --> 29:15.209
Well, I think this must be the first
time you've ever had to wait for me.

29:29.084 --> 29:32.209
- Hey! What do you think you're doing?
- It scratched Prince!

29:35.376 --> 29:38.834
If you throw one more stone,
I'll transform your pug into a door mat.

29:39.251 --> 29:42.834
He's a Chihuahua,
and that cat's probably contagious.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.292
I'm sure, but then again,
I'm sure you are, too.

29:45.376 --> 29:47.584
But we don't throw stones at you, do we?

29:48.834 --> 29:51.167
You still think you own the place
and can do what you want,

29:51.251 --> 29:53.834
don't you, you old bastard.
I'm going to tell Anders.

29:53.917 --> 29:59.376
By all means, if you think you'll get any
understanding from a slick Audi driver.

29:59.459 --> 30:02.042
Four zeros on the bonnet
and a fifth behind the wheel.

30:06.417 --> 30:11.417
If that thing takes another piss on
our slabs, I'll get them wired up.

30:13.667 --> 30:14.959
Idiots.

30:15.667 --> 30:17.126
That goes for you, too!

30:18.334 --> 30:21.001
Clear off! This is private property.

30:48.376 --> 30:50.959
On August 27th, you borrowed my hose.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.876
- I need it back now.
- You do.

30:54.709 --> 30:56.584
Now? Are you watering now? In March?

30:57.626 --> 30:59.334
You mind your flow and I'll mind mine.

31:00.126 --> 31:03.326
Couldn't you please have a look at those
radiators? Now that you're here, anyway.

31:04.417 --> 31:06.417
Thanks, that's really kind.

31:07.167 --> 31:11.084
- I've got some food on - you don't want...
- Thanks, but I have eaten.

31:12.542 --> 31:15.167
I see. Well,
then I'll just go and get the hose.

31:21.417 --> 31:22.751
Rune?

31:24.459 --> 31:25.626
Rune!

31:27.126 --> 31:28.209
Hey?

31:35.626 --> 31:40.792
People are starting to do whatever
they feel like in this association.

31:42.792 --> 31:46.084
Everything we built,
you and I, they'll tear down.

31:47.209 --> 31:51.542
But I don't give a damn.
I couldn't care less.

31:54.584 --> 31:58.126
You see, I'm going to leave this place.
For good.

32:00.292 --> 32:02.251
I'm joining Sonja.

32:04.501 --> 32:06.959
I thought you'd be happy to know that,

32:07.667 --> 32:09.917
since you can't do anything about it.

32:10.876 --> 32:13.334
All you can do is sit here
and watch when it all goes...

32:13.417 --> 32:14.709
Come on in.

32:16.084 --> 32:17.501
Thanks for the loan.

32:18.084 --> 32:20.001
And this was really good of you.

32:20.626 --> 32:22.709
- Sure you don't want a bite, after all?
- Nope.

32:22.792 --> 32:24.167
Jimmy's eating, too.

32:24.251 --> 32:26.084
Stuffed cabbage leaves, Ove. Awesome.

32:26.459 --> 32:28.709
I'm sure Rune would have loved them.

32:29.459 --> 32:31.667
Well, he neither hears
nor understands a thing.

32:31.751 --> 32:35.126
Of course he does.
Rune knows a lot more than you think.

32:35.209 --> 32:38.501
It's as if he knows exactly
what goes on inside our heads.

32:44.334 --> 32:46.001
Oh well, I have to leave.

32:48.501 --> 32:49.917
Let go.

32:51.917 --> 32:53.459
Let go of the hose!

33:04.251 --> 33:05.626
Hi, Ove!

33:06.209 --> 33:07.709
We're trying to open the window.

33:07.792 --> 33:10.209
From the outside? Good luck.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.876
You're holding the ladder, aren't you?

33:20.417 --> 33:22.584
- You were supposed to hold that ladder.
- Yeah, yeah!

33:22.667 --> 33:24.209
Now where are you off to?

33:29.167 --> 33:31.042
Thank you, it was very tasty! Ove

33:33.959 --> 33:36.459
You can trust a Saab, that's for sure.

35:06.751 --> 35:08.417
The Manager will see you now.

35:12.584 --> 35:14.167
This was very sad. I'm so sorry.

35:16.626 --> 35:21.001
If there's anything we can do, we will.
You just have to say. Here.

35:21.459 --> 35:23.084
They were very good, your grades.

35:24.917 --> 35:28.542
This is yours.
That's half Dad's salary for this month.

35:29.334 --> 35:32.167
You always paid him in advance.

35:33.876 --> 35:35.834
No, we can't take that.

35:35.917 --> 35:37.501
It's only right.

35:38.876 --> 35:40.276
Maybe we can find another solution?

35:44.126 --> 35:47.667
<i>I knew how to do the job,
so it was kind of a given.</i>

35:48.042 --> 35:50.667
<i>And besides,
I already knew all Dad's colleagues...</i>

35:50.751 --> 35:53.584
So, what now? Now Daddy's in heaven.

36:00.376 --> 36:02.251
No, not that. Not that!

36:03.417 --> 36:04.584
Not that!

36:05.126 --> 36:10.001
<i>There comes a time in everyone's life
when you decide who you want to be.</i>

36:10.084 --> 36:13.667
That's for the wallet. Quits at last.
Asshole.

36:13.751 --> 36:16.292
<i>I think that's when my time came.</i>

36:19.209 --> 36:22.042
This is my watch.
And yes - now we're quits!

36:40.251 --> 36:42.251
Are you Ove Lindahl?

36:43.334 --> 36:44.334
Yes.

36:44.751 --> 36:46.501
We've been looking for you.

36:46.584 --> 36:47.584
Oh?

36:49.084 --> 36:51.209
We want a look at your house.

36:52.376 --> 36:55.334
There are new building plans
for this area.

36:55.417 --> 36:59.584
This house doesn't live up
to modern building requirements.

37:00.126 --> 37:03.167
No, Stig,
I think we'll have to tear it all down.

37:03.251 --> 37:04.001
Yes.

37:04.084 --> 37:06.584
Well, as you can see,
it's ready for the tip.

37:07.084 --> 37:09.459
<i>I think that was the first time
I came across them,</i>

37:09.542 --> 37:11.667
<i>but it wouldn't be the last.</i>

37:11.751 --> 37:14.751
<i>They never told me their names.
They only said where they were from,</i>

37:15.084 --> 37:17.667
<i>those men with their white shirts.</i>

37:20.584 --> 37:22.751
<i>And they always got their way.</i>

37:25.251 --> 37:27.084
Ove! Time for a break!

37:27.167 --> 37:29.209
<i>At last, it was done.</i>

37:29.292 --> 37:32.084
<i>And looking pretty good,
though I say it myself.</i>

37:32.167 --> 37:35.417
<i>But of course
the whiteshirts didn't agree.</i>

37:38.584 --> 37:39.751
Hello.

37:41.376 --> 37:46.001
<i>If what they say is true, that fate is
the sum total of our own stupidity,</i>

37:46.709 --> 37:49.876
<i>then I think
what altered my fate was a result</i>

37:49.959 --> 37:53.084
<i>of the stupidity of my neighbors.</i>

38:03.292 --> 38:04.917
Is there anyone still in there?

38:05.792 --> 38:07.084
Is there anyone in there?

38:09.917 --> 38:12.542
Hello? Hello!

38:12.626 --> 38:15.584
Help!

38:57.417 --> 38:59.501
- Connect the hose up!
- I'm going in!

38:59.584 --> 39:02.542
<i>At first, I tried to reason nicely
with the firemen...</i>

39:03.376 --> 39:04.876
<i>but then he arrived.</i>

39:04.959 --> 39:08.917
Turn it off. Turn the water off.
It's being demolished anyway.

39:09.584 --> 39:11.667
Stop putting it out!

39:11.751 --> 39:12.834
<i>The whiteshirt.</i>

40:34.584 --> 40:36.251
How long have we been traveling?

40:37.001 --> 40:38.876
About an hour. Why?

40:38.959 --> 40:40.167
Darn!

40:40.251 --> 40:43.417
I could have woken you up,
if I'd known you had to get off...

40:43.792 --> 40:46.001
but you were sleeping so sweetly.

40:46.709 --> 40:48.334
Have you overslept now?

40:48.417 --> 40:51.126
No, it's no problem.

40:52.167 --> 40:53.334
Tickets, please.

41:00.376 --> 41:01.376
Thank you.

41:02.459 --> 41:04.167
Well, I don't have a ticket.

41:04.709 --> 41:06.376
Oh. Then you'll have to buy a ticket.

41:07.792 --> 41:10.751
I'm sorry,
but I haven't got any money either.

41:10.834 --> 41:12.084
I'll get it.

41:13.751 --> 41:14.792
There.

41:19.667 --> 41:21.709
I will definitely be paying you back.

41:22.792 --> 41:24.001
Don't worry about that, now.

41:28.001 --> 41:29.917
I'm reading <i>The Master and Margarita.</i>

41:30.917 --> 41:33.001
- Do you know it?
- No.

41:33.084 --> 41:36.876
In that book,
there's a fare-dodging cat.

41:38.751 --> 41:41.167
Have you read anything
by Mikhail Bulgakov?

41:41.917 --> 41:43.876
No, I've read nothing by 'im.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.501
"By him."

41:48.501 --> 41:49.542
Oh.

41:50.167 --> 41:52.126
I'm studying to be a teacher.

41:52.209 --> 41:53.584
And I'm getting off here.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.917
Wait! You forgot this.

42:36.084 --> 42:39.792
<i>After that, I got up
and took the 6:30 train every morning.</i>

42:43.542 --> 42:45.334
<i>But she was nowhere to be seen.</i>

42:50.417 --> 42:52.459
<i>After three weeks, I almost gave up.</i>

43:06.251 --> 43:07.501
Hello.

43:07.834 --> 43:09.042
Hello.

43:15.376 --> 43:17.209
Do you often take this train?

43:18.167 --> 43:19.376
Yes.

43:20.376 --> 43:23.417
I... I'm doing my military service.

43:24.292 --> 43:27.584
In the regiment.

43:30.542 --> 43:35.917
Well... I was thinking
you should have your money back.

43:39.584 --> 43:42.376
Wouldn't it be nicer
if you invited me to dinner?

43:44.959 --> 43:46.834
Dinner? Sure.

43:50.542 --> 43:54.834
I... I don't really have anywhere
to cook dinner.

43:56.417 --> 43:57.876
In a restaurant.

44:00.876 --> 44:02.584
Oh? Okay.

44:06.084 --> 44:08.751
- If you go to restaurants?
- Indeed.

44:11.126 --> 44:12.501
That's settled, then.

44:12.917 --> 44:14.251
Definitely.

44:46.459 --> 44:48.834
- Hello! Hello.
- Hi.

44:49.626 --> 44:51.667
You're 15 minutes late.

44:51.751 --> 44:53.751
Oh? Am I?

45:35.584 --> 45:37.251
Do you know anything about cars?

45:38.417 --> 45:39.501
About cars?

45:39.584 --> 45:45.751
It might be interesting to know how
it's possible for them to go forwards?

45:46.917 --> 45:49.667
It's not as easy as you might think.

45:49.751 --> 45:51.001
It isn't?

45:51.084 --> 45:56.667
Imagine a car... Let's say a Saab 9-3.

45:56.751 --> 45:59.334
You need a driving force. An engine.

45:59.417 --> 46:01.917
And Saab uses piston engines.

46:02.001 --> 46:05.751
And the piston drives a connecting rod.

46:06.334 --> 46:09.792
The great thing with Saabs is
that they're a front-wheel drive...

46:09.876 --> 46:11.917
So they need no propeller shaft.

46:13.917 --> 46:15.542
My dad also tinkers with cars.

46:26.834 --> 46:30.042
- You have hardly had anything to eat.
- No. I ate at home.

46:32.251 --> 46:35.751
Oh? Why did you eat at home?

46:41.751 --> 46:46.001
So that you could order
whatever you wanted.

46:46.959 --> 46:48.584
I've lied to you.

46:49.626 --> 46:52.917
I'm not doing military service.
I clean trains.

46:54.084 --> 46:55.751
And my house has burnt to the ground.

46:56.584 --> 46:58.126
And I need to go now.

47:00.126 --> 47:01.917
Thanks. It's been very nice.

47:16.501 --> 47:18.334
<i>She asked what I was interested in.</i>

47:19.251 --> 47:23.751
<i>I replied "houses,"
because that's all I could think of.</i>

47:24.167 --> 47:26.667
<i>Then she told me about a course.</i>

47:27.251 --> 47:29.917
<i>Two years later, I was an engineer.</i>

47:32.792 --> 47:34.709
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

47:36.959 --> 47:38.834
Gosh, these are nice.

47:38.917 --> 47:40.584
- Very stylish.
- Nice, eh?

47:43.459 --> 47:47.709
Right. Let's see what your diploma says.

47:47.792 --> 47:49.917
Do you want to marry me?

47:50.709 --> 47:54.667
I was thinking...
you might want us to...

47:57.084 --> 47:59.126
Now, do it calmly and clearly...

48:02.834 --> 48:04.834
Do you want to marry me?

48:04.917 --> 48:06.334
Yes!

48:06.417 --> 48:08.042
- What?
- Yes, I do!

48:29.209 --> 48:30.667
Yes! Yes!

48:32.751 --> 48:37.126
Ouch! Fucking hell! Shit!

48:37.209 --> 48:40.251
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

48:41.209 --> 48:43.917
Shit, you have to take me
to the hospital straightaway.

48:44.501 --> 48:46.376
- Because of a bleeding nose?
- Hell, Ove!

48:46.459 --> 48:48.334
Patrick has fallen off the ladder.

48:48.417 --> 48:51.917
I see. Well, I could have
worked that out with my ass.

48:53.417 --> 48:55.459
You drive.

48:55.542 --> 48:58.667
Use that little sewing machine
you arrived in the other day.

48:58.751 --> 49:00.376
But I don't have a license!

49:00.459 --> 49:02.626
- And you are how old?
- Thirty.

49:02.709 --> 49:04.667
Thirty years old and no driving license!

49:04.751 --> 49:06.893
Patrick has gone ahead
in an ambulance and might be dying,

49:06.917 --> 49:08.626
but sure, I'll go by bus.
Thanks a bunch!

49:08.709 --> 49:10.042
Alright, I'll take you.

49:10.126 --> 49:11.834
Thanks! At last! Was that so hard?

49:13.167 --> 49:15.834
- So where are you going now, then?
- To fetch the children.

49:19.959 --> 49:21.751
It smells yucky.

49:23.126 --> 49:25.584
Mom, I can't breathe.

49:26.084 --> 49:29.209
- Roll the windows down, then.
- No, not the windows.

49:29.292 --> 49:30.542
Up, down, up...

49:30.626 --> 49:33.042
Roll them up! Roll them up.

49:34.334 --> 49:35.584
Stop it!

49:36.084 --> 49:37.917
Can't you go any faster?

49:39.251 --> 49:42.626
Please, Ove. No one issues parking
tickets at a hospital, now, do they?

49:45.501 --> 49:47.084
It'll only take 15 minutes.

49:50.251 --> 49:53.042
Alright, he's under observation,
so I'm allowed in now.

49:53.126 --> 49:54.560
I'll see you back here afterwards. Okay?

49:54.584 --> 49:56.334
Hang on a moment.
What about the children?

49:57.334 --> 49:58.417
Well, they're with you.

50:01.876 --> 50:03.084
Hey!

50:09.084 --> 50:11.417
- Book.
- Yes, I'm not blind.

50:11.501 --> 50:14.167
- Book!
- She wants you to read it.

50:28.667 --> 50:32.501
"Mister Bear has just started doing
what he does every Tuesday.

50:32.584 --> 50:35.542
'You want to drive trains
when you grow up, though, don't you?'

50:35.626 --> 50:36.834
says Ivor."

50:36.917 --> 50:38.709
Book not much fun.

50:38.792 --> 50:41.334
No, I quite agree.

50:41.417 --> 50:45.876
You have to read properly.
You have to talk like a bear talks.

50:45.959 --> 50:49.084
- Bears don't talk.
- This one does.

51:00.209 --> 51:05.084
"'I've already been a train driver
a long time,' says Mister Bear."

51:05.167 --> 51:07.376
Yes, just like that. That's great!

51:07.459 --> 51:09.876
"Mister Bear presses a red button."

51:17.001 --> 51:19.334
"One hundred hot honey bees..."

51:19.417 --> 51:21.667
- Hi, kids!
- Look, a clown!

51:21.751 --> 51:23.792
Beppo the Clown has arrived.

51:25.334 --> 51:27.667
Do you want to see a magic trick?

51:27.751 --> 51:30.292
I was actually reading
to these children.

51:30.376 --> 51:32.417
"He was actually reading
to these children."

51:32.876 --> 51:36.084
Well, I'm here now. Have you got a coin?

51:37.417 --> 51:39.251
I need a coin for my trick.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.501
Please give him a coin.

51:46.917 --> 51:49.501
Thanks. Here we go!

51:57.251 --> 51:59.126
So please tell us where you live.

52:01.084 --> 52:04.124
- How could you just leave my children?
- I haven't left any children at all.

52:04.459 --> 52:09.209
Ask these imbecile "policemen"
in fancy dress. They made me.

52:09.292 --> 52:12.751
According to our guidelines, we judged
your dad to be a security hazard.

52:12.834 --> 52:16.084
I only wanted my coin back. How many
times do I have to tell you that?

52:20.584 --> 52:24.626
Wow! Magic!
Beppo the Clown says bye-bye.

52:28.501 --> 52:30.584
Hey, hang on a minute!

52:30.667 --> 52:33.667
This isn't the same coin I gave you.

52:33.751 --> 52:35.001
Poor kids.

52:35.084 --> 52:36.834
I want my coin. You...

52:36.917 --> 52:38.042
Shit!

52:38.917 --> 52:40.167
Ouch!

52:40.834 --> 52:42.751
Are you totally mad?

52:43.251 --> 52:45.542
Hey there,
what do you think you are doing?

52:45.626 --> 52:47.751
Am I to blame for his long shoes?

52:48.084 --> 52:52.084
That's not even funny.
Impractical is all.

52:53.417 --> 52:55.792
Shit! This is unbelievable!

52:56.251 --> 52:59.001
Oh well, what did I say?

52:59.417 --> 53:01.084
I'll get it. It's my fault.

53:01.751 --> 53:02.834
It's my car.

53:06.667 --> 53:07.834
Bye, Ove.

53:07.917 --> 53:10.709
Bye-bye, Ove!

54:27.501 --> 54:30.251
Come and give me a hand, goddammit!

54:34.751 --> 54:36.501
Hell, are you insane?

54:36.584 --> 54:39.751
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand now!

54:44.126 --> 54:45.667
Dad!

54:54.917 --> 54:56.834
What's wrong with you? Shit!

54:56.917 --> 54:58.542
Do you want to die or something?

54:58.626 --> 55:00.667
You saved 'im.

55:00.751 --> 55:03.626
Him. It's "You saved him."

55:14.584 --> 55:15.751
Ove!

55:16.459 --> 55:18.001
Nasanin did a drawing for you.

55:19.584 --> 55:20.917
Wait there!

55:24.251 --> 55:27.459
Here you go.
Nasanin did this drawing for you.

55:27.542 --> 55:31.501
The one in color is you.
She always does you in color.

55:31.584 --> 55:34.501
- What do you mean "always"?
- Listen, I've got this great idea.

55:35.084 --> 55:36.834
You're going
to be my driving instructor.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.435
Patrick can't do it now, and you're
so much better than him anyway.

55:39.459 --> 55:42.459
- No, I haven't got the time.
- I'll pay the gas of course.

55:42.542 --> 55:44.209
Isn't it a great idea?

55:44.709 --> 55:45.876
What was that?

55:54.376 --> 55:56.376
Oh, no! Poor thing!

55:59.376 --> 56:02.917
What? Oh dear...

56:06.417 --> 56:08.792
- Open up.
- Not into my house.

56:08.876 --> 56:10.251
Open the damn door!

56:17.667 --> 56:20.334
Shit, it's really cold in here.
Get me a blanket.

56:20.417 --> 56:22.376
- Why?
- Quickly! Now!

57:07.751 --> 57:10.834
Hi! I was just outside
and heard someone shouting.

57:11.876 --> 57:14.001
I know something quicker. Hang on...

57:15.292 --> 57:18.412
You can say what you want about us fatties,
but we are great at heat retention.

57:18.459 --> 57:19.792
I'll get something to wipe with.

57:19.876 --> 57:22.084
No, no, no! Not into the kitchen!

57:22.834 --> 57:26.042
What's this? Shit, it's so low.

57:26.626 --> 57:30.167
That's for Sonja. My wife.

57:30.251 --> 57:31.626
Okay. Where is she?

57:31.709 --> 57:34.584
She's... dead.

57:35.792 --> 57:39.251
She was an amazing cook, though.
I used to eat here all the time.

57:39.334 --> 57:40.501
Didn't I, Ove?

57:42.834 --> 57:44.751
Well, she seems to feel a little better.

57:45.459 --> 57:47.084
Who's having her?

57:47.167 --> 57:49.417
I can't.
My children are incredibly allergic.

57:49.959 --> 57:53.501
Shit, I forgot. I'm allergic, too.

58:03.167 --> 58:05.959
Killing oneself isn't all that easy,
you know.

58:07.751 --> 58:10.126
And now she's moved in as well.

58:11.084 --> 58:14.751
So now I've got to get rid
of her and then, I'm coming.

58:14.834 --> 58:16.417
I promise you, Sonja.

58:18.126 --> 58:22.251
She looked like this when I got her,
so don't think it's my fault.

58:23.167 --> 58:24.709
See you soon.

58:51.251 --> 58:53.001
I didn't think you liked children.

58:53.084 --> 58:55.501
Of course I like children.

58:55.959 --> 58:58.709
I just don't know if I'd be a good dad.

59:08.167 --> 59:12.542
You'd be the best dad
our children could ever have.

59:14.542 --> 59:16.001
I promise.

59:30.417 --> 59:33.001
Hey! Idiot!

59:33.959 --> 59:37.209
Shit! Sorry, Ove! Did I hit you?

59:37.751 --> 59:40.709
- I've got Anders to teach me to drive now.
- Hi there, Ove!

59:40.792 --> 59:43.584
That slick so-and-so. I thought
you wanted to learn how to drive?

59:44.584 --> 59:46.376
Well, you didn't want to help me.

59:46.751 --> 59:51.042
- The belt might be a good idea after all.
- Oh, yes!

59:51.126 --> 59:54.376
Oops. I accidentally bumped... Sorry.

59:54.459 --> 59:55.584
Bye!

01:00:35.084 --> 01:00:36.292
Hello!

01:00:36.376 --> 01:00:38.459
Ouch! Be careful!

01:00:38.542 --> 01:00:41.376
Please be careful with Dad's leg.

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:46.167
Oops. Are you alright?

01:00:51.126 --> 01:00:52.667
I'll get her if you get the door.

01:00:52.751 --> 01:00:54.584
There we are. Sit here.

01:00:59.792 --> 01:01:03.167
Have you got them training plates, then?
You need those on the back of the car.

01:01:04.001 --> 01:01:06.334
It's the law for learners.

01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:10.584
I simply can't watch one idiot
teach another one how to drive.

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:13.001
Thanks!

01:01:14.459 --> 01:01:16.084
Hello there, Ove! Alright?

01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:18.917
Manuals are for reading,
in case you didn't know.

01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:28.584
Hi! Great weather for driving practice,
isn't it?

01:01:30.084 --> 01:01:32.084
Here you go.
I've made some Persian cookies.

01:01:32.542 --> 01:01:34.751
I almost sort of know how to drive.

01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:39.709
Sit down.

01:01:46.751 --> 01:01:48.251
Stop. That's amber.

01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:50.876
Really, I suck.

01:01:55.001 --> 01:01:57.292
It's green now, so you can go.

01:01:57.376 --> 01:01:59.334
Easy does it. Match with the throttle...

01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:01.457
- God, he's really stressing me out!
- It's as if...

01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:05.417
Start it up again. Release the key.
Release the key.

01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:08.334
When the clutch goes up,
the throttle goes down.

01:02:08.417 --> 01:02:10.876
- That's what I'm doing!
- Let the clutch... No...

01:02:14.084 --> 01:02:15.876
No, I just can't do it!

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.501
I'll be damned!

01:02:25.292 --> 01:02:28.292
Hey, have you never been a beginner? Eh?
Can't you see the plates?

01:02:28.376 --> 01:02:32.042
- Easy does it, old man.
- "Old man"?

01:02:32.126 --> 01:02:36.084
I'm not your old man, asshole!

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:37.917
I'm "angry man"!

01:02:39.167 --> 01:02:42.751
If you honk again,
that's the last thing you do.

01:02:42.834 --> 01:02:45.084
Get it? Eh? Get it?

01:02:57.209 --> 01:02:59.042
Now I want you to listen to me.

01:02:59.584 --> 01:03:02.626
You've given birth twice.
Three times, soon.

01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:07.584
You've come all the way from Iran,
fleeing war and all kinds of hell.

01:03:07.667 --> 01:03:11.001
You've learned a new language,
got an education and a job -

01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:12.417
and you've married a loser.

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:16.084
So you'll have no problems
learning how to drive.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.834
I mean,
we're not talking brain surgery here.

01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:22.459
There. Just start the car and drive off.

01:03:26.792 --> 01:03:28.334
Idiot!

01:03:30.084 --> 01:03:31.417
Great.

01:03:40.042 --> 01:03:42.709
No, no, no.
I've already got what we want.

01:03:45.084 --> 01:03:47.584
No, no, no, no. Over here.

01:04:01.917 --> 01:04:05.709
This was Sonja's favorite cafe.

01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:10.292
Every Saturday at one, we'd sit here.

01:04:11.876 --> 01:04:13.042
At this very table.

01:04:13.126 --> 01:04:15.042
Eating Napoleon slices?

01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:21.834
- How did you know?
- It's Saturday, and it's one o'clock.

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:31.917
Then what did you do?

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:36.709
At two, we went home.

01:04:37.751 --> 01:04:42.334
Sonja used to read,
and me and Rune washed our cars.

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:46.209
By hand, that was.
No damn scratchy car-washes for us.

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:47.709
Rune?

01:04:50.167 --> 01:04:52.667
But you don't even talk to one another.

01:04:53.917 --> 01:04:55.751
Well, we used to, in those days.

01:05:04.292 --> 01:05:06.584
I think we were pretty similar, really.

01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:14.417
Stop!

01:05:14.917 --> 01:05:16.334
- I said stop!
- Hey!

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:20.751
- Rune.
- Ove.

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.876
<i>We worked well together
right from the start.</i>

01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:24.917
I'll cut across the field.

01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:26.751
Alright!

01:05:27.001 --> 01:05:30.167
- Don't let it happen again.
- No, and tell your friends that, too.

01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:32.501
<i>We shared the same sound ideals,</i>

01:05:32.584 --> 01:05:37.001
<i>and at the first community meeting,
I was elected chairman and Rune deputy.</i>

01:05:37.084 --> 01:05:38.251
KEEP GATE CLOSED!

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:39.477
BALL GAMES STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

01:05:39.501 --> 01:05:40.917
<i>Very sensible, if you asked us.</i>

01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:42.417
NO BIKE PARKING

01:05:42.834 --> 01:05:46.334
<i>I think we were both surprised
to have found a friend.</i>

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:48.167
Well, I just need to park.

01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:52.334
<i>Until we discovered
that tiny difference between us...</i>

01:05:52.417 --> 01:05:54.084
You drive a Volvo?

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:56.584
Yes.

01:05:58.626 --> 01:06:00.167
What do you drive?

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:02.917
A Saab.

01:06:04.834 --> 01:06:05.667
Oh.

01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:08.709
<i>Initially, we tried to disregard this</i>

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:11.709
<i>and socialized like regular couples.</i>

01:06:11.792 --> 01:06:14.001
<i>It was fine as long
as we made the effort.</i>

01:06:14.084 --> 01:06:15.584
It was a boy!

01:06:32.542 --> 01:06:34.376
<i>And the years passed...</i>

01:06:35.751 --> 01:06:38.084
<i>We sort of lost touch...</i>

01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:46.292
<i>But then, without any prior notice,
that bastard did his board coup.</i>

01:06:47.001 --> 01:06:51.876
It made me so mad I went straight
and bought a Saab 9000.

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:53.209
CS.

01:06:55.334 --> 01:07:00.167
<i>And Rune went for a Volvo 960-
Executive.</i>

01:07:00.251 --> 01:07:06.167
<i>In the end, their boy grew up and suddenly
decided to move all the way to the US.</i>

01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:08.251
<i>I don't think they saw him much after.</i>

01:07:09.084 --> 01:07:12.501
<i>I'd just been to look at the
new Saab 9-5,</i>

01:07:12.584 --> 01:07:14.334
<i>when at last I thought:</i>

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:19.376
<i>"Time to bury the hatchet. Time to
start talking to one another again."</i>

01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:21.667
I've been thinking...

01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:27.584
Isn't it time for us
to bury the past and move on?

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:35.917
Of course we're friends.

01:07:37.959 --> 01:07:39.876
<i>That's when it happened.</i>

01:07:39.959 --> 01:07:41.834
Do you want to see my new car?

01:07:45.084 --> 01:07:46.626
<i>A BMW.</i>

01:07:47.001 --> 01:07:48.917
<i>I turned around and went home.</i>

01:07:49.584 --> 01:07:51.334
<i>Rune had given up. Totally.</i>

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:54.209
Hey! I can't drive a Volvo all my life.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:58.126
The final betrayal.

01:07:59.917 --> 01:08:02.584
Did you never have children?

01:08:10.292 --> 01:08:11.542
It's two o'clock.

01:08:13.959 --> 01:08:17.376
Ove, I need to learn
the highway code as well.

01:08:18.167 --> 01:08:19.792
Can you help me out?

01:08:21.084 --> 01:08:22.542
Oh...

01:08:23.084 --> 01:08:25.501
Well, I suppose
that's part of getting a license.

01:08:25.584 --> 01:08:28.167
Thank you so much.
It'll be fine, I promise.

01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:29.876
I mean, you already know them.

01:08:31.626 --> 01:08:32.876
What?

01:08:33.417 --> 01:08:34.626
Well, the children.

01:08:36.626 --> 01:08:40.834
- I don't think this is a very good idea.
- No, I agree. Nor do I.

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:44.126
- Maybe I should stay at home?
- No, why should you? This is a great idea.

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:49.584
Call me anytime.

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:51.751
Bye!

01:08:56.834 --> 01:09:00.417
I'm hungry. I'm hungry!

01:09:02.084 --> 01:09:04.084
You're against cruel animal testing,

01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:06.751
but you're quite happy
with cruel child testing.

01:09:08.334 --> 01:09:10.751
Nasanin wants a bottle
before we go to bed,

01:09:10.834 --> 01:09:15.709
and you have to wash the bottle by hand,
because Dad can't install the dishwasher.

01:09:15.792 --> 01:09:18.334
He calls it
a "goddamn useless dishwasher

01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:21.751
that's going out the window
one of these days."

01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:23.667
Come, and I'll show you my room.

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:31.834
What do you think is important
to consider when building a house?

01:09:33.084 --> 01:09:35.334
Well, water.

01:09:36.376 --> 01:09:37.834
And drainage.

01:09:38.376 --> 01:09:41.084
Exactly. And the infrastructure.

01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:42.209
Naturally.

01:09:42.292 --> 01:09:44.001
Have you built houses before?

01:09:44.084 --> 01:09:46.542
Yes, but not from bricks.

01:09:46.626 --> 01:09:50.001
Go on, I was top of the class!
It's true.

01:09:53.251 --> 01:09:54.709
Had you agreed on this?

01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:00.376
No.

01:10:00.876 --> 01:10:02.251
I'm totally...

01:10:06.751 --> 01:10:09.042
- Sepideh?
- Hi, Mom!

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:14.376
She's asleep.

01:10:32.417 --> 01:10:33.792
Drat. What's this?

01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:41.917
Hey, what are you doing? Oh. It's you.

01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:48.251
Regarding that ladies bike, the sign
says "Strictly no bike parking."

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:50.417
Isn't this where Sonja use to live?

01:10:51.584 --> 01:10:54.667
I was her pupil.
I could neither read nor write,

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:57.584
but she was the only one
who didn't pass me off as stupid.

01:10:57.667 --> 01:10:59.751
I learned everything then.
She was amazing.

01:11:00.126 --> 01:11:01.751
Sorry to have bothered you.

01:11:05.667 --> 01:11:06.876
Hey!

01:11:09.251 --> 01:11:12.001
- What's that bike to you?
- I was mending it for my girl.

01:11:12.084 --> 01:11:15.501
Well, she isn't my girl yet,
but I hoped she would be if I mended it.

01:11:16.251 --> 01:11:18.435
- I need to go to my other job now.
- You have two jobs?

01:11:18.459 --> 01:11:21.042
In a kebab shop. I'm saving for
a car I've been told I can buy.

01:11:21.126 --> 01:11:23.209
- What car's that?
- A Renault.

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:26.542
A French one?
Are you buying a French car?

01:11:28.626 --> 01:11:31.334
And then,
an old pupil of yours turned up as well.

01:11:32.126 --> 01:11:35.001
And now I just need to fix something
before I join you.

01:11:35.084 --> 01:11:37.584
That's all there is to it.

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:57.834
DRIVER TRAINEE

01:11:57.917 --> 01:12:00.084
Go!

01:12:05.084 --> 01:12:06.917
Well done. Switch the engine off.

01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:09.709
Now you know how to park as well.

01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:12.393
What do you mean, "well done"?
I just bumped into a car.

01:12:12.417 --> 01:12:14.209
So what?

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.376
It was just a Volvo.

01:12:16.751 --> 01:12:19.376
Wait here. I need to do something.

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:39.376
So, that bike's been repaired.
You can return it to that girl now.

01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:42.917
- Did you fix it?
- I just need to unload it.

01:12:43.584 --> 01:12:46.376
- Do you eat kebab?
- No. Why would I do that?

01:12:49.001 --> 01:12:50.876
What's he doing here?

01:12:50.959 --> 01:12:53.584
- Why are your eyes sooty?
- That's makeup.

01:12:53.959 --> 01:12:56.959
- I thought that was for girls.
- He thinks it makes him look good.

01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:01.584
- It won't get you a girl, you know.
- I might not want a girl.

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:04.501
- Are you gay?
- Ove, that's no way to talk!

01:13:04.584 --> 01:13:06.810
- He can say whatever he wants.
- Alright. Are you one of those?

01:13:06.834 --> 01:13:09.251
One of those gays?

01:13:14.167 --> 01:13:17.667
Yes, I'm one of those.
I'm one of those gays.

01:13:17.751 --> 01:13:20.417
Alright.
What are you shouting about, then?

01:13:21.584 --> 01:13:23.834
You won't say anything about Mirsad,
will you?

01:13:23.917 --> 01:13:26.417
That was his dad who just arrived,
and he doesn't know.

01:13:26.501 --> 01:13:30.917
I'm not the kind of person who runs
around telling people what others do.

01:13:32.459 --> 01:13:35.167
Besides, you have much more
pressing things to worry about.

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:38.459
- I do?
- Buying a French car...

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:44.084
It might be good
to know what makes it go forwards.

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:46.876
It's not as easy as you might think.

01:13:47.376 --> 01:13:49.501
I really, really need a pee.

01:13:49.834 --> 01:13:51.685
I see. But we were going
to go through the engine.

01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:53.751
I'm sorry, but I can't. I'll be quick.

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:09.007
- Hello! You must be Ove, aren't you?
- You're parked outside the lines.

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:12.084
I'm Lena Samuelsson,
from the local paper.

01:14:12.167 --> 01:14:14.527
It's about that accident
at the train station the other day.

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:16.501
You actually saved someone's life.

01:14:16.584 --> 01:14:18.792
No, you're mistaken. That wasn't me.

01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:21.209
I was there, you know, and saw it,

01:14:21.292 --> 01:14:25.667
and we run a series called "Invisible
Heroes" where I think you'd fit right in,

01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:30.501
so I've done some research on you,
and you've had a really exciting life.

01:14:30.584 --> 01:14:32.584
- Do you want to talk about that?
- No.

01:14:33.917 --> 01:14:36.959
Well, I have a letter here
from the person you saved.

01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:39.501
You have to read it.
It's really very touching.

01:14:39.584 --> 01:14:42.209
- Let's see if I can find it...
- There we are! Done!

01:14:47.251 --> 01:14:49.001
- No, never mind.
- What? Why?

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.584
- Hello!
- What was that?

01:14:51.334 --> 01:14:53.852
- I didn't hear anything. Come on.
- What happened? I can't see.

01:14:53.876 --> 01:14:55.251
Could you open up?

01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:03.251
Don't look at me, I hadn't locked it.

01:15:03.751 --> 01:15:06.792
Any idiot can work out
how to open that from the inside.

01:15:07.959 --> 01:15:09.251
Idiots.

01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:13.376
Ove!

01:15:15.417 --> 01:15:16.751
Wait!

01:15:20.501 --> 01:15:25.584
Did you actually think she'd go away just
because you shut her in the garage? Eh?

01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:35.251
I mean...

01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:37.751
You're really something else!

01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:57.292
I've been thinking...

01:15:57.667 --> 01:15:59.084
Stop boasting.

01:16:06.751 --> 01:16:08.167
Seriously, though.

01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:11.417
I can help you clear out a little.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.126
Put things away in boxes
and stuff like that.

01:16:15.334 --> 01:16:16.626
There's no need.

01:16:17.376 --> 01:16:19.667
But there is still some
of Sonja's stuff around...

01:16:19.751 --> 01:16:21.251
I said there's no need!

01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:25.626
- Wouldn't it feel good to move on?
- I told you to stop talking.

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:35.001
I mean, I never met Sonja, and she
was probably absolutely wonderful,

01:16:35.084 --> 01:16:37.584
but you've made her into a saint.

01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:41.542
I think she'd rather be a regular human.

01:16:41.626 --> 01:16:44.834
A very wonderful, but regular, Sonja.

01:16:44.917 --> 01:16:47.751
- I said shut up!
- Stop shouting!

01:16:55.126 --> 01:16:57.417
The more all these idiots
keep babbling about her,

01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:02.251
the more they will drown out
the little memory I have of her voice.

01:17:07.209 --> 01:17:10.501
There was nothing before Sonja,
and there is nothing after her.

01:17:12.876 --> 01:17:13.917
I'm something.

01:17:15.542 --> 01:17:17.042
Damn you!

01:17:17.501 --> 01:17:20.084
Stop right there. Stop!

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:31.876
One second...

01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:42.834
If you could just stop
your Neanderthal behavior,

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:45.584
I'm sure we'll get along nicely,
you and I.

01:17:46.251 --> 01:17:48.334
- Now, out of the way.
- Never.

01:17:48.417 --> 01:17:50.334
Get into reverse and clear off.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.721
If you have a problem
with our driving here,

01:17:53.751 --> 01:17:56.209
you'll have to call our case officer
at the local council.

01:17:56.292 --> 01:17:57.917
There are other ways of helping Rune.

01:17:58.001 --> 01:18:00.501
I couldn't care less about Rune,

01:18:00.584 --> 01:18:03.001
but I do care about driving bans.

01:18:05.792 --> 01:18:07.542
Not one inch further.

01:18:17.167 --> 01:18:18.876
Seriously - what's your problem, Ove?

01:18:20.751 --> 01:18:24.084
I know.
You're a nit-picking obstructionist.

01:18:24.751 --> 01:18:27.042
You see, I've done some research on you,

01:18:27.126 --> 01:18:30.584
in local archives and online,

01:18:31.834 --> 01:18:33.751
and I know everything.

01:18:34.417 --> 01:18:40.042
I've read all your crazy letters
to newspapers and authorities.

01:18:40.126 --> 01:18:41.626
I know all about your wife,

01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:45.626
her accident and how you blame it
on everyone and everything.

01:18:48.084 --> 01:18:53.167
But what if the real reason was simply
that you just weren't enough?

01:18:56.959 --> 01:19:00.709
- I'm going to report you.
- I work for a private caregiver.

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:04.417
We only carry out decisions
that have already been taken.

01:19:05.542 --> 01:19:08.917
You need to take better care
of that heart of yours, Ove.

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:19.084
What do you know about my heart? Eh?

01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:24.501
- What do you know about my heart? Eh?
- Go.

01:19:25.584 --> 01:19:27.334
What do you know...

01:19:27.917 --> 01:19:30.334
Stop the car! Stop!

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:32.334
Damn idiot!

01:19:32.751 --> 01:19:35.334
Damned whiteshirts!

01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:40.501
And this is my last warning!

01:19:40.584 --> 01:19:43.626
Tomorrow,
that winter boot becomes a slipper.

01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:45.501
Now he's really lost it...

01:20:18.251 --> 01:20:20.292
Whiteshirt scum!

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:22.501
Ove!

01:20:23.959 --> 01:20:26.084
Hey, Ove! Open up!

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:35.501
Hello! Ove!

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.334
Are you alright?

01:21:23.667 --> 01:21:25.084
Ove!

01:21:25.584 --> 01:21:28.001
Stop now. This is ready.

01:21:31.167 --> 01:21:33.001
Wait. Close your eyes.

01:21:33.584 --> 01:21:35.084
- Close your eyes...
- What...

01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:38.917
Now... Here.

01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:40.084
Stop.

01:21:42.042 --> 01:21:43.251
- What's this?
- Come on!

01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:46.376
- Come on, we're going to dance.
- No. No, no.

01:21:46.459 --> 01:21:48.001
Oh yes. Yes, come on.

01:21:48.084 --> 01:21:50.917
- Come here...
- No, I don't... I don't know how to...

01:21:51.917 --> 01:21:54.084
You can dance on the inside.

01:22:24.959 --> 01:22:27.334
You're going to be a dad.

01:22:29.001 --> 01:22:30.917
We're going to be parents.

01:22:33.251 --> 01:22:35.084
I love you, Ove.

01:22:35.834 --> 01:22:37.334
I love you, too.

01:22:38.751 --> 01:22:40.751
But then we need to get a hatchback.

01:22:41.084 --> 01:22:43.167
Yes. Or... a cradle.

01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:46.584
Great idea. I'll build one.

01:24:23.167 --> 01:24:26.042
Damn hooligans! What are you up to?

01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:33.001
We were going to ask something,

01:24:33.084 --> 01:24:34.844
- but I think we should be leaving...
- What?

01:24:35.459 --> 01:24:38.876
Mirsad has been thrown out.
I thought maybe he could stay here.

01:24:39.876 --> 01:24:41.209
Here?

01:24:42.001 --> 01:24:44.251
Do you think this is a damn hotel?

01:24:45.584 --> 01:24:47.292
Mirsad came out today.

01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:50.292
I told my dad I was one of those gays.

01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:51.876
He hates gays.

01:24:51.959 --> 01:24:57.126
He was going to kill himself
if any of his children were gay.

01:24:57.834 --> 01:25:00.584
But never mind. Come on, let's leave.

01:25:02.334 --> 01:25:04.209
Sonja was always helping people.

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:23.834
Alright. Come on, then.

01:25:49.876 --> 01:25:51.167
Good morning.

01:25:54.209 --> 01:25:56.084
I'll pop some toast in, if that's okay?

01:25:56.167 --> 01:25:57.917
And put some coffee on.

01:26:00.334 --> 01:26:02.167
I'm going to do my round.

01:26:02.251 --> 01:26:04.251
You don't want coffee first?

01:26:05.584 --> 01:26:07.917
I've got some bread
and cheese and stuff.

01:26:15.459 --> 01:26:16.542
Before my round?

01:26:34.209 --> 01:26:36.417
No, I have to do my round, now.

01:26:37.084 --> 01:26:38.501
Can I tag along?

01:26:40.917 --> 01:26:42.542
It's a free country.

01:26:43.584 --> 01:26:45.001
Oh? Alright, then.

01:26:49.584 --> 01:26:50.876
Hang on!

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:57.417
Hi, can I join you?

01:26:58.167 --> 01:26:59.417
I've started exercising.

01:27:00.834 --> 01:27:03.126
- Hello there. I'm Jimmy.
- Hi. Mirsad.

01:27:06.834 --> 01:27:10.334
So your old man's troublesome?

01:27:10.417 --> 01:27:13.251
Well, he's not exactly
beside himself with joy.

01:27:28.584 --> 01:27:30.667
<i>- Have you heard about Rune?
- No.</i>

01:27:31.084 --> 01:27:34.126
They're fetching him tomorrow.
He's being institutionalized.

01:27:34.209 --> 01:27:37.501
Bullshit. It'll take years before that
sort of thing's been through the mill

01:27:37.584 --> 01:27:39.417
and a decision has been reached.

01:27:39.501 --> 01:27:41.001
Ask me, I know.

01:27:41.834 --> 01:27:43.126
I swear.

01:27:43.209 --> 01:27:45.459
The decision has been made.
He goes tomorrow.

01:27:46.417 --> 01:27:49.542
She's pleaded against it for three
years, but now they'll have to part ways.

01:27:49.626 --> 01:27:51.251
What do you mean, three years?

01:27:52.126 --> 01:27:56.751
That's a lie! If so,
Sonja would have known. And so would I.

01:27:56.834 --> 01:28:00.042
Anita didn't tell Sonja.
She didn't want you to know.

01:28:00.126 --> 01:28:02.959
Why on earth
would she want us not to know?

01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:04.834
She didn't want to ask for help.

01:28:04.917 --> 01:28:07.334
She said you had enough
on your plates as it was.

01:28:10.626 --> 01:28:13.042
She said that? Eh?

01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:17.542
That we weren't to know
because we had enough on our plates?

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.417
- Is that what she said?
- Yes. So what?

01:28:24.334 --> 01:28:27.334
Idiot! That's what I've been.

01:28:38.251 --> 01:28:40.126
You mustn't be angry with me, Sonja.

01:28:42.542 --> 01:28:44.917
Admitting you've been wrong is hard.

01:28:45.834 --> 01:28:48.251
Especially when you've been wrong
for a long time.

01:28:51.001 --> 01:28:52.376
I'm sorry.

01:28:56.459 --> 01:28:58.209
But I'm sorting it out now.

01:29:03.084 --> 01:29:06.126
I know you get upset when I get angry,

01:29:06.876 --> 01:29:08.917
but I think you're with me this time.

01:29:10.626 --> 01:29:12.709
This means war!

01:29:13.251 --> 01:29:15.501
Give me every damn document you've had

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:19.334
from the authorities, the social
services, the council, the church...

01:29:19.417 --> 01:29:20.834
I want everything on Rune!

01:29:26.459 --> 01:29:29.584
<i>To reconnect your phone,
please press star...</i>

01:29:32.417 --> 01:29:34.417
May I use your phone?

01:29:36.417 --> 01:29:38.042
Since we're neighbors...

01:29:39.251 --> 01:29:44.126
What the hell does it matter
if they have appealed already?

01:29:44.876 --> 01:29:47.501
There are authorities above you.

01:29:47.584 --> 01:29:50.834
Can't you read?
Are you completely illiterate?

01:29:51.751 --> 01:29:53.834
II-lite-rate!

01:29:53.917 --> 01:29:55.126
Hello?

01:29:56.334 --> 01:29:57.542
Hello!

01:29:59.251 --> 01:30:01.501
How the hell can you talk to someone
who just hangs up?

01:30:01.584 --> 01:30:03.876
How the hell can you talk to someone
who just shouts?

01:30:03.959 --> 01:30:05.709
Well, they refuse to listen.

01:30:06.084 --> 01:30:07.417
Sit down.

01:30:10.126 --> 01:30:11.751
Switch that thing off.

01:30:14.584 --> 01:30:16.501
They are always the same.

01:30:17.584 --> 01:30:20.834
The same people. It's no different now.

01:30:20.917 --> 01:30:23.751
They may have different names,
but they are the same.

01:30:25.292 --> 01:30:30.709
All they want to do is cause trouble,
these damned whiteshirts.

01:30:35.751 --> 01:30:37.209
Listen to yourself.

01:30:38.959 --> 01:30:41.334
You told me never to give up -
didn't you?

01:30:43.001 --> 01:30:46.001
Now you sit there,
feeling sorry for yourself.

01:30:47.251 --> 01:30:49.751
You've had a hard time.
Everyone's an idiot.

01:30:51.084 --> 01:30:52.417
And you just give up.

01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:56.167
Because you think
you're the only one on this planet

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:58.417
who can cope without any help at all.

01:31:00.292 --> 01:31:01.751
But do you know what, Ove?

01:31:02.584 --> 01:31:05.167
No one manages completely on their own.
No one.

01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:06.584
Not even you.

01:31:07.751 --> 01:31:09.209
You can leave now.

01:31:11.334 --> 01:31:12.751
I said you can leave.

01:31:14.584 --> 01:31:16.376
I'm tired of you.

01:31:40.126 --> 01:31:41.917
It was her idea initially.

01:31:43.167 --> 01:31:47.959
To travel together, just the two of us,
before the baby arrived.

01:31:50.001 --> 01:31:52.792
She was determined
that we should go by bus.

01:31:53.584 --> 01:31:57.501
It was more romantic, she said,

01:31:59.251 --> 01:32:00.917
and I didn't argue.

01:32:01.751 --> 01:32:06.001
It made more sense financially, too.

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:41.917
<i>In Spain, Sonja thought one should do
what the Spaniards did,</i>

01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:46.751
<i>while I soon found out
that Spain had quite a lot to learn</i>

01:32:46.834 --> 01:32:49.501
<i>when it came
to Swedish building norms...</i>

01:32:58.876 --> 01:33:00.917
It was grand, though.

01:33:02.001 --> 01:33:04.126
<i>We ate out in the evenings.</i>

01:33:08.001 --> 01:33:13.667
<i>We'd saved some food from our lunch
buffets and had a lovely dinner outside.</i>

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:27.209
And then, one day,
it was time to go home.

01:33:39.751 --> 01:33:40.917
No, no.

01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:46.167
- Did he say something funny?
- He seemed happy.

01:33:55.751 --> 01:33:57.667
- Leave them, Ove.
- What?

01:33:57.751 --> 01:33:59.251
- They're having fun.
- Are they?

01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:00.667
Yes.

01:34:13.834 --> 01:34:18.417
On the bus,
Sonja wanted me to feel her tummy.

01:34:19.084 --> 01:34:22.251
The baby was kicking up
a storm in there.

01:34:22.334 --> 01:34:23.917
Here! Feel!

01:34:29.584 --> 01:34:30.667
Can you feel that?

01:34:31.542 --> 01:34:32.542
It's all the time.

01:34:36.917 --> 01:34:39.542
I just need the bathroom for a minute.

01:35:54.459 --> 01:35:55.834
Sonja!

01:36:10.042 --> 01:36:11.334
Sonja!

01:36:20.417 --> 01:36:21.751
Sonja!

01:36:25.459 --> 01:36:28.292
Help! Help!

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:39.542
You can go in now.

01:36:58.792 --> 01:37:01.542
<i>I think I sat with her like that
for a week.</i>

01:37:02.084 --> 01:37:06.417
<i>No one dared to speak to me,
which was just as well.</i>

01:37:08.292 --> 01:37:09.792
<i>Until one day...</i>

01:37:13.167 --> 01:37:16.084
<i>They told me she'd never wake up again.</i>

01:37:16.667 --> 01:37:19.251
Don't tell me that! Do you hear me!

01:37:21.834 --> 01:37:24.417
<i>But then, the unfathomable happened.</i>

01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:27.834
<i>It was like the best thing
and the worst thing</i>

01:37:27.917 --> 01:37:30.292
<i>happening all at once.</i>

01:37:58.042 --> 01:38:01.542
<i>And the following day,
I had to tell her what had happened.</i>

01:38:31.084 --> 01:38:34.084
About a life which was no more...

01:38:36.626 --> 01:38:39.959
<i>In the middle of that grief,
I felt a kind of inner strength.</i>

01:38:40.042 --> 01:38:45.667
<i>At the beginning, I was able to
use that anger constructively.</i>

01:38:52.084 --> 01:38:54.751
<i>Sonja kept on studying.</i>

01:38:55.751 --> 01:38:58.542
<i>She had one year left
of her teacher's course.</i>

01:38:59.376 --> 01:39:02.667
<i>But when she was done,
there were no jobs.</i>

01:39:02.751 --> 01:39:04.917
- I'm very sorry. Great grades, though.
- Thank you.

01:39:05.001 --> 01:39:08.542
<i>In those days, schools weren't equipped
with wheelchair ramps.</i>

01:39:11.876 --> 01:39:17.209
<i>But then one day,
Sonja showed me an ad in the paper.</i>

01:39:17.292 --> 01:39:18.667
...for special needs...

01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:24.417
<i>They'd created a class for all
the youngsters with special needs</i>

01:39:24.501 --> 01:39:27.042
<i>before "special needs"
had even been invented.</i>

01:39:27.626 --> 01:39:29.167
Your resume is really very good,

01:39:29.251 --> 01:39:34.417
but as you can see, we can't take on
a wheelchair-bound teacher.

01:39:37.251 --> 01:39:40.167
<i>That's when I entered
into a big black hole.</i>

01:39:40.251 --> 01:39:43.167
<i>I wanted to obliterate them all.
Every single son-of-a-bitch:</i>

01:39:43.251 --> 01:39:45.626
<i>The bus company, the drunken driver,</i>

01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:48.667
<i>the wine merchant, the travel group...
All of them.</i>

01:39:49.167 --> 01:39:53.917
<i>I wrote to the Spanish and Swedish
governments, but no one cared.</i>

01:39:54.334 --> 01:39:56.542
The basic idea is
that you build one starting

01:39:56.626 --> 01:39:58.834
from the steps by the entrance,
and then...

01:39:58.917 --> 01:40:01.334
<i>They didn't even want
to build a simple ramp</i>

01:40:01.417 --> 01:40:03.917
<i>so Sonja could start working
at the school.</i>

01:40:04.584 --> 01:40:07.834
<i>I sued them all in an attempt
to get some kind of justice</i>

01:40:07.917 --> 01:40:09.001
REJECTED

01:40:09.084 --> 01:40:11.417
<i>in a situation I could
see none in myself.</i>

01:40:11.751 --> 01:40:13.751
<i>In the end, it came down to Sonja.</i>

01:40:14.542 --> 01:40:16.917
<i>She was the strongest of us all.</i>

01:40:17.792 --> 01:40:19.042
Ove...

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:27.084
Either we die - or we live.

01:40:32.834 --> 01:40:34.542
<i>That evening, I took the car</i>

01:40:35.084 --> 01:40:37.959
<i>and went and built what was needed.</i>

01:40:52.334 --> 01:40:55.001
<i>The following day,
Sonja could start work.</i>

01:41:01.417 --> 01:41:03.209
Welcome.

01:41:06.959 --> 01:41:10.667
Homer was the one who wrote
the <i>Iliad</i> about the Trojan War,

01:41:10.751 --> 01:41:13.334
but when was it written?

01:41:13.417 --> 01:41:15.667
- David?
- In 700.

01:41:15.751 --> 01:41:17.334
Before Christ.

01:41:17.417 --> 01:41:18.584
Fuck.

01:41:25.751 --> 01:41:28.501
Okay,
let's all say hello to Rickard Stenebo.

01:41:28.584 --> 01:41:30.209
Hi, Rickard!

01:41:31.501 --> 01:41:33.251
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

01:41:34.251 --> 01:41:37.792
After one year, the same kids were able

01:41:37.876 --> 01:41:42.251
to recite 400-year-old poetry
at the end of term ceremony.

01:41:43.251 --> 01:41:46.251
"...how infinite in faculty

01:41:46.959 --> 01:41:53.209
In apprehension how like a god

01:41:54.792 --> 01:41:57.084
The paragon of animals

01:41:58.334 --> 01:41:59.917
And yet, to me...

01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:04.251
this quintessence of dust"

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.001
Bravo!

01:42:14.001 --> 01:42:16.209
She fought for everything that was good.

01:42:21.376 --> 01:42:23.334
For the children she never had.

01:42:28.834 --> 01:42:32.417
And six months ago, she passed away.
She had cancer.

01:42:36.167 --> 01:42:38.584
I promised to follow.

01:43:10.334 --> 01:43:13.001
Okeydoke. Is he ready?

01:43:13.084 --> 01:43:15.001
This is as far as you get.

01:43:17.251 --> 01:43:21.417
You've had three years now
to arrange this without a fuss.

01:43:22.542 --> 01:43:24.334
The decision has been taken.

01:43:25.542 --> 01:43:27.917
We're doing this for you, Anita.

01:43:28.417 --> 01:43:30.167
What kind of love would that be?

01:43:30.667 --> 01:43:33.542
To part when you need
one another the most?

01:43:35.542 --> 01:43:41.251
But the problem is that 24 hours a day,
he has no idea of where he is.

01:43:42.376 --> 01:43:44.042
No, but I do.

01:43:44.667 --> 01:43:45.876
Yes...

01:43:47.376 --> 01:43:49.917
- And who is going to look after him?
- I will.

01:43:50.376 --> 01:43:51.584
I see.

01:43:51.667 --> 01:43:52.876
With a bit of help.

01:43:54.209 --> 01:43:56.251
Oh, a bit of help. From whom?

01:43:59.084 --> 01:44:02.751
Hello! Good to see you!
I'm Lena from the local paper.

01:44:03.167 --> 01:44:04.709
- Hello.
- Well, it's like this...

01:44:05.501 --> 01:44:08.834
I've got the last three years'
annual accounts here

01:44:08.917 --> 01:44:12.542
for the private care company Konsensus,
where you are one of the owners.

01:44:12.626 --> 01:44:15.501
You're reporting a minor profit.

01:44:15.584 --> 01:44:19.834
But I also have statements
from a Channel Island bank,

01:44:19.917 --> 01:44:23.334
showing deposits
of several untaxed millions.

01:44:23.417 --> 01:44:26.667
- Where the hell did you get that?
- Online.

01:44:27.167 --> 01:44:30.560
I could talk to my editor, because I'm sure
he would love to investigate this further -

01:44:30.584 --> 01:44:33.917
but that decision is mine,
if you see what I mean.

01:44:56.084 --> 01:44:57.876
He just rolled over. I don't know...

01:45:00.792 --> 01:45:02.501
Things were better in our day.

01:45:03.834 --> 01:45:06.917
At least then people fought
for what they believed in.

01:45:44.834 --> 01:45:46.126
Ove!

01:45:47.584 --> 01:45:48.917
Ove!

01:45:50.084 --> 01:45:52.042
Ove! Call an ambulance!

01:45:52.126 --> 01:45:55.876
Don't... let the ambulance...
drive on the path!

01:46:37.084 --> 01:46:40.834
- Parvaneh, you're down as next of kin.
- That's correct.

01:46:40.917 --> 01:46:43.834
Your dad is suffering
from a heart problem.

01:46:43.917 --> 01:46:46.334
You could say that his heart is too big.

01:46:48.126 --> 01:46:50.292
Sorry? Too big?

01:46:50.376 --> 01:46:53.167
Yes. But he'll survive.

01:47:02.417 --> 01:47:03.876
Ove, seriously...

01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:07.584
You're amazingly bad at dying.

01:47:21.251 --> 01:47:23.126
Shit, I think it's time, Ove!

01:47:34.417 --> 01:47:37.167
Well, it was really only standing up
there collecting dust.

01:47:37.251 --> 01:47:38.834
It was never used.

01:47:38.917 --> 01:47:41.584
It's amazing, Ove. Thank you.

01:47:41.667 --> 01:47:43.876
It might benefit from a lick of paint...

01:47:43.959 --> 01:47:45.251
Here. Hold it.

01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:47.584
I want to show Patrick.

01:47:59.209 --> 01:48:00.792
Hello there.

01:48:10.251 --> 01:48:11.542
Try this...

01:48:19.042 --> 01:48:20.792
That works well, doesn't it?

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:30.834
Well,
I think you should have something, too.

01:48:30.917 --> 01:48:33.917
An iPad! Thanks, Grandpa!

01:48:34.001 --> 01:48:35.542
Yes... Thanks.

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:38.209
I recognize that feeling.

01:48:39.167 --> 01:48:41.251
It's just like buying a new car.

01:48:47.876 --> 01:48:49.542
This is the life.

01:49:08.417 --> 01:49:11.876
Hey,
Ove's front path hasn't been shoveled.

01:49:12.251 --> 01:49:15.084
- So what?
- It's eight o'clock.

01:49:16.001 --> 01:49:17.459
Time for his round.

01:49:24.584 --> 01:49:25.584
Ove?

01:49:55.834 --> 01:49:58.709
<i>Don't worry
about me having done something silly.</i>

01:49:59.834 --> 01:50:03.959
<i>When you read this, the doctor's
prediction will have been fulfilled.</i>

01:50:04.917 --> 01:50:07.501
<i>He said my heart was too big.</i>

01:50:08.376 --> 01:50:12.251
<i>It may sound sweet,
but it isn't all that good.</i>

01:50:13.459 --> 01:50:15.751
<i>Sooner or later, you pay.</i>

01:50:17.417 --> 01:50:21.167
<i>I'd like to have a proper funeral
in a proper church.</i>

01:50:21.584 --> 01:50:26.876
<i>None of this nonsense
with ashes scattered in the wind.</i>

01:50:27.792 --> 01:50:29.167
<i>And I want a quiet funeral,</i>

01:50:29.251 --> 01:50:32.959
<i>with only those present
who thought I pulled my weight.</i>

01:50:33.667 --> 01:50:38.167
<i>The cat has tuna twice a day
and wants to shit in private.</i>

01:50:38.251 --> 01:50:39.667
<i>Please respect that.</i>

01:50:39.751 --> 01:50:43.959
<i>And above all, make damn sure
the bastards don't drive on our paths.</i>

01:50:44.305 --> 01:50:50.462
