00:09.038 --> 00:10.121
<i>There's something so phony</i>

00:10.155 --> 00:12.840
<i>about Christmas in Chatswin...</i>

00:12.875 --> 00:15.960
<i>Everything plastic</i>
<i>and professionally decorated.</i>

00:15.995 --> 00:17.962
<i>There was also something phony</i>
<i>about dad.</i>

00:18.030 --> 00:20.064
<i>After discovering he had</i>
<i>a secret life in Manhattan,</i>

00:20.099 --> 00:24.302
<i>I had no other choice but to</i>
<i>give him the ice treatment.</i>

00:29.642 --> 00:31.709
Did we get the best tree
at the farm or what?

00:31.744 --> 00:33.394
Fraser fir.

00:33.429 --> 00:36.281
You smell? You smell
how fresh those needles are?

00:36.315 --> 00:37.582
Why did we even bother
with a tree?

00:37.616 --> 00:40.184
Aren't you gonna spend
Christmas in New York with Zoe?

00:40.219 --> 00:42.620
<i>Now I had administered</i>
<i>the ice treatment,</i>

00:42.655 --> 00:45.440
<i>but never successfully</i>
<i>until tonight.</i>

00:45.474 --> 00:48.276
<i>You're dumping me?</i>
<i>Like, now?</i>

00:48.310 --> 00:51.295
Not... not dumping, no.
Not at all. No.

00:51.313 --> 00:52.764
But... yes, now.

00:52.798 --> 00:55.867
<i>Whenever</i>
<i>I start to feel something...</i>

00:55.901 --> 00:59.971
<i>Whenever I start to feel...</i>

01:00.005 --> 01:01.739
Oh, o-okay.

01:01.774 --> 01:02.907
Shh. It's okay. Don't cry.

01:02.941 --> 01:05.209
<i>I need a tissue or...</i>

01:07.379 --> 01:09.881
Okay, look, it's not you.
It's...

01:09.915 --> 01:11.582
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

01:11.617 --> 01:14.185
<i>I swear to God, if you say,</i>
<i>"it's not you, it's me... "</i>

01:14.219 --> 01:15.553
I was going to say

01:15.587 --> 01:18.956
it is not you. It's...
It's Tessa, my daughter.

01:18.991 --> 01:21.592
You know, I - I uprooted her
from New York

01:21.627 --> 01:22.894
- and everything she knows.
<i>- Yeah? So?</i>

01:22.928 --> 01:24.395
So it's a total double standard

01:24.430 --> 01:26.898
if I date a cool city girl
like you

01:26.932 --> 01:28.433
when I've confined Tessa
to the suburbs.

01:28.467 --> 01:30.601
<i>But I'm crazy about you,</i>
<i>George.</i>

01:30.636 --> 01:32.837
A-and I you,

01:32.871 --> 01:35.540
but if I continue seeing you,
I will feel like a bad dad.

01:41.747 --> 01:43.097
Take care, though.

01:45.951 --> 01:47.652
Dad, you didn't have to break up
with her because of me.

01:47.686 --> 01:50.354
T-t... oh, Tessa.

01:50.372 --> 01:51.923
Eavesdropping, were we?

01:51.957 --> 01:53.424
Was it the ice treatment?

01:53.459 --> 01:56.544
Yes, in fact, it was.
You know what?

01:56.578 --> 01:59.263
Maybe next time,
you will think twice

01:59.298 --> 02:00.732
before you ice someone.

02:00.766 --> 02:02.300
But you really liked Zoe.

02:02.334 --> 02:03.601
Yes, I did.

02:03.635 --> 02:07.838
But sometimes parents sacrifice
things that they like

02:07.856 --> 02:09.340
for their children.

02:09.375 --> 02:10.842
If you will excuse me,

02:10.876 --> 02:13.478
I'm going to drink this
in my room.

02:13.512 --> 02:15.046
Did he drink it
in his room?

02:15.080 --> 02:17.315
I think he did.

02:17.349 --> 02:19.584
Wow, that is everything
you want in a Christmas story,

02:19.618 --> 02:20.785
except a happy ending.

02:22.154 --> 02:24.655
- Maybe I can make it up to him.
- You should.

02:24.690 --> 02:25.857
I just need to get him
the best Christmas gift

02:25.891 --> 02:27.375
any daughter's ever given
their father.

02:27.426 --> 02:29.260
How about
an eyeglass repair kit?

02:29.294 --> 02:30.728
Doesn't exactly say

02:30.763 --> 02:32.497
"sorry you gave up love
for me."

02:32.531 --> 02:35.299
No, but they usually come with
a bottle of cleaning solution

02:35.334 --> 02:37.185
and a lint-free shammy,
so...

02:37.236 --> 02:39.370
There's not one good thing
on the whole entire Internet.

02:39.405 --> 02:40.605
What are you getting
your dad?

02:40.639 --> 02:43.141
Nothing. We make our gifts.

02:43.175 --> 02:44.642
That sounds cool.

02:44.676 --> 02:47.845
It's not.
I want clothes.

03:04.730 --> 03:05.963
I made you a sandwich.

03:05.998 --> 03:07.064
What kind of sandwich?

03:07.099 --> 03:08.766
Tuna.

03:08.801 --> 03:11.169
Tuna reminds me of Zoe.

03:17.309 --> 03:20.328
Well... I should get to class.

03:20.379 --> 03:23.113
<i>Watching the cooking channel</i>

03:23.165 --> 03:28.352
<i>and taking an adult ed class</i>
<i>in wreath making.</i>

03:28.387 --> 03:30.588
Wonderful job.

03:30.622 --> 03:32.256
Lovely.

03:32.290 --> 03:34.509
Hey, what's the deal
with the art teacher... Aimee?

03:34.560 --> 03:35.893
What do you mean,
"what's the deal?"

03:35.928 --> 03:38.095
There is no deal.
She teaches art.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.130
Is she single? Shh!

03:40.149 --> 03:41.933
Oh, my. What can I say?

03:41.967 --> 03:44.435
They're both so full
of beauty.

03:44.470 --> 03:46.354
True, but isn't one filled
with... I don't know...

03:46.405 --> 03:48.639
A thousand times more beauty
than the other?

03:48.674 --> 03:50.358
No, not to me.

03:50.409 --> 03:53.311
That's like asking what's more
magical... flowers or rainbows?

03:53.345 --> 03:55.379
Rainbows.
Is there any question?

03:55.414 --> 03:56.531
Aimee?

03:56.582 --> 03:58.533
Um... when you have a minute.

03:58.584 --> 04:00.034
Aimee to the rescue.

04:00.085 --> 04:01.819
Yeah.

04:01.837 --> 04:03.538
You know what?

04:03.589 --> 04:05.155
After dating so many
crazy, cynical Manhattan women,

04:05.174 --> 04:07.725
I really find Aimee
refreshing.

04:07.759 --> 04:09.627
Ginger ale is refreshing.

04:09.661 --> 04:12.380
You know, I like her positivity
and her... and her sweetness.

04:12.431 --> 04:14.699
You know, she's sweet,
and she's crafty.

04:14.733 --> 04:16.334
She makes things.

04:16.368 --> 04:18.351
I'm gonna ask her out.

04:18.387 --> 04:20.170
- Slow down, white tiger.
- Yeah.

04:20.189 --> 04:21.873
Aimee just went through
a nasty breakup

04:21.906 --> 04:23.174
with the shop teacher.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.976
She's a little gun-shy, okay?
A little vulnerable.

04:25.010 --> 04:26.310
Huh.

04:26.345 --> 04:29.947
So don't blow it
by coming on too... New York.

04:29.982 --> 04:31.482
Pushy.

04:31.517 --> 04:33.518
You're kind of pushy.

04:33.552 --> 04:35.987
But I wouldn't be
if I were trying to date you.

04:36.021 --> 04:39.323
Oh, what a shame, Aimee.
Honestly?

04:39.358 --> 04:40.825
I can't imagine you not
having a Christmas tree.

04:40.859 --> 04:42.827
I know.
It's my roommates, though.

04:42.861 --> 04:44.579
They're, um,
Jehovah's witnesses.

04:44.613 --> 04:47.098
They're really nice
but a little clique-y.

04:47.132 --> 04:50.384
Anyway, I... I sure will
miss the smell of pine.

04:50.419 --> 04:52.553
- I have the smell of pine.
- What's that?

04:52.604 --> 04:53.771
Uh, I was...
I was just saying

04:53.805 --> 04:56.574
that I have
a great, big, giant tree...

04:56.608 --> 04:59.143
That smells like pine.
Oh.

04:59.177 --> 05:00.962
That I cut down myself.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.480
Wow.

05:02.514 --> 05:03.447
That wasn't sarcastic.

05:03.482 --> 05:05.550
Sarcastic? Oh, gosh, no.

05:05.584 --> 05:07.585
You... you didn't mean
"gosh, no" ironically?

05:07.619 --> 05:09.453
No! Gosh.

05:09.488 --> 05:11.022
I'm just checking.

05:11.056 --> 05:12.240
So what do you say,
you wanna...

05:12.274 --> 05:14.759
You wanna swing by my house,
help me trim the tree?

05:15.894 --> 05:18.262
There's a...
An open house kind of thing.

05:18.297 --> 05:19.614
Lot of people, no pressure.

05:19.648 --> 05:23.117
Just a... cool...
hang kinda... sitch.

05:23.151 --> 05:26.270
When you put it like that,
it sounds like a blast.

05:26.305 --> 05:28.806
And that was sincere.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.192
Sincerely,
I would love to come.

05:31.226 --> 05:32.193
Great.

05:32.227 --> 05:33.344
- What time should we be there?
- What?

05:33.378 --> 05:34.712
I'll bring my Pa Jun.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.067
<i>Frankincense, myrrh,</i>

05:40.102 --> 05:42.253
<i>soap-on-a-rope?</i>

05:42.287 --> 05:43.721
<i>None of these gifts</i>
<i>were gonna cut it.</i>

05:43.755 --> 05:46.023
<i>This year, the only thing</i>
<i>I could give George</i>

05:46.058 --> 05:48.693
<i>was the one thing</i>
<i>I had taken away...</i>

05:49.695 --> 05:51.128
<i>Zoe.</i>

05:52.564 --> 05:55.066
It wasn't you. It was <i>me.</i>

05:55.100 --> 05:56.767
<i>I got blindsided,</i>

05:56.802 --> 05:59.170
<i>like Sandra Bullock</i>
<i>in that movie, "The Proposal."</i>

05:59.204 --> 06:01.706
<i>I don't know if I can put</i>
<i>myself out there again.</i>

06:01.740 --> 06:03.457
Oh, come on.

06:03.492 --> 06:04.542
You look like the kind of woman

06:04.576 --> 06:05.943
who puts herself
out there a lot.

06:05.978 --> 06:08.713
<i>- I do, yeah.</i> 
<i>- I have a big heart.</i>

06:08.747 --> 06:11.716
And this time, I promise
I won't be an obstacle to love.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.517
Please come
to the tree-trimming?

06:13.552 --> 06:16.654
<i>Oh, mother Mary, kid.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

06:16.688 --> 06:19.757
George misses you.

06:19.791 --> 06:23.027
- He's not himself.
- I've never seen him like this.

06:23.061 --> 06:24.362
<i>Yeah?</i>

06:25.430 --> 06:27.698
<i>Well... the sex was rockin',</i>

06:27.733 --> 06:30.635
<i>and I do get super horny</i>
<i>around Christmas.</i>

06:30.669 --> 06:32.836
<i>Okay! I'm in.</i>

06:32.854 --> 06:35.272
You are gonna be the best gift
I ever got him.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.408
<i>So what's the best way</i>
<i>to get there?</i>

06:37.442 --> 06:39.577
<i>Should I mapquest it?</i>
<i>Or Google maps?</i>

06:39.611 --> 06:41.862
<i>She would figure it out.</i>

06:44.953 --> 06:46.921
Honey, terrific news.

06:46.955 --> 06:49.540
Looks like all those leg presses
are finally starting to pay off.

06:49.574 --> 06:50.925
Well, how could they not?

06:50.959 --> 06:53.060
I'll bet you my thighs minimum...
<i>Minimum,</i>

06:53.094 --> 06:55.062
are an inch bigger
than last Christmas.

06:55.096 --> 06:57.465
- No way I'm taking that bet.
- That's a smart lady.

07:03.355 --> 07:05.473
George.

07:16.885 --> 07:17.985
Ahh.

07:18.019 --> 07:19.537
Hey.

07:19.571 --> 07:21.522
Oh! George!

07:21.540 --> 07:22.873
I was just thinking
about you.

07:22.908 --> 07:25.092
Steven let me in.
I don't think he likes me.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.727
Oh! Don't be silly.

07:26.761 --> 07:28.262
Well,
I wanted to invite you

07:28.296 --> 07:30.631
to a tree-trimming tonight.
I know it's last minute,

07:30.665 --> 07:31.882
but maybe...

07:31.917 --> 07:33.167
Oh, I would absolutely love
to be there.

07:33.201 --> 07:37.505
Absolutely. It's only...
Shoot.

07:37.539 --> 07:39.490
I'm headed off to go skiing
in Aspen.

07:39.524 --> 07:41.926
Oh.
It's a Royce family tradition.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.677
Steven loves the way he looks
in his ski pants.

07:43.712 --> 07:45.546
That's too bad.
You'll be missed.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.181
Anyway, I guess I'll see you
when you get back.

07:47.215 --> 07:48.832
Until then, here you go.

07:49.885 --> 07:51.519
For me? From you?

07:51.553 --> 07:52.586
Just a little something
for under your tree.

07:52.621 --> 07:54.522
I hope you like it.

07:54.556 --> 07:56.824
Oh, George.
I'm gonna love.

07:56.858 --> 07:58.993
<i>'Twas the night</i>
<i>before Christmas,</i>

07:59.027 --> 08:00.794
<i>- and I had...</i> 
<i>- Nailed it.</i>

08:00.829 --> 08:02.129
<i>I had gotten dad a present</i>

08:02.163 --> 08:04.831
<i>too big to fit under the tree.</i>
<i>In a matter of minutes,</i>

08:04.849 --> 08:07.001
<i>Zoe was gonna walk</i>
<i>across our threshold to see...</i>

08:09.454 --> 08:11.605
<i>George all over Ms. Ainsley,</i>
<i>the art teacher?!</i>

08:11.640 --> 08:13.624
Terrifying.

08:16.611 --> 08:18.379
You can't take my coat
'cause I'm not wearing one.

08:18.413 --> 08:20.447
Mother told me to,
but I refused,

08:20.482 --> 08:23.350
since you live right across
the street.

08:23.384 --> 08:25.352
It's cold. I ran partway.

08:25.387 --> 08:27.021
Zoe's gonna
be here any second,

08:27.072 --> 08:28.539
and George is all over
Ms. Ainsley.

08:28.573 --> 08:29.657
Ms. Ainsley? Why?

08:29.691 --> 08:31.458
He's rebounding... hard.

08:31.493 --> 08:32.643
I've been there, sister.

08:32.693 --> 08:33.943
Okay, so here's the plan.

08:33.979 --> 08:35.746
I need you to wait
outside for Zoe

08:35.780 --> 08:37.431
and delight her
while I get rid of Ms. Ainsley.

08:37.465 --> 08:38.765
- That's the plan?
- Yeah.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.134
Let's try it.

08:41.686 --> 08:43.486
I don't have a coat.

08:46.174 --> 08:47.741
Oh, hi.

08:47.776 --> 08:51.095
Have you tried the pa jun?
I don't know who made it,

08:51.146 --> 08:54.865
but someone knows their way
around a Korean pancake.

08:58.486 --> 09:01.722
George! I wouldn't interrupt
unless this was super important,

09:01.756 --> 09:03.190
but we are out of eggnog.

09:03.224 --> 09:05.225
What? I...  I just made
a batch ten minutes ago.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.527
I don't know the specifics.

09:06.561 --> 09:08.829
I just know people
are in need of nog.

09:08.863 --> 09:12.866
I'll be right back.

09:14.586 --> 09:18.205
You know, your dad is
the nicest parent at school.

09:18.239 --> 09:19.506
And the cutest.

09:19.541 --> 09:23.077
Really? Uh... 'Cause at home,
he's a bit of a slob.

09:23.111 --> 09:24.228
You should see his bathroom.

09:24.262 --> 09:27.448
Some mornings, it's like...
Crime scene.

09:27.482 --> 09:29.516
Whoa!

09:29.551 --> 09:31.969
That snow is <i>really</i>
coming down.

09:32.020 --> 09:34.088
If I were you,
I would leave right now,

09:34.122 --> 09:35.255
or else...

09:35.273 --> 09:38.258
You might get stranded
in a snowbank...

09:38.276 --> 09:39.643
And die.

09:45.298 --> 09:46.582
Hey, hey!

09:46.616 --> 09:47.783
Hey, buddy.

09:47.818 --> 09:48.984
Any hits on the mistletoe?

09:49.018 --> 09:49.919
Huh?

09:50.987 --> 09:52.872
- Great bash, Georgie.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:52.906 --> 09:54.557
Didn't realize you knew
so many asians.

09:54.591 --> 09:55.558
<i>Ni hao!</i>

09:57.310 --> 09:58.527
It's like "the joy luck club"
in here.

09:58.561 --> 09:59.829
Yeah, I had a hard time
scaring up guests.

09:59.863 --> 10:01.564
Most of them are from
this Dim Sum restaurant

10:01.598 --> 10:02.631
I designed a patio for.

10:02.649 --> 10:04.800
Do yourself a favor, though.

10:04.835 --> 10:06.786
Try the juicy buns.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.804
Mmm! Hell, yeah!

10:08.839 --> 10:10.305
Right? Out of this world,
Mrs. yee.

10:11.274 --> 10:13.259
Oh, hey!

10:13.310 --> 10:14.727
How's it going
with the art teacher?

10:14.778 --> 10:17.680
Oh, really great. She's so
uncomplicated, you know?

10:17.714 --> 10:20.716
In a good way. I think I finally
broke the crazy woman curse.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.951
I'm sick.

10:21.985 --> 10:23.519
What?
Did you have any of these?

10:23.553 --> 10:24.653
I think you should
send everyone home

10:24.688 --> 10:26.021
or at least anyone
that looks like

10:26.055 --> 10:27.473
they have a weak immune system.

10:28.525 --> 10:30.059
Like Aimee?

10:30.093 --> 10:32.962
Okay, what's going on, Tess?
Is that what this is about?

10:32.996 --> 10:33.979
Aimee?

10:34.030 --> 10:36.065
I can't talk. I have to puke.

10:36.099 --> 10:37.299
I can't believe
all the flights are grounded.

10:37.334 --> 10:39.552
I'll be in my room.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.504
<i>My</i> room, so don't follow me,
Yakult!

10:41.538 --> 10:42.638
Maybe it's a sign.

10:42.656 --> 10:43.989
I'm gonna go call
a travel agent.

10:44.024 --> 10:46.441
God, mom, call Yakult!

11:11.668 --> 11:16.372
Oh, my gosh, George.
You remembered.

11:22.546 --> 11:24.413
- She's here.
- Zoe's here!

11:26.616 --> 11:28.417
Hey, hey.

11:28.451 --> 11:30.786
You have been acting weird
all night

11:30.821 --> 11:32.788
and... and borderline rude
to Aimee.

11:32.823 --> 11:34.757
So what's going on?

11:34.791 --> 11:36.108
I heard she doesn't
support our troops.

11:40.096 --> 11:41.664
I've been trying
to get rid of her.

11:41.698 --> 11:44.233
What? Because you don't
like Aimee?

11:44.267 --> 11:46.869
I like her fine, I guess.
It's you who doesn't like her.

11:46.903 --> 11:48.737
What are you talking about?

11:48.771 --> 11:50.873
You were crushed
about your breakup with Zoe.

11:50.907 --> 11:53.125
Aimee's a rebound.
It's understandable.

11:53.176 --> 11:54.226
Okay, listen to me carefully.
I do like Aimee.

11:54.261 --> 11:55.411
The whole reason I'm having
this party

11:55.445 --> 11:56.846
is so I can spend time
with her.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.913
But you like Zoe.

11:57.948 --> 12:00.282
You only broke up with her
because of me.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.252
That... that's not...
entirely true.

12:03.286 --> 12:05.521
But you couldn't eat tuna.

12:05.555 --> 12:08.040
You really gotta be
in the mood for tuna.

12:08.091 --> 12:11.393
George... help me understand
what I'm hearing.

12:11.411 --> 12:12.895
The truth is,
I broke up with Zoe

12:12.913 --> 12:17.600
not because of you but because
she's really, really annoying

12:17.634 --> 12:20.336
and volatile... and negative.

12:21.404 --> 12:23.706
And a little bit
of a slutty lush.

12:25.675 --> 12:27.309
Well, I hope
you're in the mood for tuna.

12:29.445 --> 12:30.980
He...

12:31.014 --> 12:32.748
Merry Christmas, George.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.485
Oh, uh...

12:36.519 --> 12:38.020
<i>I hope George made his bed,</i>

12:38.054 --> 12:40.589
<i>because it looked like he was</i>
<i>gonna have to lay in it...</i>

12:40.623 --> 12:42.558
<i>With her.</i>
Mm.

12:42.592 --> 12:44.293
<i>Or her.</i>

12:44.311 --> 12:45.594
Uh...

12:45.629 --> 12:47.529
<i>Or... who knows?</i>

12:47.564 --> 12:48.664
<i>Her.</i>

12:48.698 --> 12:51.233
Uh...

12:52.247 --> 12:53.280
I'm so embarrassed.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.281
I thought you invited me
because you liked me.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.083
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Please.

12:56.736 --> 12:58.370
I-I <i>do</i> like you.

12:58.388 --> 12:59.938
I thought you <i>like</i> liked me
in a different way

12:59.973 --> 13:02.508
than you like the Chinese family
that makes Dim Sum.

13:02.542 --> 13:03.675
I like you
in a much different way

13:03.710 --> 13:06.912
than I like the Dim Sum family...
The Yees.

13:06.946 --> 13:09.281
Then why were you kissing
that loud woman?

13:09.315 --> 13:12.267
Oh. Well... okay,
I know it's poor form

13:12.318 --> 13:13.569
to blame your daughter
for things,

13:13.603 --> 13:17.189
but... this time,
it really is Tessa's fault.

13:17.223 --> 13:20.526
So will you please
come back inside?

13:20.560 --> 13:22.094
I drive, like, once a decade,

13:22.128 --> 13:24.930
- and last time with a moped...
- In Jamaica.

13:24.964 --> 13:27.966
- Sandals.
- Half sloshed on piña coladas.

13:28.001 --> 13:31.587
So, I mean, you can imagine
how freakin' terrified I was,

13:31.621 --> 13:34.072
driving to the middle
of nowhere... face it...

13:34.107 --> 13:36.408
You know, at night. My hand
to God, I thought I was dead,

13:36.442 --> 13:39.178
like, 10... no, 12... 12 times.

13:39.212 --> 13:42.381
But I did it all for George.

13:42.415 --> 13:43.949
I did it all for love.

13:43.983 --> 13:46.134
Aw!

13:47.520 --> 13:50.189
Damn right, "aw."
Now someone, anyone,

13:50.223 --> 13:51.923
point me to the drinks.

13:51.941 --> 13:53.125
Two chicks?

13:53.159 --> 13:54.610
You must have been very good
this year, or very bad.

13:54.644 --> 13:56.478
Either way... two chicks!

13:56.529 --> 13:58.447
I have no idea
of what to do here.

13:58.481 --> 14:00.765
If I tell Zoe the truth,
she's going to make a scene,

14:00.783 --> 14:03.118
and... and sweet,
uncomplicated Aimee

14:03.152 --> 14:04.236
is going to bolt
from that coatroom

14:04.270 --> 14:05.287
like a frightened rabbit.

14:05.321 --> 14:06.989
George, I'm a dentist.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.907
I'm trained
to give people bad news.

14:08.942 --> 14:11.126
It's what I do all day,
every day.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.511
I'll talk to Zoe for you.

14:12.545 --> 14:15.214
The secret is
in the soothing dentist voice.

14:15.248 --> 14:17.616
I'm gonna need one thing
from you, though...

14:17.650 --> 14:20.252
Soft rock.
I can do that.

14:29.028 --> 14:32.764
You son of a bitch!
What doing with my juicy bun?

14:32.798 --> 14:35.267
They looked a little dried out.
I didn't wanna embarrass you.

14:43.643 --> 14:45.477
Lisa?

14:46.813 --> 14:48.914
Have you been out here
this whole time?

14:48.948 --> 14:51.450
It's freezing.

14:51.484 --> 14:52.818
Was out there waiting
for you,

14:52.852 --> 14:55.020
and then your dad
and Ms. Ainsley came out.

14:55.054 --> 14:56.788
The way the "like-likes"
were flying around,

14:56.823 --> 14:58.557
I think she could be
your new mom.

14:58.591 --> 15:00.125
- My new mom?
- Yeah.

15:00.159 --> 15:01.460
Your brain must have frozen.
I'm gonna make you some hot tea,

15:01.494 --> 15:02.995
and you'll feel better.

15:03.029 --> 15:05.664
Tessa, I had some time to think
while I was out there,

15:05.698 --> 15:10.469
and... it occurred to me
that there's a reason

15:10.503 --> 15:14.806
why you feel so guilty about
coming between your dad and Zoe.

15:16.609 --> 15:19.811
Do... do you wanna know
what the reason is?

15:19.846 --> 15:21.146
Lemon zinger sound good?

15:21.180 --> 15:22.547
It's because you knew
in your heart

15:22.582 --> 15:24.549
it's quite possible
that you've come between him

15:24.584 --> 15:26.401
and a hundred other Zoes.

15:26.452 --> 15:28.787
Not true.
George has dated,

15:28.821 --> 15:29.955
and I have known
George has dated,

15:29.989 --> 15:34.092
I just haven't necessarily
seen it before.

15:34.127 --> 15:35.327
Oh.

15:35.361 --> 15:38.597
Tessa, your dad's hot.

15:38.631 --> 15:40.132
He deserves some action.

15:40.199 --> 15:43.568
I'm gonna think over
everything you just said

15:43.603 --> 15:45.070
but the last part.

15:45.104 --> 15:47.706
I'm not going to lie.

15:47.724 --> 15:50.642
There's going to be
some discomfort, even pain.

15:50.677 --> 15:53.879
But then you'll never have
to worry about it again, hmm?

15:53.913 --> 15:59.851
Or... you could ignore it,
pretend like everything's good

15:59.886 --> 16:01.219
and healthy.

16:01.237 --> 16:04.823
But then you run the risk
of things decaying further.

16:04.857 --> 16:07.225
Um...

16:07.243 --> 16:09.695
Where's George?

16:09.729 --> 16:10.929
Don't worry.

16:10.964 --> 16:15.033
Hey.
We'll bring that smile back.

16:15.068 --> 16:16.618
Donk!

16:16.669 --> 16:19.137
Okay.

16:21.741 --> 16:23.942
Oh, Tessa.

16:23.977 --> 16:25.910
Can you help me find
my capelet?

16:25.928 --> 16:28.647
Okay. But I just wanted
to say I think I overstated

16:28.681 --> 16:30.882
the mess that George leaves
in his bathroom.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.150
It's good to know.

16:32.185 --> 16:34.686
I'm serious.
He's... he's practically tidy.

16:34.721 --> 16:37.622
Never leaves the seat up,
goes the extra mile

16:37.657 --> 16:39.925
and rinses down his
toothpaste clumps in the sink.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.193
I swear.

16:41.227 --> 16:45.313
Look, I know the situation's...
really complicated...

16:45.365 --> 16:46.431
Tessa...

16:46.466 --> 16:47.966
Just give it another minute,
Ms. Ainsley.

16:51.704 --> 16:54.473
I will get you a glass of milk
while you wait.

16:57.910 --> 17:01.079
Thanks, Noah.
You have a real gift.

17:01.113 --> 17:03.165
Thanks for recognizing it.

17:04.500 --> 17:09.171
I can't believe I thought
I was in love with George.

17:09.222 --> 17:10.888
I mean, you get past
the good looks,

17:10.923 --> 17:12.557
and he's got nothing.

17:12.592 --> 17:13.625
Yeah.

17:13.643 --> 17:16.694
He is so not my type.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.300
I'm married.

17:26.071 --> 17:27.305
Married?

17:28.741 --> 17:32.277
You creep! Whenever I start
to feel something!

17:32.311 --> 17:34.696
Whenever I... start...
to <i>feel...</i>

17:36.749 --> 17:38.583
Dallas! Hey.

17:38.618 --> 17:40.151
I thought you weren't
going to be able to make it.

17:40.169 --> 17:42.721
Fate had other plans, plus they
couldn't de-ice the plane.

17:42.755 --> 17:45.757
George,
thank you for the mittens.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.059
I can't believe
you remembered.

17:47.093 --> 17:48.260
Rem-remembered?

17:48.294 --> 17:50.345
That story about how my mother
used to make me wear

17:50.379 --> 17:52.547
bright red mittens every year
so they wouldn't get lost

17:52.598 --> 17:54.666
in the snow. Oh.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.936
The fact that you remembered
really... touched me.

17:57.970 --> 17:59.104
Oh.

17:59.138 --> 18:00.205
It almost made me cry.

18:00.239 --> 18:03.191
Thanks, George!
See you new year's!

18:03.226 --> 18:05.677
Bye-bye. Merry Christmas, guys.
Thanks for coming.

18:05.695 --> 18:06.945
- Merry Christmas.
- Right. So the red mittens

18:06.979 --> 18:08.346
were kind of a stock present
this year.

18:08.381 --> 18:11.249
Oh, gosh.
I'm embarrassed.

18:11.284 --> 18:12.567
What? No.

18:12.618 --> 18:15.387
Don't be. You know what?
I think, subconsciously,

18:15.421 --> 18:18.523
I remembered you telling me
that story that...

18:31.003 --> 18:32.337
Oh.

18:34.006 --> 18:36.041
Dallas, are we, uh...

18:37.777 --> 18:39.411
Uh, are we...

18:39.445 --> 18:44.116
- Lighten up, George.
- It's Christmas.

18:51.023 --> 18:53.492
Let me get this right.

18:53.526 --> 18:56.244
You invite me over here to hang
out in some lousy cloak closet

18:56.279 --> 18:59.230
while you make out
with not one but <i>two</i> women!

18:59.248 --> 19:00.499
<i>George had a gift, all right...</i>

19:00.533 --> 19:02.951
<i>A gift for making even</i>
<i>the sanest women turn crazy.</i>

19:03.002 --> 19:06.638
And good thing I wasn't thirsty,
'cause that milk never came!

19:06.672 --> 19:08.773
Aah! Ugh!

19:10.610 --> 19:13.261
Happy holidays.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.640
<i>Damn,</i> Mrs. Yee.
You got it goin' on. Mmm.

19:25.691 --> 19:27.609
- Idiot!
- Jeez! Zoe, please!

19:27.643 --> 19:30.812
Come on, listen to the sound...
Sound of my voice.

19:30.863 --> 19:32.814
Stop throwing snowballs.

19:32.865 --> 19:34.316
I was a sure thing!

19:34.367 --> 19:35.500
Oh!

19:51.017 --> 19:53.752
Hey. I'm sorry I told you

19:53.786 --> 19:55.387
I broke up with Zoe
because of you.

19:55.421 --> 20:00.559
It was just... I didn't want
you to be mad at me anymore.

20:00.593 --> 20:04.696
I mean, you're really good
at the ice treatment.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.932
Thanks.

20:06.966 --> 20:11.169
And I guess I shouldn't
have snuck on your computer.

20:11.204 --> 20:13.805
You should probably
password-protect.

20:13.839 --> 20:16.241
Will do.

20:16.275 --> 20:21.313
Well, I guess we both learned
a valuable lesson.

20:21.347 --> 20:23.181
I'm sorry you don't have
a special someone

20:23.216 --> 20:25.050
to share the holidays with,
George.

20:25.084 --> 20:26.885
What? Are you kidding?

20:26.919 --> 20:29.120
Yeah, but I'm your kid.

20:29.155 --> 20:31.489
Don't you get sick of it
just being the two of us?

20:31.507 --> 20:33.258
Never.

20:33.292 --> 20:35.527
That said...

20:35.561 --> 20:37.528
If there were ever
to be a third,

20:37.546 --> 20:40.065
I hope you'd be able
to embrace that person

20:40.099 --> 20:41.299
with open arms.

20:41.334 --> 20:44.002
I would.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.370
And vice versa.

20:45.404 --> 20:47.339
Let's face it, George.

20:47.373 --> 20:51.209
I tried to help you,
but with your track record,

20:51.244 --> 20:54.279
it's probably gonna be me
before it's you.
