WEBVTT

00:08.299 --> 00:10.969
So… how was last night?

00:11.052 --> 00:13.221
Did you break up with your boyfriend?

00:13.304 --> 00:14.973
Aren't you just dying to know?

00:15.056 --> 00:17.225
Oh, I'm on pins and needles.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.605
Well, he took me
to one of those fancy places

00:22.689 --> 00:24.107
where you order at the table.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.904
Wow!

00:30.989 --> 00:33.283
He spoils you.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.909
Well, he can afford it.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.996
I don't know if I mentioned this,
but he's kind of a local celebrity.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.372
Is it Gary Storm?

00:39.956 --> 00:42.625
The weather guy on Channel 2 news?
I love his bow ties.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.503
Gary Storm died in a tornado.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.590
You're thinking of Johnny Thunder.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.052
Oh my God! You're dating Johnny Thunder?

00:52.635 --> 00:55.138
No, no. My guy's not a weatherman.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.433
He's got a bunch of salons.
You may have seen his commercials.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.028
Where's the hair?

01:10.111 --> 01:10.945
There's the hair.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.030
There's the hair.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.115
Where's the hair?

01:14.616 --> 01:15.450
There's the hair.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.451
There's the hair.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.577
There's the hair.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.162
Explosion.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.503
<i>Chez Fez, where every day</i>
<i>is a good hair day.</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:28.254
I said, good day.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.342
You're dating Fez?

01:33.510 --> 01:34.552
You know Fez?

01:35.136 --> 01:37.639
Oh, we know Fez.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.225
-<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

01:51.861 --> 01:53.905
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

01:59.702 --> 02:01.579
Do they know you guys are here?

02:01.663 --> 02:02.664
Oh, they don't care.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.290
They're in the zone.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.917
Nothing breaks it.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.502
Watch this.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.343
How can she kiss my brother?
His dentist quit in the middle of an exam.

02:16.803 --> 02:17.762
Guys.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.014
I got too close, and now I'm stuck in it.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.560
We've all been there.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.520
When you're in the middle of
a make out session,

02:25.603 --> 02:26.813
and you're in the moment.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.648
And your lips just melt together.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.943
And his tongue hits the hangy thing
in the back of your throat

02:32.026 --> 02:33.862
and it feels <i>so </i>good.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.280
What?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.532
The… uvula.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.326
The U-spot?

02:40.910 --> 02:42.453
Leia, have you ever kissed anyone?

02:42.537 --> 02:44.164
Never. Not once.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.915
It's just never happened, okay?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.418
In sixth grade, I was a foot taller
than all the other boys.

02:48.501 --> 02:52.088
And just when they got up to mouth level,
I did two years of advanced braces.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.423
Like headgear?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.133
It was so much worse.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.969
There was a crank
my parents had to tighten every night.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.722
It was like starting an old-timey car.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.057
Well, it was worth it.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.560
You have such a beautiful smile.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.020
Do you ever take a day off?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.064
I wanna kiss someone.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.941
I think about it all the time.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.402
What's it like?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.655
Okay. This is an emergency.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.449
We need to get you your first kiss.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.784
Let's go to the mall and knock this out.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.120
The mall?
Oh, don't make me start on a mannequin.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.830
That's so embarrassing!

03:25.914 --> 03:28.333
No. It's full of guys.

03:28.416 --> 03:32.712
We'll find some goober, chat him up,
show him your teeth, lay one on him.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.132
I don't want my first kiss
to be with a goober.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.217
You're right.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.094
We should just wait until
you're confident enough,

03:40.178 --> 03:42.597
emotionally ready, secure in who you are--

03:42.680 --> 03:44.766
Okay, okay! Mall.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.936
Summer of our first kiss. Right, Ozzie?

03:48.519 --> 03:50.855
Don't lump me in with you,
you mouth virgin.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.441
I have Etienne.

03:53.524 --> 03:57.779
Bro, I wanna support you, but you gotta
stop with the fake Canadian boyfriend.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.197
Oh, he's real as hell.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.410
My parents took me
to see<i> Phantom of the Opera </i>in Montreal.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.622
And I met the cutest guy… Etienne.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.335
We were both reaching for
the last kids' XL souvenir sweatshirt.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.711
And he let me keep it.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.129
We've never seen the sweatshirt.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.300
Whatever. You wouldn't know romance
if it threw acid in your face,

04:19.384 --> 04:22.136
forcing you into a life of solitude,
composing the music of the night.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.847
God, I hope he's real.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.435
When did you guys get here?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.480
We were making out.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.695
Fez was one of Eric's friends.

04:38.778 --> 04:42.156
He started out
as a foreign exchange student, but…

04:43.032 --> 04:46.536
then I guess someone forgot
to exchange him back.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.039
Where is he from?

04:55.336 --> 04:57.714
I hear it's just lovely there.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.928
So, what did he say when you told him
you didn't wanna see him anymore?

05:04.679 --> 05:06.055
I didn't get that far.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.890
I mean, I tried.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.685
I told him it was over, and he said…

05:11.269 --> 05:13.479
Over, under. I don't care.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.280
I'm flexible, baby.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.159
So I said,
"I'm trying to focus on myself."

05:26.784 --> 05:28.494
I understand!

05:31.289 --> 05:33.791
And I'd like to watch you.
Watch you focus on yourself.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.837
And then I said, "We gotta
act like adults here. We gotta talk."

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
I can't.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.677
My mouth is full.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.475
He sucked off two of my Lee Press Ons.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.855
Well…

05:55.938 --> 05:58.274
He's got a strong tongue. That's fine.

05:59.150 --> 06:03.112
No. He really is a lovely guy,
and he obviously likes you.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.114
Maybe see where it goes.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.992
Kitty, I really took
all that advice you gave me to heart.

06:08.076 --> 06:12.413
I need to stop jumping from guy to guy
and focus on myself for a while.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.042
Darn it. That was good advice.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.838
I don't know what to do.
Normally, when I break up with a guy,

06:20.922 --> 06:23.091
I just tell the parole officer
to check his pee,

06:23.174 --> 06:24.717
and it takes care of itself, you know?

06:27.303 --> 06:30.139
Why don't I go talk to him?
Maybe I can let him down easy.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.185
Oh good. 'Cause if I do it,
I'm definitely gonna sleep with him again.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.688
What? I was trying to focus on myself,

06:37.772 --> 06:40.525
and last night myself wanted
to have sex with that guy, so…

06:43.361 --> 06:44.821
Welcome back to Chez Fez.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.033
It's always an honor
to have your hair in my chair.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.661
Well, I love coming here.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.955
I'm always so happy
to see how well you're doing.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.250
I mean, free Tootsie Rolls.
Are you made of money?

06:57.875 --> 06:59.627
Yes. Can you believe it?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.131
I tell you, Ms. Kitty. I love my life.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.884
My business is booming.
I have the waist of Linda Evangelista.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.013
And, as you know,

07:11.848 --> 07:13.141
I have taken a lover.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.852
Actually,

07:15.935 --> 07:18.563
I wanted to talk to you about Sherri.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.065
Oh yeah. She's so beautiful, right?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.860
She's warm and gooey,
like a chicken pot pie.

07:24.819 --> 07:25.820
Uh-huh.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.657
-But--
-Oh, and don't get me started on her butt.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.578
It's like the eighth
and ninth Wonder of the World.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.791
Ms. Kitty, I haven't felt this way
about a woman since, uh…

07:39.834 --> 07:41.836
-Jackie.

07:41.919 --> 07:42.962
Yes!

07:43.629 --> 07:45.298
Whatever happened between you two?

07:45.381 --> 07:46.591
Oh, Ms. Kitty!

07:51.137 --> 07:52.930
We were at Hedonism Resort.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.099
In <i>Hamaica.</i>

07:56.684 --> 07:58.561
And I caught her on the phone one night…

08:01.647 --> 08:02.940
…with Michael.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.026
Kelso?

08:05.109 --> 08:06.194
Dukakis.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.778
Yes, of course Kelso!

08:11.908 --> 08:12.825
She left me there.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.621
And I spent the next five days
getting kicked out of hot tubs

08:16.704 --> 08:18.206
for talking too much.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.751
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.337
Oh, but that is the past.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.881
And Sherri is my future.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.425
You know, Ms. Kitty,

08:30.635 --> 08:33.930
when I'm with her… I'm no longer a man.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.391
I'm like a little boy
seeing the world for the first time.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.936
Don't get me wrong, I still have

08:40.019 --> 08:43.064
the voice of a man and the… hips of a man

08:43.147 --> 08:45.691
and, uh… the mouth of a man.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.945
It's very confusing.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.659
But when I hold her in my arms…

08:56.202 --> 08:57.370
Oh, Ms. Kitty.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.832
It's like the world just melts away…

09:04.502 --> 09:05.586
and there's only us,

09:06.420 --> 09:07.421
for eternity.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.634
I'm sorry, Ms. Kitty.
What were you saying?

09:11.717 --> 09:12.843
I was saying…

09:13.719 --> 09:16.055
-I love love!
-Oh!

09:16.973 --> 09:19.350
Don't ever let her go!

09:23.729 --> 09:25.481
Thanks for the ride, Grandpa.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.943
Any time you kids wanna
get out of my house, I'll drive you.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.570
This shouldn't take too long.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.946
You guys need anything?

09:32.029 --> 09:33.447
A miracle.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.324
Fine.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.994
I'll be right over here, reading my paper.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.836
You have great taste.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.213
This is the new ionic massage chair.

09:49.297 --> 09:53.175
-Let me show you some of the features.
-Look. I know you're just doing your job.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.678
But go do it over there.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.806
Any place that's not here.

10:00.057 --> 10:03.102
You are gonna have to do
better than that to get rid of me.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.106
It's got variable speeds,
Corinthian leather,

10:07.189 --> 10:11.485
and if you turn that frown upside-down,
I'll throw in same-day delivery.

10:11.569 --> 10:15.239
I'm about to same-day deliver
your ass into that planter if you…

10:16.574 --> 10:18.367
Oh…

10:19.785 --> 10:21.662
Sweet Lord.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.166
This chair's got fingers!

10:26.292 --> 10:28.961
All I need is, like, a credit card.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.256
Just make it happen.

10:34.759 --> 10:35.926
I'm really nervous.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.137
My back sweat's
being funneled right into my butt.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.973
That's just your body
getting ready for romance.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.185
You're cute, you're smart,
and you're awesome. You can do this.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.188
It's a total sausage fest.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.399
Yeah, look at all these guys.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.194
No. Hickory Farms is giving out
free samples.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.154
Etienne loves a nice smoked Gouda.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.950
-Fine. If he's real, what's his last name?
-St. Bernard.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.494
-What school?
-St. Bernard's.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.496
-Does he have any pets?
-Bichon Frisé.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.289
Wait. That reminds me.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.292
I've given CPR to a dog.
Does that count as a kiss?

11:09.585 --> 11:12.171
-Go. You got this!

11:12.254 --> 11:14.423
I'd like two scoops. Of you.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.425
I'm sorry.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.554
Hey, sexy. You eatin' grapes?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.765
Yeah, because he's nine.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.102
I'm so sorry. My dad has that shirt!

11:32.108 --> 11:34.318
Ma'am, you are not allowed
behind the counter.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.277
I don't care anymore.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.905
Now put down the scooper,
and let's do this.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.950
You don't have to make this so difficult!

11:43.035 --> 11:43.953
Got away.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.872
-Okay!
-You kids need to leave.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.291
You don't happen
to have a son my age, do you?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.212
So it went well?

11:54.296 --> 11:56.215
No. Let's go. Where's Gwen?

11:57.216 --> 11:58.926
Gwen, let's bounce.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.554
Gwen!

12:03.431 --> 12:05.349
Bye, Kevin. That was fun.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.892
Best day of my life.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.185
Calm down, Kevin.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.228
Okay.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.271
Seriously?

12:10.354 --> 12:11.856
One of us had to get some.

12:17.111 --> 12:20.906
Babe, I think you might be having
a reaction to one of my Lip Smackers.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.700
Really?

12:22.783 --> 12:23.826
I feel fine.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.414
Yeah, it looks fine.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.877
That was a disaster.
And I'm on a list now, so I can't go back.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.880
-What if I need new shoes?
-What do you mean, "what if"?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.216
Whoa, gross.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.469
Why does your mouth
look like a monkey's ass?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.137
A monkey's ass?

12:44.263 --> 12:46.432
Like, in a good or bad way?

12:47.016 --> 12:49.351
Come on. We should probably
get you to the urgent care.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.686
You said it wasn't bad.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.773
I was just comfortable,
and I didn't wanna get up.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.693
Oh my God. I'm at the mall
throwing myself at randos.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.488
Meanwhile, they're making out so much,
his lips revolted.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.072
What's wrong with me?

13:02.156 --> 13:04.617
Doesn't anyone want
to lick these $2,000 teeth?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.369
Wow. Okay.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.165
Well, there is another idea,
but I didn't wanna bring it up

13:11.248 --> 13:13.501
because it feels
kinda weird and desperate.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.085
I think we're there.

13:16.712 --> 13:17.880
You could kiss Jay.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.382
He's cute. He's always flirting with you.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.052
Plus, he's a Kelso.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.553
So? What does that mean?

13:25.137 --> 13:26.138
He's a man-whore.

13:26.972 --> 13:27.890
Oh.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.893
As great as that sounds, I'm gonna pass.

13:30.976 --> 13:34.146
Plus, he's our friend. It's too awkward.
There's gotta be someone else.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.607
There's always Town Pool Ricky.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.485
Oh great, a lifeguard. That's hot.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.613
No, he just hangs out
and collects the floating Band-Aids.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.658
But he's single and ready to mingle.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.576
At least that's what his shirt says.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.954
So Jay?

13:50.704 --> 13:51.705
Jay, it is.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.335
Red, I'm not sure
about this massage chair.

13:56.418 --> 14:00.047
We said we wouldn't change anything
in case one of us went blind.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.884
I'm sorry, gorgeous.

14:05.386 --> 14:10.891
The last thing I wanna do
is stress you out or upset you.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.895
Are you feeling okay?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.730
I'm awesome.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.485
Kitty, you did a terrible job with Fez.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.904
He told me he loved me.
What did you say to him?

14:23.988 --> 14:28.325
I… I'm an older lady.
I can't recall the exact words.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.996
Kitty. He talked about a life together.
He started crying.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.748
Then he got his mom on the phone.
She started crying.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.500
Honey.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.252
Sherri's here.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.965
I know she is. I'm not sure you are.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.967
Good one, babe.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.765
I'm sorry. I just… I got…
I got swept up in the moment.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.309
He's so sweet.

14:53.392 --> 14:58.731
And his words sound like
a romance novel that I barely understand.

14:59.523 --> 15:02.151
What am I gonna do?
This guy is undumpable.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.111
Well, clearly, I can't hack it.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.322
We need someone who is just ruthless.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.115
Who will go straight for the jugular.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.992
An ax murderer.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.121
Red, honey?

15:16.373 --> 15:18.167
Should we get a cat?

15:19.668 --> 15:24.548
Just something warm to have right here,

15:24.632 --> 15:27.551
while I'm… chillin'.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.597
Chair, I need to talk to the real Red.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.059
Damn it, Kitty!

15:36.560 --> 15:38.354
Did you have to pull the plug?

15:38.979 --> 15:44.234
That's exactly why I don't put your name
on those papers at the hospital.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.448
There's our ax murderer.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.080
Hey, you.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.999
Where is everyone? I thought
we're meeting up here before bowling.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.711
Oh, the bowling alley's closed.
They ran out of balls.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.381
Come sit.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.882
Okay.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.718
Look at that sky.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.138
The stars are so bright, and the moon is

16:13.806 --> 16:14.932
also bright.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.185
I never thought of it like that.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.355
Kind of romantic, don't you think?

16:22.690 --> 16:25.943
Whoa, you can see
right into that old lady's bathtub.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.570
Oh, she's crying.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.573
I think her husband just died.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.790
-Leia?
-Yeah?

16:40.749 --> 16:41.917
I know what's going on here.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.460
Oh good. Gimme a sec.

16:44.712 --> 16:45.713
Okay, I'm back.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.052
Leia.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.470
I'm not going to kiss you.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.097
What?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.183
Not even you?
Oh my God, this is so embarrassing.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.476
I'll be in here now.

17:00.394 --> 17:03.147
Hey, stop. Don't be embarrassed.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.774
Look. I think you're great.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.236
You're cute and smart and interesting.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.488
Really?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.200
Yeah.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.412
That's why I don't think we should kiss.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.831
Look.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.668
Leia, I just don't want to be
some meaningless hookup.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.003
You know?

17:26.086 --> 17:30.299
Like, if it's gonna happen,
I want it to just happen.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.343
And I want it to be amazing.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.139
Okay, that was really nice.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.725
You sure you don't wanna kiss?

17:39.808 --> 17:42.895
Because my back sweat is
really telling me it's time for romance.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.108
Let's just see where the summer takes us.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.569
Who knows?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.237
It might be somewhere really special.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.458
Hello, Mr. Red.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.542
Oh.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.128
Fez, you're here. Good.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.298
Look.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.635
There's no easy way to say this.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.012
It's over.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.101
Oh no.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.062
That's terrible.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.982
How long do you have left?

18:34.696 --> 18:36.198
-What?
-Don't worry, Mr. Red.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.075
I'll take care of Ms. Kitty
when you're gone.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.370
In every possible way.

18:43.163 --> 18:46.708
I'm talking about you and Sherri.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.211
The two of you are over.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.796
What?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.133
What are you talking about?

18:55.342 --> 18:56.343
Is this a joke?

18:56.426 --> 18:58.303
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

18:58.387 --> 18:59.429
Sherri's dumping you.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.183
That's not funny.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.146
Chin up, kid.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.897
You gave it your best shot.

19:11.108 --> 19:11.942
Look at me!

19:14.862 --> 19:17.197
Look me in the eyes
if you're going to rip my heart out!

19:20.075 --> 19:23.287
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Red.
I shouldn't have raised my voice.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.332
But I saw a life for us.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.544
Holidays, travel, dying of an old age

19:30.627 --> 19:33.714
while making love so we could be
buried together like a pretzel.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.425
Tough break.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.885
Yeah. Really tough.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.471
Everything else in my life
has lined up perfectly.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.474
But the most important part,
someone to share it with…

19:46.476 --> 19:47.311
it's missing.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.232
Here's the thing, kid.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.194
You're weird.

19:57.696 --> 20:01.408
But, one day, you're gonna find
someone who loves that.

20:02.826 --> 20:08.707
Besides, were you really ready for
the responsibility of a woman with kids?

20:09.291 --> 20:10.167
She has kids?

20:11.960 --> 20:15.672
It shouldn't be shocking
that a woman in her forties has kids.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.049
She's in her forties?!

20:19.134 --> 20:21.428
Whew!
Really dodged a bullet there.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.182
I still can't believe Jay didn't kiss you.

20:25.265 --> 20:29.061
It's so weird. Even though things didn't
turn out like I wanted, I'm not worried.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.771
Kind of excited for what's next, you know?

20:30.854 --> 20:32.439
I so do.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.816
I just feel like a brand-new woman.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.818
I can't wait to see
what's on the horizon for me--

20:36.902 --> 20:40.489
Mom. Thanks for the ride, but could you
go get your groove back somewhere else?

20:40.572 --> 20:44.451
Okay, okay. I'll go find myself
at Contempo Casual.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.997
So what's the plan?
Just wait around for Jay?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.333
If he wanted me to wait for around him,

20:51.416 --> 20:54.753
he shouldn't have told me
how cute and smart and interesting I am.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.296
You dork.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.382
I've been telling you all along
how awesome you are,

20:58.465 --> 21:00.467
but it took some guy to say it
for it all to sink in.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.551
No.

21:02.928 --> 21:03.971
Yeah, that's what happened.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.807
Whatever. I like the new confident Leia.

21:06.890 --> 21:07.891
Me too.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.851
Actually, I'll be right back.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.574
<i>Bonjour, </i>Etienne.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.453
I miss you too.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.374
What do you mean
your friends don't think I'm real?

22:16.960 --> 22:20.630
It's the same thing
with these gauche Americans.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.890
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.601
Yes.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.312
Yes.
