WEBVTT

00:03.655 --> 00:05.440
And that's when I realized
I didn't like

00:05.483 --> 00:06.919
the taste of ratatouille

00:06.963 --> 00:08.921
but I did like the taste of rat!

00:10.488 --> 00:13.274
Oh, man, I love the C.I.A.!

00:13.317 --> 00:15.667
Name another job
where you sit around

00:15.711 --> 00:18.453
with your friends
and just laugh all day!

00:18.496 --> 00:20.150
Can it, chuckle buddies!

00:20.194 --> 00:22.761
I need someone who can cry
for a mission,

00:22.805 --> 00:25.503
so we're having
a crying contest!

00:25.547 --> 00:27.418
Why do we need to cry
on a mission?

00:27.462 --> 00:31.422
One of you will go undercover
to an enemy operative's funeral,

00:31.466 --> 00:35.165
act sad, and seduce his widow
to get intel.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.819
What kind of intel, sir?

00:36.862 --> 00:39.082
State secrets,
Bolognese recipes.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.258
I'm just hungry for info!

00:41.302 --> 00:43.086
My mom makes
a pretty good sauce.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.610
Great!
Seduce her and get the recipe.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.004
On it!

00:48.048 --> 00:50.441
Cry?
A baby could do that.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.182
Then prove it, Smith!

00:52.226 --> 00:55.446
Everyone, think sad thoughts!

00:56.534 --> 00:58.449
Lost pets.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.147
Dead birds.

01:00.190 --> 01:04.542
Being too short to go on
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.109
Oh, God, I'm close.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.502
Come on!

01:07.545 --> 01:10.896
No one leaves until I see
one of you big men cry.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.376
Hooper, shoot me in the leg.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.030
I always cry when I get shot.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.337
Oh, yeah,
here come the waterworks!

01:16.380 --> 01:17.816
Yes, Jackson!

01:20.167 --> 01:21.516
Real tears!

01:21.559 --> 01:23.996
Huzzah and shazam!

01:24.040 --> 01:27.739
With this leather jacket,
I hereby name you...

01:27.783 --> 01:30.742
Agent Cry Baby.

01:30.786 --> 01:33.528
I did it, sir!

01:33.571 --> 01:36.139
This isn't a recipe
for Bolognese.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.010
It's a slice of bologna!

01:38.054 --> 01:41.405
This is useless to me!

01:44.582 --> 01:48.369
I hope you pleased your mother
more than me.

Steve, are you banging
an old lady?

02:29.061 --> 02:31.847
What? No!
This is Carol.

02:31.890 --> 02:35.546
She's from
the Best Boy Award committee.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.201
The Best Buy Best Boy Award?!

02:38.245 --> 02:41.291
Handed out every year to
the best boy in the best country

02:41.335 --> 02:43.685
as determined
by the best company, Best Buy?!

02:43.728 --> 02:45.077
With almost the best prices?

02:45.121 --> 02:47.341
Yep!
I'm one of two finalists.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.604
Carol is my official
Best Boy observer.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.867
Her report is
the final determination

02:51.910 --> 02:54.130
before the award
is presented next weekend.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.655
My boy the Best Boy
as determined by Best Buy!

02:57.699 --> 03:00.658
Carol, help me set my sky-high
expectations even higher.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.616
Does he have a chance?

03:01.659 --> 03:03.139
Per Best Buy rules,

03:03.183 --> 03:05.620
observers are not allowed
to comment.

03:05.663 --> 03:08.884
But I will say this...
He's basically a lock!

03:08.927 --> 03:10.929
Actually, I kind of hope I lose.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.148
Why?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.629
The other finalist
is this kid Brett Robert.

03:14.672 --> 03:17.675
He's come in second
the last three years.

03:17.719 --> 03:20.678
Imagine how it would feel
to get that close and not win.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.245
I have a lot of empathy for him.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.159
Explain.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.335
- Explain empathy?
- Please.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.424
Have you ever looked at someone
and felt like

03:27.468 --> 03:29.600
you understood exactly
what they were going through?

03:29.644 --> 03:31.167
Yes.
Olympic athletes.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.647
But only when they win gold.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.388
Say you were watching
the Olympics

03:34.431 --> 03:36.694
and someone broke their leg
and couldn't finish.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.063
Maybe you'd feel
their disappointment

03:38.087 --> 03:39.306
like it was your own?

03:39.349 --> 03:40.394
That's empathy.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.004
Gross.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.701
To the concept
and the broken leg.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.268
I'm picturing
a compound fracture

03:45.312 --> 03:46.878
with the bone sticking out.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.184
Ew, with lots of blood?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.186
Stop being gross, Steve.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.928
It's just Brett Robert
is a great boy.

03:52.971 --> 03:56.540
A-A-And he'll be so hurt if...
if he doesn't...

03:56.584 --> 03:58.934
Wait, empathy is crying?

03:58.977 --> 04:00.152
I need to do that for work!

04:00.196 --> 04:02.024
Steve, teach me how to empathy!

04:02.067 --> 04:03.547
Okay, I guess.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.507
Teaching his father empathy?!

04:06.550 --> 04:09.553
I wish I was allowed
to share my feelings

04:09.597 --> 04:12.295
about this perfect boy!

04:12.339 --> 04:15.733
But I swore an oath
to the CEO of Best Buy

04:15.777 --> 04:18.258
on a DVD three-pack
of <i>Die Hard,</i>

04:18.301 --> 04:20.260
<i>Little Women,</i> and <i>The Natural.</i>

04:23.219 --> 04:25.482
- You wanted to see me, Roger?
- Yes.

04:25.526 --> 04:28.442
As you know, last year
was a disaster for my business.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.270
Your fruit leather belt company?

04:30.313 --> 04:31.836
No, no, that's thriving.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.580
I'm talking about
my air-conditioning business.

04:36.624 --> 04:37.992
Last summer, I got
a little careless.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.453
Damaged some property.

04:39.496 --> 04:42.020
I need your help typing up
a letter to win my clients back.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.413
I can't touch the keyboard.

04:43.457 --> 04:46.068
My hands are too sticky
with belt fruit.

04:47.548 --> 04:48.853
Sit down.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.771
Okay, "Dear HVAC customers.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.121
If you're reading this,
I'm already dead."

04:56.165 --> 04:57.514
No, that's too much.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.084
Here's a hypothetical.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.173
What would happen if I quit?

05:04.216 --> 05:06.218
Then Brett would have to be
Best Boy, right?

05:06.262 --> 05:07.307
Wow!

05:07.350 --> 05:09.831
If you quit
so another boy could win,

05:09.874 --> 05:12.094
you'd be guaranteed to win!

05:12.137 --> 05:14.139
Oh, my God, this boy.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.359
I've seen all I need!

05:16.403 --> 05:19.884
Good luck teaching Stan empathy!

05:19.928 --> 05:22.539
Okay, I'm ready
for my crying lessons.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.846
Do I scrunch my face
like this, or...?

05:24.889 --> 05:26.891
You're not here to learn
how to cry, Dad.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.371
You're here to learn empathy.

05:28.415 --> 05:31.113
We already know you can't
empathize with strangers.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.942
I thought we'd see if you could
empathize with someone you know.

05:33.985 --> 05:36.727
And you know
one very sad person.

05:36.771 --> 05:39.121
Why would I feel bad for Dick?

05:39.164 --> 05:40.644
Well, we've been talking about

05:40.688 --> 05:42.429
how pathetic he is
for five minutes,

05:42.472 --> 05:44.082
and he's pretending
he can't hear us.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.171
I'm just happy for the company.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.348
My girlfriend
turned out to be a catfish.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.132
Not an MTV Catfish.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.352
A literal catfish, Stan.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.354
He's dating a fish.

05:54.397 --> 05:58.488
That doesn't break your heart
even a little?

by the way.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.026
I could to this.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.724
Okay, I want to unlock
your empathy,

06:16.767 --> 06:18.508
but I don't think I can.

06:18.552 --> 06:19.988
Maybe we should try a doctor.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.946
But which one?
We know so many.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.948
We do know
a lot of different doctors.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.429
But I'm thinking
we start with...

06:26.473 --> 06:28.649
It's a very quick fix.

06:28.692 --> 06:32.479
I'll simply need to stimulate
your Super Marginal Gyrus!

06:32.522 --> 06:36.047
Please mark your forehead
for the drill.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.401
I'm thinkin' we try
a different doctor.

06:45.622 --> 06:49.278
Stay still, you wiggle worm!

06:49.321 --> 06:51.715
Sorry,
Dr. Ray is out dead today.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.195
Do you know when he'll be alive?

06:53.238 --> 06:54.675
Hmm, no.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.980
Do we know more doctors?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.417
"Do we know more doctors?"

06:57.460 --> 06:58.983
Listen to this guy!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.180
There was nothing funny
about that guy.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.312
Weird one to end on.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.009
Ugh.
We need a new doctor.

07:25.053 --> 07:28.273
Did you say new doctor?

07:28.317 --> 07:31.407
The world is
a pretty cool place.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.846
-New e-mail!

07:35.890 --> 07:38.283
Drop everything!

07:38.327 --> 07:39.783
It's from that awful
air-conditioning guy

07:39.807 --> 07:41.504
I used last year.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.027
"Dear HVAC customer."

07:43.071 --> 07:45.029
Hey, that's me!

07:45.073 --> 07:48.032
"I was inspired to write this

Why was it so difficult?

<i>Maybe it was my attitude,
maybe it was yours.</i>

07:54.865 --> 07:56.301

07:56.345 --> 07:58.390
<i>that I put my foot

<i>"An overly personal e-mail."</i>

08:09.184 --> 08:10.881
Even better!

08:10.925 --> 08:13.797
So, new doctor,
what kind of doctor are you?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.930
No specialty!
I can take your temperature.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.279
I can do CPR.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.411
Oh!
And I've got a knee knocker!

08:19.455 --> 08:20.761
Want me to give 'em a knock?

08:20.804 --> 08:22.502
- See if they kick?
- No, thanks.

08:22.545 --> 08:25.156
We're actually trying to help
my dad access his empathy.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.855
Mm, yes, I think I can help.

08:27.898 --> 08:32.120
I'm trained in something called
Rapid Eye Movement Therapy.

08:32.163 --> 08:35.297
I wave my hand around,
your dad watches and voilà!

08:35.340 --> 08:37.865
Okay.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.127
Here it is!

08:39.170 --> 08:40.563
Empathy.

08:40.607 --> 08:44.088
That's a left, a left,
a right, a left...

08:44.132 --> 08:47.352
Down, up, loop-de-loop,
and up and down.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.529
One more loop and a hang loose!

08:49.572 --> 08:51.966
Knee knock!

08:55.709 --> 08:57.885
Oh, my God, it's working!

08:57.928 --> 08:59.669
But why are you crying?

08:59.713 --> 09:01.976
It's just the end of <i>Cars 2.</i>

09:02.019 --> 09:03.499
I finally get it.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.806
The cars, they love each other!

09:10.071 --> 09:12.813
There I am,
surrounded by the enemy.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.945
If I don't cry, I'm dead.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.599
What'd you do, Cry Baby?

09:16.643 --> 09:19.471
Just squoze out
one of these bad boys.

09:21.604 --> 09:22.953
- Oh!
- Wow!

09:22.997 --> 09:25.782
You're such a good crier, dude.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.524
Jackson!
I challenge you to a cry-off!

09:28.568 --> 09:30.134
Oh, goodie!

09:30.178 --> 09:34.269
There's nothing I love more
than men with wet, wet faces!

09:34.312 --> 09:37.011
-Cry at him, J-bird!

09:37.054 --> 09:39.579
Show him how real men cry,
Jackson!

09:39.622 --> 09:41.798
Am I the only one
rooting for Stan?

09:45.019 --> 09:46.890
Enough playing around.

09:46.934 --> 09:49.023
Hey, Dick, how's your love life?

09:49.066 --> 09:52.243
Not great, Stan.
I'm dating another catfish.

09:52.287 --> 09:54.158
I gotta stop going to the river.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.899
Dick, that's so...

09:55.943 --> 09:59.163
sa-sasa-sad!

09:59.207 --> 10:01.470
- Hoorah!
- Yes!

10:01.513 --> 10:02.950
You win, Stan.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.952
She's yours now.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.475
Jackson, are you okay?

10:06.518 --> 10:07.911
Just a little bummed.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.610
I liked being Agent Cry Baby.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.002
I won.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.700
Why do I feel sad?

10:17.051 --> 10:19.749
Steve, I smoked Jackson
in the cry-off!

10:19.793 --> 10:21.490
Check it out!

10:21.533 --> 10:23.361
But then
something weird happened.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.885
Jackson was upset.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.670
And now I'm upset
just thinking about it!

10:27.714 --> 10:30.455
That's good, Dad.
That's empathy.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.458
But I wanna cry and be happy,
not cry and be sad.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.548
Listen, why don't we go
get you a nice piece of fish?

10:36.592 --> 10:38.420
Maybe take your mind off it.

10:41.945 --> 10:45.688
Something's going on with Stan.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.563
-Uh, Dad?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.261
Is the salmon okay?

10:53.304 --> 10:55.263
Are you kidding me?!

10:55.306 --> 10:57.744
This is the best salmon
I've had in my life!

10:59.093 --> 11:02.749
Oh, God, I can taste the sea!

11:02.792 --> 11:05.273
Okay, you're a little emotional.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.753
Let's take a walk,

11:06.796 --> 11:08.774
see if we can get you
to stop crying at everything.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.018
Can I take the rest to go?

11:11.061 --> 11:13.498
I don't want the chef to think
I didn't like it.

What are we doing here?

11:56.585 --> 11:57.847
I think I made a mistake.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.501
That must feel awful!

11:59.544 --> 12:01.633
Thank God.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.375
Please tell me you have a way
to take <i>away</i> empathy.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.595
My dad can't handle
being like this.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.597
Of course I do.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.817
I call it a reverso.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.383
They're like half my business.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.690
I really shouldn't be messing
with the human mind.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.779
I don't understand it.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.349
<i>"HVAC.
What does it mean?</i>

12:21.392 --> 12:23.351
<i>Heating versus
air conditioning,</i>

12:23.394 --> 12:25.875
<i>the battle we are all fighting.</i>

12:25.919 --> 12:28.878
<i>But the battle</i> I'm <i>fighting
is with my ex-wife, Regina.</i>

12:28.922 --> 12:30.880
<i>If that is her real name.</i>

12:30.924 --> 12:32.664
<i>Which I think it probably is.</i>

12:32.708 --> 12:34.841
<i>She was nothing if not honest.</i>

12:34.884 --> 12:38.061
<i>She left me when I was 29,
and she took our kids...</i>

12:38.105 --> 12:41.630
<i>Socks, Sir Kittens,
Beezus, and Garbanzo.</i>

12:41.673 --> 12:43.937
<i>That's right.
Our kids have cats' names.</i>

12:45.852 --> 12:47.810
Now that I'm back to normal,

12:47.854 --> 12:49.420
this salmon is not
that great, huh?

12:49.464 --> 12:50.857
Glad you're feeling better.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.641
And just in time

12:52.684 --> 12:54.817
for the Best Boy Award
this weekend!

12:54.861 --> 12:56.166
That's this weekend?!

12:56.210 --> 12:57.820
I totally forgot about that!

12:57.864 --> 12:59.779
I think we all
kind of lost track of it.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.476
But now we remember.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.391
And so do you.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.262
Steve, I gotta ask.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.742
The empathy.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.526
Is that how you feel
all the time?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.485
Uh... kind of.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.140
And the way I felt bad
for Jackson,

13:13.183 --> 13:15.620
that's the way you'll feel
for Brett Robert if you win?

13:15.664 --> 13:16.839
Pretty much.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.754
I don't want you
to go through that.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.278
You know what?
I'm gonna do you a huge favor.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.717
It's okay.
I'm his father.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.504
Do him, too.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.162
Steve, now that
you're empathy-free,

13:35.205 --> 13:36.903
are you gonna be able
to wholeheartedly

13:36.946 --> 13:39.601
enjoy dominating that nerd
Brett Robert?

13:39.644 --> 13:41.472
Hell, yeah, thanks to you!

13:41.516 --> 13:43.910
I can't wait to see
that dork's face when I win.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.868
I love that you don't feel bad
for him.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.914
You're bad to the bone now!

13:47.957 --> 13:51.091
Hey, Steve,
I have some bad news.

13:51.134 --> 13:54.224
Brett Robert's observation
went <i>very</i> poorly.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.183
He gave $5 to a homeless man,

13:56.226 --> 13:58.838
but when I asked for
$5 to buy some Whip-Its,

13:58.881 --> 14:01.275
he said he was "all out."
Hmm.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.755
Sorry, you're definitely
gonna win.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.322
That's great news.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.498
Steve?
I'm Brett Robert.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.673
Nice to meet you.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.414
I hear I have my work
cut out for me.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.763
I'll say.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.636
Just wanted to wish you
good luck.

14:14.679 --> 14:15.898
<i>I'd</i> wish <i>you</i> good luck,

14:15.942 --> 14:18.074
but it won't make
a difference, <i>Brent.</i>

14:18.118 --> 14:20.555
Ha! Yes!
That's not his name.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.645
Hey, Brent, here's a little
preview of tonight.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.125
It's what <i>you're</i> gonna see

14:25.168 --> 14:28.041
as I walk up to the podium
to accept the award.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.913
Watch where I'm going!

14:30.957 --> 14:33.307
Trash talk?!

14:33.350 --> 14:35.875
What happened to
my beautiful boy?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.616
Wait, he must be faking!

14:38.660 --> 14:40.314
Oh, he's not faking.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.577
Yep, I got under his hood
and made a few tweaks.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.493
Now that engine
is humming along empathy-free.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.147
Why would you do that?!

14:47.190 --> 14:50.063
The real question is,
"Why would I tell you?"

14:50.106 --> 14:52.761
And the answer is
I have mercury poisoning

14:52.804 --> 14:54.806
because I pretended
to smoke a thermometer

14:54.850 --> 14:57.505
like a cigarette,
but the end was open.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.770
<i>"Look, I can't fix your life</i>

15:01.813 --> 15:03.424
<i>any more than I can fix mine.</i>

15:03.467 --> 15:05.687
<i>But I</i> can <i>fix your A/C.</i>

15:05.730 --> 15:07.907
<i>And I can fix your ceiling
if I put my foot through it,</i>

15:07.950 --> 15:09.386
<i>which I won't this time.</i>

15:09.430 --> 15:10.692
<i>Can you respect that?</i>

15:10.735 --> 15:11.780
<i>I love you."</i>

15:11.823 --> 15:13.086
Wow.

15:13.129 --> 15:17.655
57,000 words
and every single one misspelled.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.006
That's how you get
your customers back.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.577
I'm glad we got here so early.

15:26.621 --> 15:29.015
There's nothing that beats
shrimp in a carpeted hotel lobby

15:29.058 --> 15:30.755
without a kitchen in sight.

15:30.799 --> 15:34.150
Everyone checking in,
smelling my shrimp.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.760
Oh, lookie here!
Brent!

15:35.804 --> 15:37.023
Sit down!

15:37.066 --> 15:39.590
Uh, okay.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.418
You look nervous, B.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.985
You nervous about tonight?

15:43.029 --> 15:45.379
You're not gonna win.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.120
<i>I'm</i> the one
who should be nervous.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.122
I'm about to be Best Boy.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.558
All right, I'm bored.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.603
I'm gonna hit the steam room
then watch some videos

15:52.647 --> 15:54.170
of fat people falling down.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.280
Hey, Brett, would you mind
covering your ears for a second?

15:57.304 --> 15:59.088
No problem!

15:59.132 --> 16:00.742
Carol, I couldn't help
but notice

16:00.785 --> 16:03.745
that you haven't said what
a great boy Steve is in a while.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.703
That's because he's awful!

16:05.747 --> 16:06.922
I have to tell the committee

16:06.966 --> 16:09.055
that there's no way
he can be Best Boy.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.230
No, wait!

16:10.273 --> 16:12.058
There's got to be something
I can do!

16:12.101 --> 16:14.712
You're welcome to sleep with me,
but it won't change anything.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.453
Then why would I...?

16:16.497 --> 16:18.020
Whatever.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.065
You can listen now.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.808
Brett, do you ever feel like
you really messed up with Steve?

16:23.852 --> 16:25.245
Um, no?

16:25.288 --> 16:27.203
I was trying
to make him <i>better,</i>

16:27.247 --> 16:29.727
but somehow, I feel like
I made him <i>worse.</i>

16:29.771 --> 16:33.122
Well, if Steve's
as good as they say,

16:33.166 --> 16:36.038
maybe you can remind him
who he really is.

16:36.082 --> 16:39.737
Sure, but who is he?

16:39.781 --> 16:43.219
He's the type of guy who
feels bad for losers like you.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.004
I know exactly
how to remind him!

16:45.047 --> 16:47.876
You're not gonna like it.
But I know exactly how!

16:47.919 --> 16:50.009
-Hey.

16:50.052 --> 16:53.490
<i>I have a mission for the real
Agent Cry Baby.</i>

16:53.534 --> 16:57.146
I've been waiting for this
my whole three days!

17:01.672 --> 17:04.501
Thanks for reading my e-mail
and giving me a second chance.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.025
Whaddya say
we rip off the band-aid

17:06.068 --> 17:07.156
and start in the attic?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.290
Just please be careful.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.858
Don't worry.
I'll keep it to the studs.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.122
Now, which ones are the studs?

17:17.862 --> 17:20.126
That doesn't count.
That hole looked like a stud!

17:20.169 --> 17:21.997
Careful, Jeff,
looks like the studs

17:22.041 --> 17:24.608
are reversed in this section.

17:24.652 --> 17:27.568
-There's no A/
-C unit in here.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.589
Jeff, we gotta get outta here
before Tuttle notices.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.093
Run!

17:31.137 --> 17:34.401
Aah!
These studs are thin as hell!

17:34.444 --> 17:35.837
Jeff, fire up your e-mail!

17:35.880 --> 17:38.622
We got a customer to win back!

17:38.666 --> 17:41.582
And now to present
this year's Best Boy Award,

17:41.625 --> 17:46.065
five-time Best Boy and
Best Buy fanatic... Robert Wuhl!

17:48.023 --> 17:49.329
Good evening.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.854
What does it mean
to be Best Boy?

17:52.897 --> 17:54.769
Well, to me it means...

17:54.812 --> 17:59.121
Steve, I just want to say,
I'm sorry.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.819
And don't worry,
I have a plan to fix everything.

18:01.863 --> 18:06.650
And that's what being Best Boy
is all about.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.478
And so, without any further ado,

18:08.522 --> 18:11.568
this year's Best Boy is...

18:11.612 --> 18:12.874
Brett Robert!

18:12.917 --> 18:14.615
What the hell?!

18:17.183 --> 18:20.664
First, I'd like to say,
Steve Smith,

18:20.708 --> 18:22.013
you deserve this just...

18:22.057 --> 18:23.406
Wait!

18:23.450 --> 18:25.408
That's no Best Boy!

18:25.452 --> 18:28.977
Last night,
Brett Robert came to my house

18:29.020 --> 18:31.893
and pushed my grandpa
off the roof!

18:33.460 --> 18:36.941
Worst part is, gramps wasn't
on the roof to begin with.

18:36.985 --> 18:39.335
He lured him up there
with licorice!

18:39.379 --> 18:41.990
How do we know
you're telling the truth?!

18:42.033 --> 18:45.428
I have all the proof I need
right here!

18:49.084 --> 18:51.304
A tear!

18:51.347 --> 18:52.914
He speaks true!

18:52.957 --> 18:55.917
Brett Robert cannot be Best Boy!

18:55.960 --> 18:57.179
But it's not true.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.225
I... Oh, God!

18:59.268 --> 19:01.444
I've lost everything!

19:05.405 --> 19:07.711
Gotta feel a little bad
for Brett here, huh?

19:07.755 --> 19:09.191
Who cares about him?!

19:09.235 --> 19:10.758
He loses, I win!

19:10.801 --> 19:12.542
- You're a genius!
- No!

19:12.586 --> 19:14.631
That's not why
I ruined his life!

19:14.675 --> 19:17.721
I did it so you'd feel bad for
him and remember who you are!

19:17.765 --> 19:19.462
But you're trapped in there.

19:19.506 --> 19:20.985
And the only way
to bring you back

19:21.029 --> 19:22.857
is the Indiana Jones technique.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.554
The Indiana Jones tech...?

19:26.556 --> 19:27.949
Wake up, Indy!

19:27.992 --> 19:29.777
Stop!
I'm faking!

19:29.820 --> 19:31.953
- Faking?
- Yes!

19:31.996 --> 19:34.303
I wanted Brett to win
the whole time,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.044
and when you brought me
to the new doctor,

19:36.087 --> 19:37.872
I realized
I could pretend to be bad

19:37.915 --> 19:39.395
and Carol would believe it.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.484
So you were fake gloating?

19:41.528 --> 19:44.052
I was hoping Carol would see me
being a jerk

19:44.095 --> 19:45.096
and give it to Brett.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.620
Carol, is this true?

19:46.663 --> 19:47.969
I don't know.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.884
But after hearing this,
I do know

19:49.927 --> 19:51.973
who the true Best Boy is...

19:52.016 --> 19:54.193
Stan Smith!

19:54.236 --> 19:55.716
What?! No!

19:55.759 --> 19:58.414
I-I mean, I'm honored,
but give it to Brett.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.242
No, Stan.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.462
When you burned your son
with that torch,

20:02.505 --> 20:04.942
that's when I knew
you were special.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.466
Besides, I don't know
how you knew,

20:06.509 --> 20:10.034
but I <i>do</i> like pushing
old people off roofs.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.385
It's fun.
And I'm not gonna stop.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.995
Don't you see, Dad?

20:14.038 --> 20:16.519
You tried to take away
my empathy to protect me

20:16.563 --> 20:18.391
and then you tried
to give it back.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.219
Also to protect me.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.004
And that is what truly makes
a Best Boy.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.788
Then I <i>am</i> the Best Boy!

20:24.832 --> 20:27.051
And here's your prize.

20:27.095 --> 20:30.054
A DVD three-pack of <i>Wildcats,</i>

20:30.098 --> 20:33.710
John Grisham's <i>The Client,
and A Beautiful Mind.</i>

20:33.754 --> 20:35.712
I-I'm sorry, what connects
those three movies?

20:35.756 --> 20:37.758
The packaging!

20:37.801 --> 20:39.673
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

20:39.716 --> 20:42.676
Why didn't the doctor's hand-
movement therapy work on you?

20:42.719 --> 20:44.939
I think maybe it was because
I was still unconscious

20:44.982 --> 20:46.351
from you clobbering me
with that plate.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.464
Ohh, that's why she said
it wouldn't work.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.727
I-I thought she just had
the new-doctor jitters.

20:52.773 --> 20:56.342
What is going on with Stan?

20:56.385 --> 20:58.082
Have a great night!
