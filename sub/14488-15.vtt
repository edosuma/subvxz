00:36.162 --> 00:39.415

my latest invention!

00:47.423 --> 00:48.466
Okay.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.885
I like how it's not
killing us so far.

00:50.969 --> 00:54.472
It takes any object
and makes two smaller copies.

00:54.806 --> 00:56.516
All right!

00:57.141 --> 00:58.101
Why?

00:58.184 --> 00:59.894

00:59.978 --> 01:02.730
I've been shrinking
and feeling colder.

01:02.814 --> 01:07.068
So now I need twice as many
sweaters, in a smaller size.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.988
First, I scan
the old sweater.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.824
Then we add some matter.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.368
Any old,
useless matter will do.

01:18.955 --> 01:22.000
Now the matter prism
reorganizes the raw material

01:22.083 --> 01:24.085
into two smaller copies.

01:27.005 --> 01:29.382
So, that's where
baby sweaters come from.

I can no longer
face my children!

11:55.549 --> 11:56.717

11:56.800 --> 11:59.345
Without alcohol, the
Benders are dying off.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.061
A greater tragedy
my eyes have never beheld.

Well, into the toilet.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.108
(COUGHS)

12:13.317 --> 12:16.528
So sober, so weak.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.406
Things really worked
out nicely this time.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.702

12:25.162 --> 12:27.790

like old-man water.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.626
Everyone to
the situation room!

12:31.502 --> 12:33.671
I was lying here snoozing,

12:33.754 --> 12:37.258
dreaming, oddly enough,
about bathing in champagne

12:37.341 --> 12:40.094
with six of the world's
most distinguished scientists,

12:40.177 --> 12:41.428
when suddenly,

12:41.512 --> 12:45.349
I realized my bathwater had
been transformed into alcohol.

12:45.641 --> 12:46.850
Alcohol?

12:48.269 --> 12:49.687
(CHEERING)

12:56.485 --> 12:57.486
Mmm!

12:57.569 --> 13:01.615
It's like fine cognac
with a hint of aged scrotum.

13:02.408 --> 13:03.701
How can this be?

13:03.784 --> 13:06.704
I thought the Benders drank
all the alcohol in the world.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.248
They did,
but then they made more!

13:10.708 --> 13:14.378
You see, once the Benders
reached atomic scale,

13:14.461 --> 13:18.632
they began directly manipulating
water and CO2 molecules

13:18.716 --> 13:20.301
to make alcohol.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.136
(BURPING)

fresh water on Earth.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.646
No! What will I
mix with my scotch?

13:39.069 --> 13:40.863
(SLURRING) Hey, you!

13:41.739 --> 13:43.240
Good evening.

13:43.324 --> 13:46.285
Who are you calling drunk?
You're not drunk. I'm drunk.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.078
That's right, Linda.

13:48.162 --> 13:50.622
Water is now booze,

13:50.706 --> 13:53.751

Sure.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.357
That's your penis.

14:16.482 --> 14:17.733
That's my boy.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.903
I guess this isn't
not so bad.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.947
As long as we don't need
to use our mental...

14:24.073 --> 14:25.157

14:39.088 --> 14:41.215
I freaking love you.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.300
And I don't throw
that word around.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.885
I know you don't.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.763
That's why I love you.

Wait! I'm here to apologize.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.817
For your looks?
(LAUGHING)

15:00.401 --> 15:01.568
Nice one.

15:01.652 --> 15:04.405
Well, yes, actually, it is
sort of related to that.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.656
Can we talk?

15:05.823 --> 15:08.242
Grabbing your spaceship
was not okay.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.870
I lost my cool,
and I'm sorry.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.456
In group, I learned
that I tend to be a bit...

Repulsive?
(CHUCKLING)

15:16.083 --> 15:17.292
Sensitive.

So now I'm, like, trying
to work on my attitude,

15:20.087 --> 15:22.297
and project
an air of positivity.

15:22.423 --> 15:24.591
You're projecting
an air of something.

15:24.675 --> 15:25.717
Phew!

You're so stinky, you need
Right Guard and left guard.

we might defeat
