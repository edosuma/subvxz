CHRIS ROCK:
I thought running
for class president

00:04.205 --> 00:07.375
would make me more popular,
change my life at Corleone,

00:07.408 --> 00:08.609
but the more I campaigned,

00:08.642 --> 00:10.611
the more I just wanted
to beat Caruso

00:10.644 --> 00:12.646
by any means necessary.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.482
Dude, I've got bad news.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.350
The entire fourth period
English class

00:16.384 --> 00:17.551
is going to vote
for Caruso.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.553
All of 'em?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.255
Yeah. He said if they don't
vote for him,

00:21.289 --> 00:22.356
he was going to kick the lit
out of them.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.625
I thought having DiPaolo run
with me would help me.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.627
It would probably help more
if he threatened

00:26.660 --> 00:28.196
to knock somebody's teeth out.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.530
That's okay.
He won't be able

00:29.563 --> 00:31.299
to do that
at the town hall meeting.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.201
I may not be able to knock
people out,

00:33.234 --> 00:34.735
but I know I can answer
some questions.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.071
(Duran Duran's
"Notorious" playing)

00:37.105 --> 00:38.606
Take a look at this.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.574
I think it'll help
with the swing vote.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.243
"Swing vote" meant
"white vote."

00:42.276 --> 00:44.545
What's that?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.647
I redid your posters.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.681
We need to take advantage

00:47.715 --> 00:49.183
of DiPaolo
being your running mate.

00:49.217 --> 00:52.386
Uh, well, where's my name?

00:52.420 --> 00:55.189
Down here.
I'd get votes if they didn't
read the fine print.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.390
I'm the one running
for president.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.592
I think my name should be
a little bit bigger than that.

00:58.626 --> 00:59.727
I have another one.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.632
White people at the beach?

01:04.665 --> 01:08.202
No, happy white people
at the beach.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.637
Chris...

01:09.670 --> 01:12.373
Oh, that's great!

01:13.407 --> 01:14.375
Where's your picture?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.609
Next to Waldo.

01:15.643 --> 01:16.677
Still working on that.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.279
I was thinking...

01:18.312 --> 01:19.647
We should
have another opportunity

01:19.680 --> 01:20.481
to hear our candidates

01:20.514 --> 01:22.716
in addition
to the town hall meeting.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.319
So you're going to
have to prepare a speech.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.187
A speech?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.588
I never feared speaking
in public

01:27.621 --> 01:29.690
until I had to speak in public.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.460
No problem, Ms. Morello.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.861
Okay.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.329
No problem?

01:35.363 --> 01:37.831
You ever written
a speech before? I haven't.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.500
Oh, by the way,

01:39.533 --> 01:41.469
are you going to need
an organ player?

01:41.502 --> 01:43.737
Why would I need
an organ player?

01:43.771 --> 01:47.608
Oh, you know, in case
you catch the Holy Ghost.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.244
Uh, no, I think
I'll be okay.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.412
Tambourine?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.546
CHRIS:
I'm fine.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.881
Good luck.

01:53.914 --> 01:58.586
Didn't Ghostbusters already
catch the Holy Ghost?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.562
* Oh... make it funky now.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.786
After trying to find a tenant

02:32.820 --> 02:34.755
to help my father
make ends meet,

02:34.788 --> 02:36.824
my mother thoughtshe had found
the perfect person,

02:36.857 --> 02:39.760
our neighborhood
funeral director, Mr. Omar.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.263
Oh, hello, Mr. Omar.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.697
Oh, hello, Miss Rochelle.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.266
Is this Mrs. Omar?

02:45.299 --> 02:48.269
No, this is Mrs. Johnson.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.670
Mr. Omar and I are just friends.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.706
Yeah, her husband
recently passed

02:52.740 --> 02:53.941
and she's in mourning.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.976
Sure, she is.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.811
Was it... sudden?

02:57.845 --> 03:00.281
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He got stabbed on the subway.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.449
Didn't see it
coming.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.516
Tragic.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.218
Tragic!

03:05.819 --> 03:06.854
I'll show you the apartment.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.188
Oh!
Okay.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.825
Boy, I love this wood.
Don't you love this wood?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.661
Oh, yes, I love this.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.429
We going to get
through this, too.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.830
We going to get
through this together.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.936
So... here we go.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.672
Come on in.
Come on in.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.939
Not bad, not bad.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.675
So, over here we have
a kitchenette

03:27.708 --> 03:29.810
and over there
is the bedroom.

03:29.843 --> 03:33.847
Hey, Ma, I forgot my lunch.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.751
All right, see
you later, Ma.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.592
Oh, cool!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.460
Drew was lucky to pick up
that ten dollars

03:46.494 --> 03:47.495
before the mice
got ahold of it,

03:47.528 --> 03:49.597
'cause they was going
to buy some cheese.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.966
What's the matter?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.769
The speech. I've never given
a speech before.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.838
I don't know if I can do this.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.708
I don't want to get up there
and put people to sleep.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.910
There's no reason
to be nervous.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.578
I've been working
on some bullet points

04:04.612 --> 04:05.446
and I guarantee you

04:05.479 --> 04:08.382
nobody's going
to sleep through this.

04:08.416 --> 04:12.320
"The geopolitical infrastructure
of Corleone"?

04:12.353 --> 04:14.888
"Trading arms for hostages"?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.824
"Postwar Grenada"?!

04:16.857 --> 04:19.593
Good, huh?
I got more stuff, too,

04:19.627 --> 04:21.862
on Noriega and the fallacy
of trickle-down economics.

04:21.895 --> 04:25.966
Wait. "The fallacy of
trickle

04:25.999 --> 04:27.768
Greg, this is the eighth grade.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.338
Yeah, but it's trickling down
to us.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.306
I want a speech that'll get
people excited.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.842
I want a speech that will get
people to vote for me,

04:34.875 --> 04:35.843
but mostly,

04:35.876 --> 04:37.311
I want a speech
I can remember.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.579
I hear ya.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.681
You need a good hook.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.783
After researching some of the
greatest speeches ever,

04:42.816 --> 04:44.685
I tried a few on for size.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.656
Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers brought forth

04:48.689 --> 04:50.758
to this country a...

04:50.791 --> 04:52.926
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.763
Don't vote for him,
vote for me.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.897
Come on. This is serious.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.067
I am not a crook.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.935
Come on. Now you're just
making stuff up.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.505
Once you go black,
you never go back.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.507
Are you trying to get us killed?

05:06.540 --> 05:09.443
Segregation now,
segregation tomorrow,

05:09.477 --> 05:10.811
and segregation forever!

05:10.844 --> 05:12.012
What are you thinking?

05:12.045 --> 05:15.916
I think we've looked at every
speech in every book here.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.050
Maybe I should just say,
"Vote for me.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.251
You know I won't kick
the crap out of you."

05:18.285 --> 05:21.455
We better make a good showing
at this town hall meeting.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.692
Baby, I need ten dollars.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.859
What for?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.728
'Cause I'm going
to get my hair done

05:27.761 --> 05:29.697
and I have ten,
but I need 20.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.636
What is he doing
up there?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.971
I guess he's listening
to music.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.841
Pete Escovedo, I think.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.876
Could you tell him
to keep it down?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.011
I got to get some sleep.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.813
Okay, baby,
I'll tell him.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.115
Mr. Omar had just moved
into the house

05:48.148 --> 05:50.918
and had already made
himself at home.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.856
Who are you?

05:55.889 --> 05:58.158
Mrs. Morales.
Can I help you?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.994
Oh. Is Mr. Omar here?

06:01.028 --> 06:01.829
Hold on.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.897
Omar, alguien estÃ¡ a la puerta.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.101
Oh, hello, Miss Rochelle.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.404
Am I interrupting something?

06:10.438 --> 06:12.673
Oh, no, I was just about
to come to you.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.108
Do you have a face towel
I could borrow?

06:15.142 --> 06:16.577
MRS. MORALES:
Pregunta si
tienechampu.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.546
Oh, yeah.
And some shampoo, too.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.813
Uh, I'll check.

06:19.847 --> 06:24.017
I just wanted to say we don't
have many rules for our tenants,

06:24.051 --> 06:25.653
but my husband
works at night

06:25.686 --> 06:27.421
and he sleeps
during the day.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.023
So if you can keep
the music down
a little bit

06:30.057 --> 06:31.892
we'll really appreciate that.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.026
Oh, no problem.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.027
Thank you.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.028
Uh-huh.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.931
Oh, don't forget the face towel
and the shampoo.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.033
I thought I would be nervous
when I got in front

06:40.067 --> 06:42.035
of that audience,
but for the first time,

06:42.069 --> 06:43.971
I had more confidence
than ever.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.873
Hey, look, it's Frank
and Sammy.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.107
That's all right,
'cause after this

06:47.140 --> 06:49.176
you're the one that's going
to be singing...

06:49.209 --> 06:50.944
* These are the breaks

06:50.978 --> 06:52.846
* Break it up, break it up,
breakdown! *

06:52.880 --> 06:54.081
All right, everybody,
take your seats.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.819
We will now begin
our town hall meeting

06:58.852 --> 07:00.821
so you can get to know
the candidates.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.156
Let's have the first question
for Mr. Caruso.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.759
Yes?

07:05.793 --> 07:06.894
If you were elected,

07:06.927 --> 07:09.196
what flavor would you pick
for the cafeteria Jell

07:09.229 --> 07:13.534
Grape. Grape today,
grape tomorrow, grape forever.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.902
Yeah!

07:16.604 --> 07:18.606
Hey, this is going to be easy.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.907
Who's got a question for Chris?

07:19.940 --> 07:23.043
In a perfect utilitarian
society,

07:23.076 --> 07:24.111
where would a learning

07:24.144 --> 07:26.647
institution like Corleone
position itself vis-a-vis

07:26.680 --> 07:29.049
the prevailing monetary laws

07:29.082 --> 07:30.918
regarding the national position
on the Krugerrand?

07:32.586 --> 07:33.754
What?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.623
In a perfect utilitarian
society...

07:35.656 --> 07:38.125
I heard you, but, uh,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.660
I don't know.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.061
Grape?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.934
All right, do we have another
question for Mr. Caruso?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.503
Mr. Burr?

07:49.537 --> 07:52.105
Where do you stand on access
for the handicapped?

07:52.139 --> 07:56.109
Ramps. Ramps now, ramps
tomorrow, ramps forever.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.049
I have a question.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.851
What's your position
on detention?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.118
Detention now,

08:05.152 --> 08:07.588
detention tomorrow
and detention forever.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.896
What were you thinking?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.164
What were you thinking?

08:17.197 --> 08:19.032
"Detention now,
detention forever"?

08:19.066 --> 08:21.068
Nice going, thunder thumbs.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.536
Oh, man. Idiot.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.772
We'll get him with the speech.

08:24.805 --> 08:28.542
Yeah, now all we have to do
is write one.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.882
While I was debating Caruso,
my brother was debating

08:34.915 --> 08:36.884
what to buy
with the ten dollars he found.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.018
Hey, young blood,
what's happening?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.019
Hey, Risky. Hey, man,

08:39.052 --> 08:40.320
what you got
for ten dollars?

08:40.353 --> 08:41.989
Ten dollars, huh?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.324
Oh, I got this
leopard hat.

08:44.357 --> 08:48.161
Mm, nah, I want
something cool.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.230
Cooler than
a leopard hat?

08:50.263 --> 08:51.932
Yeah.
Okay, okay, okay.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.267
Uh, uh-huh, yeah.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.204
How about an Olympic torch?
Olympic torch right here.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.139
And that's from this year's
Summer Olympics.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.641
And how'd you get it?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.142
Mary Lou Retton, man.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.844
Are you buying or are
you asking questions?

09:03.877 --> 09:04.878
What else you got?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.150
Oh... ah.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.085
How about a wallet?

09:12.119 --> 09:12.853
Snakeskin wallet, too.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.623
Coral, rattler,
I don't know,

09:15.656 --> 09:17.090
but it's from my
grandmama's backyard.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.727
Yeah, I need a wallet
to put my ten dollars in.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.961
Yeah, there you go.

09:20.994 --> 09:21.662
How much?

09:21.695 --> 09:23.163
Ten dollars.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.197
I'll take it.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.667
The Indians made a similar deal
for Manhattan.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.036
All right, brother,
have a good time. Enjoy.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.906
Chris, go get the door!

09:42.783 --> 09:44.217
Hey, Drew.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.853
Uh, I'm Chris.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.755
Hey, Chris,
is your mother home?

09:47.788 --> 09:50.223
Ma? Come in.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.092
All right.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.027
Chris, go tell your daddy
dinner's ready.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.263
Hey, Mr. Omar.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.998
Well, good evening,
Miss Rochelle.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.268
This is my friend,
Mrs. Taylor.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.970
Oh, we know each other.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.938
We both used
to sell Yvonne products.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.840
Yes, yes.
How you doing?

10:06.874 --> 10:08.175
I'm good.
How are you doing?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.711
Okay. So how do
you know Mr. Omar?

10:10.744 --> 10:13.647
Well, we met at my ex-
husband's brother's funeral.

10:13.681 --> 10:17.217
Yeah, got hit
by a bus. Very sad.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.720
Well, can I help you
with something?

10:19.753 --> 10:21.655
Well, I just wanted
to stop by

10:21.689 --> 10:23.156
and tell you
I love the apartment.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.859
Great, great, great.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.861
Well, thanks for stopping by.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.731
Well, we're about to go
and get something to eat.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.432
And I noticed you're about
to have dinner, too.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.101
Oh, yeah, we were about
to sit down.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.870
We might as well join you.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.276
While Mr. Omar
was chowing down,

10:43.310 --> 10:45.345
my father's blood pressure
was going up.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.215
Oh, no, no,
I'll take the big one, baby.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.283
So, uh, where are the kids?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.252
Oh, they're having dinner
in their rooms.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.921
Oh, y'all got any more
corn bread?

10:53.954 --> 10:57.958
Yeah, it's...
it's in the kitchen.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.525
Oh.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.093
Honey? Would you help me

11:00.127 --> 11:01.428
get some more corn bread?

11:01.461 --> 11:03.296
Oh, it's right on the stove.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.899
I really need your help.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.201
Now you see, that's what
I'm talking about.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.170
That's what a real relationship
is all about.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.104
Bible says,

11:11.138 --> 11:13.173
behind every great man
is a great woman.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.875
You're on it, brother.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.209
I like that.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.344
Thank you.
You got it.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.446
Thank you. I'm gonna get some
more of this corn bread.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.848
All right.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.350
Be right back.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.922
:
Why did you invite
him to dinner?

11:28.956 --> 11:30.924
:
I didn't invite him.
He just showed up.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.293
How am I supposed to relax
if you keep bringing home

11:33.326 --> 11:34.161
people for me to feed?

11:34.194 --> 11:36.096
He's not talking about
Mr. Omar,

11:36.129 --> 11:37.197
he's talking about the kids.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.933
Baby, I just couldn't say no.
Why not?

11:39.967 --> 11:41.401
Because I didn't want
to be impolite.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.370
You know I like to make
a good impression.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.873
Making a good impression was
important to my mother.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.009
What are you doing?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.277
I'm spraying for ants.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.211
Didn't we call
the exterminator?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.679
I don't want him to think
we've got ants.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.349
Why are we trying to make
a good impression on him?
It's just dinner.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.219
For goodness sakes!

11:59.252 --> 12:01.288
And I hear you
making that face.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.290
Hey, Mom, can I have
some more vegetables?

12:03.323 --> 12:05.392
Oh, sure you can, son.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.128
There you go.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.330
Hey, what's it like being around
dead people all the time?

12:10.363 --> 12:12.365
Drew, that is not

12:12.399 --> 12:14.267
dinner conversation.
Now go on upstairs.

12:14.301 --> 12:17.370
Oh, that's all right.
The boy's just curious.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.975
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Julius.
Did you want any more of this?

12:22.009 --> 12:24.344
No, no, I'm fine.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.814
Mm, this is a good dinner,
isn't it?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.148
Thank you.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.317
I could do this every week.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.119
Every week...

12:32.152 --> 12:33.954
I'm sure glad I came
down here

12:33.987 --> 12:35.288
before I spent my good money.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.294
You better get down
to the auditorium.
You ready?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.096
Yep. I got my speech
right here.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.198
You got any idea what
Caruso is going to say?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.199
No.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.368
Whatever he's got, it can't
be better than this.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.939
Thanks, Kashif.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.107
I guess great artists
do steal.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.318
How much did that cost?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.386
Don't play with me, Julius.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.221
I went to the
beauty parlor

13:08.255 --> 13:11.258
and found out I lost $10.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.459
And Vanessa,
my so-called friend,

13:12.492 --> 13:14.862
would only curl half my hair.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.964
Did you see my money laying
around here somewhere?

13:16.997 --> 13:19.299
Here's how that sounded
to my father.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.469
I went to the beauty parlor
and discovered that
I lost my $10.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.073
:
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa...

13:26.106 --> 13:27.841
You lost $10?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.542
That's $10 worth of dollars.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.378
Baby, don't worry,
I know it's got

13:31.411 --> 13:32.946
to be laying
around here somewhere.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.482
Drew, Tonya,
come down here.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.350
You sure nobody
was in your purse?

13:37.384 --> 13:40.287
Maybe, but I know it
wasn't one of my kids.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.388
We all knew better than that.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.455
We knew the legend
of the boy

13:42.489 --> 13:44.391
who went in his mother's purse.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.293
Did you go
in my purse?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.395
No! No!

13:48.428 --> 13:49.262
What?
No!

13:49.296 --> 13:52.432
Tell the truth, baby,
I'll let you go.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.201
Okay, I did.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.936
Drop his ass.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.440
I told you
I'd let you go.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.876
Mama, what's wrong?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.544
Did one of y'all find
$10?

14:04.577 --> 14:06.046
I didn't.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.380
He couldn't look guiltier

14:07.414 --> 14:09.016
if his lawyer was
Johnnie Cochran.

14:09.049 --> 14:09.883
Drew?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.284
Was it on the stairs?

14:11.318 --> 14:13.420
:
"Was it on the stairs?"

14:13.453 --> 14:16.289
Boy, if I knew where I lost it,
I would have it right now.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.258
I should snatch
the scabs off of you.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.659
Next time you find money
around this house

14:19.692 --> 14:21.494
you better let me know,
do you understand me?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.495
Yes, ma'am.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.933
Good. Boy done lost his mind.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.400
Give me my $10.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.336
I spent it.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.438
Oh, no, you didn't.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.074
You owe me $10.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.610
Please just get
out of my sight.
Go, just, go.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.348
Can you believe...?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.520
The one time I thought I had
Caruso beat,

14:47.554 --> 14:50.057
he pulled something that
even I couldn't believe.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.460
Men should be judged not by
the color of their skin,

14:53.493 --> 14:55.963
but by the content
of their character.

14:55.996 --> 15:01.268
* By the content
of his character... *

15:01.301 --> 15:05.038
And in closing, I'd like to say,
keep hope alive.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.307
Keep hope alive.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.442
Keep hope alive.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.980
Caruso wouldn't know
Jesse Jackson

15:13.013 --> 15:15.082
from Reggie Jackson.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.417
You can't go out there.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.052
You don't have a speech.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.453
You're going to lose.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.722
I'm not going to win
if I stay back here.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.062
Oops, upside your head.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.964
The next politician
to use that move

15:30.998 --> 15:33.100
was Jesse "The Body" Ventura.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.734
Settle down, settle down.
That was Joey Caruso who's

15:34.767 --> 15:35.735
running for class president...

15:35.768 --> 15:37.437
What are you
going to say?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.339
I don't know.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.409
Well, it was a good run.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.346
Yeah, I guess.
Now I'm going to introduce

15:46.379 --> 15:48.548
the nominee for eighth grade
vice president--

15:48.581 --> 15:52.752
Frankie DiPaolo and his
running mate Chris.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.387
Sorry, man.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.507
Even though I didn't have
a speech,

16:14.541 --> 16:16.176
I did have something to say.

16:17.477 --> 16:23.150
Uh... when I decided to run for
eighth grade class president,

16:23.183 --> 16:25.518
I was running for
a lot of different reasons.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.188
What I never really asked myself

16:28.221 --> 16:31.058
was, did I really want to be
class president?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.525
Well, I do.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.560
You know,

16:33.593 --> 16:36.329
I don't know what I can do
as class president,

16:36.363 --> 16:38.565
but this is what

16:38.598 --> 16:40.167
I'm going to try to do.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.202
I'm going to try to
get you lockers

16:42.235 --> 16:43.336
with combinations that work.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.305
I'm tired
of coming in

16:45.338 --> 16:48.141
to my locker and seeing that
everything I own is gone.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.177
I'm going to try
to get you

16:50.210 --> 16:52.212
textbooks

16:52.245 --> 16:53.813
from this decade.

16:53.846 --> 16:58.518
I've got a textbook that says
Dwight Eisenhower's president.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.354
Who is Dwight Eisenhower?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.755
I don't know.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.491
And what about

17:04.524 --> 17:05.592
that lunch room food?

17:05.625 --> 17:06.593
I had some

17:06.626 --> 17:10.130
Jell-O last week
that was harder than the bowl.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.467
And what's with all the salami?

17:14.501 --> 17:16.336
Did someone vote for salami?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.737
Do we have any bologna?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.172
Yeah!

17:19.206 --> 17:20.407
Ham?

17:20.440 --> 17:21.741
Can I get a slice of cheese?

17:24.111 --> 17:27.214
And if we have hot dogs
on Tuesday,

17:27.247 --> 17:31.418
I don't want to have hot dog
casserole Wednesday and Thursday

17:31.451 --> 17:33.620
and then franks and beans
on Friday.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.621
Change it up.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.361
And do we have to say the Pledge
of Allegiance every day?

17:41.394 --> 17:42.595
It's a pledge.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.664
We can say it once.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.299
What, they don't trust
us or something?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.702
And how about we get field trips

17:49.736 --> 17:51.538
to places where people
actually want to go?

17:51.571 --> 17:54.107
I'm not going to the botanical
gardens one more time.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.444
How about Coney Island?

17:58.711 --> 17:59.746
Or Times Square?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.682
Let's go see the Knicks.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.285
Let's go see the Yankees.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.586
Heck, I'll even go
see Cats.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.424
But if I go to the botanical
gardens one more time,

18:11.458 --> 18:13.626
I'm gonna slap the sap
out of somebody.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.600
Now I know it's been
a long time coming,

18:20.633 --> 18:23.470
but as your eighth grade
class president

18:23.503 --> 18:26.306
I promise you a change
is gonna come.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.145
My name is Chris,
and I'm running

18:32.179 --> 18:34.781
for your eighth grade
class president.

18:34.814 --> 18:39.486
:
Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris,
Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris...

18:39.519 --> 18:42.289
It was great to hear
a crowd say my name

18:42.322 --> 18:44.791
and not follow it with,
"Let's get him."

18:44.824 --> 18:47.294
...Chris, Chris, Chris...

18:47.327 --> 18:49.729
The winner

18:49.762 --> 18:52.732
of the student government
election for eighth grade

18:52.765 --> 18:55.235
class president is...

18:58.705 --> 19:00.440
Chris.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.815
Whoo!

19:18.425 --> 19:20.493
I wanted to become
class president

19:20.527 --> 19:22.695
because I wanted people
to believe in me.

19:22.729 --> 19:26.199
But the only reason I won was
because I believed in myself.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.869
Hey, Dad.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.904
Hey.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.774
Good morning,
Mr. President.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.477
Becoming class president really
did change things.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.379
For one, my family
was really proud of me.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.480
My man.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.883
Now that you're class president,
can you start a war?

19:43.916 --> 19:44.884
No.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.419
DREW:
Hey, Chris, I bet now

19:46.453 --> 19:47.987
you'll get all kinds
of girls, huh?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.690
Drew, you do not use
the presidency to get girls.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.793
Too easy.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.828
I'm really proud
of you, son.
Thanks, Dad.

19:55.862 --> 20:00.300
* Lovely day, lovely day,
lovely day, lovely day *

20:00.333 --> 20:04.671
* Lovely day, lovely day,
lovely day, lovely day... *

20:04.704 --> 20:07.807
Yeah, class president felt
really good,

20:07.840 --> 20:10.209
but later that night
I had a dream.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.955
Oh, my God!

20:22.989 --> 20:25.958
* Everybody hates Chris...

20:31.298 --> 20:35.302
