Huh?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.774
Dude, you shouldn't have
let him eat

01:06.776 --> 01:08.942
That whole pan of acid brownies.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.403
In my defense,
I-I thought it'd be cool,

01:11.405 --> 01:14.406
And I was right.

01:16.327 --> 01:19.953
So, since otto has disappeared
with our bus

01:19.955 --> 01:21.789
And our brownie pans,

01:21.791 --> 01:24.500
Parents will have to drive
their own children to school.

01:24.502 --> 01:27.878
[overlapping complaints]

01:27.880 --> 01:30.047
Well, fewer of you
would have to drive

01:30.049 --> 01:32.800

a carpool schedule.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.053

I'll kill you!

01:36.055 --> 01:37.930
Or your children could walk
to school

01:37.932 --> 01:39.973
So none of you
have to do anything.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.850
[overlapping agreements]

01:41.852 --> 01:43.227
Walking it is.

01:43.229 --> 01:45.771
However, we do need
one parent volunteer

01:45.773 --> 01:47.106
To complete our team of

01:47.108 --> 01:48.941
Noble crossing guards.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.237
Just, uh, one engaged parent
is all we need.

01:53.239 --> 01:54.988
[overlapping grumbling]

01:54.990 --> 01:57.032
Hell yeah! You know I'm in.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.534
I've been waiting for this

01:58.536 --> 02:01.120
Homer simpson. Wonderful.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.746
Hmm? What'd he say?

02:02.748 --> 02:05.666
I was watching the trailer for
the<i> revenge of the nerds</i> reboot.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.421
Homer, you just volunteered.

Dear god.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.300
No. Stop. Yield.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.846
Well, he's got the lingo down.
This guy's a natural.

02:18.848 --> 02:19.930
[bird caws]

02:19.932 --> 02:20.931
Now I got to wake up

02:20.933 --> 02:22.599
At the butt-crack of dawn

To walk loser kids

02:40.369 --> 02:43.162
You notice there's an apple
for sale in the vending machine?

02:43.164 --> 02:45.831
[laughs] I mean,
who would buy that?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.541
[alarm continues blaring]

02:47.543 --> 02:50.460
-Double the coolant levels, now.
-I'm on it.

You, glasses,

02:58.179 --> 03:00.762
Now, switch generators

[clears throat] um, fellas?

03:17.489 --> 03:21.450
I'm the nuclear safety guy,
right?

03:21.452 --> 03:25.287
Shouldn't my console have been
doing all that beepy stuff?

03:25.289 --> 03:28.248
-Yeah, um, uh... [stammers]
-uh, you see...

03:28.250 --> 03:30.709
We kind of made it so that
just my console does that now.

03:30.711 --> 03:34.630
We just figured
we'd lighten your load, buddy,

03:34.632 --> 03:36.548
Since you already do so much.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.633
Like the March madness brackets.

03:37.635 --> 03:40.928
And you're the go-getter
who implemented

03:40.930 --> 03:41.678
Jean-short wednesdays.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.340
Are you guys saying

03:45.342 --> 03:47.684
I've never kept anyone safe?

03:47.686 --> 03:51.396
Oh, sure you have, homer.
Just... By not doing anything.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.030
My console isn't even
plugged in.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.616
I opened it, and it's full
of cleaning supplies

04:02.618 --> 04:05.410
And unsold mr. Burns funkos.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.622
[groans] this whole time
I thought I mattered,

04:08.624 --> 04:10.791
But I don't and I never did.

04:10.793 --> 04:11.875
Well, you matter to me,

04:11.877 --> 04:15.254
Especially since
it's Wednesday night.

04:15.256 --> 04:19.591
Oh. Right. Scheduled sex.

uh, sweetie?

04:31.772 --> 04:35.065
It seems like your light saber
doesn't want to go "shwoom."

04:35.067 --> 04:37.859
Did you go "han solo"
earlier tonight?

04:37.861 --> 04:40.862
[groans] I guess
I'm useless everywhere.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.489
I'm just gonna
stay in bed tomorrow

04:42.491 --> 04:45.492
And suck my nightstand
ketchup packets.

04:46.537 --> 04:49.538
Actually, you have to
wake up at 6:00

04:49.540 --> 04:50.289
To be a crossing guard.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.040
D'oh!

04:52.042 --> 04:54.626
What do you guys think
happened to otto?

04:54.628 --> 04:55.752
-Jail.
-Jail.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.796
-Jail.
-Maybe he just got tired

04:57.798 --> 04:59.756
Of always running
from the darkness.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.926
Oh, god, there's dad.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.429
Please don't let him
embarrass us.

For the rest of their lives.

what to do. Stop!

You just saved this

-All right, homer.
-You did it, dad!

How about one
for the paper, mr. S.

I saved someone's life.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.459

How about one of these?

-Whoo.
-Whee!

06:30.933 --> 06:32.599
The last two endangered pandas

06:32.601 --> 06:35.477
On earth died today

06:35.479 --> 06:37.437
In what zoo investigators are
calling a grisly murder-suicide.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.565
<i> Adios, pandas. We'll see you</i>

06:40.567 --> 06:43.276
We wrap up tonight's
nightly reading of horrors

With a new optimistic segment

<i> Of a curbside celebrity.</i>

07:05.634 --> 07:09.302
What can springfield do to show
its love and appreciation

07:09.304 --> 07:11.012
For local crossing guards?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.807
I don't know. I guess we could
use some new equipment.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.642
These lawn chairs
aren't very comfy

07:15.644 --> 07:18.562
And these old sashes don't
exactly "lift and support."

07:18.564 --> 07:19.521
But you know what, kent?

07:19.523 --> 07:22.816
Keeping kids safe
is its own reward.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.527
God bless that
saintly doughball.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.946
That's it, I'm giving
springfield's crossing guards

07:27.948 --> 07:29.364
An actual budget.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.284
Not for self-serving
political reasons,

07:32.286 --> 07:33.326
But because I'm a man
of principle

07:33.328 --> 07:35.495
Who wants to do good
in the world.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.331
Joseph, your turn

We can't very well play

Volunteering for money.
We're getting paid now.

the best and the brightest.

Well, I hope you learned
a valuable lesson, dad.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.363
Absolute power...

19:59.365 --> 20:00.948
Is the best kind
of power there is?

20:00.950 --> 20:01.866
Is a warm beanbag bazooka?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.910
Does bad things to society

20:03.912 --> 20:06.162
And does strange things to me.

20:06.164 --> 20:10.249
No. Once you militarized
the crossing guards,

20:10.251 --> 20:13.044
They became an army
in search of an enemy.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.047
And if the only tool
you have is a hammer,

20:16.049 --> 20:19.008
Then everything starts
to look like a nail.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.885
Perhaps, but on
the other hand...

20:20.887 --> 20:22.803
-[burps, laughs]
-ugh.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.180
-Mom!
-Gotcha!

20:24.182 --> 20:26.265
Bart, say "excuse me."

20:26.267 --> 20:28.976
[lisa] I don't care if he says
excuse me, I want him

20:28.978 --> 20:30.519
-Not to burp in my face.
-[crying]

20:30.521 --> 20:31.270
Lighten up, lis.

20:31.272 --> 20:34.148
[overlapping arguing]

20:34.150 --> 20:35.942
Must hammer nails.
