10:25.513 --> 10:28.715
Got a minute, Detective?

10:28.717 --> 10:31.017
Trust is a funny thing, Riley.

10:31.019 --> 10:32.719
I did a little digging on you.

10:32.721 --> 10:35.054
Couldn't find much
before your stint in Narco.

10:35.056 --> 10:39.426
You know, you don't strike me
as a Homicide detective.

10:39.428 --> 10:41.194
Well, maybe you're not
looking hard enough.

10:41.196 --> 10:43.796
Surprising, given someone
of your experience.

10:43.798 --> 10:46.966
You graduated from Annapolis,
top of your class.

10:46.968 --> 10:48.701
Served two tours,
with distinction,

10:48.703 --> 10:51.904
for the US Navy
before joining the DEA.

10:51.906 --> 10:54.907
Yeah, I did a little
digging too.

10:54.909 --> 10:58.544
So you just gonna stand there
and interrogate me?

10:58.546 --> 11:00.912
Or would you like to discuss
this case?

11:07.920 --> 11:10.122
How well do you know
The Brotherhood?

11:10.124 --> 11:12.491
I arrested one
of their soldiers.

11:12.493 --> 11:15.628
Then you know their network's
as pervasive as it is deadly.

11:15.630 --> 11:17.262
They don't believe
in territories,

11:17.264 --> 11:18.664
they've got informants
on every block,

11:18.666 --> 11:21.767
and, I'm afraid to say,

11:21.769 --> 11:24.502
in every law enforcement
organization.

11:24.504 --> 11:27.973
The DEA believes there's a mole
in our agency.

11:27.975 --> 11:29.908
A man working for Dominic.

11:29.910 --> 11:32.310
- Any idea who?
- No.

11:32.312 --> 11:33.978
Frankly, it has me
and my partner

11:33.980 --> 11:37.348
looking sideways
at our colleagues.

11:37.350 --> 11:39.784
Yet you're trusting me now.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.920
Like I said,
trust is a funny thing.

11:42.922 --> 11:45.156
Something tells me
you're different.

11:45.158 --> 11:47.192
You care.

11:47.194 --> 11:49.493
And since you shared your lead
with me on the kids...

11:54.299 --> 11:58.135
This was taken earlier today.

11:58.137 --> 12:00.004
What kind of kids steal
$1/2 million

12:00.006 --> 12:02.472
and the first thing they buy
are new clothes?

12:02.474 --> 12:06.210
Maybe they're going somewhere
with a dress code.

12:06.212 --> 12:08.207
They buy anything else?

12:09.381 --> 12:11.348
<i>(Agent Lennox) They purchased
a phone with cash.</i>

12:11.350 --> 12:12.649
Can you trace it?

12:12.651 --> 12:14.718
All I need is a serial number.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.320
Already applied for a warrant.

12:16.322 --> 12:18.478
Should only take
a couple of hours.

12:20.859 --> 12:24.360
<i>(Finch) I'm afraid we may not have
a couple of hours, Mr. Reese.</i>

12:24.362 --> 12:25.829
Then it's a good thing
we know someone

12:25.831 --> 12:27.530
who can hack the kids' phone.

12:27.532 --> 12:30.299
It's considerably more difficult
than it used to be.

12:30.301 --> 12:32.568
I was up on the cell phone
providers

12:32.570 --> 12:34.904
but I lost that capability
along with the library.

12:34.906 --> 12:36.873
<i>I'll have to start</i>
<i>from scratch.</i>

12:36.875 --> 12:40.098
Well, let's hope Shaw's
having better luck.

12:54.157 --> 12:56.225
Ahem.

12:56.227 --> 12:57.259
We at the hospital?

12:57.261 --> 12:58.660
Change of plans.

12:58.662 --> 13:00.996
We're not going to General.

13:00.998 --> 13:01.997
What?

13:01.999 --> 13:03.031
Care's sub-par anyway.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.267
You ain't no EMT.

13:05.269 --> 13:06.668
You a cop?

13:06.670 --> 13:08.270
You got a name, tough guy?

13:08.272 --> 13:10.939
Boys call me Mini.

13:10.941 --> 13:12.440
'Cause I'm big.

13:12.442 --> 13:14.409
Okay, supersize.

13:14.411 --> 13:16.844
I want you to call your pal,
<i>Link.</i>

13:16.846 --> 13:19.847
Get his location.

13:19.849 --> 13:22.450
Guy like you in your line
of work...

13:22.452 --> 13:25.853
you know a killer
when you see one, right?

13:28.556 --> 13:30.258
Hurry.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.197
[Phone rings]

13:37.800 --> 13:39.100
Yeah?
How'd you get this number?

13:39.102 --> 13:41.568
You, Link, it's Mini.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.404
Mini?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.472
The word is you got into some
trouble with the Armenians.

13:45.474 --> 13:46.573
Nothing that couldn't
be handled.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.809
Where you at?

13:48.811 --> 13:50.877
Boys are gonna be there
at Broadway and Reed.

13:50.879 --> 13:53.280
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

13:53.282 --> 13:55.482
All right, tough guy, I'm gonna
make this real simple for you.

13:55.484 --> 13:59.052
You do what I say, you live.

14:05.759 --> 14:06.927
Ah!

14:06.929 --> 14:08.094
<i>Get out.</i>

14:08.096 --> 14:10.396
Now.

14:10.398 --> 14:12.265
<i>(Shaw)</i>
<i>And don't get any ideas,</i>

14:12.267 --> 14:15.802
- this trigger is faster than your first.
- Ah, damn...

14:15.804 --> 14:18.270
<i>(Finch) I've located the
children via their cell phones.</i>

14:18.272 --> 14:21.307
Oddly, they appear to be headed
toward a large law office.

14:21.309 --> 14:23.275
<i>(Reese)</i>
<i>What's the address?</i>

14:23.277 --> 14:26.946
<i>(Tracie) How much further?
My feet hurt.</i>

14:26.948 --> 14:29.181
I told you to buy
sensible shoes.

14:29.183 --> 14:31.951
Why can't we just go through
the front like normal people?

14:31.953 --> 14:34.253
'Cause normal people don't
carry bags of cash, all right?

14:34.255 --> 14:35.687
Front's got security.

14:35.689 --> 14:38.023
We go up there,
they take our money.

14:38.025 --> 14:39.791
But it's not really our money.

14:39.793 --> 14:40.826
Those guys we took it from--

14:40.828 --> 14:42.494
Are dead.

14:42.496 --> 14:43.628
A'ight, they can't hurt us.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.965
[Tires screeching]

14:45.967 --> 14:47.967
Come on!
This way!

14:56.542 --> 14:58.276
Make it quick.

14:58.278 --> 14:59.978
We got about two minutes,
three minutes tops

14:59.980 --> 15:01.480
till the cherries roll in.

15:01.482 --> 15:03.715
I'll flush 'em out.

15:11.323 --> 15:13.958
[All groaning]

15:13.960 --> 15:15.293
All right, T, whatever happens,

15:15.295 --> 15:16.827
don't let go of my hand,
a'ight?

15:16.829 --> 15:20.031
Stick together.

15:24.669 --> 15:25.969
Damn.

15:25.971 --> 15:29.707
I think I made
your friends angry.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.074
That our man?

15:38.517 --> 15:41.418
Man, she got our boy.
We gotta retrieve him.

15:41.420 --> 15:44.754
You know Dominic's rules.

15:44.756 --> 15:47.724
Just forget him.
Let's go after this green.

15:47.726 --> 15:50.027
Little man and his sister
can't be too far.

15:56.034 --> 15:57.099
Detective Riley.

15:57.101 --> 15:58.701
I'm here to help.

15:58.703 --> 16:00.369
I'll get you back home safely.

16:00.371 --> 16:02.839
We ain't got a home, all right?
Not anymore.

16:02.841 --> 16:04.407
T, you still got that
squirt gun I gave you?

16:04.409 --> 16:06.208
(Agent Lennox)
Watch out, it's pepper spray.

16:06.210 --> 16:07.777
I think you met your match,
Riley.

16:07.779 --> 16:09.412
You kids wanna make it out
of this garage,

16:09.414 --> 16:11.013
you'll do as you're told.

16:11.015 --> 16:14.216
You might have
a new calling Lennox.

16:14.218 --> 16:16.718
You got the kids, Detective?
I'm coming to get you now.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.587
Lennox is already asking
questions.

16:18.589 --> 16:21.590
I can't risk breaking cover.

16:21.592 --> 16:23.759
You wanna play kindergarten cop,
suit yourself.

16:23.761 --> 16:26.062
(Agent Lennox) - Gotta call for back up.
- Call on the way.

16:26.064 --> 16:27.463
That Brotherhood soldier
I arrested,

16:27.465 --> 16:28.864
I forgot to mention his name
was Link.

16:28.866 --> 16:30.766
Telling me you're
the only other person

16:30.768 --> 16:33.034
The Brotherhood wants to gun
down more than these kids?

16:33.036 --> 16:35.604
I'm telling you we should
get off the streets right now.

16:42.575 --> 16:45.177
[Overlapping pulses]

16:45.179 --> 16:47.179

[Whispering]

16:58.524 --> 17:01.962
Yo!
That's the new Wii!

17:03.262 --> 17:05.730
Who's place is this?

17:05.732 --> 17:08.532
I worked a job here last week.

17:08.535 --> 17:09.901
<i>(Malcolm)</i>
<i>What kind of job?</i>

17:09.903 --> 17:12.971
The kind it's better not
to ask about.

17:12.973 --> 17:15.939
DEA's office is across town,
but they're sending back up.

17:15.941 --> 17:18.075
<i>You sure it's safe?</i>
What about that mole?

17:18.077 --> 17:19.643
I called my partner, Thomsen.

17:19.645 --> 17:22.422
He's the one guy I trust.

17:24.217 --> 17:28.118
I'm Agent Lennox,
but you can call me Erica.

17:28.121 --> 17:30.454
I work for the DEA,
do you know what that means?

17:30.456 --> 17:31.955
We got TV.

17:31.957 --> 17:33.891
Okay.

17:33.893 --> 17:37.995
I need you to tell me
about the drug exchange.

17:37.997 --> 17:40.764
One of you must've
seen something.

17:40.766 --> 17:42.799
Well, what if I did?

17:42.801 --> 17:45.301
Does that mean I have to testify
against The Brotherhood?

17:45.303 --> 17:48.238
Right now, we're just trying
to make a case against them.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.739
What about the money?

17:49.741 --> 17:51.508
We'll have to admit
that into evidence.

17:51.510 --> 17:53.743
You can't, we need it.

17:53.745 --> 17:55.011
Need it for what?

17:55.013 --> 17:56.913
To get our mom back.

18:02.753 --> 18:06.422
Their mother's in Rikers for
an unregistered weapons charge.

18:06.424 --> 18:08.958
It was her punk-ass boyfriend
that was the problem.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.993
She tried to throw him out
and he got all loud and mean.

18:10.995 --> 18:13.996
So the neighbors called
the cops?

18:13.998 --> 18:15.665
The found the unregistered gun.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.266
She ain't even shoot it.

18:17.268 --> 18:19.035
Put her away anyway.

18:19.037 --> 18:21.002
And you two went
into the system.

18:21.004 --> 18:22.938
We ain't even
in the same house.

18:22.940 --> 18:24.606
Only time we get
to see each other

18:24.608 --> 18:26.275
is when I walk T
to school in the morning.

18:26.277 --> 18:28.177
But if our mom gets out
of Rikers,

18:28.179 --> 18:30.145
we can be a family again.

18:30.147 --> 18:32.214
So that's why you took
the money?

18:32.216 --> 18:34.049
I got research.

18:34.051 --> 18:36.151
Plenty of people have been
caught with unregistered guns

18:36.153 --> 18:38.453
and haven't gone to
jail for it.

18:38.455 --> 18:41.155
A good lawyer.
It's what we need.

18:41.157 --> 18:44.225
I'm talking Ivy League.
Dream team.

18:44.227 --> 18:46.895
But a lawyer like that,
you gotta pay to play.

18:46.897 --> 18:48.630
Upfront.

18:48.632 --> 18:52.567
So you bought new clothes
to impress an attorney.

18:52.569 --> 18:54.735
You know any prize lawyers
gonna take on

18:54.737 --> 18:59.207
two foster kids from the hood?

18:59.209 --> 19:00.841
We get it.

19:00.843 --> 19:03.043
You want your family back.

19:03.045 --> 19:06.247
But stolen drug money's not
gonna solve anyone's problems.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.413
Wanna be the man,
you gotta have a plan.

19:29.404 --> 19:31.171
We're not giving up that money.

19:39.547 --> 19:42.081
Ms. Shaw,
NYPD just put out an APB

19:42.083 --> 19:44.450
on that stolen vehicle
you're driving.

19:44.452 --> 19:47.020
Was driving.
Not anymore.

19:47.022 --> 19:48.788
John still baby-sitting?

19:48.790 --> 19:50.957
He's awaiting the DEA's backup.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.759
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>the DEA can protect those kids</i>

19:52.761 --> 19:54.460
against The Brotherhood?

19:54.462 --> 19:57.463
Perhaps we need to do
what Mr. Elias suggested.

19:57.465 --> 19:59.298
Talk to Dominic.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.201
Well, lucky for us...

20:02.203 --> 20:04.509
I got an idea who knows
where to find him.

20:06.607 --> 20:10.309
All right, let's take a walk.

20:10.311 --> 20:12.878
You're gonna tell me everything
you know about Dominic.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.112
Come on.

20:25.591 --> 20:29.661
Relax.
My friends will be here soon.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.430
You got <i>Minecraft</i>
<i>on that phone?</i>

20:32.432 --> 20:34.232
I got a niece your age.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.266
I'm sure you'll be able
to find something

20:35.268 --> 20:37.335
to play with on there.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.638
You know,
you're nicer than you look.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.316
Kid seems to like you.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.985
Makes me think I might actually
be making a difference.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.486
Let me guess...

20:56.488 --> 20:58.856
You haven't felt that way
in a while.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.259
I could help them, but the DEA
has so much red tape.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.761
Hands are tied.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.462
Till they make a statement
and hand over evidence.

21:05.464 --> 21:08.632
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

21:17.842 --> 21:21.511
Look, I know what you're gonna
say, all right, so save it.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.279
I'm not telling you
where that money is.

21:23.281 --> 21:25.949
Well, you won't have to.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.618
We'll find it anyway.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.820
How do you think we found you
and your sister?

21:30.822 --> 21:32.688
Y'all got cameras and stuff.

21:32.690 --> 21:36.359
Yeah, won't take long to
retrace your steps.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.294
Saying I should make
a deal now?

21:38.296 --> 21:39.895
While you still have
something to barter with.

21:39.897 --> 21:42.732
You've made some
very big mistakes, Malcolm.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.701
Yeah, I kind of realized
that when those gangsters

21:45.703 --> 21:47.236
were shooting at us.

21:47.238 --> 21:48.904
<i>Can you stop them?</i>

21:48.906 --> 21:50.706
I'm gonna try.

21:50.708 --> 21:53.008
But you've already arrested
one of them before.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.510
I did,

21:54.512 --> 21:56.745
but The Brotherhood
uses corner boys,

21:56.747 --> 21:58.180
kids not much older than you,

21:58.182 --> 21:59.748
to get them out of prison.
