WEBVTT

00:23.356 --> 00:24.649
Hey, man.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.715
What?

00:48.798 --> 00:51.676
This is some Edward Scissorhands shit
right here.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.513
What happened, Ed?

00:55.597 --> 00:58.933
Mommy stick your face in a blender?

00:59.017 --> 01:00.018
Billy...

01:03.021 --> 01:06.524
Say something, dummy!
You got a tongue in your head?

01:06.608 --> 01:08.151
Why won't you help me?

01:10.403 --> 01:12.530
Jesus Christ. What, are you deaf, too?

01:12.614 --> 01:15.700
-Billy!
-Man, you are one sad bastard.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.913
This ain't the short bus, buddy.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.710
Billy, you're not ready
to be on your own, okay?

01:25.794 --> 01:26.961
You can trust me.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.590
It's not too late to put this right.
We can do that, you and I.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.746
What do you want, freak?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.823
I had to get to Castle
before they put him in the system.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.575
He called you?

04:03.910 --> 04:04.744
Yeah.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.956
He, uh, made it obvious what would happen
if I didn't get him out of there,

04:08.039 --> 04:09.916
and it's nothing we want.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.835
The terms of the deal we made with him
were pretty clear.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.879
Castle was on his own.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.925
Yeah, well, I guess that's the problem
with telling lies and covering things up.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.302
You can't really trust anyone afterwards.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.764
A lie that was designed to protect you.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.892
Oh, don't pretend you did it for me.

04:31.729 --> 04:32.730
Where is he now?

04:34.691 --> 04:38.278
I, uh, dropped him off
outside the city. Told him to get lost.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.282
Why not leave him
in the middle of Ohio?

04:43.032 --> 04:44.575
He wanted to come here.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.787
Did he come here because of Russo?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.581
No.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.583
I didn't even tell him about Russo.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.378
We'll talk about Russo when I get back.

04:57.213 --> 05:00.800
You can decide on living arrangements
between yourselves. I'll go to a hotel.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.428
Do not leave, Frank. For anything.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.723
Frank?

05:08.433 --> 05:09.684
Yeah.

05:10.893 --> 05:11.894
Okay.

05:19.694 --> 05:23.197
Your mother tells me
you still won't talk to anyone.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.701
How often do you talk to my mom?

05:27.785 --> 05:29.329
How often do you?

05:30.455 --> 05:33.249
I think you need to talk to someone.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.629
Look, I completed
the department's required counseling.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.131
Yes, you did.

05:40.214 --> 05:44.802
And then, twice a day, you went
and sat at the foot of Russo's bed.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.932
But now you want me to believe
you have no plans to go after him?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.225
You told me not to.

05:53.269 --> 05:56.606
What happens when Castle
does hear about Russo?

05:57.690 --> 06:01.152
You may have brought the war
right back to our doorstep.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.904
Are you gonna help her?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.074
Is she gonna help us?

06:06.157 --> 06:09.369
Why are we here In her place?

06:10.536 --> 06:13.039
What -

06:13.122 --> 06:16.250
Because this place looks
like it belongs to a serial killer.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.752
Which would make sense.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.173
Who else keeps everything this neat

06:22.256 --> 06:23.800
I wouldn't be surprised, honestly,

06:23.883 --> 06:26.260
to find a nicely-stacked pile of arms
in the freezer.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.471
God damn it.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.892
Why do you have
a Homeland Security chopper on call

06:32.975 --> 06:34.102
like it's an Uber?

06:39.816 --> 06:40.983
Who are you...

06:42.276 --> 06:43.444
Frank?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.657
You're gonna take the bedroom.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.034
I'll take the couch.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.953
...do so
by contacting the Red Cross.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.080
And now, breaking news.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.583
Police are searching
for Billy Russo,

07:38.666 --> 07:41.669
who has escaped
from a secure hospital facility

07:41.752 --> 07:43.921
and is suspected of several murders.

07:44.005 --> 07:48.384
NYPD says Russo is dangerous
and should not be approached.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.137
Russo was last seen wearing
a gray hooded sweatshirt

07:51.220 --> 07:55.683
00 p.m. on the corner
of Northern Boulevard and 122nd...

10:46.270 --> 10:47.271
Another.

10:47.980 --> 10:48.981
Please.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.578
And now,
a breaking news update.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.622
Police are searching for this man,

11:04.705 --> 11:08.250
who escaped from a secure
hospital facility late last night.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.002
The suspect, Billy Russo,

11:10.086 --> 11:12.838
is armed and believed
to be extremely dangerous.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.008
If you see him,
do not attempt to apprehend him.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.054
Seventeen...

11:22.264 --> 11:23.724
...eighteen...

11:24.975 --> 11:26.102
nineteen...

11:42.368 --> 11:43.369
Twenty.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.164
Pathetic.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.876
How many did you do before?

11:54.797 --> 11:56.006
I knew this...

11:56.674 --> 11:58.676
this recruiter for the corps.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.262
Told me that they like to ask
that same question.

12:02.138 --> 12:06.517
This one kid, he says, "50," or "100."

12:06.600 --> 12:08.769
I mean, whatever. Who cares, right?

12:09.603 --> 12:10.855
What he wanted...

12:12.773 --> 12:14.108
was the kid who said,

12:14.734 --> 12:17.361
"I don't know," or...

12:19.029 --> 12:20.698
or, "More than the next guy."

12:25.202 --> 12:27.246
The kid who didn't know
what he was capable of.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.039
What did you say?

12:33.169 --> 12:34.962
They never asked me that one.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.470
Shit.

12:50.686 --> 12:54.607
Jesus. I can't even walk across the room
without breaking a sweat.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.526
Is that ever gonna end?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.029
You're only six months
into your recovery, Billy.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.492
You've achieved a lot
in a very short time.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.704
Yeah, wiping my own ass again,
that was a real milestone.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.665
We've talked about this.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.751
Be kind to yourself.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.337
Hang in there.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.682
Like the-- Like the, um...

13:29.475 --> 13:30.559
kitten.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.313
The kitten. Hanging on the branch, right?

13:35.689 --> 13:37.441
"Hang in there," it says.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.026
I used to love that.

13:40.486 --> 13:45.115
"Hang in there."
I used to have the, uh... the poster.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.325
The poster.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.577
Back in the group home.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.456
As if we had a...

13:52.540 --> 13:54.583
As if we had a choice, you know?

13:55.417 --> 13:57.545
As if we had a choice, you know?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.630
Have you seen the skull...

13:59.713 --> 14:02.007
Have you seen the skull
in your dreams lately?

14:06.971 --> 14:09.598
-How often?
-Look, I really just...

14:10.182 --> 14:13.769
I hate talking about these dreams.
So can we just...

14:15.521 --> 14:16.522
not?

14:18.482 --> 14:19.567
Billy.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.238
-Billy.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.617
It's like a knot. We need to work at it.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.495
And we need to break it down
so it stops getting in your way.

14:32.788 --> 14:33.789
Okay?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.925
There's this thing I do
with my TBI patients.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.220
They make masks that help them represent

14:48.304 --> 14:50.681
what they want to portray
to the outside world.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.684
You already have the mask.
Why don't you try it?

14:56.312 --> 14:57.438
You want me to...

14:58.147 --> 14:59.481
decorate this thing?

15:00.065 --> 15:01.442
That's exactly what I mean.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.864
Well, I'm not in kindergarten, Doc.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.452
And I ain't gonna finger paint.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.205
Just do me a favor and think on this.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.669
What face do you want the world to see?

16:04.588 --> 16:06.548
Okay, so you wanna fill me in?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.300
I don't think you wanna know.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.010
No?

16:10.094 --> 16:13.681
No, I've probably flushed my career
down the toilet for you already, so...

16:13.764 --> 16:15.516
For me?

16:15.599 --> 16:17.393
You're so full of shit, Madani.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.397
Now, see, I called you when I needed you,
and you didn't do a goddamn thing, right?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.233
But now I'm here
because you need me to deal with Billy.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.320
It must mean that, what,
officially, you're not allowed to, right?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.074
Okay.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.743
They thought Billy would die.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.831
Yeah, he was in a coma for six weeks.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.334
Major surgery where you stabbed him.
Fed through a tube. Bag on his hip.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.211
Brain injury. Facial reconstruction.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.713
And then he woke up.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.842
But they never thought
he would walk, talk, take a shit or...

16:50.759 --> 16:52.469
function again.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.430
And he did all those things.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.975
Okay, Frank?

16:58.058 --> 17:00.352
Russo dragged himself back from hell.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.563
I mean,
imagine the strength that requires.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.647
I don't know.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.235
Billy's. Look at it.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.197
You might have moved on, but he hasn't.

17:14.158 --> 17:17.244
He pretended
he didn't remember what happened.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.830
He acted like a basket case.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.374
He bided his time and lulled them
into thinking he was harmless.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.625
But, as you can see, he knows.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.260
You are all he thinks about.

17:36.972 --> 17:37.973
Good.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.371
Okay, that blood, it's yours
and it's mine and it's his.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.417
Maybe you moved on, Frank.
Maybe you got closure. Good for you.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.377
But he hasn't.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.757
The only closure Billy would have
understood is a bullet in the head.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.760
For Chrissake. You had the shot.
You didn't take it.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.304
What do you want from me

18:17.930 --> 18:20.891
I went to see him in the hospital
every day once I was recovered.

18:21.558 --> 18:24.019
Because I wanted
to hear him admit what he did.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.190
I trusted him just like you.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.111
Yeah, maybe that's why
you couldn't kill him either.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.739
-Excuse me?
-That's why you couldn't kill him either.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.992
-No. Killing him would have been too easy.
-Yeah, or too hard.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.955
That why I'm here, Madani

18:47.292 --> 18:48.919
Just give me names.

18:49.002 --> 18:52.673
Names, places. Anything.
Anything I can use to find him.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.468
You know, I would have thought
you knew better by now, Madani.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.345
This shit never ends.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.597
Trust me.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.914
Come on, really

20:08.457 --> 20:09.958
You got to be faster than that.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.376
Come on.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.962
Come on. Stop.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.839
It's me, Curt.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.600
You good?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.061
So much for the peaceful life, huh?

21:54.813 --> 21:57.399
-What the hell you been up to?
-Eh, long story.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.067
Are you all right?

22:03.405 --> 22:04.906
Shit, man, you know,

22:04.990 --> 22:09.619
why can't we meet up and go fishing
in Florida like normal friends, huh?

22:09.703 --> 22:11.413
You know I don't fish, Curt.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.415
-Have you ever been to Florida?
-Stop.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.916
They practically jump into the boat.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.045
I went fishing once with dynamite.
That was pretty fun.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.922
You see? There you go, Frank.
That right there, that's the problem.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.134
-What's that?
-That-- That modern disease.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.513
-The need for instant gratification.
-Good to see you, buddy.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.182
Not sure I can say the same.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.393
What's with that?

22:35.395 --> 22:36.396
Billy.

22:37.147 --> 22:40.150
If he starts to remember some shit,
I'm his first stop.

22:40.233 --> 22:43.403
What do you mean, "starts to remember"

22:43.487 --> 22:46.073
You cracked his head like an egg.
What do you think?

22:49.785 --> 22:52.579
Yo, they still have me down
as next of kin.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.122
Can you believe that?

22:54.206 --> 22:55.624
Sent me all his shit.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.379
So I went to the hospital.
I had to see for myself.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.672
-And, dude...
-Yeah.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.050
...he was so skinny, he could barely move.

23:05.133 --> 23:08.053
Slurring his words. Face behind a mask.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.973
And he thought he was there
to see me after I lost my leg.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.143
You know that, uh, Madani?

23:15.727 --> 23:19.689
She thinks he's just putting on an act,
you know, that it's all bullshit.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.901
Mmm-mmm. No.
Not from where I was standing.

23:22.984 --> 23:26.988
His wires are definitely screwed. I mean,
he thought we were all in the service.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.407
Jesus Christ.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.700
Talked about you like a brother.

23:32.744 --> 23:36.415
See, whatever it is
that you wanted him to live with,

23:36.498 --> 23:38.458
you knocked it clean out of his head.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.670
And that's the irony.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.340
See, now, everybody but him
has to live with what he did.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.717
And what you did, too, Frank.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.850
-You should've put him down for good.
-Yeah.

23:59.396 --> 24:03.567
You see, I figured it's easy
not giving a shit.

24:04.818 --> 24:09.448
Not caring about anybody,
running from all sorts of feelings,

24:09.531 --> 24:11.825
worrying about nobody but yourself.

24:13.034 --> 24:16.788
Sounds miserable as hell,
but easy, I guess.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.128
But, Frank, I want a real life.

24:24.087 --> 24:27.382
A life that doesn't include me
pulling guard duty in my own apartment.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.675
I get it.

24:37.392 --> 24:38.894
I'm seeing somebody.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.354
Yeah.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.441
I don't know what it is yet,
but she's a cool girl.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.650
That's great.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.196
But I don't want her anywhere
around this shit.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.156
Hey, look, I get it, Curt.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.201
The last thing I ever wanted
was for you to be hurt by this.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.246
-I know. But here we are.
-Yeah.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.334
So, Billy's running, right?

25:02.876 --> 25:05.504
He can't go to you. He can't go to me.
So where does he go?

25:07.005 --> 25:09.341
What did he do last time, huh?

25:10.509 --> 25:14.930
He didn't run. He didn't hide.
He wanted to settle scores.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.892
But if he don't remember us...

25:20.769 --> 25:22.354
who the hell would it be?

25:33.740 --> 25:34.658
Run!

25:35.158 --> 25:36.201
Run, run!

25:41.873 --> 25:46.461
I loved baseball, man.
That's the worst part.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.381
I used to love coming down here...

25:50.632 --> 25:54.886
watching the other kids with their...
fancy gloves and shit.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.641
I thought I was the next Joe DiMaggio.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.978
I used to head back and...

26:04.563 --> 26:06.273
and play stickball in the street.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.861
It didn't matter
that I didn't have a uniform or...

26:14.322 --> 26:16.992
a real diamond to play on.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.159
I loved it.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.496
But Arthur...

26:28.420 --> 26:29.838
he took that away from me.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.258
After my shoulder healed...

26:36.720 --> 26:37.721
I hated it.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.433
I hated playing. And, yeah...

26:43.059 --> 26:44.436
it would hurt, but...

26:50.275 --> 26:51.568
that wasn't it.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.488
Tell you what, Bill.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.074
I think about the shit you went through.

27:00.368 --> 27:02.120
I was one of these kids.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.415
Never stopped to think
about how lucky I was, you know.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.709
The old man
was at every single game I played at.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.127
Every single one.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.550
You know, I wish you...

27:16.926 --> 27:18.345
I wish you had that.

27:19.763 --> 27:20.764
I'm...

27:21.598 --> 27:23.016
I'm sorry you didn't.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.148
-It made me who I am.
-That's right.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.858
-I guess.
-Mmm-hmm.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.696
Made you into the baddest son of a bitch
I ever met in my life.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.114
That's what it made you.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.700
Yeah. Huh?

27:41.284 --> 27:43.495
-Right.
-Right.

27:50.293 --> 27:51.961
Somehow, I always end up here.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.048
Thinking about...

29:09.456 --> 29:10.457
Hey.

29:11.416 --> 29:15.336
Hey. Hey! Let me out!
Hey. Let me out! Let me out!

29:15.420 --> 29:17.589
-Hey, you all right?
-Hey, hey!

29:17.672 --> 29:20.842
Don't lock me inside like that ever again.
Do you hear me?

29:20.925 --> 29:23.219
Don't ever do that to me ever again!

29:23.303 --> 29:26.556
I hate you.
Don't you ever lock me inside, ever.

29:46.910 --> 29:50.705
All's I got's a TV. Take it and go.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.797
I'm not going to hurt you...

29:59.964 --> 30:01.216
Arthur.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.056
You don't remember me?

30:12.227 --> 30:13.561
Billy Russo.

30:15.271 --> 30:18.733
I'm from the Ray of Hope Group Home?

30:22.237 --> 30:26.282
It's like every time I close my eyes,
I smell hot sauce.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.328
I'm never eating hot sauce again.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.163
And blood.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.209
It's got a smell to it.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.045
I never really knew that.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.220
Drink some of this. Calm you down.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.015
Um, right.
That's not really how caffeine works.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.726
Suit yourself.

30:58.147 --> 31:00.817
You know, you should
really get your hand looked at.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.902
Looks pretty bad.
You should go to the hospital.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.292
Want to try talking to me?

31:18.626 --> 31:19.627
Huh?

31:21.045 --> 31:22.463
Tell me what happened.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.216
Um...

31:26.301 --> 31:28.136
I was getting tacos for us all,

31:28.720 --> 31:31.681
and then I was hiding under the bed,

31:31.764 --> 31:34.475
and then he came back in,
and it was just, like, after that--

31:34.559 --> 31:37.770
No, wait. Who... who's "he"

31:40.523 --> 31:43.318
No. I... Look, I really think
we should just get out of here.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.028
That's what Fiona would do.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.447
She'd say, "If you think
your cover is blown, just run."

31:47.989 --> 31:48.823
Who's Fiona?

31:48.907 --> 31:49.908
Um...

31:51.200 --> 31:53.036
I worked for her. Me and the others.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.247
She took care of us,
and we did jobs for her.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.917
The kind of jobs
that got people trying to kill you?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.920
Doesn't sound like
she cared about you that much.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.755
Well, you didn't know her, did you?

32:06.341 --> 32:08.885
And how'd you end up with her,
living a life like that?

32:08.968 --> 32:11.429
I don't know. How does anybody
end up doing anything?

32:22.732 --> 32:23.983
Anyways, um...

32:26.235 --> 32:29.072
the next thing I know,
I'm under the bed in this motel,

32:29.155 --> 32:30.949
and my friends...

32:32.116 --> 32:34.535
My friends are all bleeding out
on the carpet.

32:34.619 --> 32:38.539
And I want to run, but I can't,
because that guy...

32:40.124 --> 32:43.711
the guy-- the one with the vest
and the old-timey preacher shirt...

32:44.253 --> 32:48.883
he comes back in, and I couldn't run,
I couldn't scream, I couldn't...

32:48.967 --> 32:53.554
I couldn't do anything, because he was
literally standing, like, right there.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.015
Where was this?

32:56.891 --> 33:00.353
-A job. In Chicago.
-What was the job?

33:00.436 --> 33:03.648
Fiona snuck us onto some catering crew
for this funeral.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.360
This fancy event thing.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.946
We had to take pictures of these guys,

33:10.029 --> 33:11.864
and I felt super weird about it,

33:11.948 --> 33:16.077
because they were, like,
hugging and kissing and crying, but...

33:16.869 --> 33:18.621
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.552
You don't get it. You don't...

33:32.635 --> 33:35.221
He killed everybody
that I've ever cared about.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.973
How do you think that feels?

33:42.895 --> 33:44.731
So, what do you want to do about it?

33:45.189 --> 33:47.483
Do about it? What can...

33:48.401 --> 33:49.402
What?

33:50.278 --> 33:52.822
They're gone. Dead.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.075
And he wants to kill me, too, now.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.410
Us.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.291
You know, really, what we should do
right now is split up

34:03.374 --> 34:05.460
and get the H-E-L-L out of here.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.503
-There's this girl I know, Shantel.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.630
She's here in the city.
Used to run with us.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.300
She's doing really well.
And she'd hook us up. I know she would.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.301
Yeah.

34:14.218 --> 34:16.804
See, I think you know
that we can't do that.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.434
You've seen what this guy can do.
You know that he's not gonna stop.

34:22.018 --> 34:26.022
You're gonna run He's gonna find you. He's connected.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.944
If you go to your friend,
she's as good as dead.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.781
You know it, don't you?

34:37.492 --> 34:38.576
Then what?

34:43.456 --> 34:45.333
Sometimes, kid, you gotta fight.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.880
You take the fight to them.

34:55.343 --> 34:56.844
You want some coffee?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.181
Sure.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.602
I got it on a timer. Neat, eh?

35:08.147 --> 35:10.191
It's been forever since I had coffee.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.737
They won't let me.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.167
Should we make it Irish?

35:32.672 --> 35:33.673
Okay.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.642
Oh, it's...

35:46.727 --> 35:47.895
It's good.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.317
I went to the...

35:54.360 --> 35:55.820
I went to the group home.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.324
It's all apartments now, or something.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.367
So?

36:06.914 --> 36:08.207
So...

36:14.422 --> 36:16.257
I didn't know where else to go.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.593
So you came to see me?

36:20.303 --> 36:21.846
You expect me to believe that?

36:25.016 --> 36:28.227
It's too late, kid. They took everything.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.688
You're-- You're at the back of the queue.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.528
What the hell happened to your face?

36:45.328 --> 36:46.370
Accident.

36:47.496 --> 36:50.333
Messed with my head.

36:50.416 --> 36:55.338
It's all...
It's all messed up in there, you know?

37:00.801 --> 37:04.472
I remembered your address, though.
Clear as day.

37:08.601 --> 37:09.852
Crazy, huh?

37:12.396 --> 37:14.190
You were a good-looking kid.

37:16.442 --> 37:17.944
It's a damn shame.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.001
You're still here.

37:34.961 --> 37:39.173
Yup. Shitty-ass health food of yours,
it almost drove us off,

37:39.257 --> 37:41.592
but, you and I, we had a deal.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.178
Yeah? You want
a pancake breakfast, find me Billy.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.846
Hmm. You know...

37:47.265 --> 37:48.766
I've been thinking about that.

37:48.849 --> 37:52.895
The thing is, if he is bullshitting,
you'd probably be dead already.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.898
Okay, I'm listening.

37:57.692 --> 37:58.818
Eat your food.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.946
There's a piece of shit
from Billy's childhood, yeah?

38:02.029 --> 38:05.700
He... When he went after Bill,
Bill wasn't having it, so he fought back.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.870
-The guy hurt him. Hurt him bad.
-Yeah, the, uh, stickball guy.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.206
-That's right, he told you, huh?
-Yeah.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.083
Yeah.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.002
Uh, so what about him?

38:16.085 --> 38:17.878
There was a time
Billy wanted to make him pay.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.464
We went to Bensonhurst.
He wanted to tune the guy up.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.092
The guy showed up,
and he changed his mind.

38:23.175 --> 38:26.262
-Do you think he'd go there now?
-I don't know, Madani, he might.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.847
Yeah, if he's angry enough.

38:27.930 --> 38:31.100
The guy's name is Arthur Walsh.
He's got to be about 60 years old.

38:31.183 --> 38:32.560
You know, I, um...

38:34.687 --> 38:36.814
I was thinking
maybe I could do this for you.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.775
-You know, keep you out of it.
-In that state?

38:39.859 --> 38:42.194
The bullet you took
was meant for me, all right? I owe you.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.989
Uh, wow, um... Who are you people?

38:45.072 --> 38:45.990
Shut up.

38:46.741 --> 38:50.619
Frank, I'm gonna do this my way. Okay?
My kind of justice, not yours.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.371
All right, Madani, all I'm saying

38:52.455 --> 38:55.124
is if you get him in your sights,
you cannot hesitate. All right?

38:55.207 --> 38:57.418
-Because Bill will not. I don't care--

38:59.795 --> 39:01.714
Go. Go. Now.

39:01.797 --> 39:04.091
Get in the bedroom. Go. Hurry up.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.769
Morning, Agent Madani.
Sorry, do you have company?

39:14.852 --> 39:16.187
Mahoney, what are you doing here?

39:16.270 --> 39:18.564
I wanted to run something by you,
one cop to another--

39:18.647 --> 39:19.648
I'm on my way out.

39:19.732 --> 39:22.068
Russo's journal
went missing from the hospital.

39:22.651 --> 39:24.403
It didn't turn up in your pocket, did it?

39:25.404 --> 39:26.697
Absolutely not.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.116
Hmm.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.120
You know, Madani,
I had this girlfriend once, Aviva.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.831
I was so in love with her.

39:36.457 --> 39:40.378
It ended badly. She didn't shoot me,
but she may as well have.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.754
Is that supposed to be funny?

39:42.588 --> 39:44.298
I guess not, but just bear with me.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.133
Do you have a breakfast place you like?

39:46.217 --> 39:47.968
-Coffee is great?
-Yeah, sure.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.263
Couple years after we broke up,
I see Aviva at my breakfast place,

39:51.347 --> 39:55.059
and I'm like, "God damn her." You know?
"This place is mine. I showed it to her."

39:55.142 --> 39:59.355
So, I got, uh, stinking drunk,
as one does, and...

40:00.398 --> 40:02.775
I found her new address
and I staked her out.

40:02.858 --> 40:06.445
-Oh, classy.
-I know. It was a horrible decision.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.864
So, anyway, while I'm waiting to tell her

40:08.948 --> 40:11.325
to stay the hell away
from my breakfast place...

40:11.909 --> 40:15.746
I passed out on her doorstep
like a complete psycho.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.373
Look, Mahoney, what's your point?

40:17.456 --> 40:21.961
don't show up on Billy Russo's doorstep.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.754
Metaphorically speaking.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.339
-Or I look like a psycho?
-Look,

40:25.423 --> 40:29.385
if it were me... after what went down,

40:29.468 --> 40:32.138
I'd be using every resource
at my disposal to kill him.

40:32.888 --> 40:35.099
Tell me, what exactly is it
you think went down?

40:35.182 --> 40:36.183
You tell me.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.520
You've been lying to me since Russo
and Frank Castle went at it at that hotel.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.480
I told you then
that Russo was dirty.

40:41.564 --> 40:42.898
Mmm-hmm.

40:43.899 --> 40:48.529
Well, it seems like you moved on,
at any rate.

40:48.612 --> 40:49.613
I'm sorry?

40:50.322 --> 40:51.449
Two bowls.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.995
Wow. You are good.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.706
I mean, you must be the pride of the NYPD.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.916
Now, excuse me, I have to go.

41:21.353 --> 41:24.356
I'll go take a shower, if you don't mind.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.650
Yeah, as long as you
don't want me to watch.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.211
I was good to you kids.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.547
And what did I get? They took my pension.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.592
That was because of your friend,
little Tommy O'Neal.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.720
Because of that prick,
I spent ten years in Sing Sing.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.597
You ever been to Sing Sing?

41:58.682 --> 41:59.683
No.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.144
I worked all my life.

42:02.228 --> 42:05.731
I volunteered to help you kids.
And for what?

42:06.565 --> 42:07.816
What did I get?

42:08.859 --> 42:10.736
I tried. I was there,

42:10.819 --> 42:15.407
which is more than I can say for your
smackhead mothers and degenerate fathers.

42:16.700 --> 42:17.701
Shit!

42:18.244 --> 42:23.624
I loved you kids, and some of you
were happy to love me back.

42:26.001 --> 42:27.711
But not you.

42:28.295 --> 42:32.925
Remember when
you come after me with that stick?

42:37.012 --> 42:38.639
Why the hell are you here?

42:39.723 --> 42:44.812
Whatever happened in your life
ain't my fault.

42:44.895 --> 42:48.107
You can't escape your nature, kid.

42:48.190 --> 42:49.525
I was a marine.

42:49.608 --> 42:50.985
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

42:52.152 --> 42:57.825
And is that what you got for your service?
Well, thank you, sir.

42:58.617 --> 43:01.870
What, did some hajji jack up your face?

43:01.954 --> 43:03.914
Is that why you're here?

43:06.333 --> 43:08.294
Is that why you're here?

43:08.836 --> 43:13.591
You ain't so fussy anymore,
now you ain't so pretty?

43:29.023 --> 43:30.232
How's that one looking?

43:31.233 --> 43:34.069
Pretty good. Yeah.
Uh, just one quick question.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.448
Uh, what's the clock rate
on this computer?

43:39.199 --> 43:41.994
Do-- Do you have any other questions?

43:42.077 --> 43:44.705
Last one. Last one. Promise.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.276
It's 1.8 gigahertz.

44:15.861 --> 44:18.113
Oh, shit, the Punisher.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.281
Uh, what's that?

44:19.365 --> 44:22.284
This guy killed, like, 50 criminals
and escaped from jail.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.912
And everybody thought he was dead,
but he wasn't.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.081
I mean, dude was a total badass.

44:27.164 --> 44:28.165
Was?

44:28.248 --> 44:30.417
Yeah, I think he's dead
for real this time.

44:32.628 --> 44:35.047
Uh, thanks for the info, Mark.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.675
-So, this is a great computer.
-Mmm-hmm.

44:37.758 --> 44:41.220
-Yeah. How much is it?
-Uh, 999, plus tax.

44:41.303 --> 44:42.971
Would you take 700?

44:43.055 --> 44:45.641
This isn't an Arabian bazaar.

44:46.558 --> 44:47.768
That's racist.

45:48.412 --> 45:49.496
Shit.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.713
What the hell, Mahoney

46:05.888 --> 46:07.264
You okay?

46:07.347 --> 46:09.266
Shit, that hurts.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.811
Yeah, try taking one in the head.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.939
I could have your badge for this.

46:16.023 --> 46:19.401
You snuck up on a law enforcement officer
at a crime scene. That's on you.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.278
You knew Russo would be here.

46:21.361 --> 46:23.614
Who says this
has anything to do with Russo?

46:28.869 --> 46:31.163
Jeez.

46:32.664 --> 46:34.208
That's not a fun way to go.

46:37.669 --> 46:41.465
Look, Madani,
if I forgive you for shooting me,

46:41.548 --> 46:44.259
will you please tell me
what the hell is going on here?

46:48.889 --> 46:50.766
I'll have you up for obstruction!

46:57.648 --> 47:00.526
I'm the special agent in charge
for New York.

47:02.402 --> 47:06.406
And you, you're an NYPD dick
who can't catch his breath.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.283
So go ahead. Tell everyone I shot you.

47:08.367 --> 47:10.285
Bet the guys at the precinct
will love that.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.831
You know what, while you're at it,
try and ding me for obstruction.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.374
Let's see how far you get.

47:18.085 --> 47:21.672
Looks like you have a homicide
on your hands, Detective.

47:36.812 --> 47:37.813
It's me.

48:08.927 --> 48:11.221
They killed your whole family
right in front of you.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.934
Why... Why didn't you tell me that?

48:24.192 --> 48:25.903
And you killed them for it.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.241
Yeah.

48:32.534 --> 48:33.493
That's right.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.039
Did it make you feel better?

48:44.171 --> 48:45.380
Sometimes.

48:47.424 --> 48:48.967
Well, what does that mean?

48:56.099 --> 48:57.935
You came back. Hmm.

49:01.355 --> 49:02.356
I did.

49:09.363 --> 49:11.907
My name isn't Rachel, by the way.

49:13.617 --> 49:14.660
It's Amy.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.413
Figured you should probably know that.

49:21.750 --> 49:22.751
Okay.

49:25.253 --> 49:26.254
Okay.

49:29.591 --> 49:31.093
So, no more running?

49:38.350 --> 49:39.518
All right, then.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.088
Hello?

50:08.630 --> 50:11.425
It's me. It's Billy Russo.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.022
What...

50:27.858 --> 50:29.192
Are you hurt?

50:30.444 --> 50:31.445
Come in.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.412
I didn't know where else I could go.

50:40.495 --> 50:43.707
I didn't know
who else I could, um...

50:44.458 --> 50:46.168
How did you find my apartment?

50:47.044 --> 50:49.296
I, uh, I followed you home.

51:00.098 --> 51:01.850
Billy, whose blood is this?

51:11.234 --> 51:13.779
Please help me.

51:23.955 --> 51:24.915
Come on.

52:16.716 --> 52:18.135
It looks good.

52:22.514 --> 52:23.932
Feels the same.

52:26.393 --> 52:27.561
What about up here?

52:31.148 --> 52:32.274
I don't know.

52:34.734 --> 52:36.361
I did get to thinking about...

52:37.404 --> 52:40.949
about the people that I do know. Did know.

52:42.909 --> 52:44.286
My brothers out there...

52:46.538 --> 52:47.747
They were family.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.961
Never really had that before, you know?

52:55.380 --> 52:56.506
You miss them.

53:08.018 --> 53:14.024
I was... I was the best version of myself
out there in the service.

53:14.107 --> 53:15.817
Swift, silent, deadly.

53:15.901 --> 53:17.819
We all were all of those things.

53:17.903 --> 53:20.405
We were a family,
and we were fighting for something.

53:20.488 --> 53:22.073
We weren't afraid of shit.

53:22.782 --> 53:23.867
And now...

53:25.994 --> 53:27.913
Now, there's...

53:29.831 --> 53:31.791
something just, just...

53:31.875 --> 53:34.669
just on the... edges of my mind.

53:34.753 --> 53:40.800
It's like a dark... shadow
just waiting for me.

53:51.811 --> 53:53.230
The thing is, Doc...

53:55.398 --> 53:57.317
I deserve to feel the fear.

54:00.654 --> 54:04.407
I don't know why, but I know...

54:09.412 --> 54:10.747
I deserve this.

54:21.132 --> 54:22.217
What if...

54:24.886 --> 54:27.681
What if you opened your mind
to the idea of redemption?

54:29.182 --> 54:32.435
Every human being deserves that.
I promise you.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.315
I will help you get there.

54:43.697 --> 54:45.573
I wouldn't blame you.

54:48.034 --> 54:51.913
You asked me what face it is
I want the world to see.

54:54.040 --> 54:57.210
This face. This... This face...

54:58.336 --> 55:02.007
has everything that I ever did wrong
written all over it.

55:02.590 --> 55:05.927
And when I look in the mirror,
I want to see...

55:07.929 --> 55:11.182
I want to see
the best version of myself again.

55:16.688 --> 55:19.899
Do you think that that's possible?

55:22.777 --> 55:25.447
Do you think that that's possible
for someone like me?
