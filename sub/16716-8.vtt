WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:03.069
You had a one-night
stand with your husband?

00:03.094 --> 00:04.374
<i>Now he's gonna think we have a shot</i>

00:04.399 --> 00:05.842
<i>at getting back together.</i>

00:05.867 --> 00:07.589
- Have we met?
- Colin McNichol.

00:07.614 --> 00:09.848
I did a piece on
"The New Yorker"'s Page-Turner blog.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.244
- Hey, isn't that your boss?
- He's on a date.

00:12.269 --> 00:15.605
Radha, this is a colleague of mine,
Liza Miller.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.134
Tell me about yourself, Liza.

00:17.159 --> 00:18.812
<i>I would love to know
about the young woman</i>

00:18.837 --> 00:22.105
who spends so much time with the
man that I am just crazy about.

00:22.130 --> 00:24.306
You followed your heart,
and that's what's important.

00:24.331 --> 00:26.141
Well, sometimes I can be impulsive

00:26.166 --> 00:28.582
when I'm following my heart.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.736 --> 00:39.736
Oh, good morning.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.808
Uh, good morning.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.592
I noticed you getting in
your car at Lenox Hill.

00:45.957 --> 00:47.925
- Oh.
- I was never sure how biking

00:47.950 --> 00:49.395
compared to driving in the city,

00:49.420 --> 00:51.753
but, uh, I got here before you did.

00:52.390 --> 00:54.189
Well...

00:54.646 --> 00:56.003
You must be fast.

00:56.028 --> 00:57.551
Today I am.

01:01.525 --> 01:03.758
And then he says,

01:03.783 --> 01:05.586
"Today I am."

01:05.997 --> 01:08.138
I didn't have the heart to
tell him I stopped in the 60s

01:08.163 --> 01:09.426
to drop off dry cleaning.

01:09.451 --> 01:11.442
Men don't just talk
to women in the street

01:11.467 --> 01:13.032
like that unless they're interested.

01:13.057 --> 01:15.193
I bet he's had his eye
on you for a while.

01:15.217 --> 01:16.550
At least since 77th Street.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.939
Ah! This is exciting.

01:18.964 --> 01:20.215
Oh, by the way, um, I have

01:20.240 --> 01:21.965
out-of-the-office lunch plans today.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.923
Liza, never interrupt

01:23.948 --> 01:25.706
my moment with your plans.

01:25.731 --> 01:26.809
Yeah.

01:31.493 --> 01:34.579
So there are, uh,
very few assets to discuss here.

01:34.604 --> 01:36.729
Liza has taken on the car payment.

01:36.753 --> 01:40.093
The business is leveraged.
That's all yours, David.

01:40.118 --> 01:43.339
Now, I see there are quite a few
airline miles on the joint card.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.490
Is that something you'd like to discuss?

01:44.515 --> 01:46.755
- Uh, sure.
- Oh. Airline miles.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.687
No, I, uh... I gave those to a friend.

01:48.712 --> 01:49.867
So...

01:51.429 --> 01:53.599
Poker game. Mohegan Sun.

01:53.624 --> 01:55.049
Never mind.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.262
Well, then, I guess that covers it.

01:56.287 --> 01:57.792
No, actually... Actually, there are...

01:57.817 --> 01:59.889
There are some unresolved issues.

01:59.914 --> 02:00.810
No, there aren't.

02:00.835 --> 02:02.923
We slept together recently.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.782
- Uh, that isn't relevant.
- Well, I just...

02:04.807 --> 02:05.994
I think he should know all the facts.

02:06.019 --> 02:08.621
- I'm not a therapist.
- But just as a person.

02:08.645 --> 02:10.526
I mean, don't you think it's
kind of interesting that...

02:10.550 --> 02:12.441
In my experience, sex can be nothing,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.692
- and a kiss can mean a lot.
- Couldn't agree more.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.542
Well, there...
there were a lot of raw emotions.

02:16.567 --> 02:18.023
More wine than emotions.

02:18.048 --> 02:20.882
Okay, well, I can't
stop thinking about it.

02:21.336 --> 02:23.831
- Could you give us a minute?
- Please don't.

02:23.856 --> 02:26.932
I have to go to the bathroom anyway.

02:29.519 --> 02:31.243
Look, I've been trying to find

02:31.268 --> 02:32.914
the right time to tell you this,

02:32.939 --> 02:34.682
but, uh,

02:35.072 --> 02:37.281
I broke up with Debbie.

02:37.306 --> 02:39.293
Oh. I'm...

02:40.082 --> 02:41.380
sorry?

02:41.754 --> 02:43.220
So that means we're both single.

02:43.245 --> 02:45.128
If we're gonna give it another try,

02:45.153 --> 02:46.283
now is the time.

02:46.308 --> 02:48.992
I got back with my boyfriend.

02:50.991 --> 02:53.434
Liza.

02:53.459 --> 02:55.387
We were together for 22 years.

02:55.412 --> 02:57.301
- Almost 22 years.
- Who is this guy?

02:57.326 --> 03:00.225
It... what is he, paying
your bills or something?

03:01.049 --> 03:02.482
I....

03:02.507 --> 03:05.617
Look, at least tell me his name.

03:06.242 --> 03:08.039
Josh.

03:08.666 --> 03:12.004
Josh? Are you for real?

03:12.029 --> 03:14.150
As real as my signature
on these divorce papers.

03:14.175 --> 03:16.140
Your turn.

03:27.431 --> 03:28.496
Maggie!

03:28.521 --> 03:30.014
Coming!

03:32.853 --> 03:35.257
You're finally divorced, and now

03:35.282 --> 03:36.862
you want to cook and clean?

03:36.966 --> 03:38.065
Women.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.253
It's a special occasion.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.709
To your divorce.

03:42.734 --> 03:43.722
I would rather toast

03:43.747 --> 03:45.979
to what got me through the divorce.

03:46.004 --> 03:47.249
- Okay.
- You.

03:47.274 --> 03:49.446
- That's dumb. No.
- No, stop.

03:49.473 --> 03:50.387
Sit.

03:50.412 --> 03:52.440
Let me say this.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.020
Maggie... Liza.

03:57.045 --> 03:59.087
Without you, I would be living

03:59.112 --> 04:00.443
in Michelle's pool house

04:00.468 --> 04:02.487
and folding boxer briefs at Nordstrom.

04:02.512 --> 04:04.358
You've given me a home,

04:04.752 --> 04:07.586
and allowed me to make
a better life for myself

04:07.611 --> 04:08.990
than the one I had.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.813
I will never be able to pay you back.

04:10.838 --> 04:12.510
You don't have to. You're family.

04:12.535 --> 04:13.880
I know, but please,

04:13.905 --> 04:16.081
just let me say this.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.466
Thank you.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.425
You're welcome.

04:23.450 --> 04:24.908
Come here, you.

04:24.933 --> 04:27.309
Love you.

04:29.994 --> 04:32.649
I didn't think I'd cry
before I tasted the food.

04:32.674 --> 04:34.215
Oh, you... Stop it.

04:35.366 --> 04:37.212
I had no idea they had

04:37.236 --> 04:39.050
to-go alcohol in Brooklyn.

04:39.075 --> 04:40.659
There's also a cupcake delivery service

04:40.684 --> 04:41.752
that'll bring you weed.

04:41.776 --> 04:43.075
What?

04:43.267 --> 04:45.189
Do you think they
deliver on the sidewalk?

04:45.214 --> 04:47.311
Mm. I live right down the block.

04:47.336 --> 04:49.563
I'm sure we could get
it delivered there.

04:50.366 --> 04:53.348
Is this whole takeout Margarita,

04:53.373 --> 04:55.604
delivery cupcake talk
just a big ol' plan

04:55.629 --> 04:57.366
to get me back to your apartment?

04:57.903 --> 05:00.017
Yes. 100%.

05:01.396 --> 05:03.644
Well, I do like a planner.

05:03.669 --> 05:04.971
What else do you like?

05:04.995 --> 05:06.944
- Tell me everything.
- Everything?

05:06.969 --> 05:08.969
Did you always know you
wanted a career in publishing?

05:08.994 --> 05:11.625
No, but I always read a lot.

05:11.650 --> 05:13.429
Child care's expensive, so,

05:13.454 --> 05:15.212
my mom just got me a bunch of books

05:15.237 --> 05:16.779
and would take me everywhere with her.

05:16.804 --> 05:19.947
- And your dad?
- Just a mom.

05:19.972 --> 05:21.259
What about you?

05:21.283 --> 05:23.615
Did you always know you wanted to write?

05:23.640 --> 05:25.420
I did.

05:26.223 --> 05:27.828
Well, working for "The New Yorker"

05:27.853 --> 05:28.790
is a writer's dream job.

05:28.815 --> 05:30.276
Well, NewYorker.com.

05:30.301 --> 05:33.127
I'm not sure if you've heard,

05:33.152 --> 05:35.868
but the Internet is kind of
a promising area right now.

05:35.893 --> 05:37.928
It is, it is, but my dream job

05:37.953 --> 05:39.580
is to write fiction.

05:39.734 --> 05:41.044
Oh, really.

05:41.069 --> 05:43.203
I actually just finished my novel.

05:43.228 --> 05:45.710
Wow. Good for you.

05:45.735 --> 05:47.253
I don't know how good it is, but I, uh,

05:47.279 --> 05:50.035
I could use a professional opinion.

05:50.608 --> 05:52.690
- Mine?
- Well, yeah.

05:52.715 --> 05:54.882
You're like a star editor
at a great imprint.

05:54.907 --> 05:56.134
You know a good book when you see it.

05:56.159 --> 05:58.020
Oh, and... and a bad one, of course.

05:59.152 --> 06:02.510
Well, I'm... flattered.

06:02.536 --> 06:03.465
So...

06:03.789 --> 06:05.768
So, I'll read it.

06:05.793 --> 06:07.693
Great. Thank you.

06:07.955 --> 06:09.454
Oh, here. Here's my place.

06:09.479 --> 06:11.010
Come in. Print you out a copy.

06:11.035 --> 06:12.363
Actually, um,

06:12.388 --> 06:15.089
I have an early day tomorrow.

06:15.114 --> 06:16.740
Email it?

06:17.071 --> 06:19.603
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Cool.

06:20.212 --> 06:21.679
Good night.

06:24.597 --> 06:26.506
The papers are signed.

06:26.531 --> 06:28.776
Yes! You are all mine now.

06:28.801 --> 06:30.218
Oh.

06:30.842 --> 06:33.459
You know, when you think about it,

06:33.519 --> 06:36.423
this whole time,
we've been kind of committing adultery.

06:36.448 --> 06:38.045
I hope I still find you attractive

06:38.070 --> 06:39.288
now that you're not my...

06:39.564 --> 06:41.330
what's the male
equivalent to "Mistress"?

06:41.355 --> 06:43.354
Uh, how about "Side piece?"

06:43.379 --> 06:46.061
Oh, I like that.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.882
- Oh.
- No.

06:48.907 --> 06:50.231
- No, no, no. Stop!
- No. Sorry.

06:50.256 --> 06:52.122
It's the mediator. Hello?

06:52.147 --> 06:53.499
Hi, Liza. Sorry to bother you.

06:53.524 --> 06:54.890
Uh, it appears you put the wrong

06:54.915 --> 06:56.678
birth date on this paperwork.

06:56.703 --> 06:58.381
Apparently, you think you're 26.

07:00.335 --> 07:02.050
Oh, wow, that's weird.

07:02.075 --> 07:04.248
Um, do you need me to shoot you over

07:04.273 --> 07:05.644
an email with the correct birth date?

07:05.669 --> 07:07.618
Uh, unfortunately no.
I need both you and David

07:07.643 --> 07:09.364
to come in tomorrow
to sign an amendment.

07:09.389 --> 07:11.228
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

07:11.919 --> 07:14.578
Okay. All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.894
Looks like you're my side piece

07:19.919 --> 07:21.563
for a little while longer.

07:21.588 --> 07:23.592
Get over here.

07:34.014 --> 07:35.672
Drive faster.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.803
Looks like I beat you this time.

07:42.828 --> 07:44.989
Well, then,
we have to meet after work and race.

07:45.014 --> 07:46.827
Clay.

07:46.852 --> 07:48.098
Diana.

07:48.123 --> 07:49.984
Do you MetroBike, Diana?

07:50.009 --> 07:51.711
Of course.

07:51.736 --> 07:53.356
I'm also at the top of the torque board

07:53.381 --> 07:54.381
at Flywheel, so don't think

07:54.406 --> 07:55.343
about taking it easy.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.132
Then it's a date.

07:57.724 --> 07:59.532
I guess it is.

08:01.068 --> 08:03.901
And then he says, "It's a date."

08:03.926 --> 08:05.623
See? I knew he liked you.

08:05.648 --> 08:07.477
All right, now,
I need you to do a little research

08:07.502 --> 08:09.725
and show me how this
socialist bike system works.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.988
On it.

08:12.675 --> 08:15.558
Well, guess who has a
book he wants me to read?

08:15.583 --> 08:17.073
This would be a much easier question

08:17.098 --> 08:18.555
if we didn't work in publishing.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.010
- Colin.
- Oh, no.

08:20.035 --> 08:21.341
Oh, yes.

08:21.366 --> 08:23.833
First date,
and he asked me to read his novel.

08:23.858 --> 08:25.758
Like, are you even
interested in me at all,

08:25.783 --> 08:27.235
or are you just looking for an editor?

08:27.260 --> 08:28.693
Honestly, probably both.

08:28.718 --> 08:32.355
Well, that is a huge,
huge gamble on his part,

08:32.380 --> 08:35.058
because if it's not good, shop's closed.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.078
Shop does not open for a bad writer.

08:37.102 --> 08:38.812
Oh, and the best part.

08:38.837 --> 08:40.849
It's 900 pages.

08:40.874 --> 08:41.672
Ugh.

08:41.697 --> 08:43.417
Maybe it's the next "Infinite Jest."

08:43.442 --> 08:44.745
Oh, perfect.

08:44.770 --> 08:46.538
Then I can just pretend to have read it.

08:46.563 --> 08:47.628
You know what?

08:47.653 --> 08:48.542
You should just

08:48.567 --> 08:49.906
turn your phone off after work

08:49.931 --> 08:50.941
and take a stab at it.

08:50.967 --> 08:51.903
It's better to know now

08:51.928 --> 08:53.001
if it's not gonna work.

08:53.026 --> 08:55.735
I know, Liza. I know.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.067
Stab you.

08:57.091 --> 08:58.380
Ow.

09:03.545 --> 09:06.038
Does it look too brand-new?
Should I scuff it up a little?

09:06.063 --> 09:07.695
It looks like I'm an excellent rider,

09:07.720 --> 09:08.873
which, hopefully, I am.

09:08.898 --> 09:10.416
Now run me through the process again.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.251
Credit card in, pull the bike out.

09:12.276 --> 09:14.798
You have 30 minutes to ride
before you need to re-dock.

09:14.823 --> 09:16.873
- "Re-dock"?
- Oh, put the bike back.

09:16.898 --> 09:18.297
You can just put it in his dock.

09:18.322 --> 09:19.542
Oh, I think the whole point of this

09:19.567 --> 09:20.871
is that he puts it in mine.

09:20.896 --> 09:22.570
Oh, speak of the devil.

09:22.595 --> 09:23.581
How do I look?

09:23.606 --> 09:25.257
Too good to be on a rental bike.

09:25.283 --> 09:27.892
Perfect. Okay.

09:28.934 --> 09:31.262
- Hi, stranger.
- Hey. How are you?

09:31.287 --> 09:32.873
Good, good.

09:35.548 --> 09:38.021
So, you work at Empirical?

09:38.047 --> 09:39.742
Yes. Yes. And you?

09:39.767 --> 09:42.201
I work in advertising. Graphic design.

09:42.226 --> 09:44.214
Oh. An artist.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.740
I don't know about that, but

09:45.765 --> 09:48.078
I do appreciate beautiful things.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.893
You certainly caught my eye.

09:49.918 --> 09:52.176
- I just love your look.
- Thank you.

09:52.201 --> 09:53.579
- Huh?
- Thank you!

09:53.604 --> 09:55.079
Oh, you're welcome.

09:55.201 --> 09:57.639
I ride this way.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.881
- Oh.
- We should hang out sometime.

09:59.972 --> 10:02.117
- How about now?
- Well, I can't tonight.

10:02.142 --> 10:03.678
I'm meeting my husband for dinner.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.080
I should introduce you to him.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.069
He works in fashion.
You two would hit it off.

10:07.094 --> 10:09.436
Your... husband?

10:09.461 --> 10:10.262
Yeah.

10:10.287 --> 10:12.777
Uh, he lets you out without a ring.

10:12.802 --> 10:14.899
So... modern.

10:14.924 --> 10:16.938
Bye.

10:16.963 --> 10:18.485
Bye.

10:37.361 --> 10:38.870
Uh, hey, you gonna read it?

10:38.895 --> 10:41.552
Yep. Phone's off. Food's delivered.

10:41.577 --> 10:44.077
I had to buy extra storage on my Dropbox

10:44.102 --> 10:45.268
just to open the file.

10:45.293 --> 10:46.959
Hey, even if the book's terrible,

10:46.984 --> 10:48.427
he's still got those abs.

10:48.452 --> 10:50.940
Those are the abs of
a confident man, Liza.

10:50.965 --> 10:54.894
If you destroy a man's confidence,
the abs will follow.

10:54.919 --> 10:56.093
Oh.

10:58.951 --> 11:01.624
_

11:01.648 --> 11:04.151
_

11:04.176 --> 11:05.946
_

11:24.338 --> 11:26.750
I wish my face was that seat!

11:29.852 --> 11:31.156
Damn.

11:31.181 --> 11:32.446
Ah!

11:32.471 --> 11:33.594
Shit.

11:43.158 --> 11:44.808
_

11:44.833 --> 11:46.015
Shit.

11:51.855 --> 11:54.422
Ah, this whole thing's gonna
be expensive, isn't it?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.065
Well, work should take care of anything

11:56.090 --> 11:57.607
that your insurance doesn't cover.

11:57.632 --> 11:58.764
The last thing I want to do

11:58.789 --> 12:00.378
is draw attention to myself in HR.

12:00.403 --> 12:03.218
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

12:03.243 --> 12:04.152
I'm okay.

12:04.178 --> 12:05.044
Wait, careful.

12:05.069 --> 12:06.653
Her collarbone might be broken.

12:06.678 --> 12:08.730
Hey, Liza. I'm Barb.

12:08.755 --> 12:10.198
I'll be taking care of you.

12:10.223 --> 12:12.073
There are no rules about visiting hours.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.442
All we ask is that you let Liza rest.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.342
That's the best thing for her right now.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.274
You know what might help? Pain meds.

12:18.299 --> 12:20.048
Yeah, whatever they
gave me is wearing off.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.873
I think they didn't
account for my height.

12:21.898 --> 12:24.752
Yeah, it's not height that
makes a difference, it's weight.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.688
Well, her pain's at
about a Chris Christie,

12:26.713 --> 12:28.378
so anything strong might be helpful.

12:28.403 --> 12:30.665
The radiologist has been paged.

12:30.690 --> 12:32.390
As soon as he reads the X-rays,

12:32.415 --> 12:34.901
we'll know how to proceed
with the pain management.

12:34.926 --> 12:37.221
I think that this will do for now.

12:37.246 --> 12:39.615
That's an aspirin.

12:48.481 --> 12:51.310
They're all academics,
so just kick me under the table

12:51.335 --> 12:52.766
if the conversation gets too boring

12:52.792 --> 12:54.717
or someone uses the word "Tenure."

12:54.741 --> 12:56.139
Will do.

12:56.165 --> 12:57.958
Hey.

12:58.347 --> 13:00.262
Thank you for coming.

13:00.287 --> 13:02.796
Of course.

13:05.258 --> 13:06.258
Ah.

13:07.771 --> 13:09.893
One second. It's work.

13:09.918 --> 13:11.923
Hello?

13:13.355 --> 13:15.189
Yeah.

13:15.718 --> 13:18.182
Okay, thank you for letting me know.

13:18.207 --> 13:19.612
What is it?

13:19.637 --> 13:21.503
Uh, Liza was in an accident.

13:21.528 --> 13:22.776
She's in the hospital.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.016
Is she all right?

13:24.041 --> 13:25.569
Uh, I... I don't know.

13:25.594 --> 13:28.383
Well, I'm sure she has
people to look after her.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.684
I... yeah, I'm sure she does too.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.503
I feel like I should go check on her.

13:32.528 --> 13:33.640
Why?

13:33.666 --> 13:35.363
It... it was work-related.

13:35.387 --> 13:37.045
She was running an errand for her boss.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.903
But we're having dinner with my friends,

13:38.928 --> 13:40.568
and I... I haven't seen you all week.

13:40.818 --> 13:43.038
It won't take long.

13:43.409 --> 13:45.021
You can't be serious.

13:45.046 --> 13:48.282
She is an employee
that I... I care about.

13:48.307 --> 13:49.764
Oh, I've noticed.

13:49.790 --> 13:52.637
Radha, I'll make this as quick as I can.

13:53.263 --> 13:56.143
Charles,
if you leave to go and see that girl,

13:56.171 --> 13:57.997
we're over.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.356
I hope you don't mean that.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.254
Liza Ann Miller.

14:10.295 --> 14:13.753
Wow... babe, you're almost 41.

14:14.149 --> 14:15.833
Stop.

14:16.609 --> 14:19.890
Oh, thank God you're okay.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.484
The bike is not, FYI.

14:22.509 --> 14:26.131
Hey, uh, do you want to sit down?

14:26.156 --> 14:29.720
Oh, I'll... hover. It's fine.

14:30.072 --> 14:31.618
Is it her head?

14:31.643 --> 14:32.876
Does she recognize me?

14:32.901 --> 14:34.405
Of course I recognize you.

14:34.430 --> 14:35.514
Oh, well you hadn't said anything,

14:35.539 --> 14:36.437
so I wasn't sure.

14:36.461 --> 14:37.178
Sorry.

14:37.203 --> 14:39.261
She had a pretty bad accident.

14:39.287 --> 14:41.140
Her collarbone might be broken.

14:41.165 --> 14:43.672
- Mm.
- So, I mean, how did it happen?

14:43.697 --> 14:45.634
A car stopped short, I hit it,

14:45.659 --> 14:47.694
and Supermanned over the handlebars.

14:47.718 --> 14:49.067
It should have been Becky.

14:49.092 --> 14:51.659
From now on, all menial tasks go to her.

14:51.684 --> 14:53.001
And that is a promise.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.807
And...

14:57.573 --> 14:59.505
I'm sorry.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.088
Thanks.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.956
Hmm.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.244
Sorry, she's, uh,
she's usually super punctual.

15:10.550 --> 15:12.420
She was always hustling me out the door.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.144
I used to say, "Babe",

15:14.169 --> 15:15.792
"the world is gonna keep turning

15:15.818 --> 15:17.249
"whether we're five minutes late

15:17.274 --> 15:18.410
or five minutes early."

15:18.435 --> 15:20.460
Oh. Bet she loved that.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.971
Yeah, we... We used to joke a lot.

15:24.393 --> 15:26.359
Maybe she's having second thoughts.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.165
Why don't you give her a call?

15:35.629 --> 15:38.081
- David.
<i>- Hey, uh, where are you?</i>

15:38.117 --> 15:40.651
It's Maggie. Liza's in the hospital.

15:40.676 --> 15:41.983
Oh, my God.

15:52.490 --> 15:53.843
Hey.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.483
I read your book.

15:55.507 --> 15:57.094
And?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.816
It's good.

15:59.841 --> 16:01.661
It's really good.

16:01.685 --> 16:03.632
I'm so happy you like it.

16:03.657 --> 16:06.328
Trust me, I'm happier.

16:10.152 --> 16:12.319
Hey. Careful, careful, careful.

16:12.344 --> 16:13.377
We come bearing gifts.

16:13.402 --> 16:16.048
Oh, shoot. I didn't bring you any.

16:16.073 --> 16:18.521
So, the good news is you
don't have to have surgery.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.173
But your clavicle is fractured.

16:20.198 --> 16:22.301
How long's recovery?

16:22.326 --> 16:23.851
Well, if she's good about
wearing the immobilizer,

16:23.876 --> 16:25.018
it should heal quickly.

16:25.043 --> 16:26.483
And because it's not your dominant side,

16:26.508 --> 16:27.665
you could return to work immediately.

16:27.690 --> 16:29.673
Oh, it's my lucky day.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.255
Any other questions?

16:31.280 --> 16:33.902
I'm in a lot of pain, doctor.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.460
Ah, we're gonna get you a morphine drip

16:35.485 --> 16:36.851
with a button to self-administer.

16:36.876 --> 16:38.160
Gonna feel better in no time.

16:38.185 --> 16:39.667
Thank you.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.772
Mama Mia.

16:41.797 --> 16:44.190
She's gonna need us.

16:44.898 --> 16:48.163
You know I'm down to help with anything,
right?

16:48.188 --> 16:50.233
Well, cooking, cleaning,
getting her dressed...

16:50.259 --> 16:51.468
I can cover those things.

16:51.493 --> 16:53.247
Okay, getting undressed, baths?

16:53.272 --> 16:54.546
I got it covered.

16:54.571 --> 16:56.730
I figured you could handle those jobs.

16:56.897 --> 16:58.851
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Okay.

16:58.876 --> 17:00.288
You can take off.

17:00.313 --> 17:02.838
I'm gonna go find some
blankets for the sleepover.

17:02.862 --> 17:04.680
You're a good guy.

17:12.941 --> 17:14.941
Hey!

17:14.965 --> 17:16.674
Hi.

17:17.580 --> 17:19.766
You okay? Is it your arm?

17:19.790 --> 17:22.015
Clavicle. It's broken.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.800
I may never shrug again.

17:23.826 --> 17:25.907
Ah, what are you doing here?

17:25.932 --> 17:28.560
Uh, Diana alerted the, uh,

17:28.863 --> 17:31.901
Empirical legal team,
and they alerted me.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.484
Oh. Don't worry.

17:33.509 --> 17:35.511
I'm not feeling up to a lawsuit.

17:37.305 --> 17:38.947
Are you in pain?

17:40.444 --> 17:43.304
I'm feeling much better now.

17:43.864 --> 17:45.744
Is there, uh...

17:46.563 --> 17:48.316
anything I can do?

17:48.341 --> 17:49.934
There is one thing.

17:49.959 --> 17:51.530
Yeah, yeah. What is it?

17:51.555 --> 17:53.369
My piggies are out.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.291
This little piggy broke her collarbone.

18:07.463 --> 18:09.365
Mm...

18:09.390 --> 18:10.389
Is that better?

18:10.414 --> 18:13.033
You are so, so...

18:13.922 --> 18:15.620
nice...

18:15.645 --> 18:16.911
I should let you rest.

18:16.936 --> 18:18.225
No, wait. Wait.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.765
I want to tell you something.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.383
Yeah?

18:35.158 --> 18:37.125
Goodnight, piggies.

18:54.606 --> 18:56.391
Hey.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.285
Hey, I...

18:58.767 --> 19:01.167
I just wanted to say...

19:01.192 --> 19:03.860
That thing that happened between us

19:03.885 --> 19:06.069
meant something to me.

19:06.094 --> 19:09.768
Maybe if we were different people,

19:09.793 --> 19:11.355
or in a different place,

19:11.380 --> 19:14.679
and, like, a different time...

19:14.816 --> 19:18.077
things would be different.

19:21.965 --> 19:24.329
I knew it.

19:26.637 --> 19:28.236
David?

19:28.261 --> 19:30.002
Hey, bud.

19:30.027 --> 19:31.343
Who are you?

19:31.554 --> 19:34.440
Uh, I don't know. Who are you?

19:34.465 --> 19:36.738
I'm Josh. Liza's boyfriend.

19:37.616 --> 19:39.525
You're Josh, huh?

19:39.550 --> 19:40.535
Yeah.

19:41.796 --> 19:44.012
Well, uh, I'm Liza's husband.

19:44.037 --> 19:45.331
David.

19:45.356 --> 19:48.198
Oh, you... you mean
ex-husband, though, right?

19:48.223 --> 19:50.570
Mm, not quite.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.485
Bud.

20:39.185 --> 20:40.718
Ah! Jesus!

20:43.714 --> 20:44.846
Wha...

20:44.871 --> 20:46.834
Looks like you beat me.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.934
Oh, my God. I just heard.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.259
I feel so bad I wasn't there.

20:59.284 --> 21:01.032
I... I had my phone turned off.

21:01.057 --> 21:02.580
I was plenty taken care of.

21:02.605 --> 21:04.725
And I don't really even
remember most of it.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.167
How was the manuscript?

21:06.192 --> 21:08.258
Oh, it was so good.

21:08.283 --> 21:09.551
Did you read the whole thing?

21:09.576 --> 21:10.776
I read enough to know

21:10.801 --> 21:12.143
that we have to publish it.

21:12.168 --> 21:13.534
And how was the sex?

21:13.559 --> 21:15.725
- Liza!
- What?

21:15.796 --> 21:18.153
It was similar to the book.

21:18.178 --> 21:19.329
What, didn't finish?

21:19.354 --> 21:21.937
Good. It was really good.

21:21.962 --> 21:23.462
Send me Colin's manuscript.

21:23.487 --> 21:25.706
I already did.

21:25.731 --> 21:28.334
Becky's coffee is undrinkable.

21:29.073 --> 21:30.615
I am so sorry.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.284
I really wanted this for you.

21:32.309 --> 21:33.704
But you do the coffee,

21:33.729 --> 21:35.710
Becky does everything else.

21:36.892 --> 21:38.571
And, um...

21:38.596 --> 21:40.662
while you were incapacitated,

21:40.687 --> 21:42.549
Charles and Radha broke up.

21:42.755 --> 21:44.716
Sad face.

21:52.035 --> 21:54.137
_

21:54.322 --> 21:55.694
Hey.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.374
Those piggies get some good rest?

21:59.399 --> 22:01.765
What... Excuse me?

22:01.997 --> 22:04.041
Uh, nothing.

22:04.066 --> 22:05.255
I'm...

22:05.860 --> 22:08.492
glad to have you back, that's all.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.843
I'm glad to be back.
