supposed to deal with auditors

see over the end of the desk?

you don't mind me saying, Alfie,

stitched me up a little bit on that.

(CALLS OUT) Hello?

09:51.150 --> 09:52.750
Is there anybody there?

09:53.550 --> 09:55.470
I've just come to exchange the bags,

09:55.510 --> 09:57.670
if there is anybody there.

10:00.670 --> 10:03.230
Erm, y-you probably
don't want me to see your face,

10:03.270 --> 10:05.310
so I-I'm just gonna swap the bags.

10:05.350 --> 10:07.550
But I've just got to get
my packed lunch from this bag

10:07.590 --> 10:09.430
a- and move it to the other one.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.750
Just so there are
no misunderstandings.

10:14.830 --> 10:17.230
OK, y-you can have the packed lunch.

10:20.170 --> 10:22.010
Wait!
GIRL: Don't turn around.

10:22.050 --> 10:23.170
I- I won't.

10:24.370 --> 10:25.930
How old are you?

10:25.970 --> 10:27.730
That's a really creepy question.

10:27.770 --> 10:30.450
Are you a paedo?
What?! No, I'm not a paedo.

10:30.490 --> 10:32.490
Why are you so obsessed
with my age then?

10:32.530 --> 10:34.410
I know your sort.
Wha-? I'm not any "sort".

10:34.450 --> 10:36.090
Can't you ask a kid their age
anymore?

10:36.130 --> 10:37.370
I better get Uncle Dave.

10:37.410 --> 10:39.850
If it's one thing Dave hates,
it's a nonce.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.690
What? I am NOT a nonce. OK?

10:41.730 --> 10:44.010
If anything, a nonce
wouldn't be interested in your age.

10:44.050 --> 10:45.210
I'm the opposite of a nonce.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.810
You know a lot about nonces,
don't you?

10:46.850 --> 10:48.370
You know what? I'm gonna stop talking

10:48.410 --> 10:51.410
because you're twisting
everything I say. Please just listen.

Oh, thank God.

11:06.730 --> 11:09.330

Don't you turn around.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.050
So check it out boss, baby...

11:11.090 --> 11:13.410
We're gonna have a nice calm chat
for a second.

11:13.450 --> 11:16.090
Allison, you need to be very,
very careful, OK?

11:16.130 --> 11:18.890
She has got a gun.
No, the toddler has a nail gun.

11:18.930 --> 11:21.370
But I have an ACTUAL gun, so look...

11:21.410 --> 11:24.370
My husband here-Are you
telling me you married this perv?

11:24.410 --> 11:26.050
Yes. I married this perv.

11:26.090 --> 11:28.290
Well, perv is actually
better than nonce, so thank you.

11:28.330 --> 11:31.650
My husband
is doing a simple bag exchange.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.130
We were sent by Kethan.

11:33.970 --> 11:36.850
Oh. Why didn't you say so?

11:36.890 --> 11:39.850
Did you not hear me shouting?
You didn't say where you were from.

11:39.890 --> 11:41.690
(SIGHS) Jesus, Deacon!
Didn't I?

11:41.730 --> 11:43.450
That's like
bag drop rule number one.

11:43.490 --> 11:44.730
OK, you guys can go.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.410
Well,
I've turned up with a bag identical

11:46.450 --> 11:47.850
to the one you're waiting to swap.

11:47.890 --> 11:50.940
How likely is that to be a
coincidence, you little psychopath?

11:51.410 --> 11:52.890
What's your name?

11:52.930 --> 11:54.930
I think we're past intros, Allison.
Let's just go.

11:54.970 --> 11:56.450
Casey. Why?

11:56.490 --> 11:57.690
Yes, why?

11:57.730 --> 11:59.490
Casey, what are you doing here?

11:59.530 --> 12:01.610
My Uncle Dave is in the business.

12:01.650 --> 12:04.170
Now and again he gives me pocket
money to look after the place.

12:04.210 --> 12:06.370
It's no biggy.
Well, how old are you?

12:06.410 --> 12:08.090
Don't ask her that,
it's a trigger for her.

12:08.130 --> 12:09.930
13.

12:09.970 --> 12:12.290
Casey,
I know I don't know you very well,

12:12.330 --> 12:14.250
but you remind me
of my little sister,

12:14.290 --> 12:16.170
and...
you need to look after yourself.

12:16.210 --> 12:18.330
This is no place for a kid your age.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.530
Yeah. You're right.

12:22.690 --> 12:24.290
Thanks.

12:24.330 --> 12:25.930
That's OK.

12:26.770 --> 12:28.010
Uncle Dave?

12:28.050 --> 12:30.210
Some pervs
are trying to steal your bag! What?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.130
I knew it.
She hates it when you ask her age.

12:32.170 --> 12:34.610
Fuck's wrong with you, little bitch?
Allison, get the gun.

12:34.650 --> 12:36.850
Where the fuck would I get a gun?
It's a stick, Deacon.

19:27.130 --> 19:30.170
(SHOUTS) I cannot believe
you did the fucking eye!

19:30.210 --> 19:33.210
Fuck you!
Oh, fuck you twice.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.970
Can you guys
just take your stuff and go?

19:35.010 --> 19:37.010
Fuck you. Such an asshole.
Fuck you. Fuck you!

19:37.050 --> 19:38.810
Get out of here.
Oh, this is a great trip.

19:38.850 --> 19:41.690
Fuck you!
Passport.Yep.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.210
(LAUGHS)

19:43.250 --> 19:44.730
That was incredible.

19:44.770 --> 19:46.650
You were incredible.
You too, we nailed it.

19:46.690 --> 19:48.650
Yes! Yes.
BOTH: Boom!

19:48.690 --> 19:52.530
Erm... All that, erm... stuff
you were saying in the argument,

19:52.570 --> 19:55.090
that was just to get us through,
right? That's just for the bit?

19:55.130 --> 19:58.050
Yeah. Yeah.
And you didn't mean it either?

19:58.090 --> 20:00.850
No, course not. I didn't mean
any of that. Yeah. Yeah, no.

20:00.890 --> 20:03.570
(TYRES SCREECH)

20:07.690 --> 20:10.010
We have the bag.
Oh yeah.

20:10.050 --> 20:12.650
And if you wouldn't mind
passing on one of the biggest

20:12.690 --> 20:15.250
"Fuck you" s to your boss, Kethan,
I'd be extremely grateful.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.810
She's joking.
I'm not.

20:16.850 --> 20:18.130
She's joking.
No.

20:18.170 --> 20:20.650
Kethan says
he wants your mother's number.

20:20.690 --> 20:22.050
(SIGHS)

20:22.090 --> 20:23.210
(PHONE CHIMES)

20:23.250 --> 20:25.530
(TYRES SCREECH) Tell Kethan
I want HIS mother's number.

20:25.570 --> 20:27.130
Ooh! Voicemail from the clinic.

20:27.170 --> 20:29.290
Christ,
I hope this has all been worth it.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.050
Go on?

20:31.890 --> 20:34.490
Oh my God, Deacon,
they've fertilised five eggs.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.410
Five!

20:36.450 --> 20:38.410
Holy shit! That is amazing.

20:38.450 --> 20:39.690
It's incredible.
(SIGHS)

20:39.730 --> 20:42.890
We've got five... baby... egg things.
(PHONE CHIMES)

20:42.930 --> 20:46.810
Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna
get our hopes up, but maybe...

20:46.850 --> 20:48.930
Oh, if that is Kethan, you tell him

20:48.970 --> 20:51.270
to take that bag when he gets it,
lube it up...

20:54.650 --> 20:56.930
