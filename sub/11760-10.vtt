Galen. Galen!

01:09.824 --> 01:11.112
Are you all right? Galen.

01:11.816 --> 01:12.864
Mrs LaPier?

01:13.744 --> 01:15.144
It's... It's Jesper.

Oh, my...

01:21.980 --> 01:23.576
Ah... Help!

01:24.584 --> 01:26.664
Help! Help!

01:27.020 --> 01:28.500
Someone help!

02:37.496 --> 02:38.616
Welcome back.

02:39.408 --> 02:40.352
Oh...

02:41.300 --> 02:43.176
Very stylish.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.504
HOUDINI: Ah, the latest
in Canadian fashion.

02:45.648 --> 02:48.536
- Someone stole my suitcase.
- Your mysterious woman?

02:48.640 --> 02:49.592
Probably.

02:51.224 --> 02:53.940
- How was New York?
- Terrific. I slept like a baby.

02:53.968 --> 02:56.456
- How's the writing?
- Wonderful. I ran out of paper.

02:57.864 --> 02:59.472
HOUDINI: I looked up a doctor for you.

03:00.464 --> 03:02.728
Best respiratory specialist
in the world.

03:02.860 --> 03:05.696
- He agreed to review your wife's case.
- You had no right to do that.

03:05.736 --> 03:06.528
You're welcome.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.980
(DOOR OPENS)
Ahh...

03:09.000 --> 03:09.968
HOUDINI: Hey.

03:10.270 --> 03:13.160
- Always late but worth the wait!
- Welcome back.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.584
I've decided to stay here for a while.

03:15.664 --> 03:16.640
Oh, you met a guy?

03:17.728 --> 03:20.100
I arranged a meeting
with Mr Walbridge.

03:20.704 --> 03:22.832
- DOYLE: For when?
- Two days ago.

03:23.408 --> 03:25.128
- You went alone?
- STRATTON: I had to.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.216
You have no idea who this man is
or what he's capable of.

03:28.248 --> 03:29.120
He never showed up.

03:41.136 --> 03:42.040
Benjamin.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.680
Yes, my love. It's me.

03:45.980 --> 03:47.096
You're alive.

03:49.816 --> 03:51.936
It was all a lie. The funeral.

03:52.272 --> 03:54.288
The mourning. Tears.

03:54.640 --> 03:58.112
- You were an undercover agent?
- Until they found me out.

03:58.544 --> 04:00.472
But you have to stop pursuing this.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.140
They killed Nigel Pennington

04:02.280 --> 04:04.260
and they won't hesitate
to kill you, too.

04:12.832 --> 04:14.576
- Wow.
- DOYLE: Indeed.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.007
Wonderful news.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.160
You've been under a lot of stress.

04:22.376 --> 04:25.340
He's been on your mind. You sure
this wasn't some kind of... you know.

04:25.376 --> 04:28.180
Hysterical vision
to which females are prone?

04:28.640 --> 04:31.248
Females? No... everyone sees things.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.216
An Austrian doctor posited
we can have vivid dreams,

04:34.272 --> 04:36.008
indistinguishable from reality.

04:36.392 --> 04:37.208
Oh, yeah?

04:38.664 --> 04:41.184
- See?
- This wasn't a vision or a dream.

04:41.224 --> 04:43.394
HOUDINI: Which means
your husband was a secret

04:43.440 --> 04:45.577
terrorist fighter
who faked his own death.

04:45.645 --> 04:49.108
Yes. And that's why I'm not going
with you. I have to find him.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.274
But... (LAUGHS)

04:50.788 --> 04:52.822
He asked you to trust him,
leave him alone.

04:52.850 --> 04:55.108
I trust him. Which is why...

04:55.234 --> 04:57.897
I can't leave him alone,
knowing he's in danger.

04:57.954 --> 04:59.725
DOYLE: Which is exactly why
you can't pursue this.

04:59.771 --> 05:02.422
- I'm prepared to accept the risks.
- Well, we aren't.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.822
DOYLE: I've been in touch with
the authorities at LaPier, Ontario,

05:04.860 --> 05:06.141
there's a case they need our help with.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.475
There's always going
to be another case.

05:07.510 --> 05:09.653
There's always going to be something
that seems more important.

05:09.688 --> 05:11.080
47 dead.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.431
DOYLE: Whatever killed these people
may kill again.

05:14.968 --> 05:15.991
They need you.

05:25.217 --> 05:26.675
Whoa. Whoa.

05:30.620 --> 05:31.991
Corporal Bazay?

05:32.231 --> 05:34.426
Constable Stratton, I presume.

05:34.613 --> 05:37.048
Indeed. What's the latest
on the investigation?

05:37.066 --> 05:38.071
We're still waiting.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.644
BAZAY: The feds
are sending specialists.

05:41.991 --> 05:44.008
DOYLE: What if whatever it is
is spreading?

05:44.293 --> 05:47.084
BAZAY: This could have been anything.
The plague, an act of God.

05:47.137 --> 05:49.066
I'm not about to risk my men's lives.

05:49.111 --> 05:51.351
So you're gonna risk
other people's lives?

05:51.617 --> 05:52.960
STRATTON: There was a survivor?

05:53.084 --> 05:55.080
One. Reverend Farley.

05:55.511 --> 05:57.911
He went back in, won't come out.

05:58.062 --> 05:59.626
DOYLE: What do you think caused this?

06:00.897 --> 06:03.022
I think it was a sneak attack
by the Indians.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.906
I understood there was
no sign of violence.

06:06.980 --> 06:09.253
- They have their ways.
- Ah, so you're a bigot.

06:09.420 --> 06:11.780
HOUDINI: Is there anyone credible
we can talk to?

06:13.777 --> 06:16.808
BAZAY: If you want to risk
your lives... be my guest.

06:19.848 --> 06:20.951
Right this way.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.524
Am I the only one
who doesn't like Canadians?

06:26.684 --> 06:28.213
In case there's something contagious.

06:28.773 --> 06:30.248
I feel so much safer now.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.484
(SIGHS)

07:09.493 --> 07:11.030
Absolutely no sign of trauma.

07:11.626 --> 07:13.057
Some of them died
over their breakfast.

07:13.555 --> 07:15.368
No indication they tried to run.

07:15.751 --> 07:18.337
What's just as important
as why these people died...

07:19.466 --> 07:21.422
is why the Reverend survived.

07:26.231 --> 07:27.582
Reverend Farley?

07:33.066 --> 07:34.133
HOUDINI: Hey.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.893
<i>Whoa. Whoa.</i>

07:38.471 --> 07:39.680
It's all right.

07:46.062 --> 07:47.057
Why me?

07:49.386 --> 07:50.693
You're a man of God.

07:50.835 --> 07:53.306
He entrusted me with their lives.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.160
Why would he take them all away?

07:56.702 --> 07:59.422
They say the Lord moves
in mysterious ways, but this, I...

08:00.515 --> 08:02.293
Can you tell us anything about it?

08:03.288 --> 08:05.022
What you saw or heard?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.506
I fell asleep, working on the bell.

08:09.075 --> 08:12.488
The last sign of life that I saw, was
Galen LaPier coming home around one.

08:13.342 --> 08:14.666
When I woke up, it was seven.

08:14.835 --> 08:16.364
DOYLE: That's a window of six hours.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.760
Was anyone sick?

08:19.253 --> 08:21.368
We'd all feared influenza.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.542
I'd taken precautions,
drinking nothing but boiled coffee.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.253
It may be best for you to leave here.

08:27.831 --> 08:30.355
I... I... I can't abandon them.

08:31.351 --> 08:32.231
Not now.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.373
HOUDINI: Maybe it's the flu.

08:39.030 --> 08:41.972
The Russian influenza killed
a million people in the last ten years.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.937
My friend William Mycroft
succumbed to it,

08:43.982 --> 08:45.600
but the flu doesn't strike
that quickly.

08:45.777 --> 08:47.182
HOUDINI: Well, no flu you've seen.

08:47.635 --> 08:50.622
Maybe the Lord mysteriously moved in
with a whole new strain.

08:50.684 --> 08:53.546
God said unto Noah,
"The end of all flesh is before me,

08:53.591 --> 08:55.804
and behold, I shall destroy them
with the earth."

08:56.150 --> 08:58.053
If you're thinking
this is biblical, one,

08:58.364 --> 09:00.170
God promised never to do it again.

09:00.300 --> 09:03.440
Sealed the deal with a rainbow.
Two, that's just dumb.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.128
Then maybe this is
the work of the devil.

09:05.164 --> 09:06.270
HOUDINI: Come on.

09:06.675 --> 09:08.320
We all know you're not that gullible.

09:10.791 --> 09:12.613
You don't trust your husband, do you?

09:13.742 --> 09:16.560
That's why you want to find him and learn
the truth. Not because he's in danger.

09:17.768 --> 09:19.004
DOYLE: This wasn't the flu.

09:26.462 --> 09:28.586
This killed both men and mice alike.

09:29.226 --> 09:30.595
Maybe Adelaide is right.

09:30.631 --> 09:33.528
I saw a doctor's office.
Let's see what his records has to say.

09:33.662 --> 09:36.133
You know, before we completely
abandon reason.

09:58.151 --> 10:00.551
HOUDINI: I'm guessing the doctor
was alive at five to seven.

10:00.604 --> 10:03.004
This thing hit, he fell
and smashed his watch.

10:03.048 --> 10:05.608
STRATTON: According to the Reverend,
everyone was dead by seven.

10:05.644 --> 10:07.484
DOYLE: Inhumanly fast and fatal.

10:31.413 --> 10:32.657
I thought I saw someone.

10:32.853 --> 10:34.524
(OFF SCREEN)
An Indian man, by the trees.

10:35.057 --> 10:38.008
He's gone now.
No, it wasn't a vision.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.675
In the last four days,
the doctor had only one patient,

10:40.684 --> 10:41.768
a 12-year-old girl,

10:41.866 --> 10:44.524
complaining of weakness,
nausea and moderate hair loss.

10:44.568 --> 10:46.168
Subsisting on nothing but broth.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.168
Checked in three days ago.

10:48.382 --> 10:51.600
No indication she checked... out.

11:05.697 --> 11:06.773
Libby Cotter.

11:07.031 --> 11:08.890
Tomorrow would
have been her 13th birthday.

11:13.448 --> 11:14.337
(SHE GASPS)

11:18.204 --> 11:20.480
LIBBY: <i>I remember
being sick to my stomach.</i>

11:20.740 --> 11:23.128
My parents were scared I had the flu.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.120
They brought me to Dr Millet.

11:25.653 --> 11:27.066
This was Monday?

11:27.831 --> 11:29.040
I think so.

11:29.460 --> 11:30.817
Today's Thursday.

11:32.986 --> 11:34.880
Do you remember anything
about the last three days?

11:36.666 --> 11:37.680
No.

11:40.302 --> 11:42.808
Something happened here, in LaPier.

11:43.955 --> 11:46.382
We're not exactly sure what.

11:48.420 --> 11:49.900
Where's Dr Millet?

11:52.060 --> 11:54.450
- I'm sorry, dear.
- LIBBY: What do you mean?

11:54.817 --> 11:57.031
- Where are my parents?
- Libby, I'm...

11:57.860 --> 11:59.084
I'm sorry, Libby.

11:59.831 --> 12:03.022
<i>I'm sorry. I am... so sorry.</i>

12:03.600 --> 12:04.844
My parents.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.300
(LIBBY SOBS)

12:19.020 --> 12:20.800
STRATTON:
Corporal Bazay is with Libby.

12:20.871 --> 12:23.217
He's arranging for a nurse
and tracking down her relatives.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.296
I've been thinking about her symptoms.
I think she may have

12:25.304 --> 12:27.488
Addison's Disease, a kidney ailment.

12:27.928 --> 12:30.336
If Farley has the same thing,
could that be what kept them alive?

12:30.360 --> 12:33.448
That was my hope. But Farley's records
suggest nothing of the sort.

12:33.456 --> 12:34.040
(SIGHS)

12:34.060 --> 12:35.784
I don't have a medical explanation.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.376
So what else do the survivors
have in common?

12:39.112 --> 12:41.352
Farley's been drinking
nothing but boiled coffee

12:41.384 --> 12:44.184
and Libby's been out for three days,
so she hasn't had anything.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.928
And before that, nothing but broth,

12:45.992 --> 12:47.920
probably made with boiled water.

12:48.312 --> 12:50.504
HOUDINI: If the survivors
didn't have any fresh water,

12:51.160 --> 12:53.336
maybe the victims were
poisoned by the water supply.

12:54.008 --> 12:55.360
Let's find that water source.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.736
Another Indian?

13:32.120 --> 13:33.040
(SNIFFS)

13:33.104 --> 13:35.170
Highly acidic.
Quite possibly toxic.

13:35.262 --> 13:38.284
And pouring out of every tap
and water bucket in LaPier.

13:38.340 --> 13:40.770
But why would everyone die
at exactly the same time,

13:40.791 --> 13:43.330
given the differences in age,
weights, tolerances?

13:43.475 --> 13:45.890
Maybe the toxins were building
to a critical point?

13:45.900 --> 13:48.010
(OFF SCREEN) Maybe there was
an increase in the sluice?

13:48.062 --> 13:50.328
Whatever it was,
I bet this is our answer.

13:50.515 --> 13:52.222
Don't pack your bags quite yet.

13:52.613 --> 13:54.260
What about everyone downriver?

14:15.450 --> 14:16.826
BAZAY: Wake up, Walt!

14:17.155 --> 14:18.408
You've got visitors.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.622
(CHATTER)

14:30.471 --> 14:31.804
That's him.

14:41.557 --> 14:42.711
I am Wattabakinai.

14:45.466 --> 14:47.048
And that is why I answer to "Walt".

14:48.168 --> 14:49.342
Constable Stratton.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.008
Harry Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.066
You break out of white man's jails.

14:55.226 --> 14:56.346
All the time.

14:56.755 --> 14:57.955
HOUDINI: Everyone here okay?

14:59.220 --> 15:00.320
Everyone is good.

15:00.540 --> 15:03.857
We think whatever killed the people
in LaPier was in their water supply.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.466
We need you to stop drinking it.

15:07.220 --> 15:10.515
- Now you take our water?
- It may be poisoned by the mine.

15:10.613 --> 15:12.782
Why would the Corporal start
telling us the truth now?

15:15.324 --> 15:18.515
- Perhaps we should stay.
- Here? With them?

15:19.102 --> 15:22.017
- BAZAY: I don't think that's wise.
- We'll stay if they'll have us.

15:23.617 --> 15:25.902
- You're welcome.
- And do what?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.160
HOUDINI: Convince them
not to drink the water.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.690
Failing that, treat them.

15:29.777 --> 15:31.884
BAZAY: Suit yourself.
I'll be back in the morning.

15:33.653 --> 15:34.577
Good luck.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.533
HOUDINI: <i>So, huh</i>... what's in this?

15:43.146 --> 15:46.328
Only what Mother Earth provides. Figured
you wouldn't want to drink the water.

Ohho! She knows how to throw a party.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.460
I've... seen you in LaPier.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.035
<i>You're not afraid to be there?</i>

16:03.164 --> 16:04.622
I don't fear justice.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.675
That's what happened
to LaPier? Justice?

16:06.746 --> 16:08.977
Some sort of... revenge?

16:09.626 --> 16:11.253
For crimes against our people.

16:11.484 --> 16:12.746
Huh. You did it?

16:14.666 --> 16:15.671
Mother Earth did it.

16:17.564 --> 16:20.880
A long time ago, a young prospector
came to our valley and found copper.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.271
He said we would
all share in the bounty.

16:25.706 --> 16:27.217
He came back with many men.

16:27.857 --> 16:29.244
Forced us off our land.

16:29.626 --> 16:31.066
Some of us went peacefully.

16:31.900 --> 16:35.380
Relocated here
to their abandoned cabins.

16:36.675 --> 16:37.831
Most were killed.

16:40.140 --> 16:41.946
Now we call this valley "MikoEw,"

16:42.986 --> 16:44.222
"stained with blood".

16:47.342 --> 16:49.795
We have waited a long time
for our day of reckoning.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.577
Children died in LaPier.

16:53.288 --> 16:54.524
Call that justice?

16:55.582 --> 16:56.880
Our children died too.

16:57.511 --> 16:59.182
As Galen LaPier did yesterday.

17:00.257 --> 17:01.946
The young prospector is no more.

17:02.942 --> 17:04.808
You had nothing to do with the deaths?

17:06.693 --> 17:07.982
We did not take lives.

17:09.164 --> 17:11.208
But it's because of our losses
that lives were taken.

17:13.537 --> 17:15.200
A lie comes at a great price.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.284
To both believer and the liar.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.194
Oh... you're not joining us?

17:43.740 --> 17:48.340
- You're Sherlock's father.
- Ah... Well, yes, but he died.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.751
- In a story.
- He was born in a story.

17:52.186 --> 17:52.808
Hm.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.648
I like him.

17:55.537 --> 17:57.475
Grew rather fond of him myself,
for a while.

18:01.733 --> 18:03.297
A lot of things happened.

18:25.208 --> 18:28.044
Every night.
I dream we return to our home.

18:31.493 --> 18:32.764
As real as this.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.333
So how do you tell the difference?

18:38.346 --> 18:39.884
There is no difference.

It is all life.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.764
Yet. I suggest we sleep in shifts.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.897
Well, I'm wide awake.
I'll take the first shift. You go.

Hey. Here.

Thanks for the loan.
It was a good read.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.493
DOYLE: All seems to be well here.

20:26.186 --> 20:28.000
Which means it may be time
for a new theory.

20:28.097 --> 20:29.431
- You got one?
- No.

I was reading about dreams.

So I wrote this note to myself.
-

20:39.404 --> 20:41.146
DOYLE: Why do you feel
you need this test?

20:42.453 --> 20:44.311
This is about
your "obsessed fan", isn't it?

20:45.070 --> 20:46.728
You've had inexplicable visions of her

20:46.736 --> 20:48.400
and you're desperate
to prove they're dreams.

20:48.460 --> 20:51.173
Otherwise, it could mean
you've been seeing a ghost.

20:51.220 --> 20:53.136
- You'd love that.
- You'd never tell me anyway.

20:53.180 --> 20:54.256
Cos it wouldn't be true.

20:54.416 --> 20:56.544
Are you telling me that if, right now...

20:56.952 --> 20:59.728
you were to see your mother...

21:00.088 --> 21:03.384
standing before you,
a clear distinct image of her,

21:03.720 --> 21:06.224
that you still wouldn't accept it
as evidence of the afterlife?

21:06.310 --> 21:08.400
- It'll never happen.
- Hypothetically?

21:08.420 --> 21:10.312
- No. I wouldn't accept it.
- So, how would you explain it?

21:10.368 --> 21:13.304
Simple. It would mean
I was going insane.

21:22.336 --> 21:23.640
Look at this inscription.

21:24.744 --> 21:26.224
DOYLE: "Has everything a purpose
and a mission?"

21:27.008 --> 21:28.216
It's a quote from the book.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.816
I hadn't looked at it in years,
and then the other day...

21:31.208 --> 21:33.464
I saw this in the paper you gave me.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.840
It's the same quote.

There are a lot
of Twain fans over here.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.272
What if it isn't a coincidence?

21:41.392 --> 21:44.144
Then maybe it's... a cipher.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.232
A key to unlock a secret code
somewhere in the book.

21:48.272 --> 21:50.810

where they buried their treasure.

Not here.
In the village upriver from the mine.

22:11.620 --> 22:14.280
DOYLE: No sign of trauma.
Just like the ones in LaPier.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.080
HOUDINI: Why only three victims?

22:16.380 --> 22:18.688
This village is even closer
to the copper mines.

22:18.860 --> 22:22.080
It's not the water, it's the valley.
This village is part of the MikoEw.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.728
STRATTON: Walt had nothing to do
with this. We were with him all night.

22:26.248 --> 22:28.360
The good news is,
we have many survivors.

22:28.648 --> 22:31.344
Unfortunately, it'll be much harder
to find commonalities.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.624
Anything?

22:34.768 --> 22:36.632
We need answers.
The people here are terrified.

You should evacuate
this village immediately.

22:38.740 --> 22:41.970
47 people dead there. Another three
here. Where next? Battersea?

That's 20,000 people.

the whole village to Toronto.

22:51.434 --> 22:54.050

22:55.362 --> 22:57.321
Well, come on. Give me something.

22:57.670 --> 22:58.987
I did have a thought.

22:59.082 --> 23:01.348
The three victims: a 10-year-old boy,

23:01.428 --> 23:03.362
a healthy 70-year-old-woman

23:03.387 --> 23:05.854
and a 26-year-old man with a broken leg
_

23:05.918 --> 23:07.156
did have something in common.

23:07.536 --> 23:09.683
When they died, they were all in bed.

23:09.958 --> 23:11.467
The first two had retired

23:11.649 --> 23:13.971
and the third was laid up
because of his leg.

23:14.667 --> 23:16.664
- OK. And?
- And...

23:17.167 --> 23:18.847
that's it.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.569
I said I had a thought, not a solution.

23:21.610 --> 23:23.930

23:26.392 --> 23:29.272

Pails, woollen, lead.

repeat several times.

23:32.177 --> 23:35.777

23:35.912 --> 23:39.647
And the numbers 32nd page, 64th
word, second and fourth letter?

23:39.672 --> 23:41.812
And when this quote appears,
it signals that what follows

23:41.837 --> 23:43.056
is an encrypted message.

23:43.081 --> 23:46.401
- Without this book, there's no message.

London immediately.

23:59.207 --> 24:00.967
What about the people here?

24:00.992 --> 24:02.233
It's the King of England.

24:02.289 --> 24:04.567
His murder could throw
the whole empire into chaos.

24:04.592 --> 24:06.686
Which is why
he'll be replaced overnight.

24:06.711 --> 24:09.592

"Oh, hey, long live the King."

- That sounded weird.

24:16.234 --> 24:17.583
DOYLE: The King's just one person.

24:17.608 --> 24:20.686
If you can save more lives by staying
here, I think you should.

24:21.412 --> 24:22.618

in the first place?

24:25.823 --> 24:27.507
The inscription wasn't
in his handwriting.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.386
The Home Office must
have given it to him.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.232
Yeah. I'd want to believe that, too.

24:31.834 --> 24:34.860
Your dead husband shows up,
begging you to drop the case.

24:34.885 --> 24:36.725
Why? Because he cares about you?

24:36.750 --> 24:39.830
This coming from a man who let you
find him hanging from a rafter.

24:40.056 --> 24:40.900
You didn't know him.

24:40.931 --> 24:42.789
All I need to know is
that he lied to you.

24:43.343 --> 24:44.917
And that you still love him.

24:46.184 --> 24:47.167
Perhaps.

24:47.749 --> 24:49.247
But if he was on the
wrong side of this,

24:49.272 --> 24:51.112
he'd be in London right now, not here.

24:51.378 --> 24:53.825
And if he is a good guy,
he needs to be informed immediately.

24:53.850 --> 24:57.415
But if he is not... the last thing
you want to do is tip him off.

24:58.608 --> 24:59.928
Your call.

25:04.893 --> 25:06.386
I'll inform Merring.

In high enough concentrations,

I read about

29:10.352 --> 29:12.592
People noticed that as
they descended with their pet,

it would pass out because carbon
dioxide was collecting along the ground.

29:19.470 --> 29:22.960
There is no link
between Libby and Farley.

29:24.410 --> 29:28.520
She survived because
her Addison's caused alkalosis,

29:28.550 --> 29:32.850
a deficiency of CO2, which allowed
her to tolerate an excess of it.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.800
An excess that would
have killed anyone else.

the gas, the belfry, for example.

this tidal wave come from?

29:57.210 --> 29:58.310

29:59.110 --> 30:01.260
The mine must have tapped
into a pocket of the gas,

30:01.290 --> 30:02.510
unleashing a deadly wave,

which surged through the village,
maybe ten or 20 feet high,

30:12.970 --> 30:14.870
they were just
a few feet off the ground.

30:14.890 --> 30:17.710
If the gas is heavier than air,
how did it travel uphill?

30:18.180 --> 30:19.900
There's another entrance
to the mine upriver.

30:19.950 --> 30:21.290
DOYLE: It's still flowing out.

30:21.350 --> 30:23.590
The match tells us that the wave
is now only a foot deep.

But who knows what might
happen in the future?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.930

30:47.610 --> 30:49.460
Which is why I can't
let you go with me.

30:50.510 --> 30:52.900
I couldn't live with myself if
anything happened to either of you.

31:03.730 --> 31:06.770
No mine.
Everyone's gonna be moving out.

31:06.810 --> 31:08.980
Looks like the MikoEw is yours again.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.410
Mother Earth moves
in a mysterious way.

31:14.310 --> 31:16.670
The preacher said something
very similar to that.

31:16.950 --> 31:18.120
He's a good man.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.930
He and the girl
are welcome to stay with us.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.680
Uh, the preacher's moving to Kingston.

31:24.432 --> 31:27.472
The little girl's moving in
with her aunt.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.010
It's nice of you to offer.

31:29.110 --> 31:31.840
Especially since not many
would offer you the same.

31:32.150 --> 31:33.580
I have what is in my heart.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.970
No matter what they have in theirs.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.170
I just lost my mother.

31:48.010 --> 31:50.000
And it's... killing me.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.030
<i>She is not lost.</i>

31:54.870 --> 31:56.230
Do you believe in the afterlife?

31:57.280 --> 31:59.000
There is no before or after.

32:01.700 --> 32:02.980
It is all life.

32:03.270 --> 32:07.510
The body returns to
the earth, and the spirit stays here.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.190
What? As a ghost?

32:10.590 --> 32:11.810
As part of us.

32:12.230 --> 32:14.110
I am everyone who has died before me.

32:15.200 --> 32:19.000
My father, my wife, my sons...

32:21.730 --> 32:23.020
They live here now.

32:24.430 --> 32:25.980
Your mother is not lost.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.070
She's home.

32:34.190 --> 32:35.080
Thank you.

32:46.420 --> 32:48.200
She says,
"Say hello to the President."

32:50.160 --> 32:51.690
He's coming to Buffalo tomorrow.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.280

32:59.302 --> 33:00.670

33:00.700 --> 33:03.260

tomorrow, September 2nd.

33:03.620 --> 33:06.000
And he's staying
at the King Edward Hotel.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.740
STRATTON: The target isn't the King.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.520
It's the President
of the United States.

33:26.770 --> 33:29.628
You must be Houdini.
Agent Branowski. I got your telegram.

33:29.817 --> 33:32.291
- It's just you?
- Until I can confirm your information.

33:32.308 --> 33:33.805
- DOYLE: There's no time for that.
- Where's the President?

33:33.931 --> 33:35.885
He's in his suite, getting
ready for his appearance.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.268
They could be planning
to get him on his way out.

33:37.302 --> 33:39.920
- Take me to him.
- I can't do that until I can confirm...

33:39.930 --> 33:41.751
I'm Constable Stratton
of Scotland Yard.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.955

If we're wrong, you'll look like a fool.
If we're right,

33:47.502 --> 33:49.520
you'll save the President's life.
You pick.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.111
Just Mr Houdini.

33:55.884 --> 33:58.231
You check the lobby.
I'll cover the mezzanine.

33:59.546 --> 34:02.773
BRANOWSKI: You should know, the
President is very sceptical of rumours.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.506
Sounds like my type of guy.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.650

34:36.630 --> 34:38.808
You're not gonna talk him out of
making his appearance.

34:38.853 --> 34:41.333
Then he's just got
a brand new bodyguard.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.982

35:53.324 --> 35:54.337
Pleased to meet you.

35:56.337 --> 35:58.195
I believe we're both here
for the same reason.

36:00.986 --> 36:04.213
To stop the assassination
of the President of the United States.

36:05.644 --> 36:06.995

I'm sorry, Penny.

37:09.191 --> 37:10.577
I tried to warn you.

You left me that note.

You vandalised my flat.

What are you doing here?

38:57.840 --> 38:58.951
The fact is...

38:59.706 --> 39:01.644
that as you drift toward oblivion,

39:01.660 --> 39:04.560
you're compiling
your dreary list of regrets.

that topping the list is...
