WEBVTT

00:03.022 --> 00:05.436
So Sheldon, there's something I've
been wanting to talk about

00:05.437 --> 00:07.337
but I know it's
kind of a touchy subject.

00:07.339 --> 00:09.540
Way to narrow it down
to everything.

00:11.110 --> 00:12.543
What is it?

00:12.545 --> 00:13.877
Well, your birthday's coming up.

00:13.879 --> 00:15.078
And you've never
let us celebrate it.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.014
And I was hoping maybe
this year we could.

00:17.016 --> 00:20.317
Oh, I suppose that's
a discussion we could have.

00:24.990 --> 00:27.157
Okay, great, I mean,

00:27.159 --> 00:29.760
it doesn't have to be
a big party or anything.

00:29.762 --> 00:31.962
I was just...

00:34.166 --> 00:35.899
Where'd he go?

00:35.901 --> 00:37.067
W-Wait a minute.

00:37.069 --> 00:39.469
You mention his birthday
and he vanishes?

00:39.471 --> 00:42.773
Well, where's that information
been this whole time?

01:15.039 --> 01:16.672
Well, where is he?

01:16.674 --> 01:17.806
Sheldon?

01:17.808 --> 01:18.841
I'll check his room.

01:18.843 --> 01:20.175
Surprise!

01:20.177 --> 01:21.310
Oh, my God!

01:21.312 --> 01:23.279
Just one example

01:23.281 --> 01:25.881
of how birthdays
can be terrible.

01:25.883 --> 01:28.150
Now, can we please

01:28.152 --> 01:29.518
drop this subject
and pick a new one?

01:29.520 --> 01:32.054
Yeah, I suggest
“how thick can a soup get

01:32.056 --> 01:33.556
before it becomes a stew?”

01:33.558 --> 01:35.991
You know, the answer,
it may surprise you.

01:35.993 --> 01:38.861
I'm sorry I brought it up.

01:38.863 --> 01:40.095
Yeah, what is the problem?

01:40.097 --> 01:41.130
Is it about getting older?

01:41.132 --> 01:43.566
Please, look at this
porcelain skin.

01:43.568 --> 01:46.368
I'm like a human sink.

01:47.672 --> 01:51.574
But it's the one day a year
that's just all about you.

01:51.576 --> 01:53.542
One day.

01:56.881 --> 01:58.147
Right.

02:00.084 --> 02:02.051
Can you please just tell me why?

02:02.053 --> 02:05.120
Fine.

02:05.122 --> 02:07.289
As you know,
I have a twin sister

02:07.291 --> 02:09.792
with whom I obviously
share a birthday.

02:09.794 --> 02:11.827
Every year we'd
have a party.

02:11.829 --> 02:13.395
No one I invited
would ever come,

02:13.397 --> 02:14.830
because they didn't like me.

02:15.967 --> 02:17.566
I'm sorry.

02:17.568 --> 02:18.801
Oh, that part wasn't so bad.

02:18.803 --> 02:20.002
I didn't like them, either.

02:20.004 --> 02:21.670
But then I'd inevitably spend

02:21.672 --> 02:25.240
the whole day being tortured
by my sister's friends.

02:25.242 --> 02:27.142
Oh, you poor thing.

02:27.144 --> 02:29.478
When I was six, they told me
Batman was coming to my party.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.347
I waited by the
door for hours.

02:31.349 --> 02:33.382
Closest thing
to Batman I saw

02:33.384 --> 02:35.618
was when a robin
flew into the window.

02:37.388 --> 02:40.055
You realize none of those things
would happen now?

02:40.057 --> 02:41.957
I do, but why do you care

02:41.959 --> 02:44.093
if I celebrate
my birthday at all?

02:44.095 --> 02:47.296
Well, you made
my last birthday so memorable,

02:47.298 --> 02:49.264
I wanted to return the favor.

02:49.266 --> 02:50.432
Yeah, if you had

02:50.434 --> 02:51.900
a party now, you
have plenty of friends

02:51.902 --> 02:53.102
that would love to come.

02:53.104 --> 02:54.703
And we live here,
so we have no choice.

02:54.705 --> 02:56.739
Yeah.

02:57.975 --> 02:59.241
Very well.

02:59.243 --> 03:01.210
You may celebrate my life
by throwing a party

03:01.212 --> 03:04.279
with cake, presents and a
shower of admiration and love.

03:04.281 --> 03:06.482
But then you owe me big-time.

03:08.986 --> 03:11.086
You have any idea
what you're getting

03:11.088 --> 03:12.488
Sheldon for his birthday?

03:12.490 --> 03:14.657
He's been fascinated
with dinosaurs lately.

03:14.659 --> 03:16.025
Maybe we could get him a fossil.

03:16.027 --> 03:18.027
Well, just don't
get anything Jurassic.

03:18.029 --> 03:21.497
He feels like that whole chunk
of time has gone Hollywood.

03:23.134 --> 03:25.434
Hey, uh, you know,

03:25.436 --> 03:28.103
he told a sad story
about how his sister

03:28.105 --> 03:31.407
tricked him into thinking Batman
was coming to his party.

03:31.409 --> 03:32.741
That's funny.

03:32.743 --> 03:34.510
Let's do that.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.013
Maybe we could get Batman
to actually show up.

03:38.015 --> 03:40.616
You mean, some guy
in a lame suit?

03:40.618 --> 03:42.885
Or a real Batman.
Hey, Stuart?

03:42.887 --> 03:45.454
Didn't you try to get Adam West
to do a signing here once?

03:45.456 --> 03:47.956
Yeah, but there was kind of
a scheduling conflict.

03:47.958 --> 03:50.893
He, uh, wanted to know
when he'd get paid.

03:50.895 --> 03:52.828
And I wouldn't tell him.

03:54.298 --> 03:56.231
Can I get his contact info?

03:56.233 --> 03:58.634
Sure, uh, but
just so you know,

03:58.636 --> 03:59.968
he's kind of a diva.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.837
He is?
Oh, yeah.

04:01.839 --> 04:02.938
Won't take the bus.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.239
He won't pack his own lunch.

04:04.241 --> 04:07.710
Won't let you spend
the night on his couch.

04:09.847 --> 04:12.915
Okay, so how do you feel
about party balloons?

04:12.917 --> 04:14.550
Uh, Mylar balloons, yes.

04:14.552 --> 04:16.151
Latex balloons, no.

04:16.153 --> 04:18.286
Water balloons,
I will jump off the roof

04:18.289 --> 04:20.488
and aim for your car.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.592
All right, what about music?

04:23.594 --> 04:24.993
I enjoy marching bands

04:24.995 --> 04:27.730
and Tibetan throat singing.

04:27.732 --> 04:29.164
No music it is.

04:30.434 --> 04:31.767
What kind of cake
do you like?

04:31.769 --> 04:34.703
Well, my favorite is chocolate
with strawberry frosting,

04:34.705 --> 04:36.572
three layers,
and if there's

04:36.574 --> 04:38.340
writing on it,
make sure it's not all caps.

04:38.342 --> 04:41.844
I don't need my dessert
yelling at me.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.915
Hey, so what was
Adam West like on the phone?

04:46.917 --> 04:48.217
Uh, nice guy.

04:48.219 --> 04:49.918
But it was a little weird
to hear Batman say,

04:49.920 --> 04:53.856
“Don't ring the doorbell
or my poodles will go crazy.”

04:53.858 --> 04:56.859
You know, Adam West
is my favorite Batman?

04:56.861 --> 04:58.160
Well,

04:58.162 --> 05:00.496
after Michael Keaton,
Christian Bale

05:00.498 --> 05:02.731
and Batman from
<i>The Lego Movie.</i>

05:04.001 --> 05:05.300
Don't say that to him.

05:05.302 --> 05:07.669
What?
He beat out George Clooney.

05:07.671 --> 05:08.670
And that's something.

05:08.672 --> 05:11.039
Like, I love me
some Clooney.

05:11.041 --> 05:13.442
Don't say that to anyone.

05:15.679 --> 05:18.046
Thank you so much
for helping us, Stuart.

05:18.048 --> 05:19.748
Oh, I-I was just

05:19.750 --> 05:21.416
glad to be invited.

05:21.418 --> 05:24.453
To be honest, I don't always
feel like I'm part of the group.

05:24.455 --> 05:25.621
Okay, sweetie,
we're on the clock here.

05:25.623 --> 05:28.123
Can you hate yourself
and frost at the same time?

05:29.426 --> 05:31.960
Hello, I hope I'm not too early.

05:31.962 --> 05:32.895
No, no, no. Come on in.

05:32.897 --> 05:35.464
And how is the radiant
mommy-to-be?

05:35.466 --> 05:36.932
Doing great.

05:36.934 --> 05:38.967
Y-You're pregnant?

05:38.969 --> 05:39.935
Yeah.

05:39.937 --> 05:41.937
Sounds like something

05:41.939 --> 05:44.907
a member of the group
might know.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.175
Yeah, birthday party first.

05:46.177 --> 05:48.243
Pity party later.

05:50.815 --> 05:52.047
Are you crazy?

05:52.049 --> 05:53.749
How can you put Michael Keaton

05:53.751 --> 05:56.084
in front of Christian Bale?

05:56.086 --> 05:58.253
Oh, please.

06:00.224 --> 06:03.725
Even my poodles know
Bale's overrated.

06:03.727 --> 06:05.794
Thank you!

06:05.796 --> 06:07.696
That's why I say
Keaton's number one.

06:07.698 --> 06:09.364
He brought a sense
of humor to the role.

06:09.366 --> 06:11.466
Oh, if you're gonna
factor in a sense of humor,

06:11.468 --> 06:14.636
then I should be
at the top of the list.

06:14.638 --> 06:17.472
It should be me,

06:17.474 --> 06:18.607
Keaton, Kilmer,

06:18.609 --> 06:20.242
Lego, Bale,

06:20.244 --> 06:22.444
and that pretty boy Clooney.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.181
Really?

06:26.183 --> 06:27.749
You're ahead of Bale?

06:27.751 --> 06:29.718
The man who personified
the words,

06:29.720 --> 06:32.754
“I'm Batman.”

06:32.756 --> 06:34.356
I never had to say I'm Batman.

06:34.358 --> 06:35.557
I showed up.

06:35.559 --> 06:38.026
People knew I was Batman.

06:39.296 --> 06:41.697
Everywhere I went--
on the TV show,

06:41.699 --> 06:42.898
mall openings...

06:42.900 --> 06:46.068
Julie Newmar's bungalow.

06:48.739 --> 06:51.173
I'm sold-- you're ahead of Bale.

06:52.309 --> 06:54.877
There's another reason
I should be higher on the list.

06:54.879 --> 06:56.311
All those other guys

06:56.313 --> 06:59.448
had muscles built
into their costumes.

06:59.450 --> 07:01.717
All I had in my Batsuit

07:01.719 --> 07:05.687
was 100%, grade-A West.

07:08.459 --> 07:10.893
Can we just all agree
we're worried about Affleck?

07:10.895 --> 07:13.028
Sure.
Yeah, of course.

07:14.365 --> 07:16.365
What's an Affleck?

07:19.303 --> 07:22.004
Is there a reason I had
to leave my own apartment?

07:22.006 --> 07:23.672
Well, I think
they just want you to see it

07:23.674 --> 07:25.274
for the first time
all decorated.

07:25.276 --> 07:28.944
But who's gonna tell them
they're doing it wrong?

07:28.946 --> 07:32.180
Well, I'm... I'm sure they'll
ask you to give a speech,

07:32.182 --> 07:34.917
and that's when
you just tear 'em a new one.

07:34.919 --> 07:37.819
Have to say, you...

07:37.821 --> 07:39.755
you do look good in that suit.

07:39.757 --> 07:41.189
Oh. Thank you.

07:41.191 --> 07:43.325
Maybe later I'll, uh...

07:43.327 --> 07:47.062
get to see you
in your birthday suit.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.000
But this <i>is</i> my
birthday suit.

07:53.437 --> 07:56.204
Are you having a stroke?

07:57.641 --> 07:58.840
Because that's the kind of thing

07:58.842 --> 08:00.275
that just ruins
a birthday party.

08:02.713 --> 08:05.247
So, Mother, I'm surprised
you came all this way

08:05.249 --> 08:06.348
for Sheldon's birthday.

08:06.350 --> 08:07.482
Oh, I was happy to.

08:07.484 --> 08:09.418
He did come to my 60th.

08:09.420 --> 08:13.288
Oh. You had a party
for your 60th?

08:13.290 --> 08:15.590
Oh, I wouldn't call it a party.

08:15.592 --> 08:17.559
Just a few close friends.

08:18.963 --> 08:20.929
And your sister and brother.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.701
You know, to be fair,
we did get married in Vegas

08:25.703 --> 08:26.735
and didn't invite her.

08:26.737 --> 08:29.638
And I never did thank you
for that, dear.

08:32.241 --> 08:34.042
Oh.

08:34.044 --> 08:37.044
Penny says everyone's there.
Are you ready?

08:37.047 --> 08:39.648
I am.

08:46.991 --> 08:49.257
Oh. Wait.
Are you all right?

08:49.259 --> 08:52.094
No, I just...
I got a little light-headed.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.528
Oh, d-do you need a minute?

08:53.530 --> 08:55.664
No.

08:55.666 --> 08:58.000
No, if I can walk
past that pet shop

08:58.002 --> 09:01.436
with the parrot in the window,
I suppose I can do this.

09:06.377 --> 09:08.844
Happy birthday!

09:10.647 --> 09:11.980
Speech! Speech!

09:12.750 --> 09:14.850
Come on, Sheldon,
say something.

09:14.852 --> 09:16.084
Uh, um...

09:16.086 --> 09:18.587
uh, thank you all
so much for coming.

09:18.589 --> 09:19.821
Uh, Beverly.

09:19.823 --> 09:21.823
Wil Wheaton.

09:21.825 --> 09:24.326
Adam West,
for some reason.

09:25.696 --> 09:28.463
Batman finally came
to your party.

09:28.465 --> 09:31.199
Happy birthday, Sherman.

09:34.371 --> 09:35.804
Thank you.

09:35.806 --> 09:37.672
This is all so thoughtful.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:46.316 --> 09:48.150
Excuse me.

09:55.492 --> 09:57.359
I still get paid, don't I?

10:06.859 --> 10:09.326
Okay, I'd better go in
there and talk to him.

10:09.328 --> 10:11.295
Well, don't you think
I'm the one who should go in?

10:11.297 --> 10:14.098
No offense, but I've known
the guy a really long time.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.966
Well, I've, you know,

10:15.968 --> 10:18.702
seen him without pants on.

10:19.505 --> 10:22.639
Again, no offense,
but so have I.

10:22.641 --> 10:24.908
Well, he's seen me
without pants on.

10:24.910 --> 10:25.876
Again, no...

10:25.878 --> 10:28.078
Okay, this is ridiculous.

10:31.183 --> 10:32.082
Sheldon?

10:32.084 --> 10:33.083
Can I come in?

10:34.453 --> 10:37.087
How do you know I'm not using
the facilities?

10:37.089 --> 10:39.857
Because you e-mail me your
bathroom schedule once a week,

10:39.859 --> 10:41.425
even though
I've clicked unsubscribe,

10:41.427 --> 10:42.960
like, a thousand times.

10:49.201 --> 10:50.868
So...

10:50.870 --> 10:52.503
what's going on?

10:52.505 --> 10:53.904
I don't know.

10:53.906 --> 10:55.639
I-I looked around the room,

10:55.641 --> 10:57.741
and I saw all the faces
and the presents,

10:57.743 --> 11:00.110
and it... it was just too much.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.646
I get that.

11:04.884 --> 11:07.284
Hey, you want to just bring
a few people in here?

11:07.286 --> 11:09.186
You know,
Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,

11:09.188 --> 11:11.522
Batman on the toilet.

11:11.524 --> 11:13.724
It'll be like
the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

11:16.562 --> 11:18.829
I know that you worked hard
to put this together.

11:18.831 --> 11:20.330
I'm sorry I'm ruining it.

11:20.332 --> 11:21.598
Oh, pl...
You're not ruining it.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.634
Look, at some point,
Raj will try to get everyone

11:23.636 --> 11:24.935
to do the Electric Slide.

11:24.937 --> 11:26.637
Now, that will ruin it.

11:28.407 --> 11:30.808
I don't think
I can go back out there.

11:31.610 --> 11:33.377
That's fine.

11:44.690 --> 11:47.191
You know, I hate that
your sister and her friends

11:47.193 --> 11:49.493
used to torture you.

11:49.495 --> 11:51.228
But what I hate even more

11:51.230 --> 11:54.765
is, if I was there,
I would have tortured you, too.

11:56.936 --> 11:59.903
Based on this pep talk,
I'd say you're still doing it.

11:59.905 --> 12:02.339
My point is,

12:02.341 --> 12:04.308
there was a time I never
would've been friends

12:04.310 --> 12:06.510
with someone like you,
and now...

12:06.512 --> 12:08.245
you are one
of my favorite people.

12:08.247 --> 12:10.581
So, if what you need is

12:10.583 --> 12:13.250
to spend your birthday
in a bathroom,

12:13.252 --> 12:16.386
I'm happy to do it with you.

12:18.057 --> 12:20.290
Well, everyone will
think I'm weird.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.500
Sweetie, you are weird.

12:30.803 --> 12:32.703
Everyone knows you're weird,

12:32.705 --> 12:33.971
but they're all still here

12:33.973 --> 12:36.540
because they care
about you so much.

12:37.743 --> 12:38.842
Hello.

12:38.844 --> 12:40.277
Some of us need
to check our hair

12:40.279 --> 12:43.247
because we might have a shot
with Leonard's mother.

12:46.552 --> 12:48.485
Leonard.
Hey.

12:48.487 --> 12:49.753
It's been a while.

12:49.755 --> 12:50.888
Leslie.

12:50.890 --> 12:52.523
I can't remember
the last time we talked.

12:52.525 --> 12:54.258
So much has changed.

12:55.895 --> 12:58.228
Has it?

12:59.698 --> 13:01.632
Yeah, uh, um,
Penny and I got married.

13:01.634 --> 13:03.066
Wow, congratulations.

13:03.068 --> 13:04.334
You know, actually,

13:04.336 --> 13:06.103
I thought you'd be living
with Sheldon forever.

13:06.105 --> 13:08.038
Yeah, well...

13:09.808 --> 13:11.074
Don't be a stranger.

13:12.144 --> 13:14.111
Okay, everybody,

13:14.113 --> 13:15.345
Sheldon is gonna come back out,

13:15.347 --> 13:16.680
but I think
he's a little embarrassed,

13:16.682 --> 13:19.316
so let's all be
extra nice, okay?

13:19.318 --> 13:20.751
What are you
looking at me for?

13:20.753 --> 13:22.185
I'm a saint.

13:22.187 --> 13:24.187
But a sinner in the sack.

13:28.193 --> 13:29.493
Hello, everyone.

13:29.495 --> 13:30.594
I-I...

13:30.596 --> 13:32.462
I'd like to apologize
for my behavior.

13:32.464 --> 13:35.198
I hope it hasn't put
a damper on the party.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.167
So, just, please,
enjoy yourselves.

13:37.169 --> 13:38.335
That's good.

13:41.807 --> 13:44.207
Oh, this is quickly
getting out of hand.

13:44.209 --> 13:46.276
If I may,

13:46.278 --> 13:48.579
I-I'd like to propose a toast.

13:48.581 --> 13:50.981
Um, thank you all
for coming tonight.

13:50.983 --> 13:52.049
I know it's customary

13:52.051 --> 13:54.985
for the birthday boy
to receive presents,

13:54.987 --> 13:57.220
but I feel like I got
the greatest gift

13:57.222 --> 13:58.589
the day he was born.

13:58.591 --> 13:59.623
Aw.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.625
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

14:01.627 --> 14:03.961
Amy, that was lovely.

14:03.963 --> 14:05.462
You know,

14:05.464 --> 14:06.430
this is fun.

14:06.432 --> 14:07.598
Let's do more.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.900
Someone else say something
wonderful about me.

14:09.902 --> 14:12.202
Sheldon,
I don't think everyone...

14:12.204 --> 14:14.304
Wolowitz, perfect.
Everyone listen to Wolowitz.

14:15.608 --> 14:17.374
Okay, then, uh,

14:17.376 --> 14:19.142
Sheldon,

14:19.144 --> 14:20.777
we've known each other
a long time.

14:20.779 --> 14:24.147
And it is a pleasure
to work with you

14:24.149 --> 14:25.816
and call you my friend.

14:25.818 --> 14:27.551
Little generic. Keep thinking.
We'll circle back.

14:27.553 --> 14:29.052
Wil Wheaton, go.

14:30.556 --> 14:33.890
Sheldon, I know that we've had
our ups and downs,

14:33.892 --> 14:35.959
but I can honestly say

14:35.961 --> 14:37.461
that my life is
so much more interesting

14:37.463 --> 14:38.662
because you are in it.

14:38.664 --> 14:42.165
We may have met because
you are a fan of <i>Star Trek.</i>

14:42.167 --> 14:44.635
But I have become
a fan of Sheldon Cooper.

14:44.637 --> 14:46.403
Live long and prosper,
buddy.

14:46.405 --> 14:47.471
And happy birthday.

14:47.473 --> 14:48.739
Cheers.

14:48.741 --> 14:51.008
That's how you do it, Wolowitz.

14:51.010 --> 14:53.043
Now you see

14:53.045 --> 14:54.511
why he's famous and you're not.

14:56.915 --> 14:58.448
Sheldon,

14:58.450 --> 15:00.917
I know the future holds
great things for you,

15:00.919 --> 15:03.620
and we all can't wait to see
what they are.

15:03.622 --> 15:05.856
Happy birthday, dear.

15:05.858 --> 15:07.758
Cheers.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.292
Someone call Animal Control.

15:09.294 --> 15:11.862
There's a cougar on the loose.

15:13.165 --> 15:14.598
Barry, stop.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.233
Seriously, Barry, stop.

15:18.137 --> 15:21.271
And it was Gandhi who said,

15:21.273 --> 15:23.640
“Live as if you were to

15:23.642 --> 15:25.809
“die tomorrow.

15:25.811 --> 15:28.211
“Learn as if you were to live

15:28.213 --> 15:29.613
forever.”

15:29.615 --> 15:31.248
And it was Sheldon Cooper who
said “Let's speed this up.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.717
A lot of people want to talk”"

15:33.719 --> 15:36.620
Uh, in the past, I would've said
something obnoxious,

15:36.622 --> 15:38.889
like, “Happy birthday, dumbass”.

15:38.891 --> 15:40.991
But I'm not gonna do it.

15:40.993 --> 15:42.659
You and I have both grown a lot,

15:42.661 --> 15:45.262
and it's just so nice
to see you all again.

15:45.264 --> 15:46.663
So...

15:46.665 --> 15:48.065
happy birthday, Sheldon.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.366
Oh.

15:49.368 --> 15:51.435
Oh, now, you know I hate change.
Say it.

15:51.437 --> 15:53.036
Happy birthday, dumbass!

15:54.873 --> 15:56.540
Happy birthday, young man.

15:56.542 --> 16:00.043
And if any of you have enjoyed
seeing me here today,

16:00.045 --> 16:02.646
I'm also available
for Comic-Cons,

16:02.648 --> 16:05.782
bachelor parties,
bar mitzvahs...

16:05.784 --> 16:09.319
I can't think of anything to say
that hasn't already been said.

16:09.321 --> 16:11.555
So, here's to you, Sheldon.

16:11.557 --> 16:12.889
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

16:12.891 --> 16:14.157
Thank you, Bernadette.

16:14.159 --> 16:15.425
That was perfect.

16:15.427 --> 16:18.929
What? You gotta be kidding me?

16:18.931 --> 16:21.364
Sheldon, we've been
together so long,

16:21.366 --> 16:24.000
it's hard to remember a time
you weren't in my life.

16:24.002 --> 16:25.502
And believe me, I try.

16:27.272 --> 16:28.638
You make me laugh.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.841
You make me a better scientist.

16:30.843 --> 16:32.342
You make me crazy.

16:32.344 --> 16:33.944
You're more than just
my roommate,

16:33.946 --> 16:35.679
you're my brother.

16:36.448 --> 16:37.581
Thank you.

16:37.583 --> 16:38.982
Happy birthday, buddy.

16:38.984 --> 16:40.817
Cheers.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.587
Thank you.
That-that was wonderful.

16:43.589 --> 16:44.654
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:44.656 --> 16:46.523
Stuart didn't get to speak.

16:46.525 --> 16:48.892
Oh, oh, okay. Um...

16:48.894 --> 16:50.794
Uh, Sheldon,

16:50.796 --> 16:52.829
I've spent most of my life
feeling invisible,

16:52.831 --> 16:54.898
but having you and everyone...

16:54.900 --> 16:56.867
Hey, everybody, listen up.

16:58.070 --> 17:00.837
You nailed it.

17:00.839 --> 17:02.773
We've got someone
who couldn't be here

17:02.775 --> 17:04.007
but really wanted to wish you

17:04.009 --> 17:05.709
a happy birthday.

17:06.845 --> 17:07.911
Hello, Sheldon.

17:09.348 --> 17:11.281
Professor Hawking.

17:11.282 --> 17:13.349
Happy birthday to you.

17:13.352 --> 17:14.550
Thank you so much.

17:14.553 --> 17:15.519
I can't believe you're...

17:15.521 --> 17:16.685
Happy birthday to you.

17:16.688 --> 17:18.855
Oh, you're singing.
Well, I'm sorry.

17:20.492 --> 17:22.358
Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.

17:22.361 --> 17:23.492
Uh, Professor Hawking,

17:23.494 --> 17:25.295
if you just give us
one second,

17:25.297 --> 17:27.631
we'll light the candles,
and we can all sing together.

17:27.633 --> 17:30.901
I was crushing it,
but all right.

17:32.037 --> 17:33.570
Okay, while they get
the cake,

17:33.572 --> 17:35.138
Sheldon,
I just want to say,

17:35.140 --> 17:36.907
I hope you didn't think you were
gonna get through tonight

17:36.909 --> 17:38.008
without a hug.

17:39.278 --> 17:40.877
You know, I used to hate
these hugs.

17:44.216 --> 17:46.383
Now they're just
extremely irritating.

17:55.663 --> 17:57.596
Ready when you are,
Professor Hawking.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.098
And a one, and a two...

18:00.100 --> 18:04.770
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

18:04.772 --> 18:09.975
