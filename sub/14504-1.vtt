02:05.183 --> 02:07.383
Hello, fence.

02:16.383 --> 02:18.883
Hello, leaves.

02:22.382 --> 02:24.482
Hello, sky.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.878
Get off my lawn!

03:32.778 --> 03:34.778
Trespasser.

03:34.978 --> 03:37.078
Do you want to be eaten alive?

03:37.678 --> 03:40.078
- No.
- Then get out of here!

03:44.578 --> 03:45.978
My trike.

03:52.077 --> 03:54.877
Stay away from my house!

04:17.575 --> 04:19.175
- DJ!
- We're gonna be late.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.274
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.275
October 30th: another tricycle.

04:25.475 --> 04:27.174
I'm coming.

04:32.074 --> 04:33.474
Mom.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.774
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.

04:36.974 --> 04:39.274
Okay, honey,
we've talked about this.

04:39.474 --> 04:42.074
You cannot stay up
in your room all day...

04:42.274 --> 04:44.474
...staring at an old man
through a telescope.

04:44.674 --> 04:46.874
But, Mom, there's something wrong
with that house.

04:47.074 --> 04:48.274
I'm serious.

04:48.574 --> 04:50.374
What was that?

04:52.274 --> 04:53.674
I'm serious.

04:54.374 --> 04:56.374
His voice sounds funny.

04:56.574 --> 04:58.973
Someone is hitting puberty.

04:59.173 --> 05:02.273
"What's happening to my body?"
Right, buddy?

05:02.473 --> 05:03.973
Maybe you should come with us.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.173
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.373
I'm not spying.

05:09.773 --> 05:11.073
Well...

05:11.273 --> 05:14.373
"Well..." That's okay, buddy.

05:14.573 --> 05:16.773
When I was your age,
I did exactly the same thing.

05:16.973 --> 05:20.573
Of course, it was with binoculars
and involved the lovely Jensen twins.

05:20.773 --> 05:23.773
Neither of which was as lovely
as your beautiful mother.

05:23.973 --> 05:26.473
Will you be an angel
and help me bring out the incisor?

05:26.673 --> 05:27.873
- The incisor.
- Hold this.

05:28.073 --> 05:30.271
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.071
Elizabeth will be here
in a few hours.

05:40.271 --> 05:42.571
If anything happens,
call the police and hide.

05:42.771 --> 05:44.171
He knows that.

05:44.371 --> 05:46.771
See you tomorrow night.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.971
- What have you done?
- Just let me drive this thing, will you?

05:50.171 --> 05:51.771
- Where is DJ? Where's DJ?
- I'm fine.

05:51.970 --> 05:55.670
You would be so happy
if he was under the car, wouldn't you?

05:55.870 --> 06:00.070
Sorry. It's hard to see
with the mask on.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.769
Then why don't you keep it off,
Chowder?

06:02.969 --> 06:04.869
Why did you put up your window?

06:05.069 --> 06:06.769
- Chowder.
- It's aerodynamic.

06:06.969 --> 06:08.469
- Hi, DJ.
- We've got to make time.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.069
The children. The children.

06:10.269 --> 06:12.069
- What children?
- Bye-bye, baby.

06:12.269 --> 06:14.569
- Tell him you love him, dear.
- He knows that.

06:14.769 --> 06:17.369
- Tell your son you love him.
- I don't wanna tell him.

06:17.569 --> 06:19.069
- He knows I love him.
- He's your son.

06:19.269 --> 06:22.469
- You have to say it. Roll it down.
- We're gonna be late.

06:23.269 --> 06:24.869
We both love you.

06:25.069 --> 06:27.469
- That includes your dad.
- That's right.

06:29.869 --> 06:31.669
- He's had enough kisses.
- Blow him a kiss.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.768
- Blow him a kiss.
- Goodbye.

06:37.868 --> 06:40.368
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.768
In one day and three hours,
it's candy time.

06:44.768 --> 06:46.268
Okay?

06:47.368 --> 06:50.567
- Check it out, I got a new ball.
- Cool.

06:52.567 --> 06:54.767
Oh, speaking of which,
have you decided?

06:54.967 --> 06:58.267
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?

06:59.567 --> 07:00.967
Chowder.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.266
I don't think I'm going
trick-or-treating this year.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.766
What?

07:06.966 --> 07:09.466
Come on, you're gonna break
a six-year streak.

07:09.666 --> 07:12.366
Yeah, six years of being jumped
and egged.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.966
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.

07:24.765 --> 07:26.665
Three seconds on the clock.

07:26.865 --> 07:28.765
I'm playing basketball.

07:32.965 --> 07:36.164
It's time
for an in-your-face disgrace.

07:39.964 --> 07:42.464
- Are you okay?
- My nose is in my brains.

07:42.664 --> 07:44.364
Let me see. Oh, my God.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.064
- What?
- You're a dork.

07:48.064 --> 07:49.264
Where's my ball?

07:54.364 --> 07:55.764
Oh, no.

08:12.762 --> 08:16.162
- Sorry, man.
- Wait, wait. DJ.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.762
You're a grownup now,
you go get it.

08:18.962 --> 08:22.162
Chowder, your ball just landed
on Nebbercracker's lawn.

08:22.362 --> 08:24.661
It doesn't exist anymore.

08:29.361 --> 08:32.260
I paid $28 for that ball.

08:32.461 --> 08:36.760
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom
for a dollar 26 times.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.960
I never worked that hard in my life-

08:41.659 --> 08:43.559
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.

08:43.860 --> 08:47.360
- So?
- So maybe he's sleeping.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.060
All right, I'll do it.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.260
I'll never forget this. Hurry, though.

08:59.660 --> 09:01.060
Go.

09:10.559 --> 09:11.559
You.

09:11.859 --> 09:13.559
- No.
- DJ, run!

09:16.259 --> 09:17.959
Get the ball and run!

09:20.659 --> 09:22.559
You're so close.

09:22.759 --> 09:24.259
What have you done?

09:24.459 --> 09:26.259
- Just nudge it over here.
- I'm so sorry.

09:26.459 --> 09:29.059
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean-

09:29.259 --> 09:30.859
You are dead.

09:31.059 --> 09:32.858
DJ, come on, come on!

09:34.558 --> 09:36.058
- Chowder.
- Come on, DJ.

09:36.258 --> 09:37.958
Help. Chowder.

09:38.158 --> 09:39.858
Help. Help.

09:41.058 --> 09:44.757
- You think you can terrorize my lawn?
- No, I'm sorry.

09:44.957 --> 09:47.157
- You wanna be a dead person?
- No. I love life.

09:47.357 --> 09:50.357
This place is not
a playground for children.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.457
- Got it from now on.
- This is my house!

09:53.657 --> 09:55.357
Why can't you respect that?

09:55.557 --> 09:59.257
Why can't you
just stay away from-?

11:20.151 --> 11:21.851
Push.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.250
No siren. Never a good sign.

12:03.350 --> 12:04.750
I'm a murderer.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.550
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?

12:07.750 --> 12:10.750
When it's an accident,
they call it manslaughter.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.450
I think I'm gonna throw up.

12:16.549 --> 12:18.349
Great. Babysitter's here.

12:18.549 --> 12:20.848
See you, DJ.

12:21.348 --> 12:23.148
Perfect.

12:27.148 --> 12:28.348
DJ.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.548
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?

12:35.448 --> 12:36.948
Hello?

12:38.448 --> 12:39.648
Elizabeth...

12:40.548 --> 12:42.048
...can I talk to you
about something?

12:42.348 --> 12:45.248
Oh, yeah, of course you can,
cantaloupe.

12:45.448 --> 12:48.248
We are gonna have
the bestest time.

12:48.448 --> 12:51.747
- Got tons of neat activities planned.
- They already left.

12:51.947 --> 12:54.647
- They did? They're gone?
- Yes, and I need to talk to you.

12:54.847 --> 12:57.647
So the usual deal: indoors by 9,
in your room by 11.

12:57.847 --> 12:59.547
- Lights out, your call.
- Elizabeth.

12:59.747 --> 13:01.947
- And it's Zee.
- "Zee"?

13:02.147 --> 13:05.847
Now, listen up. I control the TV,
the stereo and the phone.

13:06.047 --> 13:09.247
I don't do board games,
Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.

13:09.547 --> 13:11.647
I'm not your mother.
I'm not your friend.

13:11.947 --> 13:16.047
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?
I am practically a grownup.

13:16.247 --> 13:18.847
I don't even need you here,
Elizabeth.

13:27.745 --> 13:31.245
- Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?
- But I didn't.

13:31.445 --> 13:34.145
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?

13:34.345 --> 13:36.345
- Go to your room.
- Fine.

15:27.039 --> 15:28.738
Hello?

15:30.438 --> 15:31.838
Hello?

15:35.938 --> 15:37.538
Hello?

15:37.738 --> 15:40.338
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.

16:17.836 --> 16:20.535
Happy Halloween, doofus.

16:21.535 --> 16:23.035
Nice one, Bones.

16:23.235 --> 16:25.635
Look at his face. That's funny.

16:26.635 --> 16:29.835
You're not supposed
to have friends over. Who's this?

16:30.035 --> 16:31.434
- This is Bones.
- What's up?

16:31.634 --> 16:33.234
- He's in a band.
- That's right.

16:33.434 --> 16:37.534
And, anyway, cantaloupe,
let's not open up the rulebook, okay?

16:37.734 --> 16:40.134
Since you're up
way past your bedtime.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.234
No, no, no, this is different. Listen.

16:51.434 --> 16:54.634
You called the neighbors.
Good for you.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.534
I used star-69. He called me.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.434
- Who called you?
- Nebbercracker.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.034
P.S., he died today.

17:01.234 --> 17:02.533
- You lie.
- Do not.

17:02.733 --> 17:05.433
He died, and now I'm getting
phone calls from his house.

17:07.032 --> 17:10.133
A phone call
from beyond the grave.

17:14.633 --> 17:18.032
Guys, come on. I'm serious.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.233
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?

17:20.433 --> 17:24.532
- Come on, man, give her back.
- Oh, "her"? You mind?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.633
Oh, come on. Gross.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.533
- Come on, Bones.
- Wait, hold on, dude. I th-

17:29.733 --> 17:32.933
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.

17:33.133 --> 17:34.432
All right, I'll look into it.

17:34.632 --> 17:36.832
- No. Elizabeth. No.
- Okay, Bones, knock it off.

17:37.132 --> 17:39.932
Downstairs, now.

17:40.332 --> 17:43.531
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.731
You are so funny.

17:47.931 --> 17:50.831
I know. It's like I don't even try
and it just happens.

18:14.529 --> 18:16.929
God, stop doing this.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.929
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do?

18:23.729 --> 18:26.829
- Homicide.
- Chowder, where are your parents?

18:27.029 --> 18:28.328
My dad's at the pharmacy...

18:28.528 --> 18:31.028
...and my mom's at the movies
with her personal trainer.

18:31.228 --> 18:34.628
- Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
- Fine.

18:35.628 --> 18:40.827
- Bones, I said, knock it off.
- Come on, man.

18:41.027 --> 18:43.227
No, I'm creeped out.

18:44.527 --> 18:47.027
You know,
I saw an ambulance here today.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.227
So?

18:48.427 --> 18:52.327
So maybe Nebbercracker
really did die.

18:52.527 --> 18:55.727
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.

18:55.927 --> 18:58.327
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.

18:58.527 --> 19:01.427
Oh, really, Zee?

19:01.827 --> 19:07.426
When I was 10 years old,
I had a kite. Awesome kite.

19:07.626 --> 19:11.125
I could fly it so high
you couldn't see it.

19:11.325 --> 19:14.825
One day, it crashed down.

19:15.125 --> 19:20.025
I followed the string
and it ended right over there...

19:20.225 --> 19:22.725
...across the street,
right at the edge of his lawn.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.925
Did he take your kite?

19:32.125 --> 19:35.425
Yeah, he takes whatever lands
on his lawn.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.525
But that's not the point.

19:37.725 --> 19:42.324
The point is, is that I saw him
talking to his house...

19:42.524 --> 19:45.724
...and kissing it.

19:47.124 --> 19:48.324
Besides...

19:48.824 --> 19:50.824
...everybody knows
what he did to his wife.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.424
Why? What-?
What did he do to her?

19:53.824 --> 19:58.324
- He ate her.
- Bones. Get off. Stop it!

19:59.424 --> 20:01.824
- Bones, enough.
- Come on, Zee.

20:02.024 --> 20:03.824
Bones, I'm so sick of you.

20:04.024 --> 20:06.524
- I was just-
- You have no respect for women.

20:06.724 --> 20:08.324
What? What does that mean?

20:08.524 --> 20:09.824
Get out.

20:10.924 --> 20:12.123
Fine.

20:16.923 --> 20:18.323
Prude.

20:25.822 --> 20:28.022
What are you looking at?

20:29.422 --> 20:32.022
Nebbercracker.

20:51.821 --> 20:54.021
You really are dead, aren't you?

20:59.920 --> 21:02.720
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.820
What are you gonna
do about it, Nebbercracker?

21:08.120 --> 21:12.020
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper-

21:24.119 --> 21:26.119
My awesome kite.

22:28.115 --> 22:29.115
Chowder.

22:31.015 --> 22:32.115
Chowder.

22:37.715 --> 22:39.215
Chowder?

22:40.315 --> 22:41.915
Chowder.

22:53.214 --> 22:54.414
Heat seeker.

22:54.614 --> 22:56.514
Chowder, what are you doing?

22:58.014 --> 22:59.014
Shut up.

22:59.314 --> 23:00.314
What?

23:00.814 --> 23:02.914
Nebbercracker's back
from the dead.

23:03.114 --> 23:05.914
- No way.
- Yeah.

23:06.114 --> 23:09.713
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?

23:09.913 --> 23:12.613
Chowder,
you're not listening to me.

23:12.813 --> 23:15.913
Nebbercracker's haunting me,
all right? His blood is on my hands.

23:16.313 --> 23:18.813
And now he's
coming back for revenge.

23:19.013 --> 23:21.812
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?

23:22.412 --> 23:25.812
I think you're just freaking out
because you killed a guy today.

23:26.012 --> 23:27.912
Life goes on.

23:28.412 --> 23:30.411
For you.

23:30.611 --> 23:34.311
Try and relax. Be cool, like me.

23:35.511 --> 23:37.411
Chowder, what are you doing?

23:37.611 --> 23:38.911
Make it stop.

23:39.811 --> 23:42.411
Quit screwing around.

23:42.811 --> 23:44.611
I need your help.

23:44.811 --> 23:46.011
Fine.

23:46.511 --> 23:47.811
You want my help?

23:48.011 --> 23:50.511
- Yeah.
- I got three words for you:

23:50.811 --> 23:54.410
"Trick or treat."

23:56.610 --> 23:59.810
Okay. Whatever. Let's go.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.510
Hold on.

24:09.810 --> 24:11.410
Chowder, come on.

24:18.810 --> 24:20.710
The haunting is subtle...

24:21.310 --> 24:22.710
...yet really, really boring.

24:22.910 --> 24:24.909
- Can I go home now?
- Chowder, he'll hear you.

24:25.109 --> 24:26.509
DJ...

24:27.609 --> 24:31.208
...this is why nobody
will sit next to us at lunch.

24:31.408 --> 24:35.308
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house
and you'll see. No ghost.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.108
Chowder, stop, please.

24:37.308 --> 24:38.408
Chowder, I'm serious.

24:38.908 --> 24:41.308
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.

24:41.508 --> 24:43.008
Come on.

24:50.308 --> 24:52.608
Chowder. Come back.

24:58.107 --> 25:01.906
- Oh, no. A bottle.
- Chowder, put that down.

25:02.106 --> 25:04.606
- Come back, please.
- Bottle.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.806
Hey, DJ, who am I?

25:26.206 --> 25:28.405
Get off my lawn.

25:28.805 --> 25:30.205
Don't. Come on.

26:06.202 --> 26:08.502
Run. Chowder, get out of there.

26:08.702 --> 26:10.202
- Chowder, come here.
- Mommy.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.502
This way. This way.

26:11.702 --> 26:12.802
Help.

26:13.002 --> 26:15.302
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!

26:24.102 --> 26:25.802
Don't look back.

26:28.202 --> 26:30.101
I looked back.

26:44.401 --> 26:46.101
Bones?

26:46.301 --> 26:47.801
Coming.

26:48.901 --> 26:52.501
Don't even think
about crawling back here...

26:54.501 --> 26:56.501
Trick or treat.

27:03.900 --> 27:04.900
What?

27:06.400 --> 27:07.400
Good morning, ma'am.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.300
You witnessed a simulation
of what you'll face this evening.

27:10.500 --> 27:13.199
Studies show that households
that run out of candy...

27:13.399 --> 27:16.399
...are 55 percent more likely
to be TP'd.

27:16.599 --> 27:18.199
To help avert this tragedy...

27:18.399 --> 27:21.699
...I'm here selling Halloween candy
for my school, Westbrook Prep.

27:21.899 --> 27:25.199
Good school.
I got kicked out of there.

27:25.399 --> 27:27.599
Now, what do you want?

27:27.799 --> 27:31.799
Just trying to get a head start on life
and secure a successful future.

27:32.099 --> 27:34.598
You want a successful future?

27:34.898 --> 27:37.298
When a guy with tattoos
comes up to the drive-through...

27:37.498 --> 27:41.198
...give him his burger,
not your phone number.

27:41.598 --> 27:44.398
Thank you for the advice.
I'll be sure to make a note of it.

27:44.598 --> 27:49.598
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.

27:49.898 --> 27:53.998
Without candy, I'm afraid your house
is a bull's-eye with shingles.

27:54.198 --> 27:57.498
Nice try. It's not my house.

27:57.698 --> 27:58.798
Babysitter?

28:00.198 --> 28:01.598
Okay, let's cut the crap.

28:01.798 --> 28:06.097
Maybe the parents you work for
left you $40 in emergency money.

28:06.297 --> 28:08.297
Maybe they left me 30.

28:08.797 --> 28:13.197
Maybe you give me 20, I write
a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.

28:13.397 --> 28:14.397
Maybe.

28:14.597 --> 28:18.697
And I want two extra bags
of peanut clusters.

28:18.897 --> 28:22.797
One bag and I'll
toss in a licorice whip.

28:23.897 --> 28:24.897
You're good.

28:36.593 --> 28:39.193
Eight A.M. No detectable movement.

28:39.393 --> 28:41.093
No detectable movement.

28:42.093 --> 28:44.993
Hey, DJ, I brought you
some chocolate.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.593
Cover blown?

28:57.293 --> 28:58.993
No detectable movement.

28:59.193 --> 29:01.293
What are you two weirdoes up to?

29:01.493 --> 29:02.793
Oh, nothing.

29:02.993 --> 29:05.993
Just something in the house
across the street just tried to eat us.

29:06.193 --> 29:09.692
Yeah. We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.

29:09.892 --> 29:12.492
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.

29:12.692 --> 29:15.092
Oh, gross.

29:15.292 --> 29:17.392
Whatever disease you guys have...

29:17.592 --> 29:20.592
...I'm sure it's got letters
and that they make pills for it.

29:20.792 --> 29:24.492
Zee, it's true. There's something evil
going on across the street.

29:24.692 --> 29:26.992
That's excellent.
I'm really happy for you.

29:27.192 --> 29:32.492
Anyway, have you two astronomers
seen Bones?

29:32.692 --> 29:35.092
He left last night unexpectedly...

29:36.592 --> 29:38.691
...and he never came back.

29:38.891 --> 29:40.191
Never came back?

29:42.291 --> 29:44.791
- Bottle.
- Of course.

29:44.991 --> 29:48.191
Oh, okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.

29:48.391 --> 29:50.991
Listen, Zee, I don't know
how to tell you this-

29:51.291 --> 29:53.690
Your boyfriend has most likely
been eaten alive.

29:55.290 --> 29:57.690
Sherry Klausen.

29:57.990 --> 29:59.090
I gotta go.

29:59.290 --> 30:00.490
Breakfast.

30:00.690 --> 30:02.990
Happy Halloween, losers.

30:26.489 --> 30:28.089
Hello.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.289
What?

30:29.889 --> 30:30.889
What is it?

30:31.189 --> 30:32.389
Oh, nothing.

30:32.589 --> 30:34.089
Let me see.

30:53.788 --> 30:55.688
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.488
- No. No. Hey.
- Hey, wait. Hey.

30:58.788 --> 31:00.788
DJ, that's your phone.

31:00.988 --> 31:02.988
- No, stop.
- Girl. Hey.

31:03.287 --> 31:05.087
- Don't go in there.
- Hold it.

31:06.487 --> 31:07.587
Don't go any further.

31:07.987 --> 31:10.187
- Come here.
- Yes, over here.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.386
Are you guys mentally challenged?

31:14.586 --> 31:18.085
If you are,
I'm certified to teach you baseball.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.085
Detectable movement.

31:30.785 --> 31:33.385
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Come on.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.785
Guys.

31:38.785 --> 31:40.485
- Run, Chowder.
- I'm running.

31:42.085 --> 31:43.885
Help, please.

31:46.084 --> 31:47.684
- Got her.
- No, I got her.

31:49.684 --> 31:51.484
Hello?

31:57.084 --> 31:58.984
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

31:59.184 --> 32:03.683
There's an angry dad on the phone
looking for the one called Chowder.

32:06.183 --> 32:07.283
Hello?

32:07.483 --> 32:09.783
Losers, I'm talking to you.

32:13.883 --> 32:15.682
He's worried about you.

32:15.882 --> 32:17.682
He should be.

32:18.282 --> 32:21.782
- Start explaining.
- All right, the house, it tried to eat us.

32:21.982 --> 32:25.082
- Stop explaining, I've had enough.
- Wait, wait, where are you going?

32:25.282 --> 32:27.782
To see what's happening
with that stupid house of yours.

32:27.982 --> 32:30.582
- No, no, no. You can't.
- What is your problem?

32:32.182 --> 32:35.482
Puberty. Yeah, I'm having
lots and lots of puberty.

32:38.881 --> 32:40.981
- No more Mountain Dew.
- Right.

32:41.281 --> 32:42.281
I'm going to find Bones.

32:42.581 --> 32:45.181
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.

32:45.381 --> 32:48.480
And you tell him I said hey, okay?
Safe driving.

32:48.780 --> 32:50.480
See you.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.080
Oh, hi.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.080
You wanna tell me what's going on?

32:57.280 --> 32:59.480
Oh, yeah. I made
the whole puberty thing up.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.680
Hi, I'm JD. DJ.

33:05.980 --> 33:09.380
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you,
but I forgot.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.280
Okay, I'm sorry.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.380
Okay.

33:14.580 --> 33:16.480
Absolutely.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.980
Affirmative.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.579
- Okay, love you. Bye.
- Yeah.

33:19.779 --> 33:24.779
And this is
our little observation post...

33:25.479 --> 33:27.679
...such as it were.

33:28.279 --> 33:29.879
Yeah, posters are stupid.

33:30.079 --> 33:32.579
I was gonna tear them down
and put up some art.

33:32.779 --> 33:35.878
Well, Dad, why don't you
kiss my hairy butt?

33:36.078 --> 33:38.278
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?

33:38.778 --> 33:40.278
Well, hello there.

33:40.478 --> 33:41.678
This is Chowder.

33:41.878 --> 33:43.078
Charles, to the ladies.

33:43.378 --> 33:44.778
Jenny Bennett.

33:44.978 --> 33:47.078
Two-term class president
at Westbrook Prep.

33:47.378 --> 33:50.777
- That's a tough school to get into.
- Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.

33:51.277 --> 33:53.677
It's a girls' school.

33:55.777 --> 33:58.476
Which is why I didn't.

33:59.276 --> 34:02.276
You know, there's a...
There's a great taco stand near there.

34:02.476 --> 34:03.476
I hate Mexican food.

34:03.676 --> 34:05.076
- Me too.
- Me too.

34:10.775 --> 34:13.076
Fascinating, isn't it?

34:13.275 --> 34:15.775
Just sits there waiting...

34:16.976 --> 34:19.476
...mocking us with its...

34:20.976 --> 34:22.275
...houseness.

34:22.574 --> 34:24.574
- May I please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.

34:24.775 --> 34:25.875
Here. Who you calling?

34:26.074 --> 34:27.175
- My mother.
- Rude.

34:27.375 --> 34:28.875
She's probably
not gonna believe you.

34:29.074 --> 34:31.175
It's too much for the adult mind
to comprehend.

34:33.074 --> 34:37.675
Is this pee? Because if it is,
that's really gross.

34:38.275 --> 34:40.475
- It's-
- DJ?

34:40.675 --> 34:42.475
You pee in bottles?

34:42.675 --> 34:44.775
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.

34:44.975 --> 34:45.975
- It's yours.
- It's his.

34:46.175 --> 34:47.875
- May I speak with Allison?
- Unsanitary.

34:48.175 --> 34:50.074
- Her daughter. Thank you.
- It's his pee.

34:50.275 --> 34:51.275
Excuse me.

34:51.475 --> 34:56.174
I was selling chocolates in Mayville,
and, well, it's kind of confusing.

34:58.374 --> 35:01.474
So you hate Mexican food, huh?

35:01.674 --> 35:03.074
Yeah. You too, huh?

35:03.474 --> 35:06.574
Yeah, in fact, you might say
I started hating it first.

35:06.774 --> 35:09.474
Outside in front of the house?

35:09.874 --> 35:12.774
- Fine. Let's get technical.
- Okay.

35:12.974 --> 35:14.874
I started hating it
through the telescope.

35:15.074 --> 35:17.074
Can't call dibs on a girl
through a telescope.

35:17.274 --> 35:18.774
You can't call dibs on a girl.

35:18.973 --> 35:20.473
- Just did.
- Me too.

35:20.673 --> 35:21.973
She didn't believe me.

35:22.173 --> 35:24.772
Authority can be so:

35:31.172 --> 35:34.672
Okay. Normally I don't spend time
with guys like you.

35:35.072 --> 35:39.571
But a house just tried to eat me,
so you've got one hour.

35:44.671 --> 35:47.171
Oh, a puppy.

35:54.371 --> 35:56.170
Didn't see that coming.

35:56.770 --> 35:58.370
Okay...

35:59.070 --> 36:01.270
...I think it's time to call the police.

36:09.369 --> 36:11.969
Do you realize
what's gonna happen tonight?

36:12.169 --> 36:15.069
Hundreds of kids
walking right up to that house.

36:15.269 --> 36:18.169
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.
Guys, I think we're overreacting.

36:18.369 --> 36:19.369
Think about it.

36:19.569 --> 36:23.869
Only a total moron would walk
up to old man Nebbercracker's house.

36:29.568 --> 36:30.568
- Hey, my ball.
- Chowder.

36:30.768 --> 36:31.968
No.

36:39.068 --> 36:41.067
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

36:43.567 --> 36:45.167
Good news. The cops are here.

36:45.967 --> 36:47.667
All right, kids, this better be good.

36:47.867 --> 36:51.567
I was in the forest wrestling
with a bear claw when we got the call.

36:55.867 --> 36:57.467
I was eating a doughnut.

36:58.167 --> 37:01.266
All three of you,
step to the car now.

37:01.466 --> 37:03.066
- My ears.
- They're at the car.

37:03.266 --> 37:05.866
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.

37:06.166 --> 37:07.666
Officer, we have reason
to believe...

37:07.866 --> 37:10.066
...there's a dangerous creature
inside that house.

37:10.266 --> 37:12.166
- It may have killed a man.
- And a dog.

37:12.366 --> 37:14.966
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.666
- We've got a situation.
- What are you doing?

37:17.866 --> 37:19.766
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?

37:19.966 --> 37:22.066
There's a dangerous creature
inside that house.

37:22.266 --> 37:26.066
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.

37:26.366 --> 37:27.466
And this is no situation.

37:27.666 --> 37:30.665
It's just a couple Tater Tots
hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.

37:30.865 --> 37:32.965
I bet you the dead dog
would beg to differ.

37:33.165 --> 37:34.565
What was that?

37:34.765 --> 37:36.065
Nothing.

37:37.365 --> 37:38.665
All right. Time's up, peewees.

37:38.865 --> 37:42.165
- It's Halloween. We got things to do.
- We do?

37:42.365 --> 37:45.965
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth...

37:46.165 --> 37:49.465
...and it comes out and grabs things
and pulls them in and eats them.

37:49.665 --> 37:50.665
Yeah, like this:

37:50.865 --> 37:55.165
Okay, okay, okay. The thing is...

37:55.365 --> 37:59.065
...we're trying to make this sound
more real than it normally would.

37:59.465 --> 38:01.963
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.

38:02.163 --> 38:04.363
- So we'll see you later.
- No.

38:04.563 --> 38:08.663
All right. I'll show you.
But if things get out of hand...

38:08.863 --> 38:10.663
We'll aim for Bigfoot.

38:11.663 --> 38:12.863
That's loaded.

38:21.163 --> 38:22.663
He's hopping.

38:29.163 --> 38:30.663
Smart house.

38:32.863 --> 38:34.062
Hey.

38:34.262 --> 38:37.161
You- Both of you. Come here.

38:37.361 --> 38:38.561
Bring it to the car.

38:38.761 --> 38:39.961
Come on.

38:40.161 --> 38:43.661
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock
because that dance was pretty funny.

38:43.861 --> 38:46.261
But next time any of you
mess with this guy's house...

38:46.461 --> 38:48.861
...all three of you are going
in the hole, you got it?

38:49.061 --> 38:50.861
Now, I'll give you
10 seconds to march.

38:51.061 --> 38:52.361
But we need your help.

38:52.561 --> 38:54.561
It's your job to help us.

38:54.761 --> 38:56.261
- One.
- Come on.

38:56.461 --> 38:57.961
Two.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.361
Three.

38:59.561 --> 39:00.561
Four.

39:00.761 --> 39:02.261
Five.

39:02.961 --> 39:04.061
That's tender.

39:04.261 --> 39:06.360
My house is right over there.

39:08.159 --> 39:10.259
So much for relying
on the government.

39:10.459 --> 39:12.159
Yeah, I know.
I hate the government.

39:12.359 --> 39:14.759
- Dude, we're screwed.
- No, we're not.

39:15.059 --> 39:17.459
We'll go to an expert.

39:19.559 --> 39:22.159
You're looking
at the three-time, tri-state...

39:22.359 --> 39:25.758
...over-14
"Thou Art Dead" champion.

39:25.958 --> 39:29.358
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.

39:29.558 --> 39:31.558
- Who's "they"?
- Me and DJ.

39:31.758 --> 39:34.558
- Yeah.
- He's the smartest guy on earth.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.258
So let's go talk to him.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.057
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on. Hold up.

39:39.257 --> 39:41.157
Skull is in the game zone right now.

39:41.357 --> 39:43.857
You don't wanna mess with him
when he's in the game zone.

39:44.257 --> 39:47.157
Fine, so how long
is he gonna be playing?

39:47.357 --> 39:49.157
Die. Die.

39:50.257 --> 39:54.257
Who knows? He once played
for four days straight...

39:54.457 --> 39:58.557
...on one quarter, a gallon
of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.

39:58.757 --> 40:00.557
The man's a legend.

40:00.757 --> 40:03.857
Well, if he's not coming out of
the game zone, then we are going in.

40:04.057 --> 40:06.457
- What? Hey, what are you-?
- What? Jenny, no.

40:08.956 --> 40:11.556
It's like you're not gonna-
You're not gonna do it. Like-

40:11.756 --> 40:13.856
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

40:14.056 --> 40:15.156
Watch out.

40:15.356 --> 40:17.656
Did you see that?
I just chopped off your head again.

40:17.856 --> 40:20.756
Your head's rolling. You can't see it,
your eyes are on your head.

40:20.956 --> 40:22.756
- Sir?
- What?

40:22.956 --> 40:26.556
I'm busy playing a video game
without even looking at the screen.

40:26.856 --> 40:28.356
What?

40:28.556 --> 40:30.456
Old man Nebbercracker's house
is possessed.

40:30.656 --> 40:33.256
I need to know how to destroy it
before it kills people.

40:33.456 --> 40:37.456
Calm down. You make me wanna
throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.

40:37.656 --> 40:40.255
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
It's so cold.

40:44.255 --> 40:46.654
Possessed house, you say?

40:48.954 --> 40:52.754
In my travels to the video store
and comic-book conventions...

40:52.954 --> 40:55.754
...I've seen many strange
and wondrous things.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.554
And I've heard tell
of man-made structures...

40:58.754 --> 41:01.954
...becoming possessed
by a human soul...

41:02.154 --> 41:05.754
...so that the spirit becomes merged
with wood and brick...

41:05.954 --> 41:09.053
...creating a rare form of monster...

41:09.253 --> 41:14.052
...known as Domus mactabilis.

41:17.752 --> 41:20.352
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.

41:20.552 --> 41:22.152
We're its murderous enemies.

41:23.552 --> 41:25.452
Have fun getting killed.

41:25.652 --> 41:27.752
Run, coward.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.252
Look at that blood.

41:31.652 --> 41:34.152
So how do we kill it?

41:34.452 --> 41:37.852
You've gotta strike
at the source of life: the heart.

41:39.052 --> 41:40.352
But houses don't have hearts.

41:40.552 --> 41:42.152
Yes!

41:43.951 --> 41:45.251
Oh, yeah.

41:45.451 --> 41:48.151
Yeah. You might be right about that.

41:50.251 --> 41:54.051
Sorry, children, but I've got some very
important business to take care of.

41:55.451 --> 41:57.751
I won't be seeing you later.

42:06.050 --> 42:08.050
Thou art dead.

42:17.349 --> 42:18.949
So we need to strike at the heart.

42:19.149 --> 42:22.749
Yeah, but where are we gonna find
a heart inside a house?

42:25.449 --> 42:27.349
Ever since Nebbercracker died...

42:27.549 --> 42:30.149
...there's been smoke
coming out of that chimney.

42:34.749 --> 42:37.349
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.

42:38.548 --> 42:41.548
If we wanna put out the fire,
we're gonna have to go inside.

42:41.748 --> 42:44.148
Without getting chewed to pieces.

42:46.347 --> 42:48.247
- Dummy.
- Hey, I was just doodling.

42:48.447 --> 42:51.047
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.

42:51.247 --> 42:53.747
We fill the dummy
with a few gallons of cold medicine.

42:53.947 --> 42:56.547
- Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
- Say what?

42:56.747 --> 42:59.747
Feed the dummy to the house, house
eats the medicine, goes to sleep.

42:59.947 --> 43:02.847
- Look at this.
- We get in, douse the fire and get out.

43:06.847 --> 43:09.447
- Questions?
- Yes, are you nuts?

43:09.647 --> 43:11.547
I don't wanna steal drugs
from my father...

43:11.747 --> 43:14.347
...I don't wanna go inside a monster
and I don't wanna die.

43:14.547 --> 43:17.446
- I say it's worth a shot.
- Yes, I agree, let's do it.

43:47.744 --> 43:50.843
Hey, but I wanted that one.

43:51.043 --> 43:53.243
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Yes.

44:22.242 --> 44:25.542
- Chowder. Quiet.
- Sorry.

44:32.042 --> 44:33.442
Go.

44:42.442 --> 44:44.642
Whoopsie-daisy.

44:52.740 --> 44:57.040
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy,
I'm gonna move you into position.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.540
You don't be scared.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.640
That's not how I trained you.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.540
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.

45:05.940 --> 45:07.540
Chowder, come on.

45:15.740 --> 45:17.240
Okay.

45:26.439 --> 45:27.939
Yes.

45:30.139 --> 45:32.139
Trick or treat.

45:33.539 --> 45:34.739
Plug it in.

46:19.435 --> 46:21.335
So close.

46:25.834 --> 46:29.434
Littering, loitering,
vandalism, vagrancy-

46:29.634 --> 46:31.234
- And treason.
- No, not treason.

46:31.434 --> 46:33.334
- You sure? Because in the book-
- I'm sure.

46:33.534 --> 46:35.634
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.

46:35.834 --> 46:39.734
Come on. You heard the big guy.
You see the light. Walk towards it.

46:40.734 --> 46:41.734
Come on, keep it moving.

46:42.034 --> 46:44.734
All right, drop your weapons.

46:45.034 --> 46:47.334
Pass them to me. Come on.

46:49.234 --> 46:53.934
- I will shoot you.
- Well, lookie we got here.

46:57.233 --> 46:59.333
You stay here,
I'm checking this out.

47:00.133 --> 47:03.133
I am on it.

47:17.533 --> 47:21.033
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me? Huh, tough girl?

47:21.233 --> 47:22.533
You disrespecting the badge?

47:22.733 --> 47:26.033
You don't want none of this.
I'm telling you. Test me. Please.

47:26.233 --> 47:28.433
Y'all wanna test me?

47:28.633 --> 47:30.132
I am the police.

47:32.031 --> 47:34.531
I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes...

47:34.731 --> 47:35.831
I see it in your eyes.

47:36.031 --> 47:38.531
That's it. That is it.

47:38.731 --> 47:41.131
You got something to say,
Porky, huh?

47:41.331 --> 47:44.631
- That's it, we're taking them in.
- That's what I'm talking about.

47:44.831 --> 47:47.031
- Where we taking them?
- To jail. Let's go.

47:47.231 --> 47:50.531
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.

47:50.831 --> 47:52.731
But, officer,
you've gotta believe us.

47:53.031 --> 47:55.131
Yeah, 2-percent,
you got the right to shut up.

47:55.331 --> 47:58.731
- Okay, the house is a monster.
- And to think I believed you.

47:58.931 --> 48:02.630
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.

48:02.830 --> 48:05.530
I mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.

48:05.730 --> 48:08.630
Yeah. They're gonna love you
downtown, Jughead.

48:11.530 --> 48:13.230
We are supercops.

48:13.430 --> 48:15.630
Yeah. That's why I live in a condo.

48:15.830 --> 48:18.430
Supercop. Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super-

48:20.230 --> 48:22.830
- You hear that?
- That's my stomach. I'm starving.

48:23.030 --> 48:26.630
No, no. That sounds
like the dangerous creature.

48:26.930 --> 48:30.230
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Oh, my gosh.

48:30.430 --> 48:33.629
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, I'll be back.

48:33.829 --> 48:35.129
- You guys, stop.
- Hey, guys.

48:35.329 --> 48:37.929
- No. Get out of there.
- No, don't go in there.

48:49.128 --> 48:50.528
What?

48:52.927 --> 48:56.327
I tell you. Super-roll.

48:57.927 --> 49:00.527
- Stop. Stop.
- Hey. Hey. Come on.

49:00.727 --> 49:02.627
You don't know
what's up with that house.

49:06.826 --> 49:09.626
Where you at, spooky creature?

49:09.826 --> 49:11.626
I'm gonna find you.

49:16.626 --> 49:17.626
Freeze...

49:17.826 --> 49:19.426
...tree.

49:21.626 --> 49:24.126
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.

49:24.326 --> 49:27.926
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.

49:30.026 --> 49:32.926
- I'm coming, buddy.
- Put me down!

49:33.126 --> 49:36.625
- I'm gonna go get backup.
- I thought there was no backup.

49:36.825 --> 49:38.325
I'm getting Judy.

49:40.625 --> 49:43.324
Judy!

49:43.924 --> 49:46.024
Help!

49:46.224 --> 49:47.624
Mama!

49:51.824 --> 49:54.424
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

49:54.624 --> 49:57.824
- I think I'm having a stroke.
- Just try to stay calm, okay?

49:58.024 --> 50:00.824
We'll be all right
if we just stay calm.

50:13.723 --> 50:15.822
I'm too young to die!

50:24.922 --> 50:27.822
Jenny. I've always loved you.

50:28.922 --> 50:30.822
- Chowder!
- Sorry.

50:31.222 --> 50:33.122
Mama!

50:33.622 --> 50:35.622
I can't look.

50:41.921 --> 50:44.321
Guys, come on. Let's go.

51:26.119 --> 51:30.019
We're dead. You've killed us
and now we're dead.

51:30.219 --> 51:33.119
I don't think the house knows
that we're in here.

51:33.319 --> 51:35.818
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.

51:36.018 --> 51:37.518
Listen.

51:37.718 --> 51:40.018
It sounds like it's sleeping.

51:40.318 --> 51:42.917
The only way that we're gonna
get out of here alive...

51:43.117 --> 51:45.617
...is if we find the heart,
we put out the fire.

51:45.917 --> 51:48.217
Maybe we should examine
our other options.

51:48.417 --> 51:50.417
Sure. Other option:

51:50.617 --> 51:53.917
We wait here and do nothing
until it wakes up and eats us.

51:54.917 --> 51:58.017
Find the heart,
put out the fire. Got it.

52:09.617 --> 52:12.716
Explosives. That's so cool.

52:30.616 --> 52:33.116
- He was watching me.
- DJ.

52:35.016 --> 52:36.516
Did you ever see a wife?

52:37.516 --> 52:40.016
People used to say he had one...

52:41.116 --> 52:43.516
...but he fattened her up...

52:44.115 --> 52:46.015
...and he ate her.

52:52.915 --> 52:55.715
"Demolition squad."

52:59.914 --> 53:01.714
Sorry.

53:02.114 --> 53:03.614
Come on.

53:07.114 --> 53:08.314
Be quiet.

53:08.514 --> 53:11.214
Don't worry, I have a very light step.

53:19.712 --> 53:21.112
There. Right there. Shoot it.

54:02.010 --> 54:03.910
What? I thought
if I shot the heart, that-

54:04.110 --> 54:06.310
- That's not the heart.
- Then what is it?

54:06.510 --> 54:10.610
Well, if those are the teeth
and that's the tongue...

54:10.810 --> 54:13.110
...then that must be the uvula.

54:16.310 --> 54:18.408
So it's a girl house.

54:18.608 --> 54:20.508
What? No.

54:20.708 --> 54:24.308
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.

54:24.508 --> 54:25.708
Not me.

54:42.708 --> 54:44.208
No.

54:48.508 --> 54:51.207
Okay. Let's move.

54:56.507 --> 54:59.007
We need to move quickly
and quietly.

54:59.207 --> 55:00.607
Don't touch anything.

55:00.807 --> 55:03.207
And stay together-

55:03.407 --> 55:05.307
- DJ!
- Wait.

55:05.507 --> 55:07.007
DJ.

55:12.307 --> 55:14.407
I'll save you.

55:28.206 --> 55:30.006
Chowder, knock it off.

55:30.206 --> 55:33.306
Sorry. I thought you were- DJ!

55:33.506 --> 55:35.906
- Chowder, it's a toy.
- Oh, yeah.

55:36.106 --> 55:38.106
Where's DJ?

55:38.306 --> 55:41.105
- DJ.
- Over here.

55:44.605 --> 55:47.105
Look at all these toys.

55:48.805 --> 55:52.105
This must be where
Nebbercracker kept his stash.

55:52.904 --> 55:54.704
"Stash."

55:56.004 --> 55:58.304
I think you guys
should have a look at this.

56:17.403 --> 56:20.103
- The key.
- Come on, we don't have time for this.

56:20.303 --> 56:22.103
Yeah, we've gotta
find a way out of here.

56:29.602 --> 56:31.602
What are you doing?

56:40.802 --> 56:44.002
We have a Ping-Pong table
in our basement.

56:50.001 --> 56:51.201
Constance.

56:51.401 --> 56:54.901
Holy moly. He really did eat her.

56:55.101 --> 56:56.800
Couldn't have.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.900
Her whole body is buried in cement.

57:08.499 --> 57:10.599
Look at all this stuff.

57:11.799 --> 57:15.599
Why would he build her a shrine
if he murdered her?

57:15.899 --> 57:20.399
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?

57:23.799 --> 57:27.698
I always knew you were hiding
something, Mr. Nebbercracker.

57:31.298 --> 57:32.998
DJ.

57:35.698 --> 57:37.998
Way to go, big nose.

57:48.998 --> 57:51.698
- It's awake.
- Run!

57:59.097 --> 58:00.297
Hide.

58:19.997 --> 58:23.196
Hey, I know that sound.

58:26.796 --> 58:28.696
My ball.

58:28.896 --> 58:31.795
Where are you going? Come here.

58:31.995 --> 58:35.695
- Chowder, come back.
- You get back here.

58:38.295 --> 58:39.495
Gotcha.

58:42.795 --> 58:44.995
Killer Slinkys!

58:46.594 --> 58:49.794
- Chowder.
- Leave me alone!

58:58.594 --> 59:01.993
DJ! Help!

59:04.993 --> 59:06.393
Oh, no.

59:13.793 --> 59:14.793
Get off.

59:27.693 --> 59:29.193
Jenny.

59:29.793 --> 59:30.793
Chowder.

59:34.792 --> 59:37.092
Come on, Chowder, grab on.

59:38.392 --> 59:39.892
Gotcha.

59:41.792 --> 59:43.292
DJ, look out!

59:48.091 --> 59:49.591
No!

59:50.291 --> 59:52.391
The uvula.

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:11.790
- DJ-
- Chowder.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.990
Mommy!

01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:29.989
Gross.

01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:32.289
Did we just get upchucked?

01:00:32.489 --> 01:00:35.689
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.

01:00:39.388 --> 01:00:43.388
That's it. Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.

01:00:43.588 --> 01:00:44.988
What do you want from me,
Chowder?

01:00:45.188 --> 01:00:47.588
I don't see you coming up
with any big ideas.

01:00:47.788 --> 01:00:50.288
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?

01:00:50.488 --> 01:00:54.288
I'm going home to make
a pretzel sandwich. See you.

01:00:54.688 --> 01:00:57.488
Chowder, the house is still alive
and you're gonna wuss out?

01:00:57.688 --> 01:01:00.488
I risked my life for you.
I stole drugs for you...

01:01:00.688 --> 01:01:02.888
...and I could've died in there.
- Yeah, me too.

01:01:03.088 --> 01:01:05.687
You're the one that killed
Nebbercracker in the first place.

01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:07.486
- Getting your ball back.
- You guys.

01:01:07.686 --> 01:01:10.286
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.

01:01:10.486 --> 01:01:12.486
We are babies.

01:01:12.686 --> 01:01:14.086
What were we thinking?

01:01:14.286 --> 01:01:17.185
We tried to put a house to sleep
with cold medicine.

01:01:17.385 --> 01:01:20.385
- How lame can you get?
- Where are you going?

01:01:20.585 --> 01:01:23.385
I'm going home. I suck.

01:01:26.185 --> 01:01:27.985
DJ.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.485
At least it's an ambulance.

01:01:34.585 --> 01:01:36.285
DJ?

01:01:54.984 --> 01:01:56.984
It's a ghost.

01:01:58.184 --> 01:02:00.184
Begone. Fie.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:04.084
Begone yourself. Get away.

01:02:05.284 --> 01:02:06.984
He's not a ghost.

01:02:07.184 --> 01:02:09.984
He's not dead. I'm not a murderer.

01:02:10.383 --> 01:02:13.883
Of course I'm not dead.
Who said I was dead?

01:02:14.783 --> 01:02:16.683
You'll be dead if you don't scram.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.783
- Come on, DJ.
- Let's hurry.

01:02:18.983 --> 01:02:22.383
Don't you know what day this is?

01:02:24.883 --> 01:02:28.082
I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:33.782
Honey...

01:02:35.082 --> 01:02:36.682
...I'm home.

01:02:40.982 --> 01:02:42.581
Oh, look at you, dear.

01:02:43.781 --> 01:02:46.081
Your shingles are all ruffled...

01:02:46.981 --> 01:02:49.481
...and your windows are cracked.

01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:55.981
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.

01:02:56.181 --> 01:02:59.281
It's her. The house is her.

01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:01.181
- DJ, what are you doing?
- Wait. Come on.

01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:02.781
- Come back.
- Where you going?

01:03:02.981 --> 01:03:04.681
Nothing paint and varnish
can't handle.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:07.181
Mr. Nebbercracker.

01:03:08.781 --> 01:03:10.081
I know about Constance.

01:03:10.281 --> 01:03:11.881
You what?

01:03:12.381 --> 01:03:14.780
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.580
You were in my house? You-

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.880
You didn't kill her, did you?

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.180
I love her so much.

01:04:04.476 --> 01:04:05.976
Hello?

01:04:08.376 --> 01:04:10.176
It's okay.

01:04:11.376 --> 01:04:13.676
I can take you away from here.

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:15.676
Would you like that?

01:04:19.275 --> 01:04:20.775
Yes.

01:04:22.575 --> 01:04:24.475
There we go.

01:04:24.675 --> 01:04:26.475
Won't be long now.

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:35.475
All right.

01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:39.575
Okay, open your eyes.

01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:44.575
- Now, it's not much, I know, but just-
- Darling.

01:04:50.574 --> 01:04:52.874
Get away from my house!

01:04:53.074 --> 01:04:56.174
I'm gonna rip them to bits.

01:04:57.474 --> 01:04:59.074
Help.

01:04:59.274 --> 01:05:00.774
- Constance.
- Help. Help.

01:05:00.974 --> 01:05:03.174
- What's wrong? Are you hurt?
- Hurt?

01:05:03.374 --> 01:05:06.374
Yes, I'm hurt. Those criminals
are attacking our house.

01:05:06.574 --> 01:05:07.774
- Trick or treat.
- Now, now...

01:05:08.174 --> 01:05:10.973
...they're just kids, dear.

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.373
- It's Halloween.
- No, no, no.

01:05:12.573 --> 01:05:14.973
It's my house,
and they're hurting me.

01:05:15.173 --> 01:05:18.373
Constance, look at me. Look at me.

01:05:18.573 --> 01:05:23.272
As long as I'm here,
I will never let anyone hurt you.

01:05:23.472 --> 01:05:24.672
- Constance.
- Sucker.

01:05:24.872 --> 01:05:26.572
You vandals.

01:05:26.772 --> 01:05:28.272
- Eat this.
- You hooligans.

01:05:28.472 --> 01:05:30.872
- I'll get you.
- Constance, no!

01:05:45.072 --> 01:05:48.372
So I finished the house.

01:05:48.572 --> 01:05:51.371
She would've wanted that.

01:05:52.071 --> 01:05:56.071
She died, but she didn't leave.

01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:02.071
And that night...

01:06:02.271 --> 01:06:06.871
...that one night of every year...

01:06:07.071 --> 01:06:09.271
...I had to take precautions.

01:06:09.471 --> 01:06:11.271
- Trick or treat.
- I had to.

01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:14.971
- Sucker.
- I had to.

01:06:17.871 --> 01:06:20.570
Hey! Get a-

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.369
Stay away from my house!

01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:28.269
She attacks anyone
who comes near.

01:06:28.469 --> 01:06:29.669
Go.

01:06:29.869 --> 01:06:32.468
I'm coming, dear.

01:06:32.668 --> 01:06:34.168
Go.

01:06:34.868 --> 01:06:37.568
No, no, no, wait. I can't let you
do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.

01:06:37.768 --> 01:06:40.268
I know that you've been
protecting us all these years.

01:06:40.468 --> 01:06:42.568
But now it's our turn to protect you.

01:06:42.768 --> 01:06:44.768
Let her go.

01:06:49.368 --> 01:06:51.168
But if I let her go...

01:06:51.868 --> 01:06:53.268
...then I'll have no one.

01:06:54.167 --> 01:06:55.767
That's not true.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.567
Constance, no!

01:07:19.966 --> 01:07:21.266
Come on.

01:07:21.966 --> 01:07:25.465
The house is alive!

01:07:33.165 --> 01:07:35.465
This way. This way. Come on.

01:07:36.165 --> 01:07:37.965
You guys, come on.

01:07:43.265 --> 01:07:45.565
- What are you doing?
- Trying to slow the house down.

01:07:45.765 --> 01:07:47.965
Move it, pork chop.

01:07:51.465 --> 01:07:53.064
Come on, come on.

01:08:07.963 --> 01:08:10.363
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.

01:08:12.263 --> 01:08:14.463
I can't.

01:08:17.063 --> 01:08:19.063
Mr. Nebbercracker. Hurry.

01:08:19.363 --> 01:08:21.263
Go on. I'll be all right.

01:08:22.263 --> 01:08:23.863
Oh, man.

01:08:36.761 --> 01:08:39.362
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.960
You stay away
from those children, Constance!

01:09:32.858 --> 01:09:34.058
Constance.

01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:37.058
Mr. Nebbercracker.

01:09:39.358 --> 01:09:40.957
Oh, now...

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:45.058
There, there, girl.

01:09:47.158 --> 01:09:49.158
My sweet.

01:09:50.258 --> 01:09:52.758
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?

01:09:53.658 --> 01:09:55.858
You've hurt people.

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:58.458
Oh, Constance.

01:09:59.158 --> 01:10:03.957
Oh, we've always known
this day would come. Haven't we?

01:10:09.657 --> 01:10:12.557
I have to make things right.

01:10:15.657 --> 01:10:18.757
I have to make things right.

01:10:21.657 --> 01:10:23.457
Constance.

01:10:26.857 --> 01:10:30.357
I've always done
what's best for you, haven't I?

01:10:31.957 --> 01:10:33.157
Haven't I, girl?

01:10:36.355 --> 01:10:37.855
Come on, let's move.

01:10:38.955 --> 01:10:41.055
Oh, Constance.

01:10:44.455 --> 01:10:47.855
Let this be the right thing to do.

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:55.754
Leave him alone!

01:10:55.954 --> 01:10:59.254
Yeah, get your grubby branches
off the old man!

01:11:01.154 --> 01:11:02.854
Take that!

01:11:04.054 --> 01:11:06.053
And that!

01:11:08.253 --> 01:11:10.453
Mr. Nebbercracker.

01:11:12.553 --> 01:11:14.453
Oh, kid, come here.

01:11:16.053 --> 01:11:17.953
- Take this.
- What?

01:11:18.653 --> 01:11:20.553
You have to help me. Please.

01:11:20.753 --> 01:11:22.952
I know you can do it.

01:11:25.152 --> 01:11:28.352
Go on. Go. Hurry.

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:31.852
How do you know
how to drive this thing?

01:11:32.052 --> 01:11:33.652
I don't.

01:11:37.451 --> 01:11:40.151
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.

01:11:46.451 --> 01:11:47.851
Jenny!

01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:02.450
Jenny. Are you all right?

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:04.750
I'm not sure.

01:12:08.749 --> 01:12:11.349
DJ, get rid of that thing.

01:12:11.549 --> 01:12:13.549
I'm working on it.

01:12:13.749 --> 01:12:16.649
Chowder, I need you to get the house
down under that crane.

01:12:17.049 --> 01:12:18.449
Think you could do that?

01:12:18.749 --> 01:12:20.649
Piece of cake.

01:12:21.949 --> 01:12:23.449
Come on.

01:12:29.449 --> 01:12:32.549
You think you can just
mess with my friends?

01:12:39.049 --> 01:12:40.848
DJ, look.

01:12:55.948 --> 01:12:57.748
Mommy.

01:13:03.748 --> 01:13:05.148
Chowder.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:07.448
Come in, Chowder.

01:13:07.648 --> 01:13:09.748
Chowder, buddy?

01:13:18.446 --> 01:13:19.746
Hey, guys.

01:13:19.946 --> 01:13:23.546
Look who just won.
It's me, the screw-up.

01:13:23.746 --> 01:13:26.446
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!

01:13:27.146 --> 01:13:30.446
Look at me. Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.

01:13:30.946 --> 01:13:33.246
- Sorry.
- Guys, come on.

01:13:34.346 --> 01:13:36.746
Yes. Look at me.

01:13:41.446 --> 01:13:43.045
You can't do that.

01:13:43.245 --> 01:13:45.645
That's not fair.

01:14:04.344 --> 01:14:07.044
No. Get on the top. Help!

01:14:10.744 --> 01:14:13.244
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.

01:14:18.243 --> 01:14:21.843
You ain't nothing. You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.

01:14:28.242 --> 01:14:29.842
No!

01:15:17.739 --> 01:15:20.939
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:15:23.439 --> 01:15:24.639
Go.

01:15:24.839 --> 01:15:26.439
I kissed a girl.

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:28.739
I kissed a girl on the lips.

01:15:31.739 --> 01:15:35.639
Guys. Any time now.

01:15:40.839 --> 01:15:42.439
Sorry.

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:46.839
DJ, hurry.

01:15:54.138 --> 01:15:55.738
I'm flying!

01:15:56.638 --> 01:16:00.238
- On three, light the dynamite.
- Okay, I got it.

01:16:04.537 --> 01:16:06.337
- One.
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:16:06.537 --> 01:16:08.937
- Two.
- Yes.

01:16:09.237 --> 01:16:10.837
Thr-

01:16:11.737 --> 01:16:14.137
DJ!

01:16:20.237 --> 01:16:22.136
Three!

01:17:20.734 --> 01:17:22.633
Do you guys hear something?

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:27.532
It's over there. Come on.

01:17:29.832 --> 01:17:32.032
Oh, my dear.

01:17:44.532 --> 01:17:46.432
Goodbye.

01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:09.530
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker,
about your house...

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:13.330
...and your wife.

01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:17.330
Your house-wife.

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:24.730
Forty-five years.

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:31.429
We have been trapped
for 45 years.

01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:33.329
And now...

01:18:36.329 --> 01:18:38.329
...we're free.

01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:43.528
We're free.

01:18:43.828 --> 01:18:46.228
Thank you, friend.

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:50.628
Thank you all.

01:18:51.028 --> 01:18:53.128
We're free.

01:19:06.426 --> 01:19:07.626
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:09.826
Happy Halloween.

01:19:11.326 --> 01:19:13.526
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

01:19:14.026 --> 01:19:15.026
Here you go.

01:19:15.326 --> 01:19:16.526
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:19:17.026 --> 01:19:18.726
Happy Halloween.

01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:20.526
Next.

01:19:22.726 --> 01:19:24.726
What happened
to Nebbercracker's house?

01:19:26.626 --> 01:19:29.425
It turned into a monster,
so I blew it up.

01:19:31.325 --> 01:19:32.925
Trick or treat.

01:19:33.225 --> 01:19:34.525
We're gonna need a tricycle.

01:19:35.525 --> 01:19:38.025
One tricycle, coming up.

01:19:38.825 --> 01:19:40.825
Tricycle.

01:19:41.025 --> 01:19:42.925
Tricycle.

01:19:43.325 --> 01:19:45.525
- Tricycle.
- Hello, tricycle.

01:19:45.725 --> 01:19:47.525
I missed you so much.

01:19:47.725 --> 01:19:49.725
- Thank you, mister.
- Goodbye, now.

01:19:49.925 --> 01:19:52.425
- Happy Halloween.
- Come on.

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:55.725
- Mom. There's my mom.
- Jenny!

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:57.325
- One second.
- Okay.

01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:00.625
So...

01:20:00.824 --> 01:20:02.824
We should hang out again.

01:20:03.224 --> 01:20:04.324
Soon.

01:20:06.023 --> 01:20:08.123
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:20:08.323 --> 01:20:09.823
See you.

01:20:14.423 --> 01:20:16.823
Good luck with the puberty.

01:20:17.823 --> 01:20:20.323
She grabbed my butt.

01:20:20.523 --> 01:20:22.223
That's nice, Chowder.

01:20:22.423 --> 01:20:24.823
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
It's time to go.

01:20:25.023 --> 01:20:29.023
Oh, you go on.
I've got some work to do.

01:20:30.023 --> 01:20:32.223
All right. Thanks.

01:20:32.422 --> 01:20:34.222
- I'll see you around.
- All right. Bye.

01:20:34.422 --> 01:20:35.622
Hey.

01:20:36.122 --> 01:20:38.322
Stay off my lawn.

01:20:39.322 --> 01:20:41.222
I'm just kidding.

01:20:41.422 --> 01:20:44.322
- You think he'll be okay?
- Yeah. He'll be fine.

01:20:44.522 --> 01:20:47.922
He'll go on vacation, get some color,
maybe he'll meet someone new.

01:20:48.122 --> 01:20:50.322
This time, maybe
a nice beach house.

01:20:52.122 --> 01:20:53.322
Hey, DJ, look who's here.

01:20:53.522 --> 01:20:55.722
- Yes, I can see that, thank you.
- No biggie.

01:20:55.922 --> 01:20:57.722
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:03.821
What the heck kind-?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

01:21:04.521 --> 01:21:06.221
It's...

01:21:08.121 --> 01:21:11.821
- Dirty pirates?
- That's it. Dirty pirates.

01:21:13.321 --> 01:21:15.821
Fun, fun. Oh, you look adorable.

01:21:16.521 --> 01:21:18.721
Have fun tonight.

01:21:33.218 --> 01:21:37.017
You know, you were right.

01:21:37.517 --> 01:21:40.117
We're definitely too old
for trick-or-treating.

01:21:40.317 --> 01:21:44.017
Oh, yeah. No question about it.

01:21:47.017 --> 01:21:48.717
On the other hand...

01:21:50.017 --> 01:21:52.017
...we've been working all night.

01:22:00.817 --> 01:22:02.217
Candy time?

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:04.017
Candy time.

01:22:04.217 --> 01:22:06.417
We're back. Yes.

01:22:06.617 --> 01:22:08.616
Candy.

01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:49.212
- Did we just get-?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:50.512 --> 01:23:52.712
It's Halloween, right?

01:23:52.912 --> 01:23:57.511
What do you say you and I go out...

01:23:57.711 --> 01:24:01.411
...and "inspect" some candy, huh?

01:24:03.511 --> 01:24:06.611
We should go eat some candy too.

01:24:07.011 --> 01:24:08.211
That's a good idea.

01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:12.909
Okay. All right.
Let's go eat some candy.

01:24:13.109 --> 01:24:15.809
Lots of yummy candy.

01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:18.009
Like carrots.

01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:21.009
All right, where's the car?

01:24:21.209 --> 01:24:24.109
And that is how I slayed
that mystical dragon.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.409
Oh, yeah? That's great.

01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:29.109
Come on, baby. We're out of here.

01:24:30.609 --> 01:24:33.009
Not so fast, Bones.

01:24:33.309 --> 01:24:35.409
Times have changed.

01:24:35.609 --> 01:24:37.409
Skull's not like you.

01:24:37.609 --> 01:24:39.809
He gives me the respect I deserve...

01:24:40.009 --> 01:24:41.509
...and makes time for me.

01:24:42.309 --> 01:24:43.309
Whatever.

01:24:45.908 --> 01:24:46.908
Bones!

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.891
Hello, fence.

01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:10.290
Hello, leaves.

01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:16.690
Hello, sky.
