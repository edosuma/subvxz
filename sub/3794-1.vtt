01:23.956 --> 01:26.210
- Last night was fun.
- Yeah yeah.

01:26.257 --> 01:29.849
- Do it again tonight?
- Sure. I'll call you later.

01:39.220 --> 01:41.024
I'll call you later.

01:42.563 --> 01:44.347
How pathetic are you guys?

01:44.418 --> 01:46.473
Pathetic, us?!

01:46.474 --> 01:48.539
Who tells a
first date that they love her?

01:48.540 --> 01:50.089
Oh yeah, right. I told
her that i loved her.

01:50.148 --> 01:52.572
- Looked like you were gonna tell her you loved her.
- My point exactly.

01:52.619 --> 01:54.662
- Whatever - Aw, e, thess
are just bitter

01:54.692 --> 01:56.559
- 'Cause you're on a hot streak.
- Thanks, vince.

01:56.594 --> 01:59.682
Guy's got more pussy the last
month than the previous 29 years,

01:59.735 --> 02:02.494
I wouldn't call it a hot streak, i'd
call it entering the twilight zone.

02:02.541 --> 02:04.819
That's what being a successful
manager does for you.

02:04.876 --> 02:06.990
So you're saying it has
nothing to do with him,

02:07.119 --> 02:09.133
- Just the business card?
- Yep!

02:09.955 --> 02:11.481
Ah, now i get it.

02:11.686 --> 02:13.283
So you've been banging
all these dates, e?

02:13.329 --> 02:15.243
<i>E don't bang them
that quickly.</i>

02:15.296 --> 02:17.538
E needs to be wined and
dined for at least a month.

02:17.585 --> 02:19.852
Oh no no no! I think i
heard banging last night.

02:19.887 --> 02:21.625
<i>- Was there banging, e?
- Turtle: well?</i>

02:21.854 --> 02:23.010
Was there banging?

02:23.057 --> 02:24.865
Can we talk about important stuff, please?

02:24.900 --> 02:27.261
All right, what do you
have on your mind?

02:28.088 --> 02:29.110
Are you nervous?

02:29.157 --> 02:31.881
When you're prepared, there's no need to be nervous.

02:32.063 --> 02:33.977
- It's just a driving test.
- I'm talking about leno.

02:34.253 --> 02:35.838
I'm more nervous
about the driving test.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.652
Don't take e's
aston martin then.

02:37.711 --> 02:40.118
Those pricks give you points
off just for having a fancy car.

02:40.165 --> 02:43.535
- Leno, vince. What are you gonna talk about?
- I'm open for suggestions.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.059
I've never been invited on,
so i wouldn't have any.

02:46.423 --> 02:48.830
Just tell the world how
sick the movie's gonna be.

02:48.906 --> 02:51.396
No, the clip'll say that. He needs
something that'll make a statement.

02:51.431 --> 02:53.662
Like when crispin glover
kicked letterman in the head?

02:53.720 --> 02:56.474
- Not that kind of statement.
- Besides, i'm not that limber.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.255
Tell him about how
you let those two girls

02:58.291 --> 03:00.507
Believe that they convinced you
to have a threesome last week.

03:00.554 --> 03:03.601
- I don't think that's gonna fly either, turtle.
- I'll save it for conan.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.425
Who's that?

03:06.771 --> 03:08.650
Oh, you have to be
kidding me. Who is that!?

03:08.744 --> 03:10.112
- Get back here.
- Yeah, get back here!

03:10.147 --> 03:12.836
- Hello?
- Hey, e, it's sloan.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.601
Get back here,
you miniature stud!

03:16.446 --> 03:17.644
Sorry about that.

03:17.715 --> 03:20.720
Glad to see that fame and success
hasn't changed much over there.

03:20.766 --> 03:22.680
<i>- Yeah, nothing's changed.
- Good to hear.</i>

03:22.739 --> 03:25.237
<i>- So what's up?
- It just so happens that a friend of mine</i>

03:25.275 --> 03:28.438
Desperately needs to sublet her
house to someone and i thought of you.

03:28.490 --> 03:30.251
Is that what it takes to get a call from youhese days?

03:30.298 --> 03:32.623
<i>- Phone works both ways.
- I left you a message.</i>

03:32.658 --> 03:34.232
<i>I didn't get a message.</i>

03:36.287 --> 03:40.690
E, i'm calling you now because i
thought of you when she brought this up.

03:40.691 --> 03:43.261
<i>- Why? I'm not even looking.
- I heard that you looked at a place</i>

03:43.262 --> 03:45.316
On crescent
a couple months back.

03:45.539 --> 03:47.782
<i>- Ah, keeping tabs on me, huh?
- For some reason</i>

03:47.817 --> 03:50.351
<i>My friends think i'm still
interested in your whereabouts.</i>

03:50.386 --> 03:53.465
- But you're not?
- E, do you want to look at this house?

03:53.515 --> 03:55.311
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

03:57.419 --> 03:59.004
Yeah, sure.

04:02.035 --> 04:03.325
Morning, ari.
How are you?

04:03.384 --> 04:05.140
My girl won her debate
on friday,

04:05.180 --> 04:07.436
My boy scored a goal
in soccer on saturday

04:07.446 --> 04:09.867
And my wife agreed to visit
her mother without me.

04:09.877 --> 04:11.780
- I don't know how things could get much better.
- Ari.

04:11.814 --> 04:13.928
- Give me something good, andrew.
- Greg garcia good?

04:13.963 --> 04:15.842
You signed him? I thought
he was happy where he was?

04:15.877 --> 04:17.709
Until i convinced him he'd be happier here.

04:17.755 --> 04:19.351
You hear that, everybody?

04:19.399 --> 04:22.617
"My name is earl" is now a
member of the miller gold family.

04:22.675 --> 04:25.427
Mr. Andrew klein
is responsible for that.

04:25.552 --> 04:27.997
Which means that
in this horrific economy

04:28.065 --> 04:31.094
He has secured himself a future.
All of you can do that as well

04:31.165 --> 04:34.881
If you go out there and sign someone
who can syndicate a goddamned show.

04:35.174 --> 04:37.059
- Vinnie's doing leno. You want to come?
- Love to.

04:37.106 --> 04:38.245
All right.

04:39.233 --> 04:41.487
- What's all the yelling about?
- Oh, didn't you hear?

04:41.522 --> 04:43.365
Andrew just signed another show runner.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.974
Oh, i did. Very impressive.

04:45.027 --> 04:47.481
So you either owe me an apology or a blowjob.

04:47.522 --> 04:49.389
- Your choice.
- Oh, okay, ari.

04:49.448 --> 04:52.372
I apologize. But i think
andrew should blow you.

04:52.454 --> 04:55.025
You said he was a deadbeat.
The only one sucking is you.

04:55.659 --> 04:57.914
All is well with
the miller gold agency!

04:57.972 --> 04:59.945
- Well, not all.
- What's your problem?

05:00.192 --> 05:01.929
I had dinner with
my parents last night

05:01.971 --> 05:04.425
<i>- And my father spent the entire
meal reaming me out.</i>

05:04.471 --> 05:06.274
You never told him
you liked dick?

05:06.333 --> 05:08.293
- He knew that by the time i was nine.
- I'm not following you.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.984
But the phone is ringing.

05:12.890 --> 05:15.391
I need to talk to you
about my... career.

05:15.438 --> 05:17.528
The career that you won't have
if you don't answer the phone?

05:17.587 --> 05:20.170
Ari, i will handle the
phone. Please, i need to talk.

05:20.229 --> 05:21.650
So talk.

05:22.216 --> 05:23.810
I'm so glad you're in a good mood.

05:23.869 --> 05:26.311
<i>- Who says i'm in a good mood?
- You just did!</i>

05:26.393 --> 05:28.642
You just yelled "all is well
at the miller gold agency."

05:28.674 --> 05:31.744
- That was an act to boost morale.
- Well, what's wrong?

05:31.856 --> 05:35.296
- What's right? Have you seen my stock portfolio, lloyd?
- No.

05:35.343 --> 05:37.785
And i shot
an 82 yesterday, lloyd.

05:37.844 --> 05:41.190
An 82! I missed three putts
from inside eight feet.

05:41.331 --> 05:43.726
Can you imagine missing
a hole from that close?

05:43.809 --> 05:47.578
If i lose the club championship to
chervin i will sue butch harmon's ass.

05:47.625 --> 05:48.987
- Ari!
- Yes, lloyd, yes?

05:49.045 --> 05:50.701
I want a promotion!

05:51.899 --> 05:54.658
- You do?
- I've been on your desk over three years.

05:54.799 --> 05:57.535
- I've paid my dues.
- Is this about your father?

05:58.333 --> 06:00.353
Did you know that my father
was very strict?

06:00.435 --> 06:03.381
- No.
- Yeah. He berated me and he pushed me

06:03.439 --> 06:07.678
And he insulted me
and it made me feel
very insecure and lost.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.927
But i became a man-
My own man.

06:10.015 --> 06:12.445
And now i berate
and i push.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.688
- I have noticed.
- Make your own man, lloyd.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.614
- I'm trying.
- Not trying hard enough! The goddamn phone is ringing.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.596
But, ari, we haven't
even really talked.

06:19.643 --> 06:22.015
I talked! And my hope
is that you listened.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.207
Go!

06:27.545 --> 06:29.242
No, cut it
- Cut it left. Left.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.496
- Why aren't we using cones?
- Don't talk to him, drama!

06:31.543 --> 06:34.625
- Let him concentrate.
- I got it, guys. I got it.

06:36.950 --> 06:38.735
<i>Now ease it in there.</i>

06:41.054 --> 06:43.133
- Sorry, e.
- That's okay.

06:43.421 --> 06:45.531
I'll get you
a new one.

06:45.597 --> 06:46.949
Don't worry about it.
Ahem.

06:47.005 --> 06:49.213
All right,
you're almost there.

06:52.658 --> 06:54.394
There you go.

06:56.112 --> 06:58.597
Okay, i think
you're ready.

07:00.016 --> 07:01.751
All right, everyone in!
Let's go!

07:01.851 --> 07:04.024
Oh, st. Christopher,
please protect us.

07:04.071 --> 07:07.390
- I'm gonna meet you guys over there.
- What? Really?

07:07.490 --> 07:10.303
<i>- What's the big deal?
- Vince: nothing, i guess.</i>

07:10.396 --> 07:13.862
What do you have to do that's more
important than watching me get my license?

07:15.231 --> 07:17.750
I'm just gonna meet sloan
for a coffee.

07:19.285 --> 07:22.088
- Was that sloan that called this morning?
- Yeah.

07:22.188 --> 07:24.486
- You didn't tell us.
- I don't tell you everything.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.793
<i>Well, you tell me
everything.</i>

07:27.412 --> 07:29.054
Something's up.

07:29.176 --> 07:30.697
- Definitely.
- Yeah, what's up, e?

07:30.797 --> 07:33.632
Nothing's up.
It's a coffee.

07:35.982 --> 07:39.572
20 years in this business, i don't
think i've had a sip in the office.

07:39.635 --> 07:43.974
Well, when the king of karma sends
over a $1200 bottle of scotch, you should drink it.

07:44.094 --> 07:46.513
This worked out better than i thought it would. Cheers.

07:46.613 --> 07:48.798
- Amen.
- You're drinking in the middle of the day?

07:48.898 --> 07:52.370
They do it on "mad men" all the
time and they're pretty successful.

07:52.670 --> 07:53.751
That was in the '60s.

07:53.787 --> 07:55.855
By the time they get to
season four in the '70s,

07:55.955 --> 07:58.053
- They'll all have liver and heart disease.
- Not us.

07:58.090 --> 08:01.061
- This tandem is unstoppable.
- This new team is thriving.

08:01.161 --> 08:03.930
- Glad to see somebody is.
- What, are you sulking, lloyd?

08:04.030 --> 08:07.367
No! I'm steaming. Steaming mad because
i tried to talk with you earlier

08:07.467 --> 08:09.152
And you essentially
ignored me.

08:09.252 --> 08:11.254
<i>- Are we not in a meeting?
- I don't know what you're in,</i>

08:11.354 --> 08:14.156
- But you're acting like you're in a bar.
- I don't like your tone, lloyd.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.377
- Do you have any plan to promote me?
- Hadn't even thought about it.

08:17.415 --> 08:19.062
<i>- Well, you need to.
- Lloyd!</i>

08:19.162 --> 08:21.631
Ari, promote me
or i'm leaving you!

08:21.731 --> 08:23.799
Leaving me?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.921
- Where would you go?
- To another agency.

08:28.021 --> 08:30.123
Another agency? You'd have
to start all over again.

08:30.223 --> 08:32.192
- You know that.
- Then i'll go work for my father.

08:32.292 --> 08:35.311
- What, in a dry-Cleaner's? -
My father has a winery in napa.

08:35.410 --> 08:37.645
I don't think sodomy
is legal in napa, lloyd.

08:39.349 --> 08:42.184
Every time i have broached
this subject over the years

08:42.284 --> 08:44.683
You have responded
with some wiseass comment.

08:44.721 --> 08:49.025
The time has come. I want to
know if this is going to happen.

08:49.125 --> 08:52.713
I want to know when
and i want to know today!

08:52.760 --> 08:55.272
<i>I will not be
strong-Armed, lloyd.</i>

08:55.337 --> 08:58.050
You just were,
ari gold.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.425
Tough queer.

09:05.525 --> 09:07.627
Wow, this is amazing.

09:07.727 --> 09:09.849
- I told you.
- And why is it so cheap?

09:09.952 --> 09:12.048
Because my girlfriend is
moving to vancouver for a year

09:12.148 --> 09:14.751
And she just wanted someone
she trusts to take care of it.

09:14.851 --> 09:17.337
- Oh yeah? She trusts me?
- Well, she trusts me

09:17.437 --> 09:20.056
- And i told her she can trust you.
- This her?

09:20.156 --> 09:22.702
<i>- Uh-Huh.
- Ugly.</i>

09:23.693 --> 09:25.531
- So what do you think?
- I don't know.

09:25.559 --> 09:27.425
I really haven't been
looking around much.

09:27.491 --> 09:29.599
Just trying to get an idea
what's out there, you know?

09:29.699 --> 09:32.202
This isn't out there. This
is a fluke opportunity.

09:32.302 --> 09:35.616
- I appreciate that.
- Okay. I won't push.

09:35.832 --> 09:39.025
I know what a big deal it is for you
to be out on your own without the boys.

09:39.128 --> 09:40.511
It's not a big deal.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.244
- And you hate change.
- I don't hate change.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.619
E, you moved back
into your old house.

09:45.665 --> 09:47.784
That was vince's idea.

09:48.761 --> 09:51.054
- Does he even know you're here?
- He knows i'm with you.

09:51.154 --> 09:53.188
He thinks
we're having coffee.

09:54.291 --> 09:57.961
You know, look, vince is doing
amazing. The house is great.

09:58.061 --> 10:01.264
He signed a two-Year lease thinking
we were all going to live in it, so.

10:01.364 --> 10:03.299
Well, thanks to you
he can afford it.

10:03.315 --> 10:06.309
I sunk so much money into my business,
do i really need my own place?

10:06.319 --> 10:08.504
At your age,
you kinda do.

10:09.152 --> 10:10.686
If i was in a relationship...

10:10.743 --> 10:12.809
Oh, e, we've talked
about this.

10:12.909 --> 10:16.462
You're not going to be in a relationship
so long as you're living in a frat house.

10:16.562 --> 10:20.167
We always do pick up right
where we left off, don't we?

10:20.383 --> 10:23.216
- So how is dating life?
- What?

10:23.676 --> 10:25.388
Oh, let's not get
weird about this.

10:25.488 --> 10:28.825
You're dating, i'm dating,
we can talk about it.

10:28.925 --> 10:31.528
Wow, you really are
keeping tabs on me, huh?

10:31.628 --> 10:34.797
I'm really not. But i was
forced to hear about you

10:34.897 --> 10:37.467
Stumbling out of fox hill
with a pretty young girl.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.619
And i was forced to hear
about you making out

10:39.719 --> 10:41.487
With a pretty old dude
at dan tana's.

10:41.587 --> 10:44.040
Oh, who's keeping tabs?
And you know me-

10:44.140 --> 10:47.827
- I don't make out in public.
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.

10:47.927 --> 10:50.463
I do. Who's the girl?

10:50.563 --> 10:54.182
- Girls-Ss. - Oh,
multiple girls! Wow, e.

10:54.351 --> 10:57.435
It's so unlike you.
Maybe you are maturing.

10:57.566 --> 10:58.975
Would you stop?

11:00.492 --> 11:02.308
- I gotta go.
- What should i tell my friend?

11:02.342 --> 11:04.077
- Tell her i'll think about it.
- Okay.

11:04.177 --> 11:06.346
- See you later.
- Ciao.

11:07.282 --> 11:08.964
<i>Make a right here.</i>

11:12.069 --> 11:14.970
<i>- And i need you to make a left here.
- All right.</i>

11:18.558 --> 11:21.978
- Very nice.
- Thanks, i've been working on that one.

11:23.896 --> 11:27.734
I'm excited about your new film.
"Gatsby" is one of my favorites.

11:27.763 --> 11:29.552
Oh, i hope i don't
ruin it for you.

11:29.652 --> 11:32.372
Oh no, the trailer
looked great.

11:32.870 --> 11:36.748
Love scorsese. Let's do a
three-Point turn right here.

11:36.874 --> 11:38.260
Okay.

11:45.860 --> 11:47.570
He's awful.

11:48.299 --> 11:51.107
- Don't hit that! Oh! Look at that.
- How's he doing?

11:51.207 --> 11:53.412
- Bro's bumming.
- You were supposed to get him ready.

11:53.449 --> 11:56.528
I did
- For the written. Even i couldn't get him roadworthy.

11:56.571 --> 11:58.396
He's gonna show up on set, he's
not gonna know how to drive.

11:58.414 --> 12:00.333
Hey've got stunt doubles for that.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.681
<i>Making him get his license
is for insurance purposes.</i>

12:02.728 --> 12:05.911
He's playing enzo ferrari. He
needs to know how to drive a car.

12:05.996 --> 12:08.474
- Oh!
- Oh my goodness.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.711
So?

12:15.811 --> 12:18.164
I'm finally
an independent.

12:18.185 --> 12:19.888
- You passed?
- No way! Really?

12:19.916 --> 12:20.958
Yes!

12:21.014 --> 12:23.687
Thanks so much, scott. See you at the premiere?

12:23.875 --> 12:26.044
- Plus one, right?
- You know it.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.085
Shall we?

12:28.095 --> 12:29.869
He passed you for premiere tickets?

12:29.879 --> 12:32.829
Why, cheryl walters
let me go in the back door

12:32.929 --> 12:36.197
- For "young guns 3-D" tickets.
- Oh, you're disgusting.

12:36.312 --> 12:38.349
<i>- Vince: so how's sloan?
- What do you mean?</i>

12:38.384 --> 12:40.550
- I mean how is she?
- Oh, she's good.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.438
Was that
a weird question?

12:42.609 --> 12:44.941
- No.
- 'Cause you sure answered it kinda weird.

12:44.976 --> 12:47.226
- Did i?
- Yeah. Didn't he?

12:47.427 --> 12:49.127
- Turtle: yeah.
- Kinda weird.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.229
- You're getting back together with sloan...
- No.

12:51.264 --> 12:54.886
- ... After once cup of coffee?
- You're back in love with sloan?

12:54.921 --> 12:57.916
- No.
- One cup of coffee's all it takes for this guy!

12:57.951 --> 12:59.570
- Look, it was a friendly meeting.
- Ahh!

12:59.605 --> 13:02.182
- Vince: a meeting?
- Turtle: a meeting which she called for.

13:02.217 --> 13:05.406
It's all the girls he's been
getting. Pussy can smell other pussy

13:05.441 --> 13:06.987
And then they have
to pounce on it.

13:07.022 --> 13:10.060
That's why when you're on a hot streak,
you've got to press it like blackjack.

13:10.095 --> 13:11.794
Are you pressing it
with sloan?

13:11.829 --> 13:14.118
I'm done with this conversation.
I'll see you guys at leno.

13:14.153 --> 13:15.236
- I'm riding with e.
- I'm gonna roll with you.

13:15.271 --> 13:17.921
No no no, forget that.
Come with me.

13:18.104 --> 13:20.754
- My car is here.
- We'll get it later.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.844
Can we drive
with the airbags deployed?

13:33.445 --> 13:35.982
Back in the day you waited
until your boss told you

13:36.017 --> 13:38.584
You are ready for a promotion.
You didn't threaten him.

13:38.619 --> 13:41.962
I was on terrence's desk 50 months
before he finally promoted me.

13:41.997 --> 13:44.935
- And you ever threaten him?
- The man's a psychopath. Of course i didn't.

13:44.970 --> 13:47.222
Lloyd thinks we're friends.
I'm too nice to him.

13:47.257 --> 13:49.588
That's why you can never
be nice to an assistant.

13:49.623 --> 13:52.540
- The fuck i am.
- You think lloyd would make a good agent?

13:52.575 --> 13:54.675
I don't know.
He's smart, but he's...

13:54.710 --> 13:57.558
- He's soft and he's weak.
- But you love him as an assistant?

13:57.593 --> 14:00.584
The best ever. I had 14 in
the three years before him.

14:00.619 --> 14:02.045
- But an agent- I don't!

14:02.080 --> 14:04.372
Make sure you know.
I got a few i didn't promote

14:04.407 --> 14:06.992
Make it big off of my desk,
they still won't return my calls.

14:07.027 --> 14:09.086
- You think lloyd wouldn't return my calls?
- I don't know.

14:09.121 --> 14:11.582
- Ungrateful prick.
- Nice of you to show, ari.

14:11.617 --> 14:15.396
Nice of you to drop the baby weight.
What, do you have like nine kids now?

14:15.494 --> 14:18.134
- Three, asshole.
- Really? Did you figure
out who the fathers are?

14:18.169 --> 14:21.010
Don't take it out on me because you don't
have an excuse for those extra pounds.

14:21.045 --> 14:23.329
I'm still at 6% body fat.

14:23.364 --> 14:25.965
And still 94% full of shit.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.719
Vinnie ready to make
this comeback complete?

14:27.754 --> 14:29.804
Wait wait wait!
No no no.

14:33.881 --> 14:35.993
Wait wait wait!
No no no.

14:36.028 --> 14:37.788
No, that sounds
like a disaster.

14:37.823 --> 14:39.919
- I probably hit three cones.
- But no people?

14:39.954 --> 14:41.323
No, no people.
Just cones.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.020
- So not a complete disaster?
- A little disaster.

14:44.055 --> 14:46.855
- The guy still passed you?
- Uh... yeah, but...

14:47.087 --> 14:49.663
Keep it between us
- I bribed him with a couple premiere tickets.

14:49.698 --> 14:51.099
Oh, come on!

14:51.413 --> 14:53.082
<i>No no, that's a great
trade for you.</i>

14:53.117 --> 14:55.503
Don't you understand? You
don't know how to drive!

14:56.575 --> 14:59.565
Yeah, in fact if you see me,
i'd be cautious.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.567
Now see? See, that's amazing.

15:01.602 --> 15:03.800
Being a movie star,
you get out of all this.

15:03.835 --> 15:07.125
The rest of us, we tv people, we
have to learn how to parallel park.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.910
- Here here.
- That's why i took up the motorcycle.

15:09.945 --> 15:11.698
It's small,
it's maneuverable.

15:11.733 --> 15:15.702
Plus i can try my jokes out in
biker bars. They're a great crowd.

15:15.737 --> 15:18.647
<i>No, they are.
They're a great crowd.</i>

15:18.682 --> 15:22.332
Tell me if i understand this. So
you didn't get your license till...

15:22.779 --> 15:24.219
How old are you anyway?

15:24.254 --> 15:28.554
My mom couldn't afford
to get me a car growing up.

15:29.382 --> 15:32.725
<i>- Leno: so you were poor?
- Milk it, honey, milk it.</i>

15:32.760 --> 15:35.839
- We were rich in love.
- Rich in love!

15:35.874 --> 15:36.937
<i>True dat!</i>

15:36.972 --> 15:38.334
Aw - He's doing great.
- He always does.

15:38.369 --> 15:40.380
You can afford a driver.
Why even bother to learn?

15:40.415 --> 15:44.044
I usually have my boy turtle drive
me around, but i'm doing a new movie.

15:44.079 --> 15:46.652
<i>- Leno: and what's that?
- You can still drive me around.</i>

15:46.687 --> 15:49.672
It's the story of the
race-Car inventor enzo ferrari.

15:49.707 --> 15:52.052
That might be a good movie
to learn how to drive for.

15:52.087 --> 15:53.861
- I think so.
- I don't know anything about it.

15:53.896 --> 15:56.599
I'm just throwing it out there.
Let's talk about your current movie,

15:56.634 --> 15:58.707
Which i saw last night-
Scorsese's "gatsby."

15:58.742 --> 16:02.177
- Boy, i just thought it was brilliant.
- We have our great director

16:02.212 --> 16:05.815
- To thank for that-
Martin scorsese.

16:05.850 --> 16:08.050
Sloan? She's all
over you, huh?

16:09.948 --> 16:11.464
Pussy.

16:11.499 --> 16:13.240
Hey, i can't really
talk right now.

16:13.275 --> 16:16.760
Okay okay, real quick. I swear
i'm not putting pressure on you.

16:16.795 --> 16:19.860
I just thought you should know my
girlfriend has someone else interested.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.556
Look, i haven't really thought
about it or spoken to vince.

16:22.591 --> 16:23.679
Oh, come on, e

16:23.714 --> 16:27.064
-I don't
want you to miss out on this.
-No pressure, huh?

16:27.459 --> 16:29.349
Just a little.

16:29.384 --> 16:31.831
<i>- She wants to meet you.
- Sloan, i can't rush like this.</i>

16:31.866 --> 16:33.616
Look, just come and meet her

16:33.651 --> 16:36.713
So she can approve of you in
case you decide you want it later.

16:36.748 --> 16:38.855
<i>- Can i call you back in
a little bit? - Tick-Tock.</i>

16:38.890 --> 16:41.075
<i>- Bye, sloan.
- Bye.</i>

16:42.232 --> 16:43.813
- Vince, congratulations.
- Thank you.

16:43.848 --> 16:46.249
Vincent chase, everybody.
Be right back with...

16:46.284 --> 16:48.034
Vinnie!

16:58.509 --> 17:00.752
Ari: vinnie killed it!
He did indeed!

17:00.787 --> 17:03.477
How about
we stop off to celebrate?
- Naw, i gotta go see the kids.

17:03.512 --> 17:06.733
- Family man ari gold, huh?
- Come on.

17:07.848 --> 17:09.089
<i>Yeah?</i>

17:09.125 --> 17:11.155
What's going on
with lloyd?

17:11.739 --> 17:13.704
<i>- What do you mean, baby?
- He called me.</i>

17:13.739 --> 17:16.891
<i>- He called you?
- Yes, and he sounded very upset.</i>

17:16.925 --> 17:19.413
He wanted to say how much he enjoyed
knowing me. What's wrong with him?

17:19.448 --> 17:22.269
- He- Lloyd is dying, baby.
- What?!

17:22.304 --> 17:24.959
<i>- What's wrong with him, daddy?
- Nothing, buddy.</i>

17:24.993 --> 17:26.963
Baby, tell me when
i'm on speakerphone.

17:26.998 --> 17:28.919
- Did you fire lloyd, ari?
- No-

17:28.954 --> 17:29.985
<i>- Daddy, no!</i>

17:30.020 --> 17:31.550
We love lloyd, daddy.

17:31.774 --> 17:33.317
Oooh, ruthless.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.855
He's gonna make it-
With or without you.

17:40.027 --> 17:41.710
Does that make the comeback
complete or what?

17:41.745 --> 17:43.969
No, when he's got an oscar,
then it's complete.

17:43.991 --> 17:45.798
I'd just be happy
to avoid a razzie.

17:45.808 --> 17:47.698
There's nothing wrong
with a razzie, bro.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.924
Drama's gonna go for the hat trick
if he ever gets another movie.

17:49.959 --> 17:51.887
I only have
one razzie, asshole!

17:51.922 --> 17:54.244
- All right, i'll talk to you later.
- Who was that?

17:54.868 --> 17:56.500
- Would you leave me alone?
- Never.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.935
<i>- Turtle: ever.
- Was it sloan again?</i>

18:01.114 --> 18:02.873
- Another broad?
- None of your business.

18:02.908 --> 18:05.776
I'm making it my business. So
you better tell whoever that was

18:05.811 --> 18:09.628
To invite a friend or i'm banging pots
and pans outside your door all night.

18:09.663 --> 18:12.704
You don't live here, drama. Which begs
the question, why are you always here?

18:12.739 --> 18:14.482
Because isolation's overrated. Besides,

18:14.517 --> 18:16.642
Baby bro likes
having me here.

18:16.677 --> 18:18.133
I like having
you all around.

18:18.168 --> 18:20.241
I'll stay up and bang
pots and pans.

18:20.276 --> 18:22.209
Don't you have dinner
with jamie tonight?

18:22.244 --> 18:25.422
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna tell her you asked me to find a friend.

18:25.457 --> 18:27.011
Pffft!
I didn't.

18:27.046 --> 18:29.149
Don't!
Please don't.

18:29.184 --> 18:31.300
All right, enough with the harassing e,

18:31.335 --> 18:33.765
What are the boys without
relationships doing tonight?

18:33.800 --> 18:36.698
- I got a night shoot, bro.
- Yeah, and that was sloan.

18:39.264 --> 18:41.964
We're gonna meet for
a drink. No big deal.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.009
Ari gold's office.

18:56.655 --> 18:59.113
Be at my house
at 10:00 p.M.

18:59.976 --> 19:02.129
- Your house?
- Sit on the stoop,

19:02.164 --> 19:03.509
Don't ring the bell,

19:03.544 --> 19:06.387
Don't make any noise,
wait for me.

19:07.044 --> 19:08.894
Till when?

19:09.343 --> 19:10.541
Hello?

19:12.357 --> 19:14.657
- Hey, looking sharp!
- Oh, thanks.

19:15.474 --> 19:17.748
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm just gonna hang out for a bit.

19:17.783 --> 19:20.483
- Maybe go for a spin.
- You're drinking!

19:20.629 --> 19:21.793
It's one beer.

19:21.923 --> 19:23.454
All right,
don't drive, please.

19:23.489 --> 19:26.456
Okay, thanks, ma. You know
what? If you're so concerned,

19:26.491 --> 19:28.692
Why don't you take a break from the
dating pool and come hang out with me?

19:28.727 --> 19:31.150
- It's not a date.
- Oh no, that's right.

19:31.185 --> 19:33.085
Have fun at your "meeting."

19:33.625 --> 19:36.797
Actually, vince, i didn't
have coffee with sloan today.

19:36.832 --> 19:38.247
<i>- No?
- No. A friend of hers</i>

19:38.282 --> 19:40.717
Has a great house
that she wants to sublet.

19:40.752 --> 19:42.989
Why? Sloan's got a
great house, doesn't she?

19:43.024 --> 19:45.934
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be for
her. She thought i might want it.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.455
Oh-Ho! That's why you've been
acting like a freak all day.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.587
- I haven't been acting like a freak all day.
- Yeah.

19:52.622 --> 19:55.528
Yeah, you have. If you
want to get your own house,

19:55.563 --> 19:59.398
- Go ahead, get it.
- You don't have an opinion about that at all?

19:59.433 --> 20:01.659
What opinion
would i have?

20:01.851 --> 20:05.179
Oh, come on, vince! You know
you don't like to be alone.

20:05.865 --> 20:07.509
<i>- I don't like to be alone?
- No!</i>

20:07.544 --> 20:09.426
How would you know?
You've never seen me alone.

20:09.461 --> 20:11.586
<i>Because you're always with me
because you can't be alone.</i>

20:11.621 --> 20:14.471
- Have you ever lived by yourself?
- Have you?

20:14.899 --> 20:17.099
And the guest house
doesn't count.

20:17.548 --> 20:18.825
Exactly!

20:19.400 --> 20:21.024
Besides, i got turtle.

20:21.059 --> 20:23.407
Rarely. I mean, he's usually at jamie's.

20:23.442 --> 20:25.962
Do you want to get
your own place or what?

20:25.997 --> 20:28.443
Well, yeah, i'd kinda like
to have a little privacy,

20:28.478 --> 20:31.438
<i>Not have the peanut gallery
commenting on everything that i do.</i>

20:31.518 --> 20:34.241
Maybe you want to impress sloan a
little bit with your independence?

20:34.276 --> 20:36.876
- It's not about sloan.
- Maybe a little.

20:38.117 --> 20:40.383
Come on. Get your
place, e. I'll be fine.

20:40.418 --> 20:42.826
- Don't worry about me.
- Are you sure?

20:42.861 --> 20:45.217
- Positive.
- All right, i'll see you later.

20:45.252 --> 20:47.896
- See ya.
- You know what, actually-

20:47.931 --> 20:50.927
Sloan's friend is really hot
if you want to roll with.

20:50.962 --> 20:51.962
Yeah?

20:52.828 --> 20:54.503
- I could do that.
- Yeah.

20:54.577 --> 20:56.401
We'll want to take
two cars just in case.

20:56.411 --> 20:59.354
<i>- In case what? In case you close?
- No, just in case you close.</i>

21:44.279 --> 21:46.703
To little league, growing up
and moving out on his own.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.816
- Thank you. Finally!
- Sloan: cheers.

21:48.851 --> 21:51.692
Oaso, vince, are you going to blame me
when you're feeling all sad and lonely?

21:51.727 --> 21:56.177
Why doesn't anybody think he'll be sad?
I'm really much more fun to be around.

21:56.203 --> 21:59.553
All right, you know what?
I'm usually not this pathetic,

21:59.724 --> 22:02.378
But since you took e,
i'm gonna have to take amy.

22:02.413 --> 22:05.387
- Interesting.
- Oh really? I am moving away for a year,

22:05.422 --> 22:08.827
And i'm not that interested in having
a one-Night fling with a movie star.

22:09.268 --> 22:10.518
Ouch!

22:10.726 --> 22:12.333
Wow.

22:12.412 --> 22:15.417
I'm just getting rejected
by everyone tonight, huh?

22:23.777 --> 22:26.928
That's one thing i missed
about not having a license-

22:26.963 --> 22:29.370
I don't think
i've ever fucked in a car.

22:29.405 --> 22:32.393
I'm glad i could be
your first ride.

22:51.822 --> 22:54.165
You're a cruel man,
ari gold.

22:54.595 --> 22:58.039
You asked me for an answer by day's end. I
don't have an answer; i have a proposition.

22:58.074 --> 23:01.009
And if you don't like it, you
can wander off into the cold harsh

23:01.044 --> 23:03.614
<i>- Unforgiving world without me.
- What is it?</i>

23:03.649 --> 23:05.376
100 days.

23:05.645 --> 23:08.369
You survive,
you'll have your promotion.

23:08.404 --> 23:11.003
What is this, a hazing? This
is why i didn't join a frat.

23:11.038 --> 23:12.696
- What frat would have you?
- Ari-

23:12.731 --> 23:13.815
Lloyd!

23:14.415 --> 23:18.439
100 days, you do
everything that i say,

23:18.806 --> 23:20.482
- Or you don't.
- Fine.

23:20.687 --> 23:23.193
You drop 15 lbs.

23:23.648 --> 23:26.283
- You want me to drop 15 lbs?
- I'm asking that for tom.

23:26.318 --> 23:28.918
What i want will be much harder. Now go.

23:30.470 --> 23:32.358
I'm gonna make it
through this, ari gold.

23:32.368 --> 23:36.957
It'll be worse than when you had your anal
cherry popped, but, hey, you just might.

23:44.203 --> 23:45.765
It's true.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.930
Oh, that was fun.
Thank you.

23:49.318 --> 23:51.139
- You're not gonna invite me in?
- No.

23:51.174 --> 23:53.106
- E, you're dating.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.892
- So are you!
- Exactly.

23:55.338 --> 23:58.145
Look, i thought the whole reason you
were pushing me into this place-G.

23:58.180 --> 24:00.381
Don't flatter yourself.

24:00.821 --> 24:01.821
Invite me in!

24:01.856 --> 24:03.734
E, you have girls-Ss.

24:03.983 --> 24:06.483
- That was a joke.
- It was a good one.

24:08.223 --> 24:09.824
Good night, eric.

24:10.589 --> 24:11.989
Good night, sloan.

24:13.860 --> 24:16.496
Hope i don't get too lonely
up in that house.

24:16.877 --> 24:19.027
Never lived alone
before.

24:19.173 --> 24:22.571
I mean, i lived with my mom up until
i lived with vince and the guys-

24:22.606 --> 24:25.289
- Oh, get a dog!
- Oh, so cold.

24:28.032 --> 24:29.961
Okay.
One drink.

24:30.724 --> 24:32.046
<i>Nothing more.</i>

24:32.415 --> 24:34.465
I'm serious.

24:35.001 --> 24:37.860
You didn't want to be vince's driver forever anyway, right?

24:37.895 --> 24:39.269
No, of course i didn't.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.525
It's just that vince is blowing up so fast
again

24:41.560 --> 24:45.910
- I kinda got lost in what i'm doing.
- Oh, what are you doing?

24:46.256 --> 24:47.962
I got a couple of ideas.

24:48.226 --> 24:49.513
Wh are they?

24:49.696 --> 24:51.398
No, not till
they're ready, baby.

24:51.433 --> 24:54.136
- Oh, okay. Tell me.
- No. Nice try.

24:57.338 --> 25:00.588
You know what? Just for that,
i'm peeing right in the tub.

25:03.871 --> 25:05.566
Hey, johnny,
we're running behind.

25:05.601 --> 25:07.801
Gonna be here all night.
Sorry.

25:07.836 --> 25:10.634
Don't be!
This is what i live for.

25:11.358 --> 25:13.108
Oh yeah, a little higher.

25:13.362 --> 25:15.673
Right there,
right there.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.865
Hello?
Turtle!

25:42.046 --> 25:43.951
Hello, anyone home?
