00:01.211 --> 00:02.378
Previously on Gotham...

00:02.545 --> 00:03.546
<i>GORDON:
Word of the chemical spill</i>

00:03.713 --> 00:05.882
- reached the mainland.
- Reunification isn't happening.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.383
No action until the government

00:07.550 --> 00:09.010
can determine if Gotham's safe.

00:09.177 --> 00:12.764
OSWALD: I sentence you,
Victor Zsasz, to die.

00:12.931 --> 00:14.432
- (gunshot)
' (gaspin9, Screaming)

00:14.599 --> 00:15.308
Get him out of there!

00:16.976 --> 00:18.811
What the hell are you doing?!

00:18.978 --> 00:21.189
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

00:21.481 --> 00:23.316
- Her name is Ivy.
- She's a witch.

00:25.527 --> 00:28.738
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

00:28.905 --> 00:30.114
It consumes them,

00:30.448 --> 00:31.616
and then it flourishes.

00:31.866 --> 00:32.909
We wouldn't have escaped
without you.

00:33.076 --> 00:33.952
You saved me

00:34.118 --> 00:34.953
<i>and my friends.</i>

00:35.119 --> 00:35.912
I wanted to help.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.627
- Come with us.
- Are you telling me

00:42.794 --> 00:43.962
you found a way out of Gotham?

00:44.128 --> 00:45.213
It's a submarine.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.548
I've been giving you space,

00:46.714 --> 00:48.174
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

00:48.341 --> 00:49.384
I'm gonna be a part
of this kid's life.

00:49.551 --> 00:51.886
- Oh, you seem pretty confident about that.
- I am.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.888
You're having a baby
with Barbara.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.974
Can't change the past, so...

00:56.140 --> 00:57.517
I guess we just have
to live with it.

01:04.315 --> 01:05.858
(indistinct chatter)

01:06.025 --> 01:06.818
Come on, people!

01:06.985 --> 01:08.486
Time's a-wastin'!

01:10.280 --> 01:12.991
The filtration system that
Lucius designed is working.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.868
What you're doing is both
unnecessary and it's reckless.

01:16.035 --> 01:18.830
Our supplies of drinking water
are at critical levels.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.748
Every day, the gangs
grow more aggressive.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.167
If I can get a cease-fire,
even a temporary one,

01:23.293 --> 01:25.336
then when reunification
does happen,

01:25.503 --> 01:27.171
at least there will be people
left to save.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.590
They deserve that much.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.383
And does your child
deserve a father?

01:30.550 --> 01:32.427
You have no problem taking
care of the entire city.

01:32.594 --> 01:34.429
What about focusing
on just one life?

01:34.596 --> 01:35.847
<i>(sighs) Why are you
always so ready</i>

01:36.014 --> 01:37.432
<i>to put yourself
in the crosshairs?</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:40.602
It's like you won't be satisfied
until you sacrifice yourself.

01:41.436 --> 01:42.270
You really believe that?

01:42.437 --> 01:43.104
<i>I do.</i>

01:43.396 --> 01:44.897
And it scares me.

01:46.399 --> 01:47.900
How is this gonna work?

01:48.443 --> 01:49.819
Am I supposed
to just stay at home

01:49.986 --> 01:51.446
and raise this child
with Barbara

01:51.613 --> 01:53.906
while you go cowboying off
all the time?

01:54.073 --> 01:55.575
It won't always be like this.

01:55.992 --> 01:56.993
After reunification...

01:57.160 --> 01:58.369
Nothing will be different.

01:58.620 --> 01:59.871
Unless you stop being...

02:00.038 --> 02:00.830
Me?

02:02.248 --> 02:03.082
BULLOCK:
Hey, Jim.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.376
(exhales)
I have to go.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.795
- We'll talk after.
- If there is an after.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.431
- (shouting)
- (chainsaw buzzing)

02:27.106 --> 02:28.858
Oh, yeah?! Oh-ho!

02:30.610 --> 02:32.570
Oswald, where
the hell is Nygma?

02:32.737 --> 02:34.405
Shouldn't we have left the city
already?

02:35.365 --> 02:36.240
Ms. Kean,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.534
this may come as a surprise,

02:38.701 --> 02:40.870
but building a submarine
from scratch

02:41.037 --> 02:42.955
by yourself takes time.

02:43.081 --> 02:44.749
- Patience.
- Easy for you to say.

02:44.916 --> 02:46.584
You're not
a walking egg timer.

02:47.085 --> 02:48.419
Tell him to get
a move on.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.004
And why, exactly,

02:50.171 --> 02:52.131
are you hosting Gordon's
gangland get-together?

02:52.965 --> 02:55.927
Keep your friends close and
your enemies closer, my dear.

02:56.386 --> 02:57.804
If we're really going
to leave Gotham,

02:57.970 --> 02:59.305
we need to keep Gordon happy.

03:00.515 --> 03:02.350
You know all about
that, don't you?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.394
It was a momentary slip.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.312
The world was on fire.

03:06.479 --> 03:07.480
(loud thump)

03:07.689 --> 03:09.565
(indistinct shouting)

03:13.820 --> 03:14.529
OSWALD:
<i>Jim,</i>

03:14.696 --> 03:15.780
it's your show.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.949
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

03:21.452 --> 03:23.121
I'll make this short.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.456
Gotham is running dry.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.126
Our supply of clean water

03:28.292 --> 03:30.253
will only last
a few more months.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.089
So you have a choice.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.925
You can keep killing each other,

03:36.092 --> 03:38.386
<i>fighting over
what little water is left,</i>

03:38.553 --> 03:40.638
<i>maybe eke out a few
more months, then die.</i>

03:41.264 --> 03:42.181
Or...

03:43.182 --> 03:45.268
we can all agree right now

03:45.435 --> 03:46.769
to an immediate cease-fire.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.981
(scoffing, chattering)

03:50.148 --> 03:51.357
(speaks indistinctly)

03:53.443 --> 03:55.862
The government
will not annex a war zone.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.741
If we can show them that we
deserve to rejoin the mainland,

03:59.991 --> 04:01.534
supply chain will be restored

04:01.701 --> 04:04.662
and we will all survive
until reunification.

04:06.622 --> 04:07.874
<i>That's the choice.</i>

04:08.958 --> 04:09.917
Life or death.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.419
Your call.

04:11.586 --> 04:14.505
(indistinct chatter)

04:22.513 --> 04:24.098

Get back!

04:29.437 --> 04:31.147
Jim, you see
where the shooter was?

04:31.731 --> 04:32.565
Jim.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.488
Oh, my God.

04:39.781 --> 04:41.699

04:52.835 --> 04:53.836
<i>BULLOCK:
Get back!</i>

04:54.796 --> 04:56.005
You're gonna be all right.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.882
It's bad.
We got to move him. Now.

04:58.049 --> 04:59.884
Clinic's too far.
M.E.'s office.

05:00.051 --> 05:01.010
Alvarez, come on. Help.

05:01.177 --> 05:02.136
On it.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.305
Take my gun.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.349
- (groaning)
- One, two, three.

05:06.516 --> 05:07.809
All right.
Get back.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.394
- Back! Get back!
- (shouting)

05:14.732 --> 05:15.483
Well,

05:15.650 --> 05:16.859
I did not see that coming.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.323
- (siren wailing in distance)
- (bell clanging)

05:26.118 --> 05:27.703
What made you choose this,

05:27.912 --> 05:29.247
of all places,

05:29.413 --> 05:30.998
for a scavenging mission?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.001
Just trust me, okay?

05:39.924 --> 05:41.634
What the hell?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.850
("Cherry Blossom Moon"
by Rob Parton Orchestra playing)

05:55.773 --> 05:56.566
Sit.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.569

06:07.743 --> 06:08.744

06:15.084 --> 06:16.210
<i>Wow.</i>

06:16.669 --> 06:17.712
<i>Candles.</i>

06:19.088 --> 06:20.131
If I didn't know
any better,

06:20.298 --> 06:22.341
I'd say this was
a... date.

06:28.848 --> 06:30.016
Maybe it is.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.064
That okay with you?

06:38.691 --> 06:39.775
Maybe.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.327
Good.

06:52.163 --> 06:53.247
So let's eat.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.256
Lee!

07:02.757 --> 07:03.758
<i>It's Jim.
He's lost</i>

07:03.925 --> 07:05.176
a lot of blood.
Can you save him?

07:07.803 --> 07:08.554
(exhales)

07:08.721 --> 07:09.722
Come with me!

07:10.973 --> 07:12.850
(indistinct chatter)

07:17.229 --> 07:19.231
Doc says he's gonna be okay.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.525
He's gonna pull through.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.862
But until then,
I'm acting captain.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.366
Now, the gangs of this city

07:28.908 --> 07:31.911
think this is their time
that they can run wild!

07:32.370 --> 07:33.996
They are dead wrong!

07:34.288 --> 07:35.748
I want us to take
to the streets.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.167
It is show-of-force time!

07:38.334 --> 07:40.002
We ain't gonna give 'em an inch!

07:41.170 --> 07:42.088
Harper,

07:42.254 --> 07:43.798
I want you to organize
patrol teams.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.091
What are you gonna do?

07:45.841 --> 07:48.052
I'm gonna find out
who shot my partner.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.514
THOMPKINS: The bullet
shattered against a rib.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.352
I have to get
all the fragments out.

07:57.728 --> 07:58.479
(exhales)

07:58.646 --> 08:01.107
I haven't done general surgery
since med school.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.069
There.

08:06.988 --> 08:07.905
All right,
there's an exit wound,

08:08.072 --> 08:09.573
so the rest
must've gone through.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.700
I need to sew him up.

08:10.992 --> 08:11.867
Can you get my kit?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.077
<i>Right away.</i>

08:17.164 --> 08:18.290
Come on, Jim.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.252
(distantly): You can do this,
but you have to fight.

08:21.961 --> 08:23.087
You hear me?

08:24.839 --> 08:26.090
You have to fight.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.634
II

08:34.597 --> 08:36.517

08:38.852 --> 08:40.604

Order in the court.</i>

08:41.647 --> 08:42.940
<i>James Gordon,</i>

08:43.315 --> 08:44.734
<i>you have been brought here</i>

08:44.900 --> 08:47.403

for your many crimes,

08:47.570 --> 08:50.322
and your very life hangs
in the balance.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.241
Do you understand?

08:52.700 --> 08:53.534
No, I...

08:53.909 --> 08:56.078
The defendant understands

08:56.245 --> 08:57.371
and waives his right

08:57.538 --> 08:58.789
<i>to appeal.</i>

08:59.498 --> 09:01.792
The trial of James Gordon

09:02.209 --> 09:04.920
will now begin.

09:05.921 --> 09:06.714
No! Wait!

09:11.969 --> 09:14.805

- (dog barking)

09:17.767 --> 09:18.726
That"

09:19.477 --> 09:22.021
was the best canned meal
I've ever had.

09:23.064 --> 09:24.106
<i>And if this
was a date,</i>

09:24.273 --> 09:25.232
<i>I don't know how
you're gonna top it</i>

09:25.399 --> 09:27.026
when everything gets back
to normal.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.407
I don't think
things are ever gonna be normal.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.367
<i>For me, anyways.</i>

09:36.327 --> 09:37.703
What do you mean?

09:38.788 --> 09:40.164
Wayne Manor's gone.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.502
And I know that a lot of people
lost a lot more,

09:44.668 --> 09:46.378
but part of me wonders
if it wasn't fate.

09:46.796 --> 09:48.047
(sighs)
It wasn't.

09:48.214 --> 09:50.216
It was Jeremiah
blowing up your house.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.260
Maybe it's time to move on.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.932
You mean, like, leave Gotham?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.184
<i>Bruce, forget
Wayne Manor.</i>

10:00.351 --> 10:02.061
This city is your home.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.147
And how many terrible things
have happened to it

10:05.314 --> 10:06.524
because of me?

10:08.943 --> 10:10.152
Galavan.

10:11.487 --> 10:12.696
Ra's al Ghul.

10:18.119 --> 10:20.162
If this city really is my home,

10:21.747 --> 10:22.748
then maybe
the best thing

10:22.915 --> 10:24.583
I can do for it is leave.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.836
I have to say...

10:28.963 --> 10:30.923
...kind of agree with you
on that one,

(chuckling)

10:44.228 --> 10:45.104
This could be good for us.

You especially.

Are you serious?

10:48.649 --> 10:52.570
Your baby daddy is
the top cop in Gotham.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.156
A dead Jim Gordon is

I swear to God...

11:07.751 --> 11:10.212
It wasn't me!
I merely supplied the venue!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.089
At your boss's request!

11:12.173 --> 11:13.674
That doesn't mean squat!

11:13.799 --> 11:16.385
Fine. You want to know
who's to blame?

James Gordon!

11:18.095 --> 11:20.431
He invited

(grunts, coughs)

11:25.519 --> 11:27.104
How about you, huh?

11:27.396 --> 11:30.149
When did you two become so...
buddy-buddy?

11:30.649 --> 11:31.817
Maybe when you
hatched up a plan

11:31.984 --> 11:34.361
so you could keep that baby
for yourself.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.572
Harvey, whatever
you think of me,

11:36.739 --> 11:39.575
I did not plot to kill
my child's father.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.993
Well, someone here did!

11:41.160 --> 11:43.454
Someone in this room
shot Jim Gordon,

11:43.621 --> 11:45.831
and I'm not leaving
till I find out who it was!

11:45.998 --> 11:49.126
Wrong! The shooter was not here!

11:49.293 --> 11:50.878
Look at the window, stupid!

11:51.045 --> 11:52.713
The shot came
from outside.

11:58.052 --> 11:59.929
If the shooter was there...

12:00.679 --> 12:03.140
and the trajectory was here...

12:03.724 --> 12:04.808
Jim was...

12:05.517 --> 12:06.560
then the bullet...

12:11.106 --> 12:12.066
Uh-huh.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.655
I'm gonna find out who this was,

12:18.239 --> 12:20.658
and when I do,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

12:22.076 --> 12:23.369
Harvey.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.039
Is there anything I can do?

12:27.373 --> 12:30.751
Yeah. You can keep the gangs
from tearing the city apart.

12:32.628 --> 12:33.754
(door closes)

12:35.798 --> 12:37.049
What do you want?

12:37.216 --> 12:38.425
You...

12:38.592 --> 12:40.261
I will deal with later.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.179
I'm here...

12:43.305 --> 12:44.431
...for you.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.183
I need you to come with me.

12:46.517 --> 12:47.893
Why would I do that?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.062
Because you love me so much.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.440
Well, not yet, but you will.

12:53.691 --> 12:54.942
Don't mess with him, Ivy.

12:55.109 --> 12:56.568
Protecting
your boyfriend?

12:57.403 --> 12:58.320
That's cute.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.740
But I thought
that might happen, so...

13:02.283 --> 13:03.742
I brought a friend.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.453
<i>I stumbled across
this charming man</i>

13:06.620 --> 13:07.621
<i>on the way over here,</i>

13:07.788 --> 13:10.916
and apparently,
you two know each other.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.793
Leave her out of this!

13:17.881 --> 13:20.843
You know, I heard you talking
about the future of Gotham...

13:21.760 --> 13:23.762
but Gotham will be
what <i>I</i> decide.

13:25.139 --> 13:26.724
A green world.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.644
Won't that be beautiful?

13:32.813 --> 13:33.981
(whispers):
Gorgeous.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.482
(chuckles)

13:38.444 --> 13:40.029
Bruce and I have to go.

13:42.031 --> 13:44.867
You always did think
you were better than me.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.828
But without my plants,

13:47.995 --> 13:50.456
you never would
have left your bed.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.042
I made you strong again.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.793
Think about that

13:55.085 --> 13:57.963
while my friend
is cutting out your heart.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.008
<i>IS'</i>

14:02.634 --> 14:04.636
(seabirds squawking)

14:07.765 --> 14:10.726
There are so many things
I wish I could say to you.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.645
(monitor beeping steadily)

14:16.231 --> 14:18.525
So many things
I wish we could do.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.530
This can't be the end.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.157
Come on, Jim.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.242
Talk to me.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.746
Say something.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.083
Speak.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.752
- (gavel striking slowly, rhythmically)
- No.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.754
This isn't right.
I shouldn't be here.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.672
<i>- JUDGE: Silence! Silence!
- You have to listen to me.</i>

14:40.964 --> 14:44.259
The prosecution will now give
its opening remarks.

14:47.012 --> 14:50.599
Your Honor, Jim Gordon's crimes
are a matter of public record.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.103
<i>He's failed Gotham
at every turn.</i>

14:54.812 --> 14:57.064
He failed to clean up
the city...

14:58.190 --> 15:01.068
failed to stop the bridges
from being destroyed,

15:01.568 --> 15:05.072
failed to protect
those poor, innocent souls

15:05.239 --> 15:08.033
in the refuge
he himself created...

15:08.909 --> 15:09.701
Haven.

15:09.952 --> 15:10.994
I tried.

15:11.370 --> 15:12.704
- I did the best...
- Silence!

15:12.871 --> 15:14.123
(gavel bangs)

15:14.331 --> 15:18.210
One more outburst and you
will be held in contempt.

15:22.881 --> 15:23.924
I'm hurt.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.593
I need help. Please.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.720
Continue.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.059
The issue here is not
how many people have died

15:34.226 --> 15:35.811
because of Jim Gordon,

15:36.019 --> 15:37.938
<i>but how many more must die</i>

15:38.105 --> 15:40.441
<i>in order to satisfy
his need to be a hero.</i>

15:41.191 --> 15:42.401
Therefore we pose

15:42.568 --> 15:44.528
one simple question:

15:46.280 --> 15:48.740
Are the people
in Jim Gordon's life

15:49.366 --> 15:51.994
better off with him alive

15:52.703 --> 15:53.954
<i>or dead?</i>

15:55.330 --> 15:56.832
I think I'm dying.

15:57.791 --> 15:58.917
<i>PROSECUTOR". The prosecution
would like to call</i>

15:59.084 --> 16:00.836
<i>its first witness,
Your Honor.</i>

16:04.339 --> 16:06.091
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.260
<i>IS'</i>

16:12.389 --> 16:14.600
(rapid beeping)

16:16.393 --> 16:17.644
Come on, Jim.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.021
Hold on.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.606
(door opens)

16:20.981 --> 16:22.107
How is he?

16:22.274 --> 16:23.400
Touch and go.

16:24.318 --> 16:26.278
(sighs): He's
stable for now.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.280
I removed all the
bullet fragments,

16:28.447 --> 16:30.449
but something keeps
pulling him down.

16:30.616 --> 16:31.742
Where are the fragments?

16:32.534 --> 16:34.286
(monitor beeping steadily)

16:42.461 --> 16:43.545
What is it?

16:44.213 --> 16:45.380
"V.Z."

16:46.798 --> 16:47.841
Victor Zsasz.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.887
(horn honks in distance)

16:52.054 --> 16:53.514
<i>Okey mickey .</i>

16:54.806 --> 16:55.641
Time to boogie.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.768
<i>IS'</i>

17:06.944 --> 17:07.694
ZSASZ:
Hey!

17:07.861 --> 17:09.445
I'm only here for Gordon.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.031
So all of you stay down.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.034
<i>'Cause I see anyone...</i>

17:14.617 --> 17:16.161
and, you know...

17:17.954 --> 17:18.829
bang.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.040
Oi, oi!

17:23.460 --> 17:25.628
Now, I heard you were looking
for Jim Gordon.

17:25.921 --> 17:26.880
<i>(weakly):
Uh-huh.</i>

17:31.176 --> 17:33.554
Listen, I know we have history.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.598
Let's just let bygones
be bygones.

17:36.765 --> 17:37.808
Yeah, right.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.435
You did this to my face.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.270
<i>Whatever.</i>

17:41.728 --> 17:44.147
It's not like you were much
of a looker before, anyway.

17:44.982 --> 17:47.442
(growls) Ivy says you
hurt her feelings.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.986
Why would you do that!?

17:49.695 --> 17:50.946
She's so sweet!

17:51.071 --> 17:52.990
(roaring)

17:54.408 --> 17:55.909
Ivy didn't make me strong.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.160
I made me strong.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.412
(grunts, chokes)

17:58.579 --> 18:00.289
Tell me where she took Bruce.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.254
<i>The only reason I'm not
ending you right now</i>

18:08.171 --> 18:09.673
is the thought of
the look on your face

18:09.840 --> 18:11.550
when Jim Gordon walks
through that door.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.885
Because he's alive,
you son of a bitch!

18:14.052 --> 18:16.638
Ugh. What did you eat?

18:16.888 --> 18:18.307
You smell like a butcher.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.267
You know, I'm vegan now.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.060
Why kill Jim now?

18:22.978 --> 18:23.687
Makes no sense.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.564
He saved your
miserable ass.

18:25.731 --> 18:29.234
He prevented Penguin
from executing you.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.321
If anyone, you should be
going after Cobblepot.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.239
Yeah, that's a good point.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.241
Maybe I'll do him next.

18:37.326 --> 18:38.785
It's kind of not up to me.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.704
You're working for someone?

18:40.871 --> 18:42.039
(whispers):
Oh.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.125
Sorry.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.211
(grunting)

18:48.378 --> 18:49.421
I want a name!

18:49.630 --> 18:51.757
Ah, what's in a name?

18:52.507 --> 18:54.676
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.553
You know,
I'm really taking the time

18:56.720 --> 18:58.555
to stop and smell the roses
these days.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.390
Like, actual roses.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.309
They're great.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.769
Are you high?

19:03.935 --> 19:04.936
On love.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.396
But like I said...

19:07.773 --> 19:08.732
my lips are sealed.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.111
(Snaps fingers)
Ivy Pepper.

19:14.488 --> 19:15.572
You said it, not me.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.741
Uh, I'm technically
not allowed to say it.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.451
Her name. Which is
such a bummer,

19:19.618 --> 19:21.745
because it's the most beautiful
name in the world.

19:22.120 --> 19:22.913
You watch him.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.289
I could say it all day.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.957
Hey, I <i>will</i> say it all day.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.125
Ivy.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.502
IVY Pepper.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.212
Mrs...

19:30.379 --> 19:31.463
Ivy Pepper Zsasz.

19:31.630 --> 19:32.631
Oh, that sounds good.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.139
Here you are,
Miss Thompkins.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.141
Careful, it's...
a little bit hot.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.603
Forgive me, but I...

19:47.020 --> 19:49.439
heard on the grapevine
that you and Captain Gordon

19:49.606 --> 19:51.400
had a rather heated exchange
this morning.

19:51.566 --> 19:52.734
<i>Oh, God.</i>

19:53.235 --> 19:54.403
Was it that bad?

19:54.945 --> 19:55.696
Apparently,
it was like a session

19:55.862 --> 19:57.030
of the Italian parliament.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.448
(sighs heavily)

20:04.663 --> 20:05.956
You have misgivings

20:06.164 --> 20:08.625
about the arrival
of this child, don't you?

20:10.752 --> 20:13.004
What am I getting
myself into, Alfred?

20:13.672 --> 20:16.049
How am I supposed
to raise a child

20:16.216 --> 20:18.593
alongside a psychopath
like Barbara Kean?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.971
I mean, how the hell
is this gonna work?

20:21.471 --> 20:24.057
But... but that's
not all of it.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.310
If Jim and I are gonna do this,
then we have to do it together.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.687
You know how he is.

20:29.146 --> 20:29.896
I don't know
what's going on

20:30.063 --> 20:31.648
inside that man's
head sometimes.

20:31.982 --> 20:33.608
I think you'll find
that he needs you

20:33.775 --> 20:35.235
a lot more than
he's letting on.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.280
Well, I need to
hear it from him.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.493
I never thought that this was
how my life was going to be.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.372
I have no interest
in being a father myself.

20:48.123 --> 20:51.084
I always presumed that
I was unfit to be one.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.588
And then I found myself...

20:55.630 --> 20:57.799
one night staring
down an alley at this little boy

20:57.966 --> 21:00.927
quite literally
shaking with fear.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.055
I don't know, it's funny,
isn't it, what life throws you?

21:04.681 --> 21:09.102
I'm keenly aware that I am not
Master Bruce's flesh and blood.

21:09.561 --> 21:10.979
But it's the moments.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.483
The little things, like...

21:15.025 --> 21:17.235
like when he uses a skill
that I once taught him,

21:17.402 --> 21:20.322
or we laugh at a joke
that only he and I share.

21:21.531 --> 21:24.284
Those have been some of the most
ecstatic moments of my life.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.746
Nothing can possibly
prepare you for that joy.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.707
The hows and the whats...

21:31.500 --> 21:33.210
you'll figure that stuff out.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.129
What matters is this:

21:36.463 --> 21:38.924
you'll be an exquisite mother,

21:39.508 --> 21:43.261
and that child, he or she
will be extraordinary...

21:45.013 --> 21:46.264
...because of you.

21:46.765 --> 21:49.309
<i>IS'</i>

21:50.977 --> 21:52.187
(sniffles)

21:52.354 --> 21:53.855
Thank you, Alfred.

21:58.568 --> 21:59.736
(sniffles)

22:05.075 --> 22:06.993
Jim, can you hear me?

22:10.038 --> 22:11.540
I'm right here,
right next to you.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.795
<i>Can you feel me?</i>

22:18.588 --> 22:19.798
Lee?

22:20.048 --> 22:22.676
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.679
<i>You've suffered at this man's
hands more than anyone.</i>

22:26.805 --> 22:28.056
Broken heart,

22:29.307 --> 22:30.559
broken engagement.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.353
A lost child.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.773
And yet, you're still with him.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.150
I love him.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.736
<i>After all the pain
he's caused you,</i>

22:43.029 --> 22:44.197
would your life be better,

22:44.364 --> 22:46.867
could it not still be better,

22:47.784 --> 22:49.035
without Jim Gordon?

22:51.371 --> 22:52.789
Answer the question.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.875
- Lee?
- <i>PROSECUTOR: I'll ask it</i> a <i>different way.</i>

22:55.125 --> 22:57.502
Would you, Dr. Lee Thompkins,

22:57.794 --> 23:00.922
be better off
if Jim Gordon were dead?

23:02.883 --> 23:03.884
I'm sorry.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.637
Everything he touches dies.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.515
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.394
You made her say that.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.646
<i>PROSECUTOR". I didn't
make her say anything.</i>

23:16.855 --> 23:18.064
Ask them.

23:18.315 --> 23:20.317
(whooshing,
flames hissing)

23:20.483 --> 23:21.568
<i>GORDON:
Who are they?</i>

23:21.735 --> 23:24.154
<i>PROSECUTOR". More people who
trusted you, who believed you</i>

23:24.321 --> 23:27.574
when you said you
would protect them.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.118
They're from Haven.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.496
I think I'm dying.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.125
And isn't it about time?

23:40.170 --> 23:41.212
The verdict's in.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.548
You're guilty.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.763
(wind whistling)

23:52.349 --> 23:53.892
Hey, Jeff, listen to me.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.101
One day, you're
gonna meet someone

23:55.268 --> 23:56.519
who's gonna totally
change your life,

23:56.895 --> 23:58.438
and that's gonna
make you happy,

23:58.647 --> 24:00.523
and you deserve it.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.736
Or not.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.155
<i>Is she here?</i>

24:07.322 --> 24:08.615
She's here, isn't she?

24:11.159 --> 24:12.410
Sweetie.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.872
All I asked of you

24:16.790 --> 24:18.541
was to kill Jim Gordon.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.460
You're not angry, are you?

24:20.627 --> 24:22.337
'Cause I'll do it.
I'll do it right now.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.299
I'll do it.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.802
You keep the cops busy.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.473
Luckily, the other part of my
plan is coming together nicely.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.155
(steam hissing)

24:59.040 --> 25:00.125
Lucius!

25:00.709 --> 25:01.501
Bruce.

25:02.127 --> 25:04.004
I had no idea
you were stopping by.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.465
I wanted to check
on your progress.

25:07.924 --> 25:11.052
Well, the toxicity levels
in this river continue to drop.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.513
At this point, we'll be under
the threshold mandated

25:13.722 --> 25:15.515
by the government
sooner than expected.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.517
It's not glamorous work,
but we are helping

25:17.684 --> 25:19.686
to save the lives
of thousands of people.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.855
People. Ugh.

25:22.981 --> 25:25.316
I'm sorry. Did you just say
"People. Ugh"?

25:25.483 --> 25:27.569
Lucius,
what if I were to tell you

25:27.736 --> 25:30.155
I have in my possession
the most intoxicating perfume

25:30.321 --> 25:31.489
you'll ever smell?

25:31.740 --> 25:33.658
I would tell you that's
an abrupt change of topic.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.202
Can we go back to the part
where you said "People. Ugh"?

25:37.245 --> 25:38.413
(grunts)

25:38.997 --> 25:40.040
Mmm.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.003
(echoing):
Oh, my... goodness.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.296
<i>Lucius,</i>

25:46.379 --> 25:48.506
Ivy sent me here to get you
to shut down the plant.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.300
<i>Can you do
that for her?</i>

25:50.633 --> 25:53.344
(distorted):
For Ivy? Anything.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.472
She is so great.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.730
♪ They say, they say
she's got to grow up ♪

26:03.897 --> 26:07.192
♪ And they say, they say
she's got to get a job ♪

26:07.358 --> 26:10.987
♪ I know, I know
I'll never be like the rest ♪

26:11.154 --> 26:13.698
♪ Of the bunch. Oh! ♪

26:14.199 --> 26:15.658
Raise your glasses.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.369
I called you all here today

26:18.536 --> 26:21.247
because Jim Gordon is
at death's door.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.666
ALL:
Yeah!

26:23.833 --> 26:25.668
For years, he has hounded us,

26:25.835 --> 26:28.088
beaten us, shot us.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.422
<i>And today, he got his due.</i>

26:29.923 --> 26:32.467
To Jim Gordon.
May he rot in hell!

26:32.634 --> 26:34.677
ALL:
Yeah!

26:34.844 --> 26:37.514
<i>IS'</i>

26:38.223 --> 26:39.724
What exactly are you doing?

26:39.974 --> 26:42.352
I'm trying to keep this city
from ripping itself apart.

26:43.019 --> 26:46.439
So this has nothing to do
with your feelings for Jim?

26:46.773 --> 26:49.150
What if Ed fails,
and we are stuck here?

26:49.859 --> 26:51.945
<i>This will put us in
Gordon's good graces.</i>

26:52.237 --> 26:53.988
Consider it a backup plan.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.449
<i>IS'</i>

26:57.117 --> 26:58.201
<i>Listen up!</i>

26:58.785 --> 27:01.287
Now to the real reason
I brought you all here.

27:02.831 --> 27:03.498
<i>I want you</i>

27:03.665 --> 27:06.543
to agree to an immediate truce.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.545
(laughing):
Get out of here.

27:08.711 --> 27:12.298
And what if, instead,
we shoot you and take your club?

27:13.508 --> 27:14.926
I don't think so.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.178
See, those drinks
I just gave you--

27:17.846 --> 27:18.721
they're poisoned.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.600
<i>And you had two shots
before everyone got here.</i>

27:23.017 --> 27:25.103
So that should be taking effect
around...

27:25.436 --> 27:27.814
(muffled groaning)

27:29.774 --> 27:31.276
(choking)

27:31.985 --> 27:33.611
- (indistinct muttering)
- ...now.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.406
The rest of you have 48 hours
before you'll need

27:36.573 --> 27:38.575
<i>the antidote, which
I will deliver to you,</i>

27:38.783 --> 27:40.743
<i>provided you go back
to your territories,</i>

27:40.910 --> 27:43.997
play nice,
and send me all your guns. Deal?

27:46.082 --> 27:47.542
I said, "Deal?"

27:47.709 --> 27:49.419
(all voicing assent)

27:49.586 --> 27:51.004
- Now get out of here!
- MAN: All right.

27:51.171 --> 27:53.214
- Yeah. Out.
- Come on.

27:55.049 --> 27:56.009
Hmm.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.636
Jim will be so pleased.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.514
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.392
Isn't that right... Pengy?

28:18.156 --> 28:19.782
Once I reverse the system,

28:19.949 --> 28:22.493
all the toxin we pulled from
the river will be rereleased,

28:22.660 --> 28:24.621
and the overload should
destroy the filters.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.497
In a matter of minutes,

28:26.706 --> 28:29.500
the entire facility
will be inoperable.

28:30.752 --> 28:31.461
There.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.880
- (alarms sounding)
- Perfect.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.132
Ivy's gonna be so happy.

28:36.507 --> 28:37.634
You think so?

28:38.176 --> 28:40.553
<i>MAN (over PA):
Security breach. Zone 1.</i>

28:41.304 --> 28:42.472
That's odd.

28:53.316 --> 28:54.484
Selina.

28:56.736 --> 28:57.820
I'll take care of it.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.364
Okay.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.700
All right, listen up!

29:03.159 --> 29:06.746
I know you're probably familiar
with Ivy Pepper.

29:06.996 --> 29:07.997
In fact, you were probably here

29:08.164 --> 29:11.292
when she hypnotized the whole
frigging precinct, okay?

29:11.459 --> 29:12.835
She is on the loose,

29:13.044 --> 29:15.421
and we've got to find her
and take her down.

29:15.630 --> 29:16.839
Actually, fellas,

29:17.090 --> 29:19.384
- she's already here!
- (gun chamber clicking)

29:19.550 --> 29:21.594
(indistinct shouting)

29:25.014 --> 29:27.558
That's right.
Ivy came and freed me.

29:27.725 --> 29:29.894
That is true love for you.

29:31.604 --> 29:34.565
She really understands
what makes me tick.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.067
- Don't worry, though.
- (yells)

29:36.234 --> 29:37.485
I'm just a distraction

29:37.652 --> 29:40.363
so she can finish off Jim
once and for all.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.448
You know,
that's how great couples work.

29:44.367 --> 29:45.702
Maybe I shouldn't have
told you that.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.287
Oh, well.

29:54.711 --> 29:56.629
(distant, rapid gunfire)

29:57.463 --> 29:59.299
- I'm sorry, Miss Thompkins.
- I know. Go.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.675
Thank you, Alfred.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.052
Come on, Jim.

30:03.594 --> 30:04.637
Can you hear me?

30:04.971 --> 30:06.097
Stay with me.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.016
(echoing):
Stay with me, Jim.

30:08.182 --> 30:09.976
(indistinct chatter)

30:13.021 --> 30:13.771
BULLOCK:
Jim!

30:13.938 --> 30:16.024
(laughs)
Want a drink?

30:16.190 --> 30:18.443
Alvarez makes
a hell of a Mai Tai.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.611
I can barely feel my face.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.488
Harvey, what is this?

30:22.947 --> 30:24.365
It's your wake.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.242
Pretty nice turn-out, huh?

30:26.909 --> 30:30.580
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

30:30.747 --> 30:32.248
- ♪ For he's a jolly good ♪

♪ Fellow ♪

30:33.499 --> 30:36.461

♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

30:42.091 --> 30:43.343

30:43.509 --> 30:44.886

30:45.053 --> 30:46.095
(piano continues playing tune)

30:46.262 --> 30:47.555
I'm not dead yet.

30:47.972 --> 30:49.974
Well, be a little bit
of a bummer

30:50.183 --> 30:52.185
to have it after you died,
don't you think?

30:53.311 --> 30:54.979
I'm gonna have a kid, Harvey.

30:57.315 --> 31:00.193
How do I protect that child
when everything around me dies?

31:02.236 --> 31:03.237
<i>Harvey?</i>

31:05.740 --> 31:07.367
WILL: That's
a good question.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.122
Will.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.875
You said I'd be
safe in Haven.

31:16.501 --> 31:17.585
I trusted you.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.212
<i>I know.</i>

31:19.629 --> 31:20.922
I did my best.

31:22.173 --> 31:24.384
Your best never seems
good enough.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.469
It's time to go.

31:34.602 --> 31:35.728
- (beeping) -
THOMPKINS: No, no, no.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.730
- No, no, no, no. Jim.
- (long, continuous beep)

31:37.897 --> 31:39.440
- Where's my adrenaline?
- (distant, rapid gunfire)

31:39.899 --> 31:41.234
Oh...

31:47.115 --> 31:49.617
Oh, looks like
Victor succeeded after all.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.042
I guess I'll have
to settle for killing you.

32:03.965 --> 32:04.757
I can tell you one thing.

32:04.924 --> 32:08.010
I am sick and tired of getting
shot at in my own precinct.

32:09.262 --> 32:10.888
Hey, what the bloody
hell's going on?

32:11.055 --> 32:12.432
I thought you had this
lunatic locked up.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.434
Ivy broke him out
and gave him an arsenal.

32:14.809 --> 32:17.103
But I have an idea. I got to get
to the storeroom. Give me cover.

32:17.937 --> 32:18.896
Alvarez, go!

32:19.313 --> 32:20.898
(grunts)

32:24.527 --> 32:25.945
(grunting)

32:26.112 --> 32:27.155
(gasps)

32:27.363 --> 32:28.823
(panting)

32:29.031 --> 32:29.991
Why are you doing this?

32:30.408 --> 32:31.951
What has Jim ever done to you?

32:32.535 --> 32:35.830
Gotham has a chance
to be born anew.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.082
To return to
what it was

32:38.249 --> 32:41.836
before people ripped down the
trees and paved over the earth.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.671
He's trying to reunify
with the mainland

32:43.838 --> 32:44.922
to save all these people.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.299
A return to filth.

32:47.425 --> 32:48.259
Poflufion.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.179
He's fighting for
death, while I...

32:51.888 --> 32:52.972
promise life...

32:53.598 --> 32:55.016
in its purest form.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.188
Is that your plan?

33:00.354 --> 33:02.482
To have the plants take over
Gotham by killing Jim?

33:03.191 --> 33:04.984
Oh, killing Gordon's
just the first part.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.653
Bruce Wayne is taking
care of the rest.

33:08.029 --> 33:10.740
- For what it's worth, I am sorry.
- For what?

33:16.370 --> 33:17.497
(gasping breath)

33:18.915 --> 33:20.458
This pain is nothing

33:21.042 --> 33:23.377
compared to what you
are about to feel.

33:25.588 --> 33:27.632
Say good-bye...
to Jim Gordon for me.

33:27.798 --> 33:28.466
No!

33:28.633 --> 33:29.842
<i>No, no, no,
no, no!</i>

33:30.384 --> 33:31.260
No!

33:33.513 --> 33:34.555
Jim.

33:39.852 --> 33:40.686
Selina, you're wasting

33:40.853 --> 33:41.562
your time.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.523
Bruce, you have
to snap out of lvy's spell.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.358
- This is not you.
- You're wrong.

33:45.525 --> 33:46.817
Ivy's given me a purpose.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.319
(grunting)

33:48.486 --> 33:50.988
Stop! Stop! I don't
want to fight you!

33:51.656 --> 33:54.200
What are you gonna do?
Kill everything in Gotham?

33:54.492 --> 33:56.244
The toxins will only kill
all the people.

33:56.744 --> 33:58.162
The plants will adapt;
they always do.

33:58.496 --> 34:00.498
- Can you hear what that sounds like?
- Yeah.

34:01.040 --> 34:01.999
It sounds great!

34:05.711 --> 34:07.255
(coughing)

34:08.172 --> 34:10.591
(panting)

34:11.384 --> 34:13.427
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

34:13.844 --> 34:16.097
You don't care about Gotham.
You're gonna leave anyway.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.560
What about the
rest of us, huh?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.061
The ones who
are gonna be

34:22.228 --> 34:23.603
stuck here without you?!

34:23.980 --> 34:24.897
Selina...

34:25.565 --> 34:28.568
(both gasping for breath)

34:28.734 --> 34:30.485
<i>Selina...
I'm okay.</i>

34:30.652 --> 34:32.612
- Bruce, I'm so sorry.
- We got to stop Lucius.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.239
- Come on.
- Okay.

34:34.991 --> 34:35.741
(grunts)

34:35.908 --> 34:37.284
(alarm blaring)

34:37.493 --> 34:39.786
Lucius! You have
to stop the shutdown.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.873
Oh, no, I can't do that.

34:44.041 --> 34:45.710
Ivy will be so mad.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.920
Listen to me, I-l used
lvy's perfume to hypnotize you.

34:49.170 --> 34:49.880
She's using you.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.841
No.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.552
Ivy would never do that.

34:54.969 --> 34:58.389
We're perfectly bonded,
like... carbon and oxygen

34:58.556 --> 34:59.473
or hydrogen

34:59.640 --> 35:02.268
- <i>and oxygen...</i>
- We do <i>not have time for this.</i>

35:02.435 --> 35:03.436
I'm sorry.

35:04.895 --> 35:05.813
(grunts)

35:07.982 --> 35:09.650
- (flips switch)
- There.

35:09.859 --> 35:11.235
Oh, you kicked me
in the head.

35:11.402 --> 35:12.987
I didn't have
a choice, Lucius.

35:13.321 --> 35:14.739
Bruce, where's Ivy?

35:18.826 --> 35:20.411
She was headed to the GCPD.

35:24.248 --> 35:26.042
I wonder what lvy's doing
right now.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.669
BULLOCK:
Hey, lover boy.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.342
Are you serious right now?

35:34.508 --> 35:35.885
As a heart attack.

35:42.183 --> 35:43.809
(chuckles)

35:43.976 --> 35:44.977
What an idiot.

35:46.604 --> 35:48.064
- (Bullock yelling)
- Oh, my...

35:51.901 --> 35:53.110
(grunts)

35:56.656 --> 35:57.865
Ah, that felt good.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.283
Come on, Jim.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.202
You fight for everyone else.
You never give up.

36:01.369 --> 36:03.079
Fight for yourself, Jim.
Come on!

36:09.627 --> 36:11.545
(thunder crashing)

36:17.343 --> 36:19.011
(door creaking)

36:20.763 --> 36:22.056
(thunder crashing)

36:25.726 --> 36:27.019
It's time.

36:40.574 --> 36:42.118
(thunder crashing)

36:42.743 --> 36:43.411
THOMPKINS (echoing):
Jim.

36:52.336 --> 36:53.212
<i>Lee.</i>

36:54.505 --> 36:55.423
<i>Is that...?</i>

36:56.006 --> 36:57.091
Yes.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.011
Do you want to...?

37:06.225 --> 37:07.309
I don't know.

37:09.437 --> 37:10.938
I don't know that I can.

37:13.190 --> 37:14.233
Oh, I see.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.027
- No!
- Good-bye, Jim.

37:17.611 --> 37:18.446
<i>No!</i>

37:18.612 --> 37:20.072
I want to live!

37:20.489 --> 37:21.615
<i>I want to live!</i>

37:21.782 --> 37:23.033
It's too late.

37:24.326 --> 37:25.661
No! I want to live!

37:26.495 --> 37:27.872
(screaming)

37:28.038 --> 37:29.206
(monitor beeping rapidly)

37:29.373 --> 37:30.875
(baby bawling)

37:31.500 --> 37:33.252
(gasping breaths)

37:33.919 --> 37:35.296
(beeping slows)

37:35.588 --> 37:37.590
(gasping breath)
Lee.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.800
Don't move.
Don't move.

37:41.761 --> 37:43.053
How do you feel?

37:44.221 --> 37:45.973
Like I almost died.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.601
Well, you didn't.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.103
You fought.
You came back to me.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.646
Because I need you.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.066
<i>Lee...</i>

37:56.776 --> 37:58.652
- this child...
- It's okay.

37:59.862 --> 38:01.489
It's okay to be scared.

38:04.742 --> 38:06.118
The only thing scarier
than doing this

38:06.285 --> 38:08.078
is doing it without you.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.210
Can I ask you something?

38:19.340 --> 38:21.926
<i>IS'</i>

38:22.092 --> 38:24.053
(bell tolling)

38:29.642 --> 38:31.435
<i>IS'</i>

38:31.519 --> 38:33.437
(indistinct chatter)

38:42.822 --> 38:44.281
BRUCE:
He seems nervous.

38:44.490 --> 38:45.533
SELINA:
I know.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.284
He should be thrilled.

38:48.744 --> 38:51.664
Marrying a woman who's smarter
and better-looking than him.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.127
Selina, while we
were fighting,

38:57.461 --> 38:59.129
when I was hypnotized,
you talked about me leaving...

38:59.338 --> 39:00.172
Quiet.

39:01.048 --> 39:02.299
Here she comes.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.804
<i>IS'</i>

39:27.449 --> 39:30.160
You may sit.
(chuckles)

39:33.581 --> 39:34.415
<i>BULLOCK:
I'm just gonna say,</i>

39:34.582 --> 39:36.792
this isn't gonna be some
long, drawn-out, tearful affair

39:36.959 --> 39:38.043
like you all are used to, okay?

39:38.210 --> 39:39.295
This is gonna be
a short wedding.

39:39.461 --> 39:42.047
I'm gonna try and make it quick
so we can all get to the bar.

39:42.256 --> 39:44.300
' (laughter)
<i>'</i> Qkay?

39:45.259 --> 39:47.094
<i>I first met a young Jim Gordon</i>

39:47.803 --> 39:49.430
when he was a, uh...

39:49.597 --> 39:51.515
pain-in-the-ass, moralistic

39:51.682 --> 39:53.767
- rookie detective.
- (laughter)

39:54.184 --> 39:57.646
In the years since, he's evolved
into a pain-in-the-ass,

39:57.813 --> 39:59.398
moralistic captain.

40:00.524 --> 40:03.360
<i>I'd say he's my best friend,</i>

40:03.527 --> 40:06.530
but in truth,
he's my only friend.

40:08.866 --> 40:10.576
So we'll skip that.

40:11.035 --> 40:13.203
Uh, on to Lee.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.873
<i>Lee's always had his back.</i>

40:16.415 --> 40:18.208
Except for the time
when she was infected

40:18.375 --> 40:21.545
with the crazy-making virus
and she tried to kill him,

40:21.712 --> 40:22.838
<i>but that's love.</i>

40:24.131 --> 40:25.549
<i>But I will say,</i>

40:25.966 --> 40:28.135
if there's one beautiful thing
that's happened

40:28.302 --> 40:31.305
<i>over these last few crazy years,</i>

40:31.472 --> 40:34.850
it's that these two people
met each other.

40:35.476 --> 40:36.810
<i>And that truly is...</i>

40:37.603 --> 40:38.979
<i>a beautiful thing.</i>

40:41.023 --> 40:42.900
Jim, will you please
take Lee's hand?

40:44.109 --> 40:44.985
(clears throat)

40:45.903 --> 40:49.531
<i>Do you, Jim Gordon,
take Lee Thompkins to be</i>

40:49.949 --> 40:51.492
<i>your lawfully wedded wife,</i>

40:51.659 --> 40:53.202
to have and to hold,

40:53.827 --> 40:55.204
from this day forward,

40:55.746 --> 40:57.164
<i>for better, for worse,</i>

40:57.665 --> 40:59.583
<i>for richer, for poorer,</i>

41:00.668 --> 41:03.087
in sickness and in health,

41:03.837 --> 41:05.172
to love and cherish

41:05.673 --> 41:07.049
<i>till death do you part?</i>

41:08.092 --> 41:09.301
I do.

41:11.804 --> 41:13.847
And you, Lee Thompkins,
do you do the same?

41:15.182 --> 41:16.475
Sure, Harvey.

41:17.643 --> 41:18.852
I do.

41:21.605 --> 41:23.607
By the power vested in me...

41:24.483 --> 41:26.777
by absolutely no one...

41:26.944 --> 41:28.028
(laughter)

41:28.195 --> 41:29.822
...I now pronounce you

41:30.572 --> 41:33.075
husband and wife.

41:33.409 --> 41:37.579
(cheering, whistling)

41:37.746 --> 41:40.249
<i>IS'</i>

41:56.181 --> 41:57.224
What?

41:59.059 --> 42:01.020
<i>IS'</i>

42:12.156 --> 42:14.074
<i>(applause fades)</i>

42:17.369 --> 42:20.914
And now Jim Gordon
and Lee Thompkins

42:21.123 --> 42:23.584
are man and wife.

42:24.293 --> 42:27.755
<i>Thank God you held the
city together so that</i>

42:27.921 --> 42:30.507
this blessed event
could take place.

42:33.427 --> 42:34.803
<i>It was never
gonna work.</i>

42:36.805 --> 42:37.556
What?

42:37.723 --> 42:40.434
<i>Controlling the gangs
was not a backup plan.</i>

42:41.185 --> 42:43.145
You... saw a chance

42:43.312 --> 42:46.190
to convince James Gordon
that you had changed.

42:47.316 --> 42:49.443
But he will never see you

42:49.610 --> 42:52.112
<i>as anything but
a dangerous woman</i>

42:52.279 --> 42:54.114
<i>keeping his
child from him.</i>

42:54.865 --> 42:56.366
Then I'd best be long gone

42:56.533 --> 42:58.619
before he
can do anything about it.

43:01.163 --> 43:04.374
He will hunt you
till the ends of the earth.

43:04.958 --> 43:05.751
(chuckles)

43:09.463 --> 43:10.589
Let him.
