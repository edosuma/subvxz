You're getting queasy, too?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.574
No, it's my amulet.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.743
I've gotta get to
the secret library.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.748
I'm here, I'm here.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.483
Don't start without me.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.521
"The Tale of
the Noble Knight."

01:29.523 --> 01:30.789
That sounds interesting.

01:37.630 --> 01:40.432
NARRATOR:  <i> In the far-off</i>
<i> kingdom of Brazendell,</i>

01:40.434 --> 01:42.634
<i> dragons roamed</i>
<i> the mountains,</i>

01:42.636 --> 01:44.736
<i> while people lived</i>
<i> in the villages.</i>

01:44.738 --> 01:46.738
<i> For as long as</i>
<i> anyone could remember,</i>

01:46.740 --> 01:49.475
<i> the two always</i>
<i> left each other in peace,</i>

01:49.477 --> 01:52.711
<i> until one day,</i>
<i> for reasons unknown,</i>

01:52.713 --> 01:54.813
<i> the dragons began</i>
<i> setting fires</i>

01:54.815 --> 01:56.915
<i> all over</i>
<i> the countryside.</i>

01:56.917 --> 01:58.951
<i> The king of Brazendell</i>
<i> declared</i>

01:58.953 --> 02:00.953
<i> that whoever could</i>
<i> stop the dragons</i>

02:00.955 --> 02:03.555
<i> would be named</i>
<i> First Knight,</i>

02:03.557 --> 02:05.491
<i> leader of all knights.</i>

02:05.493 --> 02:07.793
<i> So Oliver, the strongest</i>
<i> knight in the land,</i>

02:07.795 --> 02:11.630
<i> vowed to defeat the dragons</i>
<i> and become First Knight.</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:13.632
<i> To do this,</i>
<i> he had to find</i>

02:13.634 --> 02:16.568
<i> the magical ice fire</i>
<i> shield,</i>

02:16.570 --> 02:19.571
<i> which had the power</i>
<i> to freeze dragon fire.</i>

02:19.573 --> 02:21.907
<i> This special shield</i>
<i> could only be found</i>

02:21.909 --> 02:24.843
<i> by following a trail</i>
<i> of riddles and clues.</i>

02:24.845 --> 02:28.747
<i> However, a rival knight</i>
<i> named Sir Jaxon</i>

02:28.749 --> 02:30.849
<i> also wanted</i>
<i> the ice fire shield,</i>

02:30.851 --> 02:34.586
<i> so he set out</i>
<i> to trap Sir Oliver.</i>

02:34.588 --> 02:36.522
But Sir Oliver said he was
going to use the shield

02:36.524 --> 02:37.856
to help people.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.592
I wonder what Sir Jaxon's
going to do with it.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.994
<i> In order for</i>
<i> the kingdom to be safe,</i>

02:41.996 --> 02:44.930
<i> it is vital that</i>
<i> the most noble knight</i>

02:44.932 --> 02:46.698
<i> gets the shield.</i>

02:46.700 --> 02:48.600
<i> But in the land of</i>
<i> Brazendell,</i>

02:48.602 --> 02:51.637
<i> things are not always</i>
<i> what they seem.</i>

02:51.639 --> 02:54.606
It's my job
as Storykeeper

02:54.608 --> 02:55.941
to finish the story.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.943
So I have to help
the most noble knight

02:57.945 --> 02:59.811
find the ice fire shield.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.847
I need to get Minimus.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.684
Sofia, I still
don't understand

03:05.686 --> 03:07.953
why we're flying towards
mean, fire-breathing dragons

03:07.955 --> 03:09.655
instead of away from them.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.823
Because we have to help
a noble knight

03:11.825 --> 03:13.692
get a special shield.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.993
We might not even
see any dragons.

03:14.995 --> 03:18.030
Uh, then what are those
up ahead?

03:18.032 --> 03:20.866
- SOFIA: Dragons!
- What do we do?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.702
- Where do I go?
- Down, Minimus.
Hide under that rock.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.044
- Whew!
- The good news is,

03:32.046 --> 03:34.880
if we're seeing dragons,
we must be in Brazendell.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.715
That's your idea
of good news?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.884
I see the tower
from the book.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.786
Let's go.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.055
Look, Sofia.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.826
- That's gotta be
Sir Oliver.
- How do you know?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.561
He looks like
a noble knight.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.829
Yeah, he sure does.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.831
And I don't even
know what noble means.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.701
It means being
honest, kind and brave.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.069
Sir Oliver said he's
getting the shield

03:57.071 --> 03:58.937
to protect people
from dragons.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.906
Will he protect
flying horses, too?

04:00.908 --> 04:03.842
Because if he will,
he's my new hero.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.712
He won't be able
to protect anyone
if he gets trapped.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.946
We've got to warn him
about Sir Jaxon.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.083
Stop. Wait.
Mr. Sir Oliver!

04:11.085 --> 04:13.352
Hold on, Sofia.
This may be bumpy.

04:17.023 --> 04:19.925
Ho now. Move aside,
fair lass.

04:19.927 --> 04:23.862
I have an urgent
knightly matter to attend to.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.865
I give that landing
two stars.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.801
- Out of five?
- Out of ten.
- Okay.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.770
You're Sir Oliver,
right?

04:31.772 --> 04:32.971
What gave it away?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.873
My brawny physique,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.608
my rugged good looks?

04:36.610 --> 04:40.712
I know.
My can-do smile.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.649
Actually, I saw your picture
in a book in a library.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.617
So there is
a book about me.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.052
I knew it!

04:47.054 --> 04:49.655
I am a legend
in my own time.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.723
( clears throat )

04:51.725 --> 04:54.760
- And you are?
- Princess Sofia.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.895
And I'm here to help
the noble knight of Brazendell

04:56.897 --> 04:58.664
get the ice fire shield.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.733
There is no nobler
knight than I.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.070
But you help me?
Hold on a moment.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.840
( chuckles )

05:08.842 --> 05:11.143
( raucous laughter )

05:11.145 --> 05:12.911
Okay, done.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.813
I appreciate the offer,
princess,

05:14.815 --> 05:17.949
but I do not think
a brave knight such as I

05:17.951 --> 05:22.054
needs help from
a wee little girl such as ye.

Don't just stand there.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.995
Get me out of
this contraption.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.967
This blasted net
is clearly the work

07:15.969 --> 07:17.869
of Sir Jaxon.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.771
That rapscallion!

07:19.773 --> 07:21.072
If you're going to
call me names,

07:21.074 --> 07:23.208
say them to my face,
Sir Oliver.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.910
Sir Jaxon?

07:24.912 --> 07:26.878
'Tis he, in the flesh.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.115
Looks like someone's miffed
that I trapped him.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.983
Miffed?! Pshaw.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.219
I am here to find
the ice fire shield,

07:34.221 --> 07:36.288
you desperado.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.957
Leave at once,
or face my sword.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.293
Well, I pick the second one.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.229
I cannot let you
get the shield, Ollie.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.932
- En garde!
- Don't, please.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.068
You heard the princess.
Surrender, coward.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.904
Methinks not.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.173
This ends now.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.309
Does it,
or does it end now?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.077
No, now.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.980
Forsooth, you are
a mighty adversary,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.149
but let us see how well
you fight without a sword.

08:06.018 --> 08:09.087
Ah! Well played, sir.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.991
No matter. A true knight
needs no sword.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.293
Stand still,
you slippery snake.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.964
You have to be quicker
than that, Sir Slowcoach.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.334
You would do well to curb that
wagging tongue of yours, varlet.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.870
And you would do well
to pay more attention

08:24.872 --> 08:26.238
to what you are doing.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.975
I learned that move
in knight school.

08:29.977 --> 08:33.178
And I shall see to it
that it is the last move

08:33.180 --> 08:35.313
you ever make.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.049
Please, both of you,
put your swords down.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.118
Not possible, milady.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.187
This knight must be stopped

08:42.189 --> 08:45.290
from trying to stop me
from stopping the dragons.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.293
And you must be stopped
from making awful speeches
like that.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.963
You know
those dragons aren't dangerous.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.899
Ha! You fool.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.134
They are starting fires
all over the kingdom.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.936
I don't know
who to believe.

08:59.071 --> 09:00.906
( laughing )

09:00.908 --> 09:03.141
I learned that move
in art school.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.043
Is that so?

09:05.045 --> 09:08.914
Well, X marks the spot
for a big liar.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.215
( laughing )

09:10.217 --> 09:11.316
Why would I lie?

09:11.318 --> 09:12.918
Why would you not lie?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.352
You didn't answer
my question.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.188
You did not answer
my question.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.090
Stop, please!

09:19.092 --> 09:21.359
Can't you both put
your swords down

09:21.361 --> 09:22.994
so we can just
talk this out?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.262
Yes, the lady
has a point.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.331
Let us have a truce.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.967
No more fighting.
I promise.

09:30.202 --> 09:34.039
All right. Truce.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.207
Oh, good. That wasn't
so hard, was it?

09:36.209 --> 09:37.375
Not at all.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.344
It was all too easy.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.348
I've got you now.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.256
That was
a dirty trick.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.358
He's right. That was
a dirty trick.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
You said you were
putting down your sword.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.229
I would say anything
to save you from
that ruffian.

09:58.231 --> 10:02.033
For I am a noble knight
who always helps others.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.269
Except if they are
scoundrels.

10:04.271 --> 10:08.073
Now, legend has it
that the shield is hidden

10:08.075 --> 10:11.042
somewhere in this room.
But where?

10:11.044 --> 10:13.111
I couldn't find it,
and neither will you.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.412
Quiet, you scoundrel.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.214
Come now, fair lass.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.283
We mustn't let him
distract us from our task.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.121
Hm. Nothing under here.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.389
Not here.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.125
Not here.
Nothing in the teapot.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.462
How befuddling.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.298
Oh. Mmm.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.266
( whistles and laughs )

10:35.268 --> 10:37.202
Oh, boy.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.346
- ( gasps )
- What ho, a gasp.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.415
Is it the ice fire shield?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.250
Well, it's a shield.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.185
I see I shall
have to use

10:54.187 --> 10:58.156
my finely honed
sword-wielding skill
to extract it.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.025
Ah! Sword-wielding skill.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.127
'Tis a lot smaller
than I expected.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.428
But mayhap it just
looks that way

11:03.430 --> 11:06.431
next to my enormous muscles.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.500
How, pray tell, is
this tiny thing

11:08.502 --> 11:10.435
supposed to stop
dragon fire?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.303
There's something written
on the glass.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.439
"If the shield
you want to hold,

11:14.441 --> 11:17.142
look through here to find
a rock of gold."

11:17.144 --> 11:19.377
This is a clue to help us
find the real shield.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.180
But where are we
supposed to find
a golden rock?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.449
Maybe it's the rock
between your ears,

11:24.451 --> 11:27.285
where your brain should be.
( laughing )

11:27.287 --> 11:29.287
Why, you...
Stop laughing at once.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.157
Sir Oliver,
the clue.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.092
It said to look
through here.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.262
There's a gold rock
on that hill.

11:38.397 --> 11:41.199
Huzzah! I found it!
We must go at once.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.134
Excuse me.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.170
There's still a knight
trapped in here.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.206
You aren't going to just leave
Sir Jaxon in there, are you?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.308
You don't expect me
to let him go free

11:50.310 --> 11:52.243
so he can
trap me again.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.479
I think not,
silly girl.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.549
- But I don't--
- Oh, he'll find
a way out eventually.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.218
He is quite resourceful,
you know.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.220
As am I.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.562
Highly impressive, yes?

12:10.564 --> 12:13.364
Sofia, are you okay?
I heard a lot of
bangin' around in there.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.400
I'm okay, but after
we find the shield,

12:15.402 --> 12:18.069
we have to come back
to let Sir Jaxon out.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.504
Come, princess.
Our quest awaits.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.339
( sighs )
Take me down.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.208
Let's head to
the golden boulder.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.344
Follow my lead,
everyone.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.579
This way.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.149
Uh, Sir Oliver,
it's that way.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.487
Precisely.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.424
Follow me.

12:46.532 --> 12:49.200
Now, where is it?

12:49.202 --> 12:51.436
- There's the golden--
- Rock! Right there.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.405
- You're welcome for
pointing it out for you.
- Huh?

12:54.407 --> 12:57.475
Now, search high and low
for the ice fire shield.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.544
Leave no stone unturned.

13:03.315 --> 13:04.549
Does that include
this one?

13:04.551 --> 13:06.484
( Minimus groaning )

13:06.486 --> 13:08.453
Step aside,
winged steed.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.556
Important noble knight
business, you know.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.493
I don't think
I like that guy.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.229
He's a noble knight,
and the book said

13:18.231 --> 13:20.231
I should help him.
Look at that.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.368
There's something carved
on the side of that rock.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.437
Sir Oliver.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.640
- I think I found--
- A clue.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.643
Yes, my keen eyes
have spotted a clue.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.412
What, pray tell,
does it say?

13:34.414 --> 13:37.248
"If you wish
to find the shield,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.317
look through the hole
this one does yield."

13:39.319 --> 13:41.252
Utterly confounding.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.587
Even the wisest
of the wise

13:42.589 --> 13:44.656
could not decipher
such a riddle.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.658
Found it.

13:47.593 --> 13:50.428
There's a cave
shaped like a shield.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.263
It's across
the valley.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.333
The ice fire shield
must be there.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.268
We must go at once.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.636
Odds bodkins.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.506
That dastardly Sir Jaxon
has returned.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.608
He must've escaped
from the tower.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.443
He is resourceful.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.611
I shall not let
that troublemaker

14:06.613 --> 14:08.580
get anywhere near
that shield.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.484
Sir Oliver, what are you
going to do?

14:13.486 --> 14:17.388
I do hope Sir Jaxon
is wearing his waterproof armor.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.524
Wait. Are you going
to open that dam?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.693
What if there's
a village nearby?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.695
Fear not,
fair princess.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.197
The nearest village
is miles from here.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.299
The water could
never reach it.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.634
But what about
Sir Jaxon?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.636
If you open the dam,
he could drown.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.472
Tish-tosh.
He'll have a brisk swim,

14:34.474 --> 14:36.207
but he'll be fine.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.475
Sir Oliver, wait.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.378
Whoa, my noble steed.

14:41.580 --> 14:44.315
That is far enough,
Sir Jaxon.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.251
Don't you dare
do it, Ollie.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.553
A noble knight must do
what it takes

14:48.555 --> 14:50.321
to accomplish his deed.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.390
With the ice fire shield
at my side,

14:52.392 --> 14:53.691
I can protect
the innocent folk

14:53.693 --> 14:55.727
from those
terrible dragons.

14:55.729 --> 14:59.264
It is the dragons
who need protecting
from the likes of you.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.432
Enough of this
foolish banter.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.269
- Farewell, Sir Jaxon.
- No, wait!

15:04.271 --> 15:07.405
May this water wash away
your cowardly presence

15:07.407 --> 15:08.506
from Brazendell.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.609
( screaming )

15:13.445 --> 15:16.447
That's it. Run away.
( laughing )

15:16.449 --> 15:19.284
Oh, bother.
I've splashed myself.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.551
Come, Princess Sofia.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.686
To the cave we go.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.755
But Sir Jaxon's
in trouble.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.591
- Quite.
- Well, I'm going
to help him.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.393
Suit thyself.

15:28.395 --> 15:32.597
Zero stars for
a bad decision.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.768
Come on, Minimus.
There's no time to lose.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.704
He's going to be
swept away.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.776
Get down close to him.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.446
Grab my hand.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.682
Up, Minimus.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.520
Set him down over there.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.733
Milady, I am in your debt.
Thank you.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.336
Now I need
your flying horse

16:11.338 --> 16:14.605
so I can stop that weasel,
Sir Oliver.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.574
No. I saved you
from the flood,

16:16.576 --> 16:19.510
but I can't let you stop
Sir Oliver from getting
the shield.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.512
- He needs it to protect
people from the...
- ( screeching )

16:21.514 --> 16:22.580
Dragons!

16:24.650 --> 16:26.417
Don't be frightened, milady.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.353
There is no reason
to fear them.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.821
Except they might
roast us.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.422
That's one reason.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.794
SOFIA:
They're all around us.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.596
MINIMUS:
We're surrounded.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.665
They won't hurt us.
I won't let them.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.534
Hurt you?
Why would we do that, love?

16:43.536 --> 16:46.838
We saw the floodgates
open and thought you might
need some help.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.606
You wanted to help us?

16:48.608 --> 16:51.676
Ooh, who is your new
little friend, Sir Jaxon?

16:51.678 --> 16:54.512
She is just darling.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.849
I just want to wrap you up
and give you a great big hug.

16:57.851 --> 17:01.452
Oh. ( giggles )
Tickles.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.821
Come, come, Willawing,
leave the princess alone.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.523
You know these dragons?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.559
Most certainly.
We are dear old friends.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.528
He's the only person
in Brazendell

17:10.530 --> 17:12.663
who ever thought to
pay us a visit,

17:12.665 --> 17:15.533
and we're talking dragons,
so we welcome the chit-chat.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.568
But I read in a book
that you were setting fires

17:17.570 --> 17:19.404
all over the kingdom.

17:19.406 --> 17:23.374
They only breathe fire
to protect themselves,
milady.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.543
Normally, we never
hurt a fly.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.745
But that Sir Oliver
keeps trying to drive us off,

17:27.747 --> 17:30.548
and we have no choice
but to defend ourselves
with fire.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.384
Why would Sir Oliver want to
make you start fires?

17:33.386 --> 17:36.687
Sir Oliver wants to make
the dragons appear dangerous

17:36.689 --> 17:39.690
so he can stop them,
and look like a big hero.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.727
He wants the king to
name him First Knight.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.763
When it's really Sir Jaxon
who's the best knight around.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.665
And the sweetest.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.769
Oh, well. Oh,
that's a little too tight.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.839
So then, the noble knight
I'm supposed to help

17:54.841 --> 17:57.708
isn't Sir Oliver;
it's you, Sir Jaxon.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.610
You should get
the ice fire shield.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.579
He certainly should.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.482
Well, all I know is,
if Sir Oliver gets it,

18:04.484 --> 18:06.717
he'll drive
the dragons away for good.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.619
We've got to stop him.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.621
So you'll let me ride
your flying horse?

18:10.623 --> 18:13.558
Sir Jaxon, I have
a better idea.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.727
Maybe it's time you took
your first dragon ride.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.962
Most assuredly.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.667
Tally ho!

18:25.737 --> 18:27.872
This way.
Come on!

18:27.874 --> 18:29.874
Can you believe,
a few minutes ago,

18:29.876 --> 18:32.710
I was scared of
giant dragons,
and now look at me.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.879
I'm flyin' with 'em.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.517
Scared again.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.788
There's the cave
with the shield.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.959
I've done it.
This quest is at an end.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.828
I have retrieved
my quarry!

18:50.830 --> 18:52.563
Just as I feared.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.966
Sir Oliver
found it first.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.570
You're too late,
Sir Jaxon.

18:59.572 --> 19:03.774
Behold, the ice fire shield.
( laughs )

19:03.776 --> 19:05.743
Now nothing can stop me

19:05.745 --> 19:08.479
from vanquishing
these beastly dragons.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.848
You're not vanquishing
anything, Oliver.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.718
We shall see
about that, rogue.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.021
I hope this thing works.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.827
Ha ha, it does!

19:22.829 --> 19:24.862
Surrender,
foul beasts.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.797
We've got to get
that shield away from him.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.700
Do not waste
your dragon breath.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.936
Victory, victory,
victory!

19:31.938 --> 19:33.771
And more victory.

19:33.773 --> 19:37.008
Victory once again.
( laughing )

19:37.010 --> 19:38.776
Ha ha!

19:38.778 --> 19:40.945
Ho ho!

19:40.947 --> 19:42.713
Fool.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.650
Mere snowballs cannot
penetrate the ice fire shield.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.686
No, but they may be enough
to distract you from this.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.792
Now's our chance
to get the shield. Go!

19:54.794 --> 19:56.861
Blast! Return my sword.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.729
- SOFIA: Got it.
- No!

20:00.032 --> 20:02.700
Ten out of ten, Sofia!

20:05.537 --> 20:07.772
Get back,
you foul creatures.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.649
What goes on here?

20:18.651 --> 20:20.885
My king.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.888
We saw the dragon fire
all the way from the castle.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.991
Sir Jaxon, what trouble
are you causing now?

20:26.993 --> 20:28.893
Your Majesty, I am
Princess Sofia,

20:28.895 --> 20:30.728
and I have
something to tell you.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.698
Sir Oliver is the only one
here causing trouble.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.067
But he is my bravest
and strongest knight.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.002
Sir Oliver has been
starting fights

20:38.004 --> 20:40.738
with the dragons, even though
they never did anything to him.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.740
That's why they were
setting fires.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.676
The dragons are friendly,
Your Majesty.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.679
Sir Oliver, why would you
do such a thing?

20:48.681 --> 20:51.616
Because those dragons
are a menace, sire.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.850
They are not.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.886
Sir Oliver goaded them
into breathing fire

20:55.888 --> 20:58.623
so he could defeat them
with the ice fire shield,

20:58.625 --> 21:01.626
and look like
a  <i> big hero.</i>

21:01.628 --> 21:04.895
And then, you would
make me First Knight.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.998
Did I say that out loud?
( nervous chuckle )

21:10.769 --> 21:12.103
I see.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.105
The shield,
if you please.

21:16.908 --> 21:20.611
The ice fire shield should
belong to the most noble knight

21:20.613 --> 21:21.979
in the land,

21:21.981 --> 21:24.782
and that is you,
Sir Jaxon.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.718
You did your best to help
these innocent dragons,

21:27.720 --> 21:30.721
even when it made life
harder for yourself.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.958
Therefore,
I hereby declare you

21:33.960 --> 21:36.627
First Knight of the Realm.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.962
I am honored,
Your Majesty.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.930
And as for you,
Sir Oliver,

21:39.932 --> 21:42.933
not only have you lied,
but you have risked the lives

21:42.935 --> 21:45.069
of both creature
and countryman.

21:45.071 --> 21:48.939
I hereby banish you
from this land.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.641
Banish me?!

21:50.643 --> 21:51.942
This is an outrage.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.911
I demand a recount.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.746
I promise you,

21:55.748 --> 21:57.982
you've not heard
the last of Sir Oliver.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.752
I promise to only use
this shield

22:01.754 --> 22:03.921
for the protection
of others.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.824
( cheering )

22:10.829 --> 22:14.065
Princess Sofia, I could not
have done it without you.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.671
<i> And that is how</i>
<i> the ice fire shield</i>

22:20.673 --> 22:25.076
<i> was given to the truly</i>
<i> noble knight of Brazendell.</i>
