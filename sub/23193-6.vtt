WEBVTT

00:09.477 --> 00:10.544
- LIFE, IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE,

00:10.578 --> 00:12.213
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.246 --> 00:13.381
I'M A REVIEWER,

00:13.414 --> 00:14.482
BUT I DON'T REVIEW FOOD,

00:14.515 --> 00:15.949
BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.052
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:18.086 --> 00:21.089
VIVA LA REVOLUCION!

00:23.191 --> 00:25.193
[screams]

00:32.333 --> 00:34.602
WELCOME TO REVIEW.
I'M FORREST MACNEIL.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.971
AS USUAL, I'LL BE REVIEWING
WHATEVER EXPERIENCES YOU SEND IN

00:38.005 --> 00:41.409
THAT ARE, IN TURN, HANDED OFF
TO ME BY MISS A.J. GIBBS.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.144
- LET'S DO IT.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.980
OUR NEXT EMAIL COMES TO US FROM
CHARLES IN FRANKLIN, TENNESSEE.

00:47.014 --> 00:49.650
HE WRITES...

00:58.392 --> 00:59.960
- OH, BOY.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.263
WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO HAVE ROAD RAGE?

01:02.296 --> 01:05.233
[growls]

01:05.266 --> 01:07.401
MOTHER[bleep]!

01:07.435 --> 01:10.371
I HAD ALWAYS FOUND DRIVING
VERY RELAXING,

01:10.404 --> 01:13.006
BUT I WOULD HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO LET OTHER PEOPLE'S DRIVING

01:13.040 --> 01:15.843
DRIVE ME INTO A FULL-ON RAGE.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.778
GET OUT OF MY [bleep] WAY.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.048
I GASSED UP AND WENT SEARCHING
FOR AUTOMOTIVE OUTRAGES.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.417
OKAY, THE TRAFFIC IS REALLY
HEAVY OVER THERE,

01:23.451 --> 01:24.918
SO IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO GET INTO THAT,

01:24.952 --> 01:25.953
AND THEN THERE'LL
BE REALLY SOME THINGS

01:25.986 --> 01:27.255
TO GET MAD ABOUT.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.522
DENSE TRAFFIC.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.191
OH, GREAT.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.726
I'M STUCK BEHIND A [bleep]--
WHAT IS THAT, A TRACTOR?

01:32.760 --> 01:35.563
DON'T DRIVE A TRACTOR
ON THE STREET IN TRAFFIC.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.266
JUST SO I'M CLEAR,
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL

01:38.299 --> 01:40.634
TO GIVE SOMEONE
THE FINGER, RIGHT?

01:40.668 --> 01:42.436
BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF GIVING
SOMEONE THE FINGER.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.937
BUT IT'S NOT ILLEGAL, RIGHT?

01:43.971 --> 01:44.938
YOU DON'T GET ARRESTED
FOR THAT, DO YOU?

01:44.972 --> 01:45.939
- NO.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.175
- HURRY UP, GRANDMA!

01:47.175 --> 01:48.209
[horn honks]

01:48.242 --> 01:49.410
THEY'VE BEEN DOING CONSTRUCTION

01:49.443 --> 01:51.945
ON THIS STREET FOR FOUR MONTHS!

01:51.979 --> 01:53.614
ENOUGH!

01:53.647 --> 01:55.783
I MEAN IT'S AN IMPORTANT
DRAINAGE PROJECT,

01:55.816 --> 01:59.487
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT IT'S INFURIATING.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.190
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M REALLY
FEELING ALL THE ANGER

02:02.223 --> 02:05.793
I NEED TO HERE,
BUT I'LL TRY AGAIN.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.828
I SAW PLENTY OF CARELESSNESS,

02:07.861 --> 02:10.198
BUT NONE OF IT WAS HARMFUL
TO ME, PERSONALLY,

02:10.198 --> 02:12.400
UNTIL, FINALLY, I GOT LUCKY.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.001
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

02:14.034 --> 02:16.069
THIS GUY'S PASSING ME
ON A TWO-LANE STREET.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.471
[horn honks]
HEY, JACK-WHACK.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.373
THAT'S FOR YOU,
THE MIDDLE FINGER!

02:19.407 --> 02:20.408
EAT IT!

02:20.441 --> 02:22.042
OH.
OH, OKAY.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.245
HERE WE GO.
IT IS ON.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.215
COME WITH ME.
ROAD RAGE IN ACTION.

02:27.215 --> 02:30.351
HEY, YOU DON'T PASS SOMEBODY
ON A TWO-LANE STREET!

02:30.384 --> 02:31.585
THAT'S NOT SAFE.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.087
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
OH, AH, NO, NEVER MIND.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.389
IT'S FINE.
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,

02:35.423 --> 02:36.557
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.558
I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SAFE

02:37.591 --> 02:40.228
TO GO ON A--PASS--OH.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.262
HEY, EXCUSE ME.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.596
UH, WAIT A MINUTE.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.232
PLEASE DON'T GET IN MY CAR.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.899
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

02:45.933 --> 02:47.935
WHERE YOU GOING?

02:54.141 --> 02:56.344
PLEASE COME BACK!

02:56.377 --> 02:59.547
THE COWARDS WHO DROVE OFF IN
MY CAR ROBBED ME OF THE CHANCE

02:59.580 --> 03:02.683
TO EXPERIENCE A TRUE ROAD RAGE
CONFRONTATION.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.853
TO DO THAT NOW, HOWEVER,
I WOULD NEED ANOTHER CAR.

03:05.886 --> 03:09.122
- NO WAY.
NOBODY TOUCHES MY WHEELS.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.158
- PLEASE, JUST FOR TODAY.
- FORGET IT.

03:11.259 --> 03:15.028
THE LAST GUY I LOANED MY CAR TO
TURNED OUT TO BE A SEAT SNIFFER.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.097
THERE WERE PICTURES OF MY SEAT
ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.666
- NO.
- YEAH.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.768
- GOD.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.371
WELL, YOU KNOW
I'M NOT A SEAT SNIFFER.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.938
- NO.
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

03:24.972 --> 03:28.809
FYI, I LOCK MY OFFICE CHAIR
UP AT NIGHT,

03:28.842 --> 03:32.112
SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

03:32.145 --> 03:36.183
- MY SECRETARY HAD GONE INSANE,
BUT MY INTERN CAME THROUGH.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.352
HIS ONLY CONDITION WAS
THAT I GIVE HIM A LIFT

03:38.386 --> 03:41.389
TO DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
AT A MARIJUANA DISPENSARY.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.691
I WASN'T IN A POSITION TO ARGUE.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.993
- OH, DON'T TAKE THE DUCT TAPE
OFF THE STEERING COLUMN

03:46.026 --> 03:48.496
OR THE STEERING WHEEL
WILL COME OFF IN YOUR HANDS.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.863
- REALLY?
- YEP.

03:49.897 --> 03:50.864
- DOES THE HORN WORK?

03:50.898 --> 03:51.999
[horn honks]
GOOD.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.367
- I JUST BOUGHT NEW BELTS

03:53.401 --> 03:54.835
AND GOT OIL FOR IT.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.169
- YOU JUST PUT A BUNCH
OF MONEY INTO THIS CAR?

03:56.203 --> 03:57.471
- YEAH.
- REALLY?

03:57.505 --> 03:58.706
YOU THOUGHT
THAT WAS A GOOD THING

03:58.739 --> 03:59.807
TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY?
- TOTALLY.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.443
HEY, ISN'T THAT YOUR WIFE?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.111
- THAT IS MY WIFE.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.813
- WHO'S THAT GUY SHE'S WITH?

04:05.846 --> 04:08.449
- I DO NOT KNOW.

04:08.482 --> 04:12.786
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

04:12.820 --> 04:18.058
OH, THAT'S HER DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.593
- WHY DO YOU STILL NEED
A DIVORCE LAWYER,

04:19.627 --> 04:22.763
LIKE, AFTER YOUR DIVORCE
IS DONE?

04:22.796 --> 04:26.334
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.470
- WHAT IF SHE WAS [bleep] HIM?
[laughs]

04:29.503 --> 04:31.171
THEN THEIR PROFESSIONAL
RELATIONSHIP

04:31.204 --> 04:37.077
WOULD BE A BLOW-FESSIONAL
FELLA-TIONSHIP.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.579
- THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST
DISGUSTING THINGS

04:38.612 --> 04:39.847
I'VE EVER HEARD.

04:39.880 --> 04:40.848
- THAT'S, LIKE,
THE FUNNIEST THING

04:40.881 --> 04:41.849
I'VE EVER SAID.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.083
- WELL, IT'S DISGUSTING.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.084
PLEASE DON'T SAY IT AGAIN.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.187
- SORRY.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.989
- BOY, THEY REALLY ARE
LAUGHING A LOT.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.524
- YEAH, THEY'RE PROBABLY
LAUGHING ABOUT

04:50.558 --> 04:55.195
HOW GIGANTIC HIS DICK IS.
[laughs]

04:58.866 --> 05:02.403
- OH, MY GOD.

05:02.436 --> 05:07.375
SHE IS [bleep] HER LAWYER.

05:07.375 --> 05:11.512
- OH, OKAY, THIS BUSINESS LUNCH
JUST BECAME A JIZZ-NESS MUNCH.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.546
- SHUT UP!

05:16.283 --> 05:17.785
- I KNEW SOMETHING
WAS HAPPENING WITH THEM

05:17.818 --> 05:19.186
THE FIRST TIME I SAW
THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.421
SHE IS [bleep]
HER DIVORCE ATTORNEY!

05:20.454 --> 05:22.155
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- NO!

05:22.189 --> 05:25.493
I NOW UNDERSTOOD THAT ROAD RAGE
IS JUST LIKE REGULAR RAGE,

05:25.526 --> 05:27.695
EXCEPT THAT IT
USUALLY HAPPENS IN A CAR.

05:27.728 --> 05:31.198
IT MUST COME FROM WITHIN
AND I HAD PLENTY OF IT NOW.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.300
I ASKED MY INTERN
TO THROW MORE LOGS

05:33.401 --> 05:35.268
ON THE RAGING FIRE IN MY HEART.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.506
SAY MORE INAPPROPRIATE THINGS
ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.641
- I DON'T WANT TO--
- TALK ABOUT THE [bleep] JOBS

05:40.674 --> 05:42.142
AND THE [bleep].
DO IT!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.811
- OKAY, WELL,
THEY JUST GOT TOGETHER, SO...

05:43.844 --> 05:45.413
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- THEY'RE PROBABLY TRYING STUFF

05:45.413 --> 05:46.847
THE TWO OF YOU WEREN'T
COMFORTABLE DOING.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.450
LIKE, HE'S PUTTING
LEGAL STUFF IN HER BUTT.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.218
AND HE'S LAYING HER
ON THE GROUND

05:51.251 --> 05:52.720
AND THEN PICKING HER UP
BY HER BOOBS.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.121
- KEEP GOING!

05:54.154 --> 05:56.156
- THERE'S, LIKE,
PICTURES OF YOUR KIDS.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.958
HE'S MAKING EYE CONTACT
WITH THE PHOTOS

05:57.991 --> 05:59.893
WHILE HE [bleep] HER
IN THE BUTT.

05:59.927 --> 06:05.633
- [screams]
[horn honks]

06:05.666 --> 06:08.268
OH, WHAT THE--THAT SON
OF A BITCH JUST CUT ME OFF!

06:08.301 --> 06:09.937
HEY, [bleep] YOU,
YOU PIECE OF [bleep]!

06:09.970 --> 06:11.605
[tires screech]
[bleep] YOU!

06:11.639 --> 06:14.241
- OH, THIS IS AMAZING.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.610
- OKAY, THIS [bleep] IS ON.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.078
YOU JUST [bleep]
WITH THE WRONG GUY.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.613
WHAT THE [bleep]
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

06:19.647 --> 06:20.948
- I'VE GOT YOUR BACK,
MR. MACNEIL.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.315
- I'M TRYING TO
[bleep] DRIVE, HERE!

06:22.349 --> 06:23.451
YOU BLOW THROUGH
THAT STOP SIGN LIKE THAT!

06:23.451 --> 06:24.752
DON'T [bleep] DO THAT TO PEOPLE!

06:24.785 --> 06:25.986
YOU GOT A STOP SIGN,

06:26.019 --> 06:27.455
YOU STOP AT THE [bleep]
WHITE LINE!

06:27.488 --> 06:29.222
- MR. MACNEIL!
- OH, YEAH.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.091
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
OKAY.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.293
HEY, [bleep], IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING HAPPENED

06:33.326 --> 06:35.763
TO YOUR [bleep] TAIL LIGHT!
[glass shatters]

06:35.796 --> 06:37.798
- [laughs]
- YEAH.

06:37.831 --> 06:38.999
WHAT THE [bleep] HAPPENED

06:39.032 --> 06:41.301
TO YOUR SIDE-VIEW MIRROR,
[bleep]?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.270
[glass shatters]
- [laughs]

06:43.303 --> 06:44.638
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR BLIND SPOT

06:44.672 --> 06:46.273
JUST GOT A LITTLE BIGGER,
[bleep]-WIT.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.141
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

06:48.175 --> 06:50.811
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

06:50.844 --> 06:53.747
YOU FORGOT ABOUT SOMETHING.

06:53.781 --> 06:58.586
OH, YOU FORGOT ONE MORE THING.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.589
HEY, YOU EVER BEEN
IN A SMASH-OFF?

07:01.622 --> 07:06.059
YOU ARE NOW.

07:06.093 --> 07:10.197
- SMASH-OFF!
[growls]

07:10.230 --> 07:12.099
- NO, NO,
MR. MACNEIL! NO!

07:12.132 --> 07:13.867
- [growls]
- NO, MR. MACNEIL!

07:13.901 --> 07:16.837
- [howls]

07:16.870 --> 07:20.941
- STOP, MR. MACNEIL!
THAT'S MY [bleep] CAR!

07:20.974 --> 07:22.375
- [howls]
- PLEASE, MR. MACNEIL!

07:22.409 --> 07:26.614
I--PLEASE!
- [grunts]

07:26.647 --> 07:28.582
- [bleep] STOP HITTING MY CAR!

07:28.616 --> 07:31.084
- [roars]

07:31.118 --> 07:32.385
- WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
- [bleep] YOU!

07:32.419 --> 07:34.688
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW,
[bleep]?

07:34.722 --> 07:36.624
- I WILL END YOU!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.091
- [bleep] [bleep],
GET IN THE CAR!

07:38.125 --> 07:39.560
- COME ON! COME ON!
- GET IN THE CAR NOW!

07:39.593 --> 07:41.895
OH, [bleep].
OH, [bleep].

07:41.929 --> 07:44.264
GET IN THE CAR!
- COME ON!

07:44.297 --> 07:46.767
- [bleep] [bleep]!
OH, [bleep]!

07:46.800 --> 07:47.768
- GET IN, GET IN, GET IN,
GET IN, GET IN!

07:47.801 --> 07:49.603
- [screams]

07:49.637 --> 07:52.405
- OH, [bleep].
GO! GO! GO!

07:52.439 --> 07:54.575
- WHAT IS HE DOING?
OH, GOD!

07:54.608 --> 07:56.443
OH, GOD, OH, GOD, OH, GOD!
- GO, GO, GO!

07:56.544 --> 07:57.978
- OH!
- OH, [bleep].

07:58.011 --> 07:59.547
- AS YOU CAN SEE,

07:59.580 --> 08:00.881
ROAD RAGE
IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE

08:00.914 --> 08:02.182
AND THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT

08:02.215 --> 08:03.350
IS GETTING THE [bleep]
OUT OF HERE!

08:03.383 --> 08:04.818
- MR. MACNEIL, HE'S BEHIND US!

08:04.852 --> 08:06.286
- WHAT IS HE DOING?
WHAT IS HE DOING?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.789
- HE'S GOING TO TRY TO RAM US.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.157
- OH!

08:10.190 --> 08:13.727
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU
WITH MY DICK!

08:13.761 --> 08:16.564
- OH, MY GOD.
[horn honks]

08:16.564 --> 08:18.165
- OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!

08:18.198 --> 08:20.200
- HE WENT OVER THE EDGE!

08:36.950 --> 08:39.753
- MY PRODUCER, GRANT,
IS ALWAYS ON HAND

08:39.787 --> 08:42.155
TO ASSIST WITH UNEXPECTED
COMPLICATIONS.

08:42.189 --> 08:46.594
IN THIS CASE, HIS INSIGHT
WAS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL.

08:46.627 --> 08:51.632
- HE TURNED AROUND...
AND WENT THAT WAY.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.620
I'M HAPPY TO DRIVE.
- OH, OKAY.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.021
- I'LL SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW.
- YEP, TOMORROW.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.023
- BYE, GRANT.

09:16.056 --> 09:20.527
- BUT IT APPEARS
THAT OTHER GENTLEMAN

09:20.628 --> 09:23.330
ALSO SAW THE FOLLY
OF ROAD RAGE

09:23.363 --> 09:25.933
AND, UH...

09:25.966 --> 09:30.303
YOU KNOW, TURNED AROUND...
AND WENT ON HOME,

09:30.337 --> 09:32.873
AND THAT IS DEFINITELY
WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND

09:32.906 --> 09:36.176
FOR SOMEONE WHO FEELS
ROAD RAGE COMING ON.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.211
- THANK GOD.
I-I THOUGHT HE DIED.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.814
BECAUSE THAT SCREECHING SOUND
AND THE TIRE TRACKS

09:40.848 --> 09:41.982
GOING RIGHT OFF THE CLIFF.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.117
- NO.
NO.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.119
NO.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.990
ROAD RAGE, 1 1/2 STARS.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.460
- OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES TO US

09:53.493 --> 09:57.130
FROM GARY
IN SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.833
- HEY, FORREST, UH, YOU KNOW
I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT MYSELF

09:59.867 --> 10:01.334
TO JUST ONE LADY.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.369
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO BANG

10:02.402 --> 10:05.005
A BUNCH OF THEM IN AN ORGY?

10:05.038 --> 10:06.840
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.676
OH, NO.
[laughter]

10:08.709 --> 10:12.179
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE GARY
WANTS ME TO GO TO AN ORGY.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.881
- IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.482
IF YOU GET NERVOUS,
JUST DO THAT THING

10:15.515 --> 10:18.518
WHERE YOU IMAGINE EVERYONE ELSE
IN THEIR UNDERWEAR.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.053
WAIT, DON'T DO THAT.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.822
BECAUSE THEN YOU'D
BE THE ONLY ONE NAKED.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.924
- YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO HELP.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.527
OKAY, I'M OFF TO GO HAVE SEX
WITH MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE...

10:27.560 --> 10:29.162
AT ONCE.
OH, BOY.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.398
WAS SENDING A CIVILIZED MAN INTO
AN ORGY

10:31.431 --> 10:33.834
LIKE RELEASING A ZOO MONKEY
INTO THE WILD?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.036
AND IF SO, WOULD HE SURVIVE?

10:36.069 --> 10:39.539
TO FIND OUT, THIS MONKEY WOULD
NEED TO FIND HIS SEX JUNGLE.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.375
THIS ONE'S LOCKED.
REALLY?

10:42.409 --> 10:45.679
WHAT'S THE OTHER WAY OUT?

10:45.713 --> 10:49.449
I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO LOCATE AN
ORGY, SO I CONSULTED WITH TOM,

10:49.482 --> 10:50.884
THE INTERVENTIONIST
WHO HELPED ME

10:50.918 --> 10:52.519
DURING MY REVIEW OF ADDICTION.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.922
HE, HIMSELF,
WAS A RECOVERING SEX ADDICT.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.757
HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOUR WIFE?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.625
ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING AGAIN OR WHAT?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.127
- UM, NO.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.330
I MEAN, I CAN'T SAY
I BLAME HER.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.432
I MEAN, I [bleep]
TWO OF HER SISTERS.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.434
I [bleep] HER BOSS.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.336
I CAME ON HER DOG.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.039
- YEAH, THAT ALL
SOUNDS PRETTY GROSS.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.007
- YEAH.
- HEY, THOUGH,

11:14.041 --> 11:18.545
I HAVE A SLIGHTLY AWKWARD THING
TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.647
- GO AHEAD.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.150
- OUT OF ALL OF THE ORGIES
THAT YOU USED TO GO TO...

11:23.183 --> 11:26.486
- MM-HMM?
- WHICH WOULD YOU SAY WAS, LIKE,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.221
THE BEST?

11:28.255 --> 11:31.892
- [chuckles]
OH, JEEZ, FORREST.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.327
IT'S--YOU NOW, IT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA FOR ME

11:34.361 --> 11:35.328
TO EVEN TALK ABOUT THAT.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.463
- RIGHT.
OKAY.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.131
YEAH, NO, I GET THAT.
- YEAH.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.666
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
COCAINE, BELIEVE ME.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.968
I DON'T WANT--
[chuckles]

11:41.001 --> 11:42.402
- RIGHT, I MEAN--

11:42.435 --> 11:43.503
- BUT I WOULD PROBABLY
TELL SOMEBODY

11:43.536 --> 11:45.505
WHERE THEY COULD GET COCAINE,

11:45.538 --> 11:46.974
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:47.007 --> 11:50.577
A TIME AND AN ADDRESS
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

11:50.610 --> 11:52.345
BUT, WITH A BIT
OF GENTLE PERSUASION,

11:52.379 --> 11:55.048
TOM TOLD ME ABOUT AN ORGY
THAT HE HAD ATTENDED REGULARLY

11:55.082 --> 11:58.085
DURING HIS YEARS AS
A COMPULSIVE HAVER OF SEX.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.788
HE DESCRIBED IT
AS EXCLUSIVE, ELABORATE,

12:00.788 --> 12:03.256
AND, IN A TURN OF PHRASE
I KNOW WILL HAUNT ME

12:03.290 --> 12:06.493
FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS,
"TOTALLY BALL DRAINING."

12:06.526 --> 12:09.262
"TOTALLY BALL DRAINING"?
- YES.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.632
TOTALLY BALL DRAINING.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.002
- FORREST?
- HMM?

12:15.035 --> 12:19.272
- WERE YOU EXPECTING A SCROLL,
A COCK RING, AND A FANCY MASK?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.241
- UH, YES.
YES, I WAS.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.242
IT'S...
[clears throat]

12:22.275 --> 12:24.444
FOR MY REVIEW, OF COURSE.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.316
- I USED TO WORK
FOR AN ACCOUNTANT.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.285
HE WAS A NICE MAN.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.321
- GIVE THIS PLEASE.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.662
THIS ORGY
IS A TOP SECRET PRIVATE AFFAIR.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.865
SO I'M GONNA LET
MY CAMERAMAN OUT HERE,

12:44.898 --> 12:46.967
AND I'M AFRAID YOU, DEAR VIEWER,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.937
WILL NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS
BY STEALING FURTIVE GLANCES

12:49.970 --> 12:52.472
THROUGH THE WINDOWS
LIKE A COMMON PERVERT.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.479
AS I ARRIVED
AT THE SEX MANSION,

12:59.512 --> 13:02.883
I WILL CONFESS
THAT I WAS TERRIFIED.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.518
IT HAD DAWNED ON ME
THAT PARTICIPANTS AT AN ORGY

13:05.552 --> 13:08.755
MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO KNOW
HOW TO FIND AND HANDLE

13:08.856 --> 13:10.523
CERTAIN PARTS OF A LADY.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.559
SCROLL HERE.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.870
I WAS IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTED
WITH DOZENS OF NAKED PEOPLE

13:22.903 --> 13:26.406
WRITHING AND THRUSTING IN WILD
PLEASURE ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.242
IT SEEMED TO ME
LIKE A VISION OF HELL.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.278
BUT THERE WAS NO
TURNING BACK NOW.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.885
[grunting and moaning]

13:37.885 --> 13:41.621
- DESPITE MY EXTREME DISCOMFORT
WITH CASUAL SEX,

13:41.654 --> 13:45.425
I WAS DETERMINED
TO GET INTO THE MIX.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.460
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR,
I CAME TO ACCEPT

13:47.494 --> 13:50.964
THAT I WOULD NEED
TO REMOVE MY CLOTHING.

13:50.998 --> 13:54.968
BUT EVEN THAT DID LITTLE
TO AROUSE ME OR ANYONE ELSE.

13:55.002 --> 13:59.372
THE IRONWORK
ON THIS STAIRCASE IS...

13:59.406 --> 14:01.909
REMARKABLE.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.911
HEY, LISTEN,
I THINK WE NEED TO DECIDE

14:03.911 --> 14:06.446
WHETHER THIS IS A SNACK TABLE
OR ANOTHER SEX SURFACE.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.416
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T
THINK IT CAN BE BOTH, YOU KNOW?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.919
YOU KNOW, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
THERE IS NO PLACE

14:11.919 --> 14:14.287
THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE
SETTING DOWN THESE SNACKS.

14:14.321 --> 14:18.425
IT SEEMED I WAS INCAPABLE
OF GETTING IN THE SPIRIT.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.929
BUT THEN I MET
THE KING OF THE ORGY.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.232
- THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME
AT AN ORGY, YES?

14:25.265 --> 14:28.801
- YOU KNOW--YES, ACTUALLY.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.203
THAT'S RIGHT, YES, TH--YEP.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.604
THIS IS MY FIRST ORGY.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.574
- YOU MUST EMBRACE
THE POWER OF THE MASK

14:34.607 --> 14:39.947
TO TRANSFORM YOU FROM WHOEVER
YOU ARE OUT THERE,

14:39.947 --> 14:44.817
INTO A GLORIOUS [bleep] BEAST

14:44.851 --> 14:48.221
WHO IS BORN
WHEN YOU WALK IN HERE,

14:48.255 --> 14:52.825
AND WHO DIES WHEN YOUR BALLS
ARE FULLY DRAINED.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.795
- THAT WAS THE ATTITUDE
ADJUSTMENT I'D NEEDED.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.764
I THINK I CAN DO THAT.
I CAN BE A [bleep] BEAST.

14:57.797 --> 15:01.368
I WAS FREED FROM FORREST
MACNEIL'S SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS

15:01.401 --> 15:04.671
AND HIS FEARS OF BEING PERFECTLY
AVERAGE IN THE PENIS DEPARTMENT.

15:04.704 --> 15:08.008
WHO WANTS TO HAVE SEX WITH ME?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.642
[shrill yelp]

15:09.676 --> 15:11.511
LET'S KEEP THIS FELLA-TIONSHIP

15:11.544 --> 15:13.313
STRICTLY BLOW-FESSIONAL.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.015
I'M ASKING FOR ORAL SEX.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.517
THE BARRIERS
I HAD PUT UP BETWEEN MYSELF

15:17.550 --> 15:20.320
AND WILD SEXUAL ABANDON
WERE WASHED AWAY

15:20.353 --> 15:22.489
IN A TIDAL WAVE OF PLEASURE.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.157
AND I HAVE TO SAY,

15:24.191 --> 15:26.226
IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST
[bleep] NIGHTS OF MY LIFE.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.996
I'M A [bleep] BEAST!

15:31.564 --> 15:35.035
BUT MY NIGHT AT THE MANSION
HAD CHANGED ME.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.673
TOM...HEY.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.342
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- GOOD.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.776
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. REAL GOOD.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.379
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, GOOD. DOING WELL.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.849
- SO, UH,
THE THING WORKED OUT FRIDAY?

15:49.882 --> 15:53.686
- OH, MY, YES, IT DID.
- OH, YEAH?

15:53.720 --> 15:57.024
- I JUST WANT TO SAY, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR THE HOOKUP THERE.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.358
OH, MY GOD.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.127
THAT WAS AN UNFORGETTABLE
EXPERIENCE.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.030
EVERYWHERE I LOOKED THERE WERE
THESE BIG BEAUTIFUL BREASTS

16:03.030 --> 16:04.931
WITH PERT, PINK LITTLE NIPPLES

16:05.032 --> 16:08.201
AND FIRM, PULCHRITUDINOUS
BUTTOCKS

16:08.235 --> 16:11.038
AND SOFT, INVITING LABIA MAJORA.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.039
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:12.039 --> 16:14.841
CAN WE--CAN WE CHANGE THE TOPIC?

16:14.874 --> 16:17.310
- YEAH.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT

16:17.344 --> 16:18.378
SOMETHING ELSE.
- OF COURSE.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.379
I'M SO SORRY.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.713
- NO, NO, DON'T BE.

16:20.747 --> 16:21.714
- YES. OH, NO.
- DON'T BE.

16:21.748 --> 16:22.715
I BROUGHT IT UP.

16:22.749 --> 16:23.716
- YEAH, YOU DID BRING IT UP.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.052
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.053
- ANYWAY, REMEMBER
THAT COOKING CLASS

16:26.086 --> 16:27.487
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.056
- YES.
- YEAH.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.958
WELL, LAST NIGHT THEY TAUGHT US
HOW TO MAKE PAELLA.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.326
IT'S REALLY COOL, ACTUALLY.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.827
YOU NEED A SPECIAL PAN TO--

16:34.861 --> 16:36.229
- HOW'D YOU LIKE
TO BURY YOUR FACE IN THAT?

16:36.263 --> 16:39.566
MMM.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.635
OHH.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.139
- NEXT WEEK, THEY'RE GONNA
TEACH US HOW TO MAKE BRISKET.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.875
- WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:48.908 --> 16:51.478
FRIDAY NIGHT COULDN'T ARRIVE
FAST ENOUGH.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.213
AFTER A WEEK WITHOUT SEX,

16:53.246 --> 16:55.848
MY LOINS WERE LIKE A THIRSTY
SPICE MERCHANT,

16:55.882 --> 16:59.986
STRANDED IN THE DESERT AND THESE
WOMEN'S VAGINAS WERE THE WATER.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.389
THAT NIGHT I WOULD DRINK DEEPLY.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.324
MY TONGUE EXPLORED.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.093
MY FINGERS PROBED.

17:06.126 --> 17:10.230
MY SWOLLEN AVERAGE-SIZED MEMBER
BECAME A HAMMER OF THE GODS.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.633
NO FEAR, NO REGRET, NO GUILT.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.468
AND THEN THERE WAS SOME GUILT.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.670
- OH, MY GOD.
- OH, NO.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.240
- [moans]
- OH, NO.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.275
HEY. HEY!
TOM!

17:22.309 --> 17:24.677
- OH, YOU.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.446
- YOU KNOW, JOYLESSLY
AND COMPULSIVELY

17:26.479 --> 17:28.115
[bleep] EVERYTHING I CAN.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.183
- TOM, NO.
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.818
TOM, YOU'RE A SEX ADDICT.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.120
THIS IS A RELAPSE.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.154
YOU HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE, NOW.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.456
- SIR, IS THERE A PROBLEM?

17:36.489 --> 17:37.824
- YES, THERE IS A PROBLEM.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.492
HE DOESN'T BELONG HERE!

17:39.526 --> 17:40.793
[gasping]

17:40.827 --> 17:42.629
- YOU ARE MISTAKEN, SIR.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.831
WE ALL BELONG HERE.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.334
YET, CLEARLY A DISPUTE EXISTS.

17:47.367 --> 17:52.872
THEREFORE,
I DECLARE A [bleep]-OFF!

17:52.905 --> 17:55.442
[cheers and applause]

17:55.475 --> 17:57.877
all: IN, OUT, IN, OUT, IN, OUT!
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

17:57.910 --> 18:00.046
WHAT IS A [bleep]-OFF?

18:00.147 --> 18:02.014
- IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.452
EACH OF YOU WILL ASSEMBLE
A FIVE-PERSON [bleep] SQUAD.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.887
YOU WILL [bleep]
THE PEOPLE YOU CHOOSE

18:07.920 --> 18:10.790
UNTIL ONE OF YOU
CAN'T [bleep] ANYMORE.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.894
THE LOSER HAS TO LEAVE
MY HOUSE FOREVER,

18:14.927 --> 18:18.598
AND THE WINNER
IS THE KING OF THE ORGY.

18:18.631 --> 18:23.236
[cheers and applause]

18:23.270 --> 18:25.638
- YOU PEOPLE ARE INSANE.
all: IN, OUT, IN, OUT, IN, OUT!

18:25.672 --> 18:28.941
- I'D SAVE THAT ENERGY
FOR THE [bleep]-OFF.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.416
- MY [bleep] BEAST
HAD CREATED A HORRIBLE PROBLEM,

18:36.449 --> 18:38.585
AND APPARENTLY WOULD HAVE
TO SOLVE IT TOO.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.988
IF I WANTED TOM OUT, I WAS GOING
TO HAVE TO [bleep] HIM OUT.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.490
WOULD YOU WANT
TO BE ON MY TEAM?

18:43.523 --> 18:46.259
OKAY.
I'M SORRY.

18:46.293 --> 18:50.197
- [speaks French]

18:50.197 --> 18:52.665
- SEX FEELS GOOD,
AND THIS WAS SEX,

18:52.699 --> 18:54.867
BUT THE COMPETITION
WAS TURNING NASTY.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.936
- YOU PICKED
TOO MANY HOTTIES, BUDDY.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.272
YOU GOT TO PICK CAMELS,
NOT RACEHORSES.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.707
- HEY!

19:00.740 --> 19:02.575
- JUST MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
OVER THERE.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.878
YOU PICK ONE WHO LOOKS LIKE
YOUR EX-WIFE ON PURPOSE?

19:05.912 --> 19:07.414
- SHUT UP.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.081
- SHE DOES LOOK JUST LIKE HER,
DOESN'T SHE?

19:09.115 --> 19:11.584
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN
COOKING CLASS TONIGHT, TOM, HUH?

19:11.618 --> 19:13.686
AS I ROTATED THROUGH
MY [bleep] SQUAD,

19:13.720 --> 19:16.055
I REALIZED THAT I WAS NO BEAST.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.291
I WAS JUST A MAN
AND I HAD HAD ENOUGH

19:18.325 --> 19:23.263
OF THIS AWESOME PLEASURE HILL.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.098
BUT I COULDN'T LEAVE
POOR TOM HERE.

19:26.132 --> 19:29.636
NO.
I WOULD WIN THIS [bleep]-OFF.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.573
AND FINALLY, NEARLY 30 GLORIOUS
MINUTES OF UNINTERRUPTED HUMPING

19:33.606 --> 19:36.276
PROVED TO BE TOO MUCH FOR
TOM'S WEARY [bleep] MUSCLES.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.711
- OW, CRAMP, CRAMP, CRAMP!
- YEAH!

19:38.745 --> 19:40.780
[cheers and applause]

19:40.813 --> 19:42.249
OR HAD TOM'S GUARDIAN ANGEL

19:42.282 --> 19:44.384
TAKEN THE FORM OF ME
WITHOUT MY UNDERWEAR?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.419
WHO KNOWS?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.825
- BRAVO.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.595
- THANK YOU.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.265
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
TO MY [bleep] SQUAD.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.268
I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU GUYS.

20:01.268 --> 20:06.138
AS YOUR NEW KING, I HEREBY
DECREE THAT THE SEX BETWEEN US

20:06.172 --> 20:09.242
WILL NO LONGER BE ANONYMOUS.

20:09.276 --> 20:12.245
LET'S TAKE OFF THESE MASKS,
YOU GUYS.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.681
WE DON'T NEED 'EM.
- HE'S HIDEOUS.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.449
- COME ON.
WHO KNOWS?

20:16.483 --> 20:18.618
MAYBE SOME OF US WILL FIND
REAL LOVE HERE,

20:18.651 --> 20:20.420
INSTEAD OF JUST SEX.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.788
[distant moaning]

20:21.821 --> 20:23.823
[door slams]

20:26.293 --> 20:30.029
- HEY, OUR FRIENDSHIP IS OFF,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.599
BECAUSE YOU'RE A JERK!

20:32.632 --> 20:35.034
SCREW YOU, FORREST MACNEIL!

20:35.067 --> 20:39.672
- OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.107
- FIRST OF ALL, GROSS.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.375
AND SECOND OF ALL,

20:42.409 --> 20:44.777
WHAT DID YOU TAKE AWAY
FROM THAT ORGY?

20:44.811 --> 20:47.614
- TWO THINGS: A DRUG-RESISTANT
FORM OF GONORRHEA

20:47.647 --> 20:49.282
AND AN IMPORTANT REALIZATION.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.484
YOU SEE, I WAS DELIGHTED
BY THE VARIETY

20:51.518 --> 20:53.185
AND THE ABUNDANCE OF SEX THERE,

20:53.219 --> 20:55.322
BUT BY THE END OF MY TIME
AS A SWINGER,

20:55.355 --> 20:57.357
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT FELT MORE EMPTY.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.727
MY HEART, MY SOUL, OR MY BALLS?

21:00.760 --> 21:04.931
GOING TO AN ORGY, TWO STARS.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.509
[dramatic music]

21:16.543 --> 21:19.145
*

21:19.178 --> 21:20.780
[aerosol can hisses]

21:20.813 --> 21:23.783
[muffled moaning]

21:23.816 --> 21:25.818
[aerosol can hisses]
