WEBVTT

01:16.333 --> 01:18.333
Oh, for me?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.125
- Out of my way.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.541
-Move!

01:29.375 --> 01:30.625
- Wicked witch!

01:32.875 --> 01:34.583
- Oh, hey.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.333
-Oh!

01:38.625 --> 01:40.458
Well, that was enough for me today.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.833
-Look, there!

01:42.916 --> 01:44.208
How dare thee!

01:44.291 --> 01:46.708
Oh, Winifred Sanderson.

01:52.416 --> 01:53.500
-Surprise.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.500
This is the worst day of my life.

01:57.583 --> 01:58.583
- Uh-oh.

01:59.791 --> 02:02.708
But, Winnie, look what we have made.

02:02.791 --> 02:06.750
I discovered if thou doth
grind pig's hooves and mix it with water,

02:06.833 --> 02:09.416
it creates mysterious goo.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.625
Then Mary had the wonderful idea
to mix a drop of goat's blood.

02:13.708 --> 02:16.541
And look. It jiggleth. Here.

02:16.625 --> 02:17.916
- Taste this, Winnie.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.041
'Tis divine!

02:20.125 --> 02:23.208
-I cannot eat. I am too troubled.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.166
Didst the Turner boys lock thee
in the hay barrack again?

02:25.250 --> 02:26.333
Worse.

02:26.416 --> 02:28.958
I've been told I'm getting... old,

02:29.041 --> 02:30.083
and I must marry...

02:30.166 --> 02:31.583
-...John Pritchett.

02:32.791 --> 02:34.250
Reverend Traske arranged it.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.875
He said it was his duty since father died.

02:36.958 --> 02:39.458
-Didst thee say no?
-Of course.

02:39.541 --> 02:42.875
Then I took the Lord's name in vain twice.

02:42.958 --> 02:45.541
Thou art most wicked, Winnie.

02:45.625 --> 02:49.000
Only a truly wretched man
can make me say such things.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.333
It was my favorite plate.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.083
There, there, there, Winnie.

02:55.166 --> 02:58.750
Let us forget the Reverend
and John Pritchett.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.458
Wouldst thee like to open thy presents?

03:02.541 --> 03:03.875
Mm.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.958
-You will love it.

03:08.875 --> 03:11.291
We searched for the largest one
we could find.

03:14.875 --> 03:17.666
-It is adorable.
-What shall we name it?

03:19.041 --> 03:20.416
It is the Reverend.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.583
Hide. Act as if we're not here.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.750
-- Open the door.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.166
We are not here.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.166
Yes?

03:38.250 --> 03:40.666
-- Wretched soul!
-- Look at her!

03:40.750 --> 03:42.500
- Winifred Sanderson.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.958
I will mercifully give thee
one more chance. Oh!

03:50.458 --> 03:57.291
Atone for thy disgusting words
and agree to marry John Pritchett.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.791
-Allow me a moment to reconsider.
-Yes, of course.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.583
-Mm, yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

04:06.666 --> 04:08.833
-No.
-Oh, praise God.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.041
-- Oh, God.
-What's he said?

04:11.125 --> 04:13.166
-- Blasphemy!
-I apologize, Reverend.

04:13.250 --> 04:16.500
It is only she is so ugly and unpleasant.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.541
-I concur.
-And thou art some prize?

04:18.625 --> 04:19.916
- Teeth of the devil!

04:20.000 --> 04:22.750
Oh, it is true, he is quite odd.
But how dare thou sayeth so.

04:22.833 --> 04:25.083
She cannot speak that way to a man.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.416
I refuse to marry that lout.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.625
If I shall marry anyone,
it will be Billy Butcherson.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Oh, Billy?

04:32.083 --> 04:34.250
-What? Why me?
-Who?

04:34.458 --> 04:35.541
Because we are soul mates.

04:35.625 --> 04:36.625
-Since when?
-What?

04:36.708 --> 04:38.416
Since we shared that kiss
in the graveyard.

04:39.750 --> 04:40.708
Oh, my God.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.916
She relishes in her petulance.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.041
Correct. Goodbye.

04:48.583 --> 04:52.416
Thou has defied
the authority of the Church.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.250
If thou doth wish
to continue in such flagrant

04:55.333 --> 04:58.083
disregard of all that we hold sacrosanct,

04:58.458 --> 05:00.500
thou shall not do it here.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.916
A rotten apple quickly infects
its neighbor.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
And we want no more like thee.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.250
-I banish thee from Salem.

05:12.916 --> 05:14.000
Forever.

05:15.708 --> 05:17.541
-Take the girls.
-What?

05:17.625 --> 05:20.458
-No, no. no.
-No, no.

05:20.541 --> 05:23.458
- You can't do that.
Take your hands off my sisters.

05:23.541 --> 05:25.333
-- No! Stop it!

05:25.416 --> 05:26.833
But this is our home.

05:26.916 --> 05:29.208
Oh, not anymore.

05:29.291 --> 05:32.833
The kind Smiths have agreed
to take thy sisters

05:32.916 --> 05:35.500
and turn them right!

05:37.041 --> 05:39.500
-Stop! Thou cannot take my sisters!
-No! Stop!

05:39.583 --> 05:40.833
-- No.
-No. No.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.458
Winnie, please!

05:42.541 --> 05:44.541
-Unhand me now.
-- Thou must have faith.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.166
-Thou must have faith.
-No!

05:46.250 --> 05:48.125
-No!
-This is for...

05:53.125 --> 05:54.750
My good God.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.666
-Oh, my God.
-Look at it!

05:57.500 --> 05:59.458
-The Reverend.
-- No, it's Satan's hand.

05:59.541 --> 06:02.208
-Reverend, are you all right?
-I'm not all right.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.500
She tried to kill the Reverend.

06:03.583 --> 06:05.791
-Winnie, Winnie.
-Oh, Winnie. Winnie.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.541
Quick. To the forbidden wood.

06:08.625 --> 06:11.375
-But it's forbidden.
-So they will not follow. Go!

06:11.458 --> 06:13.291
With thy eight legs of sin!

06:13.375 --> 06:15.750
-- It was on me!
-- They are wicked! All of them!

06:15.833 --> 06:17.541
Find it!

06:17.625 --> 06:18.750
Don't toucheth me!

06:30.250 --> 06:31.541
- Keep up.

06:33.416 --> 06:34.833
Stay close.

06:42.666 --> 06:45.291
-- Where are we?
-- I do not know.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.958
I've never been this deep
into the woods before.

06:48.791 --> 06:50.958
I do not like this place.

06:52.916 --> 06:56.375
Perhaps we should form a calming circle.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.125
All right.

07:05.416 --> 07:07.791
- Think soothing thoughts.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.750
The smell of fresh mud.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.333
The Reverend's scream
when he saw the spider.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.583
- The soothing of thoughts.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.333
- What was that?

07:30.166 --> 07:35.666
- ♪ Come little children
I'll take thee away ♪

07:36.333 --> 07:42.541
♪ Into a land of enchantment ♪

07:42.625 --> 07:43.791
No, Sarah!

08:01.375 --> 08:02.750
-No! Stop!

08:05.250 --> 08:08.500
-Thou looketh thirsty, child.
-Let her go!

08:16.416 --> 08:19.416
-Why didst thou come into my woods?
-We had no choice.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.250
They were gonna take my sisters.

08:21.333 --> 08:25.083
Thou art different from the other children
I have eat...

08:26.791 --> 08:28.000
Met.

08:28.666 --> 08:31.000
They feared thou wouldst corrupt them.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.250
New World. Same story.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.833
But they were right to fear thee.

08:37.916 --> 08:40.083
Thy temper.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.541
I do not have a temper.

08:43.583 --> 08:44.583
Thy...

08:49.708 --> 08:51.291
power.

08:52.125 --> 08:55.750
Dost thou know why
the commoners fear these woods?

08:56.458 --> 09:01.750
-This is a very sacred space for witches.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.708
We come here to charge our magic.

09:06.541 --> 09:08.791
To make us stronger.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.291
More powerful.

09:12.833 --> 09:18.833
This altar is what makes Salem
so very special.

09:18.916 --> 09:19.958
- Special?

09:20.041 --> 09:24.000
-Salem is dreadful.
-Only because it is run by fools!

09:24.875 --> 09:29.291
But one day Salem will belong to us.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.208
Us?

09:43.291 --> 09:46.375
Magic has a way of uniting things
that ought to be together.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.916
Happy 16th birthday, child.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.541
-But...
-I'm a witch. I know things.

09:54.625 --> 09:55.833
-Go on.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.833
Cat Transformation. Levitation Spell.

10:07.916 --> 10:11.041
'Tis an apothecary book.
Like one of Father's.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.791
No, 'tis a spell book.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.500
- Magicae Maxima.
The Power Spell.

10:18.708 --> 10:19.875
Oh, let's do this one.

10:22.250 --> 10:25.666
Magicae Maxima makes a witch all-powerful.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.583
It is most frowned upon.

10:27.666 --> 10:30.041
Doomed is the witch that uses this spell.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.833
Promise thou shalt never do it.

10:32.916 --> 10:33.875
Why?

10:35.750 --> 10:37.916
Because I said so.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.041
Besides, Book does not like it.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.416
Do not worry, Mister Book.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.625
I shall not do that spell, I promise.

10:47.708 --> 10:48.666
But what of the cat one?

10:48.750 --> 10:51.083
That would be good to do
to John Pritchett.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.541
Thou art lucky to have each other.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.708
A witch is nothing without her coven.

10:59.916 --> 11:03.166
-Where is thy coven?
-Long gone I'm afraid.

11:04.541 --> 11:07.208
The world is not too fond of witches.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.708
Can't imagine why.

11:10.375 --> 11:13.833
Perhaps because thou eateth the children?

11:15.208 --> 11:19.125
How else does one stay young
and ridiculously beautiful?

11:20.500 --> 11:22.041
How can I ever thank thee?

11:23.416 --> 11:26.708
She turned into leaves.

11:26.791 --> 11:28.208
What will we do with it, Winnie?

11:33.291 --> 11:34.125
- Keep up!

11:34.208 --> 11:37.625
Okay, Mister Book,
shall we get some revenge?

11:43.250 --> 11:45.333
-
"The Spell of Smoke and Flame."

11:46.208 --> 11:49.166
"Upon thy house so full of lies..."

11:49.250 --> 11:52.666
-"Ichita copita melaka mystica."

11:52.750 --> 11:56.166
"Bring my wrath, may fire rise!"

11:59.833 --> 12:02.416
-It worked. It worked.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.708
- Oh, my God.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.041
Fire! Wake up!

12:12.125 --> 12:13.708
Wake up!

12:13.791 --> 12:15.791
Now they shall never take us.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.500
- Now we'll be together forever.

12:17.583 --> 12:21.166
This is Satan's work! Hurry!
Throw the water!

12:21.250 --> 12:24.125
Oh, this is the work of the spider!

12:25.166 --> 12:26.458
- Can you feel it?

12:26.541 --> 12:30.666
It's all around us. It's evil. It's evil!

Happy birthday.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.208
-Did I get you?
-Yeah, you, you got me.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.458
Oh, so my mom is, of course,
thrilled you're sleeping over tonight.

13:36.541 --> 13:39.500
-Well, Susan loves an event.
-Yes, she really does.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.583
Oh, incoming.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.791
-Hey. Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.458
Uh...

13:51.041 --> 13:52.250
So what are you guys doing tonight?

13:55.541 --> 13:59.625
Birthday rituals, scary movie marathon.
Same as every year, you know?

14:00.208 --> 14:01.041
Yeah.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.333
Hey, babe. Sorry, I'm late.

14:04.416 --> 14:06.208
I decided to have two breakfasts.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.625
Oh, and you got to come
check out Brian's car.

14:08.708 --> 14:11.041
We covered the entire thing in tinfoil.

14:11.666 --> 14:12.958
Why?

14:13.041 --> 14:14.583
Because it's funny.

14:14.666 --> 14:16.875
Mike, come on, let's go.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.208
-Come on.
-- See you.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.458
Well, that's a start, right?

14:22.541 --> 14:25.041
Why would she ask about our plans?
She knows what we're doing.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.416
Maybe she was hoping you'd invite her?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.458
Izz, if she wanted to hang out
with us on my birthday,

14:29.541 --> 14:33.125
she'd probably have hung out with us
one other time in the last four months.

14:33.208 --> 14:36.250
I know, but still, it's our tradition.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.833
Yeah, maybe.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.500
What do you need good luck for?

14:50.583 --> 14:52.875
-Ten bucks says we have a pop quiz today.
-Ooh.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.416
Hey, Cassie?

15:03.291 --> 15:08.000
-About tonight, I was--
-Dude, it's gonna be awesome.

15:08.791 --> 15:10.625
-What is?
-Our party.

15:10.708 --> 15:13.083
At Cassie's. You're coming, right?

15:13.166 --> 15:14.333
We invited the whole grade.

15:14.416 --> 15:15.750
Even Glenn.

15:15.833 --> 15:16.958
Yo, Glenn.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.250
-Glenn.
-What?

15:19.833 --> 15:22.666
-That's so Glenn.
-You're throwing a party tonight?

15:22.750 --> 15:24.208
How is that even possible?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.458
Your dad would never let you do that.

15:26.541 --> 15:27.625
It was my idea.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.583
I told you I wanted to talk
to them about it first.

15:29.666 --> 15:31.250
Oh, do you guys want to talk now?

15:31.333 --> 15:33.375
No, it's fine.
We don't have anything to talk about.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.000
-Have fun at your party.
-Becca, come on.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.833
Are you guys gone
a be busy doing witchery?

15:40.250 --> 15:43.083
What? The three of you
used to do witch stuff every Halloween.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.125
-It's not witch stuff.
-Then what's that?

15:45.875 --> 15:47.583
A good luck charm
in case there's a pop quiz.

15:47.666 --> 15:51.708
Well, I hope not,
because I didn't do the reading.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.041
MR.-
Good morning, ghouls and goblins.

15:56.125 --> 15:59.333
In honor of Halloween,
I've prepared the scariest class possible.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.375
-- Is he a banana?
-A pop quiz.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.583
- Of course.

16:04.666 --> 16:06.250
You knew that was gonna happen.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.041
Mr. Wilke's a jerk.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.875
Of course, he'd give us
a pop quiz on Halloween.

16:09.958 --> 16:10.791
I made an inference.

16:11.291 --> 16:15.500
-Is that a spell?
-MR.- Okay. Let's begin.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.416
Focus.

16:23.625 --> 16:27.375
Tempeh, soyrizo, aquafaba, garbanzo,

16:27.458 --> 16:30.166
cacao, spirulina, crimini, seitan!

16:30.250 --> 16:31.583
What did you do?

16:31.666 --> 16:33.333
-Everyone settle down.

16:33.416 --> 16:35.708
-- Here's your quiz.
-She was muttering some weird,

16:35.791 --> 16:37.375
scary language, right, babe?

16:37.458 --> 16:38.500
You heard it.

16:38.583 --> 16:39.708
I...

16:40.208 --> 16:42.666
It did sound like you said "Satan."

16:42.750 --> 16:45.333
I said "seitan."
I was literally listing vegan food.

16:45.416 --> 16:46.791
See. She admits it.

16:46.875 --> 16:50.166
That's enough.
Mike, Becca, Principal's office. Now.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.958
-- Busted!

16:53.000 --> 16:54.583
-- Great.
-MR.- Quiet down.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.041
Making sure Mike doesn't get lost?

17:18.875 --> 17:21.208
Look, your dad is going
to find out about your party.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.875
And when he does, you're gonna be grounded

17:22.958 --> 17:25.041
until at least college.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.708
Why do you care? You're not even coming.

17:27.583 --> 17:31.125
I'm not coming because we just heard
about it from Mike.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.541
As if that would have made any difference.

17:33.625 --> 17:35.416
Hey, you finished your test pretty fast.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.500
Can't believe you guys
are still doing the birthday ritual.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.041
We started doing that, what,
when we were, like, 5?

17:42.833 --> 17:44.083
We get it, Cassie.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.375
You're too cool for it now.

17:45.458 --> 17:46.416
- Guys, come on.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.250
Saturday detention.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.166
Thanks a lot.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.875
Principal's ready to see you now, Becca.

17:56.916 --> 17:58.583
- Yeah, I can't wait.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.541
-I know, right? Let's go.
-Like what?

18:17.583 --> 18:20.375
- This carnival gets crazier
and crazier every year.

18:21.416 --> 18:22.500
- Oh, wow.

18:22.583 --> 18:25.166
Cassie made it on the billboard this time.

18:25.250 --> 18:26.916
Huh.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.833
You know, Cassie's family dates back
to the witch trials.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.583
Must be why this is Mr. Traske's
favorite holiday.

18:33.666 --> 18:35.958
- He did a great job
with the decorations.

18:36.041 --> 18:36.875
-Looks pretty good.
-Becca?

18:36.958 --> 18:37.791
-Kinda...
-Izzy?

18:38.416 --> 18:39.458
Hey.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.708
-Mr. Traske. How's it going?
-Hey.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.250
-How are you?

18:43.333 --> 18:45.250
♪ Someone's got a birthday ♪

18:45.333 --> 18:46.750
♪ Someone's got a birthday ♪

18:46.833 --> 18:47.666
Right?

18:47.750 --> 18:49.666
-- Yes.
-Are you heading to your sacred circle?

18:49.750 --> 18:51.333
We actually don't call it
the sacred circle anymore.

18:51.416 --> 18:54.250
-Felt, felt a little bit dramatic.
-Oh, that's a bummer.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.208
Oh, my gosh.

18:55.291 --> 18:58.583
Remember when Cassie would bring,
like, 10 flashlights with us?

18:58.666 --> 18:59.541
Right.

19:04.416 --> 19:06.583
Ten.

19:08.041 --> 19:09.208
Did you say 10?

19:09.291 --> 19:10.833
-Yeah, it's really funny.
-Yeah.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.291
Oh, that's good.

19:14.375 --> 19:16.250
Oh, she's the best.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.250
Oh, where is Cassie?

19:18.333 --> 19:20.416
Uh, uh... Well...

19:20.500 --> 19:22.125
She, um... She's running late.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.458
-She had a...
-Oh.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.666
-A mascara crisis.
-Right.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.250
Mascara? Is everything okay?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.958
-Oh, no, she'll be fine.
-Okay.

19:31.083 --> 19:31.916
Oh, listen, are you going

19:32.000 --> 19:32.875
-to the magic shop?
-Yeah.

19:32.958 --> 19:35.291
Can you pass out some of these
campaign flyers for me?

19:35.375 --> 19:36.958
-I would really appreciate it.
-Sure. Yeah.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.666
I'm gonna see you at the festival tonight.
Look at this.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.666
Am I gone a see you here?

19:39.750 --> 19:41.541
Yeah? Okay. It's gonna be a good one.

19:41.625 --> 19:42.666
Can you guess why?

19:42.750 --> 19:44.416
Guess who's coming back from Boston.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.666
Sandy's Candy Cauldron.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.625
What?

19:51.833 --> 19:53.041
You don't remember Sandy's Candy Cauldron?

19:53.125 --> 19:55.541
Oh, come on. She was the best.

19:55.625 --> 19:58.333
And then she got so busy because
she went on something called GMA,

19:58.416 --> 20:00.041
which is like some acronym
for fancy people.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.291
-I don't really get it, but, you know.
-Good Morning America?

20:02.375 --> 20:04.208
But I got her to come back.

20:04.291 --> 20:07.333
And listen. You have to have
one of her caramel apples.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.375
It will... It'll change your life.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.708
Promise me?

20:10.791 --> 20:11.958
-Totally.
-Yeah, absolutely.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.125
Good. Oh, would you mind
just taking the rest of these?

20:14.208 --> 20:15.166
-Sure. Of course.
-Thanks, guys.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.500
All right. Later, Mr. Traske.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.625
-See you guys later.
-See you.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.125
-He really is the nicest man alive.
-I know.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.833
It's kind of sad he doesn't realize
Cassie kicked us to the curb.

20:26.708 --> 20:29.583
- People of Salem, gather round.

20:29.666 --> 20:33.458
I am Gilbert the Great,

20:34.583 --> 20:37.250
here to terrify and amaze you

20:37.333 --> 20:41.708
with the most bone-chilling legend
of All Hallow's Eve.

20:42.125 --> 20:45.166
That of the Sanderson Sisters.

20:48.083 --> 20:52.541
The Sanderson Sisters
were the most powerful coven

20:52.666 --> 20:53.875
that ever lived,

20:53.958 --> 20:56.750
thanks to Winifred's book of spells.

20:59.541 --> 21:02.208
You really don't want people
opening that book, huh?

21:02.291 --> 21:04.916
That's not to keep people from getting in.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.833
No, it's to keep the book
from getting out.

21:12.875 --> 21:13.916
-WOMAN Oh.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.875
That very book contains
the recipe to the potion

21:17.958 --> 21:20.791
the sisters used to kill Emily Binx

21:20.875 --> 21:24.833
on Halloween night, 1693.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.750
In that same night,
the three witches hanged.

21:28.833 --> 21:31.791
But not before they cast the curse!

21:31.875 --> 21:35.125
Ah! Fools. All of you.

21:35.541 --> 21:40.666
That if a virgin should light the Black
Flame Candle on All Hallow's Eve

21:40.750 --> 21:43.208
with a full moon in the sky,

21:43.750 --> 21:46.666
the Sanderson Sisters vowed
they would one day return

21:46.750 --> 21:49.375
to take revenge on all of Salem.

21:50.541 --> 21:51.958
What's a virgin?

21:53.625 --> 21:59.125
Uh, that is a... a person who has never...

21:59.958 --> 22:01.833
-lit a candle.

22:01.916 --> 22:04.833
But perhaps the sisters
have already returned.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.750
Twenty-nine years ago, on Halloween night,

22:09.250 --> 22:14.416
some swear they saw three figures fly
across the moon.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.000
Sounds like someone
had a little too much candy.

22:17.083 --> 22:22.125
-Well, then, how do you explain this?

22:22.208 --> 22:26.666
Behold, the Black Flame Candle
burned to the wick.

22:26.750 --> 22:30.333
Oh, so the witches have been walking
among us for 29 years.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.458
-Look out, everybody.
-No, man.

22:32.666 --> 22:35.833
The candle's magic only brings
them back for one night.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.875
They disappear at sunrise. Okay?

22:37.958 --> 22:40.875
Just, can I finish this?

22:40.958 --> 22:42.125
Thank you.

22:42.666 --> 22:45.291
But if the candle's melted,
then no one can light it

22:45.375 --> 22:46.583
and they can't come back.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.541
-- Right?
-You are right.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.458
-They cannot return.
-Mm-hm.

22:51.541 --> 22:55.625
That is unless there is another candle.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.416
Witches are real. We're all gonna die.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.083
And if you two would like
to try your hand

23:02.166 --> 23:03.958
at resurrecting the Sanderson Sisters,

23:04.041 --> 23:06.375
Black Flame candles
are half off for Halloween.

23:13.833 --> 23:14.875
-So.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.750
What can I get for my favorite customers?

23:16.833 --> 23:17.833
-- Uh...

23:17.916 --> 23:19.458
-Just this.
-- What? That's it?

23:19.541 --> 23:20.958
But it's your birthday.

23:21.041 --> 23:24.375
You can't just come in here
for one crystal like it's any old Tuesday.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.375
You know, legend has it,

23:26.458 --> 23:28.875
it's on the 16th birthday
that a witch gets her powers.

23:28.958 --> 23:31.125
And like most legends,
I'm assuming that's based on

23:31.208 --> 23:33.125
some sort of patriarchal fear
of female aging.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.041
Yeah, probably that too.

23:35.125 --> 23:37.000
But either way,

23:37.583 --> 23:40.500
-I have a gift for your empowerment.
-Ooh.

23:40.875 --> 23:42.666
- Just the thing
for a young mystic.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.750
-Ew.

23:47.708 --> 23:51.791
-It looks like it drowned.
-Well, looks aren't everything.

23:51.875 --> 23:56.333
Besides, I charged that candle
with a very powerful magic just for you.

23:56.416 --> 23:57.958
It's perfect for your birthday ritual.

23:58.041 --> 23:59.541
It's on the house.

23:59.625 --> 24:00.833
And speaking of trollies...

24:01.500 --> 24:04.625
You know, if you're looking to kill
some time before your birthday plans...

24:04.708 --> 24:05.916
We're not doing the ghost tour.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.333
-Oh, well...
-I'm sorry.

24:07.416 --> 24:09.208
It's just we basically know it by heart.

24:09.291 --> 24:12.000
Ooh. Free stuff. What are these?

24:12.083 --> 24:14.833
Angelica leaves.
You burn them to lift curses.

24:14.916 --> 24:16.333
You should take some.

24:17.083 --> 24:20.125
For you never know
when you may be cursed on Halloween.

24:22.375 --> 24:23.375
-Hey.
-- Take it off.

24:23.458 --> 24:25.708
-You don't taunt the Devil Book.
-- Stop. Stop, Amanda.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.708
- You know,
I still don't get why you chose

24:30.791 --> 24:32.791
the creepiest part of the woods
to have a ritual.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.416
- I just kind of feel drawn to it.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.958
And besides, it's nice to be
in the comfort of nature.

24:37.041 --> 24:39.458
- The park behind my house
has great nature too.

24:40.041 --> 24:42.166
But you know who did? Glenn.

24:42.250 --> 24:44.583
-- He is a phenomenal dancer.
-- Phenomenal dancer.

24:44.666 --> 24:46.666
- Yes, exactly.
It's really, really beautiful.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.166
-Uh-huh.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.083
My mom is shopping
for snacks for the movie marathon,

24:51.166 --> 24:53.458
and she keeps sending
me blurry pictures of cookies.

24:53.541 --> 24:54.916
She's just trying to help.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.416
I know, but it's just, like,

24:56.500 --> 24:59.083
-"Buy the cookies, Susan. Who cares?"

25:07.916 --> 25:09.208
What?

25:09.291 --> 25:11.166
Felt like we needed her here with us.

25:23.666 --> 25:25.666
-Okay, ready?
-Yeah.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.166
All right.

25:36.708 --> 25:38.708
-Another year begins anew,

25:38.791 --> 25:41.250
-Maiden, Mother, and Crone too.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.875
-We call on thee with one request,

25:43.958 --> 25:45.958
-help our intentions manifest.

25:52.541 --> 25:53.916
- It won't go out.

25:56.666 --> 25:57.583
-Becca.
-Hang on.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.791
Thanks a lot, Gilbert.

26:03.541 --> 26:05.083
-Almost started a forest fire.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.708
-Oh, okay.

26:10.958 --> 26:12.583
-Okay.

26:13.000 --> 26:13.833
- What the...

26:15.166 --> 26:16.666
How, how is that?

26:21.208 --> 26:24.291
♪ Come little children ♪

26:24.375 --> 26:28.583
♪ I'll take thee away ♪

26:28.666 --> 26:32.333
♪ Into a land of enchantment ♪

26:32.416 --> 26:33.458
Izzy?

26:34.708 --> 26:36.041
Becca.

26:39.416 --> 26:40.708
Why is everything so quiet?

26:41.750 --> 26:43.208
I don't know.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.666
-- Um...

27:01.083 --> 27:03.541
What is that? What is that?
Why is everything... What...

27:06.875 --> 27:08.750
-Here we go.
-What, what is happening?

27:09.875 --> 27:11.083
-Here we go.
-Izzy!

27:11.875 --> 27:13.708
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.458
Nope.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.750
Go, go, go!

27:36.583 --> 27:39.916
-- Are you still here?
-- Yeah, yeah.

27:41.083 --> 27:42.791
BECCA Wasn't there a moon?

27:46.708 --> 27:50.208
-What's... What's going on?
-- I don't know. I don't know.

27:52.625 --> 27:54.166
-- It's lightning. It's lightning.
-- It's lightning.

27:54.375 --> 27:55.458
It's lightning, right? Yeah.

27:55.541 --> 27:56.708
-- It's lightning. It's lightning.
-- Yeah.

28:00.583 --> 28:02.916
- Lock up your children.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.833
Yes, Salem. We're back.

28:08.958 --> 28:10.625
Are those the Sanderson Sisters?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.666

-Hello.

29:05.083 --> 29:08.083
-- Oh, well, well, well.
-Hi.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.916
Good work, sisters.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.958
How convenient.
Two little mortals ripe for picking.

29:15.375 --> 29:17.125
Come, sisters.

29:17.208 --> 29:19.375
If we intend to live past sunrise,

29:19.458 --> 29:23.708
we have to brew the life potion
and steal their souls.

29:24.666 --> 29:28.916
Book!

29:37.833 --> 29:39.916
Where, oh, where is his beacon of light?

29:40.833 --> 29:42.250
Have I been forsaken?

29:42.875 --> 29:45.833
-I cannot steal their souls without him.
-Boo.

29:45.916 --> 29:47.958
-Sister Mary, help me. Help me.
-Yes.

29:48.041 --> 29:49.083
-Yes, yes, yes, Sister Winifred.
-Bop.

29:49.166 --> 29:50.166
-No.
-Very good.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.666
Where was he last seen?

29:51.750 --> 29:52.916
-Retrace our steps.
-Okay.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.250
Oh, okay. Oh, I got it.

29:54.333 --> 29:57.333
If my memory serves me incorrectly,
we were in the cottage.

29:57.416 --> 30:01.416
The boys were in the cages
and that's when that sunrise tricked us.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.416
Fake sunrise.

30:02.583 --> 30:05.166
This time there will be no trickery.

30:05.250 --> 30:06.291
-No way.
-No trickery.

30:07.083 --> 30:10.625
if we see a teenager, we will kill it.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.000
Yes!

30:13.083 --> 30:14.666
Wait, wait.
We're not, we're not teenagers.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.416
-No.
-We only look young, but,

30:16.500 --> 30:18.750
but really, we're... 40.

30:18.833 --> 30:19.666
Forty?

30:19.750 --> 30:21.083
-Oh, 40?
-Old folks, huh?

30:21.166 --> 30:23.333
-Very fine position.
-You must say.

30:23.416 --> 30:25.416
-- I think it's the quality...
-- They're aged.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.416
-of their complexion and skin.
-Yeah.

30:26.500 --> 30:29.250
Yeah. I mean,
we eat young souls all the time.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.750
That's... we're just like you guys.
That's why we brought you back.

30:31.833 --> 30:34.125
You are our idols.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.708
-Idols?
-Really?

30:37.166 --> 30:40.416
-My favorite word. Thou dost worship us?
-Sayeth more.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.291
-Of course.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.166
Which one do you like the best?

30:44.250 --> 30:45.083
Don't say, don't say.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.791
-I know, I know, I know.
-Get in line. Get in line.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.375
And great news.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.875
You don't even have to brew
the potions anymore.

30:49.958 --> 30:50.791
You could just buy them.

30:50.875 --> 30:51.708
Yeah.

30:51.791 --> 30:52.625
Buy them?

30:52.708 --> 30:53.833
-Buy them?
-Imagine.

30:53.916 --> 30:55.750
Yes, we have a whole youth
and beauty industry,

30:55.833 --> 30:58.916
you know, shops where you can go buy
all sorts of serums and lotions.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.208
-Lotions?
-Lo...

31:00.291 --> 31:02.458
Oh, lotions. Like potions.

31:02.541 --> 31:03.375
Potion.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.291
Yup, yup. Just like potions.

31:05.375 --> 31:08.333
Except better,
because the souls are already mixed in.

31:09.583 --> 31:12.916
No more luring children to their demise?

31:13.583 --> 31:15.791
-No. They're already demised.
-No.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.916
Oh, that's a great time hack.
Thank you kindly.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.166
I delighted in the luring.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.458
'Twas was my only job.

31:22.541 --> 31:23.375
-Alas.

31:23.458 --> 31:25.125
-Oh, yes.
-Sisters, let us confabulate.

31:25.208 --> 31:26.750
Oh, confabulate, confabulate.

31:35.083 --> 31:38.041
-The apothecary, apothecary, apothecary?
-Bottles and bottles of it. Yeah.

31:38.125 --> 31:39.583
-And break.

31:40.375 --> 31:43.166
Lead us to thine apothecary.

31:43.250 --> 31:45.208
-Now.
-Toot suite.

31:45.291 --> 31:46.416
-Yeah.

31:47.791 --> 31:49.291
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.375
'Tis powerful indeed.

31:51.458 --> 31:53.458
Look. Observe, sisters.

31:53.541 --> 31:56.541
It glows from within
with a sickening light.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.916
Yeah. Yeah, that's fluorescents for you.

32:02.666 --> 32:04.000
-Fluorescents?
-Yes.

32:04.083 --> 32:06.416
-You know, I think we knew her.
-Yes.

32:06.916 --> 32:08.333
I think she was in the Paris coven.

32:08.416 --> 32:12.333
-- Oh, she was fierceful.
-Oh, my. Such a lie.

32:13.625 --> 32:16.833
Oh, Winnie, the gates,
they parted for her.

32:16.916 --> 32:21.125
Oh. She must be very powerful.

32:21.916 --> 32:24.500
Well, so am I.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.708
Of course, Winnie.

32:27.708 --> 32:29.333
- Oh, careful.

32:29.416 --> 32:30.458
- Oh.

32:31.041 --> 32:33.666
Did you see? Look at that.

32:36.750 --> 32:40.416
-I'm just gonna...
-Go do it. Okay. I'll give it a try.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.541
Oh.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.958
Beautiful.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.083
-Look at it. This isn't an apothecary.
-Look, the Queen.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.500
This doesn't look a thing

32:48.583 --> 32:50.416
-like father's apothecary.
-It is bright.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.791
- Like the moon.

32:51.875 --> 32:53.333
-- It's not your mother's apothecary.
-- Where are the brats?

32:53.791 --> 32:58.708
And it is enormous.

32:58.791 --> 33:00.416
All right, so children's souls.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.791
-Children's souls.
-Oh, yes.

33:01.875 --> 33:04.666
-Children's souls.
-That would be aisle four.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.125
-Aisle? What's an aisle?
-Aisle.

33:06.208 --> 33:07.583
-- Aisle? Aisle, aisle?
-MARY,- Aisle? Aisle?

33:07.666 --> 33:09.458
-No, what's thee saying?
-I'll flay thee alive.

33:09.541 --> 33:10.375
Where are the potions?

33:10.458 --> 33:12.083
You look at the numbers in the sky.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.083
-Oh, in the sky.
-Oh, there.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.125
No, you fool.

33:15.208 --> 33:17.125
She means the sign.

33:17.208 --> 33:20.375
They beckon thee. Sisters.

33:23.833 --> 33:25.291
- Yes. We're right behind you.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.625
Just, uh, look for anything
that says youth.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.291
WINIFRED, MARY, SARAH
Youth. Youth. Youth.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.250
Youth. Youth. Youth. Youth. Youth.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.291
-Okay, let's get out of here.
-Okay.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.375
-Boo!

33:33.458 --> 33:36.708
I love that. It works every time.

33:36.791 --> 33:42.250
So where on earth are you two
delicious morsels going, huh?

33:42.833 --> 33:45.458
-Nowhere.
-No, no, no. Not running away.

33:45.541 --> 33:47.791
Uh, we're just giving you some space.

33:47.875 --> 33:50.166
Oh, no, I don't like space.

33:50.250 --> 33:53.208
Oh, come on, my friends, let's get closer.

33:53.291 --> 33:54.666
Closer, right?

33:54.750 --> 33:59.875
So I can be close enough
just in case I decide to eat you.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.000
Soup's on.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.250
Shall we?

34:04.333 --> 34:06.083
Oh, dinner for three.

34:14.708 --> 34:16.583
-- Good.
-Delicious.

34:16.666 --> 34:20.333
Floral with a woodsy finish.

34:20.416 --> 34:21.916
- Tastes tinkly.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.541
My favorite feeling.

34:23.625 --> 34:25.250
That means it's working.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Look. 'Tis the face of a child.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.500
A newborn.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.708
- Oh, sister.
What does it taste like?

34:34.791 --> 34:36.166
Raspberry.

34:36.250 --> 34:39.208
-Can I have a bite of the face, please?
-Please, help thee self.

34:39.291 --> 34:41.958
-- Poor baby.
-Should we tell them?

34:42.041 --> 34:42.958
No.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.500
Oh, "Retinol".

34:45.583 --> 34:48.291
What a charming name for a child.

34:48.375 --> 34:50.208
-Okay, we should get some salt.
-- Oh, little Retinol.

34:50.291 --> 34:52.541
Why? So we taste better when they eat us?

34:52.625 --> 34:54.291
No, because it protects
against dark magic.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.666
At least, that's what Gilbert says
to get people to buy it.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.541
Gilbert? Really?

34:58.625 --> 35:00.791
Are you the Sanderson Sisters?

35:09.625 --> 35:11.166
-Perfect. Okay, now, go, go.
-Okay, okay.

35:11.250 --> 35:12.791
Art thee?

35:12.875 --> 35:15.250
We're obsessed with those looks.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.166
Can we take a photo?

35:17.625 --> 35:20.416
-Photo? Photo? We eat thy lives.
-Photo? I don't...

35:20.500 --> 35:21.875
-It's a drawing.
-Yes.

35:21.958 --> 35:24.041
-What are we going to do?
-Oh, very close now.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.750
-So good.

35:28.583 --> 35:31.416
- Look at that. We are ravishing.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.666
-We are very...
-Fetching.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.458
-Fetching, fetching.
-Foxy.

35:34.541 --> 35:35.375
-Foxy.

35:35.458 --> 35:37.833
Yeah, see? The lotions work.

35:37.916 --> 35:40.416
Why are these children dressed like us?

35:40.500 --> 35:42.583
Oh, because they also worship you.

35:42.666 --> 35:43.916
Of course.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.750
-Yeah.
-Thank thee.

35:45.833 --> 35:48.541
Although all thy flattery
will not save thee

35:48.625 --> 35:51.083
when it comes time for me
to fricassee you.

35:54.291 --> 35:56.291
-Uh-oh. Winnie.

36:02.166 --> 36:04.791
The... The little box lied.

36:06.750 --> 36:09.500
How many children's souls
are in those potions?

36:09.583 --> 36:12.166
-Who?
-How many souls?

36:12.250 --> 36:13.750
-Zero?

36:13.833 --> 36:15.041
La.

36:20.041 --> 36:21.750
-Teenager.
-No, no.

36:21.833 --> 36:23.625
He's just confused.
Don't listen to him, okay?

36:23.708 --> 36:25.041
Look, trust me. You look amazing.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.333
The potions work.
It's just, it's just bad lighting.

36:27.416 --> 36:29.166
-Curse the lighting.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.791
-- Whoa, is that serious?
-Oh-oh.

36:30.875 --> 36:32.625
That's not good. Okay, okay, okay.

36:32.708 --> 36:33.750
- Where are you?

36:33.833 --> 36:35.250
And curse thee.

36:35.375 --> 36:37.375
-- Yeah!

36:41.583 --> 36:43.375
-Are you okay? Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:43.458 --> 36:44.875
I didn't know what to grab.
I just grabbed everything.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.416
Oh, there they are.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.500
Say hello to Satan for me.

36:53.125 --> 36:54.291
- Oh!

36:54.375 --> 36:56.750
-Salt can do that?
-Do it.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.583
- Oh, my God.
We gotta get out of here.

36:58.666 --> 37:01.750
-Holy Lucifer, how did she do that?
-What the...

37:01.833 --> 37:03.166
-What care I.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.708
We need my Book.

37:04.791 --> 37:08.916
We must brew the life potion
or our fate will be sealed at sunrise.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.041
-Sunrise again.
-Again.

37:10.125 --> 37:12.541
Oh, Mary. I cannot take another minute.

37:12.625 --> 37:15.833
-You wanna hit me?
-No. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.

37:15.916 --> 37:18.791
We already drank the life potion.

37:18.875 --> 37:21.625
-Simpleton. Those were a hoax.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.041
-We're wasting time. We must fly.
-Fly.

37:25.125 --> 37:25.958
On what?

37:28.166 --> 37:31.041
-Just like my old one.

37:31.125 --> 37:33.083
Oh, well, What about us?

37:33.166 --> 37:34.250
There's only one.

37:34.333 --> 37:36.375
Bats and beetles,
find something, anything.

37:36.458 --> 37:38.041
We must fly.

37:41.208 --> 37:45.625
- Winnie, my broomies are misbehaving.

37:45.708 --> 37:48.750
Uh-oh. Winnie, I'm surfing.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.791
Cowabunga.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.583
Winnie.

37:55.875 --> 37:57.958
What unholy dance art thou doing?

37:58.041 --> 38:00.666
I don't know.
They were the only broomies left.

38:00.750 --> 38:01.958
The man said,

38:02.041 --> 38:03.875
“Be careful,
they have a mind of their own.”

38:03.958 --> 38:05.041
He's right.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.541
- Stop it. Sit.

38:06.625 --> 38:08.000
Sisters, focus.

38:08.083 --> 38:12.791
We must fly to our ancestral cottage,
get Book, and brew our potion.

38:12.875 --> 38:13.875
And then, what, Winnie?

38:13.958 --> 38:16.625
-Then, what?
-Then we run amok in Salem.

38:16.708 --> 38:19.875
♪ Oh, amok, amok, amok
Amok, amok, amok... ♪

38:19.958 --> 38:21.041
Stop that.

38:21.125 --> 38:24.625
- Don’t make me come over
there with this broom.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.791
Gilbert. Where did you get that candle?

38:41.875 --> 38:43.083
We have to get the book out to here.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.250
The witches will be here any second.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.250
The... The book is alive.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.166
He woke up?

38:51.583 --> 38:53.333
Hey, buddy.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.458
-You guys know each other?

38:58.583 --> 38:59.541
Ah.

38:59.625 --> 39:01.291
Hey. Remember me?

39:01.375 --> 39:02.791
Yeah, it's Gilbert.

39:02.875 --> 39:05.625
Gilbert the Great because,
yeah, I've earned the title now

39:05.708 --> 39:08.208
with my knowledge of magical
and the occult, but...

39:08.291 --> 39:09.416
Uh-huh. Yeah.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.000
Oh, my goodness.

39:11.416 --> 39:13.708
It's so incredible. I can't believe this.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.666
-- I can't believe it worked.
-Shut it.

39:22.375 --> 39:24.333
-What were they like?
-No, what do you mean "it worked?"

39:24.416 --> 39:26.000
Did they sing?
Because, you know, they love to sing.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.916
Wait, you knew
that was a Black Flame Candle?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.708
Look, I am so sorry
I had to trick you, but...

39:30.791 --> 39:32.208
I mean, I couldn't light
the candle myself.

39:32.291 --> 39:34.916
-It just it wouldn't have worked.
-Well, why not?

39:36.666 --> 39:38.333
Oh, ew.

39:38.416 --> 39:39.541
- Why would you do this?

39:39.625 --> 39:40.583
They're evil.

39:40.666 --> 39:42.625
Well, only because they had to be.

39:42.708 --> 39:45.958
You know, they were ahead of their time
and they were misunderstood.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.833
Then, the whole world was against them.

39:47.916 --> 39:49.958
But now, look, everybody loves them.
Look at all this stuff.

39:51.750 --> 39:54.125
-Oh, my God.
-At last.

39:54.208 --> 39:57.791
Back to our squall and verminous abode.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.541
Home sweet.

40:01.083 --> 40:02.500
No.

40:02.583 --> 40:07.125
Where are all the cobwebs...
and my rat tails?

40:07.208 --> 40:09.833
Uh-oh. Winnie, hold me.

40:09.916 --> 40:13.000
Oh, it no longer smells like death.

40:13.375 --> 40:15.333
Now, it smells like...

40:15.416 --> 40:17.041
-- Clean linen.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.083
Yeah, we have a plug-in for that.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.625
A boy.

40:20.708 --> 40:24.791
Hi, I'm Gilbert the Great
and I am your biggest fan.

40:25.416 --> 40:26.250
My Book.

40:29.083 --> 40:30.250
Oh.

40:31.458 --> 40:33.083
-Oh, my darling, they hurt you.
-Is he okay?

40:33.166 --> 40:34.166
-Did he break anything?
-Oh, goodness, gracious.

40:34.250 --> 40:36.291
Oh, my darling. Oh.

40:36.375 --> 40:38.208
I've missed thee.

40:39.125 --> 40:41.291
- My beautiful Book.
How's your eye?

40:41.375 --> 40:43.916
-- Where are my lucky rat tails?
-- Uh-oh.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.833
Winnie, look, I found
the two 40-year-old teenagers.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.958
-Oh, Winnie, can we kill them now?
-All in good time.

40:54.041 --> 40:56.375
A quick death will be too kind
for these two.

40:56.458 --> 40:58.166
Here. Hold my darling.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.333
-And don't drop it like you just did.
-Thank you.

41:00.416 --> 41:02.708
Throw them in the dungeon.

41:03.166 --> 41:04.625
-My pleasure.
-Dungeon?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Bye-bye.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.458
Ah, good work, Mary.

41:12.541 --> 41:15.625
-Uh, whoa. Wait. Can we talk about this?
-No.

41:19.458 --> 41:24.458
None shall see or hear thee shout,
heed my words there's no way out.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.958
That's a big ole yikes.

41:32.041 --> 41:33.333
-- No, you haven't.
-- Oh, sisters,

41:33.416 --> 41:34.750
-haven't lost my touch.

41:34.833 --> 41:36.000
-No, Winnie.
-You know,

41:36.083 --> 41:39.750
whatever those two may have done,
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.041
-- What are we going to do?
-- I don't know. I don't know.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.250
Um, maybe we can through there's windows.

41:44.333 --> 41:45.791
-Window, window. Window.
-Window, window.

41:47.250 --> 41:48.875
-No. Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

41:48.958 --> 41:51.416
Yeah, I've been trying to bring you back
ever since I saw you that night.

41:53.583 --> 41:54.541
That night?

41:55.375 --> 41:56.625
- Hm.

41:58.041 --> 41:59.375
What night?

42:01.333 --> 42:03.791
Halloween, 1993.

42:05.208 --> 42:07.708
- Not a great year for me.

42:07.791 --> 42:09.458
Bunch of boys stole all my candy.

42:10.666 --> 42:12.416
-But then...

42:13.041 --> 42:14.791
...I saw you.

42:16.458 --> 42:18.791
I chased you all the way to the cemetery.

42:19.166 --> 42:20.708
Goodbye.

42:20.791 --> 42:23.541
-Wha...
-Bye-bye.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.958
-- But I was too late.

42:26.041 --> 42:30.250
Oh, my. You're very close. Yeah.

42:30.333 --> 42:32.958
Oh. Ma'am, so I, I, you know,
I want to know for sure.

42:33.041 --> 42:36.666
So I went to see if the candle
was lit and I found Book.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.125
He was awake.

42:39.666 --> 42:40.958
He showed me how to make another candle.

42:41.041 --> 42:44.833
-I mean, it wasn't pretty but...
-- Oh, my beloved Book.

42:44.916 --> 42:48.916
I knew thou wouldst have a plan
to bring Mommy back.

42:49.000 --> 42:54.833
La, la, la. And now, at long last,
it is time to conjure together once more.

42:54.916 --> 42:58.208
And what are we conjuring, exactly?
Perhaps something fun.

42:58.291 --> 42:59.375
-Maybe another...
-Silence.

42:59.458 --> 43:01.166
Uh-oh. Winnie...

43:01.541 --> 43:02.625
What is it?

43:03.583 --> 43:05.041
Tis the Reverend.

43:06.333 --> 43:10.208
-He... He's alive?
-Of course, not you ninny.

43:10.291 --> 43:11.833
Must be a descendant.

43:13.041 --> 43:14.916
-Who is this man?
-Oh, that's the mayor.

43:16.625 --> 43:18.375
Incomprehensible.

43:18.875 --> 43:22.000
Three hundred years later
and the dark cloud of Traske

43:22.083 --> 43:23.500
still looms over Salem.

43:24.166 --> 43:26.333
Mm, I told you we should have...

43:26.416 --> 43:28.583
...the entire family
when we had the chance.

43:28.666 --> 43:31.791
We tried, but we were too young
and too weak.

43:32.166 --> 43:35.166
Mother said one day,
witches would rule Salem.

43:35.250 --> 43:36.416
And what have we done instead?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.291
-Die?

43:40.375 --> 43:42.458
Oh, no, no, no, Winnie. Oh, oh, come back.

43:42.541 --> 43:44.208
Come back to mommy.
You're getting very worked up.

43:44.291 --> 43:45.333
-Deep breaths.
-You know, perhaps

43:45.416 --> 43:47.541
maybe like a calming circle might...

43:47.625 --> 43:50.666
-How'd you know about that?
-I read Reverend Traske's journals.

43:50.750 --> 43:53.750
-He wrote all about you.
-All nice things, I hope.

43:54.375 --> 43:56.458
-Not really.
-You know, just spitballing here,

43:56.541 --> 43:58.041
-but maybe we could make a life potion?
-Wouldn't he?

43:58.125 --> 43:59.833
-I'm done with piddling potions.
-Okay.

43:59.916 --> 44:02.833
If we were the most powerful witches
on Earth, nothing can stop us.

44:02.916 --> 44:06.125
Not teenagers, not Traskes,
not the infernal sun.

44:06.208 --> 44:09.333
Sisters, it has been decided.

44:09.416 --> 44:13.250
We are doing the Magicae Maxima.

44:13.833 --> 44:15.750
The Power Spell.

44:16.958 --> 44:19.666
- Oh, but Winnie, you promised
you'd never, ever do that spell.

44:19.750 --> 44:23.166
That was 300 years ago.
That promise has expired.

44:23.250 --> 44:25.333
-Expired. Oh, that makes sense to me.
-Guess you switched your lane.

44:33.458 --> 44:34.291
- You got it.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.500
-I don't think he cares for that spell.
-Yeah, I think she's right.

44:39.583 --> 44:40.625
-Maybe we should give him a minute...
-The book has opinions?

44:40.708 --> 44:42.125
-...to come around to it.
-- Careful.

44:42.208 --> 44:43.916
Oh, oh, no. No, not your teeth.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.208
-They're your calling card.
-- Help me out here, Mary.

44:46.291 --> 44:49.416
I still have mixed feelings
about helping you.

44:49.500 --> 44:52.375
-Just, it's a spell that I won't...
-Unhand me, you idiot.

44:52.458 --> 44:53.500
-I'm sorry.

44:55.041 --> 44:56.541
What is happening?

44:58.958 --> 45:00.291
Resistance is futile.

45:01.083 --> 45:03.500
-Show me the Power Spell.

45:04.250 --> 45:05.875
Now, the Power Spell.

45:05.958 --> 45:08.250
"Beware the Power Spell
for it is most dangerous,"

45:08.333 --> 45:10.041
Oh, fie, we have no time for warnings.

45:10.125 --> 45:12.041
-Ah!

45:12.125 --> 45:13.041
- At last.

45:13.666 --> 45:15.916
Oh, by Lucifer's hangnail.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.250
The incantation
has to be recited seven times.

45:18.333 --> 45:19.333
Don't you hate those?

45:19.416 --> 45:21.583
I mean, one flub and thou
must start all over again.

45:21.666 --> 45:22.500
It's, like, you're getting in the groove,

45:22.583 --> 45:24.708
-and then wha... I know.
-Right? Like, who has that kind of time?

45:24.791 --> 45:28.875
"Must be done is a sacred pla..."
Oh, a sacred place.

45:28.958 --> 45:30.625
We are not allowed in those.

45:30.708 --> 45:33.125
Not one of their sacred places,
you nitwit.

45:33.208 --> 45:34.750
-One of ours.
-Ours.

45:34.833 --> 45:36.666
-One of ours.
-The Forbidden Wood.

45:38.333 --> 45:39.625
That's our spot.

45:40.333 --> 45:41.291
-It's sacred?
-- Let's see,

45:41.375 --> 45:42.416
what else do we need?

45:42.666 --> 45:44.166
The head of a lover.

45:44.250 --> 45:48.291
Oh, yeah, that'd be a bummer,
because all of our lovers are gone.

45:48.375 --> 45:53.833
Oh, but we could find new ones.

45:54.333 --> 45:57.750
Nonsense. We'll simply dig up
my old lover, Billy Butcherson.

45:58.416 --> 46:01.458
Okay, sure.
But you know, Billy was my lover.

46:01.541 --> 46:04.375
Oh, Sarah. You were just a fling.
Let's see, what else?

46:04.458 --> 46:05.791
-- Witch's butter...
-- Butter.

46:05.875 --> 46:07.375
-...juice of an Aralia berry...
-- Berry.

46:07.458 --> 46:13.125
-...one petrified spider, and...
-Oh, one drop of thy enemy's blood.

46:13.208 --> 46:16.375
God, don't you love it
when the recipe requires blood?

46:16.458 --> 46:18.416
That reminds me. Gilbert?

46:18.500 --> 46:23.125
-Uh-huh.
-Does thou have the Sanderson hourglass?

46:24.791 --> 46:26.375
Um...

46:28.333 --> 46:30.708
Psssst. Um...

46:31.083 --> 46:32.958
You... No, actually, no.

46:33.041 --> 46:34.166
-- I don't, I don't think I do.
-Awkward.

46:34.250 --> 46:35.291
No problem at all.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.666
And since you don't have it,
we'll just have to kill thee.

46:38.750 --> 46:42.416
Oh, you said "hourglass" with an "H".
Yes, that I do have, actually.

46:42.500 --> 46:45.041
Yeah, I think I misheard you
when you said it before,

46:45.125 --> 46:47.583
-I thought that you and I...

46:49.583 --> 46:52.416
The Binx boy, he lives?

46:52.500 --> 46:54.583
That's just Cobweb. He's my cat.

46:54.666 --> 47:00.291
-I know 'tis really thee, Thackery.
-Die. Die, wretched feline.

47:00.375 --> 47:02.666
-No, no, no, don't kill him.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.041
I have your hourglass.

47:06.125 --> 47:08.750
The glass...

47:08.833 --> 47:14.916
Now do for me what I ask,
thy life depends upon this task.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.375
Oh.

47:16.458 --> 47:21.416
-What was that?
-Let's call it a binding contract.

47:21.500 --> 47:25.166
You shall gather all the ingredients
and bring them to the Forbidden Wood.

47:25.250 --> 47:28.625
And we shall sniff out the blood
of our enemy.

47:28.708 --> 47:30.875
-The Reverend.
-The Mayor.

47:30.958 --> 47:32.166
The Reverend Mayor.

47:32.250 --> 47:35.541
And if you fail, you forfeit your life...

47:36.041 --> 47:40.375
with the last grain of this sand.

47:42.333 --> 47:43.333
Uh...

47:44.125 --> 47:48.291
-Best of luck, Gilbert.
-Oh, and Wilbert, I made thee a list.

47:48.375 --> 47:50.458
Thy life depends upon it.

47:50.541 --> 47:53.291
Oh, you just had to keep
that hourglass, didn't you?

47:53.375 --> 47:58.041
Now, wait here while
I go to find that wretched Traske.

47:58.708 --> 48:03.041
And darling, be sure to come
to me when I call.

48:05.625 --> 48:08.958
Sisters, come along.
The Mayor's blood awaits.

48:10.416 --> 48:12.208
Oh, my God.
They're going to kill Mr. Traske.

48:12.291 --> 48:14.291
Once they do that Power Spell,
I think they're going to kill everybody.

48:14.916 --> 48:16.833
Okay. Not to freak out, but the idea

48:16.916 --> 48:19.166
of a vengeful maniac obsessed
with getting revenge on Salem

48:19.250 --> 48:21.625
becoming an invincible, all-powerful,

48:21.708 --> 48:23.750
vengeful maniac obsessed
with getting revenge on Salem

48:23.833 --> 48:26.250
sounds very bad for Salem.

48:26.333 --> 48:27.666
-We have to tell Cassie.
-Okay.

48:27.750 --> 48:29.125
Do you think she'll even answer?

48:32.083 --> 48:33.125
Come on, come on, come on.

48:33.208 --> 48:36.541
-- ♪ Go, Glenn. Go, Glenn. Go, go ♪

48:36.625 --> 48:38.250
♪ Go, go. Go, Glenn. Go, Glenn. Go, go ♪

48:42.791 --> 48:44.166
Hey, Becca?

48:44.250 --> 48:46.333
The Sanderson Sisters are back
and they're coming after your dad.

48:46.416 --> 48:47.833
Hey, Becca, I can't hear... Are you there?

48:47.916 --> 48:51.166
I think you might be covering your camera.
I can't see you. Are you coming over?

48:52.791 --> 48:55.125
-Hey, babe.
-Hi. Can you go check on that, baby?

48:55.208 --> 48:56.791
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

48:56.875 --> 48:59.041
Becca? Hey, Bec?

48:59.125 --> 49:00.416
- She can't hear us.

49:01.416 --> 49:02.875
It's butt-dial. Awesome.

49:04.208 --> 49:06.541
Okay. I guess
the curse covers phones, too.

49:06.625 --> 49:08.291
-I know.
-There's no way out of here.

49:10.125 --> 49:11.333
Yes, there is.

49:12.958 --> 49:14.375
Angelica leaves.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.291
They lift curses.

49:17.916 --> 49:21.583
Hey, if candles can bring back the dead,
why can't potpourri bring back the stairs?

49:22.125 --> 49:23.166
Okay.

49:25.375 --> 49:26.583
- Head of a lover.

49:30.250 --> 49:32.375
How am I going to dig up
a full grave in time?

49:33.083 --> 49:34.583
I am so dead.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.375
Ah.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.250
That's not six feet under.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.541
Who are you?

49:53.333 --> 49:58.666
-Zombie. Killer zombie.
-No. Hey, stop. I am a good zombie.

49:58.750 --> 50:02.083
-I'm not even chasing thee.
-Stay back.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.833
And don't try to eat my brains.

50:05.833 --> 50:07.416
Why would I...

50:07.500 --> 50:10.333
I simply wish to know
why you were digging up me grave.

50:10.416 --> 50:13.875
And I simply wish to know
why you're alive.

50:13.958 --> 50:17.041
Well, because I was woken up
and never put back to sleep.

50:17.125 --> 50:18.500
Well, I've been awake since...

50:20.291 --> 50:22.000
How long ago was 1993?

50:22.583 --> 50:26.500
Wait, were you there that night?
With the Sanderson Sisters?

50:26.583 --> 50:30.250
-Uh... unfortunately.
-Well, guess what?

50:31.166 --> 50:33.833
They're back again.

50:33.916 --> 50:37.375
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no, wait.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.666
-I need your help.

50:42.333 --> 50:44.125
I'm doing this spell to kill Winifred...

50:44.875 --> 50:45.833
for good.

50:45.916 --> 50:47.708
I mean, don't you want to pay
her back for poisoning you

50:47.791 --> 50:50.625
and sewing your mouth shut?

50:51.125 --> 50:54.000
-Thou knoweth how I die?
-Well, yeah.

50:54.083 --> 50:57.291
Everyone knoweth the legend
of Billy Butcherson.

50:57.666 --> 50:59.250
You were Winifred's lover

50:59.333 --> 51:00.958
and you cheat on her
with Sarah so she killed you.

51:01.041 --> 51:02.791
What? No, no.

51:02.875 --> 51:05.333
No, no, no. That is not what happened.

51:06.625 --> 51:09.791
I shared one kiss with Winifred.

51:10.291 --> 51:11.500
One.

51:11.583 --> 51:17.000
Oh, she has sullied my name for eternity.

51:17.208 --> 51:20.166
Well, if you help me gather
everything I need for the spell,

51:21.125 --> 51:23.291
I will tell everyone the truth about you.

51:23.375 --> 51:24.375
Huh?

51:24.458 --> 51:25.666
So what do you say?

51:27.958 --> 51:29.083
Partners?

51:30.750 --> 51:31.750
Mm.

51:36.375 --> 51:38.291
Sorry.

51:38.375 --> 51:39.458
Um-hm.

51:40.208 --> 51:42.333
There we go. Right as rain.

51:48.833 --> 51:50.125
Corn, I smell corn.

51:50.208 --> 51:51.375
-Step lively.
-Wait.

51:51.458 --> 51:53.125
-We are looking for the Mayor.
-Oh, yeah.

51:53.208 --> 51:55.250
-And here are you.
-Thank you.

51:57.333 --> 51:58.875
Have you had these before?

51:58.958 --> 52:02.166
Oh, get ready. Get ready.

52:03.125 --> 52:04.166
Oh, my.

52:04.958 --> 52:06.750
Have you seen the Mayor?

52:06.833 --> 52:07.791
- Have you seen the Mayor?

52:07.875 --> 52:09.708
Come on, get that apple, man!

52:10.125 --> 52:12.875
- Yeah! Come on, I got more than this!

52:12.958 --> 52:15.583
-Oh, look.
-Look it, they're drowning a man.

52:15.666 --> 52:16.625
How charming.

52:16.708 --> 52:19.666
I like this festival.

52:21.166 --> 52:23.208
Oh, look. He has an apple in his mouth.

52:23.500 --> 52:25.666
Perhaps they're going to roast him
on a spit.

52:25.750 --> 52:27.416
Oh, my brooms would love this.

52:27.500 --> 52:28.875
Let me get the girls. Where are the--

52:28.958 --> 52:31.666
-Oh, there they are.
-Oh, sweeties.

52:31.750 --> 52:34.291
-They have a mind of their own.
-What?

52:55.333 --> 52:56.416
Now what?

52:57.166 --> 52:59.500
- Poisoned apple.

53:00.833 --> 53:02.541
Poisoned apple.

53:03.708 --> 53:05.250
Poisoned apple.

53:08.041 --> 53:10.291
Would you like a poisoned apple?

53:10.375 --> 53:13.708
Oh, thou must never announce
that they're poisoned, sister.

53:14.166 --> 53:16.916
No one will eat them
if they think they're deadly.

53:17.500 --> 53:18.375
Amateur.

53:19.375 --> 53:20.750
That looks scrumptious.

53:20.833 --> 53:23.541
-Maybe I could just have one big bi...
-No eating until we find the Mayor.

53:23.625 --> 53:25.333
Okay. Sorry.

53:25.416 --> 53:27.125
Sarah, come.

53:27.208 --> 53:28.208
-Oh!
-- Come.

53:31.375 --> 53:34.833
Uh, maybe we do a hand-waving thing
like the witches do?

53:37.166 --> 53:39.875
Lift the curse and let us out.

53:40.958 --> 53:41.833
You.

53:45.416 --> 53:47.958
-Lift the curse and let us out.

53:48.041 --> 53:51.333
-Lift the curse and let us out.

53:51.416 --> 53:54.041
-Lift the curse and let us out.

53:54.125 --> 53:55.875
-Lift the curse and let us out.
-Lift the curse and let us...

53:58.708 --> 54:00.458
-Oh, my Goddess, it worked.

54:00.541 --> 54:01.750
I can't believe it worked.

54:01.833 --> 54:03.708
Oh, I always thought Gilbert
was lying about this stuff.

54:04.125 --> 54:05.833
We need to get Mr. Traske somewhere safe.

54:05.916 --> 54:07.625
We should probably get that book away
from the witches.

54:07.708 --> 54:08.583
Okay. I'll call him

54:08.666 --> 54:09.875
-and you find the book.
-Got it.

54:16.625 --> 54:18.458
-Hello?
-- Hey, Mr. Traske.

54:18.541 --> 54:20.250
-Um, it's Becca.
-Oh, hey, Becca.

54:20.333 --> 54:22.000
Sorry to do this, but...

54:22.083 --> 54:24.791
-Cassie's throwing a party.
-Oh, fun. Where?

54:24.875 --> 54:26.208
-- At your house.
-What?

54:26.291 --> 54:27.250
With boys.

54:28.416 --> 54:30.125
You should get home as soon as possible.

54:32.208 --> 54:34.333
I'm sorry, would you mind saving
my place in line?

54:34.416 --> 54:36.333
My daughter's about to ruin her future.

54:38.250 --> 54:39.416
Okay. He's safe now.

54:42.041 --> 54:44.958
Book, book, book. Where would it be?

54:50.583 --> 54:52.750
Cobweb, you genius.

55:13.416 --> 55:15.708
I got it. Come on, come on.

55:16.833 --> 55:18.875
Izzy. No.

55:18.958 --> 55:20.750
Oh, I'm coming! I'm coming!

55:20.833 --> 55:23.250
Oh, please don't kick me. Don't kick me.

55:23.833 --> 55:25.708
God, this is so much harder than it looks.

55:25.791 --> 55:28.583
-I know.
-How is this book so strong?

55:28.666 --> 55:30.833
What is wrong with this book?

55:30.916 --> 55:31.916
I'm slipping. No.

55:34.541 --> 55:35.708
- What was that all about?

55:35.791 --> 55:38.125
They must've put a spell
on the book or something.

55:38.208 --> 55:39.416
Now what?

55:39.916 --> 55:42.041
We need to get to Cassie's
before the witches do.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.416
-Remember. Stay the course.
-Stay the course.

55:48.500 --> 55:50.083
Absolutely no more distractions.
Say it after...

55:50.166 --> 55:54.000
Hey, it's the Sanderson Sisters.
All right, looking good.

55:54.666 --> 55:56.125
I bet you're looking for the stage.

55:57.500 --> 55:59.000
Always.

55:59.625 --> 56:02.666
And I said, "Sanderson?
You Sanderson, you Burnerson."

56:04.416 --> 56:05.291
- I don't get it.

56:05.375 --> 56:06.583
Ooh, look at this.

56:06.666 --> 56:11.416
One last challenger emerges
in the Sanderson Sisters costume contest.

56:11.500 --> 56:14.208
Looking good, fellas. Very authentic.

56:14.291 --> 56:15.958
Thank you. Thank you.

56:16.041 --> 56:19.708
If only... If these are all worshippers...

56:19.791 --> 56:22.791
-Then this must be, the altar.
-Yes?

56:22.875 --> 56:25.250
All right, let's give it up for...

56:25.333 --> 56:27.041
Hey, Winnie, what do you call yourselves?

56:28.083 --> 56:29.708
The originals.

56:31.416 --> 56:32.541
How original.

56:32.625 --> 56:33.750
- All right.

56:34.041 --> 56:36.500
Well, you're pretty late so back it up
with the other finalists.

56:36.583 --> 56:38.166
-Back it up.
-All right.

56:39.291 --> 56:41.083
Is that what I look like?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.625
Darn, girl. We look foxy.

56:47.666 --> 56:50.583
Ooh. Hello, me. Hello, me.

56:50.666 --> 56:51.625
Hello, me.

56:53.291 --> 56:54.958
Lose the teeth.

56:55.708 --> 56:58.000
Mind your business, girl.

56:58.666 --> 56:59.708
All right, people.

56:59.791 --> 57:01.541
-Thanks, pilgrim. Howdy.
-Who is that witch?

57:01.625 --> 57:03.791
You're doing great. We have a winner.

57:03.875 --> 57:06.583
Scary drumroll, please.

57:08.666 --> 57:09.750
- Roll the drum.

57:09.833 --> 57:10.916
A roll.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.208
Oh, roll sounds delicious.

57:12.458 --> 57:14.291
-Can we go?
-We cannot go.

57:14.375 --> 57:18.791
-We're about to win whatever this is.
-All right, put your hands together for...

57:18.875 --> 57:20.291
Oh, look surprised.

57:20.375 --> 57:21.791
The Sandersonettes.

57:25.625 --> 57:29.000
-- We won. We won. We won.
-- Wait.

57:29.083 --> 57:31.750
What sayeth thou? What sayeth thou?

57:31.833 --> 57:35.500
There's been a grievous error.
Begone. They do not want you here.

57:35.583 --> 57:36.833
See? They despise you.

57:36.916 --> 57:39.708
-Begone, begone.
-So, get it quick. Relax.

57:39.791 --> 57:40.833
Everyone picks...

57:44.375 --> 57:46.125
-What a witch.
-People of Salem,

57:47.041 --> 57:51.958
-we have come for the blood of thy Mayor.
-They're doing a bit.

57:52.250 --> 57:57.416
-That's right, girls. Take all his blood.
-With pleasure.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.166
-But where is he?
-Where is he?

58:03.291 --> 58:05.250
Observe, sisters.

58:05.333 --> 58:07.958
The villagers do not wish to comply.

58:08.041 --> 58:10.708
-- Whatever shall we do?
-Oh, they do...

58:10.791 --> 58:12.166
We could give them a spell.

58:12.250 --> 58:13.333
-Put them under a spell.

58:13.416 --> 58:14.625
-Bewitch them.

58:14.708 --> 58:17.916
-Mary, what a brilliant idea.
-- Bless you, too.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.416
Clear the altar, all of you.
Clear my stage.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.916
And you.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.791
Try to keep up.

1:09:16.166 --> 1:09:20.125
I kept asking you guys to hang out
and you would just flake or not respond.

1:09:20.208 --> 1:09:23.500
Because everything you wanted to do
involved Mike and his friends.

1:09:23.583 --> 1:09:25.708

I don't make fun of you guys.

1:09:37.916 --> 1:09:39.708
Yeah, you call us witches
and say that we're weird.

1:09:39.791 --> 1:09:43.750
Yeah, because you hang out in magic stores
and always carry around colorful rocks.

1:09:43.833 --> 1:09:47.083

Okay, pointing out people's differences

1:09:50.208 --> 1:09:52.791

1:10:15.833 --> 1:10:17.291
No, where are you going?

1:10:19.291 --> 1:10:23.291

1:10:59.416 --> 1:11:02.666
I love the resting witch face.

1:11:02.750 --> 1:11:04.500
Do you want me to play along? I'll...

1:11:04.583 --> 1:11:06.208

1:11:06.291 --> 1:11:09.250

1:11:11.666 --> 1:11:12.750
Nah, that wasn't that great.

1:11:12.833 --> 1:11:14.916
By the way,
I'm not being a very good host.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.750
I haven't even formally introduced myself.

1:11:16.833 --> 1:11:18.916
-I'm the Mayor...
-Wait, Dad.

1:11:20.958 --> 1:11:22.583
Ooh.

1:11:33.500 --> 1:11:35.750
Oh, if only we weren't trapped.

1:11:36.291 --> 1:11:38.375
What?

1:11:38.458 --> 1:11:39.958
Seriously, what's going on?

1:11:40.750 --> 1:11:42.458
What a cruel world.

1:11:42.541 --> 1:11:45.958
We finally have the blood
on the nary our nostrils,

1:11:46.041 --> 1:11:50.125
yet we are trapped in salt,
like a slab of corned beef.

1:11:50.541 --> 1:11:52.541
-What are you doing? What are you doing?
-Well, it's for your safety.

1:11:52.625 --> 1:11:53.458
What do you mean it's for my safety?

1:11:53.541 --> 1:11:54.833
-Stop, stop, stop.
-- A cruel world.

1:11:54.916 --> 1:11:57.041
-What a cruel world.
-Whatever this is, I'm in no mood.

1:11:57.125 --> 1:11:59.250
I've had an awful day, do you know that?

1:11:59.333 --> 1:12:01.875
God knows what kind of unchaperoned
house party you were throwing in there

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:04.958
and then I come home to like
the gothic Golden Girls in my garage.

1:12:05.041 --> 1:12:08.125
What the heck?
This has been a very bad Halloween.

1:12:08.208 --> 1:12:10.750
Well, at least you got
your caramel apple, right?

1:12:10.833 --> 1:12:11.958
Oh, okay.

1:12:12.041 --> 1:12:13.625
Actually, I didn't,
because after mine was stolen,

1:12:13.708 --> 1:12:16.166
I went back and Sandy
had given away all of her apples.

1:12:16.250 --> 1:12:17.958
Which I think is really unprofessional,
right?

1:12:18.041 --> 1:12:18.958
So I didn't get an apple,

1:12:19.041 --> 1:12:21.791
so then I went to some Walgreen's
who turned out their lights.

1:12:21.875 --> 1:12:25.875
Which makes no sense.
What Walgreen's turns out their lights?

1:12:25.958 --> 1:12:28.791
Okay? But you know what I got?
You know what I got in the dark?

1:12:28.875 --> 1:12:31.458
This pathetic thing, this. Look at this.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.375
I don't even know
if there's an apple in there.

1:12:33.458 --> 1:12:35.583
No, this is probably a caramel
covered matzah ball for all I know.

1:12:35.666 --> 1:12:37.541
But, you know what?
I'm gonna eat it and I'm gonna like it.

1:12:40.458 --> 1:12:41.333
I feel so bad.

1:12:41.416 --> 1:12:43.416
He's been talking about
that caramel apple for weeks.

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:44.916
I'm just glad he's safe.

1:12:47.833 --> 1:12:48.875
- Winnie.

1:12:54.083 --> 1:12:55.583
Winnie, look.

1:12:55.666 --> 1:12:56.750
I cannot.

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:58.416
My eyes have misted over

1:12:58.500 --> 1:13:01.916
with the tragic tears
of a lifetime of failure.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:07.041
Looky, my broomies.
They hate mess. Do you see this?

1:13:07.125 --> 1:13:09.166
-Come to momma. Oh, come on.

1:13:09.250 --> 1:13:10.583
-- Look at it.

1:13:10.666 --> 1:13:12.250
-Look it, see what happens, they love it.

1:13:12.333 --> 1:13:15.625
That's right, go ahead, eat it up.
That's right. Yes, right there.

1:13:16.083 --> 1:13:17.291
Is your dad mad?

1:13:17.375 --> 1:13:19.583
Very. He wants everyone to leave.

1:13:19.666 --> 1:13:20.875
Well, we can hang out here,

1:13:20.958 --> 1:13:23.000
um, watch out
for the Sanderson Sisters until sunrise.

1:13:23.083 --> 1:13:25.916
Yeah, I'll tell my mom
we're sleeping over at Cassie's.

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.166
-She'll be so happy. She misses you.
-Aw, Susan.

1:13:31.333 --> 1:13:32.625
Let me go!

1:13:32.708 --> 1:13:33.875
-No!

1:13:33.958 --> 1:13:35.791
-- Stop!
-No!

1:13:35.875 --> 1:13:37.166
- No! Let go!

1:13:39.750 --> 1:13:40.958
What was that?

1:13:42.250 --> 1:13:44.291
I don't know.

1:13:45.666 --> 1:13:46.916
No, we gotta get Cassie.

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.333
-They're going to the woods.
-Okay.

1:13:48.416 --> 1:13:49.291
- Let's go.

1:14:08.958 --> 1:14:13.791
Head of a lover,
witch's butter, Aralia berry juice,

1:14:13.875 --> 1:14:17.291
and a petrified spider, I guess.

1:14:17.375 --> 1:14:19.416
Well, I did it. I'm not gonna die.

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:21.458
Oh, they're still gonna kill you.

1:14:22.666 --> 1:14:23.625
Mm.

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.583
Not if I kill them first.

1:14:35.708 --> 1:14:38.458
That candle is what's keeping them alive.

1:14:38.541 --> 1:14:41.375
It won't go out
until the sun rises, you dolt.

1:14:41.458 --> 1:14:43.166
Well, there's no need for name-calling.

1:14:45.291 --> 1:14:46.333
Cassie?

1:14:48.916 --> 1:14:52.000
-Oh, Gilbert. Impeccable timing.
-Hi.

1:14:52.083 --> 1:14:54.291
Hello, Billy.

1:14:54.375 --> 1:14:55.291
- Yes.

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:56.916
Hello, Billy.

1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.833
Hello, you withering hag.

1:15:01.666 --> 1:15:04.583
Well, if thou hast nothing nice to say...

1:15:07.541 --> 1:15:10.208
Good job, Winnie.
Now we have everything we need.

1:15:10.291 --> 1:15:12.541
No. Not everything.

1:15:12.625 --> 1:15:13.625
Not everything.

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:16.791
Book!

1:15:25.125 --> 1:15:26.541
There you are, my sweet.

1:15:26.625 --> 1:15:28.583
Wait, now you said
you need the blood of an enemy.

1:15:28.666 --> 1:15:30.666
But I mean, she's not your enemy.

1:15:30.750 --> 1:15:33.375
No. But she has our enemy's blood.

1:15:33.458 --> 1:15:36.083
-Ooh. That's gotta hurt.

1:15:36.791 --> 1:15:39.541
Okay, well, looks like
you've got everything you need,

1:15:39.625 --> 1:15:41.166
so I think you just

1:15:41.250 --> 1:15:42.541
-maybe let her go, okay?
-Sit and be comfy.

1:15:43.375 --> 1:15:47.000
That's a good idea, Gilbert,
but then, how would we torture her, huh?

1:15:51.041 --> 1:15:55.208
Now, thank you
for your assistance, Gilbert.

1:15:55.291 --> 1:15:58.500
But thou art now rendered redundant.

1:15:58.583 --> 1:16:00.291
Oh.

1:16:00.375 --> 1:16:01.416
Bye-bye.

1:16:03.916 --> 1:16:05.000
Should we?

1:16:05.208 --> 1:16:07.125
-No. Cassie.
-Cassie.

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:17.625
Reveal the incantation.

1:16:20.250 --> 1:16:21.500
Sisters.

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.625
I call upon this sacred land.

1:16:26.708 --> 1:16:28.625
-Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:16:28.708 --> 1:16:30.708
To raise the power in my hand.

1:16:30.791 --> 1:16:32.458
-Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:16:32.541 --> 1:16:34.625
From North, the East, the South, the West.

1:16:34.708 --> 1:16:36.583
-Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:16:36.666 --> 1:16:38.375
Give me more than I possess.

1:16:38.458 --> 1:16:40.291
-Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:16:40.375 --> 1:16:42.291
Underneath the full moon light.

1:16:42.375 --> 1:16:43.208
Ichita--

1:16:44.250 --> 1:16:47.041
I sacrifice my love tonight.

1:16:47.125 --> 1:16:49.666
And in return, I ask of thee.

1:16:49.750 --> 1:16:51.708
Magicae Maxima,

1:16:51.791 --> 1:16:54.458
give to me.

1:16:55.416 --> 1:16:57.625
- I call upon this sacred land.

1:16:57.708 --> 1:16:59.750
-Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:16:59.833 --> 1:17:01.166
- To raise the power...

1:17:02.208 --> 1:17:03.500
-- Itchita copita, melaka mystica.
-- Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:17:03.583 --> 1:17:06.291
From North, the East, the South, the West.

1:17:06.375 --> 1:17:07.583
-Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:17:07.666 --> 1:17:09.583
-Give me more than I possess.
-Okay.

1:17:09.666 --> 1:17:12.125
-Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:17:12.208 --> 1:17:13.333
Becca?

1:17:17.291 --> 1:17:18.916
- Hm-mm.

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.416
- Oh, my God.

1:17:21.833 --> 1:17:22.916
- How is it...

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.208
The salt in the Walgreen's,
the leaves in the basement,

1:17:25.291 --> 1:17:28.000
Cassie's house, 16th birthday.

1:17:28.083 --> 1:17:29.166
You're a witch.

1:17:29.916 --> 1:17:31.166
Doesn't make any sense.

1:17:31.250 --> 1:17:33.375
None of what's happened tonight
makes any sense.

1:17:35.166 --> 1:17:37.250
Okay, look, I'm sorry to have
to rush this very big,

1:17:37.333 --> 1:17:38.791
very pivotal moment in your life, but...

1:17:39.333 --> 1:17:42.041
do you think we could use your magic
to stop them and save Cassie?

1:17:44.333 --> 1:17:45.541
I guess we're gonna find out.

1:17:45.625 --> 1:17:47.208
Okay. Go get Cassie.

1:17:47.291 --> 1:17:48.291
Let's do this.

1:17:48.375 --> 1:17:49.958
-- Itchita copita, melaka mystica.
-- Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:17:50.041 --> 1:17:51.750
From North, the South, the East, the West.

1:17:51.833 --> 1:17:53.208
- Hey, Winifred!

1:17:59.875 --> 1:18:03.833
-Edward is a witch?
-I knew she smelled awful.

1:18:08.583 --> 1:18:13.916
This little witch against
the most powerful coven in history.

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.625
Sisters, who do you think is going to win?

1:18:16.708 --> 1:18:19.541
Let me see, could it be us?

1:18:20.250 --> 1:18:21.083
Ouch.

1:18:21.166 --> 1:18:24.208
Hey. She's got her own coven, you witch.

1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:29.416
-- Mayhem.
-- Oh, my hair. Winnie, oh!

1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:32.500
-- Oh, we are being attacked.
-- Got me in my oh, place.

1:18:32.583 --> 1:18:34.333
Heavens to Murgatroyd.

1:18:34.416 --> 1:18:35.458
Ow!

1:18:35.541 --> 1:18:37.500
-Stop it.
-Kill 'em, Winnie. Kill them.

1:18:44.916 --> 1:18:45.958
- I...

1:18:48.833 --> 1:18:51.750
I am suddenly powerful.

1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.000
Look, Winnie. Me too.

1:18:57.375 --> 1:18:59.875
- I, myself, am suddenly powerful.

1:18:59.958 --> 1:19:01.125
Look it.

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:03.250
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

1:19:03.333 --> 1:19:04.166
Ow.

1:19:06.333 --> 1:19:08.250
-- Look at me.
-Get out of here, go.

1:19:11.541 --> 1:19:13.416
Stop. Stop that.

1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:17.333
Stop dancing around, you fools.
Get them, get them.

1:19:21.125 --> 1:19:24.000
I beg your pardon?

1:19:24.083 --> 1:19:25.958
I am not a fool.

1:19:26.625 --> 1:19:32.125
I am a good and loyal sister,
and I expect to be seen as such.

1:19:33.166 --> 1:19:35.250
Ooh, she laid it down.

1:19:35.333 --> 1:19:38.416
-She's a good and loyal sister and she...
-Shut up and get going!

1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:39.875
Of course, Winnie. With pleasure.

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.666
-Go, go, go!
-Posthaste! As is your wanting.

1:19:41.750 --> 1:19:43.500
- I apologize for her. She can be...

1:19:44.416 --> 1:19:45.833
Don't get up.

1:19:52.291 --> 1:19:54.625
You don't want to do this spell.

1:19:54.708 --> 1:19:58.708
I know it may not feel like it,
but, you have a choice.

1:19:58.791 --> 1:20:01.333
And what choice would that be?

1:20:01.833 --> 1:20:03.000
I'm talking to the book.

1:20:15.500 --> 1:20:16.416
Book?

1:20:17.750 --> 1:20:21.250
No, no, no!

1:20:28.541 --> 1:20:31.041
-- Sisters!
-- There she is.

1:20:31.125 --> 1:20:33.583
Hi. Oh, Becca. You're okay.

1:20:33.666 --> 1:20:35.291
- I am so sorry.
I should have just told you.

1:20:35.375 --> 1:20:36.958
- No, I'm so sorry,
I shouldn't have assumed.

1:20:37.041 --> 1:20:38.375
-You're my best friend.
-No, no, no, but I was the one...

1:20:38.458 --> 1:20:40.125
- This is so sweet and I'm so happy
this is happening right now,

1:20:40.208 --> 1:20:41.416
but can we please figure out a plan?

1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:42.333
-- Right.
-- Right.

1:20:43.833 --> 1:20:46.250
Okay. Is there anything that we can do?

1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.125
-Uh, Magicae Maxima.

1:20:50.208 --> 1:20:52.166
No, no, no.
I'm not, I'm not like Winifred.

1:20:52.250 --> 1:20:55.041
I don't, I don't want to be all-powerful.
I just want to stop them, okay?

1:20:55.416 --> 1:20:57.458
I think it wants you to read the warning.

1:20:58.166 --> 1:20:59.875
Oh, the book is alive, by the way.

1:21:01.458 --> 1:21:02.375
Oh.

1:21:02.708 --> 1:21:05.083
"Beware the Power Spell
for it is most dangerous.

1:21:05.750 --> 1:21:07.541
Power is meant to be shared.

1:21:07.625 --> 1:21:10.000
To claim it all, a price must be paid.

1:21:11.083 --> 1:21:13.916
What is valued most dearly,
thou shall have to trade."

1:21:18.708 --> 1:21:20.291
What does she value most?

1:21:25.625 --> 1:21:26.625
Look out!

1:21:31.833 --> 1:21:35.583
Oh, sisters, observe.
She has a new parlor trick.

1:21:35.666 --> 1:21:37.291
Shall we have a little fun?

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.958
-Oh, I love fun.
-Like this.

1:21:40.041 --> 1:21:41.333
-Uh-huh.

1:21:50.208 --> 1:21:52.583
Power's meant to be shared.
Becca, give me your hand.

1:21:52.666 --> 1:21:54.125
I'm kinda in the middle
of something right now.

1:21:54.958 --> 1:21:58.166
Little witch,
you cannot hide from our power.

1:21:58.250 --> 1:21:59.833
Power is meant to be shared.

1:22:04.791 --> 1:22:07.000
- Becca, give me your hand. Come on.

1:22:10.625 --> 1:22:12.583
-Cassie, come on.
-Back up!

1:22:19.666 --> 1:22:23.333
Even with your sisters just as powerful
as you are, you still can't win.

1:22:23.416 --> 1:22:25.375
This is my spell.

1:22:25.458 --> 1:22:28.791
They are mere parasites,
leeches enjoying the spoils.

1:22:28.875 --> 1:22:32.000
I remain the most powerful one.

1:22:32.083 --> 1:22:35.750
You couldn't even finish the Power Spell.
And now it's too late.

1:22:35.833 --> 1:22:36.916
We have your Book.

1:22:40.083 --> 1:22:43.500
I do not need a book.

1:22:43.583 --> 1:22:47.458
Sisters, come,
we will complete the spell without Book.

1:22:47.541 --> 1:22:50.291
And once we do,
your inconsequential powers

1:22:50.375 --> 1:22:52.291
will not protect you
or your little friends

1:22:52.375 --> 1:22:55.333
or all of Salem from our wrath.

1:22:55.416 --> 1:22:58.833
-Sisters, away.
-Away.

1:23:01.166 --> 1:23:02.125
- I'm sorry.

1:23:05.208 --> 1:23:08.083
Did we... Did we just do magic?

1:23:13.250 --> 1:23:17.041
Wait, the warning.
I think I know how to stop them.

1:23:17.666 --> 1:23:19.541
-- We have to tell them.
-- Okay.

1:23:20.250 --> 1:23:23.541
SISTERS
Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:23:23.625 --> 1:23:26.791
Itchita copita, melaka mystica.

1:23:26.875 --> 1:23:27.958
Sisters.

1:23:31.250 --> 1:23:32.583
It's time.

1:23:33.041 --> 1:23:35.208
The final incantation.

1:23:36.333 --> 1:23:39.666
I call upon this sacred land.

1:23:39.750 --> 1:23:43.000
To raise the power in my hand.

1:23:43.083 --> 1:23:45.416
From North, South, East, and West.

1:23:45.500 --> 1:23:47.791
- Come on, we've got to stop them
before it's too late.

1:23:47.875 --> 1:23:49.750
-- Slow down, guys.
-- Come on, Cassie.

1:23:49.833 --> 1:23:55.666
Underneath this full moon light,
I sacrifice my love tonight.

1:23:55.750 --> 1:23:58.791
And in return, I ask of thee.

1:23:58.875 --> 1:24:04.875
Magicae Maxima, give to me!

1:24:27.500 --> 1:24:30.041
The candle. Sisters.

1:24:30.416 --> 1:24:32.666
The flame is out and yet...

1:24:33.375 --> 1:24:36.083
we are, still here.

1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.291
Good work, Winnie. Really.
I mean stellar work.

1:24:40.375 --> 1:24:42.083
-That's something else.
-Yes, beautiful work, Winnie.

1:24:42.166 --> 1:24:44.875
-Oh, I thank thee. I thank thee, sisters.
-This one.

1:24:44.958 --> 1:24:47.625
-Like...
-And now, we shall never die.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.500
And all Salem shall pay!

1:25:03.541 --> 1:25:05.041
- Madam, come here often?

1:25:05.125 --> 1:25:07.125
-May I?
-Delighted.

1:25:16.916 --> 1:25:18.500
Oh, look.

1:25:19.958 --> 1:25:21.500
Well, well, well.

1:25:24.750 --> 1:25:29.750
The little witch returns with her lackeys.
What dost thou want here?

1:25:29.833 --> 1:25:31.250
You should've read the warning.

1:25:31.333 --> 1:25:34.375
Why? What pearls
wouldst Book cast at my feet?

1:25:34.458 --> 1:25:35.750
I read none.

1:25:37.541 --> 1:25:38.416
The Power Spell?

1:25:39.875 --> 1:25:41.666
It takes what you value most.

1:25:41.750 --> 1:25:43.083
-Silence.
-Winnie.

1:25:43.166 --> 1:25:46.500
Thou aren't no witch.
Thou art nothing but a silly child.

1:25:46.583 --> 1:25:48.791
Thou knowest nothing.

1:25:48.875 --> 1:25:49.958
Winnie.

1:25:53.291 --> 1:25:54.500
Winnie?

1:25:56.041 --> 1:25:57.916
-No.
-The wind...

1:25:58.583 --> 1:26:00.375
is stealing my fingers.

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.500
-- Winnie.
-Sisters.

1:26:06.583 --> 1:26:09.916
'Tis over? Oh, no.

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000
Oh, Winnie, please.
Please don't, please don't forget us.

1:26:14.083 --> 1:26:17.958
Oh, and I know,
I know I was your favorite.

1:26:20.166 --> 1:26:22.375
Oh, stop. Stop, wait.

1:26:22.458 --> 1:26:24.291
Where art goest thou?

1:26:24.375 --> 1:26:27.375
Wait. Oh, please. Don't leave me.

1:26:27.958 --> 1:26:30.166
Art thou not coming with us?

1:26:38.166 --> 1:26:39.333
Oh.

1:26:39.458 --> 1:26:42.458
-Fare thee well, my sisters.
-Yes.

1:26:43.041 --> 1:26:47.875
Yes, and Winnie.
Sorrow is such sweet parting.

1:26:49.291 --> 1:26:50.916
Bye-bye.

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:52.375
Goodbye.

1:26:59.041 --> 1:27:02.000
Magicae Maxima, conversio.

1:27:03.250 --> 1:27:04.750
Rescind the spell.

1:27:10.041 --> 1:27:13.333
Undo what I have done. I beg of thee.

1:27:17.583 --> 1:27:19.583
They were the price you paid.

1:27:20.791 --> 1:27:22.125
Oh, not my sisters.

1:27:23.708 --> 1:27:26.375
My beloved, infuriating sisters?

1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:29.583
Why, they were my kin.

1:27:31.291 --> 1:27:34.500
Of course, I was the pretty one.

1:27:35.125 --> 1:27:38.333
But they were my passionate partners
in unholy mischief.

1:27:38.416 --> 1:27:40.541
Oh, what fun we had.

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:43.083
- Oh, Book.

1:27:44.625 --> 1:27:46.416
For old times' sake.

1:27:48.041 --> 1:27:49.416
Can nothing be done?

1:27:57.750 --> 1:28:00.250
My doing has been my undoing.

1:28:01.625 --> 1:28:04.708
My folly, my fate.

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:07.166
Oh, what is this feeling?

1:28:08.583 --> 1:28:10.000
Ooh.

1:28:10.166 --> 1:28:11.916
I think it is my heart.

1:28:12.791 --> 1:28:14.791
I fear it is breaking.

1:28:15.708 --> 1:28:17.708
Oh, I cannot bear it.

1:28:18.458 --> 1:28:19.833
I must find a way.

1:28:20.500 --> 1:28:22.208
My sisters, my sisters.

1:28:22.291 --> 1:28:23.958
-Book?
-- I must find a way.

1:28:31.208 --> 1:28:32.583
Thou art a new witch.

1:28:33.958 --> 1:28:37.500
Only a witch and her coven can manifest
what is written.

1:28:38.458 --> 1:28:41.000
Please will thou help me?

1:28:41.750 --> 1:28:43.833
Wait, you're willing to give up
your powers?

1:28:43.916 --> 1:28:46.208
My powers are nothing without my sisters.

1:28:47.833 --> 1:28:51.041
Becca. Book chose you.

1:28:52.125 --> 1:28:53.375
We're with you.

1:28:55.333 --> 1:28:59.458
-Okay. "The spell for reuniting."
-Okay.

1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.458
"Lost and gone and out of sight."

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.333
-"Ichita copita melaka mystica."

1:29:06.416 --> 1:29:08.416
-Okay.

1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:10.458
"We cast the spell to reunite."

1:29:10.541 --> 1:29:13.041
-"Ichita copita melaka mystica."

1:29:13.125 --> 1:29:16.833
"What is meant to be together,
will be now until forever."

1:29:22.666 --> 1:29:23.833
But...

1:29:25.208 --> 1:29:26.750
What, what happened? Where are they?

1:29:26.833 --> 1:29:29.041
Does thou speak the spell correctly?

1:29:33.041 --> 1:29:34.625
The spell doesn't bring them back.

1:29:35.708 --> 1:29:37.125
- It sends you to them.

1:29:52.208 --> 1:29:54.375
Oh, how marvelous.

1:29:57.375 --> 1:29:58.541
Thank thee.

1:29:59.250 --> 1:30:02.958
And how lucky art thou to have each other.

1:30:05.208 --> 1:30:07.833
Sisters.

1:30:45.375 --> 1:30:51.125
So are they gone, like gone, forever gone?

1:30:51.208 --> 1:30:56.375
Like, gone, as in, never, ever,
ever, ever coming back, right?

1:30:56.958 --> 1:30:57.958
Yeah, I guess...

1:30:58.041 --> 1:31:00.041
- Stop, Sanderson Sisters.

1:31:00.125 --> 1:31:02.625
Don't worry. We're here to help.

1:31:02.708 --> 1:31:03.958
Yeah, you're...

1:31:05.083 --> 1:31:06.291
you're a little late for that.

1:31:06.958 --> 1:31:07.958
They're gone?

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:10.833
Oh, thank God. Oh.

1:31:10.916 --> 1:31:13.166
-I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1:31:13.250 --> 1:31:15.458
I was like, my first move
was to come in bold,

1:31:15.541 --> 1:31:16.750
like, "Stop Sanderson Sisters,"

1:31:16.833 --> 1:31:18.375
and then, you know... No, yeah, oh.

1:31:18.458 --> 1:31:20.000
It's been like this the whole day.

1:31:20.083 --> 1:31:23.208
Over here,
you directionless skeleton sack.

1:31:23.291 --> 1:31:24.333
It talked.

1:31:24.416 --> 1:31:25.375
Oh.

1:31:27.875 --> 1:31:29.666
I can speak.

1:31:29.750 --> 1:31:33.000
Come on, buddy. Just bringing your...
your body to your head here.

1:31:33.125 --> 1:31:35.583
I am not speaking to you.
Now give me my bones.

1:31:38.583 --> 1:31:41.041
-Okay. Don't you drop me.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:31:41.125 --> 1:31:42.000
I won't.

1:31:43.333 --> 1:31:45.083
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Is he--

1:31:49.083 --> 1:31:51.375
-Tis about time.
-Yeah.

1:31:53.916 --> 1:31:56.625
Well, it would seem as though
their final destruction

1:31:56.708 --> 1:32:02.000
undoes all the spells of that
wretched troll, Winifred Sanderson.

1:32:02.875 --> 1:32:04.166
You're Billy Butcherson.

1:32:04.250 --> 1:32:05.791
Winifred's boyfriend.

1:32:05.875 --> 1:32:07.833
-Oh, my gosh, yes.
-Actually, no. Actually, no.

1:32:08.125 --> 1:32:09.458
-But, that's exactly what you told us.
-That's what you told us too, then.

1:32:09.541 --> 1:32:13.291
Nope. That is not the story,
and I'm gonna make sure

1:32:13.375 --> 1:32:14.833
everybody knows the truth, Billy.

1:32:15.750 --> 1:32:16.666
I promise.

1:32:19.833 --> 1:32:23.291
Thank you.
You're not nearly as vile as I thought.

1:32:24.083 --> 1:32:28.458
-Yeah.
-But now, I must bid you all goodnight.

1:32:29.291 --> 1:32:31.708
To my eternal rest.

1:32:31.791 --> 1:32:34.041
At last.

1:32:35.833 --> 1:32:37.375
-Sweet dreams.
-Goodnight.

1:32:38.958 --> 1:32:43.166
Becca, I owe you an apology.
Actually, I owe all of you an apology.

1:32:43.250 --> 1:32:44.375
You know, for...

1:32:45.416 --> 1:32:46.625
everything.

1:32:47.666 --> 1:32:48.750
You know what, Gilbert?

1:32:48.833 --> 1:32:50.333
It actually worked out pretty good.

1:32:51.125 --> 1:32:53.791
Just no more magic candles, deal?

1:32:54.916 --> 1:32:56.458
No candle, deal.

1:32:57.666 --> 1:33:01.666
Well, I guess I will take Book back,
you know, to the shop.

1:33:02.125 --> 1:33:03.541
Actually I think I'm gonna keep it.

1:33:03.625 --> 1:33:05.208
- Book could use a new home.

1:33:06.791 --> 1:33:10.041
Oh, it smiled, right?

1:33:10.791 --> 1:33:13.500
Okay. I guess I should check on Cobweb.

1:33:13.875 --> 1:33:15.333
He's seen a lot more action
than he's ever seen in his life,

1:33:15.416 --> 1:33:16.500
I'm sure he's scared poopless.

1:33:17.916 --> 1:33:18.750
Gilbert?

1:33:19.208 --> 1:33:20.291
What's up?

1:33:21.125 --> 1:33:22.000
We'll see you at the shop?

1:33:24.166 --> 1:33:25.125
Yes, you will.

1:33:25.833 --> 1:33:27.250
Discounts, discounts.

1:33:27.333 --> 1:33:28.875
-Oh, wow.
-Twenty percent off.

1:33:28.958 --> 1:33:30.708
Ten p... ten percent off.

1:33:32.583 --> 1:33:35.083
- So, what movie do you guys
want to watch tonight?

1:33:35.166 --> 1:33:37.416
Wait, sorry. Are we not gonna talk about
what just happened tonight?

1:33:37.500 --> 1:33:39.375
Because I feel like I missed a lot.

1:33:40.375 --> 1:33:43.125
Yeah. I guess if you consider
resurrecting evil witches,

1:33:43.208 --> 1:33:44.875
and then finding out your best friend
is a witch,

1:33:44.958 --> 1:33:47.375
and then helping her do a spell
to get rid of them

1:33:47.458 --> 1:33:51.125
as missing out, then, yeah,
totally missed out.

1:33:51.750 --> 1:33:53.875
Or, you know,
it's just your regular Halloween.

1:33:53.958 --> 1:33:55.666
-Oh, yeah, totally.

1:33:56.250 --> 1:33:57.500
- Do you think Susan
left those cookies out?

1:33:57.583 --> 1:33:58.583
- Oh, yeah. I'm starving.

1:33:58.666 --> 1:33:59.625
- Oh, me too.

1:33:59.708 --> 1:34:00.666
What a crazy day.

1:34:03.416 --> 1:34:07.125
-- Guys, guys, what are we doing?
-- I don't know.

1:34:08.416 --> 1:34:10.416
- What? Wait.
That's from the Walgreens.

1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:12.041
-That's the walk from the Walgreens.
-- Yes. So then what did they do?

1:34:12.125 --> 1:34:13.750
-- Oh, my God. Yes.
-- You do this.

1:34:22.875 --> 1:34:24.291
- Whoo!
