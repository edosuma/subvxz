It's too late, you didn't pick up.

It's her mother's engagement ring.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.520
…I hope you're not blaming
yourself for what happened…

21:24.040 --> 21:25.520
…to Chloe.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.760
What? Everyone says you had
something very special.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.840
So, what happened?

21:38.280 --> 21:42.040
Why the fuck are you asking?
Elliot has this crazy theory.

Sometimes he wonders
if that poster was meant for you.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.920
Did he say that?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.519
Did he?

22:08.520 --> 22:09.840
Fuck.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.359

22:30.280 --> 22:33.280
We used to smoke weed together
on Brandon Hill.

22:44.040 --> 22:48.040
I wasn't there for her.
I said I'd be there for her.

No… No, it's Becky.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.759
Erm, shit.

It's going to come back to me.

What school did you go to?

23:35.680 --> 23:38.359
Anyone else know a Becky Green?

23:38.360 --> 23:41.119
Chloe, do you know her?

23:41.120 --> 23:42.519
Elliot?

23:42.520 --> 23:45.520
Sorry, mate, sounds like
no-one knows you here.

Look, I'm sorry about Livia.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.679
I can't come to yours tonight.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.519
Sorry. This…

24:11.520 --> 24:13.439
It's all been a big mistake.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.040
Let's talk about this.
No. I shouldn't be here.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.519
I literally have no reason
to be here.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.079

I need to look after her.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.520
You are going to do
some revision today.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.119
I just spoke to Angela.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.600
What did she say? She said…

25:01.600 --> 25:04.280
…you need to stop
calling for Chloe.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.519

I should never have been there.

They all hate me now anyway.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.680
OK.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.279
Well, you can still move to Japan
or wherever.

27:12.280 --> 27:14.479
What the fuck am I going to do
in Japan?

27:14.480 --> 27:18.160
Whatever you want to do.
What's the point?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.280
Well…

27:27.520 --> 27:31.040
…a few years ago,
my mom got really sick…

27:32.040 --> 27:35.279
…and she decided not to tell me.

27:35.280 --> 27:40.039
She came up with this whole theory
that if everyone believed

27:40.040 --> 27:42.520
she was healthy,
she actually would be.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.120
So what…what are you
trying to say?

27:47.760 --> 27:49.520
It didn't work.

I didn't…

I didn't come here to talk.

No, it's just… It's my mum.

She was just quite bad this morning.
Oh.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.919
It can just throw her

32:11.920 --> 32:13.759
Oh, God, is it that bad?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.919

need to stop. Oh, well, I was

You need to come back now.
I can't find your mum.

What do you…? What do you mean?
Since when? I don't know.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.679
I've been looking everywhere
near the flat. She's not there.

34:36.680 --> 34:40.039
Where are you?
I've… I've been held up at work.

34:40.040 --> 34:43.679

come back and check the seafront.

Call me if you find her.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.759
Sorry, I… I've got to go.
Why? What's wrong?

34:51.760 --> 34:54.919
It's my mum. She's gone missing.
The carer can't find her.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.279
What?! Shit! Sasha, what can we do?

34:57.280 --> 35:01.399
Nothing, nothing. You don't… I'm
just going to go and look for her.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.879
OK. Listen, let me come with you.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.519
No, no. She's not good with new
people, she's not. Are you sure?

35:05.520 --> 35:08.439
Yeah, definitely. Maybe he should,
love. You can't just go on your own.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.119
No, no. It's fine. Honestly.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.159
That's just going to make things
worse. What can we do? Nothing.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.719
You don't need to do anything.
I need to go. I don't have my bag.

35:15.720 --> 35:18.439
Listen, where might she be? I mean,
I can call the council, they can

35:18.440 --> 35:21.919
look out for her. It'll be in the
Brandon Street… No, Glenwood Bay.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.959
Glenwood Bay? Er, yes… Er, yes,

35:23.960 --> 35:27.519
the carer's already looked around
ours. My mum sometimes gets on a

35:27.520 --> 35:29.039

35:29.040 --> 35:31.600
I'm going to go. Go, go.
Call us if you need us, OK?

It's nearly light and

36:39.680 --> 36:42.280
I need to open up. It's evening.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.119

You must be freezing.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.480
Come on. Excuse me!

36:56.480 --> 36:58.760
Have you heard of personal space?

37:00.040 --> 37:03.039
Right, OK, can you just
come with me, Mum, OK?

37:03.040 --> 37:04.760
Who are you?

37:06.520 --> 37:08.680
Because I don't understand.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.440
I can't remember.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.360
It's me.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.520

37:23.040 --> 37:25.760
Can we just go home, get warm?

37:28.800 --> 37:30.280
Yeah.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.040
Yeah.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.280
Let's go.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.039
That is up to the top, OK?

38:09.040 --> 38:11.839
I'm going to get you home.
Where? It's just over there.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.360
I'm going to drive us.
Just give me a minute, OK?

38:18.520 --> 38:20.280
INTERNAL RINGTONE

38:24.520 --> 38:28.279
Hello. I found her.
Oh, thank God. Yeah.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.039
Listen, would you mind
not doing a report?

38:31.040 --> 38:33.359
It's just, you know,
she's safe and sound

38:33.360 --> 38:36.039
and I am going to be there
for her now, I promise.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.759
I have to do a report, Becky.
That's my job.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.759
Yeah, well, I'm asking you not to.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.280
Sorry.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.440
Sasha?

38:50.760 --> 38:52.359
Stay in the car.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.039
What do you…? Are you OK?
Is your mum all right? Yeah.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.519
She's in… She's in there.
What are you doing?

38:57.520 --> 39:01.039
You, erm… You left your phone
and your house keys at Livia's.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.279
Thank you.
I thought you'd be locked out.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.199
I was going to go back
to Brandon Street

39:05.200 --> 39:07.759
but I thought I'd try the bus stop
one more time. Sorry.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.799
Don't apologise.
I'm just glad you're OK.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.560
Hello. I'm Elliot.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.759
Pam Green. Lovely to meet you.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.279
Come on, let's get back in the car.
Sasha's about to get you home.

39:19.280 --> 39:22.359
That's not Sasha. It's… It's me.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.760
Mum. No, you… Mum.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.680
Look at her hair.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.799
She can never get it to shine.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.679
It's a real shame for her.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.679
Well, now, now.
There's no need to be mean.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.920
She came here to take you home.

39:40.040 --> 39:43.520
Sasha, is this your fancy man?
Er…

39:44.520 --> 39:46.040
Er…

39:47.040 --> 39:49.040
She's my baby.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.760
You look after her. I'll be sure to.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.040
Come on. Come on.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.039
Thank… Thank you. Sorry.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.680
Don't… Just, sorry.
It's… Don't be.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.520
You had me worried.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

40:30.040 --> 40:32.040
I don't care if it's too soon.

40:33.520 --> 40:36.039
I don't care if people
think it's a mistake.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.039
It's more than that. What, then?

40:38.040 --> 40:40.759
I fucked up.
She could have been really hurt.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.520
It's not your fault.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.439
I had no idea that it was…

40:47.440 --> 40:49.040
…this bad.

40:50.280 --> 40:53.039
You're surely not doing
this by yourself. No.

40:53.040 --> 40:56.279
We… We have a carer who
comes for an hour a day

40:56.280 --> 40:58.520
but it's not enough. That's crazy.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.040
It's too much for you to deal with.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.519
I mean, have you thought
about a home?

41:06.520 --> 41:10.039
Yeah. My grandpa spent a few years
at Dudley Manor.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.839
He had a great time.

41:11.840 --> 41:15.039
Have you thought about it seriously?
But it's expensive.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.759
It's… There's…
It's a huge waiting list.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.960
Can I…? I just…
I need to get her home.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.039
Sasha, wait. Yeah?

41:24.040 --> 41:26.959
Look, let me make a few phone calls.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.759
We made a big donation to
Dudley Manor after Grandpa died.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.679
I'm sure they'd be happy to help.
No, no. El, that's… No.

41:32.680 --> 41:35.279
But I just want to help.
I know. I know you do.

41:35.280 --> 41:39.040
Erm, you…
You don't really know me.

41:40.520 --> 41:43.040
That's just not a good idea.
Why not?

41:46.040 --> 41:47.519
Livia's right.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.520
We need to stop this now
or you're just going to get hurt.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.760
It's a bit late for that.

41:56.760 --> 42:00.040
Look, take each day as it comes.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.040
Put her in there for now,
see how it goes.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.760
You can't put your life on hold.

42:11.040 --> 42:14.040
I should go. Go. Drive safe.

42:28.280 --> 42:29.840
Sorry, Mum.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.440
What for?

42:44.880 --> 42:48.160
PAM HUMS A MELODY

42:57.520 --> 43:00.959
Shall I do your back?
SHE CONTINUES HUMMING

43:00.960 --> 43:02.520
Lovely.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.440
SHE CONTINUES HUMMING

43:18.800 --> 43:20.520
You're good to me.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.519
A bit there.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.279
Fuck…you!

43:27.280 --> 43:29.040
THEY LAUGH

43:37.040 --> 43:38.920
God, I'm tired.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.039
You need an early night.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.280
I think I need more than that.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.759
Dug myself into a bit of a hole.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.519
Really?

43:50.520 --> 43:51.920
Yeah.

43:53.280 --> 43:56.040
I know I need to get out of it
but I don't know…

43:59.040 --> 44:02.040
It just… It just feels good, Mum.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.280
Love, you and me…

44:08.280 --> 44:10.879
…we never get to pick and choose.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.760
We have to make the most
of what we're given.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.360
Yeah.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.040
I could ride it out for a bit.

44:24.040 --> 44:25.920
See how long it can last.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.679
Make the most of it.

44:29.680 --> 44:31.519
You'll be all right.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.679
No, I can't.

44:33.680 --> 44:37.400
You're beautiful, clever and kind.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.040
The holy trinity.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.360
Just like Chloe.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.920
Who's Chloe?

44:52.480 --> 44:55.760
PAM HUMS

44:59.040 --> 45:01.760
I thought she was trying
to reach out to me.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.280
I can't believe I thought that.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.279
BABY CRIES

45:12.280 --> 45:14.039
FOOTSTEPS

45:14.040 --> 45:16.759
What's that? That's just next door.

45:16.760 --> 45:18.359
BABY CRIES

45:18.360 --> 45:21.279
No, it's not.
It is. It is, I promise.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.439
Sasha… Mum. …where's your sister?

45:23.440 --> 45:26.520
Look, I'll get you a towel.
Where's Sasha? Mum.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.040
Where's your sister? She's dead,
Mum! She's dead! She died!

45:36.520 --> 45:39.720
BECKY CRIES
What have you done? I'm sorry.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.760
What have you done?

45:50.040 --> 45:52.040
What have you done?

45:58.760 --> 46:00.040
Sorry.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.280
Sorry?

46:05.560 --> 46:08.959
Sorry. Don't touch me!
Fuck! Get out!

46:08.960 --> 46:10.920
Get out! I don't want you here!

46:12.040 --> 46:14.040
I never wanted you here!

46:22.080 --> 46:25.720
INTENSE BUBBLING

46:54.040 --> 46:55.280
Hey.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.040
Is everything all right?

46:59.520 --> 47:01.040
Hey. Hey, hey.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.040
What's going on?

47:34.760 --> 47:36.280
I… Hey.

47:39.520 --> 47:41.280
Don't worry about it.

47:42.280 --> 47:43.760
I'm sorry.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.040
Mm-mm. Mm…

48:04.280 --> 48:06.120
Let's just go to sleep.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.919
SHE KNOCKS

49:21.920 --> 49:23.680
Morning. Morning.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.480
Right…

49:37.480 --> 49:39.320
…I've been thinking.

49:40.520 --> 49:44.480
I've found you a great place
to stay for a bit. For a bit.

49:45.480 --> 49:48.279
It's really nice.
You're trying to palm me off.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.759
No.

49:49.760 --> 49:52.039
No. No, I'm not.

49:52.040 --> 49:56.760
Right. It's just for a bit and then
I will be there for you…properly.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.760
Mum, I promise.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.839
I called them already.

50:32.840 --> 50:35.279
They can do you an amazing deal.

50:35.280 --> 50:39.519
I've paid for the first month
and we'll figure it out after that.

50:39.520 --> 50:41.279
Thank you.

50:41.280 --> 50:44.040
I will pay you back.
We'll figure it out.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.279
El, I need to talk to Livia.

50:49.280 --> 50:53.199
We will, but it's not a good idea
just yet. No, I have to.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.519
Look, honestly, trust me.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.279
I know her.

50:57.280 --> 51:01.519
Just let the dust settle,
let her get over herself.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.040
OK.

51:06.040 --> 51:08.039
How are your chopping skills?

51:08.040 --> 51:09.520
Excellent.

51:11.040 --> 51:12.959
That's what I like to hear. OK.
There you go.

51:12.960 --> 51:16.760
SHE LAUGHS
Tiny knife, tiny hands…

51:17.760 --> 51:19.519
…and apron.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.040
Here.

51:22.040 --> 51:24.040
Thank you. Turn around.

51:28.280 --> 51:31.079
So, erm, tight enough?

51:31.080 --> 51:32.519
It's great.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.399
Rich is getting out tomorrow

51:34.400 --> 51:40.040
and I think, as a group, we ought
to spend a bit more time with him.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.520
Yes.

51:44.040 --> 51:46.519
RICHARD IN VOICEOVER: I've
definitely met you before.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.279
School or something.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.760
Erm…

51:51.520 --> 51:55.760
El, I've, erm…
I've been thinking…about that.

51:58.760 --> 52:02.520
Do you think he could have
done it on purpose?

52:05.280 --> 52:08.279
God, erm, I… I don't know.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.759
Maybe.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.840
What? Has it happened before?

52:12.840 --> 52:16.439
Well, I mean, he's had his stomach
pumped when he was a teenager.

52:16.440 --> 52:19.000
So, how often does he get wasted?

52:20.000 --> 52:21.680
Quite a lot.

52:22.680 --> 52:25.320
It's just, my friend, Alex…

52:26.320 --> 52:29.279
…you know, we all thought of her
as the wild party girl,

52:29.280 --> 52:32.040
and from one point of view
she was…

52:33.040 --> 52:35.280
…but then you look at it
the other way.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.000
Erm, you're right.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.119
Yeah. I just…
I just think he needs help.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.919
Proper help. Urgently.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.279
No, no.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.680
No, you're absolutely right.

52:52.120 --> 52:55.279
There are some good places.
You know, mental health

52:55.280 --> 52:57.800
and addiction facilities,
if he'd be willing.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.919
God, you're amazing.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.360
I've got garlic all over my…
It's fine.

53:18.520 --> 53:21.040
Come on, or else we'll never eat.

53:52.160 --> 53:54.040
PHONE VIBRATES

53:58.120 --> 54:01.279
You're just a fucking loser creep.
Stop calling me! I told you to stop.
