WEBVTT

00:24.820 --> 00:27.475
Well, listen, no rush, but, uh...

00:27.476 --> 00:29.561
do you think our little
project's gonna be finished

00:29.562 --> 00:30.980
anytime soon?

00:36.944 --> 00:37.944
Finished.

00:37.945 --> 00:39.947
Ah.

00:40.948 --> 00:43.241
Oh, it's so simple and clean, isn't it?

00:43.242 --> 00:45.536
I love boxes.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.850
Is that a weird thing to say?

00:48.853 --> 00:50.955
Is that a weird thing to say?

00:50.958 --> 00:53.293
Felt pretty weird when I said it.

00:53.294 --> 00:54.794
Listen, relax.

00:54.795 --> 00:56.671
Signore, you've done your job.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.298
My organization appreciates

00:58.299 --> 01:00.842
all the hard work you've done, but...

01:00.843 --> 01:02.636
I'm getting one of my ideas.

01:04.430 --> 01:06.639
I think we should have a demonstration.

01:06.642 --> 01:08.603
Don't you?

01:10.686 --> 01:12.353
Who's this little darling?

01:12.354 --> 01:15.214
That's my baby Stella.

01:15.217 --> 01:17.483
Please. Please don't hurt her.

01:17.484 --> 01:18.860
I'll do anything.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.486
I'll do anything, please.

01:22.730 --> 01:23.948
Ah!

01:23.949 --> 01:26.409
My God, I'd never hurt a rabbit.

01:26.410 --> 01:29.160
What do you think I
am, some kind of sicko?

01:29.163 --> 01:31.331
I despise cruelty to animals.

01:31.334 --> 01:33.386
I'm still trying to get
this one to go vegan,

01:33.389 --> 01:35.501
but she's from the
wrong side of Budapest...

01:35.502 --> 01:37.338
Do you know Budapest?

01:37.341 --> 01:38.511
Doesn't matter.

01:38.514 --> 01:39.946
So you were saying

01:39.949 --> 01:41.992
that the range of this thing

01:41.995 --> 01:45.488
without the antenna is
a, is a hundred meters.

01:45.491 --> 01:47.688
Now,

01:47.691 --> 01:50.113
now I'm wondering if that's true.

01:52.392 --> 01:53.809
Please. Please.

01:53.812 --> 01:55.980
Don't.

01:57.358 --> 01:59.211
Kristina, what are you doing?

01:59.214 --> 02:02.331
You were supposed to let him
get to the postbox outside.

02:02.334 --> 02:04.109
So we could test the range?

02:04.112 --> 02:05.894
Now I've got questions, haven't I?

02:05.897 --> 02:07.355
Ah.

02:07.358 --> 02:09.901
All right, clean this up.

02:09.905 --> 02:12.574
Yes, and I'm very sorry
about your father, dear,

02:12.577 --> 02:13.911
but, uh...

02:13.914 --> 02:16.035
but he was a witness.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.456
Oh.

02:37.358 --> 02:42.597
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:47.241 --> 02:49.253
Right. Tell me what it is you see.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.700
A middle-aged British guy

02:50.703 --> 02:52.089
who maybe slept in his clothes

02:52.092 --> 02:53.926
and definitely didn't shower.

02:53.929 --> 02:56.375
Incorrect and unnecessarily hurtful.

02:56.378 --> 02:58.084
Actually, I didn't sleep.

02:58.085 --> 02:59.877
Saving the world requires sacrifice.

02:59.878 --> 03:02.128
Of personal hygiene?

03:02.131 --> 03:03.464
It's a cryptograph.

03:03.465 --> 03:05.091
Yes. Thank you.

03:05.092 --> 03:07.745
A substitution cipher

03:07.748 --> 03:09.415
where almost every symbol

03:09.418 --> 03:12.932
is a variation of the
astronomical symbol for "Earth."

03:12.933 --> 03:14.683
- It's how they communicate.
- Who?

03:14.686 --> 03:17.393
The people who infiltrated
NORAD and tried to contaminate

03:17.396 --> 03:18.771
L.A.'s water supply.

03:18.772 --> 03:20.285
They have a name now.

03:20.288 --> 03:21.205
Codex.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.792
Yes. Codex.

03:22.795 --> 03:24.618
For months I've been intercepting

03:24.621 --> 03:25.830
bits of their communications,

03:25.833 --> 03:28.126
arcane symbols, running a cryptanalysis,

03:28.129 --> 03:29.629
until finally, last night,

03:29.632 --> 03:31.033
their words began to
appear in my head...

03:31.035 --> 03:33.286
not many but enough...

03:33.287 --> 03:35.105
and I realized

03:35.108 --> 03:37.282
we don't have to wait
here like sitting ducks

03:37.285 --> 03:38.291
for the next attack.

03:38.292 --> 03:39.584
We can actually go on the offensive

03:39.585 --> 03:41.337
and hit them where it hurts.

03:42.338 --> 03:43.796
Their wallet.

03:43.797 --> 03:46.466
An organization with
their kind of global reach

03:46.467 --> 03:47.842
can't function without money.

03:47.843 --> 03:49.177
It's a smart move.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.305
Thank you, Matilda.

03:50.308 --> 03:51.763
You're welcome, Russell.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.664
What is this?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.475
We're trying to be nice.

03:55.476 --> 03:56.809
I'm already over it.

03:56.810 --> 03:58.311
Okay, I'm going to guess that

03:58.312 --> 04:00.104
Codex has a few
different funding sources.

04:00.105 --> 04:02.273
- Arms deals, extortion, drugs.
- Yes.

04:02.274 --> 04:04.081
But we only need one to start.

04:04.818 --> 04:06.152
It involves a man

04:06.153 --> 04:09.280
known only as...

04:09.281 --> 04:10.615
The Merchant,

04:10.618 --> 04:12.706
whose identity is unknown,

04:12.709 --> 04:14.919
an illegal gambling den,

04:14.922 --> 04:16.369
Milan, Italy...

04:16.372 --> 04:17.373
...and...

04:20.834 --> 04:22.835
...this.

04:22.836 --> 04:25.630
I think we might be
inside of Taylor's brain.

04:25.631 --> 04:27.344
Actually, I-I think I get this.

04:27.347 --> 04:30.176
Codex is using match-fixing
as a source of funding.

04:30.177 --> 04:32.011
They're paying people
to throw soccer games?

04:32.012 --> 04:33.721
It's actually called football, darling,

04:33.722 --> 04:35.446
and, uh, we invented the game, but, yes,

04:35.449 --> 04:37.144
The Merchant places large bets

04:37.147 --> 04:38.897
on football matches.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.318
Then he recruits corrupt
players to throw those matches

04:41.321 --> 04:42.780
in his favor,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.522
thereby earning millions in winnings.

04:44.525 --> 04:45.566
Millions

04:45.569 --> 04:46.872
that go toward future attacks

04:46.875 --> 04:48.363
and the death of innocent civilians.

04:48.366 --> 04:50.071
Based on my intel, we know The Merchant

04:50.072 --> 04:51.531
gets many of his football players

04:51.534 --> 04:54.399
from Milan's top football
team, R.S. Milano.

04:54.402 --> 04:56.202
So if we find one of
these corrupt players,

04:56.203 --> 04:57.495
- we find The Merchant.
- All right.

04:57.496 --> 04:58.789
There's, like, 30 players on a team,

04:58.791 --> 05:00.001
so how do we figure
out which are corrupt?

05:00.003 --> 05:02.360
I think I know how we can
find the corrupt players.

05:02.363 --> 05:03.821
It's called sports analytics.

05:03.824 --> 05:05.044
We can Moneyball it.

05:05.045 --> 05:07.534
So, most pro team statistics...
they're proprietary.

05:07.537 --> 05:09.997
However, Riley can
hack whatever we need.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.426
We then write an algorithm,

05:11.427 --> 05:13.925
assign values to aspects
of players' performance.

05:13.928 --> 05:15.387
We then use that

05:15.390 --> 05:17.331
to see if how they should perform

05:17.334 --> 05:19.710
matches how they
actually are performing.

05:19.713 --> 05:20.959
That should narrow it down.

05:20.962 --> 05:22.630
The team's hosting a big charity event

05:22.632 --> 05:24.633
two days before the Finals match.

05:24.636 --> 05:26.095
If my intel is correct,

05:26.098 --> 05:28.605
that's where The Merchant
will meet his player.

05:28.608 --> 05:29.691
And we'll be there, too.

05:29.694 --> 05:31.902
Tail the player to The Merchant,

05:31.905 --> 05:33.495
take The Merchant into custody,

05:33.498 --> 05:34.438
shut down millions

05:34.441 --> 05:35.992
in funding for Codex.

05:35.993 --> 05:37.511
If we're tailing players,

05:37.514 --> 05:39.503
we need unrestricted access.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.847
Someone on the inside.

05:40.850 --> 05:42.684
Maybe someone on the team.

05:42.687 --> 05:44.856
I think I know the perfect person.

05:50.771 --> 05:52.230
I'm so gonna murder you.

05:52.233 --> 05:54.276
She also used to be a
starting player at Michigan.

05:54.279 --> 05:56.696
Senior year, three
goals in the Finals, MVP.

05:56.699 --> 05:57.597
How do you know that?

05:57.598 --> 05:58.606
I don't even remember telling you.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.699
Yeah, you didn't.

05:59.702 --> 06:01.516
You used to have a
recurring dream about it.

06:01.519 --> 06:03.378
Crowd was cheering
you on and everything.

06:03.381 --> 06:04.839
Used to talk about it in your sleep,

06:04.842 --> 06:05.962
a little smile on your face.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.394
Found her college photo.

06:08.397 --> 06:10.206
How do you

06:10.209 --> 06:11.376
still have braces?

06:11.379 --> 06:12.943
I didn't wear my retainer, Bozer.

06:12.946 --> 06:14.519
Can we get back to work, please?

06:14.522 --> 06:16.089
Right. This is how it'll go down.

06:17.637 --> 06:19.950
I'll use my connections
to get you on the team

06:19.953 --> 06:21.204
as a fourth-string benchwarmer.

06:21.205 --> 06:24.081
You've got enough skills
to fake that for a while.

06:28.274 --> 06:30.066
I'll create your bona fides online

06:30.069 --> 06:31.921
using a defunct team in Belarus.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.706
If Team Milano wants to check up on you,

06:33.709 --> 06:35.610
by the time they track anyone down,

06:35.613 --> 06:37.303
we'll be on a jet back home.

06:37.304 --> 06:38.262
And we can deepfake you

06:38.263 --> 06:39.519
into some game footage.

06:39.522 --> 06:41.399
I did it on my last
movie with Judi Dench

06:41.402 --> 06:42.642
and a sock puppet.

06:42.643 --> 06:44.605
And... cut.

06:44.608 --> 06:46.145
I'm also gonna throw in a little

06:46.146 --> 06:49.440
online presence... give
you a personal backstory.

06:49.441 --> 06:51.943
Can I have a Spanish boyfriend?

06:51.944 --> 06:54.404
And a French girlfriend?

06:55.409 --> 06:57.949
Right. Just a quick
run-through of the basics.

06:57.952 --> 07:01.914
Kicking the ball with your
instep, arm in the air.

07:03.011 --> 07:05.013
Let's see what you've got.

07:08.335 --> 07:10.292
You mean like this?

07:10.295 --> 07:12.004
Yes. Yes, that's, uh...

07:12.005 --> 07:13.297
yeah, it's rather good.

07:13.298 --> 07:15.519
Why don't we just save it for Milan?

07:15.522 --> 07:16.715
Very good.

07:29.671 --> 07:31.839
Sophia. Sophia.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.360
I think I'm actually
getting the hang of this,

07:34.361 --> 07:35.861
being a paparazzi.

07:35.862 --> 07:37.863
It's paparazzo, singular.

07:37.864 --> 07:38.990
Don't embarrass me.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.993
No need. Your outfit is
doing all the work for me.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.369
It's called dressing for the part.

07:43.370 --> 07:45.191
I'm a rich and charitable donor.

07:45.194 --> 07:46.777
I'll take one of those.

07:46.780 --> 07:48.081
Bozer, please.

07:48.084 --> 07:49.793
You're meant to be Desi's manager.

07:49.796 --> 07:51.377
I'm testing the food for my client.

07:51.378 --> 07:52.683
Uh, excuse me, miss?

07:52.686 --> 07:54.228
Do that again

07:54.231 --> 07:56.024
and I hack your Tinder account.

07:56.027 --> 07:58.382
You have way too much power.

07:58.385 --> 08:01.679
Signore e signori, R.S. Milano.

08:05.058 --> 08:06.321
Kristy Le!

08:06.324 --> 08:07.902
This is so insane.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.393
Why do I feel like I'm about to puke?

08:10.397 --> 08:13.011
This is probably the
biggest con you've ever done

08:13.014 --> 08:15.558
and quite possibly your
cover will be blown,

08:15.561 --> 08:17.371
in which case we'll all
incur the murderous wrath

08:17.373 --> 08:19.667
of a nasty terrorist organization

08:19.670 --> 08:22.283
who will have no problem
taking out innocent civilians

08:22.284 --> 08:24.994
who get in the way as they
hunt us across the globe.

08:24.995 --> 08:26.704
So pep talks aren't your thing.

08:26.705 --> 08:28.336
Right. Break a leg.

08:28.339 --> 08:30.416
Or not.

08:30.417 --> 08:32.961
No turning back now.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.520
What's the sitrep with
our suspect players?

08:43.524 --> 08:45.326
Any sign of a meeting with The Merchant?

08:45.327 --> 08:46.869
That's a negative on the meeting.

08:46.872 --> 08:48.916
Still have visual on
all the targets, though.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.521
They're just schmoozing on the field.

08:50.524 --> 08:52.542
Together. Yes.

08:55.712 --> 08:57.755
My player's on the move.

09:05.722 --> 09:07.664
Hi, nice to meet you.

09:12.187 --> 09:13.729
She's headed inside.

09:13.730 --> 09:15.482
I'll stay with her.

09:16.733 --> 09:18.567
We're outside the locker room.

09:18.568 --> 09:20.194
She's upset about something.

09:20.195 --> 09:21.404
We've got no leads.

09:21.405 --> 09:22.863
Get us some intel.

09:22.864 --> 09:24.224
Comfort her.

09:24.227 --> 09:27.410
Make some eye contact,
soften your voice.

09:27.411 --> 09:29.413
Okay.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.209
Is that your family?

09:43.218 --> 09:45.886
Si.

09:45.887 --> 09:48.764
Sorry, do you want something?

09:48.765 --> 09:52.268
No, you... you just seem upset.

09:52.269 --> 09:53.484
I'm fine.

09:53.487 --> 09:54.935
She doesn't want to talk.

09:54.938 --> 09:58.114
Forget comfort, ask for
help. Appear vulnerable.

09:58.117 --> 09:59.775
Make it seem real.

09:59.776 --> 10:01.235
Um...

10:01.236 --> 10:03.904
Sometimes I miss my family so much,

10:03.905 --> 10:05.961
I think I'm gonna lose my mind.

10:14.958 --> 10:18.461
My parents risked their
lives getting us to America.

10:18.462 --> 10:20.463
Sacrificed everything.

10:20.464 --> 10:23.414
Mine, too. They worked

10:23.417 --> 10:25.632
day and night, always exhausted,

10:25.635 --> 10:27.595
so that I could have my dream.

10:27.596 --> 10:29.203
Yeah.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.808
Get up and walk away.

10:32.809 --> 10:35.406
Act embarrassed.

10:35.409 --> 10:36.979
Trust me.

10:36.980 --> 10:41.317
I'm sorry. I can tell
you want to be alone.

10:41.318 --> 10:44.862
Wait. I'm sure your parents

10:44.863 --> 10:47.156
are very proud of you.

10:47.157 --> 10:50.159
I'm sure yours are, too.

10:51.844 --> 10:53.621
They're not.

10:53.622 --> 10:55.373
I know they're not.

10:55.374 --> 10:57.333
I messed everything up.

10:57.334 --> 10:59.044
What happened?

11:01.713 --> 11:05.674
It's an invitation to an exclusive club.

11:05.677 --> 11:07.930
It's a gambling club.

11:08.662 --> 11:10.386
All it took was one night

11:10.389 --> 11:12.681
for me to ruin my entire life.

11:12.682 --> 11:14.850
And now I am someone that my parents

11:14.851 --> 11:18.020
will always be ashamed of.

11:18.021 --> 11:20.523
So you made a mistake.

11:20.524 --> 11:22.813
Your parents must know
that's not who you are.

11:24.526 --> 11:25.984
You're right.

11:25.987 --> 11:27.813
It's not who I am,

11:27.816 --> 11:29.818
and it's not who I want to be.

11:32.243 --> 11:34.370
I'll see you at the scrimmage.

11:35.787 --> 11:38.330
And, uh...

11:38.333 --> 11:39.626
thank you.

11:42.003 --> 11:43.856
I want all eyes on Gabriella.

11:43.859 --> 11:45.714
That type of financial distress

11:45.715 --> 11:48.592
makes her a perfect
target for manipulation.

11:48.593 --> 11:50.720
We're in the VIP section.

11:50.721 --> 11:52.931
I can't get any closer
without drawing attention.

11:55.598 --> 11:59.109
Well, looks like she led
us straight to The Merchant.

11:59.112 --> 12:00.396
Got any sort of I.D.

12:00.397 --> 12:01.689
on this guy, Matty?

12:01.690 --> 12:04.066
No, but

12:04.067 --> 12:06.914
he's surrounded himself with
enough European dignitaries

12:06.917 --> 12:07.958
to fill the U.N.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.555
If it is him, he's smart.
We can't grab him there,

12:10.558 --> 12:12.731
not without creating an
international incident.

12:12.734 --> 12:15.110
- Well, I'm game to give it a try.
- Taylor, cool it.

12:15.113 --> 12:17.573
You need better confirmation
if we're gonna arrest him

12:17.576 --> 12:18.910
on any sort of authority.

12:18.913 --> 12:20.747
Riley, I need ears on that conversation.

12:20.750 --> 12:23.043
I'm on it.

12:23.044 --> 12:24.786
Riley, we can't hear over the music.

12:24.789 --> 12:26.456
- Get closer.
- If you want me to get

12:26.459 --> 12:28.313
any closer, I'll be sitting on his lap.

12:30.465 --> 12:32.891
I need your mic. Hand it off to Bozer.

12:44.107 --> 12:46.900
Sound travels in waves,
and when those waves

12:46.903 --> 12:49.864
hit the sloped inner wall
of a parabolic dish...

12:49.867 --> 12:51.574
or a trash can lid...

12:51.577 --> 12:53.724
they'll bounce back
to a focused position,

12:53.727 --> 12:55.767
and that's where you put your mic.

12:55.770 --> 12:59.231
All right, I got it. You
should hear it on comms.

12:59.234 --> 13:00.896
Whatever this is about,

13:00.899 --> 13:02.583
this really isn't the right
place or the right time.

13:02.585 --> 13:03.795
We can discuss anything later...

13:03.797 --> 13:05.494
No, it's not up for discussion.

13:05.495 --> 13:07.255
I'm done with this arrangement.

13:07.258 --> 13:09.331
Look, obviously, you're rather upset.

13:09.332 --> 13:11.458
What I suggest you do
is take a deep breath

13:11.459 --> 13:12.876
and think about good things,

13:12.879 --> 13:15.075
like sunshine and bunny rabbits

13:15.078 --> 13:16.664
and your family.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.661
I am thinking about my family.

13:18.664 --> 13:22.302
I want to be able to go home
and look them in the eyes.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.614
Normally, I'd say let's
sleep on it, but, uh,

13:24.617 --> 13:27.695
we've got a match coming
up and you made a deal.

13:29.758 --> 13:31.759
I really hate confrontation.
It really stresses...

13:31.762 --> 13:33.389
I've made my decision.

13:38.027 --> 13:40.571
Fascinating that you
think you have a choice.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.614
It's confirmed. He's our man.

13:42.615 --> 13:44.825
We'll take him during the scrimmage.

13:49.368 --> 13:51.370
- Everyone in position?
- Affirmative.

14:04.507 --> 14:06.509
She's dead.

14:08.719 --> 14:10.927
Merchant's on the
move. You take him now.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.689
Can't see him.

14:15.318 --> 14:16.521
He's gone.

14:16.524 --> 14:18.359
No, no, no.

14:19.611 --> 14:21.069
Did you double-check

14:21.070 --> 14:22.613
the stadium parking structure cameras?

14:22.614 --> 14:25.407
Triple-checked. Nothing.
The Merchant's in the wind.

14:25.408 --> 14:27.743
No, we just haven't figured
out where to look yet.

14:27.744 --> 14:30.586
Russ, when was the last time
you had a good night's sleep?

14:30.589 --> 14:34.286
Oh. 1994, after a lovely
massage in Granada.

14:34.289 --> 14:36.203
Riley, did you get any contact

14:36.206 --> 14:38.047
from the team about what
happened to Gabriella?

14:38.050 --> 14:40.444
Nothing. I found the hospital
where her body was taken,

14:40.447 --> 14:42.614
but the morgue and EMT
records have been wiped clean.

14:42.617 --> 14:44.760
Codex is certainly
covering their tracks.

14:44.761 --> 14:47.390
Yeah, I checked every photo I
took. I've got no leads either.

14:47.393 --> 14:48.518
I don't know how,

14:48.521 --> 14:50.273
but The Merchant killed her.

14:52.461 --> 14:54.462
She was just trying
to do the right thing.

14:54.465 --> 14:55.497
I don't get it.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.117
The Finals match is in two days.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.233
The Merchant needed
Gabriella to throw the game.

14:59.234 --> 15:00.888
Well, he'll just find another player.

15:00.891 --> 15:02.903
Then let's make it easy for him.

15:02.904 --> 15:04.780
If he wants a corruptible player,

15:04.788 --> 15:07.958
let's give him one. Me.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.508
We put on a show, make
him think I'm corruptible,

15:12.511 --> 15:13.844
set a meeting.

15:13.847 --> 15:17.600
He takes the bait, we take him down.

15:17.603 --> 15:20.891
Then we'd better make sure he
doesn't take down Desi with him.

15:27.273 --> 15:29.066
Invitations to the private gambling club

15:29.067 --> 15:30.942
where Gabriella lost all of her money.

15:30.943 --> 15:31.985
How did you swing that?

15:31.986 --> 15:33.612
Oh, you know, posh accent,

15:33.613 --> 15:35.781
emotional manipulation, blackmail.

15:35.782 --> 15:37.324
Same way I got my first wife.

15:37.325 --> 15:40.577
Thanks to security
cameras at the villa gates,

15:40.578 --> 15:41.578
we know The Merchant

15:41.579 --> 15:44.748
sent a car for Gabriella
after she hit bottom.

15:44.751 --> 15:47.128
It's a nice little
setup for him, actually.

15:48.751 --> 15:52.128
A one-stop shop for
recruiting desperate players.

15:52.131 --> 15:54.217
He'll need a man on
the inside, of course,

15:54.220 --> 15:55.800
to be his eyes and ears.

15:55.801 --> 15:59.179
He'll probably use the
club manager for that.

15:59.180 --> 16:01.165
The manager alerts The Merchant,

16:01.168 --> 16:02.724
The Merchant then approaches the players

16:02.725 --> 16:05.759
and graciously offers to erase
all of their gambling debt

16:05.762 --> 16:07.721
in return for fixing matches.

16:07.724 --> 16:09.979
Desi, since you're the
bait, you'll be doing

16:09.982 --> 16:11.983
the gambling and losing,
just like Gabriella.

16:11.984 --> 16:14.626
The rest of us can pose as
gamblers and help Desi out

16:14.629 --> 16:15.964
at the tables and make sure everybody

16:15.966 --> 16:17.278
knows that she's a big loser.

16:17.281 --> 16:18.884
That-that, uh,

16:18.887 --> 16:21.221
that's she's losing.
That's what I meant.

16:21.224 --> 16:23.532
All right, what are we
waiting on? Let's get dressed.

16:30.268 --> 16:33.165
Martini. Shaken, not stirred.

16:33.168 --> 16:34.743
Married people are smug and annoying,

16:34.746 --> 16:36.728
but it's kind of fun playing a newlywed.

16:37.786 --> 16:40.009
You know, we never talked
about our honeymoon.

16:40.012 --> 16:42.572
I got it. Yellowknife, Canada.

16:42.575 --> 16:44.952
Yeah. Who needs Paris?

16:44.955 --> 16:47.829
They have these amazing
cabins where you can sit,

16:47.832 --> 16:51.084
roast marshmallows, and
watch the aurora borealis.

16:51.087 --> 16:53.464
- That sounds amazing.
- It is.

16:53.467 --> 16:54.926
It's a disturbance in the magnetosphere

16:54.928 --> 16:56.888
caused by solar wind.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.600
You were talking about the marshmallows.

16:58.603 --> 16:59.893
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sorry.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.326
Solar wind gets me really excited.

17:01.329 --> 17:03.650
And that's why I married you.

17:03.653 --> 17:06.112
Funny thing is, I don't really gamble.

17:06.115 --> 17:09.117
- I hate losing money.
- Well, it is my money.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.696
Let's blow some cash.

17:13.539 --> 17:15.923
Bust. I'm sorry, ma'am.

17:15.925 --> 17:17.887
You lose.

17:23.021 --> 17:24.762
Manager's not biting.

17:24.765 --> 17:27.540
Perhaps because Desi
hasn't hit bottom yet.

17:27.542 --> 17:30.814
Mac, I'm sure you can fix that.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.200
$5,000?

17:47.203 --> 17:48.913
That should get his attention.

17:53.820 --> 17:55.759
Bust. Lady loses again.

17:58.934 --> 18:01.394
- He's not biting.
- We need to go bigger.

18:01.397 --> 18:02.564
Take out a marker...

18:02.567 --> 18:04.384
10,000 euros... lose it on roulette.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.763
That'll make you look reckless

18:05.766 --> 18:07.689
- and put you in their debt.
- It's your money.

18:07.692 --> 18:09.432
- You sure?
- If it brings down Codex,

18:09.435 --> 18:11.368
you can spend all of it.

18:11.371 --> 18:13.332
Marker up. 10,000.

18:14.565 --> 18:17.431
Place your bets, please.

18:17.434 --> 18:19.806
Now, we really didn't
skimp on this, did we?

18:26.628 --> 18:28.664
- Betting is closed.
- What's wrong?

18:28.667 --> 18:30.459
21 was our lucky number.

18:30.462 --> 18:32.376
Thought you told me it was 42,

18:32.379 --> 18:34.329
from The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy.

18:34.332 --> 18:35.374
It is,

18:35.377 --> 18:38.017
but she always said that
she had no luck, so I said

18:38.020 --> 18:40.056
I'd give her half of mine. Half of 42,

18:40.059 --> 18:41.893
21. Our lucky number.

18:41.896 --> 18:43.853
My God, that is nauseating.

18:47.473 --> 18:50.368
21 red wins 350,000.

18:50.371 --> 18:51.603
This is not good.

18:51.606 --> 18:53.482
You're meant to be
wallowing in debt by now.

18:53.485 --> 18:56.470
This is the weirdest
problem I've ever had.

18:56.473 --> 18:58.243
Riley, I need your purse.

18:58.246 --> 19:00.173
Doesn't match your outfit, but okay.

19:00.176 --> 19:04.487
Ma'am? Lady lets it ride. 360,000.

19:04.490 --> 19:06.509
Taylor, I'm gonna need
one of your epic sneezes

19:06.512 --> 19:08.263
in about ten seconds.

19:08.266 --> 19:12.118
These days the security
cameras in casinos

19:12.121 --> 19:13.837
- are pretty advanced.
- Taylor.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.150
But some things they
can't see? Magnetic fields

19:16.153 --> 19:18.251
and eddy currents whirling
out of roulette wheels,

19:18.254 --> 19:19.884
which can be affected by strong,

19:19.887 --> 19:22.423
rare Earth magnets used in purse clasps.

19:26.993 --> 19:29.228
33 black is the winner.

19:29.231 --> 19:30.898
I'm sorry, ma'am.

19:30.901 --> 19:33.529
10,000 marker call.

19:39.890 --> 19:42.183
Desi, you've got incoming.

19:42.186 --> 19:43.604
Prego.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.141
- Oh.
- Pardon me.

19:53.144 --> 19:54.812
Terribly sorry.

19:54.815 --> 19:57.984
Well, The Merchant
didn't waste any time.

19:57.987 --> 20:01.657
He's in the building. He
wants to meet with Desi now.

20:07.052 --> 20:09.762
We need to find another way up there.

20:09.763 --> 20:12.634
Desi, we're losing visual.
You need to radio us your 20.

20:12.637 --> 20:13.846
Stand by.

20:16.019 --> 20:19.290
How is it you always seem to
manage to find a coil of rope?

20:19.293 --> 20:21.681
Same reason that I look
better in a tux than you do.

20:21.684 --> 20:24.144
The universe wants it that way.

20:24.147 --> 20:26.149
Please wait here, ma'am.

20:28.990 --> 20:30.991
Taylor, that pergola's the best way up.

20:30.994 --> 20:32.829
The interior stairs are heavily guarded.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.181
Guys, I'm in the library.

20:34.184 --> 20:35.322
Flanked by two rooms.

20:35.325 --> 20:38.212
Both have side doors.
Two guards in the hallway.

20:38.215 --> 20:41.220
Wait, two rooms? That means we
can trap him from both sides.

20:41.223 --> 20:44.361
But he needs to come out
the way he came in. Quietly.

20:46.352 --> 20:47.977
Time.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.517
Okay, once they hit the south gate,

20:49.520 --> 20:51.439
- we have a two-minute window.
- Right.

20:55.194 --> 20:56.861
Ah, Ms. Le.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.736
Thank you so very much

20:58.739 --> 21:00.323
for agreeing to meet me last minute.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.165
I do hope it wasn't an imposition.

21:02.168 --> 21:04.384
Actually, what I did
was, I got them to get

21:04.387 --> 21:05.720
the best bottle of grappa.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.807
Just-just to make up for it, really.

21:07.810 --> 21:10.212
Oi. Oi, Kristina.

21:10.215 --> 21:11.907
That's actually a bit aggressive.

21:11.910 --> 21:13.993
What you do is you offer

21:13.996 --> 21:16.372
somebody a drink, you
don't just plunk it on them.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.621
Anyway, we'll know for
next time. Won't we?

21:18.624 --> 21:20.454
Okay. Uh, sorry about that.

21:20.457 --> 21:22.165
Sorry.

21:22.168 --> 21:25.964
Some people say that I've
got control issues. Um...

21:27.701 --> 21:29.327
Anyway, cheers.

21:33.127 --> 21:35.128
My commiserations.

21:35.131 --> 21:37.767
I hear that you had a lousy night.

21:39.037 --> 21:41.457
Luckily, I'm here to help.

21:48.018 --> 21:50.520
Please. Please take a seat.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.845
Yes, I did my research

21:52.848 --> 21:54.236
on you, and, um,

21:54.239 --> 21:57.306
I read actually a really
heartwarming story,

21:57.309 --> 21:58.814
how you were playing

21:58.817 --> 22:01.079
soccer in the park in
your, in your hometown

22:01.082 --> 22:02.197
when you were scouted

22:02.200 --> 22:03.955
for a university scholarship.

22:03.957 --> 22:06.669
- Is that true? Is it, really?
- Yeah.

22:06.672 --> 22:09.236
That's amazing. That
is... that's talent.

22:09.239 --> 22:10.782
Doesn't happen every day.

22:10.785 --> 22:12.745
Oh.

22:19.369 --> 22:21.246
Where-where was that, again?

22:22.672 --> 22:24.812
The park where I was scouted?

22:24.815 --> 22:26.509
Little busy right now, Des.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.900
Yeah.

22:27.903 --> 22:30.049
- You want to know the name?
- Well, you know the name.

22:30.051 --> 22:31.517
I do.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.345
Uh, it-it's a funny thing.

22:33.348 --> 22:34.474
I'm just kind of having

22:34.477 --> 22:37.689
a-a difficult time remembering
the name of the park.

22:37.692 --> 22:41.403
Is it... can I ask...
that you don't remember,

22:41.406 --> 22:43.407
or you don't know?

22:48.839 --> 22:50.506
Ellis Park, Santa Rosa.

22:50.634 --> 22:53.150
Ellis Park. Santa Rosa.

22:54.267 --> 22:56.462
Ellis Park.

22:56.465 --> 22:58.299
It was on the tip of my tongue, too.

22:58.302 --> 23:00.679
Hmm.

23:00.682 --> 23:03.001
- Hmm.
- So...

23:03.004 --> 23:05.674
why am I here?

23:10.843 --> 23:13.079
I have a proposition for you.

23:18.220 --> 23:19.744
Tell me.

23:19.745 --> 23:23.564
Would that help your situation?

23:25.843 --> 23:27.665
What do I have to do?

23:27.668 --> 23:30.003
A small favor.

23:30.006 --> 23:32.314
Botch a penalty kick in the first half.

23:33.782 --> 23:36.285
You want me to throw the match?

23:37.059 --> 23:38.726
Yeah.

23:38.729 --> 23:40.646
Oh, uh...

23:40.649 --> 23:42.743
I don't know if I could do that.

23:47.366 --> 23:50.534
Well, that's very disappointing to hear.

23:50.537 --> 23:53.329
Always the same.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.704
I have players, they're in trouble,

23:55.707 --> 23:57.962
I suggest something, and as
soon as I do, "Oh, my God.

23:57.965 --> 24:00.092
"No, no, I couldn't possibly
do that. No. My principles.

24:00.094 --> 24:01.634
"I couldn't look myself in the eye.

24:01.637 --> 24:03.596
And my loyalty to the team."

24:03.599 --> 24:06.019
I don't know if you're telling
the truth or if you're feigning.

24:06.021 --> 24:08.173
But surprise, surprise...
let me tell you something...

24:08.176 --> 24:09.759
everybody does it.

24:09.762 --> 24:11.025
And you know why?

24:13.530 --> 24:15.595
Because it's easy money.

24:18.144 --> 24:21.072
Just a, just a penalty kick?

24:21.075 --> 24:24.243
Well, missing the penalty, yeah.

24:24.246 --> 24:26.243
- Missing's the important part.
- Of course.

24:26.246 --> 24:27.496
It's called spot-fixing.

24:27.499 --> 24:28.806
Yeah, I mean, you can bet

24:28.809 --> 24:30.938
on almost anything today.
Injuries, throw-ins,

24:30.941 --> 24:32.954
or-or a penalty kick, like I say.

24:32.957 --> 24:34.958
Sports betting's got very sophisticated.

24:34.961 --> 24:36.485
But I'm just a benchwarmer. I don't...

24:36.488 --> 24:38.197
know how I can get in the game.

24:39.789 --> 24:41.623
You got a point there. Thank you

24:41.626 --> 24:44.556
for bringing that to my attention, yes.

24:44.559 --> 24:47.548
Well, what I'll have to do
is have a word with the coach.

24:47.551 --> 24:50.079
She and I are on friendly terms.

24:50.082 --> 24:53.168
And we'll see if we can't
get you on the pitch, Ms. Le.

24:53.171 --> 24:55.400
Right. On my command.

24:55.403 --> 24:56.987
Okay. Ready.

24:58.243 --> 24:59.827
Hold that thought.

24:59.830 --> 25:01.990
I'll just tell this person
to go away and we can, um...

25:03.454 --> 25:06.540
Actually, I need to... Um, I do
actually have to take this call.

25:06.543 --> 25:08.001
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- If you...

25:08.011 --> 25:09.487
- You want me to wait in the other room.
- Yeah. If you wouldn't mind.

25:09.489 --> 25:11.095
W-With Kristina. She'll see you out.

25:11.098 --> 25:12.650
Nicely. Thank-thank you.

25:12.653 --> 25:15.239
Lovely. Lovely.

25:23.545 --> 25:25.923
This is good. He's distracted.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.913
I'll take care of the bodyguard
and you grab The Merchant.

25:27.915 --> 25:30.131
- Wait a minute.
- ...sarÃ  al partita di calcio domani?

25:30.135 --> 25:31.594
- Did you hear that?
- Ho bisogno

25:31.597 --> 25:34.687
di conferma che sia Titan.

25:34.690 --> 25:36.149
Everybody, hold your positions.

25:36.152 --> 25:38.030
Just stand down. Repeat, stand down.

25:38.033 --> 25:39.450
Do not approach The Merchant.

25:39.453 --> 25:40.787
Taylor, what's going on?

25:40.790 --> 25:42.166
I'm gonna have to go back in there.

25:42.168 --> 25:43.877
Are we gonna take this
sleazeball or what?

25:43.880 --> 25:45.590
Just go back in and you
wrap up your meeting.

25:45.592 --> 25:46.616
You act naturally.

25:46.619 --> 25:48.991
We all rendezvous at
the safe house later on.

25:48.994 --> 25:50.912
We can't abort. We have him.

25:50.915 --> 25:52.166
Trust me.

25:54.735 --> 25:57.362
I heard something on The
Merchant's phone call.

25:57.365 --> 25:59.324
At tomorrow's game,
there will be a meeting

25:59.327 --> 26:02.529
between The Merchant and
the head of Codex. The boss.

26:02.532 --> 26:04.124
Code Name: Titan.

26:04.127 --> 26:07.022
That's why I called off the
mission. We can get them both.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.905
Are you sure you heard it correctly?

26:08.908 --> 26:10.913
What are you insinuating?

26:10.916 --> 26:12.757
That you've been out of your mind.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.137
You're sleep-deprived and
it's affecting your judgment.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.452
I can assure you that I'm wide awake.

26:18.455 --> 26:20.272
And this is the closest I've ever been.

26:20.275 --> 26:23.110
I think you mean,
"we've ever been." Right?

26:23.113 --> 26:26.155
Because we're in this together?
We depend on each other?

26:26.158 --> 26:28.897
And right now, we need to
know that we can depend on you.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.034
- They'll be there.
- Did The Merchant

26:37.037 --> 26:38.297
happen to say where in the stadium

26:38.299 --> 26:39.775
this meeting will take place?

26:39.778 --> 26:41.779
Unfortunately, no.

26:41.780 --> 26:43.737
Actually, I think

26:43.740 --> 26:45.397
I know how to locate them,

26:45.400 --> 26:48.610
but since Finals games
are pretty well-attended,

26:48.613 --> 26:50.739
it's gonna be a challenge.

26:53.254 --> 26:55.030
You said challenge, not impossible.

26:55.033 --> 26:56.075
No, we can do this.

26:56.078 --> 26:57.929
Riley's gonna be our
eyes in the control room.

26:57.932 --> 26:59.474
Big Brother, coming up.

26:59.477 --> 27:00.936
Des, you hanging in there?

27:00.939 --> 27:02.210
So far so good.

27:02.213 --> 27:03.578
The Merchant thinks I'm about to botch

27:03.580 --> 27:04.913
a penalty kick in the first half,

27:04.916 --> 27:06.927
but there's no way I'm
making Codex any richer.

27:06.930 --> 27:07.888
Not unless you want to fund

27:07.889 --> 27:09.937
another terrorist attack
on innocent civilians.

27:09.940 --> 27:11.774
Oh, my God. Do any of you actually know

27:11.777 --> 27:13.203
what a pep talk is?

27:13.205 --> 27:14.562
Riley?

27:14.565 --> 27:15.858
Riley, my comms are on the fritz.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.312
I'll just stand by...

27:19.291 --> 27:21.249
What is this? We had a plan.

27:21.252 --> 27:22.962
Well, this is part of
the plan, only we didn't

27:22.964 --> 27:24.765
tell you about it beforehand.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.062
See, Kristina and I had
a long chat last night,

27:27.065 --> 27:29.992
and as much as we'd like to
avoid another Gabriella fiasco,

27:29.995 --> 27:32.499
I felt we needed a
little bit more insurance.

27:33.534 --> 27:34.702
Now, hold still.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.811
If I press this button...

27:44.947 --> 27:47.157
...my garage door at home opens.

27:47.937 --> 27:49.051
Just kidding.

27:49.054 --> 27:50.596
The minuscule chip we've just injected

27:50.599 --> 27:53.069
into your neck will
deliver a high-voltage shock

27:53.072 --> 27:55.865
that will stop your heart
and kill you instantly.

27:55.868 --> 27:59.210
Just in case you had any second
thoughts about our arrangement.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.488
Uh, uh, uh.

28:06.923 --> 28:08.383
Right.

28:10.541 --> 28:12.679
Mac?

28:12.689 --> 28:15.037
- Do you copy? Mac?
- Yeah, go ahead. I'm here.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.944
I know how The Merchant
killed Gabriella.

28:16.947 --> 28:18.866
If I don't throw the game,
he's gonna kill me, too.

28:18.868 --> 28:19.868
If I do throw the game,

28:19.871 --> 28:21.430
Codex will have money
for another attack.

28:21.432 --> 28:23.057
Wait. D-Desi, slow down.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.812
Mac, he injected something into me

28:24.815 --> 28:26.163
that can stop my heart.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.588
_

28:34.595 --> 28:39.970
_

28:40.344 --> 28:44.799
_

28:46.256 --> 28:47.998
Grazie.

28:57.662 --> 28:58.886
We should just focus

28:58.889 --> 29:00.453
on finding The Merchant.
Get the drop on him

29:00.455 --> 29:01.414
before he hits that button.

29:01.415 --> 29:02.790
He's a needle in a haystack.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.292
Desi doesn't have that kind of time.

29:04.293 --> 29:05.566
We had a plan. If we find the boss,

29:05.568 --> 29:07.336
we get the boss, we get The Merchant.

29:07.337 --> 29:09.922
That's still Desi's best chance.

29:09.923 --> 29:12.466
Mac.

29:12.469 --> 29:14.901
Mac. Care to weigh in on this?

29:14.904 --> 29:16.347
I need to get to Desi to find out

29:16.350 --> 29:17.305
what's going on with that chip.

29:17.306 --> 29:18.472
Just stick to the plan.

29:22.811 --> 29:25.271
Mac to Desi. It's time
to use one of those

29:25.272 --> 29:26.480
acting tips from Bozer.

29:26.481 --> 29:27.682
I'm at your three.

29:27.685 --> 29:29.145
Copy that.

29:32.499 --> 29:34.914
You okay?

29:41.518 --> 29:43.921
If you need to see
through a person's skin,

29:43.924 --> 29:45.625
and you don't have an X-ray machine,

29:45.626 --> 29:47.293
infrared light can help.

29:47.294 --> 29:48.929
All right, now tell her you're okay.

29:48.932 --> 29:50.851
I need you to sit up,
so I can scan your neck.

29:50.854 --> 29:52.846
I'm fine... just give me some space.

29:52.849 --> 29:54.967
By removing the infrared
filter from your camera,

29:54.968 --> 29:56.991
and exposing the skin
to infrared light...

29:56.994 --> 29:59.291
for example, from this
remote control unit...

29:59.294 --> 30:01.462
you'll be able to see
beneath the top layer

30:01.465 --> 30:03.466
of a person's skin.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.144
The chip in your neck is

30:05.145 --> 30:07.133
powered by a remote
microwave transmitter.

30:07.136 --> 30:08.303
As soon as he presses

30:08.306 --> 30:09.968
the button, the signal is instant.

30:09.971 --> 30:12.110
Up we go.

30:14.196 --> 30:16.197
Well, can we get this thing out of me?

30:16.198 --> 30:19.659
Well, yeah, but that
would just tip him off,

30:19.660 --> 30:21.369
and he'd trigger it anyways.

30:21.372 --> 30:22.662
Desi...?

30:22.663 --> 30:24.538
You'll figure it out.

30:24.539 --> 30:26.415
I know you will.

30:28.418 --> 30:30.619
Heads up... you guys see the chopper?

30:34.216 --> 30:35.925
That helicopter has to be Titan.

30:35.926 --> 30:37.176
That's his transport of choice.

30:37.177 --> 30:38.666
All right, Riley, you're up.

30:40.597 --> 30:42.827
Checking the restricted access corridor.

30:42.830 --> 30:44.558
I have eyes on Titan.

30:44.559 --> 30:46.060
Russ, Boze, you're up.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.804
He's heading towards the VIP skybox

30:47.807 --> 30:49.815
in the southeast concourse.

30:58.071 --> 30:59.947
Four bodyguards.

30:59.950 --> 31:01.742
Kind of had my heart set on two.

31:01.743 --> 31:04.870
If we're gonna go down,
we're gonna go down fighting.

31:04.871 --> 31:07.572
Hey, take it easy, Leroy Jenkins.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.917
Let's be strategic about this.

31:09.918 --> 31:12.628
Right, let's burn it down, shall we?

31:12.629 --> 31:15.798
Is that a British way
to say "strategic"?

31:18.885 --> 31:20.511
The game's about to start.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.471
- Do they have him?
- Not yet.

31:22.472 --> 31:24.098
What are they doing?

31:24.099 --> 31:26.309
Incendio!

31:31.696 --> 31:33.939
_

31:33.942 --> 31:36.068
That fear is real.

31:36.069 --> 31:37.657
This can't be right.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.202
Not for the head of Codex.

31:40.993 --> 31:42.496
Read this.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.377
_

31:44.643 --> 31:45.468
_

31:45.479 --> 31:46.604
_

31:46.696 --> 31:47.738
_

31:47.739 --> 31:50.366
_

31:50.367 --> 31:52.875
_

31:52.878 --> 31:54.628
Bugger!

31:54.629 --> 31:56.130
Bugger!

31:56.131 --> 31:58.841
- They sent a decoy.
- Does that mean they're on to us?

31:58.842 --> 32:00.820
Could be standing operating
procedure, but who knows?

32:00.822 --> 32:01.843
But we've lost him.

32:01.846 --> 32:03.616
There's no Titan, no Merchant.

32:03.619 --> 32:05.114
No way to save Desi.

32:20.531 --> 32:24.075
So, this is nice, isn't it?

32:24.078 --> 32:26.715
Look, I know you're feeling

32:26.718 --> 32:28.464
critical about the whole operation,

32:28.467 --> 32:30.468
and-and I hear you loud and clear.

32:30.471 --> 32:33.460
I just wanted to assure you
everything is back on track.

32:33.463 --> 32:36.042
I've got a new player. She's great.

32:36.045 --> 32:38.004
And in a couple of moments,

32:38.007 --> 32:41.385
I'll be able to deliver the
funds to you that I promised.

32:57.565 --> 32:59.408
_

33:01.588 --> 33:04.122
Le, you're up.

33:07.661 --> 33:10.204
Mac... I'm going in.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.331
If I don't throw the
match by the first half,

33:12.332 --> 33:13.875
The Merchant's gonna trigger this chip.

33:13.877 --> 33:15.376
Still working on a plan.

33:15.379 --> 33:16.796
Well, you got nine minutes.

33:16.799 --> 33:18.050
Otherwise, this crowd's gonna get

33:18.052 --> 33:20.137
a show they didn't bargain for.

33:20.140 --> 33:22.307
I think I have a plan on how

33:22.310 --> 33:24.729
to save you from The Merchant,
but you're not gonna like this.

33:24.731 --> 33:26.058
We're gonna let him trigger the chip.

33:26.060 --> 33:27.102
I'm sorry, what now?

33:27.105 --> 33:28.147
This is your only shot.

33:28.150 --> 33:29.650
Do you trust me?

33:33.153 --> 33:34.653
Desi, do you copy?

33:34.656 --> 33:35.706
Of course I trust you.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.378
I never stopped.

33:47.245 --> 33:49.413
We can use the crowd.

33:49.414 --> 33:51.414
If The Merchant hits the button
on the device, we can trace

33:51.416 --> 33:53.258
that signal back to him...
he's probably boosting it

33:53.260 --> 33:54.961
- with an antenna.
- What's the point of that?

33:54.962 --> 33:57.213
If he pushes the button, it's
too late... Desi gets shocked.

33:57.214 --> 33:58.589
No, not if we intercept
it before it reaches her.

33:58.590 --> 33:59.924
Riley, what would it take to triangulate

33:59.925 --> 34:02.230
that signal using a cell phone GPS?

34:02.233 --> 34:04.095
Software for the phones to communicate.

34:04.098 --> 34:06.367
- I could push it through the stadium app.
- That's genius.

34:06.369 --> 34:08.620
Use the cell phones in the
crowd... they won't even know.

34:08.623 --> 34:10.761
Guess I'm hacking the
phone company again.

34:10.764 --> 34:12.710
Once The Merchant presses that button,

34:12.712 --> 34:14.867
- we'll be able to track his location.
- And Russ and I will grab him.

34:14.869 --> 34:16.062
Right, let's just take this back.

34:16.063 --> 34:17.940
How exactly are you gonna stop Desi

34:17.943 --> 34:19.610
from being electrocuted?

34:22.085 --> 34:23.469
I'm gonna build a jammer.

34:23.473 --> 34:24.991
"A jammer"?

34:29.114 --> 34:31.699
Walkie-talkies are
essentially radio transmitters.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.855
In order to drown out The
Merchant's trigger signal,

34:33.858 --> 34:35.859
I need to create a
broad spectrum, multiple

34:35.860 --> 34:37.485
frequency radio broadcast.

34:37.487 --> 34:39.696
Also known as a jammer.

34:44.703 --> 34:46.246
There's two minutes to go.

34:46.897 --> 34:48.340
According to her instructions,

34:48.342 --> 34:50.094
she's meant to botch a penalty kick,

34:50.097 --> 34:51.581
but how can she when there's no...?

34:53.753 --> 34:54.795
Penalty.

34:54.799 --> 34:56.051
There it is.

35:00.677 --> 35:02.142
Please tell me

35:02.145 --> 35:03.296
that jammer's ready.

35:03.299 --> 35:04.796
Almost. I'm gonna have to

35:04.799 --> 35:07.097
get closer, though...
the range is too limited.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.601
I need you to buy some time.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.608
Guys, I can't stall any longer.

35:26.611 --> 35:27.654
I'm locked out of the field.

35:27.656 --> 35:28.782
Give me one more minute.

35:29.539 --> 35:31.124
Whoa.

35:37.044 --> 35:38.211
That's my girl.

35:38.214 --> 35:39.569
Here we go.

35:50.531 --> 35:51.757
What?!

36:15.208 --> 36:17.043
Guys, what's going on?

36:17.046 --> 36:18.462
We're tracking him now.

36:18.463 --> 36:19.630
Section 327.

36:19.631 --> 36:21.507
Let's go.

36:31.943 --> 36:33.936
You cut it close there.

36:33.939 --> 36:35.764
Really thought I was a goner.

36:49.079 --> 36:51.247
I can sense your disappointment.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.876
I'm a bit upset right now myself.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.131
Just please accept my apology.

36:56.134 --> 36:58.636
I'll find a way to recover
the funds, I promise.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.697
Right.

37:19.672 --> 37:22.358
There's no sign of
Titan or The Merchant.

37:25.435 --> 37:27.019
We found his remote.

37:27.022 --> 37:28.482
Means we can't track him.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.558
Well, maybe there
will be less bickering.

37:34.561 --> 37:35.914
Are you kidding?

37:35.915 --> 37:37.664
Buckle up, buddy.

37:44.486 --> 37:45.679
Taylor!

37:45.682 --> 37:47.141
- Hmm?
- Wake up.

37:47.144 --> 37:49.132
Ooh, are we celebrating?

37:49.135 --> 37:51.303
Although The Merchant
may be in the wind,

37:51.306 --> 37:52.608
we spooked Codex enough

37:52.611 --> 37:54.811
to shut down the entire
match-fixing operation.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.231
It is now defunct.

37:56.234 --> 37:58.382
Russ, even though I'd
still call it a win,

37:58.385 --> 38:00.386
I'm sorry we didn't get Titan.

38:00.389 --> 38:02.808
Actually, I should be the
one that's apologizing.

38:02.811 --> 38:04.616
Codex has become

38:04.619 --> 38:06.829
somewhat of an obsession for me,

38:06.832 --> 38:08.792
and I may have gone a little bit...

38:09.326 --> 38:11.452
...bonkers, so...

38:11.455 --> 38:13.471
cheers.

38:13.474 --> 38:14.726
Cheers.

38:17.892 --> 38:19.601
Excuse me.

38:22.568 --> 38:24.444
Taylor, you all right?

38:26.033 --> 38:27.866
No.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.176
All right, guys, this better be good.

38:36.179 --> 38:38.223
What's going on?

38:41.578 --> 38:43.621
Mac?

38:47.361 --> 38:49.460
We've been going through
some security footage

38:49.463 --> 38:53.007
from the stadium of every
person who sat near The Merchant.

38:53.010 --> 38:55.202
Hoping for some leads.

38:57.977 --> 39:01.585
You brought me in here at
2:00 a.m. for a blurry photo?

39:01.588 --> 39:04.630
I had a friend at DARPA run it
through some facial analytics

39:04.633 --> 39:06.749
software to see if we could get

39:06.752 --> 39:09.130
a clue on Titan's identity.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.606
It's you.
