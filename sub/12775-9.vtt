10:40.279 --> 10:42.486
Yep... that's me.

10:42.491 --> 10:45.818
Sweet, protective, bordering
on broke, older brother.

10:46.355 --> 10:49.681
Oh my God, now I see
the family resemblance.

10:55.101 --> 10:56.420
You're kidding.

10:57.994 --> 11:00.567
Listen, Matt, you've
already met my family,

11:00.573 --> 11:03.098
and we haven't even had a second
date yet, we should have one of those.

11:03.103 --> 11:05.348
Yeah, we should have one of
those first, what do you think?

11:05.353 --> 11:08.488
Uh... well, uh, who's to
say the first date's over?

11:08.494 --> 11:09.694
Yeah, good point.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.984
Perhaps we should continue
this at your place?

11:12.350 --> 11:16.673
My place? Um, I'm not
sure if that's allowed?

11:17.657 --> 11:21.606
No, it-it-it's not, because it's
not your place, it's our place.

11:21.612 --> 11:24.406
Uh, yeah, ah, it's our little
one-bedroom apartment in the Mission,

11:24.412 --> 11:26.836
where we both live, and can
continue to watch each other.

11:29.300 --> 11:32.371
Yeah, we share an apartment.
Like we shared a womb.

11:33.448 --> 11:34.988
Yes, we're womb-mates.

11:39.635 --> 11:42.414
So... which one of you
sleeps in the bedroom?

11:42.420 --> 11:43.620
(Both) Oh, I do.

11:45.445 --> 11:47.938
- Not at the same time.
- 'Cause we're brother and sister.

11:50.488 --> 11:52.521
- Hi.
- Who's this?

11:52.527 --> 11:56.758
Oh, uh... this is our... third roommate.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.949
Yeah, it's... been a slow
year for tow truckin'.

12:02.348 --> 12:03.548
Tow trucking?

12:03.554 --> 12:06.966
Okay, Matt, Monica, why don't you
guys, uh, check out the fire escape,

12:06.972 --> 12:08.961
see if the... pizza
delivery guy's out there.

12:08.966 --> 12:11.170
- When did we order pizza?
- Oh, you know, Matt, that is a great

12:11.175 --> 12:13.581
idea, why don't you order some
pizza while you're out there?

12:14.865 --> 12:17.071
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
- Okay,

12:17.077 --> 12:19.788
Josh and I are brother and sister, and
this is my natural hair. Go with it.

12:19.793 --> 12:21.025
What?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.086
We made a bet, he wanted to
prove he could still get dates

12:23.091 --> 12:24.547
if he didn't tell them he was rich.

12:24.553 --> 12:25.938
And she wanted to prove
she can still get dates

12:25.943 --> 12:27.671
without letting guys
know she had big boobs.

12:29.872 --> 12:34.164
Okay, so you two are using these
two innocent people to win a bet?

12:34.170 --> 12:35.434
- Kinda.
- Yes!

12:35.943 --> 12:37.378
Who are you?

12:37.562 --> 12:39.196
Sofia, it's me, it's Gabi.

12:40.779 --> 12:42.640
Yeah, I know who you are! Okay,

12:42.646 --> 12:45.138
I-I just think you're... you're
acting horribly, and trust me,

12:45.144 --> 12:48.447
if anyone knows about people treating
other people horribly, it's me!

12:48.698 --> 12:49.898
[gasp]

12:53.862 --> 12:56.768
Now, I'm going to go to Martina's
salon, and when I get back,

12:56.774 --> 12:58.206
these two better be gone.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.822
Okay, maybe she's right, we
shouldn't be toying with these people.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.002
Yeah, they seem nice. We're
playing with their heads.

13:09.008 --> 13:10.454
- Let's tell them the truth.
- Okay.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.583
Hey! Monica. Matt.

13:13.765 --> 13:16.138
- We did half cheese, half pepperoni.
- Okay.

13:16.144 --> 13:17.713
Don't worry, my treat.

13:19.724 --> 13:24.447
Um, so guys, we actually, uh, we have
something that we need to tell you.

13:24.798 --> 13:26.260
Josh, you first.

13:26.266 --> 13:27.558
Me?

13:27.564 --> 13:28.962
Fine!

13:30.251 --> 13:34.315
Um, but before I do, um, there's
something I'd like to know.

13:34.321 --> 13:37.327
Um... if I asked you on a
second date, would you say yes?

13:37.333 --> 13:40.172
- Totally.
- What if you found out I was rich?

13:41.293 --> 13:43.475
- What?
- I'm sorry. Um...

13:43.753 --> 13:45.481
I have a hundred million dollars.

13:46.082 --> 13:47.583
From tow trucking?

13:48.082 --> 13:50.569
No... more from being a tech mogul.

13:51.221 --> 13:54.472
Oh my God... you know,
for the last five years,

13:54.478 --> 13:58.136
I have been in therapy working
through my trust issues with men.

13:58.142 --> 14:01.231
And now I finally meet someone
who seems honest and sweet

14:01.237 --> 14:04.158
and kind, and he turns
out to be another liar!

14:04.164 --> 14:06.296
[crying]

14:06.302 --> 14:08.137
Okay, so no second date, then?

14:09.417 --> 14:11.374
Oh my God, no!

14:15.331 --> 14:16.729
Your turn, sis.

14:18.289 --> 14:20.691
Matt, I have uh...
something I gotta tell you,

14:20.697 --> 14:24.234
but before I do, were you,
uh... gonna ask me out again?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.824
- Definitely.
- Oh.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.744
Well, what if I told
you I look like this?

14:31.389 --> 14:33.900
Wow. Uh, I can't believe it.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.383
Are you mad?

14:35.389 --> 14:37.618
Are you kidding, can the
second date start now?

14:40.773 --> 14:42.846
Ooh! It sure can.

14:42.852 --> 14:44.766
In your face, Josh. I win! I win!

14:45.133 --> 14:47.360
Oh, and can you pay the
rent on your way out,

14:47.366 --> 14:49.527
'cause it's already
late, thanks, buh-bye!

14:52.746 --> 14:54.567
So, date's over already?

14:54.823 --> 14:56.414
Did ya hit it and quit it?

14:58.216 --> 15:01.158
No... she walked out on me.

15:01.509 --> 15:04.035
Look on the bright side, at least
you weren't dating a criminal,

15:04.041 --> 15:06.307
like that dumpy chick in the tracksuit.

15:06.492 --> 15:09.687
What? What are you talking about?
How do you know he's a criminal?

15:09.781 --> 15:13.195
He filled out a job application
earlier, and he checked "felon."

15:13.976 --> 15:16.713
Next to it he put, "not a murderer."

15:18.267 --> 15:20.126
Oh my God, Gabi's with him right now.

15:20.132 --> 15:21.999
That ugmo was Gabi?

15:23.593 --> 15:25.527
Boy, she's let herself go.

15:29.119 --> 15:31.832
Gabi? Gabi!

15:31.838 --> 15:33.291
[Gabi's muffled voice]

15:39.961 --> 15:41.348
I didn't win.

15:45.129 --> 15:47.051
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

15:47.372 --> 15:48.993
I can't believe it.

15:49.184 --> 15:51.808
Matt didn't wanna date
me, he wanted to rob me!

15:53.168 --> 15:55.395
Hey, I mean... he didn't take anything.

15:56.897 --> 15:58.530
Well, nothing of mine.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.593
What do you mean?

16:01.157 --> 16:03.771
Do you remember how you...
put your wallet in my purse?

16:03.777 --> 16:05.002
Yeah?

16:06.649 --> 16:07.981
[whispered] He found it.

16:09.207 --> 16:11.091
Ahh!

16:12.271 --> 16:15.320
It's okay. You know what,
everything in there can be replaced.

16:15.326 --> 16:16.810
What's important is that you're safe.

16:16.816 --> 16:19.659
Uh-huh, do you remember how you put
your really fancy watch in my purse?

16:21.810 --> 16:24.878
You mean my... grandfather's
irreplaceable Rolex?

16:24.991 --> 16:26.559
Unless you have two!

16:27.165 --> 16:29.784
Nope, just the one, just
the irreplaceable one.

16:30.674 --> 16:32.388
- Are you mad?
- No.

16:32.394 --> 16:35.086
Are you just saying that because I'm
really vulnerable right now because

16:35.091 --> 16:36.552
I was tied up by a criminal?

16:36.923 --> 16:38.123
No.

16:38.129 --> 16:40.986
Josh, if you're mad, I can
take it, you can tell me.

16:40.992 --> 16:42.321
- I'm mad!
- [gasp]

16:42.327 --> 16:44.719
How dare you! I could've
been really hurt!

16:44.725 --> 16:47.303
That's... the point, Gabi,
you could've been really hurt.

16:47.309 --> 16:49.554
- Then why are you yelling at me?
- Because none of this would've happened

16:49.559 --> 16:51.194
if you didn't make me
make that stupid bet!

16:51.199 --> 16:54.492
Oh, please, you couldn't wait to
prove that I have no personality!

16:55.557 --> 16:56.894
You started this whole thing

16:56.900 --> 16:58.786
when you said I only get
girls because of my money.

16:58.791 --> 17:01.183
Yeah, well, that's because you
were being so cocky and arrogant,

17:01.188 --> 17:03.954
I didn't really feel like
telling you how smart and sexy

17:03.960 --> 17:05.426
and incredible you are!

17:05.777 --> 17:08.905
Oh, yeah? Well, let
me tell you something.

17:09.406 --> 17:11.694
- You've got a great personality!
- [gasp]

17:11.907 --> 17:14.616
And you're sweet, and
funny, and charming...

17:14.622 --> 17:16.422
you're the whole damn package!

17:18.094 --> 17:20.996
Yeah, well... so are you, any
girl would kill to be with you!

17:21.002 --> 17:22.680
Any guy would kill to be with you!

17:31.409 --> 17:35.347
Oh, Elliot... Oh... I got your
9-1-1 text. What's the emergency?

17:35.353 --> 17:38.349
I... I was afraid... that
were stuck in somethin'...

17:38.355 --> 17:39.977
or somethin' was stuck in you.

17:41.549 --> 17:42.858
Not this time.

17:47.243 --> 17:48.861
This is all her fault.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.979
She tried to show me
how to do your hair...

17:50.985 --> 17:53.554
but obviously she's a terrible teacher!

17:53.801 --> 17:56.937
It's not my fault I got the one gay
guy who doesn't know how to do hair!

17:58.254 --> 18:00.952
Why would you wanna learn
how to do my [!] hair?

18:00.958 --> 18:02.956
You and Alan are getting so close,

18:02.962 --> 18:05.020
but you and I still
haven't found our thing.

18:05.026 --> 18:07.244
so I thought this could be our thing.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.953
But obviously I was wrong. Sorry.

18:10.142 --> 18:15.172
So, you did... this [!], 'cause you
wanted to spend more time together?

18:15.352 --> 18:16.821
Yeah, I guess.

18:17.871 --> 18:19.213
[sighs]

18:19.219 --> 18:22.682
You know... you're a weird
dude, but at the same time,

18:22.688 --> 18:24.424
I guess you're okay.

18:24.701 --> 18:25.920
Really?

18:26.113 --> 18:28.533
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

18:29.018 --> 18:31.956
Ohhh, it warms my heart.

18:32.635 --> 18:34.420
I know how to fix this!

18:34.426 --> 18:35.668
A makeover.

18:35.674 --> 18:39.658
I'll call a spa, get us a
hair appointment, manicures...

18:39.664 --> 18:40.864
Wait!

18:41.320 --> 18:45.358
You think you can throw around a
lot of money to buy my [!] love?

18:45.727 --> 18:47.014
I'm in!

18:56.336 --> 18:57.812
What was that?

18:58.586 --> 19:01.056
That... was sex.

19:01.429 --> 19:04.281
- Really good sex.
- Amazing sex.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.976
Oh my God, how many times did
we think this was gonna happen,

19:06.982 --> 19:10.205
and it didn't happen,
but now... it did happen.

19:10.872 --> 19:12.082
How did it happen?

19:14.165 --> 19:15.578
How did it happen?

19:15.584 --> 19:17.263
I have no idea.

19:17.510 --> 19:21.057
- But it can never happen again!
- Absolutely... never!

19:21.815 --> 19:23.275
Why?

19:23.917 --> 19:25.883
Because we're horrible together.

19:25.889 --> 19:27.763
- But I thought you just said that...
- No, no, no, no.

19:27.768 --> 19:29.834
Not the sex part...
the relationship part.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.918
- We suck at that part.
- This is true.

19:31.924 --> 19:33.696
So we have to forget
this ever happened, okay?

19:33.701 --> 19:36.086
And we can't tell anybody,
because if somebody else knows,

19:36.091 --> 19:37.511
it keeps it alive...

19:37.672 --> 19:40.381
- and we have to kill it! Now!
- Agreed.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.408
But it was really good sex.

19:43.691 --> 19:45.558
Amazing sex.

19:46.511 --> 19:49.340
Josh? I just wanted
to say I-I'm really...

19:50.081 --> 19:52.321
Oh, gross!

19:52.509 --> 19:54.675
You're having sex with your sister?

19:54.681 --> 19:56.692
Is that what they do in Omaha?

19:57.822 --> 20:01.112
I can't believe I came back
here to ask you out again.

20:03.545 --> 20:05.373
Oh, you're disgusting!

20:07.288 --> 20:08.488
[door slams]

20:09.267 --> 20:10.689
I can't believe this.

20:11.681 --> 20:13.085
I got a second date!

20:13.091 --> 20:15.699
Which means, I'll see you,
bright and early tomorrow.

20:15.705 --> 20:17.707
I win, I win, I win, I
win, I win, I win, I win!

20:17.713 --> 20:18.913
Dammit!

20:21.985 --> 20:24.611
I just have to say you're
glowing after that salt scrub.

20:24.617 --> 20:26.411
And you look like you lost five pounds

20:26.417 --> 20:28.372
- after that seaweed wrap.
- Oh.

20:28.766 --> 20:32.549
You know... today was more fun than
anything me and Alan have ever done.

20:32.555 --> 20:34.970
- Thank you.
- Aw, you're welcome.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.692
But it is not a contest.
Alan and I love you the same.

20:42.953 --> 20:44.687
Oh, thank God it was recording.

20:45.179 --> 20:47.797
Send to Alan. I win.
