WEBVTT

01:06.298 --> 01:08.501
This is not quite
the spiritual awakening

01:08.534 --> 01:09.836
I was searching for.

01:20.146 --> 01:24.150
Make it stop.

02:45.864 --> 02:48.266
Hey, wait up.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.502
Hey.

02:49.534 --> 02:50.745
I just wanted to say
thanks for that 20.

02:50.769 --> 02:52.538
Most people just
give me loose change.

02:52.570 --> 02:53.782
You got an album
out or something?

02:53.806 --> 02:55.575
Yeah, here, um, let
me give you a link.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.810
Oh, yeah, actually
used to play a little ah,

02:57.842 --> 02:59.744
French horn back in junior high.

02:59.777 --> 03:00.579
Oh.

03:00.612 --> 03:01.612
So.

03:02.981 --> 03:03.782
Hey!

03:03.816 --> 03:04.817
Hey!

03:04.849 --> 03:05.849
Hey!

03:07.385 --> 03:08.385
Hey!

03:47.992 --> 03:49.961
Welcome home.

03:49.995 --> 03:50.896
You got four egg rolls, right?

03:50.929 --> 03:52.265
Last time you only got two.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.770
Bam, Bell & Ross.

03:58.937 --> 04:00.039
It's fake.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.039
What?

04:01.073 --> 04:02.908
Yeah, ticking, see, not smooth.

04:02.941 --> 04:03.977
It's not real.

04:06.979 --> 04:09.415
You get any cash out of him?

04:09.448 --> 04:11.016
I actually cried this time.

04:11.717 --> 04:13.853
Oh, little Meryl Streep.

04:33.771 --> 04:34.771
Emily.

04:44.415 --> 04:45.483
How we lookin'?

04:45.516 --> 04:47.519
I'll give you 1,500.

04:47.552 --> 04:48.687
Deal.

04:48.721 --> 04:49.922
Let me get you some money.

04:51.589 --> 04:53.725
Babe, look who decided to
grace us with her presence.

04:53.759 --> 04:56.429
Oh, Emily, perfect.

04:56.461 --> 04:57.997
So I just whipped
up some jambalaya.

04:58.029 --> 04:59.331
Are you hungry?

04:59.365 --> 05:00.066
Ah, yeah.

05:00.098 --> 05:01.466
As if he just whipped it up.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.401
He's been in the
kitchen all morning.

05:02.434 --> 05:04.503
I'm a master at work here.

05:04.536 --> 05:07.072
Oh um, this came
and I brought it up.

05:07.105 --> 05:09.074
Awesome, I love when these come.

05:10.141 --> 05:13.945
Oh, these are my favorite, the
little pictures, the drawing.

05:13.978 --> 05:17.349
Oh my God, look how
big he is, babe.

05:18.817 --> 05:19.617
Ah, look at him.

05:19.651 --> 05:21.052
He was so little.

05:21.086 --> 05:21.920
That's our guy.

05:21.954 --> 05:22.954
So crazy.

05:23.922 --> 05:24.957
What about Camilla?

05:27.959 --> 05:31.596
Yeah, um, that's
partly why I'm here.

05:33.665 --> 05:34.665
What's going on?

05:35.701 --> 05:36.869
Well, she's sick.

05:43.141 --> 05:43.942
How'd you do?

05:43.975 --> 05:45.978
Got two grand.

05:46.011 --> 05:49.081
Whoa, that's fantastic.

05:49.113 --> 05:50.548
This better pay off.

05:50.581 --> 05:52.093
Listen, remember that
Redstone job last year?

05:52.117 --> 05:54.019
Mm, the one where everyone died?

05:54.052 --> 05:56.021
Real risk, means
real reward, right?

05:56.053 --> 05:58.089
Get to the point.

05:58.122 --> 06:00.658
Well, I found out who
set that whole thing up.

06:00.692 --> 06:02.061
The name's Lizzy.

06:02.093 --> 06:03.695
Lizzy?

06:20.012 --> 06:21.980
No, no, over there!

06:25.117 --> 06:27.586
Okay, five grand, gets
a look at the file,

06:27.619 --> 06:29.755
another five for exclusivity.

06:29.788 --> 06:30.923
10 grand?

06:30.956 --> 06:32.691
You gotta pay to play.

06:32.723 --> 06:33.725
We only have five.

06:36.060 --> 06:38.029
Fine, but you take
what I give you.

06:39.997 --> 06:41.199
The name is Benjamin Elwood,

06:41.233 --> 06:43.168
lives in an estate
outside of Houston.

06:45.036 --> 06:47.606
He's on some kind
of spiritual quest,

06:49.007 --> 06:51.177
traveling all over the
world looking for answers,

06:52.009 --> 06:53.111
trying to find God.

06:54.612 --> 06:57.483
Hello!

06:57.516 --> 06:59.919
God!

06:59.951 --> 07:03.689
This is, I could buy
and sell this place!

07:03.721 --> 07:04.889
I can buy and sell you!

07:04.923 --> 07:06.192
He's grieving, desperate.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.527
I mean crazy, obviously,

07:08.560 --> 07:10.495
but he also happens
to be very rich.

07:10.528 --> 07:11.497
How rich?

07:11.529 --> 07:12.697
Very.

07:12.730 --> 07:15.500
Hey, why don't you
talk to me, you coward!

07:16.201 --> 07:17.903
I don't get it.

07:17.935 --> 07:20.572
But I haven't even gotten to
the best part, he's unbanked.

07:20.605 --> 07:22.007
What's that?

07:22.040 --> 07:23.641
Unbanked.

07:23.675 --> 07:26.045
The word is he has
the whole of his fortune

07:26.077 --> 07:27.088
somewhere on his property.

07:27.112 --> 07:28.814
I'm not going anywhere!

07:28.846 --> 07:29.814
Sir, why don't you come with me?

07:29.848 --> 07:31.516
Get your hands off of me!

07:32.783 --> 07:34.719
It's all in the file.

07:37.154 --> 07:38.089
He's delusional.

07:38.122 --> 07:40.625
Come on, he lost his family.

07:40.658 --> 07:42.127
Yeah, so?

07:42.160 --> 07:43.637
So, you would think that
we know what that feels like.

07:43.661 --> 07:47.098
No, it will give us
insight on things to use.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.069
Need I remind you you collect
checks for fake orphans?

07:51.970 --> 07:53.205
We gotta use his grief,

07:53.237 --> 07:57.108
and tap into it and use
it to manipulate him.

07:57.141 --> 07:59.711
Like, okay, okay, okay,

07:59.745 --> 08:03.983
so we, we stage a
religious epiphany.

08:04.016 --> 08:07.220
What like put Jesus'
face on a piece of toast?

08:08.252 --> 08:09.654
You know the deal.

08:09.687 --> 08:12.156
If we both aren't into
it, we don't do it.

08:12.189 --> 08:13.024
Oh, come on.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.961
We need to come up
with something else.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.308
Hi.

08:30.341 --> 08:32.010
Hi.

08:32.043 --> 08:32.877
Dion to the butcher department.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.432
Dion to the butcher
department, please.

08:35.212 --> 08:36.649
I like your shoes.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.682
Thanks.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.022
Lola, what're you doing?

08:43.054 --> 08:44.589
Been looking everywhere for ya.

08:44.623 --> 08:45.991
Can we have this?

08:46.024 --> 08:47.960
We don't really need this, okay?

08:49.193 --> 08:51.296
You scared me half to death.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.233
I need you to stay with
me, all right, let's go.

09:00.038 --> 09:01.840
How about some candy?

09:01.873 --> 09:03.208
I can do some candy.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.597
Not saying this isn't risky,

09:25.630 --> 09:27.165
but our strategy is proven.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.302
We've consistently
outperformed the market.

09:30.335 --> 09:32.204
We see returns of
upwards of 15 to 20%

09:32.236 --> 09:34.206
in a very short timeframe.

09:34.239 --> 09:35.774
I don't know.

09:35.807 --> 09:37.643
I've never done
anything this bullish.

09:37.676 --> 09:40.846
Look, you found us, not
because you wanna be safe.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.316
You wanna get off
the sidelines, right?

09:44.349 --> 09:46.252
All it takes is
making the right moves.

09:47.385 --> 09:49.322
We'll be with you
every step of the way.

09:50.688 --> 09:53.925
Oh, God, ah, what
can you do with 50?

10:19.418 --> 10:20.418
Hello, Micah.

10:21.385 --> 10:22.385
Who are you?

10:50.048 --> 10:53.351
Your brother,
he's very charming,

10:53.384 --> 10:56.688
and well, I'll
admit it, he got me.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.458
He got me.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.125
What're you talking about?

11:01.158 --> 11:03.961
Brass tacks, Micah here,

11:03.995 --> 11:05.998
made off with 100
grand of my money,

11:07.065 --> 11:10.769
and I'm gonna need to get
repaid one way or another.

11:10.802 --> 11:12.037
I'm gonna get you your money.

11:12.070 --> 11:12.871
I just need more time.

11:12.903 --> 11:13.938
No!

11:21.446 --> 11:26.285
That reminds me of my dog.

11:27.284 --> 11:28.219
She makes the same face

11:28.253 --> 11:30.923
when she does something
she's not supposed to.

11:32.157 --> 11:35.160
I'll lock her in
her cage for days.

11:35.192 --> 11:37.361
She'll whine and whine
and she'll soil herself,

11:37.394 --> 11:39.064
but I don't pay her any mind.

11:40.131 --> 11:41.131
It's just a dog.

11:42.466 --> 11:44.903
Animals, they feel the shame.

11:47.172 --> 11:51.343
They need to wallow in it
to know the consequences.

11:53.979 --> 11:54.979
Right, Micah?

12:25.376 --> 12:27.746
Vaughn, what's the deal?

12:30.347 --> 12:32.416
I told you she has
nothing to do with this.

12:32.450 --> 12:37.223
Hi, people take their
hearing for granted.

12:38.123 --> 12:39.425
It's actually quite fragile.

12:41.025 --> 12:42.927
Takes the right amount
of extended pressure

12:42.961 --> 12:44.529
to cause lasting damage.

12:45.864 --> 12:49.100
About 140 decibels can take out

12:49.134 --> 12:52.204
roughly half your
hearing in 20 minutes.

12:53.270 --> 12:54.372
No, please.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.145
Is it true what
they say about twins?

13:01.346 --> 13:02.413
Can you feel his pain?

13:08.385 --> 13:09.587
About 140 decibels.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.023
No, please!

13:12.857 --> 13:13.457
No, stop!

13:13.490 --> 13:14.393
250!

13:14.426 --> 13:16.295
Stop, no, please, stop!

13:16.327 --> 13:17.562
We don't have it, I swear!

13:22.567 --> 13:24.970
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, Vaughn, Vaughn, Vaughn!

13:25.003 --> 13:26.472
$200,000, all right?

13:31.009 --> 13:32.211
200?

13:32.244 --> 13:33.524
It's double your money, 200,000.

13:35.346 --> 13:40.351
Mm, what do you
think about that?

13:40.618 --> 13:41.552
Yeah.

13:41.586 --> 13:42.586
Yeah, yeah.

13:44.556 --> 13:46.225
You're in on this too now.

13:48.559 --> 13:51.196
I'm gonna give you 10
days to get me my money,

13:53.465 --> 13:54.867
or I will lock you up in a cage,

13:54.899 --> 13:56.534
and I'll never let you out.

14:05.910 --> 14:06.910
10 days.

14:30.999 --> 14:31.999
Where's the money?

14:34.038 --> 14:35.038
I lost it.

14:39.009 --> 14:40.913
You need to get outta here.

14:43.181 --> 14:44.250
This is on me.

14:45.582 --> 14:46.517
I'm not gonna bail on you.

14:46.551 --> 14:47.586
You have to.

14:49.354 --> 14:51.523
What happened today
is just the beginning.

14:51.556 --> 14:54.158
I don't know what
this guy's capable of.

14:54.192 --> 14:58.496
Look, I don't trust
you, but I love you, okay?

15:01.732 --> 15:03.434
I guess it's time to swing big.

15:09.506 --> 15:13.245
Okay, we are God's workers.

15:14.278 --> 15:16.048
So, angels.

15:17.048 --> 15:18.317
Yes, exactly, angels.

15:21.052 --> 15:23.254
We need to keep it
grounded, very realistic.

15:23.288 --> 15:24.690
This is a business deal, okay?

15:24.722 --> 15:26.657
We have a direct line to God,

15:26.691 --> 15:28.494
and he can ask
anything he wants.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.964
With the right price,
we'll give him an answer.

15:34.631 --> 15:36.067
We need to gain his trust.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.601
Make it believable.

15:37.634 --> 15:40.271
Sure, find out what
this guy really wants.

16:30.721 --> 16:31.756
Mr. Elwood!

16:34.225 --> 16:35.225
Mr. Elwood!

16:40.532 --> 16:41.532
Hi!

16:44.635 --> 16:46.337
Ah, I'm Clint Chambers,

16:46.370 --> 16:48.240
and this is my associate,
Samantha Crowley.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.542
May we have a
moment of your time?

16:50.575 --> 16:51.575
What?

16:52.677 --> 16:53.778
Can we talk?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.482
About what?

16:57.514 --> 16:58.793
We'd like to
discuss the incident

16:58.817 --> 17:00.719
that happened at Saint Teresa!

17:10.728 --> 17:14.332
I've already apologized
to Father Paul.

17:14.365 --> 17:15.834
I'm sure the Father
appreciated that,

17:15.866 --> 17:18.302
but we're actually here to
discuss a different matter.

17:20.637 --> 17:22.340
Please, it's very important.

17:25.175 --> 17:27.111
Wait a minute, I
know what this is.

17:29.547 --> 17:31.316
Yeah, follow me.

17:42.727 --> 17:43.727
Wait here.

17:45.663 --> 17:50.836
Is that a La Roche?

17:51.403 --> 17:52.871
Is it worth anything?

17:52.903 --> 17:54.743
Yeah, I mean, this alone
could pay back Vaughn.

17:55.772 --> 17:56.841
Maybe we just take this.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.845
I mean that's if
it's an original.

17:59.877 --> 18:01.679
Why would a guy
like him have a fake?

18:01.712 --> 18:04.816
20 grand, this should be enough

18:04.848 --> 18:06.784
to keep this from
becoming a real headache.

18:06.817 --> 18:07.985
Don't you think?

18:08.019 --> 18:11.323
If there's one thing I hate
more than clergy, it's lawyers,

18:11.355 --> 18:13.291
so please, all right,

18:14.424 --> 18:17.863
tell Jesus I said I'm
sorry, forgive me.

18:19.463 --> 18:20.698
Don't worry, I won't be back.

18:34.311 --> 18:35.880
God doesn't want your money.

18:37.582 --> 18:40.886
This is a 1962 bottle of scotch.

18:42.653 --> 18:46.692
It was a birthday gift
from my wife, my ex-wife.

18:49.861 --> 18:51.597
It's an $800 bottle.

18:53.498 --> 18:57.736
I drank four and change
this morning, so please,

18:57.769 --> 19:02.673
forgive me if I'm not
understanding you correctly.

19:03.907 --> 19:04.708
I think your
understanding me just fine.

19:04.741 --> 19:05.743
God heard you.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.580
He wants to talk with you.

19:08.613 --> 19:11.249
God wants to speak
to me in person.

19:11.281 --> 19:16.288
In person, no smoke and
mirrors, no burning bush.

19:18.923 --> 19:21.527
Just you and God face to face.

19:22.926 --> 19:25.829
So you two are...

19:25.863 --> 19:26.932
God's workers.

19:26.964 --> 19:28.399
Angels.

19:28.432 --> 19:29.567
You could say that.

19:35.306 --> 19:38.509
I've meditated on the
banks of the Ganges.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.811
I got naked with
Digambara Monks.

19:42.012 --> 19:45.884
I was audited by a
operating thetan.

19:46.617 --> 19:50.221
I drank Ayahuasca with
a Brazilian shaman

19:50.255 --> 19:55.227
all in an attempt to
get some response.

19:57.494 --> 19:58.930
Nothing, silence.

20:00.897 --> 20:03.367
Now you two show up at my door

20:03.401 --> 20:08.307
and tell me all of a sudden
God wants to talk to me

20:09.273 --> 20:10.908
face to face just like that?

20:12.410 --> 20:13.410
Just like that.

20:19.616 --> 20:22.287
Where would that happen?

20:24.355 --> 20:26.724
Right here in your home.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.463
Look, the front
door's over there.

20:33.830 --> 20:36.667
As angels you might
wanna fly out.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.502
There is a skylight
in the kitchen.

20:43.607 --> 20:46.611
Mr. Elwood, we
would like to stay in touch.

20:47.578 --> 20:51.649
God is waiting in case
you change your mind.

21:45.603 --> 21:47.372
We just walked
away from an easy 20 grand.

21:47.404 --> 21:48.807
I thought it was
the smarter choice.

21:48.839 --> 21:49.807
The smarter choice?

21:49.840 --> 21:51.609
I was thinking about that safe.

21:54.912 --> 21:56.013
He's unbanked, all right?

21:56.047 --> 21:59.584
So I mean he had to have
gotten that 20,000 from a safe.

22:01.786 --> 22:03.555
Doesn't matter now anyway.

22:03.587 --> 22:04.788
This was a stupid lead.

22:04.821 --> 22:06.301
I mean just a waste
of time and money.

22:11.095 --> 22:12.095
Hello?

22:14.531 --> 22:15.634
Yes, of course.

22:18.403 --> 22:19.971
Sorry, ah, where did you say?

22:21.905 --> 22:25.609
Yes, I'm positive we
can make that happen.

22:27.545 --> 22:30.515
Okay, yes, see you then.

22:32.884 --> 22:33.884
What'd he say?

22:34.852 --> 22:35.653
He wants a meeting.

22:35.685 --> 22:36.685
No way.

22:37.954 --> 22:41.692
Yeah, Tuesday, 10 a.m.,
rooftop at Hotel Alessandra.

22:43.059 --> 22:44.863
I can't believe it.

22:46.431 --> 22:47.766
What do we do now?

22:48.833 --> 22:49.968
We gotta find God.

22:57.974 --> 23:02.045
All right, next up it'll be
couples skate, ladies choice.

23:02.078 --> 23:03.481
Don't be shy.

23:14.157 --> 23:17.861
I'll be, boys and girls,
look who just walked in,

23:17.894 --> 23:21.766
the king and queen of Franks's
Roller Rink have returned.

23:21.798 --> 23:23.032
Micah's record still stands.

23:23.034 --> 23:26.771
Lysoling 122 pairs of
skates in 32 seconds,

23:26.804 --> 23:29.974
and who could forget Rachel's
amazing blind double lutz.

23:30.007 --> 23:31.009
Still uncontested.

23:32.876 --> 23:36.079
Jesus.

23:36.113 --> 23:37.081
Hey, Frank.

23:37.114 --> 23:38.482
Hey.

23:39.517 --> 23:40.684
Hola, Jesus.

23:40.718 --> 23:43.086
Hola, Rachel, Micah.

23:46.857 --> 23:48.091
Stupid slushie machine.

23:48.125 --> 23:49.136
Can never stay on top of it.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.894
Still got Jesus, huh?

23:50.928 --> 23:54.732
Oh yeah, oh, he ran the
place when I was away.

23:54.765 --> 23:56.067
The profits went up 20%.

23:56.099 --> 23:58.002
The guy is very resourceful.

23:59.135 --> 24:01.172
We should've visited you.

24:01.204 --> 24:03.008
Nah, it's, that's, that's fine.

24:03.842 --> 24:07.211
So, what do I owe
this lovely surprise?

24:08.179 --> 24:09.080
Um.

24:09.113 --> 24:11.482
Could we talk in the back?

24:11.516 --> 24:14.052
Look, you know I'm, I'm
on the square now, right?

24:14.852 --> 24:17.221
We need to talk
to you about God.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.759
Oh no, oh, I was afraid of this.

24:22.792 --> 24:27.798
Who got ya, Jehovah's Witnesses,
bicycle guys, Scientology?

24:30.902 --> 24:32.871
Well, tell us what you think?

24:36.773 --> 24:37.975
Say something.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.111
I have no words.

24:40.144 --> 24:42.046
Look, we know it's not sane.

24:42.078 --> 24:43.714
Yeah, a meeting with God.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.583
It's ambitious.

24:45.615 --> 24:49.186
No, no, Kansas
City, the Finkel job,

24:49.220 --> 24:51.588
Boise, they were ambitious.

24:51.622 --> 24:54.659
This is professionally
speaking, bonkers.

24:55.926 --> 24:57.628
We need you, Frank.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.230
I'm not going back to prison.

25:00.798 --> 25:02.232
It was nice seeing you guys.

25:02.266 --> 25:04.067
Enjoy a skate on the
house before you leave.

25:04.101 --> 25:05.270
It's lucrative.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.872
Yeah, well, it always is.

25:09.673 --> 25:11.608
Come on, Frank, throw us a bone.

25:11.642 --> 25:13.244
We're in over our heads.

25:13.277 --> 25:14.645
Well, guys, I'm sorry.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.281
I'm, I'm not interested.

25:16.314 --> 25:17.949
I'm clean as a whistle.

25:17.981 --> 25:20.519
Wait, we didn't even tell
you the best part, okay?

25:23.054 --> 25:24.054
He's unbanked.

25:25.655 --> 25:27.057
Hmm.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.091
That's mean...

25:28.125 --> 25:29.227
I know what it means.

25:29.259 --> 25:30.595
He's got a safe.

25:30.627 --> 25:32.029
He's got a safe you say.

25:32.063 --> 25:32.931
Yeah.

25:32.963 --> 25:33.764
And you've seen it?

25:33.798 --> 25:35.032
No, we have not.

25:35.066 --> 25:38.269
Well, okay, not exactly,

25:38.301 --> 25:40.203
but we think we
know where it is.

25:40.237 --> 25:41.773
Guys, I
don't know the first thing

25:41.806 --> 25:43.040
about breaking into a safe.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.275
How hard can it be?

25:44.307 --> 25:45.876
If it wasn't it
wouldn't be a safe.

25:45.910 --> 25:47.211
Oh, really?

25:47.243 --> 25:48.245
Yeah.

25:48.278 --> 25:49.681
Thank you.

25:49.713 --> 25:50.924
You're the one who
said it wouldn't be hard.

25:50.948 --> 25:52.158
Guys, guys, it's
nice to see you two

25:52.182 --> 25:54.285
getting along so well.

25:54.317 --> 25:56.186
Now as fun as this
sounds, I'm out.

26:00.324 --> 26:01.125
Well, it was good seeing you.

26:01.157 --> 26:02.961
Yeah, you too, come anytime.

26:05.229 --> 26:06.998
Missing out, old man.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.030
Maybe.

26:19.276 --> 26:21.144
How long do you give him?

26:21.178 --> 26:23.949
Mm, 30, 40 seconds.

26:28.085 --> 26:29.587
You don't good, Frankie boy.

26:32.288 --> 26:35.660
Uh oh, uh oh, better
get out, move out of the way.

26:35.692 --> 26:37.996
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

26:38.028 --> 26:39.730
Oh God, come here,
sweetie, come here.

26:39.763 --> 26:41.031
I'll help you, come here.

26:41.065 --> 26:42.166
Everyone, watch out!

26:43.233 --> 26:44.234
Clean it up!

26:47.238 --> 26:48.273
Hey!

26:51.976 --> 26:54.278
This doesn't involve
national parks, public pools,

26:54.310 --> 26:55.980
or the state of
Florida, does it?

26:56.012 --> 26:58.316
What, ah, no.

26:59.083 --> 27:02.220
When's the first meeting?

27:03.153 --> 27:05.355
May I ask what's the occasion?

27:05.388 --> 27:07.391
Well, they say dress
for the job you want.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.894
Is a custom
suit really necessary?

27:10.928 --> 27:12.363
Dear child, you need not worry.

27:12.395 --> 27:13.439
For I have the whole world...

27:13.463 --> 27:14.698
Hold still just for a second.

27:14.731 --> 27:16.033
Look, Frank, um,

27:17.035 --> 27:18.745
I think I'm gonna have to
agree with Micah on this one.

27:18.769 --> 27:21.838
Who taught you
everything you know?

27:21.872 --> 27:23.807
Now, repeat after me, in Frank.

27:25.409 --> 27:27.245
In Frank.

27:27.278 --> 27:28.913
I trust.

27:28.945 --> 27:30.380
I trust.

27:30.413 --> 27:32.850
I trust.

27:34.484 --> 27:37.788
Says here he sold
his tech company in 2007

27:37.821 --> 27:40.023
for just over 500 million.

27:40.057 --> 27:41.759
Started from the ground up.

27:41.791 --> 27:43.260
Self-made man like me.

27:43.294 --> 27:46.864
After that there's not much.

27:46.896 --> 27:49.000
What was his demeanor
when you met him?

27:49.032 --> 27:49.833
Mental.

27:49.866 --> 27:51.802
Gee, well, obviously.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.005
Otherwise he wouldn't be
going along with this.

27:54.038 --> 27:55.940
Maybe there's more to
this guy than you think.

27:56.640 --> 27:57.775
Any art in the house?

27:57.807 --> 27:58.776
He's got a La Roche.

27:58.808 --> 27:59.410
He's got good taste.

27:59.442 --> 28:01.311
That's always dangerous.

28:01.345 --> 28:02.779
Don't get me wrong.

28:02.813 --> 28:04.482
It's a big house,
but not that big.

28:04.515 --> 28:06.317
Conservative buy in my opinion.

28:06.349 --> 28:07.150
And the wife?

28:07.183 --> 28:08.985
Ah, divorced.

28:09.019 --> 28:09.953
That happens.

28:09.987 --> 28:10.788
What happens?

28:10.820 --> 28:12.423
Grief causes divorce.

28:12.455 --> 28:15.459
My second wife left me when
our Shih Tzu, Dottie, died.

28:17.027 --> 28:18.096
Man, I miss that dog.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.431
Why here?

28:21.464 --> 28:23.201
No idea.

28:23.233 --> 28:25.202
Did you guys ever
go to Sunday school?

28:25.236 --> 28:26.437
No.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.271
Just wanna see what I
got to work with here.

28:28.305 --> 28:29.907
You?

28:29.940 --> 28:34.077
10 years of Catholic school
till they kicked me out at 15.

28:34.111 --> 28:38.082
Expelled, excommunicated, and
one other ex I can't remember.

28:38.115 --> 28:38.915
Wow.

28:38.949 --> 28:39.949
She was worth it.

28:41.317 --> 28:43.887
This is definitely a challenge.

28:43.921 --> 28:45.423
Would take a lot
for me to believe

28:45.455 --> 28:48.225
I was sitting across from
the creator of the universe.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.260
We're gonna have to get
him under the ether.

28:50.294 --> 28:51.763
Elicit an emotional response.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.297
Make him believe.

28:53.329 --> 28:55.465
Yeah, but this is insanity.

28:55.499 --> 28:58.336
Really, have you
ever read the Bible?

28:58.368 --> 29:01.204
It's chock full of what
you'd call insanity.

29:01.238 --> 29:03.875
People turning into
salt, talking donkeys,

29:03.907 --> 29:06.510
channeling of spirits, people
coming back from the dead.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.945
Channeling of spirits.

29:07.978 --> 29:09.447
Sounds like you know a lot.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.049
And so should you
if we're gonna pull this off.

29:13.317 --> 29:14.786
Good Morgan Freeman, huh?

29:14.818 --> 29:18.388
Nah, cliche, something
more classic like Heston.

29:18.422 --> 29:20.324
He played Moses, not God.

29:20.356 --> 29:23.795
Oh, right, oh,
George Burns then.

29:23.827 --> 29:25.462
Why does it have to be a man?

29:25.496 --> 29:29.467
Good point, well, God
is everything, everywhere.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.402
In the wind, in the
trees, in music.

29:31.434 --> 29:33.171
Right, but how are
we gonna do that?

29:33.203 --> 29:34.305
We gotta stay practical.

29:34.338 --> 29:38.341
The character of God, he
subscribes to the ooh theory.

29:38.375 --> 29:41.412
Omniscient,
omnipresent, omnipotent.

29:42.311 --> 29:45.182
Well, he's all powerful,
dogmatic, opulent.

29:45.215 --> 29:48.318
Smart, and always
10 steps ahead.

29:48.352 --> 29:49.253
Yeah, but a good listener.

29:49.286 --> 29:50.520
He's empathetic.

29:50.554 --> 29:52.523
Of course, we don't
have to give him

29:52.556 --> 29:55.526
the God of the Bible
or the Quran or Oprah.

29:55.558 --> 29:58.863
We just need to give
him the God he wants.

30:01.432 --> 30:05.170
This just might work.

30:32.896 --> 30:34.499
How can you not
feel for this guy?

30:37.166 --> 30:42.005
Yeah, sure, ah, it's
very tragic, whatever.

30:46.309 --> 30:47.577
I don't know.

30:47.611 --> 30:50.348
I don't go around begging
for attention, you know?

30:50.381 --> 30:53.484
Whining about things
that have happened to me.

30:55.051 --> 30:56.286
The world burns everyone.

30:57.421 --> 31:01.226
Life sucks and nothing
really matters.

31:03.227 --> 31:06.264
Well, actually, there's one
thing that matters, money.

31:08.097 --> 31:09.097
You know why?

31:10.099 --> 31:12.569
Because money
creates opportunity.

31:12.603 --> 31:13.638
Exactly.

31:21.644 --> 31:24.214
Have you ever wondered
what it would've been like

31:24.248 --> 31:26.985
to actually have a dad?

31:28.618 --> 31:30.554
You know, how things
would've turned out for us?

31:34.057 --> 31:36.126
You'd be a rock star.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.197
I'd manage a billion
dollar hedge fund.

31:45.669 --> 31:46.604
Where you going?

31:46.636 --> 31:48.940
I'm just gonna clear
my head before tomorrow.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.375
Don't stay out too late.

31:52.409 --> 31:53.409
Okay, Dad.

33:04.080 --> 33:08.718
He was literally sitting
right there, two seats from me.

33:08.751 --> 33:09.653
Did you talk to him?

33:09.685 --> 33:11.221
No, he didn't talk to him.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.723
You don't, you
don't talk to him.

33:12.756 --> 33:14.767
You don't go up to McCartney
and interrupt his dinner.

33:14.791 --> 33:16.659
Oh, you should've
went up to him and gone,

33:16.692 --> 33:19.163
are you the lead
singer of Wings?

33:19.195 --> 33:20.195
Right?

33:22.432 --> 33:24.167
It's The Beatles.

33:24.201 --> 33:25.403
Oh my gosh, babe.

33:25.435 --> 33:27.504
That's okay, you're right.

33:27.538 --> 33:28.372
Oh, you're cute though.

33:28.404 --> 33:29.373
Is there another band?

33:29.405 --> 33:30.307
Yes, another band.

33:30.339 --> 33:31.274
Am I dumb?

33:31.307 --> 33:32.742
No.

33:32.776 --> 33:34.420
No, you're, you're,
it's okay, it's all right.

33:34.444 --> 33:36.614
Well, thanks for coming tonight.

33:36.646 --> 33:39.049
That was really cool
to see you out there.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.651
Of course, you
guys were awesome.

33:40.683 --> 33:43.354
Just needed a night out.

33:43.386 --> 33:44.587
I hope the money helps.

33:44.621 --> 33:48.826
Oh yeah, yes, thank
you, super generous.

33:48.858 --> 33:50.660
Of course.

34:16.253 --> 34:17.555
You're late.

34:17.588 --> 34:18.756
Yeah, like a minute.

34:18.789 --> 34:20.724
I need you all in.

34:20.757 --> 34:21.826
I'm here, aren't I?

34:24.894 --> 34:26.262
Where'd you go last night?

34:26.295 --> 34:27.731
Just walked around.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.400
Right.

34:33.369 --> 34:34.369
Here.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.508
Put this in your ear.

34:39.309 --> 34:40.311
How's that feel?

34:41.210 --> 34:42.112
Good.

34:42.146 --> 34:43.547
Hello, Rachel.

34:43.579 --> 34:44.579
Frank?

34:46.349 --> 34:47.650
Frank.

34:47.684 --> 34:50.221
He wants to go by.

34:50.253 --> 34:51.154
Oh, God.

34:51.188 --> 34:53.324
Do not use my name in vain.

34:53.356 --> 34:55.326
Good one, how you feeling?

34:56.492 --> 34:57.503
I'm the creator of the universe.

34:57.527 --> 34:58.328
How do you think I feel?

34:58.362 --> 35:00.331
Mm, nervous?

35:00.364 --> 35:01.432
And a little gassy.

35:04.568 --> 35:05.568
It's time.

35:31.527 --> 35:32.529
He's up there?

35:33.931 --> 35:34.931
Please follow us.

35:59.255 --> 36:00.456
I miss the white suits.

36:00.489 --> 36:02.926
That was, that was a good touch.

36:06.362 --> 36:11.368
Okay, this is gonna be good.

36:13.936 --> 36:15.472
I hope he's in a good mood.

36:17.273 --> 36:19.409
It's nice of him to
make time in his day.

36:38.862 --> 36:39.896
Right.

36:54.543 --> 36:55.746
Eagle's left the nest.

37:34.650 --> 37:35.650
Ben.

37:41.490 --> 37:42.860
Not what you were expecting.

37:47.364 --> 37:48.364
Have a seat.

38:00.010 --> 38:01.478
What if I don't want to?

38:01.510 --> 38:02.612
A free will man.

38:02.646 --> 38:03.646
I like it.

38:08.751 --> 38:10.954
So you're God.

38:10.987 --> 38:12.023
That's right.

38:13.422 --> 38:14.422
Which one?

38:15.625 --> 38:16.625
There's only one.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.933
What am I thinking right now?

38:23.967 --> 38:24.967
That I'm not God.

38:28.538 --> 38:30.606
All right, that was a layup.

38:30.639 --> 38:35.645
That ah, what did I
have for breakfast?

38:36.512 --> 38:37.748
I don't like to be tested.

38:40.016 --> 38:41.418
That's what I thought.

38:43.052 --> 38:47.958
You were born on October
11th, 1971 at 4:32 a.m.

38:47.990 --> 38:50.693
You have a birthmark on
your left butt cheek,

38:50.726 --> 38:53.396
and a mole on your back
you should get looked at.

38:53.429 --> 38:55.898
Your Aunt Regina's
dog is named Cuddles,

38:55.931 --> 38:58.468
and this morning you
had two pieces of bacon,

38:58.501 --> 39:01.971
expired yogurt, and a
generous pour of bourbon.

39:02.005 --> 39:05.376
So do you wanna
keep playing games,

39:05.409 --> 39:07.111
or get to the real
reason we're here?

39:09.179 --> 39:11.414
I know the number of
hairs on your head, Ben.

39:11.447 --> 39:14.050
Stop worrying and
know that you're worth

39:14.083 --> 39:15.985
more than many sparrows.

39:22.425 --> 39:24.795
You've been looking for
me for a long time now.

39:26.195 --> 39:27.195
Sure.

39:30.065 --> 39:32.034
So what's this
really gonna cost me?

39:32.068 --> 39:34.672
I think they told you I
had no need of your money.

39:35.639 --> 39:36.740
But you're after something.

39:36.773 --> 39:38.041
I'm only after the truth.

39:41.445 --> 39:42.445
Makes two of us.

39:44.213 --> 39:45.213
Ask me.

39:45.981 --> 39:47.184
Ask you what?

39:47.217 --> 39:49.420
Ask me what you
came here to ask me.

39:51.086 --> 39:53.090
You wanna know why
your daughter died.

39:56.092 --> 39:57.094
Her name was Katie.

40:04.134 --> 40:06.771
You're either weak
or you're cruel.

40:08.103 --> 40:09.139
Which one is it.

40:10.172 --> 40:11.607
I can't answer that question.

40:11.641 --> 40:12.543
Why not?

40:12.576 --> 40:13.686
Because I'm neither of those.

40:13.710 --> 40:15.012
Well, it's one or the other.

40:16.179 --> 40:17.247
What makes you think that?

40:17.280 --> 40:19.784
Because you're either unable
to do anything about it,

40:20.983 --> 40:23.052
or you just don't
care, maybe both.

40:26.222 --> 40:28.759
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

40:28.791 --> 40:30.427
Keep to the script, Frank.

40:35.130 --> 40:37.099
You still haven't
asked the real question.

40:37.132 --> 40:39.669
That potent three
letter word, why.

40:39.702 --> 40:42.206
Because you're not gonna give
me the real answer, are you?

40:44.773 --> 40:46.543
You enjoy watching
people suffer.

40:48.677 --> 40:49.679
That's it, isn't it?

40:51.081 --> 40:53.684
You're just some glorified
celestial psychopath.

40:54.751 --> 40:55.751
You're not good.

40:57.086 --> 41:01.090
If you're good, stop me
from jumping off the roof.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.231
We have a situation here.

41:08.264 --> 41:09.766
Eagle wants to fly.

41:15.539 --> 41:16.539
Come on!

41:18.807 --> 41:20.210
Let the coward fly.

41:20.242 --> 41:21.043
What?

41:21.077 --> 41:21.912
Say what?

41:21.945 --> 41:22.846
That's great.

41:22.878 --> 41:24.047
Frank, stop him.

41:29.119 --> 41:30.621
Ben, here's the thing.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.222
I'm not gonna stop you

41:33.255 --> 41:35.125
from throwing yourself
off this rooftop.

41:36.992 --> 41:38.094
Frank, stop him.

41:41.231 --> 41:42.233
It's your choice,

41:44.233 --> 41:46.971
but I think we have more
to talk about, don't you?

42:00.684 --> 42:01.819
Can we meet again?

42:03.820 --> 42:06.690
Sure, but on my conditions.

42:06.722 --> 42:09.226
We meet at your house
away from high places.

42:14.931 --> 42:15.931
That's fine.

42:52.302 --> 42:53.871
I'll be in touch.

42:59.009 --> 43:00.009
Really?

43:00.943 --> 43:02.179
What's wrong?

43:02.211 --> 43:03.254
You were gonna let him jump.

43:03.278 --> 43:04.815
Come on, was not.

43:06.181 --> 43:07.384
Uh, there's a difference

43:07.416 --> 43:10.186
between killing someone
and robbing someone.

43:10.219 --> 43:11.320
He was gonna jump.

43:11.353 --> 43:12.355
I wasn't gonna kill him.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.692
Can we take a moment to admire

43:15.724 --> 43:17.326
what I just accomplished here?

43:17.360 --> 43:18.094
And what was that, Frank?

43:18.128 --> 43:20.063
We're in the house, that's what.

43:20.096 --> 43:23.967
Yes, but did you notice
the mastery, hmm, the wit,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.969
the waxing of the philosophical?

43:27.003 --> 43:28.939
I'm God, he bought it.

43:28.972 --> 43:30.107
Whatever you say, Frank.

43:30.139 --> 43:31.307
We got another meeting.

43:31.340 --> 43:32.385
The guy almost killed himself.

43:32.409 --> 43:35.211
Well, the man is
in a fragile state.

43:35.244 --> 43:36.279
Trust me, we're golden.

43:37.914 --> 43:40.083
Hey, where you going?

43:40.115 --> 43:41.251
Let her go.

43:41.284 --> 43:43.253
Let her decompress.

43:43.286 --> 43:45.389
Sometimes my presence
is overwhelming.

43:47.757 --> 43:48.757
There he is.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.853
Hello?

44:16.885 --> 44:18.755
You asleep?

44:18.788 --> 44:20.690
No, I'm pregnant.

44:20.724 --> 44:24.294
Um, well, I was wondering

44:24.327 --> 44:26.396
if I could maybe come over.

44:26.429 --> 44:30.067
Ah, sure, yeah,
that would be great.

44:30.099 --> 44:32.469
I mean I can't
really sleep anyway.

44:32.501 --> 44:34.141
Owen made some homemade
ice cream earlier.

44:34.170 --> 44:35.170
I know you want it.

44:36.072 --> 44:39.175
Cool, I'll
um, I'll see you soon.

44:40.143 --> 44:41.144
See you soon.

44:41.177 --> 44:42.177
Okay.

44:48.284 --> 44:53.456
So, the house was always
really strict and religious.

44:54.990 --> 44:56.893
For example, we could sing,

44:56.925 --> 44:58.894
but we couldn't
play instruments.

44:58.927 --> 44:59.730
What?

44:59.762 --> 45:00.797
That was a sin.

45:00.829 --> 45:01.731
Oh.

45:01.764 --> 45:03.400
So, I would go to my Nana's,

45:03.432 --> 45:04.867
and I would sneak
into the basement,

45:04.900 --> 45:08.404
and she had this
sick old Steinway,

45:08.438 --> 45:10.440
and a bunch of the
keys were out of tune,

45:10.472 --> 45:13.275
but that is where
I learned to play,

45:13.309 --> 45:16.346
and that's where I wrote
all my first songs.

45:16.378 --> 45:17.456
Gonna need to hear
all those songs.

45:17.480 --> 45:20.416
Oh, dude, I was 10.

45:20.449 --> 45:22.251
They're the worst
songs ever written.

45:22.284 --> 45:24.253
Exactly, that's
why I wanna hear them.

45:24.286 --> 45:26.088
So anyway, for our anniversary,

45:26.121 --> 45:30.193
Owen went to Mississippi
in a U-Haul truck,

45:31.494 --> 45:33.731
went to my Nana's house
and got the Steinway.

45:34.864 --> 45:36.066
And now I have it here.

45:36.099 --> 45:38.302
Still out of tune, but
I love it that way.

45:40.503 --> 45:41.739
Man, your life is nice.

45:44.873 --> 45:49.879
You and Owen and your music
and this house, the baby.

46:00.222 --> 46:01.759
This is my third pregnancy.

46:03.358 --> 46:07.364
The first one we
lost super early,

46:09.331 --> 46:10.331
which was hard.

46:11.333 --> 46:16.472
And then the second one, I
delivered him at 35 weeks.

46:19.474 --> 46:21.177
A stillborn baby boy.

46:23.478 --> 46:24.478
His name was Ethan.

46:30.353 --> 46:33.856
I'm realizing now I haven't
even said his name in so long.

46:36.025 --> 46:38.961
I'm sorry, I, I
didn't mean to...

46:46.068 --> 46:47.068
Your turn.

46:48.137 --> 46:49.172
What?

46:49.204 --> 46:51.375
You're not exactly an
open book, Emily.

46:53.543 --> 46:54.543
Um.

46:56.512 --> 46:57.548
Come on.

47:00.516 --> 47:01.818
Got a twin brother.

47:04.387 --> 47:07.391
Really, how do I not know that?

47:09.157 --> 47:10.460
And um,

47:17.199 --> 47:18.568
my dad bailed when I was two.

47:24.539 --> 47:25.875
I don't even know his name.

47:32.081 --> 47:37.086
And um, lost my mom
when I was eight.

47:42.291 --> 47:46.262
I found her on the
bathroom floor.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.135
I tried waking her up.

47:55.271 --> 47:56.271
She wouldn't.

48:00.208 --> 48:01.344
She didn't want to.

48:07.416 --> 48:08.552
She didn't want us.

48:15.257 --> 48:16.359
It broke my brother.

48:22.431 --> 48:23.532
So I had to be strong.

48:34.577 --> 48:36.446
I did what I had to to survive.

48:44.554 --> 48:46.023
I'm so sorry.

50:06.202 --> 50:08.104
What're you doing here?

50:08.137 --> 50:09.606
Do, do you have any coffee,

50:10.405 --> 50:13.110
or maybe something
a little stronger?

50:30.760 --> 50:32.129
I have to be honest.

50:33.262 --> 50:37.601
I'm very intrigued
by your line of work.

50:38.701 --> 50:40.336
Get your hands dirty.

50:42.704 --> 50:44.507
I like that.

50:45.608 --> 50:46.743
I got coffee.

50:48.677 --> 50:49.746
Micah.

50:50.679 --> 50:51.647
What're you doing here?

50:51.681 --> 50:52.682
I changed my mind.

50:52.715 --> 50:54.451
Changed your mind about what?

50:55.684 --> 50:56.719
Our deal.

50:58.753 --> 51:01.458
Something's come up and I
need my money in 48 hours.

51:01.490 --> 51:02.525
I hope that's okay.

51:03.626 --> 51:04.427
You can't do this.

51:04.460 --> 51:05.762
We had a deal.

51:05.795 --> 51:08.597
We're close, just give us
till the end of the week.

51:17.907 --> 51:20.309
I want my money.

51:50.239 --> 51:52.342
Sorry, I thought I
left this unlocked.

51:53.608 --> 51:54.608
Do you live here?

51:55.677 --> 51:57.646
No, of course not, come on.

52:01.784 --> 52:02.818
Coffee?

52:02.851 --> 52:03.853
I'm good.

52:07.757 --> 52:09.858
Blueprints to the mansion.

52:09.891 --> 52:10.893
Wow.

52:10.927 --> 52:12.562
So what're we looking at?

52:12.594 --> 52:14.230
Well, this is
where we think the safe is.

52:14.262 --> 52:16.865
Hmm, all right, we gotta find
out what kind of safe it is,

52:16.898 --> 52:20.702
combination, key,
fingerprint, rectal scan.

52:20.735 --> 52:22.571
You mean retina scan.

52:22.605 --> 52:23.806
What'd I say?

52:23.838 --> 52:25.741
Either way, it's
gotta be high-tech.

52:25.775 --> 52:28.545
Yeah, yeah, we gotta find
out the make and model,

52:28.577 --> 52:31.380
and ah, any clues as to
how to open the thing.

52:31.414 --> 52:32.382
And a third meeting.

52:32.414 --> 52:33.315
Yeah.

52:33.349 --> 52:35.218
Right, gotta up my God game.

52:36.219 --> 52:37.461
I think we should do a
reconnaissance mission.

52:37.485 --> 52:39.888
Yeah, scope the security out.

52:39.922 --> 52:42.257
Jesus, fire up the van, baby!

52:53.469 --> 52:55.938
Yeah, this message
is for Benjamin Elwood.

52:55.972 --> 52:58.274
City Power will be sending
out a trusted service provider

52:58.306 --> 53:00.275
this afternoon between
one and four p.m.

53:00.309 --> 53:03.479
This is a routine check and
you do not need to be present.

53:03.512 --> 53:04.512
Have a nice day.

53:39.447 --> 53:41.283
What do you think that is?

53:41.317 --> 53:42.485
Oh, that's a tower.

53:42.518 --> 53:43.753
For what?

53:43.786 --> 53:45.887
Maybe he's trying to
build his way to God.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.591
Like I said, nuts.

53:49.259 --> 53:50.927
Well, I got give cameras so far.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.561
There's probably more, here.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.510
I wonder how much cash
he's got in that safe?

53:59.534 --> 54:01.670
Oh, cash is boring.

54:01.704 --> 54:03.806
Best to stay away
from legal tender.

54:03.838 --> 54:04.940
What, why?

54:04.974 --> 54:07.844
Well, it's sloppy, traceable,

54:07.876 --> 54:09.945
and frankly a little unsexy.

54:09.978 --> 54:12.414
Yeah, cash is so unsexy.

54:12.447 --> 54:14.384
Jesus did a little digging

54:14.416 --> 54:15.985
and Mr. Unbanked Elwood

54:16.018 --> 54:18.954
turns out to be a
rare coin collector.

54:18.987 --> 54:20.123
What, like buffalo nickels?

54:20.155 --> 54:24.994
No, like a 1343 Florin that's
worth a cool 6.8 million.

54:26.661 --> 54:27.864
He has that?

54:27.896 --> 54:29.041
Yeah, according
to auction records,

54:29.065 --> 54:32.367
he has that and dozens
more of the same ilk.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.636
He's on the move.

55:01.764 --> 55:02.766
Well, that's weird.

55:04.500 --> 55:05.869
Maybe he's hot.

55:07.536 --> 55:09.938
Grief makes people
do strange things.

56:11.833 --> 56:13.402
We should stop.

56:13.436 --> 56:14.704
What, why?

56:14.737 --> 56:15.972
I don't know.

56:16.005 --> 56:17.749
There's just something
about him makes me feel...

56:17.773 --> 56:21.744
Feel, you're
feelings aren't real.

56:21.777 --> 56:23.713
You wanna know what's
real, that safe.

56:23.746 --> 56:24.680
Hmm.

56:24.713 --> 56:25.748
What's in that safe,

56:25.780 --> 56:27.091
and how it can directly
impact our situation, right?

56:27.115 --> 56:28.617
Back me up here, Frank.

56:28.650 --> 56:31.987
I know it's hard, but we
can't stop at this point.

56:32.021 --> 56:33.056
Why not?

56:34.489 --> 56:37.959
Oh, you know, I
remember the first time

56:37.992 --> 56:40.063
that you walked into the rink.

56:41.063 --> 56:43.832
My third divorce had just
finalized and I was in a funk,

56:43.865 --> 56:46.802
and in walks the saddest looking
little girl I'd ever seen.

56:48.070 --> 56:50.006
One minute I'm helping
this poor child,

56:50.039 --> 56:53.209
and the next I find
the register empty.

56:54.976 --> 56:58.013
It was a special feeling
being conned by two children.

56:58.813 --> 57:01.150
I knew we'd do special
things together.

57:02.784 --> 57:04.085
And when they put me away,

57:04.119 --> 57:06.088
I thought I'd never
see you guys again,

57:06.956 --> 57:09.025
but you come walking
back into the rink,

57:09.057 --> 57:10.760
and we're getting the
band back together.

57:10.793 --> 57:11.894
Can't stop now.

57:13.161 --> 57:16.465
Besides, it's the
role of a lifetime.

57:29.644 --> 57:32.047
Hey, Em, ah, I
went in for a checkup,

57:32.081 --> 57:33.615
and everything's okay,

57:33.648 --> 57:35.484
but they decided to
just keep me here.

57:35.518 --> 57:38.521
So letting everyone know
we're gonna induce labor

57:38.554 --> 57:40.056
probably tomorrow
or the next day.

57:40.088 --> 57:44.092
Ah, feel free to come by
if you want to, room 202.

58:08.751 --> 58:11.621
Sorry, I'm late, where's Rachel?

58:11.653 --> 58:13.121
On her way down I hope.

58:13.155 --> 58:16.626
Hey, if things go sideways
here, good with the audible?

58:16.659 --> 58:19.195
Feels more
like a Hail Mary to me.

58:19.228 --> 58:21.097
It'll work, just gotta sell it.

58:50.626 --> 58:52.695
Good afternoon, Mr.
Elwood, how are you?

58:55.164 --> 58:56.165
He's in the back.

59:10.045 --> 59:11.947
It's beautiful, Ben.

59:11.981 --> 59:12.981
Come, sit.

59:30.331 --> 59:31.232
I thought you said you wanted

59:31.266 --> 59:32.969
to stay away from high places.

59:40.141 --> 59:42.077
People get me all wrong.

59:42.110 --> 59:43.346
How so?

59:43.378 --> 59:45.347
They don't think I can feel.

59:45.380 --> 59:48.317
They don't think I can
relate to pain and suffering.

59:49.385 --> 59:51.187
They might be on to something.

59:52.820 --> 59:54.398
You don't think I have
emotion like you do?

59:54.422 --> 59:55.890
I have no idea.

59:55.923 --> 59:57.259
I created you in my image.

59:59.894 --> 1:00:01.730
I think we look nothing alike.

1:00:07.835 --> 1:00:09.270
I've done horrible things.

1:00:09.304 --> 1:00:12.141
Every sin under the sun,

1:00:12.173 --> 1:00:14.677
and I have been punished
for it and that's okay.

1:00:14.710 --> 1:00:16.144
I deserve it.

1:00:16.177 --> 1:00:19.214
But this new family, they
were my second chance.

1:00:21.182 --> 1:00:23.952
What you did to her was cruelty.

1:00:23.985 --> 1:00:26.221
That was cruelty beyond cruelty.

1:00:26.255 --> 1:00:28.057
You're not who
people think you are.

1:00:29.090 --> 1:00:30.159
You're a fraud.

1:00:35.396 --> 1:00:36.865
Are you familiar with Seurat?

1:00:38.233 --> 1:00:39.669
Think of this.

1:00:39.702 --> 1:00:42.271
Let's call it
theological pointillism.

1:00:42.304 --> 1:00:44.340
When you view his painting,

1:00:44.373 --> 1:00:48.144
A Sunday Afternoon on the Island
of La Grande Jatte closely,

1:00:49.344 --> 1:00:52.280
all you see is a mess
of spots and smudges.

1:00:52.313 --> 1:00:53.313
Doesn't make sense.

1:00:54.849 --> 1:00:56.318
But when you stand back 20 feet,

1:00:58.152 --> 1:01:03.091
you see a beautiful, ordered,
harmonious tapestry of art.

1:01:14.036 --> 1:01:18.007
If you look at life and
see spots and smudges.

1:01:19.407 --> 1:01:21.911
Perhaps you're presently
standing too close.

1:01:23.746 --> 1:01:25.247
But from a divine perspective,

1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:26.816
you'll see something beautiful.

1:01:29.451 --> 1:01:32.088
Frank, we're definitely
gonna need another meeting.

1:01:35.123 --> 1:01:36.358
1964.

1:01:39.961 --> 1:01:43.164
That's when the U.S. Mint
stop printing silver coins.

1:01:43.197 --> 1:01:47.804
I found this one on the
corner of 33rd and Broadway.

1:01:50.338 --> 1:01:51.807
It was right by a trashcan.

1:01:54.342 --> 1:01:56.244
I stopped to pick it up.

1:01:56.277 --> 1:01:57.879
My daughter didn't stop.

1:01:57.913 --> 1:01:59.248
She was hit by a box truck.

1:02:01.382 --> 1:02:02.317
And I held her in my arms

1:02:02.351 --> 1:02:04.454
while she was bleeding
out all over the street.

1:02:07.188 --> 1:02:08.790
Yeah, I'm taken this personally.

1:02:10.391 --> 1:02:14.797
Please spare me your
lectures on perspective.

1:02:16.431 --> 1:02:18.467
I'm sorry your daughter died.

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:20.869
No, you are sorry
for killing Katie!

1:02:20.902 --> 1:02:25.340
You are either everything
or you are nothing!

1:02:25.373 --> 1:02:26.274
Frank.

1:02:26.307 --> 1:02:27.143
Ben, we should meet again.

1:02:27.175 --> 1:02:28.210
No, we're done.

1:02:31.146 --> 1:02:32.248
Frank, go Hail Mary.

1:02:33.981 --> 1:02:35.317
I'll let you talk to her.

1:02:37.518 --> 1:02:38.518
What?

1:02:40.454 --> 1:02:43.491
I can let you talk to Katie.

1:02:49.931 --> 1:02:50.931
Rachel.

1:02:53.367 --> 1:02:54.402
Rachel.

1:02:55.336 --> 1:02:58.007
Come on, we're, we're sorry.

1:02:58.039 --> 1:02:59.942
We didn't tell you
about the backup plan.

1:02:59.974 --> 1:03:01.519
We didn't think it
was gonna come to this.

1:03:01.543 --> 1:03:03.077
Well, we hoped it wouldn't.

1:03:03.110 --> 1:03:04.012
Yeah.

1:03:04.045 --> 1:03:05.181
Talk to his dead daughter?

1:03:05.213 --> 1:03:06.081
This is a new low.

1:03:06.114 --> 1:03:07.316
Not to mention how.

1:03:08.617 --> 1:03:09.827
Micah, maybe
we should rethink...

1:03:09.851 --> 1:03:11.019
No, she's gonna do it.

1:03:11.052 --> 1:03:12.052
Do what?

1:03:14.021 --> 1:03:19.027
You're gonna have, have
to, um, play his daughter.

1:03:19.628 --> 1:03:20.429
What?

1:03:20.461 --> 1:03:22.097
Sorry, Rachel.

1:03:22.130 --> 1:03:25.601
Well, it's I guess, she's
gonna speak through you, right?

1:03:25.634 --> 1:03:27.235
Yeah, like a medium,

1:03:27.268 --> 1:03:30.271
kind of a channeling or
spirit type of thing.

1:03:30.304 --> 1:03:31.440
Subtle.

1:03:31.472 --> 1:03:35.110
You know, I expected something
like this from you, Micah,

1:03:35.143 --> 1:03:36.177
but not you, Frank.

1:03:36.210 --> 1:03:37.111
Rachel.

1:03:37.144 --> 1:03:39.014
No, he doesn't deserve this.

1:03:39.047 --> 1:03:40.817
No one deserves this.

1:03:43.985 --> 1:03:47.455
I so know where you are.

1:03:47.489 --> 1:03:51.427
Hmm, hmm, why is this light on?

1:03:52.393 --> 1:03:56.298
How strange, is someone
hiding in the toilet?

1:03:58.500 --> 1:04:00.302
What's that giggling?

1:04:00.335 --> 1:04:01.503
What is that giggling?

1:04:01.536 --> 1:04:02.503
Who is that?

1:04:02.536 --> 1:04:03.972
Who could that be?

1:04:04.005 --> 1:04:05.005
Who could that be?

1:04:07.108 --> 1:04:09.110
You're it, you're it,
you're it, you're it!

1:04:17.052 --> 1:04:22.057
She has every toy.

1:04:27.295 --> 1:04:28.364
You got a new piano,

1:04:28.396 --> 1:04:31.333
and all you wanna do is run
around in the sprinklers?

1:04:31.365 --> 1:04:32.534
Uh huh.

1:04:32.567 --> 1:04:34.469
Uh huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1:06:09.097 --> 1:06:10.199
Got extra egg rolls.

1:06:14.436 --> 1:06:15.637
What're you doing?

1:06:15.670 --> 1:06:17.239
What's it look like I'm doing?

1:06:18.306 --> 1:06:19.307
What about Vaughn?

1:06:21.275 --> 1:06:22.677
Well, you can't just bail.

1:06:22.710 --> 1:06:24.713
I can't do this anymore, Micah.

1:06:27.449 --> 1:06:31.019
Ah, is this about some
moral line we're crossing?

1:06:32.621 --> 1:06:34.155
When did you get so soft?

1:06:34.188 --> 1:06:35.623
When did you become so cruel?

1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:39.260
Hold on.

1:06:43.398 --> 1:06:44.398
Who do you think you are?

1:06:47.536 --> 1:06:48.704
Move.

1:06:48.737 --> 1:06:53.709
Face it, I'm the only one who
knows you, really knows you.

1:06:54.809 --> 1:06:56.144
And despite what you think,

1:06:56.177 --> 1:06:57.655
I'm the only one
that's protected you.

1:06:57.679 --> 1:07:00.548
The only person you've ever
looked out for was yourself.

1:07:03.717 --> 1:07:05.186
What's the real reason?

1:07:07.856 --> 1:07:08.856
Is it him?

1:07:10.224 --> 1:07:11.760
You think he deserves your pity?

1:07:13.094 --> 1:07:13.795
Move.

1:07:13.829 --> 1:07:15.798
You can go in a second.

1:07:15.831 --> 1:07:17.800
First, I need to
tell you a story.

1:07:19.101 --> 1:07:19.802
Trust me, you're gonna like it.

1:07:19.835 --> 1:07:21.603
It's about a guy, right?

1:07:21.635 --> 1:07:23.771
A deadbeat, a drunk,

1:07:23.804 --> 1:07:27.076
who knocks up this crazy
bartender with twins,

1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:34.817
but he couldn't handle
it, so he split.

1:07:35.650 --> 1:07:36.751
Never to be seen again.

1:07:38.652 --> 1:07:43.558
The mother never tells
the twins who he is,

1:07:43.592 --> 1:07:48.164
because she's so twisted.

1:07:49.731 --> 1:07:51.667
Turns out she couldn't
handle it either.

1:07:52.634 --> 1:07:55.771
She downs a bottle of pills,

1:07:57.672 --> 1:08:00.675
and leaves them like
their father did.

1:08:00.708 --> 1:08:02.143
Stop.

1:08:02.177 --> 1:08:05.681
Mm mm, because this
is where it gets good.

1:08:07.748 --> 1:08:10.718
One of the twins
found the deadbeat,

1:08:13.822 --> 1:08:15.691
and not in some back alley,

1:08:15.724 --> 1:08:18.828
but as a new man, a changed man.

1:08:21.529 --> 1:08:26.467
Went to AA, got sober, went
to church and found God

1:08:26.501 --> 1:08:29.838
who blessed him with
a beautiful family,

1:08:31.439 --> 1:08:36.445
and then he sells his
company and gets filthy rich,

1:08:40.748 --> 1:08:46.822
but the unexpected
happened, tragedy struck.

1:08:48.422 --> 1:08:53.328
He loses it all, the wife
and the daughter, his God.

1:09:13.782 --> 1:09:18.787
Nice try, this is your best
yet, but I don't believe you.

1:09:21.890 --> 1:09:23.526
I think you do.

1:09:27.295 --> 1:09:28.931
Not once did he grieve for us.

1:09:31.365 --> 1:09:35.503
You and I were nothing to him.

1:09:40.442 --> 1:09:41.777
He deserves everything he got!

1:09:45.247 --> 1:09:47.950
Mm hmm, and everything
he's got coming!

1:10:52.881 --> 1:10:55.517
Frank, did you know?

1:10:55.550 --> 1:10:56.418
What?

1:10:56.451 --> 1:10:57.918
Did you know?

1:10:57.952 --> 1:10:58.954
Know what?

1:10:59.887 --> 1:11:00.889
Ben.

1:11:10.497 --> 1:11:15.003
Micah played us like a fiddle.

1:11:20.908 --> 1:11:22.610
What am I supposed to do, Frank?

1:11:23.511 --> 1:11:24.647
Why are you asking me.

1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:28.884
Because you always seem to
have the answer to things.

1:11:28.917 --> 1:11:31.887
Well, just
because I've been convincingly

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.355
portraying the
knower of all things,

1:11:34.389 --> 1:11:36.057
doesn't mean I
actually know things.

1:11:44.798 --> 1:11:46.034
I never told you this before,

1:11:47.668 --> 1:11:49.938
but I lost my father
when I was 13.

1:11:50.904 --> 1:11:54.009
It's fascinating, the
power that fathers have,

1:11:54.042 --> 1:11:55.778
present or absent.

1:11:57.378 --> 1:12:00.882
Most of my memories of the
old man are broken promises,

1:12:03.917 --> 1:12:05.688
but he took me
roller skating once.

1:12:08.856 --> 1:12:09.957
It was a really good time.

1:12:12.659 --> 1:12:15.863
I always just
thought you liked disco.

1:12:15.896 --> 1:12:17.966
I hate disco.

1:12:23.872 --> 1:12:25.941
Kid, do what you gotta do.

1:12:27.908 --> 1:12:30.712
If you want revenge,
I'll help you.

1:12:34.114 --> 1:12:36.751
If you wanna call
it off, I'm good.

1:12:57.137 --> 1:13:01.475
Hey, hey, I'm actually
heading downstairs

1:13:01.509 --> 1:13:03.444
to get some pretty
terrible coffee.

1:13:03.478 --> 1:13:04.645
Do you want some?

1:13:04.679 --> 1:13:05.480
Ah, I'm good, thank you.

1:13:05.512 --> 1:13:06.113
You sure?

1:13:06.146 --> 1:13:07.548
Yeah.

1:13:07.582 --> 1:13:10.685
All right, let me
get this for you.

1:13:10.717 --> 1:13:11.586
Hey.

1:13:11.618 --> 1:13:14.589
Emily, how's it going?

1:13:16.190 --> 1:13:17.190
Ah.

1:13:19.594 --> 1:13:20.594
You okay?

1:13:24.599 --> 1:13:25.599
No.

1:13:27.836 --> 1:13:28.836
What's going on?

1:13:33.041 --> 1:13:37.078
I don't even
know where to start.

1:13:37.110 --> 1:13:39.448
Okay, talk to me.

1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:56.631
Look, I'm ah, I'm
not who you think I am.

1:14:01.802 --> 1:14:04.640
Okay, what does that mean?

1:14:11.712 --> 1:14:14.882
Ah, I think there's
a mix up here.

1:14:14.916 --> 1:14:16.150
I don't know what's going on.

1:14:16.184 --> 1:14:17.193
Ma'am, you're gonna
need to come with me.

1:14:17.217 --> 1:14:18.286
Why?

1:14:18.319 --> 1:14:20.522
The I.D. that she gave us
was flagged by our system.

1:14:22.657 --> 1:14:23.257
What does that mean?

1:14:23.291 --> 1:14:24.525
Ma'am, please.

1:14:24.559 --> 1:14:25.494
No, no, no, this is a mistake.

1:14:25.527 --> 1:14:26.560
She's our friend.

1:14:26.594 --> 1:14:28.029
This is our friend.

1:14:28.061 --> 1:14:28.829
I understand but your friend's
gonna have to come with me.

1:14:28.863 --> 1:14:29.764
No, she's fine.

1:14:29.796 --> 1:14:31.198
I just said she can stay.

1:14:31.231 --> 1:14:32.132
Ma'am,
ma'am, please now, come with me.

1:14:32.166 --> 1:14:32.934
Don't touch her.

1:14:32.966 --> 1:14:33.601
Okay, come on, please.

1:14:33.635 --> 1:14:34.202
Okay, okay.

1:14:34.234 --> 1:14:35.569
Do not touch her!

1:14:35.603 --> 1:14:36.337
She hasn't done
anything wrong, Emily.

1:14:36.371 --> 1:14:37.239
Ma'am, please, this way, please.

1:14:37.271 --> 1:14:38.271
I'm sorry.

1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:47.949
Hey, I'm Detective De Ritis.

1:14:47.981 --> 1:14:49.551
Hey, you guys are fast.

1:14:49.583 --> 1:14:51.185
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood,

1:14:51.219 --> 1:14:53.822
so when the call
went out, I came out.

1:14:53.854 --> 1:14:54.856
Is this her?

1:14:57.225 --> 1:14:59.027
You did a good job.

1:15:11.238 --> 1:15:12.740
Thanks, man.

1:15:12.774 --> 1:15:14.176
Yeah, no problem, anytime.

1:15:16.877 --> 1:15:18.279
Good to see you again, Rach.

1:15:20.814 --> 1:15:21.814
I had to do it.

1:15:23.885 --> 1:15:25.253
You got too close to the mark.

1:15:25.286 --> 1:15:27.689
They never
should've been a mark.

1:15:30.358 --> 1:15:32.961
I'm sorry, I know
they were your friends.

1:15:32.993 --> 1:15:34.328
How could you?

1:15:34.362 --> 1:15:37.632
For the same reason I
didn't tell you about Ben.

1:15:37.664 --> 1:15:39.268
You wouldn't have
gone through with it.

1:15:43.203 --> 1:15:44.203
I know you hate me.

1:15:47.007 --> 1:15:49.077
And I know you hate yourself,

1:15:49.109 --> 1:15:50.978
but that hate is misguided.

1:15:51.878 --> 1:15:54.115
Direct it to the person
that deserves it.

1:15:57.217 --> 1:15:59.186
This is our chance to take back

1:15:59.220 --> 1:16:00.822
everything that he took from us.

1:16:03.091 --> 1:16:04.091
He owes us.

1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:06.962
Plus I gotta know.

1:16:09.930 --> 1:16:10.930
Know what?

1:16:11.666 --> 1:16:15.869
I gotta know why.

1:16:15.903 --> 1:16:17.072
Why weren't we enough?

1:16:18.939 --> 1:16:21.309
Why didn't he come
back for us, huh?

1:16:23.243 --> 1:16:26.347
I mean what's so wrong with us?

1:16:36.923 --> 1:16:41.262
We do this tomorrow and
that's it for good, I swear.

1:16:48.770 --> 1:16:51.907
It's this or
Vaughn, your choice.

1:17:08.189 --> 1:17:09.189
Are you sure?

1:17:14.061 --> 1:17:19.001
If Rachel is hurt in this,
know that I will end you.

1:17:44.125 --> 1:17:45.326
I didn't have any candles,

1:17:45.359 --> 1:17:48.230
I don't know, potpourri,
incense, something.

1:17:50.997 --> 1:17:54.769
All right, Ben, close you eyes,

1:17:56.170 --> 1:17:59.440
and think of your
daughter, think of her.

1:18:21.295 --> 1:18:22.698
Now say her name.

1:18:28.301 --> 1:18:29.301
Katie.

1:18:54.261 --> 1:18:57.898
Katie, what would you
like to say to your father?

1:19:06.006 --> 1:19:07.274
Hello, Daddy.

1:19:14.247 --> 1:19:15.849
What's taking so long?

1:19:26.493 --> 1:19:27.862
How are you?

1:19:32.966 --> 1:19:33.966
I'm ah,

1:19:37.572 --> 1:19:38.840
I'm okay now.

1:19:42.844 --> 1:19:43.844
Hmm.

1:19:47.180 --> 1:19:48.349
Where are you?

1:19:58.592 --> 1:20:00.194
I'm right here.

1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:18.512
Um, I just wanna say
how much I love you,

1:20:20.448 --> 1:20:22.417
and how much I miss you,

1:20:22.449 --> 1:20:25.519
and how sorry I am
about what happened.

1:20:49.143 --> 1:20:51.246
Why did you leave me?

1:20:51.279 --> 1:20:52.388
Oh, sweetheart,
I didn't leave you.

1:20:52.412 --> 1:20:54.148
I didn't leave you.

1:20:56.917 --> 1:20:58.353
I tried to save you.

1:20:59.921 --> 1:21:01.021
I tried to save you.

1:21:01.055 --> 1:21:02.222
It should've been me.

1:21:02.256 --> 1:21:05.160
I should be, baby,
it should've been me.

1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:09.297
Then why didn't you look for me?

1:21:09.329 --> 1:21:10.597
I have looked for you.

1:21:10.631 --> 1:21:11.911
I have looked everywhere
for you.

1:21:14.034 --> 1:21:15.470
No, you didn't.

1:21:21.175 --> 1:21:23.445
Why didn't you love
me like you loved her?

1:21:30.016 --> 1:21:32.487
Who?

1:21:33.654 --> 1:21:34.654
What's going on?

1:21:38.024 --> 1:21:38.692
What is this?

1:21:38.725 --> 1:21:39.725
Ben.

1:21:55.076 --> 1:21:56.144
What're you doing?

1:21:56.176 --> 1:21:57.511
We almost had it.

1:21:57.545 --> 1:21:58.712
Open the safe.

1:21:58.746 --> 1:22:00.480
I told you
to wait for our signal.

1:22:00.514 --> 1:22:02.016
You planned this.

1:22:02.048 --> 1:22:03.283
Shut up, Frank!

1:22:03.317 --> 1:22:04.519
Your name is Frank?

1:22:05.485 --> 1:22:06.421
Open the safe.

1:22:06.453 --> 1:22:07.521
Micah.

1:22:07.555 --> 1:22:10.291
Do it, please, go ahead.

1:22:11.591 --> 1:22:13.627
Don't think I won't.

1:22:14.595 --> 1:22:15.630
Please.

1:22:18.666 --> 1:22:20.134
Rachel.

1:22:22.636 --> 1:22:25.406
This wasn't a part of the plan.

1:22:27.507 --> 1:22:31.578
All right, okay,
fine, excuse me.

1:22:43.623 --> 1:22:46.693
Much obliged, let's go.

1:22:51.599 --> 1:22:53.268
Just the cash and
coins, come on.

1:23:08.548 --> 1:23:11.685
Here, don't forget this.

1:23:27.801 --> 1:23:33.007
Angels, hmm, you know,
Satan was an angel.

1:23:41.347 --> 1:23:42.347
Come on, Rachel.

1:23:52.827 --> 1:23:56.064
Rachel, come on, Rachel.

1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:28.128
Why are you taking that?

1:24:28.162 --> 1:24:28.863
Is it worth anything?

1:24:28.895 --> 1:24:29.895
Just get in the car!

1:24:32.832 --> 1:24:35.302
Oh, he'll probably be all right.

1:24:35.336 --> 1:24:37.704
Just wake up with a bad
headache and an empty safe.

1:24:38.771 --> 1:24:39.807
Better get outta here.

1:24:44.377 --> 1:24:45.846
Rachel, we should go.

1:25:32.393 --> 1:25:34.261
Your brother is
quite the mastermind.

1:25:35.796 --> 1:25:36.597
It's my fault.

1:25:36.630 --> 1:25:37.699
I taught him too well.

1:25:38.798 --> 1:25:39.600
You didn't teach him that.

1:25:39.632 --> 1:25:42.436
That's just evil.

1:25:46.806 --> 1:25:47.806
Whatchu gonna do now?

1:25:50.711 --> 1:25:52.380
I don't know, you?

1:25:55.716 --> 1:25:57.452
Darling, I'm as lost as you are.

1:25:59.853 --> 1:26:00.755
You know what they say,

1:26:00.787 --> 1:26:02.322
whenever God closes a door.

1:26:02.355 --> 1:26:03.523
He opens a safe.

1:28:36.777 --> 1:28:38.878
You know they say imitation

1:28:38.912 --> 1:28:41.048
is the sincerest
form of flattery.

1:28:43.917 --> 1:28:47.055
All right, I'm sorry
about all that.

1:28:48.588 --> 1:28:49.588
Oh.

1:28:52.024 --> 1:28:55.095
I, I think this
might belong to you.

1:29:18.719 --> 1:29:19.920
Here you all go.

1:29:19.953 --> 1:29:20.788
Let me know if you
need anything, okay?

1:29:20.820 --> 1:29:22.555
Thank you.

1:30:00.894 --> 1:30:03.097
Rachel, we need
you to clear table three.

1:30:21.614 --> 1:30:24.117
Hey, forgot your wallet.

1:30:24.150 --> 1:30:26.186
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

1:30:27.186 --> 1:30:28.221
God bless you.

1:30:28.255 --> 1:30:31.525
Thanks.

1:30:41.068 --> 1:30:43.171
That seems like something
an angel would do.

1:30:47.807 --> 1:30:49.644
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1:30:55.148 --> 1:30:56.484
I'm ah, sorry.

1:31:04.157 --> 1:31:05.157
So am I.

1:31:09.162 --> 1:31:10.231
Can we talk?

1:31:15.068 --> 1:31:16.270
I'm in the middle of a shift.

1:31:16.302 --> 1:31:18.538
I don't get off for
a couple of hours.

1:31:18.572 --> 1:31:21.576
I'll wait if that's okay.

1:31:27.881 --> 1:31:28.881
Yeah.
