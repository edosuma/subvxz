WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:10.077
Oh, hey, Calvin.
Ready for our, uh, tee time.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.945
Oh, sorry.
Rain check, buddy.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.282
I'm missing a part
of the suspension kit

00:15.416 --> 00:16.684
for a '63 Impala.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.486
It was right here yesterday.

00:18.618 --> 00:21.088
Oh, well, uh...

00:23.923 --> 00:25.992
Is this it?

00:26.126 --> 00:28.461
No. That's the muffler.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.433
Right. Which is, uh...

00:33.533 --> 00:35.703
not part of the suspension?

00:35.835 --> 00:37.970
Very good.

00:38.106 --> 00:40.607
And tomorrow we'll work on
shapes and colors.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.377
Okay, well, I don't understand.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.279
Why don't you just
get a new suspension?

00:45.378 --> 00:48.348
Because it's an original
from 1963.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.049
I can't just jump in
a time machine

00:50.183 --> 00:51.819
and go back and get
another one.

00:51.951 --> 00:55.189
Besides, Black people don't like
to travel back in time.

00:56.789 --> 00:59.460
Hey, you know...

00:59.560 --> 01:01.994
you don't think it was
one of your employees, do you?

01:02.130 --> 01:03.731
No.

01:03.863 --> 01:06.534
I trust my guys completely.

01:08.001 --> 01:11.805
Which is why I hid
a bunch of cameras all around.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.641
Did you check the cameras?

01:16.543 --> 01:19.045
Di-- Did I-- Come--

01:19.180 --> 01:21.682
Did I check the cameras?
Really, Dave?

01:21.814 --> 01:23.216
That's the question
you gonna ask me?

01:23.350 --> 01:24.551
Did I check 'em?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.153
You didn't check
the cameras, did you?

01:26.254 --> 01:28.822
Look, I just got robbed, Dave.
Stop blaming the victim.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.992
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

01:33.093 --> 01:34.162
* Welcome to the hood. *

01:43.036 --> 01:44.837
Why is the footage so grainy?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.406
I don't know.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.341
These cameras were
state of the art

01:48.442 --> 01:50.610
when I bought 'em in '92.

01:50.743 --> 01:54.281
Calvin, I was 11 in 1992.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.917
My View-Master had
better resolution.

01:59.085 --> 02:01.555
Oh, there's the thief.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.191
Or is that a smudge?

02:03.290 --> 02:07.060
Well, that smudge is stealing
your car parts.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.028
Unbelievable, man.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.131
I mean, you work
and you struggle

02:11.264 --> 02:12.932
to make an honest living.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.736
And then some lowlife just feels
he can come and take it all.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.872
All right, well,
let's call the cops.
And tell 'em what?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.574
Find a working VCR,

02:21.709 --> 02:24.076
and fast-forward to the smudge?

02:24.211 --> 02:25.878
Well, what are we gonna do?

02:25.978 --> 02:27.548
We're just gonna let
this guy get away with it?

02:27.647 --> 02:31.151
No. The thief didn't take
all the parts, so he'll be back.

02:31.284 --> 02:33.120
And when he does,
I'm gonna be

02:33.253 --> 02:35.588
right here waiting on him
with my good friends

02:35.723 --> 02:38.125
law and order.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.461
And I'll be waiting
with my good friends

02:41.594 --> 02:44.097
Rizzoli and Isles.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.504
(quartz bowl droning)

02:51.639 --> 02:54.908
Everyone take a deep breath in
and hold it at the top.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.978
This will clear
your heart chakra.

02:59.111 --> 03:00.281
(doorbell rings)

03:00.413 --> 03:02.449
One sec.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.352
I've got to clear
my porch chakra.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.820
Hey, girl.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.622
Oh...
Oh, what?

03:09.757 --> 03:10.758
Are you having a party?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.860
Oh... no.

03:12.992 --> 03:15.462
Oh, no, just having a couple of
friends over; nobody you know.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.598
Hello, I'm Aria.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.165
Hey.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.100
Welcome, goddess.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.871
Ooh, you have a beautiful aura.

03:24.003 --> 03:25.473
Well, thank you.

03:26.606 --> 03:29.377
You know, I use cocoa butter.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.813
Well, you came just in time
for the tranquility

03:33.947 --> 03:35.716
sound bath.

03:35.848 --> 03:38.185
Okay. Well, what's that?

03:38.319 --> 03:40.487
Nothing you'd be
interested in.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.855
Plus, we're capped
at five people.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.158
Fire marshal stuff.
Oh.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.627
Gemma, there's always room
for one more

03:47.728 --> 03:49.629
in the spiritual tub.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.832
See, I am down for that.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.468
But I'm not getting my head wet.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.405
This is over $300's worth
of somebody else's hair.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.975
Okay. I guess nobody cares
about the fire marshal.

04:03.075 --> 04:06.747
Okay. This looks
like so much fun, ladies.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.981
You know, I used
to play drums in church.

04:09.081 --> 04:11.050
(high-pitched clanging)

04:13.420 --> 04:16.423
All my childhood trauma's
coming back!

04:16.557 --> 04:18.158
Okay, Tina,
Tina, Tina?

04:18.257 --> 04:19.860
Tina.
What?

04:19.992 --> 04:21.862
These are sacred bowls.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.764
We play them
to clear our chakras.

04:23.896 --> 04:26.098
Chakras.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.235
Okay. (laughs)

04:29.370 --> 04:32.673
(mumbles)
The idea is
to make them sing.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.074
Here. Let me show you.

04:34.206 --> 04:37.110
Oh, girl, nobody needs
to show me how to sing.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.380
Well, then, join me.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.550
(plays tone)

04:42.682 --> 04:45.018
(harmonizing):
* Ah... *

04:45.117 --> 04:49.523
(tone plays)
* Ah... *

04:49.622 --> 04:51.091
(continues singing)

04:51.223 --> 04:55.095
* Chakra,
clearing my Chakra Khan. *

04:56.629 --> 04:58.899
* I'm ev...

04:59.031 --> 05:02.101
...ery goddess. (laughs)

05:02.235 --> 05:04.971
* It's all in me *

05:05.105 --> 05:07.475
* I can read
your thoughts right now *

05:07.608 --> 05:10.877
* Every one from A to Z... *

05:12.045 --> 05:13.781
This is fun.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.586
You know,

05:18.718 --> 05:21.754
nothing makes me happier
than living with my parents.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.290
(laughs)

05:23.423 --> 05:25.292
Uh, yup.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.293
That earthquake was a blessing
in disguise.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.298
They're not here, ass-kisser.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.233
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to stay in the will.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.670
Okay, check out this picture
of me and Necie.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.771
We recreated
he Lady and the Tramp.T

05:40.841 --> 05:42.843
God, you two are so corny.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.178
I know. I know.
We're perfect together.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.180
You know, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

05:48.314 --> 05:50.250
but I think I may
have found the one.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.019
Wait a minute. Marty, you-you
posted this on Instagram?

05:53.153 --> 05:55.788
Yeah, man.
You know, posting
a romantic photo

05:55.923 --> 05:58.425
after only a month is
relationship suicide.

05:58.526 --> 06:02.161
What?
Yeah, you know, you got to
start with a soft launch.

06:03.630 --> 06:07.935
Look, first start with a
close-up of both of your hands.

06:09.502 --> 06:12.673
Huh? And then,
you creep on up,

06:12.805 --> 06:15.208
yeah, to the elbows.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.377
Elbows?
Yeah.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.045
I'm trying
to show the world my girl,

06:19.178 --> 06:20.480
not do a lotion commercial.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.048
All right,

06:22.182 --> 06:23.651
but if you make
your relationship official

06:23.783 --> 06:25.052
before she's ready,

06:25.185 --> 06:27.187
lotion gonna be
all you got left.

06:28.855 --> 06:32.024
You know what? What do you know,
Single Person? Okay?

06:32.158 --> 06:34.694
We hashtag "Black love"
over here.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.865
Hey, where did our picture go?

06:37.997 --> 06:42.702
Oh, crap! Necie untagged herself
from my post.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.672
See, man? You
scared her off.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.473
No, but we call
each other "boo."

06:47.475 --> 06:50.043
The parking lady
at work calls me "boo."

06:50.177 --> 06:52.680
(phone ringing)
Oh, it's Necie.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.915
I'm about to be dumped.
Wait, wait, Marty, Marty.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.550
Don't answer it.

06:56.683 --> 07:00.086
She can't break up with you
if she can't reach you.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.422
(laughing)

07:02.555 --> 07:05.057
That is terrible advice!

07:05.192 --> 07:06.560
But I am gonna take it

07:06.694 --> 07:07.995
until I can come up
with something better.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.333
I mean, how crazy was that?

07:13.432 --> 07:16.036
I thought the singing bowls and
the crystal rubbing was kooky,

07:16.168 --> 07:18.572
but that, uh, Reiki massage?

07:18.706 --> 07:21.709
I mean, thank God
I didn't pay for it.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.209
You know,
she never laid a hand on me.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.245
(scoffs)

07:25.377 --> 07:27.615
Tina, this isn't a joke to me.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.281
Oh, come on, Gemma.

07:29.415 --> 07:31.785
You didn't think
that was weird?

07:31.918 --> 07:34.622
No. I believe
in energy healing.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.456
Ha! Since when?

07:36.590 --> 07:38.191
I mean, come on, Gemma.

07:38.290 --> 07:41.060
We used to make fun
of the hippie-dippie Cali girls

07:41.194 --> 07:43.630
flirting with trees
and howling at the moon.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.365
I mean, come on. (laughs)

07:46.466 --> 07:48.235
It's more than that.

07:48.367 --> 07:52.271
It's about tapping into the
feminine collective and healing.

07:52.404 --> 07:55.608
Are you sure
this is sage you're burning?

07:57.043 --> 08:00.648
No offense, Tina, but this is
why I didn't invite you.

08:00.781 --> 08:04.384
You have a tendency
to be a teeny, tiny bit

08:04.483 --> 08:06.819
obnoxiously judgmental.

08:07.821 --> 08:12.492
Well, I think "the collective"
tapped you in your head.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.764
'Cause you're falling
for some New Age baloney.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.298
(Gemma laughs)

08:18.430 --> 08:19.932
It is not baloney.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.468
And, you know, Aria was wrong.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.269
Your aura isn't beautiful!

08:23.403 --> 08:24.737
It's just okay!

08:28.408 --> 08:31.778
Yeah. Here you go, Mr. Thief.

08:31.911 --> 08:35.248
Ooh, please try
to steal from me tonight.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.250
'Cause when I catch your ass,

08:37.350 --> 08:39.485
you won't have fingers to steal,

08:39.620 --> 08:42.956
legs to run,
or a mouth to beg for mercy!

08:43.090 --> 08:46.293
That's right. We're gonna make
him go directly to jail.
Yes.

08:46.426 --> 08:50.363
Lock him in the pokey,
send him to the big house!

08:50.496 --> 08:52.799
Whatever it takes
to scare him straight.

08:52.932 --> 08:56.102
'Cause there's one thing I can't
stand, Dave-- that's a thief.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.370
Especially one that tries
to steal from me.

08:58.504 --> 08:59.840
Come on!

08:59.972 --> 09:02.542
This is exciting.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.510
It's like a real-life stakeout.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.980
I feel like Will Smith
from Bad Boys.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.149
Dave,

09:09.282 --> 09:11.684
if anybody is Will, it's me.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.821
I'm at least two inches
taller than you,

09:13.953 --> 09:15.989
and America loves me.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.025
(metallic clinking nearby)

09:19.158 --> 09:20.961
You hear that?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.495
(clinking continues)
It's the thief!

09:23.630 --> 09:25.899
They've come back
for the parts. Go, Dave!

09:26.033 --> 09:27.399
Stop!

09:27.533 --> 09:30.503
CALVIN:
I'm getting too old for this!

09:35.575 --> 09:37.309
They're out here somewhere.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.047
There he is. Get him!
I got you, you...

09:40.179 --> 09:41.181
Where are you going?
No, no, no.

09:41.313 --> 09:42.414
Come here, you dirty rascal.

09:42.548 --> 09:43.884
Look here.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.186
I hope you like your toilets
in your bedroom.

09:46.318 --> 09:49.322
Yeah. You're done, bro.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.857
Yeah.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.494
Uh... Lady bro?

09:55.995 --> 09:58.197
Ms. Bro? I...

09:58.331 --> 10:00.567
Look, I'm sorry. Uh,
what are your pronouns?

10:00.701 --> 10:03.703
She, her. I'm a girl.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.706
Which probably explains
why I make less as a thief.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.909
You're-you're just a kid.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.845
What are you doing
stealing car parts?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.113
Because Enrique needs them.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.014
Yeah, there it is.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.583
Always some dude.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.953
Yeah, you know,
steal for yourself, young lady.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.123
You're better than that.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.525
Enrique is my car.
I'm restoring him.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.062
That's a '63 Impala.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.965
Looks pretty good. There's
no way you fixed this car up.

10:32.099 --> 10:35.302
Esta chica puede arreglar
un carro mejor que tú.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.870
What'd you say to me?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.807
She said, she can fix a car
better than you.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.479
What? I am quasi-fluent
in all the romance languages.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.315
Yeah.

10:48.447 --> 10:50.317
Yeah, whatever.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.286
Just because you put a cotton
candy air freshener in there

10:53.419 --> 10:55.422
doesn't make you
a certified mechanic.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.456
You know what does?

10:57.590 --> 11:00.760
Dropping in
a 427-cubic-inch V-8 engine in.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.263
And I changed the exhaust
to Flowmasters.

11:03.395 --> 11:06.432
Oh, my baby Enrique is loud.
Oh.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.336
She really does know her stuff.
Sorry. Excuse me.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.072
My car right now
is making the weirdest noise.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.472
Hmm. Okay.
It just goes, "Urgh."

11:13.605 --> 11:15.808
(siren chirps)

11:15.942 --> 11:18.077
Okay, please. I'll give you
your stuff back.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.748
Oh, so now you want
to humble yourself

11:20.847 --> 11:22.149
now that you got caught?

11:22.282 --> 11:25.152
Big surprise.
It's you, Yoli.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.254
Let me guess.
Car parts?

11:27.354 --> 11:30.957
Yeah. So what are you gonna do?
Call her parents?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.259
Make her clean up trash
on the side of the freeway

11:33.360 --> 11:36.196
in one of those really
unflattering orange vests?

11:36.328 --> 11:38.597
No. I'm arresting her.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.433
But I-I can't do this to my...
I told you the last time,

11:41.533 --> 11:43.135
no more warnings.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.672
I need you guys to meet
us down at the station.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.674
Come on, man. I can't
go to jail. Please?

11:48.808 --> 11:50.677
Okay, Officer, look.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.644
I'm not gonna press charges.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.148
Really? Are you sure, sir?

11:55.282 --> 11:57.517
Yeah, I don't think

11:57.649 --> 12:00.386
putting her in the system
is gonna solve the problem.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.554
All right.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.558
Free to go.

12:06.692 --> 12:09.028
Don't make him
wrong, Yoli.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.634
Thanks.
That was really cool of you.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.471
Look, you're a kid,

12:18.571 --> 12:20.506
and you made
some bad decisions.

12:20.639 --> 12:23.676
I'm giving you an opportunity
for a second chance.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.345
Thanks.

12:25.477 --> 12:26.879
Deuces.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.581
Hey, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no.

12:29.716 --> 12:33.352
No, this second chance comes
with two conditions.

12:33.485 --> 12:36.588
One-- you work for me,

12:36.722 --> 12:39.927
and two-- you work for me.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.195
(laughs softly)
I don't think so.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.331
Oh, really? Dave, why don't you
call the cops back?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.665
DAVE: Yup.
Okay, okay. You win.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.235
All right,
I'll expect to see you

12:49.369 --> 12:51.104
at my shop tomorrow.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.273
And this time,
you're invited.

12:54.506 --> 12:56.709
And make sure
you're on time.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.378
Deuces.

12:59.846 --> 13:03.082
Ooh, ooh, have to
grab my car parts. Come on.
Oh, you...

13:06.753 --> 13:10.256
Oh! The renovations are
starting to come together.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.926
Marty, the kitchen sink is
in the living room.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.761
Yeah, and at this rate,

13:15.895 --> 13:17.730
we're gonna be at your house
another two months.

13:17.865 --> 13:21.533
What? Mama,
that is 1,460 hours. Uh...

13:23.403 --> 13:26.072
Not that I was counting. Yeah.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.707
Ooh. Oh.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.309
No!

13:30.442 --> 13:32.812
Necie's out there,
and she's headed to our house.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.315
She's trying to
break up with me.

13:35.447 --> 13:39.385
No. No, no, no.
No. No breakup.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.288
You like this girl,
and more importantly,

13:42.422 --> 13:45.557
I like this girl.
Let me talk to her.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.659
Mom, no. I can
handle this on my own.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.461
I'm not a kid.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.665
But if I do get dumped, can
you have your shoulders ready,

13:53.799 --> 13:56.302
and can you please make
my favorite hot chocolate?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.404
Oh. I got you, baby.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.174
Mommy'll whip you up a batch
from the... living room sink.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.947
Hey. Oh!

14:08.081 --> 14:10.750
Hey! You almost
got me. (laughs)

14:10.850 --> 14:12.418
You would've
deserved it.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.087
Marty, why are you ghosting me?

14:15.187 --> 14:17.157
If you're gonna break up with
me, at least do it to my face.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.625
What? I thought
you wanted to break up with me

14:19.759 --> 14:21.995
because you untagged yourself
from our picture on Instagram.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.996
Oh.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.000
I untagged the picture
from my professional account.

14:27.134 --> 14:30.136
I can't be slurping spaghetti
on my boxing page.

14:30.269 --> 14:33.840
Unlike you, cute
is not my brand.

14:33.974 --> 14:37.376
Y-You're right. I am cute.
(laughs)

14:37.509 --> 14:40.947
You know, you have no
reason to feel insecure.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.950
You got me, boo.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.652
And guess what, boo?
You got me, too.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.056
(quietly):
Yes.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.856
No.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.028
(knocking)

14:55.162 --> 14:57.297
Knock, knock.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.701
Oh, if it isn't the Jolly Green
Goddess of Evergreen Drive.

15:04.303 --> 15:06.739
Well, usually I travel
by astral plane,

15:06.873 --> 15:08.975
but I decided to walk over.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.546
Tina, I am really sorry
about this mess.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.515
I should have told you
I was exploring mysticism.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.850
Why did you keep it
such a big secret?

15:18.985 --> 15:21.721
I knew you'd think
all this stuff was silly,

15:21.854 --> 15:23.755
but after my miscarriage,

15:23.889 --> 15:27.594
I was searching for a way
to work through my pain.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.996
Nothing worked
until I met Aria.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.532
That goddess group
really helped me heal.

15:32.664 --> 15:34.767
Wow, Gemma. I had no idea.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.269
And I'm glad you found
the healing you needed.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.407
And I'm sorry.
I-I would never mock anything

15:40.539 --> 15:42.408
that's important to you...

15:42.542 --> 15:43.909
except maybe your husband.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.611
(laughs)

15:45.745 --> 15:47.746
Yeah, well,
we all do that.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.284
But just for the record,

15:52.418 --> 15:56.288
you are a big source
of positive energy in my life.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.290
That's mutual.
(laughs softly)

15:58.424 --> 16:00.726
And you know you can talk to me
about anything, right?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.861
I do.

16:02.961 --> 16:05.697
All right. Well, now
that you're a goddess...

16:05.798 --> 16:07.700
(Gemma laughs)

16:07.799 --> 16:10.937
...can you invoke anything to
speed up my damn renovations?

16:11.071 --> 16:13.472
Hey, I am just stepping
into my feminine power.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.642
I can't work miracles yet.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.446
But I can make
a bottle of wine appear.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.114
What?
Ta-da!

16:21.248 --> 16:23.582
Ooh!

16:23.716 --> 16:26.985
Amen! I mean, A-woman.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.327
Thanks

16:35.461 --> 16:37.230
for not pressing charges.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.965
I brought back everything.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.932
Even the things
you didn't notice I stole.

16:41.933 --> 16:44.003
Whoa. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:44.136 --> 16:47.774
No. The deal we made is
that you work for me.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.408
That's part of
the bargain.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.411
Oh.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.613
You were serious about that?

16:53.745 --> 16:57.417
Yes. Now I may not
call the cops,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.485
but somebody in this
neighborhood knows your parents,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.187
and I will call them.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.190
(scoffs)
Good luck.

17:03.322 --> 17:06.125
My papi got deported when I was
12, and my mom works doubles.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.694
So, I take care of myself.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.696
That's tough.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.531
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.634
It is what it is.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.636
Enrique was actually
my dad's car.

17:17.769 --> 17:19.638
We were working on him together,

17:19.771 --> 17:21.807
and I was trying
to finish him for when...

17:21.941 --> 17:24.009
if he gets back
into the country.

17:24.144 --> 17:28.315
Well, he did a good
job teaching you.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.782
You just need to use
your talents in a way

17:30.883 --> 17:33.185
that keeps you off
my security cameras.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.488
Where are those cameras?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.190
You don't need
to worry about that.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.491
You're right.

17:39.625 --> 17:43.130
Hey, have you ever installed
a throttle shifter?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.664
No.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.067
But I did try to steal one once.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.037
Well, don't try
to steal one twice.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.805
I'm nice, not stupid.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.075
Here. Watch and learn.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.913
Well, I got to say,
your '63 Impala is nice,

18:01.047 --> 18:03.583
but it's not
factory original.

18:03.715 --> 18:07.086
The '63s came with chrome
mirrors and not stainless steel.

18:07.220 --> 18:11.490
Sorry, viejo, but '63s
definitely came with stainless.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.160
Oh, really?

18:13.259 --> 18:16.061
If only there was a way we could
figure out who was right.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.365
Okay.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.200
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.834
Yeah, here it is right here.

18:21.933 --> 18:27.574
1963 Impala-- chrome...
and stainless steel mirrors.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.175
So I was right.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.611
And I was also
right, right?

18:31.743 --> 18:34.447
Yeah, but I was more right
because chrome was first.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.250
Oh. (laughs)

18:37.384 --> 18:39.852
All right, well, we've done
enough for today, all right?

18:39.951 --> 18:41.119
You can get on out of here.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.922
Uh, I saw a Buick
in the back.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.523
Do you need any
help with that?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.526
Sure. Why don't you
call your mom

18:46.625 --> 18:48.260
and let her know
you're gonna be late.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.730
I'll text her.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.435
(laughter)

18:56.568 --> 18:59.205
(laughs)
I don't know what she said,

18:59.306 --> 19:00.906
but I'm gonna take it
as a compliment.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.308
(laughs)

19:02.442 --> 19:04.644
Hey, hey,
get back to work.

19:10.282 --> 19:17.056
* Whoa, my love

19:17.155 --> 19:19.925
* My darling... *

19:20.058 --> 19:21.760
Okay, now only three
of our followers

19:21.894 --> 19:23.430
are gonna get
this Ghost reference,

19:23.563 --> 19:25.897
but those three people
are gonna really like it.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.403
The only follower
I care about is you.

19:30.502 --> 19:34.307
* Lonely time... *

19:34.441 --> 19:35.775
More clay?

19:35.907 --> 19:38.144
As much as you've got.
Mm.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.518
What the hell

19:45.652 --> 19:48.488
kind of freaky
mating ritual was that?

19:49.788 --> 19:52.759
I got to tell Tina.

19:52.858 --> 19:57.763
* This is the dawning
of the age of Aquarius *

19:57.864 --> 20:02.602
* Age of Aquarius... *

20:02.701 --> 20:06.172
What in the hell kind
of freaky female ritual is this?

20:06.306 --> 20:08.340
I got to tell Dave.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.876
* Aquarius... *
