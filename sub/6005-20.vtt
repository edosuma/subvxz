- I wish he was at his peak...
- Ryan. Fuck you.

38:02.177 --> 38:03.778
- Fuck you.
- (CHUCKLES)

38:03.779 --> 38:04.679
Stop.

38:04.713 --> 38:06.313
You're not gonna shit
on this fucking win.

38:06.314 --> 38:07.381
You understand me?

38:07.382 --> 38:09.249
You won the fight, he fucking lost.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.250
Who do you want to be?

38:10.318 --> 38:12.853
Who do you want to be?

38:12.854 --> 38:13.788
Me.

38:13.789 --> 38:14.989
You.

38:14.990 --> 38:16.724
(CHUCKLING) Neurotic motherfucker.

38:16.725 --> 38:17.925
Come on, man.

38:17.926 --> 38:18.993
(CHUCKLING) All right.

38:18.994 --> 38:20.862
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

38:20.996 --> 38:21.796
Alvey. Yeah?

38:21.930 --> 38:24.198
Kenny's ready for you. Okay, I'm coming.

38:24.199 --> 38:25.800
Listen, I'll see you in a couple days.

38:25.934 --> 38:27.001
Enjoy the fucking win.

38:27.002 --> 38:28.068
All right.

38:28.069 --> 38:30.739
Good boy. Thanks, coach.

38:32.073 --> 38:33.941
Hey.

38:33.942 --> 38:35.944
Hey.

38:40.081 --> 38:43.018
Oh, why, thank you.

38:43.952 --> 38:45.953
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:45.954 --> 38:48.088
Congratulations.

38:48.089 --> 38:50.357
Thanks.

38:50.358 --> 38:53.160
You looked great out there.

38:53.161 --> 38:56.363
Thanks.

38:56.364 --> 38:57.966
I hope Jay's all right.

38:58.099 --> 39:00.101
I know.

39:00.235 --> 39:02.637
Yeah.

39:09.978 --> 39:12.112
Okay, so I should go.

39:12.113 --> 39:13.313
(CHUCKLES)

39:13.314 --> 39:15.984
What are you doing tonight?
What are you doing?

39:17.375 --> 39:19.510
Nothing.

39:19.988 --> 39:21.990
You want to do something?

39:23.458 --> 39:28.530
It's either you, or I'm going
home to stare at a wall.

39:31.866 --> 39:33.868
Thank you.

39:50.351 --> 39:51.351
Nate, could I talk to you a minute?

39:51.352 --> 39:54.021
Go to Jay's motel, get his clothes.

39:54.022 --> 39:56.691
Bring them home.

40:10.972 --> 40:14.709
It is not as bad as it looks.

40:14.843 --> 40:17.645
I'm okay.

40:19.781 --> 40:21.783
Really.

40:50.078 --> 40:53.547
"Dear Jay.

40:53.548 --> 40:58.485
I know that I've been a
disappointment to you.

40:58.486 --> 41:04.091
I know that you feel
that I never wanted you.

41:04.092 --> 41:06.360
I see the things that you do

41:06.361 --> 41:09.563
and the ways that you hurt yourself,

41:09.564 --> 41:14.235
and I know it's because
of the choices I've made.

41:14.369 --> 41:17.437
And even when you had the courage

41:17.438 --> 41:23.177
to beg me to stop using
and just stay home,

41:23.178 --> 41:26.380
I still didn't choose you...

41:26.381 --> 41:31.051
because I didn't care if I was alive.

41:31.052 --> 41:33.721
I wanted to die."

41:35.190 --> 41:39.459
"For a child to feel that
they are not reason enough

41:39.460 --> 41:43.865
for their mother to
live is beyond cruel."

41:47.335 --> 41:51.205
"I don't expect you to forgive me

41:51.206 --> 41:55.075
or even accept my apology.

41:55.076 --> 41:58.279
But I am so deeply sorry

41:58.413 --> 42:02.015
for the pain I have put you through,

42:02.016 --> 42:06.153
for the innocence I cost you,

42:06.154 --> 42:10.558
and for not truly being your mother."

42:14.162 --> 42:18.966
"I can never love you
enough to make up for it,

42:18.967 --> 42:21.903
but I'm gonna try."

42:42.056 --> 42:44.592
But...

42:46.060 --> 42:48.061
...last couple months, like,

42:48.062 --> 42:52.199
there was no quality
of life at all, so...

42:52.200 --> 42:55.536
And my dad sure as shit
wasn't going in a home.

42:55.670 --> 42:59.941
(CHUCKLES) So, now I
guess it was a blessing.

43:00.074 --> 43:02.076
Just...

43:05.013 --> 43:07.548
But I really do think

43:07.682 --> 43:11.018
that God gives people as
much as they can handle.

43:11.019 --> 43:13.021
Fuck.

43:16.090 --> 43:18.760
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

43:23.164 --> 43:26.100
Are you a God person now?

43:26.234 --> 43:30.103
I took his bible. I've
been kind of reading it.

43:30.104 --> 43:32.106
Not like my dad was some big Christian.

43:32.107 --> 43:33.007
I didn't think so.

43:33.041 --> 43:35.576
(CHUCKLES)

43:38.513 --> 43:42.115
I wish I could've said goodbye.

43:42.116 --> 43:43.718
I told him for you.

43:43.851 --> 43:44.918
Mm.

43:44.919 --> 43:46.921
Really? Mm-hmm.

43:47.989 --> 43:50.925
He was like... "Who?"

43:51.059 --> 43:54.128
(BOTH LAUGH)

43:54.262 --> 43:56.129
He was such a dick.

43:56.130 --> 43:58.666
(CHUCKLES)

44:02.003 --> 44:05.205
You seem really good.

44:05.206 --> 44:07.207
I am now.

44:07.208 --> 44:10.144
Finally.

44:10.278 --> 44:12.947
It took a while.

45:30.491 --> 45:34.362
My dad went on a full
mental-health offensive.

45:34.495 --> 45:39.167
Therapists and psychiatrists
and grief people.

45:39.300 --> 45:41.034
(SIGHS)

45:41.035 --> 45:44.104
Full suicide watch.

45:44.105 --> 45:47.842
He was not gonna let
me be alone in a room.

45:49.043 --> 45:51.845
Were you thinking about it?

45:51.846 --> 45:52.913
Killing myself?

45:52.914 --> 45:54.782
Mm-hmm.

46:01.055 --> 46:03.724
No.

46:05.460 --> 46:10.798
But I do fantasize about
being dead with my son.

46:14.001 --> 46:16.938
I don't know why this happened to you.

46:21.342 --> 46:23.877
Sometimes I think I caused it.

46:23.878 --> 46:24.946
That's not fucking true.

46:25.079 --> 46:27.080
No, it is.

46:27.081 --> 46:29.483
I didn't want him.

46:29.484 --> 46:34.287
I thought he was someone
that Alvey stuck me with,

46:34.288 --> 46:37.625
and he was gonna ruin my life.

46:40.161 --> 46:43.097
I swear to God he felt that.

46:43.231 --> 46:46.834
I know he did.

46:46.968 --> 46:49.770
And it kills me.

46:56.310 --> 46:59.914
But then when we got to San
Francisco, that all changed.

46:59.915 --> 47:01.215
It's just...

47:01.249 --> 47:06.187
It was just him and me, and...

47:06.320 --> 47:09.657
I fell so in love.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.261
I thought about our whole life,

47:13.394 --> 47:19.132
and the way that he would look at me...

47:19.133 --> 47:21.669
Lisa.

47:25.940 --> 47:27.140
I know.

47:27.141 --> 47:29.944
It just is.

47:42.890 --> 47:45.158
JAY: Hey.

47:45.159 --> 47:48.095
<i>Buenos noches.</i>

48:14.789 --> 48:17.858
Well...

48:19.727 --> 48:21.862
Now you know.

48:25.866 --> 48:28.536
Why didn't you tell me?

48:30.404 --> 48:34.675
I really don't want anyone to know.

48:35.209 --> 48:39.079
At the gym, or, you know...

48:39.080 --> 48:40.814
Especially not dad.

48:40.815 --> 48:42.550
That's...

48:44.018 --> 48:46.821
You know.

48:46.954 --> 48:49.356
You don't...

48:49.357 --> 48:52.959
You don't think he'll be cool with it?

48:52.960 --> 48:55.896
(LAUGHS)

48:58.032 --> 49:00.835
(COUGHING)

49:05.773 --> 49:08.174
Nate.

49:08.175 --> 49:10.311
It's your life.

49:10.444 --> 49:12.847
It's not for me to say anything.

49:18.185 --> 49:21.254
Are you mad?

49:21.255 --> 49:22.856
That you're gay?

49:22.857 --> 49:25.125
No.

49:25.126 --> 49:27.662
That I didn't tell you.

49:30.064 --> 49:33.668
I'm sorry that you felt
like you couldn't.

49:36.070 --> 49:38.204
Yeah.

49:38.205 --> 49:40.340
But listen to me when I tell you

49:40.341 --> 49:43.811
that nothing changes between us.

49:45.012 --> 49:47.947
I swear to God.

49:47.948 --> 49:49.016
Yeah.

49:52.219 --> 49:56.356
Except... you better be on top,

49:56.357 --> 49:59.293
because you're my brother
and you do the fucking.

49:59.427 --> 50:01.428
You look me in the eyes when I
talk to you right now, son.

50:01.429 --> 50:04.230
You understand what I'm saying?

50:04.231 --> 50:06.100
Look at me when I tell you this.

50:06.233 --> 50:09.036
You better be doing the fucking.

50:09.170 --> 50:11.304
Nathaniel, you're my brother,

50:11.305 --> 50:14.107
and there's a certain line
that needs to be towed.

50:14.108 --> 50:15.176
Are you done?

50:15.309 --> 50:17.177
No, sir. I'm not. I
always knew you were gay.

50:17.178 --> 50:19.046
You got a lot of gay qualities.

50:19.180 --> 50:20.420
I don't have any gay qualities.

50:20.514 --> 50:23.183
You're very gentle. You
smell delightful, you know?

50:23.184 --> 50:24.517
(SNIFFS) Yeah, you dress well.

50:24.518 --> 50:28.254
But if you turn our house into
a Palm Springs pool fiesta,

50:28.255 --> 50:31.324
I'll tell you, I'm moving out.

50:31.325 --> 50:33.994
I love you, dude.

50:39.066 --> 50:41.869
Love you.

50:44.805 --> 50:46.139
Go to bed.

50:46.140 --> 50:47.875
Just go to bed.

50:48.008 --> 50:49.476
(LAUGHS)

50:49.477 --> 50:52.680
- You'll make a real nice nurse someday.
- Okay.

50:52.681 --> 50:55.883
- Make a nice man very lucky.
- Okay.
