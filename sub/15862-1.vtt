00:24.490 --> 00:25.957
You knew my dad, right?

00:26.125 --> 00:29.492
He wasn't senile.
More of a bossy go-getter.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.990
Then he started to bug me, bigtime.

00:33.299 --> 00:36.894
He bugged me as a whole,
but this was new.

00:37.637 --> 00:41.630
Before, he'd only pretend to consult me.
He'd say 'Do this'

00:41.841 --> 00:43.138
and l'd do it.

00:43.309 --> 00:46.301
Now he starts asking
my advice on everything,

00:46.479 --> 00:48.242
what l'd do if l were him...

00:48.381 --> 00:52.078
even what l think of him
balling his female staff!

00:52.252 --> 00:54.743
l hated it. lt grossed me out.

00:56.055 --> 01:00.515
He went on like we were buddies.
lt drove me nuts!

01:06.466 --> 01:09.264
Then it clicked.
This wasn't my dad, here.

01:09.435 --> 01:13.030
He'd become like a kid
that l was responsible for.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.834
Like l was the dad, see?

01:20.947 --> 01:21.971
See what happens?

01:22.148 --> 01:25.743
You wake up one morning
and things have switched places.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.013
Gimme a light.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.222
The bitch of it is, you're helpless.

01:33.393 --> 01:37.022
You can scream and kick
the walls, it's no goddamn use.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.432
Time's moved on,
your dad's an old man,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.534
you're not immortal anymore.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.533
Do you believe in God?

01:45.171 --> 01:48.231
Times like that
make you start to believe.

01:52.845 --> 01:55.609
Finally, you learn to put up with it.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.450
Then my dad fell sick and l...

01:59.619 --> 02:02.213
l nursed him like a baby.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.716
Wiped his ass, fed him,
cleaned his mouth...

02:12.999 --> 02:16.332
The worst thing was,
l didn't want it to stop.

02:16.502 --> 02:19.733
The year after that,
l had my first kid.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.685
THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKlPPED

03:12.191 --> 03:13.351
l don't see why.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.294
l really don't see why.

03:16.829 --> 03:19.024
l told you about a house
on Rue Carrel.

03:19.198 --> 03:22.497
On the east side.
You didn't mention the west side.

03:22.835 --> 03:26.134
Whichever side,
you knew it was my patch!

03:26.272 --> 03:27.967
Why not the whole region?

03:28.207 --> 03:31.665
You pulled a fast one on me,
admit it.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.870
Can't you kill the sound
and your cigar?

03:35.081 --> 03:36.844
- How much d'you want?
- Dunno.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.142
Don't know?

03:39.652 --> 03:40.277
50-50?

03:40.553 --> 03:44.216
50-50? l set up the deal
and you take half for nothing?

03:44.524 --> 03:45.513
Hot stuff!

03:45.691 --> 03:48.159
Hang on!
l can bring know-how and cash.

03:48.761 --> 03:52.253
Sure! Take a lot of know-how
to make me swallow that.

03:54.634 --> 03:55.601
What's your offer?

03:55.935 --> 03:57.766
Nothing. Nada!

03:57.970 --> 04:00.700
You're the one sweating it.
l don't need you.

04:01.707 --> 04:02.901
That's a new one!

04:03.042 --> 04:04.134
Hear that, Sami?

04:04.310 --> 04:07.211
l don't give a shit.
Do your business.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.644
Do your deal
and stop crapping about it.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.915
l'll give you 'l don't need you.'

04:14.520 --> 04:17.750
ln the last six months...
Who found the warehouses?

04:17.990 --> 04:21.221
Without me, you'd still be
haggling with that old bag.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.186
- And the tennis courts...
- Tennis courts?

04:26.365 --> 04:28.390
The acre along the highway.

04:28.634 --> 04:32.195
lf you don't remember that,
what you need is a doctor!

04:34.941 --> 04:36.374
So what's your offer?

04:36.542 --> 04:38.567
l told you, 50-50.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.170
OK, plus half of the Belgrand deal.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.281
Like fuck!
Belgrand's worth four times Massy!

04:44.450 --> 04:45.940
Don't give me that!

04:46.085 --> 04:49.248
lf Massy's worth shit,
why make such a big deal of it?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.849
- This it?
- On the left.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.299
Cut it out!

05:14.914 --> 05:16.142
You go that way.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.410
Two floors up.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.818
l can't see!
Gimme a flashlight. You have a spare.

06:09.201 --> 06:10.498
What's going on up there?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.864
Search me. A rat must've bit him.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.706
The asshole scared me!

06:22.348 --> 06:24.873
- What's up, Sami?
- lt ran up my leg and bit me!

06:25.051 --> 06:26.450
Where? Let me see.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.053
- Fuckin' bit me all over!
- l can't see.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.450
- What do you want?
- My smokes.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.756
OK, fuck you.

06:34.594 --> 06:35.891
Fuck you!

06:42.702 --> 06:44.863
l've thought it over. lt's a deal.

06:46.138 --> 06:48.606
- What's a deal?
- What we said.

06:49.141 --> 06:51.905
Massy and the Belgrand place, 50-50.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.813
- When's the due date?
- 22nd.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.614
- How much under the table?
- 500,000.

07:00.252 --> 07:02.550
250,000 each. OK with you?

07:06.292 --> 07:08.487
One thing l don't get about Beefy.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.290
lf he hates rats,
why does he plant them?

07:11.430 --> 07:14.194
- Why not plant something else?
- What, snakes?

07:14.400 --> 07:15.731
Or his mother?

07:17.169 --> 07:18.534
- Feeling better?
- And you?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.326
Go away!

08:27.039 --> 08:28.006
When will you be done?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.507
This part tonight.
The rest in two days, minimum.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.107
Thursday?

08:33.578 --> 08:37.174
l'm signing the deal at 11 AM.
Get me the plans by 8.

08:37.349 --> 08:39.510
- l can't.
- Course you can!

08:41.821 --> 08:44.847
What's the rush?
We can beat him down.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.926
He owes Martens 60,000.
l'll tell Martens to collect.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.392
Why would he?

08:50.529 --> 08:53.259
l know him. He owes me one.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.857
lf he finds out,
we'll find ourselves buying from him.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.061
Don't be paranoid. He won't know.

09:03.175 --> 09:06.770
You handle Martens,
l'll fix the lawyer and City Hall.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.020
You can't go in there!
You're trespassing!

09:20.459 --> 09:21.892
They broke the lock!

09:22.027 --> 09:24.495
You're trespassing on private property!

09:24.630 --> 09:26.928
Where are you going? Get out!

09:27.166 --> 09:29.566
- What's your problem?
- l own this place!

09:29.769 --> 09:30.497
Clear out.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.763
- You're crazy!
- No, l'm the owner.

09:33.572 --> 09:36.302
- No entry!
- l live here.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.205
No! No, you don't.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.344
Where were you?

09:41.547 --> 09:43.139
Stuck in traffic. l came quick...

09:43.315 --> 09:45.215
Can't you ever do what you say?

09:45.384 --> 09:46.578
l was stuck in traffic!

09:46.752 --> 09:49.812
Bullshit! The watchman says
you never came here once.

09:50.122 --> 09:52.022
And now look!

09:52.291 --> 09:53.349
Get this zoo out of here!

09:54.226 --> 09:56.558
- Who are you?
- Leave them alone.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.490
Who are you?

09:57.630 --> 09:59.825
Housing Rights group.
You the owners?

09:59.999 --> 10:01.125
Guess!

10:01.267 --> 10:02.461
This is illegal.

10:02.968 --> 10:04.128
The law's on our side.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.328
They've been here 48 hours.

10:06.472 --> 10:08.804
There's water, power.
lt's their home now.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.772
You want your building back,

10:10.943 --> 10:12.774
find a place to rehouse them.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.378
We can get the cops.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.141
The cops are right there. Go get them!

10:20.486 --> 10:23.717
They're not squatters, they're families.
That's the point.

10:23.989 --> 10:27.550
They've only occupied the street side,
not the back yet.

10:27.726 --> 10:31.287
Get Lesrec and his guys here quick
or we're stuck for six months.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.578
How many apartments are there?

11:00.025 --> 11:01.356
Won't be so easy now!

11:01.493 --> 11:02.619
Halfass!

11:55.581 --> 11:56.513
Hi.

12:02.121 --> 12:02.985
Did you order?

12:04.290 --> 12:05.621
l was waiting for you.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.489
Boy, that looks... What is it?

12:09.929 --> 12:10.987
Electro.

12:12.097 --> 12:13.223
Try it?

12:23.809 --> 12:25.071
You dig this for real?

12:26.812 --> 12:27.801
Seriously?

12:28.914 --> 12:30.074
l listen to it!

12:33.185 --> 12:35.153
What's this shit called again?

12:44.096 --> 12:46.155
Why are you jumpy? Balls itch?

12:46.298 --> 12:47.697
You wanted to talk.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.029
What if l got married again?

12:56.942 --> 12:57.840
Do l know her?

12:58.243 --> 13:01.041
Not yet. l asked her
to come meet you.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.342
Wait till you see her.
A beaut!

13:04.516 --> 13:06.416
She's got tits...

13:07.019 --> 13:09.647
legs up to her chin...
and an ass!

13:11.790 --> 13:12.757
That should do.

13:12.925 --> 13:14.358
Am l making you awkward?

13:18.831 --> 13:20.423
Do you have to marry her?

13:20.799 --> 13:21.925
Have to?

13:22.067 --> 13:23.625
No, why?

13:26.672 --> 13:27.696
She's not pregnant.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.074
That's not what l meant.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.874
Tell me straight.
You say no, l won't.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.879
Do it, Dad.
lf that's what you want.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.744
lf it makes you happy, do it.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.612
Sure! Do it.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.018
One other thing.

13:43.188 --> 13:47.249
<i>There's a couscous joint
owes me six months' rent.</i>

13:47.426 --> 13:49.291
Every time l ask for it, he whines,

13:49.461 --> 13:52.453
'My wife's pregnant,
my daughter's getting married,' etc.

13:52.631 --> 13:56.431
Guess what? The rat's buying
tax-deductible real estate!

13:56.635 --> 14:01.368
He's fleecing me
and lining his nest with it!

14:01.507 --> 14:02.838
Can you fix him?

14:04.209 --> 14:07.110
- lt won't take you a minute.
- l said OK.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.849
l wrote it all down here.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.089
Here comes Gorgeous!

14:22.394 --> 14:23.952
My son Thomas, Chris.

14:26.698 --> 14:30.532
l have a call to make.
Sit there, l won't be long.

14:30.836 --> 14:34.067
<i>- Want a drink?
- A kir.</i>

14:34.206 --> 14:36.003
- You?
- l'm fine.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.947
So you're Robert's son?

14:51.623 --> 14:52.749
What do you do?

14:53.292 --> 14:55.624
l model, for catalogs.

14:56.028 --> 15:00.431
And commercials, if l can.
l auditioned for one this morning.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.401
Competition must be stiff.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.563
All those East European girls.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.864
Why East European?

15:09.508 --> 15:11.703
lt's just the way l heard it.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.045
You're in real estate, like Robert?

15:23.489 --> 15:25.252
- How's business?
- OK.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.122
So what's Chris short for?

15:31.497 --> 15:32.429
Yvonne?

15:33.799 --> 15:35.426
No, Christine.

15:37.703 --> 15:40.137
Are you getting at me?
Did l offend you?

15:40.305 --> 15:41.431
Why are you getting at me?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.007
Just kidding.
Are you serious about Robert?

15:45.410 --> 15:46.934
l think so.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.341
We haven't known each other long.

15:49.748 --> 15:52.740
We go out and have fun.
He makes me laugh.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.880
lntroduces me to people.

15:59.491 --> 16:00.651
l love my dad.

16:01.660 --> 16:05.152
l don't want him taken for a ride
and have to pick up the pieces.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.954
Did you order?

16:07.266 --> 16:08.255
l can't stay.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.338
Order, l'll be back.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.069
Why are you leaving?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.246
l forgot an appointment.

16:24.449 --> 16:25.780
How do you like her?

16:25.951 --> 16:27.350
You're the one marrying her.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.487
l know, but what do you think?

16:29.655 --> 16:30.747
Nothing.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.481
What's that mean?

16:32.958 --> 16:34.516
She's a whore, Dad.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.662
Why? Because she
models and stuff?

16:37.796 --> 16:39.286
Because she's a whore!

16:39.431 --> 16:41.023
You asked me, l answered.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.794
Hey, forget it.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.033
Forget it. Sorry l spoke.

18:04.683 --> 18:05.741
Mr. Fox!

18:10.889 --> 18:12.686
Could you ask that gentleman...

18:18.764 --> 18:21.164
Don't you recognize me?
Thomas Seyr.

18:22.567 --> 18:23.693
Sonia's son?

18:24.670 --> 18:25.466
Tom, right?

18:26.071 --> 18:28.471
- How old are you now?
- 28.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.432
You're here for the concert?

18:32.444 --> 18:35.572
- Did you hear him play at Pleyel?
- l missed it.

18:35.747 --> 18:38.944
You'll see he's very good.
l'm his manager.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.248
Have you kept it up?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.509
Music?

18:42.688 --> 18:44.781
Do you still play the piano?

18:44.923 --> 18:46.686
Yes... and no.

18:47.092 --> 18:50.084
lt got complicated after Mom died.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.994
That's a shame.
You had talent.

18:53.165 --> 18:56.032
l remember you
played something for me.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.794
A Haydn sonata, number 32.

19:00.706 --> 19:01.866
lt's starting.

19:02.074 --> 19:02.972
l'll be off.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.405
Here's my card.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.772
Come play piano for me.

19:06.978 --> 19:08.206
Come for an audition.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.281
Call my assistant and set a date.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.845
Don't let me down.

19:58.730 --> 19:59.788
<i>I can't focus.</i>

19:59.931 --> 20:00.920
<i>Try again?</i>

20:03.201 --> 20:05.669
<i>I'm too...
My heart's beating too hard.</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:15.513
<i>No good!</i>

20:19.017 --> 20:21.247
<i>I'm too nervous. I can't do it.</i>

20:37.636 --> 20:39.570
<i>- It's not perfect.
- Very cIose.</i>

20:41.039 --> 20:43.064
<i>CIose but not quite!</i>

20:46.111 --> 20:48.204
<i>It Iooks easy but...</i>

20:50.248 --> 20:51.613
<i>It's very cIean.</i>

20:52.184 --> 20:54.516
<i>But the emotion is not very generous.</i>

23:04.215 --> 23:05.477
Can l help you?

23:09.487 --> 23:12.217
- You last played when?
- About ten years ago.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.789
Ten years without practice?

23:13.925 --> 23:16.416
l practice.
l never gave up completely.

23:16.595 --> 23:20.793
l play for myself,
when l'm in the mood, or for friends.

23:21.032 --> 23:22.260
And now you're auditioning?

23:22.834 --> 23:24.096
That's right.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.637
You're too old for the conservatory.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.702
For a competition?

23:29.874 --> 23:31.842
For an agent. A manager.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.034
Manager?

23:33.211 --> 23:34.610
So he'll take me on.

23:34.779 --> 23:36.542
l'm confused.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.808
You're not a professional pianist?

23:39.517 --> 23:40.882
So why a manager?

23:45.290 --> 23:46.689
He offered to audition me.

23:46.858 --> 23:50.259
My mother was a concert pianist...
He managed her concerts.

23:50.428 --> 23:54.296
l grew up with music.
There was always a piano at home...

23:56.167 --> 23:56.997
l know about it.

23:57.636 --> 24:00.503
lf l'm good,
l think he'll take me on.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.434
As what? A pianist?

24:04.476 --> 24:05.670
A concert pianist?

24:11.650 --> 24:12.912
May l ask what you do?

24:14.653 --> 24:15.915
l work.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.383
ln what field?

24:17.522 --> 24:18.887
l work in real estate.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.456
l'm a broker, see?

24:21.860 --> 24:25.455
l plant rats in buildings,
cut off the water and power.

24:26.631 --> 24:29.532
Sometimes me and my pals
go in with baseball bats

24:29.701 --> 24:32.670
and force people out of their homes.

24:33.938 --> 24:35.428
What exactly do you want?

24:35.607 --> 24:37.575
Play me something, go on.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.537
- What are you doing?
- Fuck you, prick!

24:40.679 --> 24:42.203
What's the big idea?

24:46.151 --> 24:47.743
lt's an agency downtown.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.979
Call Madame Bouffera.
l spoke with her.

24:51.389 --> 24:56.156
06-22-68-90-12

25:00.031 --> 25:02.090
l told you about it. l'm not wacko.

25:02.267 --> 25:05.395
Tell her l sent you and call me back.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.172
What do you want?

25:12.343 --> 25:15.437
l heard you talking to our teacher.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.313
You want piano lessons?

25:17.482 --> 25:19.347
Just someone to judge my playing.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.649
l have a friend, a pianist.

25:22.887 --> 25:25.720
Her name is Miao Lin.
She just arrived in Paris.

25:25.890 --> 25:28.620
She studied at the Beijing Conservatory

25:28.793 --> 25:30.920
and won a two-year scholarship.

25:31.396 --> 25:35.059
She has given lessons and concerts.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.231
Are you interested?

25:37.936 --> 25:38.903
Depends.

25:39.070 --> 25:42.938
lf so, call this number
and ask for Jean-Pierre.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.737
- Who's Jean-Pierre?
- Me.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.653
What's this rathole?

26:01.826 --> 26:03.350
l've got business nearby.

26:03.495 --> 26:04.655
How's it going?

26:06.865 --> 26:08.696
A strange thing happened.

26:08.867 --> 26:12.098
Remember Mr. Fox?
He managed Mom's concerts.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.465
Tall, faggoty jerk?

26:14.706 --> 26:17.072
l ran into him, we talked.
Guess what?

26:17.575 --> 26:19.167
He asked me for an audition.

26:21.412 --> 26:22.436
Audition? You?

26:23.581 --> 26:24.946
Why not me?

26:26.251 --> 26:27.445
Think l'm not up to it?

26:27.685 --> 26:29.516
Audition for what?

26:30.555 --> 26:33.115
l don't know yet. Depends.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.157
Depends on what?

26:36.161 --> 26:37.492
Look how your mom ended up.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.093
Don't talk about her that way.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.857
What way do you want?

26:43.968 --> 26:45.993
Your Fox is a pimp.

26:46.371 --> 26:49.135
He didn't deal
with her fits like l did.

26:50.475 --> 26:54.036
At the end, you didn't even see her.
lt was me she talked to.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.471
Don't give me that shit.

26:57.582 --> 26:58.913
What's it to be?

26:59.083 --> 27:00.573
Same as him.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.119
Remember that favor l asked you?

27:06.691 --> 27:07.885
What favor?

27:08.426 --> 27:11.827
<i>The couscous jerk
who owes me six months rent.</i>

27:11.963 --> 27:13.021
Sorry, no time.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.422
No time?

27:16.601 --> 27:19.832
Time to see that fag
and get psyched up about pianos,

27:20.004 --> 27:21.972
but not 20 minutes for me.

27:22.774 --> 27:25.242
Don't get anal about it. l forgot.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.104
l'll see him, end of story.

27:28.346 --> 27:30.507
That's handy. He's across the street.

27:36.654 --> 27:39.851
l don't believe it!
How can you pull this on me?

27:40.024 --> 27:41.855
You said you'd do it, do it.

27:42.026 --> 27:43.994
ls this payback time or what?

27:44.429 --> 27:46.522
Will you do it or not?

27:46.664 --> 27:48.427
No way! Not like this.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.931
Fix your own shit.

27:52.403 --> 27:53.427
Right.

28:14.893 --> 28:16.155
Asshole.

28:59.103 --> 29:00.161
Beat it!

29:09.948 --> 29:11.711
Mounir! The kitchen's on fire!

29:11.950 --> 29:13.577
Quick! There's a fire!

29:28.766 --> 29:29.755
Freeze!

29:31.970 --> 29:32.959
My dad's money!

29:42.647 --> 29:44.638
Touch my dad again, l'll kill you.

30:00.798 --> 30:01.765
Here.

30:03.701 --> 30:05.464
Not so hard, was it?

30:08.306 --> 30:10.900
Do me a favor.
Forget me for a while.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.604
ls that how you want it?

30:17.648 --> 30:19.741
How else do you want it?

30:27.558 --> 30:29.082
Dammit, Dad!

31:44.102 --> 31:46.229
My friend, Miao Lin.

31:47.004 --> 31:48.699
What is your name?

31:59.150 --> 32:00.583
What do you need exactly?

32:00.751 --> 32:03.242
For an audition,
to know where l stand.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.225
Hold it. Doesn't
she speak French?

32:09.393 --> 32:11.258
She only just got here.

32:12.897 --> 32:14.091
Only Chinese?

32:14.265 --> 32:17.496
Chinese, Viet, and a little English.

32:21.572 --> 32:23.335
Does it matter, no French?

32:26.744 --> 32:29.110
No smoking, no talking?
Pain in the...

32:30.014 --> 32:32.244
We will work it out, don't worry.

32:32.416 --> 32:35.146
She can coach you real well.

32:36.087 --> 32:39.147
She has coached musicians
for competitions.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.023
She is very good.

32:43.494 --> 32:44.688
Do you need some tea?

32:45.596 --> 32:48.429
What about timing and money?

32:54.572 --> 33:00.636
Mornings she has classes,
otherwise she's free.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.745
Every day at 2 PM, OK?

33:15.359 --> 33:16.792
That one looks good.

33:16.961 --> 33:18.758
lt's pushing it, sizewise.

33:18.896 --> 33:22.423
Over 350 square meters,
City Hall may poke its nose in.

33:24.569 --> 33:27.436
You're trading business
premises for housing...

33:27.605 --> 33:31.336
Can you show me
Montmorency Villas again?

33:31.475 --> 33:32.669
Same problem.

33:32.843 --> 33:34.367
l have an architect friend...

33:40.051 --> 33:42.611
l'm Thomas Seyr.
Mr. Fox asked me to call.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.552
He told you?

33:45.656 --> 33:47.055
An audition, yes.

33:47.825 --> 33:48.985
Date?

33:50.361 --> 33:51.487
l don't know.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.261
What's available?

33:55.733 --> 33:57.325
l'll hold.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.063
We've made a shortlist.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.764
l forgot something.

34:33.971 --> 34:37.668
Seyr again. We got cut off.
Go on, l'm listening.

34:40.311 --> 34:42.210
The 23rd? 11 o'clock?

34:42.580 --> 34:43.808
Suits me fine.

34:45.949 --> 34:48.350
Where? What's the address?

34:59.730 --> 35:01.630
Are you busy tonight?

35:01.832 --> 35:02.821
Why?

35:02.967 --> 35:05.026
l told Aline we're having dinner.

35:05.169 --> 35:06.033
Again?

35:06.170 --> 35:09.333
She'll believe it if she sees you.
Pick me up from home.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.134
l cross town so you get laid?

35:11.309 --> 35:12.276
Attaboy!

35:12.443 --> 35:14.536
- Who is she?
- Who cares?

35:14.712 --> 35:16.179
Tell me or l won't come.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.076
The realty chick from uptown.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.274
- Same as before?
- The other one.

35:20.718 --> 35:23.050
- l won't do it.
- Asshole!

35:31.929 --> 35:34.363
- You've come for him?
- We're running late.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.363
Dinner with a client?

35:36.534 --> 35:38.468
- How've you been?
- OK.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.625
Will you be out late?

35:39.970 --> 35:41.369
Not very.

35:45.743 --> 35:47.938
- Does he know l'm here?
- He's on the phone.

35:48.112 --> 35:50.637
- Fabrice! Tom's here.
- Coming!

35:56.654 --> 35:57.882
Night, honey.

35:58.222 --> 35:59.348
l won't be late.

36:02.727 --> 36:03.557
Bye.

36:06.163 --> 36:07.755
She suspects something.

36:08.366 --> 36:10.493
She doesn't suspect, in fact...

36:10.668 --> 36:12.101
she's happy l'm with you.

36:12.269 --> 36:13.896
Next time, know what?

36:14.071 --> 36:16.232
We change tactics. You drive me home.

36:18.709 --> 36:21.872
To save me from driving home drunk.
Dig it?

36:22.046 --> 36:23.377
ls that all?

36:25.015 --> 36:27.745
You smug, skirt-chasing smartass!

36:28.386 --> 36:30.013
Don't you have any class?

36:31.155 --> 36:33.146
Don't forget the bank tomorrow.

36:33.324 --> 36:36.350
The loan for the Massy place.
You want half, do half the work.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.256
- What time?
- 11.

36:43.334 --> 36:47.566
<i>Horowitz was the magician
who reveaIed aII the piano's magic...</i>

36:49.373 --> 36:51.773
<i>and especiaIIy its sparkIe.</i>

36:55.513 --> 36:59.108
<i>He had the most
marveIous pianist's hands...</i>

37:00.484 --> 37:03.942
<i>Iike a deIicateIy muscIed racehorse.</i>

37:39.790 --> 37:41.485
l can't do it.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.890
Having somebody
behind me puts me off.

37:46.063 --> 37:49.499
l can't take it. lt won't work.
l'm not used to it.

37:50.267 --> 37:52.667
Come over here. Stand here.

37:56.207 --> 37:57.139
Look that way.

39:28.365 --> 39:29.627
Two Jacks on the rocks.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.531
Guess what? Verodin told me
he wants to build on the east side.

39:34.438 --> 39:38.272
He's tight with the lllouz
brothers, so l kept quiet.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.705
But he came on strong,
'l want to work with you guys.'

39:42.646 --> 39:44.978
l told him about
the Bussy flour mills.

39:45.449 --> 39:48.748
Guess what? He said he's through
with the lllouz brothers.

39:48.953 --> 39:51.046
He's sick of getting shafted.

40:32.229 --> 40:33.890
That's Number 172,

40:34.231 --> 40:35.926
with the vacant lot.

40:37.001 --> 40:40.937
The homeowner's getting divorced.
He'll need dough.

40:41.338 --> 40:44.830
Stick our card in his mailbox,
he'll call us next week.

40:46.644 --> 40:49.078
- That's not my car.
- lt's mine.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.648
lf you puke, you go in the trunk.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.520
Stand up!

41:07.598 --> 41:08.690
ls that you?

41:08.866 --> 41:09.855
Who else?

41:10.734 --> 41:11.792
Everything OK?

41:12.069 --> 41:13.161
l am.

41:15.339 --> 41:17.933
l put him there.
You want him in the bedroom?

41:18.108 --> 41:18.870
That's fine.

41:19.009 --> 41:21.534
- Well, l'll...
- Wait a sec.

41:33.357 --> 41:36.485
Fabrice said he may sell this place.
ls it true?

41:37.127 --> 41:38.617
He didn't tell me.

41:39.863 --> 41:41.558
ls business bad?

41:41.965 --> 41:43.227
Not good.

42:10.994 --> 42:12.325
Another drink?

42:13.664 --> 42:14.892
Yeah, OK.

42:15.799 --> 42:17.733
One more and l'll go.

43:00.778 --> 43:01.836
Like this?

43:34.011 --> 43:35.569
Yeah, l know.

43:38.048 --> 43:39.276
Like this?

44:16.320 --> 44:19.289
Excuse me.
l need to talk to my partner.

44:19.923 --> 44:21.151
There's a room next door.

44:22.059 --> 44:23.993
Are you trying to screw me?

44:25.262 --> 44:26.627
lt's not what we said.

44:27.164 --> 44:28.859
lt's not the same price.

44:29.032 --> 44:31.000
What's my call to Martens worth?

44:32.436 --> 44:33.733
Name a price.

44:35.372 --> 44:37.397
You're a rat!

44:37.541 --> 44:39.805
Stop right there!

44:40.477 --> 44:43.605
Rats are lazy slobs
who live off other people's work!

44:43.780 --> 44:47.614
You want to redraft the contract
and meet with your lawyer?

45:11.074 --> 45:11.768
lt's me.

48:00.877 --> 48:01.707
Hi there!

48:03.180 --> 48:04.704
Been out on the town?

48:04.881 --> 48:05.905
l went to a movie.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.278
Which one?
Hungry? They're closing.

48:08.885 --> 48:09.909
l'm OK.

48:10.420 --> 48:11.682
Have a seat.

48:13.824 --> 48:15.451
You've been eating?

48:18.562 --> 48:19.790
What's the matter?

48:21.565 --> 48:22.395
That's odd.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.858
What?

48:26.002 --> 48:27.526
lsn't Fabrice with you?

48:27.737 --> 48:29.398
No, why?

48:30.807 --> 48:33.799
We're eating later but l got hungry.

48:33.977 --> 48:35.001
l skipped lunch.

48:35.178 --> 48:37.669
We're meeting with a client uptown...

48:39.382 --> 48:41.316
That's it.

48:47.757 --> 48:48.985
How will you warn him?

48:50.327 --> 48:53.091
Call him on your cell phone
from the john?

48:53.663 --> 48:56.496
'She's here, help!
What do l do?'

49:00.504 --> 49:02.563
How long have you been fooling me?

49:07.577 --> 49:08.976
Fooling you? How?

49:11.581 --> 49:12.673
Skip it.

49:13.650 --> 49:15.515
How long's it been going on?

49:17.721 --> 49:18.915
l dunno.

49:20.490 --> 49:22.355
How can you not know?

49:24.761 --> 49:26.592
Since day one, l guess.

49:29.566 --> 49:33.093
Whenever he says he's going out
with you, he's getting laid?

49:33.370 --> 49:34.598
Listen...

49:37.307 --> 49:38.365
One girl or several?

49:38.508 --> 49:40.908
Gimme a break! l don't fuckin' know.

49:41.111 --> 49:43.875
- You never see them?
- No, and l don't care!

49:45.615 --> 49:48.277
- Don't care?
- l don't give a shit.

49:49.352 --> 49:50.250
Why do you do it?

49:51.021 --> 49:52.454
Why l do it?

49:54.224 --> 49:55.156
You wouldn't understand.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.294
Listen...

50:13.877 --> 50:15.310
Aline, wait!

50:16.046 --> 50:17.479
Stay away from me!

50:20.584 --> 50:21.608
Wait!

50:23.019 --> 50:24.043
Fuck off!

50:24.221 --> 50:25.916
Why do l cover for him?

50:26.456 --> 50:28.583
- Because l love you.
- Get lost.

50:28.825 --> 50:31.157
Did you hear me? l love you!

50:31.962 --> 50:34.260
That's how it is. l want you.

50:41.438 --> 50:43.099
Did you never feel it?

50:43.340 --> 50:46.070
- What?
- Something between us.

50:47.744 --> 50:49.803
So it's all in my mind?

50:50.714 --> 50:52.079
- Yes.
- lt can't be!

50:52.249 --> 50:55.946
Whenever we meet, we're tongue-tied
and shy, like two little kids.

50:56.119 --> 50:59.452
ls that normal?
Am l making it up?

50:59.856 --> 51:01.687
Honestly, am l?

51:06.296 --> 51:07.194
ldiot.

51:08.064 --> 51:10.624
You know l'm not making it up.

51:23.580 --> 51:26.447
- So, what now?
- l don't know.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.364
l have to go. He'll be home soon.

52:20.770 --> 52:22.897
What do you care? Stay.

52:24.841 --> 52:26.001
Stay.

52:27.010 --> 52:28.238
l can't.

52:49.666 --> 52:51.998
l'm leaving. Let's call each other.

54:59.963 --> 55:01.396
That's good.

55:09.939 --> 55:12.533
God, you're making my day.

55:13.810 --> 55:17.246
lf you're so damn good, show me.

55:43.239 --> 55:44.433
l play like that?

55:47.410 --> 55:48.741
No, come off it.

55:59.088 --> 56:00.055
l get it!

56:00.256 --> 56:01.223
Of course!

56:02.458 --> 56:03.288
Move over.

56:25.548 --> 56:26.674
Faucet.

56:30.587 --> 56:31.554
And this?

56:32.589 --> 56:33.521
Glass.

56:33.690 --> 56:36.716
Wrong. Cup.

56:40.530 --> 56:41.724
And this?

56:43.733 --> 56:44.893
Matches.

56:47.570 --> 56:48.867
What's this?

56:52.175 --> 56:53.233
Saucepan.

56:55.378 --> 56:56.504
Bad!

57:12.128 --> 57:15.996
lf you couldn't make the meeting,
why didn't you call me?

57:16.132 --> 57:17.861
Did you make it to the bank?

57:18.034 --> 57:19.934
You got the files, didn't you?

57:20.136 --> 57:21.694
For fuck's sake...

57:22.038 --> 57:24.302
His secretary's gonna try and catch him.

57:26.142 --> 57:27.939
Anything else you maybe forgot?

57:28.077 --> 57:30.011
- Alright already.
- What's alright?

57:30.213 --> 57:32.181
l messed up. Nobody died.

57:32.348 --> 57:35.249
- lf we lose the permit, we're fucked.
- l realize that.

57:37.086 --> 57:39.953
- So what do we do?
- You got his secretary. What can l do?

57:40.223 --> 57:42.657
Nothing. lt's the best thing.

57:42.825 --> 57:44.452
l'm sick of this. Later.

57:48.398 --> 57:50.559
So what's going on? Because...

57:50.800 --> 57:52.324
Nothing.

57:53.136 --> 57:55.764
Nothing?
You don't want to tell me?

57:55.938 --> 57:57.530
Tell you what?

57:57.740 --> 58:00.174
Playing piano is making you flip?

58:00.743 --> 58:01.971
Stop it. Now!

58:02.145 --> 58:05.239
Nothing's making me flip.
l'm not flipping.

58:06.115 --> 58:08.709
l'm having a ball. l feel fantastic!

58:09.352 --> 58:10.717
Don't you see?

58:10.920 --> 58:13.218
lt's important. l'm serious about it.

58:13.356 --> 58:14.345
lt's wicked.

58:14.557 --> 58:16.252
You gonna make dough from pianos?

58:16.459 --> 58:18.154
Not pianos. The piano!

58:18.327 --> 58:20.852
lt's not about making money.
lt's about art.

58:21.230 --> 58:23.027
What's in it for us?

58:23.599 --> 58:25.965
You coming to meetings all mellow?

58:26.102 --> 58:28.730
'Hi guys, l've been playing piano.'

58:29.505 --> 58:31.473
Shit, l'll take up the banjo.

58:33.042 --> 58:36.273
- lt's over your head.
- lt isn't at all.

58:36.546 --> 58:38.571
Do what you like to relax after hours.

58:38.748 --> 58:44.243
l make balsa models with my kids
and l still keep my appointments.

58:44.454 --> 58:48.447
But it's not about appointments.
You don't seem on the ball.

58:49.926 --> 58:52.258
Get on the ball, then do what you want.

58:52.428 --> 58:55.329
Collect Panini figures, baseball cards,

58:55.465 --> 58:57.660
do your piano, nobody cares.

58:59.836 --> 59:02.327
Did you tell your dad?

59:02.605 --> 59:04.368
- Yeah.
- What did he say?

59:05.475 --> 59:07.670
- lt grabs him.
- Grabs him?

59:13.049 --> 59:14.073
lt's me.

59:14.250 --> 59:15.478
How's it going?

59:16.586 --> 59:18.076
What are you doing now?

59:19.288 --> 59:20.755
Thinking of me?

59:20.890 --> 59:22.084
All the time?

59:22.258 --> 59:24.852
Think of me all the time.
l think of you.

59:25.228 --> 59:26.661
l need to see you.

59:27.897 --> 59:29.228
Please!

59:30.600 --> 59:33.160
l've had a shitty day.
Don't you start.

59:33.302 --> 59:34.667
What are you wearing?

59:35.037 --> 59:37.801
lt matters. Pants? A dress?

59:40.510 --> 59:42.205
God, l knew it!

59:42.612 --> 59:44.239
What underneath?

59:44.413 --> 59:46.074
Stockings? Panties?

59:46.816 --> 59:49.182
You don't have to shout. Whisper.

59:51.454 --> 59:53.684
Pantyhose? Any panties?

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.731
Do you love me or not?

01:00:09.972 --> 01:00:11.439
You love me!

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.416
Do you still fuck him?

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.582
Do you still fuck Fabrice?

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.854
What's wrong with you?

01:00:26.989 --> 01:00:29.958
l'm only asking if you fuck.
Yes or no?

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.093
You have no right to ask me that.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.595
So that's it!

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:38.632
When you leave me, you fuck him.

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.294
He's my husband!

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.666
l know. And what am l?

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:45.203
Why not ask me
if l fuck someone else?

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.672
lt's none of my business.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.779
Of course it is, if you love me.

01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:54.946
- Do you fuck someone else?
- Yeah.

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:57.584
You fuck someone else?

01:00:58.654 --> 01:00:59.712
Careful!

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:26.105
Shut up.

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.777
Get off my ass!

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.753
l don't understand you!

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:35.914
This is all useless!
l'm sick of it!

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.365
Where? l can't see you.

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:22.996
What bus shelter?

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.039
l'm there.

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.645
l see you. l'm coming.

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.500
ls it bad?
Need a hospital?

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:02.166
Take me home.

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:03.805
Get a move on!

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:14.487
Lean forward.

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:21.027
Breathe deep.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.805
What do you care
what happened to me?

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.845
We're done talking, right?

01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:56.361
You gonna sit there all day
staring at me like a mutt?

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:02.232
Suit yourself.
See if l care.

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:11.144
Shit!

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:56.820
What's the matter with you?

01:04:56.992 --> 01:04:57.981
Stop it!

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:03.992
OK, now.

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:15.705
l was set to get half the site
just by putting up the cash deposit.

01:05:18.013 --> 01:05:22.780
The site was valued at two million
but easily worth double.

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.047
Gently!

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:26.378
That hurt?

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:28.614
- Want another pill?
- l'm OK.

01:05:32.027 --> 01:05:35.929
l figured a profit of 2.5 million
on 300,000...

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.066
wasn't bad.

01:05:42.304 --> 01:05:44.932
So l put up the cash and we signed.

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:49.537
A month later, l heard
the city had blocked the sale

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:53.115
so l asked him to pay back my cash.

01:05:53.782 --> 01:05:57.775
He said sure, Monday, no problem.

01:05:58.787 --> 01:06:00.584
Come Monday, zilch.

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.087
How long ago was it?

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:04.692
About... three months.

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:09.459
l kept at him
but he stopped taking my calls.

01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:13.133
- Socks?
- Leave them on.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:17.861
When l heard he was in town,
l went there.

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:19.707
Who is he?

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:22.771
His name is...

01:06:23.712 --> 01:06:25.270
Minskov.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:28.343
You don't know him.
He's a Russian.

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.384
Where did you find him?

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:33.052
The Riviera, where else?

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.214
You don't say.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.157
Can you handle it?

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.861
No answer?

01:06:41.363 --> 01:06:42.887
What do you expect me to say?

01:06:47.102 --> 01:06:49.627
- How's your fiancée?
- lt's over.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.172
Call me!

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.082
What happened with my dad?

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:09.050
- That's why you wanted to see me?
- Not specially.

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:12.854
But l need to know what happened.
Shouldn't l care about him?

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:16.225
- No. He's the father, not you.
- l'm not sure anymore.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:18.927
Did you walk out?

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:21.767
He dumped me.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:26.364
Beat me to it by an inch.
He'd become a total pain.

01:07:26.508 --> 01:07:28.703
Always griping and yelling at me.

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:30.276
You said you had fun.

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.715
At first. lt wore off.

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:39.220
l'm going to ask you something.

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.515
Go back to him.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:43.855
Are you crazy?

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.617
Wait, l know what you'll say.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.462
- l say no.
- Wait.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.463
Think of it as a contract,

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:56.301
like a role in a film.

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.697
You act.
l'm the producer, l cough up.

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:01.065
How much do you get as a model?

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:05.277
l'll pay you the same.
No, double! lt's worth it.

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.174
Just stick with him,

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.645
watch what he gets up to.

01:08:09.818 --> 01:08:13.811
l'll call you twice a day
and you'll tell me if he's doing OK.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:15.190
That's all.

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:18.349
lf something goes wrong
or he starts acting weird

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:20.756
or you lose him,

01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:22.227
give me a call.

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:24.457
See? Nothing to it, right?

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:30.060
l'm not a whore, you know.

01:08:30.471 --> 01:08:33.930
What do you mean?
Who says you're a whore?

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:35.365
You.

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.104
You did. Robert told me.

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:41.777

Can't expect miracles!

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.010

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.062
Mr. Minskov, please.

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:10.301
Did Mr. Minskov go out?

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:13.298
He's in the pool.
Should l call him?

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:15.067
Don't bother him.

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:46.132
St. James Albany Hotel?
Mr. Minskov, please.

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.073
lt's personal.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:57.878
Mr. Minskov?

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.784
l'm Mr. Seyr's son.
You don't know me...

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:05.119
Don't you speak French?

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.925
Don't speak French, asshole?
What an asshole!

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.798
You understand scumbag,
motherfucker?

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:15.834

01:11:16.004 --> 01:11:17.335

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.436
Gloogloo?

01:11:20.642 --> 01:11:21.836
You look pretty glooey!

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:24.309
Listen! Money.
You understand that?

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:27.742
Remember Robert Seyr, fuckwit?

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:32.351
Listen, Gloogloo...

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:32.146
Can l talk to you, Miss?

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.873
- Hang on, there's a guy...
- l need to talk.

01:12:37.452 --> 01:12:39.249
Lotsa love. See you tomorrow.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:40.844
Bye-bye.

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.614
- What?
- Minskov owes me money.

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.317
What do l care?

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:50.291
- Are those two apes always with him?
- l'm not talking to you.

01:12:50.465 --> 01:12:52.262
You could answer my question!

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:53.696
Hands off!

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.698
l just want to meet Minskov.

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.636
You're getting boring.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.604
Minskov can drop dead.

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.107
Matter of fact,

01:13:03.745 --> 01:13:05.804
l just need to call him and you're dead.

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.408
l get it.

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.848
That's why you stay with him.

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:18.152
So you can say shit like
'l call him, you're dead.' What a buzz!

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.188
l get it.

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:23.856
But it's the opposite, right?
You're scared shitless.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.091
You're shaking.
You have goosebumps.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:29.669
- Wild, right?
- You need his permission to breathe.

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.465
Are you done?

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:33.038
Fuck off.

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:55.662
- lt's me.
- Again? Go away or l'll scream.

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:58.493
- No need to scream.
- You're a pain!

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.163
Tell me one thing.
l don't understand.

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.773
How old are you?
22, 23, 24?

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:08.773
You're young, not dumb.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.909
Why stick with him?
You don't even speak Russian.

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:18.183
You don't need to.
He just fucks you and slaps you around.

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.454
Forget it.

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.490
Speak up. l can't hear you.
We're all alone.

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.993
We can't see each other.
Just say...

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.199
Whatever. l'm interested.
What did you do before?

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.665
l didn't hear. Say it again.

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.444
l said l should stop...

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.615
What are you doing?
Where are you?

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:49.611
You've moved!

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:51.980
What on earth...

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.178
Make room for me.

01:14:53.855 --> 01:14:54.685
Move over!

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:57.486
Here l come!

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:03.959
What do you mean,
you only had him on the phone?

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:06.396
What did the bastard come up with?

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:09.264
Dad, you're gonna have
to forget your money.

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.567
Forget it.

01:15:11.873 --> 01:15:15.070
Stop thinking about it,
stop counting it at night.

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:17.701
Write it off and move on.

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:19.343
Why?

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:22.108
The guy's dangerous.
He's a thug, a killer.

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:25.683
He's not the lllouz brothers.
He's not one of us.

01:15:25.887 --> 01:15:28.788
You crossed his path.
lt was a mistake.

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:31.724
Forget it.

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:38.326
Hold on.
What did you talk about on the phone?

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:40.861
Just bullshit.

01:15:41.002 --> 01:15:42.867
Didn't you try anything?

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:45.372
l told you, there's no way.

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:52.370
l fucked his girlfriend.

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.846
You fucked his girlfriend?

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.416
l just told you.

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:05.916
l ask you to get my money back
and all you do is fuck his chick?

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:10.763
l don't believe it.
You're turning dumb.

01:16:11.032 --> 01:16:12.465
You're turning very dumb.

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.002
You there, Dad?

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:18.397
She said she'd gone off sex
since they split up.

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:20.364
l thought, no chance.

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:24.163
We snort a line in the john.
Like hitting a magic button. Pow!

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.400
She goes sex-crazy.
Grabs my dick and sucks it.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.376
Can't you say excuse me?

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:31.307
Sorry.

01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:35.008
A real friend!

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:37.781
We went on to her girlfriend's place.

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:41.411
Her girlfriend, man!
We're at it till 5 AM.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:45.954

l told Aline l'm eating with you.

01:17:48.129 --> 01:17:49.118
OK, right.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.574
Don't move.

01:18:06.781 --> 01:18:07.975
Stay like that.

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.184
- What's the matter?
- Wait, please.

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:13.181
l'm cold.

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:15.013
Wait a second.

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:30.456

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:29.512
l'm off.

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.562
You think this'll help?

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:42.792

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:04.450

You heard me? Verodin's buying!
He's leaving tomorrow for two weeks.

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:35.043
- lt can wait two weeks.
- lt can't. He's waiting to sign now.

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:36.548

You know what Verodin's worth?

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:42.279
Fuck him!

- He won't come, God knows why.

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.856
- Are you in there?
- l'm not going out.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.032
Mind explaining?

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:58.035
What's big about tomorrow?

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:01.164
Does it concern Sami and me?

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:03.109
Go to hell.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.768
What's he up to?

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.513

lt's not only your money, it's ours too.
You can't do this to us!

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:20.524
Open this fucking door.

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.826
l'll kick it in. And your head!

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.263
Stop it! They'll call the cops.

01:23:32.473 --> 01:23:34.134
- Which way?
- Don't ask me!

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.181
OK, got it!

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:13.179
Wait! He wants to

01:24:13.514 --> 01:24:14.572
He wants another look.

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.546
- Now?
- Now. Come on.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.151
