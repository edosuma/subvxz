WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:05.305
My name is Lena Grisky
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.740
I have a secret.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.642
I'm a time traveler from 1905

00:08.642 --> 00:11.411
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

(Lena) Previously...
Lena and Max as planned.
(Lena gasps)

00:50.416 --> 00:53.253
I'm so excited to be paired with
Max for the mid-season show.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.388
(Thea) Lena ruins everything.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.791
This performance might be
the biggest moment of my life.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.125
This has to be perfect.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.326
I agree.

01:00.326 --> 01:02.195
I miss Henri.
It's working.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.730
We want
the timepiece and the girl.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.166
But I still don't know
where he is or what he's doing.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.602
"Dear Lena..." Jackpot.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.445
(Lena squeals with excitement)

01:25.185 --> 01:26.352
I can feel you staring.

01:26.352 --> 01:29.890
(giggles) I can't help it.
I'm so excited for the show.

01:29.890 --> 01:33.326
The ants have
occupied my pants.

01:33.326 --> 01:34.227
(Ines chuckles)

01:34.227 --> 01:35.729
Only you can take
a well-known phrase

01:36.162 --> 01:38.832
and make it sound
like it's from the 1900s.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.166
I've got a surprise.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.302
Okay. What is it?

01:42.302 --> 01:44.538
If I told you that would ruin
the wow factor.
Okay.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.207
I've sent you an invitation.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.510
See you there!

01:59.352 --> 02:01.688
(Jeff knocks at the window)

02:06.226 --> 02:07.628
What is all this?

02:08.328 --> 02:10.330
This is a formal breakfast.

02:10.330 --> 02:14.367
Woohoo!
Don't mind if I do... Hmm.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.339
(Jeff humming)

02:19.640 --> 02:22.142
(makes eating noises)

02:24.945 --> 02:26.179
What?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.348
It's just that...

02:28.348 --> 02:31.484
it's not customary
to shove food into your mouth
before everyone's sitting.

02:31.685 --> 02:36.857
(with mouth full)
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
Um... I'm good.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.792
I've put a napkin there for you.

02:38.792 --> 02:39.893
(Dash) Oh wow!

02:41.695 --> 02:44.264
Wow.
Did you make all this yourself?

02:44.464 --> 02:45.699
Oh, it's no big thing.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.270
You get extra points for that.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.538
Well, some of us have manners.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.473
(Lena laughs)

02:53.840 --> 02:55.475
Surprise! (chuckles)

02:55.475 --> 02:58.645
This is my ritual before
any big performance.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.481
And I needed
something from home.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.918
Well, I mean I'll have
to leave soon because
I've got a ritual to do.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.188
But obviously after I've had
this delicious breakfast.

03:08.555 --> 03:11.692
Oh look. Breakfast.
What a treat.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.861
(Lena) I'm so glad you girls
could make it.
Please, help yourselves.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.797
(Thea) No, thank you.
We're not hungry.

03:18.331 --> 03:22.335
This is so nice.
The details. The napkins.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.607
Right. I'm not hungry.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.775
You're not? I'm famished.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.745
Oh look, Lena made
beet and carrot smoothies.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.979
(Bree) Thea's favorite.
How did she know?

03:34.114 --> 03:36.316
I bet she did research.
I love research.
It's so calming.

03:38.451 --> 03:39.385
Uh-huh.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.555
(Bree) Maybe she watches
that cooking show.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.724
Last week was crazy.
They blended...
(sighs)

03:45.626 --> 03:47.894
I'm so nervous.
I can't stop talking
when I'm nervous.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.330
I think it's my genetics.
(stomach rumbles)

03:50.330 --> 03:52.298
Did your stomach just rumble?
No, that wasn't me.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.668
(Thea snaps her fingers)

03:54.668 --> 03:59.339
We should do this again.
(Kennedy) It's like a big family
breakfast. It's just so nice.

03:59.339 --> 04:00.707
This is the best smoothie
I've ever tasted!

04:00.707 --> 04:03.476
(Kennedy) Give me some
while she's not looking.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.311
(Kennedy) What is her secret?

04:05.879 --> 04:07.614
(Lena) Thanks for coming.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.686
I am so excited.
I can't believe we're performing
on the Garnier stage tonight.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.321
This breakfast is just something
that we did back home

04:15.488 --> 04:17.323
on the morning
of a big performance.

04:17.323 --> 04:20.326
And I'm really happy that
I can share it with you all.

04:20.326 --> 04:24.765
(Jeff laughs, then whispers)
Who's gonna tell her?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.332
You.
Me?

04:27.901 --> 04:31.505
Oh, L. This spread is fantastic.
Like...

04:31.505 --> 04:33.339
Amazing. Lovely.
Really top-notch.

04:33.339 --> 04:38.645
But it's Saturday
and the show isn't
until Sunday night.

04:38.645 --> 04:45.719
(Lena) Oops! Well, enjoy it now
because there is no way
I'm doing all of this tomorrow.
(all laugh)

05:03.704 --> 05:06.873
It is Sunday, right?
I haven't blacked out
or anything?

05:06.873 --> 05:09.910
My stomach is in knots.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.445
Shhh...

05:16.517 --> 05:18.084
What?
Nothing.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.461
Lena! Lena!

05:28.461 --> 05:32.566
Great. Now I've lost count
and I need to start again.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.803
Um... what's happening here?

05:36.803 --> 05:38.438
I'm packing, hello?

05:38.438 --> 05:39.973
Hi.

05:45.078 --> 05:48.381
Lena! Lena!
I've got a system!

05:48.381 --> 05:51.484
This is my game day ritual.
Okay?

05:57.390 --> 05:58.424
Hello, me.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.562
Today is the day we get to dance
on the Garnier stage.

06:01.562 --> 06:05.532
(Lena) And that is the fourth
time Ines has packed her bag.

06:12.438 --> 06:13.840
Are you sure
you want to wear that?

06:13.840 --> 06:17.110
Well, if Henri can't be here,
then yes.

06:17.110 --> 06:23.049
I'm going to wear it.
For good luck.
Even if it is against the rules.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.084
Okay, rebel.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.652
Let's roll.

06:25.652 --> 06:30.957
Today is a big day and
I've got stuff to do, remember?
I've got a system. Okay?

06:30.957 --> 06:32.693
Sir, yes, sir! (chuckles)

06:50.711 --> 06:51.778
What are you doing?

06:51.778 --> 06:53.580
What do you mean?

06:53.580 --> 06:57.918
No, I know when you answer a
question with a question that
means you're hiding something.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.756
Really mature.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.731
(giggles) What?

07:10.731 --> 07:12.833
Why are you doing this?
I'm just warming up.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.868
It looks like a lot more
than that to me.

07:14.868 --> 07:18.639
Oh, does it?
It does. You've been in here
for like two hours now.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.675
I woke up energized.
It's part of my ritual.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.578
It's part of your ritual?

07:26.847 --> 07:27.948
And I've never heard of this
ritual before because...?
Because you don't pay attention.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.151
Oh, there we go!
A snappy comment
from Ms Raphael.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.554
And all is alright in the world.

07:45.165 --> 07:50.070
(Jeff) Oh, I feel weird.
Does anyone else feel weird?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.638
I shouldn't have had eggs
this morning.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.608
We all had eggs.
It's not the eggs.

07:55.942 --> 08:00.113
This is totally random,
but ankle socks
might be the best invention.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.083
Ever.
I must remember
to take some home.

08:04.785 --> 08:08.522
She watched TV this morning.
After spending two hours
in the studio.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.256
Oh no, she did not!
Is the world ending?

08:10.256 --> 08:13.594
Unclear.
Be prepared
for literally anything.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.162
Come on, girls.
We don't want to be late
for the big day.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.600
Let's do this!
(Lena exhales)

08:19.600 --> 08:24.004
(ticking clock,
magical tinkling noises)

08:27.808 --> 08:31.578
(Henri groans)

08:33.013 --> 08:34.615
Tie him to the chair.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.584
No! No! (groans)

08:38.652 --> 08:39.520
Henri?

08:40.921 --> 08:45.058
Now you're gonna watch us
get through that portal,
leaving you here.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.094
And you're never gonna get
to see Lena again.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.230
(Henri) Please! No!

08:52.766 --> 08:55.636
(Frank) Nice work, Clive.
Uh, Frank?

08:55.636 --> 08:58.104
Not now.
I'm working on the plan.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.277
Okay, boys.

09:04.277 --> 09:09.082
Tonight we're gonna take
the port-a-portal to the Garnier
for a surprise visit.

09:10.350 --> 09:14.054
How many times do I have
to tell you: you don't need
to raise your hand?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.790
Probably a few more.
I have a question.
I know.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.693
I get the whole timepiece thing.
I mean, that's all
you can talk about.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.094
But who's the girl again?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.763
(Frank and Pinky) Lena!
Ah, yeah.

09:22.763 --> 09:28.602
As I was saying, tonight's
the night, as long as we can
get this bad boy working.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.804
Let's test it.
On it!

09:32.438 --> 09:35.709
Hey, not fair! I was the one
who brought back that magical
device from the future.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.310
I should be the one
who gets to do the test run.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.146
Do you think you can handle it?
I'm not an idiot.

09:40.146 --> 09:43.784
I'm going to jump through
that portal and go get that
princess girl all by myself.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.052
No, you're not.
No?

09:46.286 --> 09:49.222
I'll tell you what, though.
I'm going to put you
in charge of Henri.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.893
That's a really important job.
Yeah, hear that?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.962
(portal whirring)

09:57.230 --> 10:02.202
(electric noises)
(Pinky) It works.
You're a genius.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.344
Wow.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.796
(Jeff) Uh oh. Drama alert.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.065
Thea could explode
at any second.

10:32.065 --> 10:36.336
Dude, it's all about
being an understudy.
You should know that.

10:37.437 --> 10:41.141
Uh...
Oh, I feel sick again.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.677
It's gotta be those eggs.
Not the eggs, Jeff.

10:48.214 --> 10:51.685
Hey, T. How's it going?

10:53.053 --> 10:56.823
Oh, I'm excellent, Jeffrey.
Thanks for asking.

10:58.959 --> 11:04.197

costumes fitting's over.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.265
What does that have to do
with anything?

11:39.265 --> 11:44.871
It's not the eggs. It's nerves.
It happens to all of us.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.273
(Jeff) I don't get nervous.
You know that.

11:47.273 --> 11:51.111
It means you care, Jeff.
And that's okay.

11:51.111 --> 11:57.317
Come on, soak it all in.
This is what it's all about.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.185
(Jeff) I still think
it's the eggs.

11:59.185 --> 12:02.022
(all together)
It's not the eggs!

12:02.322 --> 12:03.356

12:16.803 --> 12:19.072
Frank...
Wait for it.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.875
What if he's gone forever?
Nobody asked you.

12:23.443 --> 12:29.983
Five, four, three, two, one...

12:29.983 --> 12:33.319
(portal starts whirring,
electric noises)

12:35.121 --> 12:36.356
(Clive) Pinky!

12:36.990 --> 12:40.460
Good news and bad news, lads.
The bad news?

12:40.460 --> 12:41.928
These hats
are all the rage in 2038.

12:42.896 --> 12:46.800
The good news?
The port-a-portal works.

12:59.012 --> 13:03.016
(classical music plays)

13:07.521 --> 13:10.490
Oh, come on.
Get over it already!

13:10.490 --> 13:13.193
I don't know what
you're talking about, Jeffrey.

13:15.361 --> 13:20.033
(copies Thea) "This is my role.
He's my boyfriend
and this is an outrage!

13:20.033 --> 13:22.869
I should alert
the entire world!"

13:23.336 --> 13:25.471
Everything's fine, Jeffrey.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.923
Oh yeah.
I forgot about your whole
good luck ritual thing.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.324
Remind me, again?

13:46.560 --> 13:50.196
I do a hundred jumping jacks,
a hundred push-ups,
and a hundred sit-ups.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.633
And every single time,
I deliver a sick performance.

13:52.633 --> 13:53.600
Dash, it's a whole thing.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.037
(laughs) Well,
I'm gonna warm up with you.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.607
If you've never had a bad
performance, this must work.

14:00.607 --> 14:04.611
Dash, this isn't a joke.
Now I need to start again.
Thanks a lot.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.263
(Thea) Break a leg tonight,
Lena. I mean that sincerely.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.232
Thank you, Thea.
You as well.

15:02.335 --> 15:07.273
Hey, you're quiet today.
What's up?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.443
I'm just thinking about Henri.

15:11.612 --> 15:14.480
I wish he was here
to see us perform tonight.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.351
Oh yeah, I guess Russia's a
long way to go for a show, huh?

15:22.255 --> 15:26.059
I don't know why I can't stop
thinking about him today.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.563
You miss your guy, L.
That's cool.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.703
Hm, too bad he can't dance.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.373
Yeah, he's a total disaster.

15:40.373 --> 15:44.410
Yeah.
And not cute.
Like, at all.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.013
(announcer) One hour to curtain.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.952
Max looks okay, right?
Like okay to go on?

15:53.053 --> 15:55.355
Not sick, from those eggs?

15:55.989 --> 15:57.724
He's fine.

16:00.060 --> 16:03.096
I don't wanna... No!
Come on.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.197
(Lena laughs)

16:11.137 --> 16:14.407
(people chattering)

16:15.776 --> 16:18.612
(Bree) And she's wearing a
different shade of lipstick.
(Kennedy) So...?

16:18.612 --> 16:20.647
It's called "Red Scandal".

16:20.647 --> 16:22.716
(gasps) It is not.

16:23.784 --> 16:28.221
Uh oh. That's a bad sign.
And it's super weird
that she's not even here.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.090
Super weird.
I just said that.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.457
Me too.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.664
It's not weird
that Thea's not here, Lena.
Just so you know.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.634
Yeah, thanks for the update,
Einstein.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.538
There is no way
Bree's related to Einstein.

16:44.538 --> 16:46.439
It's just an expression.
Oh...

16:49.342 --> 16:52.312
Everybody looks lovely.

16:53.814 --> 16:56.750
Enjoy every moment of tonight.
You've earned it.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.685
Go out there and make me proud.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.455
(bell rings)
(Lena and Ines giggle)

17:15.068 --> 17:16.770
Just think, gents.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.674
In a few short hours,
we are going
to control time travel

17:20.674 --> 17:23.143
which means
we will control time itself.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.346
Mwahaha...

17:30.751 --> 17:33.854
(portal whirs, electric noises)

17:33.854 --> 17:35.589
See you, Henri.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.059
Mwahaha...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.833
Clive really doesn't know
how to tie a knot.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.637
Okay...

17:50.637 --> 17:56.442
What the boys did looked easy
so I just set it to the bridge.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.078
We should be good to go.

18:07.521 --> 18:13.326
(classical music plays)

18:22.335 --> 18:24.270
(Ines exhales)

19:01.374 --> 19:02.709
What are you doing?

19:05.679 --> 19:06.813
What's this?

19:06.813 --> 19:08.314
You better get reading.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.888
Henri's here! Right now.

19:15.856 --> 19:18.291
Oh no.
He's not at the Garnier.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.261
He wants to meet
at the Alexandre III bridge
at eight o'clock.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.496
Oh no.
It's eight o'clock right now.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.566
Where did you get this?

19:27.133 --> 19:29.335
That's a lot of questions
for someone who needs
to be in two places at once.

19:29.970 --> 19:32.673
What are you going to do, Lena?

19:34.975 --> 19:36.242
How could you do this?

19:37.243 --> 19:38.912
You can meet your boyfriend
or you can dance.

19:40.413 --> 19:43.684
If you want my opinion,
that letter seems pretty urgent.
But, it's up to you.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.520
(exhales nervously)

19:50.290 --> 19:51.892
Ten seconds.

19:55.696 --> 19:58.231
This isn't over.

19:58.599 --> 20:01.467
Lena, what's going on?
Why is Thea dancing your part?

20:02.603 --> 20:05.606
Henri's here but he's not here.
He wants to meet me
at a bridge. Now.

20:05.606 --> 20:06.873
Wait. What?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.942
The Time Collectors
are on their way
and they're after me.

20:10.544 --> 20:13.013
There's another portal
at the Alexandre III bridge
and we're taking it tonight.

20:13.013 --> 20:14.848
But how did Thea..
I don't know.

20:14.848 --> 20:17.684
But I'm not going to be here
to make her pay
for ruining everything.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.721
Don't worry.
I've got your back, okay?

20:28.562 --> 20:32.799
(whooshing sound,
electric noises)

20:32.799 --> 20:37.771
We made it, lads.
Okay, try to blend in,
and let's get to work.

20:37.771 --> 20:39.540
Ooh! Great games.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.508
(girl) Ines' solo was so good!
Clive!

20:41.508 --> 20:44.778
(girl) I know, but why is Thea
dancing Lena's part?
No, no, no, no!

20:44.778 --> 20:49.583
Pay atten... Pay attention.
And stick to the plan.

20:50.984 --> 20:54.588
There have just been
so many plans.
Which one's this one again?

20:54.588 --> 20:57.924
Get the girl.
Get the timepiece.
Meet back at the portal.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.326
And by girl you mean...
(Frank and Pinky) Lena!

21:00.326 --> 21:00.961
Lena!

21:00.961 --> 21:03.296
(Lena and Ines talking)

21:06.399 --> 21:08.669
(Frank) There she is. Go.

21:16.510 --> 21:18.845
Thank you for being
the best friend a girl
could ever ask for.

21:29.890 --> 21:31.357
(both laugh)

21:32.392 --> 21:34.661
You can do this.

21:35.896 --> 21:37.363
(Lena) Who's your best friend?

21:37.363 --> 21:40.033
A ballerina called Lena.
Who's yours?

21:40.033 --> 21:42.035
A wild child named Ines.
(Ines chuckles)

21:45.972 --> 21:47.774
Thank you for everything.
(the audience applauds)

21:52.412 --> 21:53.880
(Lena) The Time Collectors.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.921
Distract them with this.
This is what they want.
I have to get Henri.

22:00.921 --> 22:02.388
Okay. Run! I've got this.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.725
(classical music plays)

22:10.864 --> 22:11.932
(Lena) Max...

22:42.963 --> 22:44.464
(the audience gasp)

22:45.899 --> 22:48.068
(the audience laugh)

22:51.171 --> 22:53.540
(the audience clamor)

23:12.492 --> 23:13.560
Looking for this?

23:14.795 --> 23:17.497
My whole life...
There must be something
wrong with my eyes,

23:17.497 --> 23:19.165
because I can't
take them off of you.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.734
What is your name?

23:20.734 --> 23:23.169
Ines... but don't even...

23:23.169 --> 23:25.506
If beauty were time,
you'd be eternity.

23:26.607 --> 23:28.942
Where's Lena?
As if I'd tell you.

23:28.942 --> 23:31.812
I don't care how cute you are.

23:35.215 --> 23:37.083
(Frank) We've been spotted.
We've got to go, now.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.553
I can't lose her, mate.
She's the love of my life.

23:41.087 --> 23:46.459
Ha! I've never seen a
prettier girl in my entire life.
She's perfection.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.662
You see a pretty girl
every thirty seconds.

23:48.662 --> 23:50.130
Not like her.
She's different.

23:50.964 --> 23:52.899
Where's Clive?
We've got to go.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.301
(Frank and Pinky) Clive!
Oh, hey, gents.

23:55.301 --> 23:59.606
Look at this. You get points
every time the big crane
picks up the fruity bits. Aw...

23:59.606 --> 24:02.576
Come on, Ines.
Where are you, Ines?

24:02.943 --> 24:05.111
Aha!
Stop this.

24:05.111 --> 24:09.082
(reads as he texts) "Do you
believe in love at first sight?

24:09.082 --> 24:11.818
Or should I walk by again?"
Pinky?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.153
(phone beeps)

24:16.723 --> 24:21.995
"Do you believe
in love at first sight,
or should I walk by again?"

24:21.995 --> 24:25.999
Eew. It's totally
from that guy, Dirk.

24:30.671 --> 24:34.107
So we've got the timepiece,
what about the girl, hm?

24:34.508 --> 24:37.043
(Clive) They're all over
the place, Frank.
Can you not see them?

24:37.043 --> 24:41.615
Oh no... Am I the only one
who can see them?

24:41.615 --> 24:44.585
I cannot believe you two.
How could you just
lose her like that?

24:44.585 --> 24:46.052
I was busy meeting the love of
my life.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.755
Too late, now, Pinky. Because
They're after us.

24:48.989 --> 24:52.258
(Frank) We've got to go, now.
Go.
(Pinky whistles)

24:55.729 --> 24:58.031
Guys? I think it's closed.

24:58.031 --> 24:59.533
Do you, Clive?

24:59.533 --> 25:01.067
Yeah, it seems
closed to me, Frank.

25:02.202 --> 25:05.739
Which one of you messed
with the portal before we left?

25:05.739 --> 25:08.008
And by which one of you,
I mean you, Clive.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.743
Why do I always get blamed?

25:09.743 --> 25:13.680
All I said to Henri before
we left was "Don't worry mate,
I didn't tie you too tight."

25:14.014 --> 25:15.882
Aaah!
Oh... (laughs)

25:17.317 --> 25:18.919
Go! Go! Go!

25:21.121 --> 25:22.656
Guys, wait!

25:22.656 --> 25:23.890
Where is she?

25:25.325 --> 25:28.929
(Thea) I'm afraid Lena
had a terrible case
of stage fright, Ms Carré.

25:28.929 --> 25:31.798
She begged for me
to go on for her.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.900
I can't explain what happened
on the stage other than...

25:33.900 --> 25:36.036
the pressure
must have got to her.

25:36.036 --> 25:37.070
Poor thing.

25:38.404 --> 25:41.241
Yeah... She feels horrible
and is hiding in our room
just now.

25:42.576 --> 25:44.978
Would it be okay
if she spoke to you tomorrow?

25:44.978 --> 25:46.079
Fine.

25:46.079 --> 25:48.715
She better have an excellent
explanation for this.

25:51.251 --> 25:54.688
I heard she had a meltdown and
is on her way back to Russia.

25:54.688 --> 25:57.123
I heard she was
abducted by aliens.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.859
(phone rings)

26:01.862 --> 26:03.564
Hello?

26:05.766 --> 26:10.236
(sobbing) Ines?
I don't know what happened.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.254
Henri!

26:28.955 --> 26:30.023
Lena!

26:33.059 --> 26:34.360
Henri!

26:39.733 --> 26:42.969
(Lena sobbing)
He was here one minute,
and then... he was gone.

26:45.839 --> 26:47.641
I don't know what to do...

27:02.656 --> 27:05.125
