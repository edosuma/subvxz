00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
BOBBI: 'We're here today to discuss
the murder of Stella's daughter,

00:03.920 --> 00:07.720
'Maisy Tomlinson,
on the 10th of December 2018.'

00:07.760 --> 00:09.320
CHARLES: 'Hello, Stella.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.200
'I can't begin to imagine the pain
you've suffered from that night.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.000
'I wanna ask if you'll meet me.'

00:16.040 --> 00:18.880
As if we'd wanna be
anywhere near that man ever again.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.640
'Set it up.
I'll meet with Charles Stone.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.080
'I need you to tell me
why you killed my daughter.'

00:25.600 --> 00:26.920
I didn't kill her.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.200
What?

00:28.240 --> 00:30.600
'The people who set me up,
they're still out there.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.120
'Now there's another girl
from Millfields. She's missing.'

00:34.160 --> 00:35.800
Her name is Cleo Dale!
Get him off me!

00:35.840 --> 00:37.040
Cleo Dale!

00:37.080 --> 00:39.560
She's not gone missing, has she?
Did she know Maisy?

00:39.600 --> 00:41.680
Yeah, they were pals.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.760
Yeah, I'm sorting it.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.280
'I'm gonna be with you soon,
I promise.'

00:47.280 --> 00:48.840
Thanks for coming back.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.160
'I want you to tell me
about this missing girl.'

01:01.840 --> 01:04.320
'Her name is Cleo Dale.'

01:08.120 --> 01:12.040
'And what do you think
she's got to do with my daughter?'

01:14.160 --> 01:17.280
'This past three years in here,

01:17.320 --> 01:19.640
'I have had nothing but time.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.000
'Time to look for any scrap,

01:24.040 --> 01:27.840
'any explanation,
any connection to Millfields,

01:27.880 --> 01:30.560
'to your daughter, Maisy.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.280
'I think Cleo
might be that connection.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.480
'I think she's in danger.'

02:02.840 --> 02:04.920
You said you were set up.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.880
That someone sent you
to my house that night. Who?

02:15.400 --> 02:17.840
I thought this is what you wanted.
I'm here. Yeah, I know.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.240
It was the McKellers.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.840
I used to work for them.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.600
Why didn't you mention that
at the trial?

02:34.640 --> 02:36.360
You're from Millfields.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.760
You know that family,
what they're capable of.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.880
My boy still lives on that estate.
They know him.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.440
What's that got to do
with Cleo Dale?

02:47.600 --> 02:51.320
Her mum, she's an addict,
she buys off them.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.120
I know that because I sold to her.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.560
What you saying?
That they've taken her

03:01.600 --> 03:03.560
cos her mum's got a debt or summat?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.040
I don't know, but maybe.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.160
They're ruthless, Stella.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.440
They take people hostage,

03:13.480 --> 03:15.320
they torture them
until their families pay up,

03:15.360 --> 03:16.960
sometimes worse. I've seen it.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.960
Why did you run?

03:23.360 --> 03:25.120
What?
Why did you run?

03:25.160 --> 03:27.720
You're saying you're innocent,
so why did you run?

03:30.520 --> 03:33.480
Why didn't you stay
and try and save her?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.080
I did try.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.160
There was nothing that I could do.
She was already gone.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.080
Stella, no-one
would have believed me.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.040
I'd just found her like that.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.840
I had to run.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.680
What made you come back?

04:00.880 --> 04:02.280
What changed?

04:03.960 --> 04:07.160
If you know something about Cleo,
I can help.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.200
Stella...

04:48.280 --> 04:49.560
HE LAUGHS

04:49.600 --> 04:51.760
Good to be back
in the old stomping ground,

04:51.800 --> 04:53.240
i'nt it, duck?

04:54.480 --> 04:55.920
Come here.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.800
So, come on, then. What's got you
worrying about this Cleo girl, then?

05:03.960 --> 05:06.560
I went to see Charles again.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.880
What, part of that scheme?

05:08.920 --> 05:10.160
No.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.320
Then why?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.760
She was a mate of Maisy's
from the stables.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.760
My mum recognised her
from the missing person's profile.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.960
Charles thinks
that Cleo going missing

05:23.000 --> 05:24.960
is connected to Maisy somehow.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.200
He said it was the McKellers
that set him up,

05:27.240 --> 05:28.840
and he thinks
they might have taken Cleo.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.240
I don't know. I mean, maybe Cleo
knows something about the murder.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.800
No. Stop, stop, stop.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.640
Babes, you're just
clutching at straws.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.320
It's not wise,
throwing shade on that family.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.480
Is that why you wanted to come here?

05:44.520 --> 05:46.880
Do you think
they work for the McKellers?

05:46.920 --> 05:48.680
No. I don't know, could well do.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.720
Well, no-one's talking about her,
Remy. Do the police even know?

05:51.760 --> 05:53.840
Do they care?
Yeah, yeah, course.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.680
OK, then, do you know
where she's been staying? Yeah.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.840
She's staying at Riverside Lodge.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.320
I spoke to social services.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.440
Cleo's run away before.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.520
Carers are working with
the missing persons' team.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.720
They don't seem worried.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.920
'Ere y'are, look,
I've got one night off this week.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.800
That's all. Can we just at least
try and enjoy ourselves?

06:14.840 --> 06:16.680
Yeah, sorry.
Thank you.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.680
HE CRIES GENTLY

06:28.080 --> 06:29.600
Shut up.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.080
HE CRIES GENTLY

06:36.320 --> 06:37.800
All right, listen.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.120
You need to shut the fuck up,

06:40.160 --> 06:43.080
unless you want everyone in here
to hear you like this.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.240
You have no idea
what it's like in here.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.400
Hey, you wanna cry, you swallow it.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.840
You don't make a sound.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.720
KNOCKING ON DOOR

07:12.160 --> 07:13.760
DOORBELL RINGS
REPEATEDLY

07:13.800 --> 07:15.160
SHE SIGHS

07:20.080 --> 07:22.760
DOORBELL RINGS,
RAPID KNOCKING

07:22.800 --> 07:23.880
DOORBELL RINGS

07:28.680 --> 07:30.640
Hi.
Bobbi called.

07:30.680 --> 07:31.720
SHE SIGHS

07:31.760 --> 07:33.360
Wanted to check in
after your meeting.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.320
Well, come in, then.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.600
RUNNING WATER

07:48.640 --> 07:50.000
How could you meet with him?

07:52.720 --> 07:53.960
Stella?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.640
Well, I just wanted to hear from him
what really happened.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.040
Oh, and did he tell ya?

08:00.200 --> 08:02.120
Well, he said that
he's still innocent,

08:02.160 --> 08:04.400
but he did tell me that
he was working for the McKellers.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.080
Oh, Stella...
And then he told me

08:06.120 --> 08:09.000
that there's another girl missing,
who was mates with Maisy,

08:09.040 --> 08:10.600
and he thinks
that they're connected.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.960
Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.560
What the fuck is wrong with you?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.840
You're smoking too much
of that shit again, obviously.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.280
Shut up.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.520
We both know
they didn't find everything.

08:21.560 --> 08:25.360
They didn't find the phone,
they didn't find the murder weapon.

08:25.400 --> 08:29.000
Yeah, because he dumped 'em!
He knew what he was doing.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.640
How can you be so sure?

08:30.680 --> 08:32.440
There were no other suspects.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.640
And you found him with her!

08:34.680 --> 08:37.320
Yeah, I know that, but this is
new information... Stop! No!

08:37.360 --> 08:39.880
You can't ignore it.
He's got inside your head!

08:43.360 --> 08:45.000
I don't... Why?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.400
Why are you dragging
this nightmare out even longer?

08:47.440 --> 08:51.040
Because I want to know what happened
to her. No! No! This stops now!

08:52.880 --> 08:54.920
He's taken enough from us, Stella.

08:56.640 --> 08:57.920
I don't want you to speak to him,

08:57.960 --> 09:01.200
I don't want you to see to him.
Just leave him alone!

09:10.760 --> 09:14.640
Look, look, he's using ya
to try and get out.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.440
It's either that
or he's playing a sick game.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.400
Either way, he's a monster, Stella.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.720
KETTLE BOILING

09:36.760 --> 09:38.720
POURING WATER

09:49.720 --> 09:51.280
Do you want one?

09:55.400 --> 09:56.640
Yeah.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.560
POURING WATER

10:11.280 --> 10:12.880
So, what happened?

10:12.920 --> 10:14.320
What?

10:14.360 --> 10:18.360
News travels fast in this place.
We've all heard what you did.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.480
I'd fell out with my girlfriend.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.800
Went out on a bender.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.720
I were off my face.
I were driving too fast.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.720
Didn't see her
until it was too late.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.960
She were pregnant.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.680
But the only way

10:41.720 --> 10:43.960
that I'll ever be able to look at
my little girl in the eyes

10:44.000 --> 10:47.280
and ask her for a second chance
is knowing that I've done my time.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.200
I wanna be punished.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.760
This place
will do more than that to you.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.920
Let it.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.920
How else am I gonna get forgiveness?

10:58.080 --> 10:59.520
Give it time.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.840
You got plenty of that now.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.160
'I grew up on this estate.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.560
'Must have been hard here,
after everything that happened.'

11:43.600 --> 11:45.240
MAN: 'It's my home.'

11:46.720 --> 11:48.280
'I've been to see Charles.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.960
'He said he was set up.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.840
'But I read your interview.'

11:58.200 --> 12:01.120
You called him
The Millfields Monster.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.840
So you think he did it?

12:07.120 --> 12:10.560
Charles is... complicated.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.240
How do you mean?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.320
He weren't like other kids.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.240
He'd get so angry.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.960
One minute, he'd be fine,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
the next minute,
he'd completely lose it.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.120
Like he'd become a different person.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.880
Got worse...

12:34.200 --> 12:36.000
..when his mum died.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.040
He was only ten.

12:39.160 --> 12:44.200
She hadn't been well in a long time.
Took things out on Charles.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.680
She was violent?

12:47.760 --> 12:49.600
Towards Charles?

12:49.640 --> 12:51.640
She never took to him.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.120
She'd lash out.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.000
I was away with work.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.360
Do you mind me asking how she died?

13:10.320 --> 13:12.320
She did it to herself.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.760
Cut her wrists.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.840
He was the one who found her.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.000
Then a neighbour spotted him
through the window,

13:25.040 --> 13:27.040
covered in his mum's blood.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.920
After that, I always worried.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.360
But I never imagined...

13:37.160 --> 13:39.120
I'm so sorry...

13:41.320 --> 13:44.000
..for what he did to your daughter.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.680
PHONE RINGS

14:07.560 --> 14:09.240
Remy.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.120
'After what you said about Cleo,
I had a look into it.' And?

14:12.160 --> 14:15.720
'Well, a week before she
disappeared, she called the police.'

14:17.040 --> 14:18.520
What? What about?

14:19.520 --> 14:21.720
'She said she had information
she wanted to share

14:21.760 --> 14:23.960
'about Maisy's murder.'
What did she say?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.240
'Dunno. They asked her to come in,
but she never turned up.'

14:29.720 --> 14:31.360
Right, erm...

14:31.400 --> 14:33.480
Remy, where did you say
she was staying?

16:32.680 --> 16:35.520
Who are you?
What, are you her mum? No.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.280
I'm not her mum. I'm her friend.

16:38.520 --> 16:42.280
Do you live here?
Are you a mate of Cleo's?

16:44.360 --> 16:46.920
Look, I don't suppose you know
where she is, do ya?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.720
I'm kinda worried about her.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.040
No.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.800
Do you know where her mum lives?
Just so I can get in touch.

16:52.840 --> 16:57.880
Nah. Look, I didn't really
know her that well, so....

17:09.360 --> 17:12.520
CHARLES: 'Her mum...
she's an addict,

17:12.560 --> 17:14.160
'and she buys off them.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.800
'And I know that
because I used to sell it to her.'

17:23.040 --> 17:24.640
Oh, come on, Jess.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.920
Oh, ain't he gorgeous, Stella?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.760
Kelvin's nephew's
usually the carver.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.480
He's off sick with a dicky tummy,
or you'd have met him.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.920
Sounds like that's best
for everybody involved.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.880
He's got curls like a lamb.
Dead hunky.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.760
But he's going through
a messy divorce... Mum, just...

17:39.800 --> 17:42.560
I'm just putting it out there
for when he's back on the market.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.960
You got kids, then, Kelvin?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.440
Er, no.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.560
Er, been a stepdad
a fair few times, though.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.920
I bet they've loved coming to
the stables over the years.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.200
Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.920
Do you, erm,
keep the girls' addresses on file?

18:05.560 --> 18:07.600
Er, no, love, I don't, no.

18:08.640 --> 18:12.000
You must do, I mean,
just in case there's an accident.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.000
You must have to keep it
for next of kin.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.560
You can't delete...
Stella!

18:17.120 --> 18:18.280
That's enough.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.240
You couldn't just have a nice meal
with Kelvin

18:21.280 --> 18:24.760
and make it all about him, could ya?
You've got it right on you today.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.600
I'd have told ya
if you'd just asked.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.520
Told me what?
I know what you want.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.440
SHE SIGHS
I know where Cleo's mam lives.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.040
I'm just gonna use the lav, love,
all right?

18:44.080 --> 18:45.600
Tell me, then.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.480
I'm worried about you, duckie.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.360
I don't want to encourage
this erratic behaviour.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.560
Just tell me.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.440
Well, I will.
I just want my dinner first.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.680
DOG BARKS INSIDE

19:10.840 --> 19:13.840

19:13.880 --> 19:16.720
Yeah?
It's Cleo's mum, innit?

19:16.760 --> 19:18.560
Yeah, what about it?
BARKING CONTINUES

19:18.600 --> 19:20.280
I'm looking for her.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.840
What's she done?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.320
Nothing.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.120
She's missing.

She'll be back when it suits her.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.080
'Get rid of her!'

19:40.120 --> 19:43.000
Cleo knew something
about the Maisy Tomlinson murder.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.880
Did she ever say anything to you
about it?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.440
I know you.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.480
You're not from the social.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.160
You're her mum.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.160
And you come round here, telling me
how to look after my daughter?

20:06.200 --> 20:08.160
Who was looking after yours, eh?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.960
I'm only trying to help.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.240
That's my number.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.600

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I went to see your dad.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.480
Did he apologise for me?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.480
He told me about your mum.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.440
He told me that you were the one
who found her.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.920
It wasn't her fault.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.520
Not really. I can see that now.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.160
She was ill.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.600
But my dad, he ignored things.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.800
He saw the bruises,
he heard the things she called me.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.160
He never said a word.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.800
And then after she died, he just
never looked at me the same again.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.200
You said your son
lives in Millfields, too.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.960
Are they close?

21:46.800 --> 21:49.720
Yeah, Teddy's leaned on him a bit
these past few years.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.320
Does he believe you?

21:52.360 --> 21:53.600
Teddy?

21:53.640 --> 21:54.840
Yeah.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.600

22:38.640 --> 22:40.440

22:53.600 --> 22:56.120
You OK with me asking you questions
about your dad?

22:56.160 --> 22:59.000
Yeah, yeah, course.
It's the least I can do.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.160
Was he popular round here?

23:04.200 --> 23:06.720
Yeah, erm, he was a whirlwind.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.520
You know,
whenever he was out of prison,

23:08.560 --> 23:09.880
it was just chaos.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.240
Drinking, partying.
People kinda gravitated towards him.

23:17.760 --> 23:21.240
I don't suppose you have any trouble
with the McKellers nowadays, do ya?

23:22.760 --> 23:25.320
No. I ain't got owt
to do with them.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.600
Not since he went down.
I've stayed well clear.

23:28.800 --> 23:33.040
Erm, you know, erm, my dad,
he's never mentioned the McKellers

23:33.080 --> 23:34.680
in connection with anything.

about my dad.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.880
Er, this is Grace.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.800
Charles told us about your, er,
meeting with him.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.720
Thanks for...

23:59.000 --> 24:02.040
I dunno, it must take a lot to...

24:04.280 --> 24:07.320
Just trying to find out a bit more
about what happened.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.840
That's no bad thing.

I'm gonna pop the kettle on.

All right, thanks, love.
I'll leave you two to it.

When I spoke to your grandad...

24:29.440 --> 24:32.600
Well, he believes
that your dad did do it.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.920
Do you?

24:40.080 --> 24:41.880
What do you want me to say?

CHARLES: 'So, Stella...'

24:58.880 --> 25:00.520
..what was she asking?

25:00.560 --> 25:03.440
Just everything
that you said she would.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.720
And what did you say?

25:06.800 --> 25:08.480
Everything you told me to.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.840
Look, Dad, you know I support you,
don't ya?

25:12.880 --> 25:14.640
Yeah, I do. Listen to me.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.720
My hands are tied in here.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.160
You're my eyes and my ears
out there.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.680
Do you hear me?

25:25.840 --> 25:28.440
I love you. I'm relying on you.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.520
I just don't want the McKellers
getting involved.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.480
Don't worry about the McKellers.
Of course I'm worried about it.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.720
I've got it under control.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.360
Yeah, I've heard that before.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.880
Just be careful.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.280
Whatever your plans are,
please don't forget us in it.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.480

I've got it under control.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.560
All right.

Go on, just say it.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.240

26:05.280 --> 26:06.840
Why?

26:08.120 --> 26:09.720
Cos he's dying.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.040
Look, I want you
to meet with him, Dad.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.840
Will you let him come, please?

26:20.120 --> 26:21.440
Dad?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.240
No.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.760
Dad, just think...
I said no.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.440
I'm sick of this.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.320
It's gonna be me
picking up the pieces

26:35.360 --> 26:38.000
if you leave it too late.
Grandad dies, and you haven't...

26:38.040 --> 26:41.160
Who do you think
you're fucking talking to?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.960
I'll smack you
across the fucking face.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.400
I'm your father.
You show me some respect.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.120
I said no.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.800

Because you chose him.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.600
I'm sorry.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.400
I was an idiot.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.760
We were just kids, Remy.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.520
I know, but...

29:21.760 --> 29:25.760
..I thought that you thought
that Paul was, I dunno...

29:28.000 --> 29:29.720
..better than me.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.840
Dunno why.
He's a right arrogant prick.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.720
Thinks his coke habit's OK

29:38.760 --> 29:40.560
because he does coke
in a dinner party

29:40.600 --> 29:42.320
rather than in a pub toilet.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.280
Well, he did knock that on the head
when I got pregnant.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.920
What?

29:54.240 --> 29:57.040
Well, I caught him picking up
not that long back. Did ya?

29:57.080 --> 29:58.440
When?

29:58.480 --> 29:59.680
Oh, forget I said it.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.880
I mean, I didn't say anything
cos, you know,

30:01.920 --> 30:05.920
you and Maisy and that,
but he's always been a cokehead.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.840
Right, so where did he pick up from?

30:10.160 --> 30:12.520
It's not really...
It was the McKellers, wasn't it?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.440
Everyone's shifting coke
in Notts these days.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.880
You what I mean?
And, yeah, of course,

30:16.920 --> 30:18.760
most of it
goes through the McKellers first.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.640
I've been
learning some things tonight,

30:38.680 --> 30:40.600
about you buying drugs
off the McKellers.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.320
Remy told me everything.
About what?

30:43.360 --> 30:46.800
About your coke habit.
About him catching ya.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.400

30:54.640 --> 30:56.720
Charles was working for
the McKellers.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.640
He was sent to our house that night.

30:58.680 --> 31:01.400
And now I find out that you've been
buying drugs off them?

31:01.440 --> 31:05.440
I picked up off a kid in the street.
I didn't even know he was a McKeller

31:05.480 --> 31:07.240
until the fucking super cop
turned up.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.120
Well, you can't be messing with
these people.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.600
So, what, did you owe them money
or summat?

31:11.640 --> 31:13.400
What are you suggesting?

31:13.440 --> 31:16.320
Ah, you know what,
I'm not even entertaining this.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.360
Is that why
you didn't want me seeing Charles?

31:18.400 --> 31:19.800
Because you're hiding something?

31:25.440 --> 31:27.000
You really wanna go there?

31:28.320 --> 31:30.360
You'll really throw shit
at anyone else, won't ya,

31:30.400 --> 31:31.560
to try and escape the truth?

31:33.760 --> 31:35.680
You were two minutes up the road,

31:35.720 --> 31:36.960
getting pissed,

31:37.000 --> 31:40.280
rather than being at home with Maisy
that night.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.720
You're a fucking liar.
I'll find out the truth, Paul.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.320
Best out of three?

32:06.360 --> 32:07.640
Go on, then.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.320
We could put a bit of a wager on it,
make it a bit more interesting.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.520
Nah, nah, nah. That's a mug's game.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.120
Come on, man. Some of the others do.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.760
That lot invited you to play?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.920
Yeah.
Listen.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.880
You get into debt in here,

32:21.920 --> 32:24.760
even for a few bits
from the canteen, you're done.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.800
Right? You're done.
Leave all that lot well alone.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.640
DOOR LOCK BUZZES

32:32.680 --> 32:33.920
MAN: Is that Karl McKeller?

32:33.960 --> 32:35.320
MAN: That is him, innit?

32:35.360 --> 32:37.400
MAN: It's Karl McKeller.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.560
All right, Charlie?

32:42.600 --> 32:43.960
All right, Karl?

32:47.240 --> 32:48.600
Who's that?

32:50.040 --> 32:51.760
It's Karl McKeller.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.520
A McKeller?

32:54.760 --> 32:59.200
Why would they put him on this wing?
Who's he need protecting from?

33:00.360 --> 33:01.880
That's not why he's here.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.760
DOOR OPENS

33:41.720 --> 33:44.480
How you doing, then?
Yeah, I'm all right.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.520
You been behaving yourself?

33:47.560 --> 33:49.360
I'm keeping my head down.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.800
Keeping busy with visitors,
more like.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.240
Listen...

33:57.400 --> 33:59.040
..I don't wanna be here...

34:00.320 --> 34:03.760
..with the nonces, and the rapists,

34:03.800 --> 34:05.760
and the child killers,

34:05.800 --> 34:07.720
any more than I need to be.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.800
Now, I hope for both
of our sakes, Charlie...

34:13.880 --> 34:15.560
..that you'll stop talking...

34:16.720 --> 34:19.600
..and then I'll be
out of here again soon.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.280
DOOR OPENS

34:35.120 --> 34:36.440
DOOR CLOSES

34:44.000 --> 34:47.760
I know I'm your mum, and I'm meant
to be just on your side...

34:47.800 --> 34:49.840
Well, then, try it for a change.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.200
But how you've been accusing Paul

34:51.240 --> 34:54.200
of having anything to do
with our Maisy's murder

34:54.240 --> 34:55.880
is just beyond me.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.560
What world are you living in, gal?

34:58.600 --> 35:00.680
I actually think
there might be some truth

35:00.720 --> 35:02.320
in what Charles is saying.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.120
You're not choosing to believe him
over Paul?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.920
I've always just let you be,

35:07.960 --> 35:11.080
because it was a terrible,
terrible thing what happened...

35:12.560 --> 35:15.680
..but Paul lost his girl as well
that night.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.320
I think, sometimes, you forget that.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.480
'I'm sorry for showing up
like this.'

35:28.520 --> 35:30.920
MEERA: It's fine.
Paul'll be back soon.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.040
'I'm... questioning everything.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.200
'Completely paranoid.'

35:38.240 --> 35:42.320
To be honest, Meera,
I'm losing my fucking mind.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.360
I knew summat was up with Paul
before Maisy died.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.600
He was just acting odd,

35:50.640 --> 35:53.720
shady with his phone,
he was late home.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.880
And now I know that he had dealings
with the McKellers.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.440
Paul might not even know.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.480
What if they tried to take Maisy
that night

36:00.520 --> 36:02.240
to get money out of him?
Stella...

36:02.280 --> 36:04.240
This has to be why
they were targeting our house.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.560
Stella, stop.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.840
You're so far off.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.000
Paul was with me that night.

36:15.920 --> 36:19.880
We'd already started...
a relationship.

36:23.200 --> 36:27.400
I was at the hotel when you called
to tell him that Maisy'd died.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.720
We're about to start a family.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.400
I don't want any more lies.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.160
FRONT DOOR OPENS

36:39.600 --> 36:41.360
DOOR CLOSES

36:46.160 --> 36:47.720
Stella, what, erm...

36:47.760 --> 36:50.960
Stella was getting...
Well, thinking all sorts.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.560
I had to tell her about us.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.040
I'm so sorry.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.960
You let me believe
that I was the only one

36:57.000 --> 36:59.120
that let Maisy down that night.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.000
How could I tell ya?
Our daughter had just died.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.240
I was calling you for hours, Paul,
and now I find out

37:05.280 --> 37:07.000
that you were shagging your boss?

37:07.040 --> 37:09.880
You were hardly perfect either,
Stella. I never pretended to be.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.920
But it all makes sense now,
don't it?

37:11.960 --> 37:14.240
How you was able
to stay living in this house,

37:14.280 --> 37:16.560
how you moved on so quick.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.240
It still weren't enough, was it?
After we were fucking there

37:19.280 --> 37:21.080
only two weeks ago.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.080
FRONT DOOR SLAMS

37:25.120 --> 37:26.680
Ah, fuck!

37:34.120 --> 37:36.360
So, did your girlfriend visit
this morning?

37:37.600 --> 37:40.240
Yeah. Must have took a lot
for her to come in.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.960
First visit's always the toughest.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.240
Yeah.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.280
Have you decided what to do
about your dad?

37:48.640 --> 37:50.480
You might not get
another chance, man.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.760
JAIL DOOR SLAMS

38:07.800 --> 38:09.080
HE CRIES

38:09.120 --> 38:10.880
'He told me about your mum.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.920
'Get out! Get out!

38:12.960 --> 38:15.000
'He told me that you were the one
who found her.'

38:15.040 --> 38:18.040
STELLA CRYING

38:20.360 --> 38:22.480
CRYING ECHOES

38:33.560 --> 38:35.600
DOOR LOCK BUZZES

38:50.240 --> 38:51.760
Can I...?

38:51.800 --> 38:53.000
Yeah.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.520
HE GROANS

39:01.080 --> 39:05.000
You all right? I'll see
if they can get you a cushion.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.960
I'll manage.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.280
I just tried not to take
so many meds today.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.200
They make my mind a bit fuzzy, like.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.920
I've not got long.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.640
Weeks now, not even months.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.520
Did Teddy tell you?

39:28.560 --> 39:29.800
Yeah.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.760
I'm sorry.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.480
It's always a tonic, seeing him.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.160
Yeah, he does me proud.

39:42.760 --> 39:46.080
Stella Tomlinson came to see me.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.720
She deserves to know the truth.

39:59.160 --> 40:02.640
I need you to take responsibility

40:02.680 --> 40:05.080
for what you did to that girl.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.720
Please.
That the only reason you came?

40:08.760 --> 40:11.240
Charles, please.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.680
I know I let you down.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.160
Yeah, you did.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.680
Should have done better by you
with your mum.

40:17.720 --> 40:22.240
But I just need to hear you say it.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.960
You've got that in you,
haven't you, son?

40:27.440 --> 40:30.080
Admit to me

40:30.120 --> 40:33.960
that you killed Maisy Tomlinson.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.960
You know,
you broke my fucking heart.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.440
I love you, Dad.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.680
Bye.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.480
How'd it go? What did your dad say?

41:23.520 --> 41:25.880
What happened? Charles?

41:25.920 --> 41:27.640
Shut your fucking mouth!

41:27.680 --> 41:30.560
Do you hear me? Keep your nose
out of my fucking business!

41:30.600 --> 41:31.640
Sorry, mate, I was just...

41:31.680 --> 41:33.720
You're not my fucking mate!
Get that into your head!

41:33.760 --> 41:35.200
You're not my fucking mate!

41:38.000 --> 41:39.560
You're a fucking child killer!

41:42.160 --> 41:45.520
You're nothing like me!
Nothing like me!

42:02.760 --> 42:05.760
Thanks for meeting.
Yeah, it's no trouble.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.360
I wanted to talk to you.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.800
What I said
about your daughter, I...

42:10.840 --> 42:12.800
It's OK, honestly.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.640
No, it's not.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.440
I'm sorry, all right?

42:19.720 --> 42:22.200
What that man
did to your daughter, I...

42:23.400 --> 42:25.000
You knew Charles, then?

42:25.040 --> 42:28.160
I wouldn't say knew him,
but he sold to me, yeah.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.720
Always thought he was a scumbag,
but when I heard what he did...

42:35.440 --> 42:36.800
I just...

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I dunno how you do it, love.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.280
Get out of bed every morning.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.960
Sometimes, I don't.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.600
Look, we all make mistakes.
I'm not here to judge ya.

42:56.960 --> 43:00.000
I'm guessing you didn't call
just to apologise.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.080
I've still got this.

43:03.960 --> 43:07.120
Cleo's tablet. I've unlocked it.

43:07.160 --> 43:12.000
I thought it might help you,
you know, in looking for her?

43:15.080 --> 43:17.920
Do you have any clue
where she might be?

43:18.960 --> 43:20.880
I don't know.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.600
But I hope she's OK.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.240
She's my baby.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.800
It's nice... that someone cares.

43:36.480 --> 43:37.960
Thank you.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.800
PHONE VIBRATES

43:44.960 --> 43:47.800
I'd best be, you know...
Yeah.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.640
..getting back.
Thanks for that.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.520
It's all right.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.720
He'll be on me all day if I don't.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.120
See ya.

What are you doing?
