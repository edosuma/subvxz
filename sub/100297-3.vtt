WEBVTT

00:04.924 --> 00:06.627
Well, it’s to you, Mike.

00:06.627 --> 00:08.825
Oh, you can bid a double, but if
it’s followed by three passes,

00:08.825 --> 00:10.297
it’s a penalty double.

00:10.297 --> 00:11.792
Right?

00:11.792 --> 00:13.792
This is very complicated.

00:13.792 --> 00:16.330
Can’t we play something
less complicated than bridge?

00:16.330 --> 00:17.957
Like, why don’t we build
a bridge?

00:17.957 --> 00:19.957
-Huh?
-Yeah.

00:19.957 --> 00:22.099
Oh, I got it.
Who’s got any threes?

00:22.099 --> 00:23.429
Oh, I do, I got a three.

00:23.429 --> 00:26.759
This ain’t Go Fish, Mike.

00:26.759 --> 00:28.495
This is a nightmare.

00:28.495 --> 00:31.759
I have a straight,
a flush, and blackjack.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.429
Hey, you know, Mike’s right.

00:34.429 --> 00:36.132
This really is
a complicated game.

00:36.132 --> 00:38.363
It’s dignified.

00:38.363 --> 00:40.132
You know, in the workshop
Eddie and I took,

00:40.132 --> 00:41.957
they taught us
you never play for money

00:41.957 --> 00:43.495
or to show how smart you are

00:43.495 --> 00:45.957
or how stupid
your opponents are.

00:45.957 --> 00:47.825
That’s the only reason
I play anything.

00:48.825 --> 00:52.297
Oh, come on, this is fun.

00:52.297 --> 00:54.297
Bridge is about partnership.

00:54.297 --> 00:56.627
And I have the best partner
in the world.

00:56.627 --> 01:00.165
(gasps)
Oh, ooh. Ah.

01:00.165 --> 01:02.792
Yeah. Who knew bridge
was so romantic?

01:02.792 --> 01:04.132
(chuckles)

01:04.132 --> 01:07.429
You know what’s romantic?
Solitaire.

01:07.429 --> 01:10.462
Oh... Mike, Mike,

01:10.462 --> 01:14.198
you would enjoy bridge more
if you took the workshop.

01:14.198 --> 01:16.858
Oh, oh, and if you say
that we recommended you,

01:16.858 --> 01:18.627
we get a free pinochle lesson.

01:18.627 --> 01:20.759
You know, Mom,
I think it’s great

01:20.759 --> 01:22.627
that you and Ed are taking up
all these new hobbies.

01:22.627 --> 01:23.759
You’re so active.

01:23.759 --> 01:27.858
It’s, it’s like that fun montage
in Cocoon.

01:27.858 --> 01:30.693
Wow. Are you saying
these two people are old?

01:30.693 --> 01:34.627
Hear that?!
She’s calling you two old!

01:34.627 --> 01:36.660
Old and maybe too tired

01:36.660 --> 01:39.759
to finish this stupid game!

01:39.759 --> 01:43.825
Ooh, my super wifey sense
is tingling. (chuckles)

01:43.825 --> 01:46.792
It’s telling me Mike is ready
to call it a night.

01:46.792 --> 01:49.924
Yeah, because Mike Baxter
is so hard to read.

01:49.924 --> 01:52.363
You know, it’s great being
around people who get me.

01:52.363 --> 01:55.000
I feel seen.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.066
♪ ♪

02:01.825 --> 02:04.033
(door closes)

02:14.858 --> 02:18.165
All right, did you lose
something, like your mind?

02:18.165 --> 02:21.429
I was just looking.
Is Ed here?

02:21.429 --> 02:23.132
I mean, he could be here
and we don’t know it.

02:23.132 --> 02:24.264
They love playing games.

02:24.264 --> 02:25.693
Maybe they’re playing
hide-and-seek.

02:25.693 --> 02:29.297
Relax. They’re out
taking a cooking class.

02:29.297 --> 02:32.858
Ed’s exact words were,
"For once we’re going to sizzle

02:32.858 --> 02:34.594
outside the bedroom."

02:34.594 --> 02:37.099
(Mike gagging)

02:37.099 --> 02:39.033
Oh, come on,
I think they’re adorable.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.363
Yeah, adorable,

02:40.363 --> 02:42.594
but they’re spending way
too much time with us.

02:42.594 --> 02:46.033
I want to spend more time
with my favorite person.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.858
Yourself.

02:47.858 --> 02:50.264
Once again,

02:50.264 --> 02:53.297
I feel... seen.

02:53.297 --> 02:56.198
Yeah, you’re kind of
hard to miss.

02:56.198 --> 02:58.000
Look, honey, you’re right,
you’re right.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.033
We have been doing a lot
of stuff with them lately,

03:00.033 --> 03:02.165
and you have been
really great about it.

03:02.165 --> 03:05.495
I don’t know if great’s
the right word.

03:05.495 --> 03:07.462
Generous.

03:07.462 --> 03:09.924
Heroic.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.792
The next time
they ask us to do something,

03:11.792 --> 03:13.792
I’m just going to say no.

03:13.792 --> 03:16.297
Since you need your "me time,"
let me be your hero.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.198
You look great in tights.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.693
(Bonnie laughing)

03:19.693 --> 03:22.198
(Ed and Bonnie speaking
indistinctly)

03:22.198 --> 03:23.858
Hi. How was cooking class?

03:23.858 --> 03:25.330
Oh, it was delightful.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.594
We made polenta Parmesan puffs.

03:27.594 --> 03:29.000
Just tell ’em what you said.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.429
-Tell ’em-- go ahead, go ahead.
-Oh, oh, oh.

03:30.429 --> 03:32.759
-So, Eddie was trying
to steal my Parmesan.
-Yep.

03:32.759 --> 03:33.924
So I said...

03:33.924 --> 03:36.363
She said, "That’s nacho cheese."

03:38.297 --> 03:41.363
Ah, that’s nacho best pun.

03:41.363 --> 03:43.627
Oh, good.
Oh, oh, oh, before I forget,

03:43.627 --> 03:45.462
there’s another cooking class
tomorrow night,

03:45.462 --> 03:47.462
-and I have a coupon...
-No, Mom?

03:47.462 --> 03:49.198
No, no, you know what,
I think, uh,

03:49.198 --> 03:51.198
we’re gonna take a break from
the double dates for a while.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.330
Actually, guys,

03:53.330 --> 03:56.693
this coupon is
just for the two of you.

03:56.693 --> 03:58.627
Eddie and I enjoyed
the cooking class so much,

03:58.627 --> 03:59.858
we just thought
you might, too.

03:59.858 --> 04:01.198
Got to take a hard pass on that.

04:01.198 --> 04:03.132
I’ve got, uh, some stuff
I’ve got to do

04:03.132 --> 04:04.363
in the garage tomorrow night.

04:04.363 --> 04:06.858
Yeah, y-yeah, you know,
since Mike enjoys his "me time,"

04:06.858 --> 04:08.297
just like Dad used to, um,

04:08.297 --> 04:10.924
maybe-maybe I’ll take the class.

04:10.924 --> 04:13.330
-Oh. By yourself?
-Yeah.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.330
Yeah, yeah, sure, we do
lots of stuff separately.

04:15.330 --> 04:18.462
Well, have fun, honey.
I’m gonna be, um...

04:18.462 --> 04:20.462
tying flies.

04:20.462 --> 04:23.000
Fly fishing season’s
right around the corner. Yeah.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.132
Not for ten weeks.

04:24.132 --> 04:27.396
Well, a bridge game away.

04:32.495 --> 04:34.528
-Hey.
-Hey, what’s up?

04:34.528 --> 04:36.198
Uh, I thought Ryan was here.
He’s supposed to install

04:36.198 --> 04:37.792
this garbage disposal
for you guys.

04:37.792 --> 04:39.000
Oh, thank God.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.627
It’s a nightmare
not having one.

04:40.627 --> 04:42.099
We almost bought a goat.

04:45.627 --> 04:47.495
(gasps)
There’s my honey.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.957
Hello, beautiful.

04:48.957 --> 04:52.627
Sorry if that sounded mean.

04:52.627 --> 04:54.693
I’m just kind of upset.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.297
What’s wrong?

04:56.297 --> 04:58.594
What’s wrong?
Haven’t you heard?

04:58.594 --> 05:00.132
Bill Lamp died.

05:00.132 --> 05:02.924
Bill Lamp? Oh, no.

05:02.924 --> 05:05.462
But he was the number one
Pontiac dealer

05:05.462 --> 05:08.099
in Central Alabama.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.297
Bill Lamp is the creator
of Toxic Titans,

05:11.297 --> 05:13.759
the greatest graphic novel
series ever written.

05:13.759 --> 05:15.858
I’m not sure
I’m familiar with...

05:15.858 --> 05:18.198
Asteroid Girl, Fire Falcon,
Doctor Calamity?

05:18.198 --> 05:19.528
How can you not know Bill Lamp?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.528
Because we don’t drive
a Pontiac.

05:24.528 --> 05:25.792
How old was he?

05:25.792 --> 05:27.429
Ninety-six.

05:27.429 --> 05:30.198
And he would have been
97 next month.

05:30.198 --> 05:33.363
-You know, I can’t install
a garbage disposal right now.
-Of course, honey.

05:33.363 --> 05:34.660
You need time
to get over the shock

05:34.660 --> 05:37.000
of a 97-year-old man dying.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.627
Uh, we should go.

05:39.627 --> 05:41.528
We’re getting together with
some other fans of Bill Lamp.

05:41.528 --> 05:44.528
Yeah, we’re meeting
over at Ronnie’s house.

05:44.528 --> 05:47.759
His mom’s out of town,
so we get to use the rec room.

05:47.759 --> 05:50.660
Is there gonna be a parent there
to watch you kids?

05:50.660 --> 05:54.033
As Fire Falcon would say,

05:54.033 --> 05:57.363
"Ick-lack-fabba-doo-wonk.
Ca-caw!"

05:58.792 --> 06:02.000
That’s falcon for,
"Sleep tight, my captain.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.858
The lamp has gone out."

06:14.330 --> 06:16.627
Yoo-hoo!

06:16.627 --> 06:20.924
Oh, boy, you and Ed
taking up yodeling now?

06:20.924 --> 06:23.330
On our list.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.132
If you’re looking for Vanessa,

06:25.132 --> 06:27.462
she’s not back
from that cooking class yet.

06:27.462 --> 06:29.660
No, I was just lonely in there.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.792
It’s just so different nowadays,

06:31.792 --> 06:35.165
staying here without
all the kids running around.

06:35.165 --> 06:37.759
You know, I even like
staying here now.

06:37.759 --> 06:39.198
(laughs)

06:39.198 --> 06:43.858
You know, it reminds me of...
of when my girls left home,

06:43.858 --> 06:46.792
and it was just me
and, and Vanessa’s father.

06:46.792 --> 06:50.528
I was surprised at
how difficult that was for us.

06:50.528 --> 06:52.858
You seemed all right every time
I was there,

06:52.858 --> 06:56.528
but I probably wasn’t
paying attention.

06:56.528 --> 07:01.495
I-It’s not like we were fighting
or-or anything, it just...

07:01.495 --> 07:03.759
We just sort of drifted apart.

07:03.759 --> 07:05.792
Well, how did you guys fix that?

07:05.792 --> 07:09.099
We didn’t. He died.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.363
Well, lucky break.

07:11.363 --> 07:14.297
Oh... Michael.

07:14.297 --> 07:17.264
Michael.

07:17.264 --> 07:19.627
I would just hate to see
the same thing happen

07:19.627 --> 07:21.330
to you and Vanessa.

07:21.330 --> 07:24.693
Bonnie... Bonnie.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.858
We’re okay.

07:28.858 --> 07:31.792
It’s just that you like doing
different things,

07:31.792 --> 07:35.264
which was fine when the girls
were still home.

07:35.264 --> 07:37.594
They bound you together.

07:37.594 --> 07:41.660
But now that’s changed,
and-and if you’re not careful,

07:41.660 --> 07:45.033
you could find yourselves
on, uh, different tracks.

07:45.033 --> 07:46.627
VANESSA:
Oh, h-h-h-hey.

07:46.627 --> 07:48.660
Buona sera.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.099
-Oh.
-Hi.

07:50.099 --> 07:52.627
What, are you making
Japanese food?

07:52.627 --> 07:55.000
Authentic veal scaloppini.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.924
And you know what,
it turns out they have classes

07:56.924 --> 07:58.198
in all kinds of stuff.

07:58.198 --> 08:00.363
In fact, I’m gonna take
a wine-tasting class

08:00.363 --> 08:01.627
-tomorrow night.
-Ooh.

08:01.627 --> 08:02.627
I don’t know, honey, you know,

08:02.627 --> 08:04.462
they make you spit it out.

08:04.462 --> 08:06.033
You hear that, Mike?

08:06.033 --> 08:08.528
Vanessa’s taking
more classes, so...

08:08.528 --> 08:10.198
(chuckles weakly)
Yeah.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.264
Uh, you know what, let’s, uh,
let’s leave Mike alone.

08:12.264 --> 08:14.363
Um, come on with me,
I will heat up

08:14.363 --> 08:17.858
-some of the scaloppini for you.
-Ooh, I would love a taste.

08:17.858 --> 08:19.462
You know, doesn’t he
remind you of Dad

08:19.462 --> 08:21.792
down in the basement
tinkering with his clocks?

08:21.792 --> 08:25.693
Yes... he does.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.165
This is good stuff, man.

08:37.165 --> 08:38.825
Shoplifting is way,
way down, man.

08:38.825 --> 08:40.528
And, uh, good job.

08:40.528 --> 08:43.000
Dear Diary,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.363
today Baxter paid me
a compliment.

08:46.363 --> 08:50.066
Dear Journal, Chuck has a diary.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.297
Hey, Ed asked me and Carol to
play bridge with him and Bonnie.

08:55.297 --> 08:57.429
Well, I’ll see you
in about a week.

08:59.165 --> 09:00.660
Make sure that’s
the only game they’re playing.

09:00.660 --> 09:03.264
Lately Bonnie wants
to play marriage counselor.

09:03.264 --> 09:04.759
Well, that doesn’t sound
very fun.

09:04.759 --> 09:06.198
It’s not very fun.

09:06.198 --> 09:08.363
She gave me the whole spiel
about how Vanessa and I

09:08.363 --> 09:10.528
may drift apart
now that the girls are gone.

09:10.528 --> 09:12.297
-Right?
-Oh, well,

09:12.297 --> 09:15.132
you know, when Brandon went off
to college... (chuckles)

09:15.132 --> 09:17.099
it was a big adjustment
for Carol and me.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.495
Is that when you started
the diary?

09:22.528 --> 09:24.858
No, we, we realized
after a while

09:24.858 --> 09:26.660
that we were drifting apart.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.924
So we decided
to take an interest

09:28.924 --> 09:30.528
in each other’s hobbies.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.297
That’s how I started gardening
with Carol.

09:33.297 --> 09:34.660
That’s a terrible hobby.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.495
You do all that work,
you end up with what?

09:36.495 --> 09:38.297
A bunch of vegetables.

09:38.297 --> 09:41.528
No, no, see,
when I do it with Carol,

09:41.528 --> 09:43.462
I actually like gardening.

09:43.462 --> 09:45.627
What hobby of yours
did she pick up?

09:45.627 --> 09:46.693
Zumba.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.858
(deep voice):
Shut up.

09:55.330 --> 10:00.198
So maybe all this me time
isn’t, uh, good for us.

10:00.198 --> 10:02.462
Well, all I’m saying is,
I didn’t want to take

10:02.462 --> 10:04.693
any chances with my marriage.

10:04.693 --> 10:06.660
Mm-hmm.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.924
Well, I appreciate
the man-to-man,

10:08.924 --> 10:10.693
but you got to run,
do your gardening,

10:10.693 --> 10:12.891
and get your diary,
go on to your Zumba classes...

10:19.660 --> 10:21.627
Oh, okay, how about this?

10:21.627 --> 10:24.495
What if the scene where Lord
Evilian lowers Fire Falcon

10:24.495 --> 10:26.264
into the Hemick-ulite happens...

10:26.264 --> 10:28.363
After Asteroid Girl escapes
from the Stink Lava.

10:28.363 --> 10:30.033
Well, yeah, I love it.

10:30.033 --> 10:32.528
Man, we’re really good at this.

10:32.528 --> 10:34.891
It’s like Bill Lamp is with us.

10:35.825 --> 10:38.858
Maybe he is, Kyle, maybe he is.

10:42.693 --> 10:45.132
(gasps)
Yay, the manager’s here.

10:45.132 --> 10:46.825
I can’t wait to grind garbage.

10:46.825 --> 10:48.660
Oh, right.
W-We didn’t do that.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.462
Uh, babe,
you’ve been here all day.

10:50.462 --> 10:51.693
What have you been doing?

10:51.693 --> 10:54.660
Something way more important.
We decided to finish

10:54.660 --> 10:57.099
the Train of Doom series
ourselves.

10:57.099 --> 11:00.033
Yeah. We don’t have legal rights
or even permission,

11:00.033 --> 11:01.462
but we’ll work that out later.

11:01.462 --> 11:03.495
What do you guys think?

11:03.495 --> 11:07.099
Yeah, the-the pictures aren’t
great, but the story is tight.

11:07.099 --> 11:10.429
I’m glad that you’re
so passionate about this, Ryan,

11:10.429 --> 11:12.528
but you’re the manager
and you said that you would...

11:12.528 --> 11:15.132
What is wrong
with that guy’s nose?

11:15.132 --> 11:19.363
It’s a beak. He’s Fire Falcon,
half-man, half-bird.

11:19.363 --> 11:21.264
Ca-caw!

11:22.462 --> 11:24.363
Uh, why is he throwing up?

11:24.363 --> 11:26.594
(scoffs)
It’s fire.

11:26.594 --> 11:28.924
(both chuckle)

11:28.924 --> 11:33.363
Okay, it’s a little childish.

11:33.363 --> 11:34.957
We get you love your comics...

11:34.957 --> 11:37.693
BOTH:
Graphic novels.

11:37.693 --> 11:39.132
Whatever.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.957
Uh, but you know what would
make you actual superheroes?

11:41.957 --> 11:45.726
Installing the garbage disposal.
Ca-caw.

11:51.858 --> 11:53.297
Hey, babe.

11:53.297 --> 11:56.924
Mike. Uh...

11:56.924 --> 11:59.660
Look, wine tasting.
You know what’s kind of funny?

11:59.660 --> 12:01.792
-This is right next
to an AA meeting.
-Yeah.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.792
Uh, but what-what
are you doing here?

12:03.792 --> 12:06.165
-(stammers) Was everything okay?
Did somebody die?
-No, no, no, no.

12:06.165 --> 12:09.198
Well, according to Kyle,
the guy that invented the lamp.

12:09.198 --> 12:11.264
Okay.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.495
I’m here into this
because I’m into you.

12:14.495 --> 12:18.330
All right, well, well,
that’s sweet. (chuckles)

12:18.330 --> 12:21.693
Look, you mess this class up
for me, and I will kill you.

12:21.693 --> 12:23.297
Oh.

12:23.297 --> 12:24.693
Isn’t that nice?

12:24.693 --> 12:26.132
I do something nice for you,

12:26.132 --> 12:29.924
and you kick me
right in the pinot grigios.

12:37.462 --> 12:40.000
Hold the glass by the stem

12:40.000 --> 12:41.924
and give it a good swirl,

12:41.924 --> 12:45.825
so that you can fully observe
the wine’s personality.

12:45.825 --> 12:48.627
Look at that,
our wine has a personality.

12:48.627 --> 12:51.000
Unfortunately,
our teacher does not.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.330
No, I think he’s just trying
to get us to appreciate the wine

12:54.330 --> 12:55.759
before we sip it.

12:55.759 --> 12:58.165
It’s like, uh,
the foreplay for drinking.

12:58.165 --> 13:00.231
Drinking is foreplay.

13:01.924 --> 13:05.528
Watch how the wine slides down
the glass. See the lines?

13:05.528 --> 13:09.000
-Those are the legs of the wine.
-Ah.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.429
The legs,
that’s where it gets its kick.

13:11.429 --> 13:12.825
-Honey.
-(laughs)

13:12.825 --> 13:14.033
Come on, come on.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.693
Mike, I’m trying to enjoy this.

13:15.693 --> 13:17.759
-I know, this is
all about you enjoying it.
-Yeah.

13:17.759 --> 13:20.099
-I’m not here to ruin it,
I got it.
-Thank you.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.660
Now, before we take in
the nose of our wine,

13:22.660 --> 13:24.792
we must wake up our tongues.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.957
Eh!

13:27.957 --> 13:30.693
You’ll see at your stations
there are three items:

13:30.693 --> 13:32.957
peat moss, cowhide,

13:32.957 --> 13:36.099
and limestone.

13:36.099 --> 13:38.957
No dip.

13:38.957 --> 13:41.297
These are key reference smells

13:41.297 --> 13:44.297
so that we can identify
the tasting notes.

13:44.297 --> 13:47.924
Let’s begin with the limestone.

13:47.924 --> 13:51.528
I want you to smell it
and then give it a good lick.

13:51.528 --> 13:54.660
100 bucks for a class
licking a rock,

13:54.660 --> 13:57.759
it’s not even Dwayne Johnson.

13:57.759 --> 13:58.957
(sighs)

13:58.957 --> 14:00.957
All right, you know what, honey?

14:00.957 --> 14:02.957
You can either fundamentally
change yourself...

14:02.957 --> 14:04.660
(chuckles)
or leave.

14:04.660 --> 14:07.594
Listen, okay.

14:07.594 --> 14:09.330
Uh, I’ll see you at home.

14:09.330 --> 14:11.165
Oh, no.
Uh, are you leaving us, sir?

14:11.165 --> 14:13.627
Yes. I think I’m gonna drink
the way God intended,

14:13.627 --> 14:16.330
alone in my house
in my underwear.

14:18.462 --> 14:20.792
Do you know that gentleman?

14:20.792 --> 14:24.693
Oh, no, no. I-I think he was
looking for the AA meeting.

14:29.264 --> 14:32.924
Hey, I was thinking, what if
Fire Falcon had a brother?

14:32.924 --> 14:36.033
Kyle, quit it.
No more Train of Doom talk.

14:36.033 --> 14:37.825
It’s childish, remember?

14:39.495 --> 14:41.462
Oh, his brother could be
his evil twin.

14:41.462 --> 14:43.858
(both laugh)

14:43.858 --> 14:46.858
Oh, yeah, looking real good
down here, Kyle.

14:46.858 --> 14:50.099
Oh, yeah, yeah, she’s looking
real good up here, Ryan.

14:50.099 --> 14:52.099
Hey.

14:52.099 --> 14:56.099
Oh, hey. Sorry.
Didn’t hear you come in.

14:56.099 --> 14:58.792
We were busy
with our "responsibilities."

14:58.792 --> 15:00.297
We weren’t having any fun,

15:00.297 --> 15:01.660
if that’s what
you’re worried about.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.462
Yeah, uh, listen,
we felt like maybe

15:04.462 --> 15:06.297
we were a little bit
harsh earlier.

15:06.297 --> 15:07.693
We know that comic books...

15:07.693 --> 15:09.594
BOTH:
Graphic novels.

15:09.594 --> 15:12.330
(clears throat)
...mean a lot to you.

15:12.330 --> 15:13.792
Yeah, so?

15:13.792 --> 15:17.660
So, to apologize,
we did a little something.

15:17.660 --> 15:19.099
(clears throat)

15:19.099 --> 15:20.858
What you guys
came up with was great,

15:20.858 --> 15:23.957
so I just sort of polished
the artwork a bit.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.429
The first one

15:25.429 --> 15:29.792
is Fire Falcon being trapped
in this stuff.

15:29.792 --> 15:34.363
It’s, uh, Hemick-ulite.
It erases his memory.

15:34.363 --> 15:37.264
Yeah, yeah, and, um,

15:37.264 --> 15:40.924
this is Asteroid Girl
escaping the Stink Lava.

15:40.924 --> 15:42.825
The grappling hook was my idea.

15:42.825 --> 15:45.858
And, get this,

15:45.858 --> 15:48.000
we added two new characters

15:48.000 --> 15:50.528
to help Fire Falcon

15:50.528 --> 15:53.363
save the Train of Doom.

15:53.363 --> 15:56.528
KRISTIN:
It’s you and Kyle.

15:59.660 --> 16:02.363
Uh, Kyle, can I, uh,

16:02.363 --> 16:06.264
speak to you in the other room
for a second?

16:06.264 --> 16:08.033
Excuse us.

16:11.495 --> 16:13.858
RYAN AND KYLE (laughing):
Oh, my God!

16:13.858 --> 16:16.660
RYAN:
Oh, this is so fantastic!

16:16.660 --> 16:18.594
Her Fire Falcon is even better
than Bill Lamp’s,

16:18.594 --> 16:20.462
and the grappling hook
\his a really good idea.

16:20.462 --> 16:24.363
KYLE:
Wow! Look how muscular
my arms are!

16:24.363 --> 16:26.033
I haven’t worked out in a month.

16:26.033 --> 16:28.825
-(Ryan shushing)
-(Kyle clears throat)

16:33.198 --> 16:36.033
Uh, we discussed it,

16:36.033 --> 16:39.396
and we have decided
to accept your apology.

16:40.825 --> 16:44.033
And would you mind if we
took these over to Ronnie’s

16:44.033 --> 16:45.495
to show the other guys?

16:45.495 --> 16:47.330
Of course not. Have fun.

16:47.330 --> 16:50.528
(chuckles)
We’re glad you guys like it

16:50.528 --> 16:53.264
because we love that you are
the way you are.

16:53.264 --> 16:54.792
We love you guys.

16:54.792 --> 16:57.264
Oh, hey, uh, don’t use
the garbage disposal.

16:57.264 --> 16:59.495
Uh, actually,
don’t turn on the water.

16:59.495 --> 17:01.594
-You know what?
Just stay out of the kitchen.
-Yeah.

17:07.759 --> 17:10.231
-Oh, hi.
-Oh, buona sera.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.924
-Good, good, good.
You’re both here.
-Uh-huh.

17:14.924 --> 17:16.363
Well, what-what-what
is it, darling?

17:16.363 --> 17:18.198
I mean, is something,
is something wrong?

17:18.198 --> 17:20.165
-Mom, the other night...
-Yeah?

17:20.165 --> 17:21.627
...when I came into the garage

17:21.627 --> 17:24.132
and you were having your
little chat with my husband,

17:24.132 --> 17:26.759
were you maybe giving him
marriage advice?

17:26.759 --> 17:29.099
Absolutely not.

17:29.099 --> 17:31.429
Right.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.858
I... I may have said
a little something,

17:35.858 --> 17:38.000
and-and if-if he took it
the wrong way,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.495
now, pfft, I can’t help that.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.198
Wait, wh-what is that pain?

17:43.198 --> 17:45.330
Is that a knife in my back
I can feel?

17:47.759 --> 17:50.495
Mom, Mom, you are
gonna be around a lot,

17:50.495 --> 17:52.429
so I’m only gonna say this once:

17:52.429 --> 17:54.297
my marriage is my business,

17:54.297 --> 17:57.429
so keep your perfect
Connecticut nose out of it.

17:57.429 --> 18:01.198
-Look, I understand, dear.
I overstepped my bounds...
-Yeah.

18:01.198 --> 18:03.264
...and I’m sorry.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.165
Do you think we have
a strong marriage?

18:10.165 --> 18:12.528
Of course. It’s wonderful.
It’s really-- Yeah, it’s good.

18:12.528 --> 18:14.363
Let-- we should kiss.

18:14.363 --> 18:18.033
What, why would you
listen to her?

18:18.033 --> 18:22.693
She said, "Hey, Michael" twice,

18:22.693 --> 18:24.132
and she’s looking right at me.

18:24.132 --> 18:27.825
Stop, come on, come on.

18:27.825 --> 18:31.528
Some of what she said hit a note
with me, you know?

18:31.528 --> 18:35.660
Things have changed around here,
and-and I haven’t changed.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.495
What-what-what do you mean?

18:38.495 --> 18:40.033
Listen, when-when the...

18:40.033 --> 18:42.825
when the girls were here,
I had to fight for "me time."

18:42.825 --> 18:47.264
Now that they’re gone, why am I
still fighting for "me time"?

18:47.264 --> 18:50.462
Honey, look,
it-it-it’s fine with me

18:50.462 --> 18:52.924
if you enjoy doing things
by yourself.

18:52.924 --> 18:57.594
(sighs) Look, I don’t need
to be tying flies.

18:58.594 --> 19:01.660
I get these for free.

19:02.957 --> 19:05.198
I own a whole bunch
of fishing stores.

19:05.198 --> 19:07.264
-I’m up to my gills
in fishing equipment.
-All right.

19:07.264 --> 19:08.627
All right, all right, look,

19:08.627 --> 19:11.033
maybe you don’t need
to be tying flies,

19:11.033 --> 19:12.693
but-but every now and again,

19:12.693 --> 19:15.792
you need to be alone,
just like I do.

19:15.792 --> 19:17.165
And just like I do.

19:17.165 --> 19:19.495
-So you’re a horrible person.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

19:19.495 --> 19:22.099
Yeah, you want to know
how horrible? Yeah?

19:22.099 --> 19:24.000
You know how you have
that T-shirt that says

19:24.000 --> 19:25.363
-"I’d Rather Be Fishing"?
-Right.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.825
Well, I want a T-shirt that says
"I Am Glad He’s Fishing."

19:28.825 --> 19:31.495
So you want me time
just like I do. Me time.

19:31.495 --> 19:34.528
Exactly.
Honey, honey...

19:34.528 --> 19:35.858
we’re still good,

19:35.858 --> 19:37.693
you and I.
Okay?

19:37.693 --> 19:39.924
-Yeah, yeah.
-There’s no trouble here.

19:39.924 --> 19:42.198
So we don’t have to worry
about this?

19:42.198 --> 19:45.033
No, not worry,
but, um, yeah, I know,

19:45.033 --> 19:48.132
I guess we should be aware
that when the kids leave,

19:48.132 --> 19:50.033
it’s-it’s a big change.

19:50.033 --> 19:53.825
BONNIE:
That’s all I was trying to say!

20:03.528 --> 20:05.825
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

20:05.825 --> 20:08.627
talking about matrimony.

20:08.627 --> 20:10.363
Some marriages are so tight,

20:10.363 --> 20:14.330
you really get why it’s called
(clicks tongue) "wedlock."

20:14.330 --> 20:17.792
However, at the other extreme,
about two percent of couples

20:17.792 --> 20:19.957
are in marriages
that are called "open."

20:19.957 --> 20:23.297
Ew, about 50% of couples
are in an open marriage

20:23.297 --> 20:27.000
where one of them
doesn’t know it’s open.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.924
Yup, each marriage is different.

20:28.924 --> 20:30.363
Though in the case
of Henry VIII,

20:30.363 --> 20:31.858
they all tended to end the same,

20:31.858 --> 20:35.429
with the sound of a head
dropping into a little basket.

20:35.429 --> 20:37.693
King Henry actually used
master swordsmen

20:37.693 --> 20:40.594
because the French hadn’t
invented the guillotine yet.

20:40.594 --> 20:43.165
God, even in 1789,

20:43.165 --> 20:46.462
automation was a job killer.

20:46.462 --> 20:50.000
Now, some couples thrive when
they do everything together.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.825
I knew one fella
who insisted on going

20:51.825 --> 20:54.033
to his bride’s
bachelorette party.

20:54.033 --> 20:55.660
How’d that marriage turn out?

20:55.660 --> 20:59.792
Don’t know. I couldn’t stay
friends with him after that.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.165
Now, personally, I think
it’s healthy for married couples

21:02.165 --> 21:03.957
to enjoy separate interests.

21:03.957 --> 21:06.528
There’s nothing wrong with that,
unless one of those interests

21:06.528 --> 21:10.429
is making a movie
with Angelina Jolie.

21:16.033 --> 21:20.099
My wife and I have been
happily married for 30 years.

21:20.099 --> 21:24.033
People ask me how I do it.
It’s really very simple.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.858
I would die for her.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.825
Once you’re willing to do that,
the rest is easy.

21:29.825 --> 21:31.231
Baxter out.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.198
(chicken clucks)

21:35.198 --> 21:37.231
