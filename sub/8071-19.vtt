This happens every time those
two guys have a sleep over.

00:14.248 --> 00:18.419
DJ, quit bouncing that ball!

00:27.027 --> 00:28.396
You too, Todd!

00:36.003 --> 00:37.405
[jumping on bed]

00:39.973 --> 00:41.509
Now, see, you
didn't tell him not

00:41.609 --> 00:44.512
to jump up and down on the bed.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.114
Dan, go up there.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.415
Naw, it's your turn.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.750
I went last time.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.884
All right.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.953
Well, I guess if they
don't listen to reason,

00:53.053 --> 00:54.255
they're sure gonna
to listen to me.

01:06.033 --> 01:09.337
ROSEANNE: (SCREAMING)
Now listen up!

01:09.437 --> 01:13.141
There will be no talking,
no giggling or laughing,

01:13.241 --> 01:17.845
no playing music, no
singing, no animals noises,

01:17.945 --> 01:20.848
no doing whatever the hell
you were doing when you making

01:20.948 --> 01:24.318
that peg-leg kinda
thumping noise,

01:24.418 --> 01:29.290
no bird calls, no bouncing the
ball, and no jumping on the bed

01:29.390 --> 01:30.791
or I'm coming up there!

01:30.891 --> 01:32.760
Now go to sleep!

01:38.332 --> 01:41.235
Ah.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.271
That oughta cover it.

01:43.371 --> 01:47.575
Oh god, I'm gonna
be so tired tomorrow

01:47.675 --> 01:48.876
I won't be able to think.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.144
Yeah, me too.

01:50.244 --> 01:53.781
But luckily I'll be at work.

01:53.881 --> 01:57.251

[laughing]

02:41.595 --> 02:44.965
[music playing]

02:48.068 --> 02:51.272
Hey, come, Roseanne,
look at this counter.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.708
If you're not gonna do something
properly, now why bother?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.410
You know, you're right.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.848
All right, that's it.

03:00.948 --> 03:01.849
I give up.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.750
You're fired.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.753
[laughing]

03:07.288 --> 03:09.957
I'm not kidding, Roseanne,
now, I am the boss

03:10.057 --> 03:11.459
and you are the help.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.127
And if you can't accept that,
then I can call security

03:14.228 --> 03:16.797
and they will escort you out.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.098
OK.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.403
I'll clean the counter, Adolph.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.672
That's better.

03:24.772 --> 03:25.673
Ah, oof.

03:25.773 --> 03:30.077
I hate having to
suck up like that.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.512
Yeah.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.714
You know, ever since
he broke up with Steven

03:33.814 --> 03:36.917
he's such a crab.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.720
(SINGING) I know
something you don't know.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.588
What?

03:40.688 --> 03:41.989
Tell me.

03:42.089 --> 03:45.359
Well, yesterday while Leon was
at work Steven brought a truck

03:45.459 --> 03:47.328
to his house, took
all the furniture

03:47.428 --> 03:49.530
and his entire CD collection.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.698
No way!

03:50.798 --> 03:52.866
I swear to God, I
heard him on the phone.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.403
I mean, he's really hurt.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.805
I think I'll be a little
nicer to him today.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.906
Well, you're on your own.

04:02.042 --> 04:02.843
Roseanne?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.716
Hi, Kathy.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.584
I'm sorry to bother
you here at work,

04:10.684 --> 04:11.919
but this is about Todd.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.388
My son is exhausted today,
I thought you understood

04:14.488 --> 04:15.856
that his bedtime was 9 o'clock.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.725
Yeah, I got your memo.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.160
You know, that he's
allergic to strawberries,

04:20.260 --> 04:25.866
and he can't sleep on
polyester, and he's AB Positive.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.035
AB Negative, Roseanne.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.639
You could have killed him.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.607
I'm exhausted,
Kathy, so why don't you

04:33.707 --> 04:39.079
just tell me what my punishment
is and then we'll move on.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.750
When I tell Todd to go
to sleep, he goes to sleep.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.818
Well gee, you know, the boys
have been talking about having

04:44.918 --> 04:47.455
another sleep over
tonight, and since you

04:47.555 --> 04:52.125
are so good at putting people to
sleep, why don't you take them?

04:52.225 --> 04:53.427
Fine.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.895
Send DJ over after dinner.

04:54.995 --> 04:55.963
Great.

04:56.063 --> 04:56.864
KATHY: Goodbye, Roseanne.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.433
Ciao.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.635
You'll be watching the sun rise.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.870
Who was that?

05:02.970 --> 05:05.473
That is my lovely neighbor.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.574
Oh, the ice pop lady, eh?

05:06.674 --> 05:07.841
Mhmm.

05:07.941 --> 05:12.212
Frozen solid with a great
big old stick up her butt.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.213
He's back.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.493
Stop it.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.298
Look, I just got word
that upper management,

05:31.399 --> 05:33.000
in its infinite
wisdom, has decided

05:33.100 --> 05:34.835
to use our funky
little luncheonette

05:34.935 --> 05:38.906
for part of some
ill-conceived TV commercial.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.374
Cool, we're gonna be on TV?

05:40.474 --> 05:41.509
[chuckling]

05:41.609 --> 05:42.576
Oh, no.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.378
No, I could be
wrong here, but I'm

05:44.478 --> 05:45.946
guessing that the
waitresses will be played

05:46.046 --> 05:49.583
by friendly, courteous types,
who don't wander off to nap

05:49.683 --> 05:51.585
in the mattress department.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.186
In the meantime,
this whole place

05:53.286 --> 05:56.457
has to be scrubbed from top
to bottom, per the orders

05:56.557 --> 05:58.559
of my weaselly little boss.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.460
Oh,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.795
He's got one them too, huh?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.697
Now, they're gonna be
filming people eating

06:03.797 --> 06:05.799
somewhere in this
area, so I want all

06:05.899 --> 06:07.535
of these booths scrubbed down.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.069
Hey, are-- are
they paying these

06:09.169 --> 06:10.037
people to sit there and eat?

06:10.137 --> 06:10.938
Mhmm.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.640
$50 for the day.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.142
Hey, I'll take
a table for six.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.645
I have no control
over this, Roseanne.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.814
No, but you could go
and put in a good word.

06:20.914 --> 06:25.118
Perhaps, but why?

06:25.218 --> 06:31.459
Because, um, maybe I'll go
out and buy you a brand new

06:31.559 --> 06:32.926
Liza Minnelli CD.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.832
Wait a minute,
what do you know?

06:38.932 --> 06:42.670
I know about heartache.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.139
[music playing]

06:48.208 --> 06:49.577
This is such a joke.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.178
I mean, we go to
the mall on Saturday

06:51.278 --> 06:54.482
and sit around just
pretending we like lousy food?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.616
What is your problem?

06:55.716 --> 06:59.386
We've been rehearsing
for this all our lives.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.921
It's a lie, it's
demeaning, and it

07:01.021 --> 07:02.456
represents everything I hate.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.825
Well, then why are doing it?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.927
Money.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.295
Not me.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.130
It's in my blood.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.900
Hiya have friends, Discount
Dan here for Rodbell's.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.835
And if you're like
me, born to shop,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.004
you'll appreciate the
convenience and value of dining

07:17.104 --> 07:18.972
at Rodbell's, where
there's always

07:19.072 --> 07:22.209
something under the gravy.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.210
JERRY: Hey.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.646
Woah, must be my
ride to Hollywood.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.547
Morning, Dan.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.815
Hey, Jer, want some coffee?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.750
Oh, well, I gotta
take the boys to school.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.051
(SCREAMING) Oh, DJ.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.721
No, he's at my house, he
spent the night there, Dan.

07:33.821 --> 07:37.024
Right, right.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.259
I better get going too,
are you coming, Darlene?

07:39.359 --> 07:40.794
Yeah.

07:40.894 --> 07:44.532
Hey, Mr. Bowman, I heard
you and Mrs. Bowman screaming

07:44.632 --> 07:45.966
each other last night.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.367
Way to stand your ground.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.072
Very impressive.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.778
So I guess the, uh-- the
whole block heard us, huh?

07:57.878 --> 08:00.113
Nothing to be
embarrassed about, Jer.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.949
When you said we ain't
moving back to Chicago

08:02.049 --> 08:04.785
and that's final, men
all over the neighborhood

08:04.885 --> 08:06.086
took a little bit
more of the blanket.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.859
Really?

08:11.959 --> 08:14.127
To be honest with you, Jer,
I didn't think you had in you.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.696
Well, to be
honest with you Dan,

08:15.796 --> 08:18.732
we're moving back to Chicago.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.168
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, why?

08:21.268 --> 08:25.606
Well, Wellman's in big trouble
and big cutbacks in management

08:25.706 --> 08:27.975
and my job is one
of the first to go.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.577
Oh, man, I'm
sorry to hear that.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.244
Yeah, well, it happens.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.880
Could you find
something else here?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.148
Well maybe, but probably
not for the kind of money

08:35.248 --> 08:36.516
I was making there.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.186
But it's OK because I got a
job waiting for me in Chicago.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.554
What kinda job?

08:40.654 --> 08:44.424
It's like, uh, sort of
a, uh, a son-in-law job.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.663
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

08:49.763 --> 08:53.200
It's not gonna say that on
your parking space, is it?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.402
Well look I, just wanted
to let you know because we're

08:55.502 --> 08:56.904
gonna be putting the
house up for sale

08:57.004 --> 08:58.438
and Kathy asked
me if I could ask

08:58.538 --> 09:01.374
you, uh, if you
could, uh, if you

09:01.474 --> 09:03.977
could, uh, clean up your yard.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.414
Sure buddy, you got it.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.415
Oh, thanks, man.

09:11.418 --> 09:12.853
I'm gonna miss you, Jer.

09:12.953 --> 09:13.954
Same here, Dan.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.522
But you know what's
gonna be really tough?

09:15.623 --> 09:18.191
Is separating Todd and DJ,
I mean, those kids just

09:18.291 --> 09:20.127
get along so great together.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.028
Yeah.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.395
JERRY: Yeah.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.632
It was nice, DJ having
a friend the rest of us

09:24.732 --> 09:26.667
could see.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.135
[music playing]

09:30.237 --> 09:31.605
[video game music playing]

09:31.705 --> 09:33.273
Here comes your
sister, ask her.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.909
I'm not gonna ask
her, you ask here.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.044
You ask her!

09:37.144 --> 09:39.947
What do you geeks wanna know?

09:40.047 --> 09:42.683
What's a virgin?

09:42.783 --> 09:43.851
You in 40 years.

09:49.256 --> 09:53.293
OK, everybody excited
about the commercial today?

09:53.393 --> 09:54.194
Me too!

09:57.397 --> 09:58.198
Guys!

09:58.298 --> 10:01.168
What-- what are you doing?

10:01.268 --> 10:03.270
Chewing.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.504
What about you, Dan?

10:04.604 --> 10:09.209
I'm a little ahead of
you, dear, I just swallowed.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.146
Well, you're supposed to be
eating in the commercial today.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.048
If you ruin your appetites
now, you're never

10:15.148 --> 10:17.718
gonna be able to eat on camera!

10:17.818 --> 10:18.618
Is that so?

10:22.555 --> 10:24.457
Boy, I can't wait
to go back to Chicago

10:24.557 --> 10:26.660
and get out of stupid Lanford.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.963
Lanford's not stupid,
Chicago's stupid.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.300
It is not, Chicago's
got everything.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.235
- Does not!
- Does too.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.270
There's a big park
near my house,

10:37.370 --> 10:39.539
better than anything here.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.676
You're gonna have
to join a gang.

10:42.776 --> 10:43.610
No way.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.779
And my friends
have better games.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.614
Then go play with them.

10:47.715 --> 10:48.749
Hey, give me that.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.717
No!

10:49.817 --> 10:51.685
- Well then I'm gonna leave.
- Good.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.086
I mean it.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.488
It's getting
really ugly in there.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.957
Well, the way
Todd keeps yakking

10:57.057 --> 10:58.458
about moving back
to Chicago, I don't

10:58.558 --> 10:59.659
wanna play with him, either.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.195
Oh, Todd's a nice boy, though.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.663
He's good for DJ, too.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.132
Ever since they've
been playing together,

11:05.232 --> 11:07.901
the squirrel
population has doubled.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.637
I'm so glad we're
moving away from you.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.906
You're only moving to
Chicago 'cause your mom

11:13.006 --> 11:14.574
needs an operation.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.809
She does not.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.177
She does, too.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.113
My mom said she's having a big
stick taken out of her butt.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.392
[music playing]

11:44.271 --> 11:47.340
Like looking in
a mirror, ain't it?

11:47.440 --> 11:51.011
Check out the high heels
on Barbarella over there.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.412
Yeah.

11:52.512 --> 11:56.917
She steps on one mushed carrot
and her bony butt's gonna slide

11:57.017 --> 11:58.618
all the way to garden supplies.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.327
Deej, isn't this fun?

12:07.427 --> 12:08.228
No.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.334
You know, buddy, maybe
Todd's a little scared

12:14.434 --> 12:16.236
about moving back to
Chicago and he's just

12:16.336 --> 12:17.370
trying to be tough about it.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.841
I don't care!

12:20.941 --> 12:23.010
- He's still upset?
- Yeah.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.913
He didn't even wanna measure
his head in the shoe department.

12:28.115 --> 12:28.916
Hey, Beck.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.283
Where's Darlene?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.252
Well, they said she couldn't
be in the commercial dressed

12:32.352 --> 12:34.321
like Death.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.288
She go home?

12:35.388 --> 12:36.189
Not yet.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.270
Shut up.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.806
Why Darlene, you look--

12:52.906 --> 12:53.706
Shut up.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.607
Oh.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.343

13:03.350 --> 13:06.820
Now, uh, uh, OK, well,
what do you want us to do?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.321
Uh, just sit here and smile.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.626
So what do you think?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.728
Uh, yeah, I think so.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.730
You sure they look right?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.133
Well, let me get
a second opinion.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.369
Leon, come over here.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.037
We're just looking
at his family, here.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.039
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'll get rid of them.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.474
No, no, no.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.644
No, we're thinking of using
them as the average family.

13:31.744 --> 13:37.550
Well, aren't they a bit too
swap meet for-- for Rodbell's?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.451
No, no, no, no.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.921
No, believe me-- it's perfect.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.522
This is what
America's coming to.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.928
Wow.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.662
That's the family.

people just to sit here,

13:59.006 --> 14:00.874
Just be yourselves, OK?

14:00.974 --> 14:01.774
Can do, Kenny.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.646
Dad, you are
being such a doofus.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.782
Back off, Heidi.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.051
This is a rehearsal!

eats a french fries.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.717
Jackie, you have to come
over there and sit with us.

14:44.817 --> 14:45.953
Well, they told
me to sit here.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.990
Hey, hey, hey I'm the star
of the commercial, here.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.625
I think if I want you to sit
with us, you can sit with us.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.793
OK, great.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.595

14:55.695 --> 14:57.430
Uh, now, what am I playing?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.898
Well, the aunt.

The aunt.

OK.

Why are there two
mothers at this table?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.644
Oh, uh, she's the aunt.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.446
I don't want an aunt.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.848
OK, we'll lose her.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.118
- Hey.
- Am I wrong--

15:18.218 --> 15:19.686
the new mother's better?

15:19.786 --> 15:20.653
You're nuts!

15:23.290 --> 15:24.091
And more likable?

15:26.726 --> 15:30.430
Let's keep the
nicer, thinner mom.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.833
Stick the other around
the back somewhere.

Come with me, ma'am.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.549
I'm only getting 40.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.683
You're getting 40?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.686
Well, I was putting
money away for college.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.887
Take a hike, Aunt Roseanne.

sit there and smile,

Just said goodbye to Jerry.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.752
He gave me his keys
so I could keep

16:25.852 --> 16:27.987
on his house 'til they sell it.

16:28.088 --> 16:31.858
All right, finally,

Hey, Deej.

Why don't you go over
and see if you can help

16:35.262 --> 16:36.863
Todd finish packing his stuff?

16:36.963 --> 16:38.765
I don't wanna.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.933
Oh, go on DJ, he's
your best friend.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.602
He is not.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.438
Yes he is, and you're really
going to be mad at yourself

16:45.538 --> 16:47.574
if you don't go over
there and say goodbye.

the next couple of days.

in the right house.

know, it's not like I'd

something to say to Todd?

you're going to miss him.

Todd, DJ is just
really upset right now,

18:12.725 --> 18:15.328
but he wants you to know
that you are welcome to come

18:15.428 --> 18:18.365
and visit us any time.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.368
Well, DJ, the
same goes for you.

You're welcome any time, as
soon as we're settled in.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.476
And after my operation.

18:42.989 --> 18:49.329
Um, Todd, DJ wants you to know
that he's really sorry that he

18:49.429 --> 18:52.665
told you some of the
stuff that his mom kinda

18:52.765 --> 18:53.900
wishes that she didn't say.

18:57.737 --> 19:08.348
Well then, DJ, Todd
wishes that his mother

19:08.448 --> 19:21.060
had invited your mother over for
coffee, or something sometime.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.830
Well, DJ would've like that.
