I noticed some things
out of place this morning,

31:45.804 --> 31:47.137
and then later this afternoon,

31:47.172 --> 31:49.706
when I was here
with Jennifer and althea.

31:49.725 --> 31:51.842
Like somebody was
searching for something.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.577
Okay, a loose furnace grate
or a few things out of place

31:54.630 --> 31:56.246
is not proof of a search.

31:56.298 --> 31:57.692
Now, that room that
you were just in,

31:57.716 --> 31:59.049
that's what a place looks like

31:59.084 --> 32:01.168
when someone's trying
to find something to steal.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.670
What if he used the key
under the flower pot,

32:03.706 --> 32:06.206
but had to be more careful
because Jesse was home?

32:06.292 --> 32:08.125
What if Jesse woke up,

32:08.160 --> 32:10.460
he caught the guy
searching the den?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.546
What if Jesse didn't fall,
but he was attacked?

32:12.631 --> 32:14.698
You're suggesting
Jesse may have been murdered?

32:16.201 --> 32:18.201
Someone was looking
for something tonight,

32:18.236 --> 32:19.870
and someone broke into Jesse's...

32:19.905 --> 32:21.538
All right, you know what,

32:21.573 --> 32:23.240

the speculation train

32:23.292 --> 32:24.292
right now.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.994
Chief, I gotta say,

32:27.029 --> 32:28.790
I've been covering crime
in the city for 20 years.

32:28.814 --> 32:29.958
What she's saying
sounds plausible.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.115
I'm not saying
it's not plausible.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.183
I'm saying we have no evidence.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.202
You haven't even looked
for evidence

32:35.287 --> 32:36.954
as far as I can see.

32:38.557 --> 32:39.723
Sorry.

32:39.775 --> 32:41.558
Now, what I was
about to say was,

32:41.610 --> 32:43.610
out of an abundance of caution,

32:43.646 --> 32:44.811
we will seal off this house,

32:44.863 --> 32:46.647
and we will process it
as a crime scene...

32:48.033 --> 32:50.467
Until we get
Jesse's autopsy results.

32:50.486 --> 32:52.185
Thank you.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.526
No, you're right,
it's not a coincidence

33:16.562 --> 33:17.672
this guy broke into
Jesse's house

33:17.696 --> 33:19.062
only a few hours

33:19.098 --> 33:21.431
after someone broke
into his girlfriend's car.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.300
Yeah, he smashed
the window, stole the bag

33:23.369 --> 33:24.568
no more than 15 minutes

33:24.603 --> 33:26.353
after I gave you the keys
to the cottage...

33:26.405 --> 33:28.271
Oh, hey, hang on,
I have a picture.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.307
Oh.

33:29.358 --> 33:30.273
Um... there.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.309
Hold on.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.046
I saw that blue hatchback
when I was leaving.

33:36.065 --> 33:38.582
It was parked
in exactly the same spot.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.417
The driver had, uh, white hair.

33:40.436 --> 33:41.584
He was in his 50s.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.753
When I approached the car,
he drove off.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.289
But the car's still
there in the picture.

33:46.341 --> 33:48.392
Well, he probably
came back after I left.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.487
And maybe you came
out of the house

33:49.511 --> 33:50.343
faster than expected

33:50.379 --> 33:52.129
after he smashed that window?

33:53.515 --> 33:55.182
Can you tell
if that was the same guy

33:55.217 --> 33:57.417
you saw jumping over the fence?

33:57.469 --> 33:58.502
No.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.586
But it's got to be, right?

33:59.671 --> 34:01.605
I should have gotten
the license plate.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.074
Normally,
I would have done that.

34:04.093 --> 34:06.927
Does that mean this guy
has been racking althea?

34:07.012 --> 34:09.246
That he followed her
to Jennifer's,

34:09.281 --> 34:10.880
and then over to Jesse's?

34:10.916 --> 34:13.166
Possibly, yeah.

34:13.202 --> 34:15.013
I'm going to talk to althea
first thing in the morning.

34:15.036 --> 34:16.369
I'll show her the picture,

34:16.422 --> 34:18.233

anything that could help us.

34:21.243 --> 34:23.543
But don't you have
a masterpiece to be writing?

34:23.579 --> 34:25.911
Yeah, but I'm also
an investigative reporter,

34:25.998 --> 34:27.330
and I can't resist a knot

34:27.366 --> 34:29.416
that needs unraveling.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.101
The question is,

34:31.170 --> 34:33.070
why are you pushing this?

34:35.107 --> 34:36.507
I mean, why not
wait for the police?

34:37.609 --> 34:38.824
Well...

that I have paid a huge price

to take action

35:12.010 --> 35:14.544
Althea, we were wondering if
you had a few moments to talk?

35:14.563 --> 35:15.563
Sure.

35:18.634 --> 35:21.084
I've never seen this car before.

notice it yesterday.

you would think this person

of Jesse's in my car.

the most time with Jesse

Did he give you
any presents recently,

35:36.635 --> 35:39.369
even something that didn't
seem to have any value?

35:39.404 --> 35:42.005
Jesse wasn't materialistic.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.474
He believed
in sharing experiences.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.661
He took me places,
but didn't give me things.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.412
Did he mention anything
he was working on,

35:49.481 --> 35:50.680
maybe a secret project?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.950
Jesse didn't keep secrets.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.218
That's true.

to either one of you

something he was excited about?

of the Spanish Princess.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.403
All his stories

36:12.471 --> 36:14.187
were about entertaining us.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.605
Anyway, he told me

36:15.640 --> 36:17.274
he donated anything worthwhile

36:17.309 --> 36:20.009

here in lighthouse cove.

our very own lighthouse.

captain's tea service

off the coast of Florida

37:11.830 --> 37:13.964
in 1788.

his claim on this.

anything new?

on any dives lately, but...

37:29.164 --> 37:31.948
No, nothing new.

37:31.984 --> 37:34.517
And believe me, I asked him
every time I saw him.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.019
Uh, the last time you asked him,

37:36.071 --> 37:38.521
did he say he was planning
on making a new donation?

37:38.573 --> 37:40.440
No, he just kept saying

37:40.492 --> 37:42.452
the same thing he's been saying
for the past year.

37:42.494 --> 37:43.727

coming for you, Carol.

this museum famous."

just told us...

37:56.842 --> 37:58.536

something big to donate,

37:58.560 --> 37:59.776

and struck his head,

of the fireplace in the den.

outside Jesse's house,

Well, he...

Told me that story
about the Spanish Princess.

It's actually
a Portuguese Princess.

this man is following me?

you have the necklace,

it was bad luck to keep it.

to the museum.

out of that necklace.

for me to win Jesse's affection,

away from the house
