WEBVTT

00:09.357 --> 00:11.837
Terry, you're sure you know
how to fix the dishwasher?

00:11.924 --> 00:13.622
Oh, would you relax,
Beth?

00:13.709 --> 00:15.145
Oh!

00:15.232 --> 00:16.538
I spent six months

00:16.625 --> 00:18.540
as a plumber's apprentice
in New Zealand,

00:18.627 --> 00:20.281
and I can't tell you
how many times

00:20.368 --> 00:22.022
I had to snake out
Elijah Wood's toilet

00:22.109 --> 00:23.240
while they were shooting
"Lord of the Rings."

00:23.327 --> 00:25.373
Mm.
Really, unless it's zero,

00:25.460 --> 00:26.809
I don't want to hear about it.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.811
Oh, by the way,
I'm thinking of rebuilding

00:28.898 --> 00:30.030
the kids' tree house,
you know,

00:30.117 --> 00:31.292
since I burned down
the last one.

00:31.379 --> 00:32.902
Oh.
Oh, no.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.599
No...no, Terry,
you don't need to do that,

00:34.686 --> 00:36.384
and by that, I mean
please don't.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.560
Oh, come on, Beth.
You gotta let me do this.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.953
I mean, you guys
have done so much for me.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.522
I need to do something
to pay you back a little.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.177
I don't...I don't know.
I...

00:47.264 --> 00:49.179
I...I promise,
you got nothing to worry about.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.615
I'm a can-do dude.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.313
Check it out,
one last wrench

00:52.400 --> 00:54.837
with the...
whatchamacallit,

00:54.924 --> 00:59.233
and it is...fixed.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.979
Hey...

01:07.067 --> 01:10.200
there's no noises,
no smoke...

01:10.287 --> 01:12.246
- no leaks. I told you.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.551
They don't let just anyone

01:13.638 --> 01:17.077
install a hot tub
for Frodo Baggins.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.600
You know what?

01:18.687 --> 01:20.167
Okay, yes,

01:20.254 --> 01:22.256
you can rebuild
the tree house.

01:22.343 --> 01:23.735
Yeah.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.346
Kids deserve something fun.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.782
Thank you, Beth.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.479
Thank you.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.090
You won't regret it.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.537 --> 02:27.886
Wow, this tree house
is gonna be

02:27.973 --> 02:30.106
even cooler
than our house-house.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.455
I'll say one thing for him.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.414
His enthusiasm
is almost as contagious

02:33.501 --> 02:35.720
as the pinkeye
that he gave us last month.

02:35.807 --> 02:38.114
Uncle Terry...

02:38.201 --> 02:40.116
are you sure we can't help?

02:40.203 --> 02:41.683
Dad has a whole
chapter about

02:41.770 --> 02:43.641
building a tree house
in the Dangerous Book.

02:43.728 --> 02:46.253
And he says that we should
all work together.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.037
Sorry, Bromeo.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.691
This is something
I gotta do on my own.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.388
Besides, you think
that book is dangerous?

02:51.475 --> 02:52.998
Try construction.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.392
It is a nonstop battle
between wood and face,

02:55.479 --> 02:56.785
which is why I never leave

02:56.872 --> 02:58.743
without my trusty
safety goggles.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.877
But Dad was pretty clear
about including us all.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.534
Listen, I got this, kiddo.
Don't worry about it.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.100
You just worry about
how much fun you're gonna have

03:08.188 --> 03:11.365
when that baby's done.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.280
There's nothing safe
about these goggles.

03:17.632 --> 03:20.374
Yes, I see you, Terry!

03:20.461 --> 03:22.767
You're swinging that hammer
like a big boy!

03:25.509 --> 03:27.511
Oh, I hope he doesn't
mess this up.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.470
I'm under enough pressure
already.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.385
You gotta relax
a little, Beth.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.038
- You worry too much.
- I know,

03:33.125 --> 03:34.518
and I worry about that too.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.913
My parenting philosophy

03:38.000 --> 03:40.698
was to let the boys
make big mistakes

03:40.785 --> 03:44.963
so that they'll be able
to make bigger successes.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.617
Sure worked with Patrick.

03:46.704 --> 03:47.662
And Terry?

03:47.749 --> 03:49.054
Oh, Terry's due for

03:49.141 --> 03:50.795
a big win one of these days.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.057
Ow!

03:53.494 --> 03:54.582
Stupid goggles!

03:54.669 --> 03:57.019
Probably not today.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.108
Hey, Uncle Terry!

03:59.195 --> 04:00.109
Can you put a tire swing
on it?

04:00.196 --> 04:02.590
For you, Dash,
any swing.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.200
How about a zip line?

04:04.287 --> 04:06.420
I'll zip right down
and install one.

04:06.507 --> 04:07.377
Ooh, ooh, and a hammock!

04:07.464 --> 04:10.032
I'll ha...

04:10.119 --> 04:11.947
ham and cheese...

04:12.034 --> 04:14.602
cheese, sneeze...
oh, jeez.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.386
Yeah, I can put in a hammock.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.995
You know you're
currently violating

04:18.083 --> 04:20.084
half a dozen
building codes, right?

04:20.172 --> 04:22.305
But while you're up there,
make sure to install Wi-Fi.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.568
Oh, you got it, buddy.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.309
Hey, Uncle Terry!

04:26.396 --> 04:28.268
Can I get you
some iced tea?

04:28.355 --> 04:29.791
Or just tea,

04:29.878 --> 04:31.793
because I think we used up
all the ice

04:31.880 --> 04:32.837
when you hammered your foot.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.535
Stop bothering him, Wyatt.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.624
Would you annoy
that old artist guy,

04:36.711 --> 04:38.060
Mike Angelo,

04:38.147 --> 04:39.583
when he was carving
the "Mona Lucy"?

04:39.670 --> 04:41.672
I think you mean
the "Mona Lisa."

04:41.759 --> 04:43.892
I'm...I'm gonna stop you
right there.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.721
I don't think.
I just do.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.988
Wyatt!

04:54.598 --> 04:57.862
Oh, it's so great to see
another human being!

04:57.949 --> 05:00.082
It's great to see you too,
Dad,

05:00.169 --> 05:01.736
but you do kinda
smell a little.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.215
Oh, yeah.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.610
Think I broke Dash's record
for not showering.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.351
That was a stinky
six weeks.

05:08.438 --> 05:09.874
That was stinky.

05:09.961 --> 05:13.138
So how go things
back in civilization?

05:13.225 --> 05:15.663
Uncle Terry's
building us a tree house.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.012
That's nice.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.448
Are you boys pitching in?

05:18.535 --> 05:21.059
No.
I know you wrote that we should,

05:21.146 --> 05:23.453
but he wants to do it
by himself.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.586
Well, there's something
to be said

05:25.673 --> 05:27.283
for figuring stuff out
on your own.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.806
Like Liam over there.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.986
Sometimes it pays
to be an independent thinker.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.075
But I've always believed
in the old motto

05:37.162 --> 05:40.340
"United we stand,
divided we fall."

05:40.427 --> 05:42.211
Ha!
Who's stupid now?

05:42.298 --> 05:44.953
You totally forgot
the "E" in "sauce."

05:45.040 --> 05:47.085
I need to get
a picture of this.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.435
You have a cell phone?

05:48.522 --> 05:49.827
We can call for help,
you idiot.

05:49.914 --> 05:50.872
Give it to me!

05:50.959 --> 05:52.656
And waste my data?
No way!

05:52.743 --> 05:53.918
See?

05:54.005 --> 05:55.833
When times get rough,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.835
nothing works
if you don't stick together.

05:59.489 --> 06:00.577
Agh,
what are you doing?

06:00.664 --> 06:01.535
Give it to me!

06:01.622 --> 06:02.710
You drilled a smiley face

06:02.797 --> 06:04.276
in my trigonometry textbook!

06:04.364 --> 06:06.278
Yeah, I finally
made math fun.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.671
You're welcome.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.412
You guys just wait.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.632
This baby's gonna have
all the bells and whistles.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.852
I'm putting in the whistles
tomorrow.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.768
Oh, I have my whistle
from soccer camp.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.248
Maybe we could
put it in.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.423
Sorry, Wyatt.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.730
But this is a solo project.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.209
Just like when I sing
both parts

06:24.296 --> 06:26.211
to "I Got You Babe"
on karaoke night.

06:26.298 --> 06:29.432
- -

06:29.519 --> 06:32.304
Now, I don't want
to oversell this,

06:32.392 --> 06:36.221
but what you are
about to see

06:36.308 --> 06:39.573
will blow away
the pyramids of Giza

06:39.660 --> 06:43.707
and the Honolulu Half-Pipe
at Raging Water Sacramento.

06:43.794 --> 06:46.623
Terry! Terry! Terry!

06:46.710 --> 06:49.539
Zip line, zip line,
zip line!

06:49.626 --> 06:51.106
Without permits,
without permits,

06:51.193 --> 06:53.674
- without permits.
- Beth.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.153
Would you do us the honors,
please?

06:55.240 --> 06:58.592
Uh, yeah, I guess.
I don't...um...

06:58.679 --> 07:00.550
Hey, wait.

07:00.637 --> 07:01.551
Are these my good scissors?
I've been looking everywhere...

07:01.638 --> 07:03.161
Dash, drumroll, please!

07:04.467 --> 07:06.121
Oh, the trumpet sound
works too.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.602
Friends, neighbors,

07:08.689 --> 07:10.430
peoples of Earth,

07:10.517 --> 07:11.996
may I present to you...

07:12.083 --> 07:14.042
you, you, you, you, you...

07:14.129 --> 07:16.218
the McKenna family tree house.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.785
Yes, snip.

07:17.872 --> 07:21.049
Whoo-hoo!

07:27.751 --> 07:30.232
Terry, Terry!

07:32.887 --> 07:34.758
Oh, what'd I tell you?
The kid's a winner.

07:34.845 --> 07:37.152
Just took him 40 years
to get over the hump.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.719
You know, I gotta admit it,
Terry,

07:38.806 --> 07:41.330
I had my doubts,
but this is spect...

07:50.774 --> 07:52.907
What?

07:52.994 --> 07:54.256
Oh...

07:55.779 --> 07:57.259
Oh!

08:04.875 --> 08:06.964
Beth, how hard
did you cut that ribbon?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.014
This is crazy.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.233
Yeah, crazy great.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.496
How many people
do you know

08:16.583 --> 08:18.280
have a moon roof
in their room?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.021
Can't be more than a thousand.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.894
At least the Dangerous Book
is safe.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.288
Oh, so's my third-grade diary.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.898
I was all over
Tesla stock

08:27.985 --> 08:29.596
right from
jump street.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.815
No! No!

08:31.902 --> 08:33.121
Stay with me, Sunny!

08:33.207 --> 08:34.601
You're...you're gonna
be okay, right?

08:34.688 --> 08:37.691
Oh, man,
this is a disaster.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.780
I know.
I was totally off base

08:39.866 --> 08:41.738
on my valuation
of Bed Bath & Beyond.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.871
I must have been insane
to let you build

08:43.957 --> 08:46.787
that ridiculous tree house!
I...

08:46.874 --> 08:48.353
How many times
can I say I'm sorry?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.616
- Well... I mean, seriously.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.618
Pick a number.
10,000.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.010
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

08:53.097 --> 08:54.534
Oh, my God, stop it.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.753
Sorry.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.407
That was an apology
for apologizing.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.887
That doesn't count
against the 10,000.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.715
Okay, he messed up.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.021
But he messed up trying to do
something nice for the kids.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.849
That's gotta count
for something.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.199
He could have killed
my children, Tiffany.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.071
My children.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.116
Okay, that also counts
for something,

09:12.203 --> 09:13.683
but how about
we call it even?

09:13.770 --> 09:15.685
Everything you've done
since you got here

09:15.772 --> 09:17.252
has been a total disaster,

09:17.339 --> 09:19.384
and it's just...
enough is enough.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.517
I need to protect
my family right now.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.346
Terry, you...
you need to leave this house.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.567
Or what's left of it.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.264
Beth, you can't do that.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.658
I can and I just did.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.573
Terry, you've gotta go.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.795
Have you guys ever seen Mom
that mad before?

09:38.882 --> 09:40.405
No, not even
at the Indians game

09:40.492 --> 09:42.451
when I tried to get
Corey Kluber's autograph.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.540
You ran out to the mound in
the middle of the fifth inning.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.889
His pitch count was up.
I wanted him to sign

09:45.976 --> 09:47.761
before his arm got too tired.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.024
At least Mom's letting us
sleep outside in the fresh air.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.503
The only fresh air I like is

09:51.591 --> 09:52.592
the Mountain Citrus spray
I blast

09:52.679 --> 09:54.289
after you use the bathroom.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.030
Aren't you guys worried
about what's happening?

09:56.117 --> 09:58.423
Mom just kicked
Uncle Terry out,

09:58.510 --> 09:59.816
and there's a giant tree
in the middle of our room.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.339
Forget about that stuff, Wyatt.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.515
What you should be worried about
is bear attacks.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.256
There are no bears in Akron.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.736
That's what the Lipinsky family
thought.

10:06.823 --> 10:07.781
Remember them?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.347
Yeah, they moved to Omaha.

10:09.434 --> 10:10.566
That's what the bears
want you to believe.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.524
Hey, guys?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.309
Uh...

10:14.396 --> 10:17.138
I think...I think we need
to talk about Uncle Terry.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.618
You know, and I know
that you may not

10:18.705 --> 10:20.054
understand this
right now,

10:20.141 --> 10:22.926
but his leaving
is for the best.

10:23.013 --> 10:25.146
Okay?
Protecting you boys...

10:25.233 --> 10:27.627
it is the most important job
I will ever have,

10:27.714 --> 10:29.629
and I do not take it lightly.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.761
Can we at least
say good-bye to him?

10:31.848 --> 10:34.546
Oh, sweetie, um...

10:34.634 --> 10:36.723
he didn't want
to upset you guys any more,

10:36.810 --> 10:39.508
so he just left.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.863
Uncle Terry
was the greatest.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.648
Remember the time
when he melted

10:48.735 --> 10:51.868
all the little jelly beans
into one giant jelly bean?

10:51.955 --> 10:53.174
That was awesome.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.741
Awesome?
He ate the whole thing

10:54.828 --> 10:56.220
and barfed rainbow-colored vomit

10:56.307 --> 10:57.613
all over the back
of the Astrovan.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.397
awesome.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.443
Uncle Terry was a wild card.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.010
Mom did what she had to do.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.359
Why are you always
such a jerk?

11:04.446 --> 11:06.143
Why are you always
such an idiot?

11:06.230 --> 11:07.492
Guys! Come on.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.799
when times get tough,

11:09.886 --> 11:12.019
we've gotta stick together.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.285
Oh, man, it's the bear
that ate the Lipinskys!

11:17.372 --> 11:18.982
I thought I made that up.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.985
- Hey, dudes. Uncle Terry,

11:22.072 --> 11:24.422
you scared the heck
out of...those two.

11:24.509 --> 11:25.946
You guys gotta help me.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.469
I can't make it out there
on my own.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.992
Somebody stole my pants,

11:29.079 --> 11:30.559
so I had to steal
someone else's pants.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.952
Long story short,

11:32.039 --> 11:33.518
these are not my pants.

11:33.605 --> 11:36.130
You've only been gone
for five hours.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.958
Oh, come on, guys,
just help me.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.395
I don't wanna
have to leave!

11:40.482 --> 11:42.310
I miss you guys.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.312
Aw, he's so cute.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.227
Can we keep him

11:46.314 --> 11:47.619
I say we let him stay.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.099
Well, Mom kicked him out
for a reason.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.930
But I guess one night
couldn't hurt.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.106
Oh, thank you!
And if a guy named Wild Dave

11:56.193 --> 11:57.629
comes looking
for a pair of khakis,

11:57.717 --> 11:59.240
I was never here.
Move over.

11:59.327 --> 12:00.676
I want the warm spot.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.027
Mm-hmm.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.769
Yeah, no...
yes, no, I'm looking at

12:06.856 --> 12:08.945
what you sent over,
but I don't understand.

12:09.032 --> 12:12.427
Is it...is it an estimate
or is it a phone number?

12:12.514 --> 12:14.168
No, I don't...I don't want
your phone number.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.866
No, I'm t... Never mind.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.434
I will have to figure
something else out.

12:24.569 --> 12:28.486
Uh, you're...
you're doing that all wrong.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.097
Excuse me?

12:30.184 --> 12:31.881
You're just...you're stacking
the bowls all wrong.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.840
My God, not the bowls!

12:33.927 --> 12:36.364
Please, Beth, don't throw me
out of the house too.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.895
Have you ever considered

12:45.982 --> 12:49.638
you might have some
teensy, tinsy control issues?

12:49.725 --> 12:51.988
Like everything has to be
exactly your way?

12:52.075 --> 12:53.468
Right?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.471
What, my...my way?

12:56.558 --> 12:58.081
Nothing is my way.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.823
I can't afford to fix
the hole in my house,

13:00.910 --> 13:03.478
my kids are living
like wild animals,

13:03.565 --> 13:05.828
and I'm barely holding on
to my sanity,

13:05.915 --> 13:07.612
but, ooh, check it out!

13:07.699 --> 13:08.831
Lucky me!

13:08.918 --> 13:10.180
If the bowls are stacked
this way,

13:10.267 --> 13:12.226
I can fit the salad bowl
in the cupboard!

13:12.313 --> 13:14.097
Ooh!

13:16.970 --> 13:18.667
My way.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.764
Agh!

13:28.851 --> 13:30.722
- Yuck. Hey!

13:30.810 --> 13:32.115
Get your butt
away from my face.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.030
Get your face
away from my butt.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.424
You're unbelievable.
Even your dumbness is stupid.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.384
You can use that whole can,
but you still stink!

13:40.471 --> 13:41.603
Come on, guys.

13:41.690 --> 13:42.952
We're falling apart.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.998
Please don't start fighting
again.

13:45.085 --> 13:45.912
Shut up!

13:45.999 --> 13:47.391
Seriously?

13:47.478 --> 13:49.263
That's what you can agree on?

13:51.613 --> 13:52.832
You know what?
I've had enough!

13:52.919 --> 13:53.789
As of...

13:55.878 --> 13:58.402
37 a.m. in the morning,

13:58.489 --> 14:00.535
we are officially un-brothers!

14:00.622 --> 14:02.015
And I don't share a tent
with brothers

14:02.102 --> 14:04.060
who used to be my brother.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.758
Oh, yeah?
Well, two can play at that game!

14:06.846 --> 14:08.325
You don't even exist to me
anymore.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.892
I'm yelling at no one!

14:13.330 --> 14:16.681
Mm...
smells like mountain citrus.

14:21.730 --> 14:22.949
Oh, for God's sake.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.341
Let me help you!

14:24.428 --> 14:25.429
Help me how?

14:25.516 --> 14:27.040
By reading a gossip magazine

14:27.127 --> 14:28.476
or forgetting to make dinner
or...

14:28.563 --> 14:29.999
I don't know,
maybe you want to

14:30.086 --> 14:32.480
read my horoscope
and tell me that my...

14:32.567 --> 14:34.961
my Neptune's in night-rograde,
hmm?

14:35.048 --> 14:36.571
Okay, that's not fair.

14:36.658 --> 14:39.879
I'm trying my best.
We all are.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.663
and it's your Mercury
that's in retrograde,

14:41.750 --> 14:43.578
and it explains a whole lot.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.493
Yeah, I stand corrected.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.104
You're tremendously helpful.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.367
You know, Beth,
you might feel a little better

14:50.454 --> 14:51.542
if you stopped carrying
the weight of the world

14:51.629 --> 14:53.675
on your shoulders.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.764
Well, that's kinda hard,
because the weight of the world

14:55.851 --> 14:57.374
is on my shoulders, Tiffany.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.855
It's all on my shoulders.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.865
Oh!

15:09.952 --> 15:12.607
Ah!

15:14.826 --> 15:16.393
Oh, my God.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.531
Yeah.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.576
Yeah, I know you're laughing.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.153
Can't sleep either, huh?

15:37.240 --> 15:39.155
I know how you feel,

15:39.242 --> 15:40.809
but I'm here for you,
buddy.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.160
I don't know, Uncle Terry.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.684
It's just, I tried to get
everyone to get along

15:46.771 --> 15:50.340
like Dad wanted,
but it's all just a mess.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.560
Everyone's fighting,
we're all in separate tents,

15:52.647 --> 15:55.171
and I don't know
what to do about it.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.478
Just help me figure out
what to do.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.568
You're the only person
who will even listen to me.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.702
Unbelievable.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.401
Can't count on anybody.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.926
Sunny's dead,
and you don't care!

16:11.013 --> 16:12.449
It's just
a stupid flower!

16:12.536 --> 16:14.060
You're just
a stupid flower!

16:14.147 --> 16:16.018
Stop!

16:16.105 --> 16:18.281
Get off me.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.501
- Ugh, get off of me, jerk! Come on!

16:20.588 --> 16:22.633
Stop! Jerk!

16:22.720 --> 16:23.939
Ton of noise
coming from...

16:24.026 --> 16:26.333
Oh, Dash and Liam,
quit it.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.552
You guys, stop it, seriously!
What is going on?

16:28.639 --> 16:30.337
Cut it out, boys.
Come on, now.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.513
I love wrestling, but only
when it's fully scripted.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.993
Get off me!

16:34.080 --> 16:37.126
Stop, please!

16:37.213 --> 16:38.954
Please.
- Terry,

16:39.041 --> 16:41.174
- what are you doing here

16:41.261 --> 16:43.089
Wild Dave's, but that is
not important right now.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.873
What is important...
- Okay, when I told you

16:44.960 --> 16:46.092
that you needed to get out,

16:46.179 --> 16:47.919
I did not mean
to our backyard!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.965
Terry...
Don't you yell at me!

16:50.052 --> 16:51.488
You guys stop it!

16:51.575 --> 16:52.924
You stop it right now.
Just stop!

16:53.012 --> 16:54.404
Ow! Stop!

16:54.491 --> 16:56.711
I can't take this anymore.

16:56.798 --> 16:59.366
I just wish I was alone.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.109
This is more like it.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.935
Peace and quiet.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.808
Nobody yelling,

17:06.895 --> 17:09.070
nobody fighting,

17:09.157 --> 17:12.857
just...nobody?

17:22.432 --> 17:23.390
Dad?

17:24.739 --> 17:26.088
Dad, is that you?

17:30.527 --> 17:34.662
Dad, are you here?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.229
I'm all alone.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.765
I did not mean
to our backyard!

17:50.852 --> 17:52.158
- Yelling at him...
- I am wrong. I'm so wrong.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.550
You were right.
You were right.

17:53.637 --> 17:54.943
I'm wrong. Stop it.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.032
You're making
the Astroturf lumpy.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.860
I can't stand to see
you guys this way,

17:58.947 --> 18:00.470
and it's all my fault!

18:00.557 --> 18:01.950
Beth, I'm sorry.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.473
I should never have come back.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.693
Now, I'm gonna leave now
for good.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.042
It'll be better this way.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.655
No, it won't.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.485
Mom.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.190
Terry, wait.

18:25.234 --> 18:28.716
You don't have to go.

18:28.803 --> 18:29.804
What?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.893
It's not your fault.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.329
Okay?
I'm to blame too.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.289
I've been stressed
and I've been angry,

18:36.376 --> 18:38.421
and I'm...I've just been
taking it out

18:38.508 --> 18:41.424
on all of you guys,
and I'm sorry.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.383
Okay?
Because I think the...

18:43.470 --> 18:47.082
the person I'm really
angry at...isn't here.

18:48.910 --> 18:52.131
And it's not Patrick's fault
that...

18:52.218 --> 18:53.828
that he left,
but I can't help

18:53.915 --> 18:55.308
being mad at him
that he did,

18:55.395 --> 18:59.486
and I've just felt so...
so alone.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.272
You're not alone, Mom.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.709
We're here.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.885
And even through
all of the fighting

19:07.972 --> 19:09.452
and the problems,

19:09.539 --> 19:11.759
we need to be together,

19:11.846 --> 19:13.456
because nothing

19:13.543 --> 19:15.589
is worse than feeling alone.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.636
You're right, sweetheart.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.986
I don't want any of you
to feel that way.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.424
Okay?
Because we're not alone.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.774
None of us.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.471
And you too, Terry.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.434
Come back.

19:34.521 --> 19:35.870
Come on.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.657
Oh...

19:42.920 --> 19:44.270
You know, now I get it.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.054
Hmm?

19:46.141 --> 19:47.621
I thought you guys
wanted me to

19:47.708 --> 19:50.232
take Patrick's place.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.147
Instead, you just helped me
to find my own place.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.411
Oh, it's just like
the '60s,

19:55.498 --> 19:57.718
but this time,
I remember everything.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.897
I just wish your twin brother
were here to see this.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.247
Twins.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.684
Of course!

20:07.771 --> 20:10.252
Jumping jungle stripes!
The Tiger Twins!

20:11.819 --> 20:12.820
Yes!

20:14.865 --> 20:18.652
Okay, that was a really weird
thing to say, even for Terry.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.829
I just remembered,
your dad and I

20:21.916 --> 20:22.960
saved up all
our favorite treasures

20:23.047 --> 20:24.135
from when we were kids

20:24.223 --> 20:25.789
in this old lunch box.

20:25.876 --> 20:28.096
The Tiger Twins?
- Never heard of it.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.576
Oh, it was the best cartoon.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.012
Two tiger brothers
sneak out of the zoo

20:31.099 --> 20:32.927
to fight crime.
It was awesome!

20:33.014 --> 20:34.929
This stuff's gotta be worth
a small fortune!

20:35.016 --> 20:38.237
We could sell it
to fix the roof!

20:38.324 --> 20:39.847
Uh, is that treasure?

20:39.934 --> 20:41.196
'Cause it sure looks and...

20:41.283 --> 20:43.590
...smells like junk.

20:44.417 --> 20:48.856
Yeah, it sure seemed special
back when we were kids.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.250
- I'm sorry. I...
- It's okay.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.208
We'll figure something else out.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.776
Right? Together.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.446
Welcome back, son.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.230
Dad!

21:15.317 --> 21:17.972
I was worried you might have
been gone forever.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.278
Not a chance.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.541
I told you,

21:21.628 --> 21:24.108
I am here for you, always.

21:25.196 --> 21:27.111
So how'd it go
with the tree house?

21:27.198 --> 21:29.113
Not so great,
but we stuck together,

21:29.200 --> 21:30.985
and we made it through.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.379
I knew you would.

21:33.466 --> 21:34.728
There's gonna be
lots more adventures

21:34.815 --> 21:37.644
highs and lows,

21:37.731 --> 21:41.125
plenty of surprises,

21:41.212 --> 21:43.693
but I'll be here to help.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.304
I know you will.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.053
Dad, would it be
all right

21:56.140 --> 21:58.142
if I brought you
some soap next time?

21:58.229 --> 21:59.753
That bad, huh?

22:01.929 --> 22:03.365
Mm.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.714
Man, it's good to be back.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.586
May I please have
six more waffles?

22:06.673 --> 22:08.152
Guys, I just Googled it.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.937
The treasure wasn't inside
the lunch box.

22:10.024 --> 22:11.330
It is the lunch box.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.679
This baby's a rare collectible.

22:12.766 --> 22:13.897
It's worth a ton of money!

22:13.984 --> 22:15.334
Are you kidding me?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.031
Go, Uncle Terry!

22:17.118 --> 22:18.902
Attaboy, son!

22:18.989 --> 22:20.643
I told you he was
due for a win.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.253
And you were right.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.125
It looks like you
saved the day, Terry.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.214
I mean, you were one of
the reasons it needed saving,

22:26.301 --> 22:27.476
but you did it.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.565
I've got to say,
even I'm impressed.

22:29.652 --> 22:32.612
Oh, honey, don't cry.

22:32.699 --> 22:35.354
No, no, these are
tears of joy.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.225
I found my Tommy Tiger
action figure

22:37.312 --> 22:39.575
with real fake fur.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.231
I thought I'd
lost him forever.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.059
You guys are gonna
want to see this.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.502
It's from your dad.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.723
What?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.159
What do you think it is?

22:59.682 --> 23:02.163
I have no idea.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.035
Well, if it's from Patrick,

23:05.122 --> 23:07.037
could be almost anything.
