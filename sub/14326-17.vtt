YOU'RE GOING BACK.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.511
{\an1}I WISH HE WAS
BACK IN MY MIND.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.887
{\an1}AND I WISH HE
WAS THERE WITH ME.

18:24.269 --> 18:24.353
AAH!

18:30.901 --> 18:34.446
{\an1}HEY, WHAT GIVES?
WHERE AM I?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.657
{\an1}WE'RE IN YOUR
IMAGINATION, TIMMY.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.866
{\an1}THAT'S WHAT YOU
AND GARY WISHED FOR.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.619
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S NOT MY MIND?

18:40.702 --> 18:42.329
IT SEEMS PRETTY
EMPTY IN HERE.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.540
I GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.837
[SCREAMING]

18:58.053 --> 18:59.847
{\an1}I WISH...

19:01.181 --> 19:02.724
AAH!

19:02.808 --> 19:04.226
AAH!

19:04.309 --> 19:05.185
{\an1}OH, NO, THEY
CAN'T HEAR ME,

19:05.269 --> 19:08.021
{\an1}SO I CAN'T WISH
MY WAY OUT OF HERE.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.189
[RUMBLING]

19:11.316 --> 19:13.193
WHICH IS COOL.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.194
YOU DIG THIS?

19:14.278 --> 19:18.407
{\an1}THIS IS THE BOX YOU
PUT ME IN FOR 5 YEARS,

19:18.490 --> 19:20.325
{\an1}AND THAT'S NOT COOL,
BOO-BOO.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.414
GET HIM!

19:25.497 --> 19:27.332
AAH!

19:30.127 --> 19:30.377
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.633
AAH!

19:45.475 --> 19:47.102
{\an1}HA HA!
YEAH, BABY!

19:47.185 --> 19:48.270
GARY, WHY?

19:48.353 --> 19:52.024
{\an5}YOU STOPPED
PLAYING WITH ME
5 YEARS AGO.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.610
{\an1}YOU THREW ME ASIDE
WHEN YOU GOT REAL FRIENDS,

19:54.693 --> 19:56.486
{\an1}LIKE I WAS ONE
OF YOUR OLD TOYS.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.322
REMEMBER THESE, TIM-TIM?

19:58.405 --> 20:02.743
{\an5}STACKING LOGS,
TV TUBBIES,
SOCK PUPPETS.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.703
OH, MAN, GARY'S
TOTALLY GONNA CRUSH ME

20:04.786 --> 20:07.164
{\an1}UNDER ALL MY STUPID
5 YEAR-OLD TOYS.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.958
I'M 10.
I KNOW 10-YEAR-OLD STUFF,

20:10.042 --> 20:12.085
AND 10 BEATS 5.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.465
AND AS SOON AS
HE'S OUT OF THE WAY,

20:16.548 --> 20:18.425
I'M THE ONLY ONE
YOU'LL BE LISTENING TO.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.886
{\an5}COME AGAIN?

20:18.508 --> 20:20.886
WE CAN'T
HEAR ANYTHING.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.054
[RUMBLING]

20:28.852 --> 20:29.603
HI, GARY.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.272
MEET MY PAL
THE SURGEON GENERAL--

20:32.356 --> 20:33.482
ONLY FOR USE BY KIDS 10 AND UP.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.405
AND THIS IS <i> MY</i> MIND!

20:40.489 --> 20:42.908
{\an1}HEY, HEY, HEY,
EASY, DUDE.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.993
{\an1}REMEMBER ALL THE
GOOD TIMES WE HAD?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.245
{\an1}THE TEETERTOTTER?
DUCKY LAND?

20:47.329 --> 20:50.499
{\an4}THERAPY?
THE MONSTER
IN THE CLOSET?

20:52.584 --> 20:52.793
AARGH!

20:52.876 --> 20:55.003
AAH!

20:55.087 --> 20:56.421
HEY, WAIT.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.047
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT

20:57.130 --> 20:58.423
BECAUSE
WHEN I WAS 6,

20:58.507 --> 21:01.635
{\an5}I LEARNED IT
WASN'T A MONSTER
IN MY CLOSET.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.511
IT WAS JUST A SWEATER.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.556
WHAT?!

21:06.640 --> 21:08.266
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I LEARNED AT 8?

21:08.350 --> 21:11.061
{\an5}I LEARNED WHAT
A REAL MONSTER
WAS LIKE.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.697
GARY, VICKY.
VICKY, GARY.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.282
AARGH!

21:24.366 --> 21:26.034
AAH!

21:26.118 --> 21:27.536
NOT COOL, POOPY.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.746
{\an1}AAH!
NO, DON'T!

21:32.958 --> 21:34.918
TWERP!

21:39.172 --> 21:41.883
I WILL GET OUT OF HERE.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.969
AND WHEN I DO,
HO, HO, HO, YES,

21:44.052 --> 21:44.886
YOU'LL PAY.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.222
I SWEAR BY ALL THAT IS--

21:47.305 --> 21:48.682
CORN?

21:48.765 --> 21:52.978
I SWEAR BY ALL THAT IS COOL...

22:00.569 --> 22:01.987
I'LL MISS GARY.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.906
YOU KNOW, GARY,
FROM THE IMAGINATION 5.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.409
I WAS THERE,
AND TIMMY, HE WAS THERE,

22:07.492 --> 22:07.868
AND, WANDA,
YOU WERE THERE,

22:07.951 --> 22:09.870
REMEMBER?

22:09.953 --> 22:13.248
AH, GOOD TIMES.
GOOD TIMES.

22:13.331 --> 22:15.834
{\an4}YOU KNOW,
I'LL SORT OF
MISS GARY, TOO.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.503
DEAL WITH IT
IN THERAPY!

22:18.587 --> 22:20.005
{\an1}I WISH WE WERE
OUT OF HERE.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.719
[SCREAM]

22:31.892 --> 22:33.810
WOW! THAT
WAS CLOSE.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.354
YEAH, BUT THE GOOD NEWS
IS I'M OUT HERE,

22:36.438 --> 22:39.566
AND GARY--GARY'S
BACK WHERE HE BELONGS,

22:39.649 --> 22:41.443
INSIDE MY IMAGINATION,

22:41.526 --> 22:43.445
AND NO MATTER
HOW COOL HE IS,

22:43.528 --> 22:45.447
HE'S NEVER GETTING OUT.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.698
AND I'VE GOT THE KEY,

22:46.782 --> 22:48.075
AND I LOCKED THE DOOR.

22:49.618 --> 22:49.993
I THINK.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.329
OH, WHATEVER.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.459
Vicky: AH-CHOO!

22:57.542 --> 23:00.003
I HATE COOL.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.963
HEY,

23:02.047 --> 23:02.839
THE DOOR'S OPEN.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.092
COOL.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.636
HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA.

23:07.719 --> 23:08.804
OH.

23:10.138 --> 23:13.433
WHEW. LAUGHING MANIACALLY--
NOT COOL.
