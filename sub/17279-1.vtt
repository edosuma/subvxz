WEBVTT

00:19.199 --> 00:21.189
He threatened to start 1992 with a bang.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.555
He was finally going to get a piece of that action infamous New Year's Eve party.

00:46.066 --> 00:48.023
- Cristiana'm Johnny. - I also.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.489
I'm saving myself for marriage.

00:51.990 --> 00:54.533
- When did we get married? - When in 21 years.

00:57.334 --> 00:58.777
We should not be doing this, Johnny.

00:59.378 --> 01:01.244
We could catch a plague or something.

01:01.245 --> 01:04.587
- A plague? - If a pest.

01:05.589 --> 01:07.000
I better go.

01:12.701 --> 01:16.111
The year-end party also step from very bad to worse.

01:23.912 --> 01:27.555
- Wait, wait, wait. - They should not have children this holiday season.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.399
I'm 16 actually.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.999
Pope is insane and shameless. A deadly combination.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.777
It's a plane, a plane is ready to fly.

02:04.355 --> 02:05.444
Happy New Year.

02:05.445 --> 02:09.999
SPUD 3 READY TO FLY.

03:03.798 --> 03:05.598
Two weeks later.

03:05.599 --> 03:09.299
Come quickly. Your father is having an affair.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.300
What?

03:12.801 --> 03:13.440
What's up?

03:13.441 --> 03:16.700
Your father is having a midlife crisis.

03:17.301 --> 03:19.400
Tangling with the new neighbor.

03:20.201 --> 03:25.222
- Looks Portuguese. - And you know the Portuguese.

03:25.223 --> 03:28.400
- What her name? - Amber.

03:28.801 --> 03:32.888
- Amber warning means. - And what I received the warning.

03:35.989 --> 03:38.111
Go you were very chatty with the neighbor, right?

03:40.712 --> 03:42.711
He was picking up the mail.

03:42.712 --> 03:46.200
Three letters. All seem important.

03:49.901 --> 03:50.901
The bank.

03:52.102 --> 03:56.155
You know what the best place to store the warnings of the bank.

03:57.456 --> 04:00.555
- Some of your school, Johnny. - What it is?

04:08.556 --> 04:10.666
They will take your scholarship.

04:12.467 --> 04:16.201
"We regret to inform our school ..."

04:16.202 --> 04:20.649
"... Intentions to terminate his scholarship at the end of the year because ..."

04:20.649 --> 04:24.888
"... His poor performance and bad behavior in general."

04:28.789 --> 04:31.893
"If performance does not improve in the remainder of the year, the scholarship ..."

04:31.894 --> 04:34.900
"... It will be transferred to another person more worthy of it."

04:34.901 --> 04:41.111
You See? This is what comes of drinking, and smoking, and behave like a madman!

04:41.112 --> 04:44.111
! You can not take the scholarship the boy just because it is going through a bad time!

04:44.112 --> 04:46.777
I mean, Milton will be the first to win an Oscar.

04:48.278 --> 04:49.278
Fire!

04:53.279 --> 04:54.907
With you as a role model not me ...

04:54.908 --> 04:56.500
... Strange that the boy is caving.

04:58.001 --> 05:00.788
What if we opened the third envelope?

05:01.189 --> 05:03.200
There has to be good news.

05:19.555 --> 05:21.189
It is my recruitment for the army.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.744
- What ?! - What?

05:22.745 --> 05:24.299
No, they can not do that, you're 15.

05:24.300 --> 05:29.555
If left school I have to join the army and serve the motherland.

05:32.056 --> 05:33.056
This is serious.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.457
You better open a bottle of wine.

05:39.458 --> 05:41.458
BACK TO SCHOOL.

05:48.659 --> 05:51.144
I do not want to worry about the scholarship.

05:51.145 --> 05:53.726
I have a business opportunity with which we will ...

05:53.727 --> 05:56.400
... Make as much money we will use it as toilet paper.

06:03.901 --> 06:06.555
Good luck, honey. I wish you well, my child.

06:06.856 --> 06:07.856
Thanks Mom.

06:34.457 --> 06:35.457
Hi guys.

06:37.158 --> 06:41.444
- How are you doing? - Friend!

06:45.145 --> 06:47.888
- Hey, how are you? - Dude, good to see you.

06:49.589 --> 06:52.788
Hey, you must be Spud Milton. Garlic am Malawian Garth.

06:53.489 --> 06:56.111
- Obviously you've been in Malawian. - No.

06:56.112 --> 07:00.944
What? It's the best place on earth, what would love.

07:00.945 --> 07:03.555
Oh, my God, it's amazing! My father owns a factory.

07:03.556 --> 07:06.200
- Yes, take one. - Thank you

07:07.701 --> 07:09.660
The boys always wanted to be part of this band and ...

07:09.661 --> 07:11.822
... Now I feel like a full member of the Seven Secrets.

07:15.723 --> 07:17.500
Sorry, what did you say?

07:17.501 --> 07:19.728
I am already a member of the Secret Seven.

07:19.729 --> 07:22.111
Seven ha-ha secrets?

07:22.112 --> 07:26.888
How nice. Really we are not a bunch of kids with a pathetic name sticks.

07:27.389 --> 07:29.300
We are friends.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.399
We have scars to prove it.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.889
So next time you decide to open that big mouth ...

07:33.890 --> 07:36.288
... Yours, you'll want to have the right information.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.999
It is the Crazy Eight.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.111
it's okay. Enjoy that.

07:41.412 --> 07:44.444
And trust me, you queras not to repeat that mistake again.

07:48.945 --> 07:50.666
The Seven Secrets!

07:50.667 --> 07:53.000
Do not worry, little one, these things happen.

07:53.001 --> 07:55.888
Tell me more about those dreams of yours.

07:58.189 --> 08:00.144
Eight Locos were so extreme as ever.

08:04.945 --> 08:06.600
Rumbo was taking steroids.

08:11.301 --> 08:13.555
Simon knew before the new director.

08:14.456 --> 08:16.479
And welcomed to school.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.500
What the hell is going on here?

08:23.001 --> 08:24.800
Hey, it's busy, what the hell is wrong with you ?!

08:24.801 --> 08:27.999
Vern gave amarrillas cards for firing odors around.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.788
Boggo new house hairdresser chose and was raging.

08:31.789 --> 08:34.111
- How do I look? - Magnifico, filled with so much personality.

08:34.111 --> 08:35.111
Who's next?

08:35.113 --> 08:37.777
Fatty, shared her supernatural Voodoo with the new guys.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.888
The names receiving today will be yours forever.

08:40.889 --> 08:45.555
- Tu way de Pito. ¡Dilo! - How to de Pito.

08:45.956 --> 08:48.899
Cachetón. - Cachetón.

08:49.900 --> 08:54.200
- Stasegem. - Stasegem.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.800
- Raw. - Why-?

08:56.801 --> 08:58.444
- Say it! - Raw.

08:59.345 --> 09:03.033
- And your son Mel Ryan. - Son of Mel Ryan.

09:03.034 --> 09:06.666
Together they are the five frail.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.666
- Hold. - Sharks

09:09.667 --> 09:11.888
- Stuart Landry. - Sharks.

09:11.889 --> 09:13.888
- Milton. - Sharks.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.478
Class of 1992, not exactly the smartest.

09:20.279 --> 09:22.333
Anything you want to share with the Milton house?

09:22.334 --> 09:25.777
- No Norman.
- Si, no Norman.

09:25.778 --> 09:26.555
I stretched.

09:26.556 --> 09:29.400
I am surprised to see who is the head of the house.

09:29.401 --> 09:32.666
Whiteside To be honest, I'm surprised you to pass grade.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.033
Especially you, Mr. Black. Maybe some ...

09:37.034 --> 09:39.400
... Of you know me as Mr. Richardson.

09:39.401 --> 09:41.777
Others may know me as Mr. Viking.

09:41.778 --> 09:45.111
But rather to consider me as your damn worst nightmare.

09:45.712 --> 09:48.999
Viking is a maniac, but at least appreciates good theater.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.978
Clumsy and skeletal boys.

09:50.979 --> 09:52.400
It is our new director of the home.

09:52.401 --> 09:53.288
Boys bland.

09:54.333 --> 09:57.111
But there is the question if this is the right person for such hard work.

09:57.612 --> 10:00.233
Whereas it has had six heart attacks since 1985.

10:06.634 --> 10:07.634
They can be removed.

10:11.435 --> 10:15.046
Whiteside, I wonder if you're familiar ...

10:15.047 --> 10:18.288
... With the term, "divide and conquer."?

10:28.989 --> 10:29.989
Spud, Viking wants to see you.

10:32.890 --> 10:33.890
Right now.

10:40.491 --> 10:42.399
Not have much time so I will be frank.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.788
- Did you read the letter? - Yes sir.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.888
I am aware of the worrying incidents in this house last year.

10:50.889 --> 10:52.788
I hope you do not fall into the same traps.

10:53.889 --> 10:58.222
The scholarship is a gift, Milton, not a title.

10:59.523 --> 11:00.523
Yes sir.

11:04.024 --> 11:06.788
I was the protagonist in school, sir work.

11:06.789 --> 11:08.566
That was almost two years ago.

11:08.567 --> 11:12.222
Since then your school performance has been declining.

11:12.623 --> 11:15.099
Your sports skills are common.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.444
And your overall fitness and behavior is that of a bully.

11:18.445 --> 11:23.444
Lord, I just want you to understand that if I leave the school ...

11:23.945 --> 11:27.444
- I'll have to join the army. - I doubt it, Milton.

11:27.645 --> 11:33.900
The army has certain physical requirements and your complexion is ridiculous ...

11:35.701 --> 11:39.400
To summarize, your future is uncertain.

11:43.601 --> 11:46.144
And sir, how I keep my scholarship?

11:46.945 --> 11:49.777
Prove that you are someone worth it.

11:49.778 --> 11:52.578
Achievements, brings glory to this school and to this house.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.111
I will do my best, sir.

11:58.012 --> 12:00.888
You could, of course, become the prefect of your home.

12:00.889 --> 12:04.344
A leadership position next year could ensure your leadership.

12:06.145 --> 12:08.145
And how do I become the prefect of the house, sir?

12:08.546 --> 12:12.566
Trying on that are superior to your peers.

12:16.967 --> 12:20.255
I began my quest for glory trying to enter the cricket team.

12:20.256 --> 12:22.333
Garlic, where did you learn to play cricket?

12:22.334 --> 12:23.533
In Malawain, sir.

12:24.734 --> 12:25.734
That explains it.

12:30.635 --> 12:33.111
- Malon? - No sir.

12:33.912 --> 12:37.111
No? Next!

12:41.012 --> 12:44.111
Well done. Do it again.

12:49.612 --> 12:52.444
- That was a googly? - I think so, sir.

12:53.145 --> 12:54.145
Out.

12:57.046 --> 12:58.046
You did it again!

12:58.047 --> 13:01.189
I felt I was under a divine and beautiful spell.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.677
- I did not know you were layers of this. - Not me, sir.

13:04.678 --> 13:10.400
I'll get you to the tests to enter the starting lineup. Congratulations.

13:10.401 --> 13:11.901
Thank you very much, sir.

13:12.602 --> 13:15.666
Finally, my quest for glory was beginning.

13:15.667 --> 13:16.667
Next!

13:22.268 --> 13:24.111
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit, sit.

13:25.912 --> 13:26.912
Something plot.

13:29.713 --> 13:34.999
Gentlemen, I must remind you that at the end of the year will choose the head of house?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.666
And two prefects to guide next year?

13:38.167 --> 13:41.111
- Norman. - Thank you, director.

13:41.712 --> 13:46.816
Gentlemen, listen carefully, become a prefect or the head of the ...

13:46.817 --> 13:51.788
... House, like myself, is the highest honor that can give this school.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.509
Guide and control your home.

13:55.310 --> 14:00.155
Set the example. In short, you are God.

14:02.256 --> 14:05.111
As governors will have their own room.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.322
And two slaves to do all your homework.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.222
Sort and be dogs.

14:18.623 --> 14:20.333
Awake, Milton!

14:25.834 --> 14:30.700
These are the new plans for the rooms of the prefects.

14:31.301 --> 14:34.333
I thought you might be interested in.

14:36.634 --> 14:37.634
Thank you sir.

14:41.735 --> 14:43.500
I would hope not, guys.

14:44.101 --> 14:45.222
Take my place has its tricks.

14:45.223 --> 14:48.111
They are crazy if they think they may occupy two of those places.

14:49.112 --> 14:50.112
Lame botas.

14:53.013 --> 14:56.096
You'll see how cocky you feel to give your speech to ...

14:56.097 --> 14:59.033
... Preselection prefect in the conference room.

15:01.034 --> 15:05.899
Really, only bureaucrats as your mind being a prefect.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.888
So swallow your pathetic attempt at bravery.

15:08.889 --> 15:12.999
Eight Crazy are not for sale.

15:32.800 --> 15:36.333
So we agree? None of the Crazy Eights seek to be prefect, yes?

15:38.534 --> 15:40.455
A covenant is a covenant.

15:45.256 --> 15:47.444
Spud, have you?

15:53.045 --> 15:55.222
No one spoke of being prefect when Rambo was close.

15:55.823 --> 15:57.444
But just behind that you heard speak.

15:57.445 --> 16:02.111
Spud, come here. The new rooms of the prefects will be phenomenal.

16:02.112 --> 16:04.660
A fully equipped kitchen with

16:04.661 --> 16:07.666
refrigerator, toaster and fryer.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.777
Breakfast in bed every day.

16:15.378 --> 16:17.144
- Hey, Rambo. - What's going on?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.445
What do you see?

16:29.246 --> 16:30.246
it's okay.

16:32.247 --> 16:37.444
Or are Eight Crazy or try to be prefects.

16:39.745 --> 16:41.222
The choice is yours.

16:50.323 --> 16:51.723
VACATION.

16:51.724 --> 16:54.666
Home feeling I lost my scholarship was beginning to show.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.444
- What do you mean? - It's none of your business.

16:56.445 --> 16:59.666
I do not talk in that tone because I will not listen.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.444
So better silent, man.

17:02.945 --> 17:05.111
It is the subject of the question.

17:05.412 --> 17:07.665
Dad even started selling their devices.

17:10.367 --> 17:13.788
But Innocent is still making money from the sale of illegal liquor.

17:24.789 --> 17:26.777
The rumor spread like fire.

17:34.078 --> 17:37.233
Until I came to the ears of the long arm of the law.

17:37.234 --> 17:38.923
It's just a fortifier.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.788
Fortunately has a brilliant lawyer to argue the case.

17:41.789 --> 17:44.788
As always I win cases not cast me away.

17:44.789 --> 17:49.788
Seeking Mr. Milton, but somehow only see their daughters.

17:49.789 --> 17:52.000
The lawyer assured mom that will win the case.

17:52.001 --> 17:54.233
Let's talk business.

17:54.234 --> 17:57.489
At the end Innosence was found innocent.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.999
Thank my God.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.244
But his life ended in the black market.

18:04.245 --> 18:05.745
Bastard.

18:05.946 --> 18:09.333
My heroic efforts were rewarded with tests to enter the starting lineup.

18:09.334 --> 18:10.666
Boys form a circle.

18:11.667 --> 18:17.111
Hear that are Gods Crochet, so I wish good luck to all.

18:17.112 --> 18:20.899
If he repeated my first performance, achieved in easily.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.555
Let's see what they can do.

18:24.556 --> 18:27.177
Remember, this is a beautiful game.

18:27.878 --> 18:29.278
Much better than football.

18:40.879 --> 18:44.333
Disaster! My parents came to see me attempt to enter Crochet team.

18:46.634 --> 18:50.577
Well, boy, concentrate and I'll do the rest.

19:19.611 --> 19:21.955
Do not be scared, I was lucky.

19:24.056 --> 19:25.556
Ignore them. Relax.

19:36.157 --> 19:39.299
Try not to get really nervous.

20:00.455 --> 20:03.444
I have it, I have it!

20:09.745 --> 20:12.788
- It's over. - And I made history in the Croquet again.

20:14.389 --> 20:16.111
This time as the most shameful performance of all.

20:16.112 --> 20:17.112
What are you looking at?

20:17.813 --> 20:19.555
The school board are asses, you know?

20:19.556 --> 20:25.111
There are many ways to measure quality only in games.

20:25.112 --> 20:28.177
Look, have you been eating? - Yes.

20:28.778 --> 20:31.188
- You look like Keth Richards. - Really?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.899
I just have a lot of worry, sir.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.888
Oh, my God, is she!

20:35.389 --> 20:37.588
- Who? - The new librarian.

20:37.589 --> 20:39.788
- I did not want to run into her. - Do you know her?

20:39.789 --> 20:41.111
- Sorry? - Do you know her?

20:41.112 --> 20:42.112
No, no, no.

20:47.113 --> 20:51.999
I'm too old for this, but it is exactly as I imagined.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.777
If you so interested, why not simply greets?

20:55.778 --> 20:58.111
It would be a disaster, I will not.

20:58.512 --> 21:00.444
It can not be that bad.

21:01.844 --> 21:02.844
Now, go.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.111
- Hi. - Hi.

21:07.712 --> 21:10.333
Hello, sorry.

21:10.934 --> 21:12.144
- Hi. - Hi.

21:12.545 --> 21:17.388
He did not want to scare her, just wanted to say welcome.

21:17.389 --> 21:18.389
Thank You.

21:22.190 --> 21:23.100
- Well, welcome. - Thank You.

21:23.902 --> 21:26.944
Sorry, ma'am, let me introduce you to my English teacher.

21:26.945 --> 21:27.945
Mr. Edly.

21:27.946 --> 21:31.788
- How is Mr. Edly? - How are you again?

21:32.489 --> 21:33.989
Nice to meet you.

21:33.990 --> 21:40.400
- Okay. - Well bye.

21:46.201 --> 21:48.921
This deserves a celebration breakfast. I think I have ...

21:48.922 --> 21:51.266
... A little Christmas turkey in the refrigerator.

21:51.467 --> 21:54.233
- Sir, is March. - No, it is not.

22:03.634 --> 22:07.788
Well, if you do not eat, you can eat you.

22:10.989 --> 22:13.691
Actually I've been a mess lately, sir.

22:13.692 --> 22:16.444
The school wants to take my fellowship at the end of the year.

22:17.545 --> 22:18.545
Oh Heavens.

22:19.846 --> 22:22.888
Obviously my parents can not afford it so ...

22:23.389 --> 22:28.999
I have to stop studying. Actually I got my call from the army.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.400
The army? For what you want, bait?

22:37.701 --> 22:41.788
Do you have suggested higher-ups as you go to get your scholarship?

22:41.789 --> 22:47.999
If I can bring glory to school or I can turn prefect.

22:48.500 --> 22:51.110
Well, here is the solution.

22:51.111 --> 22:53.278
That's the problem, sir. The eight Locos

22:53.279 --> 22:55.600
We made a pact not to seek to be prefects.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.701
Are not you going to fulfill it, do you?

22:58.702 --> 22:59.702
I gave my word, sir.

23:05.403 --> 23:08.566
Listen, John. Take my advice.

23:08.567 --> 23:13.400
The hard fact of life is that you have to live with your decisions.

23:13.401 --> 23:15.777
You do not have to stand with your friends.

23:17.778 --> 23:18.978
So what should I do, sir?

23:18.979 --> 23:21.899
Well, you heard Darwin, right? Survival of the fittest.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.333
Fight tooth and nail for your scholarship.

23:25.934 --> 23:26.934
Not sure where to think.

23:26.935 --> 23:32.455
Begins with a list, bring order to chaos.

23:35.056 --> 23:36.056
Thank you sir.

23:44.444 --> 23:46.900
The genius of having nothing to lose,

23:49.501 --> 23:51.111
It is that you have everything to gain.

23:53.612 --> 23:58.777
The Chief is right, when you face large-scale chaos, you have a list.

24:01.278 --> 24:03.578
Play bowling.

24:05.479 --> 24:08.594
Now that the former coach of rugby under 14 years ...

24:08.595 --> 24:11.888
... Had become minister is qualified to teach confirmation.

24:12.289 --> 24:14.617
If no point to confirmation classes, then you can

24:14.618 --> 24:16.788
say goodbye to your chances of becoming prefects.

24:17.589 --> 24:19.444
It is already a miracle if they are in school.

24:20.345 --> 24:22.666
The best they can do is confirmed and thank him.

24:27.367 --> 24:30.078
Rambo wanted to set an example by saying that he would eat

24:30.079 --> 24:32.788
It faces whoever pointed to confirmation.

24:39.689 --> 24:41.888
But the stench of greed was everywhere.

24:45.189 --> 24:46.689
Some was subtle ...

24:49.290 --> 24:50.290
And another not.

25:04.777 --> 25:07.000
¡Spud, Spud!

25:07.701 --> 25:09.999
- What? - They're removing the list.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.933
- Now? - Makes two minutes.

25:12.734 --> 25:13.734
Damn!

25:22.335 --> 25:24.999
Mr. Lilly want to add my name to that list.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.777
Of course, Milton, just do it on my back.

25:32.278 --> 25:36.111
The Lord is our shepherd, and the Lord loves an enthusiastic sheep.

25:38.912 --> 25:42.777
Welcome to the fold. I think I'll give them a little more time.

25:43.378 --> 25:45.444
Spud What are you doing?

25:48.045 --> 25:49.445
Guys, I have to do this.

25:52.146 --> 25:53.333
Otherwise the school will that you remove

25:53.334 --> 25:56.600
Me no matter what your reasons, cross your name off the list.

25:57.101 --> 25:58.101
I do not can.

25:59.602 --> 26:01.888
But a deal is a deal.

26:04.689 --> 26:05.999
I'm breaking the covenant.

26:15.500 --> 26:19.177
Rambo said he opened the Pandora's box, but the others did not seem concerned.

26:31.278 --> 26:33.555
And in the end all they signed up for confirmation.

26:39.256 --> 26:41.888
Even Rambo claiming that just made it to watch me.

26:45.289 --> 26:47.122
Now all were becoming spiritual.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.666
Simon went to the chapel five days a week.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.576
The group Fatty voodoo spirit invoked furious

26:54.577 --> 26:56.111
a former teacher named Mackarter.

27:00.412 --> 27:01.412
Wait!

27:13.913 --> 27:16.888
Garlic bribed church with two hundred grand.

27:27.689 --> 27:31.233
Boggo directs Christian worship even though three Jewish quarter.

27:34.534 --> 27:37.444
And Vern is devouring his Bible from apostles revelations.

27:42.845 --> 27:44.970
While the Chief had a sacred place in the library

27:44.971 --> 27:46.909
for information on the new librarian.

27:55.310 --> 27:59.909
Two things were certain. One, God would punish us for being so hypocritical.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.923
And two, thanks to me, the competition to become

28:02.924 --> 28:04.677
prefect had officially begun.

28:08.878 --> 28:11.444
Have they heard of Christine's birthday party?

28:11.445 --> 28:12.445
It will be insane!

28:13.046 --> 28:15.444
If you come you may be able to have an erection.

28:16.645 --> 28:19.900
Actually I just got this.

28:21.201 --> 28:26.333
"Dear Johnny. What if we spent a weekend together? I miss you."

28:26.334 --> 28:28.500
With love.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.001
EASTER VACATIONS.

28:36.602 --> 28:40.500
He was definitely going to happen this weekend. I hope they are sufficient 110.

28:43.201 --> 28:45.999
- Johnny! - Debbie, hello, how are you?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.111
I'm fine. Glad you could join us this weekend.

28:50.112 --> 28:51.112
¿Join us?

28:52.513 --> 28:57.999
Gav! He is Johnny.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.900
So are the Johnny both have heard?

29:00.901 --> 29:02.333
- Nice to meet you. - Likewise.

29:02.334 --> 29:04.555
- All hail Johnny. - Hi, Johnny.

29:04.556 --> 29:07.500
- And what else? - God loves you!

29:07.501 --> 29:11.788
It will confirm and is a brilliant singer.

29:11.789 --> 29:14.444
it's great. Your bags are there, you can take them.

29:16.545 --> 29:20.144
Johnny, you're going to love this bus trip.

29:21.745 --> 29:24.200
Again, one, two, three!

29:24.201 --> 29:30.144
Cheers, cheers Jesus and his soldiers!

29:30.745 --> 29:35.999
Cheers, cheers Jesus, cheers and cheers!

29:36.000 --> 29:38.777
God must be punishing me for pressure to be prefect.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.222
And by repeatedly imagining the moment siren and I make love.

29:47.423 --> 29:50.400
Cheers, cheers Jesus and his soldiers are the best!

29:50.701 --> 29:53.055
I had learned three things about Gavin, the youth pastor.

29:53.056 --> 29:56.233
It is too old to be a youth pastor.

29:56.234 --> 29:58.488
Two, only knows a song-

29:58.489 --> 30:02.333
And three, she likes my girlfriend.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.534
That's.

30:03.535 --> 30:07.188
I can handle the pathetic trust exercises and endless edges,

30:07.189 --> 30:09.909
but even Spud has its limits.

30:26.999 --> 30:32.333
Hello Friend. Sorry, but you are in the bedroom of boys next door.

30:37.734 --> 30:38.734
Johnny.

30:43.835 --> 30:46.836
- Johnny, wait. - Why do not you go with your boyfriend?

30:46.837 --> 30:49.344
It's not my boyfriend, my spiritual guide.

30:49.345 --> 30:52.200
- It seems to me your boyfriend. - It's just very sensitive.

30:52.601 --> 30:55.333
- For 15 years old. - 29 actually has.

30:55.334 --> 30:57.111
That's very, very old.

30:57.512 --> 31:00.666
- It's creepy. Forget it. - Johnny waiting.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.499
- What? - Where are you going?

31:02.500 --> 31:04.222
- Back home. - But it is late.

31:07.423 --> 31:09.758
And there before dying fires

31:09.759 --> 31:12.144
fire, siren and I ended forever.

31:22.245 --> 31:23.545
Thank you very much.

31:35.444 --> 31:37.444
And take this with you!

31:38.545 --> 31:42.111
- Anda. - Nothing happened.

31:42.112 --> 31:44.777
- I already told you. - Nothing happened, my ass.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.599
Get out of here long!

32:01.111 --> 32:04.555
My boy, whatever your mother tells you, believe the opposite.

32:09.956 --> 32:12.788
You know what's wrong with your father? You know what?

32:13.089 --> 32:15.666
You can not keep it in his pants, that's the problem.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.999
The catch, the catch in the act.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.700
I should haberselo cut when I had the chance.

32:22.701 --> 32:25.233
Depending on who you spoke, the story was different.

32:25.234 --> 32:28.999
Dad says he was only helping to fix their drainage Amber.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
You need to cover it. Even this need ...

32:32.301 --> 32:38.900
Waterproofing. That helps. I do not think ... need waterproofing.

32:39.201 --> 32:41.999
Mom's version was different.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.111
I hope that unclog your pipeline.

32:45.112 --> 32:48.955
Blessed are you, and that tool that size.

32:49.756 --> 32:53.155
I'll be right there when you need me.

32:57.856 --> 33:00.400
I do not think, Daddy, come here now.

33:03.501 --> 33:05.888
Family, love, school.

33:06.589 --> 33:08.866
All away from me under my slippery feet.

33:36.767 --> 33:38.267
If you move you're dead.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.888
That does not make me anything.

33:45.289 --> 33:48.233
- Who you are? - It's me.

33:48.534 --> 33:50.888
- Your uncle Frank. - Who?

33:50.889 --> 33:53.444
Your uncle Frank, a friend of your dad. Remember when you had were a kid, Uncle Frank?

33:53.445 --> 33:55.445
What are you doing here?

33:55.446 --> 33:56.666
Your dad wants you.

33:57.167 --> 34:00.209
The new dad's best friend, Frank. Dad says that's bad news.

34:00.210 --> 34:01.510
Dad was taking astray.

34:02.211 --> 34:04.900
Put this on and hurry.

34:05.601 --> 34:07.601
It's time for you to meet the guys.

34:07.602 --> 34:11.110
they are amazing. Do you want some?

34:11.112 --> 34:13.350
After looking at our liquor and take

34:13.351 --> 34:15.500
refrigerator leftovers out to find Dad.

34:37.998 --> 34:39.666
Do you like my new house?

34:41.367 --> 34:42.766
Come take a look.

34:43.368 --> 34:49.666
Free and every morning the sun comes through my window.

34:51.167 --> 34:54.998
There's a word for that. Privilege.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.488
This is not permanent.

35:04.689 --> 35:07.779
Frankie and I are planning something big.

35:07.780 --> 35:10.222
- Or not Frank? - Big business.

35:10.223 --> 35:12.444
- It could be massive. - Huge.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.999
I feel that I've heard before.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.888
- But this time seriously. - You are giving their best.

35:18.889 --> 35:22.922
I can not say much now. It is confidential.

35:23.423 --> 35:27.300
- Confidential. - And if it fails?

35:28.501 --> 35:33.555
We push your grandmother and charge the estate.

35:34.856 --> 35:36.256
That is the plan B.

35:37.857 --> 35:42.222
Do not worry about school, have fun and not worry about your scholarship.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.444
We got you covered.

35:44.745 --> 35:48.444
- Do you want a drink? - No, no, I'm fine.

35:48.445 --> 35:52.111
- I have glasses. - Okay, good.

35:54.212 --> 35:56.212
Second half.

35:58.313 --> 35:59.313
Tests for Rugby

35:59.314 --> 36:02.688
If he went to the team, I recover my scholarship in a heartbeat.

36:20.889 --> 36:23.222
Thank you, gentlemen, I note the good work.

36:27.700 --> 36:31.300
Viking impress. Enter the first team of Rugby.

36:31.501 --> 36:34.700
These are your chances of being prefects.

36:34.701 --> 36:40.600
First Robert Black. Second, Simon Brown.

36:40.601 --> 36:43.799
Tercero Alan Greenstein.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.600
It was under Garlic.

36:46.701 --> 36:48.289
And he is Malawain.

36:48.990 --> 36:49.990
John Milton.

36:53.191 --> 36:55.191
Impresionar a Norman Whiteside.

36:57.592 --> 37:02.788
We must love our neighbor.

37:03.989 --> 37:09.888
Sorry, Mr. Lily, do we still love our neighbor if he is satanic?

37:09.889 --> 37:13.233
You must love all Alan, as passionate as possible.

37:13.234 --> 37:18.811
Passionately ¿? Basically you say we have sex with our neighbor?

37:19.712 --> 37:23.777
No, not sex, not unless you marry your neighbor, Robert.

37:23.778 --> 37:26.111
Why does your wife live next door, Lord?

37:38.612 --> 37:39.612
Impress God.

37:43.813 --> 37:45.999
Now guys, let's suck some blood.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.677
It is traditional to get some action at parties Christine.

37:53.678 --> 37:57.111
But tonight was a strange electricity in the air.

37:57.112 --> 38:00.112
Hello, Christine, you look like a great vampire.

38:00.813 --> 38:02.113
Come with me.

38:16.314 --> 38:19.149
Christine, I hope this does not sound strange, but I feel

38:19.150 --> 38:22.033
I'm ready to have a real relationship with someone.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.666
I also. I'm ready for it.

38:27.867 --> 38:30.888
A relationship with love and commitment.

38:33.489 --> 38:34.489
Something physical.

38:36.790 --> 38:38.444
I'll have the same thing.

38:38.445 --> 38:41.700
It's so weird that I dreamed of this very moment.

38:45.701 --> 38:47.555
You would be my girlfriend?

38:48.156 --> 38:48.756
Si.

38:55.057 --> 38:58.555
- I love you darling. - I love you too.

39:01.056 --> 39:03.333
Why did not you bring some champagne to celebrate?

39:03.934 --> 39:06.555
- You wait here. - Insurance.

39:11.356 --> 39:14.333
Boys, Christina and I are together.

39:15.134 --> 39:18.777
- How circus monkeys? - Not together formally.

39:18.778 --> 39:20.999
We have a relationship now.

39:31.200 --> 39:36.222
Congratulations friend, that was the shortest relationship in history.

39:43.523 --> 39:45.555
Johnny, are you busy?

39:45.556 --> 39:49.900
- I'm reading. - I need your services as a cupid.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.900
Trust me. I've been harassed for weeks.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.111
This will be the biggest in history.

40:52.112 --> 40:55.444
You could spend the whole third quarter of girls in school.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.300
Anyone in the mood for an orgy?

40:58.201 --> 41:01.074
Auditions for the cast of the play "Dreams of a Summer Night"

41:01.075 --> 41:03.578
- William Shakespeare. - This could be my big break.

41:03.579 --> 41:05.777
And it was with the girls of the Catholic school.

41:28.578 --> 41:32.111
It seemed an eternity to know if he would spend the third semester at the girls' school.

41:34.712 --> 41:35.712
At last ticket to the glory of Milton.

41:41.113 --> 41:42.666
Eight Locos also were going.

41:43.567 --> 41:47.400
Except he was wrong Garlic auditions.

41:48.601 --> 41:51.555
But gave a bribe to Viking to be director.

41:52.156 --> 41:53.156
A costa del Sr. Lily.

41:59.457 --> 42:02.857
Winter Break.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.999
- Mom? - At home ...

42:09.000 --> 42:11.111
The family barely holding Milton.

42:11.112 --> 42:12.666
My lovely boy!

42:12.667 --> 42:14.222
Grandma had moved home.

42:14.223 --> 42:15.723
Skeletal lights.

42:18.324 --> 42:21.999
Best would feed him if I were you.

42:23.100 --> 42:25.038
Mom's lawyer visited her very often

42:25.039 --> 42:27.111
and there were signs everywhere divorce.

42:32.312 --> 42:35.444
I was forced to leave my room when Grandma came over him.

42:35.845 --> 42:39.666
- Dad moved in with Frank. - Open your eyes.

42:40.467 --> 42:42.777
And his new business venture took shape.

42:45.178 --> 42:47.333
¿Que es F Bag Sad?

42:49.434 --> 42:53.244
Frank bar girls.

42:53.245 --> 42:58.245
F Bag SAD for short. Frank and I have invested everything in it.

43:10.146 --> 43:11.666
Was it a funeral?

43:11.667 --> 43:16.000
It was, but that not be noticed. Frank is a professional.

43:16.701 --> 43:18.888
Look at all this. Look finesse.

43:19.989 --> 43:24.666
Yet to fix that, but look at this.

43:25.567 --> 43:27.188
There will be the stage.

43:27.589 --> 43:34.444
And wait till you see it finished. Frank was killed day and night in this place.

43:38.445 --> 43:42.990
Do not worry, I would not have committed the house and spend all our

43:42.991 --> 43:47.400
sure if he was not sure this is going to be a huge success.

43:49.801 --> 43:53.700
One more thing. Do not tell your mother about this. The concern yourself.

43:54.401 --> 43:57.333
Wait until we start. Frankie!

43:57.834 --> 43:59.777
The great business plan Dad.

44:01.378 --> 44:03.288
- Bye, Mom. - Good luck, Johnny.

44:03.289 --> 44:05.666
Now behave in school girls, my child, okay?

44:05.667 --> 44:07.700
I will. Goodbye, Grandma.

44:07.701 --> 44:10.333
Dale mi amor a Wiston Churchil.

44:10.934 --> 44:13.888
it's okay. See Innosence.

44:13.889 --> 44:16.599
You come back with good.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.777
I see them soon.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.500
I'm sorry your father come so late.

44:26.101 --> 44:29.800
- Sorry, my boy. - It's okay.

44:36.401 --> 44:39.776
Here in St. Catherine's School for Girls

44:39.777 --> 44:43.300
very concerned about discipline and dignity.

44:43.801 --> 44:46.618
Reflecting the will of our founder

44:46.619 --> 44:48.666
Sister Mary Agnes Ingasius.

44:49.567 --> 44:54.333
And today in his honor we raise the flag of the school.

44:54.334 --> 44:57.444
And also the flag of the country.

45:04.645 --> 45:08.899
- 53 - Dale more.

45:08.900 --> 45:12.555
55! 54.

45:12.556 --> 45:15.555
- 54's it. - 54.

45:20.556 --> 45:23.333
Guys, there is.

45:23.334 --> 45:26.579
St. Catherine. The best school for girls in the country.

45:26.580 --> 45:30.600
And welcome to our land men,

45:31.401 --> 45:33.666
Widely open our breasts.

45:37.167 --> 45:38.167
Recemos.

45:39.168 --> 45:42.444
and reminds $ 15 a bottle. Frankie dale.

45:42.845 --> 45:45.900
Elévale 6% by time.

45:47.001 --> 45:48.001
Always a pleasure.

45:49.602 --> 45:52.222
May his spirit clarify their hearts and minds.

45:52.223 --> 45:56.111
Deleting inappropriate thoughts and wild images.

45:59.812 --> 46:02.579
What-? No works the brake.

46:02.580 --> 46:05.222
- I have no brakes! - No no no.

46:05.223 --> 46:07.888
- I told you I revisaras, remember? - What ?!

46:07.889 --> 46:09.489
Use the handbrake.

46:16.490 --> 46:17.490
¡Apártense!

46:29.891 --> 46:30.891
We regret that.

46:41.992 --> 46:43.599
Go first impression!

46:52.800 --> 46:54.177
Your dad is insane.

46:54.178 --> 46:57.888
Christine. This time I will not fall in their mind games.

46:59.589 --> 47:03.788
- See you later? - Definitely.

47:05.222 --> 47:07.989
- Tell me again. - I love you.

47:07.990 --> 47:10.333
What in God's name is going on here?

47:14.134 --> 47:17.333
Great. Bruce Willis has arrived.

47:20.134 --> 47:23.666
I do not like your face, boy, or your dad either.

47:23.667 --> 47:27.666
The Director "Bulldog" Owen. Here it is known only as Mrs. Owen.

47:27.667 --> 47:31.666
If you go to the branch I break like a twig.

47:39.567 --> 47:42.444
The Ms. Owen put us in quarantine from the rest of the school.

47:46.045 --> 47:48.444
Quiet, boy. Where are you going?

47:48.445 --> 47:52.222
- At roof. - No, I saw it first.

47:52.223 --> 47:54.666
Yes me too. Sorry.

47:54.667 --> 47:56.692
Now that Simon and Rambo were favorites

47:56.693 --> 47:58.999
prefects to be better than we thought.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.666
Go to Ocho Locos us.

48:03.167 --> 48:05.499
But I was not the only thing that caused a bad first impression.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.111
For a change, Rambo flirted with art teacher.

48:08.112 --> 48:09.233
Does anyone have any questions?

48:11.834 --> 48:14.111
Sorry, are you busy Friday night?

48:16.212 --> 48:18.777
Simon took an hour and a half to choose her wardrobe.

48:22.078 --> 48:23.078
Give me twenty minutes.

48:24.679 --> 48:29.188
Boggo 372 girls cordially invited to an orgy.

48:32.689 --> 48:33.689
Hello Boggo.

48:35.690 --> 48:37.444
Want some fun?

48:44.045 --> 48:46.888
Fatty fell in love with a girl of 13 years called Penny.

48:46.889 --> 48:49.111
Which is not only against the rules of the school,

48:49.112 --> 48:50.788
also they make you hang in Bulgaria.

48:57.089 --> 49:01.999
The technique of spelling Garlic was misguided ... but continued trying.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.777
It is a great work.

49:04.778 --> 49:09.666
While full of yellow cards Vern locker and surroundings.

49:12.167 --> 49:16.777
- They are reported, girls. - Vern, do you want me delatemos?

49:16.778 --> 49:17.778
Out!

49:20.879 --> 49:23.144
I could only see girls in class.

49:27.645 --> 49:29.800
Simon and Rambo were given the starring roles.

49:30.201 --> 49:32.999
And I fill roles.

49:34.200 --> 49:36.566
Very well done both.

49:38.067 --> 49:40.111
The'm watching everyone.

49:40.912 --> 49:42.578
Especially the perverts.

49:43.679 --> 49:44.679
Lights out.

50:00.480 --> 50:02.111
- Christine? - Hello Friend.

50:02.112 --> 50:03.112
What are you doing here?

50:03.113 --> 50:05.111
They want to get wild tonight?

50:05.112 --> 50:08.222
- We have something planned. - You do not have to ask.

50:08.223 --> 50:10.400
- It is not a good idea. - See you in an hour.

50:10.401 --> 50:11.888
The Ms. Owen is a cannibal.

50:11.889 --> 50:14.233
Come on, guys, we are the Crazy Eight.

50:14.234 --> 50:16.599
This is what we do.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.000
I do not go. I do not feel very well.

50:21.001 --> 50:22.301
Me neither.

50:25.102 --> 50:30.666
They are girls. You wanted to talk to girls. This is your only chance.

50:31.267 --> 50:35.333
- Well, come on. - Come on guys.

50:47.777 --> 50:48.877
Come on, hurry.

50:59.444 --> 51:01.111
In hurry. He's gone. Move.

51:06.512 --> 51:08.788
I am, girl, let us in.

51:10.989 --> 51:11.989
We Arrived.

51:14.590 --> 51:16.539
This is very exciting!

51:18.740 --> 51:21.111
- Watch your head. - Lower your voice.

51:21.112 --> 51:22.112
A fun girls.

51:23.713 --> 51:24.713
Do not make much noise.

51:28.614 --> 51:31.555
- What is this? - Cigarettes.

51:31.856 --> 51:34.222
Oh I get it.

51:36.423 --> 51:37.423
Míralos.

51:54.333 --> 51:55.555
Kiss Me.

52:00.856 --> 52:03.444
Boggo was your turn last year.

52:03.445 --> 52:04.445
What?

52:05.146 --> 52:08.111
You fall from good, Spuddy.

52:09.212 --> 52:11.333
- It Is the alarm. - Run!

52:25.255 --> 52:26.444
Wait. it is clear. Come on.

52:31.666 --> 52:32.555
The catch?

52:34.156 --> 52:37.333
- Sneaking is unacceptable. - What a disappointment.

52:37.334 --> 52:42.000
Disappointed? I'm this close to expel them.

52:42.001 --> 52:43.001
So close.

52:43.602 --> 52:47.444
They should follow the example of Black, Brown and Whiteside.

52:47.445 --> 52:50.333
Now, Go to bed.

52:57.634 --> 53:01.666
- What will happen to you? - I finished the work suspended.

53:03.467 --> 53:04.467
Sorry.

53:06.068 --> 53:08.111
Maybe we can go out on the festivities.

53:09.012 --> 53:11.444
I really want to see Basic attempts.

53:12.245 --> 53:14.444
Itself, would be great.

53:15.345 --> 53:18.666
- You feel bad. - Yes.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.555
I spend something strange last night.

53:25.056 --> 53:26.056
What?

53:26.457 --> 53:31.788
The alarm came from your house.

53:32.989 --> 53:35.788
- Hi guys. - Hello, Mirdel.

53:35.789 --> 53:36.789
Hello, Mirdel.

53:46.590 --> 53:48.222
This sucks.

53:48.223 --> 53:50.423
Simon and Rambo and prefects are created.

53:50.424 --> 53:53.999
- And remember the trials. - Time to do something.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.999
- Let's go for them. - Let's kill.

53:58.800 --> 54:02.499
- Spud? - Yes, I'm in.

54:19.566 --> 54:21.444
All right?

54:22.045 --> 54:23.045
All right.

54:45.333 --> 54:46.777
Lights.

54:47.078 --> 54:49.900
And start, start.

54:54.701 --> 54:56.555
The work started perfectly.

54:59.456 --> 55:01.256
I develop later.

55:01.857 --> 55:03.444
That thought by many laughs.

55:05.245 --> 55:06.777
But it was because they laughed at me.

55:10.178 --> 55:11.666
It's time to face reality, man.

55:11.667 --> 55:13.470
If we are to take revenge on Simon and we Rambo

55:13.471 --> 55:14.999
say goodbye to our chances.

55:15.400 --> 55:18.444
If there are only two places and want to both.

55:20.745 --> 55:23.111
Guys, I have a plan.

55:24.912 --> 55:25.912
Scene five.

55:34.111 --> 55:35.444
Perfect, they have fallen into the network.

55:45.045 --> 55:46.988
That is not in this scene.

56:07.333 --> 56:11.888
Ventílenlo. ¡Ventílenlo!

56:12.989 --> 56:16.888
Ladies and gentlemen, fear not. It's just part of the program.

56:16.889 --> 56:17.889
time.

56:18.590 --> 56:22.666
- Fire Fire! - Fire!

56:26.167 --> 56:27.167
Fire!

56:32.268 --> 56:33.768
I'll kill them!

56:44.569 --> 56:46.666
- Why would you do something so stupid? - Do not touch it.

56:46.667 --> 56:48.888
You idiots ruined the work!

56:48.889 --> 56:52.888
You idiots are so arrogant that they treat us like second class citizens.

56:52.889 --> 56:53.999
Come on, those are tontería-

56:54.000 --> 56:55.600
You are losers.

56:58.201 --> 56:59.201
High!

56:59.902 --> 57:02.000
You bastards ruined my show!

57:02.001 --> 57:08.188
If one evidence that this was intentional, I will drive out all appears.

57:08.989 --> 57:11.888
Good luck in the army.

57:15.389 --> 57:18.111
You See? This is exactly what happens when you break the covenant.

57:18.112 --> 57:21.788
To break the pact? This has nothing to do with your covenant!

57:21.789 --> 57:24.111
I know you touched the alarm and betrayed us!

57:24.112 --> 57:27.111
Do not you dare! We were locked inside.

57:27.112 --> 57:32.144
The alarm is out, how we would sound the alarm if you think you're so smart?

57:32.745 --> 57:36.666
- And we do not put it in the back. - Then who did?

57:36.967 --> 57:39.777
Norman Whiteside.

57:42.378 --> 57:43.378
Good luck friend.

57:43.479 --> 57:44.479
Thanks, buddy.

57:54.880 --> 57:56.300
The eight locos are finished.

57:56.301 --> 57:57.501
Forever.

58:10.402 --> 58:14.111
I cover myself with glory same theater. Volverme prefect.

58:23.812 --> 58:24.812
Lights out.

58:33.113 --> 58:38.888
Summer Vacation.

58:38.889 --> 58:40.888
Welcome home boy.

58:40.889 --> 58:44.111
- What you are? - Dad, you open in three days.

58:44.112 --> 58:47.000
- Yes. - Then why everything is empty?

58:47.001 --> 58:50.222
We have a small problem with the liquor license.

58:50.223 --> 58:54.111
- What is the problem? - Policies.

58:55.812 --> 59:00.023
- Okay, what about the food? - Electrical problems in the kitchen.

59:00.824 --> 59:05.999
- Damn it, do not do this! - And the tables?

59:06.000 --> 59:09.566
Which would bring us has not arrived.

59:09.867 --> 59:12.111
- Hey, Johnny. - Hello, Frank.

59:12.812 --> 59:16.188
Everything will be fine. It is his girlfriend. Do not worry. You're better than her.

59:16.189 --> 59:19.244
You're better than her. We will take until you overcome this.

59:20.145 --> 59:21.888
- It's a disaster. - It will be recalled.

59:21.889 --> 59:25.350
Frank? This place! Invested our family and everything

59:25.351 --> 59:29.000
what we have in a place without alcohol, without electricity.

59:29.001 --> 59:30.777
- For now. - No tables.

59:30.778 --> 59:32.566
- Hopeless. - I know it looks a mess.

59:34.467 --> 59:37.111
- What is that? - Mom asked me to give it to you.

59:37.112 --> 59:40.588
- What is that? - The divorce papers.

59:43.089 --> 59:48.373
Tell him if he wants to ask the divorce to come

59:48.374 --> 59:53.333
Friday night and do it on my face.

59:57.634 --> 01:00:00.000
Your father never ceases to amaze.

01:00:00.001 --> 01:00:03.333
All we got. Everything! To drink it?

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:07.700
Yes I'll be there Friday night.

01:00:07.701 --> 01:00:10.555
To give you this.

01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:23.333
I could not save my scholarship, but I'll be damned if I can not save my family.

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:28.400
Innosence, I need your help.

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:59.800
It is best to go straight to the point, is not it?

01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:19.199
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the grand opening of our Bar.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.429
A special thanks to Amber for providing

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.999
furniture and reduce costs.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.189
Give him a big round of applause.

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:40.190
Innosence also brought people,

01:01:40.191 --> 01:01:43.999
snacks, not to mention the drinks.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.444
Although an unexpected charge percentage of the profits.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:59.444
But there are other special people whom I thank.

01:01:59.445 --> 01:02:01.677
First my son, Johnny.

01:02:01.678 --> 01:02:06.555
It is more talented than you think or even dream.

01:02:12.956 --> 01:02:15.300
And to my beautiful wife and love of my life.

01:02:16.101 --> 01:02:20.444
More than anything in the world. Without you, none of this would be worthwhile.

01:02:26.245 --> 01:02:27.245
I love you, baby.

01:02:50.111 --> 01:02:51.444
Free drinks, on the house!

01:03:24.045 --> 01:03:26.677
- Hey, Johnny. - Hello, siren.

01:03:27.578 --> 01:03:31.900
- Where was your partner? - He Said this place was unworthy.

01:03:33.401 --> 01:03:34.101
Thank You.

01:03:46.402 --> 01:03:50.000
- I miss you. - I also.

01:03:53.501 --> 01:03:54.501
Come with me.

01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:02.589
I love these shots.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.999
Do you know that I want?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Wait.

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:24.555
Last period.

01:04:24.956 --> 01:04:25.956
Your boy.

01:04:25.957 --> 01:04:29.341
After a thorough investigation but useless

01:04:29.342 --> 01:04:33.646
disaster in the school play, Viking reluctantly dropped the charges

01:04:33.647 --> 01:04:38.200
serious sabotage, arson and disrespect to Shakespeare.

01:04:38.901 --> 01:04:43.144
But Ocho Locos were gone.

01:04:48.645 --> 01:04:51.500
The Head and the librarian were madly in love.

01:04:51.501 --> 01:04:57.444
I should use my constant use phrases like jokes ...

01:05:01.345 --> 01:05:02.345
I mean I can kill bats with a ...

01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:09.111
And my school days are numbered.

01:05:09.112 --> 01:05:11.999
Unless kick perfect scores in my exams.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.888
Defies logic.

01:05:17.389 --> 01:05:22.666
How does a human mind can pull rope 5 "A ?? s ?? and failing a field.

01:05:22.667 --> 01:05:25.788
Sorry, sir, is my mess.

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:29.500
You're running out of options, Milton.

01:05:30.001 --> 01:05:31.001
Yes sir.

01:05:43.602 --> 01:05:44.602
It is illegal, my friend.

01:05:44.603 --> 01:05:47.999
- Hello? - Hello Dad.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Hey, boy, how are you?

01:05:50.001 --> 01:05:52.222
I'm good, thanks, how are you?

01:05:52.223 --> 01:05:54.589
This is going well.

01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:55.990
You should see the weekend.

01:05:57.191 --> 01:06:03.555
While watching, we will not cash in at least six months.

01:06:03.556 --> 01:06:06.777
So I need you to hold far as you can with the grant.

01:06:07.678 --> 01:06:11.500
Yes, I will do my best.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.688
Okay, my child, see you then.

01:06:14.489 --> 01:06:16.444
Okay, he called you then.

01:06:16.445 --> 01:06:18.000
- I love you. - I love you.

01:06:18.301 --> 01:06:20.400
- See you. - Yes bye.

01:06:25.201 --> 01:06:28.103
Do you hear that? It is the sound of renewals

01:06:28.104 --> 01:06:30.400
Room prefects.

01:06:31.201 --> 01:06:33.689
It is time to remind you that the choice of the next

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.555
prefects will take place next Thursday.

01:06:39.556 --> 01:06:44.111
Each of you will have three minutes to present their petition to the house.

01:06:44.112 --> 01:06:46.777
After which voting will take place.

01:06:46.778 --> 01:06:51.111
And my decision will rely heavily on those results.

01:06:53.812 --> 01:06:56.187
It's a total waste of time. We all know

01:06:56.188 --> 01:06:58.200
Simon and Rambo are the prefects.

01:06:58.601 --> 01:06:59.937
And the effort is being put Viking

01:06:59.938 --> 01:07:01.444
because obviously he remains the head of the house.

01:07:01.445 --> 01:07:05.288
This is not a democracy. This would never happen in Malawian.

01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:07.999
We should simply accept the facts and accept it.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.722
We will not be prefects. Who cares anyway?

01:07:12.923 --> 01:07:15.888
Only Rambo and Simon worked in his speeches.

01:07:15.889 --> 01:07:18.209
And I started counting towards the end.

01:07:36.888 --> 01:07:37.397
What's up?

01:07:37.398 --> 01:07:39.788
Whiteside has been appointed Head of the school.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:40.989
And what does?

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.933
It means someone else has to be named

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.444
Head of the house. Whiteside could not be both.

01:07:44.445 --> 01:07:45.445
What?

01:07:45.446 --> 01:07:48.111
Jesus, man, no wonder you reprobaras math!

01:07:48.112 --> 01:07:50.300
It means another open prefect place.

01:07:50.301 --> 01:07:52.444
- Where are you going? - To prepare my nominating speech.

01:07:58.045 --> 01:07:59.045
Good morning sir.

01:08:49.999 --> 01:08:50.999
Boss?

01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:12.332
¿Johnny!

01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:17.734
What's up?

01:09:18.135 --> 01:09:20.700
I think I'm locked for writing, sir.

01:09:22.901 --> 01:09:26.111
Funny, I did not expect that.

01:09:26.112 --> 01:09:29.555
What you crave wine to drink?

01:09:30.555 --> 01:09:34.899
- The one who is stronger, sir. - Speaking as a young man.

01:09:36.001 --> 01:09:42.221
By the way, I just received a letter breaking the library

01:09:42.622 --> 01:09:43.923
Sorry, sir.

01:09:45.823 --> 01:09:47.999
He was too old for me anyway.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.300
He never read the books that I like.

01:09:55.201 --> 01:09:57.999
And what is your story?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.822
It is the discourse to choose prefect, sir.

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:06.000
I think everything I write sounds so ... funny.

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:10.400
Well, listen to me, you will not be ready.

01:10:10.801 --> 01:10:13.499
- No notes. - What am I going to say?

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.111
Important things.

01:10:15.112 --> 01:10:16.112
From here.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:21.788
My scholarship is at stake.

01:10:22.589 --> 01:10:24.111
Afraid to lose without remedy.

01:10:24.112 --> 01:10:28.187
Do not try to impress anyone, just stand in front

01:10:28.188 --> 01:10:31.800
and show them what you showed me.

01:10:32.801 --> 01:10:39.400
That's it. I just lost my wife and I will not lose my best friend.

01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:45.444
Not as friends.

01:10:45.445 --> 01:10:50.199
There are friends of friends. The good are forever.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:52.100
Like these.

01:10:58.301 --> 01:10:59.301
The books.

01:11:01.302 --> 01:11:02.302
Librarians.

01:11:08.203 --> 01:11:10.333
Her loss.

01:11:20.334 --> 01:11:21.334
Pass.

01:11:43.335 --> 01:11:46.721
I remind them they need three votes. One to head home.

01:11:46.722 --> 01:11:48.600
And two prefects.

01:11:48.601 --> 01:11:50.666
May the best man win.

01:11:55.067 --> 01:11:56.067
Robert Black.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.333
I'll be honest with you. I will review all their votes.

01:12:16.334 --> 01:12:21.333
And voice to marry each of you who do not vote for me.

01:12:21.634 --> 01:12:23.034
And I will kill him.

01:12:32.835 --> 01:12:33.835
Simón Brown.

01:12:37.336 --> 01:12:43.403
How are you guys? I've been three years in the tennis team,

01:12:43.404 --> 01:12:49.278
Squash, golf. And I'm also good with women, you know.

01:12:55.179 --> 01:12:56.444
¡Porno gratis!

01:13:01.045 --> 01:13:07.999
If you vote for me, I swear I will improve the quality of the food from the kitchen 150%

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.555
Thank you, Blackadder.

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.999
Next, John Milton.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.444
This morning when I thought about what I was going to talk about today,

01:14:21.445 --> 01:14:25.222
I was not quite sure where to start.

01:14:27.023 --> 01:14:32.777
I was told to speak from the heart instead of writing something.

01:14:39.678 --> 01:14:45.666
For me this whole choose our governors from home seems evil.

01:14:46.467 --> 01:14:53.444
Tempt, they seduce you and not really because you know.

01:14:57.045 --> 01:14:59.233
Becomes friends against friends.

01:15:00.434 --> 01:15:05.888
Earlier this year, the school told me to take away my scholarship.

01:15:06.689 --> 01:15:12.111
And if I did not return prefect of the house she had to leave school.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.012
I broke a pact.

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:20.677
A pact that divided my friends.

01:15:23.478 --> 01:15:27.111
Try to stand on my own and prove my worth.

01:15:32.312 --> 01:15:36.888
But the reason I wanted to stay here is not about education.

01:15:41.089 --> 01:15:42.089
It is for them.

01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:45.090
For you.

01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:52.144
At the end of the day are not your accomplishments that make you who you are.

01:15:53.245 --> 01:15:54.645
They are your friends.

01:16:00.146 --> 01:16:02.666
That and what you have here.

01:16:03.367 --> 01:16:05.999
Thank you very much for listening.

01:16:30.111 --> 01:16:31.222
Vote for Spud.

01:17:00.133 --> 01:17:04.178
Have you considered joining the ministry?

01:17:04.179 --> 01:17:06.544
I can not say yes, sir.

01:17:07.545 --> 01:17:09.900
Shame. Well, gentlemen.

01:17:09.901 --> 01:17:13.999
Today we very proud Mr.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.500
Walk as Christian soldiers.

01:17:40.701 --> 01:17:43.444
Fatty says everything with God is a matter of appearances.

01:17:43.845 --> 01:17:47.222
But he was not so committed.

01:18:06.623 --> 01:18:08.396
For the first time since I can remember, voice

01:18:08.397 --> 01:18:10.333
emergency in my head was silent.

01:18:11.034 --> 01:18:13.333
Perhaps by being giving up my faith.

01:18:21.034 --> 01:18:25.555
Now I am pleased to announce the prefects for 1993.

01:18:25.556 --> 01:18:30.999
The home Larsen, head of the house Chris Roche.

01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:41.333
I did not know how to say goodbye, so I did not.

01:18:44.234 --> 01:18:46.500
Last but not the least, the home of the founders.

01:18:47.601 --> 01:18:49.444
Head of the House, Simon Brown

01:18:53.245 --> 01:18:55.888
Felicidades, Brown.

01:19:00.289 --> 01:19:02.589
Prefects. Robert Black.

01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:07.788
Well done, my boy.

01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:20.344
And the final prefect.

01:19:26.045 --> 01:19:27.045
John Milton.

01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:34.446
John Milton.

01:19:39.647 --> 01:19:46.477
¡Spud! ¡Spud! ¡Spud!
¡Spud! ¡Spud! ¡Spud!

01:19:48.878 --> 01:19:51.300
¡Milton, rápido!

01:19:51.301 --> 01:19:54.122
¡Spud! ¡Spud! ¡Spud!

01:20:17.923 --> 01:20:23.444
And Milton is a more deserving of a scholarship once.

01:20:25.845 --> 01:20:28.999
I hope you continue to surprise everyone, including yourself.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.900
With pleasure, sir.

01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:57.888
I can not explain it. Just I know that it is a universal law.

01:21:01.589 --> 01:21:04.899
You want something with all your strength from the depths of the heart.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.400
Stay away from what you've learned and find out what's inside of you.

01:21:14.901 --> 01:21:16.301
What sets you free.
