01:43.167 --> 01:45.958
THE WILD PEAR TREE

02:26.125 --> 02:27.625
Sinan. How are you?

02:27.750 --> 02:28.542
Fine, thanks.

02:28.667 --> 02:29.792
Come in for some tea.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.375
Not now. I need to get home.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.417
The house won't fly away!

02:34.542 --> 02:36.292
I've got all my bags.

02:36.417 --> 02:37.625
Where you been?

02:37.750 --> 02:40.830
College in Qanakkale. I graduated.

02:40.208 --> 02:42.958
No way! Congratulations!

02:43.830 --> 02:43.875
Thanks.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.667
So, what's it like there?

02:46.792 --> 02:48.958
It sucks,
like everywhere if you're broke.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.625
Sure. No money, no life.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.458
Exactly.

02:52.542 --> 02:54.125
Are your folks OK?

02:54.250 --> 02:56.708
I guess. I'll soon find out.

02:56.833 --> 02:57.750
Sinan.

02:57.875 --> 02:58.917
Yes?

03:00.875 --> 03:02.917
I lent your dad

03:03.208 --> 03:05.167
three gold coins.

03:05.292 --> 03:07.542
Four months ago.
He must've forgotten.

03:07.708 --> 03:09.417
-Did you know?
-No.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.625
-He didn't pay you back?
-No. I mentioned it.

03:12.750 --> 03:16.420
I guess he forgot again.
Can you remind him?

03:16.167 --> 03:19.830
Gold is cheap right now
so he’d end up paying less.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.708
OK, I'll tell him.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.542
I can never get him on his cell.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.333
You're right, he's bad with phones.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.167
He's hard to contact.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.792
Does he still have
that hunting dog?

03:31.917 --> 03:33.708
I'm not sure. Why?

03:33.833 --> 03:36.708
I'd take it instead, but he refused.

03:36.875 --> 03:39.583
Don't waste your breath.
He'd refuse millions for it.

03:39.708 --> 03:41.208
But he never goes hunting.

03:41.333 --> 03:44.250
He's very attached to that dog.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.667
OK, have a good day.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.625
-Tell him I said hello.
-I will.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.625
And to drop by.

03:49.750 --> 03:50.833
OK.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.375
Your hands are shaking.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.833
I’m stressed.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.416
I don’t like What’s going on.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.420
Sorry, Nisan,
you're fleeing reality

04:26.830 --> 04:29.420
You’re hiding your head
in the sand.

04:30.667 --> 04:33.333
What's up? Have you eaten?

04:33.458 --> 04:34.625
Yes.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.000
I know.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.500
Well, well!

04:42.750 --> 04:43.792
Welcome.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.792
Thanks.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.333
You just arrived?

04:46.458 --> 04:47.750
No, a while ago.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.375
You, a graduate!

04:49.833 --> 04:51.420
Well done!

04:51.792 --> 04:52.917
Thanks.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.292
How's it going there? Everything OK?

04:55.792 --> 04:57.292
Nothing new.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.625
But Mum's put away my books.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.125
She would.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.125
She hates clutter.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.830
Where did books get you?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.875
Don't get me started.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.917
Restore visible shine and softness
In only one month.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.417
Restructuring night spray
from our time therapy...

05:34.542 --> 05:36.333
Give me the remote.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.667
Our series is about to start.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.500
So?

05:41.792 --> 05:43.625
We'll go back when it starts.

05:44.420 --> 05:47.420
Who wants to watch hours of ads?

05:48.830 --> 05:50.917
Sinan, come and see
what your aunt sent us.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.333
From Aunty?

06:01.333 --> 06:03.250
Look at those goats!

06:03.375 --> 06:06.792
That's a year-old goat?
More like a bull!

06:06.917 --> 06:10.542
Stuffed with goddam feed in a pen!

06:11.830 --> 06:14.125
Imagine what the milk and meat
taste like.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.000
You'd never get enough grass
for a herd that size.

06:18.375 --> 06:22.208
Are you mad? The earth is generous enough
to provide for all.

06:23.167 --> 06:26.333
"Do not scorn the soil
Haven to many treasures"

06:26.458 --> 06:29.333
"Resting place of saints
Home to a thousand prophets"

06:29.458 --> 06:30.625
Yunus Emre!

06:30.750 --> 06:31.917
Bravo!

06:32.125 --> 06:35.583
I should be retiring soon.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.792
With my bonus
I'll show you how to raise animals.

06:38.917 --> 06:40.167
Of course!

06:40.292 --> 06:43.750
We couldn't think how to spend it.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.420
You splashed out on horses

06:46.167 --> 06:49.292
so the rest may as well
go on sheep and goats.

06:49.417 --> 06:52.208
What a family of animal lovers!

06:54.875 --> 06:57.583
Yasemin! Go fetch my jacket.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.875
It's behind you. Get it yourself.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.417
It's because it's behind me
I want you to get it.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.208
Were you eating onions?

07:19.750 --> 07:21.125
Not at all.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.542
Funny, it smells like it.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.917
Anyway.
Have some mint gum and it’ll go.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.667
For God's sake, Dad!

07:31.792 --> 07:33.125
You scared me!

07:33.250 --> 07:34.583
Good, wasn't it?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.208
Hilarious.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.750
It made me laugh.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.542
I confiscated it this morning.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.458
A student had it.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.917
Why keep it?

07:48.420 --> 07:50.167
You could have given it back.

07:50.542 --> 07:53.250
Why do that?
He'd just bring it back.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.250
I’m going to get some air.

07:58.750 --> 07:59.792
Sinan!

08:00.542 --> 08:02.167
If you're going out,

08:02.917 --> 08:05.833
fill the tank,
we'll drive to the village tomorrow.

08:05.958 --> 08:07.542
We can finish the well.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.000
What's the rush? I'm just back.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.542
I can't do it alone.
I need a hand.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.917
The tyres are flat, too.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
What'll we do?

08:20.125 --> 08:23.420
Inflate them a bit when you fill up.

08:23.167 --> 08:24.958
That'll do a few days.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.958
Ask Nazif to help you.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.625
Here, take this.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.000
-Will that cover it?
-
t'
have to.

08:33.125 --> 08:36.500
It will. We can cut the engine
going downhill.

08:41.917 --> 08:44.000
Now lift! C'mon!

08:44.292 --> 08:45.125
My foot!

08:45.250 --> 08:48.458
What's your foot doing there?

08:48.750 --> 08:50.792
Lift it when I tell you.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.830
-But it won't budge.
-Move.

08:53.208 --> 08:54.708
Where's the end of the rope?

08:54.833 --> 08:57.000
Here. Hold tight.

09:00.958 --> 09:01.917
Pull!

09:31.375 --> 09:33.458
You can see nothing in the dark.

09:33.708 --> 09:36.167
You see this rock?

09:36.375 --> 09:38.958
Take the rock and the rope.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.208
Slip the rope under the rock.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.958
Tie it off at the top

09:45.167 --> 09:46.917
and slip it back under.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.830
I'm trying to help
and you don't give damn.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.542
Not true.

10:05.667 --> 10:08.792
I was just moving it
so we didn't tread on it.

10:08.917 --> 10:09.792
Listen.

10:09.917 --> 10:12.917
I help despite my bad back
and you mess about.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.292
Dad, I came all the way from Qan.
Sinan too.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.500
A quick job but you take forever.

10:18.958 --> 10:21.458
Dad, you can't finish a well
without finding water.

10:21.583 --> 10:23.830
Water?

10:23.208 --> 10:24.292
Here?

10:24.417 --> 10:26.542
You're really stubborn!

10:26.667 --> 10:29.208
You know my field better than me?

10:29.417 --> 10:30.583
Good God!

10:32.833 --> 10:37.125
People laugh their asses off
at these idiot schemes of yours!

10:37.250 --> 10:39.420
Based on science, is it?

10:39.167 --> 10:41.958
Your divining rod told you?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.958
I've spent my life here.

10:44.830 --> 10:46.583
And you know better
if there's water here?

10:47.208 --> 10:50.708
I agreed to help
just to shut people up.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.583
And you screw up again.

10:52.708 --> 10:55.958
Why do you employ that retard Ahmet?

10:56.830 --> 10:57.667
Everyone's laughing at you.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.708
Because he was free.

10:59.833 --> 11:03.167
I paid him, too. Unlike the others.

11:03.417 --> 11:06.417
You could have built
a building in this time.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.830
If I was you, I'd keep quiet.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.250
What an idea!

11:13.375 --> 11:14.833
Find water

11:14.958 --> 11:16.708
and turn the place green!

11:16.875 --> 11:19.830
Grandad, wait! Where are you going?

11:19.208 --> 11:22.167
There are frogs but no water?
Where’s your brain?

11:22.250 --> 11:24.958
Forget it. He can't hear you.

11:25.420 --> 11:27.417
I know.
I'm taking advantage of that.

11:27.542 --> 11:28.833
Why did he come?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.420
-Did you ask him?
-No.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.208
It's him.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.417
He hovers above me
like the sword of Damocles.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.000
Arap!

11:42.125 --> 11:44.333
Are you sleeping?

11:44.458 --> 11:48.792
I hate leaving you with him,
but I've no choice just now.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.420
Just hang in there.

11:51.167 --> 11:53.125
I'll be retiring soon.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.792
Then we'll be together here.

11:56.125 --> 11:57.500
-What are we doing now?

11:57.625 --> 11:58.417
Huh?

11:58.625 --> 11:59.667
Now?

12:00.125 --> 12:02.583
We'll do it better ourselves.

12:03.167 --> 12:05.125
They think it’s about brute force.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.500
What are you doing, Grandad?

12:32.958 --> 12:35.708
Don't lift that with your back!

12:36.125 --> 12:37.958
Fucking weasels!

12:38.458 --> 12:40.458
They never stop pestering us.

12:40.875 --> 12:43.667
We used to shoot them for their pelts.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.000
Nobody cares now.

12:46.167 --> 12:47.458
Doesn't the dog help?

12:47.583 --> 12:50.420
Your dad's dog?
No chance.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.708
These shits choke the chickens,
suck their blood

12:54.833 --> 12:56.542
and carry off what's left.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.833
Like vampires?

12:59.792 --> 13:01.875
Why did you run off?
It wasn't the frog.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.500
Of course not.

13:03.792 --> 13:05.000
He pisses me off.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.750
Why let him?
Just don't give a damn.

13:07.875 --> 13:10.500
It's hard not to get annoyed.

13:10.708 --> 13:14.208
He's only amusing himself.
He'll never finish.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.375
So leave him to it.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.792
Take it easy.

13:17.917 --> 13:20.625
Let him have his fun. And have fun too.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.292
When he was a baby we forgot him
sleeping in a field.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.875
We found him covered in ants.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.667
Is that why he's like this?

13:29.792 --> 13:31.420
No, C'mon.

13:31.292 --> 13:34.500
But for days
he had ants coming out of his nose.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.417
No, it’s not about that, but...

13:38.125 --> 13:40.250
That old cupboard in the cellar.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.708
Is it still there?

13:42.833 --> 13:44.708
No idea. Ask Grandma.

13:46.542 --> 13:48.000
Grandma's dead, Grandad.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.167
What about the cupboard?

13:53.292 --> 13:55.750
It's full of old newspapers,

13:55.875 --> 13:58.625
ads, notices, all that.

13:59.292 --> 14:01.500
He tied two plastic bottles together

14:01.667 --> 14:03.458
and stuck them in the hollow of a tree.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.708
What for? The sun heats the water.

14:06.833 --> 14:09.667
Then he can wash his hands in hot water.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.292
Look at his shitty ideas!

15:09.625 --> 15:12.250
-How's it going?
-Sinan, come in.

15:12.417 --> 15:15.750
No, thanks, Gran. Mum sent you this.

15:15.875 --> 15:19.000
The pots are yours.
And there's a few pastries.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.708
Come in, C'mon.

15:20.833 --> 15:22.667
No, I have things to do.

15:22.792 --> 15:23.667
Are you hungry?

15:23.792 --> 15:25.958
Don't stand there. Come in.

15:26.830 --> 15:26.958
No, Grandpa.

15:27.830 --> 15:28.583
I've made pancakes.

15:28.708 --> 15:29.583
I'm going.

15:29.708 --> 15:31.625
Did you come on your own?

15:32.208 --> 15:34.167
No, with Dad.

15:34.292 --> 15:35.583
He's in the field.

15:36.420 --> 15:39.458
-What's he up to now?
-Working on the well.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.458
The never-ending saga.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.250
Where's your dad?

15:43.375 --> 15:44.500
In the field.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.958
In the field. Digging a well!

15:47.420 --> 15:48.750
Isn't that done yet?

15:48.875 --> 15:50.500
No, Grandpa!

15:50.625 --> 15:52.830
It'll never be done.

15:52.208 --> 15:52.958
Of course not.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.583
I told him there's no water there.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.333
Why a well on that hill?

15:57.667 --> 16:00.208
He wants to turn the place green.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.875
You know him.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.830
He's got lots of debts again. You heard?

16:04.208 --> 16:05.917
Yes, Mum said.

16:06.420 --> 16:09.792
She said you helped out again.
Thanks.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.917
What else could we do?

16:12.420 --> 16:13.958
-Did you mention the teacher?
-Who?

16:14.830 --> 16:15.625
The teacher. Did she tell you?

16:15.750 --> 16:17.208
Slow down, will you?

16:17.333 --> 16:18.625
What's this?

16:19.583 --> 16:22.750
You know that bald teacher?
An old friend of your dad's.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.500
He came with his wife the other day.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.917
Muharrem. And?

16:27.420 --> 16:30.542
Said he lent him some gold a year ago

16:30.667 --> 16:32.167
and can't get it back.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.333
-So why's he telling you?
-No idea.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.292
A real Chatterbox.

16:37.417 --> 16:41.000
It was his wife's gold,
their son's getting married...

16:41.125 --> 16:43.583
-You didn't give him anything, did you?
-No.

16:43.708 --> 16:47.375
Don't! He's a total crook.
It’s him who got Dad into the horses.

16:47.458 --> 16:50.542
Is that a reason
not to give back his gold?

16:50.667 --> 16:53.208
They can do what they like.
I don’t care.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.829
Go on through.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.420
MAYOR

17:25.791 --> 17:28.416
-What was your surname?
-Karasu.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.830
Ah, yes. Here it is.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.750
Sinan Karasu.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.417
Yes.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.792
-Are you Gasman Cumhur’s son?
-No.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.875
But I know him.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.958
We just have the same surname.

17:44.830 --> 17:45.958
Who's your father? What does he do?

17:46.830 --> 17:48.458
-He's a teacher, too.
-Where? Here?

17:48.583 --> 17:49.500
Yes, here.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.375
What's his name?

17:51.958 --> 17:53.208
Idris.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.375
So you're Idris' son?

17:57.583 --> 17:58.750
Yes.

18:05.958 --> 18:07.500
My manuscript's ready.

18:08.375 --> 18:12.000
But as you know,
publishing a book isn't easy.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.958
You have to find funding.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.125
It's not easy.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.958
I thought about
going to the regional council

18:21.830 --> 18:24.167
but trying my own town first
felt more right.

18:25.917 --> 18:28.458
see swashbucklers here.
Do you talk about them?

18:28.583 --> 18:30.333
I do.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.875
-And Wildpear.
-Yes.

18:33.167 --> 18:35.420
Few people know it. Bravo.

18:35.167 --> 18:36.830
Thanks.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.292
My brother did his army service there,
that's how I know.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.625
And the old gravestones.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.917
Yes.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.750
Just above Lake Van.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.500
But sorry Mr Adnan.

18:48.625 --> 18:52.420
I'm not talking about the place,
but the wild pear tree.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.500
What?

18:53.792 --> 18:57.167
You know, wild pear trees.
Those gnarled, stunted trees?

18:57.292 --> 18:59.833
That's the wild pear in my book.

18:59.958 --> 19:01.420
Ah, right.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.292
Not everyone knows that either.

19:03.583 --> 19:07.375
Even though the place
is full of wild pear trees.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.500
By the way,

19:11.750 --> 19:15.583
don’t think of it
as a tourist guide or fact-based book.

19:15.708 --> 19:16.458
Of course,

19:16.583 --> 19:19.875
this place inspired me
but these are personal writings

19:20.000 --> 19:22.625
fictionalised in a literary way.

19:23.625 --> 19:27.875
In a way,
these are intimate confessions

19:28.000 --> 19:31.208
free of the influence
of any faith, ideology or authority.

19:31.750 --> 19:36.333
You mean something freestyle
with a kind of personal look?

19:38.830 --> 19:38.875
Kind of.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.667
Something like that.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.583
Well, good. Good for you.

19:43.708 --> 19:44.833
Thanks.

19:44.958 --> 19:49.000
Publishing the texts as a book
is really important to me.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.833
Yes, of course it is. Very important.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.958
Sorry to show up
with no appointment.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.583
-I don't want to waste your time.
-No, don't say that.

19:58.708 --> 20:00.917
Don't think that, really.

20:01.420 --> 20:02.208
Don't.

20:02.708 --> 20:05.208
Did you notice the door
on your way in?

20:05.333 --> 20:07.417
-That door?
-Yes.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.000
Yes.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.167
There isn't one.

20:12.292 --> 20:14.667
That's right, there isn't.

20:14.750 --> 20:15.917
Do you know why not?

20:16.417 --> 20:20.458
Because my first act in office
was to take that door out.

20:20.625 --> 20:21.708
Do you know why?

20:24.292 --> 20:26.333
Because my door is always open.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.000
I've nothing to hide from anyone.

20:30.292 --> 20:32.958
Keeping the public at arm's length
is history.

20:33.830 --> 20:37.542
Democracy is something
that breathes and grows all the time.

20:37.667 --> 20:41.625
Retreating behind thick walls,
being accountable to no one

20:41.750 --> 20:43.792
scheming away in private,

20:43.917 --> 20:46.333
it's just not ethical.

20:46.583 --> 20:50.750
We’ve always stood by workers,
by people in trouble.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.958
And we'll continue that way.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.125
Then pass the baton to you, the young.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.917
It's basically a relay race, right?

20:57.625 --> 20:59.375
Definitely.

21:02.542 --> 21:05.625
Now, how much did you say you needed?

21:09.375 --> 21:11.333
Around 2000 lira in all.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.000
It's not just the printing.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.875
There's distribution, publicity, tax.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.500
So it’s no big deal.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.333
No.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.792
2000 is nothing.

21:21.917 --> 21:22.625
I agree.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.125
It's nothing.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.583
That's right.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.833
That's for 500 copies.

21:27.958 --> 21:30.875
The price goes up if you want more.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.917
A guy from the village
works at the printer's,

21:34.830 --> 21:36.417
so he got me a good price.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.333
As you say, it's not much.

21:39.458 --> 21:40.458
Really not.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.708
Although that said...

21:42.833 --> 21:44.250
I'm afraid

21:44.333 --> 21:48.000
we can't take money like that
from the council budget.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.167
Legally, we can't

21:50.292 --> 21:53.375
directly subsidise an individual.

21:53.875 --> 21:57.583
OK, if it was a scholarly work
or for tourism,

21:57.708 --> 22:01.542
about the War Cemetery
or Troy or Kilitbahir Castle...

22:01.667 --> 22:05.375
we could tap the promotion budget
for as much as you like.

22:05.500 --> 22:09.458
Even then,
there'd be a raft of procedures.

22:10.833 --> 22:11.792
But here,

22:11.917 --> 22:15.542
for a personal memoir
with a general approach,

22:15.667 --> 22:18.917
I'll be honest,
it's a big ask, Sinan.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.000
But I'm not asking you

22:21.125 --> 22:24.417
to sponsor it completely.

22:24.542 --> 22:28.458
It could be a loan
or payment for some work.

22:28.583 --> 22:29.375
No.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.875
It's out of the question.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.667
I'd even collect trash.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.583
That reminds me...

22:37.708 --> 22:40.583
We had a trash collector poet.
Do you know him?

22:40.708 --> 22:41.417
No.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.542
Wait, I'll give you his book
if there are any left.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.458
We learned later

22:48.583 --> 22:50.833
he was a total crook, though.

22:50.958 --> 22:53.375
Fleeced us and vanished.

22:54.792 --> 22:55.542
Osman!

22:58.583 --> 23:01.500
Where are Necati's books?

23:01.625 --> 23:02.667
They were in that cupboard.

23:02.792 --> 23:05.917
I can't see them.
There's just election stuff in there.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.583
Shall I ask Gazanfer?

23:08.708 --> 23:10.750
Yes, go and ask him.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.542
How can we help you then?

23:21.458 --> 23:24.667
Maybe you should talk to Ilhami.

23:25.292 --> 23:28.333
Yes, go and see Ilhami.
He's your man.

23:28.458 --> 23:29.250
Ilhami?

23:29.458 --> 23:32.000
He worked in tourism.
He runs a sand quarry now.

23:32.125 --> 23:34.417
Right behind the mine.

23:34.542 --> 23:38.420
But since it isn't a tourism book...

23:38.167 --> 23:41.333
No. Don't say that.

23:41.917 --> 23:45.917
He reads a lot. He devours books.
You'll see. He has stacks of them.

23:46.420 --> 23:49.333
If anyone can fund you, it's him.

23:49.458 --> 23:50.458
Go and talk to him.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.417
I'll call to say you're coming.

23:52.667 --> 23:53.458
OK, thanks.

23:53.583 --> 23:56.830
I'll drop in on my way past.

23:56.208 --> 23:58.667
Go on, it's his thing.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.208
Lucky I remembered.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.375
Hello.

25:02.583 --> 25:04.420
I'd like to see Mr Ilhami.

25:04.167 --> 25:05.667
He isn't here.

25:05.917 --> 25:08.250
-When will he be back?
-Monday.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.420
What's it about?

25:11.167 --> 25:13.830
Nothing special. Thanks.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.458
Sinan!

25:43.125 --> 25:44.833
It's me. You don't recognize me?

25:44.958 --> 25:45.667
Hatice!

25:45.750 --> 25:47.792
At last!

25:48.167 --> 25:49.833
Have I changed that much?

25:49.958 --> 25:52.417
No, it's the headscarf.

25:53.420 --> 25:54.958
-That confused me.
-Oh, sure.

25:55.830 --> 25:56.500
No, really.

25:57.458 --> 26:00.583
You haven't changed at all.
I recognized you right away.

26:00.792 --> 26:03.375
Head bent, hands in pockets.
Just the same.

26:03.708 --> 26:05.917
Although the glasses are missing.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.500
You haven't changed either.

26:08.625 --> 26:11.250
Well you have. You've grown up.

26:11.917 --> 26:13.292
You mean grown old?

26:13.417 --> 26:14.917
No! Old, at your age?

26:15.420 --> 26:15.833
Well, yes.

26:15.958 --> 26:19.250
I mean changed in a good way.

26:20.167 --> 26:22.250
Fine, if you say so.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.542
-What are you doing here?
-Wandering about.

26:26.625 --> 26:29.625
I had a thing to do over there.

26:30.625 --> 26:31.917
What are you up to?

26:32.420 --> 26:33.292
Not much.

26:33.417 --> 26:36.667
Picking walnuts in the field.
I came to get some water.

26:36.917 --> 26:38.830
Is it your field?

26:38.250 --> 26:40.625
No. We're just helping out.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.458
Great.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.375
-So you're done with college?
-Yes.

26:45.667 --> 26:48.375
Bravo.
So you're going to be a teacher?

26:48.500 --> 26:49.750
I don't know yet.

26:49.875 --> 26:53.000
I have to do more exams.

26:53.125 --> 26:54.417
Depends how it goes.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.333
And your studies?

26:56.667 --> 26:58.833
I stopped after high school.

26:59.375 --> 27:01.830
I guess I heard that.

27:01.208 --> 27:02.542
But why?

27:03.830 --> 27:04.750
Pressure at home?

27:04.875 --> 27:06.792
No. I didn't want to.

27:07.830 --> 27:08.292
How come?

27:09.333 --> 27:11.500
I don't know. I just didn't.

27:12.292 --> 27:13.958
I was fed up with school.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.250
Why are you surprised?

27:20.375 --> 27:21.583
Is it so far out?

27:21.917 --> 27:24.833
Of course not.
I'm not surprised.

27:29.708 --> 27:31.750
So? What are you going to do here?

27:32.208 --> 27:33.583
Well...

27:34.792 --> 27:36.667
Take that exam.

27:36.917 --> 27:41.420
Then get a job
or do my military service, depending.

27:41.167 --> 27:43.830
I don't plan to stay here, though.

27:43.208 --> 27:44.292
Why not?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.420
I don't know, I don't like it here.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.000
All these small-minded,

27:49.292 --> 27:52.542
bigoted people like peas in a pod.

27:54.958 --> 27:57.292
I don't plan to rot here.

27:57.958 --> 28:00.667
Great. Save your skin.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.125
We'll get by.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.250
What do you mean?

28:05.750 --> 28:08.420
We're rotting here, are we?

28:08.167 --> 28:10.542
I didn't mean it like that.

28:10.667 --> 28:13.500
It's harder for guys here, workwise.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.167
Sure, girls just get married
and sit at home.

28:17.292 --> 28:20.000
Did I say that?
You a feminist now?

28:20.125 --> 28:22.708
No, don't worry. No problem.

28:22.875 --> 28:26.417
It's what I want anyway.
Get married, sit at home.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.875
Everything's fine then.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.917
That's it.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.417
It’s a matter of choice.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.458
Got a cigarette?

28:51.500 --> 28:52.542
Yes.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.708
Light one for me, will you?

29:14.958 --> 29:15.958
Follow me.

29:37.917 --> 29:40.667
Did you use to smoke?
I don't remember.

29:40.792 --> 29:42.625
No,
just started.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.417
Fantastic!

29:45.830 --> 29:47.333
The ways of a 40-year addict.

29:48.458 --> 29:50.250
You've become really uptight.

29:58.750 --> 29:59.917
Thanks.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.000
Go on, have a drag.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.667
Is it because it touched my lips?

30:04.833 --> 30:06.292
Don't be ridiculous!

30:26.208 --> 30:28.500
Won't they get worried in the field?

30:30.167 --> 30:31.667
It's fine.

30:38.875 --> 30:41.420
You might find this a bit weird.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.625
But I don't understand why

30:43.750 --> 30:47.208
people have to choose the life nearest them.

30:48.830 --> 30:49.458
They don't.

30:49.958 --> 30:52.250
Anyone who really wants to

30:52.583 --> 30:54.583
will go and live the life they want.

30:54.708 --> 30:57.750
But there are so many
beautiful things out there.

30:57.875 --> 30:58.750
Like what?

30:58.875 --> 31:00.420
Want me to tell you?

31:00.667 --> 31:01.833
Yes.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.833
What do you mean what?

31:05.625 --> 31:08.830
A whole load of things.

31:08.208 --> 31:09.417
Like?

31:11.250 --> 31:12.458
Like...

31:14.583 --> 31:16.958
busy lit-up streets,

31:17.830 --> 31:18.833
windy hills,

31:18.958 --> 31:20.708
nice food.

31:21.917 --> 31:24.542
I've seen them all.
They're nothing special.

31:25.292 --> 31:26.417
What else?

31:28.458 --> 31:30.750
Ships sailing far away,

31:30.875 --> 31:32.792
summer evenings,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.708
being in love, getting drunk,

31:35.833 --> 31:38.208
getting soaked in the rain.

31:39.125 --> 31:42.250
Say it suddenly rained now
and we got soaked...

31:42.375 --> 31:45.375
then we got struck by lightning,
wouldn't that be great?

31:45.958 --> 31:49.208
Hold on, I've a couple of things
to do first.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.333
Everything, life...

31:56.667 --> 31:59.830
seems so close, but it isn't.

32:00.917 --> 32:03.000
Because everything's so far away.

33:07.208 --> 33:08.375
Hatice, what's wrong?

33:09.792 --> 33:12.417
Come here or they'll see you.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.208
Are you crying or what?

33:19.750 --> 33:21.830
What's the matter?

33:23.667 --> 33:25.420
Nothing.

33:28.420 --> 33:30.292
Actually, I'm going soon as well.

33:32.625 --> 33:33.708
You're going?

33:34.500 --> 33:35.458
Where?

33:35.583 --> 33:38.625
Why should it always be you going?
Let us have a turn.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.333
Sure, but...

33:40.792 --> 33:42.875
Where are you going?
I'm curious now.

33:46.500 --> 33:50.420
Somewhere with gold and silver
and stuff.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.958
Treasure Island!

33:53.583 --> 33:54.917
Can I come too?

33:55.420 --> 33:57.542
Maybe not Treasure Island...

33:58.292 --> 34:01.833
but you could say a treasure chamber.

34:24.375 --> 34:29.000
You know that place
they call the house of matrimony?

34:29.750 --> 34:31.667
That's where I'm going.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.792
So you're getting married?

34:41.667 --> 34:43.667
Are you kidding?

34:44.333 --> 34:48.917
-Why would I?
-I don't know. You're weird.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.333
You cry one minute, laugh the next.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.708
But if you're serious, congratulations.

34:55.833 --> 34:59.125
I'm happy for you and for Riza.

35:00.667 --> 35:02.250
Why Riza?

35:02.500 --> 35:03.792
What do you mean?

35:06.750 --> 35:09.542
I'm not about to marry a kid.

35:10.420 --> 35:12.500
So you broke up?

35:13.708 --> 35:15.625
I'm shocked.

35:15.792 --> 35:17.167
Who is it then?

35:19.208 --> 35:20.625
You wouldn't know him.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.333
A jeweller.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.125
OK then, tell me.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.917
Seeing as you read so many books.

35:41.125 --> 35:43.792
Are there scorpions under that gold?

35:43.917 --> 35:45.208
Scorpions?

35:49.417 --> 35:51.625
There are scorpions everywhere.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.250
So should I go into that fancy chamber?

35:57.830 --> 35:59.125
That's up to you.

35:59.250 --> 36:02.375
How can I make such a big decision for you?

36:02.500 --> 36:03.833
For goodness sake!

36:03.917 --> 36:08.125
I just asked your opinion.
There's no need to be so scared.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.167
I'm not scared.

36:13.292 --> 36:14.542
And your heart,

36:15.458 --> 36:17.420
what does it say?

36:17.500 --> 36:19.167
My heart?

36:24.420 --> 36:26.875
When did my heart last say anything?

37:52.792 --> 37:54.125
Hatice!

37:58.125 --> 37:59.458
Where are you?

38:31.625 --> 38:32.333
Hello!

38:32.417 --> 38:34.830
How’s it going, buddy?

38:34.208 --> 38:35.417
Good. How about you?

38:35.542 --> 38:39.167
Same as ever. Surviving. You?

38:39.292 --> 38:41.542
You can imagine.

38:42.792 --> 38:44.583
You coming over?

38:44.958 --> 38:47.830
-I can’t, buddy.
-Why not?

38:47.208 --> 38:49.750
That’s how it is in the police.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.917
-You mean no holiday?
-Exactly.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.250
So where are you?

38:53.375 --> 38:56.250
At home in bed. Are you back in Can?

38:56.542 --> 38:59.917
Yes, I'm back in fucking Qan!

39:02.667 --> 39:03.875
If I was a dictator...

39:04.000 --> 39:07.625
I'd drop an atom bomb
on this fucking place, I swear.

39:08.208 --> 39:09.875
Do you get time off for Eid?

39:10.000 --> 39:14.292
No, if I did, I’d come back.
We’re working.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.417
I'm on guard duty

39:16.583 --> 39:18.875
Aren't you with the riot police?

39:19.000 --> 39:24.830
Yes, but we’re posted around the HQ.

39:24.417 --> 39:26.542
In the middle of the gypsy area.

39:26.917 --> 39:29.625
We're on duty there.

39:29.750 --> 39:32.958
Two days a week.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.833
Otherwise it’s the brigade.

39:35.958 --> 39:38.167
We go if there's trouble.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.125
Is there a lot of trouble?

39:40.250 --> 39:42.420
Do you bash communists?

39:43.417 --> 39:46.542
Man, there's nowhere
as crazy as this fucking place!

39:46.625 --> 39:51.420
It’s land of quiet now,
but two months ago, it was all action.

39:51.167 --> 39:53.000
You're sent if anything happens?

39:53.125 --> 39:55.917
Damn flying.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.583
So what do you do?
Tear gas, water cannons and all that?

39:59.708 --> 40:01.420
Yes, all that.

40:01.167 --> 40:04.500
And anywhere out of sight
we beat them up a bit.

40:04.833 --> 40:07.792
It’s a way of getting back
for being bullied.

40:07.917 --> 40:10.750
Why not?
That's the theory of life.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.333
Everyone takes their stress out
on someone else.

40:13.458 --> 40:15.542
So we went to a university

40:15.667 --> 40:18.167
There is this pint-sized guy
Like Seydi

40:18.292 --> 40:22.333
From some crap socialist league.

40:22.458 --> 40:26.830
He stands in front of me,
I've got my shield

40:26.208 --> 40:29.125
He hits me, What the fuck is this
Then he kicks my shield.

40:29.250 --> 40:31.333
The fucker keeps kicking my shield!

40:31.667 --> 40:36.417
I’m losing it.
Plus, there are cameras all around

40:36.542 --> 40:41.250
When he’s about to kick me again
I bash his fucking head with my shield

40:43.875 --> 40:46.250
He flies like a piece of shit!

40:46.375 --> 40:48.792
Like our full sized Seydi

40:49.875 --> 40:52.708
The world’s a fucking bitch, you know.

40:56.792 --> 41:00.792
You think we have any chance
of getting a teaching job?

41:00.917 --> 41:03.167
I’ve dropped the idea.

41:03.292 --> 41:05.542
But you'll get assigned in February.

41:05.667 --> 41:08.125
But even if I do,
I doubt I could hack it in the east.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.250
Just go I say.

41:10.375 --> 41:12.333
It’s not that bad.

41:12.458 --> 41:14.917
It’s OK for teachers.

41:15.420 --> 41:17.292
The cops and the soldiers get the shit.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.667
What's up?

42:52.458 --> 42:53.417
Seydi!

44:44.458 --> 44:47.667
When we learn
we are not so important...

44:47.792 --> 44:49.750
Why is our instinct to be Huns?

44:50.167 --> 44:54.583
Wouldn’t it be better to treat it?
as a key moment of insight?

44:55.625 --> 45:00.167
We engender our own beliefs.

45:00.292 --> 45:02.833
Thus, we need to believe in separation

45:03.375 --> 45:06.833
as much as in beauty and Love,
and to be prepared

45:07.830 --> 45:11.875
Because rupture and separation
We lie in wait for everything beautiful.

45:12.792 --> 45:17.417
In which case,
Why not treat these tribulations?

45:17.542 --> 45:20.542
as constructive disasters

45:20.667 --> 45:23.792
that help us
pierce our own mysteries.

45:25.420 --> 45:26.000
Fine.

45:27.708 --> 45:29.875
So you can dance for joy now.

45:30.375 --> 45:31.958
-What do you mean?
-C'mon.

45:33.125 --> 45:34.667
Don’t tell me you aren’t pleased.

45:35.583 --> 45:36.708
Why?

45:40.167 --> 45:41.750
Because you broke up?

45:41.833 --> 45:43.125
Exactly.

45:44.542 --> 45:47.417
It's obvious in every word you say.

45:48.375 --> 45:49.458
I can see it.

45:53.830 --> 45:55.830
Maybe you're right.

45:57.830 --> 45:59.792
But that's normal.
It's the same for everybody.

45:59.875 --> 46:02.830
You were all jealous of us.

46:03.958 --> 46:05.208
You think I didn't notice?

46:05.333 --> 46:07.500
Don't give me that bullshit!

46:07.875 --> 46:12.708
It’s you who needed
that cloud of jealousy around you, dickhead.

46:13.625 --> 46:16.000
It was your fucked-up way
of feeling real.

46:16.830 --> 46:20.125
You messed with the girl's head
way back at high school.

46:20.792 --> 46:22.750
Giving her books and stuff.

46:23.420 --> 46:24.417
Those tricky schemes.

46:24.542 --> 46:29.167
Live in La-La land,
ignore the possibility of breaking up.

46:30.420 --> 46:33.167
Then when real life hits home,

46:33.625 --> 46:35.417
just blame other people.

46:38.420 --> 46:41.420
Hatice had wandering eyes for ages.
Didn't you notice?

46:41.167 --> 46:42.833
Liar!

46:46.000 --> 46:48.833
You’re only saying that
because Hatice ignored you...

46:48.958 --> 46:52.417
in spite of all your books
and underhand schemes.

46:54.458 --> 46:56.417
Don't be so damn sure.

46:57.333 --> 46:59.125
Don't be so damn sure.

46:59.875 --> 47:00.875
If you ask me.

47:10.875 --> 47:12.458
Fuck you!

47:12.583 --> 47:14.667
Fuck you! Asshole!

47:14.792 --> 47:16.250
Asshole!

47:17.750 --> 47:20.125
I'm gonna kill you!

48:11.750 --> 48:13.750
Give the boy some money.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.500
I'm talking to you!

48:19.625 --> 48:21.417
He's doing an exam, C'mon.

48:21.958 --> 48:23.958
You joking? What money?

48:24.830 --> 48:26.667
You have my bank card, my wages.

48:26.792 --> 48:30.667
What do you think's left
after I pay your debts?

48:30.792 --> 48:34.420
Get off my back, Asuman!

48:34.125 --> 48:37.792
You could have told me.
I'd have found the money.

48:37.875 --> 48:40.333
What would that change?

48:40.625 --> 48:42.333
What would you have done?

48:42.542 --> 48:44.125
Bet it on a horse!

48:44.250 --> 48:46.830
OK, that'll do.

48:46.208 --> 48:48.830
Stop it! I'll hitchhike.

48:48.208 --> 48:49.833
Wait, I'll be right back.

48:58.917 --> 49:01.000
Don’t you have any money?

49:01.208 --> 49:04.125
Make do for now.
I’ll send some along.

49:04.250 --> 49:06.420
Forget it.

49:06.167 --> 49:07.375
Really?

49:09.958 --> 49:12.542
-Do you have your ID?
-Yes.

49:12.667 --> 49:16.333
I forgot mine once
for a head teacher's exam.

49:16.458 --> 49:18.625
They wouldn't let me in.

49:19.667 --> 49:23.167
Even though the examiner was a pal.

49:23.292 --> 49:26.420
He refused to let me in.

49:26.167 --> 49:28.167
I wouldn't say he was jealous.

49:28.292 --> 49:30.125
He was a good friend.

49:30.333 --> 49:31.708
Here you go.

49:32.292 --> 49:34.458
-Make do with that.
-Thanks.

49:34.583 --> 49:36.167
Good luck.

49:36.292 --> 49:37.125
Thanks.

49:37.250 --> 49:39.875
Call us when you're done.

49:40.000 --> 49:40.875
Good luck!

49:41.000 --> 49:42.375
OK, bye.

49:53.750 --> 49:55.542
God, you walk fast!

49:55.667 --> 49:58.458
I ran and I still couldn't
catch up with you.

49:58.583 --> 50:00.500
What are you doing here?

50:00.625 --> 50:03.417
I thought I'd see you off
at the bus station.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.250
You really don't need to.

50:07.420 --> 50:09.833
It's no big deal.
I'm free today anyway.

50:10.667 --> 50:13.417
Go back.
It's not like I don't know the way.

50:13.542 --> 50:16.417
True, but today is different.

50:17.420 --> 50:20.917
Your fate will be sealed today!
You're taking a state exam!

50:21.830 --> 50:23.708
You might find yourself
in a nice town on the Aegean coast...

50:23.833 --> 50:27.125
or a remote snowbound village
in the East.

50:27.250 --> 50:29.833
Don't knock the East.

50:29.958 --> 50:33.292
Even there, it's not easy these days.

50:33.667 --> 50:36.167
I know it isn't.

50:36.667 --> 50:38.917
What do you need to do? Work!

50:39.250 --> 50:42.208
It's not like in your day.

50:42.333 --> 50:44.750
There are 300,000 teachers
waiting for jobs.

50:44.875 --> 50:45.708
So?

50:45.833 --> 50:48.583
You'll get a good score then
and beat them all.

50:48.708 --> 50:49.917
-Me?
-Yes, you.

50:50.420 --> 50:52.500
They'll watch you leave them behind.

51:10.875 --> 51:12.830
OK then.

51:12.625 --> 51:14.583
Leave it blank if you're unsure.

51:15.830 --> 51:16.958
Unless it's a choice of two.

51:17.830 --> 51:19.875
Otherwise, move on, don't guess.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.292
Why are you telling me this?

51:22.375 --> 51:24.583
Because it’s mathematically proven.

51:24.708 --> 51:26.375
-You got a cigarette?
-No.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.708
Any change? I'll go and get some.

51:33.250 --> 51:34.000
What?

51:34.958 --> 51:37.417
OK, we’ll go together
and you get them.

51:42.542 --> 51:43.792
OK then.

51:45.292 --> 51:48.875
By the way,
what's the pass score for teaching?

51:49.542 --> 51:51.875
You don't have to pretend
to be interested.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.208
I'm not pretending.

51:54.333 --> 51:56.830
What's up with you?

51:56.208 --> 51:57.792
Was there a pass score before?

51:57.958 --> 52:00.375
No. That's why I'm asking.

52:03.792 --> 52:05.958
Look! Necati has lit his grill.

52:06.830 --> 52:08.417
How about a meatball sandwich?

52:09.250 --> 52:11.458
Meatballs at this time of day?

52:12.208 --> 52:13.583
Didn’t you just have breakfast?

52:13.708 --> 52:16.500
No. Your mum was nagging me.

52:16.625 --> 52:18.708
I escaped right after you.

52:18.833 --> 52:20.958
Anyway, it's almost noon.

52:21.830 --> 52:23.458
You have a journey ahead.
Aren't you hungry?

52:23.583 --> 52:26.542
A journey?
It only takes 90 minutes.

52:26.917 --> 52:28.583
I suppose so.

52:28.708 --> 52:29.708
Right then.

52:30.292 --> 52:32.458
Then give me money for a sandwich.

52:32.583 --> 52:34.000
It smells so good.

52:34.125 --> 52:35.167
You never give up, do you!

52:36.250 --> 52:40.792
OK, never mind. Forget it.
You've got your exam. No worries.

52:40.917 --> 52:43.420
Good luck! Off you go.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.375
Look, the bus is about to leave.

52:47.500 --> 52:51.208
It's OK, forget it.
Find a seat.

52:51.333 --> 52:52.750
Go and sit down.

52:55.792 --> 52:58.542
OK, take this. Treat yourself.

52:58.667 --> 52:59.875
Fine, OK.

53:00.542 --> 53:01.250
OK.

53:01.333 --> 53:03.750
Take care.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.208
-Leave the ones you don't know.
-OK.

53:06.333 --> 53:07.375
Good luck!

53:07.500 --> 53:08.417
Thanks.

55:28.208 --> 55:29.708
Is the exam over, son?

55:30.208 --> 55:31.500
Is the exam over?

56:25.125 --> 56:26.917
How come you’re serving?
Where’s the apprentice?

56:27.420 --> 56:28.250
The apprentice?

56:28.375 --> 56:30.917
The fucker burned his balls.

56:31.333 --> 56:33.125
I left a bag here this morning.

56:33.250 --> 56:34.833
He'll be back.

56:35.830 --> 56:37.208
He finds serving tough, the fucker.

56:37.333 --> 56:38.958
No one from our gang here?

56:40.830 --> 56:42.000
They stopped coming.

56:42.125 --> 56:44.583
But you know, that kid?

56:44.708 --> 56:47.375
Seems he's now a cop.
He can stay away.

56:47.500 --> 56:50.125
-You don't like oops?
-I don't like him.

56:50.250 --> 56:53.208
Let him go to the east
and get a bomb up his ass.

56:53.708 --> 56:57.208
I'm home for just a while
and there's a new fucking generation!

57:01.167 --> 57:04.833
I sense a postmodern vibe
to your poverty, Nevzat.

57:05.208 --> 57:06.708
What are you thinking about?

57:07.420 --> 57:10.830
Well, 250 lira would solve my problems.

57:10.375 --> 57:11.375
What?

57:11.500 --> 57:12.500
What what?

57:12.625 --> 57:14.708
Those look like detailed calculations.

57:15.375 --> 57:18.375
First I need 140 lira
to reconnect the fucking electricity.

57:19.375 --> 57:22.667
I only owe 120
but there's a 20-Lira reconnection fee.

57:23.458 --> 57:26.292
Then when my son came home on leave,

57:26.417 --> 57:29.542
I got 8 lira's worth of bananas
from that hawker on the corner.

57:30.958 --> 57:35.167
Every day the guy glares at me
like I fucked his wife!

57:36.250 --> 57:38.542
If I pay him, we’ll both be spared.

57:39.458 --> 57:43.333
From Carrefour I need pasta, rice
and bulgur, 3 packets for 10 lira.

57:43.458 --> 57:45.125
The interior minister’s orders.

57:45.417 --> 57:48.420
Marmara Co-op has olives on offer.

57:48.250 --> 57:49.708
I'll get some.

57:50.333 --> 57:52.917
And there are shoe repairs
before winter arrives.

57:55.250 --> 57:56.875
But I'm hoping

57:57.750 --> 57:59.583
he won't charge me.

57:59.708 --> 58:01.875
Oh, and I need a basin screw.

58:02.542 --> 58:04.625
I'll send what's left to my son.

58:04.750 --> 58:06.792
He needs it in the army.

58:07.167 --> 58:08.833
-A basin screw?
-Yes.

58:08.958 --> 58:11.833
Why pay for it?
Nick it from another basin.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.500
I would, but none of them fucking fits!

58:18.830 --> 58:21.000
I hear some banks have this system...

58:21.125 --> 58:24.250
of not charging to wire money to the army.

58:24.417 --> 58:25.875
Have you heard of it?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.830
Hey, thanks for that.

58:33.958 --> 58:35.250
I'm talking to you!
-What?

58:35.375 --> 58:37.917
I said, some banks have this system

58:38.250 --> 58:41.958
where they don't take commission
to wire money to the army.

58:42.830 --> 58:44.750
Do you know about it?
-I'm not deaf!

58:44.875 --> 58:46.792
I was busy, that’s why I didn’t hear.

58:47.250 --> 58:48.625
No, I don't know about it.

59:01.708 --> 59:03.625
This isn't a manuscript.

59:03.750 --> 59:04.875
What?

59:05.000 --> 59:08.458
It's a printed edition
made to look like a manuscript.

59:08.750 --> 59:11.125
-How can you tell?
-From the tiny dots.

59:11.250 --> 59:12.420
Tiny dots?

59:12.167 --> 59:13.708
Take a look if you like.

59:18.417 --> 59:20.708
-So it's not worth anything?
-We
.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.420
It’s pretty old, you see.

59:24.167 --> 59:28.375
Old things aren't always valuable.

59:28.875 --> 59:30.583
Sure, but...

59:31.958 --> 59:33.667
So how much is it worth?

59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.000
Mr Suleyman?

01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:02.667
Hello.

01:00:03.625 --> 01:00:05.250
Do you remember me?

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:08.500
We met at the "Literature and rurality"
symposium.

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:10.333
Really?

01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:15.125
I was in the audience actually
but our eyes met once during the interval.

01:00:15.708 --> 01:00:17.708
I don't remember, but whatever.

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:20.875
Sorry, I'm surprised to see you here.

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:23.958
Do you have a moment?
I have a question.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:25.708
Sure. Go ahead.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.833
Let me sit down.
Do you mind?

01:00:30.792 --> 01:00:32.750
Sorry, if you don’t have time.

01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:35.420
No, I do. It’s OK.

01:00:35.167 --> 01:00:36.625
I'm Sinan by the way.

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:38.583
Yes, Sinan?

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:41.750
First, let me say
I've read nearly all your books.

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:43.208
-Really?
-Sure.

01:00:43.333 --> 01:00:45.375
It'd be unwise of a young aspiring writer

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.333
not to read the best-known local author.

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.708
Strategically at least.

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.458
When you say strategically?

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:59.000
It's not about
checking out the competition.

01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:04.125
But you want to know
how a different set of eyes

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:07.000
sees the same land,

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.667
the same views, the same people.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.125
So you want to be a writer?

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.875
Well, yes.
I'm writing now, for what it's worth.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.292
What genre?

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:22.750
I don’t know. Something like
musings on the local 'Life culture'.

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:26.625
Promotional things about the area?

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.750
-No, never. What gave you that idea?
-Why never?

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:33.375
"There are no facts,
only interpretations"

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.875
To quote the master.

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:38.792
I’m not someone to immerse myself
so deeply in the local.

01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:41.667
If my writing had to be categorized...

01:01:41.792 --> 01:01:45.292
some would say essays or short stories,

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:46.458
but it's not that either.

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:50.167
On their own, the pieces
might be perceived that way,

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:52.125
but taken as a whole,

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:57.458
I'd argue that they should be seen
as a quirky autofiction meta novel.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:01:59.420
A meta novel?

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:00.458
Yes.

01:02:01.292 --> 01:02:04.667
Hence my effort to pull it all together
into a single book.

01:02:04.792 --> 01:02:07.583
That's if I can find
a sponsor or publisher.

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:09.625
Which isn't exactly easy.

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.208
You'll manage.

01:02:11.667 --> 01:02:15.500
So what's it about,
this so-called quirky meta novel?

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:21.500
I guess it's one of those novels
you can't describe in a sentence or two.

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:24.750
Don't worry,
a word or two won't deflower it.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:27.830
Don't be so reticent.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:29.375
It's not that, but...

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:34.250
Simple minds like to reduce a work
to a rock-solid central idea.

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.583
I was referring to them.

01:02:36.708 --> 01:02:38.583
I don't include you in that mob

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:42.375
who deem a novel a failure

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.208
if they can't draw
a one-sentence moral from it.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:47.500
Trust me.

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:56.292
OK, fine.

01:02:57.542 --> 01:03:00.292
I know how first novels are.
You retreat from the world,

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:03.583
thinking everyone's waiting
for your book. But then...

01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:06.292
Don’t get me wrong.

01:03:06.417 --> 01:03:09.125
I'm not afraid
you'll steal my ideas.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.833
My goodness!

01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:13.000
Why would I think that?

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:15.420
It's totally ridiculous.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.625
I guess I said the wrong thing.
I’m sorry.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:20.250
That's OK,

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:23.420
but you said you had a question.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.375
I need to go soon.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.000
It doesn't matter.
I know the answer.

01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:28.292
Yes?

01:03:28.417 --> 01:03:30.125
There were other writers besides you

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:33.375
speaking at that symposium.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.417
The moderator read out
all their biographies.

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:37.625
Yes?

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.458
I was wondering if the writers

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.625
wrote those biographies themselves

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.333
or was it the organizing committee?

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:48.420
I expect everyone wrote their own.

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:49.250
Why?

01:03:49.417 --> 01:03:50.750
I thought so.

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:54.958
The choices people make
when they're describing themselves...

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:59.000
the things they consider important,
the words they use, they're all...

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:00.667
well, interesting.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:03.000
Meaning?

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:05.583
It's like a test of your self-image.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.167
Try as you may to hide it,

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:10.420
it reveals itself somehow.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:14.625
Then you can't help thinking
you don't need to read

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.667
an author advertising himself,

01:04:16.792 --> 01:04:18.750
like a slave waiting to be bought.

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:21.958
Well, think that if you want,

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.625
but you shouldn't look at it
like that.

01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:27.958
Don't judge a writer's work
by his personality.

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:29.292
They're two different things.

01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:31.625
How can you say that?

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:34.417
How can a writer be credible

01:04:34.542 --> 01:04:37.625
if he can't see his real self?

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:38.792
Listen, young man...

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.830
I'm surprised at you.

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:41.667
-What was your name?
-Sinan.

01:04:41.792 --> 01:04:46.208
Sinan, if you're here to provoke me,
there are many ways to do it.

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:48.375
No, of course not.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.458
-You misunderstand.
-You don’t stop.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:54.125
You aren’t talking
to an insentient being.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.250
-Why would I provoke you?
-No, OK.

01:04:57.375 --> 01:04:58.625
Far be it from me...

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:02.167
Look, I’ve seen a lot.
No matter, but...

01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:05.542
What I’m trying to say is this.

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:08.708
There were five of us writers there.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Did some of the bios bother you?

01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:15.333
No, not bother exactly,

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:19.420
embarrass might be more accurate,
Mr Suleyman.

01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:38.125
You're a student, right?

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:40.958
-I just graduated.
-Really?

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:42.250
In what?

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.667
Primary teacher.

01:05:43.792 --> 01:05:45.167
That's good.

01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:46.750
Not bad, I guess.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.708
So what now? The classroom?

01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:52.792
I need to wait for the results
of today's exam.

01:05:52.917 --> 01:05:54.167
The exam was today?
-Yes.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.583
How did it go?

01:05:56.708 --> 01:06:00.292
Not great. I may have to pick
another career.

01:06:00.417 --> 01:06:01.292
Such as?

01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:02.583
The police for instance.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:05.500
Like lots of teachers
who can't get a job.

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:08.375
I have a friend
who graduated in literature.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.000
He joined the riot police

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:13.292
when no job came up.
It pays well, too.

01:06:13.667 --> 01:06:15.958
In my case, I could write for a living.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:17.250
We'll see.

01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:20.208
-Writing isn't easy either.
-Sure isn't.

01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:22.375
But don't let me discourage you.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.420
No, I'm not afraid

01:06:25.167 --> 01:06:27.125
of facing the facts, that is.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.830
I struggled with a lot of issues
when writing the book,

01:06:30.208 --> 01:06:31.500
I can't deny it.

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:33.792
But the hardest thing of all

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:38.833
was to find my writing ordinary,

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:41.500
unlikely to interest anybody.

01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:44.708
You write kind of similar stuff.

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:47.333
How do you sustain
your self-belief to the end?

01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:52.458
It's not what you write,
but how you write it that matters.

01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:55.500
We're back to the famous cliché.

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:57.125
Yes, but clichés

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.667
sometimes contain
fundamental truths.

01:06:59.792 --> 01:07:05.830
When I write, I enrich life,
banality, with what I bring.

01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:07.000
The point being

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:09.000
nothing is as ordinary as it seems.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:11.625
I knead the dough, let it rise

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:13.417
and bake it.

01:07:13.958 --> 01:07:15.250
Then we eat it.

01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:17.125
Well.

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:19.625
-You see my point?
-Sure.

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:21.458
There's subject matter everywhere,

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.458
but only if you can see it.

01:07:23.583 --> 01:07:25.875
What if you can see it
but not articulate it?

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:29.250
You need to work.
But talent is the main thing.

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:32.667
So should people like us
give up writing?

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:35.167
When you say "us"?

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:38.000
People not born with that magical power.

01:07:38.833 --> 01:07:41.375
Frankly, I think I'm lucky there.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.917
Don't be so quick to judge yourself.

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.667
You're on your first book.

01:07:45.792 --> 01:07:47.708
And it hasn't even been published yet.

01:07:47.792 --> 01:07:49.708
You must soldier on.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:51.958
Or knuckle down to teach in the east.

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:53.417
Do that anyway.

01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:55.583
And remember teaching

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:58.833
is one job
that leaves time for writing.

01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:02.375
Maybe that's why there are
so many writer-teachers around.

01:08:02.542 --> 01:08:04.708
Anyway.

01:08:05.125 --> 01:08:08.250
When it comes to writing,
I don't believe in excuses.

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:12.167
A good writer doesn't whine.
He sits down and writes.

01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:13.958
Whatever the circumstances.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.375
At the cost of neglecting
family and friends

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.125
or using them if need be?

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:24.250
Why not?

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.792
Anything goes
if your conscience can handle it.

01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:29.250
You already know that.

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:33.000
-What if it can't?
-Then you'll suffer for it.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:36.500
Writers must be able
to take risks.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.417
Iron doesn’t become steel
without time in the furnace.

01:08:42.332 --> 01:08:45.667
Say there's an object
you’re prepared to discard.

01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:50.542
Most people see it as sacred,
but ultimately it’s an object.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:54.832
Now, this object
can help someone so much

01:08:54.957 --> 01:08:58.830
that it may even contribute minutely
to the advancement of humanity.

01:08:58.457 --> 01:08:59.332
Yes?

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:01.420
In your opinion,

01:09:01.167 --> 01:09:04.582
would it be out-of-line
to grab the object for yourself

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.917
behind the owner’s back?

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.250
Maybe not, but...

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:14.750
if the owner then bashes
the 'grabber' on the head

01:09:14.875 --> 01:09:16.375
and breaks his skull,

01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:19.125
that wouldn't be
out-of-line either.

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.667
Anyway, I have to go.

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:30.582
Anyone would think
you're running away.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.417
I've already stayed too long.

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.875
I still have one last question.

01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:39.957
For how many points?

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.292
Lots.

01:09:42.375 --> 01:09:44.625
In that case, go ahead.

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.832
Most of the rural writers
at the symposium

01:09:47.957 --> 01:09:50.830
agreed that literature

01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:53.792
has no centre
other than the language,

01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:56.333
where pen meets paper.

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:57.375
I'm off now!

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.958
Goodbye, Mr Suleyman!

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.250
Do you really believe that?

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:07.125
It's a bit too vast a subject.

01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:10.125
-Don’t you believe it?
-I don't know.

01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:13.833
They read a letter from a writer
who refused to come.

01:10:13.958 --> 01:10:15.708
-You remember?
-Yes.

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:19.420
I'd love to know
what you thought of it.

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:22.830
The writer called himself
an undiluted rural man.

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:25.708
I don't remember
exactly what was in the letter.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:30.250
The gist was
to subtly condemn or show his contempt

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:35.000
for those taking part
in these kinds of events.

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:36.583
That's why I'm asking.

01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:39.000
If I'd been a speaker there like you,

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:43.125
it would've made me uncomfortable.

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:44.458
Why?

01:10:44.625 --> 01:10:47.458
I don't know.
But given the letter,

01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:50.958
the speakers suddenly looked like

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.792
cultural missionaries

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:57.792
who came there to say
they'd die if they couldn't write.

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:02.750
You know what?

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:06.833
You're like Semir in Survivor.
Why are you so contrarian?

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:09.375
So you watch Survivor!

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.875
But I thought artists

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:13.000
were supposed to oppose everything?

01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:15.958
No. You have the wrong idea.

01:11:16.667 --> 01:11:20.958
If I'd been in charge,
I wouldn't have read out the letter.

01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:25.420
I wouldn't want to be part
of a cheap stunt.

01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:28.500
What is this remote-controlled manifesto?

01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:30.333
The letter annoyed you?

01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:32.583
No, I don't give a damn.

01:11:32.708 --> 01:11:34.542
The dogs bark,
the caravan moves on.

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:37.125
There are many ways to be valued.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.708
I'm not stupid.

01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:41.667
I see how they try to grab the limelight.

01:11:41.792 --> 01:11:43.417
He said that, from the start,

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.542
he swore never to go to these events.

01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:47.708
For one thing,

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:51.708
you don’t start writing
like you start a regular job.

01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:53.000
That’s just a cheap game.

01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:56.292
But in this world
where nothing is sacred,

01:11:56.417 --> 01:12:01.208
someone isolating himself
for the sake of art

01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:03.958
doesn't give you hope?

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:08.000
He refuses teamwork, collaborations

01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:10.625
and artistic alliances.

01:12:10.833 --> 01:12:11.917
On the contrary,

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:15.375
that letter struck me
as the dithering of a naive youth

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.167
too mortified to speak

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.542
in front of a crowd he overrates,

01:12:19.667 --> 01:12:23.708
but desperate to conceal this failing
from himself and the world

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:26.792
under the veil of philosophy.

01:12:27.167 --> 01:12:28.792
But you won't understand this yet.

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:30.667
Why not?

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.750
You're too young.

01:12:36.208 --> 01:12:39.375
As you get older
you will begin to see

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:44.125
romantic ventures like that letter

01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:48.167
as the callow excesses
of a young heart.

01:12:48.292 --> 01:12:49.000
Callow excesses?

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:51.500
The letter's not bad.

01:12:51.625 --> 01:12:54.420
I see it as an impassioned cry

01:12:54.167 --> 01:12:56.458
from the depths of the countryside.

01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:57.625
Nonetheless...

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.000
I'm sorry to say
find it sugary

01:13:01.125 --> 01:13:03.583
and nauseatingly sentimental.

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:07.917
Don't think I didn't realize
soon after meeting you,

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.833
that you're an incurably
obsessed romantic.

01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.500
I'm not obsessed...

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:14.167
But despite everything,

01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:17.208
as you saw, I didn't walk away.

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:18.875
I didn't send you packing.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.830
I let you get it all out.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:24.542
I was patient and polite
despite your sarcasm and insinuations.

01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:27.375
-But it’s time you let me go home!
-No, no! There was no sarcasm.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.375
OK? Let me go home

01:13:29.458 --> 01:13:32.500
and soak my feet in salt water!

01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:34.958
-You know why?
-You misunderstand.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:39.792
Because there’s just one reality
I’ve been aware of the last half-hour.

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:43.830
The searing pain in my legs

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:45.250
and sneaky pain in my neck

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:48.167
just waiting

01:13:48.292 --> 01:13:51.167
to become a killer migraine.

01:13:51.292 --> 01:13:53.583
You know what that means, young friend?

01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:57.958
I don't fucking care
about the centre of literature

01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:59.458
being language or any other shit!

01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:02.542
That’s what naive brains like yours
fail to grasp!

01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:04.750
There isn't only one reality!

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:05.875
That’s going a bit far.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.917
Literature, success... You can keep them!

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:11.333
-A
-People are staring.

01:14:11.458 --> 01:14:13.667
I'd turn down a Nobel Prize right now!

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.417
Can I be any clearer?

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:19.667
So excuse me, young friend.
I'm going!

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:40.917
Fuck you if you'd turn down a Nobel!

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:51.750
Mr Suleyman!

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.167
Could you possibly read my first draft?

01:14:58.125 --> 01:15:00.500
It would be great to get your feedback,

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:03.420
especially after that last tirade.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.708
Sorry, I can't do that.

01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:07.667
Really. Why?

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:12.833
If I tried to read every book
I was asked to,

01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:14.500
how would I ever write my own?

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:17.292
Don’t then. That wouldn't be a great loss.

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.833
OK, OK. That was a joke.

01:15:20.792 --> 01:15:23.333
Anyway, thanks all the same.

01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:12.958
Hey, wake up.

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:14.833
We've arrived.

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:54.208
Go to the betting shop!

01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:56.292
So he's ashamed to see you.

01:18:57.292 --> 01:18:59.420
What's this about, Muharrem?

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:02.420
Teachers should set an example.

01:19:02.167 --> 01:19:03.542
What kind of example is he?

01:19:03.667 --> 01:19:05.625
Go and he might be ashamed!

01:19:09.167 --> 01:19:10.750
Are you an example?

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:12.250
Look at you!

01:19:13.292 --> 01:19:14.417
Baldy!

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.000
Hey! Welcome.

01:19:38.417 --> 01:19:40.420
What's that? Fish?

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:43.875
You're something else.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.125
What's up?

01:19:45.583 --> 01:19:48.420
You don't go to the Teachers' Club,

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:50.583
you sit here with these idiots.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.500
What idiots?

01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:02.000
When did you get back?

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:06.500
Go hang out at the Club.

01:20:06.625 --> 01:20:08.250
What you doing in this dive?

01:20:08.375 --> 01:20:11.792
Reading the paper.
I'll go there later.

01:20:13.792 --> 01:20:16.333
Every time,
somebody you owe ambushes me.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:18.208
I'm fed up!

01:20:18.458 --> 01:20:20.708
You're dragging us into your swamp.

01:20:20.833 --> 01:20:22.958
Who ambushed you? How dare they?

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:24.500
What a nerve!

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:27.792
What a nerve indeed.

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:30.125
How can you be so relaxed?

01:20:31.583 --> 01:20:34.542
while we bear the brunt?

01:20:34.792 --> 01:20:36.708
Seriously, what's the secret?

01:20:36.792 --> 01:20:41.167
What are you saying?
Because I'm reading the paper?

01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:43.875
You still think
it’s about reading the paper!

01:20:44.417 --> 01:20:46.500
Didn’t you promise not come back here?

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:48.792
I'm not gambling.
I'm reading my paper.

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:52.250
Reading because you have to.
Because you don’t have...

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:54.250
the money to gamble!

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:55.542
Here we go again.

01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:56.958
Here you go again.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.875
I don’t know
what to say to you anymore.

01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:08.420
How was the exam?

01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:14.917
Bad.

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.708
What do you expect?
I didn't study.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.667
Why not?

01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:23.667
I just didn't.

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.830
Never mind.
At least college is over.

01:21:27.208 --> 01:21:29.667
Study and retake it next year.

01:21:29.958 --> 01:21:31.625
What are you looking for?

01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:33.792
An old notebook.

01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:35.750
It seems to be missing.

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:37.500
Has anyone been rummaging in there?

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:39.417
No. Who would do that?

01:21:42.792 --> 01:21:45.292
Pass me that green album, will you?

01:22:04.667 --> 01:22:05.875
Look at that.

01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:10.292
When I see the bigwigs
he used to hang around with,

01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:13.875
it's hard to believe now.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.420
Who were these bigwigs?

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.375
I don't know. Head teachers,

01:22:20.917 --> 01:22:24.830
people from the education board,
that kind.

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:27.917
Is that what you call bigwigs?

01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:32.333
Yes. Decent, honest people.

01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:36.333
Not like that Ekrem
he hangs out with now.

01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:38.375
Look how low he's sunk.

01:22:39.667 --> 01:22:40.875
Which Ekrem?

01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:44.500
Remember your pal
from the industrial park?

01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:46.500
Ekrem with the big head?

01:22:48.167 --> 01:22:50.833
Stop doing people down.
Shame on you!

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.417
What a jerk!

01:22:52.542 --> 01:22:55.417
Friends with a guy his dad's age?

01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:57.958
Unbelievable.

01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:00.542
Nobody asks after us now.

01:23:00.667 --> 01:23:02.208
He's ruined his reputation.

01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:05.667
And with gambling for years,

01:23:05.792 --> 01:23:10.292
he could at least surprise us
by winning once.

01:23:10.708 --> 01:23:13.833
He'd only gamble it away again.

01:23:15.292 --> 01:23:17.500
How do you know he's never won?

01:23:18.792 --> 01:23:21.667
You share the winnings, don't you?

01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:25.458
If only...

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:27.958
He even got a merit award.

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:29.542
Sure.

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:32.417
He wasn't like this before.
He was ambitious.

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:34.420
He worked like crazy.

01:23:34.167 --> 01:23:37.830
Hard to imagine that now.

01:23:38.542 --> 01:23:40.333
Time is strange.

01:23:40.458 --> 01:23:42.000
It slips by without you noticing.

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:45.917
What else would it do?
Wait for you to do something?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:46.958
What?

01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:49.420
Wait for who to do what?

01:23:49.167 --> 01:23:52.208
Nothing.
I'm just saying time marches on.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.917
Someone once called time a silent saw.

01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:58.625
You never know what it'll do to us.

01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:03.250
Look what he wrote
on this photo.

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:05.917
"I’m walking along a road,

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.625
not knowing where it leads."

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:12.250
Look at the words he uses.

01:24:12.375 --> 01:24:13.875
Thinks he's Tolstoy!

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.625
Like he has the guts
to walk away!

01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:19.208
Don't say that.
He did run off once.

01:24:19.333 --> 01:24:20.625
And what happened?

01:24:20.958 --> 01:24:23.375
Scuttled back two days later.

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.208
I understand what you just said.

01:24:51.125 --> 01:24:52.583
Which bit?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.375
About time not waiting

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.500
for us to do something.

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:58.708
Well?

01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:02.125
Have we done nothing for you?

01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:05.420
Did I say that?

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:07.208
No matter what, he’s your father.

01:25:07.375 --> 01:25:10.167
Without him
you'd never have gone to college.

01:25:10.292 --> 01:25:12.167
He worked hard for you.

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.792
What good did it do?

01:25:13.917 --> 01:25:17.875
-You got everything you wanted.
-He put me in a faith dorm to avoid paying.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.420
All the kids envied your toys.

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:21.917
Thank God I've escaped that crap.

01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:23.375
You had it easy.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.750
Did I deny it?

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.750
Think how hard it was for them.

01:25:26.833 --> 01:25:29.417
If he's so great, keep him.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:33.830
At 40 you have to start babysitting

01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:35.420
and still you’re defending him!

01:25:35.167 --> 01:25:38.458
That's different.
Just look around you.

01:25:38.792 --> 01:25:42.458
Other fathers are violent, they drink.

01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:46.333
Your dad never hit you once, did he?

01:25:46.458 --> 01:25:49.625
It would've been better
than making all those promises

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:54.875
and still going to the betting shop.

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:02.583
I wasn't going to tell you.

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:04.542
But you pushed me.

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:10.833
Though if I hadn't told you,
would it change the truth anyway?

01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:30.420
I didn't raise you to do evil.

01:26:30.167 --> 01:26:31.875
Enough!

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.542
My back can't take it!

01:26:33.667 --> 01:26:34.625
Sinan?

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.750
Give them a hand with that sofa.

01:26:37.875 --> 01:26:40.420
I can't. My back is a mess.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.875
I’m your mother!
Isn't it my right to see you happy?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.833
Must I always live with the thought
that you'll be hated?

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:54.667
But, mother! Dearest mother!

01:26:54.833 --> 01:26:56.542
I want to live, not die!

01:26:57.125 --> 01:27:00.833
Don’t you remember our childhood?

01:27:00.917 --> 01:27:04.333
Growing up in rags, no father.
All that suffering

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:07.458
Got any rope?

01:27:07.583 --> 01:27:09.667
The caretaker's yelling at us.

01:27:09.792 --> 01:27:12.000
Do we have any rope in the house?

01:27:16.917 --> 01:27:19.625
Have you got any thick rope?

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:22.583
We can't move that couch without it.

01:27:22.708 --> 01:27:24.833
-Our rope broke.
-I'll have a look.

01:27:25.167 --> 01:27:28.333
We don't want to mark
those newly painted walls.

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.833
Our father died in poverty

01:27:34.167 --> 01:27:36.958
While we studied under street lamps.

01:27:37.125 --> 01:27:41.500
to avoid being a slave.

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:45.830
And What did if change? Who loves you?

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:46.542
Everyone’s afraid of you.

01:27:46.667 --> 01:27:48.292
Everyone hates you.

01:27:48.417 --> 01:27:50.292
Even your friends.

01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:51.333
Even me!

01:27:51.458 --> 01:27:53.292
How's this?

01:27:53.417 --> 01:27:55.830
Got anything thicker?

01:27:56.417 --> 01:27:58.292
No. Won't this do?

01:27:58.875 --> 01:28:00.417
We can try it.

01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:04.250
That staircase is too steep and narrow
to do it without rope.

01:28:04.375 --> 01:28:05.667
Thanks.

01:28:05.792 --> 01:28:08.000
Enough! Enough!

01:28:08.125 --> 01:28:11.208
I won’t let a stranger kill you.
I'll kill you myself.

01:28:11.333 --> 01:28:14.875
I’m the one Who’s going to kill you!
Me! Me!

01:29:01.583 --> 01:29:04.875
I rely on my gun.
My life is threatened

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.208
They want me dead in Istanbul.

01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:09.375
There’s a bounty on my head.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.830
Not if you walk away from it, Far.

01:29:12.375 --> 01:29:13.708
If only you'd understand

01:29:14.208 --> 01:29:15.583
If only you could

01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:17.208
C'mon

01:29:17.333 --> 01:29:19.792
you, me and my gun.

01:29:19.958 --> 01:29:22.667
- You, me and my gun. Can’t we do that?
-No

01:29:22.792 --> 01:29:24.333
-Say yes!
-No

01:29:24.458 --> 01:29:25.250
Say yes!

01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:26.542
No!

01:29:54.833 --> 01:29:56.917
Did anyone take money from my pocket?

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.542
What?

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:01.292
Money.

01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:03.583
Did anyone take my money?

01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:05.125
There's 300 missing.

01:30:07.875 --> 01:30:09.917
What? What money?

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:14.208
I had 700 lira, I'm missing 300.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.875
If it was a joke, it's not funny.

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:20.208
C'mon, who'd do that?
Where was the money?

01:30:20.333 --> 01:30:21.917
In my top pocket.

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.125
What could've happened to it?

01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:26.208
Did you have a good look?

01:30:26.333 --> 01:30:28.875
Could it be in your trousers?

01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:33.750
Whoever took it, give it back!

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.375
Who's "whoever"?

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.417
Who would take your money here?

01:30:38.542 --> 01:30:39.833
Why all the drama?

01:30:39.958 --> 01:30:42.458
Calm down! Let's just think.

01:30:43.125 --> 01:30:44.208
Are you yelling at me?

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:46.292
Hey! What’s the yelling about?

01:30:46.417 --> 01:30:48.750
He lost his money and is accusing us.

01:30:48.875 --> 01:30:49.583
What money?

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:53.000
Lost it in the house?
When did you last see it?

01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:57.000
If it’s lost,
you look for it and find it.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.333
Hang on.

01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:07.250
You don't think it was the workers?

01:31:07.875 --> 01:31:09.420
The door was open.

01:31:09.167 --> 01:31:12.250
Maybe when you went to help, someone...

01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:15.583
But no, no. That can’t be it.

01:31:15.708 --> 01:31:17.958
It's not fair to accuse them.

01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:19.958
Were they inside alone?

01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:23.792
The guy was at the door
when I went to get the rope.

01:31:23.917 --> 01:31:26.250
But not for long.

01:31:28.958 --> 01:31:29.917
The rope's there.

01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:32.333
What workers, for God's sake!

01:31:33.333 --> 01:31:35.833
How come you had 700 lira anyway?

01:31:35.917 --> 01:31:39.125
"How come you had 700 lira anyway?"

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.292
It was my book money!

01:31:41.417 --> 01:31:43.667
But you're done with college.

01:31:43.792 --> 01:31:45.750
Are you guys taking the piss?

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:48.830
I saved it to publish my book!

01:31:48.208 --> 01:31:50.417
The book I wrote, not textbooks.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.917
-What book? What kind of book?
-A good book!

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.417
You wrote it?

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:56.208
No, Grandad did!

01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:00.875
OK, something urgent came up,
someone needed it. That can happen.

01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:02.625
But whoever took it, give it back.

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:05.292
And he's still saying that!

01:32:05.417 --> 01:32:06.750
We took your money, did we?

01:32:06.875 --> 01:32:08.667
"We took your money, did we?"

01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:10.000
Listen to him!

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:12.875
Mum, say something!

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.500
Calm down! The neighbours will hear!

01:32:15.625 --> 01:32:17.875
What are you doing?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.333
Stop!

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:23.542
-He's accusing us of stealing!
-Quiet, Yasemin! Get in there.

01:32:23.667 --> 01:32:26.375
Very funny, Dad! Very funny.

01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:29.458
Show some respect.

01:32:29.583 --> 01:32:32.375
An angry man is his own worst enemy.

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.830
Is it worth breaking hearts over money?

01:32:36.292 --> 01:32:38.875
-I said "whoever"!
-C'mon, you're a graduate.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.333
How about looking after your money!

01:32:41.292 --> 01:32:43.375
That's enough!

01:32:43.583 --> 01:32:45.830
Let's sit down

01:32:45.208 --> 01:32:47.333
and think calmly,
for goodness sake!

01:33:28.417 --> 01:33:31.250
I can leave you the file
if you like.

01:33:31.375 --> 01:33:33.750
It might take a while
to read the whole thing.

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:36.420
No need. Nice job.

01:33:36.458 --> 01:33:38.958
I don't know.
Maybe it makes no sense.

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:41.792
No, it's a great book.

01:33:41.917 --> 01:33:43.917
Seriously.

01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:46.830
I like things like this.

01:33:46.208 --> 01:33:47.792
Seriously, bravo!

01:33:47.917 --> 01:33:49.420
Thanks.

01:33:49.167 --> 01:33:52.917
The mayor said you're a big reader.

01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:54.833
That's right, I am.

01:33:54.917 --> 01:33:57.917
I haven't read a lot lately, though.

01:33:58.420 --> 01:33:59.667
But I used to, yes.

01:34:03.458 --> 01:34:05.625
I’m just back from Bursa actually.

01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:08.750
-My mother needed surgery.
-Really?

01:34:08.875 --> 01:34:10.375
Apart from the stress,

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:11.542
it cost a lot.

01:34:11.667 --> 01:34:13.375
Sorry to hear it.

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:16.000
I also want to revamp this place.

01:34:16.125 --> 01:34:20.420
I want to extend the front
to give it a more corporate look.

01:34:20.167 --> 01:34:22.542
Good idea.
But this also works.

01:34:22.667 --> 01:34:23.875
When it's done,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.500
I want to photograph it.

01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:28.833
Do you have a camera?

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:30.583
No.

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:32.625
But I could get one.

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:35.750
I have an old one at home actually.

01:34:35.875 --> 01:34:38.420
I don't know if it would do.
It's small.

01:34:40.958 --> 01:34:42.333
Yes, Sinan?

01:34:42.792 --> 01:34:43.917
Well...

01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:47.333
It’s all about life, people,
the 'Life culture' here.

01:34:47.458 --> 01:34:49.250
Nice, bravo.

01:34:49.375 --> 01:34:52.583
-Congratulations. Really.
-Thanks.

01:34:52.917 --> 01:34:55.830
-I like hard workers.
-Thanks.

01:34:55.208 --> 01:34:57.830
How long did it take you to write this?

01:34:57.208 --> 01:35:01.458
Well it's not like counting
truckloads of sand...

01:35:01.583 --> 01:35:04.833
But all the same,
you're producing something, so am
.

01:35:04.958 --> 01:35:07.458
OK, different things, but same idea.

01:35:07.583 --> 01:35:08.875
I agree.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.708
Because if I don't do my calculations...

01:35:11.833 --> 01:35:14.750
Say the sand is on its way...

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:19.375
I can't wait for inspiration
before I transport it!

01:35:19.958 --> 01:35:22.750
True. You're absolutely right.

01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:24.830
So there we are.

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:25.417
In fact.

01:35:26.542 --> 01:35:27.500
we'll see.

01:35:27.625 --> 01:35:31.292
I wrote it, but publishing
is a whole new business.

01:35:31.417 --> 01:35:32.500
You'll manage.

01:35:32.625 --> 01:35:34.875
But bring me a copy when it's out.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.583
I'm curious about this
life culture thing.

01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:39.875
Qanakkale is in there, too.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
You mean across the water?

01:35:42.125 --> 01:35:44.208
No, not the War Cemetery.

01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:46.417
To be honest,
I don't think it's right

01:35:46.542 --> 01:35:50.333
to immediately associate Qanakkale
with Troy or the War Cemetery.

01:35:50.458 --> 01:35:51.375
Why not?

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.208
This place has its own life culture.

01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:56.333
But that's totally eclipsed
by the cemetery and all that.

01:35:56.458 --> 01:35:59.583
But we're world famous for that.

01:35:59.708 --> 01:36:00.417
True.

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.875
It's the world's
best-preserved battlefield.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.125
If the world values us for that,

01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:09.583
there must be a reason for it.

01:36:09.708 --> 01:36:11.917
True, but I see other things.

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.375
There's an old man in a fedora,

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:18.542
who sells fruit, sings, drinks wine.

01:36:18.958 --> 01:36:22.250
That's the kind of thing
I write about.

01:36:22.333 --> 01:36:25.208
Tourists take photos of him, too.

01:36:25.333 --> 01:36:26.625
Hold on!

01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:30.625
Are you comparing
Wino Riza with our war martyrs?

01:36:30.708 --> 01:36:32.542
No, of course not.

01:36:32.667 --> 01:36:33.833
Hold on a second!

01:36:34.125 --> 01:36:35.542
I don't understand.

01:36:35.667 --> 01:36:36.792
I didn't say that. I just...

01:36:36.917 --> 01:36:39.958
Your "life culture" thing is everywhere.

01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:43.458
But is there a battlefield
as well preserved anywhere?

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.208
That's different. I'm not saying...

01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:48.417
Why trust tourists?

01:36:48.583 --> 01:36:51.875
They snap away
at everything they see.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
If they take photos of the old man,

01:36:54.125 --> 01:36:55.375
it's for a laugh.

01:36:55.708 --> 01:36:58.292
To be frank
we're not on the same page here.

01:36:58.542 --> 01:36:59.708
If youngsters like you

01:36:59.833 --> 01:37:03.333
don't defend
our martyrs and moral values,

01:37:03.458 --> 01:37:04.542
who will?

01:37:04.667 --> 01:37:06.333
How did we even get on to this?

01:37:06.417 --> 01:37:10.125
You led us here, that's how.

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:12.917
Institutions and NGOs are all competing
to support the War Cemetery.

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.830
Sure they are. It's their job.

01:37:15.208 --> 01:37:19.917
They’re all using it to get work,
an identity, even almost an existence.

01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:21.542
Don't you see that?

01:37:21.792 --> 01:37:25.667
Who’ll look after the old man
who still has to work at 80?

01:37:25.792 --> 01:37:29.000
-Isn't that more important?
-As if he has nobody!

01:37:29.125 --> 01:37:32.167
Anyway, he isn't in the book
because I felt sorry for him.

01:37:32.292 --> 01:37:34.875
I'm just searching for life's secrets.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.500
Here is an uncomplaining old man

01:37:37.625 --> 01:37:40.250
who seems to know the secret to happiness.

01:37:40.375 --> 01:37:44.167
His world might contain
a secret that could help us all.

01:37:44.292 --> 01:37:48.208
There's a ton of identical books on Troy
and the Memorial already.

01:37:48.333 --> 01:37:51.750
If you're that interested,
get one and read it.

01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:58.792
Kadriye, what happened
with those vehicle contracts?

01:38:00.542 --> 01:38:01.833
Send them to me.

01:38:01.958 --> 01:38:05.830
They haven't come through?
OK, remind them.

01:38:05.208 --> 01:38:06.792
We need them.

01:38:17.875 --> 01:38:20.250
The less you have to lose,

01:38:20.375 --> 01:38:22.417
the less responsibility you have.

01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:24.708
the happier you'll be.

01:38:25.125 --> 01:38:28.625
I don't see any big secret in that.

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:31.333
That's just the way you see it.

01:38:31.625 --> 01:38:33.417
Look, young man.

01:38:33.708 --> 01:38:35.167
I'm not educated.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.420
I'm a high-school dropout.

01:38:37.167 --> 01:38:39.833
But I've never regretted it.

01:38:39.958 --> 01:38:40.875
You know why?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Because I trust my feelings.

01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:45.917
Feelings and instinct
have been my guide in life.

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.958
I don't remember ever being mistaken.

01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:51.000
Good for you.

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:52.292
But...

01:38:52.375 --> 01:38:55.917
look at my friends
who went to university.

01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:58.208
They're all in deep shit today.

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:02.375
Some work for me,
some work for peanuts elsewhere.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.708
Some got divorced.

01:39:04.833 --> 01:39:07.000
One even committed suicide.

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:11.420
Sure, education is great,
but this is Turkey.

01:39:11.208 --> 01:39:13.625
If you want to survive in this country,

01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:15.875
you need to adapt.

01:39:16.292 --> 01:39:17.833
OK, you learn stuff at school,

01:39:17.958 --> 01:39:20.208
but the street is different.

01:39:20.333 --> 01:39:21.625
It's always moving forward.

01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:24.458
What you learn today
will be useless by tomorrow.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:28.708
That's why
the reality punches them in the face.

01:39:28.833 --> 01:39:29.958
They can't adjust.

01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:33.583
They’re standoffish with normal people.
They look down on them.

01:39:33.792 --> 01:39:35.750
The market is ruthless.

01:39:35.875 --> 01:39:37.667
It takes pity on no one.

01:39:38.542 --> 01:39:40.458
So where are they now?

01:39:40.583 --> 01:39:42.750
Disappeared, gone forever.

01:39:42.875 --> 01:39:45.375
But I'm still here!

01:39:46.417 --> 01:39:48.292
Nothing has come to me ready-made.

01:39:48.417 --> 01:39:50.625
Everything I got,

01:39:50.708 --> 01:39:53.167
I got with my own blood, sweat and tears.

01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:02.625
So I should work, save
and publish the book myself?

01:40:03.208 --> 01:40:06.167
Of course I'm not saying that.

01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:10.292
But now I think about it,
that's not a bad idea actually.

01:40:10.458 --> 01:40:14.167
If I’m here, it’s because I heard
you support projects like this.

01:40:14.292 --> 01:40:17.375
I didn't just turn up on a whim.

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.833
Then why did you support them?

01:40:21.292 --> 01:40:22.375
When you say them?

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.417
All these projects.

01:40:24.542 --> 01:40:26.625
Your logo is on a ton of posters.

01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:30.830
The council used to buy a lot of sand.
That's why I was generous.

01:40:30.208 --> 01:40:31.417
We had an agreement.

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.000
A vested interest then.

01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:34.625
What are you talking about?

01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:38.375
You have to do these things.
We're in the sand business.

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:40.420
We do what we have to do.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:43.833
You’re good to good customers.
What’s not to get about that?

01:40:56.958 --> 01:40:58.500
So, Ekrem,

01:40:58.625 --> 01:41:00.250
you started betting too?

01:41:00.375 --> 01:41:02.125
No, I'm just looking.

01:41:02.417 --> 01:41:05.708
I don't have the fucking money anyway.

01:41:05.833 --> 01:41:06.833
Right.

01:41:06.958 --> 01:41:09.830
-Kami! Two teas!
-Coming up!

01:41:09.208 --> 01:41:09.917
So?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.333
So, how's it going?

01:41:11.458 --> 01:41:12.917
Not bad. You?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.750
Same as always.

01:41:14.875 --> 01:41:16.625
I hear you hang out with my dad?

01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:18.500
I run into him sometimes.

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:21.000
Where do you guys go?

01:41:21.125 --> 01:41:22.583
Where can you go here?

01:41:22.708 --> 01:41:25.667
To one fucking teahouse or another.

01:41:26.542 --> 01:41:28.167
What the fuck is this?

01:41:29.417 --> 01:41:31.420
Hang out with guys your own age.

01:41:31.167 --> 01:41:32.625
What's your problem?

01:41:34.125 --> 01:41:35.458
What did you say?

01:41:35.583 --> 01:41:37.750
You’re like two tribes
against one fucking elephant.

01:41:37.875 --> 01:41:39.625
Can't you find anyone else?

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:42.250
Don't give me this shit!

01:41:42.375 --> 01:41:46.333
We've been busting our asses for years
to get the man to quit.

01:41:47.458 --> 01:41:49.250
Stick to your own age group!

01:41:49.375 --> 01:41:51.125
Go fuck yourself!

01:41:51.833 --> 01:41:53.875
What’s wrong if I ran into him twice?

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.208
Fuck off and talk to your dad
if you have a problem.

01:42:12.583 --> 01:42:17.958
Half of the Newly qualiﬁed teachers
have been posted to the East...

01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:20.542
I’d been waiting for two years.

01:42:20.667 --> 01:42:23.292
I'm so happy to go anywhere
in my country.

01:42:23.417 --> 01:42:26.250
I’m crying for Joy,
not because of the East.

01:43:38.792 --> 01:43:40.875
Ah! When did you get here?

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.420
An hour ago.

01:43:42.167 --> 01:43:45.167
I got a ride with the barber
since you took the car.

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.000
-Are they home?
-Yes.

01:43:48.958 --> 01:43:50.833
The door here was off its hinges,

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:52.750
so I thought I'd fix it.

01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:54.167
OK.

01:43:54.292 --> 01:43:55.417
Sinan!

01:43:56.708 --> 01:44:00.420
Hold this and let's put it back.

01:44:10.458 --> 01:44:11.458
Just a second.

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:13.625
Easy there.

01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:16.333
Do the top first.

01:44:17.917 --> 01:44:18.875
There we go.

01:44:25.333 --> 01:44:27.667
Let's go up there sometime.

01:44:27.917 --> 01:44:29.500
I found another boulder.

01:44:29.625 --> 01:44:30.917
I've dug around it.

01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:33.875
It'll take an hour at most.
It's not a big job.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.542
What boulder?

01:44:36.667 --> 01:44:38.750
Did I come back for that?

01:44:38.875 --> 01:44:40.625
No need to yell.

01:44:41.833 --> 01:44:43.208
Are you in a hurry?

01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:45.000
You never stop.

01:44:45.833 --> 01:44:49.830
I’m not about to be part of your show
to win favour here.

01:44:51.917 --> 01:44:53.792
I don't follow. What show?

01:44:53.917 --> 01:44:55.875
Whose favour do I want?

01:44:56.833 --> 01:44:59.333
Why ask when you know the answer?

01:45:00.833 --> 01:45:04.667
Is fixing a door going to win back
the respect you’ve lost?

01:45:05.208 --> 01:45:08.292
It's not the door that needs fixing.

01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:10.542
So what is it?

01:45:11.375 --> 01:45:12.542
I don't know.

01:45:14.667 --> 01:45:16.708
Whatever you lack.

01:45:17.583 --> 01:45:19.667
What does that mean?

01:45:21.292 --> 01:45:24.420
Can’t this kind of thing be done
just as a favour?

01:45:24.542 --> 01:45:26.542
Someone has to fix the door.

01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:30.125
So can't it be fixed purely as a favour?

01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:33.420
If you and I don't do it,
who will?

01:45:33.167 --> 01:45:34.833
You're doing it purely as a favour?

01:45:34.958 --> 01:45:35.708
Yes.

01:45:35.833 --> 01:45:38.250
You don't think I can?

01:45:38.375 --> 01:45:39.917
What's your idea of a favour?

01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:41.167
Tell me.

01:45:41.833 --> 01:45:43.458
C'mon, let's talk about that.

01:45:46.417 --> 01:45:47.417
Sit still!

01:45:47.542 --> 01:45:49.958
Why did you agree?

01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:51.958
Has your brain stopped?

01:45:52.458 --> 01:45:53.833
Cat got your tongue?

01:45:53.958 --> 01:45:55.420
Stop pulling!

01:45:55.167 --> 01:45:56.125
Wait!

01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:59.250
You can't do that by yourself.
Raise your arms.

01:45:59.375 --> 01:46:00.875
What's up, Gran?

01:46:03.542 --> 01:46:04.958
Everyone wants something.

01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:08.500
They never think
he might be too old for it.

01:46:08.625 --> 01:46:10.750
Who's too old for what?

01:46:10.875 --> 01:46:15.875
Imam Veysel! He wants your grandpa
to sing the azan again today.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
So?

01:46:17.125 --> 01:46:19.167
He’s too old for it, love.

01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:21.625
I worry he'll get muddled.

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:23.583
If he gets muddled,

01:46:23.875 --> 01:46:26.167
we'll be a laughing stock!

01:46:27.333 --> 01:46:29.292
Where's the imam going?

01:46:29.958 --> 01:46:33.208
How do I know?
To a wedding, a funeral.

01:46:33.917 --> 01:46:36.125
I'm sick of these young imams!

01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:37.917
They're all the same.

01:46:38.542 --> 01:46:41.125
Then Grandpa could refuse to do it.

01:46:41.917 --> 01:46:43.583
Why did he agree?

01:46:43.708 --> 01:46:45.958
He's a soft touch.

01:46:46.333 --> 01:46:49.417
He borrowed two gold coins
and won't even give them back.

01:46:49.542 --> 01:46:51.542
-
mam Veysel?
-Yes.

01:46:52.875 --> 01:46:54.542
That's outrageous!

01:46:54.958 --> 01:46:58.750
I doubt we'll see that gold again.
He won’t ask for it back.

01:46:59.167 --> 01:47:00.333
Grandpa!

01:47:00.792 --> 01:47:01.917
Yes?

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:04.458
Did Veysel really
not give back the gold?

01:47:04.583 --> 01:47:05.958
What did you say?

01:47:06.417 --> 01:47:08.792
Veysel didn't give back the gold?

01:47:08.917 --> 01:47:12.125
No. He takes and takes
and never gives back.

01:47:12.625 --> 01:47:14.833
It defies belief.

01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:18.917
In all my years as an imam,
and she's my witness...

01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.750
I just worry he'll fluff the azan.

01:47:21.917 --> 01:47:24.667
God forbid!

01:47:24.792 --> 01:47:26.667
The villagers will have a field day.

01:47:26.792 --> 01:47:29.420
They’re always after gossip anyway.

01:47:30.333 --> 01:47:32.167
Look at these trousers.

01:47:32.333 --> 01:47:34.167
Are they too big?

01:47:34.708 --> 01:47:37.917
No. They aren't meant to hug you.

01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.708
And his only worry is his trousers!

01:47:39.833 --> 01:47:41.375
Give me that belt.

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:44.420
Low-rise is trendy now, Grandpa.

01:52:48.583 --> 01:52:50.125
Well, I'll be damned.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
I must have dozed off.

01:52:53.417 --> 01:52:54.458
When did you get here?

01:52:54.583 --> 01:52:56.625
What’s with sleeping in the sun?

01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:58.830
I was worried.

01:52:58.208 --> 01:53:00.500
It was shade when I lay down.

01:53:00.625 --> 01:53:04.292
Look at you, covered in ants.
How can you sleep like that?

01:53:04.417 --> 01:53:07.417
They know me. They don't sting.

01:53:08.417 --> 01:53:10.000
With the door and the well,

01:53:10.292 --> 01:53:12.250
I must've worn myself out.

01:53:12.375 --> 01:53:14.542
So you weren't running away
the praying time at the mosque?

01:53:14.875 --> 01:53:17.250
Well, there's that, too.

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:19.625
But the boulder was the main thing.

01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:21.542
I dug it out.

01:53:21.667 --> 01:53:25.830
So we just need to haul it out now.

01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:29.792
I'm going back to Can. Coming?

01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:31.958
Not until that boulder's out.

01:53:32.667 --> 01:53:35.875
If it rains midweek,
we're in trouble.

01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:38.000
OK, then.

01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:39.833
I'm off.

01:53:43.333 --> 01:53:44.167
What?

01:53:45.208 --> 01:53:46.375
Why are you laughing?

01:53:48.125 --> 01:53:50.375
You didn’t offer me a ride this morning.

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.420
So why now?

01:53:52.167 --> 01:53:54.583
I thought you wouldn't come
this morning.

01:53:55.292 --> 01:53:58.458
Why not?
Don’t I come here every weekend?

01:54:02.542 --> 01:54:04.958
I thought you might want
to go somewhere else today.

01:54:05.125 --> 01:54:07.625
Somewhere else? Where?

01:54:07.792 --> 01:54:09.375
How do I know?

01:54:10.167 --> 01:54:12.333
There must be places you miss.

01:54:13.542 --> 01:54:16.708
What does that mean?
What are you trying to say?

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.420
I'm not trying to say anything.

01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:25.208
Anyway, I'm going.

01:54:25.292 --> 01:54:27.500
OK, fine. Off you go.

01:54:28.875 --> 01:54:30.625
Let me pay his wage

01:54:30.875 --> 01:54:32.958
and get Mad Ahmet up here.

01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:36.830
Then I'll get a taxi back to Can.

01:54:43.542 --> 01:54:47.167
Look how I'm splashing out.
With what money?

01:54:47.833 --> 01:54:49.625
I didn't have a cent yesterday.

01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:52.208
And your mum has my bank card.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.708
Where did all this money
suddenly come from?

01:54:56.208 --> 01:54:57.625
Suspicious, isn't it?

01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:59.750
What are you talking about?

01:54:59.875 --> 01:55:01.125
Seriously.

01:55:01.833 --> 01:55:04.000
What kind of generosity is that now?

01:55:04.458 --> 01:55:05.500
Huh?

01:55:06.792 --> 01:55:09.667
And just when 300 lira
evaporated into thin air.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.830
-How do you know it was 300?
-Exactly! I wonder how I know?

01:55:15.292 --> 01:55:17.125
How do you think I know?

01:55:17.250 --> 01:55:17.958
Yes, how?

01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:21.420
Maybe I know more about it
than you.

01:55:22.333 --> 01:55:23.708
Think about it.

01:55:23.833 --> 01:55:25.625
How might I know?

01:55:27.167 --> 01:55:28.333
I may have told you.

01:55:28.458 --> 01:55:29.708
Bravo!

01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:33.667
You thought you'd cracked it there,
but no such luck.

01:55:33.875 --> 01:55:36.625
You need more evidence, Columbo!

01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:38.250
Don't talk crap.

01:55:38.375 --> 01:55:40.375
Follow your lead.

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.208
Use some logic.

01:55:42.333 --> 01:55:45.125
If it was the workman,
he'd have taken the lot.

01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:47.420
Why would he only take 300?

01:55:47.625 --> 01:55:49.375
-Right?
-So?

01:55:53.125 --> 01:55:55.833
So maybe it's screamingly obvious.

01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:57.625
Why do you keep agonizing?

01:56:00.125 --> 01:56:03.250
Look, if it wasn’t the workman,
who else could it be?

01:56:05.208 --> 01:56:06.417
Do you still not get it?

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:07.333
Get what?

01:56:07.417 --> 01:56:09.583
-You're all ears.
-No, I'm not.

01:56:11.917 --> 01:56:15.583
OK, you’re either messing around or...

01:56:15.708 --> 01:56:17.125
Yes, or?

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:18.292
Or what?

01:56:18.417 --> 01:56:19.667
C'mon, out with it.

01:56:20.875 --> 01:56:22.420
Or what?

01:56:24.708 --> 01:56:25.583
Say it.

01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:28.830
Or else what?

01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:32.250
Or else nothing.

01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:36.000
Anyway, I'm going.

01:56:36.125 --> 01:56:37.708
C'mon, or what?

01:56:37.833 --> 01:56:40.625
You were doing fine until "or what"?
What happened?

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.833
C'mon, or what?

01:56:42.958 --> 01:56:45.583
Columbo, I'm talking to you.
Columbo!

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.167
Columbo!

01:57:00.292 --> 01:57:02.167
He earns good money

01:57:03.208 --> 01:57:05.167
but he won't live there.

01:57:10.833 --> 01:57:12.750
He says that over there

01:57:12.875 --> 01:57:15.625
immorality is rampant.

01:57:15.792 --> 01:57:19.292
I met him at the mufti's.

01:57:20.125 --> 01:57:23.420
He works in Germany
and gets paid over there,

01:57:23.167 --> 01:57:26.250
as well as being paid here.

01:57:26.958 --> 01:57:29.917
It wasn't a problem before,

01:57:30.125 --> 01:57:34.250
but it's begun to bother me now.

01:57:35.375 --> 01:57:37.583
At that age, it's worrying.

01:57:39.375 --> 01:57:41.417
You have to be reasonable.

01:57:41.542 --> 01:57:43.000
True.

01:57:55.583 --> 01:57:57.292
Kids never get tired of playing.

01:58:02.625 --> 01:58:04.583
What's happening, Nazmi?

01:58:09.583 --> 01:58:11.125
It looks like earth.

01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:13.375
Kids I guess.

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:22.292
Do you want
to get us banished from Earth, too?

01:58:22.417 --> 01:58:23.917
Hey, Sinan!

01:58:24.542 --> 01:58:25.792
Was it you?

01:58:25.917 --> 01:58:29.542
Even you, Imam Veysel,
chasing after the forbidden fruit?

01:58:29.667 --> 01:58:30.750
It's a sin!

01:58:30.875 --> 01:58:32.830
Rubbish!

01:58:32.917 --> 01:58:34.583
Don't let the devil tempt you

01:58:34.708 --> 01:58:36.292
now that you're up there.

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:39.458
I got Nazmi a cable
for his minaret.

01:58:39.583 --> 01:58:41.958
On our way, we saw this tree...

01:58:42.958 --> 01:58:45.167
And the apples tempted you?

01:58:45.292 --> 01:58:49.000
Well, they're hard to resist.
Here. Try a bite.

01:58:51.375 --> 01:58:53.000
You're right.

01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:55.250
You gave us a fright, Sinan.

01:58:55.375 --> 01:58:59.333
Nazmi, push that tin closer.

01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:04.958
Nazmi...

01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:07.417
Sinan is our retired imam's grandson.

01:59:07.625 --> 01:59:10.208
He sang the noon azan today.

01:59:10.333 --> 01:59:11.583
Really? Great.

01:59:11.708 --> 01:59:13.417
I call him my deputy.

01:59:14.833 --> 01:59:18.420
Nazmi is the new imam
of Sofular Village

01:59:18.167 --> 01:59:19.750
and my friend from imam school.

01:59:19.875 --> 01:59:21.830
Really? Hello.

01:59:21.208 --> 01:59:21.917
Hello.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.708
So what are you up to?

01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:25.667
Struggling.

01:59:25.792 --> 01:59:28.708
College is done.
Now it's exams and jobs.

01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:30.542
I hear you're up here a lot.

01:59:30.625 --> 01:59:33.958
I guess.
Whenever I get the chance.

01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:36.830
I'm lucky to see you, imam.

01:59:36.208 --> 01:59:38.875
You were away again today.
A wedding, was it?

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Well...

01:59:40.625 --> 01:59:43.875
People send invitations.
It's hard to say no.

01:59:44.375 --> 01:59:48.458
The mufti’s wife’s who knows what
sent an invitation all the way here.

01:59:48.583 --> 01:59:50.542
What can you do?
I don't even know him.

01:59:50.667 --> 01:59:52.458
Go, of course.

01:59:52.583 --> 01:59:55.583
But don't keep offloading
the azan on my granddad.

01:59:55.917 --> 01:59:59.250
They're worried he'll get muddled.
The man's 80 and deaf.

01:59:59.375 --> 02:00:00.875
He won't get muddled.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.375
And so what if he does?

02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:05.500
A devout man like him
can be sure of God's mercy.

02:00:05.625 --> 02:00:10.583
What do villagers care about God's mercy?
He'd be a laughing stock.

02:00:10.708 --> 02:00:13.750
Don't worry.
Your grandad's strong as an ox.

02:00:14.250 --> 02:00:17.830
He helps me a lot, God bless him.

02:00:17.417 --> 02:00:21.420
-You mean he's your stand-in?
-Exactly. My apprentice!

02:00:22.375 --> 02:00:24.583
Good for the old war horse.

02:00:24.708 --> 02:00:26.375
Your back is covered in dirt.

02:00:32.292 --> 02:00:34.208
Where were you today?

02:00:34.333 --> 02:00:35.625
Karadoru Village.

02:00:36.167 --> 02:00:39.250
Do they always take gold there too?

02:00:39.375 --> 02:00:40.333
Sure!

02:00:40.458 --> 02:00:43.000
I thought as a migrant village
it might be different.

02:00:43.125 --> 02:00:46.667
No, just the same.
The place was awash with quarter golds.

02:00:47.167 --> 02:00:49.500
But there's something I don't get,
Imam Nazmi.

02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:54.625
I don't know if it's just me, but...

02:00:54.875 --> 02:00:58.542
Are these people not ashamed
of being so greedy?

02:00:58.667 --> 02:01:00.375
-Am I wrong?
-Frankly...

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:03.333
I'm not really sure
what you're talking about.

02:01:03.458 --> 02:01:05.420
The gold thing.

02:01:05.167 --> 02:01:07.500
A guy has a son, give him gold.

02:01:07.625 --> 02:01:09.292
His circumcision, more gold.

02:01:09.417 --> 02:01:11.833
He marries, divorces, gold, gold, gold.

02:01:11.958 --> 02:01:13.458
What's that all about?

02:01:13.542 --> 02:01:16.167
Misery and hardship, Sinan.
What else?

02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:18.875
It's different where I come from.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
But don't let it upset you.

02:01:21.125 --> 02:01:25.708
But why would you invite
a total stranger to a celebration?

02:01:25.833 --> 02:01:28.583
Isn't that openly asking for money.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.417
Some people won't pay off their debts

02:01:31.542 --> 02:01:35.542
but they would never dream
of not bringing gold to celebrations.

02:01:35.667 --> 02:01:37.333
I'm afraid you're right.

02:01:37.458 --> 02:01:39.833
-As Abu Zarr says...
-Who?

02:01:39.958 --> 02:01:43.500
Abu Zarr,
a companion of the Prophet.

02:01:43.625 --> 02:01:45.420
One of his favourites.

02:01:45.167 --> 02:01:46.833
The one banished to the desert?

02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:49.458
Bravo! You know him?

02:01:49.542 --> 02:01:53.830
-Am I supposed not to?
-No, of course not!

02:01:53.208 --> 02:01:56.333
But not everyone knows him.

02:01:56.458 --> 02:02:01.000
Not even most imams. Why?
They know the more popular companions.

02:02:01.125 --> 02:02:03.625
What are you talking about?

02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:05.958
What's popularity got to do with it?

02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:08.208
These are the Prophet's companions!

02:02:08.333 --> 02:02:11.958
But why do we always quote
the most well-known?

02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:14.458
Aren't there other important scholars
out there?

02:02:14.875 --> 02:02:16.830
Nazmi!

02:02:16.208 --> 02:02:19.625
Sometimes, when the spark is gone,

02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:23.167
people try to resurrect
secondary figures.

02:02:23.292 --> 02:02:24.958
That's what you're doing.

02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:28.792
The most important characters
are the most quoted.

02:02:28.917 --> 02:02:30.458
It's only natural.

02:02:30.583 --> 02:02:31.958
Don't make it

02:02:32.830 --> 02:02:34.000
an issue about recognition.

02:02:34.125 --> 02:02:38.500
I'm not saying we should
favour lesser-known people

02:02:38.625 --> 02:02:42.500
but simply look at
what they said and thought.

02:02:42.625 --> 02:02:44.958
OK,
see your point, but...

02:02:45.208 --> 02:02:47.125
You're a village imam now,

02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:50.292
not a student representative.

02:02:50.542 --> 02:02:52.750
You need to sort your ideas.

02:02:52.875 --> 02:02:55.625
The Muslim situation
speaks for itself.

02:02:56.125 --> 02:02:59.458
The world has changed
and left us behind.

02:02:59.583 --> 02:03:03.542
The world hasn't changed
nor have we been left behind.

02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:07.417
If you start reforming religion,
you open the door

02:03:07.542 --> 02:03:09.792
to every human fantasy.

02:03:09.917 --> 02:03:14.125
What you're saying is
the Koran is incapable

02:03:14.250 --> 02:03:15.625
of interpreting today's world.

02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:17.292
Which is preposterous!

02:03:17.417 --> 02:03:20.708
Some of your observations
seem valid,

02:03:20.833 --> 02:03:23.420
but your premise seems to be

02:03:23.167 --> 02:03:26.958
to resist change on principle.

02:03:27.292 --> 02:03:31.792
Then you want change
for the sake of change.

02:03:31.917 --> 02:03:35.750
But it isn't right to wear blinkers!

02:03:35.833 --> 02:03:38.792
God forbid,
I'm not talking about anything else

02:03:38.917 --> 02:03:41.875
but how does the Almighty
address us in the Koran?

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.375
As "people of understanding".
He asks, "don't you think?"

02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:49.792
You can look for anything in the Koran.
That's another story.

02:03:49.917 --> 02:03:52.625
The Koran is miraculous.

02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:54.583
Let's not go there, Nazmi.

02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:59.458
Plus, trawling the Koran
for arguments to have the last word

02:03:59.583 --> 02:04:02.167
is not very dignified.

02:04:02.292 --> 02:04:04.830
I'm not trawling for arguments.

02:04:04.208 --> 02:04:06.458
Imagine an architect doing a building.

02:04:06.583 --> 02:04:08.375
His work is detailed.

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:12.375
He gives the foreman a plan but
doesn't tell him how to lay the bricks.

02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:15.417
So the builders use their initiative

02:04:15.583 --> 02:04:19.333
and add their own interpretation
to the building.

02:04:19.458 --> 02:04:21.667
OK, but what does the Koran say?

02:04:21.833 --> 02:04:25.830
Yes, "People of understanding",
but also "dust".

02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:29.375
Remember the verse in the Holy Koran.

02:04:29.792 --> 02:04:32.958
"We shall regard their deeds
and scatter them like dust."

02:04:33.167 --> 02:04:34.667
It talks about dust!

02:04:34.792 --> 02:04:36.417
We humans are not much.

02:04:36.542 --> 02:04:38.875
What are we, in fact?

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
We're guided by the Holy Book,
the Prophet's deeds and sayings,

02:04:42.125 --> 02:04:45.583
community consensus and analogy.
Why look for alternatives?

02:04:45.708 --> 02:04:48.208
We all stick to those guidelines.

02:04:48.292 --> 02:04:51.830
If everyone made
their own prescription,

02:04:51.208 --> 02:04:55.792
there'd be as many religions in the world
as there are people.

02:04:55.958 --> 02:04:56.750
You see.

02:04:56.875 --> 02:04:59.125
But our prescription is signed.

02:04:59.250 --> 02:05:03.250
Signed by a doctor.

02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:07.420
We go to the pharmacy
and ask for a specific medicine.

02:05:07.167 --> 02:05:09.708
If they don't have it
they offer an equivalent,

02:05:09.833 --> 02:05:12.000
with the same active ingredient.

02:05:12.125 --> 02:05:13.958
There's no end to this discussion.

02:05:14.250 --> 02:05:16.125
It's all down to people.

02:05:17.125 --> 02:05:21.833
Speaking for myself,
the point I keep coming back to

02:05:21.958 --> 02:05:24.500
is the peaceful shade
of unquestioning submission.

02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:28.458
If you want to believe, you believe.
But if you think

02:05:28.583 --> 02:05:30.833
you can pierce the mystery

02:05:30.958 --> 02:05:35.500
and penetrate God's great wisdom
with your limited insight,

02:05:35.625 --> 02:05:37.625
that madness is your choice,

02:05:37.708 --> 02:05:40.708
but it's definitely not for me.

02:05:57.875 --> 02:05:59.917
-You're here?
-All done?

02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:03.583
Almost, but I'd like to check my sheep
before I'm done.

02:06:03.708 --> 02:06:05.375
-Will it take long?
-No.

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:08.208
-Bring it to the teahouse.
-OK.

02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:16.420
Is the bike yours?

02:06:16.167 --> 02:06:17.625
Yes,
just bought it.

02:06:17.958 --> 02:06:19.830
What do you think?

02:06:19.208 --> 02:06:22.420
Nice. May it serve you well,
as the saying goes.

02:06:22.167 --> 02:06:23.958
We say "may you wear it out".

02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:27.333
What were those old Eastern bloc bikes?

02:06:27.458 --> 02:06:29.458
MZs, Jawas...

02:06:29.583 --> 02:06:31.750
-And what was that Russian make?
-Minsk.

02:06:31.875 --> 02:06:33.667
Minks, right.

02:06:33.792 --> 02:06:36.420
With that massive ta-ta-ta sound.

02:06:36.208 --> 02:06:39.542
The mukhtar still has one
that stutters like that.

02:06:39.667 --> 02:06:41.542
To run after the big shots.

02:06:41.667 --> 02:06:43.167
How's the new mosque going?

02:06:43.292 --> 02:06:45.000
No idea.

02:06:45.125 --> 02:06:48.420
It's in the hands
of the mukhtar and village council.

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:51.625
So we're talking fancy windows,
shiny domes

02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:53.250
and automatic doors?

02:06:53.375 --> 02:06:55.583
No idea.
Everyone’s saying something.

02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:57.833
How can you not know?

02:06:57.917 --> 02:06:58.917
I keep out of it.

02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:03.792
When form takes precedence,
content suffers.

02:07:03.917 --> 02:07:07.250
In the Prophet's day
mosques and minarets didn't even exist.

02:07:07.375 --> 02:07:09.167
They're novelties, later additions.

02:07:09.292 --> 02:07:12.125
That's too harsh, Nazmi!

02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:15.000
It's a very complicated subject.
Don't get into it.

02:07:15.125 --> 02:07:17.625
I'm not out to criticize.

02:07:17.708 --> 02:07:21.830
So what if you do?
Isn't it worship that matters?

02:07:21.208 --> 02:07:23.625
Exactly, Sinan!

02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:27.292
In a palace or a hut,

02:07:27.417 --> 02:07:30.167
worship is worship.
No one disputes that.

02:07:30.875 --> 02:07:33.420
But with a negative outlook,

02:07:33.167 --> 02:07:35.830
you can always find faults.

02:07:35.208 --> 02:07:38.830
What matters here is intent and honesty.

02:07:38.208 --> 02:07:39.542
Honesty?

02:07:40.208 --> 02:07:42.917
How can we say that?

02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:44.625
without self-criticism?

02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:46.458
Isn't that an easy way out?

02:07:46.583 --> 02:07:48.875
Who needs to self-criticize?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.458
People like you who take the easy way.

02:07:51.583 --> 02:07:54.875
Now, Sinan.
We already pray every night.

02:07:55.500 --> 02:08:00.000
And through these prayers,
we reveal all our flaws and failings.

02:08:00.125 --> 02:08:01.583
Is there better self-criticism than that?

02:08:01.708 --> 02:08:02.958
So do what we like,

02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:06.917
then repent at night and relax.
La dolce Vita, isn't it?

02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:08.667
I'm not saying that, Sinan.

02:08:08.792 --> 02:08:10.958
Who would?

02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:13.583
Of course we can be weak.

02:08:13.708 --> 02:08:17.917
But a believer
should show common sense in all matters.

02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:20.167
You should be prudent and deliberate.

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:22.833
Why just believers?

02:08:22.958 --> 02:08:25.830
Does nobody else need common sense?

02:08:25.208 --> 02:08:29.958
No, but a believer tests himself
with a higher morality.

02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:32.917
And therefore
he feels extra responsibility.

02:08:33.125 --> 02:08:36.583
Maybe. But he feels it
because he’s been told he should.

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:38.958
Why would I want
responsibility on a plate?

02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:40.958
Nobody's more dependable

02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:44.833
than a person who's alone
with his conscience and free will.

02:08:44.958 --> 02:08:49.375
Because he builds this responsibility,
he doesn't receive it.

02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:53.417
So he must undertake
all the consequences of his acts.

02:08:53.542 --> 02:08:56.000
Who says free will is free?

02:08:56.125 --> 02:08:58.375
Even if it was,
how could you trust it?

02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:00.458
It’s not for everyone.

02:09:00.583 --> 02:09:05.208
Isn't that why people without the courage
choose servitude over existence?

02:09:05.333 --> 02:09:06.458
Arivers are born

02:09:06.583 --> 02:09:10.667
as furious waterfalls
but grow calm on their way to the sea.

02:09:10.792 --> 02:09:14.420
But your raging rivers drag along

02:09:14.167 --> 02:09:17.292
lots of pebbles and sticks, too.

02:09:17.417 --> 02:09:21.167
Just like strong characters drag
underdogs and losers with them?

02:09:21.292 --> 02:09:25.250
Exactly!
That's the point of faith or religion!

02:09:25.375 --> 02:09:28.625
How else do you control all those crowds?

02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:33.958
Wasn't it mostly believers who created
mountains of bones in the past?

02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:38.625
In trying to create order,
they were worse than the persecutors.

02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:40.958
Humanity can't get rid of it,
like rabies.

02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:44.420
If we generalize,
we're bound to make mistakes.

02:09:44.167 --> 02:09:46.667
The vast majority of people
are believers, aren't they?

02:09:46.833 --> 02:09:49.000
Because man’s moral backbone is faith.

02:09:49.125 --> 02:09:50.583
How can you say that?

02:09:50.708 --> 02:09:54.833
Why is the crime rate so low
in atheist countries then?

02:09:54.958 --> 02:09:59.500
That means being just and moral
has nothing to do with faith or religion.

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:03.667
Then wouldn't people feel all alone
in this vast universe?

02:10:03.792 --> 02:10:06.708
The crime rate may be low
in those countries,

02:10:06.833 --> 02:10:08.417
but the suicide rate is high.

02:10:08.542 --> 02:10:12.167
People don't commit crimes,
but they aren't happy either.

02:10:12.292 --> 02:10:13.458
Which would you prefer?

02:10:13.583 --> 02:10:17.792
Someone wrote that if the truth
was proven to be outside Islam,

02:10:17.917 --> 02:10:20.792
he'd rather choose Islam
than the truth.

02:10:20.917 --> 02:10:25.958
Which proves the famous argument that
faith is wanting not to know the truth.

02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:27.292
Doesn't it?

02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:29.250
No more questions, Your Honour.

02:10:29.375 --> 02:10:31.292
Faith is belief
in the unfathomable?

02:10:31.417 --> 02:10:32.458
What?

02:10:32.583 --> 02:10:34.458
Belief in the unknown.

02:10:34.583 --> 02:10:37.375
Sinan, look.
The bottom line is this.

02:10:37.917 --> 02:10:41.542
Would you want to live in a world
where God exists

02:10:41.667 --> 02:10:43.583
or one where he doesn't?

02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.917
If it was up to me,

02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:49.542
I'd want to live
in a world where He exists.

02:10:49.667 --> 02:10:50.917
Does that change anything?

02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:52.667
Change what?

02:10:52.792 --> 02:10:54.958
Does what I want
change anything?

02:10:55.583 --> 02:10:57.583
It's not about that.

02:10:57.708 --> 02:11:00.333
Wanting it

02:11:00.458 --> 02:11:02.833
allows you to feel it.

02:11:02.958 --> 02:11:05.542
What more can I say?

02:11:05.667 --> 02:11:07.708
I don't have the authority to say more.

02:11:09.375 --> 02:11:11.333
I don't have the authority.

02:11:12.625 --> 02:11:14.830
What do you say, Imam Nazmi?

02:11:14.375 --> 02:11:17.830
There's a poem by Yunus Emre.

02:11:17.208 --> 02:11:19.667
"I walk along a road,

02:11:19.792 --> 02:11:21.958
"I see a tree standing tall,

02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:24.208
"So charming, so sweet,

02:11:25.458 --> 02:11:26.792
"My heart..."

02:11:26.917 --> 02:11:28.625
How does it go?

02:11:29.125 --> 02:11:30.708
Yunus Emre...

02:11:34.583 --> 02:11:35.833
What did Ibn Arabi say?

02:11:35.958 --> 02:11:38.208
"The god you worship
is under my feet."

02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:39.500
They killed him!

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:42.542
A man of faith and they killed him!

02:11:42.667 --> 02:11:44.458
So what did he mean?

02:11:45.542 --> 02:11:46.875
He's back with your bike.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.333
No, he's off elsewhere.

02:11:51.917 --> 02:11:54.458
I lend the man the bike.

02:11:55.167 --> 02:11:56.000
He pretends not to see you!

02:11:56.125 --> 02:11:59.208
I didn’t lend it to him
so he could ride off-road.

02:11:59.833 --> 02:12:04.167
It's dirty and scratched.

02:12:04.875 --> 02:12:08.292
So whenever it rains,

02:12:08.417 --> 02:12:10.667
water goes in the scratches

02:12:10.792 --> 02:12:12.458
and you get rust and mould.

02:12:12.583 --> 02:12:15.420
You end up at the mechanic's

02:12:15.167 --> 02:12:17.792
and never get your bike back.

02:12:17.917 --> 02:12:20.417
You're down there every week.

02:12:30.875 --> 02:12:32.583
I was saying...

02:12:33.792 --> 02:12:35.000
You sit here.

02:12:42.667 --> 02:12:44.792
-What was it?
-She's started wearing the veil.

02:12:44.958 --> 02:12:45.833
What?

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.750
Janet Jackson's wearing the veil.

02:12:47.875 --> 02:12:48.625
Give me a break!

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:50.917
A load of bullshit.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.208
Fikret!

02:12:53.542 --> 02:12:54.875
Three teas!

02:13:11.625 --> 02:13:15.000
Talk about hard workers!
The man never stops.

02:13:15.375 --> 02:13:16.458
Who?

02:13:17.208 --> 02:13:18.625
Your dad.

02:13:19.125 --> 02:13:22.708
Idris is a great guy.
Forget what anyone else says.

02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:24.830
Good God!

02:13:24.208 --> 02:13:25.792
So he's a great guy?

02:13:26.667 --> 02:13:28.125
What do you mean by "great"?

02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:29.917
Good, conscientious.

02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:32.167
Don’t say things for the sake of it.

02:13:32.292 --> 02:13:34.000
Why would I?

02:13:34.125 --> 02:13:35.375
I meant it.

02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:37.875
Weekdays he teaches,

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.375
on weekends he works in the village.

02:13:40.542 --> 02:13:42.458
He'd hardly do it for fun.

02:13:42.583 --> 02:13:43.958
Of course not.

02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:45.958
But it sucks!

02:13:46.292 --> 02:13:49.833
No one can help.
It's his own decision.

02:13:50.708 --> 02:13:51.917
I mean...

02:13:52.708 --> 02:13:54.583
He was such a decent guy,

02:13:55.125 --> 02:13:56.292
such a gentleman.

02:13:56.417 --> 02:13:59.208
I don't know
how he got into stuff like that.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.750
There's nothing not to understand.

02:14:04.125 --> 02:14:08.792
His thing is basically
a revolt against the absurdity of life.

02:14:09.125 --> 02:14:11.958
But if, despite all the contradictions,

02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:14.208
you can stay positive,

02:14:14.333 --> 02:14:17.500
if you can curb your desires,
renounce yourself...

02:14:17.625 --> 02:14:19.417
Let's drop it. It's tricky.

02:14:19.542 --> 02:14:22.208
Then life won't seem absurd.

02:14:22.333 --> 02:14:25.167
We're all sloshing around
in a glass of water.

02:14:25.292 --> 02:14:28.292
Let's just call it fate and move on.

02:14:28.417 --> 02:14:32.292
Don't give me fate!
You're into easy answers now!

02:14:32.417 --> 02:14:35.750
Abuse, sins, crimes...
Are you calling them fate now?

02:14:36.125 --> 02:14:38.125
Disappointments are fate's fault.

02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:40.833
Successes are our own doing.

02:14:40.958 --> 02:14:44.250
That's how it is, Sinan.
You're so bitter.

02:14:44.375 --> 02:14:47.708
Let people find comfort where they can.

02:14:47.875 --> 02:14:49.292
What's wrong with that?

02:14:49.417 --> 02:14:51.208
You'll warn me about being

02:14:51.333 --> 02:14:53.125
on tricky ground again, but...

02:14:53.250 --> 02:14:54.917
Can we just leave it?

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.458
Look how nice it is instead.

02:14:57.792 --> 02:15:01.000
I can smell the earth again
since I stopped smoking.

02:15:05.708 --> 02:15:06.625
Are you done?

02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:07.917
Yes. Thanks.

02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:10.375
-You're back early.
-Yes. The key's in the bike.

02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:11.375
OK.

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.542
Thanks.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Who dumped that cement there?

02:15:15.125 --> 02:15:18.167
I don't know.

02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:22.333
Jump on, Sinan.
Let's feel that wind.

02:15:22.458 --> 02:15:23.292
What?

02:15:23.417 --> 02:15:25.958
I'll take you for a spin.

02:15:26.542 --> 02:15:28.917
We aren't kids, for God's sake!

02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:32.420
Why? We're riding it every day.

02:15:32.167 --> 02:15:34.750
Riding is one thing,
but "going for a spin"...

02:15:34.875 --> 02:15:37.542
-I don't need that.
-But the shock absorbers are wicked.

02:15:37.667 --> 02:15:38.625
Like a plane.

02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:39.667
That's my point!

02:15:39.792 --> 02:15:43.708
With gadgets getting so good,
sacred things no longer hit the spot.

02:15:43.958 --> 02:15:48.958
But there's more need
for spirituality than ever.

02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:52.458
As the Prophet said,
every age will get progressively worse,

02:15:52.583 --> 02:15:54.458
until Doomsday arrives.

02:15:54.583 --> 02:15:59.420
But with the role technology
plays in your lives,

02:15:59.542 --> 02:16:04.583
isn't it hard to embrace the arguments
you must advocate as imams?

02:16:04.958 --> 02:16:07.875
Do you have some other agenda here?

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.625
Is humanity doomed
because I ride a bike?

02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:14.375
Look at the state of the world
and you're hung up about my bike!

02:16:14.917 --> 02:16:18.417
Guys my age drive automatic cars

02:16:18.542 --> 02:16:20.000
and I'm stuck here...

02:16:20.125 --> 02:16:24.000
I heard the other day
about a pilgrim in Mecca,

02:16:24.125 --> 02:16:27.333
who threw his iPhone by mistake
during the stoning ritual.

02:16:27.458 --> 02:16:31.750
Myth merging with reality,
the abstract with the concrete.

02:16:31.875 --> 02:16:37.000
Has religion helped to rid communities
of bad habits, poverty and addiction?

02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:39.125
Yes. Isn't that what matters?

02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:41.541
And people's own reality?

02:16:41.666 --> 02:16:43.416
Doesn't religion also stop people

02:16:43.541 --> 02:16:45.416
attaining their own truth?

02:16:45.583 --> 02:16:48.708
Doesn’t it do that
by defining the world for them?

02:16:48.791 --> 02:16:53.833
How can you be so sure
what people really want?

02:16:54.666 --> 02:16:57.708
No one wants to find
their own truth or anything.

02:16:57.833 --> 02:17:00.666
So-called 'man' is always busy

02:17:00.791 --> 02:17:03.250
carving things out to his advantage.

02:17:03.375 --> 02:17:05.830
Continuously!

02:17:05.458 --> 02:17:06.666
On the contrary,

02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:09.541
people try to escape their reality.

02:17:10.416 --> 02:17:13.833
Everyone's busy saving their own ass!

02:17:14.250 --> 02:17:18.791
But isn't everyone bound
to each other by invisible threads?

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.830
Call it fate or call it causality.

02:17:24.291 --> 02:17:25.958
It makes no difference.

02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:31.833
But no one should consider themselves
pure as the driven snow.

02:17:36.750 --> 02:17:37.750
Yes.

02:17:38.541 --> 02:17:41.583
He may have lost a lot on the horses.

02:17:42.208 --> 02:17:44.708
His house, car, honour, pride,

02:17:44.791 --> 02:17:46.830
respectability.

02:17:48.333 --> 02:17:50.166
But aren't your salaries paid

02:17:50.291 --> 02:17:54.416
with the ill-gotten gains
of horse races or the lottery?

02:17:54.625 --> 02:17:57.833
Look, I wasn't implying
anything about your dad.

02:17:57.958 --> 02:18:01.541
If you're angry about that,
you've got the wrong idea.

02:18:01.666 --> 02:18:03.375
No, I'd say if I was offended.

02:18:04.375 --> 02:18:07.458
But still, I’d rather certain things
were clear before being discussed.

02:18:07.583 --> 02:18:08.958
Of course.

02:19:36.250 --> 02:19:38.830
Teachers car for sale

02:21:34.167 --> 02:21:36.792
The Wild Pear Tree

02:21:59.583 --> 02:22:01.167
Look who’s got it easy!

02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:04.830
If only all schools were as relaxed.

02:22:04.167 --> 02:22:05.167
Right?

02:22:06.583 --> 02:22:10.417
Things are cool here.
Not many students.

02:22:11.667 --> 02:22:14.292
What's up? Something wrong?

02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:17.583
-I'm just back from Qanakkale.
-So?

02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:20.542
Mum called.

02:22:21.542 --> 02:22:23.875
They've cut off the power.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.420
She said you get your overtime today.

02:22:26.417 --> 02:22:28.708
I've come to take it
to get the power back.

02:22:30.333 --> 02:22:32.292
There is no money.
It didn't come through.

02:22:35.250 --> 02:22:36.917
It didn't come through?

02:22:42.417 --> 02:22:44.375
So what do we do?
What do I tell her?

02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:46.292
How do I know?

02:22:46.667 --> 02:22:47.917
Say what you like.

02:22:49.708 --> 02:22:51.420
Merve!

02:22:51.292 --> 02:22:52.958
You want me to come over?

02:22:54.333 --> 02:22:55.667
Well, do you?

02:23:00.917 --> 02:23:01.875
OK, then.

02:23:02.917 --> 02:23:03.917
I'm going.

02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:05.125
OK.

02:24:37.625 --> 02:24:39.792
Why are you sleeping at this time?

02:24:40.750 --> 02:24:42.333
Did you see your dad?

02:24:42.458 --> 02:24:43.542
Yes.

02:24:44.375 --> 02:24:45.417
Is it fixed?

02:24:45.542 --> 02:24:47.417
No, he didn't give me the money.

02:24:47.542 --> 02:24:48.625
What do you mean?

02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:50.458
He claims he didn't get it.

02:24:51.792 --> 02:24:53.708
The payment didn't come through.

02:24:53.833 --> 02:24:55.792
He was supposed to get it today.

02:24:55.917 --> 02:24:57.458
He says he didn't.

02:24:57.583 --> 02:25:01.292
But he was filling in coupons
or something in the classroom.

02:25:01.708 --> 02:25:03.458
Wherever the money came from.

02:25:03.583 --> 02:25:07.792
-He was filling in coupons?
-Yes. Then he hid them with his arm.

02:25:07.917 --> 02:25:09.500
As if I wouldn't see it!

02:25:10.250 --> 02:25:12.625
Why didn't you stop him if you saw it?

02:25:12.708 --> 02:25:14.292
You could've taken the money.

02:25:14.417 --> 02:25:16.333
How? By fighting him?

02:25:16.458 --> 02:25:17.750
Why not?

02:25:17.875 --> 02:25:19.167
Fight.

02:25:19.292 --> 02:25:20.667
Aren't you a man?

02:25:20.792 --> 02:25:23.833
Sure, right.
In front of the students.

02:25:23.958 --> 02:25:27.830
If you don't, who will? Me?

02:25:27.458 --> 02:25:28.625
So you’re a namby-pamby?

02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:30.958
Mum, cut the crap!

02:25:31.167 --> 02:25:34.500
Didn’t I tell you to grab his pay
before he spent it?

02:25:34.708 --> 02:25:36.458
Did I send you for decoration?

02:25:36.875 --> 02:25:41.458
Didn’t you say the power’s off
and the fridge stinks?

02:25:41.917 --> 02:25:44.250
That your sister's studying
at a friend's?

02:25:44.375 --> 02:25:46.167
Stop it, Mum!

02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:48.667
You can borrow the money tomorrow.

02:25:48.875 --> 02:25:51.000
Sure! Begging is easy.

02:25:51.125 --> 02:25:52.250
You try it.

02:25:52.333 --> 02:25:55.292
Did I tell you to marry him?

02:25:55.875 --> 02:25:57.917
You have to take the bitter
with the sweet.

02:25:58.830 --> 02:26:01.833
You insisted despite everybody
trying to stop you.

02:26:01.958 --> 02:26:03.958
You're impossible to talk to.

02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:06.250
Am I supposed to not answer?

02:26:06.625 --> 02:26:10.542
You say the last word straight off.

02:26:11.250 --> 02:26:13.500
I can never confide in you.

02:26:35.875 --> 02:26:37.708
Anyway, here you go.

02:26:38.375 --> 02:26:39.375
That’s yours.

02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:42.375
What is it?

02:26:44.375 --> 02:26:46.292
So the book's out?

02:26:47.333 --> 02:26:49.542
-When did it come out?
-Today.

02:26:56.125 --> 02:26:57.667
For dearest Mum,

02:26:57.792 --> 02:27:01.420
It’s all thanks to you
and for you alone.

02:27:01.167 --> 02:27:02.375
Sinan

02:27:17.917 --> 02:27:19.583
Don't cry!

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.500
Why are you crying?

02:27:23.833 --> 02:27:26.667
So I'm not that useless after all.

02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:45.417
I'm so happy.

02:27:45.833 --> 02:27:49.125
I always knew you'd achieve something.

02:27:51.708 --> 02:27:54.625
I never lost my faith in that.
Never.

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:56.417
Sometimes...

02:27:56.542 --> 02:27:58.208
people badmouthed you,

02:27:58.333 --> 02:28:00.667
but I never listened.

02:28:04.167 --> 02:28:08.917
Some even said you weren't normal
or implied you were insane.

02:28:09.208 --> 02:28:11.750
You can't imagine
what I had to deal with.

02:28:11.875 --> 02:28:15.542
It’s normal to call someone insane
if no one understands them.

02:28:15.667 --> 02:28:18.292
They can go to hell.
I didn't believe any of them.

02:28:18.417 --> 02:28:21.208
I knew that because you were special,

02:28:21.333 --> 02:28:24.250
some of your ways were different.

02:28:24.750 --> 02:28:28.208
Let those backbiters see you now.

02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:29.500
This is...

02:28:30.208 --> 02:28:31.667
fantastic.

02:28:32.333 --> 02:28:34.420
Really fantastic!

02:28:34.167 --> 02:28:35.458
A great fat book.

02:28:35.583 --> 02:28:37.208
And lots of small print.

02:28:37.333 --> 02:28:39.208
I don't know how you wrote it.

02:28:39.333 --> 02:28:41.542
On an empty stomach, in hostels.

02:28:41.667 --> 02:28:43.417
I don't know how you managed.

02:28:43.542 --> 02:28:45.708
OK, Mum. Don't overdo it!

02:28:45.833 --> 02:28:48.125
All I've done is publish a book.

02:28:48.333 --> 02:28:50.250
We don't even know if it's good.

02:28:50.375 --> 02:28:51.542
If what's good?

02:28:51.625 --> 02:28:52.958
The book.

02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:57.542
It's written and published,
but will anyone actually like it?

02:28:57.667 --> 02:29:00.833
Of course they will!
Why wouldn't they?

02:29:01.667 --> 02:29:03.750
Or will it stir up a hornet's nest?

02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:06.792
Anger, disgust, resentment...

02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:10.292
maybe even court cases?

02:29:11.125 --> 02:29:12.625
Court cases?

02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:16.500
Who knows?
The truth isn't always popular.

02:29:16.833 --> 02:29:19.208
How did you find the money,
by the way?

02:29:19.333 --> 02:29:20.833
You said you didn't have any.

02:29:20.958 --> 02:29:23.625
I haggled.

02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:25.417
And borrowed a bit, too.

02:29:25.542 --> 02:29:26.625
But not much.

02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:29.830
Debt isn't Mr Loser's monopoly.

02:29:29.208 --> 02:29:31.333
It's my turn.

02:29:31.458 --> 02:29:34.583
And at least
mine is for a worthy cause.

02:29:35.417 --> 02:29:36.792
Don't say that.

02:29:36.917 --> 02:29:38.000
Say what?

02:29:38.125 --> 02:29:39.667
Mr Loser?

02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:43.458
That describes him well.

02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:45.792
What else can I call him?

02:29:45.917 --> 02:29:49.292
Or was he a winner once
and kept it hidden?

02:29:49.458 --> 02:29:51.583
He should be glad
to get off so lightly.

02:29:51.708 --> 02:29:54.375
True, he's been trouble.

02:29:54.917 --> 02:29:57.208
But it kills me at times
to see him like this.

02:29:57.333 --> 02:30:01.167
Oh, C'mon!
Make your bed and sleep in it.

02:30:02.667 --> 02:30:05.833
Well, let's see
who you end up marrying.

02:30:05.917 --> 02:30:06.833
God forbid!

02:30:06.917 --> 02:30:09.458
We haven't seen any girlfriends.

02:30:09.833 --> 02:30:10.833
Isn't there anyone?

02:30:11.125 --> 02:30:12.208
Of course not.

02:30:12.375 --> 02:30:13.292
Why?

02:30:13.542 --> 02:30:14.792
Why do you think?

02:30:14.958 --> 02:30:16.708
I'm a peasant. I'm poor.

02:30:17.292 --> 02:30:18.625
I'm unemployed.

02:30:19.375 --> 02:30:20.583
Isn't that enough?

02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:22.583
What do you mean, peasant?

02:30:22.708 --> 02:30:24.792
I'm not expecting a princess.

02:30:24.917 --> 02:30:27.167
Everyone's a peasant here.

02:30:27.292 --> 02:30:29.708
If I did marry,
she wouldn't be from here anyway.

02:30:30.333 --> 02:30:32.208
What's wrong with people from here?

02:30:32.333 --> 02:30:33.417
Forget it.

02:30:34.292 --> 02:30:36.708
You'd never understand.
There's no point.

02:30:36.792 --> 02:30:40.292
So you understand everything
and we understand nothing?

02:30:40.417 --> 02:30:44.625
Exactly, if this man
was the best you could do.

02:30:46.292 --> 02:30:47.500
What more can I say?

02:30:47.625 --> 02:30:49.167
What was I supposed to do?

02:30:49.958 --> 02:30:52.375
They'd lined up another man.

02:30:52.917 --> 02:30:55.417
But your dad was young, handsome,

02:30:55.583 --> 02:30:57.500
he had a way with words.

02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:59.917
-And he was educated as well.
-There you go!

02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:02.420
You shouldn't complain then.

02:31:03.208 --> 02:31:06.292
He had such an incredible way
with words...

02:31:06.875 --> 02:31:10.292
he'd make you stop dead
in your tracks.

02:31:11.833 --> 02:31:14.750
When everyone else
was talking about money

02:31:15.167 --> 02:31:17.792
and calculating who owned what,

02:31:18.625 --> 02:31:21.667
he spoke of the smell of the earth,
of lambs

02:31:21.792 --> 02:31:23.625
and the colour of the fields.

02:31:23.958 --> 02:31:25.625
That hasn't changed.

02:31:26.625 --> 02:31:30.625
Maybe we get annoyed now
when he talks like that,

02:31:30.750 --> 02:31:33.420
but in those days,

02:31:33.833 --> 02:31:36.420
I couldn't hear enough of it.

02:31:37.167 --> 02:31:38.917
And I was only 16.

02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:41.250
I'd never met anyone like him.

02:31:41.667 --> 02:31:43.833
So I ran away with him.

02:31:45.250 --> 02:31:46.792
But still,

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.167
if we were to turn back the clock

02:31:50.375 --> 02:31:52.333
and I was allowed to choose again,

02:31:52.458 --> 02:31:55.500
knowing what I know now,

02:31:57.375 --> 02:32:00.917
I'm sure I'd do the same thing
all over again.

02:32:02.250 --> 02:32:04.458
I mean,
I'd marry your dad again.

02:32:04.917 --> 02:32:07.542
Yes.
Crazy, maybe, but true.

02:32:07.667 --> 02:32:09.750
You're something else!

02:32:10.917 --> 02:32:14.917
He sold our home to fund his gambling
and you're still defending him!

02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:16.667
I'm not trying to defend him.

02:32:16.792 --> 02:32:18.417
I'm saying what I feel.

02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:21.167
You know what?

02:32:21.542 --> 02:32:23.417
You're all the same.

02:32:23.542 --> 02:32:25.792
You women, you're all crazy.

02:32:26.250 --> 02:32:28.000
No, we aren't the same.

02:32:28.125 --> 02:32:31.167
Yes you are. Believe me.

02:32:31.625 --> 02:32:35.208
Sometimes you think
this one's different,

02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:38.875
when lo and behold,
out comes the same old stuff.

02:32:39.875 --> 02:32:42.542
You're always so over-the—top.

02:32:42.667 --> 02:32:45.458
All that love,
all that mushy, gooey emotion,

02:32:45.583 --> 02:32:48.250
I don't get where it comes from.

02:32:49.417 --> 02:32:50.542
Take me, for example.

02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:52.917
I don't like people.

02:32:53.542 --> 02:32:56.833
I can't bring myself to.
What can I do?

02:32:57.125 --> 02:33:00.830
I have nothing
against animals or nature.

02:33:00.917 --> 02:33:04.458
But I have no patience with people.

02:33:04.583 --> 02:33:06.833
I can't stand them.

02:33:12.375 --> 02:33:14.667
If there's such a thing

02:33:14.958 --> 02:33:17.208
as a writer who loathes people.

02:34:19.667 --> 02:34:21.333
Good grief!

02:34:22.417 --> 02:34:23.667
Why's the fridge empty?

02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:26.000
Guess. I took it to the neighbours.

02:34:26.208 --> 02:34:27.667
But why?

02:34:27.917 --> 02:34:32.458
You even need to ask? There's no power!
You want the food to rot?

02:34:33.208 --> 02:34:34.375
OK.

02:34:36.542 --> 02:34:38.667
You didn't give Sinan any money.

02:34:39.125 --> 02:34:40.830
No, I didn't.

02:34:40.208 --> 02:34:41.250
Why not?

02:34:41.375 --> 02:34:43.830
I wonder why.

02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:45.875
Maybe the money didn't come through.

02:34:46.167 --> 02:34:47.958
Why not?

02:34:49.417 --> 02:34:51.583
How would I know, Asuman?

02:34:51.708 --> 02:34:54.250
Stop lying for goodness sake!

02:34:54.375 --> 02:34:55.375
What lies?

02:34:56.375 --> 02:34:59.375
I have to babysit at my age
because of you.

02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:00.833
You think it's easy?

02:35:00.958 --> 02:35:04.292
I've been babysitting for 25 years.
A whole army of kids.

02:35:04.375 --> 02:35:05.792
-It's not the same.
-Of course it is.

02:35:05.917 --> 02:35:07.500
No, it isn't.

02:35:09.792 --> 02:35:13.292
How many times have I told you?
No fights in front of the kids.

02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:16.833
The kids? You think they're blind?

02:35:16.958 --> 02:35:20.000
These fights damage the kids.
I know, I'm a teacher.

02:35:20.125 --> 02:35:22.625
A teacher! What kind?
A horses teacher?

02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:23.750
Stop that!

02:35:23.875 --> 02:35:26.667
If you had no money,
what were the coupons in the classroom?

02:35:26.792 --> 02:35:28.250
What coupons? What classroom?

02:35:28.333 --> 02:35:30.208
Spare me! Don't act it!

02:35:30.333 --> 02:35:33.792
I'm not, Asuman.
What the hell gives you that idea?

02:35:33.917 --> 02:35:35.958
Fine, carry on gambling!

02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:40.000
Let's just see
if you get to retire in one piece.

02:35:40.125 --> 02:35:44.375
Our only hope is that bonus.
I'm terrified you'll sabotage it.

02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:46.625
So carry on, keep gambling.

02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:03.583
What you did wasn't nice at all.

02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:05.750
-What?
-You know what!

02:36:07.292 --> 02:36:09.420
It's called snitching.

02:36:09.292 --> 02:36:10.542
And what makes you think

02:36:10.667 --> 02:36:12.542
I was doing the horses at school?

02:36:12.667 --> 02:36:15.667
-I saw!
-What did you see that I didn't?

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:18.500
Didn’t you hide a paper
when I came in?

02:36:18.625 --> 02:36:20.000
-Yes.
-So?

02:36:20.208 --> 02:36:21.917
Why didn't you ask me there?

02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:23.830
Ask what?

02:36:23.208 --> 02:36:24.792
You can't say things like that

02:36:24.917 --> 02:36:26.750
without being totally sure.

02:36:27.583 --> 02:36:29.708
You pass the sentence without a trial

02:36:29.792 --> 02:36:31.833
and execute it without shame.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.292
Aren't you above that?

02:36:33.417 --> 02:36:34.542
Don't give me that!

02:36:34.667 --> 02:36:37.458
Why hide it
if it wasn't a betting coupon?

02:36:58.958 --> 02:37:00.625
Have your betting coupon!

02:37:00.875 --> 02:37:02.375
It's all a game.

02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:04.375
All I do is gamble.

02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:05.708
There, take it.

02:37:29.625 --> 02:37:31.792
Lost dog!

02:37:46.458 --> 02:37:49.125
What was he throwing away?

02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:50.000
Nothing.

02:37:50.833 --> 02:37:54.750
He says he was drawing
a "lost dog" poster.

02:37:56.125 --> 02:37:58.292
I think he’s making it up.

02:38:02.417 --> 02:38:06.875
I woke up the other night
and found him gone from the bed.

02:38:07.208 --> 02:38:10.750
There was an odd whine
coming from far away.

02:38:11.625 --> 02:38:15.458
I got up, went to the living room
and found him there.

02:38:15.583 --> 02:38:16.917
He was crying in the dark.

02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:18.875
What? How do you mean?

02:38:19.167 --> 02:38:20.420
Crying?

02:38:20.167 --> 02:38:25.208
He was whimpering
like I've never heard before.

02:38:25.333 --> 02:38:27.250
-Good God!
-Like he had stomach pains.

02:38:27.375 --> 02:38:28.458
Why was he crying?

02:38:28.542 --> 02:38:30.875
His dog's missing, you know.

02:38:31.542 --> 02:38:32.917
Weird.

02:38:33.583 --> 02:38:35.833
Has he really made
such a big deal of it?

02:38:35.958 --> 02:38:37.250
Even worse.

02:38:38.208 --> 02:38:41.875
You feel sorry for him
and annoyed at the same time.

02:38:42.250 --> 02:38:46.250
Because I know, God forbid,
that if anything happened to one of us,

02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:48.625
he wouldn’t turn a hair.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.708
But when a mere dog goes missing,
what dramas!

02:38:52.833 --> 02:38:55.417
Posters on walls, poles, posts.

02:38:55.542 --> 02:38:57.250
Nightmares at night.

02:38:58.292 --> 02:38:59.750
Good God!

02:39:00.167 --> 02:39:01.125
That’s kind of surprised me.

02:39:01.208 --> 02:39:05.250
His dog is the only living thing
that doesn’t judge him.

02:39:06.417 --> 02:39:07.417
He says so, too.

02:39:07.542 --> 02:39:08.750
Did he really say that?

02:39:08.875 --> 02:39:09.875
Yes.

02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:14.667
That’s really funny.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.625
It’s started snowing.

02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:12.667
What happened to those?

02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:16.208
I told you.
Not even a minute.

02:42:16.833 --> 02:42:18.875
-What happened?
-Don't ask.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:23.333
We moved them by the boiler
so they wouldn't get trampled on.

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:25.667
We worried you might be angry, though.

02:42:25.792 --> 02:42:28.000
Then Murphy's Law struck.

02:42:28.125 --> 02:42:30.167
Rain leaked through the window.

02:42:30.292 --> 02:42:34.420
The packets got damp,
but nothing serious.

02:42:35.250 --> 02:42:37.708
A few are discoloured, that's all.

02:42:37.833 --> 02:42:39.917
None of them are creased.

02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:41.958
Well, not really.

02:42:43.583 --> 02:42:45.833
So tell me, have you read it?

02:42:46.833 --> 02:42:49.292
You started it, Yasemin.
Did you finish?

02:42:49.417 --> 02:42:52.420
I have no time after studying.

02:42:52.167 --> 02:42:54.830
It didn't go anywhere.

02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:55.750
That's true.

02:42:55.875 --> 02:42:57.917
But you changed the fridge?

02:42:58.458 --> 02:43:00.750
Fridge, extractor, her laptop,

02:43:00.875 --> 02:43:02.750
her phone, our debts...

02:43:02.875 --> 02:43:05.292
That used up the retirement bonus.

02:43:06.792 --> 02:43:09.417
So where's the shepherd?
In the village?

02:43:10.167 --> 02:43:13.420
The shepherd barely comes back now.

02:43:14.250 --> 02:43:17.292
No wonder it's so quiet in the house.

02:43:18.417 --> 02:43:21.625
I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:25.000
The shepherd's living
in his father's storeroom.

02:43:25.208 --> 02:43:26.417
What storeroom?

02:43:26.542 --> 02:43:30.458
That damp, rat-infested room
under the house.

02:43:31.167 --> 02:43:32.417
There you go.

02:43:32.958 --> 02:43:34.542
He's found his place.

02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:38.250
Father and son can build a love nest.

02:43:38.375 --> 02:43:40.000
Very!

02:44:35.958 --> 02:44:36.958
Hi.

02:44:37.875 --> 02:44:40.000
Hey! How are you?

02:44:40.125 --> 02:44:42.125
Good. How about you?

02:44:42.250 --> 02:44:44.167
Not bad. Struggling along.

02:44:44.458 --> 02:44:47.708
I wanted to ask about my book sales.

02:44:47.833 --> 02:44:48.917
How did it go?

02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:50.250
What was it?

02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:52.830
The Wild Pear Tree.

02:44:52.292 --> 02:44:54.708
Ah, wild pear. OK.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.167
I remember now.

02:44:59.292 --> 02:45:02.420
We had it on display for 4-5 months,
but it didn't sell.

02:45:02.167 --> 02:45:04.458
So we took it off the shelves.

02:45:04.583 --> 02:45:05.875
Really?

02:45:06.167 --> 02:45:08.667
-Not a single sale?
-No.

02:45:09.917 --> 02:45:11.833
I'll give them back if you like,

02:45:11.958 --> 02:45:14.375
or we can have another go in summer.

02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:15.833
Keep them here.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:21.125
OK.

02:45:21.458 --> 02:45:23.125
I'll drop by again.

02:45:23.833 --> 02:45:25.833
-Have a good day.
-Thanks.

02:45:41.542 --> 02:45:44.420
The Lost Children of Ida

02:49:05.250 --> 02:49:08.250
Literature in Qanakkale - Sinan Karasu

02:52:05.792 --> 02:52:06.625
Jamukha!

02:52:06.750 --> 02:52:07.667
Quiet boy!

02:52:10.250 --> 02:52:11.417
Well, well!

02:52:12.208 --> 02:52:13.417
Welcome.

02:52:13.708 --> 02:52:14.917
Good to have you back.

02:52:15.420 --> 02:52:16.830
Thanks.

02:52:16.333 --> 02:52:17.708
Are you done now?

02:52:17.875 --> 02:52:18.750
I guess.

02:52:18.917 --> 02:52:20.167
That's good.

02:52:26.958 --> 02:52:28.833
How do you like my new palace?

02:52:30.500 --> 02:52:31.500
Good.

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:33.833
And my new friends?

02:52:34.250 --> 02:52:35.667
No expense spared!

02:52:39.250 --> 02:52:41.125
-So how are you doing?
-Not bad.

02:52:41.250 --> 02:52:43.875
You're lucky to catch me here.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:45.458
I was just off to get some bales.

02:52:45.583 --> 02:52:47.917
Yucel has super-dry ones
at the old school.

02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:49.375
I was going there.

02:52:50.542 --> 02:52:52.250
So, was it tough?

02:52:52.375 --> 02:52:54.625
No, but only time drags on.

02:52:54.958 --> 02:52:57.292
It's the same day in, day out.

02:52:58.583 --> 02:53:00.375
So how are you getting the bales here?

02:53:00.667 --> 02:53:02.917
Yucel has a pickup truck.

02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:05.458
He's got a tractor, too,
but forget that.

02:53:05.875 --> 02:53:07.458
Let's go then.

02:53:07.583 --> 02:53:08.458
What?

02:53:08.667 --> 02:53:09.542
Really?

02:53:09.667 --> 02:53:10.583
Yes.

02:53:10.833 --> 02:53:13.420
Let's get the sheep inside then.

02:53:13.167 --> 02:53:15.500
And let's get that done.

02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:17.208
It's turned out well.

02:53:17.333 --> 02:53:18.333
You got back yesterday?

02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:19.583
Yes.

02:53:20.292 --> 02:53:22.250
Have you seen your grandad?

02:53:22.375 --> 02:53:24.917
No. I checked your room
then came here.

02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:27.625
-He's all steamed up again.

02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:29.417
About that room being his.

02:53:29.542 --> 02:53:30.375
Grandad?

02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:31.417
Yes.

02:53:33.875 --> 02:53:37.708
He's telling the world
he'll throw me out if I annoy him.

02:53:38.542 --> 02:53:40.500
So I stay here mostly.

02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:42.000
I keep away from there.

02:56:22.125 --> 02:56:24.792
They love this stuff.
They eat a ton of it.

02:56:24.917 --> 02:56:27.125
I plan to grow some next year.

02:56:27.333 --> 02:56:29.792
Buying it

02:56:29.917 --> 02:56:31.667
costs too much.

02:56:32.833 --> 02:56:34.292
I'm worn out.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.708
How's the well by the way?

02:56:37.833 --> 02:56:39.958
-Is it done?
-The less said the better.

02:56:40.208 --> 02:56:42.125
The villagers were right this time.

02:56:42.250 --> 02:56:43.833
I didn't find any water.

02:56:44.167 --> 02:56:45.375
What?

02:56:46.167 --> 02:56:47.375
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:49.792
I dug 10 metres deep and still nothing.

02:56:50.420 --> 02:56:53.830
All that time and effort wasted.

02:56:53.542 --> 02:56:54.667
Forget digging a well...

02:56:54.792 --> 02:56:57.792
it was more like
a journey to the centre of the Earth.

02:57:01.375 --> 02:57:03.458
So you're admitting defeat?

02:57:03.583 --> 02:57:04.875
Exactly.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:06.500
If I'd been proven right

02:57:07.208 --> 02:57:10.583
it would've been good.

02:57:10.708 --> 02:57:13.420
But it's too bad, I wasn't.

02:57:13.167 --> 02:57:14.958
They proved to be right again.

02:57:18.250 --> 02:57:20.625
But never mind.

02:57:20.958 --> 02:57:22.333
That’s fine, too.

02:57:22.458 --> 02:57:24.875
"A timely retreat is a victory."

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:26.875
That’s my consolation.

02:57:31.958 --> 02:57:32.917
So?

02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:34.833
Military service is over.

02:57:34.958 --> 02:57:36.667
What are you going to do now?

02:57:36.917 --> 02:57:38.208
I don't know.

02:57:38.625 --> 02:57:41.917
Either teach in the East
and waste my youth like you

02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:44.250
Or get some irrelevant job here

02:57:44.375 --> 02:57:46.292
and waste my youth that way.

02:57:48.292 --> 02:57:50.000
What do you think I should do?

02:57:50.833 --> 02:57:54.833
Everyone has different expectations.

02:57:55.458 --> 02:57:59.667
If you love what you do,
you can survive anywhere.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Like most teachers, I started out
in the desolate villages of the East.

02:58:04.125 --> 02:58:05.417
As you well know.

02:58:05.708 --> 02:58:07.875
Terrorism was at its peak then.

02:58:08.292 --> 02:58:11.833
I'd dreamt of other things,
but never mind.

02:58:13.250 --> 02:58:15.542
Whose dreams come true just like that?

02:58:15.667 --> 02:58:19.420
I experienced so much.
I met such incredible people.

02:58:19.458 --> 02:58:22.667
I've forgotten most of it,
but even forgetting has its appeal.

02:58:22.792 --> 02:58:25.333
People should float in time a little.

02:58:25.417 --> 02:58:27.583
Good and bad memories should merge

02:58:27.708 --> 02:58:30.000
and dim and melt away.

02:58:30.417 --> 02:58:32.458
There are those that should stay, too.

02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:35.125
Carving a notch in time.

02:58:35.458 --> 02:58:38.830
You address the time thing in your book,
for example.

02:58:38.208 --> 02:58:39.542
I liked that.

02:58:40.667 --> 02:58:41.958
Have you read the book?

02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:44.420
Of course I have.

02:58:44.375 --> 02:58:46.792
And I've even read some parts twice.

02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:48.167
Really?

02:58:50.708 --> 02:58:52.125
Are you serious?

02:58:52.417 --> 02:58:54.417
Of course I am. Why?

02:58:55.958 --> 02:58:57.167
I don't know.

02:58:57.917 --> 02:59:01.458
It's the first time
I've come across anyone who's read it.

02:59:01.792 --> 02:59:03.625
I'm kind of surprised.

02:59:20.875 --> 02:59:21.917
Here it is.

02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:23.958
My best friend!

02:59:25.333 --> 02:59:29.167
And don't think I didn't notice
where you talk about me.

02:59:29.292 --> 02:59:31.958
You don’t say great things about me,

02:59:32.830 --> 02:59:33.292
but that's how it should be.

02:59:33.417 --> 02:59:36.250
The young should criticize the old.

02:59:36.417 --> 02:59:38.667
That's how progress works.

02:59:38.792 --> 02:59:41.667
It wasn't really
meant as criticism, but...

02:59:43.167 --> 02:59:45.333
Did you read
the "Wild Pear Tree" chapter?

02:59:45.458 --> 02:59:46.500
Of course.

02:59:46.625 --> 02:59:48.500
Oh, for wild pears!

02:59:49.292 --> 02:59:53.000
I got that from what you told us
at primary school.

02:59:53.125 --> 02:59:55.625
I'm glad to have been some use.

02:59:56.167 --> 02:59:58.833
In those days, school teachers

02:59:58.958 --> 03:00:02.250
were freer to stray
from the curriculum.

03:00:02.417 --> 03:00:04.250
A good thing, too!

03:00:05.167 --> 03:00:08.958
We could stretch the curriculum
according to the region.

03:00:09.417 --> 03:00:11.417
Without upsetting the balance.

03:00:12.542 --> 03:00:14.500
So I told you things like that, yes.

03:00:14.625 --> 03:00:17.458
There was a wild pear tree
opposite the school.

03:00:17.625 --> 03:00:19.125
You showed it to us.

03:00:19.250 --> 03:00:20.708
You're right.

03:00:20.833 --> 03:00:23.125
There's one over there, too.

03:00:24.250 --> 03:00:28.292
You know, sometimes things I see
in you, me and even Grandad

03:00:28.375 --> 03:00:30.625
remind me of a wild pear tree.

03:00:31.125 --> 03:00:34.542
I don't know.
We're all misfits, solitary,

03:00:34.667 --> 03:00:35.958
misshapen.

03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:38.917
Everyone has their own temperament.

03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:41.708
The thing is
being able to accept and like it.

03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:45.000
The fruit of wild pears
is misshapen like you say.

03:00:45.125 --> 03:00:48.708
But I have it for breakfast some days
and it's so good.

03:00:48.833 --> 03:00:54.000
My point is, yes, human nature is
as full of oddities as animal nature.

03:00:54.375 --> 03:00:59.000
I grew up here, for example,
but I mixed up dog and jackal tracks.

03:00:59.125 --> 03:01:02.458
Turns out there’s a small bulge
at the back of a jackal print.

03:01:02.708 --> 03:01:04.208
Do you still get jackals here?

03:01:04.333 --> 03:01:05.542
Absolutely!

03:01:06.830 --> 03:01:09.125
We'll hear them howling
down by the stream.

03:01:09.417 --> 03:01:10.375
What was I saying?

03:01:11.458 --> 03:01:13.375
A sheep went missing once.

03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:14.958
No sign of it anywhere.

03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:17.250
I thought the jackals got it.

03:01:17.375 --> 03:01:19.708
I felt sad and got over it.

03:01:20.708 --> 03:01:22.833
One evening, going back to the village,

03:01:23.125 --> 03:01:25.750
I heard a cry in the forest.

03:01:25.875 --> 03:01:28.958
I walked on, ears pricked.
And what did I see?

03:01:29.208 --> 03:01:32.167
She’d given birth in the forest.
Twins.

03:01:32.625 --> 03:01:34.542
The lambs weren't standing yet.

03:01:34.667 --> 03:01:37.542
I picked them up and brought them here.

03:01:40.333 --> 03:01:41.500
There.

03:01:41.625 --> 03:01:42.917
Listen.

03:01:43.583 --> 03:01:45.000
The concert has begun.

03:01:49.958 --> 03:01:51.417
Is that a jackal?

03:01:51.792 --> 03:01:53.167
It certainly is.
