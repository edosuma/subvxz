00:41.807 --> 00:44.627
THE SEVENTH SEAL

01:32.000 --> 01:34.500
It is the middle of the 14th Century.

01:34.700 --> 01:40.001
Antonius Block and his squire, after long years
as crusaders in the holy land...

01:40.101 --> 01:44.000
have at last returned to their native Sweden.
A land ravaged by the black plague.

02:00.177 --> 02:05.177
And when the Lamb
opened the seventh seal,

02:05.307 --> 02:08.893
there was in heaven a silence

02:08.894 --> 02:13.272
which lasted about the space
of half an hour.

02:13.273 --> 02:18.273
And the seven angels
who had the seven trumpets

02:19.113 --> 02:24.003
prepared themselves to sound.

04:17.271 --> 04:21.983
- Who are you?
- I am Death.

04:21.983 --> 04:26.321
- Have you come to fetch me?
- I have long walked at your side.

04:26.322 --> 04:30.408
- That I know.
- Are you ready?

04:30.409 --> 04:34.519
My body is, not myself.

04:41.712 --> 04:45.757
- Wait a moment.
- You all say that.

04:45.758 --> 04:50.758
- But I leave no respite.
- You play chess, don't you?

04:50.805 --> 04:55.805
- How do you know?
- From paintings and folk songs.

04:55.935 --> 05:00.480
Yes, I'm actually
quite a skilful chess player.

05:00.481 --> 05:04.484
- Not more so than me.
- Why play chess with me?

05:04.485 --> 05:09.485
- That's my affair.
- You are right.

05:09.740 --> 05:12.909
The condition is I live
as long as I resist you.

05:12.910 --> 05:17.910
If I conquer you, you free me.

05:23.004 --> 05:25.674
You have black.

05:26.090 --> 05:31.090
It's most appropriate, isn't it?

06:41.457 --> 06:46.253
Squeezed twixt the thighs
On a bed of sighs

06:46.254 --> 06:49.631
That's the only way to be

06:49.632 --> 06:52.842
For a man like me

06:58.099 --> 07:02.978
Our Lord sits up high
He is somewhat shy

07:02.979 --> 07:07.979
But Satan, your crony
Ensures you won't be lonely

07:09.443 --> 07:13.697
They talk of omens
and other horrors in Färjestad.

07:13.698 --> 07:16.908
Two horses ate
one another last night.

07:16.909 --> 07:21.909
Graves had been opened in the cemetery
and remains scattered about.

07:23.499 --> 07:28.499
There were four suns in the heavens
yesterday afternoon.

07:46.147 --> 07:51.147
Can you tell me the way to the inn?

08:13.340 --> 08:17.301
- Did he indicate the way?
- Not exactly.

08:17.302 --> 08:20.054
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

08:20.055 --> 08:23.432
- Was he dumb?
- No, one can't say that.

08:23.433 --> 08:28.228
I'd say that he was
extremely well-spoken.

08:28.229 --> 08:33.229
Yes, well-spoken. But the speech
he made was dour. I have to say.

10:04.742 --> 10:09.663
Good morning.
Have you had any breakfast?

10:09.664 --> 10:14.042
Unfortunately, I can't eat grass.
Can't you teach me?

10:14.043 --> 10:19.043
Things are tight. People aren't
interested in art in these parts.

11:14.270 --> 11:19.024
Mia, wake up! I've seen something
I must tell you about.

11:19.025 --> 11:22.528
- Has something happened?
- I've had a vision.

11:22.529 --> 11:26.573
No, not a vision.
It was like it was real.

11:26.574 --> 11:31.574
I see... Have you had another vision?

11:33.248 --> 11:36.488
I saw her, anyway.

11:36.626 --> 11:41.626
- Who? Who did you see?
- The Holy Virgin Mary.

11:43.466 --> 11:47.219
- Really?
- She was so close I could touch her.

11:47.220 --> 11:50.931
She had a crown of gold
and a blue dress with flowers,

11:50.932 --> 11:54.810
and she was barefoot
and had small brown hands.

11:54.811 --> 11:58.605
She held the child
and taught him to walk.

11:58.606 --> 12:03.068
Then she saw that I'd seen her
and she smiled at me.

12:03.069 --> 12:08.069
I got tears in my eyes and when
I wiped them away, she disappeared.

12:08.449 --> 12:13.161
And it became
utterly, utterly quiet everywhere.

12:13.162 --> 12:18.162
In heaven and on earth.
Can you understand that?

12:19.544 --> 12:24.544
- The things you come up with.
- You don't believe me, but it was real.

12:25.508 --> 12:30.304
Not your kind of reality,
but another reality.

12:30.305 --> 12:35.305
Like when you said the Devil painted
our wagon wheels red using his tail.

12:36.436 --> 12:38.894
Why bring that up?

12:38.895 --> 12:43.895
- Red paint was under your nails.
- Yes, that time it was made up.

12:43.942 --> 12:48.696
I did it so you'd believe in
my other visions. The real ones.

12:48.697 --> 12:53.697
Control your visions, or you'll be
taken for a fool, which you aren't.

12:54.328 --> 12:59.081
At least not yet, as far as I know.
But one never knows.

12:59.082 --> 13:04.082
I didn't ask for my visions! I can't
help the Holy Virgin revealing herself

13:05.047 --> 13:08.758
and that angels and devils
like to be with me.

13:08.759 --> 13:13.759
Haven't I said it once and for all
that I need to sleep in the morning?

13:14.348 --> 13:18.351
I've asked you, begged you,
but nothing helps.

13:18.352 --> 13:23.352
That's why I'm now saying... Quiet!

13:33.784 --> 13:37.954
Mikael, Mikael, Mikael...

13:47.214 --> 13:52.214
- He should have a better life than us.
- Mikael will be a great acrobat.

13:52.594 --> 13:57.390
Or maybe a juggler who accomplishes
the only impossible trick.

13:57.391 --> 14:01.894
- What trick is that?
- Make one ball remain still in the air.

14:01.895 --> 14:06.895
- It's impossible.
- For us it is. But not for him.

14:08.318 --> 14:12.608
You and your fantasies...

14:12.948 --> 14:17.948
I made up a new song last night.
I lay awake almost all night.

14:18.704 --> 14:23.704
- Do you want to hear my song?
- Sing it. I'm really curious.

14:23.959 --> 14:28.959
There sits a dove on the lily
In the midst of summer

14:31.383 --> 14:35.720
She sings her fair song of Jesus Christ

14:35.721 --> 14:40.721
There is great rejoicing in heaven

14:42.477 --> 14:47.477
- Mia, are you asleep?
- It was a very beautiful song.

14:47.816 --> 14:52.403
- It's not finished yet.
- I'm just going to sleep a little more.

14:52.404 --> 14:57.404
- You can sing the rest later.
- You just sleep and sleep.

14:58.660 --> 15:03.497
Is this disguise worthy of an actor?
I'm only asking.

15:03.498 --> 15:07.752
- If the priests didn't pay, I'd refuse.
- Are you playing Death?

15:07.753 --> 15:12.214
Frighten decent people out of their wits
with such nonsense.

15:12.215 --> 15:16.427
- When are we going to do it?
- At the All Saints Festival in Elsinore.

15:16.428 --> 15:19.930
On the actual church steps. Not bad.

15:19.931 --> 15:24.643
Why not something bawdy?
People like it and it's funnier.

15:24.644 --> 15:29.644
Idiot. There's an evil sickness about

15:29.691 --> 15:34.069
and priests are preaching
grim death and moral bellyaches.

15:34.070 --> 15:38.449
- What roles will we play?
- You're the human soul, you twit.

15:38.450 --> 15:43.450
- Naturally it's a bad role.
- Who decides? Who's the manager?

15:45.707 --> 15:50.707
You fools, keep this law in mind.
Life's thread is of the weakest kind.

15:53.006 --> 15:57.676
Life is short, you will find.

15:57.677 --> 16:02.677
Will women love me in this costume?
I'm only asking.

16:14.694 --> 16:19.532
Jof? Stand perfectly still.
Don't say anything.

16:19.533 --> 16:24.533
- I'm quiet as a mouse.
- I love you.

16:52.607 --> 16:56.277
- What are you painting?
- The dance of Death.

16:56.278 --> 17:00.364
- That's Death?
- Yes, he dances away with them all.

17:00.365 --> 17:05.365
- Why paint such daubings?
- To remind people they will die.

17:05.662 --> 17:10.290
- That won't make them happier.
- Why always make them happy?

17:10.291 --> 17:14.712
- Why not frighten them a bit?
- They'll just close their eyes then.

17:14.713 --> 17:19.713
Believe me, they'll look. A skull is more
interesting than a naked wench.

17:20.385 --> 17:25.384
- And if you frighten them?
- They'll think and be more frightened.

17:25.931 --> 17:29.726
- And rush into the priest's embrace.
- Not my business.

17:29.727 --> 17:34.480
- You're just painting Death's dance.
- I'm only showing how it is.

17:34.481 --> 17:39.481
- You'll anger certain people.
- Then I'll paint something cheerful.

17:40.404 --> 17:45.404
One has to make a living.
At least until the plague claims you.

17:45.534 --> 17:48.703
The plague? That's horrifying.

17:48.704 --> 17:53.499
You should see the boil
on the neck of the sick.

17:53.500 --> 17:58.500
See how the body contracts, until
his limbs become a rope of madness.

18:02.301 --> 18:06.304
- It doesn't look good.
- Yes... It doesn't look good.

18:06.305 --> 18:10.475
He's trying to tear
the bubo out of his bed.

18:10.476 --> 18:15.476
He gnaws at his hands,
rips out his veins with his nails.

18:15.606 --> 18:19.776
His scream is heard everywhere.

18:19.777 --> 18:22.862
- Are you scared?
- Scared? Me?

18:22.863 --> 18:27.033
You don't know me.
What nonsense is that you've painted?

18:27.034 --> 18:31.037
The strange thing is that people see

18:31.038 --> 18:34.499
the plague
as a punishment from God.

18:34.500 --> 18:39.500
Supplicants trail through the land
and whip themselves into God's favor.

18:41.924 --> 18:46.636
- They beat themselves?
- Yes, it's an awful sight.

18:46.637 --> 18:51.637
You want to run and hide
when they come.

18:51.809 --> 18:55.520
Have you got any schnapps?
I've been drinking water all day.

18:55.521 --> 19:00.521
- I'm thirsty as a camel in the desert.
- You did get a little scared, after all.

19:30.931 --> 19:35.931
I want to confess as honestly as I can,
but my heart is empty.

19:37.146 --> 19:42.146
And emptiness is a mirror
turned to my own face.

19:43.110 --> 19:48.110
I see myself
and am seized by disgust and fear.

19:54.038 --> 19:59.038
Through my indifference for people,
I've been placed outside of their society.

20:01.211 --> 20:06.211
Now I live in a ghost world,
enclosed in my dreams and imaginings.

20:06.759 --> 20:11.596
- Despite that, you don't want to die.
- Yes, I want to.

20:11.597 --> 20:16.476
- What are you waiting for?
- I want knowledge.

20:16.477 --> 20:21.477
- You want guarantees.
- Call it what you like.

20:25.527 --> 20:30.406
Is it so terribly inconceivable
to comprehend God with one's senses?

20:30.407 --> 20:35.407
Why does He hide in a cloud of
half-promises and unseen miracles?

20:37.831 --> 20:41.751
How can we believe in the faithful
when we lack faith?

20:41.752 --> 20:45.838
What will happen to us
who want to believe, but cannot?

20:45.839 --> 20:49.801
What about those
who neither want to nor can believe?

20:49.802 --> 20:52.386
Why can't I kill God in me?

20:52.387 --> 20:56.224
Why does He live on in me
in an humiliating way

20:56.225 --> 21:00.269
despite my wanting to evict Him
from my heart?

21:00.270 --> 21:05.270
Why is He, despite all,
a mocking reality I can't be rid of?

21:06.276 --> 21:10.655
- Do you hear?
- I hear you.

21:10.656 --> 21:15.656
I want knowledge! Not faith,
not assumptions, but knowledge.

21:16.954 --> 21:21.954
I want God to stretch out His hand,
uncover His face and speak to me.

21:23.127 --> 21:28.127
- But He remains silent.
- I call out to Him in the darkness.

21:28.382 --> 21:33.302
- But it's as if no one was there.
- Perhaps there isn't anyone.

21:33.303 --> 21:36.264
Then life is a preposterous horror.

21:36.265 --> 21:41.265
No man can live faced with Death,
knowing everything's nothingness.

21:41.603 --> 21:44.939
Most people think neither of Death
nor nothingness.

21:44.940 --> 21:49.940
But one day you stand
at the edge of life and face darkness.

21:49.945 --> 21:54.945
- That day.
- I understand what you mean.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.744
We must make an idol of our fear

21:58.745 --> 22:02.456
and that idol we shall call God.

22:02.457 --> 22:05.277
You are worried.

22:05.460 --> 22:10.459
Death came to see me this morning.
We played chess together.

22:11.632 --> 22:15.468
The respite allows me
to attend to some business.

22:15.469 --> 22:17.869
What business?

22:18.097 --> 22:22.851
All my life I've been searching,
wondering,

22:22.852 --> 22:26.146
talking without meaning or context.

22:26.147 --> 22:31.147
It has been nothing. Yes, I say so
without bitterness or self-reproach,

22:32.695 --> 22:37.695
as I know that almost all of people’s
lives are made this way.

22:37.950 --> 22:42.950
But I want to use my respite
for one meaningful act.

22:45.750 --> 22:49.920
That's why you are playing chess with Death.

22:49.921 --> 22:54.921
He's a difficult and skilful tactician,
but so far I have not surrendered a piece.

22:56.510 --> 23:01.014
How can you outwit Death in your game?

23:01.015 --> 23:04.851
I'm playing a combination
of bishop and knight

23:04.852 --> 23:09.852
that he hasn't noticed yet.
I'll expose his flank in the next move.

23:11.859 --> 23:15.249
I'll remember that.

23:19.867 --> 23:24.867
You're a traitor. And you cheated me.

23:26.123 --> 23:31.123
But we'll meet again.
And I'll find a way.

23:31.420 --> 23:36.420
We'll meet at the inn.
We'll continue our game then.

23:42.598 --> 23:47.598
This is my hand. I can move it.

23:47.979 --> 23:51.939
My blood gushes in it.

23:52.358 --> 23:55.777
The sun is still high in the sky.

23:55.778 --> 24:00.488
And I... I, Antonius Block,

24:02.785 --> 24:07.645
am playing chess with Death.

24:08.165 --> 24:11.418
My master and I have been abroad.

24:11.419 --> 24:16.419
Do you understand, my dear... Pictor?

24:16.465 --> 24:19.843
- The crusades.
- Exactly.

24:19.844 --> 24:23.263
For 10 years,
we let snakes bite us,

24:23.264 --> 24:27.434
insects sting us, animals maul us,
heathens slaughter us,

24:27.435 --> 24:32.435
the wine poison us, women infect us,
lice eat us, fever rot us.

24:32.898 --> 24:37.898
- Everything in the name of God.
- In the name of God.

24:39.947 --> 24:44.947
Our crusade was so stupid,
only an idealist could have invented it.

24:51.917 --> 24:56.917
- All this about the plague is awful.
- It's worse than that.

24:58.132 --> 25:02.677
Oh, yes... It's always
your own arse you sit on.

25:02.678 --> 25:07.678
- A great truth.
- Your own arse. Your own arse.

25:09.560 --> 25:14.560
- A profound truth.
- Here is Jöns the squire.

25:14.774 --> 25:19.652
He grins at Death, guffaws at the Lord,
laughs at himself, smiles at the girls.

25:19.653 --> 25:24.032
His world is believable
to no one but himself.

25:24.033 --> 25:27.327
Ridiculous to everyone, even himself.

25:27.328 --> 25:32.328
Meaningless in heaven
and indifferent in hell...

25:57.358 --> 26:00.944
Your stew stinks, what's it for?

26:00.945 --> 26:04.906
She was joined in flesh
with the Evil One.

26:04.907 --> 26:09.411
- And now she's in the stocks.
- She will burn in the morning.

26:09.412 --> 26:14.412
- But we must keep the Devil away.
- With that stinking brew?

26:14.792 --> 26:19.129
The best stuff,
blood and guts of a big black dog.

26:19.130 --> 26:23.967
The... The Evil One
can't bear the smell.

26:23.968 --> 26:25.918
Me neither.

26:35.187 --> 26:38.148
Have you seen the Devil?

26:38.149 --> 26:41.526
- Don't talk to her?
- Is it so dangerous?

26:41.527 --> 26:46.527
I don't know, but she's seen as guilty
of the plague that has befallen us.

27:18.062 --> 27:23.062
Oh, fate is a reprobate
You my friend an unfortunate

27:24.360 --> 27:29.360
Now you bound in haste
Now worms lay you to waste

27:31.326 --> 27:35.016
- Must you sing?
- No.

29:39.412 --> 29:43.624
Why do you look so surprised?
I steal from the dead.

29:43.625 --> 29:48.625
It's quite a rewarding domain
these days.

29:49.589 --> 29:54.217
You're thinking of telling tales
in the village? It won't help.

29:54.218 --> 29:59.218
Each one of us saves his own skin.
It's that simple.

30:00.725 --> 30:05.270
Don't try to scream. No one
will hear you, neither God nor man.

30:05.271 --> 30:10.271
It's nothing to be surprised about.

30:13.696 --> 30:17.282
I recognize you,
even though it was long ago.

30:17.283 --> 30:21.036
You're Raval
from the seminary in Roskilde.

30:21.037 --> 30:26.037
Doctor Mirabilis, Caelestis et Diabilis.
Am I not right?

30:28.294 --> 30:33.294
You convinced my master to go to the
Holy Land on an honorable crusade.

30:37.387 --> 30:42.387
Are you worried?
Butterflies in your belly?

30:42.558 --> 30:47.558
Now I understand the meaning of
these 10 years that I thought wasted.

30:47.647 --> 30:50.816
We had it too good,
we were too content.

30:50.817 --> 30:54.653
The Lord wanted to punish
our self-satisfied pride.

30:54.654 --> 30:59.654
He sent you to spit your heavenly
venom and to poison the knight.

31:00.034 --> 31:04.162
- It was in good faith.
- But now you know better, don't you?

31:04.163 --> 31:09.163
Now you're a thief, a more suitable
occupation for wretches and villains.

31:11.462 --> 31:14.252
Am I not right?

31:17.343 --> 31:20.721
By all means. I am not bloodthirsty.

31:20.722 --> 31:25.722
Next time I'll mark your face like we do
with petty villains of your kind.

31:27.979 --> 31:32.979
I actually came
to fill my water bag.

31:39.532 --> 31:44.160
Jöns is the name.
I'm a nice, talkative young man

31:44.161 --> 31:49.161
who only thinks good thoughts
and commits honorable deeds.

31:55.672 --> 32:00.134
Farewell, my girl.
I could have raped you.

32:00.135 --> 32:05.135
But between us, I'm tired of that
kind of love. It's dry in the long run.

32:09.227 --> 32:14.227
When I think of it, I need
a housekeeper. Do you cook well?

32:14.941 --> 32:19.653
I'm married, but I have hope
my wife will be dead by now.

32:19.654 --> 32:23.914
So I need a housekeeper!

32:24.826 --> 32:29.826
Come now and don't just stand there.
I saved you from death so you owe me!

32:46.181 --> 32:48.281
Bloody hams!

32:49.893 --> 32:54.893
Making a spectacle of themselves.

34:10.806 --> 34:15.217
Stop that, you tin-heads!

34:15.437 --> 34:20.274
I don't start
so I'll go behind the drape.

34:20.275 --> 34:23.860
Stop staring, you blockheads!

34:23.862 --> 34:28.862
The horse sits in the tree and crows

34:30.911 --> 34:35.911
The road is wide but the door is low
The Black One dances on the beach

34:40.837 --> 34:45.837
The hen meows in the darkest lake

34:51.348 --> 34:56.348
The day is red but the fish is dead

34:56.478 --> 35:01.478
The Black One squats on the beach

35:03.944 --> 35:08.944
The snake flutters in heaven's heights

35:10.700 --> 35:14.286
The virgin is pale
but the pussy shows delight

35:14.287 --> 35:19.287
The Black One runs on the beach

35:20.669 --> 35:25.669
The ram hisses with teeth apart

35:31.972 --> 35:36.972
The gust is harsh and the waves dart

35:37.978 --> 35:42.978
The Black One farts on the beach

35:45.318 --> 35:50.318
The horse sits in the tree and crows

35:52.283 --> 35:55.786
The road is wide but the door is low

35:55.787 --> 36:00.787
The Black One dances on the beach

36:02.252 --> 36:07.252
The hen meows in the darkest lake

36:12.762 --> 36:17.762
The day is red but the fish is dead

36:17.851 --> 36:22.851
The Black One squats on the beach

36:25.358 --> 36:30.357
The snake flutters in heaven's heights

36:32.031 --> 36:35.700
The virgin is pale
but the pussy shows delight

36:35.701 --> 36:40.701
The Black One runs on the beach

36:41.707 --> 36:46.707
The sow lays and the cat sows

36:48.797 --> 36:52.592
Night is blighted and darkness glows

36:52.593 --> 36:55.970
The Black One remains, remains

36:55.971 --> 37:00.971
Remains, remains on the beach

39:20.365 --> 39:24.368
God has sent
His punishment over us.

39:24.369 --> 39:28.629
Yes! You will all vanish

39:29.291 --> 39:32.681
by the Black Death.

39:33.337 --> 39:37.882
You standing there
like open-mouthed cattle.

39:37.883 --> 39:42.261
And you sitting there
in bloated self-satisfaction.

39:42.262 --> 39:47.262
Do you know
that this could be your final hour?

39:49.269 --> 39:53.409
Death stands behind you.

39:53.690 --> 39:57.526
I can see the crown of his head
gleam in the sun.

39:57.527 --> 40:02.073
His scythe flashes when he raises it
behind your heads.

40:02.074 --> 40:07.074
Who among you will he strike first?

40:07.287 --> 40:10.623
You there, staring like a goat.

40:10.624 --> 40:15.624
Before evening will your mouth be
distorted into a last, unfinished yawn?

40:18.298 --> 40:23.298
And you, woman, blooming
with appetite and lust for life.

40:25.472 --> 40:30.472
Will you grow pale
and drop before the dawn?

40:31.937 --> 40:36.937
And you there,
with your swollen nose and silly grin.

40:38.318 --> 40:43.318
Have you got a year left to pollute
the earth with your debris?

40:44.408 --> 40:49.408
Do you know, you confirmed idiots,
that you are all going to die?

40:50.038 --> 40:54.208
Today, tomorrow, or the next day.
You are all condemned.

40:54.209 --> 40:59.209
Do you hear what I say? Do you hear
the word? Condemned, condemned!

41:01.133 --> 41:05.136
Lord, take pity on us
in our degradation.

41:05.137 --> 41:08.389
Don't turn Your face
from us in contempt

41:08.390 --> 41:13.390
but have mercy on us for the sake
of Your Son, Jesus Christ!

42:17.666 --> 42:22.666
This bloody talk of doom. Is that
sustenance for a modern man?

42:23.089 --> 42:28.089
Do they really think we'll take them
seriously? You laugh at me, Sire.

42:28.677 --> 42:33.677
I've read, heard and experienced
most stories we tell one another.

42:36.435 --> 42:40.605
Even the ghost story of God,
Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit,

42:40.606 --> 42:45.606
I've absorbed
without much emotion.

42:46.153 --> 42:50.365
- Why are you shouting?
- I'm Plog and you're Jöns.

42:50.366 --> 42:53.535
- That's possible.
- Have you seen my wife?

42:53.536 --> 42:58.536
No, I haven't. But if I had, and she
resembled you, I'd be quick to forget.

43:02.086 --> 43:06.423
- So, you haven't seen her?
- Maybe she's run away.

43:06.424 --> 43:10.009
- Do you know anything?
- Quite a lot, but not of your wife.

43:10.010 --> 43:15.010
Go to the tavern
and you may find an answer.

43:33.200 --> 43:38.200
It's true, the plague has swamped
the west coast. People die like flies.

43:38.914 --> 43:43.914
Business is normally good at this
time of year, but my stock's unsold.

43:45.004 --> 43:50.004
They talk of the Last Day. And all
the omens certainly are terrible.

43:52.470 --> 43:55.805
A woman gave birth to a calf’s head.

43:55.806 --> 44:00.101
People are crazy. They flee inland
and take the plague with them.

44:00.102 --> 44:05.102
If it's as they say, then we'll have
to enjoy life as long as we're standing.

44:06.400 --> 44:10.695
Many people have cleaned
themselves by fire and died.

44:10.696 --> 44:15.696
But the priest says it is better
to die clean than to live for hell.

44:16.285 --> 44:21.285
This is the end, that's what it is. We
all know it, but no one dares to say it.

44:22.541 --> 44:26.753
This is the end.
People are crazy with fear.

44:26.754 --> 44:31.466
- And you're scared too?
- Too right I'm scared!

44:31.467 --> 44:34.844
Judgment Day
edges toward evening.

44:34.845 --> 44:39.845
The angels descend and the graves
open. It will be terrible to see.

44:45.314 --> 44:49.192
- I'll sell you this bracelet cheaply.
- I can't afford it.

44:49.193 --> 44:53.821
- It's genuine silver.
- It's nice, but probably too expensive.

44:53.822 --> 44:58.493
- Have you gentlemen seen my wife?
- Is she lost?

44:58.494 --> 45:02.372
She's run away, they say.
With an actor.

45:02.373 --> 45:06.125
An actor?
If she has such bad taste, let her go.

45:06.126 --> 45:11.126
You are absolutely right.
I was thinking I would kill her.

45:11.257 --> 45:16.257
- I see. Murder is another thing.
- I'm going to kill the actor, too.

45:16.845 --> 45:20.598
- The actor?
- The one she's run off with.

45:20.599 --> 45:24.769
- What for?
- Are you thick?

45:24.770 --> 45:29.770
Oh, the actor! Now I understand.
There are far too many of them.

45:30.109 --> 45:34.988
Even if he's blameless,
you should kill him.

45:34.989 --> 45:39.989
- Are you telling tales to him?
- Me? Am I telling tales?

45:45.040 --> 45:50.040
You're also an actor and it's your
crony that's snuck off with his wife.

45:50.504 --> 45:53.798
Are you an actor as well?

45:53.799 --> 45:57.719
Me, an actor? Not really.

45:57.720 --> 46:02.014
Then we should kill you. It's logical.

46:02.015 --> 46:05.851
- You're funny.
- You've gone pale.

46:05.852 --> 46:10.852
- Something on your conscience?
- You're funny. Don't you think so?

46:13.401 --> 46:18.401
Maybe we should mark you as one
does with petty villains of your kind.

46:19.866 --> 46:24.866
What have you done to my wife?

46:36.341 --> 46:40.177
Do you want to hurt me?
Why?

46:40.178 --> 46:45.178
Have I annoyed anyone or been in the
way? I'll leave and never come back.

46:47.060 --> 46:52.060
Stand up so everyone can hear you.

46:53.316 --> 46:55.566
Speak louder.

46:56.486 --> 47:01.486
Stand on your head so we can see
whether you're a good actor.

47:11.876 --> 47:16.876
What have you done to my wife?

47:16.964 --> 47:21.051
- Don't whimper. Get up and dance.
- I can't. I won't.

47:21.052 --> 47:23.887
- Imitate a bear.
- I can't imitate a bear.

47:23.888 --> 47:28.888
We'll see if you can anyway.

48:25.324 --> 48:30.324
- Get up. Be a good bear.
- I can't be a bear anymore.

48:47.722 --> 48:52.722
Remember what I'd do to you
if we met again?

48:53.311 --> 48:57.361
I'm a man of my word.

49:19.796 --> 49:23.548
- What's his name?
- Mikael.

49:23.549 --> 49:27.969
- How old is he?
- He's just over one year.

49:27.970 --> 49:32.970
- He's big for his age.
- You think so? Yes, he is quite big.

49:33.601 --> 49:38.601
- You were in a performance today.
- Did you think it was bad?

49:38.689 --> 49:43.485
You're more beautiful without make-up.
That dress suits you better.

49:43.486 --> 49:48.486
You think so? Jonas Skat went
and left us, so now we're in a real fix.

49:49.700 --> 49:53.829
- Is that your husband?
- Jonas? No.

49:53.830 --> 49:58.208
- The other man is. His name is Jof.
- Oh, him.

49:58.209 --> 50:03.209
Now it's only me and him. We'll have
to do tricks again, and that's a bother.

50:03.923 --> 50:08.844
- Do you do tricks as well?
- Oh, yes. And Jof is a good juggler.

50:08.845 --> 50:12.973
- Will Mikael also be an acrobat?
- Jof wants him to be.

50:12.974 --> 50:16.226
- But not you?
- I don't know.

50:16.227 --> 50:20.438
- Maybe he'll be a knight.
- It's not so much fun, I can tell you.

50:20.439 --> 50:23.692
- You don't look happy.
- No.

50:23.693 --> 50:28.693
- Are you tired? Why?
- I have boring company.

50:29.156 --> 50:32.659
- Do you mean your squire?
- No, not him.

50:32.660 --> 50:36.830
- Who do you mean, then?
- Myself.

50:36.831 --> 50:40.750
- Oh, I understand.
- Do you really?

50:40.751 --> 50:43.837
Yes, I understand quite well.

50:43.838 --> 50:48.837
I often wonder why people torment
themselves as soon as they can.

50:49.509 --> 50:54.509
- Mia...
- Jof... Jof, what is it?

50:55.599 --> 51:00.599
Jof! Jof, what have you done?
Have you... Come and sit down.

51:01.897 --> 51:06.897
Where have you been?
Let me look at you.

51:11.406 --> 51:16.406
Why did you have to go to the tavern?
You drank, of course.

51:17.120 --> 51:22.120
- I didn't drink a drop.
- You boasted about angels and devils.

51:22.959 --> 51:27.959
- People don't like too many ideas.
- I didn't mention angels.

51:28.048 --> 51:32.593
Then you sang and danced.
You always have to perform.

51:32.594 --> 51:36.472
- People get angry at that, too.
- Look at what...

51:36.473 --> 51:41.473
Look at what I bought for you.

51:44.439 --> 51:49.439
- You couldn’t afford that.
- Well, I did it anyway.

51:49.527 --> 51:50.327
Jof!

51:52.364 --> 51:57.364
- Oh, they gave me such a beating.
- Why didn't you give one back?

51:57.410 --> 52:01.956
I just got scared and angry,
but never got that far.

52:01.957 --> 52:06.919
I got angry, believe me.
I roared like a lion.

52:06.920 --> 52:11.920
- Did they get scared?
- No, they just laughed.

52:15.387 --> 52:17.937
Mikael. Mikael.

52:27.023 --> 52:29.817
- Smell how good he smells.
- And he's solid.

52:29.818 --> 52:34.818
You're a solid one, you are.
A real acrobat's body.

52:34.823 --> 52:39.083
This is my husband, Jof.

52:40.245 --> 52:42.830
- Good day.
- Good day.

52:42.831 --> 52:46.458
You have a fine son.
He will bring you joy.

52:46.459 --> 52:51.213
Yes, he is lovely.
Do we have anything to offer, Mia?

52:51.214 --> 52:55.134
- Thanks, I shan't have anything.
- I picked wild strawberries.

52:55.135 --> 52:59.638
- And we actually milked some milk.
- Have milked...

52:59.639 --> 53:03.475
If the knight would join us
it would be an honor.

53:03.476 --> 53:08.476
- Sit down and I'll bring the food.
- Please.

53:08.857 --> 53:12.151
- Where are you heading?
- To Elsinore.

53:12.152 --> 53:16.363
- I'd advise against a trip like that.
- Why, if I may ask?

53:16.364 --> 53:21.364
The plague is going down the coast.
People are dying in their ten thousands.

53:21.536 --> 53:26.536
- Trouble always brings his brother.
- Follow me through the woods.

53:27.417 --> 53:32.417
You can stay at my estate or follow
the east coast. You'll be safer.

53:32.547 --> 53:32.963
They're wood strawberries.
They grow on the hill.

53:32.964 --> 53:35.799
They're wood strawberries.
They grow on the hill.

53:35.800 --> 53:40.800
I never seen them so big.
Smell how fragrant they are.

53:42.182 --> 53:46.727
- Enjoy the fare.
- I thank you respectfully.

53:46.728 --> 53:50.647
I think your suggestion is good,
but I must consider first.

53:50.648 --> 53:53.776
It would be nice to have company
through the wood.

53:53.777 --> 53:58.280
It's full of ghosts, devils and thieves.
So I heard.

53:58.281 --> 54:01.950
I said it wasn't bad,
but I must consider it.

54:01.951 --> 54:05.662
Since Skat left,
I'm responsible for the troupe.

54:05.663 --> 54:10.663
- I've become the manager, after all.
- "I've become the manager, after all."

54:16.800 --> 54:20.552
- Would you like strawberries?
- That man saved my life.

54:20.553 --> 54:25.553
- Sit down and join us.
- The knight's Jöns conveys his thanks.

54:27.936 --> 54:31.313
- Oh, it's so nice.
- For a short while.

54:31.314 --> 54:36.151
Almost always.
One day is much like the next.

54:36.152 --> 54:40.531
Not so strange.
Summer is better than winter,

54:40.532 --> 54:45.452
because you don't freeze.
But spring is the very best.

54:45.453 --> 54:49.039
I wrote a poem about spring.
I'll fetch my lute.

54:49.040 --> 54:53.460
Not now, Jof. Our guests might
not be entertained by your verses.

54:53.461 --> 54:56.713
- Please. I write songs myself.
- There you are.

54:56.714 --> 55:01.714
I have one about an unchaste fish
you may not have heard.

55:02.428 --> 55:04.304
You won't hear it, either.

55:04.305 --> 55:09.305
Some people don't appreciate my art
and I don't wish to torment anyone.

55:13.565 --> 55:18.152
- One worries so much.
- It's better when you are a couple.

55:18.153 --> 55:21.029
- Don't you have anyone?
- Yes.

55:21.030 --> 55:24.324
- What is she doing now?
- I don't know.

55:24.325 --> 55:28.245
You look so solemn.
Was she your sweetheart?

55:28.246 --> 55:33.246
We were newlyweds,
played together, laughed quite a lot.

55:33.626 --> 55:38.625
I wrote songs to her eyes, her nose,
her exquisite, small ears.

55:40.257 --> 55:45.257
We went on hunts. In the evening
we danced. The house was full of life.

55:45.888 --> 55:49.640
Would you like some strawberries?

55:49.641 --> 55:52.727
Faith is a heavy burden,
do you know that?

55:52.728 --> 55:57.728
It's like loving someone in the dark who
never comes, no matter how you call.

56:00.986 --> 56:05.986
But all of that seems unreal when
I sit here with you and your husband.

56:07.242 --> 56:11.162
It's suddenly insignificant.

56:11.163 --> 56:15.333
Now you don't look so solemn.

56:15.334 --> 56:20.334
I will remember this moment.
The stillness and the dusk.

56:21.089 --> 56:26.089
The bowl of wild strawberries,
of milk.

56:26.303 --> 56:29.764
Your faces in the evening light.

56:29.765 --> 56:34.765
Mikael lying asleep,
Jof with his lute.

56:34.937 --> 56:38.940
I will try and remember
what we spoke of.

56:38.941 --> 56:42.985
And I will carry this memory
between my hands,

56:42.986 --> 56:47.986
as carefully as if it were a bowl
brimming with freshly milked milk.

56:53.622 --> 56:58.622
And this will be a sign for me,
and greatly fulfilling.

57:34.079 --> 57:37.619
I have been waiting.

57:37.874 --> 57:41.168
Excuse me, I was somewhat delayed.

57:41.169 --> 57:45.172
As I've given away my strategy,
I will retreat.

57:45.173 --> 57:48.801
Go ahead. It's your move.

57:48.802 --> 57:52.638
- Why do you look so pleased?
- That's my secret.

57:52.639 --> 57:57.226
Naturally. I will take your knight now.

57:57.227 --> 58:00.467
You were right to.

58:00.897 --> 58:05.651
- Have you tricked me?
- Of course, you fell into the trap.

58:05.652 --> 58:08.946
I put you in check.

58:08.947 --> 58:13.947
- What are you laughing at?
- No matter. Save your king instead.

58:14.244 --> 58:19.244
- You are quite arrogant.
- Our game amuses me.

58:19.833 --> 58:23.210
It's your move.
Be quick, I'm in a hurry.

58:23.211 --> 58:28.211
I know you are busy, but you won't
avoid our game. It will take its time.

58:29.509 --> 58:33.429
You're travelling with the jesters
through the woods?

58:33.430 --> 58:38.430
The two called Jof and Mia,
who have a little son?

58:41.104 --> 58:43.894
Why do you ask?

58:44.775 --> 58:46.575
No reason.

58:55.952 --> 58:56.160
- Have you seen Jöns? We must go.
- I believe he's in the inn.

58:56.161 --> 59:01.161
- Have you seen Jöns? We must go.
- I believe he's in the inn.

59:04.586 --> 59:08.798
Good heavens.
If it isn't Plog the blacksmith.

59:08.799 --> 59:11.759
- Evening.
- Are you sniveling all alone?

59:11.760 --> 59:16.760
Yes, the blacksmith’s sobbing
and wailing like a soaked rabbit.

59:17.391 --> 59:20.434
- Still the wife?
- Yes, I haven't found her.

59:20.435 --> 59:23.813
Yes, it's hell with women
and hell without them.

59:23.814 --> 59:27.316
Logical to kill them
when it's at its best.

59:27.317 --> 59:31.862
- Henpecking and swills.
- Screaming babies and wet nappies.

59:31.863 --> 59:36.863
- Sharp nails and malice.
- The Devil’s aunt as mother-in-law.

59:36.993 --> 59:41.288
- Then when you're going to sleep...
- Another tune.

59:41.289 --> 59:45.292
Tears, complaints
and laments by the sackfull.

59:45.293 --> 59:49.004
- "Why don't you kiss me?"
- "Why don't you sing?"

59:49.005 --> 59:53.843
- "Why don't you love me like before?"
- "Why don't you eye my new shift?"

59:53.844 --> 59:57.555
- "You just turn your back and snore."
- Oh, hell...

59:57.556 --> 01:00:02.556
Oh, hell... She's gone now! Be happy!

01:00:04.729 --> 01:00:08.315
I'm going to pinch them
in the nose with my pliers.

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:12.403
I'm going to pound them on the chest
with the little hammer.

01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:17.404
I'm going to crack them lightly
on the head with the sledgehammer.

01:00:17.784 --> 01:00:21.870
Look, he's blubbering again!

01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:25.832
- Maybe I love her.
- Maybe you love her?

01:00:25.833 --> 01:00:30.378
Listen, you moron,
love is another word for lust,

01:00:30.379 --> 01:00:35.379
plus lust, plus lust, plus a lot of
deception, falsehoods and trickery.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:41.260
- But it hurts anyway.
- Love is the blackest of all plagues.

01:00:42.433 --> 01:00:47.020
If you died from it there'd be some joy.
But it almost always passes.

01:00:47.021 --> 01:00:51.774
- No, mine won't pass.
- Oh, yes, yours too!

01:00:51.775 --> 01:00:56.488
There are only a few poor dullards
now and then who die of love.

01:00:56.489 --> 01:01:01.489
If all is imperfect in this imperfect
world, then love is most imperfect

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:05.830
in its perfect imperfection.

01:01:05.831 --> 01:01:10.831
You're lucky to have such a fluid tongue
that you believe your own twaddle.

01:01:12.087 --> 01:01:15.882
Believe? Who said I did?
But I love giving good advice.

01:01:15.883 --> 01:01:20.470
Ask for one and you get two.
So I'm actually a learned chap.

01:01:20.471 --> 01:01:24.474
Jöns!
Can I follow you through the woods?

01:01:24.475 --> 01:01:29.475
I'm so lonely and don't want
to go home as they all laugh at me.

01:01:30.773 --> 01:01:34.651
As long as you don't sob all the time
or we'll leave you.

01:01:34.652 --> 01:01:35.732
Jöns!

01:01:46.705 --> 01:01:50.625
- My little brother...
- Watch out, Jöns!

01:01:50.626 --> 01:01:53.962
- He just wants to fight.
- He's sobbing now.

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:58.963
I'm really sorry if I harmed you,
but I have such a temper.

01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:02.422
Take my hand.

01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:09.435
- Let me embrace you, little brother.
- A little later, maybe.

01:02:09.436 --> 01:02:14.436
We're actually in a hurry. Thanks.

01:03:03.699 --> 01:03:08.699
Ah, what do I see? Who is it looms
out of the edge of the forest

01:03:10.372 --> 01:03:15.372
if not My Most Treasured
with attached actor!

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.316
Watch out!

01:03:38.317 --> 01:03:43.317
You must be the dirty blacksmith
that humiliated my beloved Kunigunda.

01:03:45.282 --> 01:03:50.282
- What did you say her name was?
- Kunigunda. Are you deaf?

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:55.500
Her name's Lisa.
Lisa Daft or Sloven or Tart.

01:03:55.501 --> 01:04:00.254
- Drawerless Hussy or Arse Lisa.
- Goodness, he's base!

01:04:00.255 --> 01:04:05.255
Just good at sleaze, not unlike
yourself, you gilded bawd-pudding.

01:04:05.719 --> 01:04:09.097
- Oh, he's base!
- You awful, cropped bastard

01:04:09.098 --> 01:04:12.892
of seven mangy mongrels,
if I were in your infested rags,

01:04:12.893 --> 01:04:16.771
I'd be afflicted
by such boundless shame

01:04:16.772 --> 01:04:21.651
that I'd free nature from
my embarrassing countenance.

01:04:21.652 --> 01:04:26.652
- Watch out, you perfumed...
- "Powder-puff."

01:04:27.157 --> 01:04:31.411
...powder-puff,
that I don't let off a fart

01:04:31.412 --> 01:04:36.412
that will assign you
to the juggler’s inferno in a flash,

01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:39.961
- where you can sit together and...
- "Read soliloquies."

01:04:39.962 --> 01:04:44.962
...read soliloquies to one another
until dust forms in the Devil’s ears.

01:04:45.926 --> 01:04:50.926
Careful I don't poke your belly
so your intestines flow out your ears.

01:04:51.724 --> 01:04:56.724
Careful I don't smack you so you can't
even play for Turks and cannibals.

01:04:59.106 --> 01:05:02.024
What are you laughing at?
This is serious.

01:05:02.025 --> 01:05:06.529
In southern lands there is a man-like
animal called an ape.

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:09.030
- What of it?
- Just that.

01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:13.891
- Plog, my only Plog.
- What?

01:05:14.454 --> 01:05:18.457
- What?
- Darling Plog, forgive me everything.

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:23.458
- She'll start crying in a minute.
- I have to cry. It's awful.

01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:28.341
That man deceived me so badly,
you won't believe.

01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:33.342
- Kunigunda, if we're going to tell the truth...
- And now for his favorite dishes.

01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:38.643
Plog, when we get home
I'll make dumplings for you

01:05:38.644 --> 01:05:43.315
with mashed turnips and lingonberries,
which is your favorite.

01:05:43.316 --> 01:05:48.316
- Isn't that so, Plog?
- Yes, but I have to kill him first.

01:05:49.155 --> 01:05:53.074
Yes, kill him.
Kill him really properly.

01:05:53.075 --> 01:05:58.075
- I don't like him at all anymore.
- God, why did you give us woman?

01:05:58.915 --> 01:06:02.501
You know what he is?
Just a false beard, false teeth,

01:06:02.502 --> 01:06:06.463
false smiles, rehearsed intonation
and empty as a jar.

01:06:06.464 --> 01:06:11.259
- Go ahead and kill him.
- My dear Plog...

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.639
If you thought I'd defend
my so-called reality you're mistaken.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.640
- Kill me. I'll thank you. Afterwards.
- What are you saying?

01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:24.523
He's created confusion.
Already a half-victory.

01:06:24.524 --> 01:06:29.524
- Do something, don't just stand there!
- He has to fight or I can't kill him.

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:33.532
He has to provoke me
so I get angry like before.

01:06:33.533 --> 01:06:38.078
Dear friend,
I lower this dagger to my breast.

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:42.874
And my reality will quickly transform
into a new, solid reality.

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:45.544
The absolute manifestation
of the corpse.

01:06:45.545 --> 01:06:49.756
Wait... I didn't mean it like that.

01:06:49.757 --> 01:06:54.757
I forgive you, Kunigunda. Farewell,
my friend, pray for me sometime.

01:07:12.154 --> 01:07:15.198
Oh, dear... Oh, dear...

01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:19.452
I didn't mean it like that.
I started to really like him.

01:07:19.453 --> 01:07:24.453
He's absolutely dead. I've almost
never seen such a dead actor.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:29.087
It's really sad, although he
wanted it himself, poor thing.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:34.088
- And I'm married to her...
- Well, you got your little Lisa back.

01:07:35.511 --> 01:07:40.511
- Aren't you happy?
- Jöns, in the strictest confidence...

01:07:40.933 --> 01:07:45.933
- Isn't life quite...
- Yes, it is. But don't think about it.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:53.065
It's mad, that's what it is.

01:07:59.035 --> 01:08:04.035
That was a good performance.
I'm nothing if not a good actor.

01:08:07.376 --> 01:08:11.713
I'll find a tree and climb it.

01:08:11.714 --> 01:08:16.714
So no bears, wolves or ghosts
can get hold of me.

01:08:35.529 --> 01:08:40.529
I'll find Jof and Mia tomorrow, then
we'll go to the All Saints Festival.

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:45.162
I'll sing a song to myself.

01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:50.163
I'm a little bird who sings how I want

01:08:51.671 --> 01:08:56.671
Craftsmen in the forest. How nice.

01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:03.848
By God, it's my tree
they're sawing down!

01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:08.728
Hey, you dozy cockerel!
What are you doing to my tree?

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:13.729
Can't you answer?
Courtesy is cheap. Who are you?

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:18.404
I'm sawing down your tree
as your time is up.

01:09:18.406 --> 01:09:23.406
- It's not possible. I don't have time.
- Haven't you got time?

01:09:23.995 --> 01:09:28.995
- I've got a performance.
- It's cancelled. Because of a death.

01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:33.879
- My contract!
- Annulled.

01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:38.921
- My family and my children...
- Shame on you, Skat!

01:09:39.135 --> 01:09:42.720
I am ashamed, I'm ashamed...

01:09:42.721 --> 01:09:47.721
Aren't there any acquittals?
Any special rules for actors?

01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:51.688
No, not in this case.

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:56.428
No loopholes, no exceptions?

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:44.031
The moon just came out
from behind the clouds.

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:47.534
Good. We'll see the road better.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:52.535
- I don't like the moon tonight.
- The trees are so still.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:57.707
- That's because there isn't any wind.
- He means they are very still.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:03.258
It's completely quiet.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:07.012
- If we at least heard a fox.
- Or an owl.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:12.013
Or a human voice.
Beside one's own.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.507
- Where are you going?
- To the stake.

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:48.262
I see, it's the witch. Why burn her
in the middle of the night?

01:11:48.263 --> 01:11:53.225
- People lack amusement nowadays.
- Quiet, by all the dev... Saints.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:58.226
- She has the Devil with her.
- Then you men are eight brave men.

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:03.356
Well, we're paid.
The task was voluntary.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:43.874
Do you hear me?

01:13:44.796 --> 01:13:49.549
- They say you worked with the Devil.
- Why do you ask that?

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:54.550
Not out of curiosity,
but for highly personal reasons.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:59.931
- I also want to meet him.
- Why?

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:03.522
I want to ask him about God.

01:14:03.523 --> 01:14:08.353
He must know. He if anyone.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:13.323
- You can see him when you want.
- How?

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:18.203
But then you must do as I say.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:21.444
Look into my eyes.

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:27.421
Well? What do you see?
Do you see him?

01:14:27.422 --> 01:14:32.422
I see a rigid fear in your eyes.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.219
Nothing else.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:41.039
No one, nothing... No one...

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.235
No.

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:49.771
Isn't he standing
behind your back either?

01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:54.478
No. There's nothing here.

01:14:57.117 --> 01:15:02.117
But he's with me everywhere. I only
need to put out my hand and I feel his.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:07.710
He is with me now as well.
The fire won't hurt me.

01:15:07.711 --> 01:15:10.880
- Has he said so?
- I know.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:15.881
I know, I know. You must see
him somewhere, you must!

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:20.348
The priest had no trouble seeing him,
nor the troops.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:25.349
They're so scared of him
they don't even dare to touch me.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.735
- Why have you crushed her hands?
- It's not us.

01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:37.736
- Who?
- Ask the monk over there.

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:43.325
What have you done to the girl?

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:49.210
Do you never cease asking?

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:52.451
No. I never cease.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:58.799
But you don't get any answer.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:18.402
I thought about killing the guard,
but it doesn't help. She's almost dead.

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:23.573
I told you to watch out!
Don't go near to her.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:37.963
Eat this and the pain will go.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:41.322
- What's she see? Can you answer?
- She's not in pain anymore.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:45.910
You're not answering my question.
Who will take care of that child?

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:50.911
Is it the angels or God or Satan
or just emptiness?

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:54.502
- Emptiness, Sire.
- It can't be so!

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:59.503
Look at her eyes. Her poor
consciousness is perceiving something.

01:17:59.799 --> 01:18:03.636
- Emptiness under the moon.
- No.

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:08.224
We stand powerless with hanging
arms, as we see what she sees.

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:11.435
Our fear and hers are the same.

01:18:11.436 --> 01:18:16.436
That little child... I can't be
bothered, I can't be bothered...

01:19:31.223 --> 01:19:36.185
He sings so beautifully of Jesus Christ

01:19:36.186 --> 01:19:41.166
There is great joy in heaven

01:19:42.693 --> 01:19:47.693
The dawn will break soon.
Yet the heat hangs like a damp blanket.

01:19:48.949 --> 01:19:51.589
I'm so scared.

01:19:52.036 --> 01:19:57.036
We feel something is going to happen
to us, but we don't know what it is.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:20:02.625
- Maybe the final day.
- The final day.

01:20:10.721 --> 01:20:15.721
Haven't you got any water?
Can you give me some water?

01:20:17.811 --> 01:20:22.811
- I've got the plague.
- Keep to the other side of the stump!

01:20:27.988 --> 01:20:32.988
I'm scared of dying.
I don't want to die, I don't want to!

01:20:38.999 --> 01:20:43.999
Can't you take pity on me? Help me...

01:20:44.004 --> 01:20:47.664
At least talk to me!

01:20:52.388 --> 01:20:57.183
It doesn't help. It doesn't help.

01:20:57.184 --> 01:21:02.184
I know it doesn't help at all.

01:21:03.524 --> 01:21:08.524
I'm going to die. I... I...

01:21:11.323 --> 01:21:16.323
What's going to happen to me?
Can't you even comfort me?

01:21:17.037 --> 01:21:22.037
Haven't you got any mercy?
Can't you see that I...

01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:27.588
Is there no help?
Can't I have any water?

01:21:27.589 --> 01:21:32.589
It's meaningless.
It's completely meaningless.

01:21:32.594 --> 01:21:35.847
I said, it's meaningless.

01:21:35.848 --> 01:21:40.848
- Help me!
- Can't you hear I'm comforting you?

01:22:06.378 --> 01:22:11.378
- Shall we conclude our game?
- It's your move.

01:22:19.558 --> 01:22:24.558
- I took your queen.
- I didn't see that.

01:22:37.075 --> 01:22:42.075
Mia... I see something terrible,
something almost unspeakable.

01:22:43.123 --> 01:22:46.876
- What do you see?
- The knight is playing chess.

01:22:46.877 --> 01:22:51.506
- I see that too. It's not so terrible.
- You see who he's playing with?

01:22:51.507 --> 01:22:56.507
- He's alone. Don't scare me like that.
- No, no. He's not alone.

01:22:57.179 --> 01:23:02.179
- Who is it?
- Death. He's playing Death himself.

01:23:03.018 --> 01:23:07.396
- Don't say that.
- We must try and get away.

01:23:07.397 --> 01:23:09.565
- We can't.
- We must try.

01:23:09.566 --> 01:23:14.566
They're so engrossed in their game,
if we leave quietly they won't notice.

01:23:19.743 --> 01:23:24.743
It's your move, Antonius Block.

01:23:26.625 --> 01:23:31.625
- Have you lost interest in our game?
- Lost interest? On the contrary.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:39.800
You look anxious.
Are you concealing something?

01:23:40.305 --> 01:23:45.305
- Nothing escapes you. Isn't that so?
- Nothing escapes me.

01:23:45.727 --> 01:23:50.727
- No one escapes me.
- It is true I'm anxious.

01:23:52.526 --> 01:23:55.196
You are scared.

01:24:02.619 --> 01:24:07.206
I forget where the pieces were.

01:24:07.207 --> 01:24:10.751
But I haven't forgotten.

01:24:10.752 --> 01:24:15.751
You won't get away that easily.

01:24:22.513 --> 01:24:27.513
- I see something interesting now.
- What do you see?

01:24:27.518 --> 01:24:32.518
You will be checkmate
in the next move.

01:24:33.691 --> 01:24:35.911
That's true.

01:24:37.111 --> 01:24:42.111
- Did you profit from your respite?
- Yes, I did.

01:24:42.283 --> 01:24:47.283
That pleases me. I will leave you now.

01:24:48.205 --> 01:24:53.205
When we meet again you and your
entourage's time will be over.

01:24:56.547 --> 01:25:01.547
- And you'll reveal your secrets?
- I carry no secrets.

01:25:02.178 --> 01:25:05.718
So you know nothing?

01:25:05.806 --> 01:25:08.476
I am unknowing.

01:25:30.623 --> 01:25:35.623
- Do you see that strange light?
- It's the storm coming with the dawn.

01:25:36.462 --> 01:25:40.840
It's something else, something
terrible. You hear the rumbling?

01:25:40.841 --> 01:25:45.512
- It's probably the rain.
- No, it's not the rain.

01:25:45.513 --> 01:25:50.513
He's seen us, followed us,
he's caught up to us, he's coming at us!

01:26:03.823 --> 01:26:08.823
Get in the wagon, Mia.
Let's get in, quickly!

01:26:12.456 --> 01:26:16.668
It's the angel of death passing by,
Mia. The angel of death.

01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:21.669
- And he's very big...
- Do you feel how cold it is?

01:28:24.713 --> 01:28:29.713
I heard from returning crusaders
that you were on your way home.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.760
I've waited for you.
All the others have fled the plague.

01:28:40.771 --> 01:28:45.771
Don't you recognize me anymore?

01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:51.610
You've also changed.

01:28:57.705 --> 01:29:01.582
Now I can see it's you.

01:29:01.583 --> 01:29:05.502
Somewhere in your eyes...

01:29:05.503 --> 01:29:10.503
Somewhere in your face,
but hidden and frightened,

01:29:12.343 --> 01:29:17.343
is that boy that set off
all those years ago.

01:29:18.474 --> 01:29:23.474
It's over now and I'm a little tired.

01:29:23.605 --> 01:29:27.941
- Do you regret your journey?
- No.

01:29:27.942 --> 01:29:32.942
I don't regret anything.
But I'm a little tired.

01:29:37.493 --> 01:29:39.713
I can see...

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:51.110
My friends are there.

01:29:52.967 --> 01:29:57.967
Ask them to come in.
I'll set the table for breakfast.

01:30:01.893 --> 01:30:06.480
"And when the Lamb
opened the seventh seal,

01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:10.275
"there was in heaven a silence

01:30:10.276 --> 01:30:14.529
"which lasted about the space
of half an hour.

01:30:14.530 --> 01:30:19.530
"And the seven angels
who had the seven trumpets

01:30:20.203 --> 01:30:25.203
"prepared themselves to sound.

01:30:36.219 --> 01:30:40.359
"The first angel sounded

01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:44.893
"and there followed hail and fire
mingled with blood,

01:30:44.894 --> 01:30:48.689
"and they were cast upon the earth.

01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:53.485
"And the third part of the earth
was burnt up,

01:30:53.486 --> 01:30:58.486
"and the third part of trees
was burnt up,

01:30:58.574 --> 01:31:03.574
"and all green grass
was burnt up.

01:31:03.871 --> 01:31:08.871
"And the second angel sounded,

01:31:09.085 --> 01:31:13.171
"and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire

01:31:13.172 --> 01:31:16.258
"was cast into the sea.

01:31:16.259 --> 01:31:20.804
"And the third part of the sea
became blood."

01:31:20.805 --> 01:31:24.795
Was there anyone there?

01:31:28.062 --> 01:31:32.292
No, Sire. I saw no one.

01:31:34.861 --> 01:31:39.861
"And the third angel sounded,

01:31:41.034 --> 01:31:45.912
"and there fell a great star
from heaven

01:31:45.913 --> 01:31:50.083
"burning as it were a lamp.

01:31:50.084 --> 01:31:55.084
"And the name of the star
is called Wormwood."

01:32:30.792 --> 01:32:34.482
Good day, noble Sire.

01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:39.670
I am Karin, wife of the knight. I bid
you a courteous welcome to my home.

01:32:42.929 --> 01:32:47.929
I am a blacksmith by trade
and quite good if I say so myself.

01:32:49.185 --> 01:32:54.185
My wife, Lisa.
Curtsey for the honorable Sire, Lisa.

01:32:56.109 --> 01:33:00.570
She's a little difficult at times
and we've had a little affray

01:33:00.571 --> 01:33:04.282
but no worse than most people.

01:33:04.283 --> 01:33:09.283
In our darkness we call out to you, Lord.
Oh, God, have mercy on us.

01:33:11.332 --> 01:33:14.876
For we are small,
afraid and without knowledge.

01:33:14.877 --> 01:33:19.877
In that darkness where you claim to
reside, where we probably all reside,

01:33:20.049 --> 01:33:25.049
you'll find no one that listens to your
complaint or is moved by your suffering.

01:33:25.596 --> 01:33:30.596
- Dry your tears, mirror your apathy.
- God, you that exist somewhere,

01:33:31.769 --> 01:33:36.565
that must exist somewhere,
have mercy on us.

01:33:36.566 --> 01:33:41.528
I had an herb to purge your anxiety
over the eternal. Now it's too late.

01:33:41.529 --> 01:33:46.528
Feel in this final minute the triumph of
rolling your eyes and moving your toes.

01:33:46.867 --> 01:33:51.867
- Quiet... Quiet.
- I'll be quiet, but under protest!

01:34:13.852 --> 01:34:16.522
It is finished.

01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:12.660
Mia! I can see them, Mia.

01:35:12.661 --> 01:35:17.581
I can see them.
Over there under the storm-laden skies.

01:35:17.582 --> 01:35:21.877
They're all there.
The blacksmith and Lisa,

01:35:21.878 --> 01:35:25.589
the knight and Raval, Jöns and Skat...

01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:30.386
And the grim master, Death,
invites them to dance.

01:35:30.387 --> 01:35:35.387
He wants them to hold hands
and dance in a long line.

01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:41.605
And the grim master leads
with scythe and hourglass.

01:35:41.606 --> 01:35:46.527
Skat brings up the rear with his lyre.

01:35:46.528 --> 01:35:50.864
They move away,
away from the dawn,

01:35:50.865 --> 01:35:55.865
in a solemn dance,
away to the dark country.

01:35:56.454 --> 01:36:00.332
Whilst the rain
washes over their faces,

01:36:00.333 --> 01:36:05.333
cleans their cheeks of tears of salt.

01:36:08.216 --> 01:36:13.216
You and your dreams and visions...
