WEBVTT

00:01.894 --> 00:03.694
(softly):
I'm ready.

00:04.630 --> 00:05.996
I'm ready!

00:05.998 --> 00:07.297
Cece, good news.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.599
I'm making you bar manager!

00:09.601 --> 00:11.568
Yeah, I finally want
to focus on my writing.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.437
And you can implement
all the ideas

00:13.439 --> 00:14.938
that you've been suggesting.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.740
All I said was that
the ladies' bathroom

00:16.742 --> 00:18.575
needs more toilet paper.

00:18.577 --> 00:20.911
And I want you to
implement that-- as manager.

00:20.913 --> 00:22.612
All right.
Cece, this could be
your whole future.

00:22.614 --> 00:24.081
What do you say?

00:24.083 --> 00:25.282
"Whole future"
makes it seem like

00:25.284 --> 00:26.750
I'm gonna grow old
and die there,

00:26.752 --> 00:28.185
which is terrifying.
Oh, yeah,

00:28.187 --> 00:29.353
but... yeah...
I mean, I could use

00:29.355 --> 00:31.188
the money...
See, that's what I'm saying!

00:31.190 --> 00:32.756
You could use the money!

00:32.758 --> 00:35.425
If you break it down hourly,
it's<i> less</i> money.

00:35.427 --> 00:36.693
Okay.
Don't do that math.

00:37.429 --> 00:39.262
I'm fat!
I'm ready!

00:39.264 --> 00:41.264
Look at this scarf.
I used to be able to wrap

00:41.266 --> 00:43.100
this scarf exactly...
You go first.

00:43.102 --> 00:45.002
...two and a half times,
and the plaid layers

00:45.004 --> 00:46.837
would blend seamlessly.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.505
Scarf looks fine, Schmidt.
Now the blend is

00:48.507 --> 00:51.008
several degrees from seamless,
a... as you can see.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.943
I've gained six pounds,
maybe six and a half,

00:52.945 --> 00:54.011
I'm sure of it.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.545
Honey, you look
exactly the same to me.

00:55.547 --> 00:57.981
Are you implying you gained
six pounds in your neck?

00:57.983 --> 00:59.049
I let my gym membership lapse

00:59.051 --> 01:00.117
when we were planning
the wedding.

01:00.119 --> 01:01.218
Now instead

01:01.220 --> 01:03.020
of a chiseled ten,
I'm a dumpy seven

01:03.022 --> 01:05.022
breathing down six's back.
But it's fine.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.190
I just have to find a new gym.
Oh, you can

01:07.192 --> 01:09.626
come with me to mine-- I'll
pick you up after work, okay?

01:09.628 --> 01:11.561
Good. Now back
to my thing.

01:11.563 --> 01:13.130
I'm ready!

01:15.300 --> 01:17.968
Oh, sorry.
To start dating again.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.036
Oh.
Oh.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.404
That's great.
I'm so proud of you.

01:20.406 --> 01:21.204
Thanks.
NICK:
Me, too.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.305
About time you got Dr. Sam

01:22.307 --> 01:23.407
out of your system.

01:23.409 --> 01:25.475
Here's a prescription
for the doctor.

01:25.477 --> 01:27.044
Who needs him? (snickering)

01:29.481 --> 01:31.415
(laughing):
Keep talking.

01:32.818 --> 01:34.251
Yes. Totally about Dr. Sam

01:34.253 --> 01:36.253
and definitely not about
any other specific individuals.

01:36.255 --> 01:37.554
Anyway,

01:37.556 --> 01:38.922
I've spent the last few months

01:38.924 --> 01:40.490
self-improving my ass off,

01:40.492 --> 01:42.993
and now I'm ready to get this
bad boy back on the streets.

01:42.995 --> 01:43.894
That's right.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.095
I'm ready!

01:45.097 --> 01:46.329
Schmidt, just
so we're clear.

01:46.331 --> 01:47.731
When you say
you're a seven

01:47.733 --> 01:49.366
breathing down
a six's back,

01:49.368 --> 01:52.002
(whispering):
are you referring to Cece?

01:52.004 --> 01:54.104
Is she the six?

01:54.106 --> 01:55.972
¶ ¶

01:58.610 --> 02:01.011
Come on! Flip it!

02:01.013 --> 02:02.179
Flip it!

02:02.181 --> 02:03.747
Come on, Schmidt, flip it!
Oh, forget it.

02:03.749 --> 02:04.848
What are you doing?

02:04.850 --> 02:05.849
I don't know.

02:05.851 --> 02:07.250
I used to crush at the gym

02:07.252 --> 02:09.586
and now I'm just mediocre,
like early Beyoncé.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.288
Nobody will say it,
but you know it's true.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.889
Look, you're just
shaking the rust off.

02:12.891 --> 02:15.492
You got to run the faucet
till the brown runs out.

02:18.130 --> 02:20.363
Speaking of which,
I have to do the same.

02:20.365 --> 02:22.399
Don't wait up. (chuckles)

02:22.401 --> 02:23.934
Hey, squats, good news.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.902
I'm dating again.
No, thank you.

02:25.904 --> 02:27.270
Never mind.
Okay.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.305
What the hell?

02:28.307 --> 02:30.373
I used to be so good at dating.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.708
I don't think you were.

02:31.710 --> 02:34.044
I had a thing
a certain type responded to.

02:34.046 --> 02:36.313
Hey, Jess, hey, Schmidt.
Hey.

02:36.315 --> 02:37.481
Robby, you go to this gym?
Oh, yeah.

02:37.483 --> 02:38.648
Jess and I
work out all the time.

02:38.650 --> 02:39.950
In fact, everyone from

02:39.952 --> 02:41.551
our singles group
works out here, too.

02:41.553 --> 02:42.552
Jess, who am I right now?

02:42.554 --> 02:43.453
(groans)

02:43.455 --> 02:44.488
Tony!

02:44.490 --> 02:45.889
Tony. That's right. Tony.
(laughs)

02:45.891 --> 02:46.790
(Robby and Jess laughing)

02:46.792 --> 02:47.891
All right.
I'm gonna get a drink

02:47.893 --> 02:49.059
and get back to my workout,

02:49.061 --> 02:50.393
but, uh, need to be careful.

02:50.395 --> 02:52.829
My... I-I tore every single
ligament in my right leg.

02:52.831 --> 02:53.730
The doctor says
I have to focus

02:53.732 --> 02:55.065
on the top until it heals.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.900
Yeah, classic genie workout.

02:56.902 --> 02:59.736
Just let your legs waste away
until they turn into mist.

02:59.738 --> 03:01.338
Guess you got to lift weights
like Tony sleeps.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.140
ROBBY and JESS:
No bottoms.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.541
(Robby and Jess laughing)

03:05.344 --> 03:06.810
We love Tony. All right.

03:06.812 --> 03:07.744
Check you later.

03:07.746 --> 03:08.979
(chuckles)

03:08.981 --> 03:10.413
All right, got to get
back on the horse.

03:10.415 --> 03:12.516
Got to find a guy I can
have some rhythm with.

03:12.518 --> 03:14.417
Ooh. Sweaty guy?

03:14.419 --> 03:16.586
Oh. Guy doing Pilates
in work boots.

03:16.588 --> 03:17.687
Are you doing a bit right now?

03:17.689 --> 03:19.256
What?
Just date Robby.

03:19.258 --> 03:20.991
Oh, Schmidt, not this again.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.592
Why not?
I mean, you guys get along.

03:22.594 --> 03:23.627
He's clearly into you.

03:23.629 --> 03:24.928
You had that whole Tony thing,

03:24.930 --> 03:26.930
which was very inside
and alienating.

03:26.932 --> 03:29.533
Well, I do find Robby
really funny and...

03:29.535 --> 03:31.635
he's as tall as you can be
before it's weird.

03:31.637 --> 03:33.003
See, I'd put him
on the wrong side of that line,

03:33.005 --> 03:34.271
but that's just me.
Who cares what I think?

03:34.273 --> 03:36.206
Jess... go get him.

03:40.646 --> 03:42.345
Oh. It's a colon drop?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.714
Uh, I didn't order this.

03:44.716 --> 03:48.018
Is it just me
or is it<i> colon</i> here?

03:48.020 --> 03:50.053
(laughs) Uh...

04:01.733 --> 04:03.133
Hi, there.

04:03.135 --> 04:05.368
Hey, the birds on your shirt
look a little lonely.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.970
Maybe they could use
some company.

04:06.972 --> 04:07.971
Nah.

04:07.973 --> 04:09.239
They find it very fulfilling

04:09.241 --> 04:10.507
to play amongst themselves.

04:10.509 --> 04:12.609
Find me if they
change their mind.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.645
Was she hitting on us?

04:15.647 --> 04:16.880
Hey, what can I get you?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.582
I guess I'll get some
calamari and some soup.

04:18.584 --> 04:19.649
What's the soup of the day?

04:19.651 --> 04:20.717
Actually,
what I'm talking about?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.152
This is my bar. Who are you?

04:22.154 --> 04:24.154
Oh, Nick,
this is Donovan,

04:24.156 --> 04:26.056
the new bartender
I hired.
Hey.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.057
Hey, Donovan.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.191
Yeah, nice to meet you.

04:28.193 --> 04:30.393
Uh, would you mind
grabbing a-an extra keg?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.595
Got it.

04:31.597 --> 04:32.929
That's a interesting hire.

04:32.931 --> 04:35.865
You-you see, bartenders
are mostly, I don't know,

04:35.867 --> 04:38.001
grizzled guys,
you know, with character

04:38.003 --> 04:39.703
or they're hot women

04:39.705 --> 04:41.605
who bring in grizzled guys
with character.

04:41.607 --> 04:43.506
I know. He's actually
an aspiring model,

04:43.508 --> 04:45.242
and I figure
he'll bring in more women.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.843
How would he bring in
more women?

04:46.845 --> 04:49.079
Because he is super hot.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.447
That guy is super hot?

04:50.449 --> 04:51.448
Yes.

04:51.450 --> 04:52.616
Okay, if you say so.

04:52.618 --> 04:53.617
I don't say so.

04:53.619 --> 04:54.618
The Lord says so.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.119
That boy is off the charts.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.088
I wouldn't know.
Okay, don't be that guy.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.456
I'm not being that guy.
I don't see it.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.391
Don't be the
"Eh, I wouldn't know" guy.

05:01.393 --> 05:02.892
It's a bad color on you.

05:02.894 --> 05:04.261
No, I'm not saying it's a color.
I'm not even making--

05:04.263 --> 05:06.196
Like, I don't see
that he's more handsome.

05:06.198 --> 05:08.265
I have been getting all kinds
of female attention lately.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.100
Did I suddenly get
more attractive?

05:10.102 --> 05:11.534
How should I know?!
I don't see that kind of thing.

05:11.536 --> 05:12.569
I'm just trying to write.

05:12.571 --> 05:13.370
Babe.
Yeah, babe.

05:13.372 --> 05:14.704
Babe.
Yes, babe?

05:14.706 --> 05:16.106
You have a girlfriend now,
which means you've got

05:16.108 --> 05:17.907
a lot of confidence,
and women love that.

05:17.909 --> 05:20.310
Now, if you'll just keep
making it clear that

05:20.312 --> 05:21.444
you have a girlfriend,
it'll pass.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.813
I hate shutting women
down all damn night.

05:23.815 --> 05:26.216
I want to be a source
of light in the world.

05:26.218 --> 05:27.550
Well...

05:27.552 --> 05:29.753
That's why I always
sit at the table

05:29.755 --> 05:31.588
with the little kids first.

05:31.590 --> 05:32.922
(both laugh)

05:32.924 --> 05:35.225
Man, that restaurant
was so weird.

05:35.227 --> 05:36.559
I feel like we were
the only people

05:36.561 --> 05:38.128
not celebrating
a birthday.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.829
Well, it-it was called
Birthdays.

05:39.831 --> 05:40.830
¶ Birthday, birthday,
birthday... ¶

05:40.832 --> 05:42.799
How's the chicken?
Sorry, what?

05:42.801 --> 05:44.401
(people singing loudly)
How-How's your chicken?

05:44.403 --> 05:45.935
What?

05:45.937 --> 05:47.404
I was just saying,
"How is your chicken?"

05:47.406 --> 05:48.672
Oh, yeah.
I have chicken.

05:48.674 --> 05:49.839
Yes. Yeah.

05:49.841 --> 05:51.074
I-I know you have it,

05:51.076 --> 05:52.075
but how...

05:52.077 --> 05:53.310
I ordered the chicken.
What?

05:53.312 --> 05:55.111
I ordered the chicken!

05:55.113 --> 05:56.479
Right, right, right.
Is it good, though?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.181
It was a loud,
horrible restaurant.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.416
(chuckles)
Sorry.

05:59.418 --> 06:02.085
So why did I have so much fun?

06:02.087 --> 06:03.253
Probably the company.

06:03.255 --> 06:04.721
Yeah, I guess so. (chuckles)

06:09.094 --> 06:09.959
Ow. What?

06:09.961 --> 06:11.094
Sorry.
It's okay.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.162
I guess.
(chuckles)

06:12.164 --> 06:13.963
Well, night, pal. Be well.
Oh.

06:13.965 --> 06:15.932
Okay. Uh...

06:27.813 --> 06:29.979
Jess, why are you not
dressed for the gymnasia?

06:29.981 --> 06:31.114
Mm, I'm not going.

06:31.116 --> 06:33.350
Why the hell not?

06:33.352 --> 06:35.618
Oh, is it your birthday?
No. I just...

06:35.620 --> 06:36.820
Did we forget your birthday?
This is terrible.

06:36.822 --> 06:37.821
It's not my birthday.

06:37.823 --> 06:38.888
It's a big one, too, isn't it?

06:38.890 --> 06:41.524
How old do you think I...

06:41.526 --> 06:43.993
No, I'm eating leftovers
from my date with Robby.

06:43.995 --> 06:45.195
Did you go to Birthdays?

06:45.197 --> 06:46.796
You know, if you get a chance,

06:46.798 --> 06:48.631
you should try the Birthdays
Express at the airport.

06:48.633 --> 06:49.899
I like it better. It's del...

06:49.901 --> 06:51.901
Anyway, how was your date?

06:51.903 --> 06:53.536
It was great
and then it was disastrous.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.537
Oh, so you had sex with him?

06:54.539 --> 06:55.672
No.

06:55.674 --> 06:56.673
The opposite.

06:56.675 --> 06:58.208
The opposite?

06:58.210 --> 07:00.143
So you gave birth to him?
No.

07:00.145 --> 07:01.144
It was going really well.

07:01.146 --> 07:02.312
It was fun, and then

07:02.314 --> 07:03.313
at the end,

07:03.315 --> 07:04.681
he clearly wanted to kiss

07:04.683 --> 07:06.983
and I thought I did, too,
and then...

07:06.985 --> 07:09.319
instead I just gave him
the old Pittsburgh good-bye.

07:09.321 --> 07:10.553
Chuck on the arm
and a handshake?

07:10.555 --> 07:11.554
Why would you do that?

07:11.556 --> 07:12.655
Because, I...

07:12.657 --> 07:13.823
(sighs)

07:13.825 --> 07:16.159
In that moment,
I just couldn't see myself

07:16.161 --> 07:18.328
spending the rest
of my life with him.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.663
80 years old,
feeding him pea soup

07:20.665 --> 07:22.399
out of a tin cup.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.768
I'm confused. Is this a
happy ending for Jess Day?

07:24.770 --> 07:26.903
I mean, where are you living
at this point, under a bridge?

07:26.905 --> 07:30.607
I see you and Cece
and Nick and Reagan

07:30.609 --> 07:32.942
and Winston and Furguson...
Aly.

07:32.944 --> 07:34.778
Sorry, that just came out.
Winston and Aly.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.847
And you're all in love,
and I just...

07:37.849 --> 07:40.350
don't know if I'll ever
have that magic with Robby.

07:40.352 --> 07:41.418
See, this just
proves my theory

07:41.420 --> 07:42.852
that if you wee a man,
you would have

07:42.854 --> 07:44.621
a very difficult time
getting an erection.

07:44.623 --> 07:46.689
You have a<i> theory </i>
about that?

07:46.691 --> 07:48.024
You're putting way too much
pressure on yourself.

07:48.026 --> 07:49.359
It's a date, it's not
the rest of your life.

07:49.361 --> 07:51.628
You had a good time, right?
Well, yeah, it was Robby.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.263
He's the funniest guy
in the world.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.297
So lighten up.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.866
If you want to
kiss him, kiss him.

07:56.868 --> 07:58.368
Who knows?

07:58.370 --> 08:00.804
Maybe you'll see if
you have magic then.

08:00.806 --> 08:03.039
You know what? You're right.

08:03.041 --> 08:05.475
I was gonna try to avoid Robby,
but funk that chicken!

08:05.477 --> 08:08.244
I'm gonna go get
my gym clothes on!
Yeah.

08:08.246 --> 08:09.779
I'm gonna put my push-up bra on.
That's actually not a bra

08:09.781 --> 08:11.815
that pushes my breasts up,
it's actually one

08:11.817 --> 08:13.316
that I do push-ups in.
I get it.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.652
Smash these babies down.
Let's do it.

08:17.155 --> 08:19.823
Ooh, no, Cece, you know it's
not Jess's birthday, right?

08:19.825 --> 08:22.225
Put that away.
Yeah, no, I know that.

08:22.227 --> 08:24.060
Um, this gift is for you.

08:24.062 --> 08:26.062
What?
Mm-hmm.

08:26.064 --> 08:28.465
Cece...
It's a scarf.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.933
Yeah. (chuckles)
I love it.

08:29.935 --> 08:32.569
Almost makes me want
to go to Buffalo for work.

08:32.571 --> 08:34.237
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

08:36.741 --> 08:39.909
Look at... Look at that.

08:39.911 --> 08:42.645
Oh, no.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.715
O-Oh, no. Oh, no!

08:47.486 --> 08:50.887
How long does she think
my freakin' neck is?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.324
It's a fat-man scarf.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.926
My wife gave me a fat-man scarf!

08:58.663 --> 09:00.263
I did a few freelance
modeling gigs.

09:00.265 --> 09:03.366
I was, uh, the "wowee face"
for an amusement park ad.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.767
(chuckles)
That's actually really great.

09:04.769 --> 09:07.437
Oh, that was you.
We really gotta
get you working.

09:07.439 --> 09:09.839
Let me take a few photos
to send to a photographer

09:09.841 --> 09:11.608
I used to work with.
Do some model looks.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.610
All right.
Um, this one I call

09:13.612 --> 09:15.778
"I just saw
something patriotic."

09:15.780 --> 09:16.946
All right.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.617
It was an eagle.

09:20.619 --> 09:21.618
I was gonna say eagle.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.152
I want to show some range.

09:23.154 --> 09:25.989
Show me "I just saw
something<i> unpatriotic."</i>

09:25.991 --> 09:28.157
How you gonna pull that off?

09:28.159 --> 09:31.561
Oh.
That's some rich gravy, man.

09:31.563 --> 09:33.863
I noticed you
from across the way.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.298
Can I buy you a drink?

09:35.300 --> 09:38.301
I'm sorry, but let me
be very clear.

09:38.303 --> 09:39.836
I have a girlfriend,

09:39.838 --> 09:41.704
and I am very much so
devoted to her.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.473
(chuckles):
Aw.

09:43.475 --> 09:46.976
Here's my number. Use it.

09:46.978 --> 09:49.145
She didn't listen to a word...

09:50.348 --> 09:52.615
Throw a peanut
out of frustration!

09:55.687 --> 09:58.321
Okay, why are you even here?

09:58.323 --> 09:59.822
I thought the whole
point of promoting me

09:59.824 --> 10:01.357
was so you could
go off and write.

10:01.359 --> 10:03.393
I would love to be writing,
but thanks to you,

10:03.395 --> 10:05.495
all I can do is look
at Donovan's face

10:05.497 --> 10:08.331
and try to figure out why
humans find it appealing.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.099
This is insane--
you have to be able to admit

10:10.101 --> 10:11.234
that he's attractive.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.869
I do-- How would I know?

10:12.871 --> 10:15.271
Nick, please, that dude is
hot as hell, man.

10:15.273 --> 10:18.074
He is a member
of the Hall of Fine.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.777
He's more attractive
than Joe Mangaroni.

10:20.779 --> 10:23.046
Manga-- Joe Mengen--

10:23.048 --> 10:24.380
Who are you thinking of?
Magic Mike's friend.

10:24.382 --> 10:26.616
Oh, he's married to that...
Yeah, J Lo.

10:26.618 --> 10:28.284
Joe Magalini.
Joe Magalini.

10:28.286 --> 10:29.852
He more attractive
than Joe Magalini.

10:29.854 --> 10:33.356
Okay, I know for a fact

10:33.358 --> 10:36.059
that this was the most
attractive man in America

10:36.061 --> 10:37.527
for ten years.

10:37.529 --> 10:40.563
I know that because
magazines told me so.

10:40.565 --> 10:42.799
Okay...
But...

10:42.801 --> 10:46.269
Hey, Donovan,
could you copy that?

10:46.271 --> 10:47.470
You guys don't
look anything alike.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.138
Okay.
Okay.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.776
Are you planning on
speeding up at any point?

10:53.778 --> 10:57.547
Oh, my God, Schmidt,
are you walking on a decline?

10:57.549 --> 10:59.949
This is what we call
a trudge, Jess.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.719
My wife has given up
on me, why shouldn't I?

11:02.721 --> 11:03.886
(imitating police siren)

11:03.888 --> 11:05.788
Uh, license
and registration, please.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.490
(laughs)

11:07.492 --> 11:08.791
I had a great time
last night, you know?

11:08.793 --> 11:11.060
And thank you for taking
that cake off my hands.

11:11.062 --> 11:12.261
I would have eaten it
for breakfast.

11:12.263 --> 11:14.063
Huh, gross, right?
(chuckles)

11:14.065 --> 11:15.331
Better get back
to my uppers.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.466
By the time
this knee is fixed,

11:16.468 --> 11:18.301
I'm gonna look like
the WB frog, you know?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.603
(imitating WB frog):
¶ Ba da bup a duh breeer. ¶

11:20.605 --> 11:21.938
(laughs)

11:21.940 --> 11:25.008
(chuckling):
That guy...

11:25.010 --> 11:27.510
You're the only two people
in here that enjoyed that.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.345
Please go after him.

11:35.253 --> 11:37.253
Hey, need a spot?

11:37.255 --> 11:39.322
Yeah, yeah,
that'd be great, thanks.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.992
Hey, Jess, about last night,
at the end there,

11:42.994 --> 11:44.794
I hope I wasn't...

11:44.796 --> 11:47.096
No, you weren't, and I hope
you didn't think that...

11:47.098 --> 11:48.965
I just kinda thought that
we were in synch, you know?

11:48.967 --> 11:51.267
But then...
No, Robby...

11:52.704 --> 11:54.871
I wanted to kiss you, too.

11:54.873 --> 11:56.339
You did?

11:58.443 --> 12:01.144
Oh.

12:01.146 --> 12:03.813
Oh, well, Jess,
I don't know if this is...

12:03.815 --> 12:05.014
Oh, okay.

12:09.621 --> 12:11.788
(both screaming)

12:11.790 --> 12:13.756
(alarmed chatter)

12:17.028 --> 12:19.462
Somebody call an ambulance.
Robby, are you okay?

12:19.464 --> 12:23.332
I don't know, Robby hurt
his mouth pretty bad here.

12:23.334 --> 12:24.567
It hurts a lot.
It felt good first,

12:24.569 --> 12:26.269
but then it hurts a lot now.

12:30.141 --> 12:32.175
JESS: Just so you know,
this is all your fault.

12:32.177 --> 12:33.409
Oh, well, that's fair.

12:33.411 --> 12:34.977
I should have made it
very clear to you

12:34.979 --> 12:36.913
not to kiss Robby
while he was balancing

12:36.915 --> 12:38.915
a dangerous amount of
weight above his head.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.851
There was a moment
before the bar came down

12:41.853 --> 12:45.221
where it was just
two people kissing,

12:45.223 --> 12:49.025
and... nothing.

12:49.027 --> 12:50.093
No magic.

12:52.263 --> 12:54.697
Look, at least
now you know.

12:54.699 --> 12:55.998
No harm done, right?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.767
A tremendous amount
of harm done.

12:57.769 --> 13:00.837
Now I have to tell a man I
maimed that I'm not interested.

13:00.839 --> 13:03.406
On the bright side,
you're not that hurt.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.708
Come to think of it,
how are you not more hurt?

13:05.710 --> 13:07.210
When I was in triage,
they said that

13:07.212 --> 13:10.246
my neck muscles had served
as kind of a neck helmet,

13:10.248 --> 13:12.915
which made me feel like I was
not talking to real doctors.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.917
Anyway, I just have
to wear this thing

13:14.919 --> 13:16.519
for the next few days
just as a precaution.

13:16.521 --> 13:17.687
Well, if you want
to cover it up,

13:17.689 --> 13:19.422
Cece gave me a scarf
that's perfect.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.258
It's long enough to wrap
around an above-ground pool

13:22.260 --> 13:24.026
filled with Alfredo sauce.

13:24.028 --> 13:26.362
Alfredo sauce.
Doesn't that sound good?

13:26.364 --> 13:28.865
Not really.
I don't know,
maybe Cece's right.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.967
Maybe I am turning
into a fat man.

13:30.969 --> 13:32.635
Cece never called you fat.

13:32.637 --> 13:33.803
Well, I am.

13:33.805 --> 13:36.472
A fat man married
to a hot woman.

13:36.474 --> 13:38.474
Cool, I'm a sitcom.

13:38.476 --> 13:40.276
That sounds like
a great show.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.278
Throw in a wacky neighbor,
I'm watching.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.881
Maybe the reason why
you don't want to go to the gym

13:44.883 --> 13:47.717
is 'cause you want to hang out
with your beautiful wife.

13:47.719 --> 13:49.385
Right?

13:49.387 --> 13:52.288
And you're "fat and happy"
because you're happy.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.894
You're right.

13:57.896 --> 14:00.129
I'm a lucky man.

14:00.131 --> 14:04.467
<i> A Lucky Man</i> should be
the name of your show.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.736
You're a beleaguered casino
owner and a father of three.

14:06.738 --> 14:08.738
MAN: Ms. Day?
Yes?

14:08.740 --> 14:10.740
Mr. Mcferrin's
regained consciousness.

14:10.742 --> 14:11.641
Oh, thank goodness.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.109
You can see him now.

14:13.111 --> 14:14.777
Thank you. All right.

14:14.779 --> 14:17.480
You should go home; this could
be a long conversation.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.817
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

14:20.819 --> 14:23.019
Wait a minute.

14:23.021 --> 14:26.422
Robby's full name
is Robby Mcferrin?

14:27.959 --> 14:29.926
How did I not put
this together?

14:31.129 --> 14:32.695
Hey.
Hey.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.764
I met with that photographer
you sent me to. It went great.

14:34.766 --> 14:36.999
I mean, he even gave me
a free bottle of water.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.201
Ooh.
I felt like a movie star.

14:38.203 --> 14:40.203
(chuckles)
He wants to work together.

14:40.205 --> 14:42.271
That's amazing.
I got these
release forms to sign.

14:42.273 --> 14:44.106
You want me to take
a look at them for you?
Yeah.

14:44.108 --> 14:45.775
Okay. There we go.
(clears throat)

14:50.348 --> 14:53.950
Donovan, these terms
are unacceptable.

14:53.952 --> 14:56.118
He's really screwing you.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.687
Aw...
You know what?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.355
I'm gonna get on
the phone with him,

14:59.357 --> 15:02.058
because if we start treating
our attractive people like this,

15:02.060 --> 15:03.960
our society is
gonna collapse.

15:03.962 --> 15:06.128
(sighs)
Hey, man, you busy writing?

15:06.130 --> 15:08.331
What does it look like?
Want a rainstick?

15:08.333 --> 15:09.999
Some girl gave it to me.

15:10.001 --> 15:11.734
You know, I'm getting a lot
of gifts from women who want

15:11.736 --> 15:14.403
to sleep with me lately.
You know? It's hopeless, man.

15:14.405 --> 15:16.505
I'm so damn confident.

15:16.507 --> 15:18.808
Winston, I was really hoping
to make headway on this,

15:18.810 --> 15:21.377
but, uh, we got to put out
this fire, don't we?

15:21.379 --> 15:22.812
It's hot.
Hmm.

15:22.814 --> 15:24.547
You're too confident.
Too confident ain't the word.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.048
I'm at a whole new level.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.383
Do you remember when
you were taking the bus

15:27.385 --> 15:28.751
to the farmer's market
and it hit a bump

15:28.753 --> 15:29.852
and you soiled yourself?

15:29.854 --> 15:32.488
That was not my favorite
Arbor Day. (laughs)

15:32.490 --> 15:35.024
Why you, uh...
why are you bringing that up?

15:35.026 --> 15:36.559
Remember when you,
uh, were in the park,

15:36.561 --> 15:39.562
and a bee flew into your mouth
and then you fell off the bridge

15:39.564 --> 15:41.831
at that place where all
the ducks go to the bathroom?

15:41.833 --> 15:43.532
I see what you're doing.
Keep it going.
Remember when

15:43.534 --> 15:45.201
you had to leave Lafayette
because you weren't good enough

15:45.203 --> 15:46.736
to be a professional
basketball player,

15:46.738 --> 15:50.172
and you came back home to be
a full-time babysitter?

15:50.174 --> 15:53.376
Okay. All right. Time-out.
You know, you-you hit a nerve.
Okay.

15:53.378 --> 15:55.544
Definitely brought
me down a peg.
I'm sorry.

15:55.546 --> 15:56.879
It's okay. I needed it.
Okay.

15:56.881 --> 15:58.547
Okay.
I feel some
less confident now.

15:58.549 --> 15:59.615
My man.

15:59.617 --> 16:00.917
(chuckles):
All right, then.
(laughs)

16:00.919 --> 16:02.985
All right. Back to my novel.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.125
You're still on that?

16:09.127 --> 16:10.359
I can't figure it out.
Look.

16:10.361 --> 16:12.929
Imagine a world where
you woke up one morning

16:12.931 --> 16:16.432
and instead of your face,
you had Donovan's face.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.234
Whoa.
And instead of your body,

16:18.236 --> 16:20.937
you had his.
How would you feel?

16:20.939 --> 16:23.072
If I had his face and his body?
Oh-hoo, yeah.

16:23.074 --> 16:24.206
I'd feel fantastic.

16:24.208 --> 16:27.109
And that's how you know
he's attractive.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.611
Hmm.
Hmm.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.380
Can I have a minute
with this, please?
Oh, sure thing.

16:31.382 --> 16:34.050
Can I interest you
in some white noise?
Yes, please.

16:34.052 --> 16:36.786
(shakes rainstick)

16:36.788 --> 16:38.854
(rainstick pattering)

16:39.991 --> 16:41.190
Hmm.

16:43.728 --> 16:46.128
(rainstick pattering)

16:46.130 --> 16:48.731
So, when a man

16:48.733 --> 16:52.468
looks like a man that
you wouldn't mind looking like,

16:52.470 --> 16:54.937
that's a way to assess
a man's attractiveness.

16:54.939 --> 16:56.639
Exactly.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.107
Oh!
CECE:
That's right.

16:58.109 --> 17:01.978
You are gonna drop a brand-new
agreement for Donovan to sign.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.646
Hell yeah, you're
gonna have a courier

17:03.648 --> 17:05.414
bring it over to me right now.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.583
And, uh, listen closely, Marco,

17:07.585 --> 17:09.018
Donovan subsection H
is a deal breaker,

17:09.020 --> 17:11.187
so rip it out of
the agreement and burn it!

17:11.189 --> 17:13.422
Or we're walking.

17:13.424 --> 17:15.791
Look forward to hearing
from you. Thanks, bye.

17:15.793 --> 17:16.792
That was amazing.

17:16.794 --> 17:17.927
Yeah.
That was amazing.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.265
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Allen to pulmonary medicine.

17:23.267 --> 17:24.433
Dr. Allen to...

17:24.435 --> 17:25.935
Hey, Robby.

17:25.937 --> 17:27.336
Hi, Jess.
Oh!

17:28.306 --> 17:30.006
(inhales sharply)

17:30.008 --> 17:32.308
You don't look so bad.
(chuckles)

17:32.310 --> 17:34.877
Mm-hmm...
Oh, don't smile.
Don't smile.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.946
You make me want to smile.
Don't! You'll pop a stitch.

17:36.948 --> 17:39.548
Don't smile.
I'm so sorry.
No, don't be.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.685
It was worth it, Jess, because
what happened between us

17:42.687 --> 17:44.520
was so magical.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.788
A dark magic, maybe.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.723
Can I make a confession?
I wish you wouldn't.

17:47.725 --> 17:49.492
When I was under...
Here we go.

17:49.494 --> 17:50.893
...I saw a bright light.

17:50.895 --> 17:54.530
And I felt that I had the choice
to either go into the light

17:54.532 --> 17:56.665
or to come back to you.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.334
And, well, here we are.
Mm.

17:58.336 --> 18:00.002
This is gonna be a tough one.

18:00.004 --> 18:02.238
You know what's so great?
No, I don't.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.674
Our first kiss is gonna be
such a good story to tell.

18:05.676 --> 18:07.076
It's not that good of a story.

18:07.078 --> 18:08.377
Pretty good story.
Robby,

18:08.379 --> 18:10.079
I have something to tell you.

18:10.081 --> 18:11.247
I...
Mm-hmm?
(crunches)

18:11.249 --> 18:13.416
(screams)
Oh, my God!
Your bad knee!

18:13.418 --> 18:15.851
Oh, my God!
I'll get someone to help!
(groaning)

18:15.853 --> 18:18.254
Aah... (groans)

18:21.159 --> 18:23.159
(mouth full):
Mm. There she is.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.327
Jess. Big news.

18:25.329 --> 18:26.762
I realized that you were right.

18:26.764 --> 18:29.331
I'm happy because Cece loves me,

18:29.333 --> 18:31.167
and she's gonna love me
no matter what,

18:31.169 --> 18:34.670
even if I turn into
a bloated Ashkenazi marshmallow.

18:34.672 --> 18:37.006
Turns out, I don't have
to work out ever again.

18:37.008 --> 18:39.442
I can eat as much as I want
and still be happy.

18:39.444 --> 18:41.277
Ooh. How'd your thing go?

18:41.279 --> 18:43.012
Break the news to Robby?
No.

18:43.014 --> 18:46.015
Before I could break his heart,
I shattered his leg.

18:46.017 --> 18:49.351
It's now in two
pieces, connected by

18:49.353 --> 18:51.720
a skin tunnel where
his knee should be.

18:51.722 --> 18:53.122
Hmm.

18:53.124 --> 18:55.257
So you've broken him twice now.
(sighs)

18:55.259 --> 18:57.893
How am I supposed to tell him
I'm not interested now?

18:57.895 --> 18:59.528
I don't think you have
any other choice.

18:59.530 --> 19:00.896
I mean, what are you gonna do?

19:00.898 --> 19:02.631
You're just gonna
pretend to be into him

19:02.633 --> 19:04.967
and then nurse him for
the rest of your life?

19:06.404 --> 19:08.737
Okay, Robby, time for your soup.
(grunts)

19:08.739 --> 19:10.439
Good morning.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.409
In a strange way, I find this
to be deeply romantic.
Yes.

19:13.411 --> 19:16.445
It's very romantic,
waiting for his body to heal

19:16.447 --> 19:18.080
before I destroy his soul.

19:18.082 --> 19:20.549
Cling, clung,
I got a robot dong.

19:20.551 --> 19:23.819
I got a robot dong
goes cling, cling, cling...

19:23.821 --> 19:25.955
You got to love Robby.
He's been singing that a lot.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.623
Cece.
Hmm?

19:27.625 --> 19:30.292
You've done a great job, but
I'm gonna have to demote you.
Huh?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.894
Shouldn't be a manager...

19:31.896 --> 19:33.596
because you should be a manager.

19:33.598 --> 19:36.265
Are you just saying words
in no particular order?

19:36.267 --> 19:38.901
We asked Donovan to bring in a
couple of his "hottest friends."

19:38.903 --> 19:40.469
(chuckles)
And he sure did.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.770
And I know that
because I wouldn't mind

19:41.772 --> 19:42.972
having their faces.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.440
And I wouldn't mind
having their bodies.

19:44.442 --> 19:45.441
Okay.
WINSTON:
We saw you on the phone

19:45.443 --> 19:46.675
with that photographer,

19:46.677 --> 19:48.511
and you have a gift.

19:48.513 --> 19:51.080
You shouldn't be
managing a bar.

19:51.082 --> 19:52.815
You should be managing people
like Donovan.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.518
Beautiful idiots? No offense.
Oh. (scoffs)

19:55.520 --> 19:57.486
And these objectively
handsome men.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.787
They're models, too.
Just like me.

19:58.789 --> 20:00.156
Me managing models?

20:00.158 --> 20:01.423
Just like him
and him and him.

20:01.425 --> 20:02.958
Yeah. They're all models
just like him.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.693
Well, I do know the business.

20:04.695 --> 20:06.095
And I hate working here.

20:06.097 --> 20:07.663
Easy.
I mean, I'm gonna keep

20:07.665 --> 20:09.632
working here. I need the cash.
Schmidt is eating us

20:09.634 --> 20:11.100
out of house and home.
SCHMIDT:
Barkeep!

20:11.102 --> 20:12.801
Mudslide, extra whip.

20:12.803 --> 20:14.837
Coming right up, babe.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.006
You know what?

20:17.008 --> 20:20.142
All right.
I think that I'll do it.

20:20.144 --> 20:22.344
Ha, ha!
Okay, guys. Let's see
what you're working with.

20:23.681 --> 20:27.183
I actually just meant
show me a portfolio, but...

20:27.185 --> 20:28.851
that'll do.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.786
(sighs):
Where's my mudslide?

20:33.357 --> 20:34.557
Who are these?

20:34.559 --> 20:36.325
My new... clients.

20:36.327 --> 20:39.361
Honey, I think
I'm gonna start managing models.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.331
Are you rea... that's a...
that's amazing.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.167
Congratulations, Cece. I think
you'd be really great at that.

20:45.169 --> 20:46.969
Proud of you.
Yeah?

20:46.971 --> 20:49.305
So, you'll just be swimming
in beefcakes all day

20:49.307 --> 20:51.140
and then you'll just...
be coming home

20:51.142 --> 20:54.176
to this sock full of meatloaf.
(laughs)

20:54.178 --> 20:56.245
Uh-uh, sister.
Not gonna happen.

20:56.247 --> 20:58.514
I'm going back to the gym.

20:58.516 --> 21:01.183
Don't need this fat man scarf.

21:01.185 --> 21:02.685
Want help? You got it?
You didn't like my gift?

21:02.687 --> 21:04.019
It just goes on forever.

21:04.021 --> 21:06.388
You literally
just got to take it off.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.890
Why'd you do that?

21:07.892 --> 21:08.891
Hey, what am I missing?

21:08.893 --> 21:10.392
Cece's gonna manage models.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.027
I can't hear anything
from over here.

21:12.029 --> 21:13.495
I'm gonna come over.

21:13.497 --> 21:15.197
You guys are really
good-looking.
Thank you, man.

21:15.199 --> 21:17.032
Not you. These three.
Oh.

21:17.034 --> 21:18.167
Don't celebrate without me.

21:18.169 --> 21:19.702
(grunts)
WINSTON:
Oh!
Oh, sorry!

21:19.704 --> 21:22.504
Oh. Sorry.
You got to...
Oh!

21:22.506 --> 21:23.906
(grunting)
Okay...
Just move your foot
a little bit...

21:23.908 --> 21:25.941
Aah, you just...
I can't get it out.

21:25.943 --> 21:28.043
Okay, one of us should help.
I know, we should help.
Somebody...

21:28.045 --> 21:29.912
Can you just lift
your foot a little bit...
NICK: That way, that way.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.280
You're hurting him.
Go like this.
Oh! Sorry!

21:31.282 --> 21:32.414
Go like this! Go like...

21:32.416 --> 21:33.682
No. That's not helping.

21:33.684 --> 21:35.884
Oh, aah! Sorry.
NICK:
I've got an axe.

21:35.886 --> 21:36.885
<i> I've got an axe in the back.</i>

21:36.887 --> 21:38.053
<i> I'm gonna cut his leg off.</i>
