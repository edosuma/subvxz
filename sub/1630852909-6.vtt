00:06.000 --> 00:09.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.000 --> 00:15.200
<i>Your hands, your caresses</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:18.800
<i>Feel like this</i>

00:18.880 --> 00:23.280
<i>That feeling--</i>

00:25.560 --> 00:27.160
What happened?

00:29.400 --> 00:31.680
-Nothing's wrong.
-Don't leave.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.240
We'll fix it in five minutes.
Guys, please.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.320
-Luz, are you all right? What's wrong?
-I had a nightmare.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.880
It was horrible.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.040
Would you like to talk about it?

00:50.960 --> 00:54.200
Or we don't have to talk about it.
I'm good with not talking.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.920
There's not much to talk about.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.760
Sky Vibes was a total disaster.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.760
You know what?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.160
One time someone I knew

01:07.240 --> 01:13.120
told me something about every failure
being an opportunity to learn.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.760
-That sounds familiar.
-Yeah?

01:32.760 --> 01:35.720
Good afternoon.
On behalf of the Cielo Grande staff,

01:35.800 --> 01:38.160
I wanted to say
we're very happy and thankful

01:38.240 --> 01:42.600
for your interest and participation
in the Cielo Grande Summer Crush.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.880
Great!

01:43.960 --> 01:48.440
This year we have two possible locations
open for the competition.

01:48.520 --> 01:53.240
One, on the Correntoso River.
The other in Canal del Norte.

01:53.320 --> 01:57.240
But today I'm not gonna announce
which one it'll be.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.560
We'll know
the night before the competition.

01:59.640 --> 02:00.600
Starting now,

02:01.320 --> 02:03.600
you can train on and analyze both rivers.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.560
I'll leave you to prepare your strategies.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.000
-All right!
-Thanks, Augusto.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.160
We're pretty even.
Nobody knows the rivers.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.640
We have Luz, who's a local.
That gives us an advantage.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.080
-Let's get ready. Come on.
-Let's go.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.080
Where are you going so fast?

02:25.040 --> 02:26.880
You already dropped out, right?

02:29.160 --> 02:31.160
<i>-Know what caused the blackout?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

02:31.240 --> 02:33.480
Seems it was a short circuit in the sign.

02:33.560 --> 02:38.000
I don't know if it was humidity or what<i>,</i>
but I found several burnt-out bulbs.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.120
Luckily it wasn't serious,
or we'd have to cancel.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.360
It's my fault.
I was too rushed with the opening.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.280
-At least we still have the competition.
-We need a miracle.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.040
-What? No.
-Yeah, look at this.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.400
-What?
-What's going on?

02:51.480 --> 02:55.480
The twins' video at Sky Vibes
has more than a million views.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.440
No!

02:56.520 --> 02:58.960
That's the closest to a miracle I've seen.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.360
-Listen.
-Incredible.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.320
"Amazing!" "Not even the power outage
can compete."

03:03.400 --> 03:05.840
"Really good show."
"More twins at Sky Vibes."

03:05.920 --> 03:10.240
"Put up more Sky Vibes videos."
And it goes on and on and on.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.120
And this pic?

03:14.240 --> 03:16.560
The twins posted
a pic of my mom. What's up?

03:16.640 --> 03:17.680
Let's see.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.720
Your mom?

03:20.320 --> 03:21.560
Why?

03:21.640 --> 03:22.480
I don't know.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.680
Can you tell me
where you got this picture?

03:38.280 --> 03:40.440
Don't lie. It was in your jacket.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.800
Ian.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.200
-Steffi's gonna kill me.
-Steffi?

03:53.960 --> 03:55.440
-Guys.
-Luz.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.560
Our video already has 200,000 likes.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.040
-Seriously, the karaoke was a success.
-Yeah.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.960
When I saw, I couldn't believe it.
You guys are awesome.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.800
Changing the subject,
why did you post this picture?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.560
That's from Ian.
He wanted to know who that girl was.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.000
-Do you know her?
-Yeah, she's my mom.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.560
Ian, why did you ask the twins
to post this picture of my mom?

04:27.880 --> 04:29.760
-Your mom?
-Yeah, my mom.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.240
You asked them to post it?

04:32.960 --> 04:34.640
Yeah, it's…

04:35.760 --> 04:38.400
-Your mom's in the pic?
-Yeah, her name is Cynthia.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.560
Is she here?

04:39.640 --> 04:43.880
No, she hasn't come to Cielo in years.
This pic is from a long time ago.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.360
There's wind from the south.
The Correntoso River is the best option.

04:55.000 --> 04:55.840
Okay.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.320
You decide.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.360
You're the one who knows this place best.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.000
-Are we having dinner together?
-Together?

05:06.960 --> 05:07.880
Like a date?

05:08.920 --> 05:09.760
Yeah.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.480
Something like that.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.920
So

05:18.000 --> 05:18.840
is that a yes?

05:19.960 --> 05:20.800
Yes.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.520
Irene.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.520
Isn't that Steffi?

06:07.320 --> 06:09.760
What are you doing?
I'll report you to Augusto!

06:09.840 --> 06:11.920
-That's not very professional.
-Luz!

06:12.000 --> 06:14.880
Don't do anything. Really.
You'll just make things worse.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.360
Let's avoid awakening
the monster inside her.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.120
You don't want to see it.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.040
They're going to the canal. No wind.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.440
We'll follow the plan
and go to Correntoso.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.520
The further away from her, the better.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.360
Think these conditions
could appear during the competition?

07:06.440 --> 07:07.640
It's likely.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.400
The river's rough
when there's a south wind like now,

07:10.480 --> 07:12.200
and it could happen.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.160
On the other hand, Canal del Norte
is sheltered and seems calmer.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.080
What we have to do is adjust
your technique to the bad conditions.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.120
If the competition is like this,
you'll have a big advantage.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.120
Yeah, I agree.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.360
Luz's strategy is good.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.600
All right, I'm gonna get ready then.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.440
Excuse me.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.960
Here, watch.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.000
You have room for one more trick
before the buoy.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.600
If you do a spin
instead of doing a back flip,

07:41.680 --> 07:43.920
you'll have a big advantage over Steffi.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.120
Okay, let's see.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.280
-Yeah.
-Here.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.720
Natasha, this is Fer, the shy guy.
He wants to ask you something.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.400
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

08:05.120 --> 08:08.200
Is your brother coming too?
He's really nice.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.200
No, guys. You have dinner.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.960
Juan, right?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.040
Yeah.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.320
Look. If you both don't come,
there'll be no dinner.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.320
Simple.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.960
We should record one of your runs
and see what to adjust. Don't you think?

08:30.040 --> 08:32.520
Hi, Steffi.
I'm inviting you to dinner tonight.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.040
-It's a double date.
-A double date?

08:35.120 --> 08:36.800
Yeah, two couples equals four.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.080
Two influencers and two wakeboarders.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.160
-It might even be--
-Eat with Natasha?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.960
-Not even as a joke.
-No? I thought you got along well.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.600
Natasha is a really bad person.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.840
Really? She's always been
friendly and charming with us.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.560
A snake charmer.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.040
She's the devil incarnate. Look.

09:02.680 --> 09:06.400
-Natasha kissing a guy. What about it?
-That guy was my boyfriend.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.160
Plus, she published it everywhere
to humiliate me even more.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.560
What kind of guy would do that to you?
That's unacceptable.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.120
Thanks, Juan. You're really a good friend.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.840
But forget about me
at the same table as Natasha.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.760
All right.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.440
Bye.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.400
I think you had him hypnotized.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.720
Look at this. Look.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.040
Look. It's incredible.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.680
Luz, did you see this?

09:37.760 --> 09:40.640
The twins' video has double its views
since this morning.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.400
If you'd told me the blackout was a dream,
I would've believed it.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.720
I had my doubts
about working with the twins at first.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.680
-But it was a great idea.
-Yeah.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.520
Yeah. No one could've imagined
something like this.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.040
It was a black swan.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.680
Sorry, why black? Because of the blackout?

09:57.760 --> 10:00.040
No, Charlie. It's a theory

10:00.120 --> 10:03.400
about a surprising fact,
something unplanned, like yesterday.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.760
But still, you have to admit, without Luz,

10:06.840 --> 10:09.800
we wouldn't have Sky Vibes
or the black swan, would we?

10:09.880 --> 10:11.880
-Without Luz.
-Without light.

10:12.480 --> 10:17.560
Guys, maybe we should
put together a Sky Vibes channel.

10:17.640 --> 10:18.480
Yeah.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.760
First step, "Save Cielo."

10:23.840 --> 10:25.240
NEW GROUP
SAVE CIELO

10:25.320 --> 10:26.320
-Really good.
-Ready.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.800
-That's it. Great.
-Awesome.

10:30.120 --> 10:30.960
Charlie.

10:31.960 --> 10:35.000
It's an idea that Luz had.
We've already planned everything.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.720
Luz and her ideas, of course.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.120
We're gonna organize a show
to relaunch Sky Vibes. "Save Cielo."

10:40.200 --> 10:42.840
-And we're gonna stream it.
-Stream?

10:42.920 --> 10:44.320
Yeah, I'm handling that.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.240
Yeah. They're asking for more videos.
We're gonna start a Sky Vibes channel.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.680
We're also gonna make
a sponsorship page to raise funds.

10:51.760 --> 10:55.800
Twins, welcome to the group.
Can we count on you to save Cielo?

10:55.880 --> 10:58.680
-And when is the show?
-The night after the competition.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.200
You have everything planned.

11:00.280 --> 11:04.080
-Remember you can't spend--
-Not even a single peso.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.600
We already know that.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.400
<i>Come on, honey. Great. Count on us.</i>

11:08.480 --> 11:09.320
Great.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.640
Awesome. I'll tell you about it later.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.920
Let's go! Great!

11:15.200 --> 11:18.960
Try to rest a little so we can start
on the Correntoso River tomorrow.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.920
Also, we have to analyze
and test Canal del Norte.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.760
It's gonna be a hard day.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.200
See you later.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.200
Steffi, I've finally found you.
We have to talk.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.160
I can't right now. Let's talk later.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.000
Listen. I got away from Dad.
I don't have much time.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.240
-I have good news and bad news.
-What?

11:39.320 --> 11:40.600
I know who's in the pic.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.880
-It's Luz's mom.
-What? Luz's mom? Are you sure?

11:45.960 --> 11:48.520
Yeah. Her name's Cynthia.
Luz told me herself.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.880
Is that the bad news?

11:52.400 --> 11:55.640
No, that's the good news. The bad news is

11:56.880 --> 11:58.600
Dad took it. He knows it's yours.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.480
What? I can't believe it, Ian.
Let's talk later.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.280
I'll be by for my chocolate later, okay?

12:10.160 --> 12:13.520
Well, rust and moisture
create false contacts.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.800
What happens when moisture accumulates

12:15.880 --> 12:20.320
is, if the cables aren't well adjusted,
which is what happened, sparks generate.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.760
-A short circuit.
-No!

12:22.840 --> 12:23.760
Sorry.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.400
Nati, can you help me with the tape?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.560
I need electrical tape.
I think it's in the toolbox.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.640
I'll remove this and put a new--

12:32.720 --> 12:34.840
-Is this it?
-Yes. Perfect.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.480
With this here, everything will be fixed.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.800
Perfec-- Oh no. Well, not totally fixed.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.640
But at least
the lights won't go out again.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.520
Nati.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.200
You know…

12:59.840 --> 13:02.960
You know you're the prettiest girl
at Cielo Grande?

13:04.240 --> 13:06.920
And you're the prettiest girl
in the whole city,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.320
the whole country,
and the whole continent.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.200
-And I would love--
-Charlie.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.120
What?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.160
I like a girl.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.640
Okay.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.040
"Williams, Aguilar, and Giordano."

14:32.200 --> 14:33.760
<i>Hello. Reception.</i>

14:33.840 --> 14:38.880
Hello. Tomorrow I have a class
with the instructor Luz.

14:38.960 --> 14:39.920
<i>Luz?</i>

14:40.000 --> 14:42.800
Could you tell me her last name?
I don't remember.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.560
<i>Yes. Aguilar.</i>

14:45.320 --> 14:46.160
Thanks. Bye.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.160
What happened between my dad and you?

15:27.120 --> 15:31.040
What do you think of this video
for the background for one of the songs?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.640
-I love it.
-I love it.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.320
-Great.
-Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.400
How exciting, Charlie.
The Sky Vibes channel came out great.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.800
Yeah, it still needs a design.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.240
I'll make a couple of banners
to tweak it a bit.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.360
I wanna try something later.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.440
We need to do the sponsorship page.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.760
Those who see the show
can collaborate with Save Cielo.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.200
Yeah, we have to design it
and embed the video in the page.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.280
-We have to test that too.
-Okay.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.480
Shouldn't we have more songs for the show?

15:59.560 --> 16:00.640
Yes.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.560
We have one in the works.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.400
Let's hear it.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.280
All right.

16:16.800 --> 16:20.240
<i>Day by day, I look for</i>

16:20.320 --> 16:24.080
<i>Your gaze in mine</i>

16:24.160 --> 16:27.840
<i>That yesterday I was losing it</i>

16:27.920 --> 16:31.360
<i>And I felt you a thousand steps away</i>

16:31.960 --> 16:35.200
<i>You are by my side</i>

16:35.720 --> 16:39.520
<i>But after a while you are leaving</i>

16:41.320 --> 16:43.080
-What do you think?
-Really pretty.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.280
What do you think if,

16:44.360 --> 16:48.960
instead of "yesterday I was losing it,"
we go with "yesterday I saw you"?

16:49.040 --> 16:52.360
Because "losing" sounds dramatic,
and "saw" is more genuine.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.400
Yeah, maybe.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.920
All right. Let's try it.

16:56.720 --> 17:00.360
<i>That yesterday I saw you</i>

17:00.960 --> 17:05.080
<i>And I felt you a thousand steps away</i>

17:05.160 --> 17:06.360
-Yeah.
-I like it.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.440
-You guys? Yeah?
-Yeah.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.800
All right,
and the chorus would go like this.

17:13.960 --> 17:18.520
<i>I find myself a thousand steps away</i>

17:18.600 --> 17:22.760
<i>I can't help it</i>

17:23.360 --> 17:27.640
<i>It will be fear, I go back to zero</i>

17:28.840 --> 17:30.560
<i>And I walk away</i>

17:31.600 --> 17:34.960
<i>Trying</i>

17:36.320 --> 17:37.680
It's missing something.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.760
-It needs something else.<i> </i>Doesn't it?
-Yeah.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.000
The lyrics and the melody
are pretty, Nati.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.560
The only thing I can think of
is adding something to the music.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.040
Pass me the guitar.

17:48.840 --> 17:53.520
-You're going "do" and "fa."
-Yeah.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.360
Look, instead of "do,"
you could go with seventh "do,"

17:57.440 --> 17:59.200
and it adds a little color.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.240
<i>Day by day, I look for</i>

18:08.320 --> 18:11.680
<i>Your gaze in mine</i>

18:11.760 --> 18:14.560
<i>That yesterday I saw you</i>

18:14.640 --> 18:17.600
<i>And I felt you a thousand steps away</i>

18:17.680 --> 18:20.920
<i>You are by my side</i>

18:21.000 --> 18:24.120
<i>But after a while you are leaving</i>

18:24.200 --> 18:27.040
<i>This image that I do not forget</i>

18:27.120 --> 18:31.120
<i>And insists that I return</i>

18:32.640 --> 18:36.640
Yes. I love it, Juli.
Those chords sound a lot better.

18:36.720 --> 18:41.000
Yeah. Looking for a better version
of a song together is so much better.

18:41.080 --> 18:41.920
All right.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.960
One more, and the show is done.
What's the next one?

19:02.800 --> 19:06.120
Well, we have a toasted eggplant
with pomegranate and pistachio

19:06.200 --> 19:07.320
for Natasha.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.960
I have some pita bread for you.
Who is the hummus for?

19:11.040 --> 19:12.640
Juan and I are gonna share it.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.480
Well, obviously
if Natasha wants to try it, she can.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.920
It's so nice you decided to come.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.840
Luz and Tony already had plans,
and I hate eating alone.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.400
Well, I'm glad to know I'm your plan B.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.160
No, not at all.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.640
Actually, I like eating here with you.
You're my plan A.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.080
Alternative.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.360
Listen, do you know Cynthia, Luz's mom?

19:44.440 --> 19:46.040
I found out she competed here.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.520
Of course.
But I've never seen her compete.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.560
When Luz was born, her father left them,
and she raised her alone.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.680
And so she didn't keep training.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.760
It must've been really hard for them.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.120
-Do you know anything about the dad?
-No.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.880
Only that he never showed up.
I think he's a foreign wakeboarder.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.480
But Luz doesn't like to talk about him.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.040
She says he never wanted her.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.480
What are you thinking?

20:13.800 --> 20:15.520
Nothing. I don't want to bore you.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.360
It's impossible for you to bore me.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.320
Excuse me, guys.
I'm going to the bathroom.

20:23.960 --> 20:24.960
You know what?

20:25.640 --> 20:28.560
I think you, Fer,
have a lot more personality than Juan.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.320
Why do you always let him
take the initiative?

20:31.400 --> 20:34.000
I don't know what you mean.
I also have initiative.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.120
Let's go look at the stars.

20:39.640 --> 20:40.960
The night is beautiful.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.000
Let's wait for my brother, all right?

20:46.080 --> 20:49.000
And you call that taking initiative, Fer?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.680
Did you see the stars tonight?

20:55.760 --> 20:57.240
Incredible, aren't they?

20:57.760 --> 20:58.600
Yeah.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.520
Seems like Steffi and Julián
are getting along.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.720
Like us.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.840
Your mom wakeboarded?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.800
I suppose there's a lot
you don't know about me.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.040
Bro, where are you? I'm here at the table.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.360
-What's going on?
-What's up?

21:38.800 --> 21:41.440
Man, I think Natasha is manipulating Fer.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.200
But he doesn't realize it.
It's like he doesn't want to see.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.080
A second ago, the three of us were here,

21:48.160 --> 21:50.680
and suddenly he just disappears
without telling me.

21:52.120 --> 21:52.960
Look.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.960
If he's in love, he won't listen to you,
no matter what you say.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.320
My advice is

22:02.440 --> 22:04.160
don't try to separate them

22:04.240 --> 22:06.680
because you'll end up fighting
with your brother.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.960
Yeah, but I have to do something.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.840
You're the love expert here.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.720
What do you think when a girl says,

22:17.440 --> 22:20.440
"What a good friend you are,"
after you say something nice.

22:21.920 --> 22:25.760
Let's see. 1.5% romance

22:27.720 --> 22:30.320
and 98.5% friend zone.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.840
Well, that 1.5% gives me hope.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.440
Listen to me.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.320
I understand this,

22:42.040 --> 22:47.800
and if she told you like that,
I'm 100% sure you have no chance.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.360
Well, 98.5%.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.760
Here they come.
For anything else, we'll talk later.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.720
The stars are impressive.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.440
Do you want dessert?

23:11.080 --> 23:15.000
Impressive that the only one who managed
to get out of the friend zone is Fer.

23:15.080 --> 23:15.920
Yeah.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.640
I just entered it.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.280
What?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.400
No, not possible.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.920
No one could friend zone you.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.120
Welcome to the club.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.080
I already know what we should write about.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.200
The friend zone!

24:04.280 --> 24:06.600
-Again with that, Charlie?
-Seriously. Look.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.440
<i>Friend, friend, friend zone</i>

24:16.520 --> 24:19.240
<i>Friend, friend, friend zone</i>

24:19.320 --> 24:21.880
<i>You don't want to go in</i>
<i>You want to go out</i>

24:21.960 --> 24:24.560
<i>I didn't see you arrive</i>
<i>I didn't see you leave</i>

24:24.640 --> 24:27.160
<i>Friend zone, friend zone</i>

24:27.880 --> 24:29.480
Bravo!

24:30.400 --> 24:31.440
Really good!

24:31.520 --> 24:33.480
-What did you think?
-I don't know, man.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.560
Honestly, I would change the lyrics.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.200
It's very literal.

24:37.280 --> 24:41.040
But I just thought maybe
we could use something I wrote.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.400
Let's see.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.800
"I feel the only option."

24:46.520 --> 24:48.560
"I think there's no love here."

24:49.440 --> 24:51.920
"I'm suffering." "I can't avoid it."

24:52.520 --> 24:54.640
"I'm crying." "I resign to accept."

24:55.440 --> 24:57.520
You come up with such great lyrics.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.080
You should write our songs.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.080
Thanks.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.120
Well, we could start to do them with Luz.

25:06.160 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.520
Well, how's it going with Nati?

25:16.720 --> 25:18.920
Deep in the friend zone.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.080
-Yeah? Are you sure?
-Yeah, totally sure.

25:24.680 --> 25:28.000
Julián says I should do a report
about the friend zone for you.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.720
-Isn't that ridiculous?
-That's an awesome idea.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.520
A report about the friend zone.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.440
-That would be amazing.
-Really?

25:34.520 --> 25:37.000
A song and a report about the friend zone.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.880
That would definitely affect my image.
I'm gonna have to think about it.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.080
Done. Great.

25:51.720 --> 25:52.680
Look.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.440
Well, tonight was great.

25:56.520 --> 26:00.920
Of course. You were with me.
But really, thanks so much for everything.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.320
Good night, favorite twin. Sweet dreams.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.160
Good night.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.200
Steffi.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.960
Dad, what are you doing here?
We have an agreement.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.280
The agreement is off.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.680
What are looking for with this?

26:25.560 --> 26:26.960
<i>I kept thinking</i>

26:27.520 --> 26:29.920
how is it that the Correntoso River

26:30.000 --> 26:32.400
has a bigger swell than Canal del Norte?

26:33.560 --> 26:34.400
Well,

26:34.960 --> 26:39.040
that's because the narrower rivers
that aren't sheltered from the wind

26:39.120 --> 26:40.760
tend to have more waves.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.360
Also, when there's a south wind,
the Correntoso flows right into it.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.960
Look, if this is the south,
the Correntoso goes in this direction.

26:50.040 --> 26:50.880
Get it?

26:52.400 --> 26:53.240
Yeah.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.120
Now I get it.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.240
You already knew this, didn't you?

27:03.280 --> 27:04.280
True.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.680
But… I like listening to you.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.680
Why didn't you tell me
you had a girlfriend here?

27:37.760 --> 27:39.800
And that it was Luz's mom.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.280
What are you talking about?

27:41.360 --> 27:44.320
Enough, Dad. Stop lying to me.
I saw your pictures with her.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.720
I also saw what you wrote
in the guest book.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.840
"The best trophy isn't always
the one you carry in your suitcase,

27:53.920 --> 27:56.440
because as well as the river,
this enchanted place,

27:56.520 --> 27:57.880
and the magical stars,

27:57.960 --> 27:58.920
I found love."

27:59.520 --> 28:04.160
"I hope to return really soon.
Ron Navarro Lavalle. Guadalajara, Mexico."

28:06.560 --> 28:08.320
That's why you came here, isn't it?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.680
The competition is just an excuse.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.320
Don't talk to me about excuses.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.400
You're lying to me.
And I know you also lied to my mom.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.920
What secret are you hiding
at Cielo Grande, Dad?
