00:36.245 --> 00:38.682
This was Dad's church,

00:38.706 --> 00:41.393
a place where people knew love,

00:41.417 --> 00:45.379
a place to find peace,
comfort, and forgiveness.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.717
God blessed this church.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.905
For 30 years, Dad led
the people here.

00:53.929 --> 00:57.576
He touched the lives of
all those around him,

00:57.600 --> 00:59.185
none more than me.

01:02.062 --> 01:06.233
I wanted to be that kind of
man, and that kind of pastor.

01:07.943 --> 01:12.114
After Dad passed, his
ministry became my ministry.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.367
His mission, my mission.

01:17.036 --> 01:20.039
But things have never
been the same.

- Let us pray.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.095
- Hi.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.119
- Deacon.

03:24.747 --> 03:27.392
- Not bad, Pastor, not bad.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.768
- Thank you.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.629
- Almost as good as your father.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.255
- Almost.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.799
- Pastor John!

03:37.885 --> 03:39.946
Pastor John, hey!

03:39.970 --> 03:41.889
Over here, hey, John!

03:42.806 --> 03:43.806
John, hey!

03:44.934 --> 03:46.077
Good day?

03:46.101 --> 03:48.204
- Great day, Pastor Pendergrass.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.041
- The Lord blessed us with 527.

03:51.065 --> 03:54.294
Five, two, seven!

03:54.318 --> 03:56.671
Almost half a grand of blessing.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.423
I thought your yoke was
supposed to be easy?

03:58.447 --> 03:59.716
I'm kidding.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.300
'Cause that's the Lord,
that's the Lord,

04:01.324 --> 04:02.802
it's not Pastor Eye Candy, okay.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.804
It's the Lord, it really is.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.890
What.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.082
How about you?

04:09.833 --> 04:11.835
- Not quite that many.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.648
- You know, I'm not sure.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.858
- Sorry, I'm sorry,
how many did you say?

04:16.882 --> 04:17.882
- Fi-fi, 50.

04:18.653 --> 04:19.653
About.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.678
- Well, could be better.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.324
You know, should be better.

04:24.348 --> 04:28.286
I just want you to know
that if you need some help,

04:28.310 --> 04:30.914
I'm here, my doors are open.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.999
Has to be open when you
have 527 comin' through,

04:33.023 --> 04:34.376
am I right

04:34.400 --> 04:36.120
I'm kidding though, I
am here for you, okay?

04:38.237 --> 04:39.547
- Five o'clock.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.467
Okay, you're gonna do great.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.094
Can we please go home now?

04:44.118 --> 04:46.537
- I thought you'd never ask.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.812
Those walls have
always been white.

04:53.836 --> 04:57.273
I've grown quite accustomed
to seeing them white.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.025
- I like white.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.361
- There's nothing
wrong with white.

05:01.385 --> 05:04.447
- White is clean, white is pure.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.908
- He washed our sins white.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.828
- White as snow, white as snow.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.413
Amen.

05:11.437 --> 05:14.624
- Yes amen, amen, but we're
talking about a room

05:14.648 --> 05:17.168
dedicated to the children's
ministry, I think...

05:17.192 --> 05:19.879
- Well, not that many
children attend here.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.881
- And that's all right,
but that's my point.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.907
See, maybe if we did things
a little differently...

05:25.451 --> 05:28.454
What color would
your father choose?

05:30.998 --> 05:31.999
- I don't know.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.896
- Probably white.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.883
- All those in favor of
the room remaining white.

05:42.051 --> 05:44.219
Opposed, by the same sign?

05:46.722 --> 05:50.392
Motion carries, white
the walls shall remain.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.497
- It would make
things a lot easier

05:54.521 --> 05:57.042
if you'd stop changing things.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.793
- I haven't changed anything.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.029
- And let's keep it
that way, shall we?

06:03.072 --> 06:05.675
- No one questions
your heart, John,

06:05.699 --> 06:08.702
it's just your methods
no one likes.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.924
You know, you
should really learn

06:45.948 --> 06:47.449
how to do this yourself.

06:48.969 --> 06:50.769
It feels kinda weird
putting makeup on myself.

06:50.793 --> 06:52.180
Try putting it on your dad.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.390
- Daddy, when are you
going to read to me?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.309
- Aw sweetheart, I'm sorry.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.103
I have to get to the hospital.

06:58.127 --> 07:00.447
A bunch of little kids are waiting
for their favorite clown.

07:00.471 --> 07:01.606
- But it's Pie Piper.

07:01.630 --> 07:02.965
- Jack here can read it to you.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.819
No, I have rehearsal tonight.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.195
- All right, tomorrow.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.013
You, me, Mommy, Jack, we'll
read it together as as family.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.702
- Yeah, seriously, family's
more important, right?

07:14.726 --> 07:16.121
- I guess.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.914
- Mm-hmm.

07:17.938 --> 07:18.915
- Great.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.400
Now, where did I
leave that nose?

07:24.278 --> 07:27.006
Let me have it.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.216
Yeah, I'll put it on later.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.658
- Might wanna clean it.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.518
Someone's comin' to see you.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.542
Told ya.

07:40.544 --> 07:43.940
- Let's see your muscles, err.
- Err.

07:43.964 --> 07:44.964
- Errr.

07:45.716 --> 07:46.716
Good job.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.865
- Night has come.

07:51.889 --> 07:55.451
In the dusk they grope their
way to find your ear.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.645
- But my words find
no such impediment.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.125
Small wonder, that,

08:02.149 --> 08:05.128
for within my heart
they find their home.

08:05.152 --> 08:09.465
How large my heart and
how small your ear.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.219
My words must mount,
and that takes time.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.181
- In truth, I seem to speak
from distant heights.

08:16.205 --> 08:19.726
- True, far above, that such
a height would mean death

08:19.750 --> 08:22.312
if a hard word from
you fell on my heart.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.980
- Well, I will come down.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.398
- No.
- Then climb.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.422
- No.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.241
- To be half hidden,
half revealed.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.018
Do you know what
this means to me?

08:42.272 --> 08:45.501
- Jack, well done,
and Holly, you too.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.696
Keep practicing at home, and
we will see you opening night!

08:54.159 --> 08:56.078
- No, I got a ride.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.765
- I got my permit.

08:58.789 --> 09:02.000
- Well that's not
gonna get you places.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.192
My lady.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.217
- Gentlemen.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.364
You were terrific today, Jack.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.075
- Thanks, you too.
- Thanks.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.201
- Boom!

09:18.225 --> 09:20.995
And the crowd goes wild!

09:21.019 --> 09:23.039
- Dirk, you stink.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.063
Stop.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.461
- Ready.
- Good.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.070
Woah, who is that?

09:35.158 --> 09:38.471
What kinda preacher is he, huh?

09:38.495 --> 09:40.473
Hey, maybe we could
all go with you.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.392
How many can fit in a
clown car anyway, huh?

09:42.416 --> 09:43.559
- Bye, Jack.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.812
- Hey kids.
- See ya, Jack.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.213
- Well, that explains a lot.

09:55.281 --> 09:56.281
- Are you guys...
- No.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.199
- You know, kinda like...
- No.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.118
Sure you don't wanna
ask her to dinner?

10:00.142 --> 10:01.222
Your Mom's cooking tonight.

10:01.246 --> 10:03.288
No Dad, she had a
boyfriend, okay?

10:03.312 --> 10:04.438
- Use your blinker.
- I know.

10:05.753 --> 10:06.833
Stop the windshield wipers.

10:06.857 --> 10:07.834
- Yes.
- Please.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.127
Okay.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.446
- You're embarrassing me
in front of the kids.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.092
Hey.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.552
- Hey.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.387
- Kids are sleeping.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.411
- Nice.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.310
- I have a new vision
for the church.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.269
- Fantastic.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.087
- I'm talking
territory expanding.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.987
- By changing the
Christmas pageant.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.573
Okay.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.241
- No, no, no, I'm serious.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.265
I mean, this year I really
wanna show the community

10:42.289 --> 10:43.411
how much God loves them,

10:43.435 --> 10:46.247
but I wanna do it in
like a huge, ginormous,

10:46.271 --> 10:48.082
mesmerizing spectacle.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.524
You know, big time!

10:51.193 --> 10:53.713
Babe, with your creative genius,

10:53.737 --> 10:54.737
and with my,

10:56.114 --> 10:58.176
with your creative genius,

10:58.200 --> 10:59.886
we could totally sell this.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.220
I mean, it's gonna be awesome.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.890
Think about it,
just, envision it.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.290
Christmas Pageant.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.273
- Okay, okay wait,
I have an idea

11:12.297 --> 11:15.234
going beyond this.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.258
What if,

11:18.220 --> 11:19.220
we move?

11:22.432 --> 11:25.036
- First Church is looking
to hire a new pastor.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.829
- But, that's on the
other side of town.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.898
- Yes, it is, and I
got you an interview!

11:31.858 --> 11:35.171
- Surprise!
- Surprise, weehee, wait wait.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.435
What do you mean, you did this?

11:36.459 --> 11:37.673
Why?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.301
- Because, honey, we're
called here to serve

11:40.325 --> 11:42.929
and if the board won't
let you do it here,

11:42.953 --> 11:45.932
then maybe God has somewhere
else that you can go.

11:45.956 --> 11:49.102
- Sweetheart, I can't
just leave the church.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.478
My calling is here.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.502
- Just,

11:53.004 --> 11:55.298
just go talk to them, okay?

11:56.508 --> 11:59.261
For me, your creative
genius wife.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.411
- All right, I'll tell ya what,

12:06.435 --> 12:08.186
I'll do the interview,

12:09.479 --> 12:11.189
you do the pageant.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.919
- You'll do your best
at the interview.

12:14.943 --> 12:15.943
- Of course.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.881
- Deal.
- Nice.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.969
- All right, preacher man.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.554
Hmm, what do you think?

12:24.578 --> 12:26.764
- It's nice, it's...

12:26.788 --> 12:28.182
What is it?

12:28.206 --> 12:30.959
♪ Let every heart

12:33.295 --> 12:36.131
♪ Prepare him room

12:39.759 --> 12:43.138
♪ And heaven and heaven

12:46.892 --> 12:49.644
♪ And nature sing

12:59.404 --> 13:02.550
- The angel of the
Lord appeared to them,

13:02.574 --> 13:07.013
and the glory of the
Lord shone around them.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.749
But the angel said to
them, do not be afraid.

13:17.547 --> 13:21.468
The angel of the Lord said
to them, do not be afraid.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.308
- That's your cue.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.022
- Ooh.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.818
She had a little accident.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.240
- Well, get a towel.

13:44.407 --> 13:47.553
Somebody get me another angel.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.828
- Hello!

13:55.627 --> 13:59.357
- Well, Pastor, what
brings you here?

13:59.381 --> 14:03.301
- These are the scripts to
the new Christmas pageant.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.558
- Mary, we have to go
in a new direction.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.712
- You have got to be joking.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.756
This is rubbish.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.508
- I disagree.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.843
I actually think
it's quite good.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.679
- Well I'm not doing this.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.889
Neither is the choir.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.057
- Okay, look Mary...

14:33.081 --> 14:35.393
- No, no, no, you look, Mister.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.812
You've gone too far this time.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.398
Your father would
be so disappointed.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.608
It would break his
heart if he could see

14:42.632 --> 14:46.028
what you're doing to his church.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.197
You want change?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.598
You want change?

14:50.682 --> 14:53.160
Oh, I'll bring you
change, Mister.

14:53.184 --> 14:56.646
- Mary, please, let's
just talk about this.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.149
Maybe later?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.708
- Let's open up our
hymnals to 723,

15:40.732 --> 15:44.027
Shall We Gather At
The River, acapella.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.613
One voice,

15:49.532 --> 15:50.575
united.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.641
Thank you for coming today.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.310
- Yes, thank you so much.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.896
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.397
- Thank you for...

16:03.421 --> 16:06.233
- Have a good one, thank you.
- Thank you.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.194
Sorry about the choir.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.528
We'll get them back real soon.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.739
- I have no idea.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.741
- Hi there, thank
you for coming.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.285
Bye bye, thank you.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.828
- John.
- Hey, Chuck.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.896
- We need to have a talk.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.834
- Listen Chuck, this whole
mess with the choir,

16:23.858 --> 16:26.087
I promise I can clear this up.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.922
- Well you better do it quick.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.591
Mary has called for an
emergency board meeting.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.702
She's moving to replace
you as pastor.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.014
- The board meets in two weeks.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.265
- Two weeks.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.643
- The church is rather
fond of the choir,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.645
and so is the board.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.480
- I like the choir too, Chuck.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.817
- Good, you have two weeks
to get the choir back.

16:47.841 --> 16:52.095
I wish you the best, but I'm
late for the cafeteria.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.492
Cafeteria.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.077
I'm getting fired.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.101
- Deceit.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.811
Compromise.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.541
Prejudice.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.650
Cowardice, stupidity.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.277
- Cyrano!

17:10.155 --> 17:12.574
- You have taken everything.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.704
But there is still
one treasure I keep:

17:18.579 --> 17:19.580
my pride.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.467
- You have lost your mind.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.073
- I have to straighten
this thing out.

18:15.097 --> 18:17.725
- She's not gonna talk to you.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.725
- I think you're wrong.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.649
Mary.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.070
Mary, Mary Margaret.

18:41.079 --> 18:44.809
I know it's late, but
we have to talk.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.686
- You have really hit the
bottom of the gutter.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.814
Dragging your family
to my doorstep

18:49.838 --> 18:51.398
to beg for your job?

18:51.422 --> 18:52.733
- It's not like that.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.152
- Well I don't need
you, John Bridges,

18:55.176 --> 18:57.822
and I don't need
your family, either.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.157
- You don't mean that, Mary.
- Go away.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.661
- Oh come on, Mary
Margaret, please...

19:01.685 --> 19:05.606
Go away!

19:42.265 --> 19:44.743
Kinda tryin' to think here.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.927
- Honey, just let Mary Margaret
do the pageant her way.

19:46.951 --> 19:48.831
You don't have to use my ideas.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.175
- Well, it's not just about the
pageant though, sweetheart.

19:51.199 --> 19:54.545
I mean, I really wanna take
this church in a new direction.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.754
It's 35 miles an hour here.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.715
- Dad, come on, I've got this.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.059
- Well then, you
know you're gonna

19:59.083 --> 20:00.960
have to convince her of that.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.012
She's not talking to me.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.621
She's not even listening.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.600
- Slow down.

20:07.624 --> 20:10.376
- Why won't she
lis, slowing down.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.857
- Look, Mary Margaret
doesn't talk to anyone

20:14.881 --> 20:17.693
that's outside of
her generation.

20:17.717 --> 20:21.888
Maybe if I was like 80 years
old, she would listen to me.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.798
- I need you to
make me look old.

20:28.822 --> 20:31.165
- You don't need
my help for that.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.083
- I need you to make me
look really old, okay?

20:33.107 --> 20:34.752
Like way, way older.

20:34.776 --> 20:39.465
I'm gonna bring this choir
back, like the Pie Piper,

20:39.489 --> 20:41.926
a really old Pie Piper.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.093
- Pie Piper!

20:43.117 --> 20:44.827

21:21.155 --> 21:22.883
Well just tell me
everything I need to know.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.385

21:24.409 --> 21:25.803
- Then show me.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.346
Do you have a mask?

21:27.370 --> 21:28.097
- Yeah.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.849
Put it on.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.977
We're gonna have ourselves

your character

22:39.484 --> 22:41.378
is something that happens
from the inside,

22:41.402 --> 22:43.422
all right, it has to
happen from the inside.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.923
- What does that mean, I
have to walk a certain way?

22:44.947 --> 22:46.387
- Well, not just
that, you have to...

22:46.411 --> 22:48.093
It was a joke, Holly, come on.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.054
- I don't care, just
stay away from me.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.972

- Let go of me.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.015
Dirk, that was too far.

watch your mouth, Holly.

Hey.

23:05.927 --> 23:06.987
- Let me go.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.280

I'm so sorry.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.288
Dirk, you really are
a piece of work.

23:12.312 --> 23:14.606

wishes you to go.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.673

you're sticking your face

23:26.697 --> 23:27.966

pure silver.

Hair like mine is both
mantle and crown,

24:04.318 --> 24:07.113
a, a monument to my superiority.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.802
Silver hair is the
banner of a great man,

a generous heart, a
towering spirit,

24:14.912 --> 24:18.457
an expansive soul such
as I unmistakably am,

24:19.667 --> 24:22.712
and such as you dare
not dream to be.

24:25.006 --> 24:29.653
With your head lacking in
wisdom, lacking in sense,

24:29.677 --> 24:32.513
in wit, in cunning,
in imagination,

24:34.098 --> 24:38.078
lacking in intellect, just
like that other round mass

24:38.102 --> 24:41.105
at the opposite end of
your crimson spine.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.274
- That's it!

24:45.443 --> 24:46.443
Oh!

24:54.202 --> 24:58.206
- Go home, lad, before
you embarrass yourself.

25:01.834 --> 25:02.834

25:19.185 --> 25:21.622
You didn't have to do that.

- Thank you.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.275
- I'm really fine.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.819
- I have never seen
anything like that.

this without you.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.150

happened to me at the mall.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.422

taken with Santa?

27:35.446 --> 27:36.715
- No, no.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.051
Some old guy went
all Cyrano on Dirk,

27:39.075 --> 27:42.370
totally humiliated him in the
middle of the foot court.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.848
Some guy looked like Cyrano?

27:44.872 --> 27:47.601
- No, no, no, no, I mean,
this guy was Cyrano.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.770
He's coming over for a
Christmas party tonight.

27:49.794 --> 27:50.836
You should come.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.675
- Yeah, when he did
Cyrano, I thought of you.

27:58.386 --> 28:02.366
- Holly, that'd be great
but I, I got homework.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.159
- Oh, okay.

28:04.183 --> 28:08.187

28:09.313 --> 28:11.792

- Milo.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.308
- Whatever.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.542
Oh, come here.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.697
Here's the starters, Frank.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.806
I picked them out myself.

29:27.308 --> 29:28.326
Here's a plate.

29:28.350 --> 29:31.079
- Thank you, Ms. Coolidge.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.103
- Oh,

29:32.897 --> 29:34.315
call me Babs.

29:37.443 --> 29:41.173
Hello everyone, Merry Christmas.

29:41.197 --> 29:44.468
Hello, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.429
- Hello Chuck, merry
Christmas, good to see you.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.556
Good to see you.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.373
Oh, everything just...

29:54.877 --> 29:56.438
Do I know you?

29:56.462 --> 30:00.859
Milo McGilicuddy.

30:00.883 --> 30:02.194
Nice to meet ya.

30:02.218 --> 30:05.280
- It's just so unusual
to see a new face

30:05.304 --> 30:07.431
at one of Barbara's parties.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.289
- Frank and I met Barbara
back at the mall.

30:14.313 --> 30:18.484
- Oh yes, she, she did tell
me about her new friend.

30:19.443 --> 30:22.047
- Frank, Frank, come back!

30:22.071 --> 30:23.071
Oh!

30:26.158 --> 30:27.469
- Oh, what a mess.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.512
Oh, Barbara.

30:28.536 --> 30:31.097
- Oh no!
- Sorry, sorry.

30:31.121 --> 30:34.976
I'll just...
- Oh, look how strong you are.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.478
- It's my fault, sorry.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.355
- No, it's nobody's fault.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.941
Oh, dinner's ready,
it's time to eat.

30:40.965 --> 30:42.049
Holly, honey!

30:42.925 --> 30:43.925
Time to eat!

30:45.427 --> 30:47.721
- Wow, hi, merry Christmas.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.434
It's so good to see you guys.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.269
Mr. Frank!

31:17.293 --> 31:18.294
You made it!

31:20.796 --> 31:22.899
- Great googly moogly.

31:22.923 --> 31:26.236
Are you sure you're okay?

31:26.260 --> 31:27.886
Oh, it's time to eat.

31:32.474 --> 31:37.205
- So, who's the lucky guy that
gets to play Cyrano with you?

31:37.229 --> 31:40.834
- Jack Bridges plays
Cyrano, he's really good.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.235
I would love for
you to meet him.

31:45.446 --> 31:47.406
- Yeah, he's sweet.
- Oh.

31:48.699 --> 31:51.803
Sweet like a good friend,
or sweet like maybe

31:51.827 --> 31:55.015
something more than a friend?

31:55.039 --> 31:56.832
- Leave my baby alone.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.563
So Frank, tell us
about yourself.

32:01.587 --> 32:05.609
- Well, let's see, I'm
a poet, a playwright,

32:05.633 --> 32:08.486
a scientist, a bit
of a musician too.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.512
Oh, and a sword master.

32:12.514 --> 32:15.243
- You really are Cyrano.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.561
- Yeah, I have modeled
my life after his.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.945
- What about you, Mr.
McGilicuddy?

32:30.324 --> 32:33.511
- After serving in
the Navy, Milo here

32:33.535 --> 32:35.496
moved to Japan.

32:36.664 --> 32:39.208
- And became a
master Hibachi chef.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.547
- Why, he studied under Benny
Ho for nearly 20 years.

32:46.674 --> 32:49.235
I saw Benny Ho on television.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.570
- I know.

32:50.594 --> 32:54.032
Okay, enough about me.

32:54.056 --> 32:56.242
Now, do you all go to church?

32:56.266 --> 32:58.536
- Yes, Grace United.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.956
- Well I hear you all
have a great pastor.

33:01.980 --> 33:06.151
Oh, who told you that?

33:09.822 --> 33:11.716
- I can't remember.

33:11.740 --> 33:16.137
- Well, actually, we did
have a fine pastor once.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.515
We served together for 30 years.

33:18.539 --> 33:21.417
He preached, and
I led the music.

33:22.710 --> 33:27.273
- Pastor Bridges' wife, Ruth,
passed in '98 from cancer,

33:27.297 --> 33:30.735
and then Mary Margaret
and Pastor Johnathan

33:30.759 --> 33:32.386
married a year later.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.055
- Sounds scandalous.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.159
- Nothing could be
further from the truth.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.537
Seems a little soon
to marry a guy

33:40.561 --> 33:44.582
right after he just buried
his wife, don't you think?

33:44.606 --> 33:46.692
- Well, his son thought so.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.450
- Chuck, tell us
how you're doing.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.704
- My cataracts are acting up.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.709
- Aww, well, we walk by
faith and not by sight.

34:05.586 --> 34:08.338
Judith, pass Chuck the carrots.

Thank you for coming!

34:34.864 --> 34:37.342
- I can't believe we spent
the entire night there,

34:37.367 --> 34:39.596
and you didn't say one
thing about the choir.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.098
- Look, they're not gonna
listen to us yet, okay?

34:42.121 --> 34:43.016
You know?

34:43.040 --> 34:44.768
We've gotta be closer to them.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.351
I can't grow closer to Barbara

34:46.376 --> 34:47.771
without a wedding license.

34:47.795 --> 34:49.313
- Shh!

34:49.338 --> 34:50.440
Relax, all right?

34:50.464 --> 34:53.067
I need more time, that's all.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.091
Trust me.

34:55.385 --> 34:56.612
Okay.

34:56.637 --> 35:00.599
(Instrumental rock version
of "Jingle Bells")

35:08.190 --> 35:10.835
- And swim, and swim.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.170
There you go, everyone!

35:12.194 --> 35:13.505
I'm so proud of you.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.674
Keep moving, keep going,
keep moving those arms.

35:16.698 --> 35:17.698
Faster.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.900
And swim, and swim.

35:33.924 --> 35:37.761
Spread out everyone, make
sure you've got room.

36:00.951 --> 36:01.951
- Whoo!

36:03.662 --> 36:05.056
Out.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.224
In.

36:06.248 --> 36:07.248
Out.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.168
- I-17.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.691
I-21.

36:40.009 --> 36:41.009
- Ooh!

36:41.033 --> 36:42.033
Bingo.

36:45.871 --> 36:49.475
- So it appears that all
of Abraham's descendents

36:49.499 --> 36:52.020
aren't just the Jews,
but actually those

36:52.044 --> 36:53.688
that will come to Christ.

36:53.712 --> 36:54.939
- Good point.

36:54.963 --> 36:58.526
Would you like to elaborate
further on that?

36:58.550 --> 37:00.260
- No, you're teaching.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.742
I don't get it.

37:05.766 --> 37:08.661
She's being so
pleasant right now.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.020
What sets her off?

37:11.939 --> 37:16.693
- My mother always said,
hurt people hurt people.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.727
- This isn't gonna be
a typical interview.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.396
We move fast here
at First Church.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.565
Sounds good to me.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.989
- You're gonna love
it here, Pastor.

37:39.013 --> 37:40.360
The staff, the
people, the tools.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.946
We got HD projectors,
HD cameras,

37:42.970 --> 37:44.280
state of the art audio system.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.782
You name it, we've got it,

37:45.806 --> 37:47.246
and you can have
your own TV ministry

37:47.270 --> 37:49.077
up and running with
the flip of a switch.

37:49.101 --> 37:50.870
- Well, actually I don't
have a TV ministry.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.872
- Not yet, you don't,
but you will here.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.500
We've got everything you
need to reach our community

37:55.524 --> 37:56.793
and the whole world.

37:56.817 --> 37:59.212
- Well, that's impressive.

37:59.236 --> 38:01.005
I bet you have live
donkeys here too.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.423
Um, sorry?

38:02.447 --> 38:04.647
- The Christmas Pageant, I'm
sure you have live animals.

38:04.671 --> 38:06.631
- Oh yeah, yeah, of course,
donkeys, sheep, camel.

38:06.655 --> 38:09.353
One of our wise men actually
rides in on an elephant.

38:10.891 --> 38:11.891
- Oh no, sir.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.644
I wouldn't joke with
you about that.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.688
- I don't even know what to say.

38:16.712 --> 38:18.922
- Say yes to First Church.

39:00.380 --> 39:01.380
John.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.693
John.

39:03.717 --> 39:05.052
John, you okay?

39:06.887 --> 39:08.930
- Yeah, I'm fine, but,

39:10.182 --> 39:13.911
I'm leaving behind
more than just a job.

39:13.935 --> 39:16.205
- You know, I
completely understand.

39:16.229 --> 39:19.917
Your father was a great
man, and a great pastor,

39:19.941 --> 39:22.754
and I see him in
you, I really do.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.131
And so does the
search committee.

39:25.155 --> 39:28.760
And John, that's why we want
you here at First Church.

39:28.784 --> 39:30.595
The job is yours if you want it.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.972
You guys do move fast.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.099
- Don't let tradition
hold you back.

39:35.123 --> 39:38.978
Come blaze a new trail with
us here at First Church.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.855
- Well done, people, well done!

39:40.879 --> 39:43.775
Let's reset for next week.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.985
- So, Uncle Frank is
coming over tonight.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.612
- Oh, the real Cyrano.

39:47.636 --> 39:48.821
- Yeah, yeah.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.281
The real Cyrano.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.075
And Mr. McGilicuddy.

39:52.099 --> 39:55.912
They are hitting the town with
my mom and Mary Margaret.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.163
- Party.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.123
- Yeah, well my mom
is real excited.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.942
- Oh boy.

40:06.655 --> 40:07.948
I got homework.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.802
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:10.826 --> 40:15.014
Still got that big
project, you know, yeah.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.516
What are you doing?

40:16.540 --> 40:19.435
- I don't know, I was
thinking you could

40:19.459 --> 40:21.437
come meet Cyrano.

40:21.461 --> 40:24.756
Afterwards, you and I could
do something together.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.193
- If you wanted to.

40:27.217 --> 40:29.403
- I do, but, but I can't.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.804
Next time, okay?

40:32.639 --> 40:34.516
- I promise.

40:35.392 --> 40:36.392
- Okay.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.126
- Barbara, I feel like a fool.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.335
I'm going home.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.795
- Nonsense, it'll be wonderful.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.571
Let's go find a group.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.868
- You've got to be kidding.

40:54.077 --> 40:58.081

drowned out by music)

42:19.287 --> 42:20.622
- Frank, Frank!

42:25.710 --> 42:27.063

42:27.087 --> 42:28.898
I got this next song.

42:28.922 --> 42:29.965
- Well, okay.

42:31.258 --> 42:33.945

Frank's gonna teach you

42:33.969 --> 42:35.845
a little somethin' new.

44:38.426 --> 44:39.278
- Oh, please.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.471
I haven't danced in years.

44:42.389 --> 44:44.641
I didn't even want to come.

44:45.517 --> 44:47.244
- I'm glad you did.

44:47.268 --> 44:51.147

me to some such thing.

whole choir boycott thing.

- I find it kinda odd that
you'd quit the church

45:06.454 --> 45:08.849
when you've got a pageant
right around the corner.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.726
- Oh, indeed.

45:10.750 --> 45:14.772
It is my most favorite
church service of the year.

45:14.796 --> 45:18.025
But, the pastor wanted to
do something different,

45:18.049 --> 45:20.718
so he's let his
wife ruin things.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.156
I ran that pageant for 40 years,

45:24.180 --> 45:28.119
never heard one word
of complaint, not one.

45:28.143 --> 45:29.912
- Imagine that.

45:29.936 --> 45:31.872
- Today's generation
just isn't interested

45:31.896 --> 45:36.067
in the things of the past,
our history, our heritage.

45:38.153 --> 45:40.131
- Well maybe you
should pass the baton.

45:40.155 --> 45:44.510
- Oh, they are not ready
for such responsibility.

45:44.534 --> 45:46.929
- Maybe we should
get them ready.

45:46.953 --> 45:49.432
You know, guide
them, direct them.

45:49.456 --> 45:54.019
It's not like we're gonna
be around forever.

45:54.043 --> 45:57.481
Maybe we should
have a new pageant.

45:57.505 --> 46:00.425
- Maybe we should
have a new pastor.

46:02.051 --> 46:03.051
- Maybe.

46:05.472 --> 46:08.266
It's messed up,
what he did to you.

46:12.437 --> 46:16.357
But you shouldn't hate
the church for it.

46:19.486 --> 46:22.923
Mr. McGilicuddy, I
had two husbands,

46:22.947 --> 46:25.325
both taken from me by death.

46:26.493 --> 46:27.911
I have no children.

46:29.537 --> 46:32.165
My siblings have
all passed away.

46:33.500 --> 46:36.711
Oh I assure you, I
don't hate the church.

46:38.671 --> 46:39.839
The church is,

46:41.466 --> 46:42.466
all I have.

46:44.594 --> 46:47.865
And I will fight with
everything that I am

46:47.889 --> 46:51.476
to see that it carries
on as God intended.

46:58.399 --> 47:00.318
- You're a strong woman.

47:02.529 --> 47:05.466
I can see why they
all follow you.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.635
- You are too kind.

47:07.659 --> 47:10.453
- I know it's not my place, but,

47:11.788 --> 47:14.558
maybe you should call this
whole boycott thing off.

47:14.582 --> 47:17.520
You know, let the choir
do what they love to do.

47:17.544 --> 47:19.146
For the church's sake.

47:19.170 --> 47:22.066
I for one would rather see
you using your talents

47:22.090 --> 47:25.885
and your influence in a
more positive fashion.

47:27.387 --> 47:28.638
- You're right.

47:30.431 --> 47:32.725
It's not your place to say.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.956
I'll call off the boycott.

47:36.980 --> 47:40.584
The choir may return,
if they wish.

47:40.608 --> 47:44.505
- That is the most selfless
thing yet, Mary Margaret!

47:44.529 --> 47:49.468
- But I can't go back, not as
long as that pastor is there.

47:49.492 --> 47:52.096
- He doesn't want the
choir back without you.

47:52.120 --> 47:55.724
- How would you
know what he wants?

47:55.748 --> 47:57.810
- It just seems like
you two are closer

47:57.834 --> 47:59.937
than you may think.

47:59.961 --> 48:02.001
I mean, really, you both
want the same thing, right?

48:02.025 --> 48:04.149
What's best for the church.

48:04.173 --> 48:06.735
Maybe you can work
somethin' out,

48:06.759 --> 48:08.720
find some middle ground.

48:10.471 --> 48:14.618
- Oh, I'll deal with the pastor
at the next board meeting.

48:14.642 --> 48:17.729
Until then, his wife
can run the choir.

48:23.443 --> 48:27.572
- Hey babe, have you heard
from First Church yet?

48:29.616 --> 48:31.010
I was thinking about this summer

48:31.034 --> 48:33.220
and thinking that it might
really be the perfect time

48:33.244 --> 48:37.123
to move the kids, out of
school and everything.

48:40.585 --> 48:44.756
Have you thought of a name for
your television show, babe?

48:47.342 --> 48:51.679
Do you think the kids would get
a chance to be on the show?

48:57.143 --> 48:59.270
What an answer to prayer.

49:08.696 --> 49:11.717
I said, what an
answer to prayer.

49:11.741 --> 49:12.950
- I heard you.

49:15.703 --> 49:16.703
- Nothing.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.627
- You turned down the
job, didn't you?

49:23.396 --> 49:24.396
How did you get that?

49:24.420 --> 49:25.505
From that? - John!

49:27.924 --> 49:29.151
- Yes.

49:29.175 --> 49:30.775
- And they're probably
going to fire you.

49:30.799 --> 49:34.365
- No, no, I brought
the choir back.

49:34.389 --> 49:35.909
- Well I thought we
could just get away

49:35.933 --> 49:37.117
from all these problems.

49:37.141 --> 49:40.120
- Well, First Church has
problems too, right?

49:40.144 --> 49:42.247
- It was just a big opportunity.

49:42.271 --> 49:44.875
- Well, maybe our
opportunity is here.

49:44.899 --> 49:47.711
Seriously, like, you know, maybe

49:47.735 --> 49:50.422
things are gonna
start to change.

49:50.446 --> 49:52.466
Maybe I'll figure out how
to work something out

49:52.490 --> 49:53.950
with Mary Margaret.

49:55.743 --> 49:56.743
Maybe,

49:58.037 --> 49:59.622
your darling husband

50:01.207 --> 50:05.211
is gonna lead this church
to be what it needs to be.

50:06.045 --> 50:07.981
- That's a lotta maybes.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.298
- Yeah, I know.

50:16.556 --> 50:17.556
Okay.

50:19.434 --> 50:20.476
Lead the way.

50:21.686 --> 50:22.687
- Come here.

50:32.530 --> 50:35.867
It's time for Frank and
Milo to say goodbye.

50:38.745 --> 50:40.747
- Sit down, gentlemen.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.642
We have business to attend to.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.185
- This will only take a second.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.295
- We don't have a second.

50:48.588 --> 50:51.758
I believe I've just
asked you to sit down.

50:55.344 --> 50:59.408
Yesterday, I received a call
from an acquaintance of mine

50:59.432 --> 51:00.725
at First Church.

51:02.018 --> 51:04.371
Pastor Bridges has
just been selected

51:04.395 --> 51:06.314
to be there new pastor.

51:09.108 --> 51:11.319
- It's not what you think.

51:12.487 --> 51:15.340
- He's been interviewing
with other churches?

51:15.364 --> 51:18.177
- Well, First Church
hasn't voted on it yet,

51:18.201 --> 51:20.554
but that's just a formality.

51:20.578 --> 51:23.390
Maybe we don't have
all the facts right.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.684
I mean, maybe he's
turned them down.

51:25.708 --> 51:29.670
- He wouldn't interview if
he didn't want to leave.

51:34.175 --> 51:36.260
- Maybe he's just stupid.

51:37.929 --> 51:40.616
- Maybe his wife
put him up to it.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.159
- We need a true leader.

51:42.183 --> 51:46.079
- One that values our
church history too.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.665
- It's time for us to act.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.709
Now I've done some research,

51:50.733 --> 51:54.880
and here is the man I think
should be our next pastor.

51:54.904 --> 51:56.489
Pass these around.

51:57.782 --> 52:01.553
He's wonderful, his
background impeccable,

52:01.577 --> 52:04.914
solid schooling, 30
plus years experience.

52:05.915 --> 52:08.519
His name is Norm Steedy.

52:08.543 --> 52:11.772
- He reminds me of
Pastor Johnathan.

52:11.796 --> 52:13.506
- Yeah, doesn't he.

52:17.718 --> 52:20.197
- I don't see the resemblance.

52:20.221 --> 52:24.284
- He retired two years ago
to care for his ailing wife

52:24.308 --> 52:28.163
who has since passed
away, and now he wishes

52:28.187 --> 52:30.356
to return to the ministry.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.753
- Oh, we have the votes.

52:34.777 --> 52:37.714
If anyone does not
like our decision,

52:37.738 --> 52:41.617
well, they can just go
form their own church.

52:43.786 --> 52:46.807
When do we get to meet the guy?

52:46.831 --> 52:49.643
- I'm going to set
up a dinner meeting

52:49.667 --> 52:53.647
where we can all spend
some time with Mr. Steedy

52:53.671 --> 52:56.191
to be certain that he is the man

52:56.215 --> 53:00.344
that we indeed want to take
over for Pastor Bridges.

53:01.345 --> 53:02.865
- I need more time to fix this.

53:02.889 --> 53:04.199
- Forget it.

53:04.223 --> 53:05.583
I mean, after all
we've worked for,

53:05.607 --> 53:07.047
you go and interview
at First Church?

53:07.852 --> 53:11.707
- I will then take our
recommendation before the board.

53:11.731 --> 53:14.835
- If this Norm Steedy guy does
what they want him to do,

53:14.859 --> 53:16.295
the church is gonna die.

53:16.319 --> 53:17.546
- Not my problem.

53:17.570 --> 53:19.250
- Oh, wake up and smell
the heat bomb, son,

53:19.274 --> 53:20.883
of course it's your problem.

53:20.907 --> 53:22.593
Are there any other questions?

53:22.617 --> 53:26.787
How long has he been a widower?

53:32.251 --> 53:36.172
- Good, then I will see
you all Saturday night.

53:42.887 --> 53:45.014
- Guess what you're
doing Saturday?

53:46.557 --> 53:48.911
- You are coming
to dinner with me.

53:48.935 --> 53:50.621
- I am.

53:50.645 --> 53:51.955
I am?

53:51.979 --> 53:53.832
- Mom and I have been
invited to a dinner party

53:53.856 --> 53:56.293
and she said I could
bring a friend.

53:56.317 --> 53:57.860
- I can't.

53:59.362 --> 54:00.589
More homework?

54:00.613 --> 54:02.215
- Well, kind of.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.592
- I don't get it.

54:03.616 --> 54:04.968
Is there someone else?

54:04.992 --> 54:06.053
- No.

54:06.077 --> 54:08.013
- If you don't wanna
go out, just say so.

54:08.037 --> 54:09.664
- No, it's not that.

54:11.874 --> 54:12.917
- I...

54:15.544 --> 54:17.463
- I'll see you later.

54:23.427 --> 54:24.947
- Yes, this Saturday.

54:24.971 --> 54:27.908
- Oh, I thought you
meant next Saturday.

54:27.932 --> 54:29.892
Yeah, I'd love to go
with you this Saturday.

54:31.686 --> 54:32.686
- I can go.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.666
- I can't wait.

54:35.690 --> 54:36.941
- Yeah, me too.

54:38.150 --> 54:40.003
- Well, I gotta go.

54:40.027 --> 54:41.213
- All right.

54:41.237 --> 54:42.923
- Bye.

54:42.947 --> 54:43.947
- Bye.

54:50.037 --> 54:51.037
Ow.

54:52.415 --> 54:54.977
- Did Holly Coolidge
just ask you out?

54:55.001 --> 54:56.311
- Yeah.

54:56.335 --> 54:57.712
- Dude, awesome!

54:58.713 --> 55:00.423
- I can't go.

55:01.674 --> 55:04.152
Well, what are you gonna
do, stand her up?

55:04.176 --> 55:06.446
This is Holly Coolidge.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.031
What's wrong with you, man?

55:08.055 --> 55:09.616
- It's complicated.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.517
- Then uncomplicate it.

55:14.770 --> 55:15.770
- Nick,

55:16.939 --> 55:19.025
I'm gonna need your help.

55:25.531 --> 55:28.492
It's perfect, if I
do say so myself.

55:29.410 --> 55:30.804
- Epic!

55:30.828 --> 55:32.288
Wow dude, I am old!

55:33.372 --> 55:34.707
I'm really old.

55:35.666 --> 55:36.959
I feel old too.

55:37.918 --> 55:38.937
Who am I, again?

55:38.961 --> 55:41.857
This is never gonna work!

55:41.881 --> 55:44.443
- What, you said you needed
Frank, you got Frank.

55:44.467 --> 55:46.319
You're Frank, Frank Harmon.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.989
Okay, how do I play him?

55:49.013 --> 55:50.782
- Play him just like Cyrano.

55:50.806 --> 55:52.826
- Cyrano, Cyrano, got it.

55:52.850 --> 55:56.413
- And just follow Milo's
lead, and it will work.

55:56.437 --> 55:57.706
Nick can do this.

55:57.730 --> 55:59.249
- I got this, Mr. B.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.792
It's gonna be awesome.

56:00.816 --> 56:01.710
For real!

56:01.734 --> 56:03.336
Cyrano, like, runs in my veins.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.713
- And remember, you're old.

56:04.737 --> 56:06.131
So if you don't
know what to say,

56:06.155 --> 56:09.051
just pretend you can't hear
or fall asleep or something.

56:09.075 --> 56:09.968
- Got it.

56:09.992 --> 56:12.036
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.454
- Hi, Frank!

56:37.478 --> 56:39.331
- You're late.

56:39.355 --> 56:41.833
- Good evening, maidens.

56:41.857 --> 56:44.002
Oh how I've looked
forward to this night.

56:44.026 --> 56:47.696
I do not know which is more
full, the moon, or my heart.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.054
- I carry my
adornments on my soul.

56:54.078 --> 56:56.223
I do not dress up
as a puffin jay,

56:56.247 --> 56:59.434
but inwardly I keep
my daintiness.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.062
I do not bear with
me by any chance

57:02.086 --> 57:04.606
an insult not yet washed away,

57:04.630 --> 57:07.508
a conscience yellow
with unpurged bile...

57:10.427 --> 57:13.139
He's not himself
today, so sorry.

57:14.723 --> 57:16.076
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:16.100 --> 57:18.203
Holly, you look fantastic.

57:18.227 --> 57:19.227
- Thanks.

57:20.062 --> 57:21.730
This is Mr. McGilicuddy.

57:23.065 --> 57:24.692
- Had better days.

57:26.193 --> 57:29.381
- And this is the man I've been
telling you so much about.

57:29.405 --> 57:31.383
- Ah, the infamous Uncle Frank.

57:31.407 --> 57:32.950
- Charmed, I'm sure.

57:36.829 --> 57:40.350
- Oh, I told Holly she
could bring a friend.

57:40.374 --> 57:42.727
- Barbara, it's
hardly appropriate

57:42.751 --> 57:46.064
for the pastor's son to
be here, do you think?

57:46.088 --> 57:47.649
- Ohh.

57:47.673 --> 57:48.900
Oh, yeah.

57:48.924 --> 57:51.153
- Hostess, they'll
need their own table.

57:51.177 --> 57:52.529
- Let me see what I can do.

57:52.553 --> 57:53.822
- Thanks.

57:53.846 --> 57:56.032
- You kids run along,
take care of yourselves,

57:56.056 --> 57:57.808
and make good choices.

58:00.269 --> 58:02.539
- Oh, I'd be happy to
show you to the restroom.

58:02.563 --> 58:04.207
- I don't need to
use the restroom.

58:04.231 --> 58:06.042
- You need to use the restroom.

58:06.066 --> 58:09.212
I'll be right back,
save me a seat, okay?

58:09.236 --> 58:10.236
- Hurry back.

58:12.448 --> 58:14.718
- Okay, what are you
doing out there?

58:14.742 --> 58:16.303
- What, you told
me to be Cyrano.

58:16.327 --> 58:18.247
- Yeah, but you're pouring
it on a bit too thick,

58:18.271 --> 58:19.271
don't you think?

58:21.790 --> 58:23.083
- Here you are.

58:24.668 --> 58:25.668
- Thank you.

58:28.464 --> 58:30.049
- Well, hello there.

58:31.217 --> 58:32.819
- Excuse me.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.113
Do you have any more tables?

58:35.137 --> 58:37.908
- I'm sorry, this is
all we have right now.

58:37.932 --> 58:39.016
- Great.

58:41.060 --> 58:43.246
Turn it down, all right? - Okay.

58:43.270 --> 58:44.289
Okay.

58:44.313 --> 58:45.707
- Oh yeah.
- All right, good.

58:45.731 --> 58:47.542
Now get back out
there and be old.

58:47.566 --> 58:48.418
- You got it.

58:48.442 --> 58:50.212
- Jack Bridges.

58:50.236 --> 58:51.236
You.

58:56.200 --> 58:59.137
- Nighty night, old man.

58:59.161 --> 59:00.704
- Your table's ready.

59:09.755 --> 59:12.067
It's me, Jack, the situation's
been compromised.

59:12.091 --> 59:13.193
We have to go.

59:13.217 --> 59:14.927
- Not now, he's here.

59:16.762 --> 59:17.822
- Good evening.

59:17.846 --> 59:19.783
- Welcome, Reverend.

59:19.807 --> 59:21.100
- Good evening.

59:22.309 --> 59:24.704
- I'm so thankful for
this opportunity.

59:24.728 --> 59:27.332
And we are honored
to have you join us.

59:27.356 --> 59:28.565
- Hubba hubba.

59:31.443 --> 59:34.923
He's so young!

59:34.947 --> 59:37.259
- I did not know Johnathan
Bridges personally,

59:37.283 --> 59:39.135
but I knew of his work.

59:39.159 --> 59:42.222
Oh, what a legacy,
what a ministry.

59:42.246 --> 59:44.015
He had such an impact.

59:44.039 --> 59:46.935
It's a shame his son
did not fair better.

59:46.959 --> 59:49.896
I know you had great
expectations.

59:49.920 --> 59:54.091
- Huge expectations,
impossible expectations.

59:55.592 --> 59:58.738
At least, that's
what I gathered.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:02.158
- Well, it won't be easy
following in his footsteps.

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:06.329
- Well, if you're not up to
the challenge, I understand.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.123
- Mind your manners.

01:00:08.147 --> 01:00:10.065
You are out of place.

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.944
- I didn't say it would be easy,

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.531
but I still think I can do it.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:24.580
- Holly, we're soul mates.

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:27.142
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:28.101
- I want you.
- Please stop.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.269
- I have to go.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.294
- See ya.

01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:32.754
- Frank.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:38.427
- Milo, didn't you say that you
are a master Hibachi chef?

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.991
I...

01:00:43.015 --> 01:00:45.893
- Yes, he studied
under Benny Ho.

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:49.122
Well you must cook our dinner.

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.498
- Yes!

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:53.275
- It was along time ago,
I just, I couldn't.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:57.237
It would be a great honor.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800
- I cou...

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.719
- Milo, Milo, Milo, Milo!

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.847
Milo, Milo, Milo, Milo, Milo,

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.706
Milo, Milo, Milo, Milo.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:13.313
- Well, if you don't think
you're up for the challenge,

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:15.506
then I totally understand.

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.572
- Give me the knives.

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:23.764
- Oh ho ho ho!

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:29.978
Do you know how to
do the fryer thing?

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:34.066
- Oh, it's on.

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:37.921
Give me the hat, too.

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:39.923
- I asked you not to
touch me, very nicely.

01:01:39.947 --> 01:01:42.926
- If you were a phaser,
you'd be set on stunning.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.969
Okay, I need you.

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:47.663
- Hey, I think
you're in my seat.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.226
- I didn't see your name on it.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.293
- Sorry, Uncle Frank
ran into some trouble.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:56.713
Did Uncle Frank fall
and hit his face?

01:01:57.965 --> 01:01:59.401
- No, it's okay, he's fine.

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:01.569
- Do you wanna go for
a walk or something?

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.196
- That sounds lovely.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.406
Doesn't that sound nice?

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:05.670
We would love to go for a walk.

01:02:05.694 --> 01:02:08.159
- Hey, just get lost.

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.577
- Make me.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.871
You don't have it in
you, preacher boy.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.248
- I have a lot in me, Dirk.

01:02:13.272 --> 01:02:15.375
- Maybe I'll just have to
beat it out of you then.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:16.709
- Get on with it, so Holly and I

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.170
can finish our dinner together.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.779
- Dirk, don't you dare.

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:26.034
- If you want fight
at Big Panda Pagoda,

01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:30.181
you fight Big Panda.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:32.458
- He's Big Panda, in
case you were wondering.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.169
- Ow!

01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:39.357
- We gotta go, we gotta go.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:42.134
- Oh, Big Panda
show you the exit.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:45.822
- Thank you, Big Panda.

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:47.806
- Thank you for tickets.

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:51.578
- Yeah, Big Panda's a
fan of theater, so,

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.937
he's gonna be at our
show next week.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:52.495
Do it again!

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:04.901
- So we finally get
some time together.

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:05.925
- Yeah.

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:09.221
This first date has been crazy.

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:15.036
I gotta be honest with ya,

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.913
there's been some times
when we were together

01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:20.792
and I was pretending
to be somebody else.

01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:23.628
- You don't, you don't have
to do that with me, Jack.

01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:25.380
You can be yourself.

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:29.575
- No, I was actually trying
to be somebody else.

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:34.371
- Honestly, I really...

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:40.627
Wow, wow!

01:04:43.088 --> 01:04:44.088
- Jack.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.475
Milo, Milo, Milo!

01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:19.625
- Please, stop!

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.794
Just, cook the food.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.881
- I, I, I'm so sorry.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.506
- Excuse me.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.966
Where's Jack?

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.469
- Holly, sit down,
Milo's amazing.

01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:56.554
You've gotta see this.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:59.414
Sit down!

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.368
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:19.851
the flaming meteor.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.527
Drum roll please.

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:56.513
- That's too much fire.
- Oh no, Milo!

01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:03.037
Does anybody have a
fire extinguisher?

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:05.021
Somebody call 911!

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:16.949
Oh!

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:28.252
- Jack!

01:07:29.296 --> 01:07:32.150
- You were, you
were dating my mom?

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:34.801
- No, it's not like that,
it was never like that.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:39.097
- What do you mean,
how could you?

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.371
- Hey, listen, I
was just going...

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:48.583
- Spying on your own
church members,

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:50.192
and with your son.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:55.923
Well now that you
know what's going on,

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:58.742
it doesn't really
matter, does it?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.376
- Come on, Norm.

01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:47.850
- I knew something like
this was gonna happen.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:49.227
- It was your idea to make Milo

01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:51.103
into a Hibachi chef, remember?

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.939
Hey, I did everything you
told me to do, okay.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.483
I didn't act like
Milo, I became Milo,

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.843
I was Milo, I was transformed.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.738
- Was it my idea to
disguise ourselves?

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:03.363
Was it my idea to go
hang out with people

01:09:03.386 --> 01:09:04.908
50 years older than I am?

01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:07.745
Was it my idea to go chase
off this other pastor?

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:10.540
- Listen, I was
protecting the church.

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:14.417
- Protecting the church,
or your reputation?

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:16.254
- Maybe both.

01:09:16.278 --> 01:09:18.171
Listen, all I've
ever wanted to do

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.675
was to help this church
change and grow.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:24.786
- Maybe it's not the church
that needs to change.

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:32.126
- Wow.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:38.984
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't...

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:40.468
- No.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:50.312
You're right.

01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:57.903
You're right.

01:09:59.738 --> 01:10:00.864
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.830
- Let's just go home.

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:10.915
I'm hungry.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:16.832
- My oldest memories
of faith and family

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.275
are anchored in this church.

01:11:20.819 --> 01:11:23.339
As a boy, I used to sit
in that spot right there,

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:26.467
every Sunday morning
next to my mom.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:29.053
And you know, from that pew,

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:33.039
I saw God do some amazing
things in this church.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:37.937
I wanted to keep that
tradition alive.

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:40.964
I wanted to honor
our rich heritage.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:45.969
But something went wrong.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:54.477
It was pride,

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.815
and self-centeredness.

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:05.113
God tells us to love him, and
then to love each other.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.910
I failed to do that.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:29.804
Mary Margaret,

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:33.725
you made Dad so happy

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.164
at a time when that was
very difficult to do.

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:41.024
He loved you with all his heart,

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.943
and I'm truly sorry.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.073
As your pastor,

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.493
as your stepson,

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:58.792
I should have been more
loving and understanding.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:02.836
No, please,

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:06.548
forgive me.

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:31.282
Thank you for letting me be
your pastor all these years.

01:13:32.534 --> 01:13:33.993
God's will be done.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:46.339
Mary Margaret?

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.152
I know you're in there.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.261
Please, Mary?

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:04.941
Please let us in.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:14.784
Oh, Abby needs to pee.

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:23.001
- Down the hall
and to your left.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:35.597
Your father was
everything to me.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:39.184
- Mary Margaret, you are loved.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:51.487
And, you're family.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.597
- There's a card on top.

01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:01.932
Dad told us to make
it on the way over.

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:03.583
- Abby.
- Well he did.

01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:16.095
Dad said we should
call you Grammy.

01:15:49.963 --> 01:15:54.175
- There's that great picture
of you and Dad in it.

01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.514
- It's perfect.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:01.515
Thank you.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.027
- Thank you, for letting us in.

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:26.665
- Jack.

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.521
What are you doing here?

01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:32.273
- Sorry, but I haven't
seen you in a while

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.316
and we need to talk.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.883
- I've been busy.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:42.890
- Yeah, micro geography.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.455
- Listen, I just wanted
to say, I'm sorry.

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:52.692
I didn't mean to hurt
anybody, especially not you.

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:57.363
- How do I know
it's the real you?

01:16:58.573 --> 01:16:59.907
- It's me, look.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:12.813
If she ever wants to play
bingo or go dancing,

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:14.231
I can hook her up.

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.859
- I don't think that
will be necessary.

01:17:16.883 --> 01:17:19.528
Actually, I think she's
already moved on, so.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.262
- I hope you haven't.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.390
Merry Christmas.

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:27.185
Come on, just take it.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.887
- It comes with free
Hibachi lessons from Dad.

01:17:44.911 --> 01:17:49.224
- I'll bring my
fire extinguisher.

01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:50.809
Thanks.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.896
- Do you think we
can try this again?

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.380
No masks this time?

01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:00.194
'Cause if not, I can take the
panda back, it's no big deal.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:04.430
No, I think I'll keep it.

01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:28.764
I was wrong, John Bridges.

01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:33.000
I do need you and your family,
and so does this church.

01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:37.314
This study Bible
belonged to your father.

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:39.382
I want you to have it.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:44.470
Lead us well.

01:18:45.847 --> 01:18:47.432
All my love, Mary.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:13.666
Love is patient, love is kind.

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:20.673
It is not proud, nor
does it dishonor others.

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.219
It doesn't keep
record of wrongs.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.724
Love protects, trusts,

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.977
hopes, perseveres,

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:37.315
and it never, ever fails.

01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:44.280
If we loved more, what would
happen inside the church?

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:50.036
What would happen
outside the church?

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.397
- She wrapped him with
swaddling clothes

01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:03.192
and placed him in the manger.

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:07.029
That night, the shepherds
worked in the fields nearby

01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:09.198
and the angel of the
Lord appeared to them

01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:11.783
and the glory of the
Lord shone around them,

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.411
and they were
terribly frightened.

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:16.914
But the angel said unto them.

01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:20.525
- Do not be afraid, I
bring you good news.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:26.381
- Today, in the city of David,

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:28.884
a Savior has been born to you.

01:20:28.908 --> 01:20:31.327
He is the Messiah, the Lord.

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:36.099
- That's a cute baby!

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:37.893
Have you seen the baby?

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:38.917
So cute!

01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:43.965
(piano version of
"Silent Night")

01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:12.302
- Merry Christmas.

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:14.287
- Merry Christmas, Jack.
