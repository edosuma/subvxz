WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:04.170
I'm Tom Swift,
inventor, billionaire,

00:04.212 --> 00:06.464
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.633
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.260
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn

00:10.301 --> 00:12.095
I could earn his love.

00:12.137 --> 00:15.557
But his mission ended
tragically, or so I thought.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.059
Turns out it was sabotage.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.394
My father survived the attack

00:19.436 --> 00:21.229
and sent me a message capsule

00:21.271 --> 00:23.732
with the data I need
to rescue him from space.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.192
But it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.028
Now I have to find

00:28.069 --> 00:30.238
the pieces of that capsule
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.991
A global conspiracy called
The Road Back

00:33.033 --> 00:34.159
is standing in my way,

00:34.200 --> 00:35.827
so I can only trust my squad:

00:35.869 --> 00:38.580
My best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

00:38.621 --> 00:42.042
my adopted brother Lino,
and my AI Barclay.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.752
Together we're going
to find my father

00:43.793 --> 00:45.503
and bring him home.

We took the wrong turn,

01:10.695 --> 01:13.490

a chalk powder fun run,

You know, if you had only
waited for Barclay

02:50.962 --> 02:52.338

we could've tracked

Okay, we don't have time

02:55.717 --> 02:57.010
Barclay deactivated himself.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.596
In three days,
Earth will be at apogee.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.306
I can send an unmanned
rescue drone

03:01.347 --> 03:03.183
to Saturn to save my dad.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.727
We still have two pieces left
to find before we can assemble

03:05.768 --> 03:07.604
the full message capsule
to locate him.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.980
How are we going to do that

03:09.022 --> 03:10.315
without Barclay?

03:10.356 --> 03:11.983
I've tried jump-starting
Barclay's OS,

03:12.025 --> 03:12.984
but nothing's worked.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.402
The only person

03:14.444 --> 03:17.197
who might have answers...
is Rowan.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.034
You just want a reason
to look at his face again.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.327
No.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.786
You know what?

03:25.997 --> 03:29.042
(sighs)
Barclay, who am I?

03:29.626 --> 03:32.003
Barclay, are you shut
down because of Rowan?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.379
(drone chirps twice)

03:33.421 --> 03:35.173
Are you responding
to the name Rowan?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.216
(chirps twice)

03:36.257 --> 03:38.301
Rowan.
(chirps twice)

03:38.343 --> 03:41.346
I have tried texting--
you know who--

03:41.387 --> 03:43.514
and he's not even
ghosting me.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.641
He's gone full corpse.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.352
(laughing)
Okay, all right.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.728
Well, while
you're waiting for

03:48.770 --> 03:50.605
the Ghost of Kissmas Past
to hit you back,

03:50.647 --> 03:52.190
you should talk to Isaac

03:52.232 --> 03:56.444
about how you almost put
your mouth on his mouth.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.780
You've been
avoiding him all day.

03:59.906 --> 04:00.990
Oh.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.868
You're talking avoidance?

04:03.910 --> 04:06.871
Wasn't Congressman-
who-could-get-it Eskol

04:06.913 --> 04:08.623
blowing your phone up
all mission?

04:08.665 --> 04:09.749
Uh... no.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.292
Those text pings
blew our cover.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.127
Those were reminders,
and I stay on silent.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.964
(scoffs)
If you want us
to have a chance of

04:16.005 --> 04:17.340
getting those capsule pieces,

04:17.382 --> 04:19.759
figure things out
between you and Isaac.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.762
(phone buzzing)

04:25.974 --> 04:27.350
(mouths)

04:29.769 --> 04:31.104
Rowan...
(drone beeps twice)

04:32.021 --> 04:33.439
I have questions.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.316
ROWAN (over phone):
And I have answers.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.652
I'm at your front gate.
I need to speak with you.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.028
Alone.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.118
Let me put my Rowan uniform on.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.706
(groaning)

04:51.624 --> 04:54.585
TOM:
Why did your blood fix
the antidote that saved Isaac?

04:54.627 --> 04:57.547
And why were you there in 2019
when Isaac saved my dad?

04:57.588 --> 04:59.090
The Road Back injects
their operatives

04:59.132 --> 05:02.093
with a thallium antidote
to build a tolerance.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.263
And in 2019, I was
assigned to tail Barton.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.017
So you've been stalking
my family for years.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.686
Why did Barclay
shut down

05:11.728 --> 05:14.188
seconds after
I said your name?

05:14.230 --> 05:18.443
I will help you fix your AI
if you help me first.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.737
Are you familiar with
Andrita Lehman?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.280
The electromagnetics
pioneer?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.282
Yes.
She's brilliant.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.700
That's why
The Road Back

05:25.742 --> 05:27.618
plans to force her
to make a dangerous weapon.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.245
She's a target.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.583
TOM: We have
The Road Back's hit list

05:33.624 --> 05:36.210
and Andrita Lehman

05:36.252 --> 05:37.420
isn't on it.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.380
You think that's
the only list?

05:39.422 --> 05:43.801
The Road Back is targeting
hundreds of innovators.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.845
And Andrita, she's...

05:47.847 --> 05:49.223
She's my family.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.643
(inhales)

05:52.685 --> 05:55.480
So your family member
just happens to be

05:55.521 --> 05:57.815
a scientist targeted by
a deadly global conspiracy?

05:57.857 --> 06:00.902
I altered the intel on her
location to buy us time.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.362
Please.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.489
I have no resources to help her

06:04.530 --> 06:05.865
on my own.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.450
But you do, Tom.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.871
Why should I believe
anything that you say?

06:13.873 --> 06:16.250
What if I told you something
that could get me killed?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.424
When I found out
about Andrita,

06:23.466 --> 06:26.260
I also discovered that
the head of The Road Back...

06:27.261 --> 06:29.639
(sighs)
...is Susannah Robb.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.309
Our biggest investor,
Susannah Robb?

06:33.351 --> 06:35.186
(stammering):
What are you saying?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.688
I took these
in Eskol's office.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.941
Susannah's family
trust transferred

06:39.982 --> 06:41.609
tens of millions of dollars

06:41.651 --> 06:44.195
to Eskol's
congressional campaign.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.155
She basically
bought him that office.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.991
He owes her favors.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.831
And her idea of a favor
is a killing spree.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.876
She used Eskol's company
to attack my dad's ship.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.712
You once told me
I was on the wrong side.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.880
I agree.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.093
I'll help you fix Barclay
after you help me fix this.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.721
We have to get to Andrita

you said you altered Andrita's
info with The Road Back,

08:42.605 --> 08:44.857
right?
Yes, to give us a head start.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.359
Why?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.236
Andrita's keycard hasn't
been swiped at her lab

08:48.277 --> 08:49.737
in over a month.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.906
What?
TOM: And her car

08:53.866 --> 08:56.077

10:03.561 --> 10:05.813
To keep an eye
on the perimeter.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.192
Andrita...
business goals.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.611
Mm!

10:11.652 --> 10:13.988
When I get my life together
like she has hers,

10:14.030 --> 10:17.116
baby, it's over
for all of you.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.046
Door's open.
Get behind me.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.095
Oh, no.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.722
They were here already.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.481
Hey, stop right there!
(gasps)

10:50.107 --> 10:51.525
Tom Swift?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.070
TOM:
Yeah.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.655
Why the hell are you in my home?

10:55.696 --> 10:57.031
TOM: You're
in danger, girl.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.282
We thought
you were missing, and...

10:58.324 --> 11:01.118
(whispering): Shh.
I'm not missing.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.286
I'm on leave.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.455
Come. Come here.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.332

11:24.433 --> 11:26.102
Would you
stop organizing?

11:26.143 --> 11:27.436
I like it that way.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.979
(baby cooing)
I'm sorry.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.148
I-I just can't let
a woman on my vision board

11:31.190 --> 11:32.942
leave yesterday's sandwich
on her table.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.986
I have insider information
on The Road Back.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.863
I came to Tom
and his friends for help

11:37.905 --> 11:39.740
once I discovered
you were on their hit list.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.242
And who are you, exactly?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.329
You don't recognize him?

11:45.371 --> 11:48.082
We can deal
with that later.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.167
All of The Road Back's targets
are tech leaders

11:50.209 --> 11:51.335
at the top of their field,

11:51.377 --> 11:52.503
just like you.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.671
Your expertise

11:53.713 --> 11:55.256
in electromagnetism,
hovercrafts...

11:55.297 --> 11:57.675
We believe they want
to manipulate your science

11:57.717 --> 11:58.968
to create a weapon.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.136
A weapon?

12:00.177 --> 12:02.012
Even if this

12:02.054 --> 12:04.181
shadowy cabal wanted the
hovercrafts that I discussed,

12:04.223 --> 12:05.349
the metal alloy that's
needed for levitation...

12:05.391 --> 12:07.476
doesn't exist...
Doesn't exist yet.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.481
We're not playing you.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.859
ISAAC:
These people came after
Tom's father and made it

12:14.900 --> 12:17.528
look like an accident.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.029
Andrita, when will
your husband be home?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.156
My "husband" is
a half-empty tube

12:20.197 --> 12:21.574
in a freezer
near Seattle.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.783
TOM:
Okay.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.869
See, we stan a queen
who does it all.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.995
(laughs)

12:26.036 --> 12:28.372
Just about all.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.458
Hey, this chaos is
my biggest achievement.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.710
You'd be surprised
at what you can achieve

12:32.752 --> 12:34.545
when you let go of
what you thought "perfect"

12:34.587 --> 12:35.880
was gonna look like.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.506
I chose me

12:37.548 --> 12:39.925
instead of delaying my future.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.886
I also never have
to share takeout, so...

12:41.927 --> 12:43.387
(alarm beeping)

12:43.429 --> 12:45.139
I set up surveillance
around the perimeter

12:45.181 --> 12:46.348
of your property.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.017
The motion sensor
just got tripped.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.810
(chimes)

12:51.854 --> 12:53.731
The Road Back. They found you.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.065
Let's go, come on.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.066
They're a hundred yards out.
Wait.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.318
What if I talk to them

12:57.359 --> 12:58.986
and explain
that my research,

12:59.028 --> 13:00.112
it can't be weaponized?
ROWAN:
The man approaching

13:00.154 --> 13:01.697
is one of their best assassins.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.574
He'll kill you
just to make sure.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.575
Andrita, where do you keep

13:04.617 --> 13:05.618
the baby's food?

13:05.659 --> 13:07.077
The-the bottles?
The formula?

13:07.119 --> 13:08.162
Andrita!

13:08.204 --> 13:09.288
We have to go before

13:09.330 --> 13:10.414
we have no choice but to fight.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.416
Then we split up.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.418
And you take
my baby with you.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.170
I can't put my baby
in harm's way.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.713
And if they're after me,

13:17.755 --> 13:19.757
then splitting up will
buy you time to escape

13:19.799 --> 13:21.133
by leading them away.
They're here.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.927
(baby crying)
ISAAC: We're out of time.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.888
Splitting up is
the only way this works.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.516
I would never build
anyone a weapon willingly,

13:28.557 --> 13:29.767
but if they get
to my baby...

13:29.809 --> 13:30.893
I'll help Andrita escape.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.394
Then you'll have to stay hidden

13:32.436 --> 13:33.938
until we can get you
back to your baby.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.940
We got to go now.
(baby crying)

13:35.981 --> 13:37.608
(crying): I love you
so much, Kahlil.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.527
Mommy loves you so much.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.487
Here, keep him
safe, please.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.240
Oh. (gasping)
I'll go out the back door,
and the rest of you

13:44.281 --> 13:46.116
go out the back window.
It leads to the lake, okay?

13:46.158 --> 13:47.701
Here, take this with you.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.119
I promise we're gonna get
your son back to you, okay?

13:49.161 --> 13:50.621
(pounding on door)

13:50.663 --> 13:52.206
ISAAC:
Come on, go.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.916
(pounding on door)

13:56.168 --> 13:57.294
TOM:
Come on, Lil' K.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.838
Look...
(Kahlil crying)

13:58.879 --> 14:01.006
I made you a world-class
stroller with more mods

14:01.048 --> 14:04.468
than my dad's rocket ship
and you're still not happy, huh?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.762

Okay, okay.

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.909
Okay, okay, all right.
I heard you.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.663
New baby swaddle time.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.375
My dad and I invented
this blanket for NASA.

14:36.792 --> 14:42.006
The material's a classified
synthetic that, apparently,

14:42.047 --> 14:43.757

on the secure line.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.739
Andrita's safe

15:06.780 --> 15:10.326
Also, um,
hit me back real quick,

15:28.344 --> 15:29.929
Exactly.

everything up?

at her house.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.594
You want to start
being honest with me?

21:05.430 --> 21:10.227
25 weeks at Quantico
and "off the record"

21:10.269 --> 21:12.729
is your best
interrogation technique?

21:12.771 --> 21:15.190
(chuckles)
Hmm.

21:15.732 --> 21:19.569
You wouldn't last two weeks,
let alone 25.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.032
It's 20.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.745
Quantico is 20 weeks,

21:28.787 --> 21:32.416

21:44.094 --> 21:45.345

21:51.143 --> 21:54.438

on the property.

30:18.691 --> 30:20.151
On our first date,

30:20.193 --> 30:23.279
I, uh, I told you
that Native Son showed me

30:23.321 --> 30:24.614
that we can't heal our nation

30:24.656 --> 30:27.200
unless we start
from truth, right?

30:27.700 --> 30:29.994

I'm living in fear.

30:31.663 --> 30:32.831

A secret organization
called The Road Back.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.879
Zenzi,

30:39.921 --> 30:41.923
they own me.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.467
The things that
they make me do, I...

30:44.509 --> 30:47.428
I can't have a life
until I'm free of them.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.638
What are you talking about?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.723
For the longest time, I...

30:50.765 --> 30:55.395

to the compromises I've made.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.397
Morally and...

30:59.524 --> 31:01.442
And then I met you.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.486
And I realized that I don't want
to compromise anymore

31:03.528 --> 31:05.613
because I want to be
worthy of a future with you.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.824
But for there to be any way
that's gonna happen,

31:07.866 --> 31:10.326

(sighs)

33:19.956 --> 33:22.917
That moment that we had
the other day

33:22.959 --> 33:24.961
when we almost kissed.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.755
I just want you to know

33:27.797 --> 33:30.508
that you are really
important to me.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.385
And you're important to me, too.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.554
I care about you...
I care about you.

33:35.805 --> 33:36.889
I love you.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.436
Just not like that.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.189
Are you upset at that?
Yeah.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.109
At how weird things
have been between us.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.236
(laughing)

33:51.362 --> 33:54.991
Tom, your life
is my first priority

33:55.033 --> 33:57.869
from the moment I wake up,
to the moment I go to bed.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.246
And getting involved,

34:00.288 --> 34:03.291
that would complicate things
and put you at risk.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.751
I don't want that to happen.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.627
And I agree. Look,

34:06.669 --> 34:08.254
I don't want my life
at risk, either.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.547
I'm too cute to die.

34:09.589 --> 34:12.008
(laughing)

34:12.383 --> 34:15.261
It would've been a...
good kiss though.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.596
Felt real in the moment.

34:16.637 --> 34:17.972
Because only Denzel

34:18.014 --> 34:20.224
could pull that level
of acting off.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.060
Unless you were thinking
about somebody else.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.063
Huh?

34:25.104 --> 34:26.564
And if you were...

34:28.191 --> 34:29.650
...maybe you should go
tell them.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.281
Mm-hmm.

34:45.249 --> 34:48.002
(sighs, clears throat)

34:48.044 --> 34:51.297
(gasps)
You saved our lives.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.674
And you saved mine.

34:53.716 --> 34:56.636
With our combined research
for levitation.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.306
Consider this
a formal invitation

35:04.519 --> 35:09.190
As long as you stay in hiding
until things are safe,

35:09.232 --> 35:11.192
you can practice all
the science you want.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.153
And I've already fabricated
new identities for both of you,

35:14.195 --> 35:17.949
so that way,
you can live a life.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.742
Thank you.

Hmm.

to make this all okay so that
you could feel comfortable

compartmentalize, but I...

37:11.437 --> 37:13.439
I can't do that anymore.

You're saying you don't think
there's something between us?

37:17.151 --> 37:19.237
I'm saying that
it doesn't matter

37:19.278 --> 37:20.947
