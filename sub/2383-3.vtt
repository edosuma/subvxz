00:01.100 --> 00:03.300
<i>Kids, in my early
days of being a professor,</i>

00:03.400 --> 00:04.800
<i>I had one simple goal:</i>

00:04.900 --> 00:06.900
<i>give a lecture that
changes someone's life.</i>

00:07.000 --> 00:10.600
<i>Then one afternoon in 2010,
I achieved that goal.</i>

00:10.674 --> 00:12.258
<i>Unfinished.</i>

00:12.259 --> 00:15.378
Of all the words you could use
to describe La Sagrada Familia...

00:15.379 --> 00:18.314
Brown, pointy, weird...

00:18.915 --> 00:21.316
The one that really seems
to stick is "unfinished."

00:21.317 --> 00:22.402
Why?

00:22.403 --> 00:27.407
Because on June 7, 1926,
the architect Antoni Gaudi...

00:27.408 --> 00:31.527
Whose beard was also brown,
pointy, weird and unfinished...

00:32.463 --> 00:35.131
...was run over by a bus.

00:35.132 --> 00:39.802
And so, his greatest masterpiece
would remain forever...

00:42.400 --> 00:44.457
<i>But first,
let's back up a few days.</i>

00:44.558 --> 00:47.443
Ted, look across the bar.

00:47.444 --> 00:49.962
Three chicks:
one hot, one kind of hot

00:49.963 --> 00:51.998
and one who I'm assuming
is really funny.

00:51.999 --> 00:53.182
We ride!

00:56.070 --> 00:56.903
What's wrong?

00:56.904 --> 00:57.954
I don't know.

00:57.955 --> 00:59.522
Got a burger coming.

01:00.157 --> 01:01.324
Bro, I told you,

01:01.325 --> 01:03.860
if you ever need a wingman,
I'm your guy.

01:03.861 --> 01:06.496
Yeah, I'm not going to go
through that again.

01:06.497 --> 01:08.247
Hi.

01:08.248 --> 01:09.832
Barney Stinson.

01:09.833 --> 01:12.418
And I'm Marshall,
Barney's wingman.

01:16.173 --> 01:18.091
Thank you for your time.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.894
Fine. I'll have a three-way
with hot and kind of hot

01:21.895 --> 01:23.012
while Giggles works the camera.

01:23.013 --> 01:24.180
I ride!

01:25.399 --> 01:26.849
So, get this:

01:26.850 --> 01:28.935
Last night, I was watching TV,
and it turns out,

01:28.936 --> 01:30.436
some random satellite channel

01:30.437 --> 01:33.122
picks up a certain
local Chicago newscast.

01:33.123 --> 01:36.659
<i>And now, the 11:00
News with Don Frank.</i>

01:37.611 --> 01:39.245
Oh, man, it's
bad enough

01:39.246 --> 01:40.913
to have to go through
a horrible breakup,

01:40.914 --> 01:43.082
but then have that
person pop up on your TV?

01:43.083 --> 01:44.333
Are you okay?

01:44.334 --> 01:46.536
Well, I'll admit, at first,
I felt a little weird.

01:46.537 --> 01:49.422
<i>But after the initial shock,
I realized something:</i>

01:49.423 --> 01:51.290
<i>I've moved on.</i>

01:53.127 --> 01:56.462
Finished with that.

01:57.631 --> 02:00.249
It was a peaceful
moment of closure.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.217
That's great.

02:01.218 --> 02:03.469
- Good on you.
- Yeah, thank you.

02:03.470 --> 02:04.587
Where's the
poop, Robin?

02:04.588 --> 02:05.822
Excuse me?

02:05.823 --> 02:08.473
When I was a kid, I
had a dog named Bean.

02:08.475 --> 02:11.360
Whenever he made the face
that you're making right now,

02:11.361 --> 02:14.831
you just knew he pooped
somewhere in the house.

02:15.783 --> 02:17.433
Where's the poop, Robin?

02:17.434 --> 02:19.535
I don't know what you're talking
about. Where's the poop, Robin?

02:19.536 --> 02:21.154
There's no poop.
Where's the poop?

02:21.155 --> 02:22.438
Okay.

02:22.439 --> 02:24.957
So it wasn't entirely
a peaceful moment of closure.

02:24.958 --> 02:27.627
Hey, Don, here's
some breaking news:

02:27.628 --> 02:31.280
there's a zit breaking out
on your forehead.

02:34.117 --> 02:35.635
Finished with that.

02:39.006 --> 02:42.091
Look, I'm not proud,
but Don left so quickly

02:42.092 --> 02:44.510
that I never got the chance
to have that final showdown.

02:44.511 --> 02:48.964
So yelling at him, even on TV,
felt kind of good.

02:48.965 --> 02:50.266
And you know what?

02:50.267 --> 02:53.186
Now I truly am over him.

02:53.187 --> 02:54.821
That's great.
Thank you.

02:54.822 --> 02:55.855
Good on you.

02:55.856 --> 02:57.156
Where's the
poop, Robin?

02:57.157 --> 02:58.524
Damn it!

02:58.525 --> 03:01.744
Okay, in the process
of truly getting over him,

03:01.745 --> 03:04.030
I may have called him

03:04.031 --> 03:07.633
and left an...
indelicate voice mail.

03:07.634 --> 03:09.886
I am gonna kill you.

03:09.887 --> 03:13.289
I'm gonna fly to Chicago,
kill you,

03:13.290 --> 03:18.060
put your stupid face
on a deep dish pizza and eat it.

03:18.061 --> 03:20.213
And then maybe
catch a Bears game.

03:20.214 --> 03:24.600
But mostly the killing
and eating your face thing.

03:24.601 --> 03:25.834
Give me your phone.

03:25.835 --> 03:27.470
We're deleting
Don's number.

03:27.471 --> 03:28.771
Don't worry.

03:28.772 --> 03:30.339
I am never doing that again.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.574
It was a one-time thing.

03:31.575 --> 03:32.558
Prove it.

03:32.559 --> 03:33.559
Delete contact.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.147
There. Deleted.

03:39.650 --> 03:41.984
Back already.

03:41.985 --> 03:44.070
How was flying solo?

03:44.071 --> 03:48.958
And by "solo," I mean
so low that you got shot down.

03:49.693 --> 03:51.327
Look, I didn't get shot down.

03:51.328 --> 03:53.596
Trust me, I'll get the yes.

03:53.597 --> 03:57.917
Barney Stinson
always gets the yes.

03:57.918 --> 03:59.252
This is all

03:59.253 --> 04:00.253
part of the plan.

04:00.254 --> 04:01.504
After initial contact,

04:01.505 --> 04:03.472
I'm now in the ignoring phase.

04:03.473 --> 04:05.992
Barney, why can't you just
take a girl out to dinner

04:05.993 --> 04:07.193
like a normal person?

04:07.194 --> 04:11.847
Golden rule: I do not
buy dinner to get the yes.

04:11.848 --> 04:14.617
Dinner's a very
intimate activity.

04:14.618 --> 04:15.735
It requires

04:15.736 --> 04:18.571
a level of connection
and eye contact

04:18.572 --> 04:19.789
that sex just doesn't.

04:20.524 --> 04:21.774
Call me old-fashioned,

04:21.774 --> 04:24.660
but I need to have sex
with a girl at least three times

04:24.661 --> 04:27.029
before I'll even consider
having dinner with her.

04:27.030 --> 04:29.115
<i>The next day,
at the university,</i>

04:29.116 --> 04:30.082
<i>I had a surprise visitor.</i>

04:30.083 --> 04:31.900
What are you
doing here?

04:31.901 --> 04:33.336
Oh, God!

04:33.337 --> 04:34.787
You're dating
one of my students.

04:34.788 --> 04:36.422
It's Rachel, isn't it?

04:36.423 --> 04:38.341
Barney, I know
she wears provocative sweaters,

04:38.342 --> 04:39.375
but she's 19!

04:40.210 --> 04:41.510
Now I'm gonna have to hear

04:41.511 --> 04:42.795
all about it, right?

04:42.796 --> 04:44.714
Go on, tell me every detail.

04:44.715 --> 04:46.632
No, you pent-up old perv.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.250
I brought you
a present.

04:50.103 --> 04:52.355
Recognize this?

04:52.356 --> 04:53.889
It's my building.

04:53.890 --> 04:56.759
<i>Kids, you may remember that,
a few years earlier,</i>

04:56.760 --> 05:00.112
<i>I was chosen to design
the new Manhattan headquarters</i>

05:00.113 --> 05:01.447
<i>for Goliath National Bank.</i>

05:01.448 --> 05:04.200
<i>It was the opportunity
every architect dreams about.</i>

05:04.201 --> 05:07.286
<i>And when the project
was ultimately scrapped...</i>

05:07.287 --> 05:08.955
<i>it broke my heart.</i>

05:08.956 --> 05:12.708
Do you remember how awesome
it was to be co-workers...

05:12.709 --> 05:15.494
Nay, bro-workers?

05:15.495 --> 05:17.446
Wait a minute.
Y-You don't mean...

05:17.447 --> 05:20.416
Ted Mosby, it's back on.

05:20.417 --> 05:23.302
We're gonna build
your building.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

05:37.815 --> 05:40.199
This is awesome... You're
designing our new headquarters.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.484
Now, there will be
voices that tell you

05:42.485 --> 05:44.636
a hockey rink on
the roof is unfeasible.

05:44.637 --> 05:47.100
You've got to shut
those voices out.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.900
Actually, I think
I'm gonna say no.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.493
No? Are you kidding me?

05:51.494 --> 05:53.495
But designing a building
in New York City

05:53.496 --> 05:54.946
is your lifelong dream.

05:54.947 --> 05:57.599
I do not want
to work for GNB again.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.833
Those guys are evil.

05:58.834 --> 05:59.901
No offense, Marshall.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.870
Dude, none taken.

06:01.871 --> 06:06.257
Yes, GNB is,
the Empire from Star Wars.

06:06.258 --> 06:09.127
But the Death Star's gonna
get built either way.

06:09.128 --> 06:11.429
And don't you think
the architect of the Death Star

06:11.430 --> 06:14.082
is pretty psyched to have that
thing on his space resume?

06:14.083 --> 06:15.249
I mean, yes,

06:15.250 --> 06:16.918
his design was flawed
in the sense

06:16.919 --> 06:19.020
that a single bullet
fired into a particular vent

06:19.021 --> 06:20.638
would explode the whole thing.

06:20.639 --> 06:22.474
For all we know,
that was the contractor's fault.

06:22.475 --> 06:24.726
But that won't happen on
your watch... you know why?

06:24.727 --> 06:25.810
Because you're Ted Mosby!

06:25.811 --> 06:28.146
And you are gonna design
the most beautiful,

06:28.147 --> 06:30.698
ventless, Rebel-proof building
in Manhattan,

06:30.699 --> 06:33.318
with clearly marked
emergency stops

06:33.319 --> 06:35.436
for every trash compactor
on the detention level.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.906
Look, I know this is
hard to understand,

06:37.907 --> 06:41.843
but right now, I have a quiet,
simple, happy little life.

06:41.844 --> 06:43.495
And I like it that way.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.114
I know what my answer has to be.

06:46.115 --> 06:47.549
I can't take
the job, Barney.

06:47.550 --> 06:49.217
I'm done with that life.

06:49.218 --> 06:50.284
No hard feelings?

06:50.285 --> 06:52.170
Of course not.

06:52.171 --> 06:54.288
All right.

06:56.008 --> 06:58.059
Hey, Professor Mosby.
Hey, Rachel.

07:00.312 --> 07:02.480
<i>And I thought that was
the end of the story.</i>

07:02.481 --> 07:03.565
<i>But then that night...</i>

07:03.566 --> 07:04.516
I'm telling you,

07:04.517 --> 07:06.401
no architect would ever design

07:06.402 --> 07:09.104
a giant exposed vent right over
a Death Star's core reactor.

07:09.105 --> 07:10.304
That's Space
Architecture 101.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.323
It had to be the contractor.

07:12.324 --> 07:13.575
Barney, back me up.

07:14.827 --> 07:16.027
Barney.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.913
Dude, this is important.

07:18.914 --> 07:20.098
I need another drink.

07:20.099 --> 07:21.533
Marshall, you want anything?

07:22.084 --> 07:23.985
No, I'm fine.

07:25.838 --> 07:28.273
Okay, I get that he's mad at me
for turning down the job,

07:28.274 --> 07:29.557
but acting like
I'm not even here?

07:29.558 --> 07:31.826
Wait, you turned down the job?
When?

07:31.827 --> 07:32.660
This morning.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.096
That's so weird.

07:35.097 --> 07:37.682
Just, like, an hour ago,
when we were leaving work...

07:37.683 --> 07:39.834
So, you still think
Ted's gonna take the job?

07:39.835 --> 07:41.436
Please.

07:41.437 --> 07:42.654
I'll get the yes.

07:42.655 --> 07:46.891
Barney Stinson
always gets the yes.

07:49.728 --> 07:51.946
Am I wrong or is that
exactly what Barney says

07:51.947 --> 07:53.765
when he's putting the moves
on a girl?

07:53.766 --> 07:55.016
Exactly. I mean,
it's almost like

07:55.017 --> 07:56.234
he's putting the moves on you.

07:56.235 --> 07:57.535
Yeah, more like the opposite.

07:57.536 --> 08:00.355
He's been ignoring me all night.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.176
Barney wants me
to take the job so bad

08:05.177 --> 08:06.361
he's putting the moves on me?

08:06.362 --> 08:08.863
I hope that's his end game.

08:08.864 --> 08:09.881
Actually, I don't.

08:09.882 --> 08:11.633
I like you two together.

08:11.634 --> 08:12.667
I don't buy it.

08:12.668 --> 08:14.252
That's crazy, even for Barney.

08:14.253 --> 08:15.336
Okay, well, think about it.

08:15.337 --> 08:16.971
We've seen his moves
countless times.

08:16.972 --> 08:19.641
What does he do after
he's done ignoring a girl?

08:19.642 --> 08:21.643
Chrissy, I love
your glasses.

08:21.644 --> 08:22.677
Really?

08:22.678 --> 08:23.878
They totally
pull focus up

08:23.879 --> 08:25.947
from that whole chin
situation you got going on.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.099
To Chrissy.

08:28.701 --> 08:30.068
The backhanded compliment

08:30.069 --> 08:32.604
to lower her self-esteem...
a proven winner.

08:32.605 --> 08:33.605
But Barney hasn't done...

08:33.606 --> 08:35.607
Ted, I admire your loyalty.

08:35.607 --> 08:38.359
You've had
that hairstyle forever.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.994
You don't care
that it's out of fashion

08:39.995 --> 08:41.880
or that it's been co-opted
by the lesbian community.

08:41.881 --> 08:43.063
You stick with it.

08:43.866 --> 08:44.832
To Ted.

08:45.668 --> 08:47.568
Hey, Lily!

08:47.569 --> 08:51.405
Don't "Hey, Lily" me.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.325
I smelled poop all the way
from the hallway.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.927
Oh, no, not this again.

08:55.928 --> 08:57.295
Where's the poop, Robin?

08:57.296 --> 09:00.048
Okay, I left Don
another message.

09:00.933 --> 09:02.250
"This just in"

09:02.251 --> 09:03.685
is what I'm gonna say

09:03.686 --> 09:05.920
when I'm stabbing you.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.355
But that's impossible.

09:07.356 --> 09:08.589
You deleted
his number.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.557
I tried to.

09:09.558 --> 09:10.692
But then this thing popped up

09:10.693 --> 09:12.426
on my phone that said,
"Are you sure?"

09:12.427 --> 09:13.611
And I wasn't sure.

09:13.612 --> 09:15.113
I can't lie to my phone.

09:15.114 --> 09:18.399
Oh, sweetie,
I totally understand.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.484
Delete it!

09:19.485 --> 09:20.985
It's not that easy, okay?

09:20.986 --> 09:22.436
You're not just
deleting a number,

09:22.437 --> 09:24.572
you're deleting
a part of your life.

09:24.573 --> 09:25.606
You know, all those

09:25.607 --> 09:27.125
memories, all those experiences.

09:27.126 --> 09:30.044
It's like you're admitting
they're gone forever.

09:30.045 --> 09:31.963
I know, sweetie.

09:31.964 --> 09:33.131
I know.

09:33.132 --> 09:34.382
Delete it!

09:34.383 --> 09:36.000
Okay, if it's that easy,

09:36.001 --> 09:37.952
I'm gonna delete one of
your numbers from your phone,

09:37.953 --> 09:38.836
see how you like it.

09:38.837 --> 09:39.887
My "plezh."

09:39.888 --> 09:41.806
If you can find
a number in there

09:41.807 --> 09:44.125
that I don't call regularly,
I'll gladly delete it.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.727
Super Kicks Karate.

09:45.728 --> 09:46.761
No, not that one.

09:46.762 --> 09:48.396
That's my dojo.

09:48.397 --> 09:49.897
You have a dojo?

09:49.898 --> 09:52.934
I took an introductory
karate class.

09:54.570 --> 09:56.070
Ops, wrong room.

09:56.071 --> 09:59.157
Where do the grown-ups go
for the real karate class?

09:59.158 --> 10:00.942
What's the matter, lady?

10:00.943 --> 10:02.143
You scared?

10:03.162 --> 10:04.195
Of you? Please.

10:04.196 --> 10:05.913
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

10:05.914 --> 10:07.966
I hated kindergarten.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.701
All three times.

10:12.004 --> 10:14.872
But I'm totally gonna
sign up for more lessons.

10:14.873 --> 10:17.425
How long ago
did you take that class?

10:17.426 --> 10:18.492
I don't know.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.927
It was around the time

10:19.928 --> 10:23.431
when everyone was going,
"Wassuuuuuuup!"

10:24.383 --> 10:26.167
How do you even remember that?

10:26.168 --> 10:28.770
Wassuuuuuup...!

10:28.771 --> 10:31.889
Lily, this is a number
that you will never dial again.

10:31.890 --> 10:32.724
I might.
No, no.

10:32.725 --> 10:34.058
But you keep it in your phone

10:34.059 --> 10:35.810
because it reminds you
of a version of yourself

10:35.811 --> 10:38.396
that you could be, even if
it's a version of yourself

10:38.397 --> 10:39.614
that you'll never become.

10:39.615 --> 10:40.848
And that's okay.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.200
No, it's not.

10:42.201 --> 10:43.318
Okay, you know what?

10:43.319 --> 10:45.320
There, gone.

10:45.321 --> 10:46.537
Your move,
Scherbatsky.

10:47.790 --> 10:49.874
I finally know
what your kind goes through.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.409
I get it now.

10:51.410 --> 10:53.694
For the last time,
I don't care how big it was,

10:53.695 --> 10:55.529
it is not the same
as giving birth.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.498
No!

10:57.499 --> 10:59.467
Barney's been
"putting the moves" on Ted.

10:59.468 --> 11:02.136
Oh, that sucks.

11:02.137 --> 11:04.422
Although I like
you two together.

11:04.423 --> 11:07.141
No, he's been doing it to try
to get Ted to design

11:07.142 --> 11:09.260
the new GNB Tower.

11:09.261 --> 11:10.544
Which moves
are we talking about?

11:10.545 --> 11:12.613
Did he do the thing where
he brags on himself

11:12.614 --> 11:13.731
in the form of a complaint?

11:13.732 --> 11:15.099
Man, every time

11:15.100 --> 11:17.151
I take out my business card

11:17.152 --> 11:20.388
and women see the GNB logo,
they throw themselves at me.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.606
I miss the chase.

11:21.607 --> 11:23.241
It sucks!

11:23.242 --> 11:24.542
Man, the courtside
Knicks seats

11:24.543 --> 11:28.529
that are available to all
upper level GNB employees

11:28.530 --> 11:30.081
are too close to the action.

11:30.082 --> 11:31.749
I keep getting sweat on my suit.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.034
It sucks!

11:33.035 --> 11:34.168
Man,

11:34.169 --> 11:36.904
GNB's benefits package
is so comprehensive

11:36.905 --> 11:39.474
it gives me the freedom to see
any doctor I want.

11:39.475 --> 11:41.259
It sucks!

11:41.260 --> 11:42.410
He did.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.095
And the intense eye contact
thing?

11:44.096 --> 11:45.630
So, Ted,

11:45.631 --> 11:49.133
would you like to split
some jalapeno poppers?

11:52.921 --> 11:55.440
Okay.

11:55.441 --> 11:56.590
Yep.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.643
And the thing where he
establishs intimacy

11:58.644 --> 12:00.311
through physical contact?

12:00.312 --> 12:02.480
You know why jalapeÃ±o poppers
are so good?

12:02.481 --> 12:04.031
It's the cream cheese.

12:04.032 --> 12:06.951
That is so true.

12:06.952 --> 12:08.202
Yeah...

12:08.203 --> 12:10.905
Cream cheese has
a mild flav-flavor

12:10.906 --> 12:15.042
so it... it balances out
the spiciness of the jal...

12:15.043 --> 12:17.278
the spiciness of the...

12:17.279 --> 12:19.547
Dude!

12:20.416 --> 12:21.799
So at any point in this

12:21.800 --> 12:23.784
did you say, "Barney,
I know what you're doing,

12:23.785 --> 12:25.186
"and it's not going to work.

12:25.187 --> 12:26.671
I am not taking that job"?

12:26.672 --> 12:29.690
Well, I mean, not
exactly in those...

12:29.691 --> 12:31.092
You're loving this.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.126
No.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.361
You are.

12:33.362 --> 12:35.629
You're loving the attention.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.483
It's nice to be wanted, okay?

12:38.484 --> 12:41.686
And, yes, this is a new vest.
Thank you all for noticing.

12:41.687 --> 12:43.037
Oh, that's right, you didn't.

12:43.038 --> 12:44.238
Barney did!

12:44.239 --> 12:45.640
Oh, Teddy,

12:45.641 --> 12:47.641
you are so going
to spread your legs

12:47.642 --> 12:49.477
and design that building.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.696
I am not that kind
of architect.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.651
So get this... Robin never
deleted Don's number.

12:57.652 --> 12:58.703
Wait...

12:59.838 --> 13:01.255
Oh, everyone thinks
it's so easy.

13:01.256 --> 13:02.373
Give me your phone.

13:02.374 --> 13:03.541
Let's delete
one of yours.

13:03.542 --> 13:04.792
Okay.

13:04.793 --> 13:06.160
No problem.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.212
If you can find a number
that I don't need

13:08.213 --> 13:09.931
or shouldn't have in here,
be my guest,

13:09.932 --> 13:11.516
but good luck.

13:11.517 --> 13:13.384
I keep my phone tight.

13:13.385 --> 13:15.386
Edwin.
Oh, no, not that one.

13:15.387 --> 13:18.222
That's the booker for the club
that my band plays at.

13:18.223 --> 13:20.258
You know, my all-lawyer
funk band... you remember...

13:20.259 --> 13:23.060
The Funk, the Whole Funk
and Nothing but the Funk.

13:23.061 --> 13:27.815
* Your witness lied
so your case is sunk, hah! *

13:27.816 --> 13:31.702
* I sentence you
to a life of funk *

13:31.703 --> 13:33.621
* Counselors,
how do you plead? *

13:33.622 --> 13:35.490
* Funky. *

13:35.491 --> 13:38.025
Kick it.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.965
You guys played one gig
four years ago.

13:43.966 --> 13:45.416
I'm deleting it.

13:45.417 --> 13:47.752
No, no, we're gonna... we're
gonna play another gig again.

13:47.753 --> 13:48.970
Probably really soon.

13:48.971 --> 13:51.205
It's just we all got
super busy, and...

13:52.707 --> 13:55.309
We're not going to play
another gig again, are we?

13:55.310 --> 13:57.061
Probably not, baby.

13:57.062 --> 13:59.347
See, it's hard to hit
that delete button, isn't it?

13:59.348 --> 14:01.983
Well, it's just that without
that number in my phone,

14:01.984 --> 14:03.384
I'm just a corporate lawyer

14:03.385 --> 14:06.404
working 60 very un-funky hours
a week.

14:06.405 --> 14:08.022
Sorry, Marshall.

14:08.023 --> 14:10.658
But if I have to, you have to.

14:16.832 --> 14:18.966
Okay. Your turn.

14:20.000 --> 14:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:31.930 --> 14:33.381
Barney, I gotta
tell you something.

14:33.382 --> 14:35.216
Oh, that reminds me.

14:35.217 --> 14:37.935
I got you a little airplane.

14:37.936 --> 14:40.805
It represents the spirit
of adventure.

14:40.806 --> 14:42.640
Do you like it, Ted?

14:43.442 --> 14:45.343
Do you?

14:45.344 --> 14:46.394
Stop it.

14:46.395 --> 14:47.695
Stop looking at me

14:47.696 --> 14:50.398
like I'm the only person
in the world who matters.

14:50.399 --> 14:52.650
I'm not designing the GNB Tower.

14:52.651 --> 14:53.868
Yeah, I know.

14:53.869 --> 14:54.969
You turned it down.

14:54.970 --> 14:56.103
We hired someone else.

14:59.825 --> 15:01.075
Can you believe it?

15:01.076 --> 15:02.943
He's resorting
to the oldest move in the book.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.129
The classic, "pretend to take
the offer off the table

15:05.130 --> 15:06.380
so I'll want it more."

15:06.381 --> 15:07.548
It's so obvious, right?

15:07.549 --> 15:09.450
As if that's going to make me
be like,

15:09.451 --> 15:11.836
"Oh, God, I never
should have said no."

15:11.837 --> 15:13.354
It's not a move, dude.

15:13.355 --> 15:16.691
I executed the paperwork for
the new architect this morning.

15:16.692 --> 15:18.976
Barney wasn't lying.

15:19.811 --> 15:22.415
Oh, God, I never should
have said no!

15:25.700 --> 15:28.500
Come on, GNB didn't really
hire a new architect.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.993
This is just one
of Barney's moves.

15:29.994 --> 15:31.227
It's not a move, dude.

15:31.228 --> 15:32.812
The senior partners
were getting impatient.

15:32.813 --> 15:35.465
I thought you didn't
even want the job.

15:35.466 --> 15:36.348
I didn't!

15:36.768 --> 15:40.886
I don't!
I don't. I don't!

15:40.887 --> 15:43.138
- Okay, I'll do it!
- What?

15:43.139 --> 15:45.024
Ted, it's too late.

15:45.025 --> 15:46.141
I'll design it for half

15:46.142 --> 15:47.776
of what you're paying
the other architect.

15:47.777 --> 15:50.646
And you know I will do stuff
they would never do.

15:50.647 --> 15:52.865
Lobby stuff.

15:52.866 --> 15:54.116
Wow, half?

15:54.117 --> 15:55.985
Ted,

15:55.986 --> 15:57.769
of behalf of Goliath
National Bank...

15:57.770 --> 15:58.954
Okay, it's a move.

15:58.955 --> 16:00.572
- What?
- Dude!

16:00.573 --> 16:01.991
There is no other architect.

16:01.992 --> 16:03.459
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.776
I was being Barney's wingman,

16:04.777 --> 16:06.578
and I never get to be
the wingman.

16:06.579 --> 16:08.113
You guys lied to me?

16:08.114 --> 16:09.498
You're the world's
worst wingman.

16:09.499 --> 16:12.217
You know what? I'm out of here.

16:12.218 --> 16:14.119
I can do better.
Take me back.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.671
You son of a bitch!

16:15.672 --> 16:18.173
Look, I can't do business
with people who lie to me.

16:18.174 --> 16:21.176
We only lied to you to make you
realize that you want this job.

16:21.177 --> 16:22.344
No, I don't.

16:22.345 --> 16:24.096
I mean, I know I said I did,

16:24.097 --> 16:26.231
but that's only
because I fell for the same

16:26.232 --> 16:28.100
creepy, pickup artist voodoo
of yours

16:28.101 --> 16:29.184
that countless women...

16:29.185 --> 16:30.302
236.

16:30.303 --> 16:31.520
...before me fell for.

16:31.521 --> 16:32.738
Wow, respect.

16:32.739 --> 16:37.693
No... Ted...
you want to do this, okay?

16:37.694 --> 16:39.528
You're just scared
of getting hurt again.

16:39.529 --> 16:41.497
But you can't let fear
steal your funk.

16:41.498 --> 16:43.749
That is good.
There is a song in there.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.067
Excuse me.

16:46.786 --> 16:48.537
Come on, Ted!

16:48.538 --> 16:49.788
This is your dream.

16:49.789 --> 16:52.824
No, it's not. Not anymore.
And you know what?

16:52.825 --> 16:56.295
Letting go of that dream was
the best decision I ever made.

16:56.296 --> 16:57.429
You guys actually think

16:57.430 --> 16:59.481
I have some lingering itch
to be an architect?

16:59.482 --> 17:01.433
Work 20 hours
a day and weekends?

17:01.434 --> 17:04.936
To get ulcers and pull my hair
out and worry and doubt myself

17:04.938 --> 17:06.637
and then at the end of it all,

17:06.638 --> 17:08.440
have the rug pulled out
from under me?

17:08.441 --> 17:10.108
I love being a professor, okay?

17:10.109 --> 17:12.310
All that stupid crap
they tell you

17:12.311 --> 17:13.779
about how fulfilling
teaching is?

17:13.780 --> 17:15.114
It's all true.

17:15.115 --> 17:18.183
I'm happy, and I'm not
letting go of that.

17:18.184 --> 17:19.734
My answer's no.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.958
Hey, guys.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.358
Where's the poop, Robin?

17:27.359 --> 17:28.627
How do you do that?

17:28.628 --> 17:31.046
You are like a bomb-sniffing
dog, except with poop.

17:31.047 --> 17:32.581
You are a poop-sniffing dog.

17:32.582 --> 17:34.616
I think that's
just called a dog.

17:34.617 --> 17:36.418
Where's the poop, Robin?

17:36.419 --> 17:39.338
Fine. I called Don again.

17:40.507 --> 17:43.092
Hey, Don!
It's Robin again.

17:43.093 --> 17:45.177
Look, I am sorry
for all the calls.

17:45.178 --> 17:46.812
It's just,
I saw you on the news,

17:46.813 --> 17:48.931
and it made me a little crazy
for a minute.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.385
I guess I wasn't as
over our breakup as I thought.

17:53.386 --> 17:55.254
But I want to say,

17:55.255 --> 17:57.389
from the bottom of my heart,

17:57.390 --> 17:59.108
I am going to kill you.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.242
No... No, I'm not.

18:00.243 --> 18:02.528
I am happy for you.

18:02.529 --> 18:05.330
And that Asian slut
on your Facebook page.

18:05.331 --> 18:07.483
She's dead, too.

18:07.484 --> 18:09.952
I thought you
deleted his number.

18:09.953 --> 18:12.004
I did, but it turns
out, I memorized it.

18:12.005 --> 18:14.339
You can't delete contacts
from your brain, Lily.

18:14.340 --> 18:15.574
Well, you have to try.

18:15.575 --> 18:16.992
If you ever want
to have closure...

18:16.993 --> 18:18.594
I am never going
to have closure.

18:18.595 --> 18:20.929
Okay? Closure
doesn't exist.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.015
Okay, one day, Don and I
are moving in together,

18:23.016 --> 18:24.216
and the next
thing I know,

18:24.217 --> 18:26.084
he's on a plane
to Chicago.

18:26.085 --> 18:28.937
It just... ended.

18:28.938 --> 18:32.307
And no matter how much I try
to forget that it happened,

18:32.308 --> 18:34.776
it will have never
not happened.

18:34.777 --> 18:36.912
Don and I will always
be a loose end.

18:36.913 --> 18:38.730
We'll always be...

18:38.731 --> 18:41.066
Unfinished.

18:43.019 --> 18:45.637
Gaudi, to his credit,
never gave up on his dream,

18:45.638 --> 18:47.656
but that's not
usually how it goes.

18:47.657 --> 18:50.159
I mean, usually,
it isn't a speeding bus

18:50.160 --> 18:53.462
that keeps the brown, pointy,
weird church from getting built.

18:53.463 --> 18:56.198
<i>Most of the time,
it's just too difficult</i>

18:56.199 --> 18:59.134
<i>or too expensive,
or too scary.</i>

18:59.135 --> 19:02.254
<i>It's only once you've stopped</i>

19:02.255 --> 19:05.757
<i>that you realize how hard it is
to start again.</i>

19:05.758 --> 19:09.628
<i>So you force yourself
not to want it.</i>

19:09.629 --> 19:11.230
But it's always there.

19:11.231 --> 19:14.016
And until you finish it,
it will always be...

19:14.017 --> 19:16.652
* You keep on searching *

19:16.653 --> 19:23.659
* While you're
waiting for that sound *

19:23.660 --> 19:25.160
* What you find *

19:25.161 --> 19:28.530
* Ain't what
you had in mind... *

19:31.584 --> 19:33.418
Hey, Barney.
Hey, Rachel.

19:33.419 --> 19:36.004
Rachel, why aren't
you in class?

19:36.005 --> 19:37.222
Why aren't you in class?

19:37.223 --> 19:40.209
Yeah, Ted.
Why aren't you in class?

19:44.964 --> 19:46.798
You son of a bitch.

19:48.101 --> 19:49.551
I'll call Marshall.

19:49.552 --> 19:50.969
We'll draw up the contract.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.221
Not so fast.

19:52.222 --> 19:53.838
I'm not that easy.

19:53.839 --> 19:56.642
<i>And so I made Barney
break his golden rule.</i>

19:56.643 --> 19:58.277
<i>I made him take me
out to dinner</i>

19:58.278 --> 20:02.731
<i>before I finally gave him
the thing he always got.</i>

20:02.732 --> 20:04.349
Yes.

20:05.385 --> 20:08.420
<i>And even though
it didn't happen right away...</i>

20:08.421 --> 20:11.856
And now, the 11:00
News with Don Frank.

20:15.378 --> 20:17.095
<i>Bueno?</i>

20:17.096 --> 20:18.914
Who is this?

20:18.915 --> 20:20.499
<i>No hablo ingles.</i>

20:20.500 --> 20:21.900
<i>Quien es?</i>

20:21.901 --> 20:24.486
I'm sorry. Is this 917-456...

20:24.487 --> 20:26.555
I'm sorry, 465...

20:26.556 --> 20:28.123
No, wait.

20:29.792 --> 20:33.178
<i>Robin finally
got some closure, too.</i>

20:33.679 --> 20:36.097
Sorry. Wrong number.

20:39.885 --> 20:42.036
Finished with that.

20:52.914 --> 20:54.147
Hey, punk!

20:54.148 --> 20:55.498
Bit of advice.

20:55.499 --> 20:58.969
Next time you step on a
kindergarten teacher's neck,

20:58.970 --> 21:01.338
you better finish the job.

21:01.339 --> 21:02.839
I knew this day would come.
