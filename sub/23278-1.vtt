01:21.084 --> 01:22.728
Shit!

01:26.588 --> 01:28.100
Shit!

01:42.838 --> 01:45.251
Fucking Christ on a stick!

03:18.034 --> 03:19.544
Shit.

03:27.476 --> 03:28.987
Hello?

03:30.379 --> 03:32.237
Is anybody there?

03:32.317 --> 03:34.325
Is anybody home?

03:49.564 --> 03:51.443
My car broke down.

03:53.835 --> 03:55.881
I could use some help.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.620
Hello?

04:09.951 --> 04:11.462
Hello?

04:40.182 --> 04:41.747
So you're just gonna suffer!

04:46.154 --> 04:48.884
Or I will end this right now!

04:49.892 --> 04:51.770
Do you hear me?

06:52.868 --> 06:56.405
- Special Agent Francis, I presume?
- Pleased to meet you, Deputy Salter.

06:56.485 --> 06:58.574
You can call me Colt. Everybody does.

06:58.654 --> 07:00.643
Did you want to grab a bite
before we hit the station?

07:00.723 --> 07:02.912
Marnie's serves up the best
chicken fried steak you ever tasted.

07:02.992 --> 07:05.481
- I'm vegan.
- Okay.

07:05.561 --> 07:07.984
Great. Well, I'll just grab somethin' later.

07:08.064 --> 07:10.535
- I'll take that for ya.
- Shall we go then?

07:11.500 --> 07:14.312
Yeah. I'll get that for you, ma'am.

08:30.612 --> 08:34.438
- Hey, Colt. What's crackalackin'?
- Jenna, this is Special Agent Francis.

08:35.217 --> 08:37.941
- The sheriff around?
- How you doing? No, he's still out.

08:38.020 --> 08:41.010
- Should be back soon though.
- We had an appointment for 1:00.

08:41.090 --> 08:43.780
You just take a seat, sweetie,
and I'm sure he won't be long.

08:43.860 --> 08:46.282
Okay. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Anybody want anything?

08:46.362 --> 08:48.640
Two splendas, no cream, please.

09:12.487 --> 09:14.177
- Sheriff.
- Yeah, hang on, hon.

09:14.257 --> 09:15.978
Jenna, you got any of those
wet naps back there?

09:16.058 --> 09:17.467
- You betcha.
- Colt.

09:17.547 --> 09:19.849
A little friend for you
out there in the trunk.

09:19.929 --> 09:21.804
Okay. Right on it, Sheriff.

09:21.884 --> 09:24.542
You better get the hand truck for Colt.

09:24.667 --> 09:28.714
That idiot's gonna realize it's gonna be
too much weight for him to shift himself.

09:31.473 --> 09:35.195
Special Agent Francis. How you doing?
We've been expecting you.

09:35.845 --> 09:37.086
Pleasure to meet you, Sheriff.

09:37.166 --> 09:41.456
I'm sorry, you seem to have caught us
right in the middle of our local crime spree.

09:41.536 --> 09:43.414
Hit-and-run white tail.

09:46.141 --> 09:47.597
Yeah.

09:47.677 --> 09:51.176
Step on into the back,
see what we can do you for.

09:52.347 --> 09:54.192
There you go.

09:55.951 --> 09:57.795
Have a seat.

09:58.220 --> 09:59.942
Here it is.

10:00.022 --> 10:01.944
Not much to it.

10:02.024 --> 10:04.927
Pretty much a waste of yours
and the bureau's time, if you ask me.

10:05.007 --> 10:08.210
- I'd like to speak to him first thing.
- Who? Pritchard?

10:08.290 --> 10:11.254
Colt and I were just out there three days
ago to see him, have a look around.

10:11.334 --> 10:14.657
His wife's car is missing.
Other than that, nothing out of the ordinary.

10:14.737 --> 10:17.994
- It's all right there. In the report.
- I see that.

10:18.474 --> 10:20.930
But I'd still like to get
my own sense of the man.

10:21.010 --> 10:25.063
It's odd, he didn't file the report.
Her sister did, right?

10:25.143 --> 10:28.797
That's right. Maria and the boy were
on the way to her house so Theresa...

10:28.877 --> 10:31.529
...would've been the first one
to notice that they'd gone missing.

10:32.021 --> 10:34.343
I've known Jackson Pritchard his whole life.

10:34.423 --> 10:38.160
Colt there went to high school with the man.
Yeah, I know, he's got a temper...

10:38.240 --> 10:40.883
...but he is not a murderer by any stretch.

10:40.963 --> 10:44.318
Who said anything about murder?
Although now that you mention it...

10:44.398 --> 10:47.390
...45 percent of all murdered women
are killed by their domestic partner.

10:47.470 --> 10:51.294
You wanna know the most likely scenario?
Maria finally got a bellyful of his bullshit...

10:51.374 --> 10:54.330
...and she lit off with the kid
for Minneapolis or Winnipeg or...

10:54.410 --> 10:58.200
Without telling her sister?
Or anyone? That doesn't seem right.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.402
Why don't you go out
and question the sister then?

11:00.482 --> 11:03.462
I'm pretty sure she'll agree with me.
But leave Pritchard out of it.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.941
There's a valid line of inquiry
that needs to be followed up on.

11:06.021 --> 11:07.937
We have done the follow-up, Agent.

11:08.017 --> 11:10.847
Look, I know my department's
under scrutiny right now...

11:10.927 --> 11:14.117
...but give us a shred of credit
for understanding our community...

11:14.197 --> 11:16.753
...and how to do our goddamn jobs.

11:17.533 --> 11:22.192
So how about we trust my instinct
on this one, Special Agent Francis?

11:22.972 --> 11:26.295
Yours didn't seem to do
that Breeland girl any favors.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.811
Sheriff, Rudolph is in the ice box.

11:28.891 --> 11:30.732
Colt, take our distinguished guest out...

11:30.812 --> 11:33.108
...to see Theresa Locke and then
get her set up at the Kelly Inn.

11:33.188 --> 11:36.049
Right on it. Ma'am? Ready to go?

11:37.952 --> 11:42.367
Despite what happened to
the Breeland girl, Sheriff, I found her.

11:43.725 --> 11:45.081
And I wouldn't change that.

11:45.161 --> 11:49.040
Apparently, some people are
just better off not being found.

12:36.678 --> 12:38.556
Stop it!

12:40.049 --> 12:43.105
You stop! You stop!

12:43.404 --> 12:45.196
This is your fault!

12:45.620 --> 12:48.900
Your fault you're in here! You understand?

12:50.592 --> 12:53.605
So you're just gonna suffer in silence!

12:55.430 --> 12:57.021
Or I will end this right now!

13:10.111 --> 13:11.967
- You can't smoke in here.
- I don't.

13:12.047 --> 13:14.970
- What're the smokes for, then?
- I quit three years ago.

13:15.050 --> 13:17.073
I keep that around to remind me.

13:18.553 --> 13:20.064
Okay.

13:22.523 --> 13:24.047
He's a caribou, you know, not a deer.

13:24.127 --> 13:26.971
- Who?
- Rudolph.

13:28.296 --> 13:30.456
Reindeer is what they call them in Europe.

13:30.536 --> 13:34.390
The caribou and deer are both from
the Cervidae family. That's Latin for deer.

13:35.070 --> 13:38.716
Heck, the moose, also known as the
Eurasian elk is technically a deer, too.

13:40.076 --> 13:43.165
It's more than just cow chips
and inbreeding out here, you know.

13:43.245 --> 13:45.216
Well played, Deputy Salter.

13:53.121 --> 13:56.735
You know, that's got to be pretty exciting to
compete with this thrill-a-minute landscape.

14:04.097 --> 14:06.722
- Sorry, I was just surfing.
- I was just yankin' your chain.

14:06.802 --> 14:10.014
No, you're right. It's a rude habit.

14:14.175 --> 14:16.254
So, what did you want to talk about?

14:17.412 --> 14:19.703
Okay. You asked.

14:20.583 --> 14:23.606
What was all that talk back there
about the Breeland girl?

14:23.686 --> 14:25.641
Should I be concerned?

14:25.721 --> 14:27.243
Wow.

14:27.323 --> 14:31.180
- You're right. I did ask.
- If you don't wanna talk about it, it's okay.

14:32.894 --> 14:36.386
Seventeen-year-old Tanya Breeland
went missing about a year ago.

14:37.366 --> 14:40.457
It was the first real case I was lead on.

14:41.337 --> 14:44.761
Took all kinds of unpaid overtime, weekends.

14:45.341 --> 14:47.997
I was little obsessed, I guess you could say.

14:48.077 --> 14:50.086
Four months later, I tracked her down...

14:50.166 --> 14:54.025
...to a homeless shelter run by
an Islamist group in St. Paul.

14:56.251 --> 14:58.896
The kicker was,
the girl didn't wanna go home.

15:00.121 --> 15:01.933
She wouldn't say why.

15:03.958 --> 15:06.015
Psych eval was perfectly normal.

15:06.695 --> 15:08.506
Clean drug screen too.

15:13.534 --> 15:15.346
So I just took her home.

15:18.806 --> 15:20.618
<i>She showed up at my office.</i>

15:22.343 --> 15:24.400
<i>Said I ruined her life.</i>

15:24.480 --> 15:26.068
Call 9-1-1!

15:26.148 --> 15:28.893
<i>It all happened so fast. I couldn't stop her.</i>

15:31.786 --> 15:33.598
<i>I couldn't save her.</i>

15:40.161 --> 15:42.039
Good Lord.

15:43.331 --> 15:45.988
I was more focused on solving the case...

15:46.068 --> 15:48.146
...than making sure she was safe.

15:49.804 --> 15:51.861
To protect and serve.

15:52.341 --> 15:54.642
It's a pretty basic concept to follow.

15:56.711 --> 15:58.147
It sounds like you went by the book.

15:58.227 --> 16:01.804
Well, then the book needed to be rewritten
and I should have seen that.

16:01.884 --> 16:03.873
Is that what brings you out here?
Administrative reassignment...

16:04.053 --> 16:06.218
- ...or whatever they call it?
- No.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.966
Actually, I requested
this case when it came in.

16:10.158 --> 16:12.436
You know, you can't beat yourself up.

16:13.461 --> 16:16.073
If you were perfect, you wouldn't be human.

16:51.599 --> 16:54.446
No! You... you are not allowed!

16:59.273 --> 17:01.030
I will not be made a fool of!

17:01.110 --> 17:05.169
I have seen your true face now.
I know what you really are.

17:14.454 --> 17:17.680
Sorry. The... the milk's gone sour.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.482
No, that's fine. Thanks, Theresa.

17:20.561 --> 17:22.573
So this is a regular thing?

17:23.798 --> 17:27.423
- Excuse me?
- Your sister and her son staying here.

17:27.502 --> 17:30.526
- You expected them five days ago, right?
- Yeah, thereabouts.

17:30.606 --> 17:32.661
Jonah had the flu, so we...

17:32.741 --> 17:35.597
...they were gonna come by
as soon as he got better.

17:35.677 --> 17:37.633
I wouldn't call it a regular thing.

17:37.713 --> 17:40.716
They just come by when they need
to get away for a spell.

17:40.796 --> 17:42.918
Get away? How so?

17:42.998 --> 17:46.542
Life can get pretty dreary out there
at that place of theirs, you know?

17:46.622 --> 17:50.980
- Could you be more specific?
- The farm hasn't turned to profit for years.

17:51.060 --> 17:53.649
The old house is falling apart.

17:53.729 --> 17:56.373
Times are tough. It...

17:57.982 --> 17:59.221
...gets stressful.

17:59.301 --> 18:03.259
And Mr. Pritchard, is he a source
of that stress in your opinion?

18:03.639 --> 18:05.928
I know he's a friend of yours, Colt.

18:06.008 --> 18:10.688
That was 15 years ago. We have more of
a smile and nod kind of a relationship now.

18:11.779 --> 18:12.838
It's okay.

18:12.918 --> 18:16.604
Well, him and me never really
got along well, and...

18:17.331 --> 18:20.197
...he's been in the county
lock-up more than once.

18:23.824 --> 18:26.882
Drunk and disorderly, simple assault.

18:26.962 --> 18:29.918
Yeah, but... but in the last
couple of years...

18:29.998 --> 18:33.655
...I don't know, he's just...
he's changed, he's sullen all the time.

18:33.735 --> 18:36.358
He... his temper's getting worse.

18:36.438 --> 18:38.660
I mean, the littlest thing will set him off.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.998
- Could you give me an example?
- One time, Jonah...

18:42.778 --> 18:45.640
...spilled some paint on the porch...

18:45.720 --> 18:49.505
...and Jackson dragged the boy into his room
and locked him in overnight without supper.

18:49.585 --> 18:52.000
He wouldn't even let him go to the bathroom.

18:52.488 --> 18:55.153
Maria was livid like
I've never seen. I mean...

18:55.233 --> 18:58.794
...after everything that's happened,
that boy is her precious little miracle.

18:58.874 --> 19:02.084
- How do you mean?
- Well, they got married real young...

19:02.164 --> 19:05.888
...on account of Maria being pregnant
but she lost that baby.

19:05.968 --> 19:08.224
And after that she suffered...

19:08.804 --> 19:13.050
...I don't know, half a dozen miscarriages
before she finally got Jonah.

19:15.192 --> 19:17.800
I see. I'm sorry to hear that.

19:18.180 --> 19:22.144
What about Jackson Pritchard
attracted her in the first place?

19:22.224 --> 19:25.507
He was an upright, churchgoing man.

19:25.587 --> 19:30.201
The Pritchards weren't rich,
but they owned their land outright.

19:31.459 --> 19:32.966
And...

19:33.655 --> 19:36.585
...she bought all that talk
about it being blessed and all.

19:36.665 --> 19:38.053
Blessed?

19:38.133 --> 19:41.383
Jonah was her reward from God...

19:41.463 --> 19:44.166
...for keeping the faith is what she said.

19:44.246 --> 19:46.795
Can you think of any reason
why your sister...

19:46.875 --> 19:49.635
...might take off somewhere and not tell you?

19:49.715 --> 19:51.664
Not a chance, no, she...

19:51.744 --> 19:54.837
...she told me if she changes the channel.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.674
And Jonah...

19:57.026 --> 20:00.776
- ...he likes staying here?
- Sure, we got a... we got a...

20:00.856 --> 20:04.546
...playground down the road,
a bunch of kids his age.

20:04.626 --> 20:08.737
I've even made him a little place
for him to sleep, you know, like a...

20:08.817 --> 20:11.987
...a little nook that he can...
he can make his own.

20:12.067 --> 20:13.722
Could I see it?

20:13.802 --> 20:17.014
Maria and me'd take my bed
and he'd sleep in there.

20:17.672 --> 20:21.310
- The closet?
- He preferred it to being out in the open.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.057
He said it made him feel safer.

20:59.781 --> 21:03.372
- That man is a monster!
- Grandma, you shouldn't be up.

21:03.452 --> 21:05.908
You ask him what he did.

21:05.988 --> 21:08.944
You ask him what he did
with Maria and little Jonah.

21:09.024 --> 21:11.080
- You ask him.
- It's okay. It's okay.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.682
If they die on that land...

21:13.762 --> 21:17.671
- ...their souls will never find rest.
- Nobody's died, okay?

21:17.751 --> 21:20.555
These people are here to help.
Don't you worry. Don't you worry.

21:20.635 --> 21:23.726
We're gonna...
we're gonna find Maria and Jonah.

21:24.006 --> 21:25.816
You are, aren't you?

21:32.980 --> 21:34.870
Doesn't leave us a whole
lot of options, does it?

21:34.950 --> 21:37.161
No. No, it doesn't.

21:37.618 --> 21:39.241
Wait.

21:39.321 --> 21:42.199
- What are you talkin' about?
- Get in.

21:44.925 --> 21:46.982
We have to check out Jackson Pritchard now.

21:47.062 --> 21:50.318
We've almost certainly got enough
probable cause for a search warrant...

21:51.313 --> 21:53.155
Ease it back there.

21:53.535 --> 21:55.991
Look, I agree that what Theresa
said raises some questions...

21:56.071 --> 21:58.260
...but I mean, I've already been out there.

21:58.340 --> 22:00.596
And the Sheriff was pretty clear
about leaving Jackson be for now.

22:00.676 --> 22:04.366
I think that we should look for
Maria's car and recheck the hospitals.

22:04.446 --> 22:07.639
Meanwhile, who knows what he
could be doing to Maria and her son.

22:07.719 --> 22:10.594
It's his son, too. Remember that.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.676
They've just been through some tough times.

22:14.756 --> 22:18.033
Economic hardship
does crazy things to people.

22:18.113 --> 22:22.552
I ran track with Jackson. He was always
serious, and more than a little weird...

22:23.632 --> 22:25.687
...but he's a good man
at his core. I know it.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.323
You heard what Ms. Locke said
about his abusive behavior.

22:28.403 --> 22:31.449
- Yeah, but...
- Look at this.

22:33.874 --> 22:37.833
Does that look like the work of a kid
who feels safe around his father?

22:37.913 --> 22:39.334
Shouldn't that be bagged for evidence?

22:39.414 --> 22:42.137
Whatever you think
you know about Pritchard...

22:42.217 --> 22:45.629
...could determine the fate
of two people, Deputy Salter.

23:02.837 --> 23:05.961
Okay, so the Pritchard place is way
out on the other side of the county...

23:06.041 --> 23:08.789
...but if we're not back right away,
the sheriff's gonna know something's up.

23:10.544 --> 23:12.768
If we do this, I gotta put a call in.

23:12.848 --> 23:14.937
You already know what he's gonna say.

23:15.617 --> 23:19.275
Haven't you ever heard it's easier to beg
for forgiveness than ask for permission?

23:19.855 --> 23:22.266
- I heard it the other way around.
- Still.

23:23.057 --> 23:26.348
- What are you gonna do when he tells you no?
- He's already told me no.

23:26.428 --> 23:30.512
We all know that I was called in
for a reason, your sheriff most of all.

23:30.592 --> 23:32.764
I'll take full responsibility.

23:54.722 --> 23:56.417
This is Pritchard's place.

23:58.526 --> 24:00.404
Stop the car.

24:10.805 --> 24:12.661
Is this Pritchard's?

24:13.141 --> 24:14.952
Not that I know of.

24:36.096 --> 24:38.053
The battery must be dead.

24:38.133 --> 24:41.990
Who abandons all their stuff in
an unlocked car and leaves the keys?

24:42.070 --> 24:43.881
It's a nice car.

25:34.288 --> 25:36.311
You guys go to the right place?

25:36.591 --> 25:39.270
Does this look normal to you?

25:40.261 --> 25:42.685
This is all new.

25:43.165 --> 25:45.409
It wasn't nearly this crazy three days ago.

25:47.618 --> 25:50.497
Stay here. I'll talk to him first.

25:56.877 --> 25:58.533
Gate's locked.

25:58.613 --> 26:01.824
Hey, Jackson! It's Colt Salter! You in there?

26:02.184 --> 26:04.261
I want to ask you a few questions.

26:05.486 --> 26:07.031
Jackson?

26:09.977 --> 26:13.837
Hey, I'm going around back. You wanna
grab a handheld from inside the glove box?

26:16.730 --> 26:19.362
- Radio check.
- Loud and clear.

27:20.661 --> 27:22.539
Son of a bitch.

27:24.532 --> 27:28.758
Unless you want that car to get
brain paint job, keep your hands up! Up!

27:28.838 --> 27:32.260
- Where I can see 'em. Come on. Get 'em up.
- I'm Special Agent Francis, Mr. Pritchard.

27:32.340 --> 27:34.496
You made a mistake coming here.

27:34.576 --> 27:39.256
I'm here investigating the disappearance
of your wife and son.

27:41.348 --> 27:45.059
You do want me to find them,
don't you, Mr. Pritchard?

27:48.188 --> 27:51.848
Well, they ain't in here.
So come on. Get walkin'.

27:51.928 --> 27:54.716
That's your wife's car,
isn't it, Mr. Pritchard?

27:54.796 --> 27:57.032
What's it doing here if you told
the police she went to her sister's?

27:57.112 --> 27:58.954
Shut up!

27:59.434 --> 28:02.291
Jackson, hey, don't do anything stupid.

28:02.871 --> 28:05.640
Although, I'd put threatening to shoot
a federal agent right up there with stupid.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.110
Both of you need to clear off my property,
right now!

28:08.190 --> 28:11.099
You know why we're here.
Give me the gun, we'll talk about it, okay?

28:11.179 --> 28:12.834
No, Colt!

28:12.914 --> 28:15.003
You take this woman and you leave.

28:15.483 --> 28:17.772
That's not gonna happen,
Mr. Pritchard. Not now.

28:17.852 --> 28:20.832
Jackson, she's right. Okay? Think about it.

28:21.122 --> 28:24.012
Now, I know you're not gonna shoot her
and you sure as heck not gonna shoot me...

28:24.092 --> 28:26.851
...but if you do, Gruenwell
will be here with the whole army.

28:26.931 --> 28:29.718
You remember when he caught us
TP-ing Jenny Ostlund's house?

28:29.798 --> 28:33.130
You'd have thought he had
Al Capone surrounded. Right?

28:36.070 --> 28:37.900
Hands on your head!

28:37.980 --> 28:40.428
- Hey.
- I said, hands on your head!

28:40.508 --> 28:44.112
- Easy with the gun, okay?
- Get on your knees!

28:44.212 --> 28:46.089
Cuff him.

28:46.794 --> 28:49.860
- I said, cuff him, Deputy Salter!
- Yes, ma'am.

28:52.219 --> 28:54.264
Where are they, Pritchard?

28:56.590 --> 28:59.448
They ain't here. That's the gospel truth.

29:00.128 --> 29:02.250
Her car is still on the property.

29:02.330 --> 29:05.409
We're 50 miles from nowhere.
They didn't just walk out of here.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.066
What the heck was that?

29:13.540 --> 29:17.032
I'm searching this house.
You keep an eye on this lying son of a bitch.

29:17.112 --> 29:20.435
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- I'm sure you don't want me to.

29:20.515 --> 29:23.238
You both need to clear off my property,
or as God is my witness...

29:23.318 --> 29:25.929
...I will not be responsible
for what happens!

29:27.421 --> 29:30.634
Colt, you... if she goes in there,
Maria and Jonah are as good as dead.

29:44.471 --> 29:46.528
Don't you mind my dog Earl.

29:47.208 --> 29:49.453
He's the least of your worries.

30:03.024 --> 30:05.068
Jesus Christ.

30:41.328 --> 30:43.140
The entryway looks clear.

31:01.648 --> 31:04.862
- I'm gonna check upstairs first.
- Okay, copy.

32:43.717 --> 32:45.940
<i>Deputy Salter, can you read me?</i>

32:46.020 --> 32:48.031
Not too clearly, no.

32:48.422 --> 32:50.234
<i>I'm heading downstairs.</i>

34:24.083 --> 34:26.096
<i>I'm checking down in the basement.</i>

34:27.554 --> 34:31.234
Agent Francis, I'm havin' a hard time
reading you. Do you read me? Over.

34:49.976 --> 34:51.299
What was that?

34:51.379 --> 34:54.489
Hey! You tell her to stop, alright?
You tell her to come back out right now!

35:44.684 --> 35:46.275
Down!

35:46.533 --> 35:48.623
Give me your hands.

35:48.703 --> 35:52.486
I told you not to do anything
stupid, Jackson. Not cool.

35:54.941 --> 35:57.245
Just a little hiccup. I got it under control.

35:57.325 --> 35:59.367
Get up. Come on.

35:59.747 --> 36:03.494
Mr. Pritchard, care to explain what exactly
you've got down there in the basement?

36:04.709 --> 36:06.311
You know...

36:06.708 --> 36:09.027
- ...in the cage?
- It's not them, is it?

36:09.107 --> 36:13.514
No, it's not a family member.
Although you tell me, Mr. Pritchard.

36:13.594 --> 36:15.616
Experiment with the livestock much?

36:15.776 --> 36:18.099
- You shut your mouth.
- Then tell me what it is!

36:18.179 --> 36:21.013
It is a servant of the beast.

36:21.614 --> 36:24.430
- A demon.
- A demon?

36:26.623 --> 36:29.414
You're not a church-going woman
to say it like that...

36:29.494 --> 36:31.846
...otherwise you'd know that the devil...

36:31.926 --> 36:35.219
...he used to be an angel until he
was cast out, and you'd know that...

36:35.299 --> 36:39.857
...sometimes you can't tell the difference
between a good angel and a fallen one.

36:39.937 --> 36:44.529
Whatever you do believe,
whatever you choose to call that...

36:44.609 --> 36:46.197
...it is evil.

36:46.277 --> 36:50.594
Yeah, one just like it took my wife and
son and I mean to use it to get my...

36:50.674 --> 36:52.686
...my family back.

36:52.766 --> 36:54.544
Took your wife and son?

36:56.035 --> 37:00.156
And you're holding that one hostage?

37:00.236 --> 37:03.044
- That's right.
- Will someone tell me what's goin' on?

37:03.124 --> 37:05.484
Mr. Pritchard here has some kind of...

37:05.564 --> 37:09.687
...deformed sickly wild animal
down there, in the cage.

37:09.767 --> 37:14.792
From where, I have no idea.
And what the hell is that lump of jelly?

37:14.872 --> 37:17.828
It was covered in it when I captured it...

37:17.908 --> 37:20.184
...and then it sloughed off
after a day or two.

37:20.264 --> 37:21.586
It was covered in it?

37:21.666 --> 37:25.557
Yeah, it was wearing it like...
some kind of skin or suit.

37:26.137 --> 37:29.133
You know any wild animals
that wear suits, lady?

37:29.213 --> 37:31.945
Okay, I don't know what kind of game
you're playing here Mr. Pritchard...

37:32.025 --> 37:35.403
...but spouting gibberish is not going to
absolve you of whatever responsibility...

37:35.483 --> 37:37.802
...you have in all of this.

37:37.882 --> 37:41.342
But I'll bite, how the hell...

37:41.422 --> 37:43.708
...did you even capture that thing?

37:43.788 --> 37:45.640
I ain't tellin' you shit.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.066
You are correct, sir.
You have the right to remain silent.

37:49.146 --> 37:52.950
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law...

37:53.030 --> 37:56.054
- You're arresting me? For what?
- You're kidding me, right?

37:56.134 --> 37:59.613
- Assault on a peace officer, for one.
- Make that two.

38:02.522 --> 38:04.400
Get in.

38:08.878 --> 38:10.134
My phone is dead.

38:10.214 --> 38:12.503
I'm not surprised,
you can't get a signal out here.

38:12.583 --> 38:15.862
No, it's completely bricked.

38:18.989 --> 38:20.719
Mine too.

38:21.259 --> 38:24.991
Okay. We better just transport him
and call it in from the road.

38:41.265 --> 38:42.300
Don't even tell me.

38:42.400 --> 38:45.538
This car was serviced last week.
There's no way the battery's dead.

38:46.870 --> 38:50.194
Hey! You brought this on yourself.
I tried to warn ya!

38:50.274 --> 38:54.687
And maybe someone tends' for me to stay.
Maybe that someone is ready to bargain.

39:00.850 --> 39:03.074
- Anything?
- No idea.

39:03.154 --> 39:06.177
It could be the battery. It could be the
starter. We'll have to take it apart to tell.

39:06.257 --> 39:09.502
- Like the car on the road.
- Yeah.

39:10.961 --> 39:13.452
The weirdness is startin'
to pile up around here.

39:14.232 --> 39:17.188
Jackson, how's your pick-up
running these days?

39:17.268 --> 39:20.338
I ordered parts to fix
that carburetor three months ago.

39:20.418 --> 39:21.459
Maria's car?

39:21.539 --> 39:24.095
She got the keys. So knock yourselves out!

39:24.978 --> 39:26.307
You stay here.

39:37.754 --> 39:40.870
Hey! Hey, you got to get me out of here!

39:49.499 --> 39:51.378
Her car is dead too.

39:54.003 --> 39:55.848
Oh, my God.

40:02.345 --> 40:03.534
Hey! Get me out of here!

40:03.614 --> 40:06.492
Inside the car
is the safest place you can be!

40:08.351 --> 40:10.650
I'll grab Pritchard.
You go to the front door!

40:13.356 --> 40:14.958
Come on.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.023
Colt! No!

40:34.978 --> 40:37.190
Get on your ass! Right now!

40:39.650 --> 40:42.862
You still insist there's
no greater hand in all this?

40:44.155 --> 40:47.311
- Where are your first aid supplies?
- In the drawer, next to the fridge.

40:47.391 --> 40:49.814
He moves, shoot him.

40:50.494 --> 40:53.284
You got yourself hooked up
with a live one, Colt?

40:53.364 --> 40:57.410
So what're you gonna do? Shoot me?
That's how it's gonna go? Like hell you will.

41:02.105 --> 41:04.662
I need to walk for help.

41:04.742 --> 41:07.360
The nearest farm is the homesteads.
It's 13 miles up the road.

41:07.440 --> 41:11.513
He's right. I don't recommend you go for a
hike in the dark when the storm's coming on.

41:11.593 --> 41:15.453
- I'm not staying here, that's for damn sure.
- It's not like they're gonna let you leave.

41:15.533 --> 41:19.176
- They're more active at night.
- I meant what I said before.

41:19.256 --> 41:21.592
The Sheriff will come lookin' for us
when we don't check in.

41:21.672 --> 41:23.948
Assuming he figures out where we are.

41:24.028 --> 41:26.317
I told you not to check in, remember?

41:26.397 --> 41:31.010
There's no telling how widespread this
storm is or if anyone can even get to us.

41:31.234 --> 41:32.744
Alright.

41:33.204 --> 41:37.441
You're gonna need stitches,
but this should hold. How is it?

41:37.521 --> 41:40.064
I could say I had worse, but I'd be lying.

41:40.144 --> 41:41.687
Did you see that out there?

41:42.747 --> 41:45.469
The lightning that didn't act like
any other lightning I'd ever seen before?

41:45.549 --> 41:48.773
No, and that last strike,
I thought I saw something...

41:48.853 --> 41:51.685
- ...right in the field where it hit.
- What?

41:52.065 --> 41:53.392
I don't know.

41:54.023 --> 41:55.880
Hey! Hey!

41:56.460 --> 41:58.482
- It's Maria! It's gotta be!
- Where?

41:58.562 --> 42:01.352
She's right there, right where
the lightning stroke in the field!

42:01.432 --> 42:04.822
- Come on! Get these things off me! Hurry up!
- No, you can show me with the cuffs on.

42:04.902 --> 42:08.126
- Hey, Deputy Salter, you stay here.
- Hold on. Hold on.

42:08.306 --> 42:09.779
Just in case.

42:18.414 --> 42:19.925
Maria!

42:23.419 --> 42:26.097
Maria! Maria! God!

42:26.177 --> 42:28.478
Maria. It's alright.

42:29.093 --> 42:32.604
Okay. Get this on her.
Where did she come from?

42:33.664 --> 42:35.786
No, no! Don't you touch her!

42:35.866 --> 42:38.789
I'm just gonna check her vitals. Okay?

42:38.869 --> 42:41.167
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:42.705 --> 42:45.564
- Is she...
- Yeah, she seems to be okay.

42:46.644 --> 42:50.089
Could you get these cuffs off me so
I can bring my wife back in my house?

42:50.797 --> 42:52.328
Please?

42:55.084 --> 42:56.958
Come on, baby. Get up.

42:58.122 --> 43:00.568
Do you... do you think
you can do me one more favor?

43:01.310 --> 43:03.286
- What?
- When we get back inside...

43:03.366 --> 43:07.385
...could you go to my wife's closet and
pick out something decent for her to wear?

43:07.865 --> 43:11.956
I'd hate for her to wake up wearing
something hideous that I'd pick for her.

43:12.336 --> 43:13.840
She'd kill me.

43:15.805 --> 43:17.316
Yeah.

43:20.710 --> 43:23.300
Hey, come on, wake up, Maria.

43:23.380 --> 43:26.829
Jackson? Hey. Come on.

43:28.952 --> 43:30.829
Come on.

43:32.889 --> 43:35.334
Hey. Hey.

43:37.660 --> 43:39.472
Where's Jonah?

43:42.365 --> 43:45.256
- He's not here.
- Oh, God.

43:46.036 --> 43:49.426
Oh, God! Oh, God. Oh, God!

43:49.506 --> 43:51.696
They've got their hands all over him.

43:52.376 --> 43:55.199
I can't move. I can't help him.

43:55.779 --> 43:57.495
He's just a little boy.

43:57.575 --> 43:59.167
Maria.

44:00.117 --> 44:04.331
It's Colt Salter. Can you tell me
where you were? Who you were with?

44:04.411 --> 44:07.044
Can't you see she needs a rest?
Why don't you just leave her be?

44:07.124 --> 44:09.202
This is all your fault!

44:10.326 --> 44:12.397
Our boy is gone 'cause of you!

44:12.897 --> 44:14.819
He's gone!

44:14.899 --> 44:16.420
Get away from me!

44:16.500 --> 44:18.856
You said everything would be alright!

44:19.436 --> 44:21.695
You said you'd fix it, but you couldn't!

44:22.939 --> 44:24.751
You better make this right.

44:25.909 --> 44:27.765
You get our boy back.

44:28.445 --> 44:30.868
He's the only good thing you ever did!

44:30.948 --> 44:33.269
You'd fix it?

44:33.349 --> 44:36.274
- What does that mean?
- Who are you?

44:36.354 --> 44:39.443
She's an FBI agent.
She's gonna help us find Jonah.

44:39.523 --> 44:44.704
Mrs. Pritchard, can you remember anything
that happened to you? How Jonah was taken?

44:45.195 --> 44:46.739
Taken?

44:49.165 --> 44:50.396
Taken?

44:51.801 --> 44:55.892
Why, Jackson gave our son
to those things. Didn't you, Jackson?

44:55.972 --> 44:59.418
- Don't.
- What things, Mrs. Pritchard?

45:00.643 --> 45:04.068
The angels his daddy
used to tell him about...

45:04.148 --> 45:07.758
...before that crazy old man
took off his own head with a shotgun.

45:07.838 --> 45:11.497
- Angels?
- The ones he said watch over this house.

45:12.822 --> 45:15.754
- Jackson actually called them down...
- Maria!

45:15.992 --> 45:18.437
No. No!

45:21.431 --> 45:23.471
Me and Jonah...

45:23.551 --> 45:25.889
...we had plans to go to my sister's...

45:25.969 --> 45:29.017
...but my little man, he got real sick.
He was burnin' up...

45:29.097 --> 45:30.628
Fine!

45:30.708 --> 45:33.731
You want to know?
You want to know everything?

45:34.511 --> 45:36.322
I'll tell you everything.

45:43.352 --> 45:45.786
You wouldn't pay for a doctor,
and now he's gonna die!

45:45.866 --> 45:47.520
Quiet!

45:51.461 --> 45:54.451
Lord of mercy, we turn to you
in this time of great need.

45:54.531 --> 45:56.809
- Jackson, this isn't right...
- Quiet!

46:03.106 --> 46:05.596
- Oh, my God!
- Keep your head down!

46:05.676 --> 46:07.286
Jonah!

46:21.424 --> 46:23.002
Maria?

46:25.495 --> 46:26.576
Maria!

46:29.498 --> 46:30.995
No!

46:31.903 --> 46:32.976
No!

47:02.098 --> 47:04.110
You took one of those things?

47:07.537 --> 47:09.682
Don't you understand?

47:10.339 --> 47:12.897
They're not angels.

47:13.177 --> 47:16.494
They've got Jonah! You're a fool, Jackson!

47:16.574 --> 47:18.702
- Maria! Hold on! Hold on!
- You're a fool!

47:18.782 --> 47:21.634
Was that the first time
you'd ever seen one of those creatures?

47:24.153 --> 47:26.642
Mr. Pritchard, this isn't a game.
Was that the first time you...

47:26.722 --> 47:28.479
No!

47:28.559 --> 47:30.314
It was not the first time.

47:30.394 --> 47:31.737
What?

47:32.829 --> 47:34.686
Then when was?

47:35.516 --> 47:37.605
Just after my daddy died.

47:38.135 --> 47:40.241
Right before me and Maria got married.

47:41.071 --> 47:43.928
I saw a light out in the field.

47:44.308 --> 47:46.319
And then, I was in the light.

47:47.343 --> 47:50.147
It was... it was like...

47:50.227 --> 47:51.935
...water...

47:52.015 --> 47:53.861
...bein' in water, only heavier.

47:54.351 --> 47:58.197
And then all of a sudden, I...
I was someplace else.

47:58.921 --> 48:02.178
I... I couldn't hardly see but...

48:02.776 --> 48:05.604
...I knew they were all around me...

48:06.229 --> 48:07.743
...just...

48:08.629 --> 48:10.524
...looking at me...

48:11.133 --> 48:13.958
...studying me like I was some...

48:14.738 --> 48:17.261
...kind of animal or...

48:17.341 --> 48:20.058
- ...some thing.
- Did they do anything to you?

48:20.878 --> 48:23.389
I don't know.

48:24.447 --> 48:26.209
I mean, I can't...

48:27.984 --> 48:29.695
I don't remember.

48:37.527 --> 48:39.539
Why you? Why here?

48:41.781 --> 48:44.109
If we knew what they were after...

48:47.336 --> 48:49.181
What was that noise?

48:50.439 --> 48:52.317
The cage.

48:57.413 --> 48:59.237
You really did it.

49:00.017 --> 49:01.828
It's one of them.

49:03.619 --> 49:06.098
- What's it doing?
- It's calling 'em.

49:07.056 --> 49:10.548
That's right! Yeah, you call,
but they can't help you!

49:11.628 --> 49:15.085
Not until my son is brought back to me
unharmed, you're gonna stay right there!

49:15.165 --> 49:16.753
Do you understand me?

49:16.833 --> 49:19.123
Jackson, I don't know
if you want to be doing that.

49:19.203 --> 49:21.859
Jackson, really.

49:22.139 --> 49:24.217
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

49:29.412 --> 49:30.923
Earl?

49:35.486 --> 49:37.057
They're inside.

49:37.587 --> 49:40.811
- I need to get the generator rolling.
- Generator? Why?

49:40.891 --> 49:43.914
The house is wired, electrified on the outside.
That should keep a couple from coming in.

49:43.994 --> 49:46.985
- You electrified our house?
- Yeah, and the lights too.

49:48.065 --> 49:50.354
That way we can at least see the bastards.

49:51.134 --> 49:52.756
The cars are dead.

49:52.836 --> 49:55.492
What makes you think
the generator is gonna work?

49:55.772 --> 49:57.582
Because it did before.

49:58.776 --> 50:02.200
Come on! You got to get me
out of these now! Now! Come on!

50:03.080 --> 50:05.291
- I'll go with him.
- Okay.

50:06.482 --> 50:09.428
- There you go. I'll stay with Maria.
- Okay. Hand me my keys.

50:33.743 --> 50:35.554
Fucking stuck.

51:04.707 --> 51:08.431
Hey, Colt, you don't want
to go walking out there, okay?

51:08.511 --> 51:11.324
Come on. Back inside. Come on. Back inside.

51:22.224 --> 51:24.069
Who's there?

51:25.795 --> 51:27.639
Deputy Salter?

51:28.798 --> 51:30.810
Pritchard! Is that you?

51:44.647 --> 51:46.692
Identify yourself.

52:32.929 --> 52:35.385
What happened? We heard shots!

52:35.465 --> 52:37.454
I shot one one of them.

52:37.534 --> 52:42.494
I... at least, I shot something.
I know I shot something, but it's gone.

52:42.574 --> 52:44.695
It's... it's just gone.

52:44.775 --> 52:46.597
Is ours still in the cage?

52:47.377 --> 52:50.181
- Yes or no, is it in the cage?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

52:50.261 --> 52:52.903
Okay. I can't imagine
they're gonna leave us alone now.

52:52.983 --> 52:55.535
I'd like to retrieve my shotgun
from your car...

52:55.615 --> 52:58.242
...go look for my dog
if that's okay with you.

52:59.022 --> 53:01.220
- Yeah, I... we'll cover you.
- Come on.

53:02.458 --> 53:04.915
Hey, Colt, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

53:04.995 --> 53:07.072
It's electrified now. Remember that.

53:20.142 --> 53:21.720
Earl!

53:28.317 --> 53:30.596
Earl! Come on, boy!

53:33.355 --> 53:34.867
Earl!

53:36.321 --> 53:38.922
- Earl!
- Jackson!

53:41.163 --> 53:44.955
No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

53:45.035 --> 53:46.816
Jesus.

53:51.774 --> 53:54.020
I don't even want to know what could do that.

53:59.915 --> 54:03.440
They think they can do whatever they want
to a man but they are not in charge!

54:03.520 --> 54:05.942
They are not! They're gonna see!
They're gonna see!

54:06.022 --> 54:07.244
Jackson!

54:07.324 --> 54:10.747
Dial it back a notch.
We'll get through this. You have my word.

54:10.827 --> 54:12.738
Your word, Colt?

54:14.363 --> 54:17.888
And you. You explain all that?

54:17.968 --> 54:21.413
You have no idea what you are dealing with!

54:30.146 --> 54:32.024
I'm sorry, I just get...

54:35.450 --> 54:37.975
...we're talking about my family, you know?

54:38.555 --> 54:40.195
I know.

54:44.510 --> 54:48.239
Well, we can at least be productive
while we're all sitting around here.

54:49.699 --> 54:54.157
Aside from the traps you set,
is the house itself as secure as it can be?

54:54.237 --> 54:57.327
That's a good idea.
Maria, take Agent Francis upstairs.

54:57.407 --> 55:00.016
Check the windows, throw furniture
anything you can against them.

55:00.096 --> 55:03.970
Me and Colt, we'll check the back.
Come on! Go!

55:06.148 --> 55:08.471
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

55:08.551 --> 55:10.496
I'm getting my son back.

55:20.062 --> 55:21.151
What the heck is that?

55:21.231 --> 55:23.653
My daddy used to keep
fighting dogs down here.

55:23.733 --> 55:27.177
He had to have a way to wrangle
the mutts without getting himself bit.

55:27.257 --> 55:29.960
What exactly are you planning on doing to it?

55:30.040 --> 55:34.585
I'm gonna show these sons of bitches
the concept of you mess with mine...

55:34.665 --> 55:37.723
- ...I will mess with yours.
- Hold on, hold on a second.

55:39.348 --> 55:41.560
Now, I don't know where this thing is from...

55:43.052 --> 55:46.889
...but it is one of God's creatures,
regardless. And it already looks...

55:46.969 --> 55:49.980
- ...it looks pretty sick.
- And thine eye shall not pity...

55:50.660 --> 55:53.650
...but life shall go for life,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth...

55:53.730 --> 55:56.319
...hand for hand, foot for foot.

55:56.399 --> 55:59.845
Now, step aside, Colt, or help me.

56:05.975 --> 56:07.486
Yeah.

56:08.677 --> 56:11.568
Now you herd him over to me
and I'm gonna hook him.

56:11.648 --> 56:14.571
Hey. Hit that side of the...
side of the cage.

56:14.651 --> 56:17.328
Come on, son of a bitch! Come on! Go!

56:18.255 --> 56:21.044
Come on. Go! Move!

56:21.897 --> 56:25.310
- Get him!
- Yeah, I got him! I got him! I got him!

56:28.698 --> 56:33.312
Hey! Colt, help me out with this!
Help me out! Come on! Pull it! Pull it!

56:49.986 --> 56:52.064
What the hell is going on?

56:55.991 --> 56:57.416
Stop!

57:02.699 --> 57:04.977
Do you know how insane this is?

57:07.436 --> 57:09.826
Maria came back where that lightning struck.

57:09.906 --> 57:12.963
There is something out there.
I intend to figure out what it is.

57:13.543 --> 57:16.233
You do want me to find my son
don't you, Agent Francis?

57:16.313 --> 57:18.301
Let him go!

57:18.381 --> 57:20.258
Just let the man go.

57:49.878 --> 57:52.925
- Jackson, what're you doing?
- This has got to be here.

57:54.350 --> 57:57.655
It's here. It's got to be here.
I know. I know it's here.

57:59.055 --> 58:00.399
What's here?

58:05.360 --> 58:07.439
Hey, Colt, give me your knife!

58:08.964 --> 58:12.355
- Colt, give me your knife!
- Okay. Okay. Here.

58:41.497 --> 58:43.341
That pattern...

58:44.299 --> 58:45.984
...I've seen it before.

59:21.170 --> 59:23.260
It's some kind of contact point.

59:23.640 --> 59:27.052
It's not a contact point!
It's there goddamned front door!

59:30.579 --> 59:32.057
Okay.

59:34.316 --> 59:37.554
Okay, we better reset your crossbow
and any other traps you might have.

59:37.634 --> 59:40.098
Nobody leaves the house until dawn.

59:43.926 --> 59:48.184
We know nothing, nothing about
the psychology of those things.

59:48.264 --> 59:50.640
At least I did something!
At least, I fought back!

59:50.720 --> 59:53.256
And who knows how they'll retaliate.

59:53.336 --> 59:55.739
As long as it gets my son back, I don't care.

59:55.819 --> 59:58.403
Okay, you were right.
Those things are not animals...

59:58.483 --> 01:00:01.698
...they are more, they are much, much more.

01:00:01.778 --> 01:00:05.335
And that disc out there is obviously
some kind of a teleportation...

01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:08.452
...a gateway, an advanced technology, right?

01:00:11.353 --> 01:00:13.209
Look at this.

01:00:13.289 --> 01:00:16.071
Your son... drew this.

01:00:19.695 --> 01:00:22.786
It's just like the design
on the disc out there.

01:00:22.866 --> 01:00:27.056
It's like a... a mapping system
or a circuit diagram, a network!

01:00:27.136 --> 01:00:31.761
- Come on. It's...
- Well, he clearly knew about them.

01:00:32.141 --> 01:00:34.764
Maybe that's why
they're so interested in him.

01:00:34.844 --> 01:00:38.090
My son draws crazy shit all the time! Look!

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:39.603
Look! Look!

01:00:39.883 --> 01:00:43.540
Mr. Pritchard, how did that thing
get out there in the first place?

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.843
Are there any more of them?

01:00:46.623 --> 01:00:50.635
How long has that thing been out there?
Do you have any answers, Mr. Pritchard?

01:01:08.143 --> 01:01:09.955
Look at this.

01:01:14.249 --> 01:01:16.221
It's your father, isn't it?

01:01:17.086 --> 01:01:19.966
- Yeah.
- Look really closely. Look behind him.

01:01:29.464 --> 01:01:31.343
He was working for 'em?

01:01:32.501 --> 01:01:35.225
I think there's gotta be
more to it than that.

01:01:35.305 --> 01:01:40.196
I'm no expert in agriculture but that land
out there does not look very productive.

01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:43.867
Yet your family held on to it
for generation after generation.

01:01:43.947 --> 01:01:45.875
Why is that?

01:01:46.215 --> 01:01:48.238
Tell them what he used to say to you.

01:01:48.918 --> 01:01:50.974
"Don't be like that idiot, Esau...

01:01:51.054 --> 01:01:53.899
"...and sell your birthright
just 'cause you're a little hungry.

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:59.816
"Someday, we shall reap God's
harvest from this patch of Earth.

01:02:00.496 --> 01:02:02.454
It is promised to us."

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.444
He drummed that into me...

01:02:07.736 --> 01:02:09.614
...without mercy.

01:02:12.174 --> 01:02:15.732
He said that my great-great-grandfather...

01:02:15.812 --> 01:02:17.870
...was led here by the Lord.

01:02:21.249 --> 01:02:23.073
He said it in his own way.

01:02:23.753 --> 01:02:25.642
I never thought...

01:02:25.922 --> 01:02:27.536
...I never dreamed...

01:02:27.616 --> 01:02:30.365
...that it meant all this.

01:02:30.992 --> 01:02:32.804
All of this.

01:02:36.365 --> 01:02:38.410
Of course, my daddy had his way out.

01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:50.433
If we don't want that to happen again,
we need to get to the bottom of this.

01:02:50.513 --> 01:02:54.382
And the key to that
and to finding your son...

01:02:55.383 --> 01:02:58.463
...is downstairs in the basement.

01:03:23.345 --> 01:03:25.970
It was obviously wearing that for protection.

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:29.439
I wonder how long it can survive without it.

01:03:29.919 --> 01:03:33.332
If we're gonna have any chance
of trading it for your son...

01:03:33.412 --> 01:03:36.412
- ...we need to make sure...
- Well, this thing can't fucking die...

01:03:36.492 --> 01:03:39.538
...until I say it can.
Now come on! Get up! Come on!

01:04:07.956 --> 01:04:09.347
Come on!

01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:20.438
They threw me away.

01:04:23.638 --> 01:04:26.084
- What?
- They made this body...

01:04:27.809 --> 01:04:30.151
And then they destroyed Jackson.

01:04:32.615 --> 01:04:34.626
What does that even mean?

01:04:35.283 --> 01:04:37.161
It means...

01:04:38.186 --> 01:04:40.268
...my husband is dead.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:45.070
I suspected that he was different
for a long time that...

01:04:46.661 --> 01:04:49.708
...that the man I fell in love with
isn't the one I married, but...

01:04:52.367 --> 01:04:54.179
...those are crazy thoughts, right?

01:04:57.139 --> 01:04:58.750
Not so crazy now.

01:04:59.875 --> 01:05:01.791
The worst part is...

01:05:01.871 --> 01:05:04.356
...he had me believing it was my fault.

01:05:06.781 --> 01:05:08.859
It was you!

01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:11.874
It was you all along...

01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:13.812
...you goddamn monster!

01:05:16.275 --> 01:05:18.119
What did he do?

01:05:20.062 --> 01:05:21.956
What did he do?

01:05:24.733 --> 01:05:26.344
I'll show you.

01:05:40.282 --> 01:05:42.160
Go ahead, Agent.

01:05:43.318 --> 01:05:45.162
Have a look.

01:05:46.021 --> 01:05:47.865
Oh, my God.

01:05:51.893 --> 01:05:53.783
All those years...

01:05:54.363 --> 01:05:56.219
...of shame of...

01:05:56.599 --> 01:05:58.676
...of trying to hide it.

01:06:00.802 --> 01:06:03.660
He wouldn't even let me
give them a proper burial.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.622
He said that they were abominations
before the Lord.

01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:16.594
- They're replacing us.
- You're saying Pritchard's one of them?

01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:25.148
I've had you over to my house
and you fooled us all!

01:06:25.228 --> 01:06:27.672
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:33.893
How is this possible? How could you not know?

01:06:33.973 --> 01:06:37.182
It wanted me to know why I was here.

01:06:40.341 --> 01:06:42.186
They gotta change...

01:06:43.912 --> 01:06:45.401
...to adapt to life here.

01:06:45.481 --> 01:06:48.138
The new ones, they can't be mules.

01:06:49.118 --> 01:06:51.363
They gotta be able to breed true.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:56.801
You see, their world is dying.

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:02.266
They're just running out of time
to get it right.

01:07:06.117 --> 01:07:09.725
- What about Jonah?
- Jonah's so important.

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:13.919
He's the first natural-born.

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:17.388
He's the future.

01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:23.272
- He's their future.
- What about our future?

01:07:23.352 --> 01:07:25.625
- Hey. Colt!
- What about our future?

01:07:25.705 --> 01:07:28.145
Colt! Back off!

01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:32.649
I need you to go upstairs right now
and make sure that the house is secure.

01:07:33.229 --> 01:07:36.585
Why? If those things wanna get in here
there's nothing we can do about it.

01:07:36.665 --> 01:07:38.721
- You've seen what they can do.
- It's not easy for them...

01:07:38.801 --> 01:07:41.023
...or they would've done it already.

01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:44.393
We just need to be able
to hang on until morning.

01:07:44.473 --> 01:07:46.729
For what? For Jonah?

01:07:46.809 --> 01:07:48.853
The kid is one of those things!

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.870
It's them.

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:57.173
- They're coming.
- Focus.

01:07:57.253 --> 01:07:59.275
We need to hold it together.

01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:04.714
There is every possibility
that Jonah is completely normal.

01:08:04.794 --> 01:08:07.639
- We don't have all the evidence yet.
- Evidence?

01:08:09.531 --> 01:08:11.654
Who cares about evidence?

01:08:11.734 --> 01:08:14.223
We're done. Don't you see that?

01:08:14.703 --> 01:08:17.359
We are at the Little Bighorn
and the Indians are circling...

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:20.719
...and they are gonna do more than scalp us.

01:08:23.044 --> 01:08:25.348
I just know that I can't go out like that.

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:31.162
Then don't.

01:08:32.854 --> 01:08:34.933
We have to hold the line here.

01:08:36.358 --> 01:08:37.906
You and me.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.518
There's nobody else left to do it.

01:08:42.198 --> 01:08:44.109
And nobody who would believe it.

01:08:48.937 --> 01:08:50.715
To protect and serve.

01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:54.417
To protect and serve.

01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:32.135
Okay.

01:09:32.715 --> 01:09:35.504
We're gonna get your son back.
It's time to negotiate.

01:09:35.584 --> 01:09:39.008
Give them what they want
and we might all get out of this alive.

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:42.348
You call this... this being alive?

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:45.548
I'm a goddamn lie.
I don't even know what the fuck I am!

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:47.616
Well, you call it a soul...

01:09:47.696 --> 01:09:50.508
...or whatever you like but...

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:54.557
...there is more Jackson Pritchard
left inside there than they counted on.

01:09:54.737 --> 01:09:56.948
Maybe that was the case with your father.

01:09:58.273 --> 01:10:00.162
Maybe that's why he took his own life.

01:10:00.242 --> 01:10:04.400
They've been using us lab rats,
my whole family, for generations.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.436
From where I stand, you're human...

01:10:07.516 --> 01:10:11.541
...and you have been fighting like hell
this whole time to protect your family.

01:10:12.121 --> 01:10:14.774
That counts for something.
Don't stop now. Your son needs you.

01:10:14.854 --> 01:10:18.147
You been listening to anything I said?
My son is one of them!

01:10:18.227 --> 01:10:20.868
We won't know for sure
until we get him back safe...

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:23.525
...and that is the only way.

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:17.461
Please.

01:11:18.846 --> 01:11:21.678
If my Jackson is still in there somewhere...

01:11:22.758 --> 01:11:25.408
...the man I fell in love with,
I'm begging you.

01:11:26.262 --> 01:11:28.684
Jonah is all that I got left.

01:11:29.264 --> 01:11:31.354
Mr. Pritchard, we need your help.

01:11:32.434 --> 01:11:35.447
You have to decide.
Colt can't hold them off forever.

01:13:03.324 --> 01:13:06.748
You know, this thing is so sick
and fragile. I want to wrap it up.

01:13:06.828 --> 01:13:09.518
Agent, give me that tarp. It's right there
on my drill press right there.

01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:12.621
Maria, come on inside here, come here.
Come on! Hurry up, now.

01:13:12.701 --> 01:13:16.428
Come on, put these on. Put those on.
Come on over here. Come on.

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.684
Agent!

01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:24.354
- What are you doing?
- Not a word!

01:13:38.393 --> 01:13:41.039
I'm gonna end this tonight. You'll see.

01:13:44.732 --> 01:13:46.011
Oh, my God.

01:14:51.933 --> 01:14:53.511
Yes!

01:15:13.187 --> 01:15:14.912
Jackson took it.

01:15:18.192 --> 01:15:20.037
My babies...

01:15:20.795 --> 01:15:22.673
...they're all gone.

01:15:25.833 --> 01:15:27.785
I'm scared of what he's gonna do.

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.282
I'll get Jonah back.

01:16:13.014 --> 01:16:14.459
Colt.

01:16:17.385 --> 01:16:19.230
I'm sorry.

01:16:50.551 --> 01:16:53.431
Stop! Put down the gun, Mr. Pritchard!

01:16:55.356 --> 01:16:58.597
No! This ends here.

01:16:58.677 --> 01:17:00.516
The bloodline ends here.

01:17:01.196 --> 01:17:04.653
- You can't be certain that he's one of them.
- I am certain!

01:17:04.733 --> 01:17:08.390
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, Daddy, please, please...

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:10.279
He's still your son, Mr. Pritchard.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:13.753
Whatever they've done to you,
whatever they've done to your family...

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:16.265
- ...you can't do this.
- Please! Let go! You're hurting me.

01:17:16.345 --> 01:17:20.219
- This is for the best, boy.
- Don't make me shoot, Mr. Pritchard.

01:17:20.649 --> 01:17:22.292
Please.

01:17:25.687 --> 01:17:27.531
God help us all.

01:17:40.334 --> 01:17:42.580
Jonah! Get over here!

01:17:48.943 --> 01:17:50.687
Drop it!

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.204
- Come here, baby.
- What're you gonna do now, Mrs. Pritchard?

01:17:56.284 --> 01:17:59.474
I'm gonna make sure nobody
takes my boy away from me again.

01:17:59.554 --> 01:18:01.343
I don't want to take him away from you.

01:18:01.423 --> 01:18:04.513
You government types talk out
of both sides of your mouth!

01:18:04.593 --> 01:18:07.647
You'll take him and you'll lock him up
in a lab somewhere!

01:18:09.197 --> 01:18:11.000
Don't you even want to know what he is?

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.881
No! He's my son...

01:18:14.519 --> 01:18:16.258
...and he's perfect!

01:18:16.338 --> 01:18:18.783
I'm not gonna let you destroy that.

01:18:58.946 --> 01:19:00.579
Mommy!

01:19:31.312 --> 01:19:33.402
Hush now, baby.

01:19:34.582 --> 01:19:36.271
It's okay.

01:19:36.351 --> 01:19:38.540
You're back with Mama.

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.065
Nobody is gonna hurt you.

01:19:47.061 --> 01:19:49.687
Sometimes God alone just isn't enough.

01:19:51.298 --> 01:19:54.745
You'll do whatever you have to
to protect your child.

01:19:59.407 --> 01:20:01.698
You can't stop what's happening.

01:20:02.778 --> 01:20:05.189
Just like you can't stop a mother's love.

01:20:08.849 --> 01:20:10.695
My boy is home.

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:14.465
That's all that matters.

01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:37.447
So...

01:20:37.527 --> 01:20:40.368
...Maria Pritchard confirms
a lot of what's in your report...

01:20:40.448 --> 01:20:43.246
About how she shot her husband
when he tried to kill the boy.

01:20:44.086 --> 01:20:47.777
And I'm inclined to believe the both
of you that it was justifiable homicide.

01:20:48.757 --> 01:20:53.002
You see what he did
to that house and... and Colt.

01:20:53.961 --> 01:20:57.820
And the crater is
a man-made bomb left out there.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.222
Not enough left of him to fill a thimble.

01:21:00.302 --> 01:21:02.290
What bomb?

01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:04.513
And I never said that he killed Colt.

01:21:05.273 --> 01:21:06.762
Come on.

01:21:06.842 --> 01:21:09.264
She also gives you quite a bit of credit...

01:21:09.344 --> 01:21:13.202
...for launching the assault
that got them free from that lunatic.

01:21:14.282 --> 01:21:18.502
What? No. I didn't launch an assault and...

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:21.042
...he wasn't holding them hostage.

01:21:21.122 --> 01:21:25.747
Agent Francis, if you insist on holding on
to this fairy tale about men from Mars...

01:21:25.827 --> 01:21:27.696
I never called them that.

01:21:27.776 --> 01:21:30.419
It's gonna cost you your career.

01:21:30.499 --> 01:21:32.921
And I shouldn't have to remind you
that in our line of work...

01:21:33.001 --> 01:21:37.659
...we are limited to only telling those
stories which we can actually prove.

01:21:37.739 --> 01:21:42.330
Right? I've laid out the facts as I see them
as any rational person could see them...

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:44.923
...and there's absolutely
no evidence to the contrary.

01:21:45.003 --> 01:21:47.515
- Well, did you check the basement?
- There's nothing there.

01:21:47.595 --> 01:21:51.139
The cage. There has to be DNA in there.
If you conduct a sweep...

01:21:51.219 --> 01:21:54.309
I don't have the manpower
or the resources for that nonsense.

01:21:54.389 --> 01:21:56.838
It's over. The case is closed.

01:21:56.918 --> 01:21:59.948
Pritchard was clearly a psycho.

01:22:00.028 --> 01:22:03.518
Who became completely unhinged
in the last couple of days.

01:22:03.598 --> 01:22:05.887
He had us all fooled. Look at this place!

01:22:05.967 --> 01:22:09.580
And I'm saying that your initial
suspicions were right, by the way.

01:22:12.306 --> 01:22:15.364
I don't care about being right.

01:22:16.144 --> 01:22:19.567
We can't just sit back
and ignore the implications.

01:22:19.647 --> 01:22:24.540
Is this normal to you, the temperature
dropping 30 degrees in five minutes?

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.109
Multiple lightning strikes in the same place!

01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:31.880
Listen to me. You're gonna do whatever
you're gonna do, you've proven that...

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.982
...but take my advice...

01:22:34.062 --> 01:22:37.219
...and forget this alien invasion
taking over the world crap.

01:22:37.299 --> 01:22:41.972
All you're gonna get for your trouble
is a rubber room and a lithium drip.

01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:44.960
I know what I saw.

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:49.331
The local Indians have been telling us
stories of spirits and demons...

01:22:49.411 --> 01:22:51.900
...on this land for generations.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.882
Yours wouldn't be
the first one, Agent Francis.

01:22:58.185 --> 01:22:59.997
You had it wrong, Colt.

01:23:01.222 --> 01:23:04.013
It turns out we're the Indians
this time around.

01:23:04.693 --> 01:23:06.503
What was that?

01:23:07.411 --> 01:23:09.885
Just something Deputy Salter said.

01:23:10.515 --> 01:23:13.992
You know, my father used to brag
about being 1/16 Cherokee.

01:23:17.271 --> 01:23:19.927
Do you think in 100 years any of them will...

01:23:20.675 --> 01:23:24.333
...be proud to be 1/16th us?

01:23:24.913 --> 01:23:26.790
Take care of yourself now.

01:23:28.315 --> 01:23:30.171
You too, Sheriff.

01:23:30.251 --> 01:23:32.129
And I really mean that.

01:23:54.775 --> 01:23:56.697
There's no smoking in here, ma'am.

01:24:33.497 --> 01:24:36.522
<i>Is death preferable to knowing
what I know now?</i>

01:24:37.352 --> 01:24:43.411
<i>Maybe. Maybe even worse is the prospect
of telling this story over and over...</i>

01:24:43.491 --> 01:24:45.781
<i>...knowing no one will ever believe me.</i>

01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:50.085
<i>Knowing it'll be dismissed
as easily as the scribblings...</i>

01:25:54.862 --> 01:25:55.863
Jonah!

01:25:57.332 --> 01:26:00.144

The harvest.

01:26:58.525 --> 01:27:00.404
