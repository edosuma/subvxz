00:04.537 --> 00:06.672
        A little bit more to the
              left there, Woody.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.841
Yeah, ah, perfect.              

00:08.908 --> 00:10.009
Good, good.                     

00:10.076 --> 00:11.210
                 How's that?    
Nice.                           

00:14.881 --> 00:16.782
        (laughing)              

00:16.850 --> 00:20.152
            A little bit more to
                the right, Wood!

00:20.220 --> 00:21.353
Yeah. Ah, ah, ah.               
                      Yeah.     

00:21.421 --> 00:22.621
                     Good!      
There you go!                   

00:22.689 --> 00:23.756
          How's that?           

00:23.823 --> 00:25.624
     Perfect!                   

00:26.726 --> 00:29.028
                        Well,   

00:29.095 --> 00:30.396
              about six or eight
                     inches more

00:30.463 --> 00:31.630
                    to the right
                    there, Wood!

00:31.698 --> 00:32.798
          How's that?           

00:32.866 --> 00:33.966
Yeah,                           

00:34.034 --> 00:35.234
                perfect.        

00:39.105 --> 00:40.773
You guys ain't even close.      

00:40.840 --> 00:42.141
Uh, you know,                   

00:42.208 --> 00:44.943
I think maybe we need           
a-a taller building.            

00:45.011 --> 00:46.645
What about the Prudential Tower?

00:46.713 --> 00:48.180
      Perfect!                  

00:50.216 --> 00:53.185
      See you over there.       

00:53.253 --> 00:55.954

01:11.504 --> 01:15.541

01:16.676 --> 01:19.545

02:10.997 --> 02:12.898
      Good afternoon, all!      

02:12.966 --> 02:13.966
                  Shut the door!

02:14.034 --> 02:14.933
              Why?              

02:15.001 --> 02:16.602
                 To keep out the
                    bitter cold.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.505
Too late.                       

02:19.572 --> 02:20.939
She got in.                     

02:21.007 --> 02:23.075
            Oh, I sense the mood
                     of the bar.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.277
    You're all suffering from   
            the winter blues,   

02:25.345 --> 02:26.845
the shortened                   
daylight hours,                 

02:26.913 --> 02:29.648
the cold numbing weather,       
 the bleak sense of isolation.  

02:29.716 --> 02:31.684
It's what we in the psychiatric 
        profession call,        

02:31.751 --> 02:33.118
          the jackpot!          

02:34.854 --> 02:36.522
    Frasier and I have          
        a wonderful plan        

02:36.589 --> 02:37.856
to lift our spirits.            

02:37.924 --> 02:39.892
  What, are you gonna buy some  
     toys and canned goods      

02:39.993 --> 02:41.593
        and hand 'em out        
    to underprivileged kids?    

02:41.661 --> 02:43.595
                    Well, no.   

02:43.663 --> 02:46.231
             We're checking into
              a luxury hotel for
              a getaway weekend,

02:46.299 --> 02:47.666
             just the two of us.

02:47.734 --> 02:48.901
                     Oh.        

02:48.968 --> 02:51.236
    Well, that'll make          
      some bellboys happy.      

02:52.939 --> 02:55.007
      So, aren't you gonna      
         bring the kid?         

02:55.075 --> 02:57.276
  Well, we would, but we find   
  that we make better parents   

02:57.344 --> 02:58.711
    if we occasionally          
          take a break          

02:58.778 --> 03:00.679
    from our parenting          
    responsibilities.           

03:00.747 --> 03:03.015
      Hey, you don't have       
      to justify it to me.      

03:03.083 --> 03:05.017
  You know, my parents ran off  
        for a year              

03:05.085 --> 03:07.019
 with the Pentecostal caravan.  

03:07.087 --> 03:08.854
                    Oh, sure,   

03:08.922 --> 03:11.890
they called once in a while, but
 they were speaking in tongues. 

03:11.958 --> 03:13.492
                        Yeah.   

03:13.560 --> 03:16.495
      It was just by chance that
          they came back at all.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.199
              Sam!              

03:20.266 --> 03:21.467
What are you doing?!            

03:21.534 --> 03:22.568
          I'm working.          

03:22.669 --> 03:24.003
     What does it look like     
        I'm doing?              

03:24.070 --> 03:26.005
Well, excuse me,                
but this is the 12th!           

03:26.072 --> 03:27.973
              Yeah. Well, I work
                    on the 12th.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.142
  Well I ovulate on the 12th!   

03:32.245 --> 03:34.513
              How was I supposed
                to know that?   

03:34.581 --> 03:35.481
                 We all knew it.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.216
                     It's in the
                     newsletter.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.818
Sam, just finish up             
whatever you're doing,          

03:39.886 --> 03:41.153
and let's                       
get pregnant.                   

03:41.221 --> 03:43.155
    Boy, that's what I like     
         about Rebecca.         

03:43.223 --> 03:45.557
  She's just an old-fashioned   
        girl, isn't she?        
                            Mmm.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.526
You cannot order me             
to perform!                     

03:47.594 --> 03:49.895
I don't want to have sex        
with you, okay? No sex.         

03:49.963 --> 03:51.864
Who said that?                  

03:51.931 --> 03:53.565
        I don't believe this.   

03:53.633 --> 03:55.534
If we don't do it now we have   
          to wait a whole month!

03:55.602 --> 03:57.069
      I'm not in the mood,      
        all right?              

03:57.137 --> 03:58.971
Who's saying                    
these things?                   

03:59.039 --> 04:01.006
              Sam, what is wrong
                    with you?   

04:01.074 --> 04:02.041
I don't know.                   

04:02.108 --> 04:03.509
 Boy, you two sure argue a lot  

04:03.576 --> 04:04.777
              for two people who
                  aren't in love

04:04.844 --> 04:06.445
                but want to have
                         a baby.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.213
  I mean, I don't know, maybe   
  that's normal for two people  

04:08.281 --> 04:09.882
    who aren't in love          
    but want to have a baby.    

04:11.317 --> 04:12.584
        I wouldn't know.        
    I've never known anyone     

04:12.652 --> 04:14.253
    who wasn't in love          
but wanted to have a baby.      

04:14.320 --> 04:15.587
        Woody, shut up!         

04:15.655 --> 04:18.589
        Hey, don't get me caught
            in your sick web.   

04:20.660 --> 04:23.595
Come here, come here, hey,      
just-just relax.                

04:23.663 --> 04:25.064
            Remember            
     what the doctor said?      

04:25.131 --> 04:27.232
You know, how stress can        
keep you from conceiving.       

04:27.300 --> 04:29.568
Well, all-all we do             
nowadays is fight.              

04:29.636 --> 04:30.469
          Oh, shut up!          
No, you shut up!                

04:30.537 --> 04:31.603
                No, you shut up!
You shut up!                    

04:31.671 --> 04:33.605
Shut me up!                     
                     (shouting):
                        Shut up!

04:36.509 --> 04:37.543
     This is what               
     I'm talking about.         

04:37.610 --> 04:38.711
        This is stress.         

04:38.778 --> 04:40.279
        Oh, yeah?               
  Well, you've got ten minutes  

04:40.347 --> 04:42.281
  to get yourself together and  
 get your bad attitude in order 

04:42.349 --> 04:43.749
    and get over to my place    

04:43.817 --> 04:46.285
  and we're gonna make a cute   
          little baby!          

04:46.353 --> 04:48.253
          I hate her.           

04:49.823 --> 04:51.757
         Now, at 2:00,          
        we have a choice        

04:51.825 --> 04:53.759
      between a sumptuous       
            high tea            

04:53.827 --> 04:56.028
         and a relaxing         
        Swedish massage.        

04:56.096 --> 04:57.329
    Ah, 2:00.                   

04:57.397 --> 04:58.931
Right about then I'll be jumping
into my mail truck,             

04:58.998 --> 05:00.099
ripping off my shoes            

05:00.166 --> 05:01.767
and trying to save my toes      
from frostbite.                 

05:01.835 --> 05:03.769
              Hey, nobody held a
                gun to your head

05:03.837 --> 05:06.338
                and said, "Be   
                     a mailman."

05:06.406 --> 05:08.474
  Frasier, we have a problem.   

05:08.541 --> 05:09.842
            I've just gotten off

05:09.909 --> 05:11.377
        the phone               
with Frederick's teacher,       

05:11.444 --> 05:13.379
         who informs me         
  that your son has come down   

05:13.446 --> 05:14.780
  with a case of chicken pox.   

05:14.848 --> 05:17.116
     No! I'm not giving up      
        my nonrefundable        

05:17.183 --> 05:18.751
        getaway weekend!        

05:18.818 --> 05:20.419
                Frasier, your   
                child is ill.   

05:20.487 --> 05:22.421
    (sighing)                   

05:22.489 --> 05:24.556
Oh, you're right,               
of course you're right.         

05:24.624 --> 05:25.991
I'm-I'm ashamed.                

05:26.059 --> 05:26.992
              And deservedly so.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.961
                 Shall we?      

05:29.029 --> 05:30.963
         I'm on my way.         

05:31.031 --> 05:32.965
         Well, friends,         
I've discovered a new way       

05:33.033 --> 05:34.967
of getting over the winter      
             blues.             

05:35.035 --> 05:37.302
      Instead of enjoying       
        a luxury weekend        

05:37.370 --> 05:39.338
         being coddled          
     in a four-star hotel,      

05:39.406 --> 05:40.539
I'll be bathing                 
an itchy,                       

05:40.607 --> 05:43.575
whiney two-year old             
in oatmeal.                     

05:43.643 --> 05:44.877
                  Say, Fras, uh,
                    you know,   

05:44.944 --> 05:46.745
     if you have trouble getting
        rid of that reservation,

05:46.813 --> 05:49.348
     I sure know a couple who've
      been under a lot of stress

05:49.416 --> 05:50.616
                  and fighting a
                     lot lately,

05:50.684 --> 05:52.351
    and, you know, they could   
                 benefit from a,

05:52.419 --> 05:54.186
                  a nice weekend
                     in a hotel.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.321
Thanks for thinking             
of us, Sammy.                   
                         Yeah.  

05:57.557 --> 05:59.124
              Listen, uh, I just
                 got to run home

05:59.192 --> 06:00.325
            and get my travel   
                iron real quick.

06:00.393 --> 06:01.593
I'm not talking about you guys. 

06:01.661 --> 06:02.594
      I'm talking about me      
          and Rebecca.          

06:02.662 --> 06:03.629
Yeah, stupid.                   

06:03.697 --> 06:04.863
You should have                 
thought of that.                

06:04.931 --> 06:06.632
            You made the same   
                mistake, pal.   

06:06.700 --> 06:08.667
Boy, we-we                      

06:08.735 --> 06:10.602
really could have used          
that weekend.                   

06:12.005 --> 06:13.605
Come on,                        
what do you say, huh?           

06:13.673 --> 06:15.274
     Please?                    

06:15.342 --> 06:16.475
                  Oh, all right.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.510
            Here, take the room.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.945
            Conceive your child.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.447
                        Go make.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.616
             Well, yeah, doesn't
                it at least make
                 you feel better

06:24.684 --> 06:26.318
              knowing somebody's
                     having fun?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.686
              No.               

06:29.089 --> 06:31.190
    I know it sounds petty,     
         but frankly I,         

06:31.257 --> 06:33.692
I can't think of anything       
 that would make me feel worse. 

06:33.760 --> 06:36.362
    Uh, Frasier, dear,          

06:36.429 --> 06:38.030
I can't remember.               

06:38.098 --> 06:39.865
Have you ever had               
the chicken pox?                

06:39.933 --> 06:41.166
FRASIER:                        
Oh!                             

06:41.234 --> 06:43.502
I can always think of something 

06:43.570 --> 06:45.504
that would make him feel worse. 

06:52.912 --> 06:54.480
        Hey, everybody.         

06:55.815 --> 06:57.649
      Woody, uh, set me up      
     with a beer, will you?     

06:57.717 --> 06:59.852
 Well, aren't you gonna finish  
  your mail route, Mr. Clavin?  

06:59.919 --> 07:01.186
        Are you kidding?        

07:01.254 --> 07:02.921
     There's too much snow      
      and sleet out there.      

07:05.792 --> 07:07.993
            Besides it's getting
                  a little dark.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.829
I don't blame you,              
Cliff,                          

07:10.897 --> 07:12.231
I hate going out                
in this weather.                

07:12.298 --> 07:14.566
Hmm. Yeah, you guys are a bunch 
          of whining,           

07:14.634 --> 07:16.235
      complaining weenies.      

07:16.302 --> 07:18.504
         What, you like         
         this weather?          

07:18.571 --> 07:20.506
     Oh, is that the topic?     

07:21.808 --> 07:23.642
  Well, are we gonna let this   
    weather defeat us?          

07:23.710 --> 07:25.244
  Or are we gonna fight back?   

07:25.311 --> 07:26.345
Hey, I'm with you, Doc.         

07:26.413 --> 07:27.780
So what shall we do?            

07:27.847 --> 07:29.148
Hey, you guys                   
ever hear                       

07:29.215 --> 07:30.916
of something called             
the Polar Bear Club?            

07:30.984 --> 07:32.084
        Uh...                   

07:32.152 --> 07:33.452
                        PAUL:   
            Well, it's great.   

07:33.520 --> 07:35.154
 We used to do it all the time  
        where I grew up.        

07:35.221 --> 07:36.588
Bunch of guys get in their cars.

07:36.656 --> 07:37.823
 They drive down to the ocean.  

07:37.891 --> 07:38.957
        They strip down         
    to their skivvies           

07:39.025 --> 07:40.259
    and they run right          
        into the water.         

07:40.326 --> 07:44.196
Uh, I was thinking more         
of a, uh, belching contest.     

07:45.832 --> 07:47.666
        Oh, I don't know, uh,   
             loudest or longest?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.568
PAUL:                           
Fine. Fine,                     

07:49.636 --> 07:51.003
    but you guys don't know     
      what you're missing.      

07:51.071 --> 07:53.205
     Now, when we were kids     
we didn't care if it was January

07:53.273 --> 07:55.274
  or February, we just jumped   
    in that ocean and swam.     

07:55.342 --> 07:56.642
                  It felt great.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.610
It was like we scored one       
against winter.                 

07:58.678 --> 08:00.612
    Hey, if it's good enough    
    for Mr. Krapence.           

08:00.680 --> 08:02.214
  Well, are we up to it, men?   

08:02.282 --> 08:03.916
                      All right.
Well, uh, well,                 
it's one of the earthly thrills 

08:03.983 --> 08:05.884
I haven't tried yet.            
                    Let's do it!

08:05.952 --> 08:08.954
        GUYS (chanting):        
    Polar Bear! Polar Bear!     

08:09.022 --> 08:11.357
    Polar Bear! Polar Bear!     

08:11.424 --> 08:13.959
    Polar Bear! Polar Bear!     

08:14.027 --> 08:15.294
Polar Bear...                   

08:15.362 --> 08:17.463
So, Paul, where were you        
brought up?                     

08:17.530 --> 08:19.298
                    Honolulu.   

08:29.843 --> 08:31.477
             Whoa!              

08:31.544 --> 08:34.246
          Three bucks           
    for a lousy pack of gum.    

08:34.313 --> 08:36.914
                        REBECCA:
              Sam, get away from
                  the honor bar.

08:36.982 --> 08:38.250
        Honor bar.              

08:38.318 --> 08:40.251
              Oh.               

08:47.727 --> 08:49.695
        Hey, sweetheart,        
    what do you think?          

08:50.764 --> 08:53.966
 If it's a boy, we name it Sam? 

08:54.034 --> 08:56.001
            Oh, I don't know.   

08:56.069 --> 08:57.536
                     You know, I
                  always thought

08:57.604 --> 08:59.171
          that naming your child
         after yourself was like

08:59.239 --> 09:02.007
     saying you want him to grow
         up to be just like you,

09:02.075 --> 09:03.676
              to like the things
                    you like,   

09:03.743 --> 09:05.544
                  to act the way
                         you do.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.513
        Okay, Sam it is.        

09:10.016 --> 09:11.950
             Yeah.              

09:12.018 --> 09:13.952
              Sam.              

09:15.355 --> 09:17.122
You know something,             
Dad?                            

09:17.190 --> 09:19.291
I really like my name.          

09:19.359 --> 09:21.527
                    Thanks, Sam.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.195
  Beautiful evening, isn't it?  

09:23.263 --> 09:24.963
    Oh, sure is, Dad.           

09:25.031 --> 09:27.132
  Say, how's that paper route   
            coming?             

09:27.200 --> 09:28.634
Just fine, Dad.                 

09:28.702 --> 09:30.302
Before long,                    
I'll have enough saved up       

09:30.370 --> 09:31.570
to buy that                     
baseball glove.                 

09:31.638 --> 09:32.871
              Ah!               

09:32.939 --> 09:34.006
 Tell me again what it was like 

09:34.074 --> 09:35.507
         when you were          
in the major leagues, Dad.      

09:35.575 --> 09:38.577
Oh, come on, you must be getting
     tired of hearing that.     

09:38.645 --> 09:40.012
How could I ever                
get tired                       

09:40.080 --> 09:42.014
of hearing                      
about you, Dad?                 

09:42.082 --> 09:44.750
        (knock at door)         

09:46.553 --> 09:48.487
          I'm coming.           

09:48.555 --> 09:49.655
             Whoa.              

09:49.723 --> 09:51.557
         Hope it's not          
     the honor bar police.      

09:53.126 --> 09:54.259
                    Oh!         

09:54.327 --> 09:55.728
          I'm sorry. Wrong room.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.529
          I went out to get some
             stuff for the kids,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.098
         and I guess I got lost.
        I'm sorry about that.   

09:59.165 --> 10:01.000
Oh, yeah, excuse me,            
if you don't mind me asking,    

10:01.067 --> 10:02.868
uh, how many kids               
you got?                        

10:02.936 --> 10:04.570
                     Three boys.
      Wow.                      

10:04.637 --> 10:05.738
Oh, that's great.               
                        Yeah.   

10:05.805 --> 10:06.739
How long have you               
been married?                   

10:06.806 --> 10:08.073
                    20 years.   

10:08.141 --> 10:09.174
    Wow.                        

10:09.242 --> 10:10.876
Hey, listen, uh,                

10:10.944 --> 10:12.878
you don't have any advice       
for a guy                       

10:12.946 --> 10:14.913
who's about to start            
his family, do you?             

10:14.981 --> 10:17.516
                 Well, you know,
                        it's,   

10:17.584 --> 10:19.518
         like it's no big secret
                what you need   

10:19.586 --> 10:20.786
                to start a happy
                         family.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.354
                      Love!     

10:22.422 --> 10:24.356
              You know, if a man
                and woman really

10:24.424 --> 10:27.026
      love each other, they pass
        that love onto the kids,

10:27.093 --> 10:29.294
             and they'll grow up
             strong and healthy.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.530
Yeah, well, I mean,             
I know love's okay              

10:31.598 --> 10:33.866
and everything,                 
but, uh, you know,              

10:33.933 --> 10:36.068
what about, uh,                 
those other important things    

10:36.136 --> 10:38.237
like friendship                 
and a sense of humor?           

10:38.304 --> 10:40.105
            A sense of humor?   

10:40.173 --> 10:41.473
    Yeah.                       

10:41.541 --> 10:42.908
            What's that gonna   
                        get you?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.310
                 I mean, look at
            Martin and Lewis.   

10:45.378 --> 10:46.645
                They had a sense
                    of humor.   

10:46.713 --> 10:47.780
            But were they happy?

10:47.847 --> 10:50.049
No, they weren't.               

10:50.116 --> 10:52.785
                  No, because it
                     takes love.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.319
You've got a lot                
of that, huh?                   

10:54.387 --> 10:56.221
                 Me? No, I can't
                stand my missus.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.557
        It's been 20 years of   
             living hell for me.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.461
              BOY:              
      Hey look, it's Dad.       

11:02.529 --> 11:03.829
    What's the matter?          

11:03.897 --> 11:05.898
  Can't you even find your way  
    back to the room,           

11:05.965 --> 11:07.166
    you stupid idiot.           

11:07.233 --> 11:09.201
             Those are the kids.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.271
             BOY 2:             
         Come on, Dad,          
    move your fat ass,          

11:12.339 --> 11:15.007
      and give me 50 bucks      
        for the arcade.         

11:15.075 --> 11:18.143
             On my good days, I,
             uh, pray for death.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.311
                      (chuckles)

11:19.379 --> 11:20.479
                    Good luck to
                    you, son.   

11:20.547 --> 11:22.247
        You're gonna need it.   

11:28.588 --> 11:30.189
              Eh.               

11:30.256 --> 11:31.523
    I bet that wouldn't have    
            happened            

11:31.591 --> 11:33.525
    if he'd named one           
        of his kids Sam.        

11:35.261 --> 11:37.196
        Yeah, Sam.              

11:38.531 --> 11:40.466
             So how's that paper
                route coming?   

11:40.533 --> 11:42.468
Oh, I've been                   
saving up.                      

11:42.535 --> 11:44.737
Why don't we pull over          
here to this market,            

11:44.804 --> 11:46.739
and I'll run in                 
and buy us a soda.              

11:46.806 --> 11:47.906
My treat.                       

11:47.974 --> 11:50.009
                Great idea, son.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.210
      I'll be right back.       

11:51.277 --> 11:54.179
                      Okeydokey.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.347
          (door shuts)          

11:55.415 --> 11:59.418
            (laughs)            
 He's got that Malone swagger.  

11:59.486 --> 12:03.322
     (indistinct shouting)      

12:03.390 --> 12:04.323
Floor it, Dad!                  

12:04.391 --> 12:05.324
             Why, what happened?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.625
      I robbed the store!       

12:06.693 --> 12:07.893
        (alarm ringing)         
            But why?            

12:07.961 --> 12:09.128
     I had to do something      
        to make up              

12:09.195 --> 12:10.496
      for the lack of love      
      between you and Mom.      

12:10.563 --> 12:13.699
Now move your fat ass,          
you stupid idiot!               
        (siren wailing)         

12:13.767 --> 12:15.668
         Why'd you two          
    even have a kid anyway?     

12:15.735 --> 12:17.870
    Well, we sort of thought    
          it'd be fun.          

12:17.937 --> 12:19.071
              Fun?              

12:19.139 --> 12:20.005
    I'll show you fun.          

12:21.041 --> 12:22.908
(gunshots)                      
                     Oh, no, no!

12:22.976 --> 12:24.243
         (tires screeching)     
I got one!                      

12:24.310 --> 12:25.978
Boy, did you see                
that guy's head explode?        

12:26.046 --> 12:28.414
Whoa, these hollow point bullets
        are great!              

12:29.582 --> 12:30.783
Hey, everybody!                 

12:30.850 --> 12:32.785
I'm little Sammy Malone!        

12:32.852 --> 12:35.087
And my dad                      
was a Major League pitcher!     

12:35.155 --> 12:38.157
And he didn't love              
my mother!                      

12:38.224 --> 12:41.794
(laughing maniacally)           

12:41.861 --> 12:43.929
              Oh!               

12:47.334 --> 12:50.369
            (device whirring)   

12:55.108 --> 12:57.409
Okay, Sam, I give in.           

12:57.477 --> 13:00.713
If it's a boy,                  
we can name him Sam.            

13:02.682 --> 13:04.283
              Sam?              

13:09.189 --> 13:12.057
        Sam? Sam?               

13:12.125 --> 13:13.659
            Oh, oh!             

13:13.727 --> 13:15.961
         (tapping door)         
              Oh!               

13:23.003 --> 13:23.969
         (door opening)         

13:24.070 --> 13:25.838
Here we go, darling.            

13:29.242 --> 13:30.609
                      I'm sorry.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.044
                 I hope I didn't
                ruin the moment.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.748
            Just, I was standing
          out in the hall naked.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.815
                The door slammed
              shut, and I didn't

13:36.883 --> 13:38.050
                  have any place
                     else to go.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.752
        Anyway, if you... if you
      could just loan me a robe,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.353
            I... I can wait back
                out in the hall.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.422
No, no, there's a robe you      
    can use in the bathroom.    

13:43.523 --> 13:45.157
Larry will go look for...       

13:45.225 --> 13:46.325
what's his name--               
Sam?                            
                      Sam.      

13:46.393 --> 13:47.659
                Sam-- oh, you   
                 can't miss him.

13:47.727 --> 13:51.330
            He's a big galoot   
             with a lantern jaw.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.666
        Have you ever been naked
             in a hotel hallway?

13:53.733 --> 13:56.068
        The sailors just come   
            out of the woodwork.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.340
Don't worry, miss, I'll         
find him and come right back.   

14:01.408 --> 14:03.308
                        REBECCA:
            See, I was in the   
         bathroom taking a bath,

14:03.376 --> 14:04.777
                     and I-I was
                 talking to Sam,

14:04.844 --> 14:06.378
            but he wasn't really
        even listening to me.   

14:06.446 --> 14:07.780
                     I mean, I-I
                guess he decided

14:07.847 --> 14:10.149
     to go down to the store and
      get some gum or something.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.017
            I don't know, and it
        was... it was like he...

14:12.085 --> 14:15.721
             he didn't even know
            that I was... alive.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.128
         Boy, you sure          
        look beautiful.         

14:23.196 --> 14:24.329
            (gasps)             

14:24.397 --> 14:27.399
Oh! Look at                     
all these flowers.              

14:27.467 --> 14:30.669
Oh, my... boy, you must         
have a huge family.             

14:30.737 --> 14:33.038
                No, those are   
                all from my guy.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.540
                 Isn't he sweet?

14:34.607 --> 14:36.508
    Wow.                        

14:36.576 --> 14:37.710
Well, mine's down               
right now,                      

14:37.777 --> 14:39.144
getting me some, uh,            

14:39.212 --> 14:42.414
gum... I think.                 

14:42.482 --> 14:44.416
How long have you and Sam       
         been married?          

14:44.484 --> 14:46.385
        Oh, actually, we        
      weren't even plan...      

14:46.453 --> 14:48.187
          Six months.           

14:48.254 --> 14:50.089
         (phone rings)          
                      Excuse me.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.256
                          Hello?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.758
                  Oh, hi, honey.

14:52.826 --> 14:53.892
                It's my husband.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.028
He's already down in the lobby? 

14:56.096 --> 14:57.796
      No, he's calling me       
    from the elevator phone     

14:57.864 --> 14:59.231
  just to tell me he loves me.  

15:00.834 --> 15:02.134
             It's supposed to be
        just for emergencies.   

15:02.202 --> 15:05.204
        Oh, you are so sweet.   

15:05.271 --> 15:09.475
Oh, you're the                  
perfect couple, aren't you?     

15:09.542 --> 15:11.910
         Oh, I bet you          
    had a beautiful wedding.    

15:11.978 --> 15:13.145
Oh, well,                       
all weddings are nice.          

15:13.213 --> 15:14.279
Wasn't yours?                   

15:14.347 --> 15:15.881
        Oh, yeah.               

15:15.949 --> 15:18.150
    We had, you know,           
        lots of flowe...        

15:18.218 --> 15:20.085
      and we had... a lot       
      of people came in...      

15:20.153 --> 15:21.920
    (voice breaking):           
        a lot of people         
    from out of town.           

15:24.958 --> 15:26.158
                If you'll excuse
                    me a minute,

15:26.226 --> 15:28.127
             I'm just gonna wait
            outside in the hall.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.031
                  Oh, hi.       

15:32.098 --> 15:33.198
                Um, there's a   
                 bellboy waiting

15:33.266 --> 15:34.500
            outside your room   
                 with a passkey.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.567
             Okay.              

15:35.669 --> 15:37.436
                Sorry I couldn't
              find your husband.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.938
                But look what   
                     I did find!

15:40.006 --> 15:42.641
          Oh, a bunny!          

15:47.947 --> 15:51.583
You have the sweetest lips in   
    the whole wide world, honey!

15:57.457 --> 16:00.526
             Mmm, you've got the
            sweetest lips in the
        whole wide world, honey.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.361
         (door opening)         

16:02.429 --> 16:04.630
Knock-knock! The little         
woman is home.                  

16:04.698 --> 16:05.864
            Hey!                

16:05.932 --> 16:07.800
What are you                    
barging in here for?            

16:07.867 --> 16:10.269
    You forgot to hang          
     the sock on the door.      

16:10.337 --> 16:12.571
    That's because I didn't     
      want to take it off.      

16:12.639 --> 16:14.473
          It was cold.          
They turned the heat off.       

16:14.541 --> 16:15.874
Oh, yeah, they turned           
the heat off                    

16:15.942 --> 16:17.576
'cause you forgot               
to pay the bill, pal!           

16:17.677 --> 16:20.145
      What was I supposed       
     to pay it with-- love?     

16:20.213 --> 16:21.780
Oh shut up.                     
                No, you shut!   

16:21.848 --> 16:22.948
            You shut!           
    Shut...                     

16:23.016 --> 16:24.983
                     Shut... up!
  Shut...!                      

16:28.621 --> 16:29.955
         Come on, Sam,          
      get her out of here.      

16:30.023 --> 16:31.090
         I'm ovulating.         

16:31.191 --> 16:34.226
            Oh, that's great.   

16:34.294 --> 16:37.429
      You couldn't tell me      
        15 minutes ago?         

16:37.497 --> 16:39.231
    Come on, scooch, honey.     

16:39.299 --> 16:42.534
I've got my chores to do.       

16:42.602 --> 16:45.237
          Yeah, go on, go on, go
            on, go on, go on.   

16:45.338 --> 16:47.272
  Oh, Sam, come on, hurry up,   
    let's make a baby!          

16:47.340 --> 16:49.041
     Let's go in the other      
        room and do it!         

16:49.109 --> 16:51.176
This is the other room.         

16:52.746 --> 16:55.347
     Oh God! Why are we so      
      poor and miserable?       

16:55.415 --> 16:57.082
  Well, honey, we may be poor   
         and miserable,         

16:57.150 --> 16:59.218
    but at least we can live    
            on love!            

16:59.285 --> 17:01.620
          You shut up!          

17:01.721 --> 17:02.721
        Oh, you shut up!        
No, you shut up!                

17:02.856 --> 17:03.989
                     Shut me up!

17:04.057 --> 17:05.691
    Shut up!                    
                     Shut up!   

17:07.594 --> 17:09.060
Don't you use                   
that word "love."               

17:09.128 --> 17:10.896
     Love has nothing to do     
    with this relationship!     

17:10.964 --> 17:12.664
I will use any word I want      
         in this house!         

17:12.732 --> 17:13.766
             Love!              

17:13.833 --> 17:14.800
                     Love, love,
                     love, love,

17:14.867 --> 17:15.901
    love, love, love!           

17:15.969 --> 17:17.935
 You foul-mouthed barren tramp! 

17:18.003 --> 17:19.238
      Half man! Half man!       

17:19.406 --> 17:21.674
         (Sam grunting)         

17:25.011 --> 17:27.279
    Enough foreplay for you?    

17:27.347 --> 17:29.815
Yeah. Turn off the light.       

17:29.916 --> 17:32.951
        I've got a poker game on
     that table in five minutes.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.386
     You'd better make it quick.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.522
        Oh, yeah, that's        
    gonna be tough with you.    

17:36.589 --> 17:38.590
        Hey, shut up!           
                You shut up!    

17:38.658 --> 17:39.758
You shut up!                    

17:39.826 --> 17:40.826
Shut!                           
                Shut!           

17:40.894 --> 17:42.461
             BOTH:              
            Shut up!            

17:47.233 --> 17:48.934
Could you leave now?            

17:49.002 --> 17:50.436
        Oh, sure.               

17:58.945 --> 18:00.779
                    Hey.        

18:00.847 --> 18:03.382
      Why aren't you home       
watching your scabby kid?       

18:05.819 --> 18:08.554
My mother's come into town      
to help take care of him.       

18:08.621 --> 18:11.056
  So I thought I'd steal a few  
     moments and come here      

18:11.124 --> 18:12.324
and relax with my husband.      

18:12.392 --> 18:13.359
         He's not here.         

18:13.426 --> 18:15.294
          Better yet.           

18:16.796 --> 18:18.964
Where is my husband,            
anyway?                         

18:19.032 --> 18:20.532
    Oh, uh, some of the guys    

18:20.600 --> 18:22.835
     went to do something,      
    and he went along.          

18:22.902 --> 18:27.172
I suppose if they all           
went to jump off a cliff        
he'd do that, too.              

18:27.240 --> 18:29.708
  I, didn't think of that, but  
 it probably would have worked. 

18:31.144 --> 18:32.945
          (chanting):           
          Polar Bear!           

18:33.013 --> 18:34.580
    Polar Bear! Polar Bear!     

18:35.882 --> 18:37.349
     Hey, so you guys went      
     for your little swim?      

18:37.417 --> 18:39.018
            Yeah, well, we drove
        down there, you know,   

18:39.085 --> 18:40.853
              we jumped into our
            bathing suits, uh...

18:40.920 --> 18:42.154
        raced each other        
        along the beach         

18:42.222 --> 18:43.355
our feet hit the water...       

18:43.423 --> 18:44.990
 And you chickened out, right?  

18:45.058 --> 18:46.558
        Yeah, well, we prefer   
                  to think of it

18:46.626 --> 18:48.660
                as coming to our
             senses just in time
            to save our goodies.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.465
So none of you guys had the guts
  to go through with it, huh?   

18:53.533 --> 18:55.300
    Well, uh, one of us did.    

18:59.606 --> 19:01.540
                 Just a few more
            steps, Dr. Crane.   

19:03.176 --> 19:04.910
  Darling, are you all right?   

19:04.978 --> 19:06.145
        (whimpers)              

19:06.212 --> 19:08.047
What did he say?                

19:08.114 --> 19:09.948
         Sounded like "oil can."

19:12.152 --> 19:14.853
Here, this should               
help warm you up.               

19:17.624 --> 19:20.125
It must have been               
a terrifying experience.        

19:20.193 --> 19:21.326
              Oh!               

19:21.394 --> 19:24.530
It was positively surreal.      

19:24.597 --> 19:27.933
 First, the cold water hitting  
  me like an electric shock...  

19:28.001 --> 19:30.336
     dragging me down like      
    a palpable force.           

19:30.403 --> 19:33.872
  And then when I was crawling  
      back onto the beach,      

19:33.940 --> 19:36.342
it kept at me, as though,       
    for all the world,          

19:36.409 --> 19:40.913
someone was actually pushing me 
  back into the frozen water.   

19:40.980 --> 19:43.515
Told you                        
it wasn't funny.                

19:58.965 --> 20:01.600
Where have you been, Sam?       

20:01.668 --> 20:03.369
                    Just, uh,   
                went for a walk,

20:03.436 --> 20:05.671
        you know, to get some   
    fresh air and everything.   

20:05.739 --> 20:08.741
          So... ready           
    to make the baby?           

20:08.808 --> 20:11.377
     Sure I am, if you are.     

20:11.444 --> 20:12.845
                    Oh, you are?

20:12.912 --> 20:14.980
                 Uh, well, yeah.
                All right, good.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.682
                 Let's... let's,
                 get to it here.

20:16.750 --> 20:17.816
    Okay.                       

20:21.821 --> 20:26.558
    Okay, let's, let's, uh,     
     let's make that baby.      

20:26.626 --> 20:29.862
There's something wrong         
isn't there, Sam?               

20:32.032 --> 20:34.700
  Uh, yeah, there's something   
    I want to say and I-I...    

20:34.768 --> 20:36.969
    I've been walking around    
      trying to figure out      

20:37.037 --> 20:39.238
  how to say it and I, I guess  
      the only thing to do      

20:39.305 --> 20:40.773
        is just, say it.        

20:40.840 --> 20:42.975
     Sam, I don't love you.     
 I'm not gonna have your baby.  

20:43.043 --> 20:44.309
          It would be           
     a big, stupid mistake.     

20:44.377 --> 20:45.477
             What?              

20:45.545 --> 20:48.280
    What were you gonna say?    

20:48.348 --> 20:52.351
     Well, the same thing,      
     but a much nicer way.      

20:53.787 --> 20:55.087
You were?                       

20:55.155 --> 20:56.655
                        Yeah.   

20:56.723 --> 20:59.258
         I mean, you know, if we
          don't love each other,

20:59.325 --> 21:00.659
         how can we raise a kid?

21:00.727 --> 21:01.794
That's right!                   

21:01.861 --> 21:03.796
     Because it wouldn't be     
        fair to the kid.        

21:03.863 --> 21:05.831
                  I agree.      
I mean, I mean, all             
we've talked about              

21:05.899 --> 21:07.833
is how much we want             
a baby. We, we, we.             

21:07.901 --> 21:09.168
We never even                   
thought about...                

21:09.235 --> 21:11.337
about how it would be           
for a baby to have us.          
                  I agree.      

21:11.404 --> 21:13.772
I mean, I think we got          
to call the whole thing off.    
                Oh, I agree!    

21:13.840 --> 21:15.074
        I can't believe this!   

21:15.141 --> 21:16.642
         This is the first thing
              we've agreed about

21:16.710 --> 21:18.143
            since the whole baby
                  thing came up.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.878
        I agree!                

21:19.946 --> 21:21.947
Oh, Sam I love you!             
            Oh, I love you, too!

21:22.015 --> 21:23.182
I mean, I don't                 
"love you," love you.           

21:23.249 --> 21:25.150
         No, I don't "love you,"
            love you, either.   

21:25.218 --> 21:27.953
And Sam, we can still have kids,
just not with each other.       

21:28.021 --> 21:29.288
                Yeah.           

21:36.162 --> 21:37.529
         Mm.                    
            Mm-mm. I'm sorry.   

21:37.597 --> 21:39.164
                  Old habit.    

21:39.232 --> 21:41.667
That's right,                   
we're just friends.             

21:41.735 --> 21:44.203
          Yeah. Actually friends
        don't open their mouths.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.638
    Oh. Old habit.              

21:50.076 --> 21:51.310
            (sighs)             

21:54.147 --> 21:56.548
See you at work                 
tomorrow.                       

21:56.616 --> 21:57.883
             Yeah.              

21:57.951 --> 21:59.752
            Bye-bye.            

22:16.870 --> 22:18.971
     Sam, what's happening?     

22:19.039 --> 22:20.572
See you in a couple years, Dad. 

22:20.640 --> 22:21.807
              Sam?              

22:21.875 --> 22:24.643
Where are you going?            

22:24.711 --> 22:27.546
              Sam?              

22:43.163 --> 22:44.797
                 You rotten kid!

22:44.864 --> 22:46.498
            Now listen, bring   
                 back my wallet!

22:46.566 --> 22:48.233
KID:                            
You're beginning                
to waddle!
