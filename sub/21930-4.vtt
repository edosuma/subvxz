WEBVTT

00:02.742 --> 00:04.775
It feels like it
wasn't that long ago

00:04.777 --> 00:07.044
we were here doing
this for Halley.

00:07.046 --> 00:09.580
'Cause it wasn't.

00:09.582 --> 00:11.482
Which reminds me,
before we leave,

00:11.484 --> 00:13.617
let's get you a vasectomy.

00:13.619 --> 00:18.389
Oh, that's sweet, but
today is all about you.

00:20.092 --> 00:23.027
So, you two ready to find
out the sex of this baby?

00:23.029 --> 00:24.295
Yeah.
Absolutely.

00:24.297 --> 00:25.763
Is Halley hoping

00:25.765 --> 00:27.565
for a little brother
or a little sister?

00:27.567 --> 00:28.899
Well, she's nine months old,

00:28.901 --> 00:32.970
so unless it jingles or is
in my bra, she doesn't care.

00:32.972 --> 00:36.340
And how about you two?

00:36.342 --> 00:39.577
You know, for the first one,
we really wanted a girl,

00:39.579 --> 00:42.279
but this time around, we
don't have a preference.

00:42.281 --> 00:45.349
Yeah. Boy, girl,
as long as it's healthy.

00:45.351 --> 00:47.485
Well, it's a boy.

00:47.487 --> 00:49.253
(heartbeat pulsing)

00:49.255 --> 00:52.022
Oh.
Oh.

00:52.024 --> 00:55.593
Come on, you can't
really be disappointed.

00:55.595 --> 00:57.595
Hey, I barely know
how to be a man myself.

00:57.597 --> 00:59.597
Now I have
to teach someone?

00:59.599 --> 01:03.634
As the saying goes,
“Those who can't do, teach”"

01:04.670 --> 01:06.704
Don't you want a little
version of Howard?

01:06.706 --> 01:10.040
I already have a little
version of Howard.

01:10.977 --> 01:12.610
Now I'm having a son?

01:12.612 --> 01:15.412
I'll have to teach him
how to play sports,

01:15.414 --> 01:17.882
and-and watch sports

01:17.884 --> 01:20.851
and-and-and-and-and-and...

01:20.853 --> 01:24.021
He just ran out of man things.
He's in trouble.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.992
It's okay. We're
all here to help.

01:27.994 --> 01:31.562
Yes. And this baby will have
plenty of manly role models.

01:31.564 --> 01:33.898
Now, I'm certain that whatever
Bernadette can't teach him,

01:33.900 --> 01:35.165
Penny can.

01:36.502 --> 01:38.602
Uh, she can pee into a bottle.

01:38.604 --> 01:39.670
Mm-hmm.

01:39.672 --> 01:41.906
Anything with a neck
wider than a nickel.

01:43.843 --> 01:47.278
Howie, there's a lot of amazing
things you can teach a son.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.548
Yeah. You do always know how
to pick just the right antacid.

01:50.550 --> 01:53.551
I don't know if
I can teach that.

01:53.553 --> 01:56.020
It's just something
I was born with.

01:56.022 --> 01:58.055
Come on. You can build things.

01:58.057 --> 01:59.590
You were an astronaut.

01:59.592 --> 02:01.058
That's true.

02:01.060 --> 02:03.394
You know, as a kid,
I used to make model rockets.

02:03.396 --> 02:05.229
That'd be pretty cool
to do with a son.

02:05.231 --> 02:07.865
Model rockets. Finally,
something interesting.

02:07.867 --> 02:11.135
What is your preferred
mode of recovery?

02:11.137 --> 02:13.370
Sheldon, we're helping
our friends.

02:13.372 --> 02:16.607
And we got to model
rockets, yeah?

02:16.609 --> 02:19.810
It was a tedious road,
but well worth the effort.

02:19.812 --> 02:22.479
- So, have you thought of any names?
- Amy.

02:22.481 --> 02:23.647
We finally got
to model rockets.

02:23.649 --> 02:25.082

02:55.669 --> 02:57.002
Hey, where are you going?

02:57.004 --> 02:58.770
Back to the dry cleaner.
Look at this.

02:58.772 --> 03:01.240
They didn't get the stain
out of my Starfleet uniform.

03:01.242 --> 03:04.276
Well, if you didn't make me wear
the green body paint in bed,

03:04.278 --> 03:07.279
you wouldn't have to get it
dry-cleaned so much.

03:07.281 --> 03:09.181
Nah, it's worth it.

03:10.551 --> 03:11.783
(Skype ringtone playing)

03:11.785 --> 03:13.151
Hey, wait, it's your mom.

03:13.153 --> 03:16.088
Oh, too bad.
She just missed me!

03:19.527 --> 03:20.859
Hey, Beverly.

03:20.861 --> 03:22.361
Oh, hello, Penny.

03:22.363 --> 03:23.562
Uh, Leonard just left.

03:23.564 --> 03:25.864
He's gonna be so upset
he missed your call.

03:25.866 --> 03:27.599
Why?

03:27.601 --> 03:29.468
Because he...

03:29.470 --> 03:30.802
Yeah, I don't know.

03:30.804 --> 03:32.838
How are you?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.274
Did you mean personally
or professionally?

03:35.276 --> 03:36.775
Um, personally?

03:36.777 --> 03:38.844
Like, what'd you do last night?

03:38.846 --> 03:41.113
I had Cuban food
at the home of a man

03:41.115 --> 03:45.117
with whom I shared
unsatisfying intercourse.

03:46.954 --> 03:49.521
Wow. Okay.

03:51.258 --> 03:53.659
And to anticipate
your next questions,

03:53.661 --> 03:56.929
roasted pork
and sideways missionary.

03:59.466 --> 04:02.935
Sure. Sure.
'Cause you were full.

04:05.039 --> 04:07.806
I haven't looked
at all this stuff in years.

04:07.808 --> 04:09.141
Had it.

04:09.143 --> 04:10.676
Had it.

04:10.678 --> 04:13.579
Burnt down my garage with it.

04:13.581 --> 04:15.647
I had three model rockets
as a kid,

04:15.649 --> 04:18.649
and that was the largest
space program in India.

04:18.652 --> 04:22.254
You have a replica Saturn V?

04:22.256 --> 04:25.257
Yeah. My dad bought it
before he, you know,

04:25.259 --> 04:27.192
abandoned our family.

04:27.194 --> 04:29.294
Lucky duck.

04:29.296 --> 04:34.099
Could never bring myself to
open it without him. (chuckles)

04:34.101 --> 04:35.701
It's silly.

04:35.703 --> 04:36.835
No, it's not silly.

04:36.837 --> 04:38.904
I always wanted my dad
to build rockets with me,

04:38.906 --> 04:41.239
but he wasn't interested.

04:41.241 --> 04:42.708
Ah, yes, disappointing
fathers.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.109
Tell me about it.

04:44.111 --> 04:47.179
I remember for my 16th birthday,
my dad bought me a Mercedes.

04:47.181 --> 04:50.382
Like, a little one,
like a starter Mercedes.

04:51.819 --> 04:52.985
He had barely handed me the keys

04:52.987 --> 04:54.720
before he had
to rush back to work.

04:54.722 --> 04:57.990
I didn't see him again till,
like, pretty late that night.

05:00.794 --> 05:02.661
Anyway...

05:04.064 --> 05:07.766
...as angry as I was
with him leaving,

05:07.768 --> 05:09.935
building this stuff
is probably what led me

05:09.937 --> 05:11.470
to become an engineer.

05:11.472 --> 05:13.705
I suppose, in his own way,

05:13.707 --> 05:15.707
my dad also encouraged me
to pursue science.

05:15.709 --> 05:17.542
I mean, he is the one
that taught me

05:17.544 --> 05:19.811
that flatulence
is combustible.

05:20.881 --> 05:24.816
And also, polyester
gym shorts don't burn.

05:24.818 --> 05:26.318
They melt.

05:28.022 --> 05:30.055
Yeah, I guess I'm an
astrophysicist because,

05:30.057 --> 05:32.524
as a kid, I said I like
to look at the stars,

05:32.526 --> 05:35.727
so my dad sent me to Hawaii
to visit the Keck telescope.

05:38.532 --> 05:40.699
Screw you. My pain is real.

05:44.405 --> 05:47.005
You know what?
Forget the past.

05:47.007 --> 05:50.275
What do you say you and
me build this rocket?

05:50.277 --> 05:52.010
That sounds like
it could be

05:52.012 --> 05:53.845
a real bonding
experience for us.

05:53.847 --> 05:54.880
Right?

05:54.882 --> 05:55.847
Oh, I see.

05:55.849 --> 05:58.050
Oh, you think
that's a positive.

06:02.189 --> 06:04.956
So, you don't want to hang out
with Sheldon and Howard?

06:04.958 --> 06:07.492
No, they were bonding
over their sad childhoods,

06:07.494 --> 06:11.363
and my stupid parents
were always there for me.

06:12.599 --> 06:13.932
What's all this?

06:13.934 --> 06:16.134
I'm just boxing up all
the clothes Halley's outgrown.

06:16.136 --> 06:18.103
Guess we won't
need them anymore.

06:18.105 --> 06:19.438
Oh, well, slow down.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.440
I'm sure there's some
you could reuse for a boy.

06:21.442 --> 06:24.609
“Daddy's little girl”?

06:24.611 --> 06:27.279
Okay, well, what if we, uh,
change it to say,

06:27.281 --> 06:29.748
“Daddy's little girl magnet”?

06:29.750 --> 06:31.550
Boom! Boy shirt.

06:33.420 --> 06:34.586
What about this?

06:34.588 --> 06:35.954
Uh, okay.

06:35.956 --> 06:38.457
Uh, pull off the skirt, slap
a lightning bolt on the front,

06:38.459 --> 06:40.192
and you got baby Flash.

06:40.194 --> 06:41.393
Ooh.

06:41.395 --> 06:42.594
Stick a long sleeve under it.

06:42.596 --> 06:44.963
Boom! Baby Sheldon.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.166
Wow, you're really good at this.

06:48.168 --> 06:49.301
Oh, please.

06:49.303 --> 06:50.535
This isn't my first time

06:50.537 --> 06:53.205
turning girl clothes
into boy clothes.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.115
Why? You got your sister's
hand-me-downs?

06:57.117 --> 07:00.452
Yeah, that.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.725
Oh. I should've
brought peanuts.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.760
You can't eat peanuts.
You're allergic.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.963
If you die, who's going
to drive me home?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.531
I'm not gonna eat them.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.066
It's a thing
they do at JPL.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.135
When the Ranger mission finally
had a successful launch,

07:17.137 --> 07:18.436
there were peanuts
in the room.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.206
Ever since then,
they have them at every launch.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.808
That sounds like
a silly superstition.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.277
It's more of a tradition.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.713
Oh! I do love a tradition.

07:28.715 --> 07:32.383
Could you pull over
at the next peanut store?

07:32.385 --> 07:35.353
I don't think
that's a real thing.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.721
Oh, don't be pedantic.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.356
Any nut store will do.

07:38.358 --> 07:42.794
I-I don't think we can
get peanuts out here.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.131
Ah, well, then
this whole day's ruined.

07:46.133 --> 07:50.135
Now that I think about it, maybe
it is more of a superstition.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.870
Whew! That was close.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.643
(ringtone playing)

08:00.447 --> 08:03.414
Oh, uh, hey, Beverly, you called
my phone, not Leonard's.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.484
Actually, I was hoping
to speak with you.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.119
Is this a good time?

08:08.121 --> 08:09.954
Uh, that depends.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.656
What time is it where you are?

08:11.658 --> 08:12.824
Uh, just after 5:00.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.126
(clears throat)
Yeah, that counts.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.662
What's up?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.999
Well, I enjoyed our conversation
the other day,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.067
and I was hoping to continue it.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.269
Really?

08:24.271 --> 08:26.571
Uh, yes. You may
find this surprising,

08:26.573 --> 08:29.841
but I don't have a lot of
what you would call girlfriends.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.711
(exaggerated):
What?

08:33.712 --> 08:37.115
Of course, there are
my female colleagues,

08:37.116 --> 08:39.049
but, uh, they're all Freudians,

08:39.052 --> 08:42.554
so the only boy that I can
dish about is my father.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.856
(laughs)

08:48.762 --> 08:50.024
Uh, well, you know,
I'm here for you.

08:50.025 --> 08:51.424
What do you want to talk about?

08:51.426 --> 08:54.627
Well, last time,
we focused on my life.

08:54.629 --> 08:56.496
If we're going to be
real girlfriends,

08:56.498 --> 08:58.197
we should talk about you
as well.

08:58.199 --> 08:59.632
Well, you know,
if we're gonna be

08:59.634 --> 09:01.668
real girlfriends,
we should get a third girl

09:01.670 --> 09:04.470
we can trash behind her back.

09:04.472 --> 09:07.307
Oh, so we'd be catty.

09:07.309 --> 09:10.043
Oh, I like it.

09:10.045 --> 09:12.111
What about Sheldon's fiancée?

09:12.113 --> 09:15.081
She seems a bit dour.

09:15.083 --> 09:17.784
Ooh, “dour.”

09:17.786 --> 09:19.485
Meow.

09:23.625 --> 09:24.924
All right.

09:24.926 --> 09:26.292
Here we go.

09:26.294 --> 09:28.561
L-minus ten, nine...

09:28.563 --> 09:30.797
Wait, what are you doing?
It's “T-minus”"

09:30.799 --> 09:33.366
I was an astronaut.
We used L-minus.

09:33.368 --> 09:35.368
But this is a Saturn V,

09:35.370 --> 09:36.903
and when they launched those,
they said “T-minus”"

09:36.905 --> 09:40.173
It's my rocket!
We're doing it my way.

09:40.175 --> 09:42.675
Fine.

09:44.112 --> 09:46.012
I'm not saying
I know why your dad left,

09:46.014 --> 09:48.314
but I think I'm getting an idea.

09:50.185 --> 09:51.284
L-minus

09:51.286 --> 09:53.219
ten, nine, eight,

09:53.221 --> 09:54.487
seven, six...

09:54.489 --> 09:58.191
'Cause you're
kind of bossy.

09:58.193 --> 10:01.227
...five, four, three, two,

10:01.229 --> 10:02.695
one...

10:06.701 --> 10:09.836
I remember them
going up higher.

10:18.177 --> 10:19.243
Well, that's perfect.

10:19.245 --> 10:21.211
I mean, the one thing
I thought I could

10:21.213 --> 10:23.948
do with my son,
I can't even do that right.

10:23.950 --> 10:27.418
Well, if you want to see it
again, I got it on video.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.254
Looks pretty cool
in slow motion.

10:30.256 --> 10:31.956
Thank you for
your support.

10:31.958 --> 10:34.224
You're welcome.
I was being sarcastic.

10:34.226 --> 10:35.859
How dare you!

10:37.930 --> 10:40.197
Sheldon, what am I
gonna do?

10:40.199 --> 10:44.268
I mean, what do I know
about raising a boy?

10:44.270 --> 10:48.205
What do you know
about raising a girl?

10:49.542 --> 10:52.309
Oh, my God, you're right.

10:52.311 --> 10:55.512
Well, I don't know if
that was sarcasm or not.

10:55.514 --> 10:58.949
So, either you're welcome,
or hey!

11:03.589 --> 11:05.723
(phone chimes)

11:07.493 --> 11:09.293
Leonard, did you really
just text me from the couch

11:09.295 --> 11:11.895
to put extra mustard
on your sandwich?

11:11.897 --> 11:15.032
I was worried you might not
check your e-mail.

11:17.536 --> 11:18.535
(phone chimes)

11:18.537 --> 11:20.671
I swear to God,
I will throw this out.

11:20.673 --> 11:22.406
That one was not me.

11:22.408 --> 11:24.241
Oh, wait, it was just your mom.

11:24.243 --> 11:25.876
My mother's texting you?

11:25.878 --> 11:27.978
Yeah. We've been talking
a lot lately.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.047
Why?

11:30.049 --> 11:33.951
She sick of talking to
the magic mirror on the wall?

11:33.953 --> 11:36.320
No, I think she's lonely.

11:36.322 --> 11:37.955
She's been reaching out.

11:37.957 --> 11:41.392
Okay, just be careful.

11:41.394 --> 11:42.993
You think you're
getting close to her,

11:42.995 --> 11:45.429
and the next thing you know,
you're featured in a book

11:45.431 --> 11:50.067
called <i>He's Doing It On Purpose:</i>
<i>Raising a Teenage Bed-Wetter.</i>

11:50.069 --> 11:52.002
No, it's not like that.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.204
You know, she's been
opening up about her life,

11:54.206 --> 11:56.807
and she's actually been
really supportive about mine.

11:56.809 --> 11:58.208
Really?
Yeah.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.443
I've been telling her
about my job,

11:59.445 --> 12:01.512
and she said
she was proud of me.

12:01.514 --> 12:04.882
Well, that's great.

12:05.951 --> 12:08.952
Never told me
she was proud of me.

12:10.489 --> 12:14.124
Even when I stayed dry
for a whole month.

12:14.126 --> 12:17.261
Do you not want me
to be friends with your mom?

12:17.263 --> 12:18.896
Well, let's be clear.

12:18.898 --> 12:21.965
I-I married you to hurt her.

12:24.603 --> 12:26.904
You're kind of ruining it.

12:29.275 --> 12:32.676
Reason number 13
to feel good:

12:32.678 --> 12:34.912
as a launch, it was bad,

12:34.914 --> 12:37.815
but as an explosion,
it was glorious.

12:39.452 --> 12:40.884
Reason 14:

12:40.886 --> 12:43.620
you still have
all your fingers,

12:43.622 --> 12:46.723
and boys prefer
a dad with fingers.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.125
Thanks for trying,

12:48.127 --> 12:50.427
but you're not gonna be able
to cheer me up.

12:50.429 --> 12:52.496
Well, how about
this, then?

12:52.498 --> 12:54.231
You quit your whining
before I give you

12:54.233 --> 12:56.300
something to cry
about, young man.

12:56.302 --> 12:58.435
What?

12:58.437 --> 13:02.406
Those are comforting words
my father would often say.

13:02.408 --> 13:04.241
Did it help?

13:04.243 --> 13:06.176
I turned out great.

13:06.178 --> 13:07.678
You tell me.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.280
Let's get going.

13:10.282 --> 13:13.150
Are you gonna be this
mopey all the way home?

13:13.152 --> 13:14.685
I don't know, maybe.

13:14.687 --> 13:16.353
There any chance
you'd be cheered up

13:16.355 --> 13:18.622
by an amazing
trigonometry riddle?

13:20.259 --> 13:21.925
Well, if you can't
answer that,

13:21.927 --> 13:24.027
there's no way you're
gonna get this riddle.

13:30.936 --> 13:33.770
Oh, hey, hey,
what do you think?

13:33.772 --> 13:36.140
Just because it's a boy,
I don't think you need to

13:36.142 --> 13:38.609
put a picture of
genitals on his shirt.

13:38.611 --> 13:42.379
But that's a baseball bat
with two little baseballs.

13:42.381 --> 13:45.149
Okay, and now I see it.

13:46.886 --> 13:49.286
So, you know,
I understand why

13:49.288 --> 13:51.255
Howard is nervous
about having a son,

13:51.257 --> 13:53.223
but are you really
upset about it?

13:53.225 --> 13:54.858
No, I'm fine.

13:54.860 --> 13:56.827
It's just, I grew up
with a bunch of brothers,

13:56.829 --> 13:59.496
so I thought it'd be nice
for Halley to have a sister.

13:59.498 --> 14:00.631
Is that wrong?

14:00.633 --> 14:02.566
Of course it's wrong.

14:02.568 --> 14:04.101
You don't know what this
little boy's gonna be like.

14:04.103 --> 14:06.503
Maybe he'll be rough and tumble,

14:06.505 --> 14:08.805
or maybe he'll be sweet
and sensitive,

14:08.807 --> 14:12.409
or maybe he'll be
all those things, like me.

14:14.513 --> 14:16.480
You're rough
and tumble?

14:18.083 --> 14:21.151
You bet I am, bitch.

14:22.288 --> 14:26.823
But I'm also sensitive
and regret saying that.

14:29.695 --> 14:31.128
(knock on door)

14:31.130 --> 14:33.263
Hey.
Hello.

14:33.265 --> 14:35.732
You got a sec?

14:35.734 --> 14:36.700
Sure. What's up?

14:36.702 --> 14:39.036
Penny's been talking
to my mother

14:39.038 --> 14:42.172
like they're best friends, and
it's kind of freaking me out.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.775
Okay...

14:44.777 --> 14:48.946
I'm pretty sure
they're not best friends.

14:51.317 --> 14:54.451
'Cause you can only have
one best friend.

14:56.021 --> 14:59.389
And Penny has that,
and (clicks tongue) it's me.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.493
Oh, really? Is she FaceTiming
with you right now?

15:03.495 --> 15:05.429
Because she's FaceTiming
with my mom, and believe me,

15:05.431 --> 15:08.899
that is not a face
you want to spend time with.

15:08.901 --> 15:12.569
Hmm. Well, I have been
pretty busy lately.

15:12.571 --> 15:14.638
Maybe I've been
neglecting our friendship.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.106
Penny knows I have
a complicated relationship

15:16.108 --> 15:17.874
with my mother;
it's like she doesn't even care.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.443
And with everything
going on at the lab

15:19.445 --> 15:20.711
and planning the wedding,

15:20.713 --> 15:23.547
I just, I have
so little free time.

15:23.549 --> 15:26.350
Penny doesn't know how
manipulative my mother can be.

15:26.352 --> 15:27.651
Did you know
there's such a thing as

15:27.653 --> 15:29.519
reverse, reverse,
reverse psychology?

15:29.521 --> 15:32.856
Because... there is.

15:32.858 --> 15:34.358
I mean, she must feel
so abandoned.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.226
She's used to me
being there all the time,

15:36.228 --> 15:37.628
but now I have my own life,

15:37.630 --> 15:39.696
and she's just gonna
have to accept it.

15:39.698 --> 15:42.499
And why is my mom
proud of Penny and not me?

15:42.501 --> 15:44.568
I mean, the real question is:
why is Penny so afraid of me

15:44.570 --> 15:45.669
growing as a person?

15:45.671 --> 15:46.870
I'm good at stuff, too!

15:46.872 --> 15:49.339
I deserve my own life!

15:51.510 --> 15:53.076
Okay, well, thanks.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.645
Good talk.

16:00.619 --> 16:02.452
You know,
studies have shown

16:02.454 --> 16:05.589
that people distracted
by emotional issues

16:05.591 --> 16:07.557
are poor drivers.

16:07.559 --> 16:12.362
What about people distracted
by irritating passengers?

16:13.299 --> 16:14.798
That would be hard to test,

16:14.800 --> 16:17.968
because irritating is
a subjective quality.

16:17.970 --> 16:20.837
Strongly disagree.

16:25.711 --> 16:27.010
Can I drive?

16:27.012 --> 16:28.612
No. (chuckles)

16:28.614 --> 16:29.746
You can't drive.

16:29.748 --> 16:31.815
You don't even have a license.

16:31.817 --> 16:33.016
Actually, I do.

16:33.018 --> 16:36.286
Really? Since when?

16:36.288 --> 16:37.721
Three years ago.

16:37.723 --> 16:40.324
I went on a bit
of a license kick.

16:40.326 --> 16:43.293
I'm also
a commercial fisherman.

16:44.196 --> 16:46.863
Then why don't you ever
drive yourself?

16:46.865 --> 16:48.732
Honestly, I barely
passed my test.

16:48.734 --> 16:50.634
And the one time
I drove on my own,

16:50.636 --> 16:55.205
I made a U-turn, got dizzy,
threw up and walked home.

16:56.442 --> 16:58.342
You really want to drive?

16:58.344 --> 17:00.477
It seems like
the perfect time.

17:00.479 --> 17:03.213
The roads are straight,
there's no one around,

17:03.215 --> 17:06.483
and you don't seem to care
if you live or die.

17:06.484 --> 17:10.020
Live, Sheldon.
I want to live.

17:10.021 --> 17:11.688
That makes things
a little trickier,

17:11.690 --> 17:13.323
but I'll do my best.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.361
(line ringing)

17:17.363 --> 17:18.395
BEVERLY:
Hi, Pen...

17:18.396 --> 17:21.164
Oh, hello, Leonard.

17:22.835 --> 17:24.166
Hello, Mother. How are you?

17:24.169 --> 17:26.303
Fine. And you?
I'm great.

17:26.305 --> 17:28.472
Well, it's been lovely
catching up.

17:28.473 --> 17:31.108
Wait. Hang on.
We need to talk.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.877
Oh, brother.

17:33.879 --> 17:37.614
I want to know,
why aren't you proud of me?

17:37.616 --> 17:39.816
Well, isn't the real question,

17:39.818 --> 17:41.985
“Why aren't you proud
of yourself?”

17:41.987 --> 17:47.557
No, that is <i>a</i> question--
and I ask it a lot--

17:47.559 --> 17:49.860
but let's stick
with the one I asked you.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.629
But why do you think
I'm not proud of you?

17:52.631 --> 17:55.065
Because you never say it.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.767
But two days into
chatting with Penny,

17:56.769 --> 17:59.136
and you can't stop
telling her how great she is.

17:59.138 --> 18:00.370
She is great.

18:00.372 --> 18:03.440
Honestly, of all
of my children's spouses,

18:03.442 --> 18:05.942
she's the one
that I'm most impressed by.

18:05.944 --> 18:07.944
Seriously?

18:07.946 --> 18:09.045
Yes.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.448
She's confident,
she's thoughtful,

18:11.450 --> 18:13.650
and she never complained
about you once.

18:13.652 --> 18:16.987
I know what kind of strength
that takes.

18:16.989 --> 18:20.424
So, Penny's your favorite?

18:20.426 --> 18:22.893
I suppose she is.

18:22.895 --> 18:27.297
You married well, Leonard,
and for that I am proud of you.

18:29.968 --> 18:32.536
I don't... I don't...
I don't know what to say.

18:32.538 --> 18:36.506
I'm also proud of how hard
you're trying not to cry.

18:38.343 --> 18:39.676
(choked up):
Thank you.

18:39.678 --> 18:41.478
Would you like to hang up now?

18:41.480 --> 18:43.180
Yeah, here it comes.

18:50.456 --> 18:52.622
Your hands are at
10:00 and 2:00.

18:52.624 --> 18:55.559
Good.
Steady on the gas.

18:55.561 --> 18:57.360
Okay.

18:57.362 --> 19:01.031
Now you're gonna want
to slowly switch lanes.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.032
Why?

19:02.034 --> 19:03.900
Because there are only two,

19:03.902 --> 19:06.336
and you're not
in either of them.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.642
Attaboy. Well done!

19:12.644 --> 19:13.944
Thank you.

19:13.946 --> 19:16.446
The last time I drove,
I was terrified,

19:16.448 --> 19:18.048
but this is fun.

19:18.050 --> 19:19.916
You're doing great.

19:19.918 --> 19:22.085
You're a good teacher.

19:24.623 --> 19:28.358
Your son is going to be lucky
to have you as a father.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.594
Thanks.

19:33.398 --> 19:37.267
Do you think I could try
going a little faster?

19:37.269 --> 19:38.768
Go for it, champ.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.837
Ow.

19:40.839 --> 19:42.272
Sorry.

19:42.274 --> 19:44.441
Just ease on the gas, and...

19:44.443 --> 19:45.909
(engine revving)
Oh, too much! Too much!

19:45.911 --> 19:48.578
Why was I scared of this?
This is exhilarating!

19:48.580 --> 19:49.946
No, it's not! Slow down!

19:49.948 --> 19:51.848
Don't tell me what to do!
You're not my father!

20:05.455 --> 20:07.488
Do you know how fast
you were going?

20:07.490 --> 20:09.924
112.

20:11.361 --> 20:13.294
Let me see your license.

20:14.864 --> 20:17.331
- Okay, here's the plan.
-No.

20:19.035 --> 20:20.034
Fine.

20:20.036 --> 20:22.103
There you go.

20:24.441 --> 20:27.074
You know what,
you can just keep it.
