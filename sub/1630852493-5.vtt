making me feel bad
every time I got emotional.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.130
And today I realized
that voice was my mama.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.132
Dre.
Hmm?

18:11.132 --> 18:14.885
We are gonna be the voice
in our child's head.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.264
So what are we gonna do
about it?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.266
I do not know.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.518
You know, if ‐‐ if we're gonna
fail no matter what...

18:22.518 --> 18:23.769
Mm‐hmm.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.480
...do we just lean into it?
I‐I don't know.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.190
A‐Abandon them?
No, Dre.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.775
That's still illegal.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.319
Okay, so we just
live with the fact

18:31.319 --> 18:33.863
knowing we're gonna be the voice
in their heads influencing them

18:33.863 --> 18:36.991
towards every good and bad
decision that they'll ever make.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.326
Yes, I think so.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.119
Mm!

18:40.119 --> 18:43.664
You know, I ‐‐ I have my
parents' voices in my head, too.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.666
Mm‐hmm.
But they're super positive.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.627
They were constantly telling me
over and over and over

18:47.627 --> 18:49.712
and over again
how smart I was, you know?

18:49.712 --> 18:51.213
But it made me believe

18:51.213 --> 18:53.382
that the way
to make people happy...

18:53.382 --> 18:55.134
is to achieve.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.510
Mm.

18:56.510 --> 18:57.928
Oh.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.389
That's why I'm always telling
people that I'm a doctor!

19:00.389 --> 19:02.683
Ha ha! Yeah!
It's the voice in my head!

19:02.683 --> 19:04.810
Ah.
[ Laughing ]

19:04.810 --> 19:07.772
Well, maybe now that you
realize it, you'll stop.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.441
No.
I'm not hurting anybody.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.984
No, you're just
killing them.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.527
I am not killing people,
Dre.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.779
There's, like, one a year.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.530
And I don't kill them.
They just die.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.032
It's not my fault.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.995
[ Cellphone chimes ]

19:25.122 --> 19:28.167
Oh, wow.
Jack, I am really sorry.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.212
What? Did you make me eat
something that's not food again?

19:31.212 --> 19:34.006
No, somebody from the yearbook
committee leaked your photos.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.174
They're everywhere.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.258
Really?

19:38.386 --> 19:41.472
Oh, no, yo.
They made you a meme.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.515
Gimme that.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.435
This is dope!

19:46.435 --> 19:47.520
Wait. What?!     Wait. What?!

19:47.520 --> 19:49.105
I'm being shared everywhere.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.731
I got to make merch
and an Instagram

19:50.731 --> 19:53.109
where I can localize
all the posts.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.404
Oh, my God.
I could be an NFT.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.072
I'm gonna be a legend!

20:00.616 --> 20:02.576
We do not deserve him.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.621
I've got to figure out
how to screw him out
of that NFT money.

20:05.621 --> 20:09.583
I'm not perfect.
I'm going to make mistakes.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.254
But knowing those mistakes
will become voices in his head

20:13.254 --> 20:15.297
makes the stakes feel too high.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.718
All I'm saying is...
we can be imperfect together

20:18.718 --> 20:20.886
on the path
to getting better.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.388
Alright?
You get me, son?

20:23.389 --> 20:26.225
I love you, Daddy.
Oh.

20:26.225 --> 20:30.020
But as long as one of those
voices is me saying...

20:30.020 --> 20:32.648
I love you, too,
Devante.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.360
...I've done my job
as a parent.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.987
Okay. Go get ready.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.116
I love you, too, Dad.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.160
Don't you have
your own place?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.457
Jack:
When that meme first dropped,

20:49.457 --> 20:50.916
I thought it would die down
in a few days.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.209
But before I knew it,
it took on a life of its own.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.919
I was getting offers
left and right.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.838
My face was on billboards,
they let me dance

20:55.838 --> 20:57.798
at the Puppy Bowl
halftime show,

20:57.798 --> 21:00.801
and I became the co‐host
of a new "Soul Train"

21:00.801 --> 21:03.179
with a hologram Don Cornelius.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.181
The meme
became so popular

21:05.181 --> 21:06.557
that I sold my life rights

21:06.557 --> 21:08.017
to the highest
corporate bidder.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.435
That's how I became
a trillionaire.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.563
And that's also how
you guys got your names,

21:12.563 --> 21:14.857
Sierra Mist
and Mountain Dew.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.486
Anyway, let's take
that warp‐speed jet

21:18.486 --> 21:20.488
to visit Aunt Diane
and Uncle Michael B. Jordan.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.156
Come on.
