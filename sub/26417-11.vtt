WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.903
(slurping)

00:02.936 --> 00:04.905
EVAN: Stop!

00:04.938 --> 00:05.873
JESSICA:
Who called this family meeting?

00:05.906 --> 00:06.907
I can't just sit

00:06.940 --> 00:08.776
and watch Jenny
sip a Bloody Mary all morning.

00:13.547 --> 00:14.915
I don't have time
for this.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.817
I have a PTA auction
I need to organize

00:16.850 --> 00:17.818
with a bunch of ladies

00:17.851 --> 00:19.653
who couldn't find a tail
on a four-assed cat.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.156
That's on top of
the million things

00:22.190 --> 00:23.724
on my usual
to-do list.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.226
And I'm out of town
for a couple days,

00:25.259 --> 00:26.760
so you have to bring
Emery to volleyball.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.729
Don't forget his kneepads and
a bottle of lemon water --

00:28.762 --> 00:30.331
he likes lemon water.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.365
EDDIE: Hit it, G-mah!

00:31.399 --> 00:32.566
(Ja Rule's "Holla Holla"
plays on radio)

00:32.600 --> 00:33.567
* Holla, holla

00:33.601 --> 00:35.336
* Anybody just ready to get

00:35.369 --> 00:36.504
* Dollars, dollars

00:36.537 --> 00:37.838
* Ladies know who can
get 'em a little *

00:37.871 --> 00:39.240
* Hotter, hotter

00:39.273 --> 00:40.708
* Come on, if you rollin'
with me, follow, follow *

00:40.741 --> 00:42.176
Why did I feel the need
to drive in?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.444
Because I'm street legal.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.878
I finished my Driver's Ed,

00:44.912 --> 00:46.380
and I can finally get
my driver's license.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.716
-All right.
-(chuckles)

00:48.749 --> 00:51.752
Oh, wow! (laughs)

00:51.785 --> 00:53.187
I knew he was
gonna drive in.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.522
I saw him setting up.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.023
-Don't make it
about you, Dad.
-It's his day.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.625
* Holla, holla

00:57.658 --> 00:59.193
* Anybody that's ready to get

00:59.227 --> 01:00.361
* Dollars, dollars

01:00.394 --> 01:01.362
* Ladies know who can
get 'em a little *

01:01.395 --> 01:02.363
* Hotter

01:04.765 --> 01:05.899
* Fresh off the boat

01:05.933 --> 01:07.601
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:07.635 --> 01:09.903
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:09.937 --> 01:11.205
* Fresh off the boat

01:11.239 --> 01:13.541
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:13.574 --> 01:14.975
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:15.008 --> 01:17.745
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:23.817 --> 01:25.986
I have never seen you this
excited for taco day before.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.289
I'm just practicing for
my driver's license photo.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.090
What do you think?

01:31.024 --> 01:33.127
You look like a dad
on a roller coaster.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.796
Your driver's license photo
is forever.

01:35.829 --> 01:36.997
You want
to convey confidence.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.266
Step inside the mind
of a bouncer.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.933
I'm sorry,
I'm just really excited about

01:39.967 --> 01:41.302
getting my driver's license.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.770
You're excited?
We're excited!

01:42.803 --> 01:45.273
You're gonna be the first one
of us with a license.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.675
And a van big enough
to drive us all around.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.110
I regret nothing
about that moped.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.346
Except crashing it.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.514
Think about all the things
we'll be able to do

01:53.547 --> 01:54.582
once Eddie can drive.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.617
We can drive
through a car wash.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.353
We can drive
through a bank ATM.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.656
Guys, we can drive
through a drive-thru.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.325
-Oh!
-BAREFOOT DAVE:
And most importantly,

02:04.358 --> 02:06.694
we can drive to
the Insane Clown Posse concert.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.861
I've been sleeping
with those tickets

02:07.895 --> 02:09.930
under my pillow
for a month.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.500
Those Juggalo chicks
are gonna go wild

02:12.533 --> 02:13.834
when they hear
that I walked away

02:13.867 --> 02:15.269
from a moped wreck.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.309
Oh, hey.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.877
The PTA is fundraising
for a new computer lab,

02:23.911 --> 02:25.145
and I need a moneymaker

02:25.179 --> 02:27.114
that's gonna push
this auction over the top.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.782
How do you feel about

02:28.816 --> 02:31.185
a "win a date with
the PTA president"?

02:31.219 --> 02:32.486
Sure, whatever,
anything for the kids.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.455
Do you think I need
to bring floss on this trip?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.489
No, right?
Marvin will probably bring some.

02:35.523 --> 02:36.490
He's a dentist.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.625
-Remind me again

02:37.658 --> 02:39.960
why you're surprising Marvin
with a trip.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.962
Marvin's been straight out
since the baby came.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.564
He and I are due for
some boy time,

02:43.597 --> 02:44.965
and there is
no better place than

02:44.998 --> 02:47.668
the annual Chili Con Conference
in Panama City.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.672
(sighs)
You're right.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.707
I can't
auction myself off.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.410
The auction thermometer
only goes to $10,000.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.512
All right,
who's taking me to the DMV?

02:58.546 --> 02:59.747
It's time to get laminated.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.415
-Sorry, I'm going
to surprise Marvin

03:01.449 --> 03:02.816
with a trip to Chili Con.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.851
If you don't want to take me,
that's fine.

03:03.884 --> 03:04.918
You don't have to lie.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.855
I don't lie about chili.
I eat it.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.158
Moms, you feeling
like a DMV run?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.159
JESSICA: Nope.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.927
I already have to take Emery
to volleyball,

03:13.961 --> 03:15.563
Evan to fencing,
pick up some groceries,

03:15.596 --> 03:16.897
and run this PTA auction

03:16.930 --> 03:18.499
to build you
a new computer lab.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.567
Come on, Mom,
I can't do donuts

03:19.600 --> 03:21.435
around the Mervyn's parking lot
on a computer!

03:21.469 --> 03:24.071
We can't just drop everything
because you have something.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.406
We'll get to it
eventually.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.376
The DMV
isn't going anywhere.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.377
(door opens, closes)

03:29.410 --> 03:31.879
Ah, I'm gonna grab the floss
just in case.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.084
-You ready?
-(chuckles)

03:37.117 --> 03:39.520
The anticipation's
killing me, Lou.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.521
(both laugh)

03:40.554 --> 03:41.622
Where are we going?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.391
-I love surprises.
-I know.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.025
It's like you think
something's gonna happen,

03:45.058 --> 03:47.194
then something completely
different happens.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.195
Yep.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.263
Please tell him, Louis.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.100
-(gasps)
-LOUIS: We are going

03:53.133 --> 03:55.035
to the Chili Con
Conference...

03:55.068 --> 03:57.070
-Oh!
-...in the heart of
the Redneck Riviera,

03:57.104 --> 03:58.071
Panama City.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.139
I scored us passes

03:59.172 --> 04:00.974
that get us into
the cornbread after-party.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.311
Oh, the Chili Con
Conference...

04:03.344 --> 04:05.479
Whoa!

04:05.513 --> 04:06.714
I'm glad you're
as pumped as I am

04:06.747 --> 04:09.417
because I booked us a double
room at the Airport HoJo.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.784
They have
an indoor pool.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.620
-Ooh.
-Oh, that does
sound amazing.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.222
-Right?!
-You got room for one more?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.490
'Cause this sounds
too good to pass up!

04:16.524 --> 04:18.225
-Wait, what?
-Chili?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.428
My two favorite guys?
The open road?

04:20.461 --> 04:21.795
You're checking
all my boxes, Louis.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.230
MARVIN: It might be nice
to have someone

04:23.263 --> 04:25.299
who can go on a late-night
antacid run for us

04:25.333 --> 04:26.634
in case we blow it out.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.436
-(chuckles)
-Well, I only have two passes,

04:28.469 --> 04:29.937
and they were pretty hard
to come by.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.171
Oh, I don't need a pass.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.806
I've seen Dave Matthews
over 40 times.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.907
I've never
bought a ticket.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.443
Um, well,
what about Maria?

04:35.476 --> 04:37.277
Oh, we found this
great new babysitter.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.946
It's a he!

04:38.979 --> 04:41.148
But I only made two aprons,

04:41.181 --> 04:42.282
and we're leaving right now.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.484
There's no time
for you to pack.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.185
Oh, I have a go-bag
in the car.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.954
Panama City!

04:46.987 --> 04:49.189
-Ha! Let's go, bitches!
-MARVIN: (laughs)

04:49.222 --> 04:52.860
(chuckles, sighs)

04:52.893 --> 04:54.628
How about some tunes?

04:54.662 --> 04:57.698
-No radio, it wastes gas.
-How 'bout some air back here?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.099
No vents for me.
I'm cold.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.768
'Cause you're wearing
that skimpy outfit.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.135
If you were playing
a gentleman's sport,

05:02.169 --> 05:04.137
-like fencing --
-Gentleman's sport?

05:04.171 --> 05:05.773
Volleyball is played
in the royal court!

05:05.806 --> 05:07.207
Can we get
a fact check?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.209
Fact --
You guys are lame.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.444
(sword twangs)

05:10.478 --> 05:11.445
Ow!

05:11.479 --> 05:12.480
Evan hit me with
his needle sword.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.881
It's an epee!

05:13.914 --> 05:15.148
(both grunt)

05:15.182 --> 05:17.651
-Stop!
-JESSICA:
If you don't knock it off,

05:17.685 --> 05:19.387
I swear I will
turn this car around.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.723
You missed the turn
for the DMV!

05:22.756 --> 05:25.292
I'll take you after
I finish my errands.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.627
I'm your firstborn.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.995
I should be
your first priority.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.797
Oh, you are.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.799
I have to buy groceries
so yo can eat,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.368
return your white-people-are-
bad-at-jumping video

05:34.402 --> 05:35.736
before we get charged,

05:35.769 --> 05:40.007
and then plan a PTA auction
to raise funds for your school.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.479
This list
makes no sense.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.714
The DMV is right there.

05:46.747 --> 05:47.848
You could take me now

05:47.881 --> 05:49.483
and still have time to finish
all this by dinner.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.485
Gah, Mom, why do you have
to make things harder?

05:51.519 --> 05:52.753
It's so easy.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.188
(exhales sharply)

05:57.425 --> 05:58.759
Fine.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.594
Let's go to the DMV.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.663
* Yeah

06:02.696 --> 06:03.664
(camera shutter clicks)

06:05.466 --> 06:06.600
I'm finally free!

06:06.634 --> 06:07.835
Yep, you're free.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.136
Free to do all this...

06:10.938 --> 06:12.773
But, Mom, I'm supposed to hang
with the crew tonight.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.342
You can still spend time with
your ragtag group of friends.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.610
-How?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.546
You told me I could have this
all done by dinner.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.581
You said it was
"so easy" for me.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.783
I see what
you're doing here,

06:22.816 --> 06:24.351
and I accept
your challenge,

06:24.384 --> 06:25.919
if you could even
call it that.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.020
Great.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.856
Well, now I can spend
all my time on the PTA auction.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.357
-Fine.
-Great.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.592
-Fine.
-Great.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.626
-Fine.
-Great.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.861
-Fine.
-Great.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.564
-Fine!
-Great!

06:39.099 --> 06:41.068
Okay, Meatball.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.269
We've got
a lot of work to do

06:42.302 --> 06:45.606
to fix whatever it is you did
to the PTA fundraiser.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.140
It's Jamie.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.610
I brought meatballs
to the HOA once.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.979
And you don't
have to worry

06:52.012 --> 06:56.584
because I found the crown jewel
of our auction --

06:56.617 --> 07:00.554
my homemade
baby-corn earrings.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.789
They're farm-to-ear.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.791
Those will raise
one dollar.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.626
We need
a big-ticket item,

07:05.659 --> 07:07.461
and I've already
taken care of it --

07:07.495 --> 07:10.898
George Foreman's
prototype outdoor grill.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.966
Only one in existence.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.435
It uses methane as fuel.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.775
I also have
a snap-pea anklet.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.811
Everyone looks great
in green.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.513
Okay, whatever it is
you're working through,

07:25.546 --> 07:26.914
-I need you to get
to the other side...

07:26.947 --> 07:28.148
(door opens)
-...before the auction.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.550
-Boom, suckas!

07:31.318 --> 07:32.853
Oh, you did everything?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.588
Told you...easy.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.424
He even got to my fencing
practice early.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.993
Saw him gabbing with all
the other moms while he waited.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.629
Turns out, Shelly's cat died

07:41.662 --> 07:43.030
the same day
her husband left her.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.032
Her goldfish
better watch out.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.466
These things
happen in threes.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.769
Not in my family.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.903
(voice breaking)
It happens in fives.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.974
-Wait. Where are the groceries?
-They're there.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.943
Nope. They are not.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.477
(sighs) I forgot.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.180
I tried on Evan's mask,
and I couldn't get it off.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.882
I-I must've
gotten distracted.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.183
We'll just
pick them up tomorrow.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.554
Tomorrow has its own to-do list,
as does the rest of the week.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.555
What do you think
those are?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.622
I never really
look over there.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.558
I just go fridge
and I'm out.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.559
Well,
the fridge is empty,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.694
and those groceries
were for dinner tonight.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.728
If I go
to the store now,

08:14.762 --> 08:16.129
I'll miss hanging out
with my friends.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.531
You want your brothers
to starve?

08:17.565 --> 08:18.966
No. Fine.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.068
I'll just whip something up
with the stuff we have here.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.738
(sighs)

08:24.772 --> 08:26.339
My first one
with his license.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.975
Thinks he runs
the world.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.344
Ugh, I remember when Jamie Jr.
got his boat license.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.647
You did not want to be
a duck on that lake.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.929
Whoo! Chili Con '99!

08:48.962 --> 08:49.930
You did it.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.531
You got right in here
without a badge,

08:51.565 --> 08:52.600
you little minx.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.001
Oh, it wasn't hard.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.335
No one was even checking,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.404
which is a shame 'cause
I was really looking forward

08:57.437 --> 08:59.707
to breaking out the old
Honey flash-n-dash.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.842
-What?
-Oh.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.276
You pose for a picture
with the ticket guy

09:03.310 --> 09:04.945
and then when he's blinded
by the flash,

09:04.978 --> 09:06.413
you dash inside.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.115
-Right. Thank God.
-Just what I thought it was.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.382
(chuckles)

09:09.416 --> 09:10.684
Hey, Marvin,
check out this chili.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.885
It has your favorite pepper
in it --

09:11.919 --> 09:13.854
the ghost pepper.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.423
Yeah, I see it there
on the chalkboard.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.726
All right, two samples
for the ghostbusters?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.360
(chuckles) We'll try
not to cross our spoons.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.394
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles)

09:23.396 --> 09:25.265
Mmm.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.067
Hotsie-totsie.
She's got a kick.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.636
-Hit this, Marv.
-Ooh.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.803
LOUIS: Oh, careful, rookie.

09:29.837 --> 09:30.771
This is the big leagues.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.940
Mmm.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.074
Meh, I've had hotter.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.576
Uh...well, then, I'll just
wait for the next one.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.445
Want to save my taste buds
for the really hot stuff.

09:38.478 --> 09:39.446
-(chuckles)
-(chuckles)

09:39.479 --> 09:40.614
Hey, uh, Honey,

09:40.648 --> 09:42.750
we're gonna be on this
chili train for a few hours,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.051
so if you want
to go get a nap in,

09:44.084 --> 09:45.452
no one would blame you.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.721
Can't just eat for two,
gotta sleep for two, am I right?

09:47.755 --> 09:48.722
-(chuckles)
-Are you kidding?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.257
I am wide awake.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.759
MARVIN: (chuckles)
Hey, you know, actually,

09:51.792 --> 09:52.926
a nap sounds like
a pretty good idea,

09:52.960 --> 09:55.395
and you two seem to have
everything under control.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.463
-(chuckles)
-Whoo.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.597
But you slept
the whole ride here.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.399
I never hit REM, Louis.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.468
Hey, show her
the bread section.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.535
She loves bread.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.339
HONEY:
Looks like it's just us.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.075
So tell me about
this bread section.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.144
It's over there
where the bread is.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.850
Dinner is served, losers.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.519
-Mmm, this is great.
-Ramen and cut-up hot dogs?

10:19.552 --> 10:20.921
EVAN: No, thank you.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.022
I'm not gonna taint my palate.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.123
Tomato season's coming.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.358
Hang on,
I'm not even done yet.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.997
No cool ranch for --

10:30.030 --> 10:31.832
Hmm, oh, well.

10:31.865 --> 10:32.866
(French accent)
Bon appétit, losers.

10:32.900 --> 10:33.934
(normal voice)
That's French for "losers."

10:33.967 --> 10:36.136
I'm gonna go hang out
with my friends.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.272
Wait, what about
the mess you made?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.541
This is a one-pan meal
at most.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.843
I had a few misfires.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.311
Well, you have
to clean it up.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.146
Me?
Why are you always on me?

10:46.179 --> 10:48.782
Evan and Emery just got
a free, delicious meal.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.183
Ha. (scoffs)

10:50.217 --> 10:51.184
Make them clean it up.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.652
I'm supposed to go
hang with my friends.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.854
Sorry, Eddie,
it's a school night.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.488
You will see
your friends tomorrow.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.290
Besides, I need
to drive Meatball home.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.726
She rolled her ankle.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.831
(indistinct conversations)

11:03.864 --> 11:05.398
Hey, hey!

11:05.432 --> 11:06.967
You ready for
some breakfast chili?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.168
Where's Marvin?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.170
He knows they start
the burners at 8:00 A.M. sharp.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.172
Air Force One.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.874
Marvin has
a hard travel rule

11:13.907 --> 11:15.843
that if Air Force One
is on TV at a hotel,

11:15.876 --> 11:17.010
he has to watch it.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.645
But this is our trip.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.680
We're supposed to spend the day
slinging beans,

11:20.714 --> 11:22.883
fighting heartburn,
fanning our tongues!

11:22.916 --> 11:24.985
Oh, I-I'm sure
he'll be down in a bit.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.887
In the meantime,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.922
there is a German ladle
manufacturer here.

11:28.956 --> 11:32.659
The seminar is called
"Ladle-weiss."

11:32.692 --> 11:34.427
You know, like from
The Sound of Music?

11:34.461 --> 11:36.196
Yeah, sorry,
it's hard for me

11:36.229 --> 11:38.398
to enjoy a chili pun
without Marvin.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.167
Oh, don't take it
personally.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.534
He just needs a break.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.870
He said he's
all chili-ed out.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.271
"Chili-ed out"?!
(scoffs)

11:44.304 --> 11:45.705
Once, I saw him get
a bloody nose,

11:45.739 --> 11:47.240
but it was actually
chili coming out.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.109
Well, he'll get
a second wind.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.078
Come on, we can still
make the seminar.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.612
Better ladle
than never.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.915
You know what,
save me a seat.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.083
I'm gonna run
to the restroom.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.218
Oof.
Chili Con bathroom?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.619
Brave.
(chuckles)

12:04.657 --> 12:07.294
MARVIN:
Oh, come on, Clinton!

12:07.327 --> 12:08.796
Give us a wave.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.297
(chuckles)

12:12.332 --> 12:14.234
(gasps) Marvin?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.936
How could you?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.237
It's not what it
looks like, Lou.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.872
No amount of sour cream

12:18.906 --> 12:21.108
could wash out
the taste of betrayal!

12:21.141 --> 12:22.109
But --

12:22.142 --> 12:23.276
Lou!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.548
JESSICA: Hey!

12:28.581 --> 12:29.582
Where do you think
you're going?

12:29.616 --> 12:30.750
To the concert
with my friends.

12:30.784 --> 12:31.885
I got permission
weeks ago.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.753
That was before
this happened.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.624
Whoa, you've got puberty
all over your face.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.759
It's not zits!
It's hives!

12:39.793 --> 12:42.729
Apparently, he's allergic
to cool ranch chips.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.798
Well, how was I supposed
to know that?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.433
Well, now I need to take Emery
to the doctor,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.936
which means you have to take
Evan to his fencing tournament,

12:48.969 --> 12:49.937
pick up the grill,

12:49.970 --> 12:51.571
and drop it off
at the PTA auction.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.140
I can't.
I promised my friends --

12:53.173 --> 12:55.508
This wouldn't have happened if
you had picked up the groceries

12:55.542 --> 12:56.643
like you said you would.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.914
My name
is Inigo Montoya,

13:00.948 --> 13:03.984
you killed my father,
prepare to die.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.156
-Mommy takes a different way.
-Well, I'm not Mommy.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.292
WALTER: Can we get a little
AC back here?

13:12.325 --> 13:13.660
Yeah, my makeup's
starting to bleed.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.762
I wouldn't mind some hype music
to get me in the zone.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.464
No radio.
It wastes the gas.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.099
And you'll get plenty of music
once I get Evan to his match,

13:19.132 --> 13:20.934
drop the grill off
at school,

13:20.968 --> 13:22.702
and get us
to the ICP concert.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.504
Can someone explain to me
what "ICP" is?

13:24.537 --> 13:26.539
Hey, Eddie,
can we pull over?

13:26.573 --> 13:27.774
My bladder's singin'.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.509
Mine, too.
I need to rain sunshine.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.710
Savages.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.946
This George Foreman grill
is jabbing my sides.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.181
Like boxer, like grill.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.482
Still not feeling any airflow!

13:35.515 --> 13:36.549
If you don't knock it off,

13:36.583 --> 13:38.285
I swear I will turn
this car around!

13:41.521 --> 13:42.956
Aw, hell no.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.392
Walter, give me some
of that clown makeup.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.827
We're going straight
to the ICP concert.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.364
(boys chanting "ICP!")

13:51.398 --> 13:52.565
Don't do it, Evan.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.601
Don't stress-sweat
into your whites.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.071
(crowd cheering, shouting)

13:58.105 --> 13:59.706
(glass shatters)

13:59.739 --> 14:01.308
(crowd shouting)

14:01.341 --> 14:05.312
(music plays in distance)

14:05.345 --> 14:07.514
EVAN: Technically, this could be
considered kidnapping.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.316
EDDIE:
First, kids can't kidnap.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.750
Second, this is Florida.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.553
And third, I promised
the crew I was taking
them to this concert

14:13.586 --> 14:15.222
long before
I was saddled with you.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.225
That guy's throwing punches
with a needle in his arm.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.427
Seven clowns just came out
of that one porta-potty.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.029
Is that a pierced --

14:22.062 --> 14:23.596
Yes, yes it is.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.232
Someone's gonna die tonight!
Yeah!

14:25.265 --> 14:27.334
(crowd shouting)

14:27.367 --> 14:28.601
Evan, stay close to me.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.671
Evan?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.073
Evan?!

14:33.106 --> 14:34.241
Evan!!

14:34.274 --> 14:36.076
Okay.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.344
Stay right here.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.779
People will donate more
when they see how sick you look.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.780
But I feel fine.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.682
(quietly)
Don't tell people that.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.585
The auctioneer is here,
and he's warming up.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.387
Mommy made me
mash my M&M's.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.421
Unique New York,
unique New York.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.123
Each leech must
reach the beach.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.592
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.562
Where do they
find these people?

14:55.595 --> 14:56.896
That's my husband.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.798
I'm sorry.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.600
My boy is so sick.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.636
Oh. Well, I don't mean
to upset you more,

15:03.670 --> 15:05.705
but the George Foreman grill
isn't here.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.940
What?!

15:06.974 --> 15:08.141
Damn it, Eddie!

15:08.175 --> 15:09.642
That was
our big-ticket item!

15:09.676 --> 15:10.978
Don't worry.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.213
My jewelry box
is in the trunk,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.881
and I've got
a green bean necklace

15:14.914 --> 15:16.883
that's a real
pocketbook-opener.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.418
Ooh!

15:22.789 --> 15:25.625
Wow, Chili Con and Paisley Fest
on the same weekend?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.660
You guys must be
raking it in.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.496
Hey, Lou.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.498
I've been looking
all over for you.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.067
Why? So you can run off
and eat chili alone again?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.003
-I can explain.
-No need.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.405
I knew you weren't
all "chili-ed out."

15:38.438 --> 15:40.007
Why have you
been avoiding me?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.342
It's not you, Lou.
It's me.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.111
I just found out I have
a medical condition,

15:44.144 --> 15:46.746
and I was too embarrassed
to tell you.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.615
I have the E.D.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.151
-E.D.?
-E.D.!

15:51.184 --> 15:54.454
That's why Honey joined
our boys' trip.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.523
You guys are working through
your erectile dysfunction

15:56.556 --> 15:58.191
and wanted to try
and spice it up.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.327
Erectile dysfunction?

16:00.360 --> 16:01.528
No!

16:01.561 --> 16:03.630
If anything,
I have the opposite problem.

16:03.663 --> 16:07.300
(chuckles) No,
extreme diverticulitis.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.368
E.D.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.603
Ohh. (chuckles)

16:10.637 --> 16:12.505
-MARVIN: (chuckles)
-Wait, what?

16:12.539 --> 16:16.676
My intestines can't process
small beans and seeds.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.878
But I just caught you
eating chili.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.548
Yeah, Texas chili...
beanless.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.116
-Ugh.
-Yeah.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.185
It's a sad substitute
for real chili.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.686
But why didn't you
tell me?

16:26.719 --> 16:29.156
Well, you put so much
thought into this trip,

16:29.189 --> 16:30.523
and with
the second baby coming,

16:30.557 --> 16:32.225
who knows how much time
we'll have to hang out?

16:32.259 --> 16:35.695
And Honey came along just so
she could run cover for me.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.130
Still, I'm your best friend.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.866
-I would've understood.
-MARVIN: Yeah, well...

16:39.899 --> 16:41.401
the doc said my E.D.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.437
is caused by
Szechuan peppercorns.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.640
That's the fourth alarm
in my chili.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.675
Yeah.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.143
I caused your intestines
to fail?!

16:50.177 --> 16:52.479
(stammering) That's not
the way to look at it, Lou.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.981
The way I see it, it's a --
it's a badge of honor.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.850
I've beaten every chili
in the world,

16:57.884 --> 16:58.985
except yours.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.155
I'm sorry I gave you E.D.,
buddy.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.556
(both laugh)

17:03.590 --> 17:04.757
But we'll find
something new.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.493
-The world is our oyster.
-Yeah.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.427
(gasps)

17:07.460 --> 17:08.828
The Oyster Boysters!

17:08.861 --> 17:10.230
-(laughs)
-Huh?

17:10.263 --> 17:11.398
We'll keep thinking.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.532
(both laugh)

17:12.565 --> 17:14.867
Paisley Fest!

17:14.901 --> 17:17.304
Flash-n-dash
works every time.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.274
(indistinct shouting,
glass breaking in distance)
-EDDIE: Evan!

17:21.308 --> 17:24.611
Evan!

17:24.644 --> 17:26.513
Evan. (stammers)

17:26.546 --> 17:28.515
Excuse me, have you
seen a small kid

17:28.548 --> 17:30.183
wearing all white,
holding a sword?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.119
There's a kid who pointed out
a spelling error

17:32.152 --> 17:34.221
-on my concert tee.
-That's him!

17:34.254 --> 17:36.423
Yo.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.092
Do you know where
the nearest bus stop is?

17:39.126 --> 17:41.261
Dude! You cannot
walk away like that.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.630
You scared me to death.
We're going back to the van.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.132
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.366
Look around.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.734
We're in hell.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.702
You're my responsibility,
Bro.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.937
Doesn't seem like it.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.140
Seems like you only care
about what you want.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.075
Oh, really? I've been driving
you around the past two days.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.377
I even made you dinner!

17:57.410 --> 17:58.611
Never even heard a thank you.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.079
Do you hear yourself?

18:00.113 --> 18:02.282
Mom drives you around
every day.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.616
She does everything
for you.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.084
She took you to get
your driver's license

18:05.118 --> 18:07.086
and you didn't
say squat.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.222
Don't worry,
I never thanked my mom,

18:09.256 --> 18:10.757
and I turned out fine.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.126
Come on.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.327
I need to find the guys

18:14.361 --> 18:15.328
so I can tell them

18:15.362 --> 18:16.996
I'm taking you to
your fencing tournament.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.931
We don't need
to look that hard.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.667
(indistinct shouting,
glass breaking)

18:20.700 --> 18:23.836
I don't need
to pee anymore.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.339
I can't believe it.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.242
Thanks to Eddie, we're stuck
with this hot garbage.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.110
And now for the big-ticket item
of the night --

18:31.144 --> 18:33.280
handcrafted
vegetable jewelry,

18:33.313 --> 18:35.148
which has taken over
my home office.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.918
Our model, Jamie, is sporting
a pair of baby-corn earrings

18:38.951 --> 18:41.020
to match her cherry tomato
watchband.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.054
Do I hear
an opening bid?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.258
Let's start
the bidding at $10.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.426
$10, bidder looking.
$20, $10. Bidder looking, $20.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.760
Come on, folks.
Open up your wallets.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.462
This is for the kids.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.431
I need an opening bid
at $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.765
$5, bidder, bidder,
looking for $10.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.434
$5. Kids need
a new computer lab.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.503
-We're losing money here.
-AUCTIONEER: Just $5, folks.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.604
(stamps foot, sighs)

18:57.637 --> 18:59.439
-How about $4.75, $4.50?
-Okay, can it, Meatballs.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.707
(feedback whines)

19:00.740 --> 19:01.708
Sorry, folks,

19:01.741 --> 19:02.842
that was just a glimpse

19:02.875 --> 19:04.110
into the last five weeks
of my life

19:04.143 --> 19:05.545
planning this night,

19:05.578 --> 19:09.982
but now for the real big-ticket
item of the evening --

19:10.016 --> 19:11.150
a date with me!

19:11.184 --> 19:13.019
You and I will enjoy dinner

19:13.052 --> 19:14.887
at a five-star restaurant
of my choosing

19:14.921 --> 19:16.289
for no more than an hour.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.158
We won't talk sports, religion,
politics, or pop culture.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.293
I will be reading a book.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.462
Of my own choosing.
That I wrote.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.998
Okay, let's start the bidding
at $100,000.

19:26.032 --> 19:30.837
(imitating auctioneering)

19:30.870 --> 19:32.138
This is for the kids, folks.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.706
And I'm gonna talk fast...

19:33.740 --> 19:34.807
(imitating auctioneering)

19:34.841 --> 19:36.243
(door opens)

19:36.276 --> 19:37.410
JESSICA:
(imitating auctioneering)

19:37.444 --> 19:38.911
There you are!

19:38.945 --> 19:40.547
Okay, Meatballs,
you're back in.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.914
Where have you been?

19:41.948 --> 19:43.650
I went to the concert
with my friends.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.585
-What?!
-EDDIE:
And then I came back here.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.720
I know I've been complaining
about everything

19:47.754 --> 19:49.322
you've made me do
the past two days,

19:49.356 --> 19:51.524
and then I realized
you've been doing this for me

19:51.558 --> 19:52.592
my whole life.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.494
That's what being a mom is.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.229
Yeah, I didn't realize that

19:56.263 --> 19:57.930
until I drove a mile
in your shoes.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.266
So, thank you.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.501
I didn't mean
to heap all that on you,

20:01.534 --> 20:04.904
but I want you to understand
what responsibility really is.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.674
I'm sorry
I made it so difficult.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.410
You're not any more difficult
than Evan or Emery.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.179
I know that you think
I'm harder on you than them,

20:13.212 --> 20:14.781
but that's just 'cause
you're the first.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.049
Anytime you're figuring out
something new,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.251
so are we.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.552
So I'm a trailblazer!

20:19.586 --> 20:21.454
Your father and I
call you a guinea pig.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.055
Fair.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.957
In the future,
I'll try to make it easier.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.294
Mm. I can't promise
that I will.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.030
-AUCTIONEER: Thank you so much.
-Were you auctioning yourself?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.064
(sighs) Yes.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.601
I'm sorry you had
to witness those jackals

20:34.634 --> 20:35.868
fighting over your mother,

20:35.902 --> 20:39.105
but let's see how much
these horn-dogs pay for a grill.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.541
AUCTIONEER: This is an XL grill.
Let's see XL prices.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.576
$150, bidder, bidder.
Looking at $150 right here.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.413
$175. Good! $200, there. $200,
$225, bidder looking, $250.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.653
(indistinct talking
through speaker)

20:53.686 --> 20:55.054
EDDIE: Can I get
two large sodas?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.055
Diet for me.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.590
Trying to watch
my fencing figure.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.626
Do we think it's safe
to eat fish here?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.227
They better not be
out of curly fries.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.261
Pigtails.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.564
Make sure they put
plenty of catsup in the bag!

21:04.597 --> 21:05.732
What are you,
the Queen of England?!

21:05.765 --> 21:06.899
It's ketchup.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.601
Guys, just give me your order!
We don't have all night!

21:08.635 --> 21:10.903
Can I get a cheeseburger?
Cheese on the side.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.172
Anyone wanna go halfsies
on the soft serve?

21:13.205 --> 21:14.507
I only like the cone.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.575
Oh, I should
get my mom fries.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.610
WALTER: Ask if they have
any old burger buns.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.912
-Seagull bait!
-Don't get too attached
to your order.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.481
This place
will blow it.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.982
TRENT:
Last time I came here...

21:23.015 --> 21:24.784
I don't know how you do it.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.453
I yell a lot.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.459
