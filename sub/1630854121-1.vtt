07:01.255 --> 07:04.648
pancreatic cancer
is usually fatal.

07:04.666 --> 07:06.149
But your tumor was operable,

07:06.151 --> 07:07.259
your nodes were clear

07:07.410 --> 07:09.928
and there's no evidence
of metastasis.

07:10.079 --> 07:11.263
But there could still be

07:11.490 --> 07:13.247
residual cancer cells
that no test can see.

07:13.341 --> 07:16.993
Yes, but you've had postsurgical
chemo and radiation,

07:17.086 --> 07:19.679
uh, you haven't
developed diabetes,

07:19.831 --> 07:21.773

08:52.849 --> 08:54.181
Maybe it's preeclampsia.

-GABBI: I'll be right back.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.568
♪ ♪

10:56.731 --> 10:58.305
Who's the president right now?

10:58.400 --> 11:01.993
Um, I don't really follow
politics, to tell you the truth.

11:02.145 --> 11:04.570
I'm... I suffer
from fragile sanity.

11:04.723 --> 11:05.997
Eh, take a guess.

11:06.074 --> 11:08.224
Uh, I know
it's not Jimmy Carter.

11:08.317 --> 11:09.834
Do I get a point for that?

11:09.986 --> 11:11.227
No. No, I'm afraid not.

11:11.246 --> 11:14.989
Oh, um, I forgot
to tell you, um...

11:15.008 --> 11:17.509
lately, I've had the memory
of a goldfish

11:17.660 --> 11:19.419
-with a drinking problem.
-Squeeze my hands.
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

11:19.571 --> 11:21.846
And I've been chalking it up
to not getting any sleep.

11:21.998 --> 11:23.406
-Do you have insomnia?
-No.

11:23.425 --> 11:26.393
I don't want to sleep
because of the nightmares.

11:28.096 --> 11:30.230
-What kind of nightmares?
-Uh...

11:30.932 --> 11:34.434
...usually I'm trapped

11:34.586 --> 11:36.602
in this water,

11:36.697 --> 11:38.512
no sound.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.424
(breathing erratically)

11:41.443 --> 11:43.243
(groans)

11:51.360 --> 11:52.877
Why didn't you page me
for a consult sooner?

11:53.104 --> 11:53.953
We were waiting for

11:54.105 --> 11:55.104
the tox screen to come back.

11:55.198 --> 11:56.773
Then Ciara decompensated
rapidly.

11:56.775 --> 11:58.550
CADE:
It wasn't initially clear
it was neurological.

11:58.701 --> 11:59.959
Conrad thought it was.

12:00.111 --> 12:02.595
-It's my bad.
-(pager beeps)

12:04.616 --> 12:06.391
We've got this
if you're needed in the ER.

12:06.618 --> 12:10.562
-I hate to go. Keep me posted?
-CONRAD: Yeah.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.607
(door opens, closes)

12:18.129 --> 12:20.221
-How's Gigi?
-The same.

12:20.298 --> 12:21.722
She had another nightmare.

12:21.816 --> 12:23.466
-Oh. I'm worried.
-Me too.

12:23.635 --> 12:25.744
I know when I was alone
with her on Saturday,

12:25.895 --> 12:27.245
she refused to nap.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.414
I tried to get her to talk
about the bad dreams

12:29.565 --> 12:31.249
and what they're about,
but she wouldn't say.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.585
Do you think this could
have anything to do

12:33.736 --> 12:34.753
with Nic's death?

12:34.904 --> 12:36.570
Yeah, maybe.
It's possible.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.999
But Gigi was a tiny baby
when Nic died. I mean,

12:40.151 --> 12:41.575
she thinks of Nic
as her guardian angel

12:41.669 --> 12:43.577
-looking out for her.
-Yeah, but trauma

12:43.671 --> 12:45.171
can take years to manifest.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.173
I don't know any other reason
why she'd be afraid.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.842
Yeah, I mean, you control
her screens and play dates.

12:49.995 --> 12:51.919
Turn off the news.

12:52.013 --> 12:53.605
I protect her with my life.

13:01.264 --> 13:02.614
-Conrad.
-This is brutal,

13:02.765 --> 13:05.008
seeing her like this.

13:05.101 --> 13:09.270
I can't stop it.
Can't help.

13:09.364 --> 13:12.791
Fixing things like this
is supposed to be my job.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.543
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.025
You're a great dad
and a great diagnostician.

13:22.043 --> 13:24.527
You'll get to the bottom
of this.

13:24.546 --> 13:26.429
Thank you.

13:29.458 --> 13:33.228
I don't know what I'd do
without your support.

13:35.056 --> 13:37.065
(monitor beeping)

13:38.543 --> 13:41.394
Okay, well, there's
our problem.

13:41.546 --> 13:44.063
Our talented chef has a mass
roughly the size of a marble

13:44.140 --> 13:46.991
located between the temporal
lobe and the cerebellum.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.234
-Causing all her symptoms.
-Yeah, we're gonna

13:48.386 --> 13:49.902
have to operate
to figure out what it is.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.890
It's dangerously situated
near the brain stem.

13:53.908 --> 13:55.725
Let's get informed consent.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.502
Yeah.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.253
Thank you.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.907
Wow. You've all done
an incredible job

14:10.925 --> 14:12.258
with the resources we have.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.335
Everybody has been working
around the clock

14:14.429 --> 14:16.762
to meet our deadline
for the diabetes trial.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.189
Well, thank you.

14:18.341 --> 14:20.750
As you know, clinical trials
are crucial, not just

14:20.768 --> 14:23.086
for our patients, but for the
health of the hospital, too.

14:23.179 --> 14:25.029
DEVON:
And there's an election
coming up.

14:25.256 --> 14:27.181
We may get a new governor
who plans

14:27.200 --> 14:30.093
to slash our budget
$200 million.

14:30.186 --> 14:33.096
Imagine voting for someone
who attacks health care.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.072
Yet he's polling to win.

14:35.299 --> 14:36.875
Well, the steady stream
of clinical trials--

14:37.060 --> 14:38.692
it'll help keep us solvent.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.436
I can't pretend I don't wish

14:40.529 --> 14:42.881
we had the kind of facilities
other labs offer.

14:43.108 --> 14:46.033
Kit, I am confident
in what we created here,

14:46.127 --> 14:47.960
and I know that we're gonna
get the job done.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.612
(phone rings)

14:49.705 --> 14:52.724
It's Lewis Varner
from Varner Scientific,

14:52.875 --> 14:55.376
-sponsor of our trial.
-Oh. Okay.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.455
I'm so glad you called, Lewis.
I have great news.

14:59.474 --> 15:03.401
The lab is up and running,
and we can't wait to start.

15:03.552 --> 15:05.528
(phone vibrating)

15:07.908 --> 15:09.982
Uh, Lewis, this is a mistake.

15:10.135 --> 15:12.744
Can we at least discuss it?

15:12.895 --> 15:15.229
I see. Well, thank you

15:15.398 --> 15:16.915
for letting me know
in a timely fashion.

15:17.066 --> 15:18.899
I-If anything changes,

15:18.919 --> 15:21.811
if there's anything
I can say or do, uh...

15:21.813 --> 15:24.464
Yes. I hear you.

15:25.833 --> 15:28.651
Well, good luck with everything.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.319
What is it?

15:30.338 --> 15:33.747
For this trial,
they've decided to partner

15:33.767 --> 15:36.768
with Baltimore Advanced Sciences

15:36.919 --> 15:38.828
because of their
superior facilities.

15:38.921 --> 15:41.013
So they're cancelling our trial.

15:41.107 --> 15:44.000
Yes. There will be
other trials, I hope.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.668
I-I'm sure.

15:46.354 --> 15:47.779
We have to talk
about this later.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.355
I have to go.
There's a

15:49.507 --> 15:51.616
problem with
Padma's pregnancy.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.025
Oh, no. What is it?

15:53.178 --> 15:54.869
I'm on my way to find out.

15:56.197 --> 15:58.848
The ultrasound is diagnostic,
there is no doubt,

15:58.850 --> 16:00.366
but I can help.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.352
Well, given how bad this is,
I'm having trouble handling it.

16:03.371 --> 16:05.688
And this is gonna
be brutal for Padma.

16:05.781 --> 16:06.947
She's quite fragile.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.782
You have to be careful
how you tell her.

16:08.876 --> 16:10.468
Breaking the news
is just the beginning.

16:10.619 --> 16:13.137
I've done it many times.
You can trust me to handle it.

16:13.364 --> 16:15.381
-With your help.
-DEVON: Hey.

16:15.533 --> 16:18.367
I came as fast as I could.
What's happening?

16:18.386 --> 16:21.229
Dr. Sullivan is getting ready
to explain.

16:29.230 --> 16:32.231
Hi, Padma.
I'm Dr. Ian Sullivan,

16:32.383 --> 16:35.809
a pediatric surgeon
specializing in fetal medicine.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.478
Oh, my God.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.572
Please don't let there
be anything wrong.

16:39.724 --> 16:43.668
Dr. Sullivan is an expert
in exactly what the twins need.

16:43.819 --> 16:46.504
Tell me.
What's happening?

16:48.174 --> 16:51.843
Sometimes when babies
are growing in the womb,

16:52.070 --> 16:54.237
the process takes a wrong turn.

16:54.371 --> 16:56.347
And in the past,
when this happened,

16:56.499 --> 16:59.350
we couldn't intervene
to help the babies.

16:59.577 --> 17:01.502
And, too often...

17:02.263 --> 17:03.929
...they would die
before they were born.

17:04.024 --> 17:07.099
-No. No.
-No, it's okay.
Just let me finish.

17:07.176 --> 17:08.860
That was the past.

17:09.011 --> 17:11.845
Things are different now.
Your twins have

17:11.865 --> 17:14.348
something called twin-to-twin
transfusion syndrome.

17:14.442 --> 17:16.868
AUSTIN:
It only affects identical twins,

17:17.019 --> 17:19.686
because they...
they share the same placenta.

17:19.781 --> 17:21.873
LEELA:
You see, what's happening

17:22.024 --> 17:23.766
is there are
abnormal connections

17:23.785 --> 17:24.876
between the blood vessels

17:25.103 --> 17:26.936
going from one twin
to the other.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.954
So, blood is not flowing
evenly between them.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.548
IAN:
One twin-- the larger one--

17:30.775 --> 17:33.276
is getting too much blood, which
will cause his heart to fail.

17:33.294 --> 17:35.945
The heart of the other twin
is not getting enough blood,

17:36.114 --> 17:37.630
which is why he's so small.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.282
We have to use lasers

17:39.284 --> 17:42.543
to cut the blood vessels
linking the babies.

17:42.637 --> 17:44.711
Like this.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.140
See? So they can each have
their own blood supply.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.976
AUSTIN:
And so the pregnancy
can continue.

17:51.129 --> 17:52.904
And if all goes well,

17:53.131 --> 17:55.298
the babies will thrive
to be healthy kids,

17:55.391 --> 17:58.651
and then, ultimately,
healthy adults.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.304
You're making it sound simple,

18:01.397 --> 18:03.322
-but I don't think it is.
-You're right. I have to

18:03.416 --> 18:05.416
tell you that
no matter what we do,

18:05.493 --> 18:10.213
the smaller baby is in grave
danger and may not survive.

18:12.650 --> 18:15.576
I shouldn't have missed my
appointment. This is my fault.

18:15.744 --> 18:18.579
IAN:
There is no way that
this is your fault.

18:18.673 --> 18:22.308
Most likely, no one would have
been able to see this earlier.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.679
Just do whatever you have to do.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.607
Please save my babies.

18:41.195 --> 18:43.204
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

18:44.940 --> 18:46.682
Odds.

18:46.775 --> 18:50.369
There is an 80% chance
that the smaller twin will die.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.113
-And the larger baby?
-Fifty-fifty.

18:53.207 --> 18:54.448
If we don't do the procedure,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.709
it's certain
that both twins will die.

18:56.861 --> 18:59.695
I didn't want to put too much
on the mom so soon,

18:59.714 --> 19:02.515
but you're doctors,
you should know everything.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.873
You've helped perfect
this procedure, correct?

19:10.892 --> 19:12.299
Yes, I have.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.210
And I've performed it
many times.

19:14.228 --> 19:16.545
We're incredibly lucky
to have you here at Chastain.

19:16.564 --> 19:19.973
But the equipment
I need to do it isn't here.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.976
It requires
very specialized tools.

19:23.070 --> 19:25.312
The closest fetal surgery center

19:25.406 --> 19:27.665
is in Orlando.

19:27.816 --> 19:30.226
We need to transfer Padma
as soon as possible,

19:30.244 --> 19:33.229
and the surgery will have
to be done by a doctor there.

19:33.322 --> 19:34.672
But we want you
to do the surgery.

19:34.899 --> 19:36.565
Well, and I would love to.

19:36.659 --> 19:40.085
I am incredibly frustrated
that I can't, but...

19:40.238 --> 19:42.405
public hospitals very rarely

19:42.498 --> 19:45.741
have the capability
to do fetal surgery.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.501
Let's focus
on what we have to do.

19:47.595 --> 19:50.079
-How quickly must this happen?
-As soon as possible.

19:50.097 --> 19:51.931
The smaller baby could die
within hours, and if that

19:52.083 --> 19:54.692
happens, the other twin
will die too.

19:55.753 --> 19:59.030
Okay, doctors, well then,
let's call Orlando right away.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.533
I'll get Kit
to order a helicopter.

20:12.119 --> 20:15.129
A mass in my brain.

20:17.124 --> 20:20.384
My aunt's husband, uh,
died from glioblastoma.

20:20.611 --> 20:23.128
It was... horrible.

20:24.131 --> 20:27.283
We don't know this is cancer,
much less a GBM.

20:27.301 --> 20:29.635
What else could it be?

20:29.729 --> 20:32.212
CONRAD:
Dr. Sutton has to operate
to find out.

20:32.306 --> 20:34.548
BILLIE:
The surgery is dangerous

20:34.642 --> 20:36.792
with many
possible complications.

20:36.885 --> 20:39.153
-We need to go over them.
-No, I...

20:44.059 --> 20:46.410
I grew up homeless.

20:46.562 --> 20:48.913
I never graduated high school.

20:49.082 --> 20:53.309
I apprenticed in kitchens,
and I learned my trade,

20:53.327 --> 20:57.329
and I won a James Beard Award
at 28.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.298
(short chuckle)

21:00.093 --> 21:02.260
I love my life,

21:02.411 --> 21:04.762
and I will take any risk.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.082
You're a badass.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.753
(pager beeps)

21:12.847 --> 21:15.606
-I've got to go.
-Let's book an OR.

21:15.758 --> 21:18.025
We'll be back.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.450
DEVON:
Hey.

21:30.272 --> 21:32.957
We can't stay long. I don't want
to leave Padma alone.

21:33.184 --> 21:34.292
She's not alone.

21:34.443 --> 21:36.252
I just paged Conrad.
He's gonna monitor her.

21:37.522 --> 21:38.754
Are you okay?

21:41.801 --> 21:44.451
My heart is breaking for her.

21:44.545 --> 21:46.804
I know. Poor AJ.

21:47.031 --> 21:49.048
So soon after he lost
his mother.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.143
This is how life is.

21:52.370 --> 21:53.811
Everything's perfect,

21:53.962 --> 21:56.814
and you think you have it
figured out...

21:56.891 --> 22:00.109
Just yesterday,
we were all celebrating.

22:02.304 --> 22:03.395
The problems
never stop coming,

22:03.489 --> 22:05.472
and we all have to
live with that.

22:05.566 --> 22:08.717
But things are different
for us now.

22:08.736 --> 22:10.661
We have each other.

22:13.057 --> 22:15.649
Yeah.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.127
And we always will.

22:23.234 --> 22:24.917
What's the helicopter's ETA?

22:25.011 --> 22:27.736
Okay, we'll have the patient
waiting.

22:27.830 --> 22:29.905
Half an hour.
Orlando is prepared.

22:29.998 --> 22:31.331
Get Padma ready
for transport.

22:31.425 --> 22:32.850
-I want to go with her.
-Of course.

22:33.077 --> 22:35.077
I-I'll get someone
to cover your surgeries.

22:35.096 --> 22:38.689
-You and Leela must
both be there.
-Thank you.

22:46.515 --> 22:48.657
(phone rings)

22:50.444 --> 22:52.611
Hello, my dear.

22:52.763 --> 22:54.187
So, I have some good news.

22:54.281 --> 22:56.281
They're trying me on a new
anti-CD20 antibody

22:56.434 --> 22:58.191
that's been shown to reduce
relapse rates,

22:58.211 --> 23:00.619
and so far, I'm tolerating it
really well.

23:00.771 --> 23:02.713
Oh, that's wonderful news.

23:02.865 --> 23:05.107
Bless your new doctors,
Randolph,

23:05.200 --> 23:06.867
because I needed some good news.

23:06.961 --> 23:09.278
-What's wrong?
<i> -Everything.</i>

23:09.296 --> 23:11.947
Padma's twins have TTTS.

23:11.966 --> 23:12.965
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

23:13.059 --> 23:15.375
-So is Ian gonna operate?
<i> -He can't.</i>

23:15.469 --> 23:17.043
We have to send them
out of state

23:17.063 --> 23:18.954
because we don't have
the right facilities here.

23:18.973 --> 23:20.639
<i> Well, Chastain</i>
<i> needs more funding</i>

23:20.733 --> 23:23.292
<i> -if it's gonna stay</i>
<i> a first-class hospital.</i>
-Yeah.

23:23.310 --> 23:24.810
And if this idiot
becomes our new governor,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.237
we'll have less than
we ever had.

23:26.388 --> 23:27.463
<i> He's polling ahead.</i>

23:27.481 --> 23:29.740
It's just so hard
being away from you.

23:29.892 --> 23:31.409
I wish I was there to help.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.228
<i> No. You're exactly</i>
<i> where you need to be.</i>

23:35.248 --> 23:37.640
<i> You don't have to worry</i>
<i> about me or Chastain.</i>

23:37.733 --> 23:41.143
<i> Just concentrate on</i>
<i> finishing the treatment.</i>

23:41.162 --> 23:44.237
It's just, a few more months
just seems like forever.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.482
<i> Hmm. But it'll be worth it.</i>

23:46.575 --> 23:49.409
When you come back home
you'll be healthy and strong

23:49.429 --> 23:50.410
for our wedding.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.321
<i> I can't wait.</i>

23:52.339 --> 23:53.681
Love you.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.843
(thunder rumbles)

23:57.995 --> 24:00.012
-(monitor alarm beeping)
-(gasping)

24:00.164 --> 24:02.164
I have to take a quick listen.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.850
It's hard... to breathe.

24:05.002 --> 24:07.336
Try to stay calm.

24:07.354 --> 24:08.279
I'll give you some oxygen,

24:08.430 --> 24:11.173
make you feel better, okay?

24:11.192 --> 24:13.659
(breathing erratically)

24:20.442 --> 24:21.542
Here we go.

24:30.361 --> 24:32.803
Better?

24:33.030 --> 24:35.047
You have fluid
building up in your lungs

24:35.199 --> 24:36.548
and the rest of your body.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.625
Sometimes with TTTS,

24:38.719 --> 24:41.720
the mom starts mirroring
the symptoms of her babies.

24:41.814 --> 24:46.525
That's probably what caused you
too faint in the bar.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.135
Helicopter's here.

24:49.230 --> 24:50.804
That's a good thing.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.073
She's mirroring.

24:57.479 --> 24:59.580
(thunder rumbles)

25:02.150 --> 25:04.484
I'm sorry. They barely managed
to land safely.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.487
-Now they're grounded.
They can't take off in this.
-What?

25:07.507 --> 25:09.673
It's okay.
It's just a small delay.

25:09.900 --> 25:12.551
All right, we have to
take her back.

25:15.998 --> 25:18.741
Padma can't afford
to wait any longer.

25:18.759 --> 25:21.334
She's showing signs
of maternal mirror syndrome.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.579
Mom's life is now at risk, too?

25:23.597 --> 25:25.856
Surgery's the only way
to save Padma and the babies.

25:26.008 --> 25:27.173
We're out of time.

25:27.268 --> 25:29.568
We have to find a way
to do the surgery here.

25:38.095 --> 25:39.853
-Devon.
-Hey. We're headed into the ICU.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.113
Okay, good.
I'll page Cade.

25:41.265 --> 25:42.998
Have her meet us there.

25:43.859 --> 25:46.118
Kit. How can I help?

25:46.270 --> 25:48.379
Is there any way
to do the surgery

25:48.530 --> 25:50.881
-with what we have
at Chastain?
-No.

25:51.033 --> 25:52.550
But when I saw the weather
coming in,

25:52.701 --> 25:54.200
I-I made a few calls.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.612
Lundsford College of Medicine
is teaching surgical residents

25:56.630 --> 25:58.556
how to operate on fetuses
in their sim lab.

25:58.632 --> 26:00.874
They may have
the equipment we need.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.801
Bell's been teaching
at Lundsford.

26:02.953 --> 26:05.729
I'll get him involved
immediately.

26:20.228 --> 26:21.579
<i> BELL:</i>
<i> What's going on?</i>

26:21.730 --> 26:24.139
A lot. Can you get the
Lundsford College of Medicine

26:24.141 --> 26:26.625
to do us a favor?

26:27.420 --> 26:29.069
(Padma panting)

26:29.088 --> 26:30.996
Blood pressure's spiking.

26:31.148 --> 26:34.240
-O2 sats are dropping.
-PADMA: I'm scared.

26:34.335 --> 26:35.759
The alarms...

26:35.911 --> 26:39.338
CONRAD:
It's just telling us
your oxygen levels are low.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.639
(alarms stop)

26:44.920 --> 26:46.662
DEVON:
Hey, let's give 'em
some space to work.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.754
We'll watch from outside.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.998
If she needs you,
you're right here.

26:50.167 --> 26:52.109
-I'll be right outside, okay?
-Okay.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.612
The diuretic and blood pressure
meds will keep you stable

26:54.763 --> 26:55.946
until we do the procedure.

26:56.098 --> 26:59.432
Are these medications
safe for the baby?

26:59.526 --> 27:00.784
CADE:
Absolutely.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.511
In fact,
ten out of ten babies

27:02.680 --> 27:05.364
prefer blood pressure
to be lower than 140.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.292
It makes for more excellent
swimming conditions.

27:08.477 --> 27:09.960
AUSTIN:
Hey.

27:10.112 --> 27:11.520
Good news.

27:11.538 --> 27:13.205
Bell pulled some strings
at Lundstrom.

27:13.357 --> 27:15.466
They're gonna send over
the fetoscope

27:15.693 --> 27:17.876
and some minimally invasive
fetal surgery tools

27:18.028 --> 27:19.027
via police escort.

27:19.121 --> 27:20.662
So Ian will be able
to do the surgery.

27:20.714 --> 27:23.456
Okay, good. I'll go let
the OR circulating nurse know,

27:23.476 --> 27:25.033
make sure everyone's
on deck and ready.

27:25.052 --> 27:26.385
All right.

27:27.462 --> 27:29.705
-Hey, how's it going in here?
-Mm-hmm.

27:29.798 --> 27:31.148
How's her pedal edema?

27:31.299 --> 27:33.651
How much proteinuria
is on her dip?

27:38.324 --> 27:41.233
You're not the doctor or surgeon
now, you're the father.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.661
Here to support the mom.

27:43.812 --> 27:46.980
Okay, well, in that capacity
is my next question.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.333
Should we wait for
the weather to clear

27:49.502 --> 27:51.076
instead of trying
to jury-rig this thing?

27:51.228 --> 27:53.379
-No.
-There's no one else
in this time zone

27:53.564 --> 27:56.715
more qualified to make
this call. Look.

27:57.918 --> 28:00.919
He's done the science,
had the outcomes.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.097
You're in the best hands.

28:08.336 --> 28:09.520
Thank you all
for your high energy

28:09.671 --> 28:10.670
in the middle of the night.

28:10.690 --> 28:11.671
JESSICA:
Well, we're honored

28:11.691 --> 28:12.523
to be a part of Chastain's

28:12.750 --> 28:14.416
first fetal procedure.

28:14.435 --> 28:17.010
The fetoscope has arrived.

28:17.104 --> 28:18.845
DEVON:
Dr. Sullivan,
are you confident

28:18.864 --> 28:22.199
you can make the GI tower
compatible with the fetoscope?

28:22.426 --> 28:24.184
IAN:
Doing surgery in small spaces

28:24.203 --> 28:27.187
has made me a bit
of an AV whiz.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.264
The light post is smaller,
but that just means

28:29.357 --> 28:30.615
we'll white balance
ahead of time.

28:30.768 --> 28:32.951
And we'll-we'll pressure limit
the suction port

28:33.028 --> 28:35.437
to account for the smaller
luminal diameter.

28:35.456 --> 28:37.439
JAYCI:
The cavalry has arrived,

28:37.532 --> 28:39.608
though I can already sense
there are way too many

28:39.626 --> 28:41.626
advanced degrees in my OR.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.870
JESSICA:
And it looks like
we have more company.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.130
JAYCI:
Dr. Voss said the surgical
residents learning about

28:45.224 --> 28:47.632
fetal surgery at Lundsford
are going to watch

28:47.709 --> 28:51.211
the famous Dr. Sullivan
do his magic tricks.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.306
DEVON:
Ian, have you met our
night anesthesiologist?

28:54.458 --> 28:56.625
-Dr. Lee.
-Nice to meet you, Dr. Lee.

28:56.718 --> 28:59.644
JAYCI:
Three lives in our hands
tonight. Pressure's on.

28:59.813 --> 29:02.531
IAN:
I'll go scrub in.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.097
(door opens)

29:36.016 --> 29:38.150
♪ ♪

29:58.464 --> 29:59.855
Hi, sweetheart.

29:59.873 --> 30:01.465
Hey, they're ready for you
in the OR.

30:01.616 --> 30:04.359
Just getting my good glasses.
You gonna watch?

30:04.378 --> 30:07.513
-Oh, yes.
-Great. After you.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.802
Can you see the mass yet?

30:22.822 --> 30:24.546
BILLIE:
Almost there.

30:24.565 --> 30:27.599
The tissue surrounding it
appears enflamed.

30:27.734 --> 30:29.618
Dissecting down carefully.

30:30.830 --> 30:33.664
Does it seem like a malignancy?

30:33.815 --> 30:35.541
BILLIE:
Too soon to tell.

30:36.894 --> 30:38.961
All right, hold on,
I feel it.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.090
That's odd, it's...

30:44.492 --> 30:46.218
It's encapsulated.

30:49.664 --> 30:50.922
So, no glioblastoma.

30:51.091 --> 30:53.758
Could it be a teratoma?

30:53.927 --> 30:56.186
BILLIE:
No. I think...

30:59.692 --> 31:01.933
...it's an egg.

31:02.086 --> 31:03.602
(exhales sharply)

31:03.754 --> 31:05.070
That's not a tumor.

31:07.424 --> 31:09.658
Nope.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.262
A parasite.

31:14.431 --> 31:17.023
Which means our patient
is gonna be fine.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.268
That is such great news.

31:20.362 --> 31:21.879
I'm gonna go check on Padma.

31:22.030 --> 31:23.714
Okay, I'll join you
when I'm done here.

31:30.556 --> 31:34.040
They haven't started yet.
Ian just got here.

31:34.134 --> 31:35.375
FELLOW 1:
I heard he saved triplets once.

31:35.469 --> 31:36.635
FELLOW 2:
No one thought using a laser

31:36.787 --> 31:38.453
inside the uterus would work.

31:38.455 --> 31:41.973
He's a miracle worker.
Touched by the hands of God.

31:42.126 --> 31:45.027
<i> IAN:</i>
<i> All right, Padma.</i>

31:48.390 --> 31:50.240
Why don't you take
your sister's hand.

31:52.727 --> 31:56.471
And why don't you hold my arm
with your other hand.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.823
All right?

31:58.918 --> 32:00.642
If at any point
you feel any pain,

32:00.735 --> 32:03.069
you stop me.
Okay?

32:03.163 --> 32:05.797
Why don't we start
with some lidocaine.

32:14.324 --> 32:15.674
Okay.

32:15.768 --> 32:18.009
You're gonna feel
some pressure now.

32:18.162 --> 32:21.163
This is the tube through which

32:21.181 --> 32:25.025
I will insert the fetoscope.

32:29.764 --> 32:31.173
-(alarm beeping)
-(Padma gasps)

32:31.266 --> 32:33.008
JAYCI:
Problem. Mom's BP
is spiking again.

32:33.010 --> 32:36.161
I'm nearly maxed out
on nicardipine.

32:39.107 --> 32:40.290
What's happening?

32:40.442 --> 32:42.884
Her mirror syndrome
is getting worse.

32:42.886 --> 32:43.961
DEVON:
Do we need to stop?

32:44.112 --> 32:45.187
LEELA:
Yes. Take her back to the ICU.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.521
Her heart could fail.

32:46.523 --> 32:48.114
-IAN: We'll lose the twins.
-PADMA: No!

32:48.133 --> 32:49.874
AUSTIN:
When the problem is the heart,

32:50.027 --> 32:51.359
you page Dr. Austin.

32:51.378 --> 32:52.544
Let's get IV furosemide hanging.

32:52.638 --> 32:56.031
And I need an ultrasound wand.

32:56.049 --> 32:57.724
(Padma wheezing)

33:01.038 --> 33:03.814
AJ, please.

33:04.041 --> 33:07.150
Don't want to die.

33:07.302 --> 33:09.544
Don't want babies...

33:09.563 --> 33:10.879
Padma, look at me.

33:10.972 --> 33:12.823
No one is dying today,
you hear me?

33:12.974 --> 33:15.742
We're keeping
all three of you alive.

33:17.888 --> 33:19.054
He's just managing
your pressures

33:19.072 --> 33:21.890
so we can continue
with the procedure, okay?

33:21.908 --> 33:25.168
Right, and you should start
to feel better in a moment.

33:29.157 --> 33:31.657
No, no, it's not working.
Her heart could still fail.

33:31.677 --> 33:32.751
AUSTIN:
Another minute, Devi.

33:32.903 --> 33:34.511
I will not risk Padma's life,

33:34.738 --> 33:36.430
I promise you that.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.100
We-we can't wait.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.846
Blood pressure's coming
back down to normal range.

33:53.866 --> 33:56.033
Of course it is.

33:58.612 --> 33:59.944
I can breathe.

34:00.097 --> 34:01.596
Of course you can.

34:01.598 --> 34:03.206
IAN:
You watch that heart
like a hawk.

34:03.433 --> 34:05.433
I'm gonna keep her stable,
you just do

34:05.527 --> 34:08.170
what you need to do,
all right?

34:09.864 --> 34:12.274
IAN:
You're doing great, Padma.

34:12.292 --> 34:14.276
Now, we're going to insert

34:14.294 --> 34:18.430
the fetoscope, okay?

34:19.466 --> 34:21.541
This will give us
the best look

34:21.560 --> 34:23.042
we have of your babies.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.095
Take a look at that monitor
to your left.

34:25.247 --> 34:27.689
(monitor beeping)

34:34.648 --> 34:37.482
140. Strong.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.493
That's the larger twin.

34:50.814 --> 34:52.756
You're losing him, Sullivan.

34:57.805 --> 35:00.338
IAN:
I'm now inserting the laser

35:00.432 --> 35:04.267
to burn the connecting
blood vessels.

35:14.095 --> 35:17.505
JESSICA:
The uterus is filling
with blood.

35:17.524 --> 35:20.099
Bleeding upon entry with
the transplacental approach

35:20.119 --> 35:21.676
can happen.

35:22.346 --> 35:24.454
CONRAD:
This is a known risk
of the surgery.

35:24.606 --> 35:26.681
BILLIE:
All that blood will make it
difficult to see.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.199
She's bleeding out.

35:28.352 --> 35:31.294
IAN:
Heart rate's at 62.
Can I have one liter

35:31.446 --> 35:32.796
of Lactated Ringer's, please?

35:32.965 --> 35:35.632
DEVON:
And infuse the uterus
with fluid,

35:35.783 --> 35:38.193
and clear the field.

35:38.211 --> 35:40.286
BILLIE:
This is awful.

35:40.305 --> 35:44.141
Mother and twins are crashing.

35:44.368 --> 35:46.050
Come on.

35:46.145 --> 35:49.062
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.030
IAN:
All clear.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.807
Now ablating

36:01.827 --> 36:04.202
the remaining blood vessels.

36:08.816 --> 36:11.576
JESSICA:
Incredible.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.912
CONRAD:
He barely blinked.

36:14.064 --> 36:15.488
How did he do that?

36:15.507 --> 36:17.674
I don't know.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.428
AUSTIN:
And the smaller one's heart rate

36:30.522 --> 36:32.263
is climbing to 103.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.582
(laughs)

36:34.601 --> 36:36.359
(Jessica whoops)

36:36.586 --> 36:38.770
(applause)

36:38.846 --> 36:41.531
Ah...

36:41.758 --> 36:45.535
Yes! Yes! Yes!

36:49.616 --> 36:51.208
You did great.

37:02.779 --> 37:04.462
-Ian.
-Hey.

37:04.614 --> 37:05.780
I want to thank you.

37:05.873 --> 37:07.373
-You were masterful yesterday.
-Oh...

37:07.392 --> 37:09.875
Well, you have been
every day since I've hired you.

37:09.970 --> 37:11.453
You're too kind.

37:11.546 --> 37:12.804
No, it's the truth.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.789
You're a terrific addition
to the hospital.

37:14.808 --> 37:17.459
Well, Bell played a huge role,
even in absentia.

37:17.552 --> 37:19.811
Hard to believe
in the middle of his treatment

37:19.887 --> 37:22.130
in Minnesota, he was able
to score that equipment

37:22.299 --> 37:23.631
we needed from Lundsford.

37:23.725 --> 37:25.483
Yeah, I wanted to
discuss that with you.

37:25.635 --> 37:28.152
It's killing me that
we don't have what you need

37:28.305 --> 37:29.412
here at Chastain.

37:29.564 --> 37:31.639
Everything goes back
to Lundsford today,

37:31.658 --> 37:32.916
and we're right back
where we started.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.252
Well, maybe I could help
raise some money

37:35.403 --> 37:38.070
so we could
build an intrauterine

37:38.090 --> 37:39.589
surgical center of our own.

37:39.816 --> 37:41.073
That would be amazing.

37:41.093 --> 37:44.152
I have a pretty fair
track record at raising funds.

37:44.154 --> 37:48.673
-Grateful parents often become
faithful donors.
-Dr. Sullivan,

37:48.825 --> 37:50.100
you're needed in OR Three.

37:50.251 --> 37:53.328
-We'll talk later.
-Appendectomy on a teenager.

37:53.421 --> 37:54.604
There's no one else on call?

37:54.681 --> 37:56.940
I just finished that four-hour
biliary atresia.

37:57.167 --> 37:58.683
I'm sorry, they tried,
but it's an emergency.

37:58.835 --> 38:01.194
-Be right there.
-Thank you.

38:12.516 --> 38:14.499
(pills rattling)

38:28.956 --> 38:30.365
You see that?

38:30.458 --> 38:31.866
Steady as a rock.
(chuckles)

38:31.959 --> 38:35.478
And Biden is president.
And he won.

38:35.705 --> 38:38.964
The best news
is you don't have cancer.

38:39.059 --> 38:41.300
-I had a cute little worm.
-CONRAD: Which you got

38:41.320 --> 38:42.986
from eating undercooked pork.

38:43.213 --> 38:45.155
I can't believe I did that.

38:45.382 --> 38:47.549
My kitchen test experiments
with undercooked sausage

38:47.567 --> 38:49.717
will not be repeated.
(chuckles)

38:49.811 --> 38:51.644
CONRAD:
Well, at least now

38:51.663 --> 38:54.039
you have an unusual pet.

38:55.483 --> 38:57.225
I thought about naming him,
but I think

38:57.243 --> 39:00.086
I'm just gonna
flush him down the toilet.

39:04.067 --> 39:05.342
How's Gigi?

39:05.569 --> 39:07.510
She had another nightmare
last night.

39:07.662 --> 39:09.328
I'm so sorry.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.739
-Two nights in a row?
-Yep.

39:11.758 --> 39:13.091
I know a good child psychologist

39:13.185 --> 39:14.926
if you want to talk to someone
about how to handle this.

39:15.078 --> 39:17.002
It may come to that,
but I've been

39:17.097 --> 39:18.521
doing some reading.

39:18.748 --> 39:21.841
First, there are a few things
I can try at home.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.418
Hey, you.

39:23.436 --> 39:26.421
Hey. Guess who got off early.

39:26.439 --> 39:27.605
I convinced Irving
to take my shift.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.608
Do you want to get Gigi
and go for some pizza?

39:30.760 --> 39:33.111
-Oh, Billie, you should
come with.
-Yeah.

39:33.263 --> 39:35.780
You're so kind, but, uh,

39:35.874 --> 39:38.282
I have two more surgeries today.

39:38.435 --> 39:39.209
Have fun.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.544
All right.
See you later.

39:41.696 --> 39:44.439
I can't go either. I got to
pick something up for Gigi

39:44.532 --> 39:46.791
and work on this nightmare
situation.

39:46.943 --> 39:48.943
But I want to see you tonight.

39:48.962 --> 39:51.279
She goes to bed at 8:30.
Come by after?

39:51.297 --> 39:54.724
-I'll bring the pizza.
-Mmm.

40:00.790 --> 40:02.214
Okay, so I don't get it.

40:02.234 --> 40:05.050
Why didn't you tell him
how you felt about him?

40:05.145 --> 40:06.403
-Maybe I did.
-No.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.905
'Cause if you did,
he would be with you right now.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.723
I doubt that.

40:11.559 --> 40:12.909
At Kit and Bell's
engagement party,

40:13.136 --> 40:14.636
I had my speech prepared.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.638
Conrad left with Cade
before I could get a word out.

40:16.731 --> 40:20.583
Ah, that's painful.
You missed the moment.

40:20.735 --> 40:22.644
-But there's an upside.
-Yeah?

40:22.662 --> 40:24.587
Conrad and I are closer
than we've ever been.

40:24.814 --> 40:28.133
-Best friends.
-Ouch.

40:30.262 --> 40:31.002
My take.

40:31.154 --> 40:33.154
Conrad chose Cade

40:33.247 --> 40:34.489
thinking you weren't interested

40:34.507 --> 40:36.415
because you were
Nic's best friend.

40:36.509 --> 40:39.418
He figured that was a line
you wouldn't cross.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.253
And you allowed him
to think that

40:41.347 --> 40:43.731
because you never crossed it.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.335
-Now it's too late.
-No.

40:47.428 --> 40:51.281
It's never too late to win
the love of your life back.

40:55.287 --> 40:59.438
It's dark out here, Daddy.

40:59.516 --> 41:00.682
Oh, I know.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.292
I want you to see
something beautiful

41:02.443 --> 41:05.503
that you can only see
in the dark.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.029
What kind of moon is it?

41:15.122 --> 41:18.141
-A crescent moon.
-Mm-hmm.

41:19.719 --> 41:21.869
It's beautiful, isn't it?

41:21.963 --> 41:24.038
Yes, Daddy.

41:24.131 --> 41:26.632
(owl hooting)

41:26.651 --> 41:28.133
(Conrad chuckles)

41:28.153 --> 41:29.877
-You hear that owl?
-Yeah.

41:29.896 --> 41:32.322
Yeah, yeah.
Owls love the dark.

41:32.398 --> 41:34.065
That's when they come out.

41:34.217 --> 41:35.550
Aren't owls beautiful?

41:35.568 --> 41:38.052
I love owls.

41:38.145 --> 41:40.145
Yeah, there are so many
beautiful things in the dark.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.499
-What else is there?
-Stars?

41:42.650 --> 41:44.200
Ah, stars.

41:44.427 --> 41:47.128
Yeah, we love stars, right?
What else?

41:49.082 --> 41:51.899
-(sighs)
-Can we read<i> The Runaway Bunny?</i>

41:51.918 --> 41:53.051
We can.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.012
But I got you a new book.

41:56.163 --> 41:58.740
This one is called...

41:59.667 --> 42:03.745
<i> ...There's a Nightmare</i>
<i> in My Closet.</i>

42:03.838 --> 42:06.581
No, Daddy, that sounds scary.

42:06.674 --> 42:09.025
Well, it's not. It's about
being brave at bedtime.

42:09.176 --> 42:12.654
Turns out the nightmare
isn't scary at all.

42:13.940 --> 42:15.940
What do you say?
You want to hear it?

42:16.034 --> 42:19.244
-Okay.
-Yeah, okay.

42:21.964 --> 42:25.124
Get in tight.
Snuggle up.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.695
Okay, now I want you
to go to sleep

42:29.714 --> 42:31.272
and have good dreams.

42:31.441 --> 42:32.882
I know you've had
some bad ones,

42:33.034 --> 42:35.677
but that's over now.
You know you're safe.

42:36.537 --> 42:38.871
(kisses)

42:38.965 --> 42:40.281
There's nothing
that can hurt you.

42:40.374 --> 42:43.951
I'll go to sleep
if you stay with me.

42:43.970 --> 42:46.563
Okay, I will.
