by
HOME BOX OFFICE

00:05.833 --> 00:09.867
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:14.333 --> 00:15.967
NO, NO,
DON'T EAT COOKIES,

00:16.000 --> 00:17.133
IT'S ALMOST
TIME FOR DINNER.

00:17.167 --> 00:19.233
WHY DON'T
WE GO OUT ?

00:20.200 --> 00:21.533
CHINESE ?

00:21.567 --> 00:22.800
CHINESE,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

00:22.833 --> 00:25.200
WE COULD STOP
AND GET A DRINK FIRST.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.533
WHAT DO YOU MEAN STOP
AND HAVE A DRINK FIRST ?

00:27.567 --> 00:28.967
WE CAN STOP AT, UH...

00:29.000 --> 00:30.400
OOH, YOU KNOW
WHERE I WANT TO GO ?

00:30.433 --> 00:32.333
CASTLE DEL MAR,

00:32.367 --> 00:35.567
THE FANCY RESTAURANT
BY THE WATER.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.700
THEN WE CAN STOP
AND HAVE A LEISURELY DRINK.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.367
ARE YOU KIDDING, YOU CAN HAVE
A DRINK AT THE RESTAURANT

00:39.400 --> 00:40.367
IF YOU WANT
TO HAVE A DRINK.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.533
NO, BUT THIS
WILL BE NICE.4

00:41.567 --> 00:44.567
IT'LL BE JUST
A FEW HOURS OF HANGING OUT,

00:44.600 --> 00:46.433
HAVING A DRINK.

00:46.467 --> 00:49.467
YOU KNOW, FIRST YOU
WANT TO JUST STOP OFF

00:49.500 --> 00:51.633
AND HAVE A DRINK THERE
AND THEN GET BACK IN THE CAR,

00:51.667 --> 00:54.667
AND THEN DRIVE
TO THE RESTAURANT.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.433
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU SHOULD JUST GO

00:56.467 --> 00:58.633
AND GET THE DRINK
AT THE RESTAURANT, NO ?

00:58.667 --> 01:02.533
I WOULD LIKE TO STOP OFF
AND HAVE A DRINK ON THE WAY.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.067
BUT IT'S
THE SAME DRINK,

01:04.067 --> 01:05.467
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
WHERE YOU HAVE THE DRINK ?

01:05.500 --> 01:08.767
IT'S A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE,
YOU KNOW WHAT...

01:08.800 --> 01:10.867
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
IT'S A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE,

01:10.900 --> 01:11.867
WHAT, I THOUGHT...

01:11.900 --> 01:12.900
YEAH.

01:12.933 --> 01:13.933
BUT IT'S THE DRINK,
ISN'T IT ?

01:13.967 --> 01:16.067
THEY HAVE THE DRINK
AT THE RESTAURANT.

01:16.067 --> 01:17.200
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS ?

01:17.233 --> 01:18.633
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.167
BUT DON'T YOU
WANT TO EAT ?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.667
I DO WANT TO EAT,

01:21.700 --> 01:24.267
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SIT THERE
AND HAVE A DRINK AND SOCIALIZE,

01:24.300 --> 01:25.600
AND NOT HAVE FOOD
PASSING BY US.

01:25.633 --> 01:28.067
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD JUST
SIT THERE AND HAVE A DRINK,

01:28.067 --> 01:31.067
AND KNOWING THAT YOU
WANT TO LEAVE TO EAT.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.500
WHEN YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT FOOD,

01:32.533 --> 01:34.800
HOW CAN YOU SIT
AND RELAX AND HAVE A DRINK,
IT JUST DOESN'T...

01:34.833 --> 01:36.767
YOU'RE MISSING
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE DRINK.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.833
THAT'S IT !

01:37.867 --> 01:38.867
WHAT IS THE POINT
OF THE DRINK ?

01:38.900 --> 01:40.400
I AM MISSING
THE POINT OF THE DRINK.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.433
BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE AT A PLACE
WHERE EVERYONE'S SITTING AROUND

01:42.467 --> 01:44.833
HAVING COCKTAILS
AND SOCIALIZING.

01:44.867 --> 01:46.167
WELL, THEN WHY EVEN
GO TO THE RESTAURANT,

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
IF THE RESTAURANT
ISN'T SOCIALIZING,

01:47.233 --> 01:48.233
THEN WHY GO
TO THE RESTAURANT ?

01:48.267 --> 01:49.400
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

01:49.433 --> 01:51.400
FINE, WE'LL JUST GET
TAKE OUT FOOD, GREAT.

01:51.433 --> 01:52.900
THAT'S FINE.

01:52.933 --> 01:53.900
GOOD.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.500

02:11.100 --> 02:14.933

ROLLIN' ROLLIN'... *

02:14.967 --> 02:17.167
HEY, JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS CALLED.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.833
OH, OKAY

02:18.867 --> 02:20.767

THE IDEA YET ?

02:20.800 --> 02:23.500
NO, I'M GONNA PITCH IT
TO HER TOMORROW.

02:23.533 --> 02:24.633
OH, SHE'S GONNA
LOVE IT, I BET.

02:24.667 --> 02:25.800
YEAH ?

02:25.833 --> 02:26.800
YEAH, DON'T YOU THINK ?

02:26.833 --> 02:27.800
AH, WE'LL SEE.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.800
OH, MY ELBOW
IS KILLING ME.

02:29.833 --> 02:32.100
THIS TENNIS ELBOW.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.133
OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO,

02:33.167 --> 02:34.600
YOU SHOULD
CALL JOE JOE.

02:34.633 --> 02:37.800
DIDN'T YOU SAY HE LEAVES
MARKS ON YOU SOMETIMES ?

02:37.833 --> 02:39.333
HE DOES, HE LEAVES
SOME BLACK AND BLUE MARKS,

02:39.367 --> 02:40.400
BUT HE'LL FIX IT.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.067
WHAT IS THIS,
IS THIS GARLIC NOODLES ?

02:43.100 --> 02:44.900
THAT DOES NOT LOOK
LIKE KUNG PAO SHRIMP.

02:44.933 --> 02:46.333
THIS ISN'T OUR FOOD.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.067
MM HMM.

02:49.067 --> 02:51.067
DID YOU CHECK THE ORDER
BEFORE YOU LEFT ?

02:51.100 --> 02:55.633
YEAH, I DID, BUT I DECIDED
TO TAKE THE WRONG FOOD HOME.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.267
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU FOR INQUIRING.

02:57.300 --> 03:01.933
WELL, I GUESS YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO RUN BACK THERE,

03:01.967 --> 03:04.500
AND GET
THE RIGHT ORDER.

03:04.533 --> 03:06.267
WHAT A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.067
IF YOU COULD HURRY,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT 'CAUSE...

03:08.067 --> 03:09.433
I'LL TRY.

03:09.467 --> 03:11.267
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.367
IDIOTS.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.533

03:22.567 --> 03:24.767

03:24.800 --> 03:27.167
OH, I'M SO SORRY,

03:27.200 --> 03:28.433

03:49.300 --> 03:50.667
WE GOT OUR
ORDERS MIXED UP.

03:50.700 --> 03:51.700
OH, GOD.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.633
YOU ALMOST HAD
MY KUNG PAO SHRIMP.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.967
HOW ARE YOU ?

03:55.067 --> 03:56.067

04:05.700 --> 04:07.267

04:07.300 --> 04:09.900

GET OUT OF HERE.

04:09.933 --> 04:10.967

04:20.067 --> 04:21.967
I'M BACK.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.200
OH, GOOD.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.667
OH, GOOD.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.300
WELL, THAT WAS
REALLY PLEASANT.

04:28.333 --> 04:31.100
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
IT'LL BE WORTH IT.

04:31.133 --> 04:34.133
YOU KNOW WHO I RAN INTO,
ALAN WASSERMANN.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.367
THAT'S WHO
HAD OUR FOOD,

04:35.400 --> 04:36.633
ALAN WASSERMANN.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.300
WAIT, AM I,
DO I KNOW HIM ?

04:39.333 --> 04:42.167
THE GUY FROM "HBO",
THE PRESIDENT OF "HBO".

04:42.200 --> 04:44.467
OH, OOOH.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.067
YEAH, REMEMBER TWO YEARS AGO
I GOT OUT OF THAT SPECIAL.

04:48.067 --> 04:51.467
I TOLD HIM MY STEPFATHER
GOT IN AN ACCIDENT.

04:51.500 --> 04:57.067
YEAH, WHY DID YOU MAKE UP
A LIE ABOUT A STEPFATHER ?

04:57.067 --> 04:58.333
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A STEPFATHER.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.200
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS A BETTER LIE.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.367
'CAUSE YOU MAKE UP A LIE
ABOUT A STEPFATHER,

05:02.400 --> 05:04.133
YOU'LL BE BELIEVED,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

05:04.167 --> 05:07.833
THAT MUST'VE
BEEN AWKWARD.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.400
YEAH, IT WAS
PRETTY AWKWARD,

05:09.433 --> 05:11.367
BUT HE DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING,
AND NEITHER DID I,

05:11.400 --> 05:12.800
SO, I DON'T KNOW.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.767
WANT SOME NOODLES ?

05:14.800 --> 05:17.133
GET SOME OF THIS
KUNG PAO SHRIMP.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.433
WHERE'S ALL
THE SHRIMP, HERE ?

05:22.467 --> 05:23.733
HMM ?

05:23.767 --> 05:27.900
WHERE'S ALL THE SHRIMP ?
THERE'S ONLY THREE SHRIMP.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.567
IN THAT GIANT CONTAINER
THERE'S...

05:29.600 --> 05:30.700
YEAH, THREE SHRIMP.

05:30.733 --> 05:33.067
THERE'S USUALLY
MORE THAN THAT.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.300
THERE'S, LIKE, 10.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.700
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE 'EM.

05:36.733 --> 05:40.300
DID HE TAKE
THE SHRIMP ?

05:41.367 --> 05:43.800
I'LL BET YOU
HE TOOK THE SHRIMP.

05:43.833 --> 05:45.067
WASSERMANN ?

05:45.067 --> 05:46.567
YEAH.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.133
HE WAS PROBABLY HUNGRY,
HE GOT THE CONTAINER.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.067
HE KNEW, HE SAW
IT WASN'T HIS FOOD.

05:51.067 --> 05:54.200
AND HE ATE SHRIMP,
AND THEN BROUGHT IT BACK.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.467
WOULD HE REALLY DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, THOUGH ?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.933
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WOULD HE REALLY...

05:57.967 --> 06:01.067
THERE'S THREE SHRIMP
IN THERE.

06:01.067 --> 06:03.967
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE EATING
AFTER SOMEBODY ELSE.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.800
WELL, I MEAN, IT'S JUST
THE WHOLE NOTION OF,

06:06.833 --> 06:08.533
THE GUY GETS
THE WRONG ORDER OF FOOD,

06:08.567 --> 06:10.800
AND TAKES FOOD
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO HIM.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.500
AND THEN RETURNS IT ?

06:12.533 --> 06:15.433
WHAT, THINKING
WE'RE NOT GONNA NOTICE THIS ?

06:17.700 --> 06:19.433
THE GUY TOOK
OUR SHRIMP.

06:19.467 --> 06:22.667
GOOD, NICE MOVE.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.600
HI, LAR.

06:26.633 --> 06:27.967
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

06:28.067 --> 06:29.067
YEAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.833
DID IT TAKE YOU
A LONG TIME TO GET HERE ?

06:30.867 --> 06:33.133
WELL, MAYBE ABOUT
25 MINUTES, HALF HOUR.

06:33.167 --> 06:34.367
OH MY GOD,
THAT TRAFFIC.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.367
YEAH...

06:35.400 --> 06:36.533
NEXT TIME I'LL
COME TO YOUR OFFICE.

06:36.567 --> 06:37.600
NO, WHAT ARE
YOU KIDDING ?

06:37.633 --> 06:38.900
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

06:38.933 --> 06:40.133
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME,
I'LL COME HERE NEXT TIME.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.567
I'M HAPPY TO COME
TO YOUR OFFICE.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.900
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME TO ME,
I'M VERY HAPPY TO COME HERE.

06:43.933 --> 06:45.367
NO, WE CAN GO
BACK AND FORTH.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.067
WE DON'T NEED BACK AND FORTH,
WE'LL JUST DO FORTH,

06:47.067 --> 06:48.200
WE DON'T NEED BACK.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.233
YOU'VE TURNED INTO
A VERY NICE MAN ALL OF A SUDDEN.

06:50.267 --> 06:53.533
I'M A LOVELY GENTLEMAN.

06:53.567 --> 06:55.533
SO, WHAT'S THIS IDEA,
I'M DYING TO HEAR IT.

06:55.567 --> 06:56.733
ALRIGHT,
HERE'S THE IDEA.

06:56.767 --> 06:57.733
YEAH.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.733
THAT YOU PLAY
AN ACTRESS.

06:59.767 --> 07:05.200
WHO WAS ON A BIG T.V. SHOW,
A BIG HIT SHOW, LIKE A SEINFELD.

07:05.233 --> 07:07.067
AND WHEN THE SHOW ENDS,

07:07.067 --> 07:11.100
THE ACTRESS HAS
TROUBLE GETTING WORK.

07:11.133 --> 07:15.133
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IDENTIFIES HER
WITH THIS CHARACTER,

07:15.167 --> 07:16.167
WHO SHE PLAYED
ON THE SHOW.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.300
RIGHT.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.767
LET'S SAY SHE PLAYED,
UM, EVELYN, OKAY.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.900
OKAY.

07:20.933 --> 07:23.733
AND SHE GROWS TO HATE
THE CHARACTER, EVELYN.

07:23.767 --> 07:26.367
AND SHE BECOMES
EMBITTERED AND HOSTILE,

07:26.400 --> 07:29.100
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE
YELLING OUT EVELYN ALL THE TIME,

07:29.133 --> 07:31.267
AND EVERYBODY WANTS
HER TO DO EVELYN.

07:31.300 --> 07:34.933
AND SHE CAN'T GET WORK
BECAUSE OF EVELYN.

07:34.967 --> 07:35.967
AND THAT'S THE SHOW ?

07:36.067 --> 07:37.167
THAT'S THE SHOW.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.733
THAT'S A PRETTY
INTERESTING IDEA.

07:39.767 --> 07:40.933
YOU THINK SO ?

07:40.967 --> 07:43.133
YEAH, THE THING THAT
I LOVE ABOUT IT IS THAT,

07:43.167 --> 07:44.600
YOU KNOW,
THIS DOES HAPPEN TO ME.

07:44.633 --> 07:46.433
AND IT HAPPENS TO YOU,
YOU'RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.767
"ELAINE, ELAINE,
ARE YOU ELAINE ?"

07:48.800 --> 07:50.267
I MEAN, THAT HAPPENED TO ME
LAST WEEK, I WAS SKIING.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.633
HEY EVELYN, EVELYN,
IT'LL BE ON THE SERIES, EVELYN.

07:53.667 --> 07:54.733
"HEY EVELYN".

07:54.767 --> 07:56.400
HEY, THAT'S A GOOD NAME
FOR THE SERIES.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.267
HOW ABOUT THIS,
"AREN'T YOU EVELYN ?"

07:58.300 --> 07:59.300
"AREN'T YOU EVELYN ?"

07:59.333 --> 08:01.833
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.933
I MEAN, I THINK
IT'S A REALLY FUNNY IDEA.

08:03.967 --> 08:07.367
BUT I WONDER IF IT'S
BETTER SUITED FOR SOMEBODY...

08:07.400 --> 08:08.833
LIKE JASON.

08:08.867 --> 08:12.733
JASON, I DON'T...

08:12.767 --> 08:13.867
THIS ISN'T
JASON AT ALL.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.300
I THINK HE'S COMPLETELY
WRONG FOR IT.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.433
WELL, I MEAN,
BUT HE PLAYED SUCH A...

08:19.467 --> 08:22.567
I DON'T KNOW,
AN IDIOT ON THE SHOW.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.900
MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER SUITED
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE JASON.

08:26.933 --> 08:29.967
I COULD SEE YOU BEING
MORE FRUSTRATED THAN JASON,

08:30.067 --> 08:32.067
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MANY
DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN DO.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.500
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

08:33.533 --> 08:35.967
REALLY, THIS IS ALL HE CAN DO,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

08:36.067 --> 08:36.967
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'M MORE...

08:37.067 --> 08:38.067
YEAH, YOU'RE
MORE VERSATILE.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.067
VERSATILE.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.067
RIGHT, THAT'S WHY
I SEE IT FOR YOU.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.700
YEAH, ALRIGHT,
I LIKE THIS IDEA A LOT.

08:42.733 --> 08:43.733
YOU DO ?

08:43.767 --> 08:44.767
YEAH, I LIKE IT.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.933
OH, GOOD,
I'M SO RELIEVED.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.067
SO LET'S PITCH IT,
LET'S PITCH IT TO "HBO".

08:48.067 --> 08:50.067
AT "HBO" ?

08:50.067 --> 08:52.833
WELL, I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO SAY "FUCK", YOU KNOW.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.667
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT SAYING FUCK ?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.067
COCKSUCKER.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.200
YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY THOSE,
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THAT.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.233
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T REALLY
GOTTEN TO SAY THAT A LOT.

09:00.267 --> 09:01.300
I HAVEN'T.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.667
I WOULD LIKE TO
BE ABLE TO SAY THAT,

09:02.700 --> 09:03.800
FUCK.

09:03.833 --> 09:08.067
BESIDES, I HAVE A LITTLE
PROBLEM WITH THAT, UH...

09:08.067 --> 09:10.100
THE GUY WHO RUNS IT UP THERE,
ALAN WASSERMANN.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.233
OH, THE PRESIDENT ?

09:11.267 --> 09:12.233
YEAH.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.533
WHAT PROBLEM ?

09:13.567 --> 09:15.400
I THINK HE'S A BAD GUY,
I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO WHY.

09:15.433 --> 09:16.933
I JUST DON'T THINK
HE'S A GOOD GUY AT ALL.

09:16.967 --> 09:18.833
BUT, I MEAN, WHAT IF
WE DIDN'T DEAL WITH HIM ?

09:18.867 --> 09:20.333
LET ME TELL YOU WHY
I'M BRINGING THIS UP.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.200
I'VE GOT A FRIEND,
A PRETTY GOOD FRIEND,

09:22.233 --> 09:24.300
MICHAEL HALBREICH,
WHO WORKS THERE,

09:24.333 --> 09:25.467
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW HIM.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.233
GAY GUY ?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.133
GAY, NO, HE'S NOT GAY,
HE'S MARRIED.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.733
MICHAEL HALBREICH ?

09:30.767 --> 09:31.767
YEAH.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.767
REALLY ?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.733
YEAH, HE'S MARRIED.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.133
OH, I COULD HAVE SWORN
HE WAS GAY, THAT GUY.

09:36.167 --> 09:37.933
OH, NO,
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS.

09:37.967 --> 09:40.267
IN FACT, I'M IN A POKER GAME
WITH MICHAEL AND HIS WIFE...

09:40.300 --> 09:42.567
BOY, THAT'S GREAT,
I WISH I WAS IN A POKER GAME.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.167
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I WAS GONNA SAY,
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.400
BECAUSE ONE OF THE COUPLES
WHO'S IN THE GAME,

09:45.433 --> 09:46.433
THEY'RE GOING TO
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS,

09:46.467 --> 09:47.767
THEY'RE NOT
GONNA BE AROUND,

09:47.800 --> 09:50.067
AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU
AND CHERYL WOULD LIKE TO PLAY,

09:50.067 --> 09:52.367
'CAUSE WE ACTUALLY
NEED ANOTHER COUPLE.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.600
I'LL ASK CHERYL.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.333
I'LL PLAY EVEN IF
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.900
OKAY, YEAH, ASK HER,

09:57.933 --> 09:58.967
AND THEN YOU COULD
ALSO GET TO KNOW HIM.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.000
HE'S A NICE GUY.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.167
OKAY.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.633
I'D JUST LIKE
TO PUT "HBO" IN THE MIX,

10:02.667 --> 10:03.700
I'D REALLY LIKE TO.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.033
ALRIGHT, "HBO".

10:06.067 --> 10:08.067
ALRIGHT, EXCITING.

10:10.733 --> 10:14.367
OW, OH, OW.

10:14.400 --> 10:19.433
OW, OW, AH,

AH, SHUT...

10:25.300 --> 10:27.000

10:27.033 --> 10:28.500
SHE HAS A VERY
HIGH TOLERANCE FOR PAIN,

10:28.533 --> 10:30.167
THIS WOMAN,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.500
OW, WAIT,
WAIT, THAT'S OW...

10:32.533 --> 10:36.433
JULIE LOUIS-DREYFUS
INVITED US TO PLAY POKER.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.233
SHE'S IN THIS
POKER GAME....

10:38.267 --> 10:39.800
OKAY, DO WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW ?

10:39.833 --> 10:41.400
OW, OW.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.433
WE'RE FINISHED.

10:42.467 --> 10:43.500
THAT'S IT ?

10:43.533 --> 10:45.367
THAT'S IT, JUST GOT
TO WASH MY HANDS.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.733
THANK YOU.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.200
THE MAN'S AN ARTIST.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.833
OH, MY GOD.

10:49.867 --> 10:51.900
WHAT HAPPENED,
HE HURT YOU ?

10:51.933 --> 10:54.133
OH, MY GOD.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.600
WHAT DO YOU GOT ?

10:55.633 --> 10:57.833
OH, THAT'S NOTHING.

10:57.867 --> 11:00.100
THAT'S GONNA BE
A LOT WORSE IN TWO DAYS.

11:00.133 --> 11:01.933
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
THAT YOU'RE TAKING

11:01.967 --> 11:03.433
SO MUCH PLEASURE
IN THIS.

11:03.467 --> 11:05.333
OH.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.400
ANYBODY HAVE
A COUGH DROP ?

11:10.433 --> 11:12.067
WOULD YOU LIKE
A FISHERMAN'S FRIEND ?

11:12.067 --> 11:13.200
YEAH, SURE, GIVE ME
A FISHERMAN'S FRIEND.

11:13.233 --> 11:14.233
ALRIGHT,
HAVE ONE OF THESE.

11:14.267 --> 11:15.367
THANK YOU.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.867
DO YOU WANT ONE JULIA ?

11:16.900 --> 11:17.967
ALRIGHT,
THANK YOU.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.433
MM, VERY GOOD.

11:20.467 --> 11:23.333
BOY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE HERE.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.467
I KNOW, THIS IS AMAZING,
ISN'T IT ?

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
PITCHING
ANOTHER SHOW.

11:25.533 --> 11:26.567
IT'S EXCITING.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.433
THE TWO OF US,
DOING THIS TOGETHER ?

11:28.467 --> 11:30.167
OH, LORD,
I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.167
OH, I LIKE IT A LOT.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.067
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN HER MANAGER ?

11:34.100 --> 11:35.333
UH, THREE...

11:35.367 --> 11:36.900
NO, ALMOST,
ACTUALLY FOUR YEARS.

11:36.933 --> 11:38.367
IS IT FOUR NOW ?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.167
WELL, TIME FLIES
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN, HEY ?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.167
YEAH.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.667
EVEN WHEN
YOU'RE NOT.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.267
OOH.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.767
SO, TELL ME WHAT YOU
THINK OF THIS, OKAY.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.367
WHAT ?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.833
MY WIFE AND I ARE GOING
OUT FOR CHINESE FOOD
THE OTHER NIGHT.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.700
SHE SAID THAT SHE WANTS
TO STOP OFF FOR A DRINK FIRST.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.733
I DON'T GET THIS.

11:54.767 --> 11:59.333
WHY PARK THE CAR,
GO INTO THIS HOTEL,

11:59.367 --> 12:02.200
HAVE THE DRINK,
THEN COME BACK OUT,

12:02.233 --> 12:05.133
GET IN THE CAR AGAIN,
DRIVE TO THE RESTAURANT.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.133
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
A HUGE WASTE OF TIME,

12:07.167 --> 12:08.133
YOU CAN GET A DRINK
AT THE RESTAURANT.

12:08.167 --> 12:09.333
IT'S SORT OF
AN OLD-FASHIONED...

12:09.367 --> 12:10.400
YEAH, IT IS.

12:10.433 --> 12:11.700
ROMANTIC IDEA,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

12:11.733 --> 12:12.767
YEAH, IT'S LOVELY.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.800
WE'RE JUST GOING OUT
TO EAT, THAT'S ALL.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.400
DID YOU GO OUT
FOR THE DRINK ?

12:16.433 --> 12:17.467
NO.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
WAS SHE MAD ?

12:18.533 --> 12:19.600
VERY ANNOYED.

12:19.633 --> 12:21.233
YEAH, WE'RE NOT
ON GOOD TERMS BECAUSE OF IT.

12:21.267 --> 12:23.333
I THINK YOU
WERE TOTALLY RIGHT.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.100
YEAH, SEE.

12:25.133 --> 12:27.300
IT MAKES NO SENSE, UNLESS
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET LAID.

12:27.333 --> 12:30.133
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
SHE WAS TRYING TO DO.

12:30.167 --> 12:33.433
MAYBE CHERYL
WANTED TO GET LAID.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.133
OKAY, I GOT YOUR POINT.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.900
LISTEN, THE TWO OF YOU
WILL TAKE THIS.

12:37.933 --> 12:39.100
YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST,
I'LL INTRODUCE IT,

12:39.133 --> 12:40.400
AND YOU'LL RUN
WITH IT, OKAY ?

12:40.433 --> 12:41.767
YEAH.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.900
THEY'RE READY
FOR YOU GUYS NOW.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.767
OH, THEN
HERE WE GO THEN.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.733
YOU READY ?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.400
HEY.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.067
HEY, THERE THEY ARE.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.233
HI, HOW ARE YOU ?

12:50.267 --> 12:52.433
GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.133
HI, MICHAEL,
HOW ARE YOU ?

12:54.167 --> 12:56.533
OH, EUROPEAN.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.567

12:57.600 --> 12:59.333
OH, HI,

12:59.367 --> 13:01.067
EVERYBODY,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.567
DO YOU KNOW,
MICHAEL HALBREICH ?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.767
YEAH, HI MICHAEL.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.833
LARRY, NICE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.867
VERY CUTE.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.267
I HAVE IT
IN BLUE TOO.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.333
REALLY, I GAVE MELISSA
ONE OF THOSE, IT'S REALLY NICE.

13:08.367 --> 13:09.333
HEY, HONEY.

13:09.367 --> 13:10.333
YOU ALRIGHT ?

13:10.367 --> 13:11.333
HI, LARRY,
IT'S JUDY.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.567
WELL, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU HERE.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.300
BOY, THAT, TOOK ABOUT
45 MINUTES FOR THAT, DIDN'T IT ?

13:14.333 --> 13:15.300
YEAH.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.300
JESUS CHRIST.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.367
SORRY, LARRY.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.367
HEY, YOU GOTTA
MAKE THE NICE.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.367
YEAH.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.367
GOTTA MAKE THE NICE.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.367
YOU'VE GOTTA
MAKE THE NICE.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.400
YEAH.

13:22.433 --> 13:23.400
HOW'S YOUR
STEP FATHER DOING ?

13:23.433 --> 13:24.833
GOOD.

13:24.867 --> 13:26.533
HE'S DOING
BETTER NOW, HUH ?

13:26.567 --> 13:27.800
YEAH.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.833
YEAH, MIRACULOUS RECOVERY
HE HAD, HUH ?

13:29.867 --> 13:31.633
( laughing )

13:31.667 --> 13:34.967
ALRIGHT,
SO, TALK TO ME.

13:35.067 --> 13:38.067
UH, WE GOT A BIG SHOW TO PITCH
FOR YOU, BIG, BIG SHOW.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.067
ALRIGHT.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.433
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
SOMETHING INTERESTING.

13:40.467 --> 13:43.167
I'LL LET THE PRINCIPLES
TAKE CARE OF IT FOR YOU.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.733
ALRIGHT, WELL, LARRY
AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS...

13:46.767 --> 13:49.067
CONCEPT RECENTLY, AND I THINK
IT'S PRETTY EXCITING.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.200
ALRIGHT, YOU START,
AND THEN I'LL, YOU KNOW,

13:51.233 --> 13:53.500
DO A DANCE
AND CHEERLEAD AND STUFF.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.600
( laughing )

13:54.633 --> 13:59.500
HOW WERE THE GARLIC NOODLES,
THE OTHER NIGHT ?

13:59.533 --> 14:02.067
WHAT ?

14:02.100 --> 14:03.233
THE GARLIC NOODLES ?

14:03.267 --> 14:05.667
I DIDN'T TOUCH
YOUR GARLIC NOODLES.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.467
I DIDN'T SAY YOU TOUCHED
MY GARLIC NOODLES.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.067
THEY WERE YOUR
GARLIC NOODLES.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.300
RIGHT.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.300
BUT YOU DID
TOUCH THE SHRIMP.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.067
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

14:15.100 --> 14:16.067
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

14:16.100 --> 14:17.067
RIGHT AL.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.233
I ORDERED CHINESE FOOD
THE OTHER NIGHT,

14:19.267 --> 14:20.733
AND WE GOT
OUR ORDERS MIXED UP,

14:20.767 --> 14:23.100
AND WHEN I GOT
MY ORDER BACK FROM HIM,

14:23.133 --> 14:25.200
ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT SHRIMP
WERE MISSING.

14:25.233 --> 14:26.633
OH, NO.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.233
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED,

14:28.267 --> 14:29.667
THE SHRIMP
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED.

14:29.700 --> 14:30.800
I DIDN'T TOUCH
YOUR SHRIMP.

14:30.833 --> 14:31.833
WHO GIVES A SHIT,
COME ON LARRY.

14:31.867 --> 14:33.267
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THE SHRIMP,

14:33.300 --> 14:35.567
I WOULD UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, YEAH.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.300
LOOK, LARRY, YOU GOT YOUR FOOD,
I GOT MY FOOD.

14:39.333 --> 14:42.467
YEAH, YOU GOT YOUR FULL ORDER,
I GOT MINE, MINUS SEVEN SHRIMP.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.700
YOU COUNTED THE SHRIMP,
YOU'RE A SHRIMP COUNTER NOW.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.900
WELL, IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
WHEN THERE'S TWO SHRIMP.

14:46.933 --> 14:47.900
RIGHT, LISTEN, LARRY,

14:47.933 --> 14:49.067
I DIDN'T TOUCH
YOUR FUCKING SHRIMP.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.233
REALLY ?

14:50.267 --> 14:51.833
IF YOU WANT SHRIMP,
TAKE YOUR $475 MILLION,

14:51.867 --> 14:52.833
AND GO BUY
A FUCKING SHRIMP BOAT.

14:52.867 --> 14:54.100
YEAH, OKAY.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.333
LARRY, COME ON.

14:55.367 --> 14:57.067
OH, HE'S GONNA
WALK OUT NOW.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.600
THIS IS WHAT
HE'S FAMOUS FOR.

14:58.633 --> 15:01.067
NOTHING CHANGES
IN 25 YEARS WITH THIS GUY.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.667
SAME SHIT.

15:07.133 --> 15:10.100
I'M SORRY,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

15:10.133 --> 15:11.133
I'M SO SORRY.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.500
WHAT WHERE YOU DOING ?
WHAT WAS THAT ?

15:12.533 --> 15:14.633
HE INSULTED ME.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.233
HOW ?

15:16.267 --> 15:18.333
HE IMPLIED THAT I WAS LYING
ABOUT MY STEPFATHER.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.633
YOU DON'T HAVE
A STEPFATHER.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.700
I KNOW, BUT I DIDN'T
LIKE THE IMPLICATION.

15:21.733 --> 15:23.133
THE IMPLICATION FOR
YOUR IMAGINARY STEPFATHER ?

15:23.167 --> 15:25.833
HOW CAN HE INSULT YOU ABOUT
SOMEBODY WHO'S IMAGINARY, LARRY.

15:25.867 --> 15:26.867
FOR GOODNESS SAKE...

15:26.900 --> 15:28.333
WELL, BECAUSE IT WAS...

15:28.367 --> 15:31.267
LET ME JUST ASK YOU SOMETHING,
WHAT IS THE SHRIMP BUSINESS ?

15:31.300 --> 15:33.933
WELL, HE GOT MY CONTAINER,
BY MISTAKE,

15:33.967 --> 15:36.400
FROM THE CHINESE RESTAURANT,
AND HE TOOK OUT EIGHT SHRIMP
FROM IT,

15:36.433 --> 15:38.800
THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO HIM,
AND THEN GAVE IT BACK TO ME.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.067
AS IF I WASN'T GONNA KNOW
THAT HE TOOK THE SHRIMP.

15:41.067 --> 15:42.467
WHAT DOES HE THINK,
I'M A MORON ?

15:42.500 --> 15:47.300
LARRY, EVERYBODY STEALS SHRIMP,
AND EVERYBODY LIES ABOUT IT.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.067
THIS IS HOLLYWOOD.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.133
YOU GOT TO APOLOGIZE
TO THIS GUY.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.133
PLEASE.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.400
YOU HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.533
WE WANT TO MAKE THIS HERE,
I WANT TO MAKE THIS HERE.

15:54.567 --> 15:55.567
COME ON,
GO APOLOGIZE.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.167
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.433
YOU HAVE TO GET YOURSELF
INTO MAJOR PSYCHOANALYSIS.

15:59.467 --> 16:01.433
OH, I'M IN ANALYSIS,
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:01.467 --> 16:02.467
WHAT KIND
OF ANALYSIS ?

16:02.500 --> 16:03.467
DOES NOTHING.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.800
APPARENTLY NOT.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.800
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT
YOUR IMAGINARY STEPFATHER ?

16:09.633 --> 16:10.800
I'LL TELL YOU THIS,
RIGHT NOW.

16:10.833 --> 16:11.833
WHAT ?

16:11.867 --> 16:13.100
I'M GOING BACK TO
THAT CHINESE RESTAURANT,

16:13.133 --> 16:14.367
AND I'M GONNA GO
COUNT THE SHRIMP

16:14.400 --> 16:16.233
AND ASK THEM HOW MANY
THEY PUT IN THE CONTAINER,

16:16.267 --> 16:17.433
AND I'LL BET YOU
THERE'S EIGHT MISSING, AT LEAST.

16:17.467 --> 16:18.767
YOU DO THAT !

16:18.800 --> 16:20.767
WHY DON'T
YOU DO THAT !

16:22.400 --> 16:23.567
( chattering )

16:23.600 --> 16:26.400
EVERYONE THE GAME
IS FIVE CARD STUD.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.167
ANTI UP THERE...

16:28.200 --> 16:29.533
SO, MICKEY,
WHAT DO YOU DO ?

16:29.567 --> 16:31.100
I'M A DENTIST.

16:31.133 --> 16:33.500
I'VE BEEN BRAD
AND JULIA'S DENTIST FOR YEARS.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.500
REALLY, MICKEY,
THAT IS GOOD TO KNOW,

16:35.533 --> 16:36.533
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
NEED A DENTIST,

16:36.567 --> 16:37.600
MINE JUST MOVED.

16:37.633 --> 16:38.867
OH, WELL, GIVE CANDY
A CALL ON MONDAY.

16:38.900 --> 16:39.933
I WILL.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.867
YOU KNOW,
MY DENTIST TOLD ME

16:41.900 --> 16:43.500
I HAVE THE GUMS
OF A 25-YEAR-OLD MAN.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.167
( laughing )

16:45.200 --> 16:50.400
I THINK IT WAS ABOUT
THE NICEST THING ANYONE'S
EVER SAID TO ME.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.500
EVERYTHING'S OKAY
WITH YOU AND ALAN, RIGHT ?

16:53.533 --> 16:55.333
LARRY, YOU GUYS ARE ALL
MADE UP AND EVERYTHING ?

16:55.367 --> 16:57.200
YES, WE KISSED
AND MADE UP.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.200
THIS IS THE UNFORTUNATE
SHRIMP INCIDENT ?

16:58.233 --> 16:59.200
YES, THAT'S THE ONE.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.300
I'VE BEEN DYING
TO HEAR THIS.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.533
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS,

17:01.567 --> 17:03.367
THERE WAS A MIX UP AT
A CHINESE TAKE OUT RESTAURANT,

17:03.400 --> 17:05.533
WHERE LARRY GOT ALAN'S ORDER,
AND ALAN, LARRY'S.

17:05.567 --> 17:06.767
AND I GUESS WHEN
THEY SWITCHED THEM BACK,

17:06.800 --> 17:09.167
ALAN HAD TAKEN SIX
OR SEVEN OF YOUR SHRIMP ?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.433
THAT'S MY CLAIM, YEAH.

17:11.467 --> 17:12.667
ALLEGEDLY.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.400
RIGHT, AND IT TURNED
INTO A BIG THING,

17:14.433 --> 17:15.500
AND HE STOMPED OUT
OF THE MEETING,

17:15.533 --> 17:16.900
WHICH I HAD
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

17:16.933 --> 17:19.533
I ALMOST THOUGHT
IT WAS NOT REAL, BUT IT WAS.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.700
SO, I SAW THE JACKSON POLLACK
MOVIE THE NIGHT BEFORE,

17:21.733 --> 17:26.067
AND I GOT VERY INFLUENCED
BY THE ARTIST, YOU KNOW.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.400
WELL, IT WAS
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

17:27.433 --> 17:30.167
BUT EVERYTHING'S FINE NOW,
AND WE'RE VERY DELIGHTED

17:30.200 --> 17:31.900
YOU GUYS ARE WITH "HBO",
VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU.

17:31.933 --> 17:32.933
WHERE ARE WE ?
I'VE LOST MY...

17:32.967 --> 17:34.700
I'M OUT, SHE'S OUT.

17:34.733 --> 17:36.067
I'M IN,
I'M IN.

17:36.067 --> 17:38.167
NO, YOU'RE NOT OUT,
SWEETIE, IT'S ONLY TWO.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.200
OH GOD, OKAY.

17:39.233 --> 17:40.500
OKAY, YOUR GOOD.

17:40.533 --> 17:41.933
ALRIGHT,
I'M SUCH A DITZ, OKAY.

17:41.967 --> 17:45.733
SO, LARRY, HOW COME YOU GUYS
DIDN'T TAKE THE SHOW TO "NBC",

17:45.767 --> 17:47.233
WITH THE HISTORY
YOU GUYS HAVE THERE ?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.500
CHERYL, YOU WANT
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ?

17:48.533 --> 17:49.533
BECAUSE
I WOULDN'T LET HIM.

17:49.567 --> 17:50.733
YOU WOULDN'T LET HIM ?

17:50.767 --> 17:53.600
NO, BECAUSE G.E.
WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

17:53.633 --> 17:56.200
FOR DUMPING THE P.C.P.'S
IN THE HUDSON RIVER.

17:56.233 --> 17:58.467
AND I SAY,
WHY KEEP SUPPORTING THEM,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.733
GOOD FOR YOU.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.967
BUT THE MAIN THING I WOULD
LIKE TO ADD IS THAT ON "HBO",

18:02.067 --> 18:03.967
YOU CAN SAY "FUCK".

18:04.067 --> 18:07.267
AND THAT IS, YOU KNOW,
VERY TEMPTING...

18:07.300 --> 18:10.300
SO YOU THROW IN A FUCK,
YOU DOUBLE YOUR LAUGHS.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.300
FUCK IS
A CROWD PLEASER.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.467
NEXT GAME.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.600
THE GAME IS...

18:15.633 --> 18:17.200
THE GAME IS GUTS.

18:17.233 --> 18:20.067
CARD SKILL GAME BRAD.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.533
NO ONE APPRECIATES GUTS,
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

18:22.567 --> 18:23.967
LET'S PLAY IT.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.233
TWO CARD GUTS
OR THREE CARD GUTS ?

18:25.267 --> 18:26.867
TWO CARD GUTS,
TWO CARDS DOWN.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.533
WHOEVER LOSES
HAS TO MATCH THE POT.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.067
WE KEEP BETTING
UNTIL PEOPLE DROP OUT.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.067
THIS IS STIFF.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.333
THIS COULD
BE RECORD-BREAKING.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.933
YOU SHOW BIZ TYPES
GET A LITTLE RICHER THAN THE...

18:40.967 --> 18:42.333
THE DENTAL PROFESSION.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.500
I'LL BET YOU THERE'S ABOUT
$800 IN THERE, YOU KNOW THAT ?

18:44.533 --> 18:45.800
I WOULD SAY AT LEAST.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.167
IT'S ALRIGHT.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.133
LET'S TRY.

18:50.567 --> 18:51.600
I'M IN.

18:51.633 --> 18:52.600
YES !

18:52.633 --> 18:54.400
I'M OUT.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.433
I CAN'T DO IT EITHER.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.600
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
ENOUGH TO COVER THAT.

18:56.633 --> 18:57.800
NOT A CHANCE.

18:57.833 --> 18:58.933
NO, I'M OUT.

18:58.967 --> 19:00.233
GO IN, SOMEBODY.

19:00.267 --> 19:01.233
YEAH.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.400
MELISSA, COME ON.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.967
NO, OUT.

19:04.067 --> 19:06.067
OH, MICHAEL...

19:06.067 --> 19:07.667
I'M HERE,
I'M HERE, UH...

19:07.700 --> 19:08.700
IN.

19:08.733 --> 19:09.933
I'M OUT,
NO, I'M OUT.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.200
MICHAEL.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.967
HALL YOU MUST GO IN,

19:13.067 --> 19:14.400
SHE'S GONNA STEAL
THE WHOLE THING.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.200
COME ON, DON'T LET
HER STEAL THIS THING.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.767
HOW MUCH IS THAT ?

19:17.800 --> 19:19.067
A LOT.

19:19.100 --> 19:21.133
IT'S ABOUT, SEVEN,
$800 IN THERE, COME ON.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.800
SEVEN, $800, OKAY.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.800
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

19:24.833 --> 19:26.067
I REALLY CAN'T DO IT,
I'VE GOT NOTHING...

19:26.067 --> 19:27.200
AAAAH !

19:27.233 --> 19:32.067
OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT THAT, HOLY COW.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.167
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL US
HOW MUCH THAT IS.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.333
WHAT DID YOU HAVE ?

19:35.367 --> 19:37.167
I HAD A SIX AND A 10.

19:37.200 --> 19:42.200
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU STOLE THIS POT.

19:42.233 --> 19:43.900
I'M SORRY.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.200
WHAT A BLUFF,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:45.233 --> 19:46.333
WHAT DID YOU HAVE ?

19:46.367 --> 19:47.667
I HAD NOTHING,
TWO AND A FOUR.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.433
TWO AND A FOUR,
THAT'S WHAT I HAD, NOTHING.

19:49.467 --> 19:50.600
WHAT DID YOU HAVE ?

19:50.633 --> 19:52.367
I AM AFRAID TO SAY,
I HAD AN ACE HIGH.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.900
ACE HIGH ?

19:53.933 --> 19:57.067
SWEETIE.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.133
HOW COULD YOU NOT GO IN
WITH AN ACE HIGH ?

19:59.167 --> 20:02.333
OH, YOU CUNT,
WHAT A CUNT !

20:02.367 --> 20:04.267
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU DIDN'T GO IN WITH THAT.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.467
I, I...

20:06.500 --> 20:08.767
I JUST THOUGHT SHE...

20:08.800 --> 20:11.200
OH, WHAT A HAND, THAT'S
A GREAT HAND FOR THIS GAME.

20:11.233 --> 20:13.133
UM...

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
WOW.

20:16.033 --> 20:17.033
LARRY,
I THINK...

20:17.067 --> 20:18.433
HOW COULD YOU NOT GO IN
WITH AN ACE HIGH ?

20:18.467 --> 20:21.167
LARRY, I THINK THAT'S KIND
OF A MISOGYNIST THING TO SAY.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.433
OH, COME ON,
I'M KIDDING AROUND.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.967
ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN
AT THIS TABLE, AND MYSELF,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.067
I AM OFFENDED BY THAT.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.833
OH, PLEASE,
WE'RE PLAYING POKER HERE.

20:27.867 --> 20:30.333
THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE
IS NOT ALLOWED IN A GAME,

20:30.367 --> 20:32.167
IN A DECENT GAME.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.800
THAT'S SO UNACCEPTABLE,
THAT'S NOT OKAY.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.467
IT'S OKAY, I'M FINE.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.600
IT'S FINE.

20:40.633 --> 20:42.133
IT'S NOT FINE.

20:42.167 --> 20:45.133
YOU KNOW WHAT,
TIME TO GO, HOW ABOUT THAT ?

20:45.167 --> 20:48.300
YEAH, I THINK
I'M GONNA CALL IT A NIGHT,

20:48.333 --> 20:51.033
AND THE PARISHES
ARE BACK NEXT WEEK, RIGHT ?

20:51.067 --> 20:53.367
YEAH, THEY'RE BACK
FROM THE GALAPAGOS.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.233
IT WAS NICE MEETING
YOU GUYS, THANK YOU.

20:55.267 --> 20:56.467
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.633
YEAH, I'M GONNA
CALL YOU ABOUT MY...

20:58.667 --> 20:59.667
YOU DO THAT,
CALL CANDY.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.567
BYE, THANKS FOR COMING.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.100
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU.

21:03.133 --> 21:05.300
I'M SORRY IF
I OFFENDED ANYONE.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.333
THANKS FOR COMING YOU GUYS,
IT WAS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.167
YEAH, WE'LL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.067
SO I GUESS WE PROBABLY
WON'T BE INVITED BACK

21:15.100 --> 21:17.433
TO THEIR POKER GAME.

21:17.467 --> 21:18.600
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

21:18.633 --> 21:19.633
YOU THINK ?

21:19.667 --> 21:20.833
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

21:20.867 --> 21:22.167
OH, COME ON.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.300
YOU JUST SHOUTED OUT
THE "C" WORD IN FRONT OF WOMEN,

21:24.333 --> 21:25.633
IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE,
YOU DON'T JUST...

21:25.667 --> 21:28.700
IT'S A WORD YOU USE WHEN
SOMEBODY DOESN'T ACT MANLY.

21:28.733 --> 21:31.200
AND HE DIDN'T ACT MANLY,
HE SHOULD'VE GONE IN.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.933
HE SHOULD'VE GONE IN
WITH THAT ACE.

21:32.967 --> 21:35.133
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WORDS
THAT YOU COULD USE,

21:35.167 --> 21:36.667
BESIDES THAT ONE.

21:36.700 --> 21:40.900
WELL, MAYBE IN RETROSPECT,
I SHOULD'VE SAID PUSSY.

21:44.167 --> 21:45.267
GEEZ, I CAN'T BE...

21:45.300 --> 21:46.833
I'M REALLY SHOCKED.

21:46.867 --> 21:48.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT GUY
CALLED ME A MISOGYNIST.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.933
NOBODY EVER
CALLED ME THAT BEFORE.

21:49.967 --> 21:52.300
WELL, MAYBE YOU ARE.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.467
MAYBE, I'M LEARNING
THINGS ABOUT YOU.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.733
MAYBE, I AM
A MISOGYNIST.

21:55.767 --> 21:57.133
MAYBE I LIKE TO BEAT
MY WIFE A LITTLE BIT, HUH ?

21:57.167 --> 21:58.333
OW, OW, WAIT, NO.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.600
YOU LITTLE BITCH.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.900
AAH NO !

22:05.900 --> 22:08.800
OKAY, I'LL BE GOOD,
I PROMISE.

22:08.833 --> 22:10.467
BUCKLE UP !

22:10.500 --> 22:11.800
I'M BUCKLING.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.800
AND WASSERMANN SAYS
THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE.

22:21.833 --> 22:22.933
THIS IS IT.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.900
'CAUSE OF WHAT
YOU SAID TO HALBREICH.

22:24.933 --> 22:26.167
AND ALL OF
THE WOMEN AT "HBO",

22:26.200 --> 22:27.233
THEY DON'T WANT
TO WORK WITH YOU.

22:27.267 --> 22:28.467
OH, COME ON,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.933
THEY THINK
YOU'RE A MISOGYNIST.

22:29.967 --> 22:32.100
WHY, 'CAUSE I CALLED
THE GUY A CUNT, SO WHAT !

22:32.133 --> 22:33.467
'CAUSE YOU CALLED
THE GUY A CUNT.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.300
BIG DEAL, I CALL MEN
"PRICKS" ALL THE TIME,

22:35.333 --> 22:36.300
MEN WANT
TO WORK WITH ME.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.567
WELL, CUNT'S WORSE.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.433
CUNT'S NOT WORSE,
PRICKS AND CUNTS, THEY'RE EQUAL.

22:39.467 --> 22:40.500
PRICKS, CUNTS,
COME ON.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.567
THEY BALANCE OUT.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.167
NO, CUNT'S
MUCH HEAVIER.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.633
WHY IS CUNT HEAVIER ?

22:44.667 --> 22:46.067
I NEVER QUESTIONED,
IT JUST IS.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.867
THAT'S SEXIST
TO ME, COME ON.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.933
MICHAEL HALBREICH
TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

22:51.967 --> 22:53.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

22:53.100 --> 22:55.100
FROM YOU CALLING HIM A CUNT,
HE'S SHELL-SHOCKED,

22:55.133 --> 22:57.733
AND HE'S EXAMINING
EVERYTHING IN HIS LIFE.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.433
TAKING A LEAVE
OF ABSENCE.

22:59.467 --> 23:04.367
MAN, IS THAT SO ?

23:04.400 --> 23:05.867
YEAH.

23:05.900 --> 23:10.800
SHIT, I THOUGHT HE WAS ONE OF
THOSE EFFEMINATE HETEROSEXUALS.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.800
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS
AN EFFEMINATE HETEROSEXUAL.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.500
YOU'RE EITHER GAY
OR YOU'RE NOT GAY.

23:14.533 --> 23:17.367
HE WAS GAY,
HE'S GAY.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.867
HI, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE SEATED ?

23:18.900 --> 23:21.633
NO, ACTUALLY, I'M A LITTLE
CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING,

23:21.667 --> 23:22.967
WE'RE HAVING
A LITTLE DISPUTE.

23:23.067 --> 23:26.400
HOW MANY SHRIMP DO YOU GENERALLY
PUT IN THE KUNG PAO SHRIMP ?

23:26.433 --> 23:28.067
11.

23:28.067 --> 23:29.467
YOU ALWAYS PUT IN 11 ?

23:29.500 --> 23:32.367
WE HAVE A VERY
STRICT POLICY ABOUT THAT.

23:36.133 --> 23:38.200
THANK YOU,
VERY MUCH.

23:38.933 --> 23:40.600
HI, MICKEY.

23:40.633 --> 23:41.700
OH, SO IT'S
THIS CHERYL.

23:41.733 --> 23:43.100
YES, GOOD TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.367
GOOD TO SEE
YOU AGAIN.

23:44.400 --> 23:48.567
WELL, THAT WAS
QUITE A POKER GAME...

23:48.600 --> 23:49.567
YES.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.067
I DON'T THINK WE EVER
HAD ONE LIKE THAT.

23:52.067 --> 23:55.367
YEAH, LARRY CAN GET
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY SOMETIMES,

23:55.400 --> 23:56.433
I GUESS.

23:56.467 --> 23:58.433
HE TAKES
HIS POKER VERY...

24:00.100 --> 24:06.267
OH, THIS BRUISE,
THERE'S A FUNNY STORY HERE.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.567
CHERYL, UM, I...

24:08.600 --> 24:10.967
I BARELY KNOW YOU,

24:11.067 --> 24:15.067
BUT WHEN WE WERE COMING OUT OF
THE POKER GAME THE OTHER NIGHT,

24:15.067 --> 24:18.133
WE SAW INTO YOUR CAR,

24:18.167 --> 24:22.867
AND WE SAW LARRY
HITTING YOU.

24:24.200 --> 24:29.300
OKAY, UM...

24:29.333 --> 24:32.833
THIS IS, LARRY AND I DO
A LITTLE BIT SOMETIMES,

24:32.867 --> 24:34.667
WHERE HE ACTS LIKE
HE'S PUNCHING ME,

24:34.700 --> 24:37.067
AND I ACT LIKE,
"AAH, I'M GETTING HURT".

24:37.067 --> 24:39.067
UH, WE JUST
KIND OF DO...

24:39.067 --> 24:40.433
YOU'LL HAVE
TO EXCUSE ME,

24:40.467 --> 24:44.167
I DON'T DEAL
WITH THIS KIND OF THING OFTEN,

24:44.200 --> 24:47.467
BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO TALK WITH ME ABOUT THIS,

24:47.500 --> 24:53.233
IN THIS CUBICLE,
WE HAVE PATIENT,
DOCTOR CONFIDENTIALITY.

24:53.267 --> 24:57.067
UH-UH, AND THAT APPLIES
TO DENTISTS TOO ?

24:57.100 --> 25:00.667
OH, I THINK SO.

25:00.700 --> 25:04.867
I THINK WE'RE ON
THE WRONG PAGE HERE.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.867
YEAH, I HAVE A VERY GOOD
SOCIAL WORKER FRIEND,

25:07.900 --> 25:11.467
MICKEY, LISTEN, THIS IS
A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.967
THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDING
WHAT WE SAW LARRY DO TO MICHAEL

25:15.067 --> 25:16.133
AT THAT CARD GAME.

25:16.167 --> 25:17.633
THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDING

25:17.667 --> 25:20.067
THAT I SAW HIM BEATING YOU
IN YOUR CAR.

25:20.067 --> 25:22.467
I HAVE SEEN
LARRY DAVID IN ACTION,

25:22.500 --> 25:24.667
AND THAT MAN
IS AN ANIMAL,

25:24.700 --> 25:27.200
AND HE HAS
TO BE STOPPED !

25:29.067 --> 25:30.667
LARRY ?

25:33.833 --> 25:36.133
SO THAT'S IT,
IT'S ALL OVER AT "HBO".

25:36.167 --> 25:39.633
DENTIST GOT IN TOUCH
WITH WASSERMANN,

25:39.667 --> 25:41.267
THINKS I'M
A WIFE BEATER.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.967
HE THINKS
I'M A WIFE BEATER.

25:43.067 --> 25:44.067
I MEAN,
IT'S SO CRAZY.

25:44.067 --> 25:45.067
I KNOW.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.067
THERE'S OTHER NETWORKS,
RIGHT ?

25:47.067 --> 25:49.067
THIS IS NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, "HBO".

25:49.067 --> 25:50.967
WE'LL GO TO "ABC".

25:51.067 --> 25:52.333
I DON'T HAVE
TO BE AT "HBO".

25:52.367 --> 25:53.633
NO.

25:53.667 --> 25:54.933
IT'S NOT T.V.,
IT'S T.V.

25:54.967 --> 25:56.267
WHAT DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING ?

25:56.300 --> 25:58.067
YEAH.

25:58.067 --> 25:59.367
WATCH IT ON T.V.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.900
THEY DON'T GO TO
THE MOVIES TO SEE IT.

26:00.933 --> 26:02.567
HOW ARE WE DOING
OVER HERE, FOLKS, OKAY ?

26:02.600 --> 26:03.667
I THINK I'M DONE.

26:03.700 --> 26:04.700
CAN I GET THIS OUT
OF THE WAY FOR YOU ?

26:04.733 --> 26:05.700
OKAY, GREAT.

26:05.733 --> 26:06.700
DELICIOUS.

26:06.733 --> 26:07.700
YOU LIKE IT ?

26:07.733 --> 26:09.067
GREAT.YEAH.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.067
HOW ABOUT DESSERT MENU,
WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD STUFF ?

26:10.100 --> 26:11.733
UM, YEAH, EXCELLENT.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.133
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK
WE'LL JUST TAKE THE BILL.

26:13.167 --> 26:14.200
YOU SURE ?

26:14.233 --> 26:15.333
OKAY, I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.633
LET'S GO TO SHUTTERS,
AND GET DESSERT THERE.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.233
JUST GET A CHANGE
OF SCENERY.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.800
YOU DON'T WANT
DESSERT HERE ?

26:21.833 --> 26:25.367
IT WOULD JUST BE MORE FUN
TO GO SOME PLACE ELSE.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.300
RELAX BY THE BEACH.

26:29.433 --> 26:30.633
WHY, BUT WE'RE
ALREADY HERE ?

26:30.667 --> 26:31.767
WE COULD HAVE DESSERT
IN TWO MINUTES,

26:31.800 --> 26:32.800
THEN WE COULD...

26:32.833 --> 26:35.400
BUT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT
JUST THE DESSERT.

26:35.433 --> 26:36.667
WHAT'S IT ABOUT ?

26:36.700 --> 26:38.600
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF AN ADVENTURE

26:38.633 --> 26:40.233
TO GO SOME PLACE ELSE
AND SEE SOMETHING NEW.

26:40.267 --> 26:41.800
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
ANY ADVENTURE, REALLY.

26:41.833 --> 26:42.933
THAT'S AN ADVENTURE.

26:42.967 --> 26:43.967
THAT'S AN ADVENTURE ?

26:44.067 --> 26:48.333
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.

26:48.367 --> 26:49.800
I JUST
DON'T GET IT.

26:49.833 --> 26:51.500
I MEAN, BECAUSE
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

26:51.533 --> 26:52.500
WHERE HAVING A MEAL...

26:52.533 --> 26:53.700
WE'RE HAVING
A GOOD TIME,

26:53.733 --> 26:55.067
AND I JUST SUGGEST
TO GO TO SOMETHING...

26:55.067 --> 26:56.867
YOU'RE BREAKING UP
THE GOOD TIME TO..

26:56.900 --> 26:58.833
YOU'RE BREAKING UP
THE GOOD TIME.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.100
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE
I WANT A CUP OF COFFEE
AFTER I EAT DINNER.

27:01.133 --> 27:02.267
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE GETTING UP

27:02.300 --> 27:04.067
AND GOING TO A CAR
AND DRIVING SOME PLACE,

27:04.100 --> 27:06.933
YOU KNOW, LARRY,
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GO HOME.

27:09.067 --> 27:12.067
QUICK CUP OF DECAF ?

27:15.067 --> 27:18.633
CAN I GET IT TO GO ?

27:18.667 --> 27:20.367
THAT'S DIFFERENT,
THOUGH.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.567
( knocking )

27:28.600 --> 27:30.867
ARE YOU MRS. DAVID ?

27:30.900 --> 27:31.933
YES, I AM.

27:31.967 --> 27:34.267
HI, I'M LINDA JOHNSON
FROM SOCIAL SERVICES.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.867
WE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL
THAT THERE WAS SOME

27:35.900 --> 27:37.933
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
GOING ON IN THIS HOUSEHOLD ?

27:37.967 --> 27:41.533
OH, ACTUALLY, THIS IS ALL
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

27:42.533 --> 27:44.667
OH, YEAH, THIS.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.467
WOULD YOU CARE
TO PRESS CHARGES ?
