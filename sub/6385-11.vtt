on californication...</i>

00:02.398 --> 00:04.149
- i'd like to introduce you
to richard bates, the writer.

00:04.183 --> 00:05.484
- big fan.

00:05.518 --> 00:07.953
- who wants to see me tuck
and do the pee pee dance?

00:07.987 --> 00:09.187
- [laughs loudly]
- [growls]

00:09.205 --> 00:11.573
- whoa!

00:11.624 --> 00:13.875
- we're really gonna do this,
sell the place?

00:13.910 --> 00:16.461
- isn't that what we want?
- yeah, sure. i guess.

00:16.496 --> 00:18.297
- i just want to be done
with it already.

00:18.331 --> 00:19.865
I want to sell
this fucking house

00:19.899 --> 00:21.249
And get on
with the rest of my life.

00:21.301 --> 00:23.468
- so what, you're saying
just pack up and leave l.a.?

00:23.503 --> 00:25.420
The three of us move back
to new york together?

00:25.471 --> 00:28.056
- yeah, end of the semester,
whatever.

00:28.091 --> 00:29.725
[crunches loudly]

00:29.759 --> 00:31.009
- so which one
are you sleeping with?

00:31.043 --> 00:32.177
- excuse me?

00:32.211 --> 00:34.513
- my bets are on
the young, voluptuous student.

00:34.547 --> 00:36.982
- this is so not fair.

00:37.016 --> 00:39.384
- i'm in love with you,
hank moody.

00:39.402 --> 00:40.736
- ho--

00:40.770 --> 00:42.938
- i've never stepped
outside of my marriage before.

00:42.989 --> 00:44.489
Please, go.

00:44.524 --> 00:45.524
Oh.

00:45.558 --> 00:46.742
- oh, something
must be different.

00:46.776 --> 00:48.610
Oh, that's right.
you fucked my wife.

00:48.661 --> 00:49.894
- well, there's that.

00:49.912 --> 00:51.279
- what does that mean?
- it's not my fault.

00:51.331 --> 00:52.614
- you didn't tell her?
- tell me what?

00:52.665 --> 00:54.700
- becca's father and i
had a slight indiscretion.

00:54.734 --> 00:56.952
- she's got to be
kidding me, right?

00:57.003 --> 00:59.338
I don't want to hear about
felicia and her midlife crisis.

00:59.372 --> 01:01.590
- wait, who else
has he been fucking?

01:01.624 --> 01:02.624
- you're a goddamn
girl whisperer.

01:02.675 --> 01:03.925
- okay.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.927
- i can't believe
you slept with all of them.

01:05.962 --> 01:08.296
- will you live?
- i'm trying.

01:08.348 --> 01:09.881
- well, that's all
anybody can ask for.

01:09.915 --> 01:11.433
Oh, hey, check this out.

01:25.365 --> 01:29.534
Lordy bagordy, we made
some fucking love, woman.

01:29.569 --> 01:31.870
<i>they should put us
in the joy of sex--</i>

01:31.904 --> 01:34.206
A nice little pencil sketch
of us doing it.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.374
We're that good.

01:35.408 --> 01:38.377
- [laughs]
who are you right now?

01:38.411 --> 01:41.380
- i'm not sensing
the same level of enthusiasm.

01:41.414 --> 01:44.549
- oh, no.
i--it was good.

01:44.584 --> 01:46.551
- come to think of it,
you weren't quite as vocal

01:46.586 --> 01:47.803
As you normally are.

01:47.837 --> 01:49.971
I mean, you've never been
a screamer per se,

01:50.006 --> 01:53.392
But i can always count on you
for a little intense moaning.

01:53.426 --> 01:54.976
[mimicking karen's moaning]

01:55.011 --> 01:56.795
- hank, stop it.
- [mimicking continues]

01:56.813 --> 01:59.398
- thank you.
thank you for that.

01:59.432 --> 02:01.983
A woman does love
a reenactment

02:02.018 --> 02:04.236
Of the most vulnerable moment.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.821
- oh, baby.

02:05.855 --> 02:08.023
But you got there, right?

02:09.692 --> 02:11.693
- close.

02:11.744 --> 02:14.496
- oh, i see what you're saying.
it was, like, a tiny one.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.164
That happens.
that's understandable.

02:16.199 --> 02:17.999
- not so much.

02:18.034 --> 02:19.918
- what?
are you serious?

02:19.952 --> 02:21.837
You mean
not even a little one,

02:21.871 --> 02:23.672
Like a micro-orgasm?
- no.

02:23.706 --> 02:26.208
- are you sure?
jesus, this is upsetting.

02:26.259 --> 02:28.844
- the truth is, hank,
we've been through some--

02:28.878 --> 02:31.213
We've been through
some really hard times.

02:31.264 --> 02:32.681
- i know that.
- so--

02:32.715 --> 02:36.685
- but we've always had
our fire and our passion.

02:36.719 --> 02:39.688
Our beautiful sex organs
don't know about our problems,

02:39.722 --> 02:41.523
And we should definitely
keep them out of it.

02:41.557 --> 02:43.308
You got to give me another
chance to please you, woman.

02:43.342 --> 02:44.643
- no.
no, no, no, no.

02:44.677 --> 02:46.111
We, we can't.
it's too late.

02:46.145 --> 02:48.697
It's not gonna work.
no, there's too much pressure.

02:48.731 --> 02:51.283
Ah! no, no, no.
anyway, we have plans.

02:51.317 --> 02:53.869
- it's saturday.
i can do this all day.

02:53.903 --> 02:55.871
- felicia.

02:55.905 --> 02:57.456
- felicia.
- your new friend.

02:57.490 --> 02:58.490
- what?
- yes.

02:58.524 --> 02:59.825
- no.
- she invited us for lunch.

02:59.859 --> 03:01.159
- oh.
- i know.

03:01.193 --> 03:03.211
And i had to say yes, because--
- no, you didn't.

03:03.246 --> 03:05.380
- god, that woman
is so annoying.

03:05.414 --> 03:06.915
She's so irritating.
argh!

03:06.966 --> 03:07.999
- ooh, yeah, that's good.

03:08.033 --> 03:10.252
Like that,
only louder and deeper.

03:10.303 --> 03:12.003
I can work with that.
- no, no, no, no, it's over.

03:12.037 --> 03:14.005
- me love you long time.
- ah. it's over.

03:14.039 --> 03:15.340
I got to go.
- oh...

03:15.374 --> 03:16.508
- i got to get ready.

03:16.542 --> 03:19.678
- all right.
just give me a moment...

03:19.712 --> 03:23.482
While i talk my testicles
into descending.

03:23.516 --> 03:26.601
[faucet turns on]

03:26.652 --> 03:27.936

[woman laughing]

04:15.935 --> 04:18.536
- wow.

04:18.571 --> 04:20.988
Looks like there's some kind
of a book club or something.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.624
- of a sort.

04:22.658 --> 04:24.659
[indistinct chatter]

04:24.710 --> 04:25.994
Oh, dear.

04:26.045 --> 04:28.713
- at least it won't be
a dull saturday afternoon.

04:28.748 --> 04:32.250
- welcome.
hello. come in.

04:32.284 --> 04:34.252
Oh, you shouldn't have.
thank you.

04:34.286 --> 04:35.921
- no, it is you
who shouldn't have.

04:35.955 --> 04:38.006
This is quite a surprise.

04:38.057 --> 04:39.841
- i think pleasure is the word
you were looking for.

04:39.892 --> 04:41.343
- or surprise.

04:41.394 --> 04:42.644
- they all heard
that i was having you over.

04:42.678 --> 04:44.679
- guess the whole
ya-ya sisterhood

04:44.730 --> 04:46.014
Had to get in on it, huh?

04:46.065 --> 04:48.183
- yeah, well,
we can't let you skip town

04:48.234 --> 04:49.601
Without a fond farewell.

04:49.635 --> 04:51.519
- oh, yeah, our last class
was very unsatisfying,

04:51.571 --> 04:53.188
Since you
didn't teach us anything.

04:53.239 --> 04:55.023
- karen?
this is jill.

04:55.074 --> 04:57.659
She was hank's teaching
assistant this semester,

04:57.693 --> 04:59.494
And that's jackie.

04:59.528 --> 05:01.363
- hey, jackie.
we--we met in class, right?

05:01.414 --> 05:03.582
- we were all there--
- in a way.

05:03.616 --> 05:05.450
- why--why don't i come
with you guys?

05:05.484 --> 05:07.953
We can hang out,
try on some lip gloss,

05:07.987 --> 05:09.120
You know, sparkly?

05:09.154 --> 05:10.422
- you made your bed.

05:10.456 --> 05:13.375
- yeah, and now you're gonna
have to lie in it.

05:13.426 --> 05:14.659
Have fun, hank.

05:21.267 --> 05:25.003
- wake the fuck up, runkle.

05:25.021 --> 05:27.472
[exhales sharply]
open house time.

05:27.506 --> 05:29.173
You know the house
won't sell

05:29.191 --> 05:31.676
If we're
within five miles of it.

05:31.694 --> 05:34.012
- give me ten minutes,
ten minutes.

05:34.030 --> 05:37.232
Come on!
we got to jet.

05:37.283 --> 05:39.851
Buyers can smell
our impending divorce

05:39.869 --> 05:41.319
From the freeway.

05:41.353 --> 05:44.022
- coming!
i'm coming.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.790
- oh, my god. oh, my god.
oh, my god.

05:45.825 --> 05:48.243
- oh, god, you really
are coming. barf.

05:48.294 --> 05:49.828
- i told you.

05:49.862 --> 05:50.912
And i told you.

05:50.963 --> 05:53.214
She never fucking listens,
am i right?

05:56.969 --> 05:57.919
- hi.

05:57.970 --> 05:59.304
Um, you must be marcy.
i'm--

05:59.338 --> 06:01.640
- getting your pants and getting
the fuck out of my house.

06:01.674 --> 06:03.642
Now, please.
thank you.

06:03.676 --> 06:06.227
There's a good girl.
off you go.

06:06.262 --> 06:08.146
Yeah.

06:08.180 --> 06:10.765
- i'll call you.
- [scoffs]

06:10.816 --> 06:13.068
Really?
the floor, that's your move?

06:13.102 --> 06:14.402
- you said
not to mess up the bed

06:14.437 --> 06:15.553
If we're showing the house.

06:15.571 --> 06:17.022
- christ, runkle!

06:17.056 --> 06:18.907
- oh, i'm sorry she's not
a coke-snorting teen idol

06:18.941 --> 06:20.659
Or a big black rapist.

06:20.693 --> 06:22.527
Not everyone can have
class up the ass.

06:22.561 --> 06:25.697
- no ass, just class.

06:29.201 --> 06:30.335
- oh, my god.

06:30.369 --> 06:32.671
I could take the stubbornness,
really i could,

06:32.705 --> 06:35.206
And the substance abuse
and the lateness

06:35.240 --> 06:37.459
And the "cooler than school
and all the rest of us

06:37.510 --> 06:38.593
Ne'er do well" attitude,

06:38.627 --> 06:40.929
But the thing
that absolutely got me

06:40.963 --> 06:44.265
Was the unwarranted advice
about my biological clock.

06:44.300 --> 06:48.186
- oh, but, you know,
he's fully qualified to do that,

06:48.220 --> 06:50.105
Because he has such
a deep understanding

06:50.139 --> 06:51.222
Of womanhood.

06:51.256 --> 06:52.857
- shouldn't you be defending me?
- yes!

06:52.892 --> 06:54.642
- you, talking up
my good points?

06:54.694 --> 06:56.528
- well, yeah, i will later.

06:56.562 --> 06:58.530
Right now i'm really enjoying

06:58.564 --> 07:02.033
This kind of appraisal
of your little idiosyncrasies,

07:02.068 --> 07:04.619
You know, the things
that i have grown to know

07:04.653 --> 07:06.121
And love about you.

07:06.155 --> 07:07.906
- yeah, well, the cracks--
that's how the light gets in.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.791
- more pimm's, anyone?

07:09.825 --> 07:11.109
- oh, yeah, hit me with that.

07:11.127 --> 07:13.161
You know, it's not an act--
this whole thing.

07:13.212 --> 07:15.630
I'm--i'm very sensitive to
the pain and suffering of women.

07:15.664 --> 07:17.966
I listen to them.
i'm aware of that shit.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.335
- okay, yeah, that's true.
- yeah, thank you.

07:20.386 --> 07:22.754
- in his defense,
i must say that he paid me

07:22.788 --> 07:24.672
Tons of special attention
in class.

07:24.724 --> 07:25.840
- not special.

07:25.891 --> 07:28.259
- no, jackie.
he did not.

07:28.293 --> 07:30.311
- jackie's writing's
actually very good.

07:30.346 --> 07:32.147
I-i read some
of her short stories, darling.

07:32.181 --> 07:33.848
- you have.
- yeah, sure i have.

07:33.899 --> 07:35.400
I had to write her
a recommendation

07:35.434 --> 07:36.818
To the graduate
writing program.

07:36.852 --> 07:38.319
She couldn't very well
ask you.

07:38.354 --> 07:40.655
- hey, when is luncheon
gonna be served?

07:40.689 --> 07:42.323
That's why we're here, right?

07:42.358 --> 07:43.658
And i'm curious.

07:43.692 --> 07:45.827
I want to know how it's
different from actual lunch.

07:45.861 --> 07:49.414
- well, we have one last guest,
who's a late arrival.

07:49.448 --> 07:50.832
Oh, here's the latecomer now.

07:50.866 --> 07:53.168
- it's not a lady.
please say not a lady.

07:53.202 --> 07:55.920
- mm...
- oh, my--

07:55.955 --> 07:57.872
Is that richard bates?

07:57.923 --> 07:59.924
<i>- yeah, richard bates,
crack the sky, you know him?</i>

07:59.959 --> 08:02.343
- know him?
- yeah.

08:02.378 --> 08:04.045
- karen, is that you?

08:04.096 --> 08:05.346
- richard.

08:05.381 --> 08:08.299
- oh, my god,
you look exactly the same.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.635
- exactly the same
as what exactly?

08:10.669 --> 08:12.637
- i mean, even more beautiful.
- my god.

08:12.671 --> 08:14.973
- i can picture you right now
standing under the arch

08:15.007 --> 08:17.776
In washington square park,
wind blowing your hair.

08:17.810 --> 08:19.944
- and you blowing me off,
you asshole.

08:19.979 --> 08:22.147
- oh, asshole--
i like where this is going,

08:22.181 --> 08:23.948
Him being
an asshole and all,

08:23.983 --> 08:27.035
But you want to fill me in
on the--the rest of this shit?

08:27.069 --> 08:28.820
- oh, my g--you gave me a "c."
- oh, please.

08:28.854 --> 08:30.538
- i mean, like, when you sleep
with your professor,

08:30.573 --> 08:33.207
Isn't that, like,
you're meant to get a "b"?

08:33.241 --> 08:35.626
- hey, what,
you slept with him?

08:35.660 --> 08:36.878
The glorious "mangina" here?

08:36.912 --> 08:38.746
- this is my professor
that i had an affair with

08:38.798 --> 08:39.964
As an undergraduate.

08:39.999 --> 08:42.299
I mean, i know it's, like,
100 years ago.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.836
- you know,
it feels just like yesterday.

08:44.870 --> 08:46.004
- worst day of my life.

08:46.038 --> 08:48.173
- god, you look great.
- thank you.

08:48.207 --> 08:50.341
Well, you're not
with bush league here, are you?

08:50.375 --> 08:51.593
- oh--
- fuck, yeah, she...is.

08:51.644 --> 08:55.180
- well, kind of.
- really?

08:55.214 --> 08:56.981
- what?

08:57.016 --> 08:59.517
No, do--don't keep secrets
from the rest of the class.

08:59.551 --> 09:01.519
- you planted the seed--
that writer thing,

09:01.553 --> 09:03.771
My attraction to writers.

09:03.823 --> 09:06.274
- oh, hey, hey, hey.
have a drink.

09:06.325 --> 09:07.609
- [laughs]

09:07.660 --> 09:09.994
- how'd you snag her, anyway--

09:10.029 --> 09:12.080
The old "i'm an agent" spiel?

09:12.114 --> 09:15.033
- hey, it's not a spiel.
i'm an agent.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.502
She has a dream,
she's a waitress.

09:17.536 --> 09:19.537
- in your language,
waitress means stripper.

09:19.571 --> 09:20.705
She's a stripper.

09:20.739 --> 09:21.906
- no, no, no.

09:21.924 --> 09:24.092
She is a cocktail waitress
with a screenplay.

09:24.126 --> 09:26.127
- [snorts]
- okay, okay.

09:26.178 --> 09:27.962
An idea for a screenplay.

09:28.013 --> 09:30.014
Still, i see potential,
and i just--

09:30.049 --> 09:32.550
- oh, please.
you see blow job.

09:32.584 --> 09:36.020
- do i detect a note
of jealousy?

09:36.055 --> 09:37.805
- mm.

09:37.857 --> 09:40.475
Like i could be jealous
of a food-service professional

09:40.526 --> 09:43.111
With an idea
for a screenplay

09:43.145 --> 09:44.279
And her boobs.

09:44.313 --> 09:45.480
- [laughs]
you are.

09:45.531 --> 09:47.649
Marcy runkle is jealous.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.317
I never thought
i'd see the day.

09:49.368 --> 09:51.152
- eh.
go with god.

09:51.203 --> 09:53.621
I got mine.
it's only right you get yours.

09:53.656 --> 09:57.325
- hey, marcy,
i have said all along

09:57.376 --> 09:59.827
I still love you.

09:59.879 --> 10:01.579
- it's not
what you say, charlie.

10:01.613 --> 10:02.997
- what do you mean?

10:03.048 --> 10:04.832
- it's out of sight,
out of mind.

10:04.884 --> 10:06.668
See marcy, want marcy.

10:06.719 --> 10:09.220
No see marcy,
want boobies.

10:09.255 --> 10:11.639
<i>[cell phone ringtone plays
jessie's girl]</i>

10:11.674 --> 10:13.791
- really? still?

10:13.809 --> 10:16.460
- jesus fuck,
i forgot to change my ringtone.

10:16.478 --> 10:17.628
- please allow me.

10:17.646 --> 10:20.515
Eat my bent wang,
rick springfield.

10:20.566 --> 10:23.017
- wait, get that.
it's sharon.

10:23.068 --> 10:24.018
- oh.

10:24.069 --> 10:26.487
- sharon.

10:26.522 --> 10:27.972
Mm-hmm.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.473
You're shitting me.

10:29.491 --> 10:30.858
Yeah.

10:30.910 --> 10:34.078
[cell phone beeps]

10:34.113 --> 10:35.246
We have an offer.

10:35.281 --> 10:38.199
- oh!

10:38.250 --> 10:39.701
- where were you off to
when you dumped me?

10:39.752 --> 10:40.702
Was it nepal?

10:40.753 --> 10:43.121
- it was egypt.

10:43.155 --> 10:45.373
You know,
i etched your name in stone

10:45.424 --> 10:46.674
Atop the pyramid at giza.

10:46.709 --> 10:49.010
- i wish that were true.
- bullshit!

10:49.044 --> 10:50.094
- [laughs]
- jesus christ.

10:50.129 --> 10:51.679
Staying home
is very nice too.

10:51.714 --> 10:53.214
It's cozy.

10:53.265 --> 10:55.166
You don't need a passport,
no shots.

10:55.184 --> 10:56.384
- so overall
you would recommend

10:56.435 --> 10:58.937
The experience
of sleeping with your teacher?

10:58.971 --> 11:00.671
- you see that? you see
what you've gone and done?

11:00.689 --> 11:02.173
You've set
a bad example, woman.

11:02.191 --> 11:03.441
- you were just so sexy.

11:03.475 --> 11:05.026
- you know, i can't exactly
be judgmental,

11:05.060 --> 11:07.845
Because that is
how i met chelsea's father.

11:07.863 --> 11:09.513
I was in graduate school,

11:09.531 --> 11:12.533
And i took one of his ridiculous
civil war classes.

11:12.568 --> 11:13.684
Loved to teach,

11:13.702 --> 11:15.519
You know, so passionate
about what he was doing.

11:15.537 --> 11:16.520
- that's it.

11:16.538 --> 11:18.022
You were so passionate.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.741
That--that's what turns me on.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.243
I just--the passion...
- yes, but that kind of passion,

11:22.294 --> 11:23.694
That burns you out.

11:23.712 --> 11:26.197
<i>that kind of intensity,
no bueno.</i>

11:26.215 --> 11:28.082
- look at him.
he's not burnt out.

11:28.133 --> 11:30.368
- the man had
a serious breakdown recently.

11:30.386 --> 11:34.422
Public nudity and singing.

11:34.473 --> 11:35.840
Smuggling dr. johnson.

11:35.874 --> 11:38.542
- oh, my poor love.
i'm so sorry.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.560
- don't be.

11:39.595 --> 11:41.045
Truthfully,
it was the best thing

11:41.063 --> 11:42.546
That's happened to me
in years.

11:42.564 --> 11:44.382
For a man to be just
broken down

11:44.400 --> 11:47.435
To his most naked,
most vulnerable self.

11:47.486 --> 11:49.153
- mm-hmm.

11:49.188 --> 11:51.155
- just stripped of all irony,
all vanity.

11:51.190 --> 11:52.774
I mean, i don't think
i've ever been

11:52.825 --> 11:55.827
So deeply in touch
with my feminine side.

11:55.861 --> 11:57.028
- oh, my god,
that's beautiful.

11:57.062 --> 11:58.562
- no, it wasn't.
it was queer.

11:58.580 --> 12:01.282
A-and not queer as in gay--
it was queer as in odd.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.950
Downright lunatic,
as a matter of fact.

12:03.002 --> 12:05.670
And i had to step in
for him at that point

12:05.704 --> 12:08.172
With my passion,
my intensity,

12:08.207 --> 12:10.341
'cause i'm all about
that stuff.

12:10.376 --> 12:11.793
- yeah, the guy
who once fell asleep

12:11.844 --> 12:13.761
During his own lecture.
- one time--

12:13.796 --> 12:15.013
I did that one time.

12:15.047 --> 12:17.015
I was boring myself,
and i thought

12:17.049 --> 12:19.750
It was an honest reaction
to actually fall asleep.

12:19.768 --> 12:21.102
- well, moody,
word on the street

12:21.136 --> 12:22.854
Is you couldn't teach your way
out of a paper bag.

12:22.888 --> 12:24.772
- where'd you hear that?

12:24.807 --> 12:26.557
- oh, i may have lobbed
a few random emails

12:26.591 --> 12:27.725
Here and there.

12:27.759 --> 12:29.477
- moody!

12:29.528 --> 12:30.645
[slams door]

12:30.696 --> 12:32.864
- that sounds like stacy.
that's odd.

12:32.898 --> 12:36.317
- justice will be served!

12:36.368 --> 12:37.785
[laughter]

12:37.820 --> 12:39.103
- oh, dear.

12:39.121 --> 12:41.372
- ladies.

12:41.407 --> 12:43.207
Moody.

12:43.242 --> 12:45.960
I demand satisfaction.

12:45.994 --> 12:49.630
- well, general sherman,
nice of you to join us.

12:49.665 --> 12:51.549
- william tecumseh sherman, no.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.885
Yet another sign
of your blazing ignorance.

12:53.919 --> 12:56.721
No, major general
george henry thomas,

12:56.755 --> 12:59.557
Rock of chickamauga.
- oh.

12:59.591 --> 13:01.092
- well, pleased to make
your acquaintance.

13:01.126 --> 13:02.793
I don't know
whether to shake your hand

13:02.811 --> 13:05.179
Or to--
your sword or--

13:05.230 --> 13:06.814
- the day of reckoning
is at hand.

13:06.849 --> 13:08.733
It's time for you to answer
for your sins.

13:08.767 --> 13:11.152
You and i will duel
on this fine day...

13:11.186 --> 13:13.154
Like men!

13:13.188 --> 13:15.356
- ah.
men of what century?

13:15.407 --> 13:17.308
- dear god,
he's completely blotto.

13:17.326 --> 13:19.160
- how can you tell?

13:19.194 --> 13:21.162
- he must have gone out drinking
with those reenactment people.

13:21.196 --> 13:23.481
- you mock me?
- guilty.

13:23.499 --> 13:25.750
- i challenge you to a duel,
and this is how you respond?

13:25.784 --> 13:27.668
- personally,
i love a good duel.

13:27.703 --> 13:29.670
[laughs]
- bates!

13:29.705 --> 13:32.507
You're back and looking good.

13:32.541 --> 13:35.659
Let's go, moody.
you've defiled my wife.

13:35.677 --> 13:37.495
You've brought dishonor
to this house,

13:37.513 --> 13:39.097
The university.

13:39.131 --> 13:40.214
I'll stand for it no more.

13:40.265 --> 13:43.334
And get your filthy car
out of my driveway.

13:43.352 --> 13:44.352
- stacy.

13:44.386 --> 13:46.020
Stacy, you might want
to rest up.

13:46.054 --> 13:47.838
Hank doesn't want to play
these games.

13:47.856 --> 13:49.056
- no, hank don't want to play.

13:49.108 --> 13:50.508
- they always lose,
you see.

13:50.526 --> 13:52.360
The union army gets defeated
at the battle of chickamauga,

13:52.394 --> 13:53.694
And then they go out drinking.

13:53.729 --> 13:55.196
- he held until nightfall,

13:55.230 --> 13:57.698
Preventing an even greater
union defeat.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.567
How?
because general thomas

13:59.618 --> 14:01.519
Refused to surrender
horseshoe ridge.

14:01.537 --> 14:03.488
Was he the flashiest
civil war general?

14:03.522 --> 14:05.323
No.

14:05.357 --> 14:07.208
Did he impress the ladies?

14:07.242 --> 14:08.326
Hmm?

14:08.360 --> 14:09.860
Was he a highly functioning
alcoholic

14:09.878 --> 14:12.213
Like ulysses s. grant?

14:12.247 --> 14:14.332
Maybe.

14:14.366 --> 14:16.501
- [chuckles]

14:16.535 --> 14:18.753
- you know, you might want
to play along with him.

14:18.804 --> 14:19.921
- what?

14:19.972 --> 14:22.423
And let him bust
civil war-era cap in my ass?

14:22.474 --> 14:23.641
I don't think so.

14:23.675 --> 14:25.176
- no, no, no, no,
they're harmless.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.011
They're--they're just blanks.
you won't feel anything.

14:27.045 --> 14:29.096
- [laughs]
yes!

14:29.148 --> 14:30.314
- general?

14:30.349 --> 14:32.266
- i'll be waiting
in the field of valor.

14:34.219 --> 14:37.321
For love and honor!

14:37.356 --> 14:38.990
- it's really quite fun.

14:39.024 --> 14:41.442
- [laughs]

14:41.493 --> 14:44.662
- we're gonna sell this house.

14:45.914 --> 14:46.948
To moving on.

14:46.999 --> 14:49.116
- and to my favorite roommate.

14:49.168 --> 14:50.501
- aw.

14:50.536 --> 14:53.204
And just think, we don't have
to be roommates anymore.

14:53.238 --> 14:55.039
You can fuck
whoever you want,

14:55.073 --> 14:56.574
However you want.
- whoo!

14:56.592 --> 14:59.544
- cowgirl, reverse cowgirl,
downward facing dog,

14:59.578 --> 15:00.795
Whatevs.

15:00.846 --> 15:02.413
- i think that's a yoga term.

15:02.431 --> 15:05.132
- it is both a sex term
and a yoga term.

15:05.184 --> 15:06.634
I learned that
from rick springfield.

15:06.685 --> 15:09.604
- please don't tell me
any more.

15:09.638 --> 15:10.805
- that's the beauty of it.

15:10.856 --> 15:13.307
I fuck who i want,
you fuck who you want,

15:13.358 --> 15:15.860
And we don't have to discuss
the details.

15:15.894 --> 15:17.311
I don't have to hear
all your shit

15:17.362 --> 15:19.647
About your pieces of class
up the ass.

15:19.698 --> 15:21.765
- you know,
not to go back on this,

15:21.783 --> 15:23.985
But you actually did
offer me the ass one time,

15:24.036 --> 15:25.987
Right here
in this very living room.

15:26.038 --> 15:27.371
- what was i thinking?

15:27.406 --> 15:28.656
Dr. drew says you could get

15:28.707 --> 15:30.608
A prolapsed anus
from that shit.

15:30.626 --> 15:31.659
- ooh.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.711
- once you hit 80,
your ass is like,

15:33.745 --> 15:35.830
"why did you have to take it
in the pooper that one time?

15:35.881 --> 15:38.499
Now you're gonna have to carry
me around with you all day."

15:38.550 --> 15:41.719
- oh, oh, oh.
and right over here, huh?

15:41.753 --> 15:43.721
The year that i got
that utk bonus, remember?

15:43.755 --> 15:46.807
I came in.
i bent you over the couch and--

15:46.842 --> 15:49.310
- and gave me the worst
back pain i've ever experienced.

15:49.344 --> 15:51.178
- ha ha!

15:51.230 --> 15:53.014
- for years, i had a man
who liked to take it

15:53.065 --> 15:55.816
Out of the comfortable bedroom,
take it on the road.

15:55.851 --> 15:58.319
Great.
- [chuckles] that's right.

15:58.353 --> 16:00.655
Wow.

16:00.689 --> 16:03.574
We really have humped
all over this house, haven't we?

16:03.609 --> 16:05.326
- remember
the kitchen-counter encounter?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.978
- best night of my life.
- not mine.

16:07.996 --> 16:11.482
Days later, i was still finding
crumbs in my folds.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.200
- what about the powder room?

16:13.252 --> 16:16.254
- we never did it there.
- that's true.

16:16.288 --> 16:17.755
There's one room in this house

16:17.789 --> 16:20.124
That was spared
our unholy alliance.

16:20.158 --> 16:21.342
Okay, let's go.

16:21.376 --> 16:23.044
Let's go, come on, come on.
- where? what?

16:23.095 --> 16:24.995
- we can't leave one room
uninitiated.

16:25.013 --> 16:26.213
- charlie, we're moving on.

16:26.265 --> 16:27.632
- we cannot leave
that room pristine,

16:27.666 --> 16:29.500
Because that would be a tragedy,
and this is a happy day.

16:29.518 --> 16:30.501
Let's go.
- what?

16:30.519 --> 16:32.002
- you move it, schoolgirl.
- no.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.337
- you--come on, let's go.
let's go.

16:33.355 --> 16:34.672
- no, you can't tell me
what to do.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.274
- daddy's coming, yah-hah!

16:36.308 --> 16:37.858
- you sure these
aren't actually loaded?

16:37.893 --> 16:39.677
- oh, just pick one, moody.

16:39.695 --> 16:41.679
- so ten paces and then turn?

16:41.697 --> 16:43.114
- i don't believe
i have ever met

16:43.148 --> 16:44.682
A bigger pussy in my life.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.734
You slept with the man's wife,
didn't you?

16:46.785 --> 16:48.619
The code of honor
demands it.

16:48.654 --> 16:50.454
- what do you know
about honor,

16:50.489 --> 16:51.956
You numb nuts?
- silence.

16:51.990 --> 16:54.024
I'll have none of that filthy
talk on this field of valor.

16:54.042 --> 16:55.793
- my bad.

16:55.827 --> 16:57.078
- this is quite fun,
chels, isn't it?

16:57.129 --> 16:58.529
Reminds me
of the good old days

16:58.547 --> 17:00.047
When we used to follow
your father around

17:00.082 --> 17:01.532
From battlefield
to battlefield.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.634
- ladies...
- shh.

17:03.669 --> 17:06.053
- come on.
- start your egos.

17:08.339 --> 17:11.040
Oh, for fuck's sake, moody,
stop fucking around.

17:11.059 --> 17:12.476
Come on!

17:12.511 --> 17:14.377
- huh!

17:14.396 --> 17:17.147
- come on,
let's do this thing.

17:17.182 --> 17:18.733
- come on.
- come on, let's go.

17:18.767 --> 17:20.434
- there, stand there.

17:20.484 --> 17:21.902
- i hope dad shoots him
right in between the eyes.

17:21.936 --> 17:23.820
- come on, moody, you're not
getting out of this one.

17:23.855 --> 17:26.857
- i'll let that slide
since this isn't a real duel.

17:26.891 --> 17:31.061
- one, two, five, six...

17:31.079 --> 17:33.030
Nine, ten.

17:33.064 --> 17:34.615
[gun clicks]
[felicia yelps]

17:34.666 --> 17:36.784
- oh, damn it to hell.

17:36.835 --> 17:38.902
Well, moody, take your shot.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.671
- wait, you want me
to shoot you?

17:40.706 --> 17:42.239
Nah, it's all right.
i'm good.

17:42.257 --> 17:44.759
[gun clicks]
ugh.

17:44.793 --> 17:46.744
- moody, i demand
that you shoot me.

17:46.762 --> 17:47.762
- oh, no can do.

17:47.796 --> 17:49.513
This whole thing
is way too gay for me.

17:49.548 --> 17:51.248
- hold on a second.
[gun clicks]

17:51.266 --> 17:54.135
You fucked the man's wife,
and now you refuse to shoot him?

17:54.186 --> 17:56.270
- you know something,
if it's all the same to you--

17:56.304 --> 17:59.390
- aaah!

18:01.893 --> 18:04.278
- is this what's supposed
to happen?

18:04.312 --> 18:05.780
- cool down, girls.

18:05.814 --> 18:07.448
- ahh.

18:07.482 --> 18:09.450
- ahh.

18:09.484 --> 18:11.202
- well, i guess
i deserved that.

18:13.155 --> 18:15.740
- i'm sorry.
i apologize.

18:15.774 --> 18:16.774
- no biggie.

18:16.792 --> 18:19.460
- no, it was ungentlemanly
of me.

18:19.494 --> 18:22.880
The purpose of a duel
is to fight with honor

18:22.914 --> 18:24.281
And decorum.

18:24.299 --> 18:26.801
- ooh.
[laughs]

18:26.835 --> 18:29.470
Nice one, dean.
that was--

18:29.504 --> 18:31.972
- oh, you liked that, huh?
- yes, i did.

18:32.007 --> 18:33.974
- well, you know something?
you offend my honor.

18:34.009 --> 18:35.793
You offend my lady's honor.

18:35.811 --> 18:36.844
- your lady?

18:36.895 --> 18:38.896
Are you so sure
she's really yours?

18:38.930 --> 18:41.465
Shit, moody, you couldn't own
a woman like that.

18:41.483 --> 18:43.567
Christ,
i still remember the sound

18:43.602 --> 18:45.486
Of her approaching climax--

18:45.520 --> 18:47.805
Fucking choir of angels.

18:47.823 --> 18:50.191
- ooh!

18:50.242 --> 18:53.160
[all grunting]

18:53.195 --> 18:54.812
- that's my ass!

18:54.830 --> 18:58.482
- i can't tell
if they're joking or not.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.785
- [shouting indistinctly]

19:00.819 --> 19:02.152
Got him!

19:02.170 --> 19:04.505
- oh, god, i think
they're actually fighting.

19:04.539 --> 19:06.490
- can i take you up
on that drink?

19:06.508 --> 19:07.491
[laughs]

19:07.509 --> 19:09.210
- [laughing]

19:09.261 --> 19:12.930
- [moaning]
- [growling]

19:12.964 --> 19:14.799
- fuck your pussy.
fuck your pussy.

19:14.833 --> 19:15.883
- fuck my pussy?

19:15.934 --> 19:17.885
Or your pussy
is my pussy, or--

19:17.936 --> 19:20.104
- shut up and pound me.
- okay.

19:20.138 --> 19:23.691
[both grunting]

19:23.725 --> 19:24.775
[loud crash]

19:24.810 --> 19:27.144
- oh, shit!
ow! oh, my back.

19:27.178 --> 19:29.847
Oh!
- holy mother of fuck!

19:29.865 --> 19:31.699
- ow.
help, help.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.350
- why did i let you
sit on the sink?

19:33.368 --> 19:35.152
The chick is supposed
to sit on the sink.

19:35.186 --> 19:37.187
That's bathroom boning 101!

19:37.205 --> 19:39.240
- i can't move,
i'm fucking drowning here.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.208
- you're drowning, really?

19:41.243 --> 19:42.710
- yeah, a person can drown
in this amount of water

19:42.744 --> 19:43.878
In certain circumstances.

19:43.912 --> 19:46.464
- oh, god.
- oh, ow!

19:46.498 --> 19:48.749
Ow!
- okay, you big baby.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.885
- okay.
ow, oh!

19:50.919 --> 19:52.136
- get over here.
- oh.

19:52.170 --> 19:53.637
Okay.

19:53.672 --> 19:56.173
Okay, climbing
the toilet bowl.

19:56.207 --> 19:57.541
- oh, fuck.

19:57.559 --> 20:00.644
- we're almost home.
- sit, sit.

20:00.679 --> 20:02.346
- [groaning]

20:02.380 --> 20:03.380
- wait.

20:03.398 --> 20:05.850
What the fuck is that?

20:05.884 --> 20:08.519
You had my name tattooed
above your ass crack?

20:08.553 --> 20:09.854
- oh, jesus, i was drunk.

20:09.888 --> 20:11.772
I don't even remember
getting it done.

20:11.823 --> 20:12.940
- [gasps]
charlie.

20:12.991 --> 20:14.742
- what?
i'm getting it removed. i am.

20:14.776 --> 20:17.244
- no, you're not.
- what?

20:17.279 --> 20:18.612
You like it?

20:18.663 --> 20:20.781
- no, i don't like it.
it's fucking retarded.

20:20.832 --> 20:22.032
- ow.

20:22.066 --> 20:24.702
- retarded and sweet...

20:24.736 --> 20:26.203
Just like you, runkle.

20:26.237 --> 20:28.506
- ow. ow.

20:28.540 --> 20:31.074
Ow.

20:31.092 --> 20:35.078
- i guess i'd better take
my walking wounded home, right?

20:35.096 --> 20:38.432
That's if he ever
comes out of the bathroom.

20:38.466 --> 20:40.050
Are you--are you okay

20:40.084 --> 20:42.186
With, uh, becca
spending the night?

20:42.220 --> 20:43.220
- oh, yeah.

20:43.254 --> 20:44.722
Yeah, of course.
it's no problem.

20:44.756 --> 20:45.890
You know, it's nice
for the girls

20:45.924 --> 20:48.142
To spend
one last sleepover together

20:48.193 --> 20:50.144
Before becca leaves
for new york.

20:50.195 --> 20:51.195
- right.

20:51.229 --> 20:52.730
- good luck with that,
by the way.

20:52.764 --> 20:54.648
- thank you.

20:54.699 --> 20:55.933
[toilet flushing]

20:55.951 --> 20:57.535
Are you always so civilized?

20:57.569 --> 20:59.203
- [laughs]

20:59.237 --> 21:00.371
Well, the wife of a general

21:00.405 --> 21:02.156
Has certain responsibilities,
you know?

21:02.207 --> 21:03.941
- of course.
- uh-huh.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.160
- well...

21:06.211 --> 21:08.829
I'll never be
as pretty as i once was.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.164
And i'm peeing blood.

21:10.215 --> 21:12.716
- i got myself
more of a foot soldier--

21:12.751 --> 21:15.636
Some cannon fodder,
really.

21:15.670 --> 21:18.172
- what did i miss?

21:18.223 --> 21:19.957
- [laughs]
- what did i miss?

21:19.975 --> 21:23.344
- ah, look at that.

21:23.395 --> 21:27.681
One semester ends,
another begins.

21:27.732 --> 21:30.017
- you gonna do something
about that?

21:30.068 --> 21:31.852
- what's the point,
you know?

21:31.903 --> 21:33.520
Nothing ever really changes
around here.

21:33.572 --> 21:35.305
That's the beautiful thing
about academia.

21:35.323 --> 21:37.992
None of us can really function
in the real world,

21:38.026 --> 21:39.743
So that's why we end up here.

21:39.778 --> 21:41.412
It sort of works
for everyone, really.

21:41.446 --> 21:42.613
- mm-hmm.

21:42.647 --> 21:44.949
- we can't function
anywhere else but here.

21:44.983 --> 21:46.867
- [imitating felicia]
hmm. you can't.

21:46.918 --> 21:48.669
No, you can't.
- ignore him.

21:48.703 --> 21:50.537
- what's he saying?

21:50.589 --> 21:53.374
- okay, i'm gonna go say
good night to richard.

21:53.425 --> 21:55.542
- no, you can't.

21:55.594 --> 21:57.044
[normal voice]
go. i'm timing you.

21:57.095 --> 21:58.879
- thank you for lunch.

21:58.930 --> 22:00.497
- well, i hope
we didn't give you

22:00.515 --> 22:01.882
Too hard a time of it today.

22:01.933 --> 22:03.834
- no, no worries.
i'm fine.

22:03.852 --> 22:06.837
My ass is a little sore,
but that's normal for me.

22:06.855 --> 22:08.555
- it's all done
with great affection.

22:08.607 --> 22:10.507
You know, you're such a mess,
and you cause such chaos,

22:10.525 --> 22:12.009
But i wouldn't change anything.

22:12.027 --> 22:13.777
- you sure about that?
- really, truly.

22:13.812 --> 22:16.847
It was a fabulous disaster.
- hmm.

22:16.865 --> 22:18.515
- come here.
be happy in new york.

22:18.533 --> 22:19.683
- oh, there you go.

22:19.701 --> 22:20.734
What about general sherman?

22:20.785 --> 22:21.869
You gonna let him
back in the house?

22:21.903 --> 22:23.070
'cause if you don't,

22:23.121 --> 22:24.688
I think he's gonna call in
reinforcements--

22:24.706 --> 22:25.956
The cavalry, perhaps.

22:25.991 --> 22:27.524
- mm, he does seem
very determined.

22:27.542 --> 22:28.525
- yeah.

22:28.543 --> 22:30.527
Passionate, one might say.

22:30.545 --> 22:33.030
- oh, i do like that
in a man.

22:33.048 --> 22:35.866
- felicia, i'm in a fever!

22:35.884 --> 22:37.868
- i better go tend
to the general.

22:37.886 --> 22:39.369
Toodle-loo.
- toodle-loo.

22:39.387 --> 22:41.705
- my brow!

22:43.425 --> 22:45.042
- did you ladies have fun

22:45.060 --> 22:46.877
Twisting the knife
this afternoon?

22:46.895 --> 22:49.379
- absolutely.
- too much fun.

22:49.397 --> 22:52.215
- well, i'm so happy
that i could give you a reason

22:52.233 --> 22:55.052
To come together
and become friends.

22:55.070 --> 22:56.720
- yeah, we're like bffs now.

22:56.738 --> 22:58.388
She's gonna teach me
how to pole-dance.

22:58.406 --> 23:00.658
- mm, such
a crying shame, hank.

23:00.692 --> 23:03.827
Just think of all
of the missed opportunities.

23:03.862 --> 23:04.995
- ow...

23:05.030 --> 23:06.497
[both laugh]

23:06.531 --> 23:09.750
Mm-hmm.
- moody...

23:09.784 --> 23:11.835
If i hear you've gone
and blown it

23:11.870 --> 23:13.504
With this gorgeous filly,

23:13.538 --> 23:17.091
I will kick your ass
and make her my queen.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.842
Ladies.
- yes.

23:18.877 --> 23:21.962
- take care, karen.
- bye, have fun.

23:22.013 --> 23:23.580
- bye.

23:23.598 --> 23:26.016
- i can't believe
i used to love that guy.

23:26.051 --> 23:27.685
- you'll get over it.

23:27.719 --> 23:29.937
Come on, soldier,
let's get you home.

23:29.971 --> 23:33.524
You still have battles to fight,
realms to conquer.

23:33.558 --> 23:36.527
- the child--
what about the child?

23:36.561 --> 23:39.897
- the child
is staying here tonight.

23:45.070 --> 23:47.037
- oh.

23:47.072 --> 23:48.989
Oh, wow.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.208
No wonder we never did it
in the powder room, huh?

23:51.242 --> 23:53.711
That was--that was really not
pleasant at all.

23:53.745 --> 23:56.130
- it wasn't great.

23:56.164 --> 23:58.281
- i don't mean the first part,
of course.

23:58.299 --> 23:59.550
I meant the second part.

23:59.584 --> 24:01.468
I enjoyed the shit
out of humping you at first.

24:01.503 --> 24:02.803
- yeah, well, we could sleep

24:02.837 --> 24:04.304
Knowing we gave
the next homeowners

24:04.339 --> 24:06.473
A dirty sink
and a plumbing problem.

24:06.508 --> 24:08.892
[both mimicking laughter]

24:11.312 --> 24:13.463
Holy shit.
- mm?

24:13.481 --> 24:14.648
- they came--

24:14.682 --> 24:17.484
The divorce papers.

24:17.519 --> 24:21.155
- whoa.

24:21.189 --> 24:24.408
- big day, charlie--
signing time.

24:24.442 --> 24:26.360
- well, i-i can't move.

24:26.411 --> 24:28.112
You're gonna have
to bring me a pen.

24:30.031 --> 24:33.117
- [sighs]

24:33.151 --> 24:35.002
[clears throat]

24:36.871 --> 24:39.590
- hey, how was the first part
for you, marce, hmm?

24:39.624 --> 24:40.841
You never said.

24:40.875 --> 24:43.010
- well, what do you
want me to say, charlie?

24:43.044 --> 24:45.345
The first part with you
was great.

24:45.380 --> 24:47.881
It's the last part
that ended in disaster.

24:47.932 --> 24:50.884
- yeah, yeah, but it
doesn't have to, you know?

24:50.935 --> 24:54.188
Because we
could keep going, right?

24:54.222 --> 24:57.191
You know,
we--we turn the last part

24:57.225 --> 24:58.559
Into the middle part.

24:58.610 --> 25:01.779
- and what happens when we get
to the next shitty part?

25:01.813 --> 25:04.364
- there doesn't have to be
a shitty part.

25:04.399 --> 25:06.984
- baby...

25:07.018 --> 25:10.654
There's always
a shitty part with us.

25:16.911 --> 25:19.863
- [grunting]
ow.

25:21.866 --> 25:22.916
Hey.

25:36.547 --> 25:40.217
- [sniffles]

25:42.220 --> 25:44.855
- i appreciate the interest,
i really do.

25:44.889 --> 25:46.940
- you do?
- yes, i'm just--

25:46.991 --> 25:48.892
I'm just not sure

25:48.910 --> 25:52.196
I'm in the moody.

25:52.230 --> 25:53.697
- oh, no.

25:53.731 --> 25:56.399
But i am.
i--i really am.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.035
I mean,
today was so exciting.

25:58.069 --> 26:00.120
I could, like,
totally just, like,

26:00.171 --> 26:02.623
Carry on from where
we left off this morning.

26:02.674 --> 26:05.425
My mind and my body
are totally in sync.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.127
- i'm not sure

26:07.178 --> 26:09.630
That i like the implication
of that.

26:09.681 --> 26:13.467
- what? it's very sexy for a man
to fight for your honor.

26:13.518 --> 26:14.635
- is it also very sexy

26:14.686 --> 26:16.303
To run into some old geezer
you let bone you

26:16.354 --> 26:17.604
When you were 19 years old?

26:17.639 --> 26:18.972
- well, you know,
it just reminded me

26:19.023 --> 26:20.440
Of being back at college again,

26:20.475 --> 26:23.260
When life was so simple,
and he was so--

26:23.278 --> 26:26.396
- he was so passionate,
so full of enthusiasm.

26:26.430 --> 26:28.315
I know, i know.

26:28.366 --> 26:30.433
- he was so big, actually.

26:30.451 --> 26:32.319
- oh, gross.

26:32.370 --> 26:35.822
- i mean, not that that matters
or anything, but, um...

26:35.874 --> 26:37.908
Well, you know, right?
you saw.

26:37.942 --> 26:39.159
- i saw nothing.
- the whole deal.

26:39.210 --> 26:41.778
- as far as i know,
the man is a hermaphrodite.

26:41.796 --> 26:43.664
- really?
god, he was--

26:43.715 --> 26:46.500
He was, like, the hottest
assistant professor

26:46.551 --> 26:47.834
On the campus.

26:47.886 --> 26:49.753
Everybody wanted
to sleep with him.

26:49.787 --> 26:50.888
My friends were so jealous.

26:50.922 --> 26:53.173
One time we were doing it
in his office,

26:53.224 --> 26:55.509
And there was, like,
this line down the hall--

26:55.560 --> 26:56.727
- okay, that's it.

26:56.761 --> 27:00.463
I demand satisfaction.
- yes, yes, it worked!

27:00.481 --> 27:03.300
Good. mm.
are you gonna punish me?

27:03.318 --> 27:04.651
- you do know
i'm gonna have to live

27:04.686 --> 27:06.570
With that image in my head
for the rest of my life.

27:06.604 --> 27:08.071
- i know.

27:10.992 --> 27:12.976
- i'm just not sure
that my mind and my body

27:12.994 --> 27:14.978
Are in sync either.

27:14.996 --> 27:16.813
You know,
the--the events of the day,

27:16.831 --> 27:19.482
All this fun you've had,
it's bruised my mind.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.817
It's traumatized me.

27:20.835 --> 27:24.321
It may very well undermine
my ability to please you.

27:24.339 --> 27:26.089
- really?

27:26.124 --> 27:28.959
- no, not really.
