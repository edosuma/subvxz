Officer.
Officer. Help.

00:35.968 --> 00:37.000
Officer!

00:40.473 --> 00:42.272
Some kook melted the ice rink.

00:42.274 --> 00:45.242
With a flame thrower, yet!

01:30.890 --> 01:32.022
Ice?

01:32.024 --> 01:33.991
In July?

01:34.193 --> 01:36.860
But who would melt down
an ice rink

01:36.862 --> 01:41.165
and then turn right around
ice up a street and..

01:43.869 --> 01:44.935
You don't mean..

01:44.937 --> 01:47.004
That diabolical snow man.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.906
Who can only exists
in temperatures

01:48.908 --> 01:50.974
50 degrees below zero or more.

01:50.976 --> 01:51.441
Oh, no!

01:51.443 --> 01:55.145
Man with a heart of ice
and a cold calculating brain

01:55.147 --> 01:57.281
of the master criminal.

01:58.517 --> 02:02.219
There only one man
in this entire city capable

02:02.221 --> 02:04.188
of defrosting Mr. Freeze.

02:07.226 --> 02:09.126
Agreed?

02:30.015 --> 02:32.049
I'll call him, sir.

02:34.053 --> 02:34.518
Wow!

02:35.020 --> 02:36.720
All you do
is rough up the cover

02:36.722 --> 02:40.590
get a good grip on the seams,
get that pitching arm--

02:40.592 --> 02:41.958
Careful, the vase.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.360
- Ah.
- Pow!

02:43.362 --> 02:46.363
- What part I hit?
- You're out.

02:46.365 --> 02:50.500
That's the way you do it. The
old Diamante fast ball special.

02:50.502 --> 02:51.368
Shades of Sandy Koufax!

02:51.370 --> 02:53.002
No wonder they call you
the Great Diamante.

02:53.004 --> 02:56.005
You must be about the best
pitcher in the world.

02:56.007 --> 02:58.908
About? Yes.
Just ask him.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.478
I'd like to say it's not only
been a pleasure

03:01.480 --> 03:03.780
but an education to have
the three most illustrious

03:03.782 --> 03:06.649
members of the Gotham City
Eagles here for lunch.

03:06.651 --> 03:09.953
- Do I hear a second?
- Second the motion.

03:09.955 --> 03:11.855
- Third.
- Here, here.

03:11.857 --> 03:16.826
- I hope you liked my cherry..
- The Bat-phone, sir.

03:16.828 --> 03:20.630
Thank you, Alfred. I didn't
realize it was that late.

03:20.632 --> 03:24.067
Seems I have an impatient
date waiting, gentlemen.

03:24.069 --> 03:26.770
Well, what're you waiting for?

03:26.772 --> 03:28.705
Hard to keep
the young lady waiting?

03:28.707 --> 03:30.540
Or the ladies younger sister.

03:30.542 --> 03:32.475
But is any young
teenage miss worth

03:32.477 --> 03:34.010
pitching lesson
from the Great Diamante?

03:34.012 --> 03:37.013
We were leaving anyway. Thanks
it was a wonderful dinner.

03:37.015 --> 03:39.649
- The meal was terrific.
- Thank you, boys.

03:39.651 --> 03:42.452
Thank you so much.
Come again, won't you?

03:46.125 --> 03:47.090
Yes, commissioner.

03:47.092 --> 03:50.928
Chilling news.
It's Mr. Freeze.

Poor devil.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.310
Forced to live in
an air condition suit

05:46.612 --> 05:52.583
that keeps his body temperature
down to 50 degrees below zero.

05:52.585 --> 05:53.751
No wonder his mind is warped.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.754
Your pity is all well, Batman.
But what's he up too?

05:56.756 --> 05:59.123
Yes. What is the point
of his shenanigans?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.058
I see calling cards,
Chief O'Hara.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.861
To let me know he's back
in Gotham City.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.963
Of course, he wants revenge.

06:05.965 --> 06:09.199
- I'm not so sure I blame him.
- It was an accident, Batman.

06:09.201 --> 06:12.970
You didn't mean to knock that
beaker of instant freeze on him

06:12.972 --> 06:14.739
during a fight
in his laboratory.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.041
The Boy Wonder is right.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.542
He was the culprit, Batman.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.777
Experimenting
with those devilish

06:19.779 --> 06:21.579
instant freeze solutions
and for some

06:21.581 --> 06:23.147
criminal purpose, undoubtedly.

06:23.149 --> 06:23.948
True, commissioner.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.884
Nevertheless I feel it's my duty
not only to catch him

06:26.886 --> 06:29.153
but with all the medical
know how at our command

06:29.155 --> 06:33.491
to help that sorry creature
back to a normal way of life.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.426
Noble sentiments, Batman.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.795
Wasted on
the fiendish likes of him.

06:37.797 --> 06:40.765
Perhaps, men.
We'll soon see.

06:40.767 --> 06:44.735
But with his revenge,
he just may want a dividend.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.437
- A dividend?
- Money.

06:46.439 --> 06:50.174
Maintaining his sub zero
environment is expensive.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.475
Holy iceberg!

06:51.477 --> 06:53.077
We can expect a crime wave.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.746
No, Robin.
A cold wave.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.581
- Of terror.
- How?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.016
Where will he strike first?

06:59.018 --> 07:01.819
That's for him to plot
and us to guess.

07:01.821 --> 07:05.022
We'll use our anti-crime
computer in the Bat-cave.

07:05.024 --> 07:05.723
Right, Robin.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.958
If there're any new strange
occurrences, commissioner

07:07.960 --> 07:09.994
call us immediately
on the hotline.

07:09.996 --> 07:13.030
To the Batmobile.
Let's go.

07:16.601 --> 07:21.338

Revenge! Revenge!

07:33.018 --> 07:36.320
I will pin Batman's hide
to the walls of City Hall

07:36.322 --> 07:39.190
after I have made him the
laughing stock of Gotham City.

07:41.694 --> 07:42.693
Oh!

07:43.195 --> 07:46.363
Well, Kolevator, what're
you waiting for Christmas?

07:46.365 --> 07:49.099
You forgot to turn on
my hot path, sir.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.503
I forgot
that you have not the same

07:53.505 --> 07:55.605
reverse metabolism
as I have.

07:55.607 --> 07:59.109

76 degree temperature

07:59.111 --> 08:01.244

08:02.248 --> 08:03.814

08:03.816 --> 08:07.217
Nippy, have you ordered
the airplane

08:07.219 --> 08:08.886
to go zoom, zoom, zoom?

08:08.888 --> 08:09.653
Yeah, boss.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.623
<i> Und</i> Chill, how many Batman's
have you hired

08:12.625 --> 08:13.290
for this afternoon?

08:13.292 --> 08:17.027
- Five, boss.
-<i> Und</i> Mo, how many of me?

08:17.029 --> 08:18.929
And five of youse naturally.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.298
Five Batman's,
five of me.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.169
This is the beginning
of the end of Batman's.

08:26.305 --> 08:31.141
Nippy, give my order
to unleash the decoys.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.275
Right, boss.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.751
I will toy with him
like cat with mouse.

08:40.753 --> 08:44.955
I will lure him right
to the scene of the crime.

08:44.957 --> 08:49.126
First I toy,
then I destroy.

08:50.496 --> 08:54.498
<i> In the Bat-cave far below</i>
<i> Stately Wayne Manor</i>

08:54.500 --> 08:59.169
<i> Batman and the Boy Wonder</i>
<i> make plans for their meeting</i>

08:59.171 --> 09:00.770
<i> with their frosty foe.</i>

09:00.772 --> 09:05.775
'Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six'

09:05.777 --> 09:13.383
'five, four, three,
two, one, zero.'

09:16.756 --> 09:18.688
Zero is maximum.

09:18.690 --> 09:22.560
Failed again. The anti-freeze
capsule, won't do the job.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.228
Iced tea, sir.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.195
Holy blizzard!

09:25.197 --> 09:27.998
Who needs iced tea
at a time like this, Alfred?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.501
Hot tea might be more
appropriate, Alfred.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.035
Under the circumstances.

09:32.037 --> 09:34.805
I anticipated
the circumstances, sir.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.507
Piping hot.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.409
- Anticipated?
- Yes, sir. From the newspaper.

09:39.411 --> 09:44.381
A rather strange little column
concerning melted ice rinks

09:44.383 --> 09:46.550
and bursting ice dispensers.

09:46.552 --> 09:50.154
Might lead one to suppose
that Mr. Freeze

09:50.156 --> 09:51.054
was back in town again.

09:51.056 --> 09:53.023
- He's back, alright.
- Unfortunately.

09:53.025 --> 09:56.126
- Seeking revenge.
- Oh, dear, dear me.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.795
How very distressing.

09:57.797 --> 10:00.531
And this...this freezing
chamber contraption

10:00.533 --> 10:02.966
if I might be so bold
as to enquire, sir.

10:02.968 --> 10:06.904
Would that be some sort of
defense against, Mr. Freeze?

10:06.906 --> 10:09.173
Not that. This.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.542
This new anti-freeze capsule.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.244
Taken internally
and enables the person

10:14.246 --> 10:16.246
to withstand intense cold.

10:16.248 --> 10:19.082
But we're using the freezing
chamber to test the results.

10:19.084 --> 10:20.818
If I understand you
correctly, sir.

10:20.820 --> 10:24.154
- It tested down to..
- Zero.

10:24.156 --> 10:25.289
Not cold enough, sir?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.523
To be affective against
Mr. Freeze

10:26.525 --> 10:31.094
we must withstand 50 degrees
below zero temperatures.

10:31.096 --> 10:34.198
If we're forced to meet him
on his own ground.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.600
I'm sure we're in for
a mighty chilly reception.

10:36.602 --> 10:40.204
Do you think
it might come to that, sir?

10:40.206 --> 10:41.205
Who knows.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.474
All we can assume
is that somewhere, somehow

10:44.476 --> 10:48.846
his evil scheme
for revenge is in operation..

10:49.348 --> 10:50.881
...right now.

10:58.759 --> 11:02.594
But how can Batman be
in six places at once?

11:02.596 --> 11:03.128
Impossible.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.963
oh, Look at these
patrol car reports.

11:05.465 --> 11:09.667
He's been spotted uptown,
downtown, east side, west side.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.971
And every officer wants to know,
what's the trouble?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.340
What's Batman doing
in my territory?

11:15.342 --> 11:18.743
Impossible.
They're imposters of course.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.647
We must notify Batman.

11:35.028 --> 11:35.860
Yes, commissioner.

11:35.862 --> 11:40.431
You asked me to report
any strange occurrences.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.134
I think this one qualifies.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.437
Now, that's the last location
where a patrol car spotted me?

11:46.439 --> 11:50.408
'You were seen there
less than two minutes ago.'

11:50.410 --> 11:51.876
Wait a minute.
Hold on. Hold..

11:51.878 --> 11:55.547
"Batman last reported
at 59th street, now at 57th."

11:55.549 --> 11:58.983
- That about wraps it up.
- I'll be in touch.

11:58.985 --> 12:02.086
Move me in
from 59th street to 57th.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.824
Holy schizophrenia!

12:05.826 --> 12:08.493
If you're all these places
at the same time..

12:08.495 --> 12:11.296
You sure are spreading yourself
pretty thin.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.163
Notice the pattern.

12:12.165 --> 12:16.301
They all seem to be moving
in to the center.

12:16.536 --> 12:20.839
44th between 5th and 6th.

12:21.007 --> 12:21.906
Leapin' Lumbago!

12:21.908 --> 12:25.009
- The diamond exchange.
- The diamond..

12:25.011 --> 12:26.244
But of course.
Diamonds.

12:26.246 --> 12:30.081
In the vernacular
of the underworld <i> ice!</i>

12:30.083 --> 12:31.049
Let's go!

13:09.256 --> 13:12.323
Very nice. Thank you.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.562
Now, the famous Star Of Kashmir
diamond, if you please.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.331
Oh, dear me no.
Not the Star Of Kashmir.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.602
- The star. Immediately.
- Well, I-I..

13:34.381 --> 13:37.515
It's in the safe. There.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.350
But I don't know
the combination.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.020
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.489
Who needs combination?

14:03.143 --> 14:06.978
Drop 'em.
Who needs chicken feed.

14:10.216 --> 14:13.017
Ah! Look at that.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.621
The most
valuable diamond in the world.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.289
The second.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.664
<i> Nein! Nein!</i>

14:26.666 --> 14:28.366
No guns.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.708
How many times must I tell you,
no ordinary guns.

14:36.710 --> 14:40.445
I want they should be
frozen stiff.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.749
Mr. Perkins.
Mr. Perkins.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.319
- Look. It's Batman.
- Oh, dear.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.367
Like one big happy family, eh?

15:21.755 --> 15:24.188
Hey, the real Batman.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.028
Follow me.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.547
It's the real me, chum.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.554
<i> Nein. Nein.</i>

16:30.790 --> 16:33.591
Batman, look.
Mr. Freeze.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.719
Holy snowball!

17:01.721 --> 17:03.822
The turbines they're iced.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.857
We're frozen out.

17:09.563 --> 17:11.162
Batman. Look.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.819
Pow, if only
I could've landed

17:33.821 --> 17:36.121
one punch
on the real Mr. Freeze.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.389
Think positive, Robin.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.124
Our computer
should clue us in

17:39.126 --> 17:42.094
on where he's liable
to strike next.

17:46.433 --> 17:51.103
Jewelry shops?
Why didn't I think of that?

17:51.105 --> 17:52.671
One thing we know for sure.

17:52.673 --> 17:56.141
Mr. Freeze is out to steal
all the ice in Gotham City.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.710
On the contrary,
one thing we know for sure is

17:58.712 --> 18:02.948
that he's not out to steal
all the ice in Gotham City.

18:02.950 --> 18:06.151
Otherwise why would he leave
a fortune in lose diamonds

18:06.153 --> 18:09.421
on the floor
of the diamond exchange.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.623
Yeah! Yeah!

18:11.625 --> 18:15.694
Assuming he doesn't want
all the ice.

18:15.696 --> 18:17.596
Perhaps he does want the best.

18:17.598 --> 18:21.466
These cards indicate the most
expensive diamonds in the world

18:21.468 --> 18:22.634
and where they're located.

18:22.636 --> 18:25.470
Circle the locations on the map.

18:28.809 --> 18:31.743
"Marie Antoinette Tiara
Trieste Jeweler

18:31.745 --> 18:33.612
"52nd and Avenue, Peace.

18:33.614 --> 18:37.449
'"Devil's Teardrop,
Maurice Leroux Export.'

18:37.451 --> 18:40.018
"Ghiaccio Circulo."

18:40.020 --> 18:43.989
The most valuable diamond
in the world.

18:43.991 --> 18:45.557
But that's not in Gotham City.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.925
It's owned by
Princess Sandra

18:46.927 --> 18:49.594
of the principality of Molino.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.696
That's it.

18:51.698 --> 18:52.864
"The Ghiaccio Circulo."

18:52.866 --> 18:55.700
English translation,
"Ice circle."

18:55.702 --> 18:57.536
- I'm studying Italian.
- Excellent.

18:57.538 --> 19:00.539
- Circle for zero.
- Zero temperature.

19:00.541 --> 19:01.506
Owned by the Princess Sandra.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.776
- Who's flying to Gotham City.
- For the charity baseball game.

19:04.778 --> 19:08.113
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Tonight.

19:08.115 --> 19:09.614
But the game's tomorrow.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.351
But she's arriving tonight.

19:22.963 --> 19:27.465
<i> Meanwhile in the royal suite</i>
<i> of the Gotham City Hotel.</i>

19:27.467 --> 19:32.737
<i> Princess Sandra, formerly</i>
<i> Sandra Carlson from Brooklyn</i>

19:32.739 --> 19:34.506
<i> tends her social affairs.</i>

19:34.508 --> 19:38.409
<i> Unaware of</i>
<i> an impending surprise.</i>

19:38.411 --> 19:41.513
Call the ambassador and tell him
that I'll be over to receive him

19:41.515 --> 19:46.284
on Thursday at 2 p.m. and make
sure you talk to his wife.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.521
Freshly cut flowers
for the dining room.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.090
Thank you, Gabriel.

19:51.092 --> 19:54.292
And I'm expecting 30 people.

19:55.697 --> 19:57.163
What is it?

20:00.468 --> 20:05.771
'For your Royal Highness,
from Molino by air.'

20:07.408 --> 20:11.477
Oh, how delightful. I wonder
what cut of beef this is?

20:13.247 --> 20:16.448
- It's cold cuts.
- The alarm.

20:29.363 --> 20:30.195
Yes, commissioner.

20:30.197 --> 20:32.498
The royal suite...we're getting
a continuous signal

20:32.500 --> 20:36.035
from that special alarm system
that you told us to install.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.503
Good.

20:37.805 --> 20:40.172
It's working, Batman.

20:41.008 --> 20:44.610
Gotham City Hotel.

21:08.469 --> 21:13.572
Stop. Nobody move
or they get frozen stiff too.

21:13.574 --> 21:18.377
Well, now, Ghiaccio Circulo,
if you please.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.213
The diamond, now.

21:37.631 --> 21:40.265
Wait. Let's take a short cut.

21:40.267 --> 21:43.969
Right. They could have
look outs in the lobby.

21:58.919 --> 21:59.918
No. No.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.854
Nobody says no to me, never.

22:03.591 --> 22:05.591
<i> Wunderbar. Wunderbar.</i>

22:05.593 --> 22:10.662
Tell Batman when he arrives,
if he arrives, what happened.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.834
Tell him yourself,
Dr. Schimmell.

22:15.836 --> 22:18.570
Alias, Mr. Freeze.

22:34.988 --> 22:39.824
No, Robin, the safety
of the hotel guest first.

22:54.341 --> 22:57.809
Fire under control.
After them, Robin.

22:57.811 --> 23:00.011
Sorry about this, Your Highness.

23:11.658 --> 23:14.659
<i> Nein. Nein. Nein.</i> Stop.

23:16.363 --> 23:20.932
I don't want to kill you.
Not yet. Not yet.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.668
Not yet.

23:37.384 --> 23:42.120
I'm sorry, Batman. I wanted to
toy with you a little longer.

23:42.122 --> 23:47.092
But that is the way
the ice cube crumbles.

23:55.536 --> 23:58.437
<i> Has Batman struck out?</i>

23:59.173 --> 24:02.741
<i> Is Robin cool, for good?</i>

24:03.344 --> 24:09.448
<i> Can no one save our</i>
<i> noble pair of human popsicles?</i>

24:12.186 --> 24:13.919
<i> Answers tomorrow night!</i>

24:13.921 --> 24:18.323
<i> Same time, same channel.</i>

24:18.692 --> 24:20.691
<i> One word of warning.</i>

24:20.693 --> 24:25.531
<i> By watching you too,</i>
<i> can lose your cool!</i>
