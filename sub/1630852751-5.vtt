00:15.140 --> 00:18.268
<i>For Terry, every day</i>
<i>means a new murder case,</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.771
<i>and a new celebrity guest star</i>
<i>as his partner.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:26.484
<i>Today's guest:</i>
<i>Hollywood icon Sharon Stone.</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:28.653
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.822
<i>Sharon isn't being given a script.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:33.825
<i>She has no idea what's about to happen.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:38.872
<i>Together, she and Terry will have</i>
<i>to improvise their way through the case.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:42.083
<i>But it'll be up to Sharon alone</i>
<i>to name the killer.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.087
<i>So join them</i>
<i>as they punch a one-way ticket</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.631
<i>to Murderville.</i>

00:55.180 --> 00:57.390
<i>Life is all about</i>
<i>self-improvement.</i>

00:57.474 --> 01:00.101
<i>If you're not getting better,</i>
<i>you are getting dead-er.</i>

01:00.185 --> 01:01.978
<i>And I'm not dead-er yet.</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:05.607
<i>Old Terry Seattle still has</i>
<i>a few tricks up his sleeve.</i>

01:05.690 --> 01:06.566
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

01:06.649 --> 01:09.235
- All right.
- It's a really nice tie.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.820
I've never seen you wear it before.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.199
Chief.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.159
Detective Phillips.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.579
Come on. Call me Daz, Terry.
I told you everyone calls me Daz.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.999
Not everyone. You should hear
some of the names you're called.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.626
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:24.709 --> 01:27.003
Uh… Ugly Bones,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.672
Doo-Doo Brains, Scrot-Lips,

01:30.381 --> 01:31.132
Fart Chopper.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.133
What are those boxes?

01:32.717 --> 01:35.595
I have been hand selected
for a very lucrative business opportunity.

01:35.678 --> 01:38.598
Yeah, selling
a revolutionary health shake:

01:38.681 --> 01:42.393
Science Living Ultimate Dietary Gold,
a.k.a. SLUDG.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.813
My neighbor got involved
in one of those companies.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.689
It's one of those
multi-level marketing scams.

01:46.773 --> 01:51.402
Not a scam. No, all I got to do to make my
investment back is make $10,000 in sales,

01:51.486 --> 01:54.948
recruit ten people to work under me,
and do each one of those things 10 times.

01:55.031 --> 01:59.160
Terry, you're in a pyramid scheme.
How could you be so gullible?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.870
Look, I'll help you out, man.
How much is a box?

02:00.954 --> 02:03.832
No way.
Wouldn't work for your body, anyway.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.250
It's made for
a natural athlete like myself.

02:05.834 --> 02:06.960
Just trying to be nice.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.130
Uh-oh. Here comes Fart Chopper.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.924
Well, your business opportunity
will have to wait.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.592
It's time for you to meet
your new partner.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.262
New partner? Come on, Chief. I'm already
partnered with a supplement company

02:17.345 --> 02:19.931
that's helping me grow
as a business and a person.

02:20.014 --> 02:23.351
Detective, meet Sharon Stone.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.020
Sharon, this is Senior Detective,
Terry Seattle.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.147
Well, hello there.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.439
Well, hello.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.109
Let me ask you something.
Do your arms work?

02:31.734 --> 02:32.610
Sometimes.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.571
- Hold these.
- No, thank you.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.489
Chief, order her to hold these.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.824
I'm not going to do that.

02:39.492 --> 02:43.329
This is not off to a great start, trainee.
All right, follow me.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.291
- Well, okay.
- You're about to learn two careers.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.752
Let's go, Sharon Stone,
if that's even your real name.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.174
I'm just going to toss these
on the rest of the inventory.

02:56.426 --> 03:00.555
Actually, you should never toss SLUDG.
It's very unstable when it's shaken.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.309
You can pop a seat there.
Sorry about those. I just--

03:04.392 --> 03:06.352
I was in the newspaper last week.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.981
Thank you. First time,
so I bought a bunch of copies.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.524
Kind of a big deal.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.527
They accidentally used my photo
with an obituary.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.863
And yet you're very much alive.

03:16.946 --> 03:20.450
So tell me, why do you want
to become a homicide detective?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.327
I really like crime.

03:23.244 --> 03:26.080
- What's your favorite part?
- I like the mystery of crime.

03:26.164 --> 03:30.335
I like to understand
why people do these weird, bad things.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.254
For me, it's about getting
into an emotional state.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.464
Like, for instance, right now.

03:34.547 --> 03:35.548
Right.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.344
I'm going to cry.
Okay, you get into an emotional state.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.393
- Excuse me, Detective.
- Yes?

03:47.477 --> 03:48.603
Why are we crying now?

03:48.686 --> 03:52.649
Sometimes you need to cry for families
and you make them feel like you care.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.193
Oh, because you have empathy for them.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.528
Well, you have to have
the appearance of empathy.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.074
Because they're like,
"My son, he didn't deserve this."

04:01.157 --> 04:04.369
And you're thinking, like, "Oh, geez.
I hope the diner is still open."

04:04.452 --> 04:07.080
And yes, of course your son
didn't deserve it, you know,

04:07.163 --> 04:08.456
but I don't know the full story.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.292
Maybe he did deserve it.
Maybe he was a real loud mouth.

04:12.877 --> 04:16.089
You know, one of the great
things about being a homicide detective?

04:16.172 --> 04:18.841
- Yeah?
- Is all the laughs.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.427
We have a lot of laughs here.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.847
Let me ask you a question.
You ever seen a dead body?

04:25.723 --> 04:27.642
- Yeah.
- Isn't it something?

04:27.725 --> 04:29.894
I remember my first. I was about six.

04:29.978 --> 04:34.649
We were at a carnival,
and there was a hobo and he got--

04:34.732 --> 04:35.984
You know, the big, the…

04:36.067 --> 04:37.652
- Ferris wheel?
- Ferris wheel!

04:37.735 --> 04:40.488
And he'd been sleeping. He was drunk.

04:40.571 --> 04:43.658
They started it up
and the guy got squished.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.414
Round and around and he was--
They couldn't turn it off.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.292
And all the kids, we're all screaming

04:52.375 --> 04:55.003
and crying and our parents were there.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.379
My dad actually left that night.

04:56.462 --> 05:01.092
And my last sight of him was him vomiting
as he got into his Caprice Classic.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.888
You got any funny stories?

05:07.640 --> 05:08.725
I don't.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.935
Look, there's one rule
that I got here on this job.

05:11.602 --> 05:12.937
Good take a note.

05:13.896 --> 05:19.444
Under no circumstances can you and I
fall in love with each other.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.280
It happens way more than you think.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.489
Yeah, not today.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.532
Look into my eyes.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.075
Mhm.

05:26.993 --> 05:27.869
You feeling anything?

05:27.952 --> 05:29.329
Nothing.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.496
Are you looking hard enough?

05:30.580 --> 05:31.497
Nothing's happening.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.876
Look at this eye. Look at this one.
This one's particularly deep.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.711
Nothing at all.

05:36.794 --> 05:40.214
There are a few exercises that we need
to run in order to make sure, okay?

05:40.298 --> 05:43.551
These are fail-safe ways
to ensure that nothing happens. Okay?

05:43.634 --> 05:45.762
So what we're going to do is we're going
to tell each other

05:45.845 --> 05:47.680
our most embarrassing secrets.

05:48.973 --> 05:52.727
And then there's no way that we will
become physically attracted to each other

05:52.810 --> 05:54.896
and then ultimately fall in love
which neither of us wants.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.856
- Ready? I'm going to go first.
- Mhm.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
I haven't flossed since 1992.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.443
Okay.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.529
You go. What do you got? Gross me out.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.573
My dog eats his own poop.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.950
Does he ever snack on other dog's poop?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.744
- He might. Uh-huh.
- He might.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.537
What kind of a dog are we talking about?

06:11.621 --> 06:12.830
He's a cute dog.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.082
- He's a cute dog.
- Yes.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.458
That eats his own shit.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.086
Sometimes a little poop from other dogs.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.005
Given that information,
I think I can trust you.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.092
It's go time, detectives.
There's been a murder.

06:24.175 --> 06:28.387
A beloved surgeon at City General Hospital
was killed. Get down there. ASAP.

06:28.471 --> 06:32.892
All right, Sharon Stone,
homicide trainee, let's do this.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.729
Oh, you know what?
I am going to bring some SLUDG.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.565
Crime scene is a great place
to find new customers.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.818
<i>We headed over to City General.</i>

06:41.901 --> 06:44.904
<i>When someone dies in the OR,</i>
<i>that's usually a tragedy.</i>

06:44.987 --> 06:50.326
<i>Today was also a tragedy,</i>
<i>but also a murder.</i>

06:51.327 --> 06:54.831
Okay. I want you to think of this
as your crime scene, Sharon,

06:54.914 --> 06:57.208
but I'm here in a supporting role. Okay?

06:57.291 --> 06:58.417
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.378
This is trainee, Sharon Stone,

07:00.461 --> 07:03.923
who feeds her dog
its own poop on a regular basis

07:04.006 --> 07:09.178
and is trying not to fall in love with me
and we'll see if that's successful or not.

07:09.262 --> 07:13.015
- Love seeing a lady detective. Yes.
- And you are?

07:13.099 --> 07:15.101
- Amber Kang. So excited.
- Pleased to meet you.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.894
- Amber Kang, forensics.
- Pleased to meet you, too.

07:16.978 --> 07:21.023
She's super cool. She likes to longboard.
She's into TikTok, etcetera.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.943
- So what happened to this person?
- Yeah, what do we got here, Amber?

07:24.026 --> 07:27.989
Honestly, the best looking corpse
you have ever laid eyes on.

07:29.157 --> 07:34.203
Sebastian Pierce, MD. His heart
was surgically removed from his chest.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.580
The murderer did this?

07:35.663 --> 07:40.501
Yes. This is definitely the work of a
skilled surgeon because these sutures are…

07:40.585 --> 07:43.796
- Beautifully done.
- The murderer went all the way along there

07:43.880 --> 07:46.007
and left nothing there or there.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.886
It's perfectly placed. Look at this.
Perfectly-- Perfect. Like from there.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.929
- Boop.
- Right there.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.389
- I know.
- Boop, boop.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.141
They just went from here…

07:55.224 --> 07:57.477
- Boop, boop.
- Boop. Bop, bop.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.020
Incredible.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.314
Do you think the killer made the sound?
Like…

08:01.397 --> 08:04.275
Do-do-do-do. Do!

08:04.358 --> 08:08.154
I don't know if I was in here I would have
been more like…

08:11.324 --> 08:12.783
Amber, is this your coffee?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.952
No, I only drink chai.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.498
So this belonged to the killer.
Let's bag it. I don't wanna touch it.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.709
Okay. Got it.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.712
- That is stickier than my last divorce.
- Slide it right there.

08:24.795 --> 08:25.838
- Okay.
- Okay, there we go.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.674
- Yep. There you go.
- Open it up. There we go. There we go.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.635
Ooh! I didn't know
you were gonna pour it.

08:30.718 --> 08:31.802
- I'm sorry.
- Well, the cup's not important.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.263
We're just gonna-- We don't--
It's the coffee, right?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.015
Better bag the cup, too.

08:36.098 --> 08:39.435
Okay, bag both.
Let's fan out. You go this way.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.730
I'm going to go this way and
let's just look for a few more clues.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.273
Wait. Do you hear that music?
What's that music?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.526
That's Mozart's Requiem.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.195
- Did you put this on?
- No, it was on when we arrived here.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.363
The killer must have played it.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.114
Whoa!

08:52.198 --> 08:53.533
- Stand back.
- What is that?

08:53.616 --> 08:54.575
Let me take a look.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.077
Oh my God, it's a heart.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.746
It looks like it's been stomped on.

08:58.829 --> 08:59.997
This is incredible evidence.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.082
We need to bag this.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.083
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.086
This is part of the body.
I need it for the autopsy.

09:05.169 --> 09:09.298
Sharon, tell her this is evidence.
We need this for the murder investigation.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.302
Sharon, whose side are you on? Are you on
my side? Are you on the side of science?

09:14.095 --> 09:15.805
I am always on the side of science.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.141
- Thank you. Wait, no, no.
- What? We need this. We need this.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.989
Fine. Fine. Fine. Take it, you psycho!

09:35.241 --> 09:37.285
You got lint on it.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.374
<i>Our first stop was the office</i>
<i>of City General's Chief administrator,</i>

09:43.457 --> 09:45.376
<i>Dr. Jocelyn Alexander.</i>

09:45.459 --> 09:49.714
<i>She'd been Pierce's boss,</i>
<i>and rumor was they had bad blood,</i>

09:49.797 --> 09:53.384
<i>which is a phrase I learned when</i>
<i>I try to donate to the Red Cross once.</i>

09:53.467 --> 09:59.807
If I had one of these,
it's going to say Terry Seattle, S.C.O.D.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.809
What does that mean?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.644
Super Cop On Duty.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.479
Oh…

10:05.563 --> 10:07.440
If you could put letters at the end,
what would you say?

10:07.523 --> 10:08.608
B.A.E.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.361
- Sharon Stone, B.A.E.?
- B.A.E. Badass Extraordinaire.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.449
- That scared me.
- It did?

10:16.532 --> 10:17.950
- I almost drew my firearm.
- Enough?

10:18.034 --> 10:20.870
God damn it, I forgot my firearm again.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.580
- I keep leaving it.
- Detectives, let's make this quick.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.874
This murder has really mucked up my day.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.627
Wow. Sorry for your loss.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.547
That's a pretty big violin.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.092
That's a cello, Detective.
I play in the local symphony.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.596
Yeah, I'd call it a mega fiddle.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.890
Could we get the show on the road, please?

10:40.973 --> 10:41.807
Go ahead, Sharon.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.352
Can you describe
your relationship with Dr. Pierce?

10:44.435 --> 10:45.353
I was his boss.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.357
But what kind of relationship
did you have with Dr. Pierce?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.359
That was our only relationship.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.443
Hold on one second.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.905
- She's being very elusive.
- Mhm.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.950
I think I'm gonna go a different route
with this. I want you to roll with me.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.535
All right, I'm in.

11:03.287 --> 11:07.875
Dr. Alexander, please forgive
my trainee here as she's new and stupid

11:07.958 --> 11:10.961
and she doesn't know
how pushy and rude she sounds.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.129
Well, she's very unlikable.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.131
Difficult's the word I usually get.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.885
Look, these interrogations
can be very impersonal,

11:17.968 --> 11:21.138
and we want to get to know you,
but we want you to also get to know us.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.682
So I'll tell you what,
we're going to ask you a question,

11:23.766 --> 11:26.602
and then you can ask us a question.
How about that?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.270
- I appreciate that.
- Okay.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.148
People don't really care
about my needs usually.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.776
I just have to solve everyone else's
problems around here.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.319
Alright, alright, this will be fun.

11:35.903 --> 11:39.365
So I'd like you to describe
your relationship with Dr. Pierce.

11:39.949 --> 11:43.160
I was his boss,
and he made my life miserable.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.663
He was a top-notch surgeon,

11:45.746 --> 11:49.625
but his perfect face
made everyone else a liability.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.669
Could you describe that for me?

11:51.752 --> 11:56.048
Do you know the doctors and nurses
were constantly losing their phones

11:56.132 --> 12:00.010
inside of patients because
they were trying to sext him mid surgery.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.221
Yes. It was a malpractice nightmare.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.557
Did you personally find him attractive?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.600
Wait, I think
she gets a question. Go ahead.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.810
- It is my turn, correct?
- Yeah.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.896
Again, you'll have to forgive
my partner. She's new.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.190
- I'm new and difficult.
- She's so dumb,

12:13.274 --> 12:16.026
and at the heart of it,
she's trying not to fall in love with me,

12:16.110 --> 12:18.320
and I don't think
she's having a very successful time of it.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.698
That leads me directly to my question.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.200
Do you find your partner attractive?

12:23.284 --> 12:25.619
Wow.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.123
Um, so about Dr. Pierce.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.416
Your honor, permission to treat

12:30.499 --> 12:33.461
the witness as hostile, am I right?
What part of your partner

12:33.544 --> 12:36.046
would you say is the most attractive?
Something physical.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.507
I like the silences.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.594
Mm. Fair enough. Okay, go ahead, go ahead.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.638
So can you think of anyone in particular

12:45.556 --> 12:49.310
who would want him dead?
And if it's yourself, why?

12:49.393 --> 12:53.481
There's absolutely a spurned lover,
a jilted husband.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.484
I mean, who knows?
It could have been anyone.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.943
People were obsessed with him.

12:58.027 --> 13:02.323
So what was the last time you spoke
to Dr. Pierce and what did he say?

13:02.406 --> 13:03.532
It was yesterday morning.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.243
He had just broken up
with one of our doctors,

13:06.327 --> 13:09.330
Madison Chen, and she flipped out.

13:09.830 --> 13:13.292
So this Madison Chen,
where was she when this murder took place?

13:13.375 --> 13:14.502
May I ask a question now?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.170
- Yes, please. I wish you would.
- I thought that was the game.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.297
- That's what the rules are for.
- All right.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.091
Did you cry when you lost your virginity?

13:21.175 --> 13:23.385
Okay, you know what? This interview
is over. All right, let's get out of here.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.970
- It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
- I think I'd like to know.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.473
- I think we would wanna--
- It happens to a lot of men.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.725
- I've got a question for you.
- Yes?

13:29.808 --> 13:32.102
Are you friends with anybody at the FDA?

13:32.686 --> 13:36.982
<i>Next up we headed over to</i>
<i>City Zumba to speak with Dr. Madison Chen.</i>

13:37.066 --> 13:39.527
<i>Dr. Pierce had dumped her</i>
<i>just before his murder.</i>

13:39.610 --> 13:44.573
<i>We needed to find out</i>
<i>if her symptoms included homicidal rage.</i>

13:44.657 --> 13:46.659
Wow, look at this place.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.745
It's like a SLUDG mongers wet dream.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.540
We're going to sell
two cases easy in here.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.125
- Over here, detectives!
- Ah!

13:55.209 --> 13:56.877
Dr. Madison Chen.

13:56.961 --> 14:01.674
I'm Detective Terry Seattle, and
this is homicide detective, Sharon Stone.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.218
So nice to meet you guys.
Thanks for coming here.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.887
This is my only hour off. Do you zumba?

14:07.638 --> 14:08.514
I don't, so…

14:08.597 --> 14:10.641
You know,
but you have the perfect body for it.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.393
- What about you, Detective?
- Thank you.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.852
No, I don't do anything
that doesn't involve

14:13.936 --> 14:16.105
either punching men or men punching me.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.816
Sometimes women punching me, too,
if I'm being totally honest.

14:18.899 --> 14:22.069
Oh, well, zumba may surprise you
and you're going to love the music.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.280
It's literally all I listen to these days.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.449
You seem pretty upbeat
considering your boyfriend just died.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.452
Well, you know, you--
The past is the past.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.371
You know, and he got what was coming.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.791
You seem like the kind of active go-getter
who would really benefit from SLUDG.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.377
I mean, it is packed
with herbal amphetamines.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.589
I don't need that. I mean,
the only stimulants I use these days

14:41.672 --> 14:43.299
are zumba and positive vibes.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.385
- Welcome to zumba.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.763
- Make your way to the dance floor.
- Okay, well, we have a couple of questions

14:49.847 --> 14:52.182
- about Dr. Sebastian Pierce's death.
- Now my regulars know I have one rule:

14:52.266 --> 14:55.853
always be moving. Let's kick it!

14:55.936 --> 14:58.022
- We do have some questions about--
- Hey, you two.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.982
- Yeah?
- Let's get those feet moving.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.818
I'm not in the class.
I'm a homicide detective.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.819
Sharon, show him your badge.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.362
Sorry, detectives. If you're in this room,

15:05.446 --> 15:08.240
you're moving. Let's go.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.075
- When he broke up with you,
- Okay, that's not a rule.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.702
- I mean, that's just a suggestion.
- did it break your heart?

15:11.785 --> 15:16.040
We were together for only a week,
but it felt like a lifetime, you know?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.208
- It was for him.
- I mean,

15:18.292 --> 15:22.004
because we did literally
everything together, even surgeries.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.672
Sebastian would cut them open.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.842
- And I'd stitch them back together.
- You are the stitcher-upper

15:26.926 --> 15:28.427
- of the heart surgery?
- Yes. Yeah. Oh, yeah,

15:28.510 --> 15:29.803
he always let me finish.

15:29.887 --> 15:30.888
- Okay.
- You know?

15:30.971 --> 15:32.973
That's important.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.100
Double time. Let's go.

15:35.184 --> 15:39.188
So why did you think
that he had this coming?

15:39.271 --> 15:42.650
Yesterday, out of the blue,
he just dumped me.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.862
Can you even imagine?
He ripped my heart out and stomped on it.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.823
He stomped on your heart. Okay.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.077
Oh, Christ. Christ, I honestly can't.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.955
And then I remembered my personal motto:

15:56.038 --> 15:59.166
when you're not happy,
just make yourself happy.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.001
Because guess what? I just got engaged.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.213
You just got to move on
because life moves fast at City General.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.881
I need some SLUDG.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.217
I need somewhere to throw up.
I gotta get some SLUDG.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.636
Back to the front. Other side, yeah.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.304
- I have one more question.
- Oh, please.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.516
If you were gonna rip
somebody's heart out and stomp on it,

16:15.599 --> 16:17.935
- would you sew them up afterwards?
- Yeah. Of course.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.980
- Thank you. See ya later.
- Bye.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.986
Sir, you on the gurney,
can I interest you in some SLUDG?

16:27.569 --> 16:30.656
Can I interest you in SLUDG?
SLUDG is great.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.784
FDA-approved, FDA of Guatemala
is about to approve SLUDG.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.703
Try some SLUDG. Just give it a shot.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.873
Probably just had a loss in the family.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.377
You know, we make a pretty good team.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.628
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.047
And I'm not just saying
the homicide stuff.

16:48.215 --> 16:54.013
I know that I said
that this shouldn't happen, but Sharon,

16:56.515 --> 16:58.934
I want you…

17:01.353 --> 17:03.230
to be my…

17:04.565 --> 17:06.275
SLUDG business partner.

17:06.984 --> 17:07.901
Oh…

17:07.985 --> 17:11.530
All I need from you
is just a cashier's check

17:11.613 --> 17:14.950
in the amount of my initial investment
or half of that

17:15.034 --> 17:17.578
or thirteen thousand dollars
in cash should be fine.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.747
Of course, two thirds of the--

17:19.830 --> 17:22.750
your proceeds for the first six years
of your franchise,

17:22.833 --> 17:25.335
but honestly, once I make my first sale,

17:25.419 --> 17:27.546
I really feel like
the money is going to start rolling in.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.591
- I respect your enthusiasm…
- Think about it.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.217
and I'm happy…

17:32.301 --> 17:34.053
- To think about it.
- to help you while I'm learning.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.846
As my partner. So, yes.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.016
No, but I'll help you while I'm learning.

17:41.101 --> 17:44.271
It's the first time I've been
in this hospital in 15 years.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.816
- Yeah.
- Why were you here 15 years ago?

17:48.609 --> 17:52.529
It was the night my old partner Lori died.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.825
<i>Her memory haunts my office like a ghost,</i>

17:56.909 --> 17:59.703
<i>like Lori's ghost, but it's not Lori.</i>

18:00.370 --> 18:01.997
<i>She always said</i>
<i>if she came back as a ghost,</i>

18:02.081 --> 18:05.042
<i>she'd give me an invisible wedgie</i>
<i>so I knew it was her.</i>

18:05.125 --> 18:09.296
<i>Anyway, the point is, her murder</i>
<i>was never solved, and I can't let go.</i>

18:09.922 --> 18:11.590
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.302
You want to tell me about the worst
thing that's ever happened to you?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.430
- You know, I was 13 or 14, and--
- Oh, my God, you know what?

18:18.514 --> 18:20.808
We got to get going
if we want to solve this crime.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.767
Yeah.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.520
You ready to kick
this investigation into high gear?

18:25.104 --> 18:25.687
Yeah.

18:25.771 --> 18:29.441
Okay. Time to scrub up.

18:29.525 --> 18:33.403
<i>Our final suspect was</i>
<i>Will Gonzalez, anesthesiologist.</i>

18:34.113 --> 18:36.448
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>his wife had a history with the victim,</i>

18:36.532 --> 18:39.576
<i>and not the textbook</i>
<i>kind of history, the sex kind.</i>

18:39.660 --> 18:43.330
<i>They'd had sex. Textbook intercourse.</i>

18:43.413 --> 18:44.748
Well, here we are.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.669
As expected, two actual doctors

18:48.752 --> 18:51.588
here to perform the surgery.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.007
Sorry, I don't think we've met.
Are you guys new at the hospital or?

18:54.091 --> 18:57.594
Yes. Very good. Dr. Brett Retterson,

18:58.178 --> 19:03.225
and this is the <i>Frau</i> Dr. Eva Brownfinger,

19:03.892 --> 19:07.563
a renowned German surgeon from Germany.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.314
Very thick accent.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.441
What hospital did you study at in Germany?

19:12.025 --> 19:16.822
The hospital
of the <i>Frau…</i> the <i>Frau Hungenshungen.</i>

19:16.905 --> 19:18.240
Very renowned.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.159
Wow, it's such an honor
to meet you, <i>Frau</i> Doctor.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.118
Yes, it is.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.453
Yeah, we are here to perform--

19:23.537 --> 19:27.207
- The surgery.
- The surgery which is obviously a--

19:27.291 --> 19:28.250
A cutting thing.

19:28.333 --> 19:32.421
Another thoracic
aortic dissection repair. Shit.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.881
- Everything okay?
- No, no, it's fine.

19:33.964 --> 19:34.965
It's just been a while since we've done

19:35.048 --> 19:37.301
- the thoracic surgery.
- I am good at that. I love the cutting.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.886
- Yeah, she loves the cutting.
- Cutting is my specialty.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.095
I am very good at the cutting.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.265
You need to stall this guy
and get the information out of him

19:43.348 --> 19:46.059
before we do any actual surgery, okay?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.395
Let's just do it.
Let's just play it that way, all right?

19:48.478 --> 19:51.356
So Dr. Gonzalez, I want to ask you,

19:51.440 --> 19:54.735
what was your relationship
with the Dr. Pierce?

19:54.818 --> 19:57.988
- I mean.
- This is German small talk by the way.

19:58.071 --> 20:01.366
The guy kind of had it coming.
I mean, it's not a huge deal.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.703
But, you know, you guys heard about
the thing. His relationship with my wife.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.580
The hanky-panky with the wife?

20:06.663 --> 20:08.540
But here's the thing,
it actually kind of worked out for me

20:08.624 --> 20:12.127
because I got a hall pass, which means
I get to bang a rando of my choosing.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.295
Rando means anybody.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.339
And my wife let me buy a boat.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.591
- That is a very sweet deal.
- Yeah.

20:17.674 --> 20:20.427
What made you want
to become an anesthesiologist?

20:20.510 --> 20:22.971
You know what's super funny about that
is I was gonna do surgery

20:23.055 --> 20:25.599
and I did a training everything,
but there's something so cool

20:25.682 --> 20:29.394
about being able to turn a little dial and
you turn this guy's brain into applesauce.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.520
- Sure.
- Right?

20:30.604 --> 20:32.940
You know, we really should
get started, guys. I love the small talk,

20:33.023 --> 20:34.650
but we don't want
to keep him under for long.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.444
Okay. Well, let's get going.
Hand me the knife.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.780
- I'm sorry. The knife?
- Scallop.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.657
- He means scalpel.
- Scalpel.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.618
You know what's so weird
is in my head I heard you say knife…

20:44.701 --> 20:46.203
- Yeah?
- and I'm like that is crazy.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.871
I haven't had my coffee today, clearly.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.414
Oh, my God. Oh. Sorry.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.208
- Okay, all right.
- Oh, my God,

20:51.291 --> 20:52.834
it's the marina where my boat is docked.

20:52.918 --> 20:53.752
- Okay.
- I got to take this.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.379
Sure. Well, we've got to

20:55.462 --> 20:56.880
- operate on this guy.
- Yeah, well, you know.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.590
Thank you for letting us do our job.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.176
I'm gonna make an incision.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.220
Just to look like
we know what we're doing here.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.348
Oh!

21:07.224 --> 21:08.976
- Oh, boy. Yeah.
- Oh! Look at that.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.852
- Let me get some gauze.
- Now he's got something.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.896
- Oh, goodness. Oh, goodness.
- Yeah, help with that. That's good.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.273
- Yeah, okay. You know what?
- Oh, my God.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.441
I'm gonna make another incision
just to kind of even it out

21:16.525 --> 21:17.442
- and relieve some of the pressure.
- Maybe not.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.694
- Maybe not.
- Just to relieve the pressure.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.488
- Oh, my God. The blood is everywhere.
- Oh, my God.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.948
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, put this original one.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.992
- Oh, shit.
- Here, plug this one, and I think that--

21:25.075 --> 21:26.743
I don't have any more.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.621
- Oh, goodness. Oh, goodness.
- He's pooling. He's pooling. Oh, boy.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.665
- Oh, lord.
- That's good. That's good. Hang on.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.417
- Oh, lord.
- Okay, okay, that's--

21:33.500 --> 21:34.960
- It's the blooding.
- To catch it.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.878
- It's blooding everywhere. Oh, shit.
- Catch it in this thing.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.422
- Oh. Here.
- You can make another incision.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.341
This is not a first-day thing.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.553
Okay. Hang on.
Yeah, now it's fine. It's fine.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.347
You put your finger there.
This one's going worse here.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.682
Unbelievable.

21:48.765 --> 21:51.476
- Yeah.
- Dr. Gonzalez, we have a little leak.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.687
I'm telling you,
I'm having a rough day, too.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.646
- Yeah?
- Something happened to my boat.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.190
Code blue. Let's get a crash cart.
We need to stop the bleeding.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.900
Yeah, definitely
get a drinks cart in here.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.694
- Crash cart.
- You guys got this?

22:00.777 --> 22:03.322
You go right step in there. Dr. Gonzalez.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.824
- Another successful thoratic--
- And to you.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.244
- Thoracic-- I can't. So many of them.
- You are very, very, very wonderful.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.579
<i>- Wunderbar.</i>
- Here we go.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.041
<i>After power washing</i>
<i>the blood off our bodies,</i>

22:14.124 --> 22:19.046
<i>we gathered the hospital staff so Sharon</i>
<i>could deliver her criminal diagnosis.</i>

22:19.129 --> 22:23.592
<i>It was time for her to tell us</i>
<i>who she believed had murdered Dr. Pierce.</i>

22:23.675 --> 22:26.762
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

22:27.471 --> 22:32.225
The time has come for homicide trainee,
Sharon Stone, to decide

22:32.309 --> 22:36.229
which of these three suspects
killed Dr. Pierce.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.981
Is it Dr. Chen,

22:38.732 --> 22:39.900
Dr. Alexander

22:40.692 --> 22:42.360
or Dr. Gonzalez?

22:42.944 --> 22:47.574
And she will do that just as soon
as I tell you about an incredible business

22:47.657 --> 22:49.159
and nutrition opportunity.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.952
You're not elephants.
Why work for peanuts?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.038
Just get on with it.

22:53.121 --> 22:54.498
All right. All right.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.250
Sharon, this is your moment to shine.

22:57.334 --> 23:02.089
I want you to take this glass of
very nutritious and easy-to-market SLUDG,

23:02.172 --> 23:06.051
and hand it to whoever
it is you think killed Dr. Pierce.

23:22.484 --> 23:27.572
- Me? What? No. This is outrageous.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.740
Hey, what's going on here?

23:28.824 --> 23:32.661
Chief, we just figured out
who killed Dr. Pierce.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.204
It was Dr. Chen.

23:34.287 --> 23:37.374
What exactly
convinced you it was Dr. Chen?

23:37.457 --> 23:43.255
Well, I felt that Dr. Chen moved on
pretty quickly to be engaged in one day,

23:43.338 --> 23:45.298
and didn't have any emotional bounce back.

23:45.382 --> 23:50.095
She also has the ability to do it
as a cardiothoracic surgeon

23:50.178 --> 23:51.513
and sew him up,

23:51.596 --> 23:54.516
and the head of the hospital
does not have a motive.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.935
She could just fire him for his troubles.

23:57.018 --> 24:02.399
And while our anesthesiologist, of course,
didn't like Dr. Pierce's behavior,

24:02.482 --> 24:08.113
he had some benefits from that,
so I felt that the spurned lover

24:08.196 --> 24:11.783
who seemed free of emotions in general.

24:11.867 --> 24:16.621
She also said that he ripped
her heart out and stomped on it,

24:16.705 --> 24:21.418
and that was the exact thing
that happened to Dr. Pierce.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.336
Amazing.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.298
Amazing.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.967
Amazing. I agree, amazing.

24:29.050 --> 24:32.220
You managed to get that completely--

24:35.849 --> 24:37.726
- Wrong.
- Did I?

24:37.809 --> 24:38.393
Yes,

24:38.476 --> 24:40.395
the killer was obviously

24:40.896 --> 24:42.814
Dr. Gonzalez.

24:43.481 --> 24:45.734
- Aw.
- Yes, he's an anesthesiologist,

24:45.817 --> 24:49.112
but he made a point of saying
that he had been trained as a surgeon.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.655
You know what's super funny about that

24:50.739 --> 24:52.782
is I was gonna do surgery
and I did the training and everything.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.493
<i>And remember the coffee cup</i>
<i>found at the crime scene?</i>

24:55.577 --> 24:58.997
Not only did Gonzalez
confirm he was a coffee drinker.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.916
I haven't had my coffee today, clearly.

25:00.999 --> 25:05.420
He had the exact same type of cup
with him during your undercover surgery.

25:05.503 --> 25:08.340
Obviously, it couldn't
have been Dr. Madison Chen.

25:08.423 --> 25:10.091
She doesn't even drink coffee.

25:10.175 --> 25:14.221
And the only stimulants I use these days
are zumba and positive vibes.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.474
And it wasn't Dr. Alexander.
She's not a surgeon.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.143
Her doctorate
is in hospital administration.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.104
<i>It said it right on her name plate.</i>

25:23.188 --> 25:26.441
But the final nail
in Dr. Gonzalez's coffin

25:26.524 --> 25:30.278
was the classical music
that was played during the murder.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.030
Wait, do you hear that music?
What's that music?

25:32.113 --> 25:33.490
That's Mozart's Requiem.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.701
Dr. Gonzalez was a big
classical music fan.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.119
How do we know?

25:38.912 --> 25:44.459
Because his ringtone was the same piece of
music that was playing during the murder.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.420
Oh, sorry. Oh, my God.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.590
I regret nothing.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.093
Except getting caught.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.428
Get back here!

25:55.512 --> 25:58.932
Dr. Gonzalez's career
has just been put to sleep.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.016
Sharon Stone,

26:00.809 --> 26:01.476
you're fired.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.144
Oh, thank God.

26:03.228 --> 26:07.565
You know what? You did a great job,
homicide trainee Sharon Stone.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.400
Thank you.

26:08.483 --> 26:09.651
And I'm sorry.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.153
We may not have fallen in love…

26:12.904 --> 26:15.115
- Mm.
- but at least we fell in like.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.492
Aw, Detective Seattle.

26:17.575 --> 26:20.328
What do you say we go out
and you let me buy you a drink?

26:20.412 --> 26:21.746
Ah. They're on me.

26:21.830 --> 26:25.500
- That sounds terrific. Let's go.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.294
Terry Seattle.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.838
Look, I told you not to shake it.

26:29.921 --> 26:33.717
It's extremely unstable.
Well, call the fire department.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.808
<i>I'd spent the day</i>
<i>surrounded by patients clinging to life,</i>

26:41.891 --> 26:44.728
<i>and I realized I'd been clinging as well,</i>

26:44.811 --> 26:46.688
<i>but I'd been clinging to death.</i>

26:47.188 --> 26:51.318
I've been trying for 15 years to honor
your legacy by finding your killer.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.778
Now I realize

26:53.862 --> 26:55.613
the best way to honor your memory

26:57.699 --> 26:59.451
is to finally let you go.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.831
Goodbye, Lori.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.180
Hello?

27:20.263 --> 27:22.932
<i>I have something</i>
<i>very important to tell you.</i>

27:23.016 --> 27:24.309
<i>It's about Lori.</i>

27:31.983 --> 27:34.611
<i>On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Murderville.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.863
Terry, this is your new partner,
Ken Jeong.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.448
- Hi.
- What are we ready to do?

27:38.531 --> 27:41.451
Unravel a vast conspiracy.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.204
- Who are you?
- Don't be alarmed. I'm here to help.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.956
I want you to gain his confidence
and find out everything he knows

27:47.040 --> 27:48.375
before he murders you.
