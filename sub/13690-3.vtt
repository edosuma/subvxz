-Justine.
-Did you sleep all right?

00:23.733 --> 00:28.278
-Eventually, thanks.
-I missed you.
Come back to bed.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.156
-Are you sure?
-I'm sorry.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.951
Silly to quarrel,
especially when
I've come all this way.

00:37.828 --> 00:40.497
I only wanted to know
who was looking
after the restaurant.

00:40.580 --> 00:44.375
What? You're asking me
who's looking
after the restaurant?

00:44.459 --> 00:47.753
-I just meant...
-(SIGHING) It's okay.

00:47.836 --> 00:51.381
Let's just forget about it.
Let's just...

00:53.007 --> 00:54.550
Yeah, let's.

01:01.973 --> 01:03.516
ARCHIE: We make a right pair,
don't we?

01:03.599 --> 01:06.310
JUSTINE: A good pair
I always thought.

01:06.393 --> 01:08.938
Let's make the most of
the next couple of days, huh?

01:09.021 --> 01:11.981
I'd like that.
Just the two of us.

(CLEARING THROAT)

01:17.820 --> 01:20.823
Sorry. You've got visitors.

01:20.905 --> 01:23.324
Who is it?

01:23.407 --> 01:25.910
Julie Andrews and
the von Trapp family.

02:03.316 --> 02:06.569
-Just hold that there.
-Katrina.

02:06.652 --> 02:10.280
Good morning. Shona.

02:10.363 --> 02:14.492
Mr MacDonald,
we'd like to thank you
on behalf of the school

02:14.576 --> 02:18.328
for your generosity
in donating land
for our new gym,

02:18.412 --> 02:22.915
which will be a valuable
resource for the whole
community of Glenbogle.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.417
Why, thank you.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.586
-That's you in a kilt.
-Oh, right.

02:31.548 --> 02:32.591
Thanks.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.094
I'm sorry we got
off on the wrong foot.

02:38.304 --> 02:40.513
And I was thinking,

02:40.597 --> 02:43.475
if you really want a hand
with the estate accounts,
I'd be happy to help out.

02:43.558 --> 02:45.018
Until you got someone better.

02:45.101 --> 02:48.103
No, no, you'll be great.
I'll take you up on that.

02:49.605 --> 02:52.523
Okay, kids,
say goodbye to Mr MacDonald.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.693
Goodbye, Mr MacDonald.

02:55.777 --> 02:58.028
Goodbye and thank you.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.908
Thanks, that was really nice.

03:03.908 --> 03:05.868
Archie?

03:05.951 --> 03:09.121
Oh, sweetheart, I was just...

03:09.205 --> 03:13.666
Thought you were never coming.
Morning.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.751
Aren't you going to
introduce me to your friend?

03:15.834 --> 03:17.169
Oh, right.

03:17.252 --> 03:20.422
Justine, this is Katrina.
Katrina, Justine.

03:20.506 --> 03:22.089
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:39.854 --> 03:42.816
So, what are you
two going to do today?
Hunting, fishing?

03:42.899 --> 03:46.819
Definitely not.
Business with
the hook in the fish's mouth.

03:48.237 --> 03:51.447
Actually, I thought we'd
just hang out together.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.616
Hang what out?

03:53.699 --> 03:58.120
Take no notice of
my husband, Justine.
He's a very rude man.

03:58.203 --> 04:00.205
Quality time, you know.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.960
-Is this...
-Porridge.

04:06.043 --> 04:07.795

04:11.714 --> 04:14.050
Justine, are you
sure about those shoes?

04:14.134 --> 04:17.886
No. But I certainly
wasn't putting my feet
into your dad's old wellies.

04:17.970 --> 04:20.055
They can go for
a walk on their own.

04:20.139 --> 04:22.223
Oh, aren't they sweet, Hector?

04:22.306 --> 04:25.684
Do you remember
when we were like that,
star-crossed, young lovers?

04:25.768 --> 04:27.602
Molly, please. Act your age.

04:27.686 --> 04:30.272
Oh, why don't we
hang out together
just like them?

04:30.355 --> 04:33.108
But why?
What'd be the point of that?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.779
What do you think of it, then?

04:39.863 --> 04:45.118
A bit Gothic.
A bit forbidding.
A bit of a monstrosity.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.660
Monstrosity?

04:48.494 --> 04:51.706
I can see you're
very attached to it.

04:51.789 --> 04:54.709
You must admit, it is
like the house in Psycho.

04:54.792 --> 04:56.461
Remind me not
to have a shower.

04:56.544 --> 04:59.962
That's all right
'cause there aren't any.
Not just yet anyway.

05:03.966 --> 05:05.801
Oh, who's that, then?

05:08.137 --> 05:09.596
What's he up to?

05:15.684 --> 05:18.937
HECTOR: Morning, boys.
Long time no see.
Been busy, then?

05:19.021 --> 05:22.732
-Quiet of late, sir.
-Since we finished
the nuclear power plant.

05:22.815 --> 05:25.276
Right, jolly good.
I'll lead on, then.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.615
Just wait here,
will you, Justine?
I'll be back in a minute.

05:31.698 --> 05:35.159
Archie? Where are you going?
I want to talk to you.

this modern obsession
for having a lavatory

05:54.342 --> 05:56.219

Weak bladder, weak mind.

05:58.386 --> 06:01.098
Quite.

-What's going on?
-Ah, the MacSween brothers,
Archie.

06:04.225 --> 06:06.811
Probably last saw
the boy in short trousers.

-Aye.
-Aye.

-Father, can I have a word?
-Yeah.

06:21.031 --> 06:22.281
Archie!

06:23.366 --> 06:25.368
What are you doing?

06:25.451 --> 06:28.036
You said we needed builders
to tart the place up for your
precious paying guest.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.955
-So I telephoned
the MacSweens.
-But...

06:30.038 --> 06:32.332
I thought you'd be pleased.
It's what you wanted,
isn't it?

06:32.416 --> 06:34.750
Yes, but are they any good?

06:34.834 --> 06:37.920
-They're very reasonable.
-They're not, are they?

Don't tell me they're the ones

all the maintenance on
the house since the war.

great-grandfather built it.

in from Inverness,

That way you keep the peace.
All right?

07:02.315 --> 07:04.817
Very well. One condition.

I supervise everything, okay?
-All right.

Can I ask you something?

building up to it all day.

No. The thing is...

know how to ask her.

07:41.306 --> 07:42.682
How did you know that?

want to take her.

-But how?
-Oh, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan.

Is it new?
-A gambling debt.

-It was either this or
a full set of broken fingers.
-How thrilling. You're joking?

it to the Italians.
They know about style.

cooking tomorrow night.

to come with me?

-It would be nice
to get the chance.

you were doing here

You know, where I come from,
only drug dealers drive
foxy vehicles like that.

16:31.957 --> 16:35.459
Oh, well, can't stand
around gossiping all day.

16:36.377 --> 16:38.212
I'm in a pickle and a stew.

16:38.296 --> 16:41.172
I'm here to throw myself
on your charity
and generosity.

16:41.256 --> 16:44.050
You are jesting!
You're as rich as Croesus.

16:44.134 --> 16:46.677
Whatever's the matter,
Kilwillie?

16:46.760 --> 16:49.972
I've done a deal with
these Fujiyama car people.

16:50.055 --> 16:52.015
For them to take over
my place for three days

16:52.098 --> 16:54.600
so they can show
their latest model
to the press.

16:54.684 --> 16:58.020
I've got 50 journalists
coming to get wined and dined

16:58.103 --> 17:00.397
and play Damon Hill
on my mountain roads.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.442
-It's a great way
to diversify income.
-MOLLY: So?

17:04.525 --> 17:06.736
Well, they were due to come
the day after tomorrow.

17:06.819 --> 17:10.280
But they've just rung up today
and said now they
want to come tomorrow.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.531
Put on a special
dinner in the evening.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.200
-But tomorrow
night's the ball.
-I know.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.161
It's obvious what
you must do, Kilwillie.

17:17.243 --> 17:20.079
Tell them to
take a running jump
into Yokohama Bay.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.873
I can't, old man.

17:21.955 --> 17:25.417
They've given me 50 grand
and a brand-new motor

17:25.501 --> 17:27.586
and I want them to
come back next year.

17:27.669 --> 17:31.506
I warned you. This is
exactly the kind of curse
you call upon your head

17:31.590 --> 17:33.924
when you sign a compact
with the devil commerce.

17:34.008 --> 17:37.053
Oh, be realistic, Father.
Kilwillie's doing
exactly what he has to.

17:37.136 --> 17:41.765
So when you said you were
throwing yourself
on our thingummies...

17:41.848 --> 17:44.975
-Well, I was just wondering...
-Oh, no.

17:45.059 --> 17:47.353
If you could possibly
see your way to...

17:47.435 --> 17:49.647
Absolutely and definitely not.

17:49.730 --> 17:52.732
But you always used to
have the ball
here until Jamie...

17:55.652 --> 18:01.448
Er, it's too much
to ask, Kilwillie.
One day's notice, the dust.

18:01.530 --> 18:05.868
The thing is,
we've got the builders in.
Well, sort of builders.

18:07.828 --> 18:08.912
Oh, dear.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.706
But you can't cancel the ball.

18:11.790 --> 18:15.417
The whole community's
looking forward to it so much.

18:15.501 --> 18:17.795
Yeah, I'm sorry,
we're gonna have to say no.

18:20.255 --> 18:22.632
Hang on. I could do it.

18:24.384 --> 18:27.010
-What?
-With everyone's help.

18:27.094 --> 18:29.513
-Justine.
-Come on.

18:29.596 --> 18:33.182
We run a restaurant.
I used to organise
events just like this.

18:33.265 --> 18:36.227
It's a piece of cake,
provided you've
got leadership.

18:36.310 --> 18:39.688
-Oh, I say.
-Now listen here.

18:39.771 --> 18:41.648
Let's start with the basics.

18:48.153 --> 18:52.073
Okay, nice space.

18:52.156 --> 18:55.243
The dancing could be here.
There's a band?

18:55.326 --> 18:59.079
-KATRINA: A kind of
second-hand Jimmy Shand.
-Band will go there.

18:59.162 --> 19:03.874
Food in the dining room,
bar in the library.
There's outside caterers?

19:03.958 --> 19:06.127
What a marvellous girl.

19:06.210 --> 19:08.837
I'll give them a call
in the morning, sort out
the other details then.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.339
Well, if you really
think you can do it.

19:11.423 --> 19:13.550
I wash my hands of
the whole business.

19:13.633 --> 19:16.927
She's completely marvellous.

19:17.011 --> 19:21.139
-Okay, then, why not?
-If everyone pitches in.

19:21.222 --> 19:24.559
-Maybe Katrina can
help me tomorrow.
-Me?

19:24.642 --> 19:28.937
For the sake of the community.
After all, there's so
much to be done here.

19:29.021 --> 19:31.732
People like you and me
should work together.

19:42.157 --> 19:45.409
-KATRINA: Who's that?
-It's me.

19:48.245 --> 19:52.081
-Who's me?
-Me, you daft gowk.

19:58.170 --> 19:59.254
Alan.

20:08.179 --> 20:10.388
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

20:10.472 --> 20:14.558
Doing my best.
Got any Hobnobs?

20:16.101 --> 20:19.313
You really take the biscuit,
you know that?

20:19.396 --> 20:22.106
-What are you doing here?
-Fact-finding mission.

20:22.190 --> 20:23.983
New policy document
on agriculture.

20:24.067 --> 20:26.902
The plight of crofters
and tenant farmers.

20:26.985 --> 20:29.363
So the party sends
its spin-doctor-in-chief

20:29.446 --> 20:31.907
and he just happens
to come to my glen.

20:31.990 --> 20:34.408
Smells fishy to me.

20:34.492 --> 20:37.244
Any chance of a bed
for a weary traveller?

20:38.703 --> 20:40.914
I'll get you
a pillow for the sofa.

21:09.813 --> 21:13.900
Oh, Hector.
What can I do for you?

21:13.984 --> 21:18.237
-Who were you gallivanting
with this afternoon?
-Just a friend.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.197
We don't have any friends
who own
off-white Rolls-Royces.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.574
We don't, but I do.

21:23.658 --> 21:26.119
Who is he?

21:26.201 --> 21:28.412
His name is Geordie.
He's my bookie.

21:29.538 --> 21:33.332
-Your what?
-My turf accountant.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.710
Good God.

21:35.793 --> 21:39.045
-What do you get
up to together?
-Well, what do you think?

21:39.129 --> 21:42.549
You are shameless.
I don't know
what to say to you.

21:42.632 --> 21:46.844
Tell me I'm a jezebel.
I've always wanted
to be called that.

21:46.927 --> 21:49.847
This must cease
with immediate effect.
Do you understand?

21:49.930 --> 21:53.600
Oh,
don't be so stuffy, Hector.
We're just good friends.

21:54.684 --> 21:56.476
Aren't you staying?

21:57.978 --> 22:02.107
I'm going to my room
to consider my position.

22:07.903 --> 22:08.945
(CLATTERING)

22:09.029 --> 22:10.822
(HECTOR EXCLAIMING)

22:10.906 --> 22:13.783
-Are you all right?
-Blasted builders!

22:15.242 --> 22:16.911
(DOOR SLAMMING)

22:31.340 --> 22:36.177
I'm so sorry.
Perhaps you'd prefer it
if I retrieved your stick?

22:38.470 --> 22:41.348
Sometimes I wonder what
the point of you two is.

22:48.479 --> 22:50.396
Can't see it, can you?

22:51.314 --> 22:52.398
Just wood.

22:54.567 --> 22:58.654
I've decided. This was a tick.
Cross was down there.

23:06.535 --> 23:07.954
Let's get to work.

23:18.212 --> 23:20.088
Hey, teach.

23:20.171 --> 23:23.049
Off to indoctrinate
young minds, are you?

23:23.132 --> 23:25.927
Ha. You should
have your own show.

23:26.010 --> 23:29.471
Anyway, it's Saturday,
you whose finger's
on the nation's pulse.

23:29.554 --> 23:32.682
Can I buy you dinner tonight?
For old times' sake.

23:32.765 --> 23:37.144
Which old times would they be?
The time I found you in
bed with somebody else?

23:37.228 --> 23:41.147
Come on,
where'd you sleep last night,
the knife drawer?

23:41.231 --> 23:42.899
Life's too short for this.

23:42.983 --> 23:44.483
-I'm out tonight.
-Right.

23:44.567 --> 23:47.194
-I do have a social life.
-Where are you going?

23:47.278 --> 23:51.656
If you must know,
I'm going to a ball
at Glenbogle House.

23:51.739 --> 23:56.326
A ball? My, my, aren't
you the social climber?

23:56.410 --> 23:57.953
(DOOR SLAMMING)

23:59.705 --> 24:02.206
Molly, these are beautiful.

24:02.290 --> 24:05.418
I stopped buying
clothes years ago,
when the money ran out.

24:05.501 --> 24:07.253
I don't even buy
knickers any more.

24:07.336 --> 24:11.047
-Really? So...
-I just don't
bother wearing them.

24:11.131 --> 24:14.925
-Molly.
-It's wonderful.
I do recommend it.

24:15.009 --> 24:19.638
It's rather a splendid thing
making sensual discoveries
at my time of life.

24:19.722 --> 24:21.598
Oh, this is exquisite.

24:21.681 --> 24:25.435
Mind you, I don't
think Hector's noticed.
Givenchy, 1959.

24:25.518 --> 24:28.979
-Oh, this is sweet, too.
-Dior, 1963.

24:29.062 --> 24:32.773
Oh, and I had this made
for Jamie's christening.

24:32.857 --> 24:37.320
-I can still get
into it, you know.
-Molly, you are a marvel.

24:37.403 --> 24:40.947
No, I'm not.
Oh, you are sweet.

24:43.867 --> 24:47.202
I'd like to see some
photos of Jamie and Archie
when they were little.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.330
So would I.
We have some of Archie,

24:49.413 --> 24:52.165
but the best ones of Jamie
disappeared years ago.

24:52.248 --> 24:56.335
-No.
-Such a pity,
they just sort of got lost.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.047
So, which one is it to be?

25:09.262 --> 25:14.099
Morning.
Taking the beasts to market?

25:14.183 --> 25:18.062
Taking them walkies, you mean.
Different pasture every day.

25:18.145 --> 25:20.855
It's not good
for them, you know.
I'm trying to fatten them up,

25:20.939 --> 25:22.982
not put them through
a Jane Fonda exercise course.

25:23.066 --> 25:24.609
Have you got a problem?

25:24.692 --> 25:29.238
Landlord type problem.
Toffee-nosed git
called Kilwillie.

25:29.321 --> 25:31.657
You're a shepherd
from Liverpool?

25:31.740 --> 25:34.325
Birkenhead.
Something wrong with that?

25:34.408 --> 25:38.203
Not at all. I embrace
the vision of the new
Scotland being a healthy,

25:38.286 --> 25:42.332
multicultural and
truly modern society.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.668
So, what's this
about your landlord?

25:45.751 --> 25:49.380
No, nothing fancy.
Just all the regular numbers.

25:51.256 --> 25:54.801
Okay, great.
Thanks a lot. Bye.

25:57.844 --> 25:59.596
Katrina,
how are you getting on?

25:59.680 --> 26:01.598
Managed to sort out
the band yet?

26:01.682 --> 26:04.267
It wasn't easy but
I managed it in the end.

26:04.350 --> 26:06.310
I'm just doing
the accounts now.

26:06.394 --> 26:10.355
So kind of you to help Archie
out until he gets some
professional help.

26:12.399 --> 26:15.150
What...
What the hell are you doing?

26:15.234 --> 26:16.485
This room is never
to be touched!

26:16.569 --> 26:19.154
Mr Hector, we...

26:19.238 --> 26:21.948
-What's happening?
-The boys,
they've done the wrong room.

26:22.031 --> 26:23.908
-The cross had gone.
-What?

26:23.992 --> 26:27.786
-Ticks and crosses, all gone.
-You clowns. Our son's room!

26:27.870 --> 26:30.789
-Come on, Hector.
-I want this room put
back exactly as you found it.

26:30.873 --> 26:32.248
You were supposed
to be in charge.

26:32.331 --> 26:34.250
"I'll supervise it all,"
you said.
The old story.

26:34.333 --> 26:37.336
-Why is it you
always let me down?
-Come on, Hector, come away.

26:38.336 --> 26:40.130
We found something.

26:41.298 --> 26:45.009
The skirting by
the fireplace was loose.

26:45.092 --> 26:47.011
Someone must have
hid it years back.

26:49.179 --> 26:51.639
"JM." It must have been Jamie.

26:56.518 --> 26:59.563
-GOLLY: What is it?
-They found this
in Jamie's room.

27:04.984 --> 27:06.194
Archie?

27:11.448 --> 27:13.658
Come with me, lass.

27:15.784 --> 27:18.245
There's something
you should know.

27:30.672 --> 27:33.382
MOLLY: All his old things.

27:40.555 --> 27:41.890
School reports.

27:50.146 --> 27:53.191
GOLLY: Jamie was
the older of the two boys.

27:53.274 --> 27:55.276
Good at everything he touched.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.070
He could shoot better than me,
fish better than his father.

27:58.153 --> 28:01.448
Wasn't short of
brains neither.

28:02.323 --> 28:04.867
The golden boy.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.078
It wasn't easy for
Archie to live up to him,

28:07.161 --> 28:10.789
especially when
he knew how much
Hector doted on Jamie.

28:13.667 --> 28:16.710
But Archie didn't resent him.
He couldn't.

28:19.630 --> 28:21.172
What happened?

28:22.966 --> 28:28.637
Ah, well, one summer,
Archie was 14, Jamie 18,
about to go to Oxford.

28:30.305 --> 28:33.891
And they came out here one day
in Hector's old dinghy.

28:35.101 --> 28:37.228
Calm as a millpond.

28:38.895 --> 28:42.566
And then Archie
started acting the goat.

28:42.649 --> 28:46.235
Leaping up and
down in the prow.

28:46.318 --> 28:49.071
Well, the top and the bottom
was he capsized the thing.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.658
So in they went,
which was not a problem

28:53.741 --> 28:56.159
as they could both swim
like fishes,

28:57.828 --> 29:01.623
but they had a dog with them,
Hector's old Labrador,

29:01.707 --> 29:05.251
and she panicked
and went under.

29:07.336 --> 29:10.380
Now Jamie took
a mouthful of air
and swam after her

29:12.549 --> 29:15.092
just as Archie was
climbing on to the boat.

29:17.344 --> 29:21.055
-And...
-He never came back up?

29:22.682 --> 29:26.768
Yeah, the police divers
found him six hours later

29:26.852 --> 29:30.272
caught up in
the weeds by that inlet there.

29:30.355 --> 29:31.898
You know something?

29:33.191 --> 29:36.986
It was the day of
the Glenbogle ball.

29:37.069 --> 29:40.864
I had to stand out front
to receive all these
folk in their finery,

29:42.199 --> 29:45.409
explain what had
happened over and over again.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.247
Molly cried for a year.

29:51.331 --> 29:54.125
Hector never shed
a tear so she said.

29:56.251 --> 29:59.922
As for Archie and
his father, well...

30:00.005 --> 30:02.924
how could things
ever be the same again?

30:13.766 --> 30:17.937
I'm glad we found
these old things.

30:19.396 --> 30:20.772
It's good to have them.

30:37.119 --> 30:38.453
Dear boy.

30:40.247 --> 30:42.791
When will I be
free of it, Mother?

30:44.124 --> 30:48.629
Archie, get on with your life.

30:48.712 --> 30:52.882
Take your girl to the ball.
Be happy.

31:00.013 --> 31:03.975
Ah, come on, Lewis. Come on.

31:11.147 --> 31:15.151
-Here, boys.
It wasn't your fault.
-Thanks, ma'am.

31:23.032 --> 31:25.368
MAN: Will you go and find out?

31:39.087 --> 31:40.547
Archie, I...

31:45.176 --> 31:47.511
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

31:58.729 --> 32:02.940
What can I say to you, Archie?
Only that I'm sorry.

32:04.609 --> 32:06.777
My mother says, "Get on
with your life, Archie,"

32:06.861 --> 32:09.946
but sometimes
I don't know what
my life is, you know.

32:12.949 --> 32:15.701
Well, it's not just
you wondering that.

32:15.784 --> 32:18.496
I know,
I'm so privileged, but...

32:23.666 --> 32:25.335
Thanks, Katrina.

32:29.671 --> 32:32.089
Listen, I'd better go.
The ball.

33:10.539 --> 33:13.791
So, that's
the Laird of Glenbogle.

37:55.692 --> 37:57.945
The way to get at folk

No, but his death still
hurts someone I care about.
