00:31.473 --> 00:33.473
Dr Schwiman
was so right.

00:33.475 --> 00:34.939
Isn't this romantic?

00:36.308 --> 00:40.040
This bike weigh's
as much as a dead cow.

00:40.042 --> 00:41.909
Who designed
these bikes, Hitler?

00:42.475 --> 00:43.475
My God!

00:44.807 --> 00:46.339
They use these
in the Tour de France?

00:46.341 --> 00:48.373
Well, everything is old here,
it's part of the charm.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.876
Mine's broken I think.

00:54.107 --> 00:55.372
And I think it's going
to rain.

00:55.374 --> 00:56.939
Why do you have to be
so pessimistic?

00:56.941 --> 00:58.641
I'm not pessimistic.

00:59.742 --> 01:01.372
I'm realistic.

01:01.374 --> 01:03.206
Exact same thing for you.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.372
Where are we?
What arrondissement is this?

01:05.373 --> 01:07.640
Why don't you ride next to me
instead of behind me because

01:07.642 --> 01:09.040
I may as well be
riding alone.

01:10.640 --> 01:13.207
Suit yourself.
I'm tired anyway.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.408
Suit yourself.

02:18.442 --> 02:19.442
<i>Ole!</i>

03:35.807 --> 03:37.139
Is my husband here?

03:37.141 --> 03:38.538
No, madam.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.038
We were worrying
about you.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.106
No, no harm done.
What about Jacques?

03:42.108 --> 03:43.642
Ready and waiting!

03:44.707 --> 03:46.006
Brace yourself, pal.

03:46.008 --> 03:49.206
Look at that. Madam,
I'm doubling my fee.

03:56.374 --> 03:59.071
The security man
out there, didn't let me in.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.406
Of course not. We have the
Lord Mayor of London coming.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.971
Really? Sexy!
Can I say hello?

04:04.973 --> 04:07.406
- Well, he's coming with his husband.
- Too bad.

04:07.408 --> 04:08.742
Today's mail, madam.

04:10.241 --> 04:11.809
And this came by messenger.

04:46.307 --> 04:48.472
I want some
chocolate milk.

04:48.474 --> 04:50.872
And I'll have a double vodka
on the rocks.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.239
Steven!

04:52.241 --> 04:53.775
How are you,
silly monkeys?

04:54.475 --> 04:55.475
Sean.

04:56.641 --> 04:57.839
How are you, Maria?

04:57.841 --> 04:59.540
Mr. Stevens,
when did you get here?

04:59.542 --> 05:01.706
Just this afternoon.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.804
What's happening here? Is it
someone's birthday or something?

05:03.806 --> 05:04.972
Nothing like that.

05:04.974 --> 05:06.605
Just a small dinner
for twelve.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.608
Ah...

05:10.108 --> 05:11.108
Thank you.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.972
Come on Rose, you need
to eat something.

05:13.974 --> 05:15.272
No.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.305
Please Mr. Steven,
tell her.

05:17.307 --> 05:18.773
What are you doing,
Rose,

05:18.775 --> 05:20.406
starving yourself
like Mommy?

05:20.408 --> 05:21.575
Skinny Mommy, yes!

05:22.108 --> 05:23.871
Well, don't.

05:23.873 --> 05:25.374
No one likes
a human toothpick.

05:26.774 --> 05:28.040
I'm going to find our dad.

05:30.273 --> 05:33.875
Listen to your big brother and
finish those potatoes, please.

05:36.538 --> 05:37.538
Okay. Try that.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.353
Aren't you
going to miss it?

05:41.274 --> 05:43.039
Of course,
I'm going to miss it.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.207
This was your grandfather's
greatest acquisition.

05:46.108 --> 05:47.475
He'd cut
my balls off.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.138
Why don't you sell
something else?

05:50.140 --> 05:52.304
You still don't get. I'm hanging
by my fingernails here.

05:52.306 --> 05:53.539
I need the money.

05:53.541 --> 05:55.075
Anne's costing you
that much?

05:56.074 --> 05:57.108
Sell her jewels.

05:58.206 --> 05:59.208
You're not funny.

06:01.741 --> 06:03.272
Do you want me to
lend you something?

06:03.274 --> 06:04.706
Could you?

06:04.708 --> 06:06.239
Fifty-thousand,
just for a few days,

06:06.241 --> 06:07.573
until the sale goes through?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.639
I'll call Mom.

06:08.641 --> 06:09.873
Don't do that.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.407
Don't give her
the satisfaction.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.872
How is she, anyway?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.305
Getting older and
heavier by the day.

06:17.307 --> 06:18.375
Richer, too.

06:19.541 --> 06:20.941
Middle East foggy London.

06:21.973 --> 06:23.208
She voted Brexit.

06:24.241 --> 06:25.804
Makes sense.

06:25.806 --> 06:28.938
When you were born she was
nuts about Margaret Thatcher.

06:28.940 --> 06:31.039
She said I had to
vote for Reagan.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.105
Did you?

06:32.107 --> 06:35.071
No.
We were in Athens.

06:35.073 --> 06:36.975
Our last horrible year.

06:40.542 --> 06:41.542
How's the writing going?

06:42.741 --> 06:45.372
Yeah, my publisher's
coming to Paris.

06:45.374 --> 06:46.574
I've got nothing
to show him.

06:47.306 --> 06:48.308
He knows it.

06:49.374 --> 06:50.772
So, why is he coming?

06:50.774 --> 06:52.740
When he writes off
the Eurostar trip,

06:54.540 --> 06:55.808
I'm one of his best assets.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.804
Go on, sir, take one.

07:32.806 --> 07:35.273
In my country,
we call it mektoub.

07:35.275 --> 07:36.541
Your future.

07:42.574 --> 07:44.807
Tonight you will meet
someone special.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.106
It's not very original.

07:48.108 --> 07:51.272
No? And what if
that someone special

07:51.274 --> 07:54.474
is a mysterious,
beautiful lady.

08:14.541 --> 08:15.542
Zip me up.

08:19.807 --> 08:21.308
I'd rather undress you.

08:23.806 --> 08:26.574
Well,
you had your chance.

08:32.940 --> 08:36.405
Ten, eleven, twelve.
Thirteen?

08:37.474 --> 08:39.238
Exactly.
Who did this?

08:39.240 --> 08:41.273
I did.

08:41.275 --> 08:42.471
- Hello, Anne.
- Hmm.

08:42.472 --> 08:43.938
Welcome to Paris,
Steven,

08:43.940 --> 08:45.204
please make yourself
at home.

08:45.206 --> 08:46.539
Yes and invite yourself
to dinner.

08:46.541 --> 08:48.471
No, Bob invited me.

08:48.473 --> 08:50.871
He didn't say a word.
Typical.

08:50.873 --> 08:53.637
Well, I am not having thirteen at my table.
It is bad luck.

08:53.639 --> 08:55.506
And what's worse,
it's me.

08:55.508 --> 08:57.705
Sorry about that, Anne, but my
father is really excited to see me.

08:57.707 --> 08:59.305
Especially now as it happens.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.638
Oh my God. Get rid of those.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.905
Anne,
be proud of them.

09:03.907 --> 09:05.971
How about I kill you?

09:05.973 --> 09:09.405
Head down.
Rotate for a single axis.

09:09.407 --> 09:11.072
See. I remember every word.

09:11.074 --> 09:14.041
Admit it. I'm a fast learner.
And so is my father.

09:15.273 --> 09:16.604
Add another place setting.

09:16.606 --> 09:18.608
There's one more chair
in the corner. And hurry.

09:19.574 --> 09:20.741
You look beautiful, Anne.

09:31.974 --> 09:32.975
This one's fine.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.874
Hey stop. All of you.
Turn around. Look at me.

09:40.807 --> 09:41.807
I need another woman.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.438
Madam? No.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.573
There's no other
solution.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.472
Madam,
I am the maid.

09:49.474 --> 09:51.439
Maid's don't have dinner
with the bosses.

09:51.441 --> 09:53.904
Oh, nonsense.
You're part of this family.

09:53.906 --> 09:55.138
I have
a terrible accent.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.907
Your accent is charming.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.604
But what will I say?

09:59.606 --> 10:01.473
Well, it's not about talking.
It's about sitting.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.938
You know how to sit,
don't you?

10:02.940 --> 10:04.474
Now come, we have
no time to argue.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.604
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Come on.

10:09.606 --> 10:12.105
Which? No, no.
Oh my God.

10:12.107 --> 10:14.138
Here. See if
this one fits.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.704
We're not the
same size, madam.

10:15.706 --> 10:17.372
What about Mandy?
Mandy can do this.

10:17.374 --> 10:19.637
Maria, be serious.
Mandy is a Filipino.

10:19.639 --> 10:21.771
Nobody invites a Filipino
to a dinner party.

10:21.773 --> 10:24.273
Maybe Aung San Suu Kyi because
she won a Nobel peace Prize.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.939
And she's from Burma,
that's different.

10:25.941 --> 10:28.139
Mandy, she speaks terrible
English and terrible French.

10:28.141 --> 10:30.138
I'm not even sure she
knows how to speak Filipino.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.105
No, no. We will be
found out in a second!

10:32.107 --> 10:33.470
Found out?

10:33.472 --> 10:35.737
Yes. We're not going to
tell them you're the maid.

10:35.739 --> 10:37.739
So what are we
going to say, madam?

10:37.741 --> 10:38.806
Nothing.

10:38.808 --> 10:40.771
Just act like a friend.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.604
I think I'm going to faint, madam.
I'm unable to lie.

10:43.606 --> 10:44.872
No, no, it's okay.

10:44.874 --> 10:46.871
All women can lie.
It's all about smiling.

10:46.873 --> 10:48.472
- Like this?
- Mmm.

10:48.474 --> 10:50.073
And Josiane?
What about Josiane?

10:50.075 --> 10:52.071
She just started here.
I don't know her.

10:52.073 --> 10:53.972
Josiane is very funny,
madam.

10:53.974 --> 10:55.405
She know how to
make jokes.

10:55.407 --> 10:57.470
She even imitates Sarkozy.

10:57.472 --> 10:58.872
She could be
the perfect guest.

10:58.874 --> 11:00.372
Josiane is at least a 12.

11:00.374 --> 11:02.437
You're pear-shaped
but you're not fat.

11:02.439 --> 11:04.372
Okay, so we'll go with
the pants you have on.

11:04.374 --> 11:05.605
It's not a good idea.

11:05.607 --> 11:07.538
Yes. Yes.
It is a good idea.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.771
Come on, Maria.
Come on.

11:09.773 --> 11:11.705
We'll look back on this
and laugh one day.

11:11.707 --> 11:13.805
It's going to be like that time
in the chalet when Rose was two

11:13.807 --> 11:14.972
and you dressed up
like Santa.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.072
Remember that?
With the beard.

11:16.074 --> 11:17.074
Jacques!

11:17.740 --> 11:19.106
Okay, there you are.

11:19.108 --> 11:20.971
Know listen, make it not
to big and not too showy.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.272
Just make it quick.

11:22.274 --> 11:23.441
What about her shoes?

11:24.440 --> 11:25.871
What size are you?

11:25.873 --> 11:26.939
I'm an eight, madam.

11:26.941 --> 11:28.737
Oh, my God.

11:28.739 --> 11:31.206
Just hide them.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.537
No rich woman
wears an eight.

11:32.539 --> 11:34.707
Louboutin doesn't even
make an eight. Stay.

11:39.473 --> 11:42.239
Toby! Welcome to Paris.

11:42.241 --> 11:43.904
Glad they didn't
stop you at the border.

11:43.906 --> 11:46.570
Well, as Lord Mayor
I'm issuing visas for London.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.404
You say the word,
Bob, I'll give you one.

11:48.406 --> 11:50.738
London?
Where is that anyhow?

11:50.740 --> 11:52.572
Little England.
Former Empire.

11:52.574 --> 11:56.405
- I remember now. Rue Bretagna.
- That's the one.

11:56.407 --> 11:58.804
You must be Michael.
Bob Fredericks.

11:58.806 --> 12:00.373
Pleased to meet you.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.039
Nice little place you've have here.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.437
Family <i>pied de terre.</i>
Small but cozy.

12:04.439 --> 12:05.640
Hi, Toby!

12:06.740 --> 12:07.740
Fabulous.

12:08.806 --> 12:09.874
Hello, Michael.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.106
My dears!

12:13.108 --> 12:15.038
I'm sorry about
the security detail.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.938
It's Toby's favorite
style statement.

12:16.940 --> 12:18.370
Did you bring
your food taster?

12:18.372 --> 12:20.274
What if we're serving
poison tonight?

12:24.073 --> 12:25.305
I have no news, Bob.

12:25.307 --> 12:27.239
But calm down,
it's okay. It's okay.

12:27.241 --> 12:29.041
Just give them another week.
It'll be fine.

12:32.907 --> 12:35.040
- Antoine! Helene! <i>Bonsoir.</i>
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>

12:36.307 --> 12:37.607
So nice to
see you again.

12:39.106 --> 12:42.638
This place is so amazing.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.405
Only you Americans
can come to this...

12:44.407 --> 12:46.905
Ah! Steven!
I read your book.

12:46.907 --> 12:48.371
Really?

12:48.373 --> 12:50.271
It's so very funny. Your
father's making hole-in-one.

12:50.273 --> 12:52.705
Anne taking all the credit.
Firing all the sexy girls.

12:52.707 --> 12:55.272
Nothing changed. They're
still Punch and Judy.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.904
Congratulations on the
re-election, by the way.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.239
Yes, thank you.

12:58.241 --> 12:59.538
Keep going, you'll be
England's first family.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.239
Well, don't you
write about us.

13:01.241 --> 13:03.472
Don't want the entire world knowing
about our every little secret.

13:03.474 --> 13:07.105
Don't worry. I couldn't be more blocked
if I'd eaten a pound of cement.

13:07.107 --> 13:08.205
Put me somewhere nice.

13:08.207 --> 13:10.206
I have.
In the corner.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.071
Look at that.
Homemade.

13:12.073 --> 13:13.607
Lovely.

13:16.141 --> 13:19.940
The trick is to pretend you're
carrying a Chinese vase on your head.

13:20.506 --> 13:22.038
Steven!

13:22.040 --> 13:23.538
You walk tall and slow.

13:23.540 --> 13:25.441
And you shine, Maria.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.707
You shine.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.072
This is not going to work.

13:31.407 --> 13:32.906
You know baby,
it's cold outside so

13:32.908 --> 13:34.741
I think you're going to
need an extra layer.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.805
Mr. Steven, it's summertime.

13:37.807 --> 13:40.072
Exactly.
It's party time.

13:40.074 --> 13:42.238
Antoine, you still haven't told
me how you want to deal the press.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.571
It's not every day
a Caravaggio changes hands.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.939
There's
no rush, is there?

13:46.941 --> 13:51.539
Of course not. We both have to
be satisfied with the results.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.272
The X-ray team were asking for
another ten thousand euros.

13:54.274 --> 13:56.737
They're sending their best
people over from New York.

13:56.739 --> 13:59.139
Bob, let me split
the fee with you.

13:59.141 --> 14:01.906
Absolutely not.
I wouldn't hear of it.

14:01.908 --> 14:05.105
Just give me an invitation
once it's on your wall.

14:05.107 --> 14:07.073
I won't keep it
at home.

14:07.075 --> 14:09.141
It will have a pride
of place at my museum.

14:10.740 --> 14:11.807
Once we know
it's real.

14:14.073 --> 14:15.074
Maria?

14:16.073 --> 14:17.338
What is this nonsense?

14:17.340 --> 14:19.271
It's not
going to work, madam.

14:19.273 --> 14:21.270
Your friends, the Bernards. They have been
here before, they would have seen her.

14:21.272 --> 14:23.437
They haven't seen her.
Nobody looks at a maid.

14:23.439 --> 14:25.738
Now come on out here,
Maria, right this minute.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.237
They will recognize me, madam.

14:27.239 --> 14:29.805
Well, if they find
your face familiar,

14:29.807 --> 14:31.572
they'll just think they
saw you at a fashion show.

14:31.574 --> 14:33.538
Madam, you know
it's a sin to lie?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.304
You're not lying,
you're not hurting anybody.

14:35.306 --> 14:37.304
It's like a part in
our own little play.

14:37.306 --> 14:39.105
It's fun. It's like
being in a movie.

14:39.107 --> 14:41.605
Except you're changing your life
from ABC to HBO, you get it?

14:41.607 --> 14:43.038
Not really.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.138
I'll make it
simple, avoid them.

14:45.140 --> 14:47.370
You're at the far end
of the table anyway.

14:47.372 --> 14:50.804
What about Jacques? Jacques would
make a perfect guest, madam.

14:50.806 --> 14:53.304
Steven, you have
a dress I can wear?

14:53.306 --> 14:55.271
No, no, no.
Forget it. Okay.

14:55.273 --> 14:57.538
This is Bob's fault and
I want him to suffer.

14:57.540 --> 15:00.538
Now, Maria let me
look at you.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.973
Oh my God.
She's not even dressed.

15:02.975 --> 15:05.406
Will you get her pulled together, please.
And listen to me.

15:06.074 --> 15:07.370
Don't speak to much.

15:07.372 --> 15:10.638
Don't smile too much
and don't eat too much.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.105
Yes, madam.

15:12.107 --> 15:16.904
Don't drink too much either.
Nobody likes that. Trust me.

15:16.906 --> 15:19.237
How do I rate amongst
your students?

15:19.239 --> 15:21.537
You're definitely not
the most disciplined one.

15:21.539 --> 15:23.738
You're the most studious.
You're the most studious one.

15:23.740 --> 15:25.605
- The most studious one?
- Yes.

15:25.607 --> 15:27.939
I wish I could think of something
to say now in French but

15:27.941 --> 15:29.370
now I'm baffled.

15:29.372 --> 15:31.138
You're always baffled.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.039
Anne! Not always.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.471
You remember
my French teacher?

15:34.473 --> 15:35.772
Ah! Yes, Melanie.

15:35.774 --> 15:37.104
Fanny. I'm Fanny.

15:37.106 --> 15:39.471
Of course.
How silly of me.

15:39.473 --> 15:41.640
Don't worry about it. I'll
answer to almost anything.

15:43.773 --> 15:44.773
Ah.

15:56.941 --> 15:58.207
Don't speak to much.

15:58.973 --> 16:01.105
Don't eat too much.

16:01.107 --> 16:02.474
Don't smile to much.

16:34.407 --> 16:35.407
Who is that?

16:38.140 --> 16:41.138
What's her name.
Who is she really?

16:41.140 --> 16:42.937
What are you
talking about?

16:42.939 --> 16:45.972
She'll claim she's Maria
Escalante but the truth is she's

16:45.974 --> 16:48.241
Maria Immaculata
of the Two Sicilies.

16:49.307 --> 16:50.538
You're not serious?

16:50.540 --> 16:54.604
Countess of Asturias,
the House of Bourbon,

16:54.606 --> 16:56.572
second cousin of
Juan Carlos.

16:56.574 --> 16:57.774
She'll deny it.

16:59.073 --> 17:00.139
And I never told you.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.038
Are you a fan
of Caravaggio?

17:13.040 --> 17:14.941
I love the holy family.

17:15.940 --> 17:16.941
Oh. Good for you.

17:18.739 --> 17:22.204
I keep a portrait of the
baby Jesus by my bed.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.605
Oh, by whom? I'm a big
fan of the masters.

17:24.607 --> 17:25.607
Let me guess.

17:26.539 --> 17:27.539
- El Greco.
- No.

17:28.073 --> 17:29.271
- Goya.
- No.

17:29.273 --> 17:30.805
No, I've got it.

17:30.807 --> 17:32.704
Dali.
I'm right, yes?

17:32.706 --> 17:34.873
The artist doesn't
matter so much.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.040
It's the expression
on the baby's face.

17:38.239 --> 17:40.071
Yes. We musn't
take that for granted.

17:40.073 --> 17:44.238
And the holy mother.
How she loves him.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.607
<i>Madame,</i>
The dinner is served.

17:50.873 --> 17:56.138
So, tonight's a sort of
last supper in a way.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.472
This maybe the last time
you see this painting.

17:58.474 --> 18:01.304
I'm brokering this sale
to Antoine Bernard.

18:01.306 --> 18:02.771
Oh, <i>Monsieur</i> Antoine.

18:02.773 --> 18:04.372
He's a friend
of the family.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.939
Ah, excellent.

18:05.941 --> 18:07.240
Let me introduce myself.

18:10.072 --> 18:11.940
I am David Morgan.
I live in London.

18:12.473 --> 18:13.473
I am Maria.

18:14.706 --> 18:16.237
No second name?

18:16.239 --> 18:17.604
No, no. Not tonight.

18:17.606 --> 18:20.039
I'm a friend of madam.
A friend of a friend.

18:21.907 --> 18:23.441
HBO, not ABC.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.373
Oh, thank you.

18:32.106 --> 18:33.204
<i>Bon Appetit.</i>

18:33.206 --> 18:34.406
<i>Bon Appetit,</i> darling.

18:44.307 --> 18:47.472
So being married to the
mayor of London makes you what?

18:47.474 --> 18:49.370
Everybody's asking.

18:49.372 --> 18:51.271
Just another
queen I guess.

18:51.273 --> 18:53.538
Wow. That's great.
You should carry a purse.

18:53.540 --> 18:54.805
And what do you do
for a living?

18:54.807 --> 18:55.904
I'm a hairdresser.

18:55.906 --> 18:56.907
Oh great.

18:57.806 --> 18:59.105
No, I'm joking.

18:59.107 --> 19:00.538
I used to be.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.572
Then I thought I can't
be gay and a hairdresser.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.371
- Too much of a cliché. So I changed everthing.
- Oh. And you became?

19:05.373 --> 19:06.571
- Butcher.
- Oh.

19:06.573 --> 19:07.638
I'm joking.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.737
He's a shrink...

19:08.739 --> 19:10.104
He let you
run for office?

19:10.106 --> 19:11.704
I know.
Malpractice.

19:11.706 --> 19:13.471
I'll say.

19:13.473 --> 19:16.604
So, France, Paris.
Why did you come here?

19:16.606 --> 19:17.937
This house
for one thing.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.471
- And my grandfather was French.
- Oh.

19:20.473 --> 19:25.304
And to keep a woman, at some point
you have to satisfy their neurosis.

19:25.306 --> 19:26.937
They are all satisfied
analyst in New York.

19:26.939 --> 19:28.038
She talks about him?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.704
Oh, not of everyone.

19:29.706 --> 19:31.704
I think the good doctor Schwiman
can teach Michael a thing or two.

19:31.706 --> 19:33.737
About billing, no question.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.205
Did you rehearse?

19:35.207 --> 19:36.772
Or do you always
speak this fast?

19:36.774 --> 19:38.905
Yes. In such a brilliant
and sarcastic way.

19:38.907 --> 19:40.704
- Years of training, my dear.
- Oh.

19:40.706 --> 19:43.871
It's harder to lie when
you speak faster.

19:43.873 --> 19:47.105
I guess that's why my
husband speaks so slowly.

19:47.107 --> 19:50.441
The Eiffel Tower has a sexual symbol
supposed to save your marriage.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.537
I will ask him.

19:53.539 --> 19:55.638
Do you really think
that love can last?

19:55.640 --> 19:57.071
I mean,
you're so smart.

19:57.073 --> 19:59.070
Could you still be
one of those?

19:59.072 --> 20:00.206
You have to let go.

20:01.307 --> 20:03.774
Well, flowers freeze
and blossom again.

20:05.306 --> 20:06.807
Don't be so cynical.

20:10.773 --> 20:12.470
Oh. And what do
you suggest?

20:12.472 --> 20:14.905
Adultery, darling.

20:14.907 --> 20:17.936
You're just taking the problem
with you wherever you go.

20:17.938 --> 20:21.106
Make a best friend of your husband
and have lunch with me tomorrow.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.907
Oh. You're evil.

20:25.273 --> 20:26.372
No, I'm French.

20:43.073 --> 20:44.073
Oh, oh!

20:46.573 --> 20:48.404
Go. Go.
Let me help.

20:48.406 --> 20:49.406
It's only water.

20:51.207 --> 20:54.104
I like to pour water on
myself so women can help me.

20:54.106 --> 20:55.305
Looks like fun.

20:55.307 --> 20:56.638
It's generic.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.470
When women sees a stain,
she must come and rub.

20:59.472 --> 21:02.271
You're funny. I mean,
for an American, obviously.

21:02.273 --> 21:05.638
Wow. Every guy from Cambridge
knows how to judge funny.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.037
All the English men I know think
they're funny but they never laugh.

21:09.039 --> 21:11.272
I hate them.

21:11.274 --> 21:12.371
So do I.

21:12.373 --> 21:13.407
What do you think, Maria?

21:15.406 --> 21:17.738
I don't like
English people.

21:17.740 --> 21:20.271
But I do like Hugh Grant.
You know Hugh Grant?

21:20.273 --> 21:21.671
In <i>Bridget Jones.</i>

21:21.673 --> 21:24.871
He's also the one dancing
in <i>Love Actually.</i>

21:24.873 --> 21:29.103
Like this. <i>♪ I take
it down ♪ I take it down</i>

21:29.105 --> 21:34.437
<i>♪ You're more more more
♪ Jump, Jumping</i>

21:34.439 --> 21:36.537
You know Hugh Grant?
The beautiful one.

21:36.539 --> 21:38.737
He also had an
affair with...

21:41.540 --> 21:43.071
The prostitute.

21:43.073 --> 21:46.137
Well, Of course we all
know who Hugh Grant is.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.970
You were just saying
about knowing who laugh...

21:47.972 --> 21:49.806
You look like him.
Like Hugh Grant.

21:52.072 --> 21:54.238
We all look the same from the
same part of the world. You know.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.205
Same face. Same blue eyes.
Same same funny teeth.

21:58.207 --> 22:00.538
That's beautiful.
Very beautiful.

22:00.540 --> 22:02.638
But I don't like the stupid
films he is in though.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.805
Always happy endings
and kisses in the rain.

22:04.807 --> 22:06.274
You should not
despise people.

22:07.274 --> 22:09.539
People love
happy endings, you know.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.105
They can't fight it.

22:11.107 --> 22:14.204
The hero runs.
He kisses her in the rain.

22:14.206 --> 22:15.307
People love that.

22:16.606 --> 22:18.004
Well...

22:18.006 --> 22:19.803
Would you ever consider
running for prime minister?

22:19.805 --> 22:20.972
I thought supreme leader.

22:20.974 --> 22:22.871
Would you ever
run for president?

22:22.873 --> 22:24.137
If you were
my first lady.

22:24.139 --> 22:25.540
Are you in politics?

22:26.239 --> 22:28.803
No. I'm a musician.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.737
A classical pianist
to be precise.

22:30.739 --> 22:32.571
Great.
How old are you?

22:32.573 --> 22:34.470
Nine and a half.
And you?

22:34.472 --> 22:36.538
Thirty two and a half.

22:36.540 --> 22:38.604
Is that your father
sitting next to you?

22:38.606 --> 22:41.271
Oh no. That's Fedore.
The Master.

22:41.273 --> 22:42.404
Oh.

22:42.406 --> 22:44.104
Well. I hope
you enjoy dinner.

22:44.106 --> 22:45.307
I'm so glad
you could come.

22:46.140 --> 22:47.207
Does he speak English?

22:48.040 --> 22:50.238
Oh, no.
He never speaks.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.372
Yeah. So there's
our Franck and Robin.

22:52.374 --> 22:55.205
Oh, they're beautiful.
Just like their mother.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.138
Oh, thank you.

22:58.140 --> 23:02.904
You know, it is so hard to keep being
sexy when you're a single mom.

23:02.906 --> 23:04.572
It's a constant battle.

23:04.574 --> 23:07.971
I went to this great seminar about
fighting for yourself last month,

23:07.973 --> 23:09.570
Justin Tender.
Do you know him?

23:09.572 --> 23:12.637
It was in London. Oh, my God.
He is so spiritual.

23:12.639 --> 23:13.904
Amazing. Anyway...

23:13.906 --> 23:17.071
He says that it all
starts with food.

23:17.073 --> 23:18.904
He also recommends
that you drink less.

23:18.906 --> 23:20.071
What? Water?

23:22.240 --> 23:23.871
Anne told me
you were funny.

23:23.873 --> 23:26.639
You know, she's been wanting
us to meet for a long time.

23:26.641 --> 23:29.539
Yes. She's
a force of nature, Anne.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.271
Talk to me. This
woman's a nightmare.

23:32.273 --> 23:34.471
How do you know
she's not my friend?

23:34.473 --> 23:35.639
Well, if
that's the truth

23:35.641 --> 23:37.038
I'm going to fake
a heart attack

23:37.040 --> 23:38.804
and get dragged out
of here by my ankles.

23:38.806 --> 23:40.137
Say something to me.
Talk to me.

23:40.139 --> 23:41.337
Tell me a joke
or something.

23:41.339 --> 23:43.304
She's all over me
like a bad suit.

23:43.306 --> 23:45.304
I don't know any joke.

23:45.306 --> 23:46.540
Well,
make something up.

23:48.307 --> 23:50.040
You're putting a lot of
pressure on me.

23:52.706 --> 23:54.407
Where's that
charming accent from?

23:55.939 --> 23:57.737
I'm a Spanish.

23:57.739 --> 23:59.203
I was born in Majorca.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.537
Asturias. I thought
it was Asturias.

24:02.539 --> 24:05.471
My ancestors were
from Asturias.

24:05.473 --> 24:07.608
See, I'm Celtic like you.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.238
Where is your family from?

24:10.240 --> 24:14.138
Oh, well my family is from a
very lovely county called Downe.

24:14.140 --> 24:16.905
My father owns
most of it. You know.

24:16.907 --> 24:19.304
He always wants me
to get my art hobby

24:19.306 --> 24:22.640
out of my system and come back
and run the family estate.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.805
You came here to
escape your father.

24:26.807 --> 24:29.404
Well, I came to London
to be an artist.

24:29.406 --> 24:31.103
But I wind up
being a consultant.

24:31.105 --> 24:33.370
So I spend my life
now flying between

24:33.372 --> 24:37.371
hotels and New York
and Paris and London.

24:37.373 --> 24:40.305
To be fair I don't know
where my real home is.

24:40.307 --> 24:42.804
Probably because
it's still in Dine.

24:42.806 --> 24:44.736
- Dine? Downe.
- Dan.

24:44.738 --> 24:45.971
- Downe.
- Dine. Downe.

24:45.973 --> 24:47.371
Dine. Downe.
Up down.

24:47.373 --> 24:49.373
Maria? Sorry, David. I'm
stealing her for a minute.

24:51.206 --> 24:52.940
Don't drink too much.

24:53.706 --> 24:54.771
No, sir.

24:54.773 --> 24:56.305
Madam told me
what to do.

24:56.307 --> 24:57.473
And what not to do.

24:58.473 --> 25:00.471
What's with
this silly idea.

25:00.473 --> 25:02.472
You must be dying here.

25:02.474 --> 25:05.770
It's like me sitting in
a plumber meeting.

25:05.772 --> 25:08.371
I was supposed to
sit close to madam.

25:08.373 --> 25:11.771
But I think somebody
mixed up the place cards.

25:11.773 --> 25:13.971
This scary fashion lady
must be here.

25:13.973 --> 25:16.570
Don't talk like a maid.

25:16.572 --> 25:18.374
Just yes or no
at the end.

25:19.539 --> 25:23.506
Be really impossible.

25:23.973 --> 25:25.171
Unpleasant.

25:25.173 --> 25:26.903
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, Bob!

25:26.905 --> 25:29.138
Maria's got some great jokes.
I bet you didn't know that?

25:29.140 --> 25:30.637
No. I did.

25:30.639 --> 25:32.704
Yes. She was just
about to tell me one.

25:32.706 --> 25:35.204
Madam Bernard, would you like
to hear one of Maria's jokes?

25:35.206 --> 25:37.036
Yes. Of course.

25:37.038 --> 25:39.707
Don't force her.
She's embarrassed.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.541
And very shy.

25:42.439 --> 25:43.770
I'm very unpleasant.

25:43.772 --> 25:44.904
Oh, come on.

25:44.906 --> 25:46.372
You're very funny.

25:46.374 --> 25:47.603
We're all friends here.
Who'd like to hear a joke.

25:47.605 --> 25:48.771
- Oh, no.
- Come on love.

25:48.773 --> 25:51.204
Everyone's funny with
a Spanish accent.

25:51.206 --> 25:54.104
The only joke I know
is very vulgar.

25:54.106 --> 25:57.205
My uncle, Pedro, used to
tell it when he was drunk.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.537
I don't think
it's appropriated.

25:58.539 --> 25:59.803
Oh, no, don't bother.

25:59.805 --> 26:01.105
Don't force yourself.

26:01.107 --> 26:02.627
Come on. Live a little.
Tell us a joke.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.974
Okay. You want it.
You have it.

26:07.239 --> 26:09.071
A family's at
the dinner table.

26:09.073 --> 26:14.570
The son asks the father, "Dad, how
many kinds of boobs are there?"

26:14.572 --> 26:16.603
The father surprised,
answer.

26:16.605 --> 26:20.407
"Well my son, a woman
goes through three phases:

26:21.906 --> 26:25.573
"In her twenties, a woman's
breast are like melons.

26:26.572 --> 26:28.870
"Round and firm.

26:28.872 --> 26:32.405
"In her thirties and forties
they are like pears.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.874
"Still nice but
hanging a bit.

26:36.105 --> 26:38.505
"In her fifties,
they are like onions."

26:39.073 --> 26:40.371
"Onions, Dad?"

26:40.373 --> 26:43.569
"Yes. You see them
and they make you cry."

26:46.472 --> 26:48.071
Hilarious.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.870
Wait. I didn't finish yet
because I'm translating

26:50.872 --> 26:52.503
straight from the Spanish
in my head.

26:52.505 --> 26:54.970
This one's amusing. She just
like Google translator.

26:54.972 --> 26:57.138
The daughter asks
the mother:

26:57.140 --> 27:00.206
"Mom, how many kinds of
willies are there?"

27:01.307 --> 27:02.938
The mother answers.

27:02.940 --> 27:06.804
"Well my dear, a man goes
through three phases too..."

27:06.806 --> 27:08.326
Love the voice of
the wife. Keep going.

27:09.939 --> 27:16.205
"In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree.
Mighty and hard.

27:16.207 --> 27:22.406
"In his 30s and 40s, it's like a
birch tree, flexible but reliable.

27:24.239 --> 27:27.304
"After 50, it's like
a Christmas tree."

27:27.306 --> 27:29.703
"A Christmas tree, Mommy?"
"Yes.

27:29.705 --> 27:33.871
"Dead from the root up and the
balls are just for decoration."

27:38.072 --> 27:40.038
That's a rude joke.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.737
It's not even funny.

27:41.739 --> 27:43.470
I have a better one about
Do you want to hear it?

27:43.472 --> 27:45.436
No, that will be fine.
Thank you.

27:45.438 --> 27:47.773
I think that's plenty.
Thank you. You're so...

27:48.305 --> 27:49.439
She's so funny.

27:53.106 --> 27:57.570
I can understand now why my dad
is making so much progress in french.

27:57.572 --> 28:01.039
Bet he took one look at you and said
I want to learn French immediately.

28:02.106 --> 28:03.106
No.

28:04.540 --> 28:07.436
His wife forced him
to learn

28:07.438 --> 28:09.105
<i>la langue de</i> Moliere.

28:09.107 --> 28:10.271
Thank you for this.

28:10.273 --> 28:11.637
It's become my
instant favorite.

28:11.639 --> 28:13.707
So you're the revenge.

28:14.473 --> 28:15.607
I don't get it.

28:17.406 --> 28:19.606
She used to
be his golf teacher.

28:43.706 --> 28:47.105
So, what do I need to wear
to look more Parisian?

28:47.107 --> 28:48.970
Women are
always asking me that.

28:48.972 --> 28:51.037
No one can buy that.

28:51.039 --> 28:54.237
That's why I'm asking
for your advice.

28:54.239 --> 28:56.470
Oh, I love what you
did with the issue by the way.

28:56.472 --> 28:58.402
Oh, I try my best.

28:58.404 --> 29:02.704
As my grandmother always say,
tell the truth it's easy to remember.

29:02.706 --> 29:07.104
You know, in therapy I hear so
many lies, contradictions...

29:07.106 --> 29:09.603
But even your lies say
something about you...

29:09.605 --> 29:11.870
Um, yeah.
I'm going to marry you.

29:11.872 --> 29:14.073
And what makes you
think I'd say yes.

29:15.107 --> 29:17.307
Are all women
mad about you?

29:18.772 --> 29:19.772
The night is young.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.570
So sorry for
ignoring you buddy

29:24.572 --> 29:26.737
but this girl next to me
is really sexy.

29:26.739 --> 29:27.938
It's okay.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.403
I'm used to
not talking.

29:29.405 --> 29:30.806
You know,
with Fedor.

29:31.572 --> 29:33.369
Go and get her.

29:33.371 --> 29:35.105
Cheers, buddy.
High five.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.903
I'm not insured
for high fives.

29:36.905 --> 29:37.906
No?

29:39.405 --> 29:40.706
Are you allowed
to touch boobs?

29:42.207 --> 29:44.438
I guess so but I've never
had the opportunity.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.370
I hope I'm not
being to forward.

29:46.372 --> 29:47.739
I'd just like to say,

29:48.806 --> 29:50.806
you look absolutely
beautiful tonight.

29:51.805 --> 29:52.972
Thank you.

29:52.974 --> 29:54.214
How long have you
been in Paris?

29:55.905 --> 29:58.570
How long have you been
sleeping with my dad?

29:58.572 --> 30:02.074
Are you crazy?
I'm just his teacher.

30:02.973 --> 30:04.936
Look at you.
Your dad.

30:04.938 --> 30:06.371
Makes you sound
so childish.

30:06.373 --> 30:08.303
You look like a child.

30:08.305 --> 30:09.870
I'd really like to
spank you.

30:13.873 --> 30:19.904
But your dad warned me that you were
rude, alcoholic and unemployed.

30:19.906 --> 30:22.971
Yeah, but I also have some really bad
points. Did he tell you what those were?

30:22.973 --> 30:24.804
You look very elegant too.

30:24.806 --> 30:28.870
Well, I'm the best in my price range.

30:28.872 --> 30:31.137
- Fanny you're going to be my new mother in law.
- Shhh!

30:31.139 --> 30:33.772
It's like you and your dad are
the only two men on the planet.

30:34.373 --> 30:36.536
Oh, I see.

30:36.538 --> 30:38.937
Why would you want the egg when
you've already got the goose.

30:38.939 --> 30:40.404
I don't want the goose

30:40.406 --> 30:42.906
and I don't like the rotten egg.
Actually.

30:51.272 --> 30:52.572
Dearest darling Daddy,

30:53.639 --> 30:59.637
and his ageless,
gorgeous concubine.

30:59.639 --> 31:00.974
- Steven.
- Sorry. Sorry.

31:02.539 --> 31:04.537
Step-mom, Anne

31:04.539 --> 31:10.204
Thank you so much for inviting me
tonight to this amazing place.

31:10.206 --> 31:12.737
Where generosity
holds no bounds.

31:12.739 --> 31:14.603
Actually that's
who's getting the tab.

31:14.605 --> 31:16.305
Anyway. Not important.

31:17.706 --> 31:18.972
I digress.

31:18.974 --> 31:20.971
I'd just like to make
an announcement.

31:20.973 --> 31:27.271
My engagement to this amazing,
beautiful, talented creature.

31:27.273 --> 31:28.369
What's your name again?

31:28.371 --> 31:29.870
Fuck you.

31:29.872 --> 31:31.992
Fuck you. That's an unusual name.
Don't be shy, honey.

31:35.140 --> 31:36.436
Don Maria.

31:36.438 --> 31:38.078
Your Highness, I would
like your blessing.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.070
Congratulations.

31:49.072 --> 31:50.537
Thank you.

31:50.539 --> 31:52.805
Well, dear guests,

31:52.807 --> 31:55.904
we have the great honor
of sharing the table tonight

31:55.906 --> 31:58.038
with a very young,
talented prodigy:

31:58.040 --> 32:02.437
Gilles Durand and his
master Fedor Krachinsky.

32:02.439 --> 32:05.303
Gilles is only nine years old and needs
to get some sleep because he's playing

32:05.305 --> 32:07.437
a very special concert
in Vienna tomorrow night.

32:07.439 --> 32:11.402
So, we will have dessert in the
music room after we hear some...

32:11.404 --> 32:13.571
Songs my mother
taught me.

32:13.573 --> 32:14.707
Arranged by the master.

32:15.572 --> 32:16.572
There you have it.

32:16.973 --> 32:17.974
Please.

33:11.205 --> 33:12.270
Clean this.

33:12.272 --> 33:13.773
Rub, rub, rub...

33:14.872 --> 33:16.436
You did for
a long time.

33:16.438 --> 33:17.539
Not true, Mandy.

33:26.873 --> 33:27.874
We said hardly speak.

33:28.905 --> 33:30.370
I made them laugh,
madam.

33:30.372 --> 33:33.270
Yeah. Even the scary,
fashion woman.

33:33.272 --> 33:36.106
Madam, you heard that from
the other side of the table?

33:37.072 --> 33:38.970
Dinners are my job.

33:38.972 --> 33:42.537
I can follow five conversations
at the same time.

33:42.539 --> 33:44.406
And do you know what
your job is, Maria?

33:48.239 --> 33:51.771
You don't even know how
to recognize laughter.

33:51.773 --> 33:55.136
You don't know if you're
making people laugh

33:55.138 --> 33:57.737
or if they're
laughing at you.

33:57.739 --> 34:01.939
I mean can you tell the difference
between Hahaha and ohhohohoh.

34:03.371 --> 34:06.870
So actually you
never really laugh?

34:06.872 --> 34:09.038
You were supposed to play the
part of the missing guest.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.703
Silent. Forgettable.

34:10.705 --> 34:13.101
If someone finds out about
this, I will be embarrassed.

34:13.103 --> 34:14.871
And so will they.

34:14.873 --> 34:17.572
That they laughed
at my joke?

34:18.706 --> 34:20.638
Don't you play
the victim.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.436
You know I'm
a life-long democrat.

34:23.438 --> 34:26.036
It's about their mindset.
Not mine.

34:26.038 --> 34:27.371
I'm so sorry, madam.

34:27.373 --> 34:29.370
I had to much to drink.

34:29.371 --> 34:32.603
Wine is so delicious. I've
been drinking it like juice.

34:32.605 --> 34:36.405
Oh, Haut Brion 82 is an
incredible expensive juice.

34:38.139 --> 34:41.302
We should go back before the music
ends, don't you think, madam?

34:41.304 --> 34:44.404
No. No. I think that's
enough for tonight.

34:44.406 --> 34:46.571
You just...
You just go to bed.

34:46.572 --> 34:48.069
Won't they wonder
what happened to me?

34:48.071 --> 34:49.469
Oh, let me
take care of that.

34:49.472 --> 34:50.871
Well, see you tomorrow.

34:50.873 --> 34:53.235
Thank you for
everything, Maria.

34:53.237 --> 34:54.239
Okay, madam.

34:56.572 --> 34:58.439
You don't want me help
the others clean up?

34:59.071 --> 35:00.205
No. Not tonight.

35:01.973 --> 35:02.973
See you tomorrow, madam.

35:06.239 --> 35:07.240
Maria?

35:08.873 --> 35:09.874
Yes, madam?

35:11.305 --> 35:12.973
You look beautiful
with lipstick on.

35:14.371 --> 35:15.372
Thank you, madam.

35:59.306 --> 36:00.403
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

36:00.405 --> 36:01.470
Hit harder.

36:02.705 --> 36:03.771
Come on.
Upsy daisy.

36:03.773 --> 36:04.973
- I can't.
- Upsy daisy.

36:07.805 --> 36:08.906
God you stink.

36:10.139 --> 36:12.202
This is
outrageous behavior.

36:12.204 --> 36:13.370
Okay. Okay.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.873
Hey, hey,
look. Look.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.037
Thirteen at the table.
And...

36:18.039 --> 36:19.336
Yes.

36:19.338 --> 36:21.403
Because of Judas.
Thirteen... That's...

36:21.405 --> 36:22.772
That's way it's bad luck.

36:23.472 --> 36:24.473
Where's Maria?

36:25.539 --> 36:27.069
Gone to bed.

36:27.071 --> 36:28.806
She was the belle of the ball.

36:36.273 --> 36:37.603
I want him
out of here.

36:37.605 --> 36:38.936
He almost ruined
the whole evening.

36:38.938 --> 36:40.404
But he didn't.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.404
And Maria. God,
I was a nervous wreck.

36:42.406 --> 36:43.540
Did you see
those shoes?

36:45.104 --> 36:48.436
You know what?
Everyone loved her.

36:48.438 --> 36:50.202
Don't ever do that
to me again, okay?

36:50.204 --> 36:51.636
You put me in
a horrible position...

36:51.638 --> 36:54.370
Hey. You improvised.

36:54.372 --> 36:56.638
You pulled it off.
Congratulations.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.070
David Morgan was
flat-out flirting with her.

36:59.072 --> 37:00.370
What's up with that?

37:00.372 --> 37:03.437
Chill. Chill.
Congratulations, I said.

37:03.439 --> 37:04.440
Hey!

38:13.306 --> 38:14.636
Hello?

38:14.638 --> 38:16.370
<i>Hi Steven,
it's David Morgan.</i>

38:16.372 --> 38:17.939
Sorry, <i>bonjour.</i>

38:19.572 --> 38:21.204
I think.

38:21.206 --> 38:23.326
<i>You couldn't give me
Maria's number, could you?</i>

38:27.372 --> 38:28.372
Um...

38:30.372 --> 38:31.773
Yeah, yes sure.

38:32.472 --> 38:34.104
Stay on the phone.

38:34.106 --> 38:36.270
I just get her number
for you now.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.037
Okay. Hold on.
Hang on. Yeah.

38:39.039 --> 38:42.803
Maria? Note down your
phone number for me.

38:42.805 --> 38:43.905
Note it down quick.

38:45.938 --> 38:47.239
I'll pay you extra.

38:53.371 --> 38:54.372
Thank you.

38:55.271 --> 38:56.272
Hello?

38:57.904 --> 38:59.869
Yeah, I have it here. Yeah.

38:59.871 --> 39:07.571
689-139-134.

39:07.573 --> 39:10.703
Yeah. Yeah, I will. I'll
tell him you said thank you.

39:10.705 --> 39:11.970
Yeah. Okay. Bye bye.

39:11.972 --> 39:12.972
Hey, Dad,

39:13.772 --> 39:14.869
guess what?

39:14.871 --> 39:15.872
What?

39:17.305 --> 39:18.473
Ah... Nothing.

39:19.971 --> 39:22.305
I just had a bad dream.
That's all.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.303
What about
your French lesson?

39:43.038 --> 39:44.472
Stop it, okay?

39:45.805 --> 39:47.270
I'm doing this
for you, remember?

39:47.272 --> 39:49.036
You're not learning
French for me anymore.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.539
That's plain enough. Sean!
Give Maria back her phone.

39:52.638 --> 39:54.538
"Let me be direct.

39:54.540 --> 39:56.103
"You are amazing.

39:56.105 --> 39:58.637
"Very cool but
red hot too.

39:58.639 --> 40:01.772
"May I see you again?
Text yes or yes. David M."

40:02.572 --> 40:03.573
What?

40:05.138 --> 40:07.872
It's a wrong number, madam,
no one ever text me.

40:10.205 --> 40:11.770
It's David Morgan.

40:11.772 --> 40:12.772
You're kidding?

40:13.472 --> 40:15.037
He's kidding.

40:15.039 --> 40:17.037
"Excellent. I felt something
the moment we met."

40:17.039 --> 40:19.136
My God!
I knew it.

40:19.138 --> 40:21.437
This is because
of you. And you.

40:21.439 --> 40:23.103
The Oscar
goes to Maria.

40:23.105 --> 40:25.136
Here somebody take this I
think I'm going to throw up.

40:25.138 --> 40:26.606
Good luck, Maria.

40:28.739 --> 40:30.203
Maria...

40:30.205 --> 40:31.639
This is not funny,
Bob. Shut up.

40:35.039 --> 40:38.637
Did something happen at the dinner?
Something specific?

40:38.639 --> 40:40.539
No, madam.
Nothing specific.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.538
He didn't play
footsie with you?

40:43.540 --> 40:45.237
Footsie?
What is that?

40:45.239 --> 40:46.640
What?
You know. Like...

40:48.039 --> 40:51.204
No, madam.

40:51.206 --> 40:53.403
He didn't touch you somewhere?
Or make you touch him?

40:53.405 --> 40:54.636
No, madam.

40:54.638 --> 40:55.998
Oh, God, So what is
this all about?

40:56.805 --> 40:59.373
What? There was
something I must say.

40:59.938 --> 41:01.736
What thing?

41:01.738 --> 41:03.778
I don't know. I felt something
when he looked at me.

41:04.472 --> 41:05.970
Yes,
the Haut Brion.

41:05.972 --> 41:09.537
The thing you felt inside was drunk, Maria.
Nothing else.

41:09.539 --> 41:11.179
Here I'm going to help
you get rid of him.

41:11.739 --> 41:13.303
What is this cell?
Nokia?

41:13.305 --> 41:15.136
You keep it for
sentimental reasons?

41:15.138 --> 41:16.971
I'm going to get you
a new iPhone

41:16.973 --> 41:18.939
for putting up with
David's insanity.

41:20.373 --> 41:23.373
Be kind please, do not insist.
There.

41:25.072 --> 41:26.769
I beat Rose.

41:26.771 --> 41:28.936
Yeah, barely,
I got an eight.

41:28.938 --> 41:31.102
Oh, how great you
are my little stars.

41:31.104 --> 41:33.770
But you weren't even watching
me, you were talking to Maria.

41:33.772 --> 41:35.737
Look I tagged you
all over my Instagram.

41:35.739 --> 41:36.970
How many likes
did I get?

41:36.972 --> 41:38.605
Now go collect
your clubs. Go on now.

41:40.739 --> 41:42.537
Oh!

41:42.539 --> 41:44.739
Meet me at the
Georges V at 9:00.

41:45.738 --> 41:47.237
Oh, my God.
I am an idiot.

41:47.239 --> 41:50.136
He's excited
by your resistance.

41:50.138 --> 41:52.103
He wants you
in his bed.

41:52.105 --> 41:54.636
But I thought the Georges
V was the movie theater

41:54.638 --> 41:56.137
on the Champs Elysees,
madam?

41:56.139 --> 41:57.972
No, no. Not in this context.
It's a hotel.

41:58.971 --> 42:00.869
Georges V hotel.

42:00.871 --> 42:01.872
A hotel.

42:03.738 --> 42:06.873
Steven! Steven!
Stop fucking around, Steven.

42:11.206 --> 42:13.037
I'll turn you
into a frog.

42:13.039 --> 42:14.803
Oh, no!

42:14.805 --> 42:17.936
Okay. I'll turn you into a
princess but only until midnight.

42:17.938 --> 42:18.939
Then poof!

42:20.039 --> 42:21.406
Abracadabra!

42:26.604 --> 42:29.340
I don't trust her. I think we
should tell David the truth.

42:29.938 --> 42:32.404
No. Not yet anyways.

42:32.406 --> 42:34.070
What do you mean
not yet?

42:34.072 --> 42:36.569
Wait until he
verified the painting.

42:36.571 --> 42:38.905
I don't want him thinking
we're a house full of liars.

42:39.538 --> 42:40.538
God forbid.

42:41.704 --> 42:43.472
It's a real
Caravaggio, Anne.

42:44.439 --> 42:45.771
Don't muddy the waters.

43:21.905 --> 43:23.535
<i>What are
we going to see?</i>

43:23.537 --> 43:25.239
A horror movie,
of course,

43:26.138 --> 43:27.738
so you jump
into my arms.

43:29.405 --> 43:32.070
Madam. Anne,
our friend

43:32.072 --> 43:34.873
she thought it was
the Georges V hotel.

43:37.373 --> 43:39.772
Anne does not know the
first thing about romance.

43:43.605 --> 43:46.539
Listen, Maria, there's something I
must tell you straight off the bat.

43:48.038 --> 43:49.039
I know who you are.

43:50.939 --> 43:54.273
What I mean is I know
who you really are.

43:57.638 --> 43:59.470
Somebody told me
at the party.

43:59.472 --> 44:01.269
I promised
I wouldn't say who.

44:01.271 --> 44:02.936
Oh, my God.
It was Steven.

44:02.938 --> 44:04.103
He wasn't supposed...

44:04.105 --> 44:05.538
Listen.
It's all right.

44:07.139 --> 44:08.139
I don't care.

44:10.038 --> 44:11.571
It makes
no difference to me.

44:12.239 --> 44:13.239
Really?

44:13.737 --> 44:14.738
Yeah.

44:16.705 --> 44:17.972
You honestly
feel that way?

44:20.972 --> 44:24.036
And I have a daughter.
Did he tell you that?

44:24.038 --> 44:25.438
A princess,
I'm sure.

44:27.438 --> 44:31.138
The topic, <i>mi amor,</i>
is closed.

44:51.406 --> 44:53.273
You know they were
supposed to destroy them?

44:54.938 --> 44:56.404
It was a big scandal
at the time.

44:58.305 --> 45:00.570
Like everything new.

45:00.572 --> 45:03.605
People are afraid when they can't
link a feeling with another one.

45:05.438 --> 45:07.270
And how do you
feel right now?

45:07.272 --> 45:08.273
Empty.

45:09.905 --> 45:10.906
Let's make a wish.

45:39.204 --> 45:41.269
Are you okay?
You look sad?

45:44.638 --> 45:47.371
Your mother's never been
so happy in all her life.

45:47.871 --> 45:49.403
<i>Okay.</i>

45:49.405 --> 45:53.070
Now, I will pop this in FedEx.
You will have it by Thursday.

45:53.072 --> 45:54.873
<i>I wish you could
come and see me.</i>

45:58.371 --> 45:59.372
<i>Look.</i>

46:06.404 --> 46:07.802
Ah.

46:07.804 --> 46:09.403
Where were you?

46:09.405 --> 46:11.937
Oh, you know, doing a little
shopping at the Galerie Lafayette.

46:11.939 --> 46:13.304
Are you okay?

46:13.306 --> 46:16.570
I'm fine. Just
starving, that's all.

46:16.572 --> 46:19.371
Maria just asked me if she could go.
She just left.

46:20.805 --> 46:23.069
Mandy is with the kids.

46:23.071 --> 46:24.870
Did she have
make up on?

46:24.872 --> 46:26.404
Lipstick? A skirt?

46:26.904 --> 46:28.502
Excuse me?

46:28.504 --> 46:30.904
There's something very strange
going on with Maria. Trust me.

46:31.972 --> 46:34.270
Okay, can you tell me
about it over steak?

46:34.272 --> 46:35.803
There's this nice bistro
on the corner.

46:35.805 --> 46:36.970
She is seeing him, Bob.

46:36.972 --> 46:38.270
This morning
she came late

46:38.272 --> 46:39.569
and she looked like
she'd been fucking.

46:39.571 --> 46:41.137
Oh, my God!

46:42.705 --> 46:44.271
- I'm coming!
- Come on, Bob.

46:44.273 --> 46:46.237
Oh, my God. I'd hate to
see if there was a fire.

46:46.239 --> 46:48.102
- You move like a tortoise.
- Yeah.

46:48.104 --> 46:50.471
Oh, my God!
Okay. Let's follow her.

46:52.771 --> 46:55.770
Come on. Turn it on.
Let's go now. Drive fast.

46:55.772 --> 46:59.302
Be like the French. Go!
Go! Go! Go! Oh, my God!

46:59.304 --> 47:00.403
Shut up.

47:00.405 --> 47:01.806
Do not talk to me
that way.

47:11.805 --> 47:14.905
You're parking. Go
around the block. Fast. Go.

47:22.072 --> 47:24.039
<i>- Bonsoir, Monsieur</i> Morgan.
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>

47:34.771 --> 47:35.872
It's nice, no?

47:41.471 --> 47:45.468
Oh, please, he can't be serious.
Look, Bob, he's taking her to

47:45.470 --> 47:46.869
the <i>Petit Bistro d'Auteuil.</i>

47:46.871 --> 47:49.636
Obviously.
I'm not blind.

47:49.638 --> 47:52.903
- That's one of my favorite restaurants.
- I mean...

47:52.905 --> 47:54.039
At least it's food.

47:56.537 --> 47:59.369
Can we go back home now?
You can fire her tomorrow.

47:59.371 --> 48:02.202
I can't fire her. She run's
the house like clockwork.

48:02.204 --> 48:04.569
Well, you trained her.

48:04.571 --> 48:08.104
She's not a biochemist.
She's just a housemaid.

48:08.106 --> 48:10.936
Look. You don't get it. It takes,
you know, at least half a day

48:10.938 --> 48:12.903
to learn how to fold
my skirts alone,

48:12.905 --> 48:14.635
you know, I mean,
it's a mess.

48:14.637 --> 48:16.103
It's a total
fucking mess.

48:16.105 --> 48:17.636
I think you're
overreacting.

48:17.638 --> 48:19.202
But I'll talk to her.

48:19.204 --> 48:21.635
Could he be in love with her?
Is that possible?

48:21.637 --> 48:23.304
Well admit it,
she's got a great ass.

48:24.705 --> 48:26.936
Maybe vacuum cleaning's
the new Pilates.

48:26.938 --> 48:28.138
She's terribly ugly.
Right?

48:29.139 --> 48:30.269
I don't know.

48:30.271 --> 48:32.602
She's got
a kind of charm.

48:32.604 --> 48:35.802
Oh, my God.
Now you too.

48:35.804 --> 48:37.969
How about we both go in
there and have our dinner?

48:37.971 --> 48:39.039
Because they would see us.

48:40.537 --> 48:42.201
She's the guilty one,
not us.

48:42.203 --> 48:43.204
Bob.

48:45.570 --> 48:46.571
It's good.

48:47.905 --> 48:49.303
You see.

48:49.305 --> 48:50.606
Everything's new to you.

48:52.138 --> 48:53.538
You're like
a kid, Maria.

48:55.039 --> 48:59.470
And you have
a play date after dinner

48:59.472 --> 49:02.073
You realize I'm a fervent
believer, David?

49:02.872 --> 49:04.737
Oh, I know.

49:04.739 --> 49:07.470
I hear you calling for God
when you're in bed with me.

49:07.472 --> 49:11.571
Maybe, yeah, I am a kid.
But you, you're a teenager.

49:12.872 --> 49:13.906
Oversexed.

49:14.604 --> 49:15.772
In the worst way.

49:17.237 --> 49:18.703
I'll have you know,

49:18.705 --> 49:21.568
when I was a teenager,
I was going to be a priest.

49:21.570 --> 49:23.403
- Oh, my God.
- You see.

49:23.405 --> 49:26.369
You're doing it again.
Calling his name.

49:26.371 --> 49:27.738
I'm starting to
get jealous, Maria.

49:29.939 --> 49:33.037
It's like
a slow motion car crash.

49:33.039 --> 49:34.803
I've never seen you
this way.

49:34.805 --> 49:37.470
Well, it's like my own
little catastrophe.

49:37.472 --> 49:40.236
She know the color of our underwear.
She cleans our sheets.

49:40.238 --> 49:42.973
She knows when we have sex.
She knows when I throw up.

49:44.371 --> 49:45.636
You're still
throwing up?

49:45.638 --> 49:47.236
Well, not in a major way.

49:47.238 --> 49:50.105
I just want to stay,
you know, sexy.

49:51.938 --> 49:53.302
Hang on.

49:53.304 --> 49:54.305
What are you doing?

49:54.805 --> 49:56.368
Hunting.

49:56.370 --> 49:57.739
Hunting for what?

49:58.404 --> 50:00.906
God, it's not 1878.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.301
I wanted to
send you flowers.

50:09.303 --> 50:11.302
What kind of flowers?

50:11.304 --> 50:13.205
Well, give me an address
and you'll find out.

50:16.205 --> 50:17.472
Don't be afraid
of me, Maria.

50:19.405 --> 50:21.105
You and your family,
I give you my word.

50:22.605 --> 50:24.572
Complete and
utter discretion.

50:26.304 --> 50:30.805
Meanwhile...
A gift for you.

50:38.404 --> 50:39.938
Oh, my God.

50:41.472 --> 50:43.069
I can't accept.
They are...

50:43.071 --> 50:45.805
Perfect.
For your hair.

50:47.105 --> 50:48.105
For your eyes.

50:50.070 --> 50:52.137
For your tattoo
my white princess.

50:56.370 --> 50:58.738
That's it. I'm going to
have to tell him the truth.

50:59.405 --> 51:00.869
Don't.

51:00.871 --> 51:02.902
He'll think we were
making fun of him.

51:02.904 --> 51:04.070
I can not afford that.

51:04.072 --> 51:05.706
Come on. Do we have
any money problems?

51:06.304 --> 51:08.870
Absolutely not.

51:08.872 --> 51:13.802
But <i>Monsieur</i> Antoine Bernard and
his museum must have a Caravaggio.

51:13.804 --> 51:15.635
I'm only
too happy to oblige.

51:15.637 --> 51:16.877
That is if it is
the real thing.

51:21.104 --> 51:23.870
We pocket
a kings ransom.

51:23.872 --> 51:25.372
So keep your mouth shout.

51:44.371 --> 51:46.470
Finally,
Doctor Schwiman.

51:46.472 --> 51:49.536
Are you all right? I saw your
text about an emergency.

51:49.538 --> 51:51.802
<i>No, I'm not all right.
I'm about to kill that woman.</i>

51:51.804 --> 51:53.769
What's happening?
You in bed?

51:53.771 --> 51:54.969
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

51:54.971 --> 51:56.737
Well, it's the middle of
the night for you.

51:56.739 --> 51:58.902
<i>Are you going to listen or
just make stupid remarks?</i>

51:58.904 --> 52:00.235
<i>It's the middle
of the night.</i>

52:00.237 --> 52:01.535
See.

52:01.537 --> 52:02.938
<i>Well, if you'd
call back sooner.</i>

52:04.037 --> 52:05.235
<i>Hello, doctor.</i>

52:05.237 --> 52:06.468
<i>Hello, Bob.</i>

52:06.470 --> 52:08.638
Bob, this is
a private consultation.

52:09.938 --> 52:10.939
Please.

52:14.739 --> 52:18.036
Okay. I just...

52:18.038 --> 52:24.302
I mean, you know, I've had to fight my whole
entire life for everything, even men.

52:24.304 --> 52:29.204
How can this woman, this this
maid inspire such feelings?

52:30.470 --> 52:31.735
<i>Go on.</i>

52:31.737 --> 52:32.805
I feel so alone.

52:34.638 --> 52:38.536
You know, even in a crowded room.
I fell lonely, doctor.

52:38.538 --> 52:40.572
Are you serious?

52:56.739 --> 52:58.072
Tell me the truth, Maria.

53:00.971 --> 53:03.069
What is your secret dream?

53:03.071 --> 53:04.271
Everyone's got
a secret dream.

53:05.572 --> 53:07.239
I gave up on dreams you know.

53:08.138 --> 53:09.572
I have simple desires.

53:11.371 --> 53:13.135
I want my daughter
to be happy.

53:13.137 --> 53:15.202
Oh, tell the truth come on.

53:15.204 --> 53:17.803
Everyone's got a project.
You must have a plan.

53:17.805 --> 53:18.806
Well,

53:21.270 --> 53:23.205
it will sound
ridiculous to you.

53:24.470 --> 53:27.068
Sweetheart,

53:27.070 --> 53:30.770
anything you would say to me will
never ever sound ridiculous.

53:30.772 --> 53:32.304
Come on.
What is it?

53:33.771 --> 53:37.305
I would like to invent the
half pack of baking powder.

53:39.437 --> 53:40.535
Baking powder?

53:40.537 --> 53:42.870
Yes. I cook
a lot, you see

53:42.872 --> 53:47.135
and no recipe uses the whole
packet of baking powder. None.

53:47.137 --> 53:49.269
It's always half
of the packet.

53:49.271 --> 53:51.403
Then you leave
the rest in the cupboard.

53:51.405 --> 53:53.537
But you don't use it
never again

53:53.539 --> 53:56.202
because you're afraid
it got spoiled.

53:56.204 --> 53:58.935
Or you're not sure if it's
a real half remaining there,

53:58.937 --> 54:01.368
perhaps more, perhaps it's
less, you know what I mean?

54:01.370 --> 54:03.271
Yeah, yeah, I get
the point. It's...

54:04.437 --> 54:05.536
It's very smart.

54:05.538 --> 54:06.606
Very smart.

54:07.937 --> 54:09.602
You're a very
unusual woman, Maria.

54:09.604 --> 54:11.537
Yes, I am.

54:11.539 --> 54:13.269
Maybe you could
cook for me sometime?

54:13.271 --> 54:14.905
Invite me back
to your place.

54:15.938 --> 54:18.035
You have
that Velazquez.

54:18.037 --> 54:19.605
I could come and
prize it for you.

54:22.037 --> 54:23.935
You could take me
to Madrid.

54:23.937 --> 54:26.069
I could meet
your family.

54:26.071 --> 54:27.570
I'm brilliant
at graveling.

54:29.104 --> 54:32.069
<i>Buenos noches.</i>

54:59.970 --> 55:02.269
<i>Bonsoir, monsier.</i>

55:02.271 --> 55:05.438
<i>Bonsoir. Bonsoir.</i>

55:14.704 --> 55:15.705
Wow.

55:19.038 --> 55:20.269
What's with the outfit?

55:20.271 --> 55:22.201
Well, it was
doctor Schwiman's idea.

55:22.203 --> 55:25.539
It's an exercise to expunge my anger.
Against Maria.

55:28.936 --> 55:29.937
Are you jealous?

55:30.638 --> 55:32.072
Oh, God, stop it.

55:36.037 --> 55:38.137
Anne, you're
a beautiful woman

55:39.471 --> 55:41.103
but that's not why
I married you.

55:41.105 --> 55:43.369
Am I not pretty anymore?

55:43.371 --> 55:47.403
I think you're jealous
because you're insecure.

55:47.405 --> 55:49.736
Of course, I am.
We never have sex.

55:49.738 --> 55:51.869
The world is full of
young pretty women.

55:51.871 --> 55:53.072
And Paris is the worst.

55:53.970 --> 55:55.069
Shhh...

55:55.071 --> 55:56.238
Don't shush me.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.471
We have doctors
orders don't we?

56:21.405 --> 56:23.635
I must get this.

56:31.769 --> 56:34.303
<i>Bob, the bank is
breathing down my neck.</i>

56:34.305 --> 56:36.236
<i>Their accounts are running low.
This is it.</i>

56:36.238 --> 56:38.604
<i>We really need
the money from the painting.</i>

56:38.606 --> 56:42.069
How much time do I have?

56:42.071 --> 56:44.435
<i>A month maybe before
the foreclosure begins.</i>

56:44.437 --> 56:46.235
<i>I can't do anything else
without you here.</i>

57:40.203 --> 57:41.204
How was your evening?

57:42.270 --> 57:43.969
You scared me, madam.

57:43.971 --> 57:45.370
Is everyone okay?

57:45.372 --> 57:46.603
You're never up
so early.

57:46.605 --> 57:47.936
How would you know?

57:47.938 --> 57:50.868
Well... Sorry. I'm going
to get breakfast ready.

57:50.870 --> 57:52.204
What's in that bag,
Maria?

57:53.138 --> 57:54.138
In this one, madam?

57:54.670 --> 57:55.868
Exactly.

57:55.870 --> 57:58.435
It's a dress from
the dry cleaners, madam.

57:58.437 --> 58:00.236
Mmm.

58:00.238 --> 58:02.101
They gave it back to you like
that with no hanger, no plastic?

58:02.103 --> 58:04.935
It's for the dry cleaner. I wanted to
take it yesterday but it was closed.

58:04.937 --> 58:06.603
Really?

58:06.605 --> 58:08.470
You just said you picked it
up from the dry cleaners.

58:08.472 --> 58:10.735
Sometimes I get confused
because of my English, madam.

58:10.737 --> 58:12.236
Oh, no.

58:12.238 --> 58:13.771
Your English is perfect.

58:14.804 --> 58:15.901
Let me see the dress.

58:15.903 --> 58:16.969
This is the one...

58:16.971 --> 58:17.971
Give me the dress, Maria.

58:19.770 --> 58:20.771
Yes, madam.

58:23.071 --> 58:24.436
It's dirty, madam.

58:24.438 --> 58:26.036
It belongs at
the dry cleaners.

58:26.038 --> 58:27.635
No.

58:27.637 --> 58:29.805
It belongs to me. But I
haven't worn it in months.

58:31.272 --> 58:33.872
And it smells like you with
your cheap vanilla perfume.

58:35.572 --> 58:36.802
I don't smell anything.

58:39.537 --> 58:40.905
I trusted you, Maria.

58:41.703 --> 58:42.935
I sat you at my table.

58:42.937 --> 58:44.105
I thought you
were honest.

58:47.238 --> 58:50.068
Just so I know, do you wear my underwear
when he takes you to the hotel?

58:50.070 --> 58:51.903
I don't understand,
madam.

58:51.905 --> 58:53.868
You know I hate it
when people cry.

58:53.870 --> 58:55.734
I'm so sorry.

58:55.736 --> 58:58.802
Just hurry up. The kids are
going to be late for school.

58:58.804 --> 59:00.136
I'm so sorry, madam.

59:00.138 --> 59:01.637
I don't know
what to say.

59:02.771 --> 59:04.801
I'm in love. And...

59:04.803 --> 59:06.538
Please just stop it!

59:07.570 --> 59:10.269
Okay. I am not
your friend.

59:10.271 --> 59:13.402
Try to put an end
to this nonsense.

59:13.404 --> 59:17.637
I'm advising you to think of what's
important for you and your daughter.

59:18.905 --> 59:19.905
Yes, madam.

59:20.937 --> 59:21.938
How is she by the way?

59:23.071 --> 59:24.605
Still very well.
Thanks, madam.

59:26.371 --> 59:29.369
She's got the free style
finals coming up.

59:29.371 --> 59:32.872
Good. Well, I'm really proud to
pay for such a nice girl study.

59:36.637 --> 59:37.638
Really.

59:39.305 --> 59:41.105
I'd hate to have to
be forced to stop.

59:44.070 --> 59:45.071
Yes, madam.

01:00:00.105 --> 01:00:03.568
Stop with this phone.
He will not call.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.903
We do not belong
to this world.

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:07.268
He knows who I am.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:11.569
He doesn't know.
But the world does.

01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:13.103
Is that a Filipino saying?

01:00:13.105 --> 01:00:16.235
Maria, we serve,
they eat.

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:19.102
They don't love
people like you or me.

01:00:19.104 --> 01:00:21.370
We're slaves.
Same as slaves.

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:23.702
How can you say
such things, Mandy?

01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:25.402
Are you crazy?

01:00:25.404 --> 01:00:27.201
I'm worth as
much as madam.

01:00:27.203 --> 01:00:29.569
Even if I bring
her tea on a tray.

01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:31.068
We are human beings.

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.368
You better
respect yourself.

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.934
We work
for our kids.

01:00:34.936 --> 01:00:36.702
They will be
strong at study.

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:38.736
But what does
this have to do with love?

01:00:38.738 --> 01:00:40.103
Everything.

01:00:40.105 --> 01:00:42.403
There's no such
thing as love.

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.535
Clean.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:18.868
You're showing me the best baker in
Paris as if you know better than I would.

01:01:21.871 --> 01:01:24.035
- Is that right?
- Perfect.

01:01:24.037 --> 01:01:25.371
Let me order
something else.

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:34.968
How do you say
Lemon tart?

01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:38.468
<i>Non, non, non, non.</i>
We don't, we stop.

01:02:09.103 --> 01:02:14.036
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

01:02:14.038 --> 01:02:15.272
Happy birthday sweetie.

01:02:17.138 --> 01:02:18.602
Bravo!
Let's play kids.

01:02:18.604 --> 01:02:19.905
Yeah!

01:02:21.803 --> 01:02:23.903
So...

01:02:23.905 --> 01:02:25.634
What do you think?
Boy or a girl?

01:02:25.636 --> 01:02:27.135
Well,
Let me see.

01:02:27.137 --> 01:02:29.104
You're trying to play
a trick on me here.

01:02:31.137 --> 01:02:33.135
I can feel.

01:02:33.137 --> 01:02:34.801
There's twins
in there, no?

01:02:34.803 --> 01:02:35.969
Oh, my God!

01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:37.069
It's unbelievable.

01:02:37.071 --> 01:02:38.636
I told you she was amazing.

01:02:38.638 --> 01:02:40.469
When there is two I can not
tell if there is boy or a girl.

01:02:40.471 --> 01:02:42.303
Isn't it better
than ultrasound.

01:02:42.305 --> 01:02:44.138
One of you is worried.

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:46.804
One of you is in love.

01:02:47.703 --> 01:02:49.303
You don't have to worry.

01:02:49.305 --> 01:02:51.735
He's going to call and ask
you away for the weekend.

01:02:51.737 --> 01:02:53.704
Finally, Georges Clooney
is going to call me.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:55.836
What else?

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:58.467
Well, you should go.
You should say yes.

01:02:58.469 --> 01:03:02.601
Life wasn't always nice to you and
will not always be so enjoy now.

01:03:02.603 --> 01:03:04.236
I don't know who
she's talking to

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.469
but one of you is going
to have a nice weekend.

01:03:05.471 --> 01:03:07.135
Maybe it's you.

01:03:07.137 --> 01:03:10.435
The woman I'm talking about
knows exactly who she is.

01:03:10.437 --> 01:03:12.702
Should we open
the presents, madam?

01:03:12.704 --> 01:03:14.204
Are you drunk, Maria?

01:04:46.704 --> 01:04:48.638
You Americans and guns.
We can't fight it.

01:04:50.638 --> 01:04:52.202
Well,

01:04:52.204 --> 01:04:54.935
they give us guns at ten so
we're not tempted to play with

01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:56.537
the toy pistol
between our legs.

01:04:57.204 --> 01:04:58.204
And does it work?

01:04:59.636 --> 01:05:00.637
The guilt works.

01:05:02.138 --> 01:05:04.705
I always have a little
guilt when I'm having sex.

01:05:05.904 --> 01:05:07.404
How delicious
that must be.

01:05:09.037 --> 01:05:10.270
You must tell me
all about it.

01:05:33.403 --> 01:05:34.538
<i>Et voila.</i>

01:05:36.904 --> 01:05:38.371
Oh, it's so beautiful.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:40.470
Is it a hotel?

01:05:41.236 --> 01:05:42.637
No, my dear.
It is not.

01:05:47.536 --> 01:05:49.470
I want you to witness
my big announcement.

01:05:50.404 --> 01:05:51.802
Check.

01:05:51.804 --> 01:05:52.871
I'm going
to get you.

01:05:57.403 --> 01:05:58.869
What has got
into you?

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:02.036
Let's have sex.
Or let's run away.

01:06:02.038 --> 01:06:03.502
We can have
sex tonight.

01:06:03.504 --> 01:06:05.770
And we can run away tomorrow.
Now, come on.

01:06:07.438 --> 01:06:09.468
What I like about
chess is the vision.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:12.404
You know where you're going.
But nobody else has a clue.

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:16.471
There is no such thing
as vision in chess.

01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:18.638
Only options.

01:06:20.403 --> 01:06:24.567
Well, I have my own little
shortcuts, my little lucky tricks.

01:06:24.569 --> 01:06:26.134
Lay there for a minute
and smell the flowers.

01:06:26.136 --> 01:06:27.271
What is going on?

01:06:28.604 --> 01:06:29.871
I can't go in there.

01:06:32.938 --> 01:06:34.135
Are you ashamed of me?

01:06:34.137 --> 01:06:35.203
Of course not.

01:06:35.903 --> 01:06:37.868
David,
you know me.

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:39.768
You know who I am.

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:42.237
I can not mix with these people.
I can't.

01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:45.538
Darling, Maria.

01:06:46.638 --> 01:06:49.069
It is the 21st century,

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:51.704
Queen Elizabeth has
dinner with Jay Z.

01:06:53.135 --> 01:06:54.601
Come on, let's go.

01:06:54.603 --> 01:06:59.302
Stefan Zweig said that
he loved chess because

01:06:59.304 --> 01:07:01.905
it had nothing
to do with luck.

01:07:04.136 --> 01:07:05.971
Maria! Maria!

01:07:07.938 --> 01:07:10.701
They're going to be caught
believe me.

01:07:10.703 --> 01:07:12.237
- Maria!
- Maria!

01:07:13.303 --> 01:07:15.201
Ah!

01:07:15.203 --> 01:07:17.363
You're amazing. Does every
child in the world love you?

01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:20.070
Let's play.

01:07:23.304 --> 01:07:25.769
Gentlemen, if I can have
your attention please,

01:07:25.771 --> 01:07:27.434
I bring news
from London.

01:07:27.436 --> 01:07:29.968
Your painting has
been authentified.

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:31.435
Hallelujah.

01:07:31.437 --> 01:07:32.972
Congratulations,
<i>mon vieux.</i>

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:35.071
Thank you.

01:07:44.437 --> 01:07:46.404
We have many things
to celebrate today.

01:07:48.904 --> 01:07:50.204
First, our friendship.

01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:52.103
To our wives.

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.702
To our families.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:56.568
And let's not forget,

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:58.903
Michelangelo
Merisi da Caravaggio.

01:07:58.905 --> 01:08:00.234
That rogue.

01:08:00.236 --> 01:08:01.871
A master fornicator.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:03.904
At least he had fun.

01:08:06.203 --> 01:08:07.736
Taste it.

01:08:07.738 --> 01:08:11.104
It's one of the greatest wines
in the world. Bourgogne.

01:08:12.404 --> 01:08:15.938
To life.

01:08:16.737 --> 01:08:18.969
Thank you.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:22.969
They are both with the nice Portuguese
nanny going down for a nap.

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.571
Thank you so much.

01:08:25.103 --> 01:08:26.301
Oh, my gosh,

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:28.768
you must have the magic touch.
Shazam.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.201
Maria,
tell us about yourself.

01:08:31.203 --> 01:08:33.571
The mysterious woman
who stole David's heart.

01:08:34.937 --> 01:08:36.568
Or his liver.

01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:38.368
His heart is
difficult to steal.

01:08:40.236 --> 01:08:43.033
Yeah, my heart is easy to
steal but it's hard to hold.

01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:44.769
I'm Irish, after all.

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:47.600
When did the Irish become experts
in the affairs of heart?

01:08:47.603 --> 01:08:49.437
They're supposed
to be happy drunks.

01:08:50.738 --> 01:08:52.202
The French do adultery.

01:08:52.203 --> 01:08:54.367
And the English do
spanky, spanky.

01:08:54.368 --> 01:08:56.068
And the Americans,

01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:58.201
they have sex like they're
invading a third world country

01:08:58.203 --> 01:08:59.602
and didn't have to
pay for it afterwords.

01:08:59.604 --> 01:09:01.401
I can explain it.

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:05.234
In France we choose adultery so we can
stay married to our beloved wives.

01:09:05.237 --> 01:09:09.368
The English, well, after 20
years of getting punished

01:09:09.371 --> 01:09:11.234
in boarding schools,

01:09:11.236 --> 01:09:13.734
fighting their
homosexual feelings,

01:09:13.737 --> 01:09:15.902
they only have the guts
to speak to one girl.

01:09:15.904 --> 01:09:18.104
That's it. They're
settled for life.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:20.872
What do you think, Maria?

01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:24.868
Oh, well, I am an
old fashion Spanish.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:28.469
I do believe marriage is
an important matter.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.367
So you don't lie to anyone?

01:09:30.368 --> 01:09:31.634
Interesting.

01:09:31.636 --> 01:09:33.269
She's adorable.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:34.768
It's like you're from the
19th century or something.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.069
Because you think women
were pure back then?

01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:38.368
Did you ever read
a book, David?

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.267
Yes, I'm nearly finished
coloring it in.

01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:42.737
Seriously. Vice has
been around since,

01:09:43.537 --> 01:09:45.202
human beings themselves.

01:09:45.203 --> 01:09:47.604
And made it an excuse
to invent virtue.

01:09:48.804 --> 01:09:51.537
So, Anne, tell me.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.636
How did you meet Maria?

01:09:53.638 --> 01:09:54.735
She won't tell me.

01:09:54.737 --> 01:09:56.635
Oh, no.

01:09:56.637 --> 01:09:59.435
These two are very secretive
about their friendship.

01:09:59.437 --> 01:10:01.102
I don't even
know when they met.

01:10:01.104 --> 01:10:02.805
Why such a mystery?

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:07.203
I am their maid.

01:10:09.936 --> 01:10:13.237
I have been cleaning their
underwear and their toilets.

01:10:14.404 --> 01:10:18.471
For about, what,
ten years now, madam?

01:10:21.902 --> 01:10:25.067
No, no. We traveled when
we were young together.

01:10:25.069 --> 01:10:27.300
And we ate at all the
finest restaurants.

01:10:27.302 --> 01:10:31.568
Tell me, did you eat at Alain Ducasse's
new restaurant in Italy yet, L'Andana?

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:35.867
Oh, my God, you must absolutely go there.
The meat is amazing.

01:10:35.869 --> 01:10:40.469
How can you eat so much
and stay that thin?

01:10:40.471 --> 01:10:42.104
She was
always like that.

01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:44.402
She was born like that.

01:10:44.404 --> 01:10:46.203
Beautiful. Never ages.

01:10:47.303 --> 01:10:48.900
She's a mystery.

01:10:48.902 --> 01:10:51.602
Thank you, darling.

01:10:51.604 --> 01:10:53.371
When are you going
back to New York?

01:10:53.803 --> 01:10:54.805
Soon.

01:10:56.703 --> 01:10:58.103
Are we...
Are you leaving?

01:10:59.604 --> 01:11:00.605
Yes.

01:11:01.737 --> 01:11:03.435
Fun's over.

01:11:03.437 --> 01:11:05.535
There's an investment bank
in New York I have to kill.

01:11:05.537 --> 01:11:06.967
And I'm going
back to packing.

01:11:06.969 --> 01:11:10.267
I'm taking the kids,
the staff and heading home.

01:11:10.269 --> 01:11:11.749
But that doesn't
change your feelings?

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.471
What's a few miles
between friends.

01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:29.937
Oh, Maria.

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:35.968
Do you realize what a mess we're
in because of your behavior?

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:37.605
I've never asked
for anything, madam.

01:11:39.869 --> 01:11:40.871
He just...

01:11:41.971 --> 01:11:43.603
Well, it's good
you didn't ask.

01:11:43.605 --> 01:11:46.535
You're a housekeeper,
not a prostitute.

01:11:46.537 --> 01:11:49.602
It's not what you
think it is, madam.

01:11:49.604 --> 01:11:51.801
He's deeply
in love with me.

01:11:51.803 --> 01:11:53.637
True love.
He told me.

01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:56.904
The way he holds me
during the night.

01:11:57.903 --> 01:11:59.601
The way he
looks at me.

01:11:59.603 --> 01:12:00.934
Maria,
just listen to me.

01:12:00.936 --> 01:12:02.201
Anne,
I beg you.

01:12:02.203 --> 01:12:04.135
Don't call me Anne.

01:12:04.137 --> 01:12:07.102
You abused my kindness.
And you lied to me.

01:12:07.104 --> 01:12:10.134
I just did what you
asked me to do, madam.

01:12:10.136 --> 01:12:11.767
I sat at
that table.

01:12:11.769 --> 01:12:12.935
Because you
asked me to.

01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:14.535
Look, I don't
want to hurt you.

01:12:14.537 --> 01:12:16.868
I know your life is hard.

01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:18.435
But you're playing
out of your league.

01:12:18.437 --> 01:12:20.434
How do you know?

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.571
How can I explain this without
hurting your feelings.

01:12:24.738 --> 01:12:27.402
This is not your world.

01:12:27.404 --> 01:12:31.135
If your opinions were really
interesting, substantial,

01:12:31.137 --> 01:12:33.804
if they had any impact
or real interest,

01:12:34.703 --> 01:12:35.870
why would you be a maid?

01:12:37.471 --> 01:12:38.967
Because I am a
Spanish immigrant.

01:12:38.969 --> 01:12:40.702
I had no options,
madam.

01:12:40.704 --> 01:12:42.801
Cervantes, El Bulli,

01:12:42.803 --> 01:12:45.100
Almodovar,
Antonio Banderas.

01:12:45.102 --> 01:12:47.142
They're all Spanish and
they're not maids, are they?

01:12:47.803 --> 01:12:49.438
He loves me, madam.

01:12:51.237 --> 01:12:53.403
Perhaps you should
believe in love too.

01:14:21.371 --> 01:14:23.568
You in love.

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:26.235
You sing and
you don't eat.

01:14:26.237 --> 01:14:27.536
I eat.

01:14:27.538 --> 01:14:28.538
Just not so much.

01:14:29.369 --> 01:14:31.437
That's how it starts.

01:14:46.369 --> 01:14:48.535
Filthy genius.
I read it.

01:14:48.537 --> 01:14:49.734
- Uh, ha.
- Tell me it's true?

01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:50.867
It's all true.

01:14:50.869 --> 01:14:52.367
Just like the first one.

01:14:52.369 --> 01:14:54.068
Only this time, it's not
Anne and my father.

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:55.301
It's Anne and the maid.

01:14:55.303 --> 01:14:56.802
Totally cool.

01:14:56.804 --> 01:14:58.104
And you know what?
Political.

01:14:58.802 --> 01:14:59.803
How does it end?

01:15:01.104 --> 01:15:02.104
Who knows?

01:15:02.736 --> 01:15:03.770
Badly.

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:05.371
Join me.

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:24.104
David!

01:15:26.603 --> 01:15:27.700
How are you?

01:15:27.702 --> 01:15:28.704
Hello, Anne.

01:15:30.904 --> 01:15:34.934
This is so funny because I wanted to
organize a double date with my friend.

01:15:34.936 --> 01:15:37.302
Remember the pretty brunette
from our dinner party? Jane.

01:15:37.304 --> 01:15:38.734
Oh, yeah.

01:15:38.736 --> 01:15:40.701
I know. She can seem a little
boring at the beginning

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.202
but she's just
a little lonely.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.867
What with her divorce
and trying to figure out

01:15:43.869 --> 01:15:46.201
what to do with
all her millions.

01:15:46.203 --> 01:15:48.034
I hear she's
a real tornado in bed.

01:15:49.869 --> 01:15:52.635
Anne, I think you're getting me confused
with, with some sort of gigolo.

01:15:52.637 --> 01:15:54.067
I'm just a humble academic.

01:15:54.069 --> 01:15:56.135
I hear you have
other talents.

01:15:56.137 --> 01:15:57.734
Maybe I could take
you out some night.

01:15:57.736 --> 01:16:01.234
Why not, when my beloved
husband is out of town.

01:16:01.236 --> 01:16:03.700
But in the meantime, I'll
get the details from Jane.

01:16:03.702 --> 01:16:05.234
Maria hasn't
already told you?

01:16:05.236 --> 01:16:06.300
Maria?

01:16:06.302 --> 01:16:07.501
Oh, my God.

01:16:07.503 --> 01:16:08.767
I thought that
nightmare was over.

01:16:08.769 --> 01:16:10.234
I feel terrible.
I wanted to call you.

01:16:10.236 --> 01:16:12.901
I just... I thought
things would end quickly.

01:16:12.903 --> 01:16:14.701
I surprised myself
to be honest.

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:18.600
But what can I say.
She beguiles me.

01:16:18.602 --> 01:16:21.633
Look. I held back because
I'm a nice person.

01:16:21.635 --> 01:16:23.202
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:25.201
But should remain
between us.

01:16:25.203 --> 01:16:27.101
Nobody should
be embarrassed.

01:16:33.936 --> 01:16:35.035
I'm so sorry.

01:16:35.037 --> 01:16:36.600
It's so good
to see you.

01:16:36.602 --> 01:16:38.067
I'll call you. Okay.

01:16:38.069 --> 01:16:39.070
Okay.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.936
No!

01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:51.471
Not too tight.

01:16:57.902 --> 01:16:59.003
All done.

01:16:59.437 --> 01:17:00.534
Okay.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.371
No, I'm fine.

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:09.469
Oh, God.

01:17:40.802 --> 01:17:43.770
<i>Hello, you've reached David Morgan.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:17:45.936 --> 01:17:48.370
Hi David.
It's me Maria.

01:17:50.737 --> 01:17:52.937
Nothing.
I hope you're doing well.

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.103
I sent you a message.

01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:00.371
I hope you received them.

01:18:01.236 --> 01:18:02.237
And nothing...

01:18:04.136 --> 01:18:05.137
Call me back.

01:18:08.203 --> 01:18:09.203
Take care.

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:46.234
Maybe something
bad happen to him.

01:18:46.236 --> 01:18:48.235
I don't know,
an accident.

01:18:48.237 --> 01:18:49.635
I know what kind
of accident

01:18:49.637 --> 01:18:51.701
happened to man
that never call back.

01:18:51.703 --> 01:18:53.267
It's an accident
with boobs.

01:18:53.269 --> 01:18:55.034
But it's not possible.

01:18:55.036 --> 01:18:56.733
He was so
in love with me.

01:18:56.735 --> 01:18:59.204
You don't send text.
You wait.

01:19:00.137 --> 01:19:02.300
She's right.
In French we say

01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:04.968
Make him run.

01:19:06.969 --> 01:19:07.970
Which means...

01:19:09.736 --> 01:19:10.737
I don't know.

01:20:06.271 --> 01:20:09.568
No, Bob it's not
very professional.

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:11.237
Quasimodo's not watching.

01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:14.467
Quasimodo would
like this.

01:20:33.204 --> 01:20:34.968
You know, Maria,

01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:38.867
I can feel you're embarrassed
with everything that's happened

01:20:38.869 --> 01:20:41.302
but I want you to know you're
still important in this house.

01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:47.068
I've spoken with Bob and we're
giving you a raise for Christmas.

01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:49.400
Thank you, madam. But it
will not be unnecessary.

01:20:49.402 --> 01:20:51.167
Oh, nonsense.

01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:53.734
Now will you bring tea and cake
for two in the salon, please.

01:20:53.736 --> 01:20:54.737
Yes, madam.

01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:04.901
After all, you've suddenly
got all that wall space.

01:22:04.903 --> 01:22:07.934
I was thinking if you wanted
to stick to the 17th century.

01:22:07.936 --> 01:22:09.437
There is this.

01:22:10.469 --> 01:22:11.967
Oh, it's stunning.

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:13.067
Yeah?

01:22:13.069 --> 01:22:14.968
Oh, it really is.

01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:18.633
But Christie's are having a sale in
London in a couple of weeks time.

01:22:18.635 --> 01:22:21.135
You can go modern maybe
pick up a Delacroix.

01:22:26.235 --> 01:22:28.801
- Oh, my God. It's beautiful.
- Isn't it.

01:22:28.803 --> 01:22:30.468
I don't even
know what to say.

01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:32.368
I have to show Bob.

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:33.868
Oh, is he not here?
Is he away?

01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:35.934
He's at his
French lesson.

01:22:35.936 --> 01:22:38.934
His accent
is hilarious.

01:22:38.936 --> 01:22:42.533
Oh, yeah. Paris has
been great for us.

01:22:42.535 --> 01:22:44.603
We walk like we were
when we first met.

01:22:46.303 --> 01:22:47.403
Congratulations.

01:23:59.069 --> 01:24:00.202
Bye, Steven.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:02.871
Bye, Maria.

01:24:04.136 --> 01:24:05.136
Take care.

01:24:27.903 --> 01:24:29.103
Did you find
your ending?

01:24:30.869 --> 01:24:32.102
I'm not sure yet.

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:36.270
You know something?

01:24:38.637 --> 01:24:40.036
A woman I was
fond of once,

01:24:41.236 --> 01:24:43.102
told me not to
despise people.

01:24:45.469 --> 01:24:47.770
That people love
happy endings.

01:24:49.702 --> 01:24:50.703
They can't fight it.

01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:54.467
The hero runs.

01:24:54.469 --> 01:24:55.871
He kisses her
in the rain.

01:24:59.236 --> 01:25:00.237
People love it.

01:25:05.736 --> 01:25:06.736
Really?

01:25:11.537 --> 01:25:12.537
People.
