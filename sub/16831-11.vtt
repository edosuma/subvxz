WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:01.109
Previously on "Timeless"...

00:01.134 --> 00:03.000
Mr. Mason invented a time machine.

00:03.039 --> 00:05.039
There's room in there
for three passengers.

00:05.064 --> 00:08.038
Rittenhouse knows you've been
tampering with these recorders.

00:08.063 --> 00:10.162
- No, I haven't.
- Whatever the next mission is,

00:10.187 --> 00:11.464
record it properly.

00:11.466 --> 00:13.398
If you don't, I can't
protect you or your family.

00:13.423 --> 00:15.045
Are you telling me that Benedict Arnold

00:15.070 --> 00:16.068
was a member of Rittenhouse?

00:16.071 --> 00:17.737
He was a founding member.

00:17.739 --> 00:19.940
We're gonna stop them
before they ever get started.

00:19.942 --> 00:22.955
You help me, and I'll give you
the name of your wife's killer.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.386
The man you're asking
about... David Rittenhouse.

00:25.411 --> 00:26.470
Introduce us to him.

00:26.495 --> 00:28.048
Killing me won't change anything.

00:29.618 --> 00:31.418
His son, he escaped.

00:31.420 --> 00:32.619
- Move!
- No!

00:32.621 --> 00:35.889
- I'm not letting you kill a child.
- He's all that's left of Rittenhouse.

00:39.065 --> 00:40.627
- John!
- I thought you understood

00:40.629 --> 00:41.840
what was at stake.

00:41.888 --> 00:43.350
- Lucy!
- Wyatt!

00:43.375 --> 00:44.707
Lucy!

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

00:57.145 --> 00:59.012
- Where's Flynn?
- Why, what's going on?

00:59.014 --> 01:01.473
- He got Lucy.
- What are you talking about?

01:01.498 --> 01:03.431
What do you mean, he got Lucy?

01:05.194 --> 01:08.186
- Where's the Mothership?
- Um...

01:08.363 --> 01:09.729
it's all over the place.

01:09.731 --> 01:10.936
What the hell does that mean, Jiya?

01:10.961 --> 01:13.099
Flynn jumped to Sacramento, present day.

01:13.101 --> 01:14.767
He was there for maybe an hour,

01:14.769 --> 01:17.503
and then he jumped
again to New York, 1780.

01:17.505 --> 01:18.705
I don't get it.

01:18.707 --> 01:21.040
Well, how does Flynn jump so
fast and so many times in a row?

01:21.042 --> 01:22.775
The nuke... the one he got in Vegas,

01:22.777 --> 01:24.911
if he's using it as a battery,
the way we think he is.

01:24.913 --> 01:26.012
And what the hell is he doing?

01:26.037 --> 01:28.949
- What happened to Lucy?
- We lost track of her.

01:28.951 --> 01:30.617
I lost track of her. Flynn got her.

01:49.037 --> 01:50.890
What happened?

01:52.710 --> 01:54.710
- Get... get off me!
- I'll tell you what happened.

01:54.735 --> 01:56.776
I went back to that damn compound

01:56.778 --> 01:58.578
to fix the mess you made...

01:58.580 --> 02:00.826
to kill Rittenhouse and his son.

02:00.851 --> 02:02.615
I never got even close.

02:02.617 --> 02:05.218
I didn't have Benedict Arnold
to get me through the door.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.621
Even my semiautomatics were
nothing against 50 muskets.

02:09.591 --> 02:12.325
So my family is still dead.

02:12.327 --> 02:14.460
And Rittenhouse survived.

02:15.964 --> 02:17.681
And it's your fault.

02:17.706 --> 02:19.632
I told you, they had other followers.

02:19.634 --> 02:22.302
We don't know if killing that
boy would've changed anything.

02:22.304 --> 02:25.146
It could have changed everything.

02:26.007 --> 02:27.807
Okay!

02:27.809 --> 02:31.344
So we'll just find that brat
when he's a few years older.

02:31.346 --> 02:33.313
So where is he? Where
is John Rittenhouse?

02:33.315 --> 02:35.682
- I don't know.
- Well, then find him.

02:35.684 --> 02:38.510
There's no record of him anywhere.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.820
You shot his father!
You tried to kill him.

02:40.822 --> 02:41.988
I'm sure he went deep underground.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.289
He changed his name!

02:43.291 --> 02:45.491
So this was our only shot.

02:49.639 --> 02:52.865
All this would have been over.

02:54.535 --> 02:57.203
Just get up.

02:57.228 --> 02:59.672
No. Wait, wait. Where are you...

02:59.674 --> 03:01.007
where are you taking me?

03:01.009 --> 03:02.836
I wanted to do this the easy way.

03:02.914 --> 03:04.477
But you left me no choice.

03:04.479 --> 03:06.212
So now I'm going to
take down Rittenhouse

03:06.214 --> 03:08.581
one member at a time.

03:09.951 --> 03:12.051
So for as long as it takes.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.992
Flynn just jumped again?

03:19.994 --> 03:21.961
Uh, yeah, to Illinois this time.

03:21.963 --> 03:23.796
May 30, 1893.

03:23.798 --> 03:25.865
It's the month the Chicago
World's Fair opened.

03:25.867 --> 03:27.467
- Why would he go there?
- I don't know.

03:27.469 --> 03:28.701
We're kind of short a historian.

03:28.703 --> 03:30.203
Not for long. Let's go, Rufus.

03:30.205 --> 03:31.671
The Lifeboat's still charging.

03:31.673 --> 03:32.905
You got to be kidding me.

03:32.907 --> 03:34.874
How long till it's charged?

03:36.911 --> 03:38.344
Four hours.

03:53.361 --> 03:55.603
Chicago World's Fair.

03:56.531 --> 03:59.432
That's the very first
Ferris wheel, right?

03:59.674 --> 04:01.434
We're not here to burn it down,

04:01.436 --> 04:03.169
if that's what you're worried about.

04:03.171 --> 04:05.705
I'm sure you intend to do
something equally horrible.

04:05.707 --> 04:08.174
At about 4:00 p.m. tomorrow,

04:08.176 --> 04:10.510
there's gonna be a
very important meeting

04:10.512 --> 04:12.378
between Thomas Edison, Henry Ford,

04:12.380 --> 04:14.276
and J.P. Morgan.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.111
I'm gonna kill them all.

04:17.136 --> 04:19.503
And you're gonna help me.

04:19.528 --> 04:21.127
They're all part of Rittenhouse.

04:21.389 --> 04:23.104
Hey!

04:23.958 --> 04:25.792
Honey...

04:25.794 --> 04:28.895
I would think long and hard
before you turn me down.

04:28.897 --> 04:30.596
What happened to all that
talk about needing me?

04:30.598 --> 04:31.898
About us fighting side by side?

04:31.900 --> 04:34.967
You wrote in here that one day,

04:34.969 --> 04:36.469
we would stop Rittenhouse...

04:36.471 --> 04:38.070
together.

04:38.072 --> 04:40.540
And that day came, and
you wouldn't help me.

04:40.542 --> 04:42.508
You let Rittenhouse live.

04:44.131 --> 04:47.199
I really thought we were
gonna do great things.

04:50.218 --> 04:51.818
But maybe I was wrong
about this journal.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.719
Maybe... maybe I was wrong about you.

04:53.721 --> 04:56.289
Maybe you're wrong
about a lot of things.

04:56.314 --> 04:58.234
Well, then maybe we're not meant

04:58.259 --> 05:00.817
to be a team after
all, and you know what?

05:00.842 --> 05:03.796
If that's true, that
makes you expendable.

05:04.692 --> 05:07.459
So what's it gonna be, Lucy?

05:07.462 --> 05:09.278
Are you gonna help me or not?

05:15.355 --> 05:18.455
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

05:26.098 --> 05:28.168
There's nothing on this recorder.

05:28.192 --> 05:29.792
That's 'cause I erased the recording.

05:29.793 --> 05:31.026
And why would you do that?

05:31.028 --> 05:33.261
Because if Rittenhouse heard it,

05:34.031 --> 05:35.830
they'd know we killed their founder.

05:35.832 --> 05:37.098
You did what?

05:37.100 --> 05:39.434
Well, technically Flynn
did, but we helped a little.

05:39.436 --> 05:41.002
Rufus, do you have any idea

05:41.004 --> 05:42.704
how much trouble you're in?

05:42.706 --> 05:44.439
This was your last chance.

05:46.777 --> 05:49.310
Um... you should run.

05:49.312 --> 05:52.026
- Run? Run where?
- I'll help you.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.349
Um, you... you need a new identity

05:54.351 --> 05:55.950
and a new passport.

05:55.952 --> 05:58.019
Your family will come with you too,

05:58.021 --> 06:00.648
of course, and then I need to set
up an offshore account for you,

06:00.673 --> 06:01.800
and that way you can...

06:01.825 --> 06:03.191
Are you listening to me?

06:03.193 --> 06:05.026
I'm not going to run.

06:05.028 --> 06:07.195
I don't think you're
appropriately frightened here.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.230
Of course I am scared.

06:09.232 --> 06:11.266
Be crazy not to be.

06:12.636 --> 06:17.138
But I'm not going
anywhere till we find Lucy.

06:19.176 --> 06:21.333
By then, it may be too late.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.513
No, no, please.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.615
R-Rufus, you have to...

06:30.020 --> 06:31.152
What do we know about this fair?

06:31.154 --> 06:32.387
Lot of stuff was invented there...

06:32.389 --> 06:33.855
Cream of Wheat, Hershey's chocolate,

06:33.857 --> 06:35.690
Aunt Jemima... how is that
still a thing, by the way?

06:35.692 --> 06:37.325
- Rufus.
- Uh, Teddy Roosevelt was there.

06:37.327 --> 06:38.927
Thomas Edison, Susan B. Anthony,

06:38.929 --> 06:40.662
Helen Keller... not that I think

06:40.664 --> 06:42.263
Flynn's gonna take out Helen Keller.

06:42.265 --> 06:44.383
Sorry, I... I ramble
a lot when I'm stressed.

06:44.408 --> 06:46.611
Okay, we start with Roosevelt.
If we find Flynn, we find Lucy.

06:46.636 --> 06:48.539
- We sure he's going after Roosevelt?
- No.

06:48.564 --> 06:51.489
But he's gonna be president in eight
years, so that's the best I got.

06:51.514 --> 06:54.749
Wyatt, we're gonna get her back.

07:33.444 --> 07:35.768
That's Roosevelt.

07:36.304 --> 07:38.003
Roosevelt's skinny.

07:38.028 --> 07:39.828
Flynn's got to be here somewhere.

07:44.889 --> 07:47.190
Rufus, that's Flynn's guy.

07:47.193 --> 07:48.859
Come on.

08:24.029 --> 08:26.430
Here we are. It's called Pabst.

08:26.432 --> 08:28.766
Just won blue ribbon at the fair.

08:28.768 --> 08:31.068
Thank you.

08:31.070 --> 08:33.270
So, Professor, as you well know,

08:33.272 --> 08:36.039
Edison was a paranoid son of a bitch.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.275
Didn't trust anyone
near his prototypes...

08:38.277 --> 08:40.477
except Henry Ford, who was...?

08:40.479 --> 08:42.946
Edison's employee. His
chief engineer at the time.

08:42.948 --> 08:45.215
This afternoon, Edison and Ford

08:45.217 --> 08:48.118
are going to meet with
their financier, J.P. Morgan.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.154
They'll be in a heavily guarded room...

08:50.156 --> 08:53.557
very difficult to get into,
even for me, even in 1893.

08:53.559 --> 08:55.659
But still, before they show up,

08:55.661 --> 08:57.494
I'm gonna plant a bomb there.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.263
I'm not going to help you.
You'll have to kill me.

08:59.265 --> 09:00.764
You don't think I will?

09:01.224 --> 09:02.933
I read your classified file.

09:02.935 --> 09:04.401
Don't believe everything you read.

09:04.403 --> 09:05.836
You saved people in Kosovo.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.771
You helped a family in Iraq.

09:07.773 --> 09:09.006
You used to care about people.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.008
You used to be good.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.744
That Rittenhouse killed
your family, I believe you.

09:13.746 --> 09:15.679
But now you're putting
all of us in danger.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.149
Well, they were easy to find.

09:19.151 --> 09:22.284
They went right for Roosevelt,
just like you said they would.

09:22.309 --> 09:24.655
- What is he talking about?
- Maybe you don't care about yourself,

09:24.657 --> 09:28.059
but you do care about
Wyatt and Rufus, don't you?

09:28.223 --> 09:31.810
I've sent your friends to
the, ah, World's Fair Hotel.

09:31.835 --> 09:33.402
You son of a bitch.

09:33.427 --> 09:36.300
But the hotel came to
be known by another name.

09:36.302 --> 09:38.802
- What was that again?
- The Murder Castle.

09:38.804 --> 09:41.438
You know, the phrase "serial killer"

09:41.440 --> 09:43.753
was not even coined
yet when H.H. Holmes,

09:43.778 --> 09:45.475
the owner of the Murder
Castle, was caught?

09:45.477 --> 09:47.711
- Is that right?
- The press called him a, uh,

09:47.713 --> 09:49.313
"multi-murderer."

09:49.315 --> 09:53.217
And the hotel he built was
an elaborate death trap.

09:53.727 --> 09:57.187
Trapdoors, acid vats, torture racks...

09:57.189 --> 09:59.289
he'd even dissect them sometimes.

09:59.291 --> 10:01.525
But you know all this, Lucy, don't you?

10:08.734 --> 10:10.367
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

10:10.369 --> 10:12.069
Excuse me.

10:12.071 --> 10:13.709
Uh, do you work here?

10:13.711 --> 10:15.990
- Uh, can I help you?
- Yeah, thin man in a gray suit...

10:16.015 --> 10:17.040
have you seen him come by?

10:17.042 --> 10:19.009
No, I haven't seen any thin man.

10:19.011 --> 10:21.144
But, uh, you have a good day, now.

10:24.327 --> 10:25.893
Think Lucy's here somewhere?

10:25.918 --> 10:28.085
I'm not leaving till
we find out for sure.

10:28.436 --> 10:29.720
Let's split up.

10:35.661 --> 10:37.694
You can still save your friends, Lucy.

10:37.696 --> 10:40.397
The sooner you help me, the
sooner you can get back to them,

10:40.399 --> 10:41.832
hopefully in time.

10:41.834 --> 10:44.001
Maybe you can help me
find someone who can

10:44.003 --> 10:46.236
evade the security,
break into the offices...

10:46.238 --> 10:48.627
all that without being detected.

10:48.652 --> 10:51.720
Oh, come on, Lucy, you
always have all the answers.

10:52.711 --> 10:54.211
Ladies and gentlemen!

10:54.213 --> 10:56.747
I am the great Harry Houdini!

10:56.749 --> 10:58.115
Welcome.

11:02.388 --> 11:04.588
He may not be famous yet, but
there's still no one better

11:04.590 --> 11:07.190
at getting into or out of tight spots.

11:07.192 --> 11:10.488
For this act, I will need a volunteer.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.963
Good.

11:27.313 --> 11:28.445
I'm so sorry.

11:28.447 --> 11:29.746
No, it's my fault.

11:29.748 --> 11:32.229
I wasn't watching where I was going.

11:33.118 --> 11:34.551
Did you draw these?

11:34.553 --> 11:36.453
You sound surprised.

11:36.455 --> 11:38.956
No, not surprised. Impressed.

11:41.393 --> 11:43.060
- You good?
- Yeah.

11:43.062 --> 11:44.328
Oh.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.674
- Key.
- Oh.

11:45.699 --> 11:46.730
Um, would you mind?

11:46.732 --> 11:48.932
- My room's right there.
- No.

11:48.934 --> 11:50.734
Thank you.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.905
Would you mind helping me with my books?

11:54.907 --> 11:56.876
Okay, I got it.

11:56.901 --> 11:59.142
Ah.

11:59.144 --> 12:00.844
Thank you for your help.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.412
You know what? Actually...

12:02.414 --> 12:03.747
you might be able to help me.

12:03.749 --> 12:05.115
Uh, I'm looking for a friend.

12:05.117 --> 12:06.945
She's gone missing.

12:06.970 --> 12:08.595
That's awful.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.420
When did she go missing?

12:10.422 --> 12:13.190
Last night. Uh, dark hair, brown eyes...

12:13.192 --> 12:14.982
she could be with a tall man.

12:15.115 --> 12:17.928
- A funny accent.
- No, I'm sorry. I haven't seen her.

12:17.930 --> 12:19.963
You sure? She could be in trouble.

12:19.965 --> 12:21.865
What kind of trouble?

12:25.104 --> 12:26.336
Hello?

12:29.174 --> 12:31.441
Brother needs some Febreze up in here.

12:48.631 --> 12:50.197
What the hell?

13:03.943 --> 13:06.009
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

13:06.011 --> 13:07.244
Wyatt!

13:08.747 --> 13:11.644
- I should go.
- I hope you find your friend.

13:11.669 --> 13:13.535
Thanks.

13:16.889 --> 13:18.388
It's locked.

13:22.995 --> 13:24.928
What is that? What's happening?

13:30.669 --> 13:31.835
Breathe into this.

13:51.489 --> 13:53.490
You say your name is Lucy?

13:53.491 --> 13:55.090
Lucy, that's right.

13:55.092 --> 13:57.459
Now, Lucy, have we ever met before?

13:57.461 --> 13:58.661
No.

13:58.663 --> 13:59.929
We have never met before.

13:59.931 --> 14:01.430
How sad for me.

14:01.432 --> 14:02.998
Lucy, will you please check my handcuffs

14:03.000 --> 14:05.549
and make sure they're tried
securely behind my back?

14:06.270 --> 14:07.736
Yup, they're... they're locked.

14:07.738 --> 14:09.538
Ladies and gentlemen,
as this beautiful lady

14:09.540 --> 14:12.646
has just confirmed, my hands
are tied securely behind my back.

14:12.671 --> 14:14.577
I will now step into this trunk.

14:14.579 --> 14:17.143
My brother Dash will then lock it shut.

14:17.168 --> 14:20.269
Trapped inside, it will be hard to move.

14:21.108 --> 14:24.440
Even harder to breathe.

14:34.814 --> 14:39.750
Ma'am, if you will, please see
that these are indeed locked.

14:43.422 --> 14:44.888
Okay, they're locked.

14:47.526 --> 14:48.992
And the curtain, please.

14:57.386 --> 14:59.937
No!

15:04.863 --> 15:06.361
Thank you, thank you.

15:06.386 --> 15:09.246
And please, tell your friends
about the great Houdini.

15:11.750 --> 15:12.916
Oh, thank you.

15:12.918 --> 15:14.651
That was amazing.

15:14.653 --> 15:16.186
It was so good.

15:27.641 --> 15:30.000
Hi. Hello.

15:30.727 --> 15:33.429
- Thanks for your help.
- Oh, you were amazing.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.588
I have to tell you, I...
I'm one of your biggest fans.

15:36.590 --> 15:38.290
I wasn't aware I had any fans.

15:38.315 --> 15:41.185
You know, my uncle, uh, owns
a theater here in Chicago,

15:41.187 --> 15:42.256
and he's looking for a new act.

15:42.281 --> 15:43.477
He saw your show, and he loved it.

15:43.502 --> 15:45.569
If you were interested, I
could make an introduction.

15:45.571 --> 15:46.870
- Yes.
- Really?

15:46.872 --> 15:48.834
- Yes, of course. I'm very interested.
- He's right outside.

15:48.859 --> 15:50.249
Would you like to meet him now?

15:50.274 --> 15:51.842
- Yes, of course.
- Right this way.

15:51.844 --> 15:52.849
Thank you.

15:52.874 --> 15:54.794
I am really, really, sorry.

15:56.015 --> 15:58.515
Mr. Houdini. A pleasure.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.622
I don't know what she's told you,

16:05.624 --> 16:07.024
but I don't have any money.

16:07.026 --> 16:08.592
Oh, we don't need your money.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.227
We need you to pick a lock.

16:19.071 --> 16:20.337
I think he's coming to.

16:21.740 --> 16:22.973
It's all right! It's all right!

16:22.975 --> 16:24.775
I'm not trying to hurt you!

16:24.777 --> 16:27.010
- Who are you?
- I'm George.

16:27.012 --> 16:28.445
My name is George Henry.

16:28.447 --> 16:31.648
We've all been waiting
for you to wake up.

16:31.650 --> 16:34.151
Hey, buddy.

16:34.153 --> 16:36.687
I got gassed, too. Good times.

16:36.689 --> 16:37.954
Glad you're not dead.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.633
- That makes two of us.
- Yep.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.100
Where the hell are we?

16:47.125 --> 16:48.925
We're still in the hotel, I think.

16:48.950 --> 16:51.468
Last thing I remember is going
to bed, and when I woke up,

16:51.470 --> 16:52.803
I was in here.

16:55.981 --> 16:59.308
No, no, you can't open that
door from in here, trust me.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.245
I've tried.

17:02.818 --> 17:05.083
How long have you been here?

17:05.108 --> 17:07.075
I don't know. Couple hours.

17:07.077 --> 17:09.810
It's hard to tell time in here.

17:09.813 --> 17:12.547
Help! Help!

17:12.548 --> 17:14.181
Somebody help us!

17:14.183 --> 17:16.885
We're trapped in here!

17:27.917 --> 17:29.651
Can anyone hear me?

17:29.653 --> 17:30.985
Help!

17:30.987 --> 17:33.254
You have to stop yelling.

17:33.256 --> 17:35.857
This chamber is
soundproofed and airtight.

17:35.859 --> 17:38.026
We can't use up all the oxygen.

17:39.135 --> 17:40.762
How do you know it's airtight?

17:40.764 --> 17:42.455
Because I'm an architect,

17:42.480 --> 17:45.415
and I've been staring at the
room for the last 20 minutes.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.971
So any ideas on food?

17:49.973 --> 17:51.172
Water?

17:51.174 --> 17:53.475
There's no water.

17:53.477 --> 17:57.412
Although I do have this.

17:57.414 --> 17:59.481
Happy to share.

17:59.483 --> 18:01.418
Cracker Jacks.

18:02.352 --> 18:04.886
Used to love these as a kid.

18:04.888 --> 18:07.389
A kid? Those debuted
at the fair yesterday.

18:07.391 --> 18:08.823
Yeah, well...

18:11.161 --> 18:12.694
some Cracker Jacks.

18:12.696 --> 18:14.429
What I don't understand
is why someone would build

18:14.431 --> 18:16.967
an airtight chamber in a hotel.

18:18.301 --> 18:21.936
The same reasons they put
gas jets in the guest rooms.

18:21.961 --> 18:24.971
Someone built this place to trap people.

18:25.642 --> 18:28.343
- Who would do that?
- A serial killer.

18:28.345 --> 18:29.711
What is...

18:29.713 --> 18:31.736
a serial killer?

18:31.761 --> 18:33.528
A psychopath.

18:33.919 --> 18:37.085
Someone who wants to
torture people for...

18:37.677 --> 18:39.087
fun.

18:39.768 --> 18:41.568
Who would do such a thing?

18:41.593 --> 18:44.026
Well, they're a little more
common where we come from.

18:49.931 --> 18:51.564
He lured us here.

18:51.566 --> 18:55.134
Flynn knew about this place,
and he led us straight here.

18:55.136 --> 18:57.703
God knows what he's doing with Lucy.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.605
She could be here too, for all we know.

19:01.910 --> 19:05.445
So what, we got about four,
five hours left of oxygen?

19:05.447 --> 19:06.946
Maybe less.

19:10.151 --> 19:12.752
I'm sorry to get you
involved in all of this.

19:12.754 --> 19:14.740
These men, they're holding
my friends hostage, and I...

19:14.765 --> 19:15.931
I didn't have a choice.

19:15.956 --> 19:17.260
I suppose it's my fault

19:17.285 --> 19:18.940
for wanting to believe
you were really a fan.

19:18.965 --> 19:20.592
No, I am a fan.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.532
I think what you do is amazing.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.704
I got trapped underwater once,

19:24.729 --> 19:26.865
and it was the most
terrifying moment of my life.

19:26.867 --> 19:30.001
And you, you lock yourself up
to entertain people for a living.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.937
- How?
- You wanna know the real trick?

19:33.507 --> 19:35.974
- Fear isn't real.
- What do you mean?

19:36.313 --> 19:38.246
Fear isn't what's actually happening.

19:38.248 --> 19:40.348
It's just your reaction to it.

19:40.350 --> 19:43.385
So I clear my head...

19:43.387 --> 19:45.061
think one single thought.

19:45.086 --> 19:46.452
What's the thought?

19:46.890 --> 19:48.723
Escape.

19:49.936 --> 19:51.735
You also have this other trick...

19:51.737 --> 19:54.138
The Cutpurse, I believe it's called.

19:54.530 --> 19:56.663
Maybe you could teach it to me sometime.

19:58.293 --> 19:59.810
That's right.

19:59.812 --> 20:02.066
I always did love that trick.

20:03.649 --> 20:05.950
- I'll do just that.
- Stop.

20:05.952 --> 20:08.057
We're here.

20:08.721 --> 20:09.954
You're up.

20:26.033 --> 20:28.540
My friend's gonna stay
out here with the girl.

20:28.565 --> 20:30.212
You try anything...

20:30.237 --> 20:31.670
he kills her.

20:58.103 --> 20:59.423
You weren't kidding.

20:59.798 --> 21:01.531
Edison really is paranoid.

21:01.556 --> 21:03.623
- Can you open it?
- It'll take some time.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.625
- Ten minutes maybe.
- You got three.

21:05.627 --> 21:07.794
Those Pinkertons will be back soon.

21:15.334 --> 21:17.017
I have another idea.

21:54.822 --> 21:57.189
That tiny thing is a bomb?

21:59.393 --> 22:01.960
What did Edison ever do to you?

22:04.565 --> 22:07.165
Well, I guess the meeting
wasn't at 4:00 after all.

22:07.167 --> 22:10.468
- Who are you?
- Mr. Edison, Mr. Ford.

22:10.470 --> 22:11.937
Mr. Morgan.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.238
Rare pleasure to meet you.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.940
My name is Garcia Flynn.

22:14.942 --> 22:18.004
And you are Rittenhouse.

22:20.771 --> 22:22.071
Looking for this?

22:24.903 --> 22:26.818
It's a sleight of hand.

22:27.086 --> 22:28.719
It's called The Cutpurse.

22:28.721 --> 22:30.421
What the hell is going on, young man?

22:30.423 --> 22:31.722
Guards!

22:32.140 --> 22:34.058
Gentlemen, if I were you,

22:34.060 --> 22:37.507
I'd vacate this fair city
as quickly as possible.

22:39.732 --> 22:42.411
Oh, by the way...

22:42.436 --> 22:44.502
you've just been saved...

22:44.504 --> 22:46.811
by the great Harry Houdini.

22:48.678 --> 22:50.141
See my show if you can.

23:05.169 --> 23:07.069
Mentioning The Cutpurse to me...

23:07.071 --> 23:08.403
that was pretty smart.

23:08.405 --> 23:10.105
I was hoping you'd get what I meant.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.934
That's why I came to
you... so you would help me.

23:13.247 --> 23:14.708
How'd you know I could?

23:14.710 --> 23:16.395
You're the best in the world
at getting out of tight spots,

23:16.420 --> 23:18.046
and I was in a really tight spot.

23:18.048 --> 23:19.414
Did you get the bomb?

23:19.416 --> 23:21.262
Yes, got it.

23:21.852 --> 23:23.618
Hell of a thing.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.489
I've never seen guns like these before.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.290
I'll take that.

23:29.292 --> 23:32.761
Well, Lucy, I wish I
could say this was fun,

23:32.763 --> 23:34.596
but I'd be lying.

23:34.598 --> 23:36.498
Wait.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.099
I still need your help.

23:38.101 --> 23:40.035
My friends, they're...
they're trapped in a hotel

23:40.037 --> 23:41.269
with a serial killer.

23:41.271 --> 23:42.504
What's a serial killer?

23:42.506 --> 23:43.872
I'll explain on the way. Come on.

23:43.874 --> 23:44.943
We have to go. They're in danger.

23:44.968 --> 23:47.853
We should go to the police.

23:47.878 --> 23:50.011
- They'll think I'm crazy.
- And I won't?

23:50.036 --> 23:52.904
What do you do for a living?
Crazy's part of the job, right?

23:54.117 --> 23:55.483
Please?

24:26.426 --> 24:28.757
We're running out of air.

24:28.792 --> 24:30.993
My heart won't stop pounding.

24:31.167 --> 24:32.733
I'm really scared.

24:34.776 --> 24:37.417
- Are you scared?
- Yeah.

24:37.701 --> 24:39.956
It's becoming a daily thing with me.

24:40.433 --> 24:42.504
My little boy... he's eight.

24:42.506 --> 24:44.606
He has this jack-in-the-box.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.608
And every time he cranks it,

24:47.350 --> 24:49.911
it pops out, and he laughs
like it's the very first time.

24:49.913 --> 24:53.223
He's got this laugh that just...

24:54.813 --> 24:57.661
it makes you want to start laughing too.

25:05.429 --> 25:07.608
I just want to hear it again.

25:07.976 --> 25:10.288
I can't stop thinking about my father.

25:12.158 --> 25:16.054
How he's waiting for me to come home
and tell him all about my big trip.

25:16.496 --> 25:18.694
He was so proud.

25:18.719 --> 25:22.233
You know, I designed the
Woman's Pavilion at the fair.

25:22.235 --> 25:23.835
Really?

25:23.837 --> 25:26.804
I went to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology

25:26.806 --> 25:28.973
for architecture...

25:28.975 --> 25:30.408
first woman to do it.

25:30.410 --> 25:32.009
You went to MIT?

25:34.835 --> 25:36.135
So did I.

25:38.688 --> 25:41.719
Oh, you must be Robert Robinson Taylor.

25:41.721 --> 25:43.788
No, uh...

25:43.790 --> 25:45.156
I'm the other black guy.

25:45.158 --> 25:46.424
There were two?

25:47.660 --> 25:49.961
Ugh!

25:50.728 --> 25:52.928
This isn't working.

25:57.392 --> 26:00.337
We are going to die here.

26:00.362 --> 26:02.862
My father will never know what happened.

26:03.092 --> 26:05.118
It'll just be like...

26:05.760 --> 26:07.806
I dropped off the face of the Earth.

26:13.169 --> 26:15.293
I know what that's like...

26:16.278 --> 26:18.439
to have someone missing.

26:22.378 --> 26:26.113
Not knowing, always wondering.

26:26.115 --> 26:28.482
That's the worst part.

26:28.484 --> 26:30.784
But I'm not gonna let that happen.

26:31.145 --> 26:32.411
You understand me?

26:32.436 --> 26:33.869
You're gonna go home to your father...

26:33.894 --> 26:35.527
you, your son.

26:36.641 --> 26:38.241
But I need you to help me.

26:51.423 --> 26:53.156
Police are downstairs.

26:59.064 --> 27:00.396
Ugh!

27:13.822 --> 27:15.589
I'm telling you, these
joints... they're impossible.

27:15.614 --> 27:17.513
It's never g...

27:23.785 --> 27:25.018
What?

27:25.370 --> 27:27.426
Do you see this one brick?

27:30.043 --> 27:31.542
It's concrete.

27:31.544 --> 27:32.777
And it's spalling.

27:32.779 --> 27:34.011
What does that mean?

27:34.013 --> 27:35.780
The material is deteriorating.

27:35.782 --> 27:38.883
Yeah, if we can find
something to make a small hole,

27:38.885 --> 27:40.685
we might be able to
get someone to hear us.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.930
Will this work?

27:44.072 --> 27:45.505
It's worth a try.

27:53.099 --> 27:55.233
- Where do we start?
- I don't know.

27:55.235 --> 27:56.868
H.H. Holmes is a monster.

27:56.870 --> 27:59.737
There are isolation chambers and
secret chutes hidden all over.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.607
My friends could be anywhere.

28:02.609 --> 28:04.720
So could Holmes.

28:05.931 --> 28:07.230
Come on.

28:28.135 --> 28:29.402
You did it, Wyatt.

28:29.404 --> 28:31.348
Hello?

28:31.697 --> 28:33.339
Can anyone hear me?

28:33.341 --> 28:35.275
Is anyone out there?

28:38.814 --> 28:41.314
Can anyone hear me?

28:41.316 --> 28:42.749
Did you hear that?

28:42.751 --> 28:44.517
- I heard something.
- Hello?

28:45.005 --> 28:46.352
- Wyatt?
- Can anyone hear me?

28:46.354 --> 28:47.720
Wyatt!

28:50.443 --> 28:51.943
- Hello?
- I think...

28:51.945 --> 28:53.544
it sounds like it's coming from... here?

28:53.546 --> 28:54.943
A bookcase?

28:54.968 --> 28:57.248
I mean, that would be
too obvious, wouldn't it?

28:59.509 --> 29:01.288
Guess not.

29:02.655 --> 29:05.223
This Holmes doesn't
have much imagination.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.577
I, uh...

29:09.929 --> 29:12.014
I don't like tight spaces.

29:18.772 --> 29:20.605
Can anyone hear me?

29:20.607 --> 29:23.317
Is anyone out there? Hello?

29:23.342 --> 29:25.342
Can anyone hear me?

29:29.182 --> 29:31.916
Wyatt? Is that you?

29:31.918 --> 29:33.618
Is that Lucy?

29:33.620 --> 29:36.231
- Lucy?
- Is... is Rufus with you?

29:36.256 --> 29:38.356
Hey! I am!

29:38.686 --> 29:40.486
Man, is it good to hear your voice.

29:40.488 --> 29:42.154
You too.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.690
- Are you okay?
- Can you get us out of here?

29:44.692 --> 29:47.960
Now this I can do.

29:47.962 --> 29:49.428
You with someone?

29:49.430 --> 29:51.897
Yes, I... I brought
Harry Houdini with me.

29:51.899 --> 29:54.833
Did Lucy just say she
brought Harry Houdini?

29:54.835 --> 29:56.835
Who's Harry Houdini?

30:00.441 --> 30:01.974
Thank God you're all right.

30:01.976 --> 30:04.910
I'm okay.

30:05.788 --> 30:07.866
- Where's Flynn?
- He's locked in an office somewhere,

30:07.891 --> 30:09.691
thanks to Harry here.

30:09.694 --> 30:11.260
Brought you a present.

30:12.697 --> 30:15.113
Hi. Hi!

30:15.138 --> 30:17.366
- You're okay.
- Yes, so are you.

30:17.368 --> 30:19.569
Uh, this is Sophia and George.

30:19.594 --> 30:21.904
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

30:21.906 --> 30:24.057
Thank you. We should probably get going

30:24.082 --> 30:25.675
before someone realizes we're gone.

30:25.677 --> 30:27.443
He's right. We should get out of here.

30:27.445 --> 30:28.945
Follow me.

30:30.922 --> 30:32.727
Lucy.

30:33.516 --> 30:35.151
We're not done here yet.

30:38.299 --> 30:40.744
I told you, I'm not H.H. Holmes.

30:40.783 --> 30:43.618
- My name is Pat Quinlan.
- Yeah? Prove it.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.453
Okay, um, in my pocket.

30:50.171 --> 30:51.604
He's telling the truth.

30:51.606 --> 30:53.288
Quinlan is the hotel's caretaker.

30:53.320 --> 30:54.853
- Where's your boss?
- I don't know.

30:56.123 --> 30:57.822
Try harder.

30:57.824 --> 31:00.759
He's... probably in his
office on the third floor.

31:00.761 --> 31:02.627
Show me.

31:04.998 --> 31:06.231
Get the police.

31:06.233 --> 31:08.419
Go! Right now!

31:25.747 --> 31:27.388
Wyatt?

31:28.309 --> 31:29.708
Wyatt?

31:30.316 --> 31:31.561
George is H.H. H...

31:36.349 --> 31:37.462
Wyatt! Rufus!

31:39.525 --> 31:41.191
Lucy!

31:42.979 --> 31:45.877
What? What happened? Where's Lucy?

31:58.744 --> 31:59.977
Oh, God.

32:02.815 --> 32:04.407
Where am I?

32:09.888 --> 32:11.321
What's happening?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.944
Where am I?

32:14.553 --> 32:16.560
Oh, my God.

32:16.562 --> 32:18.350
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:19.499 --> 32:20.864
What's happening?

32:26.294 --> 32:27.804
How did this happen?

32:27.806 --> 32:31.622
The thin man... I did
everything he said.

32:31.693 --> 32:33.243
Let me out.

32:33.529 --> 32:35.043
Let me out of here!

32:35.068 --> 32:37.134
He paid me to trap your friends.

32:37.136 --> 32:39.136
Did he set me up?

32:39.138 --> 32:40.671
What am I gonna do?

32:42.108 --> 32:44.338
They'll find out.

32:44.768 --> 32:46.901
They'll find out everything.

32:48.848 --> 32:50.627
Please.

32:51.618 --> 32:52.950
please...

32:52.952 --> 32:54.757
just get me out of here.

32:54.782 --> 32:56.554
Get me out.

32:58.424 --> 32:59.790
Get me out of here!

32:59.792 --> 33:01.392
Get me out!

33:03.329 --> 33:05.218
Please!

33:05.359 --> 33:07.292
Be quiet.

33:14.780 --> 33:16.513
Escape.

33:20.386 --> 33:22.353
Escape.

33:24.123 --> 33:26.423
Fear isn't real.

33:28.094 --> 33:29.493
Escape.

33:32.098 --> 33:34.265
Escape.

33:35.534 --> 33:38.135
If I'm going to burn in hell,

33:38.378 --> 33:40.144
you're going to burn with me.

33:40.169 --> 33:42.802
I wouldn't do that if I
were you, Herman Mudgett.

33:46.257 --> 33:48.679
I'm not like the other women.

33:48.890 --> 33:51.949
And there have been so
many women, haven't there?

33:52.429 --> 33:55.653
- How do you know my real name?
- I know a lot of things about you.

33:56.078 --> 33:59.379
You're a doctor and a con man.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.331
Who are you?

34:04.486 --> 34:06.519
I'm a psychic.

34:06.521 --> 34:08.254
And I know that you're a spiritualist,

34:08.255 --> 34:11.891
so you believe, don't you?

34:11.893 --> 34:16.329
Well, I have seen your past,

34:16.331 --> 34:18.639
and I know your future.

34:21.203 --> 34:22.534
You said he'd be in his office.

34:22.536 --> 34:24.344
I said he'd probably be in his office.

34:24.369 --> 34:26.869
- Well, where is he actually, then?
- I can't be sure.

34:26.871 --> 34:28.304
Do not tell me that you don't know

34:28.306 --> 34:30.083
what's been going on at this hotel.

34:30.442 --> 34:31.699
I don't want to know.

34:31.725 --> 34:33.425
Okay...

34:33.449 --> 34:34.777
Where would he take her?

34:34.779 --> 34:36.679
Sometimes he...

34:36.681 --> 34:38.414
disappears into the basement.

34:38.416 --> 34:40.449
No, no. You're no psychic.

34:40.452 --> 34:42.351
If I'm not who I say I
am, then how would I know

34:42.353 --> 34:45.554
that your father beat
you when you were a child?

34:45.556 --> 34:47.223
And your mother...

34:47.225 --> 34:49.559
your mother was too weak
to stop him, wasn't she?

34:49.561 --> 34:51.561
- You're just trying to trick me.
- No, I'm not.

34:51.563 --> 34:54.197
I know that you have a
baby with your first wife

34:54.199 --> 34:56.625
and that you abandoned your family...

34:56.710 --> 34:59.735
to start a new one with a new woman.

35:00.126 --> 35:04.295
There have been so many women
that you have loved and killed.

35:04.297 --> 35:05.930
Why are you telling me this?

35:07.601 --> 35:09.667
I can help you.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.569
If you let me out of here,

35:11.571 --> 35:14.305
I promise I will...

35:14.307 --> 35:17.164
help you achieve great wealth

35:17.219 --> 35:19.726
and live a long and happy life.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.551
Isn't that what you want, Herman?

35:21.575 --> 35:23.909
Money, power...

35:23.911 --> 35:26.011
I can help you get them all.

35:27.348 --> 35:29.181
Don't move!

35:29.183 --> 35:30.549
Wyatt, I'm in here!

35:32.453 --> 35:34.253
Rufus, get her out.

35:34.255 --> 35:36.287
Get me out of here!

35:38.626 --> 35:39.901
George.

35:41.495 --> 35:43.495
Why would you lock yourself up with us?

35:43.497 --> 35:44.963
Pretend to be your own victim?

35:44.965 --> 35:47.633
Because it amuses me to watch your fear.

35:51.101 --> 35:53.201
I was born with the devil in me.

35:53.226 --> 35:54.773
I can't help the fact
that I'm a murderer,

35:54.775 --> 35:58.844
no more than the poet can
help the inspiration to sing.

35:59.328 --> 36:02.062
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't shoot you.

36:02.064 --> 36:03.591
I'll confess...

36:04.967 --> 36:07.334
to everything.

36:07.336 --> 36:11.365
Every life I've taken,
every body I've buried.

36:12.146 --> 36:16.276
I heard what you said
in that chamber, Wyatt.

36:16.278 --> 36:18.145
Your worst fear is not
knowing what happened

36:18.147 --> 36:20.091
to the people you love.

36:20.916 --> 36:23.974
Someone very important to you, right?

36:24.553 --> 36:29.519
Well, I can give my
victims' families closure.

36:30.907 --> 36:32.973
Is he telling the truth?

36:34.996 --> 36:37.197
- Wyatt...
- Does he say....

36:37.199 --> 36:39.287
where he buried the victims?

36:42.867 --> 36:46.233
No, he lies about everything
and sells his story for profit.

36:46.258 --> 36:48.825
She's a witch. She can't be trusted.

37:06.123 --> 37:07.286
Thank you.

37:07.311 --> 37:10.049
Just make sure you get
home to your dad, all right?

37:12.546 --> 37:13.953
I hope we meet again.

37:13.955 --> 37:16.554
Maybe at our class reunion.

37:17.492 --> 37:19.687
Police will be here in 20 minutes.

37:22.598 --> 37:24.665
Sure you can't come with me?

37:24.667 --> 37:26.133
We make a great team.

37:26.135 --> 37:29.136
And I could sure use an assistant.

37:29.138 --> 37:31.338
You'll find a better one soon.

37:31.340 --> 37:33.762
Keep a lookout for a...

37:33.787 --> 37:36.187
Bess, or an Annie, or a Frances,

37:36.212 --> 37:37.645
or a Bess.

37:37.670 --> 37:41.715
And you will go on to do
amazing things together.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.317
What makes you so sure?

37:43.319 --> 37:45.919
A magician never reveals her secrets.

37:48.691 --> 37:50.418
Gentlemen.

37:51.034 --> 37:52.535
Good luck.

37:57.133 --> 37:58.799
Hey, Houdini.

37:58.801 --> 38:00.701
Give me my damn gun back.

38:19.011 --> 38:21.033
For the record, um...

38:21.713 --> 38:23.223
I knew you guys were gonna save me.

38:23.248 --> 38:25.970
Well, you know, technically, I think...

38:25.995 --> 38:27.327
you saved us.

38:27.329 --> 38:30.264
Well, technically, yeah, you're right.

38:32.234 --> 38:34.068
Not bad for a civilian, right?

38:34.070 --> 38:35.903
No, not bad at all.

38:37.122 --> 38:38.421
Look at that.

38:38.674 --> 38:40.107
We got the team back.

38:45.014 --> 38:48.166
Okay, listen up, old Rittenhouse dude,

38:48.191 --> 38:50.666
whose name I still don't know.

38:52.054 --> 38:54.388
I'll do this job.

38:54.390 --> 38:55.756
I'll pilot the Lifeboat,

38:55.758 --> 38:58.759
and one day, we will catch Garcia Flynn.

38:58.761 --> 39:00.928
But I'm done being your errand boy.

39:02.027 --> 39:03.760
If you touch me

39:03.966 --> 39:05.866
or anyone in my family,

39:05.891 --> 39:08.391
or anyone I care about...

39:09.924 --> 39:11.290
I'm out.

39:11.315 --> 39:14.049
And if you have a problem with that,

39:14.074 --> 39:16.241
you can just find another pilot.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.317
Oh, wait.

39:19.874 --> 39:22.450
There is no other pilot.

39:22.754 --> 39:25.255
I'm all you've got.

39:25.421 --> 39:30.657
So back the hell off.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.202
This is my last recording.

39:46.642 --> 39:48.175
Give it to Rittenhouse.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.220
Rufus...

39:51.113 --> 39:53.040
Are you sure you want to do this?

39:54.583 --> 39:56.306
I'm sure.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.553
After what I've seen today...

40:02.024 --> 40:03.957
I'm not scared of Rittenhouse.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.719
I picked a side, Connor.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.377
You should pick one too.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.384
_

40:44.900 --> 40:46.200
This is Wyatt.

40:46.202 --> 40:47.901
Congratulations.

40:47.903 --> 40:50.671
You checked out of the
World's Fair Hotel alive.

40:50.673 --> 40:53.207
Lucy saved Edison, Ford, and Morgan,

40:53.209 --> 40:56.176
who went on to become some
of history's greatest dicks.

40:56.178 --> 40:57.578
How'd you get this number?

40:57.580 --> 40:59.794
Oh, and on top of all that,

40:59.819 --> 41:03.144
you got to kill America's
first serial killer.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.385
That must have felt great!

41:05.387 --> 41:06.687
What do you want, Flynn?

41:06.689 --> 41:08.322
We made a deal...

41:08.324 --> 41:10.381
that if you helped me
get Benedict Arnold,

41:10.406 --> 41:12.572
I'd give you the name
of your wife's killer.

41:12.597 --> 41:14.161
So despite what you think of me,

41:14.163 --> 41:15.529
I'm a man of my word.

41:15.531 --> 41:18.365
Now, the guy you're looking for...

41:18.719 --> 41:21.890
he's currently serving for two
other murders in San Quentin.

41:21.915 --> 41:24.504
And his name is Wes Gilliam.

41:27.399 --> 41:31.190
Now, we both know you can't go
back to any time you already exist,

41:31.192 --> 41:33.530
so it's not like you can stop the murder

41:33.555 --> 41:35.505
or even... even stop Wes. No.

41:35.530 --> 41:39.530
You'd have to go back
in time... further.

41:39.555 --> 41:41.088
Do something terrible

41:41.090 --> 41:43.857
to his poor, innocent parents, maybe?

41:45.361 --> 41:49.363
So the only question now, Wyatt, is...

41:51.419 --> 41:53.433
What are you gonna do about it?

41:59.664 --> 42:03.734
