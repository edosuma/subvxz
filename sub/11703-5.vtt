WEBVTT

00:00.082 --> 00:03.522
Time's up, Freak. Open the door
or Vinegar Tits gets it.

00:03.602 --> 00:04.661
No.

00:11.242 --> 00:13.961
What the fuck did the Freak
do to you in the slot?

00:14.082 --> 00:15.641
I think Ferguson got
to you in the slot.

00:15.762 --> 00:19.442
Did she give you the shiv, too?
I didn't have a choice!

00:19.561 --> 00:22.242
Mum. Mum!
We're having a drink!

00:22.321 --> 00:24.481
Franky and me are having a partay!

00:24.561 --> 00:26.041
Fuck you.

00:28.161 --> 00:32.002
An anonymous group of vigilantes
calling itself the Red Right Hand.

00:32.121 --> 00:34.481
We're taking a stand on violence
against women in the name of our

00:34.602 --> 00:37.801
hero, Bea Smith.
You don't like me.

00:37.922 --> 00:40.682
Why do you say that?
I remember.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.641 --> 01:30.762
You should be dead.

01:32.442 --> 01:36.201
Ms Ferguson, myself and the board
want you to know that we care about

01:36.281 --> 01:38.281
you, mate.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.762
And we're here to
help any way we can.

01:42.362 --> 01:44.402
Thank you.

01:44.522 --> 01:48.121
To that end, we'd like to
invite you back to work.

01:48.242 --> 01:52.682
The board has the idea that it would
be beneficial to your recovery.

01:52.802 --> 01:55.802
Light duties to begin with
until you find your feet again.

01:58.322 --> 02:01.882
Do I have to? No, no, no, no.
If I'm not mistaken,

02:02.002 --> 02:04.621
your insurance pay-out more than
compensates for any loss of income.

02:04.641 --> 02:06.881
But the Fletch I know would be
very keen to get back on

02:06.962 --> 02:09.322
the horse again if he could.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.801
Thank you.

02:13.322 --> 02:14.841
But I'm... I'm not ready.

02:17.641 --> 02:19.841
OK.
OK.

02:21.161 --> 02:23.281
You at least think about it, eh?

02:23.401 --> 02:26.601
If you change your mind,
your job is here waiting for you.

02:26.762 --> 02:31.961
All you have to do is call me.
You do whatever you need to get better.

02:34.161 --> 02:35.241
I will.

02:44.241 --> 02:48.201
I'm assuming that the board didn't
come to this idea spontaneously.

02:49.801 --> 02:51.561
Maddock tabled it, actually.

02:53.121 --> 02:56.441
He feels that we owe Matt for
all his years of good service.

02:56.561 --> 02:58.961
It would suit you to have
him back here, wouldn't it?

02:59.042 --> 03:00.521
Your little

03:00.601 --> 03:02.441
broken puppet.

03:06.361 --> 03:08.001
Fletch, how'd it go?

03:08.121 --> 03:10.921
You knew about it?
You could have warned me, Vera.

03:14.521 --> 03:17.001
What'd he have to say for himself?

03:17.081 --> 03:19.681
Just that he's not coming back.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.921
Are you still unwell?
Oh, it's just this flu.

03:22.042 --> 03:24.401
I can't seem to shake it.
You should see a doctor.

03:25.961 --> 03:28.561
If it's not gone
by tomorrow, I will.

04:17.161 --> 04:20.961
'Hi, this is Fletch.
Leave a message after the tone.'

04:21.081 --> 04:22.921
'Hi. This is a message for
Matthew Fletcher.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.641
'Could you please call
the Milton Private Rehabilitation,

04:25.762 --> 04:28.521
'regarding an unsettled account?
The number here is

04:28.601 --> 04:32.002
'965 71212. Thanks.'

05:24.002 --> 05:27.682
What is she saying to her?
Sophie's not stupid.

05:27.801 --> 05:30.481
She'll figure out Franky
soon enough, you watch.

05:31.921 --> 05:35.281
Far out! Is it me
or is it cold in here?

05:35.401 --> 05:37.882
Ms Miles, what's going on
with the heating?

05:38.002 --> 05:40.641
Not on until the start of winter.
Governor's orders.

05:40.801 --> 05:44.041
Oh, what are we supposed to do
till then? Freeze our fricken' tits off?

05:44.161 --> 05:47.562
Wear more clothes. Or take it up
with the Governor. As if.

05:47.641 --> 05:50.122
The Freak's punishing us.

05:50.201 --> 05:52.601
Well, can't you do something?

05:52.622 --> 05:53.741
Not now.
Well, if you're not

05:53.762 --> 05:56.041
going to do anything about it,
I'm going to the Governor myself.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.322
No-one goes near her.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.041
No. Bea wants a word with you.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.841
Have you changed your mind?
Cos that's the only reason

06:10.921 --> 06:13.281
why you'd be in here.

06:13.361 --> 06:14.841
Please, Bea, I'm starving.

06:14.961 --> 06:18.721
Yeah, I bet you are. But you're
not eating until you do it.

06:49.762 --> 06:52.281
Are you doing the right
thing by Liz's girl?

06:52.361 --> 06:54.281
Liz made a complaint, has she?

06:54.361 --> 06:56.201
She doesn't like it.

06:56.322 --> 06:58.641
But I think Sophie needs
to be around good people.

06:58.762 --> 07:03.401
That's just between you and me.
Can I have a seat?

07:05.801 --> 07:08.641
Whatever you're trying with Jodes,
it won't work.

07:10.322 --> 07:12.882
I need your help. What makes
you think I want to help you?

07:12.961 --> 07:14.521
Because I'm asking nicely.

07:16.961 --> 07:20.241
We have to get Jodie
to report on Ferguson.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.161
OK, I fucked up.

07:29.921 --> 07:33.161
You warned me about the Freak
and I thought I knew better.

07:35.882 --> 07:37.481
Sorry.

07:37.562 --> 07:39.521
Not interested.

07:45.201 --> 07:49.961
Hey! Don't you want
to make Ferguson pay?

07:50.041 --> 07:51.562
What, and give Jodie more grief?

07:51.682 --> 07:53.442
What you did to her
is fucked enough.

07:53.521 --> 07:55.401
You don't get it, do you?

07:55.521 --> 07:57.721
Someone had to take the fall for
the drugs. If it wasn't her,

07:57.841 --> 08:00.481
it was going to be you. You were
the one that she wanted all along.

08:00.601 --> 08:05.122
Fuck. You still care
about Jodie, don't ya?

08:05.201 --> 08:07.081
You were in the slot with her.

08:07.201 --> 08:09.762
You must have some sense of what
Ferguson was doing to her to get

08:09.841 --> 08:11.841
her to shiv me.

08:11.921 --> 08:14.122
Now we can take the Freak down.

08:14.201 --> 08:15.641
Together.

08:18.961 --> 08:20.021
Jodie!

08:20.682 --> 08:22.521
Hey.

08:22.641 --> 08:24.622
Franky's gonna keep you
company for a little bit.

08:25.322 --> 08:28.641
Get off the bed.
Go! Up against the wall.

08:28.762 --> 08:31.722
Don't look at me.
See you in a few hours.

08:31.801 --> 08:33.081
Yep.

08:34.522 --> 08:37.722
Fuck. Please don't do this to me...
Shut the fuck up.

08:38.322 --> 08:39.761
Turn around.

08:46.242 --> 08:49.282
If you're downloading porn, all I can
say is don't use a prison computer.

08:49.402 --> 08:51.682
I was checking
the headlines, actually.

08:51.802 --> 08:54.482
I heard Fletch's been
allowed to come back.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.722
He was asked. He said no.
Oh, I'm surprised Ferguson even

08:57.802 --> 08:59.842
considered it. Why?

08:59.961 --> 09:02.682
Thought she'd be happy
to be rid of him.

09:02.762 --> 09:04.242
I am aware

09:04.362 --> 09:07.322
that Mr Fletcher and the Governor
have had their differences in

09:07.442 --> 09:10.242
the past, but in this situation,
the welfare of the staff member

09:10.322 --> 09:12.402
is her top priority. OK.

09:12.522 --> 09:14.442
Oh, you don't agree?
You of all people think

09:14.522 --> 09:16.482
Ferguson cares about her staff?

09:16.562 --> 09:18.442
What's that supposed to mean?

09:20.362 --> 09:23.362
The riot,
when you were held hostage?

09:23.482 --> 09:25.402
Ferguson wouldn't open
the door to isolation.

09:25.522 --> 09:27.882
No, that's not true.
The door was opened.

09:27.961 --> 09:30.522
That was Channing. He overruled her.

09:30.642 --> 09:34.882
They had a syringe to your throat
and she wouldn't move an inch.

09:37.842 --> 09:40.722
We don't negotiate with prisoners.
You know the policy.

09:41.242 --> 09:42.302
OK.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.362
Hey. Hi.

10:32.961 --> 10:36.242
I'm sorry, the place
is a bit of a mess.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.602
Why did you say no?

10:48.562 --> 10:52.602
Why was the offer even made?
I mean, Ferguson

10:52.722 --> 10:54.442
doesn't want me there.
Yes, she does.

10:54.461 --> 10:56.062
Bullshit. She was saying
all the right things,

10:56.122 --> 11:00.362
but she doesn't want a bar of it.
It would have been Channing's idea.

11:00.482 --> 11:02.162
Well, none of
it would have been proposed

11:02.242 --> 11:04.922
if Ms Ferguson hadn't agreed to it.

11:05.042 --> 11:08.242
You know she's been following
your progress closely?

11:11.042 --> 11:12.642
She cares about you.

11:14.242 --> 11:15.682
As we all do.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.842
You've got to get out of here.

11:19.961 --> 11:22.961
You need discipline, you need
routine. You know that.

11:23.042 --> 11:24.322
I know it's hard.

11:25.802 --> 11:28.201
I really do.
But sometimes challenges

11:28.282 --> 11:30.162
are the best things for us.

11:32.802 --> 11:34.522
You know at the hospital?

11:38.402 --> 11:42.002
All I could think about
was getting better.

11:42.081 --> 11:43.602
But I...

11:43.682 --> 11:46.122
I didn't think about what

11:46.201 --> 11:47.642
"better" meant.

11:51.762 --> 11:53.802
This is better.

11:55.162 --> 11:57.562
I mean, this is it.

11:57.642 --> 11:59.201
Can't do it, Vera.

12:04.081 --> 12:08.802
I can't walk properly,
I can't think properly.

12:08.922 --> 12:12.762
I'm never... I'm never gonna
get back to the way I was, you know?

12:16.842 --> 12:18.961
I wanna get better.

12:48.263 --> 12:49.325
Oi!

12:56.685 --> 12:58.569
No! No!
Doreen. Hey, hey, hey.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.537
Wake up, wake up! Shh.
It's OK, it's OK.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.624
Hey, it's me. It's Bea. You were
just having a bad dream, honey.

13:04.746 --> 13:07.632
You were just having a bad dream.
It's OK.

13:11.363 --> 13:12.486
What's happened to Doreen?

13:12.606 --> 13:14.932
Nothing. Go to bed.
But I want to come.

13:15.012 --> 13:16.656
I said go to bed, Warner.

13:22.472 --> 13:24.998
The baby's dead... Yeah.

13:25.119 --> 13:30.332
..and then there's a mound of
dirt and it's a grave.

13:30.452 --> 13:34.343
And then there was another baby
putting stones on top of it.

13:34.423 --> 13:36.268
And it was Ella.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.193
Ella was your first.

13:42.083 --> 13:45.773
Darling, nothing is gonna happen
to this little baby.

13:45.893 --> 13:49.302
It was so real.
I know, I know.

13:49.422 --> 13:52.630
How far along were
you when you lost Ella?

13:52.711 --> 13:55.318
Um, like, 32 weeks or something.

13:55.438 --> 13:57.563
You're about that now, yeah?
Yeah.

13:57.684 --> 14:01.694
Oh, love, I reckon that's what's
playing on your mind.

14:01.815 --> 14:04.381
Maybe.
Yeah, I think so.

14:04.502 --> 14:08.071
But you are healthy.
This bubby's healthy.

14:08.191 --> 14:11.360
Nothing is gonna go wrong
this time, alright?

14:11.480 --> 14:16.132
You promise?
I promise. I promise, I promise.

14:16.212 --> 14:18.538
Oh, darling, it's alright.

14:19.541 --> 14:21.225
Oh, sweetie.
It's OK, it's OK.

14:38.952 --> 14:40.596
Hello, Mr Fletcher.

14:41.117 --> 14:42.180
Hey.

14:56.598 --> 14:58.202
He is not to work
general population.

14:58.322 --> 15:01.130
Restricted to public side only,
reception and visitors.

15:03.295 --> 15:08.308
And he is not to be
given a swipe card.

15:08.388 --> 15:09.872
I'll see to it.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.998
I wonder what changed his mind.

15:17.773 --> 15:22.906
I'm terrified I'm gonna
lose bubs and I realise

15:22.986 --> 15:24.350
I'll never know Ella.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.120
That's all really normal, love.

15:28.842 --> 15:31.489
Thanks, Liz.
Oh, Liz has been really great.

15:31.569 --> 15:33.213
Yeah, good on you, Liz.

15:33.293 --> 15:35.138
Oh, and Jess, too.

15:36.542 --> 15:39.710
Good. So, surrounding yourself
with positive, supportive people

15:39.789 --> 15:41.435
helps, yeah? Yeah.

15:41.515 --> 15:43.721
We keeping you up, Jodie?

15:47.531 --> 15:51.541
I punch shit.
You know, when I'm stressed.

15:53.145 --> 15:55.913
So, what do you punch? Walls?

15:55.993 --> 15:57.797
Doors? People?

15:57.878 --> 16:00.003
Anything I think's shit.

16:00.404 --> 16:04.134
I mean, I'm in here cos I punched
me counsellor, actually.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.526
Booms, don't you get why
you're here? She's one of

16:08.546 --> 16:10.471
the sign-offs for your parole.
Alright, just so we're clear,

16:10.551 --> 16:12.356
whatever's said in these sessions

16:12.476 --> 16:15.845
doesn't form part of my
recommendations to the Parole Board.

16:15.965 --> 16:18.933
Oh, so we don't
even have to be here?

16:19.053 --> 16:20.076
You don't...
Oh, sweet.

16:20.096 --> 16:23.104
..but when you apply for your parole,
you get to tick a box

16:23.224 --> 16:25.269
to say that you were involved in
the program, which the Parole Board

16:25.349 --> 16:27.515
looks on as a plus.

16:27.635 --> 16:29.601
Right. So we can
say whatever we like.

16:29.721 --> 16:32.769
Yeah, within reason.
I'd like to hear Franky talk.

16:35.977 --> 16:37.742
I'll talk when I've got
something to talk about.

16:37.862 --> 16:40.589
Come on, a problem shared
is a problem halved.

16:40.669 --> 16:41.712
Isn't that what they say?

16:41.832 --> 16:44.720
We don't make anybody talk
if they don't want to, Liz.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.169
Come on, you heard her.
You can say whatever you like.

16:48.189 --> 16:50.415
So if you've got any blood on
your hands, now's the time to

16:50.495 --> 16:52.019
wash some of it off.

16:52.139 --> 16:54.004
Keep it up, Liz,
I'll have to ask you to leave.

16:54.024 --> 16:56.792
That's fine by me.
I'll talk.

16:59.037 --> 17:00.441
Sit down.

17:04.330 --> 17:07.057
How's this for
a stressful situation?

17:07.179 --> 17:10.867
Someone I used to care about's
got a daughter in here.

17:10.989 --> 17:15.319
Pissed, on her Ps,
and killed a cyclist.

17:16.122 --> 17:19.609
It's terrible. Terrible, but you'd
think as a first offender,

17:19.691 --> 17:21.496
she'd get bail, not end up in here.

17:21.615 --> 17:23.902
There's a reason why
she didn't get bail.

17:24.022 --> 17:26.228
Franky, I'm going to call that.
That's it...

17:26.308 --> 17:27.953
No, no, I want to know. Why?

17:29.918 --> 17:33.887
Cos it wasn't her first offence.
She'd been done for

17:34.009 --> 17:37.617
drink-driving and she was driving
on a cancelled licence.

17:37.738 --> 17:42.752
Turns out she's quite the little
piss pot, just like her mum.

17:42.832 --> 17:44.316
I'm surprised she didn't tell you.

17:45.678 --> 17:47.643
How do you deal with stress, Liz?

17:55.670 --> 17:57.314
Whoo!

18:03.174 --> 18:05.862
Sophie, can I...? Come here.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.952
Franky. Just give me a minute.

18:11.997 --> 18:13.542
Blood on my hands?
What the hell was that all about?

18:13.562 --> 18:15.267
You know exactly.
Are you trying to fuck my parole?

18:15.287 --> 18:20.059
Stay away from my daughter.
Are you trying to fuck my parole?

18:20.179 --> 18:22.986
You think things are bad now,
you fuckin' keep talking shit

18:23.009 --> 18:25.935
like that, and I'm gonna make your
life a complete fuckin' misery.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.943
Jacs Holt killed Meg Jackson.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.948
Now fuck off.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.401
Soph, can I please
have a word with you, darl?

18:37.527 --> 18:38.529
Soph?

18:39.491 --> 18:41.417
Let's get into it.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.302
Yeah! Whoo!

18:43.382 --> 18:44.464
Come on, Franky. Shoot!

18:44.545 --> 18:45.608
Shitface! Catch!

18:57.940 --> 19:02.351
Roster for you, Governor.
Thank you.

19:02.472 --> 19:05.359
I see you got Matt Fletcher
back here.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.209
Only on light duties
while he recovers.

19:09.329 --> 19:11.736
He'll return to full duties
if and when he's ready.

19:11.855 --> 19:14.423
Right.
Do you think it's a mistake?

19:14.503 --> 19:15.907
What if there's an incident?

19:16.027 --> 19:19.074
I don't think he can look after
himself, let alone anyone else.

19:19.195 --> 19:22.243
You're sure there isn't just a touch
of personal feeling creeping

19:22.323 --> 19:24.087
into this? Course not.

19:24.209 --> 19:28.821
We help our own, Mr Jackson,
in good times and bad.

19:31.468 --> 19:33.312
Ah, just a moment.

19:33.433 --> 19:38.245
I...I see that Smith is expecting
a visitor today, a Ms Proctor.

19:38.365 --> 19:41.093
What do you know about her?
Uh, Proctor's been writing to her.

19:41.213 --> 19:45.705
She's supportive of what
Smith did to Brayden Holt.

19:45.825 --> 19:48.753
Smith said anything else about it?
Not that I've heard, no.

19:48.873 --> 19:52.763
I think it might be wise for you not
to be the one to scrutinise Smith's

19:52.883 --> 19:54.989
mail, until your matters before
the police are settled.

19:55.009 --> 19:57.434
Just precautionary. You know,
they'll be looking very closely at

19:57.454 --> 20:00.383
the relationship between the two
of you. Let's not give them any more

20:00.462 --> 20:02.148
ammunition than they already have.

20:05.797 --> 20:06.860
Yes, Governor.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.778
Kaz Proctor.
I'm here to see Bea Smith.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.874
You right?

20:19.954 --> 20:21.718
Er, uh, who... who'd you say?

20:21.839 --> 20:24.887
Kaz Proctor. For Bea Smith.
I have been approved.

20:27.012 --> 20:28.577
Karen Proctor.

20:28.697 --> 20:31.744
Oh, right.
Well... well, you said Kaz.

20:31.825 --> 20:34.111
Karen, Kaz. Jesus, how hard is it?

20:34.231 --> 20:36.757
Your driver's licence,
uh, Ms Proctor, please.

20:40.648 --> 20:42.172
Sign in there, please.

20:53.482 --> 20:55.647
Did you get your money's worth?

20:55.768 --> 20:58.333
You've been eyeing me off
since I got here.

20:58.455 --> 21:01.904
Is that how you treat the members
of the public? Or just the females?

21:13.454 --> 21:15.058
I'm Kaz.

21:15.177 --> 21:16.983
Hi.
Hi.

21:24.603 --> 21:27.049
I can't believe we're actually
face-to-face, finally.

21:28.171 --> 21:30.939
The inspiration you have
been to so many women.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.425
Women who have been
victims of abuse

21:33.546 --> 21:36.212
their whole lives are standing up
and fighting back because of you.

21:36.232 --> 21:39.602
Look, I'm not a victim, alright?
Let's get that straight. OK.

21:39.681 --> 21:41.486
Look, Kaz, what I've done is

21:41.607 --> 21:44.014
what I've done, alright?
Welcome back, Fletch.

21:44.134 --> 21:46.901
I have my reasons.
It's nobody else's business.

21:46.980 --> 21:48.626
I'm not your mascot.

21:49.988 --> 21:51.713
"Righteous act of retribution"?

21:52.917 --> 21:56.125
That's you, yeah?
You're Red Right Hand.

21:56.245 --> 21:59.533
You know, for every ten metres
a woman walks away from her home,

21:59.655 --> 22:03.144
she doubles her chances of
not being abused or murdered.

22:03.263 --> 22:06.752
Home is the most dangerous place
for a woman, as you would know.

22:06.873 --> 22:09.760
That's gotta change.
Hey, look, my husband was murdered.

22:09.881 --> 22:13.090
There's an ongoing
investigation, right?

22:13.210 --> 22:15.575
When you go out there and you
commit crimes in my name,

22:15.696 --> 22:17.320
it doesn't exactly help me.
They can't possibly think

22:17.340 --> 22:19.586
that you did it.
Well, they start with

22:19.707 --> 22:22.915
the people closest to the victim.
Your husband wasn't a victim.

22:23.035 --> 22:26.244
He was the abuser and
he didn't deserve to live.

22:28.530 --> 22:31.376
Now you're gonna stop writing to me.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.703
You're gonna stop using my name.

22:33.823 --> 22:36.150
I don't ever want to see
you here again.

22:36.270 --> 22:39.397
They're pressuring you, aren't they?
No, no, no, I'm telling you to stop.

22:39.519 --> 22:42.687
What have they done?
We can help you.

22:42.807 --> 22:45.494
You have no idea how many
supporters you have through

22:45.614 --> 22:47.619
the police and
the Department of Justice.

22:47.740 --> 22:51.309
Well, I don't want anything to
do with you or your group.

22:51.429 --> 22:54.677
Hey, let go of her. Let go of her!
Jesus Christ!

22:54.799 --> 22:57.967
What have you done to her?
You will leave now.

22:58.087 --> 22:59.751
Not before you tell me
what you've done to her.

22:59.772 --> 23:02.017
You will leave now.
If I have to ask you again,

23:02.098 --> 23:03.941
you'll be forcibly removed.

23:04.063 --> 23:06.990
Escort Smith back
to her unit, please.

23:08.113 --> 23:09.557
We won't give up on you, Bea.
That's it. Let's go.

23:09.637 --> 23:11.282
Please, this way.

23:21.428 --> 23:23.112
Hey, Mr Jackson, can
I please have a word?

23:23.232 --> 23:27.043
I'll take her from here.
Hey, that woman,

23:27.163 --> 23:29.409
Kaz Proctor, came to see me.
Yeah, I heard things got a bit

23:29.488 --> 23:31.533
heated between you two. Yeah.

23:31.655 --> 23:35.425
You know the video on the news
of the guy getting beaten up? Yeah.

23:35.544 --> 23:39.916
Well, I think she's part of
that group. The Red Right Hand.

23:40.036 --> 23:42.803
What, she said that to you?
Not in so many words,

23:42.924 --> 23:46.252
but I think that
they might have killed Harry.

23:47.376 --> 23:48.819
For me.

23:52.588 --> 23:55.556
There you go.
Sorry, excuse me.

24:04.099 --> 24:05.863
Nice chatting to you, too, mate.

24:10.677 --> 24:14.246
You asked for me, Governor?
Yes.

24:15.889 --> 24:19.580
How is, uh, Mr Fletcher going?
Uh, very well,

24:19.700 --> 24:22.267
I believe. There was an issue
with Bea Smith's visitor...

24:22.386 --> 24:26.878
Yes, no, I saw. He handled that
rather well, I thought.

24:28.964 --> 24:31.691
It's funny, you know.
He seems to be at

24:31.772 --> 24:34.378
one moment struggling, and then

24:34.499 --> 24:37.025
he appears to be quite
able and proactive.

24:37.106 --> 24:38.549
Well I suppose his injuries

24:38.669 --> 24:41.717
make some things
more challenging than others.

24:41.838 --> 24:45.889
Or he is inconsistent
about what he shows us.

24:45.968 --> 24:47.933
I highly doubt he's faking it.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.545
Well, you'd know better than anyone.

24:52.667 --> 24:56.521
You've been with him for so
much of the journey.

24:56.642 --> 24:58.610
How're you feeling?
Did you see a doctor?

24:58.731 --> 24:59.734
I did. And...
And?

24:59.854 --> 25:01.079
..it's a cold, apparently.
You sure you wouldn't be

25:01.099 --> 25:03.047
better off at home?
Oh, I... I'd really rather not.

25:03.067 --> 25:05.316
Just until you're feeling...
If you don't mind.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.805
..100%. I have things to do, so...
Hmm.

25:07.886 --> 25:09.894
Well, offer's there.

25:12.545 --> 25:15.153
Hey. Anything?

25:20.737 --> 25:22.263
Can I have that?

25:24.993 --> 25:27.604
Fuck! Hi, Jodie.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.828
Jesus.

25:35.915 --> 25:37.963
Here, you should drink something.

25:49.931 --> 25:51.336
You've gotta stop that.

25:52.340 --> 25:54.589
It's not good for you.
I can't.

25:56.115 --> 26:01.255
Look, I know you think I'm the enemy,
but I'm not. She is. OK?

26:01.375 --> 26:03.865
So if you just tell us what she did
to you then this will all be over.

26:03.946 --> 26:04.949
I can't.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.847
I can't!
OK.

26:10.732 --> 26:12.419
Alright.

26:12.539 --> 26:15.471
Then there's only one
way this is gonna end.

26:20.731 --> 26:24.866
We've got to stop her from hurting herself.
She goes to medical, she's out of our reach.

26:24.988 --> 26:27.436
Right. There's also
the other reason.

26:28.441 --> 26:31.693
What?
She might actually hurt herself.

26:33.460 --> 26:36.995
Just don't forget why
she ended up in the slot, OK?

26:37.075 --> 26:39.324
It was us who put her there.

27:03.016 --> 27:04.300
Hello?

27:06.189 --> 27:07.956
Karen Proctor?

27:10.967 --> 27:14.220
Who are you? Are you
Karen Proctor of Red Right Hand?

27:14.299 --> 27:15.545
Get off my property.

27:15.666 --> 27:18.596
You're one of them, aren't you?
Red Right Hand?

27:18.718 --> 27:20.926
Get off my property
or I will call the police.

27:21.047 --> 27:23.335
Good. Call them, cos
it'd be a really interesting

27:23.456 --> 27:25.904
conversation there, Karen. Eh?
Fuck off!

27:26.026 --> 27:29.279
Whoa! So that's how
you deal with shit, is it?

27:35.503 --> 27:40.441
Nice, Proctor. Nice.
Who the fuck are you?

27:41.959 --> 27:43.752
Who the fuck are you?

27:54.603 --> 27:56.866
Is everything alright?

27:56.885 --> 27:58.928
Mm, yeah.
I brought you a tea.

27:59.008 --> 28:00.289
Thank you.

28:02.172 --> 28:05.256
You'll be OK. So will the bub.
I know.

28:08.579 --> 28:10.743
You know, I loved being a nanny.

28:12.506 --> 28:14.347
The baby, Madison.

28:14.908 --> 28:17.752
Yeah, I loved her
like she was my own.

28:20.155 --> 28:21.758
But she died.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.961
Of cot death.

28:26.564 --> 28:28.006
And that was it.

28:29.968 --> 28:34.254
Her father rang me and said, "Your
services are no longer required."

28:37.898 --> 28:41.584
They didn't think that maybe
it was more than just a job to me.

28:46.911 --> 28:49.034
I'm so sorry, Jess.

28:53.919 --> 28:55.724
But Madison's still alive in me.

28:58.366 --> 29:03.692
Sometimes I imagine that
we go to the park and play,

29:03.814 --> 29:07.858
and I buy her a baby-cino
and people stop and tell me

29:07.938 --> 29:09.862
what a beautiful girl I've got.

29:10.863 --> 29:14.667
And I like to think about
her first day of school,

29:14.747 --> 29:19.635
her first kiss, and her first love.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.758
She's got a perfect life.

29:23.439 --> 29:24.761
Really perfect.

29:26.163 --> 29:28.406
You could give
the same thing to Ella.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.931
Yeah.

29:32.052 --> 29:35.616
All you've gotta do is shut
your eyes and make it real.

29:37.257 --> 29:40.102
Really? Do you want
to give it a go?

29:40.221 --> 29:42.786
OK.
Can you see her?

29:45.748 --> 29:47.311
She'd be three now.

29:47.432 --> 29:51.116
Would she like to come
on a play date with Maddy?

29:51.197 --> 29:52.839
Yeah.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.123
Meet you at the lake by
the Botanical Gardens.

29:56.242 --> 29:59.767
I hate swans.
Then there won't be any.

30:03.492 --> 30:05.775
There won't be any at all.

30:17.192 --> 30:18.633
Hey.

30:20.595 --> 30:24.360
This is only gonna get worse.
She's not gonna give in.

30:24.481 --> 30:27.926
It's the only thing you can do,
Jodie. We will protect you.

30:28.045 --> 30:30.128
You have to do this.
Miss Miles!

30:31.288 --> 30:34.414
I'm not feeling very well.
Need to go to medical?

30:39.299 --> 30:41.263
Well?
She'll be OK, won't ya?

30:41.342 --> 30:43.426
I'll look after you.

30:48.552 --> 30:51.877
Sophie, why couldn't you tell me
about driving without a licence?

30:51.998 --> 30:56.643
I'm your mum for god's sake. I'd be
the last person to judge you.

30:56.802 --> 31:00.809
I don't wanna talk about it. I know you don't
wanna talk about it and that's fine.

31:00.929 --> 31:04.453
Just stay away from Franky, love.
She's only gonna use you. Soph!

31:11.422 --> 31:13.426
G'day. Thanks.

31:14.668 --> 31:16.348
How's it going?

31:16.430 --> 31:18.513
Anything you want to talk about?

31:18.632 --> 31:21.957
Why don't you start off today?
I'm sick of talking about me.

31:22.037 --> 31:24.000
Well, we're here to talk

31:24.119 --> 31:25.722
about you, Franky.
You're the one who

31:25.841 --> 31:28.966
breached the trust.
Onus is on you to rebuild.

31:29.086 --> 31:32.370
And I've acknowledged that
I compromised that and I'm sorry,

31:32.491 --> 31:34.734
but we cannot keep going
round that circle, yeah?

31:34.815 --> 31:36.576
Trust is a two-way street.

31:36.696 --> 31:40.501
You know all about me, so why don't
you tell me about yourself?

31:40.582 --> 31:42.383
I want dirt.

31:42.505 --> 31:46.389
Well, I can't give you dirt,
you know that.

31:46.509 --> 31:50.115
There's a whole host of reasons
for the therapist not to bring

31:50.195 --> 31:52.157
their personal lives into the room.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.960
So you're just a wall I talk at.
I get nothing back.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.924
If you were the prison psych, you'd be
damned careful what you told anyone.

31:58.044 --> 32:01.649
You're the one who's got to
do the work, Gidget, not me.

32:04.053 --> 32:07.377
Was Liz Birdsworth
someone you trusted?

32:09.100 --> 32:10.822
Did that bother you?

32:10.941 --> 32:13.665
The way I pulled her
to bits like that?

32:13.746 --> 32:15.588
She provoked you. Mm.

32:15.708 --> 32:19.432
Your only form of defence seems
to be attack, so you did pretty much

32:19.513 --> 32:21.156
what I'd expect of you.

32:21.276 --> 32:24.320
When was your first
time with a woman?

32:25.762 --> 32:26.824
OK.

32:27.684 --> 32:30.408
Why did you change the subject?
When?

32:31.649 --> 32:34.253
Was it because I said
you acted predictably?

32:34.373 --> 32:36.735
I know you're a dyke.
Why won't you answer my question?

32:36.817 --> 32:38.458
Answer mine.

32:40.261 --> 32:43.585
The way you eviscerated Liz,
was that supposed to impress me?

32:43.705 --> 32:46.749
Why would I want to impress you?
Has my sexuality got anything to do

32:46.870 --> 32:51.356
with it? You can't blame me for
thinking there's a connection.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.202
It's simpler when
we stick to you, yeah?

32:57.242 --> 32:59.647
Yes, I am a lesbian.

33:01.528 --> 33:03.491
Now can we move on?

33:07.176 --> 33:08.238
Yep.

33:34.733 --> 33:36.015
Mr Fletcher.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.379
Governor.

33:51.756 --> 33:54.318
I hope your day's
going well for you.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.962
Thank you.

34:10.541 --> 34:13.304
Fuck, please, Franky,
just let me rest.

34:13.425 --> 34:17.829
Sorry, Jodie.
Oh, god. Just let me sleep.

34:17.949 --> 34:21.114
I'm gonna fucking die.
It's torture.

34:21.195 --> 34:23.637
Don't shiv the top dog.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.201
Chocky?

34:36.174 --> 34:37.996
I reckon she'll be pretty hungry,
too, yeah? What's it been,

34:38.016 --> 34:41.181
four or five days since she's eaten?
Yeah, something like that.

34:41.302 --> 34:44.424
Although I heard that you can go
for months without eating before

34:44.545 --> 34:46.107
it actually kills you.
Yeah,

34:46.226 --> 34:47.811
as long as you keep your fluids up.
Yeah.

34:47.831 --> 34:51.154
Otherwise, it's just a matter of
days before you, you know...

34:51.274 --> 34:53.757
It's heart failure.
Hmm?

34:54.518 --> 34:56.842
Heart failure, that's what kills
you. Once the fat reserves

34:56.960 --> 34:59.965
are gone your body starts taking
energy from the muscles

35:00.086 --> 35:02.008
and they start wasting away.
Huh.

35:02.129 --> 35:04.531
Because the heart's a muscle.
Right.

35:04.611 --> 35:08.136
Yeah. Hey, I've got this.

35:08.217 --> 35:10.220
Why don't you go rest? OK.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.543
I'm fuckin' rooted.
Yeah?

35:14.184 --> 35:16.467
See you in a few hours, Jodie.

35:22.397 --> 35:25.800
Bea, I can't do what you want!

35:27.683 --> 35:29.485
So please just stop.

35:47.028 --> 35:48.590
Mr Jackson.

35:51.395 --> 35:52.896
Will Jackson,
what have you got to say

35:52.916 --> 35:56.200
about allegations that
you murdered Harry Smith? What?

35:56.320 --> 35:59.764
You're assisting police
with their enquiries. Yes.

35:59.886 --> 36:02.249
Did you kill him?
What's your relationship to

36:02.369 --> 36:05.253
the victim's ex-wife, Bea Smith?
Are prison authorities aware

36:05.373 --> 36:08.256
of the allegations against you?
Does Bea Smith know?

36:10.219 --> 36:13.824
What if it was the police that
leaked the information about you?

36:13.984 --> 36:18.350
Would they do that? You know, to rattle
his cage, as it were. See what falls out.

36:18.431 --> 36:20.874
What do you think I should do?

36:22.074 --> 36:24.157
The allegations against you are...

36:24.598 --> 36:26.881
Well, they're just that,
they're allegations.

36:27.002 --> 36:30.005
You have our confidence.
Isn't that right, Derek?

36:31.327 --> 36:33.049
Well, the board are concerned,
obviously,

36:33.130 --> 36:34.772
but Ms Ferguson is correct.

36:34.891 --> 36:37.254
They are just allegations
at this point.

36:38.776 --> 36:42.302
I can't tell you what that
means to me. Thank you.

36:45.225 --> 36:47.108
Go through the metal detector...

36:49.620 --> 36:51.543
Linda.
Fletch.

36:51.623 --> 36:53.517
Welcome back.

37:02.798 --> 37:05.922
Look, Fletch, I'm sorry
I didn't come visit you.

37:06.206 --> 37:07.968
Oh, it's alright.

37:08.087 --> 37:11.052
No, I should have...
Linda, it's alright.

37:12.107 --> 37:13.670
Personally, I hate hospitals.

37:14.950 --> 37:18.796
And you're OK? Yeah, I'm back to
my old self. Good as gold.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.003
I gotta go.

37:33.536 --> 37:36.059
Hello, Mr Fletcher.

37:55.365 --> 37:57.567
Mr Fletcher?

37:57.648 --> 37:59.170
Hi.

37:59.290 --> 38:01.813
Uh, what...
Jess.

38:01.894 --> 38:03.335
Yeah. Jess.

38:05.498 --> 38:07.982
How are you?
I'm good.

38:08.863 --> 38:11.025
I heard you got run over.

38:11.106 --> 38:13.188
Yeah, I'm... I'm better now.

38:14.870 --> 38:18.515
Here, let me.
Thank you.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.723
I still think about it.
About what?

38:25.845 --> 38:26.906
Us.

38:30.131 --> 38:31.933
There's no-one here, Mr Fletcher.

38:35.698 --> 38:39.063
I'm... I'm sorry.
Listen, I'm sorry. I... I...

38:39.182 --> 38:41.626
It's OK.
No, I've gotta go.

38:42.667 --> 38:43.729
Mr Fletcher.

38:46.593 --> 38:48.355
Where is it?

38:48.476 --> 38:51.078
Where's my card?
I don't know where...

38:51.199 --> 38:54.043
Give me my fucking card!
Where's my fucking card?

38:54.162 --> 38:55.965
Let go of me!
I don't know where your card is!

38:55.965 --> 38:58.048
Mr Fletcher!
Mr Fletcher, it's alright.

38:58.168 --> 39:01.453
I've got a card.
Get back to your cell.

39:02.734 --> 39:05.217
Come with me. Come on.
Come on.

39:09.688 --> 39:14.156
The day before your accident,
you lost your swipe card.

39:14.229 --> 39:16.514
We worked it out
after Bea Smith escaped.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.010
What, she used it to escape?

39:19.131 --> 39:22.897
No, no, not quite. She used it to
access contraband, a knife,

39:22.946 --> 39:26.069
which she used in a fight
with Doyle. No, no, no.

39:26.189 --> 39:29.153
It was the right
decision to come back.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.398
I think it's helping you remember.

39:37.325 --> 39:39.288
Vera, I'm scared.

39:45.695 --> 39:47.898
I don't think I want to remember.

39:53.467 --> 39:55.510
..ex-wife, Bea Smith...

39:55.628 --> 39:59.112
It's Mr Jackson. Hey, Bea! Bea!
Yeah?

39:59.234 --> 40:02.557
Come here.
Does Bea Smith know?

40:02.678 --> 40:05.961
Look at this.
Corrections officer Mr Jackson

40:06.082 --> 40:08.966
was also the subject of
an investigation into Bea Smith's

40:09.085 --> 40:10.889
dramatic escape...
What the fuck?

40:11.009 --> 40:14.814
..that led to the murder of
criminal identity Brayden Holt.

40:14.934 --> 40:17.337
Although Mr Jackson was cleared
of any criminal wrongdoing in

40:17.417 --> 40:20.622
that matter, we are led to believe,
by a reliable source,

40:20.742 --> 40:24.346
that he is now the prime suspect
for the murder of Harry Smith.

40:24.467 --> 40:27.791
This is Hayley Jovanka
with this Channel 8 exclusive.

40:29.034 --> 40:31.155
Staff room. Yeah, put her through.

40:32.157 --> 40:36.683
Will Jackson speaking.
I know who you are now.

40:45.013 --> 40:47.217
Come in.
Jodie's got something to say.

40:49.619 --> 40:51.181
I'll do it.

41:01.996 --> 41:03.840
It's hepatitis C, isn't it?

41:06.682 --> 41:08.645
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

41:12.130 --> 41:16.375
So, um... it started,

41:16.496 --> 41:20.861
like, the second night
I was in the slot, right?

41:20.941 --> 41:23.746
And she came in and, um,

41:23.866 --> 41:25.867
I was sleeping and
she had a pillow over my face,

41:25.988 --> 41:27.910
like pushing down on it with
all her weight, you know?

41:27.991 --> 41:29.954
This room she took me to.

41:30.074 --> 41:33.158
I don't know where it was.
It was dark.

41:33.278 --> 41:36.883
She made me say things. You know,
like I was worthless and I was

41:36.963 --> 41:38.885
pointless and I was nothing.

41:39.005 --> 41:42.410
She made me scratch my arms until
they bled, and then she'd pour metho

41:42.530 --> 41:45.975
on them if she didn't
get the answer she wanted.

41:47.336 --> 41:50.300
And she made me...

41:58.153 --> 41:59.472
It's OK.

42:00.555 --> 42:02.957
And then after this, she'd be, like,

42:03.037 --> 42:06.041
so nice to me, like really nice.

42:08.605 --> 42:11.448
I just can't get her out of my head.

44:22.583 --> 44:25.507
Hey, Vera.
I know it's late, but I'm...

44:27.750 --> 44:30.553
Sometimes it's not
good to be alone.

44:31.555 --> 44:33.197
Come in.

44:35.960 --> 44:40.526
Oh, you've tidied up.
Yeah, tidy room, tidy mind.

44:40.606 --> 44:43.170
My old man used to say that.

44:43.290 --> 44:46.976
I had to keep my room spick and span
at all times, otherwise...

44:49.379 --> 44:51.982
Our parents would have got
on famously. Yeah.

44:58.950 --> 45:00.653
Fletch... Vera, there's
something I need to...

45:00.674 --> 45:04.158
I need to say.
OK, you...

45:06.561 --> 45:08.283
It's good you're here.

45:10.967 --> 45:13.211
I've realised something
about my accident.

45:13.330 --> 45:19.779
There was nothing accidental
about it. I did it to myself.

45:21.942 --> 45:23.584
Do you remember what happened?

45:23.704 --> 45:27.228
No, but it's the only
thing that makes any sense.

45:27.349 --> 45:30.834
All my life, Vera, I've suffered
from depression. All my life.

45:30.955 --> 45:34.077
And there was the post-traumatic
stress after East Timor.

45:34.198 --> 45:37.924
Years of dark thoughts
and suicidal thoughts.

45:39.045 --> 45:42.931
I lost my swipe card and a prisoner
used it. I was gonna lose my job.

45:42.951 --> 45:45.553
Everything and anyone that had
ever meant anything to me was going

45:45.566 --> 45:49.571
to be taken away. I would have
seen that van and gone, "Fuck it!"

45:51.274 --> 45:53.437
Hey, Vera, it's OK.

45:54.033 --> 45:56.196
I'm... I'm fine.

45:56.422 --> 45:59.907
Knowing what it is
helps and I know now.

46:03.005 --> 46:08.652
I know.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

46:09.854 --> 46:13.338
Hey, what... what's that
they say about the truth,

46:13.418 --> 46:14.699
you know?

46:14.820 --> 46:17.743
It sets you free, Vera.
It sets you free.

46:19.506 --> 46:20.738
No.

46:27.116 --> 46:29.119
No, it's a bastard.
