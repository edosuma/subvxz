00:38.863 --> 00:42.634
<i>This game is called Bedtime.</i>

00:43.702 --> 00:45.704
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

00:46.671 --> 00:48.040
<i>Relax.</i>

00:50.142 --> 00:51.743
<i>See a dog</i>

00:52.811 --> 00:55.580
<i>floating over your head.</i>

00:56.715 --> 00:59.251
<i>Make the dog blue.</i>

01:00.485 --> 01:02.821
<i>Now, make it green.</i>

01:04.323 --> 01:07.126
<i>Now, make it purple.</i>

01:09.261 --> 01:14.934
<i>Make the dog as big
as the universe.</i>

01:16.969 --> 01:22.741
<i>Now, make the dog
as tiny as a dot.</i>

01:23.641 --> 01:26.979
<i>Big as the universe.</i>

01:27.679 --> 01:30.316
<i>Tiny as a dot.</i>

01:30.915 --> 01:32.851
<i>Big as the universe,</i>

01:33.352 --> 01:35.121
<i>tiny as a dot.</i>

01:36.821 --> 01:38.590
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

01:39.158 --> 01:40.859
<i>Chase the dog.</i>

01:47.299 --> 01:49.301
Are you ready girls?

01:49.435 --> 01:50.602
Get that cannon ready.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.205
We're going to blow
this guy away.

02:03.315 --> 02:05.284
This was beautiful.

02:25.271 --> 02:26.638
You're a genius!

02:28.140 --> 02:30.042
Everything looks
beautiful, my love.

02:30.176 --> 02:33.145
But I couldn't have done it
without your support, my pet.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.147
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

02:37.550 --> 02:39.584
Go on. Get out,
get out, get out.

02:39.717 --> 02:41.153
On it, Mr. Wallendorf.

02:44.156 --> 02:46.624
- Want to play a game?
- No.

02:47.359 --> 02:48.294
Yes.

02:49.195 --> 02:50.229
I don't know.

02:50.728 --> 02:51.696
Well,

02:51.830 --> 02:53.566
that sounds like a nifty game,

02:54.400 --> 02:57.369
but I had something
else in mind.

02:58.404 --> 02:59.972
It's called Flip Flop.

03:01.474 --> 03:02.807
Put yourself

03:06.345 --> 03:07.712
in a field.

03:09.914 --> 03:12.351
See the sun setting.

03:12.784 --> 03:14.619
See rainbows,

03:15.287 --> 03:16.721
clouds.

03:17.189 --> 03:19.391
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

03:19.525 --> 03:20.725
I believe in God.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.061
Blessings.

03:22.727 --> 03:24.430
I love you, Mrs. Wallendorf.

03:24.563 --> 03:25.965
You're such a good person.

03:26.098 --> 03:27.665
Thank you for such
a satisfying life.

03:27.799 --> 03:29.368
You're a very good person.

03:31.570 --> 03:32.904
How do you feel?

03:33.472 --> 03:34.373
Wonderful.

03:35.074 --> 03:37.143
- So beautiful.
- Mm.

03:39.345 --> 03:41.313
I'm going to play
a different game.

03:43.115 --> 03:44.816
This here one is called

03:47.219 --> 03:48.287
Mumbo Jumbo.

04:06.905 --> 04:08.706
- This is like a movie.
- Cut.

06:26.245 --> 06:28.447
We can't win
by playing not to lose.

06:29.081 --> 06:30.482
Quick, let's all do
lots of angel powder.

06:30.616 --> 06:33.552
That'll turn on your automatic
success mechanism.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.058
Look at him.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.759
He's good for nothing.

06:41.660 --> 06:45.097
These ugly motherfuckers just
have big life insurance policies.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.700
They always have, like,
five babies that need it.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.469
We want
the red Wallendorf shoes,

06:50.602 --> 06:52.671
and his family wants the money
from his life insurance.

06:52.805 --> 06:56.542
We are as pure as the snow
on the roof of a convent.

06:57.509 --> 06:58.610
Pass me my bow.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.949
Look at him, Rebecca.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.851
You got to watch him die.

07:20.199 --> 07:22.334
Ooh, nice shot, Cynthia.

07:29.541 --> 07:32.511
All of you, let's find the GPS
tracking system and make it quick.

07:32.644 --> 07:35.247
If it's portable, I want to activate
it and leave it on this big body.

07:35.381 --> 07:40.285
Sorry not sorry.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.589
Go. Go!

07:46.258 --> 07:48.961
We've got one tracking system
only and it's attached.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.462
Okay, wait
before you destroy it,

07:50.596 --> 07:52.131
we got to be ready to put
the pedals to the metal

07:52.264 --> 07:53.399
the second that you fry it.

07:53.532 --> 07:54.566
Got it.

07:59.972 --> 08:00.905
What the f...

08:01.206 --> 08:02.708
- Is she okay?
- What the fuck!

08:02.841 --> 08:03.976
What the...

08:04.877 --> 08:05.978
Fuck!

08:06.712 --> 08:07.912
It's fucking instant ramen.

08:08.046 --> 08:09.047
It was supposed to be
Wallendorf shoes.

08:09.181 --> 08:10.716
How did this happen?

08:11.083 --> 08:13.519
Well, that's just
empty calories.

08:14.086 --> 08:16.321
Are we even the criminals
in this situation?

08:17.156 --> 08:18.090
What do we do now?

08:18.223 --> 08:19.425
- Just leave it?
- No.

08:19.691 --> 08:21.126
We have to get rid of it.

08:25.097 --> 08:27.633
- How's life?
- Gets better with every step.

08:34.506 --> 08:36.942
Sir, we've been doing
extensive marketing research

08:37.075 --> 08:39.878
and we think it's more than a
good time to expand our product

08:40.012 --> 08:43.382
beyond only manufacturing
red high-heeled women's shoes.

08:44.283 --> 08:48.887
Sir, your talents as an artist and
a designer are globally renowned.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.124
Everybody wants more from you
than just red shoes.

08:52.257 --> 08:57.429
You guys try the new garlic
chicken fries over at Annabelle's?

08:58.197 --> 08:59.331
Mm, mm, mm.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.834
That is the finest shit
I've had in years.

09:01.967 --> 09:04.970
To be honest, I haven't been
to Annabelle's in year, sir.

09:05.504 --> 09:06.638
Why not?

09:07.573 --> 09:09.408
What's wrong with Annabelle's?

09:11.543 --> 09:12.611
Oh,

09:13.612 --> 09:14.580
don't tell me.

09:15.447 --> 09:19.251
You two are just a couple
of bark eating little vegans.

09:20.219 --> 09:21.854
Nope, nope. That's a negative.

09:21.987 --> 09:23.222
Neither am I, sir.

09:23.655 --> 09:24.958
Well,

09:25.624 --> 09:28.627
either of you seen my daughter
in the last couple of days?

09:29.428 --> 09:30.329
No, sir.

09:30.462 --> 09:32.397
Should we, um,

09:33.765 --> 09:35.000
deploy the rangers?

09:35.133 --> 09:36.568
Where to?

09:37.603 --> 09:38.737
Your apartment?

09:39.538 --> 09:43.342
Sir, your daughter is
definitely not in my apartment.

09:44.109 --> 09:45.344
How do I know that?

09:46.011 --> 09:49.648
You said you were a hot-blooded
carnivore just a second ago.

09:50.082 --> 09:53.752
And I'm also
a happily married man.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.120
Well, who isn't?

09:55.754 --> 09:58.992
You know what? Just go get my
daughter and bring her back here.

09:59.124 --> 10:04.196
And then we talk about how my fashion
dominance skills are needing to improve.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.532
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

10:07.132 --> 10:10.068
And try the chicken fried steak
over at Annabelle's,

10:10.202 --> 10:12.204
and then we'll talk about
product development.

10:13.338 --> 10:14.773
Yeah, yeah.

10:15.374 --> 10:17.276
- Hey, cheers.
- Hey, cheers.

10:32.391 --> 10:37.296
So, you grew up in a restaurant
like this one?

10:38.830 --> 10:40.265
It was similar.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.834
My mom and dad
and my uncle ran it.

10:44.169 --> 10:45.904
Kind of like
your family business,

10:46.505 --> 10:48.840
except from mine was
just a cool restaurant.

10:49.841 --> 10:53.211
I was helping in the kitchen since
before I could reach the stove.

10:53.345 --> 10:56.381
That... sounds cool.

10:57.883 --> 11:01.620
Everything kind of sounds cool,
but it's really hard work.

11:01.753 --> 11:04.122
That's why I ended up
the way I am now.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.729
- I got no heat in the heart.
- Oh.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.436
If I cut you,

11:18.804 --> 11:20.205
would you feel it?

11:30.549 --> 11:32.784
Nobody likes me. Not even you.

11:34.186 --> 11:35.287
Yes.

11:36.355 --> 11:37.856
You didn't hear what I said,
did you?

11:38.757 --> 11:39.858
What?

11:40.525 --> 11:43.195
Are you even listening to me?
Do... Does anyone?

11:43.328 --> 11:45.197
What are you trying
to say to me right now?

11:46.398 --> 11:50.135
I said, nobody likes me,
and you said "yes".

11:52.904 --> 11:54.172
Of course I like you.

11:55.874 --> 11:57.275
- Why?
- Why not?

11:57.409 --> 11:59.211
Oh my God, mom,
it's Jennifer Wallendorf.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.379
I know sweetie but it's...

12:00.512 --> 12:02.614
it's rude to stare, so just...

12:02.748 --> 12:03.382
Hi.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.816
- Come on.
- Sorry.

12:05.684 --> 12:06.585
Okay.

12:07.020 --> 12:08.286
That was great. Alright.

12:10.023 --> 12:11.823
Fuck, I got spotted.

12:19.831 --> 12:21.500
- What's this?
- It's no big deal,

12:21.633 --> 12:23.201
it just makes you faster.

12:23.335 --> 12:24.770
What, like a superhero?

12:24.903 --> 12:26.471
Exactly like a superhero.

12:32.979 --> 12:34.379
Not wearing heels, are you?

12:40.786 --> 12:42.921
Can I clear away some
of these empty plates?

12:43.522 --> 12:44.890
Yeah, uh, yeah.

12:45.024 --> 12:47.659
We'll just have two pieces
of banana cream pie.

12:47.793 --> 12:49.327
À mode.

12:49.996 --> 12:51.263
À la mode.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.631
Of course.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.272
- You remember the route?
- Yeah.

13:01.273 --> 13:02.407
Now, you were right
about that pill.

13:02.541 --> 13:04.043
I feel like a race car.

13:04.676 --> 13:05.844
- What kind?
- I don't care.

13:06.645 --> 13:09.781
So are we going to do this or
just start talking really quickly?

13:09.915 --> 13:10.950
Let's go.

13:12.952 --> 13:14.087
Fuck you!

13:14.219 --> 13:16.155
Whoa. Hey, hey!

13:16.288 --> 13:19.224
- Go, go now.
- Get back here!

13:20.927 --> 13:22.195
Stop!

13:22.327 --> 13:23.595
Little fuckers!

13:25.430 --> 13:27.232
Get back here, goddammit!

13:28.400 --> 13:29.768
Go, go.

13:37.176 --> 13:38.310
Wallendorf!

13:40.947 --> 13:42.380
Wait!

13:47.019 --> 13:48.286
Oh, hey, don't kill him.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.654
Quiet, he's fat.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.556
Does fat mean
he deserves to be hurt?

13:51.823 --> 13:53.658
Obesity is the number one
killer in the country.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.594
Even if you combine war
and all disease.

13:56.062 --> 13:57.596
Keep my face out of the frame
with that thing.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.132
I'm not going
to frame your face.

14:00.499 --> 14:01.833
Don't kill him though.

14:01.968 --> 14:03.102
This guy is like a whale.

14:03.236 --> 14:04.736
He can take a bat
to the stomach.

14:11.543 --> 14:13.879
Oh fu... Oh my God.

14:23.189 --> 14:24.589
What... hey ya...

14:30.595 --> 14:32.898
Goodbye.

14:37.803 --> 14:38.737
Why...?

14:43.842 --> 14:45.677
Okay, roll down your window.

14:45.811 --> 14:50.183
Unbuckle your seat belt
right after we hit the water.

14:50.749 --> 14:52.084
Get ready to swim out.

14:53.052 --> 14:53.986
Okay.

14:55.988 --> 14:56.888
Ready.

15:33.226 --> 15:34.327
Is that hidden enough?

15:34.759 --> 15:36.095
- Yeah.
- Great.

15:36.695 --> 15:38.931
I mean, I would've wanted
it to go under more, but

15:39.198 --> 15:40.166
doesn't make a difference now.

15:41.666 --> 15:42.834
No one's going to find
it here anyway.

15:43.269 --> 15:45.304
Makes about as much
sense as anything else.

15:45.837 --> 15:47.405
We could firebomb that.

15:48.274 --> 15:49.641
Would draw attention. Okay.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.476
Let's go back to the house
and find the girls.

15:51.610 --> 15:52.510
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

16:13.199 --> 16:17.669
<i>Oh, hell.
Cane brought Jennifer. How cool is that?</i>

16:27.812 --> 16:30.249
- Hi, Stew.
- Hello, Jennifer Wallendorf.

16:30.383 --> 16:35.254
Knock it off.
Hey, can I get a pint of straight whiskey?

16:35.388 --> 16:36.454
Sure thing.

16:36.588 --> 16:38.157
It's quite a drink, little lady.

16:39.925 --> 16:42.228
Cane, Cane. Oh, beautiful Cane,
thank God you're here.

16:42.361 --> 16:44.397
It is complete anarchy
in the kitchen. I mean,

16:44.529 --> 16:46.399
we're just trying to make big pots
of the simple potato and beet soup,

16:46.531 --> 16:48.767
a little bit of veggies,
and these guys are just fucking it up

16:48.900 --> 16:50.169
in ways that I can't
even describe.

16:50.303 --> 16:52.038
Okay, man,
I'll come help out in a sec.

16:52.171 --> 16:53.838
- Let me just grab a quick drink.
- Thank you. You are a saint.

16:53.973 --> 16:55.408
I'm sorry. One second. What
the fuck are you doing?

16:55.540 --> 16:57.209
Hey Stew, I'll just have
a shot of that.

17:04.183 --> 17:05.684
Don't. What the fuck?
Look at this...

17:05.817 --> 17:06.953
Look at this.
Does that look good to you?

17:07.086 --> 17:08.553
It's fucking disgusting.
Do it again.

17:08.687 --> 17:10.222
Jennifer, take it easy
with that whiskey.

17:10.356 --> 17:11.723
I got to help in the kitchen.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.225
I am taking it easy.

17:14.393 --> 17:15.560
Go do your thing.

17:15.694 --> 17:18.931
Okay, okay,
relax, people. Relax.

17:19.731 --> 17:21.200
Everybody stay calm.

17:21.334 --> 17:22.701
...it goes in the peel,
you slice it...

17:22.834 --> 17:24.769
...so much, I swear to God.

17:26.705 --> 17:28.673
- Stew, can I get another?
- Of course, but

17:28.807 --> 17:32.311
I honestly think two pints of whiskey
is going to make you fall down again.

17:32.445 --> 17:35.114
Stew, can you just let me live?

17:51.931 --> 17:53.598
<i>Cut, you don't kill the flavors,
it's going to...</i>

17:53.732 --> 17:55.935
Alright, chicken broth,
people, chicken broth.

17:56.068 --> 17:57.902
Let's get some chicken broth.

18:18.290 --> 18:21.327
Hi, girls, what did
you get up to tonight?

18:23.329 --> 18:24.796
- Scanner?
- Pleasure.

18:27.933 --> 18:29.301
- Hmm.
- To be honest,

18:29.935 --> 18:31.636
it wasn't the best
evening so far.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.571
We... we... we've
been keeping busy.

18:33.705 --> 18:35.274
- What about you?
- Hmm.

18:36.442 --> 18:38.277
Cane took me out to dinner.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.678
- He can be such a doll.
- I know.

18:40.812 --> 18:42.348
Well, love's the devil.

18:42.481 --> 18:43.482
And so is Cane.

18:43.615 --> 18:44.916
Wants some angel powder?

18:45.051 --> 18:46.885
Oh yeah, put it
on the back of my hand.

19:00.032 --> 19:01.733
Look at her go.

19:04.303 --> 19:07.273
Jesus Christ.

19:12.511 --> 19:14.246
Wow, that wasn't necessary.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.613
What? Was she stuck

19:15.747 --> 19:17.483
in a dark elevator
as a child or something?

19:17.615 --> 19:21.120
Lean her against the wall,
so she doesn't choke in her own vomit.

19:22.221 --> 19:23.255
Cane!

19:25.157 --> 19:26.292
Oh, Cane?

19:27.460 --> 19:29.328
Can you come get
your girlfriend?

19:39.972 --> 19:41.673
I need a drink.

19:44.510 --> 19:45.910
Where are my clothes?

19:47.246 --> 19:48.347
Where is my purse?

19:50.082 --> 19:51.783
Well, you've got
my shoe at least.

19:52.485 --> 19:54.120
Well, your clothes
are right over there.

19:54.253 --> 19:56.522
- There's vomit on them.
- Oh.

19:57.056 --> 19:58.790
Okay.

19:59.191 --> 20:00.692
Oh, wow. No.

20:01.293 --> 20:03.095
Hey, come here.

20:04.029 --> 20:05.464
How did I get so sick?

20:05.897 --> 20:07.832
- You don't remember?
- Hmm, no.

20:09.001 --> 20:12.204
Well, you downed two
straight pints of whiskey

20:12.338 --> 20:13.738
and I tried to stop you.

20:13.872 --> 20:15.474
Then you went into Cynthia's
ladies only room

20:15.608 --> 20:18.377
and started snorting rails
and venting with the girls.

20:19.411 --> 20:20.645
Mmm...

20:24.816 --> 20:26.986
Why are you looking
at my shoe like that?

20:29.421 --> 20:32.291
Don't tell me, like, you're
just one of those guys who

20:32.924 --> 20:35.995
likes my dad's shoes
more than he likes me.

20:39.498 --> 20:40.566
It's not like that.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.768
I was checking out the shoe
and trying to figure things out.

20:44.370 --> 20:50.409
Okay. So did you figure things out while
staring at my shoe while I was passed out?

20:53.546 --> 20:55.680
Can you get me some champagne?

20:59.485 --> 21:02.454
I just don't understand all the
conspiracy theories about your family.

21:03.322 --> 21:06.225
Did you know there's a whole movement
where they believe your family are lizards?

21:06.358 --> 21:09.028
- Mm-hmm.
- And you guys are trying to make the world hotter

21:09.161 --> 21:10.963
because it's
your natural climate?

21:12.231 --> 21:14.899
It's backed up with
mathematicians, scientists,

21:15.034 --> 21:17.937
as well as former Wallendorf
shoes executives.

21:19.004 --> 21:21.140
Well, do you think that's true?

21:21.873 --> 21:23.908
I know you're not a lizard.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.778
What's up with the red shoes?

21:26.911 --> 21:28.113
Ugh...

21:31.916 --> 21:33.018
It's information.

21:33.452 --> 21:35.588
So, in order to get
the seven-year

21:35.720 --> 21:38.057
unlimited replacement warranty,

21:38.190 --> 21:39.824
you have to give
Wallendorf shoes access

21:39.959 --> 21:42.860
to all of your personal
information and everything else.

21:42.995 --> 21:45.531
Once my father has access to
someone's personal information,

21:45.664 --> 21:48.900
he can categorize their whole
life in less than a paragraph.

21:50.135 --> 21:51.637
How much you're willing
to spend on a sandwich

21:51.769 --> 21:53.871
or how much you're willing
to spend on a cup of coffee,

21:54.006 --> 21:55.407
and then he'll get
you to spend more

21:55.541 --> 21:56.642
or influence your behavior

21:56.774 --> 21:58.743
based off of your
personality type.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.349
That's just as crazy
as the lizard thing.

22:03.482 --> 22:05.184
Well, nobody wants
to believe that their life

22:05.317 --> 22:08.053
can become less than a syllable
in under a second.

22:09.754 --> 22:10.623
Madness.

22:10.755 --> 22:12.391
Ooh, yeah, definitely.

22:13.592 --> 22:15.561
Hey, there's no cameras
allowed in here.

22:15.694 --> 22:16.729
Yeah, I know.

22:17.329 --> 22:19.365
This is an antique
Polaroid camera.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.101
It's untraceable.

22:25.137 --> 22:29.108
You want me to take some
pictures of you with this thing?

22:29.774 --> 22:31.176
Hm, exactly.

22:32.844 --> 22:33.946
Alright.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.485
Ah, cool, you're not dead.

23:14.787 --> 23:16.121
I think I'm alive.

23:16.255 --> 23:19.058
Mostly because of this
feeling of terminal love.

23:19.458 --> 23:21.660
Well, did you ever
wake up feeling like

23:21.794 --> 23:23.729
you're looking out a window

23:23.861 --> 23:26.365
at a beautiful beach
with the wind in your hair?

23:27.032 --> 23:28.233
- Yeah.
- Well,

23:28.367 --> 23:29.968
Mitch thinks
we drank all of his beer

23:30.102 --> 23:31.270
and destroyed his motorcycle.

23:31.437 --> 23:32.638
He's been saying it
for over a week

23:32.771 --> 23:33.706
and won't back down,

23:33.838 --> 23:35.808
so now Cynthia has to fight him.

23:35.941 --> 23:37.443
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch!

23:37.576 --> 23:39.712
I am the king. King!

23:39.844 --> 23:42.715
That guy is huge.

23:42.847 --> 23:44.450
I am the crusher.

23:44.583 --> 23:46.785
This isn't your dad's tower,
princess.

23:46.918 --> 23:50.289
Someone's about to get hurt
because of living space and food.

23:50.422 --> 23:53.692
Nothing around here is just
about beer or motorcycles.

23:54.226 --> 23:55.694
- Uhh...
- Clean as usual.

23:55.828 --> 23:58.797
- How's the champagne?
- Cool. It's pretty clean, too.

23:59.231 --> 24:02.434
- Okay, you guys want to grab some breakfast real quick?
- Yeah, go get some food.

24:02.568 --> 24:04.869
I will just make some
breakfast burritos real quick.

24:05.003 --> 24:06.071
Be right back.

24:06.772 --> 24:08.374
- Nice shoes.
- Yeah?

24:08.841 --> 24:10.275
Are... are you patronizing me?

24:10.409 --> 24:12.444
Do rich people eat breakfast?

24:12.578 --> 24:14.879
Or are you guys living
off of champagne,

24:15.013 --> 24:17.516
- nice shoes and jewelry?
- Yeah.

24:18.016 --> 24:19.884
We just survive
off of champagne,

24:20.018 --> 24:21.720
and then we name
fancy shoes after ourselves.

24:21.854 --> 24:22.887
How does that not make sense?

24:23.021 --> 24:24.123
- Huh?
- Oh, okay.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.824
Well, Jennifer.

24:25.958 --> 24:28.160
Can you just
get yourself together?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.295
Why don't you just go marry
prince charming, little mermaid.

24:30.429 --> 24:32.664
You just... look at me,
look at me.

24:32.798 --> 24:35.667
Girls, kind of... this...
I'm going to talk.

24:35.801 --> 24:37.603
So, here's the thing,

24:37.736 --> 24:40.806
I've already taken
a private jet to the Bahamas

24:40.939 --> 24:42.174
and pretty much everywhere else.

24:42.307 --> 24:44.543
I've met, like,
ten Prince Charming's,

24:44.676 --> 24:46.512
and they weren't
the least bit charming.

24:46.979 --> 24:50.549
Half of them were not even
real princes. So bleh.

24:51.483 --> 24:54.787
Why can't you just accept that,
like, maybe I am just as lost

24:54.919 --> 24:59.291
if not, maybe a little... little
bit more lost than all you.

24:59.425 --> 25:02.361
Fine. But can I just give you
some friendly advice

25:02.494 --> 25:04.696
about chef boy Cane over there?

25:05.564 --> 25:06.465
Yeah.

25:07.466 --> 25:09.368
Don't get too attached,
sweetheart.

25:10.068 --> 25:11.904
Thinking you can
hold on to Cane is like

25:12.037 --> 25:14.273
thinking you can grab smoke.

25:15.374 --> 25:18.110
Cynthia. Come on, Cynthia.

25:18.243 --> 25:21.346
- Here you go, ladies. Fresh breakfast burritos.
- It's okay,

25:21.480 --> 25:23.382
just sit there
and eat your breakfast

25:23.515 --> 25:25.984
while I'm up here, ready to go.

25:26.118 --> 25:27.386
- I don't eat food.
- It's...

25:27.519 --> 25:28.720
- it's a private jet, just...
- I don't...

25:28.854 --> 25:30.556
you don't eat private jets.

25:33.392 --> 25:34.393
[exhales

25:34.526 --> 25:37.596
Yeah. Get it on. Get it on.

25:45.370 --> 25:46.505
And fight.

25:46.638 --> 25:48.774
- Get him!
- Cynthia!

25:48.907 --> 25:51.643
You squirmy little worm,
I will crush you flat.

25:53.679 --> 25:55.013
Get him!

25:56.215 --> 25:58.750
Get here, girl,
I'm gonna do you dirty.

25:59.151 --> 26:00.452
Get here. Oh, yeah.

26:00.586 --> 26:02.087
Oh, goddamn!

26:03.155 --> 26:06.191
Gonna rip your legs off, bitch!

26:07.226 --> 26:10.829
- Cynthia, yeah!
- Come on, come on, let's go, Cynthia!

26:11.230 --> 26:14.466
Fire, prison, faster.

26:16.034 --> 26:17.436
Come to papa.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.008
I'm going to put
a stick on your thighs.

26:23.141 --> 26:24.276
Gonna be dirty!

26:25.143 --> 26:27.746
Help, help!

26:29.815 --> 26:31.083
I'll kill you!

26:31.583 --> 26:34.286
I'm gonna crush you
fucking flat.

26:36.622 --> 26:40.926
Cynthia! Cynthia!

26:41.059 --> 26:41.928
Come on!

26:44.931 --> 26:45.932
You got no good.

26:46.365 --> 26:47.533
I'm gonna crush you!

26:49.134 --> 26:53.038
It's okay, Cynthia, you can do it.
Get up. Come on, let's go!

26:55.240 --> 26:57.509
- Yes!
- Steal his breath.

27:00.913 --> 27:01.880
Stop.

27:02.481 --> 27:04.650
I give up. I was only joking.

27:05.018 --> 27:05.918
I was getting...

27:17.563 --> 27:21.333
Cynthia, come here, come on, you're
okay, you're okay. Come... come on.

27:21.466 --> 27:22.901
Am I... am I alive?

27:23.036 --> 27:24.436
- We got you.
- Where's Mitch?

27:24.570 --> 27:26.505
- We won. The fights over.
- You did it.

27:26.638 --> 27:28.106
I can't remember
the fight in my brain.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.174
I think you're better off.

27:29.308 --> 27:30.542
- It's okay.
- What?

27:30.676 --> 27:32.210
- I think he's choking.
- Mitch is dead.

27:32.344 --> 27:34.713
- Get it off. Get off.
- You killed that big guy.

27:35.647 --> 27:37.382
They're not getting
this now, girl.

27:37.516 --> 27:38.584
Come on, Mitch, get up.

27:38.717 --> 27:40.218
- Come on, Mitch.
- Mitch, get up.

28:08.081 --> 28:09.949
Chad, there's rumors
of you spending nights and days

28:10.083 --> 28:12.618
in Mrs. Wallendorf room
with her and her maids.

28:19.758 --> 28:22.394
- Mrs. Wallendorf and her maids, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

28:24.329 --> 28:26.565
Don't go spreading rumors
like that about me.

28:26.698 --> 28:28.767
You know, I'm loyal
to the Wallendorf family.

28:28.900 --> 28:29.901
I only do...

28:32.071 --> 28:33.572
what is asked.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.374
I know, it's not me.

28:36.009 --> 28:39.244
Rumors about you and Mrs.
Wallendorf are being spread on their own.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.116
I thought you were my friend.

28:43.715 --> 28:45.617
Rumors don't get
spread on their own.

28:46.284 --> 28:47.719
Somebody spreads it.

28:48.420 --> 28:49.721
I am your friend.

28:50.589 --> 28:53.158
That's why I'm telling you
what everyone's talking about.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.795
I don't want you to wind up being a lead
of one of Mr. Wallendorf commercials

28:56.929 --> 29:01.233
because you have a problem
with self-control or something.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.403
If you need to talk about it,
I'm here.

29:08.340 --> 29:10.876
I'm not very chatty.

29:12.277 --> 29:13.912
And everyone's lying.

29:17.482 --> 29:19.651
Where's your precious truck?

29:19.952 --> 29:21.154
I'm so sorry.

29:21.286 --> 29:22.654
It's all my fault.

29:23.588 --> 29:24.756
I'm going to find it soon.

29:25.223 --> 29:28.694
But your plan was flawless,
and you believe in God.

29:29.261 --> 29:30.862
Who would steal ramen?

29:31.296 --> 29:33.966
There's no way anybody could
have known there was gold inside.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.867
Ramen has the least spiritual,

29:36.002 --> 29:39.838
monetary or sentimental value
of anything you can think of.

29:40.205 --> 29:41.540
I dropped the ball.

29:42.175 --> 29:43.976
I'm too busy for my pants.

29:44.676 --> 29:48.114
So $1.6 billion dollars
worth of gold was untraceable.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.248
It was completely my fault.

29:50.382 --> 29:52.484
Someone inside the palace knows.

29:53.485 --> 29:55.454
Must be an inside conspiracy.

29:55.955 --> 29:57.389
You have to kill.

29:57.522 --> 29:59.025
You have to torture
the senior staff,

29:59.158 --> 30:00.193
it's your only option.

30:00.325 --> 30:01.393
Ah...

30:02.095 --> 30:03.662
There are always traitors.

30:05.031 --> 30:06.231
That's the golden rule.

30:06.364 --> 30:07.566
I'll kill.

30:08.366 --> 30:09.735
I'll kill the staff.

30:10.602 --> 30:11.870
Oh, they all believe in God.

30:12.304 --> 30:15.407
They'll be blessed to leave
this world by my merciful hands.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.476
Find out who
the conspirators are.

30:18.010 --> 30:21.480
There's always lies and murder
when gold is on the line.

30:21.948 --> 30:23.515
And always remember,

30:24.282 --> 30:27.120
"Murder is plan A."

30:43.502 --> 30:48.373
<i>So you grew up in
a restaurant like this one?</i>

30:48.507 --> 30:51.576
<i>I was helping in the kitchen
since before I could reach the stove.</i>

30:51.710 --> 30:53.345
I remember standing on a stool.

30:54.479 --> 30:55.781
Anyway, my whole family
got murdered,

30:55.914 --> 30:57.415
and the restaurant
was burned down.

30:57.549 --> 31:00.485
So, here's your happy ending.

31:03.990 --> 31:05.791
Wait, are you serious
about that?

31:06.225 --> 31:07.093
Yeah.

31:11.396 --> 31:13.032
- Chad?
- Hmm?

31:13.166 --> 31:14.934
You've seen my daughter lately?

31:16.235 --> 31:17.136
Nope.

31:17.669 --> 31:19.038
Neither have I.

31:19.471 --> 31:21.174
I suppose that makes
fucking three of us.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.943
Get the rangers
looking for her, huh?

31:24.442 --> 31:27.579
- Of course.
- I don't understand why we can't find her

31:28.181 --> 31:31.583
with all the satellites and
the digital tracking machines.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.087
She's constantly posting where
she is and what she's doing.

31:35.221 --> 31:36.956
And I don't like it!

31:38.057 --> 31:39.225
It's a disgrace.

31:39.357 --> 31:40.759
She does things, like,

31:40.892 --> 31:43.361
sets up devices
in different parts of the town.

31:43.495 --> 31:46.364
It's as if she wants everyone to
know that she's somewhere else.

31:46.731 --> 31:49.035
Sometimes we have rangers
deployed all over the city

31:49.168 --> 31:51.603
and then your cook or
one of your maids finds her here

31:51.736 --> 31:54.339
eating cereal or sleeping
in her room, you know?

31:55.640 --> 31:57.243
- It's great.
- It's stupid.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.910
It is, it is.

31:59.045 --> 32:00.378
Just get her.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.049
Bring her back to me.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.083
Yes, sir.

32:09.288 --> 32:10.422
Chad?

32:10.957 --> 32:12.124
You got a point?

32:12.258 --> 32:14.026
Or you just going to stare at me

32:14.160 --> 32:16.828
like some weird
hungry vulture all night.

32:16.963 --> 32:20.365
Sir, we believe
it's time to expand.

32:21.033 --> 32:26.339
Beyond just the simple manufacturing
of women's red high-heeled shoes.

32:26.939 --> 32:28.874
- Them here shoes?
- Right?

32:31.210 --> 32:32.444
These here shoes?

32:33.678 --> 32:37.515
These shoes are
overwhelming the planet.

32:38.217 --> 32:41.153
Ain't nothing simple about
a pair of woman's shoes.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.541
Are you okay, Jennifer?

33:03.675 --> 33:05.244
Your father's been
looking for you.

33:05.378 --> 33:07.579
Who asked you, doll face?

33:08.914 --> 33:09.949
Okay.

33:12.018 --> 33:14.387
- Here, let me help you.
- Batch, ba...

33:15.021 --> 33:17.123
I strongly suggest you keep
your hands to yourself

33:17.256 --> 33:21.060
unless you want to be the star
of my first murder mystery.

33:25.264 --> 33:28.000
- I've got too many pots on my fire.
- Hey, hey, hey.

33:28.533 --> 33:30.869
It's not all your fault,
Mrs. Wallendorf.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.172
And I'm gonna find everything.

33:33.538 --> 33:35.540
Trust.

33:37.609 --> 33:39.778
Jennifer, Jennifer.

33:40.379 --> 33:42.214
Where have you been?

33:43.682 --> 33:45.517
Oh my God, sweetheart.

33:46.352 --> 33:47.420
You're drunk.

33:47.919 --> 33:50.455
Your hair is green,
and you're covered in vomit.

33:50.588 --> 33:53.225
It's a wig, Mom.

33:55.094 --> 33:57.896
But I'm gay,
and I'm leaving the church.

34:15.448 --> 34:19.185
Your depression is only
due to negative thoughts.

34:19.718 --> 34:24.023
If you just breathe
and stay loving God

34:24.522 --> 34:26.691
and only have positive thoughts,

34:26.825 --> 34:29.894
the whole world will
change around you.

34:32.564 --> 34:33.798
I hate you.

34:34.799 --> 34:36.501
Please get out of my life.

34:38.636 --> 34:40.638
The heart of a mother
is a deep abyss,

34:41.840 --> 34:43.541
at the bottom of which

34:44.642 --> 34:46.078
always find forgiveness.

35:17.043 --> 35:18.643
[Mrs. Wallendorf <i>All of
the information was coded</i>

35:18.777 --> 35:20.812
<i>and sent
through private satellites.</i>

35:21.113 --> 35:23.115
<i>You can't depend
on technical error.</i>

35:23.681 --> 35:25.317
<i>There are always traitors.</i>

35:26.118 --> 35:28.220
<i>You should murder this one.</i>

35:28.887 --> 35:30.990
<i>If the conspirators
start to disappear,</i>

35:31.123 --> 35:32.958
it will send a clear message
to the others,

35:33.092 --> 35:34.726
and they'll start to talk.

35:35.860 --> 35:38.130
Make them talk or die.

35:40.099 --> 35:43.035
Either way, it's the best
thing for everyone.

35:44.136 --> 35:45.804
Where's my ramen noodle soup?

35:46.905 --> 35:48.807
I know that you know
where it is.

35:50.042 --> 35:51.843
You have my ramen noodle
soup truck, don't you?

35:51.977 --> 35:54.313
Mrs. Wallendorf, I don't know
anything about your ramen noodle soup.

35:54.447 --> 35:56.282
- Don't you?
- What are you talking about?

35:56.415 --> 35:58.951
Why... why... why do you care
about ramen noodle soup?

35:59.085 --> 36:02.587
But... you're a... you're...
you're a good person.

36:03.155 --> 36:04.856
Let me go now and...
and I will get you

36:04.990 --> 36:06.891
the best ramen noodle soup
in the whole world.

36:07.026 --> 36:09.861
Do you know how much
it will hurt

36:09.995 --> 36:12.498
- to be shot in the cranium with a derringer?
- Oh, God.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.700
The bullet will just rattle
around inside your skull.

36:16.102 --> 36:18.404
It won't kill you right away.
No, it will just leave you there

36:18.537 --> 36:20.439
with your brains shuffled
like a deck of cards

36:20.573 --> 36:24.043
and stirred up like oatmeal.

36:24.909 --> 36:27.146
Then you'll just choke
on your own blood.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.014
Or maybe dehydrate.

36:29.548 --> 36:32.218
Do you know that it
could take over 24 hours

36:32.351 --> 36:36.621
for your spirit to leave this
meaningless meat that is your body?

36:37.289 --> 36:40.359
Mrs.
Wallendorf, please don't shoot me.

36:40.493 --> 36:42.161
This is crazy, over ramen?

36:42.694 --> 36:45.864
I'll fly to Japan and... and
I'll... I'll... I'll get you the...

36:45.998 --> 36:48.567
the most authentic ramen
from the finest chef in Tokyo.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.269
Just let me go.

36:50.702 --> 36:52.538
You... you're such a good person,

36:52.972 --> 36:55.207
you're... you're such
a good person.

36:56.208 --> 36:58.344
A violent death over ramen?

36:58.910 --> 37:01.113
This is... This is unnecessary.

37:01.913 --> 37:03.616
This is necessary.

37:04.049 --> 37:05.417
This is necessary.

37:06.252 --> 37:08.621
If you know anything about
history or religious scripture,

37:08.753 --> 37:12.291
you would know that violence is
the most natural cause of death.

37:13.658 --> 37:15.194
And since your death
is imminent,

37:16.362 --> 37:17.563
I can say

37:18.430 --> 37:22.901
we both know
this isn't about ramen.

37:23.902 --> 37:26.272
- It's about gold.
- What?

37:26.838 --> 37:28.440
What the hell
is she talking about?

37:28.574 --> 37:30.342
<i>So a violent death over gold...</i>

37:30.476 --> 37:32.378
Ramen is gold?

37:32.978 --> 37:34.947
Well, that's not only natural,

37:35.914 --> 37:37.715
it's necessary.

37:42.887 --> 37:44.190
Can you talk?

37:47.825 --> 37:51.997
You want me to put some mellow jazz on and
dance around naked for you while you die?

37:53.898 --> 37:55.367
I'm happy to.

38:29.901 --> 38:30.936
What?

38:31.303 --> 38:32.870
What you're doing, pumpkin?

38:33.239 --> 38:35.807
Told you not to come in here
with the door closed.

38:36.408 --> 38:38.876
I told you not to call me
pumpkin anymore either.

38:39.011 --> 38:41.913
Well, I... I didn't come in.
I'm just knocking.

38:42.648 --> 38:44.882
Fine, whatever.
Come in. I don't care.

38:48.587 --> 38:49.588
Holy shit.

38:50.222 --> 38:52.658
Why do you insist
on having the entire world

38:52.790 --> 38:54.093
see you in your underwear?

38:55.760 --> 38:57.229
Is that necessary?

38:57.997 --> 39:00.399
Holy shit!
Some of it's even nude.

39:01.833 --> 39:03.202
You know, this is crazy.

39:03.335 --> 39:04.336
Crazy!

39:04.836 --> 39:06.505
You could be inviting stalkers,

39:06.639 --> 39:09.508
kidnappers, creepy cyber daters.

39:09.642 --> 39:11.243
I learned this from you.

39:11.843 --> 39:14.013
This is what you do
with your models.

39:14.146 --> 39:16.649
I'm just so much better at it.

39:17.416 --> 39:20.185
I'm your most famous model
by ten hundred times.

39:20.319 --> 39:22.187
I mean, without me,
sales would drop.

39:22.988 --> 39:26.525
God, you think
everything is about you.

39:26.992 --> 39:28.294
My fans love me.

39:29.161 --> 39:32.231
You know, all the social media
is not really love.

39:32.731 --> 39:35.534
And what are you doing with
rainbow-colored cheerios in your hair?

39:35.668 --> 39:39.204
Is that some new "I'm the most
popular model in the world" look?

39:39.672 --> 39:40.606
Yes.

39:40.739 --> 39:42.141
And if you don't get it,

39:42.541 --> 39:43.808
you just don't get it.

39:43.942 --> 39:44.943
Oh, I get it.

39:45.077 --> 39:47.046
No, you don't get it, Dad.

39:47.179 --> 39:48.846
You don't get it at all.

39:49.281 --> 39:52.884
Well, why don't you just explain
it to me then, pumpkin?

39:54.119 --> 39:56.255
I'm talking about something that
you don't get or understand,

39:56.388 --> 39:57.723
that's why I can't
explain it to you.

39:57.855 --> 39:59.325
And stop calling me pumpkin.

40:00.192 --> 40:02.695
My so-called renegade marketing
is just as important

40:02.827 --> 40:06.265
as all the videos that you bombard people
with through your private satellite.

40:06.398 --> 40:08.067
Can we take this
conversation downstairs?

40:08.567 --> 40:11.804
Your mama had Becky in the
kitchen make amazing ramen

40:11.937 --> 40:13.739
and it's topped
with white truffles,

40:13.871 --> 40:15.274
gold leaf.

40:15.774 --> 40:18.344
You had Becky in the kitchen
gold leaf your ramen noodle soup?

40:18.477 --> 40:20.579
I mean, you know how
your mother is about food.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.282
And look who's talking,

40:23.682 --> 40:25.250
you got cereal in your hair.

40:26.018 --> 40:27.353
What's that all about?

40:27.486 --> 40:28.520
Whatever.

40:29.955 --> 40:31.023
That ramen sounds crazy though,

40:31.156 --> 40:32.691
I'm going to take
a picture of it.

40:33.058 --> 40:37.129
And then I'm going to post it.

40:42.334 --> 40:43.535
Pumpkin.

41:01.487 --> 41:03.088
I can't stand those
bodybuilder guys.

41:03.222 --> 41:04.790
We've already been through this.

41:05.557 --> 41:08.926
Look, a locker in the gym is the
safest place to keep our computer.

41:09.328 --> 41:11.063
Maybe it was the cheapest place.

41:11.797 --> 41:14.666
You don't have to work out with those
people just to make it look casual.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.470
It's like steroid cops asking me if I wanna
get a protein shake with a long shower.

41:18.604 --> 41:21.440
Well, your girlfriend probably
appreciates that you're fit.

41:21.874 --> 41:23.075
Let's just get to work.

41:25.210 --> 41:29.248
Well, it looks like there's a truckload of
flat screen TVs coming into town tonight.

41:29.381 --> 41:31.049
Are you sure they're
flat screen TVs?

41:31.583 --> 41:33.819
I don't know how that ramen
noodle soup mix-up happened.

41:34.286 --> 41:37.823
I honestly think there could have been
some other criminals involved or something.

41:37.956 --> 41:39.324
Or maybe a computer glitch.

41:39.458 --> 41:41.460
I don't want to hit
Wallendorf shipping again.

41:41.593 --> 41:42.628
Okay, not right now.

41:42.995 --> 41:44.163
I'm not stupid.

41:44.296 --> 41:45.330
I'm not gonna put
you and your bandits

41:45.464 --> 41:46.932
in more danger than I have to.

41:47.366 --> 41:50.002
This is CBA freight systems
and flat screen TVs.

41:50.135 --> 41:52.204
Look at it, it's right here.

41:53.138 --> 41:54.440
Sounds good.

41:54.873 --> 41:55.974
The CBA always has those

41:56.375 --> 41:57.743
geo-fences
around their trucks.

41:57.876 --> 41:59.311
I can just fry the whole system.

41:59.445 --> 42:00.813
We're actually running
really low on food

42:00.946 --> 42:03.015
and even basic ingredients
to make bread, so...

42:03.148 --> 42:09.154
I know. Us... bandits are
hitting a supermarket for groceries.

42:09.588 --> 42:11.690
- Great.
- And you and your finaglers.

42:11.824 --> 42:13.959
can figure out how to safely
sell the electronics.

42:14.092 --> 42:15.494
And get whatever else we need.

42:16.094 --> 42:19.698
And then I am off for a while.

42:20.132 --> 42:21.433
- That works.
- Ok.

42:21.567 --> 42:24.636
Well, stare deeply
into the computer screen,

42:25.270 --> 42:27.506
you got the ETA to memorize
and a location.

42:28.907 --> 42:30.008
Got it.

42:39.818 --> 42:41.253
<i>Close your eyes, pumpkin.</i>

42:44.823 --> 42:46.358
<i>You want to play a game?</i>

42:46.758 --> 42:47.659
Yes.

42:57.002 --> 43:00.172
<i>This game is called pumpkin.</i>

43:01.173 --> 43:02.841
<i>Pumpkin.</i>

43:08.780 --> 43:10.782
<i>Pumpkin.</i>

43:54.359 --> 43:56.194
Can I get you
something to drink?

43:56.930 --> 43:59.999
Yeah. Can I, uh, have a mimosa?

44:00.132 --> 44:01.600
Just a mimosa?

44:02.134 --> 44:02.936
That'll be all.

44:03.068 --> 44:04.236
Sure.

44:09.074 --> 44:10.208
Thank you, Nathan.

44:10.342 --> 44:12.377
I'm not Nathan.

44:13.645 --> 44:14.846
Sorry, I..., uh...

44:15.547 --> 44:17.182
I fell asleep last night
with the fan

44:17.316 --> 44:19.018
aimed directly at my head.

44:19.151 --> 44:22.554
Today everything looks and
sounds like I'm underwater.

44:24.923 --> 44:27.192
Must have thought
you were someone else.

44:44.843 --> 44:48.413
<i>Well, she does things,
like, have, um, three devices</i>

44:48.547 --> 44:50.049
<i>in different places around town,</i>

44:50.215 --> 44:51.583
<i>and she sets them up to activate</i>

44:51.717 --> 44:54.152
<i>and start posting things
at different times.</i>

44:56.421 --> 44:57.923
<i>It's as if she wants
everyone to know</i>

44:58.057 --> 45:00.026
<i>that she's somewhere else.
Somewhere else.</i>

45:00.158 --> 45:02.160
<i>Somewhere else. Somewhere else.</i>

45:11.803 --> 45:14.139
- Would you like another?
- I'm fine, Nathan.

45:15.975 --> 45:17.442
Didn't your mother ever tell
you not to sleep with the fan

45:17.576 --> 45:18.810
pointing straight at your head?

45:18.945 --> 45:20.212
You'd be lucky if
you don't catch the flu

45:20.345 --> 45:21.246
or something.

45:21.380 --> 45:22.748
Oh, Nathan.

45:24.050 --> 45:25.183
Fuck you.

45:38.730 --> 45:44.037
Would you wear these two
bracelets around your wrist,

45:44.169 --> 45:48.807
drive around the block for about an
hour and then come back and get me?

45:48.941 --> 45:50.709
Yes, ma'am. Happy to.

45:50.842 --> 45:51.810
Thank you.

46:11.263 --> 46:12.297
What are you wearing?

46:13.099 --> 46:14.566
Look who's talking,
you're in a costume.

46:14.700 --> 46:17.170
Uh, this isn't a costume.
It's a disguise.

46:17.302 --> 46:18.470
What is the difference?

46:18.603 --> 46:22.240
A costume, you wear for fun.

46:22.774 --> 46:25.844
A disguise, you wear
for deception.

46:25.978 --> 46:29.881
Coincidentally, I have
costumes in this suitcase.

46:30.016 --> 46:31.017
What are the costumes for?

46:31.150 --> 46:33.485
Your masquerade ball.

46:35.988 --> 46:38.590
What did you think
they were for?

46:39.992 --> 46:42.461
Are you inviting me to the
Wallendorf palace freak out thing

46:42.594 --> 46:44.262
- that everyone talks about?
- I'm not inviting you.

46:44.396 --> 46:45.731
I'm taking you.

46:51.436 --> 46:53.005
Can you hand me those
bracelets back?

46:53.438 --> 46:55.240
Of course, Miss Wallendorf.

46:59.845 --> 47:00.779
What's this?

47:00.912 --> 47:02.280
Tracking device.

47:03.983 --> 47:06.384
- You have to wear it?
- Yes.

47:10.589 --> 47:11.958
Is this dangerous?

47:14.026 --> 47:15.360
Well, you can't have
an adventure

47:15.494 --> 47:16.963
without an element of danger.

47:17.796 --> 47:21.833
Besides, you seem to be the type who veers
more towards the dangerous side of things.

47:21.968 --> 47:23.301
So...

47:24.170 --> 47:25.837
Will you stop being so dramatic?

47:25.972 --> 47:28.673
We're just sneaking into a party
at my parent's house.

47:29.208 --> 47:30.243
I find it...

47:30.977 --> 47:34.379
unlikely that they'd kill you,
even if they caught us.

47:43.156 --> 47:45.891
Can you wait for us?
We should just be a couple of hours.

47:46.025 --> 47:47.292
Yes, of course.

47:54.133 --> 47:56.969
- <i>Love the Wallendorf parties.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

47:57.103 --> 47:58.336
Bracelets?

48:02.374 --> 48:03.943
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

48:04.876 --> 48:06.812
<i>That keeps our spirits up.</i>

48:19.391 --> 48:22.094
- Holy, this place is crazy.
- Is it?

48:29.068 --> 48:30.102
I'm so hungover.

48:30.635 --> 48:32.071
My brain is swollen.

48:32.604 --> 48:34.040
Mine is too.

48:39.678 --> 48:42.614
<i>♪ Every curve was
a roller coaster ride ♪</i>

48:42.747 --> 48:46.418
<i>♪ That took me right there
to the hell she had inside ♪</i>

48:46.551 --> 48:48.020
<i>♪ She was fire ♪</i>

48:51.324 --> 48:52.657
Two whiskeys straight up.

49:03.735 --> 49:04.937
Another round, please.

49:13.678 --> 49:17.216
I love it when alcohol makes me go
from completely miserable and paranoid

49:17.350 --> 49:19.818
to being forking confident
in under five seconds.

49:19.952 --> 49:20.819
Me too.

49:21.220 --> 49:23.022
- Give me your bracelet.
- Don't I need these?

49:23.655 --> 49:25.624
My dad's tracking us
while we're wearing them.

49:26.259 --> 49:29.561
So just give it to me, and we'll
make him think we're somewhere else.

49:29.996 --> 49:33.032
I mean, he already knows I'm at
the bar with some guests anyway.

49:37.602 --> 49:39.138
What do we have there?

49:39.272 --> 49:41.107
Here we have some tuna
carpaccio for starters

49:41.240 --> 49:44.043
and on the other side
we have quiche puffs.

49:44.476 --> 49:46.912
I love quiche puffs.

49:49.048 --> 49:52.018
There. That ought to buy us
a few hours.

49:54.486 --> 49:55.587
Let's go.

50:04.696 --> 50:06.098
Chocolate!

50:31.790 --> 50:35.294
This is my dad's studio.

50:35.995 --> 50:38.364
This is where he shoots
all of his commercials

50:38.496 --> 50:42.701
and promotional photography
and everything, really.

50:43.369 --> 50:44.370
Whoa!

50:45.371 --> 50:47.572
You mean all that crazy
stuff in the commercials

50:47.706 --> 50:48.840
with landscapes and

50:49.208 --> 50:51.077
out on yachts
and giant ballrooms

50:51.210 --> 50:52.211
really happens here?

50:52.544 --> 50:53.980
That's what I just said.

50:54.479 --> 50:57.249
- Can't he see us? Aren't there cameras everywhere?
- No.

50:57.383 --> 51:00.652
He relies way more on tracking
systems than he does on cameras.

51:01.287 --> 51:02.821
He can track people's
cell phones

51:02.955 --> 51:04.556
and credit card chips

51:04.689 --> 51:06.125
and other stuff like that.

51:06.258 --> 51:07.826
Uh, he can even hear
what you're saying

51:07.960 --> 51:09.728
if you're in the same room
as your cell phone.

51:09.861 --> 51:12.198
And you can see through any
camera that's attached to a device

51:12.331 --> 51:13.531
with internet capabilities.

51:13.966 --> 51:15.800
Why on earth would he want
to do all that anyway?

51:15.935 --> 51:17.136
Well, he takes
the conversations

51:17.269 --> 51:18.603
and people's
personal information,

51:18.737 --> 51:20.006
stores it in
his super computers,

51:20.139 --> 51:21.906
and then computers
and the tech teams

51:22.041 --> 51:23.675
figure out what people are
talking about.

51:23.808 --> 51:25.877
And then they sell
that information off

51:26.012 --> 51:28.813
to massive corporations
and to government agencies,

51:28.948 --> 51:32.851
and then they easily influence people to
talk and think about whatever they want.

51:33.651 --> 51:34.686
Why?

51:34.819 --> 51:36.821
Money, religion,

51:37.756 --> 51:38.890
world domination.

51:39.425 --> 51:40.592
Well, that's scary.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.795
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Yeah, most people don't.

51:43.929 --> 51:45.297
That's why it works so well.

51:46.298 --> 51:48.434
- You went back to Annabelle's?
- Yeah.

51:49.235 --> 51:52.238
I can't even go there any more
without a disguise, thanks to you.

51:53.039 --> 51:54.173
Hush.

51:58.210 --> 52:00.678
Thank you, Mr. Wallendorf.
It's been our lifelong dream

52:00.812 --> 52:02.281
- to model for you.
- Oh.

52:02.747 --> 52:04.950
I'm... I'm not saying we're not
doing this just because it's cool,

52:05.084 --> 52:06.751
but everyone you put
in your commercials

52:06.885 --> 52:09.455
gets a hundred thousand
super fans, sponsors,

52:09.587 --> 52:12.891
and, we're just trying
to express our gratitude, sir.

52:13.259 --> 52:15.794
Pleasure is all mine, son,
the pleasure is all mine.

52:15.995 --> 52:17.729
Uh, now, what I'd like
you to do is...

52:18.164 --> 52:20.865
I'd like you to all get in front
of that green screen there

52:21.000 --> 52:23.835
and, uh, make yourself a nice
little circle, alright?

52:23.969 --> 52:25.037
Now, I want you all to...

52:25.171 --> 52:26.571
What's happening?

52:26.704 --> 52:28.240
Close your eyes.

52:30.675 --> 52:32.844
Close your eyes.

52:34.579 --> 52:38.951
Now, this game is called Snafu.

52:40.119 --> 52:42.154
- I think you...
- Don't talk.

52:42.288 --> 52:44.689
- Don't even breathe.
- Thought it'd be a little hard...

52:44.823 --> 52:46.791
Otherwise, my dad will kill you.

52:46.925 --> 52:48.660
...to get along
without his head.

52:48.793 --> 52:51.330
That's what I was trying to say
before you brought me here, princess.

52:51.464 --> 52:55.101
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna take down all your parts

52:55.234 --> 52:57.269
and then put them all
back together again.

52:57.735 --> 53:00.005
Alright? Here we go.

53:02.841 --> 53:05.743
Now, I want you
to take your legs

53:06.412 --> 53:09.014
and put them all the way
on the other side of the group.

53:09.914 --> 53:13.152
And then I want you
to take your torso

53:14.053 --> 53:17.822
and put it on top of your leg.

53:19.225 --> 53:24.029
And take your head
and put it on top of your neck.

53:25.397 --> 53:28.100
Now, I would like you
to make a new body

53:29.235 --> 53:30.469
right over here

53:31.003 --> 53:33.072
to replace the old body.

53:34.406 --> 53:38.344
You want to play snafu
with that body?

53:40.112 --> 53:41.113
Good.

53:41.746 --> 53:43.282
Now, make it two heads

53:44.150 --> 53:46.585
and put them where the hands
are supposed to be

53:47.386 --> 53:51.190
and take the hands and put them
where the head is supposed to be.

53:52.358 --> 53:53.292
And now,

53:54.726 --> 53:57.062
I want you to unshuffle

53:59.365 --> 54:00.865
until all there is,

54:01.333 --> 54:05.237
is one perfect body
unshuffled, with no name.

54:08.007 --> 54:10.109
Now, I want you to take
those revolvers.

54:11.676 --> 54:13.245
And I want you to cock them.

54:14.712 --> 54:15.914
And I want you

54:16.048 --> 54:18.384
to place them
directly up to the ear

54:19.151 --> 54:20.852
of the body to your right.

54:25.457 --> 54:28.127
And I am going
to count to three.

54:29.761 --> 54:31.696
And I want you
to pull the trigger.

54:33.265 --> 54:34.466
Alright.

54:35.833 --> 54:38.370
And one,

54:40.805 --> 54:42.041
two,

54:46.078 --> 54:47.947
three.

54:56.155 --> 54:57.722
Cut. Well, how did look?

54:57.855 --> 55:00.858
- Was it beautiful?
- I've never seen anything like that.

55:01.527 --> 55:02.661
My God.

55:03.229 --> 55:05.763
We will organize this
footage to a symphony,

55:06.232 --> 55:09.301
and then we'll broadcast it
at the stroke of midnight.

55:09.435 --> 55:11.769
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

55:11.903 --> 55:13.372
That was pretty.

55:16.442 --> 55:17.775
I knew it!

55:18.810 --> 55:20.212
That's what rich people do.

55:21.547 --> 55:24.383
Well, I... I don't do that.

55:25.517 --> 55:28.786
Wait, did this make
you stop loving me?

55:30.222 --> 55:32.424
Not sure if it made
me stop loving you.

55:33.325 --> 55:35.327
Just made me stop
loving overall.

55:35.860 --> 55:39.031
Look, my dad is
a particular individual.

55:39.164 --> 55:41.467
I mean, he...
he can make people do anything.

55:41.866 --> 55:43.469
Is your mom in on this?

55:44.902 --> 55:48.240
She's... she's...
she's in on it.

55:48.741 --> 55:51.577
Oh, do you want to go downstairs and get
another drink and then spy on my mom?

55:51.710 --> 55:54.446
I know where we can see into
her room without a computer,

55:54.580 --> 55:56.048
so no one can track us.

55:56.181 --> 55:58.217
I think I want to have
two more drinks than go home.

56:00.918 --> 56:02.321
You always do all the drugs.

56:02.454 --> 56:03.821
That's not true.

56:03.956 --> 56:05.557
Give me some
of the devil's dandruff.

56:06.191 --> 56:07.993
Look at this guy, Cynthia.

56:08.127 --> 56:09.827
You gotta shoot him
in the nuts, for sure.

56:10.529 --> 56:15.067
Hey, you want it so bad,
Rebecca? You do it.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.835
I don't know if I can get
a bullseye from here at all.

56:17.970 --> 56:19.871
You've been doing pretty
good in target practice.

56:20.005 --> 56:22.474
It's not nearly as hard a shot as
the ones who were making yesterday.

56:22.608 --> 56:25.244
It's true. You never
missed the target once.

56:25.678 --> 56:30.416
This is a far more technical shot
and his nuts are a moving target.

56:30.549 --> 56:33.585
Just don't panic
or overthink it in your head.

56:40.892 --> 56:42.494
Fuck!

56:44.997 --> 56:46.332
Fuck me!

56:50.035 --> 56:52.805
Damn, I know I'd miss, you guys
shouldn't have let me do that.

56:52.938 --> 56:54.872
I wouldn't exactly
call that miss, now.

56:55.007 --> 56:57.409
Look, are you gonna let him suffer
and draw attention, Rebecca?

56:57.543 --> 56:58.977
Or are you going
to finish him off?

56:59.111 --> 57:00.646
Can you just do it like normal?

57:00.779 --> 57:02.348
- I'm shaking now.
- No!

57:02.815 --> 57:04.383
This specimen is yours.

57:04.516 --> 57:05.484
Do it.

57:08.153 --> 57:12.624
Then I'm going to make a better
world for all you boys and girls.

57:15.627 --> 57:17.129
Fuck.

57:17.262 --> 57:20.332
This is so gross.
Can you just do it?

57:20.466 --> 57:22.468
Oh, it gets addictive.

57:22.601 --> 57:24.937
You'll probably start wanting
to do it again in a week.

57:25.371 --> 57:28.507
I think I'm gonna get nightmares
for the rest of my life.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.042
Yeah, that too.

57:38.083 --> 57:39.852
- You did it!
- Alright. Let's go check out the truck,

57:39.985 --> 57:41.886
and this better be flat screen
TVs like it's supposed to be.

57:42.020 --> 57:45.524
Little does she know
her skin is gonna fall out.

57:45.657 --> 57:48.026
Yeah, and then her hair
and her teeth will just follow.

57:50.763 --> 57:52.164
So much blood.

57:53.265 --> 57:55.601
- So many people.
- I know.

57:56.135 --> 57:58.137
Their timing was impeccable.

58:00.839 --> 58:03.776
- That was weird. That was really fucking weird.
- Don't worry about it.

58:03.908 --> 58:05.310
You can't tell me
that wasn't weird.

58:05.744 --> 58:07.079
I can't unsee what I just saw.

58:07.212 --> 58:09.281
Well, I'm telling you
not to worry about it.

58:10.416 --> 58:12.651
How do you not think
that was weird?

58:22.761 --> 58:25.431
Are you really gonna spy on your mom,
or did you bring me in here for sex?

58:25.564 --> 58:27.900
Ugh, don't talk about my mom
and sex at the same time.

58:28.033 --> 58:29.301
That's gross.
Totally not a turn on.

58:29.435 --> 58:31.670
Sorry, it's just
a really confusing position.

58:34.873 --> 58:36.375
Pour some whiskey in my mouth.

58:40.479 --> 58:42.948
Please, don't use
the power drill on me.

58:43.081 --> 58:44.917
This is complete madness.

58:45.083 --> 58:48.320
<i>In a mad
world, only the mad are sane.</i>

58:48.454 --> 58:51.457
He's trying to convince
you that you're crazy.

58:51.824 --> 58:53.058
Go away with him.

58:59.031 --> 59:01.800
<i>We both know that
you know why I have to do this to you.</i>

59:01.935 --> 59:03.635
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

59:04.670 --> 59:08.106
I could reschedule for next week
about drilling a hole in your brain,

59:08.240 --> 59:11.210
but I'm sorry.
I'm just too busy for that.

59:11.343 --> 59:12.744
It is what it is.

59:12.878 --> 59:15.481
I dropped the ball,
too busy for my pants.

59:16.048 --> 59:18.083
Mm, it's all my fault.

59:18.684 --> 59:19.651
Many blessings.

59:19.785 --> 59:21.653
Your mom is completely
out of her mind.

59:22.020 --> 59:24.890
She's talking to herself. She's about
to drill a hole in that poor guy's head.

59:25.023 --> 59:26.458
I know. Let's watch.

59:26.592 --> 59:28.861
- You watch, I want to go home.
- Give me a sec.

59:28.994 --> 59:31.163
I don't know anything about
your ramen noodle food truck.

59:31.296 --> 59:33.665
- Yes, you do!
- No, I don't.

59:34.099 --> 59:36.735
I'm feeling claustrophobic and
nauseous, can you take me home?

59:36.869 --> 59:40.038
Look, it is completely up to you whether
or not you want to tell the truth.

59:40.539 --> 59:43.342
Okay. You have the power
to do anything you want.

59:43.475 --> 59:46.578
What do ramen packets have to do
with business or... or anything

59:46.712 --> 59:47.846
I would even know about.

59:47.981 --> 59:49.983
Mrs. Wallendorf.

59:52.684 --> 59:55.621
No, no, no, no, no!

1:00:10.402 --> 1:00:12.638
- Get me out of here.
- Hey...

1:00:12.771 --> 1:00:14.606
Hey, don't panic, okay?

1:00:15.207 --> 1:00:16.575
We can go back
to your place now.

1:00:20.512 --> 1:00:23.382
You know, I'm actually kind
of sad that my mom killed Rick.

1:00:24.216 --> 1:00:25.784
I've known him my whole life.

1:00:32.524 --> 1:00:33.592
Oooh!

1:00:34.994 --> 1:00:38.463
You guys look like you're getting
ready to do something exciting.

1:00:38.597 --> 1:00:41.066
You guys look like
you just did something exciting.

1:00:41.199 --> 1:00:43.201
Yeah. What's up
with the costumes?

1:00:44.069 --> 1:00:46.438
I always knew rich people
were crazy, but I was wrong.

1:00:46.872 --> 1:00:49.675
They're really,
really, really crazy.

1:00:51.376 --> 1:00:53.412
We just came from my parent's
annual masked ball.

1:00:53.545 --> 1:00:55.881
Exactly.
That shit was not normal.

1:00:56.015 --> 1:00:58.350
I don't even know how to explain
what I just saw with words.

1:00:58.483 --> 1:01:00.118
It does sound like something.

1:01:00.552 --> 1:01:02.120
So, what are you guys
getting up to?

1:01:02.554 --> 1:01:04.423
We're actually going
to hit up a supermarket.

1:01:05.024 --> 1:01:09.094
- Can I come?
- You want to rob the supermarket with us?

1:01:09.595 --> 1:01:12.631
And I want to see
this crazy...

1:01:12.764 --> 1:01:14.968
fancy masked ball.

1:01:15.367 --> 1:01:18.037
So I'll let you come
with us on this robbery.

1:01:18.537 --> 1:01:20.906
If you bring me to your parent's
next party at their castle.

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:23.943
There's gonna be another crazy
party there in a few weeks

1:01:24.077 --> 1:01:26.311
so we won't even have
to wait the whole year.

1:01:27.212 --> 1:01:28.113
Cool.

1:01:29.581 --> 1:01:33.251
Cane? Why don't you
go change into some normal clothes?

1:01:33.385 --> 1:01:35.187
And Jennifer,
you can borrow some of ours.

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:36.655
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:01:49.868 --> 1:01:52.170
- Have you ever killed a man?
- No.

1:01:53.940 --> 1:01:55.173
Not directly.

1:01:57.576 --> 1:02:00.846
Well, there's this one
incident with one of my super fans,

1:02:00.980 --> 1:02:03.315
and he said he would kill himself
if I didn't fly to his apartment

1:02:03.448 --> 1:02:04.951
to give him a kiss.

1:02:05.484 --> 1:02:07.586
Yeah, I know.

1:02:08.286 --> 1:02:10.023
And then he hung
himself and posted it.

1:02:10.155 --> 1:02:11.356
I think it would
be a lot cleaner

1:02:11.490 --> 1:02:12.858
for your energy
if you just...

1:02:13.291 --> 1:02:15.394
...killed someone directly.

1:02:16.328 --> 1:02:19.598
Jennifer, take the machete
and go make your father proud.

1:02:20.799 --> 1:02:23.301
Anyone with a heart
only tastes death once.

1:02:24.937 --> 1:02:28.041
Just, uh,
skip on over there and, uh,

1:02:28.473 --> 1:02:30.809
turn that security
guard into sashimi.

1:02:32.277 --> 1:02:35.280
And he won't even recognize you're
a threat until it's too late.

1:02:36.181 --> 1:02:37.649
Well, I'm... I'm... I'm scared.

1:02:37.783 --> 1:02:40.419
In fact,
that guy probably has a gun.

1:02:43.990 --> 1:02:45.524
Aw...

1:02:57.569 --> 1:03:01.840
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

1:03:33.505 --> 1:03:35.507
What the fuck?

1:03:39.344 --> 1:03:40.980
Good night.

1:03:41.114 --> 1:03:42.347
Let's go.

1:03:54.359 --> 1:03:56.561
Hit it again!

1:03:59.431 --> 1:04:00.432
Hey, get off.

1:04:00.565 --> 1:04:02.001
Cane, get out of my way.

1:04:06.838 --> 1:04:09.674
Well,
that was a bit disorganized.

1:04:26.259 --> 1:04:27.826
Whoa, yeeha!

1:04:35.767 --> 1:04:38.837
Get it, like, meat, meat.

1:04:43.842 --> 1:04:46.045
- Oh God, it's stuck!
- Go, giddiup.

1:04:46.179 --> 1:04:49.648
Oh... Okay. Okay, cool.
Let's go, let's go.

1:04:50.950 --> 1:04:52.684
What are you doing?
Why is your helmet off?

1:04:52.818 --> 1:04:53.685
There's cameras everywhere.

1:04:54.653 --> 1:04:57.355
You're so anxious to hit the ball
and so afraid that you won't,

1:04:57.856 --> 1:04:59.724
you can't even see
the beauty of the fruit.

1:05:36.561 --> 1:05:37.762
That looks pretty good.

1:05:38.197 --> 1:05:39.531
That?

1:05:44.369 --> 1:05:45.570
Wow.

1:05:46.005 --> 1:05:46.939
Ah, it's good.

1:05:47.340 --> 1:05:50.609
It's like an explosion
of flavors in my mouth.

1:05:52.510 --> 1:05:53.745
What kind of steak is that?

1:05:54.646 --> 1:05:56.448
- Good cows.
- Hm.

1:05:57.883 --> 1:05:59.451
I think we should
hit a house next.

1:05:59.986 --> 1:06:02.387
I don't do home invasions.
This is not cool.

1:06:03.122 --> 1:06:05.624
I've tracked a handful
of people on social media.

1:06:05.757 --> 1:06:08.460
They have, like,
$100,000 diamond rings

1:06:08.593 --> 1:06:11.563
and crazy necklaces
and jewelry cases.

1:06:12.198 --> 1:06:14.033
If you hit one of these houses,
I think we can make,

1:06:14.166 --> 1:06:17.103
like, hundreds of thousands
of dollars. No joke.

1:06:17.535 --> 1:06:19.638
Families are in houses.

1:06:20.273 --> 1:06:21.539
Cane, women and children.

1:06:21.673 --> 1:06:23.309
That's different
than the truck drivers,

1:06:23.441 --> 1:06:24.643
security guards.

1:06:25.077 --> 1:06:27.512
I understand about not
wanting to hurt any children.

1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:29.181
But why no women?

1:06:29.648 --> 1:06:30.815
You kill guys all the time.

1:06:30.950 --> 1:06:32.385
Why wouldn't you kill a woman?

1:06:33.352 --> 1:06:36.621
Staying away from women
and children is customary.

1:06:37.589 --> 1:06:39.624
I think you just
like killing men.

1:06:40.892 --> 1:06:43.129
- What?
- Killing men.

1:06:43.495 --> 1:06:45.298
I think you've justified
it in your brain,

1:06:45.664 --> 1:06:46.865
and you enjoy murdering men.

1:06:46.999 --> 1:06:48.034
Mhm...

1:06:49.868 --> 1:06:52.537
Cane, you've been
a missing person

1:06:52.671 --> 1:06:54.572
since you were, like, nine.

1:06:56.641 --> 1:06:58.010
If you disappeared,

1:06:58.144 --> 1:06:59.412
it wouldn't even count

1:06:59.844 --> 1:07:03.715
because you're already not here.

1:07:09.055 --> 1:07:10.855
A lot of people like
to put stuff in their bags,

1:07:10.990 --> 1:07:12.992
but I personally just
like to put more bags.

1:07:13.125 --> 1:07:16.062
The great thing about this one
is you could fit a lot.

1:07:16.828 --> 1:07:18.030
What are you drinking?

1:07:18.797 --> 1:07:20.632
I just stick
to straight tequila.

1:07:20.765 --> 1:07:23.868
I'm glad everyone's enjoying
all the fancy cocktails,

1:07:24.003 --> 1:07:26.205
but fancy drinks make me sick.

1:07:27.906 --> 1:07:30.009
Yeah, me too. Mm-hmm.

1:07:30.142 --> 1:07:33.578
That's why I'm... I'm...
I'm drinking straight whiskey.

1:07:34.447 --> 1:07:35.680
Straight whiskey.

1:07:36.282 --> 1:07:38.250
I love you all so much.

1:07:40.286 --> 1:07:43.189
Stew, can I get more
coconut rum in here?

1:07:43.655 --> 1:07:45.924
And vodka and berries

1:07:46.058 --> 1:07:48.194
and want to add
some whipped cream on top?

1:07:48.327 --> 1:07:50.129
But you sure you don't want
the berries on top?

1:07:50.262 --> 1:07:51.964
Because if I put the berries
under the whipped cream,

1:07:52.098 --> 1:07:54.233
- then it's gonna taste a little...
- Do as I say!

1:07:55.434 --> 1:07:56.735
Oooh...

1:07:59.338 --> 1:08:01.107
Cherries, cherries and rum...

1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:03.608
- Come on, Stew.
- Make it fast, hurry up.

1:08:03.742 --> 1:08:05.177
At your service.

1:08:06.544 --> 1:08:08.580
Now kiss me.

1:08:08.713 --> 1:08:10.149
You mean right now?

1:08:10.749 --> 1:08:12.817
When do you think I mean?

1:08:13.419 --> 1:08:16.888
I just wasn't sure, uh,
sometimes you make me nervous.

1:08:17.323 --> 1:08:18.857
You have a lot of demands.

1:08:19.291 --> 1:08:21.227
Yeah? I'm demanding?

1:08:21.693 --> 1:08:24.596
- Mm?
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:24.729 --> 1:08:25.897
Get it, girl.

1:08:30.735 --> 1:08:33.172
- Did you like that?
- Okay, I'm not really good at this.

1:08:33.305 --> 1:08:37.009
And what I mean
by that is... that I did.

1:08:37.542 --> 1:08:38.810
Me too.

1:08:39.478 --> 1:08:40.812
You wanna a sip of my drink?

1:08:40.946 --> 1:08:43.282
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Oh, he's like a little baby.

1:08:47.386 --> 1:08:48.421
It's good.

1:08:48.853 --> 1:08:53.625
Ha-ha!
Wow, well how about this?

1:08:58.464 --> 1:09:03.235
- I'm sorry, did I make you mad?
- No. You're like my favorite person.

1:09:06.138 --> 1:09:09.641
Can you make me another drink
with this straw for each of us?

1:09:10.242 --> 1:09:12.344
- Thank you.
- Don't mess it up, Stew.

1:09:14.579 --> 1:09:15.647
Oh, straw... straw.

1:09:27.792 --> 1:09:29.594
You said I was
your favorite person.

1:09:29.727 --> 1:09:31.863
You are.

1:09:36.469 --> 1:09:38.504
Oh, I think we should give
these to some space.

1:09:38.938 --> 1:09:40.239
Wanna go hang out over there?

1:09:41.340 --> 1:09:42.607
Oh, okay.

1:09:51.383 --> 1:09:53.152
One of the funniest ones

1:09:53.285 --> 1:09:56.956
was when we accidentally jacked
a ramen noodle soup truck.

1:09:58.591 --> 1:09:59.492
- Oh, um...
- You okay there?

1:09:59.624 --> 1:10:00.692
Ramen truck?

1:10:01.227 --> 1:10:03.596
Why did you, um,
jack a ramen truck?

1:10:03.728 --> 1:10:05.531
I was... it was a mistake.

1:10:05.663 --> 1:10:08.800
To be honest, it was supposed
to be Wallendorf shoes, but.

1:10:08.934 --> 1:10:12.171
We just... we just
ditched in a swamp.

1:10:12.571 --> 1:10:13.973
Huh.

1:10:15.441 --> 1:10:17.977
What, um... what swamp?

1:10:19.777 --> 1:10:20.745
Why?

1:10:21.514 --> 1:10:24.583
Well, um, I was just wondering
if you could take a picture

1:10:24.716 --> 1:10:26.885
of me in front of the truck,
so I could post it online.

1:10:27.019 --> 1:10:30.922
You can't have a phone or any
electronics here or near the truck.

1:10:31.056 --> 1:10:33.259
- We... you...
- I know the rules.

1:10:33.392 --> 1:10:36.728
The only thing I ever bring with
me is this antique Polaroid camera.

1:10:37.829 --> 1:10:39.064
They can't be traced.

1:10:41.433 --> 1:10:44.603
I will take you to the truck.
If you tell me

1:10:44.736 --> 1:10:47.672
- the truth about the red shoes.
- What do you mean?

1:10:49.175 --> 1:10:51.243
I mean, they're...
they're just red shoes.

1:10:53.946 --> 1:10:55.847
Keep talking,
I'll show you the truck.

1:10:56.282 --> 1:10:57.016
Okay.

1:10:57.149 --> 1:10:59.118
- Catch up.
- Uh, Okay.

1:11:01.420 --> 1:11:03.389
So you're
saying the populace

1:11:03.522 --> 1:11:07.859
sell their soul for a pair
of red shoes that they buy?

1:11:12.164 --> 1:11:13.898
You want to pose
for the picture?

1:12:29.108 --> 1:12:31.776
[Cynthia} I don't think she's
gonna be conscious anytime soon.

1:12:36.448 --> 1:12:37.950
Just go home.

1:12:40.686 --> 1:12:42.787
<i>I'm not worth fighting over.</i>

1:12:43.921 --> 1:12:45.157
Cane,

1:12:46.492 --> 1:12:47.825
you're mine.

1:13:07.279 --> 1:13:08.514
<i>Pumpkin.</i>

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:16.455
<i>He's yours, pumpkin.</i>

1:13:47.319 --> 1:13:48.821
Jennifer, it's not
what it looks like.

1:13:48.954 --> 1:13:50.589
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what it looks like.

1:13:50.723 --> 1:13:52.624
Jennifer... Jennifer,
it's not what it looks like.

1:13:53.891 --> 1:13:57.930
Yeah, it's... it's not
what it looks like. It's...

1:14:00.599 --> 1:14:02.101
It's what it feels like.

1:14:03.868 --> 1:14:05.471
Jennifer... Jennifer, wait.

1:14:06.472 --> 1:14:09.708
Jennifer, wait.
Jennifer. Fuck!

1:14:42.775 --> 1:14:44.909
Hold, hold.

1:14:47.646 --> 1:14:49.114
Hold.

1:14:56.921 --> 1:14:59.558
Thank you, thank you.

1:15:00.159 --> 1:15:01.760
Many blessings.

1:15:01.894 --> 1:15:04.329
I can't see. I feel dizzy.

1:15:10.502 --> 1:15:12.671
You're okay?

1:15:20.179 --> 1:15:22.481
Ah, perfect. That's perfect.

1:15:25.617 --> 1:15:26.819
I'm okay, I just...

1:15:27.319 --> 1:15:28.821
just didn't eat enough today.

1:15:29.555 --> 1:15:31.924
Well, eating was our original plan
when we came into the kitchen.

1:15:32.224 --> 1:15:38.230
And that's why I made you a
delicious, healthy, vegan ramen.

1:15:40.299 --> 1:15:41.935
You should do what I do.

1:15:42.067 --> 1:15:43.769
- What is that?
- Every morning,

1:15:43.902 --> 1:15:45.404
I have an entire block of tofu

1:15:45.537 --> 1:15:47.239
with absolutely nothing,
completely raw.

1:15:47.372 --> 1:15:49.107
- Yeah?
- Then, no matter what happens,

1:15:49.708 --> 1:15:51.610
I'm properly nourished
throughout the day.

1:15:51.743 --> 1:15:52.978
Really?

1:15:55.949 --> 1:15:57.416
That is delicious.

1:16:00.786 --> 1:16:01.420
Mmmm!

1:16:02.921 --> 1:16:03.655
Oh my...

1:16:04.990 --> 1:16:09.661
So, all the gold in the entire
ramen noodles trunk are gone?

1:16:10.662 --> 1:16:11.697
Officially?

1:16:12.364 --> 1:16:15.133
Without a... without a trace?

1:16:16.535 --> 1:16:18.704
- I'm such an idiot.
- No.

1:16:19.171 --> 1:16:20.706
- It's all my fault.
- No, no, no.

1:16:22.741 --> 1:16:24.042
I did everything right.

1:16:24.176 --> 1:16:25.477
I don't know
how this could have happened.

1:16:25.611 --> 1:16:27.446
You know what they say
about plans, right?

1:16:27.579 --> 1:16:31.350
"Best plan B is
to do plan A again."

1:16:31.483 --> 1:16:33.452
- Do the whole thing all over again?
- Mm-hmm.

1:16:33.585 --> 1:16:34.686
It took years.

1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:37.456
I am confident
that between the two of us,

1:16:37.589 --> 1:16:43.529
we can transport over six billion
dollars in untraceable gold.

1:16:43.662 --> 1:16:46.698
Then we can still fly away
to that secret palace in Fiji.

1:16:46.832 --> 1:16:48.100
- That's right.
- Oh...

1:16:48.534 --> 1:16:50.202
You're such a blessing.

1:16:52.404 --> 1:16:53.940
I'm sick
of my degenerate daughter

1:16:54.072 --> 1:16:56.976
and my power crazed husband
drinking out of my cup

1:16:57.409 --> 1:16:59.411
and putting pots on my fire.

1:16:59.545 --> 1:17:01.680
Oh, baby.
Come here.

1:17:30.142 --> 1:17:32.878
Family values,
human relationships,

1:17:33.679 --> 1:17:38.250
these are the seeds
upon which all success grows.

1:17:38.617 --> 1:17:40.987
What do you say to
all the people who think

1:17:41.119 --> 1:17:46.525
your commercials and photography are unclassy,
vile and encourage violent crimes and suicide.

1:17:46.892 --> 1:17:48.427
Well, you know,

1:17:48.962 --> 1:17:50.629
it's hard, darling.

1:17:51.663 --> 1:17:55.001
I consider myself
above all else an artist

1:17:55.601 --> 1:17:58.770
and a self-help guru.

1:17:58.904 --> 1:18:01.306
What do you think about the
rumors circulating and the theories

1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:02.741
that your commercials are real?

1:18:02.874 --> 1:18:04.843
What do you think
about the rumors circulating

1:18:04.978 --> 1:18:05.877
that the earth is flat?

1:18:09.214 --> 1:18:11.951
Everyone wants to know
why you only make red shoes.

1:18:12.085 --> 1:18:15.854
Do you ever have any intentions of making
other clothes or other colors of shoes?

1:18:16.622 --> 1:18:21.094
My sense of art and design start
and stop at red women's shoes.

1:18:21.226 --> 1:18:23.963
Mr. Wallendorf,
what about shoes for men?

1:18:24.097 --> 1:18:25.330
What about it?

1:18:26.065 --> 1:18:29.601
Men wear my shoes. Everybody
knows men love my shoes.

1:18:30.036 --> 1:18:33.639
I'm not going to change my
design to cater to a male market.

1:18:39.177 --> 1:18:40.779
[woman
<i>One more question.</i>

1:18:55.193 --> 1:18:56.361
Why did you have to cheat on me

1:18:56.495 --> 1:18:58.463
when I was passed
out downstairs?

1:18:58.597 --> 1:19:00.399
I mean, what were you thinking?

1:19:19.651 --> 1:19:21.620
Is there anything I can do?

1:19:22.955 --> 1:19:25.190
Can I get some more
champagne, Nate?

1:19:25.323 --> 1:19:26.425
Of course.

1:19:27.225 --> 1:19:30.228
You know, my name is not Nathan.

1:19:33.665 --> 1:19:35.001
Do you know who I am?

1:19:35.434 --> 1:19:36.668
You're Jennifer Wallendorf.

1:19:41.206 --> 1:19:45.911
Do you want me to make you the most
famous bartender in town, Nate?

1:19:46.045 --> 1:19:47.080
Of course.

1:19:47.512 --> 1:19:48.780
What do you have in mind?

1:19:49.115 --> 1:19:50.016
Make out with me.

1:19:50.149 --> 1:19:51.084
I'll film it,

1:19:51.216 --> 1:19:53.119
post it and tag you in it.

1:19:53.485 --> 1:19:54.786
What's the catch?

1:19:55.287 --> 1:19:56.621
There's no catch.

1:19:57.123 --> 1:19:58.457
Now, uh,

1:19:59.192 --> 1:20:00.392
get us two shots of tequila,

1:20:00.525 --> 1:20:01.860
pour yourself
a glass of champagne,

1:20:01.994 --> 1:20:05.263
and let's do this.

1:21:08.527 --> 1:21:09.861
I challenge you to a fight

1:21:09.996 --> 1:21:12.131
and the loser's penalty
is permanent banishment.

1:21:14.934 --> 1:21:17.502
Well, Jennifer, you're even
crazier than I thought.

1:21:17.636 --> 1:21:20.806
Oh yeah,
way crazier than you thought.

1:21:21.606 --> 1:21:23.375
I don't want to have
to hurt you.

1:21:24.210 --> 1:21:26.578
Just be one of my girls. Yeah?

1:21:27.312 --> 1:21:28.647
Like everybody else.

1:21:30.682 --> 1:21:32.151
You have no choice.

1:21:32.651 --> 1:21:33.819
Maybe you have no choice.

1:21:33.953 --> 1:21:36.521
I mean,
they are your stupid laws.

1:21:37.190 --> 1:21:39.992
You really want to fight me?

1:21:40.525 --> 1:21:42.727
And the loser gets
banished forever.

1:21:49.367 --> 1:21:51.070
I thought you were my friend.

1:21:52.972 --> 1:21:55.241
So yeah,
now I'm gonna banish you

1:21:55.373 --> 1:21:56.775
and not just that,

1:21:56.908 --> 1:21:59.312
I'm gonna beat you to a pulp.

1:22:06.185 --> 1:22:07.987
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

1:22:11.923 --> 1:22:13.025
You're cute.

1:22:14.026 --> 1:22:15.127
I am. Thank you.

1:22:15.927 --> 1:22:21.067
Why don't we go over to the bar and
have Stew write up some combat rules?

1:22:21.733 --> 1:22:24.502
- Great.
- Great.

1:22:28.807 --> 1:22:29.808
Stew!

1:22:31.344 --> 1:22:32.377
Can I get you ladies a drink?

1:22:32.510 --> 1:22:35.014
- No.
- No. Stew, combat rules.

1:22:35.147 --> 1:22:36.315
Who's fighting?

1:22:36.448 --> 1:22:38.516
Jennifer is challenging me.

1:22:38.650 --> 1:22:41.153
You're... you're drunk, and you're
planning to use the bartender...

1:22:41.287 --> 1:22:42.188
I get it.

1:22:42.821 --> 1:22:44.357
- It's not a joke.
- Well, if it's not a joke,

1:22:44.489 --> 1:22:46.058
it sounds like
a really bad plan.

1:22:46.192 --> 1:22:48.560
I already tried convincing
her not to do it.

1:22:48.693 --> 1:22:50.997
Yeah, she's insisting on combat.

1:22:51.596 --> 1:22:53.431
Okay, well, my job is
to write down the rules.

1:22:53.565 --> 1:22:55.400
I don't... want
to get challenged.

1:22:55.533 --> 1:23:01.606
Jennifer, you should make the choices
in regards to weapons and rules.

1:23:02.141 --> 1:23:03.109
We will fight naked.

1:23:03.675 --> 1:23:05.211
What?

1:23:05.344 --> 1:23:06.678
If you want to back out now,

1:23:06.811 --> 1:23:07.812
I guess you're just gonna
get banished forever.

1:23:07.947 --> 1:23:09.447
Hey, I don't want to back out.

1:23:09.581 --> 1:23:12.617
I just think naked
is a stupid outfit.

1:23:13.718 --> 1:23:15.654
I don't want to hurt
you that bad.

1:23:17.522 --> 1:23:18.924
Yes, you do.

1:23:22.594 --> 1:23:26.032
Okay. I guess tomorrow
we will fight naked,

1:23:26.165 --> 1:23:27.400
and I will knock you out

1:23:27.866 --> 1:23:29.268
and then make sure
you're safe

1:23:29.402 --> 1:23:30.735
when you're unconscious.

1:23:31.304 --> 1:23:33.672
And then I'll leave you in a
wheelbarrow in the middle of town.

1:23:33.805 --> 1:23:36.309
Great, except you're gonna be the one
that's gonna be in the wheelbarrow.

1:23:36.441 --> 1:23:38.877
Okay, so let's get back to the point.
We're gonna fight naked

1:23:39.011 --> 1:23:40.845
except for Wallendorf
red high-heel shoes,

1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:42.514
which will be
duct-taped to our feet.

1:23:42.647 --> 1:23:45.351
And the fight will be
tomorrow at high noon.

1:23:45.483 --> 1:23:46.918
I agree.

1:24:19.251 --> 1:24:21.988
I suppose love and gold
are somewhat similar.

1:24:24.689 --> 1:24:27.926
There's always murder involved
when the other one is on the line.

1:24:48.847 --> 1:24:50.216
How's it going?

1:24:51.750 --> 1:24:52.952
Um, I'm fine.

1:24:53.986 --> 1:24:58.790
I always eat a steak
before a fight or a heist.

1:24:59.591 --> 1:25:01.093
It's the only time
I eat red meat.

1:25:01.826 --> 1:25:03.195
Yeah, make sense.

1:25:21.447 --> 1:25:24.682
Would you consider

1:25:26.185 --> 1:25:29.221
fooling around with me
tonight before the fight?

1:25:33.758 --> 1:25:36.162
Crazier and crazier, Jennifer.

1:25:38.097 --> 1:25:39.664
Was that, like, your last wish?

1:25:40.132 --> 1:25:43.635
Fool around before I beat
you up and banish you forever?

1:25:47.073 --> 1:25:48.107
Yes.

1:25:50.675 --> 1:25:52.577
I don't normally
fool around with girls.

1:25:53.412 --> 1:25:55.613
But if it's
the famous and infamous

1:25:55.747 --> 1:25:58.084
Jennifer Wallendorf's
last wish, then...

1:26:00.519 --> 1:26:03.888
I'll do it. I might need an
extra glass of wine or two first.

1:26:04.323 --> 1:26:08.693
You're playing it cool,
but I know you want to.

1:26:47.699 --> 1:26:49.068
Do you wanna play a game?

1:26:50.302 --> 1:26:51.237
Sure,

1:26:51.803 --> 1:26:52.737
whatever you want.

1:26:54.607 --> 1:26:55.840
Okay.

1:27:01.013 --> 1:27:02.714
This game is called...

1:27:05.884 --> 1:27:07.286
put daddy in the room.

1:27:20.132 --> 1:27:25.137
Cynthia! Cynthia!

1:27:29.707 --> 1:27:32.077
Cynthia! Cynthia!

1:27:32.211 --> 1:27:34.346
Wait, wait, wait.
It's past noon.

1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:37.316
Let's go check her room.

1:27:38.716 --> 1:27:42.454
Cynthia! Cynthia!

1:27:55.367 --> 1:27:56.468
No.

1:27:59.737 --> 1:28:01.106
Cut her down.

1:28:23.529 --> 1:28:25.164
Hey, pumpkin.

1:28:26.065 --> 1:28:27.466
Told you not to call me that.

1:28:27.865 --> 1:28:28.968
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:28:29.101 --> 1:28:30.603
It's just an old habit.

1:28:31.604 --> 1:28:34.406
When you were a baby,
you were such a little pumpkin.

1:28:34.940 --> 1:28:36.275
That's okay.

1:28:37.276 --> 1:28:38.978
I'm not a pumpkin anymore.

1:28:41.879 --> 1:28:44.782
And you are
a megalo-narcissist.

1:28:44.916 --> 1:28:46.218
Shit.

1:28:47.653 --> 1:28:49.887
I don't even know what
a megalo-narcissist is.

1:28:50.022 --> 1:28:51.823
It's someone like you.

1:28:52.658 --> 1:28:54.693
- Mm-hmm.
- You've made what,

1:28:54.826 --> 1:28:56.928
half the world
dependent on you, Dad?

1:28:58.030 --> 1:28:59.965
You're like a boy band,

1:29:00.599 --> 1:29:02.167
corporate kingpin.

1:29:03.868 --> 1:29:06.272
A pop singer with rhythm,

1:29:06.405 --> 1:29:09.141
but no soul.

1:29:10.409 --> 1:29:12.444
What kind of language
is this, pumpkin?

1:29:14.647 --> 1:29:16.048
You playing a game with me?

1:29:18.050 --> 1:29:20.785
I know there's no
red shoes, Dad.

1:29:21.153 --> 1:29:23.788
You're gathering people's
personal information,

1:29:23.921 --> 1:29:25.357
storing it in your supercomputer

1:29:25.491 --> 1:29:28.460
and then selling it off
to the highest bidder.

1:29:31.964 --> 1:29:33.265
You're a wizard...

1:29:35.067 --> 1:29:37.569
turning people
into frogs just for fun.

1:29:38.803 --> 1:29:40.205
But you're nobody.

1:29:42.174 --> 1:29:46.378
You are absolutely nobody.

1:29:46.512 --> 1:29:48.013
My, my, my.

1:29:49.148 --> 1:29:51.216
I guess my little girl
has grown up.

1:29:52.318 --> 1:29:55.054
No more reason to call you
pumpkin, is there, Jennifer?

1:29:55.754 --> 1:29:57.389
There's no red shoes.

1:29:58.157 --> 1:30:00.192
It's a house of cards,

1:30:01.826 --> 1:30:03.128
smoke and mirrors.

1:30:04.463 --> 1:30:05.431
Well, Dad.

1:30:05.964 --> 1:30:08.567
When you live in a house
made of cards,

1:30:10.436 --> 1:30:12.037
you shouldn't play with fire.

1:30:13.238 --> 1:30:15.407
I'm initiating
the congratulations game.

1:30:18.010 --> 1:30:20.646
You can't initiate
the congratulations game.

1:30:21.113 --> 1:30:22.314
Yes, I can.

1:30:22.448 --> 1:30:24.583
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I really can.

1:30:24.717 --> 1:30:27.286
No, you cannot initiate
the congratulations game.

1:30:27.419 --> 1:30:28.886
I'm the only one
that can do that.

1:30:29.021 --> 1:30:30.322
It's encrypted.

1:30:30.756 --> 1:30:35.127
Voice, facial,
retina recognition software.

1:30:36.128 --> 1:30:38.097
It is my most protected program.

1:30:38.931 --> 1:30:41.500
<i>How many of your super
fans do you want me to kill, Dad?</i>

1:30:41.934 --> 1:30:44.336
A hundred thousand? Maybe more.

1:30:45.437 --> 1:30:46.572
Pumpkin.

1:30:47.606 --> 1:30:51.577
It is impossible for you to
initiate the congratulations game.

1:30:57.616 --> 1:30:59.385
- Hello?
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

1:31:04.723 --> 1:31:05.923
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1:31:09.228 --> 1:31:10.562
- Hello.
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

1:31:14.299 --> 1:31:15.900
- Hello?
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

1:31:24.977 --> 1:31:26.512
- Hello?
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

1:31:26.645 --> 1:31:29.982
You just won a five-star trip
to the moon in a body bag.

1:32:06.552 --> 1:32:07.719
Sweetheart.

1:32:09.688 --> 1:32:10.989
What are you doing?

1:32:20.132 --> 1:32:21.500
You stole my gold?

1:32:21.633 --> 1:32:23.001
No, I didn't.

1:32:23.569 --> 1:32:24.570
Chad did.

1:32:28.207 --> 1:32:29.875
That's all my fault.

1:32:30.275 --> 1:32:31.577
I should have known.

1:32:31.710 --> 1:32:33.679
<i>You should have known
but you didn't.</i>

1:32:34.146 --> 1:32:36.682
<i>Now you know. Murder Chad.</i>

1:32:37.115 --> 1:32:40.786
<i>Get the gold and take
your daughter to Fiji instead.</i>

1:32:40.919 --> 1:32:42.488
Mom, what are you doing?

1:32:42.921 --> 1:32:44.223
Of course it was Chad.

1:32:45.023 --> 1:32:46.291
How did you know there
was gold inside?

1:32:46.425 --> 1:32:47.893
And how did you know
where to find the truck?

1:32:48.026 --> 1:32:50.462
Well, Chad took me to the truck,

1:32:50.596 --> 1:32:52.297
and then he took
this picture of me,

1:32:52.431 --> 1:32:53.432
and then he kissed me,

1:32:53.565 --> 1:32:54.968
and said he wanted to marry me,

1:32:55.100 --> 1:32:57.069
and that he was gonna
take me away

1:32:57.202 --> 1:32:58.470
from all of this
with the gold,

1:32:58.604 --> 1:32:59.939
and we'd go wherever I wanted,

1:33:00.072 --> 1:33:02.174
Fiji or anywhere else.

1:33:02.841 --> 1:33:04.009
What did you do?

1:33:05.844 --> 1:33:06.946
Instead of going to my room?

1:33:07.779 --> 1:33:10.449
I came here to show
you the picture

1:33:10.582 --> 1:33:13.385
and... and tell
you what happened.

1:33:14.019 --> 1:33:15.420
Of course.

1:33:16.688 --> 1:33:18.423
This is such a blessing.

1:33:19.625 --> 1:33:21.493
Can you go get Chad
and bring him here?

1:33:21.627 --> 1:33:23.495
We'll have to kill him
before we go to Fiji.

1:33:23.929 --> 1:33:25.130
Okay, I'll get him.

1:33:25.898 --> 1:33:29.234
Even though the core business
is a smaller part of the pie

1:33:29.368 --> 1:33:31.670
than it was last year.
It's actually grown.

1:33:32.170 --> 1:33:34.873
It's just that all the other
businesses are also growing

1:33:35.008 --> 1:33:36.408
and even multiplying.

1:33:38.143 --> 1:33:39.478
Miss Wallendorf.

1:33:40.512 --> 1:33:42.514
Can we help you with something?

1:33:42.648 --> 1:33:44.683
My mother would like
to see you, Chad.

1:33:45.450 --> 1:33:47.419
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:33:47.819 --> 1:33:48.820
Come on.

1:33:52.324 --> 1:33:54.826
Excuse me.

1:34:09.008 --> 1:34:10.409
Jennifer.

1:34:11.310 --> 1:34:14.680
Your mom is not here.

1:34:19.685 --> 1:34:20.987
Well, hey.

1:34:21.119 --> 1:34:22.788
Oh, oh...

1:34:46.645 --> 1:34:47.846
Oh, wow.

1:34:48.847 --> 1:34:50.115
You did good, Chad.

1:34:50.415 --> 1:34:51.750
What happened?

1:34:52.250 --> 1:34:53.752
You did good.

1:35:04.329 --> 1:35:06.398
Let go, my darling angel.

1:35:06.531 --> 1:35:08.266
Your spirit is free.

1:35:09.068 --> 1:35:11.236
Free! Free!

1:35:13.039 --> 1:35:16.408
Okay. Mom, mom, mom, I think...
I think Chad's dead now.

1:35:16.541 --> 1:35:18.510
You can never be sure with
these tough guys, sweetheart.

1:35:18.644 --> 1:35:20.145
You've got a double kill them.

1:35:20.278 --> 1:35:23.049
Make sure they're good and dead.

1:35:24.549 --> 1:35:27.919
And you can be pretty sure they're dead,
but it's really hard to kill someone.

1:35:28.054 --> 1:35:31.090
It's not like in the movies, where you
just stabs the guy and he falls down.

1:35:31.958 --> 1:35:36.795
You really got to make sure
they're good and dead in real life.

1:35:36.928 --> 1:35:39.132
Okay, I get it.

1:35:39.264 --> 1:35:40.599
Chad's definitely dead.

1:35:40.732 --> 1:35:42.634
He's gone. No more Chad.

1:35:42.768 --> 1:35:44.736
I'll just get him one
more time for the brains.

1:35:44.870 --> 1:35:46.039
Uh, welcome.

1:35:51.543 --> 1:35:53.445
By now, I'm pretty sure
that he's gone, sweetheart.

1:35:53.578 --> 1:35:55.714
- So what's the plan now?
- I'm gonna radio,

1:35:55.847 --> 1:35:57.050
and I'm gonna
have the largest jet

1:35:57.182 --> 1:35:58.550
fueled up and put on the runway,

1:35:58.684 --> 1:35:59.952
then you...

1:36:00.652 --> 1:36:03.588
you... you're gonna
bring me to this truck.

1:36:04.157 --> 1:36:06.358
We'll get the gold,
we'll put it on the jet...

1:36:06.491 --> 1:36:08.794
Do we have enough fuel
to get from here to Fiji?

1:36:08.927 --> 1:36:10.029
No problem.

1:36:10.462 --> 1:36:12.297
Did you know the plane has
a navigation system in it

1:36:12.431 --> 1:36:15.134
that's actually easier
to use than a car?

1:36:15.734 --> 1:36:17.937
I know how to land the jet, mom.

1:36:18.336 --> 1:36:20.706
Oh, yes.

1:36:40.492 --> 1:36:42.828
So what are we gonna do in Fiji
when we land with all the gold?

1:36:42.962 --> 1:36:45.430
The Fijians are such good
people. You're gonna love them.

1:36:45.897 --> 1:36:48.935
They have top chefs and wine
because of all the tourism.

1:36:49.668 --> 1:36:51.903
The local cuisine is to die for.

1:37:11.090 --> 1:37:12.357
- Jennifer?
- Oops.

1:37:12.491 --> 1:37:13.458
Don't drop the gold.

1:37:13.592 --> 1:37:14.760
It was an accident.

1:37:15.962 --> 1:37:17.462
What are you doing?

1:37:40.086 --> 1:37:43.022
I just wanted to say thank you

1:37:43.455 --> 1:37:47.960
to everyone and, um, goodbye.

1:37:49.461 --> 1:37:51.329
This is a celebration.

1:37:53.365 --> 1:37:54.666
Cheers.

1:39:10.042 --> 1:39:10.943
Mmm...

1:39:12.211 --> 1:39:13.678
Did it look real?

1:39:14.247 --> 1:39:17.549
Yeah, it looked real.

1:39:18.985 --> 1:39:21.120
- I thought you were dead.
- Aw...

1:39:21.254 --> 1:39:24.389
That was just a very basic
special visual effect.

1:39:30.662 --> 1:39:33.431
I have a jet filled with gold,

1:39:33.865 --> 1:39:35.400
and we're going to fly
to Fiji in it

1:39:35.901 --> 1:39:38.436
and stay in my family's
secret castle.

1:39:42.275 --> 1:39:43.541
This is different.

1:39:45.144 --> 1:39:46.511
My parents are dead.

1:39:47.545 --> 1:39:48.847
Everyone thinks I'm dead.

1:39:50.515 --> 1:39:52.717
No one knows that
this place exists.

1:39:54.619 --> 1:39:58.723
So you and I are gonna
fly the jet to Fiji,

1:39:59.791 --> 1:40:01.860
and then it's gonna
fly back without us.

1:40:05.965 --> 1:40:06.933
Come on.

1:40:08.100 --> 1:40:09.135
Follow me.

1:40:10.802 --> 1:40:12.570
Might as well at this point.

1:40:17.944 --> 1:40:21.579
How did this happen? You were
all friends with Jennifer Wallendorf?

1:40:22.114 --> 1:40:23.748
We're just as surprised
as you are.

1:40:23.882 --> 1:40:25.217
We were friends of Jennifer's,

1:40:25.351 --> 1:40:27.153
but we didn't know her parents.

1:40:30.990 --> 1:40:33.491
It felt so good to be bad.

1:40:33.625 --> 1:40:37.063
We are going to drink to Stew

1:40:37.196 --> 1:40:40.199
and to all of
the wonderful bad girls.

1:40:41.133 --> 1:40:42.534
Okay, but why?

1:40:43.102 --> 1:40:45.071
I left Wallendorf shoes
to the crew,

1:40:45.204 --> 1:40:47.906
along with everything else
that my family owns.

1:40:48.441 --> 1:40:49.841
Well, I'll drink to that.

1:40:50.176 --> 1:40:53.346
But why? Those kids can't run
a massive global corporation?

1:40:53.478 --> 1:40:55.914
You just left one of the biggest
businesses in the country

1:40:56.048 --> 1:40:58.284
to a handful
of drugged out hooligans.

1:40:58.417 --> 1:40:59.751
Exactly.

1:41:03.155 --> 1:41:05.690
Uhm, okay.

1:41:07.026 --> 1:41:08.760
You know how to fly this thing?

1:41:09.661 --> 1:41:10.963
You can't ask that question now.

1:41:11.397 --> 1:41:12.965
You should have asked
before we got on the jet

1:41:13.099 --> 1:41:14.632
and you put your seatbelt on.

1:41:17.669 --> 1:41:18.903
Well, what's the answer?

1:41:24.776 --> 1:41:26.878
Aren't you supposed
to pull up or something?

1:41:27.013 --> 1:41:29.547
Aren't you supposed
to pull up or something?

1:41:29.681 --> 1:41:32.184
Aren't you supposed
to pull up or something?

1:41:38.024 --> 1:41:39.557
We intend to honor
her last wishes

1:41:39.691 --> 1:41:42.927
and we will do our best to run
her family's corporations.

1:41:44.230 --> 1:41:45.764
With sorrow,

1:41:47.599 --> 1:41:49.135
we embrace our new fortunes.

1:42:25.071 --> 1:42:27.605
<i>This game is called...</i>

1:42:27.739 --> 1:42:33.212
<i>Atcha, atcha, atcha...</i>
