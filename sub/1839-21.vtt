19:30.367 --> 19:33.734
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE NOT
BLAMING YOURSELF FOR WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT, ARE YOU?

19:33.734 --> 19:37.934
I HAD TO GO AND GRAB
THAT WEDDING PICTURE
AND SING THAT STUPID SONG.

19:37.934 --> 19:39.700
EDDIE, LISTEN.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

19:39.700 --> 19:41.500
THAT YOUR PARENTS AREN'T
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

19:41.500 --> 19:45.300
CHELS, FOR ALL I KNOW,
IT'S MY FAULT WHY THEY
BROKE UP IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.200
NO. HOW CAN
YOU SAY THAT?

19:46.200 --> 19:49.667
THEY WERE DOING JUST FINE
TILL I CAME ALONG.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.100
WAIT A MINUTE, OK?

19:51.100 --> 19:53.767
YOUR PARENTS DID NOT
BREAK UP BECAUSE OF YOU.

19:53.767 --> 19:58.467
LOOK, RAE,
I KNOW IN MY MIND
THAT THAT'S THE TRUTH.

19:58.467 --> 20:01.300
BUT IN MY HEART...

20:01.567 --> 20:06.400
IT JUST STILL HURTS
NOT BEING ABLE
TO HAVE A FAMILY AGAIN.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.767
LISTEN, EDDIE.
I KNOW IT HURTS. OK?

20:09.767 --> 20:13.400
BUT NO PERSON CAN MAKE
2 PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.000
YEAH. EXCEPT FOR THAT
LITTLE GUY IN THE DIAPERS

20:17.000 --> 20:19.600
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.500
CUPID?

20:21.500 --> 20:24.200
NO. COUSIN EARL.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.734
UH, MAYBE WE BETTER GET
BACK TO THE PARTY.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.400
YOU SURE?

20:34.400 --> 20:37.133
MY FAMILY MAY NOT
BE TOGETHER,

20:37.133 --> 20:39.567
BUT AT LEAST THEY
ARE GETTING ALONG.

20:39.567 --> 20:41.600
SEE, THAT'S GOT
TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.300
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
MAKES ME FEEL GOOD?

20:43.300 --> 20:44.000
WHAT?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.400
KNOWING THAT YOU TWO
ARE ALWAYS GONNA
BE THERE FOR ME.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.500
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.
WE SURE WILL.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.200
LOOK WHO WE FOUND.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.300
EDDIE, ARE YOU OK?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.100
YES, MOM.
I'M SORRY I LEFT.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.867
I MUST HAVE MISSED
MY OWN PARTY.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.367
HEY, WE'RE JUST GLAD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

21:10.367 --> 21:13.033
YEAH.
HAVE A SEAT, SON.

21:14.367 --> 21:17.000
I JUST HAD TO THINK
A FEW THINGS OVER.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.667
BUT I'M COOL NOW.

21:18.667 --> 21:21.400
THERE'S ONE THING
WE WANT YOU TO KNOW.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.100
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

21:23.100 --> 21:25.834
YOUR MOTHER AND I
BOTH LOVE YOU,

21:25.834 --> 21:27.200
AND WE ALWAYS WILL.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.600
AND WE TALKED
THINGS OVER,

21:29.600 --> 21:30.300
AND WE BOTH AGREED

21:30.300 --> 21:34.500
THAT WE WILL ALWAYS CELEBRATE
YOUR BIRTHDAY TOGETHER.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.400
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.800
HEY! ANYBODY GOT CHANGE
FOR A QUARTER?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.200
OH, I MIGHT.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.834
CHELSEA, THERE IS
NOTHING IN YOUR--

21:53.500 --> 21:56.567
THAT EXPLAINS SO MUCH.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.000
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.300
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
