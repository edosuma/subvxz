01:06.055 --> 01:07.647
Cops!

01:11.493 --> 01:12.926
Cops!

01:12.995 --> 01:16.453
Julie Barnes. Runaway.
An addict at 18. A fighter.

01:16.532 --> 01:19.296
This little girl
was as hard as they come.

01:32.614 --> 01:36.414
Pete Cochran. A lost cause.
The world's biggest screwup.

01:36.485 --> 01:39.113
He went straight from Beverly Hills
to county jail.

01:57.506 --> 02:00.839
Lincoln Hayes. He doesn't blame
his crimes on anything.

02:00.909 --> 02:03.571
Had reasons all his own
to burn the world down.

02:13.989 --> 02:15.388
Easy, man!

02:15.457 --> 02:17.618
Your mother and I have been
worried sick, little girl.

02:17.693 --> 02:20.093
You gonna have to give it up
to Daddy, now. Come on.

02:20.162 --> 02:21.595
Hey! Stop!

02:23.699 --> 02:26.429
Take this police brutality, baby!

02:26.502 --> 02:28.265
Out of my way!

02:33.208 --> 02:36.075
All right, I'm gettin' out of here!
Dude, relax.

02:36.145 --> 02:40.104
Get those skinny leather pants
out of here!

02:40.182 --> 02:45.142
Go! You little shit.
You're gonna get caught.

02:50.626 --> 02:52.924
Easy, baby. Why the hackles?

03:14.149 --> 03:15.844
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

03:15.918 --> 03:18.011
Yeah? Can you hear me?

03:18.086 --> 03:19.678
Okay.

03:21.957 --> 03:25.017
They could've been anybody,
no better or worse than the rest.

03:25.093 --> 03:29.462
Heading for nowhere.
Until I gave them one last chance.

03:48.183 --> 03:50.117
- I'm gonna kill those kids.
- They're mine.

03:50.185 --> 03:53.916
- If anybody does, it's me.
- They're screwing with my men.

03:53.989 --> 03:57.049
- Is there a problem, fellas?
- No.

03:57.125 --> 03:59.855
- Workin' late again tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

03:59.928 --> 04:03.557
Every night, until we find out who stole
those drugs from the evidence locker.

04:07.369 --> 04:10.270
- IA.
- They were just doing their job.

04:10.339 --> 04:12.500
Hello, Los Angeles!

04:12.574 --> 04:15.702
- Adam...
- They didn't volunteer for this job.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.267
- It was my idea.
- They're punks.

04:17.346 --> 04:19.814
- We're supposed to give them a chance.
- Come on!

04:19.880 --> 04:22.645
You're gonna side with them?
They're not real cops!

04:22.718 --> 04:24.948
They can't even carry guns,
for God's sakes.

04:25.020 --> 04:28.285
Maybe you should spend a little more
time worrying about your own guys...

04:28.357 --> 04:30.335
- and a little less time...
- What's that supposed to mean?

04:30.359 --> 04:34.090
Nothing. These kids can get into
a thousand places that we can't.

04:36.531 --> 04:41.127
You three really screwed up tonight.
Get your feet off that table. Get up!

04:41.203 --> 04:44.297
What are you talking about, man?
We got the job done.

04:44.373 --> 04:47.934
- Yeah, we set the bad guys up, right?
- Why don't you shut up and listen.

04:48.010 --> 04:50.088
You should be yelling at the cops
for beating up kids.

04:50.112 --> 04:52.239
You smacked Detective Tricky
in the mouth.

04:57.119 --> 05:00.953
Do you think this is a joke?
You little numb-nut.

05:01.023 --> 05:03.753
Okay, Bob, I'll take care of this.
Let me take care of this.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.486
- Yeah, Bob!
- Hey!

05:06.995 --> 05:09.361
Sit down and shut up. Sit!

05:11.667 --> 05:13.635
You think this is a joke?

05:13.702 --> 05:17.297
If you think it's a joke, I'll stick you
right back into the cells...

05:17.372 --> 05:19.499
where I found you.

05:19.574 --> 05:22.236
You're policemen now.
Stop screwing around...

05:22.311 --> 05:24.404
and start doing your job.

05:24.479 --> 05:26.879
If you're gonna start overacting
like circus freaks...

05:26.948 --> 05:30.076
you might as well be wearin' badges,
for crying out loud!

05:30.152 --> 05:31.779
Are we done yet?

05:31.853 --> 05:34.822
- Excuse me?
- Are we done?

05:34.890 --> 05:36.983
You're done when I say we're done.

05:37.059 --> 05:39.337
- Is that Harry? It looks like him.
- All right, everybody.

05:39.361 --> 05:42.421
- Listen up.
- Save it for the kiddies, Greer.

05:46.268 --> 05:48.202
That's pretty funny.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.433
All right, tough guy.

05:53.508 --> 05:56.875
If you or anybody else
has got a problem with my squad...

05:56.945 --> 05:59.436
you gotta go through me first.

05:59.514 --> 06:00.947
Any takers?

06:44.326 --> 06:48.126
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

06:48.196 --> 06:50.221
Thanks for asking.

06:50.298 --> 06:52.377
Eckford and Lanier aren't here.
I got something to do.

06:52.401 --> 06:54.335
We'll get started without them.
Follow me.

06:56.571 --> 06:58.505
You guys see that club down there?

07:00.575 --> 07:04.534
We have reason to believe there's
a black book operation goin' on inside.

07:04.613 --> 07:08.242
- What's black book?
- Hookers. Expensive ones.

07:08.316 --> 07:11.843
Young girls. We also think
the manager, Red Wilson, is involved.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.583
Julie, you go inside undercover as
a waitress and hopefully get recruited.

07:15.657 --> 07:18.455
Why does she always get to be
the prostitute?

07:18.527 --> 07:21.223
You two will go inside,
split up, blend...

07:21.296 --> 07:24.356
work the room and keep your eye
on this Red character.

07:26.935 --> 07:29.165
All right, listen to me.

07:29.237 --> 07:31.262
Be nice to these guys.

07:31.339 --> 07:35.366
They've been on this case for a while.
They're not gonna like working with you.

07:35.444 --> 07:37.435
Do what they tell you to
and remember to...

07:37.512 --> 07:40.242
- Keep our noses clean?
- Exactly.

07:40.315 --> 07:43.375
- Sorry we're late, Adam.
- Yeah, sorry we're late.

07:43.452 --> 07:46.546
- Hey, no excuses, partner.
- You're not my partner.

07:47.923 --> 07:49.914
We went over the assignments
and the background.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.551
You guys work out the logistics
amongst yourselves.

07:58.733 --> 08:00.667
Which one's Eckford
and which one's Lanier?

08:00.735 --> 08:03.670
Save it. This is our case.

08:03.738 --> 08:06.036
We don't want you little pussies
playing cop inside.

08:06.107 --> 08:08.337
Making our J-O-B
all that much harder.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.901
You dig?

08:12.881 --> 08:14.815
She comes in. Yeah.

08:16.284 --> 08:18.218
There you go, little girl.

08:18.286 --> 08:21.483
Two grams, asshole.

08:21.556 --> 08:25.185
- Call a cop.
- Fuck you, pig!

08:33.534 --> 08:35.001
Are you okay?

08:35.070 --> 08:40.269
- Yeah.
- You wanna come back inside?

09:17.245 --> 09:18.872
Excuse me.

09:18.947 --> 09:21.939
- Listen, I gotta meet up with Greer.
- What, now?

09:22.017 --> 09:24.178
Yeah, you know how the man is
about punctuality.

09:24.252 --> 09:26.277
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:26.354 --> 09:29.915
- Keep an eye out for Julie, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.333
Hey! How's it goin', girl?

09:47.542 --> 09:49.874
You wanna come up to my office
after your shift?

09:49.945 --> 09:52.413
I've been meaning to ask you
if I can work some extra hours.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.812
- I can really use the cash.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:54.883 --> 09:59.217
Well, I, you know...
We'll see what we can do. Huh?

10:13.435 --> 10:15.733
You mind if I cut in?

10:17.939 --> 10:19.065
Hey, there.

10:23.945 --> 10:25.572
How you been? Long time.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.706
Yeah.

10:33.021 --> 10:36.582
God, what's it been,
like three years?

10:36.658 --> 10:41.618
I never thought I'd see you again.
You look really great, you know?

10:46.067 --> 10:48.558
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah.

10:48.637 --> 10:51.663
Can I get a club soda
with a lemon?

10:53.274 --> 10:54.571
Really?

10:54.643 --> 10:56.406
I have two years in July.

10:58.079 --> 11:00.343
Right on.
Year and a half last month.

11:00.415 --> 11:03.316
Really? That's great.

11:07.222 --> 11:09.486
You been doin' this long or what?

11:12.460 --> 11:14.951
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

11:15.030 --> 11:17.931
I haven't seen that smile
in a long time.

11:21.403 --> 11:24.702
So, I guess I should let you
get back to work.

11:27.809 --> 11:29.299
Yeah.

11:32.881 --> 11:36.112
Hey, listen.
Can I see you again?

11:38.253 --> 11:39.311
Okay.

11:40.455 --> 11:41.513
Okay, then?

12:17.892 --> 12:19.826
Oh, my God!

12:24.799 --> 12:27.063
- Tiffany!
- Uh-oh.

12:28.937 --> 12:30.666
What "uh-oh"?

12:39.314 --> 12:41.373
Okay, wait, wait.

12:48.690 --> 12:50.385
Get up!

12:52.594 --> 12:54.755
Get the hell out of here!

13:04.706 --> 13:07.834
I saw Greer roll up on this cat
with leather pants.

13:07.909 --> 13:09.240
What?

13:09.310 --> 13:13.440
The dude from the bust.
I saw Greer pick him up.

13:15.350 --> 13:18.251
It was the same guy
I saw at the bust last week.

13:18.319 --> 13:23.416
- A cop was helping him get away.
- Are you sure it was Greer?

13:24.859 --> 13:28.260
- Looked like his car.
- Every car looks like his car.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.263
That's the point of the car.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.891
Dude, you're paranoid.

13:32.967 --> 13:35.435
Nice job!

13:35.503 --> 13:39.269
Okay, I really did not
like that at all, all right?

13:39.340 --> 13:42.241
Let me just explain somethin'.
I was blending.

13:42.310 --> 13:45.245
You just blended your ass
right out of the club, man.

13:45.313 --> 13:48.908
Oh, come on! They're gonna
let me back in the club.

13:48.983 --> 13:52.146
I believe the words were
"you're gone for-fucking-ever."

13:52.220 --> 13:55.519
- Greer's gonna kick your ass.
- You know what? Eat me.

13:55.590 --> 13:58.150
Come on. Let's go.
You wanna lose another fight, Petey?

13:58.226 --> 14:01.024
Who was the guy that
you were talkin' to all night?

14:01.095 --> 14:03.461
- What guy?
- Yeah, "what guy."

14:03.531 --> 14:05.123
A suspect?

14:05.200 --> 14:08.363
What? No. I don't even know
what he's talkin' about.

14:08.436 --> 14:12.304
How could you see anything? You had your
head buried in a pair of tits all night.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.865
I could see things because
I got eyes behind my head, all right?

14:15.944 --> 14:19.243
- Julie's got a boyfriend
- Please grow up.

14:19.314 --> 14:22.442
Let's all together, in harmony.

14:22.517 --> 14:26.817
Hey, mommy! Where you goin'
with that fine little ass, baby?

14:26.888 --> 14:30.346
Why don't you get out in the street
and earn a real living, huh?

14:30.425 --> 14:32.290
- What?
- She digs me.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.727
- You have your hall pass, young lady?
- You wanna see my hall pass?

14:35.797 --> 14:38.288
Yeah, and then I wanna see you
in detention.

14:38.366 --> 14:41.460
Why do you have to be such a pussy?
Leave her alone.

14:41.536 --> 14:43.731
Who you callin' a pussy, pussy?

14:43.805 --> 14:47.468
- Motherfucker.
- Oh, God, you terrify me.

14:47.542 --> 14:51.706
- Tricky, just back off, man.
- Get outta my face, boy.

14:51.779 --> 14:54.111
- What?
- Let's go. In my office.

14:54.182 --> 14:56.116
Move your ass.

14:56.184 --> 14:58.516
In my office. Move your ass!

15:10.498 --> 15:12.989
- Where were you last night?
- Excuse me?

15:13.067 --> 15:15.535
You left me out on the street
for, like, an hour.

15:15.603 --> 15:17.798
I was doin' something.

15:17.872 --> 15:20.864
I'd love to know what you were doin'
while I was out there waitin'.

15:20.942 --> 15:23.103
- It's a police matter.
- What's a police matter?

15:23.177 --> 15:25.322
- Shut your face.
- Why don't you try stealin' drugs...

15:25.346 --> 15:28.213
- from the evidence locker?
- What? What'd you say?

15:28.283 --> 15:29.944
Stealin' drugs
from the evidence locker.

15:30.018 --> 15:32.509
You better watch what you say
and who you're saying it to.

15:32.587 --> 15:34.919
- Let me tell you something, Linc.
- Save it.

15:34.989 --> 15:37.082
Shut up and listen to me.

15:37.158 --> 15:40.457
One of these days, you'll wake up
and be 30. Who knows? Maybe even 40.

15:40.528 --> 15:43.258
Get up when I talk to you.
Get up.

15:44.666 --> 15:47.191
And you're gonna be alone,
all alone.

15:47.268 --> 15:50.465
You're gonna realize not everybody
in this world is your enemy.

15:50.538 --> 15:55.908
I'm trying to do my job. I suggest you
do the same and quit breaking my balls.

15:58.913 --> 16:01.040
It's enough already.

16:03.618 --> 16:06.485
Get off my desk, please.

16:06.554 --> 16:10.115
- Is there any luck at the club?
- Look, Captain.

16:10.191 --> 16:14.855
We're just trying to get
really, really deep undercover.

16:14.929 --> 16:15.953
Yeah.

16:17.565 --> 16:19.897
- The manager's a real creep.
- Yeah? And?

16:19.968 --> 16:22.368
It feels like there's definitely
something going on in there.

16:22.403 --> 16:26.430
I don't care about feelings. This isn't
a feelings business. Get some evidence.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.237
You're on the roof
with Eckford and Lanier.

16:31.546 --> 16:35.414
Take off those stupid sunglasses
and do what you're told.

16:35.483 --> 16:37.178
Yes, sir.

16:37.251 --> 16:40.414
There are people breathing down my neck
to get rid of all three of you.

16:40.488 --> 16:43.013
- What'd we do?
- Arson, assault and robbery.

16:43.091 --> 16:47.187
Now, get out. And remember, I'm the only
thing keeping you clowns out of prison.

16:47.261 --> 16:50.788
- Man, this job sucks!
- Beats jail.

16:50.865 --> 16:52.799
A deal's a deal.

17:10.518 --> 17:12.383
- What the hell?
- Dude, they're not there.

17:12.453 --> 17:16.549
- What are you doin' in here?
- Eckford and Lanier.

17:17.759 --> 17:18.817
What?

17:18.893 --> 17:21.726
They never showed.
Give me the keys.

17:23.498 --> 17:27.491
- The keys to what?
- I got no car. This is a stakeout.

17:30.004 --> 17:32.165
- Are you crazy? Hell no.
- Come on!

17:32.240 --> 17:36.540
This is a cop thing. You can't just
leave me standing there like an asshole.

17:36.611 --> 17:40.741
- I swear to God, man. One scratch...
- All right.

18:09.043 --> 18:13.036
- What can I get you, slick?
- I'll take a malt liquor, sister.

18:13.114 --> 18:16.311
I need you to find out everything
you can about this guy over there...

18:16.384 --> 18:19.376
with the blonde hair
and leather pants in the booth.

18:20.521 --> 18:22.113
Is he your guy?

18:22.857 --> 18:24.085
Yeah.

18:25.126 --> 18:27.060
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

18:48.783 --> 18:51.775
- What?
- It's so freaky to see you again.

18:51.853 --> 18:53.377
- Freaky?
- Yeah.

18:53.454 --> 18:57.151
- Maybe it's just the hair. I don't know.
- My hair?

19:00.194 --> 19:02.594
I wanna say that I'm sorry
about what happened before.

19:02.663 --> 19:06.121
About not calling
and disappearing like that.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.192
- I was an asshole.
- Forget it. It was a long time ago.

19:09.270 --> 19:11.750
- We were both really fucked up.
- Yeah, I know, but I'm sorry.

19:11.806 --> 19:15.572
- I'm sorry that I hurt you.
- Forgiven. It's over. We're movin' on.

19:17.278 --> 19:21.840
What are you doin' in this place
other than keeping me from my job?

19:21.916 --> 19:23.281
Take a break?

19:23.351 --> 19:25.581
Now?

19:25.653 --> 19:27.746
- Just to talk.
- Yeah.

19:36.164 --> 19:38.792
You can page me
if you need to talk to me.

19:38.866 --> 19:40.959
See ya!

19:41.035 --> 19:44.596
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Let's go. You can do this later.

19:48.910 --> 19:50.377
How are you doin'?

19:51.579 --> 19:55.242
- I'm all right.
- Are you here with someone?

19:55.316 --> 19:58.683
- No.
- Would you like to be?

20:00.588 --> 20:02.522
Maybe later. I gotta go.

20:08.396 --> 20:11.092
Not really goin' for
waitress of the month, are you?

20:11.165 --> 20:13.531
Apparently not. I missed you.

20:21.209 --> 20:23.143
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

20:24.612 --> 20:26.705
Whoa, whoa.
I thought we were just gonna talk.

20:26.781 --> 20:28.806
Oh, please.

20:31.652 --> 20:33.552
Hey, my man!

21:00.014 --> 21:02.847
Okay, give me the keys.
Give me the keys!

21:02.917 --> 21:05.249
Gilbert, no, man.
I'm giving you a ride. That's enough.

21:05.319 --> 21:07.253
Give me the keys.

21:09.156 --> 21:11.249
- Be careful.
- Always.

21:11.325 --> 21:13.190
- Pop the trunk.
- Why?

21:13.261 --> 21:17.357
Because it's cold and buggin'.
I want my jacket. Okay, Gilbert?

21:33.614 --> 21:36.139
Put on your jacket and let's go!

21:36.217 --> 21:38.310
- Ah, man!
- "Ah, man" what?

21:38.386 --> 21:40.251
- Hey.
- Cops!

21:40.321 --> 21:43.381
Cops? Shit!

21:43.457 --> 21:44.719
Get the car!

21:59.040 --> 22:00.405
Shit!

22:00.474 --> 22:02.408
Shit, shit, shit!

22:16.123 --> 22:17.613
Come on, man!

22:44.685 --> 22:45.685
Sorry!

23:55.790 --> 23:57.223
Who's your friend?

23:57.291 --> 24:01.125
Look, man, I was just giving him
a lift, man. That's all.

24:01.195 --> 24:02.287
Where?

24:02.363 --> 24:05.025
Just under the Sixth St. bridge.
That was all.

24:05.099 --> 24:07.397
I was just gonna take him
under the Sixth St. bridge!

24:07.468 --> 24:09.402
His name's Gilbert O'Reilly.

24:09.470 --> 24:13.167
I told him I'd give him a ride.
I was, like, designated driver.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.299
You know, like a car pool.

24:15.376 --> 24:18.140
I'll take you to where he lives.
Okay, you want a car wash?

24:18.212 --> 24:21.579
I work at the Valley Car Wash.
I'll give you a free car wash...

24:21.649 --> 24:23.913
on the...

24:34.228 --> 24:36.696
Julie, someone said
they saw you come in here.

24:36.764 --> 24:39.892
- What?
- What are you doing in here?

24:39.967 --> 24:42.162
What do you think I'm doing, Red?

24:46.006 --> 24:50.670
I've been lookin' for you all night.
You're not supposed to be in the VIP.

24:50.744 --> 24:54.339
Finish up and get your ass
back down to work.

25:03.390 --> 25:04.789
Oh, my God.

25:05.793 --> 25:08.318
- I guess I should get back to work.
- Oh, really?

25:08.395 --> 25:10.522
Yeah. You can stay up here,
if you want.

25:10.598 --> 25:13.328
- You know what? I have to go.
- Oh, okay.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.927
- I have to go to this club.
- That's cool.

25:17.004 --> 25:20.770
Look. Here's my number.
You call me. I mean it.

25:20.841 --> 25:24.743
Whenever you need anything,
anytime, please.

25:28.449 --> 25:32.351
- Okay?
- It's nice talking to you.

25:32.419 --> 25:34.444
It's nice talking to you too.

25:36.156 --> 25:37.885
- See you.
- See you.

25:42.496 --> 25:44.487
Oh, God.

25:48.269 --> 25:50.703
Linc, I can't believe it, man.

25:50.771 --> 25:52.705
I mean, I can't...

25:52.773 --> 25:56.072
I mean, I can't believe it, man.

25:57.611 --> 25:59.010
Dude...

26:00.180 --> 26:03.946
If people could learn
to drive in this city!

26:08.322 --> 26:12.019
I'm gonna call my lawyer friend,
all right? No, no, no.

26:12.092 --> 26:14.083
Where you goin'?

26:14.161 --> 26:16.288
I gotta tell Jules we're goin'.

26:16.363 --> 26:18.695
What about that guy?

26:18.766 --> 26:22.361
I caught the guy.
He talked, and I let him go.

26:23.571 --> 26:25.163
All right.

26:41.422 --> 26:43.356
You sure about this, Linc?

26:43.424 --> 26:46.484
Look, the dude said the guys
are meeting a cop under this bridge.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.427
Greer's got nothin'
to do with drugs, man.

26:49.496 --> 26:51.896
He helped me get sober, you know?

26:58.606 --> 27:01.336
Could you have parked
further away?

27:01.408 --> 27:03.933
- Precautions, man.
- Paranoid, man.

27:47.788 --> 27:49.688
Oh, my God.

27:49.757 --> 27:52.089
It's Greer.

27:53.794 --> 27:55.159
Oh, man.

28:02.302 --> 28:04.293
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

28:05.906 --> 28:09.501
I mean, I can't believe it.

28:17.384 --> 28:19.318
Is that cocaine?

28:33.300 --> 28:35.234
So, what do we do?

28:35.302 --> 28:37.964
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

28:38.038 --> 28:40.370
I'm not gonna just leave him here.

28:40.441 --> 28:42.875
What are you talkin' about?
Let's go.

28:42.943 --> 28:46.777
Wait, wait, wait.
We're cops, all right?

28:46.847 --> 28:49.839
We're on the scene.
This is our job. All right?

28:49.917 --> 28:52.351
We're not that kind of cops, man.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.382
We gotta go now! Come on!

29:29.056 --> 29:30.990
You all right?

29:34.561 --> 29:36.654
I can't believe he's dead.

29:39.233 --> 29:43.533
They're gonna think we were in on it.
They're gonna come for us.

29:43.604 --> 29:46.129
Why would they come for us?

29:47.808 --> 29:50.936
Because we're in the clubs, Pete.
We're his kids.

29:52.279 --> 29:54.713
Greer wasn't like that.
It was a setup.

29:58.619 --> 30:00.610
All right, look.

30:00.687 --> 30:03.884
You were sick. We were giving you a lift
home. That's why we left the club.

30:03.957 --> 30:05.322
Okay? All right?

30:05.392 --> 30:06.723
Okay.

30:11.632 --> 30:13.998
Show time.

30:30.117 --> 30:33.644
I'm Detective Briggs, Internal Affairs.
I just got a few questions for you.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.153
Okay.

30:35.222 --> 30:38.521
- Tell me where you were tonight.
- I don't know.

30:38.592 --> 30:40.753
We sent a car over to the club.

30:40.828 --> 30:43.023
- None of you were there.
- Julie was sick.

30:43.096 --> 30:45.587
- How are you doing, Julie?
- I'm all right.

30:45.666 --> 30:47.691
- What was wrong?
- I don't know.

30:47.768 --> 30:50.464
Do I look like a doctor?
I said she wasn't feeling well.

30:50.537 --> 30:54.098
No, I was in the...
I was in the bar.

30:54.174 --> 30:56.335
- No work tonight?
- I had an upset stomach...

30:56.410 --> 30:59.004
so I left work early,
and Pete and Linc drove me home.

30:59.079 --> 31:02.207
No, no, no.
I was outside the bar.

31:02.282 --> 31:05.342
You guys must be gettin'
pretty tight.

31:05.419 --> 31:08.320
- Not really.
- Not really?

31:08.388 --> 31:11.619
Julie got sick in the bar,
and I had to take her home.

31:11.692 --> 31:16.129
I went in the bar to get Linc,
'cause I can't drive Linc's...

31:16.196 --> 31:19.654
- So you just took off?
- Eckford and Lanier, they left too.

31:19.733 --> 31:22.566
- Where were Eckford and Lanier?
- I don't know.

31:25.038 --> 31:28.633
- Ask me a question. Anything you want.
- Where were you when Greer got shot?

31:28.709 --> 31:30.006
What?

31:30.077 --> 31:32.511
- Greer's dead?
- Sorry.

31:32.579 --> 31:37.573
Two shots to the chest.
It looked like something exploded.

31:37.651 --> 31:40.984
You know what you're doin'? You're
tryin' to play on my emotions right now.

31:41.054 --> 31:45.013
That's what you're tryin' to do.
I know this whole game.

31:45.092 --> 31:47.219
I know...

31:47.294 --> 31:51.060
- What do you know?
- I don't know anything.

31:51.131 --> 31:53.599
Except that we found drugs
on the scene.

31:53.667 --> 31:56.329
Cocaine. We're running tests.

31:56.403 --> 31:59.861
We think it may be the stuff
from the evidence locker.

31:59.940 --> 32:02.875
You look a little nervous, Pete.
Something you wanna tell me?

32:02.943 --> 32:06.777
- You know anything about drugs, Julie?
- Enough to stay away.

32:06.847 --> 32:08.610
Do I need to call a lawyer?

32:13.186 --> 32:16.587
Not yet. But we may need you
for additional questioning...

32:16.657 --> 32:19.023
so don't go anywhere.

32:24.665 --> 32:28.726
- Were you crying?
- No!

32:28.802 --> 32:30.895
How are you holding up?

32:30.971 --> 32:33.769
We're fine.

32:33.840 --> 32:37.139
Well, they're suspending the unit,
pending further investigation.

32:45.485 --> 32:48.386
- What did Briggs tell you?
- Nothin'.

32:48.455 --> 32:52.551
Our captain's dead, they don't know what
happened and they found drugs on him.

32:52.626 --> 32:54.560
They think they're from
the evidence locker.

32:54.628 --> 32:56.562
Every man's gotta
make a living, right?

32:56.630 --> 32:59.064
Shut up.

32:59.132 --> 33:01.600
You didn't even know him.
He was a great cop. Shut up!

33:08.375 --> 33:10.343
A little too much coffee.

33:11.712 --> 33:14.010
Oh, baby.

33:20.253 --> 33:21.914
Look, um...

33:21.989 --> 33:24.685
I'm gonna do what I can
to get you back on.

33:24.758 --> 33:28.285
And I'm gonna do it because
it's what Adam Greer would've wanted.

33:28.362 --> 33:30.762
But you're gonna have
to lay low...

33:30.831 --> 33:33.925
for a while, so...

33:34.001 --> 33:37.664
I can't believe I'm doin' this.

33:37.738 --> 33:41.037
This is my address
and home phone.

33:43.243 --> 33:45.370
If you need anything.

33:46.947 --> 33:48.346
Thanks.

33:53.687 --> 33:55.621
He was my friend.

33:58.658 --> 34:00.592
Since when's he so friendly?

34:02.229 --> 34:05.858
- Since maybe his best friend just died.
- So what.

34:05.932 --> 34:07.832
So what?

34:09.569 --> 34:12.969
- You're an asshole. Greer was...
- Greer was what?

34:13.040 --> 34:16.407
You're actin' like this guy was
your best friend. He wasn't your daddy.

34:20.847 --> 34:24.476
Fuck you! You guys wanna play like this
doesn't matter, like you don't care?

34:27.087 --> 34:28.485
Fine, I'm out.

35:30.951 --> 35:33.385
This is Billy. Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

35:50.237 --> 35:53.001
You ready to get
to the bottom of this?

35:55.642 --> 35:57.576
What do you mean?

35:57.644 --> 36:00.909
Well, for starters, we gotta
find that guy with the leather pants.

36:01.915 --> 36:04.611
So, what... How do you think
we're gonna do that?

36:05.919 --> 36:08.786
I know a friend of his.

36:17.497 --> 36:20.022
- For me?
- Is what for you?

36:20.100 --> 36:23.001
- The fish?
- For you.

36:23.069 --> 36:24.696
Thank you.

36:24.771 --> 36:26.534
Can I come in?

36:26.606 --> 36:28.540
Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course.

36:28.608 --> 36:32.271
- Your address was listed, so...
- I'm so proud to have one.

36:34.848 --> 36:38.807
You sounded so depressed on the message.
I thought I'd come by and cheer you up.

36:38.885 --> 36:40.750
Thank you.

36:43.690 --> 36:45.851
God, I must look like shit.
I've been asleep all day.

36:45.926 --> 36:48.986
- That's not possible.
- Yeah, actually.

36:54.334 --> 36:57.360
- I'm sorry. Whoops.
- It's all right. It's okay.

36:59.673 --> 37:02.107
That the perp's place, bro?

37:02.175 --> 37:05.008
- Yeah.
- Stop, bro.

37:05.078 --> 37:09.208
- Stop, stop.
- What?

37:09.282 --> 37:11.978
I think I should drive in
and make the collar.

37:12.052 --> 37:15.021
Are you crazy? Man, you're lucky
I let you ride in the car.

37:15.088 --> 37:17.818
Dude, the guy knows
what you look like, all right?

37:17.891 --> 37:19.256
So?

37:20.427 --> 37:22.361
Dude, your cover's been blown,
all right?

37:22.429 --> 37:26.661
Your cover's been blown.
Your cover has been blown. All right?

37:27.968 --> 37:30.232
I gotta do it. That's it.

37:31.471 --> 37:34.736
Dude, I'm gonna go in there
and I'm gonna bring him out.

37:36.776 --> 37:40.041
Bro, I'm still under. I got it.

38:36.703 --> 38:38.295
Oh, shit!

38:38.371 --> 38:40.635
Shit! Shit!

38:43.009 --> 38:44.909
Stop! Police!

39:08.268 --> 39:10.634
Hey! Somebody grab that guy!

39:13.940 --> 39:15.339
Grab that guy!

39:35.962 --> 39:37.452
Goddamn it!

39:37.530 --> 39:40.863
Look, I told you, man,
that's not even my stuff, okay?

39:40.934 --> 39:42.959
It's some... What?

39:43.036 --> 39:46.631
I was just giving Gilbert a ride
to meet some cop.

39:46.706 --> 39:50.802
It was just a car pool situation.
That's not a crime. Just savin' gas.

39:58.318 --> 40:01.378
Dude, I'm sorry about the car.
He was gettin' away.

40:01.454 --> 40:03.388
I mean, what do you
want me to do?

40:05.625 --> 40:09.152
- Dude, it's just water.
- Save it!

40:09.229 --> 40:11.789
Look, where's leather pants live?

40:11.865 --> 40:13.890
- Who?
- Gilbert O'Reilly.

40:13.967 --> 40:16.162
Look, are you guys really cops?

40:16.236 --> 40:19.364
- 'Cause my boss is just...
- Dude, we're undercover.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.103
Really? What'd he do, anyway?

40:24.177 --> 40:26.907
Dude, we think he killed
our boss, all right?

40:26.980 --> 40:29.346
Would you shut up?

40:29.416 --> 40:31.884
Yeah, shut up, man!

40:33.820 --> 40:37.449
- You keep tickling me.
- Hold still! I gotta concentrate.

40:37.524 --> 40:39.082
Come on!

40:39.159 --> 40:41.787
- You're being... What're you doin'?
- I gotta go.

40:41.861 --> 40:44.557
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I gotta go.

40:45.298 --> 40:46.731
Why?

40:47.834 --> 40:49.859
I gotta go meet my sponsor.

40:54.607 --> 40:56.632
You're gonna wear my lipstick?

41:01.648 --> 41:04.412
This is my address, okay?

41:07.654 --> 41:10.953
And next week,
I'm gonna cook you dinner.

41:11.024 --> 41:14.152
Since when do you know
how to cook?

41:14.227 --> 41:16.161
I have a week. I'll learn.

41:18.898 --> 41:20.832
- See you.
- See you.

41:45.425 --> 41:47.950
- Watch the car.
- Sorry, man.

41:51.764 --> 41:54.130
- Sure he lives here?
- Yeah.

41:54.200 --> 41:58.660
You know, he's a surfer guy,
so he likes to be near the water.

41:58.738 --> 42:00.330
Knock?

42:06.379 --> 42:09.246
I don't think he's home.

42:09.315 --> 42:11.647
Stand back. Stand back!

42:11.718 --> 42:15.381
Oh, shit.
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

42:15.455 --> 42:17.616
- Bro, stand back.
- Where'd you get that from?

42:17.690 --> 42:20.056
Dude, it's my dad's.

42:20.126 --> 42:23.027
Oh, yeah.
You know how to use it?

42:23.096 --> 42:25.121
Bro, you just point and shoot.

42:25.198 --> 42:27.826
Look, just don't point
and shoot at me.

42:27.901 --> 42:30.961
You know what? No guns, okay?

42:31.037 --> 42:32.800
- Guns are bad.
- Shut up!

42:32.872 --> 42:35.363
- I know a guy once...
- Shut up!

42:37.677 --> 42:40.202
Do a perimeter search, all right?
Cover me.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.771
- With what?
- Cover me.

43:04.971 --> 43:06.905
Are you nuts?

43:09.576 --> 43:11.510
All right.

43:13.012 --> 43:14.946
What do we do now?

43:16.783 --> 43:20.776
- We wait.
- Cops wait.

44:18.711 --> 44:20.235
Hello?

44:20.313 --> 44:22.247
I think I have the wrong number.

44:33.026 --> 44:35.494
- Hello?
- Who's this?

44:35.561 --> 44:38.758
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

44:38.831 --> 44:41.231
I told you not to pick up
the fuckin' phone!

44:53.813 --> 44:55.405
Hello. Yellow Cab.

44:55.481 --> 44:57.949
Can I get a cab
over at Hollywood and Vine?

45:08.795 --> 45:10.729
- Pull over here.
- All right.

45:12.865 --> 45:14.457
Here you go.

45:20.640 --> 45:22.335
Well?

45:24.177 --> 45:26.737
- Hold on. Wait a second.
- All right.

45:43.362 --> 45:44.989
Follow that Caddie.

45:45.064 --> 45:46.588
You got it.

46:24.837 --> 46:26.964
- Here you go.
- Keep the change.

47:00.072 --> 47:02.131
Come on.
Do some business with me.

47:02.208 --> 47:04.233
Do you see I'm busy?

47:04.310 --> 47:06.288
- Leave me alone.
- It'll just take a couple minutes.

47:06.312 --> 47:11.750
I'll leave you alone as soon as we deal
with this in the back with some privacy.

47:11.818 --> 47:15.879
- You're driving me crazy.
- All right. Shut up!

47:15.955 --> 47:18.924
I love you, sweetheart.
You know, you're a pain in the ass.

47:18.991 --> 47:20.925
- Come on.
- You're a pain in the ass!

47:20.993 --> 47:24.258
Yeah, but you love me. I'm a pain
in the ass, but you love my ass.

47:46.819 --> 47:49.481
You're making me laugh.
You wanna make a big deal with me?

47:49.555 --> 47:51.489
I know you got something
goin' down...

47:51.557 --> 47:53.491
with one of your bands and drugs...

47:53.559 --> 47:56.392
You leave the fuckin' boys
outta this!

47:56.462 --> 47:58.396
- They can really rock and roll.
- What?

47:58.464 --> 48:01.627
This is a joke, right?
You are a pimp, Billy.

48:01.701 --> 48:04.966
A pimp. You do drugs.
That doesn't mean you should sell 'em.

48:05.037 --> 48:07.130
Just say no, man.

48:07.206 --> 48:10.972
Just tell me when and where it's goin'
down and I will bring the cash, okay?

48:11.043 --> 48:14.740
You wanna be a big shot?
You wanna make the big fuckin' deal?

48:14.814 --> 48:18.250
Okay, you're in. But you better not
mess with me or I'll crush your balls.

48:18.317 --> 48:21.980
- I would not mess with you.
- Or the band. They really got a future.

48:22.054 --> 48:25.046
- Okay, okay. Can I use your phone?
- Who are you gonna call?

48:25.124 --> 48:27.684
I'm gonna call the cops, Howard.

48:27.760 --> 48:30.228
Funny, very funny.
Keep it local.

48:38.037 --> 48:41.268
Bob? Hey. Yeah,
I just talked to him. Deal's set.

48:41.340 --> 48:46.334
You relax, Bob. None of them have
any idea that I know they're cops.

48:46.412 --> 48:49.609
Especially her. Look,
I'm her goddamn dream man, okay?

48:49.682 --> 48:53.243
No, you listen to me! If you wanna have
somebody else take a shot...

48:53.319 --> 48:55.753
like Tricky or one of
the other men in blue that...

48:57.590 --> 49:00.218
The what? All right.

49:00.293 --> 49:03.694
I gotta go. Something's come up.

49:03.763 --> 49:06.425
I gotta go. Bye.

49:07.967 --> 49:11.266
- Wow.
- Hi, baby.

49:11.337 --> 49:13.202
- Is this for me?
- Mm-hmm.

49:13.272 --> 49:15.297
Really? Come here.

49:51.577 --> 49:53.511
Dude, I think there's something
down there, bro.

49:53.579 --> 49:55.604
- What?
- I don't know. Wait!

49:55.681 --> 49:57.774
I hear some voices down there.

49:57.850 --> 50:01.183
- It's the ocean.
- Wait. No, listen.

50:02.488 --> 50:04.854
Get back in the car.

50:04.924 --> 50:08.655
Get back in the car.
No, I will shoot you.

50:08.728 --> 50:11.788
- Get back in the car.
- All right.

50:13.332 --> 50:15.800
Let's go.

50:31.017 --> 50:34.043
Be quiet, Gilbert. All right?

50:34.120 --> 50:36.020
Sit down!

50:39.925 --> 50:41.517
Bye, Gilbert.

51:09.822 --> 51:12.052
Man, I thought I told you, no guns.

51:27.473 --> 51:28.906
My ankle! Shit!

51:36.916 --> 51:38.713
Oh, Jesus. Who's this?

51:38.784 --> 51:40.718
- Beats me.
- Come on.

51:40.786 --> 51:43.220
Let's dump him in the trailer
with Gilbert.

52:04.777 --> 52:07.007
I gotta go.
I gotta get out of here.

52:07.079 --> 52:09.013
All right?

52:11.183 --> 52:13.674
- Where are you goin', man?
- I don't know, man.

52:13.752 --> 52:17.779
I just gotta go, all right?
What are you gonna do, hit me?

52:20.392 --> 52:24.260
- Yeah, right.
- Don't be stupid, Pete.

52:27.199 --> 52:29.394
You're callin' me stupid?

52:29.468 --> 52:34.667
I got a fucked up ankle.
I got brain and blood all over my body.

52:34.740 --> 52:38.267
And I'm fuckin' stupid.
You know what? Fuck you!

52:40.746 --> 52:44.079
You know what, man?
You wanna leave? Go ahead, my man.

52:44.150 --> 52:46.084
Matter of fact, take my keys.

52:46.152 --> 52:48.279
I don't give a shit.

54:36.695 --> 54:40.028
His head just exploded, like,
all over the place, all over everything.

54:40.099 --> 54:43.591
All over my clothes, my face,
all over...

54:43.669 --> 54:47.935
And then I dropped Linc off at home...

54:48.007 --> 54:51.773
and then I left, you know,
and I just...

54:51.844 --> 54:56.110
I needed someone to talk to
about this whole situation.

55:07.122 --> 55:09.283
I don't want that anymore.

55:10.692 --> 55:12.626
Tough night, Pete.

55:15.130 --> 55:16.654
It's gonna be okay.

55:16.731 --> 55:20.098
I want you to go home,
and I want you to get some rest.

55:22.304 --> 55:26.570
I'm gonna take care of this for you.
I don't know how, but I'm gonna do it.

55:26.641 --> 55:32.443
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you so early.

55:32.514 --> 55:36.883
I hope I didn't wake you up
or disturb your wife or anything.

55:38.487 --> 55:40.421
My wife.

55:46.595 --> 55:50.053
So did you get a look
at these two guys? Hello.

55:50.131 --> 55:51.496
- Yeah.
- What?

55:51.566 --> 55:53.932
What did they look like? Yeah.

55:54.002 --> 55:57.870
I never said that there were two...

55:57.939 --> 56:01.705
No, no. All right.
Have a good time.

56:01.776 --> 56:04.506
No, I think it was too dark...

56:04.579 --> 56:06.171
for me to see anything.

56:06.248 --> 56:09.547
Listen. I have to take this call
in the other room.

56:09.618 --> 56:11.017
It's my wife.

56:11.086 --> 56:13.611
Oh, yeah.

56:16.391 --> 56:20.487
Can't you understand I'm tied up?

56:20.562 --> 56:24.794
Not here.
Am I speaking French to you?

56:43.652 --> 56:45.483
What the hell? Not the yard!

57:53.788 --> 57:57.554
- Hey, leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our na...

57:57.626 --> 58:00.493
Linc, if you get this message,
do not go back to the apartment.

58:00.562 --> 58:02.587
There's cops all over the place.

58:02.664 --> 58:06.259
Just meet me and Julie down at that
place at the beach tomorrow morning.

58:18.346 --> 58:20.280
Hi, Mom.

58:25.787 --> 58:27.778
What's happened to you?

58:31.226 --> 58:35.856
Well, you know,
things are pretty fucked up, Ma.

58:35.930 --> 58:38.057
Don't use that foul language with me.

58:38.133 --> 58:40.693
Who is it, honey?

58:43.104 --> 58:45.231
Hi, Dad.

58:46.374 --> 58:47.636
What do you want?

58:50.812 --> 58:53.906
Let me get you
some clean clothes, okay?

59:00.955 --> 59:03.048
Well, I was...

59:03.124 --> 59:06.287
- I was just... You know, I just...
- We're not bailing you out.

59:07.929 --> 59:11.023
What? What do you mean,
you're not bailing me out?

59:11.099 --> 59:13.761
The police already came by.

59:13.835 --> 59:17.931
What? No, no.
The police are in on it, Dad.

59:18.006 --> 59:20.839
- Come on. Save it.
- No, listen to me. Just for a second.

59:20.909 --> 59:23.639
I'm a police officer now, Dad.

59:23.712 --> 59:26.476
- Oh, you're a police officer?
- Yes, I'm a police officer.

59:26.548 --> 59:29.517
Here we go.
Some clean clothes, honey.

59:29.584 --> 59:33.384
- Now clean up. You're a mess.
- I don't need clean clothes right now.

59:33.455 --> 59:36.083
- They're his.
- Officer Pete?

59:38.226 --> 59:40.820
Why are you laughing at me?

59:43.465 --> 59:46.866
Officer Pete. Betty,
you know, at least he got a haircut.

59:46.935 --> 59:50.701
Maybe when they make him captain,
they'll give him a uniform.

59:50.772 --> 59:53.172
Why don't you just
give him a chance?

01:00:24.172 --> 01:00:26.606
I'm sorry about your guy.

01:00:32.881 --> 01:00:35.645
He wasn't my guy.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.954
Well, I guess not.

01:00:42.023 --> 01:00:43.957
He's a pimp.

01:00:46.327 --> 01:00:48.261
He's not sober.

01:00:51.432 --> 01:00:54.629
And on the phone he was saying
something about Tricky.

01:00:57.639 --> 01:01:00.335
The guy was playing with me
the entire time.

01:01:16.024 --> 01:01:18.356
Well, I think everything's
gonna be okay.

01:01:21.529 --> 01:01:23.463
You think?

01:01:24.866 --> 01:01:26.993
It just feels good to say it.

01:01:57.866 --> 01:02:00.232
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:02:13.681 --> 01:02:15.842
If you need to go to a meeting...

01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:18.442
tomorrow morning...

01:02:18.519 --> 01:02:23.047
then I can go down
to the pier by myself.

01:02:23.124 --> 01:02:25.058
No, it's okay.

01:02:26.628 --> 01:02:28.061
Thanks.

01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:05.265
Would you just hold me?

01:03:21.249 --> 01:03:23.183
Thanks for being here.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.954
You too.

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:45.201
Damn, Sonny, what took you so long?
I was waitin' out there forever.

01:03:45.273 --> 01:03:48.640
What, I don't get no
"Hello. I miss you.

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:53.113
Sorry I didn't call your ass
until I needed some shit"?

01:03:53.181 --> 01:03:55.342
What happened to you?
What's with the fishin' hat?

01:03:56.517 --> 01:03:58.849
I'm tryin' to stay
on the undercover, man.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.880
Penitentiary life ain't good
for a brother, is it?

01:04:00.922 --> 01:04:02.856
You got the info or what, man?

01:04:02.924 --> 01:04:05.552
Your man Gilbert O'Reilly was dealin'.

01:04:05.626 --> 01:04:07.821
What you mean "was"?

01:04:07.895 --> 01:04:12.662
It was on the news. They found him at
the beach with another dude, both dead.

01:04:12.734 --> 01:04:16.727
Cops said it was a murder-suicide.
I think it was some S-M shit myself.

01:04:17.805 --> 01:04:20.035
All right, look, Sonny, man.

01:04:20.108 --> 01:04:22.633
I'm gonna need to borrow your car.

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:25.838
Hell, no. You might be named
after Lincoln who freed the slaves...

01:04:25.913 --> 01:04:28.381
but I ain't about
to free my wheels up, man.

01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:31.077
I got some shit goin' down tonight.

01:04:31.152 --> 01:04:33.586
I could use a partner
like the old days, you know?

01:04:33.654 --> 01:04:37.112
- Don't waste your breath.
- You know you can run now.

01:04:37.191 --> 01:04:40.183
- Sonny.
- Track star!

01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:44.027
Just consider this my way of keeping
your skinny ass out of a life of crime.

01:04:44.098 --> 01:04:46.362
Don't save me
from a life of crime, man.

01:04:46.434 --> 01:04:48.766
Crime pays. Well.

01:05:03.518 --> 01:05:05.850
Did you ever break-dance
when you were in school?

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:11.625
- I imagine you did, though.
- I can break-dance.

01:05:17.231 --> 01:05:18.664
Disgusting.

01:05:21.169 --> 01:05:25.162
I'm like a ladies' man.
I love to dance.

01:05:29.911 --> 01:05:31.879
Knock it off.

01:05:31.946 --> 01:05:33.573
- What?
- Looking.

01:05:33.648 --> 01:05:35.582
Oh, come on.

01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:04.977
Oh, man!
What did you do to my car, man?

01:06:05.046 --> 01:06:07.640
- Oh, shit.
- Look at this.

01:06:07.715 --> 01:06:09.675
- What did you do to my goddamn car?
- Linc, wait.

01:06:09.717 --> 01:06:14.245
Wait. Okay. Just don't say anything
for a second. Let me just explain it.

01:06:14.322 --> 01:06:18.759
Let me just explain it,
all right?

01:06:18.826 --> 01:06:24.230
- He said something about a big deal.
- Jules, it makes total sense, man.

01:06:24.298 --> 01:06:26.232
Last night
I stopped in on a friend.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.734
Got the car, some clothes,
and I got some information.

01:06:28.803 --> 01:06:31.135
Turns out that Gilbert
was Tricky's snitch.

01:06:31.205 --> 01:06:33.173
Here you go.

01:06:33.241 --> 01:06:37.007
I didn't know if you wanted cream
or half and half or sugar or Equal or...

01:06:37.078 --> 01:06:40.536
Black's fine. It's fine.

01:06:40.615 --> 01:06:43.083
- All right.
- Did I miss something?

01:06:47.155 --> 01:06:50.022
- You sure?
- Yes.

01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:52.855
Check it out.
All right. Here's what we got.

01:06:52.927 --> 01:06:55.725
Now Billy's workin' something,
runnin' with the men in blue.

01:06:55.796 --> 01:06:57.774
And Gilbert definitely
didn't take out the bald guy...

01:06:57.798 --> 01:06:59.857
so he probably
didn't cap himself either.

01:06:59.934 --> 01:07:03.165
So since Gilbert was Tricky's snitch,
he's hooked in too.

01:07:03.237 --> 01:07:05.215
And whoever stole the drugs
from the evidence locker...

01:07:05.239 --> 01:07:06.706
was trying to frame Captain Greer.

01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:09.766
Wait. No, I didn't hear
anything you guys just said.

01:07:09.844 --> 01:07:12.608
The cops, man... Tricky,
Eckford, Lanier, the whole gang...

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.705
They're all into something.

01:07:14.782 --> 01:07:17.945
No. Mothershed. When I was at his house,
he said there were two guys.

01:07:18.019 --> 01:07:20.954
- And I never even said that.
- Yeah, right.

01:07:21.022 --> 01:07:25.322
Whatever they got goin' got something
to do with Billy, Gilbert and drugs.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:32.160
This is like one of those dirty cop
drug things. This shit really happens?

01:07:32.233 --> 01:07:34.360
- Looks that way.
- And Greer was onto him.

01:07:34.435 --> 01:07:37.666
That's why there was all
that secret stuff before he died.

01:07:40.741 --> 01:07:42.675
That's why he died.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:49.213
He was trying to protect us.

01:07:49.283 --> 01:07:50.716
Yeah.

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:53.920
So what now?

01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:59.748
You know, we need to get some evidence.
We need some evidence.

01:08:00.828 --> 01:08:03.729
Just trust me. They all
gotta meet up and go over the plan.

01:08:03.798 --> 01:08:05.891
- Really?
- Look, these stupid motherfuckers...

01:08:05.967 --> 01:08:07.901
are nothin' if not predictable, man.

01:08:09.937 --> 01:08:13.395
- So how long do we do this?
- Till something happens.

01:08:14.575 --> 01:08:18.841
Is this all that cops do...
Sit around in cars, waiting?

01:08:18.912 --> 01:08:20.846
We can go get some doughnuts.

01:08:28.055 --> 01:08:29.988
I gotta pee.

01:08:42.703 --> 01:08:43.965
What did I tell you?

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.700
Looks like that's all of 'em.

01:08:48.576 --> 01:08:51.067
- I'm goin' in.
- What?

01:08:51.145 --> 01:08:53.238
Pete, your ankle's all messed up.

01:08:53.314 --> 01:08:55.077
I'm good at this. Don't worry.

01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:56.707
We'll all go.

01:08:56.783 --> 01:08:58.843
No. It's too much noise.
Don't worry about it.

01:08:58.919 --> 01:09:01.888
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:09:05.626 --> 01:09:08.117
You really think
he can pull this off?

01:09:09.596 --> 01:09:11.656
That's it. We don't want
no more to do with this.

01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:13.700
Come on, Carl.
Don't be such a pussy.

01:09:13.768 --> 01:09:15.792
- Don't call me a pussy.
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:18.100
- See what this thing is doing to us?
- What?

01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:22.268
- We out of here.
- Ah, shit. Come on, Carl. Come here.

01:09:22.343 --> 01:09:25.403
- This was supposed to be about drugs.
- Two people are dead.

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.879
- Three.
- What?

01:09:27.948 --> 01:09:31.542
- The bald guy at Gilbert's.
- Couldn't be helped.

01:09:31.618 --> 01:09:33.917
Look, Gilbert was an asshole.

01:09:33.988 --> 01:09:35.921
Almost gettin' arrested
at the bust...

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:38.618
not stayin' away after we fired him,
talkin' to Greer.

01:09:38.693 --> 01:09:40.319
Little shit deserved to die.

01:09:40.394 --> 01:09:44.626
- Why did you have to kill Greer?
- He knew about us and the drugs, okay?

01:09:44.698 --> 01:09:46.633
Got in the way.

01:09:47.702 --> 01:09:50.966
- This is bad. I want out.
- Yeah, me too.

01:09:51.037 --> 01:09:53.063
It's too late for that, Carl.

01:09:55.242 --> 01:09:56.675
Come on.

01:10:00.448 --> 01:10:02.439
This is our lives, asshole.

01:10:02.516 --> 01:10:05.849
Now, you wanna get in our way,
you take your best shot.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.115
But I ain't guaranteein'
where you'll end up.

01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:11.420
Ernie, come on.
Put it down, man.

01:10:11.492 --> 01:10:13.084
We're all in this to the end, right?

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.926
If this deal goes through,
we're set for life. Come on.

01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:21.100
So what's the plan?

01:10:21.168 --> 01:10:23.136
Over here. I'm wet. Come on.

01:10:24.205 --> 01:10:26.332
All right. Here it is.

01:10:26.407 --> 01:10:30.002
Billy set up a big deal
with this rock manager Howard.

01:10:30.077 --> 01:10:32.511
- You sure we can trust this Billy guy?
- Yeah.

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:35.549
He did a good job sellin' the drugs
after we got rid of Gilbert.

01:10:35.616 --> 01:10:37.743
And this new deal is his idea anyhow.

01:10:37.818 --> 01:10:40.844
You see, this Howard guy...
He's got some famous rock band...

01:10:40.921 --> 01:10:42.980
flyin' in,
and the drugs are on the plane.

01:10:43.057 --> 01:10:47.517
- Who's the band?
- How should I know who the band is?

01:10:47.595 --> 01:10:49.529
It's just voices on a tape, man.

01:10:49.597 --> 01:10:52.532
To hell with voices on a tape.
We bring this to IA. That's it.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.194
Pete, Linc's right.
They're not gonna believe it.

01:10:55.269 --> 01:10:59.365
Look. We can't trust anybody,
all right? It's just us.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.374
Oh, God.

01:11:04.311 --> 01:11:06.404
Okay, so... Then, wh...

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.641
Sorry. What do you wanna do?

01:11:08.716 --> 01:11:10.650
I know where the rock manager lives.

01:11:10.718 --> 01:11:13.209
We have to find out when
and where it's happening.

01:11:13.287 --> 01:11:16.882
Fine. I'll go over there, I'll get tight
with them, and I'll find out something.

01:11:16.957 --> 01:11:20.723
You can't do that, 'cause if Billy's
there, you're dead. He can make us.

01:11:20.795 --> 01:11:22.729
I got Billy.

01:11:24.665 --> 01:11:27.896
- Are you sure?
- Anybody got a better idea?

01:11:27.968 --> 01:11:30.232
Then I got your back, Julie.

01:11:30.304 --> 01:11:31.896
All right.

01:11:31.972 --> 01:11:36.238
Leave a message at home and let us know
what's goin' on, all right?

01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:40.440
All right. Let's do it.

01:11:58.632 --> 01:12:01.192
Where you been? I called your house.
I called the club.

01:12:01.268 --> 01:12:03.759
- They said you're not working anymore.
- I quit.

01:12:05.973 --> 01:12:08.032
I'm not a very good waitress.

01:12:08.108 --> 01:12:10.941
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

01:12:11.011 --> 01:12:15.311
No, everything's fine.
No, I was looking for you too.

01:12:15.382 --> 01:12:17.282
You were lookin' for me too?

01:12:17.351 --> 01:12:19.444
Yeah.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.114
Well, here I am.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:51.884
What?

01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:54.477
Says Billy sent him over.

01:12:54.555 --> 01:12:57.888
There. Sit down.
Oh, I'm so sorry about the mess.

01:12:57.958 --> 01:13:01.917
- I'm redecorating. Yeah?
- I know you told me to stay in there.

01:13:03.097 --> 01:13:04.689
Can I get a soda?

01:13:05.933 --> 01:13:08.663
- Soda. I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty.

01:13:11.338 --> 01:13:14.068
I'm sorry.
My little baby is thirsty.

01:13:14.141 --> 01:13:16.075
Come here.

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.374
I'm sorry. This is not
gonna take very long, okay?

01:13:22.449 --> 01:13:26.078
All right. You go ahead.
You go get yourself a fuckin' sodie.

01:13:29.924 --> 01:13:31.619
Not bad, huh?

01:13:31.692 --> 01:13:34.490
You want a fuckin' sodie too?

01:13:34.562 --> 01:13:37.759
- I'm cool.
- Yes.

01:13:39.033 --> 01:13:41.627
Yes, you are.

01:13:42.536 --> 01:13:44.868
You are cool, aren't you?

01:13:48.342 --> 01:13:50.276
So?

01:13:51.178 --> 01:13:54.978
You're movin' a lot of shit.
Billy thought you might need some help.

01:13:58.786 --> 01:14:01.949
Sweet little Billy.
But nice to know he cares.

01:14:09.063 --> 01:14:10.997
Okay, now.

01:14:11.065 --> 01:14:13.158
If I'm out of line here,
you just let me know, okay?

01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:15.758
Or storm off or do whatever.

01:14:17.638 --> 01:14:19.572
I got us a room.

01:14:24.812 --> 01:14:26.973
Right on.

01:14:30.451 --> 01:14:32.442
- Could I borrow the phone?
- Sure.

01:14:32.519 --> 01:14:35.215
Just dial nine to get out.

01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:45.310
- Leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our...

01:14:47.434 --> 01:14:51.200
- You have no messages.
- Thank you.

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:12.588
Wanna dance?

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:15.390
What?

01:15:16.463 --> 01:15:17.725
Come on.

01:15:17.798 --> 01:15:19.732
Dance with me.

01:15:22.536 --> 01:15:24.470
I love this song.

01:15:25.973 --> 01:15:28.237
Come on.
It's just a little dance.

01:15:28.308 --> 01:15:30.970
I'm not a fag.
I just like to dance.

01:15:31.045 --> 01:15:35.141
Uh, you lead.
I'll be the girl. Yeah.

01:15:46.226 --> 01:15:49.161
I should get goin', man.
I got some business to handle.

01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:51.959
You're a classy dancer,
you know that?

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.331
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

01:15:55.402 --> 01:15:57.336
I forgot. What's your name?

01:16:01.275 --> 01:16:03.334
Spin me, Linc.

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.241
What?

01:16:05.312 --> 01:16:07.974
I said spin me.

01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:19.825
We could enter a contest.

01:16:22.429 --> 01:16:25.455
You can ride with us
in the morning, okay?

01:16:25.532 --> 01:16:27.466
Come on.

01:16:55.863 --> 01:16:58.331
Okay, I got it.
Agua Dulce Airport.

01:16:58.398 --> 01:17:00.730
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
Bob, she's fine.

01:17:00.801 --> 01:17:03.065
She doesn't know a thing.
Don't worry about it.

01:17:05.472 --> 01:17:07.406
You fuckin' woke her up, man.

01:18:03.964 --> 01:18:06.228
I didn't do him, okay?

01:18:13.707 --> 01:18:15.641
What about Linc?

01:18:17.578 --> 01:18:19.705
Oh, he didn't leave a message.

01:18:21.748 --> 01:18:23.773
We gotta go.

01:18:23.851 --> 01:18:25.819
Are you sure about that?

01:18:25.886 --> 01:18:28.354
I overheard him say that
on the phone in the bathroom.

01:18:28.422 --> 01:18:32.119
And that piece of paper I found
in his pants said Aqua Dulce Airport.

01:18:32.192 --> 01:18:34.820
Jesus. Dirty cops,
drops at the airport.

01:18:34.895 --> 01:18:37.921
I feel like one of us should say
we're gettin' too old for this shit.

01:18:37.998 --> 01:18:40.865
At least it's not goin' down
in an abandoned warehouse.

01:18:43.804 --> 01:18:45.738
Yeah.

01:18:57.985 --> 01:19:00.749
You gotta hear these guys.
They can really rock, man.

01:19:00.821 --> 01:19:02.982
I mean, this band
can rock and roll.

01:19:03.056 --> 01:19:04.990
These boys are the bomb.

01:19:31.285 --> 01:19:33.583
All right.
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

01:19:33.654 --> 01:19:35.884
- What?
- Just stay here, all right?

01:19:42.829 --> 01:19:45.263
Let's go greet the fuckin' kids.

01:19:49.736 --> 01:19:52.569
Be nice to the boys, okay?

01:19:55.909 --> 01:20:00.175
- Hey! Kevin, how are you, baby?
- Howie!

01:20:00.247 --> 01:20:03.512
Hey, Kirk! Kris, how you doin', babe?
How are you?

01:20:03.583 --> 01:20:06.484
Oh, come on! Will ya pl...

01:20:06.553 --> 01:20:11.855
Hey, will you turn down the tunes
a scootch, please? Thanks. Listen, boys.

01:20:13.293 --> 01:20:15.227
Big people got some biz here.

01:20:15.295 --> 01:20:17.661
So why don't you hop into the limo...

01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:20.199
scoot over to the hotel,
we'll catch up with you later.

01:20:20.267 --> 01:20:23.964
- Come on. Can't we stay with you?
- Come on. Be good, boys.

01:20:24.037 --> 01:20:26.471
- We won't do anything.
- Give us a hug. Come on.

01:20:29.242 --> 01:20:32.336
- Go ahead. Go!
- Bye!

01:20:32.412 --> 01:20:33.845
See you at the hotel.

01:20:33.914 --> 01:20:36.542
- Don't be long.
- We missed you.

01:21:11.151 --> 01:21:13.085
Where the hell is that schmuck?

01:21:14.888 --> 01:21:17.914
Where'd you go?

01:21:17.991 --> 01:21:20.425
I called for backup.

01:21:20.494 --> 01:21:22.223
- What's goin' on?
- Linc's inside.

01:21:25.832 --> 01:21:28.926
God, that almost is
an abandoned warehouse.

01:21:29.002 --> 01:21:31.436
I'm gettin' too old for this shit.

01:21:58.165 --> 01:22:01.623
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

01:22:01.701 --> 01:22:04.602
Oh, God. Okay.

01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:11.977
- Hey, you guys got a bathroom in here?
- Over there.

01:22:28.995 --> 01:22:31.828
- You're late.
- Sorry. I had to rent a car, man.

01:22:31.898 --> 01:22:34.298
Someone stole mine
from your party the other night.

01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:37.393
What do we do?

01:22:39.172 --> 01:22:40.867
- Let's go.
- What? Where?

01:22:40.941 --> 01:22:43.273
Get the car. Come on. Let's go.

01:22:48.448 --> 01:22:51.508
- Oh, God.
- You want me to drive?

01:22:51.585 --> 01:22:53.985
No. Linc wouldn't want you
driving his car.

01:22:59.159 --> 01:23:02.026
So, do we do this now...

01:23:02.095 --> 01:23:04.825
or do we wait for your boyfriend
to come out of the toilet?

01:23:06.199 --> 01:23:07.757
What?

01:23:09.703 --> 01:23:13.969
Your fella. He's a good dancer.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.205
Dancer? I don't know no dancer.
Are you serious?

01:23:22.215 --> 01:23:24.877
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

01:23:24.951 --> 01:23:29.285
Uh-huh. No, brother's not with me.

01:23:30.357 --> 01:23:32.723
- He's a cop.
- What?

01:23:35.095 --> 01:23:38.064
- Stop messin' around.
- You'll know when I am. He's a cop!

01:23:38.131 --> 01:23:39.792
- Police!
- Freeze!

01:23:39.866 --> 01:23:42.391
- Drop the weapons!
- Drop 'em!

01:23:42.469 --> 01:23:44.403
- Right now! Drop 'em!
- Put 'em down!

01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:46.132
Down!

01:23:46.206 --> 01:23:47.639
Drop 'em! Get 'em out of here!

01:23:47.707 --> 01:23:50.642
- Come on, big man.
- Hey, this is fucked up.

01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:52.974
Faster.

01:23:56.082 --> 01:23:57.709
Teamwork.

01:23:57.784 --> 01:24:01.811
Let's go. Get out of here.
You too, home skillet.

01:24:01.888 --> 01:24:03.913
On the wall.

01:24:06.359 --> 01:24:07.986
Spread 'em!

01:24:11.831 --> 01:24:13.765
You dead, boy.

01:24:22.175 --> 01:24:23.836
Stop!

01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:25.400
Is that Eckford?

01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:28.242
- He better move.
- Right on.

01:24:34.854 --> 01:24:36.287
- Jump!
- What?

01:24:36.356 --> 01:24:38.483
Jump!

01:24:38.558 --> 01:24:41.925
- Oh, my God! My ankle!
- Get away from the door!

01:25:19.432 --> 01:25:22.526
Hey, kid, I don't think
you're gonna make it.

01:25:33.146 --> 01:25:35.580
- Fuck this fair fighting shit.
- Okay.

01:26:11.484 --> 01:26:13.076
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

01:26:13.153 --> 01:26:14.620
Gotta go.

01:26:14.688 --> 01:26:16.383
I got a plan.

01:26:32.772 --> 01:26:34.706
Does this mean
you're mad at me again?

01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:42.413
You gonna kill him?

01:26:44.317 --> 01:26:45.750
No, I'm done.

01:26:56.663 --> 01:26:58.790
Hey, what are you doing, huh?

01:26:58.865 --> 01:27:00.976
I've got nothing to do with drugs.
I'm in the music business!

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.198
Hey, get this place taped off. You're
standing around like crossing guards.

01:27:14.781 --> 01:27:18.808
- Save me a dance, lover.
- What happened, Detective?

01:27:18.885 --> 01:27:23.379
Well, sir. We were bustin' 'em, and
these kids came in and tried to stop us.

01:27:23.456 --> 01:27:25.447
- That's bullshit.
- They tried to stop you?

01:27:25.525 --> 01:27:27.857
Yes, sir. Probably in on it too.

01:27:27.927 --> 01:27:31.124
- They set this up.
- They stole drugs from the evidence.

01:27:31.197 --> 01:27:34.462
- That's enough. Get 'em out of here.
- They killed Greer. He was onto them.

01:27:34.534 --> 01:27:35.865
Ask him.

01:27:37.837 --> 01:27:40.362
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.600
Ask him.

01:27:46.179 --> 01:27:51.708
Right before Billy hands over the cash,
we roll in and make the bust, okay?

01:27:51.785 --> 01:27:56.188
- Where are we gonna get that money?
- Carl, there is no money, okay?

01:27:56.256 --> 01:27:59.817
It's an empty bag.
We bust in before Billy hands it over.

01:27:59.893 --> 01:28:02.088
Anybody have any questions?
It's all pretty easy.

01:28:02.162 --> 01:28:04.756
We grab the drugs,
pretend to arrest Billy...

01:28:04.831 --> 01:28:08.198
next day he's out moving
the stuff for us, okay?

01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:12.595
Yeah, Bob!

01:28:17.343 --> 01:28:19.834
Assume the position.

01:28:22.415 --> 01:28:24.349
Assume it.

01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:32.657
You all right?

01:28:33.726 --> 01:28:36.889
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah.

01:28:36.963 --> 01:28:38.396
You?

01:28:40.633 --> 01:28:42.225
Yeah.

01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:46.538
Nice work.

01:28:46.606 --> 01:28:48.733
Thank you.

01:28:48.808 --> 01:28:51.276
So you kids are what...

01:28:51.344 --> 01:28:53.869
some kind of "mod squad"
or something?

01:29:05.758 --> 01:29:08.989
They say we're back on
if we want.

01:29:09.062 --> 01:29:12.691
- Yes.
- Won't be the same without Greer.

01:29:16.736 --> 01:29:18.670
What else we got?

01:29:23.076 --> 01:29:26.341
- So what? Are we in or...
- Right on.

01:29:27.981 --> 01:29:29.414
Solid.

01:29:33.353 --> 01:29:36.220
Oh, Linc, dude.
I know a guy down in Torrance...

01:29:36.289 --> 01:29:39.315
who is, like, the straight up wizard
of bondo.

01:29:39.392 --> 01:29:41.724
- And I'm sure he could fix up the car...
- Shut up, Pete.

01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:44.888
No, wait. I'm serious, dude.
No, this guy's like a bondo king.

01:29:44.964 --> 01:29:48.229
I'm sure he can slap that Lincoln
together in no time, right?

01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:50.861
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call my lawyer friend...

01:29:50.937 --> 01:29:55.806
to file a lawsuit against those guys
or the city or somebody, right?
