00:39.998 --> 00:42.167
- For turning your boyfriend
into a reptile.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.545
Your mom specifically told you
not to do that.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.838

01:11.613 --> 01:14.407
- So what are we going
to do with Dannyguana?

01:14.491 --> 01:18.203

is for Dannyguana

01:18.286 --> 01:19.996
to spend the night here
in the closet,

01:20.079 --> 01:21.581

a little nest or something?

01:26.544 --> 01:29.088

his natural habitat.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.298

04:34.065 --> 04:36.776

What?
- How's Tommy?

19:38.427 --> 19:39.511
- Holding up.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.473
- Hey!
Andi, you didn't get my text?

19:43.557 --> 19:44.892
We don't need the radios.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.394
- Uh, no, I didn't.

19:47.477 --> 19:49.771
See, cell phones
are so unreliable,

19:49.855 --> 19:52.274
which is exactly why
we need my radios.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.776
- No, see, I had everyone

19:54.860 --> 19:56.820
download a G.P.S. locator app
on their phone.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.113
See? This is me.
This is Daniel.

19:58.196 --> 20:01.658
- Oh, yeah.
And where am I?

20:01.742 --> 20:03.535
Is that me?
- No, that's me.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.953
See, this is why you shouldn't
be in charge

20:05.037 --> 20:07.205
of communication tools,

20:07.289 --> 20:09.541
because obviously,
you aren't qualified.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.751
What are you guys doing?

20:10.834 --> 20:12.920
ANDI: [yells]

20:16.715 --> 20:18.300
- Hey, thanks
for helping me search.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.676
- I'll make more
posters tonight.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.553
- You might want to go easier
on the glitter.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.972
- Hey, the more noticeable
the better, right?

20:24.056 --> 20:24.806
- You're right.
I take it back.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.601
Glitter your heart out.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.188
Hey, you want to walk together
to school Monday?

20:38.445 --> 20:40.322
- [gasps]
Iguana?

20:43.158 --> 20:44.952
Where did you come from?

20:50.290 --> 20:51.708
- Hey, Emma,
I forgot my jacket.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.878
Iguana?

20:56.630 --> 20:57.673
- Now, remember,

20:57.756 --> 21:01.635
we are never
to speak of this ever again.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.345
Right?

21:03.428 --> 21:05.347
BOTH: Right.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.266
- [laughs]

21:08.350 --> 21:11.311
I still can't believe
you kissed an iguana.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.854
- Was it romantic?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.690
- Hey, what did I just say?

21:22.280 --> 21:25.867
- Is something wrong, Sophie?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.202
- What's the big deal?

21:27.285 --> 21:28.704
She stares blankly at the wall
all the time.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.872
- Is that--

21:30.956 --> 21:32.249
am I seeing things?

21:32.332 --> 21:33.583
BOTH: Probably.

21:35.293 --> 21:36.211
- [gasps]

21:36.294 --> 21:38.880
Katie, Maddie, that's a--

21:38.964 --> 21:41.174
a boy!
BOTH: What?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.010
- There's a boy
by your shelf.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.469
Look.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.022
