WEBVTT

00:03.456 --> 00:06.576
The name of the ship
on which Sinbad sailed!

00:06.656 --> 00:08.976
Lord Akbari, please, I beg you!

00:09.056 --> 00:11.776
I'm only a humble Harbour Master.

00:11.856 --> 00:13.696
I don't know!

00:13.776 --> 00:15.496
Then what use are you to me?

00:16.976 --> 00:19.016
No!

00:20.816 --> 00:22.296
Master.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.695
There's only one way
to find Sinbad now.

01:27.136 --> 01:30.256
Well, I'm just anticipating it,
all right?

01:31.736 --> 01:33.816
OK, well...

01:33.896 --> 01:37.496
Now, don't worry. It doesn't taste
like the first bottle.

01:38.696 --> 01:39.816
It tastes worse.

01:41.696 --> 01:43.416
Oh, that's vile. Right?

01:43.496 --> 01:44.456
Ah!

01:45.816 --> 01:48.456
I still don't understand why you're
so keen to get this tattoo.

01:48.536 --> 01:51.336
I think we should
just all be glad... Ah!

01:51.416 --> 01:53.936
The good doctor is finally
throwing caution to the wind.

01:54.016 --> 01:57.256
I think he wants something to
remember this trip by. Exactly.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.131
At least this way I have something

01:59.156 --> 02:00.896
to remind me of all the people
I've met along the way.

02:00.976 --> 02:04.176
Anwar, just stop talking and sit
still. You're worse than a girl.

02:04.256 --> 02:07.496
Loosen up, yeah.

02:08.776 --> 02:11.856
Yeah, there we go! So, what's the
story behind your tattoo, then?

02:11.936 --> 02:13.056
Ah, it's a farming tattoo.

02:14.256 --> 02:18.416
A blessing to have the sheep be more
productive in their breeding.

02:18.496 --> 02:20.936
Breeding?

02:24.456 --> 02:28.256
Please don't give me
one of them. Don't move!

02:28.336 --> 02:31.136
So, uh, you going back there,
then, to the farm?

02:32.336 --> 02:35.456
Ah, it's a big world out there.
Lots of trading still to be done.

02:37.456 --> 02:38.936
Home can wait. Anwar!

02:39.016 --> 02:41.016
No, look, I just need some air.

02:41.096 --> 02:45.536
Unbelievable. Ha, ha-ha!
No, I'm just...

02:45.616 --> 02:50.776
Go. It's the alcohol.
I'll be back in a minute.

02:50.856 --> 02:52.536
Oh, he's so scared.

02:59.856 --> 03:01.456
Come on.

03:01.536 --> 03:08.696
Just a tattoo, Anwar. It's just
a permanent mark on your skin.

03:08.776 --> 03:10.776
God! I don't want to...

03:29.896 --> 03:31.776
Guys, we need to leave.

03:31.856 --> 03:34.216
If you don't want a tattoo,
just say so.

03:34.296 --> 03:36.936
No, it's not... It's a wise
choice... Oh, really?

03:37.016 --> 03:38.856
Is what your parents would say.

03:40.616 --> 03:43.016
There are Basra guards here.
Four of them. What?

03:43.096 --> 03:44.696
Behind me.

03:44.776 --> 03:46.736
Don't look.

03:46.816 --> 03:49.136
Just...
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

03:49.216 --> 03:51.576
This far from Basra. No.

03:51.656 --> 03:53.296
No coincidence.

03:53.376 --> 03:54.736
Somehow they know you are here.

03:54.816 --> 03:58.256
Well, then maybe I should help them
find what they're looking for.

03:58.336 --> 04:01.736
No, no, no, no, no. I am not going to
run from them. Yes, you are.

04:01.816 --> 04:04.776
It's the best way.
Get back to the ship.

04:04.856 --> 04:07.736
Be careful. Bring her around
to the cape on the other side.

04:07.816 --> 04:09.496
Shouldn't we all stay together?

04:09.576 --> 04:13.976
No, they'll be watching the docks for
him. No, look, because of men like
that, my brother is dead.

04:14.056 --> 04:15.576
And you want the rest of us
to join him?

04:16.776 --> 04:19.416
I imagine Akbari
wants you taken alive.

04:19.495 --> 04:21.935
But, if they catch the rest of us
in your company...

04:26.216 --> 04:29.176
Look, swallow your temper,

04:29.256 --> 04:31.296
and think of a way
of getting us out of here.

04:36.096 --> 04:37.256
What?

04:37.336 --> 04:39.296
She didn't mean anything
to me, I swear!

04:39.376 --> 04:42.496
Then why were you kissing her, huh!?
I didn't kiss her. You did too!

04:42.576 --> 04:45.656
Stop. He's mine now.

04:47.976 --> 04:49.296
No, he's mine!

04:58.016 --> 04:59.656
Don't get any big ideas, lover boy.

05:29.816 --> 05:31.496
Anyone else getting a bad feeling?

05:33.816 --> 05:37.336
Cook said if there was trouble, he'd
lower the flag. If there was trouble

05:37.416 --> 05:39.856
maybe he didn't get the chance.
I hope not.

05:39.936 --> 05:43.016
Without Sinbad or Gunnar,
I don't like our chances.

05:45.656 --> 05:47.896
I can take care of us.

05:49.856 --> 05:52.936
We stick to the plan
and get back on the ship.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.456
Come on.

06:12.176 --> 06:13.536
We keep moving.

06:13.616 --> 06:15.736
Cut across the land,
keeping the sun on our right

06:15.816 --> 06:17.736
and we make it to
the cape on the other side.

06:17.816 --> 06:20.936
Great, crawling on our bellies
like the cowardly rats we are.

06:21.016 --> 06:23.816
Rats are smart.
They have survival instinct.

06:23.896 --> 06:27.056
You can learn something from them.
Learn?

06:27.136 --> 06:28.816
I grew up on streets like these.

06:28.896 --> 06:31.736
I don't need a farmer telling me
how to sneak through them.

06:40.376 --> 06:41.816
The coast is clear.

06:41.896 --> 06:43.336
Come on.

06:45.736 --> 06:47.856
Anwar. Leave off!

06:51.056 --> 06:55.536
See? I told you.
No problem. Your hand's shaking.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.096
Let's be honest, we're all
out of our depths on this one.

06:58.176 --> 06:59.616
Speak for yourself.

07:01.416 --> 07:03.056
Run. Now!

07:08.136 --> 07:12.896
And all the fishes in the sea
came swimming neatly home to me.

07:33.136 --> 07:36.416
Come on. Where are you going?
We need to go back and around.

07:36.496 --> 07:40.896
There's a second patrol coming this
way. That's taking a risk. Well...

07:40.976 --> 07:42.456
Gunnar! Come on.

07:51.696 --> 07:53.816
I'll take it from here.

07:53.896 --> 07:56.576
You may fool Lord Akbari
with your magic act...

07:57.936 --> 07:59.816
but it won't work with me.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.696
I'm so sorry.

08:01.776 --> 08:04.456
I've seen your future.

08:04.536 --> 08:05.976
You won't live to go home.

08:06.056 --> 08:09.376
Your wife, your children,
you'll never see them again.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.736
This place will be your tomb.

08:11.816 --> 08:14.216
Keep playing your games

08:14.296 --> 08:18.216
but my men
will bring Akbari the fugitive.

08:18.296 --> 08:20.576
Not you.

08:43.176 --> 08:45.216
What do you think you're doing?

08:46.336 --> 08:48.296
You lied to me.

08:48.376 --> 08:52.016
There was no second patrol!
I told you - I'm not going to run.

08:52.096 --> 08:55.376
Then you're a fool! You can't
take them on all by yourself.

08:55.456 --> 08:57.896
And I won't fight along side you.
Gunnar!

09:03.616 --> 09:06.056
Now, we move.

09:14.998 --> 09:15.943
Gunnar.

09:17.136 --> 09:18.216
Gunnar.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.536
Are we going to talk about that?

09:25.096 --> 09:26.896
I've never seen you that angry.

09:31.096 --> 09:33.056
Who are you?

09:35.456 --> 09:38.056
I'm just a man...

09:38.136 --> 09:41.216
who thinks you should save your
energy for walking and not talking.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.976
It's a long hike to the cape

09:44.056 --> 09:46.696
if night falls
and we haven't made it yet.

09:55.856 --> 10:00.096
I want to help you.
But, you need to help me first.

10:02.056 --> 10:06.216
Only you can save your friends now.
What does that mean?

10:07.696 --> 10:13.456
Lord Akbari has given the order
that anyone collaborating

10:13.536 --> 10:15.616
with Sinbad be put to the sword.

10:15.696 --> 10:20.176
One by one, your friends will die.

10:21.456 --> 10:23.616
I will kill them all. No.

10:25.576 --> 10:28.496
Tell me what you know
about Sinbad, where he's headed,

10:28.576 --> 10:31.696
and I will do everything
I can to protect your friends.

10:34.096 --> 10:38.216
I know how you're feeling.
Scared.

10:38.296 --> 10:40.656
Out of your depth.

10:40.736 --> 10:43.056
But we don't have much time.

10:43.136 --> 10:46.816
They... don't have much time.

10:49.976 --> 10:51.616
Then I'm sorry.

10:53.416 --> 10:55.576
Guards, execute the prisoners.

10:58.056 --> 10:59.056
The cape.

11:00.896 --> 11:04.176
He's heading to the cape
the other side of the island.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.456
Where's he headed to after that?

11:11.536 --> 11:13.896
Basra to see his family?

11:13.976 --> 11:15.616
Why not?

11:15.696 --> 11:17.296
I don't know.

11:28.376 --> 11:29.776
You can save her.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.336
You can be the hero.

11:32.416 --> 11:35.056
And all you have to do is tell me.

11:38.056 --> 11:40.536
Or, you can watch her die.

11:43.456 --> 11:45.056
Hm.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.216
He can't go back.

11:49.656 --> 11:53.896
His grandmother,
she put a curse on him.

11:56.376 --> 11:58.096
Thank you.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.256
You don't know what it's like.

12:04.336 --> 12:09.376
Every time I think of home,
I think of Akbari and my brother.

12:09.456 --> 12:13.456
You're angry and think you
have the right to take revenge.

12:13.536 --> 12:17.336
But you don't.
Sinbad, get control of yourself.

12:17.416 --> 12:20.976
You don't keep yourself in check,
you're going to end up
in real trouble.

12:24.056 --> 12:26.176
Shh! What?

12:28.656 --> 12:30.256
Run!

12:37.016 --> 12:38.696
The Khaima!

12:38.776 --> 12:40.176
You better draw your sword now.

12:40.256 --> 12:42.416
No! Gunnar, I'm serious. No.

13:01.176 --> 13:02.336
Gunnar!

13:24.016 --> 13:25.256
Gunnar!

13:52.296 --> 13:54.976
So, you're certain that Sinbad
is heading for the Cape?

13:55.056 --> 13:59.736
Yes. But by the time you get there,
I'll already have brought him back.

14:00.976 --> 14:03.696
They have no right to be on my ship.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.616
They're just possessions.
Meaningless.

14:06.696 --> 14:08.016
They don't feel meaningless.

14:08.096 --> 14:11.696
She said she needed something
of Sinbad's.

14:11.776 --> 14:13.856
Not clothes, something
that was part of him.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.896
What did you tell her up there?
I did what I had to protect us.

14:16.976 --> 14:18.536
What exactly does that mean?

14:33.056 --> 14:34.936
And who does this belong to?

14:36.456 --> 14:38.096
Is it his?

14:39.576 --> 14:41.056
Is it Sinbad's?

14:45.016 --> 14:47.176
You tried.

14:47.256 --> 14:49.656
Don't feel bad, you couldn't help it.

14:49.736 --> 14:53.576
It was just that little moment
of fear, of...

14:53.656 --> 14:56.896
being found out that told me
everything I needed to know.

15:01.016 --> 15:02.336
This is his hair.

15:11.576 --> 15:12.896
What's she doing?

15:12.976 --> 15:15.856
Old magic. Dark.

15:15.936 --> 15:18.456
She is summoning a hunter.

15:21.056 --> 15:23.696
Part of Sinbad, part of her.

15:47.776 --> 15:50.976
Sinbad is part of you
as you are part of me.

15:51.056 --> 15:54.736
Breathe what he breathes.
Feed off his emotion.

15:54.816 --> 15:56.976
Follow the magic of his curse.

15:59.096 --> 16:02.056
Go to him now.

16:03.216 --> 16:05.216
Bring him to me.

16:12.936 --> 16:14.336
Gunnar.

16:19.096 --> 16:20.776
What was that creature?

16:22.056 --> 16:26.296
Um, well, technically
it would be called a familiar,

16:26.376 --> 16:29.816
a creature created with a certain
bond to someone,

16:29.896 --> 16:33.416
though how it can actually move
and exist is quite extraordinary

16:33.496 --> 16:35.496
and, well, wrong.

16:35.576 --> 16:37.536
Strange, though.

16:37.616 --> 16:41.136
The way I heard it, you can only
use a creature like that

16:41.216 --> 16:43.816
if you knew your pray
had some magic about him.

16:43.896 --> 16:45.816
You told her about the curse!?

16:45.896 --> 16:48.016
I'm so sorry!

16:48.096 --> 16:51.136
Would you rather they slaughtered us
all one by one?

16:51.216 --> 16:54.296
And, if you hadn't been so fondly
keeping a lock of his hair

16:54.376 --> 16:55.376
hidden away...

16:55.456 --> 16:58.056
It will smell Sinbad out.

16:59.376 --> 17:01.016
It's connected to him now.

17:01.096 --> 17:03.056
I had no choice.

17:03.136 --> 17:05.455
I just hope Sinbad is safe.

17:08.976 --> 17:10.336
It's all in the muscles.

17:12.856 --> 17:15.656
Escapologists. Illusionists.

17:15.736 --> 17:17.455
Keep talking.
It's all you're good at.

17:17.536 --> 17:21.415
Able to expand and contract
their muscle groups accordingly

17:21.496 --> 17:23.496
when tied with ropes.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.616
Oh, and thieves too.

17:49.256 --> 17:50.976
Ah.

18:15.540 --> 18:19.020
Be careful!
Yes, I'm not going to rush.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.180
I might not be Sinbad,
but I can do this.

18:21.260 --> 18:22.660
Oh, yes, of course you can!

18:22.740 --> 18:25.100
All the time you spent studying
in dusty libraries.

18:25.180 --> 18:26.580
Shh! Go.

18:43.820 --> 18:46.860
Good plan. Distracting the guard.

18:46.940 --> 18:47.900
Worked well.

18:47.980 --> 18:51.780
I need to check his airways
are clear.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.180
What?!

18:53.260 --> 18:54.700
He could choke on his tongue.

18:54.780 --> 18:57.340
He wouldn't hesitate to kill us
if it was the other way around.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.340
Yes, well, I'm not the same as them.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.580
Did I just...?

19:10.660 --> 19:13.420
I think you did, Doctor.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.740
Get some rope.

20:32.020 --> 20:35.620
We've been looking for you for
a long time, Gunnar Halflidarson.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.460
Do you know why you're here?

20:58.540 --> 21:00.220
There must be some mistake.
What are you?

21:00.300 --> 21:04.700
I am just a trader.
Now, yes. But before?

21:04.780 --> 21:07.220
You know who we are. No.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.540
Yes, you do. No, I don't.

21:09.620 --> 21:14.540
I'm Obsidian.
And these are the Khaima.

21:14.620 --> 21:17.140
It's our job to bring
justice to the world...

21:17.220 --> 21:20.860
to protect the innocent
and punish the lawless.

21:20.940 --> 21:24.420
So, why are we interested
in you? I don't know.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.580
Liar. There must be some mistake.

21:27.660 --> 21:31.180
I am here with my friends
en route to Baruch.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.740
I have trading contacts there.

21:32.820 --> 21:38.340
Ah, so we made a mistake,
confused you with someone else.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.820
Yes.

21:39.900 --> 21:43.740
I see. Yes, you must have.

21:43.820 --> 21:47.100
Never have we got the wrong person.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.180
Not once has innocent blood
been spilled.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.220
We're thorough.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.740
We're sure.

21:58.820 --> 22:04.180
Perhaps rather than talk,
we should see.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.020
Do you remember, Gunnar?

22:26.740 --> 22:31.220
How it felt when you set foot
on fresh soil,

22:31.300 --> 22:34.700
you and your comrades, knowing
what you were about to do?

22:34.780 --> 22:36.620
I was never...

22:36.700 --> 22:37.780
I was...

22:39.380 --> 22:40.780
I was a farmer.

22:43.060 --> 22:45.340
We can only show the truth.

22:45.420 --> 22:47.220
We can't change it. Ah!

22:52.420 --> 22:54.660
Ah, you have to believe me! Men.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.780
I know nothing about this.

22:56.860 --> 22:58.660
Women.

23:02.700 --> 23:05.900
Children.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.820
Oh! Please!

23:07.900 --> 23:09.980
Please don't!

23:12.500 --> 23:13.740
Stop!

23:22.420 --> 23:24.260
I am...

23:25.500 --> 23:27.380
Valsgarde.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.380
And what life
did the Valsgarde lead?

23:35.100 --> 23:37.700
We were soldiers. Soldiers?

23:37.780 --> 23:39.340
We wouldn't spend
so much of our time

23:39.420 --> 23:42.420
bringing a mere soldier to justice.
We were warriors.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.140
Our name was feared across
the northlands.

23:47.220 --> 23:52.020
Anything in our path, we would burn.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.700
Destroy.

23:53.780 --> 23:58.020
Men, women...

24:01.100 --> 24:02.740
and children.

24:20.180 --> 24:22.540
She's in a trance.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.860
But there are two guards.
Even if we rush them,

24:24.940 --> 24:27.340
they'd cut us down
without drawing breath.

24:27.420 --> 24:29.860
I can explain to them
who my father is.

24:29.940 --> 24:31.580
Was.

24:31.660 --> 24:33.100
How important we were

24:33.180 --> 24:37.220
and how this is a huge
diplomatic error on their part.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.340
And if they let us go,

24:39.420 --> 24:42.980
I will personally make sure
there are no reprisals.

24:43.060 --> 24:47.140
Right. So, does anyone have a plan
that isn't totally stupid?

24:47.220 --> 24:49.500
My plan isn't stupid.
This is the real world.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.260
They are just working men. Exactly!

24:52.340 --> 24:54.540
So, Nala sort of has a point.
Thank you.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.380
This is just a job for them.

24:56.460 --> 24:59.020
You saw how horrified they were
when that thing was created.

24:59.100 --> 25:02.380
Ah, so we dress up as a monster
and we scare them.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.940
Oh, I like it.

25:04.020 --> 25:08.580
No. No, I'm happy to do it.
No, no.

25:08.660 --> 25:11.300
We play on their fears.

25:11.380 --> 25:15.300
Gunnar Halflidarson,
you've been judged for your crimes.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.260
Do you have anything to say
before we pass sentence?

25:19.340 --> 25:20.700
I accept my punishment.

25:22.060 --> 25:27.060
For the part I played,
the person I was.

25:27.140 --> 25:28.620
I am.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.540
You'll be put to the sword.

25:38.300 --> 25:42.500
Your people believe it's a great
honour to die in combat.

25:42.580 --> 25:45.820
We'll allow you that choice
if you so desire.

25:48.420 --> 25:55.300
I do not desire to draw my sword
in my own defence.

25:55.380 --> 25:58.140
So be it.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.940
What do you think you're doing!?
Trying to save your life.

26:08.020 --> 26:10.300
Do you want to die here?

26:10.380 --> 26:14.620
You're incredibly brave.
Look, I don't want any trouble.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.060
I just want to take my friend
and we'll go.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.060
I commend your spirit.

26:19.140 --> 26:24.060
Sneaking into one of our bases,
facing us the way you do.

26:24.140 --> 26:28.740
For that, at least, you have one
chance to turn around and walk away.

26:28.820 --> 26:33.020
Go. No. Go! No!

26:33.100 --> 26:35.940
Listen to me, if you get
in their way, they will kill you.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.300
What I have done, what I did.

26:40.420 --> 26:44.260
He's right, Sinbad.
I was a Valsgarde.

26:44.340 --> 26:45.740
A bloody, barbaric killer.

26:45.820 --> 26:50.220
I have run long enough. It ends here.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.380
That thing, it came back!

26:53.460 --> 26:55.460
That thing came back!

26:57.420 --> 26:59.060
It's gonna kill us all.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.660
See? I told you it would work.

27:05.740 --> 27:08.060
I see what you're thinking.

27:08.140 --> 27:10.980
How many of us can you take down,

27:11.060 --> 27:14.860
and would it ever be possible
for the two of you to escape?

27:32.500 --> 27:33.620
There's your answer.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.340
Your anger, your fury,
your lack of control

27:36.420 --> 27:39.180
defeated you even before
I'd raised my sword.

27:39.260 --> 27:43.540
You should have listened to your
friend. You should have run.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.740
Run. Don't you see?

28:04.820 --> 28:07.420
The creature is after you! Run!

28:09.340 --> 28:11.060
Run! Run!

28:19.223 --> 28:21.583
Not you. I can't let him.

28:21.663 --> 28:23.463
You don't have a choice.

28:32.143 --> 28:34.183
I won't let him face it alone.

28:34.263 --> 28:36.343
Clearly it was meant for him.
It will kill him!

28:36.423 --> 28:41.903
Why does a Valsgarde
care so much for a man like that?

28:41.983 --> 28:45.063
Obsidian, I give you my word,

28:45.143 --> 28:47.943
if you let me go after him,
I will return. I will not run.

28:49.263 --> 28:52.703
You are men of honour.
You protect the weak.

28:52.783 --> 28:55.543
And, Sinbad, he is...

29:07.823 --> 29:11.383
What are you doing? Stopping that
creature before it kills Sinbad.

29:11.463 --> 29:15.543
No, you don't understand what you've
done! It was meant to bring him back.

29:15.623 --> 29:18.463
Not kill him. Without me,
it has nothing to control it.

29:18.543 --> 29:20.463
She's lying!

29:20.543 --> 29:23.063
It won't stop now
until Sinbad is dead.

29:51.281 --> 29:53.401
No! No!

29:53.481 --> 29:56.561
No, please, listen, please.

29:56.641 --> 30:00.561
Listen, there's a creature after me.
We have to get away now!

30:00.641 --> 30:03.561
We are not going anywhere.
No! Listen!

30:03.641 --> 30:07.361
We return to Basra with you
as our prize and we are heroes.

30:07.441 --> 30:11.881
Akbari should know better than
to send a woman to do a man's job.

30:13.201 --> 30:17.081
Where are you?

30:17.161 --> 30:22.001
Where are you? No!

30:24.361 --> 30:28.401
I can't. I can't stop it.

30:31.201 --> 30:34.041
You have to listen to me!

31:00.401 --> 31:02.121
Sinbad! No!

31:09.241 --> 31:12.561
It's no use! It's feeding off you.

31:12.641 --> 31:14.001
You have to let go!

31:14.081 --> 31:17.801
Your emotions, your fury, your anger!
You have to let it go.

31:19.601 --> 31:20.921
No, Sinbad!

31:25.201 --> 31:26.881
Now, listen to me.

31:26.961 --> 31:28.841
You saw what I was like before.

31:28.921 --> 31:31.641
You can't give into that anger,
that rush.

31:33.681 --> 31:36.121
You can't. It will kill me.

31:36.201 --> 31:38.921
Sinbad, trust me.

32:13.961 --> 32:15.521
Go in peace.

32:17.801 --> 32:19.681
Sinbad.

32:19.761 --> 32:22.881
Are you all right? Thank you.

32:22.961 --> 32:24.881
Well done.

32:33.566 --> 32:34.886
No, wait.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.206
I gave him my word.

32:44.246 --> 32:46.086
I was sure you'd run.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.686
But you put your life
on the line for him.

32:48.766 --> 32:51.166
No thought for your own safety.

32:53.886 --> 32:56.286
You're not a Valsgarde.

32:56.366 --> 32:58.766
You're not a bloodthirsty killer.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.526
The Khaima could use a man like you.

33:08.846 --> 33:10.086
I am not ready.

33:10.166 --> 33:14.326
We'll train you, teach you.
A whole world you can't imagine.

33:19.086 --> 33:21.246
No. I'm not...

33:26.526 --> 33:29.526
I'm not ready to leave my friend.

34:01.886 --> 34:07.046
Akbari's mage, she created
a creature to go after you.

34:07.126 --> 34:10.402
I had no choice. If I had not done
his lordship's bidding, then...

34:14.606 --> 34:18.646
I'm sorry for all of you.
You're all marked now.

34:20.005 --> 34:22.446
Each one of you, fugitives.

34:22.525 --> 34:25.806
Akbari will hunt you down
for what you've done.

34:25.886 --> 34:27.406
And you tell Akbari that...

34:34.366 --> 34:37.646
You tell him to stop. We're done.

34:37.726 --> 34:39.766
He took my brother from me.

34:42.446 --> 34:44.366
The blood debt has been paid.

34:46.886 --> 34:49.085
You're going to let her go?

34:51.846 --> 34:53.766
We're not killers.

34:53.846 --> 34:56.726
If it's because you're squeamish...
It's not what she's done.

35:00.926 --> 35:01.926
It's Akbari.

35:08.886 --> 35:11.606
Sometimes you have
to let things go.

36:27.526 --> 36:32.526
There was this village, Hindmark,
little farming place.

36:34.206 --> 36:38.086
Beautiful. The Valsgarde
tore through it one morning.

36:39.646 --> 36:44.046
Torching the buildings.
Putting down any resistance.

36:45.846 --> 36:53.086
Just as we were leaving, somebody
starts to strike me from behind.

36:54.566 --> 37:00.046
I turn and see this little old lady
standing there, tiny thing.

37:03.526 --> 37:06.166
She has a walking stick in her hand.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.606
She's hitting me with it
again and again.

37:10.926 --> 37:13.806
Everybody's laughing at her.

37:13.886 --> 37:15.926
She's too old and weak
to do me any harm...

37:18.206 --> 37:20.206
and I start laughing, too.

37:22.406 --> 37:26.566
And then I see the look in her eyes.
Not of fear or anger.

37:26.646 --> 37:28.806
But of disgust...

37:30.446 --> 37:32.286
for what we are.

37:34.246 --> 37:35.446
Inhuman.

37:36.766 --> 37:37.726
A plague.

37:39.446 --> 37:42.286
And it's a look I've seen
many times since...

37:42.366 --> 37:44.726
in my own eyes.

37:49.326 --> 37:53.086
Then you're saying
that we can't change.

37:54.606 --> 37:58.926
That what we did in the past,
what we were,

37:59.006 --> 38:00.646
we'll always be those things.

38:03.446 --> 38:04.686
I don't believe that.

38:05.806 --> 38:07.926
And I don't think you do either.

38:12.126 --> 38:14.726
I have to tell them the truth...

38:16.446 --> 38:21.966
which is that you got into trouble
and I rescued you.

38:24.726 --> 38:27.566
I was very brave, of course.

38:27.646 --> 38:29.846
You, not so much.

38:31.486 --> 38:34.566
Maybe that will be enough to stop
them throwing me overboard.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.206
Why would they want to do that?

38:37.286 --> 38:41.326
It's thanks to me that we
can't go to Baruch.

38:41.406 --> 38:42.926
We NEED to run.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.406
We're hunted.

38:47.686 --> 38:49.166
Fugitives.

38:49.246 --> 38:51.806
And it's safer for us
to stay together.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.526
Yeah.

38:54.606 --> 38:57.406
Perhaps this was all meant to be.

38:57.486 --> 39:03.446
Fate. Destiny.
Bringing us all together.

39:04.966 --> 39:07.926
Do you really believe that?
No, not really.

39:09.566 --> 39:11.486
I just thought you'd like to hear it.

39:13.166 --> 39:17.926
Truth is, they do want to throw you
overboard.

39:20.206 --> 39:21.566
That's what I thought.

39:25.646 --> 39:26.886
Rip the city apart.

39:26.966 --> 39:29.246
Find Sinbad's family.

39:29.326 --> 39:32.726
Anyone who might know where he is.

39:32.806 --> 39:34.086
Wait.

40:07.366 --> 40:08.806
You.

40:08.886 --> 40:11.686
You know this Sinbad.

40:13.646 --> 40:15.086
Go!

40:17.566 --> 40:19.006
Is it true?

40:19.086 --> 40:20.086
I don't...

40:20.166 --> 40:21.566
The truth.

40:21.646 --> 40:24.006
When I was a child, his family...

40:24.086 --> 40:27.406
Bring me his family and
I will see you are rewarded

40:27.486 --> 40:29.486
beyond your wildest dreams.
