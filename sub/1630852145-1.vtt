WEBVTT

00:37.832 --> 00:39.901
To go to jail together!

00:41.904 --> 00:43.939
We didn't land
on Plymouth Rock.

00:43.973 --> 00:45.507
The rock landed on us.

00:55.617 --> 00:57.286
Drugs are menacing
our society.

00:59.522 --> 01:00.657
Just say no.

01:06.529 --> 01:07.831
I can't breath!

01:27.752 --> 01:31.422
What, what, what,
what, what now?

01:31.456 --> 01:33.192
What, what, what now?

01:35.794 --> 01:39.198
What now, what now,
what now, what now?

01:39.230 --> 01:40.065
What now?

01:42.433 --> 01:43.234
What now?

01:44.170 --> 01:46.605
What now, what now, fuck?

01:46.639 --> 01:50.509
What now, what now,
what now, what now?

01:57.382 --> 01:58.785
What, what, what?

02:00.020 --> 02:02.957
Why, why, why, why
did they do that?

02:05.025 --> 02:06.526
Why, why, why did they?

02:06.559 --> 02:08.461
Why, why, why did they?

02:08.495 --> 02:10.965
Why, why, why did they?

02:10.998 --> 02:12.700
Why did they fuckin' do that?

02:12.733 --> 02:13.566
What, why?

02:20.374 --> 02:21.209
What now?

02:22.144 --> 02:23.310
What now, why?

02:32.955 --> 02:33.790
What now?

02:50.406 --> 02:52.176
Ah shit, he picked up.

02:52.209 --> 02:53.677
Hey, you're still
alive, I guess.

02:53.710 --> 02:54.845
Why did you fucking do it?

02:54.878 --> 02:56.345
- Why?
- All right listen, calm down.

02:56.379 --> 02:58.447
- I wanna tell you something.
- Don't you know anything

02:58.481 --> 03:01.218
about negotiating with a
hostile fuckin' person?

03:01.251 --> 03:02.920
- Shut the fuck up.
- You never tell them

03:02.953 --> 03:05.256
- to fuckin' calm down.
- You done yet?

03:05.290 --> 03:06.958
- You're, you're, you're.
- I'm trying to tell

03:06.991 --> 03:08.293
- you something here.
- You're meant to deescalate

03:08.325 --> 03:09.560
the situation.

03:09.593 --> 03:11.062
Let 'em vent, let
'em get all the rage

03:11.095 --> 03:14.699
- off his fuckin' chest.
- Listen, Jesus!

03:14.732 --> 03:17.302
You fuckin', ain't my fault!

03:19.204 --> 03:21.307
None of this is my fault!

03:23.309 --> 03:25.077
Are you done?

03:25.110 --> 03:27.012
You still there?

03:27.046 --> 03:27.880
Hello?

03:28.747 --> 03:29.915
How did you get my number?

03:29.949 --> 03:31.851
Your buddy Quint
gave it to me.

03:31.884 --> 03:33.786
You fuckin' shot him.

03:33.819 --> 03:35.020
You fuckin' killed him.

03:35.054 --> 03:37.456
He didn't do nothing,
you fuckin' killed him.

03:37.489 --> 03:42.394
He was, he just, you
fuckin', you fuckin', fuck.

03:42.428 --> 03:44.563
Kid went for his
gun, what do you want?

03:44.597 --> 03:46.532
He went for his gun?

03:46.565 --> 03:48.601
Yes, he went for his fuckin' gun.

03:48.634 --> 03:49.769
Liar, fuckin' liar.

03:49.803 --> 03:51.503
Listen, listen, shut up.

03:51.537 --> 03:53.140
I need you to be
quiet for a second.

03:53.174 --> 03:54.809
- I need you to just listen.
- What?

03:54.842 --> 03:56.476
Do you hear that?

03:56.509 --> 03:57.577
No.

03:57.611 --> 04:00.047
You don't hear that?
You don't hear sirens?

04:00.081 --> 04:01.949
- What, I don't.
- Do you hear them or not?

04:01.983 --> 04:05.720
- Fuck this, so what?
- Those sirens are on your 12

04:05.753 --> 04:07.554
and your six and your
three and your nine

04:07.587 --> 04:09.057
- And if you don't what.
- What the fuck are

04:09.091 --> 04:10.325
- you talking about?
- That fuckin' means,

04:10.359 --> 04:13.461
it means you are
surrounded Junior.

04:13.494 --> 04:14.595
So as you can plainly see,

04:14.629 --> 04:16.331
it does not matter if I choose

04:16.365 --> 04:18.566
to deescalate the situation,

04:18.599 --> 04:20.601
or if I choose to
escalate the situation

04:20.635 --> 04:22.037
or if I choose to
fuck your mother

04:22.070 --> 04:23.739
and cum right on her ugly face,

04:23.773 --> 04:27.143
I have the high ground and
that means your ass is mine.

04:27.176 --> 04:29.212
So why don't you walk
on out the front door,

04:29.245 --> 04:30.813
drop your pants
around your ankles,

04:30.847 --> 04:33.515
bend over and then
beg me real nice

04:33.548 --> 04:35.318
to use a little lube?

04:36.786 --> 04:39.823
- I got nothing to lose.
- What?

04:39.857 --> 04:41.524
I said I ain't
got nothing to lose.

04:41.557 --> 04:42.960
Except for your life.

04:42.993 --> 04:45.062
If that's worth anything.

04:45.095 --> 04:47.898
Listen, go ahead and
tell me your name.

04:47.932 --> 04:49.632
Fuck you.

04:49.667 --> 04:50.868
That's my name.

04:50.901 --> 04:53.938
Okay, well
listen Mr. Fuck You.

04:53.971 --> 04:56.908
Mr. You, Fuck's
my Christian name.

04:59.543 --> 05:01.445
Ah, that's
funny as shit.

05:01.478 --> 05:02.681
You're a funny motherfucker.

05:02.714 --> 05:06.051
That's the, ah shit,
you just made my day.

05:08.787 --> 05:10.487
I'm going to tell
you a little secret.

05:10.521 --> 05:12.725
Your friend, the one
that got shot out there,

05:12.758 --> 05:14.260
he was an asshole.

05:14.293 --> 05:16.594
I mean, it doesn't matter
how well-spoken he is.

05:16.628 --> 05:19.165
He bored the living
shit out of all of us

05:19.198 --> 05:21.834
with all of his demands,
this, that and the other.

05:21.867 --> 05:24.904
He came here, you both
came here thinking what?

05:24.937 --> 05:27.708
You were going to find
a yachts, private jets,

05:27.741 --> 05:29.676
stacks of cash, 72 virgins.

05:29.710 --> 05:33.612
What did you think happened
when we got to now?

05:35.382 --> 05:36.950
Have you ever seen any movies?

05:36.984 --> 05:39.286
The good guys, which is me,

05:39.319 --> 05:43.256
we always lie to you and
the bad guys, which is you,

05:43.290 --> 05:46.127
you always end up
caught or dead.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.397
- Fuck you.
- I don't give a fuck which.

05:53.067 --> 05:54.068
Hey Mr. You?

05:55.470 --> 05:57.939
I think this fuckin' kid just
threw me across the room.

05:57.972 --> 06:00.943
Hey, I got something you're
going to want to hear.

06:00.976 --> 06:03.479
Come here, I got a
little secret for you.

06:03.511 --> 06:07.182
Your friend, the asshole,
he's still alive.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.151
That's right.

06:10.219 --> 06:12.654
Well, I mean,
probably only barely,

06:12.688 --> 06:15.190
you get shot that many times
you don't have real good odds,

06:15.224 --> 06:18.428
but for right now he is a
regular Curtis 50 cent jack.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.063
You can meet him in the club.

06:20.096 --> 06:21.364
That's where it's going down.

06:21.398 --> 06:23.433
- Where is he?
- He's in a hospital,

06:23.466 --> 06:24.667
you dumb shit.

06:24.701 --> 06:26.535
They're trying to keep
him alive right now.

06:26.568 --> 06:29.672
And I promise you, if
you come out right now,

06:29.706 --> 06:31.207
I will take you to go see him.

06:31.241 --> 06:32.676
We'll even ride together.

06:32.710 --> 06:35.780
I will sit in the back fuckin'
seat and hold your hand.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.482
And if you talk real nice to me.

06:40.484 --> 06:45.489
Your call has been
forwarded to an automatic.

06:47.590 --> 06:48.393
Hello?

06:48.427 --> 06:49.227
Lisa?

06:49.261 --> 06:50.062
Yeah?

06:50.095 --> 06:51.296
He's been shot.

06:51.329 --> 06:53.899
- I told you guys not to do it.
- Hold up.

06:53.932 --> 06:56.168
I need you to get
your ass on the phone

06:56.201 --> 06:57.969
and call local hospitals.

06:58.003 --> 06:59.337
Find out if he's, if
he's alive or not.

06:59.371 --> 07:00.739
- You can't do that?
- I called 'em already

07:00.772 --> 07:01.639
but it went straight
to voicemail.

07:01.673 --> 07:03.008
You called him?

07:03.041 --> 07:05.311
Of course it went to
voicemail, he's shot, you saw.

07:05.344 --> 07:07.280
Who you callin' next, God?

07:07.313 --> 07:12.151
Will you do this one small
fuckin' thing for me, please?

07:13.386 --> 07:14.954
He's your fuckin' friend.

07:14.987 --> 07:16.456
Fine.

07:16.489 --> 07:19.058
Hey wait a minute, how is
he shot and you're fine?

07:19.092 --> 07:19.993
That don't.

07:21.195 --> 07:22.129
Are you a cop?

07:22.162 --> 07:23.831
No, I'm not a fuckin' cop.

07:23.864 --> 07:26.300
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

07:26.333 --> 07:28.235
What, why the fuck would
I fuckin' be calling you?

07:28.268 --> 07:30.170
- All right, all right.
- Talk sense, god damn.

07:30.204 --> 07:32.906
I gotta fuckin'
ask, what the hell?

07:32.940 --> 07:36.010
Did you at least get the money?

07:36.044 --> 07:37.145
Are you kidding me?

07:37.178 --> 07:38.413
What?

07:38.446 --> 07:39.646
You went in there
to get the money,

07:39.681 --> 07:41.182
now did you get
any fuckin' money?

07:41.216 --> 07:42.851
Or has the whole thing been
a waste of everyone's time.

07:42.884 --> 07:44.552
- Make the fuckin' call.
- Fuck you.

07:44.586 --> 07:45.987
Call me back asap,
all right, bye bye.

07:46.020 --> 07:47.288
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

07:54.063 --> 07:55.531
Why are you still here?

07:55.564 --> 07:59.735
When you ran back in,
you dragged me with you.

07:59.768 --> 08:01.103
- I did?
- Yeah.

08:02.104 --> 08:04.373
You dragged me by the hair.

08:07.176 --> 08:08.011
So what?

08:08.979 --> 08:09.813
It hurt.

08:12.382 --> 08:14.718
You're alive, be grateful.

08:19.022 --> 08:21.925
You don't remember me, do you?

08:21.958 --> 08:24.529
From before all of this?

08:24.562 --> 08:28.132
Anyway, your friend,
he's definitely alive.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.202
Saw his face when
he hit the floor.

08:31.235 --> 08:33.404
He was in pain, but alive.

08:35.873 --> 08:37.208
I felt helpless.

08:38.242 --> 08:39.177
Helpless?

08:40.112 --> 08:41.246
You are helpless.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.081
What are you, 12?

08:43.115 --> 08:45.517
- I'm 16.
- What's a 16 year old doing

08:45.551 --> 08:46.385
in a bank?

08:48.587 --> 08:50.422
You gonna let me go?

08:53.392 --> 08:56.262
I promise I won't tell
the police your real name.

08:56.296 --> 08:58.364
You don't know my name.

08:59.499 --> 09:02.001
Yeah, you're right, I don't.

09:05.805 --> 09:07.640
How do you know my name?

09:07.675 --> 09:08.474
I don't.

09:08.508 --> 09:10.009
Don't lie to me.

09:11.044 --> 09:12.279
I just made that up.

09:12.313 --> 09:13.814
You said you knew
my name, tell me how.

09:13.847 --> 09:16.350
I don't know
anything, I promise.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.689
Yeah?

09:20.721 --> 09:21.522
He's alive.

09:21.555 --> 09:22.723
You 100% sure.

09:22.756 --> 09:24.291
Yes, but
it's not looking good.

09:24.325 --> 09:26.026
Listen, I need
a way out of this.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.261
Out of?

09:27.294 --> 09:28.363
The bank.

09:28.396 --> 09:29.631
What else?

09:29.665 --> 09:30.899
Why don't
you call God back?

09:30.932 --> 09:33.501
- What?
- Listen, I can't help you.

09:33.535 --> 09:34.704
I just saw on the news.

09:34.736 --> 09:35.671
You're surrounded,
you're fucked.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.973
You gave me your number.

09:38.006 --> 09:39.541
You said you fixed shit, Lisa.

09:39.574 --> 09:41.910
You said anything
go wrong, call me.

09:41.943 --> 09:43.512
Okay, let me
just come down there

09:43.546 --> 09:45.147
and dig you a tunnel.

09:45.181 --> 09:47.550
Can you at least go
to the fuckin' hospital

09:47.583 --> 09:48.618
to see if he pulls through?

09:48.651 --> 09:49.485
Fuck no, fuck no.

09:49.518 --> 09:50.319
Come on.

09:50.353 --> 09:51.320
You crazy?

09:51.354 --> 09:52.855
- Fuck no.
- Please.

09:54.624 --> 09:57.493
- I want my cut.
- A cut of zero?

09:57.526 --> 10:00.197
- Bye Felicia.
- Hold up!

10:01.932 --> 10:06.903
If I make it out of this, there
may be some loot involved.

10:06.937 --> 10:09.106
That's a big fuckin' if.

10:10.907 --> 10:12.409
I got a hostage.

10:14.511 --> 10:15.345
A girl.

10:16.514 --> 10:17.815
Really?

10:18.684 --> 10:19.584
I want 10 percent.

10:19.617 --> 10:21.019
For going to the hospital?

10:21.052 --> 10:22.153
Damn right.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.422
- Fuck that.
- Okay, bye!

10:24.455 --> 10:25.290
Hold up.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.593
Fine.

10:30.895 --> 10:32.798
How are you going to
pay her with no money?

10:32.831 --> 10:34.133
What?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.067
I've got money.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.402
No, you left the money outside

10:36.435 --> 10:39.505
when you dragged me in here.

10:39.538 --> 10:43.409
I mean you could always
rob the bank again.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.611
I think I see some money
on the floor inside

10:45.644 --> 10:47.414
that area over there.

10:48.783 --> 10:53.520
But if you leave this
office, they might shoot you.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.791
I think they got
snipers out there too.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.293
You gonna kill me?

11:30.459 --> 11:32.795
That's his blood, not yours.

11:48.478 --> 11:49.312
Stop?

12:10.969 --> 12:12.270
Oh fuck, fuck,

12:13.739 --> 12:15.907
why'd they fuckin' do that?

12:36.595 --> 12:38.631
Mr. You, hey bud,

12:38.664 --> 12:40.934
listen, I gotta apologise.

12:40.967 --> 12:42.436
I was a little rough
on you earlier.

12:42.469 --> 12:45.773
And I got this toxic
masculine something

12:45.807 --> 12:47.307
that my therapist is on about.

12:47.340 --> 12:49.844
Wife says I'm just too
fuckin' aggressive,

12:49.877 --> 12:51.445
but you wanna know the bullshit?

12:51.478 --> 12:53.881
My daughter, she
fuckin' loves it.

12:53.915 --> 12:54.816
Are you kiddin'?

12:54.849 --> 12:55.751
She goes out to the playground,

12:55.784 --> 12:56.685
she's like, don't mess with me,

12:56.718 --> 12:58.519
my dad will go God mode on you.

13:00.021 --> 13:02.423
The best, you got kids, man?

13:02.457 --> 13:03.658
Or wait no, I guess
you probably don't.

13:03.692 --> 13:04.625
You're too young, right?

13:04.659 --> 13:06.327
What are you, like 25, 26, 28?

13:06.360 --> 13:07.628
Something like that?

13:07.662 --> 13:09.397
I spent all day talking
to your god damn friend.

13:09.430 --> 13:10.998
I don't know you yet.

13:11.032 --> 13:13.870
I mean, that guy was, you know,

13:13.903 --> 13:17.005
I was about to say I liked
him, but I don't know why

13:17.039 --> 13:18.540
I would say that, I
fuckin' hated him.

13:18.574 --> 13:20.008
He was an asshole.

13:20.042 --> 13:23.545
Anybody who kidnaps 12 people
is an asshole, all right?

13:23.579 --> 13:26.648
But I want us to get to
know each other asshole.

13:26.683 --> 13:28.384
I am Aaron.

13:28.418 --> 13:29.986
I am your crisis negotiator.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.690
I'm not like those guys out
there that shot your friend.

13:32.723 --> 13:34.023
They spend all
day holding a gun.

13:34.057 --> 13:35.425
They get all itchy.

13:35.458 --> 13:36.794
They want to shoot
something and then go home

13:36.827 --> 13:38.796
and fuck their wives
missionary style.

13:38.829 --> 13:40.163
I am the talker.

13:41.564 --> 13:43.935
I'm the one who's your
friend here, okay?

13:43.969 --> 13:45.402
I'm not your friend.

13:45.436 --> 13:47.104
Sorry, what was that?

13:47.137 --> 13:49.106
I said I'm not your friend.

13:49.139 --> 13:51.108
All right, fair,
you know what?

13:51.141 --> 13:53.544
That's still progress,
we're communicating now.

13:53.577 --> 13:56.080
All right, so how old are you?

13:59.116 --> 14:00.820
C'mon man, this is
not communicating.

14:00.853 --> 14:01.787
You're not answering me.

14:01.821 --> 14:02.722
You got to give me something.

14:02.755 --> 14:03.890
What's your favourite colour?

14:03.923 --> 14:05.123
What's your favourite
day of the week?

14:05.156 --> 14:06.525
Do you like a reach
around in the shower?

14:06.558 --> 14:07.392
The fuck?

14:10.930 --> 14:12.732
You know, I don't have time for this.
You got 10 minutes.

14:12.765 --> 14:14.165
You got fuckin' 10
minutes before I sick

14:14.199 --> 14:15.635
these god damn wild
animals in there

14:15.668 --> 14:17.838
and they shoot you dead, just
like your fuckin' friend.

14:17.871 --> 14:20.139
- So end this shit.
- If he dies, I'm gonna kill her.

14:20.172 --> 14:21.808
We can go home.

14:21.842 --> 14:22.675
Her?

14:24.878 --> 14:26.013
What do you mean her?

14:26.045 --> 14:29.315
What her are you
talkin' about here, bud?

14:29.348 --> 14:30.751
Is there a girl
in there with you?

14:30.784 --> 14:33.120
Nah, that can't be right,
we did a headcount.

14:33.153 --> 14:34.087
Will you answer my
fuckin' question?

14:34.121 --> 14:36.390
How old is your daughter?

14:37.624 --> 14:39.727
She's 14.

14:39.761 --> 14:42.462
Girl in here ain't much older.

14:46.266 --> 14:49.103
If he dies, I'm
going to kill her.

15:05.387 --> 15:07.791
Why'd you always leave?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.893
All things come to an end.

15:09.926 --> 15:11.027
Right.

15:11.061 --> 15:11.895
You sad?

15:14.064 --> 15:14.864
No.

15:16.066 --> 15:19.770
Don't look at my ass
when I get my clothes.

15:30.748 --> 15:33.183
What's up with the picture?

15:35.954 --> 15:38.556
That is a '70 to '75 BMW CSL.

15:41.659 --> 15:44.763
Launched the M brand, vintage.

15:44.796 --> 15:46.297
Set you back 135K.

15:48.132 --> 15:50.534
I'm saving up, gonna get one.

15:52.437 --> 15:53.338
How's that going for you,

15:53.372 --> 15:55.507
considering you just got fired?

15:55.540 --> 15:57.409
How do you get sacked
from a fuckin' car garage?

15:57.442 --> 15:58.845
I had that job for you.

15:58.878 --> 16:01.114
Asshole called
me stupid, I don't.

16:01.146 --> 16:02.147
Calm down.

16:04.984 --> 16:06.284
I've got a couple G's saved.

16:06.318 --> 16:09.155
Oh, only another
133,000 to go.

16:19.632 --> 16:22.836
You know, you're in violation
of your parole right?

16:22.870 --> 16:24.105
Cause I'm fuckin' you?

16:24.139 --> 16:26.306
Because you have no job.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.912
Can't you just pretend
that I do have a job?

16:30.945 --> 16:33.014
- I know a guy.
- A guy?

16:33.048 --> 16:36.051
A guy, needs a fourth man.

16:36.084 --> 16:37.317
Collection?

16:37.351 --> 16:38.519
Collection.

16:38.552 --> 16:41.090
What collection
job needs four men?

16:41.123 --> 16:41.957
Robbery.

16:43.224 --> 16:45.961
Never done a robbery before.

16:45.995 --> 16:47.262
What's the difference?

16:47.295 --> 16:49.497
Petty crime, segway.

16:49.531 --> 16:52.667
May as well elevate yourself.

16:52.702 --> 16:55.706
Niv Clock, him and his crew
have done about 14 stickups,

16:55.739 --> 16:57.007
he's slick.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.507
10 years ago, he
knocks off a jewellers,

16:58.541 --> 17:01.644
takes home 500+, no trace.

17:01.677 --> 17:04.081
Then he got caught on
some small charges,

17:04.114 --> 17:05.514
they made an example out of him.

17:05.548 --> 17:09.052
Gave him four, he's a
little bit jaded now maybe.

17:09.086 --> 17:11.488
Lost his spark a little.

17:11.521 --> 17:13.690
But he's all to the good.

17:16.894 --> 17:18.462
All right.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.264
You, this is, this
is a big jump.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.773
I mean, robbery.

17:27.806 --> 17:31.043
We even get you
enough to score that.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.982
When I get it, maybe we
go someplace, just drive.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.183
Like in the movies?

17:38.217 --> 17:40.152
Like in the movies, yeah.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.320
I'm your fuckin'
parole officer,

17:42.353 --> 17:44.623
we're just fucking.

17:44.656 --> 17:49.095
Take your mum somewhere
nice with the money.

17:49.129 --> 17:51.197
She died when I was three.

17:51.231 --> 17:52.664
Awkward.

17:52.699 --> 17:55.835
That brought the mood down
and for that, I'm very sorry.

17:55.869 --> 17:57.302
Don't be late to the meeting.

17:57.336 --> 18:00.241
He's got a thing
about punctuality.

18:42.985 --> 18:43.820
Madison.

18:45.087 --> 18:46.856
That's my name.

18:46.889 --> 18:49.492
So when you kill me,
you killed Madison.

18:49.525 --> 18:50.693
If.

18:50.727 --> 18:52.361
You're gonna kill
me, I can tell.

18:52.395 --> 18:55.132
You want something to
take everything out on

18:55.165 --> 18:57.667
and I'm right in front of you.

19:00.670 --> 19:01.872
So when do I get
Stockholm syndrome?

19:01.905 --> 19:03.407
What?

19:03.440 --> 19:04.909
- You know, Stockholm syndrome, it's where the hostage.
- I know what it is.

19:04.943 --> 19:05.743
Shut up a minute.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.444
I'm trying to think.

19:14.285 --> 19:15.787
He went for his gun.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.223
Liars, they're fuckin' liars.

19:18.256 --> 19:20.425
I got temper problem,
then why the fuck you

19:20.458 --> 19:22.393
in the fuckin' job for?

19:23.561 --> 19:27.199
Wrong profession for a
fuckin' temper problem.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.035
He did.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.339
- What?
- Nothing.

19:33.371 --> 19:35.641
Are you talking about the gun?

19:35.674 --> 19:38.712
He didn't go for
his fuckin' gun.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.980
He reached into his jacket.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.513
So, so what?

19:41.547 --> 19:42.648
You, you don't just kill a guy.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.515
You don't.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.186
That's not how life works.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.386
Yeah, totally.

19:47.419 --> 19:50.223
No, black lives
matter and all that.

19:52.226 --> 19:53.060
What?

20:15.918 --> 20:16.818
I'm hungry.

20:18.887 --> 20:20.621
We could order pizza.

20:22.291 --> 20:24.127
You know, I bet
you're a pineapple

20:24.160 --> 20:26.896
on your pizza kind
of guy, right?

20:38.909 --> 20:40.443
Hello?

20:40.476 --> 20:43.881
Yes, I'd like to order
a few pizzas please.

20:43.914 --> 20:48.152
Yeah, deliver it to
the hostage situation.

20:48.185 --> 20:50.620
Yes, you know the bank thing.

20:52.122 --> 20:56.227
Yeah, so I'll take
the vegetable delight.

20:56.261 --> 20:57.996
Yeah and my man here,

20:59.331 --> 21:02.334
yeah, he'll take extra
pineapple on his meaty paradise.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.168
Yes, that's right.

21:03.201 --> 21:04.936
Plenty of pineapple.

21:05.804 --> 21:07.571
Yeah, that's the one.

21:07.604 --> 21:09.140
30 minutes or it's free, right?

21:09.174 --> 21:09.975
Great.

21:15.513 --> 21:18.284
Who hangs up the phone
like that anymore?

21:18.317 --> 21:21.120
- Are you even old enough to hang up the phone like that?
- Do you ever shut up?

21:26.125 --> 21:29.062
You asked me what
I was doing here

21:29.096 --> 21:31.630
and I don't even know.

21:31.664 --> 21:32.899
I don't even care.

21:32.933 --> 21:36.702
You see, I came here
to, well I'm a singer.

21:36.737 --> 21:38.872
I'm actually kinda famous,

21:38.905 --> 21:40.841
I released a couple
of singles last year.

21:40.874 --> 21:41.875
Nothing since though.

21:41.908 --> 21:43.144
My dad opened up an account

21:43.177 --> 21:45.679
here where he
keeps all my money.

21:45.713 --> 21:49.283
Fact is I don't like him
and he has all my money.

21:49.317 --> 21:51.919
So I wanted to see if I could
get it back and run away.

21:51.953 --> 21:53.287
I don't care, I don't care!

21:53.321 --> 21:54.621
- And all of a sudden.
- I don't care!

21:54.654 --> 21:56.324
Blazing guns.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.994
They wouldn't have
given you the money.

21:59.028 --> 22:00.996
It's your dad's account.

22:02.331 --> 22:04.967
Maybe, guess we'll never know.

22:06.735 --> 22:07.870
What do you?

22:09.505 --> 22:10.506
What he do to you do?

22:10.538 --> 22:11.874
Hm, thought you didn't care.

22:11.907 --> 22:13.541
I'm being polite.

22:13.574 --> 22:16.146
I don't want to talk about it.

22:19.215 --> 22:20.784
- He rape you?
- No.

22:37.902 --> 22:39.804
I need to go to the bathroom.

22:39.837 --> 22:41.571
It's just over there.

22:41.604 --> 22:44.008
I can alone, I won't run.

22:44.041 --> 22:45.843
I won't be long, I'm just gonna.

22:45.876 --> 22:47.312
Fine, fine, go!

22:50.082 --> 22:50.882
Hurry up.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.184
Yeah, I will.

23:22.216 --> 23:25.319
Got me waiting in
here like a motherfucka.

23:25.352 --> 23:26.353
Sorry man.

23:29.089 --> 23:30.656
Saida told me
you was reliable.

23:30.690 --> 23:31.492
I am reliable.

23:31.525 --> 23:33.193
Then why you late?

23:34.228 --> 23:35.130
It's not my fault.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.398
See, let me ask you something.

23:37.432 --> 23:38.366
- Sure.
- Why you want

23:38.399 --> 23:39.334
- to do this shit?
- What?

23:39.367 --> 23:40.435
- Nigga, you deaf?
- No.

23:40.468 --> 23:42.437
- So you heard me?
- Yeah.

23:44.705 --> 23:45.639
To get rich.

23:45.672 --> 23:47.208
Nigga, is that a question?

23:47.242 --> 23:48.675
I guess I phrased it like one.

23:48.709 --> 23:51.679
Listen, if you don't know
why you doing this shit,

23:51.713 --> 23:55.217
then you need to get
the fuck out the car.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.456
You still here.

24:01.891 --> 24:05.494
I thought I told you to
get the fuck out the car.

24:14.037 --> 24:17.274
You see those tower
blocks over there?

24:21.545 --> 24:25.783
Barely, too comfortable
in this position to look.

24:28.586 --> 24:30.721
Last week a girl about
20 or something got raped

24:30.755 --> 24:32.089
in the elevator.

24:34.458 --> 24:38.029
Police came by, asked
a couple of questions

24:38.062 --> 24:40.499
to a couple people then left.

24:41.699 --> 24:44.570
No follow ups, no
further inquiries.

24:47.306 --> 24:49.608
They knew people
weren't finna talk.

24:49.641 --> 24:53.779
Now other weeks, some cop
didn't stick to the script.

24:53.812 --> 24:57.716
Choked the boy so hard,
his windpipe broke,

24:57.750 --> 24:59.018
died instantly.

25:01.020 --> 25:03.356
Don't get me wrong.

25:03.389 --> 25:07.994
The kid was a street rat,
but he didn't deserve to die.

25:14.068 --> 25:17.271
There were some
protests, some backlash,

25:17.304 --> 25:19.873
but as usual, it don't do shit.

25:21.342 --> 25:23.944
And I'm sitting here staring
at those same tower blocks,

25:23.978 --> 25:24.812
same shit.

25:30.485 --> 25:33.221
And I wanna stay
and help fix it.

25:33.255 --> 25:34.356
Really, I do.

25:39.127 --> 25:39.961
I did.

25:44.300 --> 25:49.071
Man, all I really want is to
buy a '70 to '75 BMW CSL 3.0

25:53.042 --> 25:55.144
and drive the fuck
away from here forever.

25:55.177 --> 26:00.050
Well, god damn, you a deep
talking motherfucker, huh?

26:00.083 --> 26:02.552
Got Malcolm X up in this bitch.

26:02.586 --> 26:04.388
- We good?
- That seemed rehearse.

26:04.421 --> 26:05.322
- You a cop?
- No.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.690
Kind of work you done before?

26:06.723 --> 26:07.891
Call centre, mechanic.

26:07.924 --> 26:09.593
- No nigga, work.
- Not much.

26:09.626 --> 26:11.495
I didn't ask how
much, I asked what kind.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.529
You gon' have to get smart.

26:12.562 --> 26:13.563
I am smart.

26:13.597 --> 26:15.768
Then answer the question.

26:17.268 --> 26:19.270
A bit of fraud,
shoplifting, collection,

26:19.304 --> 26:20.538
nothing heavy, man.

26:20.571 --> 26:21.740
I did a six month
stint, got caught.

26:21.774 --> 26:22.640
Ever killed a man?

26:22.674 --> 26:23.776
- No.
- Ever killed a woman?

26:23.808 --> 26:25.009
- No.
- Nigga, you a cop?

26:25.043 --> 26:28.680
No, I'm not a
fuckin' cop, all right?

26:28.713 --> 26:30.616
That's twice I asked.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.259
- Saida your PO?
- Yep.

26:42.027 --> 26:44.697
She was mine previous.

26:44.731 --> 26:46.065
She nice, right?

26:47.033 --> 26:47.867
Yep.

26:49.269 --> 26:51.371
That was an uncanny yeah.

26:51.404 --> 26:52.740
You fuckin' her?

26:53.640 --> 26:54.641
- No.
- Liar.

26:57.243 --> 26:59.179
You got a girl, kids?

27:01.214 --> 27:04.385
I'm a career car,
career first, you?

27:05.853 --> 27:10.224
No man, I was an orphan,
ain't got no kids of my own.

27:12.828 --> 27:14.730
How was your time inside?

27:14.763 --> 27:17.098
Was it a nice time,
six months, right?

27:17.131 --> 27:18.299
Easy.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.102
Kept my head down.

27:20.135 --> 27:23.238
Made zero friends,
made zero enemies.

27:24.439 --> 27:28.243
Six months, that's a
kindergarten stick.

27:28.276 --> 27:31.113
You seen that film,
Straight Time?

27:32.481 --> 27:33.850
Dustin Hoffman?

27:34.752 --> 27:35.585
Yeah.

27:37.019 --> 27:38.856
I love that scene when he
hits his parole officer

27:38.888 --> 27:40.123
in the car.

27:40.156 --> 27:42.358
Look at me sucker, you
busted me for nothing!

27:43.559 --> 27:45.194
I love that, man.

27:45.228 --> 27:49.132
That's all I did as a
kid, man, watch movies.

27:50.567 --> 27:53.337
My dad, he made
me watch Robocop.

27:55.606 --> 27:57.374
It'll toughen you up.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.745
Look at me now.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.045
Hate cops.

28:02.079 --> 28:04.816
I watched that
shit about 400 times.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.285
I buy that shit for a dollar.

28:08.854 --> 28:09.921
Classic, man.

28:12.357 --> 28:16.327
Listen here, I'm gon'
have to be your Fagin

28:16.361 --> 28:18.329
since you're a rook.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.065
Four things you need for
the art of the steal.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.870
The set up, where
you gon' hit or what.

28:23.904 --> 28:26.238
Swell mob, two to four, no more.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.875
Guns, loaded or
blanks, doesn't matter.

28:28.909 --> 28:31.243
People see guns, they
automatically think death,

28:31.277 --> 28:32.711
makes 'em placid.

28:32.746 --> 28:35.147
The getaway call, in,
out, no fuckin' around.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.183
You fuck around, you either
going to the big house

28:37.216 --> 28:39.219
or gettin' lit up.

28:39.252 --> 28:40.487
Right.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.189
And don't believe them
films you see neither.

28:42.222 --> 28:43.990
All right, it's
not about the job.

28:44.024 --> 28:45.692
It's about the getaway.

28:45.725 --> 28:50.730
Most yardbirds say, 98%
actually robbed the bank itself.

28:51.465 --> 28:52.934
The getaway, though.

28:52.966 --> 28:54.134
You got a gun?

28:56.772 --> 28:58.473
You gon' need a gun.

28:58.506 --> 29:01.175
Where am I going to get a gun?

29:01.209 --> 29:04.512
Why don't you ask that parole
officer you ain't fuckin?

29:04.545 --> 29:06.080
She'll hook us up.

29:06.113 --> 29:09.250
She got a beak in
all the oceans.

29:09.283 --> 29:11.620
I'd normally ask my girl, Lisa.

29:11.653 --> 29:14.022
Her normal connect's doin' time.

29:14.056 --> 29:14.858
Yo girl?

29:17.927 --> 29:21.697
It's an expression,
told you, career first.

29:28.806 --> 29:32.542
What you know about Saida,
like, really though?

29:32.575 --> 29:35.512
Not much, she's
my PO, that's it.

29:37.146 --> 29:40.450
I heard she killed
a young kid, about 11.

29:49.026 --> 29:49.928
Bullshit.

29:52.563 --> 29:55.834
In this industry, you gotta
make a name for yourself.

29:55.867 --> 29:57.701
Kid was pedalling
merchandise for her.

29:57.735 --> 30:00.071
She found out he was keep.

30:00.105 --> 30:01.640
Shot him dead.

30:01.673 --> 30:05.076
Got herself a rep, no
one fucks with her.

30:07.279 --> 30:08.179
For real?

30:13.019 --> 30:14.755
Would you kill a kid?

30:18.057 --> 30:19.492
If I got gotta.

30:24.798 --> 30:29.201
Little free advice, this
shit in the bank goes wrong,

30:30.637 --> 30:33.775
you're probably gon' have
to kill somebody to get out.

30:33.808 --> 30:35.642
Security guard, woman,

30:38.712 --> 30:40.113
maybe even a kid.

30:41.816 --> 30:42.917
Don't flinch.

30:47.121 --> 30:49.557
So you're fuckin' her, right?

30:53.561 --> 30:55.430
The midnight special.

30:56.497 --> 30:57.933
This place is open at midnight?

30:57.967 --> 30:59.167
24 hours.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.170
Pancakes and
waffles, sounds good.

31:03.372 --> 31:06.308
Here, them bonafide
thick pancakes too,

31:06.342 --> 31:08.845
not that thin French shit.

31:08.878 --> 31:10.847
Only untoward thing
about this garbage joint

31:10.880 --> 31:12.314
is the service.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.483
Can't never get a waiter.

31:15.919 --> 31:17.686
I normally walk
out without payin'.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.056
Normally?

31:19.090 --> 31:20.690
Like more than once?

31:20.724 --> 31:24.762
I come back every time
and they don't even realise.

31:24.795 --> 31:27.330
Ever exited a place
without payin' before?

31:27.364 --> 31:28.198
No.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.167
Well?

31:32.702 --> 31:33.536
What?

31:35.373 --> 31:36.207
Now?

31:37.341 --> 31:39.543
You wanna be a
thief, Oliver Twist?

31:42.848 --> 31:43.681
I'm going.

31:45.117 --> 31:46.617
Oh, come on man.

32:18.819 --> 32:20.353
Hey there, Mr. You,

32:20.386 --> 32:23.024
it is Aaron, your friendly
hostage negotiator.

32:23.058 --> 32:27.327
And I just learned that you do
in fact have a girl in there.

32:27.361 --> 32:29.831
She is a young
singer and as such,

32:29.864 --> 32:31.331
I am authorised to offer you

32:31.365 --> 32:33.434
a cosy two years sentence.

32:33.467 --> 32:35.335
- No, no, no.
- Two year deal if you just

32:35.369 --> 32:36.537
- walk out.
- Fuck that!

32:36.570 --> 32:38.039
Don't try and negotiate
with me now, man.

32:38.073 --> 32:40.910
What happened to bustin' in
here and killin' me, huh?

32:40.943 --> 32:42.510
Curtis Jackson my
way out of here.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.412
Well, I have a temper,
I told you that too.

32:44.446 --> 32:46.182
Well maybe you're in the
wrong fuckin' profession.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.649
Yeah, maybe I am,

32:47.682 --> 32:49.852
but I'm the best option you got
and I'm pretty fuckin' good.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.286
- Pretty good?
- Yes.

32:51.319 --> 32:53.321
You're about to be
responsible for the death

32:53.354 --> 32:56.692
of a teenage girl,
you okay with that?

32:56.726 --> 32:57.961
Hey you listen,

32:57.994 --> 32:59.361
I have been doing
this for 12 years

32:59.395 --> 33:01.430
and I have never lost
a hostage on my watch.

33:01.464 --> 33:03.532
I have a record to protect.

33:03.566 --> 33:06.169
Looks to me like
your record's fucked.

33:06.203 --> 33:07.403
Is that why you
came down here?

33:07.436 --> 33:09.705
- Shut the fuck up!
- Is that why you came down here?

33:09.739 --> 33:11.742
Did you come here
to be a murderer?

33:11.776 --> 33:14.478
I thought you came here
to rob a bank, come on.

33:14.511 --> 33:18.149
Do you really want to
kill a little girl, huh?

33:18.182 --> 33:19.817
Do you want that
on your conscience?

33:19.851 --> 33:22.519
Is that why you came here today?

33:23.888 --> 33:25.089
Jesus Christ, like talkin'
to my fuckin' wife.

33:25.123 --> 33:27.860
- '70 to '75 BMW CSL 3.0.
- What?

33:29.161 --> 33:31.797
That's what I want,
waiting for me outside

33:31.830 --> 33:33.731
and I don't want anyone
within two miles of the bank.

33:33.766 --> 33:35.033
Two miles
isn't possible.

33:35.067 --> 33:36.501
- Two miles!
- Two miles is impossible.

33:36.534 --> 33:38.402
The car waiting for me
there, I'll leave the girl,

33:38.436 --> 33:42.274
get in and drive off and that's
a what do they call that?

33:42.307 --> 33:43.509
Non-negotiable.

33:43.542 --> 33:44.710
Okay, all right.

33:44.743 --> 33:46.512
But I'm going to
need proof of life.

33:46.545 --> 33:47.847
I need to hear her voice.

33:47.881 --> 33:49.481
If you're going to leave the
girl, I need to know she's alive.

33:49.515 --> 33:51.416
Can you do that for me?

33:52.551 --> 33:53.385
Can you?

33:57.924 --> 33:59.226
Yeah, yeah I have?

33:59.260 --> 34:00.460
What the fuck?

34:00.493 --> 34:01.561
Who was that you
were talking to?

34:01.594 --> 34:02.662
- No one.
- Who was that?

34:02.695 --> 34:03.798
I wasn't talking to anyone!

34:03.831 --> 34:05.532
Ah stop, you're hurting me!

34:05.565 --> 34:07.333
Let go of me, let go!

34:09.335 --> 34:11.038
Is that, is that her?

34:11.071 --> 34:13.941
Hey, wait, what's
going on in there?

34:13.974 --> 34:16.343
What's on the other,
can you hear me?

34:16.377 --> 34:17.711
Can you hear me?

34:19.114 --> 34:20.614
God damn it.

34:39.668 --> 34:42.370
Whoa, whoa, wait
a fuckin' second.

34:42.404 --> 34:44.073
You're gonna tell me
that Nic Cage prime

34:44.106 --> 34:46.210
is better than Johnny
Depp in his prime?

34:46.243 --> 34:47.177
Fuck yeah.

34:47.211 --> 34:48.678
No fuckin' way.

34:48.711 --> 34:51.747
Edward Scissorhands, Fear
and Loathing, Dead Man,

34:51.782 --> 34:55.018
fuckin' Ed Wood, Ed
Wood motherfucker.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.287
How are you gonna tell me
Nicholas Cage beats any

34:57.321 --> 34:58.288
of those fuckin' movies?

34:58.322 --> 34:59.223
Back me up man.

34:59.256 --> 35:00.756
I fuckin' can't.

35:02.193 --> 35:03.660
So wait, you don't fuck
with Leaving Las Vegas?

35:03.694 --> 35:04.628
- No.
- You don't fuck

35:04.661 --> 35:05.830
with Face-Off?

35:07.031 --> 35:08.398
You don't with some
Bad Lieutenant?

35:08.432 --> 35:10.235
What the fuck are
you talking about?

35:10.268 --> 35:12.203
You're talking about two
different fuckin' things here.

35:12.237 --> 35:13.503
How is that even the same thing?

35:13.537 --> 35:14.973
It's chalk and cheese.

35:15.006 --> 35:16.908
- What?
- I come to you with prime,

35:16.941 --> 35:18.878
prime fuckin' rib
and I say to you,

35:18.911 --> 35:20.478
show me what you got
and what do you do?

35:20.511 --> 35:22.147
You bring me fuckin' fast food.

35:22.181 --> 35:23.481
You show me fuckin'
burgers, man.

35:23.514 --> 35:25.717
Fries, fuckin' milkshake.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.853
What the fuck is
he talking about?

35:27.887 --> 35:29.788
Wait, Nath, back me up,

35:30.990 --> 35:33.792
Nath, back me the
fuck up, come on.

35:33.826 --> 35:35.394
- I mean.
- Come on.

35:38.064 --> 35:39.766
I fuck with some Nic Cage.

35:39.799 --> 35:40.733
Dude, thank you.

35:40.767 --> 35:42.068
For sure, he talented.

35:42.102 --> 35:43.636
Get the fuck outta
here, talented?

35:43.669 --> 35:45.238
What the fuck are you?

35:45.272 --> 35:49.541
However, however, I must
contest with you Stally,

35:50.644 --> 35:52.712
and I show you
fair favour for it.

35:52.746 --> 35:56.483
He indeed, humbly
served your platter,

35:56.516 --> 35:58.352
some steak and yo ass,

35:59.854 --> 36:04.158
ungrateful repost delivered
this nigga chicken nuggets

36:04.191 --> 36:08.230
and mozzarella dips
and all kind of shit.

36:08.263 --> 36:11.133
Now, if you going
to go Nick Cage,

36:11.166 --> 36:13.835
and may I add so fuckin' boldly,

36:15.103 --> 36:17.940
go Raisin' Arizona,
go Lord of War.

36:19.207 --> 36:20.641
Shit even go Joe,

36:22.078 --> 36:24.781
you go Leavin' Las Vegas.

36:24.814 --> 36:26.581
Well fuckin' done.

36:26.615 --> 36:28.184
But by the law of Hades,

36:28.217 --> 36:30.186
how the fuck you
gonna go Face Off?

36:30.219 --> 36:31.921
- No, no, no, no.
- Well fuck you sir.

36:31.955 --> 36:33.689
Face Off is a classic film.

36:33.722 --> 36:35.258
You know what,
fuck both of you.

36:35.291 --> 36:36.458
It's not even a film.

36:36.491 --> 36:38.594
Okay, so then what the fuck is it?
A telenovela?

36:40.798 --> 36:45.803
There's a distinct difference
between a movie and a film.

36:46.469 --> 36:47.704
What?

36:47.737 --> 36:49.173
See even the fuckin'
new guy's chimin' in.

36:49.206 --> 36:50.441
Yeah, you ask him.

36:50.473 --> 36:52.508
What the fuck are
you talking about?

36:52.542 --> 36:54.745
Name me the best
films ever, go.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.781
- Shawshank.
- Godfather.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.483
- Scarface.
- Scarface?

37:02.087 --> 37:03.355
New guy's fuckin'
killin' me over here,

37:03.388 --> 37:05.223
I'm agreeing though, Scarface.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.325
I mean, seriously, seriously.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.160
Get the fuck out.

37:09.194 --> 37:10.729
There's the door, go on.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.398
We'll forget that
one, all right?

37:12.431 --> 37:13.366
Yeah, all right.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.234
I mean, Fred here,

37:15.267 --> 37:17.803
seems like things a
little less than perfect.

37:17.837 --> 37:18.636
You know?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.006
I mean his girl.

37:21.774 --> 37:23.009
What you gonna
do about it, Fred?

37:23.042 --> 37:25.979
All right, move the
fuck on, now, quickly.

37:26.013 --> 37:28.514
Finish your fuckin'
film movie nonsense.

37:28.547 --> 37:29.682
Yes, professor.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.218
Why don't you talk?

37:31.251 --> 37:34.154
Hey, he given you one of his
rousing fuckin' speeches yet?

37:34.187 --> 37:36.423
No, you're gonna
fuckin' love this.

37:36.456 --> 37:39.459
Marcus Anthony and Caesar's
funeral every fuckin' time.

37:39.493 --> 37:40.827
Go ahead.

37:42.562 --> 37:45.066
Friends, niggas, countrymen.

37:46.234 --> 37:49.370
Lend me your motherfucking ears.

37:49.404 --> 37:53.808
The best films ever,
Shawshank, Godfather, Scarface.

37:56.277 --> 37:57.278
Thank you!

37:58.414 --> 38:00.382
They all have
something in common.

38:00.416 --> 38:01.250
Anyone?

38:08.257 --> 38:09.091
Realism.

38:10.492 --> 38:14.264
They're all settled in
a measure of realism.

38:15.731 --> 38:18.802
Now, of course, there are some
peculiarities to these rules,

38:18.835 --> 38:21.737
Pulp Fiction borderline
being a movie.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.773
It's very referential.

38:23.807 --> 38:28.411
And the thing, that, seriously,
almost fucking tips it,

38:29.847 --> 38:32.016
Mia Wallace 'don't be a
square' scene, oh my god.

38:32.049 --> 38:33.484
I love that scene.

38:33.517 --> 38:36.053
Near fourth wall-breaking
and spends too much time

38:36.087 --> 38:38.688
tryna' be French New Wave.

38:38.721 --> 38:42.393
Now Star Wars, Harry
fucking Potter, movies.

38:46.031 --> 38:49.534
Back to the Future,
other such relatedness.

38:49.568 --> 38:52.871
Now personally, I prefer film.

38:52.904 --> 38:56.640
If I had to walk around in
a movie world all my life,

38:56.674 --> 38:59.077
well, I'd rather die.

38:59.111 --> 39:03.015
Now my heart is in the
coffin there with truth.

39:05.184 --> 39:08.454
And I must wait until
it returns to me.

39:12.191 --> 39:15.128
So basically,
sci-fi ain't film?

39:17.029 --> 39:20.100
Is that what this nigga
got from what I just said?

39:20.134 --> 39:23.303
Oh my days, for the
welfare of lucidity,

39:23.337 --> 39:25.105
sci-fi can be film.

39:25.139 --> 39:27.808
Perfect example, Twelve Monkeys.

39:28.674 --> 39:29.843
I'm fuckin' confused.

39:29.877 --> 39:31.078
Oh my God.

39:31.111 --> 39:33.547
- No I'm gettin' it.
- It doesn't make no fuckin' sense.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.283
Jaws, Jaws?

39:35.316 --> 39:36.750
Film.

39:36.784 --> 39:38.820
- Jurassic park?
- Film.

39:38.853 --> 39:41.322
- Sunset Boulevard.
- All right, film.

39:41.356 --> 39:42.524
Minority Report.

39:42.557 --> 39:44.092
All right, all right,
do you wanna get off

39:44.125 --> 39:46.561
Spielberg's dick
for a minute, Jesus.

39:46.594 --> 39:47.595
Listen Nath.

39:48.496 --> 39:50.665
This plan, robbin' a bank,

39:53.735 --> 39:56.105
you know that's mad, right?

39:56.138 --> 39:58.641
- Nah, it's fuckin'.
- You too?

39:59.842 --> 40:02.278
Come on man, it's a
fuckin' bank, all right?

40:02.311 --> 40:03.479
Think about it.

40:03.512 --> 40:05.047
In four weeks, with
no fuckin' plan,

40:05.080 --> 40:06.983
how the fuck are we
even gonna do it?

40:07.017 --> 40:08.185
There's no money
in banks anymore.

40:08.218 --> 40:09.619
It's all digital.

40:10.554 --> 40:12.122
Not with this bank.

40:12.155 --> 40:14.157
Three to four hundred K.

40:15.825 --> 40:17.794
Yeah, because
it's a police bank.

40:18.727 --> 40:19.829
Pension's, all that.

40:19.863 --> 40:21.264
- I know, I did my research.
- Police bank,

40:21.298 --> 40:22.366
what the fuck is
he talkin' about?

40:22.400 --> 40:23.301
This is suicide.

40:23.334 --> 40:24.569
The rookie as well, like mate.

40:24.602 --> 40:26.703
Hey, I need new
blood, all right.

40:26.736 --> 40:29.574
Pencil is doin' a
stint, Chris is,

40:30.942 --> 40:33.377
I mean, we can't trust Chris.

40:35.079 --> 40:36.746
After that last job.

40:37.950 --> 40:40.185
Something went wrong,
he seemed culpable,

40:40.219 --> 40:42.321
he might be on that bake.

40:43.754 --> 40:45.424
You know, my money's on
Saida for that last job

40:45.457 --> 40:46.792
and it's downfalls anyway.

40:46.825 --> 40:50.429
Listen, here's the
translucent condition,

40:51.897 --> 40:55.134
I'm doin' this job, even
if me and tenderfoot here

40:55.168 --> 40:56.669
have to go in alone.

40:56.703 --> 40:58.605
If you guys want me
to step out, I can.

40:58.638 --> 40:59.939
Shut the fuck up.

40:59.973 --> 41:01.474
The fuck you talkin' about.

41:01.507 --> 41:03.176
Don't speak another fuckin'
word, you hard-rock right now.

41:03.209 --> 41:04.611
It's fuckin'
suicide all right,

41:04.644 --> 41:06.112
it's fuckin' suicide.

41:06.145 --> 41:08.581
Just think about it man,
use your fuckin' head, huh?

41:08.615 --> 41:10.517
You wanna fuckin' die?

41:10.551 --> 41:12.752
Fuck the piglets.

41:12.786 --> 41:15.155
Here we shall take our stand.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.259
We rob their asses.

41:18.292 --> 41:21.028
I want out, being
a whippin' boy.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.298
You know the rules.

41:25.633 --> 41:29.571
What we do is strictly
business, it's never personal.

41:30.739 --> 41:33.308
But this, I can't
commit to this.

41:35.343 --> 41:38.013
Look I'm sorry, mate, all right?

41:56.499 --> 41:57.333
I'm in.

42:03.573 --> 42:06.777
Just like that,
the Beatles break up.

42:08.712 --> 42:11.348
Nah, this ain't the end, mate.

42:19.290 --> 42:22.260
It's all right, don't worry,

42:22.293 --> 42:26.531
alone I left the womb, so
same I'll enter the tomb.

42:52.292 --> 42:53.560
Hey, it's me.

42:55.061 --> 42:57.163
What do you mean, who me?

42:58.398 --> 43:02.103
Oh, right, yeah,
I'm sure you were.

43:02.136 --> 43:02.970
Oh really?

43:03.871 --> 43:05.539
Yeah, I bet you are.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.110
Jane Perkins, right?

43:42.478 --> 43:44.815
Listen, there's
a gun in my drawer.

43:44.848 --> 43:47.984
It's a 357 magnum, five bullets.

43:48.017 --> 43:49.686
You need to take
it and shoot him,

43:49.720 --> 43:50.889
don't even think twice about it.

43:50.921 --> 43:52.891
I can't shoot him.

43:52.923 --> 43:54.091
Why not?

43:54.124 --> 43:55.559
Have you ever
shot anyone before?

43:55.592 --> 43:58.028
Besides, you're a
mortgage broker so,

43:58.061 --> 43:59.898
why do you even have a
gun in the first place?

43:59.930 --> 44:01.565
This is a highly secured bank.

44:01.598 --> 44:03.300
Even the mortgage brokers?

44:03.333 --> 44:05.603
He wants to kill you.

44:05.637 --> 44:06.806
Why would he wanna kill me?

44:06.839 --> 44:10.208
Because he's fuckin'
black, that's why.

44:11.576 --> 44:13.344
He'll die and take
you down with him,

44:13.378 --> 44:15.613
he's crazy, he'll kill you.

44:17.015 --> 44:18.283
And you?

44:18.316 --> 44:19.651
No, cause you're
not gonna tell him

44:19.684 --> 44:22.021
that I'm in the bathroom.

44:22.054 --> 44:26.325
He's coming, just get the
gun and fuckin' kill him.

44:30.563 --> 44:32.465
Mhm, yeah, mhm.

44:32.498 --> 44:33.834
What the fuck?

44:33.867 --> 44:35.234
Who was that you was talkin' to?

44:35.267 --> 44:37.203
- Who is it?
- I wasn't talkin' to anyone.

44:43.143 --> 44:44.578
Hey Mr.
You, you do not wanna

44:44.611 --> 44:45.913
do whatever you're about to do.

44:45.947 --> 44:48.014
Okay, listen, listen to me,

44:48.048 --> 44:49.249
please tell me what's going on,

44:49.282 --> 44:50.885
Madison, honey, you're
gonna be all right.

44:50.918 --> 44:53.253
Mr. You, listen, talk to me.

44:54.188 --> 44:56.090
Talk to me, come on.

44:56.123 --> 44:57.625
You are in control
of this situation,

44:57.658 --> 44:59.627
nothing has to happen
that you don't want

44:59.660 --> 45:01.329
to happen right now.

45:02.463 --> 45:04.699
Come on, talk to me.

45:04.732 --> 45:08.169
Talk to me, let me
hear somebody's voice.

45:12.040 --> 45:13.442
You wanted proof
of life, you got it.

45:13.475 --> 45:15.110
Oh, thank god, I didn't,

45:15.143 --> 45:16.345
I didn't need this
fuckin' drama,

45:16.378 --> 45:17.646
I drank too much
coffee, I'm gonna have

45:17.679 --> 45:18.614
a fuckin' heart
attack, Madison, honey,

45:18.647 --> 45:20.950
are you hurt, are you okay?

45:20.984 --> 45:22.317
I'm okay.

45:22.351 --> 45:24.520
I'm not hurt, I'm fine.

45:24.553 --> 45:26.155
Good, listen,

45:26.189 --> 45:29.526
I'm doing everything I can
to get you out of here.

45:29.559 --> 45:32.930
Spoiler alert,
you're fuckin' failing.

45:32.963 --> 45:34.464
Madison honey,
I just found out

45:34.497 --> 45:37.500
that my daughter is actually
a fan of yours, all right.

45:37.534 --> 45:39.335
Now do you have a family
member that you want us

45:39.369 --> 45:41.037
to be in touch with like a.

45:41.070 --> 45:42.273
No.

45:42.306 --> 45:43.975
Okay, well
I need to promise.

45:44.009 --> 45:44.876
- Okay.
- No.

45:44.910 --> 45:45.877
- That's enough.
- Mr. You.

45:45.911 --> 45:47.913
Get me my fuckin' car.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.354
Madison Jones.

45:57.388 --> 45:58.523
Say that again.

45:58.557 --> 46:00.158
Madison Jones.

46:00.191 --> 46:01.593
Madison Jones.

46:01.626 --> 46:02.761
That's right.

46:02.794 --> 46:05.263
Sounds
like a famous name.

46:05.297 --> 46:07.967
Ready when
you are, Madison Jones.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.869
Are we doing scene two?

46:09.902 --> 46:12.637
What's it say on
the side, Madison Jones?

46:12.671 --> 46:13.874
Scene two.

46:13.907 --> 46:15.241
So what
are we doing here?

46:15.274 --> 46:18.477
Top of scene two, let's
go, Madison Jones.

46:24.985 --> 46:27.153
When they asked
me if I saw him,

46:27.186 --> 46:29.690
I told them no, not in awhile.

46:31.258 --> 46:34.963
I said that with such an
assuredness, like it meant nothing.

46:34.996 --> 46:37.832
The night before, he
stumbled back into our house,

46:37.865 --> 46:40.068
same as always,
cocky, complacent,

46:40.100 --> 46:41.501
as if he belonged there.

46:41.535 --> 46:45.506
Still, his breath wreaking
as the same spirit

46:45.540 --> 46:47.076
he was so fond of.

46:47.108 --> 46:48.743
He kept on telling me
how much he loved me

46:48.776 --> 46:50.946
and how he didn't mean
it the last night,

46:50.980 --> 46:53.147
he never means it,
but he does it again,

46:53.181 --> 46:55.617
and again, and again.

46:55.650 --> 46:58.152
When he does, I feel ashamed.

46:58.186 --> 47:00.355
Not because I am a victim

47:00.388 --> 47:05.394
but because I feel intrinsically
obliged to forgive him.

47:06.595 --> 47:08.764
I am ashamed because
I am numb to anger.

47:12.601 --> 47:14.104
I can do it again.

47:15.471 --> 47:16.873
No thanks, Madison.

47:16.906 --> 47:18.174
Thank you.

47:18.208 --> 47:19.676
I can do it again,
I was a little.

47:19.709 --> 47:24.514
We'll be in touch
with your agent, Madison.

47:24.547 --> 47:26.616
I'm available for the
whole thing, by the way,

47:26.650 --> 47:27.717
totally free.

47:28.718 --> 47:30.453
Thanks, Madison.

47:38.930 --> 47:41.066
- What do you mean it was okay?
- It was okay.

47:41.099 --> 47:42.134
Did they say that?

47:42.166 --> 47:43.567
I mean, did they
say you were okay?

47:43.601 --> 47:44.635
Did you they say you
were magnificent,

47:44.669 --> 47:45.469
did they say?

47:45.503 --> 47:46.370
I don't know.

47:46.404 --> 47:47.738
Well, you were there.

47:47.772 --> 47:49.306
No, it was okay.

47:49.341 --> 47:51.209
Oh fuck, suppose you're
gonna want some food now,

47:51.243 --> 47:52.444
all right?

47:52.477 --> 47:54.914
Yes, that's why we're here.

47:58.918 --> 48:02.220
You say it's okay,
that's okay, this is okay.

48:02.254 --> 48:03.422
How was your food?

48:03.455 --> 48:05.525
Okay, I mean, that's
all I ever get from you.

48:05.558 --> 48:07.895
It's okay, okay, okay, okay.

48:10.663 --> 48:12.498
Maybe I'm just okay.

48:13.967 --> 48:16.003
I get you an audition.

48:16.036 --> 48:18.404
Big film, biggest
audition of your life,

48:18.438 --> 48:21.442
why can't you be great
or magnificent even,

48:21.475 --> 48:23.812
where is this waitress?

48:23.845 --> 48:25.579
Okayish, okay.

48:25.612 --> 48:27.214
Yeah, who said that?

48:27.247 --> 48:28.315
The dalai lama.

48:28.348 --> 48:29.717
I don't even know who that is?

48:29.750 --> 48:30.584
No?

48:31.685 --> 48:33.220
Well I've seen all
those buddhism websites

48:33.253 --> 48:34.488
on your laptop.

48:38.894 --> 48:40.930
You've been looking
at my history?

48:40.963 --> 48:44.265
- So?
- Do I not get any privacy?

48:44.299 --> 48:46.534
All I want is for you to say,

48:46.568 --> 48:50.305
mum, I love you, thank
you for the auditions,

48:51.573 --> 48:53.944
the loving, the
food, the hot coffee.

48:53.977 --> 48:56.213
Where is this fucking waitress?

48:56.245 --> 48:57.914
Might be a waiter.

49:01.317 --> 49:02.518
They charge you
service charge,

49:02.551 --> 49:05.454
what service are
they referring to?

49:10.027 --> 49:12.262
I'm not sure I wanna act.

49:14.364 --> 49:15.199
What?

49:18.136 --> 49:19.871
Madison Jean Brown,
repeat yourself,

49:19.904 --> 49:21.906
I didn't quite hear you.

49:23.573 --> 49:27.913
Jean, I don't know what
your middle name is, Brown,

49:27.946 --> 49:29.047
I like singing.

49:29.081 --> 49:30.515
You didn't say that.

49:30.548 --> 49:31.582
Say what you said before.

49:31.616 --> 49:33.018
I said I'm not
sure I wanna act.

49:33.051 --> 49:34.253
Not sure?

49:34.285 --> 49:35.954
What does not sure even mean?

49:35.988 --> 49:38.891
Okay, I do not
want to act, Jean.

49:42.896 --> 49:46.665
Listen, I don't wanna
be that football mum,

49:46.698 --> 49:49.434
you know, mumager,
I'm not trying

49:50.803 --> 49:53.772
to live my life
through you, seriously.

49:53.806 --> 49:55.275
I've done the acting thing,

49:55.307 --> 49:56.341
I was successful.

49:56.375 --> 49:57.211
Oh, was?

49:58.411 --> 50:01.314
I do not, at all,
need to live my life

50:01.347 --> 50:03.851
through you, I really don't.

50:03.884 --> 50:05.853
But you got a talent.

50:05.886 --> 50:07.487
- Yeah, singing.
- Acting.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.788
Well dad thought
it was singing.

50:08.823 --> 50:12.026
Oh I'm sorry, where
is that yank now?

50:12.059 --> 50:14.296
Oh, is that the guy who ran
off with all your money?

50:14.328 --> 50:16.164
We don't know that, okay?

50:16.198 --> 50:20.135
Wake up Madison, you're
16, nearly 17, just wake up.

50:20.168 --> 50:21.136
Some service here.

50:21.169 --> 50:22.137
Wow, noise pollution.

50:22.170 --> 50:24.039
Noise pollution.

50:24.072 --> 50:27.309
You, my dear, are a walking
carbon fuckin' footprint,

50:27.341 --> 50:31.513
every time you open your
mouth, a polar bear dies.

50:33.983 --> 50:35.383
Okay, ridiculous.

50:42.091 --> 50:44.593
Are we staying in
a hotel tonight, or?

50:44.626 --> 50:48.999
No, tonight we are
staying in a lush mansion.

50:49.032 --> 50:51.367
Managed to suck some
rich guy's cock.

50:51.400 --> 50:53.170
He's putting us
up for the night.

50:53.203 --> 50:55.771
At least someone shut
your mouth for a bit.

50:55.805 --> 50:57.941
Some fucking service here.

51:14.225 --> 51:17.863
You know I want what's
best for you, right?

51:20.900 --> 51:24.003
I know I wasn't around
when you was younger,

51:24.036 --> 51:26.537
I was too busy with my career.

51:28.706 --> 51:31.442
I knew that's why you still
call me Jean, I get it,

51:31.476 --> 51:32.311
but I.

51:40.253 --> 51:42.155
This is never about me.

51:43.689 --> 51:45.524
It's always about you.

51:47.193 --> 51:49.429
I want you to have
a chance at this,

51:49.462 --> 51:52.366
and I'm not talking
about acting,

51:52.400 --> 51:54.302
I'm talking about life.

51:58.406 --> 52:02.076
I want you to have the
best, you're my girl.

52:08.383 --> 52:12.921
If anything were to happen
to you, I don't what I'd do.

52:16.258 --> 52:17.826
Don't ever leave me.

52:22.131 --> 52:23.066
I love you.

52:25.767 --> 52:27.170
I love you too.

52:52.429 --> 52:54.099
Get off the floor.

52:56.301 --> 52:58.236
Hey, get off the floor.

53:00.905 --> 53:02.606
It's dirty.

53:02.639 --> 53:05.410
Don't tell me what to do.

53:05.443 --> 53:08.213
People always tell
me what to do.

53:08.246 --> 53:09.448
Not anymore.

53:09.482 --> 53:10.615
That's life.

53:11.649 --> 53:12.918
Get used to it.

53:12.952 --> 53:15.620
All day long, my
mom, do this, do that.

53:15.653 --> 53:17.390
My dad, god, fuck him.

53:25.765 --> 53:29.702
My dad, he used to
preach to me all the time.

53:32.039 --> 53:34.474
He should've been a preacher.

53:37.277 --> 53:40.080
Is that who you were
talking to on the phone?

53:40.113 --> 53:41.916
- Your mom?
- No.

53:41.949 --> 53:43.451
Right, who then?

53:46.054 --> 53:47.654
- Does it matter?
- It matters to me.

53:47.687 --> 53:49.891
- So.
- So that Stockholm Syndrome

53:49.924 --> 53:51.758
you spoke of.

53:51.792 --> 53:52.960
How 'bout now?

53:57.565 --> 54:00.402
No one ever listens
to a thing I say.

54:00.436 --> 54:03.738
My whole life, they
think I'm some simpleton,

54:03.771 --> 54:05.207
got no voice, that's
what they think.

54:05.240 --> 54:06.408
Maybe they're right.

54:06.442 --> 54:07.843
Now look at this mess,
everything's fucked,

54:07.876 --> 54:08.911
fuckin' chaos theory.

54:08.944 --> 54:11.679
- Not chaos theory.
- No?

54:11.712 --> 54:14.451
Chaos theory is the
exact opposite of chaos,

54:14.484 --> 54:16.519
it's the, doesn't matter.

54:26.296 --> 54:30.700
Something is everything and
nothing at the same time.

54:34.872 --> 54:37.875
Something, not everything,
exactly everything

54:37.908 --> 54:39.510
is everything and
nothing at the same time

54:39.543 --> 54:43.547
so your gun, the floor,
this situation, you, me.

54:47.452 --> 54:49.254
- Sit down.
- This wall.

54:49.287 --> 54:51.289
- Sit down.
- The table.

54:51.323 --> 54:52.324
Sit down!

54:52.357 --> 54:53.691
Do you get it?

54:56.161 --> 54:57.996
- No.
- You can exactly put

54:58.029 --> 54:59.830
all importance, no
importance into something,

54:59.865 --> 55:02.869
it's weight, it's value, it's
what you choose it to be.

55:02.902 --> 55:03.936
- All right.
- You get it.

55:03.970 --> 55:05.271
- Sure.
- Ah, you don't get it.

55:05.304 --> 55:06.805
I do.

55:06.839 --> 55:08.807
It's some spiritual
vegan bullshit.

55:08.841 --> 55:10.476
- God, what is your problem?
- What?

55:10.510 --> 55:11.810
I don't what you believe in,

55:11.844 --> 55:13.179
you have a gun, you
have an attitude,

55:13.212 --> 55:14.180
- but why either?
- Because.

55:14.213 --> 55:15.381
Because?

55:15.414 --> 55:17.317
- Yeah, because.
- So you want chaos?

55:17.351 --> 55:18.986
Yeah, I want chaos theory.

55:19.019 --> 55:21.754
Ugh, annoying, god, did
you even go to school?

55:21.787 --> 55:23.490
I did go to school.

55:23.524 --> 55:25.791
Maybe not one as fancy
as yours, but I did.

55:25.825 --> 55:27.060
I'm not stupid.

55:34.835 --> 55:36.838
What about your dad, hm?

55:37.906 --> 55:39.340
What about him?

55:39.374 --> 55:43.444
Is he something and
nothing at the same time?

55:43.478 --> 55:46.481
Why'd you bring
my dad up for, hm?

55:46.514 --> 55:48.283
Trying to wind me up?

55:49.518 --> 55:50.785
Just curious.

55:53.489 --> 55:54.323
So?

55:59.929 --> 56:02.830
My name is Madison
Jones, I'm 16,

56:03.966 --> 56:06.903
17 next week, these
are my profiles

56:10.907 --> 56:12.808
and these are my hands.

56:14.477 --> 56:15.879
I don't get it.

56:22.386 --> 56:25.456
When they asked
me if I saw him,

56:25.489 --> 56:27.992
I told them no, not in awhile.

56:30.928 --> 56:34.098
I said that with such
assuredness like,

56:34.131 --> 56:35.967
like it meant nothing.

56:38.170 --> 56:42.341
The night before, he
stumbled back into our house,

56:43.609 --> 56:46.445
same as always,
cocky, complacent,

56:51.083 --> 56:52.584
as if he belonged.

56:53.920 --> 56:57.590
Still, his breath wreaking
of the same spirit

57:00.360 --> 57:03.563
he was so fond of,
he kept on telling me

57:03.596 --> 57:05.331
how much he loved me.

57:07.133 --> 57:10.604
And how he didn't
mean it that night.

57:10.638 --> 57:12.139
He never means it.

57:13.806 --> 57:17.311
But he does it again,
and again, and again.

57:23.150 --> 57:25.587
When he does, I feel ashamed.

57:26.621 --> 57:28.690
Not because I'm a victim,

57:30.492 --> 57:33.827
but because I feel
intrinsically obliged

57:35.664 --> 57:37.999
to forgive him, I am ashamed

57:41.470 --> 57:43.739
because I am numb to anger.

58:07.698 --> 58:08.765
How was that?

58:13.837 --> 58:15.606
It's from a script from a
film I auditioned for about

58:15.640 --> 58:17.942
a month ago, I
probably didn't get it.

58:17.975 --> 58:20.912
I thought you said
you were a singer.

58:20.945 --> 58:21.779
That was,

58:25.049 --> 58:27.318
good, that was really good.

58:30.222 --> 58:31.590
You got a talent.

58:31.623 --> 58:35.994
I wasn't as good as
that in the audition.

58:36.028 --> 58:37.863
I didn't wanna get it.

58:38.831 --> 58:41.867
I didn't want my
mum to be right.

58:41.900 --> 58:43.802
Didn't want her to win.

58:44.971 --> 58:46.473
You won though.

58:46.506 --> 58:47.674
How?

58:47.707 --> 58:49.609
Got me off the floor.

58:51.044 --> 58:51.878
Happy?

58:54.714 --> 58:56.416
- Where's this car?
- What car?

58:56.449 --> 58:58.184
I made a demand while
you were in the bathroom

58:58.218 --> 58:59.786
- on your phone.
- At least I wasn't taking

58:59.819 --> 59:02.490
a shit when you burst in, right?

59:03.924 --> 59:05.159
You trust them?

59:06.360 --> 59:07.628
Most likely I
walk out of here,

59:07.661 --> 59:09.663
they shoot or arrest me.

59:11.799 --> 59:13.467
So let me go then.

59:14.635 --> 59:17.272
No, I get it, you
can't let me go.

59:22.177 --> 59:23.178
You need me.

59:24.780 --> 59:26.348
So what's the plan?

59:27.649 --> 59:28.917
I don't know.

59:30.786 --> 59:33.189
I wish they didn't shoot him.

59:34.657 --> 59:36.092
He'd have a plan.

59:37.226 --> 59:40.730
A way out, I was
just working on it.

59:40.763 --> 59:42.131
Working on it, no,
you're sitting here

59:42.165 --> 59:44.333
crying feeling
sorry for yourself,

59:44.367 --> 59:47.270
I mean, come on man, you've
gotta pull yourself together.

59:47.303 --> 59:49.173
Have you even looked
at that fire exit door

59:49.206 --> 59:50.741
since we got back in here?

59:50.774 --> 59:54.411
Hm, what if, what if they
come storming in, hm?

59:54.445 --> 59:57.080
Smash everything
down, take you away,

59:57.114 --> 59:58.682
you're just hiding.

1:00:02.519 --> 1:00:06.558
So listen, there's still some
money left over in the bank,

1:00:06.591 --> 1:00:07.893
you can grab some.

1:00:07.927 --> 1:00:09.160
When the vintage car comes,

1:00:09.194 --> 1:00:10.628
walk me out the
front door with you,

1:00:10.662 --> 1:00:12.564
use me as a shield, they
are not gonna risk shooting

1:00:12.597 --> 1:00:15.266
some teenage white girl who's
got so much to live for.

1:00:15.300 --> 1:00:17.702
Okay, then, when
the car comes, yeah,

1:00:17.735 --> 1:00:18.938
you're gonna put me in the car,

1:00:18.970 --> 1:00:20.205
dump the car anywhere,
dump me anywhere,

1:00:20.238 --> 1:00:21.974
get a new ID, get on
a plane and bounce.

1:00:22.007 --> 1:00:23.008
- Bounce?
- Bounce.

1:00:23.042 --> 1:00:24.343
- New ID?
- Yeah, you're probably

1:00:24.376 --> 1:00:25.578
gonna have to get
rid of your phone,

1:00:25.611 --> 1:00:26.779
get a burner, I don't know,

1:00:26.812 --> 1:00:28.581
plane hop to Cuba or
Brazil, some place hot.

1:00:28.614 --> 1:00:29.950
- Done this before?
- I watch movies.

1:00:29.982 --> 1:00:30.783
Moves or films?

1:00:30.816 --> 1:00:31.617
What's the difference?

1:00:31.650 --> 1:00:32.451
Jaws, film,

1:00:32.485 --> 1:00:33.954
Minority Report, movie.

1:00:33.986 --> 1:00:34.820
I think.

1:00:35.754 --> 1:00:36.958
I don't get it.

1:00:36.990 --> 1:00:38.458
How much do you
reckon's there?

1:00:38.492 --> 1:00:43.029
Oh I saw a bunch of cash
when you dragged me in here.

1:00:44.197 --> 1:00:47.969
There could be hundreds,
maybe even thousands,

1:00:48.001 --> 1:00:49.836
it's all on the floor.

1:00:53.307 --> 1:00:56.444
I mean, you could live off
thousands for awhile, right?

1:00:56.477 --> 1:00:58.981
- What do you like?
- Like?

1:00:59.013 --> 1:01:02.717
In life, what are your
hobbies, your interests?

1:01:02.750 --> 1:01:03.986
- Well I don't know.
- Come on,

1:01:04.018 --> 1:01:05.052
there must be something.

1:01:05.086 --> 1:01:07.655
I like cars, I
like vintage cars.

1:01:07.688 --> 1:01:08.892
You sure?

1:01:08.925 --> 1:01:10.459
Sorry, it just seems
like something you'd say

1:01:10.492 --> 1:01:12.728
to make it seem to people like
you have an interest in life.

1:01:12.761 --> 1:01:14.530
You know, a boy's thing.

1:01:14.563 --> 1:01:16.665
Yeah, I'm sure,
I was a mechanic.

1:01:16.698 --> 1:01:18.133
Oh my god, well there you go,

1:01:18.166 --> 1:01:19.401
eureka, right, this
is what you do, okay?

1:01:19.434 --> 1:01:21.537
You are gonna move to Bolivia,

1:01:21.570 --> 1:01:24.172
set up a vintage car
store, maybe even a garage

1:01:24.206 --> 1:01:26.276
and then, you're
gonna call it, ready,

1:01:26.309 --> 1:01:30.046
wait for it, Nath's
Place, you know,

1:01:30.079 --> 1:01:31.481
in honour of your friend.

1:01:31.514 --> 1:01:33.550
- Maybe.
- I mean what were you gonna do with the money anyway?

1:01:33.583 --> 1:01:36.085
Buy a car, get out the hood.

1:01:37.253 --> 1:01:38.555
Just drive.

1:01:38.588 --> 1:01:40.824
It's a good idea, I mean,
no one wants to live in the hood.

1:01:40.858 --> 1:01:42.293
Well why am I the lucky
one that gets to leave?

1:01:42.326 --> 1:01:43.193
Who cares?

1:01:43.227 --> 1:01:45.062
It's your life, free will.

1:01:45.095 --> 1:01:46.430
Yeah, I guess.

1:01:49.633 --> 1:01:51.970
How's your upper class mansion?

1:01:52.003 --> 1:01:53.203
Mansion?

1:01:53.237 --> 1:01:54.705
No, no, I don't
live in a mansion.

1:01:54.738 --> 1:01:55.639
Bullshit.

1:01:57.275 --> 1:02:00.046
Fuckin' suburban
girl if ever saw one.

1:02:00.078 --> 1:02:03.381
With your suburban problems,
I can see it in your eyes.

1:02:03.415 --> 1:02:07.319
Daddy ran off with my
rich girl money bullshit.

1:02:16.862 --> 1:02:19.131
Think what you wanna think.

1:02:19.165 --> 1:02:21.267
We all have our problems.

1:02:31.244 --> 1:02:33.246
There is money.

1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:34.214
Told you.

1:02:35.984 --> 1:02:37.484
I'm gonna do it.

1:02:43.390 --> 1:02:46.095
Mr. You,
how you doin' baby?

1:02:46.127 --> 1:02:47.462
I would love to talk to Madison.

1:02:47.495 --> 1:02:48.496
Where's my car?

1:02:48.529 --> 1:02:49.932
All right,
the car is gonna take.

1:02:49.965 --> 1:02:51.766
- You've got one hour.
- I need.

1:02:51.799 --> 1:02:54.636
- 90 minutes or she dies.
- I need at least two,

1:02:54.669 --> 1:02:59.008
don't be, what do you
mean, she dies, you mother?

1:02:59.041 --> 1:03:01.176
When the car comes, we go
straight out the front door,

1:03:01.210 --> 1:03:03.545
take as much cash as we can.

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:26.037
How you been?

1:03:26.070 --> 1:03:27.804
You mean since the last time?

1:03:27.837 --> 1:03:30.407
Yeah, exactly right.

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:33.310
Pretty good, miss
this room though.

1:03:33.344 --> 1:03:35.080
Yeah?

1:03:35.113 --> 1:03:38.482
It's got a charm, a certain
palatial aesthetic to it.

1:03:38.516 --> 1:03:40.052
Palatial?

1:03:40.085 --> 1:03:43.088
Plenty of time to
read in here, huh?

1:03:44.488 --> 1:03:46.925
In here you either push
weights or push pages.

1:03:46.958 --> 1:03:48.727
Or push dope.

1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:50.163
No sir, not me.

1:03:51.663 --> 1:03:54.399
Drugs are the devil's food.

1:03:54.433 --> 1:03:56.234
I got a list of
misdemeanours here that suggest

1:03:56.268 --> 1:03:58.971
that you may be consuming
the devil's food.

1:03:59.005 --> 1:04:00.739
Is that what you wanna do?

1:04:00.772 --> 1:04:03.775
Spend the rest of
your life in jail?

1:04:05.344 --> 1:04:07.246
Is that for?

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:08.681
Sure, go ahead.

1:04:26.867 --> 1:04:29.003
Thank you, sir.

1:04:29.037 --> 1:04:31.206
Cut the sir, shit.

1:04:33.307 --> 1:04:34.641
Where were we?

1:04:36.010 --> 1:04:37.512
I asked you
if you wanna spend

1:04:37.545 --> 1:04:38.480
the rest of your life.

1:04:38.513 --> 1:04:40.950
The rest of my life in jail?

1:04:40.983 --> 1:04:43.219
Yeah, I remember now.

1:04:43.251 --> 1:04:44.586
I'd favour not to.

1:04:44.619 --> 1:04:46.821
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:04:46.855 --> 1:04:48.057
Then why re offend?

1:04:48.090 --> 1:04:50.658
I mean, some of these
are repeat offences.

1:04:50.692 --> 1:04:51.526
Can I?

1:04:52.695 --> 1:04:54.197
Go for it.

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:59.002
Most gangster
move ever, Ceaser,

1:05:00.669 --> 1:05:03.173
knowing his reign
would one day end,

1:05:03.206 --> 1:05:06.642
maybe in betrayal,
writes in his will,

1:05:06.675 --> 1:05:11.448
Augustus, a boy, nearly 17,
would acquire all his wealth,

1:05:12.917 --> 1:05:15.119
upon his own certain demise.

1:05:15.153 --> 1:05:16.586
Octavian.

1:05:17.754 --> 1:05:20.925
I'm sorry, what was
the point of that?

1:05:22.325 --> 1:05:23.860
Nothin'.

1:05:23.895 --> 1:05:27.765
Wouldn't you be
happier doing a normal thing?

1:05:27.799 --> 1:05:29.034
Normal thing?

1:05:31.736 --> 1:05:34.372
Yeah, a J-O-B,
someone to love,

1:05:34.405 --> 1:05:38.143
a nice clean bed, garden,
maybe a dog or two.

1:05:39.710 --> 1:05:41.713
I'm allergic to dogs.

1:05:41.747 --> 1:05:44.884
And is that why you think we
were put here on this earth?

1:05:47.287 --> 1:05:51.723
Three percent of animals are
monogamous, home building,

1:05:51.757 --> 1:05:53.492
cookie cutter.

1:05:53.525 --> 1:05:58.531
Three to five percent,
and we're not animals.

1:05:59.399 --> 1:06:00.901
No we're better than animals.

1:06:00.935 --> 1:06:02.802
You know this morning, when
I purchased my daily coffee,

1:06:02.836 --> 1:06:04.504
I was served by a
pretty coloured girl

1:06:04.537 --> 1:06:06.273
who always serves me.

1:06:06.307 --> 1:06:08.775
I think she's
Nigerian or somethin'.

1:06:08.808 --> 1:06:11.411
She got them scars, irrelevant.

1:06:12.580 --> 1:06:15.416
Point is, I wasn't
served by no penguin

1:06:15.449 --> 1:06:18.586
or a parakeet or even a dolphin.

1:06:18.619 --> 1:06:21.189
Apparently dolphins are
meant to be pretty smart.

1:06:21.223 --> 1:06:25.459
But I never seen a dolphin
trade on the stock exchange.

1:06:25.492 --> 1:06:27.761
Animals are pretty useless.

1:06:29.464 --> 1:06:33.202
Well, that sir, is
a factual statement.

1:06:33.236 --> 1:06:35.304
Cut the sir shit.

1:06:37.974 --> 1:06:40.375
Again, we reached an impasse.

1:06:41.776 --> 1:06:44.480
Do you wanna spend the
rest of your life in jail?

1:06:44.513 --> 1:06:47.683
All this education
you've taught yourself?

1:06:47.717 --> 1:06:52.289
Don't you wanna show the
world how smart you've become?

1:06:55.625 --> 1:06:57.860
Kay, let's play this out.

1:07:00.063 --> 1:07:03.902
I get outta here, I go
apply for say, 15 jobs.

1:07:05.802 --> 1:07:08.639
That's the normal thing, right?

1:07:08.672 --> 1:07:11.276
Now I get interviews, cause
I got a degree in here

1:07:11.309 --> 1:07:15.113
and one out there, so
they'll see me for sure,

1:07:15.146 --> 1:07:19.684
I get there, nice suit, say
I borrow one from a friend.

1:07:19.717 --> 1:07:23.655
I start talkin', you
know, turn on the charm,

1:07:23.688 --> 1:07:26.992
tell 'em a tale about Moken
sea gipsies of the Andaman Sea

1:07:27.026 --> 1:07:30.062
and how they developed the
ability to focus sight underwater

1:07:30.095 --> 1:07:32.265
so they could hunt
for they food.

1:07:32.299 --> 1:07:35.035
Tell 'em a joke or two,
you know, get 'em on my side.

1:07:35.068 --> 1:07:38.405
Now at this stage, they love me.

1:07:38.437 --> 1:07:42.474
Then they ask me
that, menial question,

1:07:42.508 --> 1:07:45.477
you know, the one they ask
you for mere formality.

1:07:45.511 --> 1:07:47.414
Do you have a criminal record?

1:07:47.446 --> 1:07:50.051
Expecting a quick, firm no.

1:07:50.084 --> 1:07:53.421
I mean, I know my
shit, got a nice suit,

1:07:54.788 --> 1:07:59.592
two degrees, dialled back
demeanour, oh he speaks so well,

1:08:00.460 --> 1:08:02.629
how could I have a record?

1:08:02.662 --> 1:08:05.934
But, in fact, I retort
yes, sheepishly.

1:08:07.735 --> 1:08:11.907
Their jaws drop, I don't
get the job, I gotta eat.

1:08:14.608 --> 1:08:17.145
Government wages ain't enough.

1:08:17.179 --> 1:08:18.813
So if I gotta eat
before somebody else

1:08:18.846 --> 1:08:22.085
than that's just the
way it's gotta be.

1:08:23.953 --> 1:08:26.588
There's other
ways, though, isn't there?

1:08:26.621 --> 1:08:29.624
There's ways you can
get out of here early

1:08:29.658 --> 1:08:32.395
and be good for your community.

1:08:32.428 --> 1:08:33.762
My community?

1:08:33.795 --> 1:08:35.697
Your community.

1:08:36.799 --> 1:08:38.634
And which one would
that be, master?

1:08:38.668 --> 1:08:40.337
Please tell me, sir.

1:08:44.308 --> 1:08:48.445
Didn't I tell
you not to call me sir?

1:08:48.479 --> 1:08:50.880
Now are we animals, huh, huh?

1:08:56.154 --> 1:08:57.588
I can't hear you.

1:08:58.522 --> 1:09:00.125
I can't hear you.

1:09:20.312 --> 1:09:23.215
Since we agree, we
are not animals,

1:09:24.683 --> 1:09:27.620
since we now have
an understanding,

1:09:29.189 --> 1:09:34.127
I think we both also agree,
you should help your community.

1:09:38.398 --> 1:09:41.169
Because we all
need to be normal.

1:09:52.646 --> 1:09:57.386
For this job, I'm Quint,
you Brody, no more real names.

1:09:58.719 --> 1:10:00.489
What's that called?

1:10:00.522 --> 1:10:02.291
What you're fixin' to buy?

1:10:02.324 --> 1:10:04.393
'70 to '75 BMW CSL 3.0.

1:10:06.895 --> 1:10:07.963
You seen batman?

1:10:07.996 --> 1:10:10.499
'60s batman, bam, boom, crash!

1:10:12.168 --> 1:10:15.572
It's similar to his,
they actually called it the batmobile.

1:10:15.604 --> 1:10:19.142
Someday's you just
can't get rid of a bomb.

1:10:19.175 --> 1:10:21.077
That's from the show.

1:10:23.313 --> 1:10:25.548
Hey man, you trust Saida?

1:10:28.319 --> 1:10:29.819
Got no reason not to.

1:10:29.853 --> 1:10:32.123
Started to deduce
that she may have been

1:10:32.156 --> 1:10:35.159
the reason that that
last job went Hitchcock.

1:10:35.192 --> 1:10:36.893
Remember that Lisa
I told you about?

1:10:36.927 --> 1:10:38.996
Yeah, she gon' be there later.

1:10:39.029 --> 1:10:40.931
She saw some doubt in my mind.

1:10:40.965 --> 1:10:42.299
Paranoid, man.

1:10:44.001 --> 1:10:46.138
We gettin' the gun off
Saida at nine, right?

1:10:46.171 --> 1:10:47.105
What time?

1:10:47.139 --> 1:10:49.474
Time to get a watch, nigga.

1:10:51.143 --> 1:10:52.210
What's wrong?

1:10:54.146 --> 1:10:56.515
You don't like that word.

1:10:56.548 --> 1:10:58.617
I see you flinchin'
every time I use it.

1:10:58.649 --> 1:11:01.287
Is that why you keep usin' it?

1:11:04.090 --> 1:11:05.291
Ain't my favourite word.

1:11:05.324 --> 1:11:06.125
Why?

1:11:06.159 --> 1:11:07.360
It's oppressive.

1:11:07.393 --> 1:11:08.760
Oppressive?

1:11:08.793 --> 1:11:10.062
What, you not a nigga now?

1:11:10.096 --> 1:11:11.330
Nope.

1:11:11.364 --> 1:11:12.598
Why?

1:11:12.632 --> 1:11:15.434
Oh but, cause you
white and black?

1:11:16.970 --> 1:11:18.539
No, I'm not naive.

1:11:19.705 --> 1:11:21.175
To know that when a
white person sees me,

1:11:21.208 --> 1:11:24.411
any person sees
me, they see black.

1:11:24.444 --> 1:11:25.279
Then?

1:11:26.879 --> 1:11:29.316
It's oppressive,
that's all man.

1:11:29.349 --> 1:11:30.450
Oppressive.

1:11:31.652 --> 1:11:34.088
I do love how you use that word.

1:11:34.122 --> 1:11:35.657
As if it's academic.

1:11:35.689 --> 1:11:38.859
Those academic
books you construe,

1:11:38.892 --> 1:11:42.397
they don't tell us
about African monarchs.

1:11:42.430 --> 1:11:44.265
Or Mansa Musa of Mali,

1:11:45.633 --> 1:11:48.637
the richest man
ever, black African.

1:11:52.575 --> 1:11:56.478
Inclination toward deception
through passive education.

1:11:56.512 --> 1:11:58.713
You got me all wrong.

1:11:58.746 --> 1:12:00.082
I don't read books.

1:12:03.652 --> 1:12:05.488
I just don't like the
word, that's all man.

1:12:05.522 --> 1:12:08.592
Nah man, you gotta have
reason behind things.

1:12:08.625 --> 1:12:11.995
Like, you have a
liability to articulate.

1:12:13.496 --> 1:12:17.434
There should be no utterance
lacking delineation.

1:12:17.467 --> 1:12:20.404
Okay, well, I
just don't feel like

1:12:22.573 --> 1:12:26.477
I, that word, that word
makes me feel enslaved.

1:12:29.247 --> 1:12:31.815
Well shit, enslaved, he says.

1:12:33.351 --> 1:12:35.720
Nigga, you can't
even say the word.

1:12:35.752 --> 1:12:38.190
Course you enslaved,
enslaved by letters

1:12:38.223 --> 1:12:40.025
all lined up in a row.

1:12:40.058 --> 1:12:43.328
N-I-G-G-E-R.

1:12:43.362 --> 1:12:47.765
When you learn to declare
it, then you shall be free.

1:12:50.202 --> 1:12:51.036
Say it.

1:12:53.006 --> 1:12:54.574
Come on, now.

1:12:54.607 --> 1:12:56.276
- No.
- Boy,

1:12:56.309 --> 1:12:59.545
I am a victim of
disappointment in you.

1:12:59.579 --> 1:13:03.349
Yeah, you the most
enslaved free nigga I met.

1:13:04.584 --> 1:13:07.086
And look at that milky skin.

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:09.690
And here you are,
fixin' to rob a bank.

1:13:09.723 --> 1:13:13.260
What a squander, what
a zealous squander.

1:13:13.294 --> 1:13:17.765
Do you know what I would
do with skin like that?

1:13:17.797 --> 1:13:20.668
What's in this job for you?

1:13:20.701 --> 1:13:22.902
Besides the 200K split.

1:13:22.936 --> 1:13:23.771
Yeah.

1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:26.708
You can't just be
doing this because

1:13:26.741 --> 1:13:29.711
you're angry with the police.

1:13:29.744 --> 1:13:31.845
I mean, we are criminals.

1:13:34.382 --> 1:13:37.152
- We made that choice.
- I counter.

1:13:38.019 --> 1:13:40.656
We didn't choose this life.

1:13:40.690 --> 1:13:41.691
It chose us.

1:13:42.824 --> 1:13:45.061
We were born to be
in this exact moment.

1:13:45.094 --> 1:13:49.398
In this exact space, having
this exact same conversation.

1:13:49.432 --> 1:13:52.867
Didn't choose to be
subjected to slavery.

1:13:54.370 --> 1:13:57.674
They won't let us erect statues,

1:13:57.708 --> 1:13:59.976
so we'll tear theirs down.

1:14:00.010 --> 1:14:02.112
They won't salute our heroes,

1:14:02.145 --> 1:14:05.415
so we'll make our
heroes martyrs.

1:14:05.449 --> 1:14:08.418
They won't acknowledge
our brevity,

1:14:08.452 --> 1:14:11.054
so we'll become
disquieted lighthouses.

1:14:11.088 --> 1:14:12.824
Puttin' 'em in darkness.

1:14:12.856 --> 1:14:14.292
Blindin' 'em with
a light so dense

1:14:14.325 --> 1:14:17.128
that they'll be forced to look.

1:14:17.161 --> 1:14:21.299
Then, and only then, will
I feel a sense of parity.

1:14:25.269 --> 1:14:26.104
Now,

1:14:31.043 --> 1:14:33.946
this score tomorrow
don't go right,

they gon' tell you a
lot of shit about me,

1:14:37.316 --> 1:14:40.152
some of it may be
true, most lies,

1:14:41.186 --> 1:14:43.288
but understand one thing,

1:14:45.091 --> 1:14:46.526
this is personal.

1:14:51.030 --> 1:14:54.033
I don't give a fuck
about the money.

1:14:55.335 --> 1:14:57.170
I'm gon' plant a flag.

1:15:03.978 --> 1:15:04.812
Right.

1:15:07.214 --> 1:15:08.916
What time is it?

1:15:08.949 --> 1:15:11.585
Time to get a watch, nigga.

1:15:11.619 --> 1:15:12.453
Damn.

1:15:14.822 --> 1:15:18.427
Hey, you wanna leave
without payin' again?

1:15:21.963 --> 1:15:24.900
Is there any
other way to leave?

1:15:48.592 --> 1:15:50.761
Call me Lisa, with an S.

1:15:50.794 --> 1:15:54.264
Not Liza, not Eliza, or
even fuckin' Elizabeth.

1:15:54.298 --> 1:15:55.098
Lisa with an S.

1:15:55.132 --> 1:15:56.834
Lisa with an S.

1:15:56.867 --> 1:16:00.170
I'm the morning after pill
of his little operations.

1:16:00.204 --> 1:16:02.739
When shit goes wrong, I
fix shit that goes wrong.

1:16:02.773 --> 1:16:06.578
And I know you motherfuckers
gon' end up callin' me.

1:16:06.611 --> 1:16:08.213
Bank job, bullshit.

1:16:09.647 --> 1:16:13.218
Lisa with an S, wanna
keep schtum for a minute?

1:16:13.251 --> 1:16:14.419
Like it?

1:16:14.452 --> 1:16:16.721
What's up with
the fuckin' stripes?

1:16:16.754 --> 1:16:20.025
Long story I don't
favour to share now.

1:16:29.368 --> 1:16:30.603
- Want her?
- No.

1:16:34.006 --> 1:16:35.007
What's wrong with her?

1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:38.078
She's high, she's having fun.

1:16:38.111 --> 1:16:41.581
- So what's the situation?
- With?

1:16:41.615 --> 1:16:43.183
- With?
- Yeah with?

1:16:44.284 --> 1:16:46.186
With tomorrow, Saida.

1:16:46.219 --> 1:16:48.355
Job is fine as silk.

1:16:48.388 --> 1:16:49.723
Oh yeah?

1:16:49.756 --> 1:16:51.391
Like the last job?

1:16:51.424 --> 1:16:52.260
Silky too?

1:16:53.227 --> 1:16:55.396
Cause that shit when haywire.

1:16:55.429 --> 1:16:58.432
Somethin' a little
suspect about it.

1:16:59.367 --> 1:17:02.036
I was thinkin' the same thing.

1:17:03.771 --> 1:17:06.674
He taught you all of his tricks?

1:17:06.707 --> 1:17:07.608
Most.

1:17:07.642 --> 1:17:09.711
Taught him any of yours?

1:17:11.713 --> 1:17:13.315
So, we good with the gun?

1:17:13.348 --> 1:17:15.617
Now hold on there, Brody.

1:17:15.651 --> 1:17:18.587
Me and my old friend
Saida here are prattlin'.

1:17:18.620 --> 1:17:21.958
Not often we can just
sit, chew the cud.

1:17:24.995 --> 1:17:26.997
We can talk about
all sorts of things.

1:17:27.031 --> 1:17:29.799
Religion, politics,
the last job.

1:17:32.502 --> 1:17:34.571
The fuck went on
with it, so forth.

1:17:34.604 --> 1:17:36.573
Oh come on, everyone
knows you're busted,

1:17:36.606 --> 1:17:38.241
everyone knows you're jaded.

1:17:38.274 --> 1:17:39.843
- Listen, I ain't busted.
- The love of God,

1:17:39.877 --> 1:17:42.146
make this be your last job.

1:17:45.316 --> 1:17:47.052
I got plenty left in the tank.

1:17:47.084 --> 1:17:48.954
- All right.
- All right.

1:17:48.987 --> 1:17:50.888
I'm going for a piss.

1:17:57.295 --> 1:17:58.496
Ya'll.

1:17:58.530 --> 1:18:00.765
Why the fuck didn't
you back me up, huh?

1:18:00.799 --> 1:18:02.367
You're the one sewing doubt,

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:04.036
what, abruptly, you're
a fuckin' mute now?

1:18:04.070 --> 1:18:06.204
Motherfucker, don't
even go there with me.

1:18:06.237 --> 1:18:08.306
I'm not her, you need me.

1:18:09.641 --> 1:18:11.376
So don't piss me off.

1:18:24.091 --> 1:18:25.257
Screwdriver.

1:18:27.027 --> 1:18:29.763
It's called that
cause years ago,

1:18:29.796 --> 1:18:33.433
back in the Persian Gulf,
the guy who concocted it,

1:18:33.467 --> 1:18:35.970
used a screwdriver to stir it.

1:18:44.412 --> 1:18:47.082
Ever had a screw, driver before?

1:18:48.616 --> 1:18:49.450
Oh.

1:18:51.987 --> 1:18:53.354
You wicked, huh?

1:19:22.552 --> 1:19:27.557
Hey man, I think we should
get the gun and leave.

1:19:27.590 --> 1:19:30.260
The atmosphere don't feel right.

1:19:31.529 --> 1:19:34.265
There's nothin'
to worry about.

1:19:51.984 --> 1:19:53.119
How's that?

1:19:53.152 --> 1:19:54.886
Stiff one.

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:56.722
No, I don't drink and drive.

1:19:56.755 --> 1:19:59.591
Wouldn't wanna
kill a young kid.

1:20:01.127 --> 1:20:02.294
What's that?

1:20:04.263 --> 1:20:05.966
Go ahead, you gonna sit
on your little perch

1:20:05.999 --> 1:20:08.568
and chirp all night long?

1:20:08.601 --> 1:20:10.938
Why don't you go home
and sleep, old man?

1:20:10.971 --> 1:20:12.538
Got a big day tomorrow.

1:20:12.572 --> 1:20:16.409
Saida, can you give
us the gun so we can go?

1:20:17.877 --> 1:20:19.913
Ah, that's cute.

1:20:19.948 --> 1:20:21.915
You think cause we
fuck, you control me?

1:20:21.950 --> 1:20:24.451
- I'm just sayin'.
- Do me a favour,

1:20:24.485 --> 1:20:25.319
don't say.

1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:31.226
And as for your derision's
and accusations, you're done.

1:20:33.293 --> 1:20:34.661
You know, there comes
a time when even

1:20:34.695 --> 1:20:37.532
the greatest of
athlete's careers wane,

1:20:37.565 --> 1:20:39.868
he just can't run no more.

1:20:39.901 --> 1:20:42.337
He can't hit a ball as
far, can't swing a punch,

1:20:42.370 --> 1:20:43.538
he can't fuck.

1:20:44.706 --> 1:20:46.674
He takes his golden
fuckin' handshake

1:20:46.708 --> 1:20:50.845
and he goes off into the
history books of discardedment.

1:20:50.879 --> 1:20:53.116
Then sometime, 20,
30 down the line,

1:20:53.150 --> 1:20:54.583
some guys are sittin'
around a table,

1:20:54.617 --> 1:20:57.053
talking about the great
boxers and one of them goes,

1:20:57.087 --> 1:20:59.288
remember Joe Lewis?

1:20:59.321 --> 1:21:04.293
And the other one goes, ah
him, from the olden days, yeah.

1:21:04.326 --> 1:21:07.731
He was good but he
weren't no Mike Tyson.

1:21:09.167 --> 1:21:12.869
Fuck you and your fuckin'
set of feminist morals.

1:21:12.903 --> 1:21:15.806
- Oh, don't go there.
- Shut the fuck up!

1:21:15.839 --> 1:21:19.110
You didn't say shit
before, fuck you too.

1:21:19.143 --> 1:21:21.611
It's a gender thing, huh?

1:21:21.645 --> 1:21:25.817
You upset because I control
your narrative and I got tits?

1:21:25.850 --> 1:21:28.053
I've seen more balls on a unic.

1:21:28.086 --> 1:21:31.389
Take your fuckin' rookie,
take your fuckin' gun

1:21:31.422 --> 1:21:33.524
and then go fuck off
into the annals of time,

1:21:33.558 --> 1:21:35.860
you fucking jaded asshole.

1:21:35.893 --> 1:21:38.896
Is that what you
countin' on, huh?

1:21:38.930 --> 1:21:42.367
You countin' on these
kids you be groomin'.

1:21:42.401 --> 1:21:45.437
How they gon' grow up
and become Mike Tyson.

1:21:45.470 --> 1:21:47.539
Pigeons and all that.

1:21:47.573 --> 1:21:51.244
When the truth is, you
out here killin' 'em?

1:21:52.911 --> 1:21:54.981
Trying to prove your worth,

1:21:55.014 --> 1:21:56.482
cause you ain't got none.

1:21:56.516 --> 1:21:59.352
Ah, the fuckin' rumours,
I set you straight on those.

1:21:59.385 --> 1:22:03.857
Yeah I killed a kid, he stole
from me, I'd do it again.

1:22:03.890 --> 1:22:06.260
Damn, that's fucked up.

1:22:06.293 --> 1:22:07.527
Where's your fucking
sense of sisterhood?

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:10.496
Oh, oh, I'm just
here for the money.

1:22:10.530 --> 1:22:12.800
Y'all motherfuckers got
some Billy Jean King

1:22:12.833 --> 1:22:15.070
vs Bobby Riggs shit goin' on.

1:22:15.103 --> 1:22:16.370
Y'all need to
simmer the fuck down

1:22:16.403 --> 1:22:18.240
before someone get hurt.

1:22:18.273 --> 1:22:20.541
So what of it, Saida, huh?

1:22:21.542 --> 1:22:24.045
Since you out here confessin'.

1:22:25.213 --> 1:22:27.415
I swindled jewellers,

1:22:27.449 --> 1:22:30.219
get out clean,
then all a sudden,

1:22:31.386 --> 1:22:35.924
these porkchops got they
fingers all over me.

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:39.461
Gettin' me on this
charge and that charge.

1:22:40.462 --> 1:22:43.099
Sending me up for the big house.

1:22:45.035 --> 1:22:48.537
You gon' tell me you
didn't do that to me?

1:22:50.340 --> 1:22:52.408
You didn't do that to me?

1:22:57.381 --> 1:22:59.783
And fuck yeah, I'm a veteran.

1:23:01.752 --> 1:23:03.553
Long, tall, I'm a vet.

1:23:07.358 --> 1:23:09.593
Seasoned but I ain't jaded.

1:23:11.528 --> 1:23:15.166
And you, fuckin' audacity,
to call me jaded.

1:23:17.735 --> 1:23:19.470
Joe fuckin' Lewis?

1:23:19.504 --> 1:23:21.773
Trying to curtain
me as washed up?

1:23:21.806 --> 1:23:23.841
You're a fuckin' dilettante.

1:23:23.875 --> 1:23:26.145
I'm out here gettin'
my hands dirty.

1:23:26.178 --> 1:23:28.613
I'm Mike Tyson, motherfucker.

1:23:30.015 --> 1:23:33.420
Yeah, yeah, you sit on
your fuckin' pink throne,

1:23:33.452 --> 1:23:36.022
collecting off of my hard work.

1:23:42.461 --> 1:23:45.831
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to have this bunny.

1:23:45.864 --> 1:23:47.734
My family actually gave
it the name, Bunny,

1:23:47.767 --> 1:23:51.238
fuckin' imaginative,
I loved that rabbit.

1:23:51.272 --> 1:23:53.274
One day, Bunny was gone.

1:23:54.674 --> 1:23:57.144
My mother, she tells me
she gave Bunny to a friend,

1:23:57.178 --> 1:23:59.246
but I knew the truth.

1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:01.748
My mother was a decent woman,

1:24:01.781 --> 1:24:04.453
she knew Bunny was old, in pain.

1:24:08.223 --> 1:24:11.393
She put it out of
it's fuckin' misery.

1:24:13.494 --> 1:24:16.198
Gotta tell ya, I ain't
too much thought about

1:24:16.231 --> 1:24:18.000
that Bunny ever since.

1:24:18.033 --> 1:24:19.067
Fuck you.

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.495
We gotta call the cops!

1:24:44.527 --> 1:24:47.331
Somebody please call the cops!

1:24:47.364 --> 1:24:50.968
You guys, come on, you
gotta call the cops!

1:24:51.835 --> 1:24:54.506
Somebody please call the cops!

1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:18.297
We gotta call the cops, we
gotta do something, please!

1:25:29.708 --> 1:25:31.478
Nath, we goin' now?

1:25:42.889 --> 1:25:43.723
Yeah.

1:25:45.592 --> 1:25:46.693
We goin' now.

1:26:12.021 --> 1:26:12.921
Nice gun.

1:26:20.230 --> 1:26:21.064
Want it?

1:26:36.846 --> 1:26:37.647
What you doin'?

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:38.516
Hungry.

1:26:39.617 --> 1:26:41.552
Will you stop doing that?

1:26:54.566 --> 1:26:57.068
So, how much money do I get?

1:26:59.539 --> 1:27:01.007
Five percent.

1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:03.609
I should really
get 50 percent.

1:27:03.643 --> 1:27:06.479
I mean, full disclosure
now, you know,

1:27:06.512 --> 1:27:08.481
since we're working together.

1:27:08.514 --> 1:27:09.582
Since we're a team.

1:27:09.615 --> 1:27:10.983
Oh, not working together.

1:27:11.017 --> 1:27:12.018
Since we're besties.

1:27:12.051 --> 1:27:13.486
- No, we are not a team.
- Yep.

1:27:13.519 --> 1:27:14.353
Mhm, no.

1:27:19.193 --> 1:27:20.927
I lied, earlier on.

1:27:22.629 --> 1:27:26.567
I didn't come here to get the
money from my dad's account.

1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:28.768
I came to get his address.

1:27:29.936 --> 1:27:32.940
I wanted to find out
why he didn't want me.

1:27:32.974 --> 1:27:34.442
You know what,
I'm a good person,

1:27:34.475 --> 1:27:36.743
why wouldn't he want me, why
would he choose money over me?

1:27:36.777 --> 1:27:37.844
People are fucked.

1:27:37.878 --> 1:27:39.447
Can't be as simple as that.

1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:40.315
It is.

1:27:41.748 --> 1:27:43.218
People are fucked.

1:27:45.987 --> 1:27:46.887
No one cares.

1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:48.090
That's not true, my mum cares,

1:27:48.123 --> 1:27:50.426
she's just, she
just cares too much.

1:27:50.459 --> 1:27:51.493
She cares about herself.

1:27:51.527 --> 1:27:52.528
You don't know her.

1:27:52.561 --> 1:27:54.729
People are not selfless.

1:27:56.898 --> 1:27:58.167
My dad, my dad,

1:28:00.336 --> 1:28:03.073
he, he got himself
thrown in jail

1:28:04.207 --> 1:28:06.977
and then OD'd there
when I was 12.

1:28:07.010 --> 1:28:10.879
I spent most of my life in
and out of foster homes.

1:28:10.913 --> 1:28:12.415
Shit foster homes.

1:28:13.882 --> 1:28:18.154
People tellin' me they
love me in spite of,

1:28:18.188 --> 1:28:20.957
always in spite
of, always tainted.

1:28:20.992 --> 1:28:22.560
One of these foster parents used

1:28:22.593 --> 1:28:24.861
to hit me so hard,
my skin would bleed.

1:28:24.894 --> 1:28:26.930
I'd hide in the
cupboard and say my name

1:28:26.964 --> 1:28:28.399
over and over and over again

1:28:28.432 --> 1:28:31.068
until the pain was gone.

1:28:31.102 --> 1:28:32.869
Block out everything.

1:28:35.173 --> 1:28:38.843
The guy, asshole husband,
I forget his name,

1:28:40.445 --> 1:28:41.879
he was the worst.

1:28:43.048 --> 1:28:45.484
He'd hit me, he'd
call me stupid.

1:28:48.220 --> 1:28:49.954
One day I stole a
hammer from the shed,

1:28:49.988 --> 1:28:52.492
big one, could barely lift it.

1:28:54.227 --> 1:28:57.063
And I smashed his
fuckin' head in.

1:29:00.033 --> 1:29:03.303
And then I hit him
a couple more times.

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:08.908
Did he die?

1:29:16.283 --> 1:29:17.884
I don't remember.

1:29:23.124 --> 1:29:23.957
My dad.

1:29:26.027 --> 1:29:28.697
He should've been a preacher.

1:29:28.730 --> 1:29:30.898
You said that already and it
doesn't mean everybody else.

1:29:30.931 --> 1:29:32.167
Said what already?

1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:33.568
You're 16, you've
got plenty of time

1:29:33.601 --> 1:29:35.003
to get like this.

1:29:35.036 --> 1:29:37.038
Your dad being a preacher
and I'm not like that,

1:29:37.072 --> 1:29:38.306
I'm not fucked.

1:29:40.343 --> 1:29:43.279
When I see my dad, I'll
move forward, be able

1:29:43.312 --> 1:29:45.914
to close that
chapter in my life.

1:29:45.947 --> 1:29:47.516
No spite, no anger.

1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:52.887
You're defined by your actions.

1:29:52.921 --> 1:29:55.359
No, I'm defined by my race.

1:29:55.392 --> 1:29:57.594
No one is racist nowadays,
your actions define you.

1:29:58.628 --> 1:30:00.797
I'm sorry, I'm confused,

1:30:02.399 --> 1:30:04.234
what the fuck are
you talking about?

1:30:04.267 --> 1:30:05.669
We're in a new world, okay,

1:30:05.702 --> 1:30:08.238
so I think if you feel
oppressed, your mind

1:30:08.271 --> 1:30:10.540
is clearly living in
the past, you know?

1:30:10.574 --> 1:30:13.277
Self slavery, Gen Z, we're.

1:30:13.311 --> 1:30:15.813
Let's, let's, let's move on.

1:30:17.215 --> 1:30:20.184
Geez, I'm debating race
with a fuckin' 12 year old.

1:30:20.218 --> 1:30:22.653
The fuck I done with my life?

1:30:26.992 --> 1:30:30.262
Got anymore of that chocolate?

1:30:30.295 --> 1:30:35.033
There's none, Jane
Perkin's must be on a diet.

1:30:35.067 --> 1:30:36.168
What time is it?

1:30:36.201 --> 1:30:38.871
- Uh, 10 PM.
- Where's this car?

1:30:42.976 --> 1:30:44.644
There's no other exits.

1:30:44.677 --> 1:30:45.678
Maybe a vent?

1:30:45.712 --> 1:30:48.615
- Where?
- I, I, I don't know.

1:30:48.648 --> 1:30:50.350
I'm thinkin' out loud.

1:30:50.383 --> 1:30:52.886
The front door, it's so risky.

1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:14.542
You gonna leave me?

1:31:15.444 --> 1:31:17.446
What are you talking about?

1:31:17.479 --> 1:31:19.947
After, when we leave the bank,

1:31:19.981 --> 1:31:22.684
are you just gonna leave me?

1:31:22.717 --> 1:31:24.419
Well, yeah.

1:31:24.453 --> 1:31:27.055
You go back to your
mom with your cut,

1:31:27.088 --> 1:31:28.690
I drive some place.

1:31:30.158 --> 1:31:31.594
Don't know where.

1:31:33.496 --> 1:31:34.931
Can I come with you?

1:31:34.997 --> 1:31:36.299
Of course not.

1:31:37.934 --> 1:31:39.435
You're 16, I'm 28.

1:31:42.104 --> 1:31:45.608
You've got your whole
life ahead of ya.

1:31:45.641 --> 1:31:48.445
We're from different places.

1:31:48.479 --> 1:31:51.381
You've got
opportunities, a future.

1:31:58.422 --> 1:32:00.824
There's gotta be other exits.

1:32:08.132 --> 1:32:12.203
Nath wanted to die,
become a villain, a martyr.

1:32:13.938 --> 1:32:17.642
Maybe I should become a
villain, a super villain.

1:32:17.675 --> 1:32:18.944
What'd you say?

1:32:18.979 --> 1:32:22.147
- I said maybe I should become a villain.
- No, before that.

1:32:22.181 --> 1:32:24.350
Listen, why don't you
just shut your mouth?

1:32:24.383 --> 1:32:26.252
You're a kid, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1:32:26.285 --> 1:32:27.586
The thing is not
necessarily true

1:32:27.620 --> 1:32:30.089
because a man dies
for it, Oscar Wilde.

1:32:30.122 --> 1:32:32.024
Who's that, your dad?

1:32:34.727 --> 1:32:37.597
I thought you
didn't wanna leave.

1:32:37.631 --> 1:32:39.199
I thought you wanted to kill me,

1:32:39.232 --> 1:32:40.934
now you wanna leave?

1:32:40.967 --> 1:32:42.168
The fuck wrong with you?

1:32:42.202 --> 1:32:44.170
Do you even know what
day of the week it is?

1:32:44.204 --> 1:32:45.572
I'm warning you.

1:32:45.605 --> 1:32:47.741
You're stupid.

1:32:47.774 --> 1:32:49.309
You're still that same child

1:32:49.342 --> 1:32:51.679
that used to hide
in the basement.

1:32:51.712 --> 1:32:54.682
- Yeah, you're weak.
- I'm weak?

1:32:54.715 --> 1:32:56.551
- Yeah.
- I'm weak.

1:32:56.584 --> 1:32:59.387
- You're so stupid!
- Shut the fuck up!

1:32:59.420 --> 1:33:00.555
Go on, call your dad, call 'em.

1:33:00.588 --> 1:33:02.056
I don't wanna, I don't wanna!

1:33:02.089 --> 1:33:02.890
I'm weak?

1:33:02.924 --> 1:33:04.525
Fuck you, I'm weak!

1:33:05.860 --> 1:33:08.964
You're a little girl,
a fuckin' child.

1:33:08.998 --> 1:33:13.569
You, you ain't been through
what I been through.

1:33:13.602 --> 1:33:15.337
You wanna trade places, hm?

1:33:15.370 --> 1:33:18.574
- See the kind of life I live?
- Absolutely not!

1:33:18.607 --> 1:33:19.508
Then why are you here?

1:33:19.541 --> 1:33:21.010
Cause you got me hostage.

1:33:21.044 --> 1:33:24.280
Well, we just plans
to fuckin' leave.

1:33:36.926 --> 1:33:38.829
Everyone else leaves.

1:33:49.707 --> 1:33:53.844
Look, we can start
this journey together.

1:33:53.877 --> 1:33:56.615
- Really?
- Yeah, things go, yeah.

1:33:56.648 --> 1:33:57.882
Maybe, but you,

1:34:05.256 --> 1:34:08.193
how did you know his name?

1:34:08.226 --> 1:34:09.361
Nath.

1:34:09.394 --> 1:34:11.031
Oh, yeah, you
mentioned it earlier.

1:34:11.064 --> 1:34:12.632
No, I never said it.

1:34:12.665 --> 1:34:15.501
- Yeah, see, you said.
- I always called him Quint.

1:34:15.534 --> 1:34:17.570
You also said you
knew my name, huh?

1:34:17.603 --> 1:34:20.306
How do you know my name, huh?

1:34:20.339 --> 1:34:22.708
Have you been working
with him from the start?

1:34:22.742 --> 1:34:24.810
Is that why you want the money?

1:34:24.844 --> 1:34:27.280
Who do you work for, are
you workin' for Lisa?

1:34:27.314 --> 1:34:30.018
Yeah, her two, you know,
she loves him so much.

1:34:30.051 --> 1:34:31.952
Stop fuckin' with me.

1:34:42.329 --> 1:34:43.831
Mr. You.

1:34:45.833 --> 1:34:49.038
Who's the next contestant
on the Price is Right, baby?

1:34:49.071 --> 1:34:50.872
Would you like a new car,
cause I got a new car

1:34:50.905 --> 1:34:53.108
out here for you kids,
how you gettin' along?

1:34:53.142 --> 1:34:54.442
Good.

1:34:54.475 --> 1:34:55.943
I wanna get the fuck outta here.

1:34:55.977 --> 1:34:57.478
You sound
agitated, Mr. You.

1:34:57.512 --> 1:34:59.581
I'm scared, he's
trying to kill me.

1:34:59.615 --> 1:35:02.951
You're against me, all
of you, I know you are.

1:35:02.985 --> 1:35:04.319
Why did
I just hear her say

1:35:04.353 --> 1:35:05.989
that you're gonna kill her,
did you try to kill her?

1:35:06.022 --> 1:35:08.390
You tell me my car's
outside, lure me out, kill me?

1:35:08.424 --> 1:35:11.627
She says she knows my
name, you're playin'

1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:14.864
like you don't know my name,
you know my fuckin' name.

1:35:14.898 --> 1:35:17.200
You must've seen
my records by now,

1:35:17.233 --> 1:35:19.836
my fuckin' PO files, huh?

1:35:22.238 --> 1:35:24.175
Don't play me like
I'm fuckin' stupid,

1:35:24.207 --> 1:35:26.509
I swear to fuckin' god,
I'll fuckin' kill her.

1:35:26.543 --> 1:35:27.911
I don't
know what's going on.

1:35:27.944 --> 1:35:29.180
I've got my gun
pointed at her right now.

1:35:29.245 --> 1:35:30.413
I believe
you, I believe you.

1:35:30.447 --> 1:35:32.349
Tell me what the
fuck's going on?

1:35:32.383 --> 1:35:33.617
Okay, what
do you wanna know?

1:35:33.651 --> 1:35:35.386
I'll shoot her, I
swear to fuckin god.

1:35:35.419 --> 1:35:36.787
Start talking.

1:35:36.821 --> 1:35:39.991
- What do you want to know?
- All over the fuckin' wall.

1:35:40.025 --> 1:35:40.825
Talk!

1:35:40.858 --> 1:35:42.760
Okay, Mr. You!

1:35:42.793 --> 1:35:46.965
Don't call me that, I,
you know my fuckin' name!

1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:52.004
You know everything,
stop playin' me.

1:35:52.038 --> 1:35:53.705
Tell me the truth.

1:35:53.739 --> 1:35:55.407
I'm trying
to tell you the.

1:35:55.440 --> 1:35:57.143
- Talk!
- Mr. You, if you.

1:35:57.176 --> 1:35:59.678
Call me that again and
I'll fuckin' shoot her.

1:35:59.711 --> 1:36:03.150
All right,
listen, listen,

1:36:03.183 --> 1:36:05.318
there's a lot to
unpack right now

1:36:05.351 --> 1:36:06.853
but the only thing
that's important

1:36:06.886 --> 1:36:10.690
is that your car is gonna
be here in 10 minutes.

1:36:10.723 --> 1:36:12.192
Let's get you out of there,

1:36:12.226 --> 1:36:14.527
let's get you on the road,
let's get you driving, okay?

1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:16.163
And it is, I gotta tell you,

1:36:16.196 --> 1:36:17.697
the car is fuckin' cherry man,

1:36:17.730 --> 1:36:19.700
everybody out here is callin'
it the batmobile, you know?

1:36:21.401 --> 1:36:23.670
Did you hear that?

1:36:23.704 --> 1:36:24.905
I heard it.

1:36:24.938 --> 1:36:27.341
That's the sound of
my gun being cocked.

1:36:27.374 --> 1:36:29.177
Yeah, I
know that sound.

1:36:29.210 --> 1:36:30.878
Tell me the truth.

1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:35.151
Yeah, fine,
I know some stuff.

1:36:35.184 --> 1:36:38.286
I know your fuckin'
name, woopdidoo, okay?

1:36:38.319 --> 1:36:40.688
I've seen your jacket,
I also happen to know

1:36:40.722 --> 1:36:43.058
all the phone calls
you made to Lisa

1:36:43.092 --> 1:36:45.860
and what she's trying
to get you to do.

1:36:45.894 --> 1:36:48.797
I also know your PO is dead,
I know that Nath Clark,

1:36:48.830 --> 1:36:51.534
your friend that you're
so worked up about,

1:36:51.567 --> 1:36:53.502
is beneath you man.

1:36:53.536 --> 1:36:55.871
That guy's a CI, he's
a criminal informant,

1:36:55.905 --> 1:36:57.840
he's a fuckin'
professional snitch,

1:36:57.873 --> 1:37:01.410
I don't know that he sang
about today's job necessarily,

1:37:01.443 --> 1:37:03.813
I think he was honestly here
to commit suicide by cop.

1:37:03.846 --> 1:37:05.681
- What, he's a snitch?
- But if you are not careful,

1:37:05.714 --> 1:37:07.151
he is gonna take you
fuckin' with him,

1:37:07.185 --> 1:37:08.052
do you understand me?

1:37:08.085 --> 1:37:09.053
- Informant?
- Yes.

1:37:14.357 --> 1:37:15.926
Why'd you shoot him?

1:37:15.959 --> 1:37:19.130
Well, CI's
only belong to one cop,

1:37:19.163 --> 1:37:20.231
that's why they're confidential,

1:37:20.264 --> 1:37:21.865
nobody else knows about it.

1:37:21.898 --> 1:37:23.367
The guy's out here didn't know,

1:37:23.401 --> 1:37:25.103
they just saw bank robbers
so they shot a bank robber.

1:37:25.137 --> 1:37:26.637
Cause he's black,
cause he's black.

1:37:26.671 --> 1:37:28.173
It has nothing to do.

1:37:28.207 --> 1:37:29.440
You see a nigga runnin'
and he must be a criminal.

1:37:29.473 --> 1:37:30.675
He was in the middle
of committing a crime.

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:31.909
It's okay to cheer a
nigga when he's runnin'

1:37:31.943 --> 1:37:33.978
with a ball in his
hand or in his foot,

1:37:34.012 --> 1:37:36.081
or he's a passin' a
baton, but any other time,

1:37:36.114 --> 1:37:38.116
he must be trouble, huh?

1:37:40.752 --> 1:37:44.690
Come on, Mr.
You, let's talk serious.

1:37:46.125 --> 1:37:49.229
I told you not to fuckin' call me
that, now I'm gonna fuckin' kill her.

1:37:49.262 --> 1:37:50.529
No, she's not the one.

1:37:57.037 --> 1:37:59.572
You're a man of
morals, I like that.

1:37:59.606 --> 1:38:01.108
A guy should have morals, right?

1:38:01.141 --> 1:38:03.077
Yeah, definitely.

1:38:03.110 --> 1:38:04.345
A man of morals would
definitely understand

1:38:04.377 --> 1:38:06.512
the basic ethics
of conversation.

1:38:06.546 --> 1:38:08.915
One person speaks,
the other one listens.

1:38:08.948 --> 1:38:10.217
I thought you had finished.

1:38:10.251 --> 1:38:11.619
I had not finished.

1:38:11.652 --> 1:38:12.953
It's just, you
asked a question,

1:38:12.987 --> 1:38:15.156
- I just assumed you.
- You assumed?

1:38:15.190 --> 1:38:17.259
Yeah, I assumed, I
thought you had fin.

1:38:17.292 --> 1:38:18.959
Listen, listen, listen,
let's not start gettin' upset

1:38:18.993 --> 1:38:19.760
and angry with each other.

1:38:19.793 --> 1:38:21.062
I'm not gettin' angry.

1:38:21.096 --> 1:38:22.830
- You're gettin' very angry.
- No I'm not.

1:38:22.863 --> 1:38:24.032
Calm down.

1:38:24.065 --> 1:38:25.900
No, I assure you,
I'm not gettin'.

1:38:25.933 --> 1:38:29.604
Look, what are we gonna do
about the monetary situation?

1:38:29.638 --> 1:38:32.108
I can probably get
it in a couple of days.

1:38:32.141 --> 1:38:34.910
I just need to see
a few people and.

1:38:34.943 --> 1:38:36.279
You know what?

1:38:36.312 --> 1:38:37.913
- Don't worry about it.
- What?

1:38:37.946 --> 1:38:39.382
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Seriously?

1:38:39.414 --> 1:38:42.885
Yeah, I'm feelin' generous,
don't worry about it

1:38:42.919 --> 1:38:45.421
Well that's uh, should I go?

1:38:47.423 --> 1:38:48.557
Yeah, why not Bob?

1:38:50.893 --> 1:38:51.727
Why not?

1:38:56.033 --> 1:38:57.733
Let's get breakfast.

1:38:57.767 --> 1:38:59.337
Breakfast?

1:38:59.370 --> 1:39:04.275
Yeah, pancakes, eggs, bacon,
waffles, toast, whatever.

1:39:04.309 --> 1:39:06.476
Yeah, yeah that's great.

1:39:08.046 --> 1:39:10.048
But maybe we should clean
this body off the street.

1:39:10.081 --> 1:39:11.581
Sure, after breakfast.

1:39:11.615 --> 1:39:12.883
But how 'bout now?

1:39:12.916 --> 1:39:14.118
I don't really wanna get
pinched for something

1:39:14.152 --> 1:39:15.954
as stupid as leaving a
dead body on the street.

1:39:15.987 --> 1:39:18.157
Bill, Bill, Billy, Bill.

1:39:19.490 --> 1:39:23.062
You watch too much TV,
nobody gets arrested anymore.

1:39:23.095 --> 1:39:25.164
Yes, people do.

1:39:25.197 --> 1:39:27.565
Bill, I swear to
God, you touch that,

1:39:27.598 --> 1:39:28.967
I'll be leaving two bodies
on the street whilst

1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.235
I eat pancakes.

1:40:20.589 --> 1:40:23.493
- What's it like, four?
- Say five.

1:40:25.094 --> 1:40:27.763
- Feels like four.
- Four, five.

1:40:40.843 --> 1:40:42.346
Oh, what's this?

1:40:44.214 --> 1:40:45.948
- Taking the gun.
- Cause?

1:40:45.982 --> 1:40:47.418
What's it matter?

1:40:47.451 --> 1:40:49.386
It's my gun, all along.

1:40:49.420 --> 1:40:50.687
Yeah, the thing is.

1:40:50.721 --> 1:40:52.956
- The thing?
- The thing is, I like it.

1:40:52.990 --> 1:40:56.061
I like the keep mementos
of the people I waste.

1:40:56.094 --> 1:40:57.694
There's plenty down there.

1:40:57.728 --> 1:40:59.531
Billy, Billy.

1:40:59.563 --> 1:41:01.166
Why don't you stop
fuckin' about?

1:41:01.199 --> 1:41:02.633
What do you mean?

1:41:02.666 --> 1:41:03.600
Give me the gun.

1:41:03.634 --> 1:41:05.070
No can do.

1:41:05.103 --> 1:41:07.373
I don't get this gun back,

1:41:07.406 --> 1:41:09.141
I'm in with this guy.

1:41:20.718 --> 1:41:24.224
That's twice you've
insulted me tonight.

1:41:25.092 --> 1:41:25.925
How so?

1:41:27.094 --> 1:41:29.628
A. you called
me a crazy person.

1:41:29.662 --> 1:41:31.565
And B. you took my gun.

1:41:33.333 --> 1:41:36.570
Jesus, it's my fucking gun.

1:41:36.635 --> 1:41:39.873
We're still talkin' about this.

1:41:39.906 --> 1:41:41.375
I borrowed this
piece off of someone

1:41:41.409 --> 1:41:46.080
and believe me, you don't
wanna fuck with that person.

1:41:46.114 --> 1:41:48.249
Earlier tonight, you
asked me for a piece,

1:41:48.282 --> 1:41:50.884
I gave you a piece, I said,

1:41:50.917 --> 1:41:52.786
I said I needed it
back, I said that.

1:41:52.819 --> 1:41:55.290
It's like, Jesus, I told you.

1:41:55.324 --> 1:41:57.992
It's not like I didn't tell you.

1:42:00.529 --> 1:42:03.631
You know, you're
unprofessional.

1:42:03.664 --> 1:42:07.169
Your partner wants a
tool, and you refuse.

1:42:08.170 --> 1:42:08.970
What?

1:42:10.939 --> 1:42:13.576
You fuckin' kidding me?

1:42:13.610 --> 1:42:15.644
You shoot a guy in
the street and then go

1:42:15.677 --> 1:42:17.547
and have fuckin' pancakes
while his dead fuckin' body

1:42:17.580 --> 1:42:20.316
bleeds out and I'm
unprofessional?

1:42:23.019 --> 1:42:24.354
Have you got beef with me?

1:42:24.387 --> 1:42:26.923
Yeah, I gotta a
fuckin' beef with you.

1:42:26.956 --> 1:42:29.360
You're fuckin' unhinged, man.

1:42:31.562 --> 1:42:35.798
And by the fuckin' way, we're
not fuckin' partners, okay?

1:42:35.832 --> 1:42:37.234
McGoldrick asked me to
do this job with you

1:42:37.268 --> 1:42:38.801
and I fuckin' begged him not to.

1:42:38.835 --> 1:42:40.904
I said anyone but fuckin' Ant.

1:42:40.937 --> 1:42:43.807
I fuckin' hate
workin' with you, man.

1:42:43.841 --> 1:42:47.379
You're fuckin' unreliable,
you're fuckin' insane

1:42:47.412 --> 1:42:49.414
and you're fuckin' stupid.

1:42:53.051 --> 1:42:53.951
What the fuck?

1:43:54.083 --> 1:43:56.218
You know what, Bill?

1:43:56.252 --> 1:43:58.487
You might be right.

1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:01.290
I think I am clinically insane.

1:44:03.792 --> 1:44:07.130
I mean all this shit
over a fucking gun.

1:44:40.198 --> 1:44:42.301
You're a special bitch.

1:44:46.338 --> 1:44:47.172
Marry me.

1:45:25.913 --> 1:45:28.249
Hurry up, nigga.

1:45:28.283 --> 1:45:29.117
Typical.

1:45:35.256 --> 1:45:38.294
Fuck happened
to my merchandise?

1:45:38.327 --> 1:45:40.196
Just told you, ya know.

1:45:40.229 --> 1:45:41.731
It's uh, you know.

1:45:42.832 --> 1:45:45.634
No, I don't fucking know.

1:45:45.668 --> 1:45:47.869
Why don't you tell me again?

1:45:47.902 --> 1:45:49.338
It works.

1:45:49.372 --> 1:45:50.206
Yeah?

1:45:51.774 --> 1:45:54.077
We better put it to the test.

1:45:54.111 --> 1:45:57.114
Some service here!

1:46:07.190 --> 1:46:09.359
Wanna get some pancakes?

1:46:29.281 --> 1:46:31.450
Is this the getaway car?

1:46:32.684 --> 1:46:34.853
It's a little conspicuous.

1:46:38.590 --> 1:46:40.726
You seen Wages of Fear?

1:46:40.759 --> 1:46:41.593
Nah.

1:46:42.961 --> 1:46:45.799
That's the one about the
trucks or something, ain't it?

1:46:45.832 --> 1:46:47.834
I used to be a mechanic.

1:46:49.402 --> 1:46:51.571
Yeah, you said previous.

1:46:52.705 --> 1:46:55.141
You got a proclivity
for repetition.

1:46:55.175 --> 1:46:57.877
You nervous, you tend
to repeat yourself.

1:46:57.911 --> 1:46:58.846
A little.

1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:01.115
Got your gun?

1:47:04.552 --> 1:47:05.386
Yeah.

1:47:06.854 --> 1:47:08.589
Not sure if it works.

1:47:14.229 --> 1:47:17.399
We won't need to use
it though, right?

1:47:25.340 --> 1:47:27.342
Nath, last night, Saida.

1:47:31.514 --> 1:47:33.282
What the fuck happened to her?

1:47:33.316 --> 1:47:34.116
This fuckin' gun.

1:47:34.150 --> 1:47:35.918
Don't call me Nath.

1:47:37.153 --> 1:47:38.855
Now at some point in your life,

1:47:38.888 --> 1:47:40.056
you gon' have to face up to

1:47:40.089 --> 1:47:42.892
your own
responsibilities, nigga.

1:47:42.925 --> 1:47:45.261
Now I need to know that
you down with this.

1:47:45.294 --> 1:47:49.099
I'm not talkin' no half in,
half out, collation shit.

1:47:49.132 --> 1:47:51.335
I'm talkin' true
Stalin dictatorship,

1:47:51.368 --> 1:47:54.071
red motherfuckin'
state, communism shit.

1:47:54.104 --> 1:47:58.442
You gotta be in this, with
your heart and your head.

1:48:04.649 --> 1:48:05.817
Her fuckin' head.

1:48:05.850 --> 1:48:09.354
Get over it, bitch
deserved to die.

1:48:09.387 --> 1:48:12.490
Who wears sunglasses
indoors, anyway?

1:48:19.465 --> 1:48:22.902
Story goes, Julius
Ceaser, before he died,

1:48:27.239 --> 1:48:29.642
he left all of his
wealth in the hands

1:48:29.675 --> 1:48:31.443
of a 17 year old boy.

1:48:33.012 --> 1:48:35.849
Octavian, later
known as Augustus.

1:48:39.719 --> 1:48:41.388
Wasn't even related.

1:48:42.656 --> 1:48:45.559
By doing so, by
making that choice,

1:48:48.395 --> 1:48:50.364
his legacy was more far reachin'

1:48:50.398 --> 1:48:52.967
than if he had lived 100 years.

1:49:07.583 --> 1:49:08.917
Let's do the do.

1:49:57.936 --> 1:49:59.371
Get out of the way!

1:50:07.345 --> 1:50:09.180
Listen to me,
listen to me right now Wyatt,

1:50:09.214 --> 1:50:13.252
you have control over
what happens next.

1:50:14.487 --> 1:50:16.222
Fuck it, fuck!

1:50:16.255 --> 1:50:17.189
Wyatt?

1:50:20.693 --> 1:50:22.461
I know today hasn't
gone exactly the way

1:50:22.495 --> 1:50:24.830
that you wanted it to.

1:50:24.864 --> 1:50:26.533
Make that my life.

1:50:26.566 --> 1:50:29.137
Right, but your car
is gonna be here any minute,

1:50:29.169 --> 1:50:32.706
I swear to god it is,
and I think we both know

1:50:32.739 --> 1:50:34.341
that I can't let you leave in it

1:50:34.374 --> 1:50:37.344
but that car is yours, man.

1:50:37.377 --> 1:50:39.913
You know, give me the
girl, do your time

1:50:39.946 --> 1:50:42.117
and the car will be
yours when you get out.

1:50:42.151 --> 1:50:43.918
Wyatt, what a name.

1:50:46.121 --> 1:50:49.323
What, what, what kind
of a black man names

1:50:49.357 --> 1:50:51.659
his own kid Wyatt?

1:50:54.996 --> 1:50:56.197
That's.

1:50:58.134 --> 1:51:01.570
My dad, he had it in
for me from the beginning.

1:51:03.305 --> 1:51:05.541
Come on man, you're
gonna get me in trouble.

1:51:05.574 --> 1:51:07.409
If I agree with you on
an open walkie channel,

1:51:07.443 --> 1:51:09.211
somebody's gonna call me racist.

1:51:09.244 --> 1:51:10.713
- That's an irony.
- Oh shit.

1:51:10.746 --> 1:51:13.950
You shot the nigga
that was with you.

1:51:15.086 --> 1:51:17.987
That's, that's,
that's poetic justice.

1:51:18.021 --> 1:51:20.191
You shot the house nigga.

1:51:23.094 --> 1:51:25.328
We don't
have put it that way.

1:51:28.698 --> 1:51:32.002
That's poetic
justice, circle of life.

1:51:33.637 --> 1:51:37.109
Got shot, he got shot by
the people he was helping.

1:51:37.142 --> 1:51:40.745
Well I'm glad you're finding
the whole situation so funny.

1:51:41.746 --> 1:51:44.182
- So you comin' out?
- You're right.

1:51:44.216 --> 1:51:46.251
He did wanna die,
the fuckin' martyr.

1:51:46.284 --> 1:51:47.819
Hey man, at
the end of the day,

1:51:47.853 --> 1:51:49.387
none of us is perfect.

1:51:49.421 --> 1:51:52.557
I mean, my fuckin'
wife drags me into

1:51:52.591 --> 1:51:54.726
this therapist that
I have to pay for.

1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:56.195
Fuck your wife.

1:51:57.596 --> 1:52:00.699
Okay, if you don't fuckin'
like her, then leave.

1:52:00.732 --> 1:52:03.803
Stop bringing her up,
bitchin' about her, moanin',

1:52:03.836 --> 1:52:06.073
I'm sick of it, I'm
fuckin' sick of it.

1:52:06.106 --> 1:52:07.540
Listen.

1:52:07.573 --> 1:52:10.443
Fuck, why is he
a fuckin' snitch?

1:52:11.744 --> 1:52:15.047
Oh fuckin' asshole,
fuck, why, why, why?

1:52:18.719 --> 1:52:20.053
Why, why, why?

1:52:20.088 --> 1:52:20.888
I don't.

1:52:22.190 --> 1:52:25.260
Fuckin' suicide
mission motherfucker.

1:52:28.229 --> 1:52:32.499
Hey, Wyatt, I
know you don't wanna hear me

1:52:32.533 --> 1:52:34.302
mention her name but,

1:52:35.737 --> 1:52:37.472
just between us and
whoever the fuck else

1:52:37.505 --> 1:52:41.177
is listening, I'm
cheating on my wife, okay?

1:52:43.444 --> 1:52:44.913
Honestly, I don't
think she cares because

1:52:44.946 --> 1:52:46.648
I'm pretty sure she's
cheating on me too,

1:52:46.681 --> 1:52:50.519
I guess what I'm trying to say,
and I hope you're listening,

1:52:50.553 --> 1:52:55.125
is that we're all, all of us
are shit morally speaking.

1:52:58.261 --> 1:52:59.795
Okay?

1:52:59.829 --> 1:53:03.066
Let the girl go, do your time.

1:53:03.099 --> 1:53:04.567
Nobody's been
killed in there yet,

1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:08.038
I can still get
you that two years.

1:53:08.072 --> 1:53:11.275
I'll let her go,
give me my car.

1:53:11.309 --> 1:53:14.312
You got it, I'll
have it here in five minutes.

1:53:27.525 --> 1:53:29.961
You said, Nath, I'm scared.

1:53:31.829 --> 1:53:35.100
He shouted at you and said
if you use his real name

1:53:35.133 --> 1:53:38.904
one more time, he'll
fucking kill you.

1:53:38.937 --> 1:53:40.372
Do you remember?

1:53:40.405 --> 1:53:41.241
I, I,

1:53:44.110 --> 1:53:46.612
I sometimes, I say things and,

1:53:50.883 --> 1:53:52.318
I can't remember.

1:54:00.261 --> 1:54:01.928
I lied earlier on.

1:54:13.974 --> 1:54:16.810
That's your super
villain power.

1:54:18.479 --> 1:54:19.314
Lying.

1:54:23.050 --> 1:54:24.718
I did see a clerk.

1:54:26.922 --> 1:54:29.191
I made up this whole story.

1:54:31.193 --> 1:54:34.363
About how me and my
dad were shopping,

1:54:35.497 --> 1:54:38.500
we got separated
and I lost my phone.

1:54:42.105 --> 1:54:44.440
The lady gave me his number.

1:54:45.708 --> 1:54:47.043
So I called him.

1:54:53.749 --> 1:54:55.319
You're a hostage.

1:54:56.686 --> 1:54:58.689
You've just been told you're
probably gonna be shot

1:54:58.722 --> 1:55:00.557
and you call your dad?

1:55:04.362 --> 1:55:07.332
Not your mom, who loves you?

1:55:07.365 --> 1:55:08.266
Your words.

1:55:11.436 --> 1:55:13.171
I just don't, get it,

1:55:16.241 --> 1:55:19.711
I just don't, I
don't understand.

1:55:19.744 --> 1:55:22.947
Fuckin' human race,
I, I don't, I just.

1:55:34.626 --> 1:55:36.528
I'm tired, man, I just.

1:55:43.303 --> 1:55:46.073
Why'd you try and
help me escape?

1:55:49.276 --> 1:55:51.445
I wanted you to like me.

1:55:53.813 --> 1:55:55.715
I need someone to like me,

1:55:55.749 --> 1:55:57.684
I need you to not leave me.

1:55:57.717 --> 1:55:59.453
Please don't leave me.

1:56:03.791 --> 1:56:07.028
Please, please,
please, please, please.

1:56:08.196 --> 1:56:11.199
I need you to like
me, please like me.

1:56:14.369 --> 1:56:15.936
I'm not your dad.

1:56:32.054 --> 1:56:34.624
Just, I get confused sometimes.

1:56:40.930 --> 1:56:42.832
Nothing means anything.

1:56:45.034 --> 1:56:47.104
Everything means nothing.

1:57:21.774 --> 1:57:23.376
Dad, hey it's me.

1:57:26.879 --> 1:57:30.417
Yeah, I'm sorry, I think
I got cut off earlier.

1:57:30.450 --> 1:57:32.119
Yeah, I'm on the TV?

1:57:38.192 --> 1:57:39.025
I'm fine.

1:57:41.162 --> 1:57:43.498
I'll be out soon, I promise.

1:57:47.401 --> 1:57:48.236
Dad?

1:57:55.077 --> 1:57:56.911
Why don't you want me?

1:58:06.622 --> 1:58:08.022
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1:58:19.668 --> 1:58:22.605
You still don't
remember me, do you?

1:58:24.907 --> 1:58:27.178
We've crossed paths before.

1:58:30.181 --> 1:58:33.917
You ran past me and my
mom about a month ago.

1:58:34.951 --> 1:58:37.555
When you did, I felt something.

1:58:46.498 --> 1:58:47.332
What?

1:58:58.977 --> 1:58:59.911
Relieved.

1:59:23.503 --> 1:59:26.306
Look at that, a
'70 to '75 BMW CSL.

1:59:29.977 --> 1:59:31.745
Launched the M brand.

1:59:33.880 --> 1:59:35.216
Thing of beauty.

1:59:37.017 --> 1:59:38.219
See that, boy?

1:59:43.790 --> 1:59:46.629
Where did you get
that, sweet boy?

1:59:48.796 --> 1:59:51.400
Did you steal it from the shop?

1:59:55.069 --> 1:59:57.706
Listen to me very
carefully, son.

1:59:57.740 --> 1:59:59.541
You listening?

1:59:59.575 --> 2:00:02.679
What I always told
you about privilege.

2:00:02.712 --> 2:00:04.046
It can be taken.

2:00:06.249 --> 2:00:07.484
It is for sale.

2:00:10.253 --> 2:00:14.324
Don't give it to you,
you gotta take it.

2:00:14.357 --> 2:00:17.595
One dime at a time,
one blow at a time.

2:00:19.263 --> 2:00:22.767
And if they resist,
if they stand up tall,

2:00:24.568 --> 2:00:27.904
if they refuse to share
with you the spoils,

2:00:27.937 --> 2:00:29.273
shoot them down.

2:00:38.049 --> 2:00:40.885
No one act is
without consequence.

2:00:44.456 --> 2:00:47.024
That is the symmetry of life.

2:00:47.058 --> 2:00:49.462
It is comic, that being said,

2:00:51.664 --> 2:00:56.536
you steal again, I'm gonna
beat the livin' life outta ya.

2:01:02.608 --> 2:01:04.444
All things
come to an end.

2:01:12.786 --> 2:01:15.522
Wyatt, my
man, your car is here.

2:01:15.556 --> 2:01:18.692
Show me a picture,
no, a video.

2:01:18.726 --> 2:01:21.962
Yes sir, Master Bruce.

2:01:24.232 --> 2:01:27.569
There you go, you
see it, we all good?

2:01:27.602 --> 2:01:29.571
Okay listen, now things
have changed a little bit

2:01:29.604 --> 2:01:32.707
so I, I can't hold the
boys back much longer.

2:01:32.741 --> 2:01:35.176
I need you to go ahead
and come on out now.

2:01:35.210 --> 2:01:36.944
Like right now.

2:01:36.977 --> 2:01:38.414
What's changed?

2:01:39.615 --> 2:01:42.351
Come on, man,
just come on out.

2:01:43.486 --> 2:01:44.986
Sure, we're comin' out.

2:01:45.019 --> 2:01:45.920
Okay that's
great, everybody,

2:01:45.954 --> 2:01:47.456
I need you to hold your fire,

2:01:47.490 --> 2:01:49.991
he is coming out peacefully
and surrendering,

2:01:50.024 --> 2:01:52.161
does everybody hear me?

2:01:52.194 --> 2:01:53.530
I got another
call coming through.

2:01:53.563 --> 2:01:55.766
Wait no,
Wyatt, is it Lisa?

2:01:55.799 --> 2:01:57.134
Do not take that call.

2:01:57.167 --> 2:01:58.502
All right, don't take it, just.

2:01:58.535 --> 2:02:00.771
- Why?
- Come out and get in your car stay on the phone with me.

2:02:00.804 --> 2:02:03.507
- I gotta go.
- Don't take the fuck!

2:02:06.109 --> 2:02:07.943
Nath, he, um.

2:02:11.215 --> 2:02:13.584
- Right.
- 10 minutes ago, so.

2:02:14.786 --> 2:02:17.155
He was a CI, you know that?

2:02:18.556 --> 2:02:20.825
Oh damn, I did not.

2:02:22.260 --> 2:02:23.694
You got my money?

2:02:24.961 --> 2:02:27.965
I thought you were
meant to fix shit.

2:02:27.999 --> 2:02:32.204
Lisa, with an S, that's
how you packaged yourself.

2:02:32.237 --> 2:02:33.906
Yeah well,
I can't fix a body.

2:02:33.938 --> 2:02:35.006
Call me.

2:02:35.039 --> 2:02:36.575
I fix shit.

2:02:36.608 --> 2:02:38.544
What do you expect
me to bring him back to life?

2:02:38.577 --> 2:02:39.411
You ass...

2:02:44.049 --> 2:02:48.987
Hey man, I assume
you know about Nath now, right?

2:02:51.357 --> 2:02:54.494
Listen, you gotta let her go.

2:02:54.527 --> 2:02:57.264
You gotta come out,
just like you promised.

2:02:57.298 --> 2:03:00.634
You can still drive
off into the sunset.

2:03:01.769 --> 2:03:05.840
I think I've accepted
this is how it ends.

2:03:05.873 --> 2:03:08.909
My whole life, people have
told me left is right,

2:03:08.943 --> 2:03:10.110
right is left.

2:03:12.613 --> 2:03:14.883
I was born for this moment.

2:03:16.551 --> 2:03:20.020
Come on man,
the big guy upstairs,

2:03:20.054 --> 2:03:22.491
that's not how he works.

2:03:22.524 --> 2:03:23.959
When we fuck up, it's on us.

2:03:23.991 --> 2:03:28.296
I, I have fucked up a lot
and I chose all of it.

2:03:28.330 --> 2:03:30.466
It doesn't matter.

2:03:30.500 --> 2:03:33.169
What do you fuckin'
mean it doesn't matter?

2:03:33.202 --> 2:03:35.404
It matters a whole hell of a lot to
that girl that's in there with you,

2:03:35.438 --> 2:03:36.839
it matters to me.

2:03:38.006 --> 2:03:39.442
How can you be like this?

2:03:39.475 --> 2:03:40.676
How can you quit on yourself?

2:03:40.710 --> 2:03:44.012
Because, it's time
I become a lighthouse.

2:03:46.884 --> 2:03:50.153
What the
fuck does that mean?

2:03:50.187 --> 2:03:52.823
Just, I don't know
what that means, Wyatt.

2:03:52.856 --> 2:03:56.460
Just come out here,
get in this fuckin' car

2:03:56.493 --> 2:03:57.895
I got you because
they are gonna storm

2:03:57.928 --> 2:04:00.230
this place and I
can't stop them.

2:04:00.264 --> 2:04:03.601
They're going to come in, just.

2:04:03.635 --> 2:04:05.537
- Come on, just go.
- Ultimately,

2:04:05.570 --> 2:04:08.907
everything has the
weight I place on it.

2:04:10.742 --> 2:04:13.076
It's time I made a fuckin'
decision and kept to it.

2:04:13.111 --> 2:04:15.213
Man,
please, don't do this.

2:04:15.246 --> 2:04:17.081
I gotta be a martyr.

2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:30.162
Three times I could've
had this gun tonight,

2:04:30.195 --> 2:04:34.467
but I didn't because I
thought this was your story.

2:04:38.705 --> 2:04:41.975
Fucking die, you
fuckin' black nigger,

2:04:42.008 --> 2:04:43.075
black fucker.

2:04:55.957 --> 2:04:58.492
I gotta say it again.

2:04:58.526 --> 2:04:59.360
Nice gun.

2:05:01.094 --> 2:05:05.033
Madison, the gun doesn't
work properly, okay?

2:05:09.972 --> 2:05:11.807
Give me the gun, okay?

2:05:12.674 --> 2:05:14.009
Give me the gun.

2:05:18.981 --> 2:05:23.086
Madison, listen to me, let
me shoot the gun, okay?

2:05:24.754 --> 2:05:29.292
Ultimately, everything has
the weight I place on it.

2:05:29.325 --> 2:05:33.229
Madison, let me
shoot the gun, okay?

2:05:33.262 --> 2:05:35.565
Let me shoot the gun.

2:05:46.677 --> 2:05:50.414
I do not wish to
shed a drop of blood,

2:05:50.447 --> 2:05:52.783
but I must fight the course.

2:05:53.652 --> 2:05:55.820
Tis all that's left in me.
