00:00.000 --> 00:01.502
[Raelle]
Previously on Motherland...

00:01.502 --> 00:03.170
[Scylla] The Mycelium
has taken her to heal.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.130
I keep sending it
so that she'll know

00:05.130 --> 00:07.382
that I'm looking for her
and that I'll never give up.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.842
We're in this together.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.011
[Scylla] To get to Raelle,
I need to tap into the Mycelium.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.095
[Nicte] Let's how much
you love her.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.597
She just made you weak.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.890
[Scylla]
Raelle's kept me alive.

00:14.890 --> 00:15.766
Prepare the operating room.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.060
[Khalida] Consider yourself
lucky to be making

00:18.060 --> 00:19.561
such a great contribution.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.188
[Khalida]
But I know you'll always

00:21.271 --> 00:22.272
be by our side.
We're sisters now.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.149
-[Tally] How are you here?
-[Adler] The Mother,

00:24.149 --> 00:25.484
she brought me back.

00:25.817 --> 00:26.985
[Tally]
The Camarilla are searching

00:27.027 --> 00:27.986
-for the First Song, too.
-Tally!

00:28.779 --> 00:30.239
[The Marshal]
Explain to me just how long

00:30.530 --> 00:31.573
you thought you could
elude us on our own land?

00:31.573 --> 00:33.242
[Nicte]
Doesn't look like a jail.

00:33.242 --> 00:35.369
I hope you all enjoy your stay.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.080
Move my address
to the nation till tonight.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.082
[M] Woodlot.
Captain Quartermain, check in.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.166
The breach has occurred.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.627
-[screaming]
-[man] Go, go, go!

00:55.722 --> 00:59.393
I do solemnly swear that
I will faithfully execute

00:59.393 --> 01:01.895
the Office of the President
of the United States.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.815
And I will to the best
of my ability preserve,

01:04.815 --> 01:06.233
protect, and defend

01:06.316 --> 01:08.986
the Constitution
of the United States.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.071
Mr. President.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.240
-[applause]
-Thank you.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.286
[clears throat]

01:17.286 --> 01:20.789
Congratulations, Mr. President.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.959
Well, thank you.
Let's get to work, shall we?

01:23.959 --> 01:25.043
Mm-hmm.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.347
[eerie music]

01:43.603 --> 01:45.397
This will be a closed casket.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.909
[opening theme plays]

02:59.388 --> 03:01.181
[Scylla]
I thought I had the right seed.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.392
I was sure I'd get a sign.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.686
She is all right.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.812
We'll find her.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.732
We just have to trust that if
Alder can come back,

03:10.732 --> 03:12.109
Raelle can, too.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.360
I'm sorry, did you say Alder?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.404
[Abigail] Oh, yeah.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.571
Turns out Alder's alive

03:17.239 --> 03:20.367
and scouring the earth looking
for some kind of First Song.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.202
What's a "First Song?"

03:22.202 --> 03:23.620
I'm not totally sure

03:23.954 --> 03:25.539
but Tally has a piece of it
in her pocket.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.542
You're sure it was Alder and
not someone wearing her face?

03:29.042 --> 03:32.921
-[Abigail] Positive.
-She's different, though.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.720
[Petra] Anacostia's been
out of contact for too long.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.681
Where are we on combing
the surveillance footage?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.224
Eighty-five percent complete,

03:44.224 --> 03:47.018
still no sign of Captain
Quartemain or Woodlot.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.689
I want fetches placed on every
one of Silver's cabinet members.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.274
One of them must know something.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.317
The Mycelium's being poisoned,

03:54.317 --> 03:55.360
the President
was just assassinated,

03:55.360 --> 03:57.320
my head of
intelligence is AWOL.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.114
I need answers... now!

03:59.114 --> 04:00.073
General Bellweather.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.285
Happy to hear the urgency.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.120
The sooner we find those
responsible

04:05.120 --> 04:07.497
for President Wade's
tragic death, the better.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.500
Sources tell me there's
evidence of the Witchbomb.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.169
It's too soon to tell,

04:12.169 --> 04:14.045
we're still analyzing
the bomb site, Mr. President.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.883
Care to introduce me
to your companions?

04:17.883 --> 04:19.843
I didn't realize we were
getting new uniforms.

04:19.843 --> 04:23.054
Oh, the witches won't be
getting new uniforms.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.349
These people are part of your
new Civilian Oversight.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.393
-My what?
-[Silver] Yeah.
They will be on base

04:28.393 --> 04:29.811
to help reassure
the American people

04:30.312 --> 04:32.397
that things are running
smoothly during the transition.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.734
Meet your personal oversight.
Colonel Jarrett.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.569
Colonel?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.282
I'm always
happy to work with patriots.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.410
Witch or non-witch.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.205
I'm so pleased
to hear you say that.

[vocalizing]

05:05.096 --> 05:06.515

Okay. Point ambush,

makes his rounds.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.473
You're assuming
there'll be a next time.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.350
Oh, he'll be back.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.935
What does he want, though?

08:38.935 --> 08:40.645
And what was with the goat?

08:41.479 --> 08:44.232
Tally, we're prisoners.
Who cares about the goat?

08:47.569 --> 08:50.071
General Bellweather.
Come in.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.370
You are more than welcome to
join us, Colonel Jarrett,

08:57.370 --> 09:00.623
but I should warn you that
there are frequencies of sound
in here

09:00.623 --> 09:04.252
that could alter
certain organs of yours.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.005
Perhaps you'd prefer to join
my oversight in the hallway?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.715
Would either of you
like a chair?

09:10.633 --> 09:11.634
We'll stand.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.641
[sighs] Thought
I'd never get right of him.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.018
I know you need to
get off base,

09:20.018 --> 09:22.312
but let me show you
something before you go.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.362
Penelope, dear?

09:31.362 --> 09:33.031
Come say hello.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.748
Hello.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.879
Remarkable.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.840
How-- how did you do this?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.259
May I have a glass of milk?

09:57.305 --> 10:00.725
She was infected with a
different strain of Witchplague,

10:00.725 --> 10:03.019
designed to keep her alive
as a host

10:03.019 --> 10:05.313
so she could spread it
throughout the base.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.774
What the Camarilla
didn't account for

10:07.774 --> 10:10.985
is that it worked
a little too well.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.488
It allowed her to remain alive,

10:13.488 --> 10:14.948
in a sense,

10:14.948 --> 10:18.743
in the atmosphere,
riding the humidity,

10:18.743 --> 10:20.537
fully sentient.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.039
I was able to reconstitute her.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.339
[Petra] So she's human?

10:32.257 --> 10:36.010
Essentially, and becoming
more so every day.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.139
If we can unveil her soon, we
can move towards

10:39.139 --> 10:40.598
exonerating my daughter's unit.

10:40.598 --> 10:44.185
Oh. We're not there yet,

10:44.936 --> 10:47.605
-as you can see.
-But I'm thirsty!

10:47.605 --> 10:49.691
She still has violent impulses.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.276
Hence the mittens.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.821
But we're learning
to control those,

10:55.363 --> 10:56.906
aren't we, Penelope?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.677
Our work relationship
was getting tense,

11:18.094 --> 11:21.055
both of us always
having to fake it.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.725
It's better this way.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.185
Now we can both be real.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.769
You wanna talk about real?

11:28.938 --> 11:32.817
You killed your own daughter
for this freak-show.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.777
I didn't kill my daughter

11:35.445 --> 11:39.032
That was your beloved
Bellweather unit, wasn't it?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.491
Well...
[clears throat]

11:41.326 --> 11:42.744
enjoy the party.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.874
You had a luncheon at the
Governor of Georgia's house.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.004
Penelope was only four,
but it was her idea.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.964
She wanted those
training wheels off.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.092
It only took her
one afternoon to learn

11:58.092 --> 11:59.969
because she was so insistent
that she'd be able to show you

11:59.969 --> 12:01.221
by the time your lunch ended.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.850
I can still see her ride in
circles in the driveway,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.644
calling out,
"Look at me, Daddy."

12:08.686 --> 12:10.313
So now I'm asking you...

12:11.356 --> 12:12.565
look at me.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.530
Blanton,

12:21.950 --> 12:23.785
there are a couple of exarchs

12:23.785 --> 12:25.912
that I would love to
introduce you to

12:25.912 --> 12:27.914
-before you head to
your other parties.
-[clears throat]

12:37.715 --> 12:39.592
-Of course.
-Good.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.551
Yeah.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.568
[all hiss and yell]

12:58.403 --> 12:59.946
[chuckles]

12:59.946 --> 13:01.823
That's storm and fury.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.284
It felt more like
a baby's cough.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.286

13:18.256 --> 13:19.674
Go to bed!

13:26.472 --> 13:27.974
[Abigail sighs]

13:28.933 --> 13:32.186
Whatever that work was,
it hit me hard.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.565
-Same.
-I could barely get out of bed.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.902
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.614
Everybody okay?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.909
Y'all have been busy.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.828
Even made the front page
of The Trib.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.413
[breathes heavily]

13:50.913 --> 13:51.956
What?!

13:53.750 --> 13:55.585
President Wade was assassinated?

13:55.585 --> 13:58.087
Killed by something
called the Witchbomb.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.882
Raelle Collar, is it?

14:00.882 --> 14:02.967
Anybody care to tell me
where she is?

14:02.967 --> 14:06.262
Raelle is not
in the United States.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.847
[Nicte] Maybe it was her.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.684
You've been looking for a
sign she's alive, you get one.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.810
You don't believe it?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.437
She wouldn't assassinate
President Wade.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.938
[Abigail] Yeah.
And besides, they're saying

14:15.938 --> 14:17.023
Tally and I were there,
too,

14:17.023 --> 14:18.649
and you know that we weren't.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.902
Yeah, right. Y'all too busy
running around

14:20.902 --> 14:23.154
the Cession blowing up
chemical plants.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.822
Here's the thing...

14:25.490 --> 14:28.326
the Council of the Great River
is interested in meeting you.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.119
That's why I brought you here.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.913
Great. Where are they?

14:31.913 --> 14:33.748
They'll be here after Yule,

14:33.748 --> 14:36.709
after we all eat, drink,
and be merry together.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.127
The goat.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.838
I completely forgot
Yule was coming.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.132
[The Marshal]
As a gesture of trust,

14:43.132 --> 14:44.842
I'll move the wardings
to the outward grounds.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.554
Let you roam around,
get some fresh air.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.597
Why would you do that?

14:49.931 --> 14:52.016
'Cause I'm a generous man
during the holidays.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.896
Also, I'm gonna need some help
moving that Yule log in.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.816
That thing
gets heavier every year.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.736
Need a refill.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.658
-I don't trust him.
-We don't have a choice.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.827
He's the only one who can tell
the Council we're innocent.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.995
The Council may be more
concerned with the fact

15:12.995 --> 15:14.622
that we're on
their land illegally.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.916
They should be concerned that
the Camarilla are here.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.626
You spent more time in the
Cession than the two of us.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.794
What do you think?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.255
From what I remember
and from what Raelle's told me,

15:22.255 --> 15:23.965
the Council is known to be fair.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.842
So we just need to
make them believe us,

15:26.300 --> 15:27.927
make them our allies.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.179
[laughs] Good luck with that.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.681
You have a better idea?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.307
Maybe.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.064
[Abigail] Once a terrorist,
always a terrorist.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.112
[grunting]

15:53.035 --> 15:55.329
Well, that was
an embarrassing intro.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.916
Sounds like you haven't found
your voice yet, Albie.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.128
Or maybe you're just going
through puberty again?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.964
It's merely work in progress,
which I'll harness soon enough.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.049
Hmm, let's hope so.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.053
It would be a shame if
you mutilated yourself

16:11.053 --> 16:13.931
just to be embarrassed by
a bunch of... [chuckles]

16:13.931 --> 16:16.225
little girls again.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.768
That won't happen.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.396
Oh, such confidence.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.192
Hmm.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.237
Mom and Dad would be proud.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.241
Actually, I take that back.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.620
Mom and Dad would
probably be horrified,

16:35.620 --> 16:38.122
just like they were with all
your other little experiments.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.291
Hmm.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.500
Whatever did happen to all

16:41.500 --> 16:42.919
the dogs in our neighborhood?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.673
Anyway, the company...

16:48.799 --> 16:51.177
is starting to think that
your time with us

16:51.177 --> 16:52.386
is coming to an end,

16:52.386 --> 16:54.639
wasting money on
your pet projects.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.600
I'm sure you'll
prove them wrong,

16:58.601 --> 16:59.685
won't you?

17:02.271 --> 17:05.066
[classical string music]

17:09.987 --> 17:13.074
[vocalizing]

17:24.710 --> 17:26.671
[vocalizing continues]

17:30.091 --> 17:32.510
[gasps]

17:33.219 --> 17:34.845
What the...

17:34.845 --> 17:36.013
[Adler] Bigger storm.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.648
I'm ready.
I'll go say goodbye to Adil.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.123
Thank you for keeping this.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.749
Where are you taking Khalida?

18:03.749 --> 18:05.334
She'll be safe with
the other stewards,

18:05.334 --> 18:07.169
once I find them all.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.422
Look, I know you have this
mission, but stay here.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.173
I mean, meet the Council
and you can

18:11.173 --> 18:12.925
help explain everything to them.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.093
I can't do that.

18:17.138 --> 18:21.475
At least tell me how the Song
heals the world and will--

18:21.475 --> 18:23.936
will it heal Raelle, too?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.855
I'm sorry, Tally Craven.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.441
I don't know.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.110
That's the first time
you said my name.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.407
Tell me something. Please.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.087
We must trust the Mother.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.428
[sighs]

19:13.694 --> 19:15.988
You don't seem
surprised to see me.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.201
Oh, I knew that the esteemed
General Alder would never go off

19:20.201 --> 19:22.286
and do something as
pedestrian as dying.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.537
[Alder scoffs]

19:26.040 --> 19:28.834
I'm sorry to hear about
your Biddies, though.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.837
They all made great sacrifices

19:33.089 --> 19:35.299
and I appreciate that you
shared that working with me

19:35.299 --> 19:37.051
almost 400 years ago.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.178
Well, great work
runs its course.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.723
Like great witches.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.894
Which is just a word
they call us.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.397
[chuckles]

19:51.357 --> 19:53.359
I assume you're here
for the little one?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.032
And this.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.244
Oh, Elayne.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.871
A song was stolen from
one of your people.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.416
Well, plenty of things have
been stolen from my people.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.001
This is of an
even older lineage,

20:11.001 --> 20:13.587
and I need to find
its rightful steward.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.172
Their life is in danger.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.966
Will you help me?

20:23.305 --> 20:26.851
[vocalizing]

20:29.270 --> 20:30.896
Do you know whose song this is?

20:35.526 --> 20:38.362
We just searched half the
Cession trying to find you.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.864
And now you're
leaving with Alder?

20:39.864 --> 20:42.283
I don't expect you
to understand,

20:42.283 --> 20:45.244
but I do expect you
to honor my decision.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.749
I always honor your decisions.

20:50.291 --> 20:54.295
But we're family,
us and Abigail.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.215
And my leaving
doesn't change that.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.509
Please trust that
I know what's best.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.096
We will see each other again.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.401
If you need me
or you're in danger...

21:19.737 --> 21:20.988
use this.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.552
[blows]

21:45.054 --> 21:47.973
I don't think we should tell
Nicte that Alder was here.

21:48.766 --> 21:49.975
Agree.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.310
-Tal?
-Hmm?

21:51.894 --> 21:54.230
-Did you hear me?
-Yeah, fine.
We won't tell her.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.274
Are you okay?

21:57.274 --> 21:59.235
My Sight needs to get better.

21:59.235 --> 22:02.530
I need to see further, see more.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.073
If I can see Rae, then...

22:08.244 --> 22:09.703
[breathes shakily] Mom.

22:12.706 --> 22:16.544
Oh, thank Goddess you're okay.
[sighs]

22:19.004 --> 22:22.007
-President Wade was
assassinated.
-I'm aware.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.592
Silver's in charge?
What is going on?

22:23.592 --> 22:25.177
What--how could this happen?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.179
We need to do something.
We need to fight back.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.723
Oh, that's exactly what
I plan to do.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.609
Thank you.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.528
Glad to refresh as needed.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.364
Oh, we knew the president
was in danger,

22:45.364 --> 22:46.824
so Izadora created a golem

22:46.824 --> 22:49.577
and we allowed the
assassination to take place.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.537
And thanks to
M's strategic timing

22:51.537 --> 22:54.456
and excellent work
under pressure,

22:54.456 --> 22:58.252
they were able to sub the golem
for me before the explosion.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.336
Just doing my job, ma'am.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.796
Hmm.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.383
Wait, where's Raelle?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.302
-Dead.
-She's not dead!

23:06.302 --> 23:08.137
She's healing.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.305
In the Mycelium.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.472
Probably dead.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.641
Excuse me, but who are you?

23:13.350 --> 23:17.563
Hi. I'm Louise.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.607
I'm the chef in this joint.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.691
[Petra] How convenient.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.193
Perhaps you should get back
to the kitchen, Louise.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.653
I hear a timer going off.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.614
General Bellweather.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.622
The plan for all of you is to
stay here with President Wade,

23:34.622 --> 23:37.041
under the protection of
The Marshal and M,

23:37.041 --> 23:38.667
and meet with the Council
when they arrive.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.336
We'll need their support
for what's ahead.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.838
Hopefully soon,
all of you can come back.

23:42.838 --> 23:47.134
Speaking of people coming back,
we--we have to tell her.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.677
Tell me what?

23:50.512 --> 23:53.390
Alder. She's back.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.561
Oh. [clears throat]
I will have that refill now.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.897
What do you mean back?
Where?

23:59.897 --> 24:02.650
She's off with Khalida
looking for the First Song.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.901
An all-powerful song that will

24:03.901 --> 24:05.361
change the world as we know it.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.654
The takeaway here is that

24:06.654 --> 24:07.947
she doesn't want
her old job back.

24:09.657 --> 24:12.576
Okay. Well, speaking of jobs,

24:12.576 --> 24:14.119
I have to get back
to Fort Salem.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.413
Wait, you aren't
staying for Yule?

24:16.830 --> 24:19.583
I wish I could, but I've been
gone too long already.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.339
Everything's going to be okay.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.257
Let President Wade
do the talking with the Council.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.564
[sighs]

24:47.695 --> 24:49.071
It's perfect timing.
I need a sous.

24:49.071 --> 24:52.199
If I ever hear you say that
Raelle's dead again,

24:52.199 --> 24:54.034
you'll be the one
to end up in a grave.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.663
Hm. I like when you're angry.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.622
You're stronger.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.375
This isn't anger, Nicte.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.626
This is love.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.878
And you're too lonely
and miserable

25:04.878 --> 25:06.380
to even tell the difference.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.303
[scoffs]

25:21.437 --> 25:24.898
[grunting]

25:30.195 --> 25:33.407
-[pants]
-Noodin! You're alive.

25:33.407 --> 25:34.950
How do you know my name?

25:34.950 --> 25:36.285
The Marshal told me
where to find you.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.079
[breathes heavily]

25:39.079 --> 25:41.165
I thought maybe I was too late,

25:42.249 --> 25:44.543
but it appears you've
handled things on your own.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.003
You know these people?

25:46.003 --> 25:48.047
Why are they trying to kill me?

25:50.424 --> 25:52.676
Because you're a steward
of the First Song.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.969
What are you talking about?

25:55.262 --> 25:57.848
Your family's song was stolen
from you many years ago,

25:57.848 --> 25:59.308
when you were only a child.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.269
I've come to return it.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.897
Please, listen.

26:10.527 --> 26:13.447
[vocalizing]

26:14.573 --> 26:17.576
[gasps] I know this song.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.789
It's been so long.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.457
It's yours.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.585
And the time will come soon
for you to sing it once more.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.003
[gasps]

26:29.755 --> 26:31.632
They tried to cut out my throat.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.258
That's why I'm here.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.427
I'll take you somewhere safe.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.180
Otherwise, they will come back
until they succeed.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.396
[sighs]

26:49.525 --> 26:50.609
There's no time to waste.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.164
[blows]

27:05.082 --> 27:07.459
I had a feeling
you could whittle.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.962
Hmm. I'm a quick learner.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.008
Hmm. There.

27:34.236 --> 27:38.198
That's your sigil.
Do you see anything?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.371
What's he supposed to see?

27:45.747 --> 27:47.583
It's a game we played as kids,

27:48.333 --> 27:52.045
trying to see "visions" of our
futures in the Smoke-Veil.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.840
My mom used to laugh when

27:54.840 --> 27:56.675
I always said
I saw new sneakers.

27:56.675 --> 27:57.843
[chuckles]

28:02.431 --> 28:03.348
Forget visions.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.519
I'm gonna need everybody's help.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.855
I don't know if it'll work,
but it's worth a try.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.690
It's for Raelle.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.028
On this,
the longest night of Winter,

28:16.028 --> 28:18.572
we offer up
a heartbeat to Earth,

28:18.572 --> 28:20.741
to bring forth new life.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.578
May darkness bring light.
May cold bring warmth.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.580
May death bring life.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.375
[vocalizing]

28:44.973 --> 28:48.268
[vocalizing continues]

29:03.033 --> 29:05.035
Is something supposed to happen?

29:05.035 --> 29:07.162
The Yule Song is powerful,

29:07.162 --> 29:09.748
but I've never seen it
used like this before.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.274
It's cold.
Let's go back to the fire.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.027
I just need a minute alone.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.036
Please.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.706
Show me that you're out there.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.342
[Raelle] Scylla...

30:13.895 --> 30:15.939
[all] Happy Yule!

30:17.983 --> 30:19.901
I'm happy for them.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.071
Wish I could contact my family.

30:24.281 --> 30:27.826
I've got four beautiful
grandchildren that I adore.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.954
This is gonna be their
first Christmas without me.

30:32.122 --> 30:35.000
Just gonna have to buy 'em
double the presents next year.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.710
[chuckles]

30:39.463 --> 30:41.590
I bet you're
pretty handy with that.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.843
I'd be happy to show you later.
