00:07.632 --> 00:11.302
(pensive instrumental music)

00:27.527 --> 00:30.280
(brooding music)

00:36.327 --> 00:39.330
(suspenseful music)

01:00.268 --> 01:02.187
- You okay, Mrs. Crane?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.607
- Yes.
- Can I get you anything?

01:05.607 --> 01:06.900
- No.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.903
(suspenseful music)

01:23.500 --> 01:27.295
(tire spokes clicking)

01:27.295 --> 01:32.300
(zombie snarling)
(suspenseful music)

01:46.106 --> 01:47.357
- Would you like to take a break?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.234
Maybe relax a bit?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.611
Sometimes, I lock myself in the bathroom

01:51.611 --> 01:53.321
and I take a nice long, hot shower.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.739
That usually does it for me.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.617
Did you need a few more minutes?

01:57.617 --> 01:58.451
- [Marion] Yes.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.622
- Would you like to go back upstairs?

02:02.622 --> 02:03.414
- No.

02:04.749 --> 02:05.625
Yes.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.795
He was a good man.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.463
You need to understand this?

02:12.340 --> 02:13.341
- It's okay, Marion.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.845
- Don't patronize me!

02:16.845 --> 02:18.638
He was a good man.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.891
It was his business that had the issue.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.104
(pensive music)

02:32.152 --> 02:34.112
(door creaking)

02:34.112 --> 02:36.781
(pensive music)

02:39.075 --> 02:40.410
(door creaking)

02:40.410 --> 02:43.079
(pensive music)

02:45.665 --> 02:47.250
- [Man] I am sorry.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.422
- Is there something else
you want to confess, my son?

02:54.299 --> 02:55.508
- [Sick Man] I am sorry.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.386
- What do you want to say to me?

03:01.556 --> 03:04.100
- [Man] I can't do it, it's a burden.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.145
- Do you want me to clear the
room so you can speak freely?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.981
(man grunting)

03:09.981 --> 03:13.318
(man faintly murmuring)

03:17.113 --> 03:20.116
(suspenseful music)

03:21.993 --> 03:24.913
(man faintly murmuring)

03:24.913 --> 03:27.582
(suspenseful music)

03:27.582 --> 03:29.876
- I said no video.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.127
That was you.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.462
- You said 57.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.715
What is 57, is that an address?

03:35.715 --> 03:39.719
(man murmuring)
(suspenseful music)

03:39.719 --> 03:41.471
- [Sick Man] I thought I blocked it out.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.434
I remember,

03:48.019 --> 03:50.146
everything that happened.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.483
- Do you mean 1957?

03:53.483 --> 03:56.486
- [Man] Yes, that's it, 57.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.447
(suspenseful music)

03:59.447 --> 04:01.532
- Go head, and confess, my son.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.367
Speak freely.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.911
God is here listening to you.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.164
(suspenseful music)

04:08.164 --> 04:10.750
(man grunting)

04:12.001 --> 04:14.462
He is here to guide you.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.048
He will guide you through your pain.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.758
Confess to God.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.635
He will relieve you of your burden.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.221
- [Sick Man] Seven, 57.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.557
(curious ambient music)

04:59.215 --> 05:00.591
- [Beatrice] Dearest Thomas,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.095
I hope you understand why I've chosen

05:04.095 --> 05:06.014
to end my disintegrating life.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.435
I could not watch myself
get any more hideous

05:10.435 --> 05:12.312
and I did not want you to see it, too.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.232
I hope when you're thinking of me,

05:16.232 --> 05:19.319
you see the beautiful
woman that you married.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.362
You have been so wonderful.

05:21.362 --> 05:24.115
And I am grateful for the
life that I had with you.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.826
(curious ambient music)

05:26.826 --> 05:29.662
I hope you were happy for
me because as you read this,

05:29.662 --> 05:31.247
I'm no longer suffering.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.043
I love you.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.420
And one day, I will see you again.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.757
(curious ambient music)

06:45.696 --> 06:47.490
(book slams)

06:47.490 --> 06:50.827
(curious ambient music)

07:06.259 --> 07:09.262
(tape, plastic crumpling)

07:09.262 --> 07:13.349
(curious ambient music)

07:13.349 --> 07:14.976
(vomit spewing)

07:14.976 --> 07:16.727
(curious ambient music)

07:16.727 --> 07:19.397
(woman gagging)

07:21.691 --> 07:25.069
(curious ambient music)

07:29.282 --> 07:31.951
(intense music)

09:16.055 --> 09:18.808
(dramatic music)

09:36.492 --> 09:37.660
(chain clinks)

09:37.660 --> 09:40.413
(woman coughing)

09:42.206 --> 09:43.249
(woman spitting)

09:43.249 --> 09:46.002
(woman coughing)

09:54.927 --> 09:57.847
(lighter flickers)

10:02.935 --> 10:05.563
- Harold, where have you been?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.898
You disappeared on me.

10:07.898 --> 10:12.278
I thought you died. (laughing)

10:12.278 --> 10:14.989
(woman coughing)

10:17.992 --> 10:20.036
(sighs) I think I need to call Dr. Valmer,

10:20.036 --> 10:20.953
who's in tomorrow.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.664
Whatever bug you've been building up,

10:23.664 --> 10:25.249
I think I caught.

10:29.545 --> 10:33.924
(coughing) Harold, have you
even heard a single word I said?

10:34.759 --> 10:37.762
(scoffs) It's no wonder
you can keep a goddamn job.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.640
You're lucky you can pay the
$90 for this month's rent.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.183
Probably gonna have to ask father again,

10:42.183 --> 10:43.476
to help bail us out.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.358
(pensive music)
You okay?

10:50.358 --> 10:52.360
You've been weird ever since Bogart died.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.446
I think I'm going to make tea.
(zombie growling)

10:55.446 --> 10:59.575
(coughing) Maybe I'll heat
up some corn beef hash, too.

10:59.575 --> 11:04.580
(woman screaming)
(intense music)

11:09.669 --> 11:11.879
(zombie growling)

11:11.879 --> 11:16.884
(woman screaming)
(intense piano music)

11:20.763 --> 11:23.182
(faint murmuring)

11:23.182 --> 11:24.183
I understand.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.060
(faint murmuring)

11:26.060 --> 11:26.977
Uh ha, bye.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.634
(typewriter key clicking)

11:58.634 --> 12:00.553
(phone rings)

12:00.553 --> 12:03.222
(Bethany sighs)

12:05.766 --> 12:10.521
(phone rings)
(typewriter keys clicking)

12:10.521 --> 12:11.939
Where have you been, mister?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.358
That darn phone has been ringing non-stop.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.153
- I'm only two minutes late.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.947
(Bethany scoffs)

12:21.282 --> 12:22.116
- Hello?

12:24.660 --> 12:28.247
(typewriter keys clicking)

12:28.247 --> 12:29.039
So...

12:30.082 --> 12:31.250
Why do you think

12:31.250 --> 12:33.878
that I wouldn't be able
to write our wedding vows?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.671
- Where is this coming from?

12:35.671 --> 12:36.672
- Well, I'm in the car,

12:36.672 --> 12:38.841
listening to the Jimmy Star
Show, on the way over here.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.135
So they start discussing wedding vows.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.680
So I clearly thought back

12:44.680 --> 12:46.474
to the other night's
dinner conversation where-

12:46.474 --> 12:49.143
(laughing) The dinner
that you were late for?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.020
Mister, I'm always on time.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.105
I'm always punctual.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.566
Mister, I'm always late
when that phone is ringing.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.735
(typewriter keys clicking)

12:57.735 --> 12:59.320
- You know what else I'm gonna be late to?

13:00.529 --> 13:01.489
Our wedding.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.325
(Bethany scoffs)

13:04.325 --> 13:06.160
- Not likely.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.453
Unless you want to be carried to the alter

13:07.453 --> 13:08.913
by two big gorillas.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.997
And Bobby will make sure that James

13:09.997 --> 13:12.541
and Charles are right there
by your side on that day.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.085
- So the gorillas are your two brothers?

13:15.085 --> 13:18.297
I'm sorry, I thought you
were referring to your folks.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.341
- Why, George Alfred Lazarus,

13:20.341 --> 13:22.301
you take that back!

13:22.301 --> 13:23.427
You take it back!

13:24.303 --> 13:26.347
(Bethany scoffs)

13:26.347 --> 13:29.642
(typewriter keys clicking)

13:29.642 --> 13:31.227
(phone rings)

13:31.227 --> 13:32.561
Pick up that-
- Insurance.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.231
Yeah, this is he.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.651
- [Bethany] Mother and
father are not going to-

13:38.651 --> 13:40.069
(George scoffs)

13:40.069 --> 13:41.445
- You don't say?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.657
No, I don't see anything here.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.325
- Your sister's a baboon.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.036
- Hmm hmm.
(Bethany playful grunting)

13:49.036 --> 13:51.455
Hold, Bethany, you got
a telegram this morning?

13:51.455 --> 13:52.248
- [Bethany] No.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.166
- Wait, Mr. George, wait.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.209
- [George] Hold on a second, here.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.669
- Good morning, Benjamin! (laughing)

13:56.669 --> 13:59.964
- [George] I'll call you back
(murmurs), give me a second.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.632
Yeah, got it, uh ha.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.051
- [Chip] Good morning, Ms. Bethany.

14:04.051 --> 14:07.847
- And how are you today?
- Eh. (laughing)

14:11.642 --> 14:13.227
- Ah, look at this.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.563
Okay.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.608
Oh, I hope that's not your
mother's blueberry pie

14:19.608 --> 14:23.070
that you got tucked in under
your arm there. (laughing)

14:23.070 --> 14:26.782
- Oh no, I picked this
up at the five and dime.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.367
It's a Frisbee.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.827
You play catch with it.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.953
Kind of like baseball,

14:30.953 --> 14:34.248
but it's with the saucer, instead.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.208
- Well, why don't you
just find a baseball?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.794
- I kind of wanted to
see how I like this first

14:38.794 --> 14:41.171
so I can send it to my
little cousin for Christmas.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.256
- Oh dear.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.799
Do you really think he's
going to enjoy playing

14:43.799 --> 14:45.092
with a pie pan?

14:46.969 --> 14:49.555
- Well, I don't know,
I hope so. (laughing)

14:49.555 --> 14:51.640
I spent all my money on a plane ticket

14:51.640 --> 14:52.683
to see the little brat,

14:52.683 --> 14:54.518
and my namesake, my Uncle Ben.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.021
I know, no rice jokes.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.398
(Bethany laughing)

14:59.398 --> 15:03.611
(George faintly talking)

15:03.611 --> 15:05.154
- I'm sure he's going to love it.

15:05.154 --> 15:05.988
- Okay, thanks.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.157
Hey, good morning, Chip.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.994
All right, so that was Hitchcock

15:11.994 --> 15:14.413
over at Topaz Insurance.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.831
A company over in Studio City

15:15.831 --> 15:18.542
just filed a claim against
some of their employees,

15:18.542 --> 15:21.837
stating that they had
sabotaged his business

15:21.837 --> 15:23.547
with some unknown source.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.258
So the owner, he wants his claim adjusted

15:26.258 --> 15:27.468
and he wants the policy pay out

15:27.468 --> 15:29.219
so it can make up for the downtime.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.848
- Well, that claim sounds like
it's both birds, Mr. George.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.268
- Hmm, yeah, well, Topaz agrees.

15:36.268 --> 15:40.856
So, they want us to dig,
see what we find out.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.691
- Well, how much is the claim for?

15:42.691 --> 15:46.320
- Well, looking at 13 people on the claim

15:46.320 --> 15:47.947
from the company,

15:47.947 --> 15:49.782
lost wages,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.367
estimated,

15:51.367 --> 15:52.618
$13 million.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.036
(Chip spits milk)

15:54.036 --> 15:55.663
(Bethany gasps)

15:55.663 --> 15:56.580
- I declare.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.457
- Well, what company
has that type of money

15:58.457 --> 16:00.459
to pay out, anyway?

16:00.459 --> 16:02.503
I don't know, it seems a little out there,

16:02.503 --> 16:04.630
like that woman who stole $40,000

16:04.630 --> 16:06.382
to pay for her boyfriend's divorce.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.927
And then she gets caught
and wants to return it.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.261
(Chip and Bethany laughing)

16:11.261 --> 16:12.638
I tell ya, people.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.474
Geez, what a psycho.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.601
- Why don't you tell us
how you really feel, Chip?

16:22.648 --> 16:26.485
- Goodbye, Ms. Bethany.
- Goodbye. (laughing)

16:26.485 --> 16:28.362
- Bye, George.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.949
(typewriter keys clicking)

16:34.076 --> 16:35.995
- Don't forget, we have
dinner tonight at the Parks.

16:35.995 --> 16:36.829
And then afterwards,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.498
all watching you bet
your life on television.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.417
- (scoffs) That was tonight, wasn't it?

16:42.251 --> 16:45.254
- No George, you did
this to them last week.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.922
We are going and that is final.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.090
- Uh ha.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.342
- George, you promised.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.218
- Hmm hmm, yeah.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.429
- George stop, you promised!

16:53.429 --> 16:54.930
- Oh, all right, all right!

16:56.432 --> 16:57.266
Until then though,

16:57.266 --> 16:58.100
I'm going down to the Valley.

16:58.100 --> 16:58.934
I've got to take a ride out there.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.644
I've got to sit down with Harry.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.271
I gotta get more details.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.356
- Well, you need company?

17:04.356 --> 17:05.357
I'm almost done here.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.775
- Nah, that's okay, love.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.235
I'll be back within the hour.

17:09.862 --> 17:10.821
- Okay, Mister.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.115
You don't want me around?

17:14.533 --> 17:15.534
I get it.

17:15.534 --> 17:19.580
(typewriter keys clicking)
- Hey.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.458
You know, you...

17:23.834 --> 17:25.961
You're my special flower.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.548
I wouldn't know what to do
if you weren't in my life.

17:30.966 --> 17:31.967
You keep me honest.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.554
You keep me grounded.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.974
And you keep me humble.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.977
And these are some of the things

17:41.977 --> 17:43.437
that I truly love about you.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.982
(lips smacks)

17:46.982 --> 17:47.775
You see?

17:49.276 --> 17:50.986
I could write my vows.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.447
- (laughing) Take me with you.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.490
- I certainly will.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.742
And this...

18:01.747 --> 18:04.291
This is what you got me
for my birthday last year.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.755
Man, I'm killing this vow stuff!

18:09.755 --> 18:13.008
- Oh, what am I gonna do with you?

18:13.008 --> 18:14.093
(muffled DJ on radio)

18:14.093 --> 18:15.469
- [DJ On Radio] Stated
that Jackie Robinson

18:15.469 --> 18:17.137
will not be moving with
the Brooklyn Dodgers

18:17.137 --> 18:18.722
when they relocate to Los Angeles...

18:18.722 --> 18:23.727
(upbeat music)
(faint chattering)

18:26.021 --> 18:27.606
- [George] Hey Smitty, what do you say?

18:27.606 --> 18:28.732
- Hey, George, the usual?

18:28.732 --> 18:29.817
- Yes, with a Tribune.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.444
You like the fights, George.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.529
- Hasn't been exciting to me

18:33.529 --> 18:35.906
since my Marciano retired last year.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.909
(upbeat music)
(overlapping chattering)

18:38.909 --> 18:42.162
- Big talker today, I see. (laughs)

18:42.162 --> 18:43.539
Okay, one A cream.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.543
Ed Gein, is that that killer's name?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.130
I've heard about him.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.882
Good, they caught him.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.051
Have you been following
that story, George?

18:57.845 --> 18:59.888
Pretty interesting stuff.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.431
Hey, it could make a good book, one day.

19:01.431 --> 19:05.394
(upbeat music)
(overlapping chattering)

19:05.394 --> 19:06.520
Oh, what's the use?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.272
That'll be the usual, 25 cents.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.775
- I was hoping you'd throw me
a curve on your price, Smitty.

19:11.775 --> 19:12.943
- Curve balls?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.403
Hey, in April, you can
see as many as you like

19:14.403 --> 19:15.988
when the Dodgers play.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.408
- Says here, Robinson is
thinking of retiring this year.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.285
- You don't say, really?

19:21.285 --> 19:22.703
What a bum.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.371
Let New York keep 'em.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.666
I hear they're still pretty
upset that they're moving here.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.835
Maybe we'll take their
beloved Yankees, too,

19:29.835 --> 19:31.670
and have all three of
their teams, right George?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.380
- It would never happen.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.216
- Jumping Joe is always
out here anyways, George.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.676
You know what I mean?

19:37.676 --> 19:42.181
Jumping Joe, he's always
out here anyways. (laughing)

19:42.181 --> 19:43.223
Get it?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.559
Jumping Joe, he's always out here.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.393
He's always here, anyways.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.103
- See you tomorrow, Smitty.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.688
- [Smitty] He's always here.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.398
- I don't get it, Smitty.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.567
- Just drink your shake, Bub.

19:53.567 --> 19:58.322
(upbeat music)
(overlapping chattering)

19:58.322 --> 20:01.116
(birds chirping)

20:09.416 --> 20:10.876
(fire crackling)

20:10.876 --> 20:15.881
(bells tolling)
(suspenseful music)

20:16.215 --> 20:18.842
(Steven moans)

20:19.718 --> 20:22.721
(suspenseful music)

20:32.981 --> 20:35.859
(phone trills)

20:35.859 --> 20:38.987
- Operator?
- Yes, operator.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.198
Please, fetch me the police.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.158
- [Operator] Is this an emergency, sir?

20:43.158 --> 20:47.162
- Yes, thank you.
- Please hold.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.497
- [Police] Los Angeles Police Department.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.498
Sergeant Jone's speaking.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.166
Who am I speaking with, please?

20:51.166 --> 20:52.167
(suspenseful music)

20:52.167 --> 20:54.628
- This is Steven Wells.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.380
- [Police] What's your
emergency, Mr. Wells?

20:56.380 --> 20:59.758
- Sir, I would like to record a murder.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.593
- [Police] A murder, did
you say a murder, Mr. Wells?

21:01.593 --> 21:04.596
(suspenseful music)

21:04.596 --> 21:09.184
- I think I killed my
wife. (labored breathing)

21:09.184 --> 21:10.352
Again.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.104
- [Police] Sir, what
exactly, what are you saying?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.482
(suspenseful music)

21:15.482 --> 21:19.069
- 8585 Sunset Boulevard.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.406
The door's gonna be open.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.491
We'll be waiting here.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.284
Please.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.787
Steven Wells.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.832
W-E-L-L-S.

21:32.958 --> 21:33.792
Thank you.

21:35.127 --> 21:40.132
(phone slams)
(suspenseful music)

21:44.511 --> 21:46.930
(Steven sighs)

21:46.930 --> 21:49.933
(suspenseful music)

21:58.942 --> 22:01.528
(ominous music)

22:10.829 --> 22:12.831
(water lightly rippling)

22:12.831 --> 22:15.542
(ominous music)

22:19.046 --> 22:21.715
(water lightly rippling)

22:21.715 --> 22:24.384
(ominous music)

22:26.678 --> 22:29.890
(light snarling)

22:29.890 --> 22:32.559
(ominous music)

22:33.435 --> 22:37.481
(light snarling)
(dramatic music)

22:37.481 --> 22:40.192
(ominous music)

22:44.905 --> 22:47.574
(pensive music)

22:54.331 --> 22:57.084
(dramatic music)

22:58.418 --> 23:01.463
(zombie lightly snarling)

23:01.463 --> 23:04.299
(dramatic music)

23:20.607 --> 23:25.612
(zombie screaming)
(Steven yelling)

23:48.093 --> 23:50.178
- [Assistant] Ms. Daniels
will see you now, Mr. Lazarus.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.346
- Okay, thank you.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.945
- Seems very messy and
strange, Mr. Lazarus.

24:08.196 --> 24:11.241
Their policy was strictly
built for a retirement plan.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.661
Then we started to offer
this, and of course,

24:14.661 --> 24:16.121
in the nature of our business,

24:16.121 --> 24:18.874
placed it under the banner of term life,

24:18.874 --> 24:21.501
which indicates that we
must pay out a lump sum

24:21.501 --> 24:24.129
for any terminal or
critical illness, as well,

24:24.129 --> 24:28.091
if the claim has proven to be
true without any fraud intact.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.387
This will completely bankrupt us,

24:32.387 --> 24:35.474
and our three affiliates,
if this policy is valid.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.435
- Look, I had a chance to
read through the documents

24:38.435 --> 24:40.770
while I was waiting to
meet your husband, Harry.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.399
- Pardon, he and Hitchcock's
quick in and out entry.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.692
Due to this policy,

24:45.692 --> 24:46.818
he was needed for a discussion

24:46.818 --> 24:48.987
with our shareholders in Fresno,

24:48.987 --> 24:52.407
but that's part of the trouble with Harry.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.742
- Excuse me, Ms. Daniels?

24:55.702 --> 24:58.997
Nothing jumps out at me for
this to be considered fraud.

25:00.123 --> 25:03.710
- Fraud occurs when any act is committed

25:03.710 --> 25:07.422
with the intent to falsely
obtain some benefit

25:07.422 --> 25:11.593
or advantage to which
someone is not entitled.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.179
- Well, I know what the
definition to fraud means.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.181
This claim,

25:17.807 --> 25:18.725
seems legit.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.856
- This policy is for 13 people

25:24.856 --> 25:28.818
who worked over at the Deadly
Sin Cigarettes Company.

25:28.818 --> 25:32.197
The company on paper is
owned by two brothers.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.574
- Yes, Enoch and Eliza Schindler.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.493
- Who now sit on the sidelines

25:36.493 --> 25:38.745
and witness what is
happening to their world.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.207
- [George] What do you mean, on paper?

25:42.207 --> 25:44.834
- They don't exist, Mr. Lazarus!

25:44.834 --> 25:46.044
They disappeared!

25:50.507 --> 25:53.093
My husband, Harry, received
a telegram early last year

25:53.093 --> 25:54.469
on our wedding anniversary,

25:55.387 --> 25:56.930
April the 22nd.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.475
I found it odd that we received a telegram

26:00.475 --> 26:02.310
early on a Sunday morning from an,

26:03.353 --> 26:07.399
Mr. L. B. Jefferies,

26:07.399 --> 26:10.193
stating that the company, Deadly Sin,

26:10.193 --> 26:11.903
now has a new owner and president

26:11.903 --> 26:14.239
who will oversee all operations.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.284
The company, at the time, had some issues.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.327
So they needed someone
with good business sense

26:19.327 --> 26:20.912
to come in and keep it running.

26:23.790 --> 26:27.377
But the wrong man sits at
the helm of Deadly Sin,

26:27.377 --> 26:28.628
causing, now this.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.923
My company to act in frenzy.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.635
You need to clear this up.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.221
You need to catch a thief.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.682
You need to pull the curtain back.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.311
- No, no, thank you, I don't smoke.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.564
Look as I stated, Ms. Daniels,

26:48.648 --> 26:49.649
I don't see anything odd.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.109
I don't see odd in the claim.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.821
- The names on this claim were all let go

26:54.821 --> 26:56.948
within three days of one another.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.577
They all state the same illness,
causing company hardship.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.706
They also listed them as supervisors

27:04.706 --> 27:07.125
and employee of the month.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.045
The man who now pulls the rope over there

27:10.045 --> 27:13.048
is Mr. Mammon Beelzebub,

27:13.048 --> 27:16.301
a self-reformed ex-gangster from New York.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.346
Now a legit businessman.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.474
A real model citizen.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.976
He and his over-protective
daughter run the place.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.314
- They all state the
same date on the policy,

27:29.314 --> 27:32.275
which is August 13th.

27:32.275 --> 27:35.737
- I have your attention now, Mr. Lazarus?

27:36.905 --> 27:40.867
False insurance claims are
claims filed with the intent

27:40.867 --> 27:43.370
to defraud an insurance provider,

27:43.370 --> 27:45.372
which is me!

27:45.372 --> 27:47.791
Out of $13 million.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.212
Investigate! (hand slams)

27:56.174 --> 27:59.302
(sighs) Please, investigate.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.640
- Will do, Ms. Daniels.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.770
You have a good day.
- Thank you.

28:10.772 --> 28:13.525
(paper crumbles)

28:14.984 --> 28:17.654
(match strikes)

28:35.547 --> 28:38.675
(Ms. Daniels exhales)

28:49.352 --> 28:51.396
(machine whirring)

28:51.396 --> 28:53.648
(man coughing)

28:53.648 --> 28:56.067
- Donovan said he saw one that was huge,

28:56.067 --> 28:58.737
said it's the size of a small cat!

28:58.737 --> 29:00.655
(laughing) Do they even come that big?

29:05.660 --> 29:06.828
You look like hell.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.706
You still got the flu?

29:09.706 --> 29:12.667
(machine whirring)

29:13.793 --> 29:15.378
(laughing) How's your arm healing up

29:15.378 --> 29:17.714
from Roger's dog bite last week?

29:17.714 --> 29:20.467
(machine whirring)

29:20.467 --> 29:22.677
You lost a lot of blood. (laughing)

29:22.677 --> 29:23.720
How's the arm?

29:24.679 --> 29:26.264
- I haven't really looked at it.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.436
(man coughing)

29:31.436 --> 29:32.437
- You know, I thought that dog was going

29:32.437 --> 29:34.272
to pull your arm right out of the socket.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.691
Never seen anything like that before.

29:36.691 --> 29:39.527
First, he attacks your dog, then you.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.447
You know, oh, this damn machine.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.282
Gotta get maintence down here.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.534
It's like the fifth time,
they fixed this thing.

29:46.534 --> 29:50.205
(man coughing and snarling)

29:53.500 --> 29:54.417
You know, Ronnie had to put 'em down

29:54.417 --> 29:55.502
for fear of his kid's life.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.754
- [Man] Good, get rid of that beast.

29:57.754 --> 30:01.174
- Yeah, hell, maybe his
wife, too? (laughing)

30:01.174 --> 30:04.344
(man coughing)

30:04.344 --> 30:06.304
You know, what, what,
what would, what were you,

30:06.304 --> 30:09.766
what possessed you to bring
that little dog of yours

30:09.766 --> 30:11.726
to play poker over there, man?

30:11.726 --> 30:12.644
(man incessantly coughing)

30:12.644 --> 30:14.229
You know he's got that big
son of a bitch running around

30:14.229 --> 30:15.355
that shit hole yard of his.

30:15.355 --> 30:18.608
Damn, this machine!
(man coughing)

30:19.776 --> 30:21.069
Mickey, you all right?

30:21.069 --> 30:22.779
(man coughing)

30:22.779 --> 30:26.449
You know, you provoked
that animal, yep, you did.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.201
You know, you cooked dinner for us.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.662
You got the steak and chicken all over ya.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.121
You make two bowls of food,

30:32.121 --> 30:35.917
one for Diesel and one for your
little ankle biter, Oliver.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.503
(man coughing)

30:43.091 --> 30:44.050
You all right there, Buddy?

30:44.050 --> 30:46.761
Let me get that for ya, let me get this.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.929
Here, come on, drink it up.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.181
It's good, drink it up.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.099
That a boy.

30:52.767 --> 30:53.768
(man vomits)
(man yells)

30:53.768 --> 30:54.769
Oh, come on.

30:55.770 --> 31:00.775
(man yelling)
(machine whirring)

31:13.663 --> 31:17.250
(man incessantly coughing)

31:19.419 --> 31:21.212
(ominous music)

31:21.212 --> 31:24.799
(man incessantly coughing)

31:26.134 --> 31:29.095
(machine whirring)

31:31.639 --> 31:34.142
(eerie music)

31:46.571 --> 31:49.240
(woman screams)

31:52.160 --> 31:55.538
(seductive jazzy music)

32:33.284 --> 32:36.204
(lighter flickers)

32:37.372 --> 32:40.708
(seductive jazzy music)

33:09.612 --> 33:11.030
(belt snaps)

33:11.030 --> 33:13.241
(seductive jazzy music)

33:13.241 --> 33:16.119
(man grunting)
(woman moaning)

33:16.119 --> 33:18.496
(seductive jazzy music)

33:18.496 --> 33:21.499
(plastic crumpling)

33:25.837 --> 33:27.922
- You pissed yourself?

33:29.632 --> 33:32.135
(man gasping)

33:37.932 --> 33:39.559
I hold mine in all day.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.521
(man breathing heavily)

33:43.521 --> 33:45.231
It gives me an edge.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.526
(man breathing heavily)

33:50.987 --> 33:53.322
Tell me again, why you want me to stop?

33:55.074 --> 33:56.284
'Cause if I stop,

33:58.036 --> 34:01.414
I'll fire you.
(belt pelts)

34:01.414 --> 34:02.874
And if I fire you,

34:04.959 --> 34:06.544
who will then support

34:07.962 --> 34:10.757
your high school drop out of a life?

34:11.674 --> 34:14.052
And those four unbalanced kids?

34:18.097 --> 34:19.557
You're such a sap, Tad.

34:21.434 --> 34:24.896
Any woman that has four
kids from four other men

34:24.896 --> 34:26.689
is only after the support.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.194
It's tough being a lady these days.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.911
(hand slaps)

34:44.332 --> 34:45.750
How many times,

34:47.335 --> 34:48.878
has she left you struggling?

34:50.171 --> 34:51.005
Hmm?

34:54.008 --> 34:54.842
How many times?

34:57.136 --> 34:58.012
Three?

34:59.597 --> 35:02.433
Four?
(Tad gasping)

35:05.353 --> 35:06.729
When she goes out in the world

35:06.729 --> 35:10.024
and realizes she can't hold
a job, it's time for 10.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.488
How many years have you
been with this woman?

35:16.948 --> 35:19.742
11?
(Tad gasps)

35:19.742 --> 35:20.618
12?

35:24.038 --> 35:27.625
(Tad grunting and yelling)

35:30.086 --> 35:33.422
When is it enough?
(Tad gasps)

35:39.637 --> 35:42.223
So tell me again, why you want me to stop?

35:42.223 --> 35:45.685
(Tad breathing hard)

35:45.685 --> 35:47.436
You know, you can always leave her

35:47.436 --> 35:48.479
and come play with me!

35:48.479 --> 35:52.441
(belt slaps)
(Tad yelling)

35:52.441 --> 35:55.278
- [Mother] Your father
would like to see you.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.780
- I don't remember hearing you knock out.

35:57.780 --> 35:58.573
Get out!

36:00.783 --> 36:03.161
(door slams)

36:04.120 --> 36:05.454
(Tad gasps)

36:05.454 --> 36:08.791
(Tad breathing heavily)

36:11.711 --> 36:15.131
(belt slaps)
- Ouch.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.507
(woman moaning)

36:16.507 --> 36:21.387
(belt slaps)
(Tad grunts)

36:22.263 --> 36:26.184
- Tell me.
(Tell breathing heavily)

36:29.228 --> 36:31.981
(lighter flickers)

36:31.981 --> 36:35.318
(Tad breathing heavily)

36:38.487 --> 36:40.698
(woman exhales)

36:40.698 --> 36:43.284
(Tad coughing)

36:44.744 --> 36:45.703
- You know?

36:47.330 --> 36:48.456
I admire you.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.837
You still stay and put up
with that woman's crap.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.008
(Tad sobbing)

36:59.008 --> 37:01.552
(woman exhales)

37:01.552 --> 37:05.348
Thinking you can change
her unbalanced ways.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.059
Hmm.

37:10.770 --> 37:15.024
(Tad yells)
(woman laughs)

37:15.024 --> 37:15.858
Hmm.

37:18.069 --> 37:22.031
I told you, a long time ago,

37:24.784 --> 37:25.785
she's a disease.

37:29.038 --> 37:32.959
A disease needs to be cured.
(Tad yelps)

37:34.627 --> 37:36.170
And that's what I am for you.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.799
A cure.

37:40.925 --> 37:41.801
Hmm.

37:41.801 --> 37:42.635
(loud slapping)
(Tad grunts)

37:42.635 --> 37:43.469
Your escape!

37:46.347 --> 37:48.641
Think about how much money you'll save.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.607
I am your only pleasure.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.236
And you know that. (slaps)

38:03.239 --> 38:05.908
(woman moaning)

38:16.502 --> 38:17.336
Pansy!

38:20.506 --> 38:22.341
- What a horrible time, here,

38:23.718 --> 38:28.514
telling Jimmy's wife and
family, were very tough for us.

38:30.808 --> 38:31.642
- Jimmy, Jimmy-

38:31.642 --> 38:33.644
- I shut down production lines,

38:34.562 --> 38:35.938
send everybody home.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.820
It wasn't about profit margin that day.

38:42.820 --> 38:43.821
- [George] You have any idea-

38:43.821 --> 38:45.698
- It was about losing people.

38:46.532 --> 38:49.118
Here at Deadly Sins, we're a family,

38:49.118 --> 38:50.244
a family, I say.

38:51.412 --> 38:54.040
It wasn't about profit.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.541
It was about valuable people.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.460
- You have any idea how much-

38:57.460 --> 39:01.547
- This day and this
tragedy nearly crippled us,

39:03.549 --> 39:04.633
paying for funerals,

39:06.552 --> 39:08.637
paying for family benefits.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.893
- So-
- Scrapping machinery.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.608
Tossing merchandise.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.986
- I'm trying to get
some answers here, sir.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.076
- Next time you come,

39:30.076 --> 39:32.161
you're going to do two things, eh.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.120
(lighter flickers)

39:33.120 --> 39:33.996
- [George] Okay.

39:35.414 --> 39:38.417
(suspenseful music)

39:39.418 --> 39:41.295
(Beelzebub exhales)

39:41.295 --> 39:43.714
- You're going to make a schedule with us

39:45.049 --> 39:45.883
and you're going to come here

39:45.883 --> 39:48.636
and you're going to show
me respect, Mr. Lazarus.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.722
You're not just going to
barge into a man's office

39:51.722 --> 39:55.601
to talk about things
that you already know.

39:55.601 --> 39:59.772
So you tell your company,
next time they send you,

40:00.898 --> 40:05.694
please, schedule it.
(suspenseful music)

40:05.694 --> 40:07.363
- Will do, Mr-
- Thank you.

40:09.031 --> 40:11.075
(phone trilling)

40:11.075 --> 40:13.327
Marjorie, four, two, two, eight.

40:14.453 --> 40:15.788
- You have a good day, sir.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.042
- I say, four, two,
two eight, please, hmm.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.846
Hmm, I don't know what you want me to say

40:32.763 --> 40:34.348
or what you want me to do.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.394
That was two weeks ago.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.980
But yes, we did meet.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.731
- (sighs) Thank God.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.858
Well, I would just like-

40:43.858 --> 40:45.651
- When will they cut us our payment?

40:46.652 --> 40:48.487
- Oh, well that's a different department.

40:48.487 --> 40:49.697
We're here to talk about-

40:49.697 --> 40:51.949
- If you're not here to talk settlement,

40:51.949 --> 40:53.993
what are you doing here wasting our time?

40:55.244 --> 40:57.746
- Well, you see, Mr. Bee-za-bub.

40:57.746 --> 41:00.708
- Beelzebub.
- Beelzebub.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.210
This was one of the last
places that my fiance,

41:03.210 --> 41:04.128
George, visited.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.838
And I would just like to ask you a few-

41:05.838 --> 41:07.798
- My father already told you.

41:07.798 --> 41:10.885
Did you not understand
anything, he just said?

41:10.885 --> 41:13.220
(suspenseful music)

41:13.220 --> 41:14.555
- Sassy, this one!

41:15.764 --> 41:19.393
She wanted to be a star when
we came out to Hollywood.

41:19.393 --> 41:21.395
She wanted to be in pictures.

41:21.395 --> 41:25.107
She wanted her name on the
marque, up in the lights,

41:26.525 --> 41:29.236
until I told her, I said, my darling,

41:29.236 --> 41:33.407
stars are for imbeciles.

41:34.408 --> 41:35.993
You will make more money

41:37.119 --> 41:39.288
and have power,

41:39.288 --> 41:42.249
more money than what those studios

41:42.249 --> 41:46.504
pay those so-called contract players.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.925
She is the future of Deadly Sins.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.557
I've answered

41:59.767 --> 42:01.310
all your questions.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.438
I've answered to Thayers.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.318
I've answered your fiancee.

42:12.738 --> 42:15.366
I've even, now, answered yours,

42:16.951 --> 42:21.330
but nobody seemed to
have answered mine yet.

42:22.957 --> 42:26.669
Who will bring me

42:26.669 --> 42:27.920
my money?

42:29.046 --> 42:33.259
Would it be you, little
girl? (breaths heavily)

42:33.259 --> 42:34.969
Would you bring me my money

42:36.053 --> 42:37.888
or would it be Sambo?

42:37.888 --> 42:42.893
Would you fetch me my money? (laughing)

42:45.271 --> 42:46.855
- I think we're done here.

42:46.855 --> 42:47.898
We're going to head back to the office

42:47.898 --> 42:50.317
and see what the holdup is with processing

42:51.277 --> 42:52.194
and your check.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.658
(suspenseful music)

42:59.910 --> 43:02.121
- Sambo. (laughing)

43:03.497 --> 43:06.292
(woman screaming)

43:09.878 --> 43:13.799
(footsteps pounding)

43:13.799 --> 43:14.800
- If you shut down a production room,

43:14.800 --> 43:15.718
you're shutting it down.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.803
You don't absorb the
people in any other place.

43:17.803 --> 43:19.555
Do you understand, that's the business!

43:19.555 --> 43:20.389
I don't care about-

43:20.389 --> 43:21.640
- But father, they're innocent
people, you can't just-

43:21.640 --> 43:22.891
- It doesn't matter who it is.

43:22.891 --> 43:24.560
It doesn't matter.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.145
They're gone, they're gone, that's period.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.646
Period!

43:27.646 --> 43:28.981
Speak, MacMan.

43:28.981 --> 43:31.525
- You've gotta come to
the production room.

43:31.525 --> 43:32.401
- Why do I got to come to the production,

43:32.401 --> 43:34.945
since when do I go to the
production room, MacMan?

43:34.945 --> 43:36.238
- You've just gotta come
to production room one.

43:36.238 --> 43:37.406
- What is it, Jimmy?

43:37.406 --> 43:38.240
Is it Jimmy, again?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.116
I told you it's Jimmy.

43:39.116 --> 43:41.285
He should've got rid of Jimmy
a long time ago, little girl.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.287
Go see what he wants!

43:43.287 --> 43:44.330
- Yes father, I'll handle it.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.664
- Yeah, you'll handle it.

43:45.664 --> 43:46.540
You'll handle everything.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.458
You want to handle people.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.043
You want to keep people on the payroll.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.712
If we don't need them, we don't need 'em!

43:51.712 --> 43:55.007
(Mammon breathing heavily)

43:55.007 --> 43:57.259
(woman screaming)

43:57.259 --> 44:00.763
Take that screaming woman out of here.

44:00.763 --> 44:05.559
(woman screaming)
- Calm down, calm down.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.271
- Little girl, you don't need to see this.

44:10.564 --> 44:12.149
- [Lucinda] Okay.

44:12.149 --> 44:16.695
- Lucinda, darling, you
don't need to see this.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.282
You don't need to look at this.

44:20.282 --> 44:23.619
(suspenseful music)
(moaning)

44:23.619 --> 44:24.453
MacMan!

44:25.996 --> 44:28.999
(suspenseful music)

44:31.502 --> 44:32.461
Clean this up.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.590
Clean it all up.

44:36.590 --> 44:38.801
MacMan, what do you think
you're doing with that?

44:38.801 --> 44:40.386
- We can throw it out with them.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.429
- (laughing) Throw it out with them, see?

44:44.598 --> 44:46.642
- Tossing it out, tossing it out.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.185
You see what I'm doing here, MacMan?

44:48.185 --> 44:49.228
You see what I'm doing?

44:49.228 --> 44:50.479
I'm tossing my money away.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.231
Why don't you do the same
thing with my investment.

44:52.231 --> 44:53.816
Now, clean that up,

44:53.816 --> 44:57.695
wipe it down and get
all this nice and clean.

44:58.529 --> 45:01.031
- But-
- No butts, MacMan.

45:01.031 --> 45:03.117
- But, it's contaminated.

45:04.326 --> 45:07.913
- (laughing) Contaminated?

45:07.913 --> 45:10.916
(suspenseful music)

45:12.376 --> 45:15.212
This is what you're going to do, MacMan.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.131
You're going to clean up my investment.

45:17.131 --> 45:20.008
You're going to put it
in that machine, you see?

45:20.008 --> 45:22.219
And you're gonna run
production as planned.

45:26.432 --> 45:28.934
And you're gonna take my product

45:28.934 --> 45:31.437
and you're going to put it in a pallet.

45:31.437 --> 45:34.231
You're going to store the
pallet in a warehouse, MacMan.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.944
And you're going to take 13 employees,

45:38.944 --> 45:40.362
whoever you want.

45:40.362 --> 45:41.822
I don't care.

45:41.822 --> 45:45.743
You're going to reward them
as employees of the month.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.494
You'll take their pictures.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.163
You'll hang them up in the lobby.

45:50.372 --> 45:53.792
(scoffs) And then, Mr. MacMan (laughs),

45:54.877 --> 45:57.045
you're going to take my investment.

45:57.045 --> 45:59.298
You're going to ship it out.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.966
And we're gonna wait.

46:02.468 --> 46:05.888
(suspenseful music)

46:05.888 --> 46:07.973
Do I make myself clear, Mr. MacMan?

46:07.973 --> 46:08.807
Because...

46:10.476 --> 46:11.810
I won't hesitate.

46:11.810 --> 46:15.105
I will shoot you right here, right now,

46:15.105 --> 46:16.732
right where you stand.

46:17.608 --> 46:21.695
Do I make myself clear, Mr. MacMan?

46:24.156 --> 46:29.161
(sinister laughing)
(suspenseful music)

46:44.718 --> 46:48.180
(overlapping city sounds)

47:02.444 --> 47:05.739
(rhythmic music)

47:05.739 --> 47:10.744
(overlapping chattering)
(pop surf music)

47:10.744 --> 47:12.120
- Look at this menu.

47:13.455 --> 47:17.042
This is George's favorite thing
to eat, burgers and shakes.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.503
He loved it more than
anything else in this world.

47:20.754 --> 47:23.757
Well, not the hot plate of corn beef hash.

47:23.757 --> 47:26.802
George loved that, too. (laughing)

47:26.802 --> 47:29.596
On the other hand, he
really didn't like liver.

47:29.596 --> 47:32.850
I mean, I couldn't get that
man to eat liver. (laughing)

47:32.850 --> 47:35.102
- Well my Uncle Ben always
takes us to this burger place

47:35.102 --> 47:36.061
in Pennsylvania.

47:36.895 --> 47:38.480
It's up near Milford.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.524
Madison's Madness.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.068
They're famous for being
crazy with their food.

47:43.068 --> 47:45.904
- (laughing) I have no
idea what that means.

47:45.904 --> 47:47.781
- They form characters out of their food.

47:47.781 --> 47:49.908
Well, let's say for instance,

47:49.908 --> 47:52.494
you order a short stack of pancakes.

47:52.494 --> 47:54.079
They call it the village.

47:54.079 --> 47:56.498
And they design it to look like a scene

47:56.498 --> 47:57.791
from the three little pigs. (laughing)

47:57.791 --> 47:59.418
- [Bethany] No!

47:59.418 --> 48:01.795
- Well, the pancakes will be the house

48:01.795 --> 48:04.006
with the little sausages
living inside of it.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.591
It's the three little pigs.

48:05.591 --> 48:07.134
That's what I mean, weird stuff like that.

48:07.134 --> 48:08.802
- That sounds like a cute place.

48:08.802 --> 48:09.636
- It is.

48:10.929 --> 48:12.389
It's fun.

48:12.389 --> 48:14.016
It's a bit odd but fun.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.809
Traditionally, we go
there after he takes us

48:15.809 --> 48:18.103
to see the civil war reenactments.

48:18.103 --> 48:18.896
It's cool,

48:18.896 --> 48:21.690
they dress up and they
reenact the battles.

48:21.690 --> 48:24.109
- Wow, it sounds exciting.
- It's cool, it's cool.

48:24.109 --> 48:25.819
- George is such a history buff,

48:25.819 --> 48:28.614
he would have loved that. (laughs)

48:28.614 --> 48:31.241
- But do you know what
I really find weird is?

48:31.241 --> 48:34.119
Okay, I have another cousin,

48:34.119 --> 48:36.038
lives in Wilmington, North Carolina.

48:37.164 --> 48:41.418
They, too, have a civil
war reenactment. (laughing)

48:41.418 --> 48:43.754
- Okay, so what's wrong with that?

48:43.754 --> 48:46.673
- Well, well, you're in the South.

48:46.673 --> 48:48.133
I mean, you lost the war.

48:48.967 --> 48:50.844
Why would you want to
continue to reenact something

48:50.844 --> 48:52.137
that you lost?

48:52.137 --> 48:54.264
It's not like the outcome
is going to be different.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.557
I mean, am I right?

48:55.557 --> 48:57.309
- [Bethany] (laughing) You're right.

48:59.019 --> 49:00.562
- Excuse me, would you mind moving

49:00.562 --> 49:01.980
to the other side of the room?

49:01.980 --> 49:04.733
(surf pop music)

49:12.491 --> 49:13.784
- Chip, don't move.

49:16.036 --> 49:17.996
(music abruptly stops)

49:17.996 --> 49:19.247
No, thank you.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.749
We're fine right here.

49:22.584 --> 49:24.336
- Look, I don't want any trouble.

49:24.336 --> 49:25.629
Just eat your food and go.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.010
- I hate bigots.

49:33.178 --> 49:33.971
- That's okay.

49:41.186 --> 49:42.020
Thank you,

49:43.355 --> 49:44.648
for what you just did.

49:46.608 --> 49:47.609
That meant a lot.

49:48.610 --> 49:53.615
(pensive instrumental music)
(overlapping chattering)

49:56.076 --> 49:57.327
- Do you think he's okay?

50:03.041 --> 50:05.210
- We're gonna find him, Ms. Bethany.

50:05.210 --> 50:06.003
- I'm mean this,

50:07.504 --> 50:09.840
this is just so not like George.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.259
He was just by the book,
by the book of rules,

50:12.259 --> 50:13.552
thoughtful, punctual.

50:13.552 --> 50:14.636
Even if he was going to
be a few minutes late,

50:14.636 --> 50:15.929
he always called.

50:15.929 --> 50:17.347
- Well, well, we, we...

50:18.265 --> 50:20.350
we searched all the hospitals in the area.

50:21.643 --> 50:25.022
We visited all the surrounding
area police stations.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.149
I mean, they're even helping us with this,

50:27.149 --> 50:29.735
so I don't even know
what else we could do.

50:29.735 --> 50:33.530
(pensive instrumental music)

50:34.781 --> 50:37.284
- I just feel like the
only thing we can do is,

50:37.284 --> 50:38.368
what we've been doing.

50:39.953 --> 50:41.538
Back track his steps.

50:41.538 --> 50:45.250
(pensive instrumental music)

50:46.126 --> 50:48.336
- Well, what's next on that list of yours?

50:48.336 --> 50:51.131
(pensive instrumental music)

50:51.131 --> 50:53.550
- Hi, are you ready to order?

50:53.550 --> 50:57.012
(overlapping chattering)

51:04.019 --> 51:06.772
(birds chirping)

51:09.733 --> 51:10.984
- Hello?

51:10.984 --> 51:13.695
(birds chirping)

51:15.906 --> 51:17.491
(door creaking)

51:17.491 --> 51:18.992
Hello?

51:18.992 --> 51:21.787
(birds chirping)

51:21.787 --> 51:22.996
Howard?

51:22.996 --> 51:25.832
(birds chirping)

51:25.832 --> 51:28.835
(suspenseful music)

51:35.717 --> 51:37.594
(light knocking) Hello?

51:37.594 --> 51:42.599
(birds chirping)
(suspenseful music)

51:44.017 --> 51:45.018
Howard?

51:45.018 --> 51:46.520
Howard Caine?

51:46.520 --> 51:49.523
(suspenseful music)

51:54.736 --> 51:56.655
Howard, hello?

51:56.655 --> 51:58.198
I'm George Lazarus.

51:58.198 --> 52:01.326
(suspenseful music)

52:12.504 --> 52:14.256
(light knocking) Howard?

52:15.423 --> 52:16.550
Mr. Caine?

52:16.550 --> 52:19.511
(suspenseful music)

52:20.887 --> 52:24.057
(door creaking)

52:24.057 --> 52:26.226
Hello? (light knocking)

52:26.226 --> 52:29.354
(suspenseful music)

52:29.354 --> 52:30.355
Hello, Mr. Caine.

52:30.355 --> 52:33.400
(suspenseful music)

52:37.445 --> 52:38.655
(light knocking) Hello?

52:39.865 --> 52:40.782
(suspenseful music)

52:40.782 --> 52:41.658
Howard?

52:43.076 --> 52:44.119
Hello?

52:44.119 --> 52:47.122
(suspenseful music)

52:50.417 --> 52:51.418
Howard?

52:51.418 --> 52:53.378
(suspenseful music)

52:53.378 --> 52:54.171
Anybody home? (gasps)

52:54.171 --> 52:57.549
- [Eve] Poking around people's
property will get your shot.

52:57.549 --> 53:00.385
- Listen, I'm looking for Howard Caine.

53:00.385 --> 53:01.511
I'm George A. Lazarus.

53:01.511 --> 53:03.805
I work with Topaz Insurance.
- Insurance?

53:03.805 --> 53:04.598
- Is this his home?

53:04.598 --> 53:06.683
'Cause I was told that
I could find him here.

53:06.683 --> 53:07.809
I was told by Eddie,

53:07.809 --> 53:10.687
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie and Wanda Martinez?

53:10.687 --> 53:13.565
- What, I don't know them from Adam.

53:13.565 --> 53:15.275
(suspenseful music)

53:15.275 --> 53:16.568
Insurance, huh?

53:16.568 --> 53:19.154
(suspenseful music)

53:19.154 --> 53:21.156
Turn around.
(ominous music)

53:21.156 --> 53:22.824
Real slow.
- Sure, sure.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.161
- You can put your hands down.

53:26.161 --> 53:26.995
- Okay.

53:29.581 --> 53:30.999
- Insurance, huh?
- Yeah.

53:38.423 --> 53:39.883
- Yeah, Howard does live here.

53:41.593 --> 53:42.594
I'm his wife.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.264
May I get you something?

53:50.310 --> 53:53.188
Pop?

53:53.188 --> 53:55.315
Coffee, tea?

53:55.315 --> 53:56.358
- Pop sounds great.

53:57.776 --> 53:59.653
Much appreciated, madame.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.947
- (laughing) Oh, I am
not no madame, nmm, hmm.

54:08.453 --> 54:09.371
Name's Eve.

54:10.872 --> 54:12.290
Want one?

54:12.290 --> 54:13.166
- No thank you, no thank you.

54:13.166 --> 54:14.542
I don't smoke.

54:14.542 --> 54:16.503
Appreciate it.
- Really?

54:16.503 --> 54:17.337
Hmm.

54:19.172 --> 54:23.051
He's probably around back working
on that car in the garage.

54:24.052 --> 54:26.471
He loves tinkering on that thing.

54:27.472 --> 54:28.682
He's making it his life mission

54:28.682 --> 54:31.226
to get that car running again.

54:31.226 --> 54:33.895
(curious music)

54:36.523 --> 54:38.775
What'd you want to talk
to my husband about?

54:40.568 --> 54:42.487
Insurance?
- Yeah.

54:42.487 --> 54:44.489
- 'Cause we're not interested.

54:46.032 --> 54:47.242
Hell, it's hard enough to come up

54:47.242 --> 54:48.201
with the mortgage each month,

54:48.201 --> 54:49.661
for this here dump,

54:50.787 --> 54:53.790
ever since Howard lost
his job at the plant.

54:53.790 --> 54:56.835
(suspenseful music)

54:58.378 --> 54:59.838
Darned thing, too.

55:01.506 --> 55:03.925
Reward him as employee of the month.

55:03.925 --> 55:05.427
Gave him a case of smokes.

55:05.427 --> 55:07.929
Even put his picture in the paper.

55:07.929 --> 55:10.557
Smack dab on page seven of the Tribune,

55:10.557 --> 55:12.684
right next to Bogart dying.

55:12.684 --> 55:15.353
(suspenseful music)

55:15.353 --> 55:16.688
So strange.

55:19.065 --> 55:20.442
- Is that right?
- Hmm hmm.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.527
- I told Howard, see,

55:22.527 --> 55:24.237
you ain't even gotta be a movie star

55:24.237 --> 55:27.532
to get in the paper. (laughs)

55:27.532 --> 55:30.410
Just have to do business with the devil.

55:32.245 --> 55:33.246
- The devil?

55:34.622 --> 55:35.999
I don't understand.

55:41.254 --> 55:43.340
- My husband isn't right.

55:44.716 --> 55:45.550
He's sick.

55:47.677 --> 55:49.554
He got some kind of bug at the plant.

55:56.144 --> 55:57.896
I took him to the doctors

55:57.896 --> 55:59.731
and they stated that,

55:59.731 --> 56:02.609
maybe he got stung by some killer bee

56:02.609 --> 56:04.569
or maybe he's allergic or something.

56:09.157 --> 56:09.991
See...

56:11.284 --> 56:12.786
We have a beehive in the back

56:12.786 --> 56:14.454
and Howard tends to them all the time.

56:14.454 --> 56:16.122
So he is not allergic!

56:19.000 --> 56:21.211
No.
(suspenseful music)

56:21.211 --> 56:26.216
No, no sir.

56:26.508 --> 56:29.344
Something at that plant
did something to my Howard.

56:30.595 --> 56:33.640
- Eve, I need to speak to Howard.

56:33.640 --> 56:34.474
I've got to sit down.

56:34.474 --> 56:35.308
I got to talk to him.

56:35.308 --> 56:36.768
I got to ask him some routine questions,

56:36.768 --> 56:38.061
I need to get answered.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.354
- He's in the back.

56:39.354 --> 56:42.357
(suspenseful music)

56:45.443 --> 56:46.444
- Thank you.

56:47.612 --> 56:48.696
Good day.

56:48.696 --> 56:51.658
(suspenseful music)

57:27.652 --> 57:31.656
(birds chirping)
(slight groaning)

57:31.656 --> 57:33.366
- Howard, Mr. Caine?

57:34.451 --> 57:37.203
(metal clanking)

57:39.456 --> 57:42.709
- I heard you talking
to my wife, Mr. Lazarus.

57:46.212 --> 57:49.090
Normally, I would introduce myself

57:49.090 --> 57:51.176
and shake your hand.

57:54.679 --> 57:56.681
But the way you're staring at me suggests

57:56.681 --> 58:01.686
I must look worse than I
did yesterday. (gasping)

58:04.189 --> 58:06.107
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Caine.

58:06.107 --> 58:07.317
I didn't mean to.

58:07.317 --> 58:08.860
- Tell you the truth (gasping),

58:09.777 --> 58:11.404
I haven't looked at myself today.

58:12.906 --> 58:15.825
I didn't like what I
saw yesterday. (laughs)

58:20.788 --> 58:23.458
- Mr. Caine.
- Doctors tell me...

58:23.458 --> 58:26.127
Nothing's wrong. (gasping)

58:31.007 --> 58:32.467
- Sir?

58:32.467 --> 58:34.511
I'm here, I'm investigating a claim

58:34.511 --> 58:36.471
that was placed by your former employer,

58:36.471 --> 58:37.805
Deadly Sin Cigarettes.

58:38.723 --> 58:41.643
- I don't feel like
talking much these days,

58:41.643 --> 58:44.187
especially about those bastards.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.440
So, I won't waste your time.

58:49.567 --> 58:50.860
Head down to the lounge.

58:52.904 --> 58:55.281
On Vermont. (gasping)

58:55.281 --> 58:56.449
See Roger Abel.

58:58.326 --> 58:59.452
- Roger Abel?

59:00.828 --> 59:02.372
Sir, I don't have a Roger Abel.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.791
I don't have a Roger Abel
on my list, Mr. Caine.

59:04.791 --> 59:07.460
(labored breathing)

59:07.460 --> 59:08.795
Mr. Caine.

59:08.795 --> 59:11.881
- You must have the
employee of the month list.

59:11.881 --> 59:13.174
Roger wouldn't be on that.

59:15.051 --> 59:16.469
But he was there.

59:17.595 --> 59:21.641
And he was let go, as well. (gasping)

59:21.641 --> 59:22.475
Well...

59:24.310 --> 59:25.186
Talk to Roger.

59:25.979 --> 59:27.355
He loves to talk.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.483
Now, I'd appreciate it,

59:30.483 --> 59:33.903
if you let me be. (gasping)

59:33.903 --> 59:35.405
Please, please go.

59:36.781 --> 59:39.617
Please (gasping).

59:41.911 --> 59:43.079
- Good day, Mr. Caine.

59:44.289 --> 59:47.875
(Howard breathing heavily)

1:00:03.725 --> 1:00:06.519
(Howard sobbing)

1:00:12.817 --> 1:00:16.362
(Howard breathing heavily)

1:00:25.121 --> 1:00:29.751
My Lord. (gasps)

1:00:29.751 --> 1:00:32.629
I'm sorry for my sins.

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:34.130
With my all heart,

1:00:37.050 --> 1:00:40.136
in choosing to do wrong.

1:00:40.136 --> 1:00:42.013
I'm saying to you, God.

1:00:43.139 --> 1:00:45.892
(Howard sobbing)

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:50.313
I've sinned against you.

1:00:54.484 --> 1:00:57.278
(Howard sobbing)

1:01:04.577 --> 1:01:09.582

(somber music)

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:13.378
(suspenseful music)

1:02:04.929 --> 1:02:08.057
- Hello?
(dramatic music)

1:02:08.057 --> 1:02:09.851
(ominous music)

1:02:09.851 --> 1:02:11.018
Mrs. Caine?

1:02:11.018 --> 1:02:13.688
(ominous music)

1:02:24.365 --> 1:02:25.241
Hello!

1:02:26.659 --> 1:02:29.370
(ominous music)

1:02:31.289 --> 1:02:33.833
(door rattling)

1:02:33.833 --> 1:02:35.960
- You find anything?
- No.

1:02:38.254 --> 1:02:40.882
(ominous music)

1:02:44.385 --> 1:02:47.096
(door squeaking)

1:02:48.723 --> 1:02:49.974
- Ms. Bethany!
- What?

1:02:49.974 --> 1:02:51.392
- This door is open.

1:02:51.392 --> 1:02:52.894
- Let's see if someone's inside.

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:55.271
(dog barking)

1:02:55.271 --> 1:02:56.856
Ready?

1:02:56.856 --> 1:02:58.858
- [Chip] Yep, I'm ready.

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:01.903
- [Bethany] Hello!

1:03:10.703 --> 1:03:13.122
- Now why did I know that
it was going to happen?

1:03:14.123 --> 1:03:17.001
Oh, I have a light that
I use for my camera.

1:03:17.001 --> 1:03:18.127
It doesn't last long,

1:03:18.127 --> 1:03:21.047
maybe 30 minutes or so.
- Okay.

1:03:21.047 --> 1:03:22.048
- But the only thing is,

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:24.801
it burns off the battery of the camera

1:03:25.718 --> 1:03:28.513
and it burns a lot of battery juice.

1:03:28.513 --> 1:03:30.723
Well, I was planning on
shooting footage anyway, so.

1:03:30.723 --> 1:03:32.600
- Let's just get it working.

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:34.310
I don't want to be here
any longer than we have to,

1:03:34.310 --> 1:03:36.437
but yes, we should always
document everything.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:40.149
- [Chip] The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

1:03:40.149 --> 1:03:41.025
- Hello?

1:03:42.819 --> 1:03:44.070
- Now this feels wrong.

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:48.574
It feels like a Vincent Price movie.

1:03:49.659 --> 1:03:51.327
In one of his movies,

1:03:51.327 --> 1:03:53.579
these people, they were trapped and-

1:03:53.579 --> 1:03:57.083
- Now just, I, you know how
I feel about horror movies.

1:03:57.083 --> 1:03:58.125
Mrs. Caine!

1:03:59.043 --> 1:04:01.462
(loud thumping)

1:04:01.462 --> 1:04:02.505
Who's that?

1:04:02.505 --> 1:04:04.382
- Well, of course, it's
going to be strange noises

1:04:04.382 --> 1:04:07.176
coming from a dark house
we're walking through.

1:04:07.176 --> 1:04:10.221
Maybe the pod creatures from outer space.

1:04:10.221 --> 1:04:12.056
Did you and Mr. George ever
see last summer's film,

1:04:12.056 --> 1:04:13.349
Invasion of a-
- Stop it Benjamin!

1:04:13.349 --> 1:04:15.518
I don't like horror movies.

1:04:15.518 --> 1:04:17.144
- I'm sorry, Ms. Bethany.

1:04:17.144 --> 1:04:19.689
(loud thumping)
(Bethany gasps)

1:04:19.689 --> 1:04:22.567
- Besides, the sound came from upstairs.

1:04:24.068 --> 1:04:26.779
- Well, now you're beginning
to scare me, Ms. Bethany.

1:04:28.656 --> 1:04:29.782
(eerie noise)

1:04:29.782 --> 1:04:30.992
Uh, what now?

1:04:30.992 --> 1:04:32.410
- What, what, what's going on?

1:04:32.410 --> 1:04:34.161
- I'm not sure.

1:04:34.161 --> 1:04:35.413
- What's going on?

1:04:35.413 --> 1:04:37.707
You told me that thing was
going to last 30 minutes.

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:38.541
- I know-

1:04:38.541 --> 1:04:39.417
- And it's only been nearly 10.

1:04:39.417 --> 1:04:40.251
(eerie sound)

1:04:40.251 --> 1:04:41.168
- Oh shoot.

1:04:42.128 --> 1:04:46.549
Well, the battery life
is still good. (murmurs)

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:48.259
It's still rolling.

1:04:48.259 --> 1:04:50.261
Maybe the light has a
short on it, some way?

1:04:50.261 --> 1:04:52.722
(eerie sound)

1:05:03.399 --> 1:05:06.694
(dramatic screaming)

1:05:06.694 --> 1:05:09.572
(zombie snarling)

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:12.408
(eerie music)

1:05:12.408 --> 1:05:14.535
(Bethany gasping)

1:05:14.535 --> 1:05:16.037
What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1:05:16.037 --> 1:05:18.331
- That definitely wasn't no Vincent Price.

1:05:18.331 --> 1:05:20.541
- We gotta, we gotta call the police.

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:22.919
We've got to get you to
a hospital, oh my God.

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:24.837
- No, I wanna go back
in there and shoot it.

1:05:24.837 --> 1:05:25.630
- No, no!

1:05:25.630 --> 1:05:26.547
- I wanna go in there and shoot it.

1:05:26.547 --> 1:05:27.340
- No, we don't even know what that is.

1:05:27.340 --> 1:05:28.174
We don't even know what it is.

1:05:28.174 --> 1:05:29.425
- The gun was on the counter.

1:05:29.425 --> 1:05:30.259
We can go in there and shoot it.

1:05:30.259 --> 1:05:31.135
- No, no, we have to call the police.

1:05:31.135 --> 1:05:32.219
- We can shoot it.
- Call the police.

1:05:32.219 --> 1:05:34.347
We've gotta get you to a hos-

1:05:34.347 --> 1:05:37.016
(eerie music)

1:05:37.016 --> 1:05:37.850
My Lord.

1:05:38.726 --> 1:05:39.852
What is that?

1:05:40.853 --> 1:05:41.979
(ominous music)

1:05:41.979 --> 1:05:44.690
- Mrs. Bethany, I'm okay to run now.

1:05:44.690 --> 1:05:46.025
(eerie music)

1:05:46.025 --> 1:05:46.859
- Let's go.

1:05:46.859 --> 1:05:49.570

1:05:58.454 --> 1:06:01.874

1:06:13.886 --> 1:06:14.720
- What can I get ya?

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:16.722
- I'm here to see Roger.

1:06:16.722 --> 1:06:18.182
Roger Abel.

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:19.475
- Never heard of him.

1:06:19.475 --> 1:06:20.893
- Howard sent me.

1:06:20.893 --> 1:06:21.686
Howard Caine.

1:06:23.187 --> 1:06:24.814

I'm an insurance investigator.

1:08:22.181 --> 1:08:23.766
I work with Topaz Insurance.

1:08:23.766 --> 1:08:26.477

1:08:26.477 --> 1:08:27.311
Mr. Lazarus.

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:31.732
- Oh, you know, I'm sure
my fiance is worried.

1:08:31.732 --> 1:08:33.943
No, I'm not out selling, Roger.

1:08:33.943 --> 1:08:37.029
I'm investigating a claim
from Deadly Sins Cigarettes.

1:08:38.322 --> 1:08:41.117
You know, hey man, it's
a bit dark in here.

1:08:42.618 --> 1:08:43.828
You think we can get

1:08:43.828 --> 1:08:46.956
I mean, a fellow could
definitely lose a step.

1:08:49.625 --> 1:08:50.459
- No.

1:08:52.878 --> 1:08:54.380
They will be watching us.

If they can't see you,

1:08:58.634 --> 1:08:59.468
they'll miss you.

1:09:02.388 --> 1:09:03.472

1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:12.648
- The dead folks.

1:09:14.817 --> 1:09:17.695
You say you're here
from a former employer?

1:09:17.695 --> 1:09:18.654
Which one?

1:09:18.654 --> 1:09:19.780
- No, no, Roger.

1:09:19.780 --> 1:09:22.783
I'm with the company your former
employee has a claim with.

1:09:32.459 --> 1:09:33.377
You wanna take some brandy?

1:09:33.377 --> 1:09:36.088
You know, some brandy will do
some wonders for you, Roger.

1:09:43.804 --> 1:09:45.181
I already got me a lawyer.

1:09:46.390 --> 1:09:47.600
- No, look, I'm no lawyer.

1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:49.685
Heavens, I'm not a lawyer.

1:09:49.685 --> 1:09:51.187
The have some routine questions.

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:54.315
I need to speak to about your
dismissal from the plant.

1:09:54.315 --> 1:09:56.275
I need to get them answered.

1:09:59.153 --> 1:10:01.113
Roger, what happened at that plant?

1:10:02.823 --> 1:10:04.158

(Roger grunting)

1:12:20.169 --> 1:12:21.420
- Oh my God!

1:12:21.420 --> 1:12:26.383
(dramatic music)
(body thumps)

1:12:29.053 --> 1:12:31.972
That, was not my Roger.

1:12:33.474 --> 1:12:34.975
I looked into his eyes.

1:12:35.976 --> 1:12:36.977
He wasn't there.

1:12:38.562 --> 1:12:39.396
(suspenseful music)

1:12:39.396 --> 1:12:41.690
- Look, look, look, look, we
need to call the authorities.

1:12:41.690 --> 1:12:42.608
Right now!

1:12:43.859 --> 1:12:46.570
(suspenseful music)

1:12:46.570 --> 1:12:48.989
- He was trying to tell me something.

1:12:48.989 --> 1:12:51.450
(suspenseful music)

1:12:51.450 --> 1:12:53.160
I couldn't understand him, though.

1:12:54.078 --> 1:12:58.999
Maybe because, my scissors
were in his throat.

1:12:58.999 --> 1:13:00.584
(suspenseful music)

1:13:00.584 --> 1:13:01.377
- You!

1:13:03.045 --> 1:13:04.004
I know you!

1:13:05.923 --> 1:13:07.591
- My Roger.

1:13:07.591 --> 1:13:10.052
(suspenseful music)

1:13:10.052 --> 1:13:10.886
It wasn't him.

1:15:46.833 --> 1:15:49.044

1:15:49.044 --> 1:15:49.878
I love it.

1:15:55.842 --> 1:15:57.469
Is this where it all happened?

1:15:57.469 --> 1:15:59.555
The alien abductions?

1:15:59.555 --> 1:16:00.472
- Supposedly.

1:16:01.515 --> 1:16:03.183
It's what I heard.

1:16:03.183 --> 1:16:06.562
You know, the Russians are smart.

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:08.355
They're ready for an alien invasion.

1:16:09.356 --> 1:16:12.067
And I say, the American
government, they're jealous.

1:16:12.067 --> 1:16:14.361
They're jealous because
the Russians are ready

1:16:14.361 --> 1:16:16.655
for serious battle with little green men.

1:16:16.655 --> 1:16:19.908
- Russians are so smart and sexy.

1:16:20.826 --> 1:16:23.203
Now I understand why
they made Spot Nicholas.

1:16:24.413 --> 1:16:25.956
- Sputnik?

1:16:25.956 --> 1:16:28.917
Exactly, and that's why
Elvis wants to join the Army.

1:16:28.917 --> 1:16:30.085
He wants to fight, too.

1:16:35.841 --> 1:16:38.510

1:16:39.344 --> 1:16:40.220

1:16:41.263 --> 1:16:43.223
- What about Jimmy Star?

1:16:43.223 --> 1:16:45.100

1:16:45.100 --> 1:16:47.728

I was thinking tomorrow I
can borrow my dad's wheels
