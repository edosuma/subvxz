WEBVTT

00:01.377 --> 00:03.242
And you're sure
he didn't leave
until after 9:00?

00:03.379 --> 00:06.667
Absolutely.
We watched the Devils
demolish the Rangers.

00:06.757 --> 00:07.917
The game started
at 7:00.

00:08.092 --> 00:10.083
Neither of you
stepped out
between periods?

00:10.178 --> 00:11.384
Get beer,
pick up a pizza?

00:11.470 --> 00:13.597
We stayed at my place,
we were together
the whole time.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.131
And you said
the Devils won?
Yeah. Four-zip.

00:16.434 --> 00:18.971
Kovalchuk had two,
Arnott and Parise
each had one,

00:19.103 --> 00:20.434
and Marty
got the shutout.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.432
I'm sorry? Marty?

00:23.274 --> 00:24.889
Martin Brodeur,

00:24.984 --> 00:27.441
Devils' starting goalie
for, like,
the past 20 years.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.106
He played awesome,
as usual.

00:29.238 --> 00:33.106
Your Honor, may I submit
the sports page from
the New Jersey Chronic/e

00:33.284 --> 00:34.945
on October 9th, 2011?

00:35.077 --> 00:36.613
Objection. Relevance.

00:36.746 --> 00:37.986
Goes to the witness'
credibility.

00:38.164 --> 00:39.279
Go quickly.

00:42.293 --> 00:45.581
Would you please
read the caption
under the photo?

00:47.965 --> 00:51.423
(CLEARING THROAT)
"Martin Brodeur stops
one of his 36 saves

00:51.510 --> 00:53.592
"on the way
to a shutout victory."

00:54.805 --> 00:55.794
That's what I just said.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.597
That the defendant
couldn't have possibly
committed the robbery

00:58.768 --> 00:59.928
because he was with you,

01:00.019 --> 01:01.555
watching Martin Brodeur
shut out the Rangers.

01:01.646 --> 01:02.761
Yes.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.265
Thank you.

01:04.815 --> 01:09.024
Your Honor, may I submit
the Chronicle sports page
from October 10th?

01:09.320 --> 01:11.311
Your Honor...
This is what you
call going quickly?

01:11.447 --> 01:13.483
Just two more questions.
I promise.

01:17.036 --> 01:20.324
Please read
the highlighted text
at the bottom of the page.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.493
"ln Sunday's
sports section,

01:22.625 --> 01:26.664
"New Jersey
Devils' goaltender,

That's it. Keep going.

..misidentified
as Martin Brodeur

and box score."

01:39.600 --> 01:41.261
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

01:44.981 --> 01:46.187
An understandable mistake

01:46.983 --> 01:50.646
given that Martin Brodeur
was scheduled to start,
but bowed out

01:51.070 --> 01:54.358
after taking a shot to
the throat in warm-up.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.197
Which brings me to
my most relevant question.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.993
Did you and the defendant
spend the evening
of October 8th

02:01.414 --> 02:03.075
watching
the Devils game on TV,

02:03.207 --> 02:05.198
or did you just
read about the game
in the Chronicle

02:05.334 --> 02:07.871
while concocting
this false alibi?

02:12.633 --> 02:13.622
(CLEARING THROAT)

02:15.052 --> 02:17.259
Excuse me, Your Honor,
may I approach?

02:17.388 --> 02:18.503
You sure
you don't want to wait

02:18.597 --> 02:19.973
till after he answers
yourquesﬂon?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.263
No.

02:23.436 --> 02:24.721
I'm gonna
need a continuance.

02:24.937 --> 02:27.974
Now? You're one answer away
from destroying
their whole defense.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.225
Your Honor...
Oh, shut up.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.352
You know it's true.

02:30.443 --> 02:32.024
Let's finish this up.
I can't.

02:32.570 --> 02:33.605
Why the hell not?

02:34.071 --> 02:37.734
Because I think
I'm having a heart attack.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.037
JUDGE FOLEY: Great.
Call an ambulance.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.075
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:21.285 --> 03:23.401
FOREMAN: Thinks he had
a heart attack,
but didn't.

03:23.496 --> 03:27.364
His EKG, cardiac enzymes
and catheterization
are all normal.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.824
Becauseits
an anxiety attack.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.875
Probably because
he just turned 40

03:31.962 --> 03:33.122
and still goes by
the name "Tommy."

03:33.297 --> 03:34.377
It's not anxiety.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.046
I had the ER docs
interview his wife,

03:36.133 --> 03:37.589
she confirmed he's
been feeling fine.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.337
Nothing out of
the ordinary at work
or at home.

03:39.470 --> 03:43.179
She probably also believes
that he thinks Salma Hayek's
breasts are too big.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.093
Which is why I had
them admit him anyway

03:45.184 --> 03:47.345
and treat
with alprazolam.
No improvements.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.306
Because”.
Because for
some patients,

03:49.438 --> 03:53.272
the diagnosis of
anxiety disorder can
actually increase anxiety.

03:53.359 --> 03:56.647
Which is also why
I told him he had a minor
respiratory infection

03:56.779 --> 03:58.940
that was easily curable
by the medication.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.146
You lied?

04:00.658 --> 04:03.115
l ruled out heart attack
and anxiety disorder.

04:04.495 --> 04:05.985
Interesting.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.034
I know.

04:13.671 --> 04:14.706
TAU B:
Impressive.

04:15.714 --> 04:20.629
What, the wiliness
with which Foreman
ruled out anxiety,

04:20.719 --> 04:25.304
or his complete
wiliness-lessness
before he met me?

04:25.391 --> 04:29.475
The fact that you
managed to smearjelly
on nearly every page.

04:29.854 --> 04:32.220
Shingles could
cause chest pain
before a rash appeared.

04:32.565 --> 04:35.807
Pain would be restricted
to one dermatome,
not cross them.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.687
Asthma induced
pneumothorax would,

04:37.903 --> 04:40.019
and might not show up
on a posteroanterior x-ray.

04:40.156 --> 04:41.271
No history of asthma.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.356
They did
a lateral view as well.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.359
No sign of pneumothorax
or deep sulcus sign.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.326
I treated an inmate once
with similar symptoms

04:48.414 --> 04:50.496
after he tried to
poison his cellmate
with chlorine gas.

04:50.583 --> 04:53.541
He didn't realize
sharing a cell also meant
sharing the air?

04:53.669 --> 04:55.170
JESSICA: Chlorine gas
pools near the ground.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.369
He thought he'd be safe
in the top bunk.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.666
But why would anyone
try to poison our guy?

04:58.757 --> 05:00.293
TAUB: He makes a living
sending people to prison.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.171
But he's not in prison,
and it's kind of
hard to gas a guy

05:03.262 --> 05:04.843
unless you can seal him
in a room first.

05:04.930 --> 05:09.390
Which is why Arceus
created a universe with
three states of matter,

05:09.518 --> 05:13.102
and 300 solid
and liquid poisons that
could cause his symptoms.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.432
Arceus?

05:15.900 --> 05:18.687
Look it up.
And alkalinize his urine.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.233
Then search his home,
talk to his wife.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.148
See if you can
get her to tell us
what she used.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.696
Wait, why would you think
his wife poisoned him?

05:24.783 --> 05:28.776
Because dangerous people
don't break into your home,
they live in it.

05:28.913 --> 05:30.949
And although his kids
are old enough
to want Daddy dead,

05:31.081 --> 05:32.617
they're still too young
to do anything about it.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.412
It must be such a pleasure
to live in your head.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.285
You're right.
The kids might
be precocious.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.296
You handle his house.
You handle him
and his wife.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.086
They get to just
hang out and do nothing?

05:43.886 --> 05:45.717
If you need help,
you can take
whoever you want.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.545
I'll take Taub.
I'll take Taub.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.055
Interesting.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.178
No, it's not.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.056
It was a 50-50 choice.
I'm totally fine
with Taub or Park.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.808
Cool. I'll take Taub.

05:56.941 --> 05:57.930
And I'll take Park.

06:01.779 --> 06:02.859
That was fun.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.523
Not really.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.189
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

06:09.620 --> 06:12.953
Nice move, boss.
Lying to the patient.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.621
I had no choice.
I knew House wouldn't

06:14.708 --> 06:16.539
take the case unless
I ruled out anxiety.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.867
You need a girlfriend.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.122
To keep me from
lying to patients?

06:19.255 --> 06:20.870
To give you
the excitement you need

06:20.965 --> 06:22.045
so you don't go
looking for it.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.463
You're not working
for House anymore.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.049
Which means you
no longer have him
to blame if you get caught.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.127
I'm not looking
for excitement,
I'm doing myjob.

06:28.264 --> 06:31.301
Part of which is
to make sure
House does his.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.553
Girlfriend might
not be so bad.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.805
It's less dangerous
than where you're headed,

06:35.938 --> 06:37.803
and that's from a guy
with one alimony

06:37.898 --> 06:40.389
and two
child support payments.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.319
JESSICA: It's this new
curve control thing.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.071
It automatically
slows the car

06:56.166 --> 06:58.418
when it senses
I'm taking a curve
too fast.

06:59.128 --> 07:00.993
You really think
I care about your car,

07:01.088 --> 07:02.794
or are you just trying
to avoid talking about

07:02.881 --> 07:04.132
why you don't
like working with me?

07:04.842 --> 07:05.957
There's nothing
to talk about.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.088
House liked poking
ant hills with a stick
when he was a kid,

07:09.179 --> 07:11.090
and now he wants to
do the same with us.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.672
House is an ass,
but he's an intuitive ass.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.310
He obviously
noticed something.

07:15.686 --> 07:18.678
Yeah, the fact that
we work well together.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.435
He thrives on conflict
and is looking for
someone to torment.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.811
Don't let it be us.

07:27.031 --> 07:29.022
OLIVIA: I don't see how
that's possible.

07:29.158 --> 07:32.116
Tommy's the most
popular guy
in his office.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.693
He's even had
defendants thank him
after they were sentenced.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.362
Why would
they thank him?

07:36.498 --> 07:37.954
Because he doesn't
treat them like scum.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.704
He makes them feel
like he's helping
by offering a plea,

07:40.794 --> 07:43.376
or even just by
letting them pay their debt
and clear their conscience.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.416
And even if someone
wanted to poison him,

07:45.507 --> 07:46.713
I don't see how
they would do it.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.963
He never eats
or drinks anything that
we haven't made at home.

07:50.054 --> 07:53.467
Wait, you mean, literally,
er,noteven
a bottle of water?

07:53.557 --> 07:54.637
No.

07:55.059 --> 07:57.391
So, he was obviously
afraid of something.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.303
Yeah.
Rats, mice, cockroaches.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.980
My first job
out of law school was
at the Health Department.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.433
If you'd seen
some of the kitchens

08:05.527 --> 08:06.903
and the processing
plants I have,

08:07.696 --> 08:09.232
you'd cook all
your own food, too.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.314
The poison wouldn't
have to be in food.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.741
Have you gotten
any strange letters
or packages recently?

08:15.829 --> 08:16.864
No.

08:17.623 --> 08:18.829
It also wouldn't
have had to be at work.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.199
We've got two young kids.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.875
There's definitely
no poisons

08:23.962 --> 08:25.498
I could've accidentally
been exposed to at home.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.965
What if it wasn't
an accident?

08:30.052 --> 08:32.008
How are things
between you
and your wife?

08:32.096 --> 08:33.552
(LAUGHS)

08:33.639 --> 08:37.427
Are you asking me
if I think my wife
is trying to kill me?

08:38.936 --> 08:40.301
Yes. I am.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.940
Absolutely not.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.106
This is coming from a man
whose eyes are wide open.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.150
I've prosecuted hundreds
of despicable acts

08:49.321 --> 08:52.859
by husbands, wives, parents.
I can assure you...

08:52.991 --> 08:54.322
I love my husband.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.867
And lwould not ever,
even for a second,

08:56.954 --> 08:58.785
consider doing anything
to hurt him.

09:00.290 --> 09:04.158
No pesticides,
fertilizers,
or fuel in the garage.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.288
You find anything?

09:05.379 --> 09:08.621
No. There's not even
a bottle of Wite-Out
in this place.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.831
Maybe we should
look again.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.750
Maybe we should leave
before the police get here.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.382
Well, even if a neighbor
saw us break in
and called 911,

09:15.639 --> 09:17.550
unless they
said we were armed,
it's low priority.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.926
We've got
another five minutes.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.884
He's a prosecutor.
Obviously he knows
a lot of cops.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.891
His house is not
gonna be a low priority.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.681
Good point.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.562
Wait.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.272
The dining room's
on the other side
of that wall.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.401
Yeah, so?

09:36.076 --> 09:39.193
But it ends, like,
3 feet further over.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.077
You gotta be kidding me.

you wanted to
run like hell

09:42.583 --> 09:45.666
and now you want to look
for secret passages?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.745
There's a magnet
on the fridge they use

09:49.840 --> 09:52.297
to open child proofed
cabinets. Go get it.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.338

into the wrong house.

10:57.699 --> 10:58.905
Then you have
creepy neighbors

10:59.034 --> 11:01.070
because there were
photos of you
and your kids all over.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.914
I don't understand.
How could this...

11:09.753 --> 11:12.335
I had it put in during
the remodel last year.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.878
But we went over
the plans together.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.465
It's not on the plans.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.712
I didn't want the city
to know about it.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.212
I'm sorry.

11:21.557 --> 11:24.424
I should've told you.
I just...

11:25.561 --> 11:27.267
I didn't want you
and the kids to worry.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.434
About what?

11:30.065 --> 11:34.058
Tommy, what is it?
Why would you think
you needed so many guns?

11:36.780 --> 11:38.190
(SIGHS)

11:41.577 --> 11:42.612
You're not gonna
believe this.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.614
(SPEAKING LATIN)

11:47.499 --> 11:49.160
He's worried that
"Too big to fail"

11:49.251 --> 11:51.082
applies to our banks
but not our government.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.576
How'd you know?

11:52.671 --> 11:54.252
Because it's what
every idiot with a bunker

11:54.339 --> 11:56.170
full of assault rifles
is scared of.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.127
Heather Sweeney?

12:00.304 --> 12:02.636
It'll just be
a couple minutes till
someone's ready to see you.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.380
Maybe it's not stupidity,
it's a symptom.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.727
Cocaine abuse
can cause paranoia
and chest pain.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.644
This isn't
necessarily paranoia.
Societies do fall apart.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.596
Look what happened
with London in the riots.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.898
There's a difference
between an isolated riot

12:14.985 --> 12:16.475
and the fall
of civilization.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.273
April Donaldson?

12:19.615 --> 12:20.695
Sorry, misspoke.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.860
Imagine what would
happen if there was
a terrorist attack

12:22.951 --> 12:24.191
on the food supply,

12:24.328 --> 12:26.910
or a pandemic
where we had to
ration the antibiotics.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.112
That's ridiculous.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.571
Ouch.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.829
Oh, shut up. We know
what you're trying to do
and it's not gonna work.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.040
It was a little harsh.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.045
Stop being so...

12:38.175 --> 12:39.335
What? Paranoid?

12:39.468 --> 12:41.550
You're gonna
look pretty foolish
if that was a wrong guess.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.418
I think
you're a good person
and a fine doctor,

12:43.513 --> 12:45.765
but it's ridiculous
to think anyone needs

12:45.849 --> 12:47.089
an arsenal
of assault weapons.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.890
He's obviously paranoid.
What about Fahr's disease?

12:49.061 --> 12:50.801
He's not hallucinating.
As far as we know.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.727
We should do
a mental status
examination

12:52.814 --> 12:54.145
and get a CT of
his basal ganglia.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.097
No, we shouldn't.
If it's not poison,

12:56.193 --> 12:57.603
it's most likely
atrial fibrillation

12:57.694 --> 13:00.527
brought on
by hyperthyroidism
or sleep apnea.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.733
(SPITS)

13:02.824 --> 13:05.201
Looks like we got ourselves
a good old fashioned
cat fight.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.318
No, we don't.
We have a reasoned
disagreement.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.403
Still, there's only
one way to settle this.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.496
Actually, there's two,
but we don't have

13:11.583 --> 13:13.164
enough Jell-O
for the first.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.084
Mini-mental, CT,
and get a hair sample

13:16.171 --> 13:17.707
to check
for past cocaine use.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.748
Check his TSH levels
and get a sleep study.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.336
Sorry, gotta make it
a fair fight,

13:22.427 --> 13:23.678
which means
you're stuck with her.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.093
He's not stuck with me.

13:25.681 --> 13:26.716
And it's not a fight.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.513
Excuse me, miss.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.718
What is your name?

13:32.854 --> 13:34.230
Mariel Wilkerson.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.228
Hah.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.725
You don't look
like a Mariel.
You're up.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.117
(BLINDS CLOSING)

13:54.084 --> 13:57.292
So what do you think?
Is the patient paranoid
or am I?

13:57.421 --> 14:00.128
I don't think
stockpiling weapons is
the most reasoned response,

14:00.257 --> 14:03.124
but given what I've
seen at Bloomingdales
on Black Friday,

14:03.260 --> 14:05.797
I wouldn't say it rises
to the level
of mental illness.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.259
And me?

14:09.975 --> 14:13.138
Again,
given what I've seen
at Bloomingdales...

14:14.104 --> 14:15.560
Don't let House
get to you.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.138
It's all of you. I feel
like you don't respect me.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.852
Chase certainly
didn't try to hide it.

14:19.943 --> 14:20.978
Chase respects you.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.351
He's just
more comfortable
working with me

14:22.446 --> 14:23.606
because he's
known me longer.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.312
And I'm notjust saying that
because you own a gun.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.775
I don't own a gun.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.649
I've thought about it,
but I'd probably

14:29.745 --> 14:31.281
end up shooting someone
in my own family.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.488
Like, when my brother
tosses his toenail clippings
behind the couch.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.789
What about you?

14:37.794 --> 14:39.409
If anarchy breaks out,

14:39.504 --> 14:43.873
I plan to do what
my ancestors have done
throughout the ages, run.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.174
FOREMAN:
Sounds like a good plan.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.338
You got a moment?

14:51.016 --> 14:53.223
Stop telling the nurses
I'm looking
for a girlfriend.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.928
What makes you...
Two lunch offers

14:55.020 --> 14:57.056
and a box of cupcakes
since this morning.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.059
So a few people
are nice to you and
your first thought is,

15:00.150 --> 15:01.481
"Hmm. This seems strange."

15:01.985 --> 15:03.725
I haven't even had time
to eat my own lunch,

15:04.029 --> 15:06.771
much less run around
trying to recruit nurses
for yours.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.401
So can I get back
to work?

15:12.162 --> 15:13.322
You're lying,
aren't you?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.408
It's for his own good.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.282
HOUSE: He's not paranoid,
he's just stupid.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.662
Well, shouldn't you
put yourself
in that group?

15:21.338 --> 15:22.373
You own a gun.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.589
Our patient
doesn't own a gun,
he owns an arsenal.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.928
And I don't own a gun.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.174
Yes, you do.
And you're a felon.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.380
So, you'll end up
back in jail...

15:33.517 --> 15:37.430
That is actually not
one of the many reasons
that I don't own a gun.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.563
Why would I need a gun?
The only thing I own
worth protecting,

15:41.691 --> 15:43.431
a thief would need a crane
to get out of my apartment.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.358
You don't own
anything you need.

15:45.529 --> 15:46.689
You own things you want.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.771
And you're
definitely the type
who'd want a gun.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.071
You like
anything dangerous.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.824
Monster trucks,
motorcycles, fireworks.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.367
Everyone loves fireworks.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.870
Watching them,
not making them.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.906
I'm telling the truth.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.033
I stand corrected.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.167
If you believe me,
then this issue
will be resolved

16:06.258 --> 16:08.044
with no further
action necessary.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.708
Absolutely.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.468
It's not resolved,
is it?

16:11.638 --> 16:12.718
Not even close.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.134
(DOOR OPENS)

16:16.476 --> 16:18.888
It's not cocaine.
Hair samples were clean.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.640
It's not looking good
for Fahr's either.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.345
I'm not seeing
any calcifications.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.520
You sure?

16:23.608 --> 16:26.475
They can be
pretty hard to detect
in people under 50.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.650
See?

16:27.737 --> 16:28.772
What?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.566
We all disagree
all the time.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.071
It's notjust
me and Park.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.818
Nice try, but I'm not
getting in the middle.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.237
So why didn't you want
to go with her
this morning?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.321
She's weird.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.827
She's not weird.
She's a good doctor.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.580
Most good doctors are weird.
Look at House.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.494
Am Iweird?

16:46.590 --> 16:49.127
Yeah, but you're hot,
so it's easier to
put up with.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.091
You're completely normal
and a pleasure to deal with.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.089
You're weird.

16:57.767 --> 16:58.756
In a good way?

16:59.978 --> 17:01.684
Maybe we should
just concentrate
on the medicine.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.266
You own any guns?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.437
That's not medicine.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.600
But it's related
to medicine. Kind of.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.313
What do you think?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.230
Yeah.
But not for protection.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.194
Despite what the media
would have us believe,

17:15.285 --> 17:16.991
you think we live
in a very safe world.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.622
You just think
they're fun.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.870
How did you know?

17:21.958 --> 17:22.993
Working in a prison,
you learned

17:23.084 --> 17:24.824
criminals rarely
target random strangers,

17:24.920 --> 17:26.660
and you've got
more money than
you know what to do with,

17:26.755 --> 17:29.838
so anything that
seems different and fun
is worth trying.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.168
And you?

17:31.259 --> 17:35.093
Not here in the States.
Back home, I keep a few
for hunting 'roos.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.670
You hunt kangaroos?

17:38.475 --> 17:39.590
But they're so cute.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.641
They're also delicious.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.015
You're screwing
with me.

17:45.357 --> 17:46.972
Totally.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.227
There's no calcification.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.938

we're both wrong.

until the morning.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.951
It's okay. I'll stay.

17:59.162 --> 18:02.654
Go. I'm sure
your mother's ready
for a break by now.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.200
Give the kids a kiss
for me.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.378
You think it's
the end of the world,
but you wanted kids.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.748
Oh, honey, come on.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.834
I don't think
the world's coming
to an end.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.262
Look.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.929
You have a spare tire
in your car, right?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.934
That's what
those guns are.

18:29.025 --> 18:32.358
I mean, I hope to God
I never have to use one.

and learn that
the entire banking system
has gone bankrupt overnight,

18:38.493 --> 18:41.200
it just seems stupid
not to have a jack
in the trunk.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.653
Just in case.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.367
And you've always...

I don't know.

You don't feel that?

18:50.755 --> 18:51.744
No.

a fever overnight.
Could be TB.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.176
You wanna say it?
Say what?

19:02.267 --> 19:05.304
There's no sign of
atelectasis or infiltrates
on the chest x-ray.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.556
Yeah.
That's med-speak for,
"She's an idiot."

19:07.731 --> 19:09.972
TAUB: Systemic sclerosis
can cause lower
extremity ulcers.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.772
It would have to
be pretty far along.

His first symptom was
just a few days ago.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.476

at least a year ago.

either not sclerosis,

19:20.410 --> 19:22.241
or it's extremely
aggressive sclerosis.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.071
We should biopsy
the skin lesion and
start him on enoxaparin.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.702
Shouldn't we wait
for the biopsy results
before we start treatment?

19:29.085 --> 19:32.202
Now's your chance.
She's leading
with her chin.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.412
I agree with her.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.497
No, you don't.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.508
Which means
you're both idiots.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.051
Get to work.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.183
I know you don't
think I'm an idiot.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.515
Does it matter?

19:49.606 --> 19:53.315
If you're just
looking to amuse yourself
at my expense, then no.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.483
But if you feel the need
to manipulate me

19:55.570 --> 19:57.652
to make me useful,
then yes.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.073
I thought we'd
gotten past that.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.739
lfwe hadn't
gotten past that,
you wouldn't be here.

20:01.826 --> 20:05.990
But ability
isn't always enough.
Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.495
So this is you
trying to help me?

20:07.582 --> 20:11.245
No, this is me helping me,
and amusing myself
at your expense.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.292
Which brings us back to,
why do you care?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.833
I deserve respect.
I'm a good doctor.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.711
People respect you.

20:18.802 --> 20:19.917
They just
don't like you.

Where's your wife?

She just needed some time.

It's not the guns,
it's...

20:37.320 --> 20:38.935

your first thought
was frostbite?

21:10.979 --> 21:13.220
Yeah. I guess
I was just going
by how it looks.

nothing like frostbite.

33:29.383 --> 33:30.418
Get a biopsy.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.083
You think it's cancer?

33:33.596 --> 33:35.382
I think you should
get a biopsy.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.438
Admit it.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.200
Two hours ago,
I found this
in your closet

33:55.284 --> 33:56.945
in a box
with your name on it.

33:57.286 --> 34:00.028
I knew you'd move it
somewhere outside
your apartment

34:00.122 --> 34:02.784
until you were certain
I'd given up looking.

34:02.875 --> 34:06.288
So, I had to convince you
that I'd given up looking.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.002
It's not a gun.

34:10.674 --> 34:11.925
(LAUGHS)

34:12.009 --> 34:15.126
Yes. It's a paperweight

34:15.221 --> 34:17.382
with a handy
storage compartment

34:17.514 --> 34:19.550
for .45-caliber bullets.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.722
And that's
not a bullet.
Admit it.

34:24.063 --> 34:27.226
I'm more clever
and more devious.
You can even have it back.

34:27.441 --> 34:28.897
It's not my problem if
you go back to prison.

34:28.984 --> 34:32.067
My problem is
you thinking you're always
one step ahead of me.

34:32.154 --> 34:34.566
This proves nothing,
because it's not a gun.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.241
It's a prop.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.445
From Dorothy Dietrich's
magic act.

34:39.912 --> 34:40.901
(LAUGHS)
Look it up.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.736
She's the only
woman ever to do
the catch a bullet trick.

34:42.957 --> 34:46.449
I won this
off her prop master
in a poker game.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.329
House”.
Itsfake.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.339
It's plugged.

34:53.968 --> 34:54.957
Look for yourself.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.043
Hey! Hey! Don't point
that thing at me.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.093
It's not dangerous
because it's not a gun.

34:59.348 --> 35:00.929
House”.
House, just stop it.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.515
Fine.

35:07.064 --> 35:09.350
What the hell
are you doing?

35:09.483 --> 35:11.269
Pull the trigger.
Don't be insane.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.520
They're blanks.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.021
You pull the trigger,

35:14.113 --> 35:17.105
l drool a little fake blood,
and I spit out the bullet

35:17.199 --> 35:18.780
that the audience thinks
I caught with my teeth.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.323
Go ahead. Shoot me.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.318
I'm not shooting you.

35:22.830 --> 35:23.865
All right.
l1lshootyou.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.241
Don't! House, don't!

35:27.459 --> 35:29.666
Even if they are blanks,
people will freak.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.666
It's not real.

35:34.967 --> 35:37.629
Which means
you didn't prove
that I have a gun,

35:37.761 --> 35:39.137
which means
you've proved nothing.

35:41.765 --> 35:42.800
Admit it.

35:50.399 --> 35:51.730
Admit it.

35:53.819 --> 35:54.979
All right.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.230
All right, what?

36:00.117 --> 36:01.152
You win.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.575
And it feels good.

36:06.290 --> 36:07.575
(GRUNTS)

36:37.112 --> 36:38.773
You were wrong.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.355
Don't feel too bad,
we all were.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.441
His trachea
wasn't swollen,
it was blocked.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.738
By a psuedomembrane
growing across it.

36:46.622 --> 36:50.456
Means he's not paranoid,
is an idiot,
and was poisoned.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.450
What are you doing?

36:54.046 --> 36:55.126
Give me a Machida scope.

36:56.799 --> 36:58.255
Hold his legs,
he's not gonna like this.

36:59.802 --> 37:02.885
Because you're not
gonna be able to breathe.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.553
(MONITOR BEEPING)

37:05.307 --> 37:07.923
But I need to see
down your barrel.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.140
Good news is,

37:13.607 --> 37:15.222
the poison didn't
come from your wife.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.729
It came from a little
bastard of a bacterium

37:17.820 --> 37:20.607
whose crap can
cause chest pain,

37:20.739 --> 37:22.980
respiratory distress,
skin ulcers,

37:23.659 --> 37:26.071
the growth
of pseudomembrane
across the airway,

37:26.161 --> 37:30.495
and in very rare cases,
hallucinations.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.372
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

37:38.507 --> 37:41.999
Call the CDC.
Tell them we need antitoxin
as soon as possible.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.129
Diphtheria?

37:43.345 --> 37:45.927
We didn't guess it
because nobody gets it.

37:46.098 --> 37:49.932
Instead of building bunkers,
you should be
getting boosters.

37:50.018 --> 37:53.431
As in the routine
vaccines against stuff
that is actually scary.

38:09.997 --> 38:11.362
Diphtheria?

38:12.666 --> 38:14.497
House pulled it
out of nowhere.

38:14.585 --> 38:15.700
(LAUGHS)

38:15.794 --> 38:16.954
Cool.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.120
You just getting in?

38:20.215 --> 38:23.799
I had a meeting
about a new parking
validation system.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.218
Cool.

38:28.557 --> 38:30.047
How are you feeling?

38:30.392 --> 38:31.757
Not great.

38:34.855 --> 38:35.890
But better.

38:38.775 --> 38:43.144
The antitoxin is working.
He'll be able to go home
in a few days.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.944
That's good news.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.067
But we've moved out.

38:49.745 --> 38:50.780
Oh, come on, honey.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.115
I'm sorry I lied, but...

38:53.207 --> 38:54.196
I know. Okay...

38:55.125 --> 38:57.912
It was for our own good,
but I don't care.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.707
I don't want to be lied to,
and I can't live like that.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.753
And I can't live
in that home.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.755
Oh, please, don't.

39:07.888 --> 39:08.923
I love you.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.053
I love you too,

39:14.144 --> 39:16.556
which is why
you're not gonna
live there either.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.475
I don't care if
we might need them.

39:19.942 --> 39:23.810
I just know that
I can't live my life
feeling like we do.

39:23.946 --> 39:26.107
It's not worth living
in fear.

39:29.451 --> 39:32.113
Okay. I'm sorry.

Hey.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.128
Thanks.

39:54.643 --> 39:57.601
You know,
there's a bunch of us going
to happy hour after work.

39:59.982 --> 40:02.439
I'm craving nachos.
You interested?

40:02.985 --> 40:05.351
Thanks,
but I got a lot of work
I need to get done.

40:05.487 --> 40:08.854
Sure. Well,
if you change your mind,
we'll be at Rudy's.

40:09.658 --> 40:10.647
Okay.

Hey.
Hey.

(SIGHS)

40:34.182 --> 40:37.515
Would you like
to get a drink
sometime after work?

40:38.520 --> 40:41.353
You mean all of us?
Orjust us?

40:41.440 --> 40:44.022
I was thinking
just the two of us.

40:45.736 --> 40:46.942
Did Taub
put you up to this?

40:47.029 --> 40:48.144
No.

40:48.238 --> 40:50.650
It was just something
I'd been thinking about
and I figured,

40:50.741 --> 40:53.357
"What the heck?
Might as well ask."

40:55.287 --> 40:57.903
Yeah, well,
it's probably
not a good idea,

40:57.998 --> 41:00.205
you know, with us
working together.

41:01.043 --> 41:04.331
Didn't you marry someone
you used to work with?

41:04.421 --> 41:06.207
Yeah, but...

41:08.550 --> 41:11.212
All right, sure.
VVhen?

Tonight?
Sure.

Okay.

changed your mind.
