00:47.589 --> 00:49.924
FLEXIBILITY.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.635
- TATTOOING IN A PRISON
WITH A SINGLE NEEDLE?

00:52.719 --> 00:53.803
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.597

01:09.861 --> 01:10.945
OR THERE'S NO REASON
OF ME DOING THE PIECE.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.823
[bleep] I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.200
I'VE NEVER HAD A CLIENT
DO THIS TO ME BEFORE.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.284

ON NATIONAL TELEVISION BEFORE.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.462
LET'S FIND OUT

04:14.545 --> 04:18.548
THE TWO ARTISTS WHO YOU THINK

04:34.274 --> 04:35.274
YEAH.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.867
THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN
SIX HOURS TO TATTOO

04:44.951 --> 04:46.286
THE DESIGN AND THE STYLE
OF THEIR CHOICE.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.706
THEY'VE BEEN TATTOOING
FOR OVER FIVE HOURS

04:49.789 --> 04:51.457
AND NOW HAVE
A LITTLE UNDER AN HOUR TO GO.

04:51.541 --> 04:55.503
AMERICA, YOU WILL HAVE THE FINAL
SAY ON WHO WINS THIS BATTLE.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.881
{\an8}ALL NIGHT LONG, YOU CAN WATCH

{\an8}AND BASED ON THEIR WORK,

05:09.308 --> 05:12.895
{\an8}AND TWEET YOUR VOTES

KYLE ALMOST MADE IT

05:15.148 --> 05:20.695
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT HOW HE GOT HERE.

05:20.778 --> 05:21.863
- I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN THIS.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.239
{\an8}I NEED $100,000.

05:23.322 --> 05:26.743
I'VE BEEN DOING GOOD TATTOOS
FOR SIX YEARS,

05:26.826 --> 05:28.494
AND [bleep] BEFORE IT.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.165
- YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW,
SO CALM YOUR ASS DOWN.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.167
- I'VE HAD THE WORST CANVASES
IN EVERY SITUATION.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.961
THIS ISN'T GONNA WIN
THIS CHALLENGE.

05:37.045 --> 05:37.879
- UNLESS YOU'RE SHARING
THE 100 GRAND,

05:37.962 --> 05:39.464
I GOTTA MAKE SURE
THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.590
- THE ONLY THING THAT EVEN
KEEPS ME HERE RIGHT NOW

05:40.673 --> 05:43.301
IS THE BITTER TASTE OF POSSIBLY
GOING HOME BEFORE YOU

05:43.384 --> 05:46.429
AND LEAVING YOU
TO BECOME INK MASTER.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.598
- THE SMOOTH GRAY SHADING
IS REALLY NICE.

05:48.681 --> 05:52.185
- THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL THAT
YOU PUT INTO THIS IS FANTASTIC.

05:52.268 --> 05:56.022
- IF I WANT TO MAKE IT TO
THE FINALE, I HAVE TO DROP JAWS.

05:56.105 --> 05:59.734
- TODAY, YOU NEEDED TO DO
SOMETHING THAT WAS CLEAR.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.778
YOU MADE
SOME AWKWARD DECISIONS

06:01.861 --> 06:03.071
AND WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.324
- KYLE, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

06:08.451 --> 06:12.371
[cheers and applause]

06:12.455 --> 06:13.623
RIGHT ON.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.459
KYLE, GOOD TO SEE YOU, BROTHER.
- HOW YOU DOING, SIR?

06:16.542 --> 06:18.211
- HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

06:18.294 --> 06:21.672
SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE TATTOO YOU'RE DOING NOW.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.050
- A LITTLE BIT OF REDEMPTION,
I HOPE.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.051
{\an8}IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING
THAT I RUN A LOT,

06:25.134 --> 06:27.387
{\an8}IS DEATH AND BEAUTY...
- OKAY.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.639
{\an8}- AND HOPEFULLY THIS ONE
IS MORE CONCISE

06:29.722 --> 06:31.599
{\an8}AND NOT AS BEFUDDLED
AS MAYBE MY LAST ONE.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.059
- RIGHT ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.268
- YOU TOO, AS WELL.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.063
- LET'S MOVE OVER TO CHRIS.
[applause]

06:37.146 --> 06:38.439
CHRIS?
- WHAT'S UP?

06:38.523 --> 06:39.649
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.
- YEAH, MAN.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.025
- HOW YOU BEEN?
- AWESOME.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.820
- GOOD. TELL US A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THIS DESIGN.

06:43.903 --> 06:44.821
- I PICKED A LITTLE MONGOOSE.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.656
HE'S LIKE NATURE'S LITTLE
UNDERDOG, YOU KNOW?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.116
- MM-HMM.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.992
- AND I JUST WANTED TO DO
A TATTOO THAT LOOKED COOL.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.161
{\an8}SO I DON'T CARE, LIKE,
ANY MEANING BEHIND IT.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.412
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO DO
SOMETHING BADASS

06:53.496 --> 06:56.249
{\an8}'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE I NEVER
REALLY GOT TO SHOW IT

06:56.332 --> 06:58.084
{\an8}WHEN I WAS ON THERE,
YOU KNOW, AND YEAH.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.628
- RIGHT ON, MAN.
GOOD LUCK.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.170
- THANK YOU.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.756
- GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.509
[cheers and applause]

07:06.592 --> 07:11.597
- LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT HOW CHRIS GOT HERE.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.473
- CHRIS.
- HI, THERE.

07:12.557 --> 07:16.018
I LIKE TATTOOS
WITH MEAT ON THEIR BONES.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.520
REALLY VISUALLY AGGRESSIVE.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.312
{\an8}I BUILT A REPUTATION
FOR BEING THE GUY YOU GO TO

07:18.396 --> 07:20.481
{\an8}IF YOU WANT IT DONE RIGHT.
- CHRIS.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.359
- HOW MANY PEOPLE
WOULD SAY THAT'S A KOALA BEAR?

07:23.442 --> 07:25.236
- TATTOO'S DEFINITELY
THE ROUGHEST ONE WE'VE SEEN.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.529
YOU REALLY NEED
TO STEP YOUR GAME UP.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.072
- I CAN'T GET MY HEAD
OUT OF MY ASS.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.448
I SHOULD BE
THROTTLING SOME FOOLS.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.784
I'M JUST CHOKING,
BUT I REALLY CARE,

07:31.868 --> 07:33.828
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M [bleep]
ON SOMETHING THAT I CARE ABOUT.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.830
- THE BROWN DOES HAVE
A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO LIGHT,

07:35.913 --> 07:37.373
AND THAT'S GOOD.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.541
OH, YAY! FINALLY.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.668
HOPEFULLY IT'S THE START
OF A NEW BEGINNING.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.336
- YOU KIND OF
SCREWED YOURSELF IN THIS.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.463
IF WE WERE HAVING
A "TATTOO THAT NOBODY CAN TELL

07:44.547 --> 07:46.340
WHAT IT WAS" DAY,
YOU WOULD WIN.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.551
- IT'S LIKE I'M DEFEATING
MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

07:48.634 --> 07:51.721
- CHRIS, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.723
- I AM BETTER
THAN WHAT I EXHIBIT HERE.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.266
IT'S BULL[bleep].

07:55.349 --> 07:58.519
[cheers and applause]

08:06.611 --> 08:07.778
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.573
YOU HAVE ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR
LEFT, ALL RIGHT?

08:10.656 --> 08:12.325
OKAY, AMERICA.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.702

THEY LEARNED THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO <i> INK MASTER,</i>

08:36.015 --> 08:38.934
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ERROR.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.942
FRANK MCMANUS.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.689
CRAIG FOSTER.

09:24.772 --> 09:29.652
[cheers and applause]

09:29.735 --> 09:33.406
JACKIE JENNINGS.

[cheers and applause]

09:36.742 --> 09:41.455
JASON CLAY DUNN.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.834
[cheers and applause]

09:44.917 --> 09:47.378
JOSHUA HIBBARD.

09:47.461 --> 09:53.301
[cheers and applause,
scattered booing]

09:53.384 --> 09:54.927
WOW.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.304
NOW...
- WHOA!

09:56.387 --> 09:59.598
- LET'S BRING OUT
OUR THREE FINALISTS.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.645
JIME LITWALK.

10:04.729 --> 10:09.567
[cheers and applause]

10:11.319 --> 10:13.612
TATU BABY.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.658
[cheers and applause]

10:21.871 --> 10:25.374
JOEY HAMILTON.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.336
[cheers and applause]

10:31.047 --> 10:35.301
RIGHT ON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.635
REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.222
MADDIE, YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF A RADIANT GLOW?

10:40.306 --> 10:41.182
I--

10:41.265 --> 10:42.058
- I DON'T KNOW.
[laughs]

10:42.141 --> 10:43.476
- I CAN'T SEEM
TO PUT MY FINGER ON IT.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.227
WHAT'S CHANGED WITH YOU?

10:45.311 --> 10:48.356
{\an8}- UH, WELL, I'M STILL CRYING,
AND--YEAH.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.649
I WENT HOME,
FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT,

10:50.733 --> 10:53.277
AND I'M ACTUALLY DUE
NEXT WEEK, SO...

10:53.361 --> 10:57.239
- WOW.
[cheers and applause]

11:00.326 --> 11:02.745
NOW, WOULD YOU TELL THOSE OF US
THAT ARE WATCHING

11:02.828 --> 11:06.540
AND THE PEOPLE AT HOME
HOW EXACTLY THAT HAPPENED?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.167
[laughter]
- I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.127
[laughs]
- ALL RIGHT.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.003
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.380
- THANK YOU.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.090
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DIVE RIGHT INTO THIS.

11:14.173 --> 11:18.594
ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL
TOPICS THIS SEASON WAS STRATEGY.

11:18.677 --> 11:22.139
JOSHUA, FROM THE BEGINNING,
YOU EMBRACED BEING CALLED

11:22.223 --> 11:24.266
THE INSTIGATOR BECAUSE
OF THE WAY YOU COMPETED.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.602
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.270
{\an8}- WELL, I CAME
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON,

11:28.354 --> 11:31.607
{\an8}3,000 MILES AWAY FROM MY FAMILY
TO GET THIS MONEY FOR MY FAMILY,

11:31.690 --> 11:33.818
{\an8}AND I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I'M GONNA PLAY IT SAFE.

11:33.901 --> 11:37.279
IN FACT, I WAS SO HONEST
WITH EVERYBODY IN EXACTLY

11:37.363 --> 11:39.990
HOW I WAS GONNA USE ALL
THE DYNAMICS OF THIS COMPETITION

11:40.074 --> 11:41.283
TO WIN THIS MONEY
FOR MY FAMILY,

11:41.367 --> 11:44.787
AND WHEN I DID THAT, EVERYBODY
ACTED LIKE I WAS TRICKING THEM.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.455
- WOW.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.457
YOU BECAME KIND OF A HOT TOPIC
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.128
{\an8}SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED YOU,
BUT SOME PEOPLE SUPPORTED YOU,

11:52.211 --> 11:56.006
{\an8}LIKE ROY, WHO TWEETED, "I DON'T
GET WHY EVERYONE HATES JOSH.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.843
{\an8}"HE'S A PLAYER OF THE GAME.
HE'S UP FRONT ABOUT IT.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.053
{\an8}"IF ANYTHING,
HE SHOULD BE LIKED.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.764
{\an8}JIME IS THE ONE
WHO'S OUT OF LINE."

12:03.848 --> 12:06.142
[laughter]

12:06.225 --> 12:08.644
JIME, ANY COMMENTS?
- NAH.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.438
AS SOON AS JOSH CAME
TO THE HOUSE, HE ACTED LIKE

12:10.521 --> 12:11.313
HE WAS PERSECUTED
BY EVERYBODY.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.524
HE CAME IN PLAYING HIS GAME,

12:13.607 --> 12:14.942
THINKING HE WAS BETTER
THAN EVERYBODY.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.485
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT,
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE CHOPS.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.153
THE GUY COULDN'T EVEN DRAW.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.489
- WOW.
all: OOH.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.868
[scattered applause]
- THAT'S--

12:23.951 --> 12:26.162
THAT HAS BEEN SAID
A NUMBER OF TIMES.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.164
HOW DO YOU RESPOND
TO THAT, JOSHUA?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.123
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

12:29.206 --> 12:31.167
DIFFERENT ARTISTS
DO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ART,

12:31.250 --> 12:32.042
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE NOT AN ARTIST.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.878
AND JUST BECAUSE
I DON'T DRAW GOOGLY-EYED,

12:33.961 --> 12:35.421
BUBBLY GIRLS EVERY TIME
I PUT PENCIL TO PAPER...

12:35.504 --> 12:36.505
[scattered cheers]

12:36.589 --> 12:37.756
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I CAN'T DRAW.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.633
IN FACT, IF HE WERE
TO TRY TO DO WHAT I DO,

12:39.717 --> 12:42.011
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT HE COULD DO THAT,

12:42.094 --> 12:44.346
AND HIS JEALOUSY BECAUSE
OF THAT, AND THE INTIMIDATION,

12:44.430 --> 12:46.182
WAS WHY HE BULLIED ME
THE ENTIRE TIME.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.434
- PFFT.
- WOW.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.061
- [laughs]

12:51.145 --> 12:52.313
- THAT'S A MOUTHFUL.

12:52.396 --> 12:57.902
- IT LOOKS LIKE JIME BULLIED HIS
WAY INTO THE FINAL THREE, RIGHT?

13:04.283 --> 13:07.870
ALLY, CARE TO ADD ANYTHING?

13:07.953 --> 13:08.996
- YEAH.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.539
YOU KNOW, I DEFINITELY THINK
THAT HE PLAYED THE GAME.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.043
{\an8}I MEAN, AS FAR AS HOW
HE DEALT WITH, YOU KNOW,

13:14.126 --> 13:16.128
{\an8}PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY,
THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE,

13:16.212 --> 13:20.883
{\an8}BUT I FEEL THAT HE CAME HERE,
AND BECAUSE HE DID NOT GIVE JIME

13:20.966 --> 13:23.385
{\an8}THE TATTOO THAT JIME
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO DO--

13:23.469 --> 13:25.804
{\an8}I MEAN, THIS IS A COMPETITION
FOR 100 GRAND.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.140
I MEAN,
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS AFTERWARDS,

13:28.224 --> 13:29.391
BUT I MEAN, THIS IS HERE--
THIS IS A COMPETITION.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.559
HE'S HERE TO WIN.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.228
HE DIDN'T GIVE EVERYONE
THE TATTOO

13:32.311 --> 13:33.979
THEY THOUGHT
THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD,

13:34.063 --> 13:36.190
AND MAYBE IF I PLAYED THE GAME
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY,

13:36.273 --> 13:37.566
I WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
LONGER TOO.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.901
- OKAY.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.861
ES, ANYTHING TO ADD?
- NAH, IT'S LIKE THIS--

13:40.945 --> 13:44.114
[cheers and applause]

13:46.825 --> 13:47.785
- LET'S HEAR FROM ES.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.869
- YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME
HOWEVER YOU WANT.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.037
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.330
YOU GOT YOUR STRATEGY,
FINE, THAT'S ALL THERE.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.081
- [laughs]
- BUT THE THING IS LIKE THIS.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.959
{\an8}IF YOU'RE GONNA DO
FLIP-FLOPPING,

13:55.042 --> 13:56.961
{\an8}ONE DAY YOU'RE THIS PERSON'S
FRIEND, THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE NOT,

13:57.044 --> 14:00.089
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO RESPECT YOU?

14:00.172 --> 14:03.259
{\an8}HOW DO EXPECT ME
TO RESPECT YOU AS A MAN

14:03.342 --> 14:04.969
{\an8}IF YOU'RE DOING
THIS FLIP-FLOP BUSINESS?

14:05.052 --> 14:06.845
AFTER THIS, YOU KNOW,
SHOW'S ALL SAID AND DONE,

14:06.929 --> 14:09.265
I MEAN, WHO'S GONNA BE
YOUR HOMEBOY OUT THERE?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.432
EVERYBODY WANTS
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.809
- LET ME TELL YOU--
- STRAIGHT-UP, MAN.

14:11.892 --> 14:12.726
- WHOA!

14:12.810 --> 14:14.436
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- WHOA!

14:14.520 --> 14:15.980
[cheers and applause]

14:16.063 --> 14:16.689
- I WANTED TO.
I REALLY WANTED

14:16.772 --> 14:19.066
- KNOW WHAT?
LET ME TELL YOU.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.318
I CAME HERE TO KEEP
RESPECT FOR MY FAMILY,

14:21.402 --> 14:23.571
AND I STILL HAVE THE RESPECT
FROM MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS

14:23.654 --> 14:25.573
'CAUSE THEY KNOW WHO I AM
AND THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.450
{\an1}- BUT YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FROM
ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.078
- ALL RIGHT. FAIR ENOUGH.
LET'S MOVE IT ALONG HERE.

14:31.161 --> 14:35.708
JIME, YOU MADE IT TO THE END.
WHAT EXACTLY WAS YOUR STRATEGY?

14:35.791 --> 14:37.793
{\an8}- MY STRATEGY WAS TO COME HERE

14:37.876 --> 14:39.962
{\an8}AND DO THIS COMPETITION
WITH INTEGRITY.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.299
{\an8}I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW,
SHOWCASE MYSELF AS AN ARTIST,

14:43.382 --> 14:44.550
{\an8}AND I WANTED
EVERYONE ELSE TO COMPETE

14:44.633 --> 14:45.968
{\an8}AT THEIR HIGHEST FORM OF ART

14:46.051 --> 14:48.887
{\an8}AND JUST TO SHOW AMERICA WHAT
GOOD TATTOOS SHOULD BE ABOUT.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.055
- RIGHT ON.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.100
[cheers and applause]

14:56.353 --> 14:58.814
HEY, KYLE?

14:58.897 --> 15:02.735
I KNOW YOU'RE TATTOOING, BUT DO
YOU CARE TO CHIME IN ON THIS?

15:02.818 --> 15:03.444
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.654
- YOU DON'T HAVE TIME,
DO YOU?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.364
[laughter]
- I'M RIGHT AGAINST THE WALL.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.616
- KYLE, YOU BETTER
GET BACK TO WORK.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.161
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.495
[laughter]

15:13.579 --> 15:16.749
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.001
CHRIS, OLIVER, I'M CURIOUS
TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.630
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT STRATEGY
IN A GAME LIKE THIS?

15:22.713 --> 15:25.341
- I THINK THE WEAKEST ARTIST
BARKED THE LOUDEST.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.010
- WOW.
- THAT'S MY OPINION.

15:28.093 --> 15:33.098
[audience oohs
and applauds]

15:33.182 --> 15:35.392
- OLLIE?

15:35.476 --> 15:36.977
- I THINK THAT COMING
INTO THIS COMPETITION

15:37.061 --> 15:38.228
CAN DEFINITELY
BE STRESSFUL.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.104
{\an8}AND YOU WANT TO COME
IN HERE WITH A GAME PLAN,

15:39.188 --> 15:39.980
{\an8}AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GONNA

15:40.064 --> 15:43.692
{\an8}COMPETE ON YOUR BEST
THAT YOU CAN GIVE.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.152
SO HAVING SOME SORT
OF STRATEGY

15:45.235 --> 15:46.862
TO KEEP YOUR HEAD
IN THE GAME IS GOOD,

15:46.945 --> 15:49.573
BUT, JOSH,
ANY TIME YOU MAKE ENEMIES,

15:49.657 --> 15:53.661
IT'S GONNA HAUNT YOU DOWN
THE LINE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.203
[laughter]

15:54.286 --> 15:56.747
- FOREVER.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.792
- YEAH.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.752
ALL RIGHT.
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.171
JASON, LET'S MOVE IT ALONG.
- BOO!

16:04.254 --> 16:07.966
- YOU UPSET A LOT OF ARTISTS
WHEN YOU HANDED OUT THE SKULLS.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.094
DO YOU REGRET THE WAY
YOU PLAYED THIS GAME?

16:10.177 --> 16:11.387
{\an8}- HELL, NO, MAN,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:11.470 --> 16:14.306
{\an8}I--IT'S TIME--DURING THAT TIME
OF THE COMPETITION, IT WAS TIME

16:14.390 --> 16:17.184
{\an8}FOR THEM TO FEEL SOME OF THE
PAIN SOME OF THE OTHER ARTISTS

16:17.267 --> 16:20.229
{\an8}AND MYSELF WERE GOING THROUGH
AT THAT TIME IN THE COMPETITION.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.731
I MEAN, I WANTED SOME OF
THE TOP GUYS, LIKE JOEY AND JIME

16:22.815 --> 16:25.901
AND THEM TO FEEL WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE SO THAT THEY CAN

16:25.984 --> 16:28.779
GET THAT UNDER THEIR BELT,
AND IT CHANGES UP EVERYTHING.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.905
I WAS JUST DOING THAT
OUT OF FUN, MAN.

16:29.988 --> 16:33.075
NOT MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR
LIKE, UH, YOU KNOW.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.452
I WAS STIRRING THE POT
FOR FUN.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.246
THESE--AND NO MATTER
WHAT I GAVE THESE GUYS,

16:37.329 --> 16:40.999
IT WAS ALL A DIFFICULT TATTOO,
AND I GOT TO CHOOSE THE SKULLS.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.751
I DIDN'T HAVE NO PLAN.
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.964
WELL, WE NEED TO MOVE THIS THING
ALONG, AND IT'S CLEAR,

16:47.047 --> 16:49.925
LIKE SO MANY GREAT ARTISTS,
YOU'RE ALL VERY PASSIONATE.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.052
UP NEXT, THE HUMAN CANVASES.

16:52.136 --> 16:56.306
EACH WEEK THEY PUT
THEIR SKIN ON THE LINE.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.852
MOST LEFT THRILLED,
BUT SOME OF 'EM LEFT PISSED.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.521
WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM NEXT.
DON'T GO AWAY.

17:02.604 --> 17:06.942
[cheers and applause]

17:28.505 --> 17:32.217
[cheers and applause]

17:37.431 --> 17:40.934
- WELCOME BACK
TO <i> INK MASTER LIVE.</i>

17:41.018 --> 17:43.937

KYLE AND CHRIS ARE TATTOOING

17:44.021 --> 17:47.274

{\an8}LET'S SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.246
{\an8}KYLE?
- SIR.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.790
{\an8}- IF YOU'RE VOTED BACK,

18:02.873 --> 18:06.376
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
DO DIFFERENTLY NEXT SEASON?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.003
{\an8}- I'M GONNA
KEEP THINGS SIMPLE.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.464
{\an8}SIMPLE AS PIE--
I SEEM TO MESS UP A LOT

18:10.547 --> 18:11.673
{\an8}BY OVERTHINKING
EVERYTHING, SO...

18:11.757 --> 18:14.551
- OKAY.
- JUST THAT.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.011
- GOOD PLAN. GOOD PLAN.
[laughter]

18:16.095 --> 18:20.015
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO CHECK IN
WITH CHRIS OVER HERE.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.016
WHAT'S UP, CHRIS?
- HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?

18:21.099 --> 18:23.519
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- YES, SIR.

18:23.602 --> 18:27.231
- SO KYLE MADE IT PRETTY FAR
LAST SEASON.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.358
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOU CAN BEAT HIM?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.360
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM,
HE'S CONTENDING

18:31.443 --> 18:33.946
WITH THE PERSON
WHO I NORMALLY AM NOW.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.155
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.198
HE GOT LUCKY.

18:36.281 --> 18:36.949
{\an8}- YOU DID MENTION
THAT YOU WEREN'T REALLY

18:37.032 --> 18:38.075
{\an8}IN THE ZONE
DURING THE SEASON.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.078
{\an8}- OH, GOSH, NO.
- ARE YOU BACK IN YOUR ZONE?

18:41.161 --> 18:42.287
{\an8}- OH, WITHOUT A DOUBT.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.205
I MEAN, ONCE YOU REALIZE--
IT'S LIKE,

18:43.288 --> 18:46.667
I PUT TOO MUCH EMOTION
INTO SOMETHING THAT,

18:46.750 --> 18:48.335
YOU KNOW--IT'S A GAME.
IT'S TV, YOU KNOW?

18:48.418 --> 18:49.461
IT'S LIKE,
HAVE FUN WITH IT.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.046
DON'T TAKE EVERYTHING
SO SERIOUSLY...

18:51.129 --> 18:52.130
- OKAY.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.549
- AND PUT THE WHOLE WORLD
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.591
WE'RE JUST DRAWING PICTURES,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:54.675 --> 18:57.302
- SO WE HAVE SIMPLE,
AND DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

18:57.386 --> 18:57.970
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- I LIKE IT.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.055
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
GOOD LUCK.

19:00.138 --> 19:03.016
BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE
ABOUT 20 MINUTES LEFT.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.978
[applause]

19:06.061 --> 19:08.480
THIS SEASON,
IN A MAJOR TWIST,

19:08.564 --> 19:11.733
<i>INK MASTER</i> GAVE
THE HUMAN CANVASES A VOICE.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.902
EACH WEEK,
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

19:13.986 --> 19:16.613
VOTED ON THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THE WORST

19:16.697 --> 19:19.199
AND PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.993
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PEOPLE

19:21.076 --> 19:24.621
WHO PUT THEIR SKIN ON THE LINE
FOR THIS COMPETITION.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.081
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:26.164 --> 19:29.501
YOU WILL BE PERMANENTLY
INKING HUMAN CANVASES.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.586
- I'M GONNA GET
THE ROMAN COLOSSEUM ON MY BACK.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.921
- HOLY [bleep].

19:33.005 --> 19:35.465
- I WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE A LION
HAS RIPPED OFF MY BUTT CHEEK.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.509
{\an8}- NOW, WHAT?

19:37.593 --> 19:38.093
- [yells]

19:38.176 --> 19:40.679
- [winces]
- [groans]

19:40.762 --> 19:43.098
- ONCE WE FINISH THIS LINE WORK,
IT'S ALL A BREEZE FROM THERE.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.851
- WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO GET THIS
IN YOUR ARMPIT?

19:45.934 --> 19:46.810
- [groans]

19:46.894 --> 19:49.229
- CAN'T BELIEVE THE WORK
THAT GOES INTO THIS.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.355
- YOU MAKE SURE
YOU TELL HIM

19:50.439 --> 19:50.772
IF HE'S DOING
SOMETHING WRONG.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.107
{\an8}- I AM LIVID.

19:52.190 --> 19:55.027
MYSTICAL MIKE [bleep] UP
MY TATTOO.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.653
THE POINT IS FOR ME
TO WALK AWAY

19:56.737 --> 19:57.487
WITH SOMETHING
THAT I'M HAPPY WITH.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.115
- THIS SEASON,
IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT

20:00.198 --> 20:01.825
TO MAKE
YOUR HUMAN CANVAS HAPPY.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.536
THERE WILL BE
A HUMAN CANVAS JURY.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.915
{\an8}- IF YOU DON'T PLEASE
YOUR CANVAS, YOU COULD GO HOME.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.666
- DOES ANYONE FEEL THAT MADDIE'S
TATTOO SHOULD BE ON THE BOTTOM?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.002
- SHE HURT ME, BRO.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.879
MY [bleep]
IS SCREAMING ON FIRE.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.423
- TO ME, IT LOOKS LIKE
A SCREAMING VAGINA.

20:16.506 --> 20:17.799
[laughter]

20:17.883 --> 20:20.218
- THIS TATTOO IS A LADY
GETTING OFF, HAVING AN INK-GASM.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.803
- LOOKS LIKE A LADY
TAKING A [bleep].

20:21.887 --> 20:23.555
- THIS IS
THE WORST ONE BY FAR.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.932
- THE WORST?

20:25.015 --> 20:26.475
- I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE
HE TOOK A CARTOON STENCIL

20:26.558 --> 20:27.809
AND THREW IT ON YOUR ASS.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.061
- HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE
I CAN PEE MORE COLORS

20:29.144 --> 20:30.395
THAN THAT TATTOO HAS.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.648
- I DON'T THINK IT CAPTURES
PHOTOREALISM AS MUCH.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.149
- HAVE YOU SEEN THE MONUMENT?
- I HAVE NOT.

20:34.232 --> 20:35.817
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW THE MONUMENT?
- I DON'T KNOW THE MONUMENT.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.777
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.111
- TO ME IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE

20:38.195 --> 20:41.823
LEATHERFACE FROM
<i>TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.</i>

20:41.907 --> 20:43.742
- THAT'S IT. MACHINES DOWN.
- WHOO-HOO!

20:43.825 --> 20:44.910
- NO MORE INK!
- YES!

20:44.993 --> 20:46.745
- NICE!
OFF THE HOOK, HON.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.664
- YOU LIKE IT?
- BEAUTIFUL.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.082
- OH, MY GOD.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.959
IT'S GORGEOUS.
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.086
CAN I HUG YOU, PLEASE?
- OF COURSE.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.422
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAN.
- YOU GET A HUG TOO.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.216
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:59.299 --> 21:03.178
[cheers and applause]

21:03.261 --> 21:07.099
- JOINING US IN THE AUDIENCE
TONIGHT ARE THE HUMAN CANVASES.

21:07.182 --> 21:10.185
LET'S TALK TO A FEW OF THEM.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.938
JEN, JOHN, COME ON UP.

21:13.021 --> 21:17.859
[applause]

21:17.943 --> 21:20.988
JOHN,
ALLY WAS YOUR ARTIST,

21:21.071 --> 21:22.906
AND SHE TATTOOED
THE CELTIC CROSS.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.533
YOU BROUGHT YOUR GIRLFRIEND HERE
WITH YOU, JEN, TONIGHT.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.952
- YUP.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.453
- JEN, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE TATTOO?

21:28.537 --> 21:30.706
- I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.
- WOW.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.374
- I AM NOT HAPPY
WITH THE FLAMES.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.918
FLAMES ARE NOT ROUND
OR UNIFORM.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.379
THE 13s COULD HAVE BEEN
HIGHLIGHTED BETTER,

21:37.462 --> 21:38.964
AND SHE BLAMED HIM
FOR EVERYTHING.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.300
- WOW. ALLY?

21:42.384 --> 21:43.927
- YOU KNOW
WHAT'S FUNNY TO ME,

21:44.011 --> 21:47.014
IS THAT YOU WERE NEXT DOOR
GETTING TATTOOED

21:47.097 --> 21:50.976
BY ES, AND YOU WERE THERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.185
- AND I DIDN'T GET TO GET UP
ONCE AND TAKE A LOOK.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.230
- YEAH.
YOU SAW THE STENCIL.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.065
{\an8}WE PLACED IT, AND YOU
CHECKED IT OUT BECAUSE WE--

21:57.149 --> 21:59.026
{\an8}WE DOUBLE-CHECKED FOR PLACEMENT
TO MAKE SURE IT WAS PERFECT,

21:59.109 --> 22:02.070
{\an8}AND WE DISCUSSED EXECUTION.

22:02.154 --> 22:07.034
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED,
AND HE LOVED IT.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.162
LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.788
- I DIDN'T WANT BLOW-OUTS
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, THOUGH.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.664
- JOHN, YOU DID LOVE IT.
all: OOH.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.999
- YOU DID LOVE IT.
- I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.251
WHAT WAS THAT?
- HE LOVED IT.

22:16.334 --> 22:18.253
- I LOVED THE CONCEPT
THAT YOU CAME UP WITH,

22:18.336 --> 22:21.465
'CAUSE I WANTED THE 13s
INITIALLY IN THE CROSS, BUT--

22:21.548 --> 22:22.924
- RIGHT.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.844
- SO WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT
WANTING THE 13s "IN THE CROSS,"

22:25.927 --> 22:28.096
WHAT WE DISCUSSED
WAS THAT THE WHOLE POINT

22:28.180 --> 22:30.640
OF KNOT WORK
IS THAT IT CONNECTS.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.018
WHEN YOU PUT TWO 13s
INSIDE THE CROSS,

22:33.101 --> 22:35.187
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY CAN CONNECT,

22:35.270 --> 22:38.273
SO IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION,
I GAVE YOU OPTIONS.

22:38.356 --> 22:42.277
ONE OF THEM WAS TO NOT DO
HOT ROD FLAMES BUT TO DO A FULL,

22:42.360 --> 22:46.490
YOU KNOW, KIND OF FLOW
OF FLAME-LOOKING BACKGROUND

22:46.573 --> 22:48.950
WITH SOME
NEGATIVE SPACE 13s.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.827
I GAVE YOU
A, B, AND C OPTIONS.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.955
YOU CHOSE C, AND NOW
YOUR LADY'S UPSET ABOUT IT?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.665
- YOU CAN BARELY SEE THE 13s.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.751
- THE 13s DON'T STAND OUT.
YOU--

22:57.834 --> 23:00.921
- YOU DID NOT WANT THEM
TO COMPETE WITH THE FOREGROUND.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.131
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE THERE'S--

23:03.215 --> 23:04.299
- FROM DAY ONE,
IT WAS EXPRESSED

23:04.382 --> 23:06.885
THAT IT WAS A TRIBUTE
TO MY BROTHER.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.553
IT WAS A MEMORIAL PIECE.
- ALL RIGHT, JOHN.

23:08.637 --> 23:09.221
PERHAPS WE'LL SEE YOU
NEXT SEASON

23:09.304 --> 23:11.306
FOR THE COVER-UP
CHALLENGE.

23:11.389 --> 23:12.474
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.475
- ALL RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.310
- SEE YOU LATER.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.729
[applause]

23:17.813 --> 23:19.981
SOMETIMES CANVASES
STRONGLY DISAGREE

23:20.065 --> 23:23.026
WITH WHAT THE JUDGES
HAD TO SAY.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.861
MARISOL, HOW ARE YOU?

23:24.945 --> 23:26.655
- HELLO.
- NICE TO SEE YOU.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.031
JOSHUA GAVE YOU
A LANDMARK TATTOO.

23:28.115 --> 23:28.865
- YES, HE DID.
- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

23:28.949 --> 23:31.118
- I LOVE MY TATTOO.

23:31.201 --> 23:35.080
I HONESTLY WISH HE HAD
ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE IT,

23:35.163 --> 23:38.667
BUT I LOVE WHAT I GOT,
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

23:38.750 --> 23:41.044
I'M WEARING THIS FOREVER.
NO ONE ELSE IS.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.004
- WERE YOU UPSET
WITH THE JUDGES' COMMENTARY ON--

23:43.088 --> 23:44.131
WHEN IT CAME DOWN
TO JUDGING THAT TATTOO?

23:44.214 --> 23:47.926
- YEAH, BECAUSE I THINK
THERE WERE TATTOOS

23:48.009 --> 23:51.388
THAT WERE WORSE THAN MINE
AND WERE OBVIOUSLY CHOSEN

23:51.471 --> 23:54.182
BY THE JURY TO BE
AT THE BOTTOM FOR A REASON,

23:54.266 --> 23:56.476
BUT MINE GOT THE WORST OF IT.
THE LINE WORK WAS GREAT.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.854
DIDN'T SHOW
THAT MUCH DIMENSION

23:58.937 --> 24:00.772
BUT BETTER THAN
A CARTOON CHARACTER WAS--

24:00.856 --> 24:02.357
THAT WAS PUT
ON SOMEONE ELSE.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.400
- WELL, LET'S HEAR
FROM THE JUDGES.

24:03.483 --> 24:04.693
OLIVER?
- YEAH, CORRECT.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.487
THERE WERE TATTOOS WORSE
THAN YOURS, AND THOSE PEOP--

24:07.571 --> 24:08.321
THAT PERSON WENT HOME
THAT DAY.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.032
JOSHUA DIDN'T GO HOME
FOR THIS TATTOO.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.993
OUR JOB IS TO CRITIQUE
THESE TATTOOS

24:13.076 --> 24:14.911
AND PICK OUT EVERYTHING
WE CAN NEGATIVE ABOUT 'EM

24:14.995 --> 24:16.454
SO THAT WE CAN LAY OUT
AND FIND OUT

24:16.538 --> 24:18.999
WHO IS THE STRONGEST
AND WHO IS THE WEAKEST.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.334
ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY,
JOSH WAS NOT THE WEAKEST.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.253
THE TATTOO IS
A GREAT TATTOO.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.589
WE'RE--AS JUDGES, WE'RE HAPPY
THAT YOU LOVE YOUR TATTOO,

24:25.672 --> 24:27.174
BUT THERE'S
STILL THINGS ABOUT IT

24:27.257 --> 24:28.592
THAT WEREN'T
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.595
- OH, THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS
ABOUT IT THAT WASN'T THE BEST,

24:31.678 --> 24:34.973
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M GONNA
STAND BY MY ARTIST AS A WHOLE.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.141
- OKAY.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.392
- I THINK HE EXECUTED IT
WHAT I WANTED.

24:37.475 --> 24:40.187
I'D RATHER...
[cheers and applause]

24:40.270 --> 24:42.731
HAVE GOTTEN
WHAT I WANTED, OKAY,

24:42.814 --> 24:47.319
AND BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH THAT
THAN ONE OF THE ARTISTS

24:47.402 --> 24:48.403
TRYING TO CHANGE MY MIND
AND GIVE ME SOMETHING

24:48.486 --> 24:50.822
THAT I WASN'T HAPPY WITH
AND GO HOME WITH IT.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.407
AT THE END--

24:52.490 --> 24:53.408
{\an1}- MARISOL, I HAVE TO INTERRUPT
HERE AND PASS IT ALONG TO CHRIS.

24:53.491 --> 24:54.284
- YEAH.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.577
- YOU KNOW,
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.579
IT DOESN'T HAVE
THE MOST AMAZING DETAIL.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.247
{\an8}THAT DAY, WE WERE LOOKING FOR--
- I SAID DIMENSION.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.415
{\an8}I NEVER SAID DETAIL.

25:00.498 --> 25:01.750
{\an8}- OKAY, WELL,
LET'S GO WITH DIMENSION.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.084
BUT LET'S GO BACK TO IT.
- WOW.

25:03.168 --> 25:06.296
- THAT DAY, WHAT WE WERE LOOKING
FOR, HE DID NOT MEET.

25:06.379 --> 25:09.299
AN OUTLINE DOES NOT CREATE
SOMETHING THAT'S IN HD.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.508
- OKAY.
- SO BEFORE YOU GET

25:10.592 --> 25:12.510
YOUR FIVE SECONDS OF FAME,
UNDERSTAND--

25:12.594 --> 25:13.637
- THERE'S NOT--
- WHOA!

25:13.720 --> 25:15.513
- WE'RE NOT LOOKING--

25:15.597 --> 25:18.934
- I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
THE FIVE SECONDS OF FAME.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.185
- NOW, NOW.
- I ALREADY GOT THAT.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.478
- I HAVE THIS SEAT
FOR A REASON.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.147
WE'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.398
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR WHAT HE'S DOING.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.733
- OKAY.
- AND THAT'S WHERE WE STAY.

25:26.816 --> 25:31.529
- AND, AGAIN, THAT'S WHY
HE STILL STOOD ON THAT EPISODE

25:31.613 --> 25:33.949
AND OTHER ARTISTS WENT HOME.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.158
- MARISOL,
I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE

25:35.242 --> 25:35.867
IS YOU LOVE IT,
AND IT'S NOT ON THEM...

25:35.951 --> 25:36.618
- AND THAT'S ALL
THAT COUNTS.

25:36.701 --> 25:37.452
- SO THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS,
RIGHT?

25:37.535 --> 25:39.162
- THAT'S IT.
- ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.624
[cheers and applause]

25:42.707 --> 25:45.252
- AND THAT'S THAT.
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.379
- [laughs]
- LET'S HEAR FROM LYNN.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.838
HI, LYNN.

25:48.922 --> 25:49.756
KYLE WAS YOUR ARTIST,

25:49.839 --> 25:51.633
AND HE TATTOOED A PORTRAIT
OF YOUR MOTHER.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.635
- YES.
- TELL US ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.137
- WELL, ME AND MY MOM HAD A
GREAT TIME DOING THIS TOGETHER.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.138
I LOVE THE TATTOO.
KYLE DID IT.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.141
IT HEALED BEAUTIFULLY.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.603
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY, THERE WAS
A DOUCHE BAG IN THE AUDI--

26:03.687 --> 26:05.522
IN T ROOM CALLING MY MOTHER
A LEATHERFACE.

26:05.605 --> 26:09.401
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO CONFRONT HIM ON THIS,

26:09.484 --> 26:10.819
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO DO THAT NOW.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.362
- WELL, ALLEN, I THINK,
IS WHO SAID THAT.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.656
HE'S HERE.
LET'S HEAR FROM ALLEN.

26:14.739 --> 26:18.576
- YOU DISRESPECTED MY MOM,
AND YOU'RE A DICK.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.455
- WHOA!
[cheers and applause]

26:32.549 --> 26:35.093
- THAT'S MY MOM.
THAT'S MY MOTHER.

26:35.176 --> 26:40.015
SHE'S 85 YEARS OLD, AND YOU MADE
THE WORST COMMENT YOU CAN,

26:40.098 --> 26:43.768
AND I WANT TO KNOW
THE REASONING BEHIND IT.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.605
- WELL, CO--YOU--
[audience booing]

26:47.689 --> 26:50.025
- WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
- DON'T--YEAH, BOO.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.902
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL I DIDN'T CALL
YOUR MOTHER LEATHERFACE.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.238
I WAS CRITIQUING THE TATTOO.
NOT--

26:55.322 --> 26:57.032
- WHICH IS OF MY MOM.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.992
- IT WAS OF YOUR MOTHER,
BUT IT WASN'T TOWARDS YOUR MOM.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.328
IT WAS CRI--
A CRITIQUE ON THE TATTOO.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.620
NOT THE--NOT YOUR MOM.

27:02.704 --> 27:06.374
NOT THE PHOTOS TAKEN OF HER, SO
YOU'RE MAD AT THE WRONG PERSON.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.334
THE ONE YOU SHOULD MAD AT...
- HE DID BEAUTIFULLY!

27:07.417 --> 27:09.169
I GET COMMENTS
CONSTANTLY ON IT.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.629
KYLE DID A GREAT JOB.

27:11.713 --> 27:12.964
THAT WAS RIGHT OFF THE TABLE.
- GUYS, I GOT TO INTERRUPT.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.549
LYNN, LET ME INTERRUPT YOU
FOR A MINUTE.

27:14.632 --> 27:18.011
I THINK THAT I CAN PACIFY
THIS WHOLE THING HERE.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.347
IF HE SAID,
"IT LOOKS LIKE LEATHERFACE.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.806
IT'S PERFECT.
IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HER,"

27:21.890 --> 27:25.393
THEN--THEN HE WOULD
BE CRITIQUING YOUR MOM,

27:25.477 --> 27:26.519
BUT I THINK WHAT HE WAS SAYING

27:26.603 --> 27:28.897
IS, "IT DOESN'T LOOK
JUST LIKE HER MOM.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.067
IT LOOKS LIKE LEATHERFACE
ON THE TATTOO."

27:32.150 --> 27:33.943
SO I THINK IN ANY WAY...
[laughter]

27:34.027 --> 27:37.697
WHAT HE WAS SAYING--

27:37.781 --> 27:40.075
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

27:40.158 --> 27:40.617
- THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY
TO DESCRIBE IT.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.285
- SO WHAT HE WAS SAYING

27:42.369 --> 27:43.453
WAS YOUR MOM IS
MUCH MORE LOVELY IN PERSON.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.580
- BUT YOU REALIZE
YOU DISRESPECTED...

27:45.663 --> 27:47.999
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WE GOTTA MOVE IT ALONG.

27:48.083 --> 27:48.917
- A MOTHER, A GRANDMOTHER,
A GREAT GRANDMOTHER.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.418
DISRESPECTED HER.
- IT WASN'T DISRESPECT.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.629
- WOULD YOU DO THAT
TO YOUR MOTHER?

27:52.712 --> 27:55.048
- WAH, WAH, WAH.
- I WOULDN'T WANT THAT.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.007
- GUYS, WE GOTTA MOVE IT ALONG.
I'M SORRY.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.634
- I WOULD BE PISSED OFF
IF I WOULD'VE GOT--

27:57.717 --> 27:58.718
- ALLEN--

27:58.802 --> 27:59.719
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY
YOU'RE A DICK,

27:59.803 --> 28:01.012
AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE
AGREE WITH ME.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.764
- ALL RIGHT.
- GET OVER IT.

28:02.847 --> 28:03.515
- NEXT UP, EACH WEEK, AMERICA,

28:03.598 --> 28:06.851
YOU VOTED
FOR YOUR FAVORITE TATTOO.

28:06.935 --> 28:10.397
WE'LL FIND OUT THOSE RESULTS
WHEN <i> INK MASTER LIVE</i> RETURNS.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.275
STAY TUNED.

28:32.335 --> 28:36.589
[cheers and applause]

28:42.220 --> 28:44.806
- WELCOME BACK
TO <i> INK MASTER LIVE.</i>

28:44.889 --> 28:46.724
WITH JUST MINUTES LEFT
ON THE CLOCK,

28:46.808 --> 28:49.602
KYLE AND CHRIS ARE
FINISHING UP THEIR TATTOOS,

28:49.686 --> 28:52.647
COMPETING FOR A SPOT
ON SEASON FOUR OF <i> INK MASTER.</i>

28:52.730 --> 28:54.357
{\an8}AMERICA, TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.861
{\an8}GO TO INKMASTERLIVE.SPIKE.COM

28:57.944 --> 29:01.656
{\an8}TO VOTE FOR WHICH TATTOO
YOU THINK IS THE BEST.

29:01.739 --> 29:03.658
{\an8}NOW, IN ONE OF THE MOST
CONTROVERSIAL ELIMINATIONS

29:03.741 --> 29:07.662
{\an8}OF THE SEASON,
CRAIG WAS SENT HOME

29:07.745 --> 29:10.373
{\an8}FOR HIS BLACK-AND-GRAY PINUP.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.168
MANY FANS--
[scattered boos]

29:13.251 --> 29:15.545
MANY FANS WERE OUTRAGED.

29:15.628 --> 29:19.048
@ALLENKAILEY,
FOR INSTANCE, TWEETED,

29:19.132 --> 29:20.800
"EVERY TIME I SEE
CRAIG'S NAME

29:20.884 --> 29:22.594
"ON THE INTRODUCTION,
I GET PISSED ALL OVER AGAIN.

29:22.677 --> 29:26.181
{\an8}CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY SENT HIM HOME."

29:26.264 --> 29:30.894
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

29:35.023 --> 29:36.524
JOEY, YOU HAVE
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.109
- YEAH, DEFINITELY.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.986
I'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH ALLEN
THERE THAT I WAS OUTRAGED

29:40.069 --> 29:40.904
WHEN CRAIG DIDN'T
COME BACK UP INTO THE HOUSE.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.740
I THINK EVERYBODY
COULD SEE IT ON MY FACE.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.158
I THOUGHT HE WAS
A REALLY STRONG COMPETITOR,

29:45.241 --> 29:47.410
AND I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO COMPETING HIM--

29:47.494 --> 29:50.205
AGAINST HIM TO THE END, AND I
ALWAYS SAW HIM SITTING HERE

29:50.288 --> 29:52.248
WITH ME AND JIME
IN THE END.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.291
- WOW.
- [whistles]

29:53.374 --> 29:58.379
all: OOH!
[applause]

29:58.463 --> 30:01.216
- CRAIG, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT IT?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.718
- I JUST DIDN'T--I WAS KIND OF
SPEECHLESS WHEN IT HAPPENED.

30:03.801 --> 30:06.554
AS FAR AS--REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
TOO MANY THOUGHTS ON IT.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.556
I JUST FELT
THAT I WAS JUDGED ON SOMETHING

30:08.640 --> 30:11.601
THAT THE ACTUAL CHALLENGE
WASN'T ON.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.937
- JASON, YOU'RE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD.

30:14.020 --> 30:14.812
- YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S--
IT'S 'CAUSE HOW--

30:14.896 --> 30:16.564
THE JUDGING IS STARTING
TO GET ALL CRAZY

30:16.648 --> 30:17.815
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.859
{\an8}I MEAN, WHAT?
YOU'RE GONNA SEND A DUDE HOME

30:19.943 --> 30:21.402
{\an8}ON PROPORTION DAY
FOR BLACK AND GRAY?

30:21.486 --> 30:22.570
{\an8}I MEAN, SEND HIM HOME
ON BLACK-AND-GRAY DAY.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.072
IT'S BULL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- IT'S BASED ON EVERYTHING.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.740
- WHAT THE HELL? NO.
[cheers and applause]

30:25.823 --> 30:29.744
NO, IT'S NOT, DUDE.
OH, NO, IT'S NOT.

30:29.827 --> 30:31.788
YOU GUYS FLIP-FLOPPED
THE WHOLE TIME ON THE JUDGING.

30:31.871 --> 30:32.830
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW WE WERE

30:32.914 --> 30:34.374
GETTING JUDGED
AT A CERTAIN POINT.

30:34.457 --> 30:35.959
- AGAIN, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
ON THAT SIDE OF THE SEATS.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.294
- OH, OKAY.
[audience booing]

30:38.378 --> 30:40.755
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
- SORRY, BUD.

30:40.838 --> 30:41.589
- I GOT A CHALLENGE
FOR YOU TOO, THEN.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.508
- THAT'S FINE.
- LET'S HEAR FROM OLIVER.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.760
OLIVER?
- BUT SERIOUSLY, MAN.

30:45.843 --> 30:47.679
WE JUDGE EVERYTHING
YOU GIVE US.

30:47.762 --> 30:48.596
{\an8}EVERY TATTOO, REGARDLESS
OF WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS,

30:48.680 --> 30:51.266
{\an8}WHATEVER YOU DO
ON THAT PERSON,

30:51.349 --> 30:52.267
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA JUDGE IT.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.144
- OLIVER, THAT TATTOO
WAS IN PROPORTION, DUDE.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.563
- IT WAS A LI--
- IT WAS TOTALLY IN PROPORTION.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.106
- IT WAS AN UGLY TATTOO.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.732
- SO ARE WE JUDGING
BLACK AND GRAY OR PROPORTION?

30:59.816 --> 31:01.401
WHO CARES IF IT WAS UGLY?
- HEY...

31:01.484 --> 31:02.360
- EVERYBODY.

31:02.443 --> 31:03.653
- IT WAS AN UGLY TATTOO,
AND EVERYBODY CARES.

31:03.736 --> 31:07.031
AND FOR ONE,
ON BLACK-AND-GRAY DAY,

31:07.115 --> 31:07.657
HE DID NOT DO
A GOOD BLACK-AND-GRAY TATTOO.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.784
THE ONLY REASON HE STAYED--

31:09.867 --> 31:10.868
- THEN HE SHOULD HAVE GONE HOME
ON BLACK-AND-GRAY DAY.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.161
- THE ONLY REASON HE STAYED
IS 'CAUSE

31:12.245 --> 31:14.038
SOMEBODY ELSE DID
A WORSE BLACK-AND-GRAY TATTOO.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.331
- IF YOU GUYS ACTUALLY
HAD A SET OF RULES,

31:15.415 --> 31:17.959
THEN WE COULD DO
THIS COMPETITION RIGHT, THEN.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.711
- I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT HE SAID.
- I DIDN'T HEAR

31:19.794 --> 31:20.795
WHAT HE SAID EITHER.
- BECAUSE IT'S LOUD!

31:20.878 --> 31:22.964
- JUDGING WAS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.507
- THAT OPAQUE COMMENT SHOULD
COME IN HERE ANYTIME SOON.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.801
- EVERYTHING YOU GIVE US,
WE'RE GONNA JUDGE IT.

31:26.884 --> 31:27.760
- HERE'S THE THING--
- AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.470
- AND THE OTHER THING
IS THIS--

31:29.554 --> 31:32.932
{\an8}AND YOU CAN ALL SAY THAT I'M
LYING OR I'M WRONG OR I'M RIGHT.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.559
{\an8}- I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE LYING.

31:34.642 --> 31:35.727
- WHEN THE BLACK-AND-GRAY DAY
HAPPENED, I SAID,

31:35.810 --> 31:37.562
"NO MIXING WHITE
IN BLACK AND GRAY."

31:37.645 --> 31:38.813
ON THAT DAY, HE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN ON HIS HEELS

31:38.896 --> 31:40.315
AND WALKED
BECAUSE HE MIXED WHITE.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.191
RIGHT OR WRONG?

31:42.275 --> 31:43.318
- AND THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN YOUR FAULT

31:43.401 --> 31:44.360
FOR NOT SENDING HIM HOME.
- I GET IT.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.820
- RIGHT OR WRONG?

31:45.903 --> 31:47.405
SO ON THAT DAY, BECAUSE YOU ARE
A TREMENDOUS ARTIST,

31:47.488 --> 31:49.657
BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING AT YOU
AS A FRONT-RUNNER,

31:49.741 --> 31:51.492
BECAUSE I STILL TO THIS MOMENT,
IN THIS CHAIR,

31:51.576 --> 31:53.828
BELIEVE YOU SHOULD BE
OVER THERE,

31:53.911 --> 31:56.331
I WAS PISSED,
SO WE LET IT GO.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.041
WE WERE LIKE, "DAMN.
SO WHAT? GIVE HIM A PASS.

31:58.124 --> 32:02.337
"DON'T LET HIM GO HOME
BEFORE A LOT OF THE POTATOES.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.172
KEEP HIM. KEEP HIM."
- BUT--

32:04.255 --> 32:08.009
- AND GUESS WHAT.
WE KEPT YOU, AND WE TRIED.

32:08.092 --> 32:10.845
YOU NEVER CAME BACK
WITH BLACK AND GRAY STRAIGHT.

32:10.928 --> 32:14.182
THE WINNER OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>
FOR TWO SEASONS PAST,

32:14.265 --> 32:17.226
THE LAST TWO SEASONS
HAVE BEEN BLACK-AND-GRAY GUYS

32:17.310 --> 32:18.269
THAT COULD DO
AMAZING COLOR.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.563
[applause]

32:20.647 --> 32:23.524
YOU ARE AN AMAZING GUY
THAT DOES COLOR

32:23.608 --> 32:26.027
THAT WOULD NOT GIVE US BLACK
AND GRAY SO WE COULD KEEP YOU.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.820
YOU TOOK YOURSELF OUT.
- LET ME HEAR FROM JACKIE.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.782
YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU WANT TO CHIME IN.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.617
- YOU SAID HE HAD MADE THE ONE
MISTAKE ON BLACK-AND-GRAY DAY,

32:32.700 --> 32:35.578
BUT THE DONE--
HE WAS DOWN THERE,

32:35.662 --> 32:38.289
HE SHOULD HAVE WON MORE
THAN FOUR CHALLENGES, POSSIBLY.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.040
{\an8}HE WAS DOWN AT THE BOTTLE--

32:39.123 --> 32:41.376
{\an8}BOTTOM FOUR OR FIVE TIMES
IN A ROW.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.211
{\an8}- HE WOULD HAVE KNOCKED
ALL OF YOU GUYS OFF.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.545
- HE WAS AT THE BOTTOM
FOUR TIMES AS A--

32:44.629 --> 32:48.007
- WHO YOU POINTING AT?
- UH, DINGLEBERRY. JOSH.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.051
[laughter]

32:50.134 --> 32:53.763
[applause]

32:53.846 --> 32:54.847
- THAT'S IT.
IT'S NO DISRESPECT TO YOU GUYS,

32:54.931 --> 32:57.058
BECAUSE I RESPECT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.726
WE'RE HERE, BUT...
- LISTEN, BUT WHAT I'M SAYING--

32:58.810 --> 33:00.812
- FOUR TIMES AT THE BOTTOM,
AND TO SEND THIS GUY HOME

33:00.895 --> 33:02.021
THAT SHOULD HAVE WON
FOUR DIFFERENT COMPETITIONS?

33:02.105 --> 33:05.024
- HOWEVER, THOSE PEOPLE
THAT ARE SITTING OVER THERE

33:05.108 --> 33:05.775
DID IT ALL.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.110
THIS IS NOT
"YOUR STYLE MASTER."

33:07.193 --> 33:09.278
I SAY IT EVERY YEAR,
AND I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN.

33:09.362 --> 33:12.240
THEY DID IT ALL.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.659
THEY DESERVE TO SIT
IN THOSE SEATS.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.452
[applause]
- SURE, BUT WHAT--

33:16.536 --> 33:17.745
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.248
THANKS, CHRIS.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.417
GOT TO MOVE IT ON.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.502
WELL, THE JUDGES
HAD THEIR SAY EACH WEEK,

33:24.585 --> 33:26.754
BUT AMERICA ALSO
GOT TO SOUND OFF AND VOTE

33:26.838 --> 33:29.507
FOR THE TATTOO THAT THEY
THOUGHT WERE THE BEST.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.884
TONIGHT, WE'LL REVEAL
THE ONE ARTIST

33:31.968 --> 33:34.846
WHO GOT THE MOST VOTES
ALL SEASON LONG.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.639
BUT FIRST,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK

33:36.723 --> 33:39.517
AT SOME OF THE BEST TATTOOS
WE SAW THIS SEASON.

33:41.018 --> 33:43.020
EACH WEEK,
SPIKE AND TACO BELL

33:43.104 --> 33:44.856
ARE GIVING VIEWERS
THE OPPORTUNITY

33:44.939 --> 33:48.067
TO VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

33:48.151 --> 33:51.237
- IT HAS A LOT OF NICE DETAILS.
- YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN DRAW.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.864
- AS FAR
AS PRECISION GOES,

33:52.947 --> 33:54.365
THE LITTLE DETAILS
YOU PUT IN HERE,

33:54.449 --> 33:56.200
AND THE LITTLE CREASES
AND LINES AND FOLDS,

33:56.284 --> 33:57.452
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.370
I LOVE THIS TATTOO.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.665
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT SOLIDLY NAILED

34:02.749 --> 34:04.125
MULTIPLE KINDS OF TEXTURE.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.794
THE DETAIL IN THE ELEPHANT ALONE
IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.045
- IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.964
YOU'RE DEFINITELY THE GUY
TO WATCH AT THIS POINT.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.132
- YES!

34:11.215 --> 34:13.009
- THE PAINT ON THE FACE,
YOU NAILED IT.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.471
- YOU GOT A LOT OF GOOD,
RICH VALUES.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.388
THOSE ELEMENTS RIGHT THERE
ALONE ARE VERY GOOD.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.766
- THANK YOU, GUYS.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.141
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.311
YOU REALLY CREATED A LOT
OF DEPTH AND DIMENSION WITH IT.

34:23.393 --> 34:24.937
[all clapping]

34:25.021 --> 34:27.148
- I THINK YOU REALLY CAPTURED
THE ESSENCE OF THIS CHARACTER.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.274
- THANK YOU.

34:28.357 --> 34:31.944
- THE EXTRA TOUCHES REALLY
BROUGHT YOUR TATTOO TO LIFE.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.112
GREAT JOB.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.322
- YOU HIT ALMOST
EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE

34:35.406 --> 34:36.908
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE
COMPETITION ON THIS ONE TATTOO.

34:36.991 --> 34:40.286
- THE DIFFERENT TRICKS
THAT YOU PULLED OFF

34:40.369 --> 34:42.246
ARE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR

34:42.330 --> 34:44.665
SOMEBODY TO HOLD THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.667
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.879
[cheers and applause]

34:54.257 --> 34:55.927
- THERE WAS SOME AMAZING WORK.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.846
WEEK AFTER WEEK, AMERICA VOTED

38:46.157 --> 38:47.992
TO TRY TO PUSH
TO THE NEXT LEVEL,

38:48.075 --> 38:50.327
AND AGAINST THE FIELD OF PEOPLE
THAT YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST,

38:50.411 --> 38:52.038
YOU'VE REALLY
COME TO THE FOREFRONT

38:52.121 --> 38:53.414
AGAINST THAT FIELD.

39:10.347 --> 39:14.101
LIKE THIS

39:14.185 --> 39:15.978
I MEAN, I UNDERSTA--

39:16.062 --> 39:19.648
[cheers and applause]

39:22.026 --> 39:25.196
- I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S--

39:25.279 --> 39:26.447
IT'S VERY STRESSFUL
TO OPERATE

39:26.530 --> 39:28.741
UNDER THE CONDITIONS
WE GIVE YOU IN THIS COMPETITION,

39:28.824 --> 39:29.784
BUT YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND,

39:29.867 --> 39:30.993
IT'S HARD FOR US
TO JUDGE AS WELL.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.119
{\an8}YOU KNOW, THIS IS--IT--
CRITIQUING THESE TATTOOS

39:32.203 --> 39:34.205
{\an8}EVERY WEEK
AND PICKING SOMETHING,

39:34.288 --> 39:36.582
{\an8}WE HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE
OF THE PERSON,

39:36.665 --> 39:37.833
{\an8}OUTSIDE OF THE CRITERIA,

39:37.917 --> 39:39.376
{\an8}OUTSIDE OF THE STYLE
OF THAT CHOICE,

39:39.460 --> 39:42.546
{\an8}WHATEVER IS MAYBE DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT WE PERSONALLY LIKE.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.590
WE ALWAYS TRY TO LOOK
AT THE TATTOO

39:44.673 --> 39:47.051
AND TECHNICALLY,
WHAT IS STRONG ABOUT IT.

39:47.134 --> 39:49.303
AND THIS WEEK, AMERICA IS GONNA
HAVE TO DO THAT SAME THING.

39:49.386 --> 39:52.598
I HOPE THAT AMERICA
LOOKS AT THESE TATTOOS

39:52.681 --> 39:54.308
AND TRIES TO LOOK BEYOND
Y'ALL'S TWO PERSONALITIES,

39:54.391 --> 39:57.061
AND THE IMAGE
OR THE STYLE THEY LIKE,

39:57.144 --> 39:59.146
AND JUST PICK
THE BEST TATTOO.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.397
- CHRIS?

40:00.481 --> 40:01.816
- YEAH, THIS IS THE TRICKY PART
OF THIS SHOW.

BOTH CAME TO PERFORM.

40:07.571 --> 40:10.241
CHRIS, THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE BEST TATTOO

40:10.324 --> 40:12.535
THAT YOU'VE PRODUCED
WHILE YOU'VE BEEN ON CAMERA.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.454
- THAT'S WHAT I WANTED MORE THAN
ANYTHING, WAS TO SHOW ONCE--

40:15.538 --> 40:17.289
JUST ONE TIME--
I GOT OFF TO SUCH A BAD START,

40:17.373 --> 40:19.166
AND, LIKE, IT WAS JUST OVER
FROM THERE FOR ME,

40:19.250 --> 40:20.835
SO--I DON'T KNOW, I JUST WANTED
TO ROCK A NICE TATTOO

40:20.918 --> 40:23.003

42:01.352 --> 42:04.104
I'M PROVING THAT
I CAN TATTOO ANYTHING.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.357
- OH, MY GOD!

42:06.440 --> 42:08.275
- I'M IN TROUBLE.
- YOU TATTOO OFF YOUR EMOTIONS.

42:08.359 --> 42:09.735
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR WORK.

42:09.818 --> 42:10.319
- YOU [bleep] SUCK
AS AN ARTIST.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.404
- I'M JUST NOT NAILING IT.

42:12.488 --> 42:16.408
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME
WITH THIS LION.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.952
THERE'S NO OTHER WORD OTHER
THAN UNACCEPTABLE FOR THIS.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.621
- YOU'RE NOT DOING THE THINGS
THAT GOT YOU VOTED BACK.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.123
- I'M EMBARRASSING MYSELF.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.125
{\an8}MY HEART AND HEAD
ARE NOT IN THIS GAME,

42:25.209 --> 42:28.295
{\an8}AND I HAVE TO GO HOME.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.589
{\an8}- YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT?

42:30.673 --> 42:31.799
{\an8}ARE YOU GONNA FEEL GOOD
WITH QUITTING?

42:31.882 --> 42:34.134
{\an8}- I JUST GOT TO SUCK IT UP
AND FIGHT FOR IT.

42:34.218 --> 42:35.469
{\an8}WHETHER I'VE HAD FLAWS,

42:35.552 --> 42:36.637
{\an8}I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
BETTER THAN YOU.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.721
{\an8}THAT'S JUST A [bleep] FACT.

42:37.805 --> 42:38.222
{\an8}- I'M JUST SHOCKED
THAT YOU WOULD BE

42:38.305 --> 42:40.057
{\an8}A TOTAL CRAZY BITCH.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.351
{\an8}- I THINK THE ONLY BITCH
HERE IS YOU.

42:42.434 --> 42:43.519
{\an8}- WHAT YOU DID HERE, I LOVE.

42:43.602 --> 42:45.646
{\an8}I THINK YOU CAME BACK
REALLY STRONG.

42:45.729 --> 42:48.649
{\an8}- THE EXTRA TOUCHES
THAT YOU GAVE TO THIS TATTOO

42:48.732 --> 42:49.567
{\an8}REALLY BROUGHT
YOUR TATTOO TO LIFE.

42:49.650 --> 42:52.736
{\an8}THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE
ARE GONNA REMEMBER.

42:52.820 --> 42:53.988
WE'RE GLAD TO SEE
YOU FINALLY COME BACK.

42:54.071 --> 42:57.908
- I HAVE ALL THE [bleep] SKILLS
TO BE AN INK MASTER.

42:57.992 --> 42:58.742
I'M A [bleep] TATTOO ARTIST.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.244
I'M IN THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.287
I'M ALL-IN.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.080
I'M GONNA ROCK THE [bleep]
OUT OF MY FINALE PIECE.

43:03.163 --> 43:06.792
IT'S GONNA BE BADASS.

43:06.875 --> 43:11.755
[cheers and applause]

43:12.965 --> 43:15.551
- HI, BABY.

43:15.634 --> 43:19.388
SO AFTER ALL YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
IN THE PAST TWO SEASONS,

43:19.471 --> 43:22.224
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE IN THE FINAL THREE?

43:22.308 --> 43:25.144
- WELL, DAVE, IT FEELS GREAT.
YOU KNOW?

43:25.227 --> 43:26.228
IT'S DEFINITELY
VERY ACCOMPLISHING.

43:26.312 --> 43:30.232
{\an8}I HAD A LONG, BUMPY ROAD,
AND I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE

43:30.316 --> 43:31.859
{\an8}I WAS GOING THROUGH A LOT
THIS SEASON,

43:31.942 --> 43:32.943
{\an8}SPECIFICALLY AT HOME,

43:33.027 --> 43:35.696
{\an8}AND I FELT LIKE THERE
WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE, YOU KNOW?

43:35.779 --> 43:37.781
I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY WAS GONNA
EXPECT SO MUCH FROM ME,

43:37.865 --> 43:40.284
AND I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE GONNA
EXPECT SO MUCH FROM ME,

43:40.367 --> 43:42.077
AND SOMETIMES,
IT GOT TO MY HEAD.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.413
- YEAH.
AT ONE POINT--

43:44.496 --> 43:47.499
AT ONE POINT, YOU ALMOST
QUIT THE ENTIRE COMPETITION.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.376
ARE YOU GLAD
THAT YOU STUCK IT OUT?

43:49.460 --> 43:50.544
- I'M SO GLAD
THAT I DIDN'T QUIT.

43:50.627 --> 43:54.173
{\an8}I WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.

43:54.256 --> 43:55.466
{\an8}I WOULD HAVE DISAPPOINTED
MY FAMILY.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.301
{\an8}I WOULD HAVE DISAPPOINTED
ALL MY FANS

43:57.384 --> 43:59.094
{\an8}AND EVERYBODY
THAT SUPPORTS ME, SO I--

43:59.178 --> 44:00.095
- WE GOT--
- WHOO!

44:00.179 --> 44:01.847
- WE GOT SOMEBODY
SHAKING HIS HEAD BACK THERE.

44:01.930 --> 44:02.890
TAKE A GUESS AT WHO THAT IS.
[laughter]

44:02.973 --> 44:06.310
- JOSH, YOU WANT
TO CHIME IN?

44:06.393 --> 44:08.270
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEBODY
THAT WENT THROUGH

44:08.354 --> 44:10.606
{\an8}THIS COMPETITION
AND HAD SO MANY PERSONAL ISSUES,

44:10.689 --> 44:14.109
{\an8}DID SO MANY TERRIBLE TATTOOS,
TRIED TO QUIT,

44:14.193 --> 44:16.487
{\an8}DIDN'T FINISH SO MANY TATTOOS,
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CONFUSING

44:16.570 --> 44:18.113
{\an8}THAT SHE'S STANDING THERE
WITH THE OTHER TWO.

44:18.197 --> 44:22.117
[cheers and applause]

44:22.201 --> 44:23.744
- DAMN.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.287
- BABY, ANYTHING?

44:25.371 --> 44:27.915
- YOU KNOW WHAT, JOSHUA?

44:27.998 --> 44:29.750
I'M DOING--
I'M DONE DOING THIS WITH YOU.

44:29.833 --> 44:33.587
IF YOU PAID AS MUCH ATTENTION
TO YOUR TATTOOS AS YOU DO TO ME,

44:33.670 --> 44:34.171
MAYBE YOU'D BE HERE
IN THE FINALE.

44:34.254 --> 44:37.424
[cheers and applause]

44:37.508 --> 44:42.471
- CHRIS, YOU GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY HERE?

44:46.058 --> 44:47.434
LET'S HEAR FROM CHRIS.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.938
{\an1}- MAN, IT'S STUNNING THAT, JOSH,
YOU STILL JUST RUN YOUR MOUTH.

44:51.021 --> 44:54.066
[laughter]

44:54.149 --> 44:55.609
THIS IS IT FOR YOU, BUDDY.

44:55.692 --> 44:57.444
IT'S ALL UP IN FLAMES
FROM HERE.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.154
NOBODY THAT'S SITTING
BEHIND ME,

44:59.238 --> 45:00.197
THAT ARE THE MOST AMAZING
TATTOOERS ON THE PLANET,

45:00.280 --> 45:02.533
WILL EVER WANT YOU.

45:02.616 --> 45:04.743
YOU GET THAT?
- WOW.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.370
WOW.
- NEVER.

45:06.453 --> 45:09.456
- OH!
- WELL, BABY.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.125
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- PEOPLE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

45:11.208 --> 45:13.085
ABOUT YOU ON TV.
- SHUT UP, ONE-MACHINE MIKE.

45:13.168 --> 45:14.670
YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK!
- THAT'S THAT, MIKE?

45:14.753 --> 45:15.796
- [laughs]

45:15.879 --> 45:16.880
- I SAID I BET PEOPLE
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

45:16.964 --> 45:18.215
ABOUT YOUR FIRST TATTOO
ON TV.

45:18.298 --> 45:19.591
- HE DIDN'T COME
WITH ONE MACHINE, FOOL.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.093
[laughter]

45:21.176 --> 45:26.014
- I GOT MORE NOW.

45:26.098 --> 45:28.434
- ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT TO WRAP THIS UP.

45:28.517 --> 45:29.726
AS MUCH AS--
[laughter]

45:29.810 --> 45:30.686
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE

45:30.769 --> 45:32.563
TO WALK THROUGH
THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW...

45:32.646 --> 45:34.356
- YEAH.
- 'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

45:34.440 --> 45:35.816
- ALL RIGHT, BABY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

45:35.899 --> 45:37.192
WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING

45:37.276 --> 45:39.987
YOUR 35-HOUR
MASTER CANVAS LATER ON.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.156
[cheers and applause]

45:42.239 --> 45:43.657
- OUR NEXT FINALIST WAS ONE

45:43.740 --> 45:46.743

IN THE COMPETITION.

45:46.827 --> 45:50.372
FROM LAS VEGAS, NEVADA,
JOEY HAMILTON.

45:50.456 --> 45:54.418
[cheers and applause]

45:54.501 --> 45:57.296
- JOEY, LETS SEE
WHAT THE COMPETITION

45:57.379 --> 45:58.755
WAS LIKE FOR YOU.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.176
- HAVE YOU DONE EYELIDS
BEFORE?

46:02.259 --> 46:04.428
- I HAVE NOT, BUT I'VE
BEEN TATTOOING 17 YEARS,

46:04.511 --> 46:07.347
SO...I WOULDN'T BE WORRIED.

46:07.431 --> 46:09.475
PHOTO-REALISM IS ONE
OF MY SPECIALTIES.

46:09.558 --> 46:11.143
I LOVE TAKING THAT PICTURE

46:11.226 --> 46:12.895
AND TRYING TO REPRODUCE IT
ON THE SKIN.

46:12.978 --> 46:15.272
{\an8}I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE
A SECOND SEAT TO ANYBODY.

46:15.355 --> 46:17.024
- HE'S NOT LETTING ME
DO ANYTHING, SO I DON'T KNOW--

46:17.107 --> 46:18.901
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
- I DON'T CARE!

46:18.984 --> 46:20.027
LIKE, SOMETHING.
- DRAW THE BOTTOM DESIGN.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.862
- WITH THE SANDER?
- YEAH, WITH THE SANDER.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.030
HEAD'S UP.

46:23.113 --> 46:24.615
IF ME AND YOU ARE COMPETING,
I'D BEAT YOU.

46:24.698 --> 46:25.866
WHO'S THAT, GOT THE [bleep]
FIRST ONE TO TURN ON?

46:25.949 --> 46:29.119
WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE,
I'M GONNA KILL IT EITHER WAY.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.246
{\an8}- JOEY THINKS THAT HE DESERVES
EVERY SINGLE WIN

46:31.330 --> 46:32.623
{\an8}OF EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE.

46:32.706 --> 46:34.041
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SITTING HERE.

46:34.124 --> 46:35.209
{\an8}- I CAN'T EITHER.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.754
{\an8}- BUT, I MEAN, I'VE TATTOOED
BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE HERE.

46:38.837 --> 46:40.380
{\an8}- YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

46:40.464 --> 46:41.507
{\an8}- MAN, THIS
IS A [bleep] NICE TATTOO.

46:41.590 --> 46:44.426
{\an8}- THE DARKNESS
AND THE RICHNESS IN THIS

46:44.510 --> 46:46.220
{\an8}REALLY GIVES YOU
THE SENSE OF DIMENSION.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.179
{\an8}- YOU CAPTURED THE ESSENCE,

46:47.262 --> 46:48.680
{\an8}THE PLAYFULNESS,
THE DANGER OF CATWOMAN.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.808
{\an8}- GREAT JOB, MAN.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE SOMEBODY SHINE.

46:51.892 --> 46:52.809
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.061
{\an8}I'M BASICALLY
KICKING SOME ASS.

46:54.144 --> 46:56.355
{\an8}- GOD, SOMEBODY'S
FEELING COCKY TODAY, HUH?

46:56.438 --> 46:57.898
{\an8}YOU GIVE THIS GUY
A WIN, DUDE,

46:57.981 --> 46:59.817
{\an8}AND HE JUST TAKES OFF
FROM THERE.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.235
- AT LEAST I GOT A WIN.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.820
MULTIPLE WINS.

47:03.904 --> 47:05.364
- JOEY'S DEFINITELY
GONNA BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE

47:05.447 --> 47:06.865
WHO'S GONNA GIVE ME
A RUN FOR MY MONEY.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.575
- I WILL BE
THE NEXT INK MASTER.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.285
I'LL BE WALKING OUT
WITH THAT MONEY.

47:10.369 --> 47:11.745
SEE YOU SOON.

47:11.828 --> 47:15.082
GAME ON.

47:15.165 --> 47:18.377
[cheers and applause]

47:23.173 --> 47:26.510
- JOEY, I GOT TO KNOW,
HOW DOES IT FEEL

47:26.593 --> 47:27.594
TO BE THIS CLOSE
TO 100 GRAND?

47:27.678 --> 47:31.139
- IT ACTUALLY FEELS AMAZING.

47:31.223 --> 47:32.599
YOU KNOW, I SET
A HUGE GOAL FOR MYSELF

47:32.683 --> 47:34.851
TO BE STANDING UP HERE
IN THE FINAL THREE,

47:34.935 --> 47:36.853
AND I ACHIEVED THAT GOAL,
SO I'M PROUD OF MYSELF.

47:36.937 --> 47:38.021
- RIGHT ON.

47:38.105 --> 47:38.772
HOW DO YOU FEEL YOU STACK UP
AGAINST THESE TWO?

47:38.855 --> 47:39.648
- I ACTUALLY FEEL
LIKE I STACK UP

47:39.731 --> 47:42.776
REALLY WELL
AGAINST THESE GUYS.

47:42.859 --> 47:44.820
YOU KNOW, TATU BABY'S
A GREAT TATTOO ARTIST.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.281
{\an8}SHE DID HAVE A ROUGH RIDE
THIS SEASON,

47:47.364 --> 47:49.449
{\an8}AND JUST ONE QUICK POINT,
SHE DID DRAW--

47:49.533 --> 47:50.576
{\an8}ON THAT HEAD TATTOO,
I HAD--

47:50.659 --> 47:53.662
{\an8}SHE HAD DRAWN
TWO RIGHT FEET,

47:53.745 --> 47:56.206
{\an8}AND I HAD HELPED HER
WITH THAT DRAWING,

47:56.290 --> 47:56.999
{\an8}AND WHO KNOWS,
IF I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT,

47:57.082 --> 47:58.792
{\an8}IF SHE'D BE STANDING HERE
RIGHT NOW.

47:58.875 --> 47:59.835
- WOW.

47:59.918 --> 48:01.503
BABY, ANYTHING FOR THAT?

48:01.587 --> 48:02.796
- HONESTLY, JOEY,
YOU KNOW,

48:02.879 --> 48:05.465
IT WAS A--WE HAD
A VERY LIMITED TIME TO WORK

48:05.549 --> 48:08.594
ON THE DRAWING, AND FOR
THE BENEFIT OF MY CANVAS,

48:08.677 --> 48:11.638
IF I HAD TO ASK FOR
HELP I WOULD, AND I ASKED YOU.

48:11.722 --> 48:14.308
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP, BUT...

48:14.391 --> 48:16.143
[cheers and applause]
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

48:16.226 --> 48:17.644
- IT WAS A SKETCH,

48:17.728 --> 48:19.146
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
I WOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT.

48:19.229 --> 48:20.314
IT WASN'T THE STENCIL.

48:20.397 --> 48:22.649
YOU KNOW, I'M HERE BECAUSE
I WORKED MY BUTT OFF TO BE HERE.

48:22.733 --> 48:25.611
- YOU DID. FOR SURE.
I AGREE WITH THAT.

48:25.694 --> 48:26.737
I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THAT,

48:26.820 --> 48:28.989
AND YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
CAUGHT IT.

48:29.072 --> 48:30.198
I--IT'S JUST A COMMENT,
YOU KNOW, BUT...

48:30.282 --> 48:31.992
- DEFINITELY.

48:32.075 --> 48:33.285
- YOU KNOW, ME AND JIME,
I THINK IF--

48:33.368 --> 48:34.786
COMPETED AT A HIGHER LEVEL
TO THIS WHOLE SEASON,

48:34.870 --> 48:37.456
AND, YOU KNOW,
I JUST HAVE THAT GUT FEELING

48:37.539 --> 48:38.665
THAT IF YOU DON'T GET
ELIMINATED FIRST

48:38.749 --> 48:41.084
THAT I'D WANT
TO WALK OFF THE STAGE.

48:41.168 --> 48:42.461
- WOW.
- SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

48:42.544 --> 48:43.670
- I'M SORRY.
- WOW.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.964
- I'M SORRY.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.466
- WOW.

48:47.549 --> 48:49.509
THE FINAL MOMENT YOU'RE JUST
TURNING THE SCREW, HUH?

48:49.593 --> 48:51.345
- WOW.
RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE.

48:51.428 --> 48:54.473
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT JIME
AS YOUR COMPETITION?

48:54.556 --> 48:56.183
- WELL, JIME'S, YOU KNOW,
A GREAT TATTOO ARTIST.

48:56.266 --> 48:57.643
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR MANY YEARS.

48:57.726 --> 48:59.645
I'VE WORKED HIM--IN A COUPLE
DIFFERENT SHOPS WITH HIM.

48:59.728 --> 49:02.606
HE'S GOT AN AMAZING STYLE,
AND HE'S ALWAYS HAD THAT.

49:02.689 --> 49:05.025
AS FAR THE COMPETITION
THAT WE'RE IN, YOU KNOW,

49:05.108 --> 49:06.777
I BELIEVE
THAT I'M A MUCH MORE

49:06.860 --> 49:08.904
VERSATILE
TATTOO ARTIST THAN HE IS,

49:08.987 --> 49:09.404
AND I CAN DO
ALL KINDS OF TATTOOING.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.531
- ALL RIGHT.

49:11.615 --> 49:12.866
WELL, THANKS, JOEY.

49:12.949 --> 49:15.160
WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL TALK
TO OUR THIRD FINALIST,

49:15.243 --> 49:16.662
JIME LITWALK.

49:16.745 --> 49:19.456
WE'LL ALSO REVEAL
THE 35-HOUR MASTER CANVASES.

49:19.539 --> 49:21.458
IT'S ALL HAPPENING WHEN
<i>INK MASTER LIVE</i> RETURNS.

49:21.541 --> 49:25.796
[cheers and applause]

49:36.390 --> 49:39.559
[cheers and applause]

49:42.646 --> 49:43.814
{\an8}- WELCOME BACK.

49:43.897 --> 49:44.898

{\an8}KYLE OR CHRIS.

49:54.825 --> 49:58.161
{\an8}BUT NOW WE HAVE ONE MORE
FINALIST TO TALK TO TONIGHT.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.372
BEST KNOWN
FOR HIS NEW SCHOOL STYLE,

50:00.455 --> 50:03.625
THIS SEASON HE PROVED
THAT HE CAN DO A WHOLE LOT MORE.

50:03.709 --> 50:06.503
FROM ORLANDO, FLORIDA,
JIME LITWALK.

50:06.586 --> 50:07.337
[cheers and applause]

50:07.421 --> 50:11.425
LET'S TAKE A LOOK HOW
JIME GOT HERE.

50:11.508 --> 50:13.510
- JIME.

50:13.593 --> 50:15.512
{\an8}- I'M KNOWN FOR BEING
ONE OF THE PEOPLE

50:15.595 --> 50:17.514
{\an8}WHO STARTED NEW SCHOOL
STYLE OF TATTOOING.

50:17.597 --> 50:19.766
{\an8}I'VE BEEN TATTOOING NOW
FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS.

50:19.850 --> 50:20.559
{\an8}I CAME HERE FOR A REASON.

50:20.642 --> 50:23.645
{\an8}I'M HERE TO WIN.

50:23.729 --> 50:24.855
{\an8}- ONE OF MY BIGGEST IDOLS
IS JIME LITWALK.

50:24.938 --> 50:26.732
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN WAITING 15 YEARS
TO GET TATTOOED BY JIME LITWALK.

50:26.815 --> 50:27.983
{\an8}- I'LL GO AHEAD
AND ROCK WITH JIME.

50:28.066 --> 50:31.194
{\an8}- I'M GONNA HOOK THAT
[bleep] THING UP.

50:31.278 --> 50:33.238
{\an8}- JIME BEING COCKY IS A RESULT

50:33.321 --> 50:35.115
{\an8}OF THE ENTIRE GROUP
STROKING HIS EGO.

50:35.198 --> 50:36.616
{\an8}THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE
BY JIME THAT I CAN'T DRAW.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.453
{\an8}I DREW THIS GODDAMN THING.

50:39.536 --> 50:40.495
{\an8}- DUDE, WHAT THE [bleep] DID

50:40.579 --> 50:41.121
{\an8}I HAVE TO DO WITH
ANY OF YOUR [bleep]?

50:41.204 --> 50:44.458
{\an8}YOU'RE JUST, LIKE, A DICKHEAD.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.793
{\an8}WE GET TO TIE JOSH TO
A TORPEDO, THEN LAUNCH HIS ASS.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.336
{\an8}- JIME'S A [bleep] DICK.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.797
{\an8}- THE BIG MARK THAT YOU MISSED
TODAY IS COMIC BOOK.

50:50.881 --> 50:51.965
{\an8}- I STAND BEHIND MY TATTOO.

50:52.048 --> 50:55.302
{\an8}CAN'T MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.
- WE KNOW YOU CAN DRAW.

50:55.385 --> 50:56.094
{\an8}ALL YOU HAVE TO PROVE
IS THAT YOU CAN OUT-GAME

50:56.178 --> 50:58.972
{\an8}THESE OTHER
[bleep] CHUMPS, MAN.

50:59.055 --> 51:00.140
{\an8}- AS ONE OF
THE NEW SCHOOL KIDS,

51:00.223 --> 51:02.476
{\an8}I NEED TO PROVE
THAT I CAN DO OTHER THINGS.

51:02.559 --> 51:05.687
{\an8}- THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY
GOES TO JIME.

51:05.771 --> 51:06.813
- IT JUST SHOWS THIS GUY
KNOWS HIS [bleep].

51:06.897 --> 51:09.983
- I WANTED TO SEE NONE OF YOUR
OWN STYLE IN THIS TATTOO.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.318
YOU HIT IT.

51:11.401 --> 51:13.612
YOU PULLED OFF WHAT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR WHEN WE'RE

51:13.695 --> 51:15.197
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO HOLD
THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.617
- I WON'T LET YOU GUYS DOWN.
I PROMISE. I'M GONNA BRING IT.

51:18.700 --> 51:20.160
I HAVE A HIGH RESPECT
FOR JOEY AND TATU BABY,

51:20.243 --> 51:24.039
BUT MY GOAL IS TO DRIVE
TO THE END OF THIS FINISH LINE.

51:24.122 --> 51:25.290
I'M [bleep] EVERYBODY.

51:25.373 --> 51:26.374
I'M GOING FOR THE TITLE.

51:26.458 --> 51:27.626
[laughs]

51:27.709 --> 51:33.590
[cheers and applause]

51:34.549 --> 51:37.594
- JIME.

51:37.677 --> 51:40.722
HOW YOU FEELING, JIME?
- WHOO!

51:40.806 --> 51:43.350
- HOW YOU FEELING?
- I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD.

51:43.433 --> 51:44.184
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT.

51:44.267 --> 51:46.937
HAPPY WITH WHAT
I'VE DONE ALL SEASON,

51:47.020 --> 51:48.396
AND I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY
WITH MY 35-HOUR CANVAS.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.732
- COOL.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.776
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE VERSATILE
ENOUGH TO BE INK MASTER?

51:52.859 --> 51:55.278
{\an8}- IF I WASN'T VERSATILE ENOUGH
I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE.

51:55.362 --> 51:57.572
{\an8}- YEAH!
[cheers and applause]

51:57.656 --> 51:59.699
{\an8}- LOOK AT THIS.
ANOTHER SHAKING HEAD FROM JASON.

51:59.783 --> 52:02.160
- OH, MAN.
- WHAT'S UP?

52:02.244 --> 52:04.621
- MY LITTLE PRINCESS OVER HERE.
- [laughs]

52:04.704 --> 52:06.665
- I MEAN, DUDE, COME ON.
YOU'RE NOT THAT VERSATILE.

52:06.748 --> 52:07.290
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN
A NEW SCHOOL ARTIST

52:07.374 --> 52:09.584
ON EVERY CHALLENGE YOU DID.

52:09.668 --> 52:11.461
I MEAN, COME ON, DUDE.

52:11.545 --> 52:12.629
YOU DID THE BEST-LOOKING

52:12.712 --> 52:14.214
NEW-SCHOOL GRAND CANYON
I EVER DID SEE.

52:14.297 --> 52:15.382
- I MEAN, I--

52:15.465 --> 52:16.508
- THE ONLY THING

52:15.465 --> 52:16.508
THAT WAS MISSING

52:16.591 --> 52:16.925
FROM THAT CARTOON
WAS A ROAD RUNNER, DUDE.

52:17.008 --> 52:18.885
I MEAN, YOU KNOW?

52:18.969 --> 52:19.803
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT
I HAVE A RECOGNIZABLE STYLE

52:19.886 --> 52:21.847
AND JUST BAD TATTOOING.

52:21.930 --> 52:22.931
- YOU--BUT YOU COMPLAINED, AND--
all: OOH!

52:23.014 --> 52:25.141
- BUT YOU COMPLAINED AND BITCHED
ABOUT DOING NEW SCHOOL

52:25.225 --> 52:26.560
THE WHOLE SEASON,
AND YOU WANTED TO DO, LIKE--

52:26.643 --> 52:28.103
- NO, NO, NO,
SEE, OVER 20 YEARS I'VE WORKED

52:28.186 --> 52:30.105
TO DEVELOP A STYLE
THAT'S RECOGNIZABLE.

52:30.188 --> 52:32.232
- BUT WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT VERSATILITY.

52:32.315 --> 52:33.400
- SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW
I'VE DONE SOMETHING,

52:33.483 --> 52:35.360
AND NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST--
COPYING A PHOTO.

52:35.443 --> 52:37.445
I'VE DONE SOMETHING THAT--

52:37.529 --> 52:40.073
YOU KNOW, I STAND BEHIND
ALL MY WORK 100%.

52:40.156 --> 52:41.700
CAN YOU SAY YOU'VE DONE
THAT THIS TIME?

52:41.783 --> 52:43.660
- I KNOW I WAS A LITTLE MORE
VERSATILE THAN YOU WERE.

52:43.743 --> 52:45.078
- IF YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT VERSATILE

52:45.161 --> 52:45.745
BEING DOING
BAD TATTOOS, YEAH.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.747
- WHOA.
- WOW.

52:47.831 --> 52:48.623
- COME ON, MAN.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

52:48.707 --> 52:49.416
- WOW.

52:49.499 --> 52:50.625
- YEAH, WE SAW
YOUR POISON IVY, DUDE.

52:50.709 --> 52:51.501
- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS.

52:51.585 --> 52:53.003
- THAT WAS A SOLID TATTOO
UP THERE, BUDDY.

52:53.086 --> 52:54.129
- AH, ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

52:54.212 --> 52:56.590
- ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT TO MOVE THIS ALONG.

52:56.673 --> 52:58.091
GOD, I LOVE THIS STUFF, THOUGH.
[laughter]

52:58.174 --> 52:59.134
- I WISH WE COULD DO
A WHOLE SHOW

52:59.217 --> 53:00.135
WITH JUST THIS KIND
OF BICKERING.

53:00.218 --> 53:01.177
- I LOVE MY LITTLE PRINCESS.
- YEAH.

53:01.261 --> 53:02.554
- I HAVE TO GIVE HIM SOME--

53:02.637 --> 53:05.015
- WELL, JIME, TATU BABY AND JOEY
ARE BOTH KNOWN FOR PHOTOREALISM.

53:05.098 --> 53:07.100
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE
AN ADVANTAGE

53:07.183 --> 53:08.518
BECAUSE YOU DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

53:08.602 --> 53:09.769
- COMPLETELY.

53:09.853 --> 53:14.149
{\an8}I THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS
IMAGINATION VERSUS DUPLICATION.

53:14.232 --> 53:15.400
{\an8}I THINK THE FACT THAT I CAN

53:15.483 --> 53:17.944
{\an8}TAKE SOMETHING AND MAKE IT
RECOGNIZABLE ON MY OWN

53:18.028 --> 53:20.614
{\an8}AS OPPOSED TO JUST TAKING
A PHOTO AND JUST COPYING IT.

53:20.697 --> 53:21.740
- ALL RIGHT, JIME.
THANKS, MAN.

53:21.823 --> 53:22.657
GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

53:22.741 --> 53:26.786
[cheers and applause]

53:26.870 --> 53:28.705
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

53:28.788 --> 53:32.959
JIME, JOEY, AND TATU BABY
HAD 35 HOURS TO CREATE

53:33.043 --> 53:37.130
A TATTOO THAT WILL
EARN ONE OF THEM $100,000.

53:37.213 --> 53:40.592
UP NEXT, WE'LL REVEAL AND
CRITIQUE THEIR MASTER CANVASES.

53:40.675 --> 53:42.052
STAY WITH US.

53:42.135 --> 53:45.472
[cheers and applause]

53:56.733 --> 53:57.776
[cheers and applause]

53:57.859 --> 53:59.778
- HEY.
- YOU.

53:59.861 --> 54:02.739
- ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME BACK.

54:02.822 --> 54:03.865
TONIGHT, KYLE AND CHRIS
TATTOOED HEAD-TO-HEAD

54:03.949 --> 54:07.118
FOR A SPOT ON SEASON FOUR.

54:07.202 --> 54:09.913
KYLE, CHRIS, IMPRESSIVE WORK.

54:09.996 --> 54:11.331
- THANKS, MAN.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.333
- TONIGHT, AMERICA, YOU VOTED

54:13.416 --> 54:16.962
A SECOND CHANCE

54:17.045 --> 54:19.839
AND THE VOTES ARE TALLIED.

54:19.923 --> 54:22.175
AMERICA HAS SPOKEN.

54:22.258 --> 54:24.636
WITH 79% OF THE VOTE AND OVER

54:24.719 --> 54:28.640
360,000 VOTES
ALL TOGETHER...

54:35.021 --> 54:40.777
audience members: KYLE!

54:41.945 --> 54:43.446
- COME ON, KYLE.

54:43.530 --> 54:44.614
- KYLE.

54:44.698 --> 54:45.740
- KYLE!

54:45.824 --> 54:49.869
[cheers and applause]

54:49.953 --> 54:54.582
WE WILL BE SEEING YOU
ON <i> INK MASTER</i> SEASON FOUR.

54:54.666 --> 54:57.544
[cheers and applause]

55:00.046 --> 55:02.882
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MAN.

55:02.966 --> 55:05.218
- CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.

55:05.301 --> 55:06.886
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE ON THE TV.

55:06.970 --> 55:07.721
- KYLE.
- YES, SIR.

55:07.804 --> 55:10.515
- YOU READY TO DO THIS
WHOLE THING AGAIN?

55:10.598 --> 55:13.226
- [sighs] BARELY.
[laughter]

55:13.309 --> 55:15.061
- YEAH!
- YES.

55:15.145 --> 55:18.898
- YEAH! [bleep] YEAH!
- YEAH YOU ARE.

55:18.982 --> 55:21.192
OLIVER, ANY WORDS FOR KYLE?

55:21.276 --> 55:22.527
- KYLE, I'M GLAD TO HEAR
IT'S YOU, MAN.

55:22.610 --> 55:25.030
CHRIS, GOOD JOB
ON THAT TATTOO.

55:25.113 --> 55:26.531
IT'S REALLY GOOD
FOR YOU TO COME BACK

55:26.614 --> 55:28.408
AND SHOW US SOMETHING
THAT WAS WORTHY TO BE SEEN.

55:28.491 --> 55:31.619
I REALLY--I'M PROUD TO SEE YOU
BACK, BUT, KYLE, MAN?

55:31.703 --> 55:33.747
NEXT SEASON, YOU GOT TO KEEP
YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.415
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

55:35.498 --> 55:37.042
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
THIS ADVANTAGE.

55:37.125 --> 55:38.918
IT'S GONNA BE--
IT'S GONNA BE BIG, MAN.

55:39.002 --> 55:40.336
YOU GOT TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT.

55:40.420 --> 55:42.589
DON'T GIVE US
NONE OF THAT CRAZY [bleep].

55:42.672 --> 55:45.633
[laughter]

55:45.717 --> 55:47.635
- CHRIS?
- KYLE, THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE.

55:47.719 --> 55:50.221
YOU'VE BEEN HERE NOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

55:50.305 --> 55:53.058
YOU KEEP PROGRESSING
IN YOUR DOWNTIME.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.477
STUDY EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'RE NOT SURE OF.

55:55.560 --> 55:56.770
COME BACK STRONG, MAN.
DON'T LET US DOWN.

55:56.853 --> 55:59.272
CHRIS, GREAT JOB.
- OH, THANKS, MAN.

55:59.355 --> 56:00.648
IT'S TOTALLY COOL.
- YEAH.

56:00.732 --> 56:01.900
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, CHRIS.

56:01.983 --> 56:04.778
[cheers and applause]
RIGHT ON.

56:04.861 --> 56:06.488
ALL RIGHT. KYLE, MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.

56:06.571 --> 56:09.616
YOU HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE
HAVING BEEN THROUGH THIS ONCE.

56:09.699 --> 56:12.702
BE READY TO MAKE
THE MOST OF IT.

56:12.786 --> 56:15.121
THIS SEASON,
WE GAVE THE THREE FINALISTS

56:15.205 --> 56:18.625
AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY
AND AN EXTREME CHALLENGE.

56:18.708 --> 56:20.251
FOR THEIR FINAL TATTOO,

56:20.335 --> 56:22.462
THEY WERE ASSIGNED
A MASTER CANVAS

56:22.545 --> 56:25.298
AND HAD 35 HOURS TO TATTOO
THE DESIGN AND THE STYLE

56:25.381 --> 56:29.761
OF THEIR CHOICE, AND OVER
THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS

56:29.844 --> 56:32.639
THEY'VE ENDURED
FIVE SEVEN-HOUR SESSIONS

56:32.722 --> 56:36.684
TO CREATE A TATTOO WORTHY
OF THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

56:36.768 --> 56:40.480
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT HOW IT WENT.

56:45.110 --> 56:47.237
{\an8}- IT'S THE FINAL THREE.
IT'S THE BIG COMPETITION.

56:47.320 --> 56:50.615
{\an8}THIS IS THE TATTOO THAT'S GONNA
WIN ME THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

56:52.575 --> 56:57.372
{\an8}- THERE IS $100,000 ON THE LINE,
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.

57:00.208 --> 57:04.254
{\an8}- I HAVE 35 HOURS.
THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE.

57:04.337 --> 57:05.171
{\an8}GIVE ME THE TITLE.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.882
YOU READY TO DO THIS?
- YEAH.

57:07.966 --> 57:10.260
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN TO
ANYTHING, SO I'M CONCERNED

57:10.343 --> 57:11.594
THAT I'M GONNA GET
A TATTOO I DON'T WANT.

57:11.678 --> 57:13.221
- THAT'S THE DRAWING I DID.

57:13.304 --> 57:16.724
MY TATTOO IS A REALISTIC,
UNDERWATER SCENE WITH A MERMAID.

57:16.808 --> 57:19.853
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING FOR
IS THAT BIG "WOW" FACTOR.

57:19.936 --> 57:21.521
{\an8}- THIS IS WHAT I GOT.

57:21.604 --> 57:22.063
I LOVE PHOTOREALISM.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.440
I LOVE TO TATTOO ANIMALS.

57:24.524 --> 57:26.192
I CANNOT WAIT TO GET STARTED.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.027
- IT'S REALLY
NOT THAT TASTEFUL.

57:28.111 --> 57:28.820
DO I REALLY WANT
SOME RANDOM GIRL

57:28.903 --> 57:31.906
ON MY BACK
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?

57:35.201 --> 57:37.412
- HERE WE GO.
- I THINK WE GOT A WINNER.

57:37.495 --> 57:38.872
I AM DOING A BATTLE ROYALE.

57:38.955 --> 57:39.956
IT'S BASICALLY AN EAGLE,
A DRAGON,

57:40.039 --> 57:41.833
AND A SNAKE BATTLING IT
OUT IN A FIGHT TO THE DEATH.

57:41.916 --> 57:44.085
- SO BADASS.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.378
I WANT YOU TO WIN
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

57:45.461 --> 57:47.922
- IT'S THE PERFECT TATTOO
THAT SYMBOLIZES ME

57:48.006 --> 57:49.549
BEING IN THIS
COMPETITION.

57:49.632 --> 57:54.554
{\an8}- MAN, MY DAD'S GONNA KILL ME
IF HE SEES THIS.

57:54.637 --> 57:56.097
I'M REALLY NOT COOL WITH THIS.

57:56.181 --> 57:58.057
I'M GONNA GROW UP,
I'M GONNA BE A FATHER ONE DAY,

57:58.141 --> 57:59.475
AND HERE I HAVE SOME RANDOM GIRL
ON MY BACK

57:59.559 --> 58:02.562
THAT HAS NO RELATION
TO ME OR MY FAMILY.

58:02.645 --> 58:04.397
- FIRST SESSION IS DONE.

58:04.480 --> 58:06.691
- IT IS A LOT OF MONEY
ON THE LINE FOR HER,

58:06.774 --> 58:07.567
BUT IT'S NOT ANY
MONEY ON THE LINE FOR ME.

58:07.650 --> 58:09.903
I ABSOLUTELY KNOW
THAT I AM NOT COMING BACK

58:09.986 --> 58:14.240
FOR THE NEXT SESSION
AND BEST OF LUCK TO HER.

58:14.324 --> 58:17.076
[tires squeal]

58:22.373 --> 58:23.583
- HEY, DAVE.

58:23.666 --> 58:25.919
HOW ARE YOU?
- THERE'S BEEN A SITUATION.

58:26.002 --> 58:30.673
UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR MASTER
CANVAS IS NOT COMING BACK.

58:32.342 --> 58:36.095
SO WE ARE GONNA SEND YOU
A NEW MASTER CANVAS,

58:36.179 --> 58:39.224
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH.

58:39.307 --> 58:40.433
ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

58:40.516 --> 58:44.270
- I AM COMPLETELY
IN SHOCK RIGHT NOW.

58:44.354 --> 58:47.690
I REALLY DID NOT
EXPECT HIM TO PULL OUT.

58:47.774 --> 58:51.277
I HOPE THAT IT'S NOT GONNA
EFFECT MY CHANCE TO WIN.

58:51.361 --> 58:54.322
- IT'S CRAZY.

58:54.405 --> 58:58.326
I GOT TO WONDER WHAT THE OTHER
PEOPLE ARE DOING, YOU KNOW?

59:01.246 --> 59:02.956
- HI!
- HI. I'M STANLEY.

59:03.039 --> 59:03.957
- HI, STANLEY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

59:04.040 --> 59:07.835
I'M SO DISAPPOINTED,
BUT I MADE IT THIS FAR.

59:07.919 --> 59:10.546
I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING
STOP ME RIGHT NOW.

59:10.630 --> 59:12.840
- TAKE A LOOK AT THAT...
- LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

59:12.924 --> 59:13.967
- AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK,
BUDDY.

59:14.050 --> 59:15.301
THIS TATTOO IS GONNA
SECURE ME THE WIN.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.262
BEING ABLE TO DRAW SOMETHING

59:17.345 --> 59:18.304
SUPER CREATIVE
DEFINITELY GIVES ME ADVANTAGE.

59:18.388 --> 59:21.641
- THAT IS FREAKING AMAZING.

59:21.724 --> 59:24.644
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE TATU BABY
OR JOEY CAN DO WHAT I DO.

59:24.727 --> 59:26.646
- YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

59:26.729 --> 59:29.023
- WOW.

59:29.107 --> 59:32.110
- I WORKED SO HARD PUTTING
MY ALL INTO THIS PIECE.

59:32.193 --> 59:34.445
I DESERVE TO WIN.

59:34.529 --> 59:37.031
- I PUT EVERYTHING I HAD
INTO THIS TATTOO.

59:37.115 --> 59:38.491
I CAME HERE TO COMPETE AND
I CAME HERE TO WIN THE MONEY.

59:38.574 --> 59:41.244
- THAT'S THE BEST TATTOO
I'VE EVER SEEN.

59:41.327 --> 59:45.206
- MARK MY WORDS, I'M GONNA BE
THE NEXT INK MASTER.

59:45.290 --> 59:50.169
[cheers and applause]

59:51.921 --> 59:55.049
- ALL RIGHT.

59:55.133 --> 59:58.511
UP NEXT, THE THREE FINALISTS
REVEAL THEIR 35-HOUR TATTOOS.

59:58.594 --> 01:00:01.306
ONE ARTIST WILL EARN
THE TITLE OF INK MASTER

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:04.600
AND WALK AWAY
WITH $100,000.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.728
STAY TUNED.

01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:08.730
[cheers and applause]

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.581
{\an8}- WELCOME BACK
TO <i> INK MASTER LIVE,</i>

01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:30.209
AND NOW THE MOMENT
WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.879
THE FINALISTS HAD 35 HOURS

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:35.048
TO CREATE THE BEST WORK
OF THEIR CAREERS,

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:38.217
BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO EARN
THEM THE TITLE OF INK MASTER?

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:42.305
IT'S TIME TO REVEAL AND CRITIQUE
THE FINALIST'S TATTOOS.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:43.514
TATU BABY, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:47.602
LET'S BRING OUT
YOUR MASTER CANVAS.

01:00:47.685 --> 01:00:49.812
[cheers and applause]

01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:58.154
- OLIVER?

01:00:58.237 --> 01:01:03.785
[cheers and applause]

01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:06.579
- OLLIE, CARE TO
CHIME IN ON THIS ONE?

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:09.540
- YEAH. TATU BABY.

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:13.961
TATU BABY,
THIS IS A BIG TATTOO.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.506
REALLY GOOD TO SEE THIS
COME OUT OF YOU.

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:19.258
THERE'S SO MANY GOOD THINGS
ABOUT THIS TATTOO,

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.010
BUT FIRST OF ALL,
WE'RE NOT HERE

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.929
TO TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.472
{\an8}THIS IS OUR TOUGH JOB
TO CRITIQUE.

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:25.640
{\an8}WE'RE HERE TO PICK
THIS THING APART,

01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:27.350
{\an8}AND IT'S GONNA BE
A ROUGH CRITIQUE--

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:29.268
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE A ROUGH
CRITIQUE FOR ALL THREE OF YOU.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.104
THIS IS $100,000 ON THE LINE.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.355
WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE NICE.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:33.272
YOU KNOW?

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.023
FIRST OF ALL I'LL SAY YOU DID

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.275
SOME OF THE NICEST
HANDS TATTOOED

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.485
WE'VE SEEN IN THE HISTORY
OF INK MASTER ON THIS THING.

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:40.905
THIS THING IS SUPER CLEAN
IN A LOT OF AREAS,

01:01:40.988 --> 01:01:42.865
BUT IT HAS SOME
MAJOR PROBLEMS.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:46.869
I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE'S THE WOLF'S BODY?

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.871
WHAT IS THAT WEIRD THING COMING
DOWN FROM THE WOLF WHERE IT'S--

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.081
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
THE WOLF'S LEG?

01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:52.417
IT'S VERY CONFUSING.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:57.004
IS THE GIRL BURIED IN THE GROUND
AND ONLY HALF OF HER BODY--

01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:00.007
THERE'S A GRASS LINE, AND
THEN A WOLF STANDING THERE,

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:01.884
AND THEN A GIRL WITH--
THE REST OF HER BODY IS GONE?

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.386
IT'S VERY STRANGE.

01:02:03.469 --> 01:02:06.806
IT DOESN'T FIT WELL ON THIS
GUY'S BODY, AND MAINLY THAT

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:10.852
THE TOMAHAWK AT THE BOTTOM
LOOKS LIKE AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

01:02:10.935 --> 01:02:13.980
YOU KNOW, JUST--
IT'S VERY STRANGE.

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:16.107
THERE'S SOME GREAT,
INTENSE DETAIL IN THIS.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:18.317
YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE DETAILS,
THE LITTLE BEADED WORK

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.903
ON THE TOMAHAWK AND ON THE TOP
OF THE HEADBAND IS NICE,

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.823
BUT THEN IN THE FEATHERS,
IF YOU LOOK CLOSE

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.450
THERE'S A LOT OF SKETCHY--
A LOT OF SKETCHY DETAILS.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.869
A LOT OF STUFF
THAT'S NOT CLEAN.

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:28.327
A LOT OF STUFF THAT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN A LITTLE TIGHTER.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.663
- THANKS, OLLIE.

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.290
CHRIS, LET'S HEAR FROM YOU.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:34.876
- WELL, YOU KNOW, AS ALWAYS,

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:37.086
{\an8}I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE
THE AMOUNT OF BLACK

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.006
{\an8}THAT YOU PUT INTO A TATTOO,
BUT BEFORE YOU GET TO THE BLACK

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:43.092
YOU HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE STAGE OF THE STENCIL.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.303
WHEN YOU PUT THE STENCIL
ON THE SKIN YOU HAVE TO LOOK

01:02:45.386 --> 01:02:49.640
AND SEE WHERE THE STENCIL
FINISHES, CORRECT?

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.601
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE STENCIL'S NOT LAYING

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:53.895
ON A VITAL PART WHERE THE FACE
OR THE TORSO IS GONNA MOVE.

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:58.566
IN THIS PARTICULAR PICTURE,
YOUR CLIENT'S ARMS ARE PULLED

01:02:58.649 --> 01:03:00.651
TOTALLY FORWARD
AND HE'S STRETCHING HIS BACK.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:04.572
IF HIS ARMS WOULD BE AT HIS SIDE
IN A NORMAL BACK PIECE PICTURE,

01:03:04.655 --> 01:03:06.824
HER TORSO AND HER NECK
WOULD BE COMPLETELY OFF.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:10.411
YOU PLACED THE TATTOO
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.580
TO START, PLACEMENT
IN A TATTOO IS EVERYTHING.

01:03:12.663 --> 01:03:15.082
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CLIENT
RIGHT NOW--

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:16.709
PLEASE, PUT YOUR ARMS
AT YOUR SIDE.

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:19.337
HIS SHOULDERS WILL POP OUT.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.130
IT WILL DISTORT THE WAY--

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:24.550
THAT WE SEE IN THE PHOTOS
WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE TATTOOS,

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.844
THE WAY THAT
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS.

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:28.888
YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL
OF PLACEMENT

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.056
OF A STENCIL
TO DO A BACK PIECE.

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:33.434
- CAN I JUST MAKE
A NOTE FROM THAT?

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:35.937
THIS DESIGN WAS DESIGNED
FOR MY FIRST CANVAS.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.772
UNFORTUNATELY HE DID DROP OUT
AND DIDN'T WANT

01:03:37.855 --> 01:03:42.401
TO CONTINUE THE TATTOO,
AND THEN I MET LOVELY STAN,

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:46.113
BUT UNFORTUNATELY STAN HAD THIS
HUGE SCAR FROM HERE TO HERE,

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:48.282
WHICH IS ALSO WHY,
YOU KNOW,

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.952
YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT
OF THE DANCING ON THE TATTOO,

01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:52.787
AND HE HAD ANOTHER TATTOO,

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:54.914
SO I WAS WORKING
A LITTLE BIT ALREADY

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:57.250
AGAINST PLACEMENT,
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ON--

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.044
- BUT THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
TO PUT SOMETHING CENTERED,

01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:02.588
IN THE BACK, AND MAKE
A BEAUTIFUL BACK PIECE.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:05.216
YOU CAN NEVER PUT
AN ARM OR A NECK

01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:06.259
OFF TO THE SIDE
ON A SHOULDER.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.386
- THANKS, CHRIS.

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:11.764
ALL RIGHT, JOEY,
YOU'RE UP NEXT.

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:14.100
LET'S BRING OUT
YOUR MASTER CANVAS.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:18.062
[cheers and applause]

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:24.527
- OLIVER PECK,
THOUGHTS ON THIS PIECE?

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.946
- WELL, JOEY,
WE'RE VERY IMPRESSED

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.114
TO SEE THIS
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.490
I MEAN, THIS IS
A BIG UNDERTAKING.

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:30.658
IT IS A LARGE TATTOO.

01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:31.784
JUST 'CAUSE IT'S NOT
A BACK PIECE,

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:33.619
IT'S STILL A LOT
OF WORK ON THE LEG,

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.497
AND THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL
YOU PUT IN THE SMALL AREAS

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:39.125
ALL THROUGHOUT THIS BIG
TATTOO IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:42.962
THE DETAIL ON THE TURTLE, THE
CORAL, YOU KNOW, IS REALLY NICE,

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.798
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THING
FROM A DISTANCE IT'S VERY MUTED.

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:48.926
NOTHING IS VIBRANT.
NOTHING STANDS OUT.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.220
IT LACKS CONTRAST.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:55.141
IT LACKS ENOUGH BLACK
TO MAKE THESE COLORS STAND OUT.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.476
YOU'VE GOT LIGHT BLUE
NEXT TO LIGHT GREEN

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.104
NEXT TO LIGHT YELLOW,
AND IT'S JUST--

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:05.234
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE RICH,
BRIGHT, CONCENTRATED HIGHLIGHTS

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:08.487
THAT IT NEEDS TO MAKE THIS THING
REALLY STAND OUT.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.156
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE MORE--

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:13.826
A LOT MORE BLACK IN THIS TATTOO
WOULD HAVE GONE A LONG WAY.

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:15.202
THIS IS SOMETHING
WHERE TATU BABY HAS

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.871
THAT STRENGTH OF PUTTING
THAT HEAVY BLACK IN THERE

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:21.917
AND MAKING HER COLORS STAND OUT,
AND MY MAIN COMPLAINT

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.879
ABOUT THIS IS THAT WHY
IS THE FACE SO LIFELESS?

01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:26.130
SHE DOESN'T LOOK--
IS SHE BORED?

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:28.382
IS SHE TIRED?
IS SHE SAD?

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:30.343
- NO, SHE'S LIKE ANGELIC.
- YOU KNOW?

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.511
- YOU KNOW, IT'S A MERMAID.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.512
EH, OVERALL
IT'S A VERY NICE TATTOO.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.389
I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.600
I'M HERE TO PICK IT APART
PIECE BY PIECE, AND YOU HAVE,

01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:40.436
YOU KNOW,
THESE LITTLE THINGS

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:44.940
THAT ARE VERY SHORT DISTANCE
FROM BEING GREAT, YOU KNOW,

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:48.152
AND THAT LITTLE SHORTCOMING
IS NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:49.904
- THANKS, OLLIE.

01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:51.072
CHRIS NUNEZ.

01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:52.406
- JOEY, LOOKING AT THIS TATTOO,

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:57.036
MAN, YOU PUT A LOT OF TIME
AND EFFORT INTO DOING THIS,

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.622
AND I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH OLIVER.

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:00.915
THE ONE THING THAT
WE'RE MISSING IN THIS

01:06:00.998 --> 01:06:04.377
IS WE'RE MISSING THAT RICH
CONTRAST, WHICH YOU DO SEE

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:08.214
IN TATU BABY'S TATTOO
BECAUSE OF THE USE OF BLACK.

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.883
WHAT I PICKED IMMEDIATELY
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS IS THAT

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.885
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAME COLOR,
WHETHER IT BE BLUE,

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:17.848
WHETHER IT BE FLESH-TONE,
WHAT THE COLOR MAY BE,

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.559
YOU'RE ONLY ONE SHADE OFF
FROM THE NEXT COLOR

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:24.105
AS IF YOU'RE PICKING IT
RIGHT OFF OF THE SHELF.

01:06:24.188 --> 01:06:26.023
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
MAKE THINGS POP,

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:28.067
AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
AND WILLING TO GO AHEAD

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:32.071
AND COMMIT TO THE PALETTE
THAT YOU'RE PICKING

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.239
AND GO AHEAD AND
USE THAT BLACK, MAN.

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.574
{\an1}- IN MY DEFENSE, THOUGH, IN--AND
A LOT OF THE UNDERWATER SCENES

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.785
THAT I DID RESEARCH
THAT BACKGROUND

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:40.579
IS JUST ONE SHADE OFF,
IN THE BACKGROUND,

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.956
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

01:06:42.039 --> 01:06:43.833
LIKE, AS A TATTOO, YES,
IT PROBABLY DIDN'T--

01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:45.251
NEEDED MORE CONTRAST,

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.837
AND I DID TRY AND GO
BACK IN AND ADD SOME BLACK

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.756
JUST TO ADD THE DEPTH SO IT LOOK
LIKE IT WAS--SHE WAS CLOSE

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.924
AND IT WAS FARTHER AWAY,
AND I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T--

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:54.135
- WHAT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR IN THIS--

01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:56.554
AND YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH FROM
BEING HERE FOR THIS MANY WEEKS

01:06:56.637 --> 01:06:59.432
AND FROM STANDING
IN THE SHOES YOU'RE STANDING IN,

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.517
IS SOMETHING THAT'S
GONNA POP, YOU KNOW?

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.729
THIS TATTOO
IS A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.063
IT JUST LACKS A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF "POP."

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.191
- ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:12.111
[applause]

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:19.410
- JIME, YOU'RE UP NEXT.

01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:21.412
LET'S BRING OUT
YOUR MASTER CANVAS.

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.706
- WOW.

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:27.126
[cheers and applause]

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.377
- LET'S HEAR FROM OLIVER.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:33.632
- WELL, JIME, Y'ALL DID REALLY
BIG, REALLY IMPRESSIVE TATTOOS.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.593
I REALLY LIKE
YOUR GAME PLAN ON THIS.

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:36.635
YOU WENT BIG, A WHOLE CHEST.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.929
YOU--THE WHOLE FRONT BODY.

01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:41.891
YOU WENT WITH A BIG TRADITIONAL
THEME OF BATTLE ROYALE.

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:45.728
I LIKE THE CONCEPT, BUT,
YOU KNOW--AND YOU DREW IT.

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.772
IT'S DEFINITELY--THAT'S YOUR
STYLE ALL OVER THIS THING.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:50.733
YOU NAILED IT AS FAR
AS DESIGNING IT.

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:53.319
THERE ARE SOME WEAK POINTS
IN THIS THING.

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.988
FOR ME, A BATTLE ROYALE
IS A BATTLE.

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.698
RIGHT HERE YOU HAVE
A BATTLE WITH NO BATTLE.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.159
THERE'S NO INTERACTION BETWEEN

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:03.162
ANY THREE OF THESE CHARACTERS
IN THIS SCENE.

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.165
THEY'RE JUST ALL CHILLING
NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.041
[laughter]
- YOU KNOW?

01:08:07.124 --> 01:08:09.710
AND IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'RE GONNA

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.921
FALL SHORT ON THE LAYOUT
A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT,

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:13.631
YOU NEED TO COME STRONG
WITH THE TATTOO,

01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:17.301
AND THIS THING DOESN'T HAVE THE
PUNCH THAT YOU NORMALLY HAVE.

01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:20.930
WHETHER YOU EXTENDED YOURSELF
TOO FAR TO COMMIT

01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:24.850
TO TOO MUCH TATTOOING OVER THIS
35 HOURS AND, YOU KNOW--

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.435
I'M GONNA LET NUNEZ TAKE OVER

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:28.312
WHEN IT COMES
TO THE BACKGROUND TALK,

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:31.314
BUT, YOU KNOW, A LOT
OF YOUR BLACK IS NOT SOLID.

01:08:31.398 --> 01:08:34.151
A LOT OF YOU--A LOT OF YOUR
COLORS DIDN'T HEAL OUT SMOOTH

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:37.029
FROM THE BLACK, AND THERE'S A
LOT OF WEAK AREAS IN THERE.

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:39.406
THIS IS--

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:43.368
I WANTED TO SEE
THE BEST TATTOOS THAT Y'ALL

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.955
HAVE EVER DONE FROM ALL THREE
OF YOU, AND I THINK THAT,

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:48.749
YOU KNOW, THIS GAME
IS IN YOUR HEAD, AND I THINK

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:51.210
THAT IT SHOWS IN EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF Y'ALL'S TATTOOS.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.711
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF PULL-BACK.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.130
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF
RESERVATION IN WHAT YOU DO

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.383
INSTEAD OF JUST GOING
BALLS TO THE WALL.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.634
- THANKS, OLLIE.

01:08:58.716 --> 01:08:59.885
- WELL, I MEAN, LIKE, I COULD
REALLY--YOU KNOW,

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:03.221
WITH THE DESIGN ITSELF,
IT'S MY TAKE ON IT.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.683
IT'S MY LIBERTY TO COME UP
WITH WHAT I FEEL IS,

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:06.433
LIKE, THE BATTLE
ROYALE.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:07.184
THE MEANING OF US
THREE COMPETING

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:08.060
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
LIKE THAT.

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:11.229
THERE IS INTERACTION
BETWEEN THE SNAKE,

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:12.189
THE DRAGON,
AND THE EAGLE.

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:13.816
IT'S NOT THE TRADITIONAL,
TYPICAL, YOU KNOW,

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.024
ALL CRAMMED
INTO ONE THING,

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:18.821
SO I JUST ALSO WANTED
TO TAKE THAT IMAGERY

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.698
BUT ADD MY TWIST TO IT.

01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:21.490
- OKAY, THANKS, JIME.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:22.992
- I THINK IT'S STILL
RECOGNIZABLE.

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:24.827
- LET'S HEAR FROM CHRIS.

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.912
- YOU KNOW, JIME,
YOU'VE IMPRESSED

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.413
THROUGHOUT THE COMPETITION.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.582
YOU'VE--YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
A STRONG, SOLID TATTOOER,

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.960
AND WITH THAT BEING SAID,

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:34.920
YOU AND I HAD
A CONVERSATION ONE DAY

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.046
WHEN WE WERE IN YOUR ROOM,
AND YOU WERE LIKE,

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.799
"MAN, THESE KIDS
NEED TO KNOW BETTER

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.216
"THAN TO BE PUTTING
ALL THAT BACKGROUND ON.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.676
"I DON'T PUT UNNECESSARY
BACKGROUND ON.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.595
I STAY AWAY FROM THAT,"

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.849
AND I THINK THAT YOU
OVER-THUNK

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:49.059
YOUR POSITION IN THIS.

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:52.645
THE BACKGROUND THAT YOU DID IN
HERE PROBABLY WAS UNNECESSARY,

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.941
AND YOUR STANDING OF JUST
DOING THREE SOLID IMAGES

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.693
AND DOING IT YOUR STYLE,
AFTER 20 PLUS YEARS

01:09:57.776 --> 01:10:00.988
OF TATTOOING IN THE STYLE

01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:03.198
THAT EVERYBODY'S KNOWN
TO GROW AND LOVE?

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:04.491
YOU DIDN'T DO.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.953
YOU ABANDONED YOUR STYLE IN THIS
PARTICULAR PIECE IN A SENSE,

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.288
AND I FEEL LIKE
THE CENTER SKULL

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:11.999
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU DID IT.

01:10:12.082 --> 01:10:14.668
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A JIME LITWALK SKULL.

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.003
- WELL, I WANTED TO COME
SHOW YOU VERSATILITY.

01:10:16.086 --> 01:10:17.379
I DIDN'T WANT TO
COME OUT WITH, LIKE--

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:20.132
MY STYLE IS WHAT GOT ME
STANDING HERE IN THIS POSITION,

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:21.550
AND I WANTED TO SHOW
MY VERSATILITY

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.719
TO SHOW YOU THAT
I CAN HOLD THAT TITLE.

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:25.930
- BUT THAT'S WHAT--THAT WAS
MY CONVERSATION WITH OLIVER,

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:28.641
WAS, "MAN, I THINK THAT
JIME TRIED TO PLAY

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:31.852
TO EVERY SENSE INSTEAD
OF STAYING IN JIME'S HEAD

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.812
AND DOING JIME,"
AND YOU DID DO JIME

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:38.817
THE ENTIRE COMPETITION,
BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR PIECE,

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.653
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
JIME WAS COMFORTABLE.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.821
- AND I GOT TO SAY, MAN...
- THANKS, CHRIS.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.198
- YOU DREW THIS THING
TO FIT THIS GUY'S BODY.

01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:47.826
WHY DIDN'T YOU DRAW THAT EAGLE
TO FIT THE CHEST?

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.828
THE FACT THAT THE WINGS
GO OFF AND DISAPPEAR

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.121
IN THE OTHER TATTOO,
AND YOU DON'T SEE THE SHAPE?

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:53.624
I THINK THAT'S A BIG DOWNFALL
FOR ME, TOO.

01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:55.834
- THANKS, GUYS.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.587
ALL RIGHT, WELL CONGRATULATIONS
TO ALL THREE OF YOU.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.214
YOU'VE ALL CREATED
INCREDIBLE WORK...

01:11:00.297 --> 01:11:01.256
[cheers and applause]

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:01.882
- BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL WALK AWAY

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.677
WITH THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.804
ALL RIGHT.

01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:11.642
GUYS, IS THERE A DECISION?

01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:14.812
[all whispering]

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:26.699
ALL RIGHT.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:30.786
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:33.914
TATU BABY, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:38.669
[cheers and applause]

01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:41.630
[audience members booing]

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:44.925
- OLLIE.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:48.304
- TATU, BABY. TATU BABY?
- BABY, HOLD UP. HOLD UP.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:51.515
- TATU BABY, I JUST WANT TO SAY
YOU REALLY, YOU KNOW,

01:11:51.598 --> 01:11:53.684
HAD A LOT OF TROUBLES
IN THIS COMPETITION,

01:11:53.767 --> 01:11:56.145
AND THIS--GOING THROUGH
THIS SEASON.

01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:57.479
THE FACT THAT
YOU MADE IT HERE,

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:58.313
THE FACT THAT YOU DID
THE FINAL TATTOO,

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.399
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
STANDING UP HERE

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.444
ABOVE ALL THESE
OTHER PEOPLE, CONGRATULATIONS.

01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:06.905
BY NO MEANS DID ANY THREE
OF Y'ALL DO A BAD TATTOO.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:10.242
IT'S JUST WE HAVE TO PICK IT
APART, AND LIKE MY MENTOR,

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:11.535
RICHARD STELL, SAYS,

01:12:11.618 --> 01:12:14.038
"ALL YOU HAVE IN THIS BUSINESS
IS YOUR REPUTATION,"

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:17.291
SO YOU WALK PROUD
WITH THAT.

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:20.419
- CHRIS, FINAL THOUGHT
FOR TATU BABY?

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:28.302
- YOU'VE MADE IT PROBABLY
FARTHER THAN ANYBODY.

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:30.304
YOU'VE TAKEN THE BALL
AND YOU'VE RUN WITH IT,

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:33.098
AND YOU HAVE FAN FAVORITES,
AND, YOU KNOW,

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.850
I THINK THAT THE PRESENCE
THAT YOU'VE CREATED

01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:39.271
FOR YOURSELF THROUGH GOOD AND
BAD TIMES WILL BY FAR EXCEED--

01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:43.192
BECAUSE YOU'RE HUMBLE,
BECAUSE OF THE HUMILITY,

01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:46.528
YOU WILL PASS ANYTHING,
AND THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.280
THAT WOULD BE PROUD
TO WORK WITH YOU

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:49.615
AND PROUD TO HAVE YOU BECAUSE

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:53.118
YOU HAVE A GREAT ATTITUDE
AND YOU DO GREAT TATTOOS.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.120
[cheers and applause]- THA.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.456
WE STARTED THE SEASON
WITH 16 ARTISTS,

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:00.542
AND NOW WE'RE DOWN
TO JUST TWO.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:05.547
{\an8}FIND OUT WHO WILL EARN
THE TITLE OF INK MASTER...NEXT.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:08.634
[cheers and applause]

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.724
[cheers and applause]

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:20.813
- HEY.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:21.897
- WELCOME BACK.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.192
ONE OF THESE TWO ARTISTS
IS INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO EARNING

01:13:25.275 --> 01:13:28.487
$100,000 AND THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:31.115
BUT FIRST, LET'S SEE
WHAT AN ARTIST

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:33.659
WHO WON AMERICA'S VOTE
HAS TO SAY.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:37.871
KYLE?
- YOU GUYS HAVE A HARD JOB.

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:42.126
LOOKING AT ALL THREE OF THOSE
TATTOOS I COULDN'T FIND

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:44.086
ANYTHING IMMEDIATELY
THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME AT ALL,

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:48.298
AND I LOVED TATU BABY'S.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.425
THEN, UH, BETWEEN THE TWO?

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:53.345
I CAN FIND SMALL,
LITTLE THINGS,

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.889
AND ON JOEY'S
I NOTICED THAT THE--

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:57.182
THAT LITTLE DIP
THAT COMES INTO YOUR NECK

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.350
RIGHT HERE I'M TOUCHING.

01:13:58.433 --> 01:14:01.687
IT'S KIND OF JUST OFF
A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW,

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.648
OR IT SEEMS TO BE,
AND THE BREAST SEEMED LIKE

01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:05.524
IT HAD AN ODD HIGHLIGHT ON IT.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:08.944
IT JUST MADE IT LOOK
A LITTLE BIT FUNNY.

01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:10.112
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE DO HAVE A HARD JOB.

01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:12.239
- YOU GUYS HAVE
AN AMAZINGLY HARD JOB.

01:14:12.322 --> 01:14:15.909
EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU GET UP
THERE--THEY DO.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:17.035
IT'S--YOU GOT TO STAND
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:20.622
AND TELL 'EM SOMETHING ISN'T
GOOD WHEN--IT'S NOT EASY.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:21.707
IT'S NOT EASY.
- NO.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.501
- IT'S WHAT I RUN AWAY FROM
AT CON--AT CONVENTIONS.

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:26.837
- WE'D LOVE TO BE NICE GUYS AND
TELL EVERYBODY THEY'RE GREAT,

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.715
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:30.716
- JIME'S TATTOO SEEMED TO BE
FLAT TO SOME EXTENT,

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.926
LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
WITH THE BACKGROUND.

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.345
I CAN PRETTY MUCH ONLY ECHO THE
THINGS THAT YOU GUYS ARE SAYING.

01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:38.891
IT SEEMED LIKE
THE BLACK BACKGROUND

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.852
AND MAYBE TOO MUCH BLACK?

01:14:41.935 --> 01:14:44.396
I DON'T--I'M SO CONFUSED.

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.648
[laughter]
- ALL RIGHT.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:47.733
WELL, LET'S HEAR
FROM OLIVER AND CHRIS.

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:51.528
GUYS, WHAT ARE YOUR FINAL
THOUGHTS ON JIME'S TATTOO?

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:52.905
OLLIE?

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.407
- JIME, I KNOW--
I TRY TO, YOU KNOW,

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.451
LOOK AT THAT TATTOO AND PICK IT
APART AS MUCH AS I COULD,

01:14:57.534 --> 01:14:59.578
BUT OVERALL, MAN,
IT IS A BIG, BADASS TATTOO.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:03.790
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S GOT YOUR NAME ALL OVER IT.

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:04.666
ANYBODY THAT KNOWS YOUR WORK

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.211
IS GONNA SEE THAT
AND BE STOKED ON IT.

01:15:07.294 --> 01:15:09.505
THE GUY THAT'S WEARING IT IS
GONNA BE STOKED ON IT FOREVER.

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:11.381
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAME TO COMPETE.

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:14.968
YOU STUCK TRUE TO YOURSELF
THE WHOLE COMPETITION.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.970
YOU WERE VERY HONORABLE
IN THE WAY YOU REACTED

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.555
WITH YOUR FELLOW
COMPETITORS,

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.767
AND ALL THAT
IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.435
IT COMES DOWN
TO THIS LAST TATTOO.

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:25.437
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE--

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.232
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST
TATTOO YOU'VE EVER DONE.

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.733
IS IT?

01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:32.486
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I DO LIKE IT A LOT.

01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:35.656
LIKE I SAID, THERE'S THINGS
ABOUT IT THAT--

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:38.075
HERE AND THERE,
BUT OVERALL, MAN, IT'S BAD.

01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:39.117
IT'S BAD TO THE BONE.

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.536
- THANKS.
- I'M STOKED.

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:41.662
- THANK YOU.
- CHRIS.

01:15:41.745 --> 01:15:44.623
[cheers and applause]

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:50.087
- JIME, ALL THROUGH
THIS COMPETITION,

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.798
MAN, YOU'VE EXCELLED.
YOU'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW--

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:58.178
BOTH OF YOU GUYS, YOU'VE LED
THE PACK, AND WITH GOOD REASON.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:00.472
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A WELL-KNOWN
NAME IN THIS BUSINESS.

01:16:00.555 --> 01:16:04.226
YOU'RE A GUY THAT ANYBODY
WHO OWNS A SHOP OR ANYBODY

01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:05.811
THAT ASPIRES TO BE
A BETTER TATTOOER

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:08.021
WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK--
BE WORKING AROUND.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:08.939
YOU KNOW?

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:10.399
IT'S A GREAT THING
TO SEE SOMEBODY GREAT

01:16:10.482 --> 01:16:14.194
END UP AT THE TOP,
AND AGAINST THIS FIELD

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.446
YOU ENDED UP EXACTLY WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW?

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:21.868
AS FAR AS THIS TATTOO,
IT WAS THE--

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:24.371
IT WAS THE TATTOO I NEEDED
YOU TO JUST SEND HOME.

01:16:24.454 --> 01:16:25.372
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

01:16:25.455 --> 01:16:28.000
I NEEDED TO BANG IT.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:29.418
I'M HAPPY.
I'M HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY

01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:32.838
THAT A REAL TATTOOER
IS STANDING UP HERE

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.757
AND THAT YOU'VE LEFT YOUR
MARK FOREVER ON THE INDUSTRY.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:38.719
YOUR FANS WILL ALWAYS BE HAPPY
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:39.720
- THANKS, CHRIS.

01:16:39.803 --> 01:16:40.721
[cheers and applause]

01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:45.142
LET ME HEAR YOUR FINAL
THOUGHTS ON JOEY'S PIECE.

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:48.729
- JOEY, AGAIN, MAN.

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:51.523
YOU--LIKE I SAID, YOU DID
THIS BIG TATTOO ON THIS LEG.

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.442
IT IS VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.

01:16:53.525 --> 01:16:55.777
THIS SHOWS VERSATILITY.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.113
I THINK EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE
THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION

01:16:58.196 --> 01:17:00.824
SHOWED THAT YOU WERE VERSATILE.

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:02.034
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A LOT OF LITTLE AREAS

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.785
IN THIS TATTOO
THAT WE CAN GO THROUGH

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:07.372
YOUR COMPETITION AND PICK OUT
WHAT THINGS YOU DID

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.333
THROUGHOUT THE COMPETITION THAT
CAME THROUGH IN THIS TATTOO.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:13.211
THE TURTLE, THE DETAIL,
THE SOLID, YOU KNOW--

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.422
THE SOLID
SATURATION OF COLOR.

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:16.715
THE--JUST A NICE, SMOOTH,

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:21.887
EVEN LAYING OF LIGHT COLORS
VERSUS DARK COLORS.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.722
I WISH THERE WAS MORE BLACK
IN THIS THING.

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.974
I WISH IT WAS MORE VIBRANT,

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:27.059
BUT THE GIRL
THAT'S WEARING THIS,

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:29.561
SHE DOES HAVE PROBABLY
THE BEST TATTOO YOU EVER DID.

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:33.565
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A BIG,
AMAZING PIECE OF WORK.

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:37.069
IT'S A REALLY TOUGH CALL.

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:40.572
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE--
THIS IS THE HARDEST CRITIQUE--

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:41.615
THE HARDEST TWO CHOICE
WE'VE HAD TO PICK

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.493
OUT OF THIS WHOLE
INK MASTER DEAL, MAN.

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:46.036
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE ONE--

01:17:46.119 --> 01:17:48.747
THE BIGGEST TATTOOS WE'VE HAD
TO CRITIQUE SO FAR,

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:49.998
AND IT'S DOWN, RIGHT HERE,
LIVE ON STAGE.

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:52.876
TWO PEOPLE. WHO WINS?
- CHRIS?

01:17:52.959 --> 01:17:55.212
