REGARDING THAT MASK.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.916
Anne: TRULY, CAN THIS WAIT?

42:37.950 --> 42:41.784
Mr. Hale:
IT HAS WAITED LONG ENOUGH.

42:41.820 --> 42:44.357
AND IT IS THIS --

42:44.390 --> 42:48.690
THAT THE POWER OF THAT MASK

42:48.730 --> 42:52.791
CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED
BY THOSE OF ONE KIND.

42:52.830 --> 42:56.596
Anne: AND WHAT KIND IS THAT?

42:56.640 --> 42:58.767
Mr. Hale: MY KIND.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.501
Anne: BUT IT WORKED WHEN I...

43:05.850 --> 43:07.772
ARE YOU SAYING THAT I AM...

43:07.810 --> 43:09.846
Mr. Hale: LIKE ME.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.487
A WITCH.
