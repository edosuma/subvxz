00:03.003 --> 00:04.265
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...

00:04.395 --> 00:05.744
- Deputy Mayor Sharpe.
- I'm an asset to you.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.398
I could help you
with the mayor.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.270
I could help you with
a variety of people.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.836
It's called setting up
for success.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.274
I've gotten Ruskin Gardens
to provide us with

00:13.404 --> 00:15.798
- two one-bedroom apartments.
- I'll do it.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.669
Why'd you volunteer
to do this, Quinlan?

00:17.800 --> 00:19.628
I grew up in
Section Eight housing

00:19.758 --> 00:21.499
with a drug addict mother.

00:21.630 --> 00:24.241
And when I was 15, I ran away
and I lived on the streets,

00:24.372 --> 00:25.982
and I didn't consider myself
part of any community.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.418
When we first got
on the job,

00:27.549 --> 00:29.464
we had to eat every
insult, offence...

00:29.594 --> 00:31.944
Sometimes I feel like...

00:32.075 --> 00:33.729
we haven't made any
progress at all.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.905
Those stars on your collar say
there's been plenty of progress.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.212
<i>You know, back when I was on
the Warrant Squad with Desmond,</i>

00:38.342 --> 00:39.648
his gut told him
the Selkirk brothers

00:39.778 --> 00:40.692
had gone out of state.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.433
By the time we picked him up

00:42.564 --> 00:44.044
he'd killed, what, two
more people? Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:44.174 --> 00:45.219

I know you all are
starting work today,

01:10.853 --> 01:12.376
but anyone who needs to be

01:12.507 --> 01:14.074
moved from this site
Will be moved by us.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.424
If you put your hands
on any of these people

01:16.554 --> 01:19.122
or their belongings,
you will be subject to arrest.

01:21.994 --> 01:25.172
Folks, they're going to break
ground on this site today,

01:25.302 --> 01:29.306
and we have to ask you to move
and go somewhere else, okay?

01:29.437 --> 01:31.003
Somewhere else where?

01:31.134 --> 01:33.919
There's a list of nearby
shelters and temporary housing

01:34.050 --> 01:35.747
that we'll provide you with.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.488
What about my dog?

01:37.619 --> 01:39.273
We'll see if there's a place
that'll let you bring your dog.

01:39.403 --> 01:42.058
Okay? The Trumans,
whom some of you may know,

01:42.189 --> 01:43.799
they've been running
the food pantry

01:43.929 --> 01:44.887
at St. Abigail's.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.628
They're providing box lunches

01:46.758 --> 01:49.152
to anyone who wants one.

01:49.283 --> 01:52.242
Uh, raise your hands, Trumans,
so they know where you are.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.722
Over there, okay?

01:53.852 --> 01:54.940
Nadia Nye from
<i>All New York News.</i>

01:55.071 --> 01:56.377
- Could I get a statement?
- Yeah.

01:56.507 --> 01:58.944
There's been an encampment
at this location

01:59.075 --> 02:00.729
for quite some time now,

02:00.859 --> 02:01.860
and the people
who have been here,

02:01.991 --> 02:03.253
they've been calling this home.

02:03.384 --> 02:06.300
At the same time,
this is private property,

02:06.430 --> 02:07.910
and they're here without
permission from the owner,

02:08.040 --> 02:11.348
so we're respectfully asking
that they all move on from here

02:11.479 --> 02:12.654
and go somewhere else.

02:12.784 --> 02:13.655
Why are you always
talking about

02:13.785 --> 02:14.743
"somewhere else"?

02:14.873 --> 02:16.397
There ain't no somewhere else.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.574
We understand... Uh, Inspector Haywood,

02:19.704 --> 02:21.576
if I might interject something?

02:21.706 --> 02:24.753
The way to handle
the problem of homelessness

02:24.883 --> 02:26.407
is to build more homes.

02:26.537 --> 02:27.973
That's what you're seeing
happening here today.

02:28.104 --> 02:29.627
Affordable homes?

02:29.758 --> 02:31.716
A significant percentage
of them will be affordable.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.371
- The mayor's committed to that.
- Excuse me.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.548
No, I don't have, I don't have
time to go through everything.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.029
I understand. We just want
- to help you with your things.
- Yeah.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.684
Okay, just put everything
in there

02:42.814 --> 02:44.294
and I'll go through it
- later, okay?
- Don't worry,

02:44.425 --> 02:46.078
we'll help you out.
All right?

02:46.209 --> 02:47.471
All right, just...
you know, careful.

02:47.602 --> 02:48.820
- This is everything.
- We will be.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.909
- What's your name?
- May.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.825
Ah, you got a <i>Charlie's Angels</i> poster.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.610
Yeah, I do.

02:55.740 --> 02:56.698
Who's your favorite angel?

02:56.828 --> 02:58.134
Gotta be Lucy Liu, right?

02:58.265 --> 02:59.875
- Shelly Hack.
- Oh...

03:00.005 --> 03:01.485
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.183
All right.
There's a Starlight

03:03.313 --> 03:05.141
Motor Lodge over there
on Cross Bay Boulevard.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.969
Tell 'em I sent you there.
They'll let you keep your dog.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.189
- I still get my box lunch?
- Come on.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.714
Coming through, you guys.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.151
Hey, Henry,
let's help over here.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.413
Take-- Whoops.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.895
Tamika?

03:23.594 --> 03:25.117
Hey, Marvin.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.728
Since when are you
back in Brooklyn?

03:26.858 --> 03:28.251
Since about two years ago.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.470
That's-that's crazy.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.907
Hi, would you like
a lunch box?

03:32.037 --> 03:34.126
- Is it?
- I mean, I didn't know
you were back.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.693
Um, no way you would, right?

03:35.824 --> 03:38.305
Here you go, sweetheart.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.567
But you're good, though, right?

03:39.697 --> 03:41.308
I'm fine.
How about yourself?

03:41.438 --> 03:42.831
Yeah, fine. Good.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.706
I, um... Nice to see you.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.108
<i>My neighbors were
playing their music until</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:00.544
00 in the morning.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.025
And that super. I had
to call him three times

04:03.155 --> 04:04.461
to come and fix
the hot water.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.376
Wow.
And your cousin

04:06.507 --> 04:09.640
is sending me information
about places in Yonkers again.

04:09.771 --> 04:13.340
- Okay.
- She says it's because
she's worried about me here.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.211
Really it's so she doesn't
have to listen

04:15.342 --> 04:16.604
to Conchetta complain.

04:18.475 --> 04:19.868
I mean...

04:19.998 --> 04:21.130
it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world

04:21.261 --> 04:23.698
for you to live in Yonkers.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.047
Don't you start with this.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.049
Well, seriously...

04:27.179 --> 04:30.182
where Conchetta lives,
it is safer.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.141
I'm safe enough.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.274
<i>Bueno.</i>

04:34.404 --> 04:36.319
Okay.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.844
This one, that's to
turn the TV on,

04:39.975 --> 04:41.324
and that's for the cable.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.065
Two remotes, Johnny?

04:43.195 --> 04:44.762
Why?
Ah, ah. I don't know.
I don't know, Ma.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.721
That's... that's the only way
that I can make it work.

04:46.851 --> 04:47.765
Ah.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.644
Isaac? Isaac!

04:59.516 --> 05:01.475
Excuse me,
you seen a little boy?

05:02.911 --> 05:05.261
Isaac!

05:05.392 --> 05:06.523
I don't know where
my son is.

05:06.654 --> 05:07.785
He was here,
and now he's not here.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.221
And I don't know
where he is.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.049
- Okay, how old is he?
- He's ten.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.703
Is it possible he went
over to the park?

05:12.834 --> 05:14.705
- My husband lives in the park.
- Okay, okay. It's okay.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.751
- Does he have a phone?
- I called it, like, 30 times.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.056
Okay, let me let
my sergeant know,

05:18.187 --> 05:19.362
and we'll put out word
that he's missing.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.798
- Thank you.
- Okay? It's gonna be okay.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.932
Isaac?

05:24.062 --> 05:25.977
Isaac, baby!

05:28.980 --> 05:31.113
You're always talking
to me like that.

05:31.243 --> 05:32.680
I don't know, shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.290
- Shut up.
- Why you always telling me
to shut up?

05:34.421 --> 05:35.770
- Listen, listen.
- What?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.119
You think you're gonna
make problems

05:37.249 --> 05:38.860
and I ain't gonna
do nothing about it?

05:38.990 --> 05:40.078
You're the one who makes your
problems, you stupid bastard.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.645
- Come on, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:41.776 --> 05:43.778
- This doesn't concern you.
- I'm a police officer.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.693
You cannot be hitting her.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.434
- How 'bout what she did?
- Get your hands... Step away.

05:47.564 --> 05:48.609
You see what you... What I did?

05:48.739 --> 05:50.480
Yeah. Listen.
No, no, no.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.394
Get your hands against the car!

05:51.525 --> 05:53.222
Spread your legs.
Spread your legs.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.658
Ma'am, I'm gonna tell you
step back, step back.

05:54.789 --> 05:55.964
I'm standing right here.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.444
- Hey, come on.
- What is that?

05:57.574 --> 05:58.706
- Man, come on.
- What is this?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.272
Come on, give him a break.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.709
See, now we're in
a whole different thing, man.

06:01.839 --> 06:02.971
Come on, he didn't
do nothing. Come on.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.364
Hands on the car.
Bring that hand down.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.191
- Listen. Listen to me.
- Please step back.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.323
I told you he didn't do nothing.
- Come on. Come on.
- Ma'am!

06:07.454 --> 06:09.194
I said step back!
Easy.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.327
I asked you to step away.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.024
Don't you move.

06:13.155 --> 06:14.374
I'm a police officer.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.985
Can one of you manage
to call 911?

06:17.115 --> 06:19.901
I'm telling you, man... Don't move. Don't move.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.865
Recent picture?
Last week.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.261
We got a ping on the phone.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.527
Chester?

06:37.658 --> 06:38.833
Where's the phone?

06:38.963 --> 06:40.051
What?

06:40.182 --> 06:42.271
Where is the phone?

06:47.232 --> 06:49.583
That's Isaac's phone.
Those are his stickers.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.498
- Where'd you get this?
- I found it on the ground.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.717
Please tell us
- where he is.
- Who?

06:53.848 --> 06:55.850
Just tell us where
- our son is.
- I don't know where he is.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.374
- I found it over there.
- You come to our
food pantry, man.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.201
Where over there?

06:59.331 --> 07:01.508
Stairs to the subway.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.355
Hey, Morales.

07:23.486 --> 07:27.751
Hey, look, last time
I saw you I was a real jerk.

07:27.882 --> 07:30.754
I've been going through some
things, but that's no excuse.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.714
I'm sorry.
We're on the same team.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.066
Homicide from last year. You?

07:38.196 --> 07:40.895
Pattern robbery.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.549
Took me a month
to make the case.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.072
Hey, good for you.

07:44.202 --> 07:47.031
Thanks. Your support means
so much to me.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.903
See ya, Troy.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.383
Prepped and ready to go,
Officer Quinlan?

07:51.514 --> 07:53.516
No one will ever know it's
your first time testifying.

07:53.647 --> 07:54.822
My part's pretty easy.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.693
It's a good collar, Detective.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.956
Officer Quinlan just has to
answer a few simple questions,

07:59.087 --> 08:00.131
and we're home.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.959
Let's go.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.748
So what do we know about
this guy who found the phone?

08:07.878 --> 08:09.489
All right,
name's Chester Pruitt.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.969
Honorably discharged
from the Navy in 2005.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.756
He took a vagrancy collar
in 2015, another one in 2019,

08:15.886 --> 08:17.497
another in 2020.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.455
We don't like him for snatching
this kid, though, do we?

08:19.586 --> 08:21.239
Well, Officer Aziz was talking
to him right around the time

08:21.370 --> 08:23.111
the kid was snatched,
and we don't have a record

08:23.241 --> 08:24.982
of him doing anything
like it before.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.636
I get the impression
he just picked up the phone.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.246
Sex offender registry?

08:28.377 --> 08:29.900
Well, we're cross-checking
with anyone in the area

08:30.031 --> 08:31.815
who've had contact
with the police,

08:31.946 --> 08:34.209
and also anyone who's working
or staying at nearby shelters.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.558
What about the parents?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.517
No, no, there's, uh, no case

08:37.647 --> 08:39.083
of child abuse or neglect.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.651
And I'm also out to ACS
for a records check.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.392
We have all sectors canvassing.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.047
Let's just hope we get lucky.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.701
Yeah.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.792
Yeah.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.679
Hi, there.

09:09.810 --> 09:10.811
Y'all seen this kid
right here?

09:12.987 --> 09:13.988
Mm-mm.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.251
No, I ain't seen him.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.122
Thank you.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.602
First few hours is critical
with a missing kid.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.386
He went down in the subway,
he could be anywhere.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.475
Do you right away start
thinking sex trafficking?

09:23.606 --> 09:25.303
Nope, let's don't even
say those words, okay?

09:25.434 --> 09:27.523
No, but I mean... Of course I start thinking it,

09:27.654 --> 09:29.438
but let's not speak on it
till we need to, okay?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.353
Okay.

09:31.483 --> 09:32.876
You knew that woman
who was giving out box lunches.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.096
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.663
Seemed like you knew her.'Cause I did know her.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.752
- I just said I know her.
- All right, Marvin.

09:38.882 --> 09:39.970
I just asked.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.581
Used to live
together, okay?

09:41.711 --> 09:43.017
Okay.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.672
I didn't expect to
run into her today.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.936
But when you ask me
did I know her...

09:49.066 --> 09:50.981
yeah, I know her.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.983
You see
the construction workers?

09:53.114 --> 09:54.506
Okay, now, zoom in on them

09:54.637 --> 09:55.856
putting the furniture
inside the dumpster.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.162
You're Nadia Nye.
Uh-huh.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.034
Yeah, I watch you
all the time.
Thank you.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.862
Think it might be possible
for our detectives

10:01.992 --> 10:03.254
to take a look at
some of that video

10:03.385 --> 10:04.560
that you shot this morning?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.170
We only do that
under subpoena.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.737
We're looking for a ten-year-old
kid who's gone missing.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.739
Turning over footage
isn't really up to me.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.349
That's up to
the executive producer.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.134
Obviously.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.049
The thing that
we're worried about

10:15.179 --> 10:18.008
is, uhm, sex trafficking.

10:24.188 --> 10:27.104
I'm gonna tell them you said
it was a police emergency.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.758
Tell 'em whatever you want.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.376
The night of April 27,
you got a call

10:38.507 --> 10:40.814
from Detective Morales,
did you not?

10:40.944 --> 10:42.163
Yes, I did.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.686
What was the nature
of that call?

10:43.817 --> 10:45.688
She told me that her
confidential informant

10:45.819 --> 10:49.083
had advised her that a suspect
in a string of armed robberies

10:49.213 --> 10:51.563
had just hit an apartment
building on Pitkin Avenue.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.609
Detective Morales was
in the Bronx at that point,

10:53.740 --> 10:56.220
so she sent me a photograph
of the suspect

10:56.351 --> 10:58.005
and asked if I could
pick him up.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.833
- And did you do so?
- Yes.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.052
I identified the individual
from the photograph,

11:02.183 --> 11:04.402
and I stopped and detained him.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.404
At which point, we then found

11:06.535 --> 11:09.886
several articles of jewelry
within his pockets.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.367
I then transported him
to the 7-4 precinct,

11:12.497 --> 11:14.978
where I turned him over
to Detective Morales.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.198
Do you see that individual
in the courtroom?

11:17.328 --> 11:19.200
Yes, he's right there.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.899
No further questions.

11:27.164 --> 11:30.515
Did the defendant inform you
that he was a heroin addict

11:30.646 --> 11:31.342
at that time?

11:31.473 --> 11:33.257
I believe he did, yes.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.129
That have any effect on you?

11:35.259 --> 11:37.000
I felt for him.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.698
Ah. Did you feel
for your mother?

11:38.828 --> 11:41.135
Objection. Irrelevant.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.658
Excuse me?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.312
Ask to be given a chance
to demonstrate relevance.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.401
Demonstrate it quickly.

11:46.531 --> 11:49.056
Your mother goes by the name
Ann-Marie Quinlan?

11:49.186 --> 11:51.798
Your Honor... Yes, yeah, that's her name. Right.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.017
Counsel, approach.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.587
Where are you going
with this, Counselor?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.458
The witness made
an identification

12:00.589 --> 12:02.504
based on a photograph, she says.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.594
I'm entitled to challenge
that identification

12:05.725 --> 12:07.335
by demonstrating that
once my client admitted

12:07.465 --> 12:08.815
he was a drug addict,

12:08.945 --> 12:11.034
based on Officer Quinlan's
personal history,

12:11.165 --> 12:14.255
she was gonna search him with or
without reasonable justification

12:14.385 --> 12:15.996
and arrest him with
or without probable cause.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.563
You can't actually think that
that's what happened.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.001
- Officer.
- You're just mouthing
it is whatever lawyers

12:21.131 --> 12:22.437
are supposed to say.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.221
You don't actually believe
that's the truth.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.614
- Officer Quinlan!
- And because it gives you
something to say,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.094
so then you dig up dirt
on my mother?

12:27.224 --> 12:28.356
But it has absolutely
nothing to do

12:28.486 --> 12:29.357
- with any of this?
- Officer Quinlan!

12:29.487 --> 12:32.273
Officer Quinlan,

12:32.403 --> 12:34.971
one more word and I will
hold you in contempt.

12:35.102 --> 12:38.540
The jury will disregard
the witness's outburst

12:38.670 --> 12:40.455
in its entirety.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.631
We stand in recess
till 3:00 this afternoon,

12:42.762 --> 12:46.635
at which time Mr. Parcell will
resume his cross-examination,

12:46.766 --> 12:47.941
and the witness will

12:48.071 --> 12:50.117
maintain her composure.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.388
Get out of my way.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.049
<i>The guy who found
the kid's phone</i>

13:09.179 --> 13:11.094
alibied out, and the cameras
over at Wyckoff Station

13:11.225 --> 13:12.530
don't work.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.749
We're still waiting
on the cross-check

13:13.880 --> 13:15.446
from the sex
offender registry.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.275
Inspector,
Deputy Mayor Sharpe. Sure.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.016
You, my friend,
have a problem.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.670
What's that?

13:21.801 --> 13:22.802
That incident you got
involved in this morning?

13:22.932 --> 13:24.064
It's all over Twitter.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.021
WOMAN [phone video]:
Come on...

13:25.152 --> 13:27.894
Come on... Come on...

13:28.024 --> 13:29.809
Come on... Come on...

13:29.939 --> 13:31.549
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.682
I'm leaving
my mother's building.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.466
Two people were having
a domestic dispute.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.512
Turned into a gun collar.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.556
The problem is,
it looks like

13:38.687 --> 13:40.689
you threw this girl
to the ground, hard.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.734
We should see if
other videos exist.

13:42.865 --> 13:43.997
Come on!

13:44.127 --> 13:45.433
Hey, we got footage
of the kid

13:45.563 --> 13:46.695
from <i>All New York News,</i> Inspector.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.653
- You gotta see this.
- Yeah.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.568
Come on! Come on!

13:50.699 --> 13:53.571
This looks bad, Chief.
Looks real bad.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.403
All right,
it's all time-stamped.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.144
The kid was with his parents
before this.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.059
It's cued up to
when he's unaccounted for.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.671
That's him.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.936
Wait, wait. Who's-who's that?

14:10.066 --> 14:10.980
He was hanging
around the food pantry

14:11.111 --> 14:12.155
the last time we were there.

14:12.286 --> 14:13.765
His name is Henry something.

14:17.639 --> 14:18.901
Talk to the Isaac's parents.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.860
They may know
where to find Henry.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.123
We need to find this boy before
something bad happens to him.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.473
I want all the sector cars
to have a description of Henry.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.605
Have Transit keep
checking the subway.

14:27.736 --> 14:28.780
Just keep checking.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.014
Come in.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.278
Chief.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.193
We need to have a little chat,
you and me.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.369
Absolutely.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.936
What the hell happened
this morning?

14:56.460 --> 14:58.898
I'd been to see my mother,
and as I was leaving,

14:59.028 --> 15:01.726
I saw two people engaged
in a domestic dispute.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.424
The video has you
clocking this girl.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.948
She looks like
she's 110 pounds dripping wet.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.297
Chief, she came at me.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.953
As I was taking a gun
off her boyfriend.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.520
I didn't clock her.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.000
I pushed her back
so I could deal with the gun.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.349
I'm not standing
in judgment, John,

15:15.479 --> 15:16.524
but this isn't gonna go away

15:16.654 --> 15:18.352
by itself.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.310
- I understand.
- You're a borough commander.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.486
What the hell are you getting
involved with this nonsense for?

15:22.617 --> 15:24.575
The guy hit her
while I was standing there.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.229
I didn't really feel like
I had much choice.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.796
Well, see if you feel
the same way

15:27.927 --> 15:28.928
when you're on the front page
of the <i>Post.</i>

15:29.058 --> 15:30.842
Internal Affairs has it.

15:30.973 --> 15:31.931
They're conferring
with the commissioner

15:32.061 --> 15:33.802
to decide what's gonna happen.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.586
Whatever they
come back with,

15:35.717 --> 15:37.327
I'm concerned about what
it's gonna do to you long-term.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.676
Whatever it looks like,

15:38.807 --> 15:40.678
I know what I did
was not out of line.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.898
If you're talking about
moving up in the Department,

15:43.029 --> 15:44.900
getting a third star
on your shoulder,

15:45.031 --> 15:47.598
what it looks like
is what it is.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.045
Can I...
can I have my camera back?

15:59.175 --> 16:00.742
As soon as you answer
some questions.

16:00.872 --> 16:04.398
It's making me agitated
that I don't have my camera.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.053
Where did you and Isaac go,
Henry?

16:09.098 --> 16:10.447
It's a simple question.

16:10.578 --> 16:11.709
It's a simple question to ask

16:11.840 --> 16:13.494
if I can have my camera back.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.887
We have video of the two of you
walking off together.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.237
Now, are you gonna tell me
it didn't happen,

16:17.367 --> 16:18.194
or are you gonna help me out
here?

16:24.896 --> 16:26.986
Look, I'm not gonna hit you.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.075
Just tell me where you went.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.641
Killian's going about this
all wrong.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.121
This is not how you communicate

16:32.252 --> 16:33.818
with a kid
who's on the spectrum.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.777
Do you have any experience
in this regard?

16:35.907 --> 16:38.084
I'm not claiming to be
an authority here... I know that.

16:38.214 --> 16:41.261
...but I think that we should be
more adaptive, don't you?

16:41.391 --> 16:43.393
Okay, I think it's worth a shot.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.482
I feel like everyone's saying
I did something wrong.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.322
I think this might need
a different approach, Detective.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.889
Okay, well,
what kind of approach?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.021
We need to meet him
where he is.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.587
What does that mean?

17:03.718 --> 17:06.025
It means we're letting
Captain Yenko talk to him.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.289
Yes.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.247
Be my guest.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.390
Hello, Henry.
My name is Stan.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.220
Are you above the other guy,
or is he above you?

17:27.350 --> 17:28.525
Well, no,
I guess I'm above him,

17:28.656 --> 17:31.224
but the Police Department
is organized

17:31.354 --> 17:32.573
a little differently than that.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.879
Can-can you get my camera back?

17:47.196 --> 17:48.676
Can't you do this without me?

17:48.806 --> 17:50.721
It's your case,
what do you even need me for?

17:50.852 --> 17:52.288
You establish chain of custody

17:52.419 --> 17:53.985
for what he had on him
when he was arrested.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.988
You establish probable
cause to search him.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.294
Without you,
there's no case.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.737
This happen to you every time
someone mentions your mother?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.087
No.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.175
What is it, then?

18:09.305 --> 18:11.133
The courtroom setting?

18:11.264 --> 18:12.613
Mentioning your
mother in there?

18:12.743 --> 18:14.571
Since you're asking, yeah.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.184
My mother was arrested
for drug possession

18:18.314 --> 18:19.576
for the fourth time,

18:19.707 --> 18:22.449
and her lawyer thought that

18:22.579 --> 18:24.103
it would make her seem
more sympathetic

18:24.233 --> 18:25.930
if I was in the courtroom
during sentencing.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.715
I was 11 years old.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.371
I guess you could say
it left a mark.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.723
I heard when Haywood asked
for volunteers

18:35.853 --> 18:38.334
to live in public housing,
your hand shot straight up.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.510
Right.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.251
Didn't hesitate.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.340
Didn't think about what
it would be like to be a cop

18:44.471 --> 18:45.950
living in
the projects.

18:46.081 --> 18:46.995
If you can do that,

18:47.126 --> 18:48.388
you can make this right.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.129
How am I supposed to do that?

18:51.913 --> 18:53.262
Ask yourself if some guy

18:53.393 --> 18:54.916
who breaks into
people's apartments

18:55.046 --> 18:56.439
in the middle of the night,
ties them up

18:56.570 --> 18:58.528
and robs them blind
deserves to be

18:58.659 --> 18:59.616
back on the street.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.009
Of course he doesn't.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.404
We're cops.

19:04.534 --> 19:08.712
Every day, we separate our
professional from our personal.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.324
And that is it.

19:11.454 --> 19:15.458
So do that and
put this scumbag away.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.644
<i>We have reason to believe</i>

19:27.775 --> 19:29.516
that Henry has Isaac.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.909
Henry would not do this.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.520
Honey, they have the two of them
leaving together.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.217
We don't know where they went.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.219
Them leaving together might
have been totally innocent.

19:37.350 --> 19:38.655
It's got to be somebody else.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.788
Henry loves Isaac.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.311
He would never hold him
against his will.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.660
He would never keep him

19:43.791 --> 19:45.096
from getting in touch with us.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.838
I don't know what he'd do.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.580
Can I talk to you for a second,
Inspector?

19:50.711 --> 19:52.321
Okay. Yeah.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.149
I will be right back.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.501
So, am I still working
on this missing kid case ,

19:58.632 --> 19:59.807
or should I just
remove myself entirely?

19:59.937 --> 20:02.940
What do you have for me,
Detective?

20:03.071 --> 20:04.768
A few months ago,
someone tried to grab a kid

20:04.899 --> 20:06.596
outside of an elementary school.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.382
Now, Morales brought a guy named
Lloyd Turner in for questioning.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.384
He's a registered sex offender.

20:11.514 --> 20:12.950
You talk to Morales?

20:13.081 --> 20:14.561
Just now.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.127
Lloyd Turner works
in the food pantry

20:16.258 --> 20:17.390
at Saint Abigail's.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.480
Bring him in, right now.
Right now.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.102
Got your camera.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.017
You know, Detective Killian
wasn't trying

20:36.147 --> 20:37.627
to be mean to you.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.151
It's just... we're not allowed
to have cameras

20:40.282 --> 20:42.241
inside the interview room.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.765
It might not be as important
to other people as it is to me.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.636
I understand.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.943
How long do I have
to stay here?

20:49.073 --> 20:49.944
I don't know.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.250
Who does know?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.034
Well, everybody's worried

20:53.164 --> 20:54.775
'cause they don't know
where Isaac is.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.386
- Do you know where he is?
- No. No.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.781
You know where
the last place you saw him was?

21:00.911 --> 21:02.130
Yeah.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.523
Can you tell me?

21:03.653 --> 21:06.439
415 Knickerbocker Avenue.

21:07.744 --> 21:10.051
- Well, that's your place, Henry.
- Yeah.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.880
Uh, Isaac walked me from
where the homeless people were

21:13.010 --> 21:15.099
because I didn't want to
be there anymore,

21:15.230 --> 21:16.927
because it was sad.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.407
Why was it sad?

21:18.538 --> 21:20.148
You don't think it's sad that

21:20.279 --> 21:22.759
people put all their things
into a shopping cart

21:22.890 --> 21:25.066
because they have
to move away,

21:25.196 --> 21:27.677
because they can't even sleep
in a vacant lot anymore?

21:27.808 --> 21:29.723
No, I do.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.595
So, that's why I wanted to leave

21:32.726 --> 21:35.511
and Isaac walked me home.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.165
I see.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.299
Can you tell me what happened
when you got home?

21:40.429 --> 21:44.607
We divided up a pack of Swedish
Fish and a pack of gummy bears,

21:44.738 --> 21:46.653
and, uh, Isaac left to go
back to the food pantry.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.264
Also, I gave him
some pretzel rods.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.484
And that was the last time
you saw him?

21:51.614 --> 21:53.616
Yeah.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.015
Tamika.

22:01.145 --> 22:03.757
You got a Lloyd Turner here?

22:03.887 --> 22:05.411
Why?

22:05.541 --> 22:07.891
'Cause I got to talk to him.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.850
You think he knows
something about Isaac?

22:09.980 --> 22:10.981
Yeah.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.679
I'll tell you right now,

22:12.809 --> 22:14.550
I don't think he knows
anything about Isaac.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.683
We still got to talk to him,
all right?

22:16.813 --> 22:17.988
Lloyd?

22:19.250 --> 22:21.557
- Lloyd.
- Lloyd, don't run.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.211
Lloyd!

22:23.342 --> 22:25.039
Lloyd, don't run!

22:25.169 --> 22:27.737
Nope. Nope. Come here.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.435
Put your hands
against the wall.

22:29.565 --> 22:30.827
It'll-it'll be okay.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.655
Can somebody call my
sister and tell her

22:32.786 --> 22:33.613
- I might not be home for dinner?
- Where's the kid, Lloyd?

22:33.743 --> 22:35.136
I don't know.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.529
You took off running,
you know something.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.139
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.575
- I didn't do anything.
- Then why'd you run?

22:39.706 --> 22:42.099
I used to do things.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.014
What kind of things, Lloyd?

22:44.145 --> 22:45.712
The kind of thing

22:45.842 --> 22:48.018
I think somebody's doing
to Isaac right now.

22:48.149 --> 22:51.370
The kind of things
- I don't do anymore.
- Get him out of here.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.513
So, you're a proofreader
at a law firm

23:04.644 --> 23:06.689
and volunteer
at a food pantry.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.735
I try to do something
that's worthwhile.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.519
Yeah. You ever tempted to slip
back into your old ways

23:10.650 --> 23:12.826
- working at the food pantry?
- No.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.349
A lot of young kids around.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.264
That's not difficult for you?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.961
It's been almost 20 years since
I've acted on that impulse,

23:18.092 --> 23:20.747
yet you seem intent on doubting
that can control myself.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.879
Lloyd, I'm a detective.
Part of what I do is to doubt

23:23.010 --> 23:24.490
whatever it is people tell me.

23:24.620 --> 23:25.839
Now, you work with the Trumans,
is that right?

23:25.969 --> 23:27.275
- Yes.
- So you're around
their son Isaac.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.711
I'm around the whole family.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.713
Were you around them
- this morning?
- No.

23:30.844 --> 23:33.673
- Where were you?
- I-I got to work at 7:00.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.675
That's pretty early
to start work.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.851
I have to proofread documents
from the night before.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.330
Yeah, and when do you take lunch
if you start at 7:00?

23:39.461 --> 23:42.290
I-I take lunch at 11:00,
if I take lunch.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.334
Did you take lunch this morning?

23:43.465 --> 23:45.249
No, I had a sandwich at my desk.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.425
And you left work at what time?

23:46.555 --> 23:47.904
30.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.123
Yeah. Where'd you go then?

23:49.253 --> 23:50.124
- The food pantry.
- How'd you get there?

23:50.254 --> 23:51.821
- The bus.
- Which bus?

23:51.952 --> 23:53.040
- The B54.
- What stop?

23:53.170 --> 23:53.997
Forrest Avenue.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.390
I didn't do it!

23:55.521 --> 23:57.174
I didn't do it.

24:06.314 --> 24:09.186
Your friend, uh, she had to know
this guy has a history, right?

24:09.317 --> 24:11.275
I'm sure she does.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.669
Seemed like she thought
we were wrong for taking him in.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.933
Yeah. Didn't help
that it was me doing it.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.196
I guess you didn't leave
on the best of terms, huh?

24:19.327 --> 24:20.807
I didn't leave.

24:20.937 --> 24:23.070
She did.

24:24.332 --> 24:27.248
N-Not that I didn't have
something to do with it.

24:28.292 --> 24:32.732
My mother says cops aren't known
for long and happy marriages.

24:32.862 --> 24:34.995
There's probably
some truth to that.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.171
Yeah.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.444
- What do we have as of now?
- All right.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.012
Henry said that
the last time he saw Isaac

24:52.142 --> 24:53.709
was when he was
walking him home.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.538
And the guy I'm talking to
seems to have an alibi.

24:56.669 --> 24:57.452
In other words, we have nothing.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.975
And it starts to get dark

24:59.106 --> 25:00.977
around 4:30.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.326
However scared this kid has been
up until now,

25:02.457 --> 25:03.893
it's gonna get
a whole lot scarier.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.460
Yeah, and I got to let

25:05.591 --> 25:06.983
this guy go, though, don't I?

25:07.114 --> 25:10.030
Yeah. You do.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.205
All right.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.341
- All right, this one's done.
- Thanks, Sarge.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.649
You can't bring dogs
in here, sir.

25:23.957 --> 25:26.394
My apologies, Mr. Turner.
When a child goes missing...

25:26.525 --> 25:28.788
It's okay, it's-it's all right.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.094
If I were in your position,
I'd suspect me, too.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.361
You let him go?

25:38.667 --> 25:40.277
He's not the man, Mr. Truman.

25:40.408 --> 25:41.496
But he's
a convicted sex offender.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.063
I heard the detective say that.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.412
That doesn't mean that

25:44.543 --> 25:46.457
he's the man
who abducted your son.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.808
So what do we do now?

25:48.938 --> 25:51.506
You can go home, or you can wait
in the room we have for you.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.813
I don't want to go home.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.162
Okay.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.859
Come on.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.600
Greetings and
salutations, Chief.

25:58.731 --> 26:01.560
This is Nadia Nye of
<i>All New York News.</i>

26:01.690 --> 26:03.257
I don't know that
the two of you have met.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.041
- How you doing, Nadia?
- Chief.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.783
So, you got
more bad news for me?

26:07.914 --> 26:08.915
No, we actually have
some good news for you.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.481
Nadia's news organization
has managed

26:10.612 --> 26:12.396
to procure cell phone video

26:12.527 --> 26:13.833
of the entirety of

26:13.963 --> 26:15.835
this morning's
unfortunate incident.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.227
Take it away, Nadia.

26:17.358 --> 26:19.795
When you watch the video
from the beginning,

26:19.926 --> 26:23.103
you'll see it's clear
you are the one being attacked.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.321
I mean, you're
the one defending yourself,

26:24.452 --> 26:25.975
and, might I add,

26:26.106 --> 26:27.324
with a minimum of
physical force.

26:27.455 --> 26:28.761
Personally,

26:28.891 --> 26:30.719
I thought you were being
rather gentle.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.329
Nadia is someone we can

26:32.460 --> 26:33.679
and should be
working with, John.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.333
It's our understanding
that with access

26:36.464 --> 26:38.074
comes responsibility.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.077
And you'd like
to be given access?

26:41.208 --> 26:43.558
You pick and choose which news
organization you give it to.

26:43.689 --> 26:46.039
I'd like to see it be us.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.823
One hand
washes the other.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.173
I dropped off a copy at
the Chief of Patrol's office.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.610
Thanks.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.134
I'll put it on your tab.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.317
Hey!

27:03.447 --> 27:04.579
I told you,

27:04.710 --> 27:06.102
you cannot bring your dog inside.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.538
Listen, I know something
about this morning.

27:07.669 --> 27:10.019
What about this morning?

27:10.150 --> 27:11.455
I wasn't gonna say anything,

27:11.586 --> 27:13.022
because of the way

27:13.153 --> 27:15.329
you guys treated me
when I found the phone,

27:15.459 --> 27:17.853
but it's not fair to the boy
to have to pay because I'm mad.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.204
All right, uh, just...

27:21.335 --> 27:22.858
wait back there, please.
Thank you.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.775
Yeah, hey, Killian.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.255
Yeah, you better get
down here right away.

27:28.385 --> 27:29.648
Front desk. Okay.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.266
Hey.

27:39.396 --> 27:40.876
- He friendly?
- In a manner of speaking.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.969
There's a guy

27:47.100 --> 27:49.711
who waits outside
the food pantry sometimes.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.408
Sometimes he waits
outside the church.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.062
Ah. You talking about Henry?

27:53.193 --> 27:54.542
Not Henry.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.935
See, this is why
I wasn't gonna say anything.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.501
I know who you're
talking about.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.329
I know who Henry is.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.897
He works with Tamika and
the Trumans in the food pantry.

28:02.028 --> 28:04.595
Because we live
on the street

28:04.726 --> 28:06.293
doesn't mean we're insane
or delusional, you know.

28:06.423 --> 28:07.773
Nah, I don't think that.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.471
This guy works for Transit.

28:10.601 --> 28:11.907
I don't know
what he does,

28:12.038 --> 28:13.866
but he usually has
on an orange vest,

28:13.996 --> 28:16.259
and he spends a lot of time
talking to the boy.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.913
Something about him isn't right.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.307
Okay?

28:20.437 --> 28:21.569
I said it.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.963
Okay. All right.
Hey, thank you.

28:27.401 --> 28:29.272
<i>Okay, now,</i>

28:29.403 --> 28:30.534
how would Isaac have
gotten back to Saint Abigail's

28:30.665 --> 28:32.145
after leaving your house?

28:32.275 --> 28:35.235
How come you don't have
a uniform on?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.715
It's-- I'm a detective.
Detectives don't wear uniforms.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.542
You know what would be great

28:38.673 --> 28:39.630
is if you could tell us

28:39.761 --> 28:41.110
what route he took.

28:41.241 --> 28:43.199
He'd go to the corner
and turn right.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.288
Corner, huh?
Can you tell us which corner?

28:45.419 --> 28:46.725
The corner where you go
to get the L train.

28:46.855 --> 28:47.726
And is there a stop there?

28:49.031 --> 28:49.902
Yeah.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.077
You know what would be great?

28:51.207 --> 28:52.208
If you showed us.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.210
I thought I couldn't leave.

28:55.690 --> 28:56.909
We'll all go together, okay?

28:57.039 --> 28:58.127
We can take a walk together.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.260
How's it going?

29:00.390 --> 29:03.567
What does it mean that
she has a white shirt on?

29:03.698 --> 29:05.134
It means she's the boss.

29:05.265 --> 29:05.831
We were thinking
of taking a walk.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.529
Mind if I come along?

29:08.659 --> 29:10.400
I don't have an opinion
one way or the other.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.838
Cool. Okay.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.411
It's a nice day to be
outside, huh, Henry?

29:23.196 --> 29:24.197
That's the house
with the mean dog.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.677
So we walk
on this side of the street.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.028
Oh, that's smart.
That's a good approach.

29:29.158 --> 29:30.681
So, my guess is that
you and Isaac turn left

29:30.812 --> 29:31.770
at the light, is that right,
Henry?

29:31.900 --> 29:33.989
Unless we were getting Carvel.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.643
Then we would've gone
right at the light,

29:35.774 --> 29:39.081
then we would've turned around
and walked back with our cones.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.301
Soft serve vanilla
in a small sugar cone,

29:41.431 --> 29:42.824
nothing like it.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.478
Yeah, is that what you'd get?

29:44.608 --> 29:46.915
A, uh, soft serve vanilla
in a small sugar cone?

29:47.046 --> 29:49.091
Unless the motorman was buying.

29:49.222 --> 29:52.747
Then we'd get large
'cause he was buying.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.575
Can you describe the motorman
to us, Henry?

29:58.187 --> 30:00.320
I have to take
this picture first.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.149
Sure.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.194
You don't see
very many of these.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.543
No, Henry, you don't.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.807
You take pictures of
anything else, Henry?

30:08.937 --> 30:10.721
Trains, too.
Also the tracks,

30:10.852 --> 30:12.767
and the blue and white
enamel signs

30:12.898 --> 30:14.813
that say what station it is.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.684
Can I see some of
those pictures?

30:21.123 --> 30:22.951
You'll give it back,
though, right?

30:23.082 --> 30:24.692
I promise.

30:34.006 --> 30:37.270
There are pictures here
from inside a train yard.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.575
Yeah.

30:38.706 --> 30:39.968
How did you get in there?

30:40.099 --> 30:41.796
The... the motorman let us in.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.711
- You and Isaac?
- Yeah.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.147
How did you know
he was a motorman, Henry?

30:45.278 --> 30:47.802
He had a motorman's
badge on his vest.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.499
- An orange vest?
- Yeah.

30:49.630 --> 30:51.675
Do you know the motorman's name,
- Henry?
- No.

30:51.806 --> 30:52.763
Do you know where he lives?

30:52.894 --> 30:54.591
Upstairs from the vaping shop.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.115
And you know which one?

30:56.245 --> 30:58.073
Closer to the 3 train
than the L train,

30:58.204 --> 30:59.945
'cause when Isaac
and I went over there,

31:00.075 --> 31:02.904
we took the L train
and it was a long walk.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.601
Henry,
what street?

31:04.732 --> 31:06.168
Do you know the street?

31:06.299 --> 31:08.083
I know there was a stop
sign on the corner.

31:09.824 --> 31:12.827
1810 Wyckoff Avenue.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.962
- Thank you, Henry.
- Thanks.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.137
Thank you.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.969
Transit has an employee at this
address named Ronald Kolodny.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.709
They got him listed
as a mechanic, though,

31:25.840 --> 31:27.842
- not a motorman.
- All right.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.844
The super says he hasn't
been there in a while.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.454
Anything in the apartment?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.413
- Yeah. Toys.
- What kind of toys?

31:33.543 --> 31:34.414
Build-your-own-cyborg,

31:34.544 --> 31:35.632
trampolines,

31:35.763 --> 31:36.807
virtual reality glasses.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.418
Toys to lure a ten-year-old boy.

31:38.548 --> 31:41.943
We got to get to that
train yard right now.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.085
Think you'll be able
to conduct yourself

31:53.215 --> 31:55.043
with appropriate decorum
this afternoon,

31:55.174 --> 31:57.132
- Officer Quinlan?
- I do, Your Honor.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.568
And I'd like to apologize

31:58.699 --> 32:00.179
for my behavior earlier.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.310
Mr. Parcell.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.921
You ready to resume

32:03.051 --> 32:04.923
your cross-examination
of the witness?

32:05.053 --> 32:06.359
Assuming she lets me,
Your Honor.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.969
We've already established

32:08.100 --> 32:09.449
she's gonna let you,
Mr. Parcell.

32:09.579 --> 32:10.754
Please proceed.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.669
Officer Quinlan.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.630
Is it possible that,
given your personal history,

32:16.760 --> 32:18.197
you identified

32:18.327 --> 32:19.894
the wrong man
in that photograph?

32:24.899 --> 32:26.248
I separate my personal history

32:26.379 --> 32:28.294
from my professional responsibilities.

32:29.599 --> 32:32.167
And I wasn't relying
solely on the photograph.

32:32.298 --> 32:33.864
Along with the jewelry

32:33.995 --> 32:35.301
that he took from the apartment,

32:35.431 --> 32:36.693
he also had on him

32:36.824 --> 32:38.957
a knife and seven zip ties.

32:39.087 --> 32:41.481
He didn't just rob people,
Mr. Parcell.

32:41.611 --> 32:42.961
He terrorized them.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.788
Ask that the witness
confine her remarks

32:44.919 --> 32:46.312
to answering the question.

32:46.442 --> 32:47.878
You opened it up
to personal attacks,

32:48.009 --> 32:50.272
Counselor;
works both ways.

32:51.186 --> 32:54.755
Given your mother's chronic
addiction to hard narcotics,

32:54.885 --> 32:57.627
you really deny having a bias
against drug addicts?

33:03.894 --> 33:08.160
I deny having any bias that gets
in the way of me doing my job.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.900
When I put on this uniform,

33:10.031 --> 33:12.033
I am bound by the oath
that I took

33:12.164 --> 33:13.556
and I act accordingly.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.603
Okay, so you expect us
to believe that you kept

33:16.733 --> 33:19.823
a level head, put your feelings
about your mother aside,

33:19.954 --> 33:21.260
made sure there was
sufficient probable cause

33:21.390 --> 33:22.522
to justify a search

33:22.652 --> 33:24.480
and brought Mr. Rodriguez
into custody

33:24.611 --> 33:26.134
the way you would
any other suspect.

33:26.265 --> 33:27.701
I expect that

33:27.831 --> 33:29.790
because it's the truth.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.879
I apologize again
for earlier.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.142
I wasn't expecting
my mother to be brought up.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.622
But when
I'm at work,

33:35.752 --> 33:38.016
I'm able to do my job just fine.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.540
And I also dutifully recorded
all of this into my patrol log,

33:40.670 --> 33:41.976
per regulation,

33:42.107 --> 33:44.022
if you care to take a look.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.989
- How'd you do?
- Mm.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.947
Perp changed his plea to guilty.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.601
Sentencing guidelines calls

33:58.732 --> 34:00.038
for eight-to-ten years minimum.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.823
How'd your homicide go?

34:02.953 --> 34:04.825
My homicide.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.437
I should probably
fess up to, uh,

34:08.568 --> 34:09.917
what that was about.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.572
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.619
I'm not here for a homicide.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.056
I'm here for a divorce.

34:18.186 --> 34:20.884
I guess that's
kind of a homicide.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.364
Feels like it.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.714
Kids?
Three.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.368
- Ooh.
- And because she works

34:26.499 --> 34:29.023
in Manhattan South,
guess who's getting transferred?

34:29.154 --> 34:30.285
They tell you where?

34:30.416 --> 34:31.460
Did not.

34:35.856 --> 34:37.510
Well, I should probably,
uh, hang out here,

34:37.640 --> 34:38.946
wait for my lawyer.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.904
Bye.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.043
You did real good
on that stand, Brandy.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.089
Thanks.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.673
We should probably wait
for backup, huh, Inspector?

35:10.804 --> 35:11.848
We're not waiting
for anything.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.355
What's going on?

35:40.486 --> 35:41.530
Ronald Kolodny?
Yeah.

35:41.661 --> 35:42.966
Police, may we come in?

35:46.056 --> 35:48.276
What time'd you clock in
this morning, Ronald?

35:48.407 --> 35:49.582
00 a.m., why?

35:49.712 --> 35:51.888
It's just you working here?
Nobody else?

35:52.019 --> 35:53.803
Yeah, usually just me. Why you
asking me these questions?

35:53.934 --> 35:55.457
Well, we just need to fill in
a few details,

35:55.588 --> 35:57.633
- is all.
- D-Details about what?

35:57.764 --> 35:59.853
Ever play a game called
build-your-own-cyborg, Ronald?

35:59.983 --> 36:01.507
No.

36:01.637 --> 36:02.856
I know a kid
who likes that game.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.292
His name is Isaac Truman.
You seen him?

36:04.423 --> 36:05.641
No.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.082
No, that's been locked up
for years.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.780
- No one goes in there.
- Somebody's going in now.

36:15.303 --> 36:16.957
I got it, I got it.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.840
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch him.

36:49.903 --> 36:53.385
Chief.
Chief.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.605
Hopefully our friend Nadia
over there

36:56.736 --> 36:59.042
will film us doing something
positive once in a while.

36:59.173 --> 37:01.436
You see the videos
- she got to us?
- I saw them.

37:01.567 --> 37:05.527
The commissioner saw them,
and the mayor saw them.

37:07.094 --> 37:10.010
Well, I'm...
I'm just hoping that

37:10.140 --> 37:11.751
it gets as many
hits or views

37:11.881 --> 37:13.753
as the first one.
Yeah, well,

37:13.883 --> 37:15.320
whether they do or they don't,

37:15.450 --> 37:16.538
there's a press conference tomorrow

37:16.669 --> 37:18.453
in which
the mayor will be speaking

37:18.584 --> 37:21.195
to the maligning
of police officers,

37:21.326 --> 37:22.718
specifically heroic
police officers

37:22.849 --> 37:25.417
acting above and beyond
the call of duty,

37:25.547 --> 37:27.593
i.e., you.

37:29.812 --> 37:33.033
So, they'll be, uh,
singling me out?

37:33.163 --> 37:34.643
That's right, John.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.573
Had to work up my courage.

Henry doesn't like it when
there's too many people around.
