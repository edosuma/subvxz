00:08.567 --> 00:10.872
Hey, Mike,
it's Rachel.

00:10.873 --> 00:12.140
I know I shouldn't
be doing this.

00:12.208 --> 00:13.475
I know you're seeing Jenny,

00:13.542 --> 00:15.477
but I can't stop thinking
about the kiss,

00:15.544 --> 00:17.812
and I can't go back.

[Elevator dings]

00:32.494 --> 00:35.563
Morning, Jessica.

00:35.631 --> 00:37.132
Ms. Pearson.

00:37.199 --> 00:39.334
Hey, I just wanna
thank you so much

00:39.402 --> 00:42.937
for keeping me on
despite the--

00:43.005 --> 00:44.539
I guess, I just
want to let you know

00:44.607 --> 00:46.941
that I'm gonna work hard,

00:47.009 --> 00:50.712
and I'm gonna--you know,
I'm gonna make you proud.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.882
Not--not like a son--
you know--

00:53.949 --> 00:58.887
I mean, we don't really
look that much alike, I guess.

00:58.954 --> 01:00.789
That's a--that's
a strange thing to say.

01:00.856 --> 01:03.625
Uh, I just--what I meant
is that I really appreciate

01:03.693 --> 01:05.927
everything that you--
okay.

01:05.995 --> 01:09.564
[Construction sounds]

01:09.632 --> 01:11.332
- Hardman?
- One would assume.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.802
- Did he ask you?
- No, he did not.

01:15.971 --> 01:17.205
He needs your signature.

01:17.273 --> 01:20.241
And yet there was a wall
here yesterday.

01:20.309 --> 01:22.577
Well, at least he didn't ask
for his office back.

01:22.645 --> 01:23.878
I wouldn't have
given it back.

01:23.946 --> 01:25.480
I wouldn't have given
yours back to you.

01:25.548 --> 01:28.316
Unless you asked
really nicely.

01:28.384 --> 01:30.418
Isn't that--

01:30.486 --> 01:32.454
- Mine.
- Shot across the bow.

01:32.521 --> 01:34.255
No, an act of war.

01:34.323 --> 01:36.124
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

01:36.192 --> 01:37.926
[Sighs]

01:37.993 --> 01:40.128
It's not taupe.

01:40.196 --> 01:41.896
The color, the walls.

01:41.964 --> 01:43.465
Hardman asked for taupe.

01:43.532 --> 01:45.533
I mean, it might be tan,

01:45.601 --> 01:47.168
or beige
with a hint of mauve.

01:47.236 --> 01:48.336
But it definitely isn't taupe,

01:48.404 --> 01:49.404
and don't try to tell me
that it is.

01:49.472 --> 01:50.972
Hey, Louis,
what color shades

01:51.040 --> 01:52.240
would go well
with these taupe walls?

01:52.308 --> 01:54.175
- Enough.
- I didn't even say anything.

01:54.243 --> 01:56.044
Did you want something?

01:56.112 --> 01:57.912
Yes, chain of command
is everything to me.

01:57.980 --> 01:59.280
If I don't know
who to answer to,

01:59.348 --> 02:01.382
I might as well be living
naked on a kibbutz

02:01.450 --> 02:02.817
in the middle of Africa.

02:02.885 --> 02:04.919
An option worth considering,
though we'd miss you.

02:04.987 --> 02:05.920
[Mouths silently]
Not really.

02:05.988 --> 02:07.255
Your point?

02:07.323 --> 02:08.356
Who do I work for?

02:08.424 --> 02:09.791
I assume I work for you,

02:09.859 --> 02:11.626
but Hardman just asked me
to personally summarize

02:11.694 --> 02:12.761
every case at this firm.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.229
And I was hoping maybe
that you can

02:14.296 --> 02:15.797
let him know that
I answer to you.

02:15.865 --> 02:18.266
You do answer to me, Louis.

02:18.334 --> 02:20.201
And Daniel and I are
on the same page on this.

02:20.269 --> 02:23.872
You're the right man
for the job.

02:23.939 --> 02:27.041
Well, thank you,
that's all I needed to hear.

02:29.311 --> 02:31.012
Why'd you lie?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.180
Because you don't
let the children know

02:32.248 --> 02:35.183
that mommy and
daddy are fighting.

02:59.542 --> 03:00.742
Uh, Rachel.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.744
Hi.
I'm busy.

03:02.812 --> 03:03.778
Oh, okay.
How's it going?

03:03.846 --> 03:06.181
Busy,
so if you don't mind, I--

03:06.248 --> 03:09.551
I need to talk to you
for a second, okay?

03:09.618 --> 03:10.919
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:10.986 --> 03:13.021
So
 Zane, I need you.

03:13.088 --> 03:14.923
In my office.
Now.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.491
- You were saying?
- I just, um--

03:16.559 --> 03:18.893
What part of "now"
wasn't clear?

03:18.961 --> 03:20.495
Ugh.

03:20.563 --> 03:22.297
By the time I'm in my chair.

03:22.364 --> 03:23.298
I should probably go.

- Taxes?
- Oh...no.

- Mergers?
- Hate him.

- But I--
- Didn't work.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.594
- Really?
- I am tied in, Harvey.

05:12.662 --> 05:14.563
There are a lot of underbelly
things that I can tell you,

05:14.630 --> 05:16.097
but trust me,
this is not one of them.

05:16.165 --> 05:18.233
- Even Norma knows.
- What?

05:18.301 --> 05:20.268
People just don't like that
he's right all the time.

05:20.336 --> 05:21.970

in bankruptcy?

05:23.906 --> 05:25.507
Excellent.
I think.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.942
We don't do a lot of work
with bankruptcy.

05:27.009 --> 05:28.276

a raise.

I could walk across instead?

05:36.719 --> 05:37.752
I don't like him either.

05:37.820 --> 05:38.987
He's always been dubious
of me.

05:39.055 --> 05:40.055
I don't know
if it's because

05:40.122 --> 05:41.456
I'm a woman or black
or maybe

05:41.524 --> 05:42.691
he just doesn't like--

05:42.758 --> 05:43.792
Your overbearing nature?

05:43.860 --> 05:45.727
Your holier-than-thou
attitude?

05:45.795 --> 05:47.963
This is not a joke, Harvey.

05:48.030 --> 05:49.798
How this is gonna
go down is he's--

05:49.866 --> 05:51.233
I know, he's gonna
worm his way in,

05:51.300 --> 05:52.567
and then one day,
call for a vote.

05:52.635 --> 05:55.337
And when that day comes,
every vote will count.

05:55.404 --> 05:58.106
- Even Paul's.
- Hardman is awesome.

06:00.243 --> 06:03.311
I mean, he, um, brought in this
omelet bar for the associates,

06:03.379 --> 06:07.249
but it's no...big deal.

06:07.316 --> 06:08.984
Really good.

06:09.051 --> 06:14.456
This pineapple was growing on
a plantation on Lanai yesterday.

06:14.524 --> 06:17.559
Do not trust it.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.227
Don't trust the pineapple?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.262
Hardman.

06:20.329 --> 06:21.530
Would you--come on.

06:21.597 --> 06:22.597
- I don't want it.
- Are you serious?

06:22.665 --> 06:24.065
You're afraid
of the pineapple?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.534
I know it's got a rough
exterior, but it's all sweet

06:25.601 --> 06:26.935
on the inside,
I promise.

06:27.003 --> 06:28.703
"Come on.
I love you, Harvey."

06:28.771 --> 06:31.606
It'll be good for you.

06:31.674 --> 06:33.608
- Mmm.
- See?

06:33.676 --> 06:34.609
It's spectacular.

06:34.677 --> 06:35.877
But this doesn't change
the fact

06:35.945 --> 06:36.878
that this is what he does.

06:36.946 --> 06:38.113
He's coming back and people

06:38.180 --> 06:39.114
are gonna
have to choose sides.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.449
Can I choose his side?

06:41.517 --> 06:42.684
Sure.

06:42.752 --> 06:44.653
Support a man you never met
over a partner

06:44.720 --> 06:46.154
who knows you never
went to Harvard,

knows you're not really a lawyer
and is keeping you on anyway.

06:49.892 --> 06:52.060

06:53.963 --> 06:55.864
I need you on Paul Porter.

- The bowtie guy?
- Every case he has--

06:58.668 --> 07:00.335
read, summarize,
find weaknesses.

07:00.403 --> 07:01.503
I want to know
everything he knows.

07:01.571 --> 07:02.737
- What, is he getting fired?
- Nope.

07:02.805 --> 07:05.373
He's getting lunch.

07:05.441 --> 07:07.442
So, Hardman's back.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.644
It's interesting stuff, huh?

07:09.712 --> 07:11.212
Lots to talk about.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.481
Do you have a question,
Louis?

07:13.549 --> 07:14.583
Yes.

07:14.650 --> 07:18.687
I mean, you know Jessica.

07:18.754 --> 07:20.755
That's not a question.

07:20.823 --> 07:24.559
- She seems bothered.
- Huh. Still not a question.

07:24.627 --> 07:26.361
Hardman was managing partner,
now she's managing partner.

07:26.429 --> 07:27.696
Do you even know
what a question is?

07:27.763 --> 07:29.864
Donna...look.
I need information.

07:29.932 --> 07:32.033
Now I wanna know what
the whole story is

07:32.101 --> 07:34.336
so I can formulate
some sort of strategy.

07:34.403 --> 07:39.741
You mean formulate
whose ass to kiss?

07:39.809 --> 07:41.676

to the stage reading

07:41.744 --> 07:44.446

07:52.521 --> 07:54.089
No!

07:54.156 --> 07:57.692
- We can go.
- No. No.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.902
I cannot tell you
what I do not know, Louis.

08:11.974 --> 08:12.907
Okay.

08:12.975 --> 08:16.211
Well, you know where they are.

08:34.496 --> 08:36.464

I kiss you like that

08:36.532 --> 08:38.265
and all you have
to say to me is "hi"?

08:38.333 --> 08:39.400
Come on, admit it.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.102

it was a good kiss, but...

08:45.675 --> 08:47.342
Oh...

08:47.410 --> 08:50.645
Jenny?

08:50.713 --> 08:55.650

08:55.718 --> 09:01.589
It turns out I kind of have
feelings for this other girl.

09:01.657 --> 09:05.260
So...it's over?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.200
Well, um,
in that case,

09:12.268 --> 09:15.003
then, yes,
it was a good kiss.

09:15.071 --> 09:20.141
But just so we're clear,
I rocked your world.

09:20.209 --> 09:24.679
You did.

09:24.747 --> 09:26.414
[Whispering] Now tell me
what would you say...

09:26.482 --> 09:28.583
[Loudly]
to helping me with my work

09:28.651 --> 09:31.252
in a professional capacity?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.388

09:33.456 --> 09:35.323
Actually, you know what,
you could.

09:35.391 --> 09:37.892
I have to summarize all those
cases in bankruptcy over there.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.294
It's funny because
I have to summarize

09:39.361 --> 09:42.363
all of the cases at the firm.

09:42.431 --> 09:43.865
For Hardman.

09:43.933 --> 09:46.367
Ooh.

09:46.435 --> 09:48.069
So you don't like him.
I don't.

09:48.137 --> 09:52.540
You wanna tell me why
over dinner?

09:52.608 --> 09:54.309
- Are you asking me out--
- On a date?

09:54.376 --> 09:56.745
Yeah, I am.

09:56.812 --> 09:57.912
To talk about Hardman?

09:57.980 --> 09:59.214
Hardman who?

09:59.281 --> 10:01.049
No, I wanna talk about
our kiss.

10:01.117 --> 10:02.684
And when I say, "talk about,"
I mean repeat.

10:02.752 --> 10:04.652

10:11.827 --> 10:12.927
And by "date" I mean--

10:12.995 --> 10:16.431
- Okay, no more of this.
- Yeah, of course.

10:20.836 --> 10:24.105
So this is
what it's like, huh?

10:24.173 --> 10:25.473
This is what what's like?

10:25.541 --> 10:29.511
Being closed
by Harvey Specter.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.279
I don't resent it.

10:31.347 --> 10:32.947
It's a great meal,
great table.

10:33.015 --> 10:35.150
But let's not pretend
it's not self-serving.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.752
Hardman is back.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.687
Jessica doesn't want
to go back to the kitchen.

10:39.755 --> 10:42.857
Jessica Pearson
was never the "housewife."

10:42.925 --> 10:46.027
You know where
my office is, Harvey?

10:46.095 --> 10:47.695
46.

10:47.763 --> 10:51.132
I've been knocked down
three floors in five years

10:51.200 --> 10:53.034
on Jessica's watch.

10:53.102 --> 10:54.335
We have to look into that.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.937
I don't want a new office.

10:56.005 --> 10:57.539
I want respect.

10:57.606 --> 11:01.376
What you want is for someone
to help you with Madison 25.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.411
You've done your homework.

11:03.479 --> 11:05.713
You are about
to lose a huge client, Paul.

11:05.781 --> 11:06.781
I don't want to close you.

11:06.849 --> 11:08.216
Let me close him.

11:08.284 --> 11:11.252
The problem is Tom Klapperich.
He's like you.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.788
He thinks he knows
better than everyone.

11:13.856 --> 11:15.890
Truth is he doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

11:15.958 --> 11:18.059
He needs to declare bankruptcy

11:18.127 --> 11:19.294
and he doesn't wanna
hear that.

11:19.361 --> 11:20.662
Well, let me keep him
in the family

11:20.729 --> 11:24.465
in exchange
for backing Jessica.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.901
Well, you close him,
then we'll talk.

11:26.969 --> 11:28.903
That's not so reassuring.

11:28.971 --> 11:31.639
You came to me.

11:31.707 --> 11:34.175
I didn't come to you.

11:34.243 --> 11:35.710
I'll see you on the first tee.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.012
No, you won't.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.248
Oh, is this where
you make your threat?

11:40.316 --> 11:42.517
I've had the carrot,
now I get the stick?

11:42.585 --> 11:44.552
That's not my style.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.955
The person you're gonna meet
on the tee is Fred Couples.

11:47.022 --> 11:48.957
And just so we're clear,

11:49.024 --> 11:52.627
that's being closed
by Harvey Specter.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.120
Let's talk football.

12:03.145 --> 12:06.114
Peyton Manning goes down
you lose your first 13 games.

12:06.843 --> 12:09.228
You gotta protect your assets
and build for the future.

12:09.231 --> 12:10.731
You don't wanna pay
28 million for a guy

12:10.799 --> 12:12.333
who may not play next year.

12:12.401 --> 12:13.568
So what do you do?

12:13.635 --> 12:14.569
You move on.

12:14.636 --> 12:16.337
The season isn't over,
Harvey.

12:16.405 --> 12:18.272
You're 200 million
in the red

12:18.340 --> 12:20.608
with 1/4 billion due
in two days.

12:20.676 --> 12:24.278
Madison 25
is going to be built.

12:24.346 --> 12:28.316
Madison 25 should be built,
but the market's changed.

12:28.383 --> 12:30.318
Vacancies are up,
rents are down,

12:30.385 --> 12:31.986
and you can't take out
a loan against your future

12:32.054 --> 12:33.454
if the money's
never gonna flow.

12:33.522 --> 12:35.823
It's time to protect
your franchise.

12:35.891 --> 12:37.225
Really?
I should just skate

12:37.292 --> 12:39.260
while the hundreds of
contractors and subcontractors

12:39.328 --> 12:41.362
that I've made financial
commitments to,

12:41.430 --> 12:43.664
they should just wait in line
with their hands held out,

12:43.732 --> 12:45.333
hoping for 50¢
on the dollar?

12:45.400 --> 12:47.969
They know how
the business works.

12:48.036 --> 12:50.371
Look, I know that Paul feels
I should protect myself.

12:50.439 --> 12:51.472
I should protect
my family business,

12:51.540 --> 12:54.408
but I want to protect
my family name.

12:54.476 --> 12:57.812
There's no shame
in declaring bankruptcy, okay?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.747
It's a tool that
will allow you to survive.

12:59.815 --> 13:02.116
Wanna know the kind of guy
I am, Harvey?

13:02.184 --> 13:04.118
I'm the kind of guy,

13:04.186 --> 13:07.755
that when the clock says,
"The game's over, take a knee,"

13:07.823 --> 13:09.757
that's when
I throw a hail Mary.

13:09.825 --> 13:12.927
Everybody throws a hail Mary
when they got nothing to lose.

13:12.995 --> 13:15.296
You got something to lose.

13:15.364 --> 13:16.931
I like long odds.

13:16.999 --> 13:19.934
Let's just say,
I won't declare bankruptcy.

13:20.002 --> 13:22.870
What are my other options?

13:22.938 --> 13:25.706
I have an idea.

13:36.118 --> 13:37.251
You were right...

13:37.319 --> 13:38.786
about Hardman and Jessica.

13:38.854 --> 13:42.490
- You want something from me.
- I do.

13:42.557 --> 13:44.959
Mike needs an extension
on a $1/4 billion loan.

13:45.027 --> 13:47.395
And you want me to believe
that you're here for Mike?

13:47.462 --> 13:48.496
Yes.

13:48.563 --> 13:50.665
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

13:50.732 --> 13:53.067
Harvey needs me.

13:53.135 --> 13:56.037
I know you're amazing
at dealing with banks, Louis.

13:56.104 --> 13:57.305
[Laughs]
What, do you think

13:57.372 --> 13:59.073
I'm gonna fall
for that shit?

13:59.141 --> 14:02.510
I mean just, like, the best.

14:05.814 --> 14:06.914
What bank?

14:06.982 --> 14:08.382
- National Metropolitan.
- The gatekeeper?

14:08.450 --> 14:11.585
Elaine Cohen?
[Chuckles] Exactly.

14:11.653 --> 14:14.488
So, you think
you can get him in?

14:14.556 --> 14:17.591
Well, you know
I can get him in.

14:17.659 --> 14:20.494
But you also know
I can keep him out.

14:20.562 --> 14:22.029
Okay, what's it gonna take?

14:22.097 --> 14:23.664
Five details
of the Pearson Hardman divide.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.166
- No. No.
- Three? One?

14:25.233 --> 14:28.502
One.

14:28.570 --> 14:30.859
And I get the Albee tickets.

14:32.344 --> 14:34.033
We get the Albee tickets.

14:38.914 --> 14:40.181
Tell a soul, deal's off.

14:40.248 --> 14:45.386
Done.

14:45.454 --> 14:46.854
I love Tom.

14:46.922 --> 14:48.756
I love Madison 25, really.

14:48.824 --> 14:50.591
But I'm afraid if you look
at the fine print,

14:50.659 --> 14:52.259
the terms of the loan
are what they are,

14:52.327 --> 14:53.627
and what they aren't

14:53.695 --> 14:55.997
is subject to renegotiation.
Are you kidding me?

14:56.064 --> 14:58.065
The terms of loans
are adjusted all the time.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.134
And you can see
he has the assets.

15:00.202 --> 15:02.303
What I see?

15:02.371 --> 15:06.674
Is that I'm gonna have to give
you a 50% haircut on that.

15:06.742 --> 15:08.009
That is not liquid.

15:08.076 --> 15:10.177
You're never gonna
be able to sell

15:10.245 --> 15:12.680
a minority partnership interest,
and that--

15:12.748 --> 15:14.749
a monkey could tell
you could never monetize that.

15:14.816 --> 15:16.517
You know what else
a monkey could tell you?

15:16.585 --> 15:20.121
You're about to ruin a property
that will make you millions.

15:20.188 --> 15:22.723
I'm so sorry, gentlemen,
but this is not 2007.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.126
We don't play that game
anymore.

15:25.193 --> 15:27.395
The days of you
high-flying people

15:27.462 --> 15:29.163
claiming you're richer
than God

15:29.231 --> 15:31.899
when all you're really doing is
moving assets around are over.

15:31.967 --> 15:33.267
Today we're gonna take
a look up your skirt

15:33.335 --> 15:34.802
and see what you have.

15:34.870 --> 15:39.440
And I'm afraid
you don't have much.

15:41.843 --> 15:42.843
- She actually said that?
- Yes.

15:42.911 --> 15:44.045
Please don't make me
relive it.

15:44.112 --> 15:46.947
As it is, I may drink a lot
on our date.

15:47.015 --> 15:50.351
You know,
if we're really gonna do this,

15:50.419 --> 15:53.988
we should probably be careful
talking about it here.

15:54.056 --> 15:55.790
Oh, you're right.
Yeah.

15:55.857 --> 15:58.192
We should definitely set some
dating ground rules.

15:58.260 --> 15:59.693
You're not taking me home,
to my place or yours.

15:59.761 --> 16:04.098
Whoa, okay, I'm not talking
about ground rules for sex.

16:04.166 --> 16:07.334
I'm talking about ground rules
for keeping this thing quiet.

16:07.402 --> 16:11.172
Oh. So you think if we went
to my place or yours,

16:11.239 --> 16:14.075
that means sex?

16:14.142 --> 16:17.344
Uh, no.
I mean--

16:17.412 --> 16:19.113
you--
[Laughs]

16:19.181 --> 16:20.614
Uh--
[Clears throat]

16:20.682 --> 16:23.117
What I meant was that I know you
didn't want to date anyone

16:23.185 --> 16:26.520
in the office, and I assume you
have a reason for that.

16:26.588 --> 16:27.721
Oh, okay, there is.

16:27.789 --> 16:30.291
There's a story.
I see it right there.

16:30.358 --> 16:31.425
There's no story there.
I dated someone here once.

16:31.493 --> 16:33.094
It didn't work out.
That's it.

16:33.161 --> 16:35.429
No more questions.
Those are my ground rules.

16:35.497 --> 16:38.365
Hmm, note to self:
touchy about dating history.

16:38.433 --> 16:40.301
Wow, I smell pheromones
in the air.

16:40.368 --> 16:44.672
Which suggests to me, Ms. Zane,
that you failed to grasp

16:44.739 --> 16:46.540
the importance of the task
that I assigned.

16:46.608 --> 16:47.775
Or unless you're done.

16:47.843 --> 16:48.776
- Well, I--
- No?

16:48.844 --> 16:50.277
You do realize you asked her

16:50.345 --> 16:53.280
to summarize every case
in the firm, right?

16:53.348 --> 16:55.382
I'm so sorry,
was I talking to you?

16:55.450 --> 16:57.618
Because I already
did your job for you.

16:57.686 --> 17:00.087
Actually,
the bank didn't budge.

17:00.155 --> 17:02.623
I got you in, Michael.

17:02.691 --> 17:05.358
What, do you expect me
to do everything?

17:05.426 --> 17:08.162
Now, do I have to gather
every first year

17:08.230 --> 17:10.598
and make them stay the night
because the paralegal

17:10.665 --> 17:12.599
was too busy flirting
and couldn't get it done?

17:12.666 --> 17:17.204
Actually, all the associates
are leaving early tonight.

17:17.271 --> 17:18.638
Excuse me?

17:18.707 --> 17:22.309
Yeah, Hardman invited everyone
to his box at the Garden.

17:22.377 --> 17:25.346
Springsteen.

17:25.413 --> 17:27.548
The boss?

17:27.616 --> 17:31.685
Wait, didn't he invite you?

17:34.389 --> 17:35.623
You think I want to spend
my evening with a bunch of

17:35.690 --> 17:37.091
douche bag associates
at a concert

17:37.159 --> 17:40.294
given by a goddamn
octogenarian?

17:40.362 --> 17:42.663
Get it done.

17:54.843 --> 17:57.745
If I wanted to sink his
business to keep his business,

17:57.812 --> 17:59.647
I could have
done that myself.

17:59.714 --> 18:02.183
Hello, Paul.
Make yourself at home.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.085
You made him think he could
risk, not just this project,

18:05.153 --> 18:08.422
but everything he owns,
on a personal guarantee.

18:08.490 --> 18:10.991
Are you crazy?
What I am, Paul,

18:11.059 --> 18:15.095
is working my ass off
to make your client happy.

18:15.163 --> 18:17.665
You think I haven't
tried everything

18:17.732 --> 18:19.867
to keep
his dream alive?

18:19.935 --> 18:21.869
The fact is, the bank
is going to foreclose.

18:21.937 --> 18:23.103
Tom needs
to be protected,

18:23.171 --> 18:26.140
and your plan
is too big a risk.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.208
For you, yes,
but not for Tom,

18:27.275 --> 18:28.842
and as I understand it,
we work for him.

18:28.910 --> 18:29.944
[Laughing]
No, no, no, no.

18:30.011 --> 18:32.213
I work for him.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.281
You are working
for me.

18:34.349 --> 18:36.016
I said he needed
to declare bankruptcy,

18:36.084 --> 18:40.054
but, oh, you--
you played it your way.

18:40.121 --> 18:44.558
Well, Jessica may give
you free rein to do that,

18:44.626 --> 18:47.027
but I can't imagine
Hardman will.

18:47.095 --> 18:51.699
You know, Paul, couples passed
on a little tip for you.

18:51.766 --> 18:55.135
He said your game was weak
because you were too cautious.

18:55.203 --> 18:58.572
I said, "It's not your game,
it's who you are."

19:05.714 --> 19:11.585
Harvey, I may have been
knocked down to the 46th floor,

19:11.653 --> 19:13.721
but bankruptcy

19:13.788 --> 19:19.326
is on the rise.

19:19.394 --> 19:24.431
My influence in this firm
is not nothing.

19:28.737 --> 19:31.372
You get Tom
to sign those papers.

19:31.439 --> 19:36.243
Is that a threat?

19:36.311 --> 19:38.212
I don't make threats.

19:38.280 --> 19:42.149
I just do
what I do.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.773
You find anything?

19:59.841 --> 20:01.642
Oh, I'm gonna make
Paul love you.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.777
That's doubtful. He got wind
of our little maneuver.

20:03.845 --> 20:04.945
- [Laughs]
- What?

20:05.013 --> 20:06.947
You said "got wind."

20:07.015 --> 20:09.717
[Clears throat] Anyway,
I have another maneuver.

20:09.784 --> 20:10.951
A better one.

20:11.019 --> 20:12.953
Paul says we tell Tom
there's no other way.

20:13.021 --> 20:14.321
But there is
another way.

20:14.389 --> 20:15.589
Oh, wait, you don't even want
to hear it?

20:15.657 --> 20:16.991
Of course
I want to hear it.

20:17.058 --> 20:19.693
Since when do I take marching
orders from a bow tie?

20:19.761 --> 20:20.828
There are eight projects
being built

20:20.895 --> 20:22.796
in the two blocks
around Madison 25.

20:22.864 --> 20:24.531
Every one of them
started after it.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.767
Madison 25 is the centerpiece
of the whole development.

20:26.835 --> 20:28.936
If it's not finished,
they're all worthless.

20:29.004 --> 20:30.871
That's not
the bank's problem.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.674
But it is, 'cause guess
what six of these buildings

20:33.742 --> 20:37.678
have in common.

20:37.746 --> 20:39.446
National's
backing them all?

20:39.514 --> 20:42.283
Doesn't make sense for them
to foreclose and devalue

20:42.350 --> 20:43.317
all their other projects.

20:43.385 --> 20:45.286
Unless they have
another agenda.

20:45.353 --> 20:50.057
Huh, I wonder where we could
ever find evidence of that?

20:50.125 --> 20:52.359
Think that helps us?

20:52.427 --> 20:54.228
I think we can take this
to the bank.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.429
Now, you see,
that's funny

20:55.497 --> 20:56.964
because we're actually going
to a bank.

20:57.032 --> 21:01.001
That's good.

21:04.873 --> 21:07.274
Twice in one day,
Mr. Specter.

21:07.342 --> 21:09.243
I understand how
your client must feel.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.878
Actually,
he's feeling fantastic.

21:10.945 --> 21:12.346
You know why that is?

21:12.414 --> 21:15.416
'Cause I told him the balloon
payment's going away.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.886
Okay, I'll bite.
Why is it going away?

21:18.953 --> 21:20.254
Because as much
as people hate lawyers,

21:20.322 --> 21:22.156
you know who they hate more?
Bankers.

21:22.223 --> 21:23.991
After all,
you were the ones

21:24.059 --> 21:25.959
that got us into this recession
in the first place, right?

21:26.027 --> 21:28.962
Oh, gentlemen.
I do not need a history lesson.

21:29.030 --> 21:30.731
Then let's talk
about the future.

21:30.799 --> 21:34.001
What happens to Madison 25 after
you force it into bankruptcy?

21:34.069 --> 21:36.570
Maybe someone steps in
and finishes it.

21:36.638 --> 21:38.272
Someone whose recent
merger leaves them

21:38.340 --> 21:40.407
needing a large
downtown address?

21:40.475 --> 21:41.742
Oh, now that
you mention it,

21:41.810 --> 21:43.577
there's a little item
in your shareholder letter

21:43.645 --> 21:46.080
about the search for
a new corporate headquarters.

21:46.147 --> 21:48.582
- Yeah, I like to read.
- Well, I don't--

21:48.650 --> 21:50.317
You intend to leverage
this foreclosure

21:50.385 --> 21:52.519
to get a prime piece
of real estate at a song.

21:52.587 --> 21:55.756
You see, Elaine,
we looked up your skirt.

21:55.824 --> 21:57.124
And the six clients
you represent

21:57.192 --> 21:59.259
surrounding Madison 25--
well, it turns out

21:59.327 --> 22:01.362
Pearson Hardman actually
reps three of them.

22:01.429 --> 22:03.630
And when the other three find
out about what you've done,

22:03.698 --> 22:05.332
which will happen right after
I leave here,

22:05.400 --> 22:06.934
we'll rep all six.

22:07.001 --> 22:09.169
And when we move
their business elsewhere,

22:09.237 --> 22:12.005
they'll take roughly,
mm--

22:12.073 --> 22:14.408
Mm, a shitload of money
out of your bank.

22:14.476 --> 22:17.378
- Shitload?
- Well, give or take.

22:22.517 --> 22:25.719
It's important that nobody
knows about this.

22:25.787 --> 22:28.122
I've never...

22:28.189 --> 22:31.325
done anything
like this before.

22:31.393 --> 22:35.095
Louis, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

22:35.163 --> 22:36.764
Exploring your options
is something

22:36.831 --> 22:39.700
everybody does
these days.

22:39.768 --> 22:41.535
Sometimes you're
in a relationship,

22:41.603 --> 22:43.504
they take you
for granted.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.707
You shouldn't be taken
for granted.

22:46.775 --> 22:48.976
I wouldn't take you
for granted.

22:49.043 --> 22:51.178
I've never even
considered this.

22:51.246 --> 22:53.380
Really?
People do it all the time.

22:53.448 --> 22:54.615
Well, not me.

22:54.682 --> 22:56.350
I never even let myself
think it, let alone--

22:56.418 --> 22:58.018
Sometimes, Louis,

22:58.086 --> 23:00.387
the only way
to move on

23:00.455 --> 23:05.392
is try something new.
[Chuckles]

23:05.460 --> 23:07.361
You're trying
to seduce me.

23:07.429 --> 23:10.464
I'm merely saying,

23:10.532 --> 23:13.434
if Jessica Pearson can't see the
quality of the work that you do,

23:13.501 --> 23:15.903
I know half a dozen firms
who will.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.805
Litt, nothing,
and nobody.

23:17.872 --> 23:19.807
I mean, who does
she think she is?

23:19.874 --> 23:22.910
So...
high and mighty.

23:22.977 --> 23:26.880
The question isn't,
"Can I get you an offer?"

23:26.948 --> 23:29.950
It's, "How good an offer
can I get you?"

23:33.588 --> 23:35.889
Uh, solicitation.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.926
Drugs and prostitution,
that's what you think of me?

23:38.993 --> 23:40.360
I've guessed
everything else.

23:40.428 --> 23:42.062
Okay, what were
you arrested for?

23:42.130 --> 23:43.197
Uh, jaywalking?
Murder?

23:43.264 --> 23:44.832
- [Imitates buzzer]
- Spill it.

23:44.899 --> 23:46.033
Nope, mm-mm.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.635
I will have to remain
a mystery to you.

23:48.703 --> 23:50.504
So, um--

23:50.572 --> 23:52.673
it was a nice date.
Great restaurant.

23:52.740 --> 23:56.176
- I actually picked it myself.
- Did you?

23:56.244 --> 23:58.912
I actually asked
Donna myself.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.549
See, honesty,
I-I love that in a man.

24:07.222 --> 24:09.323
Uh

24:09.390 --> 24:10.891
- Um--
- [Clears throat]

24:10.959 --> 24:15.362
Look, I know that
we joked about not

24:15.430 --> 24:18.365
going home together--

24:22.504 --> 24:26.406
I think
you were right, so--

24:26.474 --> 24:29.076
you know, if we're
gonna do this, let's--

24:29.143 --> 24:31.645
let's do it right.

24:31.713 --> 24:35.115
Okay.
[Sighs]

24:37.886 --> 24:41.488
Yeah.
Let's do it right.

24:47.662 --> 24:50.063
Good night.

24:53.668 --> 24:58.839
[Chuckles]

24:58.907 --> 25:02.342
[Knock at door]

25:02.410 --> 25:03.677
Remind me to move.

25:03.745 --> 25:05.546
No forwarding address.
Come to think of it,

25:05.613 --> 25:07.214
how did you get my address
in the first place?

25:07.282 --> 25:08.782
That's a nice tux.
Where were you tonight?

25:08.850 --> 25:10.884
It's not where I was,
it's where I'm going.

25:10.952 --> 25:13.020
You're going out now?

25:13.087 --> 25:15.188
Oh, I know, it's already
past your bedtime.

25:15.256 --> 25:16.256
- [Laughs]
- Go.

25:16.324 --> 25:17.357
So listen,

25:17.425 --> 25:19.326
everything became clear
tonight, okay?

25:19.394 --> 25:22.029
- I was out with Rachel--
- Oh, gosh, here it comes.

25:22.096 --> 25:24.498
<i>Days of Our Lives.</i>
I'm serious, okay?

25:24.566 --> 25:27.668
I need to--I need to talk
to you about this.

25:27.735 --> 25:31.004
I need to tell you something.
Listen--

25:31.072 --> 25:32.372
I need to make sure that
you understand that I--

25:32.440 --> 25:34.374
Look, I understand.
I think we've covered this.

25:34.442 --> 25:35.976
I'm not interested
in your personal life.

25:36.044 --> 25:39.646
I realize that
because you don't have one.

25:39.714 --> 25:42.049
Oh, yeah, great, you're
an international man of mystery,

25:42.116 --> 25:43.951
but I'm not you,
all right?

25:44.018 --> 25:45.118
I want a personal life.

25:45.186 --> 25:48.488
And I don't want
to be a liar, so...

25:48.556 --> 25:51.758
I'm gonna tell Rachel.
Everything.

25:51.826 --> 25:53.760
No, you're not.

25:53.828 --> 25:56.730
All these lies keep coming
back to haunt me, Harvey.

25:56.798 --> 25:57.798
All right,
I-I can't do it.

25:57.865 --> 25:59.266
I-I can't live my life
that way.

25:59.334 --> 26:00.567
I wanted to tell you,

26:00.635 --> 26:03.236
now you know.

26:03.304 --> 26:07.207
[Chuckles]
Have fun in Monte Carlo.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.475
What the hell
is wrong with you?

26:08.543 --> 26:10.377
- Harvey, please--
- After everything I did

26:10.445 --> 26:12.446
to keep your job, you're just
gonna start spreading it around

26:12.513 --> 26:14.815
that you're a fraud?
I'm not spreading it around.

26:14.882 --> 26:16.617
I'm telling Rachel.
She's on our side.

26:16.684 --> 26:17.784
No, she's not.

26:17.852 --> 26:19.419
Because when you
do something stupid,

26:19.487 --> 26:21.655
which won't take very long,
you don't know what she'll do.

26:21.723 --> 26:23.123
Harvey, I understand--

26:23.191 --> 26:24.825
No, what you fail
to understand

26:24.892 --> 26:26.693
is our firm
is under attack.

26:26.761 --> 26:29.162
And if this gets to Hardman,
we're done.

26:29.230 --> 26:33.266
You, me,
and Jessica.

26:33.334 --> 26:35.736
You want to take down
the firm, Mike?

26:35.803 --> 26:38.005
So you can get laid?

26:38.072 --> 26:39.873
Hey, maybe for you
relationships are all about

26:39.941 --> 26:41.041
getting laid,
but not for me.

26:41.109 --> 26:42.509
I actually care
about her.

26:42.577 --> 26:44.044
Weren't you just
with that other girl last week?

26:44.112 --> 26:45.412
Isn't that what led
to Jessica making me

26:45.480 --> 26:47.514
fire you in the first place?
What are you saying?

26:47.582 --> 26:48.915
You're saying that
I can't date Rachel?

26:48.983 --> 26:51.251
Date Rachel!
Or don't, I don't care.

26:51.319 --> 26:52.919
But you're not
gonna tell her.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.688
I can't be in a relationship
based on a lie.

26:54.756 --> 26:56.390
Then I guess
you have your answer.

26:56.457 --> 26:58.258
But being honest
with her about this?

26:58.326 --> 27:01.361
- That is off the table.
- There is no "about this."

27:01.429 --> 27:03.597
I'm either honest with her,
or I'm not.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.666
You tell her,
and you're done.

27:11.606 --> 27:12.539
[Door closes]

27:21.408 --> 27:22.842
[Knock at door]

27:22.910 --> 27:27.647
I really do need
to move.

27:27.715 --> 27:30.183
I'm telling you, you better
be here to tell me that I was--

27:30.251 --> 27:34.420
Jessica.
Come on in.

27:34.488 --> 27:36.589
I just got a call
from the bank.

27:36.657 --> 27:40.193
And you ran right over
to tell me I was awesome.

27:40.261 --> 27:43.096
You are decidedly
not awesome.

27:43.164 --> 27:44.631
Oh, I beg
to differ.

27:44.698 --> 27:47.367
I just strong-armed one of the
premier financial institutions

27:47.434 --> 27:50.436
in this country into allowing
our client to pursue his dreams.

27:50.504 --> 27:52.539
That's almost
patriotic.

27:52.606 --> 27:54.841
Did you really miss the point
of what I asked you to do,

27:54.909 --> 27:57.577
or can you just
not help being a dick?

27:57.645 --> 27:59.078
My word this time.

27:59.146 --> 28:00.180
Jessica--

28:00.247 --> 28:03.383
Your job was
to make Paul happy,

28:03.450 --> 28:05.685
not take over a case
and do it your way.

28:05.753 --> 28:08.521
- The client's way.
- No, it's the client's way

28:08.589 --> 28:10.290
because you told the client
it could be done.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.858
And I was right!

28:11.926 --> 28:14.360
And yet the experts,

28:14.428 --> 28:17.063
the people I pay
to know bankruptcy

28:17.131 --> 28:18.765
feel that
Paul's client--

28:18.832 --> 28:22.035
oh, yes, Harvey,
Paul's client--

28:22.102 --> 28:23.736
stands to put more money
at risk

28:23.804 --> 28:25.939
when he can get out now
and move on.

28:26.006 --> 28:28.141
This is better.
This is a win-win.

28:28.209 --> 28:32.378
No, it's lose-lose,
and I'm not losing this one.

28:32.446 --> 28:33.947
You are not to pitch this
to the client.

28:34.014 --> 28:36.416
- I can't keep it from him.
- You're not hearing me, Harvey.

28:36.483 --> 28:38.518
This isn't a discussion.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.354
Tell the client
it didn't work.

28:41.422 --> 28:43.389
You tried, you failed.

28:43.457 --> 28:45.658
Move on.

28:45.726 --> 28:47.994
I'm sorry if Paul's ego
is bruised--

28:48.062 --> 28:51.464
This isn't about his ego.
It's about yours.

28:51.532 --> 28:54.234
Make it go away,

28:54.301 --> 28:57.203
and then walk away.

29:10.918 --> 29:12.952
I even told him
about the time I got arrested.

29:13.020 --> 29:16.356
It's crazy, it's like
we can talk about anything.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.458
That's, um--
that's great.

29:18.525 --> 29:19.626
I can tell you're nervous.
Don't be.

29:19.693 --> 29:21.094
We're gonna find
a secret meeting spot

29:21.161 --> 29:22.629
somewhere outside
of the office.

29:22.696 --> 29:26.199
No one here will have
any idea what's going on.

29:26.267 --> 29:28.701
Watch this.

29:28.769 --> 29:30.603
Good morning,
Mr. Ross.

29:30.671 --> 29:33.273
Eh...
Uh, morning.

29:33.340 --> 29:35.642
You still need
some work on that.

29:39.847 --> 29:43.516
Harvey told me.

29:43.584 --> 29:45.652
I know you work for him,
but he's wrong about this.

29:45.719 --> 29:46.819
If he really cared
about me,

29:46.887 --> 29:48.721
he wouldn't be
handing out ultimatums.

29:48.789 --> 29:52.392
Ow.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.194
Do you like
this office?

29:55.262 --> 29:57.630
Sure.

29:57.698 --> 30:00.233
Do you know how much Harvey
likes this office?

30:00.301 --> 30:03.036
Harvey loves
this office.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.471
But for you, he was willing
to give it up.

30:05.539 --> 30:07.974
He's giving me
his office?

30:08.042 --> 30:10.009
How do you think he kept
your job, fraud man?

30:10.077 --> 30:13.479
Hmm? Because Harvey said
it was a package deal.

30:13.547 --> 30:15.481
She fired you,
she fired him.

30:15.549 --> 30:18.985
So before you go mouthing off
about him not caring about you,

30:19.053 --> 30:20.253
you think about that.
Wait a minute.

30:20.321 --> 30:25.892
He did that for me?

30:25.959 --> 30:29.495
[Sighs]
I just--

30:29.563 --> 30:32.298
what--what am I supposed
to say to her?

30:32.366 --> 30:34.701
I mean, Rachel and I are both
finally in the right place.

30:34.768 --> 30:39.339
I told her that I wanted this,
and now--

30:39.406 --> 30:41.107
I'm gonna look like
such an asshole.

30:41.175 --> 30:44.577
Just do it gently.
Firmly, but...

30:44.645 --> 30:47.146
[Sighs]

30:47.214 --> 30:48.815
Gently.

30:48.882 --> 30:54.387
- And--and that's gonna help?
- No, probably not.

30:54.455 --> 30:58.024
How are we even supposed to
work together after that, huh?

31:00.694 --> 31:04.364
It's possible.

31:07.601 --> 31:08.534
It is?

31:08.602 --> 31:13.272
It is.

31:13.340 --> 31:17.977
And how do you get
from here to--

31:18.045 --> 31:21.381
The feelings
just go away.

31:21.448 --> 31:23.616
Eventually.

31:34.962 --> 31:36.396
Can I help you,
Louis?

31:36.463 --> 31:37.697
Jessica, listen, um,

31:37.765 --> 31:39.298
I know you've got
a lot going on right now,

31:39.366 --> 31:41.134
um, but I just wanted
to tell you that I--

31:41.201 --> 31:44.604
Jessica.
We need to talk.

31:44.671 --> 31:47.240
Excuse me.
Hi, I was--

31:47.307 --> 31:52.612
Now.

31:52.679 --> 31:58.351
Never mind,
it can wait.

31:58.419 --> 32:01.220
Yes, Paul?

32:01.288 --> 32:05.525
I want to make sure that you
and I are on the same page.

32:05.592 --> 32:08.261
I gave you and Harvey
an opportunity.

32:08.328 --> 32:10.496
I didn't give you
a client.

32:10.564 --> 32:14.500
I am well aware
of your position, Paul.

32:14.568 --> 32:17.370
If you'll excuse me?
Mm.

32:23.544 --> 32:28.648
[Sighs]

32:28.715 --> 32:29.949
[Door opens]

32:30.017 --> 32:31.117
What?

32:31.185 --> 32:34.987
- Sorry, um--
- Oh, put it right here.

32:35.055 --> 32:40.359
And get out.

32:49.736 --> 32:54.941
Daniel Hardman?
[Chuckles]

33:05.819 --> 33:06.953
The XJS 5000 dictaphone?

33:07.020 --> 33:12.258
How the hell
did he know?

33:12.326 --> 33:16.262
[Laughs]

33:35.482 --> 33:39.285
I heard the bank
came through.

33:39.353 --> 33:43.656
Jessica told me
to tank the deal.

33:43.724 --> 33:45.992
Sucks, doesn't it?

33:46.059 --> 33:49.462
Being told what to do.

33:49.530 --> 33:52.532
What not to do.

33:52.599 --> 33:57.770
What are you gonna do
about what we talked about?

33:57.838 --> 34:00.606
I don't know.

34:00.674 --> 34:02.575
I think
you do know.

34:02.643 --> 34:04.110
I think you know
what's right,

34:04.177 --> 34:07.980
whether I had
to tell you or not.

34:15.789 --> 34:18.056
So, Tom.

34:18.125 --> 34:23.329
Harvey has something
to tell you.

34:23.397 --> 34:27.233
Did you find me
my miracle?

34:27.301 --> 34:30.235
The bank agreed to alter
the terms of the loan.

34:30.304 --> 34:31.370
No balloon payment.

34:31.438 --> 34:32.672
Madison 25 is safe.
No bankruptcy.

34:32.739 --> 34:35.541
Oh, oh, man.
Thank you.

34:35.609 --> 34:38.678
Thank you so much.

34:38.745 --> 34:40.012
Well, Paul.
Mm.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.181
Looks like you found me
the right quarterback

34:42.248 --> 34:43.983
for the fourth quarter.
[Laughs]

34:44.051 --> 34:46.185
I won't forget this.

34:46.253 --> 34:50.489
No, nor will I.

35:09.245 --> 35:12.313
I have been irritated by you,
exasperated with you,

35:12.381 --> 35:14.849
and angry at you,

35:14.917 --> 35:17.752
but I never thought
I'd feel betrayed by you.

35:17.820 --> 35:19.053
I put together
a good deal.

35:19.121 --> 35:20.555
- It was a safe deal--
- I don't care.

35:20.623 --> 35:23.458
You just ensured that a voting
partner would never back me.

35:23.526 --> 35:26.361
If his mother were dying
of cancer and I saved her,

35:26.428 --> 35:27.962
I still wouldn't
get his vote.

35:28.030 --> 35:29.163
I know you're angry,

35:29.231 --> 35:31.065
but I took the restructured deal
to real estate.

35:31.133 --> 35:32.333
That puts them
in your pocket.

35:32.401 --> 35:33.768
Real estate has always been
in my pocket.

35:33.836 --> 35:35.403
It's only you
they hated.

35:35.471 --> 35:36.804
And I'm beginning
to understand why.

35:36.872 --> 35:39.774
- This isn't me against you.
- Hardman is back.

35:39.842 --> 35:42.310
You were the one person
I could trust.

35:42.378 --> 35:43.311
- Jessica--
- I've always known

35:43.379 --> 35:44.512
what you are, Harvey,

35:44.580 --> 35:47.515
and I thought that was
my greatest asset.

35:47.583 --> 35:50.919
Now I'm wondering if you're
not my biggest liability.

35:50.986 --> 35:53.087
This isn't
about bankruptcy.

35:53.155 --> 35:54.556
You're still pissed off
about Mike Ross.

35:54.623 --> 35:57.158
- Damn right I am.
- I offered to walk away.

35:57.226 --> 35:59.327
That offer was bullshit,
and you know it.

35:59.395 --> 36:01.529
You hired that kid
to amuse yourself,

36:01.597 --> 36:03.097
and now I'm vulnerable.

36:03.165 --> 36:05.466
And after everything
that's happened,

36:05.534 --> 36:10.572
you still couldn't put me
ahead of you.

36:10.639 --> 36:12.640
The client asked me
to save his dream.

36:12.708 --> 36:14.108
I did.

36:14.176 --> 36:16.110
You're actually starting
to believe your own bullshit.

36:16.178 --> 36:18.746
- Jessica, come on.
- Just go, Harvey.

36:18.814 --> 36:23.117
I will get past this.
I will move on.

36:23.185 --> 36:26.854
And I will accept that
at the end of the day,

36:26.922 --> 36:30.458
that I am alone
in this.

36:54.483 --> 36:56.951
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:57.019 --> 36:58.052
Four blocks
from the office,

36:58.120 --> 36:59.954
I sort of love
this clandestine thing.

37:00.022 --> 37:01.289
Kind of sexy, right?
[Laughs]

37:01.357 --> 37:03.491
[Laughs]
Oh, thank you.

37:03.559 --> 37:05.259
Look, I was thinking about
what you said last night,

37:05.327 --> 37:07.862
and you're right,
I have been so scared about

37:07.930 --> 37:11.532
taking the LSATs, I know I have.
Rachel, I, uh-

37:11.600 --> 37:14.302
there's something
I need to tell you.

37:14.370 --> 37:18.039
We can't do this
anymore.

37:18.107 --> 37:19.474
Okay.

37:19.541 --> 37:20.742
It's not that
I don't want to--

37:20.809 --> 37:22.076
Wait, where's
this coming from?

37:22.144 --> 37:24.245
Because last night you--eh--
this was all your idea.

37:24.313 --> 37:25.480
- I know.
- So?

37:25.547 --> 37:28.650
Collin McCarthy?

37:28.717 --> 37:30.718
- What about Collin McCarthy?
- You dated him.

37:30.786 --> 37:32.553
- Yeah, I know.
- He was a first-year.

37:32.621 --> 37:34.355
You broke up with him,
and his work went off a cliff,

37:34.423 --> 37:35.857
and then he was fired
two months later.

37:35.924 --> 37:37.125
That's why you don't want
to date someone

37:37.192 --> 37:38.526
from the office, right?
This is ridiculous.

37:38.594 --> 37:39.927
He has nothing to do
with you and me.

37:39.995 --> 37:41.462
But he does.

37:41.530 --> 37:44.966
I know that you and I both
want this, okay, but--

37:45.034 --> 37:48.903
chances are,
I'm gonna screw it up.

37:48.971 --> 37:50.204
I love my job,

37:50.272 --> 37:53.274
and I love--
I love working with you.

37:53.342 --> 37:55.209
And I'm afraid, okay?
I'm afraid that--

37:55.277 --> 37:58.980
that this
will ruin that.

37:59.048 --> 38:00.314
So--

38:00.382 --> 38:06.320
Wow, that was a lot
of words, Mike.

38:06.388 --> 38:08.456
Why don't you just
say it?

38:08.524 --> 38:10.091
You know what, actually,
don't say it.

38:10.159 --> 38:12.260
I can say it for you
because it doesn't take me days

38:12.327 --> 38:13.327
to hear your message.

38:13.395 --> 38:14.896
I hear your message
loud and clear.

38:14.963 --> 38:20.201
I'm just not good enough
for you.

38:32.948 --> 38:37.719
Have Norma send up
a bouquet of flowers,

38:37.786 --> 38:42.790
and make sure that they
repolish the cherrywood.

38:42.858 --> 38:46.394
It's walnut.

38:46.462 --> 38:51.599
I just wanted to make sure
that the place was ready.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.568
I had them
redo the walls.

38:53.635 --> 38:57.572
This is taupe.
Mm.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.707
I want it
to be perfect

38:59.775 --> 39:03.411
for when Daniel
gets back.

39:03.479 --> 39:05.646
You wanted something
this morning.

39:05.714 --> 39:07.715
I'm sorry,
I was rushed.

39:07.783 --> 39:10.418
I'm not now.

39:10.486 --> 39:14.122
Do you still need me?

39:14.189 --> 39:16.591
No.

39:43.085 --> 39:45.286
Checking up on me?

39:45.354 --> 39:46.954
Checking in on you.

39:47.022 --> 39:48.823
Well, don't worry, Harvey.

39:48.891 --> 39:51.592
You were right,
as always.

39:51.660 --> 39:54.061
I don't like having
to tell you to do something

39:54.129 --> 39:55.563
that you don't want
to do.

39:55.631 --> 39:58.232
Why is it that I have to do
everything that you tell me to,

39:58.300 --> 40:02.937
but you can ignore whatever
Jessica tells you to do?

40:03.005 --> 40:05.339
You have plenty of time
to find the right girl, Mike.

40:05.407 --> 40:08.209
[Chuckles]
Well, thank you.

40:08.277 --> 40:10.545
Guess I should get my book,
take some notes.

40:10.612 --> 40:12.747
Harvey Specter's
dating tips.

40:12.815 --> 40:16.584
'Cause I'm sure you told
yourself that at 25 and 30

40:16.652 --> 40:19.120
and 35, and I'm sure you'll be
telling yourself that

40:19.188 --> 40:23.791
when you're 50.

40:23.859 --> 40:29.030
You know
I was right.

40:29.097 --> 40:33.568
Doesn't make it
any better.

41:10.606 --> 41:16.544
[Rattling]

41:26.021 --> 41:28.022
You're not alone
in this.

41:32.694 --> 41:35.930
Put it over there.
