AND I SAID I WOULDN'T
INTERRUPT.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.258
LET'S GO PARK IT
IN THE COMMON ROOM.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.304
WHAT? WAIT.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.001
WHAT IS IT? YOU'RE NOT
SUDDENLY ACTING WEIRD

11:38.001 --> 11:39.611
BECAUSE OF THIS
MAGGIE THING, ARE YOU?

11:39.611 --> 11:42.876
NO.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.921
HUH. MAGGIE SAID YOU'D
BE WEIRD ABOUT THIS.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.054
MAGGIE SAID THAT.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.838
YOU ARE UPSET.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.492
I'M NOT UPSET.
I'M NOT UPSET.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.015
I JUST TOLD YOU
I'M NOT UPSET.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.190
WHAT PART OF THAT
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:53.190 --> 11:55.018
NOTHING.
REPEAT AFTER ME.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.585
NED IS NOT UPSET.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.022
NED IS NOT UPSET.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.329
OK, THEN.

12:44.111 --> 12:46.983
HI. YEAH, I HAVE
AN OLD SAVINGS BOND

12:46.983 --> 12:49.203
THAT I WOULD LIKE
TO LEAVE TO AN INFANT.

12:51.683 --> 12:55.557
WELL, CAN I CASH IT IN
AND LEAVE IT IN HER NAME?

12:55.557 --> 12:57.907
AND HOW LONG WILL
THAT TAKE TO MATURE?

13:00.475 --> 13:03.434
GREAT. AND SHE CAN
DO THAT HERSELF?

13:03.434 --> 13:06.046
OK. I'LL BE THERE
BEFORE YOU CLOSE.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.526
I'LL BE THERE
BEFORE THEN.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.832
THANK YOU.

13:18.710 --> 13:19.886
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT--

13:19.886 --> 13:22.366
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM UPSET.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.804
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT
LAST NIGHT, AND I AM UPSET.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.371
OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS BEEN
GOING ON FOR A WHILE

13:27.371 --> 13:28.982
CAUSE YOU DIDN'T
JUST SAY DATE.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.766
YOU SAID BOYFRIEND.

13:30.766 --> 13:33.421
SO, I GUESS WHAT AM I?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.641
THE ONLY ONE NOT TO KNOW?

13:36.641 --> 13:38.687
I'M NOT HIDING
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.558
I JUST FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT. OK?

13:40.558 --> 13:42.691
AND MAGGIE CERTAINLY
DOESN'T WANT TO SHARE

13:42.691 --> 13:44.171
THIS KIND OF THING
WITH EITHER ONE OF US.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.389
ANYWAY, WHO CARES?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.523
IS HE IN YOUR ROOM
ALL THE TIME?

13:48.523 --> 13:50.220
NO.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.483
SEE, I KNOW SHE'S
TALKING ABOUT ME.

13:52.483 --> 13:53.789
TELLING HIM STUFF
ABOUT US.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.922
NO ONE'S
SAYING ANYTHING.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.011
I JUST DON'T LIKE IT.
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF THE 3 OF YOU

13:58.011 --> 13:59.534
IN THAT ROOM
ALL THE TIME.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.666
AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
NOT THERE. IT--

14:01.666 --> 14:03.146
STUFF GETS SAID.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.974
NED, IF ANYTHING,
HAVING A BOYFRIEND

14:04.974 --> 14:06.671
IS MAKING HER
LESS ANGRY THAN
SHE USED TO BE.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.064
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY
BECOME FRIENDS.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.197
SEE, THAT'S EVEN WORSE.
I HATE THAT.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.113
'CAUSE THEN IT'S REALLY
LIKE THE 3 OF YOU
ALL PALS AND EVERYTHING.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.115
AND ME, I'M OFF ON MY OWN.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.291
THEN SPEND MORE TIME
IN MY ROOM.
IT'LL BE THE 4 OF US.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.989
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO SHARE YOU
WITH ANYONE.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.557
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY THEN.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.601
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.776
MAGGIE HAS A BOYFRIEND,

14:24.776 --> 14:25.952
AND UNLESS
YOU'RE JEALOUS--

14:25.952 --> 14:27.388
COME ON.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.651
THEN DEAL.

14:34.699 --> 14:35.744
OUCH!

14:37.964 --> 14:39.226
HE'S ALL YOURS.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.837
THERE'S HIS, UH,
SHOES AND SOCKS.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.144
DON'T BE EXPECTING A TIP
FROM THAT BATH.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.930
WHAT'S IN THE BAG,
MISS K?

14:47.930 --> 14:50.890
IT'S A SOCK-PUTTER-ONNER.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.717
I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO PUT ON YOUR OWN SOCKS.

14:52.717 --> 14:56.504
I'VE NEVER PUT ON
MY OWN SOCKS BEFORE,
MISS K.

14:56.504 --> 15:01.335
USUALLY MY MOM OR
A NURSE HAS TO DO THAT.
I CAN'T REACH SO GOOD.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.120
YOU SORT OF CATCH IT
OVER YOUR TOES,

15:04.120 --> 15:05.600
AND THEN YOU PULL UP.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.820
LET ME TRY THIS.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.825
HA!

15:14.739 --> 15:16.698
PERFECT.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.446
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO STARVE?

15:25.446 --> 15:27.665
YOU'RE NOT STARVING.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.712
YES, I AM.
AND I'M COLD.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.280
WELL, DO SOME
JUMPING JACKS.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.979
HOW AM I GOING TO DO
JUMPING JACKS TONIGHT
IN MY SLEEPING BAG?

15:36.979 --> 15:38.676
JUST DO THEM, OWE, OK.

15:38.676 --> 15:39.982
I GOT TO GET
THIS SUPPER COOKED

15:39.982 --> 15:40.940
BEFORE IT GETS
DARK OUT HERE.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.729
OWEN!
UH-OH.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.081
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.561
YOU'RE NOT HELPING HERE.

15:53.561 --> 15:56.694
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

15:56.694 --> 15:59.219
OK, LOOK, DON'T PANIC.
COME HERE.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.047
JUST BLOW THE DIRT
OFF OF THAT.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.483
LET ME GET
THIS FIRE STARTED.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.268
EXCUSE ME.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.792
OH, HI.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.012
HI. WE MADE
TOO MUCH FOOD OVER HERE,

16:10.012 --> 16:12.014
AND WE WERE HOPING
MAYBE YOU GUYS
COULD HELP US EAT IT?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.450
WHATCHA GOT?

16:13.450 --> 16:15.409
OWEN,
THAT'S NOT POLITE.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.411
NO, IT'S OK.
WE'RE HAVING SALISBURY STEAK,

16:17.411 --> 16:19.456
POTATOES AU GRATIN,
GREEN BEANS,

16:19.456 --> 16:20.849
AND CHOCOLATE CAKE
FOR DESSERT.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.772
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD
BE HERE AND CLAUDIA

16:30.772 --> 16:32.774
SO THAT IF I LOST
TRACK OF TIME--

16:32.774 --> 16:35.298
LOSING TRACK OF TIME
FOR WHAT?

16:35.298 --> 16:36.604
AGAIN, I WAKE UP
THIS MORNING,

16:36.604 --> 16:37.909
AND YOU'VE ALREADY
LEFT THE HOUSE.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.781
LISTEN, I'M NOT--

16:39.781 --> 16:41.826
I'M FINE WITH
ANY TIME YOU NEED
TO RUN ERRANDS,

16:41.826 --> 16:43.654
BUT IF IT'S GOING
TO MAKE ME LATE,

16:43.654 --> 16:45.439
OR IF I HAVE TO TAKE
THE BABY TO SCHOOL
WITH ME--

16:45.439 --> 16:47.354
YOU SAID THAT THE SCHOOL
WAS OK WITH THAT.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.964
YOU SAID THAT YOU
WERE OK WITH THAT.

16:48.964 --> 16:52.881
YOU JUST GOT TO LET
ME KNOW, DAPHNE, OK?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.535
WHEN YOU'RE GOING
TO GO TO THE BANK

16:54.535 --> 16:55.840
OR WHEREVER THE HELL
IT IS YOU GO.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.972
THE BANK?

16:56.972 --> 17:00.758
YEAH, THEY CALLED.

17:00.758 --> 17:03.152
THEY NEEDED YOUR
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

17:03.152 --> 17:04.980
ON SOME SAVINGS BOND
PAPERWORK.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.242
I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.591
WELL, YOU LEFT IT BLANK.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.811
THEY SAID THEY
NEEDED SOMEONE'S,

17:09.811 --> 17:11.508
ANYONE'S NUMBER
WHO'S BUYING THE BONDS,

17:11.508 --> 17:14.294
SO I GAVE THEM MINE.

17:14.294 --> 17:17.079
THAT'S GOOD, CHARLIE.
THANKS.

17:17.079 --> 17:22.867
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.957
YOUR GIFT, IT MIGHT BE
NICE IF DIANA KNOWS

17:25.957 --> 17:28.786
THAT HER FIRST
INVESTMENT WAS MADE
BY HER MOM, YOU KNOW.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.835
WELL, MY NAME'S ON THERE
SOMEWHERE,I'M SURE.

17:33.835 --> 17:37.317
AND THAT'S 20 YEARS
FROM NOW, CHARLIE.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.538
YOU'RE AT THE BANK
PLANNING 20 YEARS
FROM NOW

17:41.538 --> 17:43.105
AND YOU CAN'T SEEM TO
GIVE ME A DAY'S NOTICE

17:43.105 --> 17:44.193
ABOUT TAKING CARE
OF DIANA.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.065
I AM THINKING.

17:48.502 --> 17:52.767
PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN
I SAY THAT I'M THINKING.

17:52.767 --> 17:57.250
AND IT'S--IT'S
DIANA'S HAPPINESS

17:57.250 --> 17:58.990
THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.564
MAYBE OUR TENT WON'T FIT
2 SLEEPING BAGS, BAILEY.

18:07.564 --> 18:10.176
THEY'LL FIT EVEN IF
I HAVE TO FORCE THEM.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.135
YOU KNOW, THOSE PEOPLE
REALLY HAD A NICE TENT.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.006
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT
AND GO CAMPING

18:15.006 --> 18:16.312
WHEN WE HAVE A TENT
AS NICE AS THEIRS.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.966
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.663
WE CAN'T WAIT
AND GO CAMPING.
WE ARE CAMPING.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.056
THIS IS WHAT YOU
WANTED TO DO, OWEN.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.145
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO HERE.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.887
WE CAN'T FISH.
WE FORGOT OUR HIKING BOOTS.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.671
OK, LOOK.
YOU GOT ME OUT HERE,

18:27.671 --> 18:28.933
AND WE'RE GOING
TO BE OUT HERE

18:28.933 --> 18:30.892
LIKE YOU WANTED US
TO BE, OK?

18:30.892 --> 18:32.894
I'M NOT GETTING IN
THE CAR AND DRIVING
US HOME TONIGHT,

18:32.894 --> 18:35.244
SO JUST
GET USED TO IT.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.986
CAMPING IS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO DO,
OWEN, SO--

18:37.986 --> 18:39.292
I THOUGHT WHEN
WE SAID CAMPING--

18:39.292 --> 18:42.904
NO, THIS IS CAMPING.
THIS IS CAMPING.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.820
NOW CLIMB INTO
YOUR SLEEPING BAG
AND GO TO SLEEP.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.999
YOU'RE MEAN, BAILEY.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.576
Julia: WHAT ARE WE
DOING HERE?

19:02.576 --> 19:04.143
I KNOW IT'S
NOT PERFECT YET.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.188
IT'S KIND OF IN ITS
PRE-LOVE SHACK STATE,

19:06.188 --> 19:10.149
BUT I'VE GOT AN OLD
ORIENTAL RUG IN STORAGE

19:10.149 --> 19:12.760
AND A LINE ON
A DOUBLE BED.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.022
WAIT,
IS THIS FOR YOU?

19:15.937 --> 19:16.851
IT'S FOR YOU.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.202
FOR US.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.987
HA HA.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.206
BUT I DON'T NEED
A NEW ROOM.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.555
YES, YOU DO.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.557
WE NEED YOU TO HAVE
YOUR OWN ROOM.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.168
ONE WITH
SOME PRIVACY.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.605
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU CAN'T BE--

19:34.260 --> 19:37.437
ARE YOU STILL
STUCK ON THIS WHOLE
MAGGIE'S BOYFRIEND THING?

19:37.437 --> 19:38.699
NO.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.962
YES, YOU ARE.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.225
YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH
KEEPING ME AWAY FROM THEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:43.225 --> 19:44.444
NED, THIS IS GETTING
A LITTLE WEIRD.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.707
WHY? NO, IT'S NOT.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.231
AND THAT IS NOT
A VERY NICE THING TO SAY.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.190
NED--YOU CANNOT TELL ME YOU PREFER

19:51.190 --> 19:52.843
TO SHARE YOUR ROOM
WITH ANOTHER COUPLE.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.845
YOU'D RATHER WORRY
ABOUT MONKEYS ON DOORKNOBS

19:54.845 --> 19:56.891
AND WHO GETS DIBS
ON SATURDAY NIGHT

19:56.891 --> 20:01.809
THAN HAVE A PLACE
WHERE WE CAN BE ALONE
WHENEVER WE WANT.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.246
AM I WRONG HERE?

20:04.246 --> 20:06.335
AM I CRAZY?

20:06.335 --> 20:08.381
OK, SO WHY DON'T YOU
GET A SINGLE?

20:08.381 --> 20:11.035
BECAUSE I CAN'T.
THE WAITING LIST FOR
A GUY TO GET A SINGLE

20:11.035 --> 20:13.168
IS, LIKE, WAY INTO
THE NEXT MILLENNIUM.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.257
I MEAN, EVEN
GETTING THIS PLACE
WAS NO PIECE OF CAKE.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.912
BUT I--I LIKE MY ROOM.

20:17.912 --> 20:21.002
AND I LIKE MY ROOMMATE.

20:21.002 --> 20:24.875
I JUST THINK THAT
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE
DISCUSSED THIS FIRST.

20:24.875 --> 20:28.879
SINCE WHEN DO YOU DISCUSS
A GIFT WITH SOMEONE?

20:32.187 --> 20:33.667
OK, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

20:35.843 --> 20:36.931
FINE.

20:39.325 --> 20:43.372
AS LONG AS YOU CALL
THE BUILDING MANAGER
OR I LOSE MY DEPOSIT, OK?

20:43.372 --> 20:44.808
TELL ME YOU'LL
CALL HIM, PLEASE?

20:44.808 --> 20:47.071
OK.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.865
HERE WE GO.
WE'LL GET THIS OFF.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.172
ALL RIGHT.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.394
CLAUD, CAN YOU GRAB ME
SOME MORE DIAPERS?

21:05.394 --> 21:07.657
THERE'S EXTRAS IN
THE BOTTOM DRAWERS
IN THE BATHROOM.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.840
THAT'S NOT WHERE DAPHNE
PUT THESE THE OTHER DAY.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.886
ALONG WITH THE OTHER
50 MILLION.

21:18.886 --> 21:19.843
50 MILLION WHAT?

21:27.024 --> 21:30.854
WHY WOULD SHE BE
BUYING ALL THIS STUFF
AND JUST--

21:30.854 --> 21:32.465
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

21:38.819 --> 21:40.299
[GRUNTS]

21:40.299 --> 21:41.735
HEY, GUYS.

21:43.998 --> 21:48.045
THAT LIGHT RAIN
YOU PREDICTED
LAST NIGHT

21:48.045 --> 21:50.526
HALF BLEW DOWN
THE TENT.

21:50.526 --> 21:53.877
BARELY GOT IT
BACK UP BEFORE
THE MONSOON STRUCK.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.749
WELL, WE DIDN'T SLEEP
SO GREAT, EITHER.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.925
WHAT, THE CENTRAL HEAT
IN YOUR TENT GO OUT?

21:57.925 --> 21:59.753
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.972
ACTUALLY, KAREN WAS
PRETTY MUCH AWAKE
ALL NIGHT.

22:01.972 --> 22:05.149
SHE GETS NIGHTMARES.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.108
DOES OWEN GET NIGHTMARES?

22:07.108 --> 22:09.806
HE DOESN'T NEED THEM.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.287
CAMPING WITH ME HAS BEEN
ENOUGH OF A NIGHTMARE.

22:12.287 --> 22:15.551
YOU KNOW, I SEE YOU
TRYING REAL HARD.

22:15.551 --> 22:16.944
I MEAN,
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.946
KIDS ARE A LOT
TO DEAL WITH

22:18.946 --> 22:21.296
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT
A LOT TO DEAL WITH.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.995
OWEN SURE HAS
A LOT TO DEAL WITH.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.345
HE'S GOT A SITUATION
BACK HOME

22:26.345 --> 22:27.998
WHERE HE LIVES
WITH OUR BROTHER--

22:31.045 --> 22:34.570
LET'S JUST SAY,
YEAH, HE HAS
A LOT TO DEAL WITH.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.705
KAREN, TOO?

22:38.705 --> 22:40.054
SHE DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE--

22:40.054 --> 22:41.142
YEAH. HA HA.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.928
SHE GETS NIGHTMARES.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.930
I WAS AFRAID
YOU HEARD THEM.

22:46.930 --> 22:51.152
NO. I WAS AFRAID YOU
WERE GOING TO HEAR US.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.154
ME AND OWEN,
SLOSHING AROUND,

22:53.154 --> 22:56.070
FIGHTING WITH
EACH OTHER.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.072
[SIGHS] HE HATES ME
RIGHT NOW.

22:58.072 --> 23:00.988
NOTHING I DID
WAS RIGHT.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.163
BEEN THERE.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.643
AM THERE.

23:03.643 --> 23:08.430
HE'S COLD AND BORED
AND MISERABLE.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.127
AND HE'S REALLY
WORKING ME OVER

23:10.127 --> 23:12.347
ABOUT THE 5 STICKS
OF GUM WE HAD
FOR BREAKFAST.

23:12.347 --> 23:16.264
LOOK, WHY DON'T KAREN AND I
MAKE ROOM IN OUR TENT
FOR YOU GUYS?

23:16.264 --> 23:19.876
SERIOUSLY, IT'LL BE COZY,
BUT AT LEAST HE'LL BE
WARM AND DRY.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.008
COME ON,
WE'LL MAKE HOT DOGS.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.749
GO LOOK AT STARS LATER.

23:22.749 --> 23:23.924
YOU MEAN TONIGHT?
TONIGHT.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.099
NO.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.143
COME ON.NO.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.145
I GOT TO GET HIM HOME.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.017
GET HIM DRIED OUT

23:30.017 --> 23:31.801
AND HOPE
THAT SNEEZE HE HAS

23:31.801 --> 23:33.847
DOESN'T TURN INTO
FULL-BLOWN PNEUMONIA.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.808
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
PACK UP AND GO HOME,

23:38.808 --> 23:40.506
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:40.506 --> 23:41.985
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS YOU
TO GIVE UP LIKE THAT,

23:41.985 --> 23:43.596
EVEN IF HE'S
ASKING YOU TO.

23:45.380 --> 23:48.296
I THINK HE WANTS YOU
TO MAKE IT GREAT.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.090
I THOUGHT WE WERE
WORKING STUFF OUT.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.049
WE WERE.

24:02.049 --> 24:06.445
WE ARE. I JUST THOUGHT
WITH YOU AND HENRY
AND ME AND NED,

24:06.445 --> 24:08.447
A LITTLE PRIVACY
MIGHT BE A GOOD THING.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.100
DID NED ASK YOU
TO DO THIS?

24:11.188 --> 24:14.714
NO. NO.
WE BOTH DECIDED

24:14.714 --> 24:16.585
IT WOULD BE LESS
AWKWARD THIS WAY.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.326
I GUESS.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.023
IT JUST SEEMS WEIRD.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.983
I MEAN, YOUR NEW PLACE
IS KIND OF FAR AWAY AND...

24:22.983 --> 24:25.072
YOU HAVE ALL THESE
FRIENDS HERE.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.161
AND...I DON'T KNOW.

24:27.161 --> 24:31.121
I MEAN, HALF OF OUR LIFE
IS IN THIS DORM.

24:31.121 --> 24:35.169
I KNOW. SO I'M GIVING
SOME STUFF UP.
I REALIZE THAT.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.518
NO KIDDING.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.216
PLUS I WAS KIND OF
LOOKING FORWARD

24:39.216 --> 24:41.262
TO US GETTING BACK
TO BEING FRIENDS.

24:41.262 --> 24:46.093
WE WILL BE FRIENDS.
COME ON.

24:46.093 --> 24:49.270
I KNOW THIS IS A NONE OF
MY BUSINESS KIND OF THING,

24:49.270 --> 24:53.056
BUT MOVING INTO A SINGLE
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

24:53.056 --> 24:56.103
WHAT HAPPENED TO COLLEGE?

24:56.103 --> 24:57.844
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
BEING MARRIED,

24:57.844 --> 24:59.715
AND YOU DID THAT
LAST YEAR.

25:03.023 --> 25:06.026
YOU'VE BEEN AN ANGEL
WITH MIKE.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.637
I COULD SLEEP BETTER
KNOWING SOMEBODY
LIKE YOU WAS HERE.

25:08.637 --> 25:12.467
OH, I--
HE'S A WONDERFUL BOY.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.252
LET'S GO HOME.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.342
WHERE'S MY WOMAN NOW?

25:18.342 --> 25:20.127
THERE YOU ARE.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.393
[SIGHS]

25:25.393 --> 25:28.135
ARE YOU GOING TO BEHAVE?

25:28.135 --> 25:32.095
DO YOUR EXERCISES AND--

25:43.977 --> 25:45.456
BYE.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.461
♪ I'M GOING HOME ♪

25:50.461 --> 25:51.724
♪ I'M GOING HOME ♪

25:51.724 --> 25:53.029
SEE YOU LATER, CHUMP.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.700
GOES WITH THE JOB,
I GUESS.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.883
I MUST BE LOOKING AT
A PLANE OR SOMETHING

26:20.883 --> 26:22.058
'CAUSE THERE'S WAY
TOO MUCH COLOR GOING ON

26:22.058 --> 26:23.364
FOR THAT TO BE A PLANET.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.583
YOU SEE IT?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.367
THAT'S SATURN, DUMMY?

26:26.367 --> 26:28.064
TERESA'S GOT IT
ALL SET UP

26:28.064 --> 26:29.718
SO YOU CAN
SEE THE RINGS.

26:29.718 --> 26:34.070
WOW, THIS IS COOL.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.595
DID YOU EVEN KNOW STUFF
LIKE THAT WAS UP THERE?

26:36.595 --> 26:37.987
Karen: I KNEW.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.209
Bailey: I'M SORRY.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.645
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE ASLEEP.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.646
NOPE.

26:44.646 --> 26:45.995
NOT YET.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.606
SORRY. WE'LL KEEP IT
DOWN OVER HERE.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.872
SHH.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.265
BAILEY, DO YOU THINK
THERE'S MORE COOL
STUFF LIKE SATURN,

26:55.265 --> 26:56.876
THAT WE COULD SEE?

26:56.876 --> 26:59.313
WELL, YEAH, THERE'S
ALL THE OTHER PLANETS.

26:59.313 --> 27:04.100
THERE'S MARS AND PLUTO...

27:04.100 --> 27:05.711
AND GOOFY.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.277
[BOTH LAUGH]

27:07.277 --> 27:08.931
IT'S NOT A PLANET.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.019
GOOFY'S A DOG.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.543
I'M TEASING YOU, PAL.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.067
I KNOW.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.808
BAILEY...
MM-HMM.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.723
WHEN YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT COOL STUFF,

27:17.723 --> 27:19.202
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW

27:19.202 --> 27:21.030
SO WE CAN SEE IT
TOGETHER?

27:21.030 --> 27:24.251
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
JUST PLANETS.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.297
I'M MAKING A LIST ALREADY.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.650
CHECK IT OUT.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.565
WHOA!

27:34.565 --> 27:37.525
SOMEDAY YOU'LL GO
TO NEW YORK...

27:37.525 --> 27:38.918
AND PARIS.

27:38.918 --> 27:41.529
NOT THAT I'VE EVER
BEEN TO EITHER,

27:41.529 --> 27:42.922
BUT YOU WILL.

27:42.922 --> 27:46.969
AND THERE'LL BE
ALL THESE FRENCH GUYS.

27:46.969 --> 27:50.973
BUT YOU'LL KNOW HOW TO
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

27:50.973 --> 27:54.411
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT YOU AT ALL.

27:54.411 --> 27:57.414
AND THEN COLLEGE
IS A BIG THING.

27:57.414 --> 28:00.896
YOU'RE GONNA BE COLLEGE
MATERIAL, DEFINITELY.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.769
AND YOU'LL WEAR ONE OF
THOSE BUSINESS SUITS,

28:03.769 --> 28:06.728
AND YOU'LL CARRY
ONE OF THOSE, LIKE,

28:06.728 --> 28:08.774
POCKETBOOK
BRIEFCASE THINGS

28:08.774 --> 28:11.733
THAT COST,
LIKE, 1,000 BUCKS.

28:11.733 --> 28:16.738
HEY, YOU'LL BE LIKE
A LAWYER OR SOMETHING.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.132
YEAH.

28:19.132 --> 28:22.657
AND CHARLIE
WILL BE SO PROUD.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.270
POOR CHARLIE.

28:28.750 --> 28:29.708
HEY.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.929
OH, HEY.

28:35.670 --> 28:36.889
POOR CHARLIE?

28:38.064 --> 28:41.458
I WAS JUST
TALKING TO HER.

28:46.115 --> 28:50.076
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
PUT HER DOWN AND
LET HER GET SOME SLEEP?

28:50.076 --> 28:52.165
GET SOME SLEEP
FOR YOURSELF.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.080
IT'S OK.

28:54.080 --> 28:58.693
I'M NOT FINISHED
TELLING HER ABOUT...

28:58.693 --> 29:00.782
BOYS...

29:00.782 --> 29:03.916
AND THE BACK SEATS
OF CARS,

29:03.916 --> 29:07.746
AND TO STAY AWAY
FROM PEOPLE WHO STARE.

29:09.878 --> 29:10.792
LIKE THAT.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.190
AND I LIKE WATCHING HER.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.757
OK.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.240
GOOD NIGHT.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.025
GOOD NIGHT.

29:46.697 --> 29:48.656
SHE WAS SAYING
GOOD-BYE.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.571
TO DIANA?

29:53.922 --> 29:54.793
YEAH.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.187
AND ME.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.887
SHE'S LEAVING US.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.932
ARE YOU SURE?
HOW CAN YOU--

30:03.932 --> 30:05.325
I'M SURE, OK?

30:05.325 --> 30:07.240
I'VE BEEN REPLAYING
EVERYTHING.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.372
I MEAN, THE SAVINGS BOND,

30:09.372 --> 30:15.335
THE WAY SHE BOUGHT
ALL THAT STUFF LIKE
SHE WAS STOCKPILING FOR...

30:15.335 --> 30:16.466
FOR FOREVER.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.904
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING?

30:18.904 --> 30:20.557
LIKE WHAT?

30:20.557 --> 30:23.473
LIKE, "I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
DAPHNE"?

30:23.473 --> 30:25.824
"AND I WANT YOU TO STAY."
YEAH, LIKE THAT.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.174
I DIDN'T...

30:28.174 --> 30:30.045
I COULDN'T. I'M...

30:32.569 --> 30:35.224
I'M NOT SURE THAT
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

30:35.224 --> 30:39.098
I MEAN, IF STAYING
WERE WHAT SHE WANTED,

30:39.098 --> 30:40.490
BUT IT'S NOT.

30:40.490 --> 30:43.102
IT ISN'T. I CAN SEE IT.

30:43.102 --> 30:46.148
AND I'M JUST...
I'M TIRED, KIRSTEN.

30:46.148 --> 30:49.412
I'M TRYING TO MAKE HER
ACT LIKE A MOTHER FOR DIANA

30:49.412 --> 30:51.545
WHEN SHE DOESN'T FEEL IT.

30:51.545 --> 30:55.375
OF BEING AFTER HER
TO WANT SOMETHING
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT.

30:58.117 --> 31:01.076
I'M JUST...TIRED.

31:03.687 --> 31:05.951
ARE YOU GONNA
LET HER GO?

31:09.302 --> 31:10.564
I DON'T KNOW.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.309
WHERE ARE ALL THE BOXES
AND EVERYTHING?

31:16.309 --> 31:18.311
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE
BEEN DONE BY NOW.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.703
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.705
WE CAN TALK AND PACK
AT THE SAME TIME.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.316
SO COME ON.
HELP ME OUT.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.317
NED.

31:24.317 --> 31:25.971
NED, LISTEN, UM...

31:25.971 --> 31:27.450
MAGGIE AND I HAD
A REALLY GOOD TALK,

31:27.450 --> 31:29.800
AND I'VE DECIDED
I DON'T WANNA MOVE.

31:29.800 --> 31:33.543
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DEAL WITH 2 BOYFRIENDS
IN ONE ROOM.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.154
I'M MAKING FRIENDS HERE.

31:35.154 --> 31:37.330
AND MOVING IS
SUCH A NIGHTMARE.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.809
WE'VE ALREADY
DECIDED THIS, JULIA.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.115
I PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.769
NONREFUNDABLE,
AT THIS POINT.

31:41.769 --> 31:44.380
I MEAN, NOW WE'LL BE
ABLE TO BE TOGETHER.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.034
ALONE. YOU AND ME.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.689
SO GRAB A BOX.
DO YOUR DESK.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.691
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

31:50.691 --> 31:54.042
WOULD YOU STOP BULLYING
AND LISTEN TO ME?

31:54.042 --> 31:56.044
NOW, I KNOW
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT,

31:56.044 --> 31:58.046
I DON'T KNOW,
BEING THE ODD MAN OUT
OR WHATEVER,

31:58.046 --> 32:00.179
BUT MAGGIE IS BEING
REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS--

32:00.179 --> 32:02.877
I THINK I KNOW MAGGIE
A LITTLE BETTER
THAN YOU.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.879
AND WE'RE
UNDER A DEADLINE HERE,

32:04.879 --> 32:06.925
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
HOW ABOUT PITCHING IN
AND HELPING OUT?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.449
NO, NED.
NO, I DO MIND.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.581
THIS IS MY ROOM,
AND IT'S STILL MY LIFE,

32:11.581 --> 32:14.062
AND I'M NOT HAVING ANYONE
TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO DO!

32:14.062 --> 32:15.585
NO, THIS WAS YOUR ROOM,
AND IT'S OUR LIVES,

32:15.585 --> 32:17.979
AND I'M SAYING
PACK YOUR STUFF NOW!

32:19.067 --> 32:19.938
NO.

32:21.591 --> 32:22.810
HEY, WOULD YOU JUST...

32:22.810 --> 32:23.942
CUT IT OUT?!

32:23.942 --> 32:25.595
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:25.595 --> 32:27.119
GIVE ME THAT!

32:27.119 --> 32:28.468
NED, WOULD YOU PLEASE--

32:28.468 --> 32:30.165
JULIA!

33:09.204 --> 33:12.686
SO AFTER MY GIRLFRIEND
SET ME UP WITH THIS GUY,

33:12.686 --> 33:15.602
SHE TOLD ME WHAT HE
LOVED SO MUCH ABOUT
HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND

33:15.602 --> 33:16.995
WERE HER ANKLES.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.648
AND I WAS LIKE...

33:18.648 --> 33:20.694
MY ANKLES
ARE MY MOTHER'S ANKLES.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.652
NOT SOMETHING YOU
PUT LITTLE CHAINS
OF HEARTS AROUND,

33:22.652 --> 33:24.654
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

33:24.654 --> 33:26.308
CAN I BORROW
A LITTLE POWDER?

33:26.308 --> 33:27.396
SURE.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.400
BUT I WAS THINKING,
THERE WAS THIS GUY
ONE TIME,

33:31.400 --> 33:33.228
AND HE WAS, LIKE,

33:33.228 --> 33:35.622
"HEY, YOU COULD
SWEEP THE FLOOR
WITH THOSE EYELASHES."

33:35.622 --> 33:41.193
SO I FIGURE I'M JUST HAVING
TO WORK WITH WHAT GOD
AND MAYBELLINE GIVE ME.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.195
THANK YOU.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.587
HEY, YOU KEEP IT.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.590
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE IT.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.593
I MEAN, IT'S NOT CHANEL
OR ANYTHING.

33:50.593 --> 33:53.205
WELL, HERE WE GO.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.467
WISH ME LUCK.

34:26.238 --> 34:27.891
AH-CHOO!

34:30.677 --> 34:33.419
HERE.

34:33.419 --> 34:37.292
NOW, LISTEN, WHEN
CHARLIE ASKS YOU WHERE
YOU GOT THAT COLD...

34:37.292 --> 34:40.556
I TELL HIM IT'S
'CAUSE THE FIRST NIGHT
WE SLEPT IN THE RAIN.

34:40.556 --> 34:41.470
RIGHT.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.128
AND...

34:47.128 --> 34:50.088
MAYBE WE DON'T EVEN
TELL HIM ABOUT
THE SECOND NIGHT.

34:50.088 --> 34:55.136
OH, YOU MEAN NOT SAY
THAT WE HAD TO SLEEP
WITH THOSE WOMEN?

34:55.136 --> 34:58.096
WE DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH THOSE WOMEN.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.881
NOT IN...IN THE...

35:00.881 --> 35:02.491
SLEEPING WITH WAY.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.885
I WAS SLEEPING.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.191
YOU WERE SNORING.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.192
OK.

35:07.192 --> 35:10.325
WHAT I MEAN IS...

35:10.325 --> 35:15.287
USUALLY WHEN
ADULTS SAY THAT
THEY SLEPT TOGETHER,

35:15.287 --> 35:17.202
THEY MEAN
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.247
LIKE KISSING?

35:19.247 --> 35:21.119
KISSING'S
A BIG PART OF IT.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.078
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT,
BAILEY.

35:31.868 --> 35:34.741
YOU COULD CALL MICHAEL
IF YOU WANT TO.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.267
NO. DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D WANT TO.

35:39.267 --> 35:42.444
HE'S WITH HIS FAMILY,
AND THAT'S GREAT.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.142
IT'S...

35:44.142 --> 35:45.621
WE'RE A FAMILY,
YOU AND ME.

35:45.621 --> 35:46.970
WE ARE.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.320
BUT IT DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE IT.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.886
PAUL, WHAT ARE YOU--

35:49.886 --> 35:51.627
JUST LET ME SAY THIS.

35:51.627 --> 35:54.456
WE DON'T FEEL
LIKE A FAMILY
TO YOU BECAUSE--

35:54.456 --> 35:55.979
KIRSTEN,
SAY WHAT YOU WANNA SAY--

35:55.979 --> 35:57.894
A FAMILY TO YOU
HAS KIDS IN IT.

35:57.894 --> 36:01.246
AND IT DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE A FAMILY TO ME
BECAUSE...

36:01.246 --> 36:02.986
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.988
AND I WANT YOU HAPPY.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.295
IF I'M NOT HAPPY,

36:07.295 --> 36:09.863
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

36:09.863 --> 36:13.301
NO, I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS.
THAT'S MY POINT.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.216
WHATEVER I SAID
IN THE PAST,

36:15.216 --> 36:16.478
WHATEVER WE'VE SAID,

36:16.478 --> 36:19.264
I NEED TO GIVE YOU
A BABY.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.527
WE NEED
TO ADOPT A CHILD.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.225
KIRSTEN?

36:24.225 --> 36:26.271
NO. I...

36:26.271 --> 36:27.576
I HEARD YOU.

36:27.576 --> 36:28.447
IT'S JUST...

36:30.579 --> 36:32.842
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
PAUL?

36:32.842 --> 36:35.628
OPENING A DOOR
THAT WE SHUT.

36:35.628 --> 36:38.196
WE TALKED IT,
AND WE SHUT IT FOR GOOD.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.197
AND NOW...

36:39.197 --> 36:41.242
STOP DOING THIS TO ME!

36:41.242 --> 36:43.549
THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT,
SO STOP DOING IT!

36:43.549 --> 36:45.725
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW NOT TO DO IT

36:45.725 --> 36:50.251
'CAUSE I'VE REALIZED
HOW UNHAPPY YOU WOULD BE
WITHOUT KIDS...

36:50.251 --> 36:54.429
JUST AS I'VE REALIZED
HOW UNHAPPY I WOULD BE

36:54.429 --> 36:55.343
WITHOUT YOU.

37:16.799 --> 37:20.803
ANY PLACE IN PARTICULAR
YOU WANT ME TO PUT THESE?

37:20.803 --> 37:24.677
UM...IN MY DRAWER,
I GUESS.

37:28.202 --> 37:29.116
WHAT?

37:36.863 --> 37:38.473
UHH...

37:38.473 --> 37:41.259
LOOKS LIKE MY SWEATSHIRT
GOT IN THE WASH AGAIN.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.956
IT NEVER CEASES
TO AMAZE ME

37:42.956 --> 37:44.610
HOW MUCH LAUNDRY
THERE IS HERE.

37:44.610 --> 37:45.872
AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE
OF THE BABY, EITHER.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.048
I KNOW YOU'RE LEAVING,
DAPHNE.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.230
CHARLIE...

37:56.230 --> 37:57.579
I KNOW IT.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.803
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
FOR A WHILE, BUT...

38:03.803 --> 38:07.415
BUT NOW I JUST...
I KNOW IT.

38:07.415 --> 38:08.808
AND, UH....

38:08.808 --> 38:10.766
IF IT'S WHAT
YOU WANT, DAPH--

38:10.766 --> 38:13.291
NO. JUST LET ME
SAY THIS.

38:15.815 --> 38:18.121
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS...

38:18.121 --> 38:19.035
IS WHEN...

38:21.211 --> 38:25.172
SO I CAN START TO
FIGURE OUT OUR LIFE
WITHOUT YOU.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.261
MINE AND DIANA'S.

38:28.654 --> 38:30.395
PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

38:30.395 --> 38:34.137
I WASN'T...
HIDING ANYTHING
FROM YOU, CHARLIE.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.880
THAT'S HOW IT FELT.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.406
I WAS, I WAS...

38:41.406 --> 38:45.018
WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT TIME TO LEAVE.

38:45.018 --> 38:49.022
NOT THAT THERE IS EVER
A RIGHT TIME,

38:49.022 --> 38:55.028
BUT IS IT BEFORE HER EYES
CAN FOCUS ON ME,

38:55.028 --> 38:57.900
BEFORE SHE CAN
CALL ME MAMA?

38:57.900 --> 39:00.468
I DON'T KNOW.

39:00.468 --> 39:03.602
ALL I KNOW IS THAT...

39:03.602 --> 39:07.954
THE OTHER DAY,
WE WERE IN THE PARK,

39:07.954 --> 39:09.825
AND SHE STARTED TO CRY.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.483
AND I WALKED AWAY
FROM HER.

39:15.483 --> 39:16.963
NO, LISTEN TO ME.

39:16.963 --> 39:21.576
I WALKED AWAY
BECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT,

39:21.576 --> 39:24.579
IN MY MIND,

39:24.579 --> 39:27.800
DIANA DIDN'T EVEN EXIST.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.412
AND I'M AFRAID...

39:31.412 --> 39:33.458
THAT...

39:33.458 --> 39:37.418
I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE
THE KIND OF MOM

39:37.418 --> 39:40.769
WHO CAN AND WILL
WALK AWAY.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.076
AND THAT IS NOT,

39:43.076 --> 39:47.428
THAT'S NOT THE KIND MOM
THAT DIANA NEEDS.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.387
DIANA OR YOU.

39:51.084 --> 39:56.437
SO THE QUESTION IS NOT
WHEN WILL I LEAVE.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.960
THE TRUTH IS...

40:00.441 --> 40:02.574
I'VE ALREADY LEFT.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.925
DAPH...

40:05.925 --> 40:09.407
JUST DO ONE THING FOR ME
AFTER I GO...

40:13.106 --> 40:15.543
DON'T LET HER HATE ME.

40:25.074 --> 40:27.033
COME ON, JULIA.

40:27.033 --> 40:29.035
WHAT THE HELL.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.384
HEY, IT'S ME.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.038
I, UH...

40:32.038 --> 40:33.431
WHERE ARE YOU?

40:33.431 --> 40:35.389
I'M LOOKING ALL OVER,
AND...

40:35.389 --> 40:37.435
LISTEN, I JUST, UH...

40:37.435 --> 40:40.046
I WANNA TALK ABOUT
THIS MOVING THING.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.309
SO CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET THIS.

40:48.054 --> 40:51.405
NEXT TIME WE'RE GONNA GO
WITH THE RIGHT GEAR.

40:51.405 --> 40:56.105
TARP, BOOTS, STOVE,

40:56.105 --> 40:59.152
AND A NEW TENT
'CAUSE WE BASICALLY
WRECKED OWEN'S.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.154
AND A TELESCOPE.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.417
HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT
WANTING TO LOOK UP
AT THE STARS.

41:03.417 --> 41:04.984
A REALLY BIG TENT

41:04.984 --> 41:07.508
'CAUSE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.078
WHEN WE WERE
SETTING UP THE TENT,

41:12.078 --> 41:16.212
HE KEPT BANGING ME
IN THE HEAD WITH THE POLES.

41:16.212 --> 41:20.086
THEN WE BASICALLY
SLEPT OUT IN THE COLD
ALL NIGHT.

41:22.001 --> 41:24.003
YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:24.003 --> 41:27.310
OWEN IS THE HAPPIEST
I'VE EVER SEEN HIM.

41:27.310 --> 41:31.924
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE,
"BAILEY THIS"
AND "BAILEY THAT".

41:31.924 --> 41:34.274
SO WHATEVER YOU THINK
YOU DID WRONG...

41:34.274 --> 41:35.928
SEE, THAT'S JUST IT.

41:35.928 --> 41:38.321
I LOVED IT, TOO.
I REALLY DID.

41:38.321 --> 41:41.020
AND YOU KNOW THAT I DIDN'T
EVEN WANT TO GO OUT THERE,

41:41.020 --> 41:43.501
AND WE GOT THERE,
AND EVERY WAS GOING WRONG,

41:43.501 --> 41:44.980
AND...

41:44.980 --> 41:46.547
I DON'T KNOW.

41:46.547 --> 41:48.723
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THINGS
CHANGED AROUND, BUT...

41:52.161 --> 41:54.773
NOTHING EVER FELT
BETTER THAN THAT.

41:59.952 --> 42:01.388
NOTHING COULD.

42:08.482 --> 42:10.136
JULIA?

42:10.136 --> 42:12.312
WHAT TIME IS IT?

42:13.487 --> 42:15.097
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.098
LATE.

42:16.098 --> 42:17.012
SORRY.

42:18.492 --> 42:20.189
IT'S OK.

42:20.189 --> 42:22.540
I SAW YOUR SUITCASE
AND BOXES AND STUFF.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.108
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE
COMING BACK HERE TONIGHT.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.022
YEAH.

42:28.894 --> 42:31.070
OH, NED LEFT
A COUPLE MESSAGES.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.114
HE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

42:32.114 --> 42:33.725
DID YOU FIND HIM?

42:33.725 --> 42:35.335
MM-MM. NO.

42:37.772 --> 42:39.774
YOU OK?
YOU SOUND WEIRD.

42:41.689 --> 42:42.560
I'M FINE.

42:44.083 --> 42:46.738
WELL, I'M KINDA UP NOW.

42:46.738 --> 42:51.090
YOU WANT ME TO
TURN ON THE LIGHT
AND WE COULD TALK?

42:51.090 --> 42:53.701
NO. IT'S OK.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

42:53.701 --> 42:54.876
I'M A LITTLE TIRED.

42:56.051 --> 42:56.965
OK.

42:59.707 --> 43:01.143
GOOD NIGHT, JULE.

43:02.275 --> 43:03.755
GOOD NIGHT, MAGGIE.

43:24.297 --> 43:27.213
[CAR APPROACHES,
HORN HONKS]

43:27.213 --> 43:29.868
Man: SOMEBODY CALL A CAB
TO THIS ADDRESS?

43:29.868 --> 43:32.827
Daphne: YEAH. CAN YOU
HELP ME WITH THIS?

43:32.827 --> 43:34.829
JUST THE ONE BAG?

43:34.829 --> 43:36.701
I CAN CARRY
THE BACKPACK.
