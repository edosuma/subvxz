WEBVTT

00:01.320 --> 00:03.555
You're not to try any experiment

00:03.556 --> 00:05.803
you're about to at home.

00:05.804 --> 00:08.288
You heard it, don't do it

00:10.598 --> 00:12.599
on this....

00:13.858 --> 00:15.710
Aha choo....

00:15.711 --> 00:18.804
...Adam and Jamie take on two
common cold conundrums...

00:18.805 --> 00:20.001
Go get cleaned up.

00:20.065 --> 00:21.933
First, they test their limits,

00:22.092 --> 00:25.559
finding out if you sneeze
at 100 miles per hour...

00:25.691 --> 00:26.745
Whoa! That is nasty.

00:26.942 --> 00:28.723
...And over 30 feet.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.692
Oh, it's happening.

00:30.693 --> 00:33.462
Then they investigate if
someone else's runny nose...

00:33.463 --> 00:34.563
That's funny.

00:34.564 --> 00:36.731
...Will eventually catch up to you.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.100
Aah.

00:38.101 --> 00:40.302
Meanwhile, Kari, Grant, and Tory...

00:40.303 --> 00:43.438
It put a big gash,
but it didn't cut his head off.

00:43.439 --> 00:45.407
...Put their necks on the line...

00:45.408 --> 00:47.809
Holy mackerel!
Look at that tornado!

00:47.810 --> 00:51.580
...To find out if a tornado can
turn glass into a guillotine.

00:51.581 --> 00:55.217
All right, here we go in 3, 2, 1.

00:55.218 --> 00:57.152
Tornado!

00:57.153 --> 00:59.754
Tornado!

01:02.258 --> 01:04.092
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:05.061 --> 01:06.928
Adam savage...

01:06.929 --> 01:08.730
Explosives are funny creatures.

01:08.731 --> 01:10.232
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:10.233 --> 01:11.666
Well, there's your problem.

01:11.667 --> 01:12.934
Between them, more than 30 years

01:12.935 --> 01:15.904
of special-effects experience.

01:15.905 --> 01:16.972
Joining them...

01:16.973 --> 01:18.206
whoa! Whoo!

01:18.207 --> 01:19.241
...Kari Byron...

01:19.242 --> 01:20.876
Right tool for the job.

01:20.877 --> 01:21.977
...Tory Belleci...

01:21.978 --> 01:23.678
We only have one shot at this.

01:23.679 --> 01:25.013
...Grant Imahara.

01:25.014 --> 01:26.648
That was a great result!

01:26.649 --> 01:28.850
They don't just tell the myths.

01:28.851 --> 01:31.553
They put them to the test.

01:33.335 --> 01:37.377
***

01:43.299 --> 01:44.366
so, what do you think?

01:44.367 --> 01:45.700
Are we ever gonna run out of myths?

01:45.701 --> 01:46.735
No way, dude.

01:46.736 --> 01:48.537
We are still finding great material

01:48.538 --> 01:50.572
from the most common
sources imaginable.

01:50.573 --> 01:52.274
Like what? The common cold...

01:52.275 --> 01:53.875
specifically, the sneeze,

01:53.876 --> 01:57.279
which supposedly leaves your
mouth at 100 miles an hour

01:57.280 --> 01:59.881
and can travel up to 30 feet,
spreading your germs.

01:59.882 --> 02:02.817
I think both of those are
claims we could put to the test.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.120
And sneezing's not the only
thing you have to worry about.

02:05.121 --> 02:06.421
I mean, if you've got a cold,

02:06.422 --> 02:08.223
you touch your face and
you touch something else,

02:08.223 --> 02:09.357
and before you know it,

02:09.358 --> 02:11.593
you got nasal secretions
all over the place.

02:11.594 --> 02:14.362
Meaning you could supposedly
catch a cold from someone

02:14.363 --> 02:16.865
without having any physical
contact with them whatsoever.

02:16.866 --> 02:18.466
Common-cold myths... let's do it.

02:18.467 --> 02:19.467
Okay.

02:19.468 --> 02:21.469
Ah-choo!

02:21.470 --> 02:24.639
That's two feverish
fables to tackle.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.242
First up, the physics of a sneeze.

02:27.243 --> 02:31.079
Does snot really rocket at
speeds of 100 miles per hour

02:31.080 --> 02:34.616
and spread disease over 30 feet?

02:34.617 --> 02:36.218
Let's start with the sneeze.

02:36.219 --> 02:37.485
How do you want to tackle it?

02:37.486 --> 02:39.287
That one's pretty
straightforward to me.

02:39.288 --> 02:41.723
I mean, a sneeze is supposed
to travel at 100 miles an hour.

02:41.724 --> 02:44.359
Let's test it by firing
up the high-speed camera

02:44.360 --> 02:45.694
and using a little math.

02:45.695 --> 02:46.861
What about distance?

02:46.862 --> 02:48.997
Distance is a little tougher.

02:48.998 --> 02:51.099
I mean, we're gonna
have to be tracking

02:51.100 --> 02:53.602
what have to be freaking
tiny droplets of liquid

02:53.603 --> 02:54.636
up to 30 feet away?

02:54.637 --> 02:56.204
I've got some ideas about that.

02:56.205 --> 02:57.872
You worry about inducing a sneeze,

02:57.873 --> 02:59.541
and I'll worry about measuring it.

02:59.542 --> 03:00.942
Fair enough. All right.

03:02.545 --> 03:05.780
According to public-safety
announcements through the ages,

03:05.781 --> 03:09.017
the power of the sneeze is potent.

03:09.018 --> 03:13.722
Remember, sneezes can travel
at over 100 miles per hour

03:13.723 --> 03:16.992
and spread contagion over 30 feet.

03:16.993 --> 03:21.096
But are those formidable
figures really true?

03:21.097 --> 03:22.330
To find out,

03:22.331 --> 03:24.699
first, they'll clock
the speed of a sneeze

03:24.700 --> 03:27.936
on a high-speed camera and
then track its distance.

03:27.937 --> 03:31.439
So, for that, Adam creates
a sneeze shooting range.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.375
Oh, hey. Check it out. Wow.

03:33.376 --> 03:36.778
I think that's the biggest and
fanciest gauge we've made.

03:36.779 --> 03:38.113
Yep. Well, 30 feet...

03:38.114 --> 03:40.415
supposed distance that
a sneeze can travel.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.484
Looks like it ought
to be up to snuff.

03:42.485 --> 03:43.718
Ha ha ha!

03:45.388 --> 03:49.457
And speaking of snuff,
Adam's got just the stuff.

03:49.458 --> 03:50.592
How are we gonna sneeze?

03:50.593 --> 03:51.693
Well, if you remember

03:51.694 --> 03:53.662
the "sneezing with your
eyes open" episode,

03:53.663 --> 03:57.565
it's actually caused us
some real difficulty.

03:57.566 --> 03:59.768
However, we have found
a foolproof method

03:59.769 --> 04:02.070
for this episode,
and that is tobacco snuff.

04:02.071 --> 04:04.139
The snuff will work

04:04.140 --> 04:07.142
to irritate the mucosa at
the back of Adam's nose,

04:07.143 --> 04:09.968
which will bring on
a semi-autonomous,

04:09.969 --> 04:12.047
convulsive expulsion
of air from the lungs

04:12.048 --> 04:13.715
through the nose and mouth...

04:13.716 --> 04:14.783
Ah-choo!

04:14.784 --> 04:16.517
...Or, a sneeze.

04:17.486 --> 04:19.254
Ah.

04:19.255 --> 04:21.923
Little snuff for science.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:31.867 --> 04:33.968
There we go.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.905
And another one......

04:36.906 --> 04:38.306
for good measure.

04:38.307 --> 04:39.407
Whoo!

04:41.010 --> 04:42.644
Whoa, that is nasty!

04:42.645 --> 04:46.448
Nasty and captured by
the high-speed camera

04:46.449 --> 04:50.051
at a stomach-churning
3,000 frames per second.

04:50.052 --> 04:52.454
And that stuff's made to snort,
huh? - It is.

04:52.455 --> 04:55.223
I have no idea why anyone
would do it recreationally.

04:55.224 --> 04:56.624
Well, let's see how
fast it went. Okay.

04:58.294 --> 05:00.295
By counting the number of frames

05:00.296 --> 05:03.431
it takes a snot droplet
to travel 1 foot,

05:03.432 --> 05:06.568
they work out the speed
of Adam's sneeze.

05:06.569 --> 05:08.055
Oh, wow. You know what?

05:08.056 --> 05:10.538
Watching it go backwards
is really pretty sickening.

05:10.539 --> 05:11.706
Okay.

05:11.707 --> 05:15.710
51 feet per second
times .68 equals...

05:15.711 --> 05:17.746
35 miles per hour.

05:17.747 --> 05:19.581
That's not 100 miles an hour.

05:19.582 --> 05:21.916
That's nowhere close
to 100 miles an hour.

05:21.917 --> 05:23.718
I should have a go. All right.

05:24.678 --> 05:25.928
Watch for the 'stache.

05:25.929 --> 05:30.731
35 miles per hour is certainly
not the mythical 100,

05:30.732 --> 05:32.500
so Jamie steps up.

05:36.738 --> 05:39.874
Once again, the snuff
squeezes a sneeze,

05:39.875 --> 05:42.176
but will it be faster?

05:42.177 --> 05:44.478
Oh, look at that 'stache!

05:44.479 --> 05:47.748
Like Indiana farmland
in the breeze, isn't it?

05:47.749 --> 05:49.784
Getting quite poetic here,
aren't we?

05:50.986 --> 05:52.453
The subject matter.

05:52.454 --> 05:56.557
57 feet per second...

05:56.558 --> 06:00.595
Times .68 equals...

06:00.596 --> 06:02.964
39 miles per hour.

06:02.965 --> 06:04.899
Still nowhere near 100, huh?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.267
Nope. You busted out.

06:06.268 --> 06:08.336
You beat me in the
speed department,

06:08.337 --> 06:10.371
but it's nowhere close to the myth.

06:10.372 --> 06:13.708
Well, apparently,
I sneeze at 35 miles per hour,

06:13.709 --> 06:16.544
and the Hyneman sneezes
at 39 miles per hour.

06:16.545 --> 06:19.947
Neither of those is remotely
close to 100 miles an hour,

06:19.948 --> 06:22.249
so that myth, I think,
is pretty busted.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.251
Now we're on to distance.

06:24.252 --> 06:26.120
Does a sneeze really
travel 30 feet?

06:26.121 --> 06:28.422
And I think Mr.
Hyneman already has some ideas

06:28.423 --> 06:29.624
about how to track that.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.393
When Adam sneezes,
we need to see how far

06:32.394 --> 06:35.363
the stuff that comes out
of his nose travels,

06:35.364 --> 06:37.865
and so, to do that, I'm gonna add

06:37.866 --> 06:41.168
this cherry-flavored
red kids drink mix

06:41.169 --> 06:43.037
to the snuff that he inhales,

06:43.038 --> 06:44.372
and when he sneezes,

06:44.373 --> 06:46.841
hopefully,
we'll see little red dots

06:46.842 --> 06:48.943
on this lovely strip
of white paper.

06:48.944 --> 06:50.578
This time, Adam's sneeze

06:50.579 --> 06:55.116
should leave a telltale trail
of cherry-colored tracks.

06:56.318 --> 06:58.285
Oh!

06:58.286 --> 06:59.754
Ugh!

06:59.755 --> 07:03.691
Oh, it's irritating
and sweet and fruity!

07:05.360 --> 07:09.263
Oh, it's happening.

07:10.966 --> 07:12.400
Gesundheit.

07:12.401 --> 07:15.036
And now to check the distance.

07:15.037 --> 07:17.905
I don't see any red flecks.

07:17.906 --> 07:19.640
Unfortunately,

07:19.641 --> 07:23.678
Adam's fruity sneeze
hasn't left a mark.

07:23.679 --> 07:26.113
But, as always, there's a solution.

07:26.114 --> 07:27.682
We have a new plan.

07:27.683 --> 07:32.086
The new plan is, rather than
snort any more colored things,

07:32.087 --> 07:34.755
I'm going to go back to the snuff,

07:34.756 --> 07:36.657
but just before I sneeze,

07:36.658 --> 07:40.327
I'm gonna spray some uncut
food dye into my mouth.

07:40.328 --> 07:43.998
Yeah. That ought to show up.

07:43.999 --> 07:47.034
Adam takes a snort of snuff
and a swig of food coloring.

07:54.676 --> 07:58.913
God, it looks like a
murder scene here.

08:00.782 --> 08:01.849
Ah.

08:06.688 --> 08:08.122
Ugh!

08:08.123 --> 08:09.824
That time around,

08:09.825 --> 08:13.160
the sneeze went, quite literally,
with flying colors.

08:16.698 --> 08:19.266
Ah.

08:19.267 --> 08:23.070
We got one out here at 17 feet.

08:23.071 --> 08:25.406
That's not bad. No.

08:25.407 --> 08:28.275
You're halfway there -
over halfway.

08:28.276 --> 08:29.910
But I think that's about it.

08:29.911 --> 08:31.479
Think that's about it? Yeah.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.514
I think I need to then try again.

08:33.515 --> 08:38.085
We're making modern art,
as well as some science.

08:38.086 --> 08:41.121
Adam can't leave it at 17 feet.

08:41.123 --> 08:43.256
He's going for a second
distance attempt,

08:43.258 --> 08:46.060
but this time in a less-gory blue.

08:48.096 --> 08:49.563
Nice!

08:49.564 --> 08:51.165
You're getting a good spread...

08:51.166 --> 08:53.434
...But you need to
work on your distance.

08:54.669 --> 08:56.637
Okay, coach.

08:58.707 --> 09:01.709
Well, I'm clearly hitting
a hard line at 17 feet.

09:01.710 --> 09:04.111
You want to see if
you can do better?

09:04.112 --> 09:07.948
With Adam not even reaching
60% of the mythical distance,

09:07.949 --> 09:10.751
Jamie's next up for
the sneeze gallery,

09:10.752 --> 09:12.887
and he'll be sneezing in green.

09:17.826 --> 09:19.960
I think that's all I got.

09:19.961 --> 09:22.429
All right. Why don't
you go get cleaned up?

09:25.901 --> 09:29.236
Unfortunately,
Captain Greenbeard's sneeze

09:29.237 --> 09:31.038
also didn't go the distance,

09:31.039 --> 09:32.706
and you can't help thinking

09:32.707 --> 09:35.309
it has something to
do with his mustache.

09:35.310 --> 09:39.847
Nope. Looks like Jamie maxed
out right here at 13 feet.

09:39.848 --> 09:43.250
I got 13 feet of travel
out of my sneeze,

09:43.251 --> 09:45.119
and Adam got 17 feet.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.722
It's not 30, but it's
an awful long ways.

09:48.723 --> 09:52.526
So where does that leave
the mythical sneeze?

09:52.527 --> 09:55.429
The myth says that a sneeze
can travel up to 30 feet,

09:55.430 --> 09:58.199
and our sneezes didn't get
anywhere close to that.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.568
They got to 17 feet and stopped.

10:00.569 --> 10:03.003
It's still pretty far,
but I guess that means...

10:03.004 --> 10:04.505
It's busted. Yeah.

10:09.311 --> 10:10.415
Next up...

10:10.416 --> 10:12.245
I guess you can have a worse shot.

10:12.246 --> 10:13.605
...Kari, Grant, and Tory

10:13.606 --> 10:16.784
get a head start on
their decapitation myth.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.441
Next up, a myth that could
be a storm in a teacup.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.461
Our next myth is about tornadoes,

10:29.462 --> 10:31.130
and it comes directly
from the fan site.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.781
- What do we got?
- All right.

10:32.782 --> 10:34.772
So, the myth is that,
during a tornado,

10:34.773 --> 10:36.601
glass can get sucked
out of a window

10:36.602 --> 10:37.769
and travel so fast that,

10:37.770 --> 10:40.168
if you're in the wrong
place at the wrong time...

10:40.498 --> 10:41.665
fching!...

10:41.666 --> 10:43.934
you get your head cut clean off.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.302
Like a flying guillotine?

10:45.303 --> 10:47.271
Exactly. This is perfect.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.440
Fast-flying glass? Decapitation?

10:49.441 --> 10:51.942
This sounds right up our alley.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.578
Tornado alley, that is.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.184
Where are these frickin' crickets?

11:03.291 --> 11:05.094
When the tornado alert goes out,

11:05.095 --> 11:09.044
the safest place to take shelter
is inside a storm cellar.

11:09.045 --> 11:11.384
With winds over 200 miles an hour,

11:11.385 --> 11:14.482
everyday items can be
quickly transformed

11:14.483 --> 11:16.427
into lethal projectiles.

11:17.854 --> 11:20.543
But could glass whipped
up by these winds

11:20.544 --> 11:22.787
really turn into a guillotine?

11:26.897 --> 11:28.176
Okay. So, what's the plan?

11:28.485 --> 11:30.689
Well, I think, first,
we have to create a human-analog neck.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.560
All right. Well,
why don't we get a pig spine,

11:32.561 --> 11:33.715
we'll keep the muscle on it,

11:33.716 --> 11:35.270
and then we'll wrap
it with its own skin?

11:35.271 --> 11:36.627
It'll be just like a human neck.

11:36.628 --> 11:37.995
And then we can just
take pieces of glass

11:37.996 --> 11:39.263
and start throwing them at it.

11:39.264 --> 11:41.198
- I guess we got to start somewhere.
- Cool.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.734
Now, when you think of tornadoes,

11:43.735 --> 11:46.270
you probably think of houses
flying through the air,

11:46.271 --> 11:48.939
Kansas farm girls and
their dogs blowing away.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.975
Now, that would be like
a force-4 tornado...

11:50.976 --> 11:53.043
up to 200-mile-an-hour winds.

11:53.044 --> 11:54.296
But I think you'd
be surprised to know

11:54.297 --> 11:57.009
how slow tornado winds
can actually be.

11:57.010 --> 12:01.475
A force-zero tornado has winds
at like 40 miles an hour.

12:01.476 --> 12:02.932
Now, that could be comparable to

12:02.933 --> 12:04.277
what we could fling our glass at.

12:04.906 --> 12:06.785
Now, in order to test
this myth accurately,

12:06.786 --> 12:08.454
we need a very human-like neck,

12:08.455 --> 12:10.623
because we're not gonna be
able to use a real human.

12:10.624 --> 12:13.626
What I have here is an
mri of a human neck.

12:13.627 --> 12:17.208
As you can see, there's skin,
trachea, vertebrae,

12:17.209 --> 12:19.866
muscles surrounding all of it,
and more skin.

12:20.122 --> 12:21.931
Now, normally, if we were
gonna make a human neck,

12:21.932 --> 12:25.037
we would just take a pig spine
and cover it in ballistics gel.

12:25.038 --> 12:28.407
This time, we're gonna make
it way more human-like.

12:29.976 --> 12:31.510
She's gonna love this.

12:32.081 --> 12:35.447
Vimwers, and, eh,
pigs of a nervous disposition

12:35.448 --> 12:37.161
may want to look away now.

12:39.897 --> 12:41.120
Oh, seriously?

12:41.121 --> 12:42.855
This is perfect. Look at this.

12:42.856 --> 12:44.623
It's an entire pig's vertebrae,

12:44.624 --> 12:46.525
with the skin and
muscles still intact.

12:46.526 --> 12:48.460
I mean, its practically
a neck already.

12:49.007 --> 12:52.194
True enough, but it does
need a little surgery.

12:52.966 --> 12:55.100
Tory first removes the ribs...

12:55.539 --> 12:57.505
You're gonna clean the saw
when you're done, right?

12:58.897 --> 13:00.800
...Then the lumbar vertebrae.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.459
Yeah, that's better.

13:03.555 --> 13:05.770
He next trims away the fat.

13:05.771 --> 13:07.090
That's the juice.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.879
- Here, Kari.
- Aah!

13:08.880 --> 13:10.173
Saved that piece for you.

13:10.174 --> 13:11.974
But he does keep the length.

13:11.975 --> 13:15.277
After all, a longer neck
makes for a bigger target.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.382
Once Kari's all sown up

13:19.383 --> 13:22.286
and an 8-pound human-like
head is crowned,

13:22.592 --> 13:24.322
Neckman is good to go.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.757
So, what's the plan?

13:27.712 --> 13:29.091
So, our plan is pretty simple.

13:29.092 --> 13:32.495
We're gonna take turns flinging
panes of glass at Neckman.

13:32.496 --> 13:34.530
And this is the glass.

13:34.531 --> 13:37.933
It measures 12 inches by 12
inches by 1/8-inch thick.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.135
But most importantly,

13:39.136 --> 13:41.270
it conforms to the
residential building code

13:41.271 --> 13:43.672
of houses that are
actually in tornado alley.

13:43.673 --> 13:45.841
Given how sharp this edge is,

13:45.842 --> 13:47.777
I think there's a
very real possibility

13:47.778 --> 13:50.878
that we could sever a
neck at throwing speed.

13:51.548 --> 13:52.948
Aah!

13:52.949 --> 13:55.226
Provided, of course,
that they hit it...

13:55.838 --> 13:57.612
Starting with Kari.

13:58.823 --> 13:59.908
Here we go.

14:01.658 --> 14:04.460
- That was not anywhere close to the neck!
- Ho!

14:04.461 --> 14:06.447
Holy crap!

14:11.635 --> 14:16.539
With Kari's backhand misfiring,
she switches stance...

14:16.540 --> 14:19.141
...But gets the same result.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.655
How much glass do we have?

14:20.656 --> 14:22.365
Are we gonna need to
order some more glass?

14:22.752 --> 14:25.214
The problem here is
not just accuracy.

14:25.215 --> 14:27.049
It's also speed.

14:27.050 --> 14:31.120
Maxing out at a disappointing
30 miles an hour

14:31.121 --> 14:34.590
means Kari's not even
reaching a force-zero tornado.

14:36.293 --> 14:40.396
Next to step up to the
plate glass, it's Grant.

14:40.397 --> 14:42.418
All right, everybody... take cover!

14:42.524 --> 14:43.531
Grant's throwing!

14:44.931 --> 14:45.896
Aah!

14:47.003 --> 14:48.571
I guess you can have a worse shot.

14:48.572 --> 14:49.672
Ooh-hoo!

14:52.642 --> 14:55.144
You guys okay? Everybody okay?

14:55.145 --> 14:57.413
Although the accuracy was abysmal,

14:57.414 --> 15:01.817
the speed, at 50 miles
an hour, was solid.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.187
Now if he can just get focused.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.794
Whoa! Nice shot.

15:11.795 --> 15:13.062
Yeah, nice shot.

15:13.063 --> 15:15.498
Still, not enough
to cut the head off.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.868
It may indeed have been a
giant pain in the neck,

15:18.869 --> 15:22.838
but a decapitation at 50
miles an hour it wasn't.

15:22.973 --> 15:27.877
So last up to put his
neck on the line is Tory.

15:27.878 --> 15:29.545
Now, I like Kari and
Grant's technique.

15:29.546 --> 15:33.149
However, my approach -
I'm gonna throw out accuracy...

15:33.150 --> 15:35.384
Pbht! Pssh!

15:35.385 --> 15:37.386
...And I'm gonna focus on speed.

15:37.387 --> 15:40.156
I'm gonna throw this piece of
glass as fast as I can throw it.

15:40.157 --> 15:41.323
And if it hits the neck,
it hits the neck.

15:41.324 --> 15:44.126
Hopefully, if I get
it going fast enough

15:44.127 --> 15:46.662
and I do hit that neck,
we'll see a decapitation.

15:46.663 --> 15:49.165
Foregoing accuracy for speed

15:49.166 --> 15:51.200
may seem foolhardy,

15:51.201 --> 15:52.586
but on take one...

15:52.914 --> 15:53.863
Here we go.

15:57.174 --> 15:58.440
- Ohh!
- Beautiful shot.

15:58.441 --> 15:59.808
- Nice!
- Good shot.

15:59.809 --> 16:01.614
- That was a direct shot.
- That was great.

16:01.913 --> 16:04.016
Tory nails the perfect shot,

16:04.017 --> 16:08.482
but the high-speed reveals
a very imperfect result.

16:10.086 --> 16:12.195
Look at that.
You got 68 miles an hour.

16:12.624 --> 16:13.889
And it hit right on the neck.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.357
But look at it...

16:15.358 --> 16:16.921
the glass just completely shatters.

16:16.922 --> 16:19.795
I mean, it was going fast,
and we hit it,

16:19.796 --> 16:21.130
but it didn't cut the head off.

16:21.131 --> 16:24.733
The force-1 tornado
pane hits dead center,

16:24.734 --> 16:28.204
but it's the glass that
gives way and not the neck,

16:28.205 --> 16:32.538
meaning, with this glass,
decapitation is impossible.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.431
As you can see from all
the carnage around me,

16:35.432 --> 16:38.128
we threw a lot of glass
at this creepy dude here,

16:38.434 --> 16:41.390
but we did not achieve
a decapitation.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.319
Now, I think this is
for a few reasons.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.387
First of all, after
looking at the high-speed,

16:45.388 --> 16:46.722
doing a couple of calculations,

16:46.723 --> 16:48.424
it looks like we were
throwing the glass

16:48.425 --> 16:49.925
at the bottom of the tornado scale.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.227
Just not fast enough.

16:51.228 --> 16:53.729
Secondly, when the glass
actually was hitting the guy,

16:53.730 --> 16:55.598
it was shattering too easily.

16:55.599 --> 16:59.034
So, we're gonna need thicker,
stronger glass,

16:59.035 --> 17:01.370
and we're gonna need to
throw it a lot faster,

17:01.371 --> 17:03.939
which means we got
to build a machine.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.691
Coming up next...

17:05.887 --> 17:07.376
That's disgusting.

17:07.377 --> 17:09.278
...Adam and Jamie are on the nose

17:09.279 --> 17:11.413
with a snot-spreading saga.

17:18.247 --> 17:22.000
Stand back, because it's
time for some mucus mayhem.

17:22.896 --> 17:23.971
Nasal secretions.

17:23.972 --> 17:25.800
The myth that someone
who's got a cold

17:25.800 --> 17:29.075
is spreading their secretions
everywhere, far and wide,

17:29.192 --> 17:30.816
and that they're
impossible to avoid.

17:31.323 --> 17:33.143
Well, the first thing we
need to do is to figure out

17:33.144 --> 17:35.403
how to make nasal
secretions we can track.

17:35.659 --> 17:38.494
And we need a situation
we can track them in.

17:38.495 --> 17:41.664
Okay. Well, I guess I need
to go talk to an expert

17:41.665 --> 17:43.165
about nasal secretions.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.800
I guess you do.

17:46.469 --> 17:48.070
According to the myth,

17:48.071 --> 17:50.506
just by being near someone
with a runny nose,

17:50.507 --> 17:54.543
you'll end up contaminated
by their snotty secretions.

17:54.544 --> 17:57.313
But can a running nose
really scatter snot

17:57.314 --> 17:59.548
on more than just its owner?

17:59.549 --> 18:01.317
To test that,

18:01.318 --> 18:03.886
they'll need a group
of party people,

18:03.887 --> 18:07.056
a nose-running rig,
and a nasal-secretion substitute.

18:08.736 --> 18:11.026
But before they start
spreading the snot,

18:11.027 --> 18:15.456
Jamie needs to know just how
much a runny nose really runs.

18:17.901 --> 18:20.035
Come in. Hello, doctor.

18:20.036 --> 18:22.271
Hi. Nice to meet you. You too.

18:22.272 --> 18:26.408
Luckily, Dr. Andrea Yeung
is just the person to ask.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.911
So, what would you consider
a normal rate of flow

18:28.912 --> 18:30.045
when you have a cold?

18:30.046 --> 18:32.131
If you think about your sinuses,
just in general,

18:32.132 --> 18:35.517
in terms of the amount of fluid
that you could potentially hold,

18:35.518 --> 18:37.653
we would expect that
that volume would be

18:37.654 --> 18:39.622
somewhere on the
order of about 60cc,

18:39.623 --> 18:42.124
or 60 milliliters,
to come out in about an hour.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.526
And how exactly does that 60 mils

18:44.527 --> 18:47.029
transfer its viral payload?

18:47.030 --> 18:49.365
Secretions kind of get
passed to the hand.

18:49.366 --> 18:52.134
That hand then goes into your mouth,
into your nose,

18:52.135 --> 18:54.903
or into your conjunctiva or
sort of the lining of the eyes,

18:54.904 --> 18:57.640
and then again gets
brought into your system.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.644
It's exactly that spread that
the Mythbusters will test.

19:01.645 --> 19:05.314
And now Jamie knows
how a nose runs.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.849
Now that I have my flow rate,

19:06.850 --> 19:10.386
I can build a nasal-drip rig
to simulate a runny nose.

19:10.387 --> 19:13.322
It has to be compact,
it has to be very accurate,

19:13.323 --> 19:15.758
and I have to be
able to conceal it.

19:15.759 --> 19:18.694
And there we are.
It's doing it by itself.

19:18.695 --> 19:20.963
Just a syringe
and some tubing later,

19:20.964 --> 19:23.332
and Jamie has a dribbling drip rig.

19:23.333 --> 19:27.469
Now all he needs is a willing
volunteer to give it a dry run.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.272
You look totally like
you've got a cold

19:30.273 --> 19:32.074
just from your mannerisms.

19:32.075 --> 19:34.343
You know, like, "uh,
I don't feel good."

19:34.344 --> 19:37.212
It feels like I've got a cold.
It's just as annoying.

19:37.213 --> 19:39.348
Makes me feel like I want
to stand apart from you

19:39.349 --> 19:40.382
so I don't catch it.

19:40.383 --> 19:42.518
Well, you don't want
to catch the red dye.

19:42.519 --> 19:44.019
That's what you don't want.

19:46.056 --> 19:47.523
That's funny.

19:47.524 --> 19:49.751
We're about to investigate
how far and wide

19:49.752 --> 19:52.761
my nasal secretions may
travel if I had a cold.

19:52.762 --> 19:54.330
Now, I don't have a cold.

19:54.331 --> 19:55.596
We're going to achieve my cold

19:55.597 --> 19:58.600
by Jamie giving me
a mechanical cold,

19:58.601 --> 20:01.603
which is a drip rig that
will be strapped to my face

20:01.604 --> 20:04.006
and slowly dripping
a fluorescing fluid.

20:04.491 --> 20:08.514
Jamie has carefully selected
a nontoxic fluorescent dye

20:08.671 --> 20:10.263
that's invisible to the naked eye

20:10.381 --> 20:13.182
but will glow orange
under a black light.

20:13.183 --> 20:15.573
To ensure there is no
cross-contamination,

20:15.732 --> 20:17.447
he first checks the table.

20:18.177 --> 20:19.907
Okay. The space is clean,

20:20.023 --> 20:22.913
and I don't see any marks on you.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.692
I think we're good to go.

20:24.851 --> 20:27.096
Then Jamie starts the nasal drip

20:27.097 --> 20:29.031
and leaves Adam to some modeling.

20:29.032 --> 20:30.332
I'm ready to start constructing.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.801
I'll start the timer... now.

20:32.802 --> 20:34.436
Good luck. Thanks.

20:35.505 --> 20:37.506
Remember, they're testing to see

20:37.507 --> 20:41.543
if Adam's pseudo-snot
will spread far and wide.

20:41.544 --> 20:44.980
And after an hour of building,
gluing, and wiping,

20:44.981 --> 20:48.704
60 milliliters of fluid has
dripped through the nose rig.

20:50.327 --> 20:51.887
Okay, so, time's up.

20:52.191 --> 20:55.057
We got to see how far your
nasal secretions went.

20:55.058 --> 20:57.165
Excellent! All right, let's do it.

20:57.227 --> 20:59.027
Dun dun dun!

21:02.265 --> 21:04.566
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.503
That is... wait. Look at my face.

21:09.205 --> 21:11.240
That's disgusting!

21:11.241 --> 21:13.108
Am I, like, just covered with it?

21:13.109 --> 21:14.176
You are.

21:14.177 --> 21:18.238
The table, the plane, and Adam
are lit up like a dance party,

21:18.354 --> 21:23.193
with a trail of snot or neon dye
on everything Adam has touched.

21:23.359 --> 21:25.387
Well, we set out to
construct an experiment

21:25.388 --> 21:27.356
whereby we could track
my nasal secretions,

21:27.357 --> 21:29.816
and I have to say,
I think we've done stunningly.

21:29.931 --> 21:33.249
They seem to have gotten
absolutely everywhere.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.964
Everything on this table has a
little touch of orange on it.

21:37.066 --> 21:39.626
That's the name of my cover band...

21:40.056 --> 21:41.498
touch of orange.

21:41.638 --> 21:44.506
Obviously, Adam's
pseudo-snot got everywhere,

21:44.507 --> 21:48.122
which is amazing, given that it was
coming out a tiny droplet at a time.

21:48.513 --> 21:49.922
But what does this mean

21:49.999 --> 21:53.048
as far as transmitting
a cold virus or a flu?

21:53.049 --> 21:56.585
Well, to find that out,
we've got to introduce people,

21:56.586 --> 21:58.482
and so that's what
we're gonna do next.

21:59.255 --> 22:02.459
Next, the Mythbusters will
track the spread of snot

22:02.605 --> 22:05.127
by partying in the name of science.

22:09.321 --> 22:11.923
Don't try anything you
see on this show at home.

22:11.924 --> 22:13.591
We're what you call experts.

22:17.647 --> 22:20.093
In a perfect storm of circumstance,

22:20.206 --> 22:23.249
could a tornado turn
glass into a guillotine?

22:24.008 --> 22:25.198
Well, not so far.

22:26.049 --> 22:28.360
Okay. So we're struggling
with decapitation, big-time.

22:28.519 --> 22:31.030
Yeah. I mean, throwing a
piece of glass accurately,

22:31.135 --> 22:32.890
even at low speeds,
is very difficult,

22:33.165 --> 22:35.460
and the pieces of
glass keep shattering.

22:37.550 --> 22:40.151
And it's only gonna get harder
as we ramp up the speed...

22:40.152 --> 22:41.786
something we actually have to do.

22:41.787 --> 22:43.221
All right. Well, what if try this?

22:43.222 --> 22:45.820
What if take our head and neck,
put it on the runway,

22:45.978 --> 22:49.380
and then we attach a sheet of
glass to a vehicle horizontally,

22:49.381 --> 22:50.646
drive at the neck,

22:50.811 --> 22:53.160
and then release the glass
before it hits the neck.

22:53.379 --> 22:56.802
Yes! And if we drive as fast as we can,
like 80 miles per hour,

22:56.803 --> 23:00.505
and get a bigger sheet of glass,
that extra mass plus that speed

23:00.506 --> 23:03.976
should equal an impact at
over 300 miles an hour.

23:04.391 --> 23:05.693
I love it! Let's do it!

23:06.490 --> 23:08.000
So, at the Alameda runway,

23:08.001 --> 23:10.213
the team's foregoing the throwing

23:10.329 --> 23:12.908
to tackle this myth head-on.

23:13.397 --> 23:16.245
You guys ready to see if
we can make a tornado?

23:16.700 --> 23:17.827
Let's do it.

23:18.135 --> 23:21.497
But how will a car going
at 80 miles per hour

23:21.731 --> 23:24.539
represent a
300-mile-an-hour tornado?

23:25.172 --> 23:27.347
Now, the name of this
game is kinetic energy.

23:27.503 --> 23:30.132
We can't possibly drive
at extreme tornado speed,

23:30.211 --> 23:33.268
but what we can do is
simulate the kinetic energy

23:33.269 --> 23:36.018
of a smaller piece of glass
flying at those speeds...

23:36.019 --> 23:39.722
Using this giant piece of glass.

23:39.723 --> 23:41.290
This has a lot more mass.

23:41.291 --> 23:44.493
Now, this piece, traveling
at only 80 miles per hour,

23:44.494 --> 23:46.195
has the same kinetic energy

23:46.196 --> 23:50.166
as our smaller piece traveling
at over 300 miles per hour.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.134
I call that extreme tornado speed.

23:52.759 --> 23:54.036
Grant's right,

23:54.037 --> 23:56.839
and it's over to
Kari to explain why.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.976
Tory's 450 gram pane of glass
flung at 70 miles an hour

24:00.977 --> 24:04.080
had a kinetic energy
of around 220 joules.

24:04.081 --> 24:06.315
If that glass had been traveling

24:06.316 --> 24:09.952
at an f5 tornado speed
of 300 miles an hour,

24:09.953 --> 24:12.922
it would have had the
energy of over 4,000 joules.

24:12.923 --> 24:15.524
Now, because the truck can
only drive 80 miles an hour,

24:15.525 --> 24:17.593
to get a 4,000-joule hit,

24:17.594 --> 24:19.662
you need a heavier piece of glass.

24:19.663 --> 24:21.597
So, how heavy? 6 1/2 kilograms.

24:21.598 --> 24:24.800
But will that cause a decapitation?

24:24.801 --> 24:28.537
That's one big piece of
tornado alley code glass,

24:28.538 --> 24:29.972
and to put it to work,

24:29.973 --> 24:33.609
Tory's built a rig that looks
just as lethal as it is.

24:33.610 --> 24:36.512
So, this is the super
tornado decapitation rig.

24:36.513 --> 24:37.747
So I built this steel structure...

24:39.649 --> 24:41.117
...That we've
attached to the truck.

24:42.352 --> 24:44.487
On the end of it
is a piece of glass

24:44.488 --> 24:47.523
being held oh, so gently
by these foam blocks.

24:47.617 --> 24:49.959
When we hit the neck,
the styrofoam will break,

24:49.960 --> 24:52.395
and the glass will act as if
it's flying through the air.

24:54.364 --> 24:56.363
Now what I need to do is
drive towards our Neckman

24:56.364 --> 24:58.701
as fast as I can and hit that neck

24:58.702 --> 25:00.136
so that when we hit that neck,

25:00.137 --> 25:02.605
this piece of glass will
break away from the truck,

25:02.606 --> 25:05.307
hopefully decapitating our
man and confirming this myth.

25:05.308 --> 25:08.844
With Neckman's neck on the line...

25:08.845 --> 25:11.480
Holy mackerel!
Look at that tornado!

25:13.028 --> 25:15.215
...It's all systems go.

25:15.452 --> 25:17.686
Okay, Tory Belleci.

25:17.687 --> 25:19.121
Are you ready?

25:19.122 --> 25:22.458
I am in position and ready to go.

25:22.459 --> 25:23.826
- You ready?
- Ready.

25:24.754 --> 25:25.594
Okay.

25:25.595 --> 25:29.698
This is Neckman versus
the large piece of glass

25:29.699 --> 25:32.334
in 3, 2, 1.

25:32.807 --> 25:34.721
Not wanting the
glass to slip loose,

25:34.722 --> 25:38.452
Tory gently accelerates
up to 80 miles an hour.

25:39.943 --> 25:42.011
Here comes... Tory:
Here comes the tornado!

25:42.012 --> 25:44.547
That's what I was gonna say!

25:44.548 --> 25:48.217
Now is the time I feel
compelled to yell "duck!"

25:50.139 --> 25:52.312
Ohh! Whoa-ho-ho!

25:52.609 --> 25:56.192
Wow. That was almost no
hesitation whatsoever.

25:56.193 --> 25:59.161
That was gruesome.
I mean, there was no resistance.

25:59.162 --> 26:00.563
The head just came off.

26:00.564 --> 26:03.566
All right. Let's check it out.

26:04.968 --> 26:06.569
That was incredible.

26:06.570 --> 26:09.338
All I heard was the "thkk," 
and I looked back,

26:09.339 --> 26:10.840
and I saw his head on the ground.

26:10.841 --> 26:12.374
But, hey, the rig worked! Yeah.

26:12.375 --> 26:14.143
It's mission accomplished...

26:14.144 --> 26:17.813
a nasty decapitation
on the very first run

26:17.814 --> 26:19.882
as the glass cuts clean through.

26:19.883 --> 26:21.784
But in a "mythbusters" first,

26:21.785 --> 26:24.854
the next step is to
ramp the results down.

26:24.855 --> 26:27.990
Now, I can't say that
I'm surprised by this

26:27.991 --> 26:30.559
because that amount of energy
contained in that glass

26:30.560 --> 26:31.660
traveling that fast...

26:32.996 --> 26:35.264
...Would be like a super tornado...

26:35.265 --> 26:36.932
an incredible tornado,

26:36.933 --> 26:41.604
a 300-mile-per-hour-plus
wind speed tornado.

26:41.605 --> 26:43.539
And the thing is,

26:43.540 --> 26:46.108
you don't have those kinds
of tornados every day.

26:46.109 --> 26:47.877
So what we're gonna do next is

26:47.878 --> 26:51.189
actually go at a slower speed,
try the same experiment,

26:51.377 --> 26:54.817
this time simulating a
more average tornado

26:54.818 --> 26:56.452
and see what we get.

26:56.453 --> 26:59.955
So they're going to re-run
this test at 40 miles an hour.

26:59.956 --> 27:02.858
And thanks to the marvel of math,

27:02.859 --> 27:05.628
we know that the heavy
glass going at 40

27:05.629 --> 27:08.764
has the same energy as
its smaller counterpart

27:08.765 --> 27:10.933
traveling at 150 miles an hour...

27:10.934 --> 27:14.069
a high force-2 tornado.

27:14.070 --> 27:16.226
But will that be high enough?

27:16.439 --> 27:20.442
To find out, Neckman's cousin,
collar boy,

27:20.443 --> 27:22.645
gets his moment in the sun.

27:22.646 --> 27:26.148
Okay. This is Neckman versus
the big piece of glass

27:26.149 --> 27:27.449
at 40 miles per hour.

27:27.450 --> 27:28.584
Take it away.

27:28.585 --> 27:30.553
Tornado!

27:30.554 --> 27:32.554
Tornado!

27:33.916 --> 27:35.491
Yep, look out collar boy.

27:35.492 --> 27:38.160
There's a storm a-comin'.

27:39.996 --> 27:43.022
Whoa! What was that?

27:43.726 --> 27:46.339
Wow! We got a trail of destruction.

27:47.431 --> 27:49.889
We got decapitation,
and the glass broke away.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.640
At first glance,

27:51.641 --> 27:53.809
it seems like we've
reached myth confirmed

27:53.810 --> 27:56.050
as head and neck part company.

27:57.761 --> 28:00.734
But the high-speed tells
a different story.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.487
It seems that the
hair-trigger on the glass

28:05.488 --> 28:07.222
didn't work cleanly,

28:07.223 --> 28:10.459
and that means that some
of the car's own momentum

28:10.460 --> 28:12.394
may have affected the outcome.

28:12.395 --> 28:17.199
For this team of perfectionists,
it's just not good enough.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.734
We're really bothered by the fact

28:18.735 --> 28:20.569
that the glass is not
totally dislodging.

28:20.570 --> 28:24.106
And I'm thinking that maybe
we're getting some extra mass,

28:24.107 --> 28:26.408
some extra force,
some extra momentum

28:26.409 --> 28:29.511
from the truck being
attached to that glass.

28:29.512 --> 28:32.348
So the next obvious
mythbustery step...

28:32.349 --> 28:34.483
well, we're gonna go build
a robot in the shop.

28:34.484 --> 28:37.353
Yep. They're following that old
"mythbusters" mantra...

28:37.354 --> 28:39.722
if in doubt, build a robot.

28:42.425 --> 28:44.393
Tornado!

28:54.417 --> 28:56.885
If someone nearby has a runny nose,

28:56.886 --> 29:00.155
can they spread their snot
to you just by being close?

29:02.292 --> 29:05.661
To find out, the Mythbusters
are throwing a party.

29:06.606 --> 29:08.158
Soon, I will have six guests,

29:08.237 --> 29:10.385
or, as I like to call them,
test subjects,

29:10.619 --> 29:13.735
having a party with me
under test conditions.

29:13.736 --> 29:15.070
These conditions are

29:15.071 --> 29:17.606
three of my guests are gonna
behave as germaphobes,

29:17.607 --> 29:20.442
three of my guests have
no idea what's happening.

29:20.443 --> 29:23.308
I will be spreading my nasal
secretions far and wide

29:23.385 --> 29:26.251
while performing a series of
normal party-like tasks...

29:26.368 --> 29:29.164
cake, toasts, games, what have you.

29:29.198 --> 29:30.431
At the end of all of this,

29:30.548 --> 29:31.694
we're gonna flick out the lights,

29:31.811 --> 29:33.568
turn on the ultraviolet
lights, and see

29:33.686 --> 29:36.847
how far I've been able
to spread my secretions.

29:36.848 --> 29:39.306
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to get into makeup.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.816
So as not to reveal
what's being tested

29:42.934 --> 29:44.277
to our guest Guinea pigs,

29:44.438 --> 29:47.772
special-effects artist Danny
gives Adam a nose job.

29:47.939 --> 29:50.174
Oh, it's just a little bit
restrictive but not bad.

29:50.175 --> 29:52.097
Hell of a lot better
than the band-aid.

29:52.351 --> 29:53.366
With Adam in the chair,

29:53.523 --> 29:56.679
Jamie prepares our three
germaphobe guests.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.749
- Welcome to the party.
- Thank you.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.451
So this is how this is gonna work.

30:00.452 --> 30:01.986
Adam has a cold,

30:01.987 --> 30:05.389
and your job is not
to get that cold.

30:05.390 --> 30:06.690
You still have to stay here.

30:06.691 --> 30:07.353
You can't just leave,

30:07.472 --> 30:09.226
but you don't want
to catch his cold.

30:09.227 --> 30:11.595
- All right. Sounds good.
- Gross.

30:12.571 --> 30:16.266
Kari, Grant, and Tory will
try their germaphobe best

30:16.346 --> 30:18.826
not to pick up Adam's
nasal secretions.

30:18.827 --> 30:22.106
However, the control group,
the remaining 3 guests,

30:22.107 --> 30:25.709
will have no idea Adam
is even secreting.

30:25.710 --> 30:26.911
Hello. Pearl.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.212
Pearl, nice to meet you.

30:28.213 --> 30:32.049
Adam just wiped his nose,
and now he's shaking hands.

30:32.050 --> 30:33.784
That stuff's getting everywhere.

30:33.785 --> 30:36.253
While Jamie tracks
the contamination,

30:36.254 --> 30:40.046
Adam's rig will drip at exactly
the rate a human nose runs...

30:40.047 --> 30:42.070
60 milliliters an hour.

30:42.226 --> 30:43.898
Oh, we're gonna have a
fun little party here.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.441
- Are you guys ready?
- Oh, yeah!

30:45.560 --> 30:47.641
I'm sorry.
I've...... got a little...

30:47.938 --> 30:50.067
little bit of a stuffy nose.

30:50.068 --> 30:52.837
But this should all be very cool.

30:54.155 --> 30:56.152
Remember, the goal is to find out

30:56.271 --> 30:59.782
if Adam will pass on his
pseudo-secretions to his guests

31:00.018 --> 31:02.295
through the normal
activity of a party.

31:02.296 --> 31:03.430
Thank you very much. Thank you.

31:03.431 --> 31:04.898
Thanks for participating

31:04.899 --> 31:06.900
in my little science
experiment here.

31:06.901 --> 31:08.035
You're a true sport.

31:08.036 --> 31:10.404
So, we're getting some
good contact here.

31:10.405 --> 31:13.073
We've got him handling
the plates, the forks.

31:13.074 --> 31:14.708
Those are being passed over.

31:14.709 --> 31:16.143
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

31:16.144 --> 31:18.596
With any luck, each one
of those has been marked.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.732
Although our trio of germaphobes

31:20.847 --> 31:23.545
keep an eye on exactly
what Adam's touching...

31:24.770 --> 31:29.409
The unprepared guests have no
idea what's being passed around.

31:30.058 --> 31:32.526
Okay. It looks like,
as he's pouring,

31:32.527 --> 31:34.293
he's touching them on the shoulder,

31:34.372 --> 31:36.140
so each one of those is a mark.

31:37.078 --> 31:39.466
There ain't no party like a
"mythbusters" party.

31:39.467 --> 31:40.967
Tory! That's a good roll.

31:40.968 --> 31:44.371
And although the good times,
and the dice, roll...

31:44.372 --> 31:45.939
Ah, I guess we lost.

31:45.940 --> 31:49.042
...Eventually,
the fun must come to an end.

31:49.043 --> 31:50.610
Thanks again, Tory.

31:52.447 --> 31:54.386
Good celebrating with you.

31:54.572 --> 31:56.183
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.

31:57.206 --> 31:57.784
But, of course,

31:57.785 --> 32:00.387
our test subjects are
still in the dark,

32:00.388 --> 32:04.391
and the moment has come
for the big snotty reveal.

32:04.392 --> 32:05.926
What was going on

32:05.927 --> 32:07.994
was that I had a
mechanical runny nose.

32:07.995 --> 32:10.931
I had a little tube running
down the side of my nose,

32:10.932 --> 32:13.300
dripping a fluorescing fluid.

32:13.301 --> 32:16.570
The goal was to see how far my
nasal secretions might travel

32:16.571 --> 32:19.139
if I had a cold and who
might get those on them.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.774
To give you an idea

32:20.775 --> 32:23.076
about how much it
spread on me alone,

32:23.077 --> 32:25.512
normally, my skin would not
fluoresce under black light.

32:25.513 --> 32:26.592
Are you ready?

32:29.617 --> 32:31.751
Adam may look like a
radioactive clown,

32:31.752 --> 32:35.355
but has he spread his
radioactive red snot?

32:35.356 --> 32:37.057
Aah.

32:37.058 --> 32:41.161
First off, the unknowing
guest Guinea pigs.

32:41.162 --> 32:42.562
Lea, let's see those hands.

32:42.563 --> 32:44.030
Hold them up into the light.

32:44.031 --> 32:46.633
Oh, yeah.

32:46.634 --> 32:50.103
They all bear the telltale
signs of contamination.

32:50.104 --> 32:52.716
But what about our germaphobe trio?

32:53.316 --> 32:55.108
Despite their best efforts,

32:55.109 --> 32:57.911
Grant and Tory couldn't
escape the neon.

32:57.912 --> 32:59.212
Grant, let's see those hands.

32:59.213 --> 33:00.714
I couldn't avoid shaking your hand.

33:00.715 --> 33:01.715
Tory?

33:01.716 --> 33:04.551
Oh, Tory. You got...

33:04.552 --> 33:06.820
you got it on your face here.
Did we sneak off somewhere?

33:06.821 --> 33:10.305
Tory has even ended up
with snot on his face.

33:11.092 --> 33:13.772
Kari, however,
is a different story.

33:14.262 --> 33:16.822
I have to confess,
I'm actually a germaphobe, so

33:17.431 --> 33:19.866
this was not too hard for me.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.469
And I am not surprised
I did this well.

33:22.470 --> 33:24.104
Nice! Wow. Incredible.

33:24.105 --> 33:26.139
So, how many of us got colds?

33:26.140 --> 33:28.475
I'd say five out of the six of you

33:28.476 --> 33:31.278
have been legitimately exposed

33:31.279 --> 33:33.847
with only a 30-minute dinner party.

33:35.049 --> 33:36.750
And one typhoid Mary.

33:36.751 --> 33:39.719
So, even though I knew
Adam had a fake cold,

33:39.720 --> 33:42.722
I was still kind of
grossed out by the idea,

33:42.723 --> 33:45.636
so I kind of employed all
of my usual techniques

33:45.713 --> 33:46.693
not to get sick.

33:46.694 --> 33:50.897
I didn't touch anything or
anywhere that he touched.

33:50.898 --> 33:54.634
When he handed me something,
I wiped it off with my napkin.

33:54.635 --> 33:57.971
Right at the very end of dinner,
as we were saying our goodbyes,

33:57.972 --> 34:00.874
Adam stuck out his hand,
and I had to shake it.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.075
And you know what?

34:02.076 --> 34:04.077
If someone sticks out their hand,

34:04.078 --> 34:05.612
you can't avoid shaking it.

34:05.613 --> 34:08.281
That is where he got me.

34:08.282 --> 34:10.617
With five out of
six guests infected

34:10.618 --> 34:13.887
and a dinner table that's
more neon than not,

34:13.888 --> 34:16.081
where does this leave the myth?

34:16.357 --> 34:17.757
Look around me.

34:17.757 --> 34:21.216
Look at how far and wide
my secretions have spread

34:21.293 --> 34:22.795
to everywhere on this table.

34:22.797 --> 34:26.040
Next time you think you've
got an innocuous runny nose,

34:26.356 --> 34:27.967
think again.

34:27.969 --> 34:29.202
Think again, indeed.

34:29.203 --> 34:32.739
But that isn't the end of
this snot-spreading saga.

34:36.811 --> 34:37.978
If you want to see more,

34:37.978 --> 34:41.147
log on to discovery.
Com/mythbusters.

34:41.148 --> 34:42.949
Check it out.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.120
When a tornado hits,

34:47.121 --> 34:51.391
chances are it's gonna do a lot
more than ruffle your nerves.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.326
Now, to simulate a tornado,

34:53.327 --> 34:56.496
we first started by throwing
panes of glass by hand

34:56.496 --> 34:59.266
with little success
of decapitation.

35:00.301 --> 35:03.336
Then we moved on to a
giant piece of glass

35:03.337 --> 35:05.372
strapped to the side of a car

35:05.373 --> 35:07.707
and drove at high
speeds into a neck,

35:07.708 --> 35:09.142
and we got a decapitation,

35:09.143 --> 35:11.211
but we think the
momentum of the car

35:11.212 --> 35:12.812
added too much to
the kinetic energy,

35:12.813 --> 35:14.514
really loading the
deck on this myth.

35:14.515 --> 35:17.117
So now we want some
realistic circumstances.

35:17.118 --> 35:18.818
We want a small piece of glass

35:18.819 --> 35:20.787
flying at moderate tornado speeds

35:20.788 --> 35:23.604
to see if even that will
get us a decapitation.

35:24.653 --> 35:27.027
So, how exactly are
we going to accelerate

35:27.028 --> 35:28.728
a piece of glass very quickly?

35:28.729 --> 35:31.731
Well, the first step is to take
a bunch of these caster wheels

35:31.732 --> 35:33.434
and flip them upside
down like this...

35:35.112 --> 35:39.140
So that we have a low-friction
surface to slide our glass on.

35:39.302 --> 35:43.125
It's like a little conveyor belt
of potentially deadly glass.

35:43.518 --> 35:48.181
At the end of this line,
these two tires go on an axle,

35:48.182 --> 35:50.383
which is connected
to an electric motor.

35:50.384 --> 35:52.052
Yeah, that ought to do it.

35:52.642 --> 35:54.688
That's gonna spin at
a really high speed.

35:54.689 --> 35:58.425
Now, a second set of wheels
is going to go on top,

35:58.426 --> 36:00.126
and that's gonna form a sandwich.

36:00.127 --> 36:01.394
You're gonna love this.

36:02.875 --> 36:05.165
So that, when the sheet
of glass comes in,

36:05.166 --> 36:06.833
the wheels are gonna catch it,

36:06.834 --> 36:09.602
and... shwo! -
Send it out at tornado speed.

36:09.603 --> 36:11.121
Now, we're hoping that this machine

36:11.238 --> 36:14.274
is going to actually help us
with our speed and accuracy,

36:14.275 --> 36:17.243
but like most of Grant's truly
intimidating-looking rigs,

36:17.244 --> 36:19.962
we don't know what it's gonna
do until we do a few tests.

36:20.081 --> 36:21.314
So we're gonna throw some glass in,

36:21.315 --> 36:22.916
see exactly how fast it's going,

36:22.917 --> 36:24.847
and make sure it's all
going in the right place.

36:25.706 --> 36:28.221
And that glass is going
to be twice as thick

36:28.222 --> 36:31.925
and twice as heavy as the
glass the guys first threw.

36:33.561 --> 36:34.627
Go, go, go!

36:36.230 --> 36:38.698
Yeah! Ha ha!

36:38.699 --> 36:40.266
Hoo.

36:40.267 --> 36:42.074
All right, let's see
how fast that one went.

36:42.114 --> 36:42.664
It was scary!

36:42.783 --> 36:44.919
I know a test goes well
when I'm terrified.

36:47.208 --> 36:48.908
The machine worked like a charm,

36:48.909 --> 36:52.779
flinging the window wannabe
at 70 miles per hour.

36:54.281 --> 36:58.017
And that means it's
Neckman's curtain call.

36:58.018 --> 36:59.432
Chin up, buddy.

36:59.989 --> 37:00.948
It's very important

37:01.067 --> 37:02.728
that you keep your
chin up for this one.

37:15.136 --> 37:16.991
After several tests with our
"pane in the neck" rig,

37:17.107 --> 37:18.076
we think we have it dialed in.

37:18.497 --> 37:21.132
We have 70 miles an hour and a
perfectly flat flight pattern,

37:21.133 --> 37:22.734
so now we're gonna
bring in the neck

37:22.735 --> 37:24.302
and see if we have a decapitation.

37:24.303 --> 37:26.704
All right, this is
tornado decapitation,

37:26.705 --> 37:28.506
1/4-inch sheet of glass.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.875
Neckman is in position.

37:30.876 --> 37:34.112
Motor is full power.
We are going for tornado speed.

37:34.113 --> 37:36.748
I'm ready for the "necks" test.

37:38.680 --> 37:42.629
Okay. Tornado speed in 3, 2, 1!

37:43.655 --> 37:45.089
Go, go, go!

37:47.860 --> 37:48.993
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:48.994 --> 37:50.661
A direct hit,

37:50.662 --> 37:52.997
and Neckman's head's gone awol.

37:52.998 --> 37:54.565
But it's not all good news.

37:54.566 --> 37:56.313
I know what you're thinking...

37:56.429 --> 37:59.937
"it worked! You decapitated
him with a piece of glass!"

37:59.938 --> 38:01.806
Actually we looked
at the high-speed

38:01.807 --> 38:03.174
and what really happened was

38:03.175 --> 38:05.526
the glass hit him right
here in the mouth,

38:05.607 --> 38:08.128
and it just ripped his
head off the neck.

38:08.222 --> 38:09.332
There was no cutting through skin,

38:09.333 --> 38:12.124
no cutting through muscle,
no cutting through bone.

38:12.321 --> 38:13.576
This was not a decapitation.

38:13.772 --> 38:16.506
So we need to get a new head,
reset, and try it again.

38:17.501 --> 38:19.589
A new head? How about this one?

38:19.590 --> 38:22.309
Aah. Aah. Aah.

38:22.310 --> 38:24.324
Neckman in position.
You guys ready?

38:24.325 --> 38:25.924
- Ready.
- All right, fire it up.

38:27.291 --> 38:28.325
Go, go, go!

38:32.363 --> 38:36.232
This time, Neckman's
painfully down for the count.

38:36.233 --> 38:38.715
But a decapitation this ain't.

38:39.770 --> 38:42.372
So far, the robot is 0 for 2...

38:42.373 --> 38:45.508
a record that then takes
a turn for the worse

38:45.509 --> 38:47.344
with near misses...

38:47.345 --> 38:49.012
That was so fast,
I have no idea what just happened.

38:49.013 --> 38:50.990
...And not so near misses.

38:50.991 --> 38:51.703
Man.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.584
I wonder if it's possible to
decapitate a guy with glass.

38:54.585 --> 38:55.322
I don't know.

38:55.753 --> 38:58.188
With the final Neckman
in the firing line,

38:58.189 --> 39:00.423
it really is now or never.

39:01.492 --> 39:03.026
You ready to get your head cut off?

39:05.129 --> 39:06.129
- You ready?
- Ready.

39:06.130 --> 39:07.530
All right, fire it up.

39:07.531 --> 39:10.233
Okay. Here we go. 3, 2, 1.

39:10.234 --> 39:12.402
Go, go, go!

39:13.838 --> 39:15.681
I think we've got decapitation!

39:15.908 --> 39:18.141
That is unquestionable.

39:21.633 --> 39:23.233
We have a piece of glass

39:23.234 --> 39:26.970
flying at a low tornado speed
in the air, on its own merit,

39:26.971 --> 39:31.575
and decapitates our head
completely off and cleanly.

39:31.576 --> 39:34.444
That shows us right there confirmed,
confirmed, confirmed.

39:40.194 --> 39:42.617
Yep. This all goes
to show the danger

39:42.618 --> 39:44.486
of flying debris during a tornado.

39:44.487 --> 39:48.272
For safety, taking
shelter in a storm cellar

39:48.660 --> 39:51.126
really is a no-brainer.

39:57.536 --> 39:59.061
Adam and Jamie have proved

39:59.195 --> 40:02.129
a runny nose will
eventually catch up to you.

40:02.285 --> 40:03.318
Where does that leave us?

40:03.476 --> 40:04.685
Well, we wondered,

40:04.996 --> 40:07.379
suppose the person who
is spreading the germs

40:07.434 --> 40:09.231
is acting more responsibly?

40:09.505 --> 40:12.276
Suppose they're trying to keep
others from being infected?

40:12.395 --> 40:14.071
That's what we're gonna test next.

40:14.111 --> 40:16.354
We've set up this whole space again,
totally clean.

40:16.939 --> 40:18.241
I haven't touched anything here.

40:18.358 --> 40:20.214
I will have the same
drip rig going on,

40:20.329 --> 40:22.010
dripping at the same rate,

40:22.323 --> 40:25.951
except I'm going to be trying
to keep my germs from spreading

40:26.088 --> 40:29.015
to any parts of this table
and any of my guests.

40:29.255 --> 40:30.229
Let's see how I do.

40:31.322 --> 40:34.480
So, the Mythbusters will repeat
the nasal-secretions test...

40:35.300 --> 40:36.022
Pow!

40:36.375 --> 40:38.012
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:38.255 --> 40:40.010
Hello. Good to see you.

40:40.169 --> 40:41.720
...With two vital differences.

40:41.876 --> 40:46.233
Adam will do everything he can
not to spread his pseudo-snot,

40:46.429 --> 40:50.059
and we've got a new set of
blissfully unaware test subjects.

40:50.137 --> 40:51.174
But I've got to warn you...

40:51.175 --> 40:54.873
I've got a little bit of a cold,
so let's do an elbow greet.

40:54.959 --> 40:56.447
How are you? How are you?

40:56.448 --> 40:58.315
But will modifying his behavior

40:58.316 --> 41:00.717
decrease the chances
of contamination?

41:00.718 --> 41:03.787
He's not shaking hands.
He's bumping elbows.

41:03.788 --> 41:06.823
Despite the fact that his
nose is still dripping

41:06.824 --> 41:08.659
at 60 mils per hour,

41:08.660 --> 41:11.061
Adam is doing all he can to limit

41:11.062 --> 41:13.830
his hand-to-hand contact
with his guests.

41:13.831 --> 41:16.939
And, Tory, if you would take this

41:16.940 --> 41:19.136
and hand out a sheet
to everybody...

41:19.251 --> 41:21.738
Dana, if you would pass
these pens to your...

41:22.033 --> 41:23.031
pass these pens to your right

41:23.032 --> 41:25.108
and make sure everyone gets a pen.

41:25.109 --> 41:27.471
- We're gonna play a game called dictionary.
- Oh!

41:27.657 --> 41:30.593
But as well as avoiding direct
contact with his guests,

41:30.594 --> 41:34.997
Adam's also avoiding indirect
contact by enlisting their help.

41:34.998 --> 41:37.066
Dana, will you hand out the
glasses for me, please?

41:37.228 --> 41:39.703
At this point, it looks
like he's doing pretty well

41:39.704 --> 41:42.538
because the only thing that's
actually been passed around,

41:42.539 --> 41:45.608
person-to-person,
has been the paper notes.

41:45.609 --> 41:47.309
The glasses, the bottle,

41:47.310 --> 41:49.756
even meeting everybody
in the beginning,

41:49.757 --> 41:52.268
didn't involve any
kind of contact at all.

41:54.118 --> 41:57.401
And once again,
the 30 minutes seems to fly by

41:57.520 --> 42:00.018
until it's time to
bring in the bouncer.

42:00.777 --> 42:01.779
All right, then.

42:01.896 --> 42:04.281
So, everybody's had some cake,
some champagne,

42:04.398 --> 42:05.552
you've played a couple of games.

42:05.651 --> 42:06.508
Lovely party!

42:06.744 --> 42:08.241
Time to call it quits.

42:08.415 --> 42:10.349
Jamie says it's time to go,
it's time to go.

42:11.485 --> 42:13.619
Wow! What a buzzkill. Right?

42:13.620 --> 42:15.721
And with that, the test is over.

42:15.722 --> 42:18.691
But has Adam kept
his snot to himself?

42:18.692 --> 42:21.060
Bye-bye. Bye.

42:21.061 --> 42:23.129
Okay. Let's see your hands.

42:23.130 --> 42:24.230
You're clean.

42:24.231 --> 42:25.998
You're clean.

42:25.999 --> 42:30.436
Well, the result is spelled
out in no neon light.

42:30.437 --> 42:32.605
Clean.

42:32.606 --> 42:33.773
Clean.

42:34.459 --> 42:35.733
Good job, Adam.

42:35.976 --> 42:38.411
In stark contrast to
the previous test,

42:38.412 --> 42:42.494
amazingly, Adam has not
infected a single guest.

42:42.849 --> 42:44.401
I got to say,
that was totally amazing.

42:44.519 --> 42:46.920
Just by a simple
change of technique,

42:47.234 --> 42:50.394
you can prevent everyone at
the party from getting sick.

42:53.885 --> 42:54.812
Let's recap.

42:54.813 --> 42:56.206
The myth that if you are sick,

42:56.284 --> 42:58.525
your nasal secretions
will go everywhere.

42:58.956 --> 42:59.579
Confirmed.

43:00.518 --> 43:02.560
And the ability as
an innocent bystander

43:02.561 --> 43:05.237
for one to avoid those secretions.

43:05.238 --> 43:08.474
Not impossible but very difficult.

43:08.475 --> 43:09.402
So, what have we concluded

43:09.520 --> 43:11.003
is the best way to
prevent the spread?

43:11.178 --> 43:12.154
Well, if you're sick,

43:12.270 --> 43:14.614
you need to take some
personal responsibility.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.137
Absolutely right.

43:16.383 --> 43:17.905
This has been a
public-service announcement

43:17.961 --> 43:20.118
from Jamie and Adam at
"Mythbusters."
