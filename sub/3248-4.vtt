00:08.440 --> 00:13.200
Ow! Come on! Stop struggling.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.120
You're gonna regret this!
Completely ridiculous!

00:16.160 --> 00:18.800
Get your hands off me! Ah!

00:20.880 --> 00:24.400
I think that makes my answer clear.
Don't you?

00:24.440 --> 00:28.280
Oh, and, er... If you're gonna
go to print, spell my name right.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.240
Rattigan, with two Ts.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.440
Oh, this goes way beyond
the newspapers!

00:33.480 --> 00:38.000
This thing's worldwide!
I'm telling you, ATMOS is dangerous.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.000
But if you had proof,
then you wouldn't be here. Fine.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.440
If you won't listen,
I'll find someone else who will.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.320
SAT-NAV: 'Welcome.
What is your destination?'

00:54.360 --> 00:56.920
Oh, shut up,
you're the last thing I need.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.440
'ATMOS cannot be disabled.'
SHE SIGHS

00:59.480 --> 01:01.080
Right, then.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.920
Take me to UNIT headquarters.
Tower Bridge, London.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.840
'UNIT headquarters.'
Her name's Jo Nakashima.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.560
Freelance journalist.
Clever, by the sound of it.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.320
Not as clever as me,
but that goes without saying.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.960
I'd recommend...termination.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.080
Remember your status, boy.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.280
We do not take orders from humans.

01:22.320 --> 01:25.000
I said...recommend.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.480
Then your advice shows military
wisdom. She will be terminated.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.560
Cool.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.920
ANSWERPHONE: 'This is UNIT extension
221...' Not answerphone!

01:37.960 --> 01:39.720
BEEP

01:39.760 --> 01:44.320
Yes, this is a message for
Colonel Mace, from Jo, Jo Nakashima.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.600
Look, you should've got my e-mail.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.440
I've been investigating deaths
related to ATMOS systems.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.680
SAT-NAV: 'Go straight on.'
I can't prove anything,
but there's got to be a link.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.560
I need you to check out the people
who died in ATMOS cars yesterday -

01:58.600 --> 01:59.720
check out the time.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.320
SAT-NAV: 'Turn right.'

02:06.240 --> 02:07.800
I don't believe this.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.639
SAT-NAV: 'This is your
final destination.'

02:10.680 --> 02:12.360
I said take me to UNIT!

02:13.480 --> 02:16.320
SAT-NAV: 'Go straight on.'
I don't think so.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.280
I'll find my own way, thanks.

destination...' No!

02:25.840 --> 02:30.000
'This is your final destination...'
No! Help!

02:30.040 --> 02:33.520
'This is your final destination.'
No! No! No!

02:33.560 --> 02:35.640
NO!

02:44.520 --> 02:47.000
I can't believe I'm doing this!

02:47.040 --> 02:49.760
No, neither can I. Ooh, careful.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.160
Left hand down. Left hand down!

02:56.360 --> 02:58.600
You're getting a bit
too close to the 1980s!

02:58.640 --> 03:02.120
What am I gonna do,
put a dent in them? Someone did.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.120
BEEPING
Hold on.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.640
That's a phone!

03:11.040 --> 03:13.200
You've got a mobile? Since when?

03:13.240 --> 03:14.560
It's not mine.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.520
Hello.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.520
Doctor? It's Martha.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.000
And I'm bringing you back to earth.

Martha Jones.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.840
Doctor.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.440
You haven't changed a bit!
Neither have you! How's the family?

04:37.480 --> 04:40.040
You know, not so bad. Recovering.
What about you?

04:41.920 --> 04:43.760
Right.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.000
I should've known. Didn't take
you long to replace me, then.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.480
Don't fight!
Martha, Donna, Donna, Martha.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.520
Please don't fight,
I can't bear it.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.440
You wish!
I've heard all about you.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.000
He talks about you all the time.
I dread to think.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.080
No, no, no, no. He says nice things!

04:58.120 --> 05:00.720
Good things! Nice things.
Really good things.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.240
He's told you everything!

05:02.280 --> 05:04.840
Didn't take you long
to get over it, though.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.960
Who's the lucky man?
Lucky what?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.640
She's engaged, you prawn.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.320
Really? Who to?
Tom, that Tom Milligan.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.240
He's in paediatrics,
working out in Africa right now.

05:14.280 --> 05:19.040
I know - a doctor who disappears off
to distant places. Tell me about it.
Is he skinny?

05:19.080 --> 05:22.200
No, he's sort of...strong.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.920
HE is too skinny for words! You
give him a hug, you get a paper cut!

05:25.960 --> 05:28.840
Oh! I'd rather you were fighting!
Speaking of which...

05:28.880 --> 05:31.360
'Dr Jones, come in. Over.'
This is Doctor Jones.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.840
Operation Blue Sky is go, go, go.
I repeat, this is a go!

05:42.960 --> 05:47.520
Unified Intelligence Taskforce!
Raise that barrier now!

05:56.200 --> 05:59.760
Leave your safeties on, lads,
it's non-hostiles.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.840
LOUD-HAILER: Workers,
lay down your tools and surrender.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.400
Greyhound Six to Trap One.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.960
B Section, go, go, go! Search the
ground floor, grid pattern Delta.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.520
What are you searching for?
Illegal aliens.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.920
This is a UNIT operation!

06:12.960 --> 06:17.840
All workers lay down your
tools and surrender immediately.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.520
This is a UNIT operation!

06:19.560 --> 06:22.920
B Section mobilised!
E Section, F Section, on my command!

06:22.960 --> 06:24.960
Is that what you did to her?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.320
Turned her into a soldier?

06:31.160 --> 06:34.680
As predicted. The UNIT forces have
moved to the penultimate stage.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.920
Observe their troops. Thin fabrics.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.720
Exposed skin. Feeble weapons.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.880
These are toy soldiers!
The playthings of children!

06:51.760 --> 06:53.200
And you're qualified now?

06:53.240 --> 06:56.480
UNIT rushed it through, given my
field experience. Here we go.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.000
We're establishing
a field base on site.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.000
They're dying to meet you.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.320
Wish I could say the same.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.960
Operation Blue Sky complete, sir.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.280
Thanks for letting me take the lead.
And this...is the Doctor.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.320
Doctor, Colonel Mace. Sir!

07:15.360 --> 07:18.800
Oh, don't salute.
But it's an honour, sir.
I've read all the files.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.920
Technically, you're still
on staff. You never resigned.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.920
What, you used to work for them?

07:23.960 --> 07:27.080
Yeah, long time ago.
Back in the '70s.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.480
Or was it the '80s? It was all
a bit more homespun back then.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.840
Times have changed, sir.
Yeah, that's enough of the "sir".

07:33.880 --> 07:36.320
Doctor, you've been
on board the Valiant.

07:36.360 --> 07:41.360
We've got massive funding from
the United Nations. All in the name
of homeworld security.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.240
A modern UNIT for the modern world.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.840
Arresting ordinary factory workers?

07:45.880 --> 07:48.200
In the street? In broad daylight?

07:48.240 --> 07:51.240
It's like Guantanamo Bay out there.
Donna, by the way.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.960
Donna Noble, since you didn't ask.
I'll have a salute.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.160
Ma'am.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.720
Thank you.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.040
So tell me.
What's going on in that factory?

08:03.080 --> 08:06.200
Yesterday, 52 people died
in identical circumstances.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.000
Right across the world,
in 11 different time zones.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.960
5am in the UK, 6am in France,
8am in Moscow, 1pm in China...

08:14.000 --> 08:15.400
Simultaneously?

08:15.440 --> 08:19.520
Exactly. 52 deaths, at the exact
same moment, worldwide.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.880
How?
They were all inside their cars.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.640
Poisoned. I checked
the biopsies, no toxins.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.320
Whatever it is,
left the system immediately.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.760
What have the cars got in common?
They're all fitted with ATMOS.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.360
And that is the ATMOS factory.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.960
What's ATMOS?
Oh, come on. Even I know that.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.039
Everyone's got ATMOS! Stands
for Atmospheric Omission System.

08:39.080 --> 08:43.400
Fit ATMOS in your car, it reduces
CO2 emissions to zero. Zero?!

08:43.440 --> 08:45.520
No carbon, none at all?

08:45.560 --> 08:49.720
Sat-nav and 20 quid in shopping
vouchers if you introduce a friend.
Bargain!

08:49.760 --> 08:53.040
And this is where they make it,
Doctor. Shipping worldwide.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.080
17 factories worldwide,
but this is the central depot -

08:56.120 --> 08:59.760
sending ATMOS to every country on
earth. And you think ATMOS is alien?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.920
It's our job to investigate
that possibility. Doctor?

09:06.080 --> 09:07.920
SOLDIER: Come on, look lively.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.760
Up the pace.
We haven't got all day now!

09:11.760 --> 09:14.120
And here it is, laid bare.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.360
ATMOS can be threaded through
any and every make of car.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.160
You must've checked it.
We did, we found nothing.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.720
That's why I thought we needed
an expert. Really, who did you get?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
Oh, right! Me! Yes! Good.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.120
OK, so why would aliens be so keen
on cleaning up our atmosphere?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.920
Very good question.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.680
Maybe they want to help.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.520
Get rid of pollution and stuff.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.880
Do you know how many cars
there are on planet earth?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.600
800 million.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.120
Imagine that.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.360
If you could control them,
you'd have 800 million weapons.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.960
We should head back.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.480
There's not much down here. Should
be just boiler rooms, generators.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.440
Aye, aye.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.960
What's this, then?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.920
You two. All personnel have
been ordered to evacuate.
The building's under UNIT control.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.960
This area is out of bounds.
Excuse me, sunshine?

10:27.520 --> 10:29.720
I think you'll find we're in charge.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.240
We can do this the easy way...

10:34.280 --> 10:35.920
or the hard way.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.880
General Staal. They are close.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.120
Excellent! And like a good warrior,

10:41.160 --> 10:44.000
I shall enter the fray myself!
Let them pass.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.840
It's open. Oh.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.680
Come on.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.600
HISSING

11:14.800 --> 11:16.280
What the hell?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.080
Greyhound 16 to Trap One.

11:22.120 --> 11:27.480
We've found something. Basement
corridor, north side, grid 36.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.120
Request backup, over.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.320
HISSING CONTINUES

11:35.360 --> 11:37.080
It's like something boiling...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.280
Don't touch it! Come on, Steve!

11:43.320 --> 11:46.000
We get first rights on this.
That means promotion!

11:46.040 --> 11:48.280
Just leave it alone!

11:48.320 --> 11:50.120
Wait for back up.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.360
THUD
What was that?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.440
Came from inside.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.680
Could just be the machinery.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.160
THUD

12:08.320 --> 12:09.640
THUD

12:09.680 --> 12:13.320
Is there someone in there? Hello?

12:13.360 --> 12:15.240
THUDDING

12:15.280 --> 12:16.960
We've got to get this open.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.560
We should wait!
You could suffocate in there!

12:21.240 --> 12:24.720
Greyhound 16 to Trap One,
request immediate assistance.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.080
Repeat, immediate assistance, over.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.200
How do you work this thing? Come on!

12:31.520 --> 12:33.320
ALARM BLARES

12:39.520 --> 12:41.440
HE COUGHS

12:41.480 --> 12:43.960
Oh, God, it stinks!

12:46.160 --> 12:47.880
What the hell is that stuff?

12:56.640 --> 12:58.960
Identify yourself! Identify!

13:00.600 --> 13:03.480
Greyhound 16 declaring
absolute emergency, sir.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.320
Repeat, absolute emergency, over!

13:06.360 --> 13:10.120
Can you hear me?
Can you understand me?

13:10.160 --> 13:12.640
Look at its neck.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.040
It's like...an umbilical cord.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.360
Well, don't get too close.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.080
I think it's harmless.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.200
I don't even think
it's properly alive.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.960
It's gonna drown. No...

13:29.280 --> 13:31.520
I think it breathes this stuff.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.480
Like some kind of embryo.
What do you mean, an embryo?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.960
Someone's growing a body.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.640
A human body.
Excellent skills of deduction.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.800
I would rate you above average,
soldier. Well done.

13:47.840 --> 13:51.760
Whereas you,
you smell of sweat and fear.

13:51.800 --> 13:56.440
Yeah? Well, we're not the ones who
got out of school early, sonny.

13:56.480 --> 14:01.720
Stop playing Humpty Dumpty
and tell us who you are.
Is that a reference to my height?

14:01.760 --> 14:04.680
Short answer, yes. A pity.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.920
Words are the weapons of womenfolk.
I must judge you unfit!

14:08.960 --> 14:12.760
Oh! What you gonna do,
bite our ankles?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.960
HE SCREAMS

14:16.000 --> 14:19.600
I'm warning you!
A proper soldier gives no warning!

14:19.640 --> 14:21.320
Fire! I order you! Fire!

14:21.360 --> 14:22.680
GUN CLICKS

14:22.720 --> 14:26.320
The room is contained within
a Cordolaine signal,

14:26.360 --> 14:28.640
exciting the copper surface
of the bullet

14:28.680 --> 14:33.600
and causing expansion within the
barrel, rendering your guns useless.

14:33.640 --> 14:38.360
And your radio signals
have been blocked. Agh!

14:42.480 --> 14:45.040
My legs! I can't feel my legs!

14:45.080 --> 14:47.720
I apologise for disabling you.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.680
Death has more honour,

14:49.720 --> 14:52.680
but you are needed
for the stratagem.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.120
Prepare them for processing.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.400
You spoke of promotion.
Now you will serve a greater cause.

14:58.440 --> 15:03.800
But...who are you?
Indeed, know your enemy!

15:03.840 --> 15:07.240
I am General Staal of the
10th Sontaran Battle Fleet.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.160
Known as Staal the Undefeated!

15:13.240 --> 15:14.400
Help us!

15:15.400 --> 15:16.720
Oh, my God, help us!

15:16.760 --> 15:21.960
Ionising nano membrane
carbon dioxide converter -
which means that ATMOS works.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.800
Filters CO2 at a molecular level.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.600
We know all that,
but what's its origin? Is it alien?

15:26.640 --> 15:28.520
No. Decades ahead of its time.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.840
Do you mind? Could you stand back?
Have I done something wrong?

15:31.880 --> 15:35.880
I don't like people with
guns hanging around me, all right?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.440
If you insist.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.640
Tetchy.
Well, it's true. He's a good man.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.040
People with guns are usually
the enemy, in my books.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.800
You seem at home.
You got me used to fighting.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.440
Oh, right, so it's my fault.
You got me the job!

15:53.440 --> 15:54.520
Besides, look at me.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.200
Am I carrying a gun? Suppose not.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.680
It's all right for you.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.320
You can just come and go, but
some of us have got to stay behind.

16:04.360 --> 16:07.680
I've got to work from the inside
and by staying inside,

16:07.720 --> 16:10.760
maybe I stand a chance
of making them better. Yeah?

16:13.920 --> 16:17.240
That's more like Martha Jones.
I learned from the best.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.080
Well... Oi, you lot!

16:19.120 --> 16:22.040
All your storm troopers
and your sonics...

16:22.080 --> 16:24.040
Rubbish! You should've come with me.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.040
Why, where have you been? Personnel.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.200
That's where the weird stuff's
happening - paperwork.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.920
I worked as a temp for years -
I can find my way
round an office blindfold,

16:32.960 --> 16:35.800
and the first thing
I noticed is an empty file.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.560
Why, what's inside it?
Or what's not inside it?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.480
Sick days -

16:40.520 --> 16:45.440
there aren't any. Hundreds of people
working here and no one's sick -

16:45.480 --> 16:49.680
not one hangover, man flu,
sneaky little shopping trip, nothing.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.000
Not ever! They don't get ill.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.000
That can't be right.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.560
You've been checking out
the building -

16:56.600 --> 16:59.240
should've been
checking out the workforce.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.280
I can see why he likes you. Mm-hmm.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.520
You are good. Super temp!

17:03.560 --> 17:07.119
Doctor Jones, set up a medical post,
start examining the workers.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.480
I'll get them sent through.
Come on, Donna. Gimme a hand.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.960
So, this ATMOS thing -
where did it come from?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.359
Luke Rattigan himself.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.640
And himself would be?

17:17.760 --> 17:19.319
Child genius.

17:19.359 --> 17:24.280
Invented the Fountain Six search
engine when he was 12 years old.
Millionaire overnight.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.000
Now runs the Rattigan Academy -

17:26.040 --> 17:30.120
a private school, educating students
hand picked from all over the world.

17:30.160 --> 17:34.240
A hot-house for geniuses wouldn't
mind going there. I get lonely.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.760
Do you think I should warn my mum...
about the ATMOS in her car?

17:45.800 --> 17:49.120
Better safe than sorry.
I'll give her a call.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.160
Donna.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.120
Do they know where
you are, your family?

17:54.160 --> 17:57.000
I mean, that you're travelling
with the Doctor?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.880
Not really.

17:58.920 --> 18:03.240
Although my grandad
sort of waved us off,
but I didn't have time to explain.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.800
You just left him behind? Yeah.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.680
I didn't tell my family,

18:11.720 --> 18:13.640
kept it all so secret,

18:13.680 --> 18:15.560
and it almost destroyed them.

18:15.600 --> 18:20.120
In what way? They ended up
imprisoned, they were tortured.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.760
My mum, my dad, my sister.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.080
It wasn't the Doctor's fault,

18:26.120 --> 18:27.920
but you need to be careful.

18:27.960 --> 18:32.040
Cos you know the Doctor,
he's wonderful, he's brilliant,

18:32.080 --> 18:34.280
but he's like fire.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.280
Stand too close
and people get burned.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.400
Conditioning is complete.

18:48.440 --> 18:52.680
Now do your duty
and advance the conquest.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.200
Yes, sir.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.080
General Staal returning.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.400
The stratagem advances.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.520
The last days of planet earth.

19:12.080 --> 19:16.400
You are not coming with me!
I want to talk to Luke Rattigan,
not point a gun at him.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.160
It's ten miles outside London.
Then get me a Jeep!

19:19.200 --> 19:21.760
According to the records,
you travel by TARDIS.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.400
If there are hostile aliens,

19:23.440 --> 19:26.280
it's best to keep
a super-duper time machine safe.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.800
So you do have weapons, but you
choose to keep them hidden. Jenkins!

19:29.840 --> 19:33.920
Sir. You will accompany the Doctor
and take orders from him!
I don't do orders.

19:33.960 --> 19:38.840
Any sign of trouble, get Jenkins
to declare a Code Red and good luck,
sir. I said no salutes.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.600
Now you're giving orders.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.360
You're getting
a bit cheeky, you are. Doctor...

19:43.400 --> 19:45.640
Just in time!
We're going to the country.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.240
Fresh air and geniuses -
what more could you ask?

19:48.280 --> 19:49.560
I'm not coming with you.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.680
I've been thinking.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.640
I'm sorry. I'm going home.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.800
Really? I've got to.

20:00.840 --> 20:03.720
Well, if that's what you want.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.800
I mean, it's a bit soon.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.240
I had so many places
I wanted to take you.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.080
The Fifteenth Broken Moon
of the Medusa Cascade,

20:15.120 --> 20:17.840
the Lightning Skies
of Cotter Palluni's World,

20:17.880 --> 20:21.200
the Diamond Coral Reefs
of Kataa Flo Ko...

20:26.040 --> 20:27.200
Thank you.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.800
Thank you, Donna Noble.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.360
It's been brilliant.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.040
You saved my life, in so many ways.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.000
You're...

20:39.040 --> 20:43.640
You're just popping home
for a visit, that's what you mean.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.200
You dumbo.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.480
Then you're coming back.
Know what you are?

20:47.520 --> 20:51.320
A great big, outer-space dunce.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.680
Yeah. Ready when you are, sir!

20:53.720 --> 20:57.360
What's more, you can give me a lift.
Come on!

20:58.720 --> 21:01.320
Broken moon of what? I know, I know!

21:06.720 --> 21:09.680
And your name's Treppa, yeah?
Is that Polish?

21:09.720 --> 21:13.680
We're not checking passports, but did
you come from Poland just to work?

21:13.720 --> 21:17.000
I came to do my job. OK.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.000
I need to listen to your heartbeat.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.760
This might be a bit cold. Lift.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.840
RAPID BEATING

21:29.320 --> 21:31.840
RAPID BEATING

21:31.880 --> 21:34.520
Are you on any medication?
I'm here to work.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.280
How many hours a day do you work?

21:36.320 --> 21:39.280
24. You work 24 hours a day?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.560
Down.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.320
Mr Treppa, have you ever
had any form of hypnosis?

21:45.360 --> 21:47.360
I'm here to work.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.560
OK. Um...

21:49.600 --> 21:52.040
If you could just wait here...

21:57.360 --> 22:01.040
Doctor Jones.
Not now, I'm busy. Just one question.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.120
Do you have security clearance
level one? Yes, I do. Why?

22:04.160 --> 22:08.200
Colonel Mace wants to see you.
Oh, good, cos I want to see him.
Where is he?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.560
Come with us.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.720
I'll walk the rest of the way.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.120
I'll see you back
at the factory, yeah? Bye!

22:24.160 --> 22:25.640
And you be careful!

22:43.240 --> 22:46.080
Haven't seen you for days.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.560
Been away.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.280
SCREAMING

22:57.320 --> 23:00.240
Hold on! I am!

23:20.320 --> 23:22.280
I'm waving at fat.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.360
Why's he down here?
He asked to see you.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.680
Has he found something?

24:23.560 --> 24:25.520
BUBBLING

24:29.640 --> 24:31.680
SHE GASPS AND STRUGGLES

24:33.720 --> 24:37.640
DISTANT SCREAMING

24:38.640 --> 24:41.080
I said so, didn't I? Aliens!

24:41.120 --> 24:45.000
I said they was real! I just didn't
expect them in a little blue box.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.600
It's bigger on the inside.

24:46.640 --> 24:51.240
Yeah, but is it safe?
This Doctor, are you safe with him?

24:51.280 --> 24:56.080
He's amazing, Gramps.
He's just...dazzling.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.600
And never tell him I said that.
No. But I'd trust him with my life.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.840
Hold up! I thought that was my job!
You still come first.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.960
For God's sake,
don't tell your mother!

25:05.000 --> 25:06.600
I dunno.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.040
I mean, this is massive.

25:09.080 --> 25:13.280
It's sort of not fair if she doesn't
know. Doesn't know what?

25:13.320 --> 25:15.080
And who's she, the cat's mother?

25:15.120 --> 25:19.600
And where've you been
these past few days, lady,
after that trick with the car keys?

25:19.640 --> 25:21.880
Veena said
she hadn't seen hide nor hair.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.320
I've just been...travelling.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.640
Oh, hark at her - Michael Palin!

25:26.680 --> 25:28.920
Are you having tea?
I haven't got anything.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.360
I've been trying to keep your
grandad on that macrobiotic diet,

25:32.400 --> 25:35.400
but he sneaks off and gets pork pies
at the petrol station.

25:35.440 --> 25:39.560
Don't deny it. I've seen the wrappers
in the car. I don't miss a trick!

25:39.600 --> 25:42.520
Now then, what were you gonna
tell me? What don't I know?

25:46.000 --> 25:50.120
Nothing. Just...nothing.

25:50.160 --> 25:53.400
Good. Right then, you can sit
there and cut out those coupons.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.240
Every penny helps. This new
mortgage doesn't pay for itself.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.040
Dad, kettle on. Yeah, kettle on.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.320
UNIT's been watching
the Rattigan Academy for ages.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.880
It's all a bit Hitler Youth -

26:05.920 --> 26:08.680
exercise at dawn
and classes and special diets.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.920
SAT-NAV: 'Turn left.'

26:09.960 --> 26:13.000
Ross, one question.
If UNIT think that ATMOS is dodgy...

26:13.040 --> 26:14.840
How come it's in the Jeeps? Yeah.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.400
Tell me about it. It's standard
in all government vehicles.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.200
We can't get rid of them
till we can prove something.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.320
'Turn right.'
Drives me round the bend.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.360
Oh, nice one!

26:24.400 --> 26:26.200
I timed that perfectly. Yeah.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.320
Yeah, you did.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.200
'This is your final destination.'

26:43.440 --> 26:46.080
Is it PE?
I wouldn't mind a kick around.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.720
I've got my daps on.

26:47.760 --> 26:50.000
Suppose you're the Doctor. Hello.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.240
Your commanding officer
phoned ahead.

26:52.280 --> 26:56.000
Ah, but I haven't got a commanding
officer. Have you?

26:56.040 --> 26:58.680
Oh, this is Ross. Say hello, Ross.
Afternoon, sir.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.800
Let's have a look, then.
I can smell genius! In a good way.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.360
Oh, now!

27:08.400 --> 27:10.840
That's clever, look!

27:10.880 --> 27:13.480
Single molecule fabric -
how thin is that?

27:13.520 --> 27:15.440
You could pack a tent in a thimble!

27:15.480 --> 27:17.400
Ooh! Gravity simulators.

27:19.640 --> 27:24.160
Terraforming, biospheres,
nano tech steel construction.

27:25.440 --> 27:30.080
This is brilliant! Do you know,
with equipment like this,
you could, ooh, I don't know...

27:30.120 --> 27:32.200
move to another planet
or something...

27:33.240 --> 27:34.720
If only that was possible.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.560
If only that WERE possible.

27:37.600 --> 27:42.400
Conditional clause.
I think you'd better come with me.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.600
You're smarter than the usual
UNIT grunts, all right.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.800
He called you a grunt!
Don't call Ross a grunt. He's nice!

27:51.840 --> 27:54.720
We like Ross. Look at this!
What exactly do you want?

27:54.760 --> 27:58.120
I was just thinking,
what a responsible 18-year-old!

27:58.160 --> 28:01.320
Inventing zero-carbon cars,

28:01.360 --> 28:04.120
saving the world...

28:04.160 --> 28:06.120
Takes a man with vision.

28:06.160 --> 28:10.040
But ATMOS means more people driving.
More cars, more petrol -

28:10.080 --> 28:14.000
the oil will run out faster. The
ATMOS system could make it worse.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.280
See, that's tautology.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.880
You can't say "ATMOS system" -

28:16.920 --> 28:19.240
it stands for
Atmospheric Omission System,

28:19.280 --> 28:22.400
so you're saying "Atmospheric
Omission System system".

28:22.440 --> 28:24.120
See, Mr "Conditional Clause"?

28:24.160 --> 28:27.520
It's been a long time since anyone
said no to you, hasn't it?

28:27.560 --> 28:29.240
I'm still right though.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.760
Not easy, is it, being clever?

28:33.320 --> 28:37.360
You look at the world and you
connect things, random things.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.160
You think,
Why can't anyone else see it?

28:40.200 --> 28:42.880
The rest of the world is so slow.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.160
Yeah. You're all on your own.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.760
I know.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.280
But not with this! There's no way
you invented this single-handed.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.640
Earth technology, but like finding
a mobile phone in the Middle Ages.
No, I'll tell you what it's like -

28:55.680 --> 28:58.280
it's like finding THIS
in someone's front room,

28:58.320 --> 29:00.560
albeit a very big front room.
What is it?

29:00.600 --> 29:03.920
Yeah. Just looks like a "thing".
People don't question things.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.520
They think, "Just a thing."
Leave it alone.

29:06.560 --> 29:09.920
I make these connections,
and this looks like a teleport pod.

29:13.600 --> 29:20.080
Oh! 'Orbit now holding at 556.3,
sector 270.'

29:20.120 --> 29:21.760
We have an intruder!

29:21.800 --> 29:24.360
How did he get in?
"In-tru-der window"?!

29:25.400 --> 29:27.400
Bye-bye!

29:27.440 --> 29:29.720
Ross, get out!
Luke, come with me.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.920
Sontaran!

29:35.600 --> 29:37.000
That's your name, isn't it?

29:37.040 --> 29:39.320
You're a Sontaran.
How did I know that, eh?

29:39.360 --> 29:42.640
Fascinating, isn't it?
Isn't that worth keeping me alive?

29:42.680 --> 29:46.280
I order you to surrender, in the
name of UNIT. That's not gonna work.

29:46.320 --> 29:50.280
Cordolaine signal, am I right?
Copper excitation -
stops the bullets.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.400
How do you know so much? Well...

29:52.440 --> 29:54.320
Who is he? He didn't give his name.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.960
This isn't typical
Sontaran behaviour, is it?

29:57.000 --> 30:00.280
Hiding, using teenagers,
stopping bullets...

30:00.320 --> 30:03.800
A Sontaran should face bullets
with dignity! Shame on you!

30:03.840 --> 30:06.880
You dishonour me, sir!
Yeah? Then show yourself!

30:06.920 --> 30:09.280
I will look into my enemy's eyes!

30:19.480 --> 30:21.240
Oh, my God! And your name?

30:21.280 --> 30:26.480
General Staal of the 10th Sontaran
Fleet. Staal the Undefeated!

30:26.520 --> 30:28.720
What if you DO get defeated?

30:28.760 --> 30:31.360
Not Quite So Undefeated Any More,
But Never Mind?

30:31.400 --> 30:34.920
He's like a potato. A baked potato,
a talking baked potato.

30:34.960 --> 30:39.000
Now, Ross, don't be rude.
You look like a pink weasel to him.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.760
The Sontarans are
the finest soldiers in the galaxy,

30:42.800 --> 30:44.440
dedicated to a life of warfare.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.800
A clone race, grown in batches of
millions - only one weakness.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.320
Sontarans have no weakness!

30:49.360 --> 30:51.800
A good weakness.
Aren't you meant to be clever?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.480
Only an idiot would provoke him.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.240
They're fed by a probic vent
in the back of their neck -

30:56.280 --> 30:57.600
that's their weak spot -

30:57.640 --> 31:00.240
so they have to face
their enemies in battle.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.640
Brilliant -
they can never turn their back.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.640
We stare into the face of death!

31:05.680 --> 31:08.040
Yeah? Well, stare at this.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.920
STAAL SCREAMS

31:11.960 --> 31:13.680
What have you done?!

31:26.320 --> 31:27.720
Don't touch me!

31:28.520 --> 31:32.960
A Sontaran would rather be
court martialled than show pain.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.400
I must return.
But he broke the teleport.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.160
Pah! Primitive sonic trickery!

31:41.600 --> 31:43.520
The device is now repaired.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.520
Our presence is known.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.080
Soldiers, we move to a war footing!

31:53.120 --> 31:56.720
I see you face battle open skinned,
sir. Might I share that honour?

31:56.760 --> 31:58.680
You may.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.200
Thank you.

32:04.720 --> 32:10.720
How...do you tell each other apart?
We say the same of humans.

32:10.760 --> 32:14.520
Tell me, boy. How many ATMOS
devices have been installed?

32:14.560 --> 32:17.240
They've gone worldwide,
but only about half.

32:17.280 --> 32:22.160
Which means 400 million cars
converted - a fine arsenal!

32:22.200 --> 32:23.880
Sufficient for conversion?

32:23.920 --> 32:27.520
More than enough, yeah, and that
test signal proved that it works.

32:27.560 --> 32:30.320
52 deaths in the same second.
Man, that is so cool!

32:30.360 --> 32:32.520
Is the temperature significant?

32:35.640 --> 32:38.520
No, that's just a phrase.

32:39.600 --> 32:43.080
I'll get my people ready, General.
Just tell me where and when.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.080
Have we infiltrated UNIT?
The process is about to begin.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.960
Then you'll see it completed,
Commander Skorr! Get to it!

32:50.000 --> 32:51.480
Yes, sir!

33:00.880 --> 33:04.000
Is someone gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

33:05.960 --> 33:07.760
OK...

33:10.040 --> 33:14.440
So, listen,
you're not the first aliens I've met.
Just tell me who you are.

33:14.480 --> 33:18.440
Commander Skorr
of the 10th Sontaran Battle Fleet,

33:18.480 --> 33:22.440
known as Skorr the Bloodbringer.
What have you done to those two?

33:22.480 --> 33:26.200
Simple hypnotic control,
as with the factory drones,

33:26.240 --> 33:29.400
but with you,
we need something more complex.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.720
What...is that?!

33:40.760 --> 33:43.440
Soon, THAT will be you.

33:49.920 --> 33:53.600
COMPUTER: ATMOS devices
operating at 100% efficiency.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.840
COMPUTERS BLEEP

34:00.040 --> 34:01.400
Continue.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.920
War can never come too soon.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.880
Take your last look, boy.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.719
It was never big enough for me.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.760
I like your ambition.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.679
That Doctor, he was in a UNIT jeep.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.560
It should have ATMOS installed.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.679
You said you didn't know his name.

34:38.239 --> 34:41.639
I don't. He just said Doctor.
Does that mean something?

34:41.679 --> 34:45.719
There is an enemy of the Sontarans
known as the Doctor,

34:45.760 --> 34:47.400
a face changer.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.159
Do you mean he's an alien, too?

34:49.199 --> 34:52.560
Legend says he led the battle
in the last great Time War.

34:52.600 --> 34:57.680
The finest war in history, and we
weren't allowed to be part of it!

34:57.720 --> 34:59.800
Oh, but this is excellent!

34:59.840 --> 35:05.680
The last of the Time Lords will die
at the hands of the Sontaran Empire

35:05.720 --> 35:08.760
in the ruins of his precious earth.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.080
It is inadvisable to struggle.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.720
The female has a weak thorax.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.680
But what are you doing?
Completing mental transfer.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.840
The clone needs full memory access.
Clone?

35:47.760 --> 35:49.640
You can't...

35:54.120 --> 35:56.400
That's not... You will sleep, girl.

35:56.440 --> 36:00.840
Sleep, and keep the memories alive.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.080
Memories we can use - in battle.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.920
We have the Doctor's vehicle.

36:05.960 --> 36:12.200
An ordinary death for such
a remarkable enemy, but proceed.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.680
Greyhound 40 to Trap One.
Repeat, can you hear me? Over!

36:15.720 --> 36:18.160
Why's it not working?
Must be the Sontarans.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.720
If they can trace that, they
can isolate the ATMOS. 'Turn left.'

36:21.760 --> 36:25.320
Try going right. It said left.
I know, so go right.

36:25.360 --> 36:28.120
I've got no control.
It's driving itself!

36:28.160 --> 36:31.080
It won't stop! The doors are locked!

36:31.120 --> 36:33.960
Ah, it's deadlocked!
I can't stop it. Let me.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.280
The sat-nav's just a box
wired through the whole car!

36:37.320 --> 36:40.960
Is he going in the water?
I love it, with the water!

36:41.840 --> 36:43.720
We're heading for the river!

36:44.840 --> 36:48.400
ATMOS, are you programmed to
contradict my orders? 'Confirmed.'

36:48.440 --> 36:51.280
Anything I say, you ignore it?
'Confirmed.'

36:51.320 --> 36:55.920
Drive into the river!
I order you to drive into the river!
Do it! Drive into the river!

37:05.880 --> 37:08.720
'Turn right, left...' Get down!

37:08.760 --> 37:12.200
'Left, right, left, right, left...'
VOICE DISTORTS

37:12.240 --> 37:13.520
FAINT POP

37:16.880 --> 37:18.160
Oh, is that it?

37:18.200 --> 37:20.200
ATMOS terminated.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.480
Mission accomplished.
The Doctor is dead.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.040
Then prepare the weapons.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.680
Is the operative in place?

37:36.760 --> 37:40.480
Ready and waiting to advance
the great Sontaran cause, sir.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.000
Then go to work.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.160
DOORBELL

37:49.880 --> 37:52.280
You would not believe
the day I'm having.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.400
BEEPING
I'll requisition us a vehicle.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.600
Anything without ATMOS,
and don't point your gun at people!

38:08.640 --> 38:12.400
Is it him? Is it him?
Is it the Doctor?

38:12.440 --> 38:16.440
Ah! It's you! Who?

38:17.160 --> 38:20.480
Oh! It's you!

38:20.520 --> 38:22.400
What? Have you met before?

38:22.440 --> 38:25.800
Yeah, Christmas Eve.
He disappeared right in front of me!

38:25.840 --> 38:28.640
And you never said?
Well, you never said!

38:28.680 --> 38:30.680
Wilf, sir. Wilfred Mott.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.880
You must be one of them aliens!

38:32.920 --> 38:36.160
Yeah, but don't shout it out.
Nice to meet you properly, Wilf.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.120
An alien hand! Donna, anything?
She's not answering.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.440
What is it, "Sonteruns"?
Sont-ar-ans.
There must be more to it.

38:42.480 --> 38:47.680
They can't be just remote
controlling cars. That's not enough.
Is anyone answering? Hold on.

38:47.720 --> 38:51.160
Don't tell me...Donna Noble!
Martha! Hold on, he's here.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.640
Martha, tell Colonel Mace
it's the Sontarans.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.800
They're in the file -
Code Red Sontarans -

38:55.840 --> 39:00.000
but if they're inside,
tell him not to start shooting.
UNIT will get massacred.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.960
I'll get back as soon as I can.
Got that? Code Red Sontaran. Gotcha.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.160
Dr Jones, found anything yet?
No, sir. Nothing to report.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.800
You didn't find anything before.

39:14.840 --> 39:18.080
Yeah, but now I know it's Sontaran,
I know what I'm looking for.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.120
Doctor, Donna
is my only grandchild.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.520
Promise me you're gonna
take care of her.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.800
She takes care of me!
That's my Donna!

39:24.840 --> 39:27.800
She was always bossing us round,
even when she was tiny.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.600
The little General,
we used to call her. Don't start!

39:30.640 --> 39:33.680
And some of the boys!
A different one every week.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.800
Who was that one
with the nail varnish?

39:35.840 --> 39:40.320
Matthew Richards. He lives
in Kilburn now...with a man.

39:40.360 --> 39:45.160
Whoa! It's a temporal pocket. I knew
there was something else in there!

39:45.200 --> 39:48.080
It's hidden just a second
out of sync with real time.

39:48.120 --> 39:51.880
But what's it hiding?
I don't know - men and their cars!

39:51.920 --> 39:54.280
Sometimes I think, if I was a car...

39:54.320 --> 39:57.360
Oh, it's you! Doctor...what was it?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.160
That's me!

39:59.200 --> 40:02.360
Have you met him as well?
Dad, it's the man from the wedding,

40:02.400 --> 40:04.720
when you were laid up
with Spanish flu!

40:04.760 --> 40:08.480
I'm warning you, last time that man
turned up, it was a disaster.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.000
Get back!

40:11.040 --> 40:12.720
A converter has been activated.

40:12.760 --> 40:13.800
Show me where!

40:16.040 --> 40:18.160
London. That's Chiswick.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.880
Who could have such knowledge?

40:19.920 --> 40:22.160
Only the Doctor. He survived!

40:22.200 --> 40:27.160
Excellent! Then battle will
be joined. Glorious warfare!

40:27.200 --> 40:31.000
10th Sontaran Battle Fleet,
we move to the final phase!

40:31.040 --> 40:35.560
Prepare the subjugation of
earth for the glory of Sontar!

40:35.600 --> 40:38.000
Announcing Battle Status One.

40:38.040 --> 40:39.680
All soldiers to positions.

40:39.720 --> 40:43.160
Repeat, we are now
at Battle Status One.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.680
Rejoice!

40:56.560 --> 41:00.160
That'll stop it. I told you!

41:00.200 --> 41:02.400
He's blown up the car!

41:02.440 --> 41:06.600
Who is he anyway? What sort of doctor
blows up cars?! Oh, not now, Mum!

41:06.640 --> 41:08.600
Should I make an appointment?

41:08.640 --> 41:11.000
That wasn't just exhaust fumes.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.960
Some sort of gas, artificial gas.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And it's aliens, is it? Aliens?

41:16.040 --> 41:18.200
If it's poisonous...

41:19.680 --> 41:23.560
..then they've got poisonous gas
in every car on earth.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.240
Trigger the converters!

41:26.280 --> 41:28.640
And deadlock every single one!

41:28.680 --> 41:31.600
It's not safe.
I'll get it off the street.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.920
No, don't! Turn it off!

41:37.560 --> 41:42.400
Grandad, get out of there!
I can't! It's not locked!
It's them aliens again!

41:44.160 --> 41:47.440
What's he doing? What's he done?
They've isolated it!

41:50.000 --> 41:52.720
ALARMS BLARE

41:52.760 --> 41:56.120
PEOPLE COUGH

42:01.720 --> 42:04.360
Turn them off! Turn them off!

42:05.440 --> 42:06.920
Turn off the engines!

42:06.960 --> 42:10.200
It's all of them, sir.
Every single car on the planet!

42:14.280 --> 42:16.720
Now we begin. Let's get to work.

42:20.640 --> 42:26.200
There's gas inside the car!
He's gonna choke! Doctor!

42:27.560 --> 42:29.800
It won't open!

42:29.840 --> 42:31.640
ALARMS BLARE

42:31.680 --> 42:33.200
It's the whole world...

42:41.120 --> 42:43.760
400 million weapons!

42:43.800 --> 42:46.920
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

42:46.960 --> 42:50.680
ALL CHANT: Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

42:50.720 --> 42:54.840
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!
Sontar, ha!

42:54.880 --> 42:58.560
Sontar, ha!
Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha! Sontar, ha!

42:58.600 --> 43:01.360
COUGHING

43:01.400 --> 43:04.040
ALARMS BLARE

43:11.080 --> 43:14.480
