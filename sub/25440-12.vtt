00:40.883 --> 00:42.658
Lombard's Pass.

00:42.822 --> 00:43.939
Looks rough.

00:44.025 --> 00:47.423
But if anyone
can cross it, it's us!

00:47.565 --> 00:50.588
Although, those swaying
towers of rock at the end,

00:50.697 --> 00:54.408
ooh, could be a bit
of a challenge.

00:58.887 --> 01:03.173
So the road is a little, um,
how do I put this?

01:03.596 --> 01:05.533
- Horrifying?
- Stomach churning?

01:05.618 --> 01:06.847
Hello.

01:06.932 --> 01:10.103
We're talking about
crossing Lombard's Pass.

01:10.221 --> 01:13.187
And it's going to feel
so rewarding after we do!

01:13.272 --> 01:15.810
Besides, if we wanna stay
on the Black Rocks' path,

01:15.895 --> 01:17.244
it's our only choice.

01:17.329 --> 01:19.267
Now who's with me?

01:20.279 --> 01:23.005
That's the spirit!

01:24.483 --> 01:26.341
My telescope!

01:29.689 --> 01:32.493
That telescope was
a present from my father

01:32.578 --> 01:33.794
for this trip!

01:33.879 --> 01:35.209
Ugh! All right.

01:35.294 --> 01:37.498
Let's split up
so we find it faster.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.747
Eugene, Hook Foot,
you're with me.

01:39.832 --> 01:42.503
We'll search as long
as it takes, Princess.

01:42.588 --> 01:44.805
Even if it means we never,

01:44.890 --> 01:47.674
ever cross Lombard's Pass.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.197
Ever!

01:49.283 --> 01:51.726
You know, look,
I hate to say this, Blondie,

01:52.119 --> 01:53.557
but maybe
we should just move on.

01:53.643 --> 01:55.349
You know? The telescope
was a nice gift,

01:55.434 --> 01:58.265
but Lombard's Pass
is gonna take us hours to...

01:58.494 --> 02:01.252
And she's already
down there looking, isn't she?

02:03.701 --> 02:05.349
Thanks for
doing this, Hook Foot.

02:05.435 --> 02:08.252
That telescope is
really special to Rapunzel.

02:08.338 --> 02:09.404
Between you and me,

02:09.497 --> 02:11.119
I don't care
about the telescope.

02:11.268 --> 02:13.366
I just wanted to avoid
doing something dangerous.

02:15.110 --> 02:16.252
- Hook!
- Help!

02:16.338 --> 02:18.533
I'm too young to splat!

02:23.103 --> 02:24.424
Oh, thank you.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.267
That was close.
Are you okay?

02:26.353 --> 02:27.659
I guess
that's what I get

02:27.745 --> 02:29.697
for shining my hook
with olive oil.

02:29.782 --> 02:32.667
- - Those
chimes are so familiar.

02:32.752 --> 02:36.073
- Sounds like...
- Our day just got a whole lot worse?

02:40.346 --> 02:42.581
Eugene, look!

02:45.705 --> 02:47.080
Vigor!

02:47.284 --> 02:48.883
Madame Canardist!

02:48.968 --> 02:51.401
I am so surprised
to see you two!

02:51.487 --> 02:53.974
But we are
obviously

02:54.059 --> 02:57.411
not surprised
to see you.

02:57.721 --> 02:58.993
Of course!

02:59.078 --> 03:01.916
I mean, Vigor
is the world's most

03:02.001 --> 03:05.635
"prophetic prognosticator!"

03:06.923 --> 03:08.635
The world's most prophetic

03:08.721 --> 03:09.924
what-ca-what-icator?

03:10.010 --> 03:12.173
Get off! Get off!

03:12.258 --> 03:13.588
The old woman's
a scam artist

03:13.674 --> 03:15.385
who passes the chimp off
as some kind of psychic

03:15.470 --> 03:16.628
to bilk suckers
out of their money.

03:16.713 --> 03:19.346
Now, that's a sound
business model.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.271
When you were a child,

03:24.402 --> 03:28.057
you were much shorter.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.557
She's right!

03:29.651 --> 03:32.831
I was shorter
by one foot.

03:34.245 --> 03:36.016
We'd really love to catch up,

03:36.101 --> 03:38.119
but we're looking for...

03:38.502 --> 03:40.338
My telescope!

03:40.574 --> 03:41.607
You found it!

03:41.693 --> 03:45.111
That is absolute
kielbasa!

03:45.320 --> 03:48.120
This is my telescope.

03:50.014 --> 03:52.545
"To my love,

03:52.631 --> 03:54.749
from your father."

03:54.834 --> 03:56.570
See? This was a gift,

03:56.721 --> 03:59.065
and a reminder
of my dad.

03:59.284 --> 04:02.409
You think you are the
only person in the world

04:02.494 --> 04:05.674
is loved
by their papa?

04:05.760 --> 04:07.112
Oh, come on!

04:07.313 --> 04:10.084
You didn't even know that
inscription existed until just now!

04:10.169 --> 04:14.935
If you really want
my precious telescope,

04:15.020 --> 04:17.992
even though it would
break my heart,

04:18.077 --> 04:20.261
then you must pay for it.

04:20.346 --> 04:21.495
What? No!

04:21.581 --> 04:23.799
I am not buying back
my own telescope.

04:23.916 --> 04:25.633
Oh, that is correct.

04:25.718 --> 04:29.729
You'd be buying back
my own telescope!

04:30.903 --> 04:34.008
Fine! Take the telescope!

04:35.341 --> 04:37.178
What's that, Vigor?

04:40.212 --> 04:43.818
He says he is
very unhappy you upset me,

04:43.903 --> 04:46.086
and he is going to cast

04:46.171 --> 04:49.136
a most
malignant curse on you!

04:55.806 --> 04:57.284
Vigor says,

04:57.409 --> 05:00.267
may there be no success

05:00.495 --> 05:03.995
and no luck in your life,

05:04.081 --> 05:08.120
until the telescope
is returned to me,

05:08.237 --> 05:12.557
its proper owner!

05:14.139 --> 05:16.589
Well, it's been a real hoot
seeing you two again.

05:16.702 --> 05:18.840
Crone, primate,
I bid you adieu.

05:20.075 --> 05:23.502
You should really be
ashamed of yourselves.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.307
So, back to my height.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.295
Do you see me
ever getting taller?

05:28.381 --> 05:31.182
Vigor has spoken!

05:37.136 --> 05:39.807
I wish I knew I was gonna
have to rock climb today.

05:39.892 --> 05:41.709
I would've worn
my grappling hook.

05:41.794 --> 05:43.657
Can you believe that?

05:43.742 --> 05:45.793
And after
we helped her find Vigor

05:45.878 --> 05:47.815
when Red and Angry
monkey-napped him!

05:47.900 --> 05:50.331
Honestly! Really?
A curse?

05:50.416 --> 05:53.234
Ugh! The whole thing
is just absurd!

05:53.319 --> 05:56.370
Uh, I don't know
if I'd blow it off so quick.

05:56.455 --> 05:59.206
A few years ago,
Big Nose ticked off a shaman

05:59.291 --> 06:00.728
and got himself cursed.

06:00.813 --> 06:02.309
Really? What happened?

06:02.394 --> 06:04.164
I don't want
to get into details,

06:04.249 --> 06:05.432
but before that day,

06:05.517 --> 06:07.948
we just called him,
"Nose."

06:08.034 --> 06:09.307
- Hmm.
- Guys!

06:09.393 --> 06:11.752
There are no such thing
as curses!

06:11.837 --> 06:13.487
You know what, I agree.

06:13.572 --> 06:16.056
I don't believe in
bad luck curses, Hook Foot.

06:16.141 --> 06:18.425
The world is full of things
you can't explain.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.479
She's right.
Where does wind come from?

06:20.565 --> 06:23.205
Why are mimes so creepy? Why
is "Peggy" short for Margaret?

06:23.291 --> 06:24.299
Who knows really?

06:24.385 --> 06:25.866
But just because
you can't explain it,

06:25.951 --> 06:27.292
it doesn't mean
that it's sorcery.

06:27.409 --> 06:28.526
Precisely.

06:28.612 --> 06:30.479
Now, come on,
let's get back to camp

06:30.565 --> 06:32.800
and have a nice,
warm dinner before we...

06:33.025 --> 06:35.045
Ah! See?

06:35.131 --> 06:36.176
If I were cursed,

06:36.261 --> 06:38.417
I would have stepped
right into that mud puddle.

06:38.503 --> 06:40.552
Madame Canardist is just
trying to get into my...

06:43.202 --> 06:44.745
head.

06:48.806 --> 06:52.125
So, you really
believe that you're...

06:52.211 --> 06:53.714
cursed?

06:53.800 --> 06:54.893
Well...

06:54.979 --> 06:56.456
Oh, come on,
sweetheart.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.659
Curses aren't real.

06:57.745 --> 07:00.034
Or are they?

07:00.214 --> 07:02.737
The <i> Source
Book of Superstitions?</i>

07:02.823 --> 07:05.492
Come on! Why do we even
have this in the caravan?

07:05.577 --> 07:07.828
Ah! Here we go.

07:07.913 --> 07:10.264
"The telltale signs of a hex.

07:10.349 --> 07:12.371
Number one: weakness."

07:12.465 --> 07:13.543
Oh.

07:13.631 --> 07:15.281
I am a little bit worn out.

07:15.405 --> 07:17.279
We've been walking for hours!

07:17.412 --> 07:18.819
"Number two:

07:18.904 --> 07:20.254
cold feet."

07:20.339 --> 07:22.256
My feet are freezing!

07:22.341 --> 07:23.610
You don't wear shoes!

07:23.695 --> 07:25.917
Which brings us
to number three.

07:26.003 --> 07:27.354
"Bad luck."

07:27.513 --> 07:30.351
Princess, that's three
out of three.

07:30.436 --> 07:31.999
Which means...

07:32.084 --> 07:34.788
Which means, it's time to stop
talking about this baloney

07:34.873 --> 07:36.323
and keep moving!

07:44.019 --> 07:46.144
- Flash flood!
- Flash what?

07:48.000 --> 07:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:55.983 --> 07:56.999
I'm sorry,

07:57.085 --> 07:59.810
but this just
screams curse.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.511
Look, I get why you think
you're cursed, Blondie.

08:05.597 --> 08:06.597
I... I do.

08:06.683 --> 08:08.265
When strange things
happen to us,

08:08.351 --> 08:09.641
we want to believe
it's for a reason.

08:09.726 --> 08:11.125
But remember what you said

08:11.210 --> 08:12.814
about making your own luck?

08:15.527 --> 08:17.231
The best way
to predict the future

08:17.316 --> 08:18.465
is to create your own.

08:18.550 --> 08:20.989
Maybe you're right.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.450
Eugene, look!

08:23.535 --> 08:24.785
The river receded!

08:24.870 --> 08:27.241
We can cross
it in the morning!

08:27.326 --> 08:28.372
See?

08:28.458 --> 08:30.057
Bad luck,
shmad luck!

08:30.142 --> 08:32.860
I guess I was
being kind of silly.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.149
Well, I mean,
I didn't wanna say it,

08:35.234 --> 08:37.251
but yeah, "silly"
is the right word.

08:37.336 --> 08:38.565
"Kooky" works, too.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.254
Or "completely ludicrous."

08:41.886 --> 08:43.756
Eugene?

08:43.842 --> 08:46.226
This is still a coincidence!

08:47.426 --> 08:49.496
Aah! Something
just touched me!

08:49.581 --> 08:50.844
Excuse me.

08:50.929 --> 08:53.333
No street clothes
in the swimming pool.

08:53.418 --> 08:54.564
Rude.

08:58.837 --> 09:00.628
Psst!

09:01.606 --> 09:03.010
I know what to do.

09:03.095 --> 09:06.326
- Hook Foot?
- Uh, maybe.

09:06.621 --> 09:09.016
Meet me under
the full moon tonight,

09:09.101 --> 09:11.118
at midnight.

09:11.203 --> 09:14.334
Tell no one.

09:14.419 --> 09:16.403
Why not?

09:16.488 --> 09:20.809
Because it sounds
more dramatic this way.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.364
Ooh! So like I said,

09:24.449 --> 09:26.871
this ritual
guarantees to counter

09:26.957 --> 09:29.512
the darkest hexes
and curses imaginable.

09:29.598 --> 09:32.439
I will do anything
to end this curse.

09:32.637 --> 09:35.636
Hold this. Let me
get the ingredients.

09:36.895 --> 09:38.412
One tuft of bat fur,

09:38.497 --> 09:39.960
a blind beetle,

09:40.045 --> 09:41.782
three toenail clippings,

09:41.867 --> 09:44.064
a sprinkling
of oregano,

09:44.149 --> 09:45.586
and last but not least,

09:45.733 --> 09:47.170
a weasel tooth.

09:47.786 --> 09:49.210
And you'll need this!

09:49.821 --> 09:51.758
Even got one for you,
little guy.

09:51.843 --> 09:53.373
Okay, step two:

09:53.458 --> 09:56.497
we gotta walk counter-clockwise
around the cauldron

09:56.582 --> 09:59.433
while the cursed soul
reads the mystical spell.

09:59.518 --> 10:01.923
"Spirits on high..."

10:04.036 --> 10:06.427
"heed this verse,"

10:07.639 --> 10:09.676
"obey my command,

10:09.761 --> 10:12.259
and lift this curse"?

10:12.344 --> 10:13.480
You're not selling it!

10:13.565 --> 10:15.182
You gotta say it
with feeling.

10:15.267 --> 10:16.497
I thought you said

10:16.582 --> 10:18.619
"we" were performing
this spell.

10:18.704 --> 10:21.355
I ain't
the one who's cursed!

10:23.155 --> 10:25.125
"Banish this pain,

10:25.210 --> 10:27.749
"banish this sorrow...

10:28.660 --> 10:30.511
"remove this curse,

10:30.596 --> 10:32.312
"or know no tomorrow!

10:32.397 --> 10:34.368
"By the winds
of the west,

10:34.453 --> 10:36.537
"the flames from the east,

10:36.622 --> 10:38.819
"crush this hex,

10:38.904 --> 10:41.041
"slay this beast!"

10:42.348 --> 10:44.766
Maybe a little
less feeling?

10:52.851 --> 10:55.343
Psst! Rapunzel?

10:56.588 --> 10:57.604
Rapunzel?

10:57.689 --> 10:59.225
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

10:59.311 --> 11:00.865
Intruder!

11:00.951 --> 11:04.637
Oof! Ow! No!
Hey! Ow! Ow! Why?!

11:07.654 --> 11:09.163
What are you doing?

11:09.303 --> 11:11.838
Well, I was
just looking for a blanket,

11:11.923 --> 11:13.407
but now my bigger concern

11:13.492 --> 11:15.242
is trying to find
my spleen!

11:15.327 --> 11:17.678
Oh, there it is,
over by my dignity.

11:17.763 --> 11:20.047
Wait, is that
a horseshoe?

11:20.132 --> 11:21.528
Uh...

11:21.613 --> 11:22.896
You know, it's bad enough

11:22.981 --> 11:24.851
this caravan is covered
in garlic and incense,

11:24.936 --> 11:26.670
but now
you're in on it too?

11:26.772 --> 11:30.584
Rapunzel, this curse nonsense
needs to end right no...

11:31.481 --> 11:32.847
Cassandra?

11:33.550 --> 11:35.087
Where is Rapunzel?

11:36.295 --> 11:37.598
"Bad luck curse,

11:37.683 --> 11:39.756
"you're nothing but trouble,

11:39.842 --> 11:41.654
"but after this chant,

11:41.740 --> 11:44.184
you'll be squashed
on the double!"

11:44.287 --> 11:46.733
Throw in that
weasel tooth!

12:25.179 --> 12:26.647
Where is it?

12:26.732 --> 12:28.870
It couldn't
just disappear.

12:33.618 --> 12:34.718
Oh, boy.

12:41.562 --> 12:43.660
Oy vey.

12:47.003 --> 12:48.605
You guys
might wanna get

12:48.691 --> 12:50.488
a different recipe
for spinach soup.

12:50.574 --> 12:52.956
Well, it was supposed
to be a counter-curse.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.417
It's no use, Hook Foot.

12:55.503 --> 12:57.652
There's only
one thing left to do.

12:57.761 --> 13:00.792
Return the telescope to Madame
Canardist in the morning

13:00.894 --> 13:03.558
and put an end
to this curse.

13:03.643 --> 13:06.089
But that telescope
is really important to you.

13:06.175 --> 13:07.433
Eugene, my man,

13:07.527 --> 13:08.808
if the lady
wants to return it,

13:08.894 --> 13:09.965
let her return it.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.105
Yeah, we'll pitch in
and get her a new one,

13:12.191 --> 13:15.261
a better one,
one with more glass.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.800
I'll take it back
first thing in the morning

13:18.897 --> 13:21.315
if I can even make it
through the night.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.589
Aw, look!

13:22.675 --> 13:23.998
A family
of black cats!

13:34.974 --> 13:36.800
Wait, uh, Blondie!

13:36.886 --> 13:39.857
Look, I know I said this
whole curse thing is silly,

13:39.980 --> 13:41.810
but then
I remembered something.

13:41.981 --> 13:43.926
And I don't know why
I didn't think of this before.

13:44.011 --> 13:46.829
It's an old tooth I found
during an adventure once,

13:46.915 --> 13:50.401
and I don't know, I just had
a "good feeling" about it.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.128
What? I can't believe it.

13:53.214 --> 13:56.632
Mr. Anti-superstition
has a good luck charm?

13:56.718 --> 13:58.660
I never really
thought of it that way.

13:58.746 --> 14:01.035
I just held onto it because
it made a cool trinket.

14:01.121 --> 14:03.251
But then I saw this:

14:03.456 --> 14:06.541
"The moose tooth
is one of the most powerful

14:06.626 --> 14:09.035
"counter-curse
charms in the world,

14:09.121 --> 14:10.316
"warding off evil,

14:10.402 --> 14:13.720
and inviting positive
forces of the universe."

14:15.597 --> 14:16.713
No!

14:16.814 --> 14:17.917
That thing?

14:18.003 --> 14:19.058
You're kidding, right?

14:19.144 --> 14:20.175
Is this a joke?

14:20.261 --> 14:23.527
Of course it's a joke.
Ha-ha-ha, good one.

14:24.574 --> 14:25.738
Is it a joke?

14:25.824 --> 14:27.274
I'm still unclear.

14:27.396 --> 14:29.449
Hey, you read it
for yourself, Blondie.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.605
I'm just the messenger here.

14:32.190 --> 14:33.240
Eugene!

14:33.326 --> 14:34.605
This is incredible!

14:34.691 --> 14:36.775
I mean, I do kind of
feel bad for the moose,

14:36.861 --> 14:39.160
but hopefully all the
rest of his teeth are intact,

14:39.246 --> 14:41.008
and he's also
got antlers, so...

14:41.094 --> 14:42.980
Sunshine. Hi. Focus.

14:43.127 --> 14:44.847
Right. Sorry.

14:44.978 --> 14:46.550
Do you think it'll work?

14:46.698 --> 14:48.469
I really do.

14:54.254 --> 14:55.520
Hiyah!

15:22.248 --> 15:25.220
Of all the Deadly Bridges
of Swaying Rocks I've seen,

15:25.305 --> 15:26.815
this is the deadliest!

15:26.901 --> 15:28.738
But only the second
swayey-est.

15:28.953 --> 15:30.206
Don't worry, guys.

15:30.322 --> 15:33.979
We've closed
the door on disaster.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.258
Get ready.

16:10.422 --> 16:12.155
Now!

16:17.537 --> 16:18.553
Yes!

16:18.638 --> 16:21.589
That was impeccable timing!

16:21.783 --> 16:24.564
Didn't see the moose tooth
coming, did ya, curse?

16:24.824 --> 16:26.127
Mwah!

16:26.455 --> 16:27.635
Moose tooth?

16:27.785 --> 16:29.900
More like my's tooth!

16:30.091 --> 16:31.822
Welcome back, Edna.

16:32.010 --> 16:35.169
I kept your room
just like you left it.

16:35.936 --> 16:38.439
What is going on here?

16:38.611 --> 16:40.713
Ha! What are the odds.

16:40.816 --> 16:43.681
Shorty has the same
size teeth as a moose?

16:43.767 --> 16:45.476
I never, ever
would've guessed that.

16:45.562 --> 16:48.697
Eugene! That wasn't
a good luck charm, was it?

16:48.783 --> 16:50.510
That was just Shorty's tooth.

16:50.596 --> 16:53.611
Ugh! And I kissed it, ew.

16:53.697 --> 16:56.022
What are we gonna do now?

17:04.031 --> 17:05.901
You lied to me, Eugene!

17:05.987 --> 17:08.318
You said that was
a lucky moose tooth!

17:08.404 --> 17:09.571
Now, just a second, Blondie.

17:09.657 --> 17:10.704
I didn't lie.

17:10.790 --> 17:13.002
I simply relayed
select truths.

17:13.089 --> 17:15.011
What are you
talking about?!

17:15.097 --> 17:17.847
Well, I did find the tooth
on an adventure.

17:17.933 --> 17:20.121
This adventure
to be exact.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.598
<i>After taking the book,</i>

17:24.684 --> 17:27.824
<i>I stumbled upon the section
of anti-curse charms,</i>

17:27.910 --> 17:29.980
<i>and saw the
moose tooth passage.</i>

17:30.496 --> 17:33.292
<i>From there, I just
kind of rolled with it.</i>

17:34.267 --> 17:35.870
I mean, how was
I supposed to know

17:35.956 --> 17:37.191
it was Shorty's tooth?

17:37.277 --> 17:39.746
Okay, lie or "select truths,"

17:39.832 --> 17:41.581
we're mere inches
away from our doom,

17:41.667 --> 17:43.504
so can we please
focus on that, people?

17:43.590 --> 17:45.787
I... I can't!

17:45.882 --> 17:46.965
The curse!

17:53.948 --> 17:56.292
Rapunzel, look at me.
Think about it.

17:56.412 --> 17:57.823
Bad things
only started to happen

17:57.909 --> 17:59.073
once you thought
you were cursed.

17:59.158 --> 18:00.223
And good things
started to happen

18:00.308 --> 18:02.503
once you thought you found
the counter-curse.

18:02.718 --> 18:03.967
Look, someone
once told me

18:04.053 --> 18:06.362
that they don't believe
in bad luck curses.

18:06.745 --> 18:08.987
And someone
once told me

18:09.073 --> 18:11.010
that the best way
to predict the future

18:11.096 --> 18:12.691
is to create your own.

18:12.777 --> 18:15.759
Did I say that? Wow.
That is very poetic.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.409
- I didn't...
- My luck is no worse

18:18.511 --> 18:20.448
or no better
than anyone else's.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.866
What matters is what
I choose to focus on.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.300
And I'm choosing the fact
that we've almost made it

18:26.386 --> 18:28.495
across this bridge
without a scrape,

18:28.581 --> 18:30.912
and there's no reason
to stop now!

18:30.998 --> 18:32.167
That's right, Princess!

18:32.253 --> 18:33.800
Show that bridge
who's boss!

18:33.886 --> 18:35.353
Yeah! You got this, Raps!

18:35.439 --> 18:36.581
Tap into that optimism!

18:36.667 --> 18:38.479
Ain't that the "tooth."

18:38.681 --> 18:40.284
Good one, Shorty.

18:42.448 --> 18:43.604
All right, guys.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.800
Drop your heads,

18:44.886 --> 18:46.612
and engage your hocks!

18:59.065 --> 19:01.249
Yes! That's the Raps I know!

19:01.334 --> 19:03.034
Just two more towers to go.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.472
e're gonna
need a lot of momentum

19:04.557 --> 19:07.108
to make it across both of
them to the other side!

19:07.193 --> 19:09.865
Then let's make a run for it!

19:18.290 --> 19:20.376
Oh no! Oh no!

19:21.202 --> 19:24.486
The curse has scrambled her brain!

19:27.320 --> 19:29.120
e've got to
get to the other side!

19:29.254 --> 19:30.217
Oh, sure!

19:30.318 --> 19:32.022
Maybe we'll just
all just flap our arms

19:32.108 --> 19:33.545
and we'll fly across!

19:34.202 --> 19:35.852
Fly across.

19:36.116 --> 19:38.976
Hook Foot, do you still have all
the counter-curse ingredients?

19:39.109 --> 19:41.160
Everything
except a weasel tooth.

19:41.561 --> 19:42.936
Shorty?

19:43.022 --> 19:45.608
I'm gonna need
to borrow Edna again.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.674
Gang, hold on tight!

19:53.767 --> 19:56.194
It's time for takeoff!

19:57.616 --> 19:59.116
Get ready!

20:02.762 --> 20:03.861
Now!

20:26.696 --> 20:27.845
Yes!

20:27.931 --> 20:30.514
Blondie, that idea
was genius!

20:30.600 --> 20:31.797
You saved us!

20:31.883 --> 20:33.290
Yeah. Come on.

20:33.412 --> 20:34.821
No big deal.

20:34.907 --> 20:37.346
It's not like I was
cursed or anything.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.737
Max and Fidella
are gonna need those.

20:43.835 --> 20:46.948
We've still got a
long journey ahead of us.

20:47.182 --> 20:49.557
Thank you for encouraging me.

20:49.642 --> 20:52.260
I guess, I was
just looking at things

20:52.346 --> 20:54.307
through the wrong end
of the telescope.

20:54.416 --> 20:56.238
Pun intended.

20:57.262 --> 20:59.165
From now on, no hexes,

20:59.297 --> 21:02.462
no trinkets,
no "select truths."

21:02.548 --> 21:05.397
Together,
we make our own luck!

21:08.639 --> 21:10.920
Well, it's like
I said all along,

21:11.006 --> 21:12.600
there's no such thing
as curses.

21:12.685 --> 21:13.725
Ow!

21:16.435 --> 21:17.872
This is perfectly normal!

21:23.568 --> 21:25.692
Aah! Vigor?

21:25.778 --> 21:27.943
How in the monkey's uncle
did you get over...

21:30.501 --> 21:32.865
Why do keep
looking at me like that?!

21:32.966 --> 21:34.737
Vigor!

21:36.022 --> 21:38.614
We go now.

21:39.657 --> 21:41.904
What is that
monkey's problem?

21:42.060 --> 21:44.474
Why don't you
go climb... Ow!

21:44.797 --> 21:46.722
Who put this here?!

21:48.868 --> 21:50.638
Eugene, are you coming?

21:50.723 --> 21:52.761
Be right there, Sunshine.

21:55.575 --> 21:57.522
Eh, never can
be too careful.
