Oh, my God.

What's he doing?

00:50.588 --> 00:52.022
Who is that?

00:53.842 --> 00:56.093
Maybe it's the Park Service.

01:02.183 --> 01:04.184
It was no one.

01:05.904 --> 01:08.438
Or was it the Iron Claw
killer?

01:08.523 --> 01:10.524
It's not funny.

You're listening
to your classic rock station

01:46.978 --> 01:48.896
in the Bay.

01:48.947 --> 01:52.232
In the end, I just write
about violent crime.

01:52.283 --> 01:54.985
The real heroes are
the people here beside me.

01:55.069 --> 01:57.654
Now give a warm welcome
to our next speaker,

01:57.739 --> 02:00.273
Dr. Spencer Reid of the BAU.

02:03.828 --> 02:05.329
Thank you. Thanks.

02:05.413 --> 02:07.631
Patricia Cornwell,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:07.715 --> 02:11.218
Ms. Cornwell will be signing books
at the end of the session.

02:12.420 --> 02:13.837
Sorry. Um...

02:13.922 --> 02:16.340
Hi. I am here today

02:16.424 --> 02:19.509
to talk to you
about paraphilias

02:19.594 --> 02:22.779
and their relation
to violent crime.

02:25.767 --> 02:29.970
Does anybody know
what dendrophilia is?

02:32.190 --> 02:36.476
Yes, a fetish for trees.

02:39.747 --> 02:42.699
Thank you so much
for coming out, you guys,

02:42.784 --> 02:45.369
and as for your
question earlier,

02:45.453 --> 02:47.371
the case that we were
following at the time

02:47.455 --> 02:49.373
was the David Parker ray
case.

02:49.457 --> 02:52.793
We actually believed that the
victim count in that case

02:52.844 --> 02:54.595
was close to 60.
Unfortunately,

02:54.662 --> 02:57.047
we were only able
to unearth 45 bodies,

02:57.131 --> 02:58.966
but SSA Buffalino, um,

02:59.017 --> 03:00.467
has been diligent...

03:02.637 --> 03:04.170
Dr. Reid?

03:04.222 --> 03:07.024
Hey, you were fantastic
up there.

03:07.108 --> 03:08.174
Thank you.

03:08.226 --> 03:10.510
Yeah. I love the names
of those paraphilias.

03:10.561 --> 03:12.362
I have a new list
to memorize.

03:12.447 --> 03:13.597
You like memorizing lists?

03:13.665 --> 03:15.032
I'm weird that way.

03:15.116 --> 03:16.683
That's not weird at all.
I do it all the time.

03:16.734 --> 03:18.785
You know, we don't usually
get people your age here.

03:18.853 --> 03:20.186
You're in school,
I assume?

03:20.238 --> 03:21.538
Yeah, I'm a senior
at Michigan.

03:21.623 --> 03:22.856
You know what?
You might like

03:22.907 --> 03:24.458
the FBI's
internship program.

03:24.525 --> 03:26.526
Unfortunately, we're already
past the deadline,

03:26.577 --> 03:27.794
but if you write me
a letter,

03:27.862 --> 03:30.130
I might be able
to pull some strings.

03:30.197 --> 03:31.882
Uh...Thanks.

03:31.966 --> 03:35.953
But I don't think my
Board of Directors would allow it.

03:36.020 --> 03:39.222
I have a company.
Have you heard of Nanovex?

03:39.307 --> 03:41.708
Nanovex, as in the company
Landis Pharmaceuticals

03:41.759 --> 03:44.311
investing 100 million
dollars in, Nanovex?

03:44.378 --> 03:46.713
It's not a done deal yet.

03:46.764 --> 03:48.932
Uh, but, hey, you were
awesome up there.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.769
You saved me from a
company party downstairs

03:50.794 --> 03:52.288
that was a total snoozefest.

03:52.937 --> 03:54.287
Keep up the good work.

03:54.355 --> 03:56.640
You, too.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.308
Who was that?

03:58.376 --> 03:59.977
That was the founder
of Nanovex.

04:00.044 --> 04:01.495
I've never heard of it.

04:01.562 --> 04:03.163
They make magnetically
responsive nanoparticles

04:03.230 --> 04:05.382
for targeted drug
delivery to tumor cells.

04:05.450 --> 04:07.150
I've still never
heard of it.

04:07.218 --> 04:10.203
You will. It's gonna
change the world.

04:14.559 --> 04:15.492
Guess who's back.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.827
The Marin headlands
last night.

04:16.894 --> 04:20.514
David Atley and Nicole Puli,
both 24, both grad students

04:20.581 --> 04:21.630
at Berkeley,
shot multiple times

04:21.716 --> 04:25.135
in their vehicle--
wait for it--

04:25.219 --> 04:26.319
The Zodiac?

04:26.387 --> 04:28.188
No way.

04:28.255 --> 04:29.690
Come on, it's gotta be
the 2.0 version.

04:29.757 --> 04:30.957
Yeah, you would think so,

04:31.025 --> 04:33.443
except for the crazy
similarities in the M.O.

04:33.528 --> 04:35.012
I'm talking same victimology,

04:35.079 --> 04:36.847
same geography.

04:36.914 --> 04:39.683
And two souvenirs were
left at the crime scene.

04:39.751 --> 04:41.201
He left a photo?

04:41.268 --> 04:43.787
Mm-hmm. Local police say
that is Marcia Miller.

04:43.871 --> 04:46.823
She was found near Napa
in 1971.

04:46.908 --> 04:49.159
Strongly suspected that she was
a victim of the Zodiac,

04:49.243 --> 04:50.627
but police never
confirmed it

04:50.712 --> 04:52.529
and they didn't
publicize the case.

04:52.597 --> 04:53.947
So the Zodiac
took this photo

04:53.998 --> 04:56.016
at the killing and then saved it
all these years?

04:56.084 --> 04:58.335
The Zodiac's
last confirmed victim

04:58.419 --> 05:00.387
was the cabdriver
Paul Stine.

05:00.454 --> 05:02.889
He mailed pieces
of Stine's bloody shirt

05:02.957 --> 05:05.192
along with his letters
to prove it was him.

05:05.259 --> 05:07.644
This photo could prove
he's back.

05:07.729 --> 05:10.647
Oh...You just mentioned
a bloody shirt?

05:10.732 --> 05:12.803
This is the second
souvenir that was left

05:12.828 --> 05:14.028
at the crime scene.

05:14.068 --> 05:17.487
Preliminary tests say that
the blood type is O-negative.

05:17.572 --> 05:19.823
Same blood type
as the cabdriver.

05:19.907 --> 05:22.325
So how old would
Zodiac be by now?

05:22.410 --> 05:24.394
The murders took place
in the late sixties?

05:24.462 --> 05:29.232
Yeah. Uh, December 20, 1968,
to October 11, 1969,

05:29.300 --> 05:31.168
to be exact, but he was suspected
of other crimes,

05:31.252 --> 05:35.488
and he sent letters and codes
to newspapers until 1974.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.091
Well, at the very least, the Zodiac
would have to be about 60 by now.

05:38.159 --> 05:40.994
But it doesn't take a lot of
strength to pull a trigger.

05:41.045 --> 05:42.345
No, but it takes
a lot of skill

05:42.430 --> 05:43.864
not to get caught
for 40 years.

05:43.931 --> 05:46.166
Have Reid and Prentiss
meet us in San Francisco.

05:46.217 --> 05:47.551
Yes, sir.

Benjamin Franklin.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.304
Bottom line is Zodiac
is the most well-documented

07:01.389 --> 07:05.442
unsolved serial killing case
in modern times.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.027
There have been
two known copycats.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.429
Correct. The first one
was Heriberto Seda.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.482
He killed 3 and wounded 4
in New York City.

07:12.550 --> 07:15.485
And then there was
a 14-year-old in Japan

07:15.569 --> 07:17.437
named Saito Sakakibara.

07:17.488 --> 07:19.039
He killed two other children

07:19.106 --> 07:20.523
and left the sign
of the Zodiac behind.

07:20.591 --> 07:23.343
The fact is, the Zodiac
was driven by a need

07:23.411 --> 07:24.610
for notoriety and control.

07:24.662 --> 07:26.863
He enjoyed the terror
he spread through the city.

07:26.931 --> 07:28.214
Well, then he stopped.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.167
After his last letter
in '74, he vanished.

07:31.235 --> 07:33.837
Most likely wound up in
a prison or a mental hospital.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.505
Maybe he was just released

07:35.589 --> 07:37.173
and picked up
where he left off.

07:37.258 --> 07:39.426
I will search for anyone
recently freed or discharged

07:39.477 --> 07:40.844
after 40 years.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.730
It's a long time to be dormant
with no evolution in the M.O.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.848
Agreed.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.100
Even a serial killer
has to grow up.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.368
Hmm.
Check.

08:08.089 --> 08:09.422
Check.

08:19.984 --> 08:22.435
Checkmate.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.426
Hey, Caleb, what the hell?

08:29.493 --> 08:30.660
Break time's over.

08:48.879 --> 08:50.863
- It's Harvey.
- Leave a message.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.536
Yes.
Agent Hotchner?

08:56.587 --> 08:57.720
Nice to meet you.
I'm Agent Lin.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.622
This is Agent Jareau.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.641
We're setting you up
in the city field office.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.144
All the Zodiac data has been
sent over from local P.D.s.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.279
Good. That avoids
jurisdiction issues.

09:06.347 --> 09:08.421
According to the M.E.,
David Atley was shot

09:08.446 --> 09:09.599
twice in the head.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.570
Nicole Puli was shot 13 times
in the face, torso, and back.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.088
Weapon was a 9-millimeter.

09:15.156 --> 09:16.489
Overkill on the female.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.324
The Zodiac
did the same thing.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.577
He also used a 9-millimeter.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.163
We're examining ballistics
for a match.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.682
Take look over here.

09:25.749 --> 09:29.352
We I.D.'D these as military
Wing-Walker boots.

09:29.420 --> 09:31.838
Huh. Let me guess.
Size 10 1/2.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.492
Just like the prints
found at Lake Berryessa in '69.

09:35.559 --> 09:39.596
What makes you think this
is the real Zodiac, Agent?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.831
The M.O. is uncannily similar.

09:41.899 --> 09:45.418
If it's not him, then
it's an equally evil twin.

09:45.469 --> 09:47.437
Or someone who's studied
him meticulously.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.772
Have any letters
or ciphers been received?

09:49.857 --> 09:51.441
Agent Lin, this is Dr. Reid,
Agent Prentiss.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.059
How was
the conference?

09:53.110 --> 09:54.110
Enlightening.

09:54.195 --> 09:55.812
Has the unsub
made any contact?

09:55.880 --> 09:57.442
The "Chronicle's"
website manager received

09:57.467 --> 09:58.867
two phone calls this morning.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.984
There was just heavy
breathing on the other end.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.369
Like the phone calls
Zodiac used to make.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.759
Can I get a physical copy
of the online version

10:05.784 --> 10:06.984
of today's paper?

10:07.041 --> 10:08.675
You want a printout
of the online version?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.242
Yeah. With all the comments
printed out as well,

10:10.267 --> 10:11.467
if possible, thanks.

10:12.096 --> 10:13.263
Don't ask.

10:15.216 --> 10:17.967
It's not the real Zodiac.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.802
How can you be so sure?

10:19.887 --> 10:21.554
I just know it.

10:23.774 --> 10:25.842
Sometimes I can't
really explain it.

10:27.678 --> 10:30.396
He hasn't had
a visitor in ages.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.398
He used to get so many

10:32.466 --> 10:34.984
when he was with
the Napa P.D.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.969
Bob?

10:37.021 --> 10:40.490
These people
are from the FBI.

10:40.574 --> 10:41.491
Hello, Detective.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.810
We're Agents Rossi
and Morgan.

10:44.862 --> 10:46.646
He has Parkinson's.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.249
This is one of
the bad days.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.816
Well, ma'am, maybe
you could help us out.

10:50.868 --> 10:52.252
It won't take very long.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.753
This is about
the Zodiac, isn't it?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.004
I've been watching
the news.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.023
Did Bob ever talk
about his work?

10:57.091 --> 10:59.542
That's all he talked about.

10:59.627 --> 11:01.511
I tried to move
his old boxes out,

11:01.595 --> 11:05.214
but he got so agitated,
I had to bring them back.

11:05.299 --> 11:06.950
Do you mind
if we take a look?

11:07.017 --> 11:08.518
Help yourself.
Excuse me,

11:08.602 --> 11:11.487
I have to get
his medication.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.858
Wow, she wasn't kidding
when she said

11:15.943 --> 11:18.027
he liked to surround himself
with his work.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.947
These are all about
Marcia Miller,

11:21.014 --> 11:23.066
who died in '71

11:23.150 --> 11:26.119
and possibly killed by Zodiac.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.778
Rossi, these are
crime scene photos.

11:28.803 --> 11:30.003
Take a look at this.

11:30.291 --> 11:34.577
Marcia Miller's photo
could have come from this batch.

11:34.662 --> 11:37.213
You know, a guy
this obsessed with work

11:37.298 --> 11:39.899
probably used his own camera.

11:44.838 --> 11:49.892
Detective, did you take
these pictures yourself

11:49.977 --> 11:51.110
at the crime scene?

11:51.178 --> 11:53.730
Now, you can blink
once for yes

11:53.814 --> 11:55.598
and twice for no.

11:55.683 --> 11:57.600
Did you take these?

12:00.204 --> 12:01.688
Sir, is it possible

12:01.739 --> 12:04.340
that someone could have
come in here and stolen one?

12:06.994 --> 12:08.478
Do you know who?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.169
Mrs. Zablonsky,
you said your husband

12:16.236 --> 12:17.987
used to get
a lot of visitors?

12:18.055 --> 12:22.458
Oh, yes. They were all people
obsessed with the Zodiac.

12:22.543 --> 12:25.795
Well, do you think
you can write down the names

12:25.879 --> 12:27.547
of all those
that you remember?

12:27.598 --> 12:28.681
Oh.

12:29.933 --> 12:31.484
The dates match.

12:31.552 --> 12:33.036
When Zodiac stopped killing,

12:33.103 --> 12:35.171
my cousin was put in
a mental hospital in Mexico.

12:35.239 --> 12:37.140
He was released
2 months ago.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.991
Do you have anything
more specific?

12:39.059 --> 12:42.478
He was working on a production
of "The Mikado" in '68.

12:42.563 --> 12:45.114
The Zodiac talked about
"The Mikado" in a letter.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.867
Excuse me. I'm Dr. Reid with
the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.952
Was your cousin by chance
a fan of Wagner?

12:50.037 --> 12:52.171
Because a Cd
of the "Tragic Overture"

12:52.239 --> 12:53.740
was sent to the police
this morning.

12:53.791 --> 12:56.709
He loved Wagner, especially
the "Tragic Overture." It's him.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.277
Oh, yeah.
Well, for the record,

12:58.328 --> 12:59.962
a CD was not sent
to the police this morning,

13:00.047 --> 13:02.498
and the "Tragic Overture"
was written by Brahms, not Wagner,

13:02.583 --> 13:04.667
so luckily, I guess
it's not your cousin.

13:04.752 --> 13:07.003
The FBI would greatly
appreciate it if people

13:07.087 --> 13:09.472
would stop making false claims
to get their 15 minutes of fame.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.807
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.142
Well, this is quite
a surprise development

13:13.227 --> 13:16.179
we just witnessed outside
the San Francisco FBI building.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.015
We'll have more for you later.
Reporting live for Action News,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.150
back to you in the studio.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.536
The best news is that when Harvey
goes on his honeymoon,

13:23.604 --> 13:26.522
the rest of us will get two weeks of
not looking so stupid at work.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.860
Seriously, it's a real honor
to be your best man.

13:30.928 --> 13:32.662
You and Marisa are perfect
for each other,

13:32.746 --> 13:35.515
and I wish you
all the happiness in the world.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.316
Congrats. Enjoy the party.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.317
Cheers.

13:45.259 --> 13:48.511
Excuse me.
I'd like to say something.

13:48.595 --> 13:52.582
If I could direct your
attention to the screen.

13:52.649 --> 13:54.400
So that's me.

13:54.468 --> 13:55.701
Caleb Rossmore.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.336
If you think
I was funny-looking,

13:57.387 --> 13:59.222
you should have seen Harvey.

14:00.741 --> 14:03.693
I met Harvey at the finals

14:03.777 --> 14:06.529
of the class "A" regional
chess tournament.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.563
I annihilated him.

14:07.648 --> 14:11.417
But he still became
my best friend.

14:11.485 --> 14:14.737
I finally found someone else
who was a child prodigy

14:14.822 --> 14:17.907
and a playground
punching bag, too.

14:17.991 --> 14:21.527
We became inseparable because
of our shared love of Chess.

14:21.578 --> 14:23.796
And some other weird stuff,
right, Harv?

14:26.250 --> 14:29.702
We liked animal dissection
and Roman history

14:29.753 --> 14:31.270
and crime journalism--

14:31.338 --> 14:32.421
Thank you.
Thank you, Caleb--

14:32.506 --> 14:33.539
Almost finished.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.647
I didn't see Harvey as much
after high school,

14:41.715 --> 14:44.100
but we always had
a special connection.

14:44.184 --> 14:47.069
I thought I knew him so well.

14:47.154 --> 14:50.807
But I was completely shocked
when I found out

14:50.874 --> 14:53.659
he was engaged to Marisa.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.078
Mainly because
I couldn't believe the hot chick

14:56.163 --> 14:57.647
we both had
a crush on in Junior High

14:57.714 --> 14:59.866
actually said yes to him.

15:01.285 --> 15:03.068
Anyway, buddy,
I'll wrap it up.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.209
Your soul mate is standing
before you now.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.668
In the words of Plautus,

15:18.735 --> 15:21.737
let us celebrate
with wine and sweet words.

15:22.756 --> 15:26.325
That was so sweet.
I almost cried.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.328
Thanks, man.
Listen, uh,

15:29.396 --> 15:32.365
I'm sorry I've been
such a deadbeat friend.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.433
I owe you a call.

15:34.484 --> 15:37.436
Yeah, I'm getting
used to the radio silence.

15:37.487 --> 15:38.855
I'm sorry.

15:38.922 --> 15:42.375
I have something for you.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.627
I know it's normally
the best man's job,

15:44.711 --> 15:47.246
but I asked
if I could do it.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.968
A ticket to Vegas.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.136
For your bachelor party
weekend.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.239
I'm picking you up
tomorrow at 6:00.

15:56.306 --> 15:58.391
Wow. Thanks, man,
but I...

15:58.458 --> 16:00.409
I can't do
a whole weekend.

16:00.477 --> 16:04.413
I just have too much work.
I thought it was one night.

16:04.481 --> 16:06.899
Harvey, you have to go.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.720
You're only getting
married once.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.657
Yes, ma'am.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.659
Terrific.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.416
The detective's wife
couldn't remember many names.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.002
That's all right. We'll show her
photos when we have a suspect.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.344
I talked to
Nicole Puli's mother.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.846
It doesn't seem
she was stalked.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.100
Lab results are back
on the piece of fabric.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.235
The DNA doesn't match
the original cabdriver.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.022
And the cloth
is fairly new.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.857
It was distressed
to look old.

16:47.941 --> 16:51.444
Guess I was foolish to think
it was the real Zodiac.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.696
Well, he went to great pains
to make us think it was him.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.198
And he was criminally
sophisticated enough to pull it off.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.034
The question is why.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.454
Reid,
how's it going?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.122
Computers slow me down,
so I prefer paper,

17:03.189 --> 17:04.640
but I wasn't expecting
all these comments.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.626
Where do people find the time?

17:10.047 --> 17:12.647
I think I just found
a cipher from the unsub.

17:12.715 --> 17:15.134
The symbols buried
in the spam are the same ones

17:15.202 --> 17:17.803
the Zodiac used in his
first message back in 1969.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.138
What does it say?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.313
"Killing is the most fun
you can have 98 minutes

17:22.338 --> 17:23.944
below the horizon
in magic city

17:23.944 --> 17:25.915
with President Garfield.
Happy hunting."

17:29.382 --> 17:31.484
The oracle is in.
How may I assist?

17:31.551 --> 17:34.704
Garcia, to what specific location
does magic city refer?

17:35.822 --> 17:36.906
Birmingham, Alabama.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.024
98 minutes below the horizon.

17:38.075 --> 17:39.325
Garcia, what time is sunset
there, tonight?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.576
6:22.

17:40.661 --> 17:42.028
98 minutes there
would be 8 p.m.

17:42.079 --> 17:44.163
What's dedicated to President Garfield
in San Francisco?

17:44.230 --> 17:47.283
President Garfield...

17:47.367 --> 17:50.486
There's a statue of him
in Golden Gate Park.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.425
No one
at the south entrance yet.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.544
Copy that.

18:12.109 --> 18:13.258
We've got a vehicle.

18:18.899 --> 18:20.432
It's a lone driver.

18:27.908 --> 18:28.908
Move in.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.635
FBI. Show me your hands.

18:42.472 --> 18:44.757
Drop it.

18:44.808 --> 18:46.842
I'm just the messenger.

18:46.927 --> 18:49.979
I'm supposed to
deliver a letter.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.764
It's for Reid.

18:58.772 --> 19:01.657
"You're not as smart
as you think you are."

19:01.742 --> 19:02.658
Who sent it?

19:02.743 --> 19:04.026
I don't know.

19:04.111 --> 19:06.145
I just deliver it to the address
when I'm supposed to.

19:06.196 --> 19:09.949
If the unsub's not here,
where is he?

19:17.624 --> 19:19.208
Please, take the money.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.326
Ohh...
Do it.

19:21.378 --> 19:23.662
Please.

19:23.713 --> 19:25.464
Please don't hurt us,
please.

19:25.515 --> 19:27.216
Please!

19:32.305 --> 19:33.755
Tara Hanson was a teacher.

19:33.823 --> 19:35.407
Alec Wyseck was a lawyer.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.992
They had dinner
at a nearby restaurant

19:37.060 --> 19:38.811
and were taking
an evening stroll.

19:38.895 --> 19:40.712
The M.E. said Alec's
throat was slit

19:40.780 --> 19:42.481
and he was stabbed twice
in the back.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.050
Tara was stabbed 20 times
in the abdomen and torso.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.553
Overkill on the female again.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.571
She's a brunette,
like Nicole Puli.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.839
They both could have
been surrogates.

19:50.907 --> 19:52.724
He left this
on the park bench.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.827
It's Nicole's.

19:54.911 --> 19:56.712
Her nickname was Kiki.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.947
The courier service
said the envelope

19:58.998 --> 20:01.033
was left with cash
in their drop box.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.719
The messenger himself
had a clean record.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.170
He's a star employee.

20:05.255 --> 20:07.455
This was a targeted message
for an individual.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.875
Very different M.O.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.126
It's a high vantage point.

20:11.177 --> 20:12.627
The victims chose it
for the view,

20:12.679 --> 20:14.629
the unsub so he could see
if anyone was coming.

20:16.232 --> 20:17.216
Hey, what's up?

20:17.283 --> 20:19.134
Hey, boo, I tracked
the ISP of the user

20:19.185 --> 20:21.403
who entered the spam comment
to an Internet cafe,

20:21.470 --> 20:23.872
but he used a prepaid credit
card, so I don't have an I.D.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.140
All right, thanks, Garcia.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.059
He used the same code
that was broken years ago

20:27.126 --> 20:28.660
in a riddle we cracked
in seconds.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.712
He knew we'd solve it.
It was a decoy.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.294
No, it's a taunt.
He wants to prove that

20:32.319 --> 20:33.248
he's smarter than everyone.

20:33.249 --> 20:34.456
And we fell for it.

20:34.457 --> 20:35.984
Well, if he's trying
to compete with me,

20:35.985 --> 20:38.153
then it means he's most likely
within 5 years of my age.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.538
The question is why.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.190
But the message might not have
been meant for you, Reid.

20:41.257 --> 20:43.325
A letter was hand-delivered
to me last night.

20:43.376 --> 20:47.095
The comment to the paper
was written at 9:03 a.m.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.081
We weren't
even in the city yet,

20:49.148 --> 20:51.600
so how would the unsub know
you'd be involved in the case?

20:51.668 --> 20:54.002
You did give your name
to the press later that day,

20:54.053 --> 20:56.772
and you said yourself
he knew we'd be in the park.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.775
If he's doing his best
to emulate the Zodiac,

20:59.842 --> 21:02.728
killing in such quick succession
would be a mistake.

21:02.812 --> 21:06.698
The shortest time span
for a Zodiac was two weeks?

21:06.783 --> 21:09.034
Maybe the unsub
doesn't have a choice.

21:09.118 --> 21:11.706
Maybe he's experiencing
a time pressure

21:11.731 --> 21:13.052
that he has no control over.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.842
We're ready to give
the profile.

21:20.330 --> 21:23.999
Unlike the real Zodiac,
whose goal was mass hysteria,

21:24.050 --> 21:26.846
this copycat's message
is directed at an individual

21:26.871 --> 21:28.071
woman with whom he's obsessed.

21:28.137 --> 21:30.350
The women that he's
killed so far have

21:30.351 --> 21:31.306
been surrogates for her.

21:31.307 --> 21:33.959
He was either rejected or
believes that he can't have her,

21:34.027 --> 21:36.645
so he feels a rage towards this
woman and any man that she's with.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.912
His actions
may be an attempt to impress

21:39.918 --> 21:42.384
the object of his obsession
or prove his love.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.102
The unsub chose
to copy the Zodiac

21:44.187 --> 21:47.155
because he wants to feel
as brilliant, famous,

21:47.223 --> 21:48.657
and powerful
as his predecessor.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.576
You should be looking
for a physically fit male

21:50.660 --> 21:52.244
in his 20s to 30s.

21:52.328 --> 21:54.654
He's highly intelligent,
but he holds a menial

21:54.679 --> 21:55.879
or low-level job.

21:55.999 --> 21:59.100
He has few friends
and fantasizes of a world

21:59.125 --> 21:59.668
in which he feels special.

21:59.669 --> 22:01.086
And the frequency
of the kills suggests

22:01.170 --> 22:03.602
that he may be on the verge
of losing the object

22:03.627 --> 22:04.827
of his obsession.

22:05.842 --> 22:06.925
I'm sorry I'm late.

22:07.010 --> 22:07.960
Hey, how are you?

22:08.044 --> 22:08.961
Are you ok?

22:09.045 --> 22:10.829
I need to talk to you
about Harvey.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.914
Look, if you need
to call off the wedding,

22:12.966 --> 22:14.266
everyone will understand.

22:14.350 --> 22:15.817
What are you talking about?

22:15.885 --> 22:17.803
You were upset
when you called.

22:17.887 --> 22:20.005
And you said
it was about Harvey.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.691
No. I had a fight
with my mom.

22:22.758 --> 22:26.111
I wanted to talk to you
about my surprise for Harvey.

22:26.195 --> 22:28.063
A surprise?

22:28.114 --> 22:30.782
A man cave. It will be
installed over our honeymoon.

22:30.867 --> 22:33.619
I got a 60-inch flat screen,
a fridge for beer,

22:33.703 --> 22:35.803
but I need a "wow" item,
like an air hockey table

22:35.804 --> 22:36.699
or a mini putting green.

22:36.706 --> 22:39.207
Are you serious?

22:39.275 --> 22:40.742
Yeah. What do you think
he'd like?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.828
I'm leaning towards
the air hockey table, but I--

22:42.912 --> 22:43.829
Marisa, stop.

22:43.913 --> 22:45.964
Please, just stop.

22:46.049 --> 22:48.100
Do you even know Harvey?

22:49.268 --> 22:51.186
He'd hate it.

22:52.438 --> 22:55.307
Most guys like it,
but he's weird.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.542
Trust me.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.062
I'm just being honest.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.682
And now you hate me.

23:03.766 --> 23:05.984
No, I don't.

23:06.069 --> 23:08.103
I always say
all the wrong things,

23:08.154 --> 23:10.055
especially around you.

23:10.123 --> 23:13.775
I really just want you
to like me.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.194
I've always wanted that.

23:17.330 --> 23:19.915
I do like you.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.486
Look, I gotta run. I have so
much wedding stuff to do.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.316
Order more flowers,

23:26.341 --> 23:27.541
I have another dress
fitting at 2:00,

23:27.974 --> 23:28.957
pick up gifts.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.294
Thank you.
I'll see you later.

23:46.109 --> 23:49.778
Hey. Are you gonna
tell me what's up?

23:51.614 --> 23:53.699
Reid, it's me.

23:58.154 --> 24:00.572
Do you even wonder
if you lived up to expectations?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.708
Mm...I beat them.

24:02.792 --> 24:06.194
I figured I'd be
a bored socialite by 25.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.431
I thought I'd cure
schizophrenia

24:08.456 --> 24:09.656
by the time I was 25.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.866
You know, when I was a kid,

24:11.918 --> 24:14.453
people told me
that I could do anything.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.938
You're afraid
you've let people down?

24:17.006 --> 24:19.241
No, I'm afraid
I've let myself down.

24:19.308 --> 24:21.943
By not curing
schizophrenia?

24:22.011 --> 24:25.414
No, just because...

24:25.481 --> 24:27.749
I don't know why
I'm in the FBI.

24:27.817 --> 24:30.068
I see.

24:30.153 --> 24:33.105
You're a genius, but you have
the same job as me,

24:33.189 --> 24:35.307
Morgan, JJ.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.576
Yeah, exactly. No, that's not
what I'm saying.

24:37.660 --> 24:40.164
It's just sometimes--
sometimes I kind of

24:40.189 --> 24:41.196
get this feeling like--

24:41.197 --> 24:44.399
like maybe I should have done
something more with my life.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.568
Hold old are you? 29.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.620
I'm 30.

24:48.704 --> 24:51.490
No way.
We missed your birthday?

24:51.557 --> 24:53.408
Well--why didn't you
tell us?

24:53.459 --> 24:57.095
The fact of the matter
is you're young.

24:57.180 --> 24:58.780
There's still time.

24:58.848 --> 25:00.248
By the time Nicola Tesla
was 30,

25:00.299 --> 25:02.384
he'd already invented
the induction motor.

25:04.303 --> 25:07.105
You know what?
You might be right.

25:07.190 --> 25:08.808
You don't hear that much

25:08.833 --> 25:09.975
about child prodigies
once they grow up.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.344
In fact, most of them
turn out average.

25:12.411 --> 25:13.954
That's not true.

25:13.979 --> 25:15.579
Are you trying reverse
psychology with me?

25:15.665 --> 25:18.016
I'm just telling it
like it is.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.451
What are you doing?

25:19.535 --> 25:21.620
Well, you just told me
yourself you're washed up.

25:21.704 --> 25:22.988
I should take a look
at this.

25:23.072 --> 25:24.172
That's not what I'm saying.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.024
It's--seriously,
what are you doing?

25:26.092 --> 25:27.526
I'm just looking
to see what you missed.

25:27.593 --> 25:29.795
Don't do--you're gonna
actually mess it up. Emily--

25:29.879 --> 25:32.080
give it back.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.223
Wait a minute, that's it.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.608
The real code is in the words.

25:45.511 --> 25:48.647
"China Weekly Post," page F-4.

25:53.803 --> 25:57.739
The spam had to be converted
from matrix code to binary code,

25:57.806 --> 26:00.242
then switched to base 8 before
being translated back into letters.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.910
I can go into more detail
if you want.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.454
Uh, no. How smart
would a person have to be

26:03.479 --> 26:04.679
to write code like that?

26:05.147 --> 26:08.450
Beyond smart. Profoundly gifted.
An I.Q. Of at least 160.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.920
That changes
the profile, then.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.222
The unsub could still hold
a menial or low-level job.

26:14.290 --> 26:15.924
Many believe that
beyond an I.Q. Of 120,

26:15.991 --> 26:17.843
success is determined
by other factors.

26:17.927 --> 26:20.028
This is a bilingual paper.

26:20.053 --> 26:21.704
The English version
should be somewhere.

26:21.797 --> 26:25.332
Garcia, I need you to compile
a list of people with I.Q.s

26:25.334 --> 26:27.769
of 160 or above
in the region.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.521
Checking with the Bay Area
Mensa Society.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.506
Which is kind of slumming it,
'cause folks can get in

26:31.557 --> 26:33.525
with a measly I.Q. Of 130.

26:33.609 --> 26:35.553
Also check old school records.

26:35.578 --> 26:37.312
We're looking for someone
who's in his 20s or 30s.

26:37.313 --> 26:38.730
Yeah. Hit you back
when I got something.

26:38.814 --> 26:40.098
All right.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.683
All right, this is it.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.120
"You could do
some much better.'

26:45.187 --> 26:47.372
I'll talk to the manager, see
if they know who placed the ad.

26:47.456 --> 26:49.708
Who's this message for?
The writer's a genius,

26:49.792 --> 26:52.427
but the recipient would have
to be, too, in order to decode it.

26:53.796 --> 26:56.030
Yeah, Dave.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.216
All right.

26:58.301 --> 27:00.919
A cabdriver's
just been murdered.

27:00.987 --> 27:04.923
In broad daylight,
with no witnesses.

27:04.991 --> 27:08.560
The engine was still running.
What, was he dropping the unsub off?

27:08.644 --> 27:11.546
In '69, Zodiac killed
the cabdriver

27:11.597 --> 27:12.898
from the backseat.

27:12.982 --> 27:17.619
But this driver
was shot from outside.

27:25.494 --> 27:27.913
Look at this.

27:27.997 --> 27:29.247
It's another souvenir.

27:29.332 --> 27:31.983
It's digital quality.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.735
Can't be that old.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.137
There's a void in
the blood spatter pattern.

27:36.205 --> 27:38.023
It's a blowback shadow.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.342
Somebody else was there.

27:52.982 --> 27:56.276
All ads have to be placed in person
at the "China Weekly Post."

27:56.277 --> 27:58.795
This ad was placed
a week ago by a white male

27:58.863 --> 28:00.230
in his 20s or early 30s.

28:00.297 --> 28:02.248
A week ago? This was
highly premeditated.

28:02.316 --> 28:04.984
The unsub kidnapped someone
from the back of the cab.

28:05.052 --> 28:07.020
That could be
who the messages were for.

28:07.027 --> 28:08.882
Check with the cab dispatcher.

28:08.883 --> 28:10.375
Find out where the driver's
last fare was picked up.

28:10.662 --> 28:13.347
Morgan, see if there are any
missing persons in that neighborhood.

28:13.415 --> 28:16.183
JJ and I can look for ATM and other
surveillance cameras near the newspaper.

28:16.268 --> 28:17.935
What do you have, Garcia?

28:17.986 --> 28:19.482
Precious information.

28:19.507 --> 28:21.705
The little boy in the photo,
his name is Robbie Shaw,

28:21.706 --> 28:23.274
he disappeared from Mill Valley

28:23.299 --> 28:25.495
in 2000 and no suspects
were ever identified.

28:33.451 --> 28:36.420
Ready for a wild time?

28:38.089 --> 28:39.957
I can't believe
you're taking me to Vegas.

28:40.008 --> 28:43.177
I'm unavoidable
for 48 hours.

28:43.261 --> 28:46.463
I told you I was sorry.

28:46.514 --> 28:48.515
I'm kidding.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.001
Hey, you're
a big shot now.

28:51.052 --> 28:53.437
You could be, too, you know.

28:53.504 --> 28:55.639
I'm not like you.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.675
Marisa thinks you're great.

28:58.727 --> 29:01.011
But clearly
she prefers you.

29:01.062 --> 29:03.513
Where are you going?
The airport's the other way.

29:03.565 --> 29:04.899
Change of plans.

29:11.406 --> 29:13.407
Got it.

29:13.491 --> 29:16.493
The cabdriver's last fare
was in the Marina district,

29:16.544 --> 29:18.245
the 500 block of Chestnut.

29:18.330 --> 29:19.747
Lots of bars, restaurants,
shops there.

29:19.831 --> 29:22.583
Garcia says nobody's been
reported missing in the area.

29:22.651 --> 29:26.203
Passengers from the Marina, they'd
be young, educated, well-to-do.

29:26.254 --> 29:27.421
What's he doing?

29:27.505 --> 29:28.923
We've been thinking
about this case too linearly.

29:29.007 --> 29:30.424
Based on the complexity
of the code, it's obvious

29:30.508 --> 29:32.092
this unsub is operating
on several different levels,

29:32.177 --> 29:35.095
so we need to start thinking
in multiple dimensions.

29:45.223 --> 29:46.340
Where are we?

29:53.031 --> 29:55.449
This is our old Zodiac book.

29:55.533 --> 29:56.951
He's back.

29:57.018 --> 29:59.954
He murdered two Berkeley
students over there the other night.

30:00.021 --> 30:02.623
I know.

30:02.707 --> 30:06.043
Did you look for ciphers?
You still read the "Chronicle," don't you?

30:06.094 --> 30:09.797
No. Marisa prefers
the "Examiner."

30:09.881 --> 30:11.432
What are we doing here?

30:12.717 --> 30:17.955
Remember...How we thought
we could catch the Zodiac?

30:18.023 --> 30:20.057
We were obsessed
with the idea.

30:20.108 --> 30:22.643
We were 12.

30:22.727 --> 30:24.111
Exactly.

30:24.195 --> 30:25.980
We were kids.

30:26.064 --> 30:27.564
But we can catch him now.

30:27.615 --> 30:30.818
You know the police
won't find him.

30:30.902 --> 30:32.653
Come on, Caleb.

30:32.737 --> 30:34.455
Give it a try.

30:34.539 --> 30:37.658
For old times' sake.

30:52.590 --> 30:54.892
So, you're the Zodiac.

30:54.959 --> 30:58.628
Maybe you stalked
this couple

30:58.680 --> 31:00.647
or you waited at
the bottom of the hill

31:00.732 --> 31:02.299
for the right victims
to come by.

31:02.350 --> 31:03.717
Can we make this quick?

31:03.785 --> 31:06.854
Well, that's up to you.

31:10.525 --> 31:13.477
I'd be wearing
a regular jacket,

31:13.528 --> 31:16.330
covering up
my Zodiac hoodie.

31:16.414 --> 31:19.383
No one who saw you
would think twice.

31:19.451 --> 31:24.371
I'd sneak up on them
through the trees...

31:24.456 --> 31:26.656
drop the jacket...

31:26.708 --> 31:28.892
and pull out my gun.

31:42.673 --> 31:45.275
Hey. We went through
all the surveillance footage

31:45.343 --> 31:46.944
near the newspaper.
There's nothing.

31:47.011 --> 31:49.179
Spence, you ok?

31:49.230 --> 31:50.514
Nothing is accidental.

31:50.565 --> 31:52.849
Nothing this unsub does
is accidental.

31:52.901 --> 31:55.953
The message in the "China
Weekly Post" was on page F-4.

31:56.020 --> 31:57.287
Why F-4?

31:57.355 --> 31:59.123
That's where
the classifieds were.

31:59.190 --> 32:01.408
It's more than that.

32:02.527 --> 32:04.628
I stab him,

32:04.695 --> 32:05.946
then I go to her.

32:06.014 --> 32:09.767
And you turn her over
because you want her to see you.

32:09.834 --> 32:12.453
No! Please!

32:12.520 --> 32:14.037
I get off on her terror.

32:14.089 --> 32:17.758
I want to see her face
as I destroy her.

32:17.842 --> 32:20.060
Admit it.

32:20.145 --> 32:22.479
You're having fun.

32:22.547 --> 32:24.314
I'm being a good sport.

32:27.519 --> 32:29.987
What do you think Marisa
would think of this?

32:30.054 --> 32:33.907
She'd find it strange,
but so would anyone.

32:35.226 --> 32:37.528
You think you two are really
right for each other?

32:40.748 --> 32:44.067
I'd park there under the trees
so I could leave quickly.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.875
Can you rotate that?

32:53.361 --> 32:55.796
See, F-4 is a chess square.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.798
He murdered people
according to a chess game?

32:57.882 --> 33:00.801
Specifically game 6 of
Fischer versus Spassky in 1972,

33:00.885 --> 33:02.769
one of the greatest
chess matches ever played.

33:02.854 --> 33:05.076
The murder locations
correspond with the final

33:05.101 --> 33:06.301
3 moves of the game.

33:07.358 --> 33:09.309
Garcia's lair
of knowledge and wisdom.

33:09.394 --> 33:11.311
Garcia, you have the list
of Zodiac case experts?

33:11.396 --> 33:12.638
Yes. Standing by for you.

33:12.663 --> 33:15.365
I have everyone who's ever
written or blogged about it.

33:15.366 --> 33:18.218
FYI, there are way too many
people obsessed with this sicko.

33:18.286 --> 33:20.787
All right, cross-reference that
with professional chess players.

33:20.872 --> 33:23.040
Oh, that totally helps.
Yeah. Ok.

33:23.107 --> 33:25.792
List is getting smaller
and smaller...

33:25.877 --> 33:27.227
Down to nothing.

33:27.295 --> 33:29.313
All right, open it up
to high-level amateurs as well.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.098
Ok.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.139
I'm feeling
dissatisfied now.

33:39.224 --> 33:42.226
I need something more
than another couple to kill.

33:42.293 --> 33:45.929
The opening moves are done.
It's time for the middle game.

33:45.980 --> 33:46.980
Exactly.

33:47.065 --> 33:49.733
I'm hungry
for a capture.

33:49.801 --> 33:52.886
The cabdriver
is just a sacrifice.

33:52.954 --> 33:54.655
To throw off
the opponent?

33:54.722 --> 33:57.558
I kill him because
what I really want...

33:58.910 --> 34:00.611
Is his passenger.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.664
Brilliant.

34:03.748 --> 34:06.283
So where is the passenger?

34:06.334 --> 34:08.952
I have a car,
so I can go anywhere.

34:11.706 --> 34:13.422
Unbelievable.

34:14.509 --> 34:17.427
Crack team of investigators
missed something.

34:18.513 --> 34:20.429
What, did I drop this?

34:21.849 --> 34:24.134
Of course not.
I planted it.

34:25.753 --> 34:28.338
Because that's the game
I play.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.310
Go ahead, Garcia.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.645
Get ready to love me more.

34:34.696 --> 34:37.864
I did a search of chess players
rated 2,200 or higher,

34:37.949 --> 34:40.317
which would make them Masters
but not necessarily professionals.

34:40.368 --> 34:42.902
I cross-referenced that search
with Zodiac experts

34:42.987 --> 34:46.572
and came up with two former
chess prodigies and best friends

34:46.658 --> 34:48.108
who used to write
about the Zodiac

34:48.176 --> 34:49.543
in their junior high school
newspaper.

34:49.627 --> 34:52.612
And I get bonus points because
they both have I.Q.S over 160.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.498
- Where are they?
- In San Francisco.

34:54.565 --> 34:56.583
Caleb Rossmore
is a city parks employee.

34:56.668 --> 34:58.802
Harvey Morell is an engineer
at a Chinese computer firm.

34:58.869 --> 35:00.237
He's about to get married,

35:00.305 --> 35:04.040
and, yes, I just emailed you
all this information right now.

35:06.010 --> 35:09.429
The fiancee Marisa Devon looks
like the two female victims.

35:09.514 --> 35:11.398
They were surrogates
for her.

35:11.482 --> 35:13.900
Caleb could be jealous
of his friend.

35:13.985 --> 35:15.852
Or what if he's afraid
of losing Harvey?

35:15.903 --> 35:17.168
If he was a child prodigy,

35:17.193 --> 35:18.689
he may no longer feel
special as an adult.

35:18.690 --> 35:20.290
He could be trying
to hold on to him.

35:20.358 --> 35:22.726
Harvey's engagement
could have been a trigger.

35:22.777 --> 35:24.111
Reid, I know Spassky
conceded the match,

35:24.195 --> 35:25.812
but what would
the next move have been?

35:25.880 --> 35:27.720
Spassky would have been
checkmated or he would

35:27.745 --> 35:28.945
have lost his Queen.

35:41.629 --> 35:43.714
Lock's broken.

36:04.035 --> 36:09.039
So, where would you
hide the passenger?

36:11.075 --> 36:12.442
Over here.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.042
Spassky's Queen
was in square E-8,

36:38.110 --> 36:39.377
so that would land us
in Richmond.

36:39.444 --> 36:40.879
Garcia, is there a connection
between that location

36:40.946 --> 36:42.013
and the two men?

36:42.081 --> 36:45.183
Checking now. Uh...

36:45.251 --> 36:47.825
Bingo. Harvey's dad
worked there as a chemistry

36:47.850 --> 36:49.050
teacher in the sixties.

36:49.221 --> 36:52.140
And...Oh, uh, Caleb
lived there in 2008.

36:52.224 --> 36:55.093
He worked at the Powerlinks
Gym on Second and Hill

36:55.144 --> 36:57.645
and the Dragon Temple
Restaurant at 636 Mason.

36:57.730 --> 37:00.231
All right. JJ, you go to the gym.
We'll check out the restaurant.

37:00.299 --> 37:02.133
Copy that.

37:02.184 --> 37:05.236
Zablonsky's wife recognized the
photos of Caleb and Harvey.

37:05.304 --> 37:07.155
They interviewed the
detective for an article

37:07.239 --> 37:09.374
they were writing about the
Zodiac when they were kids.

37:09.441 --> 37:12.644
They wrote a crime beat
column in the newspaper.

37:12.711 --> 37:15.363
One of them stole the photo left
at the first crime scene.

37:15.447 --> 37:17.498
It had to be Caleb. The message,
"You could do so much better"

37:17.583 --> 37:18.867
in the Chinese paper
was meant for Harvey.

37:18.951 --> 37:22.253
That means the original spam
message was for him, too.

37:22.321 --> 37:24.088
But how did Caleb know
that Harvey wouldn't turn him in?

37:24.156 --> 37:27.008
Caleb has something on him
or he's holding the fiancee hostage.

37:27.092 --> 37:29.377
Shut the front door.

37:29.461 --> 37:31.397
They were interviewed by police

37:31.422 --> 37:33.576
in 2000 about a crime
in their hometown.

37:35.467 --> 37:37.352
You did this. Why?

37:37.436 --> 37:38.937
- Are you hurt?
- No.

37:39.004 --> 37:40.605
We don't need her.

37:40.672 --> 37:41.606
Are you insane?
I love her!

37:41.673 --> 37:43.107
Aah!

37:43.175 --> 37:45.860
Do you even know her?

37:45.945 --> 37:47.695
She doesn't know you.

37:47.780 --> 37:50.114
She's an inferior being,
Harvey.

37:50.182 --> 37:51.115
She's a good person.

37:51.183 --> 37:52.283
She is an imbecile!

37:52.351 --> 37:54.035
How you ended up with her

37:54.119 --> 37:55.870
has confounded me
from day one.

37:55.955 --> 37:59.107
She'll never understand you
like I do.

37:59.174 --> 38:01.092
You've lost your mind.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.862
Why do things
have to change?

38:04.914 --> 38:06.214
Grow up, Caleb!

38:06.298 --> 38:07.882
We couldn't keep doing
the same things forever.

38:07.967 --> 38:11.953
Why not? I know
you had fun tonight.

38:12.021 --> 38:16.307
Almost as much fun as what
we did when we were 15.

38:20.145 --> 38:23.214
He didn't tell you,
did he?

38:26.051 --> 38:28.319
That's Caleb's car.

38:45.004 --> 38:47.071
They're in the back.

38:47.122 --> 38:48.923
If it's a hostage situation,

38:49.008 --> 38:51.142
Caleb's not going to be
easily talked down.

38:51.210 --> 38:52.627
Shut up, Caleb.

38:52.711 --> 38:57.632
We murdered
little Robbie Shaw.

38:57.716 --> 38:58.883
How old was he,
Harvey, 7?

38:58.934 --> 38:59.884
He's lying.

38:59.935 --> 39:01.936
It was such a thrill.

39:02.021 --> 39:03.354
- Remember?
- Harv?

39:03.422 --> 39:05.206
Don't listen to him.

39:05.274 --> 39:06.391
Forget about her.

39:06.442 --> 39:08.860
I did all this
to save you,

39:08.927 --> 39:11.362
from a life of misery,

39:11.430 --> 39:12.730
of pretending to be
somebody you're not.

39:12.781 --> 39:14.949
U murdered all those people
to save me?!

39:15.034 --> 39:18.903
Stop being so sanctimonious!
It doesn't suit you.

39:20.205 --> 39:25.460
Now...Do you want
to kill her or should I?

39:25.544 --> 39:27.362
You know that's how
the game has to end.

39:27.429 --> 39:28.863
This isn't a game.

39:28.931 --> 39:30.515
If we get rid of her now,
we'll be long gone

39:30.582 --> 39:32.216
before she's found.

39:32.284 --> 39:33.740
And the police
won't catch us because

39:33.765 --> 39:34.965
the murders were perfect.

39:36.055 --> 39:37.338
Just like Robbie Shaw.

39:37.423 --> 39:38.339
Not really.

39:38.424 --> 39:39.674
If they were perfect,

39:39.758 --> 39:42.193
I probably wouldn't
be here right now.

39:42.261 --> 39:45.546
I had nothing to do
with this.

39:45.614 --> 39:49.400
You really went out of your way
to impress Harvey, Caleb.

39:49.468 --> 39:52.136
The murders,
the chess game,

39:52.187 --> 39:55.156
all designed
to entice him.

39:55.240 --> 39:58.809
Yes. He is pathological.

39:58.861 --> 40:00.912
I don't know if Harvey's
the best friend in the world

40:00.979 --> 40:02.196
to be selling you out
like that.

40:02.281 --> 40:04.248
I mean, after you killed
Robbie Shaw together,

40:04.316 --> 40:06.834
you probably thought that you
guys had an unbreakable bond.

40:06.919 --> 40:11.122
He murdered Robbie
by himself.

40:11.173 --> 40:16.994
When we took him into the woods
and strangled him...

40:17.046 --> 40:19.714
I've never seen you
so exhilarated.

40:19.798 --> 40:23.851
The look on your face,
you can't deny that, Harvey.

40:23.936 --> 40:26.220
But afterwards,
something changed.

40:26.305 --> 40:28.689
You two grew apart.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.341
I wasn't there.

40:30.392 --> 40:32.860
You pulled away from me.

40:32.945 --> 40:36.397
Do you know
how much that hurt?

40:36.482 --> 40:38.682
I would have done anything
for you, Harvey.

40:38.734 --> 40:40.735
I looked up to you.

40:40.819 --> 40:43.071
You know what I think,
Harvey?

40:43.155 --> 40:46.074
I think killing Robbie Shaw
was your idea.

40:46.158 --> 40:47.542
No.

40:47.626 --> 40:50.832
You chose him because
his brother used to

40:50.857 --> 40:52.157
pick on you in school.

40:52.197 --> 40:55.500
You're successful,
you're charismatic,

40:55.551 --> 40:57.251
you're dominant, which means
that you most likely

40:57.336 --> 40:59.587
made the plans
and Caleb followed them.

40:59.671 --> 41:02.090
Let me ask you this--
where did you hide the body?

41:02.174 --> 41:03.758
Listen to me--

41:03.842 --> 41:05.643
if I was gonna kill somebody
and hide a body,

41:05.710 --> 41:08.646
I think I would probably
use sulfuric acid.

41:08.713 --> 41:11.081
Especially if my father
was a chemistry teacher.

41:11.106 --> 41:12.049
Right, Caleb?

41:12.050 --> 41:14.185
Caleb...

41:14.236 --> 41:16.904
Don't listen to him.
He's trying to trick us.

41:16.989 --> 41:18.272
Do you trust him, Caleb?

41:18.357 --> 41:21.325
Caleb! Hey, Caleb!

41:21.393 --> 41:24.162
Whatever happens,
we'll protect each other.

41:24.229 --> 41:26.831
Oh, I'm sure that he'll protect
you if he's around.

41:26.898 --> 41:29.917
I mean, he is moving
to Shanghai in a couple of months.

41:30.002 --> 41:31.953
He put the transfer in
about a year ago.

41:32.037 --> 41:35.973
Did you--did your good friend
Harvey not tell you about that?

41:36.041 --> 41:39.043
Well, I'm sure that
he'll send you a postcard.

41:40.879 --> 41:43.514
I was going to tell you.

41:47.903 --> 41:52.923
Robbie's bones are buried
in his backyard.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.985
Let's go.

42:06.488 --> 42:09.773
"There is no greater
sorrow than to recall in misery

42:09.825 --> 42:11.943
the time when we were happy."

42:12.010 --> 42:13.794
Dante.

42:16.748 --> 42:18.115
Hey, Reid.

42:18.167 --> 42:20.067
Um, Hotch wants to talk
to you.

42:20.135 --> 42:22.069
What's wrong?

42:22.137 --> 42:23.454
He probably wants
to talk to me

42:23.505 --> 42:25.623
about why I've been
kind of weird lately.

42:25.674 --> 42:27.958
You are making a difference,
you know,

42:28.010 --> 42:29.360
one person at a time.

42:29.428 --> 42:30.478
Thank you.

42:30.562 --> 42:31.929
You know, I've been
thinking a lot lately

42:31.980 --> 42:34.315
about why I stayed
after Gideon left,

42:34.399 --> 42:36.901
why I didn't take
any of those other offers.

42:36.968 --> 42:38.569
Nothing is accidental.

42:38.637 --> 42:41.305
And I realized,
I don't know,

42:41.356 --> 42:46.310
there's just something
incredibly right about being here,

42:46.361 --> 42:47.745
with you guys.

42:49.031 --> 42:51.365
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

42:51.450 --> 42:54.035
Otherwise this would have
been really awkward.

42:54.119 --> 42:56.337
What would have been
really awkward?

42:57.989 --> 43:00.274
Happy Birthday!
Surprise! Surprise!

43:01.826 --> 43:04.262
Happy Birthday!

43:04.329 --> 43:06.047
Happy Birthday!

43:06.131 --> 43:07.765
Do you feel like 30?

43:13.338 --> 43:15.473
Ohh!
Happy Birthday, old man.

43:15.524 --> 43:16.474
Happy Birthday.

43:16.525 --> 43:18.025
I'm getting close.
Almost 40 now.
