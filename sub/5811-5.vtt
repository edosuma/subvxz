WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:03.491
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.680 --> 00:04.966
I'm gonna run for mayor.

00:05.160 --> 00:08.607
Mr. Palmer's last recorded statement
could shed some light on how he died.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.962
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

00:11.160 --> 00:12.605
We're going to Nanda Parbat.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.565
You need to feed this impulse.
Once you do, it will subside for a time.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.285
<i>I want you to bring my sister
back to life.</i>

00:17.480 --> 00:18.481
<i>"MALCOLM". Even if Sara went into the Pit,</i>

00:18.680 --> 00:20.170
<i>what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.</i>

00:20.360 --> 00:21.327
<i>"LAUREL". Your daughter is alive.</i>

00:21.520 --> 00:24.444
The most loving act you can commit
is to return Sara to her final rest.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.563
You are not gonna kill your own daughter.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.841
She's not my daughter!

00:28.040 --> 00:29.280
Sara?

00:38.040 --> 00:40.008
Damn it!

00:40.200 --> 00:43.283
Hey, honey! Why don't you just
leave that right there?

00:53.640 --> 00:55.005
Step off, bitch.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.686
Oh, my God! Thank you.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.244
<i>S. C. P. D.! Stay where you are.</i>

01:21.960 --> 01:25.009
I cannot thank you enough for
coming on board, Alex.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.568
Well, then it is a good thing
you're paying me also.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.926
- Sorry for the wait.
- Ollie, this is Alex Davis,

01:31.120 --> 01:33.930
the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.565
Old enough to vote, Alex?

01:35.760 --> 01:38.286
I owned a bar and I wasn't even
old enough to drink.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.931
I'm old enough to do both.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.810
Well, I'm glad that you're
joining the team,

01:42.080 --> 01:45.801
but I don't entirely know why I need
a political strategist.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.683
Well, I guess the question then is,
do you want to take office

01:49.920 --> 01:51.410
with 10% of the vote or 90?

01:51.600 --> 01:53.489
After you win, you still need
to be able to govern.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.762
Well, what has you concerned?
My lack of experience?

01:55.960 --> 01:57.200
No. We can spin that.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.448
No, I'm talking about the kind of
closet skeletons

01:59.680 --> 02:04.004
that could cripple you on your first day
in office. Your personal Chappaquiddick.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.248
Wait, like that game from <i>Harry</i> Potter?

02:07.400 --> 02:10.847
Um, Chappaquiddick was a scandal
involving a can't-lose candidate

02:11.039 --> 02:13.646
whose campaign fell apart
when he was caught having an affair

02:13.840 --> 02:17.606
after his vehicle went underwater
and the girl he was with drowned.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.484
Does that sound at all familiar?

02:20.560 --> 02:23.131
Referencing the Queen's <i>Gambit</i>
and Sara Lance.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.526
Yeah. Got it.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.165
You're about to do your first
on-air sit-down, right?

02:26.360 --> 02:27.327
Yeah.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.729
Bethany Snow. Ten will get you 20
she brings up Sara and her sister.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.610
Alex. All due respect,

02:32.840 --> 02:36.128
I don't think that people care about my
friendship with Laurel Lance

02:36.320 --> 02:40.405
and an eight-year-old scandal
when this city is disintegrating

02:40.680 --> 02:42.808
and there are masked,
armed men helping it.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.650
Not to mention there's a woman
in Pennytown

02:44.840 --> 02:46.524
that's just running around killing people.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.922
You're right. I'm sorry.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.964
For a moment, I forgot how the electorate
always cares about the issues

02:53.160 --> 02:54.844
and has zero appetite for scandal.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.568
You want this city united?

02:58.760 --> 03:01.570
You can't do it as the rich-kid playboy
from the tabloids.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.003
And like it or not, Laurel Lance
is a constant reminder of that.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.846
<i>So from this day forward,
when anyone brings up Ms. Lance,</i>

03:08.080 --> 03:09.570
you distance yourself from her.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.730
Hey! Just in time. I was looking for you.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.281
Why?

03:23.480 --> 03:25.403
I wanna talk to you about
something you forgot.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.761
What's that?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.485
That how you wanna play this?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.328
Fine by me, pal. Let's go.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.241
I don't appreciate the intrusion,
gentlemen.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.286
There's communications gear in here.
We've got ourselves a mole.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.249
And you believe it's Mr. Queen?

03:47.440 --> 03:48.680
Look.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.721
We've been on this island eight months
without a single problem.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.201
He shows up.
Suddenly, two guys find landmines,

03:54.400 --> 03:55.640
<i>and a bunch of drugs go missing.</i>

03:55.880 --> 04:00.363
Yeah. Conklin, you got me. I didn't wash
up on shore here after a boating accident.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.404
I parachuted in on a secret spy mission.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.161
- You wanna die a liar, that's fine by me.
- That's enough.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.091
Enough! There are more pressing
matters at hand.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.966
Perhaps if you were focused more on
external threats rather than witch hunts,

04:13.200 --> 04:15.771
you would've caught this man spying on us
in the fields.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.962
I wasn't spying, mate.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.688
Any of you squabblers got a cigarette?

04:29.440 --> 04:35.129
She mumbled something.
It sounded, I don't know, Middle Eastern.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.767
All right, um, we're gonna have you
sit down with a sketch artist, okay?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.240
Take care of that.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.931
- Dad. What happened?
- Hey.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.561
You tell me. These two bodies
dropped by a woman.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.689
Probably the same woman
that's been linked to the murders

04:49.880 --> 04:52.531
of three other skels in the past few days.
A blonde woman.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.721
Dad, I...

04:53.920 --> 04:55.126
I didn't know what to make of it
till tonight.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.766
This woman says her suspect speaks
some kind of Middle Eastern language,

04:57.960 --> 04:59.371
just like Sara.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.210
Is she still at your place?

05:01.440 --> 05:02.965
I've been looking for her.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.969
Why didn't you tell me, huh?
Did you tell Queen?

05:05.200 --> 05:08.488
No. Because he would just see this
the same way as you.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.523
Yeah, and how is that, huh? How is that?

05:10.720 --> 05:14.964
That Sara is just a thing that
needs to be stopped.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.366
This is my daughter.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.370
Then why did I find you with
a gun pointed at her head?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.570
I'm not proud of that, Laurel,
but people are dying.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.843
And if I'd pulled that trigger,
maybe they wouldn't be.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.522
I'm gonna go find Sara, and hopefully I do
before you or Oliver.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.323
Curtis, I need you to do something for me.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.006
Felicity, look at me.
Gym clothes, gym bag.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.521
Do either of those suggest anything
to you?

05:42.720 --> 05:45.246
Physical fitness. But then I remembered
you're a tech guy.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.005
I'm also a bronze medal decathlete.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.406
Bronze medal, huh?

05:48.600 --> 05:49.681
Beijing, 2008.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.121
Beijing. As in the Olympics?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.889
Mr. Palmer's recording. Did you play it?

05:57.120 --> 05:59.043
Yes, there's something off about it.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.210
You sure it's not the fact that
it's a dying declaration from your ex?

06:02.400 --> 06:06.246
I mean, that is some serious
Nicholas-Sparks-level stuff.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.041
Don't judge. Man can write emotion.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.526
No, not that. I mean, yes, there's that,

06:10.760 --> 06:13.286
but there's still some artifacts playing
that shouldn't be there.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.001
What about your workout?

06:18.200 --> 06:20.009
Didn't seem to concern you 20 seconds ago.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.129
<i>I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault. I got...</i>

06:28.360 --> 06:29.361
You hear that?

06:29.560 --> 06:32.131
Like there's more to the recording.
Something overlapping with it.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.324
I was hoping you could clean it up for me.
I mean, after your workout.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.443
It can wait.
I'm glad you changed your mind

06:37.640 --> 06:39.324
about hearing Mr. Palmer's final words.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.760
Thank you, Curtis.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.085
Oh, thank you for coming.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.282
Well, I think we both know I didn't
have too much choice.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.131
No, certainly not since you literally
doubled the number of daughters

06:51.360 --> 06:52.521
I have to hold over you.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.888
Or did you take my advice
and return Sara to the grave?

06:56.120 --> 06:57.963
You didn't take my advice. Pity.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.480
What do you want?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.648
A new beginning for the world,
a nice glass of merlot.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.251
Not necessarily in that order.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.762
And for you to do me a favor.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.606
There's a federal server farm
30 miles outside of the city.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.804
I want you to gain access and plug this
little baby into one of the computers.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.530
How much this thing gonna do?

07:18.760 --> 07:20.205
It's of no concern of yours.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.682
But don't worry, it's not like it's gonna
destroy the city or anything.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.726
Whatever that spa weekend did to
clear your head,

07:30.960 --> 07:32.724
it also improved your technique.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.010
You're effortless.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.841
Yeah, well, you know how I love
my hot stone massages.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.567
By the way, that political strategist
was a good call.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.123
But his advice was a little harsh.
I mean, distancing yourself from Laurel?

07:48.360 --> 07:50.044
I wasn't expecting that,
but he made a few good points.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.810
What? Like kicking your friends
to the curb?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.890
Well, my friendship with Laurel
is complicated.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.725
We have been in each other's lives for,
like, forever.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.890
I mean, you have been in love with
Laurel and Sara.

08:01.200 --> 08:06.240
And Laurel, she... She took me in at CNRI
when I was completely lost.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.320
Even Captain Lance, okay? He has been
there for us since Mom died.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.885
Okay. But your point?

08:12.080 --> 08:16.369
My point is that pretending that you
don't know who your friends are,

08:17.360 --> 08:19.249
it just doesn't feel very united.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.365
<i>This is your overlord,
Felicity Smoak.</i>

08:23.600 --> 08:24.840
We have a PA system?

08:25.040 --> 08:27.202
Yet another decision
I might live to regret.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.166
Hi! What's going on?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.243
Code 47 at a nightclub on Ninth.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.010
A blonde woman going cray-cray.
And since I'm down here,

08:35.240 --> 08:37.402
it's probably the blonde woman
we've been looking for.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.568
The woman who's killing people
in Pennytown.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.125
- Suit up.
- Yeah.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.281
Help!

08:50.440 --> 08:51.771
Run!

08:53.520 --> 08:55.284
Run!

08:56.640 --> 08:59.086
You have got to stop this!

09:06.960 --> 09:08.200
Sara?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.610
Your sister's alive, she's out there
and she's hurting people.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.571
How is she alive?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.240
The Lazarus Pit?

09:33.120 --> 09:35.851
Did you two spend your spa weekend
in Nanda Parbat?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.687
It was the only place we could
get a reservation.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.446
The bloodlust is worse with Sara,
isn't it?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.091
Because you brought her back from death.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.009
Yeah, and that's not the only problem.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.691
Sara's not herself. She's changed.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.121
Why didn't you come to me with this?

09:50.360 --> 09:51.600
Come to you for what?

09:51.800 --> 09:55.850
Your expertise with magical resurrection
or that judgmental look on your face?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.641
For help finding her, Laurel, before she
gets hurt or she hurts anyone else.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.649
And if I have a judgmental look on my face
right now,

10:01.840 --> 10:04.446
it's because you played with forces that
you do not understand

10:04.640 --> 10:06.802
and now people are dying because of it.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.446
- Who's he?
- John Constantine.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.163
Says so right on the business card
your boss took from me.

10:16.880 --> 10:22.011
He had this on his person as well.
Do you recognize these landmarks?

10:22.840 --> 10:24.046
Yeah.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.481
Good. Whatever it is Mr. Constantine
is looking for,

10:28.680 --> 10:30.648
I want you to find it and
bring it back to me.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.365
Oh, come on!
I'm telling you, you can't trust him.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.971
Then you can follow him.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.682
What are you doing? You actually praying?

10:40.960 --> 10:45.045
No. No, these aren't prayers, mate.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.730
Ah, ah, ah!

10:53.880 --> 10:56.884
Unless you wanna redecorate your lovely
hut with his brains,

10:57.080 --> 10:58.570
I suggest you drop your weapon.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.731
On the floor.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.571
You won't escape this island.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.001
I don't intend on leaving just yet.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.011
Come on, you.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.443
- You really know the place on that map?
- Yes.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.246
- You do? Good.
- Yes.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.088
You're gonna show me. Now drive.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.131
We need to talk.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.201
About Sara?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.686
Laurel told you?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.366
Not exactly.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.085
You gotta admire her consistency.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.886
Keeps her death secret from me,
her resurrection secret from you.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.969
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

11:40.240 --> 11:44.040
I think there are certain situations in
life where the word "okay" does not apply.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.890
Well, we're working on finding Sara.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.209
Good. 'Cause we got other problems.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.606
FELICITYI It's a RAT,

11:50.800 --> 11:52.643
a <i>Remote Access Trojan.
Basically,</i> a <i>computer virus.</i>

11:52.880 --> 11:56.965
A polymorphic code designed to target
and erase certain pieces of data.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.131
It's buried under three levels of
encryption. By the time I've cracked it...

12:01.320 --> 12:03.561
Darhk could be wondering why
I haven't run his errand for him.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.889
I'm not sending you to break into
a federal facility without backup.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.565
I don't want Laurel knowing
about me and Darhk.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.285
It wasn't suggesting Laurel.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.724
Oliver tell you that Darhk works for
an organization? HIVE?

12:14.960 --> 12:16.166
Yeah.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.845
HIVE had my brother killed.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.401
I'm sorry.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.491
And now, Detective, you're telling me
that you were working with them.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.481
For them.

12:27.760 --> 12:28.761
It's a long story.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.166
I've got time.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.163
This city's been hurting.
This is nothing new.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.489
Darhk comes to me.
He offers to help fix it.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.682
<i>He's got powerful friends. He's got money.</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:42.849
And this is months before the Ghosts,
all right?

12:43.800 --> 12:46.770
I didn't see him as anything other than
a concerned citizen.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.121
Okay. And then?

12:48.320 --> 12:49.481
Well, then he's doing all this good stuff,

12:49.680 --> 12:52.524
and then he asks me where the fire chief
is going on his vacation.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.523
<i>So, I give him the address of his
summer cabin.</i>

12:54.800 --> 12:56.006
Next day, the cabin blows up.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.202
- You confront Darhk about this?
- Course I did.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.681
And that's when he shows me pictures
of Laurel.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.166
At work. At home. AA meetings.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.721
So this thing with your brother,
is it gonna be a problem

13:11.440 --> 13:12.885
for us working together?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.365
No, Detective.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.964
Because you being next to Darhk
is gonna help us take down HIVE.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.968
<i>Any luck
connecting Sara's victims?</i>

13:24.520 --> 13:27.205
Just that she's only killed muggers
and street thugs.

13:28.680 --> 13:32.685
I still can't believe that it's Sara
we're talking about.

13:33.360 --> 13:38.241
That she's alive. I mean, I know how
it's possible, but how is it possible?

13:38.520 --> 13:40.363
The world is a much more

13:41.640 --> 13:44.883
complicated place than most people
are comfortable believing.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.560
I received an old message from Ray,

13:48.520 --> 13:50.522
from the moment right before he died.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.408
I almost didn't listen to it because,

13:56.560 --> 13:58.767
you know, I didn't wanna feel
that grief again.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.443
The threat of zombie apocalypse aside,

14:02.680 --> 14:05.923
isn't it kind of nice not having to deal
with the pain of saying goodbye?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.484
Only if it were that simple.

14:12.600 --> 14:16.764
Not a day goes by
that I don't miss my parents

14:17.720 --> 14:19.165
or Tommy.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.962
Then I think about what I would

14:23.800 --> 14:27.441
give just to spend
another minute with them.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.286
But what's happening with Sara isn't

14:32.280 --> 14:34.487
healing anyone's pain. It's just...

14:35.120 --> 14:36.610
It's making it worse.

14:38.240 --> 14:43.644
She almost killed those two girls.
I mean, why would she even go after them?

14:43.920 --> 14:47.527
Her marble collection's a little
incomplete. Just guessing.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.603
Or they have something in common.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.291
Well, the waitress was Stephanie Dingess,

14:55.480 --> 14:58.290
and the girl at the club was
Lindsey Poison.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.642
- Oh, my God! Both these girls...
- They look like Thea.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.921
Passing on the judgment for tonight.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.966
Sara.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.241
I just can't believe that Sara
would do something like this.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.611
She's not Sara.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.889
No, it...

16:37.080 --> 16:38.605
That's not it.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.889
Hey. Hey. How ya feelin'?

16:42.080 --> 16:43.411
Sara, she...

16:43.600 --> 16:45.807
No, I know. It's okay. You're safe.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.441
She tried to kill me.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.244
She's not in her right mind.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.244
You've no idea.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.890
This is the Pit.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.281
She's going through the same thing I am.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.408
Thea, I thought that you were better.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.604
When I went to Nanda Parbat, I

17:08.440 --> 17:10.124
killed two guys.

17:13.280 --> 17:19.606
Malcolm served them up
on a platter for me and

17:20.440 --> 17:23.125
helped keep my bloodlust at bay.

17:25.319 --> 17:28.529
Oh, my God! Thank God you're all right.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.125
Laurel, come with me.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.285
Is Thea okay?

17:41.360 --> 17:42.646
No.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.924
Not only is Thea hospitalized,

17:45.160 --> 17:48.767
but she has Merlyn influencing her
to kill people.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.126
What are you talking about?

17:50.320 --> 17:53.483
Just another thing that happened on
your secret trip to Nanda Parbat.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.729
Hey, I didn't tell you that I took
my sister to Nanda Parbat

17:56.960 --> 17:58.724
because I knew that you wouldn't approve.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.011
Why didn't you tell me you took Thea?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.682
- What does that have to do with anything?
- It's the hypocrisy that I can't stand.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.882
What? It's okay for you to do whatever
you have to for your sister,

18:09.160 --> 18:11.003
but it's not okay for me to do
the same to mine.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.522
Sara was dead. Thea wasn't.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.849
Then why didn't you tell me about Thea
seven months ago?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.843
Because you don't see me as an equal.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.482
Come on. Laurel, of course,
I see you as an equal.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.251
No, you don't. You never have.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.245
- You never told me you were the Arrow.
- Keep your voice down.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.249
You never supported me becoming
the Black Canary.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.371
And you never would've told me that
there's a way to save my sister.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.609
My sister, she's out of her mind
right now

18:44.200 --> 18:47.841
because of something that I did,
a decision that I made.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.364
Did you everjust stop and think
for one second

18:52.560 --> 18:54.005
about what I might be going through?

18:57.360 --> 18:59.567
I'm sorry about what happened to Thea.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.882
I really am. I love your family,
I always have.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.887
I just wish that sometimes you would
give a damn about mine.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.925
Get out.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.523
You sure this is the place?

19:22.760 --> 19:25.604
It's the place.
What's going on? Who are you?

19:25.800 --> 19:29.202
How much do you know about what your boss
is really doing on this island, eh?

19:29.400 --> 19:31.050
Making drugs.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.926
If only. Your friend Reiter,
he's the dangerous sort.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.127
What's that supposed to mean?

19:36.400 --> 19:39.324
It means there are things on this island
that bad people shouldn't have access to.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.927
Says the guy with a gun pointed
at my head.

19:43.440 --> 19:47.490
I'm not a bad guy.
A little hardscrabble sure, but, uh,

19:48.760 --> 19:50.728
I'm on the side of the angels, mate,

19:50.960 --> 19:53.930
at least when they're not busy trying to
screw me over.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.929
You're right. This is the spot.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.609
What? You never seen magic before?

20:33.680 --> 20:36.650
Go on then, Alice.
Down the rabbit hole you go.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.291
Nice job getting us in.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.528
You learn how to do that
before or after working with Queen?

20:43.800 --> 20:45.131
I'll save that for another story.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.526
Yeah, I bet.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.846
- Is this the access point?
- Yeah. Yeah, it looks like it.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.166
All right.
Keep an eye out for rent-a-cops.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.169
This wouldn't do my career prospects
too much good.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.326
It working?

20:59.520 --> 21:02.842
Yeah, I think so. Looks like the virus
is erasing files on people.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.363
Which people? And why?

21:06.560 --> 21:08.210
Both really good questions.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.845
Hey-

21:14.360 --> 21:15.566
Hey-

21:15.800 --> 21:17.211
What are you doing here?

21:17.480 --> 21:19.050
Waiting for you to wake up.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.042
Thea, I owe you an apology.

21:23.360 --> 21:27.729
No, no. There's no need for you
to apologize for anything.

21:27.920 --> 21:33.723
Yes, I do. I brought Sara back without any
idea of how to control her.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.083
And I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.840
That's why she's after me, you know.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.566
This bloodlust she's consumed by.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.726
It's the same pain I feel
when I think about Ra's.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.564
I don't understand.

21:53.720 --> 21:57.566
Because the person that I'm driven
to kill,

21:58.560 --> 22:02.121
the one who killed me, is already dead.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.368
Thea, what're you talking about?

22:04.560 --> 22:07.928
She kills me, she'll be okay.

22:08.080 --> 22:13.086
If the only way to save Sara is to
kill you, then that's no cure at all.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.963
- How much longer?
- Two minutes.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.086
- Wait. Wait. What was that?
- What is it?

22:24.400 --> 22:26.607
- I just saw my brother's name.
- What's that all about?

22:28.280 --> 22:29.406
What'd you do?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.251
Nothing. I just have to get
back to whatever it is this thing erased.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.761
No, we don't have time.
Security's gonna be on their way now.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.285
I'm not leaving.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.004
Drop it! Drop it now!

22:40.240 --> 22:42.925
Hey, hey, it's all right. Captain Lance,
Star City Police Department.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.724
I just tracked this hacker here.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.162
All right. Now, look.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.244
Go get some back up, all right?
Call this in. Come on, go!

22:51.440 --> 22:52.680
Go!

22:56.120 --> 22:59.124
It's a good story. Just wish you would've
told me before you gave me a concussion.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.965
Come on.
Then it wouldn't have looked real.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.770
I didn't know you were still here.

23:18.360 --> 23:22.809
Hey. Yeah, I just came to make sure
Thea was okay.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.490
I didn't have a chance to before, so...

23:24.760 --> 23:26.000
She sleeping?

23:27.160 --> 23:28.321
TFYing to.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.326
<i>Look.</i>

23:32.480 --> 23:34.005
I know why you're here.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.486
Okay, I get it.

23:38.680 --> 23:44.528
I want you to know that it's okay.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.364
And I want you to do it.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.001
About what I said before...

23:54.240 --> 23:55.890
You said some things that you meant.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.080
Thea?

24:18.040 --> 24:19.246
You sure you wanna be here?

24:19.880 --> 24:24.408
I hated hospitals before tonight.
Just another excuse to stay away.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.047
At the hospital, I looked Sara
in the eyes. She wasn't there.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.531
What does that mean?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.609
The Pit is not supposed to be used
on the dead.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.047
It brought Sara's body back,
but all this is happening...

24:34.240 --> 24:36.527
Because it didn't restore her soul.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.562
We still need to find her. Okay.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.563
Sara died long before you moved in
with Laurel,

24:42.760 --> 24:45.240
and she knew exactly which hospital room
to look for you in.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.522
What? You think Sara can sense
Thea somehow?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.722
And here I was just about wrapping my mind
around metahumans.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.042
Wait, we've both been in the Pit.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.245
Maybe that gives us some type
of connection, a connection we can use.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.729
Thea, you just got out of the hospital.
I don't wanna use you as bait.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.720
Well, I guess it's a good thing
you're not in charge anymore.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.251
We'll have her back, Oliver. All of us.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.969
I don't understand. How did you...

25:14.240 --> 25:17.403
Well, that's the great thing about magic.
It can't be explained.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.251
There are places in this world as old
as the world.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.569
Places of nexus draw bad people to them.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.289
This island is such a place.
It's no accident that you're here.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.971
Let me guess. "Do not enter."

25:36.120 --> 25:39.647
More like, "Only for the pure of heart."

25:43.680 --> 25:45.125
That's not you, mate.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.802
There you are, my pretty girl.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.844
How do you know it's a girl?

26:00.840 --> 26:02.683
I can do that trick, too.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.005
Clever boy.

26:06.320 --> 26:10.041
I'd usually be more artful,
but I'm on something of a clock.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.686
No!

26:19.480 --> 26:21.289
I'm not a bad guy, either.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.848
- Mission accomplished.
- Well done.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.648
Are you sticking around
for a cupcake or something?

26:36.840 --> 26:40.845
This thing you had me do. I saw some of
the names you had erased.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.041
All military.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.163
And here I had you pegged for a Luddite.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.805
Fast learner.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.407
One of those names,
Sergeant Andrew Diggle.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.361
What is he to you?

26:51.560 --> 26:56.248
He died six years ago. Why are you erasing
the record of a dead man?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.041
You know what? I'm gonna tell you.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.727
And only because you completed your task
with such efficiency.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.844
We hired an assassin to murder
Sergeant Diggle.

27:06.040 --> 27:07.166
Why?

27:07.360 --> 27:10.170
Afghanistan's an interesting place,
replete with opportunities

27:10.360 --> 27:12.567
for an enterprising enlisted man
to engage in.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.165
What are you talking about?

27:14.400 --> 27:17.882
Drugs, weapons, murder.
Your Sergeant Diggle was an eager beaver.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.886
Unfortunately for him, our organization
weaved itself into that part of the world,

27:22.080 --> 27:23.844
and as you know, we don't play well
with others.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.246
So you had him killed.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.090
What is this guy? Your best buddy?

27:27.280 --> 27:30.363
I don't see you associating yourself
with crime lords.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.924
Present company excepted.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.526
Now, are we done?

27:44.600 --> 27:45.806
Set.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.611
I have to say, it feels really weird
being back here right now.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.042
<i>Don't worry.
E veryone's in position.</i>

27:54.080 --> 27:58.130
It's nothing, okay? I don't think this
is gonna actually work.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.724
Oh, God, I take that back.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.611
Get her out of here!

28:29.920 --> 28:33.322
Dad was right. There's nothing left
inside of you, Sara.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.441
Tranq arrow.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.962
No. No, you said it yourself.
She has no soul.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.451
Laurel.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.486
Let's get it back.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.926
What?

28:53.600 --> 28:55.125
- Oliver.
- John.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.651
It's been a dog's age, mate.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.882
More than. Do you remember that favor
you owe me?

28:59.160 --> 29:00.844
I hardly expect you to let me forget that.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.170
How quickly can you get to Star City?
I need your help.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.691
So you're gonna perform some kind of
exorcism on my sister?

29:12.840 --> 29:15.366
No, an exorcism is a removal of
demonic possession.

29:15.560 --> 29:20.646
What your sister needs is a restitutionem,
the restoration of her soul to her body.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.808
And you've done this before?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.367
Once. Maybe a year ago.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.369
But don't worry,
it's just like riding a bike.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.649
I'm sure we have a lot of work to do to
prepare. I assume you brought a list?

29:32.480 --> 29:36.007
Apologies, I didn't have time to translate
that from its original Aramaic.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.806
You know, if I knew you were surrounded
by so many pretty girls, Oliver,

29:39.040 --> 29:40.405
I would have stopped by sooner.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.730
Where did Oliver find this guy? The Luxor?

29:45.920 --> 29:47.570
I'm just glad that the latest person
from Oliver's past

29:47.840 --> 29:49.410
is not another gorgeous woman.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.011
I'm not even going to ask.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.931
You got my message. I'm so happy you came.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.769
I'm her father, too.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.241
I hate to be the one to say this,
but what if something goes wrong?

30:12.440 --> 30:16.968
Oh, don't worry. If things go wrong,
then we'll all be too dead to care.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.202
Well then, now we just need a...

30:19.400 --> 30:20.686
I think I got everything in here that
you wanted,

30:20.920 --> 30:24.242
although I am not entirely sure what you
need a dead peacock feather for.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.760
Ah.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.083
Oh, nice one.
That's been bugging me for hours.

30:34.240 --> 30:38.928
Now, I've only got enough juice to send
myself and two of you

30:39.120 --> 30:40.770
to the other realm and back, so...

30:40.960 --> 30:43.611
I think it should be me. Um...

30:44.200 --> 30:46.771
I'm the reason why
she's like this right now.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.930
No offense, love, but from what I hear,

30:50.080 --> 30:53.448
you're not exactly bringing out
the best in Sara right now, are you?

30:54.760 --> 30:57.650
Laurel. Do you trust me?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.168
Trust me when I tell you this will work.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.447
Oh, there's, uh, one more thing.

31:14.640 --> 31:19.646
Whatever's locked her soul away is not
gonna give it over without a fight.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.691
So be ready.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.808
All right then. On with the show.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.291
Mmm.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.051
Oliver!

32:11.320 --> 32:13.209
Well, I've had worse hangovers.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.490
So what are we supposed to do now?

32:15.680 --> 32:16.727
<i>Help!</i>

32:16.960 --> 32:18.325
Laurel, no!

32:24.880 --> 32:27.531
- This is new.
- Well, new is why you brought me along.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.047
<i>- Help!</i>
- No, no, no.No.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.043
Well, I'm not gonna just stand here.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.730
We need a tour guide.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.726
Ah.

32:58.080 --> 33:01.721
This way. Unless you want to be trapped
here for all eternity.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.565
This is what
locked away Sara's soul.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.961
- How the human mind perceives it, anyway.
- Help!

33:21.080 --> 33:22.969
Get to the Pit. You need to work together
to get her out.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.804
I'll take care of our new friend.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.445
You want some, do you?

33:41.320 --> 33:43.448
You know, any time today would be good.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.126
Come on, Sara.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.202
Laurel. You're all right.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.811
You all right?

34:22.760 --> 34:25.161
I don't know what happened. You okay?

34:25.360 --> 34:28.806
What happened? What is she? Did we...

34:36.800 --> 34:38.005
Sara.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.841
Sara. Sara.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.650
You're okay.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.523
Thank you, John. I owe you one.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.685
I believe I owed you one, mate.
How's about we just call it even, eh?

35:02.880 --> 35:07.329
How about anytime, anywhere you need me,
and I'll be there?

35:07.520 --> 35:08.726
I'll take that.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.081
You know, the hair on the back of my neck
has been standing up

35:12.320 --> 35:14.322
since the moment I got into town.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.241
That is probably our current problem,
Damien Darhk.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.762
Oh, you've heard of him.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.006
You watch yourself around that one, mate.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.010
He'll make what you saw in the other
realm look like a bloody gnat.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.921
Any helpful advice?

35:31.160 --> 35:34.767
Yeah, leave town while you still can.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.727
Well, he's a very specific kind of yummy.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.004
Oh! I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear you
just say that.

35:46.240 --> 35:51.565
Are we okay? I mean, I just keep
waiting for you to blow up at me.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.688
Because you lied to me about Nanda Parbat?

35:53.920 --> 35:55.410
Yeah.

35:55.600 --> 36:00.527
Thea, I don't have the right to be mad at
anyone for keeping secrets.

36:02.720 --> 36:06.645
But I'm sorry that I made you feel as
though you had to. Come here.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.487
So, mate, I owe you one.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.449
What the hell is all this?

36:16.640 --> 36:18.961
This is the Orb of Horus.

36:19.200 --> 36:23.967
It's actually a grimoire,
an ancient spellbook. You asked.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.641
And, uh, what are you gonna do with it?

36:27.400 --> 36:29.926
Same as I do with all the other
mystical objects I find.

36:30.120 --> 36:33.647
Keep them in a safe place, away from
the Baron Reiters of this world.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.291
Remember what I told you about
this island, mate.

36:40.480 --> 36:43.563
This Reiter bloke is not only here
for the narcotics.

36:43.800 --> 36:47.247
But then again, it's not your problem,
is it?

36:48.080 --> 36:51.607
Come back with me.
I've got a boat on the southern shore.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.643
You saw those people at camp.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.001
I can't leave them behind.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.481
Well, aren't you the hero.

36:59.160 --> 37:03.643
I also can't come back empty-handed.
Conklin suspects me enough as it is.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.211
Fair enough.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.806
Here.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.011
Goons like Reiter, they're only interested
in the sparkly bits, anyway.

37:16.200 --> 37:21.127
The real power is in the spell.
Here. Here. I'll show you.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.043
Lift up your shirt, mate.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.166
What?

37:48.360 --> 37:50.249
What the hell did you just do?

37:50.480 --> 37:52.642
I gave you some insurance against Reiter.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.488
And when the time comes,
you'll know how to use it.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.487
Now, I believe that concludes
our business.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.046
Uh...

38:04.840 --> 38:06.922
I need you to punch me in the face.

38:07.160 --> 38:11.722
Right. My escape attempt
left a bruise, right?

38:12.320 --> 38:15.164
All right. I must warn you,
I've got a hell of a right hook.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.569
I'm... I'm fine. Thanks very much.

38:21.760 --> 38:25.048
All right, so just stay on message.
Unity, united community.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.840
- United. Got it.
- All right.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.610
Hey! Laurel.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.888
Maybe we need to work on your
understanding

38:32.080 --> 38:33.445
of the phrase "distance yourself."

38:33.680 --> 38:37.241
Only if you insist on continuing to use it
when it relates to my friends.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.726
Okay.

38:41.200 --> 38:44.522
It's your campaign.
You pay me whether you win or lose.

38:48.960 --> 38:53.921
I am gonna go keep him from quitting,
but I'm very proud of you right now.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.291
How's Sara?

39:01.560 --> 39:02.891
Resting.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.928
It turns out that getting your soul back
is exhausting.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.451
Yeah.

39:09.880 --> 39:13.601
Ollie, I don't know how I'm ever
gonna be able to thank you.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.566
Just like that.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.411
Well, thank you.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.726
And thank you for inviting me
here tonight.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.450
After what I said to you in the hospital,

39:23.600 --> 39:25.921
I thought that I'd be the last person
you'd wanna see.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.841
Well, you were right. I haven't always
been the best friend for you.

39:30.080 --> 39:35.803
But I'd be grateful for the opportunity
to try and start to be.

39:38.080 --> 39:41.004
How can I say no to the man that helped me
save my sister's soul?

39:41.280 --> 39:42.520
Yeah.

39:46.440 --> 39:47.680
<i>I've made mistakes,</i>

39:47.920 --> 39:49.160
<i>mistakes that have
hurt people close to me.</i>

39:49.440 --> 39:51.124
<i>But I'm not hereto run from the past</i>

39:51.360 --> 39:54.284
<i>because the past has contributed
to making...</i>

39:57.120 --> 39:58.485
I thought you'd be out celebrating
with Sara.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.290
Yeah. There's enough time for that.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.290
- Please.
- I figured I owed you something.

40:05.680 --> 40:10.481
I asked Darhk about your brother.
He, uh, gave me something.

40:13.440 --> 40:15.283
You don't have to read this.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.288
You can remember your brother
how you knew him.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.482
Are you sure about this?

40:42.680 --> 40:44.205
Yeah. It's legit.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.526
I'm very sorry.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.850
Thank you, Detective.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.887
Gut punch doesn't deserve a thank you.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.844
I wanted to know why

40:57.640 --> 41:00.371
HIVE had my brother killed,
and now I do, so...

41:14.640 --> 41:16.688
Felicity! Welcome back!
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.325
How many of these have you drank?

41:18.520 --> 41:20.841
It's "drunk," actually, and many.
But worth it.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.491
You cleared up the rest of Ray's message?

41:22.680 --> 41:26.002
I think so. The playback was rendering
when you came in. So, propitious timing.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.010
You're not even allowed to say "energy
drink" while on company time ever again.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.567
That's okay. I think I might be having
a cardiac incident, anyway.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.410
So, check out the message.
I was just about to call you.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.005
Wait, where's my phone.
Wait, did I call you already?

41:35.200 --> 41:36.725
- Curtis!
- Wait.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.008
<i>I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.</i>

41:40.200 --> 41:45.240
<i>I got myself into this mess screwing
around with my exosuit and nanotechnology.</i>

41:47.400 --> 41:50.404
<i>But recriminations probably aren't the
best use of this limited bandwidth.</i>

41:51.400 --> 41:56.566
<i>What I need you to know is
I'm alive and I'm in trouble.</i>

42:28.800 --> 42:29.801
English - SDH
