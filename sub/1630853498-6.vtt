WEBVTT

00:09.400 --> 00:10.680
Here we are,

00:10.760 --> 00:13.560
the hottest event on the
surfing calendar is back.

00:13.640 --> 00:17.280
Sixteen of the best surfers
on the circuit have descended

00:17.360 --> 00:21.560
on the legendary Bells Beach
for two days of epic waves.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.920
And of
course every carve, every barrel

00:25.000 --> 00:28.040
will be live-streamed and
judged by you, the fans.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.120
That's right Helen,

00:29.200 --> 00:31.080
this is the future of surfing.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.480
This is the Subtropix 360.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.480
There's been a lot of chat

00:37.560 --> 00:40.080
about our crazy-young
Wildcard entrants.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.400
Ari Gibson, Bodhi Mercer,
what's the vibe?

00:43.480 --> 00:45.040
Dream come true?

00:46.840 --> 00:50.040
Wait, so people are watching
this like right now?

00:50.120 --> 00:51.720
Yes, we're live.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.160
Ahh...

00:54.240 --> 00:56.480
We're trying not to put too much
pressure on ourselves, you know.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.600
I'm just projecting gratitude
into the universe

00:58.680 --> 01:01.600
for this opportunity and my
focus is on being in the moment.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.240
Seriously, tears to my eyes.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.800
Yeah like, seriously
you saved my butt.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.080
No, you were cute,
in a non-verbal kind of way.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.800
Hey um, Bodhs?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.640
I kind of got you something.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.120
A little present.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.680
Ari!

01:38.760 --> 01:40.440
I guess I've just been

01:40.520 --> 01:42.440
visualising this
moment for ages,

01:42.520 --> 01:45.560
you know, and I wanted
to mark the moment.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.520
You and me competing
against the pros.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.880
I got you this.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.000
It's an elephant.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.360
It's beautiful.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.880
You know elephants are
good luck in yogic philosophy.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:01.840 --> 02:06.720
No, no, not at all, but what
I'm trying to say is, is,

02:06.800 --> 02:09.400
like, I was wondering
if you would--

02:09.480 --> 02:11.000
No way!

02:11.920 --> 02:12.960
G'day guys.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.880
Excuse me Trav, I'm really
sorry to bother you,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.480
I'm just, I'm such a huge fan.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.360
-Do you mind if we get a photo?
-Yeah.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.000
-What's your name?
-Ah Bodhi.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.640
Bodhi.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.640
It's
no holds barred out there

02:43.720 --> 02:45.680
as Jenna Brosa
looks to built a lead.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.520
The two time US champ

02:47.600 --> 02:50.720
showing off that
trademark style and flair.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.640
Send in your scores people,
the result is up to you.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.680
Wildcard
Bodhi Mercer is struggling

03:01.760 --> 03:03.280
to find her groove out there.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.440
It's gotta be intimidating
going up against your idols.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.160
She's letting them
muscle her off every good wave.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.640
Brosa
knows how to put on a show

03:12.720 --> 03:15.240
and the online fans
are loving it.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.080
Anyway man I gotta head.
I'll catch you later.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.640
Yo! Brazil!

03:19.720 --> 03:23.200
Check it out.
VIP party tonight. Whoo!

03:23.280 --> 03:26.480
Hey America,
we're not VIPs.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.240
Hey Brazil,
VIP is a state of mind.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.880
We're going to that party,
believe that.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.480
100 percent!

03:34.320 --> 03:36.000
Hey darling, you know
that you don't have to go--

03:36.080 --> 03:37.880
Mum, mum, mum, look I
really appreciate you coming,

03:37.960 --> 03:40.960
but please just relax.
Okay I'm off. Bye bye.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.200
With some
decent lines on the horizon,

03:50.280 --> 03:51.680
they're on the move again.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.200
Brosa always dangerous
in these situations,

03:54.280 --> 03:56.480
but Mercer going for it.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.760
Looks like she might take
this one off the world champ.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.080
And as the clock ticks down,

04:03.160 --> 04:06.160
Mercer finally ekes
out another ride,

04:06.240 --> 04:08.640
but the people have spoken

04:08.720 --> 04:11.880
and Jenna Brosa takes
this one out easily.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.680
How you feeling Wildcard?

04:21.760 --> 04:22.840
Yeah, yeah good.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.040
Not a bad spot
for your big debut.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.200
You stick to your
carve game all right?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.440
Let the others fight
amongst themselves.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.640
They can do all
the flashy stuff,

04:29.720 --> 04:31.680
you just go out there
and be you. Okay?

04:31.760 --> 04:33.040
Getting here was the hard part.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.520
This, this is all gravy.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.040
Okay!

04:37.120 --> 04:38.640
Thanks.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.560
Only a few
minutes left until we kick off

04:42.640 --> 04:44.720
the first round of
the men's competition.

04:44.800 --> 04:49.120
Things are going crazy online,
already over a million fans

04:49.240 --> 04:52.240
have tuned in and we're
just getting started.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.000
One thing you need to
understand about being a mum,

04:56.080 --> 04:59.200
is that everything your child
feels, you feel times ten.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.440
Must suck to be Margot
after I've eaten hot wings.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.960
She's actually mentioned
Bells Beach before.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.960
It's actually pretty epic.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.960
We all used to come down
here and watch her compete

05:12.040 --> 05:13.360
when you guys were little.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.720
She used to get so nervous
that she would drag us

05:17.800 --> 05:20.520
all over to Back Beach to
get away from all the madness.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.360
Hmm.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.040
We're in
for a thriller here.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.440
Kai Dominick and
Leandro Martinez,

05:25.520 --> 05:27.760
both in the Top 10
on the World Tour,

05:27.840 --> 05:32.080
but what a trial by fire
for the kid from Shorehaven,

05:32.160 --> 05:33.960
Ari Gibson!

05:36.080 --> 05:38.240
Go Ari! Pull another mate.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.000
Good luck Ari, come on.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.640
Go Ari, go!

05:42.720 --> 05:44.320
And round one is underway.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.800
We've thrown out the
priority rules.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.760
So be prepared for
60 minutes of dog eat dog.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.400
Let's go Ari.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.600
Oh, look at
this fast start from Gibson,

06:15.680 --> 06:18.000
all of 15 years old,

06:18.080 --> 06:21.280
catching his more seasoned
rivals off guard.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.800
Go Ari!

06:29.160 --> 06:30.880
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.760
You should see how many
followers I'm getting.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.320
It's insane.
Everyone's frothing this comp.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.760
Yeah, sick!

06:37.840 --> 06:39.440
And don't worry
too much about the scores.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.440
You'll do better tomorrow.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.360
I was up against Jenna Brosa,

06:42.440 --> 06:43.800
it's not like
I actually had a chance

06:43.880 --> 06:45.720
Of course you had a chance.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.600
You just need to
make a few adjustments,

06:47.680 --> 06:49.640
and then you'll
rip it up tomorrow.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.520
Yeah. Cool.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.560
I'm going to catch
the end of Ari's round.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.480
These 60
minute rounds are a test

06:59.560 --> 07:02.040
of stamina as well as skill.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.840
And as your
online votes are tallied,

07:03.920 --> 07:05.720
it's too close to call.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.920
I could be
reading this wrong,

07:07.000 --> 07:08.800
but I think Ari's doing
pretty well here.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.040
See, it's possible.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.920
Look, big set coming in.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.440
Yeah, he just needs
to hold his nerve,

07:18.520 --> 07:20.560
wait for the right wave,
he'll be sweet.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.320
With just
under a minute left,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.080
all three competitors
on the hunt

07:24.160 --> 07:26.600
for that last decisive score.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.080
Martinez paddling
hard here, but nope,

07:30.160 --> 07:33.640
he lets Gibson have this one
and it might be a mistake.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.640
Plenty of open
space to play with

07:35.720 --> 07:37.520
and he's holding his nerve.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.960
Could this be the wave
that wins him the round.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.400
He goes for the big
floater to finish

07:42.480 --> 07:45.160
and oh, comes off hard.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.920
Oh and that
wave just detonates on the reef.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.000
Can you see him?

07:58.080 --> 08:00.360
A bone-
crunching wipeout for Gibson.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.640
Gibson,
hasn't surfaced yet.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.680
That's a notorious spot
there on the reef.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.000
It's super shallow

08:07.080 --> 08:09.960
and wave after wave can
just pound down on you.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.440
There's his board,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.480
his leg rope must have snapped.

08:16.920 --> 08:17.960
Yeah,
this has turned

08:18.040 --> 08:19.920
into a serious hold down.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.080
Gibson could be in real trouble.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.240
Hey, I'm sure it'll be okay.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.400
Hey, you can't go out there.
It's only crew allowed--

08:29.480 --> 08:30.560
Abbie, Abbie!

08:36.560 --> 08:39.360
Water safety
has Gibson on the slit.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.440
He's barely moving.

08:46.080 --> 08:46.880
Ari!

08:54.320 --> 08:55.160
Ari!

08:56.080 --> 08:57.240
Hey, you okay bubba?

08:57.320 --> 08:58.880
You gave us a bit of a
fright there man, you good?

08:58.960 --> 08:59.760
Yeah.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.760
No way, he won.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.360
You won Ari!

09:04.440 --> 09:06.320
You won the round,
that's crazy.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.520
So, Mum had a
great time then.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.320
It looked worse than it was.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.640
Ari, you ready yet?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.440
I can't believe they're
still making you

09:28.520 --> 09:30.120
go to this party after
what happened today.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.640
Well, they're not making me go.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.480
There'll be a tonne
of sponsors there.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.560
It's a pretty big opportunity.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.880
Opportunity,
opportunity for them

09:38.960 --> 09:42.960
to exploit more young surfers,
to sell more board shorts.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.040
Wow, you haven't whipped
out that lecture in a while.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.320
Here you go tough guy.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.360
One party shirt.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.160
Thanks.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.640
She's moved on to the furniture.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.360
Come on, you can do
your makeup on the bus.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.640
What happened?

10:28.320 --> 10:29.040
No, nothing.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.320
I'm just tired.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.600
We're all tired.
It's a tiring world.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.200
Look, I know today was intense.

10:35.280 --> 10:38.160
But it's a party.
You need to unwind.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.120
I can unwind lying down.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.040
Okay. But look,

10:41.120 --> 10:43.640
I've been stuck here for
weeks with zero entertainment

10:43.720 --> 10:45.920
and you're telling me you want
me to skip out on literally

10:46.000 --> 10:48.360
the only cool thing that's
happened since I got here.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.440
Okay, all right, sure.
We'll go.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.200
But only for a little bit.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.520
Ay, there he is.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.200
I knew there was a legend buried
underneath all that loser.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.040
I still don't know how you
guys think you're getting in.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.360
You do remember who
you're talking to right?

11:06.680 --> 11:09.640
-And smiling.
-That's it, look to your right.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.880
Hey Bodhi, you're Bodhi right?

11:21.400 --> 11:24.080
You totally ripped it
out there today.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.320
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
So much.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.920
I'm kind of waiting
for Subtropix

11:29.000 --> 11:31.080
to tap me on the shoulder
and tell me to go home.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.520
That is not going to happen.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.120
You totally deserve to be here.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.760
You just have to back yourself.

11:36.760 --> 11:37.920
-All right. Okay.
-I'll try.

11:38.000 --> 11:38.840
See you.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.960
Chilling with
Layne Beachley are we?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.840
I know, she's incredible.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.960
And I want you to know that I'm
going to do better tomorrow.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.680
Hey. You're 15.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.600
No one expects you to
blow it out of the water.

11:50.680 --> 11:54.120
Just try and have fun. Project
some next-big-thing energy.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.640
I'm going to go mingle.
I'll catch up with you in a bit.

12:42.480 --> 12:46.800
Hey, great job out there today,
now do you know Trav?

12:46.880 --> 12:48.040
Hey babe.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.200
Yeah, yeah we crossed
paths this morning

12:50.280 --> 12:51.480
in the dressing room, right?

12:51.560 --> 12:52.480
Yeah. Yeah.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.200
I mean, I've watched the
perfect 20 clip of Pipeline,

12:55.280 --> 12:56.720
like a million times.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.920
Yeah. Sick.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.120
Ooh Ari,
it's your big moment.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.080
Hectic stuff man.
How ya feeling?

13:11.160 --> 13:13.400
Yeah, yeah, um yeah, no, fine.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.240
You sure?

13:14.320 --> 13:15.960
You might want to keep your
head above water the next time.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.000
Don't listen to him.
He's just messing with you.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.280
Yeah. I guess I got
to learn to take it.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.400
See, kid gets it.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.920
Look, I really liked
what I saw out there.

13:25.000 --> 13:25.920
You keep surfing like that

13:26.000 --> 13:28.080
and you and I should
definitely have a conversation.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.280
Uh, yeah, yeah, no, yeah.
That'd be awesome.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.320
Anyway. Good luck tomorrow.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.240
I'll be watching.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.360
No pressure.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.080
Hey superstar,
pretty popular tonight.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.760
I guess.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.320
I don't know, this whole
networking thing's so weird,

14:05.400 --> 14:07.360
it's... a lot of--

14:07.440 --> 14:08.480
Pressure.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.400
Yeah.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.680
I guess neither of us
really have a lot

14:12.760 --> 14:15.560
of help from our parents,
with the whole career thing.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.440
We need this more than anyone.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.400
I know.

14:27.880 --> 14:28.640
Hey Bodhs,

14:28.720 --> 14:31.640
I'm really, really glad
we're doing this together.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.480
Can you guys hurry up already?

14:55.120 --> 14:56.480
Brazil can you stop moving?

14:56.560 --> 14:57.760
Can you stop creasing my shirt?

14:57.840 --> 14:58.720
Let's just bail.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.280
None of us were even in this
comp. We're nobodies yet.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.760
Ha, speak for yourself.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.280
After you.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.280
Yo!

15:24.880 --> 15:26.280
What's up?

15:26.360 --> 15:27.160
Love the hat.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.480
Hey look, maybe
I'm way off base here,

15:28.560 --> 15:31.640
but I just always felt that
there was something between us.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.560
That's really sweet Ari.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.440
What's up losers. Hey.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.280
Oh great.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.160
So what, did you guys break in?

15:47.360 --> 15:50.600
Bro relax, this isn't school.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.360
No one's going to
give you detention.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.720
How do you know, they could
disqualify us or something?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.320
No, this is good.
This is amazing.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.240
We're all here.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.560
That's it, I'm dancing.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.120
Someone's having a good time.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.440
Come on.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.840
I still really like her, dude.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.320
Okay.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.160
Plus, you and me again,
back to normal.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.400
You know, it's good.

17:05.480 --> 17:09.800
And you and Bodhi,
you'll mess everything up.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.800
You knew that I liked her,
before the accident I told you

17:13.880 --> 17:15.160
and it didn't seem to stop you.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.080
That was different.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.000
How?

17:18.080 --> 17:19.560
How was that different?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.280
You weren't around anymore?

17:23.600 --> 17:24.400
Look...

17:26.520 --> 17:28.480
I'm just asking you not to.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.720
It wouldn't be cool.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.880
No,

17:36.960 --> 17:37.840
no,

17:37.920 --> 17:39.400
no!

17:39.480 --> 17:40.440
After everything you've done,

17:40.520 --> 17:42.680
you don't get to
decide what's cool.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.560
Fine.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.200
Whatever, do what you want.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.800
Just go.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.320
Okay.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.240
I will.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.320
Yes please.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.520
You might want
to put that back.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.160
Chill dude. There's plenty
of merch for everyone.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.040
Hey.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.560
What are you doing?

18:31.560 --> 18:32.840
Nothing.

18:32.920 --> 18:33.960
Having fun

18:34.040 --> 18:34.880
Really?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.320
Cause it looks like you're
throwing this whole thing away.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.640
I'm just being realistic Pops.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.040
We both know the only
reason I'm here is

18:42.120 --> 18:44.480
because I have a sponsor
who got me a second chance,

18:44.560 --> 18:46.800
and because you were having
a bad day at the trials.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.640
Is that really what you think?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.320
It's what everyone thinks.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.480
Not me.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.040
I think you're
just making excuses

18:53.120 --> 18:54.800
so you don't have
to do all the work.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.320
And you're just jealous.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
Of course I'm jealous.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.600
You get everything and you
don't even appreciate it.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.920
What are you talking about?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.800
This, sponsors, Ari.

19:05.920 --> 19:06.880
Ari?

19:06.960 --> 19:07.680
Oh, come on.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.680
Like you don't know.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.880
Okay. Well you don't
have to worry about that.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.560
I would never ever go there
with Ari. It'd be gross.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.120
Ah, guys?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.320
How ya feeling?

19:37.880 --> 19:38.800
Yeah, not great.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.480
You get why I have
to talk to your dad

19:42.560 --> 19:44.320
about the whole
partying thing. Right?

19:47.280 --> 19:48.560
I'm really sorry, Manu.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.160
I was just trying to act like
I belonged, or something.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.200
Yeah, I get that.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.880
But this is the whole balancing
act of professional surfing.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.280
Okay.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.200
The parties, the travelling, the
expectations of other people.

20:03.840 --> 20:04.600
You have to keep hold

20:04.680 --> 20:06.760
of why you're doing it
in the first place.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.480
Don't forget that, okay.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.280
Hey.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.720
Don't forget that.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.120
The stakes
couldn't be higher

20:19.200 --> 20:20.560
in this final round.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.600
Every 20 minutes,

20:21.680 --> 20:25.080
the competitor with the
lowest score will be eliminated.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.880
Bodhi Mercer, looking
for some redemption here.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.680
Another
incomplete from Mercer,

20:32.040 --> 20:33.560
cannot string
her turns together.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.800
Alice Madders,

20:40.880 --> 20:42.480
getting right in the pocket.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.760
These riders doing
whatever it takes

20:44.840 --> 20:46.520
to stay in the competition.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.320
And the voters have spoken,

20:49.400 --> 20:53.360
Mercer has been eliminated
from the Subtropix 360.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.960
As impressive as it was

20:55.040 --> 20:56.560
to grab that Wildcard spot,

20:56.640 --> 20:58.600
Bodhi Mercer,
rightly disappointed

20:58.680 --> 21:00.720
with her performance
in this competition.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.320
Young Gibson back for more

21:09.400 --> 21:11.720
after his big
hold down yesterday.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.800
Gotta be feeling some
nerves right now.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.480
Have fun out there.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.560
Summer?

21:36.960 --> 21:38.240
Hey Summer, Summer, Summer!

21:44.560 --> 21:46.760
The next
round commences in five minutes.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.360
You guys seen Ari?

21:50.520 --> 21:51.400
Ari Gibson?

21:51.480 --> 21:53.520
Ari Gibson to the
marshalling area.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.280
Okay let's ah,
let's split up hey.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.040
Ari?

22:08.920 --> 22:10.120
What are you doing?

22:15.680 --> 22:17.400
Happened again didn't it?

22:22.520 --> 22:23.880
Thought I was done with this.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.000
Dude, I don't think
that's how anxiety works--

22:26.080 --> 22:27.240
I don't have anxiety.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.000
Okay, well something's going on.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.520
You're still having these
break-outs and I'm like,

22:31.600 --> 22:34.360
not really cool with being the
only one who knows about them.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.600
What if it happens
in the water Ari.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.120
No it won't.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.040
Look, this is a medical thing.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.280
Just go see a doctor
or something--

22:45.360 --> 22:47.120
No!

22:47.200 --> 22:49.760
Then my folks will find
out and that will be it.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.560
No more surfing.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.600
Abbie could barely
watch you yesterday.

22:54.680 --> 22:58.840
This accident! You're not
the only one it messed up.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.880
If you don't tell
someone, I will.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.960
Fine! I'll tell someone.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.040
What. Now?

23:12.040 --> 23:13.760
No, I'm going to
finish the comp--

23:13.840 --> 23:16.560
What!? Ari no,
that's a terrible idea.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.240
It might be the last comp
I surf for a while.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.400
I may as well make it count.
