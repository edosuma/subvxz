WEBVTT

00:00.273 --> 00:01.800
Previously on Good Witch...

00:01.825 --> 00:04.398
Couldit be
that Middleton's man of medicine

00:04.433 --> 00:06.533
is finally starting to believe in magic?

00:06.558 --> 00:09.210
No; I do believe in Cassie.

00:09.235 --> 00:11.368
This town's very own flower shop owner.

00:11.404 --> 00:13.571
That's me. Abigail,
the flower shop girl.

00:13.606 --> 00:16.247
This town really needs you.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:31.123 --> 00:34.258
Here you go. Keep the change.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.383
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.504
- Beautiful house, isn't it?
- Yeah, I kinda wish I was

00:47.540 --> 00:50.951
- staying for more than one night.
- Yeah, I've got a quick turnaround, too.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.921
What are you in town for?

00:52.957 --> 00:55.613
A career opportunity. You?

00:55.648 --> 00:58.706
Ah, just thinking about
some options for my future.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.388
So this could be an eventful
day for both of us.

01:01.423 --> 01:04.340
- I hope that it is.
- Welcome to Grey House.

01:06.412 --> 01:08.862
You must be Jim.
And you must be Annabel.

01:08.897 --> 01:11.431
Either she was expecting us
or that was a really good guess.

01:11.466 --> 01:13.833
I have both of your rooms
ready for an overnight stay.

01:13.869 --> 01:17.070
All I need is a quiet place to rest
before and after my job interview.

01:17.105 --> 01:20.540
- Job interview.
- Is it with DyNayTa Tech?

01:20.575 --> 01:22.409
- V.P. of marketing.
- Ah.

01:22.444 --> 01:25.042
Looks like you and I
are each other's competition.

01:25.077 --> 01:28.281
Oh. Well then, good luck, I guess.

01:28.316 --> 01:31.284
I should probably say
the same thing to you.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.988
Why don't we get you
settled in, and then

01:35.023 --> 01:37.524
you can both enjoy everything
Grey House has to offer.

01:38.929 --> 01:42.095
I set up croquet in the back
if either of you would like to play.

01:42.130 --> 01:44.497
Oh, thanks, but I don't think
that'll be happening.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.040
I never have time for games.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.212
- I wish I did have more time but...
- You and me both.

01:48.236 --> 01:49.753
When are we gonna get that?

01:49.778 --> 01:52.550
I just need to get
through today, get this job offer,

01:52.585 --> 01:53.798
and then move on to the next.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.608
You've decided you're getting the offer?

01:55.644 --> 01:57.911
They say personnel directors

01:57.946 --> 02:00.180
like candidates who exude
a high amount of confidence.

02:00.215 --> 02:04.350
And yet it's the more humble
who tend to actually get hired.

02:05.487 --> 02:08.455
Why don't we pause
this conversation for now

02:08.490 --> 02:13.126
and get you two inside, and maybe
you can both have a wonderful day.

02:30.178 --> 02:33.024
- Good morning.
- If you say so.

02:33.059 --> 02:35.949
- You ready for another day of beauty?
- At my flower shop?

02:35.984 --> 02:38.485
It'll be the same as the day before.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.202
No two days are exactly alike.

02:41.237 --> 02:42.848
People come in wanting flowers;

02:42.873 --> 02:45.058
people leave carrying flowers.
And then it happens

02:45.093 --> 02:47.327
- again and again.
- Abigail, good,

02:47.362 --> 02:49.999
I got you just in time.
I need some flowers.

02:50.034 --> 02:51.215
See?

02:51.240 --> 02:52.899
I'm trying to get
the city council members

02:52.934 --> 02:55.335
to approve my proposal
on speed limit adjustments.

02:55.370 --> 02:58.505
And I thought if I showed up
with flowers they'd be more apt

02:58.540 --> 03:01.092
to listen as I convince them of my idea.

03:01.127 --> 03:04.210
Do you even know why
people are against it?

03:05.971 --> 03:08.794
I don't see how that matters.
I just need them to know that I'm right.

03:10.021 --> 03:14.166
Well, you might as well say it
with flowers. Right this way.

03:16.892 --> 03:20.339
I do enjoy coming in here
whenever I get the chance.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.108
- It's just a room full of flowers.
- Really?

03:23.143 --> 03:24.676
Is that all you see?

03:24.712 --> 03:28.347
Just tell me what you'd like
so I can get started.

03:28.382 --> 03:31.350
Oh, well, I came in here thinking

03:31.385 --> 03:34.553
"carnations," but it looks like
you might be running low.

03:34.588 --> 03:37.723
Except I ordered a shipment
that just arrived.

03:37.758 --> 03:40.726
- I don't see it.
- Look again.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.362
I've got a van full of carnations for...

03:43.397 --> 03:47.299
- Me. Thanks.
- Great-looking shop you've got here.

03:47.334 --> 03:49.935
- Just tell me where to sign.
- Right here.

03:49.970 --> 03:53.605
Just use your finger. Perfect.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.807
I've got ten more boxes outside.

03:55.843 --> 03:57.776
- Great, you can bring them in.
- Okay.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.212
So, how many carnations did you want?

04:01.248 --> 04:03.980
- Ooh, put together a big bunch for me.
- But can you do it quickly?

04:04.015 --> 04:06.115
I have to get back to city
hall to greet a new officer

04:06.139 --> 04:08.286
and dive into the brand new day.

04:08.322 --> 04:11.723
Well, I guess I'd better help
get that day started.

04:17.697 --> 04:19.664
I didn't realize this house

04:19.700 --> 04:22.768
- had an actual library-library.
- I like to keep a mix

04:22.803 --> 04:27.406
of material so guests can find
what they like. Hello, Annabel.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.874
Hi.

04:28.909 --> 04:31.643
You look like you're enjoying
the spirit of this house.

04:31.678 --> 04:33.445
It's so rare to have the time

04:33.480 --> 04:35.792
to just curl up with a book, I thought
I should take advantage of it.

04:35.816 --> 04:38.183
Take all the time you need.

04:39.486 --> 04:42.287
- So, how'd your interview go?
- Pretty good, I think.

04:42.322 --> 04:45.157
They seemed really impressed
with my background in tech.

04:45.192 --> 04:48.693
Really? Because they told me
they really liked

04:48.729 --> 04:51.761
the unique perspective that my
non-tech experience would bring.

04:51.888 --> 04:55.467
Sounds like you both have
interesting things to offer.

04:57.838 --> 05:02.107
Edgar Allan Poe. He's that
"Quoth the Raven" guy, right?

05:02.142 --> 05:04.938
There's a lot more to Poe
than The Raven.

05:04.963 --> 05:06.614
People still read that stuff?

05:06.650 --> 05:11.054
- I've read everything he's ever written.
- And I'm named after one of his poems.

05:11.089 --> 05:12.818
Oh. I guess I'm the odd one.

05:12.853 --> 05:17.022
Maybe there's a book over
there you'd like to read.

05:17.057 --> 05:20.992
Make sure it has a lot of pictures.

05:23.317 --> 05:25.797
- What time is breakfast?
- Seven until nine.

05:26.411 --> 05:29.835
- Can I request an earlier one?
- I'd like to be able to eat on my own.

05:30.451 --> 05:32.838
And I was wondering if I could
get a different room.

05:32.873 --> 05:36.141
Maybe one not so close
to the other guests.

05:37.544 --> 05:39.344
Well, I promise

05:39.379 --> 05:42.624
to make both of your stays here
as pleasant as possible.

05:43.596 --> 05:46.718
- Thank you.
- Great.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.864
Sam.

05:58.899 --> 06:01.878
Hey. I was just checking to see if you
can still make our date for coffee.

06:01.902 --> 06:04.769
- Oh, tonight?
- Yeah,

06:04.805 --> 06:07.373
- we talked about getting together?
- Oh, yeah, I thought I could

06:07.408 --> 06:10.208
make it but... I have
a couple of guests here

06:10.244 --> 06:14.246
that I think I should stick
around and watch over.

06:14.281 --> 06:15.354
I see.

06:15.389 --> 06:19.417
Um, can we move tonight
to some other time?

06:19.453 --> 06:21.840
Yeah, sure, no problem.

06:23.780 --> 06:26.725
Okay, I'll see you then.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.894
I'll see you later.

06:28.929 --> 06:31.079
So, I take it the date's not happening?

06:31.104 --> 06:32.230
Not tonight.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.417
Shoot. I was all ready
to say "dinner is served!"

06:35.452 --> 06:38.370
I guess I shouldn't have
tried to surprise her.

06:38.405 --> 06:41.206
I'm sure you'll get another chance.

06:43.887 --> 06:45.911
Ready for another day.

06:56.562 --> 07:04.579
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:18.378 --> 07:21.576
- Hey. I will see you later.
- Have a great day at school.

07:21.611 --> 07:23.960
- Did you study for your history test?
- I studied all last week.

07:23.984 --> 07:25.862
I thought when the test
was postponed yesterday

07:25.886 --> 07:27.953
you might take advantage
of the extra time.

07:27.988 --> 07:30.088
To study the exact same thing?

07:30.123 --> 07:33.959
One more day might help you
see things a little differently.

07:34.995 --> 07:37.696
- Yes, Mom.
- Bye, honey.

07:37.731 --> 07:40.525
- Bye. Have a good day.
- You too.

07:47.007 --> 07:50.175
Here ya go. Keep the change.

07:51.044 --> 07:55.046
- I'll get your bag.
- Oh, thank you.

07:56.429 --> 07:59.284
Well! I thought you were leaving today.

07:59.319 --> 08:02.707
- We were supposed to.
- Both our flights got canceled

08:02.742 --> 08:05.168
and they couldn't rebook
until tomorrow morning.

08:05.192 --> 08:06.992
And you decided to share a taxi?

08:07.027 --> 08:09.894
Seemed like a waste to take two.

08:09.930 --> 08:12.230
Do you think we can get our same rooms?

08:12.265 --> 08:14.499
I'll make sure things
are exactly the way

08:14.534 --> 08:17.068
they were before.
Welcome back to Grey House.

08:17.104 --> 08:18.737
Thank you.

08:30.050 --> 08:32.683
- Uh, who are those for?
- Oh. You.

08:32.719 --> 08:35.020
And I've got ten more boxes
just like them in my van.

08:35.054 --> 08:38.490
- I didn't order all that.
- I sort of wondered about that,

08:38.525 --> 08:40.570
since they're the exact same
order that you got yesterday.

08:40.594 --> 08:42.605
Well, I don't need them,
so you can take them back.

08:42.629 --> 08:47.032
I wish I could, but
all I do is deliver, so...

08:47.067 --> 08:50.935
I'm gonna need your signature
here. You can use your finger.

08:50.971 --> 08:53.738
Yeah, I've done this before.

08:56.076 --> 08:57.909
Great.

09:07.254 --> 09:09.387
So,

09:09.423 --> 09:11.289
- when are you gonna try take two?
- What?

09:11.324 --> 09:14.793
- For your date with Cassie.
- Oh, I haven't thought that far ahead.

09:14.828 --> 09:17.562
Well, it's a good thing I have.
How about Thursday night?

09:17.597 --> 09:20.865
- I'd have to move some things around.
- Then move 'em.

09:20.901 --> 09:23.068
After the dinner rush,
I'll close down the Bistro

09:23.103 --> 09:26.404
- and the place can be all yours.
- Okay, I think I can

09:26.440 --> 09:29.741
- make that happen. Let's do it.
- And...

09:29.776 --> 09:32.677
I was thinking maybe we should
up the ante this time.

09:32.713 --> 09:34.525
This is something we're doing?

09:34.550 --> 09:36.092
You want the night to be perfect, right?

09:36.116 --> 09:37.000
Of course.

09:37.025 --> 09:39.551
Well, sometimes "perfect"
needs a little help.

09:39.586 --> 09:42.087
And you're always saying
that Cassie is doing everything

09:42.122 --> 09:45.590
for everybody else and you
wanted to have a special night

09:45.625 --> 09:48.760
dedicated just to her,
so this is your chance

09:48.795 --> 09:51.040
- to really come through.
- I just want her to enjoy herself.

09:51.064 --> 09:54.099
How can she not? I'm already
gonna make her favorite food,

09:54.134 --> 09:57.148
and we can get the exact
same flowers that you got for her.

09:57.173 --> 09:58.871
So she'll see what she missed.

09:58.906 --> 10:02.774
Except this time I actually have
time to decorate and make the place

10:02.809 --> 10:06.077
- look extra special.
- We ne decorations?

10:06.113 --> 10:09.114
Yeah. We're going all out
so that this is perfect.

10:09.149 --> 10:11.119
And you're gonna come
up with an extra idea

10:11.144 --> 10:13.084
or two to make this
date even more amazing.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.865
Now it sounds like you're
giving me an assignment.

10:14.889 --> 10:16.588
This started out as your idea.

10:16.623 --> 10:17.965
That's true.

10:17.990 --> 10:21.126
Well, now this gives you one more
chance to get things right.

10:21.161 --> 10:24.596
- And really impress her. Okay.
- Let's make it fantastic.

10:24.631 --> 10:28.032
It's already going to be
fantastic. I'm cooking.

10:34.407 --> 10:36.118
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:36.143 --> 10:37.573
I was unpacking my things

10:37.608 --> 10:40.078
- and found this in my suitcase.
- Oh.

10:40.113 --> 10:42.992
I think it's from your library, but I
have no idea how it got in with my things.

10:43.016 --> 10:47.285
- You're welcome to keep it, if you like.
- Thanks.

10:47.320 --> 10:51.990
I've always been a fan of Poe's work
in the field of dark romanticism.

10:52.279 --> 10:54.826
Maybe it's worth a look.

10:56.730 --> 11:00.665
- Would you care for some tea?
- I'm not much of a tea drinker.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.168
Would you like to become one?

11:04.051 --> 11:06.571
Why not?

11:09.543 --> 11:12.710
Mmm. That's pretty good.

11:12.746 --> 11:14.879
I brew a fresh pot every morning.

11:14.915 --> 11:18.183
Well, then I'm glad I ended up
staying for one more day.

11:22.289 --> 11:24.422
What are you doing?

11:24.457 --> 11:27.425
- You see this marble?
- I'm supposed to get it

11:27.460 --> 11:31.229
- from here to there.
- Oh. Doesn't look that hard.

11:31.264 --> 11:33.998
You wouldn't think it would be.

11:35.096 --> 11:37.435
Don't you think you've
already studied enough?

11:37.892 --> 11:40.305
Yeah, but since they postponed
the test again...

11:40.340 --> 11:44.209
I would use it for another day to relax,
since you already know everything.

11:44.665 --> 11:46.480
You're right.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.514
Okay, gimme the phone.

11:50.656 --> 11:53.218
So, how do I get a new marble?

11:53.253 --> 11:56.221
Tap the screen.

11:56.256 --> 12:00.191
Ooh, a purple one!

12:09.236 --> 12:12.203
Oh. Cassie didn't mention
anybody was out here.

12:12.239 --> 12:15.240
I've got nothing else to do while
I wait for tomorrow to come.

12:15.275 --> 12:18.042
Yeah. If it ever even gets here.

12:19.412 --> 12:22.247
So, how's this game work?

12:22.282 --> 12:24.916
You've never played croquet before?

12:24.951 --> 12:28.753
Guess I was too busy reading.

12:28.788 --> 12:33.044
So, what do you do, you just hit one
of those balls with the... whacky thing?

12:33.079 --> 12:36.828
Yeah, that's all there
is to it. You can use my whacky thing.

12:36.863 --> 12:38.630
Okay.

12:38.665 --> 12:41.399
- You want to be red?
- Yup.

12:41.434 --> 12:44.402
I was going to pick red.

12:46.306 --> 12:49.274
- You might wanna set a little closer...
- I've got it, thanks.

12:49.309 --> 12:51.576
Alright.

12:55.715 --> 12:59.250
Wow.

12:59.286 --> 13:02.587
I hope you're as bad at job
interviews as you are at croquet.

13:02.622 --> 13:05.556
Yeah. And I hope you enjoy
playing games in the yard,

13:05.592 --> 13:09.460
since you'll have so much time to do
so once I get the job instead of you.

13:26.313 --> 13:28.346
Thursday night?

13:28.381 --> 13:33.117
That sounds perfect.
I can't wait to see you. Bye, Sam.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.465
- So, you've never had a pet?
- Hmm...

14:03.500 --> 14:05.667
I might have had a goldfish once.

14:05.703 --> 14:08.770
A pet is something that
you can actually pet.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.741
- Is that the official definition?
- Well, it should be. Hello.

14:12.776 --> 14:15.911
- Hi.
- I hope you haven't given either of our rooms away.

14:15.946 --> 14:19.114
They're still available, if you need
them. Are you back for one more day?

14:19.149 --> 14:20.863
Yeah, we were on our way
to the airport when

14:20.887 --> 14:22.851
our phones rang
at practically the same time.

14:23.506 --> 14:26.354
The company wants us each to
come back for a second interview.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.757
So it really is down
to just the two of you?

14:28.792 --> 14:31.460
- That's what they told us, yeah.
- Jim's feeling pretty confident

14:31.495 --> 14:33.221
he'll beat out the competition.

14:33.246 --> 14:35.964
And Annabel's too "humble"
to say she thinks the job is hers.

14:35.999 --> 14:38.667
Well, then I'm glad I have the
opportunity to welcome you back

14:38.702 --> 14:41.870
to Grey House. And I hope
you enjoy your day.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.975
Thank you.

14:47.010 --> 14:49.311
Thank you.

14:53.717 --> 14:57.986
- This thing has been broken all week.
- I've been using flowers

14:58.021 --> 15:01.056
as my conversation starter
for the past few days,

15:01.091 --> 15:03.992
but I feel like today
I should try something else.

15:04.027 --> 15:07.162
- Is there something you'd suggest?
- How about chocolates?

15:07.197 --> 15:10.132
- When did you start selling chocolates?
- When I decided

15:10.167 --> 15:13.568
I wanted to be known as someone who
sells something other than flowers.

15:16.073 --> 15:20.008
I can't seem to get it to move.
I had bigger plans

15:20.043 --> 15:24.079
than just being a flower shop girl
when I moved here from New York.

15:24.114 --> 15:26.848
I figured this would be one small
step toward something bigger.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.604
Chocolates are a wonderful idea.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.564
The people I'm talking to will have
their mouths full

15:31.588 --> 15:34.756
and won't be able to say a word while
I persuade them to agree with me.

15:34.792 --> 15:37.425
- How many would you like?
- A dozen.

15:37.461 --> 15:40.862
- Oh.
- Everybody always wants a dozen.

15:41.765 --> 15:44.032
I have got

15:44.067 --> 15:45.901
a delivery for a...

15:47.538 --> 15:50.305
- I'm just kidding, I know who you are.
- What are you doing here?

15:50.340 --> 15:53.208
I called the company, they said
they got this all straightened out.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.010
Yeah, I thought that they had,

15:55.045 --> 15:57.779
but after I did a drop-off at the
bed and breakfast across town,

15:57.815 --> 15:59.929
I noticed you were back on my schedule.

16:01.216 --> 16:04.953
I have all this other junk
that I'm trying to sell,

16:04.988 --> 16:07.856
and now I'm stuck with
ten more boxes of these?

16:07.891 --> 16:11.393
Yup. Right after you sign right here.

16:13.359 --> 16:17.065
Do you ever get the feeling
that you're just reliving

16:17.100 --> 16:20.068
the same day over and over again?

16:20.103 --> 16:25.073
Well, I don't know, but he's
waiting for you to sign right there.

16:26.109 --> 16:29.544
You can use your finger.

16:31.281 --> 16:35.483
Perfect. I'll be right back.

16:35.519 --> 16:37.018
Great.

16:37.054 --> 16:41.056
Ooh!

16:50.500 --> 16:51.687
Is that feeling better?

16:51.712 --> 16:53.501
I have full movement
back, without any pain.

16:53.537 --> 16:55.670
Well, I now pronounce you healed.

16:55.706 --> 16:57.806
My string quartet's gonna be

16:57.841 --> 17:00.275
so happy that I can
play with them again.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.644
Wait. You have a string quartet?

17:02.679 --> 17:05.156
Yeah. I told them
that if the exam went well

17:05.182 --> 17:07.115
we'd get together
for a rehearsal tonight.

17:07.150 --> 17:09.332
You think if I hired you for a private

17:09.357 --> 17:11.118
performance Thursday
night, you could do it?

17:11.154 --> 17:14.955
- I think we probably could.
- That would be great. You're hired.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.059
Wait, I should have asked if
you're any good or not first.

17:18.095 --> 17:22.631
- You can drop by and hear us tonight.
- We use the recital hall at the library.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.699
I'll do that. On my way
home from the hospital.

17:24.734 --> 17:28.169
- I hope you guys are good.
- It's too late.

17:28.204 --> 17:30.805
You already hired us.

17:34.578 --> 17:37.345
I think we should have
fire drills every day

17:37.381 --> 17:38.997
- in history class.
- Un-huh?

17:39.022 --> 17:40.782
That way we might never have

17:40.817 --> 17:43.151
- to take the test.
- Okay, would you stop worrying?

17:43.186 --> 17:44.507
I was ready for it three days ago

17:44.532 --> 17:47.155
and I'll be ready for it when it
finally does happen.

17:47.190 --> 17:50.158
Except this time I'll be ready for
it too when it happens tomorrow.

17:50.193 --> 17:53.628
- Oh, it's not happening tomorrow.
- How do you know?

17:53.664 --> 17:55.497
Um...

17:55.532 --> 17:58.400
No reason. Just a feeling.

17:58.435 --> 18:01.136
But shouldn't you be
studying for it anyways?

18:01.171 --> 18:03.405
Why? You're doing plenty
for the both of us,

18:03.440 --> 18:06.541
and like you said,
I already know everything.

18:06.576 --> 18:08.805
I think Mister Beatty said
there might be extra credit

18:08.840 --> 18:09.994
on local history.

18:10.019 --> 18:12.714
Yeah, I'm planning on regular
credit, I don't need extra.

18:12.749 --> 18:16.251
Yeah, but I might. So is there
anybody who knows stuff

18:16.286 --> 18:19.138
on Middleton that could maybe
help us on the test?

18:19.163 --> 18:20.922
Um, what?

18:20.958 --> 18:24.092
Seriously, is there?

18:26.703 --> 18:30.371
Yes. There is.

18:30.767 --> 18:34.202
Middleton a century ago
was a fascinating place.

18:34.237 --> 18:37.539
There were settlers here to be
sure because of the fur trade,

18:37.574 --> 18:42.210
but it was around that time that people
started moving here simply for the beauty

18:42.245 --> 18:44.045
that Middleton has to offer.

18:44.081 --> 18:48.550
Oh, I printed up a list
of their various occupations.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.720
- That's if you're really interested.
- I am.

18:51.755 --> 18:56.224
- Now, what did I do with it?
- Chief Sanders would know.

18:56.259 --> 18:58.693
Chief Sanders! Yoo-hoo!

18:58.729 --> 19:01.763
Oh, that's right, he's out
getting our newest officer

19:01.798 --> 19:05.200
set up for traffic control. When I find
the list, I'll send it right over.

19:05.235 --> 19:09.471
And when I get the extra credit on the
test, I'll come back and thank you.

19:10.239 --> 19:12.040
It is so good

19:12.075 --> 19:14.242
to see young people
who are actually interested

19:14.277 --> 19:18.619
in history for a change. So many of you
are focused on other things like...

19:18.644 --> 19:20.453
Oh!

19:23.854 --> 19:25.720
Oh, sorry,

19:25.756 --> 19:28.390
my marble almost went in the sewer.

19:28.425 --> 19:31.059
Ahem!

19:37.492 --> 19:39.367
Well, looks like that's the last one.

19:39.403 --> 19:41.077
Which leaves me just enough time to get

19:41.102 --> 19:43.838
to my own private
concert at the library.

19:43.874 --> 19:47.542
- Oh, Sam.
- Cassie. What are you doing here?

19:47.577 --> 19:50.678
- I was in the neighborhood.
- You're never in this neighborhood.

19:50.714 --> 19:53.181
Maybe I was in it
because I wanted to see you.

19:53.216 --> 19:56.284
- Thanks for making the trip.
- How are things going?

19:56.319 --> 19:59.287
- Actually a little too busy.
- Here, and at the office.

19:59.322 --> 20:02.157
Why don't we pick a spot for dinner,
you can tell me all about it.

20:02.192 --> 20:05.693
- Oh, you know what? I can't.
- I've gotta go hear... I gotta go...

20:05.729 --> 20:07.295
not here, but somewhere,

20:07.330 --> 20:10.532
and do... something.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.719
Hm! Something you don't
want me to know about?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.302
It's about tomorrow night.

20:14.337 --> 20:15.839
Now I'm really intrigued.

20:15.864 --> 20:17.834
And you're going to be
impressed if I like what I hear.

20:17.858 --> 20:20.809
Or see, or taste.

20:20.844 --> 20:24.279
- None of those are clues.
- I wouldn't even begin to guess.

20:24.314 --> 20:27.549
Don't. See you tomorrow night.

20:27.584 --> 20:30.108
- You'll pick me up.
- Mm-hmm.

20:30.143 --> 20:31.933
We're gonna go in style!

20:38.628 --> 20:42.730
- Oh, hey Grace, is your mother around?
- Sorry, she's not home yet.

20:42.766 --> 20:44.685
That's okay. I wanted
to ask her about that tea

20:44.710 --> 20:46.334
she's been serving. The one I like.

20:46.369 --> 20:50.205
Oh, I don't know. She gets tea
from a lot of different places.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.808
That's okay. I can just ask her
tomorrow morning, before I go. Thanks.

20:53.844 --> 20:56.878
- Yeah. Have a good night.
- You too.

21:02.385 --> 21:06.450
I thought that guy was only
staying here for one night?

21:06.486 --> 21:09.491
And that woman who keeps
sticking around here, too.

21:10.021 --> 21:13.361
Yeah, you know, they've been
coming and going

21:13.396 --> 21:15.597
all week. I think my mom thinks

21:15.632 --> 21:18.633
they're, I don't know,
right for each other.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.276
Like, romantically?

21:20.301 --> 21:23.238
Well, it is my mom we're talking about.

21:23.273 --> 21:27.175
So, what, is it like... they're stuck
here until they finally get together?

21:27.686 --> 21:29.544
I'm not sure.

21:29.934 --> 21:31.513
Maybe.

21:31.548 --> 21:34.516
So when they do finally get together...

21:35.719 --> 21:39.120
...it'll be a brand new day.

21:50.021 --> 21:52.988
When are you going to come out of there?

21:54.374 --> 21:57.332
Yoo-hoo! I'm ba-aack!
I've still got one more person

21:57.368 --> 22:00.335
to try to convince and I've written
everything down that I'm going to say.

22:00.371 --> 22:02.337
I just need a box of chocolates

22:02.373 --> 22:05.741
to put them in a listening mood
when I launch into my speech.

22:05.776 --> 22:10.145
Maybe you should take two boxes, so you don't
have to keep coming in here day after day.

22:10.180 --> 22:14.082
And break up my morning
routine? Nonsense!

22:14.118 --> 22:16.385
Because it's so much fun coming in here.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.187
If I refuse

22:19.223 --> 22:22.024
to sign for those, does that mean I
don't have to take them? - Sorry.

22:22.059 --> 22:24.326
These are coming in
whether you want them or not.

22:24.361 --> 22:27.303
Just until I figure out
a way to stop them.

22:30.434 --> 22:34.369
- Be right back.
- Great. Are you here for the bouquet?

22:34.405 --> 22:37.105
Yeah. For Sam and Cassie's date.

22:37.141 --> 22:40.116
Were you able to make them exactly
like the other night?

22:40.141 --> 22:41.777
Yep. Exactly the same.

22:41.812 --> 22:44.046
- Great.
- Oh, I completely forgot

22:44.081 --> 22:46.207
to bring Grace's school
book that she left at my office.

22:46.231 --> 22:48.372
I was going to give it to you
to take back to Grey House

22:48.396 --> 22:50.096
- to give to her.
- I can tell her you have it.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.021
Please do. And tell her she
can stop by my office any time,

22:53.057 --> 22:55.624
day or night, and if I'm not there
she can just let herself in.

22:55.659 --> 22:58.393
- I'll let her know.
- And you'll put this on my tab?

22:58.429 --> 23:00.395
I'll just keep it running.

23:00.431 --> 23:04.066
- Oh, those look fantastic.
- Yeah, well,

23:04.101 --> 23:07.135
when you do something once,
it gets easier the second time.

23:07.171 --> 23:09.416
Are you sure I can't interest
you in some carnations, instead?

23:09.440 --> 23:12.975
No, Sam wants his date
at the Bistro to be perfect.

23:13.010 --> 23:15.978
And I have a feeling
it's going to be very romantic.

23:16.013 --> 23:18.146
I'm decorating the place way up,

23:18.182 --> 23:21.416
and Sam even hired a string
quartet to play while they eat.

23:21.452 --> 23:25.220
It sounds like the perfect setting
for two people to fall in love.

23:25.255 --> 23:27.910
I don't see how anyone could not!

23:28.732 --> 23:30.492
I'm gonna spruce these up a bit.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.329
Why the sudden extra effort?

23:34.365 --> 23:39.067
Because if I do things right, I can
get these deliveries to stop, and maybe

23:39.103 --> 23:42.070
that stupid clock will
actually start working again.

23:42.106 --> 23:45.941
- Yeah, I don't see the connection.
- It only matters that I do.

23:45.976 --> 23:47.109
Right.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.177
So, what time can you have it done?

23:49.213 --> 23:51.642
Five o'clock, detailed
and waxed top to bottom.

23:51.667 --> 23:52.804
It's all yours.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.829
The shuttle will be back in a minute
to take you back to work.

23:54.853 --> 23:56.232
Thanks.

23:57.526 --> 23:58.785
Cassie.

24:00.457 --> 24:03.501
Hey. I was wondering
if you were free for lunch?

24:03.536 --> 24:05.939
I was gonna to be driving out to
pick up some things for the store

24:05.963 --> 24:07.440
That a friend brought back
from the Sudan.

24:07.464 --> 24:10.298
Maybe you could meet me at
Merletto's on the way back?

24:10.334 --> 24:13.468
I wish I could, but I don't
have my car. It's being...

24:13.504 --> 24:16.138
It's getting ready for tonight.

24:16.173 --> 24:20.030
- Oh. I would've loved to have seen you.
- Me, too. I'll see you tonight.

24:20.065 --> 24:23.111
- Yeah, I'll see you then.
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

24:44.058 --> 24:46.233
You're not gonna take any notes?

24:47.099 --> 24:50.162
Oh, uh, you take notes for things

24:50.197 --> 24:53.116
you don't remember. I remember.

24:53.143 --> 24:55.510
I just think that since
we've been given another day

24:55.545 --> 24:58.667
to study for the test, we should use it.

24:58.703 --> 25:00.782
Look, even if
I thought that I needed to,

25:00.817 --> 25:04.285
which I don't, I don't have my textbook.

25:05.017 --> 25:06.717
Where is it?

25:06.752 --> 25:11.121
- I don't know.
- I must have left it somewhere.

25:16.662 --> 25:20.063
Excuse me, does anybody in here

25:20.099 --> 25:22.866
- drive a red SUV?
- Mine.

25:22.901 --> 25:26.169
- You're illegally parked.
- But I always park there.

25:26.205 --> 25:29.172
Then you've been doing it illegally.

25:29.208 --> 25:31.486
So I guess you want me to move
before you write me a ticket?

25:31.510 --> 25:33.577
I already gave you a ticket, ma'am.

25:33.612 --> 25:35.912
You're new here, aren't you?

25:35.948 --> 25:40.150
- It's my first week.
- Well, you're doing a fine job.

25:44.189 --> 25:48.725
You know, it's teenagers like that
you should really look out for.

25:50.162 --> 25:53.196
You never know what kind of
trouble they might get into.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.398
Seriously,

25:55.434 --> 25:56.747
you should really keep
an eye on those two.

25:56.771 --> 25:59.800
In case they end up somewhere
they shouldn't be.

26:12.985 --> 26:16.119
- Nice shot.
- You've gotten a lot better.

26:16.155 --> 26:18.121
It's not that complicated.

26:18.157 --> 26:21.625
You swing the mallet; you hit the ball.

26:21.660 --> 26:24.060
And then I get farther ahead of you.

26:24.096 --> 26:26.519
Well, I'll be way over there
trying to catch up.

26:29.862 --> 26:32.071
Ah. Hello.

26:32.106 --> 26:35.538
Hi. It's nice to see each of you
enjoying one more day in Middleton.

26:35.574 --> 26:38.039
Yeah, we figured we
might as well stick around and soak up

26:38.075 --> 26:39.317
some of the local flavor,

26:39.342 --> 26:41.589
since when are either of us going
to be back in this town again?

26:41.613 --> 26:44.815
We ran into each other at
Middleton Botanical Gardens

26:44.850 --> 26:46.961
and discovered we both shared
an interest in gardening.

26:46.985 --> 26:50.100
Who could have known the two
of us had so much in common?

26:50.989 --> 26:54.257
So you ended up enjoying
your days here, after all.

26:54.293 --> 26:57.427
Yeah. Grey House is really
starting to feel like home.

26:57.876 --> 27:00.438
"A radiant palace in the greenest

27:00.473 --> 27:03.834
of our valleys,
by good angels tenanted."

27:03.869 --> 27:06.336
- That's Edgar Allan Poe.
- The Haunted Palace.

27:06.371 --> 27:08.271
I've been doing a little reading.

27:08.903 --> 27:11.308
So, who's winning?

27:11.343 --> 27:13.559
Annabel is, by a mile.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.279
You've picked up that game so quickly.

27:16.315 --> 27:19.916
I've had a couple of days
with a pretty good teacher.

27:19.952 --> 27:23.247
Well, I will let you
get back to your lesson.

27:42.174 --> 27:45.809
- Sam, this place looks amazing!
- Yeah, it does look pretty great.

27:45.844 --> 27:48.545
But most of the credit
for that goes to Stephanie,

27:48.580 --> 27:51.181
- by the way.
- Ah, it was all

27:51.216 --> 27:53.617
Sam's idea. He's been
planning it all week.

27:53.652 --> 27:56.620
Is this what was taking up all your
time when I was trying to get together?

27:56.655 --> 28:00.323
- I've been busy, I know.
- Well, we're together now.

28:00.359 --> 28:03.874
Okay, sit. Sit. And I will go
get your first course.

28:04.529 --> 28:07.130
Everything is perfect.

28:07.165 --> 28:08.754
That was the idea.

28:09.167 --> 28:13.870
Oh. Hello. The invitation
said this is a dinner for two.

28:13.906 --> 28:16.339
- Invitation?
- From who?

28:16.375 --> 28:18.492
I don't know. It just said
I was supposed to be here.

28:18.517 --> 28:19.976
And me, too.

28:20.012 --> 28:23.380
I found this in my room.
I thought you had placed it there.

28:23.415 --> 28:25.479
Except I didn't.

28:25.909 --> 28:29.386
- Then who did?
- Jim. Annabel. You got my invitations.

28:29.421 --> 28:32.322
Except you're both just a tad early.

28:32.357 --> 28:34.441
Actually, they're not
supposed to be here at all.

28:34.466 --> 28:36.226
I set all this up for Cassie.

28:36.261 --> 28:39.573
I just thought the two of them
could enjoy a romantic evening

28:39.609 --> 28:42.399
together and then tomorrow
finally be on their way.

28:42.434 --> 28:45.535
Abigail, this is our romantic evening.

28:45.570 --> 28:48.085
So what should we do about that?

28:48.974 --> 28:51.374
Oh.

28:51.410 --> 28:54.010
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

28:54.046 --> 28:55.408
- Nick?
- Grace?

28:55.433 --> 28:56.879
- Where are you?
- What's going on?

28:56.915 --> 28:58.459
- City Hall?!
- Have you been arrested?

28:58.494 --> 29:00.917
- I'm on my way.
- Be right there.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.668
Oh, what a shame you're
missing your perfect evening.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.786
Okay, dinner is...

29:11.175 --> 29:12.673
What's going on?

29:12.709 --> 29:14.675
Sam and Cassie had to run.

29:14.711 --> 29:17.878
But we wouldn't want to let that
meal and such a romantic setting

29:17.914 --> 29:20.514
go to waste. Table for two?

29:23.386 --> 29:25.414
Well...

29:28.925 --> 29:31.692
Champagne?

29:31.728 --> 29:34.462
Yes, please.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.959
So you came here to study?

29:43.995 --> 29:47.109
Not to study, but to get
Grace's book so she could study.

29:47.144 --> 29:50.045
Look, Abigail told me
that Martha told her

29:50.080 --> 29:51.227
we could let ourselves in.

29:51.252 --> 29:52.948
- Abigail told you?
- Yes.

29:52.983 --> 29:54.975
I did say that, yes.
I just never imagined

29:55.000 --> 29:57.185
you'd show up quite so late at night.

29:57.221 --> 29:59.703
Because I thought we should study.

29:59.738 --> 30:02.836
There's an excuse I never thought
I'd hear. But I kind of like it.

30:02.860 --> 30:06.328
So this was just a big
misunderstanding. Officer Charles is new

30:06.363 --> 30:08.363
and he was just doing his job.

30:08.399 --> 30:10.699
I didn't think anyone was
supposed to be in here.

30:10.734 --> 30:12.427
And you did the right
thing, calling me...

30:12.452 --> 30:14.077
and having them call their parents.

30:14.112 --> 30:17.021
I'm so glad
you're being reasonable about this.

30:17.056 --> 30:19.552
I didn't want to get on your bad
side during my first week.

30:19.576 --> 30:21.855
You explained your reasoning;
why would there be a problem?

30:21.879 --> 30:25.647
- I just wasn't sure you'd hear me out.
- Why on earth not?

30:25.682 --> 30:27.975
Because I saw you this week,
talking to so many people,

30:28.011 --> 30:31.606
and it just didn't look like you
wanted to hear what they had to say.

30:33.056 --> 30:37.492
Martha was trying to convince people of a
proposal about something she believes in

30:37.528 --> 30:40.061
very much. Adjusting some speed limits.

30:40.097 --> 30:42.864
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Hm!

30:44.627 --> 30:47.862
Do you even know
why people are against it?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.310
That's funny. Your mother
asked me the same thing.

30:52.346 --> 30:54.843
But it seems like so many days ago.

30:54.878 --> 30:58.006
Well, maybe you can use
another day to find out.

31:06.306 --> 31:08.390
Did you do this?

31:08.425 --> 31:12.527
- No, I wish I would have.
- Welcome back.

31:12.563 --> 31:16.471
- Did you enjoy your date?
- It was actually a lot of fun.

31:16.507 --> 31:19.031
Well, I wanted to make your
return to Grey House as romantic

31:19.067 --> 31:21.520
as when the two of you
finally leave in the morning.

31:21.556 --> 31:25.140
- I've never seen so many flowers.
- Neither have I.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.285
Try living my life for a week.

31:29.012 --> 31:32.395
Aww... And just think, if the two of you

31:32.430 --> 31:34.961
hadn't been up for the same job,
you'd never even would have met.

31:34.985 --> 31:37.817
That's true.
I guess we'll have to figure out

31:37.842 --> 31:39.588
what happens when
one of us gets the job.

31:39.623 --> 31:41.800
- It'll be okay.
- You'll figure something out.

31:44.628 --> 31:47.208
- I'll figure something out?
- I just meant...

31:47.243 --> 31:48.830
There's no part of you that believes

31:48.855 --> 31:50.590
that I'm gonna get this
job instead of you, is there?

31:50.614 --> 31:53.702
No, I mean, it's
possible, it's just... I'm the one

31:53.737 --> 31:54.924
with the unique perspective.

31:54.949 --> 31:57.605
Which you'reconvinced is so
much better than mine.

31:57.641 --> 32:01.943
Whoa. What we have here
is a sea of flowers

32:01.979 --> 32:05.514
and a romantic evening that we
don't want to see go to waste.

32:06.536 --> 32:09.484
I'll tell you what was
a waste: this entire day,

32:09.520 --> 32:11.029
and then coming home with you.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.688
It's a good thing we never have
to see each other again.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.542
That's the best news
I've heard all week.

32:20.497 --> 32:23.133
Why did I even open
a stupid flower shop?

32:28.472 --> 32:31.873
- Well, I'm sorry about all this.
- About what?

32:31.909 --> 32:34.209
This is not exactly the way
I wanted our date to end.

32:34.244 --> 32:37.379
You're not gonna get any
complaints from me. I got ice cream.

32:37.414 --> 32:40.115
I just wanted everything to be perfect.

32:40.150 --> 32:42.984
ice cream.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.854
But we didn't even have
dinner, you hardly got to hear

32:45.889 --> 32:48.418
the string quartet, and
you barely even got a look

32:48.454 --> 32:51.726
at all those flowers that
I ordered especially for you.

32:51.762 --> 32:54.099
I did notice that you
got all my favorite kinds,

32:54.124 --> 32:56.906
and I appreciate all the trouble
you went through.

32:56.942 --> 32:59.045
And for what?
End up sitting in the back of a car

32:59.069 --> 33:01.136
eating ice cream? Not much of a date.

33:01.171 --> 33:04.508
- I don't know.
- It seems pretty perfect.

33:08.472 --> 33:12.107
You're right. It is perfect.

33:13.850 --> 33:16.918
- You know what else is perfect?
- What?

33:16.954 --> 33:18.653
The detailing job on this car.

33:18.689 --> 33:21.222
Come on, it doesn't get
any better than this.

33:21.258 --> 33:22.367
I dripped ice cream on it.

33:22.392 --> 33:25.427
What? Oh, now the date really is ruined.

33:48.251 --> 33:50.762
Good morning.

33:51.521 --> 33:54.855
- There's tea for you.
- Thanks.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.494
- Good morning, Annabel.
- Good morning. So,

33:59.529 --> 34:01.296
I just got a text from the company.

34:01.321 --> 34:03.042
They've decided who they're
giving the job to

34:03.066 --> 34:04.943
and they're announcing it later today.

34:06.003 --> 34:09.270
Huh! I'm gonna want
to stick around to hear that.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.534
Me, too. That is,
if you still have room.

34:13.143 --> 34:16.543
- I still have room.
- For one more day.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.083
Come on in.

34:22.119 --> 34:25.085
I've been on hold with the
flower delivery company for...

34:25.121 --> 34:29.090
hours. Stop sending me carnations!

34:30.260 --> 34:32.460
Just help yourself to whatever you want.

34:35.728 --> 34:39.501
I'm looking for the most
extravagant bouquet you have.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.636
So you can convince someone
of something else?

34:41.672 --> 34:45.139
As a reminder to myself
of this week's follies.

34:45.175 --> 34:47.141
It was brought to my attention

34:47.177 --> 34:50.011
that if I perhaps were
to listen to people more

34:50.047 --> 34:53.447
instead of talking so much, I might
actually get more of what I want.

34:53.483 --> 34:56.685
I can't believe that
it took me an entire week

34:56.719 --> 34:59.120
to realize such a basic
lesson in communication.

34:59.156 --> 35:01.469
I guess some of us are slow learners.

35:01.504 --> 35:04.859
Mmhmm. Here we go again.

35:05.849 --> 35:10.965
Go ahead, bring them in, dump them
wherever you want. - Oh, no, no, no.

35:11.001 --> 35:14.035
I could never just dump these.
These are beauty in a box, right here.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.504
It's merchandise I need
to get out the door.

35:16.540 --> 35:19.140
- Are you kidding?
- It's a lot more than that.

35:19.176 --> 35:21.008
Do you ever get to see
the expression on the faces

35:21.032 --> 35:22.977
of the people that get these flowers?

35:23.013 --> 35:25.780
Sometimes. When I'm not
stuck inside my store.

35:25.816 --> 35:28.283
Then maybe you need to get out more.

35:28.318 --> 35:31.152
He's right. Your flowers and chocolates

35:31.188 --> 35:34.355
brightened up the face of every
person I handed them to.

35:34.391 --> 35:36.691
So it's a good thing
you opened your store

35:36.727 --> 35:39.371
right where you did
and right when you did it.

35:43.249 --> 35:45.460
Yeah, I guess you're right.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.573
Let me get your signature

35:51.608 --> 35:54.409
right here for all these carnations.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.638
I'd be happy to.

35:58.452 --> 36:00.212
Glad to see that finger
didn't run out of ink.

36:00.236 --> 36:02.352
Yeah.

36:02.753 --> 36:05.606
So, I guess I'll see you
same time tomorrow.

36:05.642 --> 36:08.233
- You got it.
- You're on my schedule.

36:11.695 --> 36:15.396
Um, well, you were on my schedule.

36:15.432 --> 36:17.565
I guess they finally got
things straightened out.

36:17.601 --> 36:19.505
So tomorrow might finally be

36:19.540 --> 36:20.870
a brand new day.

36:22.239 --> 36:24.672
Try not to miss us too much.

36:24.708 --> 36:27.085
By the way, your clock is fast.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.818
- What are you studying?
- Uh, math.

37:02.854 --> 37:06.188
- I have a test next week.
- Aren't you already good at math?

37:06.224 --> 37:10.026
Yes, and I thought that
I was good at history,

37:10.061 --> 37:12.862
but it turns out you actually
have to keep studying history

37:12.897 --> 37:15.097
in order to stay good at history.

37:15.133 --> 37:19.068
Did you finally take that test
that kept getting postponed?

37:19.103 --> 37:20.748
We did.

37:20.784 --> 37:22.938
I got a B.

37:22.974 --> 37:27.843
- I thought B's were supposed to be good?
- Not as good as A's.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.214
Guess who got an A on his history test?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.235
The extra credit put me over the top.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.186
Congratulations.

37:37.221 --> 37:40.289
You deserve it, after
all the work that you did.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.725
How'd you do?

37:42.760 --> 37:46.595
Oh, I did okay... But I'm
going to do better next time.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.398
If you want, I can help you study.

37:50.353 --> 37:53.936
You know what? I could
actually use the help.

37:53.971 --> 37:58.908
Okay, but you're gonna have to explain
it all to me first. I stink at math.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.374
You look like a man

38:07.410 --> 38:09.648
- who just got a job offer.
- I did.

38:09.683 --> 38:12.288
Just not the one I interviewed for.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.958
They went with someone who they
said is more right for this job,

38:14.994 --> 38:16.870
but then offered me something
even better in Seattle,

38:16.894 --> 38:20.830
- where they're opening up a new branch.
- Seattle is a beautiful city.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.358
I've kind of always
wanted to live there.

38:22.382 --> 38:23.966
Hm.

38:24.001 --> 38:26.836
And I hear congratulations are in order.

38:26.871 --> 38:30.639
- I guess so, yeah.
- I'm really happy for you.

38:30.675 --> 38:34.276
- They made an excellent choice.
- Thanks.

38:35.546 --> 38:38.441
- Except I turned them down.
- What?

38:38.476 --> 38:41.450
- Why?
- I took the interview

38:41.486 --> 38:44.787
because I wanted to find out if there
was something better out there for me.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.491
And I realized I kind of like the job

38:46.527 --> 38:47.621
I already have.

38:48.427 --> 38:51.527
And then I found a book
in your library about Seattle

38:51.562 --> 38:55.297
and it just made me realize I didn't
want to leave my friends back home.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.569
You're from Seattle?

38:58.536 --> 39:02.304
- Annabel's whole family's from there.
- And now Jim is moving there as well.

39:02.340 --> 39:06.442
- For a job, yeah.
- Maybe I can show you around.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.611
I'd really like that.

39:09.814 --> 39:12.815
I just want to thank you
for these wonderful days

39:12.850 --> 39:15.462
at Grey House. It got to the point
where I didn't want them to end.

39:15.486 --> 39:17.714
Well, I'm glad you had a pleasant stay.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.300
And you're going to have
to let me know where to get

39:20.324 --> 39:22.336
- that tea I've been loving.
- I wanted to ask that, too.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.326
It's from the Skagit Valley.

39:24.804 --> 39:27.229
That's not too far from Seattle.

39:27.265 --> 39:31.060
Mm-hmm. I hear it's a lovely
place to spend a couple of days.

39:42.171 --> 39:45.139
- Hey.
- Hey. How was your day?

39:45.174 --> 39:47.108
Well, I made it through

39:47.143 --> 39:49.810
without having to pick up my kid
for breaking into City Hall.

39:49.846 --> 39:53.180
We are raising such delinquents.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.792
I'm glad you came by.
Aside from last night,

39:55.817 --> 39:57.162
I feel like I haven't seen you all week.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.353
That's kind of true.

39:59.756 --> 40:03.057
I guess I got so busy
trying to plan our perfect date,

40:03.092 --> 40:05.793
we could have just cancelled it
and spent time together.

40:05.828 --> 40:09.497
- With no plans at all.
- I'm just not that kind of guy.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.810
I like to know how things are
gonna end before I start them.

40:11.834 --> 40:14.092
Where's the mystery in that?

40:14.117 --> 40:16.137
I like to think of it as being prepared.

40:16.172 --> 40:19.507
You can't go into surgery without
knowing exactly what you're gonna do.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.143
Well, it's a good thing
I don't need a surgeon.

40:25.907 --> 40:30.418
I just wanted you to know
how much I care about you.

40:31.613 --> 40:34.581
Well, if that's what it takes,
then you can keep on doing that.

40:34.783 --> 40:37.885
But I'm letting you know
that you don't have to.

40:38.920 --> 40:40.861
What if I want to?

40:41.297 --> 40:45.032
I'll never turn down flowers
and a string quartet.

40:53.976 --> 40:56.610
When did that clock start working?

40:56.646 --> 40:59.613
Oh, it's been keeping good
time for a couple of days.

41:02.765 --> 41:06.454
So, you got any plans tonight?

41:06.489 --> 41:08.889
No. You?

41:08.925 --> 41:10.758
Nope. None.
