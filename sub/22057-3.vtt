Still debating the best place
on the island to get a manicure.

A manicure?

listening to mob guys

01:10.553 --> 01:12.620
eating takeout

01:12.622 --> 01:14.956

Thanks, man.

Must be my soy cappuccino.

DANNY:
Well, now that we

02:50.620 --> 02:53.187
are all thoroughly disgusted,
you and I

02:53.189 --> 02:55.890
have to discuss
fabrics.

02:55.892 --> 02:57.892
Fabric?
Yeah, fabrics.

02:57.894 --> 02:59.694
We, uh, still haven't
looked at the swatches.

02:59.696 --> 03:02.430
You haven't looked at the
swatches for the booths.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.766
Okay. I don't, uh...

03:05.768 --> 03:07.235
I'm sorry.
I don't see any...

03:07.237 --> 03:08.302
They all look
the same to me, Danny.

03:08.304 --> 03:10.171
Right. To your untrained,
ignorant eye,

03:10.173 --> 03:12.640
they would all look like red,
but they are not.

03:12.642 --> 03:15.009
See, this one, this beautiful
one right here, is Garnet.

03:15.011 --> 03:17.044
This is Currant,
and this is, uh, Blood,

03:17.046 --> 03:18.880
which I'm guessing you'll pick.

03:19.749 --> 03:21.682
Okay. I-I have another
suggestion, if I...

03:21.684 --> 03:23.317
May I?
Sure.

03:23.319 --> 03:24.552
Thank you.
I was just thinking

03:24.554 --> 03:26.220
maybe the booth section--

03:26.222 --> 03:28.289
we could maybe go black.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.025
What? No.

03:31.027 --> 03:32.260
No, we can't do that.

03:32.262 --> 03:34.128
It's a... it's an
Italian restaurant.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.997
We can't have a black booth.
It's gotta be red.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.098
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.199
I already ordered
the Garnet.

03:38.201 --> 03:39.567
You ordered it?

03:39.569 --> 03:40.801
Sort of.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.236
Ah.
Yo!

03:42.238 --> 03:44.038
You boys are focusing

03:44.040 --> 03:45.773
on the wrong
thing entirely.

03:45.775 --> 03:47.275
Ain't going to matter

03:47.277 --> 03:48.943
what it looks like if you
can't get nobody inside.

03:48.945 --> 03:51.712
- Huh?
- This dining and hospitality business

03:51.714 --> 03:53.314
is all about marketing.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.149
You fellas need a brand.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.286
With that in mind,
I had my guy whip this up.

04:08.531 --> 04:10.698

shirt so much.

04:15.371 --> 04:16.870
(clicks tongue)
Well, you got a problem,

04:16.873 --> 04:18.372
'cause I ordered 400 of these,

04:18.374 --> 04:19.940

work cheap.

04:19.942 --> 04:22.677
Kamekona, thank you for...

04:22.679 --> 04:23.878
for trying to help.
Appreciate it,

04:23.880 --> 04:25.479
but this is gonna be...
it's gonna be

04:25.481 --> 04:27.181
a different kind
of establishment than the one

04:27.183 --> 04:29.450
you're used to running, you know?
That's correct. That's correct.

04:29.452 --> 04:31.152
You see, because we're
going to have plates

04:31.154 --> 04:32.587
and we're going to have
silverware.

04:32.589 --> 04:33.988
Okay, and we're
gonna have a kitchen

04:33.990 --> 04:35.323
that can pass a
health-code inspection.

04:35.325 --> 04:36.457
(cell phone ringing)

04:36.459 --> 04:38.259
Right, all that kind of stuff.

04:38.261 --> 04:39.994
Hey, if that's...
if that's the landlord,

04:39.996 --> 04:41.395
please tell him
that I put the check

04:41.397 --> 04:43.230
in the mail.
Did you?

04:43.232 --> 04:45.066
I did not.

04:45.902 --> 04:47.234
STEVE:
Hello.

04:47.236 --> 04:49.303
Hey. Yeah,
what's going on, man?

04:49.305 --> 04:51.138
No, no, no.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.239
He's right here. Look,

04:52.241 --> 04:53.641
I'll go get cleaned up,
I'll grab Danny,

04:53.643 --> 04:55.409
and we'll come and, uh...
we'll check you out in a bit.

04:55.411 --> 04:56.777
All right, bye-bye.

04:56.779 --> 04:57.745
Huh.

04:57.747 --> 04:59.413
Landlord wants to hang out?

04:59.415 --> 05:01.716
You're not gonna believe
who's in town.

05:04.887 --> 05:05.953
Hey.

05:05.955 --> 05:07.655
Harry Langford.
Hello, chaps.

05:07.657 --> 05:09.023
Hey, buddy.

05:09.025 --> 05:10.491
Those are short shorts, babe.

05:10.493 --> 05:11.726
Look like Daisy Dukes.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.929
DANNY: We could get him
for indecent exposure.

05:14.931 --> 05:17.264
Lovely to see you.
Okay, okay.

05:17.266 --> 05:18.833
It's a hug. Look at that.

05:18.835 --> 05:20.134
Don't need
a towel now, do you?

05:20.136 --> 05:22.236
I'm good. I'm gonna take
a handshake today.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.171
What are you doing
here? Has MI6

05:24.173 --> 05:26.407
got some business in Hawaii
that we should know about?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.575
Well, I wouldn't know,

05:27.577 --> 05:29.276
seeing as I'm no longer
with the service.

05:29.278 --> 05:30.311
DANNY:
What happened?

05:30.313 --> 05:31.812
I've taken an
early pension,

05:31.814 --> 05:35.182
and, um, I'm traveling the world
enjoying my golden years.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.486
Golden years? What are
you, 43 years old?

05:38.488 --> 05:41.288
45, which is not exactly young
in my line of work.

05:41.290 --> 05:42.523
DANNY: I would love
nothing more

05:42.525 --> 05:44.358
than to travel the world,
but I don't think

05:44.360 --> 05:46.360
I'd get very far
on a cop's pension, you know.

05:46.362 --> 05:47.962
Well, to be fair,
I have been supplementing

05:47.964 --> 05:50.064
my retirement fund
with regular wins

05:50.066 --> 05:52.199
at the high-stakes poker
and baccarat tables.

05:52.201 --> 05:54.201
Is that right? It's
interesting you mention it.

05:54.203 --> 05:55.703
Danny and I have got
this sure-fire

05:55.705 --> 05:57.071
business venture, uh,
for when we retire.

05:57.073 --> 05:58.873
We're working on it
right now on the side.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.174
Oh.
Yeah.

06:00.176 --> 06:01.609
Well, so long as it's
not a restaurant,

06:01.611 --> 06:04.478
you should be fine.
Okay. Thanks.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.682
Well, if anyone can
make it work...

06:08.985 --> 06:10.584
DANNY: I don't want
to be inappropriate,

06:10.586 --> 06:12.553
but that girl's so pretty
it's-it's painful.

06:12.555 --> 06:14.221
Oh, my God.

06:16.559 --> 06:18.492
HARRY: Mmm.
DANNY: Oh.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.263
Gentlemen, this is Veronique.

06:22.265 --> 06:23.597
We met in Monte Carlo.

06:23.599 --> 06:25.099
Her full house beat my flush.

06:25.101 --> 06:28.335
But you made it up to me,
didn't you, darling?

06:29.839 --> 06:32.373
Hello.
You must be Steven and Daniel.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.608
Harry's told me
so much about you.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.410
Hope you can join
us for lunch.

06:36.412 --> 06:38.534
DANNY: Yeah, I'll do
lunch here at the hotel.

06:38.558 --> 06:39.147
STEVE: Yeah. Absolutely.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.848
I like the hotel food here.
Yeah, that would be, uh...

06:40.850 --> 06:41.982
that would be...
that would be lovely,

06:41.984 --> 06:43.017
right after I take this call.

06:43.019 --> 06:44.351
Don't, uh, forget
what I said, please.

06:44.353 --> 06:45.853
Yeah, yeah.
Check's in the mail, all right?

06:45.855 --> 06:47.088
Yeah.
McGarrett.

06:51.027 --> 06:52.960
Yeah.
All right, we're on the way.

06:52.962 --> 06:54.829
(camera shutter clicking)

06:56.065 --> 06:57.198
What do you got, Lou?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.266
Guy in the big-boy chair
was Jimmy Okada,

06:59.268 --> 07:01.736
head of the Okada crime family.

07:01.738 --> 07:03.604
Shot dead 2:00 a.m.
this morning, along with

07:03.606 --> 07:05.106
nine members
of his organization.

07:05.108 --> 07:07.942
Okada himself
was the subject

07:07.944 --> 07:09.410
of an ongoing
FBI investigation.

07:09.412 --> 07:11.579
As a matter of fact,
the Feds

07:11.581 --> 07:13.848
had a surveillance
team listening in

07:13.850 --> 07:15.282
on this very
room last night.

07:15.284 --> 07:17.451
When this went down?
That's right.

07:17.453 --> 07:21.155
New girl's out there getting
the lowdown from the Feds.

07:22.058 --> 07:23.257
Hi.

07:23.259 --> 07:24.525
You're really hitting
the ground running, huh?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.893
Yeah. What can I say?
I'm a self-starter.

07:25.895 --> 07:26.927
STEVE: Yeah, we
gathered that.

07:26.929 --> 07:29.130
Badge looks good.
Thank you.

07:29.132 --> 07:31.866
So, our friends from
the Bureau had a rough night.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.034
This whole bloodbath happened
right under their noses.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.302
Right. Where were they?

07:35.304 --> 07:36.670
They were right outside.

07:36.672 --> 07:38.706
The shooters managed
to barricade them

07:38.708 --> 07:39.974
inside their own
surveillance van.

07:39.976 --> 07:41.442
They got in and out of here

07:41.444 --> 07:42.476
without ever
being seen.

07:42.478 --> 07:43.944
They said that there's

07:43.946 --> 07:45.546
an emergency exit
in the corridor,

07:45.548 --> 07:48.315
so best bet says
that's the entry point.

07:48.317 --> 07:50.985
This Okada, he's like a...
like a big-shot guy, right?

07:50.987 --> 07:52.219
GROVER:
He was known as

07:52.221 --> 07:53.454
Mr. Untouchable.

07:53.456 --> 07:54.522
Definitely gonna
be some blowback.

07:54.524 --> 07:55.723
STEVE:
Yeah, whoever did this

07:55.725 --> 07:57.424
just started a war.

08:06.179 --> 08:07.886
[]PROSECUTOR:
You are Benjiro Okada,

08:08.286 --> 08:09.986
otherwise known as Jimmy Okada?

08:11.089 --> 08:13.289
If you need help with my name,

08:13.291 --> 08:15.892
then this is a waste
of everyone's time.

08:15.894 --> 08:17.593
Do you deny that you are

08:17.595 --> 08:19.829
the de facto head
of the Okada syndicate,

08:19.831 --> 08:21.864
that you were
the ultimate authority

08:21.866 --> 08:23.933
behind the murders
of Makoto Fukuhara

08:23.935 --> 08:26.068
and Riku Kuroda, and...

08:26.070 --> 08:28.604
TANI: The deposition lasts
another two hours,

08:28.606 --> 08:30.873
and Okada doesn't
say another word.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.743
Okay, this is, uh,
three years ago.

08:33.745 --> 08:35.678
He, uh... he didn't do
any time, right?

08:35.679 --> 08:37.580
The jury failed to reach
a verdict, so the Feds

08:37.582 --> 08:39.315
had to start from scratch,
build a new case.

08:39.317 --> 08:41.683
All right, look, maybe Okada
got what was coming to him,

08:41.686 --> 08:43.953
but we need to end this before
the violence escalates, right?

08:43.955 --> 08:46.355
Which means we need to figure
out who was behind this hit.

08:46.357 --> 08:48.090
Well, I reached out to CIU.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.726
As you can imagine, there's
a long list of rival gangs

08:50.728 --> 08:53.095
who would love to take
Okada out of the mix.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.298
Unfortunately,
up until now, nobody's had

08:55.300 --> 08:58.601
the muscle or the <i>pelotas</i>
to make it happen.

08:58.603 --> 09:00.536
Well, they certainly
picked the right time.

09:00.538 --> 09:03.639
Those Feds I was talking to
said that Okada usually rolls

09:03.641 --> 09:05.041
with four or five
extra guns,

09:05.043 --> 09:06.776
so the security detail
was light last night.

09:06.778 --> 09:08.344
Jerry, you all right?
What's going on?

09:08.346 --> 09:09.679
(panting):
News. Excited.

09:09.681 --> 09:11.013
I ran up the stairs.

09:11.015 --> 09:12.281
I think I figured out

09:12.283 --> 09:15.051
how the shooters knew
when to hit Okada.

09:15.053 --> 09:17.119
All right.
I spoke to HPD,

09:17.121 --> 09:18.454
and all the witnesses and staff

09:18.456 --> 09:21.123
have been accounted for
except for...

09:21.993 --> 09:23.593
Annie Hughes.
She's a waitress

09:23.595 --> 09:25.394
who served
Okada's crew last night.

09:25.396 --> 09:27.496
<i>And, according to her manager,</i>
<i>she was last seen</i>

09:27.498 --> 09:28.698
five minutes
before the shooting.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.333
Her cell's going
to voice mail.

09:30.335 --> 09:32.034
HPD went by her house,
and Nada.

09:32.036 --> 09:33.269
DANNY:
So, what, you think

09:33.271 --> 09:34.870
she tipped off the shooter?

09:34.872 --> 09:36.105
Well, her going AWOL

09:36.107 --> 09:37.840
does seem like a really big
coincidence otherwise,

09:37.842 --> 09:39.475
and you know my feelings
about coincidences.

09:39.477 --> 09:41.577
Well, that explains
how they got in and out

09:41.579 --> 09:43.079
through the emergency exit.

09:43.081 --> 09:44.246
We need to track down Annie.

09:44.248 --> 09:45.915
Jerry, do me a favor--
stay on that.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.950
In the meantime,
the rest of us need to see

09:47.952 --> 09:50.086
if there's anybody
inside Okada's organization

09:50.088 --> 09:51.554
that could have been
looking for retribution.

09:51.556 --> 09:52.922
TANI:
Okada had a son,

09:52.924 --> 09:54.423
Derek.

09:54.425 --> 09:55.658
That's good.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.560
Lou, look into that.
Take Tani with, all right?

09:57.562 --> 09:58.794
Danny and I
will look into

09:58.796 --> 10:00.029
any rival crews
who could've had

10:00.031 --> 10:02.031
the resources to pull
something like this off.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.733
Let's get it, rook.

10:03.735 --> 10:05.301
All I'm saying

10:05.303 --> 10:10.239
is that... is that red,
it's a little cliché.

10:10.241 --> 10:12.108
You're a little cliché.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.542
Sick burn, buddy.

10:13.544 --> 10:15.344
Good job.
(elevator bell dings)

10:17.248 --> 10:18.914
Hello, chaps.

10:18.916 --> 10:21.017
Catch you at a bad time?

10:21.019 --> 10:23.019
No... Wait a minute.
How did you get

10:23.021 --> 10:24.120
past security downstairs?

10:24.122 --> 10:25.388
Uh, don't...
I don't want to know.

10:25.390 --> 10:26.422
Actually, don't tell me.

10:26.424 --> 10:28.758
Uh, where's, uh...
Veronique?

10:28.760 --> 10:30.292
And more important,
why aren't you,

10:30.294 --> 10:31.527
uh, with her right now?

10:31.529 --> 10:33.829
Turns out you can have
too much of a good thing.

10:33.831 --> 10:35.731
I'm beginning to
suspect that...

10:35.733 --> 10:38.067
my retirement may have
been a little premature.

10:38.069 --> 10:40.503
That's interesting.
Are you paying attention?

10:40.505 --> 10:41.671
I'd like to hear. Yeah, please.
Go on.

10:41.673 --> 10:43.172
HARRY: Well, I've got
to tell you,

10:43.174 --> 10:45.007
it's not all it's
cracked up to be,

10:45.009 --> 10:47.309
traveling the world
in private jets,

10:47.311 --> 10:49.512
the soulless luxury

10:49.514 --> 10:52.481
of five-star hotels,
endless cocktail parties,

10:52.483 --> 10:55.918
making banal small talk
with beautiful models.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.787
It's... it sounds great,

10:57.789 --> 11:00.089
but in the end,

11:00.091 --> 11:02.258
it starts to wear thin.
Yeah, I can imagine.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.294
Must be tough. I don't know
how you made it through.

11:05.296 --> 11:07.596
They should give you
another medal or something.

11:07.598 --> 11:09.498
What are you boys up to anyway?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.333
We're working. Got a case.
Wonderful.

11:11.335 --> 11:14.603
You see, I had this random
idea that I might tag along.

11:14.605 --> 11:16.872
Lend a hand, so to speak.
Okay, just...

11:16.874 --> 11:18.140
uh, let me get this straight.

11:18.142 --> 11:20.576
You're going to swap
a cabana at the Kahala

11:20.578 --> 11:22.878
with Veronique,
uh, for a backseat

11:22.880 --> 11:25.981
in this guy's Camaro
with us? Is that right?

11:27.819 --> 11:30.686
If you'll have me.

11:34.459 --> 11:36.592
Look, I know my father
had a lot of enemies,

11:36.594 --> 11:38.094
but I couldn't tell you
their names.

11:38.096 --> 11:39.795
See, he never
involved me

11:39.797 --> 11:42.465
in his business.

11:42.467 --> 11:45.000
Never wanted
that life for me.

11:45.803 --> 11:48.037
I will tell you
this, though.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.841
If I do find out
who was behind this...

11:51.843 --> 11:55.811
Then you'll be putting in a call
to us so we can deal with it.

11:55.813 --> 11:56.779
Something like that.

11:56.781 --> 11:58.247
I'm afraid
it's gonna have to be

11:58.249 --> 12:00.382
exactly like that,
Mr. Okada.

12:00.384 --> 12:02.017
We're not just protecting you
from the others.

12:02.019 --> 12:04.019
We're protecting you
from yourself.

12:04.021 --> 12:06.188
We'll see ourselves out.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.533
Redecorating, are we?

12:17.535 --> 12:19.535
STEVE: Oh, no,
we're, uh...

12:19.537 --> 12:20.770
going through
some fabric choices

12:20.772 --> 12:22.271
for the booths
in our new restaurant.

12:22.273 --> 12:24.140
Danny's dead set on red.
I'm not so sure.

12:24.142 --> 12:25.307
Well, if you take my advice,

12:25.309 --> 12:26.776
you should go
with a neutral color.

12:26.778 --> 12:28.310
Huh.
Plain as possible.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.513
- Why is that?
- So, when the restaurant goes under,

12:30.515 --> 12:32.214
they'll be easier
to liquidate at auction.

12:32.216 --> 12:34.717
Damn. Thanks for the vote
of confidence, buddy.

12:34.719 --> 12:36.919
Anytime, mate.

12:37.989 --> 12:39.622
HARRY:
So...

12:39.624 --> 12:41.323
who's this bloke
we're going to see?

12:41.325 --> 12:42.525
He's our CI.

12:42.527 --> 12:44.493
Hey.

12:44.495 --> 12:45.961
You have lunch yet?

12:45.963 --> 12:49.698
KAMEKONA: Look who came
crawling back.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.100
DANNY:
No. Yes.

12:51.102 --> 12:52.802
But not for the
restaurant, okay?

12:52.804 --> 12:55.337
Somebody took out Jimmy Okada.

12:55.339 --> 12:58.140
We figured you might
know which outfit

12:58.142 --> 13:00.342
could pull off a hit like that.

13:01.445 --> 13:04.013
Wow, that's a big play.

13:04.015 --> 13:05.581
I haven't heard nothing.

13:05.583 --> 13:09.051
But it won't be too long
until we all hear about this.

13:09.053 --> 13:11.453
Taking out a big fish
like Okada

13:11.455 --> 13:13.122
is just the first step

13:13.124 --> 13:16.025
in a hostile takeover
of his turf.

13:16.027 --> 13:18.127
This situation
is going to escalate.

13:18.129 --> 13:20.029
Anyone can kill the king.

13:20.031 --> 13:22.298
Reigning in his place
is another thing entirely.

13:24.168 --> 13:28.337
I don't know who you are,
but that's, like...

13:28.339 --> 13:30.072
really profound.

13:30.074 --> 13:33.542
STEVE: Kamekona, this is our
friend, Harry Langford.

13:34.445 --> 13:36.278
He's, uh...
he's British.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.013
That's why you can't
understand anything he says.

13:38.015 --> 13:39.315
He talks funny.

13:39.317 --> 13:41.016
Excellent shrimp,
by the way.

13:41.018 --> 13:42.718
Please give my
compliments to the chef.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.688
You can tell him yourself.
You're looking at him.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.223
You made this?

13:47.225 --> 13:49.191
With these hands.
Well, that's remarkable.

13:49.193 --> 13:50.926
I've gotta tell you,
big lad,

13:50.928 --> 13:52.795
when they told me
I'd be eating shrimp

13:52.797 --> 13:55.564
made in the back of a truck,
my expectations were not high,

13:55.566 --> 13:57.600
but this shellfish is yummy.

13:59.003 --> 14:00.236
And I can get away

14:00.238 --> 14:01.637
with saying “yummy”,
because I'm British.

14:01.639 --> 14:03.072
DANNY:
Okay, can we get back

14:03.074 --> 14:05.341
to why we're here, please?
KAMEKONA: Why's that again?

14:05.343 --> 14:07.910
Oh, yeah. The Okada hit.

14:07.912 --> 14:10.613
Like I said, I can't put
one particular crew

14:10.615 --> 14:12.615
in the frame on this.

14:12.617 --> 14:13.983
But whoever they are,

14:13.985 --> 14:15.818
I know one thing.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.987
The street war
that they just started--

14:17.989 --> 14:19.788
they're going to need
a lot of firepower.

14:19.790 --> 14:23.058
And if I'm in the market
for that kind of iron...

14:23.060 --> 14:25.861
Loto Manui--
he's the go-to guy

14:25.863 --> 14:27.897
for all the gangs
looking to tool up.

14:27.899 --> 14:30.633
DANNY: So, if this “Loto”
is the guy to go to

14:30.635 --> 14:32.968
for guns, how come
I never heard of him?

14:32.970 --> 14:35.237
He knows all the names
and faces of every cop

14:35.239 --> 14:36.872
on the island,
so good luck

14:36.874 --> 14:40.342
getting within
a hundred feet of him.

14:44.348 --> 14:45.481
What?

14:45.483 --> 14:49.618
♪ Everybody does it
in Hawaii... ♪

14:49.620 --> 14:51.553
Afternoon, everyone.

14:51.555 --> 14:54.423
I'll take
the house Mai tai.

14:55.226 --> 14:57.326
In a clean glass,
if you have one.

14:57.328 --> 15:00.729

15:00.731 --> 15:04.266

how to squeeze... ♪

15:04.268 --> 15:06.168
You on your own?

15:06.170 --> 15:07.569
Actually, I'm here
to meet someone.

15:07.571 --> 15:09.505
They should be
along any minute.

15:09.507 --> 15:11.674
Buy you a drink
while you wait?

15:11.676 --> 15:13.742
Well, that's really
lovely of you to offer,

15:13.744 --> 15:16.278
but I've just ordered one.

15:19.517 --> 15:21.283
Mahalo.

15:22.586 --> 15:24.753
(slurping through straw)

15:25.823 --> 15:28.991
(sound of slurping through straw
plays over speakers)

15:28.993 --> 15:30.359
This is going swimmingly.

15:30.361 --> 15:33.896
Look, he knows what
he's doing, all right?

15:33.898 --> 15:35.731
I think.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.003
STEVE:
Check this out.

15:46.377 --> 15:47.843
All right, that's...
that's Loto.

15:47.845 --> 15:49.812
That's a lot of muscle
he's with.

15:49.814 --> 15:51.180
You sure this guy can handle it?

15:51.182 --> 15:52.915
STEVE: You've seen him do his thing.
He's a pro.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.116
DANNY:
No, he was a pro.

15:54.118 --> 15:55.484
Okay? He's been gambling

15:55.486 --> 15:57.820
and dating models
for who knows how long,

15:57.822 --> 16:00.522
and maybe he got
a little rusty, okay?

16:03.594 --> 16:05.127
You Langford?

16:05.129 --> 16:06.762
Mr. Manui.

16:06.764 --> 16:08.764
Can I buy you a drink?

16:11.702 --> 16:14.169
Thank you for
meeting me.

16:14.171 --> 16:16.972
I've already decided
I don't like you,

16:16.974 --> 16:19.341
so you can lose
the nice-guy act.

16:19.343 --> 16:21.276
Seems a bit
harsh, but okay.

16:21.278 --> 16:23.746
I'm here because you know
someone who knows me.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.781
That gets you a sit-down.

16:25.783 --> 16:28.117
Want me to stay,
talk business.

16:28.119 --> 16:30.819
Better come up
with a good reason.

16:34.492 --> 16:37.092
Is that reason enough?

16:51.942 --> 16:54.276
Fully functional,
of course?

16:55.112 --> 16:56.712
Sure.

17:00.418 --> 17:03.419
I usually like to
try before I buy.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.496
(chuckles softly)

17:14.498 --> 17:18.099
Step into my office,
Mr. Langford.

17:22.873 --> 17:25.107
Now, this is
more like it.

17:33.384 --> 17:34.616
(engine starting)

17:34.618 --> 17:36.018
Whoa. That's not
part of the plan.

17:36.020 --> 17:38.253
No, it's not part
of the plan.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.660
(tires squealing)

17:44.662 --> 17:47.529
Let me guess-- we're just going
for a little ride.

17:47.531 --> 17:50.165
Somewhere nice and quiet
where you can dump my body.

17:50.167 --> 17:53.035
(grunting and groaning)

17:59.477 --> 18:00.876
(gunshots)
Oh!

18:00.878 --> 18:02.878
Is that gunfire coming out
of the back of the truck?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.346
Yeah, it's gunfire.
What... Of course it is.

18:04.348 --> 18:05.681
I told you he was rusty.

18:06.517 --> 18:08.117
(groaning)

18:22.066 --> 18:24.266
(tires screeching)

18:34.545 --> 18:36.445
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?

18:36.447 --> 18:37.646
You all right?

18:37.648 --> 18:38.780
Never better.

18:38.782 --> 18:40.883
Hey, uh, uh, English,
if you... if you crush

18:40.885 --> 18:42.451
his windpipe, he won't
be able to talk.

18:42.453 --> 18:44.486
We gotta ask him
questions, you see.

18:44.488 --> 18:45.854
Huh.

18:45.856 --> 18:47.456
Mr. Manui.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.159
Are you ready to talk?
(yells)

18:50.161 --> 18:52.494
HARRY:
I think that's a yes.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.433
[]Uh, look, uh,
someone is...

19:03.435 --> 19:07.737
is making a... a big play,
uh, for Okada, right?

19:07.739 --> 19:09.806
And they need
a lot of guns to do that,

19:09.808 --> 19:11.675
so what I'm...
what I'm gonna ask you is--

19:11.677 --> 19:12.809
who's made
a big purchase...

19:12.811 --> 19:14.911
recently?

19:19.751 --> 19:22.419
Okay, um, I-I assume
you are familiar

19:22.421 --> 19:24.588
with the term
“good cop, bad cop.”

19:24.590 --> 19:26.590
Yeah, uh,
in this case, I am

19:26.592 --> 19:28.959
definitely, definitely
the good cop.

19:28.961 --> 19:31.528
Right, those guys, on the
other hand, they are,

19:31.530 --> 19:34.531
uh, the bad cops. In fact,
they're not even cops, so...

19:34.533 --> 19:38.201
if I was you, I would speak
to me, as opposed to them.

19:38.203 --> 19:39.970
No?

19:39.972 --> 19:41.872
Okay.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.207
I warned you, buddy.

19:44.209 --> 19:45.609
He's all yours.

19:45.611 --> 19:47.177
All right.

19:47.179 --> 19:50.447
Mr. Manui has decided
to make this fun for us.

19:50.449 --> 19:52.382
HARRY:
Would you like to have

19:52.384 --> 19:54.251
first crack at him, or
should I give it a go?

19:54.253 --> 19:55.986
Harry, please.

19:55.988 --> 19:57.621
You're our guest.

19:57.623 --> 19:59.656
That's very kind.

20:02.628 --> 20:04.661
♪ ♪

20:20.345 --> 20:21.378
Five-O! Drop your weapons!

20:21.380 --> 20:22.979
(gunfire, men groaning)

20:30.222 --> 20:32.222
(men groaning)

20:33.158 --> 20:34.357
Hey!

20:35.827 --> 20:37.861
Don't move.

20:37.863 --> 20:40.430
Hands where we can see 'em.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.543
I believe this
one's all yours.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.679
I'm never gonna catch that guy.

STEVE: Hey, Danny.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.057
Is that the color
of the booths?

21:07.059 --> 21:10.360
DANNY: Nah, that's Blood.
I ordered Garnet.

21:11.897 --> 21:12.929
(lock buzzes)

21:12.931 --> 21:14.998
Oh, <i>après vous.</i>

21:15.000 --> 21:18.268
Oh, this place
brings back memories.

21:22.307 --> 21:25.508
So, I mean, Christmas must have
come early for you guys,

21:25.510 --> 21:26.776
all those shiny
new toys you got.

21:26.778 --> 21:27.844
DANNY:
What are the odds that,

21:27.846 --> 21:29.112
when we run those guns,
we're gonna get

21:29.114 --> 21:31.581
a ballistics match
to the Okada shooting?

21:31.583 --> 21:32.949
Go ahead.

21:32.951 --> 21:35.285
You'll be wasting your time.

21:35.287 --> 21:37.654
What, you-you...
you want us to believe

21:37.656 --> 21:38.755
you weren't behind that hit?

21:38.757 --> 21:40.257
Why you got all
the new hardware,

21:40.259 --> 21:41.658
Viktor?

21:41.660 --> 21:43.727
Because...

21:43.729 --> 21:46.529
we were gearing up to make
a play for Jimmy's turf.

21:46.531 --> 21:50.767
But only after the Feds sent
him to the Halawa Hilton.

21:51.737 --> 21:53.837
See, thanks to someone
I know at the agency,

21:53.839 --> 21:55.171
I know about the RICO case.

21:55.173 --> 21:57.307
Just waiting for the
perfect time to make that move.

21:57.309 --> 21:59.776
I might be crazy,

21:59.778 --> 22:03.380
but I'm not stupid enough
to risk taking Jimmy out

22:03.382 --> 22:06.182
from right under the noses
of the FBI.

22:11.023 --> 22:12.122
(bell dings)

22:13.925 --> 22:14.891
Well,

22:14.893 --> 22:17.193
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

22:17.195 --> 22:19.129
but it appears
that your man Viktor

22:19.131 --> 22:20.563
is telling the truth.

22:20.565 --> 22:22.699
Those guns
that you guys seized

22:22.701 --> 22:24.434
had nothing to do
with the Okada hit.

22:24.436 --> 22:25.835
Okay, how do we know this?

22:25.837 --> 22:28.838
Because the ballistics report
came back from the crime scene.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.874
All the shots
that were fired in the place

22:30.876 --> 22:32.575
came from one gun.
One gun?

22:32.577 --> 22:34.210
One gun--

22:34.212 --> 22:36.680
Browning Buck Mark .22 LR.

22:36.682 --> 22:37.947
Registered right
here in town,

22:37.949 --> 22:40.150
and somebody reported it
stolen three days ago.

22:40.152 --> 22:41.751
DANNY:
One guy

22:41.753 --> 22:43.253
goes into Jimmy Okada's
headquarters

22:43.255 --> 22:44.688
and takes out ten armed men?

22:44.690 --> 22:46.356
I found it hard
to believe myself,

22:46.358 --> 22:48.091
but the evidence
supports it.

22:48.093 --> 22:49.492
Based on the FBI

22:49.494 --> 22:50.927
audio recordings

22:50.929 --> 22:52.662
and the positions of
the mics in the office,

22:52.664 --> 22:53.897
I was able to
reconstruct

22:53.899 --> 22:55.265
the shooter's steps.

22:55.267 --> 22:56.933
First of all,
the recording confirms

22:56.935 --> 22:59.135
that he came in
through the emergency exit.

22:59.137 --> 23:01.304
<i>He first takes out</i>
<i>the security guard at the door,</i>

23:01.306 --> 23:02.872
<i>and then moves inside.</i>

23:02.874 --> 23:04.441
<i>Seven shots,</i>

23:04.443 --> 23:06.876
<i>and he wastes the guys</i>
<i>at the card table to his left.</i>

23:06.878 --> 23:09.312
<i>Three men watching TV</i>
<i>go for their weapons,</i>

23:09.314 --> 23:11.581
<i>but he takes them out,</i>
<i>firing on the move.</i>

23:11.583 --> 23:13.983
<i>Drops a mag and reloads,</i>
<i>using the sofa as cover.</i>

23:13.985 --> 23:16.720
That's the magazine
hitting the floor.

23:16.722 --> 23:19.089
<i>Pops up-- two shots</i>
<i>takes out the lieutenant.</i>

23:19.091 --> 23:20.857
<i>Last but not least,</i>
<i>he faces off</i>

23:20.859 --> 23:22.525
<i>against Okada himself.</i>

23:22.527 --> 23:25.095
(yells in pain)

23:25.097 --> 23:27.630
STEVE: Okay, so what you're
saying is, not only did this guy

23:27.632 --> 23:29.299
take out ten armed men
by himself,

23:29.301 --> 23:31.634
he did it in less
than 40 seconds?

23:31.636 --> 23:33.803
This guy's a professional,
maybe a contract killer.

23:33.805 --> 23:35.038
But people in that game

23:35.040 --> 23:36.473
usually have access
to their own weapons.

23:36.475 --> 23:37.941
Ways of getting hold
of clean guns.

23:37.943 --> 23:40.510
I'm with Harry. I mean, doesn't
make any sense this guy

23:40.512 --> 23:42.278
would use
a stolen gun.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.546
Hey, Tani.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.382
Hi.

23:46.318 --> 23:47.384
And who might you be?

23:47.386 --> 23:49.018
DANNY:
Oh, come on, Harry.

23:49.020 --> 23:49.986
HARRY:
Just being polite, Daniel.

23:49.988 --> 23:51.087
TANI: It's okay.
I get it.

23:51.089 --> 23:52.222
He's British.

23:52.224 --> 23:54.124
I'm Tani.
Harry Langford.

23:54.126 --> 23:55.558
Ooh.
Friend of the court.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.862
Oh, boy.
He's very British.

23:58.864 --> 24:00.663
And you're very new
to this job.

24:00.665 --> 24:02.265
How long have you
been a cop?

24:02.267 --> 24:03.867
Couple of weeks now?
What tipped you off?

24:03.869 --> 24:05.301
Well, the glint
on that badge

24:05.303 --> 24:06.770
is practically
blinding me.

24:06.772 --> 24:08.872
Which tells me you
were either up all night

24:08.874 --> 24:10.607
polishing it, or it's
brand-spanking-new.

24:10.609 --> 24:12.142
Second, you're
dressed to impress

24:12.144 --> 24:14.277
in those wedged
espadrilles.

24:14.279 --> 24:16.112
Very de rigueur,
but not exactly practical

24:16.114 --> 24:17.380
when you're
running down a suspect.

24:17.382 --> 24:18.648
All right, well,
they provide

24:18.650 --> 24:21.484
a shocking amount of
support, so thank you.

24:21.486 --> 24:23.119
And thirdly,
you still have

24:23.121 --> 24:24.687
that sparkle
of enthusiasm to you,

24:24.689 --> 24:27.257
unlike these boys,
who are dead behind the eyes.

24:27.259 --> 24:29.692
It's true.
I'm dead behind the eyes.

24:29.694 --> 24:31.261
Okay, that's enough.

24:31.263 --> 24:33.430
Tani, what do you got?

24:33.432 --> 24:34.431
Got a fresh lead.

24:34.433 --> 24:35.899
Got a hit on that
missing waitress,

24:35.901 --> 24:38.468
slash potential witness,
slash potential accomplice,

24:38.470 --> 24:39.569
Annie Hughes.

24:39.571 --> 24:40.837
Her credit card
was just used

24:40.839 --> 24:43.606
to check into a hotel
on the North Shore.

24:44.743 --> 24:46.242
All right. Lou, Tani,

24:46.244 --> 24:48.311
follow up on that
stolen murder weapon.

24:48.313 --> 24:51.014
We'll go see if we can
track down Annie Hughes.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.119
All right.

24:56.121 --> 25:00.290
I'll just, uh, stay here
and, uh, hold down the fort.

25:00.292 --> 25:02.826
I've been in two fights,
had a near-death experience

25:02.828 --> 25:04.561
and ruined a $4,000 suit--

25:04.563 --> 25:05.662
all before tea time.

25:05.664 --> 25:07.263
I apologize for
all of that,

25:07.265 --> 25:09.265
but you-you did ask
to tag along...

25:09.267 --> 25:11.334
No. No, no.

25:11.336 --> 25:12.669
I'm having a
lovely time.

25:12.671 --> 25:14.671
What do you mean,
you're having a lovely time?

25:14.673 --> 25:16.973
What is the matter with you?
I-I-I can't wait to retire.

25:16.975 --> 25:19.375
Okay? And I don't care
if it's running a restaurant

25:19.377 --> 25:21.177
or spending time
with my kids.

25:21.179 --> 25:23.313
Anything but car chases

25:23.315 --> 25:24.781
and bullets whizzing
past my head.

25:24.783 --> 25:26.516
Anything that doesn't
involve those things

25:26.518 --> 25:28.551
will be a giant improvement
to my quality of life.

25:28.553 --> 25:30.787
Oh, my dear Danny, I used
to think the same thing,

25:30.789 --> 25:31.988
but you don't
appreciate how much

25:31.990 --> 25:33.957
you need the buzz of the job
until it's gone.

25:33.959 --> 25:35.458
Besides, you blokes
don't have it so bad.

25:35.460 --> 25:37.694
Driving around
from witness to witness,

25:37.696 --> 25:39.963
collecting evidence,
getting into some fisticuffs,

25:39.965 --> 25:42.499
little bit of argy bargy
along the way.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.767
It's all quite
quaint, really.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.904
Argy bargy?

25:47.906 --> 25:49.138
You know, an argument.
Mmm.

25:49.140 --> 25:50.740
The constant bickering
you two engage in.

25:50.742 --> 25:52.542
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's clearly coming

25:52.544 --> 25:54.410
from a place of love.
That's why you're going

25:54.412 --> 25:55.979
into the restaurant
trade together.

25:55.981 --> 25:58.548
Can't bear to be apart, right?

26:05.557 --> 26:08.391
(knocking)
STEVE: <i>Annie, Five-O.</i>

26:17.836 --> 26:20.103
Steve.

26:25.844 --> 26:28.011
Body's still warm.

26:30.248 --> 26:32.448
(piano playing simple chords)

26:33.752 --> 26:34.918
That's good.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.086
Try to keep your fingers curved.

26:37.088 --> 26:38.555
(knocking)

26:38.557 --> 26:39.989
Exactly.

26:39.991 --> 26:41.157
I'll be right back.

26:41.159 --> 26:42.458
You just play that through,

26:42.460 --> 26:44.928
and then start over
from the top, okay?

26:44.930 --> 26:47.130
(playing classical melody)

26:51.336 --> 26:53.069
Can I help you?
TANI: Hi, Mr. Walcott.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.671
We're with Five-O.

26:54.673 --> 26:55.972
We were wondering
if we could

26:55.974 --> 26:58.374
talk to you about that gun
you reported stolen.

26:58.376 --> 27:00.777
Well, I-I'm sorry, but it's...
you've caught me

27:00.779 --> 27:02.712
at kind of
a bad time.

27:02.714 --> 27:04.514
I have a student.
I'm a piano teacher.

27:04.516 --> 27:06.082
Well, it'll only take
a few minutes.

27:06.084 --> 27:08.051
We're just following up
on the report.

27:08.053 --> 27:10.386
Yeah. Please, come in.

27:13.992 --> 27:16.326
So, the burglary
happened, uh,

27:16.328 --> 27:18.461
at the beginning
of the week?

27:19.297 --> 27:20.330
Uh, yeah. Tuesday.

27:20.332 --> 27:22.065
Um, but that should
be in the report.

27:22.067 --> 27:24.834
Yeah, we read that.

27:24.836 --> 27:27.070
Little light on detail, though.

27:27.072 --> 27:28.571
So, besides the Browning,

27:28.573 --> 27:30.373
was anything else
in the house taken?

27:30.375 --> 27:33.910
Just a few odds and ends, uh...

27:33.912 --> 27:35.345
a camera, I think.

27:39.384 --> 27:40.883
Just seems a little odd
guy breaks into

27:40.885 --> 27:42.318
your house, takes
a couple odds and ends,

27:42.320 --> 27:45.655
and leaves that valuable
antique set there.

27:45.657 --> 27:48.925
Silver like that gets you
top dollar at a pawnshop.

27:50.095 --> 27:51.894
I wouldn't know.
(chuckling): Yeah.

27:51.896 --> 27:53.096
Of course not.

27:53.098 --> 27:54.897
You're a piano teacher.

27:54.899 --> 27:58.134
(cell phone ringing)

27:58.136 --> 27:59.535
You gonna get that?

27:59.537 --> 28:01.037
Uh, it's...

28:01.039 --> 28:02.071
it's probably a salesman.

28:02.073 --> 28:03.773
I'll just let it go
to voice mail.

28:03.775 --> 28:05.274
Hmm.

28:06.344 --> 28:08.678
(cell phone continues ringing)

28:14.886 --> 28:15.818
Hello?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.020
STEVE:
Lou?

28:17.022 --> 28:18.121
Oh.

28:18.123 --> 28:19.622
I guess you found Annie Hughes.

28:19.624 --> 28:20.990
Or at least her phone.

28:20.992 --> 28:22.792
(sighs) Yeah.
Listen, man, Annie's dead.

28:22.794 --> 28:24.494
She sent a text to this number

28:24.496 --> 28:26.095
right before she was killed.

28:26.097 --> 28:29.365
Came back as a burner.
I figured I'd give it a try.

28:29.367 --> 28:31.134
I'll call you back.

28:31.136 --> 28:33.102
John Walcott,
you're under arrest

28:33.104 --> 28:35.371
for the murder of Jimmy Okada
and nine of his associates.

28:35.373 --> 28:37.040
Get your hands up
over your head.

28:37.042 --> 28:39.742
H-H-Hold on.
What happened to Annie?

28:39.744 --> 28:41.611
We can talk about that
at the station.

28:43.281 --> 28:45.081
She's dead, isn't she?

28:45.083 --> 28:47.483
(tires squealing outside)

28:47.485 --> 28:49.919
Well, this don't
look good.

28:49.921 --> 28:51.821
(tires screech) GROVER: All right,
we need to move now.

28:51.823 --> 28:53.423
I got him.

28:53.425 --> 28:54.991
Tani, get that kid.

28:54.993 --> 28:56.492
Take her
someplace safe.

29:08.604 --> 29:10.084
[]GROVER:
Sit down, get in the corner.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.687
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You just gotta stay down.

29:16.689 --> 29:19.289
Whatever you do, do not move
until I come back for you, okay?

29:19.291 --> 29:20.791
GROVER:
<i>You want to get cute</i>

29:20.793 --> 29:22.492
and try to escape,
there's gonna be lead

29:22.494 --> 29:24.061
flying in here
in a minute.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.029
Be my guest.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.898
And you--
I know you've shot

29:27.900 --> 29:29.499
your weapon before,
but this time

29:29.501 --> 29:30.968
it's gonna be
a little different.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.436
Yeah? How so?

29:32.438 --> 29:34.137
When you shoot somebody
this time,

29:34.139 --> 29:36.073
make sure they don't
get up again.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.316
(men groaning)

30:00.799 --> 30:02.332
(groans)

30:07.539 --> 30:08.905
(groans)

30:16.715 --> 30:18.248
(grunts)

30:20.586 --> 30:22.919
(engine starts, tires squeal)

30:27.292 --> 30:29.226
John?

30:30.729 --> 30:32.095
Okay, come on. Come on.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.430
GROVER:
Hey.

30:34.299 --> 30:35.866
Walcott's gone.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.769
He's gone.

30:38.771 --> 30:40.604
We shouldn't have
left him alone.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.846
Six bad guys.
Five of them are dead.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.183
One escaped when the gunfight
started going our way.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.317
CSU I.D.'d the perps

30:54.319 --> 30:56.520
as known soldiers
of the Okada crime family.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.687
DANNY:
So Derek Okada,

30:57.689 --> 31:00.190
he paid very close
attention to your warning.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.992
Well, you know,
damn millennials.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.494
Okada must have put together
that Annie was in on the hit.

31:04.496 --> 31:05.896
Tortured her until
she gave up Walcott.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.865
DANNY: Hold on
just one second so I'm clear.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.535
This cold-blooded killer,
this psychopath who goes in

31:11.537 --> 31:13.136
and kills Okada
and nine of his men,

31:13.138 --> 31:15.105
you're telling me
he's a piano teacher?

31:15.107 --> 31:17.841
Yeah, I was skeptical,
too, at first.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.645
Till I got a load of this.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.515
DANNY:
Wow.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.054
What a nutjob.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.656
Piano man got it
hooked up down here

31:32.658 --> 31:33.790
like John Wick's man cave, brah.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.692
TANI:
Dozens of books and DVDs

31:35.694 --> 31:38.795
on combat training,
tactical firearm techniques,

31:38.797 --> 31:41.131
body armor, weapons,

31:41.133 --> 31:42.599
maps, surveillance pics.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.403
This was months,
perhaps years of prep.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.207
So, what turns a suburban
piano teacher into Dirty Harry?

31:50.209 --> 31:51.975
JERRY:
Three years ago, Walcott's son,

31:51.977 --> 31:53.710
Aiden, was killed
in a hit-and-run,

31:53.712 --> 31:56.046
and Walcott witnessed
the whole thing.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.948
Well, that would
do it for me.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.083
Seeing your child be killed
right in front of you?

32:00.085 --> 32:01.852
That'd send me over the edge.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.753
STEVE: All right,
and it stays a hit-and-run,

32:03.755 --> 32:05.055
or did the cops
find the driver?

32:05.057 --> 32:06.123
Case is still open,

32:06.125 --> 32:07.724
but I took a look
at the police report,

32:07.726 --> 32:08.859
and something
about Walcott's statement

32:08.861 --> 32:09.893
stood out.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.561
At the time, he
described the vehicle

32:11.563 --> 32:14.097
as an “old, light blue sedan”"

32:14.099 --> 32:15.665
But a broken taillight

32:15.667 --> 32:17.334
recovered at the scene

32:17.336 --> 32:19.469
indicates that it's actually
a late-model Mercedes

32:19.471 --> 32:21.972
that was never manufactured
in that color.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.673
TANI:
I don't get it.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.742
Even if Walcott was in shock
after seeing his kid

32:25.744 --> 32:27.210
get run down,
how could you get

32:27.212 --> 32:28.712
the description
of the car that wrong?

32:28.714 --> 32:29.679
Unless he didn't.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.348
Unless he knew
what car it was.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.616
And who was driving it.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.184
JERRY: Right.
I took a flier

32:34.186 --> 32:35.585
and pulled Okada's
car registration.

32:35.587 --> 32:38.121
And guess what kind of vehicle
he drove three years ago.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.789
A Mercedes.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.126
JERRY:
2015 Mercedes CL, to be precise.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.794
There's your motive.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.930
GROVER:
Son of a bitch.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.065
Okada must have
convinced Walcott

32:49.067 --> 32:50.433
not to report it to the police.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.002
Probably threatened him
and his wife.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.171
DANNY:
<i>Well, that would explain</i>

32:54.173 --> 32:55.639
<i>the inconsistencies</i>
<i>in Walcott's statement.</i>

32:55.641 --> 32:56.973
GROVER:
<i>So he just plays along,</i>

32:56.975 --> 32:58.742
<i>pretending everything's</i>
<i>all good; meanwhile,</i>

32:58.744 --> 33:00.810
<i>on the inside,</i>
<i>his blood is boiling.</i>

33:00.812 --> 33:02.946
STEVE:
<i>Right, he's biding his time,</i>

33:02.948 --> 33:05.782
<i>he's planning his revenge,</i>
<i>and then he executes.</i>

33:05.784 --> 33:06.883
Okay, that explains that,

33:06.885 --> 33:08.885
but how does Annie Hughes
get caught up in this?

33:08.887 --> 33:11.154
- I have an answer for that, too.
- Of course you do.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.990
Annie's brother was killed
in a robbery back in 2014.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.258
And then,
shortly after that,

33:15.260 --> 33:17.027
she joined a bereavement
support group.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.461
Where she met John Walcott.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.197
JERRY: And, based on
the text messages

33:20.199 --> 33:22.032
we pulled off of Annie's cell,

33:22.034 --> 33:24.401
that quickly developed
into a romantic relationship.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.036
DANNY:
Ah.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.771
So he ropes his girlfriend into

33:27.773 --> 33:29.306
his revenge plan?

33:29.308 --> 33:31.174
And now she's dead,
and you better believe

33:31.176 --> 33:32.509
he ain't letting
that go, either.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.543
STEVE:
Oh, no.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.879
This is far from over.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.883
So you saw him escape?
It was definitely him?

33:44.323 --> 33:46.523
(frustrated yell)

33:48.727 --> 33:50.260
You should skip town
for a while.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.696
Just until Walcott's
been put down.

33:54.399 --> 33:57.267
(cell phone ringing)

34:08.380 --> 34:09.446
Hello.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.848
You're next.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.416
(click)

34:24.264 --> 34:25.862
[]I want this place locked down!

34:26.926 --> 34:28.292
There's 20 grand
for the man

34:28.293 --> 34:31.062
who shoots this piece
of garbage dead.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.235
(siren wailing)

34:38.237 --> 34:39.603
This is Captain
Lou Grover, Five-O.

34:39.606 --> 34:42.072
I need all available
HPD and SWAT units.

34:42.074 --> 34:44.408
I need a two-block
perimeter

34:44.409 --> 34:46.777
around Okada's
building right now.

34:49.815 --> 34:51.248
(groans)

34:51.251 --> 34:53.251
(grunting)
(elevator bell dings)

34:55.554 --> 34:58.556
MAN (over radio):
We have an elevator coming up.

35:03.930 --> 35:05.630
It's him.

35:05.632 --> 35:08.232
He's in the elevator.

35:08.234 --> 35:10.234
(guns cock)

35:10.236 --> 35:11.736
(bell dings)

35:17.544 --> 35:21.646
(smooth, jazzy
elevator music playing)

35:26.953 --> 35:29.120
(gun cocks, silenced gunshot)
(yells)

35:30.890 --> 35:32.290
(silenced gunshot)
(groans)

35:32.292 --> 35:35.259
(distant, frantic chatter)

35:36.563 --> 35:37.862
(bell dings)

35:37.864 --> 35:40.731
(frantic chatter grows closer)

36:02.155 --> 36:03.621
(whirring)

36:06.526 --> 36:07.892
(groaning)

36:09.329 --> 36:11.929

36:14.767 --> 36:16.968

<i>Go check.</i>

36:25.578 --> 36:26.644

36:26.646 --> 36:28.746
Go. Go.

36:33.486 --> 36:35.019

36:39.292 --> 36:40.524

36:48.868 --> 36:51.168
(Derek groaning)

36:51.170 --> 36:53.571
(gasps, grunts)

36:53.573 --> 36:56.507
(gasping)

37:08.354 --> 37:09.787
JOHN:
You know who I am?

37:10.657 --> 37:12.390
Why I'm here?

37:14.360 --> 37:16.727
STEVE:
John. John.

37:18.197 --> 37:19.964
Drop the weapon, John.

37:22.769 --> 37:25.036
It's over, John.
Drop the gun.

37:27.473 --> 37:29.640
Not yet.

37:29.642 --> 37:32.310
He has to pay.

37:32.312 --> 37:34.779
And not just for Annie.

37:37.617 --> 37:39.951
Tell them, Derek.

37:41.521 --> 37:43.321
He was in the car.

37:43.323 --> 37:45.122
The car that killed Aiden.

37:45.892 --> 37:48.159
When they saw what
they had done,

37:48.161 --> 37:51.729
Derek here tried
to buy my silence.

37:53.333 --> 37:55.566
But his father
wouldn't have it.

37:56.536 --> 37:58.936
Said he'd already
taken my son,

37:58.938 --> 38:00.471
and if I went to the cops,

38:00.473 --> 38:02.873
he would kill the rest
of my family, too.

38:02.875 --> 38:04.775
STEVE: This isn't going
to change any of that.

38:04.777 --> 38:07.144
You understand?
You put that gun down,

38:07.146 --> 38:10.147
and we can talk about it.
We'll work through this, John.

38:10.149 --> 38:11.949
HARRY:
He's right.

38:11.951 --> 38:13.951
I've been where you are
right now.

38:13.953 --> 38:16.153
Someone I loved very much
was taken away from me.

38:16.155 --> 38:17.922
You think this
will take away the pain,

38:17.924 --> 38:20.491
but it won't,
and it won't bring them back.

38:32.238 --> 38:34.372
I know.

38:35.608 --> 38:37.942
(body thuds)
STEVE: Hands! Hands!

38:37.944 --> 38:39.210
Behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

38:39.212 --> 38:41.712
Three steps forward.
Walk. Walk!

38:42.582 --> 38:43.748
Stop there.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.182
Stop. Turn around.
Turn around.

38:45.184 --> 38:46.517
Get on your knees.

38:46.519 --> 38:48.285
On your knees right now.
Right now.

38:48.287 --> 38:49.320
Cross your ankles.

38:49.322 --> 38:50.988
Cross 'em.

38:53.393 --> 38:55.626
(handcuffs clicking)

38:56.863 --> 38:58.696
Come on up.

39:06.406 --> 39:07.571
You, uh... you still happy

39:07.573 --> 39:09.573
you decided to spend
the day with us?

39:09.575 --> 39:11.742
Well, let's say I have
a newfound appreciation

39:11.744 --> 39:13.244
for what you boys do.

39:13.246 --> 39:15.012
Well, we appreciate
the help today, Harry.

39:15.014 --> 39:16.180
Thanks, man.
Anytime.

39:16.182 --> 39:19.016
I really should be getting
back to the hotel.

39:19.018 --> 39:20.317
After today's
shenanigans,

39:20.319 --> 39:22.653
I may be in a spot of
bother with the lady.

39:22.655 --> 39:23.754
DANNY:
Huh.

39:23.756 --> 39:26.557
Well, I may have told
her that I was just

39:26.559 --> 39:28.292
popping out for some sun cream.

39:28.294 --> 39:29.794
Ah.

39:29.796 --> 39:32.329
Yeah, you got trouble,
buddy, for sure.

39:32.331 --> 39:35.966
I actually, uh...
I think I got a...

39:35.968 --> 39:38.769
think I got a way
we can smooth things over.

40:03.696 --> 40:06.363
You did. Thank you.

40:07.433 --> 40:09.066
I'm sure they won't
be much longer.

40:09.068 --> 40:10.701

40:10.703 --> 40:12.336
DANNY:
Hot!

40:12.338 --> 40:14.071
STEVE: I know it's hot.
I told you it was hot, Danny.

40:14.073 --> 40:16.040
DANNY: You told me it was hot.
STEVE: What's wrong with you?

40:16.042 --> 40:17.508
DANNY: What's wrong with me?
You said it's hot,

40:17.510 --> 40:18.542
not thermonuclear, okay?

40:18.544 --> 40:20.177
I thought that the
plate was gonna melt.

40:20.179 --> 40:22.713
STEVE: The plate is made of porcelain.
Porcelain doesn't melt.

I cannot be, uh, uh...

40:25.384 --> 40:27.585

Get out of the kitchen.

40:33.826 --> 40:36.460
Hey, uh... so here's the thing.

40:36.462 --> 40:37.561
We, uh, just had a...

40:37.563 --> 40:38.996
a small problem
with the appetizers.

40:38.998 --> 40:40.898
Yeah, wait, listen--
we're gonna go, uh...

40:40.900 --> 40:43.134
we're just gonna start
with the entrees tonight.

40:43.136 --> 40:45.269
DANNY:
If that's all right.

40:45.271 --> 40:47.438
Are they ready to go?

40:51.144 --> 40:53.001
Yeah, depends... What-what
exactly do you mean, “ready to go”?

40:53.002 --> 40:54.678
They're ready to
go into the oven.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.747
Right now, they're ready to go.
They're good. Next.

40:56.749 --> 40:59.216
Right in the oven.
We're gonna do it now. Right now.

40:59.218 --> 41:01.018
Sorry, boys.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.419
STEVE: No. Wait,
wait, wait, wait,

41:02.421 --> 41:04.989
wait, wait, wait.
No, it won't...

41:04.991 --> 41:06.257
we're not
gonna be long.

41:06.259 --> 41:08.592
Will you...
It won't be long.

41:08.594 --> 41:10.227
HARRY:
Don't worry, darling.

41:10.229 --> 41:11.829
I know a great local spot

41:11.831 --> 41:14.365
where they don't require
a reservation.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.536
(sighs)

41:20.406 --> 41:22.339
Where's a great local spot

41:22.341 --> 41:24.675
that doesn't require
a reservation?

41:36.622 --> 41:38.622
Sir and madame
are enjoying their entrees?

41:38.624 --> 41:41.425
The food
is simply divine.

41:41.427 --> 41:42.660
Thank you.

41:42.662 --> 41:44.728
As is the company.

41:46.566 --> 41:48.432
You two know
I love you guys, right?

41:51.003 --> 41:52.636
KAMEKONA: Take a good look,
my friends.

41:52.638 --> 41:53.771
That's called...

41:53.773 --> 41:55.606
customer
satisfaction.

41:55.608 --> 41:59.577
May be a while before
you guys see that again.
