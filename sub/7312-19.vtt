WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:07.007
[upbeat pop song
playing on car radio]

00:11.272 --> 00:12.621
MAN:
God, I feel like all
that we've seen

00:12.664 --> 00:14.231
is snow
for the last few months.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.016
Well, it had to melt
sooner or later.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.626
Hey, look.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.497
Aren't those trees
just, like, gorgeous?

00:19.541 --> 00:22.065
Oh, yeah, amazing.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.067
Did you know they don't
get Wi-Fi up here?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.764
Scott, stop being a jerk.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.811
And, come on, the
whole point of this trip

00:28.854 --> 00:30.204
was to get away from this--

00:30.247 --> 00:33.076
technology overload.Right.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.860
Granola therapy...

00:34.904 --> 00:37.428
It's called "green
therapy," idiot.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.996
And you agreed to it weeks ago.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.346
Oh, come on, Scott.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.131
Look, it's a beautiful day.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.829
Just... take in the nature
with me, all right?
Jane!

00:46.872 --> 00:47.699
[tires screech]

00:52.878 --> 00:54.228
Whoa!

00:54.271 --> 00:58.101
You almost splattered nature
all over the windshield.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.363
Come on.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.365
What? Jane!

01:01.409 --> 01:03.106
Let's go, Scott.
I want a picture.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.727
Wow. She's beautiful.

01:15.771 --> 01:18.730
Yeah, well, she's wearing
a coat; I'm not.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.254
Can we please go back to
the car? It's freezing.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.430
Shh.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.953
JANE: [gasps]
Oh, my God.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.869
She's looking at us.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.263
That's because we look
really stupid right now.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.487
Scott...

01:38.272 --> 01:39.882
Oh, my God.

02:12.828 --> 02:14.569
Hm... mm...

02:14.612 --> 02:17.920
Huh.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.313
[sniffing]

02:19.356 --> 02:20.488
McGee, tampering with
someone else's mail

02:20.531 --> 02:22.185
is a federal offense,
is it not?

02:22.229 --> 02:24.013
I believe it is, Ziva.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.450
And we are federal agents.

02:26.494 --> 02:29.932
McGEE: So it'd seem it's our
duty would be to arrest him.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.238
How do you know
it's not mine?

02:31.281 --> 02:33.153
Because it's addressed to Gibbs.

02:33.196 --> 02:33.979
Eagle eye, McGee.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.764
What else do you see?

02:35.807 --> 02:37.940
Tony, why are you trying
to look at Gibbs' mail?

02:37.983 --> 02:39.289
Oh, come on.
Isn't it obvious?

02:39.333 --> 02:41.335
The raised calligraphy,
the paper that's made

02:41.378 --> 02:43.685
from a fabric more expensive
than Timmy's shirt.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.208
Sorry.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.819
He got the same
wedding invitation last week.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.908
How would you
know that?
I saw it.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.911
Same fancy paper,
same fancy handwriting.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.435
Well, someone's being
persistent.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.654
Who would want to invite Gibbs
to their wedding?

02:56.698 --> 02:59.396
Yeah. Guy's got worse wedding
juju than Billy Bob Thornton,

02:59.440 --> 03:01.093
and Larry King combined.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.530
ZIVA:
You are overreacting.

03:02.573 --> 03:03.966
I, for one, would not mind

03:04.009 --> 03:05.185
having Gibbs there
when I get married.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.450
Hypothetically!

03:09.493 --> 03:11.147
I mean, you know,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.844
When I-- someday--
you know, if I...

03:14.150 --> 03:15.238
It is not important.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.631
Clearly.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.460
So what does your
"Ray of sunshine" think?

03:19.503 --> 03:21.113
We have not
discussed it.
I see.

03:21.157 --> 03:25.205
Raymondo... plays his cards
close to the vest?

03:25.248 --> 03:27.816
Raymondo and I have not
discussed the future.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.034
We are taking it...

03:30.253 --> 03:32.255
...slow.
Hm.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.952
Think that's
a very smart idea, Ziva.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.519
Thank you very much, McGee.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.521
Now you're taking love advice
from Agent Hot Britches there?

03:37.565 --> 03:39.828
Man who makes Belgravian
princesses swoon

03:39.871 --> 03:41.699
and hot blonde gamers overload?

03:41.743 --> 03:44.702
How's that going,
by the way?

03:44.746 --> 03:46.530
How about you, Tony?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.358
[playful laugh]

03:48.402 --> 03:51.753
Seems like your libido
has been very satisfied lately.

03:51.796 --> 03:56.279
Are you taking it slow...
with anyone?

03:56.323 --> 03:57.976
Nothing a cold shower

03:58.020 --> 03:59.674
in the agents' locker room
wouldn't cure.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.545
GIBBS: More information
than I want to know.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.503
Grab your gear.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.244
Where to, boss?

04:04.287 --> 04:05.810
Dead Navy lieutenant commander
outside of Shenandoah.

04:18.954 --> 04:19.911
Come on! Let's go.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.747
Beautiful spring day.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.923
Not as nice as June,
of course.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.838
June's perfect
for all kinds of events,

04:33.882 --> 04:35.971
weddings...

04:40.105 --> 04:42.325
DUCKY:
Yes, Henry David Thoreau said

04:42.369 --> 04:45.154
that spring
was "a natural resurrection,

04:45.197 --> 04:47.678
expression of immortality."

04:47.722 --> 04:50.290
Well, Ducky, I think
Lieutenant Commander
Patrick Casey

04:50.333 --> 04:51.639
would beg
to differ with you.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.989
[Jimmy laughs]

04:54.032 --> 04:55.599
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.079
Hon, where did you say
we're going to dinner?

04:57.122 --> 05:00.125
"Oh, hon..."
the commander cares little

05:00.169 --> 05:02.171
about your evening plans,
Mr. Palmer.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.391
Uh, y-yeah, Breena?
Breena, I got to go.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.696
JIMMY: Yeah, have fun
aspirating the bile.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.176
I am so sorry.

05:07.219 --> 05:09.004
Um, she likes to have
someone to talk to

05:09.047 --> 05:10.875
while she's... embalming.

05:10.919 --> 05:14.052
Think you should marry
that girl, Palmer.

05:14.096 --> 05:17.795
McGEE: Boss, found an I.D.
for Commander Casey.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.971
Defense Intelligence Agency.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.017
Secret-keepers, huh?

05:22.060 --> 05:23.366
Yeah. Cash and, uh, credit cards
are accounted for,

05:23.410 --> 05:24.628
so it wasn't a robbery.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.021
Okay, Duck.Time of death,

05:26.064 --> 05:28.240
approximately 11:00 p.m.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.546
Multiple gunshot wounds.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.070
And this one suggests
hollow-point rounds,

05:32.114 --> 05:33.071
though I won't
know for certain

05:33.115 --> 05:34.377
until I get him
back to Autopsy.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.596
Got an exit?

05:35.639 --> 05:38.120
Uh, Agent McGee,
would you help Mr. Palmer

05:38.163 --> 05:39.556
roll the body, please?

05:39.600 --> 05:42.603
Here we go...

05:42.646 --> 05:45.257
I don't see any.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.477
That's odd.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.784
I mean, what goes in,
should come out.

05:49.827 --> 05:50.915
Or not.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.003
ZIVA:
Gibbs, I believe

05:52.047 --> 05:53.178
the commander crawled,

05:53.222 --> 05:55.311
trying to make it
to the road.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.576
ZIVA:
I found a blood trail.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.273
From where?
TONY:
Boss!

06:01.317 --> 06:03.188
Should take a look at this.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.974
TONY:
Commander Casey left a message.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.720
"Birdsong"?

06:14.548 --> 06:16.637
ZIVA: Looks like it's written
in his own blood.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.771
What does
"Birdsong" mean?

06:33.436 --> 06:35.525
MAN [over speaker]: I wish I
could help you, Agent Gibbs,

06:35.569 --> 06:38.354
but it could take weeks for
the Defense Intelligence Agency

06:38.398 --> 06:41.531
to pour over Lieutenant
Commander Casey's assignments

06:41.575 --> 06:43.098
to determine what can
and cannot be released.

06:43.141 --> 06:46.449
Are you familiar with something
called "Birdsong," Admiral?

06:46.493 --> 06:48.103
[clears throat]

06:48.146 --> 06:49.713
The commander,
he that wrote that

06:49.757 --> 06:51.846
in his own blood before he died.

06:53.021 --> 06:55.197
Nothing comes to mind.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.199
Well, come on.
It's got to mean something.

06:57.242 --> 07:00.637
Look, Casey was a good man
and a hell of an officer,

07:00.681 --> 07:02.596
but we had limited interaction,

07:02.639 --> 07:06.208
and I couldn't possibly know
every detail of his involvement.

07:06.251 --> 07:10.038
DIA pulls people from
different parts of the service.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.735
Determined by expertise,
on a case-by-case basis.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.215
This man's dead.

07:13.258 --> 07:16.261
You think his "expertise"
was related?

07:16.305 --> 07:17.698
I wish I knew.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.483
You said you wanted to help.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.832
Of course.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.138
I'm ready when you are.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.098
What are you suggesting,
Agent Gibbs?

07:27.142 --> 07:28.578
I don't know, sir.

07:28.622 --> 07:31.146
You're the one with all those
"I was there" ribbons.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.321
[Admiral clears this throat]

07:32.364 --> 07:33.801
You'll be in touch?

07:37.544 --> 07:39.633
TONY: Boss, Metro PD
found Casey's car

07:39.676 --> 07:41.809
abandoned
outside a restaurant.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.593
Unlocked, keys on the ground,
cell phone smashed.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.421
Looks like he was jumped.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
Have McGee dig into Casey.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.208
And find me "Birdsong."

07:51.993 --> 07:55.344
Cellular communication,
text messaging, squeaking...

07:55.387 --> 07:57.520
It's "tweeting," Doctor.
Huh?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.435
Like the little yellow
canary and the puddy tat.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.697
I used to love that
cartoon when I was a kid.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.525
These distractions

08:02.569 --> 08:06.355
feed the ever-growing beast
known as instant gratification.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.444
I promise it will
never happen again.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.532
I'm going to call Breena
immediately and let her know

08:09.576 --> 08:10.446
that our chats
have been getting--

08:10.490 --> 08:11.447
No!
No?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.492
Well, yes, no--

08:12.535 --> 08:13.971
you're completely
missing the point.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.931
If you keep in
constant contact
with your lover,

08:16.974 --> 08:19.281
she will get to know you
too well.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.804
Hmm...

08:20.848 --> 08:22.240
I don't follow.

08:22.284 --> 08:25.374
You lose...
the thrill of discovery,

08:25.417 --> 08:27.985
the mystery of not knowing.

08:28.029 --> 08:31.119
Secrets, if handled properly,

08:31.162 --> 08:33.077
can be extremely alluring.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.952
Ah, Jethro, I was just
telling Mr. Palmer

08:37.995 --> 08:40.650
the benefits of self-restraint.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.565
Just tell me
what you got, Duck.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.480
Well, I've determined
the type of rounds

08:44.524 --> 08:46.526
used to kill
the lieutenant commander.

08:46.569 --> 08:50.399
He was shot six times
with frangible ammunition.

08:50.442 --> 08:54.098
Each bullet was made
of sintered copper,

08:54.142 --> 08:56.100
designed to disintegrate

08:56.144 --> 08:57.406
into powder and
fragments upon impact.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.976
The dispersal of these

09:02.019 --> 09:04.892
accounts for the extensive
damage beneath the dermis.

09:04.935 --> 09:08.330
And as there was no
residue on his clothing

09:08.373 --> 09:11.159
to indicate that the
shooter was close...

09:11.202 --> 09:13.465
We're looking
for a weapon...

09:13.509 --> 09:15.598
that fires frangible ammo
at a distance.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.165
It's rare, Duck.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.863
Yeah, anything more specific
will have to come from Abby.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.735
I already brought
some fragments up to her.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.258
DUCKY:
Whatever her findings,

09:23.301 --> 09:25.521
it's an odd
choice of weapon.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.176
I mean, either the
killer was unfamiliar

09:28.219 --> 09:30.178
with the weaponry or,

09:30.221 --> 09:32.397
well, maybe he wanted

09:32.441 --> 09:35.139
this poor fellow
to suffer great pain.

09:35.183 --> 09:38.186
Or both.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.491
ZIVA: Lieutenant Commander
Patrick Casey.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.842
Born in Pensacola,
Florida.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.452
His parents
were career Navy.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.280
Both are now deceased; Patrick
followed in their footsteps.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.151
DIA kept him...

09:47.195 --> 09:48.457
traveling,
but unfortunately,

09:48.500 --> 09:51.286
his destinations
remain classified.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.809
You lose something,
DiNozzo?

09:52.853 --> 09:54.158
No, boss.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.900
Did you find something?

09:56.944 --> 09:58.467
[laughing]:
No...

10:00.295 --> 10:03.559
Oh, about the...
uh, yeah, kind of.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.474
The waiter at the restaurant
where Casey's car was found

10:05.517 --> 10:07.258
said that he dined with a woman.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.390
Uh, wasn't a date, though.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.131
They shook hands
at the end of the meal.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.655
Then she left. Casey stayed
until just before closing.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.004
The waiter's working
with the sketch artist now.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.440
Tim, talk to me.

10:15.484 --> 10:18.487
Boss, I am knee-deep
in the DIA servers here.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.010
Listen to this:
Three days ago,

10:20.054 --> 10:22.404
the department's general
counsel got their hands

10:22.447 --> 10:23.753
on a manuscript
they had heard of.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.060
Potential leak of classified
military information.

10:26.103 --> 10:29.672
Yeah, and?The title of the manuscript
was "Operation Birdsong."

10:29.716 --> 10:31.021
Somebody looking
to publish it?

10:31.065 --> 10:32.762
Capitol Crossroads Press.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.983
It's a boutique publishing house
run by Madeleine DuMont.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.506
Book like this
could really

10:37.549 --> 10:39.247
take her little imprint
to the next level.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.204
What's the connection
to the case?

10:40.248 --> 10:41.684
Nothing yet.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.643
But there's only one
way to find out.

10:43.686 --> 10:47.516
Find the publisher,
McGee-- Ms. DuMont.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.822
Well, why me?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.824
You're the writer, right?

10:58.092 --> 10:59.876
[Tony clicks his tongue]

11:12.889 --> 11:14.238
Tony.
Ziva.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.414
You're in the women's shower,
fully clothed,

11:16.458 --> 11:20.070
and... you are holding
Gibbs's mail.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.682
What's your point?

11:22.725 --> 11:24.553
That letter is not for
you to read.
I know.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.598
But there's so many questions
to be answered.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.078
The happiest day
in someone's life,

11:28.122 --> 11:30.254
and they need Leroy Jethro Gibbs
there to seal the deal?

11:30.298 --> 11:31.691
Doesn't make any sense.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.780
All right, so be honest.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.825
Surely, you would want
Gibbs there at your wedding.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.872
Well, I don't know if a head
slap coming down the aisle

11:38.915 --> 11:41.135
is the ideal Kodak moment.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.179
Maybe you're right.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.877
Okay, so, I have a question.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.835
Have you seen Agent Barrett?

11:49.230 --> 11:50.927
No.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.842
Why do you keep
asking about her?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.017
I have only asked you once.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.411
Hm. Why here?

11:56.454 --> 11:57.760
[laughs] You mean,
in the shower?

11:57.804 --> 12:00.067
Because I have
seen her here, I guess.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.285
She intrigues me.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.809
Does she intrigue you?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.376
Well...

12:05.420 --> 12:07.378
I can't really...

12:07.422 --> 12:09.554
Hmm. She must be
assembling her team.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.122
I wonder when
she's due back.
Me, too.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.558
Pardon me?

12:13.602 --> 12:15.691
I should stop this.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.128
You should stop...
what, exactly?

12:18.172 --> 12:20.522
This. Everyone deserves
their privacy.

12:20.565 --> 12:24.134
Even Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
[chuckles]

12:24.178 --> 12:25.788
See you.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.971
Have we met?

12:35.015 --> 12:37.757
Um, no, no, never.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.585
Absolutely not.
I rarely
forget a face.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.109
And there are some
very interesting ones

12:42.152 --> 12:43.240
in the book world.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.808
Yours is... memorable.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.289
I am not in the
book world, Ms. DuMont.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.293
You run out of words, McGee?

12:53.598 --> 12:56.036
Come on.
You're a writer.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.037
Find some.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.821
Who is this?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.170
Another agent?

13:00.214 --> 13:01.911
Another "special agent."

13:03.478 --> 13:05.567
Gibbs.
Delightful.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.047
More Feds.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.832
Who knew I'd be a threat
to national security.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.529
We're not the first
federal agents you've seen?

13:11.573 --> 13:13.575
I've had
half a dozen DIA agents

13:13.618 --> 13:16.143
in and out of my office
for days.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.361
What'd the DIA want?

13:17.405 --> 13:19.146
What the government
does best:

13:19.189 --> 13:22.323
meddle in the affairs
of small businesses.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.629
They confiscated a manuscript
we're about to publish.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.371
All hard copies
and digital files.

13:27.415 --> 13:30.897
The title of this book wouldn't
happen to be Operation Birdsong?

13:30.940 --> 13:32.376
The very same.

13:32.420 --> 13:35.249
They even sent an admiral,

13:35.292 --> 13:37.251
if you can believe that.

13:37.294 --> 13:40.776
Hindley. Awful man.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.039
Said it was for reasons
he couldn't disclose.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.562
What's it about?

13:44.606 --> 13:48.131
Weapons sales.
Corruption.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.959
Intrigue.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.788
A lot of unfortunate
people involved.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.268
You should read it.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.836
Who's the author?

13:58.489 --> 14:01.884
An anonymous former
intelligence operative.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.191
That's all I told Hindley,

14:04.234 --> 14:06.410
and that's all
I'm telling you.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.978
The freedom to write anonymously
is protected

14:09.022 --> 14:10.675
by the First Amendment.Yeah.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.895
I know about
the First Amendment, McGee.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.724
If you want me to disclose
the author's name,

14:15.767 --> 14:17.378
you're going to have
to prove to a judge

14:17.421 --> 14:19.989
that the book really does pose
a threat to national security.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.818
Hindley wasn't exactly eager
to share its contents,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.602
even with a judge.
And...

14:24.646 --> 14:26.648
since you don't
have a copy...

14:27.605 --> 14:28.911
No. No words.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.784
Just a picture.

14:32.828 --> 14:36.484
McGEE: Ms. DuMont,
this book may be related

14:36.527 --> 14:38.225
to a murder
we're investigating.

14:38.268 --> 14:41.228
His name is Lieutenant Commander
Patrick Casey.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.360
You know him?

14:43.404 --> 14:46.450
Yes.

14:46.494 --> 14:49.062
He was one of two people
sent an advance copy;

14:49.105 --> 14:50.672
author's request.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.413
Who's the other one?

14:53.849 --> 14:54.806
[car doors shut]

14:54.850 --> 14:56.373
Read a book,
die mysteriously.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.114
I'm not buying it.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.942
Only happens with cursed
videotapes, you know,

14:59.986 --> 15:02.945
like in that movie The Ring
or the original-- Ringu.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.729
Okay.
Thank you, McGee.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.384
So McGee just called Elise
Archer's office at the FBI.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.777
She did not
go to work today,

15:08.820 --> 15:10.039
and she's not picking up
her phone.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.649
Playing hooky, huh?

15:11.693 --> 15:13.216
I would
never do that.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.219
Agent Archer! NCIS!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.705
Elise Archer?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.977
Tony...

15:55.215 --> 15:59.001
Elise Archer was an expert in
anti-domestic terrorism stings.

15:59.045 --> 16:03.005
Set up phony weapons buys
for homegrown extremists;

16:03.049 --> 16:06.052
made the arrest before anyone
was put in any real danger.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.010
She was a good agent.

16:08.054 --> 16:08.663
Great baker.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.709
You should have had
her baklava.

16:13.102 --> 16:16.018
Duck... talk to me.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.369
This nylon rope
used to strangle Agent Archer

16:19.413 --> 16:20.805
was the same that was used

16:20.849 --> 16:24.113
to bind Lieutenant Commander
Casey's hands.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.550
Murders are related.DUCKY: Probably.

16:26.594 --> 16:31.381
And Agent Archer was killed
after the lieutenant commander.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.080
Cause of death was almost
certainly asphyxiation,

16:34.123 --> 16:36.038
based on this particular
hemorrhaging,

16:36.082 --> 16:38.345
and the ligature marks
on her neck.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.173
But...
FORNELL:
But...

16:40.216 --> 16:41.652
I hate that "but."

16:41.696 --> 16:43.959
There are no
defensive wounds.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.744
Now, with a strangulation,
one would expect her

16:46.788 --> 16:49.921
to wrestle with her attacker;
fight to save her life.

16:49.965 --> 16:54.230
And yet... here... nothing.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.493
It's almost
as if she just gave up.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.234
FORNELL:
That doesn't sound like Archer.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.844
She was a fighter.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.803
She worked hard
to get where she was.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.065
DIA?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.414
She was loaned out...

17:04.458 --> 17:05.546
a few months last year.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.504
Covert ops.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.811
Above my pay-grade.Boss,

17:09.854 --> 17:11.291
Archer does match the sketch

17:11.334 --> 17:13.641
of the woman who had dinner
with Casey last night.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.382
And I also
found this.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.994
The husband works
as a paramedic

17:19.038 --> 17:20.822
for a DC-based
ambulance company.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.650
Been on a 14-hour shift
since last night.

17:22.693 --> 17:23.520
Ziva's tracking him down.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.435
I never met him.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.220
She always said
nice things.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.786
Hey.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.747
You get an invitation
to Diane's wedding?

17:45.673 --> 17:47.631
Yeah.

17:47.675 --> 17:51.505
I got three.
Three?

17:51.548 --> 17:54.551
Woman always was persistent.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.249
Tobias, she was a pain
in the butt.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.947
You going?
Are you?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.297
Hey, boss, someone set
a fire in here recently.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.908
Could be the remnants
of our book.

18:03.952 --> 18:04.909
Bag it, McGee.

18:04.953 --> 18:05.954
Get it to Abby.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.004
You really think this is
the reason for both murders?

18:13.048 --> 18:16.486
I don't know; we have
to read it first.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.661
You know, Jethro...

18:19.707 --> 18:20.969
...if it weren't for Diane...

18:23.276 --> 18:26.061
...we wouldn't have
the kind of relationship that...

18:27.541 --> 18:28.933
...we have.

18:30.457 --> 18:34.461
Tobias, you've always been
a glass-half-full kind of guy.

18:36.811 --> 18:39.770
Never have to pay alimony again.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.208
MAN:
I can't believe Elise is gone.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.731
She, uh...

18:43.774 --> 18:47.561
she was always
worried about me... you know.

18:47.604 --> 18:50.085
Said I was the one
with the dangerous job.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.696
Rocketing through the DC streets
in the middle of the night,

18:52.740 --> 18:54.959
the junkies wielding syringes.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.875
She was just a paper-pusher
at the Bureau.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.139
Or at least that's what
she told me.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.358
She... she couldn't talk
about her work much.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.360
And I didn't ask
too many questions.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.974
Who did this to her?

19:10.018 --> 19:11.846
FORNELL:
Mr. Archer,

19:11.889 --> 19:14.979
there's been another murder
besides your wife,

19:15.023 --> 19:16.677
and we think that
the two might be connected

19:16.720 --> 19:18.200
by a book they were reading.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.810
A book?

19:19.854 --> 19:21.290
GIBBS:
Operation Birdsong.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.902
That was on Elise's nightstand.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.774
She'd been reading it
the past couple days.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.211
Said it was about a
weapons deal or something.

19:30.865 --> 19:34.085
How does a stupid book
get my wife killed?

19:40.962 --> 19:42.572
Hold this, will you?

19:42.616 --> 19:44.748
Thought you were
going to buy me a nice lunch.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.191
[sighs]
What?

19:52.234 --> 19:54.280
Nothing.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.847
I'm just thinking about
the day I married Diane.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.937
Why?

19:59.981 --> 20:02.592
Stirred up memories.[laughing]:
Yeah... well...

20:02.636 --> 20:04.812
Bad ones.Not really.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.944
Our heads were
in the clouds.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.772
We were giddy kids.
We were in love.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.210
Oh, you probably
had the flu.
Oh, come on,
Jethro.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.950
Before it got bad, there must
have been some good times.

20:15.170 --> 20:18.086
She caught her finger
in a car door once.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.133
Hey, Abbs!

20:22.177 --> 20:23.396
Got your book.

20:23.439 --> 20:26.268
Oh. Great.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.965
You know it's supposed to be

20:28.009 --> 20:29.358
burned after reading,
not before.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.404
I'm having flashbacks of
high-school English class.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.971
Fahrenheit 451.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.321
Which had the
unintended consequences

20:35.364 --> 20:37.627
of igniting my interest
in arson science.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.933
No pun intended.
Abby.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.718
Um, okay.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.938
I ran the frangible ammo

20:43.981 --> 20:46.245
that Ducky pulled from
Lieutenant Commander Casey

20:46.288 --> 20:48.769
through every weapons
database that I could access.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.771
And...?
And...

20:50.814 --> 20:53.164
Nothing.
But that's not possible.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.427
And I know that
that's not possible.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.429
So I said to myself, "Self,

20:56.472 --> 20:59.083
why would the weapon used
not be in any weapons database?"

20:59.127 --> 21:00.259
And you know what self said?

21:00.302 --> 21:01.608
Because it's a prototype.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.610
Precisely. I give you...

21:04.785 --> 21:07.004
...the Flint SCR.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.832
Manufactured by
Praeger Industries,

21:08.876 --> 21:10.312
and developed for the DOD.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.836
They ended up
pulling funding

21:12.880 --> 21:15.186
after significant flaws
were found in the design.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.319
Under-penetration of the ammo
was the most noteworthy.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.495
What happened to the gun
after the money was pulled?

21:19.539 --> 21:20.801
I wish I could tell you.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.368
But the rest
of Praeger's records--

21:22.411 --> 21:23.934
they're classified
by the DIA.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.196
A lot of that
going around, lately

21:25.240 --> 21:26.197
That's good work.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.677
Hit the books.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.592
You mean the ashes.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.856
McGee.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.510
Do hope you have something.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.772
Big-time, boss.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.731
Madeleine DuMont just called.

21:37.774 --> 21:38.906
She finally recognize you?

21:38.949 --> 21:39.863
She heard Elise
Archer's dead.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.604
She's afraid she's next.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.651
Publisher. Got a reason
to be concerned.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.348
Well, offer her the safe house.
Get her over here.

21:46.392 --> 21:47.915
Boss, it's too late.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.656
She took a plane
to Argentina.

21:49.699 --> 21:50.657
She panicked.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.398
She's got friends there.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.790
Thought it was
a good idea.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.314
Can't protect her
in Buenos Aires.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.706
It's her decision.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.012
Who else has
read this book?

21:58.055 --> 21:59.448
Got it.

21:59.492 --> 22:02.233
You know anybody in Argentina?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.887
I want that author.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.198
[on phone]:
Hello?

22:10.241 --> 22:12.635
Ms. DuMont, I need that
author's name-- now.

22:15.856 --> 22:20.295
Marine First Lieutenant
Sam Keeler, recently discharged.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.733
Did you write a book-- Operation Birdsong?

22:25.431 --> 22:26.432
Maybe.

22:26.475 --> 22:27.607
Certainly picked
the right publisher.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.826
She sang like a canary.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.741
She promised me anonymity.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.569
Yeah, well, she probably
saved your life.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.484
Who were you hiding from?

22:39.619 --> 22:40.750
Hey, you know what, Keeler?

22:40.794 --> 22:42.099
You can leave. I don't care.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.672
Ms. DuMont called me after DIA
confiscated the manuscript.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.066
Now, look, I don't follow.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.241
How does NCIS fit in?

22:53.284 --> 22:54.590
FBI, as well.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.287
It's an alphabet party.

22:56.331 --> 22:58.420
Where were you last night?

22:58.464 --> 22:59.595
Where I've been
the past week--

22:59.639 --> 23:01.554
keeping my head down.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.207
Staying with friends.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.905
Right where your agents
tracked my cell phone.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.647
Look, what's going on?

23:07.690 --> 23:09.431
Is this about my book?

23:09.475 --> 23:12.216
Yeah.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.435
Have you read it?

23:16.656 --> 23:17.961
No.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.050
But they have.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.192
Operation Birdsong.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.411
What was it?

23:37.067 --> 23:38.460
[sighs]

23:38.504 --> 23:42.029
The three of us

23:42.072 --> 23:44.553
were part of a joint
anti-terrorism task force.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.946
Patrick and Elise
worked point.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.164
I was undercover.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.906
We were assigned to Cyprus.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.691
The farmers there,

23:51.734 --> 23:53.867
they'd blast recordings
of bird songs at night

23:53.910 --> 23:55.869
to lure them
into large nets.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.914
That's what we
were doing.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.176
Only we weren't
going after birds.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.832
We were trying to catch
terrorist groups.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.486
That why Archer
was brought into it?

24:06.183 --> 24:09.360
We'd take the groups down
by staging the sale

24:09.404 --> 24:10.884
of black market weapons.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.886
Used a prototype
the DOD rejected.

24:12.929 --> 24:13.974
The Flint.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.067
Casey, Archer.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.982
You think my book
got them killed?

24:22.025 --> 24:23.505
I don't think. I know.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.202
Look, I was just trying
to do the right thing.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.987
And they thought I was, too.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.597
Are you
a whistle-blower, Keeler?

24:28.641 --> 24:30.512
Read it yourself.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.514
I still have an original
on a hard drive.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.603
Where?
Hidden.

24:34.647 --> 24:35.865
In a storage locker.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.520
Safe.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.435
Well, you thought
you were safe, right?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.089
We found you.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.526
TONY:
Yeah, boss?

24:44.570 --> 24:46.180
Hey.
We found the book.

24:46.223 --> 24:49.705
McGEE:
Diane-- what number
wife was she?

24:49.749 --> 24:51.141
I think Diane
was number two.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.752
She's three.
Or is she four?

24:52.795 --> 24:54.014
She was the redhead.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.581
They're all redheads.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.148
This is why
I'm getting married only once.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.802
I think McHefner here
goes at least two rounds.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.064
Maybe three.
Uh...

25:01.108 --> 25:02.544
I am sure McGee will
find the right woman,

25:02.588 --> 25:03.850
unlike some people.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.200
Nothing wrong with
playing the field, David.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.419
[laughs] That depends on which
field you're playing, Tony.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.770
McGEE: Keeler said
he was locker 37.

25:10.813 --> 25:11.771
That's got to
be around here.

25:11.814 --> 25:12.728
Yeah. Isn't that
the admiral?

25:12.772 --> 25:14.382
ZIVA:
Must be DIA.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.036
Hey, excuse me, guys.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.519
[alarm bell ringing]

25:20.562 --> 25:22.782
[groaning]

25:39.407 --> 25:41.017
[door closes]

25:44.543 --> 25:47.023
You booby-trap
your own locker?

25:49.722 --> 25:51.593
No.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.164
Archer and Casey are dead.

25:57.207 --> 26:00.602
Three DIA agents
are in the hospital.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.518
What's in the book?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.694
This is my fault-- I told
DuMont to send the manuscript

26:05.738 --> 26:06.652
to Patrick and Elise.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.436
I just wanted their approval.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.830
You were discharged early,
after Birdsong.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.005
Why?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.662
I always wanted
to be a Marine.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.098
And not just a good one.

26:18.141 --> 26:19.142
The best.

26:19.186 --> 26:21.362
I followed orders,
toed the line.

26:21.405 --> 26:22.493
No questions asked.

26:22.537 --> 26:23.277
Okay, what changed that?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.278
Birdsong.

26:24.321 --> 26:25.932
How?

26:25.975 --> 26:27.760
Our orders were to target
specific arms dealers

26:27.803 --> 26:29.892
in the region.
Local jihadists.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.286
Turns out the entire op

26:32.329 --> 26:34.288
was a massive waste of
money and resources.

26:34.331 --> 26:35.376
How?

26:35.419 --> 26:37.465
They messed up!

26:37.508 --> 26:38.814
Sit down.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.515
Who messed up?

26:44.559 --> 26:46.735
Somebody near the top.

26:46.779 --> 26:50.957
Over 500 Flint rifles
went missing-- gone.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.177
I was the field op,
so the axe fell on me.

26:54.221 --> 26:57.572
A few weeks later, Casey sent
me some intelligence reports

26:57.616 --> 26:59.356
from units stationed
in Afghanistan.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.445
Insurgents were
using our weapons

27:01.489 --> 27:03.056
to wipe out entire villages.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.798
Innocent people--
women and children.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.626
You know what the brass said?

27:07.669 --> 27:09.149
"Accidents happen."

27:11.238 --> 27:14.633
I may not be able to serve my
country as a Marine anymore.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.461
But that doesn't mean
I can't serve it.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.550
Writing that book?

27:19.594 --> 27:21.683
That was my duty.

27:29.691 --> 27:30.866
Anything?
No.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.042
ABBY:
Yes. Yes. No, no.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.348
Go back, McGee.

27:34.391 --> 27:36.263
Tony, you're hogging
all the end pieces.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.787
That's because I start
with the end pieces.

27:38.831 --> 27:39.832
Haven't you ever done
a puzzle before?

27:39.875 --> 27:41.790
You go out to in.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.357
Have youever done
a puzzle before?

27:43.400 --> 27:44.750
Because you work
in to out.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.577
Will you guys stop?
We're trying to read here.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.277
Why would she invite
two ex-husbands?

27:50.320 --> 27:52.148
[laughing]:
Oh, here he goes.

27:52.192 --> 27:55.804
Tony, you have already learned
who sent out the invitation.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.327
Can you not just
leave it at that?

27:57.371 --> 27:59.286
I mean, how would you like it
if I knew all your secrets?

27:59.329 --> 28:00.940
I don't have any secrets.
I'm an open book.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.202
Just give me the CliffsNotes.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.030
Once at summer camp,
there were these twins

28:04.073 --> 28:05.379
named Marcy and Lois.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.641
[sultry laugh]

28:06.685 --> 28:08.817
It's a long story.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.471
Abby.

28:10.514 --> 28:13.169
Um, okay, fortunately,
Keeler's hard drive

28:13.213 --> 28:14.736
was insulated in a
loaded footlocker.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.564
Unfortunately,
it's still a little fried.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.740
Um, here's what I've man--

28:18.784 --> 28:22.265
what we-- have managed
to put together.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.746
So far, it supports everything
Keeler has told you--

28:24.790 --> 28:26.661
the task force,
Cyprus, arms dealers--

28:26.705 --> 28:27.706
all of it.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.446
Nothing new?

28:29.490 --> 28:30.796
Well, these are
the arms dealers

28:30.839 --> 28:33.320
targeted by
the task force.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.496
Small fish in a big pond,
just like Keeler said.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.585
ABBY: On the surface,
it seems harmless.

28:37.628 --> 28:38.891
Or as harmless

28:38.934 --> 28:40.544
as an arms dealer can be.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.851
But as a whole,
there's a pattern here,

28:42.895 --> 28:44.548
and it's a pattern
that Keeler didn't even see.

28:44.592 --> 28:47.160
As each one of these dealers
were eliminated,

28:47.203 --> 28:49.292
their business had
to move elsewhere.

28:49.336 --> 28:52.600
So we've been tracking terrorist
chat in and out of Cyprus.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.428
Okay. And get this.

28:54.471 --> 28:57.736
In the last year, almost all
of the weapons trafficking

28:57.779 --> 28:59.781
has been swallowed up
by one arms dealer.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.784
A dealer named Jinn.

29:02.828 --> 29:06.135
No one's ever seen Jinn.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.703
That's a supernatural being
from Arab folklore.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.139
Like a... a genie.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.751
So you're saying
that this Jinn profited

29:12.794 --> 29:14.013
from Operation Birdsong?

29:14.056 --> 29:15.231
Big time.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.276
Abbs, you find anything
in the book

29:16.319 --> 29:17.494
about who's
running this show?

29:17.538 --> 29:18.191
I got something
here, boss.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.718
"As pressure mounted, he would
nervously clear his throat,

29:23.762 --> 29:25.459
choking on
his own guilt."

29:37.993 --> 29:39.429
Fully recovered, Admiral?

29:39.473 --> 29:40.735
Special Agent Gibbs.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.781
Bringing me flowers?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.739
Are you Jinn?

29:44.783 --> 29:48.351
[clears throat]

29:48.395 --> 29:50.614
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:50.658 --> 29:51.615
Who's he?

29:51.659 --> 29:52.921
Fornell. FBI.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.836
The more the merrier.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.403
FORNELL:
Sir, I took the liberty

29:56.446 --> 29:58.187
of perusing
your bank accounts.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.189
It's not bad on a
government salary.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.801
What are you insinuating?

30:02.844 --> 30:04.367
I also pulled
your cell phone records.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.891
You received
a text message

30:05.934 --> 30:07.414
from a burn phone
last night,

30:07.457 --> 30:09.590
guiding you to Keeler's
storage locker.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.722
Somebody sent you into a trap.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.724
Your buddy Jinn
tying up loose ends?

30:13.768 --> 30:16.075
Jinn paid you
for those guns.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.293
All you had to do
was cash his check.

30:17.337 --> 30:18.773
Blackmail?

30:18.817 --> 30:21.471
Or you just
that greedy?

30:23.256 --> 30:24.866
Now, you don't have
to say anything.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.172
I know I wouldn't.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.174
I'll bet you didn't
count on Jinn

30:28.217 --> 30:29.653
trying to cover
tracks, though.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.133
Burn the book.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.527
Take out
everyone involved.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.442
Even you.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.444
Where's Jinn? Local?

30:40.795 --> 30:41.840
It's all done via computer.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.584
But I can tell you where she is.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.935
She?!

31:01.816 --> 31:03.644
This is who the admiral
was afraid of?

31:03.687 --> 31:04.863
A college coed?

31:04.906 --> 31:07.169
Mark Zuckerberg created
a social network.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.692
Why can't
Alexis Ross organize

31:08.736 --> 31:12.261
a $100 million arms trade
from her college dorm room?

31:12.305 --> 31:13.959
Hmm.
Well, according to Keeler,

31:14.002 --> 31:15.308
he never knew
who brokered the sale.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.266
Hmm.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.094
She's sort of a combo platter

31:19.138 --> 31:20.922
of Reese Witherspoon
from Legally Blonde

31:20.966 --> 31:22.141
and Russell Crowe
from The Insider.

31:22.184 --> 31:23.707
She's dangerous.

31:23.751 --> 31:24.926
And kind of cute.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.101
Oh, come on, Tony.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.450
She sells weapons.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.061
From her dorm room.

31:29.104 --> 31:31.541
With a minor
in phys ed, maybe.

31:39.593 --> 31:41.638
[wry laugh]

31:41.682 --> 31:43.379
So...

31:43.423 --> 31:46.208
how long will this take?

31:46.252 --> 31:48.341
I have an econ paper
due tomorrow,

31:48.384 --> 31:50.430
and the prof
doesn't give extensions.

31:50.473 --> 31:54.042
One hour ago, my people
picked up a small-time hood

31:54.086 --> 31:56.218
named Charles LeBaron.
40 minutes later,

31:56.262 --> 31:58.133
he confessed
to planting explosives

31:58.177 --> 32:00.135
in a self-storage facility

32:00.179 --> 32:01.441
after you paid him to do it.

32:01.484 --> 32:04.835
On your computer,
we found names, locations,

32:04.879 --> 32:07.316
and routing numbers
for known terrorists.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.325
How did a sweet
little thing like you

32:16.369 --> 32:18.980
get wrapped up
in all this?

32:19.024 --> 32:20.373
GIBBS:
Evidence points to you.

32:20.416 --> 32:23.419
You bullet-proof, Jinn?

32:23.463 --> 32:25.726
[scoffs]

32:25.769 --> 32:27.206
[sighs]

32:27.249 --> 32:29.599
Did she just sigh at Gibbs?

32:29.643 --> 32:30.949
[laughs]

32:30.992 --> 32:32.646
Yes, she did.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.822
You might want to play back
my confusion later,

32:34.865 --> 32:36.171
Special Agent Gibbs.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.999
Your accusations
sound a little crazy.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.136
You want crazy?!
Crazy is a college kid

32:44.179 --> 32:45.485
sitting in her dorm room

32:45.528 --> 32:47.878
with posters on the wall
and her music blaring,

32:47.922 --> 32:50.490
making money off of weapons
that kill innocent people.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.753
Question:

32:52.796 --> 32:55.321
If that were true,
how is that different

32:55.364 --> 32:57.758
from government types
who put weapons in the hands

32:57.801 --> 33:00.717
of private contractors,
the mujahideen and the Somalis?

33:05.331 --> 33:07.463
You think
I'm some messed-up teenager

33:07.507 --> 33:09.900
grasping for a cause?

33:09.944 --> 33:12.773
Yeah, I think those pretty
pink nails are plenty dirty.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.688
Sorry.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.907
I'm just a sweet little thing.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.170
Remember?

33:25.655 --> 33:27.918
These two murders

33:27.962 --> 33:30.008
will put you away for life.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.010
Go for it.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.837
Try to connect the dots.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.057
I've been
studying for days,

33:36.101 --> 33:38.364
and I certainly
didn't kill anyone.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.324
She's got to be the one.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.370
I mean, maybe she didn't
do it with her own hands,

33:44.413 --> 33:46.067
but she planned it,
she paid for it.

33:46.111 --> 33:50.028
Nope. Definitely not our
Miss Poison Ivy League.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.160
Whoa. It's like
Lisbeth Salander meets

33:52.204 --> 33:54.032
scary Katy Perry.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.511
GIBBS:
Abbs?

33:55.555 --> 33:57.296
She's not the killer, Gibbs.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.037
She's not our killer.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.343
I scrubbed through every
byte of her computer.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.606
She's been a
very bad girl.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.434
She may be
an arms dealer

34:05.478 --> 34:06.522
and may have blown up
the storage locker,

34:06.566 --> 34:08.481
but she only got
a digital copy

34:08.524 --> 34:10.004
of Lieutenant Keeler's book
from Hindley

34:10.048 --> 34:11.397
yesterday.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.486
Casey and Archer
were already dead.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.575
The bad girl couldn't have known
the book was a threat.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.664
ZIVA:
So if the arms deals are not
the reason for the murders,

34:17.707 --> 34:19.796
then what is?

34:39.294 --> 34:42.297
I think that's probably
the same cinnamon roll

34:42.341 --> 34:44.560
that's been here
ever since I first started.

34:44.604 --> 34:45.692
It's looking pretty good
to me right now.

34:53.874 --> 34:56.746
First one in, last one out.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.358
Oorah.

34:59.401 --> 35:02.535
So, I read your book.

35:02.578 --> 35:06.278
I got a copy of it off
of Alexis's computer.

35:06.321 --> 35:09.411
I almost read the whole
thing before I realized

35:09.455 --> 35:11.196
I missed the most
important part--

35:13.328 --> 35:16.026
dedication page.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.334
"For E.A., with love

35:19.378 --> 35:21.380
and thanks for the
happiest days of my life."

35:21.423 --> 35:24.034
I got this off
your hard drive.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.649
Why didn't you tell us you had
an affair with Elise Archer?

35:29.692 --> 35:32.782
It didn't seem right.

35:32.826 --> 35:35.133
Respectful now
that she's gone.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.877
You know, I got this for her.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.792
It's made from sea glass.

35:44.925 --> 35:49.190
When we returned to the
States, she gave it back.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.452
I understood.

35:50.496 --> 35:52.150
You know,
she had her life, a husband.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.328
I just thought maybe
if I waited long enough...

36:04.466 --> 36:05.772
Now I'll never know.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.516
[phone ringing]

36:10.559 --> 36:12.387
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

36:12.431 --> 36:13.693
[Abby speaking over phone]

36:13.736 --> 36:14.694
Yeah, Abbs.

36:14.737 --> 36:15.738
ABBY:
Come to my lab.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.740
Yeah, I'll be
right down.

36:23.006 --> 36:26.096
You knew enough
to love her, Lieutenant.

36:27.794 --> 36:28.838
That's all that matters.

36:38.544 --> 36:40.546
Abbs.

36:40.589 --> 36:41.982
It's "sux," Gibbs!

36:42.025 --> 36:43.810
What sucks?

36:43.853 --> 36:45.290
No, it doesn't suck.

36:45.333 --> 36:48.031
It, it's... it is
"sux"-- S-U-X.

36:48.075 --> 36:50.033
I had to run three
different blood samples

36:50.077 --> 36:51.905
through mass
spec to find it.

36:51.948 --> 36:54.647
I found minute traces
of succinylmonocholine

36:54.690 --> 36:56.257
in Agent Archer's blood.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.738
That's a byproduct
of the muscle relaxant

36:58.781 --> 37:01.741
suxanmenthonium chloride,
AKA sux.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.830
It just, it breaks down
really easily in the blood.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.397
That's why I missed it
the first two times.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.225
Okay, so...?

37:07.268 --> 37:10.967
So, the dose that Agent Archer
was given was so strong

37:11.011 --> 37:12.839
that she was
temporarily paralyzed.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.623
That's why Ducky didn't
find any defensive wounds.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.191
It's not that she
didn't fight back.She couldn't fight back.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.366
Which definitely sucks.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.020
Where does someone get
something like this?

37:20.063 --> 37:21.456
Okay, here's the kicker.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.458
There's so many
undesirable side effects

37:23.502 --> 37:25.721
that it's relegated
to only one specialty.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.723
Emergency medicine.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.774
[siren wailing]

37:45.915 --> 37:48.266
DERRICK:
Hello?

37:48.309 --> 37:50.398
You take us
to the wrong address, J?

37:50.442 --> 37:52.487
Nope.
Man in distress.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.228
Says this is it.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.187
That's me;
I'm in distress.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.276
Or maybe I'm just hungry.

37:58.319 --> 37:59.886
I don't know.

37:59.929 --> 38:01.322
It's hard to tell.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.845
I don't understand.
What are you guys doing here?

38:02.889 --> 38:04.238
We're here
to see you, Derrick.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.240
Archer, what's
this about?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.111
Nothing, Jonny.
Nothing.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.809
FORNELL:
I disagree.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.550
Did you tell your partner
to take some time,

38:11.593 --> 38:13.247
few nights ago--

38:13.291 --> 38:15.336
spend a couple hours with
his girl, off the clock?

38:15.380 --> 38:16.598
He said no one would know.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.339
Yeah.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.646
Jon, go get a coffee.

38:25.999 --> 38:29.045
You asked us why the book
got your wife killed,

38:29.089 --> 38:31.047
but you already knew.

38:31.091 --> 38:34.007
Took the copy right off
her nightstand.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.835
What was that dedication again?

38:35.878 --> 38:37.880
"For E.A.,
with love and thanks.

38:37.924 --> 38:39.273
For the happiest days
of my life."

38:42.145 --> 38:43.712
Derrick Archer,
you're under arrest for murder.

38:45.627 --> 38:48.369
[Derrick grunting]

38:48.413 --> 38:50.763
[groaning]

38:50.806 --> 38:53.722
I gave her a chance
to come clean.

38:53.766 --> 38:57.247
But she denied it, said
it was just a coincidence.

38:57.291 --> 39:01.208
She lied to me, just like
she was always lying to me,

39:01.251 --> 39:03.341
about the job,
about the traveling...

39:03.384 --> 39:04.777
So you
followed her.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.692
You saw she was having dinner
with Patrick Casey.

39:06.735 --> 39:08.302
We picked up your ambulance
on a traffic cam,

39:08.346 --> 39:09.477
half a block away.

39:09.521 --> 39:10.957
Same time they
were eating.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.219
He got what he deserved...

39:12.262 --> 39:13.699
and so did she.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.744
Yeah, well, you
got the wrong guy,

39:15.788 --> 39:17.137
because Casey didn't
write the book,

39:17.180 --> 39:19.400
and he didn't have an
affair with your wife.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.880
They were just tracking down
some missing guns.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.621
Elise found one,
brought it home.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.884
A rifle.
One of a kind.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.581
My agents just found it
in your garage

39:26.625 --> 39:27.713
with your prints all over it.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.018
You want a tip?

39:29.062 --> 39:31.064
You got a problem
with your wife,

39:31.107 --> 39:33.022
get a divorce.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.382
Why are you two
just sitting there?

39:45.992 --> 39:47.646
We're waiting.

39:47.689 --> 39:48.777
Waiting for what?

39:48.821 --> 39:50.562
To see what happens.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.433
To see what happens to whom?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.479
TONY:
Tonight's the
big night, Ziva.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.785
The moment of truth, the
dawn before the big day.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.657
Does Gibbs, the
Grim Reaper of Love,

39:58.700 --> 40:01.355
show up at the rehearsal
dinner of his ex-wife of no?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.661
It's none of
your business, DiNozzo.

40:04.010 --> 40:04.880
[chuckling]

40:06.926 --> 40:07.927
You headed out, boss?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.581
Yeah.
Got a couple things to do.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.234
Toasts are my specialty.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.628
If you need me.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.282
Okay.
You've got it, boss.

40:15.325 --> 40:18.416
Of course.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.548
He's going.

40:26.989 --> 40:29.209
[door opens, shuts]

40:31.167 --> 40:32.691
Hey, we're already
an hour late.

40:32.734 --> 40:33.779
You're not
even dressed.

40:36.564 --> 40:38.218
You're not going.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.350
I was never going.

40:40.394 --> 40:41.700
[sighs heavily]

40:41.743 --> 40:43.092
Who the hell am I trying to kid?

40:43.136 --> 40:44.267
I don't want to go, either.

40:44.311 --> 40:46.661
Eh.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.228
She'll understand.
[laughs]

40:48.271 --> 40:50.012
Yeah, right. Like hell.

40:50.056 --> 40:51.231
Good point.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.885
You know who the new guy is?

40:54.800 --> 40:55.975
[laughing]:
Homeland Security.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.935
She'll never learn.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.678
So what now?

41:03.722 --> 41:05.158
All dressed up, nowhere to go.

41:05.201 --> 41:06.942
You just going
to keep working?
Yup.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.683
Till the pizza comes.

41:08.727 --> 41:11.294
Pepperoni and onions?

41:11.338 --> 41:12.339
Mm-hmm.

41:12.382 --> 41:14.254
[doorbell rings]

41:15.385 --> 41:17.213
It's on me.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.783
Hey, Gibbs...

41:24.830 --> 41:26.919
I just gave away the bride.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.054
You have a beautiful
daughter, Tobias.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.364
Break out the
mason jars.

41:37.407 --> 41:38.234
I'll drink to that.

41:43.718 --> 41:46.329
Amen.
