08:09.056 --> 08:10.388

08:12.059 --> 08:13.358

08:23.604 --> 08:24.669

08:24.738 --> 08:25.804
- What should we do with Ange?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.205
- She said she likes him.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.273
- She does like him.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.541
- I don't know, man.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.009
I think she's falling
for the Keto Guido.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.410

08:32.479 --> 08:34.513

Honey, looks like we
got something important

10:47.714 --> 10:48.913

10:50.017 --> 10:51.349

- Stop it.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.651
Really?
- Yeah.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.285
- Can you say?
- I can't announce it.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.654
- Wait, is it a boy or a girl?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.122
- Yeah, are you going
to get pink or blue stuff?

10:57.190 --> 10:58.590
- I cannot say.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.258

tell nobody that you told us.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.274
- Yeah, we're not
going to tell anybody.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.777

it's another boy?

11:18.845 --> 11:20.111
- Are you happy it's a boy?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.980
- Are you happy that he
has a little brother?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.214
- Does it have a penis?

11:23.283 --> 11:24.482
- Me and Lauren
haven't officially

11:24.551 --> 11:26.151
announced the gender,
because I want

11:26.219 --> 11:28.353
to have a true gender reveal.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.055
- Wait, what are you having,
a boy or a girl?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.656

brother or a little sister?

pissed if you slipped?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.745
We did it, honey.

11:53.814 --> 11:54.979

11:58.251 --> 11:59.951
- We did it.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.519
- It's a girl!

12:01.588 --> 12:03.254
- It's a girl!

12:03.323 --> 12:05.256
- Do you have any names?
- I can't say.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.558
- All right, I have--

12:06.626 --> 12:08.259
I have a name that you
might name your son.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.228
- Okay, what is it?

12:10.297 --> 12:11.229
- Oh!

12:11.298 --> 12:12.430
- No, no, no, no.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.665
- He tripped up.

12:13.734 --> 12:14.733
He tripped up.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.302
- He said it. He said it.
- Oh.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.603
- What was said?

12:18.672 --> 12:19.738
- He tripped up.

12:19.806 --> 12:20.872
- [bleep]

12:20.941 --> 12:22.140
- Your face is red.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.441
- Listen, be surprised, okay?

12:23.543 --> 12:24.642
- He's upset with her.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.010
- Be surprised at
the gender reveal.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.046
- Oh, 100%.
- Be surprised.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.181
- [gasps] Oh, [bleep].
- 100%.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.585
- I thought the gender reveal
was for the parents

12:33.653 --> 12:35.186
to find out the gender.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.222
- Now, it's time to plan
a gender reveal--

12:37.290 --> 12:38.990
- I'm in shock.
- --with the squad.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.225
- Whoo.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.760
- All right, can I jump
out of a plane?

12:41.828 --> 12:42.794
- [laughs] What?

12:42.863 --> 12:43.828
- Can I jump out of a plane?

12:43.897 --> 12:44.929
- No.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.865
- Mike and Lauren
know the gender.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.267
So they just do gender reveals
for other people.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.535
- But you know
with the second one,

12:50.604 --> 12:52.036
you're not even supposed
to do a gender reveal.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.171
- You know that.
- Oh, really?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.672
- You don't go crazy.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.475
- A gender reveal is, like,
considered, like, my thing.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.911
So it probably would
be sort of big.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.647
- My money don't jiggle-jiggle.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.115
- What, are you like
a DJ or something?

13:04.184 --> 13:05.717
- In my past life.
- Oh, cool.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.851
Weren't you an EMT?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.019
- You were an EMT?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.687
- I was trying
to be a firefighter.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.256
In order to be a firefighter
you have to be an EMT--

13:11.324 --> 13:12.390
- Holy [bleep].
- And I got my EMT, yeah.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.192
- Oh, I could see that.
- No way.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.660
- So I went to school
to be a firefighter,

13:15.729 --> 13:17.395
then I got a call to go
to "Jersey Shore"

13:17.464 --> 13:18.863
for 30 days.
- What's that?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.999
- Oh, my God.
And then it just--

13:21.067 --> 13:23.368
- How did you guys hear about
the "Jersey Shore" casting?

13:23.436 --> 13:24.636
- I was in Brooklyn
at a nightclub,

13:24.704 --> 13:25.737
and somebody
tapped my shoulder.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.105
I was like, who the
[bleep] is this?

13:27.174 --> 13:28.273
And then she gave me her card.
She said, come tomorrow.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.641
I was like, all right.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.543
I am the Kim Kardashian
of Staten Island, baby.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.845
You guys ready to party
with me this summer?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.180
I'm ready to go wild.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.315
- I get a phone call,
and then they were like,

13:37.384 --> 13:38.750
oh, we like your look
for a show,

13:38.819 --> 13:40.185
wanna film a day in your life.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.352
I'm like, all right.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.720
They come to my house,
and they're like,

13:42.789 --> 13:43.955
this kid's the real deal.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.623
He has an Italian flag tattoo
on his back,

13:45.692 --> 13:47.158
and he has an Italian flag
above his bed.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.927
I was born and raised a Guido.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.728
It's just a lifestyle.
It's being Italian.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.364
It's representing family,
friends,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.099
tanning, gel, everything.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.267
- How'd you get on the show?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.403
- A friend of mine sent me
the application,

13:58.471 --> 13:59.604
and then I filled it out.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.139
And I was like,
I don't have a tan.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.106
I don't have muscles.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.374
I'm a Guido.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.343
Most people might
consider being a Guido

14:05.412 --> 14:06.578
like you're stupid,

14:06.646 --> 14:09.414
but I went to school,
graduated college.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.015
That doesn't shy
away from, say,

14:11.084 --> 14:12.617
I don't have fun at night,
you know what I mean?

14:12.686 --> 14:15.153
And I party and fist pump
like the best of them.

14:15.222 --> 14:20.725
- My casting tape was going out
with the Gotti boys at a club.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.093
- Oh, yeah, she's with Carmine.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.329
- How embarrassing.
- Dancing with Carmine.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.197
- I am like a praying mantis.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.300
After I have sex with a guy,
I will rip their heads off.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.269
Let the party begin, bitch.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.605
- How about you?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.974
- You were the first guy
casted on the show.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.976

She would not do that.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.509
- I'm going to bed.

21:51.577 --> 21:52.576
One more time,
I'm going to bed.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.578
I swear of God,
I'm going to bed.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.680
I get really mad
when you do that.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.214
I love you.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.983
- But Jesus Christ, I don't
have to hear that every time.

21:59.052 --> 21:59.984
Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.252
I should make the fire.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.453
- We have to?

22:02.522 --> 22:03.487
Okay.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.588
- Do you have a match?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.490
- No, I don't have a match.
Okay.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.626
- Oh, my God. Ooh.
- Whoo.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.094
- Ooh, there is bug in my eye.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.595
- No, there's not.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.596
What?

22:12.665 --> 22:13.698
- How did we start this?

22:13.766 --> 22:15.399
- Where's that box?

22:15.468 --> 22:18.135
- Fire, let it be lit.

22:18.204 --> 22:19.370
- Let it rain.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.471
- Oh, yeah, get a branch.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.472
- What am I doing?

22:21.541 --> 22:22.640
We're so stupid.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.209
- Oh, [bleep].

22:25.278 --> 22:27.144
- Jamie.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.779
- Sit down and
enjoy your drink.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.181
- Maybe it's the wind.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.248
- It's definitely the wind.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.249
- Wait, watch your--no.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.818
Shut your hair, bitch.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.086
Everything you've
seen in the movies

22:35.154 --> 22:38.022
about lighting a fire or
the house going on fire

22:38.091 --> 22:39.523
so quickly, it's all lies.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.292
I would never want
to be a caveman--

22:41.361 --> 22:43.027
a caveman, ever, because--
- [bleep]

22:43.096 --> 22:44.261
- I'd be [bleep] right now.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.931
I honestly got to give props
to the cavemen

22:47.033 --> 22:50.134
because this [bleep]
is extra hard.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.535
- Come on.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.603
- Go, go, go.

22:52.672 --> 22:53.938
- Yeah, do you have some money?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.339
- What, are you [bleep] nuts?

22:55.408 --> 22:56.874
- At this point, I don't
even know what we're burning,

22:56.943 --> 22:58.342
but we're trying
to burn everything

22:58.411 --> 22:59.777
to get this fire going.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.979
I did Girl Scouts
for, like, a year.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.914
- How do you not know how
to make a fire then, Nicole?

23:04.016 --> 23:05.483
- Because I only
sold cookies, bitch.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.618
- I'm dead.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.553
- Ange, I feel like we've
been here for two hours.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.389
- I want a fire pit.

23:11.457 --> 23:14.091
- [groans]
- Now the box will set on fire.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.093
- We made fire!

23:16.162 --> 23:17.261
- Whoo! We did.

23:17.330 --> 23:18.629
- [bleep]
[cheering]

23:18.698 --> 23:20.364
- We made a fire!

23:21.934 --> 23:23.434
- I'm, like,
so happy with myself.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.635
- We made a fire.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.337
- I cannot believe it.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.339
We lit that [bleep] fire.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.374
- Cheers to making
our first fire.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.475
- Cheers.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.444
- You did it, Ange.
- Thank you.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.479
- Let's do a truth or dare,
but we're doing truth.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.448
Do you want to [bleep] Vinny?

23:37.517 --> 23:38.482
You like Vinny.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.483
- I've known Vinny
for a long time.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.652
I've always liked
him like that.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.588
I would say, yeah,
I think he's very funny.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.323
Sometimes he makes me
laugh more than others.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.560
- Left, right, side to side,
left, right, side to side.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.028
- [laughs]

23:51.097 --> 23:53.731
I haven't seen bombing that
bad since World War II.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.699
- [laughs]

23:55.768 --> 23:56.967
- You like him.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.436
Just say you like him.
- I like him.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.171
I like him, but I think
we have to put it to rest

24:00.239 --> 24:03.140
because it's all about fate.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.876
And I also feel like we're not
destined to be together, like,

24:05.945 --> 24:07.311
or [bleep] each other again.

24:07.380 --> 24:08.946
- Angelina obviously
likes Vinny,

24:09.015 --> 24:10.714
but I feel like she's
not going to pursue it.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.916
- I'm good.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.885
I can find whoever I want,
whenever I want.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.153
You know what I mean?

24:16.222 --> 24:18.088
- I feel like we should
put this fire out.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.623
There's a fire
extinguisher over there.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.392
- Over there, there is.
Be careful.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.560
- What do you do?
- I don't know.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.561
We have to figure it out.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.562
- Bonk.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.564
You're an EMT.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.265
Show me how you do it.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.602
[laughter]

24:33.272 --> 24:34.338
[laughter]

24:35.408 --> 24:36.707
I'm a firefighter.

24:36.776 --> 24:37.875
- To light the fire,
it's really,

24:37.944 --> 24:39.176
really, really hard, right?

24:39.245 --> 24:42.246
To put it out, you make
it very easy, baby.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.648
- Burn, baby, burn.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.817
- Stop. [inaudible].

24:46.886 --> 24:48.352
We did it.
That's all that matters.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.020
That [bleep] is so hard.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.288
- It's very hard.

24:51.357 --> 24:54.658
My father--my father
was a firefighter.

24:54.727 --> 24:55.826
- I was an EMT.
- So I didn't think

24:55.895 --> 24:57.361
it was gonna be that dramatic.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.929
- Whoever--whoever
made up those

24:58.998 --> 25:01.632
fire starter [bleep] sticks--

25:03.236 --> 25:04.535
- [gasps]

25:06.839 --> 25:08.405
- Okay. She's mad.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.543
- She's trying to sleep.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.245
Jenni just screamed at us.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.046
- Whatever.
- She's mad at us.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.314
- Who gives a [bleep]?

25:17.383 --> 25:18.516
Whoo-hoo!

25:18.584 --> 25:21.118
- Are you not scared
of that yell?

25:21.187 --> 25:23.287
- When you say you're [bleep]
done, be [bleep] done.

25:23.356 --> 25:24.788
Grimy? Grimy?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.657
You wanna talk about
[bleep] grimy?

25:26.726 --> 25:27.725
I'm not done!

25:27.793 --> 25:28.959
- She don't scare me.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.160
- Quiet!

25:30.229 --> 25:31.562
- She's screaming.
- Is she coming out?

25:31.631 --> 25:33.063
- I'm really scared of Jenni.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.221
[groans]

25:58.357 --> 25:59.390
- Good morning, Vin.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.891
- Good morning.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.192
What time were you up till?

26:02.261 --> 26:03.227
- 2:30.

26:03.296 --> 26:04.762
- Hi, Vin.
Hi, Ange.

26:06.299 --> 26:08.632
- After seeing Angelina
and Vinny this trip,

26:08.701 --> 26:10.134
they just need to be together.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.802
- Well, I smelled bacon,

26:11.871 --> 26:14.638
and I knew Vincent must
be close by.

26:14.707 --> 26:15.806
Ange, you're cooking breakfast?

26:15.875 --> 26:16.941
All right.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.143
Maybe this is exactly
what Vinny needs,

26:19.211 --> 26:22.079
you know, a woman to cook
for him from Staten Island,

26:22.148 --> 26:23.781
not afraid to--

26:23.849 --> 26:27.284
to whip him into shape or
choke the [bleep] out of him.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.519
- Why is it smoky?

26:28.588 --> 26:30.287
- Angelina's cooking breakfast.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.455
- You cooked?
- Yes.

26:31.524 --> 26:32.690
- Yeah.
- You're alive?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.325
- I'm alive.
- Look at what she set up.

26:34.393 --> 26:35.392
Angelina made breakfast?

26:35.461 --> 26:37.161
How is this bitch alive?

26:37.229 --> 26:38.662
Wow, thanks, Ange.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.030
Angelina has makeup on.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.899
She's like ready to go,
cooking breakfast.

26:41.968 --> 26:42.900
What are you on?

26:42.969 --> 26:44.001
Like, you're crazy.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.436
How are you alive?
- I don't know.

26:45.504 --> 26:46.503
How are you alive?

26:46.572 --> 26:48.539
- You were [bleep]
banging [bleep],

26:48.608 --> 26:51.175
like, pots and pans till,
like, 3:00 in the morning.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.776
Did you hear me scream?

26:54.847 --> 26:55.779
- Sorry.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.214
- No, you're not.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.616
- I feel like after the
confessional, we went to bed.

26:58.718 --> 26:59.883
- We did.
- Yeah.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.452
- What was that time, 3:00?

27:01.520 --> 27:03.053
- No, they went to--they went
to bed at, like, 2:30 or 3:00.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.521
- You were still up?

27:04.590 --> 27:06.557
- I was eating chips in my bed.
[laughter]

27:06.626 --> 27:08.258
- He was eating his feelings.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.593
- I was.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.562
- How do you feel today after--
- I feel good.

27:11.631 --> 27:12.930
You know, I slept off
that negativity.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.198
- It's a lot of pressure.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.034
- Life happens,
and I got to accept that L.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.203
- I feel like I didn't
even realize that cornhole

27:19.271 --> 27:20.537
was an actual sport.

27:20.606 --> 27:22.806
Like, I have respect
for cornhole now.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.542
- Guys, we went through
a lot on this trip.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.444
- A lot of [bleep].
- One day.

27:27.513 --> 27:28.512
- A lot of [bleep].

27:28.581 --> 27:30.147
- Relax.
Let's go pack.

27:30.216 --> 27:31.348
- Let's go.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.084
- What an amazing trip
it has been.

27:34.153 --> 27:39.189
Operation Gym Tan Cornhole
is complete.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.491
We'll see you next time.

27:40.559 --> 27:41.892
- You done packing?

27:41.961 --> 27:43.027
- Basically.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.897
- So what should
we do with Ange?

27:46.966 --> 27:48.198
- She said she likes him.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.400
- She does like him.

27:49.468 --> 27:50.634
- I don't know, man.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.269
I think she's falling
for the Keto Guido

27:52.338 --> 27:54.104
or maybe she wants to revisit--
- Me? What?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.140
- Me and Angeliners
need some privacy.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.775
- If she ever really
felt like that,

27:57.843 --> 28:00.010
I can have a conversation
with her about it.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.645
- We'll just make it,
like, a fun girls' day

28:01.747 --> 28:03.580
so she doesn't know.

28:03.649 --> 28:04.848
And then be like,
"Listen, bitch,

28:04.917 --> 28:07.418
we're doing a date
with you and Vin."

28:07.486 --> 28:09.753
- I think she is trying to,
like, work on herself--

28:09.822 --> 28:11.255
- Yeah.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.224
- To soften because that's
what she thinks that you want.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.492
- I never say never in life.

28:15.561 --> 28:16.894
You never know what can happen.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.495
Like, I don't believe
in absolutes.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.531
So there's, like,
a small chance

28:20.599 --> 28:21.832
that something will happen.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.868
If you sleep with somebody
that you live with

28:24.937 --> 28:27.204
and work with or whatever,
it kind of, like,

28:27.273 --> 28:28.706
muddies the waters a lot.

28:28.774 --> 28:30.274
- I want to do
the "Lady and the Tramp,"

28:30.342 --> 28:31.608
though, like, dinner for them.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.010
Like, the candle,

28:33.079 --> 28:34.445
The little circle table.
- Stop.

28:34.513 --> 28:35.713
And then we're in her ear.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.082
- As time goes by
and you continue

28:38.150 --> 28:40.451
to live in ratchet city--
- Yeah.

28:40.519 --> 28:43.020
- The availability
of options become

28:43.089 --> 28:44.922
limited for settling down.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.257
And Angelina gonna be
sitting there waiting.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.859
Both of y'all gonna be there.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.360
- Her options are limited.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.130
- Both of y'all going to be
sitting in that boat together.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.999
And then, next
thing you know it--

28:56.068 --> 28:59.036
- If she starts
to be my type, I'm down.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.838
- So you're saying
there's a chance.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.206
- You never know what

I have to talk to somebody.

It was crazy.

Mike lost, unfortunately.

- But he did really good.

- Okay, that's fun.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.660
How's the rest of the vibe?

37:43.729 --> 37:45.929
- You know, I got
a little drunk.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.431
And you know how I always
play games with, like, Vin.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.134
Me and him have that,
like, [bleep] up banter.

37:51.203 --> 37:52.602
- Yeah, it's kind of ongoing.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.405
- Vinny and I have been
flirty for so long.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.873
It's just, like, what we do.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.241
We flirt back and forth.

37:58.310 --> 38:01.144
We've been doing
this for decades.

38:01.213 --> 38:02.779
- You [bleep] like him.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.648
You like him. Just say it.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.349
- I mean, I've always
liked him like that.

38:06.418 --> 38:08.218
- Vinny puts this whole
front on

38:08.287 --> 38:10.186
when he's in front
of the roommates.

38:10.255 --> 38:12.989
But when it's just me and him,
he's actually nice to me

38:13.058 --> 38:14.124
when we're alone.

38:14.192 --> 38:15.792
In the car ride
to the airport,

38:15.861 --> 38:18.161
he admits that if
I wasn't that drunk,

38:18.230 --> 38:19.696
he would have tried
to hook up with me.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.737
- [bleep]

38:27.806 --> 38:29.572
Damn it, alcohol.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.108
I feel like everybody in this
world wants it to happen.

38:32.177 --> 38:33.643
We are the only single ones.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.245
- It's like a bond, you know?

38:35.314 --> 38:36.846
- Well, we have a bond,
you know, but he doesn't

38:36.915 --> 38:38.014
like to show it too much.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.250
But when we're alone,
he's very nice.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.551
He's extra nice to me.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.653
He's actually the Vinny
I like when we're alone.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.522
So you have three
different Vinnys:

38:45.590 --> 38:47.891
when he's with the roommates,
when he's with me,

38:47.959 --> 38:49.092
and when he drinks.

38:49.161 --> 38:52.629
He's not the same at all
in any of the three.

38:52.698 --> 38:56.466
I wish I could have alone Vinny
and drunk Vinny in one night.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.301
I just would love to see
what would happen.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.336
I want realness.

I don't want fake anymore.

39:00.605 --> 39:01.671
And that's just it.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.206

what you deserve.

39:03.275 --> 39:04.607
Maybe you should
give him a chance.

to [bleep] me.
