WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.431
You fuckin' lagged.
What are you talking about?

00:02.551 --> 00:05.591
She'd didn't tell Ferguson!
Franky, it was me!

00:05.607 --> 00:07.968
What?
It was me.

00:08.269 --> 00:12.630
If you ever come back to Wentworth,

00:12.817 --> 00:14.617
I will kill you myself.

00:14.698 --> 00:16.178
I want to go into protection.

00:20.777 --> 00:23.057
I could use someone
like you on my crew.

00:23.178 --> 00:26.498
Your husband gave me
these for you to sign.

00:28.138 --> 00:29.818
He fancies himself.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.537
Fancies you, too.

00:33.537 --> 00:36.338
It's positive.
Do we know who it belongs to?

00:36.457 --> 00:39.898
No. I've organised for testing of
all inmates to begin immediately.

00:39.978 --> 00:41.698
Did you hear about the urine test?

00:41.817 --> 00:44.537
Yeah, so? Won't they be able to tell
you're pregnant?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.257 --> 01:57.498
Are you pregnant?

01:57.578 --> 02:01.337
What? No!

02:15.337 --> 02:20.497
I'm going to ask you...
one more time.

02:22.258 --> 02:27.858
Are... you... pregnant?

02:33.177 --> 02:36.177
Get off me! Get off!
I haven't done anything!

02:36.298 --> 02:42.497
Please! Please! Get off me!
What the fuck's goin' on?

02:42.578 --> 02:45.177
I haven't done anything! Please!

02:45.258 --> 02:48.538
Help! Get off me! Get off!

03:00.177 --> 03:03.737
The sooner you produce a sample, the
sooner you can return to your unit.

03:03.858 --> 03:08.497
I can't. There must be a mistake,
Miss Ferguson...

03:08.657 --> 03:13.098
The only mistake, Anderson, was the inmate
you chose for your substitute urine.

03:13.177 --> 03:16.258
I didn't, I swear. I just...

03:16.377 --> 03:18.497
The laboratory found an anomaly
with your specimen.

03:18.578 --> 03:21.737
We know you're hiding something.

03:24.377 --> 03:26.138
I can stand here all night
if I have to,

03:26.217 --> 03:28.337
so I suggest you get on with it.

03:59.578 --> 04:02.418
It's positive.

04:22.057 --> 04:24.737
The women hate me.

04:24.817 --> 04:26.778
It's because you're special.

04:26.858 --> 04:31.497
Yeah, only to you.

04:33.778 --> 04:35.658
I'm scared.

04:35.737 --> 04:39.098
I promised you, I'll protect you.

04:51.177 --> 04:54.177
Governor? Governor?

04:56.418 --> 04:58.858
What do you want done
with the prisoner?

05:12.817 --> 05:15.538
Fuckin' Darth Vader
and her stormies.

05:15.658 --> 05:18.177
I swear that bitch
has got sand in her snatch.

05:18.298 --> 05:20.617
All that screaming, I thought
someone was gettin' murdered.

05:21.577 --> 05:23.978
Yeah, and I was having
a really good dream, too, eh.

05:24.098 --> 05:26.458
It's not funny, Boomer.
What's she gonna do to ya?

05:26.577 --> 05:30.177
Gonna fuck up his parole if they
find out it was Nashy's splooge.

05:32.778 --> 05:36.898
Hey, what's wrong with your piss?
What?

05:37.017 --> 05:39.658
Yeah, I was tested again
cos of the piss you gave me.

05:39.778 --> 05:44.257
You told me you were clean.
I am. It's just... It wasn't my wee.

05:44.338 --> 05:48.697
Then whose was it? Maxine's.

05:48.778 --> 05:51.338
Maxine's pregnant?

06:00.697 --> 06:03.778
Moving you back
is a calculated risk.

06:03.898 --> 06:08.017
She'll see you as a threat,
but it will unsettle her, too.

06:08.098 --> 06:10.177
Create opportunity.

06:10.298 --> 06:12.858
It's in your best interests
to strike first.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.898
Alright.

06:15.017 --> 06:19.858
But when I take her down,
I'll do it when I'm ready.

06:19.978 --> 06:22.418
I'm simply telling you, I can put
you back into Doyle's orbit,

06:22.442 --> 06:24.497
but I cannot be seen to interfere
in any other way.

06:24.617 --> 06:30.497
You've made the right decision,
Smith.

06:39.577 --> 06:41.658
No fuckin' way!

06:41.737 --> 06:44.017
Home sweet home, Red.

06:57.538 --> 07:01.458
What's your plan, Red?
There's no plan.

07:03.538 --> 07:06.898
Problem is,
I don't fuckin' believe you.

07:08.858 --> 07:10.737
This about our
little misunderstanding?

07:10.858 --> 07:15.298
It wasn't so little.
This stinks of Ferguson.

07:18.497 --> 07:20.737
You can't trust that bitch, Red.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.458
What, you think I trust her when
she put me back in here with you?

07:24.338 --> 07:28.497
It comes down to play between us,
and it's your guts on the floor.

07:28.617 --> 07:32.577
So, why wait?
Let's smash it right fuckin' now.

07:32.697 --> 07:35.218
You are so wrong.
I'm no threat to you.

07:36.778 --> 07:38.817
You got that fuckin' right.

07:43.737 --> 07:46.577
Have you seen Bea?
Over there.

07:48.937 --> 07:51.858
Bea, you've gotta come.
Maxine's going ape shit.

07:51.937 --> 07:53.937
Shit!

07:58.658 --> 08:02.338
Maxine? Hey! Hey, stop it...

08:02.418 --> 08:04.057
Get off me!

08:04.137 --> 08:06.858
You try and keep the screws away.

08:06.978 --> 08:11.218
Stop stop stop stop!
Hey, hey, stop.

08:11.298 --> 08:14.177
It's OK. Shoosh, it's OK.

08:14.257 --> 08:15.658
It's me.

08:15.778 --> 08:19.697
Come on, you're alright.
What happened?

08:19.778 --> 08:22.617
What happened?

08:22.697 --> 08:25.497
They stopped my HRT.

08:25.617 --> 08:28.577
I gave my urine to Jess
and she gave it to Doreen.

08:28.658 --> 08:29.937
Did someone lag?

08:30.018 --> 08:31.778
No, the lab picked it up.

08:31.898 --> 08:35.298
It's got a unique drug signature,
apparently. It's all the...

08:35.378 --> 08:38.857
It's all the hormones I take.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.018
Do you know what will happen
if I stop taking my meds?

08:46.452 --> 08:48.985
Shh, it's OK. It's OK.

08:50.498 --> 08:52.817
Come here. Look at me.

08:55.258 --> 08:58.937
You know Ferguson's not the only
one who can source drugs in here.

09:02.258 --> 09:04.817
Franky? No.

09:04.937 --> 09:07.418
But she's gonna want something
in return.

09:09.057 --> 09:11.817
Honey,
do you want those meds or not?

09:37.011 --> 09:39.905
See, I don't make
the rules, Mr Smith.

09:39.984 --> 09:41.512
I'm just underpaid to enforce them.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.401
Yeah, stuff your rules.
I wanna see her.

09:43.563 --> 09:47.301
You should have scheduled a visit.
You've been here enough times,
Mr Smith, to know procedure.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.835
You fill this in, we'll see
what we can do for you next week.

09:49.860 --> 09:52.608
No no no, look, I'm here now.

09:52.688 --> 09:55.985
Oi, you. I wanna see Bea Smith.

09:56.106 --> 09:58.920
Well, I doubt that Bea
would want to see you.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.538
And how would you know
what my wife wants? Ex-wife.

10:02.617 --> 10:04.507
Fine.

10:04.587 --> 10:06.196
But I'm not going anywhere.

10:06.317 --> 10:11.421
You can tell that bitch that I'm
gonna dump all her shit in the tip.

10:11.501 --> 10:12.990
Yeah, you tell her.

10:13.111 --> 10:17.934
Overweight passengers on
airlines pay more for their seats.

10:18.095 --> 10:21.352
Now, for some people, this argument comes
down to a very simple matter of maths.

10:21.431 --> 10:23.481
They say...

10:23.602 --> 10:28.547
Hey, I heard about this morning.
Are you alright?

10:28.668 --> 10:32.326
I'm so sorry, Doreen.
I didn't know.

10:32.407 --> 10:34.737
It's not your fault.

10:37.995 --> 10:42.054
You sure you're OK? Yeah, they were
going to find out sooner or later, so...

10:42.135 --> 10:45.391
Smith. Outside.

10:52.466 --> 10:54.837
Hey, your ex is here to see you.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.572
What does he want?
Well, he's selling the house,

10:57.693 --> 10:59.903
and packed all your stuff.
So?

11:00.065 --> 11:03.400
He said he's going to pay a month's rent
on a storage unit, but won't pay any more.

11:03.521 --> 11:06.215
Yeah, well, you tell him
to put it in a letter.

11:06.295 --> 11:08.827
So, you're back at H2?

11:08.908 --> 11:10.476
Excuse me.

11:10.556 --> 11:12.888
Anderson? Come with me.

11:21.652 --> 11:23.582
Just be careful.
OK.

11:25.712 --> 11:29.572
I can't begin to tell you
how disappointed I am.

11:29.692 --> 11:32.666
You're a peer worker. You are meant
to be an example to the other women.

11:32.787 --> 11:35.521
I gave you the garden project, and
you turn around and do this to me.

11:35.642 --> 11:38.014
I didn't mean to disappoint you,
Miss Ferguson...

11:38.134 --> 11:41.310
As Governor, Anderson, every breach
of the rules disappoints me.

11:43.159 --> 11:44.687
Who's the father?

11:47.098 --> 11:48.667
Who is responsible?

11:48.746 --> 11:50.636
I am.

12:00.927 --> 12:05.511
Who... is... the father?

12:13.832 --> 12:17.691
You can hit me again,
but I ain't saying.

12:38.876 --> 12:43.901
Ms Bennett?
Take her back to her work unit.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.454
Ms Bennett?
Wait there, Anderson.

12:54.636 --> 12:57.609
It's either an officer
or a prisoner from Walford.

12:57.691 --> 12:59.299
Find out who.

13:05.731 --> 13:07.821
He's gonna grow up without a dad.

13:10.072 --> 13:12.524
He doesn't need one.

13:12.605 --> 13:14.172
I've got nobody now.

13:14.292 --> 13:18.353
I'm all alone. Don't say that.
You're not.

13:20.483 --> 13:24.786
You don't have to be alone. Ever.

13:27.358 --> 13:29.972
Little bugger kicked.

13:31.659 --> 13:33.348
Can you feel it?

13:50.473 --> 13:52.042
She doesn't want to see you.

13:52.162 --> 13:54.574
She wants you to put all the details
in a letter.

13:54.654 --> 13:55.941
No, that's bullshit.

13:56.062 --> 13:59.077
I have every right to see her. I was
married to her for 16 bloody years.

13:59.197 --> 14:01.689
And you divorced her.
What would you know about that?

14:01.809 --> 14:04.504
Well, I know that Bea's
better off without you.

14:04.624 --> 14:06.273
Do you think I don't know
what's going on?

14:06.297 --> 14:08.201
What's going on?
You and my wife, mate...

14:08.283 --> 14:09.247
Ex-wife.

14:09.368 --> 14:11.739
She was still my wife
when you started fucking her.

14:11.901 --> 14:16.000
Right, get out. Well, he's not
bloody denying it, is he?
I'm ordering you off the premises.

14:16.162 --> 14:19.941
I knew last time I was here
there was something going on.
Leave now. Don't fuckin' touch me!

14:20.020 --> 14:21.025
Get out!

14:22.594 --> 14:24.402
Alright.

14:27.538 --> 14:31.075
You tell her this is
where our daughter is.

14:33.849 --> 14:37.146
This isn't fuckin' over, mate!

14:50.091 --> 14:54.634
Oi! You're a dead man, Smith!

14:57.688 --> 15:01.105
Oh, you alright, Will?
Oh, what was all that for?

15:06.935 --> 15:09.789
The garden project.
What about it?

15:12.039 --> 15:15.578
Did Doreen Anderson have time alone
with any of the male prisoners?

15:15.699 --> 15:18.029
If she did, I wouldn't have
been doing my job properly.

15:18.150 --> 15:21.487
Well, that's already
been established.

15:21.608 --> 15:23.859
Did you allow any
inappropriate fraternisation?

15:23.939 --> 15:26.794
I don't know. Define inappropriate.

15:29.568 --> 15:32.583
Jesus, Vera. Lighten up.
Don't patronise me.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.129
This is about me and Fletch,
isn't it?

15:41.829 --> 15:44.000
Let me be clear.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.979
If you say nothing now, and I
discover there was such contact,

15:48.099 --> 15:50.150
whether you were complicit
or simply negligent,

15:50.271 --> 15:52.320
there will be severe consequences
for your career,

15:52.401 --> 15:55.175
so I will ask you again.

15:55.296 --> 16:00.803
Officer Miles, were you aware
of any incorrect relations

16:00.924 --> 16:03.979
between Anderson
and a Walford prisoner?

16:13.748 --> 16:15.234
Yes?

16:16.842 --> 16:18.450
Governor, have you got a minute?

16:18.532 --> 16:20.742
Of course, Mr Jackson.

16:22.591 --> 16:25.929
Um, I want to report an accusation

16:26.049 --> 16:28.259
that was made against me
by a member of the public.

16:28.341 --> 16:29.868
Go on?

16:29.949 --> 16:32.481
Ah, the prisoner, Bea Smith.

16:32.641 --> 16:37.627
Her ex-husband arrived for an unscheduled
visit and, when it was denied,

16:37.747 --> 16:41.726
he accused me of having an
inappropriate relationship with her.

16:44.741 --> 16:48.159
And you are reporting this to me
because?

16:48.320 --> 16:51.174
He made the accusation at the
visitors' reception in front of witnesses.

16:51.295 --> 16:53.466
And there's no truth in it?
Of course not, Governor.

16:56.963 --> 16:59.816
You are one of my finest officers.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.439
Put in a full report. I'll lodge
it formally with the department.

17:04.521 --> 17:06.047
Anything else?

17:06.169 --> 17:10.269
I think he could be responsible for
a campaign of harassment against me.

17:10.349 --> 17:11.273
Really?

17:11.395 --> 17:13.968
What sort of harassment?
Threatening texts.

17:14.088 --> 17:17.223
Malicious damage to my bike,
and my house was ransacked.

17:17.344 --> 17:19.474
And you have proof of this
for the police? No.

17:19.595 --> 17:22.530
Yes?

17:22.651 --> 17:26.550
Well, as I said, I suggest you file
a report. Just to protect yourself.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.721
Thank you, Mr Jackson.

17:30.409 --> 17:31.896
Yes, Vera?

17:33.787 --> 17:35.797
I know who it is.

18:30.922 --> 18:33.054
Nash Taylor.

18:35.425 --> 18:37.596
Did he rape you?

18:37.676 --> 18:40.169
No.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.219
No, we love each other.

18:42.340 --> 18:47.485
Mm, well, that must be
very disconcerting.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.777
He's up for parole,

18:49.898 --> 18:53.355
with two years of a suspended
sentence hanging over him.

18:53.475 --> 18:58.018
Two extra years
for two sweaty minutes.

18:58.099 --> 19:01.114
No, please.

19:01.234 --> 19:03.565
Please don't say anything,
Miss Ferguson...

19:03.687 --> 19:09.274
But I have to, Doreen. I can't leave
a prisoner's pregnancy unexplained.

19:14.460 --> 19:16.590
Of course...

19:19.846 --> 19:22.620
you might be lying to me.

19:22.742 --> 19:25.917
To protect someone else?
What?

19:26.038 --> 19:29.414
I mean, who's to say that
Mr Taylor's the responsible party?

19:31.988 --> 19:39.867
You know, it's not unknown for a prison
officer to seduce someone under their charge.

19:39.987 --> 19:45.695
In fact, I'm currently dealing
with just such an accusation,

19:45.776 --> 19:47.464
against Mr Jackson.

19:52.047 --> 19:58.841
What, you... you want me to say -
Mr Jackson got me pregnant?

20:00.047 --> 20:04.952
I'd hate to see your young man spend another
two years in jail for something he didn't do.

20:14.639 --> 20:17.535
Mr Jackson? Are you sure
that's what she was saying?

20:17.614 --> 20:19.263
Yeah.

20:19.423 --> 20:23.766
I mean, she didn't say it outright like I had
to, but that's what she was getting at.

20:23.926 --> 20:26.218
Well, what has she got
against Will Jackson? I don't know.

20:26.258 --> 20:28.871
Oh, well it must be some
sort of political hoo-ha.

20:28.991 --> 20:30.640
You are better off
to stay out of it, Dor,

20:30.665 --> 20:32.409
and just let them sort it out.

20:32.488 --> 20:33.976
Well, what about Nash?

20:34.097 --> 20:37.473
You've only got to hang on
for a couple more weeks. Oh!

20:37.635 --> 20:43.102
That's easier said than done, Liz. Hey, hey,
darling, what is the worst she can do to you?

20:43.222 --> 20:48.690
Stick you in the slot, yeah?
How's Bea going?

20:48.810 --> 20:52.548
Yeah, she's good.
She's back in H2, your old cell.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.680
No way!
Yeah, she asked for it.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.494
Why in the bloody hell would she go
and do a stupid thing like that?

20:57.518 --> 20:59.101
I don't know, but I'm glad she did,

20:59.223 --> 21:01.392
cos with you not there,
it gives me someone to talk to.

21:01.514 --> 21:03.402
Ooh, I bet Franky's pissed off,
is she?

21:03.524 --> 21:07.464
Yeah. Now I'm worried
she'll make a move on her.

21:07.584 --> 21:10.638
No, mate, she won't dare. No,
Bea'll be looking out for it now,

21:10.760 --> 21:12.648
and she'll be safe,
as long as she's got Maxine.

21:17.795 --> 21:20.288
Rose, you want a cuppa?
No, thanks.

21:25.112 --> 21:29.333
Hey, we still on
for dinner tomorrow night?

21:29.413 --> 21:34.035
Um, no, I don't think I can.

21:34.116 --> 21:36.849
Oh. OK.

21:36.930 --> 21:38.941
Can I ask why?

21:41.271 --> 21:42.920
Yeah, sorry.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.291
Something's just come up.

22:05.553 --> 22:07.322
I can't do it.

22:09.814 --> 22:13.512
Max, you don't have a choice,
if you want those meds.

22:18.658 --> 22:21.029
What if she asks me to hurt people?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.372
Then you've gotta do it.

22:40.124 --> 22:41.853
Fuckin' breath stinks!

22:50.175 --> 22:52.868
Oi, Maxie, pull up a chair!

22:52.990 --> 22:55.321
You might get lucky!
Can I talk to you?

22:55.401 --> 22:57.652
What? Can I talk to you?

22:57.732 --> 23:01.993
Yeah, come on, take a seat.

23:02.075 --> 23:03.963
It's a tradition in here.

23:04.085 --> 23:06.577
Every girl gets a lap dance
on her birthday, eh?

23:06.658 --> 23:08.828
It's not my birthday.

23:10.356 --> 23:13.894
I can come back later. Hey, no,
I'm busy later. now is good.

23:18.678 --> 23:23.140
The Governor's cut off my meds.
I was hoping you could help me out.

23:24.708 --> 23:26.155
Alright, party's over.

23:26.235 --> 23:30.375
Come on. Party's over, fuck off.

23:30.456 --> 23:32.345
Go!

23:34.999 --> 23:36.808
Ah!

23:36.928 --> 23:40.506
Sorry about that.
Come sit down. Come on.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.917
Thank you.

23:45.612 --> 23:47.059
What do you need?

23:49.391 --> 23:50.838
I wrote it down.

24:00.406 --> 24:02.053
It's gonna cost you.

24:04.948 --> 24:07.520
You prepared to pay the rent?

24:07.600 --> 24:09.692
Yes, how much?

24:09.771 --> 24:11.903
Nothing in coin.

24:12.022 --> 24:14.234
You want this shit
on a regular basis?

24:15.600 --> 24:18.174
Then you're my hench.

24:21.630 --> 24:24.404
I've had a think, Miss Ferguson.

24:24.486 --> 24:26.093
Good.

24:27.379 --> 24:31.721
The thing is, no-one can prove
Nash is the father.

24:31.842 --> 24:33.891
Only one of them DNA tests
can do that.

24:34.013 --> 24:39.399
And even then, you'd have to wait
for the baby to be born.

24:41.329 --> 24:44.666
And Mr Taylor will long be free
by then.

24:55.359 --> 24:57.691
You know, some years ago,

24:57.811 --> 25:02.032
at another correctional facility,
there was a prisoner,

25:02.153 --> 25:07.701
a young woman,
similar in age to you.

25:05.761 --> 25:08.460
She entered the prison
one month pregnant.

25:10.312 --> 25:13.696
Delivered six weeks premature.

25:13.776 --> 25:16.435
It was an emergency labour.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.489
No time for hospital.

25:18.568 --> 25:21.470
It was a complicated birth.

25:23.241 --> 25:24.732
The child almost died.

25:26.303 --> 25:27.913
A boy...

25:29.725 --> 25:32.746
The prisoner was given permission
to keep the baby with her.

25:32.827 --> 25:35.726
Over the next six months, she...

25:35.848 --> 25:37.699
naturally formed
a very close bond with him.

25:46.842 --> 25:49.339
But unfortunately, for the woman,

25:49.461 --> 25:52.400
the Governor saw this child
as a distraction

25:52.482 --> 25:54.817
to the smooth running of his prison.

25:54.938 --> 25:58.119
Protective Services became involved,
and a social worker investigated.

25:58.241 --> 26:01.905
Please, no, no!

26:08.268 --> 26:11.169
He ended up siding
with the Governor,

26:11.249 --> 26:13.586
ordering the removal of the child.

26:18.498 --> 26:22.043
It was very traumatic
for the girl...

26:24.662 --> 26:30.581
To have formed such an intimate bond
with something so precious,

26:30.662 --> 26:33.078
only to have it ripped away.

26:33.199 --> 26:38.435
I blame the social worker myself for
being so easily manipulated, but...

26:40.610 --> 26:44.154
governors, you know, they have
such influence and power.

26:45.765 --> 26:48.705
These tragedies can happen.

27:33.773 --> 27:37.559
I've got a job for you, Maxie.

28:06.235 --> 28:09.902
Come on, let's get this over with.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.640
Come on!

28:46.766 --> 28:49.076
Now, are you sure
there's no dizziness?

28:49.083 --> 28:51.493
Yeah. Or headaches?
No, I'm fine.

28:51.570 --> 28:53.417
OK.

28:53.539 --> 28:56.189
Just a sec, I just want to check
your abdomen, OK?

28:58.555 --> 29:00.684
Is there any pain when I press here?
No.

29:02.651 --> 29:05.380
What about there? No.

29:05.502 --> 29:08.070
Don't s'pose you're going
to tell me who did this?

29:10.397 --> 29:13.570
Ah, do you need any painkillers or
something to help you sleep at all?

29:13.690 --> 29:17.585
No, I'm OK. No? Alright, then, ah,
when Mr Jackson's finished with you,

29:17.704 --> 29:21.637
you can return to your unit.
Thanks. Yeah.

29:26.295 --> 29:28.583
Are we finished?
Go on, then. Get out of here.

29:37.413 --> 29:40.304
It's a waste of time. You know they'd
rather cop a beating than lag.

29:40.423 --> 29:43.434
Well, I'm surprised
she wouldn't talk to you.

29:48.092 --> 29:55.197
Look, Will, it's...
It's not my place to judge, but...

29:57.283 --> 29:59.491
I heard what her
ex-husband said to you.

30:01.297 --> 30:03.386
Is it true?

30:47.781 --> 30:50.512
Have I backed the wrong horse?

30:52.437 --> 30:53.803
No.

31:06.609 --> 31:07.772
Doyle?

31:09.578 --> 31:11.666
She doesn't do her own dirty work.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.196
Then I suggest
she needs some encouragement.

31:14.315 --> 31:16.563
Yeah, I'm working on it.
Work harder.

31:17.647 --> 31:18.810
Wait.

31:22.103 --> 31:24.432
I'm gonna need something
from you first.

31:24.512 --> 31:26.920
Miss Bennett, can I have a word?

31:27.041 --> 31:31.256
Why was I shut out
of the lab test results?

31:31.375 --> 31:34.266
I deemed that information,
"Need to know."

31:34.386 --> 31:39.043
I'm the nurse. If there is a
pregnant prisoner, I do need to know.

31:40.608 --> 31:43.018
Is it Bea Smith?

31:43.097 --> 31:45.626
Smith? Why would you think that?

31:47.232 --> 31:50.282
There's been accusations of an affair
between her and an officer.

31:50.364 --> 31:52.489
And if she was pregnant to a guard

31:52.612 --> 31:54.297
and the other prisoners
found out about it,

31:54.378 --> 31:56.827
it might explain why she was bashed.

32:00.197 --> 32:03.449
It's not Smith, it's Anderson,
and it wasn't an officer,

32:03.528 --> 32:05.456
it was a prisoner from Walford.

32:08.908 --> 32:11.316
You're going to drop it, oh!

32:14.528 --> 32:16.937
Oh, look at you, little Maggie!

32:17.056 --> 32:21.271
You're so cute, eh?

32:21.351 --> 32:23.800
It's very tame, isn't it?

32:23.921 --> 32:27.533
To take a wild thing like that
and nurture it.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.505
You enjoy mothering, don't you?

32:33.354 --> 32:35.803
You know,

32:35.924 --> 32:38.934
I might be in here,
but I still have rights.

32:39.055 --> 32:43.029
And no social worker'll be
taking my baby away from me.

32:44.996 --> 32:47.525
There are other ways to lose a baby,
Doreen.

32:57.157 --> 32:59.045
I've gotta do it.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.531
I've got no choice.

33:00.650 --> 33:02.779
Oh, mate, of course
you've got a choice.

33:02.858 --> 33:04.826
You make a false accusation,

33:04.945 --> 33:08.639
you open yourself up to a whole
world of pain you don't need.

33:08.759 --> 33:10.766
But he's just a screw.
What does it matter?

33:10.887 --> 33:15.221
No, Will Jackson is one of
the few decent screws in here.

33:15.302 --> 33:17.110
Why not say it was Mr Fletcher?

33:17.189 --> 33:18.835
I mean, I could half believe that.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.283
Liz, I wouldn't do it
with any screw.

33:21.365 --> 33:22.808
Of course you wouldn't,

33:22.931 --> 33:25.297
and that's why you've
gotta stick to your guns.

33:28.228 --> 33:30.717
She's gonna take my baby
or worse, she'll kill it.

33:30.836 --> 33:33.005
Come on, come on,
you're being ridiculous.

33:33.126 --> 33:35.854
Darling, she is just trying
to intimidate you, Dor.

33:35.935 --> 33:38.505
Well, it's working!

33:38.584 --> 33:41.515
You have got to be strong.

33:43.562 --> 33:46.652
It's easy for you to say.
You don't even have kids, Liz.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.824
I do.

33:51.390 --> 33:52.514
What?!

33:54.440 --> 33:57.932
I... I've...
I've got two kids, Dor.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.582
OK?

34:00.662 --> 34:02.830
And I stuffed up with both of them.

34:04.998 --> 34:07.247
You never said bloody nothin'!

34:07.365 --> 34:09.130
It's because
there's bloody nothin' to say...

34:09.157 --> 34:11.741
Bullshit! I tell you everything!
Dor, don't...

34:11.862 --> 34:14.230
Liz!
No, I'm not going to do this now.

34:14.351 --> 34:18.764
How can you not...
I can't! Just leave it. Leave it.

34:24.786 --> 34:30.047
I lost my kids
because I made a shitty decision,

34:30.167 --> 34:33.940
and I don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.717
Oh, you gotta be strong, Dor.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.647
Hey? Be strong.

34:51.842 --> 34:56.099
Miss Bennett? I've got a message
for the Governor. Tell her...

34:57.985 --> 35:00.031
Tell her she can make
all the threats she likes,

35:00.153 --> 35:03.002
but I won't be saying Mr Jackson's
the father of my baby

35:03.083 --> 35:04.729
when it's not true.

35:13.640 --> 35:14.924
Will...

35:19.180 --> 35:25.201
Will...
I... I owe you an apology.

35:26.887 --> 35:31.342
I got my wires pretty badly...
Yeah, you did... crossed.

35:31.422 --> 35:32.667
Yeah.

35:34.031 --> 35:36.039
I fucked up.

35:38.368 --> 35:41.016
Anyway, I'm sorry.

35:47.881 --> 35:49.326
Rose?
Mm?

35:51.734 --> 35:55.025
I haven't got around to cancelling
that dinner booking yet.

35:59.602 --> 36:02.854
But Will Jackson.
Why Will Jackson?

36:02.974 --> 36:06.065
I have reason to believe Mr Jackson
was involved in an inappropriate

36:06.184 --> 36:09.357
relationship with the prisoner,
Bea Smith.

36:09.477 --> 36:11.324
I can't prove it
but I believe it to be fact.

36:11.445 --> 36:14.253
My efforts to get Anderson to
implicate Mr Jackson were an attempt

36:14.374 --> 36:16.582
to further mitigate damage
to this prison.

36:16.702 --> 36:19.030
To give me grounds
for his immediate dismissal.

36:19.150 --> 36:21.238
But...
But what?

36:21.360 --> 36:25.654
Sometimes you have to stir up
the waters to catch a fish.

36:27.138 --> 36:29.627
You could have him charged.
What, and put the system through

36:29.748 --> 36:31.516
a very public and protracted
legal battle?

36:31.634 --> 36:34.364
That kind of spectacle would do
no-one within these walls

36:34.445 --> 36:36.011
any favours.

36:36.131 --> 36:39.743
I made an executive decision
to cut out the rot before it spreads.

36:39.863 --> 36:41.711
Do you understand?
Of course, Governor.

36:41.791 --> 36:43.798
What do we do with Anderson?

36:43.879 --> 36:45.323
Slot her.

37:16.874 --> 37:18.519
No!

37:18.602 --> 37:20.168
No!

37:20.247 --> 37:22.776
No!

37:37.602 --> 37:39.540
You look beautiful, by the way.

37:43.091 --> 37:47.126
Are you on? Yep.

38:42.617 --> 38:43.625
Rose?

38:45.682 --> 38:47.337
Rose?

38:54.522 --> 38:56.417
Hello, can you hear me?

38:56.500 --> 38:59.001
No response. Get the gurney.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.548
Look, is she going to be alright?
It's too early to tell, mate.

39:06.668 --> 39:08.484
Can you let her family know
where she's going?

39:09.575 --> 39:11.995
Get that line in.

39:13.812 --> 39:15.950
What's her condition?

39:16.071 --> 39:20.510
Hmm... Yes, her details are on file.
Which hospital?

39:23.093 --> 39:27.571
I'll see that her
family's informed. Keep me updated.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.603
Rose?
Hey.

39:35.683 --> 39:36.856
Hey.

39:40.284 --> 39:42.060
Rose, you're gonna be OK, alright?

39:42.140 --> 39:43.634
Was there an accident?

39:46.297 --> 39:48.074
It wasn't an accident.

39:48.154 --> 39:49.324
Huh?

39:59.896 --> 40:01.834
See you soon, OK? Promise.

40:32.427 --> 40:34.285
What do you want?

40:34.316 --> 40:35.939
Open the fucking door!

40:36.019 --> 40:37.563
I got nothing to say to you.

40:37.681 --> 40:40.056
Oh, we won't be doing much
talking, mate. Open the door!

40:40.174 --> 40:43.737
Open the door, Harry.
Open the door!

40:45.480 --> 40:46.944
I'm calling the cops!

40:48.409 --> 40:50.823
7 Cromwell Ave, Vermont.

40:53.753 --> 40:54.978
Open the door, Harry!

40:55.097 --> 40:57.671
I've got a psychopath trying
to break into my house.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.768
He's got an axe.

40:59.847 --> 41:01.391
You've gotta send someone now!

41:01.470 --> 41:04.874
You leave that van the fuck alone!

41:04.952 --> 41:06.932
I've done nothin' to you!

41:07.052 --> 41:09.546
Except you ran me off
the fucking road!

41:11.644 --> 41:16.116
Fuck! Slashed my tyres!
Trashed my fucking house!

41:16.195 --> 41:18.096
Get off it, you mongrel!

41:24.350 --> 41:26.684
You're gone, mate.

41:43.982 --> 41:46.160
I'm... I'm so sorry, Bea.

41:48.813 --> 41:50.277
How're your hands?

41:53.284 --> 41:54.986
They're... They're fine.

41:55.105 --> 41:57.796
Got something for you.

41:57.876 --> 41:59.500
They're my meds.

42:01.201 --> 42:02.862
These are my hormones.
Yeah, the real deal.

42:02.943 --> 42:04.446
Not that shit
Franky's been giving you.

42:04.471 --> 42:07.930
And when you run out,
I can get you some more.

42:08.050 --> 42:10.819
How?
No need to worry about that.

42:10.938 --> 42:16.242
Just think of it as payment.
Payment for what?

42:18.103 --> 42:21.230
I need you to be my eyes and ears
on Franky's crew.

42:23.802 --> 42:25.268
You planned this?

42:27.008 --> 42:28.552
I needed Franky to trust you.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.255
Attention compound.

42:30.374 --> 42:32.789
Final count will commence
in two minutes.

42:35.123 --> 42:38.844
I need you to hide this for me.
I can't keep it in H2.

42:38.962 --> 42:42.367
I need you to tell me everything
that Franky's planning, right?

42:42.485 --> 42:44.030
I need to know
when she's coming for me.

42:45.574 --> 42:46.840
Gotcha.

42:58.418 --> 43:01.090
There won't be any charges.
I've seen to that.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.468
No need to thank me, Mr Jackson.

43:06.587 --> 43:08.744
Just lucky for you
I have the right friends.

43:08.824 --> 43:10.983
Thank you, Governor.

43:11.101 --> 43:14.712
I don't condone what you did,
but I do understand why you did it.

43:14.830 --> 43:17.344
Let's just hope that Harry Smith
has learned his lesson.

43:17.421 --> 43:18.836
Yeah, well I doubt that.

43:18.952 --> 43:21.583
Well, I'm sure
he won't harass you anymore.

43:23.584 --> 43:27.119
As for running you off the road, just
let the police deal with that, yes?

43:28.454 --> 43:31.555
After all, I don't want to lose
the best officer I have.
