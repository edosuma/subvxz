ADULT ANGELA:
When I was a little girl,

00:22.623 --> 00:25.830
I imagined there was nothing
you were afraid of.

00:27.099 --> 00:30.973
No measure of distance between
us that might cause you concern.

00:31.775 --> 00:35.650
No depth of silence
that might compel you to speak.

00:36.952 --> 00:38.989
You were inaccessible.

00:39.090 --> 00:41.929
You were remote.

00:42.029 --> 00:44.367
You were a fantasy.

00:44.467 --> 00:46.939
ABBEY:
Is your work finished?

00:48.809 --> 00:50.545
ANGELA:
I don't understand it.

00:50.646 --> 00:52.851
You're not trying hard enough.

00:52.951 --> 00:55.055
I am trying.

00:55.155 --> 00:56.992
I'm afraid.

00:57.092 --> 01:00.198
What could you possibly
have to be afraid of?

01:00.298 --> 01:02.871
That Daddy will die.

01:02.971 --> 01:05.442
That both of them will.

01:06.577 --> 01:10.385
That I'm asking
too many questions.

01:10.485 --> 01:13.893
That it will be my fault.

01:17.667 --> 01:21.374
ABBEY:
Get your head
out of your ass, Adams.

01:21.474 --> 01:23.111

JULIAN:
You serve?

01:29.958 --> 01:31.427
Excuse me?

01:31.527 --> 01:33.565
Were you in the military
before Langley?

01:33.666 --> 01:36.604
Yeah.
Why do you ask?

01:38.374 --> 01:40.612
-(traffic passing in distance)
-Just asking.

01:41.547 --> 01:43.786
Where'd you serve?

01:45.288 --> 01:48.194
Fort Huachuca, few years.

01:48.294 --> 01:49.664
Fort Drum before that.

01:49.765 --> 01:52.269
Get out.
I was with the 10th.

01:52.369 --> 01:54.607
Yeah?

01:55.643 --> 01:57.847
Uh, for a bit.
Before JSOC.

01:57.947 --> 01:59.885
Small world.

01:59.985 --> 02:01.621
You were JSOC?

02:03.057 --> 02:04.895
Yeah.

02:04.995 --> 02:07.032
MIKE:
Hey.

02:22.262 --> 02:24.033
What's up?

02:25.335 --> 02:27.172
You remember last summer--

02:27.272 --> 02:29.143
the guy who came to the center.

02:29.243 --> 02:30.545
Leukemia,

02:30.646 --> 02:33.284
maybe he was about 24, 25.

02:33.384 --> 02:35.890
He'd started
a landscaping business.

02:36.892 --> 02:39.463
I remember him
talking about that feeling.

02:40.265 --> 02:42.169
The sun in the morning.

02:42.269 --> 02:44.473
Tending to the world.

02:48.047 --> 02:50.485
I found myself
thinking about that today.

02:53.091 --> 02:55.061
What are you talking about, man?

02:55.863 --> 02:57.599
Something doesn't feel right
out there.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.038
-Shit. What'd you see?
-Nothing.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.576
But maybe it's
the wrong kind of nothing.

03:05.783 --> 03:08.021
(indistinct conversations
on the street)

03:09.123 --> 03:10.960
(phone rings)

03:13.131 --> 03:14.901
This is Waters.

03:17.941 --> 03:19.978
Yeah, he's here.

03:21.614 --> 03:23.986
Well, let's talk about
our expectations

03:24.086 --> 03:26.224
for the next few hours.

03:26.324 --> 03:28.628
Is he talking to Hamzad?

03:28.729 --> 03:31.100
CHASE:
No, he's talking to the men

03:31.200 --> 03:33.104
who are holding Emily.

03:33.204 --> 03:36.845
He's trying to figure out
what exactly they want.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.260
If I knew something
about Faraz Hamzad

03:44.360 --> 03:45.796
that maybe you didn't know,

03:45.897 --> 03:48.368
now would be the time
to tell you, though, right?

03:48.468 --> 03:49.738
Sure, yeah.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.744
So, back on the island,
with his lawyer.

03:52.844 --> 03:55.582
She said she could
get me out of all this.

03:55.683 --> 03:57.619
And I said to her... I asked her

03:57.720 --> 03:59.623
if she could
guarantee that Hamzad

03:59.724 --> 04:01.862
would support
whatever she was offering.

04:01.962 --> 04:04.033
And...

04:04.133 --> 04:06.504
she kind of made a face.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.053
-She made a face?
-Y-You said to watch for

04:14.153 --> 04:17.426
the little things that might
suggest bigger things, and...

04:17.526 --> 04:20.800
and, uh, well,
I-I'm saying that-that...

04:20.900 --> 04:23.238
that she might be indicating
that there's some tension

04:23.338 --> 04:24.674
between her and her client,

04:24.774 --> 04:26.377
and if there's tension,
maybe-maybe

04:26.477 --> 04:28.716
-we could use that.
-I get it, yeah.

04:29.718 --> 04:31.420
Faraz Hamzad is not a guy

04:31.520 --> 04:34.093
who tolerates disloyal people.

04:34.193 --> 04:36.965
Faraz Hamzad's
not a guy who tolerates

04:37.065 --> 04:40.973
the making
of vaguely disloyal faces.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.111
You read it wrong.

04:49.691 --> 04:52.062
That was Morgan Bote's man.

04:52.162 --> 04:54.801
Bote's been wanting
this whole thing to go away

04:54.901 --> 04:56.404
from the moment it started.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.576
Now he's stepping in
to end it himself,

04:59.678 --> 05:03.418
and using Adams-- Emily--

05:03.518 --> 05:06.157
to guarantee that it happens.

05:07.961 --> 05:12.035
Bote told Hamzad to have a plane
ready at an airfield nearby.

05:12.135 --> 05:15.075
If you're on it...

05:15.175 --> 05:17.212
he lets Emily go.

05:17.312 --> 05:19.049
If you're not,

05:19.149 --> 05:22.289
he delivers her
to Hamzad instead.

05:22.389 --> 05:25.095
I don't know what happens then,

05:25.195 --> 05:27.232
but nothing good.

05:29.269 --> 05:30.906
What?

05:31.007 --> 05:34.079
Hamzad has allies
amongst my superiors.

05:34.179 --> 05:36.384
I've been ordered
to see it through.

05:36.484 --> 05:38.756
-I can delay it for a bit,
-Don't...

05:38.856 --> 05:41.093
No, don't delay it.

05:43.231 --> 05:45.670
Bote's man.
Do you know him?

05:45.770 --> 05:47.506
HARPER:
Yeah.

05:47.606 --> 05:49.844
Do you trust him, well,

05:49.944 --> 05:51.682
to keep his side of the bargain?

05:51.782 --> 05:54.788
Is he gonna release her
once they have me?

05:58.561 --> 06:00.598
Yeah.

06:01.634 --> 06:05.241
Mm. Okay, that's it,
that's the ballgame.

06:06.210 --> 06:07.780
(clears throat)

06:13.591 --> 06:17.399
(clears throat)

06:17.499 --> 06:19.403
I don't understand.

06:19.503 --> 06:22.744
Well, everyone's getting
what they want, so it ends.

06:22.844 --> 06:23.846
You're going home now.

06:23.946 --> 06:25.649
I go home when you go home.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.352
No, you're safe now,

06:27.452 --> 06:30.325
there's no reason
for you to stay.

06:30.425 --> 06:32.562
You go back to living your life.

06:32.663 --> 06:34.066
There-there's
nothing else you can do?

06:34.166 --> 06:35.568
How can that be?

06:35.669 --> 06:37.774
Uh, the gun to her head--

06:37.874 --> 06:40.578
that's, uh, that's checkmate.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.652
That's a bluff
I'm not willing to call.

06:43.752 --> 06:45.255
There has to be another way.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.929
-No, there isn't.
-Okay, so, we should be
talking about

06:49.029 --> 06:50.800
how to get you
back out afterwards,

06:50.900 --> 06:53.772
-what the rescue plan
looks like.
-Zoe, Zoe.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.709
-You're gonna have to stop...
-It doesn't matter

06:55.810 --> 06:58.816
what happens to you after this?

06:59.918 --> 07:02.690
I'm sorry, but it does matter

07:02.790 --> 07:04.093
what happens to you after this.

07:04.193 --> 07:06.297
At a bare minimum,
it matters to me

07:06.397 --> 07:08.101
what happens to you after this.

07:08.201 --> 07:10.271
It matters to me
whether you make it out alive.

07:10.371 --> 07:12.309
She's my little girl.

07:15.615 --> 07:17.854
She's my little girl.

07:24.299 --> 07:27.940
I'm sorry
for bringing you into this.

07:30.946 --> 07:34.253
I'm sorry
this has to be the end of it.

07:42.269 --> 07:43.872
That's a face.

07:47.179 --> 07:50.251
Guess I'll never know
what it's indicating, will I?

07:53.759 --> 07:55.228
(grunts softly)

08:12.897 --> 08:15.736
(door opens, closes)

11:32.328 --> 11:33.899
Huh?

14:37.165 --> 14:39.937
YOUNG CHASE:
This is happening
faster than I thought.

14:40.037 --> 14:41.406
I'm gonna need your help.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.477
And you think she's in danger.

14:43.577 --> 14:46.985
I thought she and Hamzad
were inseparable.

14:47.085 --> 14:49.289
They were, until he realized

14:49.389 --> 14:52.095
there were things
he didn't know about her.

14:52.195 --> 14:55.201
It's undoing him, I'm telling
you, I'm watching it happen.

14:56.804 --> 14:58.875
Jesus.

14:58.975 --> 15:02.448
(scoffs)

15:02.549 --> 15:06.189
I have been funneling
guns and cash to this guy

15:06.290 --> 15:07.726
on your say-so,

15:07.826 --> 15:10.498
and now you're saying
he's so off the rails

15:10.598 --> 15:13.637
he might actually
murder his top advisor,

15:13.738 --> 15:16.176
who also
happens to be his wife.

15:17.813 --> 15:19.316
This is...

15:21.620 --> 15:24.994
This is so monumentally
fucked-up.

15:25.094 --> 15:28.434
If I offer you any support

15:28.534 --> 15:31.073
in betraying him,
and then some day

15:31.173 --> 15:32.609
he actually ends up
winning this thing,

15:32.710 --> 15:34.947
we are going to have to
answer for that with him.

15:35.047 --> 15:36.250
He can't win without her.

15:36.350 --> 15:38.989
Well, that's not
going to be good enough.

15:39.089 --> 15:41.326
I need assurances.

15:45.501 --> 15:46.336
Johnny?

15:46.436 --> 15:48.642
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

15:50.544 --> 15:53.450
If I get involved
in crossing him...

15:54.386 --> 15:56.523
...I need to know
that we're never

15:56.623 --> 15:58.594
going to hear from him again.

16:00.464 --> 16:02.368
Help get us out of here.

16:02.468 --> 16:04.539
And I'll take care of the rest.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.678
(hangs up)

16:16.630 --> 16:19.502
JULIAN:
How well do you know
Harold Harper?

16:22.442 --> 16:24.680
(clicks tongue)
How well?

16:24.780 --> 16:27.151
Do you trust
he isn't making a move,

16:27.251 --> 16:28.888
trying to blow this up?

16:32.261 --> 16:34.867
I doubt it.
Last thing he wants

16:34.967 --> 16:38.140
is for things to get messy
with her in the middle.

16:40.177 --> 16:42.983
You know, I thought I knew most
of the guys in private practice

16:43.083 --> 16:45.121
who came from JSOC.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.458
Why have I never heard of you?

16:48.962 --> 16:50.666
We don't work much.

16:50.766 --> 16:53.805
When we do,
it's for one client.

16:56.476 --> 16:59.684
You're a personal covert ops
unit for Morgan Bote.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.325
Whole CIA was a personal covert
ops unit for him at one point.

17:04.426 --> 17:06.664
Trying to tell me
this is any different?

17:08.100 --> 17:09.469
This?

17:09.569 --> 17:11.774
You know who she is?

17:13.745 --> 17:16.851
'Cause you should know her, man.
You'd like her. She's a cop,

17:16.951 --> 17:18.454
yeah, but I-I've never met a cop

17:18.554 --> 17:19.824
that felt more like one of us.

17:19.924 --> 17:21.728
What the fuck are you
trying to say?

17:21.828 --> 17:25.134
Uh, there's things I'm not
supposed to understand, right?

17:25.234 --> 17:27.673
Questions I'm not
supposed to ask.

17:27.773 --> 17:30.578
But you never
got this feeling before?

17:30.679 --> 17:34.185
Like, how on Earth
does this one make sense?

17:34.285 --> 17:36.256
MIKE:
Hey.

17:37.826 --> 17:39.129
-Yeah.
-We okay?

17:39.229 --> 17:41.233
No.
I think it's two groups,

17:41.333 --> 17:42.936
a dozen
to two dozen men, total,

17:43.036 --> 17:45.241
-they're moving in position now.
-You saw that many men outside?

17:45.341 --> 17:47.345
Only saw a few.
But they're out there.

17:47.445 --> 17:49.717
-WATERS: How do you know?
-Because it would take that many
men to cut off the street

17:49.817 --> 17:51.921
from both directions.
Which is what I would do.

17:52.021 --> 17:54.125
Now, we need to move
before they move in on us,

17:54.225 --> 17:57.265
and we need to wake her up
in case we need to move on foot.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.828
♪♪ ♪♪

18:32.401 --> 18:36.076
I assume that was
Zoe McDonald back there.

18:36.176 --> 18:38.614
Yeah.

18:38.715 --> 18:41.954
Did you coerce her
into being here?

18:42.054 --> 18:44.292
Mm, sorta.

18:46.563 --> 18:49.636
Is she gonna be a problem
for me when she leaves?

18:49.737 --> 18:51.841
Problem?
What kind of problem?

18:51.941 --> 18:54.546
Does she know things
that I need to account for?

18:54.647 --> 18:56.984
Oh, does she know
that you're the one

18:57.084 --> 18:59.790
who tried to have me murdered
in her kitchen?

18:59.890 --> 19:02.128
No. I didn't mention it.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.597
Why not?

19:03.698 --> 19:06.737
Water under the bridge, Harold.
I've moved on.

19:08.842 --> 19:11.213
You're in no danger from her.

19:11.313 --> 19:15.421
My hope is that she goes back
to real life once this is done.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.926
Real life.

19:18.928 --> 19:20.564
Yeah.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.738
Uh, I wish her well.

19:26.209 --> 19:28.046
Now let's get on with it.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.956
Azur Maroc Air, flight 31.

19:33.791 --> 19:37.598
Yesterday I was put to a test
by Faraz Hamzad.

19:37.699 --> 19:41.039
A test with no questions.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.043
Only a subject.

19:43.143 --> 19:46.383
Azur Maroc Air, flight 31.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.090
I know that you and your wife

19:50.191 --> 19:52.461
escaped to the U. S. on it.

19:52.562 --> 19:55.634
I pulled that needle
out of a whole stack of needles,

19:55.735 --> 19:57.572
but it wasn't good enough.

19:57.673 --> 19:59.643
There was something else
about that flight

19:59.743 --> 20:03.083
that Faraz Hamzad
wanted to know.

20:03.183 --> 20:05.722
Something I couldn't tell him.

20:06.590 --> 20:09.529
What happened on that flight?

20:11.499 --> 20:12.970
What happened
on the way to that flight

20:13.070 --> 20:15.274
that prevented you
from getting rid of Hamzad

20:15.374 --> 20:16.677
-like I told you to do?
-Oh, Harold.

20:16.777 --> 20:18.815
What-what am I still
not getting here?

20:18.915 --> 20:21.419
-(scoffs) Are you
for real right now?
-Hey,

20:21.519 --> 20:23.023
my career, my whole
professional life

20:23.123 --> 20:25.394
-is over because of this,
and I think I...
-My actual life

20:25.494 --> 20:26.931
is about to be over
because of it.

20:27.031 --> 20:28.500
Pretty sure I win.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.639
Yeah, I understand
there are things

20:30.739 --> 20:32.108
that you would like to know,

20:32.208 --> 20:34.412
battles that we could reenact,

20:34.512 --> 20:36.416
wounds that we could pull apart.
It's just not how

20:36.516 --> 20:40.224
I choose to spend
my last few moments of sunlight.

20:40.324 --> 20:42.562
So, sometimes there are things

20:42.663 --> 20:44.432
that you don't get to know

20:44.532 --> 20:46.603
before the curtain comes down.

20:48.407 --> 20:50.411
Sorry.
You'll live.

20:58.627 --> 21:00.531
I used to spend a day

21:00.631 --> 21:03.303
with each graduating class

21:03.403 --> 21:05.007
at the Academy.

21:05.842 --> 21:07.411
I'd lurk in the background,

21:07.511 --> 21:10.150
looking for the ones
that stood out.

21:10.251 --> 21:11.821
One year,

21:11.921 --> 21:14.092
I'm watching this instructor

21:14.192 --> 21:17.866
really give it to
a young woman in his class.

21:19.168 --> 21:21.506
Kept calling her Freckles.

21:22.308 --> 21:25.982
She was shorter than the others.
I'd barely noticed her all day.

21:26.082 --> 21:28.988
Until I heard this instructor
call her Freckles

21:29.088 --> 21:30.825
one too many times,

21:30.925 --> 21:32.896
and she walked
right up to him,

21:32.996 --> 21:35.367
stared him dead in the eye...
(chuckles)

21:35.467 --> 21:37.338
and knocked him flat on his ass.

21:37.438 --> 21:39.042
(chuckles)

21:40.144 --> 21:44.485
That was the day I took
an interest in Angela Adams.

21:46.857 --> 21:48.661
I've always
treasured that moment,

21:48.761 --> 21:50.597
the same way I did...

21:52.803 --> 21:54.873
...the birth of my son.

21:58.815 --> 22:00.117
But in the last few days,

22:00.217 --> 22:03.090
that moment
has been haunting me.

22:03.190 --> 22:05.461
Raising questions.

22:05.561 --> 22:08.935
Did she share it with you?

22:09.035 --> 22:11.941
Did she share everything
with you?

22:12.041 --> 22:15.314
Was it funny to you
that this fiction of a person

22:15.414 --> 22:16.684
was so important to me?

22:16.784 --> 22:18.988
She didn't.
And it wasn't.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.794
We didn't talk about
that part of her life.

22:22.595 --> 22:25.935
Well, I didn't ask,
and she, um...

22:26.937 --> 22:28.875
We didn't talk about that,
Harold.

22:28.975 --> 22:30.845
Yeah, I bet.

22:30.945 --> 22:32.581
What's that supposed to mean?

22:32.683 --> 22:34.152
Do you think I want to know
what happened

22:34.252 --> 22:38.193
on Azur Maroc Air flight 31
because I'm curious?

22:38.293 --> 22:39.997
Uh, because I'm vindictive?

22:40.097 --> 22:42.168
Because I actually give a shit?

22:42.268 --> 22:45.307
I want to know
because she's gonna ask me.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.078
When this is all said and done,

22:47.178 --> 22:49.917
it may be the only thing
she wants to know in the world.

22:50.017 --> 22:52.288
And she may never rest
until she knows it.

22:52.388 --> 22:53.858
She knows what she needs to know

22:53.958 --> 22:57.465
-about me, she knows enough.
-This is not gonna be about you.

22:57.565 --> 23:00.872
This is gonna be about
your wife.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.110
My wife?

23:03.210 --> 23:05.247
-What are you talking about?
-Your wife.

23:05.347 --> 23:07.753
Abbey Chase, Belour Daadfar,

23:07.853 --> 23:09.389
however else you knew her.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.829
Angela is consumed with
how little she knows about her.

23:12.929 --> 23:14.933
Couldn't stop
poking around in it.

23:15.033 --> 23:17.973
Asking questions.
She kept her own identity

23:18.073 --> 23:20.544
a secret from me
for almost a decade,

23:20.645 --> 23:23.116
and once her mother's
history was raised,

23:23.216 --> 23:25.722
she outed herself
in a matter of days.

23:25.822 --> 23:29.495
You want to control
how she remembers you?

23:29.595 --> 23:30.932
What are the fucking chances
of that?

23:31.032 --> 23:33.303
It's the rememberers
who get to decide

23:33.403 --> 23:36.342
when they're satisfied,
not the remembered.

23:37.144 --> 23:41.119
She's going to ask questions
until she gets some answers.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.590
And when those answers
start turning up

23:43.691 --> 23:45.194
and you're not around

23:45.294 --> 23:47.598
to defend yourself...

23:47.699 --> 23:51.306
I could help her,
but not if I don't know

23:51.406 --> 23:53.610
any more than she does.

23:54.813 --> 23:57.051
Well played, Harold.

23:57.151 --> 23:59.823
I'm not fucking around here,
Johnny.

23:59.923 --> 24:02.662
I don't like seeing her hurt.

24:03.530 --> 24:05.969
And I don't think you do either.

24:07.605 --> 24:12.214
You have a chance here
to spare her a whole lifetime

24:12.314 --> 24:15.220
of despair and confusion.

24:16.256 --> 24:18.260
Tell me how to help her.

24:29.883 --> 24:31.319
(Chase clears throat softly)

24:32.388 --> 24:35.027
I... I never, uh...

24:37.431 --> 24:39.068
What?

24:43.610 --> 24:45.982
Pavlovich, you know, he...

24:46.784 --> 24:48.320
he said something today.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.827
Told me some things about Abbey
that I didn't know.

24:52.762 --> 24:56.002
Told me that she recruited him.

24:57.772 --> 25:00.678
She cultivated him
years in advance,

25:00.778 --> 25:02.649
until she was ready
to activate him

25:02.749 --> 25:05.254
to help her husband
win his war.

25:06.556 --> 25:08.093
How many people we ever know

25:08.193 --> 25:10.765
that could play the game
that way?

25:10.865 --> 25:12.869
Did we know any?

25:15.607 --> 25:18.714
When I called you

25:18.814 --> 25:21.787
to help us escape, I...

25:21.887 --> 25:24.091
I knew exactly
what I was doing.

25:24.192 --> 25:27.097
I was protecting
the bravest and most noble woman

25:27.198 --> 25:30.604
I'd ever met.
Never doubted it.

25:30.705 --> 25:32.909
Not then.
Not since.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.216
But suddenly,

25:36.316 --> 25:38.988
I'm hearing questions.

25:39.088 --> 25:41.861
Is it possible that...

25:41.961 --> 25:43.263
you know, she was using me too?

25:43.363 --> 25:45.869
Is it possible that
she was cultivating me

25:45.969 --> 25:48.440
for an exit strategy?

25:49.977 --> 25:52.749
That's a hell of a thing,
isn't it?

25:53.718 --> 25:56.623
You can live a whole life

25:56.724 --> 25:58.426
certain of so many things

25:58.526 --> 26:00.732
and then, in a moment...

26:00.832 --> 26:03.069
it's all up for grabs.

26:06.442 --> 26:08.280
No.

26:08.380 --> 26:11.787
If you need to tell her
something about her mother,

26:11.887 --> 26:14.425
you tell her that
her mother loved her.

26:14.525 --> 26:18.834
That everything she did--
everything we did-- was for her.

26:22.041 --> 26:25.347
Well, that may be
all I know for certain.

26:31.225 --> 26:32.662
(phone vibrates)

26:32.762 --> 26:34.332
(Chase grunts softly)

26:38.240 --> 26:40.244
Waters?

26:42.481 --> 26:44.853
I don't know
what you're talking abou...

26:45.888 --> 26:47.926
Someone's making
a move against you?

26:48.026 --> 26:51.566
Ray, tell me where you are
so we can come and...

26:51.667 --> 26:53.270
Drop a pin.

26:53.370 --> 26:54.572
Ray, drop a...

26:54.673 --> 26:56.175
-Oh, fuck.
-What's happening?

26:56.977 --> 26:58.748
He says he thinks
they're surrounded.

26:58.848 --> 27:00.752
-Surrounded? By who?
-I don't know

27:00.852 --> 27:02.488
any more than that.

27:05.795 --> 27:07.097
Does Hamzad know
that my daughter's

27:07.197 --> 27:09.468
-part of this transaction?
-What?

27:09.568 --> 27:11.472
-Does Hamzad know
that my daughter is part
-It's possible.

27:11.572 --> 27:13.576
-of this transaction?
-I don't know. Why?

27:13.678 --> 27:14.947
It's Hamzad.

27:15.047 --> 27:17.919
He's gonna
try to grab her himself.

27:29.876 --> 27:31.647
It's Harper.
Hamzad's reneged,

27:31.747 --> 27:34.018
the deal's off.
Follow me.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.644
Is your work finished?

28:03.744 --> 28:05.982
I'm trying.

28:07.919 --> 28:10.157
(child laughing)

28:30.564 --> 28:32.601
(water dripping)

28:58.153 --> 29:00.892
You have come so far.

29:00.992 --> 29:03.229
To find you.

29:04.065 --> 29:05.768
To save you.

29:05.868 --> 29:07.438
Stop that.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.508
Talking that way.

29:09.608 --> 29:11.446
You're your father.

29:12.514 --> 29:14.118
It isn't him.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.622
It's me.

29:18.026 --> 29:20.163
Why can't you see that?

29:21.733 --> 29:24.071
You don't belong here, Freckles.

29:24.171 --> 29:25.975
You never did.

29:26.075 --> 29:28.446
Don't call me that.

29:28.546 --> 29:31.252
What would you
like me to call you?

29:38.366 --> 29:40.604
(woman crying in distance)

30:08.794 --> 30:11.032
(woman wailing)

30:19.548 --> 30:21.586

30:34.512 --> 30:37.484
WATERS (muffled, echoing):
Open your eyes. Angela! Hey.

30:37.584 --> 30:39.288
Open your eyes.

30:39.388 --> 30:41.392
(clearly): Open your eyes.

30:42.194 --> 30:45.500
Take a second.
I want you to sit up slowly.

30:46.904 --> 30:48.173
You got it, come on.

30:48.273 --> 30:49.608
-(gasps)
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

30:49.709 --> 30:52.047
It's okay. It's okay.
This isn't about you.

30:52.147 --> 30:53.884
No one wants to see you
get hurt, all right?

30:53.984 --> 30:56.222
Look at me.
Come on, sit up.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.661
Come on.
I'm here.

30:58.761 --> 31:00.263
I'm gonna make sure
you get home okay.

31:00.363 --> 31:03.403
All right?
You trust me?

31:05.842 --> 31:07.411
All right, look.

31:07.511 --> 31:10.317
Take this.
Sip it slowly.

31:10.417 --> 31:13.089
Just breathe.
Okay?

31:13.891 --> 31:16.697
Hey. We're sure
this is a good idea, yeah?

31:16.797 --> 31:19.936
We open that garage door,
the sniper across the way

31:20.036 --> 31:22.441
is gonna shoot whichever
one of us is driving that van.

31:22.541 --> 31:26.148
None of us wants to be in an
exposed van with a dead driver.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.455
WATERS:
The sniper none of us
have actually seen, right?

31:29.555 --> 31:31.693
-He's there.
-How do you know?

31:31.793 --> 31:34.465
-Because that's what I would do.
-That's what you would do, no,
I get it, I get it.

JULIAN:
Once I get the overwatch
shooter down,

31:36.970 --> 31:38.573
I'll signal, you just run.

31:38.674 --> 31:41.078
We'll meet up on the main road,

are you talking about?

36:40.043 --> 36:42.113
Why would I do anything
to make her less safe?

36:42.214 --> 36:44.117
I don't know, but you are.

36:44.218 --> 36:46.155
It's what you've been doing
all this time.

36:46.255 --> 36:48.727
I gave you the chance
to walk away from this

36:48.827 --> 36:53.169
and leave her out of it
entirely, and you didn't do it.

36:53.269 --> 36:54.939
I told you-- I told you--

36:55.039 --> 36:57.577
not to leave Hamzad alive,
that it would

36:57.678 --> 37:00.016
come back and haunt you,
and you did it anyway.

37:00.116 --> 37:02.688
It's like you're trying to make
this as dangerous as possible.

37:02.788 --> 37:06.195
-Don't profile me, Harold.
-Then don't be so fucking
easy to profile!

37:06.295 --> 37:08.466
She's not your kid!

37:09.268 --> 37:12.407
You're fond of her, you
took care of her-- thank you--

37:12.507 --> 37:14.879
but I'm her father, I'm gonna
decide how we handle this.

37:14.979 --> 37:17.885
She's not my kid?
All those years

37:17.985 --> 37:20.724
you two were avoiding
uncomfortable conversations,

37:20.824 --> 37:22.594
I was the one
who was there for her

37:22.695 --> 37:24.131
when there were
uncomfortable conversations

37:24.231 --> 37:26.770
that needed to be had.
I've cried with her

37:26.870 --> 37:28.874
and struggled with her
and-and fought with her

37:28.974 --> 37:30.844
-and lost sleep, and just...
-Harold.

37:30.945 --> 37:32.247
What?

37:32.347 --> 37:35.119
-(walkie beeps)
-Assistant Director Harper.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.792
What?

37:38.593 --> 37:40.430
Please pull over.

37:40.530 --> 37:42.233
Why?

37:42.334 --> 37:45.874
My superiors have ordered me
to turn back for the airfield.

37:45.975 --> 37:48.145
Turn ba...
What do you mean, turn back?

37:48.246 --> 37:51.385
Tell your superiors
an FBI agent's life is at stake.

37:51.485 --> 37:53.389
I told them.
But the order

37:53.489 --> 37:55.193
was restated and it was clear.

37:55.293 --> 37:57.932
If you will not comply,
I am to force compliance.

37:58.032 --> 38:00.871
If you resist,
I am to arrest you.

38:00.971 --> 38:03.944
I fear there are conversations
happening far above me.

38:04.044 --> 38:06.248
I'm sorry.
I tried.

38:06.348 --> 38:07.852

38:07.952 --> 38:09.722
Oh, fuck that.

38:09.822 --> 38:11.960
-(briefcase latch snaps)
-They made me take this

38:12.060 --> 38:14.064
when I wouldn't
let them handcuff you.

38:14.164 --> 38:15.934
Joke's on them, I guess.

38:16.736 --> 38:18.840
How far are you
prepared to go here?

38:18.941 --> 38:21.011
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

38:21.111 --> 38:22.614
I need to know.

38:22.715 --> 38:25.286
I hired an assassin
to kill you,

38:25.386 --> 38:29.027
I consented to get myself
kidnapped by an Afghan warlord,

38:29.127 --> 38:32.033
I'm stealing a car from
the Moroccan secret police--

38:32.133 --> 38:35.073
what exactly are you afraid
that I won't do now?

38:35.173 --> 38:37.712
None-none of that matters,
this is different now.

38:37.812 --> 38:40.283
Oh, it's different, all right.

38:40.383 --> 38:42.888
Her life's at stake.

38:42.989 --> 38:44.792
She's my kid too.

38:44.892 --> 38:48.432
Like it. Don't.
I don't care.

38:48.532 --> 38:49.836
But you're not the only one

38:49.936 --> 38:52.173
who's scared to death
for her right now.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.781
