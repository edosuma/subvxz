03:33.279 --> 03:34.803
Maya?

03:42.789 --> 03:44.450
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.792
- Did you finish your reading?
- Yeah.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.190
Most of it.

03:56.469 --> 03:59.666
You know how everyone's complaining
about how dangerous the city is...

03:59.872 --> 04:03.569
...and how they wish they could go back
to the good old days when it wasn't?

04:03.776 --> 04:08.076
Well, it turns out there never
really were any good old days.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.007
It's always been
a hell hole.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.724
You don't find me fascinating anymore?

04:22.128 --> 04:23.390
What?

04:24.631 --> 04:26.599
- Babe, are you all right?
- No.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.460
- No?
- No.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.796
Some Russian cabbie
jumped a curb today...

04:32.005 --> 04:33.563
- Yeah.
- And knocked a pedestrian...

04:33.773 --> 04:35.968
...through a storefront window.
I got there just as they were...

04:36.175 --> 04:39.770
...loading the body in the bag,
and I thought I got the shot...

04:41.180 --> 04:43.705
...something that the <i>Post</i>
would buy, you know, but...

04:43.916 --> 04:47.181
- I don't think it's good enough.
- What if I had some good news for you.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.720
You know, like news that meant
you could throw away your police radio...

04:50.923 --> 04:54.654
...and only shoot the stuff you want.
Forever and ever.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.854
I'd marry you.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.190
That's it?

04:59.499 --> 05:01.194
What else do you want?

05:02.068 --> 05:03.763
Well...

05:05.071 --> 05:07.130
...how about...

05:07.340 --> 05:11.208
...you in a bed...

05:12.111 --> 05:13.669
...not worrying about anything...

05:14.480 --> 05:18.940
...for at least an hour,
except how to make me and yourself...

05:19.619 --> 05:21.211
...really, really happy.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.752
- It's a deal.
- Yeah?

05:22.955 --> 05:24.479
- Yeah.
- You like that?

05:24.691 --> 05:27.683
You like that? That's good. So...

05:29.696 --> 05:32.290
You know how you're wishing
Jurgis would introduce you...

05:32.498 --> 05:34.398
...to some of his fancy
art-world friends?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.625
And you can never understand
why he doesn't?

05:37.737 --> 05:39.534
Well, I called him today and I said:

05:39.839 --> 05:41.534
"How come you don't introduce Leon...

05:41.741 --> 05:44.403
...to any of your fancy friends?"
Do you know what he said?

05:44.610 --> 05:46.669
- What?
- That he didn't do it...

05:46.879 --> 05:50.713
...because he figured that
when you were ready, you would ask.

05:54.654 --> 05:55.746
So I asked for you.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.715
Isn't that great?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.919
Do you know who Susan Hoff is?

06:04.130 --> 06:06.428
Of course. You're kidding.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.994
Do I look like I'm kidding you?

06:09.502 --> 06:11.834
- You're meeting her tomorrow.
- Are you kidding me?

06:12.038 --> 06:13.300
No.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.408
Does my hour start now?

06:34.694 --> 06:37.788
Whatever you do, don't mention Maya.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.362
What? Why?

06:39.565 --> 06:43.296
Susan likes her artists
young, male and single.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.265
Actually, you know what?

06:47.006 --> 06:49.304
The male part isn't that important.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.513
Here we go. Come on.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.873
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.815
- Sorry that we're late.
- Oh, don't apologize.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.924
Punctuality means nothing to me.
It's a virtue for the mediocre.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.295
You know when I first knew
that Basquiat was a genius?

07:10.496 --> 07:13.124
When he was three days late for lunch.

07:13.332 --> 07:15.266
So tell me about your work.

07:17.904 --> 07:20.464
Explain it to me. What interests you?

07:21.641 --> 07:23.973
- The city.
- Why?

07:24.177 --> 07:27.840
Because no one's ever captured it.
Not the way it really is...

07:28.047 --> 07:32.507
...the heart of it.
That's my goal, that's my dream.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.178
Then you're failing.

07:45.097 --> 07:47.588
You were at the right place,
weren't you?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.699
- Yeah.
- But not the right time.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.902
The image grabs our attention,
sure, but so what?

07:55.107 --> 07:57.701
It's melodrama, arresting but empty.

07:58.544 --> 08:02.742
I want to know what comes next. I want
to see the face of the businessman...

08:02.949 --> 08:04.439
...when the filth touches him.

08:05.184 --> 08:08.278
The next time you find yourself
at the heart of the city...

08:08.488 --> 08:13.289
...stay put, be brave, keep shooting.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.393
Then come see me.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.601
- She hates my work.
- No, she doesn't.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.936
When she hates somebody's work,
she gives them about a minute.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.476
- You got three.
- So, what? She likes it?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.945
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.386
You think she's right, don't you?

08:53.866 --> 08:55.629
She's not.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.402
Oh, no, no, no.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.073
Time to pay the toll, baby.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.037
Leave me alone, please.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.309
Yeah.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.545
- You gotta pay on your knees, baby.
- Hey!

11:36.996 --> 11:39.294
What the fuck you gonna do, bitch?

11:40.766 --> 11:42.700
Why don't you come
up here and find out.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.301
What?

11:45.438 --> 11:46.803
That's good.

11:47.606 --> 11:48.595
Yeah, that's great.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.708
All right, stop right there.
Right there. Stop. That's perfect.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.410
Ever starred in a movie before?

12:19.672 --> 12:21.299
Yo. Let's go.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.819
Dead motherfucker.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.657
You okay?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.124
Thanks.

12:45.297 --> 12:48.892
Most people would have ran away.

12:49.969 --> 12:53.132
Oh, yeah.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.465
I didn't this time.

12:54.673 --> 12:56.334
Yeah.

13:19.431 --> 13:20.864
Thanks.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.298
- Hey, babe?
- Yeah.

14:30.502 --> 14:31.696
You seen my purse?

14:32.137 --> 14:34.503
- Yeah, it's on the chair.
- Okay.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.978
When did you take these?

14:41.814 --> 14:43.441
Last night.

14:44.950 --> 14:49.250
You have to show these to Susan Hoff.
What you said she wants...

14:49.655 --> 14:51.520
...I mean, this is it.

14:51.790 --> 14:52.779
Yeah, you think so?

14:52.992 --> 14:56.621
Yeah, because if it's not,
I hope I never see it.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.854
Hey. Good morning.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.554
Morning.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.459
Babe, I'll see you later.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.428
All right.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.707
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks, babe.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.978
Hands off.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.850
- No fucking way.
- Come on, one last time.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.248
I said never again.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.583
If I don't care that your disgusting
grease gets all over my tofu...

15:26.792 --> 15:29.420
...why do you care that tofu
would get over your grease?

15:29.695 --> 15:32.687
Because my customers, real Americans
with blood in their veins...

15:32.898 --> 15:35.958
...they don't want their cheese steak
within a mile of a bean curd.

15:36.168 --> 15:38.466
- It makes me wanna puke.
- They're never gonna know.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.229
- I'll know.
- Tofu's tasteless.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.736
- Now you admit it.
- Of course.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.098
My gramps, God rest his soul...

15:44.310 --> 15:47.507
Jesus. If he saw me do this,
he'd rise and make a sausage out of me.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.739
Yeah, and your regular customers
would gobble it right up.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.267
Maya.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.872
That's the same girl, right?

16:15.774 --> 16:17.264
She's a model.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.104
"Erika Sakaki disappeared
after leaving a downtown club...

16:20.312 --> 16:21.870
...shortly after 2 a.m."

16:22.081 --> 16:23.742
Oh, my God.

16:24.283 --> 16:26.342
- What?
- That's right when I shot her.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.547
I gotta go.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.314
- Where are you going?
- Cops. I'll call you later.

16:37.629 --> 16:40.826
And they ran off after you made
your presence known.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.797
No, you see them? No, no.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.563
It wasn't until I pointed out
the surveillance camera.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.569
That's what made them leave.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.670
- Where did they go?
- I thought that they left...

16:52.878 --> 16:55.346
...but it's quite possible,
and that's why I'm here...

16:55.547 --> 16:58.175
...to say that perhaps they went
down another stairwell...

16:58.384 --> 17:00.579
...and entered the same train
that she went on.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.485
And you?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.713
I told you. I...

17:04.923 --> 17:07.255
I did not get on the train.
I left on foot.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.861
- Okay.
- Okay?

17:12.964 --> 17:14.898
Well, I'm sure anything
you need to know...

17:15.099 --> 17:17.193
...will be on that surveillance tape.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.200
Do you sell your photos?

17:19.405 --> 17:24.536
What? Yes, but not like this.
Police calls mostly.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.574
Erika's a pretty big model.

17:27.945 --> 17:29.413
Tabloids be interested in these.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.049
Really? I wouldn't know.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.282
- Is that so?
- Yeah. I wasn't stalking her...

17:35.487 --> 17:37.182
...if that's what you're indicating.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.756
Look, I... I saw these guys.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.587
I thought that they looked
suspicious, so I followed them.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.889
But you did continue
to photograph her?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.301
Well, yeah, yeah, but...
I guess so, but...

17:51.870 --> 17:53.428
Why?

18:00.446 --> 18:03.279
When you come up
with an answer, call me.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.706
What?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.545
It's nothing.
I didn't imagine you to be...

18:34.746 --> 18:37.647
...the person that would say, "whoa."
- I'm not.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.283
I don't.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.220
I haven't said it since high school.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.290
But that's how good it is.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.596
I'm having a group show
in three weeks.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.699
Get me two more images that strong...

19:01.740 --> 19:03.708
...and you'll be a part of it.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.083
Okay.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.611
Oh, good.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.791
Without your unconditional
love and support...

19:21.426 --> 19:25.055
...and without you finally introducing
me to one of your contacts...

19:25.264 --> 19:27.528
I can't believe you made me wait
so long.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.092
- none of this
would have been possible.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.995
I love you both.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.536
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.811
- Now, I must depart.
- What? No.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.487
- What? Where are you...? What?
- Two more images.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.588
That's not tonight. No.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.013
Why can't...?

19:53.225 --> 19:56.388
- Two more shots. That's all I need.
- What about these shots?

20:15.013 --> 20:17.538
Hey, tell your wife to relax.

20:18.951 --> 20:22.284
Sweetie, I take the train every day.
Safer than walking.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.478
But you hear these stories.

20:24.690 --> 20:28.626
That was ages ago. Look, no graffiti,
air conditioning works.

20:28.827 --> 20:31.387
You can understand the conductor.
It's a new century.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.294
We're getting at off the next stop,
so you can do what you want...

20:37.502 --> 20:39.663
...but we're getting off, okay.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.635
All right, fine. You know what?
We can go back to my place...

20:42.841 --> 20:44.775
...and Leigh here can cook us...

20:44.977 --> 20:48.208
...a nice romantic dinner for three.
- Did we just miss our stop?

20:49.181 --> 20:51.649
- You'd have to talk my wife into bed.
- You're into it.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.408
- Randle.
- Wait a second, honey.

20:53.619 --> 20:56.087
You know, it's cheap wine.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.580
Cheaper than the plate.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.848
- Maybe if you didn't sleep...
- Randle.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.252
- What?
- What trips me out...

21:01.460 --> 21:02.825
Randle!

21:09.868 --> 21:11.267
Randle!

21:29.721 --> 21:31.052
No!

21:39.298 --> 21:41.493
Why are you doing this?

22:21.707 --> 22:23.299
No!

24:47.085 --> 24:48.450
I'm sorry, mister, I...

24:48.653 --> 24:50.450
I just wanted a picture of you.

24:51.256 --> 24:53.520
Sometimes I don't know
what I'm thinking.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.010
- Hey, buddy?
- What?

30:24.222 --> 30:25.712
Mind if I take a look?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.322
- Officer, you can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

30:28.526 --> 30:31.324
Orange Alert and above,
I can search whatever I want.

30:31.529 --> 30:33.258
How do I know
you don't got explosives?

30:33.464 --> 30:35.022
It's a camera.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.773
Yeah. Life's like a box of chocolates.

31:36.694 --> 31:39.094
What the hell is going on?

31:39.297 --> 31:41.458
Supposed to be a local.

32:21.706 --> 32:23.970
This is a citizen's arrest.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.409
Damn.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.059
Damn!

32:51.035 --> 32:52.832
I'm gonna shove
that hammer up your ass!

33:04.649 --> 33:06.674
I'm very disappointed in you, Mahogany.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.081
Clean up the mess.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.154
Jeez.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.820
God.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.697
- How'd you get in here?
- The spare key.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.005
Okay, before you freak out...

34:04.976 --> 34:07.206
...let me just say it's not
an engagement ring...

34:07.412 --> 34:09.972
...until I make enough money, but it's...

34:10.181 --> 34:13.206
It says that we're engaged
to be engaged.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.010
It's not bad, hey?

34:15.219 --> 34:16.914
No.

34:20.658 --> 34:23.627
- I have horrible taste.
- No, you don't.

34:24.094 --> 34:26.393
- It's beautiful.
- You think so?

34:37.675 --> 34:39.266
It should fit.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.244
I can't imagine my life without you.

34:50.321 --> 34:52.118
Don't even try.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.855
I love you.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.470
Baby.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.605
No!

38:15.092 --> 38:16.787
Who's this guy?

38:17.261 --> 38:20.788
Oh. I don't know. A butcher.

38:21.899 --> 38:24.493
He was at the station the night
that model disappeared.

38:24.702 --> 38:26.260
Are they for your show?

38:26.470 --> 38:30.236
- No, there's just something about him.
- Yeah, I'd say.

38:30.441 --> 38:33.171
But why are you following him?

38:33.377 --> 38:36.107
It seems like you should be
working on your stuff for Susan.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.283
No, no, I know,
but if that model's still missing...

38:39.483 --> 38:42.975
...and he was at the station...
- Yeah, so just, you know...

38:43.754 --> 38:47.155
...give a picture
to the cops and move on.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.292
I mean, people disappear all the time.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.552
Whatever happened, they'll figure it out.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.307
- What?
- What?

43:37.815 --> 43:39.339
What's wrong?

43:39.617 --> 43:41.778
How can I put this delicately?

43:42.753 --> 43:43.981
You look like shit.

43:44.188 --> 43:45.746
Give me a break.
I'm working my ass off.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.947
Doing what? Contracting TB?

43:48.158 --> 43:51.127
Hey, Otto, take a look
at the dying man over here.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.159
What the fuck happened to you?

43:54.031 --> 43:55.123
What are your specials?

43:56.600 --> 44:00.001
We have brisket on rye,
turkey meatloaf on rye...

44:00.537 --> 44:03.097
...chicken parmigiana on r...

44:08.545 --> 44:12.003
What? What's the big deal?
It's one bite.

44:15.719 --> 44:17.812
Fuck it. Give me one of these.

44:18.889 --> 44:23.326
You sure about that? It's a steak. Meat.

44:23.527 --> 44:25.017
Absolutely.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.478
Hey.

44:57.161 --> 44:59.288
I know I look like shit.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.391
More of the butcher?

45:05.803 --> 45:07.532
That's where he works.

45:10.774 --> 45:14.210
Babe, listen to me.
I don't care if you eat meat.

45:14.411 --> 45:19.542
I eat it all the time.
But this thing with this butcher...

45:19.750 --> 45:21.547
Shouldn't you be focusing
on your work?

45:21.752 --> 45:24.118
Oh, God, remember what you told me?

45:24.321 --> 45:28.155
About how people are always missing
for all sorts of reasons, right?

45:28.358 --> 45:29.347
- Right?
- Yeah.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.495
Usually, there's a reason.
I've been thinking about that lately.

45:32.696 --> 45:36.097
Look at this. These pins represent
missing people for the last 3 years.

45:36.300 --> 45:39.497
Not one of them has ever turned up.
No letter home. No call for money.

45:39.703 --> 45:42.467
Not even a corpse. Nothing.
They just vanished into thin air.

45:42.673 --> 45:47.303
- Okay, so what do you think happened?
- Well, it's not chance.

45:48.479 --> 45:50.310
Somebody's abducting them.

45:52.015 --> 45:55.041
And they never find the bodies
because he takes them here.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.776
- He butchers them?
- Yeah.

45:56.987 --> 46:00.047
- Baby... Listen to me. I'm sure...
- Look at this. Look what I found.

46:00.257 --> 46:01.781
This is...

46:05.596 --> 46:07.154
So some guy
was accused of kidnap...

46:07.364 --> 46:09.332
- A guy who worked...
- This is a century ago.

46:09.533 --> 46:11.160
A guy who worked in the same plant.

46:11.368 --> 46:14.030
What are you saying?
You saying that it's the same person?

46:14.238 --> 46:17.071
Is that what you're saying?
I don't understand how that works.

46:17.274 --> 46:19.469
How does that work? How...?
Was he reincarnated?

46:19.676 --> 46:21.837
No, no. I don't know. Maybe, but look...

46:22.045 --> 46:25.344
...the point is that it's happened before.
It can't be a coincidence.

46:25.549 --> 46:29.349
No, this guy's involved somehow.
I know it. Look at this. Look at this.

46:29.553 --> 46:31.487
I was there the night that it happened.

46:31.688 --> 46:33.986
She got abducted.
This is the train she went in on.

46:34.191 --> 46:37.217
That's his hand. You know how I know?
I took another photograph...

46:37.427 --> 46:41.227
...of him going down into the subway,
the same subway. I totally got him.

46:41.431 --> 46:44.594
This is the guy, Maya. It's been
happening. There's been abductions.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.669
It's happened. I don't know
if it's a copycat, but I got him.

46:47.871 --> 46:49.964
This is not what's going on, okay?

46:50.174 --> 46:53.075
This is all fake, okay? It's not.

46:53.277 --> 46:55.973
No more. No more night shoots.

46:56.180 --> 46:58.546
No more, please. Just day shoots.

46:58.749 --> 47:00.717
I don't want you to shoot terrible things.

47:00.918 --> 47:03.011
I want you to stop
with the conspiracy theory.

47:03.220 --> 47:05.120
I want you to stop with the butcher.

47:05.322 --> 47:08.120
I just want you to shoot
the stuff that makes you happy.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.885
What makes you happy?
What do you love?

47:13.030 --> 47:14.019
Please.

47:14.998 --> 47:16.693
Don't leave me.

47:18.202 --> 47:20.170
You, I love you.

47:21.572 --> 47:23.005
I love you.

48:04.848 --> 48:06.179
I got it.

48:13.957 --> 48:15.447
That's good.

48:30.807 --> 48:32.672
I'm sorry.

48:33.577 --> 48:34.942
Why?

48:35.579 --> 48:37.206
I'm sorry.

48:58.535 --> 49:00.526
Jurgis showed me a picture
of that broad...

49:00.737 --> 49:03.228
...that's gonna make your boy
rich and famous.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.499
Yeah? So?

49:08.345 --> 49:11.678
What do you have to do to get a date
with a broad like that, huh?

49:12.049 --> 49:16.179
Magically transform into someone
who does not call women "broads."

49:22.025 --> 49:24.755
Maya. Can I talk to you for a second?

49:24.962 --> 49:26.896
No fucking way.

49:27.097 --> 49:30.362
No. Come back later. She's busy.
Come back later.

49:33.203 --> 49:34.636
You okay?

49:35.372 --> 49:36.896
You were right.

49:40.744 --> 49:42.302
That's all I wanted to say.

51:29.719 --> 51:32.119
Candy. You want to buy some candy?

51:32.322 --> 51:33.721
Sorry, man.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.528
Whatever, man.

51:49.272 --> 51:51.172
You want to buy some candy, mister?

51:56.980 --> 51:59.778
- Go to somebody else.
- Come on, man, buy some candy.

52:36.253 --> 52:37.982
Was that a game or what?

55:59.322 --> 56:01.017
Oh, shit.

56:21.144 --> 56:22.736
Hey! Open up!

56:22.946 --> 56:24.777
Open the fucking door!

56:25.181 --> 56:27.274
Open the fucking door!

58:42.252 --> 58:43.241
My God.

58:49.292 --> 58:50.782
- Who is it?
- It's me.

58:52.395 --> 58:54.363
Oh, thank God, baby.

58:54.564 --> 58:56.156
Where have you been?

58:57.333 --> 58:59.528
Leon, what's the matter? Leon.

58:59.736 --> 59:02.830
Leon, what's going on?
Leon, what's the matter?

59:05.208 --> 59:06.573
Leon?

59:07.644 --> 59:10.511
Babe, come on, open up.
What's going on?

59:14.484 --> 59:16.543
Leon, open the door.

59:18.688 --> 59:20.622
Leon, you're scaring me.

59:24.093 --> 59:25.720
Please open the door.

59:29.365 --> 59:31.390
This is not fair, Leon.

59:34.103 --> 59:35.866
Open the door.

59:38.041 --> 59:40.066
Open this fucking door now!

59:40.276 --> 59:43.370
You know you can't do this.
This is not fucking fair.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.515
You cannot just be out, gone all night,
and just disappear...

59:46.716 --> 59:49.207
...and then fucking lock the door
in my face.

59:54.524 --> 59:56.685
- I need to sleep.
- No, no, no, baby, baby, baby.

59:56.893 --> 01:00:00.727
Babe, babe, babe, what happened?
What happened?

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.756
Oh, God. What is this?

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:05.992
Honey.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.700
We have to get you
to a hospital right now.

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.803
I followed him into the subway.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.308
Wha...?

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.645
It's always the late train.

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:24.081
Probably the same one each time.
He waits for it to empty out...

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.717
...and then he kills them.

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:30.292
He butchers them like cattle.

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.752
I saw it.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.726
I took pictures.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:42.401
They never find the remains because
he unloads the meat somewhere.

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:48.107
We have to...
I have to call an ambulance.

01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:51.743
There's an abandoned
subway station...

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:54.041
...underneath the meat plant.
- Okay.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:57.886
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna take you to the hospital...

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.146
...and when the doctors
are working on you...

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.847
...I'm gonna take your pictures,
take them to the cops.

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:06.323
They won't listen. My camera's gone.

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.497
- What?
- He took it from me.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:12.361
- That's the only proof I have.
- Baby, it's gonna be okay.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:16.334
I'm gonna call an ambulance, okay?
I'm gonna fix it.

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.874
- It's okay.
- No.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:32.382
They'll think I'm a lunatic.
They'll think that I killed Erika.

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.021
I know. I want to help you.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:36.657
Help me. I want to help you.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.292
No.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.829
Sleep.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.857
My opening's tonight.

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.314
- We're as crazy as he is.
- No, we're not.

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:08.012
Because we know what
we're doing is insane.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.025
He doesn't.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.696
What else are we gonna do?
Jurgis, what else?

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.865
We need his camera.
We need to see what he saw.

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:27.702
Jesus Christ.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.336
No, no, no.

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:34.374
I want you to wait here.
If he comes back...

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:37.838
...just make a sound, okay? Hey.

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:32.593
- Jurgis.
- What if he comes back?

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.497
If he comes back, we're screwed.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.298
It's gonna go a lot faster
with two of us, okay?

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:41.408
I'm gonna go this way. Fuck.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:44.114
Jurgis?

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.317
Jurgis.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.676
- Miss Jones.
- Did you find Jurgis?

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:20.218
Calm down. Please, sit.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.517
I just received the report
from an officer on the scene.

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:29.156
They went to the room you gave me.
There's nobody there.

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:32.261
But that can't be right.
They met the tenant in the lobby.

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:35.130
He let them examine the place.
He's been out the whole day.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.736
No.

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.537
He's a butcher.

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:40.470
Leon says that he slaughters people...

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.201
...he kills them.
He's seen it, photographed it.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.470
- What are you talking about?
- It sounds crazy.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.548
I didn't believe it either.
But I was in his room.

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.946
I saw the tools he uses.

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:53.986
Okay, let's talk about
what really happened.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:59.658
The tenant said a family heirloom
is missing, an album.

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:02.188
- He wants it back.
- It's a timetable.

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:05.094
With a check for every murder
going back a hundred years.

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.826
You cannot give that back.
It's the only proof we have...

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.834
Let me see it, please.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.809
The tenant doesn't want
to press any charges.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.443
He just wants his property back.

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.515
I don't have it.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.808
Jurgis does.

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.877
You have to find Jurgis.

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:29.023
Look, you've already admitted
to breaking and entering.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:32.251
That's very serious.
I could hold you for that alone.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:35.919
If you do not go back with me,
I'm gonna go back with someone else.

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:38.793
And you'll be arrested, Miss Jones.

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.917
Phil and Sue Bennet.
They buy what I tell them to.

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:58.416
But to give themselves
the illusion of free will...

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:01.089
...they wait for my third suggestion.

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:05.016
The Kleins. They'll want some
alone time with you.

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:07.787
Just a little postmodern chitchat.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.397
Humor them. It's a sale.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.664
The Franks.
Now, they never buy photography...

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.395
...but if anyone can convert them...

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:19.670
Jack, Andi...

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:22.201
...I'd like you to meet Leon.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.611
Andi thinks you're more like
a painter than a photographer.

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:31.281
Andi, that's...
That's very perceptive of you.

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.921
I actually started out as a painter.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:37.024
Duty calls. If you'll excuse me.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.731
Excuse me.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.297
Sure.

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:28.705
Come on, your public awaits you.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:35.310
I'm not holding my breath on that one.
A tad too bleak.

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.319
Leon?

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.885
Where are you going?

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.457
I said, where are you going?

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:49.622
I got a train to catch.

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:56.429
- No, you said medium rare.
- Hey.

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:58.196
Hey, zip it, huh?

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:00.637
It's hot. Hold on one second.

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:04.178
Hey, where the hell you been?
Excuse me?

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.041
- Where is it?
- Where's what? My...

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:09.409
Maya. All right, now you're
as crazy as your boyfriend.

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.415
What? Stop. What are you doing?

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.053
All right, Maya.

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.851
Stop right... Hey, hey!

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.581
Don't you... If you... Don't leave!

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:19.056
Maya! Maya!
Stay right there, honey...

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.922
Leon, are you there?

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:24.588
That butcher, baby, the butcher,
I think he has Jurgis.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.496
You... I... That cop, detective, I...

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:29.295
Miss Jones.

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:35.571
I want the book, Miss Jones.

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:39.771
Tell me what's fucking going on.

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:41.744
Now.

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.910
Do you have any idea?

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:48.482
Where is Jurgis?

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.122
Tell me.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.596
He's on the train.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:02.235
14th Street. First one after 2:00.

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.715
No!

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.212
No!

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.782
No!

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.016
Oh, my God.

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.063
Maya.

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:11.545
Oh, my God, Jurgis.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:14.807
Maya. Maya.

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.816
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.285
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:35.460
No!

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.339
No. No!

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.253
Hey!

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.452
No, Jurgis!

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:54.521
No.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.162
Leon?

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:18.002
Please, step away from the meat.

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:13.800
Take this...

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.552
Welcome.

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:04.290
He didn't have
what it takes anymore.

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:08.589
He knew it must be done.

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:09.785
It was a privilege.

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.329
I envy you.

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:01.137
Before you were born...

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:05.376
...or the birth of any other human thing,
that's how long.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.018
Or longer. And now you found us...

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:13.491
...as only a few before you have.

01:32:14.128 --> 01:32:16.653
The intimate circle
that keeps the secret...

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:20.191
...we protect and nurture them...

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:23.029
...and order is thereby preserved.

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:32.402
It must be done
to keep the worlds separate.

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.816
You'll understand soon enough.

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:28.498
- Now, serve as we all do...
- No.

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.000
...without question.

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.367
<i>Police say Miss Jones</i>
<i>and Mr. Thompkins...</i>

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:09.042
<i>... are only missing at this point...</i>

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:12.542
<i>... although foul play has not</i>
<i>been ruled out. Elsewhere...</i>

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:15.375
<i>... preparations are underway</i>
<i>for the arrival of leaders...</i>

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:17.551
<i>... of several nations</i>
<i>in the European Union.</i>

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:19.549
<i>The mayor's office</i>
<i>issued a statement...</i>

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:21.847
<i>... supporting prospects</i>
<i>of new opportunities.</i>

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:24.684
<i>Meetings are scheduled</i>
<i>with local business leaders.</i>

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:28.794
<i>The meetings will include a tour of</i>
<i>the city's harbor and transport facilities.</i>

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:33.464
<i>Stay tuned to WEQT for further</i>
