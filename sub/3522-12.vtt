02:07.594 --> 02:09.596
Had some great
naps on this settee.

02:10.096 --> 02:11.097
You okay over there?

02:11.097 --> 02:14.100
Shades of starving students,
santa monica,

02:14.601 --> 02:15.602
summer of'78.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.103
You were a mover?

02:17.103 --> 02:18.104
Yeah.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.606
How many jobs you
have in this lifetime?

02:19.606 --> 02:22.108
Enough to know
i don't want another one.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.111
Jan, these floors
have wonderful glide.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.613
You're
looking great, rick.

02:26.613 --> 02:32.619
Beautiful juliet,
beautiful.

02:33.119 --> 02:35.121
Richie's son is still
"flying down to rio"?

02:35.121 --> 02:36.623
Dad, must be
proud as punch.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.124
He is.

02:38.625 --> 02:42.128
Those two were top ten
in the embassy ball
championships last year.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.131
Ton',
hey, man.

02:45.131 --> 02:48.635
Jackie,
how's your rash?

02:48.635 --> 02:50.637
How you doin'?

02:50.637 --> 02:51.137
You want
a beer, t?

02:51.638 --> 02:54.140
No, no,
that's alright.

02:54.140 --> 03:00.647
Go join your
wastrel friends.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.149
What's the matter?

03:03.149 --> 03:05.151
Jackie aprile was a man
who loved knowledge.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.654
When he was dying of the cancer,
he was praying,

03:07.654 --> 03:09.155
his son would go
to medical school.

03:09.155 --> 03:12.659
If he knew he dropped out
of college, break his heart.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.160
It didn't hurt
the beatles.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.662
Bill gates.

03:15.662 --> 03:20.166
His uncle richie's
looking out for him.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.668
Easier than dealing
with his own son.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.670
Hey tony,
don't do that.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.673
Do you know he's taking aj
to the dirt bike championships
at giant stadium?

03:27.173 --> 03:27.674
Aj can't go.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.175
He got a "c"
in algebra.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.677
Does carmela
know about this?

03:31.177 --> 03:32.679
Alright, you really
want to know?

03:33.179 --> 03:35.682
I don't want him
around my kids.

03:35.682 --> 03:36.683
Who, richie?

03:36.683 --> 03:37.684
You heard me.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.686
What the fuck
are you talking about?

03:39.686 --> 03:41.187
Ask gia gaeta.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.690
Richie told me
all about that.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.693
The transmission
slipped out of gear.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.195
Richie's lucky he didn't
get crushed by the car too.

03:49.696 --> 03:50.697
And for your information,

03:51.197 --> 03:53.700
beansie gaeta owed him
major dollars for ten years

03:54.200 --> 03:55.702
and richie wasn't even
asking for the interest.

03:55.702 --> 03:56.703
Why not?

03:56.703 --> 03:59.706
And if we're so awful,

03:59.706 --> 04:02.208
why are you throwing us
an engagement party?

04:02.208 --> 04:04.210
'Cause you're my sister,
and i try to do what's right.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.213
Anyway,
it's my wife's thing.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.716
What's right include planking
that little russian girl

04:09.716 --> 04:10.717
of yours on the side?

04:10.717 --> 04:12.218
You know what,

04:12.218 --> 04:14.721
be in denial, be a co- dependent
to a fucking shit- bag.

04:14.721 --> 04:15.722
What the fuck
do i care?

04:16.221 --> 04:18.224
Your can't stand
to see me happy, can you?

04:18.224 --> 04:19.726
You motherfucker.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.228
Take that settee
and shove it up your ass.

04:58.765 --> 05:02.769
I love
my new pony boots, tony.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.778
Yeah, nice.

05:11.778 --> 05:15.281
Why don't you wear them
when you go on some
of your interviews?

05:20.286 --> 05:22.789
You call
sy littman yet?

05:23.289 --> 05:28.795
No, i'm doing it.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.296
There's good money
in modeling.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.298
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life

05:32.298 --> 05:34.300
behind the perfume counter
in a department store, do you?

05:34.300 --> 05:35.802
What do you care
what i do?

05:36.302 --> 05:41.808
Don't start
with the moody shit.

05:42.308 --> 05:43.309
What is that?

05:43.309 --> 05:44.811
"Chicken soup for the soul".

05:44.811 --> 05:46.312
You should read
"tomato sauce for your ass",

05:46.312 --> 05:47.814
it's the italian version.

05:47.814 --> 05:48.815
Ha ha.

06:00.326 --> 06:02.328
Why, you jealous?

06:02.328 --> 06:03.830
You fucking him?

06:03.830 --> 06:05.832
I can't have
a conversation with you!

06:06.332 --> 06:07.333
You're horrible.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.835
It's a fucking question.

06:08.835 --> 06:12.338
Maybe it's something
you ought to think about.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.840
What?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.842
Finding somebody who can
give you everything you want.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.844
I told you
he drives a fucking limo.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.847
Not talking about
those kind of things,

06:20.847 --> 06:25.351
i'm talking about a family,
marriage, children.

06:25.351 --> 06:28.354
I don't want
to find someone, i have you.

06:28.354 --> 06:31.858
What, to take you
out to dinner,

06:31.858 --> 06:33.359
and screw your
fucking brains out?

06:33.359 --> 06:37.363
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

06:37.363 --> 06:38.865
Tony, no don't go.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.368
You know, you don't know
what the fuck you want.

06:42.869 --> 06:43.870
Don't yell at me,
please.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.371
You know this
is a bad time.

06:45.872 --> 06:46.873
My new boss
is so mean to me.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.374
It's always
a bad time with you.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.376
With the cousins
and the landlords.

06:50.376 --> 06:55.381
Tony,
no, please no!

06:55.882 --> 06:56.883
Alright.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.886
Rin', you know it hasn't
been good for a long time.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.889
For either of us.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.390
Now, i'm worn out here.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.392
I'll die without you.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.394
No you won't, you'll forget
about me in two weeks.

07:08.394 --> 07:11.898
No, i'm telling you,
if you go i'll kill myself.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.400
Don't you fucking
threaten me, irina.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.404
This is over,
i can't do this anymore.

07:18.404 --> 07:19.906
I'm not gonna
do it anymore.

07:20.406 --> 07:23.409
You talk to that guy about
the modeling like i told you.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.913
Take care of you
until you get on your feet.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.915
But i'm not
doing this anymore.

07:28.915 --> 07:34.921
You understand?

07:34.921 --> 07:36.923
I hate you!

07:42.929 --> 07:43.930
So that's it.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.932
Albert splits nutley
with the d'alessio brothers,

07:46.432 --> 07:48.434
and barone here keeps
everything north of paterson.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.436
What else
we gotta talk about?

07:50.436 --> 07:52.939
Fairfield township's
taking bids next week

07:53.439 --> 07:54.440
what's there
to talk about?

07:54.440 --> 07:55.441
Fairfield's mine.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.442
Was yours.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.444
I don't give bids
to the handicapped.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.948
See obviously, richie,
you're fucking deaf,

08:01.948 --> 08:03.950
i told you ten times,

08:03.950 --> 08:06.452
then i find out
you're still dealing blow
on those garbage routes.

08:06.452 --> 08:07.954
For that i'm losing
a fucking bid?

08:08.454 --> 08:10.456
Next time you'll
find yourself in the back
of one of your trucks.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.458
Those are my father's
garbage routes.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.960
Shh, kid.

08:13.960 --> 08:14.961
Actually fellas,

08:15.461 --> 08:16.963
my cousin larry wants
the fairfield contract.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.965
The hardship of
his family and whatnot,

08:19.465 --> 08:20.967
while he's in jail
awaiting trial.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.469
See, this is why we have
a fixed bid club.

08:23.469 --> 08:24.971
'Cause everyone's
got a story

08:24.971 --> 08:26.472
about why they should
go to head of line.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.474
I've been in line
for ten fucking years.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.977
My uncle is just asking
for what my father
would have given him,

08:31.477 --> 08:32.979
if he was boss
when richie got out of prison.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.480
It had nothing to do with
they were brothers.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.982
You respected my father,
you should respect richie.

08:36.982 --> 08:40.486
Those who want respect
give respect.

08:40.486 --> 08:45.491
See, he just told you
to shut the fuck up.

08:45.491 --> 08:54.000
And he told me
to go fuck myself.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.002
This bill,
mel, jesus.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.005
I wish this fucking trial
would happen already,

08:59.005 --> 09:01.007
i'm hemorrhaging
sponduliks here.

09:01.007 --> 09:05.511
The minimization process could
be very good for us, corrado.

09:05.511 --> 09:10.516
We hire experts
to study the wiretap tapes.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.518
Former bureau guys,
very thorough.

09:13.019 --> 09:16.522
If they find abuses,
we take those findings
to the judge,

09:17.023 --> 09:21.027
and possibly have all
the wiretap evidence thrown out.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.029
That's fucking great.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.531
I know the feds stay on
the phone longer than
the 20 seconds they're allowed

09:26.032 --> 09:27.533
to see if
the call is relevant,

09:27.533 --> 09:29.035
i hear a click.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.536
I could be talking
about root beer,

09:31.037 --> 09:34.040
and sometimes
they stay on 40, 50 seconds
before they hang up.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.042
Pricks.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.543
But it'll cost,
the study.

09:37.543 --> 09:38.544
How much?

09:38.544 --> 09:40.546
200- plus hours
of tapes to analyze,

09:40.546 --> 09:43.549
and i want to bring on
specialized counsel,

09:43.549 --> 09:45.551
to handle
the wiretap litigation.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.553
Ballpark figure?

09:47.553 --> 09:49.555
Yeah, wrigley fucking field,
for chrissake.

09:49.555 --> 09:55.061
400 thousand.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.563
Did my nephew say where
i'm allowed to move the coke?

09:57.563 --> 10:00.066
He don't give a shit
about nobody but himself.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.568
This country's going
through boom times,

10:02.568 --> 10:04.070
there's more fucking garbage
than there ever was

10:04.070 --> 10:06.072
and he won't
let me eat.

10:06.572 --> 10:07.573
Now you wanna
cry money problems?

10:07.573 --> 10:09.075
I'm facing 20 years,

10:09.575 --> 10:10.576
i could die
in the fucking place.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.078
You're gonna
beat it, skip.

10:12.078 --> 10:16.582
You don't
fucking know that!

10:16.582 --> 10:18.084
That coke
is my lifeline right now.

10:18.584 --> 10:19.585
Break it down, jun'.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.087
What choice
does he leave us?

10:21.087 --> 10:23.089
You need allies to do
what your thinking about.

10:23.089 --> 10:25.091
Albert barese didn't like
what he was hearing.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.094
And by extension
larry barese,

10:28.594 --> 10:33.099
biggest fucking crew
in the family.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.600
That doesn't
surprise me.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.104
Larry's had
as much time as me

10:38.104 --> 10:39.605
to think about why
he's under indictment,

10:39.605 --> 10:41.607
and some other
people ain't.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.609
So, what do yo
u want me to do?

10:43.609 --> 10:45.611
Go talk to alley boy,
feel him out.

10:45.611 --> 10:48.114
But he's a slippery fuck.

10:48.114 --> 10:55.121
Don't commit.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.123
I'll see you.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.630
He's got tremendous moxie
for his size.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.633
Tell me about it.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.969
He's a fighter.

11:24.650 --> 11:25.151
What's this?

11:25.651 --> 11:26.652
Open it.

11:26.652 --> 11:27.653
I could see
it's jw gold.

11:27.653 --> 11:29.655
But we can't
accept gifts, sal.

11:29.655 --> 11:32.658
I'll pass it along to the guys
at the fireman's home.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.660
See,
that right there,

11:34.660 --> 11:37.163
you guys have a policy
and it's fucking stuck to.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.164
You don't
get distracted.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.166
Look what happened
with those egyptians,

11:40.166 --> 11:42.668
those motherless
world trade center fucks.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.671
Serial numbers
on an axle and you put
everyone of them behind bars.

11:45.671 --> 11:50.676
What the fuck
is all this?

11:50.676 --> 11:51.677
I owe you, skip.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.180
The rest of my life,
i'll never forget,

11:54.180 --> 11:56.682
you looked the other way
on that bevilaqua beef.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.184
What?

11:58.184 --> 12:00.186
The bureau would never turn
its head on a murder charge.

12:00.186 --> 12:03.689
Alright, what else could
you say at this point, right?

12:04.190 --> 12:05.191
What do you know
about scottsdale?

12:05.691 --> 12:06.692
Arizona?

12:06.692 --> 12:08.194
Yeah, i was thinking
i would pick there to live,

12:08.694 --> 12:09.695
when this
assignment is over.

12:09.695 --> 12:10.696
Assignment?

12:10.696 --> 12:12.198
You know, when i'm
in witness protection.

12:12.198 --> 12:15.201
They got more than
300 days of sunshine, golf,

12:15.201 --> 12:16.702
giant's spring training,

12:16.702 --> 12:20.206
naturally, i'm talking
about after i do
my two years in louisburg.

12:20.206 --> 12:23.209
I been thinking about taking
courses while i'm in the can,

12:23.709 --> 12:25.211
psychology, criminology,

12:25.211 --> 12:28.214
and maybe go give lectures
at police departments on o. C.

12:28.714 --> 12:32.718
That's an idea.

12:32.718 --> 12:36.222
An airline ticket
from the scatino bust- out.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.724
Tony made the guy
order blocks of these things,

12:38.724 --> 12:40.226
through
the sporting goods store.

12:40.226 --> 12:43.229
I'll put it on file.

12:43.229 --> 12:46.232
You could use it
as probable cause
for a warrant, couldn't you?

12:46.232 --> 12:48.734
Evidence of extortion,
intent to defraud,

12:48.734 --> 12:50.236
those are rico
predicates, right?

12:50.236 --> 12:53.739
First you have to tie
the ticket to tony.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.242
And he's too smart
to use any of them himself.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.744
He probably moved
them by now.

12:58.744 --> 13:03.249
However, this engagement party
for the sister,

13:03.749 --> 13:05.751
i'm gonna want
to wire you up.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.253
I know you're sensitive.

13:07.753 --> 13:08.754
Ah fuck that.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.756
What the fuck was i,
his errand boy?

13:10.756 --> 13:12.258
The saturn, yeah.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.760
Running all over
looking for his kid's
science teacher's car.

13:15.261 --> 13:16.762
What the fuck is that?

13:17.263 --> 13:20.266
Any faith i had went out
the window that very day.

13:43.289 --> 13:44.790
It's gorgeous.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.292
I know.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.793
Are you out of your mind
with all the arrangements?

13:47.793 --> 13:49.295
My planner did
rick cerone's wedding.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.796
So, all i do is,
i hand out money.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.798
And i have his card
for your.

13:52.798 --> 13:56.802
Your father's disappeared
and i ain't paying
for something like that.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.304
Oh, carmela.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.805
Carmela, i love
the new wallpaper.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.807
Do you think
i should do my den?

14:01.807 --> 14:03.809
Hey, do you have
that guy's number?

14:04.310 --> 14:08.314
Hey t, you still got any
of those airline tickets

14:08.314 --> 14:09.815
you got from
the scatino bust- out?

14:09.815 --> 14:11.317
Fucking creep.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.819
Who, rich?

14:13.819 --> 14:14.820
What happened
to that man in the can?

14:15.321 --> 14:21.827
Meadow, go help
your mother.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.329
You're in a little bit
of denial there,

14:23.329 --> 14:24.830
richie was always
a disturbed kid.

14:24.830 --> 14:31.337
So janice, i really don't
have a shot anymore?

14:31.337 --> 14:32.838
Having a good
fucking time?

14:32.838 --> 14:34.340
Alright, what do you
want me to say?

14:34.340 --> 14:35.341
I'm sorry.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.343
I'm glad for you.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.346
You should have seen m
a when we left the house.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.848
She really
wanted to be here.

14:43.349 --> 14:44.850
Could we go back to the part
where i was glad for you?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.852
You don't give her
a chance, tony.

14:46.852 --> 14:49.355
She's a completely
different person,

14:49.355 --> 14:50.856
since the doctors
put her on prozac.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.858
Put her on what?

14:52.858 --> 14:53.859
Janice!

15:01.367 --> 15:02.368
You're not gonna
believe this shit.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.870
They got the old lady
on prozac.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.872
She's changed, my ass.

15:06.872 --> 15:08.874
She's just too senile
to remember who she hates.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.877
What's wrong
with you today?

15:12.378 --> 15:16.382
What do
you care?

15:18.384 --> 15:21.887
Yo richie,
speech.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.390
C'mon, speech.

15:24.390 --> 15:28.394
Everybody...

15:28.394 --> 15:31.397
i want to thank
my future in- laws
for making a great party.

15:31.397 --> 15:34.400
And i want to than
k you all for coming,

15:34.400 --> 15:38.404
and celebrating with u
s this historical union,

15:38.404 --> 15:41.907
the apriles
and the sopranos.

15:41.907 --> 15:45.911
They say
it's never too late.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.414
They say all good comes
to those who wait.

15:48.914 --> 15:58.424
They're right
on both counts.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.426
You got anything to add,
little ricky?

16:00.426 --> 16:01.927
Glad for you, dad.

16:01.927 --> 16:02.928
Aw.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.430
Stepmom.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.431
Thanks, rick.

16:05.931 --> 16:06.932
Umm...

16:06.932 --> 16:09.435
okay, well i...

16:09.435 --> 16:13.439
i just wanted
to share my happiness
with everybody here.

16:13.439 --> 16:17.943
And i have been
looking for my soulmate
for all of my life.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.946
Madonn,
have i looked, right?

16:20.946 --> 16:24.950
I don't know what made me
think i was gonna find
anybody halfway decent

16:24.950 --> 16:27.453
in some ashram
in pradesh.

16:27.453 --> 16:31.457
But i found him,
right here...

16:31.957 --> 16:34.460
at home.

16:34.460 --> 16:40.966
And i just wanted to say
that you knock my socks off.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.970
God bless,
salute.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.501
Yeah.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.502
It was
delicious agony.

17:16.502 --> 17:22.508
Were you also pretending
when i kissed you?

17:22.508 --> 17:23.509
I got to go out.

17:23.509 --> 17:26.011
Oh you're wonderful.

17:26.011 --> 17:29.014
I'm ashamed of myself.

17:29.014 --> 17:32.017
Yes, you ought to be,
definitely.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.019
Thank god, i'm home.

17:34.019 --> 17:36.522
I'm in the shower,
i almost didn't hear the phone.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.023
She is drunk,
she is crying.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.025
She's took
20 sleeping pills.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.527
What the fuck
is she thinking?

17:42.027 --> 17:43.529
Aw, it's not her fault.

17:43.529 --> 17:46.031
Please.

17:46.031 --> 17:48.534
Look at you, you got one leg,
you don't behave like that.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.537
Her parents, both of them
were alcoholics in petrozavodsk.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.539
Horrible industrial city.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.542
The father died
55 years old,

17:56.542 --> 18:00.045
lung cancer,
cirrhosis of the liver.

18:00.045 --> 18:03.048
Probably good thing anyway,
he was not working.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.050
The factory
was closed down.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.552
She had to go
to kazakhstan

18:06.552 --> 18:10.556
to live with uncle,
crude, miserable man.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.570
Jesus christ, rin'.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.072
I don't care no more
what happen.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.074
Don't say that shit.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.576
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.577
So sorry, tony.

18:32.077 --> 18:37.082
The ambulance, emergency room,
how she gonna pay?

18:37.082 --> 18:39.084
You think they give
her medical insurance

18:39.585 --> 18:41.086
at that department store
she works in?

18:41.086 --> 18:42.588
I'll take care of it.

18:42.588 --> 18:45.090
What kind of life is there
for me without you, tony?

18:45.591 --> 18:49.094
To go back
to "bada bing"?

18:49.094 --> 18:51.597
To be a dancer?

18:52.097 --> 18:53.599
Be a prostitute
after that?

18:53.599 --> 18:55.100
I don't want to.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.102
I don't want to.

18:57.102 --> 19:00.105
Alright,
shh shh shh.

19:00.105 --> 19:03.108
Everything's
gonna be alright.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.610
Okay?

19:04.610 --> 19:09.114
It's gonna
be alright, shh.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.115
Perfect.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.117
Oh god.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.619
Look at that cleavage.

19:13.619 --> 19:16.622
Oh thank you, jesus.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.625
You know, i'm only
doing this for the presents.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.127
Well, i'm doin
g it for richie.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.128
He says he'd rather
go to vegas,

19:23.128 --> 19:26.131
but you gotta do
the ritual thing right?

19:26.131 --> 19:28.634
This is such
a happy time.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.637
All the flowers,
all the excitement.

19:31.637 --> 19:34.139
I remember
how i felt.

19:34.139 --> 19:37.142
Then there's honeymoon,
and the hope chest.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.645
You're working
overtime here, carmela.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.147
Remember how radiant i looked
walking down that aisle?

19:42.648 --> 19:44.149
You're depressed,
aren't you?

19:44.149 --> 19:47.152
Depressed?
No, i leave that to others.

19:47.152 --> 19:49.655
I'm just
being realistic.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.157
'Cause in a year tops,

19:52.157 --> 19:54.159
you're gonna have
to accept a gumar.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.161
Oh yeah?

19:56.161 --> 19:57.663
Well, i'd like
to see a gumar,

19:57.663 --> 20:00.165
that's gonna let him hold
a gun to her when they fuck.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.668
You let him hold a gun
to your head during sex?

20:02.668 --> 20:04.169
Yeah well,
if that gets him off.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.672
It's not different
than garter belts
and nurse's uniforms.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.173
Well, it's a gun.

20:08.173 --> 20:10.175
I thought you
were a feminist.

20:10.175 --> 20:12.177
Usually he takes
the clip out.

20:12.177 --> 20:14.680
Well, jesus,
i hope so.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.681
It's a ritual.

20:16.181 --> 20:23.689
It's fetishistic,
that's all.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.190
My 3- 0- 2s
from last week.

20:25.190 --> 20:29.695
Sure, c'mon in.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.196
Happy birthday chief.

20:31.196 --> 20:31.697
Thanks.

20:32.197 --> 20:35.200
From tony soprano.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.203
Never misses
an occasion.

20:38.203 --> 20:40.205
Christmas, columbus day.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.207
Have something to eat,

20:42.708 --> 20:44.209
before i send it
to st. Ambroseus shelter.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.712
My cw on that just gave me
a bottle of johnny walker.

20:46.712 --> 20:47.713
Cw 16?

20:47.713 --> 20:48.714
Bonpensiero, yeah.

20:48.714 --> 20:51.717
Fucking guy thinks
i'm his friend now.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.218
I know we're not supposed
to accept gifts,

20:53.719 --> 20:55.220
and i know poor people
are gonna get this,

20:55.220 --> 20:57.723
but i can't resist
the lard bread.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.224
He's turned some corner.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.727
One minute he's talking about
how much he loves tony soprano.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.729
And in the next breath
he's a junior g- man.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.733
Talking about rico predicates
and probable cause.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.735
All of a sudden
we're the good guys.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.738
The worst case
of stockholm syndrome
i seen since patty hearst.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.240
That was sad.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.743
I tell you though,

21:17.743 --> 21:21.747
i'm kind of worried
about sal with these
fantasies of law enforcement.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.249
These things can work
two ways, skip.

21:24.249 --> 21:32.758
You can find yourself
getting too close.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.761
So, you getting married,

21:35.761 --> 21:39.264
settling down, huh?

21:39.765 --> 21:41.266
One door opens,
another door closes.

21:41.266 --> 21:45.270
It's a fucking
expensive proposition though.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.773
I didn't need that shit
that happened the other day.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.275
You don't need that shit
that happened the other day.

21:50.275 --> 21:52.778
You talk to the king
of dermabrasion about
what went down?

21:52.778 --> 21:54.279
I'm talking to him,

21:54.279 --> 21:56.281
and he's looking at
his reflection in the plexiglas.

21:56.281 --> 21:59.284
Imagine getting
a facelift,

21:59.284 --> 22:02.287
one week later
you're in jail.

22:02.287 --> 22:03.789
Can you imagine that,

22:03.789 --> 22:05.791
you get a facelift and
one week later you're in jail?

22:05.791 --> 22:08.293
Anyway...

22:08.293 --> 22:12.297
i had the feeling you didn't
like what you were hearing.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.800
I already expected
to get fucked out of that bid.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.803
Now that's
a sad commentary.

22:17.803 --> 22:20.305
Richie, what's
larry gonna do?

22:20.305 --> 22:22.307
The fucking guy's
a guest of the government.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.309
While some people
are stuffing themselves.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.311
Some people are out there
stuffing themselves.

22:26.311 --> 22:28.313
Only larry's got
a trial coming up.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.816
He's in no position to go
into the unknown not knowing.

22:30.816 --> 22:31.817
How about you,
albert?

22:32.317 --> 22:34.319
Weigh in anytime.

22:34.319 --> 22:36.822
I'm with him.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.324
All things
being equal?

22:39.324 --> 22:41.326
No.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.328
Make a move
against tony soprano?

22:43.829 --> 22:44.830
No way.

22:44.830 --> 22:47.833
I don't know
what to tell you.

23:04.349 --> 23:05.350
Vic.

23:05.350 --> 23:08.353
Carmela, hi.

23:08.353 --> 23:10.355
Imagine running
into you here.

23:10.355 --> 23:11.857
How are you?

23:11.857 --> 23:13.358
I'm good,
i'm fine.

23:13.358 --> 23:14.860
And how are you?

23:14.860 --> 23:15.861
Good.

23:15.861 --> 23:18.363
Just shopping
for a roller.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.373
Look, vic,
truthfully.

23:28.373 --> 23:30.375
I'm not just
running into you here.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.878
I saw the name of the store
on your supplies,

23:33.378 --> 23:34.379
i wanted
to talk to you.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.381
Carmela, i'm sorry
i should've called you that day.

23:36.381 --> 23:38.383
Please, you have nothing
to be sorry for.

23:38.383 --> 23:39.885
I should have told you
i wasn't coming for lunch.

23:39.885 --> 23:42.888
That's alright,
i got the message when
you didn't show up.

23:42.888 --> 23:45.390
And that's why i wanted
to talk to you.

23:45.390 --> 23:46.391
I wanted
to thank you.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.393
For what?

23:48.393 --> 23:51.897
Maybe someday
i will be free.

23:51.897 --> 23:55.400
But if you had
come that day,

23:55.400 --> 23:57.402
i might have
done something

23:57.402 --> 23:59.404
that i would
be sorry for forever.

23:59.404 --> 24:03.408
And so i wanted
to thank you for thinking
for the both of us.

24:03.408 --> 24:07.412
For being strong
for the both of us.

24:07.412 --> 24:10.415
Thank you.

24:10.415 --> 24:15.921
Well, you're welcome.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.923
So goodbye, vic.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.927
And take care
of yourself.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.440
Thank christ.

24:35.440 --> 24:39.444
Jesus.

24:39.444 --> 24:44.449
You know
who she's married to?

24:44.449 --> 24:46.451
I need you to give me
the number of a good shrink.

24:46.451 --> 24:47.953
Oh?

24:48.453 --> 24:51.456
It's for a girl
i was seeing.

24:51.456 --> 24:55.961
What?

24:55.961 --> 24:57.462
"Was"?

24:57.462 --> 24:59.464
Yeah, i broke up with her
and she tried to kill herself.

24:59.464 --> 25:00.966
This was no
small cuttings.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.468
20 halcyon and
a quart of vodka.

25:03.969 --> 25:06.471
And the fucking ambulance,
they pumped her stomach.

25:06.471 --> 25:08.473
Cost me three grand.

25:08.473 --> 25:10.976
She should have been
seen by the psychiatrist
in the hospital.

25:11.476 --> 25:12.978
He was a romanian,

25:12.978 --> 25:14.980
and they have some beef
that goes back centuries

25:14.980 --> 25:16.481
and she wouldn't
talk to him.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.984
Do you feel responsible
for her suicide attempt?

25:18.984 --> 25:20.986
I was banging her
for two years.

25:21.486 --> 25:23.989
Was that
a hardship on her?

25:23.989 --> 25:27.993
That's cute.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.995
You know how many women
i've been through?

25:29.995 --> 25:31.997
I don't know why
i just don't say
fuck it with this one.

25:32.497 --> 25:33.498
Why do you think?

25:33.498 --> 25:36.001
She's a sweet kid
underneath it all.

25:36.001 --> 25:38.503
And i think she's
seriously depressed.

25:38.503 --> 25:45.010
You feel for her?

25:45.010 --> 25:47.512
I'm interested
in why you're ending it.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.514
What do you mean, why?

25:49.514 --> 25:52.017
Isn't that what
i'm supposed to do?

25:52.017 --> 25:54.519
Aren't you telling me that
all the time in here?

25:54.519 --> 25:56.521
I don't think
i've ever passed judgment,

25:56.521 --> 25:58.023
on your sex life,

25:58.023 --> 26:00.025
or any patient's
sex life.

26:00.525 --> 26:03.028
Even if i'm 20 years older
than her and i'm married?

26:03.028 --> 26:05.030
What's wrong with you?

26:05.530 --> 26:08.033
Why now?

26:08.033 --> 26:09.534
Why now?

26:09.534 --> 26:11.536
Because, it's
not fun anymore.

26:11.536 --> 26:14.539
Okay, are you gonna
recommend somebody or not?

26:19.544 --> 26:21.546
He's eating lunch.

26:29.054 --> 26:29.554
So?

26:30.055 --> 26:31.056
Larry's out.

26:31.556 --> 26:34.559
Aw shit, fuck.

26:34.559 --> 26:37.562
I knew it,
i fucking knew it.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.565
Here bobby,
take this, i can't.

26:40.565 --> 26:44.569
Larry and albert
are not the problem.

26:45.070 --> 26:48.073
It's tony that's
the fucking problem.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.075
You take him out
of the picture,

26:50.075 --> 26:52.077
and believe me,
everybody's gonna come along.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.578
Where else
are they gonna go?

26:53.578 --> 26:54.579
I'm sick.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.581
And fucking
larry barese too.

26:56.581 --> 27:01.086
I got friends
in federal holding that
would like nothing better

27:01.086 --> 27:03.088
than to take
that weak fuck out.

27:03.088 --> 27:06.091
He was a great friend
to my father,

27:06.091 --> 27:08.093
but he doesn't car
e who he follows now.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.095
I'd do him myself.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.096
Who's that
speaking here?

27:11.096 --> 27:13.098
Is somebody speaking?

27:13.598 --> 27:16.601
Listen, richie,

27:16.601 --> 27:18.103
let me think
about this awhile.

27:18.103 --> 27:21.106
We can't be too fucked up
by this setback.

27:21.106 --> 27:25.110
We gotta screw our
courage to the post.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.118
You're a good boy, richie.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.619
It's gonna be good.

27:34.619 --> 27:38.123
Go on home
, we'll talk.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.140
Fucking guy's fearless
for his size.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.642
That's nice.

27:57.642 --> 27:59.144
Then what?

27:59.644 --> 28:01.646
He fucking dies,

28:01.646 --> 28:03.148
i can't even
wear his shoes.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.149
What the fuck
you talking about?

28:04.649 --> 28:05.650
Fucking loser.

28:05.650 --> 28:07.152
He couldn't sell it.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.153
Richie?

28:08.653 --> 28:10.155
Pay attention, you just
may learn something here.

28:10.155 --> 28:13.158
Who am i
best off with?

28:13.158 --> 28:16.661
We best off with?

28:23.168 --> 28:25.170
Old man profaci knew
how to split his enemies.

28:25.170 --> 28:29.674
He couldn't
fucking sell it.

28:29.674 --> 28:33.178
He's not respected.

28:33.678 --> 28:39.684
But tony, with
his impulsiveness
and selfishness,

28:40.185 --> 28:44.689
he's locked up in that
fucking head of his.

28:50.195 --> 28:54.699
I'm better off
with tony.

28:54.699 --> 28:57.702
Definitely.

28:57.702 --> 29:05.710
I wanna see anthony at
the doctor's office tomorrow.

29:05.710 --> 29:06.711
What are you
looking at?

29:07.212 --> 29:11.216
I'm in awe of you.

29:11.716 --> 29:14.719
The dow jones industrial
average gave back all
of an earlier gain.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.221
It rallied more than
100 points midday,

29:16.721 --> 29:19.724
in the end it fell
two and a half to close
at 10, 675...

29:19.724 --> 29:22.227
hard at work?

29:22.227 --> 29:23.228
It's financial news.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.230
What the fuck
you doing here?

29:25.230 --> 29:27.232
The nasdac
is now in a...

29:27.232 --> 29:29.734
i got a line on
a car for adrianna.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.237
You want anything?
They got sodas, coffee.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.739
I got a bottle
in the drawer.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.741
Nah, i'm good.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.243
How's it going?

29:38.243 --> 29:39.744
This racket?

29:39.744 --> 29:42.247
We dumped webistics
and whacked up the payoff.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.249
Fucking license to steal.

29:44.249 --> 29:45.750
Anything you can
get me into?

29:45.750 --> 29:46.751
A pharmaceutical.

29:46.751 --> 29:49.254
They got a roo
t from the amazon,

29:49.754 --> 29:52.757
cures glaucoma,
it's all fucking bullshit.

29:52.757 --> 29:54.259
I got a brochure.

29:54.259 --> 29:57.262
Oh tonight, puss.

29:57.762 --> 29:58.763
I got something hard edge.

29:58.763 --> 29:59.264
What?

29:59.764 --> 30:00.765
Pokemon cards.

30:00.765 --> 30:02.767
Me and tommy mac are
taking down a truckload.

30:02.767 --> 30:03.768
Yeah, where?

30:04.269 --> 30:05.270
Tommy knows, you in?

30:05.770 --> 30:06.271
What, me?

30:06.271 --> 30:07.772
Yeah, c'mon,
old times.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.274
You don't want
a fat fuck like me around.

30:09.774 --> 30:11.776
I can't find the brochure.

30:11.776 --> 30:13.778
Anyway, what difference
does it make?

30:13.778 --> 30:16.281
You come in for five, ten grand
on this drug company,

30:16.281 --> 30:18.783
by the time we dump
the piece of shit

30:18.783 --> 30:21.286
you'll be in
six figure territory.

30:21.786 --> 30:22.287
Hey, puss?

30:22.287 --> 30:23.788
Yeah.

30:23.788 --> 30:24.789
The fucking car?

30:24.789 --> 30:25.790
What car?

30:25.790 --> 30:27.292
Oh, yeah, right.

30:27.292 --> 30:28.293
For adriana.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.296
It's an
m3 convertible, clean.

30:31.796 --> 30:34.799
I'll keep you posted.

30:34.799 --> 30:37.302
And not even
the big deal...

30:39.804 --> 30:40.805
you're kidding,
excuse me.

30:40.805 --> 30:42.807
Lipari.

30:42.807 --> 30:43.808
This is fat man.

30:43.808 --> 30:44.809
Who?

30:44.809 --> 30:45.810
You know.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.312
Sal?

30:47.312 --> 30:49.814
I just heard about they're gonna
jack a load of pokemon cards.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.317
Moltisanti
and another individual.

30:52.317 --> 30:53.318
Good, where?

30:53.818 --> 30:54.319
I don't know yet.

30:54.819 --> 30:55.820
I should ascertain, right?

30:55.820 --> 31:00.825
Excuse me, dear?

31:00.825 --> 31:02.827
You're a
cooperating witness, sal.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.330
You wear a wire,
that's what you do.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.333
So ask around,
see what you can find out.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.336
But i, in no way want you
going along in any hijack.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.338
You hear me?

31:13.338 --> 31:17.342
We let you earn,
but no violent crimes, right?

31:17.842 --> 31:21.846
Okay.

31:21.846 --> 31:26.351
Get out of here, i hate you,
you fucking bastard!

31:26.351 --> 31:32.357
Fucking mood swings.

31:32.357 --> 31:33.858
Was very
bad day for her.

31:33.858 --> 31:35.360
Yeah, when isn't?

31:35.360 --> 31:36.861
I went to modeling agency
like you told me.

31:37.362 --> 31:39.864
I waited four hour
s to see mr. Littman.

31:39.864 --> 31:40.365
So?

31:40.865 --> 31:41.866
Wasn't good.

31:41.866 --> 31:46.871
She didn't
get a job, big deal.

31:46.871 --> 31:48.873
Well, you gotta
start somewhere.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.876
I went in to see him,
and he told me i am too old.

31:51.876 --> 31:54.379
Oh, jesus.

31:54.379 --> 31:57.382
I'm sorry.

31:57.382 --> 31:58.383
I go make the tea.

31:58.883 --> 31:59.384
I told you.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.886
I told you,
it's all over for me.

32:01.886 --> 32:04.389
No it's not,
you're gonna be fine.

32:18.403 --> 32:23.908
Listen, i got the number o
f a guy i want you to talk to.

32:23.908 --> 32:28.413
I don't want to go to
no more fucking interviews.

32:28.413 --> 32:29.414
It's not--

32:29.414 --> 32:32.417
it's not an interview,
it's a shrink.

32:32.917 --> 32:33.918
A shrink.

32:34.419 --> 32:35.920
Yeah, psychiatrist.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.422
I know what is.

32:37.422 --> 32:38.923
He comes highly
recommended,

32:38.923 --> 32:40.925
you're gonna feel better
if you talk to him.

32:40.925 --> 32:42.927
I am not going
to no shrink.

32:42.927 --> 32:45.430
Yeah you are, 'cause
it's what i want you to do.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.931
You're not
the boss of me.

32:46.931 --> 32:47.932
Okay.

32:48.433 --> 32:49.934
You know what?

32:49.934 --> 32:51.436
Go fuck yourself then.

32:51.436 --> 32:52.937
'Cause i'm trying
to be a nice guy,

32:52.937 --> 32:55.440
went through a lot of
trouble to get that number.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.442
So he can send me to hospital,
lock me up?

32:57.442 --> 32:59.944
Psychiatrist is very
scary thing for russian,

32:59.944 --> 33:03.448
means being sent to gulag,
political rehabilitation.

33:03.448 --> 33:04.449
This is too
fucked up for me.

33:06.951 --> 33:07.452
What?

33:07.452 --> 33:09.454
Kiss off then.

33:16.461 --> 33:19.964
Janice, how do you open
this advil?

33:19.964 --> 33:25.470
Oh, nevermind...

33:25.470 --> 33:27.972
dad, i'm gonna get started
on your gutters tomorrow.

33:27.972 --> 33:29.474
That's great, kid.

33:29.974 --> 33:31.476
Richie, you gotta
take a look at this.

33:31.476 --> 33:33.478
I picked it up yesterday
at kuchensystems.

33:33.478 --> 33:35.480
It's very bauhaus.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.982
And it's not bad,
the basics cost 20 thousand.

33:37.982 --> 33:40.985
Janice, maybe you should
slow down on the spending
for the time being.

33:40.985 --> 33:42.487
Something wrong?

33:42.487 --> 33:43.988
What happened?

33:43.988 --> 33:44.989
I'm gonna take care of it.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.492
But things could get
fucked up for a while.

33:47.492 --> 33:48.993
Richie, if something's
happening to you,

33:48.993 --> 33:50.995
then it's
happening to me.

33:50.995 --> 33:52.997
Decision went against me,

33:53.498 --> 33:56.000
which impacts me
a great deal financially.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.503
Fuck!
Fuck i knew it!

33:58.503 --> 34:00.505
This shit
with your brother.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.006
It's been building
since i got out.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.509
You give him a jacket
you treasure and gives it

34:04.509 --> 34:06.010
to his fucking polack maid.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.513
But we're still
going ahead with everything
at the house, right?

34:08.513 --> 34:10.014
We'll see.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.016
Richie, they'll tiling
the pool on friday.

34:13.016 --> 34:15.520
And the atrium window,
i'm gonna lose the deposit.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.021
I said i'm gonna
take care of it.

34:17.021 --> 34:21.525
He just can't handle
that our house

34:21.525 --> 34:24.529
is gonna be nicer
than his fucking house.

34:24.529 --> 34:27.532
Fuck.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.533
What's the matter
with you?

34:29.033 --> 34:31.536
Nothing.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.538
What?

34:33.538 --> 34:34.539
Nothing.

34:34.539 --> 34:39.543
It's just sad,
that's all.

34:39.543 --> 34:40.545
What?

34:40.545 --> 34:42.045
Aj didn't have the flu.

34:42.045 --> 34:45.049
He didn't go with you because
tony wouldn't let him.

34:45.049 --> 34:49.554
He doesn't want you
around his kids.

34:55.059 --> 34:58.563
What happened?
What was that?

35:07.572 --> 35:08.573
Searchlight diner,

35:09.073 --> 35:13.578
5:15 a. M. , subject

departing searchlight diner.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.163
Soprano residence.

36:39.163 --> 36:40.164
Is tony there?

36:40.164 --> 36:41.666
May i ask
who's calling?

36:41.666 --> 36:43.167
Just put him on.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.669
Who is calling please?

36:44.669 --> 36:48.673
What are you, that polish maid?
I want to talk to tony.

36:58.182 --> 36:59.684
It's for you.

36:59.684 --> 37:00.184
Hello.

37:00.685 --> 37:01.185
Tony.

37:01.185 --> 37:02.186
I miss you.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.189
I love you.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.691
You got the wrong
fucking number.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.693
Don't call here again.

37:15.199 --> 37:16.701
I'll wait out there.

37:16.701 --> 37:19.203
Who was that, your little
russian girlfriend?

37:19.203 --> 37:22.206
Listen, it's
over between us.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.208
It has been
for a very long time.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.209
Bullshit.

37:25.209 --> 37:30.715
Why does your clothes
still stink of perfume?

37:30.715 --> 37:33.718
Okay, i saw her, but
it's not what you think.

37:33.718 --> 37:35.219
She tried
to commit suicide.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.721
Oh fuck you.

37:37.221 --> 37:39.223
I broke it off with her
and she tried to kill herself,

37:39.223 --> 37:40.725
she said she didn't want
to go on without me.

37:41.225 --> 37:42.226
The poor kid.

37:42.226 --> 37:44.228
You're putting me
in a position,

37:44.729 --> 37:47.231
where i'm feeling sorry
for a whore who fucks you?

37:47.231 --> 37:57.241
You know what's stranger?
For a second i believed you.

37:57.241 --> 37:58.743
Goddamn him.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.244
They're all
the same, carm.

38:00.745 --> 38:01.746
No, they're not.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.748
That man who did
my wallpaper,

38:03.748 --> 38:07.251
there was a male person
that you could respect--

38:07.251 --> 38:09.253
victor musto?

38:09.253 --> 38:11.255
Carmela, he didn't
show up that day,

38:11.756 --> 38:12.757
because of
who your husband is.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.759
Face it,
use your head.

38:15.259 --> 38:16.260
He pissed his pants.

38:16.260 --> 38:21.265
I don't want
to go to the gym.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.273
Better be good.

38:29.273 --> 38:30.775
I'm in the middle of
world war iii over there.

38:31.275 --> 38:34.278
When you're lying
in the street in a pool
of your own blood,

38:34.278 --> 38:36.280
don't say your uncle
didn't try to tell you.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.281
What are you
talking about?

38:37.281 --> 38:39.283
Richie aprile
is moving against you.

38:39.784 --> 38:40.785
He doesn't
have the balls.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.287
He's got a
legitimate beef with you.

38:43.287 --> 38:44.789
You're fucking high- handed
with everybody.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.290
Why don't you stick
to what you know,

38:46.290 --> 38:48.292
and leave your opinions
wherever the fuck?

38:48.292 --> 38:50.294
He approached
albert barese.

38:50.294 --> 38:52.296
And albert said no.

38:52.296 --> 38:54.799
Albert told you this?

38:55.299 --> 38:58.302
No, i got it from richie himself
at my house yesterday.

38:58.803 --> 39:02.306
He's gonna take you out
and larry barese,

39:02.306 --> 39:03.808
and anybody else
who doesn't go along.

39:03.808 --> 39:05.309
Alright, wait a minute.

39:05.309 --> 39:07.311
Why the fuck is richie
telling you all this?

39:07.311 --> 39:08.312
He thinks i'm with him.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.314
Really?

39:10.314 --> 39:12.817
What gave him that idea?

39:13.317 --> 39:14.819
It's what i wanted
him to believe.

39:15.319 --> 39:16.821
I've been
playing him.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.322
I seen this
coming all along.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.825
That's why i made
a big deal of that coke.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.327
I raised a non- issue
and he fell for it.

39:23.327 --> 39:25.830
So you're like a
double agent now, huh?

39:25.830 --> 39:27.331
Fucking matt helm?

39:27.832 --> 39:32.837
Fuck you.

39:32.837 --> 39:34.839
How do i know
you're not playing me?

39:34.839 --> 39:37.842
Believe what you want,
my little nephew.

39:37.842 --> 39:40.845
If i didn't
come to you,

39:40.845 --> 39:42.346
your fucking wife
would be a widow

39:42.346 --> 39:43.347
and your children
wouldn't have no father.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.851
So go fuck yourself.

39:54.859 --> 39:58.863
Alright, stop.

39:58.863 --> 40:01.365
I'm grateful to you.

40:01.365 --> 40:02.867
I am.

40:02.867 --> 40:07.371
I gave you five percent on
the action that was left to you.

40:07.371 --> 40:10.875
Kick it up
to seven and a half.

40:11.375 --> 40:15.379
But don't sell drugs
on those routes.

40:15.379 --> 40:17.882
It's shortsighted.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.898
You know that asshole's
marrying my sister?

40:33.898 --> 40:36.400
You got to wonder
where she is in all of this.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.903
My little niece.

40:45.910 --> 40:47.411
What's up, t?

40:47.411 --> 40:51.916
My future brother- in- law's
causing a serious problem.

40:51.916 --> 40:53.918
How serious?

40:53.918 --> 40:56.921
He's not satisfied wit
h the current leadership.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.422
He wants
to have me popped.

40:58.422 --> 41:02.426
That motherfucker.

41:02.426 --> 41:05.930
So now i gotta decide
what to do about him.

41:20.444 --> 41:22.446
I genuinely
don't think,

41:22.446 --> 41:29.954
there's anything to gain
by keeping him around.

41:29.954 --> 41:31.956
Get it done.

41:40.965 --> 41:42.466
Oh, and the planner
checked the almanac

41:42.466 --> 41:46.971
and he said there's
a 65* historical chance
of rain on the 12th.

41:46.971 --> 41:48.472
So he wants to get
a tent for backup,

41:48.973 --> 41:49.974
what do you think?

41:50.474 --> 41:53.477
I can't decide
on shit like that.

41:53.978 --> 41:54.979
Janice, c'mon.

41:54.979 --> 41:57.481
Okay, but when
you start bitching

41:57.982 --> 41:59.483
when you
see the bill, don't.

41:59.483 --> 42:03.487
My kid hit me up for
five grand to go to england

42:03.988 --> 42:05.990
for these dance contests.

42:05.990 --> 42:08.492
Little ricky's still
coming to the wedding, right?

42:08.993 --> 42:10.995
Rick,
rick.

42:10.995 --> 42:12.496
Richard.

42:12.496 --> 42:14.498
How many fucking times
i gotta tell you?

42:14.498 --> 42:17.501
It was "little ricky"
when he was 12 years old.

42:17.501 --> 42:23.007
Jesus, alright.

42:23.007 --> 42:25.009
He's still
coming, right?

42:25.009 --> 42:26.510
He wouldn't
miss an opportunity,

42:26.510 --> 42:30.014
to fucking foxtrot and tango
in front of everybody.

42:30.014 --> 42:32.516
Ballroom dancing
is a legitimate art form.

42:32.516 --> 42:34.518
Carries my name, richard.

42:35.019 --> 42:37.021
Fucking disgraziata.

42:37.521 --> 42:39.523
My nephew jackie,

42:39.523 --> 42:42.026
why couldn't
i have a son like that?

42:42.026 --> 42:46.530
You know, you came home
with a fucking attitude today.

42:46.530 --> 42:49.533
You know, i've been
in this house,

42:49.533 --> 42:51.535
cooking your
fucking dinner

42:51.535 --> 42:54.038
and taking care of that fucking
black hole upstairs all day.

42:54.038 --> 42:56.540
Keep your fucking voice down,
she hears everything.

42:56.540 --> 42:57.541
Not tonight.

42:57.541 --> 42:59.043
I gave her
two nembutols,

42:59.043 --> 43:01.545
i thought maybe
we'd want to have sex?

43:01.545 --> 43:03.047
But not likely.

43:03.047 --> 43:04.548
Put my fucking dinner
on the table,

43:04.548 --> 43:06.050
and keep
your mouth shut.

43:06.050 --> 43:07.551
No, you shut up.

43:08.052 --> 43:11.555
Just because
he's a ballroom dancer
you think your son is gay.

43:11.555 --> 43:14.058
What if he was gay,
what difference does it make?

43:14.058 --> 43:15.059
Ow.

43:24.568 --> 43:26.570
Fuck.

43:44.588 --> 43:49.093
What are you
looking at?

43:49.593 --> 43:51.595
You gonna cry now?

44:01.605 --> 44:04.108
Get the fuck
out of here,

44:04.108 --> 44:06.110
i'm in no mood
for your dramat--

44:32.636 --> 44:34.138
where is everybody?

44:34.138 --> 44:37.141
Aj is upstairs,
meadow's out.

44:42.646 --> 44:43.647
You better get it.

44:43.647 --> 44:50.154
Maybe she slit
the other wrist.

44:50.154 --> 44:50.654
Hello.

44:50.654 --> 44:51.655
Tony!

44:51.655 --> 44:53.157
I need you!

44:53.157 --> 44:54.658
I need you
to come over now!

44:55.159 --> 44:55.659
Okay?

44:56.160 --> 44:56.660
What's the matter?

44:57.161 --> 44:58.162
Is it ma?

44:58.162 --> 44:59.163
No, no.

44:59.163 --> 45:00.664
Tell me what happened.

45:00.664 --> 45:03.167
No i can't, say.

45:03.167 --> 45:04.168
What do you mean
you can't say?

45:04.168 --> 45:06.170
I can't say now.

45:06.170 --> 45:08.172
Think,
think a minute, okay?

45:08.172 --> 45:14.678
Just stay right there,
i'm gonna be right over.

45:14.678 --> 45:15.679
It's janice.

45:15.679 --> 45:16.680
Right.

45:17.181 --> 45:18.182
I got to go.

45:51.215 --> 45:51.715
Janice.

45:52.216 --> 45:53.717
Ton'?

45:53.717 --> 45:56.720
He hit me.

45:57.221 --> 46:00.724
It was an accident.

46:00.724 --> 46:09.733
Baby.

46:09.733 --> 46:10.734
Where's ma?

46:10.734 --> 46:13.237
She's upstairs.

46:13.237 --> 46:17.241
Out, she took
two nembutols.

46:17.241 --> 46:20.244
Ma?

46:20.244 --> 46:22.246
I didn't mean it, tony.

46:22.746 --> 46:28.252
I didn't mean it.

46:28.252 --> 46:29.753
Where's the gun?

46:29.753 --> 46:33.757
In the cabinet.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.778
If anybody called this in
or there's any shit about this,

46:54.778 --> 46:56.780
you don't got
to talk to anybody.

46:56.780 --> 46:59.783
What are you doing?

46:59.783 --> 47:01.285
Take a shower.

47:01.285 --> 47:03.787
Give me the clothes
and shoes you got on.

47:03.787 --> 47:05.789
Okay.

47:11.795 --> 47:13.297
What the fuck?

47:13.297 --> 47:14.298
They got away.

47:14.298 --> 47:15.299
What did
i tell you, huh?

47:15.299 --> 47:16.800
What did i tell you?

47:16.800 --> 47:17.801
I didn't go with them,

47:18.302 --> 47:19.303
i was following them
to the boost

47:19.303 --> 47:20.804
and then i was
gonna call you.

47:20.804 --> 47:21.805
What if they
would've spotted you?

47:21.805 --> 47:24.308
The moltisanti kid
and his friend.

47:24.308 --> 47:26.810
What was your
plan for that?

47:26.810 --> 47:27.811
That was the beauty part.

47:28.312 --> 47:29.813
I didn't even
use my own car.

47:29.813 --> 47:30.814
I switched with my son.

47:30.814 --> 47:32.316
You hit a
fucking 7- 11 clerk.

47:32.316 --> 47:33.817
How is he?

47:34.318 --> 47:34.818
In a coma.

47:34.818 --> 47:36.320
Fuck.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.821
They were gonna pinch you
for leaving the scene,

47:37.821 --> 47:39.323
but i got you
out of it.

47:39.323 --> 47:41.325
I owe you, again.

47:41.325 --> 47:44.828
Sal, listen to me.

47:44.828 --> 47:47.331
No, look at me.

47:47.331 --> 47:48.832
Look up.

47:48.832 --> 47:52.336
You are not
an fbi employee, sal.

47:52.836 --> 47:57.341
Okay, that's
not gonna happen.

47:57.341 --> 47:58.842
But i got
a lot to offer.

47:58.842 --> 48:00.344
And i hate l. C. N.

48:00.344 --> 48:03.347
I know i misspent
most of my life, i know that.

48:03.347 --> 48:05.849
I know fucking a- well,
we live in a society of laws.

48:05.849 --> 48:07.351
Sal.

48:07.351 --> 48:10.354
You are gonna help us buil
d a case against tony soprano.

48:10.854 --> 48:13.857
And then you're gonna do
your time for selling heroin.

48:13.857 --> 48:16.860
And then you get out
and start a new life.

48:17.361 --> 48:18.362
It's a good thing.

48:18.362 --> 48:22.866
It's a lucky thing.

48:22.866 --> 48:24.368
Sal.

48:24.368 --> 48:26.370
Don't be that way.

48:26.370 --> 48:28.372
I can show you
statistics.

48:52.396 --> 48:54.898
Whoa.

48:54.898 --> 48:55.899
I know.

48:55.899 --> 48:57.401
We don't got time
for that now.

48:57.901 --> 48:58.902
Get him out of here.

48:58.902 --> 48:59.903
Get rid of him.

48:59.903 --> 49:02.906
Bring his car
to the salvage crusher.

49:02.906 --> 49:04.408
Cadillac.

49:04.408 --> 49:06.410
I'll get something.

49:24.928 --> 49:25.929
Don't go.

49:26.430 --> 49:28.432
I'll be
right back.

49:47.951 --> 49:49.453
We got to
speed this up.

49:49.453 --> 49:51.955
You know what time these
humps come in for work.

49:51.955 --> 49:54.458
Fucking meat delivery
at five a. M.

49:54.458 --> 49:55.959
We're almost done.

49:55.959 --> 50:04.468
It's gonna be a while
before i eat anything
from satriale's.

50:04.468 --> 50:07.971
Uh, okay.

50:07.971 --> 50:11.975
Get a hose,
start to wash the room.

50:11.975 --> 50:15.479
Janice, is tha

50:15.479 --> 50:18.982
What are you doing
up so early?

50:18.982 --> 50:20.484
Ma, go back to bed.

50:20.484 --> 50:24.988
I just don't know
what happened to me.

50:24.988 --> 50:28.992
I had the strangest dreams
all night long.

50:28.992 --> 50:30.994
People coming
and going.

50:30.994 --> 50:32.496
Coming and going.

50:32.496 --> 50:37.000
I couldn't get up
off the bed.

50:37.501 --> 50:39.503
Tony,
tony.

50:39.503 --> 50:43.507
Anthony, what
are you doing here?

50:43.507 --> 50:46.510
C'mon janice,
let's go.

50:47.010 --> 50:49.513
Richie didn't
come home last night,
she's worried about him.

50:50.013 --> 50:52.015
Oh sure,
he probably jilted her.

50:52.015 --> 50:59.022
That's the story
of her life.

50:59.022 --> 51:01.024
What kind of a fucking
chance did she have,

51:01.525 --> 51:03.026
with you as her mother?

51:03.026 --> 51:06.029
You were always nagging her
about her weight.

51:06.029 --> 51:08.031
She goes on a date,
she comes home,

51:08.031 --> 51:09.032
you call her
a fucking tramp.

51:09.032 --> 51:10.534
I'm gonna wait
out in the car.

51:10.534 --> 51:13.537
I never said
anything of the kind.

51:13.537 --> 51:14.538
I heard you.

51:14.538 --> 51:16.039
You make things up.

51:16.039 --> 51:18.041
You tell me,

51:18.041 --> 51:22.546
you tell me when i ever
did anything to any of you.

51:22.546 --> 51:29.052
You don't know,
do you?

51:29.052 --> 51:31.054
You don't have
a fucking clue.

51:31.054 --> 51:32.055
I wasn't always perfect,

51:32.556 --> 51:34.558
but i always tried
to do the best i could.

51:34.558 --> 51:40.063
And i know you didn't,
any of you, didn't like it

51:40.063 --> 51:42.566
when i tried
to tell you what to do.

51:42.566 --> 51:46.069
Babies are like animals.

51:46.069 --> 51:48.071
They're no different
than dogs.

51:48.572 --> 51:52.075
Somebody has to
teach'em right from wrong.

51:52.075 --> 51:59.583
But i was your mother,
who else was gonna do it?

52:00.083 --> 52:03.587
If you ask me, i did
a pretty damn good job.

52:03.587 --> 52:13.096
That palace you live in,
up there on that hill.

52:13.096 --> 52:17.100
I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

52:17.601 --> 52:23.106
I suppose now
you're not gonna kiss me.

52:23.106 --> 52:24.608
What?

52:24.608 --> 52:26.109
You're cruel.

52:26.109 --> 52:31.114
That's what you are.

52:31.114 --> 52:32.616
Oh, fuck this.

52:33.116 --> 52:38.622
Oh...

53:06.149 --> 53:07.651
how you doing, hon?

53:07.651 --> 53:08.652
Who send you, tony?

53:08.652 --> 53:10.153
Yeah, he asked me
to bring you this.

53:10.654 --> 53:11.655
What is it, money?

53:11.655 --> 53:12.656
I don't want it.

53:13.156 --> 53:14.157
Yes, you do.

53:14.157 --> 53:18.662
75, 000 dollars
in here.

53:18.662 --> 53:19.663
75?

53:20.163 --> 53:22.666
Listen, irina
i know you're upset.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.668
Let me give you
a little advice.

53:24.668 --> 53:28.672
In my business
i see girls come and go.

53:28.672 --> 53:29.673
So i know.

53:29.673 --> 53:32.175
Time is
the great enemy.

53:32.175 --> 53:35.178
You have
a very short window.

53:35.178 --> 53:39.182
It's not good
to get too hung up
on any one thing.

53:39.182 --> 53:40.684
On the other hand,

53:40.684 --> 53:43.186
something new
always comes along.

53:43.186 --> 53:47.691
I've seen it a million times,
it's called "passages".

53:48.191 --> 53:49.192
It's a book.

53:49.693 --> 53:50.694
He's right.

53:51.194 --> 53:53.196
He's very smart man.

54:20.223 --> 54:21.224
Thanks.

54:21.224 --> 54:24.728
You're welcome.

54:25.228 --> 54:27.230
I'm not gonna
forget this, tony.

54:27.731 --> 54:28.732
I owe you.

54:28.732 --> 54:30.734
God, do i owe you.

54:30.734 --> 54:35.238
All and all though, i'd sa
y it was a pretty good visit.

54:35.238 --> 54:38.742
What's wrong
with our family tony?

54:38.742 --> 54:41.745
I go to a shrink.

54:42.245 --> 54:48.752
She says that our mother
is a narcissistic personality.

54:48.752 --> 54:51.755
Why she turned out that way
who the fuck knows?

54:52.255 --> 54:54.758
Grandpa vito was
no prize as a father.

54:54.758 --> 54:56.259
That's not all
the shrink says.

54:56.259 --> 54:59.763
She says that ma
is a person

54:59.763 --> 55:03.266
who was incapable
of experiencing joy.

55:03.266 --> 55:06.770
And dad, all he di
d was experience joy.

55:06.770 --> 55:09.272
Richie told me you
were going to a shrink.

55:09.272 --> 55:13.276
I used to suggest it and
you'd blow your sack at me.

55:13.777 --> 55:14.778
Maybe you ought
to think about it.

55:14.778 --> 55:16.279
You know,
go back into therapy.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.782
What'd you do
with him?

55:18.782 --> 55:21.785
We buried him...

55:21.785 --> 55:23.787
on a hill

55:23.787 --> 55:25.789
overlooking
a little river,

55:26.289 --> 55:28.291
with pine cones
all around.

55:28.291 --> 55:29.292
You did?

55:29.793 --> 55:31.294
C'mon janice,
what the fuck?

55:31.294 --> 55:32.796
What do you care
what we did with him, huh?

55:32.796 --> 55:34.297
You want to know?

55:34.297 --> 55:35.799
I loved him so much.

55:35.799 --> 55:38.301
You're gonna miss your bus.

55:38.301 --> 55:41.805
I'm sorry.

55:41.805 --> 55:44.307
I'm sorry.

55:44.307 --> 55:47.811
Alright, go ahead.

56:17.340 --> 56:20.343
Meadow, you have a ups,
it's up in your room.

56:20.343 --> 56:22.345
What are you
doing in here?

56:22.345 --> 56:24.347
You've been gone
all night.

56:24.347 --> 56:25.348
Half the morning,

56:25.849 --> 56:30.854
what the hell
happened over there?

56:38.361 --> 56:41.865
Janice decided
to go back to seattle.

56:41.865 --> 56:44.367
You're kidding.

56:44.367 --> 56:47.370
Well, what about richie?
He must be devastated.

56:47.370 --> 56:48.872
Richie's gone.

56:48.872 --> 56:50.874
What do you mean, gone?

56:50.874 --> 56:52.876
Gone.

56:52.876 --> 56:54.878
Where?

56:54.878 --> 56:58.882
Carmela, after
18 years of marriage,

56:59.382 --> 57:01.384
don't make me make you
an accessory after the fact.

57:01.384 --> 57:06.389
An accessory
after the--

57:06.389 --> 57:08.892
holy shit!

57:08.892 --> 57:09.893
Stop asking.

57:09.893 --> 57:13.897
Oh, my god.

57:14.397 --> 57:15.398
Oh, my god.

57:15.899 --> 57:17.400
I took care of it.

57:23.907 --> 57:26.910
That...

57:26.910 --> 57:29.913
that was not a marriage
made in heaven.

57:41.925 --> 57:43.426
What's all this?

57:50.934 --> 57:52.936
After meadow's
graduation,

57:52.936 --> 57:55.438
me and rosalie aprile
are going to rome.

57:55.438 --> 58:01.444
For three weeks.

58:01.444 --> 58:02.445
Excuse me?

58:02.445 --> 58:04.447
We're gonna stay
at the hassler,

58:04.447 --> 58:05.949
shop,

58:06.449 --> 58:08.952
and try and see
the holy father.

58:08.952 --> 58:11.454
What are people gonna say,
you take off for three weeks?

58:11.454 --> 58:14.958
You're gonna have
to chauffeur aj around
to his dentist and whatnot.

58:14.958 --> 58:18.461
And you've got
to find a tennis clinic,

58:18.461 --> 58:19.963
for meadow to join.

58:19.963 --> 58:22.465
Because if i have
to do it, tony,

58:22.966 --> 58:26.970
i just might
commit suicide.
