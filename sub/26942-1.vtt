01:02.987 --> 01:06.490
Hi, Claire.
How you feeling today?

01:07.724 --> 01:09.891
I'm feeling better
than yesterday.

01:09.893 --> 01:13.298
That's good. You manage
to get any sleep this time?

01:14.430 --> 01:15.963
I did actually.

01:15.965 --> 01:17.801
Brilliant.

01:20.703 --> 01:24.208
Right, I'll come back later
and we'll have a little chat.

02:23.533 --> 02:26.270
Is he a baby? Is he quite young?

02:28.572 --> 02:30.741
He said to continue taking them.

02:32.475 --> 02:35.280
- Claire?
- Sorry?

02:35.812 --> 02:38.913
He said you have to make sure
you keep taking them, OK?

02:38.915 --> 02:41.051
Joel, I'm fine.

02:42.519 --> 02:44.985
Please, just for
the first few weeks, OK?

02:44.987 --> 02:47.057
OK, I will.

08:05.809 --> 08:08.676
We live in
a multi-dimensional world.

08:08.678 --> 08:10.978
Each organism dependent on its

08:10.980 --> 08:12.981
individual level
of consciousness

08:12.983 --> 08:17.118
apprehends a dimension of space
extracted from time.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.887
Yes, Ben.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.322
So, the assumption is,

08:21.324 --> 08:24.459
we have to separate
ourselves from the...

08:24.461 --> 08:27.861
lesser dimensions
of other organisms?

08:27.863 --> 08:31.065
Not quite.
Our world encompasses theirs,

08:31.067 --> 08:35.270
although they are unable
to apprehend our wider reality.

08:35.272 --> 08:38.006
Take the simple consciousness
of an organism,

08:38.008 --> 08:40.006
like a snail, for example.

08:40.009 --> 08:42.208
They're unaware
of the past or the future,

08:42.211 --> 08:44.078
living only in the present.

08:44.081 --> 08:46.480
Driven merely by sensation.

08:46.482 --> 08:49.383
What about the dog?
They're conscious of the past?

08:49.385 --> 08:51.820
Remembering where
they buried a bone.

08:51.822 --> 08:54.756
Yes, good.
By virtue of their higher mental

08:54.758 --> 08:57.224
faculty and simple
consciousness,

08:57.226 --> 09:00.427
a dog can mentally
extract from time

09:00.429 --> 09:02.863
another dimension of space

09:02.865 --> 09:06.501
and so it lives in a world
larger than that of the snails.

09:06.503 --> 09:08.302
And us?

09:08.304 --> 09:11.973
We humans
with self-consciousness

09:11.975 --> 09:15.343
live in a world
of three dimensions,

09:15.345 --> 09:18.182
of space plus time.

09:19.515 --> 09:22.850
Perhaps,
there is a larger world still

09:22.852 --> 09:25.152
that includes ours
as ours includes

09:25.154 --> 09:27.857
the others and so it continues.

09:30.025 --> 09:32.060
So, we live in a world

09:32.062 --> 09:34.996
unaware of a broader existence?

09:34.998 --> 09:39.267
Exactly. We live in a
multi-dimensional universe but

09:39.269 --> 09:43.171
are conscious of ourselves only
in a three-dimensional world.

09:43.173 --> 09:46.874
We live in a real
physical world but perhaps

09:46.876 --> 09:49.042
we don't know it
nearly as well as we think.

09:49.044 --> 09:51.311
In fact, we may
scarcely know it at all.

09:51.313 --> 09:54.148
It has been said throughout time
that man has sought to

09:54.150 --> 09:57.285
enter this astral dimension
by means of expanding

09:57.287 --> 09:59.954
his consciousness be it through

09:59.956 --> 10:03.090
an out-of-body experience
or meditation, or the use of

10:03.092 --> 10:05.359
psychoactive substances.

10:05.361 --> 10:08.262
So, this week's assignment -

10:08.264 --> 10:11.498
"Is there still a higher realm,

10:11.500 --> 10:14.002
one that we cannot
yet comprehend?"

10:14.004 --> 10:17.171
A thousand word minimum, please.
Collect them from

10:17.173 --> 10:19.776
Corina as you make
your way out. Thank you.

10:22.044 --> 10:24.311
So, you're saying...

10:24.313 --> 10:27.080
with increased awareness
we can actually see into this

10:27.082 --> 10:29.017
astral world?

10:29.019 --> 10:31.755
There's a lot of research
to support it, yes.

10:34.390 --> 10:36.557
Seems a bit far-fetched.

10:36.559 --> 10:38.959
I don't know, I think the idea
of another dimension

10:38.961 --> 10:40.594
we can't see seems feasible.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.430
It's more than feasible.

10:42.432 --> 10:44.965
There's plenty
of esoteric literature on it.

10:44.967 --> 10:48.438
What if we could access it,
like find a way into that world?

10:51.240 --> 10:53.843
There is a theory
called astral projection.

10:55.177 --> 10:58.278
Through it, it's thought
you can detach your spirit from

10:58.280 --> 11:01.248
your physical body and enter
into another plane of existence.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.450
But it's a pretty
out-there theory.

11:03.452 --> 11:05.453
Perhaps you would each be best

11:05.455 --> 11:07.921
focusing your attention
on actual science.

11:07.923 --> 11:10.090
Do you think it's actually
possible then?

11:10.092 --> 11:12.594
Theoretically, yes.
Thank you, Corine.

11:12.596 --> 11:15.329
There are examples
of clairvoyance,

11:15.331 --> 11:18.031
using it to contact the dead
but I guess that's where

11:18.033 --> 11:20.336
it gets a little
more... abstract.

11:21.538 --> 11:23.171
Really?

11:23.173 --> 11:26.174
Well, like any discipline
it requires training

11:26.176 --> 11:28.179
or at least some
basic knowledge.

11:29.144 --> 11:31.411
Well, perhaps the science
of it would be a good place

11:31.413 --> 11:33.580
to start your research
for this week then?

11:33.582 --> 11:35.919
But I'll leave that
to each of you.

11:37.287 --> 11:39.487
- See you all next week.
- Gareth?

11:39.489 --> 11:41.258
Your coffee.

11:42.057 --> 11:43.894
Thank you, Miss Richardson.

11:49.399 --> 11:51.598
Thanks for adding
more work, Alex.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.669
So, have you read
about this then, Lys?

11:54.671 --> 11:57.104
- Astral projection?
- Yeah.

11:57.106 --> 11:59.409
I stumbled across
a little on YouTube.

12:01.378 --> 12:04.344
You know people
that claim to astral project,

12:04.346 --> 12:07.080
they experience exactly
the same sensations as someone,

12:07.082 --> 12:09.249
as a jet pilot
suffering from G-LOC.

12:09.251 --> 12:11.618
You can't be that narrow-minded?

12:11.620 --> 12:14.955
The mind's a powerful thing. I'm
sure with a few cognitive tricks

12:14.957 --> 12:17.124
anyone could be entertained
by the darkest corners

12:17.126 --> 12:18.928
of their subconscious.

12:19.528 --> 12:22.329
Besides, if you wanna believe
everything you see on YouTube

12:22.331 --> 12:24.364
why stop at astral projection?

12:24.366 --> 12:26.667
I'm pretty sure
there are literally pages

12:26.669 --> 12:29.137
dedicated to proving that ghosts

12:29.139 --> 12:32.406
and mermaids
and boogeymen are real.

12:32.408 --> 12:36.444
You can chase the Mad Hatter, I'm sticking
with psychoactive substances for my research.

12:36.446 --> 12:38.946
I wasn't sitting there
watching it all night.

12:38.948 --> 12:41.281
Aww, so what else
caught your attention?

12:41.283 --> 12:44.518
Whatever it was, it won't be as disgusting
as the filth you undoubtedly watch.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.257
So, you DO spy on me?

14:09.304 --> 14:11.741
Never thought I'd see the day
I'd find you in here late.

14:12.509 --> 14:15.479
Yeah,
that makes two of us.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.385
Interesting collection.

14:23.552 --> 14:25.221
What's it for?

14:26.423 --> 14:28.392
Bit in depth, aren't they?

14:29.325 --> 14:32.629
Well, I guess if we don't challenge
ourselves now, we never will.

14:34.530 --> 14:36.696
Glad to see you're finally
taking it seriously.

14:36.698 --> 14:38.267
Psst!

14:40.135 --> 14:42.639
Hey, Alex. You ready?

14:43.706 --> 14:46.110
That's my cue.

14:47.076 --> 14:48.542
Erm...

14:48.544 --> 14:52.512
The sun sets late tonight,
do you...

14:52.514 --> 14:55.248
wanna come and hang with us
at the Quad?

14:55.250 --> 14:59.222
Er, no... I just wanna get
this finished, but you go.

15:00.222 --> 15:01.391
OK.

15:04.124 --> 15:06.163
I'll see you tomorrow then,
I guess.

15:09.698 --> 15:11.134
Goodnight.

15:11.868 --> 15:13.270
Night.

16:43.525 --> 16:45.394
OK.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.432
I haven't
even seen the first.

17:59.434 --> 18:01.571
Ahh,
the sequel's better, anyway.

18:02.337 --> 18:04.907
- You're up early.
- Yeah, I know.

18:05.741 --> 18:09.309
Got an early night, tried
that astral projection thing.

18:09.311 --> 18:10.844
Useless.

18:10.846 --> 18:13.514
- There's a surprise.
- Yeah.

18:13.516 --> 18:15.915
Absolutely nothing.
Bloody useless.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.385
Told you. Wouldn't trust
anything she says,

18:18.387 --> 18:20.488
she'll have you looking
for Big Foot next.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.393
I don't know. I don't think you
should be messing around with that.

18:24.727 --> 18:27.995
Doesn't matter. I don't think
I was doing it right anyway.

18:27.997 --> 18:30.363
I was so tired,
I just sort of fell asleep.

18:30.365 --> 18:32.600
How were you tired? All you
ever seem to do is sleep?

18:32.602 --> 18:34.869
Well, the library session
took its toll.

18:34.871 --> 18:37.872
You read about it and still couldn't
figure it out. Sounds about right.

18:37.874 --> 18:39.907
Oh, so that's what
the books are about.

18:39.909 --> 18:42.876
Yeah, yeah.
Quite interested, though.

18:42.878 --> 18:45.011
Just thought I'd give it a go.

18:45.013 --> 18:47.081
Interest?
It's more like obsession,

18:47.083 --> 18:49.449
seeing as you don't even
research for classes.

18:49.451 --> 18:52.652
Well, whatever it is,
I'm clearly useless at it.

18:52.654 --> 18:55.355
Oh, well, when in Rome.

18:55.357 --> 18:56.659
Yeah?

18:57.626 --> 18:59.730
Do as the Romans did.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.828
OK?

19:01.830 --> 19:03.930
When you're in Rome
you talk to Caesar.

19:03.932 --> 19:05.799
Yeah, you're retarded, man.

19:05.801 --> 19:07.901
Professor Powell, dumb arse.

19:07.903 --> 19:10.337
He's the one who suggested it.

19:10.339 --> 19:13.540
Despite the awful misuse of that
analogy, that's actually not a bad idea.

19:13.542 --> 19:17.647
I'm... full of good ideas.
Obviously.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.696
Mr Harmann,
what can I do for you?

19:34.063 --> 19:37.131
I've been doing some
reading on astral projections.

19:37.133 --> 19:39.999
And I was just wondering
if, maybe,

19:40.001 --> 19:43.072
you could help me to understand it
a bit better? If you have time.

19:43.940 --> 19:46.373
Well, OK, what exactly
did you want to know?

19:46.375 --> 19:48.912
Well, I was thinking
about attempting it...

19:51.012 --> 19:53.881
But I want to know...

19:53.883 --> 19:56.083
Dunno, I just want to know
more about it first.

19:56.085 --> 19:58.486
Have you tried YouTube?

19:58.488 --> 20:02.422
Actually, I did try YouTube. Yes, that
was interesting, to say the least.

20:02.424 --> 20:06.559
But I dunno...
I just dunno where to start.

20:06.561 --> 20:09.764
Right. Where'd you get
your reading material?

20:09.766 --> 20:13.534
So, I spent a few hours
in the library last night,

20:13.536 --> 20:17.071
just going through
some reference books.

20:17.073 --> 20:21.040
Oh, yeah, they're a good place to start
but the majority are probably...

20:21.042 --> 20:24.044
outdated.
I've been asking the university

20:24.046 --> 20:26.713
to reinvest in
more material but...

20:26.715 --> 20:29.719
Apparently, funding's limited
for the pseudo-sciences.

20:33.955 --> 20:37.693
Can I ask why exactly
you want to try it?

20:40.663 --> 20:43.599
To be honest, it's something I
think you should be careful with.

20:44.967 --> 20:49.068
Besides, the university aren't exactly
advocates for that sort of thing.

20:49.070 --> 20:52.940
Well, it's just that since
we've working on consciousness,

20:52.942 --> 20:56.046
I just want a more practical
understanding of our spirits.

20:58.013 --> 21:01.984
Wow. That's how I started
on this journey.

21:03.085 --> 21:05.422
It's a passion for growth.

21:08.089 --> 21:11.926
I'm far from versed in it, but I have tried
it, although that was a long time ago.

21:11.928 --> 21:14.495
- Really?
- I was fascinated with it.

21:14.497 --> 21:16.796
It's a wonderful tool
but we need to

21:16.798 --> 21:20.737
learn a lot more about it.
It's not an exact science.

21:21.938 --> 21:25.972
The idea of astral travel is
rooted in most worldwide religious

21:25.974 --> 21:28.776
accounts of the afterlife,
where they describe the soul's

21:28.778 --> 21:31.480
journey as an
out-of-body experience.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.181
The idea is that
the spiritual traveller

21:35.183 --> 21:39.053
leaves their physical body and
travels in their astral body...

21:39.055 --> 21:41.792
through higher realms.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.092
So, when people say they've seen
a ghost, that's just

21:45.094 --> 21:47.497
like a glimpse
into another parallel reality?

21:48.163 --> 21:50.834
Sort of, but it's more
complicated than that.

21:52.101 --> 21:55.169
Things like UFOs, abductions,
psychic phenomenon,

21:55.171 --> 21:58.873
can't simply happen
in the three-dimensional world

21:58.875 --> 22:01.842
that we know,
and yet they do, right?

22:01.844 --> 22:05.246
So, those that don't understand
are quick to label them

22:05.248 --> 22:07.680
as paranormal, but normality is

22:07.682 --> 22:09.917
just an individual's
interpretation of reality.

22:09.919 --> 22:13.890
So, astral projection allows you to
contact spirits who aren't in our world?

22:15.124 --> 22:17.193
Amongst other things, possibly.

22:18.059 --> 22:19.860
You don't think so?

22:19.862 --> 22:21.996
I never came into contact
with any myself

22:21.998 --> 22:24.567
but I certainly wouldn't
rule out the possibility.

22:29.538 --> 22:32.305
I did read a great book
about religious

22:32.307 --> 22:34.941
spirituality and our ability
to connect with it.

22:34.943 --> 22:38.879
The author actually
used to lecture here.

22:38.881 --> 22:41.015
But budget cuts
relieved her too.

22:41.017 --> 22:43.153
- What was her name?
- Michelle Collins.

22:44.319 --> 22:47.089
It's definitely the sort of thing
I think you're looking for.

22:52.295 --> 22:56.095
But with your attempts,
I can't really tell you

22:56.097 --> 22:59.566
how to do it. I can only
describe how I did it.

22:59.568 --> 23:02.102
And that's not to say
it would even work for you.

23:02.104 --> 23:04.708
No, of course. But just
any help would be great.

23:12.347 --> 23:16.049
I need a decent house party
tonight. You lads up for it?

23:16.051 --> 23:18.087
I'm up for it.

23:18.954 --> 23:21.156
- You?
- Sure.

23:22.991 --> 23:25.828
- Are we keeping you from something?
- Just emails.

23:26.596 --> 23:28.696
Yeah, that doesn't...

23:28.698 --> 23:31.030
- How about you two?
- How about us two what?

23:31.032 --> 23:33.700
- House party tonight.
- Without a doubt. I'm in.

23:33.702 --> 23:35.936
Alex, are you going?

23:35.938 --> 23:38.372
Erm, sorry, I don't think
I'm going to be able to make it

23:38.374 --> 23:40.210
tonight but I'll talk to you
later, OK?

23:41.844 --> 23:44.010
- What's up with him?
- Maybe...

23:44.012 --> 23:45.946
found himself a girl.

23:45.948 --> 23:48.282
Well, I'm definitely
up for tonight.

23:48.284 --> 23:50.620
- Good. It's a date then.
- You wish.

23:55.891 --> 23:58.562
Right. Yeah.

23:59.996 --> 24:02.863
No, I don't care but this
is because of what you did.

24:02.865 --> 24:05.734
You had an opportunity to say
something and you never did.

24:06.902 --> 24:11.074
Right, but you've only started with all
of this now in an attempt to fix things.

24:12.642 --> 24:14.076
Look, Dad.

24:14.977 --> 24:17.210
OK, OK. OK!

24:17.212 --> 24:19.747
Look, alright,
you've said your piece.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.149
No, I never said
it was your fault!

24:22.151 --> 24:24.852
But listen you're supposed to be
the one person

24:24.854 --> 24:28.087
I can come to about everything, and the
fact that you've hidden it from me

24:28.089 --> 24:30.059
for so long is
what hurts the most.

24:34.096 --> 24:36.663
No, no, it's simple. She's dead.

24:36.665 --> 24:40.102
Yeah, and you've left me
to deal with that on my own.

24:41.836 --> 24:44.840
No, that choice was yours.
You know what, I'm done.

25:00.855 --> 25:03.323
<i>21 seems a bit late
for all this, Dad.</i>

25:03.325 --> 25:05.362
It adds a lot of questions.

25:07.962 --> 25:09.898
<i>A lot of questions.</i>

25:16.872 --> 25:20.173
You know maybe I'd have
understood how you felt

25:20.175 --> 25:23.312
but it just feels like you've
left me out of everything.

25:34.789 --> 25:36.259
You were so young.

25:37.893 --> 25:39.863
I didn't know when to tell you.

25:40.462 --> 25:44.433
You can't...
You can't do this. Not now.

25:53.342 --> 25:54.908
Look, Alex...

25:54.910 --> 25:57.510
No, no, you waited way too long
for this.

25:57.512 --> 26:01.083
You can't do this to me now because you're
only doing it to try and fix things.

26:09.525 --> 26:11.928
I thought things
were getting better.

27:10.586 --> 27:13.386
- You alright, girl?
- Yeah, can I just get through?

27:13.388 --> 27:15.924
Please? Thanks. Sorry.

27:48.423 --> 27:51.126
Hey, Alex, it's Alyssa.

27:53.494 --> 27:55.629
I know you weren't planning on

27:55.631 --> 27:58.368
coming to the party tonight
but...

27:59.969 --> 28:02.471
Well, I just wanted to see
if you changed your mind?

28:05.039 --> 28:07.176
Call me when you get a chance.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.288
This is all
I really have to give you.

29:26.955 --> 29:28.323
You wanna do this?

29:31.727 --> 29:35.398
<i>The first thing you need to
do is find somewhere comfortable.</i>

29:38.433 --> 29:40.569
<i>But you don't want to be tired.</i>

29:41.636 --> 29:44.603
<i>You need to lay on your back
and rest your eyes.</i>

29:44.605 --> 29:47.609
<i>You will get urges to move,
ignore them.</i>

29:50.378 --> 29:52.548
<i>Concentrate on your breathing.</i>

29:55.049 --> 29:58.651
<i>You are tricking the brain to
think that the body is dreaming.</i>

29:58.653 --> 30:01.621
<i>This activates body paralysis,</i>

30:01.623 --> 30:04.661
<i>a transitional state between
wakefulness and sleep.</i>

30:07.261 --> 30:10.330
<i>But when this happens
you can separate from your</i>

30:10.332 --> 30:13.033
<i>paralysed physical body.</i>

30:13.035 --> 30:14.735
<i>And undertaking this I,</i>

30:14.737 --> 30:17.105
<i>I always choose to consider
the following verses.</i>

30:18.140 --> 30:20.407
<i>I am at total peace.</i>

30:20.409 --> 30:23.079
<i>I am connected
to all that exists.</i>

30:24.078 --> 30:27.282
I am empowered
to travel wherever I wish to go.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.490
I will be protected mentally,

30:36.724 --> 30:39.227
physically and spiritually.

31:20.769 --> 31:22.270
Hello.

31:27.709 --> 31:31.514
Sorry, I ended up
crashing early again.

31:37.219 --> 31:39.188
Just getting up now.

31:44.492 --> 31:47.195
I've got some news.
I'll see ya in a bit.

31:49.730 --> 31:53.336
No, no, you guys probably
won't believe me, anyway.

31:55.203 --> 31:56.772
OK, bye.

32:10.586 --> 32:13.219
Hey, I did it.

32:13.221 --> 32:15.822
I swear. I could actually see
myself out of body.

32:15.824 --> 32:19.191
Please, don't tell me you're still
going on at this astral thing?

32:19.193 --> 32:21.728
Well, there's no need to
go on about it because

32:21.730 --> 32:24.131
I've perfected it.
I'm a genuine projectionist.

32:24.133 --> 32:26.836
You can't perfect something
in a night.

32:27.368 --> 32:29.137
Film it.

32:30.138 --> 32:32.507
See if you could actually
move something in a room.

32:33.142 --> 32:35.178
You can't move things.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.511
I mean, your physical body

32:38.513 --> 32:40.779
vibrates at a different density
to your astral body,

32:40.781 --> 32:43.251
so you can't affect things
from the astral world.

32:43.785 --> 32:46.318
Then how is it that a
poltergeist can move stuff then?

32:46.320 --> 32:48.654
They're not physical?

32:48.656 --> 32:51.690
A poltergeist is a just a subconscious
extension of someone present in the room.

32:51.692 --> 32:54.760
They show the same physical
characteristics as that person

32:54.762 --> 32:57.197
but do it in an
unseen dimension.

32:57.199 --> 33:00.667
Although they operate in the same
space, your astral body is immaterial

33:00.669 --> 33:02.839
and can't have any effect
on physical matter.

33:03.771 --> 33:06.741
I thought you only knew
a little bit about it.

33:07.442 --> 33:10.779
Wow. Am I the only
sane one here?

33:11.846 --> 33:14.914
OK, Let's assume for a moment
that there's actually

33:14.916 --> 33:17.651
something to this.
Why not find a way to prove it?

33:17.653 --> 33:18.788
How?

33:20.422 --> 33:22.855
A spirit's an energy source,
right?

33:22.857 --> 33:25.824
OK, then why not use
something designed to detect

33:25.826 --> 33:29.930
energy. Like a...
like a weighted pendulum?

33:29.932 --> 33:33.400
- What's that?
- It's essentially a body of mass,

33:33.402 --> 33:35.568
suspended by a piece of string

33:35.570 --> 33:37.737
designed to detect resistance.

33:37.739 --> 33:40.707
You could use a silk wire,
it'll heighten sensitivity

33:40.709 --> 33:42.879
and given a little bit
of energy and it will swing.

33:44.846 --> 33:47.213
Actually, that might work.

33:47.215 --> 33:50.382
All you've have to do is touch the
pendulum during an astral projection.

33:50.384 --> 33:53.753
Yes! Right, I may know a trick
to recording it on your webcam.

33:53.755 --> 33:57.856
I could help you set it up although
I expect my cut once it goes viral.

33:57.858 --> 34:00.526
Say... 70%?

34:00.528 --> 34:02.865
69?

34:10.572 --> 34:12.771
<i>Is that the pendulum thing?</i>

34:12.773 --> 34:15.373
<i>Yeah, I looked it up online
they gave like</i>

34:15.376 --> 34:17.677
<i>a basic idea of the design
and then I just borrowed</i>

34:17.679 --> 34:20.215
<i>a couple of things
from the science department.</i>

34:20.849 --> 34:24.483
<i>Looks legit. Alright I set the laptop
up to record though its own webcam,</i>

34:24.485 --> 34:26.920
so literally just click
on it when you want to start

34:26.922 --> 34:28.987
but make sure you turn it off
when you're done.

34:28.989 --> 34:30.826
<i>Shit eats space.</i>

34:33.295 --> 34:34.429
Break a leg.

34:48.577 --> 34:51.510
I'm just saying
he's been really distant lately.

34:51.512 --> 34:53.880
I honestly think you're reading
way too much into this.

34:53.882 --> 34:56.047
I just wanna make sure
he's alright.

34:56.050 --> 34:58.550
Why don't you just tell him
how you feel?

34:58.552 --> 35:01.354
Yeah, great idea.
How about this?

35:01.356 --> 35:03.822
Hey, Alex, you going to class?

35:03.824 --> 35:07.360
Oh, by the way, I'm secretly
harbouring feelings for you

35:07.362 --> 35:08.894
It's a start.

35:08.896 --> 35:12.032
No. He's got his own problems,
anyway.

35:12.034 --> 35:13.702
Like?

35:15.336 --> 35:17.804
Just this argument I overheard.

35:17.806 --> 35:19.972
He was having it with his dad.

35:19.974 --> 35:21.409
About what?

35:22.344 --> 35:24.447
Just their relationship,
I think.

35:26.414 --> 35:28.583
I've never seen him
get so upset before.

35:31.452 --> 35:33.688
He didn't even know
he lost his mum.

35:34.856 --> 35:36.959
How long were you
standing there for?

35:37.925 --> 35:39.561
Long enough.

35:43.831 --> 35:47.867
Hey, maybe that's what his obsession
is with this astral stuff.

35:47.869 --> 35:49.769
- Really?
- Yeah, Professor Powell

35:49.771 --> 35:52.671
did say that people actually
use it to contact spirits.

35:52.673 --> 35:54.941
Maybe he's just genuinely
interested in it.

35:54.943 --> 35:57.476
Please, it's reading.

35:57.478 --> 35:59.814
When has he ever
been interested in that.

36:00.581 --> 36:02.949
Oh!

36:02.951 --> 36:05.588
Ever since he's started with this damn
astral stuff he's been acting so weird.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.990
He barely even
texts me back anymore.

36:55.670 --> 36:58.070
<i>Mentally, physically,</i>

36:58.072 --> 37:00.542
<i>spiritually.</i>

39:11.273 --> 39:13.976
Just remember
the camera was on.

39:14.608 --> 39:16.775
Some things are impossible
to unsee.

39:16.777 --> 39:18.112
Just play it.

39:21.215 --> 39:22.750
Yeah, go forward.

39:27.588 --> 39:29.856
- That's it. Stop.
- Where?

39:29.858 --> 39:31.824
That. Go back.

39:31.826 --> 39:34.762
Stop. Play it from there. Watch.

39:41.570 --> 39:43.239
That's all it does?

39:43.938 --> 39:46.875
- Sure there wasn't a draft?
- No, I shut the window.

39:47.309 --> 39:49.641
Bit early for you guys,
isn't it?

39:49.643 --> 39:52.679
You wanted proof? Jordan helped
me to record it last night.

39:52.681 --> 39:55.081
Just looked through the footage.
The pendulum moved.

39:55.083 --> 39:57.820
- Have a look.
- Let's see it then.

40:02.856 --> 40:04.990
That's it? Wow. That's...

40:04.992 --> 40:07.293
definitely worth the wait,
thanks, Alex.

40:07.295 --> 40:10.063
Bit of a stretch
to call it proof though.

40:10.065 --> 40:13.733
No, the pendulum moved. That's ridiculous.
Then it doesn't matter what I do.

40:13.735 --> 40:16.135
Oi, I swear, I was outside
of my body

40:16.137 --> 40:18.807
looking down at myself.
I got up.

40:19.907 --> 40:22.608
I walked past the pendulum.

40:22.610 --> 40:24.913
I stuck my arm out to move it.

40:25.947 --> 40:27.981
Then...

40:27.983 --> 40:31.120
There. More proof.

40:32.152 --> 40:33.855
I only pushed it once.

40:36.190 --> 40:38.657
Wait, this was later.

40:38.659 --> 40:41.927
I was asleep. Look, I was rolling around,
the pendulum shouldn't have moved.

40:41.929 --> 40:43.862
Maybe
there was a draft?

40:43.864 --> 40:46.032
That's what Jordan said,
but I shut

40:46.034 --> 40:48.170
the window, plus that
would debunk the first time.

40:57.978 --> 41:00.380
Astral attempt number two.

41:00.382 --> 41:02.885
The time now is 10:46.

44:50.945 --> 44:52.847
Hey.

44:59.554 --> 45:01.956
D'you see what I mean?
It's weird, right?

45:03.992 --> 45:06.829
- Yeah.
- So, that must be me?

45:09.163 --> 45:11.930
Nah, doesn't make any sense.

45:11.932 --> 45:15.036
- Surely you can't record your own spirit?
- Well, what else could it be?

46:28.242 --> 46:30.913
You alright? You're in late.

46:32.045 --> 46:34.382
Yeah, I had a few things
to take care of.

46:36.684 --> 46:40.055
I'm gonna go to bed. Night.

46:40.554 --> 46:42.023
Night.

46:48.362 --> 46:51.165
- I'm going to bed.
- And?

47:03.744 --> 47:06.280
- Night.
- Dickhead.

48:15.750 --> 48:18.284
What happened to you?

48:18.286 --> 48:21.056
It's stupid, I fell off that damn chair
this morning putting something away.

48:21.688 --> 48:24.356
It's your bloody fault I thought
it was the only one there.

48:24.358 --> 48:26.559
I wasn't here this morning
I had an early lecture.

48:26.561 --> 48:28.226
That's weird.

48:28.228 --> 48:29.497
What is?

48:30.164 --> 48:32.430
I could swear last night
I saw something standing

48:32.432 --> 48:34.668
in the living area when
I went to turn the lights out.

48:38.405 --> 48:40.572
Really? Like what?

48:40.574 --> 48:44.677
I don't know. I mean,
it looked like a person but

48:44.679 --> 48:48.215
when I went to turn the lights back on.
There was nothing there.

48:52.152 --> 48:53.885
That's it.

48:53.887 --> 48:56.387
It's ghosts. It's the only
plausible explanation.

48:56.389 --> 48:58.527
No, Ben. I'm telling you
something was there.

52:18.793 --> 52:20.862
Why are you two
talking in the dark?

53:17.083 --> 53:19.320
Yes, please, send him through.

53:24.525 --> 53:26.758
- Dr Leafler.
- Hello, Alex.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.561
Please, call me, James.
Have a seat.

53:29.563 --> 53:31.597
Thanks for seeing me.

53:31.599 --> 53:34.032
I really wasn't sure
what to make of your call.

53:34.034 --> 53:36.568
I understand from your emails

53:36.570 --> 53:38.871
that you've experienced
a shadow person.

53:38.873 --> 53:40.608
Yeah.

53:41.141 --> 53:44.976
Well, it's, a little more
than a singular experience.

53:44.978 --> 53:46.847
I mean I woke up,

53:47.547 --> 53:49.947
the other evening, last night,

53:49.949 --> 53:52.553
just in the middle
of the night...

53:55.456 --> 53:57.889
So it felt like a dream.

53:57.891 --> 54:01.159
But it was so real,
I keep seeing things.

54:01.161 --> 54:05.032
And now even my flatmates,
they're seeing things to.

54:05.699 --> 54:07.865
I have to be completely
honest with you,

54:07.867 --> 54:10.469
I don't usually
meet with people this quickly.

54:10.471 --> 54:12.438
Why am I different?

54:12.440 --> 54:15.143
In a word. That pendant.

54:17.177 --> 54:20.514
- This?
- Yes, I've only seen one like it before.

54:20.947 --> 54:23.083
Coupled with your name.

54:28.688 --> 54:30.724
Perhaps I should explain fully.

54:32.626 --> 54:36.664
I've spent years trying to better
understand the shadow people.

54:37.197 --> 54:39.998
I trained some years ago
and the basis of my

54:40.000 --> 54:43.605
psychological training
was at a facility in Kent.

54:48.608 --> 54:51.108
<i>I'd been assigned a patient
who had been</i>

54:51.110 --> 54:53.748
<i>exhibiting signs of psychosis.</i>

54:57.184 --> 55:00.054
<i>I believe that patient
was your mother.</i>

55:07.695 --> 55:11.199
So you... you treated my mother?

55:15.568 --> 55:17.739
You're the reason she came home.

55:19.273 --> 55:21.974
You're the reason
she was released early.

55:21.976 --> 55:24.842
Alex, please understand,

55:24.844 --> 55:27.813
Your mother's condition
was coupled with these visions.

55:27.815 --> 55:30.617
This is unlike anything
we'd seen before.

55:32.552 --> 55:34.521
This is a joke. I mean...

55:35.789 --> 55:37.892
It's got to be a joke.

55:38.726 --> 55:42.564
What you expect me
to take advice from you?

55:42.996 --> 55:45.697
Given what you've put
my family through.

55:45.699 --> 55:47.766
How dare you.

55:47.768 --> 55:49.735
Sorry, what...

55:49.737 --> 55:52.704
What exactly is it
you want from me?

55:52.706 --> 55:56.842
Another experiment?
Some remorse for what you did?

55:56.844 --> 56:00.012
I understand much more now than I
did back then, please know that.

56:01.849 --> 56:03.882
I recognise that you're upset

56:03.884 --> 56:06.751
but I maybe the only person
who can help you now.

56:06.753 --> 56:09.656
I believe this is only
going to get worse.

59:18.411 --> 59:20.013
Alex!

59:21.014 --> 59:23.151
- Lyssa?
- Hey.

59:24.284 --> 59:27.284
Hi. What are you doing here?

59:27.286 --> 59:31.222
I was wondering
if we could have a chat?

59:31.224 --> 59:34.027
Yeah, yeah, come in.

01:00:01.954 --> 01:00:04.322
What are you doing?

01:00:04.324 --> 01:00:06.728
Nothing. I just thought
I heard something outside.

01:00:08.362 --> 01:00:09.497
Really?

01:00:10.864 --> 01:00:12.197
Sorry.

01:00:16.103 --> 01:00:18.773
Just some weird things
have been happening.

01:00:19.873 --> 01:00:21.175
Like what?

01:00:22.175 --> 01:00:23.344
I've...

01:00:24.878 --> 01:00:27.211
been seeing things. Anyway.

01:00:27.213 --> 01:00:28.482
Erm...

01:00:29.382 --> 01:00:32.385
Yes... What do you
want to talk about?

01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:35.123
Erm...

01:00:36.456 --> 01:00:39.827
I've been wanting to talk to you
for a while now.

01:00:47.099 --> 01:00:48.402
Err...

01:00:50.204 --> 01:00:51.539
Yeah?

01:00:52.472 --> 01:00:53.807
About?

01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:01.282
Alex... I like you.

01:01:03.884 --> 01:01:05.519
And that I don't...

01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:19.466
Sorry, I've been useless.

01:01:21.568 --> 01:01:25.206
I've had so much on my mind,
I feel like I'm going crazy.

01:01:30.077 --> 01:01:33.077
You're a big part of my life and
I love having you as a friend

01:01:33.079 --> 01:01:36.146
and I don't want to lose that,
I guess, that just kind of

01:01:36.148 --> 01:01:38.416
- scares me.
- But that's not gonna happen.

01:01:38.418 --> 01:01:40.988
We have and always
will be friends.

01:01:42.889 --> 01:01:45.326
- I hope not...
- Let's just see what happens.

01:01:46.326 --> 01:01:50.128
It's new. We'll just see
where it goes and then

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:52.363
if it becomes uncomfortable

01:01:52.365 --> 01:01:56.204
or anything, we'll just
go back to being friends.

01:03:32.065 --> 01:03:34.335
What the hell?

01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:40.473
OK, this is gonna sound crazy,
OK?

01:03:41.474 --> 01:03:44.075
But I swear...

01:03:44.077 --> 01:03:46.447
there is something in this room.

01:03:48.648 --> 01:03:49.951
What?

01:03:54.588 --> 01:03:57.692
There's something in this room,
There's something in this room.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.038
Yes. Thank you, please do.

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.681
Hello, Alex. I'm so glad
you came back. Please, sit down.

01:04:22.148 --> 01:04:25.385
I need to apologise about
yesterday, it just came as a shock

01:04:26.452 --> 01:04:30.023
But I understand that you couldn't
have known what would happen.

01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:34.495
Thank you, Alex.
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:04:35.762 --> 01:04:37.198
Hmm.

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.500
This is very new to me.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.802
My father only just told me
about everything.

01:04:43.804 --> 01:04:46.137
I understand.

01:04:46.139 --> 01:04:47.474
Yeah.

01:04:49.175 --> 01:04:51.309
Look, I have to be honest.

01:04:51.311 --> 01:04:53.545
OK, I wouldn't have
come back by choice.

01:04:53.547 --> 01:04:56.380
It's just that things
are getting worse.

01:04:56.382 --> 01:04:58.650
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:58.652 --> 01:05:00.420
Did something happen?

01:05:01.387 --> 01:05:03.822
I'm just seeing these shadows

01:05:03.824 --> 01:05:06.391
more and more often.

01:05:06.393 --> 01:05:09.594
It's a plague and it's
affecting those around me.

01:05:09.596 --> 01:05:12.831
And then yesterday
I saw something different.

01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:14.468
Different?

01:05:16.402 --> 01:05:20.405
- Look, I'm not crazy.
- What do you mean different?

01:05:20.407 --> 01:05:22.706
Well, it was just a different
shape from the others.

01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:25.145
It was like a human
but with the head of a ram.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.050
Alex, if this is spiritual...

01:05:29.815 --> 01:05:32.383
then I'm afraid there isn't
much more I can do for you.

01:05:32.385 --> 01:05:35.320
- No, no, you said! You said!
- I know what I said.

01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:38.392
I know what I said but things
are more complicated now.

01:05:38.824 --> 01:05:41.159
Listen, I need to do something.

01:05:41.161 --> 01:05:43.862
There's nothing I'd be able to do.
I don't know enough about it.

01:05:43.864 --> 01:05:46.132
OK, well, what the hell do I do?

01:05:47.434 --> 01:05:50.137
You need to find someone
who understands this.

01:05:54.574 --> 01:05:57.141
As a professional I've always
remained sceptical,

01:05:57.143 --> 01:05:59.776
but it would seem these
shadow people have something

01:05:59.778 --> 01:06:01.849
of an historical occurrence.

01:06:03.282 --> 01:06:05.786
I guess your attempt
at astral projection may have

01:06:06.786 --> 01:06:09.186
opened a gateway that was

01:06:09.188 --> 01:06:11.692
perhaps otherwise,
meant to stay shut.

01:06:18.664 --> 01:06:21.701
He said there was nothing
he could do.

01:06:24.471 --> 01:06:26.474
What the hell do I do now?

01:06:29.742 --> 01:06:31.744
Well, is there nothing
we can do?

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.344
What about clairvoyance?

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:06.344
How is that gonna help?

01:07:06.346 --> 01:07:09.315
Well, maybe if I can figure out
what it is.

01:07:10.483 --> 01:07:12.419
I'll know how to get rid of it.

01:07:46.719 --> 01:07:49.253
So, which if you
would like to go first?

01:07:49.255 --> 01:07:51.192
Me, I'd like to, please.

01:08:00.766 --> 01:08:04.804
First off, if you could shuffle
the cards in any way you wish.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.849
Place the pack face down
on the table.

01:08:18.652 --> 01:08:21.488
Now, if you could cut the pack
at any point you wish.

01:08:36.301 --> 01:08:38.669
I'm now going to
lift three cards,

01:08:38.671 --> 01:08:40.707
which will be relevant
only to you.

01:08:48.913 --> 01:08:51.515
I will explain the meaning
on each one as they turn

01:08:51.518 --> 01:08:53.787
and their relationship
to each other.

01:08:58.658 --> 01:08:59.993
The Hanged Man.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.428
This card signifies change,

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:07.531
sacrifice and abandonment.

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:10.500
It's about letting go
of your past

01:09:10.502 --> 01:09:13.273
to reveal a new
spiritual beginning.

01:09:20.578 --> 01:09:21.849
The Tower.

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:25.986
This card reveals
a sudden change coming.

01:09:27.554 --> 01:09:31.425
Abandonment of the past
and unexpected events.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.939
You brought something
here with you.

01:09:49.509 --> 01:09:51.843
Michelle, your book, it stated

01:09:51.845 --> 01:09:55.079
a section on banishing spirits
with a case study.

01:09:55.081 --> 01:09:57.016
I wish I'd never written it.

01:09:58.518 --> 01:10:01.451
That case study is the reason
I don't do it anymore.

01:10:01.453 --> 01:10:03.553
I need your help.

01:10:03.555 --> 01:10:05.723
Please, leave.

01:10:05.725 --> 01:10:07.959
Let's just go.
Thank you for your time.

01:10:07.961 --> 01:10:09.427
Let's go, Alex.

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:19.106
Trust me. That was not me.

01:10:21.073 --> 01:10:23.076
I need you to sit down.

01:10:25.412 --> 01:10:27.715
I've never done a reading
like this before.

01:10:28.747 --> 01:10:30.915
These cards represent

01:10:30.917 --> 01:10:33.454
a very dark change in your life.

01:10:39.426 --> 01:10:41.925
There are spirits around you
looking for a way in.

01:10:41.927 --> 01:10:43.896
You saw them?

01:10:44.797 --> 01:10:48.868
Yes, and our only choice
is to banish them.

01:10:50.203 --> 01:10:53.807
There is one,
more powerful than the others.

01:10:55.007 --> 01:10:58.010
It seeks only destruction, it won't
stop till it gets what it wants.

01:10:59.011 --> 01:11:01.745
- We need its name.
- Why?

01:11:01.747 --> 01:11:05.049
Most religions
have names for them.

01:11:05.051 --> 01:11:08.619
The Bible refers to them
as demons, spirits,

01:11:08.621 --> 01:11:11.591
and fallen angels,
although I use the term loosely.

01:11:12.658 --> 01:11:16.462
We need to find its name
to understand its weaknesses.

01:11:23.502 --> 01:11:27.473
This can't be. You can't affect
things from the astral realm.

01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:32.712
You attempted astral projection?

01:11:33.212 --> 01:11:37.581
Yeah, I only wanted to look
into that world to find my mum.

01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:39.483
Alex,

01:11:39.485 --> 01:11:41.921
your mother is not here now.

01:11:43.256 --> 01:11:45.659
But something else is.

01:11:46.059 --> 01:11:49.829
It's looking to break you down and it's
getting stronger and more powerful.

01:11:50.963 --> 01:11:53.030
It's feeding on your fear.

01:11:55.601 --> 01:11:57.970
Stay here.

01:12:00.539 --> 01:12:03.710
The Quran refer to
these spirits as Jinn,

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:07.577
a spirit from an
unseen dimension.

01:12:07.579 --> 01:12:09.546
Alex,

01:12:09.548 --> 01:12:11.648
you'll have to do
as you did before.

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:13.617
Project?

01:12:13.619 --> 01:12:15.952
- Yes.
- No.

01:12:15.954 --> 01:12:18.522
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:18.524 --> 01:12:20.693
No, that's what started this.

01:12:21.194 --> 01:12:24.698
- It's gonna make it worse.
- No, it won't.

01:12:25.131 --> 01:12:27.264
No, I can't. I...

01:12:27.266 --> 01:12:29.970
Alex, please trust me.

01:12:31.069 --> 01:12:33.206
It won't make it worse.

01:12:34.974 --> 01:12:37.144
- No.
- Alex, listen to me.

01:12:37.976 --> 01:12:39.912
Its power...

01:12:40.712 --> 01:12:43.013
Please, listen to me.
Its power...

01:12:43.015 --> 01:12:45.085
I can't, I can't.

01:12:47.886 --> 01:12:51.157
Its power is that it can
affect this world.

01:12:51.791 --> 01:12:54.728
But it is not stronger than you
in its world.

01:12:55.828 --> 01:12:59.095
You have to cross over
and demand its name.

01:12:59.097 --> 01:13:01.197
With that we can cast it out.

01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:03.800
So, we're supposed to
just sit here and watch?

01:13:03.802 --> 01:13:06.506
Yes, but we can
combine our energies.

01:13:08.307 --> 01:13:10.010
Alex?

01:13:16.849 --> 01:13:18.619
Right.

01:13:36.868 --> 01:13:37.904
Alex?

01:13:39.072 --> 01:13:41.275
I need you...

01:13:42.007 --> 01:13:43.943
to stare into the candle.

01:13:47.313 --> 01:13:48.949
It's OK.

01:13:49.983 --> 01:13:52.219
Stare into the candle.

01:13:53.653 --> 01:13:55.789
Consider your thoughts.

01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:59.592
And focus your energy...

01:13:59.993 --> 01:14:01.895
..into the flame.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.308
The light of God surrounds us,
the love of God enfolds us.

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:21.379
May the presence of God
watch over us.

01:14:21.381 --> 01:14:23.880
The power of God protects us.

01:14:23.882 --> 01:14:26.886
Wherever we are, God is,
and all is well.

01:14:33.192 --> 01:14:34.895
Let's begin.

01:14:39.666 --> 01:14:42.299
Don't believe everything
you're about to see.

01:14:42.301 --> 01:14:44.701
Follow my lead.

01:14:44.703 --> 01:14:47.039
And focus yourself
on positive thoughts.

01:14:53.011 --> 01:14:55.681
Place your finger
on the planchet.

01:15:01.854 --> 01:15:04.091
We acknowledge your presence.

01:15:05.224 --> 01:15:07.324
Tell us your name.

01:15:09.462 --> 01:15:12.833
Alex. Demand its name.

01:15:13.432 --> 01:15:14.964
Alex!

01:15:14.966 --> 01:15:16.670
It's alright.

01:15:17.436 --> 01:15:19.870
I demand you...

01:15:19.872 --> 01:15:21.908
Give us your name!

01:15:27.779 --> 01:15:29.181
A.

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:40.894
Amaymon.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.362
What is it?

01:15:43.996 --> 01:15:45.998
It's not possible, it can't...

01:15:46.832 --> 01:15:49.402
- What the hell is it?
- It's not just a spirit...

01:15:50.502 --> 01:15:53.372
Alex, end your projection!

01:15:57.176 --> 01:15:59.880
Art thou, Asmodai?

01:16:40.386 --> 01:16:42.887
- Your face.
- Don't believe it.

01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:45.054
These are tricks of the mind.

01:16:45.056 --> 01:16:46.792
Alex.

01:16:49.796 --> 01:16:52.899
Return your dark spirit to
the depths from which you came!

01:16:54.266 --> 01:16:57.034
Counter all negative thoughts
and actions

01:16:57.036 --> 01:16:59.135
that are being directed to us.

01:16:59.137 --> 01:17:02.071
Eliminate the enemy's power
to do any evil to us.

01:17:02.073 --> 01:17:04.241
In Jesus Christ's name,

01:17:04.243 --> 01:17:06.544
I pray he lives and reigns

01:17:06.546 --> 01:17:10.784
with the Father
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

01:17:11.449 --> 01:17:13.519
Alex, come back.

01:17:26.498 --> 01:17:29.368
Alex, you OK?

01:17:56.494 --> 01:17:58.064
Dad.

01:17:58.997 --> 01:18:01.134
- Alex.
- Erm.

01:18:01.567 --> 01:18:03.537
There's someone
I want you to meet.

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:06.503
Hello, Mr Harmann.

01:18:06.505 --> 01:18:08.942
- I'm Alyssa.
- Please, call me, Joel.

01:18:09.507 --> 01:18:11.811
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Come in.

01:18:22.087 --> 01:18:23.553
Wow.

01:18:23.555 --> 01:18:25.491
That's very good.

01:18:29.028 --> 01:18:30.363
Aww.

01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:32.231
Daddy.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.534
Perfect likeness.

01:18:38.037 --> 01:18:40.039
It's pretty good.

01:18:49.582 --> 01:18:51.418
You, OK?
