WEBVTT

00:06.245 --> 00:08.361
It's losing mass at an extraordinary rate.

00:08.565 --> 00:10.203
How long before it goes supernova?

00:10.325 --> 00:11.758
A hundred years, maybe two.

00:11.885 --> 00:15.400
Too bad we won't be around.
It's going to be one hell of an explosion.

00:15.525 --> 00:17.914
Speak for yourself.
I might very well be around.

00:18.405 --> 00:22.034
Can't forget Vulcan longevity, Captain.
A hundred years from now?

00:22.925 --> 00:24.802
How old would that make you?

00:25.205 --> 00:29.118
No Earth ship has ever been
within 10 light-years of a hypergiant.

00:32.244 --> 00:33.837
How much farther can we move in?

00:33.965 --> 00:36.115
Our hull temperature
is approaching 1,100 degrees.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.156
It would be unsafe to get any closer.

00:38.765 --> 00:40.721
Then we'll have to run our scans
from here.

00:40.845 --> 00:42.517
Tell Astrometrics to get going.

00:42.645 --> 00:44.522
I'm sure they're champing at the bit.

00:45.925 --> 00:48.883
We may not be able to get any closer,
but someone else has.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.154
You found a ship?

00:50.285 --> 00:52.241
Bearing 261 Mark 4.

00:53.445 --> 00:56.801
It must be at least 20,000 kilometres
farther in than we are.

00:57.765 --> 00:59.039
Let's see her.

01:00.925 --> 01:02.324
Recognise it?

01:02.845 --> 01:05.120
- No.
- Hail them.

01:07.005 --> 01:09.075
The interference is pretty heavy, sir.

01:09.365 --> 01:10.559
Then try audio.

01:13.405 --> 01:15.600
This is Captain Archer
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:15.725 --> 01:17.283
I assume you've detected us.

01:17.405 --> 01:19.919
Captain Drennik.
Where have you travelled from?

01:20.805 --> 01:22.875
The Sol System. And you?

01:23.445 --> 01:25.276
We come from a system called Vissia...

01:25.405 --> 01:27.441
more than 25 light-years from here.

01:27.885 --> 01:29.398
We saw you arrive yesterday.

01:29.525 --> 01:31.675
I assume you're here
to study the hypergiant.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.036
My species has never seen one
up close.

01:35.405 --> 01:36.679
It is quite a sight.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.593
Have you measured its rate
of nucleosynthesis?

01:41.765 --> 01:44.563
I'm afraid we haven't developed
the technology to do that.

01:44.845 --> 01:47.279
If you don't mind eliminating
the development stage...

01:47.405 --> 01:50.283
I'd be more than happy
to help you modify your sensors.

01:51.605 --> 01:52.594
Thank you.

01:54.045 --> 01:56.798
I'm not sure we have anything
to offer you in return.

01:57.245 --> 01:59.201
You could invite us to visit your ship.

01:59.325 --> 02:01.964
Meeting new species
is one of our primary goals.

02:03.285 --> 02:04.638
It's one of ours as well.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.400
We'd be honoured
to have you join us for dinner.

02:07.965 --> 02:10.638
We'll be there within the hour.
I look forward to it.

02:11.485 --> 02:13.203
It'll be nice to have a First Contact...

02:13.325 --> 02:15.600
where no one's thinking
about charging weapons.

02:17.085 --> 02:19.519
Tell Chef we're going
to have some visitors.

02:24.885 --> 02:27.445
It's been a long road

02:28.965 --> 02:31.604
Gettin' from there to here

02:32.245 --> 02:35.043
It's been a long time

02:35.765 --> 02:39.235
But my time is finally near

02:39.685 --> 02:43.075
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:43.885 --> 02:46.718
I will touch the sky

02:47.165 --> 02:50.760
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:50.885 --> 02:53.797
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:53.965 --> 02:58.322
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:58.485 --> 03:01.443
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:01.565 --> 03:05.717
I've got faith to believe

03:05.925 --> 03:08.883
I can do anything

03:09.005 --> 03:12.714
I've got strength of the soul

03:13.365 --> 03:16.277
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:16.405 --> 03:20.603
I can reach any star

03:21.965 --> 03:23.956
I've got faith

03:25.645 --> 03:28.762
I've got faith

03:29.365 --> 03:32.641
Faith of the heart

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074

03:48.845 --> 03:52.235
Trinesium can withstand temperatures
up to 18,000 degrees.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.879
We've been using it
to construct our hulls for over a century.

03:55.165 --> 03:58.157
You must be able to get down into
the photosphere of most G-Type stars.

03:59.645 --> 04:01.476
We can get even deeper
with our stratopod.

04:01.605 --> 04:03.243
It's got twice the shielding.

04:04.965 --> 04:08.241
Flying into stars is a long way off for us.

04:08.565 --> 04:09.998
Your technology will evolve.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.835
What's important
is that you're explorers.

04:13.005 --> 04:15.200
We have gone farther
than any other humans.

04:15.805 --> 04:17.523
You might enjoy going even farther.

04:17.765 --> 04:20.358
I'm taking the stratopod
into the hydrogen layer tomorrow.

04:20.485 --> 04:22.237
I'd be pleased to have you join me.

04:23.605 --> 04:24.594
I am an explorer.

04:25.325 --> 04:29.603
This is called vanilla,
and this is chocolate. Give it a try.

04:31.845 --> 04:34.643
No, wait.
You've got to eat the cherry first.

04:35.325 --> 04:37.520
- This.
- Why?

04:39.645 --> 04:40.794
You just do.

04:40.965 --> 04:42.921
- A human tradition?
- Exactly.

04:45.165 --> 04:46.917
Aren't you going to introduce me?

04:47.045 --> 04:49.718
This is Malcolm Reed,
our Armoury Officer.

04:49.845 --> 04:54.157
This is Traistana, a xenobiologist,
and Veylo is a tactical officer.

04:55.405 --> 04:56.758
Very pleased to meet you.

04:56.885 --> 04:59.479
Why don't you sit down?
The Captain did ask us to mingle.

04:59.605 --> 05:03.757
Indeed. I was just speaking
with their Chief Engineer and his wife.

05:04.165 --> 05:07.953
- Maybe you should say hello.
- See you later.

05:12.405 --> 05:14.316
I'm told you're the Chief Engineer.

05:15.005 --> 05:18.361
Commander Tucker.
Lieutenant Reed pointed you out.

05:19.685 --> 05:21.437
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

05:23.525 --> 05:26.597
- This is my wife, Calla.
- I'm glad you invited us here.

05:26.725 --> 05:28.875
- Are you enjoying your food?
- Oh, very much.

05:29.165 --> 05:31.360
I hope you get the chance
to sample our food.

05:31.485 --> 05:33.476
It's more fragrant than yours.

05:34.205 --> 05:35.320
I look forward to it.

05:35.445 --> 05:37.515
I'd also like to get a peek
at your engine room.

05:37.645 --> 05:38.839
By all means.

05:40.045 --> 05:41.922
Trip Tucker. Welcome aboard.

05:43.045 --> 05:44.080
Hello.

05:44.325 --> 05:46.634
It has no name. It's our cogenitor.

05:48.605 --> 05:49.674
"Cogenitor"?

05:50.205 --> 05:51.797
We're hoping to have a baby.

05:55.445 --> 05:57.913
Our warp core emits omicron radiation.

05:58.165 --> 06:01.396
I'd recommend you speak
with your doctor about an inoculation.

06:02.045 --> 06:03.034
Sure thing.

06:08.365 --> 06:11.914
- This should do it.
- So, you've heard of these cogenitors?

06:12.925 --> 06:14.995
Not all species are limited to two sexes.

06:15.565 --> 06:19.160
In fact, I have it on good authority...

06:19.285 --> 06:22.675
that the Rigellians have four,
or was it five?

06:23.445 --> 06:28.075
So, you're saying that this man
or woman or whatever, is a third sex?

06:30.005 --> 06:34.123
And she...
It is part of the impregnation process?

06:34.325 --> 06:35.474
Precisely.

06:36.365 --> 06:39.198
I'm pretty familiar
with how it works with two sexes, but...

06:39.325 --> 06:41.441
Multi-gendered techniques
aren't always the same.

06:41.565 --> 06:44.443
But in this case, I imagine
the cogenitor provides an enzyme...

06:44.565 --> 06:46.362
which facilitates conception.

06:47.245 --> 06:50.203
- What do you mean by "provides"?
- Well, first the female has to...

06:50.325 --> 06:52.885
No, don't tell me.
I don't think I want to know.

06:56.485 --> 06:57.964
I have pictures.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.962
I think I'll pass.

07:00.605 --> 07:03.836
How long is this going to last?
I might want to stay there for a while.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.001
It should protect you
from omicron radiation...

07:06.125 --> 07:07.763
for about 12 years.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.995
That should be enough. Thanks, Doc.

07:11.405 --> 07:13.441
Keep an open mind, Commander.

07:13.885 --> 07:16.001
You came on this mission
to meet other species...

07:16.125 --> 07:18.195
no matter how many genders
they may have.

07:36.085 --> 07:38.121
"There are more things in heaven
and Earth...

07:38.245 --> 07:40.315
"than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

07:41.485 --> 07:42.998
Where'd you hear that?

07:43.365 --> 07:45.162
Hamlet, Act One, Scene Five.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.363
Your Communications Officer
was kind enough to provide us...

07:48.485 --> 07:51.443
with some of your literature.
I assume you approved.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.114
Absolutely.

07:53.725 --> 07:56.285
But I didn't think you'd be quoting it
the next day.

07:56.405 --> 07:58.202
We retain most of what we read.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.875
And you obviously read pretty quickly.

08:01.165 --> 08:04.953
After I finished Shakespeare last night,
I began reading the plays of Sophocles.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.837
What do you recommend after that?

08:07.445 --> 08:10.039
Seems like you're picking the good ones
all by yourself.

08:12.445 --> 08:16.484
- That's got to be ionised hydrogen.
- It's generating magnetic currents.

08:16.605 --> 08:19.517
I've got friends back at home
who are not going to believe this.

08:19.645 --> 08:22.603
I have friends who will be equally
impressed with Macbeth.

08:23.245 --> 08:25.281
We're almost into the chromosphere.

08:31.045 --> 08:34.400
The antimatter stream is compressed
before the deuterium's injected...

08:34.525 --> 08:35.594
into the core.

08:35.725 --> 08:37.760
So you don't need
magnetic confinement.

08:38.725 --> 08:40.635
Let me bring up the schematics.

08:42.885 --> 08:47.197
Where we come from, Earth,
there are only two genders.

08:48.165 --> 08:49.883
That's true of most worlds.

08:50.965 --> 08:54.355
I don't mean to pry,
but does every family have a cogenitor?

08:54.885 --> 08:56.762
That wouldn't be very efficient.

08:56.925 --> 08:59.803
They're only needed
when a couple's trying to have a child.

09:01.005 --> 09:02.438
And when they're not?

09:02.885 --> 09:04.955
The cogenitor is assigned
to another couple.

09:05.885 --> 09:08.524
They make up about 3%
of our population...

09:08.645 --> 09:11.239
which seems to be a perfect ratio.

09:12.245 --> 09:14.600
Nature has a way of finding
the right balance.

09:16.005 --> 09:18.360
Is the one I met
the only one on your ship?

09:18.485 --> 09:21.397
The only one.
Once Calla and I are finished with it...

09:21.525 --> 09:23.880
I doubt it'll be needed
before we return home.

09:25.485 --> 09:28.363
Would you like to take a closer look at
the plasma converters?

09:28.485 --> 09:29.679
I would. Thanks.

09:34.245 --> 09:37.123
So, does it live with you and your wife?

09:37.685 --> 09:39.323
We keep it in our quarters, yes.

09:40.645 --> 09:42.681
What does it do when you're not...

09:44.405 --> 09:46.965
It eats, sleeps...

09:47.805 --> 09:49.716
there's not much else for it to do.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.353
What about school?

09:52.485 --> 09:54.316
They only serve one purpose.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.955
Sending them to school
would make no sense.

09:57.485 --> 10:00.397
Why are you so curious about them?

10:02.285 --> 10:03.718
Humans are very curious.

10:07.365 --> 10:10.038
You might find this hard to believe,
but this polymer...

10:10.165 --> 10:13.441
is composed of over 200
naturally occurring elements.

10:14.525 --> 10:15.594
That's impossible.

10:15.725 --> 10:18.717
I read in your database
that you've discovered only 92.

10:19.565 --> 10:22.125
I understand
how this might seem unnerving.

10:23.445 --> 10:27.233
A lot of things around here do.
But I'm trying to keep an open mind.

10:34.605 --> 10:37.073
- How long will you be gone?
- Close to three days.

10:38.165 --> 10:40.599
The circumference
is nearly a billion kilometres.

10:40.725 --> 10:42.317
We'll be scanning surface features...

10:42.445 --> 10:44.401
that are undetectable
from higher altitudes.

10:44.525 --> 10:47.517
Three days is a long time
to be confined to such a small craft...

10:47.965 --> 10:49.956
especially with a person you've just met.

10:50.125 --> 10:51.638
I think I'll survive.

10:51.765 --> 10:55.121
These people are fascinating, T'Pol.
They have a lot to offer us.

10:55.565 --> 10:58.637
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful relationship.

10:58.765 --> 11:01.837
Which reminds me,
they've asked us for a sampling of films.

11:02.005 --> 11:04.883
- I've put together a few suggestions.
- I'll see to it.

11:05.285 --> 11:07.799
- You're in charge.
- Of the ship, or the movies?

11:18.605 --> 11:19.594
Commander.

11:22.365 --> 11:23.400
Captain left yet?

11:23.885 --> 11:25.523
He'll be gone for three days.

11:27.285 --> 11:29.003
He asked
that you download these films...

11:29.125 --> 11:31.593
and transfer them
to the Vissians' database.

11:34.045 --> 11:35.876
- Did you meet their engineer?
- Briefly.

11:36.285 --> 11:38.480
He and his wife
are trying to have a baby.

11:38.845 --> 11:40.244
How interesting.

11:40.565 --> 11:43.557
There was someone else with them.
They called her a "cogenitor."

11:43.805 --> 11:44.794
You know what that is?

11:44.925 --> 11:47.075
A third gender. Why do you call it "her"?

11:47.325 --> 11:49.555
She looks more like a her than a him.

11:50.925 --> 11:52.677
They treat her like a pet...

11:52.805 --> 11:55.524
kept in her room,
not taught to read or write, no name.

11:56.805 --> 11:57.874
Porthos has a name.

11:58.005 --> 12:00.439
We shouldn't judge the customs
of other cultures.

12:00.565 --> 12:03.875
It's not about taking your shoes off
when you walk into someone's house.

12:04.005 --> 12:06.235
The cogenitor's treated
like one of Phlox's leeches.

12:06.365 --> 12:09.118
You pull it out when you need it,
then you throw it back in.

12:09.245 --> 12:11.395
Tri-gender reproduction
is not uncommon.

12:12.085 --> 12:16.522
That's not what I'm talking about.
This is a question of human rights.

12:16.805 --> 12:18.033
They're not human.

12:19.525 --> 12:22.278
Captain Archer hopes to develop
a productive relationship...

12:22.405 --> 12:23.633
with this species.

12:23.845 --> 12:26.518
It might be best
if you kept your opinions to yourself.

12:28.845 --> 12:32.724
It's good advice.
Mating habits are often quite personal.

12:33.885 --> 12:36.160
Some species aren't comfortable
discussing them.

12:36.765 --> 12:38.960
I'm not interested
in discussing their habits.

12:39.485 --> 12:41.840
I'm concerned with the way
they treat this cogenitor.

12:41.965 --> 12:45.878
- They're most likely one and the same.
- Yeah, well, that doesn't make it right.

12:46.005 --> 12:47.961
It's not a question of right or wrong.

12:49.525 --> 12:51.243
You scanned them
when they came on board.

12:51.365 --> 12:52.684
Don't you always do that?

12:52.805 --> 12:56.195
They weren't carrying any pathogens
that would be dangerous to our crew.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.403
Can you tell me about
the mental capacity of this cogenitor?

12:59.525 --> 13:01.914
Is it any different than the males
and females?

13:02.965 --> 13:05.479
I'm afraid I didn't take any neural scans.

13:07.045 --> 13:10.958
- Is that something I could do?
- Why would you want to?

13:12.245 --> 13:15.237
- Just curious.
- I suppose you could.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.434
Fruit and cheese often complement
each other.

13:21.605 --> 13:23.835
So cheese comes in eight varieties?

13:24.205 --> 13:26.958
Well, actually, there are hundreds,
maybe thousands.

13:27.085 --> 13:28.279
What made you choose these?

13:28.405 --> 13:31.124
They have the strongest smells
of anything we have on board.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.122
You said our food
was aromatically bland...

13:33.245 --> 13:35.600
and I thought
this might change your mind.

13:35.925 --> 13:37.040
Try some.

13:41.245 --> 13:43.679
Mild, but very nice.

13:45.205 --> 13:49.278
How about this one?

13:52.965 --> 13:55.638
The odour's a little spicier.
What's it called?

13:55.925 --> 13:58.485
Stilton. Chef says it's pretty pungent.

13:58.685 --> 14:01.358
- Haven't you ever tried it?
- Not for a long time.

14:02.725 --> 14:03.794
Here.

14:05.405 --> 14:07.600
I'd say that's more than a little spicy.

14:13.045 --> 14:15.878
- And what's this called?
- Alsatian Muenster.

14:19.565 --> 14:20.554
Interesting.

14:23.245 --> 14:26.920
- Don't you find it sensual?
- Very.

14:36.085 --> 14:40.283
Can we visit the Armoury later?
I'm anxious to see your tactical array.

14:41.885 --> 14:43.841
There's an old Earth expression:

14:44.765 --> 14:48.724
"I'll show you mine
if you show me yours."

14:55.245 --> 14:58.362
Your father. That's hard to imagine.

14:58.485 --> 14:59.964
The men who developed Warp drive...

15:00.085 --> 15:02.394
on my world lived nearly
a thousand years ago.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.404
I'm surprised
your ancestors never made it to Earth.

15:06.525 --> 15:08.880
We don't believe
in travelling great distances.

15:09.005 --> 15:11.155
There's far too much to see
close to home.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.834
Well, maybe now you have
a reason to visit us. It's not that far.

15:14.965 --> 15:18.435
I'm sure we can make an exception.
I'm going to take us down to the edge...

15:18.565 --> 15:20.920
of the photosphere.
It might get a little turbulent.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.160
Fine with me.

15:24.725 --> 15:28.513
When the engine reaches critical mass,
a mixture of positrons and neutrinos...

15:28.645 --> 15:30.636
is injected into the chamber.

15:31.205 --> 15:32.320
Watch.

15:35.405 --> 15:39.000
The efficiency's up over 30%.
Pretty impressive.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.995
It's possible this technology
could be modified for Enterprise.

15:44.245 --> 15:45.598
We'd be very grateful.

15:47.885 --> 15:50.194
We don't have any married couples
on Enterprise.

15:50.645 --> 15:54.558
- Do they give you special quarters?
- The Captain's very generous.

15:54.805 --> 15:58.593
I wish ours was. I've got a room
not half the size of this one.

15:58.965 --> 16:01.160
I'd love to get a look
at your quarters some time.

16:01.285 --> 16:03.037
If I could describe it to Captain Archer...

16:03.165 --> 16:05.474
he might consider expanding
my living space.

16:05.645 --> 16:09.354
Why don't you join us for dinner tonight?
You did agree to try our food.

16:09.725 --> 16:11.556
Are you telling me
you have a dining room?

16:11.685 --> 16:14.836
We'll try not to prepare anything
too pungent.

16:30.925 --> 16:33.997
It's pretty mild, considering the smell.

16:34.405 --> 16:37.124
For us, the aroma
is far more important than the taste.

16:38.285 --> 16:40.037
This must have taken you all day.

16:40.685 --> 16:44.234
If I had all day, I would have prepared
a far more scented meal.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.081
Calla's in charge of
the Microgravity Lab.

16:47.245 --> 16:49.475
We usually don't have much time
for cooking.

16:50.445 --> 16:52.163
Will your cogenitor be joining us?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.040
It rarely eats more than one meal a day.

16:55.845 --> 16:58.200
So, in our mess hall...

16:58.485 --> 17:01.283
Bringing the cogenitor
to your ship was an exception.

17:01.805 --> 17:04.272
Too bad. I was hoping to say hello.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.198
Why would you want to do that?

17:06.724 --> 17:09.922
Commander Tucker is very curious
about our reproductive process.

17:10.365 --> 17:11.923
Humans are bi-gendered.

17:13.685 --> 17:15.164
I'll see if it's awake.

17:20.365 --> 17:21.877
Which one's the cogenitor?

17:23.285 --> 17:24.273
Right here.

17:24.685 --> 17:28.233
Her synaptic density and neural mass
are almost identical to the other two.

17:29.445 --> 17:32.243
Your cogenitor appears to be
no more or less intelligent...

17:32.365 --> 17:34.117
than the male and female.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.995
I wouldn't mind taking
a turn at the helm.

17:40.965 --> 17:42.921
Our navigation controls
are not like yours.

17:43.045 --> 17:45.081
They're based on five spatial axes.

17:45.925 --> 17:48.485
I've been watching you.
I think I can handle it.

18:04.325 --> 18:06.964
- You obviously have some experience.
- A little.

18:11.685 --> 18:13.835
There's a pretty big flare
forming below us.

18:14.485 --> 18:17.079
I think I can loop around it,
let you get a better scan.

18:17.325 --> 18:19.475
It's giving off a lot of magnetic flux.

18:19.605 --> 18:22.563
It may cause false readings
in the navigation sensors.

18:22.725 --> 18:24.443
I'll keep an eye on it.

18:30.125 --> 18:34.038
So, by rotating the quantum inverters,
you've tripled the antimatter flux?

18:34.165 --> 18:37.794
Exactly. Three more, and I'll be finished.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.162
I haven't eaten anything
since this morning.

18:41.285 --> 18:43.321
If you don't mind,
I'll go to your mess hall...

18:43.445 --> 18:44.764
see what they're serving.

18:45.205 --> 18:47.435
If you wait until I'm done,
I'll show you the way.

18:47.565 --> 18:49.760
I'll be all right.
I'm sure I can find the way.

18:50.245 --> 18:51.917
See you in a little while?

19:09.005 --> 19:11.280
- They're not here.
- I came to see you.

19:13.205 --> 19:14.274
Why?

19:15.245 --> 19:18.601
I brought you this.
It'll teach you how to read.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.674
- Now you try it.
- I don't understand.

19:28.325 --> 19:31.317
You just touch the word,
then you'll hear it pronounced.

19:31.445 --> 19:32.844
Go ahead, try it.

19:36.445 --> 19:39.403
- Today.
- That's right. Now, go to the next one.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.840
Today we're...

19:41.965 --> 19:43.193
Good. Again.

19:43.325 --> 19:46.044
Why are you doing this?
It's not right for me to read.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.953
- Who told you that?
- You shouldn't be here.

19:56.365 --> 19:59.516
You're as capable as they are.
As smart as they are.

20:00.085 --> 20:02.315
That's not true.
They need me to have children.

20:02.605 --> 20:06.757
It's not a question of what they need.
You have the same rights, to learn...

20:07.165 --> 20:10.760
to choose how you're going to live,
to have a name.

20:11.325 --> 20:13.714
That may be true on your world,
but not on mine.

20:15.085 --> 20:17.599
When Calla gives birth,
who's going to raise the baby?

20:17.725 --> 20:19.955
- Who's going to take care of it?
- They will.

20:20.445 --> 20:22.242
Why? You're just as crucial...

20:22.365 --> 20:24.117
in creating the child as they are.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.958
You don't understand.

20:27.605 --> 20:29.038
Okay, maybe.

20:30.565 --> 20:31.839
But we took scans.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.794
My doctor says
you have the same potential as they do.

20:34.925 --> 20:37.485
The only thing that sets you apart
is your gender.

20:37.925 --> 20:40.678
You're no more different
than they are from each other.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.520
Haven't you ever wished
you could read?

20:44.765 --> 20:48.201
It won't hurt you, you know.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

21:11.245 --> 21:15.363
Today we're going...
Today we're going to...

21:17.245 --> 21:19.076
Today we're going to read.

21:24.405 --> 21:26.396
I'm starting to get the hang of this.

21:27.365 --> 21:29.515
I can take us down a little closer
if you'd like.

21:29.645 --> 21:31.795
Another 10,000 metres and I can get...

21:31.925 --> 21:33.517
a particle count of the photosphere.

21:33.645 --> 21:36.717
Aye, aye, Captain.
Ten thousand metres it is.

21:47.125 --> 21:49.685
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely.

21:49.845 --> 21:52.837
If you can keep us at this altitude
a little while longer.

21:53.325 --> 21:54.519
No problem.

21:58.845 --> 22:01.040
Are these armed
with photonic warheads?

22:01.205 --> 22:04.277
Photonic? I'm not familiar with that.

22:04.885 --> 22:08.434
I'm afraid our weapons are somewhat
more sophisticated than yours.

22:08.725 --> 22:12.195
This technology must seem
pretty antiquated to you.

22:12.805 --> 22:15.797
Where I come from,
antiquated can be very quaint.

22:16.445 --> 22:20.802
- Is that how you see us? Quaint?
- And charming.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.081
What sort of power source
do these use?

22:25.725 --> 22:30.560
Sarium micro-cells.
I suppose that's very quaint, too.

22:31.405 --> 22:34.397
Not at all.
We charge our weapons the same way.

22:36.965 --> 22:39.604
Well, maybe you'd like
to see the phase-cannon assembly.

22:39.725 --> 22:40.760
Please.

22:48.365 --> 22:49.514
After you.

22:55.965 --> 22:57.796
It has multiphasic emitters...

22:58.885 --> 23:01.718
and a maximum yield of 80 gigajoules.

23:01.845 --> 23:02.834
Impressive.

23:03.365 --> 23:04.764
I'm sorry it's so cramped in here.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.922
Don't be. I've wanted to get
a little closer to you all day.

23:08.765 --> 23:09.800
Really?

23:09.925 --> 23:12.314
I was hoping
to spend some intimate time with you.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.436
Maybe we could sleep together tonight.

23:17.845 --> 23:22.236
On Earth, it's customary to ask
a woman to dinner first...

23:23.645 --> 23:25.442
before spending the night with her.

23:25.925 --> 23:27.722
It's very different on Vissia.

23:27.845 --> 23:30.962
It's only when a woman
enjoys her intimate time with a man...

23:31.085 --> 23:32.677
that she'll join him for dinner.

23:33.525 --> 23:36.244
"The Didiron Mountain Range
runs through the upper plains...

23:36.365 --> 23:37.593
"of the Great Continent."

23:37.725 --> 23:38.714
Amazing.

23:39.325 --> 23:41.316
The text describes
far more impressive peaks.

23:41.445 --> 23:43.879
I don't mean the mountains,
I mean your reading.

23:45.605 --> 23:49.484
"The fauna and flora vary greatly
on either side of the central plateau."

23:49.965 --> 23:52.115
Look how much you've accomplished
in a single day.

23:52.245 --> 23:54.076
And reading is just the tip
of the iceberg.

23:54.205 --> 23:56.116
You could study all sorts of things.

23:56.445 --> 23:59.960
History, science. Engineering's not bad.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.960
You don't have to
sit in this room all day.

24:03.085 --> 24:05.201
They would never
let me learn those things.

24:05.325 --> 24:06.997
Then you've got to convince them.

24:07.165 --> 24:10.202
It's not just learning,
it's experiencing things.

24:10.325 --> 24:14.523
Music, swimming in the ocean.
You do have oceans on your planet?

24:14.805 --> 24:15.794
Yes.

24:15.925 --> 24:17.438
And how about those
Didiron Mountains?

24:17.565 --> 24:19.476
Reading about them is one thing...

24:19.765 --> 24:21.278
climbing them is another.

24:21.405 --> 24:22.997
I'd like to climb a mountain.

24:23.125 --> 24:26.640
There you go. That's the right attitude.

24:29.565 --> 24:30.918
You keep at it.

24:31.485 --> 24:34.443
I've got to get back.
They think I'm at the Astrometrics Lab.

24:35.005 --> 24:36.996
But I'll see you as soon as I can.

24:41.445 --> 24:43.163
- Trip?
- Yeah?

24:44.325 --> 24:47.044
I'd like my name to be Trip,
just like yours.

24:49.005 --> 24:50.643
Actually, my name is Charles.

24:52.245 --> 24:54.281
Then I would like my name
to be Charles.

24:55.965 --> 24:57.114
I'm flattered.

25:06.685 --> 25:08.801
There's a flare forming ahead.

25:10.405 --> 25:11.394
I don't see it.

25:11.725 --> 25:14.717
You will.
Turn the axis 40 degrees to port.

25:14.845 --> 25:16.358
I think we can bank around it.

25:24.045 --> 25:26.764
- It's too big!
- Take us up! Try to get over it.

25:31.925 --> 25:34.120
- We're not going to make it.
- Increase speed!

25:35.685 --> 25:36.959
It won't be enough.

25:41.485 --> 25:42.554
What are you doing?

25:42.685 --> 25:46.360
If you can't get over a wave,
you got to dive through it.

25:59.445 --> 26:01.037
Where did you learn to do that?

26:01.645 --> 26:04.205
North shore of Oahu, body surfing.

26:05.645 --> 26:07.761
I think it's time you took the helm back.

26:18.605 --> 26:21.483
Would you be punished if they find out
you've brought me here?

26:21.605 --> 26:24.358
Punished? No.
But they might get a little angry.

26:25.285 --> 26:26.843
I would be punished.

26:27.645 --> 26:30.398
- Maybe I should take you back.
- No, I want to see more.

26:31.085 --> 26:33.838
Okay. We'll just have to be sure
no one spots us.

26:36.965 --> 26:38.603
This is our transporter.

26:42.605 --> 26:44.357
It turns things into a matter stream...

26:44.485 --> 26:47.795
that can be sent almost anywhere,
within 2,000 kilometres or so.

26:47.965 --> 26:50.195
Then it gets reassembled.

26:50.605 --> 26:52.994
- Could it send a Vissian?
- I don't see why not.

26:53.285 --> 26:56.516
- I'd like to try.
- I don't think that would be a good idea.

26:58.805 --> 27:01.638
- Could I see where you work?
- Sure. Follow me.

27:11.765 --> 27:12.914
Coast is clear.

27:24.645 --> 27:27.796
That's our main engine,
fastest one in Starfleet.

27:28.725 --> 27:30.477
I've had it up to warp 5.1.

27:30.885 --> 27:33.843
I think my ship has something like this,
but I've never seen it.

27:34.885 --> 27:35.874
Your ship has an engine...

27:36.005 --> 27:38.075
that's a lot more sophisticated
than this one.

27:39.005 --> 27:43.123
- Do you live here?
- No. My quarters are on B-Deck.

27:46.925 --> 27:48.278
Have you ever seen a movie?

27:50.805 --> 27:52.079
It's not easy picking a movie...

27:52.205 --> 27:54.639
for somebody
who's never seen one before.

27:56.285 --> 28:00.198
What would you think about a Western?
No, not a Western.

28:02.405 --> 28:05.158
I don't think
a musical would be right, either.

28:06.765 --> 28:07.959
Got it!

28:08.085 --> 28:09.677
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

28:09.805 --> 28:12.444
Nothing like a little science fiction
to break you in.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.521
It's a story about your planet?

28:14.645 --> 28:18.240
Yeah, but it's fiction.
The Earth never really stood still.

28:19.005 --> 28:22.520
Sit down. You're going to love this.

28:35.605 --> 28:38.483
Why were the humans so afraid
of Klaatu and his android?

28:39.725 --> 28:41.795
Before we made First Contact
with the Vulcans...

28:41.925 --> 28:43.404
the people of Earth were violent.

28:43.525 --> 28:46.198
They couldn't trust things
they didn't understand.

28:46.365 --> 28:48.879
The characters in the film
knew nothing about Klaatu.

28:49.005 --> 28:50.836
Who he was, where he came from.

28:50.965 --> 28:53.001
So, they tried to kill him.

28:53.885 --> 28:55.079
I understand.

29:02.045 --> 29:03.558
Does this mean I've won?

29:06.885 --> 29:09.604
No one's beaten me at this
in the last two years.

29:10.605 --> 29:13.483
Tell me about Westerns.
Maybe I could watch a Western next.

29:14.845 --> 29:16.119
It's getting late.

29:16.405 --> 29:19.283
We'd better get you back
before they realise you're gone.

29:21.285 --> 29:25.244
I've been told you're no longer welcome
aboard the Vissian ship. Why?

29:25.485 --> 29:27.077
I wasn't where I was supposed to be.

29:27.205 --> 29:30.993
No, you weren't. You told them
you were going to the Astrometrics Lab.

29:31.205 --> 29:33.514
They tried to contact you,
but you weren't there.

29:36.445 --> 29:38.117
- I was with the cogenitor.
- Where?

29:38.605 --> 29:42.518
At first, in her quarters.
Actually, they're not her quarters.

29:42.885 --> 29:45.080
They belong to the Chief Engineer
and his wife.

29:45.205 --> 29:46.320
She gets a room to sleep in.

29:46.445 --> 29:49.721
And if she's real good,
she can use their living space.

29:50.085 --> 29:53.236
- Why were you there?
- I'm teaching her how to read.

29:54.445 --> 29:57.960
- Her education is not your concern.
- What education?

29:58.805 --> 30:00.284
Where else did you go?

30:01.245 --> 30:04.681
I brought her here, gave her a little tour,
showed her a movie.

30:05.925 --> 30:07.881
It appears you're doing everything
you can...

30:08.005 --> 30:09.597
to undermine the Captain's wishes.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.602
One day, that's all it took her.

30:12.085 --> 30:14.918
In one day
she was reading a geography text.

30:15.285 --> 30:17.879
First Contacts
are important to the Captain.

30:20.405 --> 30:23.477
You may very well have
damaged this one irreparably.

30:24.685 --> 30:26.994
You're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

30:44.005 --> 30:45.518
I didn't see you.

30:46.725 --> 30:48.602
How are you doing? You all right?

30:49.405 --> 30:53.034
They don't want to help me.
They don't want me to climb mountains.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.404
Don't worry, they will. Give it time.

30:56.885 --> 30:57.954
They're angry with you.

30:58.085 --> 31:00.394
They'll leave
as soon as our captain returns.

31:01.805 --> 31:04.763
They won't help me, but you can.

31:05.885 --> 31:07.637
I want to stay here, please.

31:20.525 --> 31:22.641
- Archer to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

31:23.325 --> 31:27.443
That was one hell of a ride.
I'll tell you about it in a couple of hours.

31:27.725 --> 31:30.398
We've got a lot of data to download
into their computers.

31:30.525 --> 31:33.358
I think it would be best
if you come back immediately, sir.

31:33.485 --> 31:34.964
There's been an incident.

31:48.285 --> 31:52.244
- Where is she?
- It's not exactly a "she," sir.

31:52.565 --> 31:54.601
- Where?
- In my quarters.

31:56.405 --> 32:00.114
- How long ago did this happen?
- Last night, after supper.

32:00.605 --> 32:02.755
They demanded
that she be returned immediately.

32:02.885 --> 32:05.922
I did exactly what you'd do.
It's not like I had much choice.

32:06.045 --> 32:07.194
I wasn't going to...

32:07.325 --> 32:09.202
Would you excuse us,
Sub-Commander?

32:17.445 --> 32:19.401
I might have expected
something like this...

32:19.525 --> 32:22.915
from a first-year recruit, but not you.

32:23.925 --> 32:25.836
You did exactly what I'd do?

32:29.085 --> 32:31.315
If that's true,
then I've done a pretty lousy job...

32:31.445 --> 32:33.242
setting an example around here.

32:35.965 --> 32:37.876
You're a senior officer on this ship.

32:38.245 --> 32:40.964
You're privy to the moral challenges
I've had to face.

32:41.525 --> 32:43.561
You know I've wrestled
with the fine line...

32:43.685 --> 32:47.598
between doing what I think is right,
and interfering with other species.

32:47.725 --> 32:49.681
Don't tell me you know
what I would've done...

32:49.805 --> 32:51.443
when I don't know what I would've done!

32:51.565 --> 32:54.318
I didn't think it would hurt
to teach her how to read.

32:54.445 --> 32:57.755
Then you didn't think hard enough.
We're out here to meet new species...

32:57.885 --> 32:59.000
not tell them what to do.

32:59.125 --> 33:02.481
Teaching her to read isn't different
than you giving them books or movies.

33:02.605 --> 33:07.520
Giving them books is a lot different
than suggesting they defy their culture.

33:09.405 --> 33:11.555
And they asked me for the books.

33:13.405 --> 33:15.680
Did she ask you
to teach her how to read?

33:17.005 --> 33:18.199
No, sir.

33:20.165 --> 33:24.158
And sneaking into her quarters,
bringing her on Enterprise...

33:24.285 --> 33:26.674
lying about where you were going. Why?

33:31.845 --> 33:32.834
Come with me.

33:36.005 --> 33:40.237
- You don't understand. I can't go back.
- Just until we resolve this.

33:41.805 --> 33:44.114
Trip said I have the same rights
as they do.

33:46.005 --> 33:48.599
It's not our place
to tell you what rights you have.

33:50.765 --> 33:52.039
I'm sorry.

33:52.645 --> 33:54.556
Are you going to force me to leave?

33:57.965 --> 33:59.796
Some men can work together
for years...

33:59.925 --> 34:03.713
without creating the friendship and bond
that we did in only two days.

34:03.845 --> 34:05.597
I'm certain we can resolve this.

34:05.725 --> 34:07.841
I'm afraid it may not be that simple.

34:08.525 --> 34:11.437
On my world,
when someone asks for asylum...

34:11.565 --> 34:13.954
it has to be given serious consideration.

34:14.085 --> 34:15.598
We're not on your world...

34:15.725 --> 34:18.239
and I doubt
whether this person truly understood...

34:18.364 --> 34:20.161
what your engineer was suggesting.

34:20.804 --> 34:24.797
I've been told this "person"
is just as capable of understanding...

34:24.925 --> 34:26.324
as any of you are.

34:26.445 --> 34:28.242
Why are we debating this?

34:29.804 --> 34:31.681
The cogenitor belongs on our ship.

34:32.125 --> 34:35.400
Or are you suggesting my wife and I
abandon our plans to have a child?

34:37.764 --> 34:39.801
I've been asked to give sanctuary
to someone...

34:39.925 --> 34:42.234
who believes
she's been treated unfairly.

34:43.005 --> 34:44.358
I can't ignore that.

34:44.605 --> 34:46.596
We're the ones being treated unfairly.

34:47.245 --> 34:49.998
Do you know how long we've waited
to be given a cogenitor?

34:50.525 --> 34:51.639
"Given"?

34:52.284 --> 34:55.004
You sound like you're talking about
some inanimate object.

34:55.125 --> 34:58.754
You have no right to judge us.
You know nothing about our culture.

34:59.085 --> 35:00.643
What if one of your stewards...

35:00.765 --> 35:02.801
the men who are forced
to serve you food...

35:02.925 --> 35:04.916
what if they should ask us for asylum?

35:05.045 --> 35:06.876
They're not forced to do anything.

35:07.525 --> 35:11.200
I apologise. But it's easy
to misunderstand someone...

35:11.365 --> 35:13.560
when you know nothing
about their culture.

35:17.565 --> 35:21.399
You can't expect me to ignore someone
when they ask for my protection.

35:23.845 --> 35:26.882
We're in no rush to leave.
Take your time.

35:30.205 --> 35:32.036
Consider what we've said.

35:50.965 --> 35:54.037
You shouldn't have misgivings.
You've made the right choice.

36:06.325 --> 36:07.314
Come in.

36:30.405 --> 36:31.599
Captain Archer.

36:31.805 --> 36:34.239
I'm afraid Shakespeare
only wrote 36 plays.

36:35.125 --> 36:37.798
It might be best
if you take your time memorising them.

36:37.925 --> 36:39.040
By all means.

36:40.045 --> 36:42.957
I hope yesterday's
unfortunate incident...

36:43.085 --> 36:45.883
won't interfere with future relations
between our people.

36:46.445 --> 36:49.357
You sure you don't have
an extra stratopod you could spare?

36:50.125 --> 36:53.003
I'm sure your Starfleet
will develop one soon enough.

36:54.605 --> 36:56.914
- Goodbye, Captain.
- Safe journey.

37:04.645 --> 37:06.601
Time to say goodbye to the hypergiant.

37:10.765 --> 37:12.642
Prepare to get underway, Travis.

37:27.685 --> 37:28.674
Go ahead.

37:28.805 --> 37:31.239
There's a call coming in
from the Vissian captain, sir.

37:31.365 --> 37:32.593
He sounds upset.

37:34.245 --> 37:35.360
Put him through.

37:44.885 --> 37:45.874
Come in.

37:51.205 --> 37:52.797
You wanted to see me, Captain?

37:54.365 --> 37:57.198
I was just told
that the Vissian cogenitor died.

37:59.725 --> 38:02.319
What? How?

38:03.685 --> 38:04.879
Suicide, Trip.

38:10.565 --> 38:11.884
She killed herself.

38:15.525 --> 38:17.322
That can't be. Why?

38:22.045 --> 38:23.603
It's my fault. I'm responsible.

38:23.725 --> 38:25.397
You're damn right you are.

38:26.925 --> 38:28.677
And it's not just her.

38:29.285 --> 38:32.402
There's a child who won't be conceived
because of this...

38:32.525 --> 38:34.322
at least not for a long while.

38:35.245 --> 38:38.442
It's time you learn
to weigh the possible repercussions...

38:38.565 --> 38:40.078
of your actions.

38:40.725 --> 38:42.397
You've always been impulsive.

38:44.325 --> 38:46.043
Maybe this will teach you a lesson.

38:48.165 --> 38:49.200
I understand.

38:50.085 --> 38:51.200
Do you?

38:52.805 --> 38:54.443
I'm not so sure you do.

38:56.485 --> 39:00.524
You knew you had no business
interfering with those people.

39:00.765 --> 39:02.721
But you just couldn't let it alone.

39:04.285 --> 39:06.753
You thought
you were doing the right thing.

39:07.725 --> 39:12.276
I might agree
if this was Florida, or Singapore.

39:14.445 --> 39:16.117
But it's not, is it?

39:17.365 --> 39:19.879
We're in deep space
and a person is dead.

39:20.805 --> 39:24.241
A person who'd still be alive
if we hadn't made First Contact.

39:25.165 --> 39:28.316
I guess I haven't been very successful
at getting through to you.

39:30.205 --> 39:31.558
If I had...

39:32.045 --> 39:35.242
you would have thought a lot harder
before doing what you did.

39:37.925 --> 39:39.404
You're not responsible.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.154
Dismissed.

39:50.205 --> 39:51.194
Captain?
