WEBVTT

00:13.365 --> 00:17.565
Unprofessional behaviour,
damage to the reputation of the firm,

00:17.645 --> 00:20.485
using the public forum
of the Lawyer Of The Year Awards

00:20.565 --> 00:24.325
to call your colleagues
"a shower of shithouses".

00:24.405 --> 00:26.005
Innocent office banter.

00:26.085 --> 00:30.325
-And he stole my yoghurt from the fridge.
-I didn't touch your fucking yoghurt.

00:30.405 --> 00:34.045
I move that we suspend Ken Thompson
from the firm for a period of one month.

00:35.685 --> 00:37.205
All in favour of suspension?

00:38.885 --> 00:40.925
Three. All against?

00:42.165 --> 00:44.685
-[gentle snoring]
-Er...

00:45.805 --> 00:47.885
So, two, three...

00:47.965 --> 00:49.645
I make that four!

00:49.725 --> 00:52.685
-Oh, well, thanks, everyone. I must say--
-What's going on?

00:53.405 --> 00:55.925
-What are you doing to my arm, Ken?
-Shit it!

00:57.445 --> 00:59.885
All right. I'll go.

01:00.445 --> 01:02.125
See you all in a month.

01:07.365 --> 01:10.885
Oh, and Adrian,
I did steal your yoghurt.

01:10.965 --> 01:13.485
A stole it, and I ate it,

01:13.565 --> 01:15.125
and I loved it.

01:16.165 --> 01:17.245
[door slams]

01:23.725 --> 01:26.085
-Your morning coffee, Rachel.
-Oh.

01:27.725 --> 01:29.365
Ah. Argh!

01:29.445 --> 01:30.845
[crying out]

01:31.445 --> 01:33.325
Agh! I'm good.

01:33.405 --> 01:35.645
-In a mug's fine.
-But I need the practice.

01:35.725 --> 01:39.005
You have to know how to mix a cocktail
when you're co-owner of a cocktail bar.

01:39.085 --> 01:40.845
-Can we talk about the bar?
-Yes.

01:40.925 --> 01:44.005
And I know exactly
what you're going to say, and I agree.

01:44.085 --> 01:46.085
Opening this bar with Steve
<i>was</i> a great idea.

01:46.165 --> 01:49.525
Not what I was going to say.
Dale, it's a terrible idea.

01:49.605 --> 01:51.245
It's the worst idea
anyone in this house has ever had,

01:51.325 --> 01:52.565
and I'm including Dylan.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.965
Uh, excuse me,
what terrible ideas have I ever had?

01:55.045 --> 01:56.605
Uh, hello, hand job at a funeral?

01:57.605 --> 02:00.205
-Fair enough.
-I know what will put your mind at rest.

02:00.285 --> 02:01.365
-Calling Steve?
-No.

02:01.445 --> 02:02.845
-Getting your money back?
-Mm-mm.

02:02.925 --> 02:05.405
Going back in time and not investing your
savings into a Lichfield cocktail bar?

02:05.485 --> 02:08.365
No. I'm going to take you by the site,
show you the magic.

02:08.445 --> 02:11.445
Once you see All Steve's Pals,
you'll get it.

02:15.165 --> 02:19.085
Lorna, any reason why our son
is dressed as a girl?

02:19.165 --> 02:20.925
It's what he wanted to wear.

02:21.005 --> 02:25.405
-I know, but come on, look at him.
-Ken, you are such a dinosaur.

02:26.005 --> 02:29.325
Children's clothes, their toys,
they're all gender-neutral now.

02:29.405 --> 02:31.885
I know, and that's broadly great,
but, I mean...

02:31.965 --> 02:34.045
Come on, Dylan,
you're with me on this, right?

02:34.125 --> 02:37.285
Actually, Dad, society's moved on
since the Dark Ages.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.845
This thing called political
correctness happened.

02:39.925 --> 02:42.045
You might want to look it up,
you big fat bender.

02:42.125 --> 02:45.565
Right. OK, I haven't got time for this.
If you would.

02:45.645 --> 02:48.325
Do not forget,
the interview for the nursery's at one.

02:48.405 --> 02:50.925
-[sighs] Do I have to come?
-Yes, Ken.

02:51.005 --> 02:54.045
This nursery is the dog's doodah
of nurseries.

02:54.125 --> 02:56.285
There's a waiting list
to get on the waiting list.

02:56.365 --> 02:58.605
They bake bread every day, Ken.

02:58.685 --> 03:01.125
They learn French, don't they, sweetheart?
French, Ken!

03:01.205 --> 03:04.565
Good, because I've been worried sick
about Sid's conversational vocab.

03:04.645 --> 03:09.125
-If Jane doesn't let you out for this--
-It's fine. I can get out. It'll be fine.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.245
Everything at work is fine.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.925
Stop with all the questions, Lorna,
will you? I'm late enough as it is!

03:22.525 --> 03:24.685
I think you look lovely, sweetheart.

03:26.445 --> 03:27.605
Fuck!

03:32.005 --> 03:33.285
Yeah.

03:33.365 --> 03:34.685
Bye.

03:35.845 --> 03:38.805
Go in. There's nothing interesting to see.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.885
-You're going to love it.
-Uh-huh?

04:02.965 --> 04:07.085
Yep. You really have to pass
a lot of heroin addicts to get here.

04:07.165 --> 04:10.285
I know, right? It's crazy. People in this
neighbourhood seem to really love heroin.

04:10.365 --> 04:11.525
I don't know why.

04:12.525 --> 04:14.165
So, what do you think?

04:15.125 --> 04:17.685
-What am I looking at?
-That.

04:17.765 --> 04:21.205
All Steve's Pals.
Don't worry, it's a lot nicer inside.

04:23.605 --> 04:25.084
<i>♪ Ta-da! ♪</i>

04:25.165 --> 04:27.084
[Steve] Go on, get out.

04:27.165 --> 04:29.165
Go on, shoo, shoo.

04:29.245 --> 04:31.325
There's no heroin in here. Go on, out.

04:32.165 --> 04:32.965
Honestly!

04:33.965 --> 04:35.765
-Howdy, business partner.
-Hey.

04:35.845 --> 04:38.405
Howdy, girlfriend-slash-stepmum
of business partner.

04:38.485 --> 04:40.205
-OK.
-Glad you're here, Rachel.

04:40.285 --> 04:41.725
I need a woman's insight.

04:41.805 --> 04:45.725
If you were a cocktail waitress,
would you rather be topless or wrestling?

04:46.725 --> 04:49.405
-I think I'd rather be suing.
-Huh. Right!

04:50.085 --> 04:52.085
Before the licensing meeting,

04:52.165 --> 04:55.245
who fancies the latest cocktail
from the production line?

04:55.325 --> 04:56.765
I've been trying out recipes.

04:56.845 --> 04:59.925
Here's a sexy USP -
the cocktails at All Steve's Pals

05:00.005 --> 05:04.525
are named after high-profile
glamorous figures from the Midlands.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.245
-Great idea, right?
-Sure, it's...

05:07.325 --> 05:08.685
Yeah, but...

05:08.765 --> 05:11.405
-Yeah.
-This one is the Dion Dublin.

05:11.485 --> 05:12.485
OK.

05:15.245 --> 05:18.605
Urgh! Oh, the taste of being
absolutely shitfaced in the morning.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.485
-How strong is that?
-That's 75% proof.

05:21.045 --> 05:24.245
You don't get 183 career goals
without having a kick.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.405
-Yeah!
-Now, this one

05:25.485 --> 05:29.605
is a potent mix of gin, vodka, absinthe,
coffee and Ribena.

05:29.685 --> 05:32.245
I call this the Julie Walters.

05:32.325 --> 05:33.685
-Tuck in.
-Ah, no.

05:33.765 --> 05:36.165
-I quite like my stomach lining, thanks.
-Yeah.

05:36.725 --> 05:39.845
I probably shouldn't before the licensing
meeting. Don't want to screw that up.

05:39.925 --> 05:43.085
Can you imagine?
All of a sudden, no licence, no bar.

05:43.165 --> 05:44.725
All of our money back.

05:45.765 --> 05:48.725
Actually, um, thinking about it,

05:48.805 --> 05:52.325
if you're going to run a bar,
you need to know the drinks.

05:52.405 --> 05:55.005
-Go on.
-Right, but I don't drink.

05:55.085 --> 05:57.685
[chanting] Dale! Dale! Dale!

05:57.765 --> 05:59.445
[both] Dale! Dale!

05:59.525 --> 06:01.965
Oh, come on!
You know I can't resist a chant.

06:02.045 --> 06:03.725
[both] Dale! Dale!

06:04.445 --> 06:06.845
-Yeah!
-Mm!

06:06.925 --> 06:09.925
-Tastes like my tongue's been attacked.
-That's Dame Julie for you.

06:10.565 --> 06:13.485
-More, more, more!
-[both] More, more, more.

06:14.925 --> 06:16.445
Yeah!

06:16.525 --> 06:17.765
Woo!

06:18.805 --> 06:21.485
-[woman] We offer three meals a day.
-[Lorna] Great.

06:21.565 --> 06:24.205
Won't even have to bother whopping
a sausage and mash on for him!

06:24.285 --> 06:28.085
All the food here is strictly vegan
and ethically sourced.

06:28.165 --> 06:30.285
Oh, Sid's a vegan.

06:30.365 --> 06:31.765
We all are.

06:31.845 --> 06:34.365
I make a mean vegan sausage and mash

06:34.445 --> 06:37.605
with vegan sausages and vegan... potatoes?

06:39.445 --> 06:41.405
I'm so sorry my husband's late.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.285
I'll just get the forms.

06:46.165 --> 06:47.525
Where the hell have you been?

06:48.085 --> 06:50.045
Why have you got popcorn
all over your suit?

06:50.125 --> 06:51.765
It's a lawyer thing.
You wouldn't understand.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.365
Um... Can we maybe
get all that crap off him?

06:55.445 --> 06:57.205
Leave him, he's happy in it.

06:58.125 --> 07:01.125
Sorry I'm late. Hope you're not going
to put me on the naughty step.

07:01.205 --> 07:03.885
We prefer to not use negative labels here.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.165
We prefer to use positive reinforcement.

07:06.245 --> 07:08.045
Oh, my bad.

07:08.925 --> 07:10.925
Please don't use the B-word.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.205
Bet she's fun at parties.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.365
OK, so we'll move on to the next question.

07:20.445 --> 07:23.165
Will there be alcohol sales
at the aforementioned premises?

07:23.245 --> 07:27.005
[laughing] Yes! Obviously!

07:27.085 --> 07:28.965
This thing is going to be huge,
let me tell you.

07:29.045 --> 07:31.805
Everybody's going to be like,
"Hey, have you been to All Steve's Pals?"

07:31.885 --> 07:34.325
And they'll be like,
"What's All Steve's Pals?"

07:34.405 --> 07:38.485
"Oh, jeez, only the best damn cocktail bar
in all Lichfield, duh!"

07:39.085 --> 07:40.205
-Dale.
-Yeah?

07:40.285 --> 07:43.365
You're coming across as drunk.
I'll field that question.

07:43.925 --> 07:45.645
There will be alcohol.

07:45.725 --> 07:47.245
Would you like a sneak preview?

07:48.125 --> 07:50.725
I've got a fresh bottle of Adrian Chiles.

07:52.245 --> 07:53.205
No, thank you.

07:53.285 --> 07:55.885
[snorts with laughter]
You freaking get it!

07:55.965 --> 07:57.325
[laughing]

07:57.405 --> 08:00.085
This, right here,
this is what it's all about. Man!

08:00.765 --> 08:03.085
You... You get it, Frank.

08:03.165 --> 08:06.245
OK, listen, can I be frank, Frank?

08:06.325 --> 08:09.845
[laughing] "Frank, Frank!"
That's hilarious!

08:09.925 --> 08:12.525
See, this is why you get it. Exactly.

08:12.605 --> 08:16.005
Everybody else in this council,
they don't get it, but you...

08:17.085 --> 08:18.845
you get it, yeah, yeah.

08:19.445 --> 08:22.285
It says on the application that
the premises will be an indoor beach bar.

08:22.365 --> 08:24.245
Correcto, Franco.

08:25.125 --> 08:31.485
All Steve's Pals will be the ultimate
in Miami-style high-class beach bars.

08:32.365 --> 08:33.685
Have you seen the video "Club Tropicana"?

08:33.765 --> 08:36.405
It's basically going to be that,
but with topless dancers.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.485
So there will be entertainment on-site?

08:38.564 --> 08:40.645
All Steve's Pals
is all about entertainment.

08:40.725 --> 08:44.085
Dancers, swing ball, duelling.

08:44.164 --> 08:46.485
-It's the lot!
-[liquid splashing]

08:46.564 --> 08:48.205
-Dale! Psst!
-[urinating]

08:48.285 --> 08:50.525
Yeah, yeah, carry on.
Carry on. I'm listening.

08:50.605 --> 08:52.845
-I just really needed to go.
-OK, I think we're done here.

08:52.925 --> 08:54.685
-Thank you.
-All right.

08:54.765 --> 08:58.325
Sorry, I'm back.
So, when do we get the licence?

08:58.405 --> 08:59.845
Also, do you know
what colour the licence is?

08:59.925 --> 09:02.925
And do you want to get a kebab?
I'm so hungry.

09:03.005 --> 09:05.645
The licence has not been granted.

09:07.845 --> 09:10.245
Bad move, Mr Suit-and-Tie.

09:11.565 --> 09:13.925
The council has made
a powerful enemy today.

09:29.365 --> 09:31.765
There must be something we can do,
anything, please.

09:31.845 --> 09:34.765
Like, just...
We just really need this licence.

09:38.565 --> 09:41.605
Perhaps if it was... worth my while?

09:43.565 --> 09:46.805
There are ways to, er, grease the wheel.

09:50.405 --> 09:54.085
This could go easier
if I got my slice of the pie.

09:56.765 --> 09:58.965
Seriously? Here's my card.

09:59.525 --> 10:02.125
I'm just going to write
a few random letters on the back.

10:02.205 --> 10:06.845
B-R-I-B-E.

10:11.725 --> 10:13.685
Frank! [laughs]

10:14.245 --> 10:18.285
Sorry, I just remembered the whole "Frank,
Frank" thing from earlier. Great times.

10:19.205 --> 10:22.085
Right, um, if you don't mind, I just...

10:22.165 --> 10:25.125
I'm going to have to go vomit,
but it was really nice meeting you.

10:31.325 --> 10:32.685
[woman] I'll be honest with you,

10:32.765 --> 10:35.405
I'd <i>love</i> to find Sid a place here.

10:35.485 --> 10:38.325
[squeals] Oh, that's great!

10:39.565 --> 10:41.925
We've never had
a transgender child before.

10:43.845 --> 10:45.845
-Sorry?
-I know, strictly speaking,

10:45.925 --> 10:47.245
there aren't any places available,

10:47.325 --> 10:52.165
but between you and me,
I've been holding back a space

10:52.245 --> 10:55.765
for a non-cis child
for the last three years.

10:55.845 --> 10:58.405
OK, I think there's been
a bit of a mistake...

10:58.485 --> 10:59.925
That's great, Frances.

11:00.005 --> 11:04.445
It's great to find a place where Sid
can be who Sid wants to be.

11:04.525 --> 11:09.005
Mm! My daughter goes here, and I think
she'd really get along with Sid.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.885
They're such similar spirits.

11:11.765 --> 11:15.285
Sid's having a birthday party tomorrow.
Just bring her along!

11:15.365 --> 11:16.485
I'd love to.

11:17.765 --> 11:20.085
Number's on the back of the card.

11:20.165 --> 11:22.685
OK, Lorna, can I have a word, please,
in private?

11:27.125 --> 11:30.405
OK, we are not pretending
that Sid is transgender.

11:30.485 --> 11:32.565
-We don't know he isn't.
-We're pretty sure, actually.

11:32.645 --> 11:35.605
-It's a really good nursery, Ken.
-But is it <i>this</i> good, Lorna?

11:35.685 --> 11:39.165
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Can everyone just hold on a minute here?

11:39.245 --> 11:42.805
[hisses] Ken! Shut this down
and you will never ever

11:42.885 --> 11:45.205
have sexual intercourse again
in your adult life.

11:47.845 --> 11:50.605
-Right. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

11:51.525 --> 11:53.365
OK, Sidney. Where are you?

11:53.445 --> 11:54.565
Oh!

11:57.165 --> 12:01.085
I wasn't sure what birthday cake
really says "gender fluid".

12:01.605 --> 12:04.765
-So I just went for plain sponge.
-It's got no icing.

12:04.845 --> 12:07.645
Maybe I should text Frances,
see what she says.

12:08.965 --> 12:11.125
No. She'll think we're amateurs.

12:11.205 --> 12:13.045
Mental, mental amateurs.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.325
Oh, I bumped into Noel
from your office when I was there.

12:15.965 --> 12:17.405
What?

12:17.485 --> 12:21.125
You know he lies, don't you?
He can't be trusted. It's pathological.

12:21.205 --> 12:23.405
He told me he invented the smartphone.
He's a lunatic.

12:23.485 --> 12:25.925
It was weird.
He asked me to say hi to you.

12:26.805 --> 12:30.245
That <i>is</i> weird.
Ah, probably best not to dwell on it.

12:30.325 --> 12:32.685
I told him to bring Alfie over
to the party tomorrow.

12:32.765 --> 12:35.125
-Why would you do that?
-Him and Sid get on.

12:35.205 --> 12:37.525
They're toddlers, Lorna,
of course they get on.

12:37.605 --> 12:40.005
Sid gets on with the mad woman
with the cats at number 14.

12:40.085 --> 12:41.405
Should we invite her, too?

12:41.485 --> 12:44.125
Oh, look what I got for Sid.

12:44.205 --> 12:47.125
-The belle of the ball.
-OK, this is going too far, Lorna.

12:48.005 --> 12:49.525
Yeah, I know.

12:50.805 --> 12:53.245
Maybe it doesn't matter
about what nursery you go to.

12:53.325 --> 12:57.045
I mean, Dylan didn't go to a good nursery
and he turned out fine.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.725
-How was your day, love?
-Um, amazing!

13:00.485 --> 13:03.365
I never realised they still have
to pay you when you're using the toilet.

13:04.245 --> 13:06.285
It's like, every time
I'm sat on that toilet,

13:06.365 --> 13:08.525
they're actually paying me to do it.

13:08.605 --> 13:10.485
I mean, I need to go for one now,

13:10.565 --> 13:12.805
but there is no chance
I am wasting a dump at home

13:12.885 --> 13:16.285
when someone will, literally,
pay me to shit.

13:16.365 --> 13:18.285
Ha! The daft twats!

13:18.365 --> 13:20.485
-Yeah, as you were, Lorn.
-Yeah.

13:20.565 --> 13:21.605
[door closes]

13:22.485 --> 13:25.085
-Everything OK?
-No, bad news, guys.

13:25.165 --> 13:27.285
[sighs] The alcohol licence fell through.

13:27.885 --> 13:31.445
-No cocktail bar.
-Aw! That's a shame.

13:31.525 --> 13:34.045
And the council guy, he was saying
some pretty weird things.

13:34.125 --> 13:38.885
Something about making it worth his while
and having a slice of pie.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.485
Like, what does that even mean?

13:40.565 --> 13:42.885
-I don't know.
-He wants to bribe you, dickhead.

13:42.965 --> 13:45.685
Just bung him some money,
you'll get your licence.

13:45.765 --> 13:48.485
You're saying if I bribe him,
the bar is back on?

13:48.565 --> 13:49.765
-No!
-Yes!

13:49.845 --> 13:51.805
What? Ha-ha!

13:51.885 --> 13:54.845
Yes! That is the best news ever!

13:57.805 --> 14:00.765
Oh, gosh, not in the stomach, Rach.

14:01.285 --> 14:03.965
-I've got a lot packed in there right now.
-Urgh!

14:04.445 --> 14:07.245
This is so exciting. My final five grand!

14:08.045 --> 14:10.965
Wait, this whole bribe thing,
it's all above board, right?

14:11.045 --> 14:13.925
-No, it's a bribe.
-Right, yeah.

14:14.645 --> 14:18.005
This is how things get done in the dirty
world of entertainments licensing.

14:18.085 --> 14:19.805
We are like the Kray twins.

14:19.885 --> 14:22.005
We don't take shit from any--

14:23.045 --> 14:24.685
Oh, come on!

14:26.085 --> 14:28.565
You are, literally,
taking shit from someone.

14:28.645 --> 14:31.205
-I'm very disappointed in you.
-I'm sorry.

14:32.485 --> 14:34.045
Have a lovely day.

14:34.725 --> 14:38.245
Stop being nice to people. You're taking
the whole fun out of this bribing trip.

14:39.205 --> 14:40.565
Prick!

14:42.005 --> 14:43.165
Bye.

14:43.845 --> 14:45.125
[Steve] Ha-ha!

14:51.965 --> 14:54.365
I've managed to get Sid into the dress.

14:54.445 --> 14:57.285
-He says he wants to be Spider-Man.
-Good work.

14:57.365 --> 14:59.605
Lorn, is it wrong that we're doing this?

14:59.685 --> 15:01.765
-It feels massively wrong.
-Maybe.

15:02.805 --> 15:06.885
Maybe, actually, by doing this,
we're being great parents.

15:07.605 --> 15:11.325
-By helping him to overcome prejudice.
-Yeah. That's bollocks, though, isn't it?

15:11.405 --> 15:12.405
[doorbell]

15:15.365 --> 15:17.845
-Noel, hi!
-Lorna, how's it going?

15:17.925 --> 15:19.285
Hello, Noel.

15:19.845 --> 15:22.685
Lorn, could you check on Sid? I think he
was playing with scissors in the bedroom.

15:22.765 --> 15:24.245
-What?
-Yeah.

15:25.685 --> 15:28.885
How are you holding up, big guy?
The office isn't the same without you.

15:28.965 --> 15:30.325
Come on, then. Yeah...

15:30.405 --> 15:33.205
Yeah, can we have a moratorium
on work talk?

15:33.285 --> 15:36.485
-Today's really about the kids, isn't it?
-Yeah, it's awful what they've done.

15:36.565 --> 15:38.725
I'm dead against the suspension, Ken,
I want you to know that.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.645
-And I want Lorna to know the same.
-Well, we don't need to tell her.

15:41.725 --> 15:44.485
-It'll only upset her, OK?
-I should have tried harder to stop this.

15:44.565 --> 15:46.765
-Stop what?
-Private conversation!

15:46.845 --> 15:49.965
That's actually quite rude, thank you,
Lorna. In you go, Noel. Have a nice time.

15:50.605 --> 15:51.845
[doorbell]

15:52.885 --> 15:55.405
-Oh! You made it!
-Hello.

15:55.485 --> 15:58.365
-Hello.
-This is Jessie.

15:58.445 --> 16:01.885
-Hello.
-Jessie, you go and play with Sid, OK?

16:02.765 --> 16:05.885
Oh! What a darling dress.

16:05.965 --> 16:10.165
Yes, yes, it's his favourite.
I can't get it off him.

16:10.805 --> 16:12.325
-Not that I'd want to.
-No.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.805
It's great. Come in.

16:14.885 --> 16:17.365
Oh, this is for Sid.
It matches his dress.

16:17.445 --> 16:19.165
[Lorna laughs] Oh!

16:25.205 --> 16:28.045
This is it, the licence officer's house.

16:28.765 --> 16:31.445
Time to make him an offer he can't refuse.

16:31.525 --> 16:33.805
Although, technically, of course, he can.

16:43.365 --> 16:44.605
I don't think he's in.

16:46.765 --> 16:47.845
Steve?

16:48.685 --> 16:50.685
Just post the bribe
and let's get out of here.

16:56.005 --> 16:58.325
OK. That's it, we're done.

16:58.405 --> 17:00.485
-We are bribers now.
-Yeah!

17:01.405 --> 17:04.045
Wait, should we still have the money?

17:04.125 --> 17:06.325
What have you posted?

17:13.084 --> 17:14.084
Yep.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.205
-I posted the dog poo.
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.324
Oh, Dale!

17:26.005 --> 17:28.525
We'd already had a boy and a girl,
which is so binary.

17:28.604 --> 17:29.885
-Mm.
-Then Sid came along.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.485
Yeah!

17:31.565 --> 17:33.685
-Mini-burger?
-Mm-hm.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.485
Wow. And these are vegan?

17:39.565 --> 17:40.685
Lorna, they're sublime.

17:40.765 --> 17:43.405
Yeah, vegan. Vegan beef.

17:44.165 --> 17:46.125
You'll have to give me the recipe.

17:46.205 --> 17:48.885
-Uh-huh.
-So, Lorna, just to say,

17:48.965 --> 17:52.085
-I know you're angry about it--
-Game time, everyone!

17:52.165 --> 17:55.005
[claps hands] Musical statues.
Everyone! And the adults.

17:55.085 --> 17:58.125
-Oh!
-And you, Noel. It's a party. Come on.

17:58.805 --> 18:01.565
-And everybody's dancing!
-[music begins]

18:10.565 --> 18:11.765
[music stops]

18:14.725 --> 18:17.805
-So, yeah, as I was saying--
-No talking in the game, thank you, Noel.

18:17.885 --> 18:20.685
In fact, you can leave the game. You're
out. Away from Lorna, over there, please.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.605
That's it. Off we go!

18:23.685 --> 18:25.605
[music starts]

18:28.165 --> 18:30.405
Back in the fucking game, Lorna, please.

18:31.285 --> 18:34.365
Still in.
Off we go dancing!

18:35.925 --> 18:38.285
Everyone dance. That's it.

18:50.645 --> 18:52.285
I can't reach it.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.765
There's an open skylight on the roof.

18:57.565 --> 18:59.525
There's only one thing for it.

18:59.605 --> 19:03.805
I'll parkour up the side of the house,
flip up onto the roof and ease my way in.

19:04.805 --> 19:06.405
Let's do this!

19:14.925 --> 19:16.005
Oh!

19:17.565 --> 19:19.965
Good news is, I got the bag. Bad news...

19:21.165 --> 19:22.765
poop's still in the house.

19:26.245 --> 19:28.245
There's a window open.

19:31.525 --> 19:34.485
-Give me a leg up. I can get in here.
-Are you sure?

19:35.365 --> 19:37.405
Dale, I'm effectively special ops.

19:37.485 --> 19:39.805
They call me the Eel.
I can glide into any space.

19:39.885 --> 19:41.725
Come on. Give me a leg up.

19:51.165 --> 19:52.765
[grunts]

20:02.405 --> 20:03.845
OK.

20:04.565 --> 20:06.805
Flip me over. Flip me over.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.165
Flip.

20:12.885 --> 20:14.605
That's it. Now push.

20:15.165 --> 20:17.605
Keep pushing. Keep pushing.

20:17.685 --> 20:20.245
[coins clattering]

20:20.325 --> 20:22.485
Whoa, you carry a lot of change.

20:22.565 --> 20:24.925
I like arcades. Keep pushing.

20:26.165 --> 20:27.685
[strains]

20:28.805 --> 20:31.485
-[crash, clatter]
-Are you OK?

20:31.565 --> 20:34.725
-It's all right, the ground broke my fall.
-[clattering]

20:34.805 --> 20:36.565
Just going to black out for a bit.

20:36.645 --> 20:38.645
I'm in a lot of pain.

20:39.165 --> 20:41.685
In a lot of... pain.

20:42.485 --> 20:44.565
[children chattering]

20:51.125 --> 20:53.045
[Noel] Poo? You did a poo-poo?

20:55.445 --> 20:57.045
-Hi, Ken.
-Hi.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.205
I couldn't help noticing
that you only gave a prize

20:59.285 --> 21:01.925
to the winner of musical statues.

21:02.525 --> 21:04.245
-Yeah, because they won.
-Hm.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.205
Just worried that the others
might associate themselves with failure.

21:08.285 --> 21:09.805
Negative reinforcement.

21:09.885 --> 21:11.725
Good point.

21:11.805 --> 21:14.365
I'll get some medals made up
for all of them.

21:14.445 --> 21:16.405
Great. Thanks, Ken.

21:17.765 --> 21:19.525
Ken, is there somewhere I can change him?

21:19.605 --> 21:22.005
Oh, yeah, just use that room
at the end of the corridor.

21:22.085 --> 21:23.725
Cheers, thanks. Come on.

21:23.805 --> 21:26.965
-Rachel, where's your mum?
-Oh, she's in my room, changing Sid.

21:27.045 --> 21:29.565
[spaghetti western theme]

21:40.085 --> 21:41.645
-You're going to do it now?
-Yeah.

21:41.725 --> 21:44.725
-Why not stay here for a bit?
-Because my son needs changing.

21:45.605 --> 21:48.885
-What are you doing, Ken?
-Why don't I change him for you?

21:48.965 --> 21:50.045
What?

21:50.125 --> 21:52.845
I'd really, really like to,
and it is my house, so...

21:52.925 --> 21:55.565
-I'll change my own son, thanks.
-No, no, I insist.

21:55.645 --> 21:59.685
Come on, little fella.
Jesus! What's he been eating, fish heads?

21:59.765 --> 22:02.445
-Can you let go of his hand, please?
-What is this?

22:02.525 --> 22:07.565
Is it a nanny state? Can't a man change
another man's son's nappy?

22:08.925 --> 22:10.445
-Ken!
-No, he can't.

22:10.525 --> 22:12.325
-What's going on?
-Ken's being weird.

22:12.405 --> 22:14.965
I just offered to change his son.
Nothing weird.

22:15.045 --> 22:16.605
You're being weird, Ken.

22:16.685 --> 22:17.845
Look at you.

22:17.925 --> 22:20.205
I know you're under a lot of pressure
at work, but come on!

22:20.285 --> 22:22.045
If you need to change anyone,
change your own son.

22:22.125 --> 22:26.125
-What sort of pressure at work?
-I think you should leave, actually, Noel.

22:26.205 --> 22:27.365
You can't say that.

22:27.445 --> 22:30.685
Thinking I should change my son
just because he's wearing a dress.

22:30.765 --> 22:33.005
-That's not what I meant!
-It's not the Dark Ages.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.805
I think you should go right now.
Without speaking to Lorna.

22:35.885 --> 22:38.725
Personally, I think it's inspirational
the way Ken and Lorna

22:38.805 --> 22:40.725
-have decided to raise Sid.
-Thank you.

22:40.805 --> 22:43.365
I'm not having a go at the dress.
He can wear what he wants.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.445
Daddy made me wear it for nursery.

22:48.805 --> 22:50.125
Is that true?

22:51.605 --> 22:57.085
I can't believe you would fake
a child's gender identity

22:57.165 --> 22:59.285
just to get into a good nursery.

23:00.725 --> 23:02.285
We've done a lot worse.

23:03.565 --> 23:05.285
Come on, Jessie.

23:06.005 --> 23:08.005
[Lorna] Thank you for coming.

23:08.085 --> 23:10.845
Um... Don't forget your party bags.

23:10.925 --> 23:12.965
[children crying]

23:21.485 --> 23:23.125
Two bunches, please.

23:23.205 --> 23:24.805
And can the message say,

23:24.885 --> 23:28.605
"Sorry we tried to trick you into thinking
our child was transgender

23:28.685 --> 23:32.325
-to gain a nursery place."
-Yeah, maybe just, "Sorry."

23:32.405 --> 23:35.685
Yeah, just, "Sorry."
As soon as possible, please.

23:37.525 --> 23:40.405
-We need to smooth this over.
-Huh.

23:44.685 --> 23:46.165
[gasping]

23:54.645 --> 23:56.845
How are we doing out there, Dale?

23:56.925 --> 24:00.765
One knock for fine,
two knocks for someone's coming.

24:00.845 --> 24:02.445
[knock]

24:02.525 --> 24:05.365
Three knocks for Connie called you
and she wants me back.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.605
Come on, three. Ah!

24:08.325 --> 24:10.645
I'll get some bog roll to wrap this up.

24:18.645 --> 24:22.325
No, Dale, no more Mr Nice Guy,
you're a briber now.

24:25.325 --> 24:28.245
[sighs] Just as I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

24:29.965 --> 24:32.845
Hi, ma'am, I'm Dale.
Do you need some help?

24:34.285 --> 24:36.565
Wow, you have a lot of shopping.

24:38.365 --> 24:40.485
So many bags for just two people.

24:46.365 --> 24:51.885
Oh, you've been such a good girl today,
haven't you.

24:51.965 --> 24:55.005
-[phone beeps]
-Ooh, Mummy's got a message.

24:55.085 --> 24:56.965
What's that, then?

24:59.045 --> 25:00.125
Hm.

25:03.685 --> 25:07.365
-[gasps]
-Hi. Steve Chance.
