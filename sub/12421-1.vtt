00:46.340 --> 00:50.875
the Year of our Lord
*1348*

00:53.971 --> 00:55.530
<i>The fumes of the dead,</i>

00:55.739 --> 00:57.739
<i>hung in the air like poison.</i>

00:59.051 --> 01:00.290
<i>A plague,</i>

01:00.493 --> 01:02.990
<i>more cruel and more
pitiless than war,</i>

01:03.256 --> 01:04.756
<i>had descended upon us.</i>

01:06.170 --> 01:07.260
<i>A pestilence,</i>

01:07.359 --> 01:09.859
<i>that would leave half
our kingdom dead.</i>

01:14.885 --> 01:16.385
<i>Where did it come from?</i>

01:17.301 --> 01:19.101
<i>What carried it's germ?</i>

01:21.011 --> 01:23.500
<i>The priests told us
it was God's punishment.</i>

01:24.522 --> 01:25.722
<i>For what sin?</i>

01:26.287 --> 01:29.130
<i>What commandment must we
break that would earn this?</i>

01:31.051 --> 01:32.051
<i>No.</i>

01:32.583 --> 01:33.920
<i>We knew the truth.</i>

01:35.651 --> 01:37.420
<i>This was not God's work,</i>

01:38.227 --> 01:39.427
<i>but devilry.</i>

01:40.510 --> 01:41.910
<i>Or witchcraft.</i>

01:42.889 --> 01:44.140
<i>And our task,</i>

01:44.444 --> 01:45.860
<i>to hunt down a demon,</i>

01:46.980 --> 01:48.338
<i>is God's cure.</i>

02:34.885 --> 02:35.985
Brother Thomas!

02:38.281 --> 02:39.481
Brother Thomas!

03:03.494 --> 03:04.790
Who was taken from us?

03:04.910 --> 03:06.211
Brother Ignatius.

03:06.423 --> 03:07.720
Is it the pestilence?

03:07.720 --> 03:09.054
We have not been told.

03:09.573 --> 03:10.873
I have no signs.

03:12.075 --> 03:13.260
Please brother.

03:14.842 --> 03:15.985
Let me out.

05:43.053 --> 05:44.053
Averill.

05:48.678 --> 05:50.178
O thanks pretty gorgeous.

05:50.636 --> 05:51.866
Where've you been?

05:51.985 --> 05:54.060
I was confined.
They thought I was sick.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.021
I thought you were dead.

06:03.428 --> 06:06.528
I'm alright.
I prayed, prayed all the time.

06:07.157 --> 06:08.257
I'm alright.

06:10.615 --> 06:11.815
I've brought food.

06:17.670 --> 06:18.861
One of our brothers,

06:19.590 --> 06:21.300
he died this morning, Averill.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.517
Even the monastery is no longer safe,
you must go now.

06:24.970 --> 06:29.040
You must go back to Dentwich Forest
and you must hide there till this is passed.

06:29.511 --> 06:30.700
On Sunday,

06:30.797 --> 06:32.106
the prior said the pestilence,

06:32.130 --> 06:34.908
was God's new purge
send to wash away our sins.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.800
Is God punishing us?

06:38.897 --> 06:39.897
No.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.440
No.

06:45.532 --> 06:46.732
You must go now.

06:48.084 --> 06:49.730
You must go back to Dentwich.

06:55.824 --> 06:56.920
You must go.

07:14.886 --> 07:16.021
Osmund, I...

07:16.323 --> 07:17.523
Averill, you'll die.

07:17.761 --> 07:19.061
And you will not?

07:24.974 --> 07:26.110
Come with me.

07:26.950 --> 07:28.588
If I leave the monastery now,

07:28.672 --> 07:29.772
I betray God.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.728
We've already betrayed him.

08:14.803 --> 08:16.206
You know the Martyrs Cross,

08:17.100 --> 08:18.272
at Dentwich forest?

08:20.456 --> 08:23.560
I will wait for you there,
every morning at dawn for one week.

08:27.110 --> 08:28.530
And then I will be gone.

09:05.950 --> 09:07.184
Forgive me, Father.

09:07.186 --> 09:08.386
I am confused.

09:08.672 --> 09:10.320
I confess, I am torn.

09:13.938 --> 09:16.370
Can I serve you outside of these walls?

09:16.889 --> 09:18.180
I would leave here,

09:18.290 --> 09:20.738
but I would never stray
from your grace, father.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.090
Show me Your will.

09:27.687 --> 09:29.100
Father, give me a sign.

10:05.650 --> 10:08.137
I am Ulric, envoy to the bishop.

10:09.628 --> 10:12.130
What I say know does
not leave these walls.

10:14.179 --> 10:17.779
Word has reached the bishop of a
village that does not suffer as the rest.

10:19.797 --> 10:22.160
They say it is a sanctuary
from the pestilence.

10:23.661 --> 10:28.100
There are many villages that have not
been ravaged yet by the pestilence.

10:28.179 --> 10:32.079
It is claimed, these villagers
are beyond death's icy grasp.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.937
Then they are gravely mistaken.

10:38.343 --> 10:40.200
These are difficult times.

10:41.679 --> 10:42.770
Such claims,

10:43.528 --> 10:44.928
however fantastical,

10:45.179 --> 10:48.579
can find favor with those less
educated than you or I.

10:49.804 --> 10:54.462
Precisely why we cannot fall
foul of rumor and superstition.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.979
God's grip on his people is lucent.

10:57.482 --> 11:01.948
We must ensure the flock is not tempted
to look beyond God and church for answers.

11:04.929 --> 11:07.729
I must see for myself how
this village is kept safe.

11:08.350 --> 11:10.230
What part have we in this?

11:10.324 --> 11:12.680
The village I seek lies in
the great marsh.

11:13.221 --> 11:14.786
I require a guide,

11:14.870 --> 11:16.880
a man of God to show the way.

11:17.138 --> 11:19.338
No man here fit for such a task.

11:21.846 --> 11:24.846
With the bishop's blessing
I may choose any man here.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.040
Out of respect,

11:27.930 --> 11:29.402
I grant you that choice.

11:29.513 --> 11:30.713
I will lead you there.

11:31.934 --> 11:34.210
No, he is a mere novice.

11:34.620 --> 11:36.837
This requires a more experienced hand.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.110
Let him speak.

11:38.638 --> 11:40.646
The said village you seek lies
in the great marsh.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.540
I was raised,
close by in Dentwich Forest.

11:44.169 --> 11:45.924
I know the area better than any man.

11:48.489 --> 11:50.338
He has all the experience I require.

11:52.070 --> 11:53.190
You will lead us.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.440
We leave at dawn.

11:56.930 --> 11:58.120
Osmund,

11:58.329 --> 12:01.529
that man is more dangerous
than the pestilence itself.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.411
Father, I prayed for guidance.

12:04.596 --> 12:05.696
God has answered.

12:25.805 --> 12:27.269
Even if you survive,

12:27.380 --> 12:29.271
the world out there will change you.

12:29.689 --> 12:31.378
Perhaps that's what I want Father.

14:35.847 --> 14:37.347
God has no men left,

14:38.805 --> 14:40.205
he sends us a boy.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.104
Are you up to it, son?

14:43.388 --> 14:44.650
I can lead you there.

14:45.910 --> 14:46.980
Pray you do.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.714
Split any man from
his asshole to his apple.

14:52.597 --> 14:53.697
What's that for?

14:55.639 --> 14:56.939
How much does he know?

14:57.472 --> 14:58.617
Ulric was...

14:58.919 --> 15:00.441
frugal shall we say,

15:01.443 --> 15:02.443
with the truth.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.472
This village we're headed to...

15:07.783 --> 15:09.270
they've cast God aside.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.270
In his place sits a demon.

15:12.672 --> 15:14.160
There was talk of sacrifice.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.250
Of men eating men,

15:16.682 --> 15:18.050
and of raising the dead.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.560
Now we're charged,

15:19.741 --> 15:21.940
to bring the leader of this village
back for confession,

15:21.970 --> 15:23.270
trial and execution.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.362
The bishop seeks to roast
themself a necromancer.

15:26.479 --> 15:27.830
Sorry, what is a necromancer?

15:27.971 --> 15:29.110
A necromancer,

15:29.355 --> 15:31.020
is someone who plucks the dead,

15:31.120 --> 15:32.160
from the cold earth,

15:32.639 --> 15:34.439
breathes new life into them.

15:36.347 --> 15:37.400
We have the tools,

15:37.623 --> 15:38.700
we have the will.

15:39.056 --> 15:40.356
We journey into hell.

15:42.264 --> 15:43.601
But God travels with us.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.021
So you misled me.

15:46.056 --> 15:48.238
Return to your monastery
if you feel betrayed,

15:48.240 --> 15:49.240
or join us...

15:49.612 --> 15:51.012
and do God's work.

15:51.789 --> 15:54.489
Let's get this cleared up,
let's get going!

15:56.155 --> 15:57.930
That includes you, Swire.

16:42.723 --> 16:44.323
We are not as bad as you think.

16:45.889 --> 16:49.753
We're worse.
But we need you alive.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.700
You seem well suited
to keeping men alive.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.981
I've spent many a long years in
the king's army with Wolfstan and Griff.

16:58.550 --> 16:59.835
I'll be honest with ya.

17:00.005 --> 17:01.840
We've never faced a demon before,

17:02.160 --> 17:03.708
but we take what comes our way.

17:04.436 --> 17:05.640
What happened to him?

17:05.910 --> 17:07.150
Ivo was captured.

17:07.973 --> 17:09.276
Wouldn't talk,

17:09.578 --> 17:11.877
so the bastard French tore out
his tongue.

17:15.390 --> 17:16.207
And him?

17:16.271 --> 17:17.972
Mold is a men to leave alone...

17:18.306 --> 17:20.006
unless there is butchery to be done.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.357
And Dalywag,

17:21.825 --> 17:23.020
he is a torturer,

17:23.185 --> 17:24.220
a hangman,

17:24.464 --> 17:25.829
and if the rumor is true,

17:25.920 --> 17:26.829
murderer,

17:26.901 --> 17:28.901
thief and defiler of women.

17:29.595 --> 17:31.280
But apart from that,
he's a good man.

17:33.007 --> 17:34.160
What about Ulric?

17:34.362 --> 17:35.860
I've got a wife and child.

17:36.235 --> 17:37.524
I'm here for the money.

17:37.630 --> 17:39.126
Ulric is here because,

17:39.515 --> 17:41.520
God told him to come.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.129
Burn!

17:53.473 --> 17:54.473
Burn!

17:55.515 --> 17:58.217
Have mercy, please have mercy.

18:04.681 --> 18:05.781
I've done nothing.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.355
- We must help her.
- Do you hear me?

18:09.442 --> 18:10.799
You deserve to burn!

18:10.890 --> 18:12.126
I've done nothing.
Burn!

18:12.128 --> 18:14.405
Burn the witch! Burn!

18:18.470 --> 18:20.047
You're in league with the devil.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.042
What is her crime?

18:21.437 --> 18:23.058
She brought death to our village.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.500
Death is all around us,
and it's no invitation.

18:25.515 --> 18:27.508
This does not involve you monk,
step aside.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.626
I have done nothing, please.

18:29.741 --> 18:31.140
Please, stand aside.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.013
What is this woman accused of?

18:37.038 --> 18:40.046
She poisoned our well in a pact with
the devil now half the village is dead.

18:40.070 --> 18:42.338
I offered a simple blessing
over our water,

18:42.489 --> 18:43.610
to keep everyone safe.

18:43.765 --> 18:44.236
Liar.

18:44.238 --> 18:45.338
I did nothing wrong.

18:45.339 --> 18:45.931
Liar!

18:45.932 --> 18:47.770
The dying began after
she was seen at the well.

18:47.772 --> 18:48.772
You have her confession?

18:48.773 --> 18:50.490
Plenty of us saw her cast her spell.

18:50.492 --> 18:51.593
Now she must burn,

18:51.703 --> 18:53.703
to spare what remains of our village.

18:56.456 --> 18:57.610
Move aside.

19:04.037 --> 19:05.570
I will not ask you again.

19:05.848 --> 19:06.848
Back.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.199
Thank you.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.440
Do not stop again.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.290
Come on, brown slug.

20:03.432 --> 20:05.860
As sure as the sun will rise and fall,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.160
witches will burn.

20:08.932 --> 20:13.932
There's a village in the north,
that burned 128 witches in one night.

20:14.437 --> 20:17.580
That's sixteen an hour, for eight hours.

20:17.807 --> 20:19.691
By the time that night was through,

20:19.811 --> 20:21.890
they'd killed every woman in the village.

20:22.557 --> 20:25.157
By the end of that week
the men were shagging pigs.

20:25.932 --> 20:27.729
Pestilence isn't trial enough,

20:28.362 --> 20:30.030
now God has us shagging pigs.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.889
This village we seek,

20:34.541 --> 20:35.543
you been there?

20:35.844 --> 20:36.890
No.

20:37.768 --> 20:39.168
But I know where it lies.

20:39.599 --> 20:40.938
Hell awaits us,

20:41.294 --> 20:42.334
or so we're told.

20:42.432 --> 20:45.110
If you've not got the stomach for it,
then leave it now.

20:45.509 --> 20:47.509
And I'll have your share
of the bounty.

20:48.391 --> 20:51.391
What is the Church believe
this pestilence is come from?

20:51.974 --> 20:54.674
I don't believe God is punishing us
like many do.

20:55.529 --> 20:56.950
I say from France,

20:57.756 --> 20:59.656
where all foul things emerge.

21:00.849 --> 21:03.449
For once Swire, you might
not be too far from the truth.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.857
Three summers passed we fought
a battle at Crecy, in Normandy,

21:09.628 --> 21:11.440
King Edward's army was dwarfed.

21:12.428 --> 21:15.487
For every twenty of us, there were
a hundred Frenchmen, at least.

21:16.266 --> 21:17.266
The French...

21:18.266 --> 21:19.466
Ah, the French.

21:20.823 --> 21:22.290
They could sense victory,

21:22.696 --> 21:23.796
you could smell it.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.027
On that day for the first time,

21:27.600 --> 21:29.320
our archers used the longbow.

21:30.141 --> 21:32.541
Quicker to load, further in flight.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.117
Their arrows,

21:34.230 --> 21:35.530
their arrows were useless.

21:35.647 --> 21:36.752
Couldn't reach us.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.616
And ours,

21:39.002 --> 21:40.540
ours were like a dark,

21:40.663 --> 21:41.640
buzzing cloud.

21:42.461 --> 21:43.640
And that day's end,

21:44.404 --> 21:47.540
field was littered with their dead
and their dying.

21:48.809 --> 21:49.800
And custom,

21:49.952 --> 21:51.440
how matter how fierce the battle,

21:51.849 --> 21:53.649
was to use the misericorde.

21:53.769 --> 21:55.780
Misericorde, it's the 'mercy-giver'.

21:57.308 --> 22:00.110
You stab straight through
the armpit directly into the heart,

22:00.202 --> 22:01.482
it's quick and painless.

22:01.958 --> 22:02.958
But on this day,

22:03.491 --> 22:04.991
there was an end to chivalry.

22:05.641 --> 22:08.490
King Edward ordered
every Frenchman left alive,

22:08.580 --> 22:10.575
to be killed without mercy.

22:12.433 --> 22:13.433
Arms,

22:13.981 --> 22:15.041
heads,

22:15.425 --> 22:16.520
legs,

22:16.790 --> 22:17.810
hacked away.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.582
God's greatest army,

22:21.435 --> 22:22.978
descended into savagery.

22:27.266 --> 22:28.364
Forgive me,

22:28.660 --> 22:30.752
but how does that conscern
the pestilence?

22:31.223 --> 22:33.000
We invited death among us that day.

22:34.602 --> 22:36.197
He hasn't left us since.

23:08.558 --> 23:09.858
That woman you killed,

23:11.567 --> 23:13.054
she was not a witch.

23:16.641 --> 23:18.541
Why did you volanteer to join us, monk?

23:20.975 --> 23:22.175
To serve God.

23:23.689 --> 23:25.204
Killing witches serves God.

23:27.558 --> 23:29.258
The woman was already dead.

23:31.183 --> 23:32.443
If I had freed her,

23:32.740 --> 23:35.392
the mob would have caught
her again and burned her.

23:37.558 --> 23:39.058
I spared her suffering.

23:42.970 --> 23:44.666
Sometimes that is all you can do.

25:12.100 --> 25:13.400
He says turn back.

25:15.059 --> 25:16.332
Where we're headed,

25:17.044 --> 25:18.480
men have become savages.

25:50.809 --> 25:53.750
It must've been something
pretty special to tempt you away

25:53.769 --> 25:55.869
from that nice warm monastery.

26:02.390 --> 26:03.825
Anything you wanna tell me?

26:04.038 --> 26:05.038
No.

26:11.976 --> 26:13.276
You know what my job is?

26:15.270 --> 26:16.456
I am a torturer,

26:17.369 --> 26:18.489
truth-getter.

26:19.025 --> 26:20.440
Spend hours on a man.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.147
Can smell a lie,

26:22.849 --> 26:24.249
and I smell you.

26:25.152 --> 26:27.020
Pray somewhere else,
if I were you.

27:12.900 --> 27:15.000
Have you broken any vows yet, boy?

27:16.100 --> 27:17.300
Leave him be, Mold.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.189
Back, get back!

27:24.491 --> 27:25.491
Griff!

27:26.434 --> 27:27.434
Griff?

27:32.393 --> 27:34.710
- I said get back!
- Leave me alone.

27:34.893 --> 27:35.893
Let me look.

27:38.941 --> 27:39.910
Let me look.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.202
Just going to take a look.

27:45.893 --> 27:46.893
Alright?

27:47.557 --> 27:48.650
Ok my friend.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.136
Just having a look.

28:26.101 --> 28:27.501
Why didn't you tell us?

28:29.660 --> 28:30.643
I'm sorry.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.601
His journey is finished here.

28:42.226 --> 28:43.426
I prefer mercy.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.937
I need to make a confession to the friar.

28:49.068 --> 28:50.230
No.

28:50.310 --> 28:52.110
Cannot be sure how this thing spread.

28:52.111 --> 28:54.311
Who the hell asked you?

28:58.351 --> 28:59.751
I will take your confession.

29:02.185 --> 29:03.585
Come, you shall have absolution.

29:10.727 --> 29:13.557
You keep your mouth, shut!

29:24.014 --> 29:26.330
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis,

29:26.735 --> 29:29.346
in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.521
Forgive me.

29:36.062 --> 29:37.647
Our Father which art in heaven.

29:38.643 --> 29:39.843
Halowed by thy name.

29:40.977 --> 29:42.077
Let thy kingdom come.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.510
Thy will be fulfilled as well
in heven as it is earth.

29:46.644 --> 29:48.340
Give this daily bred give today.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.760
I need a moment with him.

29:57.310 --> 29:58.310
Alright.

30:14.906 --> 30:15.940
I'm glad it's you.

30:17.542 --> 30:18.542
I can see things...

30:30.477 --> 30:31.777
Farewell my friend.

30:47.369 --> 30:48.367
Bury him.

31:22.936 --> 31:24.212
The forest of Dentwich.

31:24.856 --> 31:26.210
How far to the marsh?

31:26.880 --> 31:28.271
Half a day, perhaps less.

31:29.144 --> 31:30.315
Be on your guard.

31:31.204 --> 31:33.340
God has slipped over the horizon.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.186
You're on watch tonight, Swire.

32:00.144 --> 32:01.744
Giving Griff absolution...

32:03.644 --> 32:04.744
took courage.

32:13.852 --> 32:16.452
Do you truly believe this
village can rise the dead?

32:18.140 --> 32:19.840
I would not be here otherwise.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.473
You doubt it?

32:24.394 --> 32:28.064
I believe that hunting necromancers
and demons serves men,

32:28.104 --> 32:29.304
more than it serves god.

32:31.769 --> 32:34.769
You have learned much
nestled inside the monastery.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.978
Demons and necromancers
are among us.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.900
As you will find out.

32:46.670 --> 32:47.870
Soon enough.

32:51.994 --> 32:53.394
I'll get some sleep.

33:55.728 --> 33:56.828
Averill?

34:02.020 --> 34:03.020
Averill?

34:09.478 --> 34:10.578
Averill?

34:24.811 --> 34:25.811
Averill?

34:39.755 --> 34:40.755
No.

34:51.248 --> 34:52.649
No, no, no. No.

34:59.728 --> 35:00.828
Averill!

35:20.187 --> 35:21.287
Wake up!

35:21.770 --> 35:22.770
Ulric!

35:22.813 --> 35:23.813
Get up!

35:23.953 --> 35:24.953
Wolfstan!

35:25.770 --> 35:26.546
Ulric!

35:26.548 --> 35:27.375
Wake up!

35:27.377 --> 35:28.687
Wake up! Ulric!

35:28.898 --> 35:29.790
How many are in the forrest?

35:29.793 --> 35:30.693
Calm down! How many?

35:30.694 --> 35:32.227
What did you see? What did you see?
Several, it's all I saw.

35:32.228 --> 35:34.012
They are in the forrest, I don't...
How many? How many?

35:34.013 --> 35:35.255
I don't know.
I don't know!

35:35.256 --> 35:36.556
How many?
He doesn't know.

35:49.138 --> 35:51.420
Mold, forward now.

36:09.104 --> 36:10.230
Wait.

36:10.532 --> 36:11.532
Wait.

36:55.002 --> 36:56.771
Get in there.
Now!

38:24.785 --> 38:26.990
Yah, shut the fuck...

38:44.225 --> 38:45.040
No!

38:52.138 --> 38:54.659
God!
God!

39:14.563 --> 39:15.663
Where is Ivo?

39:23.355 --> 39:24.555
You alright?

39:38.688 --> 39:39.788
We lost Ivo.

39:44.352 --> 39:45.750
Why did you leave the camp?

39:46.688 --> 39:47.688
Speak?

39:49.810 --> 39:51.358
I came her to meet a woman.

39:51.736 --> 39:52.870
And where is she?

39:53.020 --> 39:55.090
She did not survive the forrest.

39:57.383 --> 39:59.650
God has punished me for
leaving his monastery.

39:59.763 --> 40:02.563
God, has better things to think of.

40:04.772 --> 40:05.872
Because of you...

40:07.272 --> 40:08.672
one of my men is dead.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.580
If we move, we move now.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.120
How do we know the man
we've come for is not here?

40:21.230 --> 40:23.430
These men are nothing more
than common thieves.

40:26.438 --> 40:28.044
You will lead us to the great marsh.

40:28.046 --> 40:29.346
Sir, I am of no use to you.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.680
You will lead us,

40:33.147 --> 40:34.820
or stay here alone,

40:35.905 --> 40:37.096
and be damned.

41:11.230 --> 41:13.030
The village lies beyond the marsh.

41:13.980 --> 41:15.180
What's the plan?

41:18.178 --> 41:19.740
Identify the heretic,

41:20.950 --> 41:23.910
capture him,
put him in the cage.

41:24.010 --> 41:25.540
That will never go across the marsh.

41:25.540 --> 41:26.865
Then we'll leave it behind!

41:29.035 --> 41:30.220
Drag him here.

42:51.522 --> 42:52.522
Come on, boy.

42:53.355 --> 42:54.357
Come on.

45:12.230 --> 45:13.802
What brings you to our village?

45:17.940 --> 45:19.140
We seek refuge.

45:21.105 --> 45:22.720
A place to rest, nothing more.

45:24.648 --> 45:25.748
Then you are welcome.

45:33.148 --> 45:34.248
My name is Hob.

45:40.480 --> 45:41.482
I am Ulric.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.640
You were attacked?

45:46.565 --> 45:47.665
In the forest.

45:48.107 --> 45:51.707
Then you did well to reach us.
That forest can be dangerous.

45:52.432 --> 45:54.010
May I ask what you were doing?

45:54.260 --> 45:56.028
Bringing relief to the suffering.

45:56.523 --> 45:57.623
Relief?

45:58.690 --> 45:59.771
From what?

46:00.861 --> 46:03.167
Word of the pestilence
has not reached you?

46:03.543 --> 46:05.411
Word is all that has reached us.

46:13.976 --> 46:14.974
Come.

46:18.823 --> 46:20.062
What the hell is going on?

46:21.190 --> 46:23.490
We need guile to draw out
the necromancer.

46:29.590 --> 46:30.760
No one acts...

46:32.130 --> 46:33.330
unless I say so.

46:50.183 --> 46:52.070
Tonight we'll feed you
and give you a bed.

46:52.597 --> 46:55.477
And in the morning we'll escort
you to a safe part of the forrest.

46:55.656 --> 46:56.890
We're not welcome?

46:58.149 --> 46:59.149
Of course.

47:00.155 --> 47:01.570
But why would you stay?

47:07.440 --> 47:08.820
Here is some buckets,

47:09.270 --> 47:10.520
you need to wash.

47:24.690 --> 47:26.790
This is no time to be blinded by grief.

47:39.460 --> 47:40.625
If this is hell,

47:41.378 --> 47:42.710
can't wait for heaven.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.160
You're not bound for heaven, Swire.

47:45.232 --> 47:46.230
Believe me.

48:15.024 --> 48:16.524
I'll tend to your wounds.

48:16.955 --> 48:18.420
I'll tend to your wound.

48:22.628 --> 48:24.128
That needs to be dressed.

48:25.399 --> 48:26.399
Come with me.

48:26.750 --> 48:28.522
Maybe you should get her seeing to.

48:57.441 --> 48:58.441
Where are you from?

48:58.648 --> 49:00.348
From the monastery at Staveley.

49:03.358 --> 49:04.458
You're in mourning.

49:05.157 --> 49:06.430
Is it so obvious?

49:08.524 --> 49:09.824
Was it a woman?

49:11.472 --> 49:13.350
It's no sin to love a woman.

49:14.272 --> 49:15.460
I have sworn to god.

49:15.651 --> 49:18.430
A man needs more than
divine love to sustain him.

49:19.270 --> 49:21.524
And he shouldn't be punished
for wanting it.

49:24.358 --> 49:25.758
Do you have a husband?

49:26.230 --> 49:27.331
My husband is dead.

49:27.950 --> 49:28.950
I'm sorry.

49:32.066 --> 49:33.166
Take off your clothes.

49:35.066 --> 49:36.466
I need to dress your wound.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.856
The pain is going already.

50:12.350 --> 50:14.229
It's extraordinary, the pain is gone.

50:14.545 --> 50:15.900
It is a strong remedy.

50:21.690 --> 50:23.647
May I ask you, how did
your husband die?

50:24.677 --> 50:26.084
Men like you killed him.

50:26.771 --> 50:27.920
Men like me?

50:29.608 --> 50:30.708
Men of God.

51:08.900 --> 51:11.500
This church has not seen
worship for a long while.

51:36.230 --> 51:37.435
The woman you went with...

51:37.671 --> 51:39.571
She dressed my wounds,
nothing more.

51:42.310 --> 51:43.844
Nothing here is what it seems.

51:44.770 --> 51:46.348
You can help us keep warm, girls.

51:51.247 --> 51:52.210
Child.

52:03.359 --> 52:04.359
I found it.

52:05.204 --> 52:06.080
Where?

52:06.170 --> 52:07.421
In the marsh.

52:15.484 --> 52:18.284
Every village we rode through
had graveyards bursting.

52:19.192 --> 52:20.768
No corpse-fueled pits,

52:21.170 --> 52:22.370
no burning bodies.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.795
We cannot judge them,
for having no disease.

52:25.160 --> 52:28.158
A party was send before us
charged with the same task,

52:28.310 --> 52:29.800
four men, none returned.

52:31.234 --> 52:33.134
They were lead by a man like myself.

52:35.484 --> 52:36.710
This symbol,

52:36.950 --> 52:38.910
is worn only by the bishops envoy.

52:40.525 --> 52:42.425
The girl wore its twin.

53:16.900 --> 53:18.437
Please welcome our guests.

53:18.545 --> 53:20.140
What is ours is now yours.

53:20.290 --> 53:21.310
To our guests.

53:21.440 --> 53:22.677
To our guests.

53:23.651 --> 53:25.216
We also want to give thanks,

53:25.210 --> 53:27.595
that we've been spared
the terrible pestilence

53:27.776 --> 53:29.476
sweeping through the land.

53:35.850 --> 53:36.916
If I may...

53:39.526 --> 53:42.426
I would like to express our
gratitude for your welcome.

53:49.734 --> 53:51.034
Now let us pray.

53:51.817 --> 53:55.817
Pater noster qui es in caelis,
sanctificetur nomen tuum.

53:56.276 --> 53:57.976
Adveniat regnum tuum.

53:58.526 --> 53:59.764
Fiat voluntas tua,

54:00.166 --> 54:01.966
sicut in caelo et in terra.

54:02.359 --> 54:04.959
Panem nostrum cotidianum
da nobis hodie.

54:08.317 --> 54:10.536
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra,

54:10.538 --> 54:13.838
sicut et nos dimittimus
debitoribus nostris.

54:16.776 --> 54:18.576
Amen.
Amen.

54:19.526 --> 54:22.626
I expected grace
not the entire Lord's Prayer.

54:32.401 --> 54:33.915
Women outnumber men here.

54:34.917 --> 54:37.317
Maybe that's why a woman
speaks for them.

54:37.943 --> 54:39.043
Do not be fooled.

54:40.901 --> 54:43.901
Evil works within this place,
within these people.

54:58.776 --> 54:59.776
Osmund.

55:02.068 --> 55:03.268
I just need some air.

55:15.776 --> 55:17.276
We found her in the forrest.

55:18.860 --> 55:20.660
She spoke of you before she died.

56:22.235 --> 56:24.135
Forgive me Lord.
I am angry.

56:29.235 --> 56:30.735
Why did you take her?

56:34.943 --> 56:36.443
Why did you take her?

57:09.902 --> 57:11.802
<i>Osmund, where were you?</i>

57:16.735 --> 57:18.135
<i>Why did you betray me?</i>

57:21.110 --> 57:22.110
<i>Why?</i>

57:24.277 --> 57:26.177
<i>Why did you betray me?</i>

57:28.152 --> 57:30.152
<i>Osmund? Osmund?</i>

57:30.694 --> 57:31.694
Osmund.

57:36.027 --> 57:37.027
Osmund?

57:37.444 --> 57:38.586
What troubles you?

57:38.888 --> 57:40.588
We're to become beasts.

57:41.027 --> 57:43.978
We must become more than beasts
if we are to triumph here.

57:44.194 --> 57:48.894
I see no evil here, just a simple
village that has not yet been ravished.

57:49.148 --> 57:51.648
Leave a suffering to your
heart daunt your senses.

57:51.710 --> 57:54.210
Sir, how would you know,
you have no heart to suffer.

57:54.819 --> 57:56.319
I have known grief.

57:57.069 --> 57:59.369
My wife and child sit at God's side.

58:11.527 --> 58:12.527
Yes,

58:13.365 --> 58:15.365
this village is without the pestilence.

58:17.777 --> 58:19.577
But it is also without God.

58:21.485 --> 58:22.655
For this...

58:23.657 --> 58:24.757
they will suffer.

58:54.027 --> 58:55.127
Are you shy?

59:00.694 --> 59:03.394
I am ugly and I am Christian.

59:04.652 --> 59:06.552
And that is not
a good combination in here.

59:08.569 --> 59:09.569
Piss off.

59:28.944 --> 59:30.344
When will she be buried?

59:31.194 --> 59:32.165
Do not worry.

59:32.167 --> 59:33.867
I will take care of everything.

59:34.944 --> 59:36.144
Can I see her again?

59:36.944 --> 59:37.944
You will.

59:48.819 --> 59:51.719
You were going to tell
me these men mean us harm.

59:52.694 --> 59:53.994
Me in particular.

59:55.778 --> 59:58.178
I knew the moment
I looked into Ulric's eyes.

59:59.403 --> 01:00:01.603
But I did not know
with whose side you were on.

01:00:04.236 --> 01:00:05.236
Come with me.

01:00:09.444 --> 01:00:10.444
Come.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.070
What's going on?

01:00:47.278 --> 01:00:48.678
Something you should see.

01:01:14.528 --> 01:01:15.528
Now.

01:03:32.204 --> 01:03:33.204
What's wrong?

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:35.945
Get off.

01:03:52.445 --> 01:03:54.045
Eat and drink.

01:04:09.404 --> 01:04:12.304
As a Christian you'll appreciate
the concept of betrayal.

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:11.050
Together.

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:12.291
Keep your head together.

01:05:12.292 --> 01:05:13.299
Get lost.
Keep it together.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.550
Keep it together.
Get lost.

01:05:14.633 --> 01:05:15.733
Keep your head together.

01:05:18.696 --> 01:05:19.696
Stop!

01:05:19.697 --> 01:05:20.745
Piss off!

01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:22.997
You're not there boy.
Look at me boy.

01:05:22.999 --> 01:05:23.999
Look at me!

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.046
Come on, boy.

01:06:04.654 --> 01:06:05.754
Whore!

01:06:07.279 --> 01:06:09.079
Whore!

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.736
These Christians,

01:06:24.038 --> 01:06:25.908
arrived in our village,

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:28.210
claiming to seek refuge.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.280
This was their true purpose.

01:06:32.696 --> 01:06:36.896
They came uninvited to our
home bringing malice and hatred.

01:06:37.446 --> 01:06:39.946
These are God's gifts to us.

01:06:40.113 --> 01:06:41.613
These are his words.

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.530
And these fine men,
his ambassadors.

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:49.044
Thirteen centuries,

01:06:49.746 --> 01:06:52.046
of control and intimidation.

01:06:52.238 --> 01:06:55.338
Now gaze back at us,
through those bars.

01:07:28.905 --> 01:07:30.705
We do not relish suffering.

01:07:31.405 --> 01:07:33.505
We do what we must,
to keep us safe.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.996
The pestilence,
the Christian disease,

01:07:38.498 --> 01:07:41.598
send by your god
to ravage his own people.

01:07:42.405 --> 01:07:44.330
By spilling your Christian blood,

01:07:44.532 --> 01:07:46.232
the pestilence is kept at bay.

01:07:46.572 --> 01:07:47.786
You and your flock,

01:07:48.088 --> 01:07:50.288
you believe this blasphemous filth?

01:07:50.488 --> 01:07:52.788
Kill us now, you bitch.
Get it over with.

01:07:53.405 --> 01:07:55.505
I will offer you all the chance to live.

01:07:58.197 --> 01:08:00.797
Renounce your vengeful God,
and you will be free.

01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:03.530
Keep him,

01:08:03.558 --> 01:08:04.558
and you will die.

01:08:05.363 --> 01:08:07.763
Not one man here
will bow down to you.

01:08:09.947 --> 01:08:11.445
I will die first.

01:08:11.747 --> 01:08:13.247
Who wants to live?

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:17.395
You?

01:08:17.572 --> 01:08:19.971
I will fight Ulric for the right to die first.

01:08:23.488 --> 01:08:24.488
Choose one.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:55.729
You will renounce.

01:09:00.113 --> 01:09:03.413
I look forward to shagging
your mother's ass in hell.

01:09:04.863 --> 01:09:06.408
My mother is alive,

01:09:06.711 --> 01:09:09.211
and she doesn't relish
the company of soldiers.

01:09:14.447 --> 01:09:15.546
Come on.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:17.479
Come on, men.

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:19.897
Die well my friend.
Oh, I will.

01:09:20.904 --> 01:09:22.205
Come on.

01:09:23.113 --> 01:09:24.661
♪ My lady love and I ♪

01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:26.390

♪ We lived in joyeous sin ♪

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.631
Now you will learn about pain.

01:09:47.322 --> 01:09:49.194
Nothing you can teach me
about pain.

01:09:55.364 --> 01:09:56.792
Don't look. Don't look.

01:09:56.794 --> 01:09:57.794
Hey, look away.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Look away, boy.

01:10:05.581 --> 01:10:06.776
Blood of our blood.

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:10.312
Unholy trinity divine.

01:10:10.864 --> 01:10:12.464
We offer this lamb,

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:14.160
slaughtering down.

01:10:15.614 --> 01:10:18.814
That death not ours
shall stay afar.

01:10:22.031 --> 01:10:23.651
For Christian blood,

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.953
putrid and sick.

01:10:26.906 --> 01:10:28.306
Into our marsh,

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:29.774
shall weep.

01:10:55.198 --> 01:10:56.198
Bitch.

01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:57.287
Bitch!

01:10:57.289 --> 01:10:59.189
I'll fucking kill you bitch!

01:10:59.717 --> 01:11:01.440
I'll slice you open.

01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:02.743
Do you hear me?

01:11:02.948 --> 01:11:05.249
I'll fucking slice you open.

01:11:05.336 --> 01:11:06.310
I don't fuck.

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:15.618
Choose another.

01:11:25.091 --> 01:11:26.263
I will renounce.

01:11:27.406 --> 01:11:28.637
No, No, you won't.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.630
You won't.

01:11:29.864 --> 01:11:31.068
You try to leave this...

01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:33.570
I'll kill you with my bare
fucking hands.

01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:35.583
I swear, I do.

01:11:36.521 --> 01:11:37.604
No.

01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:38.661
Swire, listen to me.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.820
If you renounce, you burn in hell.

01:11:41.223 --> 01:11:44.423
You...
My Friend you'll burn in hell.

01:11:49.365 --> 01:11:50.565
He's going to kill you.

01:11:50.566 --> 01:11:52.166
No for God. No!

01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:54.253
I swear to god,

01:11:54.255 --> 01:11:55.555
they're going to kill you.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:57.820
Swire, stop, no.

01:11:59.068 --> 01:12:01.104
I swear to god,
they're going to kill you.

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.475
God, begone.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:19.670
I do renounce thee eternally.

01:12:25.948 --> 01:12:26.948
God...

01:12:28.038 --> 01:12:29.038
begone.

01:12:29.948 --> 01:12:31.748
I do renounce thee eternally.

01:12:32.365 --> 01:12:34.665
Holy Ghost, begone eternally.

01:12:35.448 --> 01:12:36.548
Holy Ghost...

01:12:37.638 --> 01:12:38.938
begone eternally.

01:12:39.156 --> 01:12:41.556
Christ, begone eternally.

01:12:44.948 --> 01:12:45.948
Christ...

01:12:46.948 --> 01:12:48.448
begone eternally.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:51.015
The false idols have been cast out.

01:12:53.698 --> 01:12:54.798
God is gone.

01:12:56.023 --> 01:12:57.670
The Holy Ghost is gone.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.040
Christ is gone.

01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:05.905
These men,

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:08.188
will escort you to
the edge of the village.

01:13:08.414 --> 01:13:09.646
You are free to go.

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:19.600
Where are we going?

01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:21.134
Where are we going?

01:13:21.298 --> 01:13:22.352
Where are we going?

01:13:22.964 --> 01:13:24.329
Where are we go...

01:13:38.573 --> 01:13:39.573
Osmund.

01:13:40.748 --> 01:13:42.920
You will renounce.
Leave the boy.

01:13:43.496 --> 01:13:44.748
Leave the boy!

01:13:45.448 --> 01:13:47.648
Leave the boy and take a man.

01:13:49.323 --> 01:13:50.623
He's a boy!

01:13:52.324 --> 01:13:53.332
He's a boy!

01:13:53.634 --> 01:13:54.634
He's a boy!

01:14:01.657 --> 01:14:02.826
These monks,

01:14:03.863 --> 01:14:05.720
came to restore our faith.

01:14:07.699 --> 01:14:09.499
Today he will abandon his own.

01:14:11.407 --> 01:14:14.039
Inside that cottage
is the woman he loves.

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:16.057
I've brought her back to him.

01:14:16.804 --> 01:14:18.680
God I am dead, I'm in hell.

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:22.270
No Osmund, you left hell behind
when you crossed our marsh.

01:14:24.324 --> 01:14:25.924
Come live here with us.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:28.625
Come live with the woman you love.

01:14:29.571 --> 01:14:30.910
We have no fury.

01:14:31.783 --> 01:14:33.030
We have no pestilence.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.370
We have no God.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.054
Why are you doing this to me?

01:14:38.456 --> 01:14:39.630
Because I like you.

01:14:45.574 --> 01:14:47.474
Renounce and you will be together.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.654
Go.

01:14:51.929 --> 01:14:52.940
Go.

01:14:57.241 --> 01:14:58.241
Osmund.

01:14:58.332 --> 01:14:59.332
Osmund.

01:14:59.907 --> 01:15:01.207
Do not be tempted.

01:15:02.028 --> 01:15:03.270
It is not her.

01:15:03.487 --> 01:15:04.850
It is not her!

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:07.866
Osmund!

01:15:08.447 --> 01:15:09.530
Osmund!

01:16:16.866 --> 01:16:17.866
Averill.

01:16:23.449 --> 01:16:24.749
No, come here.

01:16:27.158 --> 01:16:28.298
No, Averill.

01:16:44.574 --> 01:16:46.233
Averill, look at me.

01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:57.408
It is alright.

01:16:58.533 --> 01:16:59.633
It's alright.

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:01.733
You're with God.

01:17:02.699 --> 01:17:03.899
You're with God.

01:17:06.158 --> 01:17:08.312
And very soon, I'll be with you.

01:17:08.314 --> 01:17:09.514
I promise you.

01:17:10.533 --> 01:17:11.733
I promise.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:29.050
I love you, Averill.

01:17:32.866 --> 01:17:34.166
In nomine Patris...

01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:36.241
et Filii...

01:17:37.533 --> 01:17:39.195
et Spiritus Sancti.

01:17:39.197 --> 01:17:40.197
Amen.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.250
Averill is with God.

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:07.742
And so am I.

01:19:11.908 --> 01:19:13.908
This shows how cruel they are.

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:17.717
Even the ones they love are
slaughtered in God's name.

01:19:27.617 --> 01:19:29.417
The boy will not renounce.

01:19:29.718 --> 01:19:31.418
The boy will not renounce.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.876
You have no power here.

01:19:34.278 --> 01:19:35.978
You have no power here.

01:19:37.659 --> 01:19:38.659
Hob,

01:19:39.317 --> 01:19:40.517
crucify them all.

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.900
You can not tear a true man of God,

01:19:42.902 --> 01:19:44.402
away from his faith.

01:19:45.492 --> 01:19:47.230
I do not fear you,

01:19:47.632 --> 01:19:49.132
nor your pagan lapdog.

01:19:51.075 --> 01:19:52.075
Finished?

01:19:54.367 --> 01:19:55.667
Bring out the horses.

01:20:07.575 --> 01:20:08.935
Crucify us,

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:11.137
and you shall be spared.

01:20:13.159 --> 01:20:15.239
That is the creed of your witch.

01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:18.259
You came to our land bringing death.

01:20:18.784 --> 01:20:20.384
For once you speak the truth.

01:20:21.659 --> 01:20:23.259
We came bringing death.

01:20:24.576 --> 01:20:26.276
She cannot protect you,

01:20:26.428 --> 01:20:27.828
from God's wrath.

01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:30.161
Repent!

01:20:30.463 --> 01:20:31.963
Before it is too late.

01:20:32.951 --> 01:20:33.951
Hit it.

01:20:34.826 --> 01:20:35.926
Repent!

01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:53.401
You will renounce.

01:20:55.326 --> 01:20:56.326
Never.

01:21:01.409 --> 01:21:03.509
No! No!

01:21:08.201 --> 01:21:09.201
Never.

01:21:36.534 --> 01:21:37.534
Stop!

01:21:51.284 --> 01:21:52.484
Let me see the boy.

01:22:14.951 --> 01:22:16.051
You did well.

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:22.280
Come on, come on, come.

01:22:25.659 --> 01:22:27.359
They will all die by God's hand.

01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:33.334
Open my shirt.

01:22:39.118 --> 01:22:40.418
Open my shirt.

01:22:58.576 --> 01:22:59.676
I am Death.

01:23:02.035 --> 01:23:03.435
Vengeance is mine.

01:23:06.576 --> 01:23:09.776
God's fury rains down on you.

01:23:11.243 --> 01:23:12.643
God is restored.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360
Run.

01:24:05.152 --> 01:24:06.452
Where are you?

01:25:56.052 --> 01:25:57.952
Hell awaits you with open arms.

01:25:58.233 --> 01:25:59.733
There is no hell.

01:26:00.077 --> 01:26:01.554
Well, heaven doesn't want you.

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:03.456
There is no heaven.

01:26:03.764 --> 01:26:04.820
Why?

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.280
Why follow her?

01:26:07.494 --> 01:26:09.094
Because she was beautiful.

01:26:11.244 --> 01:26:12.444
And real.

01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:14.607
This...

01:26:15.869 --> 01:26:17.069
is real.

01:26:26.994 --> 01:26:31.594
There is no God.

01:26:37.161 --> 01:26:38.161
Where are you?

01:26:51.952 --> 01:26:53.152
Where are you?

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.914
Thou shalt not kill.

01:26:58.328 --> 01:26:59.328
Remember?

01:27:01.661 --> 01:27:02.661
Remember?

01:27:03.578 --> 01:27:05.578
Averill was in purgatory.

01:27:06.411 --> 01:27:08.611
Perhaps in your twisted mind.

01:27:09.119 --> 01:27:11.819
Did you never think that
maybe Averill was never dead?

01:27:14.953 --> 01:27:16.652
We found her in the forrest,

01:27:16.654 --> 01:27:18.817
injured but very much alive.

01:27:19.036 --> 01:27:20.536
You know that is not true.

01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:22.275
Yes Osmund,

01:27:22.277 --> 01:27:25.277
Averill was never dead.
She was alive.

01:27:26.911 --> 01:27:28.511
I drugged her.

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:31.453
I drugged her.

01:27:43.994 --> 01:27:44.994
So why...

01:27:45.578 --> 01:27:47.228
Why w...
Why would you do that?

01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:48.430
Why would you bury her?

01:27:48.744 --> 01:27:50.944
Because people need miracles.

01:27:51.494 --> 01:27:54.994
And they worship the miracle makers,
whoever they might be.

01:27:59.786 --> 01:28:02.686
The people in this village
believed in me.

01:28:03.286 --> 01:28:04.734
And so did you.

01:28:04.736 --> 01:28:06.536
No, Averill was dead.

01:28:06.953 --> 01:28:08.353
You killed her.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.620
Averill was dead.

01:28:21.286 --> 01:28:22.386
She was dead.

01:28:29.328 --> 01:28:30.528
Bring her back.

01:28:33.411 --> 01:28:35.411
I beg you, bring her back.

01:28:37.453 --> 01:28:39.453
No, I can't.

01:28:40.578 --> 01:28:42.078
Pray to your God.

01:28:42.995 --> 01:28:44.395
See what he can do.

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:55.628
She was dead.

01:29:22.328 --> 01:29:24.131
<i>There is nothing beautiful,</i>

01:29:24.133 --> 01:29:25.373
<i>or uplifting,</i>

01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:27.275
<i>in returning people to God.</i>

01:29:30.203 --> 01:29:32.703
<i>There is no place
in heaven for those who kill.</i>

01:29:36.287 --> 01:29:37.362
<i>The pestilence,</i>

01:29:37.564 --> 01:29:39.264
<i>claimed no higher purpose.</i>

01:29:40.203 --> 01:29:42.803
<i>And those who had survived
our swords that day.</i>

01:29:43.574 --> 01:29:45.674
<i>Soon fell foul of its sighs.</i>

01:29:47.953 --> 01:29:49.953
<i>They were not protected by the witch.</i>

01:29:51.453 --> 01:29:53.053
<i>They were simply remote.</i>

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:57.120
<i>And once the pestilence
crossed their marsh.</i>

01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:00.020
<i>It killed them too.</i>

01:30:21.079 --> 01:30:22.079
Osmund.

01:30:23.912 --> 01:30:24.912
Osmund.

01:30:27.745 --> 01:30:28.845
We're here.

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:44.620
Osmund.

01:30:48.995 --> 01:30:51.395
That you've returned safe
is a miracle.

01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:55.416
Who is that?

01:30:55.718 --> 01:30:58.518
It's a necromancer that
I'll be delivering to the bishop.

01:31:00.995 --> 01:31:01.995
Here,

01:31:02.572 --> 01:31:03.572
that's it...

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.420
How many of you are left.

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.220
Enough.

01:31:18.662 --> 01:31:19.862
Look after him.

01:31:21.537 --> 01:31:23.037
There's no need.

01:31:24.787 --> 01:31:26.287
He is back with God.

01:31:48.037 --> 01:31:49.437
<i>I never saw him again.</i>

01:31:51.162 --> 01:31:52.362
<i>I heard stories.</i>

01:31:54.329 --> 01:31:55.629
<i>Dark stories.</i>

01:31:57.371 --> 01:31:59.071
<i>That in the years that followed,</i>

01:32:00.076 --> 01:32:01.876
<i>Osmund's heart turned cold.</i>

01:32:03.037 --> 01:32:04.801
<i>That in the shadow of his grief,</i>

01:32:05.503 --> 01:32:07.103
<i>he found a hate.</i>

01:32:07.579 --> 01:32:08.879
<i>And that in God's name...</i>

01:32:09.537 --> 01:32:11.054
<i>he took up the sword</i>

01:32:11.556 --> 01:32:12.765
<i>and vengeance</i>

01:32:13.167 --> 01:32:14.467
<i>became his creed.</i>

01:32:20.996 --> 01:32:22.196
Can I help you?

01:32:40.663 --> 01:32:41.663
Please.

01:32:43.079 --> 01:32:44.079
Please.

01:32:47.163 --> 01:32:48.563
I've done nothing wrong.

01:32:51.663 --> 01:32:52.663
Please.

01:32:53.663 --> 01:32:54.663
Please.

01:32:57.621 --> 01:32:59.221
You have the wrong woman.

01:33:02.746 --> 01:33:04.946
I want a confession
and I want her alive.

01:33:14.347 --> 01:33:15.347
My God.

01:33:30.948 --> 01:33:31.948
Please...

01:33:49.705 --> 01:33:50.705
Osmund.

01:33:51.663 --> 01:33:52.863
She won't confess.

01:33:53.621 --> 01:33:55.021
Are you sure she's a witch?

01:34:02.538 --> 01:34:03.638
Where is she?

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.646
<i>Some say he found the witch,</i>

01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:15.410
<i>and that he tortured her,</i>

01:34:15.585 --> 01:34:16.710
<i>and burned her.</i>

01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:22.518
<i>Others say,</i>

01:34:22.696 --> 01:34:24.020
<i>it was never her,</i>

01:34:27.068 --> 01:34:29.120
<i>it was only her guilt he saw,</i>

01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:30.980
<i>in the eyes of the accused.</i>

01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:59.780
<i>I like to think that he found peace,</i>

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:04.004
<i>that he continued seeing
beauty in the world,</i>

01:35:05.755 --> 01:35:06.930
<i>goodness.</i>

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:16.320
