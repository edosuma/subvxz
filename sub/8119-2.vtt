WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.280
APPLAUSE
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.280 --> 00:21.040
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.040 --> 00:24.120
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

00:30.560 --> 00:31.800
Thanks, Mammy.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.680
Ah, thanks, Mrs Brown.

00:56.160 --> 01:01.200
Still looking, love? Yeah. Nothing.
there's just no jobs going!

01:01.200 --> 01:06.160
And with the baby on the way,
we have to get our own place!

01:06.160 --> 01:08.600
Something will come up.

01:11.160 --> 01:18.240
Hello! Well, there's a new Brown
due. Getting closer every day!

01:18.240 --> 01:22.720
Foot! Foot! I don't care what it is,
as long as it's a girl!

01:25.440 --> 01:27.320
How do I look? I'm on a diet.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.720
Yes, it's called the
Cook And Kids diet.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.400
I cook toast
and the kids feckin' eat it!

01:34.480 --> 01:36.320
I'm serious, listen.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.760
Maria, put some bread in that
toaster!

01:38.760 --> 01:40.680
Oh God, no more toast for me,
Mrs Brown.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.360
See? It wouldn't be for me.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.160
I don't feckin' eat toast.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.840
See ya later, pussycat!

01:47.840 --> 01:50.720
Your shoe? Where's your other shoe?
The other shoe?

01:50.720 --> 01:52.240
Shoo! Shoo!

01:52.240 --> 01:54.720
Your other... Ah, feckin' hop!

01:57.400 --> 02:00.080
Mammy, what would it be like to
work in a lighthouse?

02:00.080 --> 02:01.640
A lighthouse?

02:01.640 --> 02:04.880
You'd have to run around in a circle
to read your book.

02:06.240 --> 02:11.560
And you'd have crabs all over your
rocks! It would be worse than your
holiday in Malaga.

02:11.560 --> 02:18.200
Ah no, seriously, Mammy.
I have to get a better job.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.960
A lighthouse?

02:19.960 --> 02:23.560
Well you'd be lonely -
and you could be away for weeks!

02:24.720 --> 02:27.080
No, three days a week.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.600
Three days a week,
in a lighthouse?

02:29.600 --> 02:31.360
Where's this lighthouse?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.400
Birmingham.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.840
Show me the ad.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.800
"Person wanted, three days
a week for light house work."

02:39.800 --> 02:46.920
You feckin' eejit!
No wonder you can't get a job.
You feckin' eejit!

02:46.920 --> 02:51.240
Who's an eejit? Your brother!
You'll get no argument from me.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.000
Well thank you, Dr Spock.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.560
Don't slap your brother,
you'll hurt him! You did!

02:56.560 --> 03:00.000
I'm allowed, it's my job.
Thanks, Mammy.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.520
Oh, and don't count me in for dinner.
I'm meeting Mick! He's going on a
course for special detectives!

03:05.520 --> 03:07.120
And is he, Cathy? Is he special?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.400
He could be the one.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.920
I used to call
your father that, the one.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.920
Awww!

03:11.920 --> 03:13.120
One bastard.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.960
It would be nice if it worked
out for her, wouldn't it?

03:18.960 --> 03:21.360
Yeah, great! That's all we need.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.600
A copper in the family!

03:22.600 --> 03:24.920
Mammy, Did you see my blue
canvas shoes?

03:24.920 --> 03:28.200
Ah now, where did I leave them
after me ballet classes?

03:28.200 --> 03:31.600
I'd wear these,
I suppose they'll do.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.040
You suppose they'll do?

03:33.040 --> 03:36.360
When I was a child you were lucky
if you had one pair of shoes.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.920
Here we go.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.240
Don't make light of it.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.680
I got up every morning
and walked 6 miles to school.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.920
7 miles to the nearest shop.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.600
4 miles just to go to mass.
You should have moved!

03:49.600 --> 03:53.080
Don't be cheeky, son!
And, you - watch the time!

03:53.080 --> 03:57.400
Toast! Give me that feckin' toast,
give me that!

04:03.640 --> 04:05.240
Get out! Get out!

04:08.080 --> 04:11.240
Are you making toast there, Mammy?
What am I, the Toast Master?

04:11.240 --> 04:15.800
I'm not going to be making
toast for every Tom, Dick and Harry
that walks into this house!

04:15.800 --> 04:19.920
Morning, Mammy.
Good morning, Trevor son! Toast?

04:21.160 --> 04:22.560
Yeah, I'd love some!

04:27.160 --> 04:28.680
Right, I'm off.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.800
Be careful, son -
it's a jungle out there!

04:36.800 --> 04:40.000
Trevor, you should go up
and visit Father Quinn,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.600
you haven't seen him
since you got home.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.200
Mammy... And, I've done all your
washing. It's folded up nicely just

04:46.200 --> 04:47.520
right beside your bed.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.320
And you should get yourself into
town, get yourself a decent
pair of feckin' shoes!

04:52.320 --> 04:54.040
I have to go back to the mission.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.360
I know.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.360
When?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.280
This week. South Sudan.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.360
Not South Sudan!

05:02.360 --> 05:04.080
Do you know where that is?

05:04.080 --> 05:05.840
No.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.360
Mammy, it was great to be home,
but you always knew it would be
a short visit.

05:09.360 --> 05:13.080
Well, we'll give you a good feckin'
send off! No, you won't.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.120
Not like the last time,
no big party, no brass band,

05:17.120 --> 05:19.720
no big deal, and no tears!

05:19.720 --> 05:22.440
Jacko has an erection!

05:30.760 --> 05:34.400
An erection? Just like that?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.240
Just like that!

05:38.240 --> 05:43.040
He's lying there in the hospital,
his bed like a tent!

05:44.680 --> 05:48.280
Apparently it's a side effect of the
medication he's on for his heart.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.160
You must have got a shock!
I thought he was dead.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.440
I thought it was rigor mortis!

05:58.520 --> 06:01.040
Do you ever miss it, Agnes?
Miss what?

06:01.040 --> 06:03.160
You know. It.
The humpy-humpy thing?

06:04.720 --> 06:05.760
No.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.360
Not even a little bit?
Not even a teensy weensy bit.
What's to feckin' miss?

06:09.360 --> 06:12.960
The smell of Guinness and chips
being breathed all over you?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.600
His chin like feckin' sandpaper?

06:17.480 --> 06:22.640
Taking advantage of me
whenever he liked - he'd come in
and dive on me, "AHHHHHH!

06:22.640 --> 06:28.160
"Take off me feckin' tights!"

06:30.240 --> 06:36.720
And all I could do was lie there and
try and keep me place in the book.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.840
The answer is no, Winnie.
I don't miss it one little bit!

06:41.840 --> 06:43.520
Ah, Agnes, you're gas!

06:43.520 --> 06:45.680
Here, I'm going to go.

06:45.680 --> 06:51.720
I might pop down to the hospital and
see if Jacko's any better.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.200
Or any bigger!

06:53.200 --> 06:57.080
Speaking of balls,
bingo at eight o'clock!

06:57.080 --> 06:58.800
See you, love!
See you later!

06:58.800 --> 07:01.720
Hello, Mrs McGoogan. Hello, son.
How are you, Mrs McGoogan?

07:01.720 --> 07:09.400
Look what the cat dragged in.
What the cat dragged!
Ah, feck off!

07:09.400 --> 07:11.480
Just home for a quick cuppa!

07:11.480 --> 07:17.640
Well here, help yourselves.
I have to get Grandad ready for
sports day for the old folks' home.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.360
He's entered in the long spit!

07:25.000 --> 07:30.520
I'm telling you, Dermot, it's
foolproof. The house is full of gear
and there's nobody there.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.440
Nobody? They own a circus

07:32.440 --> 07:35.280
and they pack up every winter
and go away until Easter.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.960
Circus people, Dermo. You know what
they're like for jewellery.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.480
Maria wouldn't like this.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.600
Don't bring her.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.720
All right.
Ah, fantastic!

07:48.720 --> 07:51.120
But they have cameras.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.520
Leave it to me.
I'll get another costume from work!

07:55.520 --> 07:57.680
Ah, Dermo - just like the old days!

07:57.680 --> 08:00.880
You and me like prowling cats,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.160
silent and invisible.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.960
CRASHING

08:07.960 --> 08:10.880
Ahhhhh! I'm OK!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.760
Buster, you look great! Come in!

08:26.400 --> 08:28.480
I think me ma's gone to the bingo!

08:28.480 --> 08:29.680
Who's that?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.080
Nobody!

08:32.320 --> 08:34.720
Hide! It's me, Mammy.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.600
Hello, son. Nice pyjamas.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.640
Grandad, I'm off to the bingo.

08:45.600 --> 08:51.080
Grandad - it's over! It's over!

08:51.080 --> 08:57.960
Look, I know you are disappointed
with second place, but there's
always next year.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.080
If you're still here!

09:03.080 --> 09:06.480
Dermot, I'm off!
Good luck at the bingo!

09:06.480 --> 09:10.760
We have to make this quick.
I need to be back before Maria
finishes her shift.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.400
Come on, let's go.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
What are you giggling about?

09:19.600 --> 09:23.880
You today, keeping
your place in the book!

09:23.880 --> 09:24.920
It's true!

09:24.920 --> 09:27.000
But making love, Agnes!

09:27.000 --> 09:31.320
Love, my arse! Making more worries,
making shitty nappies.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.960
Makin' HIM happy!
And you! Making you happy, too!

09:35.960 --> 09:38.880
Ah, Jesus, Agnes, you can't tell me
you've never enjoyed it.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.440
Winnie, are you on drugs?
Enjoy what?

09:43.440 --> 09:45.960
You know, the organism.

09:57.720 --> 10:02.640
I never done one. I nearly did,
once. Not with him.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.920
Mary Murphy
told me to get a cucumber.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.680
I went down to the vegetable shop
to get it. The man said,

10:11.680 --> 10:15.800
"Will I slice it?" I said,
"Excuse me, it's a fanny not
a feckin' parking meter!"

10:23.680 --> 10:25.000
I don't think they exist!

10:25.000 --> 10:29.480
Oh, they do, Agnes, I swear it!
I done two.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.880
When?

10:31.880 --> 10:34.720
Well, one two weeks
after your Redser's funeral.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.000
BOTH: Lord rest him!

10:37.000 --> 10:39.560
On a Friday.
And one the following August.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.640
And what were they like?

10:43.640 --> 10:46.280
Massive! Brilliant!

10:47.440 --> 10:49.640
Be specific, describe it!

10:49.640 --> 10:53.000
Well, at first, I didn't know what
was goin' on.

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
He was floppin' up and down like a
dying whale, flip flop, flip flop,
flip flop, flip flop! Winnie!

11:00.000 --> 11:03.840
I know that bit, get to the part
where you feckin' harpoon him.

11:09.520 --> 11:14.240
Well, there's me thinkin' to meself,
"Jesus, if this fella doesn't..."

11:14.240 --> 11:15.720
Yes. I know.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.120
"..I'll fall asleep."

11:17.120 --> 11:20.160
If you were awake to start with!

11:20.160 --> 11:25.720
Then suddenly, oh, I had this
feeling. A wave came over me.

11:25.720 --> 11:26.880
Tsunami?

11:28.920 --> 11:32.840
It was like getting ten early
numbers at the bingo, Agnes.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.640
And you just knew something
good was coming!

11:35.640 --> 11:37.720
Ten early numbers!

11:41.400 --> 11:45.840
A shiver ran down me body, me hips
started jerking all on their own.

11:47.600 --> 11:53.720
Oh, I closed me eyes -
it was like an explosion.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.720
I could see colours bursting in me
mind like fireworks.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.800
And without me telling it to,

12:04.800 --> 12:08.400
me voice gave out a little
yelp, "Arghhhh!"

12:10.800 --> 12:13.040
It's OK, it's OK! It's OK!

12:15.200 --> 12:18.000
Winnie! You frightened the
shite out of me!

12:18.000 --> 12:19.600
Sorry.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.400
He just stopped and said,
"Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."

12:26.600 --> 12:29.160
Oh, I could hardly speak.

12:29.160 --> 12:34.000
"Oh, keep going!"
You know, I kinda whispered.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.880
But he just rolled over
and said, "You're all right, love,
I wasn't in the mood anyway."

12:39.880 --> 12:41.400
He was asleep in seconds.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.560
Gone!

12:42.560 --> 12:46.040
I just lay there, Agnes.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.720
And I don't know why,
but I started to cry.

12:49.720 --> 12:54.600
Now, I wasn't sad or nothing.
I just cried.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.600
Well that's it, love.
What do you think?

13:03.080 --> 13:05.600
Was that the first one or
the second one?

13:05.600 --> 13:08.920
Both. They were the same, only on
the second one I didn't cry.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.000
Did you tell him about them?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.040
Jesus, Agnes, I couldn't tell him.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.360
I'd been faking them
the last 30 years!

13:19.320 --> 13:22.240
Me too! I used to just go...

13:25.400 --> 13:26.600
What did you do?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.280
"Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!"

13:31.840 --> 13:34.120
Here, I need a fag after that!

13:34.120 --> 13:36.760
Winnie! What?
How long did they last?

13:36.760 --> 13:39.960
Seconds. Over in a flash.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.280
If they're that quick, I could have
had loads of them and just not know!

13:43.280 --> 13:49.160
Don't you kid yourself, Agnes Brown.
If you'd had one you'd know it
for sure. Believe you me!

13:50.400 --> 13:53.920
Oooh! Oh, yes!

13:57.760 --> 14:02.040
Well, thank you, Redser Brown.
Leaving me with six orphans

14:02.040 --> 14:04.880
and not one fuckin' organism
to show for it.

14:08.480 --> 14:13.800
I just can't, that's it.
I'm sorry, Professor.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.640
I can do anything else,
but I can't do this!

14:18.760 --> 14:19.920
Can't do what, Cathy?

14:19.920 --> 14:22.520
It's just a project for college.
It's nothing.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.080
I'm not doing it anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.560
What kind of project?
Don't give up so easy!

14:28.560 --> 14:31.000
Oh, a family group session!

14:31.000 --> 14:34.280
What's the problem? You've the
family right here under the roof.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.360
We're getting together tomorrow for
Trevor's send off, it's the
perfect opportunity.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.560
I'll tell everybody half-past seven.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.960
What a lovely way to send Trevor
off but with a family group night!

14:44.960 --> 14:47.240
But, Mammy, I know
everybody too well.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.880
I'll have nothing to work with!

14:48.880 --> 14:51.400
Of course you will. Goodnight, love!

14:53.240 --> 14:55.160
Who's that?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.640
Shhhh! Is everyone in bed?

14:59.640 --> 15:00.720
Yes.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.040
Come on, Buster. Take your time.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.280
Where have you been?

15:04.280 --> 15:06.320
In Emergency at the hospital!

15:06.320 --> 15:08.200
Oh, God. What happened?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.440
Long story.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.120
Come on, Buster, one step at a time.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.040
We had a run-in with
a real live lion!

15:17.040 --> 15:19.560
You had a run-in with a lion,
dressed as a zebra?

15:19.560 --> 15:21.680
Their favourite food!

15:21.680 --> 15:24.800
The lion wasn't hungry.
He was horny!

15:44.160 --> 15:48.400
Nothing to work with?
You must be feckin' joking.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.960
You can sit in with us if you like.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.840
BOTH: No thanks, Mrs Brown.

15:56.840 --> 16:00.440
I suppose not,
you're not really family.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.320
Are we starting or what?

16:02.320 --> 16:04.440
Dermot's not here yet.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.880
Can't we start without him?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.880
It's Cathy's night, I'd leave it to
her! OK.

16:07.880 --> 16:12.200
Now, what Cathy's going to do first
is explain to everybody

16:12.200 --> 16:14.600
exactly what's going on.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.160
Cathy Brown!

16:16.160 --> 16:17.880
You don't have to introduce me.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.880
Cathy Brown!

16:22.000 --> 16:26.040
OK, the basic structure of any
normal family...

16:26.040 --> 16:27.840
Or ours.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.560
Cathy Brown.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.920
The basic structure is identical
for every family, human or animal.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.040
Animals! Ha! I do animals!
Wait till you see it.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.480
SHE CLUCKS

16:43.760 --> 16:47.280
Watch this! What's that?

16:47.280 --> 16:48.320
A chicken?

16:48.320 --> 16:52.080
Yes! Well done, son!
Will I do a pig?

16:52.080 --> 16:54.880
Yes. "Is that feckin' car taxed?"

17:00.080 --> 17:07.800
This structure is called the
hierarchy structure. The father at
the top of the hierarchy.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.720
LAUGHS

17:11.640 --> 17:13.920
Cathy Brown!

17:15.040 --> 17:18.520
The father at the top and the
youngest child at the bottom.

17:18.520 --> 17:22.760
And no matter what age they are,
once the family
gathers in a group situation,

17:22.760 --> 17:27.640
everybody unconsciously reverts to
their place within that structure.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.640
I'd like to use this session to
confirm that theory.

17:30.640 --> 17:37.160
So this is a family group talk,
you just say whatever you like.
All right? Mammy?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.360
Mammy fuckin' bored now.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.320
OK. We'll start with you, Mark.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.080
What? Why me?

17:48.080 --> 17:52.080
Well, we have to start somewhere,
and in the absence of a father

17:52.080 --> 17:54.040
you're the eldest.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.480
All right - my name is Mark Brown
and I'm an alcoholic.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.400
Look, if you're not going to take
this serious then there's no point.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.760
I think being an alcoholic
is feckin' serious!

18:11.320 --> 18:13.280
He's not an alcoholic, Mammy.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.480
Jesus Christ, Cathy - you're
so... And it's not funny!

18:18.720 --> 18:21.120
You're so quick to judge.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.480
He's not, Mammy! Are you, Mark?
No!

18:23.480 --> 18:25.440
There!

18:27.280 --> 18:30.680
So, Mark. How was your day today?

18:30.680 --> 18:32.320
Grand.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.440
Oh, for God's sake!

18:33.440 --> 18:34.840
Were you drinking, son?

18:36.720 --> 18:40.320
He is not an alcoholic, Mammy.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.480
Only an alcoholic denies
he's an alcoholic!

18:46.000 --> 18:49.600
Look, what I'm trying to do here is
just make small talk.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.640
Small talk.
Yeah, to sort of relax everybody.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.320
Chill. Cool, baby, chill!

18:56.200 --> 19:00.160
We can talk about things that
might be worrying us.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.480
Exactly!

19:04.280 --> 19:07.160
No, you don't have to
raise your hand.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.640
If you feel like speaking you just
speak. Go on, Rory.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.520
Dino has a verruca.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.960
Rory, what the
hell are you talking about?

19:16.960 --> 19:20.320
No, wait, Mark. Has he, Rory?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.240
That's very interesting.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.120
I'm on the edge of me buckin' seat!

19:26.240 --> 19:28.880
I can't wait for Verruca 2!

19:30.520 --> 19:34.360
It's not the verruca
that's interesting, Mammy,

19:34.360 --> 19:36.600
it's the fact that Rory said it.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.880
I feckin' heard him.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.960
I am not buckin' deaf!

19:48.520 --> 19:49.840
Cathy Brown.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.760
Why did you pick that particular
thing to start with, Rory?

19:58.760 --> 20:00.440
Because you told me to speak.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.160
Good answer, son!

20:02.160 --> 20:07.560
Yes, but why Dino's verruca?
Does it bother you? Erm...

20:07.560 --> 20:12.520
Answer the fuckin' question!
It's a simple question!
Answer the question!

20:12.520 --> 20:17.840
You give me 30 seconds - I'll get
you an answer. Trevor, get me the
hose off the washing machine!

20:17.840 --> 20:19.920
Mammy!

20:22.040 --> 20:23.880
I'm just doing good cop, bad cop.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.160
You're going down, perp! No deals.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.280
15 to life! CSI Miami!

20:32.280 --> 20:35.600
There's no need for any of that,
Mammy, so stop it!

20:39.160 --> 20:46.480
You see, the interesting thing here
is that a verruca is a niggling
thing. Niggling.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.480
Something that doesn't bother
you for a long time.
Ah, years, yeah.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.920
And then suddenly gets very sore.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.800
Yes! Throbbing! Throbbing!

20:55.800 --> 20:57.200
Was Dino throbbing?

21:01.680 --> 21:04.160
Rory, is there
something niggling at you?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.760
Cathy could be right, love!

21:06.760 --> 21:09.280
Take off your shoe -
I'll have a look.

21:09.280 --> 21:14.040
No, Mammy, I mean something
bigger than a verruca!
Like a bunion?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.120
Oh, for Christ's sake.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.880
Sorry I'm late!

21:18.880 --> 21:21.680
It's all right, son,
you missed feck all!

21:23.280 --> 21:25.320
Cathy Brown.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.800
You people just don't get it, do you?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.640
ALL: No.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.280
All right, here's an exercise!

21:32.280 --> 21:35.680
Come on, all of you
do this. Come on!

21:35.680 --> 21:37.880
# Hallelujah! #

21:37.880 --> 21:43.160
All right, now I want everybody to
reach into your past!

21:43.160 --> 21:45.840
Reach into the past.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.880
Cathy, if we're reaching into the
past why are we going forward?

21:49.880 --> 21:52.600
Because I said so and I know what I'm
doing - OK. Reach!

21:52.600 --> 21:55.360
Rory, your past is not
that long. Get back!

21:55.360 --> 21:59.920
Reach in. Cathy, I am
reaching into the bag of my life.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.080
Well done! I am rummaging through
the sack of my memories.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.880
That's it. Jeez, I didn't know that
was there! Oh, no!

22:05.880 --> 22:08.360
You wouldn't believe what's
in here!

22:08.360 --> 22:09.960
Mammy, concentrate, will you!

22:09.960 --> 22:12.080
I am! OK.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.640
Now, I want you to find that
something that holds you back.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.000
Yank it out! Shake it at the world

22:19.000 --> 22:22.040
and say,
"Fuck off and leave me alone!"

22:24.640 --> 22:28.480
I'm cured. I am cured!

22:28.480 --> 22:30.280
Mammy, sit down!

22:34.760 --> 22:36.360
Cathy Brown.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.840
Mammy, the reason I want you to
reach into your past...

22:39.840 --> 22:42.360
Me bag.
..is so that you can understand...

22:42.360 --> 22:45.840
Understand. ..the way you feel...
The way you feel.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.320
..today! Today!

22:48.320 --> 22:51.040
What is she buckin' talking about?

22:53.400 --> 23:00.680
All right, I'll give you an example.
Mark, when I was nine you tore
my communion dress.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.280
Ahh, not the fuckin'
communion dress!

23:04.280 --> 23:09.360
You bring this up at every family
gathering, you ruined your father's
funeral with this!

23:09.360 --> 23:12.120
And everyone was having
such a good time.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.280
You know, I remember your father's
last words.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.520
"Ah, fuck. It's a bus"

23:30.800 --> 23:32.720
Cathy Brown!

23:32.720 --> 23:37.600
Mark,
that dress was important to me.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.960
OK, but I was only 12!

23:39.960 --> 23:41.520
Well, I hated you for that.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.560
Fair enough. I forgive you.

23:43.560 --> 23:46.160
Good boy.
You forgive me for what?

23:46.160 --> 23:49.080
You said you hated me.
I forgive you.

23:49.080 --> 23:52.040
He has a heart of gold! But you're
the one who's in the wrong!

23:52.040 --> 23:56.320
Excuse me! Now, excuse me! He
forgives you and he's in the wrong?

23:56.320 --> 23:59.680
What kind of jumped up feckin'
cycle-ology is this?

23:59.680 --> 24:03.320
You walk in here -
you accuse him of being an alcoholic

24:03.320 --> 24:06.560
and then you won't accept his
forgiveness over one little tear?

24:06.560 --> 24:09.600
And you don't even attack
Rory for wearing the feckin' dress!

24:13.760 --> 24:16.200
Look it...it's all his fault!

24:16.200 --> 24:18.160
I'm not even sure it is a verruca!

24:18.160 --> 24:21.800
Rory! Shut up about
the feckin' verruca!

24:21.800 --> 24:23.920
Don't speak to my son like that.

24:23.920 --> 24:28.040
Ah, Mammy, shut up! And don't you
speak to your mother like that!

24:28.040 --> 24:32.040
This is a waste of time,
you know, forget it. Just forget it!

24:32.040 --> 24:33.160
DOORBELL RINGS

24:33.160 --> 24:34.400
Trevor, get that door!

24:34.400 --> 24:39.280
I'm glad my husband is not alive to
see this, to see his beautiful wife
being treated like this.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.200
Mammy, your husband didn't die.
He's just hiding on you!

24:43.200 --> 24:45.520
You're supposed to
be in control of this.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.800
I wouldn't put
you in control of cattle!

24:47.800 --> 24:50.880
Well, it's not my fault
my family are idiots!

24:50.880 --> 24:53.280
Well it's not my fault you
haven't got a penis!

24:57.560 --> 24:58.960
She hasn't - has she?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.440
Eurgh!

25:00.440 --> 25:04.760
Oh, hiya, Mick, what a surprise!
Give me a minute, I'll get my coat.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.560
No, Cathy. I'm on duty!

25:06.560 --> 25:07.800
And who is she?

25:09.920 --> 25:12.520
He's on duty, Mammy. He's working!

25:12.520 --> 25:15.760
Sorry, I thought he said Judy!
Duty!

25:15.760 --> 25:17.720
Actually, I'm here to see Dermot.

25:17.720 --> 25:20.000
Dermot? For what?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.040
Can I speak to you in private?

25:22.040 --> 25:26.040
Anything you have to say to him can
be said right here - we're
all family.

25:26.040 --> 25:29.960
Yes, we're all family.
Well, not them two, really!
They're not really...

25:29.960 --> 25:32.760
Maria, maybe I should talk to
Mick in the kitchen.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.920
Good idea,
everybody into the kitchen.

25:34.920 --> 25:40.200
No. Here. Now what is it,
Detective O'Leary?

25:40.200 --> 25:42.080
How did you know his name
was O'Leary?

25:42.080 --> 25:44.440
Because I recognise him
from the hospital.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.680
Oh, I've met him a couple of times,
in the children's clinic.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.920
She said that before - yes.
Now what do you want here?

25:51.920 --> 25:55.680
Erm, I'm investigating an attempted
break-in at a warehouse in
Portmarnock,

25:55.680 --> 25:57.080
last Friday evening. Jesus!

25:57.080 --> 26:00.280
Two men fitting
the description of Dermot Brown

26:00.280 --> 26:04.600
and one Buster Brady were
seen at the scene with a truck.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.520
At what time? 11:30.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.240
It couldn't have been my husband,
he was with me. Where?

26:10.240 --> 26:14.240
Here, they were here. Everyone in
your feckin' book,
they were all here.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.760
I went to bed at about 12 o'clock.
I had to, the place was
feckin' packed!

26:18.760 --> 26:23.440
Fellas with balaclavas over there
and fellas with stockings over their
heads over there, it was chaos!

26:23.440 --> 26:26.640
Mammy, they were here!
That's what I said!

26:26.640 --> 26:30.120
And would you both swear to that in
court? I would, twice.

26:30.120 --> 26:34.760
Dermot Brown was having
a night in with his wife,

26:34.760 --> 26:38.200
Detective O'Leary. Maybe you should
try doing the same yourself.

26:44.320 --> 26:49.480
Right, well...that's that then.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.680
Cathy, I can explain...
Don't!

26:57.720 --> 27:00.160
She's not very clear.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.600
Fuck off!

27:09.320 --> 27:14.360
"Family Group Session. What exactly
does the word family mean?

27:16.400 --> 27:19.280
"To take a cynical view,

27:19.280 --> 27:23.240
"the bonds of family can be the very
bonds that hold you back.

27:25.520 --> 27:30.240
"However, they are also the bonds
that support you, keep you

27:30.240 --> 27:36.560
"grounded, and teach you that
above everything else -
family is a place."

27:36.560 --> 27:40.600
"A place in your heart, a place where
no matter what troubles you
encounter,

27:40.600 --> 27:45.800
"no matter where you find yourself,
you know in that place you will
always be loved."

27:47.040 --> 27:48.800
I read it this morning.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.600
I'll miss you

27:51.600 --> 27:53.200
I hope so.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.880
Goodbye, Grandad!

27:56.880 --> 27:59.000
Which one are you?

28:00.640 --> 28:02.520
The nun!

28:02.520 --> 28:05.120
Oh, right.
