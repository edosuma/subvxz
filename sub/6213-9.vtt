WEBVTT

00:03.604 --> 00:06.206
Hey, what's going on here?

00:06.206 --> 00:06.840
Two minutes ago

00:06.840 --> 00:09.009
there were half a dozen
gingerbread men on this tray,

00:09.009 --> 00:10.511
and now there's only one.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.012
( <i>belches</i> )

00:12.012 --> 00:13.347
Got milk?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.082
Got magic.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.851
Hi, Sabrina.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.021
Hi. Hey, gingerbread cookies,
my favorite.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.089
There you go.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.525
Hey, happy birthday, baby.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.093
Wow, a sleazy talking cookie.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.694
You guys are too good to me.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.631
Once again, not enough sugar
and too much attitude.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.498
COOKIE:
Ouch!

00:31.498 --> 00:33.734
Listen, I know it's usually
just us at my birthday dinner

00:33.734 --> 00:35.769
but would it be okay
if I invited Josh this year?

00:35.769 --> 00:38.038
Hey, it would be my pleasure
to open my home

00:38.038 --> 00:41.008
to the ungrateful employee
who quit on me with no notice.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.343
What she means is
it would be our pleasure

00:43.343 --> 00:44.745
to have Josh for dinner.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.346
Good, 'cause I already told him
he could come.

00:46.346 --> 00:46.980
See you tomorrow.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.649
( <i>muffled yelling</i> )

00:48.649 --> 00:51.451
He's even more
annoying muzzled.

00:52.152 --> 00:52.920
( <i>shrill ringing</i> )

00:52.920 --> 00:54.254
Speaking of annoying.

00:56.056 --> 00:56.790
( <i>shrill ringing continues</i> )

00:56.790 --> 00:59.793
Icicles. That can only be
Great-Aunt Irma.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.328
Who's Aunt Irma?

01:01.328 --> 01:03.030
Matriarch of the
Spellman clan

01:03.030 --> 01:05.532
and dreaded holy terror
of the Other Realm.

01:05.532 --> 01:06.967
Answer it, Hilda.

01:06.967 --> 01:10.637
Me? You're the oldest...
and the prettiest.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.308
Too late.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.676
Aunt Irma, what a...

01:15.676 --> 01:17.077
Silence!
( <i>thunder crashes</i> )

01:17.077 --> 01:18.178
Okay, you talk.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.646
I've just learned that Sabrina

01:19.646 --> 01:23.517
has revealed she's a witch
to a mortal named Harvey Kinkle.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.018
Where have you been, toots?

01:25.018 --> 01:26.486
That's old news.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.988
Hilda, Zelda

01:27.988 --> 01:30.557
this was an appalling error
in judgment

01:30.557 --> 01:33.093
for which I hold you
both responsible.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.796
But I assure you, Harvey's
completely trustworthy.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.631
Silence!

01:37.631 --> 01:40.500
I will determine
if the boy is trustworthy.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.303
Have Sabrina bring him here
tomorrow for the inquisition.

01:43.303 --> 01:46.473
Inquisition? But tomorrow
is Sabrina's birthday.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.710
Perfect.
12 hours of interrogation

01:49.710 --> 01:51.712
followed by a sheet cake.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.547
( <i>cackling</i> )

01:54.848 --> 01:55.882
Oh, my God.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.684
With Aunt Irma
interrogating Harvey

01:57.684 --> 02:01.021
we can't have Josh here
for Sabrina's birthday.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.656
Who's going to break
the bad news to her?

02:02.656 --> 02:04.324
Not it!
Not it!

02:07.828 --> 02:14.968
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

02:14.968 --> 02:20.741
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

02:20.741 --> 02:24.311
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

02:45.065 --> 02:46.933
I can't wait to spend
your birthday with you.

02:46.933 --> 02:49.369
I'm giving you your first
present early.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.371
Ooh, and you saved
on gift wrap.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.372
I should get going.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.007
The people at work think
I just stepped away

02:54.007 --> 02:55.275
to go to the bathroom.

02:55.275 --> 02:56.243
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.145
Looking forward to it.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.447
He can't come.

03:00.447 --> 03:01.581
Instead, you have
to bring Harvey

03:01.581 --> 03:02.315
to your birthday dinner

03:02.315 --> 03:03.617
and instead of
eating dinner

03:03.617 --> 03:05.652
Harvey will be
put on trial.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.586
No biggie.

03:06.586 --> 03:07.554
Big biggie!

03:07.554 --> 03:10.223
Followed by a humongous "Huh?"

03:10.223 --> 03:11.324
Your Great Aunt Irma--

03:11.324 --> 03:13.326
and by "great" I mean
horrendously evil--

03:13.326 --> 03:15.862
found out that
you told Harvey
that you're a witch.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.831
Technically, I didn't tell
Harvey I was a witch.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.299
He found out on his own.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.934
Aunt Irma's not one
for subtleties.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.935
She's coming tomorrow

03:21.935 --> 03:23.503
and we're all in
deep donkey dung

03:23.503 --> 03:25.806
if she doesn't think
Harvey can keep the secret.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.708
Come on, Aunt Hilda.
We're family.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.409
What's the worst
she would do to us?

03:29.409 --> 03:30.777
Ask her daughter Phyllis.

03:30.777 --> 03:34.414
She told a morta
that she's a witch and...

03:34.414 --> 03:37.484
she's been wearing
that tutu for 300 years.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.218
On second thought

03:38.218 --> 03:39.653
you know,why would I want to
spend my birthday

03:39.653 --> 03:42.989
with the guy I care
most about in the world?

03:45.759 --> 03:47.427
Okay, guys, here's
the menu for tomorrow:

03:47.427 --> 03:50.163
spaghetti, corn
and bread.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.965
You have a special guest
coming from out of town

03:51.965 --> 03:53.967
and you're making
three starches?

03:53.967 --> 03:55.535
It's called comfort food.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.338
It's called the only food
she knows how to cook.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.806
Hey, it's a free dinner.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.541
It is free, isn't it?

04:01.541 --> 04:03.710
( <i>phone rings</i> )

04:03.710 --> 04:04.678
Hello.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.346
Hey, Isaac. Ok, here's
the plan:

04:06.346 --> 04:07.314
We're going to eat dinner

04:07.314 --> 04:08.615
and then we're going to go
down to the soup kitchen

04:08.615 --> 04:10.183
to volunteer and then...

04:10.183 --> 04:11.551
What can you bring
for dinner?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.720
Uh...I guess we could use some
potatoes.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.690
All right,
see you at 7:00.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.392
So, tell us
about your friend Isaac.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.161
Actually, he's
my ex-boyfiend.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.263
And I don't want to make
a big deal out of this

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
but he's Isaac Hanson.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.767
You know, of Hanson?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.635
You mean, the all-natural
soda people?

04:28.635 --> 04:30.904
No, the rock group.

04:30.904 --> 04:31.972
But when I dated him

04:31.972 --> 04:34.274
he was a guy with
a secondhand guitar
and Hyundai.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.676
Oh, then he became famous

04:36.676 --> 04:39.880
realized he could do better
and dumped you. Whew!

04:39.880 --> 04:42.015
Once again, my world
makes sense.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.451
Wow, what are the odds
of a rock star

04:44.451 --> 04:46.586
spending an evening
with a guy like me?

04:46.586 --> 04:48.054
Maybe he could teach me
how to be cool.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.423
He's Isaac Hanson,
not the messiah.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.926
And FYI, he likes to be treated
like a regular guy.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.327
So no special attention.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.596
So I shouldn't offer
to butter his corn?

04:56.596 --> 04:59.299
( <i>phone rings</i> )

04:59.299 --> 05:00.567
Kinkle.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.469
It's Sabrina. We have a problem.
Are you alone?

05:02.469 --> 05:04.371
I can be.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.706
It's my gastroenterologist.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.909
You don't want
to hear this.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.145
What's up, Sabrina?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.247
My Aunt Irma found out
that you know I'm a witch.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.250
She wants to meet you tomorrow
and ask you a few questions.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.186
But tomorrow's Roxie's dinner.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.888
I have plans to eat spaghetti
with Isaac Hanson.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.523
Harvey, listen closely.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.125
When people disappoint Aunt Irma

05:25.125 --> 05:26.660
she turns them into things.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.527
What kind of things?

05:27.527 --> 05:29.229
Well, you know Big Ben?

05:29.229 --> 05:30.764
He wasn't always a clock.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.932
See you tomorrow.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.134
What do you mean
we can't see each other
on your birthday?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.570
The truth is my birthday dinner
is usually just family.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.838
It's kind of a tradition.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.406
Then things got
really complicated

05:39.406 --> 05:41.141
when my Aunt Irma announced
she was coming.

05:41.141 --> 05:44.878
Ugh,she's bitter, cranky
and just a little ( <i>whistles).</i>

05:44.878 --> 05:46.379
I'm really sorry, Josh.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.481
It's okay, we've got
a few nuts hanging

05:48.481 --> 05:50.417
from our family tree.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.885
Besides, in a
good relationship

05:51.885 --> 05:54.221
you can't let one evening
come between you.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.990
You're standing me up
for tomorrow night?!

05:56.990 --> 05:58.191
We're through!

05:58.191 --> 05:59.426
My hands are tied.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.027
The whole Kinkle clan
decided to have

06:01.027 --> 06:04.931
a last-minute family
reunion... at the farm!

06:04.931 --> 06:08.201
Farm? And what exactly
do the Kinkles grow

06:08.201 --> 06:09.402
on the Kinkle farm?

06:09.402 --> 06:11.104
Um, minks?

06:11.104 --> 06:15.642
Minks? You really
expect me to...?

06:15.642 --> 06:17.744
Oh, Harvey!

06:17.744 --> 06:21.481
I want it full length
with a really high collar!

06:22.449 --> 06:23.850
( <i>sighs</i> )

06:23.850 --> 06:27.120
That completes Aunt Irma's
demented demands.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.423
The house is totally
sterile... like her.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.459
Uh-oh.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.994
That's either Aunt Irma

06:33.994 --> 06:35.829
or a big wind
chasing Helen Hunt.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.064
Okay, remember

06:38.064 --> 06:40.133
stick together
and be strong.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.134
Don't give her an inch.

06:41.134 --> 06:45.639
She'll be lucky if she gets
a hello out of me.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.376
Huzzah, milady!

06:49.376 --> 06:51.511
I am your humble servant.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.314
Silence, you talking throw rug.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.081
<i>¿Que?</i>

06:55.081 --> 06:58.184
Oh, you have
a sandpaper tongue.

06:58.184 --> 07:01.655
I have corns on my feet.
Do the math.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.124
Oh, just a couple things
you need to know
about my Aunt Irma.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.792
Don't look her in the eye

07:05.792 --> 07:07.460
never start a sentence
with "anyhoo"

07:07.460 --> 07:11.131
and she can smell fear,
so stay downwind.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.832
Would you care for some
hot cocoa, Aunt Irma?

07:12.832 --> 07:13.500
You drink it.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.535
You're nothing
but skin and bones.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.202
Thank you.

07:16.202 --> 07:20.240
And Hilda, I notice your ring
finger is still bare.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.108
So it is.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.479
There's another finger
I'd like her to see.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.448
Hello, everybody. We're here.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.883
Nice to meet you,
Aunt Irma.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.618
I'll be the judge of that.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.320
Don't let us down,
Harvey.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.689
Our entire lives
depend on you.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.424
No pressure there.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.425
You'll do fine.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.427
Hello, Aunt Irma.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.828
How nice of you
to come for my birthday.

07:41.828 --> 07:42.996
Silence!

07:42.996 --> 07:46.599
So this is the infamously
trustworthy mortal.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.334
We're going to find out

07:47.334 --> 07:50.637
if you can take a secret
to the grave, Harvey Kinkle.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.005
( <i>cackles</i> )

07:52.005 --> 07:53.340
( <i>thunder booms</i> )

07:53.340 --> 07:54.507
Should I bow?

07:54.507 --> 07:56.476
It wouldn't hurt.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.748
Wow, Hanson's web page
gets a million hits a day.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.283
The only hits I get
on my web page are me

08:03.283 --> 08:05.919
checking to see if I got
any hits on my web page.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.120
Why don't you log into
their chat room

08:07.120 --> 08:09.889
and find out why
Isaac's a half-an-
hour late for dinner.

08:09.889 --> 08:10.357
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

08:10.357 --> 08:12.926
He's here! He's here!
I'll get it!

08:12.926 --> 08:15.128
I am such a huge fan of...

08:15.128 --> 08:17.097
not you.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.898
And a lovely
evening to you, too.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.533
Can you tell Sabrina
I'm here?

08:20.533 --> 08:21.968
She already went
to her aunt's house.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.437
Oh, bummer. I thought I could
catch her before she left.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.541
I really wanted her
to get her present
on her birthday.

08:28.541 --> 08:32.045
I hear leather
and 20% off.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.080
It was 15.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.282
I'll just drop it
by her aunt's house.

08:39.219 --> 08:42.389
Is your name
Harvey Kinkle?

08:42.389 --> 08:42.856
Yes.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.824
Well done.
Let's eat.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.493
Silence!

08:46.493 --> 08:48.628
I'm not through.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.331
Can you be trusted
to keep the Spellman secret?

08:51.331 --> 08:52.332
Absolutely.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.333
You're lying.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.768
Um, Aunt Irma, I don't mean

08:54.768 --> 08:56.536
to question
your interrogation skills

08:56.536 --> 08:58.938
but um, your lie detector
isn't plugged in.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.340
You're lying.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.610
Okay, you're not lying,
but you're insolent.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.312
I never trusted these machines,
anyway.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.547
Let's move on

09:07.547 --> 09:10.750
to a more accurate method
of truth detection...

09:10.750 --> 09:13.019
hot coals.

09:13.019 --> 09:16.056
Somebody fetch me
a frosty drink.

09:16.056 --> 09:16.956
Hot coals?

09:16.956 --> 09:17.991
Don't worry, I'm sure
she'll cool down

09:17.991 --> 09:19.793
once she's had
a cold beverage.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.761
Okay, we're going to be fine.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.229
What planet
are you on?

09:23.229 --> 09:25.999
We're out
of frosty drinks!

09:26.433 --> 09:28.301
You can't let Aunt Irma
rattle you.

09:28.301 --> 09:32.272
Sabrina, the woman wants
to grill me... literally.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.707
It's healthier
than being deep fried.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.276
Hug!

09:41.781 --> 09:45.318
Ugh, family tradition, huh?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.787
That must be Aunt Harvey.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.962
What's with you guys?
You haven't touched
any of your food.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.898
I'm waiting out of respect
for Mr. Hanson.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.033
And I just hate your cooking.

10:00.033 --> 10:03.536
( <i>phone rings</i> )
Hello?

10:03.536 --> 10:05.638
I understand.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.640
Thanks for calling.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.542
Isaac's assistant.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.144
Doesn't look like he's going
to make it after all.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.412
I can't believe
he'd stand you up

10:12.412 --> 10:13.746
after all the trouble
you went to.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.316
These rock stars
are so insensitive!

10:16.316 --> 10:17.684
How could Isaac do this?

10:17.684 --> 10:18.718
I'm okay with it.

10:18.718 --> 10:21.654
I mean to <i>me!</i>
My evening is ruined!

10:21.654 --> 10:22.822
Well, mine's
not going to be.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.057
I'm going
to the soup kitchen.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.458
I'll go with you.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.193
Morgan, you want
to help the needy?

10:27.193 --> 10:29.262
Yes, I do.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.965
And I'm going to start
with a bubble bath.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.301
You know,
I almost hate to say it

10:35.301 --> 10:37.504
but he smells delicious.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.205
SABRINA:
Harvey, how you doing?

10:39.205 --> 10:42.575
I'm all right.
It's not as hot as it looks.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.476
Yet.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.312
All right, Kinkle,
let's get this over with.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.680
You're in a dark alley

10:47.680 --> 10:49.782
a hoodlum throws you
against the wall.

10:49.782 --> 10:53.153
He asks,
"Are the Spellmans witches?"

10:53.153 --> 10:53.853
What do you say?

10:53.853 --> 10:54.454
He says, "No!"

10:54.454 --> 10:56.456
Only the mortal speaks.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.624
I say no.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.360
Copycat. The boy has no mind
of his own.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.562
Although he cooks
quite evenly.

11:02.562 --> 11:05.298
They say slow cooking
seals in the juices.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.233
What am I saying?

11:07.233 --> 11:09.669
Aunt Irma, it's just not fair
to question Harvey

11:09.669 --> 11:11.938
while he's roasting
at 475.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.440
Oh, keep talking, darling.
I'll make it 500.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.876
May God forgive
me, but I'm going
to set the table.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.578
Hilda!

11:18.578 --> 11:21.481
I'm sorry. I don't
know what I'm saying.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.384
Aunt Irma always turns me
into a basket case.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.386
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.489
Help!
I'm dried fruit!

11:32.559 --> 11:36.863
Ooh, Sabrina's cousin
sent her a cashmere sweater.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.364
No, wait.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.866
Merino wool.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.301
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

11:41.301 --> 11:43.603
Please be Isaac Hanson.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.573
Didn't we just do this?

11:46.573 --> 11:48.675
Oh, you're going
to love this.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.310
I just stopped by
the Spellmans

11:50.310 --> 11:51.945
where I saw Sabrina

11:51.945 --> 11:53.813
with her arms
around Harvey.

11:53.813 --> 11:58.451
No! Harvey's supposed to be
hand-selecting my mink!

11:58.451 --> 12:00.987
Yeah, well, Harvey's pulling
the mink over your eyes.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.256
Obviously, those two
are secretly dating.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.959
Then we should secretly
date to get back at them.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.360
Oh, yeah, that's the answer.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.362
Where's Miles and Roxie?

12:09.362 --> 12:12.999
They went to that
soup kitchen she's
always yapping about.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.235
Hey, you know what?
That's not such a bad idea.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.736
You and I have
better things to do

12:16.736 --> 12:18.905
than sit around here
feeling sorry for ourselves.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.106
You're right.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.908
Have a nice time
at the soup kitchen.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.078
I am going to drown my
sorrows a different way.

12:28.047 --> 12:31.317
Oh, this one's a return
waiting to happen.

12:32.652 --> 12:36.022
Twice you've been
interrogated and
twice you've failed

12:36.022 --> 12:40.360
yet, if you can answer this
one simple question honestly

12:40.360 --> 12:42.362
this crucible will be over.

12:42.362 --> 12:48.868
Kinkle, in your opinion,
am I an attractive woman?

12:49.702 --> 12:51.537
If he says yes,
she'll never believe him.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.873
If he says no, she'll turn him
into a dust ruffle.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.476
You have no idea how much
I'd like to be a fig right now.

12:56.476 --> 13:00.480
Wonder if should have my tail
enlarged?

13:01.514 --> 13:03.449
Well, Kinkle...

13:03.449 --> 13:06.319
am I an attractive
woman?

13:06.486 --> 13:10.490
Well, on the outside,
you're nice-looking.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.557
Good, Harvey!

13:11.557 --> 13:12.091
But...

13:12.091 --> 13:13.026
No buts! No buts!

13:13.026 --> 13:14.627
on the inside...

13:14.627 --> 13:17.664
honestly, you're hideous.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.732
Bad, Harvey!
Very, very bad!

13:19.732 --> 13:21.434
Oh, no, here it comes.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.836
Hilda, it's been nice knowing
you in your present form.

13:23.836 --> 13:24.937
Likewise.

13:24.937 --> 13:27.640
Maybe we'll get lucky and
end up a washer-dryer combo.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.042
I'll be the bleach.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.510
You're right, Kinkle.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.712
I am hideous
on the inside.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.714
So hideous that I've baked you,
stretched you

13:34.714 --> 13:36.082
and put you on a rotisserie.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.350
So evil...

13:37.350 --> 13:39.585
that if I were to let you
go out into the world

13:39.585 --> 13:42.255
you would tell everyone
that the Spellmans are witches.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.756
No, I wouldn't!

13:43.756 --> 13:46.559
I'd never do anything
that would hurt Sabrina.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.361
Good answer.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.029
Really good answer.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.433
I'm convinced our secret
is safe with you.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.268
You may return
to your mortal life.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.036
You're free!
( <i>squeals</i> )

13:57.036 --> 13:58.438
Not by a long shot.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.640
I promised Morgan a mink.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.742
Oh, maybe
I can help out.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.810
It's a mink
substitute

14:03.810 --> 14:05.745
but she'll never know
the difference.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.714
You do beautiful work.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.282
I love the lining.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.917
Well, I've got to call Josh

14:10.917 --> 14:12.819
and salvage whatever's left
of my birthday.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.921
Not that this wasn't
absolutely lovely.

14:18.591 --> 14:22.528
See? Now this is what life's
really about-- helping others.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.697
It's not about material
belongings or anything...

14:24.697 --> 14:25.698
( <i>phone rings</i> )

14:25.698 --> 14:27.200
Yello?

14:27.200 --> 14:27.867
Hey, Josh.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.802
You're dead to me, Sabrina.

14:31.971 --> 14:32.638
Bun?

14:32.972 --> 14:34.140
I'll pass.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.075
( <i>phone rings</i> )

14:36.075 --> 14:37.977
Dead to you?!
What's going on?

14:37.977 --> 14:40.480
I stopped by your aunt's house
with your birthday present.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.814
I saw you and Harvey hugging.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.250
Oh, no.
I can explain everything.

14:44.250 --> 14:48.821
Don't bother.
I'm busy helping those in need.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.824
Hey, buddy, what, my buns
aren't good enough for you?

14:52.759 --> 14:54.026
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

14:54.026 --> 14:56.329
That boy doesn't know
if he's coming or going.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.098
Come in, Josh!

14:59.098 --> 14:59.632
Hello?

14:59.632 --> 15:02.668
( <i>screaming and laughing</i> )

15:02.668 --> 15:03.936
That never
gets old. Hey.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.071
I'm Morgan.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.506
I'm Isaac.
I hope you don't mind.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.640
I brought a meat dish.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.575
Honey, you <i>are</i>
the meat dish.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.677
I said that out loud,
didn't I?

15:11.677 --> 15:12.578
Where's Roxie?

15:12.578 --> 15:14.981
A-A-At some soup place.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.650
She didn't feel like waiting
around for you, but I did.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.785
Well,I don't want Roxie
to be mad at me.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.520
You want to jump in the limo and
we'll head down there?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.455
If you think that
I am the kind of girl

15:22.455 --> 15:24.657
that would jump into a limo
with a stranger

15:24.657 --> 15:26.359
you are so right!

15:28.394 --> 15:30.663
So, if you think about it,
we're all just bacteria

15:30.663 --> 15:33.199
under the fingernail of the
colossal ambivalent man-god

15:33.199 --> 15:36.302
whom I privately refer to
as Jasper the Magnificent.

15:36.302 --> 15:39.038
Dude, you just made me
realize something--

15:39.038 --> 15:41.974
if a guy like you
is functioning in society

15:41.974 --> 15:45.011
then I gave up way too soon.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.181
Josh...

15:48.181 --> 15:49.482
I'm listening.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.751
There's nothing going on
between me and Harvey.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.919
You were hugging him.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.086
It's my birthday!

15:54.086 --> 15:56.322
A lot of people are giving me
birthday hugs.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.158
Okay, okay, hug's over.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.860
Sabrina, why would
you lie to me

16:00.860 --> 16:03.229
about a family birthday and
then spend it with Harvey?

16:03.229 --> 16:04.497
It was out of my control.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.232
So what are you saying,
he just showed up

16:06.232 --> 16:08.100
and you were obligated
to hang all over him?

16:08.100 --> 16:08.901
Josh, you've got
to believe me--

16:08.901 --> 16:12.004
this whole evening
has been torture, literally.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.906
The only person I want
to hang all over is you.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.508
How can I believe you?

16:16.876 --> 16:18.144
That makes it
a little easier.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.412
Look,my birthday's
not over yet.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.646
Why don't we go back
to my aunt's house

16:20.646 --> 16:21.414
and we'll
celebrate together

16:21.414 --> 16:23.783
like we should've done
in the first place.

16:23.783 --> 16:24.717
That would be great.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.152
And I could open
the gift you got me.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.820
Ooh, I think you're
really going to like it.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.121
And don't believe what
Morgan tells you.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.157
It was only 15% off.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.864
Aunt Hilda! Aunt Zelda!

16:37.864 --> 16:41.334
Uh, Sabrina, you've got
three little pigs
in your house.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.070
And I bet I know who
the big bad wolf is.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.506
ZELDA:
Sabrina, thank goodness
you're here.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.507
Look,what happened?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.041
When I left,
everything was kosher;

16:49.041 --> 16:50.543
and now, you're pork!

16:50.543 --> 16:52.445
Just as Aunt Irma
was about to leave

16:52.445 --> 16:54.981
somebody called her
"prune face."

16:54.981 --> 16:56.949
HILDA:
What? I adore dried fruit.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.785
And, having <i>been</i> dried fruit,
I feel qualified to say that.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.588
SALEM:
Hey, who's up for makin' bacon?

17:04.156 --> 17:06.392
Come on, people!
Nobody's eating
the spaghetti!

17:06.392 --> 17:08.361
I made it myself!

17:08.628 --> 17:09.762
( <i>thuds</i> )

17:09.762 --> 17:11.564
I think it needs salt.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.933
Oh, you poor kids.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.201
Come in and have some soup.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.102
Oh, thanks

17:16.102 --> 17:18.905
but we have these great
little quiches in the limo.

17:18.905 --> 17:23.409
Everybody, this is Isaac Hanson
from Hanson.

17:23.409 --> 17:27.580
Yeah, and I'm Steve Snapple
from Snapple.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.748
Yo, Rox!

17:28.748 --> 17:29.849
Isaac!
Hey.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.951
I'm so glad you
finally made it.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.487
I've got the next
24 hours planned
out for us.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.955
Roxie, you're going to hate me
when I tell you this

17:35.955 --> 17:37.890
but I can't stay--
the plans have changed.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.959
I can only be here
for a couple of hours.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.994
Let me guess: you and the
boys are jetting to Paris

17:41.994 --> 17:43.129
to go clubbing with Madonna?

17:43.129 --> 17:45.097
Actually, no.
We're flying to Ohio

17:45.097 --> 17:47.099
to sing for some kids
at a hospital.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.535
Ah. I did not know that.

17:49.535 --> 17:50.469
But I'm really sorry.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.371
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

17:52.371 --> 17:54.473
I can think of something.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.743
Listen and listen good...
Hanson.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.278
You may be tops in pop

17:59.278 --> 18:00.813
but I don't like you dissing
my friend Roxie

18:00.813 --> 18:03.783
or your implied diss
with regard to me.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.352
We're through, <i>capiche?</i>

18:08.521 --> 18:11.057
Never seen him before
in my life.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.092
Aunt Irma,
I need to talk to you.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.827
I know you're
out there somewhere!

18:14.827 --> 18:16.495
What is it now?

18:16.495 --> 18:19.665
I was right in the middle of
barbecuing my brother-in-law.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.567
Look, I don't care
if Aunt Hilda called you

18:21.567 --> 18:23.402
her pet name
for dried plums.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.704
You had no right
to turn her

18:24.704 --> 18:26.806
or anyone else
into barnyard animals.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.541
I beg your pardon.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.976
Do you know to whom
you're speaking?

18:29.976 --> 18:31.310
Silence! It's my turn now

18:31.310 --> 18:32.812
and I want to set
the record straight.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.615
These two little piggies
have done a fantastic job
in raising me.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.584
And the third little piggy,
well... we'll get back
to him later.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.520
The point is, they don't
deserve your stupid punishment.

18:41.520 --> 18:45.257
If it makes you happy taking
your anger out on somebody,
take it out on me.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.894
My, my, my, my,
my, my, my.

18:48.894 --> 18:52.164
What a brazen little witch
you turned out to be.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.767
You're the first person
who's ever stood up to me.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.868
Could you just give me
a general idea

18:55.868 --> 18:57.103
of what's going
to happen here?

18:57.103 --> 18:59.572
Certainly. With an
attitude like that

18:59.572 --> 19:03.342
you may wind up being
the next matriarch of
the Spellman dynasty.

19:03.342 --> 19:04.443
Say what now?

19:04.443 --> 19:06.412
Sabrina, you're a
formidable young lady

19:06.412 --> 19:08.581
and you've earned
my respect.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.416
I will now
take my leave...

19:10.416 --> 19:14.520
right after you give your
auntie a great big hug.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.688
Enough.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.857
Happy birthday
and good-bye.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.259
Wait! What about
the little piggies?

19:20.259 --> 19:22.962
Oh, they're so much cuter
this way.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.830
Oh, very well.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.967
Sabrina, that
was incredible!

19:27.967 --> 19:30.770
An extraordinary display
of courage and principle.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.772
I taught you
that.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.006
I'd love to accept
your accolades

19:34.006 --> 19:35.541
but I've got a birthday
to celebrate

19:35.541 --> 19:37.309
and a boyfriend to thaw.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.848
Oh, Sabrina,
there you are.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.717
Hey, what happened
to the three little pigs?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.686
Oh, they lived
happily every after.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.588
You know, someone still hasn't
given me my birthday hug.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.591
You're next, Josh.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.233
Sabrina, what would you
like for dessert?

20:01.233 --> 20:02.868
We've got birthday
cake and ice cream.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.737
And gingerbread cookies
and cobbler...

20:04.737 --> 20:07.173
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I am way too stuffed.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.574
Hey, you know what
would be a great idea?

20:08.574 --> 20:10.543
We take all those desserts
down to the soup kitchen

20:10.543 --> 20:12.111
and share them
with the people there.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.280
Sexy and
socially aware.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.248
Can I pick them
or what?
