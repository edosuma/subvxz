Previously on Californication...

00:02.298 --> 00:03.699
- How's school?
- Dad, I told you.

00:03.733 --> 00:05.501
I'm not going.
I'm working on a novel.

00:05.535 --> 00:07.503
What are you gonna
fill a novel with?

00:07.537 --> 00:09.705
Life, love, sex, death.

00:09.772 --> 00:11.064
What do you know
about any of those things?

00:11.184 --> 00:13.142
Move it along, groupie,
and take him with you.

00:13.176 --> 00:14.777
You watch your tongue,
you filthy mongrel.

00:14.811 --> 00:15.978
This is Faith.

00:16.012 --> 00:17.546
Have a look and grasp

00:17.580 --> 00:20.950
the cosmic importance
of this lovely young lady.

00:20.983 --> 00:22.718
Without her, there'd be
no rock and roll.

00:22.752 --> 00:24.787
Tony talked about you all the time.

00:24.821 --> 00:27.690
He said that you had an uncanny ability

00:27.724 --> 00:29.525
to suck killer riffs out of him.

00:29.559 --> 00:31.661
I'm sorry I was such a bitch.

00:31.694 --> 00:34.196
God, I'm--I'm so sorry
I fucked your husband.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.832
But you haven't nailed it yet.

00:36.866 --> 00:38.067

00:40.837 --> 00:42.505
I fired my manager last week,

00:42.538 --> 00:43.939
and I'm all out of cocaine.

00:44.006 --> 00:45.207
Might you be in the market

00:45.241 --> 00:46.709

00:46.743 --> 00:48.811
If you can get me some Peruvian flake,

00:48.845 --> 00:51.414
I'll maybe think about
throwing you in the mix.

00:51.447 --> 00:53.382
Here you go, rock star asshole.

00:53.416 --> 00:55.017

Every taste, every smell.

keep the pages coming,

02:43.089 --> 02:45.057
smoke a little peaches and herb even,

02:45.091 --> 02:47.226
but stay away from the hard stuff.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.029
And--and no more of that
tasting and smelling.

08:33.511 --> 08:35.113
That's what I said.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.082
I mean, that--
that's totally understandable.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.134
I-I-I don't think so.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.448

08:57.469 --> 08:58.736
to my estranged better half.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.138

- Yeah.

09:05.344 --> 09:06.584

Isn't it weird, though,
because she works for you?

09:11.350 --> 09:13.285
I'm paying Karen to remodel my home.

09:13.318 --> 09:15.920
If she thinks she can expect
more than a paycheck

09:15.954 --> 09:17.689
for her services, fuck her.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.091
- Wow.
- All's fair, Hank.

09:19.124 --> 09:20.425
I see you and your husband have

09:20.459 --> 09:21.979
the same twisted sense of entitlement.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.429
That's--it's actually
kind of cute.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.965
I don't want to twist your arm, but, um,

09:26.999 --> 09:29.301
I'd like to take your hand here

09:29.334 --> 09:30.935
and shove it up my skirt.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.706
- Ow.
- Yum, yum.

09:38.343 --> 09:40.211
You making a play on the boss's wife?

09:40.245 --> 09:41.679
You've got no fucking shame.

09:41.713 --> 09:43.815
Kruller, it is not what it looks like.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.817
I'm just meat. Man meat.
You know how that goes.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.118
You know.

09:47.152 --> 09:48.987
Gimme an excuse, pal.

09:49.021 --> 09:51.023
You won't even hear me coming.

09:51.056 --> 09:52.524
Pfft, pfft.

09:52.557 --> 09:55.192
I'll slice them fucking cheeks
wide open.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.728
They'll be flapping about like the sails

09:56.762 --> 09:58.630
on the <i>H.M.S. Bounty.</i>

09:58.664 --> 10:01.833
See what a fucking charmer
you are then, son.

10:06.738 --> 10:08.806
What are you doing?

10:08.840 --> 10:10.641
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting ready for takeoff.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.178
What's wrong with you?
You're sweating like a pig.

10:13.211 --> 10:14.879
You know what a nervous flier I am.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.248
No, I don't.
I've never flown with you.

10:16.281 --> 10:18.249
That's because I never fly, Hank.

10:18.283 --> 10:19.917
It scares the shit out of me.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.353
What's supposed to keep this whole thing

10:21.386 --> 10:22.854
from just falling into the ocean?

10:22.888 --> 10:24.356
Well, for one, we're going to New York.

10:24.389 --> 10:25.390
There is no ocean.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.892
That's even worse!

10:26.959 --> 10:28.226
Certain death!

10:28.260 --> 10:30.128
Okay, just buck up,
buddy-boy.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.063
This shit is too weird for me.
I'm out.

10:32.097 --> 10:35.333
Hank. H-Han--Hank!

10:35.367 --> 10:38.937
Hank.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.239
Hey.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.142
Hey yourself.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.344
You just can't stay away
from me, can you?

10:46.378 --> 10:48.046
What are you doing here, Hank?

10:48.080 --> 10:51.216
Oh, my presence was requested
by the king of pop-tarts.

10:51.249 --> 10:52.984
- Same.
- Oh, I get it.

10:53.018 --> 10:55.387
He's in the market
for a new muse, is that it?

10:55.420 --> 10:57.121
Who says I'm interested?

10:57.189 --> 10:58.456
Well, you're here, aren't you?

10:58.490 --> 11:00.592
Maybe I heard you were gonna be here.

11:00.625 --> 11:01.892
Maybe you did.
Did you?

11:01.927 --> 11:03.528
Maybe.

11:03.595 --> 11:04.929
Maybe I just came with a friend.

11:04.963 --> 11:07.999
Oh, Jesus Christ.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.300
No, I've got it.

11:09.334 --> 11:11.669
I've got it.
I'm fine.

11:11.703 --> 11:14.105
- Frank!
- Widow.

11:14.139 --> 11:16.708
- Oh, call me Trudy.
- Okay.

11:16.742 --> 11:18.076
Beautiful.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.578
You had your dick in me mouth, remember?

11:19.611 --> 11:20.979
Of course.
Who could forget?

11:21.013 --> 11:23.615
Oh, he's got a nice rig on him, he does.

11:23.648 --> 11:27.218
He could foam the fucking runway
with that thing.

11:27.252 --> 11:28.932
- Good to know.
- So you guys are BFFs now?

11:28.954 --> 11:30.488
Yeah.

11:30.522 --> 11:32.590
We've certainly got a lot in common, no?

11:32.624 --> 11:35.426
Been riding the same
disco stick and all.

You are good.

You have no idea.

12:12.497 --> 12:14.765
I inherited a dead uncle's
vinyl collection

12:14.800 --> 12:17.669
and spent years in my childhood bedroom

12:17.702 --> 12:19.737
just listening to records.

12:19.771 --> 12:22.039
Hmm. Is that all?

12:22.074 --> 12:23.542
Hmm?

12:23.575 --> 12:25.176
I will have you know, Hank,

12:25.210 --> 12:27.645
that I was a very good

12:36.221 --> 12:38.189
To what?

12:38.223 --> 12:40.124
You know, you said you could
do something with me,

12:40.158 --> 12:42.226
bring my best work out of me.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.528
You said that you could be the hammer

12:44.563 --> 12:47.299
that would help me to ♪ nail it ♪

12:47.332 --> 12:49.701
I'm not sure, Hank.

12:49.734 --> 12:51.235
Something tells me
you're a little more trouble

12:51.269 --> 12:52.570
than you're worth.

12:52.604 --> 12:54.272
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:54.306 --> 12:57.709
I-I can wax on and wax off
with the best of them,

12:57.742 --> 12:59.744
Mrs. Miyagi.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.312
Atticus would like a word with you.

13:01.346 --> 13:03.181
Ugh. Okay.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.783
Not you, sweetheart.

13:04.816 --> 13:07.251
I told you he wanted to get
in your knickers.

13:07.319 --> 13:09.854
Well, it's not as easy as it looks.

13:09.888 --> 13:12.657
Yeah, don't I know it.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.928
Whoa.
Groovy bedroom, dude.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.430
This is not a bedroom.

13:18.463 --> 13:21.866
This is my very own erotic chapel.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.902
Mm.

13:23.935 --> 13:27.038
That doesn't sound
the slightest bit creepy.

13:27.072 --> 13:29.741
- The answer is yes.
- Sorry?

13:29.774 --> 13:31.575
I would very much like to enter

13:31.610 --> 13:33.745
into a relationship with you,

13:33.778 --> 13:36.781
one based solely on sexual pleasure

13:36.815 --> 13:39.184
and the transference of inspiration.

13:39.217 --> 13:42.353
I'm sorry, Atticus,

13:42.387 --> 13:43.788
but the answer is no.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.792
Tony said that you were like a miracle.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.394
When you came into his life,

13:49.427 --> 13:52.530
he was blocked and bloated
and strung out

13:52.564 --> 13:53.798
on China white,

13:53.832 --> 13:55.600
and two days later,

13:55.634 --> 13:58.436
he had a double album's worth
of material.

13:58.470 --> 14:02.540
I would--I would very much like
to receive the same benefits,

14:02.574 --> 14:05.643
in exchange for which
you will experience

14:05.677 --> 14:08.546
first-class travel,
pharmaceutical-grade narcotics,

14:08.580 --> 14:11.015
uh--uh--uh,
the occasional trinket,

14:11.049 --> 14:13.818
and--and a solid 5.9 inches

14:13.852 --> 14:15.286
of--of rock-star penis.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.821
That's from taint to tip.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.189
And it's the high end of average.

14:18.223 --> 14:19.824
Don't believe what you read.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.927
Wow, that does sound
like the deal of a lifetime.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.964
But, uh, it's--
it's not really that simple.

14:25.997 --> 14:27.798
Why is it not that simple?

14:27.832 --> 14:30.668
O-okay. I'll buy you
a German automobile,

14:30.702 --> 14:31.969
but that's it.

14:32.003 --> 14:34.171
Atticus, your wife is outside.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.907
Yes, but I slipped her an Ambien.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.410
What? That's awful.

14:38.443 --> 14:40.912
Is it? Why?

14:40.946 --> 14:42.213
'Cause you drugged your wife.

14:42.247 --> 14:45.149
She loves drugs.

14:45.183 --> 14:49.420
Look, I'm not actually used
to having to ask

14:49.454 --> 14:50.955
for sexual favors.

14:51.022 --> 14:53.257
Typically, they--
they just come to me.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.659
I know.

14:54.693 --> 14:56.027
I do.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.962
The thing is,

14:58.029 --> 15:01.298
when I throw in with a guy,
I go all-in.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.835
That sounds delightful.

15:03.868 --> 15:06.670
I need to know what we're
trying to accomplish here.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.207
A rock opera.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.743
About...love.

15:11.776 --> 15:13.277
Great. All right.

15:13.311 --> 15:16.013
Play me something.

15:16.047 --> 15:17.748
You're fucking joking, right?

15:17.782 --> 15:19.350
I have to audition for you?

15:19.384 --> 15:20.618
Do you think we'll make it?

15:20.652 --> 15:21.853
His favorite place to play

15:21.886 --> 15:24.788
was Madison Square Garden.

15:24.823 --> 15:28.459
Atticus promised to get me in there.

15:28.493 --> 15:31.896
I'm gonna spread his ashes
all over the fucking place.

15:31.930 --> 15:35.300
Is that sanitary?

15:35.333 --> 15:37.301
What are you so scared of, pumpkin?

15:37.335 --> 15:39.970
It's just...

15:40.005 --> 15:43.541
so unnatural,
this...flying.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.877
What's the worst that could happen?

15:45.910 --> 15:48.746
Huh? We end up fucking crumbs
in a jar, huh?

15:48.780 --> 15:51.716
Pbbbt! Big fucking deal.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.986
All just dust in the wind,
you silly twat.

15:57.589 --> 16:00.925
You remind me
of my ex-wife.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.593
You still love her?

16:02.627 --> 16:05.196
Moments like these, when I'm...

16:05.230 --> 16:07.298
staring death in the face,
I realize I have a lot

16:07.332 --> 16:09.400
of unresolved feelings for her.

16:09.434 --> 16:11.936
Yeah, she is the mother of my child.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.838
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

16:13.872 --> 16:17.208
Well, I feel that my life
has deteriorated

16:17.242 --> 16:18.876
ever since we broke up.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.178
But I've had some
solid sexual experiences.

16:21.212 --> 16:22.846
Right.

16:22.881 --> 16:25.650
I've made some serious
deposits in the wank bank.

16:28.953 --> 16:30.254
That's brilliant.

16:30.288 --> 16:33.924
I'm...still in love

Romance and longing.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.229

18:18.263 --> 18:20.665
all heart and balls and swagger,

18:20.698 --> 18:24.935
but that boy turned into a rock star,

18:24.969 --> 18:26.704

everything he ever wanted

19:07.979 --> 19:10.314
I want this pathetic
little slut off my plane.

19:10.348 --> 19:13.351
This is my private airplane,
and I make the rules!

19:13.384 --> 19:14.985
Why are we not landing?

19:15.019 --> 19:17.921
Why are the landing gears
not coming down?

19:17.956 --> 19:19.223
What did she do?

19:19.257 --> 19:20.958
She was inappropriate with me,

19:20.992 --> 19:23.961
with my wife on board, no less.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.633
Is she alive?

19:28.666 --> 19:30.467
She's fine.
Go back to sleep.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.502
It's just fucking bullshit.
He's clearly pissed off

19:32.504 --> 19:34.072
'cause I wasn't interested
in fucking him.

19:34.105 --> 19:35.473
I knew it.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.876
I knew you were a fucking cow.

19:37.909 --> 19:38.876
Hey, I thought we were friends.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.411
No, no more!

19:40.445 --> 19:42.079
Home-wrecker!
Home-wrecking fucking cow!

19:42.113 --> 19:43.881
No, I don't buy that for a second.

19:43.915 --> 19:45.483
I don't give a fuck if you buy it.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.352
She's gone, and I'm gonna tell

19:47.385 --> 19:50.054
the entire rock and roll
community that you have

19:50.088 --> 19:52.290
vagitosis and warts.

19:52.323 --> 19:53.691
That is just fucking mean.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.560
Okay, land this fucking plane,

19:55.593 --> 19:57.061
but if she goes, I go,
and you can finish

19:57.095 --> 19:58.496
your fucking musical by yourself,

19:58.530 --> 20:00.031
you spoiled ginger.

20:00.064 --> 20:01.698
And get your house in order,
'cause your wife

20:01.733 --> 20:04.602
is looking for strange.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.270
All right, that's the second time

20:06.304 --> 20:07.672
you've laid hands on me, broheme.

20:07.705 --> 20:09.273
The first time, I totally deserved it

20:09.307 --> 20:10.775
'cause I wrecked your piano
and your cocaine,

20:10.808 --> 20:12.776
but I did not deserve
that pathetic little

20:12.810 --> 20:14.244
bitch-slap just now.

20:14.312 --> 20:16.414
You know what that calls for?

20:16.447 --> 20:17.681
Titty twister!

20:19.117 --> 20:20.518
Agh! Get him off me!

20:24.622 --> 20:26.724
Oh, Jesus, Mary, Joseph!

20:26.758 --> 20:29.060
Here we come!

20:29.127 --> 20:30.962
Hank? Hank?

20:30.995 --> 20:32.363
Hold me!

20:32.397 --> 20:34.966
Uh, settle down, Runks.
If this is--

20:34.999 --> 20:38.602
if this is it,
this is a good day to die.

20:40.471 --> 20:43.273
Shi-i-i-t!

20:44.976 --> 20:46.344
Jesus!

20:50.615 --> 20:54.485
Tony!

20:56.187 --> 20:58.722
Oh, no!

21:03.094 --> 21:05.963
Well, thank you for standing up for me.

21:05.997 --> 21:09.066
Oh, sure, no problem.
I mean, who wouldn't?

21:09.100 --> 21:11.135
Just because
you're a groupie and--

21:11.169 --> 21:13.171
and you've slept with
thousands of rocker dudes

21:13.204 --> 21:15.239
doesn't mean you're not
a woman of virtue.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.553
And I don't believe for a second

21:16.574 --> 21:18.008
that you have vagitosis.

21:18.042 --> 21:19.676
- Or warts.
- If you say so.

21:19.711 --> 21:21.179
Go ahead, Churchill.

21:21.212 --> 21:22.780
Get in there.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.749
I don't know if I can.
I'm too freaked out.

21:24.782 --> 21:26.383
Come on, prime minister.

21:26.417 --> 21:27.751
If you're gonna die,
wouldn't you rather die

21:27.785 --> 21:29.253
with your dick in me bum?
Huh?

21:32.924 --> 21:34.525
Yeah.

21:39.631 --> 21:40.832
Oh, fuck this.

21:40.865 --> 21:42.466
If I'm gonna die,

21:42.500 --> 21:44.368
