01:41.435 --> 01:43.437
Okay, Miss Mike, you're in.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.364
Watch your ass.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.454
Definitely Taliban presence here.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.082
Not a lot, but they're here. Over.

02:03.207 --> 02:06.544
If you see Bin Laden, You can
give him a big New York kiss.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.297
Then chop his nuts off. He
can wear them as earrings.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.299
Roger that.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.886
Some old guy is making eyes at me.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.805
God damn!

02:17.930 --> 02:19.557
I can't see anything out of this.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.767
You should bring that
outfit back to the States,

02:21.892 --> 02:23.644
you can wear it again for Halloween.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.188
Next time, you're wearing the dress.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.859
Craig, I've got a
problem with the old guy.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.402
Take it easy.

02:32.194 --> 02:35.656
He's not taking his eyes
off me, This guy knows.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.950
I think he knows.
- Hang in there, Mike.

03:00.973 --> 03:04.476
Control, we have an unexpected
visitor. Request positive I.D. Over.

03:04.602 --> 03:05.936
Go.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.067
Visitor is a friendly VIP.

03:12.193 --> 03:15.029
Repeat, visitor is a CIA contractor.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.114
Abort mission. Over.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.664
This is not good. Craig, do you read?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.208
I'm in deep shit, man.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.168
The old man's ratting me out.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.796
Did you get that?

03:32.922 --> 03:35.132
Captain McCenzie, do you understand me?

03:35.257 --> 03:37.426
You are to abort this mission.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.856
If you're in trouble and
you can't speak, just cough.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.380
What the hell are you
doing here, soldier?

05:39.131 --> 05:41.050
Where's the rest of your unit?

05:42.468 --> 05:45.763
Listen, these ragheads would
love to slit your throat.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.223
Now, I need to know how
many of you there are

05:48.349 --> 05:51.727
and what you're doing here, so
I can try to save your necks.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.565
You just don't get it, do you?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.342
Let me spell it out to you.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.221
I work for CIA.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.599
I cannot allow one lost soldier

06:30.724 --> 06:33.352
to compromise my entire operation.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.357
Okay, your choice.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.293
You know what I think, soldier?

06:59.461 --> 07:02.589
I think you are dressed like a woman,

07:02.714 --> 07:06.427
because secretly you
don't want to be a man.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.002
Captain McCenzie, your orders are
to stand down. You are not to...

07:40.627 --> 07:44.006
Now, when I'm done cutting you,

07:44.840 --> 07:48.218
these boys will finish
making a woman of you.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.809
Boy, am I glad to see you.

07:56.018 --> 07:56.935
Craig!

08:03.817 --> 08:05.194
You all right?

08:05.486 --> 08:06.612
Oh, man!

08:07.654 --> 08:09.448
My wife is gonna be relieved.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.492
But control is gonna
cut your balls off, man.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.535
That guy was CIA.

08:14.411 --> 08:18.123
It seems to me, you party with the
devil, God ain't ever gonna help you.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.917
Come on, let's go.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.514
I'm all in.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.100
Come on, let's see what you've got.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.986
How about you give me a loan

09:29.111 --> 09:30.779
and hold on to my bike as collateral?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.447
When are you going to learn, soldier?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.449
You're out of luck, not cash.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.035
I've never seen anyone
unluckier than you.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.790
So, how did you get out
of the army alive, anyway?

09:42.332 --> 09:45.168
You know what they say, "Lucky in war,

09:45.294 --> 09:47.713
unlucky in life."

09:52.634 --> 09:54.553
So how about the loan?

09:56.096 --> 09:59.516
There you go, soldier. A
nation's grateful thanks.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.353
Until the end of the month.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.023
Deal.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.698
All right, hands on
the table. Nobody move!

10:14.823 --> 10:16.408
Cool it, kid. What's the problem?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.909
The problem?

10:18.201 --> 10:21.246
Two aces of spades?
<i>-</i> lt's just a silly mistake.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.040
You stacked the deck, Tony?

10:23.165 --> 10:25.250
I let you win every once in a while.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.757
Didn't you hear what my friend said?

10:31.882 --> 10:33.008
Put your hands on the table.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.802
Trust me, this is not the
way you want to resolve this.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.056
Shut up, all right? You think you can
cheat us like your loser buddy over here?

10:39.181 --> 10:40.974
We're taking the money.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.230
Look, kid,just take the money
and get the hell out of here.

10:47.356 --> 10:48.857
Lucida, give them your purse.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.151
All right, put the money in the bag.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.322
Jeez!

10:55.864 --> 10:57.366
All right, you're next, cowboy.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.743
Your turn. Put the money in the bag.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.828
Put the money in the bag!

11:09.044 --> 11:10.962
All of it.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.715
All of it.

11:22.933 --> 11:26.478
You can put the gun down now.
It's only loaded with blanks.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.188
Really? Let's check!

11:28.313 --> 11:30.357
You really want me to pull this trigger?

11:31.525 --> 11:32.693
Let her go, McCenzie.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.153
Hey! What the hell is going on?

11:46.998 --> 11:48.709
What the hell is going on?

11:48.834 --> 11:50.919
They hired stunt guys.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.882
They want to do business with you.

12:00.637 --> 12:03.724
Just wanted to see if you
still had it in you, soldier.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.604
Captain McCenzie, we
need a man like you.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.946
Well, I don't need you.
All I want is my loan.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.533
Thanks for the show.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.910
Crazy.

12:24.619 --> 12:27.789
We'll do it your way, Sister.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.459
Trust me, little brother.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.220
Cheers.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.601
So, what do you think they wanted?

12:49.978 --> 12:52.355
There's only one thing I'm good at.

12:54.983 --> 12:58.862
You know, Craig. I'm so broke, man.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.993
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make some money.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.245
Anything. Anything.

13:07.537 --> 13:12.125
The banks, fucking banks, they
already took everything, you know?

13:15.670 --> 13:18.924
There's no work here, man.
There's nothing for a man

13:19.049 --> 13:22.177
der unehrenhaft aus der
Armee entlassen wurde.

13:24.805 --> 13:28.433
We both fought for our country,
Mike, we got nothing for it.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.772
Well, maybe now we need to
start fighting for some money.

13:33.897 --> 13:37.234
Some of the guys from the old
unit are pulling in loads of cash

13:37.359 --> 13:39.653
as mercs in Mexico.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.196
And then...

13:42.572 --> 13:45.450
Hey, baby. What are you doing up?

13:45.659 --> 13:49.204
It's not me who can't sleep, Daddy.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.373
It's Winston.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.418
Come on, darling. Let's
get Winston back to bed.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.712
Look at that, look at
what your nuts made.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.591
I saved those nuts.
<i>-</i> Good night, Daddy. Good night, Craig.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.638
Good night, guys.
- Good night.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.060
You love Joanna and Elize?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.688
Of course.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.982
Then forget about fighting.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.609
We'll find some other
way to make some money.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.863
I've got about two more weeks before
the banks change the locks on my doors.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.997
Soliders of Fortune.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.791
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.918
If you've received this link,

14:37.043 --> 14:38.795
then your net worth pre-qualifies you

14:38.920 --> 14:41.506
for the Soldiers of
Fortune Adventure Program,

14:41.631 --> 14:44.134
the ultimate in extreme vacationing.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.096
On your adventure mission you'll
experience the adrenalin rush of combat

14:48.221 --> 14:49.890
in an actual war zone,

14:50.015 --> 14:52.309
but without the risk
of losing your life.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.270
After all, you've worked
too hard for your millions

14:55.395 --> 14:57.647
not to enjoy them until a ripe old age.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.150
Whether you're sniping
enemy mercenaries,

15:00.275 --> 15:02.360
clandestinely delivering
a cache of weapons,

15:02.485 --> 15:04.154
or blowing up a compound,

15:04.279 --> 15:05.655
you'll be protected
every step of the way

15:05.780 --> 15:08.658
by our qualified action teams.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.538
Every member on our staff
is a highly decorated

15:13.663 --> 15:15.624
special operations veteran.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.459
You prove your manhood,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.836
they ensure your complete safety.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.632
All the proceeds support the freedom
fighters of a small island nation.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.300
And, unlike other charities,

15:25.425 --> 15:28.553
you'll be able to personally oversee
how your contribution is delivered.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.515
While your peers boast about
that luxury cruise in the Caymans,

15:32.641 --> 15:36.019
you fought for liberty
and freedom in a war zone.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.898
We offer the ultimate
in bragging rights.

15:40.732 --> 15:44.569
And the best part is,
it's all tax deductable.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.727
Would you knock it off?
I'm trying to sleep.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.270
Good morning.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.358
Have you had breakfast yet?

16:25.568 --> 16:28.947
You know, I'm warning you,
you're wasting your time.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.908
Sit down, Craig.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.328
How's business. Slow?

16:36.705 --> 16:38.123
Thriving.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.543
Now!

16:42.335 --> 16:44.379
Whoa! Nice!

16:45.714 --> 16:47.799
So how's your brother's beak?

16:48.258 --> 16:50.552
Who told you Ernesto is my brother?

16:51.386 --> 16:52.595
Thank you.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.848
How did you find me, the Yellow Pages?

16:54.973 --> 16:57.559
I know almost everything about you.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.979
Captain Craig James McCenzie.

17:01.104 --> 17:05.817
Twenty-three special ops and not
one soldier dead under your command.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.028
You were a legend.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.989
And then you were court-martialed
for insubordination

17:11.114 --> 17:13.366
and unbecoming conduct.
- That's old news.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.993
And dishonorably discharged.
- No, no, no.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.039
There's nothing dishonorable about
saving your best friend's testicles.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.041
Your unit was disbanded in disgrace.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.086
I can just imagine how many
people told you thanks for that

17:25.211 --> 17:28.798
Just one guy, and his
wife. That's plenty for me.

17:28.923 --> 17:31.676
Look, thank you for the breakfast, but,

17:31.801 --> 17:33.928
I got some things I gotta do.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.518
You lost everything because of this man.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.854
Carter Mason.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.274
All right, look, no more games.
Who the hell do you work for?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.777
We're not playing
games. We need your help.

17:48.902 --> 17:52.906
And you need the money. Your
friend, Captain Reed, needs it.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.575
I am through with fighting.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.703
That's good. Because we don't
need you to kill anybody.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.414
We need you to make
sure nobody gets killed.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.208
You want me to protect him?

18:03.333 --> 18:06.377
No, we need you to protect
some people from him.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.804
And this man is Colonel Lupo.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.055
Nice casting.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.686
In Eastern Europe, by the
northern seaboard of the Black Sea,

18:23.812 --> 18:27.315
is Ostriv Zmiinyi, also
known as Snake Island.

18:28.024 --> 18:31.694
Its mountains are rich in
minerals and rare Earth metals.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.199
During the Cold War, there was
an Allied military base there.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.620
Now nobody knows who owns
it, Romania or Ukraine.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.914
So it's no man's land.

18:43.706 --> 18:48.086
Colonel Lupo seized power there four
years ago with a mercenary force.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.755
His head of security is Mason.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.469
Colonel Lupo's regime
is brutal and oppressive.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.767
They kill anyone who dares
to speak up against Lupo.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.979
There is a resistance,

19:06.104 --> 19:08.314
but we don't have the weapons to fight.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.525
Our freedom fighters have been unable

19:10.650 --> 19:12.610
to resist Colonel Lupo's mercenaries.

19:12.735 --> 19:16.156
All, criminals on the
run. The scum of the Earth.

19:16.281 --> 19:20.076
They make life a living hell
for the people of Ostriv Zmiinyi.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.911
So, who's the girl?

19:22.036 --> 19:23.413
That's Magda,

19:23.538 --> 19:25.373
she's Colonel Lupo's daughter,

19:25.498 --> 19:28.209
and the only person he cares for.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.253
She's pure evil.

19:39.637 --> 19:43.224
As long as Lupo finds buyers
for the island's metals

19:43.349 --> 19:48.479
he can finance his mercenaries
and brutalize the people.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.858
All right, so those are the bad guys.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.194
Who are the good guys? You?

19:56.446 --> 20:00.325
I was born on the island.
I want to set it free.

20:00.783 --> 20:04.370
The resistance is dying,
but now there is hope.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.623
Ernesto and I

20:06.748 --> 20:10.043
have found five very rich
men who are willing to help.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.922
You know something, lady?
I've never met a rich guy

20:14.047 --> 20:16.216
who's willing to give
away something for nothing.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.343
What do your backers
want for their money?

20:19.510 --> 20:21.596
Kicks and thrills.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.808
With our Soldiers of
Fortune Adventure Program,

20:25.934 --> 20:29.896
we've set up a basic training
camp for our clients in Romania.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.190
With their charitable contributions,

20:32.315 --> 20:36.444
we've purchased the firepower
to finally resist Colonel Lupo.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.991
Ernesto leased a ship
to transport the weapons.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.118
We know that Lupo's mercenaries

20:44.244 --> 20:47.538
do not patrol the uninhabited
east side of the island.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.750
Our financiers'
adventure mission will be

20:50.875 --> 20:53.169
to escort the weapons to shore

20:53.294 --> 20:55.463
and get them to the resistance base camp

20:55.588 --> 20:58.299
protected by bodyguards at all times.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.551
Wait a second, let me get this straight.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.179
You and Ernesto are
pimping out your revolution

21:03.304 --> 21:05.890
as some kind of tourist attraction
for a bunch of millionaires,

21:06.015 --> 21:08.226
and you expect me to be your guide?

21:08.351 --> 21:10.687
Yes. We need your credentials

21:10.812 --> 21:13.856
to assure our clients of their safety.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.943
One last op, Craig.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.237
You're lucky in war,
you said so yourself.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.864
With you, everybody comes home.

21:28.246 --> 21:32.333
Our clients will never be
near actual combat, Craig.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.128
And you can save your friend's home.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.922
And everybody will be happy.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.193
Our wealthy warriors have arrived.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.237
Tell me what we're dealing with.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.824
The first of our soldiers of fortune

22:05.033 --> 22:07.201
is Charles Herbert Vanderbeer.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.663
Vanderbeer is a genuine
American aristocrat.

22:10.788 --> 22:14.208
One of his ancestors bought
Manhattan from a drunk Indian

22:14.334 --> 22:16.836
for twenty-four silver dollars
and a bottle of moonshine.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.047
Vanderbeer runs a
Wall Street hedge fund.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.174
He made a fortune from subprime loans,

22:21.299 --> 22:23.509
and then another from the bank bailout.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.971
It's a shame a lot of ordinary
folks lost their homes,

22:27.096 --> 22:28.765
but that's Wall Street for you.

22:28.890 --> 22:32.560
The rich get richer and
the poor can go to hell.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.771
I'm gonna enjoy watching him under fire.

22:34.896 --> 22:38.900
Our second millionaire is Roman
St.John. A metals magnate.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.196
St. John traded vodka and
bluejeans on the black market

22:43.321 --> 22:45.031
before the Berlin Wall fell.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.949
And then, in the anarchy
that followed somehow

22:47.075 --> 22:50.453
all his business rivals got
murdered but he survived

22:51.537 --> 22:54.415
Now he owns a huge
mining and smelting empire

22:54.540 --> 22:56.959
and lives the life of
an international playboy.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.588
He was last sighted off the
coast of Somalia, fishing.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.883
St.John does have
practical weapons exposure,

23:05.885 --> 23:09.555
but he claims, without any
verifiable military record

23:11.349 --> 23:15.103
that he has experience leading
troops in naval warfare.

23:15.686 --> 23:20.817
He demanded an entourage
of five. He settled for one.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.903
Our next client is Sam Haussmann.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.740
I've heard of this guy.
- Who hasn't?

23:28.491 --> 23:31.953
A cell phone pioneer and a
permanent resident on Forbes List.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.705
Haussmann's lived enough
for three ordinary men.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.878
He's been married five
times, he has eight kids.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.383
He's made two huge
fortunes and lost one.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.552
He's climbed Everest and fought bulls

23:47.677 --> 23:49.595
and hunted every kind of big game.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.973
Even three species that are now extinct.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.643
And he's beaten two major
heart attacks, as well.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.484
And now for the bad. Our fourth client.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.445
The Grim Reaper.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.324
Grimaud Tourneur. Born in French Africa.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.494
Very little is known about this
international man of mystery,

24:13.786 --> 24:16.831
before becoming the world's
most notorious arms dealer.

24:18.416 --> 24:22.295
Our angel of death sold weapons to
both sides in the civil war in Sudan.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.630
Then he started a revolution in Congo

24:24.755 --> 24:26.549
just to peddle more guns.

24:26.883 --> 24:30.386
Grimaud makes even mercenaries
seem like Sisters of Mercy.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.430
He's a profiteer of war,

24:32.555 --> 24:35.057
but he's never participated in one.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.852
He's selling our new friends
their weapons, as well.

24:38.060 --> 24:42.148
And finally, at the bottom of
the barrel, we have Tommy Sin.

24:43.316 --> 24:48.321
Sin is the creator of Death Porn,
the mega-violent fantasy video game.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.575
Five teenagers decapitated their parents

24:52.700 --> 24:54.702
after playing his smash hit game.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.538
But each time Sin is accused
of incitement to murder

24:57.663 --> 24:58.873
he's acquitted.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.667
Sin probably thinks
war is just a game, too.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.420
Apart from his addiction to video games,

25:06.005 --> 25:08.508
this lunatic just broke his leg.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.781
Welcome to our training camp, gentlemen.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.867
I'm Captain McCenzie,
this is Captain Reed.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.537
These five men are going
to be your bodyguards.

25:37.662 --> 25:39.872
You will obey their every command.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.542
Whose buck is this?

25:42.667 --> 25:46.212
How about they obey our orders?

25:46.712 --> 25:49.090
If any of them is going
to be my bodyguard,

25:49.215 --> 25:52.176
it is they who need
the training, not me.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.137
Yes, sir, Captain, sir.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.223
Three bags full, sir.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.020
The barracks over there are
going to be your accommodations.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.480
Uh, excuse me.

26:04.605 --> 26:08.067
Uh, I trust we all have
our own rooms. I mean...

26:10.361 --> 26:12.321
Over the next few
days you're gonna learn

26:12.446 --> 26:14.532
how to survive in a hot zone.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.075
Just remember,

26:16.200 --> 26:19.120
the only thing worse in action
than a coward is a hero. You got it?

26:19.745 --> 26:22.582
Now, go stow your bags. Dismissed.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.418
Oh, hey, uh, General? Uh, Colonel?

26:25.543 --> 26:30.464
Can, uh, can someone carry my
bag for me, 'cause my leg's done.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.844
I can't I can't carry it.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.346
Got a bum leg!

26:43.185 --> 26:44.895
Jesus!

26:51.152 --> 26:54.655
Jesus Christ. No, I told you
about the fucking pharmacy.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.844
Oh, it's like that, huh?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.812
Helen and I will take the dining room.

27:46.082 --> 27:49.502
What you playing there, son?
- Baby Killer. On the top level.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.629
I'm in the maternity ward.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.638
Hey, Grimaud, can you feel it?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.473
Feel what?

28:02.598 --> 28:04.392
The thrill of being a kid again.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.561
Playing war games with
pop guns in your backyard.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.605
This isn't a kids' game.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.983
We're playing with real weapons now.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.281
The Grim Reaper.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.910
Hmm, big gun.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.995
It's small.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.706
Son, you know

28:26.831 --> 28:29.208
it's not the size of
your gun that matters,

28:29.333 --> 28:31.168
it's where you stick it.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.046
Let me show you a real hunter's weapon.

28:34.588 --> 28:38.300
Now this, here, is Irene.

28:38.426 --> 28:39.927
Irene's a bitch.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.389
She would have sniped that Grim
Reaper of yours at a thousand yards

28:43.514 --> 28:45.766
before you even knew she was there.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.893
Oh, that's nice. May I?
- Yeah, sure.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.228
Oh, thanks!

28:59.822 --> 29:01.323
What're you doing?

29:02.783 --> 29:04.285
Idiot.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.455
You know,

29:07.580 --> 29:10.541
I lost twenty-million dollars

29:10.666 --> 29:13.461
when Lehman Brothers
collapsed on Wall Street.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.213
Sucker

29:16.338 --> 29:17.506
Uh, yeah?

29:17.631 --> 29:19.842
Screw you, too, banker.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.722
Screw you, too, game boy.

29:25.806 --> 29:28.684
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Simmer
down! Simmer down now, boys.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.269
Take it easy, big fella.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.689
How about we have a party

29:33.814 --> 29:36.984
to celebrate you two
losing your cherries.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.111
I agree.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.464
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

29:59.048 --> 30:00.633
Cheers.
<i>-</i> Here's mud in your eye.

30:08.974 --> 30:13.229
1975! Damn, that was a vintage year.

30:13.354 --> 30:15.147
Was she that pretty, Sam?

30:15.272 --> 30:19.777
Yeah, well, whatever she was,
she's probably a grandmother by now.

30:20.444 --> 30:21.862
Here's to good living!

30:21.987 --> 30:24.657
And a quick death.
<i>-</i> Cheers, Sam.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.661
Champagne, sir?

30:31.831 --> 30:32.998
Thank you.

30:42.675 --> 30:46.637
I bet you I kill more
bad guys than you do.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.019
Make it a hundred grand and you're on.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.730
A hundred thousand? Deal.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.108
I bet a million bucks

30:59.233 --> 31:01.026
you both get blue balls.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.280
Neither of you are man
enough to kill a man for real.

31:05.698 --> 31:09.368
It's a draw.

31:11.996 --> 31:14.707
I hate a party when I'm not invited.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.834
Let 'em have their fun.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.086
We're getting paid, aren't we?

31:19.962 --> 31:21.755
You know, those bastards are right.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.341
Their bodyguards do need to train.

31:28.429 --> 31:32.349
You look like an angel. An
angel when you're dancing, angel.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.772
How is your hedge fund?

31:39.899 --> 31:41.275
Fine.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.528
Why do you ask?

31:47.698 --> 31:49.033
Nothing.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.744
I just heard some rumors, that's all.

31:52.161 --> 31:56.457
You know, how when the tide
goes out, the wrecks get exposed?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.044
Nonsense.

32:00.628 --> 32:04.423
Ich mag die Art, wie du dich
bewegst, Méidchen. Oh, du bewegst mich.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.927
Hey!
Videoboy!

32:18.979 --> 32:20.814
Damn. We're being attacked!

32:22.608 --> 32:24.026
Let's make a run for it.

32:38.749 --> 32:41.961
Gentlemen! Your throats
have all been cut.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.090
Sorry to interrupt your party,

32:46.215 --> 32:49.927
but, after all, you did say that
your bodyguards do need to train.

32:50.219 --> 32:52.388
Thank you, bodyguards.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.769
Now at least we know who
the most vulnerable are.

32:58.894 --> 33:01.647
Vanderbeer and Sin will be
killed on our first contact.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.191
Grim doesn't stand much of a chance.

33:04.316 --> 33:09.029
And, uh, Haussmann and St.John,
I don't see them lasting very long.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.532
Thank you, gentlemen.
If anybody is interested,

33:11.657 --> 33:13.701
training begins
at oh-six-hundred

33:13.826 --> 33:17.121
That's, like, six in
the morning, isn't it?

33:26.505 --> 33:29.008
Do you think your adrenalin
junkies will show up?

33:29.383 --> 33:31.885
If they don't, let's just go home.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.597
I got a bad feeling
about this op, anyway.

33:37.474 --> 33:38.934
Oh, shit.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.443
What happened to your lady?

33:48.152 --> 33:52.740
I, uh, I sent her away.
It's time for business.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.703
What about you? Huh? What
did you do with your valet?

33:57.828 --> 34:01.206
I, uh, gave him a vacation.

34:03.667 --> 34:08.630
He's been asking for, uh, well, years.

34:13.677 --> 34:16.679
All right, let's get started.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.308
Drop and give me fifty.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.103
Drop!

34:28.609 --> 34:30.902
There you go, boys. Kiss that anthill.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.869
Come on, Grim! Come
on, Grim! Let's move it.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.081
Come on, kick ass! Let's go, Vanderbeer.

34:42.206 --> 34:46.001
Now, Haussmann, get your ass
over that wall. Let's go! Come on!

34:46.126 --> 34:49.379
Move it! Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

34:49.505 --> 34:51.297
Move your ass! Move your ass!

35:14.029 --> 35:16.949
Come on, Haussmann, move your
ass! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

35:17.241 --> 35:18.617
What's that noise?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.953
What are you doing?
What the hell is that?

35:21.078 --> 35:22.496
Is that a phone?

35:22.621 --> 35:25.165
Hey, Alma. What did you do now?

35:31.296 --> 35:33.590
Hang up that phone! Hang up that phone!

35:33.715 --> 35:34.675
Uh, I'll call you back.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.928
You do that again, I'll kill
you myself. Come on! Move it!

35:38.053 --> 35:39.930
You're moving like a senior citizen.

35:40.222 --> 35:43.684
Come on, Vanderbeer. Your
valet's not here to do it for you.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.678
Work with your bodyguards.

37:03.347 --> 37:04.473
Protect the money!

37:05.807 --> 37:08.018
Hello?
<i>-</i> Another cell phone addict?

37:08.143 --> 37:10.646
You're all dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

37:10.771 --> 37:13.190
Pathetic! Pathetic!

37:13.774 --> 37:16.526
Now, gentlemen, the rules are simple.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.779
Protect your ﬂag at all costs,

37:18.904 --> 37:21.156
and capture theirs.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.451
And try to work together as a team.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.537
Shoot at anyone with a green armband.

37:28.330 --> 37:31.500
Vanderbeer, you stay in the
bunker and protect the ﬂag.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.378
St. John, Sin, you ﬂank left.

37:34.503 --> 37:36.755
Me and Haussmann will ﬂank right.

37:47.557 --> 37:48.725
All, right.

37:48.850 --> 37:52.521
Let's see what you wealthy
warriors are made of.

37:57.276 --> 38:00.362
What is wrong with you?
You must obey my orders.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.489
Since when is this your command?
- Since now.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.409
I am the one with the most
military experience here.

38:05.534 --> 38:06.285
Son,

38:06.410 --> 38:09.496
just because you peddle a lot of
guns to a bunch of tin-pot dictators,

38:09.621 --> 38:12.374
that don't make you our leader.
<i>-</i> Don't call me "son," old man.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.751
You're not my father.
- How do you know?

38:15.419 --> 38:16.837
I should be in charge!

38:16.962 --> 38:19.464
My last game, War Whore,
sold fifty-million units.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.341
That's five-zero.
<i>-</i> So what?

38:21.466 --> 38:23.760
My great great uncle was a
general in two World Wars.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.888
I should be in command.
<i>-</i> Oh, wow, your uncle was in a war.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.724
That must mean you're
an incredible warrior.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.685
Look, that makes no sense.

38:33.186 --> 38:36.481
Why don't we take off these helmets
and I'll punch you in the throat?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.693
I'm not obeying a virgin.
<i>-</i> Who are you calling a virgin?

38:39.818 --> 38:42.112
You've never killed a man, have you?

38:43.113 --> 38:46.033
That's what men are made
for. Fighting, not fucking.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.328
Maybe I'll shoot you
just to pop my cherry.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.414
You just try it. And I'll
cut your bourgeois throat.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.124
Come on, try it.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.172
Excuse me, ladies.

39:00.297 --> 39:02.257
Hey, where are you going?

39:04.426 --> 39:06.428
I've got nothing to
prove to you pussies.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.138
I signed up for a fight.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.773
Ah! Not my face!

39:55.560 --> 39:58.063
Now, that's what I
call a hostile takeover.

39:58.188 --> 40:01.817
You know the only rule in
life? You've got to win.

40:02.359 --> 40:03.777
We won!

40:03.985 --> 40:05.529
We're dead, but we won!

40:24.381 --> 40:25.841
Come on, come on! Through the tires

40:25.966 --> 40:28.176
Come on! Come on! Move it!

40:28.301 --> 40:29.803
All right.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.767
Come on! Come on! Come
on! Come on! Keep moving!

40:36.643 --> 40:37.978
No, no. Right in there.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.566
I know you've got a
bum leg. I don't care!

40:42.691 --> 40:44.776
I don't care. You signed
up for this, didn't you?

40:53.910 --> 40:56.288
Get through there. Hop over it.

40:56.413 --> 40:58.290
There you go.

41:01.084 --> 41:03.462
All right. Good.

41:05.714 --> 41:08.467
Come on, Grim! Come
on, Grim! Let's move it!

41:08.758 --> 41:11.636
Let's see why they call
you the killer. Let's go!

41:12.304 --> 41:13.680
Cover the money!

41:15.265 --> 41:17.267
Good. Good.

41:32.574 --> 41:34.659
Game over.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.119
Gentlemen,

41:36.244 --> 41:40.457
tomorrow we leave for Snake
Island. For your own safety,

41:40.582 --> 41:43.710
all of your personal possessions
are now going to be collected.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.379
Place them in this bag.

41:46.505 --> 41:47.881
Anything you can think of

41:48.006 --> 41:50.550
hat can be used to
positively identify you.

41:50.675 --> 41:55.222
Cell phones, documents, wallets.
You're not taking anything with you.

41:55.639 --> 41:59.392
Until our mission is complete
you will have no names.

42:00.018 --> 42:03.480
Come on, move it, Vanderbeer.
Put your cell phone in there.

42:07.526 --> 42:10.320
Now get some shut eye. We
leave at oh-five-hundred.

42:40.517 --> 42:42.269
How long until we take off, Captain?

42:42.394 --> 42:45.021
As soon as we're done
loading the weapons.

42:48.650 --> 42:50.485
All right, guys, let's
keep loading up boxes.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.779
Hurry up! Move it! Move it!

43:34.988 --> 43:36.948
Aw! Come on, kid.

43:51.755 --> 43:54.549
Five minutes to landing.
- Roger that.

44:03.516 --> 44:05.018
We've got a problem, buddy.

44:05.143 --> 44:06.770
I hear you. Where's it coming from?

44:06.895 --> 44:09.105
Okay, take her out. Fire!

44:18.031 --> 44:19.491
Beautiful.

44:19.783 --> 44:20.909
Craig, it's getting hot!

44:21.034 --> 44:22.494
What the hell is going on, Captain?

44:22.619 --> 44:25.705
She said this shoreline
was safe. Lying bitch!

44:32.921 --> 44:35.298
Give them a scare. Fire!

44:47.352 --> 44:49.229
Look who we have here.

44:49.354 --> 44:50.438
Again!

44:57.904 --> 44:59.072
Spin the wheel!

44:59.197 --> 45:01.324
I know how we can beat the system.

45:01.449 --> 45:02.742
What are you talking about?

45:02.867 --> 45:05.495
The shells take five seconds to arrive.

45:06.162 --> 45:09.958
The fire-control computer projects
target movement five seconds ahead.

45:10.291 --> 45:13.420
If you zigzag fast enough
you can beat the computer.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.755
All right, Mike. Zigzag.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.091
Zigzag. Head for the coast.

45:18.216 --> 45:19.676
Head for the coast!

45:53.084 --> 45:55.044
Port-side boat. Fire!

46:02.594 --> 46:03.678
Mike!

46:04.262 --> 46:05.638
Mike!

46:17.275 --> 46:19.235
Get down. Get down!

46:33.208 --> 46:36.211
Okay, grab whatever gear you can
and take cover in those rocks.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.300
Come on! Come on!

46:42.425 --> 46:44.260
Welcome to Snake Island, gentlemen.

46:44.385 --> 46:46.387
You may never leave.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.681
Come on, come on! Move
it! Move it! Move it!

46:50.642 --> 46:51.893
Fire.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.368
God damn!

47:08.493 --> 47:10.662
That'll pucker your rear end.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.874
Any injuries?
- No.

47:22.799 --> 47:24.217
This is Tommy Sin.

47:25.218 --> 47:27.470
Didn't I say no cell phones?

47:30.139 --> 47:31.641
And you, how much are you getting?

47:31.766 --> 47:33.726
What are they paying
you? My friends are dead!

47:33.852 --> 47:36.062
Grimaud Tourneur does
not sell people out.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.647
Well, then how did you
know about that cannon?

47:37.772 --> 47:41.192
I sold it to Colonel
Lupo. He didn't pay me.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.486
That's why I'm on this trip.

47:43.611 --> 47:46.197
To kill him or get paid.

47:46.614 --> 47:49.117
The Grim Reaper always gets paid.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.744
Come on. Come on! Move it! Move it!

47:51.870 --> 47:53.329
Cover! Cover!

48:04.757 --> 48:07.510
You! You said the sea
route would be safe.

48:07.635 --> 48:10.430
Because of you, my men are dead.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.234
I knew you were bad news.

48:24.652 --> 48:27.155
Before I met you, I never
lost a man under my command.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.325
What am I supposed to do
with your precious sponsors?

48:35.622 --> 48:37.707
Fulfill your contract.

48:38.917 --> 48:40.627
Lead them to safety.

48:47.133 --> 48:49.802
These men need your skills now, Craig.

48:50.219 --> 48:53.056
Their survival is in your hands

48:58.978 --> 49:01.272
Once we get to the resistance base camp,

49:01.397 --> 49:04.776
Ernesto can arrange
for their evacuation.

49:10.740 --> 49:11.950
Come on.

49:33.846 --> 49:35.515
Let's get the fuck off this island.

49:35.682 --> 49:37.266
Grimaud, give me your cell phone.

49:37.392 --> 49:39.394
But you wanted to kill man-prey.

49:39.519 --> 49:41.562
You haven't completed your mission.

49:41.688 --> 49:43.815
Yeah, that's very clever.
Give me your cell phone.

49:44.273 --> 49:45.483
I don't have one.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.652
Hey, Sam. Do you have a cell phone?

49:48.528 --> 49:52.031
Now, son, I know things
aren't going according to plan,

49:52.949 --> 49:55.743
but Sam Haussmann didn't come all
this way just to turn tail and run.

49:55.868 --> 49:57.870
And I'm not sure using a cell phone

49:57.996 --> 50:00.164
is such a swift idea, either.

50:00.832 --> 50:02.792
This isn't what we paid for!

50:08.756 --> 50:10.133
How you holding up, Sam?

50:10.258 --> 50:12.927
Getting old, Captain. Slowing down.

50:13.052 --> 50:15.096
Enjoy it while you can, Captain.

50:15.221 --> 50:17.598
You're a long time gone.

50:25.106 --> 50:27.316
I'm hungry. What have we got to eat?

50:27.442 --> 50:28.943
We eat at the camp.

50:29.777 --> 50:32.655
Just remember, I'm on
a low-carb diet, okay?

50:52.633 --> 50:54.177
It's over.

50:54.302 --> 50:57.013
Without those weapons, we
can't resist any longer.

50:59.140 --> 51:01.517
Tomorrow, you'll evacuate our sponsors.

51:01.726 --> 51:05.563
I'll find us a boat. You'll be
paid in full for your services

51:16.657 --> 51:19.077
Definitely not low-carb.

51:19.535 --> 51:21.496
I should have brought my chef.

51:21.871 --> 51:25.166
Charlie, why the hell did you
pay to come on this mission?

51:25.291 --> 51:27.585
Just so's you could
whine about everything?

51:27.835 --> 51:29.670
Bragging rights.

51:30.213 --> 51:34.133
Such is life on the street. Wall Street.

51:36.177 --> 51:37.762
He who dares, wins.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.267
We already know why Grimaud's here.

51:43.935 --> 51:46.646
He's being shot at
with his own merchandise

51:47.105 --> 51:49.107
and he hasn't been paid for it.

51:53.319 --> 51:55.154
Why are you here, Tommy?

51:57.073 --> 51:58.407
Doctor's orders.

51:58.866 --> 52:03.287
My psychiatrist said that I am
addicted to shooter video games.

52:03.913 --> 52:06.666
She suggested a dose of healthy reality.

52:07.416 --> 52:10.086
So you're here to feel the real?

52:12.839 --> 52:15.466
All right, that takes
care of the logistics.

52:16.175 --> 52:20.012
But I'm not leaving this island
until we figure out one thing.

52:20.429 --> 52:22.557
Why my men were killed.

52:23.141 --> 52:24.725
Somebody talked.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.979
If I were you, I would
move this base right now.

52:28.271 --> 52:29.939
How about you, Sam?

52:30.773 --> 52:34.277
Well, Sam just wants to hang a
human head in his trophy cabinet.

52:35.069 --> 52:37.446
I don't plan on going home.

52:38.573 --> 52:42.076
My present wife, I just
call her "number five,"

52:42.201 --> 52:43.870
she's suing me for divorce.

52:43.995 --> 52:48.624
And according to that prenuptial bullshit
I was an fool in love enough to sign,

52:48.958 --> 52:51.794
if we split, she gets
half of everything I own.

52:51.919 --> 52:56.299
Whereas, if I get killed, my
kids inherit the whole she-bang.

52:57.717 --> 52:59.594
Hell, I've already
survived two heart attacks

52:59.719 --> 53:02.847
I've done pretty much everything
there is to do on this old planet.

53:02.972 --> 53:05.141
And I've enjoyed the
hell out of it, too.

53:05.266 --> 53:08.436
No, this here is all there is.

53:12.690 --> 53:15.818
I say we stay here for the
night, break camp in the morning.

53:15.943 --> 53:19.197
Okay, fine, that's your choice.
But I'm taking my men out of here.

53:19.739 --> 53:21.824
At least what's left of them.

53:23.743 --> 53:25.244
Die in battle...

53:27.580 --> 53:30.458
That's a hell of a way
to screw a gold-digger.

53:31.667 --> 53:33.377
And what are your reasons?

53:46.390 --> 53:48.935
Get your things, we're
getting the hell out of here.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.386
Yes!

54:23.511 --> 54:25.596
Oh, we got 'em, we got 'em.

54:26.264 --> 54:27.390
Here, take a look.

54:28.015 --> 54:31.519
Ernesto!
<i>-</i> Cecilia, save yourself!

54:53.374 --> 54:55.334
Okay, left ﬂank, move in. Wipe 'em out.

55:07.305 --> 55:08.931
What's up, Captain?

55:10.683 --> 55:13.352
You wanted to see what war
looks like? Take a look.

55:36.751 --> 55:38.919
All right, wait here. Don't
give way your position.

55:39.045 --> 55:40.504
Hey, where you going?

55:58.439 --> 56:00.358
Get the bitch!

56:36.519 --> 56:39.855
Jesus, they're getting
torn to shreds down there.

57:08.342 --> 57:11.262
So this is what our money bought us?

57:11.470 --> 57:15.266
To play war safely, from a distance?

57:17.017 --> 57:19.186
So, we're going to just hide?

57:19.770 --> 57:22.523
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

57:24.775 --> 57:26.777
Let's go kill some bad guys.

57:26.902 --> 57:30.239
We start firing, they'll
spot our position.

57:32.032 --> 57:36.912
Shoot, you can't bake a cake
without breaking some eggs.

57:53.345 --> 57:54.430
Jackpot!

57:54.555 --> 57:57.516
There's a sniper! There! There!
The enemy sniper, you see him?

58:05.941 --> 58:08.194
The Grim Reaper is next.

58:46.232 --> 58:48.317
Come on. Come on.

58:58.285 --> 58:59.703
Incoming!

59:28.440 --> 59:29.275
What the fuck happened?

59:29.400 --> 59:31.485
Which one of you is responsible
for giving away our position?

59:31.610 --> 59:34.738
Seemed to me our friends
down there needed some help.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.004
Where's Vanderbeer?

59:50.129 --> 59:52.298
Last time I saw him he was in the...

59:53.799 --> 59:55.593
Looks like I won that bet.

59:55.718 --> 59:57.970
It's a bet, you'll never call in.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:01.098
Shit! Come on, come on!
Move it! Move it! Follow me.

01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:03.809
Come!

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:37.885
Everybody behind the tree. Take cover!

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.905
Can they see us?
<i>-</i> Sin, stay down!

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:01.450
Where is that chopper coming from?

01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:05.162
I said, where is that
chopper coming from?

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:07.414
Cecilia, you've got to snap out of it!

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:10.584
That helicopter's coming from
a helipad that serves the mines

01:01:12.795 --> 01:01:14.713
It's about three kilometers from here.

01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:01.427
How do you know about this base?

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.973
I used to play in these
woods when I was a boy.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.393
My father served here
during the Cold War.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.187
And what do they mine here? Gold?

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.066
Coltan.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:19.194
It's a rare Earth metal.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:23.365
And you trade metals, don't you?
- Yes.

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:27.870
You want to tell us
now why you are here?

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:31.290
Business with Colonel Lupo.

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:33.792
I need that metal.
- Business?

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:37.463
You bastard.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:41.425
People died because of your business.

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:44.094
We all believed you wanted
to help free this island.

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:48.015
Maybe it's you. You who
betrayed us for fucking money.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.939
Your greed has left you
with blood on your hands.

01:03:04.323 --> 01:03:05.783
Here.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.085
Wait here until I get back.

01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:32.392
Cecilia!

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:36.772
It's too exposed up here.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.858
We've got to get back to the group.

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:50.994
Look, I'm sorry about your brother.

01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:53.747
And I'm sorry about your friends.

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:57.000
But there is nothing I
can do to bring them back.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.256
Just like there's nothing
I can do to bring back mine.

01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:14.059
Boys, this is our chance.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:19.356
Sam, do you think you
can pilot that thing?

01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:22.693
Piece of cake.

01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:27.823
Let's wait for Craig.

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:30.617
It's a trap. I can smell it.

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:33.620
We capture it. We wait for them there.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.789
You really want to die on this island?

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.042
Any moment now, that
chopper could take off again.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.628
What do you say, gentlemen?

01:04:42.004 --> 01:04:43.964
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.465
I'm in.

01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:47.718
Let's do it.
<i>-</i> Come on.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.305
Let's go.

01:05:10.032 --> 01:05:11.408
Craig.

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:54.952
See how easy it is to
trap fools like you?

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.537
All you need is the right bait.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:05:59.957
Take them away!

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:12.010
Those stupid bags of money.

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.139
Oh,Jesus Christ

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:47.170
What is this place?

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.589
It was a NATO base during the Cold War.

01:06:49.715 --> 01:06:51.883
The whole mountain is
tunneled out from the inside.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.177
Nice tomb.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:56.555
Think we'll ever get out of here alive?

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.271
Hello again!

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.318
Your accommodation awaits.

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.117
Nice here, huh?

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:19.077
Private pool.

01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:21.455
Room service

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.416
Concierge.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:30.088
Touch me again and I'll kill you.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.299
Thank God, you're here!

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:35.218
Charlie!

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:41.058
Hey, Tommy.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:44.269
I don't believe it.

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:48.106
Hey, Sam. Hey, buddy.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.816
Well, we thought you were dead.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:52.486
Me? Dead?

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.446
Of course not.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:07:59.409
So what happened to you?

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:01.286
Well, I don't know about you guys,

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:03.997
but I have never been so
scared in my whole life.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.418
I go outside to take a piss

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:14.591
and then all the shells started dropping
and the sound and the noise and the smoke.

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.635
I got completely disoriented.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.845
I did not know where the fuck I was.

01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:24.600
So I eventually found my way back and
the tent was destroyed you guys had gone,

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:26.603
and soldiers came and...

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.688
Now here I am.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.442
Does anyone have a cell phone?
- No.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.984
Just hoping.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:38.448
Hey, Charlie. Have you got any of
those fancy cigars of yours left?

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:41.493
Sure, Sam.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:45.913
Hey, Tommy, what happened
to our Captain and that girl?

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:49.167
Oh, he is...
<i>-</i> They are dead.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.590
Yeah. Dead.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:57.300
Yeah.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.719
Do you mind if I have one of those?

01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:00.929
Of course not.
- Thanks.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.140
Only fifty bucks a smoke.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.438
So, uh, how did they get killed?

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:11.648
Tank shell.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.901
Kapowl Boom! Awful.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:18.738
I think I've still got some of
the Captain in my hair, Charlie.

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.171
Well, some trip this
turned out to be, huh?

01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:39.134
What are you looking at?

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:56.610
Open up!

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.069
Open up!

01:09:58.195 --> 01:10:00.488
You fucking piece of piss.

01:10:00.906 --> 01:10:02.616
You sold us out!

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:07.120
Yeah, well. Big deal.

01:10:08.747 --> 01:10:10.081
Get over it.

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.667
I'm going to kick your ass.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:30.435
Eat shit and die, old man.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.896
Fucking hell. Okay.

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:37.859
You can inform Colonel Lupe

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:41.363
that Captain McCenzie
and the girl are dead.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.365
Satisfied?

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.956
Ooh, the wild bunch.

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:54.668
So, you see, gentlemen,

01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:58.338
we do know who you really are.

01:11:02.384 --> 01:11:03.760
Mr. Sin.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:08.556
I always wanted to be a nemesis
character in one of your video games.

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:13.687
Why would anyone want to play
a tin-pot criminal like you

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:16.231
in one of my video games?

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:20.694
Because he can get to do shit like this.

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:25.448
That's why!

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:29.744
He shot me in the leg!

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.962
We can stay dry under here.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.011
Think there are any snakes in here?

01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:48.221
No.Just me.

01:11:50.849 --> 01:11:53.435
I'm sorry for this
challenging assignment.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.769
I'm all in.

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:57.105
Now we get to save the others.
- What do you mean?

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.774
Well, what did you think I was
gonna do, leave them all here to die?

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:09.826
Come on, Sam!
<i>-</i> Yeah.

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:11.244
Breathe hard, Sam.

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:12.579
Breathe hard. That's it.

01:12:12.704 --> 01:12:15.957
Well, you wanted to
feel the real game, boy.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:17.917
Now you know.

01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:19.794
It hurts.

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:24.007
How does it look? Am I going to die?

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.259
Yes.
<i>-</i> What?

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:30.847
Someday. But not from
this little scratch.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.935
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right.
- Hold him down.

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:37.854
I'm okay. I'm okay, I'm all right.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:40.607
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:44.736
1899. I saved the best for last.

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:46.488
It's a goddamn shame

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:49.324
to waste good cognac on a ﬂesh wound.

01:12:52.077 --> 01:12:53.912
Here you go, son.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.247
Have a little hair of the goat.

01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:10.470
Is it finished?
- Yes, yes.

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:12.180
Is it over?
- Yeah.

01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:14.766
You should put that around your neck.

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:39.374
Go!

01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:49.342
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:51.469
We're looking well this morning.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:54.305
Come on, come on, line 'em
up. We've got business.

01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:17.745
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:21.291
I trust you've got no illusions
as to why you're still alive.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.627
Half of your net worth.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.505
That's my price for
letting each of you go.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.467
Once we agree,

01:14:30.592 --> 01:14:35.555
my new financial consultant
will work out the details.

01:14:39.559 --> 01:14:41.519
And if we don't agree?

01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:45.356
Then where you are going,

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:48.526
you don't get to take anything with you.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:55.867
The Grim Reaper always
gets paid. You owe me.

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.413
And what about you, old man?

01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:04.000
Old enough to know
bullshit when I step in it.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.177
Would you rather lose
your lives than your money?

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:19.724
Are you rich bastards
really that tight-fisted?

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.526
That's your choice.

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:36.449
Kill this liar first.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.411
And what about me?

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:43.748
I might want to buy an extra life.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.041
Tommy!

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:48.461
We're not in a fucking video
game. This man will kill us.

01:15:50.672 --> 01:15:55.802
Mr. Vanderbeer, how much do
you calculate Mr. Sin is worth?

01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:04.644
My daughter.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.731
Next time, I'll kill you.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.692
Hey, Lupo!

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.239
Hold your fire!

01:16:16.364 --> 01:16:19.993
If you want your daughter
back, you'll let these men go.

01:16:25.707 --> 01:16:27.375
Release the prisoners!

01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:41.889
Go!

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:47.103
Don't shoot!

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:56.404
Secure the base!

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:58.698
I want those bastards killed!

01:16:58.823 --> 01:16:59.907
Come on!

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:02.493
Come here, my darling.
- You heard him. Go!

01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:20.053
Craig!

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:23.139
Cecilia! You go!
We'll find another way.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:25.558
Get the hell out of here!

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.608
That bitch tried to kill me!
- Magda, stop!

01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:35.610
Don't worry. She'll be fine.
- After her!

01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:36.861
Follow me!

01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:45.036
All right, come on. We are
going this way. Go! Go!

01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:51.751
Hey! Where did they
go? Where did they go?

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:53.836
On the right, guys!
On the right! Come on!

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.130
Take this boat back to Colonel Lupo.

01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:59.550
There is no one here. Raise the boom!

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:26.869
You lose.

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.663
Hey, Captain.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.135
This is my merchandise.

01:18:42.844 --> 01:18:44.387
Help yourselves.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:09.996
Shit! We've got to get
the hell out of here!

01:19:10.121 --> 01:19:12.749
If a bullet hits one of those
barrels, we're all dead.

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.042
Give me a push.

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:18.004
What are you gonna do?

01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:20.673
No worries, I'm only
going along for the ride.

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:25.344
Push, god damn it!

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.268
Push! Come on!

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:43.279
Stay down! Stay down!

01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:04.175
You find those guys or I
get the fuck off this island.

01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:05.968
There they are!

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:14.310
Cover me!

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.980
Take him outwith grenades. Okay?
- No!

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:01.065
What do you mean, "no"?
<i>-</i> There are barrels of explosives.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.609
If they ignite, this
whole place will blow up.

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:06.946
Okay, look. You take care of that old
man. I'll see you're well paid for it.

01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:21.544
I'll be back.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.720
Where is everyone going?

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:39.979
Shoot!

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:41.272
Shoot him!

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:01.626
Remember me?

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:05.671
I told you I'd kill you.

01:22:16.349 --> 01:22:18.059
Hey, Tommy.

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:20.686
Looking for somebody?

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.172
Before you kill me, Charlie,

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:52.593
just answer me one thing.
- Yeah.

01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:54.887
Why did you do it?

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:58.349
Nothing personal, Tommy.

01:22:59.016 --> 01:23:00.685
I had no choice.

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:04.647
You see, I knew my hedge
fund was going to crash.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:07.400
I didn't want to spend the
rest of my life in jail,

01:23:07.525 --> 01:23:10.277
so I transferred the
rest of my funds here.

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:14.156
I thought this would make
quite a nice a retirement home.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:16.909
My mistake.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.204
My fucking leg!

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:23.749
Stop messing around, you little junkie.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:27.169
Charlie! Don't do it.

01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:33.134
Video boy! Do it!

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:53.779
Fucking banker!

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:04.832
I hope you guys are long gone.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:15.217
Bye, bye, number five.

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:06.060
Nice! Nice work, frog's legs.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.488
The Grim Reaper always gets paid.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:04.553
Breathe! Come on.

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:44.760
Nice work.

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:58.232
A toast. To Sam Haussmann!

01:27:59.305 --> 01:28:05.617
