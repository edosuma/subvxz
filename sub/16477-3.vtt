WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.506
*

00:08.609 --> 00:12.680
* Don't even think about

00:12.713 --> 00:15.049
* She's running

00:15.083 --> 00:18.819
WOMAN:
Moving up into Tree Pose.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.388
* Don't even think about.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.823
And breathe...

00:22.856 --> 00:25.759
into your sacral chakra.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.063
(gasping)

00:29.097 --> 00:31.065
(yelling)

00:38.106 --> 00:40.108
*

01:09.637 --> 01:11.639
Oh, come on, come on.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.374
Seriously?

01:14.842 --> 01:16.444
Thanks.
Everything all right?

01:16.477 --> 01:20.314
Well, it says $1,800 a month
for a 330 square foot

01:20.348 --> 01:22.216
bachelor apartment--
not even in a great area.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.451
BISHOP:
Sounds about right.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.219
I went through
the same sticker shock

01:25.253 --> 01:26.654
when I was looking
for a new apartment, Nick.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.122
Thought you liked
living at The Oakhurst.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.658
I do, but my
Temporary Quarters Allowance

01:30.691 --> 01:31.859
is up this month.
I have to find a place

01:31.892 --> 01:34.228
that I can actually afford now.

01:34.262 --> 01:37.698
Well, anything nice
is expensive. Trust me.

01:37.731 --> 01:41.469
When I was in Buenos Aires
I had this 2,000 square foot

01:41.502 --> 01:43.471
one-bedroom apartment.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.306
Amazing view of the city,
pool, gym.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.707
Ask me how much it cost.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.876
How much was it?

01:48.909 --> 01:50.544
6,000 pesos.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.413
That's 400 U.S. dollars.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.681
Oh.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.216
Welcome back to reality.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.150
Marine sergeant fell

01:56.184 --> 01:57.885
from the roof
of her apartment building.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.220
Suicide?

01:59.253 --> 02:00.921
The cops think
we should check it out.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.191
She's in critical condition
at Walter Reed.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.124
GIBBS: Quinn and I
are going there.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.859
McGee, take them,
process the building.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.764
(siren wailing)

02:10.798 --> 02:13.234
All right.
Victim is Sergeant Hill.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.935
Lived in the fifth floor
apartment with her sister.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.937
Sister here?
No.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.273
She was at work.
Metro PD notified her.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.575
Bishop, we're gonna need access
to the roof.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.677
On it.

02:25.513 --> 02:29.783
So, um, what do you want me
to do, boss?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.621
Talk to those yoga ladies?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.289
See if they saw anything?
Cool.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.257
No, no, no.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.758
Actually, Metro PD
talked to them already.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.160
They didn't see anything.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.333
All right,
let's go.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.170
Still adjusting?

02:55.276 --> 02:56.710
Wear it when Gibbs is around.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.747
Yeah.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.487
MAN:
After you, ma'am.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.460
(buttons beep, lock buzzes)

03:12.493 --> 03:14.962
Right this way.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.265
We can take the elevator.

03:20.668 --> 03:24.272
All right.
Here we go.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.307
(siren wails in distance)

03:31.845 --> 03:34.282
So how many people
have access to the roof?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.350
Well, all the tenants have keys.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.286
Gets used a lot
in the summer.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.787
Did you see Sergeant Hill
this morning?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.356
No. I was working
in the basement

03:42.390 --> 03:43.891
when I heard the sirens.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.726
I couldn't believe it
when I came outside.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.960
Did you know her?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.028
Not well.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.430
She moved back in

03:49.463 --> 03:51.299
with her sister last month.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.833
But I'd see her come and go
and say "hi".

03:52.866 --> 03:54.268
That's about it.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.536
(car horn honks)

03:59.072 --> 04:00.508
Hey, McGee.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.975
This is definitely the spot.

04:02.009 --> 04:02.976
Come here, take a look.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.046
You know what?
That's all right; I believe you.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.416
BISHOP:
Well, it doesn't look
like anyone could have seen

04:08.449 --> 04:09.850
from any
of the surrounding buildings.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.755
Is this camera operable?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.424
Yeah, it is.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.025
And there's others
in the building.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.460
I installed them.

04:24.965 --> 04:28.502
(electronic monitors beeping)

04:28.536 --> 04:32.039
DOCTOR:
There are multiple fractures;
intracranial hemorrhage,

04:32.072 --> 04:34.375
cerebral damage.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.410
Injuries to the liver,
spleen, lungs.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.712
What's the prognosis?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.414
Well, there's
always a possibility

04:40.448 --> 04:41.715
she could regain
consciousness,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.417
but I doubt it.
If she does,

04:43.451 --> 04:45.519
there'd be serious,
irreversible damage.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.388
Okay. You'll let us know
if there's a change.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.889
Certainly.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.324
Thanks.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.961
The sister's a wreck.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.729
There's no point
in asking questions now.
Yeah.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.097
We'll come back.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.766
(elevator dings)

05:00.401 --> 05:02.102
Hello, Doc.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.037
You're here because
of Sergeant Hill.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.473
She's my patient.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.342
Hi. Special Agent Alex Quinn.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.043
Oh. New member of Team Gibbs.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.879
Grace Confalone.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.447
How long have you been treating
Sergeant Hill?

05:13.481 --> 05:14.715
For the last month.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.983
Was she sick?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.084
GIBBS:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.086
This doctor is a psychiatrist.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.822
Was she, uh, depressed?

05:21.855 --> 05:24.392
Give me a break, Popeye.
I'd love to help you,

05:24.425 --> 05:25.826
but you know I can't
give you any information

05:25.859 --> 05:28.028
without my patient's permission.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.963
Uh, how do you two
know each other?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.632
GRACE:
We worked on
a case together.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.100
Very tough patient.
Doc.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.403
Can you give us something?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.105
I really shouldn't
tell you this,

05:38.138 --> 05:42.410
but you should investigate this
as an attempted murder.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.091
McGEE:
Sergeant Erin Kendall Hill
was born and raised

05:58.125 --> 05:59.059
in Falls Church, Virginia.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.462
Both her parents were killed
in a car accident

06:01.495 --> 06:03.130
when she was nine years old.

06:03.163 --> 06:06.133
She went to live with her older
sister, Devon, here in D.C.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.435
And she joined the Marines
right out of high school.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.770
She was in boot camp
at Parris Island.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.539
School of Infantry
at Camp Geiger.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.008
Female Engagement Team Training
during two tours in Afghanistan.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.677
Purple Heart.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.147
Bronze star with a combat "V".

06:20.180 --> 06:22.115
For "disregarding her own
safety, Sergeant Hill shielded

06:22.149 --> 06:24.552
"the casualties with her own
body as large chunks of shrapnel

06:24.585 --> 06:28.021
began flying through the air
from the burning vehicle."

06:28.055 --> 06:30.524
Seems like a perfect candidate
for Post Traumatic Stress.

06:30.558 --> 06:34.194
She's new, Gibbs,
but you have her well-trained.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.463
What's next?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.630
You gonna take me downstairs

06:36.664 --> 06:37.665
to your torture room and try

06:37.698 --> 06:38.966
to squeeze something out of me?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.668
Sure. What's your
preference, Doc?

06:40.701 --> 06:42.035
A little waterboard?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.203
A little bamboo
under the fingernail?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.138
Come on, Doc.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.607
You're the one who
dangled the carrot.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.211
Erin is my patient,
obviously she has issues.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.980
If I was looking into
what happened,

06:53.013 --> 06:55.015
suicide wouldn't be
the first road I'd go down.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.150
That's all
I'm telling you.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.453
Nice to meet you, Alex.

07:00.988 --> 07:01.955
Agent McGee.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.124
Get started.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.059
Well, Sergeant Hill was
presently stationed at Quantico.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.995
Quinn and I are going to go talk
to her company commander.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.030
Go.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.133
(distant jackhammering)

07:15.235 --> 07:16.970
TORRES:
You know, if two brothers
lived in this apartment,

07:17.004 --> 07:18.939
this place would be
a pigsty.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.608
I hear ya.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.109
I've got three brothers.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.745
I haven't found a note.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.246
It's not looking like a suicide.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.917
You know, this isn't
a bad neighborhood, huh?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.119
I mean, it's pretty close
to the Naval Yard, too.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.788
How much do you think
an apartment in this area
would cost?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.156
I don't know.
I'll give you the name

07:36.189 --> 07:37.625
of my real estate agent.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.960
Why'd you move?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.764
Got divorced.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.233
Maybe you can, uh, fill me in

07:46.266 --> 07:48.802
on this whole District
dating scene.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.804
Not really.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.105
It's not my thing.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.975
Hey, Bishop.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.178
Are these, uh,
Marine-issued underwear?

07:58.211 --> 08:02.049
Okay. Let's respect
Sergeant Hill's privacy.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.150
I will take the bedroom.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.553
Works for me.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.287
Find anything else,
other than these?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.522
Yeah.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.090
She likes watches.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.630
So... you ever been married?

08:17.931 --> 08:19.199
Not really.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.634
What's that mean?

08:26.607 --> 08:27.875
Hey.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.209
Found her phone.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.244
(phone beeping)

08:32.746 --> 08:34.281
Yeah, she missed a call

08:34.314 --> 08:36.216
at 7:42 a.m.
this morning.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.552
Just minutes
before she fell.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.121
It's an international
country code of 93...

08:41.154 --> 08:43.791
It's Afghanistan.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.826
(knocking at door)

08:52.132 --> 08:53.901
Uh, here you go.
Downloaded the building's

08:53.934 --> 08:55.869
security recordings
from the past 24 hours.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.838
Thanks, man. Hey.
No problem.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.707
Listen, there's
an apartment for rent

08:59.740 --> 09:00.908
available in this building.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.342
Uh...

09:02.375 --> 09:04.311
I'm kind of interested in it.
Oh, yeah.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.813
I'm-I'm just maintenance.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.047
Yeah, you have to talk
to the leasing agent.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.683
Okay, could you
at least show it to me?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.318
Just a couple of minutes,
in and out?

09:11.351 --> 09:13.053
Yeah.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.354
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

09:14.387 --> 09:15.589
Cool.
Come on.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.857
Hey, I'll be back.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.325
Do not solve

09:18.358 --> 09:19.860
this case without me.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.867
I'll be honest-- I'm
not totally surprised.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.201
Why is that?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.236
When Sergeant Hill
first reported in,

09:29.269 --> 09:30.704
I was impressed.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.673
Combat hero,
Bronze Star.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.275
Kind of Marine
everyone's proud of.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.377
But after a week on the job,
she seemed distracted.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.279
Couldn't focus
on her work.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.214
Any idea
what the problem was?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.183
At first, I thought
it was because

09:43.216 --> 09:44.885
her enlistment was
coming to an end

09:44.918 --> 09:46.754
and she was debating
whether to re-up or not.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.222
Now you're thinking
it might be something else?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.625
Yeah, Afghanistan.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.094
I think her last tour
was a traumatic experience.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.129
Well, did you ask her
about it?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.331
Tried, but she wouldn't open up.

09:58.365 --> 10:02.202
She was seeing a psychiatrist
at Walter Reed on my insistence.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.671
Hmm.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.275
(door creaks)
(distant dogs bark)

10:08.308 --> 10:11.945
(fire crackling)

10:21.789 --> 10:23.390
FORNELL:
Get your hand off

10:23.423 --> 10:25.092
that light switch.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.426
You'll ruin the mood.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.162
The mood?
We gonna make out, what?

10:29.196 --> 10:31.164
I'm just trying
to express my appreciation

10:31.198 --> 10:34.167
for your hospitality
and friendship.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.435
If you want
to show your appreciation,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.904
stop wearing my clothes.
Sorry,

10:36.937 --> 10:38.438
I had nothing clean.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.109
I thought you were gonna do
the laundry today.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.311
Oh. Yeah. Well,

10:44.344 --> 10:47.314
the day didn't turn out
exactly like I thought it would.

10:47.347 --> 10:51.018
Come on. Sit down.
I made your favorite,

10:51.051 --> 10:53.821
lasagne verdi
al forno.
That's your favorite.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.323
(hoarsely):
"Sit, Michael, sit."

10:56.356 --> 10:58.425
(clears throat)

10:58.458 --> 11:02.429
I have been cooped up here all
day, alone, no one to talk to.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.231
You tell me how your day went.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.466
Prying conversation

11:06.499 --> 11:09.903
is exactly why two
of my marriages didn't work.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.772
I heard you had a Marine jumper.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.741
Who told you that?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.375
McGee told me. I called
the office to find out

11:15.408 --> 11:17.377
what time you'd be home.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.981
(groans)

11:21.982 --> 11:23.316
It's warm beer.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.418
Um... Hey!

11:27.454 --> 11:30.223
The Germans like it that way.
They know... they know beer.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.295
(sighs)

11:35.328 --> 11:37.430
The hell? The
electricity's off.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.199
I thought I told you.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.367
What happened?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.936
You're gonna love this.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.437
I was doing my laundry

11:44.471 --> 11:46.073
and then the washing machine

11:46.106 --> 11:48.208
made this strange clunking sound

11:48.241 --> 11:49.442
and then stopped.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.211
I wanted to save you
some money.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.080
And I'm pretty handy
with tools.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.515
So I tried to fix it, but...
(chuckles)

11:55.548 --> 11:57.818
...um, somehow,

11:57.851 --> 12:01.822
somehow I-I blew
that whole black box outside.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.857
Where you goin'? Hey!

12:03.891 --> 12:07.494
Uh, the power company promised
they'd be here tomorrow.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.763
Next day, at the latest.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.500
Polly want a cracker?

12:13.533 --> 12:16.169
Not Polly. Not Polly.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.805
(stammers)
What do you mean, not Polly?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.039
(squawks)

12:19.072 --> 12:20.307
(chuckling):
Oh!

12:20.340 --> 12:22.342
His name is Juan.
Juan.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.845
Juan.
(chuckles)

12:24.878 --> 12:26.013
Parrot?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.815
(wolf-whistles)
Yeah. Actually,

12:27.848 --> 12:29.449
a yellow-breasted
Amazon parrot.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.484
He belongs to my brother, Kyle.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.486
He rescued him.
But Kyle's out of town,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.089
so I am birdsitting.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.059
You couldn't
leave him home, Abbs?
I tried that yesterday,

12:39.092 --> 12:40.928
but he made so much noise
all my neighbors complained.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.396
Yeah, but your solution,
Abbs, was to bring him here?

12:43.430 --> 12:46.399
Gibbs, his name is Juan.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.401
(Juan squawks)

12:48.435 --> 12:51.571
Classic. I got to go
get on the autopsy.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.941
Look, Kyle gets
home tonight,

12:53.974 --> 12:57.444
and I promise you will
never see this bird again.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.480
What am I doing here?

13:01.314 --> 13:02.950
Oh. Because,

13:02.983 --> 13:04.952
um, I've been reviewing
the security footage

13:04.985 --> 13:06.954
from the apartment
complex. I've isolated

13:06.987 --> 13:11.091
the cameras that show Sergeant
Hill going to the rooftop.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.560
So, first, she leaves
her apartment at 8:03.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.964
She walks down the hall
and then goes

13:16.997 --> 13:18.331
up the staircase

13:18.365 --> 13:20.433
to the roof.
Then she's on the roof,

13:20.467 --> 13:22.169
walking towards
the wall.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.604
Unfortunately, the place
where she jumped is obscured

13:24.637 --> 13:26.373
by the air-conditioning unit.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.042
But her fall was captured
by a street-level camera

13:29.076 --> 13:32.512
out front
12 seconds later.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.148
She was alone
on top of the roof.
Yeah.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.450
No one entered or exited
that rooftop

13:37.484 --> 13:39.586
for another two
and a half hours,

13:39.619 --> 13:41.588
when McGee, Bishop,
and Torres went up there

13:41.621 --> 13:44.591
with the building
maintenance dude.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.594
My gut said it
wasn't a suicide.

13:47.627 --> 13:51.831
Could your gut
and Dr. Grace be wrong?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.010
Sergeant Hill received
a phone call from Afghanistan

14:03.043 --> 14:04.477
minutes before she fell.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.213
We traced it back to a guy
in Kabul.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.016
Who is he?
Griffin Dorn.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.284
Civilian defense contractor.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.585
(lock trills)

14:16.589 --> 14:18.558
Mr. Dorn.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.194
Special Agents
Gibbs and Torres.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.196
Yeah. What do you want?

14:25.132 --> 14:28.235
Yesterday you made a phone call
to Sergeant Erin Hill.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.004
You want to tell us
what it was about?

14:31.038 --> 14:34.074
Wasn't about anything.
She didn't answer.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.408
Why'd you want
to talk to her?

14:35.442 --> 14:36.910
It was personal.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.012
Why is NCIS asking?

14:39.046 --> 14:42.349
Sergeant Hill had an accident
minutes after your call.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.385
She's in extremely
critical condition.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.988
So what were you
calling her about?

14:48.021 --> 14:51.258
I'm gonna be in DC tomorrow and
I wanted to meet up with her.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.659
Why?

14:52.692 --> 14:56.096
I worked with Erin
in Helmand Province.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.464
I was impressed.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.133
I knew her hitch was almost up,
so I offered her a job.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.335
I wanted to close the deal.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.637
Well, you could've
just said that.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.439
DOD tends to frown

15:06.473 --> 15:10.510
on civilian contractors trying
to poach military personnel.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.147
Listen, gentlemen, I got a plane
to catch. Excuse me.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.016
Squirrelly dude.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.450
You trust him?

15:17.484 --> 15:20.353
Eh, check him out.
Sir.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.190
Get me McGee.
(keys clacking)

15:23.223 --> 15:25.225
(chuckles)
I hate selfies.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.593
Oh, come on, indulge me.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.161
(both laugh)

15:28.195 --> 15:29.229
ERIN:
You happy?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.630
DEVON:
Yes.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.233
I had just started my
sophomore year in college

15:33.266 --> 15:35.135
when our parents
were killed.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.304
I had to drop out and come home
to take care of Erin.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.339
There was really
no one else and I...

15:39.372 --> 15:42.175
didn't want her to become
a ward of the state.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.011
So, you're more than a sister.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.578
When she was
growing up,

15:45.612 --> 15:48.148
I was really like
a mother to her.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.317
Did you know she was thinking
about leaving the Corps?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.019
Yes.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.257
Erin got a very lucrative job
offer from a defense contractor,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.292
and it would be payback time.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.263
She told me it was her turn

16:03.296 --> 16:04.597
to take care of me.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.266
Said she'd pay for me

16:06.299 --> 16:07.300
to go back to school,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.269
get a degree and go

16:09.302 --> 16:10.403
to nursing school.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.205
That was always my dream.

16:16.276 --> 16:19.279
Why is NCIS investigating?

16:19.312 --> 16:22.482
Didn't Erin try...

16:22.515 --> 16:24.651
to take her own life?

16:26.519 --> 16:29.189
All indications are
that she did, yes.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.527
What?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.131
That she'd do it from our roof.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.433
Even as a young girl,
when she had a problem,

16:40.467 --> 16:43.336
Erin would always go up there
to clear her mind.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.673
And where were you yesterday
morning when it occurred?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.408
At work--
I'm a barista

16:48.441 --> 16:50.343
at a coffee bar
at DuPont Circle.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.512
I always open up early.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.048
(loud beeping)

16:55.082 --> 16:57.117
WOMAN (over intercom):
Code blue! Code blue!

16:57.150 --> 16:59.686
Resus Team to ICU3, stat!

16:59.719 --> 17:01.188
Code blue!

17:01.221 --> 17:03.723
Resus Team to ICU3, stat!

17:03.756 --> 17:05.692
(medical staff clamoring)

17:07.460 --> 17:09.262
DUCKY:
I'm sorry, Abby.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.764
There's no way
for me to determine

17:11.798 --> 17:13.500
her mental state
from these images.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.269
I was just hoping
there'd be something

17:16.303 --> 17:19.306
about her body language that
could tell you something.

17:19.339 --> 17:23.410
But why is Gibbs so
doubtful it was a suicide?

17:23.443 --> 17:26.113
Well, Sergeant Hill was
seeing a shrink, who hinted

17:26.146 --> 17:28.381
that there might be
something else,

17:28.415 --> 17:31.151
but ethically couldn't
divulge anything else to him.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.419
Hmm.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.586
He couldn't break her
with his look?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.688
I'm intimidated by Gibbs.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.423
(Juan squawks)

17:36.456 --> 17:38.391
Gibbs, Gibbs.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.427
Ah, you do talk!

17:40.460 --> 17:43.230
Yep, and a little bit
too much sometimes, huh?

17:43.263 --> 17:46.466
Winston Churchill had a parrot
named Charlie the Curser.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.535
He often went on

17:48.568 --> 17:51.671
anti-Nazi tirades,
mimicking Churchill's voice

17:51.704 --> 17:54.807
and using his favorite
profanities against Hitler.

17:54.841 --> 17:58.311
The parrot outlived Churchill
and ended up residing

17:58.345 --> 18:00.247
at a zoo called Hansfield.
(phone chimes)

18:00.280 --> 18:01.381
That's where I saw him.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.216
Or, rather, her.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.652
Charlie was a female.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.454
Oh, it's my brother.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.689
He missed his plane
and he's stranded.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.392
I have Juan another day.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.361
And Gibbs is gonna kill me.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.496
Don't tell Gibbs.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.465
Don't tell Gibbs.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.632
Don't tell Gibbs.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.268
(laughing)

18:22.669 --> 18:25.505
(squawking)

18:26.906 --> 18:28.508
Quinn, what you find out?

18:28.541 --> 18:31.711
Well, Sergeant Hill
was very well-liked.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.915
I spoke to several Marines who
served with her in Afghanistan.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.518
She didn't have any enemies.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.486
They know she was
thinking of going to work

18:39.519 --> 18:40.520
for a defense contractor?

18:40.553 --> 18:41.654
No, and I asked.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.256
While we were
at the hospital,

18:43.290 --> 18:44.524
Sergeant Hill
went into cardiac arrest.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.726
Eh, they were able
to resuscitate her.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.495
How's her sister holding up?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.496
Not well.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.298
Oh, God, if anything happened

18:51.331 --> 18:53.366
to my sister,
I don't know what I would do.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.435
I'll give the doctor a call.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.803
Thank you.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.306
Just got off the phone
with the leasing agent

18:59.339 --> 19:01.841
from the apartment
at Sergeant Hill's building.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.311
Oh, yeah?

19:04.344 --> 19:05.745
You interested?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.447
Eh, I'm not sure.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.448
Why?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.417
The agent disclosed that,

19:10.450 --> 19:12.919
uh, the previous tenant
was a 92-year-old man,

19:12.952 --> 19:17.324
who, who died
in the apartment and-and...

19:18.558 --> 19:20.460
It's a little, um,
just creepy.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.494
BISHOP:
Really?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.363
It bothers you?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.699
Uh... yeah, a little.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.535
I, I got, I got
to think about it.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.808
(distant dog barking)

19:39.279 --> 19:40.447
Gibbs?

19:40.480 --> 19:41.781
Mm-hmm.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.216
Thought you were
in the basement.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.517
I was.
Now I'm here.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.653
You losing
your hearing, too?

19:46.686 --> 19:47.954
What are you doing, Tobias?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.422
I hid this file.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.657
Not very well.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.328
I'm bored.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.430
It's a classified
government file.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.399
I'm a classified government guy.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.633
Come on!

20:00.667 --> 20:01.868
Throw me a bone.
Anything, will you?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.436
Let me help you.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.437
Can't watch another
cooking show.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.438
Go back to the Bureau.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.873
They won't sign off

20:06.906 --> 20:08.875
on my fitness
for duty evaluation.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.843
(door opens)

20:10.877 --> 20:11.844
(closes)

20:11.878 --> 20:14.247
Gibbs?
Uh-huh?

20:14.281 --> 20:15.548
Didn't know you
made house calls.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.716
I don't.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.218
Mind if I get a beer?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.524
You okay?

20:24.557 --> 20:27.594
Erin Hill passed away.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.296
(fridge door shuts)

20:30.930 --> 20:32.599
(sighs)

20:32.632 --> 20:34.567
Sorry about that, Doc.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.506
Confidentiality
ends with death.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.541
So...

20:41.574 --> 20:43.310
what I couldn't
tell you before was

20:43.343 --> 20:46.479
Sergeant Hill was involved
in the cover-up of a murder.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.458
Sergeant Hill was ordered

20:58.491 --> 21:00.026
by her commanding officer
to have therapy.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.694
She was seeing me
under duress.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.830
First couple of sessions,
she barely said a word,

21:03.863 --> 21:05.765
but it was obvious
that she was troubled.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.368
You said she was involved
in the cover-up of a murder.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.670
This something
that happened in Afghanistan?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.038
She wouldn't give me details.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.340
She didn't want
to implicate anyone.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.475
Grace, you're good.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.043
(laughing): You are.
You're really good.

21:17.076 --> 21:20.012
You had to have some
kind of hint, right?

21:20.046 --> 21:22.515
This about the murder
of some Afghan civilian

21:22.549 --> 21:23.716
by one of our troops?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.418
It's about a fragging?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.986
Grace, what?
I don't know.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.021
FORNELL:
Gibbs, what about

21:29.055 --> 21:31.524
the defense contractor that
offered Sergeant Hill a job?

21:31.558 --> 21:33.059
Maybe it was hush money

21:33.092 --> 21:34.627
for something
that she saw over there.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.464
Is J. Edgar consulting
on your case?

21:37.497 --> 21:39.632
What exactly
did Sergeant Hill tell you?

21:39.666 --> 21:42.902
Not much.
She was stressed and conflicted.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.438
It took me several sessions
to convince her

21:45.472 --> 21:47.740
that I was bound
by strict confidentiality.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.443
Well, was she involved in the
cover-up, or the murder, too?

21:50.477 --> 21:52.379
She was just beginning
to open up.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.781
A few more sessions,
and I might have found out.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.550
You don't think
she was suicidal?

21:57.584 --> 22:00.453
Oh, no. I would have seen that.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.758
(birds singing)

22:08.495 --> 22:09.962
Good morning, Dr. Mallard.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.565
Alex. What a pleasant surprise.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.601
What brings you down here?

22:14.634 --> 22:17.003
Oh, uh, heard
Sergeant Hill died.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.105
I was wondering if
her body arrived yet.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.740
Now, Mr. Palmer's gone
to fetch her,

22:20.773 --> 22:23.009
but he hasn't returned yet.
Why do you ask?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.977
Well, I used to
teach my students

22:25.011 --> 22:27.847
at FLETC that it helps
the investigation

22:27.880 --> 22:30.149
to relate to the victim.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.151
Ooh. Excellent advice.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.687
Well, yesterday, when I was at
the hospital with Sergeant Hill,

22:34.721 --> 22:37.390
you know, she was obscured with
all this life-support equipment,

22:37.424 --> 22:39.592
and I-I really couldn't make
a connection.

22:39.626 --> 22:43.430
This is gonna sound strange,
but I hoped to come down here

22:43.463 --> 22:46.499
and just spend
a few moments with her.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.668
Well, that doesn't sound strange
at all.

22:48.701 --> 22:53.039
Truth be told, I've been known
to talk to my patients.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.674
Really?
Mm.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.609
It helps me get to know them.

22:56.643 --> 23:00.046
I'm sure all the agents upstairs
think I'm bonkers.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.448
(laughs)

23:01.481 --> 23:03.616
Well, your methods
get results, so...

23:03.650 --> 23:06.118
(chuckles)
You must come down here
more often.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.587
(door whooshes open)

23:07.620 --> 23:10.623
I am sorry
it took so long.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.959
There was a wreck
out there on the Rockville Pike.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.027
Oh, hey!

23:15.061 --> 23:17.597
Good morning.
Hi, Jimmy.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.433
So, I will just scrub up
and get the body ready.

23:20.467 --> 23:23.936
Relax, Mr. Palmer.
You've had a hectic morning.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.805
No, as a matter of fact,
I was thinking

23:25.838 --> 23:29.008
of going upstairs myself
for a cup of tea.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.980
Why don't you join me?

23:34.013 --> 23:35.648
Shall we?

23:35.682 --> 23:37.817
Uh... yeah.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.652
I guess.

23:39.686 --> 23:40.887
(laughs)

23:44.256 --> 23:46.225
(doors whoosh open)

23:46.258 --> 23:48.661
(elevator bell dings)

23:48.695 --> 23:51.063
(doors whoosh shut)

23:59.038 --> 24:01.107
Hi, Sergeant Hill.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.879
I have a sister
around your age.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.551
McGEE:
I've rewatched

24:11.584 --> 24:12.885
the video-- Sergeant
Hill is definitely

24:12.919 --> 24:14.554
the only one
on the roof.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.589
Dr. Grace still think
it wasn't a suicide?

24:16.623 --> 24:18.591
Grace said that
Hill was conflicted

24:18.625 --> 24:20.693
because she knew something
about a murderous cover-up.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.595
Well, maybe that's why
she took her own life.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.696
Wait, if there was
a murder, where was it--

24:23.730 --> 24:24.931
Afghanistan or here?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.232
Could be either.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.067
Well, she's only been
in D.C. a month.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.069
Wait, there was...

24:30.102 --> 24:31.938
there was a death

24:31.971 --> 24:34.206
in Sergeant Hill's
building recently.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.675
Well, how do you know that?

24:35.708 --> 24:38.511
Well, there was
an apartment available.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.746
I called the rental agent.
He had to disclose

24:39.779 --> 24:41.681
there was a death
in the apartment.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.683
This 92-year-old man

24:43.716 --> 24:44.984
suffering from dementia.
Now, it's worth,

24:45.017 --> 24:46.285
it's worth a shot.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.654
(Bishop sighs)

24:47.687 --> 24:48.855
Found him in the lobby.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.957
Agent Fornell, how you feeling?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.925
Better every day, Tim.
Thank you.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.026
That's a nice jacket.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.562
(chuckles)

24:55.595 --> 24:57.296
It's mine.
What are you doing here?

24:57.329 --> 24:59.265
FORNELL:
Following up on a lead.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.300
Griffin Dorn,
the contractor in Afghanistan.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.735
Guy at the Bureau,

25:02.769 --> 25:04.671
who owes me one,
vetted him last year.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.039
He says he's legit,

25:07.073 --> 25:10.142
but his former employer
was the CIA.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.112
Is it possible
to be former CIA?

25:13.145 --> 25:14.681
GIBBS:
Thank you.

25:14.714 --> 25:15.948
Go home.
He flew out

25:15.982 --> 25:17.684
of Kabul yesterday
to Ramstein in Germany.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.752
He hopped on a military
transport there,

25:19.786 --> 25:20.987
and he lands
at Andrews at noon!

25:21.020 --> 25:22.722
We can go
and pull him in!

25:22.755 --> 25:25.692
You got a desk that I can use
until, uh, until then?

25:25.725 --> 25:28.695
McGee, escort Agent Fornell
out of the building.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.664
If he resists,
feel free to use your weapon.

25:31.698 --> 25:32.699
Oh, come on.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.866
Jethro!

25:39.606 --> 25:40.973
MAN:
I was the first responder

25:41.007 --> 25:42.241
to the scene.
The building's just

25:42.274 --> 25:43.810
a couple blocks from here.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.745
The old guy was dead
when I got there.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.780
Do you remember
who placed the 911 call?

25:47.814 --> 25:49.148
Yeah, a neighbor
in the building.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.983
Let me pull up
my report.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.152
Hey, you been working
this neighborhood long?

25:53.185 --> 25:54.754
Almost a year.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.788
I'm looking for an apartment.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.056
It seems nice.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.658
(chuckles)
If you can afford it.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.326
Ah, here it is.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.061
The old man's name
was Leonard Odetts.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.663
The caller was a Devon Hill.

26:03.696 --> 26:04.831
Erin Hill's sister.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.265
Mm.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.700
We're investigating
the death of a woman

26:07.734 --> 26:08.768
who lived in
that building.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.236
The one who jumped?

26:10.269 --> 26:11.671
Yeah.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.239
I was off-duty,
but I heard about it.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.707
Made me think the building
was cursed or something.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.778
What did Devon Hill say?

26:18.811 --> 26:20.647
Told us the old guy
lived alone.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.015
And she checked on him almost
every day before going to work.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.784
And when he didn't
respond that morning,

26:24.817 --> 26:26.653
she had the building
maintenance men let her in.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.688
Gregg Abell?
Yeah.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.723
They found Odetts on the floor
in a pool of blood.

26:30.757 --> 26:31.958
His walker was nearby.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.259
It looked like
he lost his balance,

26:33.292 --> 26:34.293
hit his head on the sharp edge

26:34.326 --> 26:35.361
of a metal table and bled out.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.696
Didn't seem like foul play?

26:36.729 --> 26:37.897
Not to me.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.799
Or the coroner when he arrived.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.001
The estimated time of death?

26:42.034 --> 26:44.036
Yeah, several hours
the night before.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.875
So many fractures,
so much damage.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.343
I'm sure the only reason
Sergeant Hill survived as long

26:51.377 --> 26:54.246
as she did is 'cause she's in
such good physical shape.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.216
You know, when I was
digitizing the old NIS files,

26:57.249 --> 27:00.019
I came across a case where
a Marine drill instructor

27:00.052 --> 27:02.889
fell six stories
and survived.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.256
He...

27:04.290 --> 27:06.225
Are you ready?

27:06.258 --> 27:08.394
Ah, Jethro.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.898
Aren't you gonna ask me,
"What you got, Duck?"

27:11.931 --> 27:14.233
Nope, you haven't even
opened her up yet.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.035
Duck, you still

27:16.068 --> 27:17.737
on good terms
with your M.E. friend?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.238
Tom Hubbard?
Yeah.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.907
We split a bottle
of Châteauneuf

27:20.940 --> 27:23.743
only last night
over a game of gin rummy.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.077
Call him.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.413
Find out about Leonard Odetts.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.849
Died five weeks ago,
apparently from a fall.
(phone ringing)

27:29.882 --> 27:30.717
See if they did an autopsy.

27:30.750 --> 27:31.951
Yeah, Abbs, what?

27:31.984 --> 27:33.085
Come to the lab.
Can you come to the lab?

27:33.119 --> 27:34.086
I got something...

27:34.120 --> 27:35.688
Abby, slow down.

27:35.722 --> 27:36.756
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

27:36.789 --> 27:37.824
I'm on my way.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.058
Why don't you start

27:39.091 --> 27:40.860
the incision, Mr. Palmer,

27:40.893 --> 27:43.095
while I make the call.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.335
What took you so long?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.003
Slow elevator.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.840
You should take the stairs.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.742
I'm glad your
bird is gone.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.977
Well, I'm glad
that you're glad.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.478
What's got you
so excited?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.881
You're not gonna believe
what I found, Gibbs.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.382
JUAN:
Don't tell Gibbs.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.718
Don't tell Gibbs!

28:05.752 --> 28:07.253
What was that?
What was what?

28:07.286 --> 28:08.788
(Juan squawking)

28:08.821 --> 28:09.822
Gibbs, where are you going?

28:09.856 --> 28:12.191
I have to show you
something.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.060
(Juan chitters)

28:15.895 --> 28:17.063
(squawks)

28:17.096 --> 28:19.932
Don't tell Gibbs!
Uh-oh.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.433
Now, that sounds like Palmer.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.103
Look, Kyle's flight got

28:24.136 --> 28:26.172
canceled and then
a weather front moved in

28:26.205 --> 28:27.874
and he's stuck
in Chattanooga.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.809
But he said that
if he can't get off tonight,

28:29.842 --> 28:31.944
he's gonna rent a car
and he's gonna drive up.
(squawks)

28:31.978 --> 28:34.213
I know, Juan.
I just... not now.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.415
You know, he's really smart.

28:36.448 --> 28:37.784
And-and he watches me
all the time.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.185
Uh, I feel like
he knows something

28:39.218 --> 28:40.452
and he's trying
to communicate.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.789
Abby, just tell me
what you found.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.823
Okay.

28:43.856 --> 28:44.957
Take a look at this.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.458
What am I looking at?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.328
See the difference?

28:49.361 --> 28:50.496
Tell me.

28:50.529 --> 28:51.898
The wristwatches.

28:51.931 --> 28:52.631
When Sergeant Hill

28:52.664 --> 28:54.266
was on the roof,
she was wearing

28:54.300 --> 28:56.268
one with a leather band.
This...

28:56.302 --> 28:57.870
is what she was wearing
when she hit the sidewalk.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.839
It's metallic.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.874
I mean, what did she do?

29:01.908 --> 29:03.843
Change watches mid-fall?

29:03.876 --> 29:05.477
The videos are
from different days.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.314
ABBY:
Yeah, she wears an identical
uniform every day,

29:08.347 --> 29:09.982
but she changes her watch.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.283
Now we know

29:11.317 --> 29:14.186
that this is the exact time
when she fell.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.455
And I would bet my reputation
that all the other

29:16.488 --> 29:18.390
time and date stamps
have been altered.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.059
These were taken
on another day.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.928
Who did we get this video from?

29:21.961 --> 29:24.196
Building maintenance dude.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.268
Take the stairs!

29:38.310 --> 29:41.447
Gregg Abell, 36,
born and raised in Dover.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.249
Graduated with a degree
in computer science

29:43.282 --> 29:45.117
from Delaware Tech.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.887
Why is he in building
maintenance?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.155
Uh, Alex?

29:49.188 --> 29:50.823
Well, probably
because he was convicted

29:50.857 --> 29:53.525
of computer hacking
and Internet fraud in 2012.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.128
He also spent
a year in Sussex

29:56.162 --> 29:59.265
Correctional Institution
and is still on probation.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.400
Certainly sounds
like a guy who could

30:01.433 --> 30:03.836
and would
alter security video.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.104
(line rings)
Boss?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.538
Yeah, McGee. What do you got?

30:06.572 --> 30:08.340
We checked out
Abell's apartment

30:08.374 --> 30:09.942
and the rest of the building--
he's not here.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.044
Attendants say
that's pretty unusual.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.113
I think he's on the run.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.481
We'll put out a BOLO from here.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.949
You two stay there.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.050
You watch for him.

30:18.084 --> 30:20.987
Stakeout time.
I love it.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.022
Grace said that Hill was

30:23.055 --> 30:25.457
"reluctant to go to the police

30:25.491 --> 30:27.259
"because...

30:27.293 --> 30:29.996
she did not want
to implicate others."

30:30.029 --> 30:32.498
Covering for her sister?

30:32.531 --> 30:34.000
They were really close.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.935
Devon raised her
from the age of nine.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.636
But it's hard to believe
that she would have

30:37.669 --> 30:39.471
anything to do
with her sister's death.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.607
Bring her in.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.344
(elevator dings)

30:45.377 --> 30:48.014
(doors whoosh)

30:48.047 --> 30:50.149
Who the hell is that?

30:50.182 --> 30:52.251
Leonard Odetts.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.220
You asked if there
was an autopsy report.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.654
There wasn't.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.057
So I did one better.
I obtained the body.

30:58.090 --> 31:01.060
He's been dead five weeks
and Metro M.E. still had him?

31:01.093 --> 31:02.561
Well, standard procedure.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.030
They hold the body
while they search

31:04.063 --> 31:05.064
for the next of kin.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.565
They haven't found anyone yet.

31:06.598 --> 31:09.035
Yeah, but look at
this-- this gash.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.570
It's inconsistent
with the Metro police report.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.039
It says

31:13.072 --> 31:14.673
the elderly victim

31:14.706 --> 31:16.675
took a fall, hit his head
on a metal table

31:16.708 --> 31:18.044
and bled out.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.512
Yeah. What do you say?
I say, well,

31:20.546 --> 31:22.614
he was hit hard
with a glass object.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.184
I'm taking fragments
out of the wound.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.518
Mr. Palmer,

31:26.552 --> 31:29.956
tell Agent Gibbs what Abby found

31:29.989 --> 31:31.257
in Sergeant Hill's
blood.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.625
Yeah, it was Flunitrazepam.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.062
Known on the streets
as a "roofie."

31:36.095 --> 31:38.998
I checked the list of drugs that
she was given at the hospital.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.033
She didn't get it there.

31:41.067 --> 31:44.103
Hill was drugged before
she was pushed off the roof.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.606
(speaking inaudibly)

31:47.639 --> 31:51.143
Come on. Are you kidding,
Torres? Come on,

31:51.177 --> 31:52.644
I'm starving--
I haven't eaten all day.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.513
Thanks.
Yeah.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.082
(groans)

31:56.115 --> 31:58.084
Yes, yes.
Thank you.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.619
Come on!

32:00.652 --> 32:02.288
Hey.
Hey.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.590
My burger's getting cold,
you're hitting on yoga lady.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.060
Is that what you think
I was doing?

32:08.094 --> 32:11.530
I saw her give
you her number.
I was on the clock, working.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.035
She gave me the name
of the tenant in the building

32:16.068 --> 32:18.037
who's going to give us
the lowdown

32:18.070 --> 32:19.471
on Abell...

32:19.505 --> 32:21.073
and...

32:21.107 --> 32:23.075
Devon Hill.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.743
Oh, yeah.

32:24.776 --> 32:28.514
It turns out
they've been doing the nasty.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.121
An apology now
would be nice.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.622
I'm sorry.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.290
It's okay.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.559
Here, enjoy
your lukewarm burger.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.494
(laughs softly)
Thanks.

32:44.696 --> 32:48.400
You know what, this is...
it's actually not cold. Fine.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.003
Hey, uh, McGee,
for the record...

32:51.037 --> 32:54.040
the yoga lady's name is Shanna,

32:54.073 --> 32:57.076
and she did give me her number.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.679
Very nice.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.248
Thanks.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.083
Oh-ho. Food's
gonna have to wait.

33:04.116 --> 33:06.518
Postman. All-knowing.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.087
You can learn a lot
about people

33:08.120 --> 33:11.023
from what they get
in their mail.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.725
QUINN:
The post office held
Odetts' mail for five weeks?

33:13.759 --> 33:14.793
Yeah. The mailman
explained that,

33:14.826 --> 33:16.362
you know,
it was pretty routine.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.230
That they knew the
old man had died,

33:18.264 --> 33:20.366
uh, but the post
office was holding it

33:20.399 --> 33:23.602
until the next of
kin or executor of
the estate claimed it.

33:23.635 --> 33:27.106
Huh. Not much mail, huh?
No. He was old, so...

33:27.139 --> 33:29.141
uh, Social Security
check, you know,

33:29.175 --> 33:31.277
a few utility bills,
advertisements.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.645
No credit cards
or bank statements?

33:33.679 --> 33:36.648
Life gets simple
when you're 92.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.317
Only thing of interest
was this letter.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.351
Thanks.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.153
It's from a...

33:41.187 --> 33:43.155
precious metal
and rare coin dealer.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.257
He wrote Odetts
asking if he

33:45.291 --> 33:48.127
was interested in selling some
or all of his collection.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.162
McGee's on the phone with
the dealer right now.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.131
So, do we think
the collection may be still

33:52.164 --> 33:54.100
in the old man's apartment?
Well, I doubt it.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.102
I mean, when they showed me
the place, it looked like

33:56.135 --> 33:58.337
nobody had lived in it--
completely bare, new painting...

33:58.370 --> 34:00.672
(squawking)
Oh! Watch out!

34:02.108 --> 34:03.242
(squawks)

34:05.244 --> 34:08.847
Wow. Juan flew over
the cuckoo's nest.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.350
All right, I think I got
a motive for the murder.

34:11.383 --> 34:14.186
Odetts was a child
of the Great Depression.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.854
He didn't trust banks.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.157
I've heard of people hiding
their fortune in their homes.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.692
Well, according
to the coin dealer,

34:20.726 --> 34:22.494
Odetts had been buying
gold bullion

34:22.528 --> 34:24.396
and rare coins for years.

34:24.430 --> 34:26.532
Did he say how much
the collection was worth?

34:26.565 --> 34:27.833
Over seven figures.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.236
We should know more
by morning.

34:30.269 --> 34:32.371
Why? What's happening then?
Well, he's got
an appointment

34:32.404 --> 34:33.872
at 9:00 a.m. with a man

34:33.905 --> 34:36.642
who claims
to represent Odetts' estate.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.444
He wants to liquidate
the collection

34:38.477 --> 34:40.246
and needs an appraisal.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.116
Could that man be...
Gregg Abell?

34:44.150 --> 34:45.884
Not the name he used.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.286
Hey. Have you guys seen the...

34:50.922 --> 34:55.427
I was led to believe you thought
my sister took her own life.

34:55.461 --> 34:57.896
Oh, we're pretty sure
it's a homicide.

34:57.929 --> 35:02.134
We found strong sedatives
in her system.

35:02.168 --> 35:05.171
She'd been drugged,
and we believe that she
was pushed off the roof.

35:06.805 --> 35:10.742
(voice trembling):
No. That can't be right.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.445
I should be in there--
if she knew what her sister

35:13.479 --> 35:15.747
revealed to me in therapy,
I think she'd talk.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.584
No. Rule number 17--
never, ever interrupt Gibbs

35:18.617 --> 35:20.286
during an interrogation.

35:20.319 --> 35:21.653
DEVON:
I thought there were

35:21.687 --> 35:24.590
security cameras showing
my sister alone on the roof.

35:24.623 --> 35:29.928
GIBBS: Well, that was altered
by the building maintenance man.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.399
Guy named... Gregg Abell.

35:42.274 --> 35:46.178
We know that you were having
a relationship with him.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.248
We also think
that Abell

35:49.281 --> 35:51.683
was involved in the murder
of an elderly man

35:51.717 --> 35:53.752
in your building--

35:53.785 --> 35:55.787
Leonard Odetts.

35:55.821 --> 35:59.625
We know that you looked
in on him every day.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.628
Your sister confessed
to a therapist

36:02.661 --> 36:05.331
that she knew about a murder
that was covered up.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.366
Okay, that's it!
He's talking about me.

36:07.399 --> 36:08.800
I should be in there.
I'm gonna text Gibbs.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.836
Um, put that away.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.314
You'd best tell me
what you know.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.782
(knock at door)

36:23.815 --> 36:26.818
Boss, something I really
need to tell you.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.823
What the hell happened
to rule 17?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.360
I... don't know,
but it must be important

36:34.393 --> 36:36.595
or McGee wouldn't risk his life.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.332
(door opens)

36:40.366 --> 36:42.568
Hey. What was so important?

36:42.601 --> 36:43.802
Listen.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.337
GIBBS:
Okay...

36:45.371 --> 36:48.206
last chance, Devon.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.748
I want to know
about the gold.

36:56.782 --> 37:00.218
I want to know about
the missing coins.

37:03.389 --> 37:04.823
The gold?

37:04.856 --> 37:06.858
Lots of it.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.027
Mr. Odetts was a sweet old man.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.398
Never married.
All his friends were dead.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.501
Years ago, he told me
how he didn't trust banks.

37:15.534 --> 37:18.236
He showed me his coins.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.707
My mistake was telling Gregg.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.710
Wait, you-you
killed him for that?
No.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.378
Gregg convinced me

37:26.412 --> 37:28.747
that Mr. Odetts
was going to die soon,

37:28.780 --> 37:30.549
with no heirs.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.984
The money would go
to the government...

37:33.018 --> 37:34.986
and with him suffering
from dementia,

37:35.020 --> 37:37.956
he wouldn't even know...

37:37.989 --> 37:40.459
if they were missing.

37:40.492 --> 37:43.462
So we started taking it,
a little at a time.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.631
Well, Odetts
figured it out.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.699
He caught Gregg.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.868
Threatened to call the cops.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.003
Gregg panicked.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.840
He picked up a vase...
And you made it look

37:54.873 --> 37:56.442
like he fell.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.477
You lied to the police,

37:58.510 --> 38:00.846
and Gregg made
you believe that

38:00.879 --> 38:03.949
you were guilty of the theft
and in too deep!

38:03.982 --> 38:06.518
You have to believe me.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.388
I loved my sister.
(sniffles)

38:09.421 --> 38:11.790
I have nothing to do
with her death.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.360
And Gregg swore
he didn't, either.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.402
BISHOP:
So, I asked Torres if he'd ever

38:23.435 --> 38:26.672
been married before,
and he gave this, like, strange,

38:26.705 --> 38:28.474
vague answer.
Mm.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.442
I don't think
he has been.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.379
Nothing in his file, anyway.
You checked his file?

38:33.412 --> 38:35.947
Well, maybe it was when
he was undercover.
Mm.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.583
(knocking)
MAN: Hey, man.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.485
Wash your windows.
Two bucks.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.354
Uh, no, thanks. We're good.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.794
There's Abell.
All right,
we've got Abell approaching

38:48.827 --> 38:50.462
from Trent Street.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.630
Roger that.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.667
Let him enter
before we take him down.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.537
It's showtime.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.444
Excuse me, sir,
you're in the way!

39:05.477 --> 39:06.578
(doorbell buzzes)

39:10.649 --> 39:12.484
Hey, it's only two
bucks! Come on!

39:12.518 --> 39:13.785
Please get
out of the way!

39:15.487 --> 39:16.988
Whoa! You guys
are cops!

39:20.659 --> 39:21.860
(horn honks)
Hey!

39:24.863 --> 39:26.398
(horns honking)

39:31.503 --> 39:33.672
(horn honking, tires screech)

39:36.675 --> 39:38.410
Okay. Okay.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.614
You like throwing Marines
off rooftops?

39:42.648 --> 39:43.649
Huh?

39:50.556 --> 39:51.657
(distant dog barking)

39:51.690 --> 39:53.525
FORNELL:
Damn.

39:53.559 --> 39:56.695
Thought for sure
it was the defense contractor.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.464
The building super?

39:58.497 --> 40:00.999
He was afraid Sergeant Hill
would convince her sister

40:01.032 --> 40:02.568
to go to the police.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.102
So he killed her.

40:06.705 --> 40:09.140
So, how are you doing, Tobias?

40:09.174 --> 40:10.976
Great. Leg's coming along.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.578
A few aches and pains.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.846
I still find it hard
to get up off the couch

40:14.880 --> 40:16.081
in the morning.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.216
I go to rehab;
most of 'em.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.219
No, I mean, you know,
how are you feeling?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.121
(laughs quietly)

40:24.623 --> 40:25.557
You're shrinking me.

40:25.591 --> 40:26.592
(laughs)

40:26.625 --> 40:27.893
Is the meter running?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.227
No. I'm just asking you,

40:29.260 --> 40:30.696
as a friend.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.565
I'm doing just fine.

40:33.599 --> 40:37.769
Can I give you
a bit of professional advice?

40:37.803 --> 40:39.771
I don't think
it's so healthy

40:39.805 --> 40:41.773
for you to be
living and sleeping

40:41.807 --> 40:45.243
three feet away from where
you were shot and almost killed.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.478
(door opens)

40:46.512 --> 40:47.779
(door closes)

40:51.049 --> 40:52.651
Oh.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.719
I get it.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.122
You put her up to this.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.091
What?

41:00.125 --> 41:02.961
You want me to leave,
to move out, but...

41:02.994 --> 41:04.930
you can't tell
me yourself,

41:04.963 --> 41:07.699
so you've got your couch doc
doing your dirty work for you.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.670
I'll be in the basement.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.806
If you want
to join me, Doc.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.808
Basement? Interesting.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.510
What's down there?

41:18.544 --> 41:20.979
Sawdust, bottle of bourbon.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.714
Ooh, that sounds good.

41:22.748 --> 41:24.550
Hey.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.118
You know I can't get

41:27.152 --> 41:28.854
down those steps by myself!

41:30.255 --> 41:31.757
Yet.
