[theme music]

00:05.099 --> 00:08.150
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.169 --> 00:12.109
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.029
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.050 --> 00:17.010
They were good.

00:17.030 --> 00:19.160
[theme music]

00:22.149 --> 00:26.149
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.000
He was bad.

00:28.019 --> 00:30.070
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.160 --> 00:34.039
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.060 --> 00:36.159
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.179 --> 00:38.159
[evil laughter]

00:38.179 --> 00:39.189
Unh!

00:39.210 --> 00:41.149
Oh, I'll get you!

00:41.170 --> 00:44.159
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.

00:44.179 --> 00:47.049
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.070 --> 00:51.079
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.100 --> 00:55.149
And if you are good
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.170 --> 00:57.039
of the Smurfs.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.210
[theme music]

01:04.170 --> 01:06.069
[bird chirping]

01:08.099 --> 01:10.090
[bird chirping]

01:14.230 --> 01:18.090
[yawns]
Alright, Smurfs, gather around.

01:18.109 --> 01:20.129
[indistinct chatter]

01:21.219 --> 01:24.129
Today we have work
to do on the bridge.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.010
So why don't you all
get started..

01:27.030 --> 01:30.099
...and I'll be along
in a few minutes.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.129
[hammering]

01:38.030 --> 01:39.009
[yawns]

01:39.030 --> 01:40.189
Time for a nap break.

01:40.210 --> 01:43.049
I think I'll just find
a cozy corner and--

01:43.069 --> 01:45.180
Lazy Smurf, where are you going?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.030
Oh, uh, I-I..

01:47.049 --> 01:49.210
Get back to work now,
like everyone else.

01:49.229 --> 01:51.189
Yes, Papa Smurf.

01:51.210 --> 01:54.189
Oh, these smurfs.
They wear me out.

01:56.189 --> 01:58.060
Hello, Hefty. How's it going?

01:58.079 --> 02:01.150
Oh, fine, Papa Smurf.
Uh, could you toss me a shovel?

02:03.109 --> 02:04.140
There you go.

02:05.090 --> 02:06.189
Unh! Ugh.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.098
Whose shovel is this?

02:08.120 --> 02:10.169
Oh, that's mine, Papa Smurf.

02:16.150 --> 02:19.229
Yoo-hoo, Papa Smurf,
don't you just love it?

02:20.009 --> 02:22.060
I picked the color
all by myself.

02:22.079 --> 02:25.009
With your eyes opened or closed?

02:25.030 --> 02:27.060
Very humorous, Papa Smurf.

02:27.079 --> 02:31.159
I always say that Papa Smurf
is a very humorous Smurf indeed.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.000
[snap]

02:36.139 --> 02:38.099
[clattering, then crash]

02:38.120 --> 02:39.180
Oh!

02:42.139 --> 02:46.099
My nerves can't take
much more of this. Oof!

02:46.120 --> 02:50.060
Lazy Smurf, go out in
the forest and cut some logs.

02:50.079 --> 02:53.129
Lots of logs and move it.

02:53.150 --> 02:55.139
[thunk]

02:55.159 --> 02:57.229
Why aren't these Smurfs
easier to live with?

02:58.009 --> 03:01.009
They're driving me
stark raving smurfy.

03:02.009 --> 03:04.120
Ah, my first log.

03:06.099 --> 03:07.219
[buzzing]

03:09.039 --> 03:11.090
[buzzing]

03:11.110 --> 03:13.210
Shoo, fly. Go away. Scat.

03:14.189 --> 03:16.069
[laughs]

03:18.020 --> 03:21.060
Beat it. Scram. Buzz off. Unh!

03:22.009 --> 03:23.159
[buzzing]

03:28.090 --> 03:30.099
Ow! Ouch!

03:30.120 --> 03:31.170
It bit me.

03:33.060 --> 03:36.000
Wh.. Wha-wha-what's happening?
I-I, I feel..

03:36.020 --> 03:37.229
[mumbling]

03:39.030 --> 03:43.020
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!
Ginnap! Ginnap!

03:43.039 --> 03:47.030
That Lazy Smurf sure is taking
his sweet time coming back.

03:47.050 --> 03:49.210
He's probably loafing
on the job, Papa Smurf.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.229
- In fact--
- Never mind, Brainy.

03:52.009 --> 03:53.159
Just go find him.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.229
Yes, Papa Smurf.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.199
Lazy, where are you?

04:02.039 --> 04:03.129
(Lazy Smurf)
'Ginnap!'

04:05.180 --> 04:07.180
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

04:07.199 --> 04:08.210
- Yipe!
- Ginnap!

04:08.229 --> 04:11.180
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

04:11.199 --> 04:12.210
Ginnap! Ginnap!

04:12.229 --> 04:14.050
Lazy's over there

04:14.069 --> 04:15.060
but he's all purple

04:15.080 --> 04:17.040
and all he says is, "Ginnap."

04:17.060 --> 04:19.170
Lazy's always talking
about a nap.

04:19.189 --> 04:22.160
- Like this, "Ginnap."
- Yipe!

04:22.180 --> 04:24.009
This is terrible.

04:24.029 --> 04:25.120
Lazy must have been bitten

04:25.139 --> 04:27.050
by a purple fly.

04:27.069 --> 04:29.139
(all)
'A purple fly?'

04:29.160 --> 04:30.230
Oh, there he is.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.000
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

04:33.019 --> 04:35.100
(Hefty)
He's headed for the village.
Catch him.

04:36.230 --> 04:39.120
- This way.
- Stop that Smurf.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.100
Ginnap! Ginnap!

04:41.120 --> 04:44.129
[all clamoring]

04:45.220 --> 04:47.009
We got him.

04:47.029 --> 04:48.090
Poor Lazy.

04:48.110 --> 04:49.170
Take him to his house.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.220
Ginnap! Ginnap!

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
The last case of this
was when I was

04:53.019 --> 04:54.180
only a young smurfling

04:54.199 --> 04:56.159
barely a hundred years old.

04:56.180 --> 04:59.189
And I can't remember
what the cure was.

05:00.209 --> 05:03.170
[grunting]

05:06.129 --> 05:07.170
[snickers]

05:09.079 --> 05:10.199
[door creaks]

05:10.220 --> 05:13.060
Ginnap! Ginnap!

05:13.079 --> 05:16.199
I must find the proper formula
to help poor Lazy.

05:16.220 --> 05:18.110
- Ginnap!
- Ow!

05:18.129 --> 05:21.050
That Purple Smurf bit me.
He-he..

05:21.069 --> 05:23.129
[stammering]

05:23.149 --> 05:26.060
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

05:26.079 --> 05:27.069
[door slams]

05:27.089 --> 05:29.120
(both)
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

05:31.220 --> 05:32.220
Ginnap! Ginnap!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.149
Great smurf, it's catching.

05:34.170 --> 05:38.090
Everyone out. I must discover
a cure before it's too late.

05:40.009 --> 05:41.209
[crickets chittering]

05:45.029 --> 05:46.159
[yawns]

05:49.009 --> 05:50.189
[rooster crows]

05:52.029 --> 05:54.170
Wake up, Smurfs.
I think I found the cure.

05:54.189 --> 05:57.180
But to test it,
we must catch a purple Smurf.

05:57.199 --> 06:01.060
It will be dangerous.
The purples are contagious.

06:01.079 --> 06:02.220
Are there any volunteers?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.069
(all)
Me.

06:06.170 --> 06:09.149
Okay, let's split up
and search every bush.

06:12.079 --> 06:13.149
Ginnap! Ginnap!

06:13.170 --> 06:15.149
Hey, I found one.

06:19.220 --> 06:21.050
Ginnap!

06:28.120 --> 06:31.029
(Clumsy)
'Uh, help. Help!'

06:31.050 --> 06:32.220
- 'Ginnap.'
- 'Ow!'

06:34.040 --> 06:36.189
He-he bit me, and I feel..

06:36.209 --> 06:39.040
[stammering]

06:39.060 --> 06:40.110
Ginnap!

06:43.060 --> 06:47.040
Hey, I captured one
single-smurfedly.

06:47.060 --> 06:50.209
Oh, Brainy, I had no idea
you were so brave.

06:50.230 --> 06:53.230
- Ah, Smurfette, it was--
- Ginnap!

06:54.009 --> 06:55.090
Nothing. He-he.

06:56.220 --> 06:58.189
Okay, let's get started.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.149
Handy, pinch his tail.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.069
[screams]

07:06.199 --> 07:09.060
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

07:09.079 --> 07:11.209
[mumbling]

07:15.139 --> 07:16.189
He's still purple.

07:16.209 --> 07:19.050
Quickly, untie him,
and put him in bed.

07:19.069 --> 07:21.189
- Poor Smurf.
- Yeah.

07:21.209 --> 07:23.189
It's enough to ruin
your appetite.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.170
- Ginnap!
- Yeow!

07:28.189 --> 07:29.180
He bit me.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.009
[stammering]

07:32.029 --> 07:33.090
- Ginnap!
- Get away.

07:33.110 --> 07:34.180
- Ginnap!
- Papa Smurf!

07:34.199 --> 07:36.129
Ginnap!

07:36.149 --> 07:38.069
- Ginnap!
- 'Ow!'

07:38.090 --> 07:41.149
This is a disaster.
I must find another remedy.

07:43.009 --> 07:46.159
Smurfs, I hope this ointment
will do the trick.

07:46.180 --> 07:49.060
But once again,
I'll need volunteers to--

07:49.079 --> 07:52.019
- No, not me.
- No, no, no.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.100
Oh, so that's it.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.139
You, you and you are elected.

07:56.159 --> 07:58.079
Now, smurf to it.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.089
(all)
Yes, Papa Smurf.

08:01.050 --> 08:03.209
[panting]

08:03.230 --> 08:07.110
Good job, smurfs.
Now, to apply the ointment.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.029
[grunting]

08:11.050 --> 08:12.029
Ginnap!

08:12.050 --> 08:14.050
[all clamoring]

08:15.120 --> 08:17.189
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

08:17.209 --> 08:22.029
Smurfs, none of my remedies have
worked, and time is running out.

08:22.050 --> 08:24.029
Fifteen smurfs are infected now.

08:24.050 --> 08:25.050
- 'Ginnap!'
- 'Ow!'

08:25.069 --> 08:26.160
And these, uh, 16..

08:26.180 --> 08:27.189
- 'Ginnap!'
- 'Ow!'

08:27.209 --> 08:29.230
(Papa Smurf)
'Uh, 17, must be cured'

08:30.009 --> 08:31.149
before we become extinct.

08:33.009 --> 08:34.190
Our last hope is to capture

08:34.210 --> 08:36.149
the dreaded purple fly.

08:36.169 --> 08:39.029
Perhaps we can learn from it
what the cure is.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.110
Go and good smurfing.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.009
- 'Ginnap!'
- 'Ow.'

08:49.029 --> 08:51.009
Oh, no, another one!

08:51.169 --> 08:54.009
[buzzing]

08:54.029 --> 08:57.159
Ooh! We caught the purple fly!
We caught it!

08:59.090 --> 09:00.080
Yipe!

09:00.100 --> 09:01.200
Run! It's hornet!

09:04.019 --> 09:05.179
[buzzing]

09:05.200 --> 09:06.220
[splash]

09:12.139 --> 09:14.110
[buzzing]

09:14.129 --> 09:16.039
Aha, I found it.

09:18.210 --> 09:20.080
Gotcha.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.070
Hey, put me down.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.210
Help! Help!

09:27.019 --> 09:28.090
[Papa Smurf grunts]

09:30.039 --> 09:32.039
[buzzing]

09:32.059 --> 09:36.009
Argh. I've tried everything
and nothing works.

09:36.029 --> 09:38.000
I'll just feed it
a tuberose flower

09:38.019 --> 09:39.210
and go and get some rest.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.190
[sneezes]

09:43.210 --> 09:46.070
(Papa Smurf)
Eureka, it turned blue.

09:46.090 --> 09:49.039
That's the remedy.
Tuberose pollen.

09:49.059 --> 09:52.169
Quickly, Smurfs, gather all the
tuberose flowers you can find

09:52.190 --> 09:54.080
and smurf to it.

09:57.070 --> 09:58.139
Ginnap! Ginnap!

10:04.049 --> 10:06.090
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

10:06.110 --> 10:09.129
(Papa Smurf)
Good work, Smurfs.
The pollen is ready.

10:09.149 --> 10:12.080
When you run out,
refill from this jar.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.179
Papa Smurf. Oh, Papa Smurf.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.210
Look, the purples are coming.

10:16.230 --> 10:18.169
(all)
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

10:18.190 --> 10:20.090

Charge!

10:28.179 --> 10:31.139
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

10:31.159 --> 10:33.039

10:36.059 --> 10:37.070

10:37.090 --> 10:38.090
Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

10:38.110 --> 10:42.100
A...a-achoo!

10:42.120 --> 10:44.090
Uh, uh, what happened?

10:44.110 --> 10:46.000
(Smurfette)
Lazy, look out.

10:46.019 --> 10:47.179
- 'Ginnap.'
- Ow!

10:50.070 --> 10:51.190
Ginnap! Ginnap!

10:51.210 --> 10:53.080
Don't give up, smurfs.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.110
- Yipe!
- Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

10:55.129 --> 10:57.190
- Ginnap!
- Ye-ouch!

Ow!

Ginnap! Ginnap! Ginnap!

11:15.210 --> 11:18.000
Stand your ground,
my little smurfs.

11:18.019 --> 11:19.220
Smurfs? Where are you?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.169
Great smurf,
I'm the only one left

11:22.190 --> 11:24.120
and I'm out of pollen.

11:24.139 --> 11:26.129
- Ginnap! Ginnap!
- I must get more from the lab.
