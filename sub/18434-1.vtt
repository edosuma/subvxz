05:16.417 --> 05:19.420
Every second bastard born
is fathered by a priest.

05:25.176 --> 05:27.119
But in Utopia that couldn't be.

05:27.219 --> 05:28.245
For why?

05:28.345 --> 05:31.724
- For there the priests are very holy.
- Therefore very few.

05:34.184 --> 05:36.436
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?

05:37.103 --> 05:40.607
- Bless you, sir. I don't know.
- Bless you too, Matthew.

05:45.862 --> 05:48.348
To be sure, we have
some holy priests in England.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.784
- Oh, name some.
- Brother James.

05:51.367 --> 05:53.203
Man's a simpleton.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.414
It's from Cardinal Wolsey.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.334
What's he want?

05:59.918 --> 06:01.044
- Me.
- When?

06:01.169 --> 06:02.045
Now.

06:02.212 --> 06:05.089
In Hampton Court?
You won't be there by midnight.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.467
- The King's business.
- Queen's business.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.094
Mistress Anne Boleyn's business.

06:11.220 --> 06:14.389
Well, it's all the Cardinal's business.

06:14.515 --> 06:18.711
That's very true. And when the Cardinal
calls, you all come running, day or night.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.814
What is the man? A butcher's son.

06:22.106 --> 06:23.674
Chancellor of England, too.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.276
No, that's his office. What's the man?

06:27.152 --> 06:30.264
Surely, Your Grace, when a man
rises so high and so swiftly...

06:30.364 --> 06:33.242
we must think he was misplaced
in his origins.

06:34.743 --> 06:37.287
That, at least,
was the opinion of Aristotle and...

06:38.497 --> 06:40.457
A butcher's son and looks it.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.167
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.380
What was that you said, Richard?

06:48.548 --> 06:50.550
Nothing, Sir Thomas,
it was out of place.

06:52.009 --> 06:54.011
And Wolsey's still a butcher.

06:54.512 --> 06:57.999
And you're a member of the King's
High Council, not an errand boy.

06:58.099 --> 06:59.767
That is why I must go.

07:00.226 --> 07:02.895
The Duke would go
if the Cardinal called him.

07:03.646 --> 07:04.856
I might.

07:06.941 --> 07:08.776
I'll be back for breakfast.

07:09.694 --> 07:10.820
Go to bed.

07:12.405 --> 07:16.409
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight,
or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.

07:16.534 --> 07:20.996
"Careful only for our soul's salvation.
For Christ's sake. Amen."

07:22.372 --> 07:24.291
And bless our lord, the King.

07:25.292 --> 07:27.944
- "And bless our lord, the King."
- Amen!

07:28.044 --> 07:30.797
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.

07:35.677 --> 07:38.722
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He's a frightened man.

07:40.974 --> 07:43.727
- Who is that?
- A young friend from Cambridge.

07:43.852 --> 07:46.938
- What's he want?
- What do they all want? A position.

07:47.147 --> 07:50.150
- Can you give him a position?
- Do you recommend him?

07:50.776 --> 07:51.817
No.

08:09.418 --> 08:11.420
- Sir Thomas.
- No.

08:12.046 --> 08:14.215
- Did you recommend me?
- No.

08:16.342 --> 08:18.761
Richard, I may have a position for you.

08:18.886 --> 08:23.015
- What? What position?
- Not now, Richard. Tomorrow.

09:04.888 --> 09:06.473
For you all, boatman.

09:07.182 --> 09:08.517
Thank you, sir.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.791
Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.

09:33.292 --> 09:34.667
Master Cromwell.

09:49.223 --> 09:52.727
You opposed me in the Council
this morning, Thomas.

09:53.561 --> 09:54.937
Yes, Your Grace.

09:55.855 --> 09:59.025
- You were the only one.
- Yes, Your Grace.

10:00.443 --> 10:01.694
You're a fool.

10:03.112 --> 10:05.907
Thank God there is only one fool
on the Council.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.620
Why did you oppose me?

10:12.579 --> 10:14.623
I thought Your Grace was wrong.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.959
A matter of conscience.

10:20.128 --> 10:22.506
You're a constant regret to me, Thomas.

10:23.298 --> 10:25.784
If you could just see facts flat on...

10:25.884 --> 10:29.054
without that horrible moral squint.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.809
With a little common sense,
you could have made a statesman.

10:40.315 --> 10:41.399
The King.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.637
Where's he been? Do you know?

11:12.680 --> 11:13.931
I, Your Grace?

11:14.849 --> 11:16.933
Spare me your discretion.

11:18.351 --> 11:22.355
He's been to play in the muck again.

11:24.607 --> 11:26.776
He's been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.

11:32.449 --> 11:36.244
More, are you going to help me?

11:38.913 --> 11:41.541
If Your Grace will be specific.

11:42.584 --> 11:45.920
You're a plodder! All right, we'll plod.

11:46.588 --> 11:49.758
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?

11:50.008 --> 11:54.052
I'm very sure the King needs no advice
from me on what to do about it.

11:54.887 --> 11:58.332
Thomas, we're alone.
I give you my word, there's no one here.

11:58.432 --> 12:00.851
I didn't suppose there was, Your Grace.

12:04.438 --> 12:08.133
Do you favor a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?

12:08.233 --> 12:09.426
For God's sake, Your Grace!

12:09.526 --> 12:13.030
Then he needs a son. I repeat,
what are you going to do about it?

12:13.155 --> 12:14.390
I pray for it daily.

12:14.490 --> 12:16.784
God's death, he means it.

12:17.576 --> 12:20.829
That thing out there,
at least she's fertile.

12:21.663 --> 12:24.274
- But she's not his wife.
- No, Catherine's his wife...

12:24.374 --> 12:27.735
and she's barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?

12:27.835 --> 12:29.420
There are precedents.

12:33.424 --> 12:37.011
All right. Good. Pray by all means.

12:38.304 --> 12:43.893
But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.

12:47.522 --> 12:49.816
Have I your support, or have I not?

12:53.361 --> 12:57.240
The Pope gave a dispensation,
so that the King might marry...

12:57.365 --> 12:59.950
his brother's widow for state reasons.

13:00.659 --> 13:06.023
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with
his dispensation, also for state reasons?

13:06.123 --> 13:08.275
I don't like plodding, Thomas. Well?

13:08.375 --> 13:12.571
Then, clearly all we have to do is
to approach His Holiness and ask him.

13:12.671 --> 13:15.841
I think we might influence
the decision of His Holiness.

13:16.591 --> 13:17.659
By argument?

13:17.759 --> 13:21.638
Argument certainly. And pressure.

13:22.931 --> 13:27.185
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.

13:29.271 --> 13:30.439
Pressure.

13:37.111 --> 13:40.614
No, Your Grace,
I'm not going to help you.

13:43.492 --> 13:46.745
Then goodnight, Master More.

13:50.082 --> 13:55.004
Let the dynasty die with Henry VIII
and we'll have dynastic wars again.

13:55.337 --> 13:58.549
Blood-witted barons ramping the country
from end to end.

13:59.383 --> 14:02.970
Is that what you want? Very well.

14:04.054 --> 14:06.015
England needs an heir.

14:07.433 --> 14:11.770
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...

14:12.479 --> 14:16.399
perhaps not, there's much in the Church
which needs reformation, Thomas.

14:18.610 --> 14:22.697
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.

14:24.949 --> 14:28.937
Now, explain how you, as a councilor
of England, can obstruct these measures...

14:29.037 --> 14:31.915
for the sake
of your own private conscience.

14:34.042 --> 14:37.837
I think that when statesmen forsake
their own private conscience...

14:37.962 --> 14:40.507
for the sake of their public duties...

14:40.632 --> 14:44.301
they lead their country
by a short route to chaos.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.974
And we shall have my prayers
to fall back on.

14:51.683 --> 14:55.896
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
To govern the country with prayers?

14:56.438 --> 14:57.689
Yes, I should.

14:58.524 --> 15:00.692
I'd like to be there when you try.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.947
Who will wear this after me?

15:06.532 --> 15:10.953
Who's our next chancellor?
You? Fisher? Suffolk?

15:11.412 --> 15:13.580
- Fisher for me.
- Aye, but for the King?

15:13.997 --> 15:17.208
What about my secretary,
Master Cromwell?

15:17.875 --> 15:21.921
Cromwell. He's a very able man.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.215
But?

15:24.966 --> 15:27.260
Me rather than Cromwell.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.054
Then, come down to earth.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.142
Until you do...

15:36.602 --> 15:38.521
you and I are enemies.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.941
As Your Grace wishes.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.279
As God wills.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.489
Perhaps, Your Grace.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.535
More! You should have been a cleric!

15:54.369 --> 15:56.163
Like yourself, Your Grace?

16:10.093 --> 16:11.720
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.

16:18.852 --> 16:19.978
Sir Thomas.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.022
Sir Thomas.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.316
Sir Thomas.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.904
- What's this?
- From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.

16:30.654 --> 16:33.908
- Leicester?
- You do more good than you know, sir.

16:36.118 --> 16:40.289
My daughter has a case, sir,
in the Court of Poor Man's Causes.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.501
Baked apples, sir.

16:44.085 --> 16:45.795
To sweeten my judgment.

16:46.545 --> 16:49.907
I'll give your daughter the same judgment
I would give my own.

16:50.007 --> 16:52.426
A fair one, quickly.

16:52.843 --> 16:54.036
Bless you, sir.

16:54.136 --> 16:57.807
I understand. Yes. I'll read it.
Yes. Thank you.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.271
Good evening, Sir Thomas.

17:06.231 --> 17:08.465
- I'll read it.
- It's an awkward case.

17:08.566 --> 17:10.844
- I could illuminate it for you...
- I'll read it.

17:10.944 --> 17:12.569
Just a moment or two...

17:14.656 --> 17:15.698
Boat!

17:16.324 --> 17:16.866
Sir?

17:39.596 --> 17:40.706
Chelsea, sir?

17:40.806 --> 17:41.849
Chelsea.

17:42.516 --> 17:44.918
I expect you'll make it
worth my while, sir.

17:45.018 --> 17:48.422
- You've got a license?
- Bless you, yes sir, I've got a license.

17:48.522 --> 17:51.108
- Well then, the fares are fixed.
- They are, sir.

17:51.233 --> 17:53.844
Hampton to Chelsea downstream,
a penny halfpenny.

17:53.944 --> 17:56.096
Chelsea to Hampton upstream,
a penny halfpenny.

17:56.196 --> 17:58.657
Whoever makes the regulations
doesn't row a boat.

17:59.158 --> 18:02.686
No. Three pence if you get me home
for breakfast.

18:02.786 --> 18:04.079
Thank you, sir.

18:32.190 --> 18:33.566
A nice cup, sir.

18:35.401 --> 18:36.319
Yes.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.712
That's worth money, sir.

19:33.457 --> 19:34.750
Mind a way, sir.

19:41.382 --> 19:42.675
Thank you, sir.

19:49.890 --> 19:52.100
- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.

19:53.685 --> 19:56.020
You said there was a post?

19:56.646 --> 20:02.068
Yes. I'll offer you a post, with a house,
a servant and £50 a year.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.528
What post?

20:04.195 --> 20:05.947
At the new school.

20:08.825 --> 20:09.951
A teacher!

20:10.952 --> 20:14.038
Richard, no one's going to give you
a place at court.

20:15.749 --> 20:18.251
Master Cromwell says
he'll do something for me.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.004
Cromwell?

20:22.380 --> 20:25.008
Well, if you know Cromwell
you don't need my help.

20:26.467 --> 20:27.634
Sir Thomas?

20:30.262 --> 20:34.183
If only you knew how much,
much rather, I had your help than his.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.020
Not to a place at court.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.022
Why not?

20:42.483 --> 20:43.400
Look.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.529
- What is it?
- It's a bribe!

20:50.282 --> 20:53.410
"I am the gift of Averil Machin."

20:54.787 --> 20:58.082
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit
in the Court of Requests.

20:58.957 --> 21:03.711
Italian silver. Take it. No joke.

21:06.339 --> 21:07.465
Thank you.

21:10.593 --> 21:12.095
What will you do with it?

21:12.887 --> 21:13.538
Sell it.

21:13.638 --> 21:15.973
- And buy what?
- A decent gown!

21:17.183 --> 21:19.393
But Richard, that's a little bribe.

21:20.144 --> 21:25.608
At court they offer you all sorts of things,
home, manor houses, coats of arms.

21:26.317 --> 21:28.861
A man should go
where he won't be tempted.

21:29.904 --> 21:34.741
Why not be a teacher? You'd be
a fine teacher. Perhaps a great one.

21:35.867 --> 21:40.414
- If I was, who would know it?
- You! Your pupils. Your friends.

21:40.789 --> 21:43.583
God. Not a bad public, that.

21:47.587 --> 21:49.464
And a quiet life.

21:49.798 --> 21:52.701
You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.

21:52.801 --> 21:55.220
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.

21:56.471 --> 21:59.958
It's eating your heart out, isn't it?
The high affairs of state.

22:00.058 --> 22:01.268
The divorce?

22:02.561 --> 22:03.729
Boatman!

22:04.229 --> 22:05.105
Sir?

22:05.230 --> 22:07.841
- Take this gentleman to the New Inn!
- Right, sir.

22:07.941 --> 22:09.316
Sir Thomas?

22:10.359 --> 22:11.485
Thank you.

22:12.903 --> 22:14.530
Be a teacher.

22:25.040 --> 22:25.941
- Matthew.
- Sir.

22:26.041 --> 22:27.960
- Lady Alice in bed?
- Yes, sir.

22:28.461 --> 22:30.004
- Lady Margaret?
- No, sir.

22:30.463 --> 22:32.365
The Master Roper's here, sir.

22:32.465 --> 22:34.425
At this hour? Who let him in?

22:35.217 --> 22:37.386
He's a hard man to keep out, sir.

23:00.867 --> 23:02.952
Will wants to marry me, Father.

23:03.828 --> 23:05.538
Well, he can't marry you.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.025
Sir Thomas, I'm called to the Bar.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.753
Oh, congratulations, Roper.

23:12.087 --> 23:14.464
My family may not be at the palace,
but in the city...

23:14.756 --> 23:17.008
There's nothing wrong
with your family, Will.

23:18.801 --> 23:20.886
There's not much wrong with you.

23:22.096 --> 23:24.181
Except you seem to need a clock.

23:24.848 --> 23:26.558
I can buy a clock, sir.

23:26.809 --> 23:28.335
Roper, the answer is no...

23:28.435 --> 23:31.005
and will be no as long
as you're a heretic.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.340
Now, that's a word I don't like,
Sir Thomas!

23:33.440 --> 23:35.384
It's not a likeable word or thing.

23:35.484 --> 23:39.096
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther's proved that to my satisfaction!

23:39.196 --> 23:40.931
Luther is an excommunicate!

23:41.031 --> 23:43.951
From a heretic Church!
Church? It's a shop!

23:44.243 --> 23:47.621
- Salvation by the shilling! And divorces!
- Will, no!

23:47.788 --> 23:50.916
- What I know, I'll say!
- You've no sense of the place!

23:52.083 --> 23:53.876
He's no sense of the time.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.087
Now listen well.

23:56.462 --> 23:58.990
Two years ago you were
a passionate churchman.

23:59.090 --> 24:01.034
Now you're a passionate Lutheran.

24:01.134 --> 24:04.162
We must just pray
that when your head's finished turning...

24:04.262 --> 24:06.472
your face is to the front again.

24:08.516 --> 24:11.144
- Is your horse here?
- No, sir, I walked.

24:12.145 --> 24:14.897
Well, take a horse from the stables
and get back home.

24:16.816 --> 24:17.859
Go along.

24:19.485 --> 24:20.903
May I come again?

24:23.239 --> 24:25.199
Yes. Soon.

24:30.746 --> 24:32.372
Is that final, Father?

24:32.622 --> 24:35.459
As long as he's a heretic, Meg,
that's absolute.

24:39.379 --> 24:41.131
What did Wolsey want?

24:44.384 --> 24:45.969
Nice boy, young Will.

24:48.305 --> 24:50.724
Terribly strong principles, though.

24:51.808 --> 24:53.310
Clumsy, too.

24:54.102 --> 24:56.938
- You're very pensive.
- You're very gay.

24:57.522 --> 24:59.024
Was it the divorce?

25:00.691 --> 25:01.734
To bed.

25:02.651 --> 25:07.031
They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.408
Old Roper was just the same...

25:10.951 --> 25:13.037
You don't want to talk about it.

25:13.954 --> 25:14.872
No.

25:19.919 --> 25:23.756
- I'm sorry you were awakened, chick.
- I wasn't sleeping very deeply.

25:24.215 --> 25:25.800
What did Wolsey want?

25:27.968 --> 25:30.596
- Will Roper's been.
- Will Roper?

25:30.846 --> 25:33.708
Yes, he's been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.

25:33.808 --> 25:36.351
- Why you don't beat that girl I...
- No.

25:36.893 --> 25:40.522
She's full of education
and it's a delicate commodity.

25:41.231 --> 25:42.524
Goodnight, Meg.

25:42.816 --> 25:43.942
Goodnight.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.932
Marry Meg. A lawyer's son.

25:51.032 --> 25:52.867
Well, she's a lawyer's daughter.

25:56.287 --> 26:00.625
Norfolk spoke of you for Chancellor
of England before he left.

26:01.501 --> 26:03.420
Well, he's a dangerous friend then.

26:04.504 --> 26:06.673
Wolsey's chancellor, God help him.

26:06.965 --> 26:09.117
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you...

26:09.217 --> 26:13.178
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp
a few small boats like ours.

26:13.679 --> 26:14.722
No.

26:15.305 --> 26:18.308
There'll be no new chancellors
while Wolsey lives.

27:08.483 --> 27:11.194
The Duke of Norfolk,
Earl Marshal of England.

27:25.874 --> 27:28.210
Have you any message for His Majesty?

27:30.670 --> 27:32.297
If I had served God...

27:32.714 --> 27:35.467
one half so well
as I've served my King...

27:36.676 --> 27:40.931
God would not have left me here,
to die in this place.

27:42.724 --> 27:46.686
Thank God you're dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.004
"I am straightly charged
by the King himself...

28:14.797 --> 28:18.426
"here openly to declare
how much all England...

28:18.551 --> 28:20.720
"is beholden to this man.

28:21.137 --> 28:25.975
"And how worthy he is
to have the highest room in the realm.

28:26.475 --> 28:30.478
"And how dearly the King's grace
doth love and trust him...

28:31.438 --> 28:33.773
"not only for much good council...

28:34.190 --> 28:37.819
"deliberate council,
but for better council yet...

28:38.570 --> 28:41.281
"that which is privy
to the King's person.

28:42.449 --> 28:44.534
"This same Sir Thomas More...

28:44.826 --> 28:47.579
"here made before you all to be...

28:48.163 --> 28:50.957
"Lord Chancellor of the Realm."

30:30.554 --> 30:32.080
Calm yourself, Matthew.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.849
Fetch Lady Alice.

30:46.235 --> 30:47.945
That's very well.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.285
My lady! The King!

31:59.681 --> 32:01.834
Now remember, the visit's a surprise.

32:01.934 --> 32:03.794
But he'll know we're expecting him...

32:03.894 --> 32:06.630
It's a very great honor.
One friend calling on another.

32:06.730 --> 32:08.382
What's he really coming for?

32:08.482 --> 32:10.843
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.

32:10.943 --> 32:13.387
- But he's had his answer.
- He wants another.

32:13.487 --> 32:14.488
Thomas!

32:21.870 --> 32:25.774
Your Majesty does my house more honor
than I fear my household will bear.

32:25.874 --> 32:28.084
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!

32:28.209 --> 32:30.778
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.

32:30.878 --> 32:32.213
Look. Mud.

32:36.217 --> 32:39.220
By heaven, what an evening.

32:40.179 --> 32:43.082
Lady Alice,
I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.

32:43.182 --> 32:45.768
Yes, Your Grace. Well, no, Your Grace.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.296
Well, that is,
we are ready to entertain...

32:48.396 --> 32:50.815
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.

32:52.567 --> 32:55.403
She's not yet had the honor
to meet Your Grace.

32:55.611 --> 32:58.740
Why Margaret,
they told me you were a scholar.

32:59.532 --> 33:01.241
Answer, Margaret.

33:01.450 --> 33:04.202
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.

33:35.233 --> 33:36.984
Can you dance, too?

33:37.693 --> 33:39.278
Not well, Your Grace.

33:41.405 --> 33:43.574
Well, I dance superlatively!

33:44.492 --> 33:46.911
That's a dancer's leg, Margaret!

34:00.007 --> 34:02.243
Lady Alice,
the river's given me an appetite.

34:02.343 --> 34:05.496
If Your Grace would share
a very simple supper.

34:05.596 --> 34:07.665
It would please me. Lead them in.

34:07.765 --> 34:09.208
Thomas and I will follow.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.683
Matthew.

34:11.101 --> 34:13.395
My lords and gentlemen!

34:19.025 --> 34:20.318
Margaret?

34:20.610 --> 34:21.969
Your Grace?

34:22.070 --> 34:23.696
Do you like music?

34:23.822 --> 34:25.407
Yes, Your Grace.

34:25.907 --> 34:27.742
They'll play to you.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.891
Now, listen to this.

34:56.645 --> 34:57.980
Sit down.

34:59.773 --> 35:02.067
Be seated. No courtship, Thomas.

35:06.447 --> 35:08.741
You're my friend, are you not?

35:09.283 --> 35:10.309
Your Majesty.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.937
Thank God I have a friend
for my chancellor.

35:13.037 --> 35:16.065
Readier to befriend, I trust,
than he was to be chancellor.

35:16.165 --> 35:18.359
My own knowledge of my poor abilities...

35:18.459 --> 35:20.752
I will judge of your abilities.

35:21.669 --> 35:22.712
Thomas?

35:25.840 --> 35:28.760
You know that Wolsey named you
for chancellor?

35:29.844 --> 35:34.057
Before he died, Wolsey named you,
and Wolsey was no fool.

35:34.640 --> 35:38.269
He was a statesman
of incomparable ability, Your Grace.

35:40.563 --> 35:41.814
Was he?

35:43.232 --> 35:44.609
Was he so?

35:45.693 --> 35:47.737
Then, why did he fail me?

35:50.364 --> 35:52.200
It was villainy then.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.185
Yes, villainy.
Secret opposition, secret.

35:55.285 --> 35:58.689
But deliberate, willful,
meditated opposition.

35:58.789 --> 36:01.316
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.

36:01.416 --> 36:02.901
What is it? Thought!

36:03.001 --> 36:07.447
Because I'm simple and plain and deal
with every man straightforwardly.

36:07.547 --> 36:11.468
Because of that I say,
do they take me for a simpleton?

36:16.431 --> 36:21.228
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.

36:22.312 --> 36:23.897
Pride right through.

36:24.147 --> 36:25.565
And he failed me.

36:26.733 --> 36:30.069
Failed me in the one thing that matters,
then as now.

36:33.864 --> 36:34.990
But look.

36:35.950 --> 36:37.118
Be seated.

36:42.498 --> 36:43.874
What an evening.

36:45.084 --> 36:47.211
A man could fight a lion.

36:47.628 --> 36:49.755
Some men could, Your Grace.

36:51.090 --> 36:52.258
Thomas...

36:53.384 --> 36:56.053
touching this matter of my divorce.

36:56.470 --> 36:58.706
Have you thought of it
since we last spoke?

36:58.806 --> 36:59.874
Of little else.

36:59.974 --> 37:01.833
Then you see your way clear to me?

37:01.933 --> 37:04.811
That you should put away
Queen Catherine, sire?

37:05.061 --> 37:07.130
Alas, as I think of it,
I see so clearly...

37:07.230 --> 37:10.342
that I cannot come with Your Grace,
that my endeavor is...

37:10.442 --> 37:11.801
not to think of it at all.

37:11.901 --> 37:14.320
Then you haven't thought enough!

37:21.494 --> 37:22.704
Lilac.

37:24.247 --> 37:25.957
We have them at Hampton.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.710
Not so fine as this, though.

37:31.046 --> 37:33.590
I'm in an excellent frame of mind.

37:38.260 --> 37:42.039
Thomas, you must consider,
I stand in peril of my soul.

37:42.139 --> 37:43.640
It was no marriage.

37:44.183 --> 37:47.352
I have lived in incest
with my brother's widow.

37:48.312 --> 37:53.342
Leviticus: "Thou shalt not uncover
the nakedness of thy brother's wife."

37:53.442 --> 37:55.761
Leviticus. Chapter 18, verse 16.

37:55.861 --> 37:57.721
Yes, Your Grace. But Deuteronomy...

37:57.821 --> 37:59.807
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!

37:59.907 --> 38:02.559
Your Grace, I'm not fitted
to meddle in these matters.

38:02.659 --> 38:04.770
To me, it seems a matter
for the Holy See...

38:04.870 --> 38:08.624
Thomas, does a man need a pope
to tell him where he's sinned?

38:10.291 --> 38:11.793
It was a sin.

38:12.627 --> 38:14.379
God's punished me.

38:15.380 --> 38:16.839
I've no son.

38:18.299 --> 38:20.118
Son after son she's borne me.

38:20.218 --> 38:23.221
All dead at birth,
or dead within the month.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.082
I never saw the hand of God
so clear in anything.

38:26.182 --> 38:28.334
It's my bounden duty
to put away the Queen.

38:28.434 --> 38:32.021
And all the popes, back to Peter,
shall not come between me and my duty!

38:34.565 --> 38:37.051
How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.

38:37.151 --> 38:40.279
Then, why does Your Grace
need my poor support?

38:40.780 --> 38:42.198
Because you're honest.

38:42.699 --> 38:45.517
And what is more to the purpose,
you're known to be honest.

38:45.617 --> 38:48.145
Those like Norfolk follow me
because I wear the crown.

38:48.245 --> 38:51.690
Those like Cromwell follow
because they're jackals with sharp teeth...

38:51.790 --> 38:53.984
and I'm their tiger.
A mass follows me...

38:54.084 --> 38:56.044
because it follows anything that moves.

38:58.588 --> 38:59.840
And then there's you.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.470
I am sick to think
how much I must displease Your Grace.

39:06.096 --> 39:09.808
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.

39:13.145 --> 39:14.771
But respect...

39:15.397 --> 39:18.191
man, that's water in the desert.

39:23.738 --> 39:25.139
How'd you like our music?

39:25.239 --> 39:27.350
That air they played,
it had a certain...

39:27.450 --> 39:29.936
Well, tell me what you thought of it.

39:30.036 --> 39:32.288
Could it have been Your Grace's own?

39:32.663 --> 39:33.831
Discovered!

39:34.665 --> 39:37.610
Now I'll never know your true opinion,
and that's irksome.

39:37.710 --> 39:41.172
Well, we artists, we love praise,
yet we love truth better.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.741
- Then I will tell my true opinion.
- Well?

39:43.841 --> 39:47.053
To me it seemed delightful.

39:48.971 --> 39:53.166
Thomas, I chose the right man
for chancellor.

39:53.266 --> 39:57.520
I should in fairness add that my taste
in music is reputedly deplorable.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.590
Your taste in music is excellent!

40:00.690 --> 40:02.901
It exactly coincides with my own.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.531
Music.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.409
Music.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.606
Send them back without me, Thomas.
I'll live here in Chelsea and make music.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.900
My house is at Your Grace's disposal.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.503
Touching this other business,
mark you...

40:23.880 --> 40:25.799
I'll have no opposition.

40:27.549 --> 40:28.951
Your Grace.

40:29.051 --> 40:33.305
No opposition, I say. No opposition.

40:34.264 --> 40:35.641
Be seated.

40:38.685 --> 40:43.148
I'll leave you out of it
but you are my chancellor.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.404
I don't take it kindly
and I'll have no opposition!

40:50.906 --> 40:52.783
I see how it will be.

40:53.992 --> 40:56.161
The bishops will oppose me!

40:56.578 --> 41:01.208
The full-fed princes of the Church!
Hypocrites! All hypocrites!

41:01.375 --> 41:03.710
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!

41:03.835 --> 41:05.403
Your Grace is unjust.

41:05.503 --> 41:08.615
If I cannot serve Your Grace
in this great matter of the Queen.

41:08.715 --> 41:11.092
I have no queen!

41:11.759 --> 41:13.803
Catherine's not my wife!

41:14.554 --> 41:16.681
No priest can make her so.

41:17.390 --> 41:21.102
They that say she is my wife
are not only liars, but traitors!

41:23.104 --> 41:24.647
Yes, traitors!

41:25.481 --> 41:27.275
That I will not brook now!

41:27.900 --> 41:29.068
Treachery!

41:30.194 --> 41:31.387
I will not brook.

41:31.487 --> 41:32.822
It maddens me!

41:33.239 --> 41:38.827
It is a deadly canker in the body politic,
and I will have it out!

41:48.670 --> 41:49.796
See?

41:51.965 --> 41:54.259
You see how you've maddened me?

41:54.843 --> 41:57.137
I hardly know myself.

42:04.978 --> 42:08.048
If you could come with me,
there's no man I'd sooner raise...

42:08.148 --> 42:10.025
yes, with my own hand.

42:10.359 --> 42:12.443
Your Grace overwhelms me.

42:22.370 --> 42:23.829
What's that?

42:24.330 --> 42:25.998
Eight o'clock, Your Grace.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.877
Lift yourself up, man.

42:33.839 --> 42:36.550
Have I not promised
I'll leave you out of it?

42:38.177 --> 42:39.470
Shall we eat?

42:39.595 --> 42:41.222
If Your Grace pleases.

42:45.558 --> 42:47.102
Eight o'clock, you said.

42:48.687 --> 42:50.438
The tide will be turning.

42:50.814 --> 42:53.983
- I was forgetting the tide. I must go.
- I'm sorry, Your Grace.

42:54.484 --> 42:57.429
If I don't catch the tide
I'll not get back to Richmond.

42:57.529 --> 42:59.072
No, don't come.

43:02.659 --> 43:06.313
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.

43:06.413 --> 43:09.082
So we give you our thanks
and we say goodnight!

43:31.437 --> 43:32.730
What's this?

43:33.313 --> 43:35.174
- You crossed him!
- Somewhat.

43:35.274 --> 43:37.384
- Why?
- I couldn't find the other way.

43:37.484 --> 43:39.511
You're too nice altogether, Thomas.

43:39.611 --> 43:43.115
- Woman, mind your house!
- I am minding my house!

43:46.452 --> 43:48.370
God save Your Majesty!

43:49.705 --> 43:51.540
God save Your Grace!

43:58.713 --> 44:00.465
God save the King!

44:03.259 --> 44:04.552
Lift!

44:12.560 --> 44:13.770
Drop blades!

44:16.314 --> 44:18.566
Sire! Sire! Sire!

44:50.430 --> 44:52.683
Are you coming my way, Rich?

44:54.976 --> 44:56.061
No.

44:58.063 --> 45:00.315
I think you should, you know.

45:00.774 --> 45:02.900
I can't tell you anything.

45:09.573 --> 45:10.741
Well?

45:23.421 --> 45:24.672
Thomas?

45:27.133 --> 45:28.926
Stay friends with him.

45:30.428 --> 45:34.181
Whatever may be done by smiling,
you may rely on me to do.

45:41.438 --> 45:43.606
Set your mind at rest.

45:43.898 --> 45:47.152
This is not the stuff
of which martyrs are made.

45:56.828 --> 45:59.831
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.

46:01.249 --> 46:03.209
Will wants to talk to you, Father.

46:04.711 --> 46:06.613
I told him it wouldn't be convenient.

46:06.713 --> 46:07.714
You were quite right.

46:08.506 --> 46:11.425
You're very free
with my daughter's hand, Roper.

46:11.967 --> 46:12.843
Yes.

46:13.469 --> 46:15.387
It's of that I wish to speak.

46:15.763 --> 46:18.682
Sir, you've had a disagreement
with His Majesty.

46:19.558 --> 46:21.877
- Have I?
- So Meg tells me.

46:21.977 --> 46:23.937
I offer my congratulations.

46:24.313 --> 46:27.216
If it's true,
is it a matter for congratulation?

46:27.316 --> 46:28.359
Yes!

46:31.737 --> 46:36.408
Sir, when last I asked you
for your daughter's hand...

46:36.658 --> 46:39.870
you objected to my unorthodox opinions.

46:40.412 --> 46:41.605
- I did.
- Yes.

46:41.705 --> 46:44.375
Well, since then my views
have somewhat modified.

46:48.878 --> 46:50.671
Well, that's good hearing, Will.

46:51.631 --> 46:55.326
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning
the various corruptions in the Church.

46:55.426 --> 46:58.246
- Quite right.
- But an attack upon the Church herself...

46:58.346 --> 47:00.873
no. I see behind that an attack on God.

47:00.973 --> 47:02.458
- Roper!
- The Devil's work...

47:02.558 --> 47:04.335
to be done by the Devil's ministers!

47:04.435 --> 47:06.337
For heaven's sake, remember my office.

47:06.437 --> 47:07.880
If you stand on your office...

47:07.980 --> 47:12.193
No, I don't stand on it, but there are
certain things I may not hear.

47:12.902 --> 47:13.569
Sir Thomas.

47:16.114 --> 47:17.407
Richard?

47:18.157 --> 47:19.324
I fell.

47:21.159 --> 47:22.411
Lady Alice.

47:22.744 --> 47:24.313
- Lady Margaret.
- Good evening.

47:24.413 --> 47:26.832
Do you know William Roper, the younger?

47:26.998 --> 47:28.875
By reputation, of course.

47:29.126 --> 47:31.420
- Good evening, Master...
- Rich.

47:38.927 --> 47:40.429
You've heard of me?

47:40.679 --> 47:41.805
Yes.

47:42.139 --> 47:45.559
In what connection?
I don't know what you can have heard.

47:51.440 --> 47:53.608
I sense that I'm not welcome here.

47:53.858 --> 47:56.928
Why Richard? Have you done something
to make you not welcome?

47:57.028 --> 47:58.387
Cromwell is asking questions.

47:58.487 --> 48:01.907
About you. He's always asking
questions about you and your opinions.

48:02.408 --> 48:03.701
Of whom?

48:04.744 --> 48:06.996
Of him, for one.
That's one of his sources.

48:08.664 --> 48:11.042
Of course. That's one of my servants.

48:12.710 --> 48:14.336
All right, Matthew.

48:19.342 --> 48:21.761
Well, you look at me
as though I were an enemy.

48:24.388 --> 48:26.349
Why Richard, you're shaking.

48:28.099 --> 48:29.392
Help me.

48:30.310 --> 48:31.311
How?

48:31.436 --> 48:32.729
Employ me.

48:33.438 --> 48:34.522
No.

48:35.065 --> 48:36.858
- Employ me!
- No.

48:52.457 --> 48:54.292
I would be faithful.

48:58.046 --> 49:02.217
You couldn't answer for yourself
even so far as tonight.

49:14.353 --> 49:15.562
Arrest him!

49:15.688 --> 49:17.172
- For what?
- He's dangerous!

49:17.272 --> 49:19.049
- Libel. He's a spy!
- That man's bad!

49:19.149 --> 49:21.343
- There's no law against that.
- God's law!

49:21.443 --> 49:24.013
- Then God can arrest him.
- While you talk, he's gone!

49:24.113 --> 49:27.141
Go he should, if he were the Devil,
until he broke the law.

49:27.241 --> 49:30.894
- Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
- Yes, what would you do?

49:30.994 --> 49:33.522
Cut a road through the law
to get after the Devil?

49:33.622 --> 49:36.583
Yes. I'd cut down every law in England
to do that.

49:37.417 --> 49:40.486
And when the last law was down,
and the Devil turned on you...

49:40.586 --> 49:43.615
where would you hide, Roper,
the laws all being flat?

49:43.715 --> 49:46.409
This country is planted with laws
from coast to coast...

49:46.509 --> 49:49.120
Man's laws, not God's,
and if you cut them down...

49:49.220 --> 49:50.955
and you're just the man to do it...

49:51.055 --> 49:55.560
do you really think you could stand
upright in the wind that would blow then?

49:56.519 --> 49:57.337
Yes.

49:57.437 --> 50:01.733
I give the Devil benefit of law
for my own safety's sake.

50:39.644 --> 50:41.396
- Master Rich?
- Yes.

50:41.521 --> 50:43.065
In there, sir.

50:49.111 --> 50:51.155
Rich? Come in.

50:55.201 --> 50:57.311
Taken you long enough to get here.

50:57.411 --> 50:59.121
Have I kept you waiting?

51:00.331 --> 51:01.582
Months.

51:03.959 --> 51:06.170
- Here.
- Thank you.

51:07.588 --> 51:09.131
Do you know the news?

51:09.465 --> 51:12.593
- What news?
- Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.

51:14.136 --> 51:16.222
And I succeed him.

51:17.431 --> 51:19.166
Secretary to the Council?

51:19.266 --> 51:20.392
You?

51:20.934 --> 51:22.644
'Tis surprising, isn't it?

51:24.020 --> 51:26.815
I mean, one sees that's logical.

51:28.775 --> 51:31.653
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...

51:31.778 --> 51:33.863
as His Majesty would say.

51:37.325 --> 51:39.119
You see how I trust you.

51:40.078 --> 51:42.831
I'd never repeat
or report a thing like that.

51:44.124 --> 51:46.918
What kind of thing
would you repeat or report?

51:49.004 --> 51:50.797
Nothing said in friendship.

51:51.214 --> 51:52.532
Do you believe that?

51:52.632 --> 51:54.617
- Why, yes.
- No, seriously.

51:54.717 --> 51:56.093
Well, yes.

51:56.427 --> 52:00.389
Rich, seriously.

52:05.602 --> 52:08.939
That would depend what I was offered.

52:10.816 --> 52:12.426
Don't say it just to please me.

52:12.526 --> 52:15.237
It's true. It would depend
what I was offered.

52:17.322 --> 52:20.284
Well, there is another post vacant.

52:20.743 --> 52:22.953
Collector of Revenues for York.

52:23.579 --> 52:25.189
Is it in your gift?

52:25.289 --> 52:26.665
Effectively.

52:27.708 --> 52:29.500
What must I do for it?

52:31.919 --> 52:35.214
I know a man
who wants to change his woman.

52:36.841 --> 52:39.744
Normally a matter of small importance,
but in this case...

52:39.844 --> 52:43.014
it's our liege, Lord Henry,
the eighth of that name.

52:43.765 --> 52:48.127
Which is a quaint way of saying that
if he wants to change his woman, he will.

52:48.227 --> 52:50.396
And our job as administrators...

52:50.980 --> 52:55.318
is to minimize the inconvenience
which this is going to cause.

52:55.443 --> 52:59.739
That's our only job, Rich,
to minimize the inconvenience of things.

53:00.198 --> 53:03.200
A harmless occupation
you would say, but no.

53:03.450 --> 53:06.453
We administrators are not liked, Rich.

53:06.912 --> 53:08.689
We are not popular.

53:08.789 --> 53:13.001
I say "we" on the assumption you'll accept
the post at York I've offered you.

53:17.964 --> 53:19.091
Yes.

53:26.932 --> 53:30.294
It's a bad sign when people are depressed
by their own good fortune.

53:30.394 --> 53:32.421
- I'm not depressed.
- You look depressed.

53:32.521 --> 53:34.923
I was lamenting. I've lost my innocence.

53:35.023 --> 53:37.900
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?

53:39.402 --> 53:43.572
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor,
now there's an innocent man.

53:45.700 --> 53:47.576
The odd thing is, he is.

53:47.827 --> 53:50.813
Yes, I say he is. Unhappily...

53:50.913 --> 53:53.274
his innocence is tangled up
in this problem...

53:53.374 --> 53:56.110
that you can't change your woman
without a divorce...

53:56.210 --> 53:59.463
and you can't get a divorce
unless the Pope says so.

53:59.588 --> 54:04.135
And from this meaningless circumstance,
I foresee a certain measure of...

54:04.468 --> 54:06.762
- Inconvenience?
- Just so.

54:07.847 --> 54:10.599
This goblet he gave you,
how much was it worth?

54:12.517 --> 54:16.730
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?

54:17.063 --> 54:18.256
Fifty shillings.

54:18.356 --> 54:21.359
It was a gift, wasn't it,
from a litigant, a woman?

54:21.943 --> 54:23.945
- Yes.
- Which court? Chancery?

54:25.697 --> 54:27.782
Don't get drunk!

54:28.283 --> 54:30.869
Which court was the litigant's case?

54:32.787 --> 54:34.539
Court of Requests.

54:36.624 --> 54:39.377
There. That wasn't too painful, was it?

54:42.005 --> 54:43.423
- No.
- No.

54:43.548 --> 54:46.175
And you'll find it easier, next time.

55:21.584 --> 55:24.420
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...

55:24.796 --> 55:27.173
Reverend Doctors of the Church.

55:27.382 --> 55:30.285
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...

55:30.385 --> 55:32.829
to his trusty well-beloved subjects...

55:32.929 --> 55:35.682
pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.

55:37.392 --> 55:38.685
"His Majesty...

55:38.810 --> 55:42.772
"acknowledges your humble
admission of many grievous errors...

55:43.940 --> 55:45.383
"for which he accepts...

55:45.483 --> 55:50.154
"the manumission
of £100,000 in token.

55:52.657 --> 55:56.476
"Mindful for the well-being of the realm
and the quietness of his subjects...

55:56.576 --> 56:00.981
"His Majesty requires that you do now
straightly renounce your pretended...

56:01.081 --> 56:03.500
"allegiance to the See of Rome.

56:04.042 --> 56:07.212
"And admit the statute
passed through parliament...

56:07.546 --> 56:10.090
"acknowledging
the King's good title...

56:10.674 --> 56:13.468
"Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

56:19.099 --> 56:22.060
Well, my lords, what's your answer?

56:24.021 --> 56:26.398
Yea or nay?

56:28.691 --> 56:31.235
His Majesty accepts your resignation
very sadly.

56:31.610 --> 56:33.971
He's mindful of your goodness
and past loyalty.

56:34.071 --> 56:38.576
And in any matter concerning your honor
and welfare he'll continue your good lord.

56:39.952 --> 56:42.204
You will convey my humble gratitude.

56:48.461 --> 56:50.880
- Help me with this.
- Not I.

56:54.425 --> 56:56.302
- Alice?
- No.

56:57.261 --> 57:02.016
Sun and moon, Master More, you're taken
for a wise man. Is this wisdom?

57:02.308 --> 57:04.000
To betray your ability...

57:04.100 --> 57:07.771
abandon your station
and forget your duty to your kith and kin?

57:08.480 --> 57:10.148
Shall I, sir?

57:11.816 --> 57:14.444
No, thank you, son Roper.

57:16.279 --> 57:17.447
Margaret...

57:18.740 --> 57:20.116
will you?

57:21.451 --> 57:22.702
Yes.

57:27.832 --> 57:29.751
If you want.

57:34.881 --> 57:36.758
There's my clever girl.

57:40.135 --> 57:44.556
Well done, sir! In my opinion,
that thing's a degradation.

57:44.682 --> 57:47.251
I'll tell you my opinion
of the King's title, too...

57:47.351 --> 57:51.230
Don't! Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...

57:52.106 --> 57:53.857
and may have children.

58:05.703 --> 58:07.771
All right, Thomas, make me understand...

58:07.871 --> 58:10.649
because I tell you,
to me this looks like cowardice!

58:10.749 --> 58:11.708
All right, I will.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.545
This isn't reformation,
this is war against the Church.

58:15.753 --> 58:19.407
Our King has declared war on the Pope
because the Pope will not declare...

58:19.507 --> 58:22.385
- ... that our Queen is not his wife.
- And is she?

58:25.471 --> 58:26.806
Is she?

58:29.308 --> 58:32.211
Have I your word that what we say here
is between us two?

58:32.311 --> 58:33.521
Very well.

58:33.646 --> 58:37.191
And if the King should command you
to repeat what I may say?

58:37.317 --> 58:39.277
I should keep my word to you.

58:39.402 --> 58:43.239
Then what has become of your oath
of obedience to the King?

58:45.949 --> 58:47.768
You lay traps for me!

58:47.868 --> 58:50.495
No, I show you the times.

58:53.790 --> 58:57.653
We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope's a prince, isn't he?

58:57.753 --> 59:01.782
He is. He's also the descendant
of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.

59:01.882 --> 59:05.744
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...

59:05.844 --> 59:08.789
which includes the respect
of your country, for a belief?

59:08.889 --> 59:12.184
Because what matters
is that I believe it, or rather, no...

59:12.768 --> 59:15.937
not that I believe it,
but that I believe it.

59:16.730 --> 59:20.108
- I trust I make myself obscure?
- Perfectly.

59:22.860 --> 59:26.697
Why do you insult me
with this lawyer's chatter?

59:27.406 --> 59:29.325
Because I'm afraid.

59:29.492 --> 59:31.118
Man, you're ill.

59:33.913 --> 59:36.540
This isn't Spain, you know.
This is England.

59:55.975 --> 01:00:00.021
My friends, you all know
why I've called you here.

01:00:00.772 --> 01:00:04.192
I have today resigned my office.

01:00:06.653 --> 01:00:09.656
I am no longer a great man.

01:00:10.865 --> 01:00:14.160
Sir, we want you to know
that we're all on your side.

01:00:14.995 --> 01:00:17.455
My side? What side is that?

01:00:17.831 --> 01:00:19.733
Well, sir, we all know what you think.

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:22.319
None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess...

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:25.463
and babble it about,
you do me no good service.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:31.118
Since I am no more a great man,
I no longer need a great household.

01:00:31.218 --> 01:00:36.015
Nor can I afford one.
You will have to go.

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:39.460
However, I still number some great men
among my friends...

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.837
and they still need great households.

01:00:41.937 --> 01:00:45.341
No one will be turned away
until we've found another place for him.

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.360
- We can't find places for them all.
- Yes, we can.

01:00:50.571 --> 01:00:52.072
Thank you.

01:00:53.365 --> 01:00:54.867
That is all.

01:01:05.585 --> 01:01:07.253
What about you, Matthew?

01:01:10.923 --> 01:01:12.467
Will you stay?

01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:14.535
Well, sir, that's according.

01:01:14.635 --> 01:01:17.430
There will be more work and less money.

01:01:18.765 --> 01:01:22.794
Well then, I don't see how I can then, sir.
After all, I've got my own...

01:01:22.894 --> 01:01:26.856
Quite right, Matthew. Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.

01:01:27.982 --> 01:01:30.777
Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.

01:01:35.448 --> 01:01:37.158
I shall miss you.

01:01:48.752 --> 01:01:51.046
Damn me! Isn't that them all over!

01:01:51.505 --> 01:01:53.865
Miss me? What's in me for him to miss?

01:01:53.965 --> 01:01:58.287
"Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.

01:01:58.387 --> 01:02:03.308
And that's it. And that's all of it! All right,
so he's down on his luck, I'm sorry.

01:02:04.101 --> 01:02:06.353
I don't mind saying
that I'm sorry, bad luck.

01:02:06.645 --> 01:02:08.797
If I had good luck to spare
he could have some!

01:02:08.897 --> 01:02:10.883
I wish we could have good luck
all the time.

01:02:10.983 --> 01:02:15.611
I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings! But we don't.

01:02:26.747 --> 01:02:29.125
Well, there's an end of you.

01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:32.028
What'll you do now? Sit by the fire...

01:02:32.128 --> 01:02:34.280
and make goslings in the ash?

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.424
Not at all, Alice.

01:02:37.299 --> 01:02:39.719
I expect I'll write a bit...

01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:42.263
I'll write...

01:02:43.139 --> 01:02:45.308
I'll read, I'll think.

01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:48.768
I think I'll learn to fish.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.482
I'll play with my grandchildren
when son Roper's done his duty.

01:02:56.234 --> 01:02:59.654
- Alice, shall I teach you to read?
- No, by God!

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:06.019
Poor, silly man, you think
they'll leave you here to think?

01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:08.580
If we govern our tongues, they will!

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:16.796
I have a word to say on that. I've made
no statement. I've resigned, that's all.

01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:22.076
The King is made, by act of parliament,
Supreme Head of the Church in England.

01:03:22.176 --> 01:03:26.455
This English Church will divorce him from
the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.

01:03:26.555 --> 01:03:30.434
But on any of these matters,
have you heard me make a statement?

01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:31.602
No.

01:03:31.894 --> 01:03:35.673
If I'm to lose my rank and fall to
housekeeping, I want to know the reason.

01:03:35.773 --> 01:03:37.800
- So make a statement now.
- No.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.886
Alice, it's a point of law.
Accept it from me...

01:03:40.986 --> 01:03:43.889
that in silence is my safety,
under the law.

01:03:43.989 --> 01:03:47.643
And my silence must be absolute,
it must extend to you.

01:03:47.743 --> 01:03:49.870
In short, you don't trust me.

01:03:53.582 --> 01:03:57.543
I'm the Lord Chief Justice,
I'm Cromwell, I'm the keeper of the Tower.

01:03:57.877 --> 01:03:59.237
I take your hand...

01:03:59.337 --> 01:04:03.199
I clamp it on the Bible,
on the blessed Cross and I say:

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:06.678
"Woman, has your husband
made a statement on these matters?

01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:10.723
"On peril of your soul remember,
what is your answer?"

01:04:12.809 --> 01:04:13.893
No.

01:04:15.144 --> 01:04:17.939
And so it must remain.

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:29.408
Have you opened your mind to Meg?

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.661
Would I tell Meg what I won't tell you?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.748
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.637
This is a dangerous matter then...

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:53.390
if you've not told Meg.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.019
I don't think so. No.

01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:00.480
When they find I'm silent...

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:04.400
they'll want nothing better
than to leave me silent.

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:07.194
You'll see.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:32.720
But he's silent, Master Secretary,
why not leave him silent?

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.931
Your Grace, not being
a man of letters...

01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:39.376
you perhaps don't realize
the extent of his reputation.

01:05:39.476 --> 01:05:42.420
This silence of his
is bellowing up and down Europe!

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.714
In Europe he is claimed
as the King's enemy.

01:05:44.814 --> 01:05:47.259
Rubbish! Crank he may be,
traitor he is not.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:49.778
Exactly. And with a little pressure...

01:05:50.779 --> 01:05:52.973
With a little pressure
he can be got to say so.

01:05:53.073 --> 01:05:55.809
That's all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...

01:05:55.909 --> 01:05:59.829
- ... to the present administration.
- I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.

01:06:00.705 --> 01:06:02.999
The King does not agree with you.

01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:12.174
What kind of pressure do you think
you can bring to bear?

01:06:12.841 --> 01:06:16.787
I have evidence that Sir Thomas,
while he was a judge, accepted bribes.

01:06:16.887 --> 01:06:18.305
What?

01:06:18.597 --> 01:06:22.501
Goddammit! He was the only judge
since Cato who didn't accept bribes!

01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:25.880
When was there a chancellor
whose possessions, after three years...

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.816
totaled £100 and a gold chain?

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.139
It is, as you imply, common practice...

01:06:35.239 --> 01:06:38.267
but a practice may be common
and remain an offence.

01:06:38.367 --> 01:06:40.953
This offence could send a man
to the Tower.

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:47.417
Come here.

01:06:48.418 --> 01:06:51.738
This woman's name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.

01:06:51.838 --> 01:06:53.948
- She entered a case...
- A property case it was.

01:06:54.048 --> 01:06:55.508
Shut your mouth.

01:06:56.426 --> 01:06:59.120
A property case in the Court of Requests
in April, 1528.

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.747
And got a wicked false judgment!

01:07:00.847 --> 01:07:03.666
And got an impeccably correct judgment
from Sir Thomas.

01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:05.835
- No, sir, it was not!
- Tell the gentleman...

01:07:05.935 --> 01:07:08.646
about the gift you gave the judge.

01:07:09.772 --> 01:07:11.482
I gave him a cup, sir.

01:07:11.607 --> 01:07:15.053
A silver Italian cup I bought in Leicester,
for 100 shillings.

01:07:15.153 --> 01:07:17.155
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?

01:07:17.405 --> 01:07:18.598
Yes, sir, he did.

01:07:18.698 --> 01:07:22.159
He did accept it. We can corroborate that.
You can go.

01:07:22.492 --> 01:07:24.411
- To my way of thinking...
- Go!

01:07:33.337 --> 01:07:36.006
- Is that your witness?
- No.

01:07:36.798 --> 01:07:41.553
By an odd coincidence that cup later
came into the hands of Master Rich here.

01:07:43.347 --> 01:07:44.473
How?

01:07:47.392 --> 01:07:50.479
- He gave it to me, Your Grace.
- Gave it to you? Why?

01:07:50.896 --> 01:07:52.147
A gift.

01:07:53.148 --> 01:07:56.275
Yes, you were a friend, weren't you?

01:07:56.901 --> 01:07:59.153
When did Thomas give you this thing?

01:07:59.987 --> 01:08:01.864
I can't exactly remember.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:07.119
Do you "remember" what you did with it?

01:08:07.536 --> 01:08:09.330
- I sold it.
- Where?

01:08:09.997 --> 01:08:12.208
- A shop.
- Has the shop still got it?

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:15.461
No. They've lost all track of it.

01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:17.171
How convenient.

01:08:19.298 --> 01:08:21.408
You doubt Master Rich's word,
Your Grace?

01:08:21.509 --> 01:08:23.844
It had occurred to me.

01:08:26.889 --> 01:08:28.975
This is the bill of sale.

01:08:39.776 --> 01:08:44.572
That cow put her case into court in April,
you said. This is dated May.

01:08:45.698 --> 01:08:48.643
In other words, the moment Thomas knew
the cup was a bribe...

01:08:48.743 --> 01:08:52.162
he dropped it into the nearest gutter.

01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:58.044
The facts will bear that interpretation,
I suppose.

01:08:59.296 --> 01:09:02.032
This is a horse that won't run,
Master Secretary.

01:09:02.131 --> 01:09:04.908
Just a trial gallop.
We'll find something better.

01:09:05.009 --> 01:09:07.594
- I want no part of it.
- You have no choice.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:11.223
What's that you say?

01:09:12.683 --> 01:09:17.104
The King particularly wishes you
to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.

01:09:17.563 --> 01:09:19.089
He's not told me that.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:21.108
Indeed? He told me.

01:09:25.237 --> 01:09:26.863
Look here, Cromwell...

01:09:27.156 --> 01:09:29.325
what's the purpose of all this?

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.993
There you have me.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.621
It's a matter of conscience, I think.

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:38.332
The King wants Sir Thomas
to bless his marriage.

01:09:38.791 --> 01:09:43.296
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding
now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.259
He won't attend the wedding.

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:50.886
If I were you, I'd try and persuade him.

01:09:51.511 --> 01:09:54.682
I really would try, if I were you.

01:09:57.185 --> 01:10:00.188
Cromwell, are you threatening me?

01:10:00.313 --> 01:10:03.650
My dear Norfolk, this isn't Spain.

01:10:04.525 --> 01:10:06.194
This is England!

01:12:22.576 --> 01:12:25.079
Thomas? Thomas!

01:13:31.018 --> 01:13:32.127
Lady Margaret?

01:13:32.227 --> 01:13:33.103
Yes.

01:13:35.397 --> 01:13:38.899
We've been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.

01:13:41.152 --> 01:13:45.489
I have a letter for your father,
Lady Margaret. From Hampton Court.

01:13:48.909 --> 01:13:53.039
He's to answer certain charges
before Secretary Cromwell.

01:13:56.208 --> 01:13:58.085
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.

01:14:04.091 --> 01:14:06.619
Master Rich will make a record
of our conversation.

01:14:06.719 --> 01:14:08.746
Good of you to tell me,
Master Secretary.

01:14:08.846 --> 01:14:10.331
I think you know one another.

01:14:10.431 --> 01:14:12.766
Indeed yes, we're old friends.

01:14:13.725 --> 01:14:16.061
That's a nice gown you have, Richard.

01:14:21.232 --> 01:14:23.485
Sir Thomas, believe me.

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:27.781
No, that's asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.

01:14:28.073 --> 01:14:31.868
You have no more sincere admirer
than myself.

01:14:32.994 --> 01:14:35.372
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.

01:14:39.376 --> 01:14:41.194
If I might hear the charges.

01:14:41.294 --> 01:14:44.239
- The charges?
- I understand there are certain charges.

01:14:44.339 --> 01:14:47.950
Some ambiguities of behavior
I should like to clarify, hardly charges.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:51.720
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.974
Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.

01:14:59.979 --> 01:15:03.023
The King is not pleased with you.

01:15:03.816 --> 01:15:05.317
I am grieved.

01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:09.597
And yet, do you know that even now,
if you could bring yourself...

01:15:09.697 --> 01:15:13.309
to agree with the Church,
universities, the Lords and the Commons...

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:17.204
there is no honor which His Majesty
would be likely to deny you?

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:21.041
I am well acquainted with
His Grace's generosity.

01:15:24.127 --> 01:15:25.253
Very well.

01:15:27.714 --> 01:15:31.968
You have heard of the so-called
"Holy Maid of Kent"...

01:15:32.385 --> 01:15:34.871
who was executed for prophesying
against the King?

01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:37.140
- Yes, I met her.
- Yes, you met her.

01:15:37.307 --> 01:15:40.919
Yet you did not warn His Majesty
of her treason. How was that?

01:15:41.019 --> 01:15:44.397
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.

01:15:44.772 --> 01:15:47.759
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?

01:15:47.859 --> 01:15:51.054
- Happily, there were witnesses.
- You wrote a letter to her.

01:15:51.154 --> 01:15:56.058
Yes. I wrote, advising her to abstain
from meddling in the affairs of state.

01:15:56.158 --> 01:16:00.078
I have a copy of the letter.
Also witnessed.

01:16:02.247 --> 01:16:07.336
- You have been cautious.
- I like to keep my affairs regular.

01:16:14.426 --> 01:16:18.347
In the June of 1521,
the King published a book.

01:16:19.348 --> 01:16:20.849
A theological work.

01:16:22.351 --> 01:16:25.045
It was called,
A Defense of the Seven Sacraments.

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:30.091
For which he was named "Defender
of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.

01:16:30.191 --> 01:16:33.553
By the Bishop of Rome,
or do you insist on "pope"?

01:16:33.653 --> 01:16:37.823
No. "Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn't alter his authority.

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:44.272
Thank you. You come to the point
very readily. What is that authority?

01:16:44.372 --> 01:16:46.440
For example, in the Church of England...

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.377
what exactly is
the Bishop of Rome's authority?

01:16:50.294 --> 01:16:54.632
You will find it very ably set out
and defended, Master Secretary...

01:16:54.882 --> 01:16:56.676
in the King's book.

01:16:57.259 --> 01:17:00.580
In the book published under
the King's name, would be more accurate.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.165
- You wrote this book.
- I wrote no part of it.

01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:05.125
I don't mean you actually held the pen.

01:17:05.225 --> 01:17:08.044
I answered to my best ability,
some points of common law...

01:17:08.144 --> 01:17:10.463
which the King put to me,
as I was bound to do.

01:17:10.563 --> 01:17:12.132
Do you deny you instigated it?

01:17:12.232 --> 01:17:15.802
It was from first to last
the King's own project.

01:17:15.902 --> 01:17:17.028
The King says not.

01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:22.826
The King knows the truth of it.

01:17:23.702 --> 01:17:25.979
And whatever he may have said to you...

01:17:26.079 --> 01:17:29.291
he will not give evidence
to support this accusation.

01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:31.985
Why not?

01:17:32.085 --> 01:17:36.381
Because evidence is given on oath,
and he will not perjure himself.

01:17:36.965 --> 01:17:40.718
If you don't know that,
then you don't yet know him.

01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:47.766
Sir Thomas More.

01:17:47.933 --> 01:17:49.126
Have you anything to say...

01:17:49.226 --> 01:17:51.603
regarding the King's marriage
with Queen Anne?

01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:54.840
I understood
I was not to be asked that again.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.051
Then you understood wrongly.
These charges...

01:17:57.151 --> 01:18:01.614
They are terrors for children,
Master Secretary, not for me!

01:18:07.328 --> 01:18:10.064
Then know that the King
commands me to charge you...

01:18:10.164 --> 01:18:12.750
in his name, with great ingratitude!

01:18:13.541 --> 01:18:17.612
And to tell you that there never was,
nor could be, so villainous a servant...

01:18:17.712 --> 01:18:20.590
nor so traitorous
a subject, as yourself!

01:18:22.425 --> 01:18:23.468
So...

01:18:26.179 --> 01:18:28.473
I am brought here at last.

01:18:29.432 --> 01:18:30.475
Brought?

01:18:31.768 --> 01:18:34.437
You've brought yourself
to where you stand now.

01:18:36.689 --> 01:18:37.857
You may go.

01:18:43.404 --> 01:18:44.781
For the present.

01:18:51.203 --> 01:18:52.829
What will you do now?

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.917
Whatever's necessary.

01:19:05.884 --> 01:19:06.927
Boat!

01:19:23.818 --> 01:19:26.821
Oh, come, come,
it's not as bad as all that!

01:19:32.285 --> 01:19:33.536
Howard!

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:41.168
I can't get home.

01:19:41.919 --> 01:19:43.754
They won't bring me a boat.

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.798
Do you blame them?

01:19:45.965 --> 01:19:47.591
Is it as bad as that?

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:50.386
It's every bit as bad as that!

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:53.998
Then it's good of you
to be seen with me.

01:19:54.098 --> 01:19:55.683
I followed you.

01:19:56.808 --> 01:19:58.560
Were you followed?

01:20:09.112 --> 01:20:11.306
- You're dangerous to know!
- Then don't know me.

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.350
- I do know you.
- I mean as a friend.

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:17.495
- I am your friend. I wish I wasn't, but I am.
- What's to be done then?

01:20:17.621 --> 01:20:19.689
- Give in.
- I can't give in, Howard.

01:20:19.789 --> 01:20:22.067
Our friendship's more mutable than that.

01:20:22.167 --> 01:20:24.903
The one fixed point in the world
of turning friendship...

01:20:25.003 --> 01:20:28.740
- ... is that Sir More won't give in.
- To me it has to be, for that's myself.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.467
Affection goes as deep in me
as you, I think.

01:20:31.925 --> 01:20:36.388
But only God is love right through,
Howard, and that's my self.

01:20:37.973 --> 01:20:39.350
And who are you?

01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:43.170
A lawyer! And a lawyer's son!

01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:47.299
We're supposed to be the proud ones,
the arrogant ones, we've all given in.

01:20:47.399 --> 01:20:49.051
Why must you stand out?

01:20:49.151 --> 01:20:52.529
Goddammit man! It's disproportionate!

01:20:55.741 --> 01:20:57.326
You'll break my heart.

01:20:58.535 --> 01:21:02.414
No one is safe, Howard,
and you have a son.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:08.044
We'll end our friendship now.

01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:10.588
- For friendship's sake?
- Yes.

01:21:11.381 --> 01:21:12.298
Daft!

01:21:20.056 --> 01:21:21.975
Norfolk, you're a fool!

01:21:23.393 --> 01:21:25.837
You can't place a quarrel,
you haven't the style.

01:21:25.937 --> 01:21:29.549
Hear me out. You and your class
have given in, as you rightly call it...

01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:32.635
'cause this country's religion
means nothing to you at all.

01:21:32.735 --> 01:21:34.988
Well, that's a foolish saying
for a start!

01:21:35.947 --> 01:21:37.473
The nobility of England...

01:21:37.573 --> 01:21:41.685
The nobility of England would have
snored through the Sermon on the Mount!

01:21:41.785 --> 01:21:45.580
But you'll labor like scholars
over a bulldog's pedigree.

01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:47.941
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.

01:21:48.041 --> 01:21:51.753
We've had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.

01:21:52.045 --> 01:21:54.865
You can be cruel when you want,
but I've always known that.

01:21:54.965 --> 01:21:58.176
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?

01:22:00.178 --> 01:22:01.413
- Yes.
- It's their nature?

01:22:01.513 --> 01:22:03.290
- Yes.
- It's why you breed them?

01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:04.600
It's so with men.

01:22:05.017 --> 01:22:07.002
I will not give in, because I oppose it.

01:22:07.102 --> 01:22:12.691
Not my pride, not my spleen,
nor any other of my appetites, but I do, I.

01:22:13.566 --> 01:22:17.637
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle,
no sinew that serves no appetite...

01:22:17.737 --> 01:22:20.056
of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?
There is!

01:22:20.156 --> 01:22:22.099
- Give that some exercise, my lord!
- Thomas!

01:22:22.199 --> 01:22:25.228
As you stand you'll go before your Maker
ill conditioned!

01:22:25.328 --> 01:22:26.020
Now steady.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:31.042
And he'll think that, somewhere back along
your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!

01:22:45.431 --> 01:22:49.476
Cast in this very house
on April 3, last year...

01:22:49.851 --> 01:22:54.214
it is a matter very fit
for the Commons, gathered here...

01:22:54.314 --> 01:22:56.900
in parliament, to take in hand.

01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:01.321
Or, in consequence
of the decay of guilds...

01:23:01.613 --> 01:23:05.725
the woolen cloth, now coming out
of Yorkshire, Lincoln...

01:23:05.825 --> 01:23:09.329
and the like,
is not to blame and this...

01:23:11.456 --> 01:23:14.626
I will defer the rest
of my matter to later.

01:23:22.132 --> 01:23:26.553
That the loyal Commons, here assembled,
will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.

01:23:26.804 --> 01:23:31.225
For as much as it concerns the King's
new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.

01:23:31.517 --> 01:23:35.271
Both matters pleasing
to a loyal subject.

01:23:36.897 --> 01:23:38.649
Mark, my Masters...

01:23:38.983 --> 01:23:43.487
there is among us
a brood of discreet traitors...

01:23:43.862 --> 01:23:46.182
to which deceit
the King can brook no longer.

01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:52.329
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now
drive these subtle foxes from their covert.

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:21.966
Father?

01:24:22.066 --> 01:24:23.151
Margaret!

01:24:24.736 --> 01:24:26.446
I couldn't get a boat.

01:24:26.988 --> 01:24:28.598
What is it, Meg?

01:24:28.698 --> 01:24:31.366
Father, there's a new act
going through parliament.

01:24:33.577 --> 01:24:36.063
And by this act,
they're going to administer an oath...

01:24:36.163 --> 01:24:37.956
about the marriage.

01:24:38.624 --> 01:24:40.375
On what compulsion is the oath?

01:24:41.627 --> 01:24:43.946
- High treason.
- But what is the wording?

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:46.406
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.

01:24:46.506 --> 01:24:47.616
Tell me the words.

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:50.410
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.

01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:51.136
Take it?

01:24:51.428 --> 01:24:53.639
And if it can be taken,
you must take it, too.

01:24:54.723 --> 01:24:55.374
No!

01:24:55.474 --> 01:24:59.895
Listen, Meg. God made the angels
to show him splendor.

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:05.107
As he made animals for innocence
and plants for their simplicity.

01:25:05.232 --> 01:25:10.071
But Man he made to serve him wittily,
in the tangle of his mind.

01:25:10.529 --> 01:25:13.850
If he suffers us to come to such a case
that there is no escaping...

01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:16.769
then we may stand to our tackle
as best we can.

01:25:16.869 --> 01:25:21.916
And yes, Meg, then we can clamor like
champions, if we have the spittle for it.

01:25:22.249 --> 01:25:26.195
But it's God's part, not our own,
to bring ourselves to such a pass.

01:25:26.295 --> 01:25:29.674
Our natural business lies in escaping.

01:25:31.884 --> 01:25:33.886
If I can take this oath, I will.

01:25:38.975 --> 01:25:40.792
I would, for my sake,
you could take the oath.

01:25:40.892 --> 01:25:43.478
I never took a man into the Tower
less willingly.

01:25:43.895 --> 01:25:45.730
Thank you, Master Governor.

01:25:48.733 --> 01:25:50.110
Thank you.

01:25:52.404 --> 01:25:53.571
Sir Thomas.

01:27:27.204 --> 01:27:28.413
Sir Thomas.

01:27:31.583 --> 01:27:32.834
Sir Thomas!

01:27:53.522 --> 01:27:55.524
This is iniquitous.

01:27:59.277 --> 01:28:01.654
- Where to this time?
- Richmond Palace.

01:28:58.793 --> 01:29:00.128
Sit down.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:10.955
This is the Seventh Commission
to inquire into the case...

01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:14.041
of Sir Thomas More, appointed
by His Majesty's Council.

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:16.085
Have you anything to say?

01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:17.269
No.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:22.049
- Seen this document before?
- Many times.

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:23.759
It is the Act of Succession.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:26.345
These are the names
of those who have sworn to it.

01:29:26.445 --> 01:29:29.431
- I have, as you say, seen it before.
- Will you swear to it?

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:30.616
No.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:33.410
Thomas, we must know...

01:29:37.456 --> 01:29:41.609
We must know plainly whether you
recognize the offspring of Queen Anne...

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:43.695
as heirs to the throne.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:46.406
The King in parliament
tells me that they are.

01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:49.033
- Of course I recognize them.
- Will you swear to it?

01:29:49.133 --> 01:29:52.120
- Yes.
- Then why won't he swear to the act?

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.039
Because there is more
than that in the act.

01:29:55.139 --> 01:29:59.669
Just so. Sir Thomas, it states in the
preamble that the King's former marriage...

01:29:59.769 --> 01:30:01.754
to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...

01:30:01.854 --> 01:30:06.567
she being his brother's widow and the Pope
having no authority to sanction it.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:09.737
Is that what you deny?

01:30:15.701 --> 01:30:17.786
Is that what you dispute?

01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:27.212
Is that what you are not sure of?

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:37.873
You insult His Majesty and Council
in the person of the Lord Archbishop!

01:30:37.973 --> 01:30:39.208
I insult no one.

01:30:39.308 --> 01:30:43.186
I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.

01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:46.840
- Then your reasons must be treasonable!
- Not "must be," may be.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.633
It's a fair assumption!

01:30:48.733 --> 01:30:52.595
The law requires more than an assumption,
the law requires a fact.

01:30:52.695 --> 01:30:55.890
Of course, I cannot judge
your legal standing in the case...

01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:58.809
but until I know the ground
of your objections...

01:30:58.909 --> 01:31:02.914
I can only guess
your spiritual standing, too.

01:31:03.289 --> 01:31:07.235
If you're willing to guess that, it should be
small matter to guess my objections.

01:31:07.335 --> 01:31:09.320
Then you do have objections to the act?

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.255
Well, we know that, Cromwell!

01:31:11.464 --> 01:31:12.824
No, my lord, you don't.

01:31:12.924 --> 01:31:16.869
You may suppose I have objections,
all you know is that I will not swear to it...

01:31:16.969 --> 01:31:20.014
for which you cannot lawfully
harm me further.

01:31:20.264 --> 01:31:24.793
But if you were right in supposing me
to have objections, and right again...

01:31:24.893 --> 01:31:27.420
in supposing my objections
to be treasonable...

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.857
the law would let you cut my head off.

01:31:32.359 --> 01:31:33.985
Oh, yes.

01:31:35.153 --> 01:31:36.763
Well done, Sir Thomas.

01:31:36.863 --> 01:31:40.851
I've been trying to make that clear
to His Grace for some time.

01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:43.228
Oh, confound all this!
I'm not a scholar.

01:31:43.328 --> 01:31:45.480
I don't know if the marriage
was lawful or not...

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.666
but damn it, Thomas,
look at these names.

01:31:48.166 --> 01:31:51.628
Why can't you do as I did,
and come with us, for fellowship?

01:31:53.088 --> 01:31:56.824
And when we die, and you are sent
to heaven for doing your conscience...

01:31:56.924 --> 01:32:01.971
and I am sent to hell for not doing mine,
will you come with me, for fellowship?

01:32:03.264 --> 01:32:06.542
So, those of us whose names are there,
are damned, Sir Thomas?

01:32:06.642 --> 01:32:09.628
I have no window to look into
another man's conscience.

01:32:09.728 --> 01:32:11.005
I condemn no one.

01:32:11.105 --> 01:32:13.674
- Then the matter is capable of question?
- Certainly.

01:32:13.774 --> 01:32:17.011
But that you owe obedience to the King
is not capable of question.

01:32:17.111 --> 01:32:20.322
So weigh a doubt against a certainty
and sign.

01:32:23.284 --> 01:32:28.330
Some men think the earth is round,
others think it flat.

01:32:28.539 --> 01:32:31.082
It is a matter capable of question.

01:32:31.874 --> 01:32:36.154
But if it is flat,
will the King's command make it round?

01:32:36.254 --> 01:32:39.591
And if it is round,
will the King's command flatten it?

01:32:40.425 --> 01:32:43.303
No, I will not sign.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.123
Then you have more regard for
your own doubt than the King's command?

01:32:47.223 --> 01:32:49.501
- For myself I have no doubt.
- No doubt of what?

01:32:49.601 --> 01:32:51.878
No doubt that I will not take this oath.

01:32:51.978 --> 01:32:56.274
But why I will not, you,
Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.

01:32:56.691 --> 01:32:59.569
I might get it out of you in other ways.

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.406
You threaten like a dockside bully.

01:33:03.573 --> 01:33:04.807
How should I threaten?

01:33:04.907 --> 01:33:08.744
Like a minister of state, with justice!

01:33:09.453 --> 01:33:12.080
Justice is what you're threatened with.

01:33:12.205 --> 01:33:14.082
Then I am not threatened.

01:33:20.464 --> 01:33:22.758
Gentlemen, can't I go to bed?

01:33:22.966 --> 01:33:25.410
Aye. The prisoner may retire
as he requests.

01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:28.680
- Unless you...
- I see no purpose in prolonging this.

01:33:32.684 --> 01:33:35.812
Then, goodnight, Thomas.

01:33:40.983 --> 01:33:43.486
May I have one or two more books?

01:33:44.362 --> 01:33:45.863
Why, you have books?

01:33:46.322 --> 01:33:47.181
Yes.

01:33:47.281 --> 01:33:49.825
I didn't know, you shouldn't have.

01:33:58.084 --> 01:33:59.902
May I see my family?

01:34:00.002 --> 01:34:01.087
No.

01:34:07.551 --> 01:34:08.594
Captain!

01:34:08.886 --> 01:34:10.596
Master Secretary?

01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:15.041
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak
of the King's divorce, supremacy...

01:34:15.141 --> 01:34:17.419
- ... or the King's marriage?
- No, not a word.

01:34:17.519 --> 01:34:20.230
If he does, you will repeat it to me.

01:34:21.231 --> 01:34:22.607
Of course.

01:34:27.737 --> 01:34:28.613
Rich.

01:34:28.738 --> 01:34:29.598
Secretary?

01:34:29.698 --> 01:34:32.409
Tomorrow morning,
remove the prisoner's books.

01:34:32.576 --> 01:34:34.269
Is that necessary?

01:34:34.369 --> 01:34:37.397
With regards to this case,
the King is becoming impatient.

01:34:37.497 --> 01:34:39.357
- Aye, with you.
- With all of us.

01:34:39.457 --> 01:34:42.752
The King's impatience
will embrace a duke or two.

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:54.013
Master Secretary.

01:34:55.973 --> 01:34:58.142
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.

01:34:59.143 --> 01:35:01.186
The Attorney General for Wales.

01:35:01.437 --> 01:35:03.230
His post is vacant.

01:35:04.356 --> 01:35:06.567
You said that I might approach you.

01:35:07.735 --> 01:35:09.695
Not now, Rich.

01:35:12.781 --> 01:35:14.992
He must submit. He must!

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.202
Rack him.

01:35:21.206 --> 01:35:24.918
No. The King's conscience
will not permit it.

01:35:25.293 --> 01:35:27.670
We have to find some other way.

01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:38.389
Sir Thomas!

01:35:40.808 --> 01:35:41.626
Father!

01:35:41.726 --> 01:35:43.102
What? Margaret?

01:35:43.978 --> 01:35:45.480
Father!

01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:49.342
Meg. For God's sake,
they haven't put you in here?

01:35:49.442 --> 01:35:51.845
- No, sir, a visit.
- A brief one, Sir Thomas.

01:35:51.945 --> 01:35:53.363
Father.

01:35:54.405 --> 01:35:56.741
- Good morning, husband.
- Good morning.

01:36:00.327 --> 01:36:02.120
Good morning, Will.

01:36:07.501 --> 01:36:09.836
Well, this is a hellish place!

01:36:10.087 --> 01:36:13.115
Except it's keeping me from you,
my dears, it isn't so bad.

01:36:13.215 --> 01:36:14.950
It's remarkably like any other place.

01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:17.970
- It drips!
- Yes. It's too near the river.

01:36:29.856 --> 01:36:30.983
Well, what is it?

01:36:33.442 --> 01:36:36.988
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!

01:36:39.198 --> 01:36:41.367
Is this why they've let you come?

01:36:41.492 --> 01:36:42.535
Yes.

01:36:45.246 --> 01:36:47.498
Meg's under oath to persuade you.

01:36:49.166 --> 01:36:51.002
That was silly, Meg.

01:36:59.343 --> 01:37:01.512
How do you plan to do that?

01:37:03.556 --> 01:37:04.765
Father.

01:37:05.391 --> 01:37:08.919
"God more regards the thoughts
of the heart than the words of the mouth."

01:37:09.019 --> 01:37:11.379
- Well, so you've always told me.
- Yes.

01:37:11.479 --> 01:37:14.633
Then say the words of the oath
and in your heart think otherwise.

01:37:14.733 --> 01:37:17.986
What is an oath then,
but words we say to God?

01:37:24.659 --> 01:37:25.952
Listen, Meg.

01:37:26.745 --> 01:37:30.832
When a man takes an oath, he's holding
his own self in his own hands...

01:37:31.124 --> 01:37:32.417
like water.

01:37:32.626 --> 01:37:37.672
And if he opens his fingers then,
he needn't hope to find himself again.

01:37:38.882 --> 01:37:43.802
Some men aren't capable of this, but I'd be
loathed to think your father one of them.

01:37:46.931 --> 01:37:49.308
- I have another argument.
- Oh, Meg.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.772
In any state that was half good,
you would be raised up high, not here...

01:37:54.939 --> 01:37:57.942
- ... for what you've done already.
- All right.

01:37:58.275 --> 01:38:00.886
It's not your fault
the state's three-quarters bad.

01:38:00.986 --> 01:38:01.720
No.

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:04.431
If you elect to suffer for it,
you elect to be a hero.

01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:06.075
That's very neat.

01:38:06.575 --> 01:38:10.913
But look now. If we lived in a state
where virtue was profitable...

01:38:11.247 --> 01:38:13.524
common sense would make us saintly.

01:38:13.624 --> 01:38:18.044
But since we see that avarice, anger,
pride and stupidity...

01:38:18.294 --> 01:38:23.299
commonly profit far beyond charity,
modesty, justice and thought...

01:38:23.466 --> 01:38:26.052
perhaps we must stand fast a little...

01:38:26.219 --> 01:38:28.721
even at the risk of being heroes.

01:38:33.393 --> 01:38:34.794
But in reason!

01:38:34.894 --> 01:38:38.356
Haven't you done as much
as God can reasonably want?

01:38:43.111 --> 01:38:47.031
Well, finally it isn't
a matter of reason.

01:38:47.156 --> 01:38:49.533
Finally, it's a matter of love.

01:38:52.786 --> 01:38:55.898
You're content then to be shut up here
with mice and rats...

01:38:55.998 --> 01:38:58.275
- ... when you might be home with us?
- Content?

01:38:58.375 --> 01:39:03.589
If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be
through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.

01:39:08.218 --> 01:39:10.913
I haven't told you
what the house is like without you.

01:39:11.013 --> 01:39:12.164
Don't, Meg.

01:39:12.264 --> 01:39:15.501
- What we do in the evening without you.
- Meg, have done.

01:39:15.601 --> 01:39:17.853
We don't read because we've no candles.

01:39:18.061 --> 01:39:20.923
We don't talk because we wonder
what they're doing to you.

01:39:21.023 --> 01:39:23.716
The King is more merciful.
He doesn't use the rack.

01:39:23.816 --> 01:39:25.551
Two minutes to go, sir.

01:39:25.651 --> 01:39:28.321
- I thought you'd like to know.
- Two minutes!

01:39:28.946 --> 01:39:31.490
- Jailer!
- Sorry, sir. Two minutes.

01:39:33.284 --> 01:39:37.188
Listen, you must leave the country.
All of you must leave the country.

01:39:37.288 --> 01:39:39.273
- And leave you?
- It makes no difference.

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:41.150
They won't let me see you again.

01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:44.153
You must all go on the same day,
but not on the same boat.

01:39:44.253 --> 01:39:47.573
- Different boats from different ports.
- After the trial, then.

01:39:47.673 --> 01:39:50.259
There'll be no trial, they have no case.

01:39:51.844 --> 01:39:53.846
Do this for me, I beseech you.

01:39:53.971 --> 01:39:55.790
- Will?
- Yes, sir.

01:39:55.890 --> 01:39:57.724
- Margaret?
- Yes.

01:39:58.391 --> 01:39:59.434
Alice?

01:40:05.398 --> 01:40:08.151
- Alice, I command you!
- Right.

01:40:15.533 --> 01:40:17.535
This is splendid.

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:21.106
- I know who packed this.
- I packed it.

01:40:21.206 --> 01:40:22.249
Yes.

01:40:25.001 --> 01:40:27.571
You still make
a superlative custard, Alice.

01:40:27.671 --> 01:40:28.755
Do I?

01:40:31.299 --> 01:40:33.634
That's a nice dress you have on.

01:40:34.969 --> 01:40:36.720
Nice color anyway.

01:40:37.012 --> 01:40:39.139
My God, you think little of me!

01:40:39.723 --> 01:40:40.666
I know I'm a fool...

01:40:40.766 --> 01:40:44.003
but I'm not such a fool
as to be lamenting for my dresses...

01:40:44.103 --> 01:40:46.564
or to relish complimenting
on my custards.

01:40:46.730 --> 01:40:48.440
I'm well rebuked.

01:40:49.817 --> 01:40:51.443
- Alice...
- No!

01:40:54.613 --> 01:40:59.410
I'm sick with fear when I think
of the worst they may do to me.

01:40:59.577 --> 01:41:04.690
But worse than that will be to go
with you not understanding why I go.

01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:05.815
I don't.

01:41:05.915 --> 01:41:11.070
If you can tell me that you understand,
I might make a good death, if I have to.

01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:15.366
- Your death's no good to me.
- You must tell me that you understand.

01:41:15.466 --> 01:41:16.634
I don't!

01:41:17.010 --> 01:41:18.786
I don't believe this had to happen!

01:41:18.886 --> 01:41:21.122
If you say that
I don't see how I'm to face it.

01:41:21.222 --> 01:41:22.557
It's the truth!

01:41:22.974 --> 01:41:26.144
- You're an honest woman.
- Much good may it do me.

01:41:26.936 --> 01:41:29.130
I'll tell you what I'm afraid of...

01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:32.150
that when you've gone,
I shall hate you for it.

01:41:36.571 --> 01:41:38.281
You mustn't, Alice.

01:41:41.783 --> 01:41:43.076
You mustn't.

01:41:47.789 --> 01:41:52.127
As for understanding, I understand you're
the best man I ever met or ever likely to.

01:41:52.586 --> 01:41:57.533
And if you go, God knows why I suppose,
though as God's my witness...

01:41:57.633 --> 01:41:59.885
God's kept deadly quiet about it.

01:42:00.594 --> 01:42:04.640
And if any one wants to know
my opinion of the King and his Council...

01:42:04.765 --> 01:42:07.434
he only has to ask for it!

01:42:11.021 --> 01:42:14.358
Why, it's a lion I married.

01:42:14.607 --> 01:42:16.400
A lion. A lion.

01:42:22.323 --> 01:42:24.575
This is good.

01:42:27.286 --> 01:42:28.663
It's very good.

01:42:29.455 --> 01:42:31.165
Sorry, Sir Thomas!

01:42:31.624 --> 01:42:33.776
- Oh, for pity's sake!
- Time's up, sir.

01:42:33.876 --> 01:42:36.696
- But one more minute!
- You don't know what you're asking.

01:42:36.796 --> 01:42:38.656
- Come along, Miss.
- For heaven's sake.

01:42:38.756 --> 01:42:40.508
Now, don't do that, sir.

01:42:43.427 --> 01:42:45.763
Now, madam, don't make trouble.

01:42:48.683 --> 01:42:51.017
Come along, please, Lady Alice.

01:42:54.896 --> 01:42:57.232
Take your muddy paws off me!

01:42:57.774 --> 01:43:00.860
Filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!

01:43:01.611 --> 01:43:03.905
I'll see you suffer for this!

01:43:05.156 --> 01:43:06.408
Goodbye.

01:43:21.548 --> 01:43:23.924
You must understand my position, sir.

01:43:24.258 --> 01:43:27.887
I'm a plain, simple man
and I just want to keep out of trouble.

01:43:37.771 --> 01:43:42.401
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Savior,
clear my wits.

01:43:43.736 --> 01:43:48.032
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God,
comfort my wife and daughter...

01:43:48.991 --> 01:43:51.035
and forgive me for them.

01:44:55.514 --> 01:44:59.960
Sir Thomas More, though you have
heinously offended the King's majesty...

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:05.232
we hope that if you'll even now fore think
and repent of obstinate opinion...

01:45:05.649 --> 01:45:08.442
you may still taste his gracious pardon.

01:45:09.819 --> 01:45:11.696
My lords, I thank you.

01:45:12.446 --> 01:45:14.932
As for the matters
you may charge me with...

01:45:15.032 --> 01:45:18.811
I fear from my present weakness,
that neither my wit...

01:45:18.911 --> 01:45:21.163
nor my memory will serve...

01:45:21.789 --> 01:45:23.791
to make sufficient answer.

01:45:25.084 --> 01:45:27.378
I should be glad to sit down.

01:45:27.545 --> 01:45:29.297
A chair for the prisoner.

01:45:43.768 --> 01:45:46.004
Master Secretary Cromwell,
have you the charge?

01:45:46.104 --> 01:45:48.523
- I have, my lord.
- Then read the charge.

01:45:52.235 --> 01:45:55.514
"That you did willfully and maliciously
deny and deprive...

01:45:55.614 --> 01:45:59.451
"our liege, Lord Henry,
of his undoubted certain title...

01:45:59.701 --> 01:46:02.621
"Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

01:46:04.122 --> 01:46:07.417
But, I have never denied this title.

01:46:09.794 --> 01:46:13.632
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth,
and again at Richmond...

01:46:13.757 --> 01:46:16.258
you stubbornly refused the oath.

01:46:16.425 --> 01:46:17.743
Was this no denial?

01:46:17.843 --> 01:46:19.929
No, this was silence.

01:46:20.262 --> 01:46:23.599
And for my silence,
I am punished with imprisonment.

01:46:24.892 --> 01:46:29.104
- Why have I been called again?
- On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.

01:46:29.897 --> 01:46:32.942
For which the punishment
is not imprisonment.

01:46:33.359 --> 01:46:34.443
Death...

01:46:34.985 --> 01:46:37.363
comes for us all, my lords.

01:46:37.655 --> 01:46:39.849
Yes, even for kings he comes.

01:46:39.949 --> 01:46:43.035
The death of kings is not in question,
Sir Thomas.

01:46:43.285 --> 01:46:46.330
Nor mine, I trust,
until I'm proven guilty.

01:46:46.455 --> 01:46:49.858
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas,
as it always has!

01:46:49.958 --> 01:46:51.793
Is that so, my lord?

01:46:52.418 --> 01:46:54.170
Then I'll keep a good grip on it.

01:47:01.135 --> 01:47:02.720
So, Sir Thomas...

01:47:03.304 --> 01:47:05.348
you stand on your silence?

01:47:06.015 --> 01:47:07.183
I do.

01:47:07.934 --> 01:47:10.019
But, gentlemen of the jury...

01:47:10.812 --> 01:47:13.606
there are many kinds of silence.

01:47:14.065 --> 01:47:17.193
Consider first the silence of a man
when he is dead.

01:47:17.527 --> 01:47:20.680
Suppose we go into the room
where he is laid out and we listen.

01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:21.948
What do we hear?

01:47:23.449 --> 01:47:24.741
Silence.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:28.328
What does it betoken, this silence?

01:47:28.912 --> 01:47:31.582
Nothing. This is silence
pure and simple.

01:47:31.915 --> 01:47:33.692
But let us take another case.

01:47:33.792 --> 01:47:36.653
Suppose I were to take a dagger
from my sleeve...

01:47:36.753 --> 01:47:38.739
and make to kill the prisoner with it.

01:47:38.839 --> 01:47:43.160
And my lordships there, instead of crying
out for me to stop, maintain their silence.

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.178
That would betoken!

01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:48.807
It would betoken a willingness
that I should do it.

01:47:49.016 --> 01:47:51.935
And under the law,
they would be guilty with me.

01:47:52.895 --> 01:47:56.607
So silence can,
according to the circumstances...

01:47:57.524 --> 01:47:58.649
speak.

01:47:59.317 --> 01:48:03.696
Let us consider now the circumstances
of the prisoner's silence.

01:48:04.322 --> 01:48:08.100
The oath was put to loyal subjects
all over the country who all declared...

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.353
His Grace's title to be just and good!

01:48:10.453 --> 01:48:13.539
But when it came to the prisoner,
he refused!

01:48:15.458 --> 01:48:17.793
He calls this "silence."

01:48:18.961 --> 01:48:21.714
Yet, is there a man in this court...

01:48:22.506 --> 01:48:25.468
Is there a man in this country...

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.014
who does not know
Sir Thomas More's opinion of this title?

01:48:32.682 --> 01:48:34.517
Yet, how can this be?

01:48:34.893 --> 01:48:37.854
Because this silence betokened...

01:48:38.355 --> 01:48:43.276
nay, this silence was not silence at all,
but most eloquent denial!

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:47.072
Not so.

01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:50.742
Not so, Master Secretary.

01:48:53.536 --> 01:48:56.857
The maxim of the law is,
"Silence gives consent."

01:48:56.957 --> 01:49:00.068
If, therefore, you wish to construe
what my silence betokened...

01:49:00.168 --> 01:49:04.381
you must construe that I consented,
not that I denied.

01:49:05.674 --> 01:49:08.492
Is that in fact what the world
construes from it?

01:49:08.592 --> 01:49:11.871
Do you pretend that is what you wish
the world to construe from it?

01:49:11.971 --> 01:49:15.266
The world must construe
according to its wits.

01:49:15.432 --> 01:49:18.686
This court must construe
according to the law.

01:49:28.237 --> 01:49:31.198
My lords, I wish to call
Sir Richard Rich!

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:35.619
Richard Rich, come into court.

01:49:35.911 --> 01:49:37.580
Richard Rich!

01:49:58.892 --> 01:50:02.587
"I do swear the evidence I'll give
before the court shall be the truth...

01:50:02.687 --> 01:50:05.048
"the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."

01:50:05.148 --> 01:50:06.858
"So help me God," sir.

01:50:07.275 --> 01:50:08.693
"So help me God."

01:50:11.487 --> 01:50:15.240
Now Rich, on May 12,
you were at the Tower?

01:50:15.532 --> 01:50:17.226
- I was.
- For what purpose?

01:50:17.326 --> 01:50:19.603
I was sent to carry away
the prisoner's books.

01:50:19.703 --> 01:50:21.939
- Did you talk with the prisoner?
- Yes.

01:50:22.039 --> 01:50:24.775
Did you talk of the King's supremacy
of the Church?

01:50:24.875 --> 01:50:25.918
Yes.

01:50:26.210 --> 01:50:27.836
What did you say?

01:50:28.503 --> 01:50:31.573
I said to him, "Supposing there were
an act of parliament...

01:50:31.673 --> 01:50:34.326
"to say that I, Richard Rich,
were to be king.

01:50:34.426 --> 01:50:37.346
"Would not you, Master More,
take me for king?"

01:50:37.554 --> 01:50:39.014
"That I would," he said.

01:50:42.768 --> 01:50:45.062
"For then you would be king."

01:50:47.481 --> 01:50:48.523
Yes?

01:50:49.815 --> 01:50:53.319
Then he said,
"But I will put you a higher case.

01:50:54.028 --> 01:50:59.033
"How, if there were an act of parliament,
to say that God should not be God?"

01:50:59.408 --> 01:51:02.119
- This is true and then you said...
- Silence!

01:51:02.745 --> 01:51:03.955
Continue.

01:51:06.624 --> 01:51:10.503
But then I said,
"I will put you a middle case.

01:51:11.003 --> 01:51:13.656
"Parliament has made our King
Head of the Church.

01:51:13.756 --> 01:51:15.758
"Why will you not accept him?"

01:51:19.178 --> 01:51:20.263
Well?

01:51:23.683 --> 01:51:27.477
And then he said,
"Parliament had not the power to do it."

01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:31.481
Repeat the prisoner's words.

01:51:33.275 --> 01:51:34.359
He said:

01:51:35.777 --> 01:51:38.280
"Parliament had not the competence."

01:51:40.865 --> 01:51:42.742
Or words to that effect.

01:51:43.034 --> 01:51:45.203
He denied the title!

01:51:45.537 --> 01:51:46.872
He did.

01:51:55.088 --> 01:52:00.009
In good faith, Rich, I am sorrier
for your perjury than my peril.

01:52:00.134 --> 01:52:02.761
- Do you deny this?
- Yes!

01:52:03.345 --> 01:52:06.582
You know if I were a man
who heeded not the taking of an oath...

01:52:06.682 --> 01:52:08.142
I need not be here.

01:52:08.726 --> 01:52:11.228
Now, I will take an oath.

01:52:13.063 --> 01:52:15.941
If what Master Rich has said is true...

01:52:16.358 --> 01:52:20.321
I pray I may never see God in the face.

01:52:21.363 --> 01:52:25.075
Which I would not say, were it otherwise,
for anything on earth!

01:52:25.201 --> 01:52:27.912
- That is not evidence.
- Is it probable...

01:52:28.704 --> 01:52:33.274
Is it probable
that after so long a silence on this...

01:52:33.374 --> 01:52:35.944
the very point
so urgently sought of me...

01:52:36.044 --> 01:52:39.839
I should open my mind
to such a man as that?

01:52:41.424 --> 01:52:44.802
Sir Richard, do you wish
to modify your testimony?

01:52:45.929 --> 01:52:47.038
No, my lord.

01:52:47.138 --> 01:52:49.749
Is there anything you wish
to take away from it?

01:52:49.849 --> 01:52:50.959
No, my lord.

01:52:51.059 --> 01:52:52.936
Have you anything to add?

01:52:53.228 --> 01:52:54.520
No, my lord.

01:52:55.813 --> 01:52:59.067
- Have you, Sir Thomas?
- To what purpose?

01:53:03.029 --> 01:53:04.697
I am a dead man.

01:53:08.408 --> 01:53:10.327
You have your will of me.

01:53:11.453 --> 01:53:13.789
Then the witness may withdraw.

01:53:21.129 --> 01:53:24.341
There is one question
I would like to ask the witness.

01:53:26.885 --> 01:53:30.097
That's a chain of office you're wearing.
May I see it?

01:53:38.146 --> 01:53:39.523
The Red Dragon.

01:53:39.856 --> 01:53:41.048
What's this?

01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:44.277
Sir Richard is appointed
Attorney General for Wales.

01:53:44.485 --> 01:53:45.820
For Wales.

01:53:47.363 --> 01:53:52.535
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing
to give his soul for the whole world.

01:53:54.412 --> 01:53:55.913
But for Wales.

01:54:04.297 --> 01:54:05.798
My lords! I've done.

01:54:06.883 --> 01:54:09.510
The jury will retire
and consider the evidence.

01:54:11.596 --> 01:54:16.182
Considering the evidence, it shouldn't
be necessary for them to retire.

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:20.353
Is it necessary?

01:54:27.152 --> 01:54:29.905
Then is the prisoner
guilty or not guilty?

01:54:35.076 --> 01:54:36.745
Guilty, my lord!

01:54:47.255 --> 01:54:51.050
Sir Thomas More, you have been
found guilty of high treason.

01:54:51.175 --> 01:54:53.636
- The sentence of the court...
- My lords!

01:54:54.428 --> 01:54:58.390
When I was practicing the law,
the manner was to ask the prisoner...

01:54:58.515 --> 01:55:02.436
before pronouncing sentence,
if he had anything to say.

01:55:02.811 --> 01:55:04.605
Have you anything to say?

01:55:05.272 --> 01:55:06.315
Yes.

01:55:17.451 --> 01:55:20.538
Since the court has determined
to condemn me...

01:55:21.664 --> 01:55:23.415
God knoweth how...

01:55:24.499 --> 01:55:27.794
I will now discharge my mind...

01:55:28.378 --> 01:55:32.715
concerning the indictment
and the King's title.

01:55:36.261 --> 01:55:40.765
The indictment is grounded
in an act of parliament...

01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:43.960
which is directly repugnant...

01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:47.730
to the law of God and His Holy Church.

01:55:47.897 --> 01:55:52.135
The supreme government of which
no temper able person...

01:55:52.235 --> 01:55:56.406
may by any law presume to take upon him.

01:55:57.282 --> 01:55:58.991
This was granted...

01:55:59.741 --> 01:56:01.243
by the mouth...

01:56:01.994 --> 01:56:04.538
of our Savior, Christ Himself...

01:56:05.414 --> 01:56:09.960
to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome
whilst He lived...

01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:13.964
and was personally present...

01:56:16.383 --> 01:56:18.010
here on earth.

01:56:20.262 --> 01:56:24.099
It is therefore insufficient in law...

01:56:24.725 --> 01:56:27.686
to charge any Christian to obey it.

01:56:29.146 --> 01:56:30.631
And more than this...

01:56:30.731 --> 01:56:35.568
the immunity of the Church is promised
both in Magna Carta...

01:56:35.693 --> 01:56:39.280
and in the King's own coronation oath.

01:56:41.115 --> 01:56:43.743
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!

01:56:44.243 --> 01:56:45.494
Not so.

01:56:47.914 --> 01:56:49.999
I am the King's true subject...

01:56:50.875 --> 01:56:54.503
and I pray for him and all the realm.

01:56:56.297 --> 01:56:57.882
I do none harm.

01:56:59.050 --> 01:57:00.927
I say none harm.

01:57:01.928 --> 01:57:04.222
I think none harm.

01:57:06.307 --> 01:57:09.351
And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive...

01:57:09.768 --> 01:57:13.355
then in good faith, I long not to live.

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.733
Nevertheless...

01:57:17.692 --> 01:57:22.264
it is not for the supremacy
that you have sought my blood...

01:57:22.364 --> 01:57:26.576
but because I would not bend
to the marriage!

01:57:35.001 --> 01:57:38.129
You have been found guilty
of high treason.

01:57:38.964 --> 01:57:42.007
The sentence of the court
is that you be taken...

01:57:42.132 --> 01:57:44.051
to the Tower of London...

01:57:46.178 --> 01:57:49.515
until the day hence
to the appointment...

01:57:50.516 --> 01:57:52.601
for your execution!

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.453
I am commanded
by the King to be brief...

01:58:12.204 --> 01:58:15.124
and since I am
the King's obedient subject...

01:58:15.665 --> 01:58:17.208
brief I will be.

01:58:18.710 --> 01:58:21.963
I die His Majesty's good servant...

01:58:22.964 --> 01:58:24.549
but God's first.

01:58:31.389 --> 01:58:33.683
I forgive you, right readily.

01:58:39.731 --> 01:58:42.025
Be not afraid of your office.

01:58:42.442 --> 01:58:44.152
You send me to God.

01:58:46.613 --> 01:58:48.556
You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?

01:58:48.656 --> 01:58:51.992
He will not refuse one who is so blithe
to go to him.

01:59:14.765 --> 01:59:18.210
Thomas More's head was stuck
on Traitor's Gate for a month.

01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:22.189
Then his daughter, Margaret,
removed it and kept it 'til her death.

01:59:22.981 --> 01:59:26.901
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason
five years after More.

01:59:27.401 --> 01:59:30.071
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:33.850
The Duke of Norfolk should have
been executed for high treason...

01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:36.953
but the King died of syphilis
the night before.

01:59:37.912 --> 01:59:40.831
Richard Rich became
Chancellor of England...

01:59:41.457 --> 01:59:43.292
and died in his bed.
