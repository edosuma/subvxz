-LEXIE: Oh.
-I don't know what
I'm supposed to be doing.

00:21.774 --> 00:24.652
Well, the first thing
you have to do
is check the pressure.

00:36.205 --> 00:37.457
Stop it!

00:39.250 --> 00:42.420
-Do you hear me,
Donald MacDonald?
-Yes.

00:42.503 --> 00:44.213
If you want me
to fix this thing,

00:44.297 --> 00:46.841
you have to stop acting
like a spoiled old fool.

00:50.011 --> 00:51.471
There you go.

00:53.431 --> 00:55.933
You're going to have to learn
to do this on your own,
you know.

00:58.019 --> 00:59.145
You're going, then?

01:01.439 --> 01:02.940
I think I'd better, don't you?

01:45.817 --> 01:46.859
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

01:46.943 --> 01:48.778
It wasn't until he got back,

01:48.861 --> 01:51.656
that Hamish realised
how much he'd missed home,

01:51.738 --> 01:54.701
the mountains
and the lochs
and the heather.

01:56.619 --> 01:58.246
The city's all right
for city folk,

01:58.329 --> 02:01.082
but, well, Hamish was
from the Highlands,

02:01.165 --> 02:03.001
where the really great men
come from.

02:03.084 --> 02:05.420
-And women.
-Aye, and women.

02:05.503 --> 02:08.256
-Great women.
-Aye, definitely.

02:09.215 --> 02:11.258
There was Scary Mary, for one.

02:13.761 --> 02:15.096
She was my old teacher.

02:16.472 --> 02:17.473
Hello, Duncan.

02:19.392 --> 02:20.476
Hello, Mrs Sc...

(LAUGHING)

02:23.771 --> 02:24.814
Mrs Carey.

02:26.441 --> 02:29.527
Rob Roy has gone global,
baby, yeah.

02:32.655 --> 02:33.740
Mum?

02:37.910 --> 02:39.829
-What do you think?
-It's a pigsty.

02:42.915 --> 02:44.125
Don't mind me, Ewan.

02:45.251 --> 02:47.503
Not that anyone does any more.

02:47.587 --> 02:49.630
I never see you.
You never phone.

02:58.973 --> 03:01.100
-What's this?
-Washing.

03:01.184 --> 03:03.770
-Haven't you got
a laundry basket?
-No.

03:04.979 --> 03:06.606
You never even invited me
up here.

03:07.482 --> 03:10.068
I was gonnae. Honest!

03:11.444 --> 03:12.612
Maybe.

03:15.281 --> 03:19.702
Anyway, as it's my first visit
to your new home, Ewan,

03:19.786 --> 03:21.079
I thought
I'd bring you a present.

03:28.711 --> 03:30.296
Scary Mary, indeed!

03:31.923 --> 03:34.258
So, are you
still teaching here?

03:34.342 --> 03:36.761
-I retired last term.
-That's great.

03:36.844 --> 03:39.013
Oh, I'm not so sure.

03:39.097 --> 03:42.475
Anyway, I heard you'd been
invited to give the children
a talk about your job,

03:42.558 --> 03:45.395
so I dropped by
and listened in.
I hope you didn't mind.

03:45.478 --> 03:47.605
Oh, no, miss.
What did you think?

03:47.689 --> 03:49.232
I was impressed,

03:49.315 --> 03:51.818
but I always did say you had
a way with words, Duncan.

03:53.903 --> 03:56.531
I hear wee Ewan's
doing very well
with his radio station.

03:56.614 --> 03:59.075
Oh, yeah.
Did you teach him, too?

03:59.158 --> 04:00.284
I did.

04:00.368 --> 04:02.328
He was a pale
and scrawny wee thing,

04:02.412 --> 04:04.997
which was a pity
because he wanted
to fight everyone.

04:05.081 --> 04:06.708
He was from Glasgow, you see.

04:06.791 --> 04:08.167
And did he...

04:08.251 --> 04:10.378
Did he have a way with words,
too, Mrs Carey?

04:10.461 --> 04:14.424
He did, but I'm not sure
they were the sort of words
you wanted to hear too often.

04:15.383 --> 04:17.593
(EXHALES)

04:17.677 --> 04:21.555
-Do you remember what I put
in your last school report?
-Oh, no.

04:21.639 --> 04:24.474
"Duncan will take the world
by the scruff of the neck."

04:27.186 --> 04:29.563
Well, there's still time,
Mrs Carey.

04:29.647 --> 04:31.315
For you and me both, Duncan.

-Duck!

-Aye, it's old dirt.

Talking taps.
They're trying
to drive me mad.

04:49.751 --> 04:53.171
Ah! Should you be
thinking of running
your underused duster

04:53.254 --> 04:55.298
around my room, dear lady,

04:55.380 --> 04:57.884
now is as good a time as any.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.844
And who exactly do you think
you're talking to?

04:59.927 --> 05:02.347
No time for introductions,
I'm afraid.

05:02.430 --> 05:03.765
I have a boat to catch.

05:05.141 --> 05:07.977

in the pipes.

ROS: Stop. Turn around.

06:18.715 --> 06:19.799
Now open your eyes.

06:22.176 --> 06:23.469
It's got a year's MOT

06:24.721 --> 06:26.556
and I've taxed and
insured it for you.

06:30.518 --> 06:31.728
Thanks.

He'll have no excuses
not to come and see me now.

06:40.611 --> 06:42.697
-Will you, Ewan?
-No, Mum.

06:43.489 --> 06:45.700
Very nice.

06:45.783 --> 06:48.494
Maybe you could take me out
for a wee drive later on, eh?

06:48.578 --> 06:51.664
He won't be doing anything
or going anywhere
until he's tidied his room.

06:51.748 --> 06:53.624
-Are you, Ewan?
-No.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.835
Right, come on,
stand beside the car.

07:01.548 --> 07:03.301
So, you're still here,
then, Lexie?

07:04.052 --> 07:05.845
Yeah. Yeah, for now.

07:21.944 --> 07:23.780

07:23.863 --> 07:26.407
It has great
sentimental value.

07:26.491 --> 07:29.160
But everything has its place.

07:29.994 --> 07:31.871
People, too.

07:31.954 --> 07:36.334
-And I thought
I'd found mine here.
-But you're finally packing.

07:36.417 --> 07:39.879
Yep. I was beginning to think
you'd never leave.

07:39.962 --> 07:42.924
-Am I in the way?
-Of course not, silly.

07:45.968 --> 07:48.763
But Archie must be
missing you awfully.

07:48.846 --> 07:50.306
You must be missing
each other.

07:51.474 --> 07:52.850
You poor dears.

07:54.227 --> 07:56.437
And you mustn't worry
about Paul.

07:56.521 --> 07:58.481
-Paul?
-And the plumbing.

08:02.610 --> 08:05.530
I want a word with you.

08:05.613 --> 08:08.157
Don't you think that
antlers might look
a little out of place

08:08.241 --> 08:09.367

in Molly's secret garden

There's no denying
I'm not safe to have around.

08:35.643 --> 08:37.477
I know you'd prefer me
not to be here.

08:37.562 --> 08:39.480
Nothing would make me happier.

08:39.563 --> 08:41.399
-There's always prison.
-Prison?

08:41.482 --> 08:43.192
You should've been there
years ago.

08:43.275 --> 08:45.653
They do still send people
to prison for assault,
don't they?

08:45.737 --> 08:48.322
-I'm sure Paul could swing it.
-Aren't you being
a little hasty?

08:48.406 --> 08:50.658
All he needs to do
is inform the authorities

08:50.742 --> 08:54.578
that he can no longer
be responsible for you
or your actions.

08:54.662 --> 08:56.913

a word to me

you call them.

about land management

we replaced the old pump.

-Dad.

Duncan back?

Not exactly.

-No, thanks.

talk about it.

I think we should
forget about it.

-And pretend nothing happened?
-Yeah.

16:32.870 --> 16:34.330
-We kissed.
-So?

16:34.414 --> 16:36.040
Are you trying to tell me
it didn't mean anything?

16:37.709 --> 16:38.751
No.

forget about it.

19:11.696 --> 19:12.822

I thought that at least here
he'd keep out of trouble.

He's hurt his foot,
Mrs Brodie, nothing more.

messing about with the car,

would have happened.

-Blame the victim.
-Ewan is hardly a victim!

we were trying

is an escape route.

like his personal larder,

21:09.731 --> 21:12.316

is like a war zone.

the good bits.

to let go.

And what does that
leave me with?

that you could never do

'cause you were running about
after Ewan.

what they were.

never have left Glasgow.

my independence.

29:29.147 --> 29:30.815
-She did, yes.
-And did you hear the show?

29:30.898 --> 29:32.233
I managed to hear
a wee bit.

29:32.316 --> 29:35.111
-And what did you think?
-I'm no judge, son.

29:37.989 --> 29:40.700
What, don't give up
the day job, eh?

29:40.783 --> 29:42.660
Is that what you're thinking
of doing?

29:42.744 --> 29:45.204
(SIGHS)
No. Golly!

29:45.288 --> 29:47.373
It was just a bit of fun,
that's all.

29:48.291 --> 29:49.542
Live the dream.

29:50.710 --> 29:51.711
(SIGHS)

29:57.258 --> 29:58.634
Are you sure
you want to do this?

29:59.385 --> 30:00.470
Yes.

30:01.763 --> 30:04.474
All I have to do
is e-mail Dan the link,

30:06.809 --> 30:08.394
and I didn't even
have to talk to him.

30:36.297 --> 30:37.423
Does Molly know?

30:40.176 --> 30:41.511
PAUL: That letter
belongs to you.

30:45.723 --> 30:47.266
Molly's belongs to her.

30:47.350 --> 30:48.351
Oh, dear.

30:49.102 --> 30:50.395
Oh, dear.

30:52.105 --> 30:54.107
Well, you know this much,

30:54.190 --> 30:55.942
you might as well know
the whole story.

30:56.943 --> 30:58.361
I've made a decision, Lexie.

30:58.444 --> 31:00.071
I'm coming to New Zealand
with you.

31:00.154 --> 31:03.116
I can't live in this house
with that awful man
a moment longer.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.660
What on earth is going on?

31:07.787 --> 31:08.913
I thought you were leaving.

31:12.917 --> 31:14.043
I don't know if I can.

31:24.929 --> 31:26.347
What's this?

31:36.899 --> 31:39.402
He had a certain charm.

31:39.485 --> 31:42.739
I don't suppose
I was entirely blameless.
We none of us are, are we?

31:45.116 --> 31:48.286
When Hector rolled up
with this utterly
ravishing creature,

31:49.245 --> 31:50.371
I was smitten.

31:54.250 --> 31:57.003
It would be a lie to say
that I didn't find him

31:58.296 --> 31:59.881
a little attractive.

31:59.964 --> 32:02.508
He flattered me.

32:02.592 --> 32:05.428
Well, Hector had swept me
off my feet and
here I was, in a castle,

32:05.511 --> 32:09.474
with two dashing young men
vying for my attention.

32:09.557 --> 32:11.309
It's enough
to make anyone dizzy.

32:11.392 --> 32:13.853
The decent thing
would have been

32:13.936 --> 32:16.022
to keep my feelings
to myself and withdraw.

32:16.105 --> 32:19.817
But I loved her
beyond scruples.

32:19.901 --> 32:23.154
There wasn't anything
I wouldn't have done
to win her over.

32:23.237 --> 32:25.490
Every trick in the book,
dear boy.

32:26.741 --> 32:29.077
I even arranged an elopement.

32:31.704 --> 32:33.456
He honestly believed

32:33.539 --> 32:36.084
that when I was asked
to choose between
him and Hector,

32:36.167 --> 32:37.543
I would choose him.

32:37.627 --> 32:39.629
The arrogance of the man!

32:39.712 --> 32:42.423
Expecting me to run off
with my husband's brother.

32:47.470 --> 32:52.016
I had no idea
she'd actually turn me down.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.687
She'd play hard to get,
of course, for decency's sake.

32:55.770 --> 32:59.607
But finally she'd see sense
and we'd run away together.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.069
It was that simple.

33:03.152 --> 33:04.987
Have you ever been in love,
Paul?

33:06.489 --> 33:07.573
Yes.

33:08.658 --> 33:10.993
I left the estate AWOL,

33:11.077 --> 33:13.246
without a word
to Hector or to Molly.

33:14.247 --> 33:15.373
Hector was heartbroken.

33:16.541 --> 33:17.959
He'd lost his only brother.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.962
He adored Donald.

33:21.045 --> 33:22.922
It was the decent thing to do.

33:24.340 --> 33:25.800
No forwarding address.

33:28.761 --> 33:31.681
Probably one of the only
decent things I've ever done.

33:39.355 --> 33:42.442
I had always intended
to tell Hector the truth,

33:42.525 --> 33:45.653
but the longer I left it,
the harder it became.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.908
Did you ever think
about leaving Hector?

33:55.955 --> 33:57.749
We all harbour dark thoughts.

33:59.375 --> 34:01.377
The secret is to know them
for what they are.

34:05.089 --> 34:07.425
Molly did the right thing,
of course.

34:07.508 --> 34:10.678
We'd have been
a complete disaster together,

34:10.762 --> 34:13.139
once the adventure
had worn off.

34:19.978 --> 34:21.606
Ah-ha.

34:29.322 --> 34:30.322
(SIGHS)

34:34.369 --> 34:37.538
He may not have had the style
or panache of his brother,

34:41.376 --> 34:44.587
but I loved Hector,
for better or worse.

34:44.670 --> 34:46.339
It's easy
to forget that sometimes.

34:49.884 --> 34:51.427
Why are you telling me this,
Molly?

34:52.469 --> 34:56.766
Marriages go through phases.

34:56.849 --> 35:00.061
Hector and I
didn't always see eye to eye,
not in the early days.

35:03.314 --> 35:05.108
But what we had
was worth holding onto.

35:14.784 --> 35:15.785
(LAUGHS)

35:17.578 --> 35:19.122
Put away for a rainy day.

35:21.582 --> 35:22.834
We'll need that.

35:26.754 --> 35:28.673
I wonder when Isobel's ex
will get back to her.

35:31.718 --> 35:33.594
I could end up on Radio 1,
one day.

35:36.180 --> 35:37.432
All right, Radio 2.

35:38.516 --> 35:40.351
But I'll still need an agent.

35:40.434 --> 35:42.561
And a PA.

35:42.645 --> 35:46.273
And a PR person to look after
my personal experiences,

35:47.315 --> 35:49.527
my appearances.

35:49.610 --> 35:51.903
And we'll need
to get a little place.

35:51.987 --> 35:54.198
A nice little pomme de terre,
to begin on with.

35:55.073 --> 35:56.367
You can get a job.

35:57.493 --> 35:58.911
In land management?
(SCOFFS)

36:00.287 --> 36:02.956

they've got them.

36:03.041 --> 36:04.083
You'll be fine.

36:09.171 --> 36:10.465
This is my place.

36:11.924 --> 36:13.134
I'm not for Edinburgh.

36:18.389 --> 36:20.016
Well, what about us?

36:20.098 --> 36:23.394
-You and me, Jess?
-I can come down at weekends.

36:31.152 --> 36:33.279
Is that going to happen
to us, Jess?

36:33.363 --> 36:35.656
-You'll still go.
-Oh.

36:35.740 --> 36:37.700
Let's wait and see
what this guy says.

36:37.784 --> 36:38.826
It'll probably never happen.

36:42.580 --> 36:44.040
It has happened, Duncan.

36:58.262 --> 37:00.098
DONALD: What do you think?
EWAN: It's a wreck.

37:00.556 --> 37:02.308
Aw...

37:02.392 --> 37:05.103
It may look like that
to the untrained eye,

37:05.186 --> 37:07.647
but there's plenty of life
left in the old girl yet.

37:07.730 --> 37:10.274
-Goes like stink?
-That's the spirit.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.735
And when we get
your old banger souped up
and respectable,

37:14.445 --> 37:17.657
-I'll teach you to race, eh?
-All right.

37:17.740 --> 37:20.618
Ah! And then you and I,
dear boy,

37:20.702 --> 37:24.831
we'll restore that old Morgan
to her former glory and...

37:24.914 --> 37:27.917
I might even let you
take her for a spin.
You'll be fighting them off.

37:36.509 --> 37:37.969
-Ewan.
-Now what?

37:38.052 --> 37:39.345
Courage, dear boy.

37:39.429 --> 37:40.888
Come with me.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.267
I've decided
to clear out your room.

37:44.350 --> 37:46.144
What do you mean,
clear it out?

37:46.227 --> 37:47.854
Mr Walker moves in next week.

37:50.982 --> 37:53.359
And you might like
to address yourself

37:53.443 --> 37:54.736
by helping me clear out
my boot.

37:54.819 --> 37:56.446
Who's Mr Walker?

37:56.529 --> 37:59.240
-The lodger.
-You're moving someone
into my room?

37:59.323 --> 38:01.284
-That's right.
-I'm being kicked
out of my own home.

38:01.367 --> 38:02.785
You live here now, Ewan.

38:02.869 --> 38:05.788
This is your home,
so you'd better make
the best of it.

38:05.872 --> 38:08.833
I'm sure
this nice old gentleman
will keep you out of mischief.

38:08.916 --> 38:10.668
On the contrary, dear lady.

38:15.840 --> 38:19.093
All this radio business
of Duncan's,

38:19.177 --> 38:20.345
it's just a wee bit of fun.

(LAUGHS)

38:21.804 --> 38:22.972
Not to Duncan, it isn't.

38:25.308 --> 38:29.062
So do you think
Isobel's friend
will help him, then?

38:29.145 --> 38:31.147
Mmm-hmm, hmm. He might.

38:32.732 --> 38:34.067
You could end up losing him,

38:35.568 --> 38:37.236
unless you're thinking
of going with him.

38:38.905 --> 38:40.031
Um...

38:42.950 --> 38:44.077
I'm not.

38:44.786 --> 38:45.912
Ah, well...

38:47.622 --> 38:49.540
Let's hope
it all comes to nothing, then.

38:50.375 --> 38:51.376
How can you say that?

38:54.128 --> 38:57.048
-I just want you
to be happy, lass.
-Dad,

38:57.131 --> 38:59.384
if Duncan goes,
it will be
because he wants to.

39:01.511 --> 39:03.680
If he comes back,

39:03.763 --> 39:05.431
it'll be because
he wants to be with me.

39:07.934 --> 39:09.394
Either way, I'll be happy.

39:10.603 --> 39:11.646
You're sure about that?

39:13.564 --> 39:14.649
Yes.

39:15.775 --> 39:16.901

the right thing.

-I do.

-I'm all packed.

No.

those letters?

What if Donald hadn't tried
to steal Molly from Hector?

40:15.793 --> 40:17.795
What if Hector hadn't
been unfaithful to Molly?

40:21.382 --> 40:22.967
What if you weren't
married to Archie?

40:28.306 --> 40:29.849
I know what I know,

40:31.601 --> 40:32.602
and that'll do me.

-Right, yeah.

He thought you'd simply

with the camera you gave me.

45:37.031 --> 45:39.617
I thought you might want...

45:39.701 --> 45:42.286
I thought you might
want to keep it
to remember me by.

45:44.122 --> 45:45.331
You're not in it.

45:47.291 --> 45:49.669
No, I took it, though.

45:49.752 --> 45:53.047
(LAUGHS) I remember,
you nearly blinded me
with the flash.

45:53.131 --> 45:54.507
Happy days.

45:57.468 --> 45:59.679
-Poor Arch.
-Poor Arch...

45:59.762 --> 46:01.848
(LAUGHS)

46:01.931 --> 46:05.101
There's nothing poor
about Archie, Lex.
I mean, he's got...

46:10.815 --> 46:12.025
He's got you.

46:14.444 --> 46:15.653
He has.

46:19.407 --> 46:21.951
I'm going to see you tomorrow.

46:22.035 --> 46:24.287
You might not.
I mean, you might.

46:24.871 --> 46:26.247
Just in case.

46:30.168 --> 46:32.003
Nothing's certain
in this life, eh, Lex?

46:33.546 --> 46:34.839
I'm going to miss you.

46:37.884 --> 46:39.135
Me, too.

46:41.095 --> 46:42.388
I mean...

46:43.056 --> 46:44.682
I'll miss you,

46:45.767 --> 46:46.851
too.

46:48.353 --> 46:49.520
(LAUGHS)

47:27.934 --> 47:29.435
-Golly.
-Duncan.

47:31.104 --> 47:32.522
Off for a stroll, are you?

47:33.773 --> 47:34.941
Edinburgh.

47:45.702 --> 47:46.869
Right.

47:48.246 --> 47:49.372
Look, I'll be back.

47:50.707 --> 47:51.708
I'll miss you.

47:53.668 --> 47:55.253
Probably won't get the job,
anyway.

47:55.878 --> 47:56.879
Well,

47:58.423 --> 47:59.882
I'll shake your hand
just in case.

48:04.262 --> 48:06.889
Oh, Paul. Um, I forgot to...

48:06.973 --> 48:08.141
I'll see to it.

48:09.892 --> 48:11.227
-And Molly.
-Sure.

48:18.234 --> 48:21.070
You've been like a father
to me and Jess...

48:21.154 --> 48:23.156
Well, you are Jess's father...

48:25.575 --> 48:27.410
-You know what I mean.
-I know.

48:33.666 --> 48:35.001
I'm grateful

48:38.713 --> 48:39.922
for everything.

48:41.299 --> 48:42.300
(SNIFFS)

48:43.718 --> 48:45.428
I always will be.

48:45.511 --> 48:46.596
-(BANGS ON CAR)
-Bye.

49:09.077 --> 49:10.286
Duncan?

49:26.594 --> 49:27.720
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

49:34.560 --> 49:35.853
He didn't tell me.

49:38.314 --> 49:39.315
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

49:54.038 --> 49:55.039
(RUMBLING)

50:05.258 --> 50:06.300
Oh!

50:09.345 --> 50:11.931
Hallelujah.

50:21.232 --> 50:23.901
DUNCAN: I'll be gone
by the time you hear this,
Jess, so...

50:26.112 --> 50:28.573
I... I couldn't say
a proper goodbye,

50:28.656 --> 50:31.492
because if I'd tried,
I'd probably have stayed.

50:33.369 --> 50:35.705
You said your place
is at Glenbogle

50:35.788 --> 50:38.875
and I'm happy for you,
really I am.

50:40.293 --> 50:42.253
Maybe it's my place too,
but...

50:43.796 --> 50:46.174
I need to know for sure.

50:46.257 --> 50:48.676
And if I do come back,
then...

50:48.760 --> 50:51.304
Well, then I'll never need
to leave again.

50:52.805 --> 50:53.973
So...

50:56.851 --> 50:58.144
Goodbye, Jess.

50:59.771 --> 51:01.189
I'll never forget you.

51:07.862 --> 51:10.948
-I'm going to miss my train.
-Lexie, there's time.
Not to worry.

51:20.375 --> 51:21.668
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

51:21.751 --> 51:23.044
(GASPS)

51:23.127 --> 51:24.504
"Old steam trains.

51:26.422 --> 51:27.840
"Doing the right thing."

51:27.924 --> 51:29.634
And a tear or two.

51:39.852 --> 51:41.396
Goodbye, Lexie MacDonald.
