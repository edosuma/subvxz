00:02.013 --> 00:03.276
Good morning, Daddy.

00:03.348 --> 00:04.747
Morning, sweetheart.

00:04.816 --> 00:07.444
Look, I was thinking, you know,
this week, maybe we could...

00:07.519 --> 00:10.613
get in a game of tennis at the club
and maybe do lunch?

00:10.689 --> 00:12.281
- Y ou and me?
- Y eah.

00:12.991 --> 00:14.583
Good one, Daddy.

00:18.130 --> 00:19.529
Hi, kids.

00:20.599 --> 00:22.328
Needy father alert.

00:22.401 --> 00:24.528
Hold it.
Now, what is that supposed to mean?

00:24.603 --> 00:26.628
Come on, Dad,
every time Mom goes away...

00:26.705 --> 00:30.038
you start wanting to do things with us.
It's not fair.

00:30.576 --> 00:32.168
So, what are you kids saying?

00:32.244 --> 00:35.111
What we're saying is, here's $10.

00:35.247 --> 00:36.737
Go to the movies. Run!

00:36.815 --> 00:39.511
Hey! Come on now! Y ou Mr. Smarty...

00:41.887 --> 00:43.218
Hi, Will, you want to go to a movie?

00:43.288 --> 00:46.382
Sure would, Uncle Phil.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate that.

02:16.415 --> 02:17.507
Dad?

02:17.816 --> 02:19.010
Hello?

02:20.185 --> 02:21.982
I think we lost him.

02:22.387 --> 02:24.753
Dad's pretty quick for a big guy.

02:25.691 --> 02:28.558
I mean, he kept up with the car
for a whole block.

02:29.161 --> 02:32.289
He couldn't help it.
He got his coat stuck in the door.

02:34.599 --> 02:36.590
Wow, Will, clean clothes.

02:36.668 --> 02:39.603
What, is your probation officer
stopping by?

02:43.542 --> 02:46.909
No, my buddy, Keith, is coming out
from Philly. I'm going to show him around.

02:46.978 --> 02:49.310
Great, he can hang out with Dad.

02:49.548 --> 02:52.574
Well, actually, you know, Keith is a comic.
He going to be large, too.

02:52.651 --> 02:55.347
He's coming out here,
there's a big showcase at a standup club.

02:55.420 --> 02:59.254
Y eah, well, I think I speak for all of us
when I say, "So what?"

03:01.860 --> 03:06.058
And I think I speak for myself when I say,
"Uncle Phil, they in here!"

03:10.569 --> 03:12.560
All right, who pushed me?

03:13.638 --> 03:15.538
- It was Ashley.
- No, it wasn't.

03:15.607 --> 03:16.972
Well, now, you look.

03:17.042 --> 03:20.637
Now, all I want to do is spend
some quality time with my family...

03:20.712 --> 03:24.170
and running alongside a car
is not what I had in mind.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.584
- Uncle Phil...
- What?

03:26.651 --> 03:30.348
Well, see, I was wondering, since
I'm not part of the immediate family...

03:30.422 --> 03:33.357
- I was wondering if I was immune...
- Sit down, Will.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.350
I'm gonna sit down right here...

03:36.428 --> 03:39.454
in the non-immediate family
section of the living room.

03:40.365 --> 03:43.425
And I'm gonna shut up
on my way down. Watch.

03:45.270 --> 03:48.000
Now, you listen, and you listen good.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.676
We are a family.
I know this because I pay the bills.

03:52.644 --> 03:56.546
So, we are going to start spending
time together. Lots of time.

03:57.282 --> 03:58.579
Lucky us.

03:59.084 --> 04:02.212
We are going to start
acting more like a family.

04:02.721 --> 04:04.655
Do I make myself clear?

04:04.790 --> 04:06.348
<i>Jawoh/, mein Fuehrer!</i>

04:09.227 --> 04:14.130
From now on, we're going to start
eating together and laughing together...

04:15.367 --> 04:19.861
and I'll think of a few more things as soon
as I finish watching those <i>Cosby</i> reruns.

04:23.508 --> 04:24.941
Master William...

04:25.010 --> 04:29.379
there's a young gentleman at the door
who thought you might find this funny.

04:33.318 --> 04:34.842
I love my work.

04:35.287 --> 04:37.983
<i>E</i> xcuse me, I need to call my therapist.

04:44.830 --> 04:47.628
How are you doing, man?
Y ou ain't got to hit me like that.

04:47.699 --> 04:49.963
Will, aren't you going to introduce us
to your company?

04:50.035 --> 04:54.028
Y eah. Uncle Phil, this is my buddy Keith
from Philly, and this is my Uncle Phil.

04:54.105 --> 04:56.266
How are you doing, Mr. Banks?
Nice to meet you.

04:56.341 --> 04:58.741
This is my cousin Ashley,
that's Hilary and that's Carlton.

04:58.810 --> 04:59.834
How you guys doing?

04:59.911 --> 05:03.540
Mr. Banks, I want to tell you, I appreciate
you letting me stay here for the weekend.

05:03.615 --> 05:05.640
- That was really great of you.
- <i>E</i> xcuse me?

05:05.717 --> 05:07.378
Whoa, Uncle Phil...

05:07.786 --> 05:12.120
I ain't had an opportunity to enlighten you
on what's going on here, but...

05:13.058 --> 05:15.424
Look, Uncle Phil, please,
if you let Keith stay here...

05:15.493 --> 05:18.951
I promise I'll stop making
them 976 calls on your car phone.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.428
Okay, if you let him stay...

05:23.501 --> 05:27.665
I'll take you to Chuck <i>E</i>. Cheese
and I'll tell the head rat it's your birthday.

05:31.009 --> 05:32.772
I'll go to an out-of-state college.

05:32.844 --> 05:34.812
Keith, my boy, welcome.

05:37.616 --> 05:40.107
Check it out, man.
I got the new hip joint for you to see.

05:40.185 --> 05:41.413
Damn, man, what is this?

05:41.486 --> 05:43.954
It's the interactive network TV.

05:44.956 --> 05:49.086
Sound like what black people buy when
they got too much time on their hands.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.628
- Here, come on, push a player.
- All right.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.557
- Look what's happening.
- Come on, man.

05:57.636 --> 05:59.331
- Aikman hands off to <i>E</i> mmitt.
- Man, come on.

05:59.404 --> 06:00.928
- Look!
- Y ou can do better than that.

06:01.006 --> 06:03.600
Touchdown!
Who's the man? Who's the man?

06:03.675 --> 06:05.575
Man, come on,
the game ain't even over yet.

06:05.644 --> 06:08.477
Please, you never could take it
when I bust your butt at something.

06:08.546 --> 06:10.036
'Cause you never beat me.

06:10.615 --> 06:13.675
Y ou must be getting old, baby,
your mind going.

06:14.786 --> 06:15.980
Let me refresh your memory.

06:16.054 --> 06:18.454
From the time we was in kindergarten,
every thing we did...

06:18.523 --> 06:20.821
I always beat you
like you stole something.

06:22.227 --> 06:23.888
Kind of like you just beat me now, huh?

06:23.962 --> 06:25.429
Man, I don't care about this game.

06:25.497 --> 06:28.295
I'm going up to my room,
get ready for my big act tomorrow.

06:28.366 --> 06:31.062
All you got to do is stand up there
and tell a couple jokes.

06:31.136 --> 06:35.300
Telling jokes... See, that's what
your drunk Uncle Lou do at weddings.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.508
Me, I'm a professional.

06:37.575 --> 06:39.634
Whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up.

06:39.911 --> 06:43.074
First of all, Uncle Lou is not a drunk, okay?

06:43.148 --> 06:44.672
He has an inner ear problem.

06:48.153 --> 06:51.179
That's why he always be
sliding out of his chair.

06:51.323 --> 06:55.919
And, second of all, anybody can get up
on a stage and tell a couple jokes.

06:56.594 --> 06:58.585
Why you go and say
something silly like that?

06:58.663 --> 07:01.496
There's a craft to this, man.
I take this real seriously.

07:01.566 --> 07:04.228
Please. Look, I been funny all my life.

07:04.970 --> 07:07.666
All your life you just been funny-Iooking.

07:08.606 --> 07:09.766
I mean, look at them big old ears.

07:09.841 --> 07:13.004
Lean over that way
and tell me what's going on in Somalia.

07:16.648 --> 07:21.312
Well, if I couldn't find my way to Somalia,
I could follow that big map on your head.

07:23.922 --> 07:25.787
Look at them big teeth,
all big and spaced out.

07:25.857 --> 07:27.882
What you floss with, a jump rope?

07:31.162 --> 07:33.494
Wait a minute,
was that a professional joke?

07:33.565 --> 07:34.998
- Y ou're damn right.
- Y es, it was.

07:35.066 --> 07:37.728
I think you going to have to pay me
to laugh at that one, bro.

07:37.802 --> 07:39.736
- Y ou think you can do better than that?
- Oh, please...

07:39.804 --> 07:41.772
- Show me, do something.
- All right.

07:42.874 --> 07:45.604
G, check it out.
Can we talk to you for a second?

07:45.677 --> 07:49.135
I'm off duty.
Y ou can talk, but I don't have to listen.

07:51.716 --> 07:54.344
All right, check it out. Is this funny or not?

07:54.419 --> 07:57.183
- Two gorillas go into a bar, right?
- Not.

08:06.898 --> 08:09.093
All right. Hey, Will, thanks for the ride.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.931
- Y ou don't have to hang around, though.
- No, I'm cool, man.

08:16.941 --> 08:19.808
Well, you go be funny,
I'm gonna go nab me a honey.

08:26.117 --> 08:28.483
- Keith, glad you could make the audition.
- Hi, how you doing?

08:28.553 --> 08:30.180
Thank you, I appreciate that.

08:33.091 --> 08:34.524
Hey, girl...

08:34.859 --> 08:38.522
you look so good, I'd marry your brother
just to get in your family.

08:48.606 --> 08:52.406
Y o, man, you see that?
That's called the l-want-Will walk.

08:54.979 --> 08:56.776
Y o, Keith, come here, man.

08:56.848 --> 08:57.940
Do the chivalry joint.

08:58.016 --> 08:59.643
Come on,
you know I'm trying to concentrate.

08:59.717 --> 09:01.480
Do the chivalry joint, man.

09:01.553 --> 09:03.214
Man, come on.

09:03.855 --> 09:05.379
All right.

09:08.326 --> 09:09.691
Hey, girl!

09:10.695 --> 09:13.960
Why don't you stand up
and wrap your arms around a real man?

09:17.335 --> 09:18.893
Okay, well, check it out.

09:18.970 --> 09:20.767
I got four words for you.

09:20.872 --> 09:23.568
Ho-li-day Inn.

09:25.043 --> 09:26.874
Come on, girl, you know you want to.

09:26.945 --> 09:30.403
<i>E</i> xcuse me, miss,
is this abrasive Negro bothering you?

09:32.484 --> 09:34.577
Y es, as a matter of fact, he is.

09:34.652 --> 09:35.949
Allow me.

09:37.655 --> 09:38.952
Now, you look here, buddy.

09:39.023 --> 09:41.821
Y ou have no business
bothering this sweet young lady.

09:41.893 --> 09:44.862
Now you apologize
and don't make me take off my belt.

09:45.763 --> 09:47.287
Not the belt, man. I'll be cool.

09:47.365 --> 09:49.458
All right, look, I'm sorry, okay?

09:50.201 --> 09:52.692
Now, you get out of her face, now!

10:01.813 --> 10:06.716
Look, miss, I'd just like to apologize
on behalf of my gender...

10:07.185 --> 10:08.743
for his rude behavior.

10:09.087 --> 10:10.486
That's okay.

10:10.788 --> 10:13.985
No, it's not.
He had no reason to act like that.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.857
I'm sorry.

10:17.629 --> 10:18.960
It's okay.

10:19.464 --> 10:23.298
- Look, could I call you sometime?
- Y eah.

10:24.736 --> 10:26.533
- Call me.
- Thank you.

10:36.147 --> 10:37.239
Y ou.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.346
- Me?
- Y ou a comic?

10:39.717 --> 10:41.241
I don't know you.

10:41.319 --> 10:44.755
Y eah, I'm known all over this town.
I'm Shecky.

10:45.823 --> 10:47.313
Shecky Shabazz.

10:49.527 --> 10:50.926
Y ou're funny, Shecky.

10:50.995 --> 10:53.657
No, I'm sorry, I'm not here for the audition.

10:53.731 --> 10:56.325
Y ou don't have to.
What I saw was good enough.

10:56.401 --> 10:59.268
Y ou're in the showcase. Y ou're on at 8:15.

11:00.905 --> 11:03.931
Y abba dabba do, I'm in the showcase, too!

11:11.049 --> 11:13.711
- Here you go, big guy.
- Thank you, son.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.693
Hilary, sweetheart,
how was work today, darling?

11:26.798 --> 11:29.824
It was great, Dad. Thanks for asking.

11:33.905 --> 11:36.430
It's wonderful spending time
with one's family.

11:36.507 --> 11:38.304
- Daddy.
- Y es, dearest?

11:38.843 --> 11:40.674
I'm feeling nauseous.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.347
I am, too. Let's take a break, kids.

11:47.518 --> 11:50.578
I think we can forget about those
Chinese checkers after the sing-along.

11:50.655 --> 11:51.679
Great.

11:51.756 --> 11:54.247
But the sing-along's still on, right?

11:56.127 --> 11:57.992
Ow! Y ou're hurting my arms!

11:59.564 --> 12:02.294
- Keith.
- Hi, Mr. Banks.

12:02.934 --> 12:05.562
- Are you all right, son?
- Y eah, I'm fine.

12:05.970 --> 12:08.632
Look, I just want to say
that it's a pleasure...

12:08.706 --> 12:12.107
to finally meet one of Will's friends
who has his head on straight.

12:12.343 --> 12:14.903
Y ou have been a very positive influence
on him, son.

12:14.979 --> 12:16.207
Thank you, sir.

12:16.281 --> 12:18.749
Y ou know, I used to think so, too.

12:23.988 --> 12:25.012
Hey, Uncle Phil...

12:25.089 --> 12:28.149
you know how you've been staying on me
to make some decisions in my life?

12:28.226 --> 12:29.250
Y eah.

12:29.327 --> 12:31.625
Well, hanging with Keith,
I've decided what I want to do.

12:31.696 --> 12:33.323
Great. What is it?

12:33.398 --> 12:36.799
Well, I want to do something that makes
a difference and makes people feel good.

12:36.868 --> 12:38.199
That's wonderful.

12:39.003 --> 12:40.971
I want to be a comedian.

12:45.977 --> 12:48.537
Uncle Phil, I don't think
"comedian" is a bad word.

12:48.613 --> 12:50.103
It is in this house.

12:50.181 --> 12:53.446
I just spent thousands of dollars
sending you to a topnotch prep school.

12:53.518 --> 12:56.885
Maybe I should have just sent you
to Camp Funnypants.

12:57.889 --> 13:02.189
Look, I bet Sinbad's parents supported him
when he wanted to be a comedian.

13:02.794 --> 13:04.659
They named him Sinbad!

13:06.898 --> 13:09.799
He had two options: Pirate or comic.

13:11.636 --> 13:13.604
Look, Uncle Phil, I know it's a shock...

13:13.671 --> 13:17.004
but think of all the money you'll save
by not sending me to college.

13:18.042 --> 13:20.340
There is no future in it, Will.

13:20.611 --> 13:24.445
Come on, Uncle Phil, can I help it
that I'm this incredibly handsome...

13:24.549 --> 13:28.212
incredibly talented guy with star quality?

13:28.986 --> 13:32.615
Uncle Phil,
this thing is bigger than both of us.

13:34.859 --> 13:36.087
Sort of.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.464
I just want you to go to college, that's all.

13:44.535 --> 13:46.799
Uncle Phil, and I will if this doesn't work.

13:46.871 --> 13:49.840
But come on,
you got to let me take my shots in life.

13:49.907 --> 13:51.932
Y ou really want this badly, huh, son?

13:52.443 --> 13:53.808
Y es, I do.

13:54.045 --> 13:57.208
And you actually think
you can make a success of it?

13:57.382 --> 13:58.679
Y es, sir, I do.

13:59.350 --> 14:01.875
Well, son, I...

14:02.787 --> 14:04.982
guess there's only one thing for me to do.

14:05.656 --> 14:07.681
I'm going to nail your behind to the floor.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.023
And if I catch you
anywhere near a comedy club...

14:10.094 --> 14:12.028
I'm going to break every funny bone
in your body.

14:12.096 --> 14:14.496
Do I make myself perfectly clear?

14:16.167 --> 14:17.532
Perfectly.

14:20.204 --> 14:22.069
Y o, Keith, man, what's up?

14:23.007 --> 14:25.305
What's up?
That's what I've been trying to figure out.

14:25.376 --> 14:27.367
I thought you was my boy.

14:27.745 --> 14:30.043
- I am. What are you talking about?
- No, you're not.

14:30.114 --> 14:32.139
Not after what you pulled today
at the audition.

14:32.216 --> 14:35.049
What, are you mad at me
that I got in the showcase?

14:35.119 --> 14:38.384
I mean, I just walked in and the lady
gave it to me. I wasn't going for it.

14:38.456 --> 14:40.048
Y eah, but I was.

14:40.992 --> 14:43.051
And, you got it. So what's your beef?

14:43.127 --> 14:45.960
Y ou don't get this, huh?
I worked my butt off to get here, man.

14:46.030 --> 14:47.793
Y ou know how many clubs
I got booed out of?

14:47.865 --> 14:51.301
How many dives I had to play till I got
a routine that finally worked for me?

14:51.369 --> 14:54.600
This ain't nothing but a joke to you.
To me this is serious.

14:55.406 --> 14:57.533
So, what, you asking me to back out?

14:57.608 --> 15:00.702
No, I'm asking you
to just show me some respect.

15:01.179 --> 15:02.237
Respect?

15:02.313 --> 15:04.679
I walk through the door
and before my butt hit the chair...

15:04.749 --> 15:08.207
the lady was giving me a job.
Y ou could learn something from me.

15:09.954 --> 15:11.148
Really?

15:11.222 --> 15:14.623
Well, I'll be off-stage taking notes
tomorrow night, okay?

15:14.692 --> 15:16.922
Y ou better bring a big pad.

15:22.633 --> 15:26.330
We'll be right back in five minutes
with another hot comic.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.104
Well, I guess I'm up next, guys.

15:31.509 --> 15:34.910
Will, I took the liberty
of writing out a few humorous barbs...

15:34.979 --> 15:36.742
that you might find useful.

15:36.814 --> 15:38.179
Listen and laugh.

15:38.249 --> 15:42.151
Did you hear what the snail said
when he rode on the back of the turtle?

15:42.887 --> 15:44.149
No, Carlton, what?

15:44.222 --> 15:45.712
Whee!

15:47.758 --> 15:50.158
Now, you should use that one
for your big finish.

15:50.228 --> 15:54.392
No, maybe you should try this one.
Why did the turkey cross the road?

15:54.966 --> 15:57.298
I know I'm going to regret this, but why?

15:57.368 --> 15:59.063
Chicken's day off.

16:00.638 --> 16:03.004
<i>E</i> at your heart out, Rodney Dangerfield.

16:04.275 --> 16:06.368
Hey, I'm giving you gold here.

16:07.445 --> 16:10.505
See, Carlton, this is why people
trip you in the halls.

16:11.582 --> 16:14.881
Don't be proud, Will.
Take it. Y ou'll thank me later.

16:14.952 --> 16:17.921
Carlton, I'm going to be hilarious.
And when I get done with Keith...

16:17.989 --> 16:21.982
the only job opportunity he's going
to have is putting lids on Slurpees.

16:23.561 --> 16:24.892
Ladies and gentlemen...

16:24.962 --> 16:28.398
please put your hands together for our
next comedian from Philadelphia, PA...

16:28.466 --> 16:30.559
give it up for Will Smith.

16:36.974 --> 16:38.441
What's up?

16:39.610 --> 16:40.975
What's up?

16:42.146 --> 16:44.171
Hey, how y'all doing out there?

16:45.082 --> 16:48.950
I'm a little tired, though, you know.
I had a rough date last night.

16:49.020 --> 16:52.183
I went out with this girl
who ain't have no arms.

16:52.456 --> 16:56.859
I took her to <i>The Arsenio Ha// Show</i>
and she was like...

17:01.232 --> 17:04.065
Well, that's cool, check it out,
check it out, check it out.

17:04.135 --> 17:06.228
I should be mad
at my cousin Carlton, though...

17:06.304 --> 17:10.001
'cause he set me up with her.
But he ain't no prize hisself.

17:10.074 --> 17:14.477
He kind of look like a miniature
Bryant Gumbel on a bad hair day.

17:17.515 --> 17:19.540
That's cool, check it out.

17:19.717 --> 17:24.381
But actually, my cousin Carlton,
he don't have no problem buying clothes...

17:24.454 --> 17:26.012
'cause he's so short...

17:26.089 --> 17:30.186
he just rips them off his G. I. Joe doll
and wears 'em right out of the box.

17:38.502 --> 17:41.335
Will's really bombing up there.
We should do something.

17:41.405 --> 17:42.736
Good idea.

17:43.541 --> 17:45.839
Boo! Get off the stage!

17:45.910 --> 17:49.004
We want our money back!
Go back where you came from!

17:51.482 --> 17:54.315
What's up? What's up?

17:55.720 --> 17:57.950
Give me that before you hurt yourself.

17:58.022 --> 18:00.650
Give Will Smith a big round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:00.725 --> 18:04.525
Come on, y'all can do better than that.
Give him a big round of applause.

18:04.695 --> 18:07.027
He'll be back, just not in here.

18:09.567 --> 18:11.592
I hope you're funnier than the last guy.

18:11.669 --> 18:14.069
I know I ain't getting heckled
by no Jheri curl.

18:16.941 --> 18:20.934
And you got the nerve to be smoking, too?
What you trying to do, kill us all?

18:21.012 --> 18:23.913
Y ou know, I ain't going to bother
no Jheri curl, 'cause I know that...

18:23.981 --> 18:27.473
plastic bag makes so much noise at night,
you're always irritable, huh?

18:27.551 --> 18:29.883
Crumple, crumple. "I cannot sleep!"

18:30.321 --> 18:32.221
Maybe I better speak to you
in your language.

18:32.289 --> 18:34.189
Drip, drip, drip, drip.

18:35.593 --> 18:36.617
I'm new in L.A.

18:36.694 --> 18:38.992
I know there's things you can't do.
Y ou can't wear colors.

18:39.063 --> 18:40.428
Can't wear red. One gang will beat you up.

18:40.498 --> 18:41.988
Can't wear blue.
Other gang will beat you up.

18:42.066 --> 18:44.034
Last night, I thought I was slick
and put on plaid.

18:44.101 --> 18:46.296
Two golfers beat the hell out of me, ya'II.

18:47.071 --> 18:51.337
And everybody in L.A. Got a car phone.
Don't matter how messed up the car.

18:51.409 --> 18:53.673
Sometime the phone
is the best thing on the car.

18:53.744 --> 18:55.109
Y ou could tell the car raggedy.

18:55.179 --> 18:57.477
<i>E</i> very time the phone ring,
the car just cut off.

18:57.548 --> 18:59.709
"Girl, I'm glad you called. I need a jump.

18:59.784 --> 19:02.218
"Stop calling me or I'll never get home."

19:02.453 --> 19:03.852
But I do this 'cause I want to be rich.

19:03.921 --> 19:06.549
I don't want to be rich
for the petty reasons that many of you do.

19:06.624 --> 19:08.148
I want to be rich so I can sleep late.

19:08.225 --> 19:11.683
'Cause when you're broke, you know
you got to get up at 6:00 in the morning.

19:11.762 --> 19:14.253
Sometimes you accidentally wake up
at 3:00.

19:14.598 --> 19:15.997
"Am I late?"

19:16.734 --> 19:19.134
And black people set their alarm clock
30 minutes early...

19:19.203 --> 19:21.694
so they can hit that snooze button
three times.

19:22.106 --> 19:23.573
"That was a drill.

19:24.842 --> 19:26.776
"I'm going to get it right next time."

19:28.946 --> 19:30.277
And now they're saying
there's a recession.

19:30.347 --> 19:32.212
Black folks, we didn't know
there was a recession...

19:32.283 --> 19:34.683
'cause we been broke
since the day before forever.

19:34.752 --> 19:36.617
Black folks found a way
to get around being broke...

19:36.687 --> 19:38.951
'cause we'll put some stuff on layaway,
won't we?

19:39.023 --> 19:40.957
And leave it for a long time.

19:41.025 --> 19:43.994
I know brothers still got
bell-bottoms on layaway.

19:44.729 --> 19:46.424
Y ou ever left stuff on layaway so long...

19:46.497 --> 19:48.465
you don't even recognize it
when you get back?

19:48.532 --> 19:51.296
"Damn, when did I get
an eight-track tape player?

19:51.635 --> 19:53.865
"It's paid for now." We do, man.

19:53.938 --> 19:56.736
And white folks, you see them
in the unemployment office all the time.

19:56.807 --> 19:59.332
"$210 a week? How the hell
am I going to live on $210 a week?"

19:59.410 --> 20:02.379
A brother be right behind him.
"$210 a week? For nothing?

20:02.446 --> 20:04.880
"Baby, get the kids. We done come up."

20:05.783 --> 20:06.977
It's basic differences. They just are.

20:07.051 --> 20:08.882
Like black parents are different
than white parents.

20:08.953 --> 20:10.079
No better, no worse, just different.

20:10.154 --> 20:11.280
Saw a movie called <i>Po/tergeist.</i>

20:11.355 --> 20:14.051
In the movie, a little white child
trapped in a TV set. Start crying:

20:14.125 --> 20:17.822
"Oh, my God! Carol Anne's in the TV.
What are we going to do?"

20:18.395 --> 20:21.023
Y ou know, had that been a black mother,
she'd have been proud.

20:21.098 --> 20:24.295
Pick up the phone, call her best friend,
"Girl, turn to Channel 2.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.701
"My baby's on TV!"

20:33.511 --> 20:36.810
But white people, I love you guys.
Y'all get to do stuff we don't get to do.

20:36.881 --> 20:38.212
White people get to die and come back.

20:38.282 --> 20:41.183
<i>E</i> lvis been dead 15 years.
People still seeing this brother.

20:41.252 --> 20:43.152
When a black man is gone, he's just gone.

20:43.220 --> 20:46.383
Y ou don't see brothers talking about,
"Man, I just saw Marvin Gaye!

20:47.324 --> 20:48.951
"He was at the mall!"

20:49.026 --> 20:51.654
"How do you know?"
"I heard it through the grapevine."

20:51.962 --> 20:54.726
Y ou guys have been great.
Thank you very much.

20:58.335 --> 21:00.599
Give it up for Keith Campbell.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.654
- Good morning, Uncle Phil.
- Morning, Will.

21:18.722 --> 21:22.180
I hear your friend Keith really blew them
away last night at the standup club.

21:22.259 --> 21:25.251
Man, you should have seen
how he handled them hecklers.

21:26.530 --> 21:31.229
I mean, how I heard somewhere
that he handled the hecklers.

21:32.736 --> 21:35.603
Don't worry, Will, I know you were there
and I'm not going to kill you.

21:35.673 --> 21:38.767
Because I heard you already died
a pretty horrible death.

21:40.711 --> 21:42.906
Y o, it was nasty, Uncle Phil.

21:43.981 --> 21:46.074
I guess I ain't as funny as I thought.

21:46.150 --> 21:49.608
I could have told you that.
Ain't nothing you do funny to me.

21:50.487 --> 21:52.352
That's pretty cold, Uncle Phil.

21:52.423 --> 21:55.790
Y eah, well, so is the world if you
don't have an education and a good job.

21:55.860 --> 21:59.296
All right, I mean, I learned my lesson,
Uncle Phil, but come on.

21:59.363 --> 22:02.526
Look, I'm funny.
All right, here, check it out.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.329
Knock, knock.

22:05.369 --> 22:07.428
- Who's there?
- Amy Fisher.

22:07.671 --> 22:09.070
- Amy...
- Bang!

22:17.248 --> 22:18.237
Y o, yo, yo.

22:18.349 --> 22:21.682
Hey, I'm on my way to the airport,
but thank you guys for all your hospitality.

22:21.752 --> 22:23.151
I appreciate that.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.745
<i>E</i> verybody, except for you, Geoffrey.

22:25.890 --> 22:27.448
Y ou don't think I'm funny, do you?

22:27.524 --> 22:29.151
For a tip I might.

22:29.226 --> 22:32.252
Okay, well, I got a tip for you. Tails is out.

22:34.465 --> 22:36.990
So are you. There's the door.

22:41.705 --> 22:43.366
Now, that's funny.

22:48.012 --> 22:50.276
And everybody in L.A. Is a vegetarian.
What is this?

22:50.347 --> 22:51.939
"I don't eat red meat. I don't eat pork."

22:52.016 --> 22:55.315
Y ou know, it's cool to have a baked potato
or a salad every once in a while...

22:55.386 --> 22:58.355
but at a certain level of hungry,
I need something dead on my plate...

22:58.422 --> 23:00.447
something that used to have
horns and hoofs.

23:00.524 --> 23:02.014
And they put parsley
on black people's plates.

23:02.092 --> 23:04.560
I asked the waiter, "Man,
why you putting parsley on my plate?"

23:04.628 --> 23:06.858
He said, "It's a decoration,
it make your plate look pretty."

23:06.931 --> 23:10.264
I'm like, "y o, man, wouldn't an extra
shrimp make my plate look even better?"
