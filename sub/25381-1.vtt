01:46.315 --> 01:48.192
Straight through to
the conservatory.

01:50.361 --> 01:54.782
<i>One always expected Mike to get the
nod after a lifetime's loyal service.</i>

01:55.950 --> 01:58.536
That's not to take away
from cbes and obes.

01:59.578 --> 02:02.665
Of course, any order of the British
empire is a huge achievement.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.085
No...

02:07.044 --> 02:08.378
Uh, yes, that's for the kitchen.

02:10.548 --> 02:14.552
Didn't Luke's school dinner lady
get an mbe a couple of years ago?

02:15.219 --> 02:18.097
Yes. Mbes tend to be for more...

02:18.347 --> 02:20.766
- Hands on service.
- Hmm.

02:21.559 --> 02:25.688
So, will you be expecting us to
call you lady abbott from now on?

02:25.813 --> 02:29.608
Not necessarily, but it does
have a rather nice ring to it.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.797
Come on. Let's have
a naughty Sherry.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.656
- Not over there!
- Sorry, ma'am.

02:38.576 --> 02:42.663
<i>During my four decades on the beat,
I've worked with some fantastic people.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:44.933
I've also had the pleasure

02:44.957 --> 02:47.751
of working with a number
of great partners.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.128
Aw.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.214
Not in the biblical
sense of course.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.507
Joking aside,

02:54.049 --> 02:55.885
there's been one
very special person

02:56.468 --> 02:59.680
who has walked the thin blue line
with me every step of the way,

03:00.097 --> 03:02.641
throughout every trial,
case and verdict,

03:03.475 --> 03:06.770
and that is my wife of 35
years, lady Sandra abbott.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.022
Aw.

03:08.564 --> 03:09.690
Thank you.

03:20.492 --> 03:24.055
Are you losing sleep about what's going
to be happening from here on in?

03:24.079 --> 03:25.497
No, thank you. What do you mean?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.625
When Hugo retired,

03:27.917 --> 03:30.896
I was on the verge of getting
a part-time job in waitrose

03:30.920 --> 03:32.004
just to get away from him.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.773
I'm not concerned
about that, Janet.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.258
I've been planning our retirement
for the last 35 years.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.344
Oh, well, good for you, darling.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.513
- Top up?
- Oh, lovely. I'll spend a penny.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.185
- Oh, are you enjoying it?
- Marvellous!

04:01.659 --> 04:02.969
What the hell's going on?

04:02.993 --> 04:04.286
We were just...

04:04.620 --> 04:06.163
It's not what it
looks like, Sandra.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.249
Sandra?

04:09.792 --> 04:10.792
Sandra!

04:11.585 --> 04:12.585
Sandra!

04:13.379 --> 04:15.398
- Sandra, wait!
- Get off me!

04:15.422 --> 04:17.702
- How long has it been going on?
- Let's not do this here.

04:17.726 --> 04:19.903
- How long, Mike?
- Since we all went to sorrento.

04:19.927 --> 04:20.927
Oh, bloody hell.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.180
That's nearly five years ago.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.201
I've had enough of all
this hide-and-seek, Mike.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.768
How could you do this to me?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.645
You're supposed to be my friend.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.855
We even took you to the palace.

04:32.231 --> 04:35.627
I... I didn't mean for
this to happen, Sandra.

04:35.651 --> 04:38.171
Oh, really? You knew precisely
what you were doing!

04:38.195 --> 04:40.882
Now, please calm down, Sandra.
Remember where you are.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.242
I know exactly where I am.
I'm in my own bloody home.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.348
I have spent my entire married life
putting you and your career first,

04:48.372 --> 04:50.653
and what got me through was
knowing that when you retired,

04:50.677 --> 04:52.644
we would share our
golden years together.

04:52.668 --> 04:53.919
But instead,

04:54.295 --> 04:56.898
you've traded me in
for a newer model.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.674
Let me tell you, Mike,

04:58.882 --> 05:01.361
she's had more than
one previous owner!

05:01.385 --> 05:05.347
And, and her bodywork
is mainly filler!

05:06.098 --> 05:07.098
Mum!

05:07.766 --> 05:09.935
- Dad, what have you done?
- Sandra...

05:11.020 --> 05:12.038
Sandra?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.564
Sandra!

05:22.281 --> 05:23.365
Sandra?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.035
Sandra!

05:26.660 --> 05:28.245
Please, let me explain.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.790
The last thing I wanted
to do was to hurt you.

05:32.041 --> 05:36.045
I know it must seem like I've
behaved in a terrible way, but...

05:36.920 --> 05:39.048
Look, one thing led
to another and...

05:39.965 --> 05:41.717
Oh, you know how it is.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.793
- Hello, Emma.
- Hi.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.361
Ooh!

06:00.778 --> 06:01.904
Woo-hoo!

06:15.167 --> 06:16.167
Excuse me!

06:16.585 --> 06:18.253
It's women only in here.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.733
Oi!

06:21.757 --> 06:23.509
That's my handbag!

06:23.717 --> 06:25.803
Come back here, you... wait!

06:31.683 --> 06:33.227
Gotcha.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.146
Charlie!

06:36.480 --> 06:39.066
Yeah, all ready to
go this end, Ted.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.527
- Bilge filter.
- Check!

06:42.194 --> 06:43.654
Rodding junction.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.383
- Check.
- Pump outlet.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.118
Oil filter tank?
Discharge connection?

06:49.243 --> 06:51.096
Check, check, check!

06:51.120 --> 06:52.538
Then we're good to go.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.123
I'll start her up.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.045
- She's sounding good, Charlie.
- Yeah.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.175
What's that?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.261
Jubilee clip.

07:07.719 --> 07:08.804
Where from?

07:09.388 --> 07:10.782
Oh, bollocks.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.367
Stop! Stop! Oh!

07:12.391 --> 07:14.017
Flipping hell!

07:14.518 --> 07:15.978
- Turn it off.
- I'm trying.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.107
Hello?

07:21.316 --> 07:23.152
Charlie? It's bif.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.629
<i>Is now a good time?</i>

07:24.653 --> 07:27.531
Uh, couldn't be better.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.677
<i>Some chancer took a
fancy to my handbag.</i>

07:30.701 --> 07:32.786
Would you be a love and
drop off my spare keys?

07:33.036 --> 07:35.414
Yeah, I'll be there right away.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.541
Thank you, pru.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.294
I really must get around
to buying one of these.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.672
Why, when you can just
borrow other people's.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.342
Did you get a good look at him?

07:47.593 --> 07:49.511
No.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.445
By the time I made it to the top
of the hill, I was seeing double.

07:52.598 --> 07:53.682
Say when.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.684
Woo-hoo-hoo! When! When! When!

07:56.310 --> 07:59.646
Shame about the bag, though.
I got it in Italy years ago.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.814
Hmm.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.460
What's that for?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.027
Oh, it's to cover your pension.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.255
- Put it away, Charlie.
- Oh, bif.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.739
- Please, please.
- No, come on.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.051
I lost my bus pass and a couple
of sachets of laxatives.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.076
All right.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.205
Does make you wonder why they
go to all that bother, though.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.541
Well, constipation.
It's a terrible thing.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.543
Right, we're here, love.
You all right?

08:48.278 --> 08:49.278
Yes.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.114
That'll be Â£37.50.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.075
Right.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.455
Keep a pound for yourself.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.924
I should really charge
you corkage, you know.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.774
Would you be so kind as to
carry my bags up to the door?

09:07.798 --> 09:10.509
Do me a favour, darling, I'm
a cab driver, not a footman.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.100
Please.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.686
Thank you, excuse me.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.690
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

09:27.276 --> 09:30.862
Any chance you could fix the front
window lock for me before you go?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.366
- I'd leave it.
- Why?

09:34.616 --> 09:37.016
With a bit of luck, somebody
might climb in and take the lot.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.512
Elizabeth, it's Sandra.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.661
Sandra! What a lovely surp...
What are you doing here?

10:01.685 --> 10:04.414
Mike's been having an affair with
Pamela Harper so I've left him.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.358
I tried calling your landline, but
apparently, you've changed your number.

10:07.382 --> 10:09.335
- Years ago.
- You might have let me know.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.403
I expect it's been
cut off anyway, now.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.357
Or perhaps you've buried it.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.119
I can only imagine what
everyone is saying back home.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.472
Now I know we weren't exactly
in our honeymoon period,

10:21.496 --> 10:23.976
but I just imagined his libido
had naturally declined with age,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.352
but it turns out he's been
bonking her behind my back

10:26.376 --> 10:27.937
- for over five years.
- Oh.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.689
I mean, what has she got
that I haven't got?

10:29.713 --> 10:31.340
She's a mistress, Sandra.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.152
- It's a fantasy.
- It's not a bloo... this is bloody real.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.136
Aren't you going to
offer me a drink?

10:36.470 --> 10:37.470
Oh, sorry.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.848
Um, well,

10:40.265 --> 10:41.350
I've got

10:41.642 --> 10:43.560
- peach Brandy or grappa?
- Yes, please.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.289
Well, that should stop anybody
rummaging in your drawers.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.356
I should be so lucky.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.792
- Hello.
- Charlie,

10:49.816 --> 10:51.526
this is my little
sister, Sandra.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.445
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.074
- Lady abbott.
- Oh.

10:57.616 --> 10:58.700
Honoured even.

10:59.743 --> 11:00.786
All right, well, uh,

11:01.536 --> 11:03.890
sounds like you've got a
lot of catching up to do.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.458
Uh, I'll see you on
Thursday, dear, all right?

11:09.211 --> 11:10.295
Bye.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.384
Lady abbott?

11:24.101 --> 11:26.228
I know it doesn't feel
like it at the moment,

11:26.478 --> 11:29.022
but this could be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.859
A chance to finally step
out from Mike's shadow.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.361
What do you mean?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.530
Excuse me.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.841
Do you have, er,
spoons or forks,

11:38.865 --> 11:41.719
anything that resembles
actual cutlery here?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.203
Another one of those.

11:44.246 --> 11:47.100
I always found him overbearing,
smug and self-important.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.334
Classic case of
small-man syndrome.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.461
My husband doesn't
have a small penis.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.883
I wasn't actually referring
to his genitalia, Sandra.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.570
I just wondered why
a man of his size

11:59.594 --> 12:01.531
got into the police force
in the first place.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.182
There was a minimum height
amnesty for a couple of years.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.328
That still doesn't excuse you
from sleeping with the enemy.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.455
The whole point of us
going to greenham common

12:09.479 --> 12:12.441
was to stand side by side
in female solidarity.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.421
You dropped your knickers at the first
suggestive glance through the fence.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.673
Mike was only doing his job.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.050
Guarding a bloody
nuclear weapon.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.261
It was the height of the
cold war, people were scared

12:23.285 --> 12:26.264
and they had every right to believe
that they needed a nuclear deterrent.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.224
- Poppycock.
- Can you not appreciate

12:28.248 --> 12:30.643
that not everyone is as brave
and self-sufficient as you?

12:30.667 --> 12:35.940
Some of us need to feel safe and secure
which is exactly what Mike offered me.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.133
Until he decided to
press the red button.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.155
I knew it was a
mistake coming here.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.460
How could I have expected you
of all people to understand?

12:44.484 --> 12:47.535
You've never stuck at a relationship
in your life because it takes you away

12:47.559 --> 12:51.038
from your devotion to yourself
and your latest crackpot cause.

12:51.062 --> 12:54.041
There's nothing crackpot about
trying to safeguard the planet.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.919
Oh, right, so what would
happen to the human race

12:56.943 --> 13:00.757
if everyone was too busy saving the
planet to make time to procreate?

13:00.781 --> 13:03.885
Oh, so the universe should be grateful
that you and Mike had a knee trembler?

13:03.909 --> 13:06.262
Ladies, could you
please quieten down?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.806
You're upsetting the
other customers.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.308
We're upsetting them?

13:10.332 --> 13:12.935
How about the lifetime of
heartbreak and betrayal

13:12.959 --> 13:15.062
that is inevitably
coming their way?

13:15.086 --> 13:17.899
Not that I would expect you to
understand with your cultural concubines

13:17.923 --> 13:18.924
and polygamy.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.235
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave!

13:21.259 --> 13:22.928
I beg your... how dare...

13:26.264 --> 13:28.493
Officers, there's been a
terrible misunderstanding.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.828
I was simply having a
very nice conversation

13:30.852 --> 13:33.206
- with the young manager there.
- Keep going.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.500
And when the, uh, my hand
inadvertously slipped...

13:35.524 --> 13:38.044
- Will you get your hands off me?
- All right, madam, calm down.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.546
I do hope you know who
you're dealing with.

13:40.570 --> 13:44.533
I'm married to the former chief
constable of surrey police.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.286
Her husband's been
cheating on her.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.413
I'm not surprised.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.437
What did they charge you with?

13:56.461 --> 13:58.922
Racial aggravation or
drunk and disorderly?

13:59.381 --> 14:02.026
Could we discuss this
in a less public forum?

14:02.050 --> 14:04.970
Sure, I'm coming down. Chuck
this in the bins, will you?

14:15.981 --> 14:19.651
I came down to the station, but
they said you were sleeping it off.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.152
This isn't funny, bif.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.013
If you hadn't been bullying me,
I wouldn't have got so upset

14:24.037 --> 14:25.716
and thrown the onion
bhaji at that woman.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.761
It was a man and you assaulted
him with a prawn dumpling.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.304
Why are you being so pernickety?

14:30.328 --> 14:33.790
Listen, why don't you have an
alka-seltzer, have a lie down,

14:33.915 --> 14:35.393
and I'll be back this afternoon.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.085
- Why? Where are you going?
- Dancing.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.910
Very good! Good, good, good!
And turn!

14:52.934 --> 14:55.228
Turn! Flick! Flick!

14:58.064 --> 15:00.233
- Flick! Flick! Flick!
- Flick!

15:01.735 --> 15:04.088
- Sorry, corrinna.
- Oh, no worries. You're with Ted.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.822
I've worked out some
new moves for us.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.117
Might want to put your
crash helmet back on.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.331
Very nice.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.209
Good, good! Sheila, great!

15:39.147 --> 15:40.148
Hello?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.733
<i>Sandra, it's me.</i>

15:42.734 --> 15:43.902
Oh, yes.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.655
Pamela's asked me to
move in with her.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.532
She wants us to make a
fresh start together.

15:50.784 --> 15:51.784
I thought it through,

15:52.452 --> 15:54.913
and I've decided it's in
everyone's best interest.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.040
How very bloody
thoughtful of you.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.459
Sandra, I hope that with time,

15:59.960 --> 16:02.921
you'll understand that I
never set out to hurt you.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.466
Hurt me? How about
bloody destroyed me?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.531
Okay, everyone,
let's take a break.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.541
- Oh, I'll never get it.
- Yeah. Here you go, Ted.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.918
Payment for your
labour the other day.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.754
What? Danger money, you mean.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.631
Oh, put it away.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.592
How did your Internet
date go at the weekend?

16:50.260 --> 16:52.380
Well, let's just say, I got
more than I bargained for.

16:52.404 --> 16:55.199
- Ooh, lucky you.
- No, he showed up with his wife in tow.

16:55.557 --> 16:59.102
Turns out I'd clicked swinging instead
of swimming on my list of likes.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.743
Ooh.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.064
These old locks are a bloody...

17:27.088 --> 17:29.924
You don't fancy changing the
one on my front door, do you?

17:32.260 --> 17:35.305
Oh, how you and her
majesty are sisters,

17:36.514 --> 17:37.658
I'll never know.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.618
Well, she used to be fun.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.311
Oh, yeah? What happened?

17:42.479 --> 17:43.980
She married a tosser,

17:44.147 --> 17:47.233
and then became obsessed with
keeping up with all the tossers.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.863
When was the last time you
saw one another, then?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.366
Erm, it's nearly ten years.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.954
I was protesting against
the newbury bypass.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.101
- Yeah?
- I failed to turn up

18:04.125 --> 18:06.479
- to her 50th birthday...
- Oh, dear.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.939
- And it was a murder mystery party...
- Oh!

18:08.963 --> 18:11.734
And I was the one who ended
up getting killed off.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.259
Yeah.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.970
Ah, I've got it, that's it.

18:17.931 --> 18:22.185
Well, you know, maybe this is an
opportunity for you to get to know

18:22.310 --> 18:23.895
one another again, eh?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.898
Ah, I think we're too stubborn,

18:27.232 --> 18:28.817
and set in our ways.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.029
You? Stubborn? Oh...

18:37.117 --> 18:39.119
- Here you are.
- No, thanks. I've had enough.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.162
Oh.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.457
- It's ringing.
- Yeah, they do that.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.876
- Uh, can you, erm...
- What?

18:48.002 --> 18:49.522
- How does it go...
- What? What is it?

18:49.546 --> 18:51.023
- Uh...
- That up there.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.900
- Okay.
- Well, speak into it.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.193
What? Okay.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.635
He... yes, hello?

18:55.760 --> 18:56.845
Yes?

18:58.012 --> 18:59.012
Oh.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.226
Okay. Um, well, thanks
for letting me know.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.395
I'm on my way.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.523
- What?
- Sandra's in hospital.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.735
I'm not surprised you're
having panic attacks.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.962
- What, with the stress of everything.
- It wasn't a panic attack.

19:16.986 --> 19:19.267
I'm not that sort of a person.
I just had a bit of a turn.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.585
Ready to board the fun bus?

19:22.370 --> 19:25.832
- Er, you go first, Sandra.
- Please come, come, come. This way.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.186
Um, shall I get in first?

19:29.210 --> 19:31.290
- 'Cause there's no seat.
- In you go. Help yourself.

19:31.314 --> 19:32.774
Shut the door. Let's get off.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.844
Right.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.763
Slide her across.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.079
Off we go. Oops.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.855
Are you both high?

19:50.398 --> 19:51.398
As kites.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.615
Ooh! Sorry.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.891
I can't believe you still
smoke wacky baccy.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.601
Oh, what's the big deal?

20:08.625 --> 20:11.228
There's really not that much
difference between a bag of weed

20:11.252 --> 20:12.938
and a bag of pharmaceuticals.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.132
There is a big difference between
licensed medicines and prohibited drugs.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.987
Yeah, well, my crop has
medicinal benefits, you know.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.989
You should try it
for your anxiety.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.699
Oh, mate, mate, come on.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.035
My only anxiety is whether
we make it back alive.

20:26.059 --> 20:30.206
And I have no intention of taking
any medication, legal or otherwise

20:30.230 --> 20:31.648
for a one-off incident.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.566
Well, actually,

20:35.610 --> 20:38.422
I was put on anti-depressants
a while back,

20:38.446 --> 20:41.300
when I was going through a
bit of a difficult time.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.426
Hmm.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.678
Well, actually, I...
I think it worked.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.204
I mean, if you were...

20:46.955 --> 20:50.434
If you break your leg, you don't limp
around like a stray dog, do you?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.293
I mean, you'd do something
about it, right?

20:52.627 --> 20:55.713
Perhaps, I should check myself
into battersea dogs home.

20:56.714 --> 20:59.259
Well, it's a thought, you know.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.831
- Thanks, Charlie. Bye.
- All right, bye, bif, yeah.

21:12.855 --> 21:16.001
Do me a favour, lady abbott, next
time you're in need of a lift,

21:16.025 --> 21:18.278
get Smithers to pick
you up in the Bentley.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.280
How rude!

21:20.863 --> 21:22.407
Perhaps if you'd said thank you.

21:22.907 --> 21:26.095
What for? The insults and
psychiatric evaluation?

21:26.119 --> 21:28.472
Who the hell do you
think you are, Sandra?

21:28.496 --> 21:31.016
Maybe your money and title
mean something where you live,

21:31.040 --> 21:32.583
but around here,
nobody gives a shit.

21:33.031 --> 21:34.311
Clearly, you were out of options

21:34.335 --> 21:36.170
or you wouldn't have
turned up on my doorstep.

21:36.546 --> 21:40.466
Get off your high horse and start treating
other people with some common manners.

22:17.378 --> 22:18.463
Here we go.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.443
For Christ's sake,
don't be such a prude.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.344
I've seen them before.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.387
Not in this condition,
you haven't.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.892
Gravity hits us all, Sandra.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.980
The challenge is to make sure our
spirits don't drop quite as far.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.523
Look,

22:39.108 --> 22:42.296
I want to help you get back on your feet,
but you're making it very difficult.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.863
I'm not like you, bif.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.447
I...

22:45.990 --> 22:47.450
I can't just...

22:49.160 --> 22:51.454
Open up like a lotus flower.

22:53.122 --> 22:57.019
I know when we were growing up, showing
emotions was seen as a weakness,

22:57.043 --> 23:00.338
but in my experience, bottling
them up gets you nowhere.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.842
This is like a bad dream
that I can't wake up from.

23:07.261 --> 23:11.265
Mike and I were supposed to be setting off
on a cruise around the adriatic tomorrow.

23:13.643 --> 23:17.039
Why don't you come down with me
to my dance class next Thursday?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.272
It might cheer you up.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.027
I've been made to feel enough
of a fool already, thank you.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.381
What are you talking about?

23:25.405 --> 23:27.115
You're a great dancer.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.158
That was a lifetime ago.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.169
Where did you get this?

23:41.087 --> 23:44.775
I had dad's super-8 film transferred
to DVD a few years ago.

23:44.799 --> 23:46.384
I meant to send you a copy.

23:48.845 --> 23:52.908
Do you remember mum sewing all that
stiff, nasty net onto the petticoat?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.292
Mmm. I remember it.
It was like...

23:55.017 --> 23:56.894
Dancing in a cheese grater.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.691
What was his name again?

24:02.984 --> 24:04.777
Gregory Powell.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.448
I bumped into him a few
years ago in guildford.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.451
Camp as Christmas.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.578
No surprises there, though.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.168
I look so happy.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.670
You were.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.208
Come on, we're gonna
miss the warm up.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.710
I'd be happy to miss the
whole bloody thing!

25:09.258 --> 25:11.177
Morning, everyone.
Sorry we're late.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.597
Oh, here she is.
Lady never shit.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.308
You didn't tell me he'd be here.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.953
Corrinna, this is
my sister, Sandra.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.097
She's going to be joining us
today, is that all right?

25:22.121 --> 25:24.457
Yeah, of course. Find
a space, ladies.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.779
- Hello, I'm Jackie.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.156
- You staying with bif?
- Yes.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.218
- How long?
- Not really sure,

25:34.242 --> 25:35.761
just taking one day at a time.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.578
Sandra's marriage
has just collapsed.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.250
Jackie's a veteran where affairs
of the heart are concerned.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.544
Been married five times.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.338
First one broke down
for religious reasons.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.799
He thought he was god. I didn't.

25:50.758 --> 25:53.302
Okay, everyone, time to
get rid of the cobwebs.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.888
It's the only thing that's
holding Ted together.

25:56.097 --> 25:57.848
Yeah, that and
this bloody lycra.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.954
All right. Okay,
everyone, form a circle.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.938
And everyone hold hands
with their neighbour.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.566
- Sandra?
- There we go.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.697
All right, I think we
all know what to do.

26:14.365 --> 26:17.302
<i>âª You put your left leg in âª</i>

26:17.326 --> 26:19.245
<i>âª your left leg out âª</i>

26:19.662 --> 26:22.957
<i>âª in out in out you
shake it all about âª</i>

26:23.332 --> 26:26.711
<i>âª you do the hokey cokey
and you turn around âª</i>

26:27.086 --> 26:29.797
<i>âª and that's what
it's all about âª</i>

26:30.214 --> 26:31.358
<i>âª oi âª</i>

26:31.382 --> 26:34.802
<i>âª whoa the hokey cokey âª</i>

26:35.261 --> 26:38.347
<i>âª whoa the hokey cokey âª</i>

26:39.181 --> 26:42.435
<i>âª whoa, the hokey cokey âª</i>

26:43.019 --> 26:46.314
<i>âª knees bend all
stretch ra ra ra âª</i>

26:49.150 --> 26:51.086
Okay, everybody,
find your partners.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.629
Charlie, where are you, Charlie?

26:52.653 --> 26:54.488
It's time to waltz.

26:54.947 --> 26:55.947
Zach!

26:56.991 --> 26:58.743
I'll be the guy,
you be the girl.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.417
One, two, three.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.086
One, two, three, two, two...

27:10.921 --> 27:12.673
One, two, three, two, two...

27:13.090 --> 27:14.592
One, two, three, two, two...

27:14.884 --> 27:16.320
I can count, bif.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.637
I know.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.180
Again.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.020
What is it, Ted?

27:26.145 --> 27:27.521
Just give me a minute, will you?

27:28.814 --> 27:30.775
- Ted?
- It's all right. I've got it.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.164
That was our wedding
tune, Charlie.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.210
Sets me... sets me
off every time.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.775
You're spinning me too fast.
I'm getting disorientated.

27:54.799 --> 27:55.799
I can tell.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.305
Where are you going? Sandra?

28:02.682 --> 28:03.974
It's just some days, I...

28:04.975 --> 28:07.353
I wish we'd gone together.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.956
Oh, man. Oh, yeah.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.691
I know. I know. I know.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.279
Oh, I... just wanted
to spend a penny.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.074
Spend as much as you like.

28:21.409 --> 28:22.702
Bog's down there.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.918
Oh, man. All right, mate.

28:32.795 --> 28:33.879
Come on.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.007
All right, darling, I'll
see you on Saturday.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.843
Okay, bye.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.029
- Who is that?
- Nicola.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.889
- Huh?
- My daughter, your niece.

28:44.098 --> 28:46.434
- Oh, of course.
- Where did I put my drink?

28:47.685 --> 28:50.247
She's gonna bring Luke, my
grandson, up to visit me,

28:50.271 --> 28:52.471
- so you can finally get to meet him.
- Oh, I'd love to,

28:52.495 --> 28:54.776
but it'll have to be another time.
I've already got plans.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.278
- Like what?
- I'm going on a date.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.196
Aren't you past all that?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.535
Last time I checked, there wasn't an
age limit for getting your leg over.

29:03.367 --> 29:04.687
Can I borrow your
phone a minute?

29:13.794 --> 29:15.629
There you are.

29:40.404 --> 29:44.200
Cor, you've... A bit
of a tangle here, lil.

29:49.205 --> 29:50.456
What is it, love?

29:51.791 --> 29:53.042
Hey.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.544
Do you want something?

29:57.755 --> 29:59.507
I want to see Charlie.

30:01.175 --> 30:02.843
You're looking at him, love.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.805
I am Charlie.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.265
Don't touch me.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.185
All right, love. Um...

30:12.061 --> 30:15.272
Why don't we, erm, go for a walk, eh?
Get a bit of air?

30:15.648 --> 30:16.648
Eh?

30:16.690 --> 30:17.900
Get off me.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.404
Leave me alone.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.578
That's a very snazzy
hat Luke's wearing.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.206
Pamela bought it for him.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.668
Why is she buying him presents?

30:36.001 --> 30:37.086
Mum.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.256
I wish I could change what's
happened but I can't.

30:41.298 --> 30:42.758
I know you're hurting, but...

30:44.301 --> 30:46.178
I just want to have a
nice day with you.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.599
Grandma, can you push me?

30:51.600 --> 30:53.435
I can. Yes.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.109
Why aren't you living
with grandpa any more?

31:03.487 --> 31:04.487
Um...

31:05.447 --> 31:06.657
Remember when

31:06.866 --> 31:09.719
Oscar broke your new transformer
and you said you never wanted

31:09.743 --> 31:12.746
- to speak to him again?
- Yeah.

31:13.402 --> 31:15.642
Well, that's sort of what's
happened with me and grandpa.

31:15.666 --> 31:19.420
So, you'll come back if he
buys you a new transformer?

31:22.548 --> 31:23.716
Maybe.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.057
You're not going to leave
me out here in the...

31:35.728 --> 31:37.730
Gerald, Gerald, Gerald.
Come in here.

31:38.188 --> 31:39.732
No, no, let's go in here.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.454
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, one sec.
One sec.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.058
What are you doing?

32:15.059 --> 32:16.393
Warming you up.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.065
Don't worry about that.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.984
I'm armed and dangerous.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.904
Thirty minutes and
I'll be good to go.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.301
I'll get you there in ten.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.077
Yeah.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.509
Oh.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.227
Ahh.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.322
Gerald?

33:12.157 --> 33:13.325
Gerald?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.452
Gerald!

33:18.789 --> 33:20.624
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.960
But I don't think Gerald is.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.217
He was a lovely fella.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.886
Funny, kind...

33:33.512 --> 33:35.073
- Hung like a...
- Please.

33:35.097 --> 33:37.474
Too much information.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.602
I can't believe you're
laughing about him, poor man.

33:41.270 --> 33:44.082
Gerald clocked-off with a
smile on his face, Sandra.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.983
That's all any of
us can hope for.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.486
Aren't you scared of dying?

33:50.863 --> 33:52.448
What's there to
be frightened of?

33:53.699 --> 33:54.742
Well, the fact that...

33:55.909 --> 33:56.952
That that's it.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.496
As Mark twain said,

34:00.039 --> 34:03.435
I was dead for billions of years
before I was born and had not suffered

34:03.459 --> 34:05.502
the slightest
inconvenience from it.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.465
Slow, slow,

34:09.590 --> 34:11.609
quick, quick, slow,

34:11.632 --> 34:13.302
side together.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.554
Slow, slow,

34:15.804 --> 34:17.431
quick, quick, slow,

34:17.848 --> 34:19.600
side together.

34:19.933 --> 34:23.812
Okay, has everyone got that? Yeah?
All right, find a partner.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.273
Oh, um, Charlie.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.735
Can... you know it, don't you?
Can you be with Sandra, please?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.005
Yep, thank you.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.489
Zach, music.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.331
Five, six, seven, eight.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.667
Okay, turn, turn.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.129
Slow, side, together.

34:51.840 --> 34:52.840
Yep.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.676
Uh, look,

34:55.886 --> 34:57.781
I know this goes against
every instinct,

34:57.805 --> 35:00.599
but, er, it might help if you...

35:01.058 --> 35:02.285
Let me lead?

35:02.309 --> 35:03.629
- Yes, I would.
- All right. Yeah?

35:03.653 --> 35:05.155
- Yes.
- Yeah?

35:06.814 --> 35:07.856
Hands higher.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.786
There, we made it.

36:04.454 --> 36:05.473
Yes.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.225
Great, lovely, everyone.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.084
Can you make your
way up here, class?

36:10.085 --> 36:12.438
Before we go onto
the next dance,

36:12.462 --> 36:15.441
Jackie has come up
with a rather fun idea

36:15.465 --> 36:18.135
of how we can challenge
ourselves this winter.

36:18.594 --> 36:21.114
I'm not tobogganing down
parliament hill again.

36:21.138 --> 36:23.056
You're just a sore loser.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.077
Throughout the winter,
every seven minutes,

36:26.101 --> 36:29.229
an elderly person
dies from cold.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.000
Now age uk are trying
to change that

36:32.024 --> 36:36.403
by raising funds for their new
campaign called, "spread the warmth."

36:37.154 --> 36:41.009
I think we're probably passed
our ice bucket challenge days,

36:41.033 --> 36:43.845
but one thing we all can
do is shake a leg or two.

36:43.869 --> 36:47.807
So how about we put on a
dance performance in public,

36:47.831 --> 36:49.225
and pass the hat around?

36:49.249 --> 36:50.500
Oh, yes.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.628
What dance were you thinking?

36:52.794 --> 36:55.231
Well, how about a
bit of everything?

36:55.255 --> 36:56.840
Yeah, like a mash-up.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.592
So who's gonna join us?

36:59.134 --> 37:00.177
I am.

37:00.302 --> 37:02.137
- Oh, come on, it's Christmas.
- Come on!

37:02.471 --> 37:03.639
Yes.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.226
Come on.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.065
Sandra, have you actually ever
seen a central heating bill?

37:13.899 --> 37:15.317
Don't be so patronising.

37:16.026 --> 37:18.153
I would happily make
a generous donation.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.073
I do not want to embarrass
myself in public.

37:21.698 --> 37:25.136
Surely one of the perks of being
old is it doesn't matter any more.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.370
Well, it does to me.

37:27.746 --> 37:31.124
You know, it's one thing being
scared of dying, Sandra,

37:31.541 --> 37:34.169
it's a whole different matter
being scared of living.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.339
That's it. Nearly there.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.218
All right. Oh,
there we go, love.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.136
What're you doing?

37:44.930 --> 37:47.641
Having tea with you.
Same as every Thursday.

37:49.393 --> 37:50.519
Here you are.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.275
It's your favourite, love.
It's chicken.

37:58.485 --> 37:59.987
Well, it was chicken.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.049
Oh, it's all right, Lilly,

38:03.073 --> 38:05.176
it's okay, love.
Calm down, love.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.961
It's all right, it's all right, it's
all right, Lilly. It's all right.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.473
- It's all right. It's your husband.
- Lilly.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.599
It's Charlie.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.791
Liar!

38:14.793 --> 38:17.254
It's all right. It's
all right, Lilly.

38:39.735 --> 38:40.819
Hiya!

38:41.695 --> 38:42.779
Hello.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.909
I take it you've not
seen daylight today?

38:48.702 --> 38:51.538
I've just been checking up
on some important emails.

38:51.955 --> 38:54.041
Virtual curtain
twitching, you mean.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.377
Just because you choose
not to do social media...

38:58.462 --> 39:00.898
How do you expect to take
control of your life

39:00.922 --> 39:03.133
when you're so obsessed
with everyone else's?

39:04.217 --> 39:07.179
Why don't you take the bike out?
Go for a ride?

39:07.554 --> 39:09.073
Get some fresh air.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.058
I can think of easier
ways to kill myself.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.685
Clearly.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.139
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:58.772 --> 40:01.918
Okay, stop, stop, stop!
This really is a mash-up.

40:01.942 --> 40:04.545
All right, look, don't
get disheartened.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.047
We will get there.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.882
Yeah, if I don't have
a coronary first.

40:07.906 --> 40:12.303
But you must practise these steps at home.
It's the only way we're gonna remember.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.472
I can't even remember
my own name.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.349
Okay, are we ready to go again?

40:16.373 --> 40:17.725
- Yes.
- Yeah.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.334
Okay. Zach, music.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.404
What the hell have you done?

40:29.428 --> 40:30.470
Tidied up.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.283
Well, how am I supposed
to find anything now?

40:34.307 --> 40:35.392
Just trying to help.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.228
All this food is way
past its sell-by date.

40:38.395 --> 40:42.500
Please don't tell me you subscribe
to the "best before" conspiracy?

40:42.524 --> 40:45.004
You won't be saying that when
you're struck down with botulism.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.171
"Best before 19..."

40:47.195 --> 40:48.530
Oh, blimey.

41:09.050 --> 41:13.388
It's left foot back, feet together,
right foot forward, feet together.

41:14.014 --> 41:15.223
Argh.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.786
You're losing your balance because
you're setting off on the wrong foot.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.104
Easy for you to say from
the comfort of the sofa.

41:21.730 --> 41:23.857
- Just trying to help.
- Well, don't!

41:33.241 --> 41:34.677
Hi, Charlie.

41:34.701 --> 41:35.928
She's in the day room.

41:35.952 --> 41:38.580
- Oh, I've come to see you, actually.
- Oh.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.628
Charlie, most of the time, she's
in a comfortable routine.

41:47.214 --> 41:49.508
Well, then that's the way I
want her to be all the time.

41:52.594 --> 41:54.888
Uh, I've been thinking, um...

41:56.139 --> 41:58.433
Maybe it's better for
Lilly if I, er...

41:59.643 --> 42:01.102
Don't come any more.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.526
Is that a bad idea?

42:09.402 --> 42:11.571
There's no right or wrong
in these situations.

42:12.656 --> 42:17.285
Look, you sold your house
to care for her, Charlie.

42:18.328 --> 42:20.205
No one could have
done anything more.

42:45.522 --> 42:46.690
Hello, love.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.121
Huh.

43:21.224 --> 43:22.475
Take care, love.

43:45.498 --> 43:46.541
Charlie?

43:48.960 --> 43:49.960
Charlie?

43:50.879 --> 43:53.340
I was just passing and
I thought maybe...

43:53.882 --> 43:56.968
Oh, wish you'd get this
bloody door sorted.

44:01.514 --> 44:02.599
What's up?

44:06.436 --> 44:08.897
Er, it was time to say goodbye.

44:10.774 --> 44:12.317
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

44:14.069 --> 44:15.111
Thanks, uh...

44:15.362 --> 44:16.821
Me too.

44:19.032 --> 44:20.283
You know, I...

44:22.869 --> 44:24.829
I spent my whole life

44:25.997 --> 44:27.874
fixing things, bif, you know?

44:29.876 --> 44:30.919
Uh...

44:31.378 --> 44:32.587
Pretty good at it.

44:37.717 --> 44:38.760
But there's nothing...

44:40.762 --> 44:44.075
Abs... absolutely nothing,

44:44.099 --> 44:45.475
nothing I could...

44:46.101 --> 44:48.520
I can do to fix... fix her.

44:52.649 --> 44:53.983
I'm sorry.

44:57.654 --> 45:00.699
How dare you do this to me?
I hate you so much!

45:50.081 --> 45:51.166
Aah!

45:58.923 --> 46:00.860
Oh, didn't hear you come in.

46:00.884 --> 46:03.303
Just walked in the door.
I got us a curry.

46:05.513 --> 46:07.098
You seem more upbeat today.

46:08.016 --> 46:11.060
Oh, I just got this annoying
tune going round in my head.

46:32.248 --> 46:33.708
Hmm, this one's for you.

46:34.959 --> 46:35.959
Hmm.

46:36.711 --> 46:37.711
Oh.

46:39.255 --> 46:40.548
More bills.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.221
What's the matter?

46:50.099 --> 46:51.434
Divorce petition.

46:52.477 --> 46:54.062
Well, weren't you
expecting that?

46:57.607 --> 46:59.275
What did you think
was gonna happen?

47:01.945 --> 47:03.785
Well, I thought he would
come to his senses and

47:05.698 --> 47:08.034
phone me up and beg
me to come home and

47:08.910 --> 47:10.370
so I could get on with my life.

47:10.745 --> 47:12.580
Oh, surely you
wouldn't have gone?

47:13.373 --> 47:15.500
I know you think I'm
mad, bif, but I've...

47:16.075 --> 47:18.395
I've loved Mike for most of my
life and whatever he's done,

47:18.419 --> 47:20.046
those feelings don't just...

47:22.298 --> 47:23.298
Go away.

47:23.716 --> 47:24.884
Nor this.

47:26.261 --> 47:28.054
You need to get an
expert opinion.

47:30.515 --> 47:31.975
What about him
selling the house?

47:32.642 --> 47:34.519
Well, if the bastard wants
to sell it, let him.

47:34.686 --> 47:37.456
Then Sandra could buy something
smaller with her share.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.983
And live comfortably off
the remaining equity.

47:41.276 --> 47:43.903
The good news is, you get
first dibs of the contents.

47:44.696 --> 47:47.258
All he's requested is the
elizabethan dining table,

47:47.282 --> 47:50.577
six cut glass tumblers,
and his tennis trophies.

47:51.077 --> 47:53.997
35 years of marriage, and
that's all he values?

47:55.456 --> 47:57.768
I'm sorry, Sandra, that was
shockingly clumsy of me.

47:57.792 --> 47:59.794
But I can still keep my title?

48:01.004 --> 48:02.797
I'm afraid it's not
your title, Sandra.

48:03.381 --> 48:06.509
When the marriage is dissolved, it will
be transferred to his chosen consort.

48:10.471 --> 48:13.933
Surely becoming a free woman is
better than being a kept lady.

48:23.985 --> 48:26.946
Good god, this place is obscene.

48:28.072 --> 48:30.158
- Did you have staff?
- You're looking at her.

48:30.325 --> 48:31.326
Oh.

48:31.492 --> 48:34.370
When we bought this house, I
thought we'd be here forever.

48:37.665 --> 48:38.665
Janet.

48:39.584 --> 48:40.811
What are you doing here?

48:40.835 --> 48:43.480
Sandra, what a surprise!

48:43.504 --> 48:46.984
No, I was just collecting some
spare balls from your court.

48:47.008 --> 48:50.404
I thought you wouldn't mind, for
the annual tennis tournament,

48:50.428 --> 48:51.429
this afternoon.

48:51.888 --> 48:53.741
Janet, this is my
sister, Elizabeth.

48:53.765 --> 48:54.933
Bif, hi.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.226
How long are you back for?

48:57.393 --> 48:59.413
Just the day, I'm collecting
some personal things

48:59.437 --> 49:01.373
from the house before
it's shown to buyers.

49:01.397 --> 49:05.568
I know. We saw it had gone on the market.
Such a shame.

49:06.152 --> 49:08.738
After all that work you'd
done with the patio.

49:08.947 --> 49:10.907
But still, you know,
life goes on.

49:12.492 --> 49:16.329
Maybe I'll find a minute to pop over and
say hello to the gang, before we leave.

49:17.038 --> 49:18.539
Oh, that would be a bit awkward.

49:19.666 --> 49:20.917
Mike is coming.

49:22.001 --> 49:23.002
And Pamela.

49:23.544 --> 49:27.173
Sadly, as much as one loves playing with
balls, one's rather pressed for time.

49:31.678 --> 49:36.099
No wonder you stuck it out for so long.
You must have barely seen one another.

49:37.392 --> 49:39.477
And what's with all
this silverware?

49:41.854 --> 49:43.606
It's like a bloody shrine.

49:44.649 --> 49:47.527
I used to spend hours
polishing those.

49:49.153 --> 49:51.781
And I think...

49:53.825 --> 49:56.619
Yes, from that tournament on,
he was sleeping with her.

49:58.663 --> 50:00.957
Well, he doesn't deserve
any prizes for that.

50:07.714 --> 50:09.817
- Come on, your turn!
- No, I can't!

50:09.841 --> 50:11.217
Just do it.

50:12.301 --> 50:14.262
Go on, Sandra. Give it to him.

50:20.435 --> 50:21.894
How does that make you feel?

50:22.770 --> 50:25.770
Well, I was gonna... I was gonna say
better than sex, but it's been so long,

50:25.794 --> 50:27.087
I've forgotten what it's like.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.194
Was Mike a good lover?

50:30.987 --> 50:32.697
I... I think so.

50:33.823 --> 50:36.159
Please tell me there
was life before Mike?

50:39.746 --> 50:42.749
No wonder you put all
that crap on a pedestal.

50:45.835 --> 50:47.545
- Hello.
- Hi.

50:48.046 --> 50:49.314
What are they doing here?

50:49.338 --> 50:51.025
Well, you needed a
man with a Van.

50:51.049 --> 50:52.675
I got you two for
the price of one.

50:59.307 --> 51:01.434
Charlie, I think I
owe you an apology.

51:02.894 --> 51:04.103
I must have come across

51:04.937 --> 51:06.481
quite rude when we first met.

51:06.773 --> 51:08.608
Ah, it's already forgotten.

51:10.276 --> 51:13.005
Anyway, I know how
disorientating it can be

51:13.029 --> 51:14.781
when you find
yourself on your own.

51:16.199 --> 51:17.492
Does it get any easier?

51:19.118 --> 51:20.118
I hope so.

51:20.453 --> 51:23.807
Oi! Are Ted and I the only
ones working around here?

51:23.831 --> 51:24.957
Oh, sorry.

51:25.083 --> 51:28.020
I'll need to report you for an
unscheduled rest break, Charlie.

51:28.044 --> 51:30.147
- You grass!
- Bugger!

51:30.171 --> 51:31.631
- Oh, er, hang on.
- Okay.

51:33.883 --> 51:36.278
Perhaps we should take a
bit of a tea break, eh?

51:36.302 --> 51:37.988
- Yeah.
- Obviously with

51:38.012 --> 51:40.324
- comrade Ted's permission here.
<i>- Da.</i>

51:40.348 --> 51:41.668
Any chance of
something stronger?

51:44.894 --> 51:46.246
Ow! Ooh.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.438
Are you all right?

51:47.730 --> 51:50.900
- I don't fancy being Fred without ginger.
- What?

51:51.442 --> 51:53.587
At the mash-up if you
can't flippin' dance.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.251
The last thing I want
to miss is the fun.

51:55.822 --> 51:58.407
- Worst case, maybe someone else...
- Not happening.

51:59.158 --> 52:00.427
- No.
- Why?

52:00.451 --> 52:02.346
She won't have time
to learn it, anyway.

52:02.370 --> 52:04.970
- She knows it better than I do.
- What difference does that make?

52:06.290 --> 52:08.000
No, it's all right. My treat.

52:08.167 --> 52:09.478
Thank you.

52:09.502 --> 52:10.878
It's my round.

52:11.879 --> 52:13.565
- What do you fancy?
- Yes, ladies.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.526
- Erm, a half of lager, please.
- Half a lager.

52:15.550 --> 52:17.486
- Okay, I'll have a gin and tonic.
- G and t.

52:17.510 --> 52:18.594
Sandra?

52:20.596 --> 52:21.722
What are you doing here?

52:22.598 --> 52:25.351
Just picking up a few souvenirs
from our life together.

52:26.811 --> 52:29.081
Come on, Mikey, let's go.

52:29.105 --> 52:31.875
That's right, run along, pretend
that nothing's happened.

52:31.899 --> 52:33.877
Let's not cause another
scene, Sandra.

52:33.901 --> 52:36.338
Heaven forbid. Perfectly all
right to destroy a marriage,

52:36.362 --> 52:38.173
not okay to talk about it.

52:38.197 --> 52:39.490
Home wrecker.

52:40.241 --> 52:42.052
Home maker, more like.

52:42.076 --> 52:44.054
You may look as
if you're in some

52:44.078 --> 52:49.518
washing powder commercial, but underneath,
you'll always be a grubby little bitch.

52:49.542 --> 52:50.894
Come on, Pamela, let's go.

52:50.918 --> 52:52.170
Come on, leave it.

52:53.713 --> 52:55.607
Whoa! Well, that's her told!

52:55.631 --> 52:57.091
This one's on the house.

52:57.258 --> 52:58.968
Well done!

52:59.927 --> 53:01.095
TouchÃ©.

53:27.788 --> 53:30.225
- Here she is!
- Sorry I'm late. I couldn't find my keys.

53:30.249 --> 53:32.102
- Come on, bif.
- Come on, you lot.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.407
- Are you sure you're up to this?
- Shake a leg! Crack on!

53:34.431 --> 53:37.559
- I better be.
- Yes. Move along, get inside.

53:39.675 --> 53:41.093
Go! Let's go!

53:41.552 --> 53:44.180
- You look nervous, Ted.
- I'm not nervous.

53:44.555 --> 53:47.701
- I'm bloody terrified.
- You'll be fine.

53:47.725 --> 53:48.935
I hope.

53:50.728 --> 53:51.938
Charlie, hang on.

53:53.147 --> 53:55.608
- Room for a small one?
- Yay!

53:57.568 --> 53:59.070
So, you changed your mind, lass.

53:59.278 --> 54:01.948
About a lot of things,
actually, Ted.

54:11.249 --> 54:13.501
âª <i>One two three o'clock
four o'clock rock! âª</i>

54:13.626 --> 54:15.544
<i>âª Five six seven o'clock,
eight o'clock rock!</i>

54:16.754 --> 54:19.090
<i>âª Nine ten eleven o'clock
twelve o'clock rock! âª</i>

55:55.561 --> 55:56.604
Hey!

56:21.837 --> 56:24.006
Gramps, look what
grandma sent me.

56:24.965 --> 56:26.342
It's gone viral.

56:27.468 --> 56:29.738
Tsk, she looks ridiculous.

56:29.762 --> 56:32.139
She's had her hair done.
It's knocked years off her.

56:34.141 --> 56:36.102
- Ooh!
- Sorry. Foot slipped.

56:41.690 --> 56:43.377
- Come on, bif!
- What?

56:43.401 --> 56:45.045
We're in danger of sobering up?

56:45.069 --> 56:46.320
Not on my watch.

56:46.862 --> 56:47.862
Try.

56:49.490 --> 56:51.009
Mmm, lethal.

56:51.033 --> 56:52.827
Isn't that the point?

56:53.327 --> 56:54.495
Yes.

57:02.253 --> 57:03.295
Charlie?

57:04.880 --> 57:06.507
Ah! Refreshments!

57:06.966 --> 57:08.092
Lovely!

57:08.759 --> 57:11.178
- Cheers, buddy!
- Right, that looks a bit tasty!

57:14.723 --> 57:16.410
Listen. Oh, look!
Listen, listen.

57:16.434 --> 57:18.578
Londonyouth14 commented,

57:18.602 --> 57:22.249
"they may be clapping, but
these old peeps are banging!"

57:22.273 --> 57:23.858
Whoo-hoo.

57:23.983 --> 57:25.252
In english, please.

57:25.276 --> 57:28.880
He's saying despite being
old, and a little frayed,

57:28.904 --> 57:31.407
these elderly people
are rather good.

57:33.117 --> 57:34.827
Who's gonna argue with that?

57:45.254 --> 57:46.380
Oh, hello.

57:46.672 --> 57:47.715
Hiya.

57:49.884 --> 57:51.260
I can't believe how...

57:51.969 --> 57:54.656
How homely your barge is.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.849
Mmm. You sound surprised.

57:57.224 --> 58:00.603
Well, I suppose I've never really
thought of a boat as a place to live.

58:00.728 --> 58:02.414
- Want to...
- Oh, yes, thanks.

58:02.438 --> 58:05.316
So how long have you had it?
Uh, her?

58:05.608 --> 58:07.193
Oh, it's...

58:07.776 --> 58:11.780
Coming up to about five years, I
think, since I sold the house.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.910
Everybody advised
me to, you know,

58:16.827 --> 58:20.372
stay on the property ladder, keep
my money in bricks and mortar.

58:20.831 --> 58:24.210
Yeah, they say the same thing to
me about my share of the sale.

58:25.628 --> 58:29.983
Well, you know, this country's obsessed
with home ownership, isn't it?

58:30.007 --> 58:31.007
Hmm.

58:31.717 --> 58:36.055
You know, I suppose it makes
people feel independent.

58:37.223 --> 58:38.641
But I see it differently.

58:40.017 --> 58:41.060
It's like a trap.

58:43.562 --> 58:48.567
Plus I, uh, I had to free
up a bit of capital.

58:51.237 --> 58:55.050
Well, I can certainly see the advantage
of being able to change your neighbours

58:55.074 --> 58:56.325
whenever you feel like it.

58:57.284 --> 58:59.995
I won't tell Ted you said that.

59:03.290 --> 59:04.667
So do you...

59:05.376 --> 59:08.295
See yourself living
like this forever?

59:09.213 --> 59:10.213
No.

59:11.006 --> 59:12.508
No, no.

59:13.008 --> 59:16.887
When the time's right, I plan
to take on a bigger adventure.

59:18.097 --> 59:20.474
You know, sail
across the channel.

59:21.433 --> 59:24.979
Slowly work my way down through
France to the camargue.

59:28.649 --> 59:29.984
That sounds idyllic.

59:30.693 --> 59:31.819
Yeah.

59:32.861 --> 59:35.322
As long as the pump on the
toilet doesn't pack up.

59:39.159 --> 59:40.411
Well, you know...

59:44.415 --> 59:45.415
Here.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.770
Can you remind me exactly
why we're doing this?

59:48.794 --> 59:50.188
Because swimming's good for you.

59:50.212 --> 59:51.940
Not in the middle of winter.

59:51.964 --> 59:53.066
Do shut up.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.675
Morning, pru, what's
the water like?

59:54.925 --> 59:57.678
Very cold. Not
that you'd notice.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:00.723
What's wrong with her?

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:03.058
We had a thing
once, didn't last.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:04.517
You...

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.080
You swing both ways?

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.582
Sure, sometimes.

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:11.567
You should try it. Doubles your
chances on Saturday night.

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:13.027
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:16.280
You and Charlie seem to
be getting on better.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:19.533
Well, he's... he's
a very good host.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:23.203
I noticed some guests got
more attention than others.

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:25.914
Last one in is a sissy.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.101
I'll count you in.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:31.253
Ten, nine, eight...

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.802
Are you afraid to warm up? You
should start moving. Come on!

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:44.475
Ow! Ooh.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:45.952
What's the matter?

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:47.954
My bloody back's
playing up again.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.855
- Ow!
- Serves you right.

01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:02.076
I can't believe you
still make these.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.954
I remember mum teaching us to
do them like it was yesterday.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:07.998
I think she regretted
it, though.

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:11.418
We used to drive her mad squabbling
over the glitter, didn't we?

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:17.299
My favourite Christmas treat was being
taken up to London to see the lights.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:21.029
Apart from that time when we
went to see Santa at selfridges,

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:23.722
and you peed yourself
when you sat on his knee.

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:27.309
I don't know who was
more upset, me or him.

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:29.687
Him probably.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:32.898
Shall we go tomorrow?

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.359
Huh? What? To see the lights?

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:36.651
Why not?

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:38.338
Okay.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.162
We could do a bit of shopping, 'cause
I need to get something for Luke.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:44.260
Hmm. All right, well, you do that
first and then I'll meet you later.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.204
- Wait, I'm gonna help you down.
- Help you down?

01:01:46.228 --> 01:01:47.988
- Or I'll go down.
- No, no, no, no. Come on.

01:01:57.715 --> 01:01:58.882
Hello, Sandra.

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:00.843
Oh, Charlie.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:05.448
Well, bif didn't say
you were coming.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:08.392
No, no, she didn't say you were
coming either, is she here?

01:02:09.852 --> 01:02:11.103
All right, um...

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.355
I'll, I'll just call her.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.065
All right, yeah, yeah.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.573
Sandra, hi.

01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:26.827
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:30.956
I ran into an old flame this afternoon,
I completely lost track of time.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.167
- Sorry, we're ready.
- What?

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:37.004
Didn't I mention
he was joining us?

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:40.567
Yeah. Listen, I've got to go.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.884
I'll see you back at home.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.385
Okay, bye.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:47.806
Standard! Standard!

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:50.309
She's not coming, is she?

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.059
Nope.

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:59.860
Well, it'd be a shame not to see
the lights... Now we're here.

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:01.361
Hmm?

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:05.783
- Right.
- Shall we? Yeah.

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.287
I don't know. What was
wrong with a satsuma

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.456
and a couple of walnuts
in a stocking?

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.690
I wanted to make up
for not being there.

01:03:39.233 --> 01:03:41.169
- Here, let me take that.
- Oh, thank you.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:42.861
Makes it a bit easier
for you, yeah.

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:47.634
Actually, this will be the first
year I won't see my grandson

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:49.076
open his stocking.

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:54.039
Christmas without any children
is going to feel very strange.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.168
Yeah. We tried for kids, but...

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:00.754
It just didn't happen.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:02.422
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:07.719
Oh, it's okay. No. In some ways, it...
It brought us closer together.

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:13.308
Anyway, Lilly always said I was enough
trouble to look after, you know?

01:04:43.774 --> 01:04:44.774
Yeah.

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:47.068
Tonight's been a trip
down memory Lane.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:51.722
I once stood on this corner with 300
girls queuing around the block.

01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:53.765
Yeah? For what?

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:57.352
Waiting to audition
for chorus line.

01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:00.981
You're a dark horse, aren't you?

01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:04.151
I had a feeling you
had a bit of form!

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:06.945
Did you make the cut?

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.174
Well, sort of. Erm, I got
through the second round

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:12.743
but then I discovered
I was pregnant.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:15.621
So, I embraced a different role.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:17.247
Motherhood.

01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:19.583
Ever fancy giving it another go?

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:23.813
Mike had a rather traditional
view of family life,

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:26.798
and being a west-end Wendy
didn't really fit into that.

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.262
That's your Van, isn't it?

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.473
Oh, no. No.

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:37.559
Hey, excuse me, mate,
I say, excuse me!

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.873
You've gotta be kidding me. I
mean, I've paid till 11 o'clock.

01:05:41.897 --> 01:05:44.500
Not to park on a motorbike
bay, you didn't.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:47.003
Yeah, but it's gotta be a
matter of inches, isn't it?

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:49.047
Come on, where's your
Christmas spirit?

01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:51.716
I drive a tow truck, mate,
not Santa's sleigh.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:54.218
How much is the fine, anyway?

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:57.639
Â£280 for moving it, plus the
parking ticket of 65 quid.

01:05:57.663 --> 01:06:00.391
Then, 40 quid a day
storage after that.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:04.771
Surely, in a situation like this, where
someone has made a genuine mistake...

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:07.023
You are breaking my heart, lady.

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:09.484
Ah, well, as a matter of
fact, I happen to be... ooh!

01:06:09.508 --> 01:06:11.385
Oi!

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:13.428
What the hell are you doing?

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:15.806
You coming?

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.307
Oi.

01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:21.645
Oi! You can't do that!

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:23.772
Grinch!

01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:25.356
Maniacs!

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:43.917
Okay. Keep your eye out
for the wanted posters.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:58.557
Thank you for the
door-to-door service.

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:13.238
- Goodnight, Charlie.
- Yeah, goodnight.

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:28.795
How long had you been
planning that little stunt?

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:30.356
At our stage of life,

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.341
why waste time waiting for things
to take their natural course?

01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:36.136
- So, did you?
- No!

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:41.701
He didn't try to kiss me or get his
leg over or anything else untoward.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.205
- He was a perfect gentleman.
- I need to have a word with him.

01:07:44.229 --> 01:07:45.814
No, you need to leave it alone.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.899
You've meddled quite enough,
thank you very much.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.150
Tell me you at least had fun.

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.612
Yes, I did.

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:57.115
Cheers.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:06.309
Before you go off and join the
queue for Santa's grotto,

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:08.213
I've got an early Christmas
present for you all.

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:10.545
We've been talent spotted.

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:13.900
The artistic director
of the Rome biennale

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:18.470
has invited us to perform, after
seeing our flash mob online.

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:23.390
We leave on the 10th of February,
for two nights, all expenses paid.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.081
We're going to Rome!

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.457
This hotel better
have satellite TV.

01:08:30.482 --> 01:08:32.710
I cannot miss arsenal
beating the spurs again.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:35.129
Oh, Ted, we're going to
Rome, city of lovers!

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:37.631
Exactly! The only question
you should ask yourself

01:08:37.656 --> 01:08:39.741
is whether you can
upgrade to a bigger bed!

01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:45.287
Come on, come on!
Go fast, go faster!

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.225
Go faster!

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:49.376
On three. One, two...

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.232
- We've all got one!
- Ooh, a little frame.

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:56.841
Hang on, let's have a look here.
Oh, here we are.

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:59.237
What's this? Oh...
okay, all right.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:00.470
All right, erm...

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:04.724
"Which, er, playwright was
terrified of Christmas?"

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:05.890
Don't know.

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.495
NoÃ«l coward!

01:09:07.519 --> 01:09:09.604
Ha-ha-ha!

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:11.439
Okay, okay, okay.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.401
"What do you get if you eat
Christmas decorations?"

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:16.444
Tinsel-itis.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.363
Bif, what have you got?

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.492
You know how they say, you
can't choose your family

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.386
- but you can choose your friends?
- Yeah.

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:27.997
Well, I couldn't have chosen
a better bunch than you lot.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.392
Aw!

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:32.627
And Sandra, over the
last few months,

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.714
I've realised I've
got my sister back.

01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:41.511
And that's the most precious Christmas
gift I could have wished for.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:43.971
Aw, good.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:47.017
- To family and friends.
- Yeah.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.227
- To family and friends.
- Cheers!

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.941
Now, does anybody fancy another
one of these rissoles?

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:57.068
Rissoles are cheap today!

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.302
<i>It's been a disaster from
start to finish, mum.</i>

01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:05.827
<i>It's the worst Christmas ever!</i>

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:08.121
- What happened?
<i>- Lunch was inedible.</i>

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.458
<i>It all came out of a packet and
Pamela still managed to burn the lot.</i>

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:14.395
<i>Luke wasn't even allowed
to play on her new carpet</i>

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:16.046
<i>with the remote-control
Jeep you bought.</i>

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:19.674
<i>And then, she and dad got drunk on
mulled wine and had a blazing row.</i>

01:10:20.342 --> 01:10:21.676
So the day got better then?

01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:24.054
<i>- Mum!</i>
- Sorry, sorry.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.283
I'll take some of
these pies back home.

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:29.118
- Oh, that's a good idea.
- Shame to let them go to waste!

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:31.162
Can you pick up a couple
of glasses from in there?

01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:33.480
Yeah, let's get this
carnage cleared up.

01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:35.357
Shh, shh, shh, she's asleep.

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.320
She's out for the count.

01:10:42.434 --> 01:10:44.634
To be honest, I was really
dreading Christmas this year,

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:47.887
but it has been one of the
most enjoyable I can remember.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:48.995
Yeah, me too.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:50.538
Yeah, I'm...

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.434
Although, I'll tell you,

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:56.698
I'll be pleased not to have to listen to
any more Christmas tunes until next year.

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:02.467
What, er... what music
are you into, then?

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.302
Er...

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:06.352
This sounds terrible, but
I'm not really sure.

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:11.142
Mike used to play drive time compilations
in the car, but we didn't really

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.019
have any in the house.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.772
How can a couple not have
music in their lives?

01:11:16.648 --> 01:11:19.109
I mean, the pressure on
conversation is insane.

01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.948
Now that's more like it.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.124
Well, what, don't
you know this one?

01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:35.833
No.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:40.046
Yeah, it's, er, it's
called the Harlem shake.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:45.027
- Come on, give it a go.
- No, I'll just do this lot.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:47.812
Come on, come on, come on, they're
not going to go anywhere, are they?

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:50.190
Come on, come on, right, so
it's all about the hips, right?

01:11:50.214 --> 01:11:52.600
It's in the hips and
the shoulders, so...

01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:55.312
Right, so hips...

01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:59.792
- I don't know what kind...
- Come on, what's going on down here?

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.896
I thought you were supposed
to be a pro or something.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.480
I mean, you look like you're trying
to crack a walnut down there!

01:12:04.504 --> 01:12:05.715
Thank you! Charming!

01:12:05.739 --> 01:12:07.819
Come on, you're gonna have
to loosen up a little bit.

01:12:07.843 --> 01:12:09.386
Shake it out a little
bit, all right?

01:12:09.678 --> 01:12:10.678
Yeah...

01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:13.371
Oh, now you look like you're
trying to hump the wall!

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.083
Okay, all right.

01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:30.367
Are you all right?
What's the matter?

01:12:30.391 --> 01:12:33.353
Can you get my inhaler?
It's in my cardigan.

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:35.893
All right?

01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:38.646
- There you go.
- Thanks.

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:41.399
I didn't know you had asthma.

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:44.778
Okay?

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:47.739
Mmm... it flares up
from time to time.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:50.408
It's fine now.

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:52.994
I'm sorry for being
such a bad host.

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:54.930
Falling asleep on the job.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:13:00.043
Don't worry about it. Don't apologise.
You left me in very capable hands.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.128
I'm fine now.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.672
- All right?
- Mmm.

01:13:13.098 --> 01:13:14.224
Oh...

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.810
Use your inhaler!

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:20.230
Oh.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.357
Mmm...

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.662
- Morning.
- Mmm.

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.664
Oh, I'm starving.

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:41.918
What are all those?

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.881
They're for the asthma.

01:13:50.552 --> 01:13:51.719
I'm dying.

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:55.857
There had better be a
good punchline to this.

01:13:57.434 --> 01:14:00.103
How about stage 4 lung cancer?

01:14:03.523 --> 01:14:06.109
They referred me
to an oncologist,

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:09.529
when they couldn't make out
why my back wasn't mending.

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:15.201
And then I got the result of a
scan, a couple of weeks ago.

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:23.668
Why didn't you tell me?

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:28.089
Well, I needed the time, just to
get my head around everything.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:36.264
So when do you start chemo?

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:40.643
I'm not going to put myself
through all of that.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:42.729
You have to.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:45.648
No, I don't.

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.929
I don't want any tears, Charlie.

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:20.767
You aren't getting any.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:23.685
Oh.

01:15:25.522 --> 01:15:27.357
Purely medicinal purposes.

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.865
- Mmm.
- Can I have a puff?

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.544
You're the only
people I'm telling.

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:52.674
I couldn't bear everyone else to start
treating me like a sick old woman.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.511
What about Jackie and Ted?

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:03.059
What I need most are
things to look forward to.

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:07.105
And if I tell everyone,
it will spoil Rome.

01:16:07.939 --> 01:16:09.357
You're not still
thinking of going?

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:10.858
No.

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:13.236
I thought I'd just sit
here and wait to die.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.426
<i>- Buongiorno, madame.
- Buongiorno.</i>

01:16:46.686 --> 01:16:48.163
Did you know she
could speak Italian?

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.040
- Not a clue!
- Okay, everybody, let's get

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:53.067
our glad rags on. It's called
the eternal city for a reason.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.921
- I'll take it.
- It's all right, Sandra.

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:57.655
I've got cancer, I'm
not an amputee!

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:13.796
Stunning!

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:18.509
- Thank you.
- Oh, I meant the view.

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:21.864
- Oh, yes.
- No, no, I'm only joking.

01:17:21.888 --> 01:17:23.014
Of course, I am.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:26.893
Oh, no, you look <i>bellissimo.</i>

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:32.774
Look, Sandra,

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:34.942
I know it's difficult...

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:38.488
But bif's made her choice.

01:17:40.073 --> 01:17:42.241
I'm trying to be strong for her,

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.287
but we're cut from
different cloth.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:49.707
You two are more similar
than you realise.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:05.074
Ah, it's a good job we don't
have a bloody matinÃ©e tomorrow.

01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:06.993
We do.

01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:10.580
What can you do? <i>Signore!</i>

01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:14.917
That's exactly what
the doctor ordered.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:17.128
I've eaten so much, I think
I might need a doctor!

01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:21.674
Oh, I love this city.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.570
And it seems to love you.

01:19:24.594 --> 01:19:27.722
I first came here in 1969,

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.326
when I hitch-hiked across
Europe with Polly Watkins.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.790
- I don't remember that.
- No, well, you were still at school.

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:36.415
By day, I was a chambermaid,

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:39.084
and by night, I was
Audrey hepburn,

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.611
looking for my own
<i>Roman holiday.</i>

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:45.948
That's when I met him.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.202
Which "him" is this?

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:51.913
His name was gino.

01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:56.059
A group of us used to hang out
at his parents' restaurant

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:59.754
after closing time and eat huge
feasts of all the leftovers.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:03.424
He called me his
little <i>pattumiera.</i>

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.843
- Huh?
- Little dustbin.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:08.405
Because I'd eat
anything he cooked.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:10.306
He had a way with words, then.

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:12.683
He had a way with most things.

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:15.435
Look at this.

01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:18.397
We were madly in love,

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.234
and planned to spend
our lives together.

01:20:22.944 --> 01:20:26.280
His parents gave
us their blessing.

01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.117
And then,

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:32.662
two weeks before I was
supposed to move here,

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:37.875
he was killed in a
stupid car cash.

01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.377
No.

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:44.841
And when I finally got
myself back in one piece,

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:48.678
I vowed I wouldn't ever let
myself feel that pain again.

01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:51.264
And I haven't.

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:53.891
But you know what?

01:20:56.978 --> 01:20:59.355
Being back here now,

01:21:00.106 --> 01:21:01.274
I regret it.

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.234
Regret what?

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:05.736
Never falling in love again.

01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:08.906
Oi, come on, you two!

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:10.867
Big day tomorrow.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:14.328
Time to go up the wooden
hill to bedfordshire.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:16.122
Come on.

01:21:17.665 --> 01:21:19.458
- Come on.
- Yeah.

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:36.934
Oh...

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:39.079
Hello, Nicola.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:41.439
Is everything all right?

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:42.690
<i>Yes, great.</i>

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:45.276
<i>Dad's left Pamela. He's
going to call you.</i>

01:21:47.445 --> 01:21:48.905
Really? What's he expecting?

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:52.509
Me to come running back
now he's had his fun.

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:54.344
<i>I don't know. Will you
at least speak to him?</i>

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:55.578
It's not that simple.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.496
Besides,

01:21:58.873 --> 01:22:00.374
I'm in Rome.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:03.044
<i>Rome? What are you doing there?</i>

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:04.921
I'm dancing.

01:22:05.713 --> 01:22:06.881
At a festival.

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:09.258
<i>You don't like dancing.</i>

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.554
There are a lot of things I forgot I
liked whilst I was with your father.

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:18.434
Listen, darling, I've got to go,

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:21.455
'cause we're on
stage in about...

01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:22.980
Oh, shit!

01:22:37.078 --> 01:22:38.438
<i>- Buongiorno, madame.
- Buongiorno.</i>

01:22:38.462 --> 01:22:40.702
- Are you enjoying your morning?
- Oh, lovely, thank you!

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:46.587
What do you think, Charlie?

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:49.090
Not bad for a warm-up act.

01:22:49.382 --> 01:22:53.094
Sorry. Where the hell is Sandra?
We're on in five.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.352
How's your head?

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.355
Thumping in time with the beat.

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.693
All right, guys? Come.

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:27.211
I'm here.

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:30.339
- Oh! Thank goodness!
- Oh, here she is!

01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:35.011
Oh, here she is. Okay,
guys, it's show time.

01:23:35.136 --> 01:23:37.698
Just remember, if you enjoy
it, they'll enjoy it.

01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:39.849
- You'll be fabulous.
- Break a leg, everyone.

01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:25.264
Well done.

01:26:31.312 --> 01:26:32.313
Bravo!

01:26:34.315 --> 01:26:35.649
Bravo!

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:39.278
Whoo!

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.031
Bravo!

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:46.202
Bravo!

01:26:54.374 --> 01:26:55.854
- Look out.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:26:55.878 --> 01:26:56.921
Whoa!

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:02.027
Now, you sure you don't want me
to stay in with you tonight?

01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:04.696
We could order up room
service, anything you fancy?

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.846
Definitely not.

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:09.642
All the excitement has taken it out of me.
I just need to rest.

01:27:10.768 --> 01:27:12.561
You go and enjoy
yourself with Charlie.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:14.521
Mmm.

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:20.277
Promise me, you won't make
the same mistake I did.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:23.697
I'm not sure I could...

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.618
Ever trust anyone again, really.

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:34.375
Sometimes, you just need
to take a leap of faith.

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:49.098
Yes, bullseye! Right.

01:27:49.515 --> 01:27:54.079
"First one guarantees that
you will return to Rome."

01:27:54.103 --> 01:27:55.688
Okay, and what's this one for?

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:59.191
No, I'm not telling you
till you've thrown it.

01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:07.366
Yes! Bosh! Right. Yeah, right.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:10.619
It says that the second one...

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:14.456
Leads to new romance.

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:19.211
What's the third one for?

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:24.466
It's... marriage.

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:31.932
One sec. Sandra, erm...

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.436
There's something I need...

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:38.523
Well, you're not going to
tell me you're married?

01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:45.321
What...

01:28:47.197 --> 01:28:50.677
Yeah, Lilly's in the advanced
stage of Alzheimer's.

01:28:50.701 --> 01:28:52.341
I thought you told me
your wife had died.

01:28:52.365 --> 01:28:54.117
No, no, I never said that.

01:28:54.747 --> 01:28:57.642
She's been in a care home
for the past five years.

01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:59.209
She doesn't recognise me.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:03.315
She doesn't remember anything
about our life together any more.

01:29:03.339 --> 01:29:04.548
Does bif know?

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:08.886
- Yeah.
- Well, why wouldn't she have told me?

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.949
Well, perhaps she wanted
us both to be happy again.

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:16.226
Oh, I... I can't do this.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:22.417
Sandra, Sandra, Sandra,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:24.401
Please, please,
listen, just listen.

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:29.823
I didn't imagine for a minute

01:29:30.199 --> 01:29:31.742
that I would be able to move on.

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:35.504
- But then you come into my life...
- I wouldn't have dropped my guard

01:29:35.528 --> 01:29:36.654
if I'd known the truth.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:38.665
But I promise you,

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:41.335
I didn't set out to deceive you.

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:44.546
I've grown really
fond of you, Charlie.

01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:47.674
But after what
I've been through,

01:29:48.175 --> 01:29:50.177
I can't be the other woman.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:52.971
Sorry.

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:47.109
Bif.

01:30:58.704 --> 01:31:00.747
Jackie, was bif at breakfast?

01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:03.309
I'm not sure but I'm not
at my best this morning.

01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:06.563
Ted and I stayed up until
3:00 testing various grappas.

01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:09.348
- Do you want me to go and check?
- No, no, she's probably just having

01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:10.915
a lie in, it's fine.

01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:18.765
- Thank you, <i>grazie.
- Prego.</i>

01:31:20.184 --> 01:31:21.226
Morning.

01:31:22.186 --> 01:31:24.897
Did you hear me? I've
been knocking for ages.

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:29.443
Come on, we're gonna miss
the best of the day.

01:31:31.028 --> 01:31:32.028
Hmm?

01:31:39.244 --> 01:31:40.454
Oh...

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:44.291
No.

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:49.588
Oh...

01:31:52.466 --> 01:31:53.466
Bif.

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:39.906
Growing up with bif
as my big sister,

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:44.601
I inherited my very own
alternative life coach.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:47.539
I learned the ways of the world

01:32:47.563 --> 01:32:50.232
through her example, and
as you can imagine,

01:32:51.108 --> 01:32:53.110
it wasn't all textbook stuff.

01:32:55.946 --> 01:33:00.492
The one thing she wasn't able to teach
me was how to say her name properly,

01:33:01.702 --> 01:33:04.246
which is how she ended
up being known as bif,

01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:08.083
due to my inability to
pronounce Elizabeth.

01:33:12.296 --> 01:33:13.755
My biggest regret

01:33:14.423 --> 01:33:16.717
is that over the
years we grew apart,

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:20.387
and it was only when we
reconnected last summer,

01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:23.807
that I realised quite
how much I missed...

01:33:25.726 --> 01:33:27.227
Her guiding hand.

01:33:31.565 --> 01:33:33.984
Her lust for life
was contagious.

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:38.464
And being around her again
forced me to wake up

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:40.282
and start making the most of it.

01:33:48.624 --> 01:33:50.000
My sister was loyal,

01:33:50.876 --> 01:33:52.002
fun,

01:33:52.628 --> 01:33:53.879
challenging,

01:33:54.838 --> 01:33:58.675
mischievous, generous, loving
and stubborn as a mule.

01:34:00.927 --> 01:34:05.432
She quite simply refused to be defined
by convention, or more recently,

01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:07.059
illness.

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:13.440
She was truly a one-off.

01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:20.155
The world is going to be a
duller place without you, bif.

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:48.892
Last one in is a sissy.

01:35:10.706 --> 01:35:12.626
- You did very well.
- Are you coming afterwards?

01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:14.234
Yes, I'll see you back up there.

01:35:22.968 --> 01:35:24.052
Sandra.

01:35:25.095 --> 01:35:26.095
I, er...

01:35:26.722 --> 01:35:27.806
Can we talk?

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:30.326
About what?

01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:31.350
Mum.

01:35:33.353 --> 01:35:35.272
- About how you're coping...
- Mum?

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:39.614
- I...
- I'm going to go ahead and get the car.

01:35:39.638 --> 01:35:40.723
Okay.

01:35:43.196 --> 01:35:45.341
- You look shattered.
- I'm fine.

01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:46.575
No, you're not.

01:35:47.534 --> 01:35:48.827
We're not.

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:51.496
Please come home, mum.

01:35:52.831 --> 01:35:55.292
I want to have you with
us for your big birthday.

01:35:57.085 --> 01:35:58.962
There's nothing keeping
you here, any more.

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:01.923
I'll see you at the top.

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:12.976
Sandra.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.397
- I know there's no point in...
- No. None at all, Mike.

01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:20.960
I know I behaved like
a complete idiot.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:22.420
Whatever gave you that idea.

01:36:22.444 --> 01:36:27.240
But sometimes the wrong turns in
life bring us to the right place.

01:36:29.701 --> 01:36:33.038
I'd do anything, and everything

01:36:33.663 --> 01:36:37.959
to take away the pain and humiliation
my stupidity has caused you.

01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:41.397
I realise now how much
I really do love you,

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:42.798
have always loved you.

01:36:44.216 --> 01:36:48.094
Give me... us, a second chance,

01:36:49.179 --> 01:36:52.808
and I promise, I won't take
you for granted ever again.

01:36:58.730 --> 01:36:59.730
Hmm.

01:37:06.363 --> 01:37:07.781
Is that the lot, Sandra?

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:10.158
Yep, that's it.

01:37:11.785 --> 01:37:14.013
Well, the charity shops will
not know what hit them.

01:37:14.037 --> 01:37:16.157
Half of most of it came from
there in the first place.

01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:24.506
- Good luck, Sandra.
- Thank you.

01:37:31.763 --> 01:37:33.682
I really do hope it
works out for you.

01:37:35.392 --> 01:37:37.269
Well, everyone deserves
a second chance.

01:37:38.144 --> 01:37:39.563
Even my husband.

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:42.524
And I hope he knows
how lucky he is.

01:38:59.351 --> 01:39:01.978
Welcome home, love.

01:39:03.647 --> 01:39:05.458
I went to marks and did
a bit of a food shop.

01:39:05.482 --> 01:39:08.377
I got the veal and ham
pie we like for tea.

01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:10.070
Er, I couldn't find your pickle.

01:39:10.362 --> 01:39:12.781
As you know, I'm a bit of
a stranger to the larder.

01:39:13.198 --> 01:39:15.033
I had a whisk round
with the hoover.

01:39:15.325 --> 01:39:18.078
But I fear my efforts
will not pass muster.

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.923
<i>Dear Sandra,</i>

01:40:12.966 --> 01:40:17.178
<i>I wanted to let you know that
Lilly has sadly passed away.</i>

01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:21.433
<i>Now that she has reached
the end of her journey,</i>

01:40:22.308 --> 01:40:25.979
<i>it feels like the right time to
embark on a new one of my own.</i>

01:40:27.564 --> 01:40:30.668
<i>I'm setting sail for
France on the 15th,</i>

01:40:30.692 --> 01:40:34.154
<i>from my moorings in
Paddington to make the tide.</i>

01:40:35.697 --> 01:40:38.033
<i>So if you're life is
still without music,</i>

01:40:39.117 --> 01:40:41.536
<i>and you fancy a decent
croissant or two...</i>

01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:51.921
Give it to me.

01:40:52.756 --> 01:40:53.923
Stop it.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:56.384
Slower.

01:40:58.344 --> 01:41:02.390
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
and those of you who are undecided.

01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:07.353
We're gathered here today to celebrate
the birthday of my wonderful wife.

01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:11.191
Like a fine wine, she only
grows better with time,

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:15.087
and I'm looking forward to sharing
many more vintage years with her.

01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:16.946
- Aw!
- Happy birthday, my love.

01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:21.326
âª <i>Happy birthday to you âª</i>

01:41:21.659 --> 01:41:24.829
<i>âª happy birthday to you âª</i>

01:41:24.996 --> 01:41:26.057
Come on.

01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:29.167
<i>âª Happy birthday, dear Sandra âª</i>

01:41:29.793 --> 01:41:34.422
<i>âª happy birthday to you âª</i>

01:41:41.846 --> 01:41:43.890
God, look what
Gloria is wearing.

01:41:45.141 --> 01:41:49.646
Do you remember that
time in claridge's when,

01:41:50.605 --> 01:41:52.440
when we told her to
get the sommelier,

01:41:53.108 --> 01:41:55.610
and she tried to order
two bottles of it?

01:41:57.570 --> 01:41:58.613
Do you remember?

01:41:59.072 --> 01:42:01.741
Oh, was it claridge's?
My memory.

01:42:03.368 --> 01:42:05.221
Granny, can you teach
me how to dance?

01:42:05.245 --> 01:42:07.247
Oh, I'm in the
middle of a story!

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:09.249
Of course, I can, darling.
Come on.

01:42:09.499 --> 01:42:10.542
Oh!

01:42:14.003 --> 01:42:16.673
- I want you to take your shoes off.
- Okay.

01:42:21.094 --> 01:42:23.138
Now, I want you to put
your feet on mine.

01:42:28.143 --> 01:42:30.895
This is really boring.
Can't we do gangnam style?

01:42:31.688 --> 01:42:32.897
Oh, I don't think I know that.

01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:35.371
Wait, wait, wait, stay
there, stay there.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.570
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:43:18.735 --> 01:43:21.404
You're making a spectacle of yourself,
Sandra. Everybody's looking.

01:43:22.238 --> 01:43:24.425
Who fucking cares?

01:43:24.449 --> 01:43:27.035
I do. You've had too much to
drink, let's get you a coffee.

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.995
Come on. Come on.

01:43:29.871 --> 01:43:32.290
The last thing I need
is a bloody coffee.

01:43:33.583 --> 01:43:36.294
I'm stone-cold sober, Mike.

01:43:38.004 --> 01:43:41.341
You know, I didn't think anything could
be worse than being betrayed by you.

01:43:41.841 --> 01:43:47.138
But actually, I've realised I've spent
the last 35 years betraying myself.

01:43:49.807 --> 01:43:53.394
I want you to remember that
granny loves you very much.

01:43:57.607 --> 01:43:59.317
I love you, too, darling.

01:44:00.235 --> 01:44:02.820
- I'll keep in touch.
- Mum, where are you going?

01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:07.617
To see the world. It's
bigger than this.

01:44:26.261 --> 01:44:27.804
Charlie, where'd
you want the bait?

01:44:28.263 --> 01:44:31.057
Yeah, just there by the
hatch, mate, thanks.

01:44:40.275 --> 01:44:42.527
Hey, Ted, if you change
your mind, mate,

01:44:43.069 --> 01:44:45.154
plenty of room in
here for a stowaway.

01:44:45.363 --> 01:44:48.783
Aye, if it wasn't for the grand kids,
I'd love to be your cabin boy.

01:44:53.788 --> 01:44:56.332
Hey, why don't you give
Jackie a ring, eh?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.477
Ask her out for a drink.

01:44:58.501 --> 01:45:00.729
- You think so?
- Mind you, if it goes anywhere,

01:45:00.753 --> 01:45:02.630
make sure you get a prenup.

01:45:04.549 --> 01:45:05.925
I'm going to get out here.

01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:28.530
Sandra?

01:45:28.865 --> 01:45:29.865
What are you doing here?

01:45:30.074 --> 01:45:32.368
- Where's Charlie?
- He left a few minutes ago.

01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:33.577
Oh!

01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:35.245
Wrong way.

01:45:35.621 --> 01:45:37.999
Oh. Wrong way. Thank you.

01:45:47.425 --> 01:45:48.425
Charlie.

01:45:50.219 --> 01:45:51.346
Charlie!

01:46:37.683 --> 01:46:38.684
Charlie!

01:46:39.769 --> 01:46:40.937
Sandra!

01:46:41.437 --> 01:46:42.855
I didn't think you'd come!

01:46:43.398 --> 01:46:45.316
Neither did I, but you're right,

01:46:45.775 --> 01:46:48.569
it's impossible to find a
decent croissant in surrey.

01:46:50.113 --> 01:46:51.239
What are you doing?

01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:54.992
I'm taking a leap of faith!
