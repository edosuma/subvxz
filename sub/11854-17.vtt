WEBVTT

00:06.458 --> 00:07.792
(male announcer)
'The ball's thrown in'

00:07.875 --> 00:09.333
'and it's stolen away'

00:09.417 --> 00:11.583
(male #1)
'We can do it!'

00:11.667 --> 00:13.417
'Hold timeout please.'

00:15.291 --> 00:16.333
(male announcer)
'Bang on!'

00:16.417 --> 00:18.333
Come on, guys,
over here now.

00:18.417 --> 00:19.583
Listen up, listen up.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.208
We're down one
and we need a score.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.625
You boys do what I tell you,
you'll be State Champions!

00:23.709 --> 00:25.709
I want the ball
in Herman's hands.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.625
The rest of you guys, just clear
out of his way, you understand?

00:28.709 --> 00:31.834
Alright, bring it in. Saints
on three. One, two, three!

00:31.917 --> 00:33.208
(together)
Saints!

00:33.291 --> 00:34.333
Herman!

00:35.750 --> 00:39.083
Put us on your
back
and get us a win.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.792
Let's go, Herman baby!

00:40.875 --> 00:43.500
(male #2)
'Herman, Herman,
do your uncle right, baby.'

00:43.583 --> 00:46.625
Please, Lord, give young Herman
the strength to do me right.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.959
'Please! Come on, Herman.
Come on, baby.'

00:49.041 --> 00:51.166
'Let's do it, baby. Come on.'

01:02.291 --> 01:03.250
Yes!

01:16.750 --> 01:18.208
Yes! Yes!

01:20.709 --> 01:24.500
- Philly Tech wins.
- 'We're number one, baby!'

01:24.583 --> 01:30.750
(male announcer)
'Your new 1987 Pennsylvania Boys
next school State Champions'

01:30.834 --> 01:34.417
'are the Saints
from Philly Tech High!'

02:24.333 --> 02:26.959
You figure 6:00 a.m.'s the
right
time to start the day, boss?

02:27.041 --> 02:28.583
These guys have been
here for an hour,
Lil.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.250
You ever hear of Herman Lester?

02:32.333 --> 02:33.750
No.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.041
He's only the best
basketball
player who ever lived.

02:36.125 --> 02:38.000
- Yeah?
- And died.

02:38.083 --> 02:42.917
He was murdered on a playground
court in 1987. Never solved.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.083
So what are we doing here?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.500
You see the kid with the ball?

02:50.083 --> 02:51.250
That's Herman's son.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.250
(male #3)
'That's it, baby. That's
it.'

02:58.458 --> 03:00.625
Bob, ball never
touches the floor.

03:00.709 --> 03:01.834
Hey, John..

03:01.917 --> 03:04.583
And make the layup now.
Let's go.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.250
- John.
- Coach.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.959
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.834
This is Detective Rush.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.834
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.083
Look, look, watch this.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.041
Doesn't have Herman's
size
but...more range.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.458
And the same confidence.
I tell you, John.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.500
It's like coaching Herman
all over again.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.083
Hey, Ray! Come here!

03:25.166 --> 03:27.750
(John)
'Let's have him walk us
through this phone call he
got.'

03:27.834 --> 03:29.458
Some kind of threat?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.875
Ray, these are Philadelphia
Police. Gonna help us out.

03:31.959 --> 03:34.208
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.125
- Hi, Ray.
- Hi.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.458
Wanna tell us about
the phone call you got?

03:38.542 --> 03:39.667
Not much to it.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.542
I'm home, pick up
the phone and hear

03:41.625 --> 03:43.375
if I play Friday
night,
I'm gonna get

03:43.458 --> 03:45.458
the screwdriver
just like my
dad.

03:45.542 --> 03:48.709
- Screwdriver?
- It was the murder weapon.

03:50.375 --> 03:53.291
So...what's Friday night?

03:55.208 --> 03:56.583
State Championship.

03:59.250 --> 04:03.000
Uh, no idea who it was,
male, female, young, old?

04:03.083 --> 04:05.750
Male. Can't say about the rest.

04:05.834 --> 04:08.375
Ray, are you havin'
any problems in school?

04:08.458 --> 04:10.417
Any issues on or off the court?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.375
Nah. Things are cool.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.667
- Okay, Ray. Thanks.
- Back out there.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.667
I need him in the lineup Friday.

04:20.750 --> 04:21.834
Do you really think this threat

04:21.917 --> 04:23.667
is connected to Herman's murder?

04:24.917 --> 04:26.750
Well, the kid's
a phenom like his
dad.

04:26.834 --> 04:30.083
'They both lead their teams
to the State Championship.'

04:30.166 --> 04:33.166
Herman gets murdered.
Now Ray gets this death
threat.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.500
Enough connection for me.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.000
We'll check with
the phone company

04:36.083 --> 04:37.750
see if we can trace
where the call came
from.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.291
Alright.

04:40.417 --> 04:42.834
And pull Herman Lester's case.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.417
I wish you'd have eaten more.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.375
- I ate all the melon.
- Yeah.

05:20.458 --> 05:23.375
Yeah, and you made sure the
home fries didn't go to
waste.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.166
I like being out here.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.792
- In the cold.
- Hmm.

05:29.875 --> 05:30.917
Hmm.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.834
- I'll get you a cab.
- Hmm.

05:39.542 --> 05:40.709
What? What is it?

05:40.792 --> 05:44.750
Uh, there's a giant behind you.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.083
What?

05:46.166 --> 05:48.625
Well, look for yourself.

05:48.709 --> 05:51.166
(Will)
'Yeah. Look for yourself.'

05:51.250 --> 05:53.083
Oh. Hey, man.

05:53.166 --> 05:55.083
What-what are you doing here?

05:55.166 --> 05:57.083
Getting my coffee.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.750
What are you doing here?

05:58.834 --> 06:01.083
Uh, uh.. Just, uh, coffee.

06:03.375 --> 06:06.000
- Will Jeffries.
- Elisa.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.417
Sorry. Bonehead.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.166
We work together.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.667
Pleasure to meet you.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.375
See you at work, Scotty.

06:12.458 --> 06:13.834
(Scotty)
'Yeah.'

06:18.500 --> 06:20.875
So, uh, a cab, right?

06:27.834 --> 06:31.625
Guess, uh, Jeffries is
kind of a giant, ain't he?

06:33.417 --> 06:35.208
Probably should've said big.

06:37.250 --> 06:40.250
If Herman Lester had lived,
folks around here would

06:40.333 --> 06:43.083
think of Dr. J as
just another player.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.625
Oh, come on, boss.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.834
The good doctor would jump
so high he could pick a
dollar

06:46.917 --> 06:48.208
off the top of the backboards.

06:48.291 --> 06:51.291
Scotty, Herman
Lester
would leave change.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.792
Whatever Herman did,
he returned to Earth

06:54.875 --> 06:57.291
and caught the wrong end
of a Phillips screwdriver.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.250
Yeah. Pierced once
through the heart.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.458
And bled out like a mere mortal
on the court at Players' Park.

07:02.542 --> 07:03.583
Suspects?

07:03.667 --> 07:05.750
One, Billy Berkenpass,
a teammate.

07:05.834 --> 07:08.000
Good player in his
own right, but no Herman.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.709
Says here that was the problem.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.000
Berkenpass hated playing
second fiddle to Herman.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.500
Attitude got him
booted off the team.

07:13.583 --> 07:16.000
He missed the State Championship
same night Herman died.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.583
Yeah, he lost out in love too.

07:17.667 --> 07:21.375
Tanya Williams dumped Berkenpass
for Herman a few months earlier.

07:21.458 --> 07:22.834
Double motive.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.583
Footnote says maybe
Herman was iced by a bagman

07:25.667 --> 07:27.125
from a top 20 school?

07:27.208 --> 07:28.375
Sounds like urban legend.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.875
Yeah, smart money
was on Berkenpass.

07:29.959 --> 07:32.166
On top of everything
else, 20 kids saw him

07:32.250 --> 07:34.333
confront Herman at an
after-game party that night

07:34.417 --> 07:35.709
So why didn't he go down?

07:35.792 --> 07:37.375
No hard evidence
and he had an alibi.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.583
Time of the murder he claimed
he was home with his dad.

07:39.667 --> 07:43.041
Oh, dad vouching for you
ain't exactly airtight.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.583
Are we sure this job is
connected to Ray's death
threat?

07:45.667 --> 07:47.542
Well, seems like it is,
especially since the threat

07:47.625 --> 07:50.792
was made from a payphone
at the City Center Rec.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.291
Yeah, and guess who
hoops it up there

07:52.375 --> 07:54.250
every day over lunch hour?

07:54.333 --> 07:55.625
Berkenpass.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.125
(Will)
'Your son says he was with
you'

07:58.208 --> 08:00.041
the night Herman Lester
was killed.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.709
Yeah, we sat in front of
the tube till 3:00 a.m.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.625
You always watch TV that late?

08:04.709 --> 08:08.333
No, just that night.
"Good, Bad and the Ugly" was
on.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.875
Got a pretty
specific memory there.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.500
I've only been asked the
question about 90 times.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.834
Hey, hey, hey.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.917
No reason for you to touch that.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.417
So that night Billy
must've been pretty steamed

08:26.500 --> 08:27.917
after what happened to him.

08:28.000 --> 08:28.917
What do you mean?

08:29.000 --> 08:29.959
Him getting kicked off the team

08:30.041 --> 08:31.625
missing the big game.

08:31.709 --> 08:33.000
My kid got screwed.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.875
Plus, Herman taking up
with his ex-girlfriend.

08:34.959 --> 08:36.000
Tanya, right?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.333
Got screwed twice.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.083
He was better off
losing the girl.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.709
You didn't like her?

08:41.792 --> 08:43.583
I don't like any
girls in the
picture.

08:43.667 --> 08:47.041
Women weaken legs.
That's not good for
basketball.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.500
Look, it's admirable

08:49.583 --> 08:50.750
you defending your boy
all this time--

08:50.834 --> 08:52.333
Yeah, somebody had to.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.667
Within 24 hours, you
cops
were all over that boy

08:54.750 --> 08:56.500
for the murder of Lester.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.917
The kid was 17-years-old.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.417
I guess you didn't get enough.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.250
'Cause now you're at it again.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.959
Why are you asking about Herman?

09:14.041 --> 09:16.250
(Rush)
'We're reopening
his murder case.'

09:16.333 --> 09:18.250
No, leave it
alone.
Leave it.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.917
Tanya, we think looking
at Herman's case

09:20.000 --> 09:21.166
will help
your son's situation.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.208
How?

09:22.291 --> 09:24.458
Tanya, let Uncle Freddie
handle this.

09:24.542 --> 09:26.250
I'm the man who raised Herman

09:26.333 --> 09:28.166
and I been like
a father to Ray too.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.542
So tell me. How will it help?

09:32.375 --> 09:34.959
We think Billy Berkenpass
may have made the call to Ray.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.208
That's the dude who killed dad?

09:36.291 --> 09:37.625
We don't know that.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.917
Oh, that White boy
was so jealous of your pop!

09:40.000 --> 09:42.083
Freddie, don't start.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.542
Ray, you recognize this guy?

09:44.625 --> 09:47.667
Oh, man! That's the ghost.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.083
The ghost?

09:49.166 --> 09:52.000
When I'm out playing pickup,
he's there watching.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.792
White dude looks at me funny.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.208
How long is this been going on?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.333
Ever since I started
making a name for
myself.

09:58.417 --> 10:01.834
- Maybe about two years ago.
- The ghost ever approach you?

10:01.917 --> 10:03.000
- Nah.
- 'That's it!'

10:03.083 --> 10:04.583
Uncle Freddie's stepping in.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.125
Ray ain't playing Friday.

10:06.208 --> 10:07.625
You said there'd
be security, right?

10:07.709 --> 10:09.333
- Right.
- No, no, no! No risk!

10:09.417 --> 10:11.458
The boy is going league,
understand?

10:11.542 --> 10:13.041
League?

10:13.125 --> 10:15.875
NBA pro scouts already
got Ray marked down

10:15.959 --> 10:17.500
as a first-round
draft choice.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.083
Ray hasn't decided
where he's going next year

10:19.166 --> 10:20.583
Freddie, so shut it.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.834
Hopefully, we clear this
whole thing before the game.

10:22.917 --> 10:25.041
Are you sure
Billy called my son?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.750
Not a hundred percent.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.917
I never believed
he killed Herman.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
(Lilly)
'No?'

10:33.083 --> 10:35.917
Me and Billy dated. I knew him.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.792
It'd really help if you'd
tell us what you remember

10:37.875 --> 10:39.750
about that night, Tanya.

10:41.458 --> 10:44.458
We won the State Championship.

10:44.542 --> 10:46.083
Then there was a party.

10:47.458 --> 10:50.375
Go, Billy! Go, Billy! Go, Billy!

10:50.458 --> 10:53.709
Go, Billy!
Go, Billy! Go, Billy!

10:53.792 --> 10:55.458
Go, Billy!

10:58.291 --> 11:00.834
Philly Tech says he's their guy.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.583
But off the court,
this man is mine.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.917
(Billy)
'Where the hell's Herman?'

11:08.792 --> 11:10.834
Billy, what are you doin' here?

11:12.083 --> 11:14.125
Being friends.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.750
Isn't that what you said,
<i>friends?</i>

11:16.834 --> 11:18.709
Yo, don't be mad at her, man.

11:18.792 --> 11:21.417
Okay, I'll be mad at you.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.834
You take my girl,
I'm supposed to be cool with
it?

11:26.458 --> 11:27.500
Oh, man, you're drunk.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.208
Don't you walk away from me.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.000
Yo! Let him up,
let him up, let him up!

11:32.083 --> 11:34.542
Come on. Get off him.

11:34.625 --> 11:37.083
Get off him.

11:38.458 --> 11:39.792
You wanna talk, Billy?

11:42.583 --> 11:43.750
No.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.709
I'm on your home court here.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.083
I'll catch you later.

12:00.875 --> 12:04.667
How did Herman end up in
Players' Park that night?

12:04.750 --> 12:06.625
He'd go there to clear his head.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.417
What's Players' Park?

12:08.500 --> 12:11.542
It's across town.
It's where your dad died.

12:11.625 --> 12:12.959
(Freddie)
Back in Herman's day
that's where

12:13.041 --> 12:16.417
a player would go
to prove himself.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.208
We'll let you know,
what we find out, Tanya.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.875
(Lilly)
Billy Berkenpass?

12:32.959 --> 12:36.000
- Yes?
- Detectives Valens and Rush.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.417
Can we have a minute?

12:40.917 --> 12:43.166
Doing real good, Michael.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.291
Can we..

12:47.583 --> 12:50.041
'Should have known you
people would show up.'

12:50.125 --> 12:51.500
(Lilly)
'Why is that?'

12:51.583 --> 12:53.667
Everyone knows Ray Lester
got a death threat.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.208
I'm sure you think I made it.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.583
(Lilly)
'The call was made from
the City Center Rec.'

12:57.667 --> 12:59.667
Where you play ball every day.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.667
Guess someone's trying
to make me look bad.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.750
We got some prints
off of the phone.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.125
One of them
gonna be yours, Billy?

13:05.208 --> 13:07.583
I'll let you find
that out for
yourself.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.375
Let's talk about 1987,
when your teammate Herman died.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.667
Knew this was coming.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.792
Not long after Tanya
broke up with you for him.

13:15.875 --> 13:18.208
That pretty hard on you?

13:18.291 --> 13:20.875
Yeah. First heartbreak.

13:20.959 --> 13:22.709
What happened?

13:22.792 --> 13:23.959
Black girl, White guy.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.959
Then the world
wasn't rooting for us.

13:26.041 --> 13:29.834
Hey, sports question.
Think much of Ray's game?

13:29.917 --> 13:31.542
Papers say he's
the second coming of Herman.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.583
- What do you say?
- I've seen him a lot.

13:34.667 --> 13:37.041
He's as good as advertised.

13:37.125 --> 13:40.417
I didn't...call that kid.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.625
I didn't kill Herman.

13:41.709 --> 13:44.750
Right, home with your dad.

13:44.834 --> 13:49.208
So if it wasn't you,
Billy, who was it?

13:49.291 --> 13:52.041
Recruiting was outta
control over Herman.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.458
One coach handed
him a motel key.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.417
Said he had a super
model
waiting for him.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.834
Saying Herman
took that room key?

13:58.917 --> 14:00.333
Not that one.

14:00.417 --> 14:03.208
But I saw him take another key.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.250
I mean, who knows..

14:31.333 --> 14:34.083
...how many programs
Herman took gifts
from.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.625
But a player can only
make one school happy.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.625
Herman was about to piss off
a university, so they kill
him?

14:40.709 --> 14:42.250
Pretty far out theory, Billy.

14:42.333 --> 14:46.125
Maybe not a president, or a
dean, but you'd be surprised

14:46.208 --> 14:48.542
what the round ball
makes grown men do.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.542
Yeah, there was a car.
For a day.

14:54.625 --> 14:55.792
I got right in Herman's face

14:55.875 --> 14:57.750
told him the car goes back
where it came from.

14:57.834 --> 14:58.959
Which was where?

14:59.041 --> 15:00.792
Well, that I didn't
need to know.

15:00.875 --> 15:03.792
Bottom line, Herman was
on the bus the next day.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.667
Billy Berkenpass
thinks Herman received

15:05.750 --> 15:07.250
other under the table gifts.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.875
Billy Berkenpass has been
trying to muddy Herman's name

15:09.959 --> 15:12.417
since the day
I kicked him off the team.

15:13.375 --> 15:14.583
What happened there?

15:16.375 --> 15:19.000
I guess enough time has passed.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.208
I'll tell you.

15:21.291 --> 15:24.083
(Billy)
'That's right. I'm talking
about you and Big Ed Brown.'

15:24.166 --> 15:26.291
(Herman)
'You better watch
your mouth, man!'

15:26.375 --> 15:27.834
What the hell's the problem?

15:27.917 --> 15:28.959
Herman don't wanna win tonight.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.375
That's crap!

15:30.458 --> 15:32.834
'Cause his bookie
Big Ed Brown, he owns Herman!

15:32.917 --> 15:34.458
That's not true, coach. Come on.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.875
Then why'd he offer me 500 bucks
to join you in messing the game?

15:37.959 --> 15:39.667
- Don't you lie, Billy!
- It's the truth!

15:39.750 --> 15:41.667
He's on the take.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.834
You're gonna talk about Herman
like that, you're off this
team!

15:44.917 --> 15:47.166
- Coach!
- You're off this team!

15:56.500 --> 15:59.875
He'd say anything
to take down Herman.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.208
Attitude problem
three years running.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.834
Nothing to his allegations?

16:06.542 --> 16:07.917
Herman won the game for us.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.375
Shook four guys
and dunked on a seven-footer.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.750
End of story, okay?

16:13.834 --> 16:15.333
End of story.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.834
Oh! Boy, he missed a bunny.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.291
That's like three in a row.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.542
- '87 State Championship?
- Yeah.

16:26.625 --> 16:29.000
(Lilly)
'Herman's last night on
Earth.'

16:30.458 --> 16:32.125
He turned the ball over again.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.875
Okay, and now here's the end.

16:42.917 --> 16:46.959
Hey, freeze it, Scotty.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.834
Now, he had just won
the championship..

16:51.917 --> 16:55.417
...everyone else is going
wild
but look at Herman.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.667
(Nick)
'Nothing.'

16:56.750 --> 16:58.291
Maybe he agreed
to throw the game

16:58.375 --> 17:01.250
but in the end couldn't do it.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.250
That would explain
why he's not smiling.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.125
And maybe why he got killed.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.750
So, uh, was that the lady
who keeps calling you?

17:15.834 --> 17:17.417
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.875
- Sneak up on me.
- I'm not sneaking up on you.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.208
Yeah, like on
the street with Elisa.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.291
Look, don't shadow me, okay?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.917
Especially if you
see me with her.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.750
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.291
Guy's losing it?

17:36.959 --> 17:38.458
- Hey, boss.
- For you, Big Ed Brown.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.000
The guy Berkenpass said
approached him

17:40.083 --> 17:41.458
long-time bookie.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.625
Illegal lottery, bookmaking,
spanked with a bunch of

17:43.709 --> 17:45.000
probation, no jail time.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.667
Maybe Vice has got
somethin' on him.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.583
See if I can get a hammer
on him. Hey, where's Lil?

17:49.667 --> 17:51.291
Went to check with Ray to
see if he was approached

17:51.375 --> 17:53.083
about throwing
this Friday's game.

17:53.166 --> 17:54.208
Hmm.

17:54.291 --> 17:57.083
See if history's
repeating itself.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.125
Ray.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.125
Can I steal you for a minute?

18:11.583 --> 18:12.750
You catch that guy
who called me?

18:12.834 --> 18:14.542
Not yet.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.583
I got to ask you, Ray.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.750
Did anyone offer you
money
to fix the game this
Friday?

18:19.834 --> 18:21.000
No way.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.166
How about other games
during the season?

18:23.250 --> 18:26.125
College boosters
putting
pressure on you, or..

18:26.208 --> 18:27.709
Coach keeps all
the shady dudes away.

18:27.792 --> 18:31.583
Yeah, but coach can't be
everywhere at once, you know?

18:31.667 --> 18:32.792
Why you asking this stuff?

18:32.875 --> 18:34.417
Recruiting was
crazy for your
dad.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.667
People were trying to
get
to him in all sorts of
ways

18:36.750 --> 18:38.667
and I figure it's
like that for you
too.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.250
Yeah, it can be crazy.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.792
So maybe you're up against some
of the same things your dad was.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.667
Now you're saying my
dad made a shady deal?

18:45.750 --> 18:46.875
I'm not saying that.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.250
Or if he didn't make it
that got him killed?

18:48.333 --> 18:50.875
Ray, I don't know
what happened yet.

18:50.959 --> 18:52.834
But I wanna find out for you.

18:52.917 --> 18:55.667
I thought that Berkenpass dude
killed him.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.750
Right, he was
the primary
suspect.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.625
But maybe my dad got iced
over someone fixing a game

19:01.709 --> 19:05.000
or-or what school he was
gonna play for, over-over
ball?

19:05.083 --> 19:06.834
Try not to guess too much, Ray.

19:06.917 --> 19:11.083
Remember, we just need to
look
at all the possibilities.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.125
Never met no Billy Berkenpass.

19:16.208 --> 19:17.792
Well, he says he
met you, Big Ed.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.125
17 years back.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.583
- Nah.
- 'How about Herman Lester?'

19:26.083 --> 19:29.959
Hey, you like
fedora hats, Big Ed?

19:30.041 --> 19:32.750
- They look good on me.
- Great.

19:32.834 --> 19:35.709
You can wear one for your
mugshot like Al Capone.

19:35.792 --> 19:36.917
Capone?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.667
'You don't get chatty
real quick here'

19:38.750 --> 19:42.083
I get my pal at the IRS
comb over your income taxes

19:42.166 --> 19:44.041
blow your betting
operation open

19:44.125 --> 19:45.792
Big Ed's out of business.

19:47.959 --> 19:51.583
Maybe I do remember
young Herman.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.667
I was hopin'.

19:53.750 --> 19:56.417
But I was better
acquainted
with his Uncle Freddie.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.041
(male #4)
'Oh, man, hey'.

19:59.125 --> 20:03.208
Oh, Big Ed,
thank you for
coming.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.709
The only reason I'm here is
'cause you owe me five grand.

20:05.792 --> 20:06.917
Now, where is it?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.125
Oh, there's been
some
complications.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.208
Brother man,
that is the wrong answer.

20:11.291 --> 20:13.375
Yo, but, I got
the right
answer.

20:13.458 --> 20:14.834
But I need one more day.

20:14.917 --> 20:16.125
See, I got a plan.

20:16.208 --> 20:18.375
You know, it's foolproof too.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.834
Check it out.

20:19.917 --> 20:22.125
'Yeah, let it rain,
Herman, let it rain!'

20:22.208 --> 20:24.959
Yo, man, you best
pull out your
umbrella

20:25.041 --> 20:27.125
'cause you
getting soaked,
dog.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.875
Yeah. You gotta
give me one more day.

20:29.959 --> 20:31.166
See, Herman Lester's my nephew

20:31.250 --> 20:33.125
and the boy's got
a lot of love for
me

20:33.208 --> 20:34.875
so see with
tomorrow night's game

20:34.959 --> 20:37.125
I'm gonna get him to
do me a little favor.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.375
You telling me
you can get that boy

20:38.458 --> 20:40.667
to turn
the State Championship out?

20:40.750 --> 20:43.083
I can make it happen.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.542
Yo, Herman!

20:44.625 --> 20:46.208
'Who loves you, baby?'

20:46.291 --> 20:47.458
You do, Uncle Fred.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.000
'That's what I'm talking about.'

20:52.875 --> 20:55.500
Freddie had that kinda
influence over Herman?

20:55.583 --> 20:57.542
I wasn't sold.

20:57.625 --> 21:01.333
So I paid a visit
to the Berkenpass kid.

21:01.417 --> 21:02.375
How'd that go down?

21:02.458 --> 21:03.750
It didn't.

21:03.834 --> 21:06.750
And with no insurance,
I decided to sit that game
out.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.166
But the way Herman played

21:08.250 --> 21:10.750
it seemed like Freddie
did have him on a string.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.834
All I know is that
when it was over

21:12.917 --> 21:16.000
Freddie still owed me money.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.083
That must have had
him running scared.

21:18.166 --> 21:21.250
Sure.
But he slowed down.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.291
Maybe you've noticed..

21:23.375 --> 21:26.375
...Freddie don't
walk so good no more.

21:28.083 --> 21:29.000
You got something riding on

21:29.083 --> 21:30.125
this Friday's game, Freddie?

21:30.208 --> 21:31.291
What do you mean?

21:31.375 --> 21:32.333
Trying to keep Ray
outta playing

21:32.417 --> 21:33.875
so you could score some bets?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.875
Just like you tried to
score off his dad in '87.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.083
We know you asked Herman to

21:37.166 --> 21:38.667
throw the game
the night he died.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.625
Come on, now, if I did that,
why did they win, huh?

21:40.709 --> 21:42.417
Logic, Freddie.
Just 'cause they won

21:42.500 --> 21:45.041
don't mean you didn't ask him.

21:45.125 --> 21:47.125
I was in full
support
of Herman's
career.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.083
But you owed money
to Big Ed Brown.

21:49.166 --> 21:50.250
I paid Big Ed.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.959
Late, that's why you got
your knees broke.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.875
But first you tried' to fix
the Tech game to cash in on it

21:54.959 --> 21:57.083
'cause you didn't
want your knees broke.

21:57.166 --> 21:59.125
- Who does?
- Look, I talked to Big Ed.

21:59.208 --> 22:03.208
He told me. You promised
Herman would lose that
game.

22:03.291 --> 22:07.000
[scoffs]
Why didn't you just say
so at the top, huh?

22:08.041 --> 22:09.917
The truth, Freddie.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.333
It wasn't my proudest moment.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.750
Herman, this is a one-time,
and one-time only thing,
now.

22:20.834 --> 22:22.250
I can't believe
you're asking me this!

22:22.333 --> 22:25.041
You think I wanna be
asking?
I'm embarrassed, man.

22:25.125 --> 22:26.208
I can hardly
look you in the
eye.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.625
Can't you work it
out with Big Ed?

22:27.709 --> 22:30.000
This is working it
out,
don't you get that?

22:30.083 --> 22:33.542
Man, he's gonna hurt me.
For keeps, man, understand?

22:33.625 --> 22:36.083
Freddie, listen.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.291
You're gonna have
everything in this life,
man.

22:38.375 --> 22:41.000
The good Lord didn't give
me the talent he gave you.

22:41.083 --> 22:43.917
That's okay, I make do.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.667
But I'm asking you..

22:45.750 --> 22:47.417
...this once.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.375
Toss this dog a bone.

22:56.166 --> 22:59.375
No. I can't do it.

22:59.458 --> 23:02.083
I'm sorry, no.

23:02.166 --> 23:03.291
No.

23:06.709 --> 23:09.792
But when Herman played
so bad that night

23:09.875 --> 23:11.625
it looked he might come
through for you after all.

23:11.709 --> 23:14.458
Gave you hope during the whole
game right up to the buzzer.

23:14.542 --> 23:16.250
Oh, that must have
pissed you off.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.417
No, no, no!

23:17.500 --> 23:18.750
Ungrateful kid won't step up

23:18.834 --> 23:20.291
for the man who was
a father figure to him.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.291
'So maybe you're the one who'

23:21.375 --> 23:22.583
lowered the boom on Herman.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.333
That's an
outrage,
you saying that!

23:33.709 --> 23:34.834
What's wrong?

23:34.917 --> 23:36.458
Ray's missing.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.083
Could Ray have
skipped out on practice?

23:44.166 --> 23:46.125
No, no, no.

23:46.208 --> 23:49.500
Ray doesn't miss practice. He
comes early, leaves late
always.

23:49.583 --> 23:51.625
Maybe he just went
somewhere to clear his
head.

23:51.709 --> 23:52.875
(Tanya)
'You think Billy has him?'

23:52.959 --> 23:54.834
I'm gonna go see Billy
right now.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.208
Can I come?

23:57.750 --> 23:58.834
Yeah.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.583
Hey, Freddie?

24:04.667 --> 24:05.834
Stay close.

24:07.709 --> 24:09.959
Could the timing be worse?

24:10.041 --> 24:11.417
Did ray have somewhere
he had to be?

24:11.500 --> 24:14.417
Yeah. He had visits from
two big ten schools tonight.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.917
What's more
important here,
coach?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.125
I don't expect
you to understand.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.166
Blake.

24:19.250 --> 24:23.041
I understand
a 17-year-old's missing.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.333
That's important.

24:25.458 --> 24:26.875
Out on the street, boss.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.709
This is craziness.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.875
My baby's all over the place
and I can't find him.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.000
'He can't be far.'

24:46.083 --> 24:48.583
I can't lose him too.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.291
Look.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.500
Where is he? Where's my baby?

24:52.583 --> 24:53.709
- Tanya, what are--
- What did you do with him?

24:53.792 --> 24:54.959
I don't know what you mean.

24:55.041 --> 24:56.542
Ray's been
missing
all afternoon.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.333
- They say you watch him!
- Tanya, that ain't gonna
help.

24:58.417 --> 24:59.875
T, I wouldn't hurt your kid.

24:59.959 --> 25:02.208
- How about her kid's father?
- I believed you, Billy.

25:02.291 --> 25:05.166
I was the one person who
didn't think you killed
Herman.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.250
So keep believing.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.625
I wouldn't do
anything to hurt
you.

25:13.417 --> 25:15.375
Not then..

25:15.458 --> 25:18.250
...not now.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.291
How did you find this place?

25:31.291 --> 25:32.792
Asked some old timers.

25:34.875 --> 25:37.291
I've put up
about
100 jumpers.

25:37.375 --> 25:39.333
But didn't know
where
the right spot was.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.125
What spot?

25:45.166 --> 25:46.250
Where he died.

25:49.375 --> 25:50.959
Do you know?

25:54.250 --> 25:56.792
The write-up said
on that free throw line.

26:11.208 --> 26:12.875
For Herman Lester.

26:19.417 --> 26:20.792
You make it look easy.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.083
I'm glad you're doing
this,
finding out about my
dad.

26:29.166 --> 26:31.792
- Yeah?
- 'Cause I never could.

26:31.875 --> 26:35.792
Asking her anything about
him brings her to her knees.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.500
Your mom.

26:37.583 --> 26:40.125
'I never knew him.'

26:40.208 --> 26:41.875
But that don't mean
I don't wanna hear about him

26:41.959 --> 26:44.166
or find out how
come he got killed.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.041
You're gonna play tomorrow?

26:54.083 --> 26:56.917
Starting to think that
call I got was no joke.

26:58.208 --> 27:01.709
No one will blame you
if you sit the game out.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.709
Coach will.

27:03.792 --> 27:05.083
'Course, playing's
the last thing

27:05.166 --> 27:07.709
Freddie wants me to do.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.166
What's in it for him?

27:11.083 --> 27:13.542
Freddie got me connected
with all the shoe companies.

27:13.625 --> 27:16.250
I go league, he
gets
taken care of.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.417
Hmm.

27:18.625 --> 27:21.542
And you think you owe Freddie.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.041
I owe coach too.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.000
- What does he want you to do?
- College.

27:27.083 --> 27:29.375
See, there's two or
three
schools that want me.

27:29.458 --> 27:31.458
And I thought every
school wanted you.

27:31.542 --> 27:34.875
Yeah, but there's two or
three
that want both me and
coach.

27:34.959 --> 27:37.542
See, so if I sign
that letter of
intent

27:37.625 --> 27:40.917
coach comes along,
part of a package
deal.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.291
Hmm.

27:44.166 --> 27:46.709
Turns out if Ray decides
to go to a certain college

27:46.792 --> 27:48.333
Coach Lein benefits big.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.083
So is coach aiming
to take the same ride

27:50.166 --> 27:51.625
on Herman's back 17 years ago?

27:51.709 --> 27:53.250
And how badly did he want it?

27:53.333 --> 27:56.417
Maybe the gambling angle
isn't the answer.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.375
Did Herman ever say where
he was going to school?

27:58.458 --> 28:00.458
No one knew.
There was a new rumor every day.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.417
Kansas, Iowa, Duke.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.000
She'd probably know.

28:15.875 --> 28:16.959
Sorry, boss.

28:18.542 --> 28:21.250
Don't let this change
the investigation.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.959
- Thank you for finding him.
- Sure.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.959
Tanya, had Herman made
a decision about where

28:32.041 --> 28:33.083
he was going to college?

28:33.166 --> 28:34.291
Temple.

28:34.375 --> 28:37.000
'He was gonna announce
it the next day.'

28:37.083 --> 28:38.917
The Owls head coach
is John Chaney.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.291
He's always run a clean program.

28:40.375 --> 28:41.792
He does not do favors.

28:41.875 --> 28:45.208
So maybe coach wanted
Herman to go somewhere else.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.792
Where they did do favors.

28:48.667 --> 28:51.083
Coach wanted him
down in Florida.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.166
(Lien)
'Temple's not the place.'

28:57.250 --> 28:59.041
(Herman)
'I've already made
up my mind, coach.'

28:59.125 --> 29:00.875
(Lien)
'You'll end up at the wrong
program you get lost'

29:00.959 --> 29:03.333
'in the shuffle, doesn't
matter
how talented you are.'

29:03.417 --> 29:05.291
'Down in Florida,
I can look out for you.'

29:05.375 --> 29:06.625
I've got responsibilities here.

29:06.709 --> 29:09.166
- What do you mean?
- Tanya's pregnant.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.917
Okay, so-so Tanya comes too.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.625
- No, it's no good.
- What?

29:15.709 --> 29:17.583
- No!
- Dammit, Herman.

29:17.667 --> 29:19.667
We need to stay together.

29:19.750 --> 29:23.333
This is my shot too. Haven't I
always been there for you?

29:33.250 --> 29:35.000
So coach finds out
things aren't going

29:35.083 --> 29:37.000
the way he wants them to.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.333
Six hours before Herman dies.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.500
John.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.166
You saved the day finding Ray.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.959
Hmm. Talk to her.

29:51.041 --> 29:53.792
You get those college
meetings rescheduled, coach?

29:55.750 --> 29:59.792
It's plan B...if Ray
doesn't play tonight.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.667
- But I know he will.
- Huh.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.709
You're counting on it,
aren't you?

30:04.500 --> 30:07.125
Whatever you say, missy.

30:07.208 --> 30:10.041
I think this room's got
the wrong population, boss.

30:14.208 --> 30:16.709
Lots of opinions from that one.

30:19.291 --> 30:23.083
Blake, the last 24 hours
we've been looking at you

30:23.166 --> 30:24.875
for Herman's murder.

30:24.959 --> 30:26.750
You kiddin' me?

30:28.458 --> 30:30.959
When Herman broke the news
that he was going to Temple

30:31.041 --> 30:34.375
I know you had
a lot on the line.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.417
He was hurting your future.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.709
John, we're friends!

30:38.792 --> 30:41.458
We're gonna hear you out
one way or another,
Blake.

30:41.542 --> 30:43.875
It's better if you
and I do it here and
now.

30:46.542 --> 30:50.041
Now, I know
you got a deep
drive.

30:51.834 --> 30:54.291
All of us got one somewhere..

30:54.375 --> 30:57.083
...and it will either make
you
a winner or take you down.

30:59.375 --> 31:01.500
I need you to make
a gut check here,
pal.

31:07.834 --> 31:09.083
Me and Herman..

31:11.792 --> 31:13.500
...we had a moment of truth.

31:20.208 --> 31:21.875
You been in here the whole time?

31:21.959 --> 31:23.041
Yeah.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.500
Trying to wait me out
like I'd just go home?

31:27.875 --> 31:29.792
Don't you walk away from me.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.959
Hey!

31:32.041 --> 31:33.250
Coach!

31:33.333 --> 31:35.041
You think you can just go

31:35.125 --> 31:37.125
after all I've done for you?

31:46.208 --> 31:48.625
You won us
a State Championship
tonight

31:50.166 --> 31:51.959
and I'm standing
here
crying the blues.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.375
That's pretty piss-poor.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.792
Good luck at Temple, son.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.875
I never saw Herman again.

32:28.834 --> 32:30.250
Okay. Thanks.

32:31.792 --> 32:34.500
Prints from the City Center
Rec
payphone came in.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.083
Guess who we got a match on?

32:36.166 --> 32:38.125
Berkenpass?

32:38.208 --> 32:39.542
His father.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.500
What's the big deal?

32:46.583 --> 32:47.792
So I made a call.

32:50.792 --> 32:52.166
Get off my property.

32:52.250 --> 32:53.542
Not just a call.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.208
A terrorist threat.

32:55.291 --> 32:56.542
- Come on.
- No jokes.

32:56.625 --> 32:59.083
If I were you,
I'd put that wood
down.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.917
Why use the phone at the rec?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.959
You and your son
dream that up together?

33:08.041 --> 33:09.333
My son didn't know I was there.

33:09.417 --> 33:10.709
Noontime he was in the gym.

33:10.792 --> 33:13.709
You telling me,
you two didn't cross paths?

33:13.792 --> 33:14.917
Well, we never do.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.250
We got no relationship.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.000
Why is that?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.583
Billy wasn't athletic.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.583
He had no foot speed
to talk about.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.250
So we made him a shooter.

33:27.333 --> 33:29.083
Developed the purest stroke
you'd ever wanna see.

33:29.166 --> 33:30.375
It didn't happen overnight

33:30.458 --> 33:31.834
I'd feed him and
feed him and feed him

33:31.917 --> 33:33.542
and there wasn't a night
that we left that gym

33:33.625 --> 33:35.750
without him hitting 15 in a row.

33:35.834 --> 33:39.250
What's that have to do with
you not having a relationship?

33:39.333 --> 33:41.834
[scoffs]
He quit on me.

33:43.959 --> 33:45.917
What, you don't
tell
me what happened?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.417
You just let me
show up at the game?

33:48.500 --> 33:50.834
I was embarrassed.

33:50.917 --> 33:53.792
Son, if you would've told me,
I would've helped.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.250
But now it doesn't matter
if it's not true

33:55.333 --> 33:57.000
because the word's out,
you're a bad seed!

33:57.083 --> 33:59.667
I'm sorry.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.125
Up, up, up. Chin up.

34:02.208 --> 34:07.250
Listen, we may not get more
than a junior college offer..

34:07.333 --> 34:09.208
...but two years,
we're right back on track.

34:09.291 --> 34:12.625
Dad, it's over! I'm done.

34:14.834 --> 34:16.834
Don't let this
break your spirit.

34:16.917 --> 34:20.500
I'm not, dad. I don't
care about being on
track!

34:22.250 --> 34:25.291
I just want
playing
ball to be fun
again.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.625
Fun?

34:27.709 --> 34:30.125
Billy, you go home..

34:30.208 --> 34:33.000
...and you get your suitcase..

34:33.083 --> 34:34.709
...and when
you're done having fun

34:34.792 --> 34:37.709
and you come back
and you see me!

34:48.041 --> 34:50.166
Billy never plays
organized ball again.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.208
You draw a line
through his name?

34:53.750 --> 34:56.000
We do what we do.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.208
Now and then I'll go back
and watch him shoot at the
rec.

34:58.291 --> 35:00.125
Those are old wounds.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.709
So why all of a sudden
make this call to Ray?

35:02.792 --> 35:04.625
I was leaving the rec that day

35:04.709 --> 35:06.542
seeing Ray Lester's face
splattered all over

35:06.625 --> 35:08.333
like these people are
the first family of
basketball

35:08.417 --> 35:12.166
or something, that nonsense
had to stop once and for all.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.458
We got to arrest you
for making that
threat.

35:14.542 --> 35:17.000
- Hey, for crying out loud.
- Come on.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.750
You gotta come with us.

35:22.667 --> 35:25.208
Prints were in the system 'cause
of a bar brawl three years back.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.458
I talked to the guy
that got beat down by him.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.709
Said it all started 'cause
the barflies were talking

35:29.792 --> 35:32.041
about the late great
Herman Lester.

35:32.125 --> 35:34.125
14 years later and
he's
still smarting over
that?

35:34.208 --> 35:37.083
This guy's got deep feelings
about his son not playing
ball.

35:37.166 --> 35:38.542
Disowned him over it.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.291
Maybe killed over it.

35:40.375 --> 35:43.417
Problem is, the Berkenpass
alibi goes both ways.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.542
Covers Billy but
also covers the dad.

35:45.625 --> 35:47.875
Ah, senior won't give it up.

35:47.959 --> 35:49.375
So work on junior.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.208
(Lilly)
We just need some
last questions answered

35:53.291 --> 35:54.709
then we'll leave you alone.

35:54.792 --> 35:58.000
- We got a new suspect,
Billy.
- Good for you.

35:58.083 --> 35:59.709
Need the straight
story on your alibi.

35:59.792 --> 36:00.959
Straight story?

36:01.041 --> 36:03.333
You were in your car,
shooting hoops?

36:03.417 --> 36:05.750
Doesn't matter, we just got
to hear where you really were.

36:07.792 --> 36:10.000
Watching TV with my dad.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.166
Maybe we gotta
level with Billy.

36:16.166 --> 36:17.792
He's gonna find out anyway.

36:19.583 --> 36:21.834
Pops put the death
threat on Ray.

36:23.291 --> 36:24.583
My dad?

36:24.667 --> 36:26.250
You surprised?

36:26.333 --> 36:27.959
'Cause you look surprised.

36:28.041 --> 36:32.083
But the funny thing is,
you look it and you don't.

36:32.166 --> 36:35.917
My guess is, you never knew
your dad killed Herman either.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.500
But right now in this moment..

36:40.750 --> 36:42.583
...you do.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.875
'Cause you and dad never
watched TV that night.

36:44.959 --> 36:47.583
Can I just go now?

36:49.959 --> 36:51.834
Sure. We'll walk you out.

36:56.166 --> 36:58.041
Ray's just taking care
of some paperwork.

37:00.709 --> 37:02.000
Hey, you want to
meet him, Billy?

37:02.083 --> 37:03.792
(Billy)
'No, thanks.'

37:03.875 --> 37:05.083
Yeah, we keep arguing over

37:05.166 --> 37:06.500
whether he looks
like his pops or not.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.458
He does. A little.

37:09.542 --> 37:11.291
Yeah, but the difference is

37:11.375 --> 37:13.625
Ray's walking away
from the game.

37:13.709 --> 37:14.875
W-walking away?

37:14.959 --> 37:16.583
Ray's mixed up about
how his dad died.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.000
Figures Herman
made a wrong decision

37:18.083 --> 37:20.458
and maybe
that's what killed him.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.959
Why does he think that?

37:22.041 --> 37:23.792
He didn't know anything
about his dad.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.625
(Scotty)
'Looks like another Lester
won't reach his potential.'

37:30.375 --> 37:32.750
Maybe I-I will say hi to him.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.709
Sure.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.250
Hey, kid.

38:03.333 --> 38:05.000
I wanna tell you
something about him.

38:07.542 --> 38:09.000
And that night.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.375
I wasn't at home with my dad.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.834
I-I was with Herman.

38:22.792 --> 38:24.208
Gotta hand it to you.

38:24.291 --> 38:26.166
Only Herman Lester
can play ball that bad

38:26.250 --> 38:29.166
and still get carried
off the court like a king.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.834
Final score's all that counts.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.208
Keep telling yourself that.

38:32.291 --> 38:33.709
You think I tried to
throw the game
tonight?

38:33.792 --> 38:35.792
- Yeah, I do.
- You're wrong.

38:35.875 --> 38:38.667
Then why did you
play like a buster?

38:42.083 --> 38:44.709
You..

38:44.792 --> 38:46.709
What?

38:46.792 --> 38:50.709
[sighs]
Everybody thinks
I'm this one-man show.

38:50.792 --> 38:53.750
But it's you that
gets
me the ball in the
paint.

38:53.834 --> 38:56.875
When I'm double-teamed,
you always hit the J.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.750
[sighs]
But you weren't there
tonight.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.458
Billy..

39:04.542 --> 39:06.959
...we haven't been friends.

39:07.041 --> 39:08.959
But we've been a team, right?

39:17.959 --> 39:20.250
Your dad was stand-up.

39:20.333 --> 39:22.709
There was all this
junk around us

39:22.792 --> 39:25.709
everyone were trying
to make us enemies.

39:25.792 --> 39:29.750
But he-he just
followed his
instincts.

39:29.834 --> 39:31.834
And they were good.

39:35.166 --> 39:37.125
The man was good.

40:01.375 --> 40:03.625
We talked to your boy
Billy, Mr. Berkenpass.

40:03.709 --> 40:05.667
He burned your alibi.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.417
Why would he do that?

40:08.500 --> 40:11.583
'Cause he didn't
kill Herman Lester.

40:11.667 --> 40:12.917
You did.

40:15.208 --> 40:16.291
Billy said that?

40:19.542 --> 40:22.041
Want us to bring him in here?

40:24.667 --> 40:25.750
No.

40:30.917 --> 40:34.041
It was always awkward
for Billy and me.

40:36.291 --> 40:39.333
Basketball was the way
that I could be his dad, see?

40:41.208 --> 40:42.875
That was our whole relationship.

40:44.583 --> 40:47.959
[sobbing]
That night when I told
Billy to pack his bags, I..

40:50.917 --> 40:52.667
I wanted to take it back.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.125
Why didn't you?

40:55.208 --> 40:57.333
I followed after him.

40:57.417 --> 40:59.166
Wound up at Players' Park.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.166
And I watched Herman and Billy..

41:05.959 --> 41:07.667
I watched them shaking hands.

41:12.458 --> 41:14.583
That wasn't a good thing?

41:14.667 --> 41:16.709
That was him giving up.

41:20.125 --> 41:23.792
I knew that he wasn't
gonna play again.

41:23.875 --> 41:27.291
That was the end of one
thing that we had in common.

41:56.750 --> 41:59.041
Uh, hey, Mr. B.

41:59.125 --> 42:01.834
If you're looking for
Billy,
you just missed him.

42:01.917 --> 42:03.000
Yeah.

42:04.041 --> 42:06.250
Think he said
he was headed home.

42:06.333 --> 42:08.625
Then I guess I'll
see him there
then.

42:10.125 --> 42:13.875
Are you okay, sir?
You, uh, look a little off.

42:17.166 --> 42:18.959
Good game tonight.

44:03.792 --> 44:06.041
(male announcer)
'And finally..'

44:06.125 --> 44:08.500
'Six-one and a senior..'

44:08.583 --> 44:12.500
'Ray "The Second Coming"
Lester!'
