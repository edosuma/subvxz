01:06.766 --> 01:08.333
Want to play again?

01:10.336 --> 01:13.072
Give you a chance
to get those cigarettes back.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.313
I'm scared, man.

01:21.315 --> 01:24.183
Don't got too many friends
on the outside.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.517
Not anymore.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.422
Just keep your eye
on the end game.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.125
Everything will fall
into place.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.628
I'm going to miss you,
chess man.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.367
Listen to me, Eugene.

01:44.237 --> 01:48.207
Every day you out there,
you out there for me

01:48.209 --> 01:50.776
and every other brother in here

01:50.778 --> 01:52.511
who's never going
to be out there again.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.389
I made this for you.

02:08.261 --> 02:09.561
Take care of the king.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.532
Everything else follows.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.243
You good?
Yeah.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.758
Jamal, I appreciate
you for this, my brother.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.362
Hey, man,
I... I owe you one.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.898
Well, since your memory
serves you so well,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.000
think you can help me
find some work?

03:56.302 --> 03:57.236
Honest work?

03:59.739 --> 04:01.373
Yeah.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.507
I think I can do something.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.262
There's the
halfway house, my brother.

04:23.264 --> 04:23.962
Pull over there.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.116
Hey, you need a car?

04:44.118 --> 04:45.550
Actually,
I'm friends with Jamal.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.918
I'm here about a job.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.721
Right. Right. Yeah.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.790
Well, we got some spots
in the night shift.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.759
What kind of late
hours you keep?

04:53.761 --> 04:56.289
I keep whatever hours
you need me to keep.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.797
That's a good answer.
That's a good answer.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.100
All right, fill that out.
Great.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.669
When could you start?

05:03.671 --> 05:06.138
Whenever is clever.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.407
A lot of guys who come in
here looking for work,

05:08.409 --> 05:10.475
head cases.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.810
Ex-cons at best.

05:17.150 --> 05:17.883
When did you get out?

06:21.881 --> 06:22.914
Sorry.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.391
Hello, Eugene.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.326
Trini?

06:34.328 --> 06:34.693
Is that you, baby?

06:38.097 --> 06:40.932
My goodness, Trini.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.901
Y-You want your usual,
extra chocolate?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.537
No, I can't.
I have class.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.572
What are you studying?

06:47.574 --> 06:48.407
Pre-law.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.811
My daughter's
going to be a lawyer.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.783
Listen, Trini, I know
it's been a long time, but...

06:57.785 --> 07:00.819
I'm-I'm sorry,
I just...

07:00.821 --> 07:03.121
I don't have time
for this right now.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.457
But I wanted to come
tell you in person.

07:07.126 --> 07:07.993
Marco's locked up.

07:11.998 --> 07:15.100
He's been in juvenile detention
for almost a year now.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.837
Selling drugs.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.242
I really have to go now.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.844
Wait, wait, Trini, please.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.513
I really have to go, Eugene.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.114
I'm sorry.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.550
Take care.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.874
Some things change...

07:55.876 --> 07:58.844
other things
stay the same damn way.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.147
I'll be damned.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.124
What's up, buddy?
Been too long, man.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.593
Yes, sir.
I'm out.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.229
You got a place to stay?

08:17.231 --> 08:18.029
Halfway house.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.436
I can hook you up with a car.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.638
Remember Andre?
Dre?

08:26.640 --> 08:29.241
He's got a Crown Vic just sitting there.
Word?

08:29.243 --> 08:30.442
Beat up.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.443
On its last legs.

08:32.446 --> 08:36.147
So, no brother really wants
to take that off his hands.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.250
Watch this.
I can grab it for you.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.328
It'll do you some good.
I appreciate it.

08:40.355 --> 08:40.885
Yes, sir.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.889
Thank you, my brother.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.157
What I really need
is a job, though.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.759
Money is just...

08:47.761 --> 08:50.061
cash is tight, man.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.464
Seems like nobody wants
to hire an ex-con.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.832
Parole board didn't set you up?

08:53.834 --> 08:56.801
There's a waiting list.

08:56.803 --> 09:00.005
Maybe a couple
of weeks at least.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.210
Look, man, I do maintenance
over at the Maud Alton school.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.512
I can try and put a good word in for you.
Is that right?

09:07.514 --> 09:09.915
Yeah.
It's not so bad if you don't mind

09:09.917 --> 09:12.317
hanging around the kids all day.
Psh.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.319
I hung around a lot worse.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.057
Can't make any promises now.
Hey, you know me.

09:17.083 --> 09:17.989
It's all good.

09:17.991 --> 09:18.790
Okay.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.027
What about Perry?

09:22.029 --> 09:24.129
He still hang around?
Oh, yeah.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.291
After you went in, he
became the man around here.

09:26.317 --> 09:26.831
Word?

09:26.833 --> 09:30.468
Yeah, he's got his hands
in some of everything, man.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.736
Good for him.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.673
What?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.107
I'm glad you came home, Eugene.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.210
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

10:12.211 --> 10:15.246
Ma'am, I'm going
to cut to the chase.

10:15.248 --> 10:19.250
I'm a real hard worker. I'm disciplined.
Keep to myself.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.287
Well, I, I haven't even given you
a job description yet.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.590
Well, whatever it is,
I'll get it done.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.993
You know, we've been losing
our funding left and right.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.762
So, the pay
wouldn't be very good.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.964
I understand.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.167
How long have you known Billy?

10:36.169 --> 10:37.802
Since I was 14.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.305
Well, he speaks highly of you.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.143
Like I said,
the-the pay won't be good

10:45.145 --> 10:49.147
and the kids, well,
they are a handful.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.783
Well, I'm real good
with children.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.918
I got two beautiful
kids of my own.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.688
I know how to handle
them pretty good.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.658
Well, when would you
be able to start?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.792
Yesterday.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.240
Well, well, well.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.176
My brother, my brother.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.177
Perry.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.579
Look at you.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.114
Look at you.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.352
Just living the good life.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.354
Hey.

11:32.992 --> 11:35.226
So, you're out now.
I'm out.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.562
Look, I just wanted
to say, okay...

11:37.564 --> 11:41.232
Perry, let's let the past
stay in the past, all right?

11:41.234 --> 11:44.836
You're not even going to give me a
chance to say what I was going to say?

11:44.838 --> 11:49.407
If you need anything,
anything, okay?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.176
A job,

11:51.178 --> 11:53.111
a lady,

11:53.113 --> 11:56.948
I want you to give me a call,
all right?

11:56.950 --> 11:59.584
The way I'm living now,

11:59.586 --> 12:04.756
what I got now,

12:04.758 --> 12:05.490
I owe you that.

12:07.259 --> 12:11.863
Here's my number.
Don't be afraid to use it.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.834
Hey, boys, you're looking
at a living legend.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.502
One of the last true soldiers.

12:18.804 --> 12:21.039
I used to run behind him.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.942
They don't get it.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.044
They ain't like us, Gene.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.779
They don't appreciate.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.916
Hey, I want you to call me,

12:31.918 --> 12:33.017
all right?

12:34.854 --> 12:35.420
Let's go.

13:10.689 --> 13:11.923
What's going on here?

13:19.265 --> 13:21.332
What is this?

13:21.334 --> 13:24.502
Why you looking at me?
Why are you even in detention, Cliff?

13:24.504 --> 13:27.138
Why do you even bother showing
up here if you don't give a damn

13:27.140 --> 13:29.774
about anything, least of all,
your future at Maud Alton?

13:29.776 --> 13:32.010
You're tripping, Ms. Gadbaw.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.978
Why do you think
I'm up in here, huh?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.413
These my best customers.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.819
I want you both
in Princi...

13:43.789 --> 13:44.956
Shh.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.498
Whoops.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.701
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:59.038 --> 14:01.339
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

14:06.378 --> 14:08.913
Hey, did I tell you
I saw Katrina?

14:08.915 --> 14:10.515
My baby's going to be a lawyer.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.250
Oh, yeah?
Trini?

14:12.252 --> 14:13.351
Yes, sir.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.986
Man.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.621
She was always bright, that one.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.956
Got that right.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.425
How about Marco?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.540
<i>Excuse me.</i>

14:39.846 --> 14:42.380
Now, what exactly
happened in here?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.183
What are you talking
about, Ms. King?

14:45.185 --> 14:48.286
I mean, where did Ms. Gadbaw go?

14:48.288 --> 14:51.389
She won't be here
for the rest of the day.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.893
Does that mean we get to be out
for the rest of the day, too?

14:54.895 --> 14:57.395
No, that doesn't, T.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.164
Now I'm going to find
a replacement monitor.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.834
Each of you
will act responsibly

15:02.836 --> 15:04.802
while I do so.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.004
Is that clear?

15:16.415 --> 15:19.450
Ms. King.
Have a good day, now.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.424
Everything all right?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.893
No, actually.

15:28.895 --> 15:33.231
Ms. Gadbaw,
the detention monitor...

15:33.233 --> 15:35.733
Mr. Brown, would you mind
doing me a quick favor?

15:35.735 --> 15:37.068
It'll only take a minute.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.973
<i>Now, if there are</i>
<i>any problems in here,</i>

15:41.975 --> 15:46.344
Mr. Brown will report
them directly to me.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.378
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

15:50.349 --> 15:52.483
Thank you so much.
I'll be back with a monitor soon.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.218
It's fine.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.003
Hey, y'all supposed
to be out of your seats?

16:12.005 --> 16:15.373
Hey, man, we just getting up so you can
clean the gum off the bottom of our chairs.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.614
I got to go to the bathroom.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.883
Not until Ms. King gets back.
She'll be back in a minute.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.385
Come on. Please?

16:31.690 --> 16:32.724
What's your name, son?

16:32.726 --> 16:33.891
I'm Percy Hall.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.160
Yo, sit down, Peanut.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.528
Peanut?

16:37.530 --> 16:38.696
Is that what they call you?

16:40.466 --> 16:43.201
What you want, girl?
What you want?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.603
Hey, all right.
That's enough, now.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.571
Come on, y'all.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.905
Have a seat.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.273
Sit down.

16:51.844 --> 16:56.147
You let me go to the bathroom, I
can make them sit and stay down.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.149
No deal.
Man.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.918
Hey, I'm not going to tell
y'all again, sit down.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.054
Yo, relax, man.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.523
Man, we ain't got to listen to no janitor.
You ain't no teacher.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.527
Have a seat, son, right now.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.962
Or what?

17:10.964 --> 17:12.296
You some kind of tough guy?

17:12.298 --> 17:13.798
You want to find out?

17:16.001 --> 17:17.167
Huh?

17:29.481 --> 17:31.049
<i>What is he doing?</i>

17:34.753 --> 17:35.553
Sit down.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.198
What you nodding
your head for, Peanut?

17:59.578 --> 18:00.845
All right.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.293
Trini.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.895
How do you know where I live?
I looked you up.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.392
Just because I went to jail
don't mean I can't read.

18:20.418 --> 18:21.899
"Doesn't" mean you can't read.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.701
Hey, Trini, Trini.

18:23.703 --> 18:24.869
It's "Katrina."

18:24.871 --> 18:25.837
Sorry.

18:25.839 --> 18:26.637
Katrina.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.275
I got a job at your old school.

18:34.913 --> 18:38.916
I know I made mistakes
in the past, a lot of mistakes.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.652
I'm just trying to make
things right, that's all.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.988
I'm just trying to make things
right with you, Katrina.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.389
You're my girl.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.528
Trini.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.132
You're my gir...

18:54.134 --> 18:55.266
Trini.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.538
I just want to make
things right for us.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.170
Ms. King.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.472
Mr. Brown.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.507
Thanks again for the other day.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.976
I was...
I was really impressed.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.778
You're welcome.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.814
Well, I'm off to a meeting.
Keep up the good work.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.150
Oh...

19:46.152 --> 19:49.654
about the other day.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.957
When is Ms. Gadbaw
coming back?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.959
She's not.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.828
Oh, well, what are you going
to do about detention?

20:12.578 --> 20:15.012
What you doing in these parts?

20:15.014 --> 20:17.448
I missed my bus, was late.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.383
I don't plan on
making it a habit.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.852
Maybe you should.

20:21.854 --> 20:22.653
I'm here.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.923
Name's Michelle, right?

20:25.925 --> 20:26.757
I'm T.

20:28.093 --> 20:29.527
I know who you are.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.735
All right, let's go.
Everybody have a seat.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.803
Aw.

20:40.105 --> 20:41.572
Look who it is.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.407
You here to clean
the blackboards?

20:45.677 --> 20:48.346
For those of you who don't remember
me, my name is Eugene Brown.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.881
Does that mean
we can call you "Genie?"

20:50.883 --> 20:53.150
That'd be the last thing
you ever call me.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.452
<i>Ooh.</i>

20:54.454 --> 20:55.786
What's that?

20:55.788 --> 20:57.688
This here is a chess board.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.991
Anybody know how to play chess?

21:01.628 --> 21:03.194
Hey, yo.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.996
You think you're
pretty smart, huh?

21:04.998 --> 21:06.998
Why don't you come up here
and play me a game, then.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.467
You're corny, man.
I ain't playing no games with you.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.801
What's your name, son?

21:10.803 --> 21:13.337
Clifton.
And I ain't your son.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.905
Fair enough, Clifton.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.108
Big bad Clifton.

21:17.110 --> 21:22.179
Well, okay, if you ain't got
the guts to play me, Clifton,

21:22.181 --> 21:24.048
does anybody else?
Anyone?

21:24.050 --> 21:25.149
Yo.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.284
I'll play this.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.754
You like cards?

21:29.756 --> 21:30.855
Fine.

21:30.857 --> 21:31.589
We'll play cards.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.299
Here's the deal.
If you win...

21:41.301 --> 21:45.169
the whole class gets to do whatever
they want for the rest of detention.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.103
What?

21:48.908 --> 21:52.476
But if I win, you learn a new game.
You hustling me?

21:52.478 --> 21:53.661
Hustle? You're the one that

21:53.687 --> 21:55.546
wanted to play cards, homie.
You right.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.381
Go ahead and play
this clown, Peanut.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.749
You'll never get beat.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.556
You know the game...

22:05.558 --> 22:07.925
find the red ace?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.660
Huh?

22:09.662 --> 22:12.997
My name is Peter Paul.
I come from Montreal.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.965
Came to play 'em all.

22:14.967 --> 22:19.637
I've broken hipsters and
slicksters, elbows, and a-holes.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.405
Your name is Peter what?

22:21.407 --> 22:23.174
Go ahead and pick
the one you like.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.742
Nah-ah-ah.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.144
Bet you're dead, Jack.
Man, I see it.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.612
I see it.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.047
Don't you worry
about me seeing it.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.188
See, here's
what happened to you.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.657
You thought you knew the
truth, but it wasn't there.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.692
And it never will be until
you learn where to look.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.160
He's messing with you, Peanut.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.762
Man, I can catch it.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.430
I-I-I was just
screwing around, man.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.565
Let me get one more shot.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.900
One more shot?
Yeah.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.071
My name is Peter Paul.
I come from Montreal.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.773
I came to play 'em all.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.344
Ah-ah-ah.

23:00.346 --> 23:01.946
Make sure you see it.

23:14.893 --> 23:19.597
This is a king.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.799
This is your life.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.935
One mistake and it
can be taken away.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.171
Wha.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.989
Look, man.

23:44.991 --> 23:48.292
Yo, this is going
to be the meeting spot.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.760
All you got to do
is go in there,

23:49.762 --> 23:50.961
grab the stuff, and be out.

23:53.498 --> 23:54.565
You get the money yet?

23:57.602 --> 24:00.638
No, man, I ain't seen
my uncle in two weeks.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.474
What the hell we going to do, Cliff?
I don't...

24:03.476 --> 24:05.576
Look, man, if I can't
get the money...

24:07.712 --> 24:09.814
Forget it, man.
We're just going to lift it.

24:13.485 --> 24:14.985
My cousin gave it to me.

24:19.258 --> 24:20.591
That's fly, right?

24:22.060 --> 24:24.462
You know I don't
roll like that, Cliff.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.596
Well, how do you roll?

24:27.232 --> 24:30.167
You don't see what a good
opportunity this is?

24:30.169 --> 24:31.902
Huh?

24:31.904 --> 24:33.871
You ain't got no job,
you ain't got no money,

24:33.873 --> 24:36.106
you ain't got no opportunity,
your mom's half gone...

24:36.108 --> 24:40.344
Shut up about my mom, man.
Yo, that's the truth, T, and you know it.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.112
Look, man, we pull this job off

24:42.114 --> 24:44.882
and we ain't got to worry
about nothing no more.

24:46.184 --> 24:47.651
Nothing.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.992
Now, you think about that.

24:58.563 --> 25:02.066
Now, everyone on the board is here
for one reason and one reason only.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.400
To protect the king.

25:03.402 --> 25:04.568
That is right.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.303
To protect the king.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.973
Now, he is old and has
survived many battles.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.975
So he can only move
one spot at a time.

25:10.977 --> 25:15.446
So, who's got his back
if he can only move one spot?

25:15.448 --> 25:17.448
The queen.

25:17.450 --> 25:20.818
Now, she is smarter, faster,
and stronger than her king.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.525
The knight is the horse.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.794
Now, he can move two spots forward
and one spot to the side.

25:32.764 --> 25:36.534
The trusty bishop
is his diagonal attack.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.969
The rook, he patrols
the entire board.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.971
He can move as many
spaces as he wants,

25:40.973 --> 25:43.774
as long as it's in the same
direction he was moving.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.445
Oh yes, the pawns.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.314
They are the front line.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.916
They will be casualties.

25:54.319 --> 25:56.520
<i>This crap's boring, man.</i>

25:56.522 --> 25:58.489
Kids game.

25:58.491 --> 25:59.723
What you reading?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.227
Let me put it to you this way,

26:03.229 --> 26:06.363
a way you'll understand.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.365
Think about it like this.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.833
Who's your supplier?

26:09.835 --> 26:11.869
Hey, you tripping.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.138
Hey, I know you ain't growing
that weed you're selling

26:14.140 --> 26:16.640
and so does everybody else in
here you're trying to sell it to.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.375
So, who's your guy?
Huh?

26:18.377 --> 26:21.979
<i>Your ace in the hole.</i>

26:21.981 --> 26:23.647
Trying to protect your king.
I like that.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.282
Okay.
All right.

26:25.284 --> 26:30.454
Well, then let's
call this king, "Perry."

26:30.456 --> 26:32.923
King Perry it is.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.326
Now, King Perry has an army
and you're a part of it.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.161
But the problem is,

26:37.163 --> 26:39.363
you think you're out there
doing the king's business,

26:39.365 --> 26:42.299
all you're really doing
is sacrificing yourself.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.601
Like the pawn you truly are.

26:43.603 --> 26:44.969
It ain't like that, B.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.371
It's exactly like that, partner.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.174
Now, if you want to keep making the
same mistakes for a king who could

26:50.176 --> 26:54.244
care less about your ass, out
there is the board to do it on.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.447
But if you want to learn how
to make the right maneuvers,

26:56.449 --> 26:59.283
this is where you do it.
Right here on this board.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.721
So, what do you want,
what do you want to do?

27:03.723 --> 27:05.489
You want to learn how to play?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.658
Played out, man.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.026
I'll play.
Me, too.

27:12.530 --> 27:14.431
There it is.

27:14.433 --> 27:15.666
Very nice.

27:23.041 --> 27:26.043
Man, Peanut, that
ain't the right move.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.745
Use the horse,
it moves in and out.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.749
Right there.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.684
No, man, right...
What, are you blind, man?

27:33.686 --> 27:36.587
Tahime, why don't you
play your own game?

27:36.589 --> 27:38.088
Man, I'm just watching.

27:40.592 --> 27:41.859
How did you see that attack?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.827
What you mean "see?"

27:43.829 --> 27:45.562
It's obvious.

27:45.564 --> 27:46.964
Peanut's just stupid.

28:01.379 --> 28:02.880
<i>Hey, Mr. Brown.</i>

28:02.882 --> 28:04.481
Hey, what you doing?

28:04.483 --> 28:06.383
Going to get a ride, man.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.285
Don't ride with that fool.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.787
I'd rather walk.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.192
Let's go.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.310
It's right up here.

28:36.081 --> 28:37.881
Oh, man.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.751
That's T's mama.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.252
You all live here?

28:42.254 --> 28:45.756
Yeah. T eats
at my place every night.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.091
His mama don't cook.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.760
She's real messed up, man.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.396
Yeah.

28:52.398 --> 28:56.100
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Brown.
Anytime, son.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.501
Take care of yourself.

29:27.699 --> 29:29.666
No, no, Marco.
Marco, please.

29:29.668 --> 29:31.702
Please, man.
Have a seat.

29:31.704 --> 29:34.171
Come on, man.
Please.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.415
Thank you.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.050
Thank you, son.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.021
Did you get any of my letters?

29:56.161 --> 29:58.328
I've been out
for a couple weeks now.

30:02.233 --> 30:06.904
I've been teaching these kids chess
down in the old neighborhood.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.173
I got this one kid
that reminds me of you.

30:09.175 --> 30:12.276
Who the hell
do you think you are?

30:12.278 --> 30:15.212
You never taught me nothing.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.749
You're the last person that
has a right to be talking.

30:18.751 --> 30:20.484
Okay. Okay.

30:22.887 --> 30:24.254
Guard.
No, Marco.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.023
Marco, wait.
No, Marco, wait.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.858
No, wait, son.
Don't be like that. Son.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.092
Please.

30:39.204 --> 30:42.306
Everybody, look up here.
You see this?

30:42.308 --> 30:45.075
There's an open tournament in
Virginia in a couple of months.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.844
We're not ready
for no tournament.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.613
That might be true
and that might not be.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.949
But one thing's for sure is
you're never going to find out

30:51.951 --> 30:54.184
if you don't give it a try.

30:54.186 --> 30:58.856
If anybody wants to road trip,
there will be a sign up sheet.

30:58.858 --> 31:02.626
I ain't trying
to be white, man.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.927
Fine, white goes first.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.963
White goes first.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.565
See, that shows you
how stupid this game is.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.869
Hell yeah, black always got to go first.
Amen.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.475
T, you could be
one hell of a player.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.078
But your problem and everyone
else in this room's problem

31:21.080 --> 31:23.046
is you don't
give a damn about rules.

31:24.682 --> 31:26.016
Especially you.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.058
What's the word?

31:35.060 --> 31:37.027
You got my money?

31:49.407 --> 31:51.008
I know it's not
as much as usual...

31:51.010 --> 31:53.810
You damn straight
it's not as much.

31:53.812 --> 31:54.578
Sales are down.

31:59.183 --> 32:01.151
Sales are down?

32:01.153 --> 32:03.020
What, you an economist
now, negro?

32:08.092 --> 32:10.394
You know Eugene Brown?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.062
Yeah.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.997
Yeah, I know Eugene Brown.
He's my man.

32:13.999 --> 32:16.166
Well, your man
is stealing your business.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.504
'Cause I'm just saying.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.607
And he runs detention
over at Maud Alton now.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.823
He telling the kids not
to buy from me anymore.

32:25.849 --> 32:26.376
Hold up.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.545
Eugene Brown runs detention?

32:31.950 --> 32:33.483
That's hilarious.

32:36.387 --> 32:37.654
Man, get the hell out of here.

32:40.825 --> 32:41.458
<i>Hey.</i>

32:45.964 --> 32:48.765
You better start turning
over more product.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.667
Or I'm not even going to
think about coming up

32:50.669 --> 32:53.603
with that big job I've
been telling you about.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.538
Understand me?

32:57.742 --> 32:58.642
Go.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.815
Darius.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.316
Who do you know
over at Maud Alton

33:06.318 --> 33:09.686
that can do Uncle Perry
a little favor?

33:28.239 --> 33:30.741
<i>Hold on. Hold on.
Next time...</i>

33:30.743 --> 33:35.312
<i>I'm going to get two pieces.</i>

33:40.818 --> 33:42.986
Shut the door up.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.421
Get out.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.922
<i>What the hell?</i>

33:45.924 --> 33:48.658
<i>Tahime, baby.</i>

33:50.396 --> 33:52.662
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait. Wait.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.431
Damon's just my friend.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.800
I'm going to make some dinner.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.535
I got some spaghetti.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.204
Oh, baby.
I don't want to be here.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.030
Barging in like that.
What's wrong with you?

34:03.056 --> 34:04.408
You don't talk to him.
Get out!

34:04.410 --> 34:06.676
What's wrong with you?
Don't go. Where are you going?

34:06.678 --> 34:08.110
Come back at 9:00, okay?

34:08.112 --> 34:09.579
Got to go to school
in the morning.

34:11.815 --> 34:16.887
In here, you're either teaching
lessons or you're learning them.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.621
You must think before you move.

34:20.158 --> 34:22.092
<i>Hey, Peanut.</i>

34:22.094 --> 34:23.592
What are you doing?
What did I just say?

34:23.594 --> 34:25.328
Think before you make
your next move.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.429
And you didn't.

34:28.132 --> 34:31.701
Y'all got to start
paying attention, man.

34:31.703 --> 34:34.103
In here and in life.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.606
'Cause out in the streets,
it's not checkmate.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.574
It's incarceration.
It's wheelchair.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.110
Man, I can't take
much more of this.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.710
Peanut, get up, bro.

34:43.981 --> 34:45.449
I got you.

34:52.255 --> 34:54.091
You want to start over?

34:54.092 --> 34:54.757
I got him beat.

34:57.695 --> 34:59.396
No.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.230
Go.

35:01.232 --> 35:02.799
This is all I need.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.258
<i>Check.</i>

36:14.572 --> 36:15.739
Checkmate.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.409
Hey.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.745
Where did you
learn how to do that?

36:21.747 --> 36:24.814
Told you, it's just
a simple stupid game, man.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.971
Got something I want to talk
to you about, all right, man?

36:40.997 --> 36:41.665
What's up?

36:41.667 --> 36:44.067
Can't tell nobody, all right?
I won't.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.068
I'm serious.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.336
I won't.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.707
Me and Cliff, we got some
real things going on.

36:52.009 --> 36:52.876
Real easy money.

36:54.445 --> 36:57.247
And I want you
in on it with me.

36:57.249 --> 36:59.349
What you want me to do?

36:59.351 --> 37:01.218
Try it.
Just in case, you know?

37:03.154 --> 37:04.888
All I got to do is roll?

37:04.890 --> 37:06.456
Yeah, man.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.760
You trust me?

37:10.762 --> 37:13.763
I trust you.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.232
I want you in on this with me.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.367
For real.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.004
All right.
My man.

37:23.975 --> 37:27.143
Okay, so, that-that's...
I got it put away this time.

37:27.145 --> 37:28.878
It's a whole body throw.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.714
Nothing, 'cause you
about to airball it.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.350
Oh, I did it.
I'm a beast.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.392
Oh, man. I'm a beast.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.085
I told you.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.386
You're right on the ball.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.263
Ms. King, you said
you wanted to see me?

37:46.265 --> 37:48.772
Oh, yes, I-I-I did. Come on in.
Have a seat.

37:48.798 --> 37:49.424
<i>Okay.</i>

37:54.238 --> 37:55.939
This isn't easy for me.

37:59.477 --> 38:00.442
Who gave you this?

38:00.468 --> 38:03.446
Someone dropped it in my
mailbox yesterday afternoon.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.715
Listen, I'm not the same
man I was back then.

38:08.486 --> 38:09.919
You lied to me, Mr. Brown.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.822
I have to let you go.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.164
You should see these kids, man.
They're learning.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.832
I'm against
the wall here, though,

38:22.834 --> 38:24.834
and I don't have a choice.
I'm sorry.

38:32.710 --> 38:36.246
Chess is no different
than life.

38:36.248 --> 38:41.251
These suburban kids, they
know they get good grades,

38:41.253 --> 38:43.420
they go off to college.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.056
They know they're going to own
their own business someday.

38:46.058 --> 38:47.791
They envision the end game.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.726
But poor kids
don't think like that.

38:49.728 --> 38:52.295
Mr. Brown, I...
I wasn't taught like that.

38:52.297 --> 38:53.730
I didn't... I didn't
see the end game

38:53.732 --> 38:55.198
and it cost me, man.
It cost me big.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.333
I know.

38:59.370 --> 39:03.473
I am still here for you
and the chess program.

39:05.042 --> 39:06.376
Just not in the school.

39:08.412 --> 39:09.746
Not anymore.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.124
Hey, Mr. Brown.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.293
Get back to class, Peanut.

39:23.295 --> 39:24.861
You mad at me?

39:24.863 --> 39:26.596
No.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.899
But chess club is cancelled.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.969
What? Why?

39:32.971 --> 39:34.971
Politics.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.272
Politics?

39:36.274 --> 39:38.641
Man, that's an excuse.

39:38.643 --> 39:41.010
What about fighting
our way out of a corner?

39:45.416 --> 39:46.916
What was I thinking, man?

39:49.153 --> 39:51.087
Chess.

40:11.509 --> 40:13.977
I don't think you guys
want to buy in.

40:19.718 --> 40:22.585
<i>Take all that money.
I'm going to raise you again.</i>

40:29.193 --> 40:31.961
<i>All right,</i>
<i>put some more money down.</i>

40:33.497 --> 40:35.198
<i>Oh, that's not bad.</i>

40:35.200 --> 40:36.833
<i>Give me my three already.</i>
<i>No.</i>

40:39.503 --> 40:41.604
Oh, snap.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.642
Mean Gene Brown.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.143
The one with the frown.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.546
So, what's up, man?

40:49.548 --> 40:52.582
Guess I just had
to see this place again.

40:52.584 --> 40:55.819
Word on the street
is you lost your job.

40:55.821 --> 40:59.823
Look, it's hard out
there for an ex-con.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.358
And the system's
not even set up

41:02.360 --> 41:04.794
to support going straight.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.930
That's just the world, baby,

41:06.932 --> 41:10.400
trying to keep another
beautiful black man down.

41:12.437 --> 41:15.438
That's all right, though, because
I'm going to help you out.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.773
I owe you at least that.

41:21.779 --> 41:24.380
Why are you looking at
me like that, Mean Gene?

41:24.382 --> 41:25.648
Huh?

41:25.650 --> 41:27.550
All right.
All right.

41:27.552 --> 41:29.986
There you go.

41:29.988 --> 41:34.123
Oh, oh, you don't have
to do nothing for this.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.191
It's on the house.

41:38.562 --> 41:40.797
You just don't get it, brother.

41:40.799 --> 41:44.300
I'm one of the pillars
in this community now.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.536
Look, I help these folks out.

41:46.538 --> 41:50.773
The way that the government don't
have the time or the means to.

41:50.775 --> 41:53.276
I'm going to help you out
a little bit, too.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.677
Come on, baby.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.047
Come on home.

42:10.628 --> 42:13.029
It's always good
chatting with you, Perry.

42:17.234 --> 42:18.835
See you soon, Gene.

42:21.505 --> 42:22.805
See you real soon.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.091
Hey, yo.

42:42.093 --> 42:44.961
Anybody want to come to the park
and play some chess with me?

42:47.665 --> 42:50.266
Hey, janitor,
that was detention.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.368
We had to be there.

42:52.370 --> 42:54.804
You don't even
work here no more.

42:54.806 --> 42:57.607
Hey, T, you want
to waste your potential, too?

42:57.609 --> 42:58.241
<i>Huh?</i>

43:00.110 --> 43:01.244
Come on, man.

43:04.214 --> 43:06.015
Yo, Peanut.

43:06.017 --> 43:08.985
Let's go get a game at the park, man.
Come on.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.354
No, man.
I don't like the politics.

43:11.356 --> 43:13.723
Oh, it's like that?

43:37.548 --> 43:38.881
Nicely done.

43:44.388 --> 43:45.788
What's up with Tahime?

43:45.790 --> 43:48.124
Why is he so attached
to Clifton?

43:48.126 --> 43:51.761
Well, you know, Clifton was always
the biggest kid in the class.

43:51.763 --> 43:55.064
It's been like that
since we was babies.

43:55.066 --> 43:57.233
And T, man, he's just as scared
to be on the streets as me,

43:57.235 --> 44:02.572
but he's not going
to say nothing.

44:02.574 --> 44:03.773
You're a good man, Peanut.

44:07.678 --> 44:11.280
And this is for you.

44:11.282 --> 44:12.782
It's official.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.550
You're president
of the chess club.

44:14.552 --> 44:16.386
Chess club?

44:16.388 --> 44:18.488
It's just you and me.

44:18.490 --> 44:19.822
We don't even have
a homeroom, man.

44:19.824 --> 44:20.923
Everybody has that.

44:27.464 --> 44:29.666
Well, it is what it is.

44:29.668 --> 44:31.801
It's beautiful.

44:31.803 --> 44:33.603
It's where it's all
going to happen.

44:33.605 --> 44:35.238
What's going to happen?

44:35.240 --> 44:35.905
A bonfire?

44:37.374 --> 44:40.043
You got to have
a little vision, Peanut.

44:40.045 --> 44:42.078
Sure, it needs some work.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.913
But when I look at this place,

44:43.915 --> 44:46.315
I see a mansion
of possibilities.

45:02.267 --> 45:03.833
Hello?

45:03.835 --> 45:05.735
<i>Katrina, it's your father.</i>

45:05.737 --> 45:06.769
I can't talk right now.

45:06.771 --> 45:08.771
Oh, I understand.

45:08.773 --> 45:09.472
Maybe later.

45:12.643 --> 45:14.077
Is everything all right?

45:14.079 --> 45:17.180
Oh no, yeah, everything's fine.

45:17.182 --> 45:20.083
I just...

45:20.085 --> 45:21.951
you know, I want...
I wanted to tell you

45:21.953 --> 45:24.087
that I was...
I'm thinking about opening up

45:24.089 --> 45:26.355
a community chess house.

45:26.357 --> 45:28.691
<i>There's some pretty good</i>
<i>little players at that school.</i>

45:28.693 --> 45:31.527
A chess house? How are you going
to be able to afford that?

45:31.529 --> 45:33.362
Well, I've been...

45:33.364 --> 45:36.165
I've been
looking around a little bit.

45:36.167 --> 45:38.401
A lot of these houses
have been foreclosed on.

45:38.403 --> 45:40.670
I can probably rent one
for next to nothing.

45:40.672 --> 45:45.108
<i>You know, Billy</i>
<i>lent me some money already.</i>

45:45.110 --> 45:49.278
Katrina, I know things aren't
exactly right between us.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.013
<i>But maybe they can be</i>
<i>for those kids.</i>

45:52.883 --> 45:57.086
Since when do you care
so much about kids, Eugene?

45:57.088 --> 45:59.255
Since I lost you.

46:05.896 --> 46:08.831
To refresh, ladies, pawns
can move two spots

46:08.833 --> 46:10.566
or one...

46:13.137 --> 46:16.305
How goes it, gentlemen?

46:16.307 --> 46:18.241
Nice place you got
here, chess man.

46:18.243 --> 46:20.409
Did it come with asbestos?

46:20.411 --> 46:22.278
Hey, if you're not
here to help, Clifton,

46:22.280 --> 46:24.013
you're more than
welcome to leave.

46:24.015 --> 46:25.782
Oh, that's cool,
we just came for Peanut.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.283
Peanut?
Peanut is...

46:27.285 --> 46:28.985
He ain't going nowhere.
He's working.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.420
Working for who?
For you?

46:31.422 --> 46:33.723
Peanut, he paying you?

46:33.725 --> 46:35.792
Come on, Cliff.
No, you got W2s?

46:35.794 --> 46:37.393
I mean, was there
an interview process?

46:37.395 --> 46:39.328
Let me see your resume.
Please. Come on.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.430
Yo, if he don't want to go,
man, just let him stay.

46:41.432 --> 46:42.331
No, he's coming.

46:43.367 --> 46:44.600
Let's go.

46:44.602 --> 46:46.469
I just told you he stays.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.604
Now, if you want to throw
your life away, so be it.

46:48.606 --> 46:49.939
But he's with me.

46:52.476 --> 46:53.662
What's up, son? Hey, hey, hey.

46:53.688 --> 46:54.610
It's cool, it's cool.

46:54.612 --> 46:57.446
You don't want this. You don't want it.
It's cool.

46:57.448 --> 46:58.481
Please.

47:05.689 --> 47:08.591
I'm here for you, son.

47:08.593 --> 47:09.358
<i>Hear me?</i>

47:38.655 --> 47:40.122
Flash your lights.

47:42.492 --> 47:43.960
Think they're still...

47:52.402 --> 47:53.536
All right.

47:54.905 --> 47:56.239
Now, T, you come with me.

47:56.241 --> 47:57.707
Peanut, stay with the car.

47:57.709 --> 47:59.242
Alone?

47:59.244 --> 48:00.977
Alone?

48:00.979 --> 48:03.746
Little PB don't want
to stay alone?

48:03.748 --> 48:06.315
All right, T,
you stay with the car.

48:06.317 --> 48:08.517
Peanut, you bring
your simple self with me.

48:08.519 --> 48:10.920
Yo, Cliff, I don't think
that's such a good...

48:10.946 --> 48:11.545
Shut up.

48:20.297 --> 48:22.031
Stay focused, man, all right?

48:23.867 --> 48:25.268
<i>Let's go, Peanut.</i>

48:30.741 --> 48:33.009
You have to envision
the end game.

48:34.711 --> 48:37.713
Anytime you find
yourself behind,

48:37.715 --> 48:39.548
your mind got you there.

48:42.386 --> 48:44.887
When we get up there
you know I do the talking, right?

48:44.889 --> 48:46.589
Don't trip.
I got you.

48:48.825 --> 48:50.626
Yo, what's up?
What y'all got?

48:55.899 --> 48:58.734
No.

48:58.736 --> 49:01.003
This is the king.

49:01.005 --> 49:03.439
The king is your life.

49:03.441 --> 49:05.207
One mistake...

49:05.209 --> 49:07.176
I-I don't
got the cash, bro.

49:07.178 --> 49:08.577
And it can be taken.

50:09.606 --> 50:11.273
Get up, man.

50:12.042 --> 50:13.309
Get up.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.288
Peanut, man.

50:27.391 --> 50:28.858
There's that thinking.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.126
Ooh.

50:33.364 --> 50:36.699
I can see if you're
cheating me from over here.

50:36.701 --> 50:38.200
Big Chair Chess Club.

50:41.138 --> 50:43.606
You stay right there.
I'm on my way.

50:58.488 --> 51:00.356
Tahime.

51:00.358 --> 51:00.756
Hey.

51:01.958 --> 51:04.360
What's up?

51:04.362 --> 51:08.164
What's going on, man?
Where's Peanut?

51:08.166 --> 51:10.833
Oh, man.
What did you do?

51:10.835 --> 51:12.501
Huh?
Hey, hey.

51:12.503 --> 51:14.737
What did you do, man?

51:14.739 --> 51:15.938
What's going on?

51:15.940 --> 51:18.040
Talk to me.

51:18.042 --> 51:20.509
Talk to me, man.
What's going on?

51:29.619 --> 51:30.753
I got you.

51:31.888 --> 51:33.389
I got you, son.

51:56.913 --> 51:59.348
Girls left the door unlocked.

53:02.646 --> 53:03.546
Hi.

53:03.548 --> 53:04.313
Tahime.

53:06.850 --> 53:07.950
How are you doing?

53:11.288 --> 53:12.855
I'm going to miss him, too.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.159
He was always really sweet.

53:17.161 --> 53:18.694
I don't know about all that.

53:20.063 --> 53:21.564
Ooh.

53:21.566 --> 53:21.964
Yo, T.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.267
<i>Yo, let's ride, man.</i>

53:25.269 --> 53:27.136
We're going down to Spiders.

53:27.138 --> 53:28.237
I'm good.

53:30.173 --> 53:33.576
Look, man, I miss
the little guy, too.

53:33.578 --> 53:35.878
But that's how life is
on these streets, man.

53:37.881 --> 53:39.748
<i>I'm going to make</i>
<i>the run myself this time.</i>

53:41.551 --> 53:43.619
I hope we can
put this behind us.

53:44.721 --> 53:45.487
For your sake.

53:48.558 --> 53:49.758
What's up, Michelle?

53:50.961 --> 53:51.894
Stop.

54:08.044 --> 54:08.777
Are you okay?

54:19.789 --> 54:22.258
A young man is dead
because of me.

54:23.593 --> 54:25.194
I should have never let him go.

54:25.196 --> 54:26.829
It's not true and you know it.

54:36.339 --> 54:39.375
You know what?

54:39.377 --> 54:43.545
For the first time in my life, I
am actually very proud of you.

54:44.981 --> 54:48.517
You started something here.

54:48.519 --> 54:51.287
They don't listen, Trini.

54:51.289 --> 54:52.588
They don't listen.
I didn't.

54:52.590 --> 54:55.624
Your brother doesn't.

54:55.626 --> 54:59.495
They see that easy money as the
only way out, and you know what?

54:59.497 --> 55:03.666
Sometimes I don't blame them
for thinking that way.

55:03.668 --> 55:05.467
So you're just
going to give up?

55:05.469 --> 55:07.903
They think I'm nuts, okay?

55:07.905 --> 55:10.005
Trini, they think I'm looney.

55:10.007 --> 55:12.141
And you know what?
I'm starting to believe them.

55:12.143 --> 55:13.342
I'm starting to believe them.

55:13.344 --> 55:14.543
You ain't nuts.

55:17.714 --> 55:19.715
Clifton, he's nuts.
But you...

55:22.385 --> 55:23.085
You're all right.

55:34.364 --> 55:37.032
Where did you get this?

55:37.034 --> 55:39.968
Peanut had that in his hand
before the police came.

55:58.755 --> 56:00.122
Let's clean this place up, man.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.491
Yeah.

58:00.977 --> 58:03.412
This is a key.

58:03.414 --> 58:06.148
See that?

58:06.150 --> 58:07.716
This is how it works.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.018
Any questions?

58:47.223 --> 58:50.659
Man, what the hell you doing
waking me up, man?

58:50.661 --> 58:52.761
Don't you walk away from me.

58:52.763 --> 58:54.096
I ain't your mama.

59:02.305 --> 59:03.605
Oh, you want to fight.

59:03.607 --> 59:04.973
You want to...

59:29.599 --> 59:30.332
Hey.

59:33.369 --> 59:34.336
What's wrong?

59:37.574 --> 59:38.740
Tahime, talk to me.

59:40.209 --> 59:42.911
I'm going to kill
my mom's boyfriend.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.479
What?

59:44.481 --> 59:45.747
I'm going to get a gun

59:45.749 --> 59:47.082
and I'm going to shoot him.

59:49.018 --> 59:52.754
I don't care what happens to me.
I don't care.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.556
But he ain't going
to touch nobody no more,

59:54.558 --> 59:56.224
not me, not her, not nobody.

59:56.226 --> 59:58.994
I swear on God he ain't
going to touch nobody.

59:58.996 --> 01:00:02.431
What do you think
that's going to prove?

01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:05.500
I was locked up for 17 years...

01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:06.635
in prison.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:09.237
I just got out.

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:12.174
I spent almost
two decades in the joint.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:23.151
I blamed everything
on everybody else but me.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:26.588
I was just touching the pieces,

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:29.625
moving them whenever I could

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:32.094
without thought.

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:35.263
That's why none of y'all
can get nothing over on me.

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:38.934
Because I've done all the dumb
stuff that y'all have done twice.

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:42.270
Some of it three times.

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:43.171
What did you do?

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:46.308
Whatever I wanted to do.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.446
<i>I stole.</i>

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:52.681
I even ran a crew.

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.419
And they gave you
17 years for that?

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:58.987
No.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:03.291
I got my 17 years
for armed robbery.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.292
I robbed a bank.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:11.366
Cops came and we all scattered.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:18.073
And I took the fall.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.878
And then I learned.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.012
What did you learn?

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.380
I learned the board.

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:30.852
Your move.

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:32.821
Good.

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:34.823
Checkmate.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:36.191
Even better.

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:51.506
Thank you.
This chess house, it's...

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:52.708
it's amazing.

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:59.448
You know, eight years I've
been at Maud Alton and...

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:03.585
I've just been trying to make do
with what little money they give us.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:05.587
We're all doing
the best we can,

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:11.993
most of us high ups,
teachers, parents, kids.

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:17.132
In all my years I have seen very
few people make a real difference.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.237
These kids...

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:24.439
they need you.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.611
And your life before...

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:32.848
and who you have become now...

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.050
you inspire me,
Mr. Brown.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:39.454
You really do.

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.333
It's really coming together.

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:54.603
This Tahime Sanders is a beast.
I talked to Marco last week.

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:55.871
Really?

01:02:55.873 --> 01:02:58.073
He's coming home early.

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.074
Wow.

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:00.442
Wow, that's good news.

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:04.212
Can I drive you to pick him up?

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:09.351
I don't know.
Oh, no, no.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:11.853
Trini, you got to...
you got to do this for me.

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:13.455
It would mean a lot to me.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.757
I got to be there for him
when he gets out.

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:17.559
Show him how much I changed.

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:18.493
Please.

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:22.063
Sunday.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.834
That's what I'm talking about.

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:49.090
That's nice.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.162
He in a better place
now, anyways.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.197
Yeah.

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:56.998
You all right?

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:03.205
You know you got a ticket
out of this place, Tahime.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:06.274
You could be a special
player, a real pro.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.243
Just need the discipline.

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:11.112
Check this out.

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.116
This could be you.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.522
Maurice Ashley did it.
Who's to say you couldn't be next?

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:21.556
Maurice who?

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:22.891
Ah.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:26.228
Maurice Ashley from Harlem

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.897
was the first
African-American grandmaster.

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:29.666
So, what?

01:04:29.692 --> 01:04:32.734
You're telling me your
brother's a grandmaster?

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:35.036
Who's to say
there could only be one?

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:37.839
Why ain't you one?

01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:40.041
If I had your natural
talent, I would be.

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:45.547
Come on, man.

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.349
I ain't about to be
embarrassing myself

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:49.150
in some white man's competition.

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:51.253
You going to think that way
your entire life?

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.588
Every time you get
an opportunity,

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:56.825
you're going to run away
just because you're scared?

01:04:56.827 --> 01:04:58.093
I ain't scared.

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:01.696
T, you have a real talent.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:04.833
And that'll take you further
than any money, race, class

01:05:04.835 --> 01:05:06.902
any day of the week.

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:08.570
You could play
with these kids, man.

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.408
And if I can't?

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.944
It ain't about whether
you can or you can't,

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:19.381
it's about whether
you will or you won't.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:20.415
Believe that.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.700
Where the hell you been,
Tahime?

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:40.702
I was out...

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:41.336
with Mr. Brown.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.110
I want you to do
something for me, okay?

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.615
I want you to sign
this consent form

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:56.284
so I can play in a chess tournament.
Chess tournament?

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.787
What the hell
you talking about?

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:00.758
I told you, I've been
getting real good at chess.

01:06:00.784 --> 01:06:02.057
Give me a damn break, Tahime.

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:04.359
You out there playing
some dumb ass game

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:06.828
while the rest of us sitting
in here trying to survive.

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.196
It ain't a dumb game.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:10.465
Is it a job?
You getting paid?

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.200
Because if you
ain't getting paid,

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.635
I don't want to hear
nothing about it.

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:19.240
Silly.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:22.358
If I'm good...

01:06:22.384 --> 01:06:25.213
Boy, you ain't good at nothing
but being a pain in my ass.

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:27.682
Get-get out my face.
Go on.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:30.051
Go on.
Get out of my face.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:34.522
How the hell you think you can afford
to be in somebody chess contest?

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:37.859
<i>You think they let fools
like you in for free?</i>

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:40.595
Mr. Brown said he'd pay.
<i>Oh, hell no, he ain't.</i>

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:44.032
And you ain't going to be
in no chess contest, either.

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:46.267
No chess contest.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.636
Mr. Brown.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.384
Come on.

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:12.660
Mr. Brown, I presume.
Yes, sir.

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:14.529
Jerry Simpson,
assistant coordinator.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.097
It's a pleasure
to have you here.

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.199
It's a pleasure
to be here, sir.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.568
What are...

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:23.071
What are all the computers for?
That's how we play chess here.

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.973
It's the way of the future.

01:07:24.975 --> 01:07:27.842
I trust you've used them?

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:28.910
Yes, sir.

01:07:28.912 --> 01:07:31.046
Computers.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:33.748
All right, I want you to concentrate
and picture your end game.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.116
What's with the computers?

01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:36.851
A modern way of playing.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.821
Man, that's bull.
I want to play street style.

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:42.824
You are going to play on a
computer and behave, you hear me?

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:45.293
Now, listen.
No trash talking, no cursing.

01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:47.195
Just play your game.

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:48.797
No trash talking, no cursing?

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:50.465
That is my game.

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:52.267
They're ready to start.
You need to register.

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.601
Right. Right.

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:55.303
Give me your consent forms.

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.373
Good. Good. Good.

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:11.386
Hello.
I'm Eugene Brown.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:13.354
Registering my kids.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:20.929
And the eighth?
Here's the thing...

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.598
Actually, I left it in the
car, my registration.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.581
Is there any possible way you think
I could have enough time to go...

01:08:26.607 --> 01:08:27.402
If you're quick.

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:28.770
Thank you so much.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:06.474
All right, sir.
You're all set.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.308
Great.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.984
Eugene Brown.

01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:21.256
I'm Roy Woodbury, host a
talk program over at KCAM.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:23.892
♪ KCAM
Right. Yeah.

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:26.127
Yeah, I just wanted to come
by and tell you I heard about

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:28.696
what you're doing over there at that house.
It's good stuff.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.377
I got an assistant who
lives over that way.

01:09:30.404 --> 01:09:30.798
Oh, yeah?

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.134
Yeah.

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:34.536
Is he one of your students?

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.837
Yeah. Yeah.
Tahime Sanders.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.872
<i>Is he any good?</i>

01:09:37.874 --> 01:09:39.474
<i>Exceptional.</i>

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:43.111
Well, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:46.147
Oh, hey, sorry, I'm distracted.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:48.249
I haven't had jitters
like this in years.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:50.318
Come on, man,
that's the fun part.

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.863
Relax. Relax.
Think.

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:15.563
Checkmate.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:16.451
Checkmate. Yes!

01:12:16.477 --> 01:12:16.889
Yes!

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:19.267
All right.

01:12:19.269 --> 01:12:21.336
We have a problem.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:24.005
After reviewing some
of your students' forms,

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:26.941
it's fairly obvious that
one of them was forged.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:29.777
Now, Linda over at registration
alerted me to the fact that

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:31.913
initially you didn't have
some of these forms signed,

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:34.849
so I took a look at them,
and if you look,

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.585
this one clearly was not
signed by an adult.

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.321
Now, you forged a consent form,

01:12:40.323 --> 01:12:44.826
and failed to submit any of the
students' birth certificates.

01:12:44.828 --> 01:12:48.062
Can I talk to you for...
I'm comfortable talking right here.

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:50.965
Some of these kids
don't have birth certificates.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:52.667
Everybody's got
a birth certificate.

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:55.069
Not where we come from.

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:56.738
<i>Then it's done.</i>

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:00.074
I'm sorry, but rules are rules.

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:01.876
Alan wins.

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:04.045
<i>No.</i>

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:07.048
Wait.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.884
Eugene, that was
an absolute travesty.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:11.819
A crime.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.355
Wait.

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:16.599
Well, there's nothing we
can do about it right now.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.892
That's not necessarily true.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:20.528
Why don't you and Tahime come
on the air tomorrow morning?

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.397
State your case.

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:23.765
Get the word out
to the community.

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.906
For those of you
just tuning in,

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.675
we are joined in studio
by Tahime Sanders

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:37.044
and his coach, Eugene Brown,

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:39.113
who were robbed
of a chess championship

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:41.949
this past weekend
at a local tournament.

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:45.987
Now, tell us,
Tahime, what happened?

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:49.323
Shed some light on this most
egregious theft of a championship.

01:13:49.325 --> 01:13:52.326
It wasn't theft.

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:53.461
Come again?

01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:55.229
It was not theft.

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:59.200
The rules were the rules
and we didn't obey them.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:01.269
Mr. Brown,
I-I was there.

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:05.373
It is the job of Tahime
and every, every person

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:06.707
playing the game,
black or white,

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:08.376
to beat them at their own game.

01:14:08.378 --> 01:14:09.911
Their own rules.
We didn't do that.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:11.412
Mr. B, we won.

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:14.081
We can't change
the rules, Tahime.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:15.917
We have to learn
to win within them.

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.351
<i>That's what this is about.</i>

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:20.621
But isn't creating a champion

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:22.356
what this is all about?

01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:24.826
No, sir.
No, it's not.

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:28.262
It's about learning
how to play the game.

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:29.964
It's about changing minds.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:33.100
And, in turn,
learning about life.

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:36.270
The championship
isn't the end game.

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:38.005
<i>The championship</i>
<i>is a byproduct.</i>

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:43.478
All right, then.

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.682
There you have it.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:51.018
We'll be back in a minute,
plus weather and traffic.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:57.558
What the hell is wrong
with you, brother?

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.094
You come down here
just to sell your guy out?

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:01.262
On the air.

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:02.563
I was making a point.

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:04.165
Yeah, well, you did that.

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:51.579
<i>Tahime.</i>

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:54.248
It's Mr. Brown,
Tahime.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.518
What are you knocking for?
Tahime ain't here.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.240
You're who?

01:15:58.266 --> 01:16:01.122
Eugene Brown, ma'am. I'm
sorry to bother you.

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:02.690
But your son comes
to my chess house.

01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:05.560
Not anymore he don't.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:06.745
Please, Ms. San...

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:10.364
Listen, you go on and
hustle somebody else's kid.

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:11.799
Selling my baby all them lies,

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.734
he's going to be
a chess champion.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:16.504
And he going to go
to school for chess.

01:16:16.506 --> 01:16:18.406
You stay the hell away,
you hear me?

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.707
It ain't like that,
Ms. San...

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.609
I said, stay the hell away.

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:25.246
Ms. Sanders.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.115
Ms. Sanders.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.419
Your son is the real deal.

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:32.954
You need to come
and see him play.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:35.056
Hear me?

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:38.326
<i>I wasn't there for my kids</i>
<i>and I regret it every day.</i>

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:40.428
<i>Your son needs you.</i>

01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:41.696
<i>He needs you.</i>

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:49.303
<i>Hey, Mr. B.</i>

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.305
What you doing up here
at the Taj Mahal?

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:54.108
Y'all seen Tahime?
Yeah, he was with Clifton.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.744
They were around some other dudes
in a car I've never seen before.

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:58.546
He said he had a job
or something about a...

01:16:58.548 --> 01:16:59.647
the rec center.

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:00.915
Rec center, huh?

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:02.750
I think.
<i>All right.</i>

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:04.619
Hey, y'all come by
the chess house tomorrow.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.320
We're having a mini tournament.

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:08.322
All right, Mr. B.
Right.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.066
Tahime!

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:24.205
Hey, hey, hey,
y'all seen Tahime?

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:25.339
<i>No, I ain't seen him.</i>

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.607
You sure?

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:27.775
<i>Tahime who?</i>

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:30.044
Sanders.

01:17:42.524 --> 01:17:45.426
Come on, Tahime.
Come on, baby.

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:46.961
Come on, young king.

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:05.212
Come on.

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.014
Hey.

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:45.219
I think Tahime is in
some real trouble.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.189
It's amazing
because you're so good

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:50.124
at caring about
other people's kids

01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:53.127
and completely incapable
of caring about your own.

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.299
Marco.

01:18:58.301 --> 01:19:02.069
Oh, hey, man.
It's good to have you home.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.604
Marco.

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:04.805
Hey.

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:06.741
Hey.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.573
Tahime.

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:42.276
Where you been, man?
Huh?

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.579
You in trouble, son?
For what?

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:49.016
Don't "for what" me. I saw you get
arrested outside the rec center.

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:51.619
Man, I ain't get arrested.

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:53.988
That was Cliff
and some other guys.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:55.890
I thought you was with them.

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:57.458
I was.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.926
I was in the car, but...

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.196
Once I found out
what they was doing,

01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:03.798
I just thought before I moved.

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:11.472
I'm glad you made
the right decision.

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:14.508
I guess.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:17.578
You know, everybody else
says you're a phony.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:18.445
I know you're not.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.122
It's a bit much, son.

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:32.259
Some of these players
are rated 2,400 and up.

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:36.463
But it's in the district
and I want to play.

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:38.732
For me and...

01:20:38.734 --> 01:20:39.400
Peanut.

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:45.406
Well, come on in here and
help me move these boxes.

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:45.566
Yeah.

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:48.602
Yo, it's Clifton.

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:50.037
Clifton.

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:37.618
Surprise!

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:42.089
What's all this?

01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:43.657
What?
You forgot your own birthday?

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:44.959
How'd you know that?

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:52.499
Ms. King and I spent a couple
hours digging around city hall.

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:54.568
No more disqualifications.

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:59.039
This time we're going to beat
them at their own rules.

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:00.541
Come on, T.
Make a wish.

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:21.528
Really?

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:22.629
This place?

01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:25.799
Yeah, this place.

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:26.633
All right.

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.204
I'm going to go
run some errands.

01:23:30.206 --> 01:23:31.305
I'll be back.

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.042
Thank you, Katrina.

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:46.120
First off,
don't be mad at Trini.

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:48.722
She wanted no part of this.

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:59.566
I'm sorry I pissed away
the best years of my life.

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:06.940
And they weren't the best years
because I was a young man,

01:24:06.942 --> 01:24:12.646
they were the best years because
I hadn't ruined your trust yet.

01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:13.814
Man.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.351
I don't even know you.

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:22.823
I'm-I'm trying
to change that.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.061
I need you, son.

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:30.931
I love you, Marco.

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:33.067
I always will.

01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:35.235
No matter what.

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:41.809
Hi, Ms. Reavis.

01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:44.578
Principal King said I can
make an announcement?

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:47.981
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

01:24:47.983 --> 01:24:51.585
<i>I would like to announce</i>
<i>our very own Tahime Sanders</i>

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.854
<i>will be participating</i>
<i>in the Eastern Champion...</i>

01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:56.590
<i>Open Chess Tournament</i>
<i>this upcoming Sunday.</i>

01:24:56.592 --> 01:25:02.229
Everyone is encouraged to come on
down and watch him kick some...

01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:05.065
watch him dominate
the competition.

01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:07.301
Oh, yeah.
My man.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.374
I got somebody
I want you to meet.

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:36.530
Family.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.066
You good?

01:25:39.068 --> 01:25:41.168
I'm good.

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:42.369
You look good.

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:46.140
This the boy you told me about?

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:48.108
Yes, sir.

01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:50.244
This here is the chess man.

01:25:50.246 --> 01:25:51.545
Taught me everything I know

01:25:51.547 --> 01:25:53.180
right here in these walls.

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:57.151
So, Tahime.

01:25:57.153 --> 01:25:58.085
You good, I hear.

01:25:58.087 --> 01:25:59.419
Real good.

01:25:59.421 --> 01:26:02.789
Unstudied, undisciplined.

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:03.857
Talking to him?

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.167
Big tournament, huh?

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:18.071
You ready?

01:26:18.073 --> 01:26:18.983
As I'll ever be.

01:26:19.009 --> 01:26:21.942
Son, these cats are quick,
you got to be quicker.

01:26:21.944 --> 01:26:25.012
And because of what you look
like, all eyes will be on you.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:27.748
So you got to think tough.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:28.415
Huh?

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:32.252
Now, this kid...

01:26:32.254 --> 01:26:35.556
J. Thomas Gaines...

01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:38.592
I wish I had a shot at him.

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:41.728
I got me a list
of his last 300 matches.

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:44.164
Got it sent to me
by a chess magazine,

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:46.300
felt bad that
I was all locked up.

01:26:46.302 --> 01:26:47.734
Free subscription for life.

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:55.175
If you face off
with this Gaines,

01:26:55.177 --> 01:26:57.811
he's got one particular move

01:26:57.813 --> 01:27:01.048
that leaves him vulnerable,
almost without fail.

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:02.849
Amazing how nobody
found it before.

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:05.919
But then again,
nobody's got as much time

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:08.121
on their hands as I do.

01:27:08.123 --> 01:27:10.691
So, listen carefully.

01:27:10.693 --> 01:27:13.927
You know he will relentlessly
pound you with his queen.

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:16.763
I know.

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:21.201
Know what?

01:27:21.203 --> 01:27:23.070
Look, I appreciate all this.

01:27:23.072 --> 01:27:27.341
I really do.
I just...

01:27:27.343 --> 01:27:28.909
This is something
I have to by myself.

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.688
Respect.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.659
Anything else, then?

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.396
You ever getting out of here?

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:58.772
Only my mind gets out...

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.540
every time
I open up that board...

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:05.412
every time I open up a bible.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.653
And it will be out when you are
playing in that tournament.

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:35.342
Tahime Sanders checking in.

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:37.644
Okay.

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:39.179
Put him in this section.

01:28:39.181 --> 01:28:40.013
Yup.

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:42.983
Good luck, son.

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:52.926
You recognize that face?

01:28:52.928 --> 01:28:55.228
J. Thomas Gaines, huh?

01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:56.363
The one and only.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.894
Hey, Tahime.

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:33.033
Concentrate here.

01:29:33.035 --> 01:29:34.368
Women weaken legs.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.204
It's chess.

01:29:37.206 --> 01:29:39.906
What do I need my legs for?

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:41.375
Concentrate here.

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:53.387
<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

01:29:53.389 --> 01:29:57.157
<i>And welcome to the Washington, D.C.
Chess Open.</i>

01:29:57.159 --> 01:30:00.961
<i>As is customary, please shake
your opponent's hand.</i>

01:30:00.963 --> 01:30:02.262
<i>Very good.</i>

01:30:02.264 --> 01:30:03.897
<i>Now, start your clocks.</i>

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.046
Yes.

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:25.952
You know you could've had him
on the tenth move, right?

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:27.521
Relax, chess man.

01:30:27.523 --> 01:30:29.122
I'm just getting warmed up.

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:41.735
This guy is good.

01:30:41.737 --> 01:30:43.336
Mm.

01:30:43.338 --> 01:30:46.039
Can Tahime beat this guy?

01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:48.742
Well, he's been
one of the best players

01:30:48.744 --> 01:30:52.212
in the country since he was 15.

01:30:52.214 --> 01:30:53.980
Anybody can be beat.

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.150
Even Gaines.

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:12.826
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>our two undefeated players,</i>

01:32:12.828 --> 01:32:15.929
<i>J. Thomas Gaines</i>
<i>and Tahime Sanders.</i>

01:32:15.931 --> 01:32:18.365
<i>will engage</i>
<i>in an Armageddon tiebreaker</i>

01:32:18.367 --> 01:32:21.501
<i>to determine</i>
<i>our chess open champion.</i>

01:32:21.503 --> 01:32:23.803
<i>Gentlemen, good luck.</i>

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:04.638
Check.

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:35.168
Hey.

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:13.406
That's my baby.

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:15.809
<i>My baby.</i>

01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:48.041
Thank you.

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:53.346
You done good.

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:56.336
Mr. Brown? My name is Danielle
Norton with Urban League.

01:35:56.362 --> 01:35:57.083
Yes, ma'am.

01:35:57.085 --> 01:35:59.953
This Tahime, has he made
any college plans yet?

01:35:59.955 --> 01:36:01.755
Because I'd like to help.

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:04.891
I'll be in touch.

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:13.199
Hey, that's the first time
I've been scared all year.

01:36:13.201 --> 01:36:15.835
You ain't got to try and make me
feel better. You know that, right?

01:36:15.837 --> 01:36:18.371
Trust me.
I wouldn't do that.

01:36:18.373 --> 01:36:19.439
Ever.

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:23.176
Hey, can I grab you
for a quick photo over here?

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.146
Mr. Brown.

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:34.053
Ready, guys?

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:45.231
<i>Got to touch the king first.</i>

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:07.120
Dad.

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:16.663
Glad you could make it.

01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:19.365
Yeah, well, you know.
Thought I'd just check it out.

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:22.502
I'm happy to see you, son.

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.008
Let me show you around.

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:34.314
All right.

01:37:34.316 --> 01:37:35.748
Boards.

01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:36.850
Next champions.

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:39.784
Back here we have the kitchen.
