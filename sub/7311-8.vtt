WEBVTT

00:41.106 --> 00:43.636
Can I help you?

00:43.926 --> 00:46.282
Had a heck of a time finding this place.

00:46.306 --> 00:48.492
You know you guys don't
have any numbers out here?

00:48.516 --> 00:50.062
We don't get deliveries.

00:50.086 --> 00:52.062
Well, today you do.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.486
You guys, uh, mind giving
me a hand with this?

00:58.696 --> 01:00.642
Did this go through
secure Naval channels?

01:00.666 --> 01:01.972
Has it been scanned?

01:01.996 --> 01:03.322
What's inside?

01:03.346 --> 01:05.936
Only one way to find out.

01:07.616 --> 01:10.526
Welcome to the 21st Century.

01:12.546 --> 01:14.322
It's clean for hazardous materials.

01:14.346 --> 01:15.522
It's not ordnance.
Go ahead and crack it.

01:15.546 --> 01:18.596
Sir... all right.

01:22.046 --> 01:25.716
Great, if I can just have
you sign right here...

01:26.596 --> 01:28.172
Who sent this?

01:28.196 --> 01:31.546
I don't know. Why?

02:07.356 --> 02:10.092
Come on. Come on, ring.

02:10.116 --> 02:12.102
You know what they say
about a watched pot, Tony.

02:12.126 --> 02:14.162
Calls the kettle black?

02:14.186 --> 02:16.746
Never boils.

02:19.476 --> 02:21.072
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

02:21.096 --> 02:23.482
Just want to make sure it's working.

02:23.506 --> 02:26.382
This... is serious, McGee.

02:26.406 --> 02:29.232
This is game time. This is the
moment before the gun. Focus.

02:29.256 --> 02:31.732
Guess everyone handles the
pressure in their own way.

02:31.756 --> 02:34.892
You could use a little
tension-breaker, Tony. Relax.

02:34.916 --> 02:36.142
Relax? You're telling me to relax?

02:36.166 --> 02:38.552
Would Red Auerbach tell
Bill Russell to relax?

02:38.576 --> 02:39.712
I don't know.

02:39.736 --> 02:41.592
William Felton Russell.

02:41.616 --> 02:44.522
Five-time MVP. Greatest
basketball champion ever.

02:44.546 --> 02:47.812
Used to get so nervous, so pumped,
he had to throw up before every game.

02:47.836 --> 02:52.502
You have chosen to model your behavior
after a man who vomited on a regular basis?

02:52.526 --> 02:54.972
Nine titles in 11 seasons.

02:54.996 --> 02:56.212
Hall of Fame.

02:56.236 --> 02:58.472
One night, the Celtics take the court.

02:58.496 --> 03:00.402
It's a big game. Huge.

03:00.426 --> 03:04.182
Red's watching them warm up from the
sidelines, but something's not right.

03:04.206 --> 03:05.472
He can tell.

03:05.496 --> 03:06.632
They're not clicking.

03:06.656 --> 03:09.222
He clears the floor, takes them
all back down to the locker room.

03:09.246 --> 03:13.452
Why? Because Russell didn't throw up.

03:13.476 --> 03:15.132
You know what Red says next?

03:15.156 --> 03:17.232
Get in there and puke.
We got a game to win.

03:17.256 --> 03:18.152
Tip-off?

03:18.176 --> 03:20.266
Just got the call.

03:25.136 --> 03:26.412
You ride with McGee.

03:26.436 --> 03:28.566
These boots are new.

03:29.556 --> 03:31.072
Dead sailor in a box.

03:31.096 --> 03:33.062
Delivery manifest had no origin.

03:33.086 --> 03:36.162
We got to ask you this:
Did you order a dead body?

03:36.186 --> 03:37.542
No, we did not.

03:37.566 --> 03:38.552
Can you get him out of here now?

03:38.576 --> 03:40.662
This is a breach of security protocol.

03:40.686 --> 03:41.942
What is this place?

03:41.966 --> 03:43.082
That's classified.

03:43.106 --> 03:44.412
Classified?

03:44.436 --> 03:46.592
What do you got in there, aliens?

03:46.616 --> 03:48.522
Bigfoot? Ark of the Covenant?

03:48.546 --> 03:50.572
- That only leaves one thing.
- Unicorn.

03:50.596 --> 03:51.712
What is your clearance?

03:51.736 --> 03:52.882
About six-foot-one and half.

03:52.906 --> 03:54.346
Why, you got low ceilings?

03:55.106 --> 03:56.622
Just get him out of here now, would you?

03:56.646 --> 03:57.842
Can't. Protocol.

03:57.866 --> 04:00.262
Got to wait for the medical
examiner to release him.

04:00.286 --> 04:02.692
And there he is.

04:02.716 --> 04:03.892
How many trucks you guys got?

04:03.916 --> 04:06.872
Well, you've already met Widow
Woman and Spider Mike here.

04:06.896 --> 04:09.462
Rubber Ducky makes
it a great big convoy.

04:09.486 --> 04:11.092
Park it right there, Love Machine.

04:11.116 --> 04:12.942
We're gonna be rocking
through the night here, Smokey.

04:12.966 --> 04:15.072
DiNozzo, would rather not.

04:15.096 --> 04:17.041
Eastbound and down, Snowman.

04:17.065 --> 04:19.125
Bandit out.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.762
You see what I did
there? It was pretty good.

04:21.786 --> 04:23.942
Seamless transition from Convoy to...

04:23.966 --> 04:26.112
Yep, Smokey and the Bandit. I got it.

04:26.136 --> 04:27.742
You are a comic genius.

04:27.766 --> 04:29.696
Thanks.

04:33.186 --> 04:35.252
You got some structural damage there...

04:35.276 --> 04:36.272
Deckard.

04:36.296 --> 04:38.322
That's from Blade Runner.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.202
Dry ice.

04:39.226 --> 04:41.512
It's a very effective coolant.

04:41.536 --> 04:46.362
It was initially observed by a French chemist
in the first half of the 19th century.

04:46.386 --> 04:51.322
Meanwhile, half a world away, the
Chicago meat packer, Gustavus Swift,

04:51.346 --> 04:58.402
was trying to perfect a way of shipping edible
flesh in his refrigerated railroad cars.

04:58.426 --> 05:03.356
It was almost a century before
the two notions were put togeth...

05:03.546 --> 05:08.186
We do take the conveniences of the
modern era for granted, don't...

05:09.606 --> 05:10.762
Doctor?

05:10.786 --> 05:12.302
Something familiar, Duck?

05:12.326 --> 05:16.146
Reminds me of Gibraltar.

05:17.436 --> 05:20.766
Yeah, that... was the case.

05:21.646 --> 05:22.922
What happened in Gibraltar?

05:22.946 --> 05:25.462
That's a story for
another time, Mr. Palmer.

05:25.486 --> 05:27.582
Put the lid back on.
Let's get him in the van.

05:27.606 --> 05:31.106
There's nothing more for us to do here.

05:32.456 --> 05:35.056
Ready to go.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.866
- We up?
- Just about.

06:23.506 --> 06:25.102
Okay, I'm in their video feed.

06:25.126 --> 06:28.386
Recording live signal
for the feedback loop.

06:37.896 --> 06:40.686
Now we wait.

06:51.206 --> 06:52.262
You read me, Snowman?

06:52.286 --> 06:53.442
Sit tight, Bandit.

06:53.466 --> 06:58.382
Okay, electronic passcode:
Seven, five, three, zero, nine.

06:58.406 --> 07:01.542
Copy: Seven, five, three, zero, nine.

07:01.566 --> 07:02.902
Starting the loop now.

07:02.926 --> 07:04.262
Mirroring the cameras...

07:04.286 --> 07:05.912
the guards will be watching a re-feed.

07:05.936 --> 07:08.442
I'm sick of chasing after crazy women.

07:08.466 --> 07:10.232
It's like this girl's a robot.

07:10.256 --> 07:11.952
Guards have entered secondary hallway.

07:11.976 --> 07:13.632
Interior hallway clear.

07:13.656 --> 07:15.986
Green light.

07:28.226 --> 07:30.276
They're in.

07:35.886 --> 07:39.002
All right, there's a patrol coming
through; Take the first door on your right.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.036
15-second window. Go.

07:47.026 --> 07:49.456
Stop breathing.

07:55.496 --> 07:58.076
You are clear.

08:15.241 --> 08:16.582
- Is that a fire alarm?
- What did you do?

08:16.606 --> 08:17.592
What do you mean, me? You.

08:17.616 --> 08:19.392
Run. Run!

08:19.416 --> 08:21.726
Security alarm.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.292
Mr. Palmer, what did you do with...

08:34.316 --> 08:35.952
The cause of death paperwork.

08:35.976 --> 08:37.802
Sign here by the sticky flag.

08:37.826 --> 08:42.346
- And the body release...
- The body release form. Initial here.

08:42.836 --> 08:43.871
What time are the...

08:43.895 --> 08:47.376
The transportation to the mortician
is set up for tomorrow morning.

08:47.916 --> 08:53.926
As you're so adept at reading
my mind, what do I want now?

08:56.176 --> 08:58.242
Privacy.

08:58.266 --> 09:03.422
Spend enough time with someone, and
they begin to notice your patterns.

09:03.446 --> 09:05.412
Yeah, well, Palmer's
got your number, Duck.

09:05.436 --> 09:07.682
And I have yours.

09:07.706 --> 09:11.892
The successful conclusion of a case
usually marks the appearance of a...

09:11.916 --> 09:15.262
a sense of satisfaction
on your countenance.

09:15.286 --> 09:19.212
Presently, I can't help but
notice a lack of contentment.

09:19.236 --> 09:22.312
I didn't come down here
to get my head shrunk.

09:22.336 --> 09:24.302
What did you come for?

09:24.326 --> 09:26.282
Just killing time.

09:26.306 --> 09:30.206
Would you like me to perform
an autopsy on your watch?

09:31.966 --> 09:34.926
Yeah, Gibbs. On my way.

09:38.266 --> 09:40.812
There's obviously something on his mind.

09:40.836 --> 09:46.286
However, rest assured, whatever
it may be, it does not involve you.

09:47.416 --> 09:49.932
These are pretty standard indemnity
waivers. Should cover whatever...

09:49.956 --> 09:53.016
Gibbs. Pleasantries?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.022
Skip them.

09:56.046 --> 09:58.202
Got a mission for your team.
Something out of the ordinary.

09:58.226 --> 10:02.352
Secretary of the Navy sees the need to
upgrade our protection of strategic files.

10:02.376 --> 10:07.616
No wonder, after what happened with
Agent Langer trying to steal those...

10:07.936 --> 10:09.942
confidential military plans.

10:09.966 --> 10:12.612
SECNAV considers us lucky
they didn't get into the open.

10:12.636 --> 10:14.542
Thanks to Agent Lee.

10:14.566 --> 10:17.116
Thanks, Agent Lee.

10:17.736 --> 10:19.822
Doesn't want to press his luck anymore.

10:19.846 --> 10:22.172
You're looking at a new secure facility.

10:22.196 --> 10:23.662
Just how secure...

10:23.686 --> 10:26.502
- To be determined.
- By us.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.756
You get to be the bad guy for a change.

10:33.526 --> 10:35.782
Abby.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.512
Just a second.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.796
I'm, uh... I'm in the shower.

10:46.456 --> 10:48.362
I hit my face on your door.

10:48.386 --> 10:49.902
Why'd you do that?

10:49.926 --> 10:52.542
I don't know, 'cause the door's
locked. That door is never locked.

10:52.566 --> 10:54.752
The door's rarely been closed.

10:54.776 --> 10:58.386
There was a, uh... a draft.

10:59.456 --> 11:00.442
This room is sealed.

11:00.466 --> 11:01.452
Sealed.

11:01.476 --> 11:03.782
Sealed like an evidence box.

11:03.806 --> 11:05.362
Petty Officer Dent's personal effects.

11:05.386 --> 11:06.882
That's what you're here for.

11:06.906 --> 11:07.672
What are you working on?

11:07.696 --> 11:08.932
I'm not working on anything.

11:08.956 --> 11:10.462
Why would you think I
was working on something?

11:10.486 --> 11:12.942
I don't know. Uh, the
Dent case is closed.

11:12.966 --> 11:16.392
This is usually the time you catch your
breath and you seem decidedly out of it.

11:16.416 --> 11:19.366
Plus you've got something
on the monitor there.

11:20.496 --> 11:22.402
It has nothing to do with your case.

11:22.426 --> 11:23.522
It's another case.

11:23.546 --> 11:25.542
Whose case is it?

11:25.566 --> 11:28.866
It's my case. Okay? So get off it.

11:30.986 --> 11:33.206
Abby!

11:35.986 --> 11:37.892
- What's with the door?
- Don't ask.

11:37.916 --> 11:39.622
Gibbs wants us.

11:39.646 --> 11:42.336
What's that all about?

11:48.366 --> 11:50.986
Bye, guys. Nice to see you.

11:56.896 --> 11:58.242
This looks like a lecture.

11:58.266 --> 11:59.472
It's giving me college flashbacks.

11:59.496 --> 12:01.452
Doesn't this remind you of college?

12:01.476 --> 12:03.212
Not in the slightest.

12:03.236 --> 12:04.032
Hey, boss.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.572
McGee thinks we're
going to get a lecture.

12:05.596 --> 12:07.632
You just might if you
don't pay attention.

12:07.656 --> 12:09.612
Code name: Domino.

12:09.636 --> 12:10.612
Domino.

12:10.636 --> 12:14.722
Domino is the top secret
military contingency plan,

12:14.746 --> 12:18.426
which specifically details,

12:19.506 --> 12:21.952
Specifically details...

12:21.976 --> 12:24.272
Think the freshman's having
a senior moment, boss.

12:24.296 --> 12:29.466
How the US would respond to a terrorist attack on
a target of interest in Israel or the Middle East.

12:29.496 --> 12:31.242
What Langer hacked from our system.

12:31.266 --> 12:33.542
Gold star. McGee, study up.

12:33.566 --> 12:36.572
I'm up. I'm up, boss. I
just froze for a second.

12:36.596 --> 12:40.472
Electronic files like Domino need to
be accessible by multiple sources...

12:40.496 --> 12:43.122
President, Joint Chiefs...
Yet, they need to be secure.

12:43.146 --> 12:45.312
SECNAV wants to prevent another breach.

12:45.336 --> 12:47.472
Well, the only way to assure
that would be off-network.

12:47.496 --> 12:50.552
Stand-alone system hardwired directly
to the White House and the Pentagon.

12:50.576 --> 12:52.062
Like this one here.

12:52.086 --> 12:55.702
A labyrinth of security measures
surrounds the Central Access Hub...

12:55.726 --> 12:56.892
Housing Domino.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.002
Can't be hacked because
it's closed circuit.

12:59.026 --> 13:01.652
Which makes the file unstealable.

13:01.676 --> 13:05.646
Well, we're going to steal it.

13:06.296 --> 13:07.812
It's a test.

13:07.836 --> 13:09.082
Breach the facility.

13:09.106 --> 13:10.482
Enter the central hub.

13:10.506 --> 13:13.352
Retrieve Domino. Extract
without leaving a trace.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.922
Boss, it's an impossible mission.

13:14.946 --> 13:17.052
I suddenly see myself
dangling from wires.

13:17.076 --> 13:19.832
Our leak. Our responsibility.

13:19.856 --> 13:20.922
Use any resource.

13:20.946 --> 13:23.282
Don't let out specifics.
I want to hear a plan.

13:23.306 --> 13:26.482
Shall we play a game?

13:26.506 --> 13:27.932
Matthew Broderick in WarGames.

13:27.956 --> 13:30.372
Don't say the word "wargame."

13:30.396 --> 13:31.992
No one else knows?

13:32.016 --> 13:36.472
The guards manning this facility, they
don't even know there's a test coming.

13:36.496 --> 13:39.316
Okay, first thing we need...

13:39.966 --> 13:42.356
pizza.

13:50.476 --> 13:51.822
I say we go with a fire drill.

13:51.846 --> 13:53.242
Please stop pitching the fire drill.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.372
Oh, I think I got it.

13:55.396 --> 13:56.552
We are not digging a tunnel.

13:56.576 --> 13:57.672
Or building a catapult.

13:57.696 --> 13:59.752
Or setting up a series
of pneumatic tubes.

13:59.776 --> 14:01.072
Although I am partial to the concept.

14:01.096 --> 14:03.112
No, I haven't figured out a way in.

14:03.136 --> 14:06.646
I figured out we're thinking wrong.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.742
We need to think less like us.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.392
And more like them.

14:11.416 --> 14:12.232
Who are "them"?

14:12.256 --> 14:13.212
The guys we catch.

14:13.236 --> 14:16.482
The break-in specialists,
the burglars, the robbers.

14:16.506 --> 14:17.632
Remember that stakeout?

14:17.656 --> 14:20.042
The guy fooled you with the
mirror on the video surveillance.

14:20.066 --> 14:21.922
We put the cameras on
a loop. We can use that.

14:21.946 --> 14:23.792
- Can use that.
- Okay.

14:23.816 --> 14:25.692
Getting into an inaccessible building.

14:25.716 --> 14:27.392
How many bad guys have broken in here?

14:27.416 --> 14:32.652
The Trojan horseman hid inside a hollowed-out
seat of a taxicab to access the evidence garage.

14:32.676 --> 14:35.952
Nah, a taxi can't get into the front
gate of a high-security facility.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.652
Any other bad guys get in?

14:38.676 --> 14:39.642
Agent Lee.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.282
Is this up for grabs?

14:41.306 --> 14:44.332
If you can answer the question.

14:44.356 --> 14:49.576
Well, it was before my time,
but I'm guessing Ziva's brother?

14:50.196 --> 14:52.952
Half-brother. Ari.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.106
He infiltrated NCIS in a body bag.

14:55.146 --> 14:56.782
Ooh, we get a body in there.

14:56.806 --> 15:00.476
Gets the guards off guard,
but does it get us in the door?

15:00.976 --> 15:03.456
Follow-up question. Hypothetical.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.422
For the cheese.

15:05.446 --> 15:09.612
Say that a dead body was
discovered at a top secret facility.

15:09.636 --> 15:13.152
Okay, what kind of top secret facility?

15:13.176 --> 15:14.482
NORAD.

15:14.506 --> 15:16.152
Well, that's not our jurisdiction.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.292
The Navy equivalent.

15:17.316 --> 15:21.172
Yeah. Off the books.
Hush-hush, but Navy-operated.

15:21.196 --> 15:23.222
Can you be more specific?

15:23.246 --> 15:25.232
Say, a dead sailor.

15:25.256 --> 15:27.292
About the facility, not the body.

15:27.316 --> 15:29.892
That's all we got. Would they call us?

15:29.916 --> 15:32.112
Yeah, I can't see why they wouldn't.

15:32.136 --> 15:34.342
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

15:34.366 --> 15:35.852
- Small piece.
- Okay.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.932
Okay. Let's talk extraction.

15:37.956 --> 15:39.292
We need to be like a dentist.

15:39.316 --> 15:41.082
We got to kill the
nerve, take the tooth.

15:41.106 --> 15:41.952
How?

15:41.976 --> 15:43.062
Subterranean.

15:43.086 --> 15:44.032
The plumbing system.

15:44.056 --> 15:47.232
One-way valve joins up with the
main trunk under the street outside.

15:47.256 --> 15:49.582
They can't get in that
way, but they can get out.

15:49.606 --> 15:51.652
Thanks for volunteering
us for frogman duties.

15:51.676 --> 15:53.992
It's a slam dunk, boss.

15:54.016 --> 15:55.942
I'm sensing some reservations.

15:55.966 --> 15:56.582
Ducky.

15:56.606 --> 15:58.982
Yeah, we need to ask him
if we can borrow a body.

15:59.006 --> 15:59.602
Don't.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.922
It is the only way.

16:00.946 --> 16:03.512
Don't ask. Just take it.

16:03.536 --> 16:04.826
He'll say no.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.982
One other idea. Okay,
this is a good one.

16:07.006 --> 16:10.612
The emergency doors on corridor
two are tied to the fire alarm.

16:10.636 --> 16:14.642
Fire alarm goes off. Those doors open
automatically. For firefighter access.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.092
Practically open field to the hub.

16:16.116 --> 16:17.492
No. Too blatant.

16:17.516 --> 16:19.692
Navy is only concerned
about a covert breach.

16:19.716 --> 16:20.632
Get a body.

16:20.656 --> 16:21.932
Put it in motion.

16:21.956 --> 16:24.072
Oh, last thing.

16:24.096 --> 16:25.776
The other side's using live fire.

16:25.816 --> 16:28.712
Do not engage. Do not resist if caught.

16:28.736 --> 16:31.656
Get in. Get the intel. Get out.

16:32.096 --> 16:33.312
Nobody gets hurt.

16:33.336 --> 16:35.422
Present Time.

16:35.446 --> 16:36.482
They spotted us.

16:36.506 --> 16:39.472
- Something's wrong.
- Well, yeah. I can hear that, McGee.

16:39.496 --> 16:40.752
That's a fire alarm.

16:40.776 --> 16:43.576
Security alarm, too, which
shouldn't be going off.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.212
Our feed's been killed. We're blind.

16:49.236 --> 16:50.492
Game over.

16:50.516 --> 16:51.122
They haven't made us!

16:51.146 --> 16:52.432
- On the ground.
- Yet.

16:52.456 --> 16:54.966
Oh, no! No-no-no!

16:55.656 --> 16:57.876
Get down! Now!

16:59.416 --> 17:01.462
- Gunshot.
- Stand down.

17:01.486 --> 17:03.976
Stand down!

17:14.695 --> 17:16.806
Hold her!

17:43.496 --> 17:45.342
Young lady?

17:45.366 --> 17:47.652
Can you speak?

17:47.676 --> 17:49.062
Tony.

17:49.086 --> 17:50.142
Apologies for the shackles.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.956
We were concerned about
your state of mind.

17:52.016 --> 17:53.632
You were right to be.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.666
Where is Tony?

17:56.996 --> 17:59.086
Remain calm.

17:59.116 --> 18:03.546
I promise you and Agent
DiNozzo will soon be reunited.

18:08.196 --> 18:09.282
Cuban.

18:09.306 --> 18:11.502
Prohibited in the States.

18:11.526 --> 18:14.466
I trust you won't tell anyone.

18:16.236 --> 18:18.662
Director Vance has arrived, sir.

18:18.686 --> 18:20.956
She's awake.

18:28.966 --> 18:31.042
Tony.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.002
What is going on?

18:32.026 --> 18:34.636
I am not entirely sure.

18:36.236 --> 18:39.752
Deckard's bullets may not have been
real, but his gun butt sure was.

18:39.776 --> 18:43.016
If the bullets were not real, then...

18:46.116 --> 18:48.522
They knew we were coming.

18:48.546 --> 18:50.186
They were in on it, too?

18:50.216 --> 18:52.522
Oh, yeah, they were in on it.

18:52.546 --> 18:54.306
I don't know about "too."

18:54.336 --> 18:56.886
Apparently...

18:58.526 --> 19:00.842
we didn't get the full picture.

19:00.866 --> 19:02.622
Who was that man?

19:02.646 --> 19:05.206
- You don't recognize him?
- No.

19:05.516 --> 19:11.632
Well, there's this little drinking game sailors
taught me during my time as an agent afloat.

19:11.656 --> 19:13.272
Someone calls for a coin.

19:13.296 --> 19:14.952
You pull out one of these.

19:14.976 --> 19:17.492
Whoever has the highest officer's coin,

19:17.516 --> 19:22.272
whoever's rubbed elbows
with the biggest brass,

19:22.296 --> 19:24.542
everyone else has to buy him drinks.

19:24.566 --> 19:26.526
That's who that man was.

19:26.556 --> 19:31.392
The downside here is,
someone's lying to us.

19:31.416 --> 19:36.566
The upside is, we'll never
have to pay for a drink again.

19:38.556 --> 19:39.882
Mr. Secretary.

19:39.906 --> 19:42.672
Do you know where I was tonight, Leon?

19:42.696 --> 19:43.832
The Kennedy Center, sir.

19:43.856 --> 19:45.652
I checked with your
scheduling assistant.

19:45.676 --> 19:49.926
A visiting production of Chekhov's The
Cherry Orchard, a well-deserved distraction.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.592
Ignorance may have
been your best defense.

19:52.616 --> 19:57.392
A man of sound judgment might have opted to
schedule this affair for a less cluttered evening.

19:57.416 --> 20:00.212
I am sorry to pull you out of
it, sir; It was unavoidable.

20:00.236 --> 20:02.222
Oh, I love the Russians.

20:02.246 --> 20:05.426
Their cold, calculating approach
to this business of living

20:05.466 --> 20:08.712
makes me feel positively
sentimental by comparison.

20:08.736 --> 20:11.276
Do you have a light?

20:11.756 --> 20:14.596
Gibbs, isn't it?

20:15.686 --> 20:20.402
For all intents and purposes, sir, it should appear
to anyone watching that we were conducting a test.

20:20.426 --> 20:21.742
Security went off effectively.

20:21.766 --> 20:26.006
In a typical exercise of this nature, you
would've been called in to assess the situation.

20:26.046 --> 20:27.932
We had to delay our own
response time to correspond...

20:27.956 --> 20:30.242
Obviously, you've scripted
this little play, Leon.

20:30.266 --> 20:33.082
Just tell me where to go and how
much time I need to spend here.

20:33.106 --> 20:38.186
There's still the off chance I might rejoin the
Ambassador and our respective wives for a nightcap.

20:38.216 --> 20:38.932
Yes, sir.

20:38.956 --> 20:42.152
Have you determined whether this
elaborate ruse was worth the effort?

20:42.176 --> 20:44.942
We have confirmation.

20:44.966 --> 20:46.942
There's still a security breach in NCIS.

20:46.966 --> 20:50.372
My team did not set off the alarm.

20:50.396 --> 20:54.106
Someone got into the central hub.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.536
Really?

20:58.226 --> 20:59.962
Abby?

20:59.986 --> 21:01.352
Hey, your door's locked.

21:01.376 --> 21:04.096
I change one little thing,
and you all lose your minds.

21:04.126 --> 21:05.492
Is this because of the body snatchers?

21:05.516 --> 21:07.752
Are you accusing me
of being a pod person?

21:07.776 --> 21:09.052
No, I was talking about the theft.

21:09.076 --> 21:10.992
Abby, you haven't heard?

21:11.016 --> 21:13.302
Try beginning at the beginning,
Jimmy, instead of the middle.

21:13.326 --> 21:16.442
Okay, the sailor's body, Dent, I had
him all packed up and ready to go.

21:16.466 --> 21:18.916
I signed him over to Transpo
for delivery to the mortuary.

21:18.956 --> 21:21.272
And then... he got redirected.

21:21.296 --> 21:22.592
You lost a body?

21:22.616 --> 21:24.172
I didn't lose him, no.

21:24.196 --> 21:25.612
He was... stolen.

21:25.636 --> 21:27.832
And that's not even the weirdest part.

21:27.856 --> 21:30.662
We showed up at the crime
scene, and there he was.

21:30.686 --> 21:32.416
I think Gibbs had
something to do with it.

21:32.456 --> 21:34.622
And Dr. Mallard looks like
he wants to kill someone.

21:34.646 --> 21:35.812
I just don't want it to be me.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.372
So I am going...

21:37.396 --> 21:39.392
- You cannot hide here.
- Please!

21:39.416 --> 21:41.136
No!

21:45.206 --> 21:47.226
Hey, Abs.

21:47.526 --> 21:49.302
- You alone?
- Yeah.

21:49.326 --> 21:50.852
Gibbs sent me back.

21:50.876 --> 21:53.302
I thought you didn't have any work to
do. What are you doing here so late?

21:53.326 --> 21:56.042
What are you doing here so late?

21:56.066 --> 21:58.252
I guess I'm allowed
to talk about it now.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.766
We had a mission.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.392
It was a wargame.

22:01.416 --> 22:02.572
Oh, I understand.

22:02.596 --> 22:05.076
Yeah. We failed.

22:07.466 --> 22:10.512
Wait. Why do you understand?

22:10.536 --> 22:12.192
What do you mean? I'm understanding.

22:12.216 --> 22:14.132
I understand that you're
understanding, but...

22:14.156 --> 22:16.252
what are you understanding?

22:16.276 --> 22:18.902
How often do we go off on
secret wargame missions?

22:18.926 --> 22:19.592
Never.

22:19.616 --> 22:21.742
Yet you were not surprised
to hear that we were on one?

22:21.766 --> 22:23.512
Stop interrogating me, McGee.

22:23.536 --> 22:24.752
Stop acting weird.

22:24.776 --> 22:27.436
I am weird.

22:27.736 --> 22:29.252
Did you know where we were?

22:29.276 --> 22:30.612
I don't know anything.

22:30.636 --> 22:31.842
You know something.

22:31.866 --> 22:38.202
Well, now I guess I know everything,
but I didn't know anything then.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.352
- When?
- Before.

22:39.376 --> 22:41.052
- You're lying.
- I'm leaving.

22:41.076 --> 22:43.346
I'm staying.

22:46.756 --> 22:50.092
We're going to be let in on the
real mission now, assuming you know?

22:50.116 --> 22:51.756
It was a trap.

22:51.796 --> 22:53.832
There's a mole in NCIS.

22:53.856 --> 22:54.672
Another one?

22:54.696 --> 22:57.062
You mean Langer was not alone?

22:57.086 --> 22:58.722
Domino was the bait.

22:58.746 --> 23:00.212
This was an opportunity.

23:00.236 --> 23:01.652
To see if they would take it?

23:01.676 --> 23:02.822
Did they?

23:02.846 --> 23:05.732
Yeah, well, used our
break-in as a smokescreen.

23:05.756 --> 23:06.892
Interior cameras were disabled.

23:06.916 --> 23:09.962
Security was focused on us.

23:09.986 --> 23:11.442
We did half the work for 'em.

23:11.466 --> 23:13.782
The mole triggered the fire
alarm, used that access point?

23:13.806 --> 23:16.082
Mm-hmm, and the alarm in your sector...

23:16.106 --> 23:17.342
You were a diversion.

23:17.366 --> 23:20.302
So they could get to the
central hub undetected.

23:20.326 --> 23:25.706
They could not have gotten in and out in that amount
of time unless, of course, someone let them in.

23:31.876 --> 23:35.842
What exactly are we
looking for, Director Vance?

23:35.866 --> 23:39.346
I was under the impression that
if all went according to your plan,

23:39.376 --> 23:45.302
the intruder would enter this room, use this
station to access Domino, and still be here.

23:45.326 --> 23:49.742
I don't recall the part
about vanishing into thin air.

23:49.766 --> 23:53.346
The plan was never to apprehend
the intruder here, sir.

23:53.376 --> 23:55.132
No?

23:55.156 --> 23:56.572
Pardon my confusion.

23:56.596 --> 23:59.122
You do intend to catch this perpetrator?

23:59.146 --> 24:00.932
Of course, sir, but...

24:00.956 --> 24:04.176
Escort me out, Leon.

24:04.496 --> 24:08.636
Unless there are other nothings
you would like to show me.

24:10.456 --> 24:13.212
Don't touch the console.

24:13.236 --> 24:15.782
Doesn't seem like the kind of thing
that can wait. Where did McGee go anyway?

24:15.806 --> 24:17.232
- Leave it.
- But...

24:17.256 --> 24:20.422
It's bogus, DiNozzo.

24:20.446 --> 24:24.162
Whole installation is bogus.

24:24.186 --> 24:25.882
Nothing is real?

24:25.906 --> 24:28.626
Just the threat.

24:29.376 --> 24:32.712
Do you know who it is?

24:32.736 --> 24:35.982
Do we know who it is?

24:36.006 --> 24:38.442
Someone close to us.

24:38.466 --> 24:40.672
In my experience, when a
trap is properly sprung,

24:40.696 --> 24:43.602
usually one's quarry
is found locked inside.

24:43.626 --> 24:45.932
It's not sufficient to
identify the leak, sir.

24:45.956 --> 24:50.362
We need to determine the extent of the damage,
where it leads, where it's gone already.

24:50.386 --> 24:52.632
What we have now, sir, is just an ant,

24:52.656 --> 24:55.902
but the ant takes the poison to
the colony and the whole hill dies.

24:55.926 --> 24:59.812
What you have is not an ant, but a rat.

24:59.836 --> 25:03.312
Rats carry diseases;
Diseases you cannot cure.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.672
What you can do is catch the rat.

25:05.696 --> 25:08.102
The threat could be
more extensive than that.

25:08.126 --> 25:10.062
No one is above suspicion.

25:10.086 --> 25:14.022
When the vacancy was created
at the top of your agency,

25:14.046 --> 25:17.012
you induced me to give you this post.

25:17.036 --> 25:18.986
The deal was quite simple.

25:19.016 --> 25:22.836
Get your house in order.

25:26.316 --> 25:30.086
I do not care for vermin.

25:47.556 --> 25:49.552
Follow me.

25:49.576 --> 25:52.936
Okay, but only because I
was already going this way.

25:53.596 --> 25:54.582
What is with the...

25:54.606 --> 25:55.942
It's called discretion.

25:55.966 --> 25:57.012
What do you know?

25:57.036 --> 25:58.462
About what?

25:58.486 --> 26:02.362
You know Director Vance reassigned the three of
us because he believed there was a mole in NCIS.

26:02.386 --> 26:05.362
He'd narrowed it down to three
agents: Langer, Keating, and Lee.

26:05.386 --> 26:08.352
Langer was in possession of
Domino when Lee killed him.

26:08.376 --> 26:09.982
Thereby eliminating the mole problem.

26:10.006 --> 26:13.352
As far as Vance was concerned,
we were free to come home again.

26:13.376 --> 26:14.562
Right, so what's the problem?

26:14.586 --> 26:16.882
The problem is it's a load of crap.

26:16.906 --> 26:18.702
You're upset about losing the wargame.

26:18.726 --> 26:19.942
It wasn't a wargame.

26:19.966 --> 26:23.462
It was a mole hunt,
and it's not over yet.

26:23.486 --> 26:25.312
Langer was only part of it?

26:25.336 --> 26:29.142
Maybe... or maybe he was
not part of it at all.

26:29.166 --> 26:30.312
He was a patsy?

26:30.336 --> 26:32.212
Mole could have planted the info on him.

26:32.236 --> 26:35.952
Knew Vance was closing in,
killed Langer to get the heat off.

26:35.976 --> 26:38.622
How would he arrange
for Lee to shoot Langer?

26:38.646 --> 26:40.132
Easiest way.

26:40.156 --> 26:43.022
The mole... is... benign,

26:43.046 --> 26:47.342
which is fantastic 'cause I was a little
worried, and so the dermatologist says,

26:47.366 --> 26:50.252
"That's not a carcinoma, all
right. It's a beauty mark."

26:50.276 --> 26:51.522
Hey, how are you, Michelle?

26:51.546 --> 26:55.092
Hey, I'm sorry. I overheard.
I'm, I'm glad it's good news.

26:55.116 --> 26:58.196
Oh, yeah, beauty mark.

26:59.416 --> 27:01.862
So, um, how did that
other situation work out?

27:01.886 --> 27:04.472
You know, the hypothetical one.

27:04.496 --> 27:06.892
Good, good. Thank you for your help.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.842
Oh, don't mention it.

27:08.866 --> 27:13.012
Not that you guys mentioned
much. You were... secretive.

27:13.036 --> 27:16.142
We were, um, conducting an exercise.

27:16.166 --> 27:17.172
It's a wargame.

27:17.196 --> 27:19.256
Oh, cool. Who won?

27:21.176 --> 27:23.676
The other side.

27:28.476 --> 27:30.512
How's your team taking
it... being left in the dark?

27:30.536 --> 27:32.332
Like pros.

27:32.356 --> 27:35.692
They know the danger if
she suspects we're onto her.

27:35.716 --> 27:39.132
Well, it's best for them to
lick their wounds and act beaten.

27:39.156 --> 27:41.292
Long as you know it's just an act.

27:41.316 --> 27:42.732
It won't last much longer.

27:42.756 --> 27:46.166
No, but in the meantime,
they have to stay bottled up.

27:46.466 --> 27:49.132
Lee gets spooked, this
whole thing's blown.

27:49.156 --> 27:51.262
And we'll never know if
she's working with someone.

27:51.286 --> 27:54.512
I've burned a lot of satellite
hours monitoring her movements.

27:54.536 --> 27:57.632
She hasn't made a contact yet.

27:57.656 --> 27:59.742
Stone face, not much consolation.

27:59.766 --> 28:00.902
She's a trained agent, Leon.

28:00.926 --> 28:03.072
You can't put a tail on her every
time she leaves the building.

28:03.096 --> 28:05.792
I'm tempted to bust her right
now before anything goes wrong.

28:05.816 --> 28:08.692
Little powwow with SECNAV bring
on a change of heart, Leon?

28:08.716 --> 28:09.962
Change of mind perhaps.

28:09.986 --> 28:12.162
Stick with the plan.

28:12.186 --> 28:14.142
You looking to sit in this chair, Gibbs?

28:14.166 --> 28:16.532
Well, that would be a little
awkward. Chair's occupied.

28:16.556 --> 28:19.672
Means, unfortunately, I
don't take my orders from you.

28:19.696 --> 28:21.942
Might be easier...

28:21.966 --> 28:25.306
but then I wouldn't have all this.

28:35.166 --> 28:36.826
Oof, that one hurt.

28:36.856 --> 28:38.252
No, it didn't.

28:38.276 --> 28:43.546
Didn't we get our fill of secret agendas and lying
and manipulation during the previous administration?

28:43.576 --> 28:45.896
Look, I, too, had hoped things
would be different by now.

28:45.926 --> 28:47.802
I'd like to go and give
Vance a piece of my mind.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.032
The way you're losing it, I don't
thin you have enough to spare.

28:50.056 --> 28:53.296
I'd like to take that toothpick of
his and shove it up the SECNAV's cigar.

28:53.686 --> 28:55.242
You have had enough of this job, then.

28:55.266 --> 28:56.172
I like the job.

28:56.196 --> 28:57.422
I don't like the politics.

28:57.446 --> 28:59.002
I wasn't kidding about
that part earlier.

28:59.026 --> 29:01.392
If you had ever had
some military training,

29:01.416 --> 29:03.442
then maybe you would have
learned to follow orders.

29:03.466 --> 29:04.882
What, like you?

29:04.906 --> 29:07.236
We were given a direct
order not to engage.

29:07.266 --> 29:09.762
I recall that you were the
first one to throw a punch.

29:09.786 --> 29:10.912
It was a reflex.

29:10.936 --> 29:13.342
Hmm, really? Then what happened after?

29:13.366 --> 29:17.372
Last thing I remember before the lights went out
was you kimbo-slicing through a room full of guards.

29:17.396 --> 29:18.252
Was that a reflex?

29:18.276 --> 29:19.832
Yes, it was.

29:19.856 --> 29:22.686
Gunshot went off. I saw you...

29:26.606 --> 29:29.192
I'm tired of pretending.

29:29.216 --> 29:31.472
So am I.

29:31.496 --> 29:34.282
It's dinner theater
for an audience of one.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.986
When's the curtain go down?

29:40.796 --> 29:43.702
Violated is the least
of what I'm feeling.

29:43.726 --> 29:49.262
I-If ever there was a time for you to break your
moratorium on apologies, then this would be it.

29:49.286 --> 29:53.242
I am not unfamiliar with the
discourtesies of the spy game,

29:53.266 --> 29:56.182
but there are certain liberties
you do not take, and if you do,

29:56.206 --> 29:58.302
you have to tell the other
person as soon as you can.

29:58.326 --> 29:59.972
I'm sorry, Ducky.

29:59.996 --> 30:02.022
Thank you for that apology, Anthony.

30:02.046 --> 30:03.682
I'm sorry I didn't let you
in on what we were doing.

30:03.706 --> 30:06.632
I knew it'd piss you off, but, uh...

30:06.656 --> 30:08.832
I guess I didn't trust
you enough. Sorry.

30:08.856 --> 30:10.762
Thank you, Anthony. That will do.

30:10.786 --> 30:14.972
And I'm sorry for making you look like an
idiot in front of the Secretary of the Navy.

30:14.996 --> 30:18.092
I'm sorry for being a
cowardly, devious son of a...

30:18.116 --> 30:21.006
- Anthony!
- Are you done?

30:21.366 --> 30:22.402
Excuse me.

30:22.426 --> 30:25.402
I'm not comfortable with
the hand up my backside.

30:25.426 --> 30:29.422
You let the Toothpick use us as puppets.

30:29.446 --> 30:30.702
No, I didn't.

30:30.726 --> 30:32.862
- You didn't?
- No.

30:32.886 --> 30:35.322
It was my plan.

30:35.346 --> 30:36.382
Your plan?

30:36.406 --> 30:38.766
Every bit of it.

30:42.296 --> 30:43.582
That's much worse.

30:43.606 --> 30:45.192
It wasn't that I don't trust you.

30:45.216 --> 30:48.396
I didn't let you in
because I didn't have to.

30:49.216 --> 30:52.652
I don't make the right
play, she could kill again.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.522
So it is Lee.

30:54.546 --> 30:55.542
I'm not worried about her.

30:55.566 --> 30:57.592
She's caught, but she
doesn't know it yet.

30:57.616 --> 30:58.832
Well, then, why don't we just grab her?

30:58.856 --> 31:00.192
What are you worried about?

31:00.216 --> 31:02.052
Who else is connected.

31:02.076 --> 31:03.562
- In this building?
- Maybe.

31:03.586 --> 31:04.662
Well, how are you gonna find out?

31:04.686 --> 31:07.262
All the cameras in the
Grand Wazoo room went down.

31:07.286 --> 31:11.202
The keyboard in the central hub
is coated with an invisible dye.

31:11.226 --> 31:11.882
Ducky.

31:11.906 --> 31:13.842
What, are you going to
continue to muzzle me?

31:13.866 --> 31:19.012
It contains a radioactive isotope whose unique
signature can be picked up by a Geiger counter.

31:19.036 --> 31:22.312
Well, whoever accessed the
console probably wore gloves, so...

31:22.336 --> 31:24.142
No, it would penetrate.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.992
Stays on your hands for days.

31:26.016 --> 31:28.072
If Lee has an accomplice, we'll know.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.912
And if she doesn't? What
if you come up empty?

31:30.936 --> 31:33.152
Pray we do.

31:33.176 --> 31:37.016
I used both of you because
I knew you could handle it.

31:37.426 --> 31:40.902
What do you need from us now?

31:40.926 --> 31:42.946
Patience.

31:44.906 --> 31:47.022
Abby, will you open up?

31:47.046 --> 31:49.032
I'm not interested. Thank you.

31:49.056 --> 31:51.162
Abby, I need to tell you something.

31:51.186 --> 31:53.302
I don't really care for your tone.

31:53.326 --> 31:54.802
I need to tell you something.

31:54.826 --> 31:58.042
No, I still don't really care for it.

31:58.066 --> 32:01.626
Abby, what has gotten
into you? Come on. Open up.

32:11.736 --> 32:12.762
Yes, Director.

32:12.786 --> 32:14.132
Get me Security.

32:14.156 --> 32:15.292
Anyone in particular?

32:15.316 --> 32:17.236
All of them.

32:18.316 --> 32:22.056
Geez, McGee. Are you
trying to break it down?

32:39.366 --> 32:42.646
Everyone stay together.
Bring in the next group.

32:48.006 --> 32:50.242
No one speak.

32:50.266 --> 32:54.042
If there's any confusion why you're
in here, it will soon become clear.

32:54.066 --> 32:57.306
Several of you were involved in
a covert operation last night.

32:57.336 --> 32:59.722
The rest of you, whether
you were aware or not,

32:59.746 --> 33:02.396
were in close enough proximity
to have knowledge of some,

33:02.426 --> 33:04.872
if not all, of the details.

33:04.896 --> 33:10.592
The operation was designed to identify
a security leak in our department.

33:10.616 --> 33:14.162
One of you accessed a console onsite.

33:14.186 --> 33:16.012
This will tell me who.

33:16.036 --> 33:19.756
Until this matter is resolved,
nobody is to leave the building.

33:20.306 --> 33:23.756
There's a traitor in this room.

33:26.246 --> 33:28.986
Show me your hands.

34:02.026 --> 34:05.396
Show me your hands.

34:12.708 --> 34:15.996
- Take Ms. Sciuto into custody.
- Yes, sir.

34:38.126 --> 34:40.782
All right, I've only got a minute.

34:40.806 --> 34:45.152
Gibbs is up with the director right now trying to figure
out which one of them is going to interrogate you.

34:45.176 --> 34:49.036
Abby, you have got to
tell me. What is going on?

34:49.315 --> 34:51.732
Is that some kind of trick?

34:51.755 --> 34:52.672
What do you mean?

34:52.696 --> 34:54.672
Bad cop, dumb cop routine.

34:54.696 --> 34:56.752
See who can get me to talk.

34:56.775 --> 34:58.052
I'm not talking.

34:58.076 --> 35:00.772
- You are talking.
- Right.

35:00.796 --> 35:04.152
Okay, I'm not talking starting now.

35:04.176 --> 35:06.432
Abby, this is absurd.
You are not a traitor.

35:06.456 --> 35:09.546
Why would you be? You love this country.

35:10.396 --> 35:12.586
You love NCIS.

35:12.616 --> 35:13.382
You love your lab.

35:13.406 --> 35:16.372
You would never risk losing your lab.

35:16.396 --> 35:20.176
Abby, you would never betray Gibbs.

35:22.486 --> 35:24.032
Special Agent McGee.

35:24.056 --> 35:25.522
What are you doing with my suspect?

35:25.546 --> 35:27.122
Nothing, Director.

35:27.146 --> 35:28.662
She's not talking anyway.

35:28.686 --> 35:29.522
I want a lawyer.

35:29.546 --> 35:32.176
Sit tight, Ms. Sciuto.

35:53.906 --> 35:57.746
Agent Lee, I've been looking for you.

35:58.036 --> 35:59.152
Director Vance.

35:59.176 --> 36:00.522
Uh, what do you need, sir?

36:00.546 --> 36:02.882
Sciuto is entitled to
legal representation.

36:02.906 --> 36:04.592
Now this is sensitive.

36:04.616 --> 36:08.212
Of course, sir. I'll see that
someone is assigned immediately.

36:08.236 --> 36:10.562
What specifically are the charges?

36:10.586 --> 36:13.386
Conspiracy to murder, treason, sedition.

36:13.416 --> 36:16.382
We're talking about the kind of crimes
that federal agencies are brought down by.

36:16.406 --> 36:19.202
I don't want her name equated with this
agency like Hanssen is with the FBI.

36:19.226 --> 36:21.932
- Do you read me?
- Yes, sir. No headlines.

36:21.956 --> 36:24.262
Find me a criminal defense
lawyer who understands that.

36:24.286 --> 36:26.136
Okay.

36:26.866 --> 36:28.622
Sir?

36:28.646 --> 36:32.162
That's the type of conversation
I'd have to have person-to-person.

36:32.186 --> 36:33.672
Not over the phone.

36:33.696 --> 36:35.192
I'd have to leave the building.

36:35.216 --> 36:37.022
And we're still on lockdown.

36:37.046 --> 36:39.826
Fine. I'll alert Security.

36:41.196 --> 36:42.132
And Lee?

36:42.156 --> 36:43.232
Yes, sir?

36:43.256 --> 36:45.356
Do it now.

36:52.006 --> 36:53.612
Okay, here's what I know.

36:53.636 --> 36:55.792
You've been working on something.

36:55.816 --> 36:58.002
It's not related to an official case.

36:58.026 --> 37:00.312
You've been secretive, sneaky.

37:00.336 --> 37:03.786
You've been locking your
doors, hiding from people.

37:05.016 --> 37:10.652
Now, that all looks bad, but, Abby,
I know that you're a good person.

37:10.676 --> 37:13.692
You're occasionally eccentric,
but you're always reliable.

37:13.716 --> 37:15.312
You're trustworthy.

37:15.336 --> 37:16.842
I know you don't want to talk...

37:16.866 --> 37:19.032
Of course I want to talk, McGee.

37:19.056 --> 37:20.382
I'm dying here.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.072
I've been in on this
since the beginning!

37:22.096 --> 37:23.822
Not-Not the traitor part.

37:23.846 --> 37:27.386
The catching of the traitor part.

37:28.936 --> 37:31.142
Gibbs came to me days ago.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.112
I formulated the marking dye.

37:33.136 --> 37:36.512
I couldn't let anyone into the lab
because no one could see what I was doing.

37:36.536 --> 37:38.642
And plus, I spilled some.

37:38.666 --> 37:39.662
On your hands?

37:39.686 --> 37:40.442
And on the floor.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.942
I mean, the hands part...
That was part of the plan.

37:42.966 --> 37:44.622
Wait. So, this is all part of it?

37:44.646 --> 37:46.582
Gibbs and Vance know
that you're innocent?

37:46.606 --> 37:47.652
As a puppy.

37:47.676 --> 37:50.952
I mean, the kind of puppy that
you would send into the bushes

37:50.976 --> 37:54.172
to make all the birds fly
out so you could shoot them.

37:54.196 --> 38:00.596
You're so sweet to worry, Timmy,
but I'm not in the crosshairs.

38:27.616 --> 38:29.496
Go.

38:58.686 --> 39:01.662
Who is that for?

39:01.686 --> 39:02.722
It was a signal.

39:02.746 --> 39:05.196
We turned the heat on, opened the door.

39:05.226 --> 39:07.402
If it was just you, you would run.

39:07.426 --> 39:10.072
You do this, means it's a conspiracy.

39:10.096 --> 39:11.492
X leads us to your handler.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.926
We're used to the idea of
people working as a team.

39:16.456 --> 39:19.096
Act naturally.

39:33.926 --> 39:36.946
- Gibbs! I can explain.
- Sit down.

39:38.036 --> 39:40.292
This is a formality.

39:40.316 --> 39:41.812
You are alone here.

39:41.836 --> 39:44.222
You did it to yourself.

39:44.246 --> 39:45.862
Langer.

39:45.886 --> 39:46.852
What about Langer?

39:46.876 --> 39:48.772
Langer!

39:48.796 --> 39:49.752
He wasn't part of it.

39:49.776 --> 39:51.352
NCIS.

39:51.376 --> 39:53.032
No one I know of.

39:53.056 --> 39:54.986
Why?

39:55.396 --> 39:57.176
Because I had no choice.

39:57.206 --> 40:00.472
- Believe me, I had no choice in this.
- Not true.

40:00.496 --> 40:03.432
- If I don't do what they want, you...
- Who?

40:03.456 --> 40:04.222
Oh, God.

40:04.246 --> 40:05.392
Who are they?

40:05.416 --> 40:07.532
I don't know!

40:07.556 --> 40:08.992
But they know me!

40:09.016 --> 40:10.272
And they knew how to get to me.

40:10.296 --> 40:13.266
They knew things about
me you don't know.

40:20.536 --> 40:22.706
Look.

40:23.116 --> 40:25.646
This is Amanda.

40:26.486 --> 40:28.352
She's my daughter.

40:28.376 --> 40:32.852
If I don't deliver what they
want, they will kill her.

40:32.876 --> 40:35.882
If I tell anybody, they will kill her.

40:35.906 --> 40:39.632
If I do anything that
they don't like, they...

40:39.656 --> 40:43.396
If they knew I was in
here right now, she's dead.

40:43.696 --> 40:46.756
What am I supposed to do?

40:49.936 --> 40:52.102
Daughter kidnapped and held hostage.

40:52.126 --> 40:55.932
Almost seems designed to engender
sympathy specifically from you.

40:55.956 --> 40:57.922
It doesn't mean it's not true.

40:57.946 --> 41:01.336
Are you trying to
convince me or yourself?

41:01.866 --> 41:04.182
Daughter doesn't exist
in the personnel file.

41:04.206 --> 41:06.052
We have record of a much younger sister.

41:06.076 --> 41:07.872
She claims Amanda's her daughter.

41:07.896 --> 41:09.372
Had her when she was in high school.

41:09.396 --> 41:11.612
Parents raised her as a sibling.

41:11.636 --> 41:12.972
Lee was focused.

41:12.996 --> 41:14.642
College, law school.

41:14.666 --> 41:16.952
She is ambitious.

41:16.976 --> 41:20.556
We formally charge her, your
little girl's gone forever.

41:21.316 --> 41:24.522
Or the story's a lie, and
Lee's still playing us.

41:24.546 --> 41:27.906
She's had everybody
fooled from the beginning.

41:28.866 --> 41:32.162
Almost everybody.

41:32.186 --> 41:35.256
What do you want to do?

41:38.976 --> 41:41.282
Guys, I have kind of a confession.

41:41.306 --> 41:45.462
Michelle and I sort of
had a-a clandestine...

41:45.486 --> 41:47.502
We kind of dated for a while.

41:47.526 --> 41:49.112
We know.

41:49.136 --> 41:49.882
You do?

41:49.906 --> 41:52.972
Jimmy, I'm sorry your girlfriend
turned out to be a Cylon.

41:52.996 --> 41:55.802
She has a kid. I mean, I didn't
know that. Did you know that?

41:55.826 --> 41:57.472
I didn't know that.

41:57.496 --> 41:58.872
Wonder what they're doing up there.

41:58.896 --> 42:00.852
Does the Navy still hang people?

42:00.876 --> 42:02.772
- Tony!
- Well, it is treason, Abby.

42:02.796 --> 42:03.722
McGee!

42:03.746 --> 42:04.862
What else can they do?

42:04.886 --> 42:06.992
There's no way she walks out of here.

42:07.016 --> 42:09.456
No way.

42:18.586 --> 42:21.376
Good night, everyone.

43:01.236 --> 43:03.896
Looks like we're working together.
