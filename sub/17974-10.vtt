(chuckles)

00:33.633 --> 00:35.034
(low conversations)

00:39.005 --> 00:41.206
All right, listen up.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.009
I told Freight Train to be home
promptly at 6:30

00:44.011 --> 00:47.379
for a special dinner, so it's
time for everybody to hide.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.148
Donna, you're the biggest,
so you might want to push

00:49.150 --> 00:51.016
the couch and the
piano together.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.551
Come on, big'un.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.889
Not yet. Not yet.

00:58.858 --> 01:00.392
Not yet. Not yet.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.363
And... finished.

01:04.365 --> 01:08.400
I call it,
"He Ain't Coming, Mom."

01:11.037 --> 01:13.005
We goin'?

01:13.007 --> 01:16.875
I'm sorry Dad stood you
up on your anniversary.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.377
Please, if I had to be reminded

01:18.379 --> 01:20.846
that I married her
b'tugly-ass every year,

01:20.848 --> 01:22.347
I'd stand her up, too.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.183
Let's go.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.517
WOMAN:
Bye, Lavar.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.419
(vehicle driving away)
Bye, Diane Lane.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.557
Uh, I renamed my car Diane Lane.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.026
Ooh, I'm naming
mine Carol.

01:34.028 --> 01:35.027
Happy Anniv....

01:35.029 --> 01:38.030
Ow! My breathing nose.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.565
What are you all doing
in my house?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.600
This was our surprise
anniversary party, Lavar,

01:41.602 --> 01:44.570
and you were supposed
to be here hours ago.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.738
(sobbing)
Now you know how I felt

01:46.740 --> 01:49.074
when you were late
and we got stuck with Cleveland.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.542
That's me!

01:50.544 --> 01:51.877
Wait.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.179
(sobbing)

01:56.416 --> 01:58.117
Aw, this ain't Toys"R"Us.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.218
You're a liar, Mama.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.419
I'll only be a minute.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.888
Gotta grab me a big thing
of pretzels.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.224
A minute?
That never means a minute.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.059
What are we gonna do?

02:07.061 --> 02:10.062
This place is so <i>booooring.</i>

02:10.064 --> 02:12.464
What?
This place is amazing.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.066
What are you
doing, man?

02:14.068 --> 02:16.468
I hang out here all the time,
playing office.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.903
(yawns)

02:17.905 --> 02:19.238
Work.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.472
You want to play?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.907
Can I be the co-worker

02:21.909 --> 02:23.108
who's secretly sleeping
with the receptionist

02:23.110 --> 02:26.078
and no one knows
but everyone knows?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.112
Cheryl?

02:27.114 --> 02:29.148
She's got HPV.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.817
So? All right, I'm gonna
go find the marker aisle,

02:31.819 --> 02:33.252
get a couple good whiffs,

02:33.254 --> 02:36.588
and then go stare at
some screen savers.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.491
I'm sorry, Junior,
but this unit has been sold.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.593
What? But I've been
playing office here

02:41.595 --> 02:43.495
for a year and a half.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.964
I know. And nothing has brought
a smile to my face

02:45.966 --> 02:48.267
more than seeing you grow
Cleveland Jr. Industries

02:48.269 --> 02:50.135
from a fake mom-and-pop
organization

02:50.137 --> 02:52.337
to a fake international
conglomerate.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.140
But I'm afraid floor models
don't last forever.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.142
Can you give me a
moment to say good-bye?

02:57.144 --> 02:59.278
Take all the time
you need.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.280
It's going
in two minutes.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.782
I envy you,
my particleboard friend.

03:03.784 --> 03:07.286
You're going to see what
it's like in a real office.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.622
(sighs)
That's always been my dream.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.624
Someday.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.093
Or maybe today.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.299
(grunting)

03:20.301 --> 03:21.967
This double-wide,
horizontal filing cabinet

03:21.969 --> 03:23.168
needs to go, too.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.703
Phew.

03:25.972 --> 03:27.472
Let's go, Rallo.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.641
Have you seen Roberta?
No.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.311
But I've seen everything else.

03:32.313 --> 03:36.181
(shuttering gibberish)

03:36.183 --> 03:38.884
(traffic sounds)

03:48.161 --> 03:51.330
It's even more beautiful
than in my dreams.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.332
Mornin'.
Traffic, huh?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.400
(chuckles)
Tell me about it.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.702
Frank Lefkowitz.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.237
Just transferred
from Sarasota.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.672
Well, welcome to the
Stoolbend branch.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.207
Sarasota, huh?

04:02.209 --> 04:04.843
Long shot, but do you know
Steve Mazepa?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.178
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.847
He's the guy, about three foot
tall, huge calves,

04:08.849 --> 04:11.350
lives in a tree,
hands covered in fur, right?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.352
Head looks like an anvil?

04:13.354 --> 04:15.020
Uh, maybe.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.521
I actually knew his brother
a little better.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.257
Well, better get
back to work.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.363
I'm doing it.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.265
I'm really doing it.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.535
I just saw Mom
at the beauty parlor.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.038
She's crying
under a dryer.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.373
What were you
doing there?

04:34.375 --> 04:36.375
I was also crying
under a dryer.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.911
Oh, I can't stand
to see Mother sad.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.547
So, when it comes to patching
things up between you and Mom,

04:42.549 --> 04:46.051
I think I've got just
the metaphorical ticket.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.419
Literal tickets.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.955
George Clinton and
the P-Funk All Stars?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.390
That's Mom's
favorite band.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.258
They're for
your anniversary.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.062
The perfect mermento to
cammermurate the occasion.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.431
Cool. Who should I take?
Mom!

04:59.433 --> 05:01.066
My mom's dead, Cleveland.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.401
My mom.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.935
I bought these so you could
make it up to her

05:03.937 --> 05:06.271
for missing
your guys's anniversary.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.407
Let her know you don't
take her for granted.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.143
Just tell her that
this was your idea.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.612
I do like lying
to your mother.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.181
(funk music playing)

05:18.484 --> 05:20.919
Oh, man. Great.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.287
McTubby and Wife.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.755
Thanks for the
tickets, Cleveland.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.590
You're welc--
Uh, they're from Dad.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.592
Oh, please.
Cleveland, I know

05:27.594 --> 05:29.761
you've been covering for
your father for years.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.296
The cards, the flowers,

05:31.298 --> 05:32.931
that time you
dressed up like him

05:32.933 --> 05:34.666
and took me to Paris
for my birthday.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.134
♪
(slurping)

05:36.136 --> 05:37.269
Oh, Lavar.

05:37.271 --> 05:38.837
This is so romantic.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.673
Shut up, Mommy.
I mean, bitch.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.343
(funk music playing,
fireworks popping)

05:50.950 --> 05:53.151
(whoops)
George Clinton!

05:53.153 --> 05:55.287
(whoops)

05:55.289 --> 05:57.789
Where's all my ladies
at tonight?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.291
(whooping)
Right here, baby.

05:59.293 --> 06:01.126
There are also men
in the crowd!

06:01.128 --> 06:03.295
Involve us!

06:03.297 --> 06:05.364
Which one of y'all ready to funk
with me tonight?

06:05.366 --> 06:07.632
(crowd cheering)

06:07.634 --> 06:09.801
Oh, my God, George Clinton!

06:09.803 --> 06:11.470
Cleveland, you
come, too.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.539
No, he wants you.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.475
What's your name?

06:16.477 --> 06:19.211
Evelyn, but my friends
call me Cookie.

06:19.213 --> 06:22.180
Well, why don't I just call
you Cosmic Chocolate?

06:22.182 --> 06:23.415
Mmm!

06:24.650 --> 06:25.851
Mmm!

06:25.853 --> 06:28.487
(giggles)

06:28.489 --> 06:30.655
Cookie, sit down,
you're gonna break the stage.

06:30.657 --> 06:31.823
Hah! Jealous?

06:31.825 --> 06:33.225
Hell no.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.326
I am.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.328
When is the men's turn?

06:36.330 --> 06:38.330
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.399
Why don't we just let
the mother ship sail

06:40.401 --> 06:43.001
right on into
your Milky Way, baby?

06:43.003 --> 06:45.904
That's my mom!
That's my mom!

06:47.407 --> 06:49.341
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.076
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.444
(crowd cheering)

06:56.349 --> 06:57.582
Is your mom funkin'
George Clinton?

06:57.584 --> 07:00.519
Making a damn fool of
herself is what she's doing.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.853
Let's hear it for
Evelyn, y'all,

07:01.855 --> 07:04.756
my beautiful Bride
of Funkenstein.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.024
Yeah.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.193
(Cookie giggling,
crowd cheering)

07:08.195 --> 07:10.395
(fireworks popping)

07:10.397 --> 07:13.031
(crickets chirping)

07:13.033 --> 07:14.366
It's been an hour
and a half.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.367
When's she coming
back out?

07:15.369 --> 07:17.102
Don't worry about Mom.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.870
She's probably just having
some cheese plates.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.374
P-Funk's probably got all kinds
of cheeses-eses back there.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.376
Well, I'm sick
of waiting.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.645
Let's tell her
it's time to go.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.882
Cleveland,
put your underpants back on.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.551
No!

07:32.553 --> 07:33.618
(loud pounding)

07:33.620 --> 07:34.920
Yeah?

07:34.922 --> 07:35.954
My wife's in there.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.556
Tell her I'm ready to go.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.392
Is she a thick, squat
older version of him?

07:40.394 --> 07:42.727
That's very kind
of you. Yes.

07:42.729 --> 07:43.895
She with them.

07:43.897 --> 07:44.963
COOKIE:
Bow, wow, wow,

07:44.965 --> 07:46.898
yippee-yo, yippee-yay!

07:46.900 --> 07:48.133
My God.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.968
Cleveland, do you know
what this means?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.237
I think we all know
what this means.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.806
George Clinton
has kidnapped your mother.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.475
(laughs)
No.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.914
So, let me get this straight,
Mr. Brown.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.416
You're saying that your wife--

08:04.418 --> 08:06.585
a thick, squat
older version of him...

08:06.587 --> 08:08.086
Very kind,
thank you.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.988
...was kidnapped
by Dr. Funkenstein himself,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.957
George Clinton?

08:11.959 --> 08:12.958
I don't like
what you're implying.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.093
Why would any woman
run off with anybody

08:15.095 --> 08:17.295
when she's got a man at home?

08:17.297 --> 08:18.997
Uh, you're not all that?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.298
Come on, Cleveland.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.934
Once again, the police are
no help to a black man.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.803
We are both black, sir.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.271
All cops are white
on the inside.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.139
Like a Eskimo Bar.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.674
Or a coconut.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.779
These charts behind me
don't lie, people.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.515
Our numbers are down
across the board.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.949
According to this chart,

08:37.951 --> 08:40.285
the only department
that's pulling its weight

08:40.287 --> 08:42.120
is the Charts Department.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.588
Nice job, Charts.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.691
How do we boost our numbers?

08:46.693 --> 08:47.959
Myron.
Uh, well...

08:47.961 --> 08:49.294
Terrible.
Why do I bother?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.962
Next.
Uh...

08:50.964 --> 08:52.998
Tried it in '09.
Doesn't work.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.065
You, new guy.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.002
Well, Mr. Oxnard, sir,

08:57.004 --> 08:59.004
I think we should look
at the toys

08:59.006 --> 09:02.140
and make sure they're the ones
that the kids want to play with.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.175
Toys? What toys?
We don't make toys.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.979
No, sir, I think what Lefkowitz
is saying is a metaphor.

09:07.981 --> 09:11.016
We need to put the fun back into
facultative reinsurance

09:11.018 --> 09:12.484
and cooperative underwriting.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.486
And with each policy
we give away a toy.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.054
A rubber bus
or something.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.656
Or dolls.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.991
Yeah, or a rubber bus.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.326
Good job, Lefkowitz.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.995

parking spot.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.664
♪ Frank Lefkowitz

09:25.666 --> 09:27.666

tour schedule.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.011
They're in Knoxville
tomorrow night.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.013
If we leave right now,
we can catch up to 'em.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.748
Dad, I think
Mom is okay.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.216
We don't know that.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.686
COOKIE:
Oh, I'm more than okay,
I'm alive.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.920
Evelyn.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.889
Hey, Freight Train.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.357
How are you?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.559
I've never been better.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.529
You like the dress
George bought me?

09:57.531 --> 09:59.197
Evelyn, your mammarys
are hanging out.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.565
What the hell are you doing?

10:00.567 --> 10:02.534
Being appreciated, Lavar.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.736
George Clinton listens to me,

10:04.738 --> 10:07.272
and he likes my cooking.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.074
Gotta go.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.376
Hey, baby, you ready
for round 20?

10:11.378 --> 10:12.811
(lascivious chuckle)

10:13.946 --> 10:17.115
Did it sound to you like she
was reading from a script?

10:17.117 --> 10:20.719
Sounded more to me like
she was taking dictation.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.053
George Clinton
can have her.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.588
She's dead to me.

10:23.590 --> 10:26.091
You do know that
"she's dead to me"

10:26.093 --> 10:28.059
is just an expression?

10:28.061 --> 10:30.729
And so we
bid farewell

10:30.731 --> 10:33.598
to Evelyn Champagne
Brunch Brown,

10:33.600 --> 10:38.403
aka Cookie, first host
of   <i>Friday Night Videos,</i>

10:38.405 --> 10:40.739
former long-haul truck driver,

10:40.741 --> 10:45.410
five-time Libertarian candidate
for mayor, and Jezebel.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.079
There's no place
for you in Heaven.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.748
Amen.

10:49.750 --> 10:54.619
I now ask her son
if he would say a few words.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.287
Go on.
This is ridiculous.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.289
I'm not speaking
at Mom's fake...

10:58.291 --> 11:01.493
Get up there,
you're her only son.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.933
(sobbing):
Mama!

11:08.935 --> 11:10.602
Mommy!

11:10.604 --> 11:12.003
Too soon!

11:12.005 --> 11:13.805
(sobbing)

11:13.807 --> 11:17.442
I once accidentally saw you pee,

11:17.444 --> 11:19.477
and I didn't stop watching!

11:19.479 --> 11:21.546
(sobbing)

11:25.117 --> 11:28.787
All right, Lefkowitz, you
brought donuts for everybody.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.954
No, this is my lunch.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.489
What do you want?

11:31.491 --> 11:34.292
Well, hot shot, since you
saved us a bunch of money,

11:34.294 --> 11:35.827
I thought we'd throw
a company picnic.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.462
You're a family man, right?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.664
What have I said
up to this point?

11:39.666 --> 11:40.799
That you have
a wife and kid.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.800
Boy or girl?

11:41.802 --> 11:44.302
(laughs)
Lefkowitz.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.039
I guess it's time
to rent me some Mexicans

11:48.041 --> 11:50.275
or some blacks.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.312
Shut the front door.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.881
You're saying
you were with two girls?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.717
Yep, and if you add
both of 'em together,

11:58.719 --> 12:00.719
they were almost
age appropriate.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.520
(laughs)

12:02.522 --> 12:05.523
Say, blood,
where you get these bitches?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.192
Let me get this straight.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.661
Your dad is having relations
with young ladies

12:09.663 --> 12:12.230
only a day after fake-burying
your mother,

12:12.232 --> 12:14.833
who-- let us not forget--
is out with George Clinton

12:14.835 --> 12:17.068
getting funked
six ways from Sunday?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.169
Yes.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.005
Cleveland,
you are white trash.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.007
(laughter)

12:23.009 --> 12:25.844
Dad, I'm gonna help you
make things right with Mom.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.345
Forget that; I'm headed home.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.747
I got some Craigslist Asians

12:28.749 --> 12:30.882
gonna meet me there
in a half hour.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.619
Oh, he gonna get him some
and dim sum.

12:36.555 --> 12:41.392
Daddy, are you
and the Asian ladies decent?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.394
I'm gonna go swat
the tetherball out back

12:43.396 --> 12:44.963
till he gets home.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.134
(sobbing)

12:53.038 --> 12:54.873
Dad?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.207
She's dead, Cleveland.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.242
What are you doing?

12:57.244 --> 12:59.110
Where are
the Asian ladies?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.045
I made 'em up, Cleveland.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.547
It's no fun messing around
when there's no one waiting

13:02.549 --> 13:04.783
at home for you
to slap you upside the head.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.551
She ain't coming back.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.619
(sobbing)

13:13.259 --> 13:16.795
Dad, can we get
badminton for Easter?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.902
I took it too far
this time, Cleveland,

13:23.904 --> 13:26.104
and now I realize
just how much I love her.

13:26.106 --> 13:30.308
The best thing I ever had
is gone forever.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.111
Dad, look at yourself
in the mirror.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.746
I'm fat.

13:34.748 --> 13:38.116
Look at us, a
couple of schmoes--

13:38.118 --> 13:40.318
one fat, one
heartbroke.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.754
You know what? Instead
of sitting here moping,

13:42.756 --> 13:44.589
get out there and
fight for Mom,

13:44.591 --> 13:46.291
and I'm gonna order
sliced tomatoes

13:46.293 --> 13:49.127
with my double cheeseburger
instead of fries--

13:49.129 --> 13:50.428
or maybe I'll get
the fries, too.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.263
I'll eat the tomatoes first,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.766
but I'll eat the fries
if I'm still hungry.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.335
I ain't never had to fight
for no woman in my life.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.436
That's what losers do.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.406
Hello, I did that.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.676
And I won the
love of my life.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.010
Think about it,

14:06.012 --> 14:07.445
and I'm going to
have a cheeseburger.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.280
And you know what?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.015
No tomatoes.

14:11.017 --> 14:15.854
Actually, avocado--
that's a good fat, like me.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.324
(children laughing)

14:19.326 --> 14:21.326
Don't mess
this up for me.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.294
I'm living my dream.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.197
Now, I've paid you both
handsomely to know your roles.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.334
Again, Roberta,
you are my wife Jane.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.169
Our son was an accident.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.704
You've talked yourself
into loving me

14:32.706 --> 14:34.472
because I'm a good provider.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.541
And that's why I drink.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.142
Perfect.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.311
Look, I'll be around
for the intros, photos,

14:40.313 --> 14:42.981
or when you need your son
to be in a sack race,

14:42.983 --> 14:44.349
but the rest
of the time,

14:44.351 --> 14:48.319
you can catch a brother
at the swangs!

14:48.321 --> 14:49.320
Perfect.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.322
Okay, showtime.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.192
Frank, you family-having
son of a gun.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.226
Nice to meet you.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.362
Well, hello there,
little guy.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.998
You look
just like your dad.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.833
Wow, that's a kick in the b...

15:01.835 --> 15:03.167
(chuckles)

15:03.169 --> 15:05.003
Run and play on
the swings, son.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.338
Swangs!

15:07.340 --> 15:10.742
(sighs)
Kids-- they
grow up so fast.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.577
So, why you keeping
Frank so late at work?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.279
You see he's
got a kid.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.248
Whoa, Jane.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.685
Don't you raise your fist
to me, you sad, little man.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.853
You know what?

15:21.855 --> 15:23.855
This is stupid dumb.
Screw this.

15:23.857 --> 15:28.826
I'm going to go make out with
my boyfriend in his mouth.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.196
(groans nervously)

15:32.198 --> 15:34.265
Jane!

15:37.102 --> 15:39.103
Wait!

15:39.105 --> 15:42.607
Why are they always fighting?

15:42.609 --> 15:43.875
(cries)

15:43.877 --> 15:46.978
Does anybody want
to buy me a toy?

15:53.285 --> 15:56.120
Mr. Oxnard, sir,
I-I want to apologize

15:56.122 --> 15:58.890
for that "situation"
at the picnic.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.425
Apologize for what?

16:00.427 --> 16:03.394
You handled that with
class and dignity.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.397
I've had marital problems with
my young, black wife, too.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.565
Like what?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.467
Oh, she didn't like
my brother watching us.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.469
Look, Lefkowitz, I'm
gonna get right to it.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.304
I'm going to give
you Myron's job.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.406
He'll figure out a way
to support his kids,

16:15.408 --> 16:16.808
even the one
in the chair.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.977
Mr. Oxnard, you're a prince.

16:18.979 --> 16:22.413
I've dreamed of an offer
like that my whole life,

16:22.415 --> 16:24.782
but I haven't been honest
with you.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.418
I'm not a high school graduate.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.954
Myron went to Harvard
and he's a total moron.

16:29.956 --> 16:33.791
Be that as it may, I can only
worry about Frank Lefkowitz,

16:33.793 --> 16:37.328
and Frank Lefkowitz
has got to get his GED.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.597
Well, Lefkowitz, there will
always be a desk for you

16:39.599 --> 16:41.432
